Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. Jiangsu has seen a situation of comprehensive leap forward in all its work at the very beginning of this year.

The people of northern Jiangsu, with their revolutionary tradition, have put forward the goal of striving to catch up with southern Jiangsu. The southern Jiangsu region, with its experience in high yields, has proposed "three wheat crops (wheat, barley, naked barley) catching up with rice, rapeseed surpassing the three wheat crops, beans and grass (grass is a green manure crop) doubling, ten edges (village edges, field edges, and other scattered land) competing with large fields, striving for high yields in every item, and reaching a new level." Yangzhong County, which won the province's highest per-unit yield of three wheat crops last year, is even more motivated this year and determined to win the championship again. Jiangyin, Kunshan, and Shuyang counties, which are closely catching up with Yangzhong County, are determined to compete with Yangzhong. The poor teams that just shook off poverty last year are even more confident and motivated this year. Ninety-nine poor teams in Lianshui County that have changed their appearance are determined to achieve "grain and oil increasing, cotton leaping, one pig per person and one hundred yuan, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries leaping forward together, and surpassing rich teams in another year." All these slogans reflect the people's desire to go all out and continue to leap forward. Although it is the depths of winter, the "spring mood" is very strong in both southern and northern Jiangsu, and a situation of mutual chasing and mutual assistance is appearing everywhere. Ganyu County did a good job of deep plowing of spring sweet potato fields early, and after Donghai County received the news, it organized 2,000 cadres to "learn from experience." After returning, they launched a ten-day blitz, and the specifications and standards exceeded those of Ganyu. The Secretary of the Ganyu County Party Committee led secretaries of party committees at all levels to visit Donghai County. After returning, they immediately organized more than 80,000 people and more than 10,000 head of livestock to rework all the sweet potato fields that did not meet the standards.

People have summarized an experience from the leap forward in the previous two years, that is, "early action is a hundred times better, every step is proactive, striving for perfection, and achieving high yields and bumper harvests." Therefore, regardless of whether it is northern or southern Jiangsu, high-yield or low-yield areas, this year's production is being started early in accordance with high standards. Xuzhou Prefecture put forward the slogan "active in spring, work hard in winter," made early preparations for the greening of the three wheat crops and spring sowing, and launched a "four catch-up" campaign of late seedlings catching up with early seedlings, weak seedlings catching up with strong seedlings, lean fields catching up with fertile fields, and distant fields catching up with nearby fields. Currently, 86% of the wheat fields in the prefecture have been top-dressed, and the number of third-class seedlings has been greatly reduced compared with the same period last year. Of the five million mu of winter fallow land in the prefecture, 94% has been plowed and cultivated, four times more than the area plowed in the same period last year. Many communes have also combined deep plowing with transporting spring sowing base fertilizer to the fields. In the past, sweet potato warm bed seedling raising would not start until after the vernal equinox at the earliest, but now, with the winter snow sealing the ground, Bajishi Commune in Pixian County has already made preparations for sweet potato warm bed seedling raising. Dongtai County in Yancheng Prefecture broke with convention and deep plowed and fertilized all 500,000 mu of wheat fields in the county that were prepared for intercropping cotton before the ground froze, creating favorable conditions for a bumper harvest of cotton and grain this year.

    江苏春季生产要求实现高标准
    据新华社南京讯　江苏今年一开头，各项工作就出现全面跃进的形势。
    有着革命传统的苏北人民，提出奋力赶江南的目标。有着高产经验的苏南地区，提出要“三麦（小麦、大麦、元麦）赶水稻，油菜超三麦，豆草（草是绿肥作物）翻一番，十边（村边、田边等零散土地）赛大田，项项夺高产，更上一重天。”去年夺得全省三麦单产冠军的扬中县，今年干劲更大，决心再夺冠军。紧紧追赶扬中县的江阴、昆山、沭阳等县，立志要和扬中比个高低。去年刚刚摆脱穷困面貌的穷队，今年更是信心百倍，干劲倍增。涟水县九十九个改变面貌的穷队，决心要在今年做到“粮油加番棉花跳，每人一猪一百元，林牧副渔齐跃进，再干一年超富队。”所有这些口号，都反映了人们鼓足干劲，继续跃进的要求。当前虽是隆冬腊月，但江南江北却是“春意”很浓，处处出现你追我赶，边赛边帮之势。赣榆县春甘薯田深翻工作搞得又早又好，东海县得信后，便组织两千多干部去“取经”，回来突击十天，规格标准超过了赣榆。赣榆县委书记率领各级党委书记到东海县参观，回来又立即组织八万多人和一万多犋牲口，把八不合规格的甘薯田全部返工。
    人们从前两年的跃进中总结出了一条经验，就是“一早百早，着着主动、精益求精，高产丰收。”因此，不论苏北苏南、高产地区低产地区，今年各项生产都按照高标准的要求，早早动手。徐州专区提出“春天活，冬天干”的口号，提前做好三麦返青和春播准备，并且开展晚苗赶早苗，弱苗赶旺苗，瘦田赶肥田，远地赶近地的“四赶”运动，目前全区麦田中有86％已追过肥，三类苗比去年同期大为减少。全区五百万亩冬闲田，已有94％翻好耕好，比去年同期翻耕面积多了四倍。许多公社还结合深耕把春播基肥运到了田头。往年最早要到春分后才开始甘薯温床育苗，现在冬雪封地，邳县八集公社却已为甘薯温床育苗做好准备。盐城专区东台县打破常规，把全县五十万亩准备套种棉花的麦田，在封冻前全部在麦行里深耕、施肥一遍，为今年棉粮丰收创造了有利条件。
