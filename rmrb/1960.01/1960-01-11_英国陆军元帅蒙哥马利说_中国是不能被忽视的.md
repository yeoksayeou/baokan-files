    英国陆军元帅蒙哥马利说
    中国是不能被忽视的
    新华社新德里9日电　印度报业托辣斯报道，英国陆军元帅蒙哥马利8日晚间在离新德里动身去伦敦之前对记者说，他同尼赫鲁就国际形势，其中包括印中关系问题作了长谈。
    据报道，蒙哥马利说，他非常想去北京。他说，中国是有六亿人口的世界上最大的国家。“我认为，如果联合国中没有中国，我们就不能真正着手解决国际问题。”他说，在讨论世界问题和世界和平的时候，中国是不能被忽视的。
    消息说，蒙哥马利说，所谓中国真正的政府在台湾的说法是完全不合逻辑的。我认为，真正的中国政府在北京。
    消息说，蒙哥马利还认为东西方集团间的紧张关系日渐趋于缓和。
