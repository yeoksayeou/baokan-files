    The Door to Science and Technology is Open
    Ruan Xin
    Seeing ten veteran workers from Jiangxi gloriously appointed as engineers fills me with excitement. For the sake of the continuous leap-forward development of our cause, we urgently need more technical talents who wholeheartedly serve the socialist cause, and we urgently need more proletarian red experts. Therefore, every new red expert that emerges is equivalent to adding a most precious asset to our collective wealth. And every time this happens, we cannot help but feel a sense of joy as if we have found a treasure. Especially when we see a worker grow into a red expert, we become extraordinarily excited. Because within the working class lies a reserve of countless red experts. We can imagine that in the broad masses of workers, through the socialist construction movement, cultivating batches of red experts will greatly expand our red expert team! And the ten veteran workers from Jiangxi are only a part of the red experts emerging from the ranks of workers. The emergence of red experts in batches from the working masses is the result of the unprecedented development of our cause; and the emergence of these experts, in turn, will greatly promote the development of our cause.
    The ten veteran workers all "suffered the cruel persecution and exploitation of the reactionary ruling class and lost the opportunity to study from an early age." One can imagine the extent of their lack of culture, science, and technical knowledge. However, because they were able to "under the kind cultivation of the Party, after a long period of class struggle, continuously improve their political consciousness, love the Party, love the socialist cause, and selflessly fight for the collective interests"; and they were also able to "under the cultivation of the Party, tenaciously study culture and delve into technology." Thus, ordinary workers who lacked culture developed into red engineers who mastered rich technical knowledge and had many technical creations. Doesn't this powerfully illustrate that even people who have not read books before can completely master technical knowledge in production practice through "studying culture and delving into technology"? Doesn't this powerfully illustrate that the threshold of the field of science and technology is not as high as some people imagine, but is open to all workers, and everyone with ambition can step forward and enter?
    In this regard, some of our comrades with lower cultural levels and older ages have not completely resolved their ideological problems. They think this way: they are old and have no culture, so they should honestly do some "due diligence" work for the Party and the people within their capabilities. Some of these comrades are indeed working hard, and they also have the desire to work hard for the Party. However, although their hearts are loyal, their ambitions are not high enough, their minds are not completely liberated, and their views are still somewhat one-sided. For example, considering work or labor that does not improve culture, delve into technology, or lack creativity as "due diligence," is it "excessive" for those who have great ambitions to be both red and expert, dare to create, and dare to climb the peaks of science? If these ten veteran workers in Jiangxi had also emphasized their old age and lack of culture and did not study culture and delve into technology, Tang Chengao would not have been able to create the "sleeper stacking rail fastening method," Wang Enhou would not have been able to create the "train generator," and others would not have made those outstanding contributions. It can be seen that whether or not a person can become an engineer is naturally a small matter, but whether or not they can make more contributions to the Party and the people, and thereby enable our cause to develop faster, is a major matter that no one loyal to the socialist cause can ignore. Becoming a red expert is a goal that everyone (including those not of proletarian origin) strives to achieve, and our workers need even more to have the spirit of striving for the top!

    科学技术的大门敞开着
    阮欣
    看到江西十位老工人荣任工程师，心情不禁一阵阵地激动。为了我们事业的不断跃进发展，多么迫切需要有更多的全心全意为社会主义事业服务的技术人才，多么迫切需要有更多的无产阶级的红色专家。因此，每有一个新的红色专家出现，都等于在我们集体财富中增加了一份最宝贵的财产。而每当这个时候，我们也总不免都有一种如获珍宝般的高兴。特别是，当我们看到一个工人成长为红色专家的时候，就会分外的激动。因为在工人阶级中，蕴藏有无数红色专家的后备。我们可以设想一下，在广大工人群众中，通过社会主义建设运动，培养出一批又一批红色专家来，这会使我们的红色专家队伍得到多么迅速的扩大！而江西的十位老工人，只不过是工人队伍中涌现出来的红色专家的一部分。劳动群众中红色专家成批地涌现，是我们事业空前发展的结果；而这些专家的出现，转过来又要大大促进我们事业的发展。
    十位老工人，都是“经受过反动统治阶级的残酷迫害剥削，从小就失去读书求学的机会”的。他们缺乏文化和科学、技术知识的程度，可想而知，但是，由于他们既能够“在党的亲切培养下，经过长期阶级斗争的锻炼，政治觉悟不断提高，热爱党、热爱社会主义事业，能够为集体利益忘我战斗”；又能“在党的培养下，顽强学习文化、钻研技术”。于是，缺乏文化的普通工人，便发展成为掌握了丰富的技术知识，有着不少技术创造的红色工程师了。这不是有力地说明了，即使原来没有读过书的人，也完全有可能在生产实践中，通过“学习文化、钻研技术”而掌握技术知识吗？这不是有力地说明了，科学技术领域的门阶，并不像一些人所想像的那样高不可攀，而是向一切劳动者敞开着大门，每一个有志于此的人都可挺身走进去的吗？
    在这方面，我们还有一些文化程度较低而又年纪稍大的同志，没有完全解决思想问题。他们这样想，年纪大了，又没有文化，还是老老实实，在可能范围内为党和人民作一些“本分”的工作吧。这些同志，有的也确是辛辛勤勤地埋头工作，他们也有努力为党工作的愿望。但是，他们心虽忠，志却不够高，思想也还没有完全解放，看法也还有些片面。比如说，把不去提高文化钻研技术，缺乏创造性的工作或劳动，看作是“本分”，难道那些具有又红又专的大志，勇于创造，敢于攀登科学高峰的人，是一种“非分”吗？如果江西的这十位老工人，也那样强调年纪大，没文化而不去学习文化钻研技术，唐承鳌就创造不了“枕木垛扣轨法”，王恩厚就创制不成“列车发电机”，其他的人也就不会作出那些出色贡献。可见，一个人能不能作一个工程师，自然是一件小事，但能不能对党对人民作出更多的贡献，能不能从而使我们的事业有更快的发展，却是一件大事，不容任何忠于社会主义事业的人所忽视的。成为红色专家，是每一个人（包括非无产阶级出身的）所力求达到的目标，而我们工人更需要有力争上游的气概！
