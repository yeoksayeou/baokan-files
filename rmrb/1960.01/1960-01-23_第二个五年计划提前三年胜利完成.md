The Second Five-Year Plan Was Successfully Completed Three Years Ahead of Schedule

In 1959, the total value of industrial and agricultural output increased by 31.1% compared to 1958 and by 94.4% compared to 1957.

Steel: 13.35 million tons Coal: 347.8 million tons Grain: 540.1 billion jin Cotton: 48.2 million dan

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd News: News bulletin on the development of the national economy in 1959

Due to the people of the whole country adhering to the general line of socialist construction, adhering to the Great Leap Forward, adhering to the People's Communes, and carrying out a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy, the plan for developing the national economy in 1959 has been overfulfilled. The great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on opposing right-leaning, boosting morale, and completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule has been successfully realized.

According to preliminary statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, in 1959, the total value of industrial and agricultural output reached 241.3 billion yuan, an increase of 31.1% compared to 1958. Among them: the total value of industrial output reached 163 billion yuan, an increase of 39.3%; the total value of agricultural output reached 78.3 billion yuan, an increase of 16.7%. The output of major industrial and agricultural products: steel (excluding native steel) reached 13.35 million tons, an increase of 67% compared to 1958; pig iron (excluding native iron) reached 20.5 million tons, an increase of 115%; raw coal reached 347.8 million tons, an increase of 29%; electricity generation reached 41.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 51%; crude oil reached 3.7 million tons, an increase of 63.4%; cement reached 12.27 million tons, an increase of 32%; timber reached 41.2 million cubic meters, an increase of 18%; chemical fertilizers reached 1.333 million tons, an increase of 64.4%; metal-cutting machine tools reached 70,000 units, an increase of 40%; paper reached 2.13 million tons (including 1.7 million tons of machine-made paper), an increase of 31%; sugar reached 1.13 million tons, an increase of 26%; salt reached 11.04 million tons, an increase of 6%; cotton yarn reached 8.25 million pieces, an increase of 35%; cotton cloth reached 7.5 billion meters, an increase of 32%; grain reached 540.1 billion jin, an increase of 8%; cotton reached 48.2 million dan, an increase of 14.76%.

The total amount of basic construction investment within the state budget was 26.7 billion yuan, an increase of 24.5% compared to 1958. There were 1,341 above-quota construction projects under construction, of which 671 were fully or partially completed and put into production; there were 75,000 below-quota construction projects undertaken by county-level and above, of which 54,000 were completed. In addition, the People's Communes also undertook a large number of small-scale construction projects.

The total volume of freight transported by various means of transportation reached 2.212 billion tons, an increase of 67% compared to 1958. Among them, the volume of railway freight reached 542 million tons, an increase of 42%.

The total retail sales of social commodities reached 63.8 billion yuan, an increase of 16.4% compared to 1958. The total value of year-end inventory in commercial departments increased by 26% compared to the same period in 1958. The market is prosperous and prices are stable. In the first half of 1959, due to the rapid growth of purchasing power, the supply of a small portion of commodities on the market was once tight, but this situation has long passed.

Due to the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the national income in 1959 increased by 21.6% compared to 1958. The state's fiscal revenue in 1959 reached 54 billion yuan, an increase of 29% compared to 1958.

All of this shows that the adjusted targets of the 1959 plan, passed by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in August 1959, have been greatly overfulfilled. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Chinese people have achieved a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the national economy in 1959.

Due to the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, the Second Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) for the development of the national economy in China, proposed by the first meeting of the Eighth National Congress of the Party in September 1956 and approved by the State Council in February 1957, has been successfully completed three years ahead of schedule. The Second Five-Year Plan stipulated that the total value of industrial and agricultural output in 1962 should increase by about 75% compared to 1957, but in 1959 it had already increased by 94.4% compared to 1957; the total value of industrial output should increase by about 100%, but in 1959 it had already increased by 131.5%; the total value of agricultural output should increase by about 35%, but in 1959 it had already increased by 45.8%; the national income should increase by about 50%, but in 1959 it had already increased by 62.86%. The completion of the output of major products of heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture is shown in the following table:

		Output planned for the Second Five-Year Plan in 1962		Output in 1959
I. Heavy Industry
	Steel		10.5-12 million tons			13.35 million tons
	Raw Coal	190-210 million tons			347.8 million tons
	Electricity Generation	40-43 billion kWh			41.5 billion kWh
	Crude Oil	5-6 million tons				3.7 million tons
	Aluminum Ingot	100-120 thousand tons			70.4 thousand tons
	Chemical Fertilizer	3-3.2 million tons			1.333 million tons
	Metallurgical Equipment	30-40 thousand tons			205 thousand tons
	Power Generation Equipment	1.4-1.5 million kW			2.15 million kW
	Metal Cutting Machine Tools	60-65 thousand units			70 thousand units
	Timber		31-34 million cubic meters		41.2 million cubic meters
	Cement		12.5-14.5 million tons			12.27 million tons
II. Light Industry
	Cotton Yarn	8-9 million pieces			8.25 million pieces
	Cotton Cloth	7.29-8.06 billion meters			7.5 billion meters
	Salt		10-11 million tons			11.04 million tons
	Edible Vegetable Oil	3.1-3.2 million tons			1.46 million tons
	Sugar		2.4-2.5 million tons			1.13 million tons
	Machine-Made Paper	1.5-1.6 million tons			1.7 million tons
III. Agriculture
	Grain		About 500 billion jin			540.1 billion jin
	Cotton		About 48 million dan			48.2 million dan
	Soybeans	About 25 billion jin			23 billion jin
	Pigs		About 250 million heads		180 million heads
	Cattle		About 90 million heads			65.43 million heads
	Horses		About 11 million heads			7.6 million heads
	Sheep		About 170 million heads			112.53 million heads

It can be seen from the above table that: except for eleven indicators such as crude oil, aluminum ingots, chemical fertilizers, cement, edible vegetable oil, sugar, soybeans, pigs, cattle, horses, and sheep which have not yet been completed, the output of major industrial and agricultural products such as steel, raw coal, electricity generation, metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, metal-cutting machine tools, timber, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, salt, machine-made paper, grain, and cotton in 1959 has reached or exceeded the targets for 1962 stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan. Among them, the output of products that have a decisive effect on the development of the national economy in 1959 exceeded the original targets for 1962 by a large margin. For example, steel exceeded by 1.35 million to 2.85 million tons, raw coal exceeded by 137.8 million to 157.8 million tons, metallurgical equipment exceeded by 165,000 to 175,000 tons, power generation equipment exceeded by 650,000 to 750,000 kW, metal-cutting machine tools exceeded by 5,000 to 10,000 units, and grain exceeded by 40 billion jin.

Achieved a High-Speed, Proportional, and Comprehensive Great Leap Forward

In 1959, the national economy thoroughly implemented the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture and simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry under the premise of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, thus achieving a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward. In this year, all sectors of the national economy achieved high-speed and proportional development. The development speed of heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture was very high. This fact powerfully demonstrates that the proportional relationships between these sectors and within these sectors are coordinated. Compared to 1958, industry increased by 39.3% and agriculture increased by 16.7%, with the growth rate of agriculture relatively higher (the ratio of industrial to agricultural growth was four to one during the First Five-Year Plan period, 2.65 to one in 1958, and 2.35 to one in 1959). Within industry, heavy industry increased by 43.3% and light industry increased by 34%, with the growth rate of light industry also relatively higher (the ratio of heavy to light industry growth was 1.98 to one during the First Five-Year Plan period, 3.06 to one in 1958, and 1.27 to one in 1959). The development speed of some weak links in the national economy was even faster. For example, in transportation, the volume of freight transported by modern means of transportation increased by 59%, and the volume of freight transported by civilian means of transportation increased by 74%. Both exceeded the growth rate of industrial and agricultural production. This improved the situation where transportation could not keep up with the needs of production development. In terms of electricity, the electricity generation in this year reached 41.5 billion kWh, an increase of 51% compared to 1958; the output of power generation equipment reached 2.15 million kW, an increase of 1.69 times compared to 1958. Both exceeded the growth rate of the entire industry. This improved the electricity supply situation.

Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Developed Rapidly, Technological Innovation Was Widely Carried Out

During the Great Leap Forward in 1959, while the large-scale, modern production and construction undertakings undertaken by the central government achieved great development, the small and medium-sized, simple method production and construction undertakings undertaken by local governments also achieved great development. In 1959, the total output value of local industries increased by 39.7% compared to 1958. The small-scale, indigenous method production enterprises established in 1958 have, after rectification, expanded their production scale and improved their production technology. In 1959, the national output of pig iron (excluding native iron) reached 20.5 million tons, of which more than one-half, or 11.05 million tons, was produced by small and medium-sized enterprises. This is 1.52 million tons more than the 9.53 million tons of pig iron produced by all foreign methods in 1958. Of the 13.35 million tons of steel produced nationwide in 1959, more than one-third, or 4.72 million tons, was produced by small and medium-sized converters. The widespread development of small and medium-sized enterprises has greatly accelerated the speed of industrial development, improved the layout of industry, cultivated a large number of skilled workers and management cadres, and made industry and agriculture more closely integrated.

In 1959, employees on all fronts continued to promote the communist style of combining seeking truth from facts with daring to think, speak, and act, and promoted the spirit of combining practical work, hard work, and clever work, and more widely carried out the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. Various production and construction undertakings were not only done more, faster, but also better and more economically. In this year, the labor productivity of industrial production workers increased by 15.5%. Tens of thousands of new products were successfully trial-produced. The quality of products has generally improved. The quality of pig iron produced by small blast furnaces has approached the level of large blast furnaces. At the same time, the costs of all departments have been reduced. Industrial departments reduced by 6%, the construction engineering department system reduced by 13.5%, the transportation department reduced by 14.6%, and the circulation costs of commerce also decreased.

Cultural and Educational Undertakings Greatly Developed, People's Living Standards Improved

While economic undertakings were greatly developing, educational, scientific, and cultural undertakings also achieved great development. In 1959, full-time institutions of higher learning enrolled 270,000 students, with a total of 810,000 students enrolled, an increase of 23% compared to 1958, approaching the target of 850,000 students set for 1962 in the Second Five-Year Plan. Various types of secondary schools had 12.9 million students; primary schools had 90 million students. In addition, the total number of students in secondary and higher-level spare-time schools reached 10 million, an increase of 94% compared to 1958. Specialized scientific research institutions, scientific research institutions in universities, and scientific research institutions in economic departments and enterprises have all greatly developed. The development of cultural undertakings such as publishing, broadcasting, film, and drama has been rapid. Sports and health movements have also achieved great success.

On the basis of the continued Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of labor productivity, the material living standards of the people across the country have also improved. In 1959, the average wage of employees (excluding new employees) increased by about 5% compared to 1958. The state's expenditure on labor insurance, medical expenses, welfare expenses, and other collective welfare undertakings for employees increased by more than 16% compared to 1958. The average income of members of rural People's Communes increased by about 10% compared to 1958. Among the consumer goods supplied to the people by the state through commercial departments, grain increased by 6.5%, cotton cloth increased by 23%, knitwear increased by 38.7%, machine-made paper increased by 13.7%, and cigarettes increased by 15.9%. The supply of most other daily necessities also increased to varying degrees. Only the commercial supply of meat, eggs, and other products still needs some time to increase significantly.

People's Communes Played a Great Role in the Great Leap Forward

In the continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1959, the People's Communes played a great role. 1959 was a year in which our country encountered severe natural disasters not seen in decades. The total area affected by disasters nationwide reached 650 million mu, accounting for 30% of the total sown area. In most parts of eight provinces, it did not rain for three or four consecutive months in the summer, causing severe drought to nearly 400 million mu of farmland. It was only because the People's Communes gave full play to the superiority of large scale and high degree of collectivization, effectively organized the vast number of commune members to carry out heroic disaster relief struggles, and implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, that agricultural production still achieved a great leap forward. In addition to the bumper harvests of grain and cotton, the output of soybeans, vegetables, peanuts, sugarcane and sugar beets, fruits, flue-cured tobacco, tea, etc., all increased to varying degrees. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery have also achieved comprehensive development. The afforestation area in 1959 reached 280 million mu. The number of pigs in stock at the end of the year reached 180 million, an increase of 20 million compared to 1958. The number of large livestock also increased compared to 1958, reaching 85.38 million. Small poultry has also developed greatly. The "Small Autumn Harvest" movement to collect wild plants achieved great success. The output value of rural sideline occupations increased by more than 100% compared to 1958. The total output of aquatic products increased by 23.6% compared to 1958. Under the organization of the People's Communes, large-scale farmland water conservancy construction continued in 1959. In the year from October 1958 to September 1959, the amount of earth and stone work completed was 13 billion cubic meters, the newly added irrigation area reached 70 million mu, and a large number of existing water conservancy irrigation systems were improved. Since October 1959, even larger-scale farmland water conservancy construction is underway. The superiority of the People's Communes is also reflected in the great development of industry in rural areas. In 1959, the total output value of commune industry increased by 70% compared to 1958. The great development of commune industry has promoted the reform of agricultural tools and rural transportation tools, expanded the capacity for preliminary processing of agricultural and sideline products, improved the labor productivity of agriculture, and also increased the public accumulation and income of communes. The People's Communes have enabled the cultural, educational, and health undertakings in rural areas to develop vigorously. By the end of 1959, there were 25,000 agricultural middle schools and ordinary middle schools run by communes, and 270,000 primary schools run by communes. There were nearly 1 million cultural centers, libraries, and clubs run by communes. There were more than 200,000 hospitals and clinics run by communes. There were 3.9 million public canteens run by communes, and 3.69 million nurseries and kindergartens. After rectification in 1959, the People's Communes in our country have embarked on the road of consolidation and sound development.

Strive to Catch Up with Britain in the Output of Major Industrial Products Within Ten Years; Strive to Realize the National Agricultural Development Program Significantly Ahead of Schedule

The continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1959 laid the foundation for the situation of high-speed and proportional Great Leap Forward in the development of our national economy that began to appear in 1958. Due to rapid production development and continued improvement of living standards, the ideological awareness of all ethnic groups across the country has been unprecedentedly improved, unity has been unprecedentedly consolidated, and people are in high spirits and full of energy. The great achievements of 1959 powerfully prove that the general line of socialist construction, the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and the organizational form of the People's Communes proposed by the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong are completely correct. On the basis of the great victory in 1959, workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country are full of confidence, striving to achieve a continued leap forward in the national economy in 1960, striving to catch up with the level of Britain in the output of major industrial products within ten years, and striving to realize the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 significantly ahead of schedule.

    高举毛泽东思想的旗帜　坚持总路线坚持大跃进坚持人民公社
    第二个五年计划提前三年胜利完成
    1959年工农业总产值比1958年增长31．1％比1957年增长94．4％
    钢：1，335万吨　煤：34，780万吨　粮：5，401亿斤　棉：4，820万担
    新华社22日讯　关于一九五九年国民经济发展情况的新闻公报
    由于全国人民坚持社会主义建设总路线，坚持大跃进，坚持人民公社，开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约的群众运动，一九五九年发展国民经济计划已经超额完成。中国共产党八届八中全会关于反右倾、鼓干劲、提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大号召，已经胜利实现。
    根据国家统计局的初步统计，在一九五九年，工农业总产值达到二千四百一十三亿元，比一九五八年增长百分之三十一点一。其中：工业总产值达到一千六百三十亿元，增长百分之三十九点三；农业总产值达到七百八十三亿元，增长百分之十六点七。工农业主要产品的产量，钢（不包括土钢）达到一千三百三十五万吨，比一九五八年增长百分之六十七；生铁（不包括土铁）达到二千零五十万吨，增长百分之一百一十五；原煤达到三亿四千七百八十万吨，增长百分之二十九；发电量达到四百一十五亿度，增长百分之五十一；原油达到三百七十万吨，增长百分之六十三点四；水泥达到一千二百二十七万吨，增长百分之三十二；原木达到四千一百二十万立方米，增长百分之十八；化学肥料达到一百三十三万三千吨，增长百分之六十四点四；金属切削机床达到七万台，增长百分之四十；纸达到二百一十三万吨（其中机制纸一百七十万吨），增长百分之三十一；糖达到一百一十三万吨，增长百分之二十六；盐达到一千一百零四万吨，增长百分之六；棉纱达到八百二十五万件，增长百分之三十五；棉布达到七十五亿米，增长百分之三十二；粮食达到五千四百零一亿斤，增长百分之八；棉花达到四千八百二十万担，增长百分之十四点七六。
    国家预算内的基本建设投资总额完成了二百六十七亿元，比一九五八年增长百分之二十四点五。施工的限额以上的建设项目有一千三百四十一个，其中全部建成和部分建成而投入生产的有六百七十一个；县一级以上兴办的限额以下的建设项目有七万五千个，其中建设完工的有五万四千个。此外，人民公社还兴办了大量的小型的建设项目。
    各种运输工具的货运总量达到二十二亿一千二百万吨，比一九五八年增长百分之六十七。其中，铁路货运量达到五亿四千二百万吨，增长百分之四十二。
    社会商品零售总额达到六百三十八亿元，比一九五八年增长百分之十六点四。商业各部门年末库存总值比一九五八年同期增长百分之二十六。市场繁荣，物价稳定。一九五九年上半年，由于购买力迅速增长，市场上曾有一小部分商品供应紧张，这种情况早已成为过去。
    由于工农业生产的大发展，一九五九年的国民收入比一九五八年增长百分之二十一点六。一九五九年国家财政收入达到五百四十亿元，比一九五八年增长百分之二十九。
    所有这些表明，一九五九年八月全国人民代表大会常务委员会通过的一九五九年计划的调整指标，已经大大地超额完成了。我国人民在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，一九五九年又实现了国民经济的更好的全面的大跃进。
    由于一九五八年和一九五九年连续的大跃进，一九五六年九月党的第八届全国代表大会第一次会议提出的、一九五七年二月经国务院通过的我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划（一九五八年至一九六二年），已经提前三年胜利完成。第二个五年计划规定，工农业总产值一九六二年比一九五七年应增长百分之七十五左右，一九五九年比一九五七年已增长百分之九十四点四；工业总产值应增长一倍左右，一九五九年已增长百分之一百三十一点五；农业总产值应增长百分之三十五左右，一九五九年已增长百分之四十五点八；国民收入应增长百分之五十左右，一九五九年已增长百分之六十二点八六。重工业、轻工业、农业的主要产品产量的完成情况如下表：
    第二个五年计划规定的
    一九六二年产量        　一九五九年产量
    一、重工业
    钢　        1，050—1，200万吨    　  1，335万吨

    发电设备　  140—150万瓩　            215万瓩
    金属切削机床　6—6．5万台　           7万台
    原木　        3，100—3，400万立方米　4，120万立方米
    水泥        　1，250—1，450万吨    　1，227万吨
    二、轻工业
    棉纱　        800—900万件            825万件
    棉布　        72．9—80．6亿米      　75亿米
    盐　          1，000—1，100万吨　    1，104万吨
    食用植物油　  310—320万吨            146万吨
    糖　          240—250万吨        　  113万吨
    机制纸　      150—160万吨　          170万吨
    三、农业
    粮食　        5，000亿斤左右        　5，401亿斤
    棉花          4，800万担左右　        4，820万担
    大豆        　250亿斤左右　           230亿斤
    猪　          25，000万头左右         18，000万头
    牛　          9，000万头左右        　6，543万头
    马　          1，100万头左右        　760万头
    羊　          17，000万头左右　      11，253万头
    从上表可以看出：除原油、铝锭、化学肥料、水泥、食用植物油、糖、大豆、猪、牛、马、羊等十一项指标还没有完成外，钢、原煤、发电量、冶金设备、发电设备、金属切削机床、原木、棉纱、棉布、盐、机制纸、粮食、棉花等工农业主要产品，一九五九年的产量都达到了或者超过了第二个五年计划规定的一九六二年的指标。其中，对国民经济发展有决定性作用的产品，一九五九年的产量都比原来拟定的一九六二年指标超过很多。例如，钢超过一百三十五万到二百八十五万吨，原煤超过一亿三千七百八十万到一亿五千七百八十万吨，冶金设备超过十六万五千到十七万五千吨，发电设备超过六十五万到七十五万瓩，金属切削机床超过五千到一万台，粮食超过四百亿斤。
    实现了高速度的按比例的全面大跃进
    一九五九年的国民经济，贯彻执行了在优先发展重工业的条件下、工业和农业同时并举、重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针，因而实现了一个更好的全面的大跃进。在这一年，国民经济各部门都得到了高速度的和按比例的发展。重工业、轻工业、农业的发展速度都很高。这个事实有力地说明，这些部门之间的比例关系和这些部门内部的比例关系，是协调的。一九五九年比一九五八年，工业增长百分之三十九点三，农业增长百分之十六点七，农业增长速度相对地提高得更快一些（工业和农业增长速度的比例，第一个五年计划时期为四比一，一九五八年为二点六五比一，一九五九年为二点三五比一）。在工业中，重工业增长百分之四十三点三，轻工业增长百分之三十四，轻工业增长速度也相对地提高得更快一些（重工业和轻工业增长速度的比例，第一个五年计划时期为一点九八比一，一九五八年为三点零六比一，一九五九年为一点二七比一）。国民经济的某些薄弱环节，发展速度更快。例如，在运输方面，现代运输工具的货运量增长百分之五十九，民间运输工具的货运量增长百分之七十四。两者都超过了工农业生产增长的速度。这就使运输赶不上生产发展需要的状况有所改善。在电力方面，这一年的发电量达到四百一十五亿度，比一九五八年增长百分之五十一；发电设备的产量达到二百一十五万瓩，比一九五八年增长一点六九倍。两者都超过了整个工业的增长速度。这就使电力供应的状况有了改善。
    中小企业发展很快　技术革新广泛开展
    在一九五九年的大跃进中，在中央举办的、大型的、现代化的生产建设事业得到了巨大发展的同时，地方举办的、中小型的、简易方法的生产建设事业也得到了巨大的发展。一九五九年地方工业的总产值比一九五八年增长百分之三十九点七。一九五八年建立起来的小型的土法生产的企业，经过整顿，绝大多数的生产规模扩大了，生产技术提高了。一九五九年全国生铁（不包括土铁）的产量达到二千零五十万吨，其中由中小型企业生产的占二分之一以上，达一千一百零五万吨。这比一九五八年全部洋法生产的生铁九百五十三万吨还多一百五十二万吨。一九五九年全国钢产量一千三百三十五万吨中，由中小型转炉生产的占三分之一以上，达四百七十二万吨。中小型企业的普遍发展，大大加快了工业发展的速度，改善了工业的布局，培养了大量的技术工人和管理干部，并且使工业和农业更密切地结合起来。
    在一九五九年，各个战线上的职工继续发扬实事求是和敢想敢说敢做相结合的共产主义风格，发扬实干、苦干、巧干相结合的精神，更加广泛地开展了技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，各项生产建设事业不仅办得又多、又快，而且办得又好、又省。在这一年，工业部门生产工人的劳动生产率提高了百分之十五点五。试制成功的新产品数以万计。产品的质量普遍地有了提高。小高炉所生产的生铁，质量已经接近大高炉的水平。同时，各部门的成本都有了降低。工业部门降低了百分之六，建筑工程部系统降低了百分之十三点五，交通运输部门降低了百分之十四点六，商业的流转费用也有了降低。
    文教事业大发展　人民生活水平提高了
    在经济事业大发展的同时，教育科学文化事业也得到了大发展。在一九五九年，全日制的高等学校招生二十七万人，在校学生达到八十一万人，比一九五八年增长百分之二十三，接近第二个五年计划原订一九六二年达到的八十五万人的指标。各类中等学校学生达到一千二百九十万人；小学学生达到了九千万人。此外，中等和中等以上的业余学校的学生总数达到一千万人，比一九五八年增长百分之九十四。专门的科学研究机构、高等学校中的科学研究机构、经济部门和企业中的科学研究机构，都有很大的发展。出版、广播、电影、戏剧等项文化事业的发展都很快。体育运动和卫生运动，也都取得了很大的成就。
    在工农业生产继续大跃进和劳动生产率提高的基础上，全国人民的物质生活水平也提高了。一九五九年职工（不包括新职工）的平均工资比一九五八年增加百分之五左右。国家用于职工的劳动保险金、医药费、福利费以及其他集体福利事业的开支，比一九五八年增长百分之十六以上。农村人民公社社员的平均收入，比一九五八年增长百分之十左右。在国家通过商业部门供应给人民的生活消费品中，粮食增长百分之六点五，棉布增长百分之二十三，针织品增长百分之三十八点七，机制纸增长百分之十三点七，卷烟增长百分之十五点九。其他绝大多数生活必需品的供应量，也都有了不同程度的增长。只是肉类、蛋品等的商品供应量，还需要一个时间才能有较多的增长。
    人民公社在大跃进中发挥伟大作用
    在一九五九年国民经济的继续大跃进中，人民公社发挥了伟大的作用。一九五九年是我国遇到几十年来没有过的严重的自然灾害的一年。全国受灾面积共达六亿五千万亩，占全部播种面积的百分之三十。有八个省的大部分地方，在夏季连续三四个月没有下雨，使近四亿亩农田受到了严重的旱灾。只是由于人民公社发挥了规模大和集体化程度高的优越性，有效地组织了广大社员进行英勇的抗灾斗争，贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，农业生产才仍然得到了巨大的跃进。除粮食、棉花丰收以外，大豆、蔬菜、花生、甘蔗和甜菜、水果、烤烟、茶等的产量，都有了不同程度的增长。林、牧、副、渔各业也得到了全面的发展。一九五九年的造林面积达到了二亿八千万亩。猪的年末存栏数达到一亿八千万头，比一九五八年增加二千万头。大家畜也比一九五八年有所增加，达到八千五百三十八万头。小家禽也有很大发展。收集野生植物的“小秋收”运动获得了很大成绩。农村副业的产值比一九五八年增长一倍多。水产品总量比一九五八年增长百分之二十三点六。在人民公社的组织下，一九五九年继续进行了大规模的农田水利建设。从一九五八年十月到一九五九年九月的一年中，土方和石方的工程量完成了一百三十亿立方米，新增加的灌溉面积达到七千万亩，并且改善了大量原有的水利灌溉系统。从一九五九年十月以后，更大规模的农田水利建设正在进行中。人民公社的优越性，还表现在农村中工业的大发展上面。一九五九年公社工业的总产值比一九五八年增长百分之七十。公社工业的大发展，促进了农具和农村运输工具的改革，扩大了农副产品初步加工的能力，提高了农业的劳动生产率，同时也增加了公社的公共积累和社员的收入。人民公社使农村的文化、教育、卫生事业得到了蓬勃的发展。到一九五九年底，社办的农业中学和普通中学达到二万五千所，社办小学达到二十七万所。社办的文化馆、图书室、俱乐部达到近一百万个。社办医院和诊疗所达到二十万所以上。社办的公共食堂达到三百九十万个，托儿所、幼儿园达到三百六十九万个。经过一九五九年的整顿，我国的人民公社已经走上了巩固和健全发展的道路。
    争取十年内主要工业品产量赶上英国  争取大大提前实现全国农业发展纲要
    一九五九年国民经济的继续大跃进，奠定了在一九五八年开始出现的我国国民经济发展的又高速度、又按比例的大跃进的局面。由于生产迅速发展和生活继续改善，全国各族人民的觉悟空前提高，团结空前巩固，心情愉快，干劲十足。一九五九年的伟大成就有力地证明，中国共产党和毛泽东同志提出的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式是完全正确的。在一九五九年伟大胜利的基础上，全国的工人、农民和革命知识分子，正在满怀信心，争取在一九六零年实现国民经济的继续跃进，争取在十年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国的水平，争取大大提前实现一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要。
