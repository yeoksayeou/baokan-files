The Qaidam Basin, a high-altitude cold region 3,000 meters above sea level, achieved an exceptionally large harvest of grain in 1959. Total grain output increased nearly fortyfold compared to 1951. Large areas of high-yield and high-production fields emerged everywhere. The region had over 24,100 mu of wheat fields yielding over 1,000 jin per mu, with over 8,080 mu averaging over 800 jin per mu, over 590 mu averaging over 600 jin per mu, and over 3,710 mu averaging over 500 jin per mu. This is a victory for the Party's General Line, a victory for the Great Leap Forward, and a victory for the People's Communes.

    Agricultural Production Advances by Leaps and Bounds

Before liberation, Qaidam was a desert, sparsely populated, with grain sown on only a few thousand mu of small plots. Cultivation methods at that time were extremely backward, with yields of only a few dozen jin per mu. The comprehensive development of Qaidam is a recent phenomenon, dating back only a few years after liberation. In 1950, the Party dispatched a group of agricultural technicians to conduct surveys in the eastern and western parts of Qaidam. In 1951, the planting area was expanded to over 22,800 mu, with a total grain output of over 4 million jin and an average yield of 183 jin and 6 liang per mu. After 1955, with the development of various resources in Qaidam, agricultural production began to develop on a large scale. In particular, the formulation of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the emergence of the nationwide Great Leap Forward in 1958, as well as the victory of the socialist revolution movement in the pastoral areas, led Qaidam's agriculture onto the path of comprehensive leap forward and comprehensive prosperity.

Qaidam's agricultural production has always adhered to the principle of "walking on two legs." On the one hand, expanding and developing existing farmland; on the other hand, also based on the principles of "temporary first, permanent later; small-scale first, large-scale later; water control first, land reclamation later; and less investment, greater returns," vigorously reclaiming wasteland and establishing agricultural bases. In the pastoral areas, the Work Committee firmly implemented the policy of "livestock breeding as the mainstay, integration of agriculture and animal husbandry, and development of diversified operations," and vigorously supported agricultural production in the pastoral areas. In addition to providing loans to help herdsmen solve some agricultural investment issues, it also improved the production management and innovated cultivation techniques of the pastoral areas' agricultural economy through dispatching cadres, exchanging technical experiences, demonstrating land reclamation, and attaching importance to sorting out the herdsmen's existing farming experiences, so that the backward and primitive production methods were rapidly changed and improved. At the same time, a group of agricultural production experts were trained among ethnic minority herdsmen. In the task of establishing large-scale grain bases, the Party and the state systematically and step-by-step established twenty-two state-owned farms in the Qaidam Basin. These farms played a demonstrative role in the development of agriculture in the pastoral areas. By the first half of 1959, the planting area in the entire region had been expanded to over 390,000 mu, building a "ladder" for further large-scale land reclamation and agricultural development.

In order to ensure the vigorous advancement of agricultural production, especially grain production, the Party also called on the workers and staff of industrial and mining enterprises and the broad masses of cadres in Qaidam to develop non-staple food production through self-reliance. This ensured that state-owned farms and people's communes could concentrate their efforts on grain production; at the same time, it also accumulated experience and provided conditions for various organs and enterprises to establish their own small agricultural bases.

    Political Leadership Leads to Bumper Harvests

The history of agricultural production development in Qaidam eloquently proves that the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction is invincible. The great grain harvest in 1959 once again shows that even in the vast desert and millennial sandbar of Qaidam, where there is no production base, as long as we follow the Party's General Line, adhere to political leadership, and vigorously engage in mass movements, lush crops can grow and bountiful ears of wheat can be harvested.

The process of agricultural development in Qaidam is a process of continuous revolution and continuous progress. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959, we have conducted extensive and in-depth education on the General Line among the broad masses of farm workers and commune members, education on the prospects for the development of the basin, education on the significance of agricultural production for the development of various construction undertakings in Qaidam, etc., which stimulated the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, clarified the direction, enhanced confidence, and came up with solutions. The truth that "political leadership leads to bumper harvests" and "Marxism-Leninism produces grain" has been fully confirmed in Qaidam.

Another important "magic weapon" to guarantee the leap forward development of agriculture in Qaidam is the Party's mass line. Throughout the entire process of agricultural development in Qaidam, the Party has always adhered to vigorously engaging in mass movements. From the formulation of targets in the agricultural production of 1959, we launched a red flag movement of evaluation and competition among the farms and communes, and among the broad masses of agricultural workers and commune members, which lasted until the autumn harvest.

In leading the mass movement of agricultural production, the Party has always been full of enthusiasm, standing at the forefront of the movement, and leading the masses to advance along the path of more, faster, better, and more economical results. In the grain production of 1959, on the one hand, we insisted on implementing the policy of "simultaneously expanding the cultivated area and increasing the yield per unit area" and "taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way," mobilized the broad masses to reclaim wasteland, attached importance to carrying out the movement of large-scale high-yield and high-production, called on all departments to support the grain marshal's ascendance to the command, and transferred a large number of manpower, vehicles, fertilizers, and tools to support the needs of agricultural production, setting off a climax of the entire people fighting for grain; on the other hand, in each season of agricultural production, we put forward clear and loud slogans, and criticized and overcame negative thoughts and emotions that were unfavorable to production in various periods.

The people's commune system has opened up broad avenues for the great development of agriculture in Qaidam. The people's commune system has thoroughly changed the original scattered and nomadic production and lifestyle of the pastoral areas. After many herdsmen settled down, they engaged in agricultural production and reclaimed wasteland under the policy of "livestock breeding as the mainstay, integration of agriculture and animal husbandry, and development of diversified operations." Because the people's communes have more people and more strength, and a thicker foundation, they are able to carry out large-scale water conservancy and other undertakings. After communization, the entire region expanded the irrigated area of farmland by more than 119,500 mu. Especially because the people's communes in the Qaidam area are mostly agricultural-pastoral combinations, they can directly receive support from animal husbandry in terms of transportation and fertilizer, making the agriculture of the people's communes "more powerful," and developing faster. By 1959, fourteen of the twenty-two people's communes in the entire region had achieved grain self-sufficiency. The situation in the pastoral areas, where grain had long been dependent on external aid, has begun to change.

    Implement the "Eight-Character Constitution"

Adapting to the characteristics of high-altitude cold regions and comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, in accordance with the seasons, local conditions, and crops, is the basic reason for the great grain harvest in Qaidam.

The first problem to be faced in growing grain in Qaidam is the problem of improving saline-alkali land. Planting grain on saline-alkali land has always been a difficult problem in past "scientific" regulations. According to previous "scientific basis," crops cannot grow at all on land with an alkali content of more than 3/1000. However, under the leadership of the Party, the agricultural workers in Qaidam discarded this prejudice, broke superstitions, emancipated their minds, and planted grain on land with an alkali content of more than 80%, and achieved a great harvest. In recent years, under the guidance of the principle of "improving and utilizing simultaneously, finding experience through practice, summarizing and promoting," the entire region has improved a large amount of saline-alkali land. The entire Golmud Farm is saline-alkali land. In the first year of sowing wheat, the yield per mu was only 13.5 jin. But after gradual exploration and tenacious experimentation, they finally conquered the saline-alkali land. In 1959, this farm created a high-yield record of 353 jin per mu on 5,081 mu of land. The fact that Qaidam successfully improved saline-alkali land and achieved high grain yields once again shows the truth that "man can conquer nature."

All farms, communes, and agricultural leading departments in the entire region, also according to the characteristics of the Qaidam region, "obey the laws of heaven, respond to the advantages of the land," reasonably and effectively used the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, giving full play to Qaidam's advantages of abundant fertilizer sources, long sunshine hours, sufficient water sources (large ice reserves, the entire region is irrigated), strong winds (suitable for close planting), suitable temperature (large temperature difference between day and night, suitable for crop growth), dry climate (diseases and pests are not easy to breed and spread), and good soil quality, avoiding and overcoming the unfavorable conditions of high altitude and short frost-free period, and overcoming natural disasters such as frost and hail. As early as the winter of 1958, all communes and farms vigorously engaged in water conservancy, breaking ice to divert water, building reservoirs, canals, water storage ponds, digging wells, and digging springs, so that all the land was irrigated. During the preparation for plowing, all farms and communes seized the characteristics of abundant fertilizer sources, opened up more than 100 kinds of fertilizer sources, built small fertilizer plants locally, and applied an average of more than 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, which was more than doubled compared to 1958. In order to give full play to the fertility of virgin land, all farms and communes, while accumulating fertilizer, also vigorously engaged in deep plowing. Generally, fields were plowed to 30 centimeters, and high-yield fields were plowed to about 40 to 60 centimeters. In order to ensure a large-scale increase in grain production, all farms and communes, under the premise of deep plowing and more fertilizer, paid attention to reasonable close planting based on the windy characteristics of the basin. In the spring of 1959, spring wheat generally sowed 40 jin per mu, ensuring more than 450,000 seedlings. In view of the high altitude of the basin, the entire region also widely selected good varieties with strong adaptability and cold resistance, such as Nandada 2419 and Biyu Wheat, and carried out Ceresan and 666 pesticide treatment. In field management, in addition to closely adhering to each link and operating meticulously, all farms and communes also universally realized garden management in large high-yield fields.

The development of agriculture and the great grain harvest in Qaidam have established a "logistics base" for the rapid advancement of industrial construction, and prepared a material basis for the high-speed development of industry; at the same time, it has also provided a large amount of valuable practical experience and data for agricultural scientific research.

At present, the Party committees at all levels in Qaidam, the agricultural reclamation leading departments, all farms and communes, and relevant agricultural scientific and technological research institutions are systematically summarizing existing experiences to guide agricultural production in 1960 and beyond. The broad masses of workers, staff, farmers, and herdsmen are vigorously engaged in land reclamation, vigorously developing water conservancy, vigorously grasping deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation, setting off an even larger-scale winter production upsurge, and fighting to seize a grain harvest in 1960!

    柴达木盆地粮食大丰收
    1959年粮食总产量比1951年增长近四十倍

    拔海三千米高寒地带的柴达木盆地，1959年获得了粮食的特大丰收。粮食总产量比1951年增长近四十倍。大面积高额丰产田到处出现。全区小麦千斤田达二万四千一百多亩，小麦平均亩产在八百斤以上的有八千零八十多亩，六百斤以上的有五百九十多亩，五百斤以上的有三千七百一十多亩。这是党的总路线的胜利，是大跃进的胜利，是人民公社的胜利。
    农业生产阔步前进
    柴达木在解放以前，是一片荒漠，渺无人烟；只是在几千亩小块土地上播种粮食。当时的耕作方式极为落后，亩产只有几十斤。柴达木的全面开发，还是解放后最近几年的事。1950年，党派遣了一部分农业技术人员，到柴达木东、西部进行了考察。1951年，播种面积就扩大到二万二千八百多亩，粮食总产达到四百多万斤，平均亩产一百八十三斤六两。1955年以后，随着柴达木各种资源的开发，农业生产开始大规模发展；特别是1958年，党的社会主义建设总路线的制定和全国大跃进形势的出现，以及牧业区社会主义革命运动的胜利，使柴达木的农业走向了全面跃进、全面繁荣的道路。
    柴达木的农业生产，一直坚持着两条腿走路的方针。一方面扩大和发展原有的农田；另一方面还本着先临时、后永久，先小型、后大型，先治水、后开荒和投资少、收效大的原则，大力垦荒，建立农业基地。在牧业区，工委坚定地贯彻了“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针，大力扶植牧业区农业生产。除了发放贷款帮助牧民解决部分农业投资以外，并通过派遣干部、交流技术经验、垦荒示范和重视整理牧民已有的点滴耕作经验等办法，改善牧业区农业经济的生产管理和革新耕作技术，使落后的、原始的生产方式，迅速地得到改变和提高。同时在少数民族牧民中培养了一批农业生产能手。在建立大型粮食基地的任务中，党和国家有计划、有步骤地在柴达木盆地里，先后建立起二十二个国营农场。这些农场在牧业区农业的发展方面起了示范作用。到1959年上半年，全区播种面积已经扩大到三十九万多亩，为进一步更大规模地垦荒造田，发展农业，搭好了一架“梯子”。
    为保证农业生产，特别是粮食生产的阔步前进，党还号召柴达木的工矿企业职工和广大干部，自力更生发展副食品生产。这就保证了各国营农场和人民公社，能够集中力量从事粮食生产；同时，也为各机关、企业建立本单位小型农业基地积累了经验，提供了条件。
    政治挂帅就能丰收
    柴达木农业生产发展的历史，雄辩地证明了党的社会主义建设总路线无往而不胜。1959年的粮食大丰收，再一次表明：即使在千里荒漠、万年沙洲，没有任何生产基础的柴达木，只要遵循党的总路线，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，就能长出茂密的庄稼，结出丰硕的麦穗来。
    柴达木农业发展的过程，就是一个不断革命，不断前进的过程。几年来，特别是1958年大跃进和1959年继续跃进以来，我们在广大农场职工和社员群众中，广泛、深入地进行了总路线的教育，盆地发展的远景教育，农业生产对于柴达木各项建设事业发展的意义的教育等等，激发了广大群众的革命积极性，明确了方向，增强了信心，想出了办法。“政治挂帅就能丰收”、“马列主义出粮食”这一真理，在柴达木得到了充分的证实。
    保证柴达木农业飞跃发展的另一重要“法宝”，就是党的群众路线。在柴达木农业发展的全部过程中，党一直坚持了大搞群众运动。1959年的农业生产，从制定指标开始，我们就在各场、社之间，在广大农业职工和社员群众中，掀起了评比竞赛的红旗运动，一直坚持到秋收。
    在领导农业生产的群众运动中，党始终是满腔热情，站在运动的前头，领导群众沿着多快好省的道路前进。在1959年粮食生产中，我们一方面坚持贯彻了“扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量同时并举”和“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针，动员广大群众垦荒造田，重视大面积高额丰产运动的开展，号召各个部门支援粮帅升帐，抽调了大批人力、车辆、肥料和工具支援农业生产的需要，掀起了全民为粮而战的高潮；另一方面在农业生产的各个季节，提出了明确而响亮的口号，批判和克服了各个时期不利于生产的消极思想和情绪。
    人民公社化，给柴达木农业的大发展，开辟了广阔的道路。人民公社使牧业区原来分散、游牧的生产和生活方式得到了彻底改变。很多牧民定居下来以后，在“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针下，从事农业生产，垦荒造田。由于人民公社人多力量大，底子厚，因而也就能够兴办大型水利等等事业。公社化后，全区扩大农田灌溉面积十一万九千五百多亩。特别是因为柴达木地区的人民公社大都是农牧结合，在运输力和肥料上都可以直接得到牧业的支援，使人民公社的农业“如虎添翼”，发展更快。全区二十二个人民公社，到1959年已有十四个公社达到了粮食自给。过去牧业区那种粮食长期依赖外援的情况，已经开始改变。
    贯彻执行“八字宪法”
    适应高寒地区特点，因时、因地、因作物制宜地全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”，是柴达木粮食大丰收的基本原因。
    要在柴达木种出粮食来，面临的第一个问题，就是盐碱地的改良问题。在盐碱地上种粮食，在过去的“科学”规程上，一直是一个难题。按照以前的“科学根据”，含碱千分之三以上的土地，农作物是根本无法生长的。然而，在党领导下的柴达木农业职工，鄙弃了这种偏见，破除迷信，解放思想，在含碱80％以上的土地上种出了粮食，并且获得了大丰收。几年来，全区在“边改良、边利用，通过实践，找出经验，总结推广”的原则指导下，改良了大量盐碱地。格尔木农场全部为盐碱地，在第一年播种小麦时，每亩产量只有十三斤半。但经过逐步摸索和顽强试验，终于征服了盐碱地。1959年这个农场在五千零八十一亩土地上，创造了亩产三百五十三斤的丰产纪录。柴达木改良盐碱地成功并获得粮食高产的事实，又一次表明了“人定胜天”的真理。
    全区各农场、公社和农业领导部门，还根据柴达木地区的特点，“顺天时，应地利”，合理而有效的运用了农业“八字宪法”，充分发挥了柴达木肥源多、日照长、水源足（冰川储水量大，全区均为水浇地）、风力大（适宜密植）、气温适宜（昼夜温差大、对农作物生长适宜）、气候干燥（病虫害不易孳生、蔓延）、土质较好等有利条件，避免和克服了地势高寒、无霜期短的不利条件，战胜了霜冻、冰雹等自然灾害。各公社、农场早在1958年冬天就大搞水利，破冰引水，修筑水库、水渠、涝池和挖井、挖泉等工作，使全部土地浇上了水。备耕期间，各农场、公社又抓住了肥源多的特点，开辟了百种以上肥源，就地取材大建小型化肥厂，每亩地平均施基肥两万多斤，比1958年增加了两倍多。为了充分发挥处女地的地力，各场、社还在积肥的同时，大闹深翻，一般田都翻了三十厘米，丰产田翻了四十厘米到六十厘米左右。各场、社为保证粮食大面积增产，还在深翻、多肥的前提下，根据盆地多风的特点，注意了合理密植。1959年春小麦每亩一般下种四十斤，保苗四十五万株以上。鉴于盆地地势高寒，全区还普遍选用了南大二四一九、碧玉麦等适应性强、耐寒力大的良种，并进行了赛力散和六六六药剂处理。在田间管理上，各场、社除紧紧扣住各个环节细致操作以外，并在大块丰产田中，普遍实现了园田化。
    柴达木农业的发展，粮食的大丰收，为工业建设的大踏步前进建立了“后勤基地”，为工业的高速度发展准备了物质基础；同时，也为农业科学的研究工作，提供了大量的可贵的实践经验和资料。
    目前，柴达木各级党委，农垦领导部门，各农场、公社，以及有关农业科学技术研究机构，都在系统地总结已有经验，借以指导1960年和今后的农业生产。广大职工和农牧民群众，正在大闹垦荒，大兴水利，大抓深翻积肥，掀起了一个更大规模的冬季生产高潮，为夺取1960年的粮食丰收而战斗！
