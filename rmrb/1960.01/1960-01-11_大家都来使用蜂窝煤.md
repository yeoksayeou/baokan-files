    Everyone Should Use Honeycomb Coal Briquettes

    Saving household coal is an important aspect of the entire coal conservation movement. While the amount of coal that can be saved by a single household may be limited, the cumulative figure becomes considerable when thousands of households conserve.

    The main way to save residential coal, in addition to strengthening political and ideological education and establishing a habit of thrift, is to seize the crucial link of promoting advanced coal-saving stoves.

    The honeycomb coal stove is a good type of stove that saves coal and is convenient. It was first promoted in Beijing. Now, almost all major cities that burn anthracite coal have this type of stove. The benefits of honeycomb coal can be summarized as: saving coal, saving firewood, saving transport capacity, saving trouble, and being clean and sanitary. According to a survey in Beijing, burning honeycomb coal saves an average of about 20% more pure coal than burning coal balls. Using honeycomb coal eliminates the need to start a fire every day, saving an average of more than half a catty of firewood per household per day. Ordinary coal balls contain 15% to 25% yellow soil, while honeycomb coal only contains about 5% lime, so it can also save a lot of transport capacity for transporting yellow soil and transporting furnace ash. Beijing calculated that if all 680,000 coal-burning households in the city switched to burning honeycomb coal, the city could save about 400,000 tons of pure coal, 150 to 200 million catties of firewood, and 450,000 tons of transport capacity per year, totaling more than 16.68 million yuan. If it is widely promoted in large and medium-sized cities across the country that burn anthracite coal, the numbers will be even greater. Burning honeycomb coal eliminates the need to light a fire every day, or to frequently add coal and remove ash, the firepower is easy to control, and it is very convenient to use. The coal pile takes up little space. Therefore, it can save a lot of time and also make it easy to keep windows clean, which is very beneficial to environmental and family hygiene.

    At present, although most large and medium-sized cities that burn anthracite coal have a different number of residents using honeycomb coal, the scope of promotion is still not very common. There are also some problems in the production and use of honeycomb coal. In order to quickly promote honeycomb coal stoves, the following issues must be paid attention to:

    First, it is necessary to resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party and fully mobilize the masses. Although honeycomb coal has many advantages and is beneficial to the country and the masses, it is, after all, a new thing for most residents. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, in conjunction with the entire coal conservation movement, extensive publicity work must be carried out. As long as the reasons are explained clearly and the advantages of honeycomb coal are explained clearly, it will definitely be supported and welcomed by the masses.

    Second, solve the problems of stoves and usage methods. Honeycomb coal stoves have a simple structure, and general coal ball stoves can be modified. In order to save materials and reduce residents' expenses, the best way is to modify existing stoves. If it is really impossible to modify them, we should study the use of ceramic stoves and mud stoves or honeycomb coal stoves made of bricks. Using this type of stove saves money, saves steel, and is easy to promote widely. Many places are already using this type of stove. For example, Beijing created ash-depositing stoves and brick stoves, Xiamen created ceramic stoves, and Tianjin created economical stoves made of refractory clay mixed with furnace ash. Although some of these stoves are not yet complete and need to be further improved, they are basically usable. As long as the stove door is well made, its effect is not much different from that of a tin stove.

    Third, based on the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, making do with whatever is available, and using local materials, make proper arrangements for the production of honeycomb coal. Beijing has done a good job in this regard. At present, nearly ten types of machines for pressing honeycomb coal have been invented, suitable for various production and operating units with different conditions. Except for the "single-disc column-type honeycomb coal machine" designed by the hoisting machinery factory, which is made of steel and requires an electric motor to drive it, most of the others are pieced together from scrap materials. They use little iron, have a simple structure, are easy to operate, and generally increase efficiency by about two times. And it greatly reduces labor intensity.

    Fourth, it is necessary to promote them according to local conditions and in a manner appropriate to local conditions. When promoting honeycomb coal, do not mechanically imitate others. For example, in some areas in the south, the stoves used are smaller, use less coal, and the local sources of firewood are not difficult to obtain, so it may not be necessary to promote honeycomb coal.

    Promoting coal conservation among residents is beneficial to both the country and individuals. As long as we explain the reasons clearly and promote honeycomb coal, we will surely be widely welcomed by the masses.

### 大家都来使用蜂窝煤

    大家都来使用蜂窝煤
    节约民用煤是整个节约用煤运动的一个重要方面。从一家一户来看，能够节省的煤炭数量虽然有限，但是千家万户都来节约，积累起来的数字就很可观了。
    节约居民用煤的主要途径，除了加强政治思想教育，树立节约风气而外，还必须抓住推广先进省煤炉灶这个重要环节。
    蜂窝煤炉就是一种既省煤又方便的好炉子。它开始是在北京市推广起来的。现在，在烧无烟煤的较大城市中差不多都有了这种炉子。蜂窝煤的好处，归纳起来就是：省煤、省柴、省运力、省事，清洁卫生。据北京市调查，烧蜂窝煤比烧煤球平均省纯煤20％左右。使用蜂窝煤不必天天生火，平均每户每天还可省劈柴半斤多。一般煤球都掺有15％至25％的黄土，而蜂窝煤只掺5％左右的石灰，所以又可节省很多运进黄土和运出炉灰的运输力。北京市算了一下账，如果全市六十八万烧煤户都改烧蜂窝煤，全年就可省纯煤四十万吨左右，省劈柴一亿五至二亿斤，省运力四十五万吨左右，总共折合人民币一千六百六十八万多元。如果全国烧无烟煤的大、中城市都普遍推广，数字就更大了。烧蜂窝煤不必天天升火，不必经常通炉加煤和掏灰，火力好控制，使用很方便，煤堆占的地方小。因而既能省出很多时间，也容易做到窗明几净，对搞好环境卫生和家庭卫生有很多好处。
    目前，大部分烧无烟煤的大、中城市，虽然都有了数量不同的居民使用蜂窝煤，但是推广的面还很不普遍，在蜂窝煤的生产和使用上也还有一些问题，为了把蜂窝煤炉很快地推广开去，必须注意以下几个问题：
    第一，要坚决依靠党的领导，充分发动群众。蜂窝煤虽然好处很多，对国家对群众都有好处，但是对大部分居民来讲，毕竟还是一个新的事物，因此必须在党的领导下，结合整个节约用煤运动，广泛地开展宣传工作。只要把道理讲清楚，把蜂窝煤的优越性讲清楚，就一定会得到群众的拥护和欢迎。
    第二，解决炉具和使用方法问题。蜂窝煤炉构造简单，一般煤球炉子都可以改制，为了节约物资和减少居民的开支，最好的办法是把现有的炉子加以改制。如果实在不能改制，应该研究使用陶瓷炉和泥瓦炉或者用砖砌成的蜂窝煤炉，使用这种炉子，既省钱又能节约钢铁，便于广泛推广。目前已有许多地方使用这种炉子，如北京市创造了泊灰炉和砖炉，厦门创造了陶瓷炉，天津创造了耐火土掺炉灰的经济炉等，这些炉具尽管其中有的还不尽完整，需要进一步改进，但是基本上可用，只要把炉门搞好，它的效果和铁皮炉子没有多大差别。
    第三，要本着土洋结合、因陋就简、就地取材的原则，妥善安排蜂窝煤的生产。北京市在这方面做得好。目前已经发明创造压制蜂窝煤的机具将近十种，适合各种不同条件的生产经营单位，其中除起重机械厂设计的“单盘柱式蜂窝煤机”是钢铁制成并需电动机带动外，其它绝大部分是废旧材料拼凑而成的，用铁不多，构造简单，便于操作，一般的能提高效率两倍左右。而且大大地减轻了劳动强度。
    第四，要根据当地具体情况因地制宜地加以推广，推广蜂窝煤，千万不能生搬硬套，比如南方有些地区，使用的炉子较小，用煤比较省，当地劈柴来源也并不困难，就不一定推广蜂窝煤。
    在居民中推行节约用煤，既有利于国家，又有利于个人，只要我们讲清道理，推广蜂窝煤，一定会得到广大群众的普遍欢迎。
