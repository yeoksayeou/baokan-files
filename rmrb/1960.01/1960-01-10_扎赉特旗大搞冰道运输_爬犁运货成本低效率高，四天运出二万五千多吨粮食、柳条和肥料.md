    Zhalait Banner Vigorously Develops Ice Road Transportation
    Sled Transportation Has Low Cost and High Efficiency, Transporting More Than 25,000 Tons of Grain, Willow Branches, and Fertilizer in Four Days
    (Our report) In order to overcome the transportation difficulties caused by winter river freezing, Zhalait Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region launched a mass movement for ice road transportation. In less than twenty days, they manufactured more than 10,000 sleds and approximately 20,000 "earth ice carts" (i.e., ice-earth sleds), and opened and repaired 240 kilometers of ice roads. In just four days, they transported more than 25,000 tons of grain, willow branches, fertilizer, and other materials. Now, the experience of Zhalait Banner is being promoted throughout the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    The experience of Zhalait Banner proves that sled transportation is simple, easy to implement, low in cost, highly efficient, and produces quick results, adapting to a variety of transportation needs. Manufacturing sleds does not require much material, and material specifications are not strict. A sled with a load capacity of less than one ton only requires 0.1 to 0.2 cubic meters of miscellaneous wood. For short-distance sleds, only one or two jin of iron nails are needed. As for the sleds used in factories and mines and in the fields, mud can be mixed with sorghum stalks, willow branches, cow dung, and grass ropes, and then frozen to make an "earth ice cart" that can carry hundreds of jin to more than a thousand jin. Since the bottom of this kind of sled is a layer of ice, it can also travel on hard soil, grassland, or field ridges, without the need for an ice road at all. The cost is also very cheap. Each sled with a load capacity of one ton only costs a dozen yuan. The construction of ice roads is also very simple. Natural ice roads only need to repair a part of the river that does not freeze or is uneven. Artificial ice roads can be built by diverting water or watering. In areas with snow cover, sleds can be used without basic processing. The freight rate for sled transportation is very cheap, only 0.15 yuan per ton-kilometer, which is about 50% lower than the freight rate for iron-wood wheeled vehicles; moreover, the efficiency is also high. A horse can pull one ton of goods for 50 kilometers a day, increasing efficiency by about three times compared with iron-wood wheeled vehicles. Because there are many types of sleds and the requirements for road conditions are not high, it can not only undertake long-distance transportation of one or two hundred kilometers, but also be applied to internal transportation in factories and mines and in the fields. It can be pulled by machinery, pushed by people, or pulled by horses. Zhalait Banner not only used sleds to transport a large number of materials, ensuring short-distance centralized transportation, but also used sleds in farmland water conservancy construction, factory material transportation, and store goods transportation.
    The reason why the mass movement of ice road transportation in Zhalait Banner can be rapidly developed is mainly due to the local Party committee strengthening its leadership over transportation work. Under the leadership of the Banner Party Committee, an ice transportation headquarters was established, with the secretary personally taking charge. Party committees at all levels also included transportation work on their agenda, making overall arrangements, unifying manpower, unifying deployment, and unifying actions. Through giving examples, carefully calculating accounts, and carrying out thorough and meticulous ideological mobilization work, the masses were made to realize the important significance of winter transportation for the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the masses were mobilized to overcome difficulties such as raw materials. When there was a shortage of wood for manufacturing sleds, the masses went up the mountains to set up camps and took materials locally to manufacture them on the spot.
    In terms of transportation management, they referred to railway transportation methods, setting up a large station every sixty li and a small station every thirty li; using the method of throwing car skins and issuing freight bills to ensure that every point is managed and every point is not chaotic.
    Recently, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held an on-site meeting on ice and snow road transportation in Zhalait Banner to promote the experience of this banner, and launched a movement to learn from and catch up with Zhalait Banner in the whole region to vigorously develop ice and snow road transportation.

    扎赉特旗大搞冰道运输
    爬犁运货成本低效率高，四天运出二万五千多吨粮食、柳条和肥料
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区扎赉特旗为了战胜冬季河道冰封带来的运输困难，开展了冰道运输的群众运动，在不到二十天的时间内，就制造了爬犁一万多张，“土冰车”（即冰土爬犁）约两万张，开辟整修冰道二百四十公里，仅仅四天时间就运出粮食、柳条、肥料等二万五千多吨。现在，扎赉特旗的经验正在内蒙古自治区全区推广。
    扎赉特旗的经验证明，爬犁运输简便易行，成本低、效率高、收效快，适应多种运输的需要。制造爬犁，用料不多，材料规格要求不严，一般载重一吨以下的爬犁只需零点一至零点二立方米的杂元木；短距离的爬犁，所需铁钉不过一、二斤，至于厂矿内和田间运输用的爬犁，可以用泥土加上秫秸、柳条、牛粪、草绳和上水，即可“冻”一张“土冰车”，能载重几百斤到一千多斤。由于这种爬犁下部是冰层，还可以在硬土、草地或田垅上行驶，根本不用冰道。造价也很便宜，每张载重一吨的爬犁，只需十几元。冰道的修造也很简便，天然冰道只要修整一部分不结冻或不平整的河道就可以了。人工冰道可以采用引水或浇水的办法修筑。在有积雪的地区，基本不加工就可以走爬犁。爬犁运输的运费很便宜，每吨公里只一角五分，比铁木轮车运费低50％左右；而且效率还高，一匹马拉一吨货可日行五十公里，比铁木轮车提高效率三倍左右。由于爬犁种类很多，行驶道路条件要求不高，所以它不仅可担任一、二百公里长距离的运输，也适用于厂矿内部和田间运输，既可以用机械牵引，又可用人推、马拉。扎赉特旗不仅用爬犁运送了大批物资，保证了短途集运，而且在农田水利建设、工厂运料、商店拉货等都用上了爬犁。
    扎赉特旗的冰道运输群众运动所以能迅速开展，主要是由于当地党委加强了对运输工作的领导。在旗委的领导下，成立了冰运指挥部，书记亲自挂帅，各级党委也把交通运输工作纳入议事日程，统筹安排，统一人力，统一部署，统一行动。并通过举实例，算细账，深入细致地进行思想发动工作，使群众认识到冬季运输对工农业生产继续跃进的重要意义，发动群众克服原材料等困难。制造爬犁缺少木材，群众就上山安营扎寨，就地取材，就地制造。
    在运输管理方面，他们参照铁路运输办法，六十华里设一大站，三十华里设一小站；运用扔车皮，开货运单的办法，做到点点有人管，点点不乱。
    最近，内蒙古自治区在扎赉特旗召开了冰雪道运输现场会议，推广这个旗的经验，在全区范围内开展起学扎旗、赶扎旗的大搞冰雪道运输运动。
