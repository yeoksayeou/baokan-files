Hoisting Winch for Going Uphill, Chute for Going Downhill, Rail Transportation for Flat Tunnels
Jianchuan Sanying Coal Mine Increases Production Sixfold

(Our dispatch) The Sanying Coal Mine in Jianchuan County, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, in its vigorous effort to increase the production of raw coal to support industrial construction, combined with the characteristics of the mine, fully mobilized the masses, and actively carried out technical innovations. It has basically eliminated the phenomenon of manual carrying and shouldering throughout the mine, realizing "hoisting winch for going uphill, chute for going downhill, and rail transportation for flat tunnels," greatly reducing the physical labor of workers, and increasing raw coal production by 6.2 times.

In the past, the entire production process of the Sanying Coal Mine relied on heavy manual labor such as carrying and shouldering, which was very inefficient. Coal mining and transportation were disconnected, affecting the increase in production. After the county party committee put forward the instruction to vigorously carry out technical innovations, eliminate manual carrying and shouldering, and increase raw coal production, some people at that time thought that increasing production would require increasing labor and machinery and equipment. Others believed that the slope of the Sanying Coal Mine was too large and could not be mechanized, and they had no confidence in carrying out technical innovations. After discovering the above ideological situation, the mine's party branch immediately launched a debate among the broad masses of workers on whether or not technical innovation could be carried out. Through the debate, the workers' understanding was improved, and their confidence in vigorously carrying out technical innovation was enhanced.

After the masses were mobilized, the party branch, based on the specific conditions of the mine, first conducted an experiment in the worst-conditioned No. 2 cave to replace manual carrying with rope hoisting of coal, which increased efficiency by more than one time. At this time, the party branch immediately called on everyone to summarize this experience, improve on it, and, according to everyone's opinions, changed to using electric wire as a cableway and installed a hand-cranked roller, which resulted in a doubling of work efficiency. This greatly stimulated the workers' confidence and enthusiasm in reforming technology, and they further proposed the opinion of trial-producing indigenous winches. After adopting the indigenous winch, work efficiency was increased by fifteen times compared to manual carrying. The workers happily said, "This time we don't have to carry it anymore, we're going to be winch drivers!" Many workers at the on-site meeting said that they would also use their brains and carry out innovations when they returned. Soon, a upsurge of proposing rationalization proposals, installing indigenous equipment, solving transportation, and increasing production was formed throughout the mine.

After the problem of lifting winches was solved, flat tunnel transportation was required to keep up. The party branch assigned this task to the workers, and wooden rails of 920 meters were laid in the flat tunnels, and the ground transportation from the wellhead to the coal storage yard was also solved accordingly. The work that used to require 300 people now only requires six people.

After the innovation of the above production links, the workers who loaded cars on the ground created loading chutes according to the terrain. Loading a car used to take one hour, but now it only takes ten minutes, and work efficiency has increased fivefold. Inspired by the loading and unloading work, downhill movement in the well has also been achieved by chutes, which has increased the work efficiency of coal extraction by four times.

In order to promote the continuous development of technical innovation and ensure that the entire production process is innovated, the party branch established a rationalization proposal research institution and a reform tool repair factory, and designated special personnel to purchase reform tools and supplies. Because the party branch of the mine relied on the masses and guided everyone to continuously innovate, the coal mining has now adopted blasting coal extraction and hand-cranked drilling, and nine indigenous winches and twenty chutes have been installed, two kilometers of wooden rails have been laid, and flat tunnel mine car transportation has been improved to increase from more than 70 cars to 600 to 800 cars per day.

    上山绞车化　下山溜槽化　平巷轨道运输化
    剑川三营煤矿产量提高六倍
    本报讯　云南大理白族自治州剑川县三营煤矿在大力增产原煤支援工业建设中，结合本矿特点，充分发动群众，积极进行技术革新，已在全矿基本上消灭了人背人挑的现象，实现了“上山绞车化、下山溜槽化、平巷轨道运输化”，大大减轻了工人的体力劳动，原煤产量提高六点二倍。
    三营煤矿过去整个生产过程都是依靠人背、人挑笨重的体力劳动，效率很低，采煤和运输脱节，影响产量的提高。在县委提出大搞技术革新，消灭人背人挑，增产原煤的指示后，当时有些人认为增产就得增加劳动力和机器设备，有的又认为三营煤矿坡度大，不能实现车子化，对搞技术革新没有信心。矿党支部在发现以上思想情况后，立即在广大职工中展开能不能搞技术革新的辩论，通过辩论，提高了职工认识，增强了大搞技术革新的必胜信心。
    当群众发动起来以后，党支部根据本矿的具体情况，首先在条件最坏的二号洞进行以绳索吊煤代替人背的试验，效率比人背提高了一倍多。这时，党支部立即召集大家总结这一经验，加以提高，并根据大家的意见改用电线做溜索，装上一个手摇滚筒，结果又提高了工效一倍。这样就大大激起了工人们改革技术的信心和劲头，又进一步提出试制土绞车的意见。采用土绞车后，比人背提高工效十五倍。工人高兴的说：“这回可不用背了，咱们可要当绞车司机了！”很多工人在现场会上表示回去也要开动脑筋，搞革新。很快地在全矿就形成一个提合理化建议，安装土设备，解决运输，提高生产的热潮。
    提升绞车的问题解决了，就要求平巷运输跟上去。党支部就将这一课题交给工人，于是在平巷铺起九百二十米的木轨，井口到储煤场的地面运输也就随之解决。过去需三百人的工作，现在只需六个人了。
    经过上述生产环节的革新，地面装汽车的工人们根据地形创造了装车溜槽，过去装车需一小时，现在十分钟就够了，工效提高了五倍。在装卸工作的启发下，井下的下山，也实现溜槽化了，使回采工效提高了四倍。
    党支部为推进技术革新不断发展，使整个生产环节都得到革新，成立了合理化建议研究机构和一个改革工具修造厂，指定专人购备改革工具和用品。由于矿的党支部依靠群众，引导大家不断革新，目前在采煤方面已采用爆破落煤和手摇钻打眼，并安装起上土绞车九部，溜槽二十个，铺木轨二千米，平巷矿车运输经过改进后，已由每天七十多车提高到六百至八百车。（附图片）
