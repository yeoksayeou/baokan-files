	Thirtieth Anniversary of the Discovery of Peking Man Skull
	Chinese Academy of Sciences Holds Academic Conference

In late December of last year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences convened a commemorative meeting in Beijing for the thirtieth anniversary of the discovery of the first Peking Man skull. More than 140 professionals and university teachers from paleontology, geology, anthropology, archaeology, museums, and other fields from all over the country attended the commemorative meeting. Soviet archaeologist Academician Giselev also attended the meeting and delivered a speech.

A total of twenty-eight papers and reports were presented at the commemorative meeting. Some of these papers and reports were comprehensive summaries based on existing materials that had been re-studied, and some were guiding papers that deeply studied new materials. They fully reflected the fruitful achievements of China's paleoanthropology under the leadership of the Party, especially the promotion of the great leap forward in the national economy to the great leap forward in paleoanthropology.

Professor Pei Wenzhong, who discovered the first "Peking Man" skull at Zhoukoudian thirty years ago, gave a report at the meeting on the living environment of primitive Chinese humans, discussing the paleogeography and paleoclimate of various periods of the Quaternary, and then deduced the living environment of ancient humans. Anthropologist Professor Wu Dingliang reported on the study of the glabella prominence of Ape-man, ancient man, new man and modern man, and explored the law of change of the glabella prominence.

Professor Wu Rukang, in his report "The Imbalance of the Physical Development of Chinese Ape-man and Its Significance to the Theory of 'Labor Creates Man'," proved the correctness of the theory that labor created man. He said that from the results of the study of Chinese Ape-man fossils, it can be clearly seen that the upper limb bones of Chinese Ape-man are extremely similar to those of modern humans, while the skull is more primitive than that of modern humans, and the brain volume is far below that of modern humans. This proves that Engels' theory of "from ape to man" is completely correct.

Professor Jia Lanbo conducted research based on the stone tools discovered from Chinese Ape-man and the red soil layer in Shanxi, and made a detailed division of the strata in which the stone tools were found. He pointed out that although there are still some missing links in the development of the entire Stone Age culture, the existing materials have shown the continuity between each other. This continuity can explain that the primitive culture of the motherland is complete and flawless, and we can trace the history of the motherland back to 500,000 years ago.

Comrade Wu Xinzhi criticized Weidenreich's claim that the Upper Cave Man belonged to different races in his "The Racial Issue of the Upper Cave Man". This research has great academic significance.

The meeting determined the task of "striving to ascertain the basic situation of human fossils and Paleolithic in major areas of our country before 1962."

### 中国猿人头骨发现三十周年  中国科学院举行学术会议

    中国猿人头骨发现三十周年
    中国科学院举行学术会议
    去年12月下旬，中国科学院在北京召开了中国猿人第一个头盖骨发现三十周年纪念会。参加纪念会的有来自全国各地的古生物、地质、人类学、考古、博物馆等专业工作者和高等院校教师共一百四十余人。苏联考古学家吉谢列夫通讯院士也出席了会议并作了讲话。
    在纪念会上共提出了论文和报告二十八篇。这些论文和报告有的是在既有材料基础上重新加以研究的综合性总结，有的是对新材料深入研究的指导性的论文。它们充分反映了我国古人类学在党的领导下取得的丰硕成果，特别是国民经济大跃进对古人类学大跃进的推动作用。
    三十年前在周口店发现“中国猿人”第一个头盖骨的裴文中教授在会上作了中国原始人类的生活环境的报告，探讨了第四纪各个时期的古地理、古气候，进而推论了古人类的生活环境。人类学家吴定良教授报告了有关猿人、古人、新人及现代人眉间凸度的研究，探讨了眉间凸度的变化规律。
    吴汝康教授在他的“中国，猿人体质发展的不平衡性及其对‘劳动创造人类’理论的意义”的报告中，证明劳动创造了人类的理论的正确性。他说，从对中国猿人化石进行研究的结果，可以明显看出中国猿人的上肢骨与现代人极为相似，而头骨则较现代人为原始，脑量也远在现代人之下。这就证明了恩格斯的“从猿到人”的理论是完全正确的。
    贾兰波教授根据对中国猿人和山西红色土层中发现的石器进行了研究，并把发现石器的地层作了详细的划分。他指出，尽管在整个的石器文化的发展上还存在着一些缺环，但是目前已有的材料已显示出彼此之间的连续性，这种连续性可以说明祖国的原始文化是完整无缺的，我们可以把祖国历史一直追溯到五十万年以前。
    吴新智同志在他的“山顶洞人的种族问题”中，批判了魏敦瑞关于山顶洞人属于不同种族的说法。这一研究具有很大的学术意义。
    会议确定了“争取在1962年以前摸清我国主要地区的人类化石和旧石器的基本情况”的任务。
