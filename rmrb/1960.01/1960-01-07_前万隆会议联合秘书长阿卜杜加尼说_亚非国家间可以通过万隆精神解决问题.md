Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd, Jakarta Message: Abdoelgani, Deputy Chairman of the Indonesian Provisional Supreme Advisory Council, said in response to a question from an Antara News Agency reporter regarding the prospects for Asian-African solidarity in the new year of 1960, that people should not lose confidence in their ability to solve problems through the spirit of the Bandung Conference due to the current tensions between Asian countries.

Abdoelgani once served as Secretary-General of the Joint Secretariat of the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung. He said he believed that Asian-African solidarity would not disappear in 1960. He said that indeed, sometimes tensions do arise, but those who have watched the discussions and debates during the Bandung Conference in 1955 would certainly not underestimate the true significance of Asian-African nationalism.

He said that as long as we fully understand the content and essence of Asian-African nationalism, we will not fall into the trap of those who hope to hinder the growth and development of this spirit of solidarity. It is even more impossible to fall into the trap of those international reactionary groups who hope that Asians will fight Asians.

When asked whether the recently emerged tensions were obstacles and whether they could be resolved according to the Bandung spirit, he replied, "Every wave has its ups and downs," but "downs" are precisely a necessary condition for the next "ups." Abdoelgani believes that in 1958 and 1959, Asia regressed, but at the same time, Africa saw a dynamic and energetic rising tide of solidarity. The second half of the twentieth century will continue to be inspired by Asian-African solidarity.

    前万隆会议联合秘书长阿卜杜加尼说
    亚非国家间可以通过万隆精神解决问题
    新华社3日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚临时最高谘询委员会副主席阿卜杜加尼在回答安塔拉通讯社记者关于在1960年新的一年中亚非团结的前景时说，人们不应当由于目前亚洲国家间存在的紧张情况而丧失他们可以通过万隆会议精神解决问题的信心。
    阿卜杜加尼曾经担任在万隆举行的亚非会议联合秘书处秘书长。他说，他相信，亚非的团结在1960年不会消逝。他说，的确，有时真的发生了一些紧张情况，但是曾经注视1955年万隆会议期间的讨论和辩论的人肯定不会轻视亚非民族主义的真正意义。
    他说，只要我们充分知道亚非民族主义的内容和实质的意义，我们就不会陷入希望妨碍这种团结精神的成长和发展的圈套。更不可能陷入希望亚洲人打亚洲人的那些国际反动集团的圈套。
    有人问他，最近出现的紧张情况是不是障碍，它们是否会根据万隆精神加以解决。他回答说，“每个波浪都有其起伏”，但是，“伏”恰好是下一个“起”的必要条件。阿卜杜加尼认为，1958和1959年，亚洲有退步，但是，同时在非洲有了充满活力和动力的日益高涨的团结浪潮。二十世纪的下半世纪将仍然得到亚非团结的鼓舞。
