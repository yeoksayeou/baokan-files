Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: The technical level of China's machinery industry is rapidly improving. At present, the national machinery industry system has made many significant advances in product design, manufacturing technology, and the realization of mechanization and automation, thereby ensuring the production of various machinery and equipment in greater quantities, faster, better, and more economically, meeting the needs of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy. The First Ministry of Machine Building is strengthening its leadership in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, formulating measures, vigorously mobilizing the masses, and promoting these effective experiences.

In terms of product design, the design personnel of the machinery industry system have not only created many new and efficient product designs but also made many major reforms to the structure of old products, thereby improving product performance and greatly saving materials and man-hours. For example, the 50,000-kilowatt hydrogen-cooled turbo generator, which was independently designed and successfully trial-produced in China last year, can generate 328,000 more kilowatt-hours of electricity per year than a similarly sized air-cooled turbo generator, and its service life can also be extended. The original design of the Jiefang truck was 3.9 tons in weight and 4 tons in load capacity. After the efforts of the workers of the First Automobile Factory, the current weight is 3.5 tons, and the load capacity can reach 5 tons, with actual performance exceeding that of the American Dodge truck. The multi-wire rope winch can save half of the processing time and more than two-thirds of the materials compared to the ordinary drum winch with the same capacity. The anvil-less forging hammer does not have a base, does not require a foundation, and the upper and lower hammerheads move together without vibration. The equipment's own weight is greatly reduced, which can save a lot of processing time and materials. Replacing ordinary forging hammers with this kind of hammer has become the technical development direction of forging equipment.

In terms of adopting new technologies, there has been further development in both hot and cold processing. For example, advanced technologies such as mud molding, ductile iron, shell molding, carbon dioxide water glass sand molding, die-casting, and hydraulic sand cleaning in casting technology have been newly developed, which have played a significant role in improving work efficiency. China's traditional casting technology—mud molding—has developed from casting iron to casting steel after its promotion in 1959, and from casting general small and medium-sized parts to casting large parts weighing 28 tons. Casting with "mud molds" can now be done dozens of times with one mold, which can improve production efficiency by several times or even dozens of times compared to "sand molds," which can only be used once per mold. After the forging process promoted cast steel surfacing forging dies, it was already possible to manufacture large forging dies for 10-ton forging hammers last year. Die forging can greatly improve production efficiency and product quality compared to free forging. In the past, the difficulty in manufacturing forging dies, especially large forging dies, affected the widespread application of this advanced technology. The promotion of cast steel surfacing forging dies has accelerated the process of forging workers' transition from free forging to die forging. Various new welding technologies, such as electroslag welding, are now also being used more widely. Many large components in the large rolling steel, power generation, and forging equipment produced last year were made using this ingenious "piecing together small parts into large parts" welding method. In terms of cold processing, many modern processing technologies have also been adopted in various places. The most prominent of these are: highly efficient processes such as punching, pressing, extrusion, drawing, and rolling without cutting; various electrical processing techniques that can manufacture complex molds or parts; as well as high-speed cutting, strong cutting, and the more extensive use of cemented carbide. The "ants gnawing at bones" processing technology, created by the masses in 1958 to use small machine tools to do big jobs, has also been further developed last year. Many sets of large rolling mills were manufactured last year because most of the factories undertaking rolling mill tasks adopted this method when processing large components and parts. After more than a year of practice, the technical level of "ants gnawing at bones" has also improved, and it has now changed from special-purpose to general-purpose, from manual feed to automatic feed, from single-edge cutting to multi-edge cutting, and from one or several "ants" working to a large "ant formation," improving the adaptability and work efficiency of processing.

After the National Conference of Heroes, the mechanization and automation movement in the machinery industry system progressed very rapidly. Large-scale mechanization and automation in large enterprises broke the erroneous view of some people in the past that modern enterprises could not engage in technical innovation, and opened up a path for modern enterprises to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. Many large enterprises reformed and reorganized individual automated machines or mechanized equipment, and added conveying belts and other devices to connect them into a group of automated continuous production machines. For example, the workers of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory connected the machines for processing "hand taps" with automatic conveyor belts to form an "automatic cold processing line for taps." In this way, the operation by seven workers per shift was reduced to operation by two workers, the output of taps increased by more than seven times, and labor productivity increased by twelve times. In the mechanization and automation movement, the blind faith of some factories with relatively poor equipment in automatic production lines was also eliminated. Many enterprises used waste materials and modified and remanufactured methods to create high-efficiency mechanized equipment and automatic production lines, which achieved remarkable results and immediate results after being put into production. For example, the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant's iron casting workshop used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods and made simple and crude arrangements to gradually connect the various processes, starting from single-process mechanization, and built an "easy mechanized production line for small and medium-sized castings" with complete mechanization of the entire production process from modeling, transportation, pouring, to box removal, sand loading, and sand return. Production efficiency jumped three times, production area decreased by 73%, output per unit area increased by one time, and personnel decreased by 76%.

In 1959, many enterprises vigorously carried out tool innovation campaigns, widely adopted high-efficiency cutting tools, abrasives, molds, fixtures, and gauges, and realized mechanization of fitter operations. At the same time, assembly line operations were established in terms of production organization. All of these have played a significant role in continuously improving labor productivity.

    机械工业新技术大丰收
    产品设计推陈出新　先进工艺广泛推行
    机械化自动化运动进展快　工具革新成效大
    新华社13日讯　我国机械工业的技术水平正在飞跃地提高。目前，全国机械工业系统在产品设计、制造工艺、实现机械化自动化等方面，都有许多重大的进步，从而保证了多、快、好、省地生产各种机器设备，满足国民经济大跃进的需要。第一机械工业部正在加强对技术革新和技术革命运动的领导，制订措施，大力发动群众，推广这些行之有效的经验。
    在产品设计方面，机械工业系统的设计人员不但作出了不少新的、高效率的产品设计；对老产品的结构，也作了许多重大的改革，因而提高了产品性能，大大节约了材料和工时。例如我国自行设计并在去年试制成功的五万瓩氢冷却汽轮发电机，比同样大的、用空气冷却的汽轮发电机，每年可以多发出三十二万八千多度电，使用寿命还能延长。解放牌汽车原来的设计是自重三点九吨，载重四吨，经过第一汽车厂职工努力改进，现在自重三吨半，载重量可以达到五吨，实际使用效能超过了美国道奇牌汽车。多钢丝绳式卷扬机比同样能力的普通卷筒式卷扬机，加工工时可以节约一半，材料可以节约三分之二以上。无砧座锻锤因为没有底座，不用打地基，上下锤头一起动，没有震动，设备自重大大减轻，可以节约大量的加工工时和材料，用这种锤代替普通锻锤，成为锻压设备的技术发展方向。
    在采用新工艺方面，不论热加工和冷加工，有了进一步的发展。如铸造工艺中的泥型铸造、球墨铸铁、壳模铸造、二氧化碳水玻璃砂型、压力铸造和水力清砂等先进工艺都有了新的发展，对提高工作效率起了很大作用。我国的传统铸造技术——泥型铸造，在1959年推广以后，已经由铸铁发展到铸钢，由铸一般中小件发展到能铸二十八吨重的大件。用“泥型”浇注，已能做到一模浇几十次，比用一模只能浇一次的“砂型”生产效率可以提高几倍甚至几十倍。锻工工艺推广了铸钢堆焊锻模后，去年已经能够制造十吨锻锤上用的大锻模了。模锻比自由锻造，能大大提高生产效率和产品质量；过去由于锻模，特别是大型锻模制造困难，便影响了这种先进工艺的广泛应用。铸钢堆焊锻模的推广，加速了锻工从自由锻向模锻发展的过程。各种新的焊接技术例如电渣焊等，现在也有了更广泛的应用。去年生产的大型轧钢、发电、锻压设备当中，有好多大部件是这种“拼小成大”的巧妙的焊接办法做出来的。冷加工方面，各地也采用了许多现代化的加工工艺。其中最突出的有：效率很高的冲、压、挤、拨、轧等无切削加工工艺，能制造形状复杂的模具或零件的各种电加工工艺；以及高速切削、强力切削、更广泛地使用硬质合金等等。1958年群众创造的用小机床干大活的“蚂蚁啃骨头”加工工艺，在去年也有了进一步的发展。去年能够制造出许多套大型轧钢机，都是由于大多数承担轧机任务的工厂在加工大部件、零件时，采用了这种办法。经过一年多的实践，“蚂蚁啃骨头”的技术水平也有了提高，现在已由专用改为通用，由手工进刀改为自动进刀，由单刀切削改为多刀切削，由一个或几个“蚂蚁”工作改为大摆“蚂蚁阵”，加工的适应性和工作效率都提高了。
    全国群英会以后，机械工业系统中的机械化自动化运动进展十分迅速。大企业中大搞机械化自动化，打破了一部分人过去认为现代化企业不能搞技术革新的错误观点，为现代化企业开展技术革新和技术革命开辟了一条道路。许多大型企业将单个的自动化机械或机械化设备加以改革改组，并且增加传送带等装置，使之连成一组自动化连续生产的机器群。如哈尔滨量具刃具厂职工，将加工“手用丝锥”的机器，用自动传送带把它们联结成一条“丝锥冷加工自动线”。这样，每班可由七个工人操作减少到用两个工人操作，丝锥的产量提高了七倍多，劳动生产率提高了十二倍。在机械化自动化运动中，也破除了一些设备比较差的工厂对自动生产线的迷信，不少企业用废旧材料和改装改制办法创造了高效率的机械化装备和自动生产线，投入生产后，成绩卓著，立竿见影。例如，齐齐哈尔车辆厂铸铁车间用土洋结合、因陋就简的办法，从单工序机械化开始，把各个工序逐步衔接起来，建成从造型、运送、浇注到打箱、上砂、回砂整个生产过程全部机械化的“中小型铸件简易机械化生产线”，生产效率猛跃三倍，生产面积减少73％，单位面积产量提高一倍，人员减少76％。
    1959年，许多企业大力开展工具革新运动，广泛采用了高效率的刀具、磨具、模具、夹具、量具，实现钳工操作机械化。同时，在生产组织方面建立了流水作业线。这些，都对不断提高劳动生产率起了很大的作用。
