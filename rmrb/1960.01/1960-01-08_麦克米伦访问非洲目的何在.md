    What is Macmillan's Purpose in Visiting Africa?
    British Prime Minister Begins African Visit
    Indicates British Government's Unease About the Situation in Africa
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: British Prime Minister Macmillan began his six-week visit to Africa on the 5th.
    On the 6th, Macmillan arrived in Accra, the capital of Ghana. He is scheduled to stay in Accra for six days.
    That evening, he held talks with Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah. An official statement issued after the meeting said that they discussed Ghana's Volta River Delta project and the overall situation in Africa.
    Upon arriving in Accra, Macmillan stated that he was in Ghana to "see, listen, and learn."
    Ghana's Minister of Education and Information, Bako, said at a press conference on the evening of the 6th that he hoped Macmillan would "see" how Ghana had done more in three years than Britain had done in over a hundred years of rule, and hoped he would "learn" that there was no racial discrimination in Ghana. He also hoped that Macmillan would compare this situation with the Union of South Africa, which he will be visiting.
    Bako called on Britain to grant independence to all its territories in Africa, "so that they all feel like equal members of a club."
    Macmillan is scheduled to visit Ghana and Nigeria in West Africa, Rhodesia and Nyasaland in Central Africa, the Union of South Africa, and the British colonies of Bechuanaland, Basutoland, and Swaziland in South Africa.
    Macmillan will be the first British Prime Minister in history to visit Africa. Before his visit, British Colonial Secretary Macleod visited East Africa last month. A month after Macmillan's visit, a "survey" committee led by Monckton, initiated by the British government, will also visit Central Africa. This series of activities shows that the British government is increasingly uneasy about the surging national independence movement on the African continent.

    "Ghanaian Times" Publishes Commentary
    Macmillan Must Respect African Opinions
    Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 7th: The "Ghanaian Times" published an editorial on the 6th regarding British Prime Minister Macmillan's visit to Ghana that day, stating that Africans "resolutely oppose imperialism, colonialism, and racial discrimination. Mr. Macmillan will undoubtedly discover this fact for himself in the coming weeks."
    The editorial stated that the era when African opinions did not count "is gone forever." It said, "In this era, it is extremely foolish to disregard or ignore the opinions expressed by the mandated leaders or representatives of the African masses." The editorial pointed out that Macmillan must respect African opinions. The editorial pointed out that the atrocities committed by the British in Central Africa, as exposed by the Devlin Committee report, have "disgraced Britain." The persecution of Nyasaland African National Congress President Banda and his colleagues is "a disgrace" to Britain.

    Lebanese "Al-Nida" Publishes Article Pointing Out
    Macmillan's Visit to Africa is an Attempt to Preserve British Strongholds in Africa
    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 6th: The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Nida" published an article today commenting on British Prime Minister Macmillan's trip to Africa, saying that Macmillan is not going to Africa to hunt or vacation, but to "preserve the strongholds of British imperialism in African countries, mainly those African countries that will gain independence."
    The article said that Africans, whom imperialism calls "slaves," are igniting the flames of national liberation movements at the feet of imperialism, thoroughly shaking the pillars of imperialist rule. The newspaper then pointed out, "This is the reason why representatives of monopoly capital and envoys of imperialist countries frequently visit the African continent. This is also what drives the British Prime Minister to Africa with a briefcase filled with 'new' plans to face the difficulties of this trip."
    When discussing the new conspiracies of the imperialists to suppress the African national liberation movement, the newspaper pointed out that the imperialists have found that the means of terror and suppression they have consistently used to subjugate the African people and suppress the African national liberation movement are no longer effective. Therefore, they are changing their tactics and adopting new strategies to achieve the same goal.

### 麦克米伦访问非洲目的何在

    麦克米伦访问非洲目的何在
    英国首相开始访问非洲活动
    表明英国政府对非洲局势感到不安
    据新华社讯　英国首相麦克米伦5日开始他对非洲的为时六星期的访问。
    6日，麦克米伦到达加纳首都阿克拉。他预定在阿克拉停留六天。
    当天晚上，他同加纳总理恩克鲁玛举行了会谈。会谈后发表的官方声明说，他们讨论了加纳的沃尔特河三角洲工程计划和非洲总的情况。
    麦克米伦在到达阿克拉后曾经发表谈话说，他是到加纳“看、听和学习”的。
    加纳教育与新闻部长巴科在6日晚举行的记者招待会上说，他希望麦克米伦将“看”到加纳如何在三年内比英国统治一百多年时期做更多的事，希望他“学习”的是在加纳没有种族歧视。他还希望麦克米伦把这种情况同他将访问的南非联邦作比较。
    巴科要求英国给予它在非洲的所有领地独立，“使它们都觉得是一个俱乐部的平等成员”。
    麦克米伦预定访问的地方包括：西非的加纳和尼日利亚，中非的罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰，南非联邦以及英国在南非的殖民地贝专纳、巴苏陀兰、斯威士兰。
    麦克米伦将是历史上第一个访问非洲的英国首相。在他去访问之前，英国殖民大臣麦克劳德曾在上月访问了东非。在麦克米伦访问之后一个月，由英国政府发起的一个由蒙克顿率领的“调查”委员会也将访问中非。这一系列活动说明英国政府对于非洲大陆汹涌澎湃的民族独立运动愈来愈感到不安。
    “加纳时报”发表评论说
    麦克米伦必须尊重非洲人的意见
    据新华社7日讯　阿克拉消息：“加纳时报”6日就英国首相麦克米伦在当天到达加纳访问一事发表的社论说，非洲人“断然反对帝国主义、殖民主义和种族歧视。麦克米伦先生无疑会在今后几周里亲自发现这个事实”。
    社论说，非洲人的意见不算数的时代“已经一去不复返了”。它说，“在这个纪元里，如果轻视或者不理会非洲群众的委任领袖或代表所表示的意见，这是极其愚蠢的。”社论指出，麦克米伦必须尊重非洲人的意见。社论指出，德夫林委员会报告所暴露出来的英国在中非的暴行已使“英国名誉扫地”。尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席班达和他的同僚们所受的迫害对于英国来说是“一种耻辱”。
    黎巴嫩“呼声报”发表文章指出
    麦克米伦访非是企图保留英国在非洲的据点
    据新华社贝鲁特6日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”今天发表文章，评论英国首相麦克米伦的非洲之行说，麦克米伦不是到非洲去打猎，或者去度假，而是去“为英帝国主义保留在非洲国家的据点，主要是那些将取得独立的非洲国家”。
    文章说，被帝国主义称为“奴隶”的非洲人正在帝国主义脚下燃起民族解放运动的火焰，彻底动摇了帝国主义统治的支柱。这家报纸接着指出，“这就是垄断资本的代表和帝国主义国家的使者经常访问非洲大陆的原因。这也就使英国首相拿着装了‘新’计划的公文包到非洲去面对这次行程中的困难。”
    这家报纸在谈到帝国主义者制止非洲民族解放运动的新阴谋时指出，帝国主义者发现他们一贯使用的使非洲人民屈服和镇压非洲民族解放运动的恐怖和镇压手段已不再有效，因此，他们改头换面地采取新的策略来达到同一目的。
