Carefully Select Superior Seeds, Strong Mothers and Fat Offspring

(Our report) To further the continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960, Duchang County, Jiangxi Province, has recently launched a major inspection of seeds, focusing on early, mid, and late-season rice, cotton, soybeans, and other spring-sown crops.

When the Duchang County Party Committee inspected the preparations for spring plowing, it found that after some communes had selected seeds, they had not been promptly sun-dried and stored, and lacked dedicated management, resulting in mixing, mildew, rodent damage, and insect infestation.

In response to the above situation, the County Party Committee organized more than 500 people to conduct a comprehensive inspection team by team, warehouse by warehouse, and variety by variety. Each commune established seed inspection teams and adopted the method of "inspecting, reviewing, accepting, and sealing into warehouses for record-keeping simultaneously." During the inspection, if a shortage of seeds was discovered, communes and teams were mobilized to exchange seeds for grain, provide mutual support, and swap and adjust among themselves.

Currently, the county has prepared more than 8.8 million catties of early rice seeds, nearly 3 million catties of late rice seeds, more than 900,000 catties of mid-season long-grain indica rice seeds, more than 2 million catties of cotton seeds, and more than 3 million catties of other seeds. In addition to ensuring self-sufficiency, it also has a certain amount of early rice seeds to support other areas. (Attached picture)

    精选良种　母壮儿肥
    本报讯为了1960年农业生产的继续跃进，江西省都昌县最近开展了以早中晚稻、棉花、大豆等春播作物种子为中心的种子大检查。
    中共都昌县委在检查春耕准备工作的时候，发现有的公社种子选过以后，未及时风晒入库，缺乏专人管理，因而出现了混杂、霉烂、鼠食、虫害等现象。
    针对上述情况，县委组织了五百多人逐队、逐仓、逐品种的开展了全面大检查。各公社成立了种子检查组，采取“边检查、边审核、边验收、边入库封仓定案”的办法，在检查中发现种子不足，就发动社、队之间的以粮换种、互相支援、串换调剂。
    现在，全县已备好早稻种八百八十多万斤，晚稻种近三百万斤，中稻长粒籼种九十多万斤，棉种二百多万斤，其他种子三百余万斤，除保证自给外，并有一定数量的早稻种子支援外地。（附图片）
