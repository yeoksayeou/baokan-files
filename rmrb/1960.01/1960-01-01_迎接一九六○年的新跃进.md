    Welcoming the New Leap Forward of 1960

     I
    Under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose Right deviation and encourage greater effort, and through the efforts of the people of the whole country, the national economic plan for 1959 has been overfulfilled. According to preliminary statistical materials, in terms of industry, the main targets for 1959 proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session and adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress have been overfulfilled. The total industrial output value greatly exceeded the target of a 25.6 percent increase over 1958 proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session. Steel production exceeded the planned target of 12 million tons, reaching more than 13 million tons, and coal production also significantly exceeded the planned target of 335 million tons. In 1959, China's agriculture encountered severe natural disasters unseen in decades, with affected areas reaching more than 600 million mu, accounting for more than one-third of the total cultivated area. However, we still achieved remarkable successes on the agricultural front, and the total agricultural output value greatly exceeded the planned target. The capital construction in 1959 also completed the estimated total investment. Thus, following the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we achieved a continued Great Leap Forward in the national economy in 1959.
    The Great Leap Forward of 1959 was still a comprehensive leap forward, and a better one. Every department and every region saw great development in socialist construction. In industry, the variety of products increased greatly, the quality improved significantly, and costs were reduced considerably. Taking small-scale blast furnaces as an example, in October 1959, the equipment utilization coefficient reached an average daily output of about 0.9 tons per cubic meter, the qualification rate of pig iron reached about 80 percent, and the cost was reduced by about 40 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 1958. In agriculture, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery have achieved comprehensive development in combination with each other, and grain, cotton, oil crops, hemp, tea, tobacco, sugar crops, silkworm cocoons, fruits, vegetables, medicinal materials, and miscellaneous agricultural crops have all increased production without exception. On the basis of the comprehensive and better development of industrial and agricultural production, the transportation industry has achieved a higher rate of development than other sectors, and the market presents a new scene of prosperity.
    After the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, the situation of high-speed and proportionate leap forward in the development of the national economy, which began in 1958, has been completely established in our country.
    The continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 enabled us to complete the main targets of the original Second Five-Year Plan within two years. The "Proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" adopted by the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party in September 1956 required that the total industrial output value in 1962 should increase by about 100 percent compared with 1957, and the total agricultural output value should increase by about 30 percent. It required that by 1962, steel production should reach 10.5 million to 12 million tons, coal production should reach 190 million to 210 million tons, electricity generation should reach 40 billion to 43 billion kilowatt-hours, machine tool production should reach 60,000 to 65,000 units, cotton yarn production should reach 8 million to 9 million bales, grain production should reach about 500 billion jin, and cotton production should reach about 48 million dan. The above main targets have all been completed or overfulfilled in 1959. In this way, we can greatly increase the original targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in the next three years, and can free up more resources to strengthen some weak links in the national economy, so that China's socialist construction can continue to develop at a high speed and proportionally.
    Due to the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan, China has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization; after the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, this preliminary foundation has been further strengthened. In these two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, the output of almost all heavy industrial products has increased by more than 100 percent. Except for Tibet, all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China have established steel, machinery, and other heavy and light industries. A complete national industrial system centered on steel and machinery, combined with large, medium, and small enterprises, and with a relatively reasonable regional distribution, is rapidly taking shape; the uneven development of various regions is gradually changing. In 1958, the self-sufficiency rate of steel and machinery equipment in China had reached 80 percent, and in 1959 there was further improvement. Under the encouragement of the slogan of technological revolution, all enterprises have improved their technical level and expanded their technical teams. We have been able to design and build relatively complex modern enterprises ourselves. At the same time, the people's commune has become the basic-level organization in the vast rural areas of our country. It is the best organizational form that mobilizes more than 500 million farmers in our country to actively participate in socialist construction, combining politics and economy, and it has opened up the broadest path for the rapid development of agriculture and the rapid development of industry and other economic and cultural undertakings in rural areas. After a year of rectification and development, its superiority has become even more apparent.
    When we announced the Second Five-Year Plan in 1956, and when we adjusted the plan targets for that year in the summer of 1959, the imperialists spread lies and made all kinds of noises to attack China, attempting to confuse the public in front of the people of all countries in the world. But the development of history ruthlessly shattered the lies and noises of the imperialists.
    We used two years to complete what we originally thought would take five years to complete. This fact irrefutably proves that the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, as well as a series of related policies, is a line that combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of China's construction, and is completely in line with the objective laws of China's economy. The great practice of the past two years has enabled us to accumulate rich experience from continuous and huge victories, and also to gain valuable experience from some temporary, individual, and partial difficulties and twists and turns. People know that any new and great cause will inevitably encounter some difficulties and twists and turns in the process of development, and will always be able to overcome difficulties and move forward continuously. The experience in all aspects of the Great Leap Forward has armed our vast number of cadres and the people of the whole country. With such experience, we can deeply understand and more consciously implement the Party's general line, and can also give greater play to our initiative and creativity in socialist construction. With the material and technical conditions created by the two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward mentioned above, and with the political and ideological conditions created by the deep roots of the Party's general line in the hearts of the people, it is certain that the leap forward situation can continue to develop.
    II
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "China has a population of more than 500 million engaged in agriculture, and the condition of the peasants has a great bearing on the development of our economy and the consolidation of our political power." He also said: "The question of the road to industrialization mainly refers to the relationship between the development of heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture. It must be affirmed that our economic construction is centered on heavy industry. But at the same time, we must pay full attention to the development of agriculture and light industry."① The most prominent achievement of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years is that our Party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, has formulated a general line for correctly resolving the relationship between the development of heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture, that is, our Party has found a road that has been tested in practice and proven to be completely correct for realizing socialist industrialization in China.
    The peasant issue and the agricultural issue are of paramount importance, whether in China's democratic revolution or in the socialist revolution. Years of experience in socialist construction, especially the experience of the past two years, have repeatedly proved that if our agriculture develops, all our economic work will be easier to handle. Not only light industry will be easier to handle, but also heavy industry. Accelerating the development of agriculture is the central link in developing China's socialist economy at a high speed and proportionally.
    Comrade Mao Zedong has for many years expounded the extremely important role of agriculture in the development of the national economy. In his report "On Coalition Government" in 1945, he said: "The peasants—these are the workers in embryo. In the future, tens of millions more peasants will enter the cities and factories. If China needs to build a powerful national industry and construct many modern big cities, there must be a long process of transforming the rural population into an urban population." "The peasants—they form the main body of China’s market for industry. Only they can supply the most abundant food and raw materials and absorb the greatest amount of industrial products."② After the liberation of the whole country, when China's industry had been restored and was thriving, Comrade Mao Zedong immediately pointed out that the development of agricultural production must adapt to the needs of socialist industrialization. He led the revolutionary movement of agricultural collectivization of the national peasant masses. Thereafter, in his speech "On the Ten Major Relationships," Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that correctly handling the relationship between agriculture and industry is the primary issue in developing the national economy in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. Comrade Mao Zedong later summarized this idea as "Developing industry must go hand in hand with developing agriculture," and "Heavy industry should take agriculture as an important market." As everyone knows, this idea has been included as an important policy in the main points of the Party's general line for socialist construction.
    Under the guidance of such a policy, in 1958, the total industrial output value increased by 66 percent compared with 1957, and the total agricultural output value increased by 25 percent, with the increase in total industrial output value being 1.5 times that of agriculture; the total heavy industrial output value increased by 103 percent, and the total light industrial output value increased by 34 percent, with the increase in total heavy industrial output value being twice that of light industry. In 1959, the total industrial and agricultural output value and the total heavy and light industrial output value continued to increase greatly compared with 1958, but the increase in total agricultural output value was close to half of the growth rate of total industrial output value, and the distance between the growth rate of light industry and the growth rate of heavy industry was also greatly shortened. In this way, in the simultaneous leap forward of agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture has become more coordinated, and the proportional relationship between heavy industry and light industry has also become more coordinated.
    The more coordinated proportional relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry is conducive to the continued leap forward of the national economy, and also conducive to the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. China's worker-peasant alliance is an alliance that is constantly consolidated and developed under the leadership of the working class and through the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. After the liberation of the whole country, China's worker-peasant alliance has gone through two stages. The first stage was to establish the worker-peasant alliance on the basis of thoroughly implementing land reform, and the second stage was to establish the worker-peasant alliance on the basis of socialist ownership through agricultural collectivization and people's communes. Now China's worker-peasant alliance is beginning to enter the third stage, which is to be established on a new basis, that is, while continuing to develop socialist ownership, to gradually realize the technical transformation of agriculture and gradually realize the modernization of agriculture. Due to the communization of the people and the rapid development of production, the public accumulation required for expanded reproduction is greatly increasing in China's agriculture; the expansion of the scale of agricultural production and the increase in operating items have also created good conditions for the technical transformation of agriculture. At the same time, due to the continuous Great Leap Forward in heavy industry, the output of steel and machinery needed for the technical transformation of agriculture has been much more than in the past; the universal development of local industries, especially county and commune industries, can play an increasingly greater role in the technical transformation of agriculture. Under such circumstances, it is possible to gradually advance the worker-peasant alliance to a new stage, that is, the new stage of agricultural modernization.
    Some comrades believe that the rapid development of agriculture is incompatible with the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. This view is, of course, wrong. The rapid development of agriculture will not only not hinder, but will greatly promote the development of heavy industry. Comrade Mao Zedong said:
  "As everyone knows, light industry and agriculture are very closely related. Without agriculture, there would be no light industry. The point that heavy industry should take agriculture as an important market has not yet been made very clear to people. But as the technical transformation of agriculture gradually develops and agriculture becomes increasingly modernized, the machinery, fertilizers, water conservancy construction, power construction, transportation construction, civilian fuel, civilian building materials, etc. that serve agriculture will increase day by day, and the situation where heavy industry takes agriculture as an important market will be easily understood by people."③ China's agriculture is an agriculture engaged in by more than 500 million people, and it is the broadest domestic market that no country in the world can compare with, not only for light industry but also for heavy industry. With the rapid development of agricultural production and the increasing promotion of the technical transformation of agriculture, it requires heavy industry to provide a large amount of agricultural means of production every year. In the long run, China needs millions of tractors, millions of trucks, tens of millions of tons of chemical fertilizers, a large amount of electricity, fuel, building materials, and other agricultural machinery, as well as a large number of modern transportation tools. To meet this need, China's heavy industry cannot just develop several times, but must develop ten times or dozens of times. After heavy industry equips agriculture with so many agricultural means of production, the diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery can be greatly developed, the total output of China's agriculture can increase several times or dozens of times, the agricultural labor productivity can increase dozens of times or hundreds of times, and agriculture can provide extremely rich agricultural products, livestock products, forestry products, and other various industrial raw materials, and can transport hundreds of millions of laborers to industry and other undertakings.
    From this point of view, giving priority to the development of heavy industry and rapidly developing agriculture are two things that are mutually conditional, mutually combined, and mutually promoted. Only in this way can our agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry develop at a high speed, and the entire national economy can also develop at a high speed. Some reactionary bourgeois scholars in China have always believed that agriculture is a negative factor in China's national economy, and that more than 500 million peasants are a major pressure in China's socialist construction. They also believe that the more socialist industrialization develops and the more agricultural technology transformation develops, there will be a lot of labor in rural areas that has nothing to do, and the state will not be able to settle them. Although the facts of the past few years have refuted their such clichés, they still continue to spread poison to the people. What is the reason for this? This is because: their bourgeois decadent ideas and egoism have blinded their eyes, making them unable to see, or unwilling to see, the great role that agriculture plays in China's socialist construction, and the great power that more than 500 million peasants play in China's socialist construction. They use bourgeois eyes to treat socialism, and they can't see the superiority of the socialist system at all, and they can't see the great role of China's large population in the great cause of creating a new China.
    III
    The task of developing the national economy in 1960 is, in general, to better implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, to better implement the Party's fundamental policy of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously, and to strive for the continued leap forward of the national economy on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, in order to achieve this task, the arrangement of the national economic plan for 1960 should further determine agriculture as the foundation, and in accordance with the principle of combining giving priority to the development of heavy industry and rapidly developing agriculture, better handle the relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, and strengthen the weak departments of transportation, power industry, and mining industry in a planned and step-by-step manner, creating conditions for a better comprehensive leap forward in later years.
    Further determining the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation is a prominent new issue for our entire planning work. The new content of the national economic plan for 1960 is to conscientiously implement this policy to promote the progress of various departments of the national economy.
    In 1960, while further consolidating the people's communes, we must actively and gradually promote the technical transformation of agriculture and improve agricultural labor productivity. For this purpose, the state must greatly increase the supply of agricultural means of production such as machinery, steel materials, and chemical fertilizers needed for agriculture. At the same time, various localities should carry out a water conservancy construction movement combining large, medium, and small projects. In our country at present, water conservancy construction is the most important condition for increasing agricultural production. In 1959, our country suffered from severe droughts and floods. If it were not for the mass movement of large-scale water conservancy construction carried out on the basis of collectivization and communization, which greatly increased the irrigated area and greatly improved the ability to prevent droughts and floods, it would be impossible to imagine the miracle of not only not reducing production but also continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959. In 1960, we must continue to do this work on the basis of the farmland water conservancy construction movement that was launched in the autumn of 1959 with tens of millions of laborers participating, increase the new irrigated area, increase the supply of drainage and irrigation equipment, and improve the efficiency of the use of the irrigated area, so that agricultural output can continue to rise steadily.
    Another important way to achieve a continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960 is to greatly develop the pig-raising industry and increase organic fertilizer. The output of chemical fertilizers in our country is still not large, and in the recent period, it can only be concentrated on economic crops in order to increase the yield per unit area of such crops. Even if the output of chemical fertilizers increases greatly, the main source of fertilizer in our country will still be pig-raising and raising other livestock. If, as some production teams, some people's communes, and individual counties have done, all parts of the country can first achieve one pig per person in a few years, and then achieve one pig per mu in a few more years, plus the large increase in chemical fertilizers, then the fertilizer problem in our country can be completely solved. Pig manure and other livestock manure are organic fertilizers, which are much better than inorganic chemical fertilizers. It can be said that a pig is a small organic fertilizer factory. Moreover, pork can be eaten, pig bristles and pig skin are raw materials for daily industrial products, and pig internal organs are raw materials for valuable medicines. Pigs are treasures all over their bodies, and every part of their body, as long as they are fully utilized, has important economic value. Therefore, it is wrong to not pay attention to the pig-raising industry and not vigorously develop the pig-raising industry.
    Another important way to achieve a continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1960 is to develop diversified agricultural operations while continuing to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link. In 1959, the total agricultural output value in our country greatly exceeded the planned target of increasing by 10 percent, and an important reason was that since the spring of 1959, all localities have generally paid attention to diversified agricultural operations, promoting the comprehensive development of agriculture. This is a very important experience. In 1960, we should simultaneously promote grain crops and economic crops under the condition of ensuring a greater increase in grain production, and simultaneously promote agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and we must especially grasp agriculture and animal husbandry. If grain production increases greatly, we can have more feed and forage to raise more livestock. Conversely, if animal husbandry develops greatly, we will have more fertilizer to greatly develop agriculture. Our policy is to enable grain, cotton, oil crops, hemp, tea, tobacco, sugar crops, silkworm cocoons, fruits, vegetables, medicinal materials, and miscellaneous agricultural crops to develop together.
    The great development of agriculture will, on the one hand, provide more raw materials for light industry, thereby promoting the great development of light industry; on the other hand, it will put forward increasingly greater demands on heavy industry to supply agricultural means of production, thereby promoting the great development of heavy industry.
    The central issue in developing light industry in 1960 is to expand the source of raw materials from various aspects. The utilization rate of our light industrial equipment has been continuously improving over the years, but there is still considerable potential. In order to make full use of the existing light industrial equipment and further increase the production of light industrial products, we should find new raw materials in many ways while increasing the production and purchase of agricultural raw materials. Widely collect various wild plants and animals, and collect all usable light industrial raw materials, such as cotton stalk skin, tobacco stalk skin, sesame stalk, corn stalk, etc. At the same time, the heavy industry sector should also take active measures to strive to increase the raw materials for the production of living materials within the possible scope. In order to meet the growing needs of the people's lives in the future, we should also carry out appropriate capital construction in light industry, and build some light industrial enterprises that are urgently needed by the people's lives and have a guaranteed supply of raw materials, such as sugar factories, paper mills, cotton textile mills, chemical fiber plants, etc.
    In 1960, heavy industry should continue to take steel as the key link in priority development, strengthen support for agriculture, strengthen some weak links in the national economy, improve quality and increase variety, and carry out appropriate new construction. Supporting agricultural technology transformation is an indispensable part of socialist industrialization. All our heavy industry sectors should establish the view of serving agriculture and regard supporting agricultural technology transformation as their due responsibility. All enterprises producing agricultural means of production should specifically study the actual needs of the local area at the time, and try to make their production adapt to these needs as much as possible, and make development plans for later years. Because in the recent years, our agriculture will adopt a large number of improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools, local industries and commune-run industries at all levels should give full play to their strength, adopt a method of combining foreign and local methods, and promote the technical transformation of agriculture from many aspects. After two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward, the relationship between various departments of our heavy industry has become more coordinated, and some originally weak departments have quickly caught up. However, there are also some departments that are relatively weak, such as the power industry, some mining industries, the petroleum industry, etc. In the continued priority development of heavy industry, efforts should be made to strengthen the construction of these departments so that they can better adapt to the needs of the continued leap forward of the entire industry and the entire national economy. All heavy industrial enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, should make great efforts in the continued leap forward of production to improve the technical level and strive for the continued leap forward of quantity, quality, and variety at the same time. In order to ensure that heavy industry can continuously leap forward in 1960 and later years, and better serve agricultural construction, light industry construction, transportation construction, and national defense construction, various heavy industry departments will continue to carry out large-scale capital construction in 1960. In construction, we must better implement the policy of combining large-scale enterprises with small and medium-sized enterprises, rationally utilizing the old coastal industrial bases, and actively building new inland industrial bases, so as to more properly handle the scale of enterprise construction and the problem of rational industrial layout.
    An important task in developing the national economy in 1960 is to strengthen the construction of transportation so that transportation adapts to the needs of the continued leap forward of production and construction. Railway construction is the focus of transportation construction. The number of newly built railway trunk lines and branch lines in 1960 will be much more than in previous years, and we should ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this task. Since 1958, many localities have built many simple railways and light rail railways, which is the concretization of the policy of simultaneously promoting large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously promoting foreign production methods and local production methods in the transportation sector. It has now been seen that in railway construction, simultaneously promoting the construction of heavy-rail railways and the construction of light-rail railways, simultaneously promoting the construction of modern railways and the construction of simple railways, simultaneously promoting the construction of trunk lines and the construction of branch lines and special lines, and simultaneously promoting the construction of new lines and the strengthening of old lines, this series of policies is completely correct. These policies should be continued to be implemented in 1960. And such experience should be applied to all transportation departments according to specific conditions.
    Agriculture, light industry, heavy industry, transportation, and other departments should more widely and deeply carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in 1960. The fact is very obvious that the possibility of innovating technology is endless, and combining labor enthusiasm with innovating technology can give more and more play to the potential power of people and things, so that production can continue to leap forward. In small and medium-sized enterprises with backward technology and old enterprises with relatively backward technology, technical innovation and technical revolution should be widely carried out. Even in large-scale modern newly built enterprises, it is possible and necessary to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. The high-speed development of China's economy in the future should rely on two sources: one is to carry out capital construction and increase new production capacity; the other is to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in existing enterprises, in all national economic sectors, continuously tap potential, and greatly improve labor productivity. In terms of developing technology, we should have a strong determination and confidence, and in accordance with the spirit of self-reliance, catch up and strive to master the world's advanced technology in a relatively short period of time. For this purpose, all departments should resolutely follow the mass line, continue to boldly mobilize the masses, break superstitions, liberate their minds, promote the spirit of daring to think and daring to do, support the rationalization proposals and creations of the masses, and promote advanced experience. Enterprise departments should strengthen the cultural and technical education of employees, improve the cultural and technical level of employees, and cooperate with education departments to train high-level and intermediate-level technical talents, and strive to establish a strong team of scientific and technological cadres of the working class who are both red and expert. In the method of carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, we should grasp both ends and drive the middle, that is, grasp both the technologically advanced units and the technologically backward units; grasp both the cutting-edge technology and the simple technology, to promote the universal improvement of China's technical level.
    To achieve the task of continued leap forward in agriculture, light industry, heavy industry, and transportation, to widely carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, the key question is to adhere to the policy of combining centralized leadership and carrying out mass movements, and continue to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement on all fronts. Only by carrying out mass movements on a large scale, and taking technical innovation and technical revolution as the central content, can we better combine hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and make the masses' labor enthusiasm rise higher and higher. Only in the movement can the masses themselves be tempered, and the collective wisdom be greatly brought into play; can the leading cadres at all levels better understand the emotions and demands of the masses, learn the masses' enthusiasm and creativity, thereby improving the level of leadership work.
    We must adhere to the Party's leadership and adhere to putting politics in command. We must carry out the anti-Rightist struggle to the end in all enterprises and institutions, in all departments and all places, thoroughly expose and criticize bourgeois ideology, and establish socialist and communist ideology.
    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the very rich experience we have gained in large-scale mass movements is concentrated on one point, that is, we must hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we must conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought, and widely publicize Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we truly understand and implement Comrade Mao Zedong's policies, and closely rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, we will surely be able to continuously achieve great victories in socialist construction, and make the national economy continue to leap forward continuously, comprehensively, and better and better.

    迎接一九六○年的新跃进
    李富春
     一
    在党的八届八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲的号召下，经过全国人民的努力，一九五九年的国民经济计划已经超额完成了。根据初步统计的材料，在工业方面，八届八中全会所提出、经过全国人民代表大会常务委员会通过的一九五九年的几项主要指标，都已经超额完成。工业总产值大大超过了八中全会所提出的比一九五八年增长百分之二十五点六的指标，钢产量超额完成了一千二百万吨的计划指标，达到一千三百万吨以上，煤产量也显著地超过了计划指标三亿三千五百万吨的数字。一九五九年我国的农业遇到了几十年来仅有的严重自然灾害，受灾面积达到了六亿多亩，约占全部耕地面积的三分之一以上，但是，我们在农业战线上还是取得了突出的成就，农业总产值较计划指标超过很多。一九五九年的基本建设，也完成了预计的投资总额。这样，我们接着一九五八的大跃进，在一九五九年实现了国民经济的继续大跃进。
    一九五九年的大跃进，仍然是一个全面的跃进，而且是一个更好的跃进。无论哪一个部门，哪一个地区，社会主义建设事业都有了巨大的发展。在工业方面，产品的品种有了很大的增加，质量有了显著的提高，成本也有很多的降低。拿小洋高炉为例，在一九五九年十月份，设备利用系数达到了平均每立方米日产零点九吨左右，生铁的合格率达到了百分之八十左右，成本比一九五八年第四季度约降低百分之四十。在农业方面，农、林、牧、副、渔各业得到了互相结合的全面发展，粮食、棉花、油料、麻类、茶叶、烟叶、糖料、蚕丝、果类、蔬菜、药材、杂品各项农作物都毫无例外地有了很大的增产。在工农业生产全面地更好地发展的基础上，交通运输业取得了比其他部门更高的发展速度，市场呈现了一片新的繁荣景象。
    经过一九五九年的继续大跃进，我国在一九五八年开始出现的国民经济发展的又高速度、又按比例的跃进局面，已经完全奠定下来了。
    一九五八年和一九五九年的连续大跃进，使我们原来拟定的第二个五年计划主要指标，在两年内完成了。一九五六年九月党的第八届全国代表大会第一次会议通过的关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议，要求一九六二年比一九五七年，工业总产值增长一倍左右，农业总产值增长百分之三十左右。要求到一九六二年，钢产量达到一千零五十万至一千二百万吨，煤产量达到一亿九千万至二亿一千万吨，发电量达到四百亿至四百三十亿度，机床产量达到六万至六万五千台，棉纱产量达到八百万至九百万件，粮食产量达到五千亿斤左右，棉花产量达到四千八百万担左右。上述主要指标，在一九五九年，都已经完成或者超额完成了。这样，我们就可以在今后三年中把原定的第二个五年计划指标大大提高，并且可以腾出手来，用较多的力量来加强国民经济中的某些薄弱环节，使我国社会主义建设能继续高速度地、按比例地发展。
    由于第一个五年计划的胜利完成，我国已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础；经过一九五八年和一九五九年的连续大跃进，这个初步基础就更进一步地加强了。在这两年的连续大跃进中，几乎所有的重工业产品，产量都增长了一倍以上。除西藏以外，我国各个省、市、自治区都建立了钢铁工业和机械工业，以及其他的重工业和轻工业。一个以钢铁和机械为中心的、大中小型企业相结合的、地区分布比较合理的全国完整的工业体系，正在迅速形成中；各地区经济发展不平衡的状况，正在逐步改变。一九五八年我国钢材和机器设备的自给率都已经达到了百分之八十，一九五九年又有了进一步的提高。在技术革命的口号的鼓舞下，所有的企业都提高了技术水平，扩大了技术队伍。我们已经能够自己设计和自己建设技术比较复杂的现代化企业。同时，人民公社已经成为我国广大农村的基层组织，它是动员我国五亿多农民积极参加社会主义建设的、政治和经济互相结合的、最好的组织形式，它为迅速发展农业和在农村迅速发展工业及其他经济、文化事业开辟了最广阔的道路。经过一年来的整顿和发展，它的优越性已经更加显示出来了。
    在一九五六年我们公布第二个五年计划的时候，在一九五九年夏季我们调整当年计划指标的时候，帝国主义散布谎言，发出各种各样的叫嚣来攻击我国，企图在世界各国人民面前混淆视听。但是历史的发展无情地粉碎了帝国主义的谎言和叫嚣。
    我们用两年的时间完成了原来曾以为要五年才能够办完的事情，这个事实无可辩驳地证实了，党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线以及一系列有关的方针，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国建设的具体实践相结合的路线，是完全合乎我国经济的客观规律的。两年来的伟大实践，使我们从不断的巨大的胜利中积累了丰富的经验，并且也从某些暂时的、个别的、局部的困难和曲折中得到了宝贵的经验。人们知道，任何新的伟大事业，在发展过程中，都不可避免地要遇到某些困难和曲折，并且总是能够克服困难而不断前进。大跃进中各方面的经验，武装了我们的广大干部，也武装了全国的人民。我们有了这样的经验，就能够深刻地认识和更自觉地执行党的总路线，也就能够在社会主义建设中发挥出更大得多的积极性和创造性。我们有了前面所说的由两年连续大跃进所创造的物质和技术的条件，又有了这里所说的由于党的总路线深入人心而造成的政治和思想的条件，跃进的局面能够继续不断地向前发展，是确定无疑的了。

    毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中说：“我国有五亿多农业人口，农民的情况如何，对于我国经济的发展和政权的巩固，关系极大。”他又说：“工业化道路的问题，主要是指重工业、轻工业和农业的发展关系问题。我国的经济建设是以重工业为中心，这一点必须肯定。但是同时必须充分注意发展农业和轻工业。”①两年来连续大跃进中所取得的成就，最突出的就是我们党在毛泽东同志的领导下，已经制定了一条正确解决重工业、轻工业和农业的发展关系问题的总路线，就是我们党找到了一条经过实践考验而证明完全正确的在我国实现社会主义工业化的道路。
    农民问题、农业问题，无论在我国民主革命时期，或者在社会主义革命时期，都是头等重要的问题。多年来社会主义建设的经验特别是两年来的经验一再证明：我们的农业发展了，我们的一切经济工作就更好办了。不但轻工业更好办，而且重工业也更好办了。加快农业的发展，这是高速度地、按比例地发展我国社会主义经济的中心环节。
    毛泽东同志多年来阐明了农业对于发展国民经济的极端重要的作用。他在一九四五年“论联合政府”的报告中说：“农民——这是中国工人的前身。将来还要有几千万农民进入城市，进入工厂。如果中国需要建设强大的民族工业，建设很多近代的大城市，就要有一个变农村人口为城市人口的长过程。”“农民——这是中国工业市场的主体。只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”②在全国解放以后，当我国的工业已经得到恢复并且蓬勃发展起来的时候，毛泽东同志随即指出，农业生产的发展，必须适应于社会主义工业化的需要。他领导了全国农民群众合作化的革命运动。此后，毛泽东同志在“关于十大关系”的演说中，指出正确处理农业和工业的关系，是多快好省地发展国民经济的首要问题。毛泽东同志以后又把这个思想概括为“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举”，“重工业要以农业为重要市场”。大家知道，这个思想已经作为一条重要的方针包括在党的社会主义建设总路线的要点中。
    在这样的方针的指导下，一九五八年比一九五七年，工业总产值增长了百分之六十六，农业总产值增长了百分之二十五，工业总产值的增长为农业的一倍半；重工业总产值增长了百分之一百零三，轻工业总产值增长了百分之三十四，重工业总产值的增长为轻工业的两倍。一九五九年比一九五八年，工农业总产值和重工业、轻工业的总产值继续有了很大的增长，但是农业总产值的增长已经接近工业总产值增长速度的一半，轻工业的增长速度和重工业的增长速度的距离也大为缩短。这样，在农业、轻工业、重工业同时跃进中，工业和农业之间的比例关系更加协调了，重工业和轻工业之间的比例关系也更加协调了。
    农业、轻工业和重工业之间的比例关系更加协调，有利于国民经济的继续跃进，也有利于工农联盟的进一步巩固。我国的工农联盟，是在工人阶级领导下的、经过民主革命和社会主义革命而不断地巩固和发展起来的联盟。全国解放以后，我国的工农联盟已经经历了两个阶段，第一个阶段就是把工农联盟建立在彻底实行土地改革的基础上，第二个阶段就是经过农业合作化和人民公社化，把工农联盟建立在社会主义所有制的基础上。现在我国的工农联盟开始进入第三个阶段，要建立在新的基础上，这就是在继续发展社会主义所有制的同时，逐步实现农业的技术改造，逐步实现农业的现代化。我国农业由于人民公社化和生产迅速发展，为扩大再生产所需要的公共积累正在大大增加；农业生产规模扩大和经营项目增多，也为农业的技术改造创造了良好的条件。同时，重工业由于实现了连续的大跃进，为农业技术改造所需要的钢铁和机械的产量已经比过去多得多了；地方工业特别是县、社工业的普遍发展，能够在农业技术改造方面发挥愈来愈大的作用。在这样的情况下，就有可能逐步地把工农联盟推进到一个新阶段，即农业现代化的新阶段。
    有的同志认为，迅速发展农业是同优先发展重工业的方针不相容的。这种意见，当然是错误的。迅速发展农业，不但不会妨碍，相反地会大大促进重工业的发展。毛泽东同志说：
  “大家知道，轻工业和农业有极密切的关系。没有农业，就没有轻工业。重工业要以农业为重要市场这一点，目前还没有使人们看得很清楚。但是随着农业的技术改革逐步发展，农业的日益现代化，为农业服务的机械、肥料、水利建设、电力建设、运输建设、民用燃料、民用建筑材料等等将日益增多，重工业以农业为重要市场的情况，将会易于为人们所理解。”③我国的农业是有五亿多人口从事的农业，不但对于轻工业，而且对于重工业，是世界上任何国家都无法比拟的最广阔的国内市场。随着农业生产的迅速发展，随着农业技术改造的日益推进，它要求重工业每年提供大量的农业生产资料。从长期来看，我国需要有几百万台拖拉机，几百万辆载重汽车，几千万吨化学肥料，大量的电力、燃料、建筑材料和其他各种农业机械，以及大量的现代化的交通运输工具。满足这种需要，我国的重工业就不能只是几倍地发展，而必须十几倍、几十倍地发展。重工业用这样多的农业生产资料把农业装备起来以后，农、林、牧、副、渔的多种经营就可以大量地发展，我国的农业的总产量就可以几倍、十几倍地增长，农业劳动生产率就可以几十倍、成百倍地提高，农业就可以提供极为丰富的农产品、畜产品、林产品和其他各种工业原料，就可以为工业和其他事业输送成亿的劳动力。
    由此看来，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业，这两件事情是互为条件、互相结合、互相促进的。只要这样，我们的农业、轻工业、重工业就可以高速度地发展，整个国民经济也可以高速度地发展。国内有些反动的资产阶级学者，一直认为，农业是我国国民经济中的消极因素，五亿多农民是我国社会主义建设事业中的重大压力。他们并且认为，社会主义工业化愈发展，农业技术改造愈发展，农村就会有很多的劳动力没有事做，国家也无法安置。尽管几年来的事实驳斥了他们这样的陈词滥调，可是他们却还是继续向人民散布毒素。这究竟是什么原因呢？这是因为：他们的资产阶级的腐朽观念和利己主义，蒙蔽了他们的眼睛，使他们看不到，或者不愿意看到农业在我国社会主义建设中所起的伟大作用，五亿多农民在我国社会主义建设中所发挥的伟大力量。他们用资产阶级的眼光来看待社会主义，就一点也看不到社会主义制度的优越性，一点也看不到我国众多人口在创造新中国的伟大事业中的伟大作用。
    三
    一九六○年发展国民经济的任务，总的说来是：更好地贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，更好地贯彻执行党的发展工业和发展农业同时并举的根本方针，在一九五八年和一九五九年连续大跃进的基础上，争取国民经济的继续跃进。根据毛泽东同志的指示，为着实现这个任务，一九六○年国民经济计划的安排，应当进一步地确定以农业为基础，按照优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合的原则，更好地处理农业、轻工业、重工业各部门之间的关系，并且有计划有步骤地加强运输业、动力工业、采掘工业等薄弱部门，创造以后年份更好的全面跃进的条件。
    进一步确定以农业为基础的方针，对我们的整个计划工作说来，是一个突出的新问题。一九六○年国民经济计划的新内容，就是要认真地贯彻执行这个方针，来推动国民经济各部门的前进。
    在一九六○年，要在进一步巩固人民公社的同时，积极地、逐步地推进农业的技术改造，提高农业劳动生产率。为着这个目的，国家要大大地增加农业所需要的机械、钢铁材料、化学肥料等农业生产资料的供应。同时，各地方要开展大中小型工程相结合的水利建设运动。在我国目前，兴修水利是增加农业生产最重要的条件。一九五九年我们国家遭受了严重的旱灾和水灾，如果不是在合作化、公社化的基础上开展了大规模的水利建设的群众运动，使灌溉面积大大增加，使防旱、防涝的能力大大提高，要在一九五九年出现不但不减产而且能够继续大跃进的奇迹，那是不可能设想的。在一九六○年，我们要在一九五九年秋季所开展起来的有几千万劳动力参加的农田水利建设运动的基础上，继续做好这项工作，增加新的灌溉面积，增加排灌设备的供应，提高灌溉面积的使用效益，使农业产量不断地稳定地上升。
    实现一九六○年农业生产继续跃进的另一个重要的办法，是要大量地发展养猪事业，增加有机肥料。我国化学肥料的产量还不大，在最近一个时期，还只能集中使用于经济作物，以便提高这类作物的单位面积产量。即使化学肥料大量增产了，我国肥料的主要来源，将还是养猪和饲养其他牲畜。如果像有些生产队、有些人民公社和个别的县所做到的那样，全国各地第一步在几年之内做到一人一口猪，第二步再用几年时间做到一亩地一口猪，加上化学肥料的大量增产，那么，我国的肥料问题就可以得到完全的解决。猪肥和其他畜肥是有机肥料，比无机化学肥料好得多。可以说，一头猪就是一座小型有机肥料工厂。而且猪肉可以吃，猪鬃、猪皮是日用工业品的原料，猪的内脏是贵重药品的原料。猪浑身是宝，它身体上的每一个部分只要充分地利用，都有重要的经济价值。因此，不重视养猪事业，不大力发展养猪事业，是不对的。
    实现一九六○年农业生产继续跃进的再一个重要的办法，就是在继续执行以粮为纲的方针下，发展农业的多种经营。一九五九年我国农业总产值大大超过了预计增长百分之十的指标，重要的原因就在于一九五九年春季开始，各地方都普遍地注意了农业的多种经营，促进了农业的全面发展。这是一个很重要的经验。在一九六○年，我们应当在保证粮食有较多增产的条件下，实行粮食作物和经济作物同时并举，实行农业、林业、畜牧业、副业、渔业同时并举，要特别抓住农业，抓住畜牧业。粮食大大增产了，我们就可以有更多的饲料、饲草来饲养更多的牲畜。反过来，畜牧业大大发展了，我们就有更多的肥料来大大发展农业。我们的方针，是要使粮食、棉花、油料、麻类、茶叶、烟叶、糖料、蚕丝、果类、蔬菜、药材、杂品得到共同发展。
    农业的大发展，一方面将为轻工业提供更多的原料，从而促进轻工业的大发展；另一方面又将向重工业提出愈来愈大的供应农业生产资料的要求，从而促进重工业的大发展。
    一九六○年发展轻工业的中心问题，是要从多方面扩大原料来源。我们的轻工业设备，利用率历年都不断提高，但是仍然有相当大的潜在力量。为着充分利用现有的轻工业设备，进一步增加轻工业产品的生产，应当在增加农作物原料的生产和收购的同时，多方找寻新的原料。广泛收集各种野生的植物和动物，收集一切可以利用的轻工业原料，如棉秆皮、烟秆皮、芝麻秆、包谷秆等等。同时，重工业部门也应当采取积极的措施，在可能的范围内努力增产生活资料生产的原料。为着适应今后人民生活日益增长的需要，我们还应当适当进行轻工业的基本建设，建设一些人民生活迫切需要而原料供应又有保证的轻工业企业，如糖厂、纸厂、棉纺织厂、化学纤维厂等。
    一九六○年重工业在优先发展中，应当继续以钢为纲，加强对农业的支援，加强国民经济中的某些薄弱环节，提高质量和增加品种，并且适当进行新的建设。支援农业技术改造是社会主义工业化不可缺少的内容，我们的各个重工业部门，都应当树立为农业服务的观点，把支援农业技术改造看成自己应尽的责任。所有生产农业生产资料的企业，都要具体研究当地当时的实际需要，尽可能使自己的生产适应于这种需要，并且做出以后年份发展的规划。由于在最近几年内，我们的农业将大量地采用改良农具和半机械化农具，因此，各级地方工业和社办工业应当充分发挥自己的力量，采取洋土结合的办法，从多方面推进农业的技术改造。我们的重工业经过两年来的连续大跃进，各部门之间的关系已经更加趋于协调，某些原来薄弱的部门已经很快地赶上来了。但是，也还有一些部门比较薄弱，如动力工业、某些采掘工业、石油工业等。重工业在继续优先发展中，应当努力加强这些部门的建设，使它们更好地适应于整个工业以及整个国民经济继续跃进的需要。所有的重工业企业，首先是中小型的企业，在生产的继续跃进中，都要用很大的努力，提高技术水平，争取数量、质量和品种同时继续跃进。为了保证重工业在一九六○年和以后年份能够连续不断地跃进，更好地为农业建设、轻工业建设、交通运输建设、国防建设服务，重工业各部门在一九六○年将要继续进行规模巨大的基本建设。在建设中，要更好地贯彻执行大型企业和中小型企业相结合、合理利用沿海老工业基地和积极建设内地新工业基地相结合的方针，以便更加妥善地处理企业建设规模和工业合理布局的问题。
    一九六○年发展国民经济的一项重要的任务，是加强交通运输的建设，使交通运输同生产和建设继续跃进的需要相适应。铁路建设是交通运输建设的重点。一九六○年新建的铁路干线和支线，将比往年多得多，我们应当保证这个任务的完成和超额完成。一九五八年以来，许多地方修建了不少的简易铁路和轻轨铁路，这是工业上大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针在交通运输部门的具体化。现在已经看到，在铁路建设中，建设重轨铁路和建设轻轨铁路同时并举，建设现代化铁路和建设简易铁路同时并举，建设干线和建设支线、专用线同时并举，以及建设新线和加强旧线同时并举，这一系列的方针，是完全正确的。一九六○年应当继续执行这些方针。并且应当根据具体条件，把这样的经验应用到所有的交通运输部门中去。
    农业、轻工业、重工业、交通运输业等部门一九六○年都应当把技术革新和技术革命更加广泛地、更加深入地开展起来。事实很明显，革新技术的可能性是无穷无尽的，使劳动热情同革新技术相结合，就可以愈来愈多地发挥人和物的潜在力量，使生产不断跃进。在技术落后的中小企业和技术比较落后的老企业中，固然应当广泛地进行技术革新和技术革命，就是在大型现代化的新建企业中，也有可能和必要进行技术革新和技术革命。今后我国经济的高速度发展，应当依靠两个来源：一个是进行基本建设，增加新的生产能力；另一个是在原有的企业中，在一切国民经济部门中，进行技术革新和技术革命，不断地挖掘潜力，大大地提高劳动生产率。在发展技术方面，我们应当有坚强的决心和信心，并且按照自力更生的精神，迎头赶上，争取在比较短的时间内掌握世界上的先进技术。为了这个目的，各个部门都应当坚决走群众路线，继续放手发动群众，破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢做的精神，支持群众的合理化建议和创造，推广先进经验。企业部门要加强职工的文化、技术教育，提高职工的文化、技术水平，并且配合教育部门，培养高级和中级的技术人材，为建立一支工人阶级的又红又专的科学技术干部的强大队伍而斗争。在进行技术革新和技术革命的方法上，应当抓住两头，带动中间，即一手抓技术先进的单位，一手抓技术落后的单位；一手抓尖端的技术，一手抓简易的技术，来促进我国技术水平的普遍提高。
    要实现农业、轻工业、重工业、交通运输业的继续跃进的任务，要广泛开展技术革新和技术革命，决定的问题还是要坚持集中领导和开展群众运动相结合的方针，继续开展各个战线上的增产节约运动。只有大规模地开展群众运动，并且以技术革新和技术革命为中心内容，才能更好地把苦干、实干和巧干结合起来，使群众的劳动热情愈来愈高涨。也只有在运动中，才能使群众自己得到锻炼，大大发挥集体的智慧；才能使各级领导干部更好地了解群众的情绪和要求，学习群众的干劲和创造，从而提高领导工作的水平。
    我们要坚持党的领导，坚持政治挂帅。要在所有的企业单位和事业单位中，在所有部门和所有地方，把反右倾斗争进行到底，彻底地揭发和批判资产阶级思想，树立社会主义、共产主义思想。
    一九五八年大跃进以来，在大规模的群众运动中，我们所取得的非常丰富的经验，集中到一点，就是必须高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，必须认真学习毛泽东思想，广泛宣传毛泽东思想。只要我们真正领会和贯彻执行毛泽东同志的方针，紧紧地依靠群众的积极性和创造性，我们就一定能够不断地取得社会主义建设的伟大胜利，使国民经济持续地、全面地和愈来愈好地跃进。
