    Establishing Feed Processing Stations, Promoting Maize Planting
    Czechoslovakia Averages One Pig Per Two People

    Czechoslovakia's animal husbandry production saw significant development in 1959. The total number of pigs increased by 400,000 head, reaching a historic high. The national average is close to one pig for every two people. The number of cattle also increased by 110,000 head in 1959. The establishment of feed processing stations and the promotion of maize planting played a significant role in last year's animal husbandry production.

    Last year, Czechoslovak agricultural product purchasing departments established many "feed processing stations" across the country. These stations used the latest scientific achievements to add various antibiotics and vitamins to mixed feed, supplying the needs of state farms and agricultural production cooperatives with remarkable results. According to surveys, pigs fed this feed saw their daily weight gain increase from 0.3 kilograms to 0.7 kilograms in a short period of time.

    In Czechoslovakia, where maize was hardly planted in the past, 140,000 hectares of maize were planted last year, ensuring a sufficient supply of winter feed.

    建立饲料加工站　推广玉蜀黍种植
    捷平均每两人有猪一头
    捷克斯洛伐克畜牧业生产在1959年中获得了很大的发展。全年猪的头数已增加四十万头，总头数达到历史上的最高水平。全国平均将近达到每两个人一头猪，1959年全年牛也增加了十一万头。在去年畜牧业生产中，建立饲料加工站和推广种植玉蜀黍起了重大作用。
    去年捷克斯洛伐克农产品收购部门在全国建立了许多“饲料加工站”，它们利用科学的最新成就将各种抗菌素和维他命加入到混合的饲料中，供应国营农场和农业生产合作社的需要，效果显著。据调查，猪食用这种饲料后，在很短时间内，每天的长肉率即从零点三公斤增加到零点七公斤。
    在过去几乎不种植玉蜀黍的捷克斯洛伐克，去年种植了十四万公顷玉蜀黍。保证了冬季饲料的充足供应。
