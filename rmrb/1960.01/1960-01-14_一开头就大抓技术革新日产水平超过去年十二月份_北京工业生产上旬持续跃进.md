Xinhua News Agency, 12th - Capital industrial production has continued to make an all-round leap forward in the first ten days of January. From the 1st to the 10th, the city's average daily industrial output value exceeded that of December last year by 13.9%. The output of major products such as steel, coal, electricity, cement, and cotton yarn all exceeded the daily output level of late December last year. The steel output in ten days broke the highest daily output record of last year for nine days. The machinery industry broke the usual practice of not producing finished products at the beginning of the year, and produced finished products such as machine tools and freight cars on the first day of the year. The quality of many products has improved significantly.

The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the city has formed a new situation of blooming and bearing fruit everywhere from the beginning. According to statistics from only 134 factories, 1,132 technical innovations were realized and 168 advanced experiences were promoted in five days. On the first day of this year, workers at the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant self-reliantly built two semi-automated assembly lines for spraying automobile headlights and assembling carburetors, which greatly improved the production level. In December last year, the highest daily output of headlight spraying and carburetor assembly was 600 and 700 respectively, but now it has increased to 2,000 and more than 1,000 respectively, and the product quality is very good. The North China Radio Equipment Factory realized 149 major innovations in the first two days, and the factory had already completed 53.1% of the monthly output value plan in the first ten days of January. The converter steelmaking pilot plant of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Beijing Steel Plant, and Special Steel Plant continued to promote advanced experiences such as oxygen blowing and rapid charging, all creating high-yield records that had not been achieved last year, and the product quality reached a new level. The main types of work, such as lathe workers, fitters, and forging workers in Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, widely adopted the advanced experience promoted by the representatives of the National Heroes Congress, and the production in the first ten days of January was red every day, completing the plan for the first ten days one day ahead of schedule. Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory widely carried out a lively technical performance competition, with more than 1,000 people participating in the performance within three days, so the factory produced 76 freight cars in the first ten days of January, exceeding the output of any ten days in January of last year.

    一开头就大抓技术革新日产水平超过去年十二月份
    北京工业生产上旬持续跃进
    新华社12日讯　首都工业生产1月上旬持续地全面跃进。1到10日，全市工业平均日产值超过去年12月份13．9％。钢、煤、电力、水泥、棉纱等主要产品产量，都超过去年12月下旬的日产水平。十天的钢产量，有九天突破去年最高日产纪录。机械工业打破以往年初不出成品的常规，开门第一天就生产出机床和货车等成品。许多产品的质量有显著提高。
    全市技术革新和技术革命运动一开始就形成了遍地开花结果的新局面。仅据一百三十四个工厂的统计，五天内就实现了技术革新一千一百三十二项，推广先进经验一百六十八项。北京汽车制造厂工人在今年头一天，就自力更生地建成汽车大小灯喷漆和化油器装配两条半自动化流水线，使生产水平大大提高。去年12月份，大灯喷漆和化油器装配的最高日产量是六百个和七百个，现在已分别提高到两千个和一千多个，而且产品质量很好。华北无线电器材厂头两天就实现重大革新一百四十九项，全厂在上旬已经完成全月产值计划53．1％。石景山钢铁公司转炉炼钢试验厂、北京钢厂和特殊钢厂继续推广加氧吹炼、快速装料等先进经验，都创造了去年没有过的高产纪录，而且产品质量达到了新的水平。北京农业机械厂车工、钳工、锻工等主要工种广泛采用全国群英会代表推广的先进经验，上旬生产日日红，提前一天完成了上旬计划。长辛店机车车辆工厂广泛开展热火朝天的技术表演赛，三天内就有一千多人参加表演，因此全厂上旬就生产出七十六台货车。超过了去年任何一个月上旬的产量。
