    Freedom and Consciousness
    Xing Bensi

People with different worldviews have different views on freedom. One is the freedom of the proletariat, and the other is the so-called freedom of the bourgeoisie. Those with a bourgeois worldview tout so-called freedom as doing whatever one pleases, acting without restraint; if a person's actions are even slightly restricted, it cannot be considered freedom. This view of freedom suggests that there is an absolute, unconditional freedom in the world.

Is there really such a freedom in the world? No. All freedom is relative and conditional.

First, freedom is constrained by objective necessity. That is to say, no one's actions can escape the restrictions of objective laws. It is true that people are not powerless in the face of objective laws, and they can utilize objective laws to serve their interests, but before utilizing objective laws, they must first be able to understand these laws and make their actions conform to these laws. Only by first obeying nature can one then transform nature. If a person does not respect objective necessity, and departs from or violates objective necessity to act freely, then the only possible outcome is passivity everywhere, inability to move an inch, and even banging one's head against a brick wall. Therefore, freedom and necessity cannot be placed in opposition; freedom and necessity are a unity of opposites. Before people recognize necessity, they cannot speak of any freedom, and once they recognize necessity, they can act freely within the scope permitted by that necessity. As Engels said, "Freedom does not consist in any dreamt-of independence from natural law, but in the knowledge of these laws, and in the possibility this gives of systematically making them work towards definite ends," and "Freedom is the appreciation of necessity." (Anti-Dühring, p. 117)

Second, in the realm of social life, freedom is constrained by discipline. Every individual is a social being and exists within certain social relationships. Marx said that man is the sum total of social relations. Therefore, any social formation requires a certain discipline to maintain its social relations, and individual behavior is always subject to social constraints.

In class society, freedom has a class character. Whether it is slave society, feudal society, or capitalist society, freedom is only the freedom of a few reactionary ruling classes. This small group monopolizes freedom in their own hands, while imposing all kinds of discipline on the working people: the discipline of the whip, the discipline of hunger, etc. Behind these disciplines, there is the coercive power of the state as a backing. The bourgeoisie are most fond of flaunting slogans such as freedom, equality, and fraternity. To this day, the bourgeoisie of imperialist countries are still boasting that they are the "free world." However, as Lenin said, as long as it is a bourgeois state, "even in the most free and democratic republic, 'freedom' and 'equality' can only be and always have been freedom and equality for the owners of commodities, freedom and equality for capital." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 29, p. 342) It can be seen that in class society, the working people have no freedom to speak of, let alone any absolute individual freedom.

In class society, not only do the working people have no absolute individual freedom to speak of, but even the ruling class, although they monopolize freedom, each individual member of the ruling class cannot have absolute individual freedom. Their behavior is also subject to the constraints of the class to which they belong. Of course, this constraint is fundamentally different in nature from the constraint of the ruling class on the behavior of the ruled class. The latter has the nature of dictatorship, while the former does not.

In the future communist society, because classes have been completely eliminated, freedom will no longer have a class character and will be enjoyed by everyone. However, even then, there will be no absolute individual freedom. At that time, every individual, as an equal member of society, can enjoy full freedom while also having to abide by collective discipline. Moreover, due to the all-round development of people and the great improvement of consciousness, obeying discipline will become people's instinct and habit, and freedom and discipline will achieve an unprecedented harmonious unity. Engels said: "On the one hand, a certain authority, no matter how it is constituted, and on the other hand, a certain subordination, are things which, independently of all social organisation, are imposed upon us together with the material conditions under which we produce and make products circulate." (Marx and Engels Selected Works, Vol. 1, p. 613) Communist society is no exception.

It can be seen that in the realm of social life, there is no absolute individual freedom. Freedom is relative to discipline, and freedom and discipline are a unity of opposites.

The unity of opposites between freedom and necessity, the unity of opposites between freedom and discipline—this is the Marxist-Leninist view of freedom.

The view that absolutely opposes freedom and necessity, freedom and discipline, and exaggerates individual freedom to the extreme is a bourgeois view, a manifestation of the bourgeois egocentric individualistic worldview. Capitalist society is the last and most fully developed private property society in human history. Therefore, the individualistic worldview based on private property has reached its peak in this society. Here, the individualistic worldview is a dominant worldview, which runs through all fields of ideology and is also manifested in the views on various issues. When the bourgeoisie looks at the issue of freedom with their tinted glasses of individualistic worldview, they will inevitably describe freedom as absolute and as doing whatever one pleases. In addition, the reason why the bourgeoisie needs such a view of freedom is because they want to use it to justify their actions of "freely" exploiting and squeezing the working people, "freely" plundering and enslaving the colonial people, and "freely" igniting the flames of aggression.

The petty bourgeoisie also likes to describe freedom as absolute and unconditional, because the economic basis of the petty bourgeoisie is also private property. At the same time, the economic activities of the petty bourgeoisie (mainly small producers) are carried out independently and dispersedly, which makes them develop a habit of freedom and laxity. This habit makes them feel incompatible with any constraint or discipline. In addition, in capitalist society, the petty bourgeoisie is in an unstable economic position. When they are on the verge of bankruptcy, they often have a feeling of despair, and anarchism is a "product of this despair." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 5, p. 294) One of the basic views advocated by anarchism is precisely the "absolute freedom" of the individual. This worldview based on individualism is essentially also a bourgeois worldview.

The proletariat will never have the idea of ​​"absolute freedom" of the individual, because their production activities are a joint activity. When they are isolated individuals, they have no power, and production cannot be carried out; and in the revolutionary struggle, they must also have a strong organization. Therefore, the proletariat has a high degree of collectivism. They always regard themselves as a part of the great organism of the entire class, and never emphasize individual freedom as an unrestrained behavior of doing whatever one pleases. The problem is obvious: whether freedom is regarded as relative and conditional, or absolute and unconditional, is essentially a manifestation of two opposing worldviews. The former is a manifestation of the proletarian worldview, and the latter is a manifestation of the bourgeois worldview.

In the current transitional period, since there is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, there is also a struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, and this struggle will inevitably be reflected within the Party. The struggle against right-leaning opportunism carried out within the Party in 1959 is the best proof. There is such a small group of people within the Party who either come from non-proletarian backgrounds and their thinking has not been thoroughly transformed, or whose thinking has degenerated under the influence of the bourgeoisie; although they have joined the Party organizationally, they still retain the bourgeois worldview; they are hostile to the discipline of the proletariat, sing the praises of the so-called freedom of the bourgeoisie, and in some cases, even develop into attacks on the Party. They are very similar to the Menshevik opportunists described by Lenin: "The Party organization appears to them as the monstrous 'factory'; subordination of the part to the whole and of the minority to the majority seems to them to be 'serfdom'... They cry out in pitiful and ridiculous tones at every division of labour under the direction of the centre, against people being transformed into 'cogs and screws'…They assume an air of superiority when the Party Rules are mentioned, scornfully remark (with the intention of being clever) that one could very well dispense with Rules altogether." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 7, p. 386) They not only have fundamental differences with us on the political line, but also have fundamental differences with us on the organizational line. They oppose the organizational principle of democratic centralism and vainly attempt to transform our Party with the bourgeois view of extreme freedom, laying the organizational foundation for the restoration of capitalism.

There are also some comrades within the Party who, although not as hostile to the Party's organization as the people mentioned above, lack a correct understanding of discipline and freedom because they have also been more or less tainted by this bourgeois view of freedom. Some people often feel that organizational life is not free, and some people think that discipline is needed during the war period, and that it can be relaxed a little during the current period of peaceful construction, and there is no need to have strict discipline. They do not understand that democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline "are two contradictory aspects of a single entity. They are contradictory as well as united, and we should not unilaterally emphasize one aspect to the negation of the other." (On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, p. 6) They do not understand that "the Party is a fighting organization, and it is impossible to win any battle without centralized and unified command." (Documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, p. 91) This is true not only for carrying out class struggle and defeating class enemies, but also for carrying out construction and conquering nature. Moreover, at present, class struggle has not been extinguished in our country. In the complex class struggle, the bourgeois worldview and the habits of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will inevitably be reflected within the working class and the Communist Party. These things are like a corrosive agent, and when it takes effect within the Party, it will corrode the Party's unity and solidarity. Therefore, during the period of socialist construction, the Party's discipline cannot be weakened in the slightest.

The Party's discipline never excludes full freedom and democracy within the Party. The Party's centralism is centralism based on democracy. The Party Constitution stipulates that every Party member can participate in free and practical discussions on the theory and practical problems of the Party's policies at Party meetings or in Party newspapers and periodicals; can make suggestions on the Party's work and give full play to creativity in the work; can criticize any organization and any staff member of the Party at Party meetings; if there are disagreements with the Party's resolutions, in addition to unconditionally implementing them, they can reserve them and submit their opinions to the Party's leading organs; can submit statements, appeals, and accusations to any level of Party organization up to the Central Committee, and so on. Of course, freedom within the Party is freedom with leadership, and democracy within the Party is democracy under centralized guidance. Any activity that uses freedom and democracy within the Party to carry out activities that violate the interests of the Party is not allowed. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in the report on amending the Party Constitution: "All measures to develop democracy within the Party are not to weaken the necessary centralization of the Party, but to give it a strong and vigorous basis." (Eighth National Congress Documents, p. 91) What does the Party's discipline mainly rely on to maintain and consolidate? It mainly relies on the consciousness of all Party members to maintain and consolidate. It is true that since it is discipline, it always has a certain degree of coercion. However, if every Party member does not truly realize the great significance of the Party's unity and the Party's unification for the realization of the Party's cause, and does not truly consciously abide by the Party's discipline, then discipline itself, no matter how strict, cannot be strong.

Each of us must eliminate the bourgeois individualistic view of freedom and resolutely establish the proletarian worldview. Only in this way will our consciousness be greatly improved, and we will not feel that the existence of discipline is a "shackle." On the contrary, we will feel that the existence of discipline is necessary to maintain the Party's unity and the Party's unification, thereby ensuring that the Party's cause is invincible. When we have such an understanding and truly develop a habit of consciously abiding by discipline, we will obtain the fullest freedom in Party life.

    自由和自觉
    邢贲思
    具有不同世界观的人，对于自由存在着不同的看法。一种是无产阶级的自由，一种是资产阶级的所谓自由。具有资产阶级世界观的人，他们标榜的所谓自由就是随心所欲，为所欲为，如果一个人的行动稍微受到了一点拘束，就不能算作有自由。这种自由观认为世界上有一种绝对的、无条件的自由。
    世界上到底有没有这样一种自由呢？没有。任何自由都是相对的，有条件的。
    首先，自由要受到客观必然性的制约。也就是说任何一个人的行动都不能不受到客观规律的限制。不错，人们在客观规律面前不是无能为力的，人们可以利用客观规律，使之为人们的利益服务，但是在利用客观规律之前，首先要能够认识这种规律，使自己的行动符合这种规律。只有首先服从自然，然后才能改造自然。一个人如果不尊重客观必然性，离开了、违背了客观必然性去自由行动，那么除了处处被动，寸步难行，甚至碰得头破血流以外，不可能会有别的结果。因此不能把自由和必然对立起来，自由和必然是对立的统一，人们在没有认识必然性以前，谈不上有什么自由，而当人们一旦认识了必然性以后，就能够在这种必然性所许可的范围内充分地自由行动。恩格斯说得好：“自由不是在于想像中的对于自然规律的独立，而是在于认识这些规律，并且在这种认识所给与的可能性之上，有计划地使得自然规律为着一定目的发生作用”，“自由是对于必然的认识。”（反杜林论，第117页）
    其次，在社会生活领域内，自由要受到纪律的制约。任何一个人都是社会的人，都处于一定的社会关系中，马克思说，人是社会关系的总和。因此，任何一个社会形态都需要有一定的纪律来维持其社会关系，个人的行为总是要受到社会的约束。
    在阶级社会中，自由带有阶级性。不论是奴隶社会、封建社会还是资本主义社会，自由都只是少数反动统治阶级的自由，这一小撮人把自由垄断在自己的手中，而却把各种各样的纪律：棍棒的纪律，饥饿的纪律等等加给劳动人民，在这些纪律的背后，有着国家的强制力量作后盾。资产阶级是最喜欢以自由、平等、博爱等口号为标榜的，到今天，帝国主义国家的资产阶级还在吹嘘，说他们那里是“自由世界”。但是，正如列宁所说的，只要它是资产阶级的国家，“即使在最自由最民主的共和国中，‘自由’和‘平等’只能是而且从来就是商品所有者的平等和自由，资本的平等和自由。”（列宁全集第29卷，第342页）可见，在阶级社会中，劳动人民根本无自由可言，当然更谈不上有什么绝对的个人自由。
    在阶级社会中，不但劳动人民根本谈不上有什么绝对的个人自由，就是统治阶级，虽然他们垄断了自由，但是他们中间的每一个个别成员也不可能有绝对的个人自由，他们的行为也要受到他们所属的那个阶级的约束。当然，这种约束和统治阶级对于被统治阶级的行为的约束相比，性质根本不同，后者带有专政性质，前者则不带专政性质。
    在将来的共产主义社会中，由于阶级已经彻底消灭，自由不再带有阶级性，成了人人都可以享有的了。但是，就是在那时，也不存在什么绝对的个人自由，那时，每一个人作为社会平等的一员既可以享有充分的自由，同时又必须遵守集体的纪律。而且由于人的全面发展，觉悟的大大提高，遵守纪律将会成为人们的本能和习惯，自由和纪律将会达到前所未有的和谐的统一。恩格斯说过：“一方面要有一定的权威，不管它是怎样造成的，另方面要有一定的服从——无论在什么样的社会组织下，都是如此。”（马恩文选第一卷，第613页）共产主义社会同样不能例外。
    由此可见，在社会生活的领域内，没有什么绝对的个人自由，自由是对纪律而言的，自由和纪律是对立的统一。
    自由和必然的对立统一，自由和纪律的对立统一，这就是马克思列宁主义的自由观。
    那种把自由和必然、自由和纪律绝对对立起来，把个人的自由夸大到极端的观点是资产阶级的观点，是资产阶级那种以自我为中心的个人主义世界观的表现。资本主义社会是人类历史中最后的一个、也是发展得最充分的一个私有制的社会，因此，建立在私有制基础上的个人主义的世界观，在这个社会中达到了登峰造极的地步。在这里个人主义的世界观是一种占统治地位的世界观，这种世界观贯穿在各个意识形态的领域内，也表现在对各种问题的看法上。当着资产阶级带着他们的个人主义世界观这种有色眼镜来看自由这个问题时，就一定会把自由说成是绝对的，说成是随心所欲的。此外，资产阶级之所以需要这样一种自由观，是因为他们要利用它来为其“自由”地剥削和榨取劳动人民，“自由”地掠夺、奴役殖民地人民，“自由”地燃烧起侵略的战火的行为进行辩护。
    小资产阶级也喜欢把自由说成是绝对的，无条件的，这是因为小资产阶级的经济基础也是私有制，同时小资产阶级（主要是小生产者）的经济活动是单独地、分散地进行的，这就使他们养成了一种自由散漫的习惯，这种习惯使得他们对于任何约束、任何纪律都感到格格不入。此外，在资本主义社会中，小资产阶级处于一种不稳定的经济地位，他们在濒于破产的时候，往往会产生一种绝望的心理，而无政府主义就是这种“绝望的产物”。（列宁全集第五卷第294页），无政府主义所宣扬的基本观点之一恰恰就是个人的“绝对自由”。这种基于个人主义的世界观实质上也是资产阶级的世界观。
    无产阶级决不会有个人“绝对自由”的思想，因为他们的生产活动是一种联合的活动，当他们是孤零零的个人时，他们是没有力量的，生产也没有办法进行；而在革命斗争中，他们也必须要有坚强的组织。因此，无产阶级有着高度的集体主义精神，他们总是把自己看成是整个阶级这个伟大机体中的一分子，从不把个人的自由强调成为不受任何约束的随心所欲的行为。问题很明显：把自由看成是相对的、有条件的，还是绝对的、无条件的，本质上是两种对立的世界观的表现，前者是无产阶级的世界观的表现，后者是资产阶级的世界观的表现。
    在目前的过渡时期，既然存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争，也就存在着无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的斗争，而这种斗争也必然在党内得到反映。1959年在党内进行的反对右倾机会主义的斗争，就是最好的证明。党内有这样一小撮人，他们或者是出身非无产阶级，思想没有彻底改造，或者是受了资产阶级的影响而思想蜕化；他们虽然在组织上入了党，但仍保留着资产阶级的世界观；他们敌视无产阶级的纪律，歌颂资产阶级的所谓自由，在某种情况下，并发展为对党的进攻。他们很像列宁所形容过的孟什维克机会主义者那样：“党的组织在他们看来是凶恶可怕的工厂；部分服从整体和少数服从多数的原则在他们看来是‘农奴制’……他们一听见在中央领导下实行分工，就发出可怜又可笑的嚎叫，反对把人们变成‘小轮子和小螺丝钉’……他们一听见有人提起党的组织章程，就作出瞧不起人的样子，发表鄙视的（对‘形式主义者’）意见，说完全不要章程也可以。”（列宁全集第7卷，第386页）他们不但在政治路线上与我们有根本的分歧，在组织路线上也与我们有根本的分歧，他们反对民主集中制的组织原则，妄想以资产阶级的极端自由的观点来改造我们的党，为资本主义的复辟奠定组织上的基础。
    在党内还有一些同志，虽然不像以上所说的那种人一样敌视党的组织，但是由于他们也或多或少的沾染上了这种资产阶级的自由观，因此对纪律和自由也缺乏正确的认识，有的人往往感到组织生活不自由，有的人认为在战争时期需要纪律，现在和平建设时期可以松一点了，不必再有严格的纪律。他们不懂得民主和集中，自由和纪律“这些都是一个统一体的两个矛盾着的侧面，它们是矛盾的，又是统一的，我们不应当片面地强调某一个侧面而否定另一个侧面。”（关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，第6页）不懂得“党是一个战斗的组织，没有集中统一的指挥，是不可能取得任何战斗胜利的。”（中国共产党第八次全国代表大会文献，第91页）不仅进行阶级斗争，战胜阶级敌人是如此，就是进行建设，征服自然也是如此。况且目前在我国阶级斗争并没有熄灭，在复杂的阶级斗争中，资产阶级的世界观、资产阶级、小资产阶级的习惯势力不可避免地会反映到工人阶级和共产党的内部来，这些东西就好像是一种腐蚀剂，当它在党内发生作用时，就会腐蚀党内的统一和团结。因此，在社会主义建设时期，党的纪律不能有丝毫的削弱。
    党的纪律决不排除党内有充分的自由、民主，党内的集中是民主基础上的集中。党章上规定每一个党员可以在党的会议上或者在党的报刊上参加关于党的政策的理论和实际问题的自由的、切实的讨论；可以对党的工作提出建议，在工作中充分发挥创造性；可以在党的会议上批评党的任何组织和任何工作人员；对于党的决议如果有不同意的地方，除了无条件地执行以外，可以保留和向党的领导机关提出自己的意见；可以向党的任何一级组织直到中央委员会提出声明、申诉和控诉等等。当然，党内的自由是有领导的自由，党内的民主是集中指导下的民主，任何利用党内的自由、民主来进行违背党的利益的活动都是不允许的。邓小平同志在修改党章的报告中说：“一切发展党内民主的措施都不是为了削弱党的必需的集中，而是为了给它以强大的生气勃勃的基础。”（八大文献第91页）党的纪律主要靠什么来维持和巩固？主要要依靠全体党员的自觉来维持和巩固。不错，既然是纪律，就总是带有一定的强制性，但是，如果每一个党员不是真正地觉悟到党的团结、党的统一对于党的事业实现的重大意义，不是真正地自觉遵守党的纪律，那么纪律本身尽管严格，但不可能是强有力的。
    我们每一个人都必须清除资产阶级的个人主义的自由观，坚决地树立起无产阶级的世界观。只有这样，我们的自觉性才会大大提高，才会不至于感到纪律的存在是一种“束缚”，相反，会感到纪律的存在是维护党的团结、党的统一，从而也是保证党的事业无往而不胜所必需的。当我们有了这样一种觉悟，真正养成一种自觉遵守纪律的习惯时，我们就会在党的生活中得到最充分的自由。
