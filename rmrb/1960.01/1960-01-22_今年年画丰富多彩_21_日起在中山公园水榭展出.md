Xinhua News Agency, January 21st. The New Year pictures, deeply loved by the masses, are even more splendid this year. Whether in content or form, they are richer, more colorful, more beautiful, and more moving than in previous years.

The "New Year Picture Exhibition" organized by the Chinese Artists Association will begin today at the Water Pavilion in Zhongshan Park. The 179 types and 219 pieces of New Year pictures on display were carefully selected from a large number of New Year pictures published in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Weixian County of Shandong, and Taohuawu of Suzhou. The themes of the New Year pictures are quite extensive, including those praising the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, such as "Beside Chairman Mao"; those depicting the happy lives of the people, such as "Trying on New Clothes"; those showing the Great Leap Forward in production, such as "Picture of Many Treasures"; those promoting the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and also some landscapes, flowers, plants, and opera stories.

The exhibited New Year pictures have diverse artistic styles, filled with a strong atmosphere of life and the colors of revolutionary romanticism. The New Year pictures from Weixian County, Shandong, aroused great interest among the audience with their simple and beautiful folk flavor. The formats of the New Year pictures include door paintings, calendar paintings, hanging tags, four-panel screens, large "Fu" (good fortune) characters, and comic strips. The types of paintings include traditional Chinese painting, oil painting, pastel painting, watercolor painting, and paper-cutting. Printing technology has also improved. In addition to offset printing, there is also woodblock printing. It can be seen from the exhibited New Year pictures that China's New Year pictures have achieved a leap forward in the past year, presenting a prosperous scene. It is particularly gratifying that a large number of mass authors and new forces have emerged in various regions.
