The application to join the commune, enshrined in a glass display case, holds a stack of bright red silk, upon which the indelible names of hundreds of millions of strong, capable hands are recorded. Listen, to the drums resounding across the land; behold, the red flags fluttering in the sky. The people's commune is born, and it is all recorded here. Don't laugh at the crooked, slanted characters, don't criticize the dense, packed intervals; these people applying to join the commune are creating a glorious history!

People's Commune Industry Pavilion: "This is petroleum—the blood of machines; this is steel smelted in backyard furnaces; these are parts made from backyard steel, used to support large-scale industry... These are canned specialties for export, these are rubber shoes made from sweet potatoes, these are soundproof, moisture-proof fiberboards, made from bark, rice straw, and sorghum stalks..." Colorful, diverse, like the butterflies of the Erhai Lake's Third Month Fair! One can't take in all the brilliance of labor and wisdom; the visiting crowds chatter with laughter: "It's truly unprecedented, an agricultural exhibition showcasing industry. The people's commune is just one year old, and the miracle has spread throughout the land... Can't you see it yet? How the gap between town and country will be eliminated! Can't you imagine? The happy and prosperous years to come..."

The commune members' poetry collections are full of poetic and artistic expression. Look at these dazzling poetry collections! No need to laboriously leaf through each one, copying down the titles alone is good poetry: "The Sun Rises, the Sky Turns Red," "Green Mountains Everywhere," "Forty Roads Paved to Prosperity," "The Song of the Great Leap Forward Like a Sea Tide." "Commune Members Outdo the Immortals," "Breaking Rocks and Splitting Mountains," "People Change Their Thinking, the Land Changes Its Appearance," "One Step Across Nine Heavens." "The Peasants Are of One Mind with the Party," "The People's World is Evergreen," "The Land Yields More, the People Live Longer," "A Bright Future Lies Ahead"... Every word sparkles with the light of the Great Leap Forward, every line sings of surging willpower; paradise is right here on earth, there is no end to the poetry of the commune members.

    农展会散歌

   入社申请书镶着玻璃的展览柜里，摆着一叠鲜红的绸子，亿万只粗壮有力的大手，留下涂抹不掉的名字。请听，遍地轰鸣的锣鼓，请看，漫天飘扬的红旗，人民公社从此诞生，一切全都记录在这里。别笑字体歪歪斜斜，莫说间隔麻麻密密；这些申请入社的人们，正在创造着辉煌的历史！
  人民公社工业馆“这是石油——机器的血液，这是土炉炼出的钢铁，这是土钢铁制成的零件，用来支援大型工业……这是出口的特产罐头，这是甘薯变成的胶鞋，这是隔音、防潮的纤维板，原料是树皮、稻草和秫秸……”五彩缤纷，百花齐放，像洱海三月三的蝴蝶！看不尽劳动和智慧的光泽，参观的人群笑语唼喋：“真是破天荒的事情，农展会上展出工业，人民公社刚满一岁，神话已传遍三山五岳……难道你还看不到吗？城乡的差别将怎样消灭！难道你还想像不出？未来幸福美好的年月……”
    社员的诗集生活里充满了诗情画意，看这琳琅满目的诗集！不用费神逐本翻阅，抄下书名也是好诗：《太阳出来满天红》，《山山油绿处处青》，《四十条铺起康庄道》，《跃进歌声像海潮》。《社员赛过活神仙》，《打开岩石劈开山》，《人换思想地换装》，《一步跨过九重天》。《农民和党一条心》，《人民天下万年青》，《土地增产人增寿》，《美好远景在前头》……字字闪着跃进的光辉，句句唱出风发的意志；天堂就在人间世上，写不尽的是公社社员的诗。
