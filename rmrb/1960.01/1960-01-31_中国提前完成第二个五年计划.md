    New reports of outstanding achievements by the people of the socialist camp in economic and cultural construction arrive every day.

    The Soviet Union has completed the first year of the Seven-Year Plan. The economies of all People's Democratic countries are developing smoothly. On the whole, the industrial production of socialist countries has increased more than fourfold compared to the pre-war period. High speed - this is the common law of socialism, and the economy of the entire socialist system fully confirms this.

    Recently, Xinhua News Agency in Beijing released a press communiqué on the development of China's national economy in 1959. The materials in the communiqué show that the total output value of China's industry and agriculture increased by 31.1% compared to 1958.

    The output of major industrial and agricultural products in 1959 and their growth rates compared to 1958 are as follows: steel (excluding native steel) reached 13.35 million tons, an increase of 67% over 1958; raw coal reached 347.8 million tons, an increase of 29%; power generation reached 41.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 51%; crude oil reached 3.7 million tons, an increase of 63.4%; grain reached 540.1 billion jin, an increase of 8%; cotton reached 48.2 million dan, an increase of 14.76%.

    In 1959, 1,341 large construction projects were under construction, of which 671 were completed or partially completed and put into production.

    These are the main results of the economic development of the People's Republic of China in 1959. As pointed out in the Xinhua News Agency communiqué, these achievements have enabled the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the People's Republic of China from 1958 to 1962, proposed by the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in September 1956, to be completed three years ahead of schedule.

    The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized that the Second Five-Year Plan is an important key to realizing the general task of the transition period of the People's China. The proposal of the Congress pointed out: "The Second Five-Year Plan must, on the basis of the victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan, promote socialist construction and complete socialist transformation with both positive and steady steps, ensuring that our country will be able to basically build a complete industrial system in about three five-year plans, so that our country can be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country."

    The Second Five-Year Plan of the People's Republic of China stipulates that the total output value of industry and agriculture should increase by approximately 75% in 1962 compared to 1957, while it increased by 94.4% in 1959. This plan stipulates that the total industrial output value should increase by approximately one time, while it increased by 1.3 times in 1959. The plan stipulates that the total agricultural output value should increase by approximately 35%, and it has now increased by 45.8%. The national income in 1959 increased by 62.9% compared to 1957, while the Five-Year Plan stipulated an increase of 50%.

    The production of major industrial and agricultural products in 1959 has reached or exceeded the targets stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan for 1962. For example, steel production in 1959 was 13.35 million tons, while the original plan stipulated 10.5 million to 12 million tons in 1962; coal mining in 1959 was 347.8 million tons, while the original plan stipulated a production of 190 million to 210 million tons in 1962; metallurgical equipment production was 205,000 tons, while the original plan stipulated 30,000 to 40,000 tons in 1962; power generation equipment production was 2.15 million kilowatts, while the original plan stipulated 1.4 million to 1.5 million kilowatts in 1962; metal cutting machine tool production was 70,000 units, while the stipulated production for 1962 was 60,000 to 65,000 units; grain production was 540.1 billion jin, while the stipulated production for 1962 was 500 billion jin.

    Last year, the labor productivity of workers in the industrial sector increased by 15.5%. The production of tens of thousands of new products was mastered. The costs of all sectors of the national economy have been reduced, of which the industrial sector has reduced by 6%.

    Along with the great economic development, education, science, and culture have also been greatly developed. The cultural revolution in the People's Republic of China has been widely unfolded. The total number of students in universities and colleges reached 810,000, which is close to the target of 850,000 to be reached in 1962 originally set by the Second Five-Year Plan. The number of students in various types of secondary schools reached 12.9 million, and the number of primary school students reached 90 million.

    The network of scientific research institutions, universities and colleges, economic departments, and scientific research institutions in enterprises has been greatly expanded. Publishing, broadcasting, film, and drama have all developed rapidly. Great achievements have been made in sports and health.

    The material living standards of the Chinese people are constantly improving. In 1959, the average wage of workers and staff (excluding new employees) increased by approximately 5% compared to 1958. The state's labor insurance funds, medical expenses, welfare expenses, and other similar expenditures for workers and staff increased by more than 16% compared to 1958. The average income of commune members in rural people's communes increased by approximately 10% compared to 1958.

    These are the main materials of the People's Republic of China's early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan.

    If the victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan enabled the People's Republic of China to carry out the great socialist transformation, consolidate the socialist relations of production in urban and rural areas, and lay the foundation for national industrialization, then the early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan can guarantee the further upsurge of China's national economy, culture, and people's welfare, and enable China to stride forward on the road to becoming a powerful industrialized country.

    The early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan by the People's Republic of China once again convincingly demonstrates how infinite and great the power of the liberated Chinese people is. The great Lenin believed that this power had great significance, and Lenin firmly believed in the creative talents of the Chinese and the entire Eastern people. These forces were awakened by the great October Socialist Revolution and the achievements of socialism in the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp with world-historical significance.

    The victory of the Chinese people in completing the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule once again vividly shows what infinite creative talents the socialist system has awakened in the Chinese people, who, not long ago, were in a state of poverty and backwardness like other people in the East.

    Comrade Khrushchev said at the grand reception in Beijing celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "There is no need to explain too much here. Practical life proves the great superiority of socialism. Now, the vigorous development of socialist countries is unstoppable, and such development makes the capitalist chiefs panic. They admit that the example of the victorious advance of the great People's China in developing industry, agriculture, and culture is exerting a huge influence on Asian and African countries. Seeing the victorious advance of the People's China, the people of other countries are eager to learn and hope to achieve equally great achievements, but the enemies of socialism are panic-stricken because of this, and worry about the fate of capitalism.

    Now, everyone recognizes the achievements made by the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. The people of Asian and African countries see what road and what system should be taken to truly give full play to the talents and creativity of the people, and to allow the people to fully and completely display their incomparably powerful creative power."

    The early completion of the Second Five-Year Plan by the People's Republic of China is a huge contribution of the Chinese people to strengthening the cause of peace. The People's Republic of China cooperates closely with all socialist countries, strengthens the unity and power of the socialist camp, carries out unremitting struggles for peace and security, and provides fraternal assistance to oppressed nations striving for freedom and independence. The prestige of the People's Republic of China as a world power is increasing day by day on the international stage.

    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "In the international arena, our victorious gains have relied on the support of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the deep sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world. Now, the development of the international situation is even more favorable to our country's construction. Our country and all socialist countries need peace, and the people of all countries in the world also need peace. Those who desire war and do not want peace are only some monopoly capitalist groups in a few imperialist countries who rely on aggression to make a fortune. Due to the continuous efforts of peace-loving countries and people, the international situation has tended to ease. In order to strive for lasting world peace, we must further develop friendly cooperation with fraternal countries in the socialist camp and strengthen unity with all peace-loving countries."

    The big family of socialist countries is a reliable pillar of universal peace and progress, and the most powerful force in the world on which all mankind places its hopes. Socialist countries have a vital interest in maintaining lasting international peace. They consistently fight against the threat of war. Strengthening world peace and ensuring the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems is the general line of the diplomatic policy of socialist countries.

    The achievements of every fraternal country are strengthening the power and might of the entire socialist camp. The cooperation and mutual assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries are also an extremely important source of the rapid economic development of socialist countries. The socialist road guarantees the elimination of the differences in economic and cultural levels between countries left over from the old system. In the short historical period in which socialism has existed as a world system, the economic development of the countries united in this system has greatly tended to balance. Socialist countries will transition to communism at roughly the same time. The realization of this process is not through lowering the speed of economically highly developed countries, but through making the less developed countries have a higher development speed.

    The Chinese people attribute all their victories to the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, under whose leadership the Chinese people liberated their country, smoothly carried out democratic reforms, completed the restoration of the national economy, carried out socialist transformation, and are advancing confidently on the road to transforming China into a great industrialized socialist country.

    The Soviet people are happy for the achievements of their Chinese brothers. The firm bond of eternal friendship, the common goal of fighting for socialism and communism, unites the people of our two countries. The Soviet people, who were the first to establish a socialist society in history, fully understand the complexity and importance of the tasks that the Chinese people have to solve. We firmly believe in the strength and wisdom of the Chinese working people.

    Khrushchev said in Beijing: "Our people have embarked on a broad and bright road, and they are full of infinite energy. For the billion people who have already abandoned the shackles of capitalist slavery, there is no task that they cannot accomplish. We are moving towards our sacred goal, deeply convinced of the righteousness of our common cause, and closely united into a unified team. This unity under the never-fading brilliance of Marxism-Leninism is our great achievement, and we will protect this achievement like the apple of our eye."

    The Soviet people sincerely wish the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and all working people of the People's Republic of China greater achievements in completing the magnificent tasks of socialist construction and in the cause of fighting for world peace.

    中国提前完成第二个五年计划
    苏联“真理报”编辑部文章
    每一天都有关于社会主义阵营各国人民在经济和文化建设方面获得卓越成就的新的捷报传来。
    苏联已经完成了七年计划的第一年计划。所有人民民主国家的经济都在顺利地发展。社会主义国家的工业生产总的说来比战前时期增加了四倍多。高速度——这是社会主义的共同规律，整个社会主义体系的经济完全证实了这一点。
    最近在北京公布了新华社关于中华人民共和国1959年国民经济发展情况的新闻公报。公报的材料表明，中国工农业的总产值比1958年增加了31．1％。
    1959年工农业主要产品的产量及其与1958年相比的增长率如下：钢（不包括土钢）达到一千三百三十五万吨，比1958年增长67％；原煤达到三亿四千七百八十万吨，增长29％；发电量达到四百一十五亿度，增长51％；原油达到三百七十万吨，增长63．4％；粮食达到五千四百零一亿斤，增长8％；棉花达到四千八百二十万担，增长14．76％。
    1959年，有一千三百四十一个大的工程项目施工建设，其中全部建成和部分建成而投入生产的有六百七十一个。
    这就是中华人民共和国1959年经济发展的主要结果。正如新华社新闻公报所指出的，这些成就使得1956年9月中国共产党第八次全国代表大会第一次会议所提出的1958—1962年中华人民共和国发展国民经济第二个五年计划的主要指标得以提前三年完成。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会着重指出，第二个五年计划是实现人民中国过渡时期总任务的重要关键。代表大会的建议指出：“第二个五年计划，必须在第一个五年计划胜利完成的基础上，以既积极又稳妥可靠的步骤，推进社会主义的建设和完成社会主义的改造，保证我国有可能大约经过三个五年计划的时间，基本上建成一个完整的工业体系，使我国能够由落后的农业国变为先进的社会主义工业国。”
    中华人民共和国第二个五年计划规定，工农业总产值在1962年应当比1957年大约增加75％，而在1959年就增加了94．4％。这个计划规定工业总产值大约增加一倍，而在1959年就增加了一点三倍。农业总产值计划规定大约增加35％，而现在已经增加了45．8％。1959年国民收入比1957年增加了62．9％，而五年计划规定增加50％。
    1959年主要工农业产品的生产已经达到了或者已超过了第二个五年计划规定在1962年所要达到的指标，例如，钢产量在1959年为一千三百三十五万吨，而原计划规定在1962年为一千零五十万至一千二百万吨；煤的开采量在1959年为三亿四千七百八十万吨，而原计划规定的1962年的产量为一亿九千万至两亿一千万吨；冶金设备的产量为二十万五千吨，而原计划规定的1962年的产量为三万至四万吨；发电设备的产量为二百一十五万瓩，而原计划规定的1962年的产量为一百四十万至一百五十万瓩；金属切削机床的产量为七万台，而规定的1962年产量为六万至六万五千台；粮食产量为五千四百零一亿斤，而规定的1962年的产量为五千亿斤。
    去年工业部门工人的劳动生产率提高了15．5％。掌握了几万种新产品的生产。国民经济各部门的成本都降低了，其中工业部门降低了6％。
    在经济大发展的同时，教育、科学和文化也得到了大发展。中华人民共和国的文化革命广泛展开。高等学校的学生总人数达到了八十一万人，即接近第二个五年计划原订1962年要达到的八十五万人的指标。各类中等学校的学生人数达到了一千二百九十万人，小学学生人数达到了九千万人。
    科学研究机构、高等学校、经济部门和企业中的科学研究机构网大大扩大了。出版事业、广播事业、电影和戏剧都有了迅速的发展。体育运动和保健事业取得了很大的成就。
    中国人民的物质生活水平在不断提高。1959年职工的平均工资（不包括新职工）比1958年大约增加5％。国家用于职工的劳动保险金、医药费和福利费及其他类似的支出比1958年增加了16％以上。农村人民公社社员的平均收入比1958年大约增加10％。
    这就是中华人民共和国提前完成第二个五年计划的主要材料。
    如果说由于胜利完成第一个五年计划，中华人民共和国得以进行伟大的社会主义改造，在城市和乡村巩固地确立了社会主义生产关系，为国家工业化奠定了基础，那么，提前完成第二个五年计划就可以保证中国国民经济、文化、人民福利的进一步高涨，并使中国在变为强大的工业国家的道路上阔步迈进。
    中华人民共和国提前完成第二个五年计划再一次令人信服地表明，解放了的中国人民的力量是多么无穷无尽，是多么伟大。伟大的列宁认为这种力量具有巨大的意义，列宁毫不动摇地相信中国和整个东方人民的创造才能。这些力量是被伟大的十月社会主义革命以及社会主义在苏联和整个社会主义阵营中取得的具有世界历史意义的成就所唤醒的。
    中国人民在提前完成第二个五年计划方面的胜利又一次鲜明地表明，社会主义制度在中国人民当中唤起何等无穷无尽的创造才能，而中国人民不久以前还像东方其他国家人民一样处于贫困落后状态。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在北京庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年的盛大招待会上说过：“在这里不需要作过多的说明。实际生活就证明了社会主义的伟大优越性。现在，社会主义国家的蓬勃发展是不可阻挡的，这样的发展使得资本主义的头目们惊慌失措。他们承认，伟大的人民中国在发展工业、农业和文化方面胜利前进的例子正在给予亚非各国以巨大的影响。看到人民中国的胜利前进，其他国家的人民都很想学习，希望取得同样巨大的成就，但是，社会主义的敌人却因此恐慌万状，为资本主义的命运担忧。
    现在，大家都公认中国人民和中国共产党所取得的成就。亚非各国人民看到，应当走什么道路和采取什么制度才能真正地发挥出人民的才能和创造力，才能让人民全面地和充分地显示他们强大无比的创造力量。”
    中华人民共和国提前完成第二个五年计划是中国人民对加强和平事业的巨大贡献。中华人民共和国同所有社会主义国家密切合作，加强社会主义阵营的团结和威力，为和平和安全进行不懈的斗争，对争取自由和独立的被压迫民族给予兄弟般的援助。中华人民共和国作为世界大国的威信在国际舞台上日益提高。
    毛泽东同志在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上指出：“在国际范围内，我们胜利的获得，是依靠了以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的支持，以及全世界爱好和平的人民的深厚同情。现在，国际形势的发展对于我国的建设事业是更加有利了。我国和各社会主义国家都需要和平，世界各国的人民也都需要和平。渴望战争、不要和平的，仅仅是少数帝国主义国家中的某些依靠侵略发财的垄断资本集团。由于爱好和平的国家和人民的不断努力，国际的局势已经趋向和缓。为了争取世界的持久和平，我们必须进一步地发展同社会主义阵营中各个兄弟国家的友好合作，并且同一切爱好和平的国家加强团结。”
    社会主义国家大家庭是普遍和平与进步的可靠的支柱，是全人类寄予希望的、世界上最强大的力量。社会主义国家对维护国际持久和平有切身的利害关系。它们始终如一地为反对战争威胁而斗争。加强世界和平、保证不同社会制度的国家和平共处，是社会主义国家外交政策的总路线。
    每一个兄弟国家的成就都在增强整个社会主义阵营的力量和威力。苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的合作和互助，也是社会主义国家经济迅速发展的极其重要的源泉。社会主义道路保证消除旧制度所遗留下来的各国之间经济和文化水平的差异。在社会主义作为一个世界体系存在的短短的历史时期中，团结在这个体系中的各国的经济发展已经大大趋向平衡。社会主义国家将大致同时过渡到共产主义。这个过程的实现不是通过降低经济高度发展的国家的速度，而是通过使经济较不发展的国家有更高的发展速度。
    中国人民把自己的一切胜利归功于光荣的共产党的领导，中国人民在共产党的领导下解放了自己的国家，顺利地进行了民主改革，完成了国民经济的恢复，进行了社会主义改造，并且在把中国变为伟大的工业化的社会主义国家的道路上满怀信心地前进。
    苏联人民为中国兄弟的成就感到高兴。永恒友谊的牢固纽带，为社会主义和共产主义而斗争的共同目的，把我们两国人民联结在一起。第一个在历史上建立起社会主义社会的苏联人民，十分了解中国人民所要解决的任务的复杂和重大。我们坚定地相信中国劳动人民的力量和智慧。
    赫鲁晓夫在北京说过：“我们的人民走上了广阔和光明的大道，他们充满着无穷的精力。对于已经抛弃资本主义奴役枷锁的十亿人民来说，没有什么任务是他们所不能胜任的。我们正在走向自己神圣的目标，深信我们共同事业的正义性，紧密地团结成为一支统一的队伍。在马克思列宁主义永不熄灭的光辉照耀下的这种团结是我们的伟大成果，我们将像保护眼珠一样地保护这个成果。”
    苏联人衷心地预祝中华人民共和国工人、农民、知识分子、全体劳动人民在完成社会主义建设的宏伟任务方面，在为世界和平而斗争的事业中获得更大的成就。　（原载1月29日真理报）（新华社）
