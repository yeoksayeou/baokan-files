The British economy, after stagnating for three years and shrinking for one, began to recover partially last year. However, this recovery is based on extremely unstable foundations, and the basic situation has not improved. The industrial production indices for the first, second, and third quarters were 108, 110, and 113, respectively (with 1954 as 100). The fourth quarter is estimated to be around 113 to 114, meaning that the overall industrial production index for the year only increased by about five points compared to the recession year of 1958. This rate of increase cannot be compared to the rapid development speed of socialist countries, and it is also filled with deep contradictions.

The recovery of British production is partial and distorted. The consumer goods industry, especially the durable consumer goods industry, has recovered significantly, while the pillar industry of the national economy—heavy industry—remains in a state of depression or semi-depression. The coal industry has not only failed to increase production but has also reduced it. As of November 1959, coal production was down 4% compared to the same period last year. The coal crisis is mainly due to the slump in other coal-consuming industries. The steel industry remains at the 1958 level, with steel production for the first ten months of last year at 19.93 million tons, only 400,000 tons more than the same period in 1958. Pig iron production was even lower than in 1958, down 500,000 tons. Demand for steel has only increased in the automotive industry, with no signs of increase in the railway, coal mining, and shipbuilding industries.

In the heavy machinery industry, industries such as aircraft, shipbuilding, and railway freight cars are still in a slump, with production capacity only used at 70%-80%, and the level of orders remains low.

The sectors with larger production increases are mostly consumer industries, such as automobiles, chemicals, clothing, electrical equipment, and other durable goods, as well as some new industrial products. According to a survey report by the "National Institute of Economic and Social Research," the output of the eighty-nine steel companies it surveyed increased by 10% from July 1958 to November 1959. However, this increase was entirely due to a 20% increase in automobile production and a 50% increase in electrical machinery production.

Since the recovery and so-called "prosperity" of British production are almost entirely limited to the consumer sector, its foundation is narrow.

The recovery of British production began after three years of stagnation and one year of decline. The stagnation and contraction of production led to a decline in some inventory materials, thus creating the necessity and possibility for increased replenishment. The British government's artificial stimulus and expansion of debt played a special role in this economic recovery. At the end of the previous year and the beginning of last year, the British government took a series of measures to "limit" the development of the economic crisis. At the end of the previous year, it relaxed bank loans and abolished restrictions on installment purchases. In April last year, the budget also reduced some direct and indirect taxes. Due to the abolition of the rent law, private housing construction investment also increased to some extent. These measures stimulated an increase in market demand, creating a temporary false "prosperity." According to statistics from the London "Financial Times," from October 1958 to October 1959, the installment debt of the British people alone increased from 490 million pounds to 807 million pounds, almost doubling.

What the British government finds very difficult about the current British economy is that the growth of several consumer goods has not led to a significant increase in fixed investment. The increase in production has only used part of the surplus production capacity. But the real recovery of the economy depends on the renewal of fixed investment. Currently, fixed investment in some major sectors in the UK has not only not increased significantly, but has even decreased in the first three quarters of last year compared with the same period of the previous year.

Foreign trade has a particularly important meaning in the British economy. Part of the reason for the production recovery last year was due to the increase in foreign trade. In the first eleven months of last year, exports increased by 4.5% compared to the same period last year, returning to the 1957 level of foreign exports. Exports to North America increased by 25% compared to the same period last year; increased 26% in September and October. On the one hand, this is due to the partial recovery of the US economy, which facilitated the import of British goods. On the other hand, during the US steelworkers' strike, Britain saw an opportunity and stepped up its exports to North America; this is also one of the reasons. British exports to Western Europe also increased by 7% in the first eight months of last year, increasing 18% in September and October. However, British exports to the Sterling Area decreased by 7% in the first eight months of last year compared to the same period last year. It only increased by 10% in September and October. The fundamental reason is that the development of the 1957-1958 economic crisis and the sharp drop in raw material prices greatly frustrated the purchasing power of the Sterling Area countries. It was not until the end of 1959 that the raw material exports of the Sterling Area countries increased, and imports began to improve slightly. However, the British economy was able to improve not only because trade had increased, but also because the terms of trade were favorable to Britain. After the international raw material prices fell in 1957, they failed to recover and remained at a low level; industrial products, however, were able to maintain their monopoly prices. At the beginning of last year, the raw material price index was 99 (1954 was 100), falling to 96 in April and only returning to 99 in October. The price of industrial products was 109 during the same period and has maintained this high level. The scissors difference between industrial and agricultural product prices not only allows Britain to shift the consequences of the crisis to the people of economically backward countries, but also allows Britain to continue to use this ill-gotten wealth to revitalize its domestic economy and relatively improve the status of the pound in the capitalist world. Last year, Britain not only repaid the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a debt of US$200 million, but also subscribed to US$162 million of shares in the organization. In October, it "five and a half years ahead of schedule" settled the more than US$250 million debt to the Export-Import Bank incurred during the Suez aggression war. In addition, it also partially relaxed the free convertibility of the pound and restrictions on imports of goods from the dollar area. The British economy has been able to recover only by relying on the exploitation and unequal exchange of economically backward countries in the Sterling Area and relying on certain temporarily effective factors. There are already signs that these factors are losing their effect. Artificially stimulating consumption and expanding debt are becoming less effective. Personal consumption expenditure has been leveling off since the third quarter of last year. Currently, many heavy machinery industries still have about 20% of idle equipment capacity, so the increase in industrial investment will not be large. Investment in individual industrial sectors may increase slightly, mainly in the consumer industry, but it cannot change the situation of overall industrial investment. As a result of debt repayment, the pound's reserves at the end of 1959 decreased by US$333 million compared to the end of 1958. Currently, it only has a total of US$2.736 billion, accounting for less than 6% of the total reserves of the capitalist world, but the pound bears 40% of the trade settlement in the capitalist world. Therefore, the risk of the pound is still very high. The British economic recovery has not only failed to solve the contradictions that caused the crisis, but on the contrary, these contradictions have developed on a larger scale.

(1) The contradiction between production and consumption has intensified. On the one hand, the industry still has a large amount of surplus equipment capacity. On the other hand, due to the increase in the cost of living, the actual income of workers has decreased. After repeated "stimulations," purchasing power has become exhausted. Domestic class contradictions are very sharp. It is particularly worth noting that the increase in production this time comes from the increase in individual labor productivity. In other words, it is due to the strengthening of workers' labor intensity and the automation of certain industrial sectors. The index of output per person in the third quarter of the previous year was 104 (1954 as 100). The third quarter of last year was 111, an increase of seven points from a year ago. However, although production has increased, the number of unemployed has not decreased significantly. According to official materials, the number of unemployed in November last year was more than 410,000. As of September last year, the number of employed people in the UK was 130,000 fewer than the highest point in 1957. The existence of massive unemployment further reduces social purchasing power.

(2) The intensification of the contradiction of international monopoly capital vying for the market. The United States is in a predicament of balance of payments, and dollars are flowing out, trying to take all measures to expand its exports. Due to US pressure, Britain has had to abolish many import restrictions on dollar goods. The formation of the European "Common Market," which is directly opposed to Britain, will make it more difficult for Britain to export to Western Europe. West Germany and Japan have gained the upper hand in competing for the international market. The share of the UK in industrial exports in the capitalist world is declining. In 1950, it was 25.6%, and in 1955, it fell to 19.7%. In the third quarter of last year, it even fell to 16.8%.

(3) The fall in international raw material prices has reduced the purchasing power of raw material countries, thereby partially limiting the increase in British exports. It is estimated that the fall in raw material prices has caused raw material countries to lose more than 500 million pounds.

(4) The contradiction between developing production and maintaining fiscal and financial stability. Britain has huge overseas investments, and the City of London is the financial center of the British Empire. The rise and fall of the pound price affects the economic system of the British Empire. Maintaining the stability of the pound has always been the guiding ideology of British economic policy. However, to develop production, it is bound to expand imports. The increase in imports means the outflow of gold and dollar reserves. This is how the past few crises have occurred. At the end of last year, British production had a little development, and the trade deficit expanded. Fearing the occurrence of a financial crisis, the British government often takes some measures to restrict production. Fiscal finance and production restrict each other, which determines that British production cannot have major development.

Therefore, it is not surprising that the "Financial Times," the mouthpiece of British monopoly capital, is warning that the growth rate of British industrial production in 1960 will be lower than in 1959, and is worried that Britain may experience another international payment crisis.

    一年来的英国经济
    李一川
    英国经济在停滞了三年、萎缩了一年之后，于去年开始有了部分的回升。但这种回升，基础极不稳定，基本情况并无改善。第一、二、三季度的工业生产指数各为一百零八、一百一十、一百一十三（以1954年为一百）。第四季度大约为一百一十三到一百一十四，这就是说，全年工业生产指数比经济衰退的1958年大约只上升了五点左右。这种上升的速度，不但根本不能同社会主义国家生产一日千里的发展速度相比，并且还充满着深刻的矛盾。
    英国生产的回升是局部的、畸形的。消费品工业，特别是耐用消费品工业回升幅度较大，而国民经济的支柱工业——重工业则仍处于萧条或半萧条状态。煤炭工业不仅没有增产，而且还减产。到1959年11月止，煤产量比前年同期减产4％。煤业危机基本上是由于其他用煤业的萧条造成的。钢铁工业仍停留在1958年的水平上，去年头十个月的钢产量为一千九百九十三万吨，比1958年同期只增加四十万吨。生铁产量则比1958年还低，比1958年减产五十万吨。对钢铁的需求，只是汽车业有所增加，铁路、煤矿、造船业仍无增加迹象。
    在重机械工业中，像飞机、造船、铁路货车等工业仍然处于不景气中，生产能力只使用到70％—80％，进货的水平也仍然很低。
    生产增加较多的部门，大部分为消费工业，像汽车、化学品、衣物、电气设备及其他耐用品和工业上某些新产品。据“英国国家经济与社会研究所”的调查报告说：它所调查的八十九家用钢公司，从1958年7月到1959年11月产量增加了10％。但是这种增加完全是由于汽车增产了20％，电气机械增产50％的结果。
    由于英国生产的回升和所谓“繁荣”，几乎完全限于消费部门，它的基础是狭窄的。
    英国生产开始回升是经过三年停滞和一年倒退之后出现的。生产的停顿和减缩引起了部分库存物资的下降，因而有了增加补充的必要和可能。英国政府用人为刺激和扩大负债的办法加大了需求，在这次经济回升中起了它特别的作用。英国政府在前年底和去年初采取了一系列的措施来“限制”经济危机的发展。前年底放松了银行贷款，取消赊购的限制。去年4月份又在预算中减收了一部分直接税和间接税。由于废除房租法案，私人房屋建筑投资也有部分增加。这些措施刺激了市场上需求的增加，造成一时的虚假“繁荣”。据伦敦“金融时报”统计，从1958年10月到1959年10月，仅仅英国人民的分期付款债务就从四亿九千万英镑增加到八亿零七百万英镑，几乎增加了一倍。
    英国政府对目前英国经济感到非常棘手的是：几种消费品的增长并未能引起固定投资的显著上升。生产的上升只是使用了部分的剩余生产能力。但经济的真正回升却非要靠固定投资的更新不可。目前英国一些主要部门固定投资不仅没有著着增加，而且在去年的前三个季度与前年的同期比较还有了缩减。
    对外贸易在英国经济中有着特别重要的意义。去年生产回升，部分的原因即由于对外贸易的增加。去年前十一个月出口比前年同期增加4．5％，恢复到1957年的对外输出水平。其中对北美的输出比前年同期增加25％；9月和10月增加26％。这一方面是由于美国的经济有了部分的活跃，便利了英国商品的输入。另一方面，在美国钢铁工人大罢工期间，英国看到有机可乘，加紧了它对北美的输出；也是原因之一。英国对西欧输出在去年前八个月也增加了7％，9月和10月增加18％。但英国对英镑区输出在去年前八个月比前年同期却下降7％。9月和10月才增加10％。根本的原因在于：1957—1958年经济危机的发展，原料价格惨跌，英镑区国家的购买力大受挫折，直到1959年底英镑区国家原料出口量增加，入口才有一点起色。但英国经济能够好转，不仅是因为贸易有了增加，还由于贸易条件对英国有利。原来国际原料价格在1957年下跌之后，一直未能恢复，仍处于低水平上；工业品却能维持其垄断价格。去年初，原料价格指数为九十九（1954年为100），4月份下跌到九十六，10月份才恢复到九十九。工业品价格在同期则为一百零九，并且一直保持着这个高水平。工、农业产品价格剪刀差不但使英国可以把危机的后果转嫁到经济落后国家人民的身上，而且英国在去年还继续靠这股横财活跃国内经济，相对地改善了英镑在资本主义世界的地位。英国在去年不仅偿还了国际货币基金组织两亿美元的债，并向这个组织认了一亿六千二百万美元的股，在10月份“提前五年半”清结了在苏伊士侵略战争中欠下的进出口银行的二亿五千多万美元的债。此外还部分地放宽了英镑的自由兑换和美元进口货物的限制。英国经济主要是依靠对英镑区经济落后国家的剥削和不等价交换和凭借某些临时起作用的因素才免强得到回升的。目前已有迹象表明这些因素正在失去它的作用。用人为的刺激和扩大负债的办法刺激消费已渐趋不灵。个人消费支出从去年第三季度开始已见平缓。目前许多重机械工业仍有20％左右的闲置设备能力，因此工业投资增加不会很大。个别工业部门投资可能会有一点增加，主要是消费工业，但它并不能改变整个工业投资的状况。英镑储备由于还债结果，1959年底比1958年底已下降了三亿三千三百万美元。目前总共只有二十七亿三千六百万美元，仅占资本主义世界总储备的6％不到，但英镑却担负着资本主义世界贸易结算的40％。因此英镑的风险仍然是很大。英国经济回升不仅没有解决产生危机的矛盾，相反这些矛盾又在更大的规模上发展起来。
    （一）生产和消费的矛盾更加加深。一方面工业仍有大量的剩余设备能力，另方面由于生活费用上涨，工人实际收入减少，购买力经过一再“刺激”，已呈现疲惫。国内阶级矛盾十分尖锐。特别值得注意的是：这次生产增加是由个人劳动生产率的提高而来，换句话说是由于工人劳动强度的加强和某些工业部门的自动化。前年第三季度每人生产量的指数为一百零四（1954年为一百）去年第三季度则为一百一十一，比一年前增加七点。但生产增加了，失业人数却没有显著减少。去年11月份官方材料失业人数在四十一万以上。去年到9月份为止，英国就业人数比1957年最高点还少十三万。大量失业的存在更进一步地降低了社会购买力。
    （二）国际垄断资本争夺市场矛盾的加剧。美国陷于支付平衡的困境，美元滚滚外流，力图采取一切办法扩大它的出口。由于美国的压力，英国不得不取消许多美元货物的入口限制。欧洲“共同市场”的形成，和英国针锋相对，使英国对西欧出口将会更感困难。西德和日本在争夺国际市场上已占到上风。英国在资本主义世界工业出口中所占份额日趋下降。1950年是25．6％，1955年下降到19．7％。去年第三季度更跌到16．8％。
    （三）国际原料价格下跌，降低了原料国家的购买力，从而部分限制了英国输出的增加。据估计，原料价格下跌使原料国家损失在五亿英镑以上。
    （四）发展生产和保持财政金融稳定性的矛盾。英国有着庞大的海外投资，伦敦城又是英帝国的金融中心，英镑价格的起落触动着英帝国的经济系统。保持英镑的稳定一直是英国经济政策的指导思想。但要发展生产势必扩大入口，入口的增加，又意味着黄金美元储备的外流。过去几次危机都是这样发生的。去年底英国生产有了一点发展，贸易逆差即形扩大。英国政府畏惧金融危机的发生，常常采取一些措施来限制生产。财政金融和生产互为牵制，这也就决定了英国生产不可能有重大发展。
    因此，难怪在目前英国工业生产上升中英国垄断资本的喉舌“金融时报”却在警告1960年英国工业生产的增长速度将低于1959年，并担心英国可能再出现一次国际支付危机。
