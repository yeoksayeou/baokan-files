Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a reply to the Indian government at the end of last year regarding the Sino-Indian border issue. The reply clarifies that the border has never been delineated and that China has consistently respected the status quo. It reaffirms the need for negotiations to resolve the border issue and strengthen Sino-Indian friendship. As long as both sides prioritize the fundamental interests of the two countries and adopt a spirit of mutual understanding and compromise, the border dispute can be resolved. The hope is that the meeting between the two prime ministers will reach a principled agreement, and that the armed forces of both countries on the border will withdraw and first stop patrolling.

The full text of the note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China to the Indian Embassy in China on December 26, 1959, is as follows:

Indian Embassy in the People's Republic of China:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends greetings to the Indian Embassy in the People's Republic of China and hereby states the following regarding the Sino-Indian border issue, requesting that the Embassy convey this to the Indian government:

On September 8, 1959, Premier Zhou Enlai sent a letter to Prime Minister Nehru, providing a comprehensive explanation of the historical background and current situation of the Sino-Indian border issue, as well as the stance and policies of the Chinese government. Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese government received Prime Minister Nehru's letter dated September 26 and the note from the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated November 4. In the letter and note, the Indian government expressed its inability to agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's explanation of the border facts.

The Chinese government has always been willing to maintain friendly relations with the Indian government and people, and has consistently been willing to discuss the border issue in a calm and fair manner with the Indian government to seek a convergence of views. Given the complexity of the Sino-Indian border issue, it is difficult to resolve it through the exchange of letters. The Chinese government has consistently advocated for direct talks between the representatives of the two governments, especially the two prime ministers, to facilitate more effective exchange of views and reach an agreement. However, the talks between the two prime ministers are subject to the agreement of both sides, and the Indian government has complained that the Chinese government has not responded to the relevant parts of the border facts in the aforementioned letter and note. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on instructions, refers to the correspondence between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru on September 8 and 26, as well as the note from the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 4, to further elaborate on several major issues related to the border facts.

China and India are two peace-loving great powers with a long history of friendly relations and many great common tasks in the present and future. The friendship between China and India is not only in the interests of the peoples of the two countries but also in the interests of world peace, especially peace in Asia. Therefore, the Chinese government is very reluctant to engage in disputes with the Indian government over the border issue. Unfortunately, the Sino-Indian border has never been delineated, and Britain has left some legacy of disputes in this regard, while the Indian government has made a series of unacceptable accusations against China, making such disputes unavoidable. Due to the large number of details raised by the Indian government regarding the border issue, although the Chinese government's response seeks to be concise, it still cannot avoid discussing some details to clarify historical facts and mutual views, which is regrettable.

For convenience, the following text will refer to the segment of the border between China's Xinjiang and Tibet and Ladakh as the western segment, the segment from the southeastern end of the western segment to the trijunction of China, India, and Nepal as the middle segment, and the segment east of Bhutan as the eastern segment.

The entire Sino-Indian border has never been delineated, and the several treaties and agreements relied upon by the Indian government cannot serve as legal bases. The need to delineate the Sino-Indian border has long been acknowledged by the Indian and British governments.

The first issue: Whether the Sino-Indian border has been formally delineated

The current disputes over the Sino-Indian border exist because the two countries have never formally delineated the border, and their views on the border differ. According to the Indian maps, the western segment of the border line penetrates deep into Chinese territory, including more than 33,000 square kilometers of land within Indian territory; the middle segment of the border line is relatively close to the Chinese maps but still includes several regions that have historically belonged to China; the entire eastern segment of the border line has been shifted northward, including 90,000 square kilometers of land that originally belonged to China. Therefore, the Chinese government believes that friendly negotiations are needed to reasonably resolve this issue. However, the Indian government believes that the Sino-Indian border currently marked on Indian maps is largely confirmed by international agreements and that there is no need for comprehensive border talks. This makes the talks themselves difficult and risks the border dispute becoming a long-term stalemate. The Chinese government believes that the claim that most of the Sino-Indian border has been formally delineated by international agreements is completely unfounded. The Chinese government hereby provides the following explanation:

1. The 1842 Treaty did not delineate any part of the western segment of the Sino-Indian border.

(1) Regarding the western segment. The Indian government claims that the border line it advocates was delineated by a treaty between the local authorities of China's Tibet and Kashmir in 1842.

However, first, this treaty only mentioned that the border between Ladakh and Tibet would remain unchanged, each side managing its own affairs without infringement, and there was no mention or implication of the specific location of the border. None of the various arguments listed by Prime Minister Nehru in his letter to Premier Zhou Enlai on September 26 this year can prove that the border line currently advocated by the Indian government is valid.

Second, the 1842 treaty was concluded between the local authorities of China's Tibet and Kashmir, and the vast majority of the regions currently in dispute (about 80%) belong to China's Xinjiang, which did not participate in this treaty. If it is believed that this treaty can determine that large tracts of Xinjiang land no longer belong to China but to Ladakh, this is clearly incomprehensible. Regarding the border between Ladakh and Kashmir and Xinjiang, the British government proposed delineation in 1899, but there was no result. If it is believed that a unilateral proposal can appropriate the territory of another country, this is also incomprehensible.

Third, there is much irrefutable evidence that the western segment of the Sino-Indian border has not been delineated. For example: A, from 1921 to 1927, the British Indian government conducted several negotiations with the local authorities of China's Tibet to delineate the border between Ladakh and Tibet, but there was no result. This is evidenced by many documents exchanged by both sides at the time. The British representative, Sir Francis Younghusband, also confirmed this in a letter published in the London Times on December 11 this year. B, according to the materials available to the Chinese government, the official maps published by the Indian Survey Department as late as 1943 did not delineate any border in the western segment of the Sino-Indian border. In 1950, the official Indian maps indicated the current delineated border in a particularly vague manner but still marked it as undelineated. It was only from 1954 that this undelineated border suddenly became a delineated border. C, Prime Minister Nehru announced on August 28 this year in the Indian Lok Sabha regarding this border: "This is along the border of Kashmir State with Tibet and Chinese Turkestan, and no one has delineated this border." All these facts are absolutely incompatible with the claim that this border has long been delineated. No one can imagine that the Indian government, which claims to have clearly delineated this border in 1842 or 1899, would still be repeatedly demanding negotiations to delineate the border from 1921 to 1927, would still acknowledge in 1943 that there is no definite border, would still announce in 1950 that there is only an undelineated border, and would still announce in 1959 that no one has delineated the border.

2. The 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement did not touch upon the border issue between the two countries.

(2) Regarding the middle segment. The Indian government believes that the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement lists six mountain passes in this region as routes for merchants and pilgrims from both sides, indicating that the Chinese government has agreed with the Indian government's views on this segment of the border. The Chinese government believes that this argument is untenable both factually and logically.

The 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement and the negotiations surrounding this agreement did not touch upon the border issue between the two countries. The wording of the fourth clause of the Chinese draft of the agreement was: "The Chinese government agrees to open the following mountain passes in the Ali region of China's Tibet as entry and exit points for merchants and pilgrims from both sides." The Indian side disagreed with the Chinese draft and proposed the wording: "Merchants and pilgrims from India and western Tibet shall travel along the routes passing through the following places and mountain passes." Later, both sides agreed to: "Merchants and pilgrims from both sides shall travel via the following mountain passes and routes." The Chinese government's concession was merely to adopt wording that did not involve the issue of the ownership of these mountain passes. No one can infer from this that the border between the two countries in this segment has been determined. On the contrary, on April 23, 1954, the Chinese representative, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Chang Han-fu, clearly stated in a conversation with the Indian representative, Indian Ambassador Rajeshwar Dayal, that the Chinese side did not wish to involve the border issue in these negotiations. Ambassador Dayal agreed at the time. Therefore, the Chinese government believes that the claim that this segment of the border has been delineated and does not require negotiation is groundless.

3. The Simla Convention itself has no legal effect, and the so-called McMahon Line is completely illegal.

(3) Regarding the eastern segment. The Indian government believes that the so-called McMahon Line was produced at the Simla Conference in 1914, attended by Britain, China, and the local authorities of China's Tibet, and is therefore valid. The Chinese government believes that the so-called McMahon Line is completely illegal, and the Indian government's claim is one that the Chinese government cannot accept under any circumstances.

First, it is well known that the Simla Convention itself has no legal effect. The Chinese representative at the Simla Conference, Chen Yifan, not only refused to sign the Simla Convention but also, on instructions from the Chinese government, formally declared on July 3, 1914, that the Chinese government would not recognize any treaty or similar document signed by Britain and Tibet on that day or any future day. The Chinese Minister to Britain, Liu Yuming, also formally notified the British government twice on July 3 and 7 of the same year, making the same declaration. Subsequent Chinese governments have consistently maintained this position. The many dirty unequal treaties that the Chinese government signed under imperialist pressure have now been declared invalid, and the Chinese government is puzzled as to why the Indian government, which also gained independence from imperialist pressure, would insist that its friendly neighbor, the Chinese government, recognize an unequal treaty that it did not even sign.

Second, the Indian government claims that the Simla Conference discussed the border between India and Tibet, and that the Chinese government did not object to this discussion at the conference, either at the time or later. Therefore, the agreement on the McMahon Line border between India and Tibet produced at the conference must be considered binding on China. However, this claim is completely unfounded. In fact, only the border between China's other parts and Tibet and the so-called inner and outer Tibet was discussed at the Simla Conference, and the border between China and India was never discussed. The so-called McMahon Line border between China and India was produced in a secret exchange of notes between the British representative and the representative of the local authorities of Tibet in Delhi on March 24, 1914, without notifying China, that is, without being placed on the agenda of the Simla Conference. The red line marked in the annex to the Simla Convention is the same as the so-called McMahon Line, but this red line was proposed as the border between Tibet and China's other parts and was never explained that a part of the red line was the dividing line between China and India. Since there was no such thing as the China-India border issue in the Simla Conference and the Simla Convention, the Chinese government would not have mentioned this issue or the so-called McMahon Line issue in its memorandum or in its opinions on the modification of the Simla Convention. The Indian government's claim that the Chinese government did not object to the so-called McMahon Line at the time is merely evidence that the Chinese government was completely unaware of the so-called McMahon Line issue and cannot prove that this line is legal and agreed upon by the Chinese government. It can be seen that the so-called McMahon Line is an even dirtier and more unpresentable thing than the Simla Convention, and the claim that it is binding on the Chinese government is indeed strange. The Chinese government would like to ask the Indian government whether it can point out from the complete records of the Simla Conference on which day of the conference or in which clause of the convention the China-India border issue and the so-called McMahon Line issue were raised?

In addition, it must be pointed out that the right of Britain to negotiate with Tibet alone is beyond doubt. The Chinese government has repeatedly declared that Britain itself, based on the agreement it signed with the former Russian government in 1907 regarding Tibet, is strictly bound not to conduct any negotiations with Tibet without going through the Chinese government. Therefore, based on this treaty obligation alone, it is sufficient to judge that the secret exchange of notes between the British representative and the representative of the local authorities of Tibet in 1914, without the knowledge of the Chinese government, has no legal effect.

Third, the claim that China did not object to the so-called McMahon Line border between China and India is also unfounded. The so-called McMahon Line only gradually and unofficially appeared on Indian maps during the most difficult period of China's War of Resistance against Japan, and after 1943, the local authorities of Tibet were firmly controlled by British imperialism, and their relations with the central government of China became increasingly strained. Nevertheless, the Kuomintang government, after learning of Britain's gradual encroachment on Chinese territory south of the so-called McMahon Line, still protested to the British Embassy in China four times in July, September, November 1946, and January 1947 after the end of the War of Resistance against Japan; due to Britain's shifting of responsibility to India, the Kuomintang government also protested to the Indian Embassy in China in February 1947. Even on November 18, 1949, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which still maintained diplomatic relations with the Indian government, protested to the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its ambassador to India, Luo Jialun, denying the effectiveness of the Simla Convention as recognized by the Indian government. The government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly declared the fact that the Sino-Indian border has not been delineated after establishing diplomatic relations with the Indian government. In 1954, when Prime Minister Nehru visited China, Premier Zhou Enlai clearly pointed out that the Sino-Indian border still needs to be delineated. Premier Zhou also said that the reason why the Chinese maps still use the old delineation is that the Chinese government has not yet surveyed China's borders and has not consulted with the relevant countries and will not unilaterally change the delineation of the borders. This point was restated in the memorandum from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Indian Embassy in China on November 3, 1958. In addition, even the local authorities of Tibet do not consider the so-called McMahon Line, which was manufactured in intrigue and deception, to be reasonable, and they have repeatedly expressed their objections to this line and demanded the return of the Chinese territory occupied south of the line. This fact is not denied even by the Indian government.

Fourth, the so-called McMahon Line border between China and India has not only never been recognized by the Chinese government, but the Indian and British governments have also long been suspicious of its validity. The official map of Tibet and its neighbors published by the Indian Survey Department in 1938 and the map of India in the sixth edition of the Oxford Advanced Atlas published by the British Royal Geographer John Bartholomew in 1940 do not adopt the so-called McMahon Line at all. The map of India in 1945 attached to the book "The Discovery of India" written by Prime Minister Nehru himself, published in 1946 and reprinted in 1951, also does not delineate the eastern segment of the Sino-Indian border according to the so-called McMahon Line. The official complete map of India published by the Indian Survey Department in 1950, 1951, and 1952, although it delineates the so-called McMahon Line, still uses the mark of undelineated border. Until 1958, the map of "Western China and Tibet" in the Times World Atlas drawn by the British Royal Geographer John Bartholomew still marks both the traditional Sino-Indian border and the so-called McMahon Line and notes in words between the two lines "disputed area." All these authoritative facts directly refute the Indian government's argument that this segment of the border has been delineated. The Indian government argues that Britain delayed the publication of the Simla Convention in the hope of reaching an agreement on the status and borders of inner Tibet. This argument, as stated above, not only does not help the Indian government out of its difficulties but also brings new difficulties to the Indian government. Since the British government also acknowledges that no agreement was reached on the Simla Convention, what is the significance of this convention? The convention itself has not come into effect, let alone the so-called China-India border line that the British side unilaterally and secretly forced into this convention, which has never been presented to the Chinese government? In fact, British officials who have served in India, although they are certainly not pro-China, also admit that the McMahon Line is not legally tenable and is ineffective in practice. For example, Henry Twynam, who served as the acting governor of Assam, India, in 1939, testified in a letter to the London Times on September 2 this year that this line "does not exist and has never existed."

In summary, the following definite and unchanging conclusions can be drawn: the entire Sino-Indian border, whether the western, middle, or eastern segment, has never been delineated. The 1842 treaty relied upon by the Indian government did not delineate any part of the western segment of the Sino-Indian border, and the region most related to this border, China's Xinjiang, was not a participant in this treaty. The 1954 agreement relied upon by the Indian government did not involve the middle segment of the Sino-Indian border or other parts of the border. The 1914 treaty relied upon by the Indian government has no legal effect in itself, and the China-India border was never discussed at the 1914 conference. The need to delineate the Sino-Indian border has long been acknowledged by the Indian and British governments, with conclusive evidence. To achieve a mutually satisfactory and reasonable resolution of the Sino-Indian border dispute, there is no other way but to conduct friendly negotiations.

Both sides acknowledge the existence of traditional customary lines, which are the lines formed based on the historical administrative jurisdiction of both sides. The Chinese government's view on traditional customary lines is based on objective facts; the Indian maps delineate the border far beyond the original actual jurisdiction.

The second issue: Where is the traditional customary line of the Sino-Indian border?

Although the Sino-Indian border has not been formally delineated, both sides acknowledge the existence of traditional customary lines, which are the lines formed based on the historical administrative jurisdiction of both sides. The current issue is that both sides have very different understandings of the location of the traditional customary lines. The Indian government, in its maps, delineates the border (mainly the eastern and western segments) far beyond the original actual jurisdiction, claiming that this is not only based on international treaties but also the traditional customary lines. The Chinese government believes that the delineation of the Sino-Indian border in the current Indian maps, as stated above, is not based on international treaties and also lacks the basis of traditional customs.

The vast region of the western segment currently in dispute by India has historically belonged to China, as evidenced by China's official documents and records. Except for a small area of Bariga recently occupied by India, the rest of the vast region has always been under the effective control of the Chinese government. Most of this region is under the jurisdiction of Hetian County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and a small part is under the jurisdiction of the Jitong of Tibet Autonomous Region. Although this region is sparsely populated, it has always been a place for the Uyghur and Kyrgyz residents of the southwestern border of Xinjiang and part of the Tibetan residents of the northwestern border of Tibet to graze and mine salt. Many places here are named in Uyghur. For example, Aksai Chin, which belongs to Hetian County, Xinjiang, means "white stone beach" in Uyghur; and the Karakash River flowing through this region means "jade river" in Uyghur.

This region is the only transportation lifeline connecting Xinjiang and western Tibet because the northeastern part of this region is the Taklamakan Desert of Xinjiang, which has almost no direct transportation with Tibet. Therefore, since the mid-18th century, the Qing government of China has established border posts (border guards) here to exercise jurisdiction and conduct patrols. After the founding of the Republic of China until the liberation of China, troops were frequently stationed in this region. After the liberation of Xinjiang in 1949, the People's Liberation Army of China took over the border defense from the Kuomintang troops. In the second half of 1950, the Chinese government sent the first batch of the People's Liberation Army to Tibet through this region. Over the past nine years, the Chinese troops stationed in the Ali region have been regularly and frequently obtaining indispensable supplies from Xinjiang through this region. From March 1956 to October 1957, the Chinese government built a road from Yecheng, Xinjiang, to Gar, Tibet, along the traditional route, with a total length of 1,200 kilometers, of which 180 kilometers pass through this region, and more than 3,000 workers participated in the construction.

These irrefutable facts should be sufficient to prove that this region is Chinese territory and beyond dispute.

The Indian government claims that this region "has been connected with Indian culture and tradition for more than two thousand years and has become an integral part of Indian life and thought." However, first, the Indian government has not provided any specific facts to support its argument. On the contrary, Prime Minister Nehru said in the Indian Rajya Sabha on September 10 this year that this region "has never been under any jurisdiction." He also said in the Indian Rajya Sabha on November 23 this year: "As far as I know, during the British rule, there was not a single person living in this region, and there was no outpost." Although Prime Minister Nehru cannot correctly judge the situation on the Chinese side, his words do indeed authoritatively prove that India has never exercised jurisdiction over this region.

Second, the Indian government claims that it has regularly sent patrols to this region, and this is a method of exercising jurisdiction. However, according to the materials available to the Chinese government, Indian armed personnel have only entered this region three times in 1958 September, 1959 July, and 1959 October for reconnaissance and were immediately detained and expelled by the Chinese border defense troops, and there have been no other entries into this region. For this reason, the Indian government is completely unaware of the long-term activities of Chinese personnel in this region and claims that Chinese personnel have only entered this region since 1957.

Third, the Indian government cites several maps to support its claim of the traditional customary line. However, this aspect of the situation is also not favorable to India's argument. The delineation of the western segment border in the official maps published by China in the past one or two hundred years, although there are minor differences in some places, is basically consistent. The Indian government claims that there is an official Chinese map published in 1893 whose delineation of the western segment border is close to the Indian map. The Chinese government does not know which map this refers to and cannot comment. As for the map published by the British-run "North-China Herald" in 1917, it can only represent the British view and not the Chinese view, and there is no need to discuss it here.

On the contrary, the delineation in British and Indian maps over more than a century has been quite contradictory and chaotic. The reason is that after Britain occupied Kashmir, it actively attempted to use it as a base to invade China's southern border region and northwestern Tibet, and therefore repeatedly secretly changed the traditional customary line of the western segment border and sent survey teams to invade China. Prime Minister Nehru said that it was only after the survey in 1865 that it was possible to draw an "accurate" map, that is, a map consistent with the current Indian map. However, even so, some famous surveyors still did not want to arbitrarily distort the facts. For example, the delineation of "A Sketch Map of Eastern Turkestan" by Howard in 1870 and "A Sketch Map of the Countries on the North of India" by Shaw in 1871, both mentioned by Prime Minister Nehru in his letter of September 26, are close to the traditional customary line on the Chinese map. Howard clearly stated in his article published in the fourth volume of the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of the United Kingdom in 1870 that the border runs along the main ridge of the Karakoram Mountains to the Kangchenjunga Pass, that is, the correct delineation of this segment of the border is the Chinese map, not the current Indian map. Particularly significant is that the official map drawn by the Indian Survey Department, as late as the 1943 edition, did not delineate any "accurate" border line for this segment of the border, and did not delineate any border line at all. Its 1950 edition, although it colored the region in dispute by India the same as Kashmir, did not mark any border line and still noted "border not specified." This fact has been pointed out before.

Fourth, the Indian government claims that the traditional customary line it advocates also has obvious geographical features, that is, based on the watershed. However, first, the principle of the watershed is not the only or main principle of border delineation internationally, and it is especially not allowed to use the watershed as an excuse to find the border line in another country's territory. Second, the traditional customary line advocated by the Indian government not only does not divide the Indus River system and the Hetian River system but actually cuts off the Hetian River system. On the contrary, the traditional customary line delineated by the Chinese map truly reflects the geographical features of this region. That is, the southern and northern slopes of this region are not steep and are easy to pass through, thus naturally forming the only route connecting Xinjiang and western Tibet. However, to the west, the Karakoram Mountains stand between it and Ladakh, making it extremely difficult to pass through. The Indian government also admits that it is extremely difficult to enter this region from Ladakh.

It can be seen that, whether from the historical actual administrative jurisdiction or from the maps and geographical features proposed by India, the traditional customary line of the western segment border advocated by India is unfounded, and the traditional customary line advocated by China is truly founded.

The various disputed regions in the middle segment are all traditional Chinese territories.

(2) Regarding the middle segment. The various disputed regions involved due to different understandings of the traditional customary lines, namely Jiawa, Qurja, Shipki Pass, Sang, Kongka, Poling Tso, Wuje, Xiangzha, and Labu, are all traditional Chinese territories. Except for Sang and Kongka, which were earlier occupied by Britain, they were only occupied or entered by India after the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement.

The local authorities of Tibet still preserve the feudal documents or land contracts related to these places for several centuries. For example, a decree issued in the name of the seventh Dalai Lama in the 18th century clearly states that Wuje is within the territory of Daba in Tibet. In addition, the local authorities of Tibet have long collected various taxes in these places, and some of the household registers and tax ledgers are still carefully preserved to this day.

The residents who have long lived in these places are almost all Tibetan Chinese. Although their places of residence have been occupied by others, they still do not want to leave their motherland. For example, after Sang and Kongka were occupied by Britain, the local residents still regarded themselves as Chinese citizens and had repeatedly declared to the local authorities of Tibet that they would remain loyal to the local government of Tibet.

It is particularly worth noting that Poling Tso, one of the ten trade markets agreed to be opened in the Ali region of Tibet by the Chinese government in the second clause of the second paragraph of the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement, was occupied by India soon after the agreement was signed.

The Indian government claims that it has long exercised jurisdiction over the above-mentioned places. However, from the notes attached to Prime Minister Nehru's letter of September 26 this year, except for some very forced arguments regarding Sang and Kongka, there are no specific facts regarding the historical exercise of jurisdiction over the other seven places.

The principle of the watershed proposed by the Indian government, due to its inconsistency with the actual jurisdiction of both sides, is also inapplicable here.

The situation of the maps of both sides also shows that the traditional customary lines are observed by China, not India. The delineation of this segment of the border in the maps published by China in the past, although it delineates some very small pieces of Chinese territory outside the Chinese border line, basically reflects the correct traditional customary line. The official Indian maps, as late as 1950, did not delineate the border line of this segment but only noted "border not specified."

The region north of the border line marked on the Chinese map in the eastern segment has been under Chinese jurisdiction until recently.

(3) Regarding the eastern segment. The region between the so-called McMahon Line and the southern foothills of the Himalayas marked on the Chinese map has historically belonged to China and has been under Chinese jurisdiction until recently. This can be proven by a large number of facts.

The local government of Tibet, China, began to exercise jurisdiction over this region, composed of three parts: Menyong, Luoyu, and Xia Zayul, as early as the mid-17th century. Taking the Menyong region as an example, after the fifth Dalai Lama unified Tibet in the mid-17th century, he sent his disciple Meira Lama and the local chief of Dranang, Denben Langka, to establish rule in the Menyong region. By the early 18th century, the local government of Tibet had unified the entire Menyong region and gradually divided it into thirty-two "dzongs" (some individually called "den"). In Menyong, the capital Dawang, an administrative management committee called "Dawang Zizhi" and a higher-level temporary administrative conference called "Dawang Zhuzhi" were established to lead the affairs of the entire region. The local government of Tibet has always appointed officials to the various administrative levels of Menyong, collected taxes from all parts of the region (mainly grain tax, twice a year), and exercised judicial power. The local government of Tibet has always included Menyong in its censuses and has never made an exception. The local nationality, the Monba, is deeply influenced by the Tibetans in religious, economic, and cultural life. They believe in Lamaism, use Tibetan script and currency. The sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, was born in the Menyong region, and his family has received decrees from the successive local governments of Tibet.

The Chinese government has repeatedly declared the fact that the Sino-Indian border has not been delineated after establishing diplomatic relations with the Indian government. In 1954, when Prime Minister Nehru visited China, Premier Zhou Enlai clearly pointed out that the Sino-Indian border still needs to be delineated. Premier Zhou also said that the reason why the Chinese maps still use the old delineation is that the Chinese government has not yet surveyed China's borders and has not consulted with the relevant countries and will not unilaterally change the delineation of the borders. This point was restated in the memorandum from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Indian Embassy in China on November 3, 1958. In addition, even the local authorities of Tibet do not consider the so-called McMahon Line, which was manufactured in intrigue and deception, to be reasonable, and they have repeatedly expressed their objections to this line and demanded the return of the Chinese territory occupied south of the line. This fact is not denied even by the Indian government.

Title: The Boundary Question Between China and India

It should also be pointed out that even after the so-called McMahon Line was drawn and published, the local Tibetan government continued to exercise jurisdiction over this region extensively and for a long period. For example, as late as 1951, the administrative facilities of Tibet in the Congdu area were still relatively intact. In Lhoyu and Lower Zayul, until 1946, the administrative institutions of "dzong" and "dron" were still relatively extensive, and they continued to pay taxes and provide labor services to the Lhasa authorities.

Therefore, the Indian government's claim that "the Tibetan authorities have never exercised jurisdiction in this region" and that the local "tribes have not been influenced in any way by Tibetan culture, politics, or other aspects" is not credible.

The Indian government claims that it has always exercised jurisdiction over this region. However, according to the statements of Prime Minister Nehru himself, India's administrative management was "gradually moved in," and until around 1914, it was "generally more or less letting these tribes take care of themselves," with only "British political officials coming to this region." And what did the British officials who came to this region say? In the letter dated September 26 of this year, Prime Minister Nehru mentioned Captain Bailey, who was sent by the British Indian government in 1913 to conduct illegal surveys in southeastern Tibet to draft the so-called McMahon Line. In his 1957 book "Journey to Tibet Without a Passport," he described the situation of Tibetan local government's jurisdiction over the Congdu area at that time. In the letter published in the London Times on September 7 of this year, he said, "When we arrived at Tawang (which is the capital of Congdu), we found that it was purely under the jurisdiction of Tibetans." Even thirty years after the so-called McMahon Line was drawn, in 1944, the Assam authorities of India sent Fuller-Haimendorf, who was then the special envoy of the Indian Foreign Ministry to Subansiri, to conduct a survey in this region. In his 1955 book "The Himalayan Tribes," he also confirmed that the boundaries of this area had not been determined or surveyed, and the Indian authorities had not managed this area. This shows how groundless it is to say that this region has belonged to India for decades or centuries, and that the current boundaries have always been historical boundaries.

The Indian government says that the British signed some agreements with several local tribes between 1844 and 1888, and these agreements are evidence of India's jurisdiction. However, the 1853 agreement with the Monpas cited by Prime Minister Nehru begins with the statement by the Monpas: "We...on behalf of the Regent King, send a letter of friendship to the Deputy Governor of the Northeast Frontier, wishing to restore the original friendly relations between the Indian government and our Lhasa government..." This text irrefutably proves that they belonged to Tibet, not India, and that the Indian government signed the agreement with them on the premise of acknowledging their belonging to Tibet. The Regent King mentioned here is the Tibetan local government's regent. As for the agreements with the Abors and Akas cited, it is clear from the text that these tribes' regions were not within British territory—some agreements even explicitly state that British territory "extends to the foot of the mountain (referring to the southern slope of the Himalayas)." And these ethnic groups were not British subjects.

From the historical materials provided by both China and India, it can be seen that this region has always belonged to China, not to Britain or India.

This judgment can be further strongly supported by the authoritative maps published by the two countries. China's published maps usually draw this region within Chinese territory, i.e., according to the true traditional boundary along the southern slope of the Himalayas. According to the materials currently available from the Chinese government, the official maps published by the Indian Survey Department until the 1938 edition still adopted the same method. After 1938, until 1952, the Indian Survey Department changed the drawing method to mark the boundary according to the so-called McMahon Line, but still used the undetermined boundary symbol. Then, starting from 1954, it changed again to mark the undetermined boundary as a determined boundary. Such changes made the attitude from originally acknowledging that this region was Chinese territory to claiming that this region had always been Indian territory. However, the current drawing method of Indian maps is still not accepted internationally. As mentioned earlier, the map collection published by the British Royal Geographer John Bartholomew in 1958 still considers this to be a disputed region, and the map of "India in 1945" attached to Prime Minister Nehru's own book "The Discovery of India" is still consistent with the drawing method of Chinese maps.

In the face of these authoritative facts, the British church organization, the China Inland Mission's 1906 map of the Qing Empire published in London, is obviously insignificant.

Based on the above, it can be seen that the Chinese government's view on the traditional customary line is based on objective facts and is proven by a large amount of factual materials. While the boundary line marked on the Indian map, except for the middle section which is mostly consistent with reality, does not represent the traditional customary line. The boundary lines of the eastern and western sections, especially the eastern section, can undoubtedly be seen as the product of Britain's modern history of aggressive expansion.

Regarding Britain's aggressive expansion policy in modern history, it is unnecessary to discuss because whether it is the history of India itself, or the history of the neighboring countries of India that were once part of or vassals of British India, or the history of China, especially the history of China's Tibet region adjacent to India, can all serve as evidence. While Britain was carrying out military aggression against Tibet and plotting to separate Tibet from China, it also conducted encroachment on the map and in reality on the Tibetan border, resulting in the boundary line that was later inherited by India and marked on the current Indian map. Of course, the great peace-loving people of India are not responsible for any of the aggressive activities carried out by Britain using India as a base. However, the Indian government insists on claiming that the boundary line illegally created by British aggression against Tibet, even including areas that British power had not yet reached, as the traditional customary boundary line, and regards the Chinese government's pointing out the true traditional customary boundary line as proposing a large territory demand to India, which is astonishing. If the Indian government were in the position of the Chinese government, what would it think? Insisting on such a statement will inevitably lead to the conclusion that British imperialists are the most just, and the oppressed China is full of ambition; the powerful British Empire has been defending the traditional Sino-Indian border for over a century, while the weak China has been invading British territory! The Chinese government believes that such a conclusion will not be accepted by anyone.

The Chinese government has always advocated: through friendly consultations, comprehensively solve the border issues between the two countries; before that, both sides should maintain the status quo of the border; for some disputes, they can reach partial and temporary agreements through negotiations.

The third issue: What is the correct way to resolve the Sino-Indian border dispute?

Starting from the fact that the borders between China and India have never been formally demarcated and there are differences in the understanding of the borders between the two sides, the Chinese government has always advocated: the two sides should consider the historical background and the current situation, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, through friendly consultations, comprehensively solve the border issues between the two countries; before that, as a temporary measure, both sides should maintain the status quo of the border, and not take unilateral actions, let alone use force, to change this situation; for some disputes, they can reach partial and temporary agreements through negotiations.

The Indian government does not agree with the Chinese government's view that the border is undetermined and needs to be resolved through negotiations, and only acknowledges that some minor local adjustments can be made. However, the Indian government agrees that both sides should maintain the status quo of the border, avoid the use of force, and resolve disputes through consultations. Thus, although there are differences, the peace of the border and the friendship between the two countries should have been guaranteed. What surprised the Chinese government was that the Indian government repeatedly claimed that the Chinese government had previously agreed that the border was determined and accepted the Indian government's position on the border, but only changed its stance recently. At the same time, the Indian government also gave an incorrect interpretation of the status quo of the border and repeatedly violated the status quo in its actual actions, even using force, thus creating a tense situation on the border. In this case, the Indian government blamed the Chinese government for everything, saying that China had "aggressive" and "expansionist" ambitions. The above attitude of the Indian government made the border issue more difficult and complicated.

For this reason, the Chinese government believes it is necessary to clarify the following issues:

The Chinese government's consistent attitude is that the border is undetermined and needs to be resolved through negotiations between the two countries. The Indian government's accusation that the Chinese government has changed its stance is not based on facts.

(1) Whether the Chinese government has ever agreed that the border is determined and accepted the Indian government's position on the border, and then changed its stance.

The Indian government mentioned the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement, believing that this agreement had dealt with all outstanding issues between India and the Tibetan local government, and therefore the border issue should be considered resolved.

The fact is that the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement is about the trade and transportation agreement between China's Tibet and India, and it did not involve the border issue at all. There is no regulation regarding the border in the text. It can be recalled that at that time, the most urgent problem that both countries were concerned about and needed to solve was the problem of establishing normal relations between India and China's Tibet on a new basis. In the negotiations, neither side requested to discuss the border issue, which was to avoid affecting the solution to the most urgent problem at that time. Both sides were aware of this. At the beginning of the negotiations, Premier Zhou Enlai explained to the Indian government delegation that the task of this negotiation was "to solve the matured pending issues between the two countries." Later, both sides also agreed in the fourth meeting on January 8, 1954, that the task of this negotiation was to solve the matured pending issues between the two countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In April 23 of the same year, the Chinese representative also pointed out that this negotiation would not involve the border issue. The Indian representative expressed agreement with this opinion of the Chinese side. Therefore, there is no fact to show that the Chinese government agreed with the Indian government's view on the border or that the Chinese government was not prepared to raise the border issue for discussion later.

The Indian government also mentioned the meeting between the two premiers in Beijing in October 1954, believing that Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks on the Chinese map meant that the Chinese government would modify its map according to the Indian map, that is, the Chinese government accepted the Indian government's position on the border.

The fact is that at that time, Prime Minister Nehru had objections to the drawing method of the Chinese map regarding the Sino-Indian border. Therefore, Premier Zhou Enlai explained that the drawing method of the Chinese map on the border was inherited from the old maps, and the Chinese government could not modify the drawing method of the border without surveying and consulting with the relevant countries. At that time, Premier Zhou Enlai also specifically mentioned that China had undetermined borders with India and several other southwestern neighboring countries. However, Prime Minister Nehru said that he believed there was no border issue between China and India. From this conversation, it can be seen that there were obvious differences in the views of the two sides on the border, and Premier Zhou Enlai clearly expressed his disagreement with unilateral modifications to the map.

The Indian government also mentioned the meeting between the two premiers at the end of 1956 in India, believing that at that time Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks on the so-called McMahon Line meant that the Chinese government acknowledged this line.

The fact is that when Premier Zhou Enlai mentioned the so-called McMahon Line, he said that this boundary line was illegal and had never been acknowledged by the Chinese government. He also explained that, nevertheless, to ensure the peace of the border and to consider the friendship between the two countries, Chinese military and political personnel would strictly not cross this line, and expressed the hope to find a suitable way to solve the eastern border issue in the future. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement, in any case, cannot be interpreted as the Chinese government's acknowledgment of this line.

From this, it can be seen that the Chinese government's consistent attitude is that the border is undetermined and needs to be resolved through negotiations between the two countries. The Indian government's suggestion that the Chinese government has changed its original stance is not based on facts.

The Chinese government has always respected the status quo of the border. Indian armed personnel have repeatedly expanded their occupied areas.

(2) Whether the Chinese government has seriously respected the status quo of the border.

Before the Sino-Indian border issue is comprehensively resolved, it is necessary to maintain the status quo of the border, which is a principle agreed upon by both sides.

The Chinese government adheres to this principle. In the past decade since liberation, Chinese military and political personnel have been ordered not to exceed the range where China has historically exercised jurisdiction, and in the eastern section, they have not even crossed the so-called McMahon Line.

The Indian government's interpretation of the status quo of the border is not based on the actual jurisdiction range of both sides, but on the unilateral boundary line drawn on the Indian map, which includes a large area of land that India has never reached. In this way, Indian armed personnel have repeatedly violated the status quo of the border, gradually expanding their occupied areas, and occupying Bariga, Gyaw, Churah, Shibuji Pass, Boringdingdu, Xangzha, Labudi, and others, and also invading Aksai Chin, Pangong Lake, Kongka Pass, and Wuje. However, the Indian government considers these actions as maintaining the status quo. In the eastern section, after the rebellion in Tibet in March of this year, Indian armed personnel even crossed the so-called McMahon Line and temporarily occupied Langju and Tamadon north of the line, and are still occupying Jiamacani.

Despite the fact that the Indian side has occupied the Chinese market of Boringdingdu as stipulated in the 1954 Agreement and temporarily occupied Tamadon, which the Indian government itself acknowledges as Chinese territory, the Indian government has never considered itself to have violated the status quo of the border. Instead, based on the boundary line drawn on its own map, it accused China of violating the status quo of the border. This is unacceptable to the Chinese government.

The Chinese government has always rejected the use of force. The responsibility for the two armed clashes should not be on China.

(3) Whether the Chinese government has seriously avoided the use of force.

Recently, two armed clashes that neither side wanted to happen occurred in the Majhun area and the Kongka Pass area, which is very unfortunate. However, the responsibility for this does not lie with China. The incident on August 25 in the Majhun area was caused by the Indian armed personnel who occupied Langju advancing further to the south side of Majhun and attacking the Chinese patrol personnel. The Chinese armed personnel had never attacked the Indian outpost illegally established in Langju, but it was the Indian armed personnel of the Langju outpost who launched a larger-scale attack the next day, while the Chinese troops stationed in Majhun did not respond. The claim that the Chinese army drove the Indian armed personnel out of the Langju outpost with superior forces is not true. The Chinese armed personnel only entered this place six days after the Indian armed personnel withdrew from Langju on September 1.

The situation of the Kongka Pass incident on October 21 is even clearer. On the day after three Indian armed personnel were detained for intruding into Chinese territory, more than sixty Indian armed personnel, carrying light and heavy machine guns and other weapons, continued to intrude and launched an armed attack on the Chinese patrol team, which had only fourteen people and were only equipped with light weapons. The Chinese patrol personnel repeatedly issued warnings not to shoot before and after the Indian side opened fire. The deputy squad leader Wu Qingguo waved his hand and shouted at the Indian personnel not to shoot, but it was this respectable comrade who was the first to be shot. After that, the Chinese patrol personnel were forced to return fire.

The Chinese government's consistent rejection of the use of force can also be proven by the following facts:

A. After the first confrontation between the two sides in Wuje on Chinese territory in 1955, the Chinese government immediately proposed that both sides should not station troops in Wuje and wait for a negotiated solution.

B. For the Chinese territories occupied by the Indian side, such as Bariga, Gyaw, Churah, Shibuji Pass, Sang, Xangzha, Boringdingdu, and Jiamacani, the Chinese government has never attempted to force the Indian armed personnel to withdraw by force. Even for places that the Indian government itself acknowledges as Chinese territory, such as Tamadon, the Chinese government has patiently waited for the Indian troops to withdraw voluntarily without resorting to force.

C. For Indian armed personnel who have entered the defense area of Chinese border outposts, the Chinese border defense troops always first persuade them to leave, and only when they refuse to listen to the persuasion, they disarm them and hand them over to the border along with their weapons.

D. All Chinese border personnel have been strictly ordered not to use force unless they have already been subjected to armed attacks.

E. After the unfortunate incident at the Kongka Pass, the Chinese government immediately ordered the troops guarding the Sino-Indian border to stop patrolling along the entire line.

F. In order to thoroughly and effectively prevent any border conflict, the Chinese government has recently repeatedly proposed that both sides' armed personnel should withdraw twenty kilometers or other appropriate distances from the border.

The above facts prove that the Chinese government has taken all possible measures to maintain the peace of the border, prevent the use of force, and avoid armed clashes.

After the Kongka Pass incident, the Indian government also issued instructions to stop patrolling, and expressed to the Chinese government that in any case, force should not be resorted to unless it is absolutely necessary for self-defense. This is undoubtedly welcome. However, before the two clashes, the Indian government issued a note to the Chinese government on August 11 of this year, stating that the Indian border personnel had received orders: "to resist intruders and may use the necessary minimum force for this purpose if their warnings are not heeded." The Indian government's note also said, "If any Chinese troops are still in Indian territory now, they should withdraw immediately, otherwise it may lead to conflicts that could have been avoided." Even after the first clash, according to the Indian government's note to China on August 27 of this year, the Indian border personnel still had the order "to use force against intruders when necessary." It must be pointed out that since the two countries have different understandings of the border and different maps, and the Indian government regards a large area of Chinese territory that has historically been under Chinese jurisdiction as Indian territory, then the Chinese military and political personnel stationed on their own territory will inevitably be called "intruders" by the Indian side. In this way, the Indian subordinates can more or less freely use force according to their own understanding. Obviously, the occurrence of the two unfortunate border incidents cannot be said to be unrelated to such orders.

Socialist China has no, does not have, and should not have any intention to threaten others. It not only cannot, should not, and does not need to invade neighboring countries, but also hopes that they will prosper and become strong.

(4) Whether China wants to "invade" and "expand."

Recently, in India, there has been a lot of anti-China rhetoric surrounding the Sino-Indian border issue, using cold war language to abuse China as "imperialism," "expanding towards India," and "conducting aggression." Such malicious attacks on China, regardless of facts, cannot but make the Chinese people feel deeply regretful.

The Chinese government has noted that in India, there is a relatively popular saying that China is now becoming strong and wants to expand like certain Chinese rulers in history or modern imperialists. Those who spread this saying, apart from those who obviously harbor hostility towards China, may include a large number of people who lack a true understanding of New China. In this case, the Chinese government believes that it is beneficial to explain China's position to the Indian government and the Indian people again.

Although the Chinese people have begun to achieve some success, China's economy and culture are still very backward, and the Chinese people still need to make decades, even hundreds of years of hard work, to overcome this backwardness. However, China will never become a threat to its neighboring countries in the future, just as China does not believe that India will become a threat to China when it becomes strong as China hopes. The saying that China's population growth and industrial development will pose a threat to neighboring countries is absolutely incomprehensible to the Chinese people. The social system of China is a socialist system where the working people hold political and economic power. The people and government of socialist China have no, do not have, and should not have any intention to threaten others. Moreover, it must be noted that the following facts: First, since liberation, although China's population has grown relatively rapidly, the average annual growth rate is only 2%, while the average annual growth rate of grain production is 9.8%, and the highest year reached 35%. In the future, China's grain yield per unit area and agricultural labor productivity will be greatly improved. Moreover, China's land is vast, and more than half of the area is sparsely populated and needs to be developed. Therefore, the Chinese people absolutely do not need to invade other countries' land to feed themselves. Second, although China's industry has grown, it is still far from meeting the needs of its domestic people. China is rich in resources and has a large domestic market. Its industry does not need to seize raw materials from abroad, nor does it need to dump finished products abroad. Third, due to the development of industry and agriculture, China's labor force is not surplus but insufficient. Therefore, China does not have surplus population to export abroad.

The Chinese people, in order to achieve the great goal of peaceful construction, urgently need a long-term international peaceful environment. Therefore, in foreign relations, the Chinese government has always adhered to the policy of peace, and is willing to live in friendship with all countries, big or small, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. For the various issues that exist between China and other countries, the Chinese government has always advocated seeking a fair and reasonable solution through peaceful means, rather than resorting to force. China not only cannot, should not, and does not need to invade neighboring countries, but also hopes that they will all quickly prosper and become strong. Because only in this way can we better prevent imperialist wars and aggression, maintain peace in this region; and better communicate and support each other's construction.

Regarding the border issue, China does not want an inch of other countries' land. China has undetermined borders with many neighboring countries, but China has never, and will never, use this situation to take unilateral actions to make any changes to the actual situation of the border. Whether the border is demarcated or not, China is willing to work with its neighboring countries to create the most peaceful, safest, and friendliest border area, so that neither side will have doubts or conflicts over the border issue.

Regarding Bhutan and Sikkim, it can also be mentioned. China, in addition to hoping to live in friendship with them and not invade, has no other intentions. The Sino-Bhutan border, according to the drawing method of both sides' maps, only has some differences in the segment south of the so-called McMahon Line, but the borders of both sides have always been quiet. The Sino-Sikkim border has been formally demarcated, and there is no disagreement in the drawing method of the map, nor is there any dispute in reality. All the so-called China's "occupation" of Bhutan and Sikkim are as absurd as saying that China wants to invade India and other southwestern neighboring countries.

The basic position of the Chinese government towards neighboring countries has been repeatedly stated and does not need to be repeated. Unfortunately, the Indian side has recently, especially after the suppression of the rebellion by the reactionary serf owners in Tibet, made various distortions and attacks on China. The Chinese government, for the friendship between the two countries, does not want to respond to attacks with attacks, but is willing to assume that the Indian government has some misunderstanding of China's intentions. Perhaps due to some reasons, the attack movement against China may continue. Even if the situation is unfortunate, the Chinese government believes that the misunderstanding of those who have no malice towards China will not last long. Because, if China is indeed invading and threatening India or other countries, denying it a thousand times will not change the facts; if the facts are not so, then even if there are a thousand propaganda machines spreading China's "invasion" and "threat" around the world, they can only make the propagandists themselves lose credibility. "A long journey reveals the strength of a horse, and a long time reveals the heart of a person." China's peaceful and friendly attitude towards India can stand the test of time. The Chinese government believes that the truth can be temporarily covered up in the short term, but it is impossible to cover it up in the long term.

As long as both sides take the fundamental interests of friendship between the two countries as the priority, adopt a tolerant and accommodating attitude, the border dispute is not difficult to resolve. The Chinese government hopes that the meeting between the two premiers can first reach some principled agreements on the border issue, and as a preliminary step, stop patrolling along the entire border before the border is demarcated.

(5) What is the key to resolving the Sino-Indian border issue?

The governments of China and India have important differences in their positions on the border issue, and there is still a tense situation on the border between the two countries. However, the Chinese government has never doubted that the tense situation will pass, and the border issue will be resolved through friendly consultations.

The Chinese government's belief is based on: the two countries have a history of thousands of years of friendship, with no irreconcilable conflicts, and both sides urgently need to concentrate on the long-term peaceful construction at home, and are willing to strive for world peace. It is unreasonable and unimaginable to continue arguing endlessly. On the border issue, both sides have expressed a willingness to maintain the status quo of the border and to resolve border disputes through peaceful means. This shows that China and India can live in friendship, and the border issue can be reasonably resolved. Moreover, from the opposite side, there is no other choice. Both sides cannot change the geographical reality of being neighbors, nor can they cut off exchanges along the long border line, and it is absurd to imagine that the two great friendly neighboring countries with a total population of more than one billion will wage war over such temporary and local disputes. Therefore, resolving border disputes through peaceful means and in a friendly manner is the only logical conclusion.

What is the key issue that needs to be resolved urgently? The Chinese government respectfully proposes the following opinions to the Indian government:

A. The Chinese government believes that regardless of the views of both sides on certain specific facts of the border, there should be no more disagreement on a most basic fact known to the world, which is that the entire border between the two countries has indeed never been demarcated, and therefore, it still needs to be resolved through negotiations. Accepting this simple fact should not cause any difficulty for both sides, because it does not harm the real interests of any side, nor does it constrain both sides in proposing their own views in border negotiations. Once an agreement is reached on this point, it can be said that the way to resolve the border issue has been opened. For the specific disputes on various sections of the border, although both sides have been insisting on their own views so far, as long as both sides take the fundamental interests of friendship between the two countries as the priority and adopt a non-prejudiced and accommodating attitude, these disputes are not difficult to resolve. If the Indian view proves to be more reasonable and more beneficial to the friendship between the two countries, China should accept it; if the Chinese view proves to be more reasonable and more beneficial to the friendship between the two countries, India should accept it. The Chinese government hopes that the upcoming meeting between the two premiers can first reach some principled agreements on the border issue, providing guidance and foundation for the future discussions and drafting of solutions by both sides.

B. Before the border is formally demarcated, it is necessary to effectively maintain the status quo of the border between the two countries and ensure the peace of the border. For this purpose, the Chinese government proposes: both sides' armed forces on the border should withdraw twenty kilometers or other distances deemed appropriate by both sides; and as a preliminary step for this fundamental measure, both sides' armed personnel should stop patrolling along the entire border.

The Chinese government believes that if an agreement can be reached on the above two points, the situation on the Sino-Indian border will immediately improve, and the clouds hanging over the relations between the two countries will quickly dissipate.

The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the views expressed here on the past, present, and future of the Sino-Indian border issue can be understood in the most benevolent way by the Indian government, and help to achieve a satisfactory solution to this issue and an improvement in the relations between the two countries. Although it is necessary to engage in some arguments to respond to unjust accusations, the intention and purpose of the Chinese government are not to argue, but to end the arguments.

China and India are two great countries, both with a great past and future. In recent years, based on the great ideal of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the two countries have worked closely together to maintain world peace. Today, history calls on the people of the two countries again to make greater contributions to peace and human progress in the world while completing their own great transformations. The task that falls on the shoulders of this generation of China and India is arduous but glorious. The Chinese government hereby reaffirms its sincere wish: the two countries will stop arguing, quickly resolve the border issue reasonably, and on this basis, consolidate and develop the great friendship between the two peoples in their common cause.

With the highest respect,

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China

专栏：

    中华人民共和国外交部去年底就中印边界问题复照印度政府
    阐明边界从未划定中国一贯尊重现状
    重申谈判解决边界问题巩固中印友谊
    只要双方以两国友好根本利益为重，采取互谅互让态度，边界争执不难解决  希望两国总理会晤取得原则协议，双方边境武装部队后撤并首先停止巡逻
    新华社2日讯　中华人民共和国外交部1959年12月26日给印度驻华大使馆的照会，全文如下：印度共和国驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部向印度共和国驻华大使馆致意，并谨就中印边界问题陈述如下，请大使馆转达印度政府：
    周恩来总理在1959年9月8日曾经致函尼赫鲁总理，就中印边界问题的历史背景和当前的实际情况，以及中国政府的立场和方针，作了全面的申述。在此以后，周恩来总理和中国政府收到尼赫鲁总理9月26日的来信和印度外交部11月4日的来照。在来信和来照中，印度政府表示不能同意周恩来总理对边界事实的申述。
    中国政府对印度政府和人民始终愿意保持友好，对于边界问题，也始终愿意以心平气和、对人公平、对己公平的态度，同印度政府进行讨论，以求双方观点的接近。鉴于中印边界问题具有一定的复杂性，很难依靠信件的交换获得解决，中国政府一贯主张，两国政府的代表，首先是两国的总理，迅速举行面对面的会谈，以便更有效地交换意见和达成协议。但是，两国总理的会谈还有待双方协商决定，而印度政府又抱怨中国政府没有对上述来信和来照中有关边界事实的部分作出答复。因此，中国外交部奉命，参照周恩来总理9月8日和尼赫鲁总理9月26日的来往信件以及印度外交部11月4日来照，就有关边界事实的几个主要问题，作出进一步的申述。
    中国和印度是两个爱好和平的大国，有互相友好的悠久历史，在目前和今后也有许多伟大的共同任务。中印两国的友好，不但是两国人民的利益，而且是世界和平特别是亚洲和平的利益。因此，中国政府很不愿意就边界问题同印度政府进行争论。不幸，中印边界一直没有划定，英国在这方面又留下了一些纠纷的遗产，而印度政府又对中国进行了一系列令人不能接受的指责，竟使这种争论无法避免。由于印度政府提出了大量的有关边界问题的细节，中国政府在自己的答复中虽然力求简要，但是为了澄清历史真相和彼此的观点，仍然不能不涉及若干细节，这是很抱歉的。
    为了方便，在以下的行文中，将把中国的新疆和西藏同拉达克接壤的一段边界简称为西段，把从西段的东南端到中国、印度、尼泊尔三国交界处为止的一段边界简称中段，把不丹以东的一段边界简称东段。
    整个中印边界都没有划定过，印度政府所依据的几项条约和协定都不能成为合法根据。中印边界之有待划定是印度政府和英国政府所长期承认的
    第一个问题：中印边界是否正式地划定过
    中印边界目前存在着一些争论，原因就是两国从没有正式划定过边界，两国关于边界的看法互有出入。按照印度地图的画法，西段边界线深入中国领土，把三万三千多平方公里的土地画入印度境内；中段边界线，同中国地图的画法比较接近，但是也把若干历来属于中国的地区画入印度境内；东段边界线全线被向北推移，把原属中国的九万平方公里的土地画入印度境内。因此，中国政府认为，需要举行友好的谈判加以合理的解决。但是印度政府认为，目前印度地图上所标明的中印边界，大部分是为国际协定肯定了的，没有理由举行全面的边界谈判。这样就使谈判本身遭到了困难，使边界争端有长期陷于僵局的危险。中国政府认为，中印边界大部分已由国际协定正式划定的说法，是完全不符合事实的。中国政府谨作以下的说明：
    1842年条约并没有划出中印西段的任何边界
    （1）关于西段。印度政府认为自己所主张的边界线，曾经由1842年中国西藏地方当局和克什米尔当局之间订立的一个条约划定过。
    但是，第一，这个条约仅仅提到拉达克和西藏的疆界将维持原状，各自管理，互不侵犯，根本没有关于边界具体位置的任何规定或暗示。尼赫鲁总理在今年9月26日给周恩来总理的信件中列举的关于边界的位置早已划定的种种论据，没有一个能证明印度政府目前主张的边界线是有根据的。
    第二，1842年条约是在中国西藏地方当局和克什米尔当局之间订立的，而目前印度政府提出争论的地区，绝大部分（约占80％）属于并未参加这一条约的中国的新疆。如果认为，根据这个条约就可以判明，新疆的大片土地已经不属于中国而属于拉达克，那显然是不可理解的。关于拉达克和克什米尔同新疆的边界，1899年英国政府曾经建议划定，但是并无任何结果。如果认为，一次片面的建议就可以把别国的领土据为己有，那也是不可理解的。
    第三，中印西段边界的没有划定，还有许多不可辩驳的积极的证据。例如：甲、从1921年直到1927年间，英属印度政府曾经向中国西藏地方当局进行过多次交涉，要求划定拉达克和西藏之间的边界，但是始终没有结果。这有当时双方交换的许多文件可资证明。曾任印方代表的英国罗西安爵士，也在今年12月11日伦敦泰晤士报刊登的投书中证明了这一点。乙、根据中国政府现有的材料，印度测量局迟至1943年出版的官方地图，关于中印西段还没有画出任何边界。在1950年，印度官方地图用特别模糊的方式表示出现在所画的边界，但是仍然用文字标明是未定界。只是从1954年起，这段未定界才忽然变成了已定界。丙、尼赫鲁总理今年8月28日在印度人民院谈到这段边界时宣布：“这是沿克什米尔邦同西藏和中国土耳其斯坦的疆界，没有谁划定过这条疆界。”所有这一切事实，都是同这段边界早已划定的说法绝对不相容的。任何人都不能想像，自认为在1842年或1899年就已经明确划定了这段边界的印度政府，还会在1921年到1927年间不断地要求谈判划界，还会在1943年承认没有任何确定的边界，还会在1950年宣布只有未定界，还会在1959年宣布没有谁划定过边界。
    1954年的中印协定根本没有接触到两国边界问题
    （2）关于中段。印度政府认为，1954年中印协定第四条列举了这个地区内的六个山口作为双方商人和香客的通道，这就表明了中国政府已经同意印度政府关于这一段边界的意见。中国政府认为，这种说法在事实上和逻辑上都是不能成立的。
    1954年的中印协定和关于这一协定的谈判，根本没有接触到两国边界问题。协定第四条中国方面草案的措词是：“中国政府同意在中国西藏地方阿里地区开放下列山口，作为双方商人和香客的出入口”。印度方面不同意中国的草案，他们提出的草案的措词是：“来自印度和西藏西部的商人和香客得沿着途经下列地点和山口的道路旅行”。后来双方协议改为：“双方商人和香客经由下列山口和道路来往”。中国政府的让步，只是采纳了不涉及这些山口的归属问题的措词。任何人也无法由此推断说，这就确定了两国在这一段的边界。相反，在1954年4月23日，中国代表、中国外交部章汉夫副部长在同印度代表、印度大使赖嘉文先生谈话中，还明白表示，在这次谈判中，中国方面不希望涉及边界问题。赖嘉文大使当时表示同意。因此，中国政府认为，关于这段边界已经划定、不需要进行谈判划定的说法，是没有根据的。
    西姆拉条约本身就没有法律效力，所谓麦克马洪线是完全非法的
    （3）关于东段。印度政府认为，所谓麦克马洪线是1914年英国、中国和中国西藏地方共同参加的西姆拉会议上产生的，因此是有效的。中国政府认为，所谓麦克马洪线是完全非法的，印度政府的说法是中国政府所断然不能接受的。
    首先，举世周知，西姆拉条约本身就没有法律效力。参加西姆拉会议的中国代表陈贻范，不但拒绝在西姆拉条约上签字，并且根据中国政府的训令在1914年7月3日正式向会议声明，凡英国和西藏本日或他日所签订的条约或类似的文件，中国政府一概不能承认。中国政府驻英公使刘玉麟，又在同年7月3日和7日两次正式照会英国政府，作了同样的声明。此后历届中国政府都坚持这个立场。中国政府在帝国主义的压迫下曾经签过字的许多肮脏的不平等条约，现在已经宣告失效了，中国政府感到困惑的是，同样从帝国主义压迫下得到独立的印度政府，为什么会硬要自己的友邦中国政府承认一个它连字都没有签过的不平等条约。
    其次，印度政府断言，西姆拉会议上讨论了印度和西藏之间的边界，而中国政府不论在当时或以后都没有反对在会上讨论印度和西藏之间的边界，因而会议所产生的关于印度和西藏之间的麦克马洪线边界的协定，必须被认为对中国具有拘束力。但是这种说法从头到尾都不符合事实。事实上，在西姆拉会议上只讨论过中国其他部分和西藏地方以及所谓内外藏的界线，从来没有讨论过中国和印度的边界。所谓中印边界的麦克马洪线，是英国代表和当时西藏地方当局的代表在1914年3月24日在德里用秘密换文的方式产生的，根本没有通知过中国，也就是说，根本没有上过西姆拉会议的日程。西姆拉条约附图中所标明的红线有一段的画法同所谓麦克马洪线相同，但是这条红线是作为西藏同中国其他部分之间的界线提出来的，而从来没有被说明过，红线的某一部分是中国和印度的分界线。在西姆拉会议和西姆拉条约中既然根本不存在所谓中印边界问题，中国政府当然不会在自己的备忘录或者对于西姆拉条约的修改意见书中提到这一问题，或者提到所谓麦克马洪线问题。印度政府说当时中国政府没有对所谓麦克马洪线提出异议，这个事实只是表明了中国政府根本不知道有所谓麦克马洪线问题，而决不能证明这条线是合法的，为中国政府所同意了的。由此可见，所谓麦克马洪线是一个比西姆拉条约更肮脏、更不能见人的东西，说它对于中国政府具有约束力，确实是格外离奇的。中国政府愿意询问印度政府，它究竟能否从西姆拉会议的全部纪录中指出，在会议的哪一天，或者在条约的哪一条，曾经提出中印边界的问题和特别提出所谓麦克马洪线的问题？
    此外，还必须指出，对于英国没有同西藏单独谈判的权利这一点，是不容怀疑的。中国政府固然曾经就这一点作了一再的声明，就是英国政府，根据它自己同旧俄政府在1907年所订的关于西藏的协定，也受有严格的约束，非通过中国政府不得同西藏进行任何谈判。因此，只是根据英国政府自己所负的这一项条约义务，也足以判断，1914年英国代表和西藏地方当局代表瞒着中国政府的秘密换文，没有任何法律效力。
    第三，说中国对于所谓中印边界的麦克马洪线没有提出异议，也是不符合事实的。所谓麦克马洪线是在中国抗日战争的最困难时期才陆续地和非正式地出现在印度地图上的，而从1943年以后，西藏地方当局又受到英帝国主义的牢牢控制，同中国中央政府关系日见恶劣。虽然如此，国民党政府在获悉英国对所谓麦克马洪线以南的中国领土逐步侵入以后，仍然在抗日战争结束以后的1946年7月、9月、11月和1947年1月，四次照会英国驻华大使馆提出抗议；由于英国把责任推给印度，国民党政府又在1947年2月照会印度驻华大使馆提出抗议。甚至在1949年11月18日，当时还同印度政府保有外交关系的蒋介石集团的驻印大使罗家伦，还照会印度外交部，否认印度政府所认为有效的西姆拉条约。中华人民共和国政府在同印度政府建立外交关系以后，也一再声明中印边界未经划定的事实。在1954年尼赫鲁总理访华的时候，周恩来总理就曾经明确地指出中印边界尚待划定。周总理并且说，中国地图之所以沿用旧地图的画法，是因为中国政府还没有对中国的边界进行勘察，也没有同有关各国商量，不会自行修改疆界的画法。关于这一点，在1958年11月3日中国外交部给印度驻华大使馆的备忘录曾经复述过。此外，就是西藏地方当局，也不认为在阴谋诡计中制造出来的所谓麦克马洪线是合理的，它一再表示了对这条线的异议，要求归还线南被占的中国领土。这个事实，就是印度政府也不否认。
    第四，所谓中印边界的麦克马洪线，不但中国政府从未承认过，而且印度政府和英国政府对于它的有效性也是长期怀疑的。印度测量局1938年出版的“西藏和邻国”的官方地图和英国皇家制图员约翰·巴索罗缪所绘制的1940年牛津高级地图集第六版所载“印度”一图，都根本没有采取所谓麦克马洪线。1946年出版、1951年三版的尼赫鲁总理本人所著的“印度的发现”（英文本）一书中所附“1945年的印度”一图，也同样没有按照所谓麦克马洪线描绘中印东段边界线。印度测量局在1950、1951、1952年出版的官方的印度全图，虽然画出了所谓麦克马洪线，但是仍然用了未定界的标记。直到1958年，英国皇家制图员约翰·巴索罗缪所绘制的泰晤士世界地图集中的“中国西部和西藏”一图，仍然把中印传统边界和所谓麦克马洪线都标出来了，并且在两线之间用文字注明
  “争议地区”。所有这一切具有权威的事实，都直接驳倒了印度政府关于这一段边界已经划定的论点。印度政府争辩说，英国所以迟迟没有公布西姆拉条约，为的是希望就内藏的地位和界线达成协议。这个说法之不能帮助印度政府脱出困难，已如上述，而且还给印度政府带来新的困难。既然英国政府也承认没有就西姆拉条约达成协议，那么这个条约还有什么意义呢？条约本身都没有生效，何况英国方面片面地、偷偷地往这个条约里硬塞的一条从没有向中国政府提出过的所谓中印边界线呢？事实上，曾经在印度任职的英国负责官员，虽然决不是亲华的，也承认麦克马洪线在法律上站不住脚，在实际上是没有效力的。例如，曾在1939年担任印度阿萨姆代理省督的亨利·特威南，就在今年9月2日的伦敦泰晤士报上投书作证，这条线“并不存在，而且从来没有存在过”。
    综上所述，可以得出如下的确定不移的结论：整个中印边界，无论西段、中段和东段，都是没有划定过的。印度政府所依据的1842年条约，并没有划出中印西段的任何边界，而且同这个边界关系最大的中国新疆地方，并不是这个条约的参与者。印度政府所依据的1954年协定，并没有涉及中印中段边界或者其他部分的边界。印度政府所依据的1914年的条约，本身就没有法律效力，而且在1914年的会议上也从没有讨论过中印边界。中印边界之有待划定，是印度政府和英国政府在长期间所承认的，具有确凿无疑的证据。为了使中印边界的争端获得双方满意的合理解决，除了进行友好的谈判以外，没有任何别的出路。
    双方都承认有传统习惯线，这就是根据双方历来管辖所及而形成的界线。中国政府关于传统习惯线的看法，是以客观事实为基础；印度的地图把边界画得大大超出原来实际管辖的范围
    第二个问题：中印边界的传统习惯线在哪里
    中印边界虽然未经正式划定，但是双方都承认有传统习惯线，这就是根据双方历来管辖所及而形成的界线。现在的问题是，双方对于传统习惯线的位置有很不相同的认识。印度政府在自己的地图上，把边界（主要是东段和西段）画得大大超出了原来实际管辖的范围，断言这不仅有国际条约为根据，而且也就是传统习惯线。中国政府认为，印度现行地图关于中印边界与中国地图大不相同的那些画法，不仅如前所述，没有国际条约为根据，而且也没有传统习惯的根据。
    印度提出争论的西段广大地区历来属于中国
    （1）关于西段。现在印度提出争论的面积达三万三千多平方公里的地区，历来属于中国，这在中国的官方文书和记载中有确凿的证据。其中除了一块很小的巴里加斯地区最近几年被印度侵占而外，其余的广大地区始终是在中国政府的有效控制之下。这个地区大部分属中国新疆维吾尔自治区的和阗县管辖，小部分属中国西藏自治区的日土宗管辖。这个地区虽然人烟稀少，却历来是新疆西南边境的维吾尔族和柯尔克孜族居民以及一部分西藏西北边境的藏族居民放牧和采盐的场所。这里的许多地方都是以维吾尔语命名的。例如，属于新疆和阗县的阿克赛钦，就是维吾尔语“白石滩”的意思；而流贯这个地区的喀拉喀什河，就是维吾尔语“墨玉河”的意思。
    这个地区是联结新疆和西藏西部的唯一交通命脉，因为在这个地区的东北就是新疆的大戈壁，那里同西藏简直不能有什么直接的交通。因此，从十八世纪中叶起，中国的清朝政府就设立卡伦（边卡），对这里行使管辖，进行巡逻。在中华民国成立以后一直到中国解放为止的几十年中，也经常有部队在这一地区设防。1949年新疆解放后，中国人民解放军从国民党军队手中接管了这个地区的边防。1950年下半年，中国政府通过这个地区派出了首批进入西藏的中国人民解放军部队。九年来，驻在阿里地区的中国部队一直正常地、频繁地通过这个地区由新疆方面取得不可缺少的补给。从1956年3月到1957年10月，中国政府沿着习惯通道，修筑了一条从新疆叶城到西藏噶大克的公路，全长达一千二百公里，其中有一百八十公里通过这一地区，参加筑路的民工达三千余人。
    这些不可动摇的事实，本来应该足以证明这一地区是中国的领土而不容置辩。
    印度政府说，这个地区“同印度两千多年来的文化和传统有联系，而且已经成为印度生活和思想的密切的一部分”。但是，第一，印度政府并没有举出任何具体事实来支持它的论断。相反，尼赫鲁总理今年9月10日在印度联邦院说，这个地区“一直没有受到过任何的管辖”。他在今年11月23日，又在印度联邦院说：“据我所知，在英国统治时期，这个地区没有一个人居住，也没有任何前哨据点。”尼赫鲁总理虽然无法正确判断中国方面的情况，但是他的话的确权威地证明了印度从来没有管辖过这个地区。
    第二，印度政府说它在这一地区一直定期地派有巡逻队，并且说这就是印度行使管辖的一种方法。但是根据中国政府所掌握的材料，印度武装人员只在1958年9月、1959年7月和1959年10月三次侵入这一地区进行过侦察，随即被中国边防部队扣押并且递解出境，此外再没有到过这个地区。正因为这样，印度政府才会对于中国人员在这一地区的长期活动毫无所知，以至宣称中国人员只是从1957年起才进入这个地区。
    第三，印度政府举出了若干地图来证实它所主张的传统习惯线。但是，这一方面的情况对于印度的论点也并不有利。中国在近一、二百年间出版的地图对于西段边界的画法尽管在一些地方有微小的出入，但是基本上始终一致。印度政府提出，有一种在1893年出版的中国官方地图，对西段边界的画法接近于印度地图。中国政府不知道这里指的是什么地图，无法加以评论。至于英国人所办的“字林西报”1917年出版的地图集，那只能代表英国而不能代表中国的观点，在这里没有讨论的必要。
    与此相反，一个多世纪以来英国和印度的地图上的画法，前后却有很大的矛盾和混乱。原因是，英国在侵占克什米尔以后，曾经积极企图以此作为基地向中国的南疆地区和西藏西北部进行侵略，因此不断私自窜改西段边界的传统习惯线，并且为此而派出测量队侵入中国。尼赫鲁总理说，在1865年经过测量以后，才有可能画出“准确的”也就是同印度现行地图符合的地图。但是即使如此，一些著名的测量者仍然不愿任意歪曲事实。例如，1870年海华德的“东土耳其斯坦略图”和1871年肖的“印度北边的国家略图”的画法——这两个测量者都是尼赫鲁总理在9月26日信中提到的——就都接近于中国地图上的传统习惯线。海华德在他发表在1870年英国皇家地理学会杂志第四十卷的论文中，明确地说明边界是沿着喀喇昆仑山的主脉到羌臣摩各山口的，这也就是说，关于这段边界的画法，正确的是中国地图而不是印度的现行地图。特别有意义的是，印度测量局所绘制的官方地图，迟至1943年的版本中，对于这一段边境不但没有画出任何“准确的”边界线，而且根本没有画出任何边界线。它的1950年的版本，虽然把印度提出争论地区涂上了同克什米尔一样的颜色，仍然没有标出任何边界线，而且还注明“边界未经规定”。这个事实，在前面已经指出过了。
    第四，印度政府说，它所主张的传统习惯线还具有明显的地理特点，即依据分水岭。但是，首先，分水岭的原则在国际上并不是划界的唯一的或主要的原则，尤其不允许借口分水岭到别国境内去寻找边界线。其次，印度政府所主张的传统习惯线，不但没有划分印度河水系和和阗河水系，而恰恰是切断了和阗河的水系。相反，中国地图所画的传统习惯线才真正反映了这个地区的地理特点。那就是，这个地区南北坡度不大，容易通行，因此自然形成连接新疆和西藏西部的唯一通道。但是往西行，它同拉达克之间却矗立着高入云霄的喀喇昆仑山脉，极难通行。印度政府也承认，从拉达克进入这个地区是极其困难的。
    由此可见，不论是从历来实际行政管辖情况来看，或是从印度提出的地图和地理特点来看，印度所主张的西段边界的传统习惯线都是没有根据的，而中国所主张的传统习惯线才是真正有根据的。
    中段的各块争议地区都是中国的传统领土
    （2）关于中段。由于双方对传统习惯线认识不一而牵涉到的各块争议地区，即巨哇、曲惹、什布奇山口、桑、葱莎、波林三多、乌热、香扎、拉不底，都是中国的传统领土。它们除桑、葱莎较早地为英国侵占外，都只是在1954年中印协定以后才被印度侵占或侵入的。
    西藏地方当局迄今为止还保存着数世纪以来的有关这些地方的封地文书或土地契约。例如，十八世纪以七世达赖喇嘛名义颁发的一项诏书，就明文载明乌热是在西藏达巴宗的地界之内。此外，西藏地方当局历来在这些地方征收各种赋税，有些地方的户口清册和税收簿册，还一直妥善地保存到现在。
    长期生活在这些地方的居民几乎全部是中国藏族。尽管他们居住的地方已经被人侵占，他们还是不愿意脱离自己的祖国。例如，在桑、葱莎被英国侵占后，当地居民仍然认为他们是中国的百姓，并且曾经一再向西藏地方当局声明，保证忠于中国西藏地方政府。
    必须特别指出的是，上述地点中的波林三多，是1954年中印协定第二条第二款所规定的由中国政府同意在西藏阿里地区开放的十个贸易市场之一。它和其他九个市场，都是应印度政府代表、印度大使赖嘉文先生在谈判的第一次会议上就提出的要求而开放的。但是，波林三多却在1954年协定签订后不久被印度所侵占。
    印度政府说，它对上述地点一直进行着管辖。但是，从尼赫鲁总理今年9月26日信后所附的注释中，除了对于桑、葱莎两地提出了一些十分勉强的论据外，对于其他七个地方都没有任何关于历来行使管辖的具体事实。
    印度政府提出的分水岭原则，由于不符合双方实际管辖情况，在这里也是不能适用的。
    双方地图的情况，也说明遵守传统习惯线的，是中国而不是印度。中国过去出版的地图对这段边界的画法，尽管把个别很小块的中国领土画在中国边界线以外，但是基本上反映了正确的传统习惯线。而印度的官方地图，迟至1950年也没有画出这一段的边界线，只是注明“边界未经规定”。
    东段中国地图标明的边界线以北的地区直到不久以前还由中国行使管辖
    （3）关于东段。从所谓麦克马洪线到喜马拉雅山南麓中国地图所标明的边界线之间的地区，历来属于中国，并且直到不久以前还由中国行使管辖。这可以从大量的事实中得到证明。
    中国的西藏地方政府，早从十七世纪中叶起，就对由门隅、洛渝、下察隅三部分组成的这个地区，开始行使管辖权。以门隅地区为例，十七世纪中叶，五世达赖喇嘛统一西藏以后，就派他的弟子梅惹喇嘛和错那土酋定本朗喀主扎，共同到门隅地区建立统治。到十八世纪初，西藏地方政府就统一了整个门隅，并且将全区陆续划分为三十二个“错”（个别称“定”）。在门隅的首府达旺，建立了叫做“达旺细哲”的行政管理委员会，和叫做“达旺住哲”的高一级的非常设行政会议，领导全区事务。西藏地方政府一向对门隅的各级行政机构委派官吏，向全区各地征收赋税（主要是粮食税，一年两次），并行使司法权力。西藏历次清查户口也把门隅计算在内，而不例外。当地的民族，门巴族，在宗教、经济、文化生活等方面，也受藏族很深的影响。他们信奉喇嘛教，通用藏文和藏币。六世达赖喇嘛仓央嘉错就出生于门隅地区，他的家属历代受有历届西藏地方政权所颁封的诏书。
    还须指出，甚至在所谓麦克马洪线划出和发表以后，西藏地方政府也仍在这个地区内广泛地和长时期地继续行使管辖权。例如，直到1951年，西藏在门隅的行政设施还相当完整地保存着。在洛渝和下察隅，直到1946年以前，还相当广泛地保存着“错”和“定”的行政机构，并且继续向拉萨当局缴纳赋税，供应差役。
    因此，印度政府说，“西藏当局在任何时候都没有在这个地区行使管辖权”，当地“部落丝毫没有受到西藏文化、政治或其他方面的影响”，等等，这些说法是不能置信的。
    印度政府说它历来在这个地区行使管辖。但是按照尼赫鲁总理自己的说法，印度的行政管理是“逐渐移入”的，直到1914年左右还“一般是或多或少地让这些部落自己照顾自己”，只是“英国政治官员们来过这个地区”。而来过这个地区的英国官员们又怎样说呢？尼赫鲁总理今年9月26日信中提到的那位贝利上尉——他是英属印度政府为拟定所谓麦克马洪线而专门在1913年派往西藏东南部地区进行非法勘测的——在他1957年出版的“没有护照的西藏之行”一书中，就曾经叙述了当时西藏地方政府对于门隅地区的管辖情况；在今年9月7日伦敦泰晤士报刊登的他的一封信中，他又说：“我们到达达旺（按即门隅首府）的时候，发现那里纯粹是西藏人掌握着管辖权。”甚至在所谓麦克马洪线划出以后三十年，即1944年，印度阿萨姆当局派往这个地区进行考察的富勒—海门多夫——他当时任印度外交部驻苏班西里的特派员——在他1955年出版的“喜马拉雅的夷区”一书中，也证实这个地带的边界未经确定，也未经勘察，印度当局也没有对这个地带进行管理。由此可见，说这个地区几十年来、几百年来就属于印度，说现有的边界一直是历史上的边界，等等，是何等地不能立足。
    印度政府说，英国人在1844至1888年之间曾同当地几个部落签订过一些协定，而这些协定就是印度行使管辖的证据。但是，尼赫鲁总理所援引的1853年同门巴族人的协定，一开头就是门巴人的声明：“我们……受第巴王的委托向东北边境总督代理人致以友谊之函，愿恢复印度政府和我们拉萨政府之间原有的友好关系……”这段文字恰好不可动摇地证明了他们是属于西藏而不是属于印度，而且印度政府正是在承认他们属于西藏的前提下同他们订立协定的。这里所提到的第巴王就是西藏地方政府摄政王。至于被援引的同阿波尔人和同阿卡人的协定，从条文中也可以清楚地看出，这些部落的地区不在英国的领土之列——有一部分协定还明确地说明英国的领土“延伸到山脚（指喜马拉雅山南麓）为止”——。而这些民族也不是英国的臣民。
    从以上中印双方提供的历史资料可以看出，这个地区历来属于中国，而不属于英国或印度。
    这一判断还可以从两国出版的有权威性的地图中得到进一步的有力的证明。中国出版的地图通常都把这个地区划在中国领土之内，即按照位于喜马拉雅山南麓的真正传统边界标明边界线。根据中国政府现有的材料，印度测量局出版的官方地图直到1938年的版本也还采取同样的标法。在1938年以后，直至1952年，印度测量局改变画法，变成按所谓麦克马洪线标明边界，但是还用未定界符号。然后，从1954年起，又变成把未定界改标为已定界了。这样地变来变去，就把自己的态度从原来承认这个地区是中国的领土，变成说这个地区从来就是印度的合法领土了。但是印度现行地图的画法在国际上仍然没有得到接受。在前面已经提到，1958年出版的英国皇家制图员约翰·巴索罗缪绘制的地图集，仍然认为这是一个有争议的地区，而尼赫鲁总理本人所著的“印度的发现”一书中所附的“1945年的印度”的插图，也仍然同中国地图的画法一致。
    在这些权威性的事实面前，印度政府所援引的英国教会组织、中国内地会1906年在伦敦出版的大清帝国舆图，显然是微不足道了。
    基于以上所述，可以看出，中国政府关于传统习惯线的看法，无论在西段、中段或东段，都是以客观事实为基础，并且为大量事实资料所证明了的。而印度地图所标出的边界线，除了中段大部分符合实际以外，其他根本不代表传统习惯线。东西两段的边界线，特别可以不容置疑地看出，是英国近代史上侵略扩张政策的产物。
    关于英国在近代史上的侵略扩张政策，本来是不需要讨论的，因为无论印度本身的历史，或者曾经沦为英属印度的一部分或属国的印度邻国的历史，或者中国的历史，特别是与印度相接的中国西藏地方的历史，都可以作为证明。英国在实行武力侵略西藏和阴谋使西藏脱离中国的同时，又对西藏边界进行地图上的和实际上的蚕食，其结果就是造成了这条以后为印度所继承下来并且标明在印度目前地图上的边界线。当然，伟大的爱好和平的印度人民，对于英国以印度为基地所进行的一切侵略活动，是不负任何责任的。但是，印度政府硬把英国侵略西藏所非法制造出来的、甚至把英国的权力还没有及到的地区都包括进去的界线，说成是边界的传统习惯线，而把中国政府实事求是地指出边界的真正传统习惯线，倒说成是对印度提出了大片领土要求，这是令人惊异的。如果印度政府处在中国政府的地位，对此将会有什么样的想法呢？坚持这样的说法，将必然引伸出这样的结论，即英国殖民主义者是最为公正的，被压迫的中国是野心毕露的；强大的英帝国主义百余年来，一直在捍卫传统的中印边界，孱弱的中国却不断在侵犯英国的领土！中国政府认为，这种结论是不会被任何人接受的。
    中国政府一贯主张：通过友好协商全面解决两国边界问题；在此以前双方应该维持边界的现状；对于一部分争执可以通过谈判达成局部性和临时性的协议
    第三个问题：什么是解决中印边界争端的正确途径
    从以上所述中印两国边界从来未经正式划定、双方对边界的认识存在着分歧的事实出发，中国政府一贯主张：中印双方应该考虑历史的背景和当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，通过友好协商，全面解决两国边界问题；在此以前，作为临时性的措施，双方应该维持边界的现状，而不以片面行动，更不允许使用武力，来改变这种状况；对于一部分争执，还可以通过谈判，达成局部性和临时性的协议。
    印度政府不同意中国政府关于边界未定和需要经过谈判全面解决的说法，只承认可以作一些次要的局部调整。但是，印度政府同意双方应该维持边界的现状，避免使用武力和通过协商解决争执。这样，双方虽有分歧，边境的安宁和两国的友谊本来是可以保证的。使中国政府感觉意外的是，印度政府一再宣称中国政府早先是同意边界已定和接受了印度政府对边界的主张的，只是到了最近才改变了立场。与此同时，印度政府还对于边界的现状作出了不正确的解释，在自己的实际行动中一再破坏了现状，甚至使用了武力，从而造成了边境的紧张局势。在这种情况下，印度政府反而指责中国政府应对这一切负责，说中国有“侵略”和“扩张”的野心。印度政府的以上态度，就使得边界问题变得更加困难和复杂起来。
    为此，中国政府认为有必要澄清以下几个问题：
    中国政府认为边界未定、有待两国谈判解决的态度是一贯的。印度政府指责中国政府改变立场是不符合事实的
   （1）中国政府是否曾经同意边界已定和接受印度政府对边界的主张，而后来改变了立场。
    印度政府提到1954年的中印协定，认为这个协定已经处理了印度同西藏地方之间的全部未决问题，因此边界问题应被认为已经解决。
    事实是，1954年的中印协定是关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定，根本没有涉及边界问题，在条文中找不出任何有关边界
  的规定。可以忆及，当时两国所最关切和亟需解决的问题，是印度同中国西藏地方在新的基础上建立正常关系的问题。在谈判中，任何一方都没有要求讨论边界问题，这是为了避免影响对当时最迫切问题的解决。对于这一点，双方都是清楚的。在谈判一开始的时候，周恩来总理就向印度政府代表团说明，这次谈判的任务是“解决两国间业已成熟的悬而未决的问题”。以后，双方又在1954年1月8日的第四次会议上共同确定，这次谈判的任务是根据和平共处五项原则来解决两国间业已成熟的悬而未决的问题。在同年4月23日，中国代表又指出，这次谈判将不涉及边界问题。对于中国方面的这个意见，印度代表表示了赞同。因此，没有任何事实说明中国政府同意了印度政府对边界的看法，或者中国政府不准备在以后提出边界问题来讨论。
    印度政府还提到两国总理1954年10月在北京的会谈，认为周恩来总理关于中国地图的谈话，意味着中国政府将按印度地图修改自己的地图，也就是说，中国政府接受了印度政府对边界的主张。
    事实是，当时尼赫鲁总理对中国地图关于中印边界画法有异议。因此，周恩来总理说明，中国地图对边界的画法是沿用了老的地图的，中国政府在没有进行勘察、也没有同有关各国商量以前，不好自行修改边界的画法。当时周恩来总理还特别说明了中国同印度以及其他几个西南邻国都有未定的边界。但是，尼赫鲁总理说，他认为中印之间并不存在边界问题。从这段谈话可以看出，双方对边界的看法有明显的分歧，周恩来总理也明确地表示不同意对地图作单方面的修改。
    印度政府还提到两国总理1956年底在印度的会谈，认为当时周恩来总理关于所谓麦克马洪线的谈话，意味着中国政府承认这条线。
    事实是，周恩来总理在提到所谓麦克马洪线的时候说，这条界线是非法的，是从来没有为中国政府所承认的。他同时说明，尽管如此，为了保证边境的安宁和照顾到两国的友好，中国军政人员将严格不越过此线，并且表示希望以后能找出解决东段边界的适当办法。周恩来总理的这段申述，无论如何不能被解释为中国政府对于这条线的承认。
    由此可见，中国政府认为边界未定、有待两国谈判解决的态度是一贯的。印度政府暗示中国政府改变了原有的立场的说法，是不符合事实的。
    中国政府一贯尊重边界的现状。印度武装人员一再扩大自己的占领范围
    （2）中国政府是否认真尊重边界的现状。
    在中印边界问题全面解决以前，应该维持边界的现状，这是双方一致同意的原则。
    中国政府信守这个原则。解放十年来，中国的军政人员一律奉令不超越中国历来行使管辖的范围，在东段甚至不越过所谓麦克马洪线。
    印度政府对边界现状的解释，却不是以双方实际管辖范围为准，而是以印度地图上所画的、把印度管辖从未及到的大片土地都划进去了的片面边界线为准。这样，印度武装人员就一再破坏边界的现状，陆续扩大自己的占领范围，侵占了巴里加斯、巨哇、曲惹、什布奇山口、波林三多、香扎、拉不底等地，并且侵入阿克赛钦、班公湖、空喀山口和乌热。但是，印度政府把这些行动都算是维持现状。在东段，在今年3月西藏发生叛乱以后，印度武装人员甚至超越了所谓麦克马洪线，一度侵占了该线以北的朗久、塔马顿，现在仍然侵占着兼则马尼。
    尽管印度方面侵占了1954年协定规定的中国市场波林三多，并且一度侵占了印度自己也承认是中国领土的塔马顿，印度政府却始终不认为自己破坏了边界现状，反而根据自己地图所画的边界线，指责中国破坏了边界现状。这是中国政府所不能同意的。
    中国政府一贯拒绝使用武力。应该对两次武装冲突事件负责的并不是中国
    （3）中国政府是否认真避免使用武力。
    最近，在马及墩地区和空喀山口地区两次发生了双方都不希望发生的武装冲突事件，这是极为不幸的。但是，应该对此负责的并不是中国。8月25日在马及墩地区的事件，是由于侵占朗久的印度武装人员继续向前推进到马及墩的南侧，袭击中国的巡逻人员而引起的。中国的武装人员从未袭击印度在朗久非法设立的哨所，倒是朗久哨所的印度武装人员次日发出了更大规模的射击，而驻防马及墩的中国军队一直没有置理。所谓中国军队以优势兵力把印度武装人员逐出朗久哨所的说法是不真实的。中国的武装人员只是在印度武装人员8月27日撤离了朗久的第六天，即9月1日，才进入了这个地方。
    10月21日空喀山口事件的情况更为明显。在三名印度武装人员侵入中国领土被扣的次日，印度武装人员六十余人，携带轻重机枪等武器继续入侵，向为数只有十四人和只配带轻武器的中国巡逻队发动武装进攻。中国的巡逻人员在印方开火前和开火后一再发出不要射击的警告。中国的副班长吴庆国向印度人员挥手并且呼喊，要他们不要射击，但是正是这位可敬的同志首先中弹牺牲了。在这以后，中国巡逻人员才被迫还击。
    中国一贯拒绝使用武力，还可以从下列事实得到证明：
    甲、当1955年在中国的领土乌热第一次出现双方武装对峙的局面以后，中国政府就主动提出双方都不在乌热驻军、以待谈判解决的建议。
    乙、对于被印方侵占的中国领土，巴里加斯、巨哇、曲惹、什布奇山口、桑、葱莎、波林三多、香扎、拉不底、兼则马尼等地，中国政府从没有试图以武力逼迫印度武装人员退出。甚至对于连印度政府自己也承认是中国领土的地方，像塔马顿，中国政府也是耐心等待印军自行撤出，而没有诉诸武力。
    丙、对于侵入中国边防哨所防区以内的印度武装人员，中国边防部队总是先劝告他们离境，只是在他们拒绝听从劝告的情况下，才解除他们的武装，然后连同他们的武器一并递解出境。
    丁、中国的一切边防人员受有严格的命令，除非已经遭到武装攻击，绝对不得动用武力。
    戊、中国政府在空喀山口的不幸事件发生以后，立即下令防守中印边界的部队在全线停止巡逻。
    己、为了彻底、有效地防止任何边境冲突事件，中国政府最近一再提出了在边境上双方武装人员各自后撤二十公里或者其他适当距离的建议。
    以上事实证明，中国政府曾经采取了一切可能的措施以保持边境的安谧，防止使用武力和发生武装冲突。
    印度政府在空喀山口事件以后，也发出指示要边防人员停止巡逻，并且向中国政府表示，双方在任何情况下不应该诉诸武力，除非是万不得已为了自卫。这无疑是值得欢迎的。但是，在两次冲突事件发生以前，印度政府在今年8月11日曾经照会中国政府，印度边防人员已经奉到命令：“将抵抗侵越者，并可为此目的使用必要的最低限度的武力，如果他们发出的警告不受理睬的话”。印度政府的照会还说，“如果任何中国军队现在还留在印度境内，他们应该立即撤出，否则将可能导致本来可以避免的冲突”。甚至在第一次冲突事件发生以后，根据印度政府今年8月27日给中国的照会，印度边防人员仍然奉有指令，“在必要时对侵越者使用武力”。必须指出，既然两国对边界的认识以及两国的地图都不一致，而印度政府把大片历来由中国管辖的中国领土都视为印度领土，那么，驻守在本国领土上的中国军政人员就势必会被印度方面说成是“侵越者”。这样，印度的下级执行者就可以多少自由地根据自己的理解动用武力。显然，两次边境不幸事件的发生，不能说同这样的命令没有关系。
    社会主义中国根本没有、也不可能有、也不应该有威胁别人的意图，不仅不可能、不应该和不需要侵略邻近国家，而且十分希望它们繁荣富强
    （4）中国是否要“侵略”和“扩张”。
    最近，围绕中印边界问题，在印度出现了大量的反华言论，它们使用冷战的语言，谩骂中国是“帝国主义”，“向印度扩张”和“从事侵略”。这种对中国的不顾事实的恶意攻击，不能不使中国人民感到深切的遗憾。
    中国政府注意到，在印度目前有这样一种比较流行的说法，那就是，中国现在强大起来了，它要像历史上的某些中国统治者或者现代帝国主义者那样地向外扩张。传播这种说法的，除了显然对中国怀有敌意的人以外，可能有一大部分人是由于对新中国缺乏真切的了解。在这种情况下，中国政府认为，向印度政府和印度人民再次说明一下中国的立场，是有益的。
    尽管中国人民开始取得一些成就，中国的经济和文化仍然十分落后，中国人民还需要作几十年、甚至上百年的艰苦努力，才能克服这种落后现象。但是中国在今后无论什么时候，都不会变成自己邻国的威胁，正如中国不相信印度在像中国所热望的那样强大起来以后，会变成中国的威胁一样。认为中国人口的增加和工业的增长将对邻国形成威胁的说法，对于中国人民是绝对不可理解的。中国的社会制度是由劳动人民掌握政治权力和经济权力的社会主义制度，社会主义中国的人民和政府，根本没有、也不可能有、也不应该有威胁别人的意图。而且，还必须注意到下列的事实：第一，解放以来，中国的人口虽然有了较快的增长，但是每年的平均增长率也只有2％，而粮食产量的平均增长率却达到9．8％，最高年份曾达到35％。在今后，中国的粮食单位面积产量以及农业的劳动生产率，还将大大地提高。何况中国土地辽阔，还有一半以上的地区人口稀少，有待大力开发。因此，中国人民绝对不需要侵夺别国的土地来养活自己。第二，中国的工业虽然有了一些增长，但是还远远不能满足国内人民的需要。中国资源丰富，国内市场广大，它的工业既不需要从国外攫取原料，也不需要向国外倾销成品。第三，由于工农业的发展，中国的劳动力不是过剩，而是不足。因此，中国没有过剩的人口需要向国外输出。
    中国人民为了实现和平建设的伟大目标，迫切地需要一个长期的国际和平环境。因此，在对外关系中，中国政府一贯奉行和平政策，对于一切国家，不论大小，都愿意在五项原则的基础上友好相处。对于同别国之间所存在的各项问题，中国政府一贯主张以和平方法谋求公平合理的解决，而不诉诸武力。中国不仅不可能、不应该和不需要侵略邻近的国家，而且十分希望它们都很快地繁荣富强起来。因为只有这样，我们这些国家才能更有效地防止帝国主义的战争和侵略，维持这个地区的和平；才能更好地互通有无，互相支援彼此的建设事业。
    就边界问题来说，中国绝不要别国的一寸土地。中国同许多邻国之间都还有一些未定的边界，但是中国从没有、也永不会利用这种情况，采取单方面的行动，去对边境实际存在的状况作任何改变。无论在边界划定或者没有划定的情况下，中国都准备同自己的邻国，同心协力，创立最和平、最安全和最友好的边境地带，使彼此不为边境问题发生疑惧或冲突。
    对于不丹和锡金，也可以附带说明一下。中国除去希望同它们友好相处、互不侵犯而外，再没有其他的想法。中不边界按照双方地图的画法，只在所谓麦克马洪线以南的一段有一些出入，但是双方的边境一直是安静的。中锡边界早经正式划定，在地图画法上既没有分歧，在实际中也没有纠纷。一切所谓中国要“侵占”不丹和锡金的说法，正如同说中国要侵犯印度和其他的西南邻国一样，都是荒谬无稽之谈。
    中国政府对待邻国的这种基本立场，早已再三申述过，本来不需要多说。不幸印度方面在最近时期，特别是在中国西藏地方反动农奴主的叛乱被平定以后，对于中国的态度作了种种歪曲和攻击。中国政府为了两国的友谊，不愿意用攻击答复攻击，而宁愿假定，印度政府对于中国的意图的确有某种误解。也许由于某种原因，对中国的攻击运动还会继续下去。即使情况不幸是这样，中国政府也决不认为，那些并无恶意的人们对于中国的误解，也会同样长久地继续下去。因为，中国如果真是在侵略和威胁印度或其他国家，否认一万次也不能改变事实；如果事实不是这样，那么，即使有一万个宣传机器在全世界宣传中国的“侵略”和“威胁”，也只能使那些宣传家自己丧失信用。“路遥知马力，事久见人心。”中国对于印度的和平友好态度是经得起时间的考验的。中国政府相信，事实的真相可以在短时期受到掩盖，在长时期掩盖它是不可能的。
    只要双方都以两国友好根本利益为重，采取互谅互让态度，边界争执不难解决。中国政府希望两国总理的会谈能首先就边界问题取得一些原则性的协议，在边界划定以前双方边境武装部队各自后撤，并且作为先行步骤在全部边境停止巡逻
   （5）解决中印边界问题的关键在哪里。
    中印两国政府对于边界问题的立场有重要的分歧，两国在边境上也还存在着紧张的局势。但是中国政府从来不怀疑，紧张的局势终将过去，边境问题也会通过友好的协商求得合理解决。
    中国政府的信念是由于：两国有千百年友好的历史，没有不可调和的冲突，双方都迫切地需要专心致志于国内的长期的和平建设，而且都愿意为维护世界和平而努力，老是这样地争论不休是没有理由的，也是难于想像的。在边界问题上，双方都曾经表示愿意维持边界的现状，愿意用和平的方法解决边界争端。这就说明，中印两国友好相处是有基础的，边界问题是可以合理地加以解决的。而且从反面来看，除此以外也不存在其他的选择。双方既不可能改变彼此为邻的地理现实，也不可能在漫长的边界线上断绝交往，更不可能荒谬地设想，我们两个共有十亿多人口的伟大的友好邻邦，会为这种暂时的、局部的争端而发动战争。因此，以和平的方法、友好地解决边界争端，是唯一合乎逻辑的结论。
    什么是当前急待解决的关键问题呢？中国政府谨向印度政府提出以下的意见：
    甲、中国政府认为，不论双方对边界的某种具体的事实可能有这样或那样的看法，但是，对于一个最基本的、全世界都知道的事实应该不再有任何分歧，这就是两国之间的整个边界确实从来没有划定过，因此，它还有待通过谈判来加以解决。接受这样一个简单的事实，不应该为双方产生任何困难，因为它既不损害任何一方的现实利益，也丝毫不约束双方在边界谈判中提出自己的主张。一旦就这一点取得一致意见，可以说，解决边界问题的门径就已经打开。对于边界各段的具体争执，虽然至今双方各执一词，但是只要双方都以两国友好的根本利益为重，采取不带偏见和互谅互让的态度，这些争执是不难解决的。如果印度的意见证明更有理由，更有利于两国的友好，中国就应该接受；如果中国的意见证明更有理由，更有利于两国的友好，印度就应该接受。中国政府希望，两国总理不久以后的会晤能首先就边界问题取得一些原则性的协议，为双方今后的讨论和拟制解决方案提供指导和基础。
    乙、在边界正式划定以前，必须有效地维持两国边界的现状和确保边境的安谧。为了这个目的，中国政府建议：在边境上的双方武装部队各自后撤二十公里或者其他双方认为适当的距离；并且作为这一根本措施的先行步骤，双方武装人员在全部边境停止巡逻。
    中国政府相信，如果能就以上两点达成协议，中印边境的局势就将立刻改观，笼罩着两国关系的阴云也会迅速消散。
    中国政府殷切地期望，它在这里不厌其烦地申述的对于中印边界问题的过去、现在和将来的观点，能够得到印度政府的最善意的了解，从而有助于这一问题的双方满意的解决和两国关系的好转。尽管为了答复不公正的指责，不得不进行若干争论，但是中国政府的意愿和目的不是争论，而是争论的结束。
    中印两国是两个伟大的国家，都有伟大的过去和将来。几年来，根据和平共处五项原则的伟大理想，两国曾经为维护世界和平亲密地携手合作。今天，历史又向两国人民发出了召唤，要求他们在完成国内的巨大变革的同时，在国际上为和平和人类进步做出更大的贡献。落在中印两国这一代肩上的任务是艰巨的，也是光荣的。中国政府在此谨重申自己的热烈愿望：两国将停止争吵，迅速地使边界问题得到合理的解决，并且在这个基础上巩固和发展两国人民在共同事业中的伟大友谊。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
