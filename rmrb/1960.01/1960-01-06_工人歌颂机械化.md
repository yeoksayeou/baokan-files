Workers Sing Praises of Mechanization
    (I) Transport workers have great enthusiasm, and are not afraid of any difficulties; vigorously promoting mechanization to welcome the New Year, throwing away the old oxen and straddling swift horses.
    (II) Conveyor belts, showing their power, running back and forth like giant dragons. The long dragon replaces two legs, increasing efficiency more than fourfold.
    (III) Casting workers have achieved mechanization, improving efficiency remarkably. No need to lift materials to the furnace, no need to brush small parts to remove sand. Mechanized sand screening has more than tripled efficiency. Safe casting and transportation, everyone claps their hands and laughs happily.

    工人歌颂机械化
    （一）运输工人干劲大，天大困难也不怕；大搞机械迎新年，抛掉老牛跨骏马。
    （二）传送带，显威风，跑来跑去像巨龙。长龙代替两条腿，翻上四番还有零。
    （三）铸工实现机械化，提高效率顶呱呱。大炉上料不用抬，小件清砂不用刷。筛砂实现机械化，翻上两番还要加。浇铸运输保安全，人人拍手笑哈哈。
