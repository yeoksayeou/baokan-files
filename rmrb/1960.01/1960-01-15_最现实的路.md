　　The Most Realistic Path

　　This year, China's light industry, together with heavy industry, will continue to develop by leaps and bounds. How can we achieve rapid development? The answer is: we still need to "walk on two legs." Foreign methods are certainly good, but local methods are also acceptable. For example, machinery and equipment are needed by all walks of life. However, the machinery manufacturing industry cannot produce so many machines at present. What should we do? "Close down" and "dismount," acting as deserters in the face of difficulties? Wait for foreign equipment, acting as lazybones in the face of difficulties? Of course, both are wrong. There is only one correct path, which is to use foreign methods where possible, and local methods where foreign methods are not possible, to seize technical innovation, and actively and gradually transition from "local" to "foreign." The Shucheng Paper Mill, after a period of twists and turns, found this correct path, enabling a new workshop to be put into production quickly. This event shows that areas and units lacking the conditions for foreign methods of production should first engage in local methods of production, and gradually transition from local to foreign. This is the most realistic path to develop light industry and other industries in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    最现实的路
    今年，我国的轻工业，将和重工业一起，继续飞跃地向前发展。怎样做到发展得快呢？答曰：还是要“两条腿走路”。洋法固然好，土法也要得。例如，机器设备是各行各业都需要的。但目前机械制造业不可能生产出这样多的机器来。怎么办呢？“收摊子”“下马”，作困难面前的逃兵么？坐等洋设备，作困难面前的懒汉么？当然都不对。正确的道路只有一条，就是能洋则洋，不能洋则土，抓紧技术革新，积极地逐步地从“土”过渡到“洋”。舒城纸厂经过一段曲折，找到了这条正确的路，使一个新车间迅速投入了生产。这件事说明：缺乏洋法生产条件的地区和单位，先搞土法生产，逐步由土到洋，是多快好省地发展轻工业和其他工业的一条最现实的路。
