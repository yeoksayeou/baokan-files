Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: TASS Moscow, January 19th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers issued a resolution on further improving medical facilities and protecting the health of Soviet residents.

The resolution pointed out that the Soviet government will use the funds saved from the further reduction of the armed forces to improve medical facilities for residents. During the period from 1961 to 1965, the total state investment in the construction of healthcare institutions, pharmaceutical industrial enterprises, and scientific research institutions will be 1.8 billion rubles more than the original investment planned in the Seven-Year Plan.

The resolution stipulates that by 1965, the total number of hospital beds in the Soviet Union should increase by 616,000, the output of medicines, medical devices, and other medical equipment should increase by 2.5 times compared to last year, and the output of medical equipment using radioactive electronics and nuclear physics therapies should increase by 5 to 12 times.

The resolution also requires scientific institutions to pay close attention to solving the following most important problems: researching effective prevention methods, medical methods, and medicines for cardiovascular diseases, influenza, angina, skin diseases, and other diseases; researching the causes of cancer and formulating preventive measures.

Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: TASS Moscow, January 20th: A meeting of activists of officers of the Moscow Garrison was held in Moscow on January 19 to discuss the resolutions of the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Marshal Malinovsky, Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, delivered a report at the meeting.

Malinovsky explained in detail the resolutions of the Fourth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He called on all officer activists in the Moscow Military District to thoroughly study Khrushchev's report on disarmament at this meeting, so that every member of the troops can understand the content of the report.

Malinovsky also talked about some issues in the current international situation. He said that in international life, there is a tendency for the tense situation to further ease. However, we should not forget that influential "Cold War" forces are still active in the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The warmth that has appeared in international relations does not suit their tastes. They are maintaining world tension and insisting on the arms race. In the United States, the main advocates of this policy are Rockefeller, Truman, and Acheson. Malinovsky said that US President Eisenhower's recent statement is also regrettable, because although we have firmly announced to the world that we will never be the first to start testing atomic weapons, he announced that the United States refuses to extend the moratorium on testing atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Malinovsky continued that this reduction of the Soviet armed forces will not weaken the main thing in its strength—firepower. Then, Malinovsky talked about some of the tasks and dates for implementing the law on the further large-scale reduction of the Soviet army and navy. He said that we should basically implement this law in 1960 and 1961, and complete the entire reduction work by the autumn of 1961. In implementing the plan to reduce the armed forces, we must disband and abolish some troops, corps, warehouses, bases, armories, military schools, and greatly reduce administrative organs. More than 250,000 officers and generals will be relieved of their duties from the armed forces. Malinovsky then spoke about the preferential treatment for servicemen transferred to the reserve and called on them to stand at the forefront of communist construction.

    苏共中央和部长会议通过决议
    裁军节省的部分资金用于保健事业
    马利诺夫斯基斥西方冷战势力坚持军备竞赛
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议发表了关于进一步改善医疗设施和保护苏联居民健康的措施的决议。
    决议指出，苏联政府将把从再次裁减武装部队而节省下来的资金用于改善居民的医疗设施。在1961年到1965年期间，国家用于建设保健机构、医药工业企业、科学研究机关的投资总额将比七年计划原定的投资多十八亿卢布。
    决议规定，到1965年苏联的病床总数应增加六十一万六千个，药品、医疗器械和其他医疗器材的产量应比去年增加二点五倍，采用放射性电子、核物理疗法的医疗器械的产量应增加五倍至十二倍。
    决议还要求科学机构密切注意解决下列最重要的问题：研究心脏血管病、流行性感冒、咽峡炎、皮肤病和其他疾病的有效的预防方法、医疗方法和药品，研究癌瘤病产生的原因并制定预防措施。
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：1月19日在莫斯科举行了莫斯科卫戍部队军官积极分子会议，讨论苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议的决议。苏联国防部部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在会上作了报告。
    马利诺夫斯基详细地讲述了苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议的决议。他号召莫斯科军区全体军官积极分子深入研究赫鲁晓夫在这个会议所作的关于裁军问题的报告，使部队的每一个成员都领会这个报告的内容。
    马利诺夫斯基还谈到了当前国际局势的某些问题。他说，在国际生活中，紧张局势有进一步缓和的趋势。但是，我们也不应该忘记，在北大西洋公约组织的国家里，有影响的“冷战”势力还在进行活动。国际关系中出现的暖和是不合他们的口味的。他们在保持世界的紧张局势和坚持军备竞赛。在美国这一政策的主要鼓吹者有洛克菲勒、杜鲁门、艾奇逊。马利诺夫斯基说，美国总统艾森豪威尔最近的声明也是令人遗憾的，因为虽然我们已向全世界坚定地宣布，我们决不首先开始试验原子武器，但是，他却宣布美国拒绝延长停止试验原子武器和氢武器的期限。
    马利诺夫斯基接着说，苏联这次裁减武装部队丝毫也不会削弱其实力中的主要东西——火力。接着，马利诺夫斯基谈到执行再次大量裁减苏联陆海军的法律的一些任务和日期。他说，我们应当在1960年到1961年基本上实现这项法律，到1961年秋天完成整个裁减工作。在执行裁减武装部队的计划时，我们必须解散和撤销一些部队、兵团、仓库、基地、武器库、军事学校，大量裁减管理机构。将从各武装部队中解脱二十五万多名军官和将军的职务。马利诺夫斯基接着谈到对转入后备役的军人的优待，并号召他们站在共产主义建设的最前列。
