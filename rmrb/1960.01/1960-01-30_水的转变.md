The Transformation of Water
Liu Hong

Water, once brought disaster and suffering to the people.
Water, now brings happiness and joy to the people.

From Yu the Great's flood control to the last year of reactionary rule, for thousands of years, people have been fighting floods for a long time, trying to make the water obey their commands and serve mankind. However, despite the struggles, disasters still came, and countless lives and properties were still taken away by floods.

From the day the people became masters of their own affairs, the Party and Chairman Mao led us to harness mountains and rivers, "We must repair the Huai River!" With a loud roar, the will of the people across the country was inspired to not only repair the Huai River, but also the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and all the large and small rivers across the country. Ten years have passed, a short time, but achievements have been made that have not been achieved in thousands of years. Floods also came to test us, droughts also came to test us, but we answered with a bumper harvest. People cheered excitedly: Look, we have conquered the water, how obedient it is!

I have looked through the "Chronicle of Huai River". In the Qing Dynasty alone, from the early years of Emperor Shizu—Shunzhi to the third year of Xuantong, the records of water disasters had no blank year. The technical conditions for water control at that time were certainly poor; but the continuous disasters were mainly due to the ruling class only caring about plundering the people's wealth and not caring about the people's suffering at all, let alone water control. Cruel incidents of the ruling class releasing water to harm the people are also common in history. According to the record of the third year of Xianfeng: "The Cantonese rebels captured Yangzhou, to prevent them from fleeing north, all the sluice gates were opened and the water of the Huai River was drained, causing the rebel ships to stagnate..." According to the record of the fifth year of Xianfeng: "In June, the Yellow River burst at Tongwaxiang, Lankao County, flowing in three streams... At that time, military affairs were flourishing, so it was not blocked and moved." The third year of Xianfeng was the time when the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom captured Nanjing and marched north. The Qing Dynasty was shaking. Since it was necessary to "drain the water of the Huai River" to resist the revolutionary forces of the people, it was certainly not going to block the opening of the Yellow River. This could not help but remind me of Chiang Kai-shek's digging the Huayuankou dike in 1938 and blocking the Huayuankou dike in 1947 and attempting to re-dig the opening from Sanyizhai in Lankao County. Digging and blocking, in order to maintain reactionary rule, they did not hesitate to flood back and forth, ruining the great rivers and mountains into a bankrupt situation where disasters occurred whether it rained or not. The Henan folk song "Four Wastes in Henan, Water, Drought, Locusts, and Soup" also shows that the people at that time had realized that the rule of the Kuomintang was one of the causes of the disaster. The reactionary rulers were actually the culprits of water disasters.

For the happiness of future generations, the Party and Chairman Mao led the people to start an earth-shattering feat. In the very place where the "water of the Huai River was drained" in those years, in the very place where the dike was dug and blocked in those years, sluice gates were built, so that the Yellow River water obediently listened to the people's commands, irrigating, generating electricity, and navigating, nurturing the areas that the Yellow River had flooded, and benefiting the people who had suffered disasters.

Today, we should re-establish files for water. In the new files, it should be written in large letters: Drought and flood disasters will disappear from our generation, and people will conquer nature with their own strength. The times have changed. This is the era when the working people are masters of their own affairs, the era when the people are organized to overcome natural disasters with collective strength, and the era of mass movements to "repair the earth"; society has changed. Our society is a society of people's communes that can fully organize and give full play to the people's strength, a society that realizes socialist revolution and builds socialism; our 600 million people have also changed. These are people who have established the idea that man will conquer nature and the great ambition to change the appearance of mountains and rivers, people who have fully liberated their minds and established a communist style. From this, we have also found the true source of happiness. The source of this happiness is our Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, the leadership of the Party and the Party's general line, the people's communes and the Great Leap Forward, and the soaring drive and creative ability of 600 million people.

    水的转变
    柳泓
    水，曾经给人们带来灾荒和苦难。
    水，如今给人们带来了幸福和欢乐。
    从大禹治水到反动统治者最后结束的一个年头，几千年的时间里，人们曾经和洪水进行长期的搏斗，力求让水听自己使唤，为人类服务。可是，搏斗尽管搏斗，灾难还是不断来临，无数的生命财产还是被洪水夺走。
    从人民当家作主那一天起，党和毛主席就领导我们治山治水，“一定要把淮河修好”！一声巨响，振奋起全国人民的意志，不但要把淮河修好，而且要把黄河、长江，把全国所有的大小江河都要修好。十年过去了，时间不算长，却做出了几千年来所没有做到的成就。涝灾也来考验，旱灾也来考验，但是，我们用丰收作了回答。人们兴奋地欢呼：看，水被我们治服了，它多么听话呀！
    我翻看过“淮系年表”。仅仅清朝一个朝代，从清世祖——顺治初年到宣统三年，水患的记录没有一年空白过。当时人们治水的技术条件固然较差；但连年遭受灾害，主要是统治阶级只顾搜括民脂民膏，根本不关心人民生活的疾苦，当然更谈不上治水。历史上统治阶级放水害民的惨酷事件也是屡见不鲜的。据咸丰三年记载：“粤逆陷扬州，防其北窜，启放各闸坝，泄尽淮水，使贼舟停滞……”。又据咸丰五年记载：“六月，黄河大决兰考县铜瓦厢、溜分三股……时军务繁兴，不塞遂徙”。咸丰三年正是太平天国打下南京进军北上的时候，清皇朝摇摇晃晃，既然要“泄尽淮水”抵挡人民的革命势力，当然不会去堵塞黄河开了的口子。这不禁使我联想起蒋介石在1938年扒开花园口和1947年堵塞花园口并企图从兰考县三义寨重新扒口的事情。扒扒堵堵，为了保持反动统治，不惜用水淹来淹去，把个大好河山，糟蹋成有雨无雨都成灾的破产局面。“河南四荒，水旱蝗汤”的河南民谣，也说明当时的人民已经认识到国民党的统治是造成灾害的原因之一了。反动统治者实际上是水患的祸首。
    为了子孙万代的幸福，党和毛主席领导人民开始了惊天动地的壮举。就在当年“泄尽淮水”的地方，在当年扒口堵口的地方，兴修起了闸坝，让黄河水乖乖地听人民使唤，灌溉、发电、航运，哺育黄河泛滥过的地区，造福给受过灾难的人民。
    如今，我们应该为水重新制定档案了。在新的档案里，要大书特书地记上：旱涝灾害将从我们这一代开始消失，人们用自己的力量征服了自然。时代改变了，这已经是劳动人民当家作主的时代，是人民组织起来用集体力量战胜天灾的时代，是大搞“修理地球”的群众运动的时代；社会变了，我们的社会是一个能够充分组织和发挥人民力量的人民公社的社会，是实现社会主义革命和建设社会主义的社会；我们六亿人也变了，这是树立人定胜天思想和改变山河面貌的大志的人，是充分解放了思想和树立了共产主义风格的人。由此，我们也找到了真正的幸福根源，这幸福的根源是我们的党和伟大的领袖毛主席，是党的领导和党的总路线，是人民公社和大跃进，是六亿人的冲天干劲和创造能力。
