New Year New Construction

    Changchun Iron Oxen Leave the Factory in Batches
    The Changchun Tractor Factory, which is under construction, produced its first batch of twenty-two tractors at the end of last year.
    The Changchun Tractor Factory is a medium-sized modern tractor manufacturing plant that began construction in August 1958. The Iron Ox—Type 40 tractor it produces is a 40-horsepower rubber-tired universal tractor suitable for farming, harrowing, sowing, weeding, and harvesting in the Northeast region. It can tow fertilizer applicators and three-blade mowers; if a power output pulley is installed, it can also be used for irrigation, threshing, and power generation.

    长春铁牛成批出栏
    建设中的长春拖拉机制造厂，已在去年底制出第一批二十二台拖拉机。
    长春拖拉机厂是一九五八年八月动工兴建的一座中等规模的现代化拖拉机制造厂。它生产的铁牛——四十型拖拉机，是一种装有四十匹马力的胶轮式万能拖拉机，适合于东北地区的耕地、耙地、播种、除草、收割等农活；能拖挂追肥机、三刀割草机；如果安上动力输出皮带轮，还可以用来排灌、脱谷和发电。
