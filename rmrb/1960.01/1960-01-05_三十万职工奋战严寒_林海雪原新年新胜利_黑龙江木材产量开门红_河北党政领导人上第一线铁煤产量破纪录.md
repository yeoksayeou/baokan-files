Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th: Three hundred thousand forestry workers fighting in the forests of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Wanda Mountains, with soaring revolutionary vigor, have achieved a flying start in the severe cold of around minus 30 degrees Celsius. The average daily output of timber on the 1st and 2nd was 1.7 times higher than the same period in January last year, and 68% higher than the average daily output in early December last year, changing the situation where the output at the beginning of the year was lower than the end of the previous year.

Having exceeded and comprehensively completed the state's timber production plan last year, the forest areas in Heilongjiang Province have persisted in putting politics in command and launching a vigorous mass movement on the basis of victory. During the New Year's Day period, they generally strengthened the leadership on the production front line. Party and government leading cadres of various forestry bureaus went deep into the forest farms to fight alongside the workers and spend the New Year together, which greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the workers and made production leap forward again and again. After more than 400 people, including the party committee secretaries, ministers, forestry bureau chiefs, and section cadres of the thirteen forestry bureaus in the Yichun forest area, went deep into the forest farms to participate in production guidance, they greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers, making the average daily output of the entire forest area on the 1st and 2nd exceed the original plan by 36.7%, and 3.8 times higher than the same period in January last year.

In order to achieve a good start, a daily red, a full-month red, and a good start for the first quarter of this year, the forest areas started various preparations as early as October last year. The machinery that should be repaired in various forest areas has been basically repaired. At the same time, the work of winter timber collection and transportation in the mountains has been strengthened. A large amount of timber felled in the mountains has been transported to the sides of forest railways and highways, laying a material foundation for this year's good start.

While grasping the good start, various forest areas also mobilized workers to discuss the state plan for the first quarter, so that everyone knew what was in their minds. When discussing the plan, the forestry workers in the Mudanjiang area also proposed specific measures to complete the plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, ensuring a good start and a comprehensive red this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th: "A spring breeze overnight, red flowers bloom everywhere." The steelmaking and coal mining workers in Hebei Province have launched a large-scale high-yield competition of "a good start and a daily full house red" since zero on New Year's Day, continuing to leap forward in production.

From the 1st to the 3rd, the average daily output of pig iron in the province increased by 19.8% compared with the average daily output in December last year; the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces reached 1.13, and the consumption of coke per ton of iron smelted was reduced by an average of 15.45% compared with December last year; the average daily output of coal in the province also increased by 5.1% compared with December last year.

Before the New Year, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, the workers in the iron and coal industry in Hebei Province launched a debate on the topics of "Can we continue to leap forward in 1960?" and "How to ensure a good start and a daily red?", further boosting their energy and launching a cross-year high-yield competition centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. In the competition, the workers of Linshui Iron Plant carried out technological transformation of small blast furnaces, realizing strong wind, high temperature, and heavy-load operation. From the 1st to the 3rd, they overfulfilled the production plan every day. The average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the whole plant reached more than 2.5, the coke ratio dropped to below 0.7, and all the produced iron was first-class. The workers of Fengfeng Coal Mine promoted 37 kinds of advanced experiences. From the 1st to the 3rd, the output of raw coal increased by 5.9% compared with December last year. Zhang Enxiao, the captain of the red flag tunneling team of this mine, studied and promoted the use of pliers to punch holes and hydraulic transportation with the workers, completing the task of three shifts in one shift. Handan Iron and Steel Company did a good job in preparation, with sufficient raw materials, well-maintained equipment, and strong worker enthusiasm. Therefore, the daily output of pig iron from the 1st to the 3rd increased by an average of 28.8% compared with December last year. Wang Yonglu, a furnace worker, wrote a poem in front of the furnace: "I am the party's steel soldier, I am happy to spend the New Year in front of the furnace, Produce more good iron to celebrate the New Year, In the future, we will definitely guarantee a daily red."

In the past few days, secretaries of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, secretaries of local party committees and municipal party committees, and party and government leaders of various factories and mines have gone to the production front line to fight alongside the workers by the blast furnace or in the mine, discovering problems and solving them immediately, which greatly boosted the enthusiasm of the workers.

    三十万职工奋战严寒  林海雪原新年新胜利
    黑龙江木材产量开门红
    河北党政领导人上第一线铁煤产量破纪录
    新华社哈尔滨4日电　战斗在大小兴安岭和完达山脉林海中的三十万林业职工，以冲天的革命干劲，在零下三十度左右的严寒里，夺取了开门红。1日、2日两天木材的平均日产量，比去年1月同期增加一点七倍，比去年12月初的平均日产量也高68％，改变了历年来年初产量低于上年末的状况。
    去年超额、全面完成国家木材生产计划的黑龙江省各林区，在胜利的基础上，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，在元旦期间普遍加强了生产第一线的领导，各林业局的党、政领导干部深入各林场与工人并肩作战，同度新年，大大鼓舞了职工的生产热情，使生产一跃再跃。伊春林区十三个林业局的党委书记、部长、林业局长和科室干部等四百多人，深入各林场参加生产指导生产后，大大激发了职工的干劲，使全林区1日、2日的平均日产量超过原订计划36．7％，比去年1月同期提高三点八倍多。
    为实现今年开门红、日日红、全月红、首季满堂红，各林区早在去年10月就开始各项准备工作。各林区应进行检修的机械都基本作到了检修。同时，还加强了山中冬季集运木材的工作。把山上伐倒的木材大量运到森林铁路和汽车公路旁边，为今年开门红奠定了物质基础。
    各林区在大抓开门红的同时，还发动职工讨论了第一季度国家计划，使职工人人心中有数。牡丹江地区林业职工在讨论计划时，还提出了按日按旬按月完成计划的具体措施，保证了今年开门红、全面红。
    新华社天津4日电　“一夜春风过，遍地红花开”。河北省的炼铁、采煤工人，从元旦零点开始掀起的“开门日日满堂红”大面积高产竞赛，使生产继续跃进。
    1日至3日，全省生铁平均日产量比去年12月份平均日产量提高19．8％；小高炉利用系数达到一点一三，每炼一吨铁耗用焦炭比去年12月份平均降低15．45％；全省煤炭平均日产量也比去年12月份提高了5．1％。
    河北省炼铁、煤炭工业的职工，年前在各级党委领导下，就以“1960年能不能继续跃进”、“如何保证开门日日红”为题，展开了鸣放辩论，进一步鼓足了干劲，开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的骑年跨月大面积高产竞赛。临水铁厂职工在竞赛中，对小高炉进行技术改造，实现了强风高温重负荷操作，1至3日天天超额完成生产计划，全厂小高炉平均利用系数达到二点五以上，焦比降到零点七以下，所产生铁全部是一级品。峰峰煤矿职工推行了三十七种先进经验，1至3日的原煤产量比去年12月份提高5．9％。这个矿的红旗掘进队队长张恩孝，和工人一起研究推广了扛钳子打眼和水力运输，一班就完成了三班的任务。邯郸钢铁公司的准备工作做得好，原料充足，设备检修的好，职工干劲很足，1至3日的生铁日产量因此比去年12月平均提高28．8％。炉前工王永禄在炉前写了一首诗：“我是党的钢铁兵，炉前过年喜盈盈，多产好铁庆新年，今后定保日日红。”
    这几天，中共河北省委书记处书记，各地委、市委书记，以及各厂矿的党、政负责干部，都到生产第一线，与工人一道奋战在高炉炉旁或矿井下，发现问题立即解决，大大鼓舞了职工们的干劲。
