    Fully Utilize Fujian's Hydropower Resources
    Jianxi Large-Scale Power Station Begins Construction
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 5th. The Jianxi Hydropower Station in Fujian Province, which will be equipped with a one million kilowatt generator, officially began construction recently. This is one of the large-scale hydropower stations currently under construction in China, following the commencement of the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia hydropower stations on the Yellow River. Upon completion, it will have eight hydro-turbine generators with a total capacity of one million kilowatts, generating 4.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually.
    Jianxi is one of the three major tributaries of the Min River. The main structures of the hydropower station include a concrete dam, the main powerhouse, a step-up switchyard, and construction diversion tunnels.
    Under the leadership of the Party, the construction department began preparatory work for the power station as early as October 1958. The workers building the power station have already completed the construction diversion tunnels, excavated more than two million cubic meters of earth and stone, and built 170,000 square meters of office buildings and workers' dormitories.
    At the opening ceremony, Zhang Hanying, Vice Minister of Water Resources and Electric Power, and Xu Ya, Standing Committee Member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Governor of Fujian Province, delivered speeches. Zhang Hanying pointed out in his speech that Fujian Province is one of the provinces with the richest hydropower resources in China. The construction of the Jianxi Hydropower Station and the full development of Fujian's hydropower resources are of great significance for accelerating Fujian's socialist construction and the national electric power industry. Xu Ya said in his speech that after the completion of the Jianxi Hydropower Station, it will create extremely favorable conditions for the high-speed development of Fujian's industrial and agricultural production, fundamentally changing the backward state of Fujian's industry, and accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification. Rossibov, the representative of the Soviet experts who participated in the survey and design work of the Jianxi Hydropower Station, also spoke at the meeting. He warmly congratulated the official commencement of the Jianxi Hydropower Station and the achievements of China's electric power industry. (Attached picture)

    充分利用福建水力资源
    建溪大型电站动工
    新华社福州5日电　将安装百万瓩发电机的福建省建溪水电站在最近正式施工。这是继黄河三门峡、刘家峡等大型水电站开工之后，我国目前兴建的大型水电站之一。它全部建成以后，可以安装八台共计一百万瓩的水轮发电机，每年能发出四十二亿度的电力。
    建溪是闽江三大支流之一。水电站主要工程有混凝土拦河大坝，主厂房，升压开关站和施工导流隧洞等。
    在党的领导下，施工部门早在1958年10月就开始了建站施工准备工作。建设电站的职工们已经提前打通了施工导流隧洞，开挖了二百多万立方米土石方，并且建好了十七万平方米的办公楼和职工宿舍。
    在开工典礼的大会上，水利电力部副部长张含英，中共福建省委常委、福建省副省长许亚等，都讲了话。张含英在讲话中指出，福建省是我国水力资源最丰富的省份之一。建溪水电站的兴建和充分开发福建水力资源，对于加速福建社会主义建设和全国电力工业建设都有很大意义。许亚在讲话中说，建溪水电站建成以后，将为高速度发展福建省工农业生产，根本改变福建工业落后面貌，加速实现农业机械化、水利化、电气化，创造极为有利的条件。参加建溪水电站勘察设计工作的苏联专家代表罗西包夫也在会上讲了话。他热烈祝贺建溪水电站正式开工和我国电力工业建设的成就。（附图片）
