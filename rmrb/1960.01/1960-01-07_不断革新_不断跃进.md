    Constantly Innovate, Constantly Leap Forward

    A little over a month ago, this newspaper published news about the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir construction site in Jiangxi Province, which was vigorously carrying out tool reforms and increasing work efficiency by dozens of times. The Ziyun Mountain Reservoir has become a red flag on the water conservancy front for carrying out the high work efficiency movement. It makes people clearly see that reforming tools is the most fundamental way to accelerate engineering construction, improve labor efficiency, and reduce labor intensity. Today, new good news has come from Ziyun Mountain again. After increasing work efficiency by dozens of times, they have further strengthened leadership, constantly reforming, and continuously reforming, and carried out comprehensive technological innovation for each work process, and the soil transportation efficiency has increased by more than double.

    The spirit of Ziyun Mountain Reservoir construction site's continuous pursuit of perfection in tool reform, never stopping, constantly innovating, and constantly leaping forward, is a microcosm of the high work efficiency movement carried out on thousands of water conservancy construction sites across the country. From here, we once again see the ambition of millions of migrant workers on the entire water conservancy front to use the spirit of continuous revolution to improve work efficiency, accelerate progress, and strive for continued leap forward in agricultural production this year. When the water conservancy construction sites across the country started construction last winter, the average daily work efficiency was only about one cubic meter. Now, after only two months, it has rapidly increased to four cubic meters. The average daily work efficiency in Anhui Province has increased to more than ten cubic meters, and Henan Province has also reached more than nine cubic meters.

    The tool reform and technological innovation movement is a process of continuous improvement from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level, from indigenous to foreign, step by step, continuously developing, and never stopping. Our goal is to first use simple machinery (i.e., indigenous machinery) to replace manual operation, and use tools with higher work efficiency to replace tools with lower work efficiency, so that the construction process gradually achieves semi-mechanization and mechanization. Because most of the labor on our water conservancy construction sites is still manual operation and heavy physical labor, the potential to be tapped in this area is huge, so continuous technological innovation is even more necessary. Where to start with tool reform? Many construction sites first seized the link of the soil transportation process, which consumes the most labor and has the greatest labor intensity, and carried out tool reform vigorously, achieving "flying in the sky" and "running on the ground," eliminating manual carrying, realizing vehicle-ization and simple mechanization, and significantly improving work efficiency. However, things cannot stop there. Breaking through one point does not mean conquering the entire front. Improving the work efficiency of one work process does not mean improving the work efficiency of the entire project. Therefore, we should quickly expand the results after breaking through one point, so that all work processes such as digging, loading, transporting, unloading, filling, and compacting can be reformed, adapt to each other, and develop in a balanced manner. The Ziyun Mountain Reservoir is an example in this regard. After the tool reform was implemented in the soil transportation process, this construction site immediately reformed the soil loading tools, so that the loading and transportation processes were closely connected, simplifying the intermediate transfer process. At the same time, they also adopted the method of gunpowder blasting to extract soil, so that the soil digging efficiency caught up with the continuously improving soil transportation efficiency, realizing the innovation of all work processes and accelerating the progress of the entire project. Not only that, they also carried out technological innovation in the design, revised the original design, which not only ensured the quality of the project, but also saved a lot of engineering materials, so that the reservoir could be completed on schedule. The reason why they were able to do this is precisely because they possess the spirit of continuous revolution. They are not satisfied with the existing achievements, but push the technological innovation movement to a new stage step by step.

    At present, water conservancy construction is in a tense stage in most parts of the country, and carrying out the high work efficiency movement is the center of current water conservancy work. Therefore, in all places, we should not be satisfied with some of the existing achievements in tool reform, but like the Ziyun Mountain Reservoir, expand from the reform of one work process to the innovation of all work processes, and gradually improve from simple machinery to more advanced machinery, so that we can continuously improve work efficiency and reduce labor intensity. At present, the average work efficiency of water conservancy construction sites across the country is more than twice as low as the advanced levels of Anhui and Henan. If it can be generally improved to the level of Anhui and Henan, work efficiency can be improved by another half. We hope that all water conservancy construction sites can, in the spirit of continuous revolution, quickly make comprehensive arrangements, seize one link, link each link tightly, promote the realization of technological innovation in all construction processes, continuously improve work efficiency, and let water conservancy construction write the first chapter of victory for the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1960.

### 不断革新　不断跃进

    不断革新　不断跃进
    一个多月以前，本报发表了江西紫云山水库工地大搞工具改革、提高工效数十倍的消息。紫云山水库已成为水利战线上开展高工效运动的一面红旗。它使人们鲜明地看到改革工具是加快工程建设、提高劳动效率和减轻劳动强度的最根本的途径。今天，从紫云山又传来新的捷报，他们在提高工效数十倍以后，进一步加强领导，不停地改，不断地改，对于各个工序进行了全面的技术革新，运土工效又提高一倍以上。
    紫云山水库工地对工具改革这种精益求精、永不停息、不断革新、不断跃进的精神，正是全国千千万万水利工地上开展高工效运动的一幅缩影。从这里，我们又一次看到了整个水利战线上千百万民工用不断革命的精神来提高工效、加快进度，力争今年农业生产继续跃进的雄心大志。全国水利工地在去冬开始施工时平均日工效只有一方上下，现在经过短短的两个多月，已迅速提高到四方。安徽省的平均日工效更提高到十方以上，河南省也达到九方以上。
    工具改革和技术革新运动，是一个由简单到复杂、由低级到高级、由土到洋、步步提高、不断发展、永不停息的过程。我们的目标是首先用简易机械（即土机械）来代替手工操作，用工效较高的工具来代替工效较低的工具，使施工过程逐步实现半机械化和机械化。由于目前我们水利工地绝大部分的劳动还是手工操作和笨重的体力劳动，这方面可挖的潜力极大，因此更需要进行不断的技术革新。改革工具从哪里入手？很多工地首先抓住用劳力最多、劳动强度最大的运工工序这一环，狠狠进行了工具改革，做到了“天上飞”、“地上跑”，取消了人力挑抬，实现了车子化和简易机械化，工效显著提高。但是，事情不能就此为止，突破一点不等于攻破全线，提高一个工序的工效，更不等于提高全部工程的工效。因此，我们应当在突破一点之后迅速扩大战果，使挖土、装土、运土、卸土、填土、打夯等各个工序全部革新，互相适应，以求平衡地发展。紫云山水库在这个方面正是一个榜样。这个工地在运土工序实行了工具改革以后，紧接着便改革了装土工具，使装和运两个工序紧相衔接，简化了中间的转运过程。与此同时，他们还采用火药爆破方法取土，使挖土的工效赶上了不断提高的运土工效，实现了全部工序的革新，加快了整个工程的进度。不仅如此，他们在设计方面也进行了技术革新，修改了原有的设计，既保证了工程质量，又节约了大量的工程器材，使水库能按期完工。他们所以能够这样做，正因为他们具备了不断革命的精神，他们不满足于已有的成就，而是将技术革新运动一步进一步地推向新的阶段。
    现在，全国绝大部分地区水利施工正处在紧张阶段，开展高工效运动是当前水利工作的中心。因此，在各个地方，都不应满足于工具改革的已有的一些成绩，而要像紫云山水库那样，从一个工序的改革扩展到全部工序的革新，从简易的机械逐步提高到更先进的机械，这样才能不断地提高工效，减轻劳动强度。现在全国水利工地的平均工效比起先进水平的安徽和河南来，相差一倍还多，如果能普遍提高到安徽、河南的水平，工效又可以提高一半。我们希望各个水利工地都能本着不断革命的精神，迅速作好全面的安排，抓住一环，环环扣紧，促进全部施工工序实现技术革新，不断地提高工效，让水利建设为1960年农业生产的大跃进写下胜利的第一章。
