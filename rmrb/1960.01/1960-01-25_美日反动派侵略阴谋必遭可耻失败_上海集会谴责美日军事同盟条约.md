Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 24th: People from all walks of life in Shanghai held a solemn rally this afternoon, strongly condemning and resolutely opposing the US-Japan military alliance treaty, warmly supporting the Chinese Foreign Ministry's January 14th statement opposing the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

    Jin Zhonghua, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. He said: The US-Japan "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security" is a thorough and aggressive military alliance treaty. The signing of this treaty marks the revival of Japanese militarism under the support of US imperialism and its open participation in the aggressive military bloc led by the United States. The purpose of this treaty is to prepare for a new war of aggression, with its spearhead aimed at the people of China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and other Asian countries, thus seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. The signing of this treaty will drag the Japanese people onto a disastrous path of war, which is completely contrary to the will of the Japanese people.

    Jin Zhonghua pointed out that the signing of this treaty further exposes the recent "false peace, real war preparation" conspiracy tricks played by US imperialism. The ferocious and evil aggressive face of US imperialism has been more fully exposed to the people of the world.

    Jin Zhonghua said: We have always strictly distinguished between the Japanese people and the Japanese militarists. In the struggle to smash the conspiracy of Nobusuke Kishi and US imperialism to plan new aggression and war in the Far East, we stand completely on the side of the Japanese people, and we fully support the Japanese people's just struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

    Jin Zhonghua finally pointed out that we love peace, but we are not afraid of war; we will, together with the people of the world, constantly heighten our vigilance, strengthen our unity, and continue to struggle to resolutely smash all the war and aggression conspiracies of US imperialism. The 1960s is the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, and victory will surely belong to the peace-loving people of the world.

    Zhong Min, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, expressed his extreme anger at the provocative behavior of the US-Japanese reactionaries in threatening China's peaceful construction and undermining peace in Asia and the world. He said: We, the people of Shanghai, like all the people of China, have suffered greatly from Japanese militarism. How many people were killed, how many families were destroyed, and how much property was destroyed are still fresh in people's minds. He said: We solemnly warn the US-Japanese reactionaries that in the past, your aggression against old China resulted in a shameful defeat. Now the powerful Chinese people have stood up, the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unparalleled, and the world's peace forces are unprecedentedly strong. If the US-Japanese reactionaries dare to provoke a war, we Chinese people will, together with the people of the world, resolutely and completely eliminate the war instigators and the imperialist system that generates the roots of war from the earth.

    Zhao Zukang, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Liao Shicheng, Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Wei Ru, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Zhou Bingkun, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Shen Cuizhen, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Women's Federation, Fei Fuquan, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Youth Federation, and Ba Jin, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles, also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their full support for the Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement opposing the signing of a military alliance treaty between the United States and Japan, and their full support for the just struggle of the Japanese people.

    美日反动派侵略阴谋必遭可耻失败
    上海集会谴责美日军事同盟条约
    新华社上海24日电　上海市各界人民今天下午庄严集会，严厉谴责和坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，热烈拥护我国外交部1月14日关于反对日美军事同盟条约的严正声明，支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约和争取独立、民主、和平、中立的正义斗争。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会主席金仲华在会上讲了话。他说：日美“共同合作和安全条约”是一个彻头彻尾的侵略性的军事同盟条约。这个条约的签订，标志着日本军国主义在美帝国主义扶持下的复活，并公然参加了美国所主持的侵略性军事集团。这个条约的目的是准备新的侵略战争，其矛头指向中国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和亚洲各国人民，因而严重地威胁着远东和世界的和平。这个条约的签订将把日本人民拖上灾难性的战争道路，它完全违反了日本人民的意志。
    金仲华指出，这个条约的签订，更加揭穿了最近美帝国主义所玩弄的“假和平、真备战”的阴谋把戏。美帝国主义穷凶极恶的侵略面貌，已经更加充分地暴露在全世界人民的面前。
    金仲华说：我们一向是把日本人民和日本的军国主义分子严格区别开的。在粉碎岸信介同美帝国主义在远东策划新的侵略和战争阴谋的斗争中，我们完全站在日本人民这一边，我们全力支持日本人民争取独立、民主、和平与中立的正义斗争。
    金仲华最后指出，我们热爱和平，但是决不害怕战争；我们将和全世界人民一起，不断提高警惕，加强团结，再接再厉进行斗争，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的一切战争侵略阴谋。二十世纪六十年代是东风压倒西风的时代，胜利一定是属于全世界爱好和平的人民的。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会副主席钟民在会上对美日反动派威胁我国和平建设和破坏亚洲和世界和平的挑衅行为表示无比愤怒。他说：我们上海人民和全中国人民一样，曾经受过日本军国主义的惨重祸害。多少人被杀戮，多少家庭被破坏，多少财产被毁灭，现在人们记忆犹新。他说：我们严正地警告美日反动派，过去你们侵略旧中国，最后得到的是可耻的失败。现在强大中国人民已经站起来了，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量无比强大，世界和平力量空前壮大。如果美日反动派胆敢挑起战争，我们中国人民将和全世界人民一起，坚决把战争祸首和产生战争根源的帝国主义制度从地球上彻底消灭干净。
    在会上讲话的还有民革上海市委主任委员赵祖康、民盟上海市委副主任委员廖世承、民建上海市委常务委员魏如、上海市总工会副主席周炳坤、上海市妇联副主任沈粹缜、上海市青联副主席费福泉、上海市文联副主席巴金。他们一致表示完全拥护我国外交部关于反对日美签订军事同盟条约的声明，全力支持日本人民的正义斗争。
