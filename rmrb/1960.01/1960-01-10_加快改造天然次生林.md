    Accelerate the Transformation of Natural Secondary Forests
    By People's Daily Commentator
    Strengthening the management of natural secondary forests is of great significance for solving the shortage of forest resources in our country, rationally distributing forests, and promoting production development in mountainous areas.
    Natural secondary forests are forests that were originally virgin forests or natural forests, which suffered destruction due to indiscriminate logging, burning, and fires during the rule of successive reactionary classes. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, they have been restored through mass afforestation campaigns. It is a type of forest widely distributed and covering a large area in our country. Among the existing forests, except for the virgin forests in remote areas and newly planted artificial forests, most of the forests in areas with convenient transportation and close to agricultural and pastoral areas are natural secondary forests.
    The disadvantages of natural secondary forests are their relatively dispersed distribution and low yield per unit area. However, their advantages are rapid growth and high benefits once artificial cultivation is strengthened. In Wushan County, Gansu Province, due to the strengthening of management of natural secondary forests in recent years, the forest area has greatly increased compared to before liberation, and 66% of the soil erosion area has been controlled, promoting increased grain production. In recent years, grain production has increased three to four times. In 1958, there were more than 100 production brigades where forestry and sideline income accounted for more than 40% of the total income.
    Since natural secondary forest areas are mostly distributed in hilly areas close to villages, they have more advantageous conditions than afforestation on barren mountains in remote areas. Therefore, expanding larger-scale forestry bases on the basis of natural secondary forest areas has the characteristics of low investment, high returns, fast speed, easy success, and good management. Therefore, actively strengthening the management of natural secondary forests, improving the yield and quality of forest trees, and rapidly transforming our country's current slow-growing and low-yielding natural secondary forests into fast-growing and high-yielding forests to meet the needs of our country's high-speed socialist construction is an important task in the current forestry construction.
    Further strengthening the management of natural secondary forests and completely changing the face of natural secondary forests are now under very favorable conditions. After the realization of communization, the masses in forest areas have been highly organized, which facilitates the centralized and unified arrangement of labor to engage in large-scale forestry production activities. Over the past ten years since the founding of the country, not only have grassroots forestry management organizations been generally established in natural secondary forest areas, but a team of forestry workers has been cultivated and strengthened, and some experience in managing natural secondary forests has been accumulated in practice. As long as we make full use of these favorable conditions and positive factors, and further take various management measures for the existing natural secondary forests, we can, in a relatively short period of time, cultivate slow-growing and low-yielding natural secondary forests into fast-growing and high-yielding forests and establish forestry bases.
    The management of natural secondary forests is a relatively complex task. The conditions vary from place to place, and the measures taken cannot be exactly the same. To manage natural secondary forests well, it is necessary to first conduct research and investigation and formulate practical and feasible comprehensive management plans based on the local natural and economic conditions, in the spirit of comprehensive development and comprehensive management. In the plan, it is necessary to consider both the long-term interests of the country and the current needs of the masses; to develop both forestry and agriculture and animal husbandry; to cultivate both timber forests and economic forests and fuel wood forests.
    Strengthening cultivation work is an important measure to improve the yield and quality of forests. The cultivation of natural secondary forests should focus on the cultivation of dense middle-aged and young forests, and conscientiously implement the technical measures of "five cuts and five no cuts": cut dense but not sparse; cut bent but not straight; cut diseased and rotten trees but not healthy trees; cut miscellaneous shrubs but not economic trees; cut sprouted trees but not seedling trees. This is the summary of the experience of the masses in cultivating natural secondary forests over the years. After the implementation of the above measures in the Liziyuan Forest Area of Tianshui County, the growth of the cultivated trees has increased four to five times compared to the uncultivated trees in a short period of two years.
    Actively transforming low-quality forest areas such as sparse forests and shrubs is a decisive measure to change the face of natural secondary forests. At present, the focus should be on the "three transformations" of "turning forests without trees into forests with trees," "turning sparse forests into dense forests," and "turning shrub forests into arbor forests," and gradually carry out the transformation by planting good tree species.
    Fully utilizing the existing forest resources and comprehensively transforming natural secondary forests is an important guideline for forest area management. To achieve full utilization, comprehensive measures must be taken to develop forest product processing industries based on simple and small-scale, combined local and foreign methods, and combine harvesting, cultivation, transformation and other management work to engage in timber processing, wood fiber, forest chemical and agricultural tool production. As a result of the practice of the Tangge Forest Management Station in Wushan County, branches and broken wood are fully utilized, and there is no waste material in the forest area; it has supported industrial and agricultural production and ensured the comprehensive development of the management of natural secondary forests, not only without asking the state for a penny, but also accumulating a large amount of funds for the state.
    In addition, establishing seed collection bases, vigorously developing seedling cultivation, and resolving the contradictions between forestry and animal husbandry and between afforestation and firewood collection are also important measures to ensure the development of natural secondary forest management. Tianshui Prefecture in Gansu Province has achieved outstanding experience in these areas. They fully mobilized the masses to designate fast-growing and precious forest trees in groups and individually as seed trees, and carried out cultivation, fertilization and other cultivation work to establish seed collection bases. According to the principle of not competing with agriculture for land and "forests on the mountains and agriculture in the plains," nurseries were opened in the forests on the slopes, absorbing the experience of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and cultivating seedlings of high quantity and quality. According to the needs of forest area planning and animal husbandry development, grazing forests were designated in open spaces in the forest with abundant grass and water, improved pastures, and established grazing facilities to realize rotational grazing, which resolved the contradiction between forestry and animal husbandry. Near residential areas, the method of middle forest operation (that is, mixed management of timber forests in the upper layer and fuel wood forests in the lower layer on the same forest land) was adopted, which not only cultivated timber but also solved the problem of firewood for the masses, and the contradiction between afforestation and firewood collection was also resolved. These experiences are worth learning from all over the country.
    Strengthening the management of natural secondary forests and completely changing the face of natural secondary forests is the demand of the broad masses in natural secondary forest areas. Party organizations and people's communes in various forest areas should give full play to the wisdom and strength of the broad masses of the people, and adopt the method of small-scale work during busy farming seasons and large-scale work during less busy seasons to conscientiously grasp the work of transforming natural secondary forests.
    Now is a good time for winter afforestation. All natural secondary forest areas should combine the winter firewood collection activities of the masses to organize forces, strengthen guidance, and clean up the low-quality forest areas planned for transformation this year to prepare for the introduction and planting of precious and fast-growing tree species. We believe that as long as we thoroughly oppose right-leaning tendencies, go all out, resolutely rely on the masses, and give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, we will be able to change the face of natural secondary forests more quickly.

    加快改造天然次生林
    本报评论员
    加强对天然次生林的经营管理，对于解决我国森林资源不足、使森林合理分布和促进山区生产发展，有十分重要的意义。
    天然次生林，是原始林或天然林，在历代反动阶级统治时期，曾经遭受滥伐、烧垦、火灾等破坏，解放后在党的领导下，又在群众造林运动中重新恢复起来的一种森林。它是我国分布较广、面积很大的一种森林。在现有森林中，除边远地区的原始林和新造人工林外，凡在交通便利、接近农牧地区的森林，大部都是天然次生林。
    比较分散、单位面积产量低是天然次生林的弱点；但是，一旦加强人工抚育，成长快、效益大又是它的优点。甘肃省武山县由于几年来加强了对天然次生林的经营管理，森林面积比解放前大大增加，66％的水土流失面积已经得到控制，促进了粮食增产。几年来，粮食产量提高了三至四倍。1958年林副业收入占总收入40％以上的生产大队有一百多个。
    由于天然次生林区大都分布在靠近村庄的丘岭地带，因此具有比经营边远地区的荒山造林比较优越的条件。因而在天然次生林区的基础上扩建更大规模的林业基地，就具有投资少、收效大、速度快、易成功、好经营等多方面的特点。因此，积极加强对天然次生林的经营管理，提高林木产量质量，迅速将我国目前慢生低产的天然次生林改变为速生丰产林，以适应我国高速度建设社会主义的需要，这是当前林业建设事业中的一个重要的任务。
    进一步加强对天然次生林的经营管理，彻底改变天然次生林的面貌，目前已具有非常有利的条件。实现公社化以后，林区群众已高度组织起来，便于集中统一安排劳力，从事大规模的林业生产活动。建国十年来，天然次生林区不但已经普遍建立了林业基层经营机构，培养与壮大了林业职工队伍，并在实践中积累了一些经营天然次生林的经验。只要我们充分利用这些有利条件和积极因素，对现有的天然次生林进一步采取各种经营措施，就可以在较短的期间内，将慢生低产的天然次生林培育成为速生丰产林，建立起林业基地。
    天然次生林的经营工作，是一项比较复杂的工作。各地情况不同，采取的措施也不能完全一样。要经营好天然次生林，首先要作好调查研究工作，根据当地的自然、经济情况，本着全面发展、全面经营的精神，制定切实可行的全面经营规划。在规划中，既要考虑到国家长远利益，又要照顾到群众当前的需要；既要发展林业，又要发展农牧业；既要培养用材林，又要培育经济林和薪炭林。
    加强抚育工作，是提高森林产量质量的重要措施。抚育天然次生林，应以抚育茂密的中幼林为中心，并切实贯彻砍稠不砍稀；砍弯不砍直；砍病腐木不砍健壮木；砍杂灌木不砍经济木；砍萌芽木不砍实生木的“五砍五不砍”技术措施。这是各地群众多年来抚育天然次生林的经验总结。天水县李子园林区贯彻了上述措施，在短短的二年时间内，已抚育过的林木，比未抚育过的林木生长量提高四至五倍。
    积极对疏林灌木等低劣林区进行改造，是改变天然次生林面貌具有决定意义的措施。当前应以“无林改有林”，“疏林改密林”，“灌木林改乔木林”的三改为主，采取栽植良好树种的办法，逐步进行改造。
    充分利用现有林区资源，全面改造天然次生林，是林区经营工作的一个重要方针。要作到充分利用，必须采取综合措施，发展以简易、小型为主，土洋结合的林产品加工工业，结合采伐、抚育、改造等经营工作，搞木材加工、木材纤维、林产化学和农具生产。武山县滩歌森林经营所这样作的结果，枝桠碎木都得到充分利用，作到了林区无废材；既支援了工农业生产，又保证了天然次生林经营工作的全面开展，不仅没有向国家要一文钱，反而为国家积累了大量资金。
    此外，建立采种基地，大搞育苗，解决林牧矛盾和育林与砍柴矛盾，也是保证天然次生林经营工作开展的重要措施。甘肃省天水专区在这些方面取得了突出的经验。他们充分发动群众把成片成群和单株的速生珍贵的林木划为母树林，并进行了抚育、施肥等培育工作，建立了采种基地。根据不与农业争地和“林上山，农下川”的原则，在山坡林间开辟了苗圃，吸取农业八字宪法的经验，培育了量多质好的苗木。根据林区规划和畜牧业发展的需要，在林中空地草多水足的地方划定了放牧林，改良牧草，建立放牧设施，实现轮牧，解决了林牧之间的矛盾。在居民点附近采取了中林作业（即在同一林地上，上层是用材林，下层是薪炭林的混合经营）的办法，既培育了用材，又解决了群众烧柴，育林和砍柴之间的矛盾也得到了解决。这些经验都值得各地学习。
    加强天然次生林的经营管理，彻底改变天然次生林面貌，是天然次生林区广大群众的要求，各林区党组织和人民公社应当充分发挥广大人民群众的智慧和力量，采取农忙小搞、小忙大搞的办法，把改造天然次生林的工作认真地抓起来。
    现在正是冬季造林的好时光。各天然次生林区应当结合群众冬季打柴活动很好地组织力量，加强指导，对今年计划改造的低劣林区，进行清理，为引栽珍贵速生树种作好准备。我们相信，只要我们反透右倾，鼓足干劲，坚决依靠群众，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，一定能够更快地改变天然次生林的面貌。
