Xinhua News Agency, 18th – German Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Wang Guozhang, held a grand banquet tonight for the German Democratic Republic government delegation's visit to China.

Vice Premier Heinrich Rau and Vice Premier Li Xiannian spoke at the banquet successively (full text on page four). They unanimously emphasized that the Chinese and German governments and peoples warmly welcome and actively support the Soviet Supreme Soviet's adoption of another reduction of 1.2 million armed forces as a peaceful measure, and resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialism's evil activities of reviving West German and Japanese militarism and preparing for new wars. They also pointed out that the Sino-German Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and the Sino-German government agreement on the exchange of goods from 1960 to 1962, signed today, mark a further development of the friendly cooperative relations between China and Germany.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended tonight's banquet. He raised his glass at the banquet to toast the ever-growing unbreakable friendship between China and the German Democratic Republic.

Vice Premier Heinrich Rau's wife, members of the German Democratic Republic government delegation: Paul Verner, alternate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Otto Winzer, member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and their wives, as well as all the distinguished guests of the government delegation and German experts helping with China's construction, attended the banquet.

Also attending the banquet were Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long, Chen Yi, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Bao Erhan, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Ji Pengfei, and Zeng Yongquan, among others.

Vice Premier Heinrich Rau spoke first at the banquet. He said that contrary to the general trend of easing international tensions, West Germany is currently promoting revanchism, implementing atomic armament, and inciting racial hatred. This racial hatred serves the preparation and implementation of the German imperialists' aggressive plans.

He said that in the struggle to safeguard European peace, the German Democratic Republic has received effective support from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all other socialist countries. The Soviet Union's bold and great proposal for complete and thorough disarmament has received the full support of the government and people of the German Democratic Republic. The Soviet government's action of continuing to reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million proves that its peaceful policy serves the general easing of international tensions and world peace.

Vice Premier Rau said that the military treaty that the United States and the reactionary Nobusuke Kishi government are about to conclude under the pretext of revising the Security Treaty will enable Japanese militarists to rearm freely. Its spearhead is aimed at the security of the people of Asian and Far Eastern countries. The German Democratic Republic most strongly condemns this measure, which is aimed at the interests of the People's Republic of China, other socialist countries, and the people of all countries, including the Japanese people. It fully supports the resolute attitude taken by the Chinese government against this action that endangers peace.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian then spoke at the banquet. He said: Recently, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed the law on another reduction of 1.2 million armed forces and the letter of appeal to the parliaments and governments of all countries. This action by the Soviet Union powerfully demonstrates the sincere desire of the Soviet government and people to strive for peace and their unparalleled confidence in their own strength. The Chinese government and people warmly welcome and actively support this peaceful measure of the Soviet Union, and believe that it will have a significant impact on further easing international tensions.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian then pointed out: However, the U.S. ruling clique, under the guise of "peace," has not abandoned its policies of war and aggression in the slightest. He emphasized that in Europe, the United States is still insisting on pursuing a policy of dividing Germany and reviving West German militarism, making West Germany the most aggressive force and the main hotbed of war in Europe; in Asia, the United States is stepping up military collusion with Japan and is preparing to sign a military alliance treaty with the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government on the 19th of this month. The establishment of the U.S.-Japan military alliance is a sign of the revival of Japanese militarism and Japan's open participation in the U.S. aggressive military bloc, and it is also an extremely serious step by the United States to encircle China and the Soviet Union, threaten Asian countries, and intensify tensions in the Far East. These actions of the United States thoroughly expose its tactic of "fake peace, real war preparations," and the peace forces of the world must make persistent efforts to defeat the new aggression and expansion activities of the United States.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian concluded by saying: The Chinese government and people resolutely oppose the U.S. revival of West German and Japanese militarism and the evil activities of preparing for new wars. The Chinese government and people resolutely support the reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic for concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys and resolving the West Berlin issue, and believe that the German Democratic Republic has every right to send representatives to participate in the resolution of issues related to Germany. The Chinese people are convinced that the German people's struggle for national reunification and defense of European security will surely achieve final victory.

After the speeches by the two vice premiers, the bands played the national anthems of China and Germany respectively. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by all Chinese and foreign guests.

During the banquet, the guests repeatedly toasted the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Germany, the increasing strength and great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and world peace.

Otto Winzer, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, also delivered a speech at the banquet. At the end of the banquet, Wang Guozhang expressed his gratitude to all the guests attending the banquet and proposed that everyone toast the friendship between the Chinese and German peoples and world peace.

Also attending the banquet were heads of various departments of state organs, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, heads of Beijing Municipality, and people from all walks of life in the capital. Envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    劳副总理和李先念副总理在德大使宴会上表示
    中德支持苏联裁军和平措施
    坚决反对美国复活西德、日本军国主义和准备新战争
    据新华社18日讯　德意志民主共和国驻中国大使汪戴尔，今晚为德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问中国举行盛大宴会。
    海因里希·劳副总理和李先念副总理先后在宴会上讲了话（全文见第四版）。他们一致强调指出，中德两国政府和两国人民热烈欢迎和积极支持苏联最高苏维埃会议通过的再一次裁减一百二十万武装部队这一和平措施，坚决反对美帝国主义复活西德和日本军国主义和准备新战争的罪恶活动。他们还指出，今天签订的中德通商航海条约和中德两国政府关于1960年到1962年交换货物协定，标志着中德两国友好合作关系的进一步发展。
    周恩来总理出席了今晚的宴会。他在宴会上举杯致词，祝贺中国和德意志民主共和国牢不可破的友谊日益发展。
    海因里希·劳副总理的夫人，德意志民主共和国政府代表团的团员：德国统一社会党中央政治局候补委员保罗·维尔纳，德国统一社会党中央委员、外交部第一副部长奥托·文策尔和他们的夫人，以及政府代表团的全体贵宾、帮助中国建设的德国专家，都出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的有国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅、习仲勋，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长章汉夫、姬鹏飞、曾涌泉等。
    海因里希·劳副总理在宴会上首先讲话。他说，和国际局势走向缓和的总的趋势相反，西德目前却在宣传复仇主义、实行原子武装和煽动种族仇视。这种种族仇视是为德国帝国主义准备和实现他们的侵略计划服务的。
    他说，在保障欧洲和平的斗争中，德意志民主共和国得到了苏联、中华人民共和国和所有其他社会主义国家的有效的支持。苏联关于全面彻底裁军的大胆而伟大的建议，得到了德意志民主共和国政府和人民的全力支持。苏联政府以继续裁减一百二十万军队的行动证明，它的和平政策是为国际局势的普遍缓和和世界和平服务的。
    劳副总理说，美国和反动的岸信介政府以修改安全条约为名即将缔结的军事条约，将使日本军国主义者得以自由地重整军备。它的矛头针对着亚洲和远东各国人民的安全。德意志民主共和国最强烈地谴责这一矛头针对中华人民共和国、其他社会主义国家和各国人民利益，包括日本人民利益在内的措施。它完全支持中华人民共和国政府针对这种危害和平的行动所采取的坚决态度。
    李先念副总理接着在宴会上讲话。他说：最近，苏联最高苏维埃会议通过了再一次裁减一百二十万武装部队的法律和致世界各国议会和政府的呼吁书。苏联的这一行动，有力地证明了苏联政府和人民对于争取和平的真诚愿望和对于自己力量的无比信心。中国政府和人民热烈欢迎和积极支持苏联的这一和平措施，并且相信这必将对进一步缓和国际紧张局势发生重大的影响。
    李先念副总理接着指出：但是，美国统治集团在“和平”的伪装下，丝毫也没有放弃它的战争和侵略政策。他强调说，在欧洲，美国仍在坚持推行分裂德国和复活西德军国主义的政策；使西德成为欧洲最富于侵略性的势力和主要的战争温床；在亚洲，美国正在加紧同日本进行军事勾结，准备在本月19日同日本岸信介政府签订一项军事同盟条约。美日军事同盟的成立，是日本军国主义复活和日本公然参加美国的侵略性军事集团的标志，同时也是美国包围中苏、威胁亚洲各国和加剧远东紧张局势的一个极其严重的步骤。美国的这些行动彻底暴露了它“假和平，真备战”的手法，全世界的和平力量必须为击败美国新的侵略和扩张活动进行坚持不懈的努力。
    李先念副总理最后说：中国政府和人民坚决反对美国复活西德和日本军国主义和准备新战争的罪恶活动。中国政府和人民坚决支持苏联和德意志民主共和国所提出的同两个德国缔结和约和解决西柏林问题的合理建议，并且认为，在解决有关德国问题时，德意志民主共和国完全有权派代表参加。中国人民确信，德国人民争取祖国统一和保卫欧洲安全的斗争一定会取得最后的胜利。
    在两国副总理讲话后，乐队分别奏了中、德两国国歌。他们的讲话受到全体中外人士的热烈欢迎。
    席间，宾主不断为中德两国人民的兄弟友谊，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的日益强大和伟大团结，为世界和平而干杯。
    德意志民主共和国外交部第一副部长奥托·文策尔也在宴会上致词。宴会结束时，汪戴尔对出席宴会的全体来宾表示感谢，并提议大家为中德两国人民的友谊和世界和平干杯。
    出席宴会的，还有国家机关各部门的负责人，中国人民解放军的高级将领，北京市的负责人，首都各界人士。各国驻中国的使节和外交官员，也应邀出席了宴会。
