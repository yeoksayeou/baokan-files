Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from New York: The American "Workers' Weekly" published an article by Mason on the 17th, pointing out that Eisenhower, in his recently proposed State of the Union address, on the one hand "empty rhetoric of peace," while on the other hand "proposed to continue to increase armaments of various types with appropriations no less than in the past few years."

Mason wrote in commenting on Eisenhower's State of the Union address that this address clearly shows that the Republican Party intends to campaign again with the slogan of "peace and prosperity." However, the address made no mention of the first step towards peace—namely, the East-West summit meeting scheduled for May in Paris. The article said that many people had hoped that the US president would hint in his address at the US's proposals and prospects for the meeting.

The article pointed out that after Eisenhower spoke about the possibility of peaceful negotiations with the Soviet Union, he then attacked the Soviet Union as unreliable, rather than seeking a common basis for resolving differences.

The article said that Eisenhower's attitude towards the comprehensive and complete disarmament proposals put forward by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev to the United Nations General Assembly was negative. Eisenhower did not welcome these proposals, but demanded that the Soviet Union provide guarantees and conduct supervision even before the first stage of negotiations. He himself did not put forward any specific disarmament proposals.

The article also said that in domestic affairs, the US president's proposals were all against the interests of the majority of the people and could only help Wall Street monopolists. He proposed to continue to increase armaments of various types with appropriations no less than in the past few years.

The article said that if the policy in the address is pursued, it can be expected that legislation will be passed to harm trade unions, which will make the unions' situation even worse than under the infamous Griffin-Landrum and Taft-Hartley laws. The article also pointed out that Eisenhower's address adopted a policy of doing nothing in education, civil rights, and economic development.

    美“工人周报”评艾森豪威尔国情咨文
    美国空喊和平继续扩军
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：美国“工人周报”17日刊载梅森的一篇文章指出，艾森豪威尔在他最近提出的国情咨文中，一方面“空喊和平”，同时却又“提议以不低于过去几年的拨款继续增加各种型式的军备”。
    梅森在评论艾森豪威尔的国情咨文时写道，这篇咨文清楚地表明了，共和党打算再次以“和平和繁荣”的口号进行竞选。但是，咨文中丝毫没有提到和平方面的第一步——即定于5月在巴黎举行的东西方最高级会议。文章说，许多人曾经希望美国总统在咨文中对美国对这次会议的建议和前景作出暗示。
    文章指出，艾森豪威尔在谈到同苏联和平谈判的可能性以后，接着却又攻击苏联不可靠，而不是寻求解决分歧的共同基础。
    文章说，对于苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫向联合国大会提出的全面和彻底裁军的建议，艾森豪威尔的态度是否定的。艾森豪威尔没有欢迎这些建议，却要求苏联甚至在谈判的第一阶段以前就提供保证和进行监督。他自己没有提出任何具体裁军建议。
    文章还说，在国内事务上，美国总统的建议全是反对大多数人民的利益，并且只能帮助华尔街垄断资本家。他提议以不低于过去几年的拨款继续增加各种型式的军备。
    文章说，如果奉行咨文中的方针，可以预料，将会通过损害工会的立法，这种立法将使工会的遭遇比在不名誉的格里芬—兰德勒姆和塔夫脱—哈特莱法下甚至更坏。文章还指出，艾森豪威尔的咨文在教育、公民权利和发展经济方面采取了什么也不做的政策。
