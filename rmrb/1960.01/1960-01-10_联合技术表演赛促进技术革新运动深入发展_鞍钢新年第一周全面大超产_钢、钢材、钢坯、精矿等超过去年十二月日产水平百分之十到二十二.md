    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 9th. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company has reaped abundant fruits from its first joint technical performance competition week this year. From January 1st to 7th, major products such as steel, iron, steel products, steel billets, concentrate, and coke all overfulfilled their plans, and the average daily production level greatly exceeded the average daily production level of December last year, with steel, steel products, steel billets, and concentrate exceeding it by 10% to 22% respectively.
    The joint technical performance competition is a major creation of the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel. It was developed on the basis of the technical performance competition in the Third Steelmaking Plant. The shift from dispersed to joint technical performance competitions is more suitable for the characteristics of joint enterprises. It makes the goals and actions of the broad masses of workers consistent, thus more effectively exerting the power of the technical performance competition. In this joint technical performance competition week movement, which began on New Year's Day, more than 113,000 workers participated in performances, totaling more than 870,000 person-times; more than 80% of the leading cadres of various factories and mines also participated in the performances; the scope covered all major factories and mines and auxiliary departments. In the upsurge of the competition, workers in various factories and mines broke through more than 3,800 key production points, created new records more than 12,000 times, and produced more than 18,000 advanced individuals and more than 2,400 advanced collectives. Many workers reached the level of advanced producers through the performance competition.
    This joint technical performance competition further promoted the in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In seven days, the technical innovations and advanced experiences that emerged from various factories and mines totaled more than 4,740 items, of which 748 sets of advanced experiences had been matched into complete sets. For example, the workers of various steelmaking plants widely used the advanced experiences of rapid steelmaking and maintaining the furnace body, innovated operating methods, shortened the steelmaking time, and greatly improved the operating rate. The Second Steelmaking Plant, by increasing the operating rate, increased steel production by more than 5,000 tons over the plan in seven days. The workers of the ironmaking plant adopted innovative measures and improved the operating rate, so that the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace increased from 1.671 in December last year to 1.711, of which the utilization coefficient of the national red banner blast furnace increased from 2.383 in December last year to 2.462, and the qualified rate of pig iron in the whole plant increased from 92.4% in December last year to 96.5%. Through this joint technical performance competition, the cooperation among various factories and mines has become closer.
    At present, the broad masses of workers of Anshan Iron and Steel are summarizing the experience of the first joint technical performance competition week, and are determined to create greater achievements in the second joint technical performance competition week.

    鞍钢新年第一周全面大超产
    钢、钢材、钢坯、精矿等超过去年十二月日产水平百分之十到二十二
    新华社鞍山9日电　鞍山钢铁公司今年开展第一个联合技术表演竞赛周，果实累累。1日至7日，钢、铁、钢材、钢坯、精矿、焦炭等主要产品都超额完成了计划，平均日产水平都大大超过了去年12月份的平均日产水平，其中钢、钢材、钢坯、精矿等分别超过10％到22％。
    联合技术表演竞赛是鞍钢职工的一项重大创造，它是在第三炼钢厂的技术表演竞赛的基础上发展起来的。技术表演竞赛由分散到联合，更适合于联合企业的特点，它使广大职工的目标一致、行动一致，从而更有效地发挥了技术表演竞赛的威力。从元旦起开展的这个联合技术表演竞赛周运动，七天中共有十一万三千多名工人参加表演，共表演了八十七万多人次；各厂矿80％以上的领导干部也参加了表演；范围遍及各主要厂矿和辅助部门。在竞赛热潮里，各厂矿职工共突破生产关键三千八百多个，创造新纪录一万二千多次，出现先进人物一万八千多名，先进集体二千四百多个，有许多工人经过表演赛达到了先进生产者的水平。
    这次联合技术表演赛，进一步促进了技术革新和技术革命运动的深入发展。七天里，各厂矿涌现的技术革新和先进经验共达四千七百四十多项，其中已经配成套的先进经验有七百四十八套。如各炼钢厂职工广泛运用快速炼钢和维护炉体的先进经验，革新操作方法，缩短了炼钢时间，大大提高了作业率，第二炼钢厂因提高作业率，七天中就比计划增产五千多吨钢。炼铁厂职工采取革新措施和提高了作业率，使高炉利用系数由去年12月的一点六七一提高到一点七一一，其中全国红旗高炉利用系数由去年12月的二点三八三提高到二点四六二，全厂生铁合格率由去年12月的92．4％提高到96．5％。通过这次联合技术表演竞赛，各厂矿互相协作得更加密切了。
    目前，鞍钢广大职工正在总结第一个联合技术表演竞赛周的经验，决心在第二个联合技术表演竞赛周里创造更大的成就。
