Residents' Collective Organization: A Strong Assistant to the Government
A Street Committee in Bucharest Enthusiastic About Public Affairs

    Dinca Stefan Street is one of the more than six thousand streets in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, and is home to two hundred and ten working-class families. The appearance of this street and the courtyards of each household are very clean and beautiful. The residents can live in harmony and care about the collective. These are inseparable from the work of the street committee.
    The Dinca Stefan Street Committee was elected by the residents of this street a year ago. The street committee has done a lot of work in the past year, and the things it cares about are diverse.
    The most meaningful work of the street committee is to absorb citizens to participate in the construction of the street's sewer system. Under the call of the street committee, residents participated in excavation, transportation of soil, and other work, laboring for more than five thousand hours, thereby shortening the construction period and reducing construction costs.
    The reading group established by the street committee in cooperation with the district women's committee has carried out extensive activities. Participants in the reading group, especially housewives, thus have the opportunity to understand the domestic and international political situation. The street committee mobilizes residents to complete certain tasks of a universal nature stipulated by the relevant departments of the People's Congress. The street committee, in cooperation with the district Red Cross Committee, implements plans to prevent diseases in order to continuously improve the health level of residents. All residents of this street underwent lung fluoroscopy, and all children received polio vaccinations, and so on.
    The street committee maintains close contact with the educators of Elementary School No. 117, and cares about children's learning and after-school activities. The street committee organizes special performances for children and organizes housewives to make some supplies for the school.
    The street committee often conducts collectivist education for residents through some specific examples. For example, the committee once opposed the idea that individual residents were unwilling to participate in public management work and enjoy the benefits. The street committee, which is often among the people, has not neglected other public interests, especially neighborly relations. Even small things like quarrels between two neighbors are not let go. Once, two housewives had a dispute. After the committee's mediation, they both felt ashamed, apologized to each other, and reconciled. There are currently more than two thousand street committees like the Dinca Stefan Street Committee in Bucharest. Whether in economic, cultural, or health work, they are strong assistants to the state's local organs of power. (Fang Luo)

    居民的集体组织　政府的有力助手
    热心公务的布加勒斯特一个街道委员会
    丁卡·斯得凡街是罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特六千多条街道之一，这里居住的有二百一十户工人家庭。这条街的外貌、家家户户的院落非常整洁美观。居民能够和睦相处，关心集体。这些都是同街道委员会的工作分不开的。
    丁卡·斯得凡街的街道委员会是在一年前由这条街的居民选举产生的。这个街道委员会一年来作了很多工作，它所关心的事是多种多样的。
    街道委员会最有意义的工作是吸收市民参加建筑街道下水道系统的工作。居民在街道委员会的号召下，参加了挖土、运土等工作，劳动了五千多小时，从而缩短了施工的期限，并降低了建筑成本。
    街道委员会在同区妇女委员会的合作下建立起来的阅读小组，进行了广泛的活动。阅读小组的参加者，特别是家庭妇女，因而有机会了解国内外的政治形势。街道委员会动员居民来完成由人民会议有关部门规定的某些具有普遍性质的任务。街道委员会在同区红十字会委员会合作下，实现为不断提高居民健康水平而采取预防疾病的计划。所有这条街道的居民都进行了肺部透视，所有儿童都接受了预防小儿麻痹症的注射等等。
    街道委员会同第117小学的教育人员保持着密切的联系，关心儿童的学习和课余活动的方式。街道委员会为儿童组织专门的演出，组织家庭妇女们为学校制造一些用品。
    街道委员会经常通过一些具体事例对居民展开集体主义的教育。例如，委员会曾经和广大居民一起反对个别居民不愿参加公共管理工作、坐享现成的思想。经常处身于人民群众之中的街道委员会也没有疏忽其他的公共利益，特别是邻居的关系。甚至于像两个邻居吵架这样的小事情也不肯放松。有一次有两家主妇发生了纠纷，经过委员会的调解，她们都感到惭愧，并且相互道歉，重归于好。像丁卡·斯得凡街这样的街道委员会，目前在布加勒斯特一共有二千多个。它们不论在经济、文化、卫生等工作方面，都是国家地方权力机关的有力助手。　（方罗）
