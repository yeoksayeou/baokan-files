Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 25th: (Reporters Zhang Jiachi, He Changhua) In the first month of 1960, Shanghai's industrial production advanced at an extraordinary pace. Millions of industrial workers demonstrated greater ambition and took another step forward in improving labor productivity and scaling technical peaks.

Based on the situation in the first twenty-odd days of the year, three distinct characteristics have emerged in the continued leap forward in Shanghai's industrial production this year. First, the conventional "slack at the beginning of the year" has been completely broken, and production has continued to rise. A large number of factories are completing and exceeding their production plans every day, achieving daily and comprehensive success. From the 1st to the 20th, the city's average daily industrial output value increased by 7% compared to the level in December last year. The output of products has also increased significantly at the beginning of the year. The output of twenty-six major products, such as steel, steel products, power machinery, and sewing machines, in twenty days exceeded the total output of January last year. The balance of production in various industries has significantly improved. In the past, the electromechanical industry would not start assembling machines until after the 10th, but this year, large precision products such as mining machinery, power station boilers, and precision grinders were produced right from the start. This continuous and balanced production situation is bound to win the initiative for a sustained leap forward throughout the year.

Marching towards high-grade and precision, striving to produce first-class products for the country, is the second distinct characteristic of the continued leap forward in Shanghai's industrial situation at the beginning of the year. Various industries formulated new plans for the development of high-grade and precision products at the end of last year, making full use of the technical conditions of Shanghai's old industrial base to produce urgently needed high-grade and precision products and niche products for the country, filling gaps in production technology. As soon as work began in the new year, various industries immediately took action, trial-producing and producing new products on a large scale. Steel workers put forward a new goal of "upgrading step by step." Since the beginning of the year, they have already refined seamless steel pipe steel, heavy rail steel, and transformer silicon steel from converters, which used to be smelted by open-hearth furnaces. Open-hearth furnaces and electric furnaces have also refined new high-grade alloy steel grades. The electrical machinery industry has put more than 350 new products into production at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, of which 33 are high-grade and precision products. The textile industry put more than 100 new colors and varieties into production in the first four days of this year, and successfully trial-produced 113 new colors and varieties. Departments such as machinery, chemical industry, and light industry have also successfully trial-produced or put into production a large number of new products since the beginning of the year. The emergence of such a large number of new products at the beginning of the year is a new phenomenon that has never happened before.

The third distinct characteristic is that from the beginning of the year, all industries have been vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, actively carrying out technical transformation and equipment renewal, so that Shanghai's industrial production can further achieve modernization. The more than 20 technical innovation exhibitions in various districts of the city, which opened on New Year's Day, have become the center for promoting the development of the city's technical innovation movement. The exhibitions are held in the form of mass movements, holding professional exchanges, attacking key problems, opening training classes, and carrying out communist cooperation. In more than 20 days, they have attracted hundreds of thousands of workers to participate. The number of innovation proposals put forward by the city's workers is increasing, the quality is getting higher and higher, and the realization is getting faster and faster. The arrival of an unprecedented upsurge of technical innovation has prompted the technical appearance of large and small factories to change with each passing day, and a trend of comprehensive technical transformation of entire enterprises and entire industries has begun to emerge. For example, after the Pioneer Glove Factory changed all manual flat knitting machines to electric ones in November last year, the city's glove industry immediately promoted it universally. Up to now, more than 90% of the 1,640 manual flat knitting machines in this industry have been converted to electric ones, the technical appearance has been completely changed, and labor productivity has been greatly improved.

The excellent situation on Shanghai's industrial front at the beginning of this year has been demonstrated on the basis of two consecutive years of great leaps forward. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of workers have been more consciously implementing the Party's general line, and their desire to change the "poor and blank" situation has become more and more urgent. In the struggle to climb technical peaks and strive for first-class products, they are not only daring, but also working very hard and very fast. Wang Linhe, a 29-year-old young worker at the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, only has a junior high school education, but he has the ambition to "have what others have, and create what others don't have." After 371 experiments, he conquered various difficulties and finally successfully trial-produced a high-voltage bridge, and was named one of the "Red Banner Youth Assault Team for the Opening Red in 1960" by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League.

Communist cooperation among the masses of workers has also seen new developments. At the technical innovation exhibitions in various districts, many workers have taken the initiative to help others overcome key production problems. As long as someone raises difficulties and key issues, they will "respond to every call" and "deliver treasures to the door." This is an extremely important factor in the unprecedented development of the technical innovation movement at the beginning of the year.

At present, many factories in the city, such as Shanghai Balance Instrument Factory and Shanghai Bicycle No. 2 Factory, have completed their January production plans ahead of schedule. The broad masses of workers are making various preparations to strive for greater victories after the Spring Festival.

### 不断用新的生产技术创造更高的劳动生产率  上海技术革新运动飞速发展

    不断用新的生产技术创造更高的劳动生产率
    上海技术革新运动飞速发展
    百万职工顽强攀登技术高峰，整个行业积极进行全面技术改造
    新年以来生产水平持续上升，大批新产品已试制成功投入生产
    新华社上海25日电　记者张家炽、贺昌华报道：1960年的第一个月，上海工业生产跃进的步伐不同寻常。百万产业工人表现出更大的雄心壮志，在提高劳动生产率和攀登技术高峰上又前进了一步。
    从年初二十几天的情况来看，今年上海工业生产继续跃进的形势出现了三个鲜明的特点。第一，彻底打破了“年初松”的常规，生产持续上升。大批工厂天天完成和超额完成生产计划，做到日日红、全面红。1到20日，全市工业平均日产值比去年12月份水平提高7％。产品产量年初又有显著增长，钢、钢材、动力机械、缝纫机等二十六种主要产品二十天的产量，就超过了去年1月份全月。各行各业生产的均衡性显著提高，机电工业以往总要到10日以后才开始装配机器，而今年一开门就生产了矿山机械、电站锅炉、精密磨床等大型精密产品。这种持续均衡地生产情况，势必为今年全年的持续跃进争得主动权。
    向高级、精密方向进军，争取为国家生产第一流产品，是年初上海工业继续跃进形势的第二个鲜明特点。各行各业在去年年底就做出了发展高级精密产品的新规划，充分利用上海老工业基地的技术条件，为国家生产迫切需要的高级精密产品和缺门产品，填补生产技术上的空白。新年一开工，各行各业立即行动起来，大批试制和生产新产品。钢铁工人提出了“步步升级”的新的奋斗目标。年初以来，他们已经从转炉中炼出了过去要由平炉冶炼的无缝钢管钢、重轨钢、变压器用矽钢等，平炉和电炉也炼出了新的高级合金钢种。电机工业去年年底、今年年初投入生产的新产品已有三百五十多种，其中有三十三种是高级、精密产品。纺织工业今年头四天就有一百多种新花色品种投入生产，并试制成功新花色品种一百一十三种。机械、化工、轻工业等部门，年初以来也都有大批新产品试制成功或投入生产。年初就有如此大量的新产品涌现，是过去从来没有过的新气象。
    第三个鲜明的特点是：从年初开始，各行各业就大搞技术革新和技术革命，积极进行技术改造和设备更新，使上海工业生产进一步实现现代化。从元旦开幕的全市各区二十多个技术革新展览会，已成为推动全市职工群众技术革新运动发展的中心。展览会以大搞群众运动的方式，举办专业交流、围攻关键、开训练班、大搞共产主义协作等各种活动，二十多天中就吸引了几十万职工参加。全市职工提出的革新建议数量愈来愈多，质量愈来愈高，实现愈来愈快。空前规模的技术革新高潮的到来，促使大小工厂的技术面貌日新月异，并且开始出现了整个企业、整个行业全面技术改造的潮流。例如，先锋手套厂去年11月把全部手摇横机改为电动以后，全市手套行业立即普遍推广。到目前为止，这个行业一千六百四十台手摇横机已有90％以上改为电动，技术面貌完全改变，劳动生产率大大提高。
    今年年初上海工业战线上的大好形势，是在两年来连续大跃进的基础上展现出来的，特别是党的八届八中全会以后，广大职工群众贯彻执行党的总路线更加自觉，要求改变“一穷二白”面貌的心情愈来愈迫切。他们在攀登技术高峰，争取产品第一流的斗争中，不仅敢干，而且干得非常顽强，干得很快。沪光科学仪器厂二十九岁的青年工人王林鹤，只有初中文化程度，但他却有“人家有的，我们要有；人家没有的，我们来创造”的志气，实验了三百七十一次，征服了各种困难，终于试制成功了高压电桥，被共青团上海市委命名为“1960年开门红红旗青年突击手”之一。
    职工群众中共产主义大协作也有了新的发展。在各区技术革新展览会上，许多工人主动要求帮助别人攻克生产关键。只要有人提出困难和关键问题，便“一呼百应”，“送宝上门”。这是年初技术革新运动空前发展的一个极为重要的因素。
    目前，全市已经有上海天平仪器厂、上海自行车二厂等许多工厂提前完成了1月份的生产计划。广大职工正在进行各种准备，争取在春节以后取得更大胜利。
