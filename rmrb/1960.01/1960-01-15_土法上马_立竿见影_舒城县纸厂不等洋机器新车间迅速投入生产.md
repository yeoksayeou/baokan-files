Using Indigenous Methods Achieves Quick Results

Shucheng County Paper Mill Rapidly Puts New Workshop into Production Without Waiting for Foreign Machines

(Reported by this newspaper) The Shucheng County Machine-Made Paper Mill in Anhui Province changed its practice of waiting for foreign machines. Adhering to the spirit of "using foreign methods where possible, and indigenous methods where foreign methods are not," they first adopted indigenous methods, enabling a paper-making workshop with a daily output of one ton to quickly commence production.

This factory was originally designed as a medium-sized paper mill, prepared to equip itself with a complete set of equipment such as paper-making machines, pulping machines, and generators, and implement foreign methods of production. However, the factory buildings were completed, but some machines were still lacking. At that time, the workers put forward three proposals: some advocated continuing to wait; others advocated "closing down"; and the third group advocated first adopting indigenous methods and gradually transitioning to foreign methods of production. In order to unify understanding and find practical solutions, the paper mill's Party branch mobilized the workers to launch a large-scale debate around the topics of "Should we wait for machines and equipment?", "Should we proceed or shut down?", and "Under existing conditions, what methods should we use to proceed?". Many workers, based on the factory's current situation, proposed: "Foreign machines are good, but they are not available immediately; they are like distant water that cannot quench immediate thirst. If we want to be fast, we can only start with indigenous methods." After discussion, all the factory workers unanimously realized that under the specific circumstances at that time, indigenous methods should be adopted first, and gradually transitioned to foreign methods of production. This way, it could be done both quickly and economically.

After unifying their thinking, all the factory workers immediately took action. They invited engineers from Anhui Paper Mill to draw up blueprints, invited four carpenters from the tool factory, and coordinated with sixteen technicians from the factory who had studied in Beijing to form a technical research group, working day and night to manufacture paper-making machines. After more than thirty failures, they finally succeeded in trial production, with 90% wood and 10% iron, costing only 1,000 yuan.

The workers also launched a technical innovation campaign. The number of people in the entire factory has been reduced from 202 to 49, and the surplus people have supported fraternal factories and agricultural production. Now, the paper-making workshop of this factory has fully implemented indigenous mechanized production, with a daily output of about one ton of single-sided glossy paper, with good quality, uniform thickness.

### 土法上马　立竿见影  舒城县纸厂不等洋机器新车间迅速投入生产

    土法上马　立竿见影
    舒城县纸厂不等洋机器新车间迅速投入生产
    本报讯　安徽舒城县机制纸厂，改变了坐等洋机器的作法，本着能洋则洋，不能洋则土的精神，土法先上马，使一个日产一吨的造纸车间迅速投入生产。
    这个厂原是按中型造纸厂设计的，准备装备造纸机、打浆机、发电机等整套设备，实行洋法生产。但是厂房建成了，还缺一些机器。当时职工提出了三种主张：一种人主张继续等待；另一种人主张“收摊子”；第三种人主张土法先上马，逐步向洋法生产过渡。为了统一认识，找出切实可行的办法，纸厂党支部便发动职工，围绕“应不应该坐等机器和设备”、“是上马还是下马”、“在现有条件下用什么方法上马”等题目展开大辩论。许多职工根据工厂当时的情况提出：“洋机器好是好，但是一时来不了，正是远水不解近渴。要想快，只有先用土法子干起来。”经过讨论，全厂职工一致认识到，在当时具体情况下应该土法先上马，逐步向洋法生产过渡。这样可以作到又快又省。
    统一思想认识以后，全厂职工立即行动起来。他们请安徽造纸厂工程师绘了图纸，从工具厂请了四名木工，配合本厂在北京学习过的十六名技工，成立了技术研究小组，星夜赶制造纸机。经过三十多次失败，终于试制成功，九成木头一成铁，成本只花一千元。
    职工们还开展了技术革新运动。全厂人员已由二百零二人减少到四十九人，多余下来的人支援了兄弟厂和农业生产。现在，这个厂的造纸车间，已全部实行土机械化生产，日产单面光连纸一吨左右，质量良好，厚薄均匀。
