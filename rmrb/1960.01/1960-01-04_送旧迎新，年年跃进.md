    Seeing Off the Old and Welcoming the New, Progressing Every Year
    If striving for the top is the characteristic of the people's spirit in our era, then progressing every year is the norm for the development of the national economy in our socialist country.
    However, there is also a more popular argument: the larger the base of the national economy, the smaller the margin of progress. The implication is that as China's economy develops, continuous progress will become impossible. This is a pessimistic argument, a manifestation of a lack of confidence in the sustained progress of China's national economy. These people only see that the larger the base of the national economy, the more products need to be increased in absolute terms to maintain a certain rate of production development. They fail to see that the larger the base, the more developed industrial and agricultural production, and the more expanded the material base, the more favorable conditions and potential forces for achieving progress become. For example, greater improvements in labor productivity, greater progress in technological and cultural revolutions, better development of natural resources, an increase in the number of factories and mines put into production, more powerful support from industry to agriculture, a broader road opened up by agriculture for industrial development, and richer construction experience and more perfect production increase measures, etc. At the same time, they also fail to see the strong desire of the people of the whole country to rapidly change China's poverty and backwardness, and the massive mass movement formed under the correct leadership of the Party, which is the most active and constant factor in promoting the sustained progressive development of China's economy. Of course, the rate of progress in the national economy may not be exactly the same every year, and there will be highs and lows. However, it must not be assumed that as the base increases, the rate of progress will become smaller and smaller, or even impossible. This statement is not only theoretically untenable, but also cannot withstand the refutation of facts. For example, the growth rate of industrial production during China's first five-year plan was originally very high, but in 1958 and 1959 (1959 is the planned number - hereinafter the same), the growth rate of industrial production far exceeded the level of the previous five years and did not decrease due to the increase in the base. Taking steel, coal, grain, and cotton as examples, the average annual growth rate of steel was 31.7% in the first five-year plan and 50% in the past two years; the growth rate of coal was 14.4% in the first five-year plan and 60% in the past two years; the growth rate of grain was 3.7% in the first five-year plan and 22% in the past two years; the growth rate of cotton was 4.7% in the first five-year plan and 19% in the past two years. The whole country is like this, and our province is no exception. This shows that although the development of the national economy is wave-like, the basic characteristics of the development of the socialist national economy are continuous progress and upsurge, rather than a smaller and smaller rate of progress. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "The development speed of the national economy cannot be the same every year. It is normal for some years to be higher and some years to be lower. It is certain that our economy is always growing year by year, and we are able to maintain a progressive development speed." ("The Victory of Marxism-Leninism in China")
    Due to the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, the unparalleled role of the general line for socialist construction, the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958 and 1959, the great harvest in the autumn of 1959, the fact that the people's communes have embarked on a path of sound development, and the acceleration of the pace of the technological revolution, it can be predicted that a better and more comprehensive situation of continued progress in 1960 will inevitably arrive in the whole country and the whole province.

### 送旧迎新，年年跃进

    送旧迎新，年年跃进
    如果说，力争上游，这是我们时代人们精神面貌的特征，那末，年年跃进，就是我们社会主义国家国民经济发展的常规。
    但是，还有一种比较流行的论调：国民经济的基数越大，跃进幅度就越小。言下之意，随着我国经济的发展，不断跃进将会成为不可能的事。这是一种悲观论调，是对于我国国民经济能够持久地保持跃进局面缺乏信心的表现。这些人只看到了国民经济的基数越大，要保持一定的生产发展速度，在绝对量上就要求产品增加得更多这一面，而看不到基数越大，工农业生产越发展，物质基础越扩大，实现跃进的有利条件和潜在力量也就越来越多、越来越大的另一面。例如：劳动生产率的更大的提高，技术革命和文化革命的更大的进展，自然资源的更好的开发，投入生产的厂矿单位的增多，工业对农业的更有力的支援，农业为工业发展开辟的更广阔的道路，以及建设经验越来越丰富，增产措施越来越完善，等等。同时，他们也看不到全国人民要求迅速地改变我国贫穷和落后面貌的强烈愿望，以及在党的正确领导下所形成的声势浩大的群众运动，是推动我国经济持久地跃进发展的最积极的、经常的因素。当然，国民经济每年的跃进幅度，不可能完全一样，而会有高有低，可是，决不能认为，基数增大，跃进的幅度就越来越小，甚至不能跃进。这种说法，不但在理论上站不住脚，而且也经不起事实的批驳。例如，我国第一个五年计划期间工业生产的增长速度本来是很高的，但是在1958年和1959年（1959年是计划数——下同），工业生产的增长速度远远超过了前五年的水平，并没有因基数增大而降低。以钢、煤、粮、棉来说，每年的平均增长速度，钢在第一个五年是31．7％，近两年是50％；煤在第一个五年是14．4％，近两年是60％；粮食在第一个五年是3．7％，近两年是22％；棉花在第一个五年是4．7％，近两年是19％。全国是这样，我省也不例外。这就说明，尽管国民经济的发展是波浪式的，但是作为社会主义国民经济发展的基本特征，是持续的跃进和高涨，而不是跃进幅度越来越小。正如刘少奇同志所说的：“国民经济的发展速度，不可能每年都是一样的。有的年份较高，有的年份较低，这是正常的现象。可以肯定，我们的经济总是逐年增长的，而且我们是能够保持跃进的发展速度的。”（“马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利”）
    由于中央和省委的正确领导，由于社会主义建设总路线的无比巨大的作用，由于1958年和1959年工农业生产的大跃进，由于1959年秋季的大丰收，由于人民公社已经走上了健全发展的道路，由于技术革命步伐的加快，可以预料，在全国和全省，1960年的更好更全面地继续跃进的形势必然到来。
