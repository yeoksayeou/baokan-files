Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Transportation workers in northern provinces are fully utilizing frozen rivers to carry out ice transportation.

Currently, Hebei Province has newly built and repaired more than 20,000 sleds and opened more than 1,000 kilometers of ice roads. Among the ice transportation tools, there are those pulled by horses, those dragged by people, and those pulled by machines. Huai'an County uses sleds for transportation, and one sled can transport 40 tons of materials per day, which is dozens of times more efficient than manual carrying. In early December, Longhua County in Chengde Prefecture held a mobilization meeting of more than 1,000 people and issued the battle slogan of "Demanding Transport Capacity from Ice凌." In just over half a month, they opened 258 kilometers of ice roads and centrally transported more than 4,000 tons of materials for the main lines.

Jilin Province has built more than 28,000 sleds, adding new strength to short-distance transportation. More than 2,000 large sleds manufactured by Jilin Regional Shipping Company are towed by tractors to carry out ice transportation on the Songhua River. A 100-kilometer-long ice road between Yilan and Jiamusi in Heilongjiang Province has begun transportation. Liaoning Province organized more than 3,500 sleds and transported more than 3,700 tons of materials in three days. Gansu Province has also built more than 10,000 ice transportation tools and put them into transportation one after another.

The Transportation Department of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region plans to transport about 400,000 tons of materials through ice roads this winter and next spring. Recently, they held an on-site meeting on ice road transportation in Zalaite Banner, vigorously promoting the banner’s experience in widely developing ice road transportation. Zalaite Banner used ice roads not only to transport a large amount of materials for external transport, but also for local factory, mine, and construction site transportation, as well as field manure accumulation. Some of these ice roads are natural river courses, and some are built by artificial watering. It is simple and easy to build ice roads by artificial watering, and they can freeze overnight. Now, within the Zalaite Banner factory, ice roads are used for transportation between workshops, warehouses, and shops, which is very low cost and effective.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th. In the eastern plain area of Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, a mass movement to rush to build various ships and try every means to expand shipping capacity has recently been launched. Up to now, Fugou, Yanling, Xihua, Xuchang and other counties in this prefecture have built 334 tugboats, wooden boats, reed mat boats, Vitex negundo boats, canvas boats, and sheepskin boats, with a total carrying capacity of 1,490 tons, which is equivalent to increasing the transportation capacity of 148 Jiefang-brand trucks.

The mass shipbuilding movement in these four counties is being carried out in conjunction with the river network water conservancy construction movement. Since the beginning of winter, this area has excavated 1,944 li of river networks, and the Xu (chang) Fu (gou) Canal, which is 106 li long, 20 meters wide at the bottom, and 3 to 7 meters deep, has also been completed recently. The initial completion of these river transport networks has opened up broad prospects for the development of shipping in this area. Therefore, the counties put forward the slogan of "digging thousands of miles of canals and rushing to build ten thousand sailboats" and launched a shipbuilding movement in every county and commune.

In the shipbuilding movement of these four counties, the secretaries took the lead, the whole people took action, relied on their own efforts, used local materials, used indigenous methods, adapted to local conditions, and achieved fast shipbuilding speed, good quality, many types, material saving, and low cost. Each reed mat boat with a load of three tons is 6.4 meters long, 1.7 meters wide, and 7 decimeters deep. It uses 0.5 cubic meters of wood to make the frame, 25 reed mats to make the shell, 300 kilograms of asphalt, 40 kilograms of iron nails, and can be made in 17 work days at a cost of 282 yuan. This kind of reed mat boat saves 1.59 cubic meters of wood, 72 workdays, and reduces the cost by 120.5 yuan compared with wooden boats of the same load, and it is more flexible, has a shallow draft, is sturdy and durable, and the ship speed is 37% faster than wooden boats of the same load.

At the beginning of shipbuilding, the Party committees of each county and people's commune put forward the slogan "Work hard for a winter, every commune and team can pass ships, realize water conservancy and shipping, and facilitate both production and transportation," which mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses. After the Fugou County Party Committee put forward the task of manufacturing 150 sailboats by the end of 1959, a shipbuilding committee was established with County Party Secretary Wang Dian'an as the head. If there were no materials, the masses were mobilized to raise them; if there were no technicians, a group of carpenters and blacksmiths were transferred from various communes, together with the repair workers of the machinery factory, to form a shipbuilding factory with 160 people; the county party committee called on relevant departments to vigorously support if the shipbuilding lacked equipment. As a result, in just over 20 days, the county built three tugboats and 199 reed mat boats, Vitex negundo boats, etc.

    充分利用冰道  提高运输效率
    北方广泛开展冰上运输
    许昌专区自力更生大造船只实现水利航运化
    新华社4日讯　北方各省交通战线职工充分利用冰封的河道，开展冰上运输。
    目前，河北省已经新造和整修了两万多张爬犁，开辟冰道一千多公里。在冰上运输工具中，有马拉的、人拖的，也有机器牵引的。怀安县用爬犁运输，一部爬犁一天能运四十吨物资，运输效率比起人力肩挑要提高几十倍。承德专区的隆化县在12月初召开了一千多人的誓师大会，发出了“向冰凌要运力”的战斗口号，半个多月就开辟了二百五十八公里冰道，为干线集运了四千多吨物资。
    吉林省已经造好两万八千多张爬犁，为短途运输增添了新力量。吉林地区航运公司制造的二千多张大型爬犁，用拖拉机牵引，在松花江上开展冰上运输。黑龙江省依兰至佳木斯之间一条长达一百多公里的冰道，已开始运输。辽宁省组织了三千五百多张爬犁，三天内就运出物资三千七百多吨。甘肃省也已造好一万多台冰上运输工具，陆续投入运输。
    内蒙古自治区交通厅计划去冬今春通过冰道运输四十万吨左右的物资。最近，他们在扎赉特旗召开了冰道运输现场会议，大力推广这个旗广泛开展冰道运输的经验。扎赉特旗利用冰道不仅运输了大量外运物资，而且当地厂矿、工地运输，田间积肥运输也都利用了冰道。这些冰道有的是自然河道，有的是人工浇水修筑的。用人工浇水修筑冰道，简便易行，一夜之间就可结冻。现在，扎赉特旗工厂内部车间之间，仓库、商店之间都用冰道搬运，成本很低，收效很快。
    新华社郑州4日电　河南省许昌专区东部平原地区，最近开展了群众性的赶造各种船只、千方百计扩大航运能力的运动。到目前为止，这个专区的扶沟、鄢陵、西华、许昌等县已经造起拖轮、木船、苇席船、荆条船、帆布船、羊皮船三百三十四只，总载重量一千四百九十吨，等于增加了一百四十八辆解放牌汽车的运输能力。
    这四个县群众性的造船运动，是结合河网化水利建设运动开展起来的。入冬以来，这个地区已经开挖河网一千九百四十四华里，长一百零六华里，底宽二十米、深三至七米的许（昌）扶（沟）运河也在最近建成。这些河运网的初步建成，为这个地区发展航运事业开辟了广阔的道路。各县因此提出“开挖运河千里，赶造帆船万只”的口号，开展起县县社社的造船运动。
    这四个县在造船运动中，都是书记动手，全民行动，自力更生，就地取材，土法上马，因地制宜，做到造船速度快、质量好、种类多，材料省、成本低。每只载重三吨的苇席船，长六点四米，宽一点七米，深七分米，用半立方米木材做架，二十五条苇席做壳，涂沥青三百公斤，用铁钉四十公斤，十七个工，就可造成，造价二百八十二元。这种苇席船比同等载重的木船节约木材一点五九立方米，省工七十二个，降低造价一百二十点五元，而且行动灵活，吃水浅，坚固耐用，船速也比同等载重量的木船快37％。
    开始造船时，各县和人民公社的党委都提出“大干一冬天，社社队队都通船，实现水利航运化，生产交通两方便”的口号，调动了广大群众的积极性。中共扶沟县委提出1959年底制造帆船一百五十只的任务后，以县委书记王殿安为首成立造船委员会，没有物料，就发动群众筹集；没有技术人员，就从各公社抽调一批木匠、铁匠，同机械厂的修配工人一起，组成一个有一百六十人的造船厂；造船缺乏器材，县委就号召有关部门大力支援。结果只二十多天，全县就造出拖轮三只，苇席船、荆条船等一百九十九只。
