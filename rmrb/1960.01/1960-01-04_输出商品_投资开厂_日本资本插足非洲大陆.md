    Exporting Goods, Investing in Factories
    Japanese Capital Intervenes in the African Continent
    (Reported by this newspaper) Japanese monopoly capital is attempting to accelerate its expansion into the African continent. According to the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun," "Currently, Africa is Japan's largest market after North America and Southeast Asia." Taking textiles as an example, the textiles Japan exports to Nigeria, Uganda, Tanganyika, and Kenya account for about 40% of Japan's textile exports. According to the West German "Industrie-Kurier," Japanese exports to Kenya have increased from 1 million pounds in 1955 to 4.65 million pounds in 1958, rising from the sixth to the second largest importing country in Kenya. From 1955 to 1958, Japanese exports to the Union of South Africa increased from 2.82 million pounds to 3.36 million pounds.
    Japan is also trying its best to find ways to export capital to Africa. The "Mainichi Shimbun" said, "Africa does not adopt a cautious attitude towards foreign exchange like Southeast Asian countries, and it is easy for Japan to remit profits back to its home country." It believes that Africa "has an investment-friendly environment and is very attractive." There are also reports that Japan plans to build factories in Sudan and Somaliland this year, and even hopes to build industries in the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic.

    输出商品　投资开厂
    日本资本插足非洲大陆
    本报讯　日本垄断资本正企图加紧向非洲大陆进行扩张。据日本“每日新闻”说，“目前非洲对于日本来说是仅次于北美、东南亚的大市场”。拿纺织品来说，日本输往尼日利亚、乌干达、坦噶尼喀和怯尼亚四个国家的纺织品，就占日本输出的纺织品的40％左右。据西德“工业信使报”报道，日本对怯尼亚的出口已经由1955年的一百万英镑增加到1958年的四百六十五万英镑，从而在怯尼亚的输入国中已从第六位上升到第二位。从1955年到1958年，日本对南非联邦的出口由二百八十二万英镑增加到三百三十六万英镑。
    日本还极力寻找门路，向非洲输出资本。“每日新闻”说，“非洲对于外汇并不像东南亚各国那样采取小心翼翼的态度，而日本把利润汇回本国也是容易的”，它认为，非洲“有适宜于投资的环境，很吸引人”。还有消息说，日本今年准备在苏丹、索马里兰建立工厂，甚至希望在阿联的埃及地区建设工业。
