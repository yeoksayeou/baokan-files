Large Numbers of Factories and Mines Fulfill January Plans Ahead of Schedule
　　Wuhan, Over 300 Factories
　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th: Three hundred and twelve factories in Wuhan have completed their January production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded their quotas.
　　Since the New Year, in order to realize a sustained leap forward in 1960, these factories and enterprises have widely promoted the advanced experiences of Daye Steel Plant in organizing "attack campaigns" and Anshan Iron and Steel's technical performance competitions. They have also launched activities to learn from Ma Xueli, thus making the mass movement more lively and dynamic, and resulting in a large number of technical innovations. Many factories have not only completed their January output value plans ahead of schedule, but also their major production indicators such as product output, quality, cost, and labor productivity. Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory combined the organization of "attack campaigns" with the activities of learning from Ma Xueli in the form of "production sports meets," which made production rise step by step. In just half a month, it overfulfilled its January output value plan by 1.28%. Then it completed its product output plan with good quality, and also overfulfilled its labor productivity and cost reduction plans. Jiang'an Vehicle Factory, an advanced collective that attended the National Heroes Conference last year, has seen its production situation getting better and better in January. The plan for the first ten days of the month was completed three days ahead of schedule, and the plan for the middle ten days was completed four days ahead of schedule. By the 20th, the entire factory had comprehensively overfulfilled the monthly plan ahead of schedule, and achieved safe production.
　　Tianjin, Two Hundred and Thirty-Four Factories
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 28th:
  On the eve of the Spring Festival, good news kept pouring in from the industrial front in Tianjin. As of the 25th, according to statistics from the six districts in the city, 234 factories have completed their January production plans ahead of schedule.
　　After winning a good start this year, the workers of these factories immediately launched a wave of technical performance competitions, making production rise step by step. Tianjin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, which historically didn't produce finished products at the beginning of the month, closely cooperated in the technical performance competition. The workers of each workshop cooperated closely to carry out the processing of supporting parts, and on the 19th, they overfulfilled the January production plan of gear shapers by four units. Tianjin Raincoat Factory organized technical performance competitions, and 80% of the factory's production workers exceeded their quotas. The factory's daily production level increased by 20% compared with before the New Year, and the January production plan was completed nine days ahead of schedule. Since the beginning of this year, North China Oxygen Plant has implemented ten major technical organizational measures, eliminated weak links in production, and comprehensively overfulfilled various production targets ahead of schedule by the 22nd, while also achieving safe production.
　　Jilin, Forty-Three Small Coal Mines
　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 25th: Forty-three small coal mines in Jilin Province completed their January production plans eight days ahead of schedule. As of January 23, the raw coal produced exceeded the monthly plan of each mine by an average of 5.9%, and the average daily output increased by 7% compared with December last year, creating the highest record since the production of small coal mines in the province.
　　These small coal mines were established in 1958 using indigenous methods. After a year of transformation in 1959, they have developed from small indigenous groups into enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods. At the beginning of 1960, the workers of these coal mines launched a technical innovation movement centered on "five reforms": reforming development methods, reforming coal mining methods, reforming transportation conditions, reforming tools and equipment, and improving labor conditions, so that the proportion of mechanized and semi-mechanized production continued to increase. Eleven key small coal mines such as Laotougou and Shansonggang in Yanbian have installed three major pieces of equipment: hoists, water pumps, and fans. Yongji County Coal Mine realized twenty-two technical innovations in the first and middle ten days of January, and promoted fifteen advanced experiences. The average production efficiency increased by 13% compared with December last year.
　　Taiyuan, Thirteen Factories
　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th: Thirteen factories in Taiyuan, including Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Taihang Instrument Factory, and Jiangyang Chemical Plant, have completed their January production plans ahead of schedule. Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, which completed its monthly plan eleven days ahead of schedule, achieved 101.9% of the total output value, 101.3% of labor productivity, 100% of locomotive production, and 107.1% of freight car production. Costs were significantly reduced, and the quality of all products was qualified. The average daily output level of Shele Iron Smelting Plant increased by 30.2% compared with December last year, the qualified rate of pig iron reached 100%, and the cost per ton of iron was reduced to 180 yuan.
　　These factories and enterprises that completed their monthly plans ahead of schedule have achieved remarkable results in making great efforts in technical innovation. Since the New Year, Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant has innovated 425 technologies, including 19 major ones, which increased work efficiency by one to seventy-four times respectively.
