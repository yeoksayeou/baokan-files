Great Innovation in Canteen Cooking Utensils: Adding Labor Force to the Production Front

Tunchang County rural public canteens use machines for cooking rice and dishes, freeing up more than 10,000 laborers. Zhenning County canteen service personnel reduced by nearly half, saving one million labor days a year.

Our newspaper Taiyuan, 5th dispatch: The cooking tools in the rural public canteens of Tunchang County, Shanxi Province, have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, liberating a large number of laborers to invest in the front line of production. The masses praised the benefits of the cooking utensil reform, saying: "In the past, people pulled the bellows with sweat all over their faces, and animals turned the mill slowly; now, machines roar into action, saving manpower, labor, and time."

Tunchang County has a total of 1,910 rural public canteens, with 316,000 people participating, accounting for 91.8% of the total agricultural population. In order to further improve the canteens, the Tunchang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to strengthening ideological education and improving management systems, launched a mass campaign for cooking utensil reform in November last year. After half a month of effort, the county reformed, imitated, and created 11,401 various cooking utensils and grain processing tools, with 62% of the canteens achieving mechanization and 38% achieving semi-mechanization. In the past, there were more than 23,940 cooks in the county's canteens, accounting for 16.95% of the county's total labor force, and more than 5,400 head of livestock, accounting for 16.9% of the total livestock. Cooking operations were generally manual labor, with very low efficiency. An average cook could only cook for about 13 people, and each head of livestock could only mill 100 to 200 catties of rice and flour per day. After the cooking utensil reform, an average cook can cook for 60 to 80 people, and each thimble mill can mill 800 to 1,000 catties of rice and flour per day with animal power, and 2,000 to 3,000 catties per day with power. The average number of cooks per canteen has been reduced from 12.5 to 3.8, and the number of livestock has been reduced from an average of 2.8 to 0.3. A total of more than 16,000 laborers and about 4,800 livestock have been freed up in the county's canteens to participate in agricultural production. The cooking utensil reform has also saved grain. According to the statistics of 88 canteens in the Nanchen People's Commune, in the past, when rice and flour were milled manually, due to the large number of mills used, high grain consumption, and reasons such as coarse milling and unclean winnowing, more than three catties of grain were lost for every 100 catties. After the realization of mechanized processing, this situation has changed, and the entire commune can save more than 194,000 catties of grain per year.

After the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization of cooking tools, there are more favorable conditions for improving canteen work. The intensity of labor has been reduced, and cooks are putting more energy and time into improving the quality of food. Now, more than 80% of the canteens in the county have achieved refined processing of coarse grains and diversified food varieties, and more than 500 canteens have set up small shops. The Liujiaping Canteen has also set up special diets for the elderly and the sick, so that everyone is satisfied with eating their fill and eating well. Cooks also have more time to study politics and culture and participate in recreational activities. Cooks in the Wuyuan and Baquan People's Communes have participated in amateur theory and culture study classes.

Tunchang County has strengthened the organizational leadership of the cooking utensil reform work at all levels. The county established a welfare committee and a cooking utensil reform office. The Party committees of each commune and the Party branches of the management areas have designated personnel to be responsible for leading the cooking utensil reform work. The county party committee focused on the Liujiaping Canteen, which realized the mechanization of cooking utensils, held on-site meetings, exchanged and promoted advanced experiences, and took Tunliu Commune as a banner, organizing a red flag competition between communes. Each commune also established pace-setters and carried out cooking utensil reform competition movements between management areas, canteens, and people, greatly promoting the speed of reform.

In order to promote the smooth progress of the cooking utensil reform work, Tunchang County established a cooking utensil reform technology network. Each of the county's 19 communes and more than 500 management areas established technical reform guidance groups, mobilizing more than 9,500 people to participate in the cooking utensil reform work. The Party Secretary of Baodian Commune led the technicians of the commune factory to go deep into each management area for guidance. Within ten days, they helped the management area reform more than 300 cooking utensils.

Each people's commune adopted the method of self-reliance, using local materials, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, making the cooking utensil reform fast, good, and economical. Among the 11,400 cooking utensils and grain processing tools reformed in the county, about 80% were innovated by the canteens themselves. The Liujiaping Canteen used six man-days and one yuan and five jiao to remodel a foot-operated blower, which could boil three pots of water at a time in only 30 to 40 minutes. In the past, it took 70 to 80 minutes to boil a pot of water using a bellows. The Dongnao Management Area installed tap water pipes using wooden troughs, saving three laborers who carried water. Among the cooking utensils reformed by the canteens in the county, 131 pieces used power machinery, and 11,270 pieces used local machinery, spending less money and accomplishing more.

The cooking utensil reform work was carried out with different priorities. At that time, Tunchang County urgently needed to solve the problem of excessive labor force occupied by grain processing. According to statistics, more than 17,900 strong laborers were used in the county for rice and flour processing, water carrying, and bellows pulling alone, accounting for more than 75% of the total number of canteen service personnel. Therefore, in the cooking utensil reform, thimble mills, thimble rollers, and other rice and flour processing tools, as well as blowers, tap water pipes, and other main cooking utensils were first manufactured, saving a large amount of manpower and animal power; then, small cooking utensils such as vegetable cutters, rolling pins, and dumpling shakers were reformed to further save manpower and improve labor efficiency.

Our newspaper Guiyang, 5th dispatch: The rural canteens in Zhenning County, Guizhou Province, have reformed their cooking utensils, greatly improving work efficiency, saving labor, and reducing expenses. By December 10th last year, 1,835 canteens, accounting for 92% of the total number of canteens in the county, had already used tap water, water or animal power to mill rice, earthen cranes to lift rice, and multiple stoves with one fire; many canteens also used new tools for cutting vegetables, delivering food, and delivering firewood.

Zhenning County is a mountainous area inhabited by the Buyi ethnic group. The terrain is mountainous with many slopes, and transportation is inconvenient. It is difficult to get drinking water and water for use. Some canteens had to cross mountains and ridges to fetch water from places several miles away. Milling rice and grinding corn flour also relied on manual operation, with low efficiency and occupying a large amount of labor. Canteens had many people and large rice steamers, which required two or three young and strong people to carry them up and down, which was very laborious and easily scalded people or spilled grain. Therefore, reforming cooking utensils became an urgent requirement of the masses.

The Zhenning County Committee of the Communist Party of China studied this situation and decided to mobilize the masses to carry out a large-scale cooking utensil reform, implementing the policy of focusing on indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods, using local materials to manufacture various earthen machines. The Maocao Management Area of Jianglong Commune, with carpenters as technical guides, members all worked together, and in one day of concentrated effort, installed water diversion channels or water pipes for all 23 canteens in the area, using tap water; rice milling and flour grinding were changed to using animal power and water power, rice carrying used earthen cranes, and multiple stoves were realized with one fire. Many canteens also built water filtration ponds and water filtration channels to ensure that drinking water and water for use were clean and hygienic. Some places also created more efficient tools such as one animal pulling eight mills, one animal pulling four mortars, and hand-cranked eight-knife vegetable cutting machines.

Due to the widespread innovation of cooking utensils in rural canteens, a large amount of manpower and material resources have been saved, supporting agricultural production. After the Yongning and Shaying Management Areas of Yongning Commune basically realized water supply automation, more than 60 laborers who carried water were saved alone. In the past, 69 main laborers in the Machang Management Area of Muyi Commune could only grind more than 1,600 catties of corn flour per day. After changing to animal power to pull the mill, only 17 auxiliary laborers were used, and 3,800 catties could be ground in one day. In the past, two people in the Beiguan Canteen of Chengguan Commune pounded one mortar, but now it has been changed to one ox pulling four mortars, increasing work efficiency by seven times. Rice steamers that used to require two or three young and strong people to lift can now be handled by only one auxiliary laborer using an earthen crane. In the past, four stoves in the Mohao Canteen of Liuma Commune required two people to stoke the fire and two people to get firewood; after changing to one fire burning four stoves, manpower and materials were saved, and only one person was needed to stoke the fire and one person to get firewood, saving more than 500 catties of firewood every day. At present, the number of canteen service personnel in the county has been reduced from the original 8,127 to 4,907, accounting for only 1.9% of the number of people eating, saving more than 1.17 million labor days a year.

    自力更生　因陋就简先粗后精　土洋并举
    食堂炊具大革新　生产前线添劳力
    屯长县农村公共食堂煮饭烧菜用机器，抽出劳力一万多个镇宁县食堂服务人员减少近半，一年可节约百万个劳动日
    本报太原5日电　山西省屯长县农村公共食堂的炊事工具基本实现了机械化和半机械化，解放出大批劳动力投入生产第一线。群众歌颂炊具改革的好处说：“过去是人拉风箱满头汗，畜拉碾磨转得慢；现在是开动机器轰轰转，省人省工省时间。”
    屯长县农村共有公共食堂一千九百一十个，参加食堂的人数达三十一万六千人，占农业总人口的91．8％。为了把食堂进一步办好，中共屯长县委除了加强思想教育工作和健全管理制度以外，在去年11月间发动群众大闹炊具改革。经过半个月的努力，全县共改革、仿制和创制了各种炊具和粮食加工工具一万一千四百零一件，62％的食堂实现了机械化，38％的食堂实现了半机械化。过去，全县食堂中共有炊事人员二万三千九百四十多人，占全县劳动力总数的16．95％，共用牲畜五千四百多头，占牲畜总数的16．9％。炊事操作一般是手工劳动，效率很低，一个炊事员平均只能做约十三个人的饭，每头牲口一天只能碾米面一百到二百斤。炊具改革以后，平均每个炊事员能做六十到八十人的饭，每盘顶针碾、磨，用畜力一天能碾米、面八百到一千斤，用动力每天可碾米、面二千斤到三千斤。平均每个食堂由十二点五个炊事人员，缩减到三点八人，牲畜由平均二点八头，缩减为零点三头。全县食堂共腾出劳动力一万六千多个、畜力四千八百左右头参加农业生产。炊具改革后，还节约了粮食。仅据南陈人民公社八十八个食堂统计，过去用人工碾米面，由于用碾磨数量多、消耗粮食也多，以及碾不细、搧不净等原因，每一百斤损耗粮食三斤多。实现了加工机械化以后，这个状况改变了，全公社一年共可节约粮食十九万四千多斤。
    实现炊事工具机械化和半机械化以后，有了改进食堂工作更为有利的条件。劳动强度减轻了，炊事人员把更多的精力和时间用在提高饭菜质量方面。现在全县已有80％以上的食堂做到了粗粮细作、饭菜花样多，有五百多个食堂设立了小卖部。刘家坪食堂还设立了老年、病人小灶，做到了吃饱、吃好，人人满意。炊事人员也有了更多的时间学习政治和文化，参加文娱活动。吾元、八泉等人民公社的炊事人员都参加了理论和文化业余学习班。
    屯长县层层加强炊具改革工作的组织领导。县里成立了福利委员会和炊具改革办公室。各公社党委和管理区党支部都确定了专人负责领导炊具改革工作。县委以实现炊具机械化的刘家坪食堂为重点，召开了现场会议，交流和推广先进经验，并以屯留公社为旗帜，组织了社与社的红旗竞赛。各公社也树立了标兵，开展了管理区与管理区、食堂与食堂和人与人的炊具改革竞赛运动，大大促进了改革速度。
    为了推动炊具改革工作的顺利进展，屯长县建立了炊具改革技术网。全县十九个公社和五百多个管理区都成立了技术改革指导组，发动了九千五百多人参加炊具改革工作。鲍店公社党委书记带领公社工厂的技术员，深入各管理区进行指导，十天内，帮助管理区改革了炊具三百多件。
    各人民公社采取了自力更生、就地取材、土洋结合的办法，炊具改革又多又快又好又省。全县改革的一万一千四百多件炊具和粮食加工工具中，有80％左右是食堂自己革新的。刘家坪食堂用六个人工和一元五角钱，就改制了脚踏吹风机一个，一次可烧开三锅水，只用三十到四十分钟。过去用风箱搧火，烧开一锅水需七十到八十分钟。东脑管理区用木槽安起了自来水管，节省了三个担水的劳动力。全县各食堂改革炊具中，采用动力机械一百三十一件，土机械一万一千二百七十件，花钱少、办事大。
    炊具改革工作是分别轻重缓急进行的。当时，屯长县迫切需要解决的是粮食加工占用劳动力过多的问题。据统计，全县仅米面加工、担水、拉风箱等项共用强劳力一万七千九百多个，占食堂服务人员总数的75％以上。因而，在炊具改革中首先制造了顶针磨、顶针碾等米面加工用具和吹风、自来水管等主要炊具，节省了大量人力、畜力；然后改革了切菜、擀面、摇疙瘩等小炊具，进一步节约了人力，提高了劳动效率。
    本报贵阳5日电　贵州省镇宁县农村食堂改革炊事用具，大大提高了工效，节省了劳动力，减少了开支。到去年12月10日，占全县食堂总数92％的一千八百三十五个食堂，已经用上了自来水、用水力畜力碾米、用土起重机抬饭、一火多灶；不少食堂切菜、送饭、送柴也用了新工具。
    镇宁县是布依族聚居的山区，境内山大坡多，交通不便，吃水用水很困难，有些食堂用水，要翻山越岭跑到几里路外的地方去挑。碾米、磨玉米面也都靠人工操作，工效低，占用劳动力多。食堂人多饭甑大，要两三个青壮年担上担下，非常费力，还容易烫伤人或抛撒粮食。因此，改革炊事用具成为群众的迫切要求。
    中共镇宁县委研究了这种情况，决定发动群众大搞炊具改革，贯彻以土为主、土洋结合的方针，就地取材制造各种土机械。江龙公社毛草管理区由木匠当技术指导，社员人人动手，突击一天，就给全区二十三个食堂装好了引水道或引水管，用上了自来水；碾米磨面改用畜力和水力，担饭用土起重机，并实现了一火多灶。不少食堂还修建了滤水池、滤水道，做到饮水用水清洁卫生。有些地方还创造了一畜拉八盘磨、一畜拉四台碓和手摇八把刀切菜机等工效更高的工具。
    农村食堂由于普遍革新炊事用具，节约了大量人力和物力，支援了农业生产。永宁公社永宁、沙营两个管理区，基本实现用水自来化后，仅挑水的劳力就节省了六十多个。募役公社马场管理区过去六十九个主要劳力磨玉米面，每天只能磨一千六百多斤，改用畜力拉磨后，只用十七个附带劳动力，一天就能磨三千八百斤。城关公社北关食堂过去两人舂一台碓，现在改用一牛拉四台碓，提高工效七倍。过去要两三个青壮年才能抬得动的饭甑，现在用土起重机，只需要一个附带劳动力掌握。六马公社磨薅食堂，过去四个锅灶要两人烧火，两人弄柴；改为一火烧四个灶后，省人省料，只要一人烧火，一人弄柴，每天节省柴草五百多斤。目前，全县食堂服务人员已由原来的八千一百二十七人减为四千九百零七人，只占吃饭人数的1．9％，一年可节省一百一十七万多个劳动日。（附图片）
