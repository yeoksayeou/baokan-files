Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 1st: The 70,000 workers on the Yangtze River shipping front have victoriously achieved a flying start. During the New Year's Day holiday, they all stuck to their work posts with soaring enthusiasm. On this day, they completed a cargo volume of over 73,000 tons, exceeding the average daily output planned for January 1960 by 25%, more than doubling the average daily output in January 1959, and increasing by 12.65% compared to the average daily output in December. The cargo turnover on this day reached more than 45.66 million ton-kilometers, exceeding the average daily output planned for January 1960 by 9%, and increasing by 64.5% compared to the average daily output in January 1959.

Xinhua News Agency, Luda, January 2nd: Dalian Seaport workers achieved a flying start on New Year's Day. On this day, the seaport's throughput exceeded the daily plan by more than 2,200 tons.

On New Year's Day morning, the waters of Dalian Seaport were as smooth as a mirror, and the cargo ships docked alongside the wharves were adorned with colorful flags celebrating the festival. All the port workers launched a competition between ships, vehicles, and teams from the very beginning of their work, and completed their team plans ahead of schedule. The Jing Xinyou loading and unloading team, a national advanced collective, created a new record of loading 135 tons of cargo into the ship's hold per hour in the first shift, exceeding the plan by more than two times. After completing their own plan ahead of schedule, they also drew people to support three other teams, allowing the entire cargo ship to be loaded 40 minutes ahead of schedule. Zhao Yuquan and Han Yuchuan, two loading and unloading teams in the Eastern District, proposed the slogan "Fast unhooking, fast hooking" when loading cargo for the "Peace Thirty-Three" vessel, driving the other seven teams to accelerate the ship loading efficiency together, enabling the ship to depart for Shanghai ahead of schedule.

In the past year, the workers of Dalian Seaport created the highest throughput record since the port's opening. Before the end of the year, all the port workers conducted a series of preparatory work for this year's flying start and complete success. On the 30th, all the port workers held a mobilization and competition rally, deciding to launch a new socialist labor competition centered on fast loading, fast unloading, and fast transportation, and to launch a dragon-type collaborative competition with railway departments and production departments to accelerate the turnover of trains and ships and improve transportation efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 1st: The Shenyang Railway Bureau is doing everything possible to transport production and construction materials for 1960 ahead of schedule, ensuring a flying start for factories and mines. The bureau has already transported 4,394 carloads of fuel, raw materials, materials, and equipment needed by various factories and mines in January 1960, as well as a batch of New Year and Spring Festival supply materials.

In order to organize early transportation, the bureau's Party committee recently dispatched five working groups to go deep into railway area stations and sections to help with work, implement the principle of "ensuring key points and comprehensively arranging," and queue up the materials that need to be transported urgently at present. Each major station has organized cargo source investigation teams, with freight clerks contracting by region and line, going deep into factories and mines to organize cargo sources and help overcome transportation difficulties.

During this period, the bureau's workers also vigorously tapped transportation potential, organized empty cars to carry goods as a sideline, and transported a large number of daily production necessities. For example, Xiaotun Station used the empty coal cars returning from Anshan Station to Daguantun Station to load more than 400 carloads of limestone for Fushun Cement Factory. Shahekou Station used empty boxcars to load glass from Dalian Glass Factory. The bureau also used the method of sideline transportation to transport 1,615 carloads of materials needed for the 1960 production ahead of schedule for various factories.

    运输线上形势好
    长江航运线上第一天货运量超额25％
    大连港吞吐量超过计划二千二百多吨
    沈阳铁路局提前运输四千三百多车物资
    据新华社武汉1日电　长江航运战线上的七万职工，胜利地夺得了开门红。元旦假日，他们个个坚守工作岗位，干劲冲天。这一天，完成了七万三千多吨的货运量，超过1960年元月份计划平均日产量25％，比1959年元月平均日产量增加一倍多，比12月平均日产量增长12．65％。这一天的货运周转量达到四千五百六十六万多吨公里，超过1960年元月计划平均日产量9％，比1959年元月平均日产量增长64．5％。
    新华社旅大2日电　大连海港职工元旦赢得开门红。这一天，海港吞吐量超过了日计划二千二百多吨。
    元旦早晨，大连海港的水面碧波如镜，停泊在码头旁边的货轮，桅杆上悬挂着庆祝节日的各色彩旗。全港职工从一开始工作就展开了船与船、车与车、小组与小组之间的竞赛，纷纷提前完成班组计划。全国先进集体荆信友装卸小组，在第一班里创造了每小时往船舱装货一百三十五吨的新纪录，超过计划两倍多。他们在提前完成自己的计划以后，还抽人支援其他三个小组，使全货船提前四十分钟装完。东区赵玉全和韩玉川两个装卸小组，在为和平三十三号轮船装货时，提出“快速摘钩，快速挂钩”的口号，带动其他七个小组，一起加快了装船效率，使轮船能够提前开往上海。
    大连海港的职工在过去一年里，创造了开港以来最高的吞吐量纪录。年底以前，全港职工就为今年的开门红、满堂红进行了一系列的准备工作。30日，全港职工举行誓师比武大会，决定展开新的以快装快卸快运为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛，并与铁路部门、生产部门展开一条龙协作大竞赛，使火车、轮船都能加速周转，提高运输效率。
    据新华社沈阳1日电　沈阳铁路局千方百计提前装运1960年生产建设物资，确保厂矿企业开门红。全局已经提前运输了各厂矿1960年1月份所需的燃料、原料、材料和设备四千三百九十四车，以及一批新年和春节供应物资。
    为了组织提前运输，这个局的党委最近派出五个工作组深入铁路地区站段帮助工作，贯彻“保证重点，全面安排”的方针，对当前急需运输的物资进行排队。各主要车站都组织货源调查小组，由货运员分片分线包干，深入厂矿组织货源，帮助克服装运困难。
    全局职工在这期间还大挖运输潜力，组织空车捎脚装运货物，装运大批日常生产必需的货物。如小屯车站就利用由鞍山站回到大官屯站的运煤空车，给抚顺水泥厂装运了四百多车石灰石。沙河口车站利用排空棚车装运了大连玻璃厂的玻璃。全局还利用捎脚运输的方法，提前为各厂装运了1960年生产所需的物资一千六百一十五车。
