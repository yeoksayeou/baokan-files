Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 31st: Vientiane Radio broadcasted a communiqué from the General Headquarters of the Lao Royal Armed Forces tonight, announcing that the General Headquarters of the Lao Royal Armed Forces has seized state power in Laos.

According to the communiqué, the Lao Royal Armed Forces Command seized power after "requesting that King Savang Vatthana of Laos assume the heavy responsibility of the country's current situation." Prior to this, the cabinet of Phoui Sananikone of Laos submitted its resignation to King Savang Vatthana of Laos.

According to the communiqué, the Lao Royal Armed Forces leaders who requested the seizure of power from the King of Laos included Soukanh Pathammavong, the honorary chairman of the so-called Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" and commander-in-chief of the Lao Royal Armed Forces, Van Rathikone, a key member of this committee and Chief of Staff of the Lao Royal Armed Forces, and Phoumi Nosavan, Inspector General of the Army. In the past few days, these leaders of the extremely pro-American Lao "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" have repeatedly deployed troops, tanks, and armored vehicles to stage demonstrations in Vientiane.

According to Vientiane Radio, the Phoui Sananikone cabinet submitted its resignation to the King of Laos on December 30th. Sananikone had reorganized his cabinet on December 19th; this cabinet did not include members of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests."

After Sananikone reorganized the cabinet, the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" announced its opposition to the cabinet reorganization and demanded that the government resign and dissolve the National Assembly.
