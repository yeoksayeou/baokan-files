Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 16th: Anshan Iron and Steel workers are advancing victoriously, achieving successive triumphs. Up to the 15th, the output of major products such as steel, pig iron, steel products, iron ore, artificial rich ore, coke, and refractory materials, all exceeded the plan for the first half of the month; compared with the same period in December last year, the production level increased by 0.6% to 14.6% respectively.

From the beginning of New Year's Day this year, a vigorous mass movement unfolded in various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel. The first joint technical performance competition week held by Anshan Iron and Steel from January 1st to 7th laid a solid foundation for the overall victory in production in the first ten days. Subsequently, starting from the 11th, the second joint technical performance competition week, centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, enabled Anshan Iron and Steel to achieve another great victory in production in the first half of the month.

Now, all the iron and steel forces of Anshan Iron and Steel are determined to make January a success from beginning to end and achieve a flying start in February. At Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 blast furnace, a nationally renowned red banner furnace, workers are fiercely attacking the three key points of improving smelting intensity, maintaining the tapping hole, and increasing air temperature, determined to raise the red banner of the national large blast furnace champion even higher in January. At Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 open-hearth furnace, a nationally renowned red banner open-hearth furnace, workers have established a technical innovation research group, constantly summarizing and exchanging experience, determined to overproduce three thousand tons of steel in January.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th: Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant achieved daily success in the first half of January, with steel production fulfilling 100.79% of the plan and steel products production fulfilling 104.2% of the plan. The average daily production level has greatly improved compared with the second half of December last year: steel increased by 60.2%, and steel products increased by 9.5%. Product quality has also improved significantly, with the qualified rate of steel reaching 99.38%.

Since entering 1960, the workers of this steel plant, in order to win the victory of continued leap forward, quickly launched a performance competition centered on high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, low consumption, and safe production. A vigorous new atmosphere has emerged in production. In just fifteen days, the steelmaking department alone has achieved eighteen new records.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th: The four major coal mines in Liaoning Province, Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao, have overfulfilled the raw coal production plan for the first half of January one day ahead of schedule. According to statistics from the 1st to the 14th, the four major coal mines increased raw coal production by more than 140,000 tons compared to the plan.

On New Year's Day, these four major coal mines overfulfilled the production plan. Workers were enthusiastic and launched the "Five Goods" competition of "Good attendance, good production, good quality, good safety, and good discipline." Leading cadres of each mine, starting from New Year's Day, went to the forefront of production to lead workers in carrying out technical performance competitions and promoting experiences such as "four-eight cross-operation."

Now, the workers of the four major coal mines are working harder, determined to prepare in all aspects and strive to complete the January raw coal production plan three days ahead of schedule to ensure a flying start for Spring Festival production.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th: The workers of the three major coal mines in Heilongjiang Province, Hegang, Jixi, and Shuangyashan, overfulfilled the raw coal production plan for the first half of January by 4.8%, and also overfulfilled the main roadway excavation plan by 3.5%.

In the past half month, various coal mines have deeply mobilized the masses, vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, and vigorously promoted advanced experience, so that production efficiency has been continuously improved. These three mines have all formulated plans for technical innovation and promotion of advanced experience, and have specifically implemented them in various mines and teams in conjunction with the discussion of production plans. Subsequently, they launched a competition to compare with advanced, learn from advanced, catch up with advanced, and help the backward. All coal mines have actively promoted the "four-eight cross-operation" and the eight advanced experiences exchanged by the national coal mine observation group, focusing on coal mining and tunneling.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th: On the basis of achieving a good start and a successful first ten days, Shenyang's machinery manufacturing industry has also completed the production tasks for the first half of January very well. The average daily output value from January 1st to 14th increased by 19.8% compared with the average daily output value in December last year; the main products produced, such as machine tools, flotation machines, fans, water pumps, diesel engines, and tractors, reached 2,936 units.

Entering the new year, the workers of Shenyang's machinery industry immediately launched a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization. In just eight days, the city's sixty-four machinery manufacturing factories put forward 2,758 technical innovation proposals, of which 1,539 have been implemented. These innovations have powerfully guaranteed the early completion of the plan for the first half of the month.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th: Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and Xishan Mining Bureau are actively strengthening preparations to ensure a flying start for Spring Festival production and to guarantee a full house in January.
