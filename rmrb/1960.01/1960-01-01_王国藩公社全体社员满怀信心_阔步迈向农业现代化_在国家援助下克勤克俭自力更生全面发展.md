    The Kingdom Fan Commune's Entire Membership, Full of Confidence, Strides Towards Agricultural Modernization
    Develop Comprehensively with Diligence, Frugality, and Self-Reliance Under National Assistance

    (Our report) The Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, under the leadership of Commune Chief Wang Guofan, is further promoting the style of diligence and frugality, and advancing towards agricultural modernization.

    In the past year, the Jianming People's Commune inherited and promoted the tradition of running the commune diligently and frugally, relying on the strength of the large collective to achieve simultaneous leaps forward in all five sectors and a comprehensive bumper harvest. In 1959, the average grain yield per mu in the commune was 650 jin, an increase of 33% compared to 1958. After overfulfilling the grain procurement task, the commune still had 490,000 jin of reserve grain. The total agricultural income reached 2,318,000 yuan, an increase of 44.1% compared to 1958. Animal husbandry also developed significantly. The number of cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses increased from 1,958 in 1958 to 2,548. The number of sheep increased from 5,100 in 1958 to more than 9,100. Pig breeding developed the fastest, from 12,400 at the end of 1958 to 21,000 now, achieving one pig per person. With more livestock and pigs, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu also increased from 7,000 jin in the past to 10,000 jin. In the past year, the commune used its public accumulation to purchase four tractors, eleven agricultural implements, sixteen power machines, and five generators. In the spring of 1959, they used the method of "going to the mountains to get it," mobilizing cadres and members to collect 200 jin of firewood per person, selling it for more than 30,000 yuan, and buying two cars. In 1959, the total income from forestry and fruit amounted to more than 440,000 yuan, an increase of 30.69% compared to 1958. Sideline occupations, fishery, and industry also had considerable growth. The total income from all sources increased by 29.6% compared to 1958. The average income per person in the commune was 112.8 yuan, an increase of 16.3% compared to 1958. Eight of the original eleven poor teams caught up with the income level of the rich teams.

    After achieving great results, the cadres and members of the Jianming Commune were not complacent. To strive for continued leaps forward in 1960, they are vigorously engaged in water conservancy construction and have put forward the slogan "Work hard for 100 days to realize agricultural modernization." According to the plan for agricultural modernization, the Jianming Commune will build a water irrigation network in the plains and cover the mountains with contour canals, so that more than 90% of the commune's land can ensure a good harvest in drought and flood conditions. Agricultural machinery will be used for the main farming operations on 70% of the land. All irrigation water lifting will be replaced by machinery or electricity instead of human and animal power, and transportation will be motorized and rubber-wheeled. On the basis of increasing the application of crude fertilizer, a chemical fertilizer plant with an annual output of 800 tons of synthetic ammonia will be built in 1960, and chemical fertilizers will be gradually increased. A 70-kilometer high-voltage line will be erected to draw electricity from Tangshan City, so that the commune's water conservancy, industry, and other sectors can be powered by electricity.

    At present, all cadres and members of the Jianming Commune are full of confidence and are vigorously engaged in agricultural modernization. Hebei Province has decided to help them solve all the required machinery, totaling a loan equivalent to 3.5 million yuan, stipulating that it be repaid in three to five years. However, the Jianming Commune Party Committee put forward the slogan of "Striving to repay the state advance payment within one year." To achieve this, the specific method is: take out 300,000 yuan from the 1959 public accumulation as funds for realizing modernization; mobilize commune members to save and invest 280,000 yuan; and vigorously develop diversified operations to increase income. Comrade Wang Guofan said confidently that as long as the policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery is resolutely implemented, sufficient funds can be obtained in 1960. The specific plan of the Jianming Commune is: in 1960, obtain 1.2 million yuan from cutting pit props; fruit income of 600,000 yuan; sell 20,000 fat pigs, income of 700,000 yuan; in addition, develop sheep and fishery, firewood, and dig medicinal materials, etc., can earn 970,000 yuan, the above total income of more than 3.4 million yuan. In 1960, the per-mu yield targets for the commune's crops are: 1,200 jin of grain, 400 jin of peanuts, and 100 jin of cotton (lint). In this way, the total annual agricultural income is about 2 million yuan, plus the income from diversified operations, the total income this year can reach about 8 million yuan. In this way, their plan to strive to repay the state loan within one year is likely to be realized. Their spirit of thinking for the country and other communes is very valuable. This can not only greatly promote the development of the commune's diversified economy, but also provide the country with more agricultural products.

    Now, a movement centered on water conservancy construction has taken shape. The whole commune is concentrating its main labor force on rushing to build three contour canals. The commune members working on the construction site are full of energy.

    王国藩公社全体社员满怀信心
    阔步迈向农业现代化
    在国家援助下克勤克俭自力更生全面发展
    本报讯　河北遵化县建明人民公社，在社长王国藩的领导下，更加发扬克勤克俭作风，大步向农业现代化前进。
    建明人民公社一年来，继承和发扬了勤俭办社的传统，依靠大集体的力量，做到了五业齐跃进，全面大丰收。1959年全社粮食平均亩产六百五十斤，比1958年提高33％，除超额完成了粮食征购任务外，全社还有四十九万斤储备粮。农业总收入达到二百三十一万八千元，比1958年增加了44．1％。畜牧业也有很大的发展，牛、驴、骡、马由1958年的一千九百五十八头增加到了二千五百四十八头。羊由1958年的五千一百只，增加到了九千一百多只；猪只发展最快，1958年年底有一万二千四百头，现在已经增加到两万一千头，达到了一人一头猪。牲口多了，猪多了，每亩地施肥量也由过去的七千斤增加到一万斤。一年来，用公社的公共积累，购买了四台拖拉机、十一台农业机具、十六台动力机械、五台发电机。1959年春天，他们又用“到山上去取”的办法，发动全社干部和社员每人打柴二百斤，卖了三万多元，买了两辆汽车。1959年林果收入总计四十四万多元，比1958年增长30．69％。副业、渔业、工业也都有不小增长。各项收入总起来比1958年增长29．6％。全社平均每人收入一百一十二元八角，比1958年增长了16．3％。原有的十一个穷队，其中八个队赶上了富队的收入水平。
    在取得了巨大成绩之后，建明公社干部和社员并没有因此自满。他们为争取1960年继续跃进，正在大搞水利建设，并提出“大干一百天，实现农业现代化”的口号。按照农业现代化的规划，建明公社要在平原地区建成水利灌溉网，山地要遍布盘山渠，使全社90％以上的土地在旱、涝情况下保丰收；在70％的土地上主要农活用机械操作，所有农田灌溉的提水部分都用机械或电力代替人、畜力，实现运输汽车化、胶轮化；在增施粗肥的基础上，1960年建成一座年产八百吨合成氨的化肥厂，逐步增施化肥；架设七十公里的高压线，引用唐山市的电力，使公社水利、工业等做到以电力为动力。
    目前，建明公社全体干部和社员个个满怀信心，大搞农业现代化。河北省已决定帮助他们解决所需要的全部机器，共折合贷款三百五十万元，规定三、五年还清；但是建明公社党委提出了“争取一年内还清国家垫款”的口号。要做到这一点，具体办法是：从1959年的公共积累中拿出三十万元作为实现现代化的资金；发动社员储蓄和投资二十八万元；同时大力发展多种经营增加收入。王国藩同志有信心地说，只要坚决贯彻农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展的方针，1960年内可以拿到足够的资金。建明公社的具体计划是：1960年从砍伐坑木取得一百二十万元；果品收入六十万元；卖肥猪两万头，收入七十万元；另外发展羊和渔业、打柴、挖药材等，可以收入九十七万元，以上合计收入三百四十多万元。1960年全社农作物亩产指标是：粮食一千二百斤，花生四百斤，棉花（皮棉）一百斤。这样全年农业收入折款二百万元左右，加上多种经营的收入，总计今年总收入可达到八百万元左右。这样看来，他们争取一年之内还清国家贷款的计划，是有可能实现的。他们这种为国家、为其他公社着想的精神非常可贵。这样不仅可以大大推动本社多种经济的发展，同时又可以为国家提供更多的农产品。
    现在，一个以修水利为中心的运动已经形成。全社正集中主要劳动力，突击修建三条盘山大渠，在工地上劳动的社员们个个干劲十足。
