From Penglai Town, heading south for two li, you arrive at Five Phoenix Mountain. The No. 1 Respect for the Aged Home of the Red Flag People's Commune in Pengxi County, Sichuan Province, is located in the Chunyang Temple, nestled deep in the woods on the mountaintop. Five Phoenix Mountain is a place of beautiful scenery. On the walls, predecessors wrote: "Penglai Fairyland," "The First Grotto Heaven."

The No. 2 Respect for the Aged Home is on East Street in Penglai Town. Behind this newly renovated bungalow with red walls and green windows is the Qi River. On the left bank, reeds are in full bloom, and on the right bank, banyan trees provide shade. Small bridges and green waves create a pleasant scene.

The Red Flag People's Commune has established a total of nine Respect for the Aged Homes, accommodating one hundred and ninety-eight elderly people, thirty-nine of whom live in the two Respect for the Aged Homes we visited. Before liberation, these elderly people were helpless, widowed, orphaned, and childless individuals who had always received relief from the People's Government and were "Five Guarantees" households, ensuring food, clothing, fuel, education, and burial by the agricultural cooperatives. Now, the name has changed, and people call them "Happy Elderly."

Calling them Happy Elderly is most appropriate. Take the day we visited the No. 1 Respect for the Aged Home as an example. Upon entering the courtyard, we saw several elderly people surrounded by a pile of chili peppers, picking them while laughing and chatting animatedly. Seeing us arrive, they enthusiastically led us to the reception room to sit down. This reception room was spacious, with a row of lounge chairs in the middle, a desk on the side, various colorful pictures on the walls, and a phonograph placed against the wall.

In this reception room, the elderly people introduced us to their happy lives in their later years, praising everything from clothing and food to medical care and daily life. Living such a happy life today, the elderly people naturally thought of the past. Li Jiacai, an old man from the No. 2 Respect for the Aged Home, said: "Ten years ago, I thought I would end up in the Martial Saint Temple or the City God Temple in my old age. I never dreamed that I would have such a good place to live today." He is over sixty years old this year. In the thirty-nine years before liberation, he spent his nights in a corner on the upper floor of a slaughterhouse. He now shares a spacious bedroom with Tang Guangwu, another old man. He said that before liberation, the Martial Saint Temple and the City God Temple were places that made orphaned and widowed elderly people's hearts ache. So many helpless elderly people could not find a place to settle down and ended their miserable later years there! An old man named He Laomo died at the foot of the stage in the Martial Saint Temple, and his body was only discovered when it was covered in maggots.

Li Jiacai enthusiastically led us to visit all the dormitories in the home. The elderly people live in rooms with two or three people, so they don't feel lonely and can take care of each other in their daily lives. Chen Shiyu and Deng Maoxiu are an old couple who live in a single room. Each old person's bed has a new white mosquito net, a new floral sheet, a new floral pillow, and a new quilt with a red cover. The night the new quilts were distributed the year before last winter, many elderly people were so excited that they couldn't sleep. On this touching evening, seventy-seven-year-old Granny Cha Qingxi, remembering that she had no quilt since she became a child bride in the Tang family at the age of ten, and used cogon grass on her body at night for thirty-five years, was moved to tears with a mixture of bitterness and happiness.

In the old society, people relied on their sons and daughters. The elderly people in the Respect for the Aged Homes had spent most of their lives worrying about their children, but most of them had no children to rely on, and the few who had children couldn't rely on them either. When this matter was mentioned, each old person had a history of bitterness and tears. Of the fifteen elderly people in the No. 1 Respect for the Aged Home, nine had never married. Eight of these nine people had been helping others since they were about ten years old. In the old society, who would be willing to marry a longtime bachelor? Old Man Jiang Xingfa said: "Not to mention that others wouldn't marry you, even if someone was willing to marry, I couldn't afford to take her!" Some people were lucky enough to marry and start a family, but some sold their children because they couldn't afford to raise them, some starved to death or froze to death, some were drafted by the reactionaries and never heard from again, some were forced to leave home due to life and never returned, and some were forced to death by rent and usury. Liu Changxiu, from the No. 1 Respect for the Aged Home, had his third son taken away for ten strings of cash and two catties of pork when he was only half a year old.

Comrade Cai Xiangyuan, the director of the No. 1 Respect for the Aged Home, said: "In the agricultural cooperative, although the state and the agricultural cooperative spent a lot of money and energy to take care of them, their difficulties could not be completely solved. Only with the People's Commune can the problems of the widowed, orphaned, and childless be completely solved." He used to be the director of the first branch of the Five Phoenix Agricultural Cooperative. In the agricultural cooperative he led, there were five "Five Guarantees" households among the seventy-two members, all of whom lived scattered, and the cooperative could only ask neighboring members to take care of them, and it was impossible to send someone to guard them. At that time, the cooperative also thought about running welfare undertakings such as Respect for the Aged Homes, but the cooperative was small and weak and could not do it.

After the establishment of the Red Flag People's Commune, the conditions and strength for running collective welfare undertakings were greater than those of the advanced cooperative. On the third day after the establishment of the commune, the No. 1 Respect for the Aged Home was established, followed by the No. 2 Respect for the Aged Home. The commune party committee attached great importance to running the Respect for the Aged Homes. In addition to sending strong cadres to work in the Respect for the Aged Homes, they also transferred a Young Communist League member with good ideology and strong labor power to the No. 1 Respect for the Aged Home as a cook. The commune members were also very enthusiastic about running the Respect for the Aged Homes and respected the elderly very much. The young commune members of the tenth district team of the Gujing District Brigade spent an afternoon repairing a large road in and out of the No. 1 Respect for the Aged Home. Many commune members also often went to the home to visit familiar elderly people.

The commune originally wanted those helpless elderly people to live a leisurely life in the Respect for the Aged Homes. However, these elderly people who had worked all their lives were not used to being idle. If they didn't touch any work, they felt like they had lost something. They repeatedly asked the commune to give them some work to do. According to the wishes and labor capacity of the elderly people, the Respect for the Aged Home bought some chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, pigs, sheep, etc. for them to raise; cut some bamboo for the elderly people with skills to weave bamboo ware; and allocated more than one mu of land to grow vegetables. The elderly people participated in whatever kind of production they liked and did as much as they wanted. However, the elderly people's enthusiasm for labor was very high, and they always wanted to do more work. In this way, it not only reduced the burden on the commune, but also found the joy of life for the elderly people.

The elderly people's moods have all changed, and they all feel that they are getting younger and younger. Li Jiacai said: "Living a comfortable and happy life in the Respect for the Aged Home, my hanging heart has finally settled down!" They used to rely on their sons and daughters, but now they feel that "the Communist Party is more亲 than parents" and "the People's Commune is more reliable than children." They said: "Happiness flowers bloom, happiness comes, lonely old people are happy, there are Respect for the Aged Homes in the world, and even longevity stars want to descend to earth." They are no longer concerned about whether they have children and the issue of birth, old age, sickness, and death, but about national affairs and socialist construction. When the production team where the No. 1 Respect for the Aged Home is located sows cotton in the spring, the elderly people automatically go to help dig holes and plant seedlings. When young people are planting high-yield cotton fields, they often take the initiative to offer suggestions and impart technology. When there is a drought, the elderly people's moods are as tense as the commune members. When there is a good harvest, the elderly people are as happy as the commune members. The elderly people's love for today's life, their love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and their love for the People's Commune is endless. Liu Lizhen said: "Every day when I pick up my rice bowl, put on my clothes, see the mosquito net, and cover myself with the quilt, I think of Chairman Mao's kindness. At night, I dream of Chairman Mao smiling and shining golden light on the Respect for the Aged Home." (Originally published in the Sichuan Daily)

    蓬莱仙境在人间
    洪奇
    出蓬莱镇南行二里路便到五凤山，四川省蓬溪县红旗人民公社第一敬老院就在山顶林荫深处的纯阳祠内。五凤山是个风景幽美的地方，前人在墙上写着：“蓬莱仙境”、“第一洞天”。
    第二敬老院在蓬莱镇东街上。这座培修得焕然一新、红墙绿窗的平房后面，便是郪江，江左芦花满岸，江右榕树成荫，小桥绿波，景色宜人。
    红旗人民公社共办了九个敬老院，接纳了一百九十八名老人，其中的三十九名就住在我们访问的两个敬老院中。这些老人，解放前是无依无靠的鳏寡孤独，解放后是一直受到了人民政府的救济，和由农业社保吃、保穿、保烧、保教、保葬的“五保”户。现在名称变了，人们称呼他们是“幸福老人”。
    用幸福老人来称呼他们是最恰当不过的了。就说我们到第一敬老院的那天吧，走进院里，看见几个老人围着一堆海椒，一面摘海椒，一面哈笑连天地摆龙门阵。见我们去了，热情地领我们到客堂里去坐。这间客堂，房屋宽敞，中间是一排躺椅，旁边有一张书桌，墙上贴着各种彩画，墙边还放着一部留声机。
    在这间客堂里，老人们给我们介绍了他们晚年的幸福生活，从穿衣吃饭到医药起居，都是说一样夸一样。过着今天的幸福生活，老人们就自然地想起从前来了。第二敬老院的李家才老汉说：“十年前，我还以为老来要进武圣宫和城隍庙呢，做梦也没有想到今天有这样好的地方住。”他今年六十多了，解放前的三十九年中，都是在一家屠宰场楼上的角角上过夜。他现在和唐光武老汉住着一间宽敞的寝室。他说武圣宫和城隍庙，解放前是叫孤寡老人们寒心的地方。多少无依无靠的老人，找不到安身之处，到哪里去结束了悲惨的晚年！有个老头何老么，死在武圣宫戏楼脚下，周身长满了蛆才被人发现。
    李家才老汉兴致勃勃地领着我们参观了全院的宿舍，老人们是两个或三个人住一间寝室，这样，一来不感寂寞，二来好在生活上互相照顾。陈士雨和邓茂秀是对老夫妻，就单住一间房子。每个老人的床上，都挂着新的白蚊帐，垫着新的花卧单，放着新的花枕头和一床红被面的新被盖。前年冬天，发新被盖的晚上，许多老人兴奋得睡不着觉。在这动人心弦的晚上，七十七岁的查清秀老大娘，想起十岁到唐家当童养媳起就无被盖，冬天夜里，用山茅草搭在身上，盖了三十五年，辛酸和幸福交织在一起，感动得哭了一场。
    在旧社会，人们是靠儿靠女。敬老院中的老人们，过去为儿女悬心吊胆地过了大半辈子，结果是多数人无儿女可靠，少数有儿女的也没有靠住。提起这件事，每个老人都有一部辛酸血泪史。第一敬老院的十五个老人，有九个没有结过婚。这九个人中有八个人从十岁左右起就帮人。在旧社会，哪个愿把姑娘嫁给长年大哥？姜兴发老汉说：“莫说别人不会嫁给你，就是有人肯嫁，自己也无力接呀！”有的人也侥幸娶亲成家，生了儿女，但有的生下来因无力抚养就卖给别人了，有的饿死冻死了，有的被反动派拉丁拉夫一去永无音信，有的为生活逼走他方一去未归，有的被地租、高利贷逼死了。第一敬老院的刘昌秀，生下第三个儿子才半岁就被别人拿十吊钱搭两斤猪肉换去了。
    第一敬老院院长蔡祥源同志说：“在农业社时，虽然国家和农业社花了许多钱和精力来照顾他们，但是还不能彻底解决他们的困难，只有到了人民公社，才把鳏寡孤独的问题彻底解决了。”他过去是五凤农业社一分社的主任，他领导的那个农业社，七十二户社员中有“五保”户五户，都分散住着，社里只有叫邻近的社员照看他们，不可能派专人守护。当时社里也想着办敬老院这类福利事业，但社小力量小搞不起来。
    红旗人民公社成立后，办集体福利事业的条件、力量都比高级社更多更大了，在公社成立的第三天，第一敬老院便办起来，接着又办起第二敬老院。公社党委十分重视办敬老院，除派很强的干部做敬老院工作外，还调了个思想好、劳力强的共青团员到第一敬老院当炊事员。社员对办敬老院也很热心，十分尊敬老年人。古井区联队第十区队的青年社员，一个下午便给第一敬老院修好一条进出的大路。许多社员还常到院中看望熟识的老人。
    公社本来是要那些无依无靠的老人，到敬老院中过清闲日子。可是这些劳动了一生的老人却闲不惯，手上不摸点活路，就像丢了什么东西一样，再三要求公社给他们一点活路做。敬老院根据老人们的心愿和劳力情况，买了些鸡、鸭、鹅、兔、猪、羊等给他们饲养；砍了些竹子给有技术的老人编篾货；划了一亩多地来种蔬菜。老人们喜欢干那种活就参加那种生产，高兴做多少就做多少。但是老人们的劳动热情很高，总想多干点活路。这样，既为公社减轻了负担，又为老人们找到了生活的乐趣。
    老人们的心情全变了，都感到越活越年轻了。李家才老汉说：“在敬老院里过着舒服愉快的生活，我这颗悬吊吊的心一下子就落下去了！”他们过去是靠儿靠女，现在则感到“共产党比爹娘还要亲”，“人民公社比儿女更可靠。”他们说：“幸福花开幸福来，孤寡老人喜心怀，人间有了敬老院，寿星也想下凡来。”他们关心的不再是自己有无儿女和生老病死问题，而是国家大事和社会主义建设了。第一敬老院所在的生产队，春天播种棉花时，老人们便自动去帮助打窝、栽苗。青年们在种棉花高产田，他们便经常主动地去献计策传授技术。天旱了，老人们的心情也跟社员一样紧张。丰收了，老人们跟社员一样的欢乐。老人们热爱今天的生活，热爱党和毛主席，热爱人民公社的心情，是说不完的。刘礼珍说：“我每天端起饭碗，穿上衣服，看到蚊帐，盖上被盖，就想起毛主席的恩情，晚上做梦也梦见毛主席笑容满面，金光闪闪地照亮了敬老院。”　（原载四川日报）
