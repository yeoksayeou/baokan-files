    German Philosophers Gather
    To Discuss Problems of Historical Materialism
    According to a report in the Soviet "Problems of Philosophy," a scientific conference commemorating the 50th anniversary of the publication of Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" was recently held in Berlin. This conference was organized by the Philosophy Teaching and Research Office of the Institute of Social Sciences, directly under the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, and mainly discussed issues of historical materialism.
    At the meeting, Professor Hermann Scheler gave a report entitled "The Significance of Lenin's 'Materialism and Empirio-criticism' for the Development of Historical Materialism." He analyzed and criticized the anti-Marxist-Leninist theoretical attempts of the revisionists. In his report, Scheler talked about the current tasks of philosophers in the German Democratic Republic. He pointed out that Lenin's work remains a significant theoretical weapon for accomplishing these tasks.
    During the discussion, many theoretical issues were explored. The main ones included: the formation of the socialist consciousness of the working people of the German Democratic Republic; the realistic content of the problems of theory and practice in the context of the German Democratic Republic; the criticism of modern bourgeois and reformist philosophy; and so on. In addition, the philosophical problems of natural science were discussed, the problems of the history of philosophy were studied, and the influence of "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" on the development of ideological struggle and the formation of the new type of party in Germany was elucidated, among other things.
    In the discussion, some issues aroused heated debate. For example, regarding the conceptual issue of social existence and social consciousness, Scheler criticized the views of Tugarinov in an essay published in "Problems of Philosophy." He said that, according to Tugarinov's view, what determines our consciousness is not only matter, the material world, but also spirit and ideas. This equates social existence with social consciousness, resulting in Bogdanov's argument. Many participants supported this criticism. However, some people opposed this criticism, believing that the relationships and organizations of politics, law, and religion cannot be regarded merely as ideological phenomena.
    Professor Kurt Hager gave a summary at the end of the meeting. He pointed out that Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" is a model of a Marxist approach to philosophy. He also clarified some basic tasks for philosophers in the German Democratic Republic, namely, to study the problems of socialist cooperation in production, the problems of correct leadership and organization of labor under the socialist system, the problems of class struggle in the German Democratic Republic, the problems of peace and unification, and so on.

    德哲学家集会
    讨论历史唯物主义问题
    据苏联“哲学问题”报道，不久前在柏林举行了纪念列宁的“唯物主义和经验批判主义”出版五十周年的科学会议。这次会议是德国统一社会党中央委员会直属社会科学研究所哲学教研室组织的，主要是讨论历史唯物主义问题。
    在会上，海尔曼·谢勒尔教授作了“列宁的‘唯物主义和经验批判主义’对发展历史唯物主义的意义”的报告。他分析和批判了修正主义者反马克思列宁主义的理论上的企图。谢勒尔在报告中谈到德意志民主共和国哲学家的当前任务。他指出列宁的著作对于完成这些任务仍然是重大的理论武器。
    在讨论会上，探讨了不少理论问题。其中主要的有：德意志民主共和国劳动人民的社会主义意识的形成；关于理论和实践问题在德意志民主共和国情况下的现实内容；对现代资产阶级和改良主义哲学的批判，等等。此外，还讨论了自然科学的哲学问题，研究了哲学史的问题，以及阐述了“唯物主义和经验批判主义”对思想斗争的发展和德国新型的党的形成的影响，等等。
    在讨论中，有一些问题引起了热烈的争论。例如，关于社会存在和社会意识的概念问题，谢勒尔在报告中批评了图加林诺夫在“哲学问题”上发表的一篇论文的观点。他说，按照图加林诺夫的观点，决定我们意识的存在不仅是物质、物质世界，而且还有精神、观念。这便把社会存在和社会意识等同起来，结果就成了波格丹诺夫的论点。与会的许多人支持这种批评。但是，也有一些人反对这种批评，认为不能把政治、法律、宗教等的关系和组织看作仅仅是意识形态现象。
    库尔特·哈格尔教授在会议最后作了总结。他指出列宁的“唯物主义和经验批判主义”是马克思主义地对待哲学的典范。他还阐明了德意志民主共和国哲学家的一些基本任务，即研究关于生产中的社会主义的合作问题，关于在社会主义制度下正确领导和组织劳动的问题，关于德意志民主共和国的阶级斗争的问题，关于和约和统一的问题，等等。
