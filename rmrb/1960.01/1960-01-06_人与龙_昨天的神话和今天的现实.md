　　Many vibrant "good start" messages have been published in the newspaper. Many production departments are carrying out "one-dragon" collaborations and competitions in order to seize the opening red. This new socialist labor competition has improved labor efficiency, and production records have been refreshed. From this "one-dragon," I thought of many allusions about the dragon.

　　When the legend of the dragon began is difficult to verify. The earliest record is in the "Li Yun Pian" of the "Book of Rites" in the Spring and Autumn Period: "The unicorn, phoenix, tortoise, and dragon are called the four spirits." Liu Yuxi of the Tang Dynasty wrote in "Simple Room Inscription": "Mountains are famous because of immortals; waters are spiritual because of dragons." In the minds of ancient people, the dragon was a spiritual creature and an auspicious omen. The dragon in Chinese mythology can be transformed into a human, and people and dragons are almost integrated and can be transformed into each other. In many myths and legends, dragons are like humans, with love, offspring, raising children, and living in dragon palaces. The King of Dragons can also "cause clouds and rain, and order all living beings." When I was a child in my hometown, I saw farmers dancing the water dragon to pray for rain, which was probably based on this legend.

　　In the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," in the episode of Cao Cao boiling wine to discuss heroes, there is a wonderful description of the dragon:

　　When the wine was half drunk, suddenly dark clouds were thick and heavy rain was about to come. The attendants pointed to the dragon hanging far away in the sky, and Cao Cao and Xuan De leaned on the railing to watch. Cao Cao said, "Does the lord know the changes of the dragon?" Xuan De said, "I don't know the details." Cao Cao said: "The dragon can be big or small, can be hidden or ascended. When it is big, it can stir up clouds and fog; when it is small, it can hide its shape. When it ascends, it can fly in the universe; when it hides, it can lurk in the waves. Now that spring is deep, the dragon takes advantage of the time to change, just like a person who is successful and roams the world. The dragon can be compared to the heroes of the world..."

　　This widely known text vividly describes the image of the dragon, as if it is flying on paper.

　　However, these are just illusory images and legends. In actual life, there has never been a dragon as seen in the current paintings. Although the emergence of the dragon only represents the beautiful fantasy of people conquering nature under the extremely low productivity of ancient times, the legendary dragon is a concentrated reflection of the infinite wisdom, great power, and strong will of the working people. The dragon can swallow clouds and spit fog, roam the world, cause clouds and rain, benefit all things, and no power can resist it.

　　Now the world has changed. The working people are liberated and have turned over. This dragon has also been liberated from the Dragon Palace and flown to the world. Let's talk about the "one-dragon" collaboration: Dalian Railway Department and Dalian Seaport carried out "one-dragon" collaboration, and established a "ten unified" system including ideology, leadership, dispatch, planning, and shift competition, which greatly improved transportation efficiency. Jinan City also carried out "one-dragon" collaboration competition between industry, commerce, and banks. It organized the supply, sales, and bank collaboration in hardware machinery, textile printing and dyeing, transportation electrical equipment, daily necessities, etc., enabling many units to quickly overcome difficulties and a situation of booming production and sales emerged.

　　However, is it just "one-dragon" collaboration? Our entire socialist cause, our heroic 600 million people, is also a golden giant dragon, soaring through the sky, "stirring up clouds and spitting fog," "flying in the universe" and "roaming the world." Isn't the leap forward speed of our socialist construction cause like a giant dragon taking off a thousand miles a day? Isn't the high-spirited fighting spirit of our 600 million people like the dragon's roar, traversing the universe? Doesn't the communist style and heroic image of the Chinese people far surpass the dragon-like heroes discussed by Cao Cao? The great new China, standing majestically in the world, has long been called the golden dragon by the West.

　　Our era is an era of spring breeze and rain. We congratulate this dragon on forever flying in the universe and roaming the world!

### 人与龙——昨天的神话和今天的现实

    人与龙——昨天的神话和今天的现实
    钟欣泰
    报上发表了许多蓬蓬勃勃的“开门红”的消息。有许多生产部门，为了巧夺开门红，开展着“一条龙”大协作竞赛。这种新的社会主义劳动竞赛，提高了劳动效率，生产纪录为之一新。从这“一条龙”，我想起了许多关于龙的掌故。
    龙的传说起于何时，殊难稽考。最早见于春秋“礼记”的“礼运篇”：“麟凤龟龙，谓之四灵。”唐刘禹锡“陋室铭”有句云：“山不在高，有仙则名；水不在深，有龙则灵”。龙在古代人们的心目中，是有灵气的神物，是吉祥的兆征。中国神话里的龙，是可以变成人的，人与龙几乎合为一体，可以互相转化。在许多神话和传说里，龙都是和人一样，有爱情，有后嗣，养儿女，居龙宫。龙中之王，还可以“兴云布雨，令诸众生。”小时在故乡，见农民舞水龙求雨，大约就是根据这传说。
    三国演义的曹操煮酒论英雄一回里，有一段关于龙的精彩的描述：
    酒至半酣，忽阴云漠漠，骤雨将至。从人遥指天外龙挂，操与玄德凭栏观之。操曰：“使君知龙之变化否？”玄德曰：“未知其详。”操曰：“龙能大能小，能隐能升。大则兴云吐雾，小则隐介藏形，升则飞腾于宇宙之间，隐则潜伏于波涛之内。方今春深，龙乘时变化，犹人得志而纵横四海。龙之为物，可比世之英雄……。”
    这一段脍炙人口的文字，把龙的形象描写得活灵活现，如飞纸上。
    然而这些都不过是虚幻的假象和传说而已，在实际生活中，并不曾有过现在画上所见的龙。龙的产生，虽然只不过是代表了古代生产力极低的条件下，人们对征服自然的美丽的幻想。但传说中的龙，却是劳动人民无穷的智慧，伟大的力量和坚强的意志的集中的体现。龙可以吞云吐雾，纵横四海，兴云雨，利万物，没有任何力量可以与之抗衡。
    如今换了人间。劳动人民解放了，翻身了。这龙，也从龙宫解放出来、飞到人间来了。就说“一条龙”大协作吧：大连铁路部门和大连海港开展“一条龙”大协作，建立了思想、领导、调度、计划、班次竞赛等“十统一”制度，大大提高了运输效率。济南市工业、商业和银行之间也开展了“一条龙”大协作竞赛。组织了五金机械，纺织印染，交通电工器材，日用百货等方面的供、销、银行大协作，使许多单位迅速克服了困难，出现了生产、购销业务蒸蒸日上的局面。
    然而，又岂仅仅是“一条龙”大协作而已？我们整个社会主义事业，我们英雄的六亿人民，也正是一条金光闪闪的巨龙，翱翔九霄，“兴云吐雾”，“飞腾于宇宙之间”而“纵横四海”了。我们社会主义建设事业的跃进速度，岂不正像巨龙腾跃一日千里；我们六亿人的昂扬斗志，岂不正像巨龙的叱咤风云，纵横寰宇；我们中国人民的共产主义风格和英雄形象岂仅远远超过了曹操所论的巨龙式的英雄。巍然屹立于世界的伟大新中国，是早被西方称为金色巨龙的了。
    我们的时代是春风化雨的时代，我们祝贺这条龙永远飞翔宇宙、纵横四海！
