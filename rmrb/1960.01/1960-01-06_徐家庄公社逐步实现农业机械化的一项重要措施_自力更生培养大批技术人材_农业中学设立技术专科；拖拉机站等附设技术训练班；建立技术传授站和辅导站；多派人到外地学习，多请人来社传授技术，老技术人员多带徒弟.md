    An Important Measure for Xujiazhuang Commune to Gradually Achieve Agricultural Mechanization
    Relying on Our Own Efforts to Train a Large Number of Technical Talents
    Agricultural Middle School Establishes Technical Specializations; Tractor Stations, etc., Attach Technical Training Classes; Establish Technical Instruction Stations and Guidance Stations; Send More People to Other Places to Study, Invite More People to the Commune to Teach Technology, and Old Technicians Take on More Apprentices
    (By Our Newspaper) The Xujiazhuang People's Commune in Hengshui County, Hebei Province, is vigorously running technical education by relying on its own efforts. Cadres are taking the lead in learning production technology, actively preparing technical forces to achieve agricultural modernization.
    Achieving agricultural modernization requires a large number of agricultural technicians. Where do these technical forces come from? In the Xujiazhuang People's Commune, there were two opinions. Some cadres and commune members advocated asking the state for personnel, while others advocated training them ourselves. The commune Party committee mobilized all cadres and commune members to launch a "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" debate on this issue. The result of the discussion was that we cannot simply rely on the state and should train them ourselves. In 1958, the Xujiazhuang Production Team bought 19 sets of irrigation and drainage machinery. The team held a technical training class and trained 25 mechanics in two months. The Zhanghuai Production Team bought more than a dozen sets of irrigation and drainage machinery, but waited for the county to allocate technical personnel, which resulted in most of the irrigation and drainage machinery not being started, affecting production. These facts strengthened the confidence of the vast number of commune members and cadres in training technical talents through self-reliance.
    In the process of training technical talents, this commune adopted the methods of "one school," "three trainings," "two stations," and "three mores." "One school" refers to establishing an agricultural middle school. In the autumn of 1958, the commune established an agricultural middle school with six departments, including machinery, chemistry, electricity, and water conservancy, with a total of more than 530 students. In one year, this school trained 60 irrigation and drainage mechanics, 20 tractor drivers and car drivers, and 20 electrical technicians for the commune. "Three trainings" refers to the tractor station, motor vehicle team, and machinery station of the commune, which respectively attached short-term technical training classes. Old technicians served as instructors, and each session was trained every month. From late July 1959 to the end of the year, more than 260 technicians have been trained. "Two stations" refers to the establishment of technical instruction stations and guidance stations. Five management areas in the commune established technical instruction stations, absorbing cadres, team leaders, and technical backbones from each team every ten days to listen to the technical guidance team of the management area to impart technology. The task of the guidance station is to help technicians in each team solve technical difficulties in production. Twelve technicians were drawn from the commune's tractor station and machinery station to organize a guidance team, which went to each production team on a regular basis to help solve technical problems in production. "Three mores" means sending more commune members to learn technology in various places; inviting more technicians from all fields to come to the commune to teach technology; and old technicians taking on more apprentices. Not long ago, the commune sent more than 70 commune members to the Hengshui County Machinery Training Class, Tianjin Chemical Engineering Institute, and Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory to study; it also invited old technicians from Hengshui Power Plant and Hengshui Machinery Factory to come to the commune to teach machinery and electrical technology; the old technical workers who started irrigation and drainage machinery, tractors, and cars were assigned the task of taking apprentices, and the system of guaranteed teaching and learning was implemented. Tractor drivers Yang Wen and Jiang Wensen trained more than 30 tractor drivers in half a year.
    The commune Party committee and Party organizations at all levels attach great importance to technical education. The commune established a technical guidance committee, led by the first secretary Liu Licun himself; the management area and production team also established a technical guidance team, mainly led by the branch secretary. The commune also drew three Party committee members and twelve cadres to serve as principals and class leaders in agricultural middle schools and tractor, automobile, and irrigation and drainage machinery training classes; cadres of the commune and production teams also took the lead in learning and mastering technology. Liu Licun, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, lived in the machinery station at night and learned technology from technicians whenever he had time. Now he has learned to drive tractors, irrigation and drainage machinery, and cars. Lü Bingju, deputy secretary of the commune Party committee, went to the technical training class every night to listen to lectures. According to incomplete statistics, more than 120 cadres above the rank of captain in the entire commune have learned the techniques of driving tractors, automobiles, and irrigation and drainage machinery. Cadres learning and mastering technology has spurred the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members to learn technology. After Zhang Shirong, the captain of the Xujiazhuang Production Team, learned the operating technology of irrigation and drainage machinery, more than 50 commune members proposed to learn from him and strive to master the operating technology of irrigation and drainage machinery in advance. From July to December 5, 1959, this commune has trained more than 80 tractor drivers, 22 car drivers, and 300 irrigation and drainage mechanics; 32 commune members understood the basic principles of electricity, and more than 220 people learned to manufacture local chemical fertilizers. This not only cultivated technical forces for the comprehensive realization of agricultural modernization, but also gave full play to the potential of existing mechanical equipment and promoted the development of agricultural production.

    徐家庄公社逐步实现农业机械化的一项重要措施
    自力更生培养大批技术人材
    农业中学设立技术专科；拖拉机站等附设技术训练班；建立技术传授站和辅导站；多派人到外地学习，多请人来社传授技术，老技术人员多带徒弟
    本报讯　河北省衡水县徐家庄人民公社自力更生大办技术教育，干部带头学习生产技术，积极为实现农业现代化准备技术力量。
    实现农业现代化需要大量的农业技术人员。技术力量从哪里来呢？在徐家庄人民公社有两种意见。有的干部、社员主张向国家要人，有的干部、社员主张自己动手培养。公社党委发动全体干部、社员就这个问题开展了鸣放辩论。讨论的结果是，不能单纯依赖国家，应该自己动手培养。徐家庄生产队1958年买了十九部排灌机械，队里举办了一个技术训练班，两个月就培养了二十五名机械手。漳淮生产队买了十几部排灌机械，光等县里拨给技术人员，结果大部排灌机械没有开动起来，使生产受到影响。这些事实使广大社员、干部，坚定了自力更生培养技术人材的信心。
    这个公社在培养技术人材的过程中，采取了“一校”、“三训”、“两站”、“三多”的方法。“一校”是建立农业中学。1958年秋天，公社办了一所农业中学，设有机械、化学、电力、水利等六科，共有学生五百三十多名。一年的时间，这所学校共给公社培养了六十名排灌机械手、二十名拖拉机手和汽车司机，二十名电力技术人员。“三训”是公社拖拉机站、汽车队、机械站分别附设技术短期训练班，老技术人员担任教员，每月培训一期。自1959年7月下旬开始到年底，已经培养了二百六十多名技术人员。“两站”是建立技术传授站和辅导站。全社五个管理区都建立了技术传授站，每十天吸收各队干部、组长、技术骨干力量等，到传授站听取管理区技术指导小组传授技术。辅导站的任务是帮助各队技术人员解决生产当中的技术困难。由公社拖拉机站、机械站抽出了十二名技术人员，组织了一个辅导组，定时、定点到各生产队帮助解决生产当中的技术问题。“三多”是多派社员到各地学习技术；多请各方面的技术人员来社传授技术；老技术人员多带徒弟。不久前公社派出了七十多名社员，到衡水县机械训练班、天津化工学院、石家庄动力机械厂等地学习；还请了衡水发电厂、衡水机械厂的老技术人员来社传授了机械、电力技术；给开动排灌机械、拖拉机、汽车的老技术工人，分配了带徒弟的任务，实行了包教保学。拖拉机手杨文、姜文森，半年内就培养了三十多名拖拉机手。
    公社党委和各级党组织，对技术教育十分重视。公社建立了技术指导委员会，由第一书记刘立存亲自领导；管理区、生产队也都以支部书记为主，建立了技术指导小组。公社还抽出了三名党委委员和十二名干部，分别到农业中学和拖拉机、汽车、排灌机械训练班去担任校长、班长；公社和生产队的干部并且带头学习技术、掌握技术。公社党委第一书记刘立存晚上住在机械站，有时间就跟技术人员学技术，现在他已经学会了开拖拉机、排灌机械和汽车。公社党委副书记吕丙举，每天晚上到技术训练班去听课。据不完全统计。全公社已经有一百二十名队长以上的干部，分别学会了开拖拉机、汽车和排灌机械的技术。干部学技术、掌握技术，带动了广大社员学习技术的积极性。徐家庄生产队队长张世荣学会了排灌机械的操作技术以后，五十多名社员提出向他学习，争取提前掌握排灌机械的操作技术。从1959年7月到12月5日，这个公社已经培养了八十多名拖拉机手、二十二名汽车司机、三百名排灌机械手；有三十二名社员懂得了电力的基本原理，二百二十多人学会了制造土化肥。这不仅给全面实现农业现代化培养了技术力量，还充分发挥了现有机械设备的潜力，促进了农业生产的发展。
