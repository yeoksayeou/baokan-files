The Polish people welcomed the New Year amidst celebrations of the achievements of 1959. 1959 was the first year of Poland's Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy. In this year, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people displayed tremendous labor enthusiasm and took another big step forward in the cause of socialist construction.

Last March, the Polish United Workers' Party held its Third National Congress, formulated the Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy from 1959 to 1965, and determined the policy of continuing to strengthen socialist industrialization, expanding productivity to improve the people's living standards; and formulated the party's rural policy. This plan demonstrated a new prospect for Poland to further advance towards socialism, greatly encouraged the Polish people, and enabled them to achieve greater success in production.

In 1959, Poland achieved great success on the industrial front. The development of the entire industry, especially heavy industry, was quite rapid. Industrial production overfulfilled the annual plan by 1.3%, and the total industrial output value increased by 8.5% compared with 1958, of which the output value of heavy industry increased by 15%.

Poland's important industrial sector, the coal mining industry, thanks to the systematic improvement of labor organization and production processes, technological innovations, and the development of small-scale mechanization that does not require large investments but produces quick and significant results, achieved the highest historical level of coal production last year - 99 million tons, an increase of 4 million tons in one year for the first time in the past six years.

The machine manufacturing industry, which accounts for one-fifth of Poland's total national economic output value, also achieved remarkable results last year. In the past, Poland's machine manufacturing sector could produce more than 300 types of machines and equipment. However, in 1959 alone, more than 70 new types of machines were added, and most of them have already begun mass production. In addition to producing various new types of machine tools, locomotives, and microcars, the first 18,000-ton deadweight ship was also built this year. In order to meet the needs of developing the electric power and chemical industries, Poland mass-produced electric motors, turbo-generators, 120,000-kilowatt combined units, and various chemical industry machines for manufacturing synthetic fibers and artificial fertilizers.

The steel and electric power industries in Poland also performed well in 1959. Steel increased by 500,000 tons compared with 1958, with a total output of more than 6 million tons, and electricity increased by 2.3 billion kilowatt-hours compared with 1958. The increase in power generation in this year alone is equivalent to the total power generation in Poland in 1935 before the war.

Poland's fastest-growing chemical industry sector overfulfilled the production plan by 4% last year, and the output value will increase by 17.5% compared with 1958. New products in the chemical industry sector are increasing very rapidly, with an average of more than one new product appearing every day, an increase of 128 types compared with 1958.

A characteristic of Poland's economic development in 1959 was that the production of means of production grew the fastest in recent years, increasing by about 10.2% compared with 1958, overfulfilling the plan by 3.9%.

1959 was a year of large-scale construction and strengthening of basic construction in Poland. Currently, there are 120 large-scale enterprises under construction in Poland, of which dozens of large-scale construction and expansion projects started in 1959. The important tasks put forward by the Polish people in terms of basic construction are to establish new industrial raw material bases, expand fuel and power industry bases, develop relatively backward areas in the domestic economy, and change the imbalance in the allocation of productive forces in various regions. Poland did a lot of work in these areas in 1959. For example, Poland concentrated its efforts on developing the Konin-Kujawy and Turov two huge power, fuel, and chemical industry zones rich in lignite and salt mines. Expansion projects of sixteen deep mine shafts and open-pit mines, and construction projects of two new mines also began. At the same time, in order to change the allocation of productive forces, Poland's construction work last year focused on developing the western region, especially the three northern provinces of Szczecin, Koszalin, and Olsztyn in this region, and the relatively backward counties and small and medium-sized cities belonging to the provinces of Bialystok and Rzeszow.

Due to the growth of the laboring people's production enthusiasm, labor productivity also greatly improved in 1959. According to preliminary statistics, Poland's labor productivity will increase by 7.3% in 1959 compared with 1958. The growth of labor productivity in the coal mining industry sector was quite rapid. In 1959, the daily coal output per miner reached 1,240 kilograms, an increase of 53 kilograms compared with 1958. In nineteen mines, the daily coal output per miner increased by more than 100 kilograms compared with 1958. The increase in labor productivity in other industrial sectors was also very rapid. For example, compared with 1958, the labor productivity of the entire metallurgical industry increased by 13%, and the blast furnace workshop increased by 20%.

In agriculture, although Poland suffered severe drought in 1959, good harvests were still achieved for the four types of grains and oil crops, with average yields per hectare reaching 15.6 quintals and 14 quintals respectively.

The production of state-owned farms also improved significantly in 1959. Among the more than 3,000 state-owned farms in Poland, although the number of workers was reduced by a quarter compared with 1956, labor productivity increased by 40%. The yield per unit area has also increased compared with before: the total value of marketable grain produced per hectare of land has increased from 1,482 zlotys in 1956 to 1,768 zlotys; the total value of livestock products has also increased by more than 110 zlotys.

According to the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, Poland has taken various measures from 1959 to ensure the continuous improvement of agriculture and animal husbandry in terms of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy construction, and expansion of feed bases. For example, in order to accelerate agricultural mechanization, agricultural machinery factories across the country are being expanded. The agricultural machinery manufacturing sector supplied the rural areas with about 8,000 tractors in 1959, and also imported a large number of agricultural machines from countries such as Czechoslovakia and Hungary. In addition, the state has established an agricultural development fund. By the end of last year, the state had allocated about 1.5 billion zlotys to the agricultural development fund, of which 700 million zlotys were used to purchase agricultural machines. In a few months, farmers in various places have used the agricultural development fund to purchase 1,700 tractors.

Another major measure for developing agriculture is to build water conservancy projects and expand irrigation areas. By the end of last year, 9,000 water conservancy and soil improvement groups had been organized in various parts of Poland, with the participation of 120,000 farmers.

1959 was also a year of high political and labor enthusiasm for the Polish working people. In order to welcome the convening of the Third National Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people launched a large-scale labor competition, and industrial and mining enterprises across the country were involved in this movement to dedicate production achievements to the Party Congress. As many as 400,000 young people participated in this dedication movement alone. The laboring people achieved brilliant achievements in the dedication movement to welcome the Party Congress. For example, Polish steelworkers brilliantly achieved a record of producing 500,000 tons of steel per month for the first time in history. In the movement to dedicate gifts to the Party, the Polish Socialist Youth League organized 6,000 action teams, and another 3,500 youth production teams composed of members of the Socialist Youth League and young people, ensuring the creation of wealth worth 500 million zlotys for the country. The young people also created a new form of "youth relay race" in the competition movement. More than 5,000 youth groups participated in this competition.

The high enthusiasm of the Polish people in building socialism is also reflected in the discussion of the Seven-Year Plan for Poland's development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965. Employees of all industrial and mining enterprises across the country enthusiastically participated in this discussion. In the discussion, they unanimously supported the development goals put forward by the Party, assured the Party that they would overfulfill the targets of the Seven-Year Plan, and actively put forward various suggestions for improving and increasing production. For example, employees in Katowice Province put forward more than 20,000 suggestions in the discussion of the instructions of the Seven-Year Plan, and the implementation of these suggestions will enable the country to produce products worth 5 billion zlotys more.

The Polish people are marching on the road of socialist construction with firm steps, advancing confidently towards the goals of 1960 with full confidence.

In this new year, Poland will continue to develop the cause of socialist construction along the lines formulated by the Third National Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party. According to the plan for developing the national economy, Poland's industrial production will increase by 7.6% this year compared with 1959. Industry will continue to develop at a high speed: coal will reach 103 million tons, an increase of 4 million tons compared with 1959; electricity - 29 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 9% compared with 1959; steel will reach 6.5 million tons. The growth of the machine manufacturing industry is particularly rapid. Compared with 1959, steam turbines will increase by 86.5%, sea ships - more than 40%, trucks - 70.9%, and electric locomotives - 33.3%. The chemical industry will grow by 14.1%.

A characteristic of Poland's production and construction investment this year is that the proportion of investment in the production of means of production will continue to increase: investment in the production of means of production will increase by 7.3%, and investment in the production of consumer goods will increase by 4.1%. Increasing the amount of investment in the production of means of production will prepare conditions for the construction tasks of the new Five-Year Plan from 1961 to 1965. In the construction in 1960, construction funds will be used for projects that have already started but need to be completed urgently, and to ensure that a series of small-scale enterprises with short construction periods have priority in obtaining funds.

In the new year, Poland will regard improving labor productivity in industry, construction, and other sectors as the primary task. Labor productivity in the industrial sector should increase by at least 7% compared with 1959, and 92% of the increase in industrial production should be achieved by increasing labor productivity. In order to complete this huge task, the production potential of industrial enterprises will be tapped, technological innovations will be carried out, and new and more effective technological processes and better designs will be adopted. In addition, labor organization will be vigorously improved and labor discipline will be strengthened, and management of the wage fund will be rectified and the current labor quotas will be initially adjusted.

While accelerating the development of heavy industry, light industry will also be developed accordingly in 1960, increasing by 5%-6% compared with 1959.

Poland's total agricultural output value will increase by 3.8% this year compared with 1959. Among them, crop production will increase by 5%, and animal husbandry production will increase by 2%. In order to complete this task, the Polish United Workers' Party has formulated many specific measures. First of all, investment in agriculture will be significantly increased. Under the circumstances that the total investment in the national economy will increase by 6.3% compared with 1959, agricultural investment will increase by 22.4%. At the same time, 1960 will be the first year for Poland to realize the agricultural mechanization program relying on the agricultural development fund. In addition to budget investment, 3.5 billion zlotys will be allocated as an agricultural development fund, which is more than double that of 1959. The agricultural fund supplied to rural areas will be mainly used to purchase machines. It is estimated that 8,800 tractors and auxiliary units will be supplied to rural areas.

Solving the feed problem will be the most important task in the development of animal husbandry. To this end, a large amount of grain was left in rural areas in 1959 as feed. In addition, the state will also supply rural areas with a large amount of chemical fertilizers and chemical agents, with chemical fertilizers increasing by 14.3% compared with 1959, and chemical agents increasing by nearly 40%.

In order to implement and execute the Party's policy and measures for developing agriculture, and to give play to the enthusiasm of farmers, Poland will organize rural activists, employees of state-owned farms, members of agricultural production cooperatives, and members of agricultural groups in the next three months to discuss the agricultural development problems and tasks in 1960, vigorously eliminate the consequences of the drought in 1959, and strive to obtain a bumper harvest of grain, meat, and other crops this year.

The Polish people are reviewing the achievements of the past year, looking forward to the beautiful prospects of this year, and marching forward with big strides towards the goals designated by the Party.

    波兰人民跨进了新的一年
    张家骥
    波兰人民在欢庆1959年的建设成就声中，迎接了新的一年。1959年是波兰开始实现发展国民经济的七年计划的第一年。在这一年中，波兰人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下，发挥了巨大的劳动热情，在社会主义建设事业方面又向前迈进了一大步。
    去年3月，波兰统一工人党召开了第三次代表大会，制定了1959—1965年发展国民经济的七年计划，确定了继续加强社会主义工业化，扩大生产力，以提高人民的生活水平的方针；制定了党的农村政策。这一计划展现了波兰进一步向社会主义迈进的新前景，大大鼓舞了波兰人民，使他们在生产中取得更大的成就。
                ×　×　×
    1959年，波兰在工业战线上取得了巨大的成就。整个工业、尤其是重工业的发展相当迅速。工业生产超额1．3％完成了年度计划，工业总产值比1958年增长8．5％，其中重工业产值增长了15％。
    波兰的重要工业部门采煤工业，由于有系统地改善了劳动组织和生产过程，进行了技术革新，发展了不需要大量投资而生产效果又快又显著的小型机械化，使去年的煤产量达到了历史最高水平——九千九百万吨，最近六年来第一次在一年内增加了四百万吨。
    占波兰全部国民经济总产值五分之一的机器制造业，去年也取得了显著的成绩。过去，波兰机器制造部门能生产三百种以上的机器和设备。然而，仅仅1959年一年就增加了七十种以上的新型机器，并且其中大部都已开始成批生产。这一年除生产了各种新式机床、机车，微型汽车外，还建造了第一艘载重量达一万八千吨的轮船。为了满足发展电力和化学工业的需要，波兰大量生产了电动机、涡轮发电机、十二万瓩的联合机组以及制造合成纤维和人造肥料等各种化学工业机器。
    波兰钢铁和电力工业部门1959年的生产情况也很好。钢比1958年增加了五十万吨，总产量达到六百万吨以上，电力比1958年增加了二十三亿度。单是这一年增加的发电量就相当于波兰战前1935年全年的发电量。
    波兰发展最迅速的化学工业部门去年超额4％完成了生产计划，产值将比1958年增长17．5％。化学工业部门的新产品增加得非常快，平均每天出现一种以上新产品，比1958年增加了一百二十八种。
    1959年波兰经济发展的一个特点是，生产资料的生产是最近几年来增长最快的一年，约比1958年增长10．2％，超额3．9％完成了计划。
    1959年是波兰大兴土木，加强基本建设的一年。目前，波兰正在建设中的大型企业有一百二十项，其中1959年开工兴建和扩建的大型工程项目就有几十个。波兰人民提出的基本建设方面的重要任务是建立新的工业原料基地，扩大燃料和动力工业基地，发展国内经济比较落后的地区，改变各地区生产力配置的不平衡。1959年波兰在这几方面作了许多工作。例如，波兰集中力量开发盛产褐煤和盐矿的科宁—库雅维和图鲁夫两个巨大的动力、燃料、化学工业区。还开始了十六个深矿井和露天矿井的扩建工程，两个新矿井的建设工程。同时，为了改变生产力的配置，去年波兰的建设工作着重于发展西部地区，特别是这一地区的什切青、柯萨林、奥尔兹丁等三个北方省份和属于比亚里斯多克、热舒夫等省的比较落后的县份和中小城市。
    由于劳动人民生产热情的增长，1959年劳动生产率也大大提高了。据初步统计，1959年波兰劳动生产率将比1958年增长7 ．3％。在采煤工业部门中，劳动生产率的增长相当快。1959年每名矿工的日采煤量达到了一千二百四十公斤，比1958年增加了五十三公斤。而在十九座矿井中，矿工的日采煤量比1958年增加了一百公斤以上。其他工业部门的劳动生产率增加也很迅速。例如和1958年相比，整个冶金工业的劳动生产率提高了13％，高炉车间则提高了20％。
            ×　×　×
    在农业方面，波兰1959年虽然遭受了严重的旱灾，然而四种谷物和油料作物仍然获得了良好的收成，每公顷平均产量分别达到了十五点六公担和十四公担。
    国营农场的生产在1959年也有了显著的提高。在波兰三千多个国营农场中，工人数量虽比1956年减少了四分之一，但劳动生产率却提高了40％。单位面积产量也比以前有了增长：每公顷土地生产的商品粮食的总值已从1956年的一千四百八十二兹罗提提高到一千七百六十八兹罗提；畜产品的总值也增加了一百一十兹罗提以上。
    根据波兰统一工人党二中全会的决议，波兰从1959年起，在农业机械化、兴修水利、扩大饲料基地方面，采取了各种措施，以保证农业和畜牧业的不断提高。例如，为了加速农业机械化，全国各地农业机械厂都在进行扩建。农业机械制造部门在1959年供应农村八千台左右的拖拉机，同时还从捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利等国进口了大量农业机器。此外，国家还建立了发展农业基金。到去年年底，国家拨作农业发展基金的款项已达十五亿兹罗提左右，其中有七亿兹罗提被用来购置农业机器。在几个月的时间里，各地农民已利用发展农业基金购买了一千七百台拖拉机。
    发展农业的另一巨大措施是兴修水利，扩大灌溉面积。到去年年底，波兰各地已经组织起九千个经营水利和土壤改良小组，参加的农民有十二万人。
             ×　×　×
    1959年也是波兰劳动人民政治和劳动热情高涨的一年。波兰人民为了迎接波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会的召开，展开了一个规模巨大的劳动竞赛，全国各地工矿企业都卷入了这一个以生产成就向党代会献礼的运动。单是参加这一献礼运动的青年就有四十万人。劳动人民在迎接党代表大会的献礼运动中取得了光辉的成就。例如，波兰的钢铁工人在历史上第一次出色地达到了月产五十万吨钢的记录。波兰社会主义青年联盟在向党献礼的运动中，组织了六千个行动小组，另外还由社会主义青年联盟的盟员和青年组成了三千五百多个青年生产队，保证为国家创造价值五亿兹罗提的财富。青年们并且在竞赛运动中创造了“青年接力竞赛”的新形式。有五千多个青年小组参加了这一竞赛。
    波兰人民建设社会主义的高涨热情，还表现在讨论1959—1965年波兰发展国民经济的七年计划上面。全国所有工矿企业的职工热烈地参加了这一讨论。他们在讨论中一致支持党所提出来的发展目标，向党保证要超额完成七年计划的指标，并且踊跃提出了改进和增加生产的各种建议。例如，卡托维兹省的职工在讨论七年计划的指示中提出了两万多条建议，实现这些建议将使国家多生产价值五十亿兹罗提的产品。
              ×　×　×
    波兰人民在社会主义建设的大道上，正在迈着坚定的步伐，满怀信心地向1960年的目标挺进。
    在这新的一年中，波兰将继续沿着波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会所制定的方针，发展社会主义建设事业。根据发展国民经济的计划，今年波兰工业生产将比1959年增长7．6％。工业仍将以快速度发展：煤将达到一亿零三百万吨，比1959年增加四百万吨；电——二百九十亿度，比1959年增长9％；钢达到六百五十万吨。机器制造业的增长尤为迅速。同1959年相比，汽轮机将增加86．5％，海船——40％以上，载重汽车——70．9％，电力机车——33．3％。化学工业将增长14．1％。
    今年波兰生产建设的投资特点是生产资料生产的投资比例将继续增长：生产资料生产投资将增长7．3％，消费资料生产的投资增长4．1％。增加生产资料生产的投资额将为1961—1965年的新五年计划的建设任务准备条件。在1960年的建设中，将把建设资金用在现在已经开始的，但是需要加紧完成的工程上面，并且要保证一系列规模小、建设期限短的企业有获得资金的优先权。
    波兰在新的一年中，将把提高工业、建筑以及其他部门的劳动生产率当作首要任务。工业部门的劳动生产率至少要比1959年增加7％，工业增产量的92％要通过提高劳动生产率来达到。为了完成这一巨大任务，将在工业企业中挖掘生产潜力，进行技术革新，采用新的更有效的工艺过程和更好的设计。此外，还将大力改进劳动组织和加强劳动纪律，着手整顿工资基金的管理和初步调整现行的劳动定额。
    在加速发展重工业的同时，轻工业在1960年也将相应地得到发展，和1959年相比，将提高5％—6％。
    波兰农业总产值今年将比1959年增长3．8％。其中农作物生产将增长5％，畜牧业生产将增长2％。为了完成这项任务，波兰统一工人党已经拟定了许多具体措施。首先将显著增加对农业的投资。在国民经济总投资额比1959年增长6．3％的情形下，农业投资将增长22．4％。同时，1960年将是波兰依靠农业发展基金实现农业机械化纲领的第一年。除预算投资外，还将拨出三十五亿兹罗提作为发展农业基金，这比1959年增加一倍以上。供给农村的农业基金将主要用来购买机器。预计，供给农村的拖拉机和辅助机组将达八千八百台。
    解决饲料问题将是畜牧业发展中的最重要任务。为此，1959年把大量的谷物留在了农村，作为饲料。此外，国家还将大量供应农村化学肥料和化学药剂，化学肥料将比1959年增加14．3％，化学药剂将增加近40％。
    为了贯彻和执行党的发展农业的方针和措施，发挥农民的积极性，波兰将在最近三个月内，组织农村积极分子、国营农场职工、农业生产合作社社员和农业小组组员，讨论1960年的农业发展问题和任务，大力消除1959年旱灾所带来的后果，争取在今年获得粮食、肉类以及其他农作物的丰收。
    波兰人民正在回顾过去一年的成就，瞻望今年的美好前景，大踏步地向党所指定的目标前进。
