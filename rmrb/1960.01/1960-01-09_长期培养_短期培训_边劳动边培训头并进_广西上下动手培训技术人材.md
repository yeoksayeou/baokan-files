Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 8th. Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is training technical personnel for agriculture on a large scale. With the development of agricultural technology transformation, Guangxi's agricultural front urgently needs a large number of various technical personnel. In addition to cultivation by agricultural, forestry, and hydropower professional colleges, relevant departments have adopted a method of mobilizing all levels of government offices, schools, and communes to achieve simultaneous advancement of long-term cultivation, short-term training, and combining labor with training.

Agricultural middle schools, which supply a large number of technical cadres to agriculture, have increased from 703 in October 1959 to 1,062, with an enrollment of more than 89,000 students. Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over agricultural middle schools. In Guilin Prefecture alone, 113 leading cadres have recently been sent to agricultural middle schools to take on leadership positions in the past two months. The teaching activities of agricultural middle schools have also been greatly enriched. Combining general cultural education, they vigorously carry out scientific experiments on food crops, cash crops, vegetables, fruits, poultry, and livestock, and are also linked with factories and hydropower stations, regularly organizing students to visit and intern.

The autonomous region's agricultural departments and relevant scientific research institutions have all listed the training of agricultural technical personnel as one of their main tasks, in accordance with the needs of agricultural production development and agricultural technology transformation. The Autonomous Region's Agricultural Machinery Research Institute, while vigorously promoting new agricultural tools and machinery, has adopted short-term rotational training and on-site teaching methods. In the past three months, it has trained 319 agricultural technical personnel for 57 counties. The Autonomous Region's Agricultural Science Research Institute uses its two teams of personnel to actively train agricultural technicians while conducting scientific research in combination with practical application. One team, stationed permanently in people's communes, combines the systematic summarization of mass production experience with running various technical schools, training classes, and specialized teams, directly training technical personnel for the communes through research experiments, field teaching, on-site visits, and apprenticeship. The team stationed in the Xiashi Brigade of the Qunying Commune in Ningming County has trained 22 personnel in rice cultivation, improved seed selection, and agricultural meteorology for the brigade in the half year since the technical school opened. The other team, remaining at the institute, combines various experimental research work with cooperating with relevant departments to organize agricultural technology training courses, drawing technicians and experienced farmers from various counties and communes for cultivation and training, helping them grasp more systematic scientific knowledge. The seed training class run in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture in the second half of last year, with its first phase of 316 commune members, technicians, and cadres, has reached a relatively high level in terms of professional seed knowledge after two months of systematic study.

The more than 8,400 agricultural science experiment fields of communes and brigades throughout the autonomous region have become another important base for cultivating mass technical teams. According to statistics from the Yulin, Liuzhou, and Wuzhou prefectures by the end of last year, 725 experimental fields had more than 29,000 people participating in scientific research activities. Under the guidance of the personnel of the Autonomous Region's Agricultural Science Research Institute stationed in the communes and the technical cadres in the experimental fields, this mass research team, mainly composed of young people, has generally mastered basic agricultural knowledge such as crop cultivation and improved seed selection through practical operation and field lectures.

    长期培养　短期培训　边劳动边培训头并进
    广西上下动手培训技术人材
    新华社南宁8日电　广西僮族自治区大规模地为农业培训技术人材。随着农业技术改造的开展，广西农业战线急需大批各种技术人材。除了由农、林、水电等专业院校进行培养外，有关部门采取了机关、学校、公社上下一起动手的办法，作到长期培养、短期培训、边劳动边培训齐头并进。
    为农业输送大批技术干部的农业中学，已由1959年10月的七百零三所增加到一千零六十二所，入学人数达到八万九千多人。各级党委都加强了对农业中学的领导，仅桂林专区最近两个月来就增派了一百一十三名领导干部到农业中学担任领导工作。农业中学教学活动也大大充实，他们结合一般文化教学，大搞粮食、经济作物、蔬菜、果木、家禽家畜的科学试验，并且与工厂、水电站挂钩，定期组织学生参观、实习。
    自治区农业部门和有关科学研究机关，按照农业生产发展和农业技术改造的需要，都把培训农业技术人材列为主要工作之一。自治区农业机械研究所在大力推广新式农具、农业机械时，采取短期轮训、现场教学办法，三个月来，为五十七个县先后培训了三百一十九名农业技术人材。自治区农业科学研究所利用所里两套人马，在上下结合开展科学研究中，同时积极培训农业技术人员。长驻人民公社的一套人马，结合系统总结群众生产经验，开办各种技术学校、训练班、专业队，通过研究实验、田头教学、现场参观、带徒弟等办法，直接为公社培养技术人材。长驻宁明县群英公社夏石大队的小组，半年来，开办的技术学校为大队培养出二十二名水稻栽培、良种选育、农业气象人材。另一套留在所里的人马，结合各种试验研究工作，配合有关部门组织农业技术专题训练班，抽调各县、公社技术员和老农加以培养训练，帮助他们掌握较系统的科学知识。去年下半年配合农业厅开办的种子训练班，第一期三百一十六名公社社员、技术员、干部，经过两个月来的系统学习，在种子专业知识方面都已达到较高的水平。
    遍布全自治区的八千四百多个公社、大队的农业科学试验场，已成为培养群众技术队伍的另一个重要基地。据玉林、柳州、梧州三个专区到去年年底的统计，七百二十五个试验场，就有二万九千多人参加了科学实验研究活动。这批以青年为主的群众研究队伍，在自治区农业科学研究所长驻公社人员及试验场里技术干部指导下，通过实地操作、田头讲学等形式，一般都掌握了作物栽培、良种选育等基础农业知识。
