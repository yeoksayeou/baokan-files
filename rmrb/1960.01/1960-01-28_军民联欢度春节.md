　　The Spring Festival is coming. This is a traditional festival for the army and people to celebrate together, extend greetings, and enthusiastically carry out activities to support the army and cherish the people and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs.
　　This year's Spring Festival coincides with the great victory our people have achieved in completing the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. It is truly a time of blooming flowers bidding farewell to the old year, and myriad colors welcoming the new spring. During this joyful festival, the Chinese people deeply miss their own soldiers – the People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers who vigilantly safeguard the security of the motherland and socialist construction. Whether in the scorching summer or the bitter winter, whether in wind or rain, they guard the skies, borders, and coasts of the motherland day and night with infinite loyalty to the country and high vigilance against the enemy. They hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong's military thought and have made tremendous efforts for the modernization of national defense. It is precisely because of their unremitting struggle that the imperialists and the remnant Kuomintang clique in Taiwan do not dare to act rashly, and that our socialist construction can proceed safely. The People's Liberation Army, while heroically defending the socialist construction of the motherland, has also participated on a large scale in the mass movement of socialist construction. They have supported various localities in industry, transportation, geological exploration, and capital construction with manpower, materials, technology, etc.; and have participated in agricultural production such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, drought resistance, flood prevention, and disaster relief. According to incomplete statistics for 1959 alone, they participated in more than 40 million labor days for various construction projects. While performing the arduous tasks of defending the motherland and participating in national construction, the People's Liberation Army has also vigorously developed sideline production, improved their lives through self-reliance, and reduced the burden on the state and the people. The People's Liberation Army is loved by the people, who sing praises of their army: "The peacock's feathers are the most beautiful, and Chairman Mao's soldiers are the best." The reason this army is so powerful is, as Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Coalition Government": "This army is powerful because all its members have a conscious discipline; they have come together and fight not for the private interests of a few individuals or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people and of the whole nation. The sole purpose of this army is to stand firmly with the Chinese people and to serve them wholeheartedly." Therefore, the People's Liberation Army, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, is not only a loyal defender of national security, but also an important shock force in China's socialist construction. On this festive occasion, we, along with the people of the whole country, extend our warm greetings and thanks to all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.
　　Families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary armymen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and the broad masses of demobilized and retired soldiers have made contributions to the people's revolution in the past, and are now working diligently in various posts of socialist construction, with a large number of model figures emerging and making contributions to the socialist cause. On this festive occasion, we also extend our cordial greetings to them along with the people of the whole country, and hope that they will continue to carry forward their glorious traditions and make greater contributions to socialist construction and strengthening national defense.
　　In the past year, under the leadership of our Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups in China, Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country, in accordance with the general line of socialist construction, have achieved a tremendous victory in completing the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. All officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are deeply moved and encouraged by the great strength of the people of the whole country. The People's Liberation Army fully understands that only by developing the national economy at a high speed and in proportion, in accordance with the Party's general line of socialist construction, can the happy lives of our people be improved more rapidly, and the modernization of our national defense be realized more rapidly and completely. The people's communes created by the Chinese people not only play a huge role in developing production and improving the people's cultural and material lives, but also build the national defense strength of the motherland on an incomparably solid foundation. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army actively supports the general line of socialist construction and enthusiastically supports the great mass movement of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes. The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have a relationship with the people as close as fish and water, which is the infinite source of our invincible armed forces. The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army has issued instructions requiring all officers and soldiers to enthusiastically hold joint celebrations with local Party and government organs and people's organizations to strengthen unity; at the same time, to conduct inspections of the implementation of policies and discipline, to conduct education on Mao Zedong's military thought and socialism, and to promote the leap forward in all aspects of the army's construction.
　　Now, people of all ethnic groups across the country, the People's Liberation Army, militiamen, families of martyrs and armymen, and demobilized soldiers, are enthusiastically launching campaigns to support the army, give preferential treatment to families of armymen and martyrs, and cherish the people, with joy and excitement. Through this year's Spring Festival army-people celebration, the unity between the people and the army across the country will be further strengthened. This is the most important guarantee for the prosperity and strength of our great socialist motherland.

### 军民联欢度春节

    军民联欢度春节
    新春佳节到来了。这是军民联欢、互致慰问、热烈展开拥军优属、拥政爱民活动的传统的节日。
    今年的新春佳节，正值我国人民取得了提前三年完成第二个五年计划的伟大胜利。真是百花献瑞辞旧岁，万紫千红迎新春。在这个万众欢乐的佳节，我国人民深深想念着自己的子弟兵——警惕地保卫祖国安全和社会主义建设的人民解放军全体官兵同志们。他们无论是在炎热的夏天，酷寒的冬季，无论是在风里雨里，都以对祖国的无限忠诚和对敌人的高度警惕，日日夜夜辛勤捍卫着祖国的天空、边防和海防。他们高举着毛泽东军事思想的红旗，为国防现代化的建设进行了巨大努力。正是由于他们的不懈的斗争，才使得帝国主义者和台湾国民党残余集团不敢轻举妄动，使得我国的社会主义建设事业能够安全地进行。人民解放军一面英勇地保卫祖国社会主义的建设，一面大规模地参加了社会主义建设的群众运动。他们以人力、物力、技术等等支援了各地的工业、交通、地质勘探、基本建设；参加了兴修水利、积肥造林、抗旱防洪、抢险救灾等农业生产。仅据1959年的不完全的统计，他们参加各项建设事业的劳动日就达四千多万个。人民解放军在执行捍卫祖国和参加国家建设的繁重任务的同时，还大力展开副业生产，自己动手改善生活，减轻了国家和人民负担。人民解放军受到人民的最大的爱戴，“孔雀的羽毛最美，毛主席的战士最好”，各族人民就是这样歌颂自己的军队的。这个军队之所以有力量，正如毛泽东同志在“论联合政府”中所说的：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律；他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨”。所以，在毛泽东思想培育下的人民解放军不但是国家安全的忠实保卫者，也是我国社会主义建设的一支重要突击力量。值此新春佳节，我们同全国人民一起，谨向人民解放军全体官兵同志们致以热烈慰问和感谢。
    革命烈士家属，革命军人家属，荣誉军人和广大复员退伍军人，他们过去曾经对人民革命作出了贡献，现在也在社会主义建设的各个岗位上辛勤劳动，涌现了大量的模范人物，为社会主义事业立下功劳。值此新春佳节，我们也同全国人民一道，对他们致以亲切的慰问，希望他们继续发扬光荣传统，对社会主义建设和加强国防做出更大的贡献。
    过去一年中，全国人民在我们的党和全国各族人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，按照社会主义建设总路线，取得了提前三年完成第二个五年计划的巨大胜利。人民解放军全体官兵，深深地为全国人民这种伟大力量所感动和鼓舞。人民解放军完全懂得：只有按照党的社会主义建设总路线，高速度、按比例地发展国民经济，我国人民的幸福生活才能更迅速地提高，我国国防的现代化才能更迅速更完全地实现。我国人民创造的人民公社，不仅对发展生产事业、提高人民文化和物质生活起着巨大的作用，并且使祖国的国防力量建筑在无比巩固的基础上。因此，人民解放军积极拥护社会主义建设总路线，热烈地支持大跃进和人民公社的伟大群众运动。人民解放军是人民的子弟兵。人民解放军官兵们同人民群众鱼水相得，亲如骨肉，是我国不可战胜的武装力量的无限源泉。人民解放军总政治部已经发出了指示，要求全军官兵热烈地同地方党政机关和人民群众组织联欢，加强团结；同时进行执行政策纪律的检查，进行毛泽东军事思想和社会主义教育，推动部队各方面建设的跃进。
    现在，全国各族人民，人民解放军、民兵和烈属、军属，以及复员军人同志们，正以欢欣鼓舞的心情热烈展开拥军优属、拥政爱民的活动。通过今年春节的军民联欢，全国人民和军队的团结将进一步加强。这是我们伟大的社会主义的祖国繁荣富强的最重要的保证。
