    Strengthen Leadership, Fully Support, and Eliminate “Water Conservancy Dead Spots” Through Shock Tactics
    Balanced Development of Water Conservancy Construction in Anhui
    Dingyuan, Fengyang, and 11 Other Counties Vigorously Catch Up, Completing 91% of Advanced Water Conservancy Tasks

    (Our Reporter Chen Liyan, Shi Zhengzhang report from Hefei on the 25th) To ensure the balanced development of water conservancy construction, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the task of "eliminating water conservancy dead spots" last winter, and has achieved remarkable results. As of January 18, the eleven "water conservancy dead spot" counties in the province have completed a total of 436 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, accounting for 91% of the winter and spring water conservancy construction tasks, and have expanded and improved the irrigated area by 5.7 million mu. At present, all parties are continuing to vigorously support these eleven counties, demanding that the province's "water conservancy dead spots" be resolutely eliminated this spring.
    Anhui Province has carried out large-scale water conservancy construction for ten consecutive years since liberation, and the irrigated area has expanded from 23 million mu in the early days of liberation to 61 million mu. Especially in the Huaibei area, large-scale river network projects have changed the face of frequent disasters. However, from a regional perspective, the development of water conservancy construction work was still uneven before the winter of 1959; especially under the severe drought last year, some areas of the province still suffered drought and reduced production. The eleven counties of Dingyuan, Fengyang, Jiashan, He County, Hanshan, Wuwei, Zongyang, Xuancheng, Langxi, Guangde, and Fengtai, where water conservancy construction was relatively weak in the past, suffered drought on 8.47 million mu, accounting for 60% of the cultivated land area.
    The broad masses have an urgent demand to completely eliminate this natural disaster. After the Provincial Party Committee put forward the task of eliminating "water conservancy dead spots," these areas quickly set off a wave of water conservancy construction: large-scale construction of reservoir groups in mountainous areas, and large-scale irrigation networks in hilly areas. In two months, Dingyuan County rushed to build ten medium-sized reservoirs with a water storage capacity of more than 10 million cubic meters, and more than seventy small reservoirs with a water storage capacity of more than 500,000 cubic meters. At the same time, it also built some ponds, ditches and canals. The county increased its water storage capacity by more than 250 million cubic meters, which is more than 20 million cubic meters more than the existing water storage capacity of all water conservancy projects, and can increase and improve the irrigated area by 1.6 million mu, completing 82% of the winter and spring expansion and improvement of the irrigated area plan. Now 160,000 laborers are again fighting on the construction sites of the newly started ten medium-sized reservoirs and more than fifty small reservoirs, actively expanding their achievements. Langxi County, with a population of only 170,000, is simultaneously rushing to build four large and medium-sized reservoirs that started construction last winter. After these backbone projects are completed this spring, connected to thousands of small-scale projects, they can ensure that 95% of the county's farmland has water for irrigation even under a severe drought like in 1959. By the beginning of January, Xuancheng County had started construction on 12,400 reservoirs, ponds, dams, ditches, and dikes, of which 9,958 had been completed, which can expand and improve the irrigated area by nearly 400,000 mu. By the beginning of January, Wuwei County had completed more than 41 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, increasing the water storage capacity by 39 million cubic meters.
    Rapidly eliminating the "dead spots" in water conservancy construction is an important measure to ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year. In leading the layout of water conservancy construction, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China first regarded the elimination of "water conservancy dead spots" as the key and main combat task for this winter and spring construction. Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally studied and formulated a plan for the province to eliminate "water conservancy dead spots" with the water conservancy department. According to the Provincial Party Committee's plan, the relevant county party committees organized forces to investigate and find out the situation, and made specific plans based on the specific characteristics of the terrain and water sources, dividing them into districts. The Provincial and Prefectural Party Committees transferred some responsible cadres to station at various points to strengthen leadership and provide support in technology and materials. These "water conservancy dead spot" counties, most of which are located in hilly areas, built large and medium-sized water storage projects in accordance with local conditions, using them as the backbone to connect various small projects or build large culverts and pumping stations to draw water from the Yangtze River, the Huai River, and Chaohu Lake, to solve the problem of farmland water demand from multiple aspects. After these projects are completed, the irrigation of 14 million mu of cultivated land in the eleven counties can be basically solved, and even if they encounter a major drought like in 1959, they can ensure a bumper harvest.

### 加强领导　全力支援　突击消灭“水利死角”  安徽水利建设平衡发展  定远凤阳等11县猛追先进水利任务完成91％

    加强领导　全力支援　突击消灭“水利死角”
    安徽水利建设平衡发展
    定远凤阳等11县猛追先进水利任务完成91％
    本报合肥25日电　记者陈立言、石正章报道：中共安徽省委为了使水利建设平衡发展，从去冬就提出了“消灭水利死角”的任务，并已取得了显著成效。截至1月18日的统计，全省十一个“水利死角”县，累计已完成土石方四亿三千六百万立方米，占这一冬春兴修水利任务的91％，扩大和改善灌溉面积已达五百七十万亩。现在，各方面正继续大力支援这十一个县，要求今春坚决消灭全省的“水利死角”。
    安徽省解放十年来连年大兴水利，灌溉面积已由解放初期的二千三百万亩扩大到六千一百万亩。特别是淮北地区，大搞河网工程，已改变了多灾的面貌。但从地区上来看，在1959年冬天以前，水利建设工作开展的还不平衡；尤其在去年的特大旱情下，全省还有一部分地区受旱减产。过去水利兴修较薄弱的定远、凤阳、嘉山、和县、含山、无为、枞阳、宣城、郎溪、广德、凤台等十一个县，受旱面积达八百四十七万亩，占耕地面积60％。
    广大群众对彻底消灭这种自然灾害有迫切的要求。当省委提出消灭“水利死角”的任务后，这些地区很快就掀起了水利兴修的热潮：山区大建水库群，丘陵区大搞灌溉网。定远县在两个月当中，突击建成了十个蓄水在一千万立方米以上的中型水库，七十多个蓄水五十万立方米以上的小型水库，同时还修建了一些水塘、沟渠工程。全县增加了二点五亿多立方米的蓄水量，比原有的全部水利工程的蓄水量还多二千多万立方米，可增加和改善灌溉面积一百六十万亩，完成了去冬今春扩大和改善灌溉面积计划的82％。现在十六万民工又转战在新开工的十个中型水库和五十多个小型水库工地上，积极扩大战果。只有十七万人口的郎溪县，去冬开工的四个大中型水库正在同时赶建。这些骨干工程在今春完成后，连接成万的小型工程，就可保证全县95％的农田在1959年那样的大旱下也有水灌溉。宣城县到1月上旬，已开工的一万二千四百处水库、塘坝、沟渠和圩堤，已完工九千九百五十八处，共可扩大和改善灌溉面积近四十万亩。无为县到1月上旬，已完成土石方四千一百多万立方米，增加蓄水量三千九百万立方米。
    迅速消灭水利建设“死角”，是保证今年农业生产继续跃进的重要措施。中共安徽省委在领导兴修水利的布局上，首先把消灭“水利死角”作为去冬今春兴修的重点和主要的战斗任务。省委第一书记曾希圣同志亲自同水利部门研究和制定了全省消灭“水利死角”的方案。有关县委根据省委方案，组织力量调查摸底，并根据地形、水源等具体特点，分区划片作出了具体规划。省委、地委抽调一些负责干部分驻各点，加强领导，并在技术上、物质上给予支持。这些大都处于丘陵地区的“水利死角”县，因地制宜地修建大中型的蓄水工程，以此作为骨干，串连各种小型工程或建大型涵闸和抽水机站，抽取长江水、淮河水和巢湖水，从多方面解决农田需水问题。这些工程完成后，十一个县一千四百万亩耕地的灌溉就可以基本解决，即使再遇到1959年那样大旱，也能保证丰收。
