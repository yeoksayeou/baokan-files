Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th -- Sanming Chemical Plant in Fujian Province has recently succeeded in using anthracite coal to replace coke in smelting calcium carbide, providing new experience for producing calcium carbide in greater quantities, faster, better, and more economically. According to calculations, using anthracite coal to smelt calcium carbide can save about 35% of raw material costs compared to using coke.

Calcium carbide is an important raw material for manufacturing nitrogenous fertilizers, synthetic resins, synthetic rubber, synthetic acetic acid, carbon black, and various other organic chemical industrial products. This product has traditionally been smelted with coke (sometimes mixed with one-third anthracite coal) and limestone in electric furnaces with strong heating, consuming seventy-five catties of coke for every one hundred catties of calcium carbide produced. In the process of building the factory and simultaneously engaging in production, the workers and staff of Sanming Chemical Plant, under the leadership of the Party committee, adopted a method of gradually increasing the proportion of anthracite coal until all coke was replaced with anthracite coal in smelting calcium carbide, achieving a high level of production, quality, and low consumption.

At present, relevant departments in Fujian Province have planned to promote this new experience based on the advantageous conditions of abundant hydropower, anthracite coal, and limestone resources in Fujian, to further develop calcium carbide production in order to supply the needs of developing nitrogenous fertilizer and organic chemical industrial production both inside and outside the province.

    无烟煤代焦炭冶炼电石成功
    福建省推广三明化工厂的新经验
    新华社福州7日电　福建省三明化工厂最近用无烟煤代替焦炭冶炼电石成功，为多快好省地大量生产电石提供了新的经验。据计算，使用无烟煤冶炼电石，比用焦炭可以节省原料成本35％左右。
    电石是制造含氮肥料、合成树脂、合成橡胶、合成醋酸、炭黑等各种有机化学工业品的重要原料。这种产品历来都是用焦炭（有的也掺用三分之一的无烟煤）和石灰石在电炉中加强热冶炼的，每生产一百斤电石要消耗焦炭七十五斤。三明化工厂职工在一面建厂、一面生产中，在党委的领导下，采用逐步增加无烟煤比重，以至全部用无烟煤代替焦炭冶炼电石，并且达到高产优质低耗的水平。
    现在，福建省有关部门已根据福建水电和无烟煤、石灰石资源丰富的有利条件，有计划地推广这一新的经验，进一步发展电石生产，以供应省内外发展含氮肥料和有机化学工业生产的需要。
