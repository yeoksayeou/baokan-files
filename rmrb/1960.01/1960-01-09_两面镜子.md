    Two Mirrors
    Wang Pu
    The paths taken by the Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory and the Shanghai Jingye Machinery Factory in their technical revolution are two mirrors. They tell us from two angles, with the most vivid facts, what attitude should be taken towards the mass technical revolution and what attitude should not be taken.
    In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, both the Construction Machinery Factory and the Jingye Machinery Factory were known throughout the country for their large-scale technical innovations in creating indigenous machine tools. The leading comrades of the Construction Machinery Factory deeply felt from the practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 that the indigenous machine tools produced in the mass technical innovation movement had the advantages of simple structure, easy manufacture, light weight, low cost, and flexible and convenient use. Manufacturing and using indigenous machine tools was a good way to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results under existing material conditions. Therefore, last year they continued to adhere to the spirit of self-reliance and insisted on the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods. Some people wanted to blow a cold wind and sweep away the indigenous machine tools, but they displayed their "ant army" and turned the special-purpose indigenous machine tools into multi-purpose indigenous machine tools, allowing the "ants" to spread their wings and fly high, improving the indigenous machine tools. As a result, the mass movement was always vigorous and production steadily increased. In the second quarter of last year, the Jingye Machinery Factory, because individual leading comrades opposed anything with the word "indigenous," not only did indigenous machine tools not develop, but some of the indigenous machine tools that had once created miracles for them were also relegated to the cold palace. The workers' enthusiastic zeal was doused with cold water, and technical innovation suggestions were rejected one by one. As a result, production showed a small "saddle shape," and they almost failed to complete the annual production plan. Two attitudes, two results, the contrast is extremely stark.
    Why do some people deeply feel the benefits of the word "indigenous," while others oppose it? Is it that the comrades of the Construction Machinery Factory have a special fondness for "indigenous" things and have no interest in foreign things? Of course not. Who wouldn't like tall factory buildings with brand new modern equipment installed? To establish modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense is the goal of our people's struggle in the 1960s. We should actively use modern equipment wherever conditions permit, and there is no disagreement about this. The question is, what should enterprises do if the conditions are not temporarily available? One way is to rely solely on state investment, sit and wait for modern equipment to arrive, wait one year if it doesn't come, wait two years if it doesn't come, and wait three years if it doesn't come, preferring to leave the new factory buildings empty rather than use the simple equipment created by the masses. Another way is to combine state investment with self-reliance, with self-reliance as the main focus, relying on the masses to build simple equipment on a large scale, and then gradually improve it, from indigenous to foreign. Which of these two methods can achieve modernization faster? Of course, the latter. Our country is so large, and there are so many departments and enterprises that need to be equipped with modern technology, that it is impossible to equip them all with modern equipment all at once. If everyone sits and waits for the state to allocate equipment, it will certainly not be fast. Taking self-reliance as the main focus, relying on the masses to build simple equipment on a large scale according to the needs of production development will not only not hinder the gradual use of modern equipment, but on the contrary, because the development of simple equipment can increase the country's material and technical strength, it is creating the best conditions for accelerating the modernization of the entire national economy.
    Moreover, the boundaries between indigenous (simple) and foreign (modern), from a developmental point of view, are only relative. What is foreign today will become indigenous tomorrow; what is indigenous today, some may be eliminated, while others may become foreign tomorrow. Because simple equipment, although generally speaking is relatively low-level, it is explored by the broad masses from long-term practice, not only has the special characteristic of adapting to local conditions, but also contains countless rays of truth in its simplicity. Some of their principles (such as building block machine tools in the machinery industry, the principle of "ants gnawing at bones") are not necessarily worse than foreign methods. Some may be relatively inefficient now, but can be completely improved after renovation. The coexistence of complex technology and simple technology, the mutual supplementation of foreign technology and locally created technology, exists at any time and in any society, but they have different contents in different historical development stages. Therefore, it is wrong to deny that indigenous and simple equipment and technology can play an important and positive role under certain conditions. Especially now, actively adopting and improving indigenous and simple equipment and technology is the correct path for many enterprises to accelerate modernization, and it is also the correct path for many enterprises to achieve sustained leap forward, and a negative attitude must not be taken.
    In order to ensure the sustained leap forward of production, the original indigenous equipment and simple equipment need to be constantly developed and improved. The experience of the Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory proves that indigenous machine tools, "ants gnawing at bones," etc., can all be improved. Many enterprises, workshops, and processes that are still manually operated are carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution in a big way in order to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and will create many simple equipment. The creations of the workers in technical innovation and technical revolution must be actively supported. This is the lesson that the two factories in Shanghai have given us.

    两面镜子
    王朴
    上海建设机器厂和上海精业机器厂技术革命所经历的道路，是两面镜子。它们从两个角度以最生动的事实告诉我们，对待群众技术革命的创举应该采取什么样的态度，不应该采取什么样的态度。
    建设机器厂和精业机器厂在1958年的大跃进中，都以大搞技术革新创造土机床而齐名全国。建设机器厂的领导同志从1958年大跃进的实践中，深深地感到在群众性的技术革新运动中所产生的土机床具有结构简单、制造容易、重量轻、成本低、使用起来灵活方便等优点，制造和使用土机床是在现有物质条件下实现多快好省的好办法。因此，他们去年继续本着自力更生的精神，坚持土洋并举的方针。有些人想吹一口冷风把土机床刮掉，他们却大摆其“蚂蚁阵”，把专用土机床变为多用土机床，让“蚂蚁”展翅高飞，把土机床提高了，因而群众运动始终蓬蓬勃勃，生产步步高升。精业机器厂在去年第二季度，因为个别领导同志见了“土”字就反对，土机床不但没有发展，连有些曾经为他们创造奇迹的土机床也被打进了冷宫。职工群众的满腔热情被一瓢瓢冷水浇着，技术革新建议被逐条否定，结果生产出现了小“马鞍形”，险些没完成全年生产计划。两种态度，两种结果，对照鲜明极了。
    为什么有人见了“土”字就深深感到它的好处，有人见了“土”字就反对呢？难道建设机器厂的同志特别嗜好“土”的东西，对于洋的东西没一点兴趣吗？当然不是。高大的厂房，安装着全新的现代设备，谁见了不喜欢？建立现代化工业、现代化农业、现代化科学文化、现代化国防，这是我国人民在二十世纪六十年代的奋斗目标。凡是有条件使用现代设备的，我们都要积极使用，这是没有异议的。问题是条件暂时不具备的企业怎么办？单纯依靠国家投资，坐等现代设备降临，一年不来等二年，二年不来等三年，宁可让新厂房空着，也不愿使用群众创造的简易设备，这是一种办法。国家投资和自力更生相结合，以自力更生为主，依靠群众大造简易设备，然后逐步提高，从土到洋，这是另一种办法。这两种办法哪一种能更快地实现现代化？当然是后一种。我们的国家这么大，需要用现代技术装备的部门，企业那么多，不可能一下都用现代化的设备全部装备起来，大家都坐等国家调拨设备，必不能快。以自力更生为主，根据生产发展的需要，依靠群众大搞简易设备，不但不会妨碍逐步使用现代设备，而且相反，由于发展简易设备能够增加国家的物质技术力量，正是为加速整个国民经济现代化创造最好的条件。
    而且，土（简易的）和洋（现代的）的界限，从发展观点看，只是相对的。今日之洋，会转变为明日之土；今日之土，一部分可能被淘汰，另一部分却可能变为明日之洋。因为简易设备，虽然一般说来比较低级，但是，它是广大群众从长期的实践中摸索出来的，不仅有因地制宜的特长，而且简易之中也蕴藏着无数真理的霞光。它们的某些原理（例如机械工业中积木式机床、“蚂蚁啃骨头”的原理）并不见得比洋法差。有的现在虽然效率比较低，但经过改造，是完全可以提高的。复杂的技术和简单的技术并存，外来技术和本地创造技术互相补充，这在任何时候，任何社会中都是存在着的，只是在不同的历史发展阶段，它们具有不同的内容而已。所以否认土的简易的设备和技术在一定条件下能起重要的积极作用，是不对的。特别在现在，积极采用和提高土的简易的设备和技术，更是许许多多企业加速现代化的正确道路，也是许许多多企业实现持续跃进的正确道路，更不能采取否定的态度。
    为了保证生产的持续跃进，原有的土设备，简易设备，需要不断的发展和提高。上海建设机器厂的经验证明，土机床“蚂蚁啃骨头”等等，都是可以提高的。许多现在还是手工操作的企业、车间、工序，为了实现今年的更好更全面跃进，职工群众正在大搞技术革新和技术革命，还会创造很多简易设备。对职工群众在技术革新和技术革命中的创举，必须积极支持，这就是上海两个工厂给我们的教益。
