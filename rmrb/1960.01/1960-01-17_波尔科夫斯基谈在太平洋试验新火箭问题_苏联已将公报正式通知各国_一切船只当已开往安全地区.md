Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency on the 15th: Soviet Deputy Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Maritime Transport, Bolkovsky, at the request of the editorial department of the Warsaw Workers' News Agency, spoke about the Soviet Union's upcoming test of a powerful rocket in the Pacific Ocean.

In response to the editorial department's question as to whether all foreign vessels had left the test area, Bolkovsky said that the deadline set by the Soviet Union began on January 15th, so it is difficult to say whether the area referred to in the communiqué is completely free of ships. Bolkovsky believes that ships located in this area have sailed to safety.

Bolkovsky pointed out that when the United States and Britain conducted tests in the Pacific, Soviet ships were also advised to leave dangerous locations.

Bolkovsky went on to point out that the United States and Britain were the first to conduct nuclear tests on the high seas. The tests by the US and Britain were military in nature, unlike the Soviet Union's, which are scientific tests. The United States and Britain issued notices of their tests through the shipping system. The Soviet Ministry of Maritime Transport only learned about this from the newspapers, while the Soviet government first published the TASS communiqué, and then notified the governments of various countries through diplomatic channels. Therefore, the Soviet Union obtained the guarantee that the governments of the countries concerned would notify all ships of the Soviet Union's rocket test.

    波尔科夫斯基谈在太平洋试验新火箭问题
    苏联已将公报正式通知各国
    一切船只当已开往安全地区
    新华社16日讯　据波兰通讯社15日消息：苏联海运部副总监察员波尔科夫斯基应华沙工人通讯社编辑部的请求，谈到了苏联即将在太平洋试验强力火箭的问题。
    波尔科夫斯基在回答编辑部提出的关于所有的外国船只是否都已经离开了试验地区时说，苏联指定的期限是从1月15日开始，因此很难说公报中所指的地区是否已经完全没有船只了。波尔科夫斯基认为位于这个地区的船只已开往安全的地方去了。
    波尔科夫斯基指出，美国和英国在太平洋进行试验时，苏联船只也曾被劝告离开危险地点。
    波尔科夫斯基接着指出，首先在公海举行核试验的是美国和英国。美英的试验是军事性的，而不像苏联那样是科学性的试验的。美国和英国是通过航运系统发出要进行试验的通知的。苏联海运部从报纸上才知道这件事，而苏联政府首先发表了塔斯社公报，接着又通过外交途径通知了各国政府。因此，苏联就得到了这样的保证：各有关国家政府将把苏联要试验火箭的事情通知所有船只。
