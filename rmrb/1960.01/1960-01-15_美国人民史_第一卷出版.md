	First Volume of "A People's History of the United States" Published

	Herbert Aptheker, the famous American Black historian, has recently written a twelve-volume "A People's History of the United States." The first volume, "The Colonial Era," was published in 1959 by International Publishers in New York. The publication of "The Colonial Era" immediately attracted the attention of academic circles in the United States and other countries. The CPUSA's "Political Affairs" and "Mainstream," the CPC's "Marxist Review," and the Soviet Union's "Problems of History" have all published articles highly praising this work. William Z. Foster, Honorary Chairman of the CPUSA, wrote in "Political Affairs" that the beginning publication of "A People's History of the United States" is "a major event in the cultural world." "Now, the working class and its allies...will have a history of their own."

	Currently in the United States, the vast majority of works on American history are full of errors and biases. Therefore, the publication of Aptheker's "A People's History of the United States" has great political significance and academic value.

	The most important feature of "The Colonial Era" is that the author narrates the difficult lives and tragic fates of Blacks, Indians, and whites at that time, discusses the Black uprisings, Indian resistance, and workers' strikes, and emphasizes the decisive role they played in the course of American history.

	The remaining volumes of "A People's History of the United States" are also written around various periods and major events in American history, discussing the historical facts from the "Revolutionary Period" of 1763-1783 to 1952. (Hu Xi)

    “美国人民史”第一卷出版
    美国著名黑人史学家赫伯特·阿普特克，新近编写了一部十二卷本的“美国人民史”。其第一卷——“殖民地时期”，已经在1959年由纽约国际出版社出版。“殖民地时期”一书出版后，立即引起了美国以及其他国家学术界的重视。美共的“政治评论”和“主流”、加共的“马克思主义评论”以及苏联的“历史问题”都发表文章，对这部著作给予了很高的评价。美共名誉主席福斯特在“政治评论”上写道：“美国人民史”的开始出版，是“文化界的一件大事”。“现在，工人阶级和它的同盟军……将拥有一部他们自己的历史”。
    目前在美国，关于美国史的著作绝大部分都充满了错误和偏见。因此，阿普特克的“美国人民史”的问世，具有极大的政治意义和学术价值。
    “殖民地时期”最主要的特点在于：作者叙述了当时黑人、印第安人和白人的困苦生活和悲惨命运，论述了黑人的起义、印第安人的反抗和工人的罢工，并着重指出了他们在美国历史进程中所起的决定作用。
    “美国人民史”的其余各卷也都是围绕着美国历史上各个时期和重大事件编写的，对从1763—1783年“革命时期”至1952年的史实作了论述。（虎溪）
