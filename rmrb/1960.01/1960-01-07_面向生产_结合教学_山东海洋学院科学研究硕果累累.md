Facing Production, Integrating with Teaching
Shandong Ocean College Achieves Fruitful Scientific Research Results

    (Our report) Shandong Ocean College, in its scientific research work, has achieved great accomplishments in the past year due to strengthening the Party's leadership, vigorously carrying out mass movements, facing production, and integrating with teaching.

    Shandong Ocean College is the only multidisciplinary ocean university in our country. Under the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward situation, the college's scientific research work closely integrates with teaching and current production and construction. In the past year, it has completed a total of 237 research projects and compiled 46 kinds of teaching materials. Among them, 37 items have been combined with teaching and compiled into teaching materials or teaching reference books, such as the "Preliminary Analysis of the Yellow and East China Sea Current Systems" by the Department of Marine Hydrology and Meteorology, the "Migration of Cuttlefish" by the Department of Marine Biology, and the "Experiments on the Prevention and Treatment of Fish Diseases with Mercuric Nitrate and Copper Sulfate" by the Department of Aquaculture, achieving scientific research serving teaching and enriching the teaching materials. In addition, 16 scientific research achievements, such as the "Analysis of Precipitation and Weather Patterns along the Jiaozhou Bay Coast in 1957" and the "Lightweight Tide Gauge" by the Department of Marine Hydrology and Meteorology, the "Strong Acid and Strong Alkaline Ion Exchangers" by the Department of Marine Chemistry, and the "Stern Engine" by the Department of Aquaculture, have been adopted by production units such as the Qingdao Salt Bureau and chemical factories and put into production. In the past year, the college has also cooperated with more than ten units, including the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute, to carry out scientific research.

    The fundamental reasons for the significant achievements of Shandong Ocean College in scientific research over the past year are the Party's leadership and the vigorous mass movement. The college Party committee has specially established a scientific and technological leadership group, and the college administration has established a scientific research committee. The Party committee's meetings also frequently discuss scientific research work. Also, due to boldly mobilizing the masses and vigorously carrying out mass movements, teachers and students proposed hundreds of scientific research projects in a very short period of time, worked hard and skillfully, and achieved great results. All teachers participated in scientific research activities, and most of the third and fourth-year students also participated. The school also incorporated scientific research work into the education plan and arranged scientific research work in conjunction with production internships and graduation theses.

    面向生产　结合教学
    山东海洋学院科学研究硕果累累
    本报讯　山东海洋学院在科学研究工作中，由于加强了党的领导，大搞群众运动，面向生产、结合教学，一年来获得了很大成就。
    山东海洋学院是我国唯一的一所多科性海洋高等学校。在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，这个学院的科学研究工作密切结合教学和当前生产建设，一年来总共完成了二百三十七个研究项目，编写出讲义四十六种。其中已经结合教学编写成讲义或教学参考书的有海洋水文气象系的“黄东海流系统的初步分析”、海洋生物系的“乌贼的回游”、水产系的“硝酸亚汞及硫酸铜防治鱼病的试验”等三十七项，做到了科学研究为教学服务，充实了教材。此外，海洋水文气象系的“1957年胶州湾沿岸降水量与天气型式的分析”、“轻便验潮仪”，海洋化学系的“强酸、强碱性离子交换剂”，水产系的“船尾机”等十六项科学研究成果，已经分别被青岛市的盐务局、化工厂等生产单位采纳投入生产。一年来，这个学院还同中国科学院海洋研究所、黄海水产研究所等十多个单位协作进行科学研究。
    一年来山东海洋学院科学研究取得重大成绩的根本原因，是党的领导和大搞群众运动。院党委专门成立了科学技术领导小组，学院行政成立了科学研究委员会，在党委的会议上也经常讨论科学研究工作。还由于放手发动了群众，大搞群众运动，师生们在很短的时期内，就提出了成百的科学研究项目，苦干巧干，取得了很大成绩。教师们全部都参加了科学研究活动，三四年级大部分学生也都参加。学校并把科学研究工作纳入了教育计划，结合生产实习、毕业论文安排科学研究工作。
