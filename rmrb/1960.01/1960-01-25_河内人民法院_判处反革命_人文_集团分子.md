Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Hanoi People's Court has tried members of the counter-revolutionary "Nhan Van" group.

This group engaged in sabotage activities in Hanoi and other places, and during the period of 1956-1958, under the guise of engaging in literary and artistic activities (this group published the reactionary magazines "Nhan Van" and "Giai Pham" in 1956), conducted psychological warfare against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In April 1958, this counter-revolutionary group was uncovered and its members were arrested.

These spies all confessed to their crimes during the trial. The heads of this group, Nguyen Huu Dang and Liu Thi Yen (also known as Thuy An) (female), were each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, followed by five years of deprivation of political rights. In addition, Minh Duc and two others were sentenced to five to ten years of imprisonment, followed by five or three years of deprivation of political rights.

The defendants confessed that this counter-revolutionary group was operating at the same time as a group of American and Ngo Dinh Diem spies who had been tried earlier by the Hanoi People's Court and were active in North Vietnam. They all belonged to a spy group led by the United States and headed by Tran Minh Chau, which was uncovered in early November 1958 in the three cities of Hanoi, Haiphong, and Nam Dinh.

    河内人民法院
    判处反革命“人文”集团分子
    新华社河内电　据越南通讯社20日报道：河内人民法院审判了反革命的“人文”集团分子。
    这个集团在河内等地进行破坏活动，并在1956—1958年期间，披着从事文艺活动的外衣（这个集团曾在1956年出版反动的“人文”、“佳品”杂志）进行反对越南民主共和国的心理战。1958年4月，这个反革命集团被破获，成员被逮捕。
    这些间谍都在审讯中承认了他们的罪行。这个集团的首脑阮友当和刘氏燕（又名瑞安）（女）各被判处十五年徒刑，刑满后褫夺公权五年。另外明德等三人被判决五年至十年徒刑，刑满后褫夺公权五年或三年。
    被告们供认，这个反革命集团是同早些时候被河内人民法院审判过的曾在越南北方活动的一批美国和吴庭艳间谍同时进行活动的。他们都属于以陈明珠为首的由美国领导的一个间谍集团，这个集团在1958年11月初在河内、海防和南定等三个城市被破获。
