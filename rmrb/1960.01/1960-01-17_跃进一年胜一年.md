Diary of a Party Secretary

	Leap Forward Year After Year
	Wang Fenggui, Second Secretary of the CPC Fuyang Prefectural Committee of Anhui Province

We bid farewell to the great leap forward, the victorious 1959 with excitement. Under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, we didn't stop and kept on the go, stepping into a new era of continued leap forward amidst the gongs and drums of continued leap forward and welcoming a flying start. On the thousands of miles of plains in northern Anhui, tens of thousands of heroic men and women on the water conservancy front in Fuyang Prefecture are welcoming the New Year and embarking on a new journey. Although it is now the coldest period of winter, the weather is freezing, how can the cold wind restrain people's soaring energy? Dear comrades, please come to our Fuyang area and take a look at these heroes who are fighting the severe cold and challenging the frozen ground with high spirits, full of enthusiasm for their selfless labor in order to realize river network construction. If you ask: Where does their energy come from? That is because they deeply understand that river network construction plants the roots of happiness for the people.

River network construction, what a beautiful word! It is like a bird of happiness, descending into the world with the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune like the rising sun. With it, the disasters of "major floods in heavy rain, minor floods in light rain, and drought in no rain" in the past in Fuyang area have been sent away; with it, the people of Fuyang area have been freed from the long-term poverty of being poorly clothed and unfed. Listen! The people sincerely sing praises to river network construction like this:

	With river network construction,
	We are not afraid of drought or flood,
	A bumper harvest is guaranteed,
	Happiness for thousands of families.

The river network construction project started in the winter of 1957. At that time, the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee put forward the task of "river network construction, rice cultivation, and transforming northern Anhui into Jiangnan" to us. The Party's call, like spring thunder, resounded throughout the vast wilderness and stirred up thousands of troops. From south to north, from east to west, all over the sky and all over the land, where there are no water conservancy construction teams! After a hard winter and spring, although it is only a preliminary river network, it has already shown its great power last year. Under the severe drought that lasted for more than three months in the summer, it guaranteed the water use of 2.9 million mu of rice and more than 14 million mu of spring and summer dry-land grain crops, making the crops lush and green, and achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. The rice harvest season has arrived, and reports of large-scale high-yield production spread frequently. As soon as Wangshi People's Commune in Fuyang County announced the good news of a large-scale high-yield of more than 26,000 mu of rice with an average yield of 1,516 jin per mu, Chengji People's Commune created a miracle of more than 30,000 mu of rice with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu, including 130 mu with a yield of more than 3,000 jin per mu; 26 mu with a yield of more than 5,400 jin per mu; and even 1.1 mu reaching a peak of more than 8,600 jin. The general line, the great leap forward, the people's commune, river network construction, and rice improvement have made the agricultural output of the entire region soar, transforming from a well-known grain-deficient area into a surplus grain area. The tails of the "tidal-watching faction" and "pessimists" are clamped up, and the broad masses of people smile and celebrate the harvest, singing happy songs:

	River network construction is powerful,
	It can withstand the greatest disasters,
	Even if the heavens do not rain,
	Even if the Dragon King turns the ocean upside down.

	On both sides of the river, on both sides of the road,
	Orchards and trees in thousands of rows,
	Millions of fish are produced in the river,
	Millions of seedlings can be planted around.

	The fish are fat, the rice is fragrant,
	Willows hang on the river surface,
	Everyone says the scenery of Jiangnan is good,
	Our home has become a land of fish and rice.

Fuyang Prefecture, located in the plains of northern Anhui, has initially realized river network construction. It is like a giant, breaking free from the shackles of drought and flood natural disasters and restoring its beauty and youth. Now it is full of crisscrossing rivers and green water everywhere. In the spring, the fields are green, in the summer, it is golden, a sea of wheat and rice waves, green waves and golden waves, leap forward songs are all over the fields, livestock is prosperous, and people live long and harvest years.

River network construction has brought great changes to Fuyang area, but the people have even more beautiful ideals: to completely realize river network construction and leap to become Jiangnan. Now it is only the beginning of 1960, and 1.68 million water conservancy troops have already rushed to the front line. The cold wind on the construction site shakes ten thousand red flags, and the heroes are all vying to be first. The backward tools of carrying and lifting have been eliminated, and replaced by rotating earth-moving machines, trestle-style earth-moving machines, giant dump trucks, leap forward "tanks"... The cold wind and rain cannot defeat the heroes. Look at the earth-shattering momentum of their soaring energy, listen to the earth-shattering vows: guarantee to complete the task of 100 million cubic meters of earthwork this year ahead of schedule, meet the water needs of 6 million mu of rice and other dry-land grain crops for winter irrigation and spring watering, and win a greater bumper harvest to report good news to Chairman Mao. Ah! What a heroic spirit. If you want to know what kind of people these heroes are, listen to their battle song:

	We must be as strong as nature,
	Not afraid of the cold wind and snow,
	Realize river network construction as soon as possible,
	What if we dig a Yangtze River?

If you want to know the heroes' revolutionary optimism, listen to the following folk song:

	Big green shoes, embroidered with red flowers,
	Sister puts them on to dig the river,
	Wading in the water, stepping in the mud,
	The flower shoes are stepped into mud lumps.
	Little sister says:
	"Sister, sister, take them off,
	Mom will beat you if you step on the flower shoes."
	Sister says:
	"Mom beats me, I'm not afraid,
	Who cares about building water conservancy,
	When river network construction is realized,
	We'll make new shoes and embroider flowers."

In front of such heroes, what is there to fear about the greatest difficulties! Yes, completing the task is not easy, we have to jump to pick the fruit. The heroes work hard and skillfully, reform tools to improve efficiency, and set off a high-efficiency movement, catching up with each other, in full swing. Yesterday you were the first, today I am leading again, tomorrow? Who dares to make a conclusion?

This is the great spring light that 1960 has brought to Fuyang area. The leap forward situation in the new year is infinitely good. Let us go all out, forge ahead bravely, and sing loudly:

	Open your throat and sing praises to river networks,
	Welcome the New Year to the world,
	Riding the wind and waves thousands of miles a day,
	Leap forward year after year.

    跃进一年胜一年
    中共安徽阜阳地委第二书记　王丰桂
    我们满怀着兴奋的心情，送走了大跃进的、胜利的1959年。在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，我们马不停蹄，人不离鞍，在继续跃进、迎接开门红的锣鼓中，跨进了继续跃进的新的年代。在淮北的千里平原上，阜阳专区水利战线上成千上万英勇的健儿们，迎接着新年，又踏上新的征途。虽然眼下正是数九寒天，天寒地冻，但是，冷风怎能抑制住人们冲天的干劲呢？亲爱的同志们，请你们到我们阜阳地区来看一看吧，来看看这些英雄们为了实现河网化，正威风凛凛地挺起胸脯，跟严寒搏斗，向冻地挑战，热情洋溢地进行着忘我的劳动。你若是问：他们的干劲从何而来？那就是因为他们深深地懂得河网化给人民栽下了幸福根。
    河网化，多么美好的词儿啊！它像一只幸福鸟，随着总路线、大跃进和犹如旭日东升的人民公社降临人间。有了它，送走了阜阳地区过去“大雨大灾、小雨小灾、不雨旱灾”的祸患；有了它，阜阳地区人民摆脱了长期衣不蔽体、食不果腹的贫困生活。听吧！人民对河网化是这样衷心地歌颂着：
    有了河网化，
    旱涝都不怕，
    丰收有保证，
    幸福千万家。
    河网化的工程是从1957年冬开始的。当时党中央和省委给我们提出了“河网化，水稻化，变淮北为江南”的任务。党的号召，如同春雷，响遍了辽阔的原野，引动了千军万马。从南到北，从东到西，漫天遍野，哪里没有兴修水利的队伍啊！大干了一个冬春，虽然仅是初具规模的河网化，去年已经显示了它的巨大威力。在夏季旱情持续了三个多月的特大旱灾下，它保证了二百九十万亩水稻和一千四百多万亩春夏种旱粮作物的用水，使庄稼一片葱绿，获得了空前的大丰收。水稻收获的季节到了，大面积高额丰产的捷报频传。阜阳县王市人民公社刚传出了两万六千多亩水稻平均亩产一千五百一十六斤大面积高额丰产的喜讯，程集人民公社又创三万多亩水稻亩产千斤以上的奇迹，其中有一百三十亩亩产三千多斤；二十六亩亩产五千四百多斤；更有一亩一分登上八千六百多斤高峰。总路线、大跃进、人民公社、河网化、稻改化，使全区农业产量扶摇直上，由闻名的缺粮专区，一跃而为余粮专区。“观潮派”“悲观论”者的尾巴夹起来了，广大人民笑逐颜开，喜庆丰收，唱出了愉快的歌声：
    河网化，力量强，
    天大灾害能抵挡，
    那怕老天不下雨，
    那怕龙王翻海洋。
    河两岸，路两旁，
    果木园林树千行，
    河中产鱼千万尾，
    周围能栽万亩秧。
    鱼儿肥，稻花香，
    杨柳垂在河面上，
    都说江南风光好，
    咱家已变鱼米乡。
    地居淮北平原的阜阳专区，由于初步实现了河网化，它像一个巨人一样，挣脱了旱涝自然灾害的枷锁，恢复了它的美貌青春。现在到处是河网纵横，绿水盈盈。春天原野一片葱绿，夏天一片金黄，麦海稻浪，碧波金涛，跃进歌声遍野，六畜兴旺，人寿年丰。
    河网化给阜阳地区带来了巨变，但人民还有更为美好的理想：彻底实现河网化，飞跃变江南。现在才是1960年的开始，而一百六十八万水利大军，早已开赴前线。工地上寒风摇动着万面红旗，英雄们个个争先，挑抬的落后工具淘汰了，代替上阵的是转马运土器、天桥式运土器、巨型斗车、跃进“坦克”……。寒风冷雨难不倒英雄汉，你看那排山倒海的冲天干劲，你听那惊天动地的誓言：保证提前完成今年一亿公方工程的任务，满足六百万亩水稻和其他旱粮作物冬灌春浇的用水，夺取更大丰收，向毛主席报喜。啊！这是多么豪壮的英雄气概。要知这些英雄们是何等人物，且听他们的战歌：
    要与自然比刚强，
    不怕风雪刺骨凉，
    早日实现河网化，
    挖条长江又何妨。
    要想知道英雄们革命的乐观精神，且听下面这首民歌：
    大绿鞋，绣红花，
    姐姐穿上把河挖，
    水里趟，泥里踏，
    花鞋踏成泥疙瘩。
    妹妹说：
    “姐姐姐姐脱了吧，
    踏坏花鞋妈妈打。”
    姐姐说：
    “妈妈打，我不怕，
    兴修水利谁顾它，
    等到实现河网化，
    又做新鞋又绣花。”
    在这样的英雄面前，天大的困难，又何足怕！是的，完成任务，并不是易如反掌的，跳一跳才能把果子摘下来。英雄苦干又巧干，改革工具提高工效，掀起了高工效运动，你追我赶，热火朝天。昨天还是你第一，今天又是我领先，明天吗？又有何人敢下断言？
    这就是1960年为阜阳地区带来的大好春光。新的一年的跃进形势无限好。让我们鼓足干劲，奋勇前进，高声歌唱：
    放开喉咙颂河网，
    迎接新年到人间，
    乘风破浪日千里，
    跃进一年胜一年。
