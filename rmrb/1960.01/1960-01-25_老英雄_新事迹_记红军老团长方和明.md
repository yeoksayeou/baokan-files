Fang Heming, a nationally renowned Red Army veteran regimental commander, is now the Party Branch Secretary of the Bayi Production Team in the Qiliping Commune, Hong'an County. This battle-tested old hero, although nearing sixty, still shines with the noble qualities of the Red Army in leading production and has created many new achievements.

**Putting "Early" First**

Doing things early rather than late is a good habit that Fang Heming cultivated when he was a Red Army regimental commander. Now, he often uses this spirit to lead production and work. Because time is gained, the work is always proactive.

Last spring, while still transplanting seedlings, he considered the next step: how to reasonably implement close planting. At that time, some commune members did not fully recognize the benefits of close planting. To help commune members improve their understanding and prepare for reasonable close planting, he fully mobilized the Party and Youth League organizations while also going deep into the masses to seek advice from farmers and friends, soliciting commune members' opinions on reasonable close planting. One day, veteran farmer Wang Guanghua told him that, based on his many years of experience, the soil was fertile, the rice tillers would be large, and it was not advisable to plant too densely, so it should be planted at five by six inches; soil of general quality should be planted at five by five inches; soil of poor quality, the rice tillers would be small, and it should not be sparse, so it could be planted at four by five inches. After listening, Fang Heming felt it made sense and immediately convened a veteran farmer forum to discuss Wang Guanghua's opinion. It turned out that Wang Guanghua, when farming in the past, due to the large population and little land, wanted to produce more grain, so he planted seedlings more densely than anyone else. After many years of exploration, he gained this experience. The veteran farmers praised him and agreed with this approach.

When transplanting began, Fang Heming personally selected two paddy fields with different soil qualities, first conducting experiments, and then convening cadres at the fields to hold an on-site meeting to promote it. He also paid close attention to the seedling transplanting situation of the commune members. He discovered that commune member Yu Baolong was still planting sparsely as before, so he convened commune members to conduct a debate in the field. This debate not only educated Yu Baolong but also educated other commune members, and reasonable close planting was quickly implemented.

**Going into Battle While Sick**

By early July, the large ponds and small weirs of the Bayi Production Team had been sucked dry by the drought demon. The elderly Fang Heming actively led the commune members to fight the drought. When the weirs and ponds dried up, he mobilized the commune members to find springs and dig wells; when the wells and springs dried up, he led the commune members to draw water from the Qiliping River, five or six miles away, turning the water over mountains and ridges to bring it to the fields. In the tense days of fighting the drought, he fought alongside the commune members.

When the drought struggle entered its most intense stage, the water in the Qiliping River was also drawn dry. People turned over the mud and sand on the riverbed to draw out the groundwater and then transport it to the fields. While pumping water, someone suddenly exclaimed, "Regimental Commander Fang is not well!" When the commune members heard this shout, they immediately ran over to rescue Fang Heming, who had fainted on the ground. After the health worker gave Fang Heming emergency medicine, he slowly regained consciousness. After repeated questioning by the health worker, Fang Heming said that he had "skin chills" (malaria). It turned out that he had been sick for several days. But he had insisted on working with the commune members. On this day, when he began to feel cold, he desperately thought, "Pumping water requires more exercise, sweating will drive away the cold." Unexpectedly, the wound on his right chest, which had been stabbed by the enemy, also flared up at this time due to overwork, so he could not persevere.

After regaining consciousness, the health worker was about to help him go home to rest, when he suddenly heard a commune member say, "The water source is getting smaller and smaller, what will we do next?" These words immediately alerted him: "Yes, at this critical moment of severe drought, the masses will lose confidence in fighting the drought without the leadership of the Party. The Party sent me to lead the commune members to fight the drought, I have no right to leave my post." Thinking of this, he was full of energy, completely forgetting his illness. When the health worker urged him to go back to rest quickly, he resolutely replied: "The enemy's guns and cannons did not kill me, can this little illness wear me down!" He continued to persevere with the commune members to fight the drought to the end. After nearly a hundred days of effort by the commune members, they finally overcame the drought that had not been seen in a century, enabling most of the fields to maintain their yields, with only a small portion of the fields with poor water conservancy conditions experiencing reduced yields.

**Do as Ma XueLi does**

In November last year, Fang Heming visited industrial construction in Wuhan and met Ma XueLi, a representative attending the National Congress of Heroes. Ma XueLi is an adjuster at the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory and a red banner pacesetter for technical innovation in Hubei Province. In technical innovation, he closely relies on the Party and the masses, and promotes the communist style of stepping forward in the face of difficulties, yielding honors, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward. Fang Heming was very excited after listening to Ma XueLi's introduction of advanced deeds and resolved to do as Ma XueLi did after returning to the commune.

On the day he returned to the team from Wuhan, it was raining heavily. Before he had even entered his house, he heard commune members telling him that the water in the reservoir was about to overflow the embankment. Without saying a word, he put down his luggage and rushed to the reservoir to deal with the emergency, not even having time to grab rain gear. After the reservoir was saved, the commune members asked him: "You just came back from Wuhan, why didn't you rest and instead worked hard in the rain?" He replied: "The workers are very energetic, we must work harder and learn from the workers." Then, he explained in detail Ma XueLi's advanced deeds to the commune members. After listening to his introduction, the commune members all said: "We must also do as Ma XueLi does." That night, the Bayi Production Team's youth worked all night to repair handcarts, and the next day they used handcarts to transport soil, increasing work efficiency by more than two times. Fang Heming actively suggested that the headquarters manufacture bullock carts to transport soil, and he also transferred the team's carpenters and blacksmiths to the construction site to build carts. His actions deeply moved the commune members of other production teams, who also actively improved transportation tools, and within a few days the entire construction site was mechanized, greatly accelerating the speed of reservoir construction.

Fang Heming is never satisfied with his achievements. Not long ago, at the Hubei Provincial Conference of Activists of Demobilized and Transferred Military Personnel, he made new guarantees: to continue to maintain glory, promote glory, do as Ma XueLi does, always be a promoter of revolution, always be a vanguard in the Great Leap Forward, and work with the commune members to strive for an even greater agricultural harvest this year.

    老英雄  新事迹
    ——记红军老团长方和明
    新华社记者　蒋顺章
    全国著名的红军老团长方和明，现在是红安县七里坪公社八一生产队的党支部书记。这位身经百战的老英雄，虽然年近花甲，但在领导生产中依然闪烁着红军的高贵品质的光辉，创造了许多新的事迹。
    早字当先
    做事赶早不赶晚。是方和明当红军团长时就养成的好习惯。现在，他又经常以这种精神来领导生产和工作。因为争得了时间，就使工作步步主动。
    去年春天，还在下秧的时候，他就考虑下一步如何合理密植的问题。当时，有些社员对密植的好处认识不足，他为了帮助社员提高认识，做好合理密植的准备，就一面在党团组织内作充分动员，一面深入群众寻师访友，征求社员对合理密植的意见。一天，老农王光华告诉他，根据他多年的经验，土质肥的田发稞大，不宜过密，应栽五×六寸；土质一般的田栽五×五寸；土质差的田发稞小，不宜稀，可栽四×五寸。方和明听了以后觉得有道理，立即召开老农座谈会，讨论王光华的意见。原来王光华从前种田时，由于人多地少，想多打粮食，他栽的秧比谁都密。经过多年的摸索，才取得这些经验。老农们听后个个称赞，都同意这个做法。
    插秧开始，方和明亲自选择了两块土质不同的水田，先作试验，然后召集干部在田边开现场会议推广。他还十分注意社员的栽秧情况。他发现社员余宝龙还是照旧稀植，就召集社员在田边开展辩论。这场辩论不但教育了余宝龙，也教育了其他社员，合理密植很快就推行开了。
    抱病上阵
    7月初，八一生产队的大塘小堰都被旱魔吸干了。年迈的方和明积极领导社员抗旱，堰塘干了，就发动社员找泉挖井；井泉断了，就带领社员到五、六里路以外的七里坪大河上车水，翻山越岭把水引到田里。在紧张的抗旱日子里，他同社员们战斗在一起。
    抗旱斗争进入最紧张的时候，七里坪的河水也被车干了。人们在河床上翻开泥沙，把地下水引出来，再车到田去。正在车水的时候，忽然有人惊叫一声：“方团长不好啦！”社员们听到这声叫唤，都立即跑过来，抢救晕倒在地上的方和明。等保健员把急救药给方和明吃下后，他才慢慢苏醒过来。经保健员一再询问，方和明才说出自己打“皮寒”（疟疾）。原来几天前他就生病了。但他一直坚持和社员们一起干活。这天，当他开始感到冷时，他还拼命地想，车水多运动一下，出些汗，驱走寒冷。没想到，他右胸上被敌人刺伤的伤口，由于过分疲劳，这时候也发作了，因此坚持不了。
    苏醒过来以后，保健员正要扶他回家休息，忽听到一个社员说：“水源越来越少，再下去怎么办？”这话使他立即警觉到：“是啊，在这旱情严重的关头上，群众没有党的领导就会失去抗旱的信心。党派我领导社员抗旱，我没有权利离开岗位。”他想到这里，浑身是劲，完全忘了病痛。当保健员催促他赶快回去休息时，他坚决地回答说：“敌人的枪炮没有把我打死，这点小病就能把我磨死！”他继续同社员们在一起坚持抗旱到底。经过社员们将近一百天的努力，终于战胜了百年未遇的干旱，使大部分田地保住了产量，只有一小部分水利条件较差的田减产。
    照马学礼那样干
    去年11月间，方和明到武汉参观工业建设，会见了出席全国群英会的代表马学礼。马学礼是武汉重型机床厂的调整工，湖北省技术革新的红旗手。他在技术革新中，紧紧依靠党和群众，发扬了见困难就上、见荣誉就让、见先进就学、见后进就帮的共产主义风格。方和明听了马学礼的先进事迹介绍以后心里很激动，决心回社以后要照马学礼那样干。
    他从武汉回到队里的那天，天下大雨。他还没有走进家门，就听到社员告诉他：水库的水快要溢过堤了。他二话没说，放下行装，连雨具都没来得及取，拔脚就往水库去抢险。水库脱险后，社员们问他：“你从武汉回来怎么也不休息一下，就冒雨大干呢？”他回答说：“工人老大哥的干劲可大啦，我们要加油干，向老大哥学习。”接着，他详尽地把马学礼的先进事迹向社员们作了介绍。社员们听了他的介绍，个个表示：“我们也要照马学礼那样干。”当晚，八一生产队的青年连夜赶回队整修手推车，第二天用手推车运土，使工效提高了两倍多。方和明积极建议指挥部制造牛车运土，并把队里的木匠和铁匠都调来为工地造车。他的行动深深地感动了其他生产队的社员，也都积极改进运输工具，在短短的几天内整个工地就实现了车子化，大大地加快了水库建设的速度。
    方和明永不满足自己的成就。不久以前，他在湖北省复员、转业军人积极分子大会上，又提出了新的保证：继续保持光荣，发扬光荣，照马学礼那样干，永远当革命的促进派，永远做大跃进中的尖兵，同社员一道争取今年农业获得更大丰收。（附图片）
