    Warning to Those Who Lead the Wolves
    Lu Wei
    There is a Japanese proverb: "To lead a wolf into the house is to bring disaster to the entire house." However, it is Japan's Nobusuke Kishi who is acting as the guide, attempting to further introduce the American imperialist wolf into Japan through the signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty!
    The Japanese people will not forget the profound suffering and tragic consequences that the aggressive war launched by Japanese militarism brought to the Japanese people between the 1930s and 1940s. Today, the groans of the atomic bomb victims are still echoing in their ears, and the bloodstains of the Hiroshima victims are still fresh in their minds. How can the Japanese people not rise up and resist the heinous act of the Kishi Nobusuke government willingly acting as an accomplice to American aggression in the Far East, returning to the old path of war, and leading to the destruction of Japan? The Chinese people once suffered from the invasion and killing by Japanese imperialists, and fought against this ferocious enemy for more than ten years. Finally, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and after the Soviet Red Army participated in the Far East War, they finally defeated this mad beast. Today, how can we not wholeheartedly support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people?
    The Japanese people have already raised their iron fists. Look, a nationwide rally was held in Tokyo to oppose the signing of this military alliance treaty; people in Osaka, Kobe, Fukuoka and other places have gathered and demonstrated to oppose the signing of this military alliance treaty. The rising tide of the Japanese people's struggle is higher and higher, continuous and unrelenting. With the support of people all over the world, the struggle of the Japanese people will inevitably become more and more developed and more and more powerful. In the face of the power of the people, the wolves and the villains who lead the wolves will not escape the fate they deserve.

    警告引狼者
    鲁巍
    日本有句谚语：“引狼入室——全屋遭殃。”然而，正是日本的岸信介在充当带路人，企图通过日美军事同盟条约的签订，将美帝国主义这只恶狼进一步引入日本！
    日本人民不会忘记，二十世纪三十年代至四十年代间，日本军国主义所发动的侵略战争，给日本人民带来的深重苦难和惨痛的后果。今天，原子弹受害者的呻吟声依然在耳，广岛死难者的血迹犹新；日本人民怎能不对岸信介政府甘心充当美国侵略远东的帮凶，重新走上战争老路，导致日本毁灭的罪恶行为，愤起抗击呢？中国人民曾经遭受过日本帝国主义者的侵略和杀害，曾经同这个凶恶的敌人斗争了十余年，终于在中国共产党的领导下，在苏联红军参加远东战争之后，最后打垮了这头疯狂的野兽。今天，我们又怎能不衷心地支持日本人民的英勇斗争呢？
    日本人民已经举起了铁拳。看吧，东京举行了全国性的大会，反对这项军事同盟条约的签订；大阪、神户、福冈等地人民纷纷集会和游行示威，反对这项军事同盟条约的签订。日本人民的斗争怒潮，一浪高过一浪，连续不断。在全世界人民的支持下，日本人民的斗争必然会愈来愈开展，愈来愈强大。在人民的力量面前，恶狼和引狼的坏蛋，都逃不了应有的下场。
