Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: Party and government organs and the people in various regions are extending cordial Spring Festival greetings to families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. The慰問 (comfort and greeting) activities are still underway in various places.

This year's Spring Festival comfort activities are very extensive and in-depth. Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have organized Spring Festival comfort delegations, and many people's communes, industrial and mining enterprises have also organized comfort teams and groups to express greetings to families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, and to inspect preferential treatment and demobilization and resettlement work. Leaders in many provinces and cities visited hospital wards to chat with the sick and wounded, and visited the homes of families of martyrs and military personnel as guests. Many workers, farmers, and urban residents kindly helped families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled revolutionary soldiers with household chores and arranged festival activities. Many regions organized youth to carry out activities such as "doing something for families of martyrs and military personnel." Some cinemas and theaters held special receptions, performing wonderful programs and films for families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled revolutionary soldiers.

The soaring development of the motherland's socialist construction, and the deep concern of the Party and the people, have made this Spring Festival even more joyful and inspiring for families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. In Jinggangshan, the cradle of the revolution, snow fell on the first day of the new year. Local Party and government leaders braved the snow to visit Ciping, Da Wujing, and other places, to offer New Year greetings to families of martyrs and military personnel, and veteran Red Army soldiers. They brought pork, cigarettes, tea and other gifts to the Ciping Home of Revolutionary Honor. They also talked with veteran Red Army soldiers and families of martyrs and military personnel about the beautiful prospect of building Jinggangshan into a new socialist mountain city. During the Spring Festival, party and government leaders of Ruijin County came to Chairman Mao's former residence in Shazhouba and Yeping to celebrate the festival with local families of martyrs and military personnel, and veteran revolutionary comrades. Last year, Ruijin County issued 1,500 quilts and more than 2,500 pieces of clothing to families of martyrs and military personnel. All the people's communes in the county also established 19 "Homes of Revolutionary Honor," providing a happy old age for more than 500 elderly revolutionary comrades without children. In the Yan'an area of northern Shaanxi, more than 2,700 families of martyrs and military personnel were visited during the Spring Festival. On the first day of the new year, leaders of the Nanchang Municipal Party Committee and government visited Miao Min, the wife of revolutionary martyr Fang Zhimin. This Spring Festival was even more joyful for her family. Her second son, Fang Ming, got married on New Year's Eve. All three sons and daughters-in-law, as well as two grandchildren, came to her side to celebrate the Spring Festival with her. In the home of Lin Xiangqian, a martyr of the "February 7th" strike in Xiangqian Commune, Minhou County, Fujian Province, guests were abundant in recent days. Responsible cadres of the local Party and government, as well as commune members, came to pay New Year's greetings to the martyr's wife, Chen Guizhen. Chen Guizhen, who is over sixty years old, was selected as an activist in socialist construction in the county and the special zone for her active participation in social work. Under Changbai Mountain, leading cadres of the Hunchun County Party Committee and government invited cadres of the former Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army to hold a forum and get-together before the Spring Festival. Zhao Cangbi, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Vice Governor of Sichuan Province, led the Sichuan Provincial People's Spring Festival Comfort Delegation to the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Servicemen's Sanatorium to express their cordial greetings. Famous Sichuan opera actor Chen Shufang and others gave a wonderful performance for the wounded and sick soldiers and recuperating personnel. Zhou Quandili, a special-class revolutionary disabled soldier, told the comrades of the comfort delegation that he got married in November 1958 and is now the father of one child. More than 90% of the wounded, sick, and recuperating personnel in the sanatorium are now married and living a happy family life.

Families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers have expressed their determination to make greater achievements this year to repay the care of the Party, the government, and the people. Liu Haiqing, a 62-year-old model family member of a martyr from the Heping Cotton Textile Factory in Guiyang, said that he would teach his skills to young workers without reservation and contribute his strength to the country. He is now carrying out technological innovations in the factory to semi-mechanize silk thread production. Yan Suzhen, a model military family member, an old woman, said that she would write a letter to her child on the front line of national defense, telling him about the care of the Party and the government for the families of martyrs and military personnel and the happiness of family life, and encourage him to work hard to defend the gate of the motherland. Xie Shaowang, the nephew of martyr Xie Zichang from Lijiacha Commune, Zichang County, Shaanxi Province, said that in addition to doing a good job in the production team this year, he also plans to work twenty-nine labor days each month, lead all the families of martyrs and military personnel in the team to set up a collective pig farm and a sheep farm, and accumulate 500 dan of fertilizer per person before spring plowing, so as to strive for a greater agricultural harvest.
