Xinhua News Agency report: In the days of rapid development of China's steel industry, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are high-spirited and elated, vying to go to steel bases to contribute their efforts and ideas, and engaging in selfless labor for the further development of the country's steel industry.

According to incomplete statistics, last year, troops stationed throughout the country supported 102 new and expanded projects at Anshan Iron and Steel, Baotou Steel, Shanghai Steel, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, and other locations. A certain unit stationed on the Fujian front, despite its heavy coastal defense duties, dispatched thousands of officers and soldiers to participate in the basic construction project of the Sanming Iron and Steel Plant. The soldiers were extremely excited at the thought of using the steel they personally helped produce to support national construction, and they expressed one after another: even if we have to cover the sky and pave the earth, endure wind and eat dew, we will build "San Steel" well. They cut down bamboo from the mountains and carried straw from a hundred miles away, building work sheds in the deep mountains and valleys, working day and night in two shifts. During construction, as soon as the day shift comrades finished work, the night shift comrades arrived. In heavy rainstorms, the soldiers dug with their hoes amidst splashes of water, stepped through mud, and long lines of vehicles ran through the water. In this way, they worked with the workers to clear away thorns, flatten mountain tops, and build blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, and a large number of factory buildings. In the Kunming area, troops, in supporting the expansion project of the Kunming Iron and Steel Company, ensured that there were people when needed and materials when needed. When the construction of the large rolling mill workshop of Kunming Iron and Steel Company entered the most critical stage, they sent a large labor force of several thousand people, completing more than 200,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work in a short period of time. When Kunming Iron and Steel urgently needed machinery and transportation, they sent a large number of bulldozers, rippers, excavators, and vehicles. The activities of the Jinan area troops supporting the Jinan Iron and Steel Plant last year were uninterrupted; as soon as one unit finished, another unit was sent, with the slogan "Work harder than Wu Song, determination surpasses the Foolish Old Man."

In Guangdong, People's Navy soldiers, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, and together with fraternal troops, built an "August 1st" Iron and Steel Plant. Captain Zhang Chonglun, who had just gotten married, also brought his bride to the construction site and launched a competition in labor. Troops stationed in Chongqing demonstrated a high degree of selflessness in supporting the major repair project of the No. 3 and No. 4 open hearth furnaces of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. The No. 3 and No. 4 open hearth furnaces began major repairs immediately after discharging molten steel. The officers and soldiers took turns working in temperatures of 100 degrees Celsius, changing shifts every three minutes, and finally completed the major repair task ahead of schedule. In order to commend their achievements, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company awarded the title of "Steel Seizing Experts" to 104 officers and soldiers in this unit.

In order to pave the way for steel transportation lines, various units actively helped steel plants near their garrisons build railways and highways last year. Last year, troops in the Shenyang area sent a large number of officers, soldiers, and technicians to build the double track of the Liaoyang-Benxi railway, making the transportation routes of Anshan Iron and Steel smoother. The Yushuling Tunnel they excavated was completed ahead of schedule due to vigorous technical innovation. While completing the road construction tasks assigned by the state, the Railway Corps also allocated manpower and material resources to assist steel bases in the southern provinces in building short-distance dedicated railway lines. Among the more than 10,000 kilometers of highways built by the entire army to help local areas last year, many were built to help steel plants. Since the beginning of winter, a certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region has braved severe cold and heavy snow to help the Xinyuan County Iron and Steel Plant in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture build a highway from the factory to the mine.

Over the past year, troops in the Shenyang, Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and other regions have dispatched a large number of vehicles to support the transportation work of Anshan Iron and Steel, Baotou Steel, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, etc. The motorcade supporting Anshan Iron and Steel has safely traveled more than 3.24 million kilometers in nine months, transporting more than 1.07 million tons of raw materials and construction materials, and has recently been rewarded by Anshan Iron and Steel Company. A certain vehicle battalion on the Baotou Steel construction site has been loading and unloading quickly, running steadily with full loads, and overfulfilling its transportation tasks every month since March of last year. In addition to being rewarded by Baotou Iron and Steel Company, the leading organs rated them as a "Five-Good Battalion." The three services of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai sent a transportation brigade composed of 600 officers and soldiers and 100 vehicles to transport materials on construction sites such as Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and No. 5, regardless of wind or rain, since New Year's Day. They said: we are not afraid of the cold weather, we are not afraid of the dark roads, as long as the "Steel Commander" needs it, we will definitely strive to support. Last year, the People's Air Force also dispatched more than 500 sorties of aircraft to help steel industry departments in Beijing, Shenyang, Baotou, Chongqing, Urumqi, and other places transport technicians, blueprints, and production equipment, solving many urgent difficulties for them.

    用钢铁意志支援钢铁建设
    解放军在祖国建设战线立下大功
    新华社讯　在我国钢铁工业飞跃发展的日子里，中国人民解放军广大官兵意气风发，欢欣鼓舞，争相奔赴钢铁基地献力献策，为祖国钢铁事业的进一步发展，进行忘我的劳动。
    据不完全统计，去年驻全国各地部队支援鞍钢、包钢、上钢、重庆钢铁公司等新建和扩建工程有一百零二项。福建前线某部队从繁重的海防守备任务中，抽出几千名官兵参加了三明钢铁厂的基本建设工程。战士们联想到将来用自己亲手炼出来的钢支援国家建设，心情十分激动，纷纷表示：就是上盖天，下铺地，风餐露宿，也要把“三钢”建设好。他们从高山上削下毛竹，从百里外挑来稻草，在深山峡谷里盖起工棚，分上下两班日夜施工。施工中，日班的同志没收工，夜班的就来了。大雷雨的天气里，战士们是一镐一阵水花，一步一洼泥泞，长龙般的车子队也在水里奔跑。这样，他们和工人们一起铲掉了荆棘，削平了山头，盖起一座座高炉、平炉和大批厂房。昆明地区部队在支援昆明钢铁公司扩建工程中，做到了要人有人，要物资有物资。当昆明钢铁公司大型轧钢车间建设工程进入最紧张阶段时，他们派去了有数千人参加的劳动大军，短时间内完成了二十多万立方米的土石方工程任务。当昆钢迫切需要机械和运输力量的时候，他们又送去了大批推土机、松土机、挖土机和汽车。济南地区部队去年支援济南钢铁厂的活动没有间断，这支部队刚干完，另一支部队又开去了，他们的口号是“干劲赛武松，决心超愚公”。
    在广东的人民海军战士，在地方党委统一领导下，和兄弟部队一起，兴建了一座“八一”钢铁厂。刚结婚的张崇伦上尉，也带着新娘赶到工地，并且在劳动中展开了竞赛。驻重庆部队在支援重庆钢铁公司三、四号平炉大修工程时，表现了高度的忘我精神。三、四号平炉刚出完钢水就开始大修，官兵们在摄氏一百度的高温下轮番作业，三分钟一换班，终于提前完成了大修任务。重庆钢铁公司为了表彰他们的功迹，授予这支队伍中的一百零四名官兵“夺钢能手”的称号。
    为了给钢铁运输线开道，去年各部队积极帮助驻地附近的钢铁厂修建铁路、公路。沈阳地区部队去年派出大批官兵和技术人员，修建辽阳至本溪的铁路复线，使鞍钢的运输道路更加畅通。他们开挖的榆树岭隧道，由于大闹技术革新提前完工了。铁道兵在完成国家给予的筑路任务的同时，还抽出人力、物力，协助南方各省的钢铁基地修建短途铁路专用线。去年全军帮助地方修建的一万多公里公路中，有不少是帮助钢铁厂修建的。新疆军区某部，入冬以来冒着严寒大雪，帮助伊犁哈萨克族自治州新源县钢铁厂修筑了一条从厂房到矿山的公路。
    沈阳、北京、南京、广州等地区部队，一年来派出大批汽车支援鞍钢、包钢和太原钢铁公司等的运输工作，支援鞍钢的汽车队，九个月来安全行驶了三百二十四万多公里，运送原料、建筑器材等一百零七万多吨，最近受到了鞍山钢铁公司的奖励。在包钢工地上的某部汽车营从去年3月以来，一直快装快卸，满装稳跑，月月都超额完成运输任务，除受到包头钢铁公司的奖励外，领导机关评他们为“五好营”。驻上海陆、海、空三军派出由六百名官兵、一百辆汽车组成的运输大队，从元旦开始，风雨无阻地在上钢一厂、五厂等工地上运输物资，他们表示：不怕天寒地冻，不怕夜黑路险，只要“钢帅”需要，我们一定奋力支援。去年，人民空军还派出了五百多架次飞机，帮助北京、沈阳、包头、重庆、乌鲁木齐等地的钢铁工业部门运送技术人员，图纸和生产设备，为他们解决了许多急需的困难。（附图片）
