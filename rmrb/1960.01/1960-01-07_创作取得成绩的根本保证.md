The Fundamental Guarantee for Achieving Success in Creative Work
    Feng Deying

I like to read literary works that are full of clear love and hate, and brimming with political enthusiasm. Because in them are noble and great heroic figures shaped by the author with full enthusiasm, serving as models for us to learn from and emulate; there are also images of reactionaries—enemies of the people—revealed and portrayed by the author with incomparable anger, making us hate the enemy even more, despise the enemy, and thereby strengthen our revolutionary power to eliminate the enemy! However, sometimes I also see works like this: after reading them, you feel a bit "dry" and a bit "flat," and you don't know what they have given you. In them, there are also positive characters that the author strives to praise, and negative characters that are whipped, but the characters praised by the author are not deeply loved, loved reluctantly, or even not loved at all but rather disliked; and the negative characters criticized by the author cannot be hated or hated thoroughly. There are certainly many reasons for this situation, but I think the most important one is the author's class sentiment, that is, the writer lacks the thoughts and feelings of the working people.

Speaking of my personal situation, it is also the same. I started learning literary creation driven by strong class sentiments. Because I was born into a poor family, I suffered the cruel oppression and exploitation of the feudal landlord class. Later, I was liberated in the revolutionary struggle led by the Party, and grew up in the newly born liberated areas. From my own experience, I deeply realized that the happy life in the new society did not come easily, but was obtained through the bloodshed, sacrifice, and hard struggle of millions of heroes led by the Party. Therefore, I have ardent and deep love for the Party, for the people's army, and for the revolutionary people; and I have deep hatred for the enemy, and an irreconcilable sentiment. In my works depicting the revolutionary war, I try to run through these two basic feelings: love for the people and hatred for the enemy. When I do this, it can be said to be instinctive, natural. Precisely because of this, I have recorded some of the glorious deeds of the revolutionary people to some extent, giving people some useful things. However, I gradually felt that as a proletarian writer, as a Communist Party writer, it is far from enough to have only this instinctive national and class love and hate. If it can still play a positive role in reflecting the anti-Japanese national struggle, then in the period of socialist revolution and construction, there must be further improvement.

I myself have had such lessons. Some of the shortcomings and errors in my works are due to insufficient artistic cultivation and insufficient immersion in life, but some are also caused by problems in my own worldview. For example, the portrayal of some characters is not standing high enough, and the class essence of the characters cannot be dug out from the complicated class struggle, so that the characters are more typical. Like Village Chief Jiang He in "Ying Chun Hua," there are originally such people in real life: of middle-peasant origin, joined the Party during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and were very active in the struggle against the national enemy; but after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, when the revolution entered a new stage, his thoughts could not keep up, and he only cared about the comfortable life in front of him, and did not want to continue to move forward, playing the role of a wealthy peasant spokesman in the Party. Although I saw this phenomenon, I could not analyze him because of my low level of political thought and failure to establish a proletarian worldview of continuous revolution. As a result, the development and deepening of this struggle was avoided in the work, making him a dispensable character, which weakened the ideological nature of the theme. Furthermore, I often cannot analyze and insight into life with a highly keen political vision, and sometimes I am confused by complex social phenomena. I simply pursue so-called life details that can express the character's characteristics, making artistic description deviate from the fundamental task of serving politics and the theme ideology, revealing the color of naturalism.

In short, through my own experience, I deeply feel that it is very important for a proletarian literary and art worker to study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong's thought, and establish a proletarian worldview, especially during the period of socialist revolution and construction. It is the fundamental guarantee for us to achieve success in creative work.

    创作取得成绩的根本保证
    冯德英
    我喜欢读爱憎分明、政治热情饱满的文艺作品。因为这里面有作者怀着满腔热情塑造起来的高尚伟大的英雄人物，做为我们学习、仿效的榜样；也有作者以无比的愤怒揭露刻画出的反动派——人民的敌人的形象，使我们更加痛恨敌人，仇视敌人，以至增强革命的力量，去消灭敌人！但是，有时也看到这样的作品：读过后觉得有点“干”，有些“平”，不知道给了自己一些什么。这里面也有作者着力歌颂的正面人物，也有鞭打的反面人物，可是作者所歌颂的人物使人爱的不深，爱的勉强，甚至根本不爱而且反感；而对作者所批判的反面人物则恨不起来或恨的不透。造成这种情况的原因固然多，不过我以为最主要的一条是作者的阶级感情问题，是作家缺乏劳动人民的思想感情。
    联系到我个人情形，也是如此。我开始学习文艺创作就是被强烈的阶级感情所推动的。因为，我出生在贫苦的家庭里，饱受过封建地主阶级的残酷压迫和剥削，后来，在党领导的革命斗争中得到解放，在新生的解放区里成长起来。从我的切身经历中，深深地体会到新社会的幸福生活来得不易，是党领导的千百万英雄流血牺牲、艰苦奋斗得来的，因而对党，对人民军队，对革命的人民，有着热烈的深挚的爱情；而对敌人，有着深仇大恨，有着誓不两立的情绪。在我描写革命战争的作品里，我力图贯串这两种基本的感情：对人民的爱，对敌人的恨。我在这样做的时候，可以说是本能的，自然而然的。正为此吧，我才多少地记录了一些革命人民的光辉事迹，给人一些有益的东西。但是，我逐渐感觉到作为一个无产阶级的作家，作为一个共产党员的作家，仅仅有这种本能的民族的和阶级的爱憎，还是很不够的，如果说它在反映抗日民族斗争，还能起积极的作用，那么，在社会主义革命和建设时期，就必须有进一步的提高。
    我自己就有这样的教训，在我的作品中，有些缺点和错误是由于艺术修养和深入生活不够所致，但是也有的是自己世界观上的毛病造成的。比如，对有的人物的刻画，站的不高，不能从复杂的阶级斗争中，挖掘出人物的阶级本质，使人物更有典型性。像“迎春花”里的村长江合，现实生活中本来是有这种人：中农出身，在抗日战争中入党，对民族敌人的斗争很积极；但是抗战胜利了，革命进入新的阶段，他的思想却跟不上，只顾眼前的安乐日子，不想继续前进，在党内起了作富裕农民代言人的作用。我虽看到了这一现象，却由于自己政治思想水平不高，没有很好地树立起无产阶级不断革命的世界观，所以就不能剖析他，结果在作品中回避了这场斗争的展开和深入，使他成为可有可无的人物，也就削弱了主题的思想性。再者，我往往不能以高度敏锐的政治眼光去分析洞察生活，有时就被复杂的社会现象所迷惑，单纯去追求所谓能表现人物性格特征的生活细节，使艺术描写脱离了为政治、为主题思想服务的根本任务，流露了自然主义的色彩。
    总之，通过我自己的经历，深切地感到做为一个无产阶级的文艺工作者，学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛主席的思想、树立无产阶级的世界观是非常重要的，尤其是社会主义革命和建设时期，它是我们在创作中取得成绩的根本保证。
