Yang Maoying is Happy and Free
Sun Ni

The pigs in the feeding farm of the Changqi Production Team of the Suiyang Commune in Meitan, Guizhou, are loved by everyone who sees them. Visitors always surround the pig pens, looking and looking, reluctant to leave.

"Tsk, tsk! Look at that waist, that rump, how fat!"
"Hey! It's practically worth a calf!"

The pigs in this feeding farm all have big heads and ears, and shiny coats. Last year, one fat pig weighed a staggering 1,040 jin, was seven chi and five cun long, three chi and five cun tall, and had a waist circumference of one chi and three cun. It walked slowly and swayed, its four feet barely able to carry its entire weight.

Who raises these pigs, and what experience do they have? These pigs are raised by comrade Yang Maoying. She has been raising pigs for four full years, from 1956 to now.

Raising pigs requires feed. Once, Yang Maoying went to visit the county farm, where the feed hall displayed more than 300 kinds of wild pig feed. Yang Maoying's eyes lit up when she saw it: so many things can be used to feed pigs! She couldn't read, so she relied on observation and memory to remember more than 70 kinds of common wild plants in her mind. When she returned, she discussed it with the production team leader and mobilized the primary school students to go up the mountain to find them in their spare time. Every morning, Yang Maoying, carrying a basket and a sickle, went up the mountain with the primary school students, searching everywhere on the slopes. Then, basket after basket of wild feed was carried back home. Yang Maoying chopped these feeds finely late at night, washed them clean with water, mixed them with bran and a small amount of salt, and cooked them until they were soft and mushy. When she carried the bucket and put the pig food into the trough one ladle at a time, the pigs scrambled to eat it greedily. At this time, Yang Maoying smiled: these weeds are so useful, this can save a lot of money for the commune! The happier she felt, the greater her enthusiasm became.

Yang Maoying has to clean the pigsty five times a day, and also sprinkle lime, making it clean and tidy. At the same time, she also bathes the large fat pigs weighing more than 200 jin every day. She uses warm water when it is cold and cold water when it is hot, all year round, every day. No wonder the visitors all praise her for raising clean pigs and that the pigsties have no odor.

In the past four years, the number of pigs raised by Yang Maoying has increased, and the number of pigs sold has also increased. From 1956 to 1958, more than 400 pigs were sold, and in 1959, another 177 fat pigs were sold, including six pigs weighing from 800 to 1,000 jin, nine pigs weighing from 500 to 800 jin, 102 pigs weighing from 300 to 500 jin, and 60 pigs weighing less than 300 jin.

Every time a fat pig is sold, Yang Maoying feels like she is sending a daughter off to be married. The night before, she feeds the pig until it is full and gives it a bath, making it clean and tidy. Early the next morning, she gets up to greet the fat pig to "get on the sedan chair." When she sees seven or eight people struggling to carry one pig, she is truly happy and proud.

Because Yang Maoying has done an excellent job in raising pigs, she has been rated as a model pig farmer for many years. In 1958, she joined the Communist Party of China and also went to Beijing to attend the National Women's Conference of Socialist Construction Activists. (Attached picture)

    杨茂英心里高兴又自在
    孙尼
    贵州湄潭绥阳公社长碛生产队饲养场的猪，谁见了都爱。来参观的人，总是围在猪圈旁边，看了又看，舍不得离开。
    “啧，啧！你看那腰身，那屁股，有多肥！”
    “嘿！这简直抵得上一条牛犊嘛！”
    这个饲养场的猪，都是肥头大耳，毛光水滑。去年有一头肥猪竟有一千零四十斤，身长七尺五寸，身高三尺五寸，腰围一尺三寸，走起来慢摇慢摆，四只脚已经载不起它全身的重量了。
    这些猪是谁饲养的，有些什么经验？这些猪是饲养员杨茂英同志喂养的。从1956年起到现在，她整整养了四年猪。
    养猪要饲料。有一回杨茂英到县农场去参观，那里的饲料馆陈设着三百多种猪的野生饲料。杨茂英一看，心里亮了：原来有这么多东西可以喂猪！她不识字，就凭着观察记忆，把七十多种常见的野生植物记在心里。回来同生产队长商量，发动小学生利用课余时间上山去找。每天一早，杨茂英带着背兜、镰刀，和小学生们一起上山，坡上坡下，到处找遍。接着，一背兜、一背兜的野生饲料背回家来了。杨茂英连夜把这些饲料砍细，用水淘洗干净，掺上糠和少量盐巴，煮得又糯又烂。当她提着桶把猪食一瓢瓢放进槽里时，猪争着抢着，大口大口地吃。这时杨茂英笑了：这些野草竟这么管用，这下可以为社里节省好多钱了！她心里越高兴，劲头也就越大。
    杨茂英每天要把猪圈打扫五次，还要撒上石灰，弄得干干净净的。同时，她每天还给两百斤以上的大肥猪洗澡，天冷用温水洗，天热用冷水洗，一年四季，天天如此。难怪来参观的人都夸奖她养的猪干净，猪圈没有臭味。
    四年来，杨茂英喂的猪越来越多，卖出的猪也越来越多。从1956年到1958年就卖出猪四百多头，1959年又卖出肥猪一百七十七头，其中八百斤到一千斤的有六头，五百斤到八百斤的九头，三百斤到五百斤的一百零二头，三百斤以下的六十头。
    每一回肥猪卖出去时，杨茂英就像送姑娘出嫁似的，头天晚上就把猪喂得饱饱的，还给它洗了澡，弄得干干净净。第二天一早，她就起来招呼肥猪“上轿”。当她看到七八个人抬一只猪还吃力时，真是又高兴又自豪。
    由于杨茂英出色地做好了养猪工作，连年被评为养猪模范。1958年参加了中国共产党，还到北京出席了全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子大会。（附图片）
