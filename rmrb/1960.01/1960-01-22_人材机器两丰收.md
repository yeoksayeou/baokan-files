    To build socialism at high speed, we need machines, but even more so, we need talent. That is to say, having the material and technical conditions of machines, we also need talent who can master, utilize, and reform these material and technical conditions. Combining the two, we can continuously transform and develop social productive forces, and continuously develop production at high speed. Therefore, we must manufacture and innovate machines, and we must cultivate and train talent. Now, the Xi'an Instrument Manufacturing Industrial School, without spending a penny of the state's money, achieves self-sufficiency and thrift in running the school, achieving a glorious harvest of both talent and machines, which is very gratifying.
    The Xi'an Instrument Manufacturing Industrial School is an ordinary secondary vocational school. In the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and in the rapid development of socialist construction, they have mustered revolutionary energy, vigorously promoted educational revolution, resolutely implemented the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, and in less than two years, have trained a group of intermediate technical talent for the country, and manufactured a large number of machines. This place, which is both a school and a factory, both cultivating talent and manufacturing products, is truly a good place to cultivate socialist construction cadres who are both red and expert in a fast, economical, and effective manner.
    It should be recognized that secondary vocational schools are technical schools with a specialized nature, and generally have more opportunities for production practice and technical operation. Therefore, their production practice courses are relatively important. How to better arrange production practice and better cultivate intermediate technical talent for the country is a particularly noteworthy issue. Because students will directly participate in production in enterprises or guide a certain aspect of production work as soon as they leave school, if they lack practical production knowledge and cannot master operating techniques, then it will be impossible to meet the country's requirements for them. Therefore, how to make teaching and productive labor more closely integrated, better implement the Party's education policy, and cultivate specialized talent who resolutely serve the cause of socialist construction, is a very urgent and arduous task for secondary vocational schools. If every secondary vocational school can, like the Xi'an Instrument Manufacturing Industrial School, organically link teaching and production, cultivating talent with both theoretical knowledge and operating techniques, and producing products needed by the country, this will have significant implications for both aspects. The achievements made by the Xi'an Instrument Manufacturing Industrial School demonstrate the correctness of their school-running direction. This school-running direction is also the school-running direction of all secondary vocational schools, and it is worthy of attention.

    人材机器两丰收
    柏生
    高速度地建设社会主义，既需要机器，更需要人材。也就是说，有了机器的物质技术条件，还要有能够掌握、运用和改革物质技术条件的人材。两者结合起来，就能不断地变革和发展社会生产力，不断地高速度地发展生产。因此，我们就要制造和革新机器，就要培养和训练人材。现在，西安仪器制造工业学校不花国家一文钱，自给自足勤俭办学，获得了人材、机器双丰收的光辉成就，十分可喜。
    西安仪器制造工业学校是一所普通的中等专业学校。在工农业大跃进，社会主义建设事业飞速发展中，它们鼓起了革命干劲，大搞教育革命，坚决贯彻执行了党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，在不到两年的时间里，就为国家培养了一批中级技术人材，并且制造了大批机器。这个既是学校，又是工厂，既培养人材，又制造产品的场所，真是多快好省地培养又红又专的社会主义建设干部的好地方。
    应该认识，中等专业学校是专业性质的技术学校，一般生产实习、技术操作的机会比较多，因此他们的生产实习课也就比较重要。如何更好地安排生产实习，更好地为国家培养中级技术人材，是一个特别值得注意的问题。因为学生一走出校门就要直接参加企业中的生产或指导某一方面的生产工作，如果他们缺乏实际生产知识，不能掌握操作技术，那就不可能符合国家对他们的要求。所以，如何使教学与生产劳动更紧密地结合，更好地贯彻党的教育方针，培养出坚决为社会主义建设事业服务的专业人材，这对中等专业学校来说，是很迫切而艰巨的任务。如果每一个中等专业学校都能像西安仪器制造工业学校一样，使教学和生产有机地联系起来，既培养了有理论知识和操作技术的人材，又生产了国家需要的产品，这对哪方面说来，都具有重大的意义。西安仪器制造工业学校作出的成绩，说明了他们办学方向的正确。这个办学的方向，也正是所有的中等专业学校办学的方向，值得重视。
