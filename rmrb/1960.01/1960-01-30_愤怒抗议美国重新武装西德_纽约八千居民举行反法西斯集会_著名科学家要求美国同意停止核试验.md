    Xinhua News Agency, January 28th. TASS, New York, January 27th: Eight thousand New York residents held a rally in Union Square on the 26th, angrily protesting against the revival of fascism and the rearmament of West Germany. Participants included Black and white people, workers, clerks, students, and intellectuals. They held signs reading: "No Weapons for Nazis," "Ban Fascist Propaganda in the U.S.," "Fascism—America's Disgrace," etc.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, January 28th. TASS, New York, January 27th: Some American physicists, in the name of the Federation of American Scientists, held a press conference calling on the United States to agree to stop nuclear weapons testing.
    
    The press conference was chaired by Dr. Inglis, a senior physical scientist at the Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago, Dr. Weisskopf, a physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dr. Wolff, head of the Physics Department at Cooper Union Technical College.

    These prominent scientists refuted the argument that a complete cessation of nuclear testing is impractical because it is impossible to detect small nuclear explosions. They said that some might take advantage of this to take risks, but the consolidation of international security through the conclusion of a verifiable agreement to cease all nuclear weapons testing would largely offset this risk.

    Just as these prominent scientists, whose views clearly reflect the opinions of the vast majority of American scientific workers, advocated a complete ban on nuclear testing, Dr. Teller, the so-called "father of the American hydrogen bomb," who has close ties with the U.S. military, expressed the opposite view. He believes that nuclear tests can continue "underground and in outer space."

    愤怒抗议美国重新武装西德
    纽约八千居民举行反法西斯集会
    著名科学家要求美国同意停止核试验
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社纽约27日讯：纽约八千居民26日在联合广场举行集会，愤怒抗议法西斯主义的复活和重新武装西德。参加集会的有黑人和白人，工人、职员、学生和知识分子。他们举着的标语牌写着：“不要给纳粹武器”、“禁止在美国的法西斯宣传”、“法西斯主义——美国的耻辱”等等。
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社纽约27日消息：一些美国物理学家以美国科学家协会的名义举行记者招待会，呼吁美国同意停止核武器试验。
    主持招待会的有芝加哥阿贡国立实验所的高级物理科学家英格利斯博士、马萨诸塞理工学院物理教授魏斯柯普夫博士、库柏联合技术学院物理系主任沃尔夫博士。
    这些著名的科学家驳斥了这样一种论调：由于不可能发现小型核爆炸，要完全停止核试验是行不通的。他们说，有人会仗着这点而进行冒险，但是只要缔结有监督的停止一切核武器试验的协定，从而巩固国际安全，就能在很大程度上抵消这种冒险。
    正当这些明显反映绝大多数美国科学工作者意见的著名科学家主张完全禁止核试验时，一个同美国军方有紧密联系的所谓“美国氢弹之父”的泰勒博士却发表了相反的意见。他认为，核试验“可以在地下和在宇宙空间”继续进行。
