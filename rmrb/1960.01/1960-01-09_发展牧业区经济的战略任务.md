The pastoral areas of Qinghai Province are vast and rich in resources. With the rapid advancement of socialist construction, the construction of pastoral areas is developing rapidly and will gradually become the focus of construction in Qinghai Province. To meet the needs of the development of various construction undertakings and rapidly develop the economy of pastoral areas, fundamentally changing the face of pastoral areas, the current strategic task is to reclaim wasteland in large quantities, develop agricultural production at high speed, strive to increase grain production, and achieve grain self-sufficiency.

**Marching Towards Wasteland, Seeking Grain from the Land**

Before liberation, the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province were basically a single livestock economy. Except for a small amount of crops planted in Gonghe, Tongren, Jianzha, Dulan, Yushu and other counties, most places did not engage in agriculture at all, and grain was entirely dependent on supplies from agricultural areas. Coupled with the brutal oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang bandits and traffic blockages, the vast majority of herdsmen lived a life of semi-starvation, eating only a few dozen kilograms of grain a year. People in some remote areas such as Yushu and Guoluo even "did not eat grains" all year round, living a primitive life of "drinking blood." After liberation, although the living standards of herdsmen have greatly improved, the development of agricultural production still cannot keep up with the needs of further development of production in pastoral areas. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the glorious light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and on the basis of the great victory of the socialist revolution in pastoral areas and the realization of people's communes, the vast number of cadres and people of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas have broken superstitions, liberated their minds, and with high spirits and soaring energy, agriculture production has obtained unprecedented glorious achievements while animal husbandry has developed rapidly. By 1959, 68 state-owned farms (including the Henan Youth Reclamation Team Farm) had been established in pastoral areas. The vast majority of counties and people's communes had implemented a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, reclaimed a large amount of wasteland, and planted grain, feed, and vegetable crops. The planting area in pastoral areas has developed from 300,000 mu in 1949 to 1.55 million mu in 1959, and total grain output has increased from 29.15 million jin to 436.5 million jin. Of the thirty-five counties and cities in the pastoral area (excluding Menyuan, Guide, and Xunhua), in addition to Gonghe, Tongren, and Jianzha counties, which achieved self-sufficiency in grain, feed, and vegetables before 1958, Guinan, Haiyan, Dulan, Delingha, Wulan, Yushu, and Chengduo counties achieved "three self-sufficiencies" in 1959. Some counties and communes have achieved semi-self-sufficiency. Guinan County's Guomaying Commune sold 820,000 jin of surplus grain to the state in 1959; Gangcha County's Ha'ergai Commune achieved grain self-sufficiency in 1959, the first year they planted crops.

In the winter of 1959, under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Second Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, an unprecedented large-scale wasteland reclamation movement was launched throughout the province. The call to "March towards wasteland, seek grain from the land" and strive to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, vegetables, and feed in advance, was inspiring and boosted morale. The enthusiasm of the masses grew, and wasteland reclamation targets were raised again and again. A labor force of 440,000 people in the province took up arms and plunged into the battle of wasteland reclamation and water conservancy construction. In just over two months, the province newly reclaimed more than 3.83 million mu of wasteland, completing the plan to reclaim 3 million mu of wasteland in the winter of 1959 ahead of schedule, which is nearly three times the 1.39 million mu of wasteland reclaimed in the ten years since liberation. Among them, various prefectures and counties in the pastoral area reclaimed 2 million mu of wasteland, which is five times the original cultivated area of 410,000 mu before liberation.

**The Process of Agricultural Development in Pastoral Areas is a Process of Struggling with Various Erroneous Ideas**

The great development of agricultural production in pastoral areas, especially the great victory of the wasteland reclamation movement, is a great victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the result of large-scale mass movements. The entire process of agricultural development in pastoral areas is also a process of struggling with various right-leaning ideas. Right-leaning opportunists opposed the development of agriculture in pastoral areas from the very beginning, attacking our planting in pastoral areas as "subjectivism." Some people said that "crops cannot be grown at high altitudes, and crops cannot mature without ninety days of absolute frost-free period," and so on. Some comrades with conservative ideas were also skeptical and advised us to "take it slowly." In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of cadres and people of all ethnic groups have carried out irreconcilable struggles against various forms of right-leaning thought and conservative remarks, fully developing the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and "declaring war on nature, seizing fields from the Gobi." The slogans put forward were: "Turn alkali land into Qin Chuan, make the grassland surpass Jiangnan, and turn the Gobi into a land of rice and grain." These ambitious words and soaring ambitions fully demonstrated the high revolutionary enthusiasm and soaring energy of the broad masses, and were also an important guarantee for the development of agricultural production and large-scale reclamation of wasteland in pastoral areas.

The high altitude and short frost-free period in Qinghai's pastoral areas are somewhat unfavorable to the development of agricultural production. However, the long sunshine hours and large temperature difference between day and night are beneficial to crop growth. Brave and hardworking people were not intimidated by the difficulties and fought stubbornly with the difficulties in every possible way. The masses in Jiuzhi County built more than 1,000 earthen stoves to smoke and prevent frost. In the first year of wasteland reclamation, 22 mu of highland barley had an average yield of up to 530 jin per mu. Gaqu Farm in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture overcame 23 natural disasters such as frost, freezing, wind, and hail, and obtained a large-area high-yield record of thousands of jin per mu, among which more than 3 mu of highland barley had a yield of up to 2,000 jin per mu. Some farms in Qaidam adopted the advanced experience of winter wheat planting, overcoming the difficulty of too short a frost-free period. Gobi Farm fought against alkali damage in every possible way, and achieved a great victory of an average yield of 800 jin per mu of 8,000 mu of alkaline wheat. Even in areas with high altitudes and short frost-free periods or even no absolute frost-free periods, planting grain has been successful. In Maqin County, 173 mu of highland barley and 27 mu of rapeseed matured, and the highest yield of highland barley reached 320 jin per mu. All of this shows that giving full play to human subjective initiative is of vital importance. As long as the strength and wisdom of the broad masses are brought into full play, the difficulties on our road forward can be overcome. The mistake of the right-leaning opportunists lies in their metaphysical view of problems. They only see things and not people, only see difficulties and not favorable conditions. In their eyes, things are always static and unchanging, difficulties are insurmountable, and people are powerless in the face of nature and can only be slaves of nature. The facts have completely shattered all their fallacies. Not only can crops be grown in pastoral areas, but large-scale high yields can be achieved.

**Taking Animal Husbandry as the Main Focus, Combining Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, and Developing Diversified Operations**

The great development of agriculture in pastoral areas is also the result of the great victory of the socialist revolution and the realization of people's communes. In 1958, the vigorous anti-feudal struggle for grievances widely carried out in pastoral areas achieved a great victory in the socialist revolution. It realized the people's commune in one fell swoop, completely destroyed the feudal oppression and exploitation system of the herdboy owners class, fundamentally changed the relations of production, and liberated the productive forces, creating extremely favorable conditions for the great development of agriculture. Before the socialist revolution, the herdboy owners class monopolized a large amount of the best grasslands and desperately opposed wasteland reclamation and planting crops, saying that "water conservancy construction on grasslands is unlucky" and "disasters will occur if wasteland is reclaimed in pastoral areas," confusing the masses, resisting the government, and doing their best to create and exaggerate "agricultural and animal husbandry contradictions," using this to oppose wasteland reclamation and planting crops. At that time, the so-called "agricultural and animal husbandry contradictions" were class-based. Individual herdsmen were weak and unable to reclaim wasteland. Therefore, large-scale wasteland reclamation was impossible. After the socialist revolution, the feudal system of grassland ownership was completely changed, the socialist awareness and enthusiasm of the broad masses of laboring herdsmen rose unprecedentedly, all superstitions and taboos were broken, ideological shackles were lifted, the superiority of the people's commune of "large in size and collective in nature" was fully developed, and under the guidance of the policy of "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations," communes reclaimed wasteland and teams planted crops, and many areas achieved a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, and grain self-sufficiency, even with surpluses. After communization, the relations of production fundamentally changed, and the nature of "agricultural and animal husbandry contradictions" also changed. Developing agriculture became the common interest and common demand of all the people. As long as overall consideration and comprehensive arrangements are made, agriculture and animal husbandry can be made to complement each other and make progress together. The great development of agriculture will also provide good conditions for the further development of animal husbandry and industry.

The victory of large-scale reclamation of wasteland and the great development of agriculture in pastoral areas fully proves that the policy put forward by the Provincial Party Committee of taking large-scale wasteland reclamation and expanding cultivated area as the main focus of agricultural production in pastoral areas is completely correct. It proves that "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations" is the only correct economic policy for the people's communes in pastoral areas. Facts in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, have fully proved that the vast majority of pastoral areas can grow grain, and generally have higher yields, making them high-yield grain areas in Qinghai Province. In 1958, Delingha Farm created the miracle of an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu of 10,000 mu of wheat, and Saishike Farm created a high-yield record of 8,585 jin per mu of wheat. In 1959, among the 47,000 mu of high-yield fields with more than 1,000 jin per mu in the province, pastoral areas accounted for 42,000 mu. Many farms obtained high yields of 400 jin, 500 jin, or even more than 1,000 jin per mu in the first year of wasteland reclamation and planting crops. This shows that large-scale reclamation of wasteland in pastoral areas is a fast, good, and economical way to rapidly develop agricultural production in Qinghai Province. At the same time, facts have further proved that as long as the people's communes in pastoral areas conscientiously implement the policy of "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations," unify planning, and rationally arrange cultivated land and pastures, the development of agriculture will never affect the development of animal husbandry, but will vigorously promote the development of animal husbandry. For example, Zhizhi Brigade of Guomaying Commune in Guinan County, which achieved a surplus of grain self-sufficiency, had a cultivated area of more than 10,000 mu in 1958. It not only planted grain crops, but also planted feed and forage. It used wheat straw to supplement more than 1,800 head of old, weak, pregnant, and young livestock, ensuring a net increase of 28% in livestock in 1959. The hot mating of sheep and two litters a year have also been successfully tested. Chaka Commune in Wulan County regularly fixed 60% of the labor force to engage in animal husbandry production, 24.86% of the labor force to engage in agricultural production, and the rest as mobile forces. Animal husbandry is the main focus during the busy season for animal husbandry, agriculture is the main focus during the busy season for agriculture, and sideline occupations are carried out on a large scale at ordinary times. This has not only rapidly developed agriculture, enabling the planting area to reach more than 2,300 mu in 1958 and achieving a surplus of grain self-sufficiency, but also greatly promoted the development of animal husbandry. In the winter of 1958 and spring of 1959, nearly one million jin of forage and 25,000 jin of highland barley and oats were supplemented to livestock, ensuring a net increase of 21% in livestock in 1959.

**The Political and Economic Significance of Developing Agriculture in Pastoral Areas**

Vigorously developing agriculture and reclaiming wasteland on a large scale in pastoral areas has extremely profound political and economic significance. Now, large areas of agricultural areas are beginning to form in the vast pastoral areas, and some grain production bases have been established, changing the agricultural layout of Qinghai Province and fundamentally ending the history of a single animal husbandry economy in the vast pastoral areas in the past. It is also beginning to change the backward operating methods of animal husbandry relying solely on natural grazing. The establishment of large numbers of state-owned farms and pastures and the implementation of mechanical reclamation have greatly strengthened the economic component of ownership by the whole people and started the agricultural technology revolution. The bumper harvest of agriculture has further improved the confidence and determination of the broad masses of cadres and people of all ethnic groups in developing agricultural production, and has confirmed that large-scale wasteland reclamation and expanding cultivated area is the main way to develop agricultural production at high speed in Qinghai Province. Now, vigorously grasping agriculture and greatly increasing grain production has become the common thinking of Party organizations at all levels and all the people in Qinghai Province, and has become the conscious action of the broad masses. A new situation of great agricultural development has taken shape, and a new brilliant page in the history of agricultural construction has been opened.

The vast pastoral areas of Qinghai Province are vast, the land is fertile, and there are many water sources that can be used. Preliminary investigations show that there are more than 40 million mu of reclaimable wasteland. As long as large-scale reclamation and planting is carried out, it will be of great significance to the development of the economy of pastoral areas. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Only with the great development of agriculture and the great increase in grain production can animal husbandry, industry, and transportation be developed at high speed, and can cultural, educational, and health undertakings be rapidly developed. This has been increasingly proven by facts and is increasingly understood by most comrades. To fundamentally change the economic face of pastoral areas, to make minority nationalities join the ranks of advanced nationalities, and to change the de facto state of inequality, it is necessary to vigorously develop modern industry in pastoral areas and cultivate a proletariat force of its own nationalities. The mineral resources in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province are very rich, with many types of minerals, large reserves, and wide distribution. More than 70 types have been discovered. It can be said that there are minerals in every county and everywhere. The prospects for industrial development are extremely great, and it is entirely possible to become one of the motherland's oil, chemical, non-ferrous metal, and ferrous metal bases. However, due to the small population of Qinghai Province, to develop industry on a large scale, it is necessary to move in a large number of people, and the large increase in population requires a sufficient supply of grain. Therefore, large-scale wasteland reclamation and local production of grain and vegetables have become the primary conditions for the development of industry, otherwise it will inevitably affect the rapid development of industry. For example, in the Qaidam area, due to the rapid development of industries such as petroleum in recent years, the population has soared and the need for grain and vegetables has increased. Although agriculture has developed rapidly in recent years, it still cannot meet the needs, and a large amount of grain is still imported from other places every year. Similarly, to develop animal husbandry at high speed, it must also be combined with agriculture to produce grain locally and establish a solid feed and forage base, and gradually change the operating methods that rely entirely on natural grazing. Countless facts have repeatedly proven that if livestock can be supplemented with feed during the winter and spring seasons of grass shortage, it can not only greatly enhance their physique, resist wind, snow, cold, and freezing, and reduce mortality, but also greatly improve the survival rate of reproduction and achieve two litters a year and two lambs in one birth. At the same time, pastoral areas can only achieve settlement and rotational grazing and integration of agriculture and animal husbandry to improve the lives of the people of all ethnic groups more quickly, rapidly develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and change the cultural backwardness of pastoral areas.

Therefore, resolutely implementing the policy of "expanding cultivated area and increasing yield per unit area at the same time," comprehensively arranging the labor force, continuing to reclaim wasteland in large quantities in pastoral areas, increasing grain production, actively supporting the development of animal husbandry, and preparing conditions for large-scale industrial construction, is an important political and economic task of Qinghai Province in the next few years, and also a arduous and glorious mission of Party committees at all levels in pastoral areas. It is necessary to further strengthen the leadership of agricultural production and wasteland reclamation, educate cadres to recognize the major political and economic significance of large-scale wasteland reclamation and high-speed development of agricultural production, establish the idea of long-term construction of pastoral areas, and have strong determination and perseverance, not only to reclaim wasteland and plant crops, and establish farms and pastures in pastoral areas, but also to prepare to build railways, build factories, and establish cities in pastoral areas in uninhabited areas. The workers and staff in the Qaidam area have set a good example for us, and the workers and staff and farmers and herdsmen in other areas should also catch up quickly and work hard to learn. At present, it is necessary to firmly grasp agricultural production and wasteland reclamation, and on the basis of having overfulfilled the plan to reclaim 3 million mu of wasteland in 1959, take advantage of the victory to advance bravely, strive to reclaim more wasteland in 1960, and build pastoral areas into the main grain production base of Qinghai Province as soon as possible.

**The Current Five Work Tasks**

Currently, we must focus on doing the following tasks well. First, we must further launch a high tide of spring plowing centered on water conservancy construction and accumulating and making fertilizer, try to expand the irrigated area of farmland as much as possible, strive to increase the amount of fertilizer applied, and fully prepare for spring plowing work such as seed transfer, tool preparation, machinery maintenance, and breeding livestock feeding to ensure that all existing cultivated land and newly reclaimed wasteland are sown in a timely manner this spring without missing the agricultural season.

Second, we must vigorously strengthen the survey and planning of wasteland and water sources and the design of farms, conduct overall planning, and rationally arrange cultivated land and pastures to ensure the need for further expansion of cultivated area in 1960 and beyond. Effectively integrate agriculture and animal husbandry with each other, supporting each other, while ensuring the development of animal husbandry, reclaiming wasteland and developing agriculture on a large scale.

Third, further strengthen the leadership of state-owned farms and mechanical reclamation teams. State-owned farms are the main force of agricultural production in pastoral areas. Mechanical reclamation teams are a new force, and will gradually become the main force of wasteland reclamation in pastoral areas with the development of national industry. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen leadership, continuously improve management levels, and increase the utilization rate of existing machinery to play a greater role.

Fourth, strengthen cost accounting, promote the excellent style of running farms diligently and frugally, and advocate spending less money to reclaim more wasteland, and strive to use the same investment to reclaim more wasteland.

Fifth, further mobilize the masses, carry out a large-scale wasteland reclamation movement, reclaim wasteland in every commune, and plant crops in every team. Areas that can grow grain should strive to achieve grain self-sufficiency. All agencies, troops, schools, factories, and mines in pastoral areas should also reclaim wasteland locally as much as possible, plant vegetables and grain, and raise livestock and poultry. Those with the conditions should strive to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables, meat, and grain. All people's communes and state-owned farms and pastures in pastoral areas should establish professional wasteland reclamation teams, combining year-round wasteland reclamation with short-term concentrated reclamation, and combining mechanical reclamation with human and animal-powered reclamation. In 1960 and in the next few years, two large-scale wasteland reclamation upsurges should be organized after spring plowing, before the busy season of field management, and after autumn harvest and before spring plowing, so that agricultural production in pastoral areas can develop by leaps and bounds at a faster pace, striving to change the face of pastoral areas more quickly and build pastoral areas more beautiful and prosperous.

    发展牧业区经济的战略任务
    中共青海省委第一书记　高峰
    青海省牧业区地区辽阔，资源丰富，随着社会主义建设事业的飞跃前进，牧业区的建设事业，正在一日千里地迅速发展，而且将逐步变成青海省的建设重点。为了适应各项建设事业发展的需要，迅速发展牧业区经济，根本改变牧业区面貌，当前具有战略意义的任务，就是大量开垦荒地，高速度地发展农业生产，努力增产粮食，实现粮食自给。
    向荒地进军　向大地要粮
    解放以前，青海省牧业区基本上是单一的畜牧业经济，除了共和、同仁、尖扎、都兰、玉树等县，种植少量农作物外，绝大多数地方，根本不经营农业，粮食全部依赖农业区供应。加以蒋、马匪帮的残酷压榨，交通阻塞，广大牧民群众常年过着半饥半饱的生活，一年只能吃到几十斤粮食，玉树、果洛等某些边远地区的群众，甚至常年“不食五谷”，过着“茹毛饮血”的原始生活。解放以后，牧民生活水平虽然有了极大的提高，但是农业生产的发展，仍然赶不上牧业区进一步发展生产的需要。近几年来，特别是1958年大跃进以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在牧业区社会主义革命取得伟大胜利和一举实现人民公社化的基础上，牧业区广大干部和各族农牧民群众，破除迷信，解放思想，意气风发，干劲冲天，在畜牧业迅速发展的同时，农业生产也获得了史无前例的光辉成就。到1959年，牧业区已经建立了六十八个国营农场（包括河南青年垦荒队农场），绝大多数县和人民公社，都实行了农牧结合，开垦了大量荒地，种植了粮食、饲料、蔬菜作物。牧业区的播种面积由1949年的三十万亩，发展到1959年的一百五十五万亩，粮食总产量由二千九百一十五万斤，增加至四亿三千六百五十万斤。牧业区三十五个县、市（不包括门源、贵德、循化），除共和、同仁、尖扎三个县在1958年以前实现了粮食、饲料、蔬菜自给外，1959年又有贵南、海晏、都兰、德令哈、乌兰、玉树、称多等七个县，实现了“三自给”；还有一部分县和公社，实现了半自给。贵南县过马营公社，1959年还卖给国家余粮八十二万斤；岗察县哈尔盖公社，1959年第一次种地，就实现了粮食自给。
    特别是1959年冬季，在党的八届八中全会和省委二届十二次全体会议的精神鼓舞下，在全省范围内，掀起了空前规模的大量垦荒运动。“向荒地进军，向大地要粮”，力争提前实现粮食、蔬菜、饲料自给的号召，激奋人心，鼓舞斗志，群众干劲越鼓越足，垦荒指标一跃再跃，全省四十四万劳动大军，挥戈跃马，投入垦荒和兴修水利战斗。仅仅两个多月，全省即新开荒地三百八十三万余亩，提前完成了1959年冬季开荒三百万亩的计划，等于解放十年来开荒一百三十九万亩的近三倍。其中牧业区各个州、县即开荒二百万亩，等于解放前原有耕地面积四十一万亩的五倍。
     牧业区发展农业的过程
     就是同各种错误思想斗争的过程
    牧业区农业生产的大发展，特别是垦荒运动的伟大胜利，是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，是大搞群众运动的结果。整个牧业区农业发展的过程，也就是和各种右倾思想斗争的过程。右倾机会主义分子一开始就反对在牧业区发展农业，攻击我们在牧业区种地是“主观主义”。有些人说什么“海拔高不能种庄稼，绝对无霜期没有九十天，庄稼不能成熟”等等。一些有保守思想的同志，也抱着怀疑态度，劝我们“慢慢来”。几年来，特别是大跃进以来，广大干部和各族人民，同各种形形色色的右倾思想、保守言论，进行了不调和的斗争，充分发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，“向自然宣战，向戈壁夺田”。提出的口号是：“碱地变秦川，草原赛江南，戈壁变成米粮川”。这些豪言壮语和凌云壮志，充分表现了广大群众高涨的革命热情和冲天的干劲，也是牧业区发展农业生产、大量开垦荒地的重要保证。
    青海牧业区海拔高、无霜期短，对发展农业生产有些不利。但是日照长，昼夜温差大，对作物生长是有利的。勇敢勤劳的人们，没有被困难吓倒，千方百计地同困难进行了顽强的斗争。久治县的群众，修筑一千多个土炉，熏烟防霜，第一年开荒，就有二十二亩青稞平均亩产高达五百三十斤；海北藏族自治州尕曲农场，曾战胜了二十三次大小霜、冻、风、雹等自然灾害，获得了大面积千斤丰产纪录，其中三亩多青稞亩产高达二千多斤。柴达木的一些农场，采用了小麦冬播的先进经验，克服了无霜期过短的困难。戈壁农场千方百计同碱害作斗争，获得了八千亩碱地小麦平均亩产八百斤的巨大胜利。就是在海拔高、无霜期很短甚至没有绝对无霜期的地区，种植粮食也成功了。玛沁县就有一百七十三亩青稞、二十七亩油菜成熟了，青稞最高亩产达三百二十斤。这一切都说明充分发挥人的主观能动性具有十分重要的意义。只要充分发挥广大群众的力量和智慧，就可以克服我们前进道路上的困难。右倾机会主义者的错误，就在于他们以形而上学的观点看问题，只见物，不见人，只看见困难，看不到有利条件；在他们的面前，事物永远是静止的、不变的，困难是不可克服的；人们在自然面前，是无能为力的，只能作自然的奴隶。事实彻底粉碎了他们的一切谬论。牧业区不仅能够种植庄稼，而且完全能够获得大面积丰产。
    以牧为主　农牧结合　发展多种经营
    牧业区农业的大发展，也是社会主义革命取得伟大胜利和实现人民公社化的结果。1958年，在牧业区广泛开展的轰轰烈烈的反封建诉苦斗争，取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利，一举实现了人民公社化，彻底摧毁了牧主阶级的封建压迫和剥削制度，根本改变了生产关系，解放了生产力，为农业的大发展，创造了极为有利的条件。社会主义革命以前，牧主阶级霸占着大量最好的草原，死命地反对开荒种地，说什么“草原修水利不吉利”，“牧业区开荒要遭灾难”等，迷惑群众，抗拒政府，并且尽力制造和夸大“农牧矛盾”，借此反对开荒种地。当时，所谓“农牧矛盾”，是带有阶级性的。个体牧民则由于力量单薄，无力垦荒。因此，大量垦荒就是不可能的。经过社会主义革命，封建的草原占有制度彻底改变了，广大劳动牧民的社会主义觉悟和积极性空前高涨，破除了一切迷信禁忌，解除了思想束缚，充分发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，在“以牧为主、农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针指导下，社社开荒，队队种地，不少地区实现了农牧结合，粮食自给，甚至自给有余。公社化后，生产关系根本改变了，“农牧矛盾”的性质也发生了变化，发展农业成为全体人民的共同利益和共同要求。只要统筹兼顾，全面安排，就可以作到农业、牧业相辅相成，共同跃进。农业的大发展，也就为进一步发展畜牧业和工业提供了良好的条件。
    牧业区大量垦荒和农业大发展的胜利，充分证明省委提出的牧业区农业生产以大量开垦荒地、扩大耕地面积为主的方针，是完全正确的。证明“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”是牧业区人民公社唯一正确的经济方针。近几年来，特别是大跃进以来的事实充分证明，牧业区绝大多数地方是可以种植粮食的，而且一般产量较高，是青海省的粮食高产区。1958年德令哈农场就创造了万亩小麦平均亩产超千斤的奇迹，赛什克农场创造了小麦亩产八千五百八十五斤的高产纪录；1959年在全省千斤以上的四万七千亩的高额丰产田中，牧业区就占四万二千亩。许多农场，第一年开荒种地，就获得了亩产四百斤、五百斤甚至千斤以上的高额丰产。这说明在牧业区大量开垦荒地，是青海省迅速发展农业生产的一条多快好省的途径。同时，事实也进一步证明，牧业区人民公社只要认真贯彻执行“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针，统一规划，合理安排耕地和牧场，农业的发展，绝不会影响畜牧业的发展，恰恰会有力地促进畜牧业的发展。例如实现了粮食自给有余的贵南县过马营公社直核大队，1958年耕地面积达到一万多亩，既种植了粮食作物，也种植了饲料、饲草，用麦草补饲了一千八百多头老、弱、孕、幼畜，保证了1959年牲畜净增28％，绵羊热配、一年双产也已试验成功。乌兰县茶卡公社经常固定60％的劳力从事畜牧业生产，24．86％的劳力搞农业生产，其余作为机动力量。牧业忙季搞牧业，农业忙季搞农业，平时大搞副业，既迅速发展了农业，使1958年播种面积达二千三百余亩，实现了粮食自给有余；又大大促进了畜牧业的发展，1958年冬与1959年春就给牲畜补饲草近百万斤，青稞、燕麦二万五千斤，保证了1959年牲畜净增21％。
    牧业区发展农业的政治意义和经济意义
    牧业区大力发展农业，大量开垦荒地，有着极其深远的政治意义和经济意义。现在广大牧业区，开始形成大片大片的农业区，建立了一些粮食生产基地，正在改变着青海省的农业布局，根本结束了以往广大牧业区单一畜牧业经济的历史，也开始改变着畜牧业单纯依靠自然放牧的落后经营方式。大批国营农场、牧场的建立和实行机械垦荒，大大加强了全民所有制的经济成分，开始了农业的技术革命。农业的丰收，进一步提高了广大干部和各族农牧民群众发展农业生产的信心和决心；证实了大量开垦荒地、扩大耕地面积，是青海省高速度发展农业生产的主要途径。现在，大抓农业，大量增产粮食，已经成为青海省各级党组织同全体人民的共同思想，成为广大群众的自觉行动。农业大发展的新局面，已经形成，农业建设史上，新的灿烂的一页已经揭开。
    青海省广大牧业区，地区辽阔，土地肥沃，可资利用的水源很多，初步调查，约有可垦荒地四千余万亩。只要大量开垦种植，对发展牧业区经济，有着极其重大的意义。农业是国民经济的基础，只有农业的大发展，粮食大增产，才能高速度地发展畜牧业、工业、交通运输业，也才能迅速发展文教卫生事业。这点，已经愈来愈被事实所证明，也愈来愈被多数同志所理解。要根本改变牧业区的经济面貌，要使少数民族跻于先进民族的行列，改变事实上的不平等状况，必须大力发展牧业区现代工业，培养本民族的无产阶级队伍。青海省牧业区矿藏资源非常丰富，矿种多，储量大，分布广，已经发现的有七十余种，可以说是县县有矿、到处有矿，工业发展前途极大，完全有可能成为祖国的石油、化学、有色金属、黑色金属基地之一。但是，由于青海省人口较少，要大规模地发展工业，就必须大量移入人口，而人口的大量增加，又需要有足够的粮食供应。因此，大量开垦荒地，就地生产粮食、蔬菜，就成为发展工业的首要条件，否则势必影响工业的迅速发展。如柴达木地区近几年来由于石油等工业的迅速发展，人口激增，粮食、蔬菜需要的更多，几年来农业虽然发展很快，但仍然不能满足需要，每年还从外地调入大批粮食。同样，畜牧区要高速度发展，也必须与农业结合，就地生产粮食，建立巩固的饲草、饲料基地，逐步改变完全依靠自然放牧的经营方法。无数事实一再证明，牲畜在冬春缺草季节如能得到补饲，不但可以大大增强体质，抗御风雪寒冻，减少死亡，而且可以大大提高繁殖成活率，实现一年双产、一胎双羔。同时，牧业区也只有实行定居轮牧、农牧结合，才能更快地提高各族牧民群众的生活，迅速发展文教卫生事业，改变牧业区文化落后的状况。
    因此，坚决贯彻执行“扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量同时并举”的方针，全面安排劳动力，继续在牧业区大量开垦荒地，增产粮食，积极支援畜牧业的发展，并为大工业建设准备条件，就是青海省今后若干年内一项重要的政治任务和经济任务，也是牧业区各级党委的一项艰巨而光荣的使命。必须进一步加强对农业生产和垦荒工作的领导，教育干部认识大量垦荒、高速度发展农业生产的重大政治意义和经济意义，树立长期建设牧业区的思想，要有坚强的决心和毅力，不但在牧业区开荒种地，建立农场、牧场，而且要准备在牧业区修铁路、盖工厂，在无人区建立城市。柴达木地区的职工，已经给我们作出了良好的范例，其他地区的职工和农牧民群众，也应该急起直追，努力学习。目前，要切实把农业生产和垦荒工作紧紧地抓起来，在已经超额完成1959年垦荒三百万亩计划的基础上，乘胜猛进，争取1960年开垦更多的荒地，把牧业区早日建设成为青海省的主要粮食生产基地。
    当前的五项工作任务
    当前，我们要抓紧作好以下几项工作。首先进一步掀起以兴修水利和积肥造肥为中心的备耕高潮，尽量扩大农田灌溉面积，努力增加施肥量，并充分作好种子调运、工具准备、机具维修、耕畜饲养等备耕工作，保证原有耕地和新开荒地今春全部适时播种，不误农时。
    其次，要大力加强荒地、水源的勘察规划和农场的设计工作，进行全面规划，合理安排耕地和牧场，保证1960年及今后进一步扩大耕地面积的需要。切实作到农牧业互相结合，相辅相成，在保证畜牧业发展的同时，大量开垦荒地，发展农业。
    第三，进一步加强国营农场和机械垦荒队的领导。国营农场是牧业区农业生产的主力军。机械垦荒队是一支新生的力量，将随着国家工业的发展，逐渐成为牧业区垦荒的主力。因此，必须进一步加强领导，不断改善管理水平，提高现有机械利用率，发挥更大的作用。
    第四，加强成本核算，发扬勤俭办场的优良作风，提倡少花钱，多开荒，争取用同样的投资开垦更多的荒地。
    第五，进一步发动群众，大搞垦荒运动，社社开荒，队队种地，能种粮食的地区，都要努力实现粮食自给。牧业区所有机关、部队、学校、企业厂矿，也都要就地尽量开垦荒地，种植蔬菜、粮食，饲养家畜、家禽，有条件的要力争实现菜、肉、粮食三自给。牧业区所有人民公社和国营农、牧场，都要建立专业垦荒队，把常年垦荒和短期突击垦荒结合起来，把机械垦荒和人畜力垦荒结合起来。1960年和今后若干年内，都要在春耕后，田间管理大忙前和秋收后、春耕前，组织两次大规模的垦荒高潮，使牧业区的农业生产，以更快的速度，飞跃发展，争取更快地改变牧业区的面貌，把牧业区建设得更美丽、更富饶。
