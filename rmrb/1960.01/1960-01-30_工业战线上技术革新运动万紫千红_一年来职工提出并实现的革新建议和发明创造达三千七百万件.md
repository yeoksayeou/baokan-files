Xinhua News Agency, January 29th -- Xinhua News Agency commentator: The upsurge of the mass movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution on China's industrial front is coming with unstoppable force. At present, this upsurge has swept across all industries and enterprises in China's industry, transportation, and other sectors. In the movement, innovation pioneers are emerging in large numbers, and innovation fruits are blooming in myriad colors. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, the workers and masses on all fronts across the country have put forward and implemented a total of more than 37 million technical innovation proposals and inventions, exceeding the total accumulated in the previous few years before 1959. In the past year, 510,000 advanced collectives have emerged nationwide, an increase of more than 300,000 compared with 1958; 6.3 million advanced producers and advanced workers have emerged, an increase of more than 3.8 million compared with 1958. A large part of these advanced producers are outstanding technical innovation experts. The widespread and in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has enabled the labor productivity of many industries, many enterprises, many types of work, and many processes to increase by multiples, tens of times, or even dozens of times, enabling the production and construction plans of factories and mines to be completed ahead of schedule and ahead of target, and enabling China's socialist construction to achieve a continuous and great leap forward.

This technical innovation and technical revolution movement shows many gratifying and distinct characteristics. These are mainly: First, it has developed from single technical innovations to complete sets of technical innovations; second, it has developed from technical innovations of general tools and operations to mechanization, semi-mechanization, and even automation and semi-automation; third, it has developed from general technical innovations to tackling cutting-edge technologies; fourth, it has developed from individuals engaging in technical innovation to delivering technical innovation to people's doors, helping everyone to innovate together.

Systematically summarizing the many individual innovation projects that have emerged in technical innovation and innovating for weak links, so that innovation experience and innovation equipment become complete sets, is a sign of this movement developing from universal development to in-depth development. This can make the production levels of various types of work in an industry, or various processes for producing a product, adapt to each other, thereby achieving an increase in overall production efficiency. In the past year, many industries and many places have taken a big step in this regard. For example, in the steel industry, a complete set of advanced technical experience of the "twelve-character formula" for small blast furnace production has been summarized; the coal industry has summarized a complete set of advanced technical experience in mechanized coal mining, including all processes from slotting, blasting, coal falling to supporting and roof releasing. There are more complete sets of technical innovations in capital construction and transportation. Shenyang City has configured more than 8,300 sets, and Nanjing City alone has configured 346 sets in the construction sector.

Achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization to improve labor productivity, overcome the difficulties of labor shortage in the Great Leap Forward, and change the backward state of production, has enabled the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the past few months to move from a primary stage to an advanced stage. Cities such as Tianjin, Beijing, and Taiyuan are carrying out organized and led progress by industry and by type of work and process. Especially those departments, types of work, and processes that require a large amount of labor due to manual operation and are urgently needed for the Great Leap Forward in the national economy. Now, carrying on the back, lifting, carrying, and pulling have been replaced by cars, light rails, conveyor belts, and pipelines in many factories in Tianjin. From October 1st to the end of last year, Taiyuan City manufactured more than 31,000 sets of various indigenous and foreign transportation machinery, saving more than 24,000 laborers. All construction sites in Shenyang City have basically eliminated the backward phenomenon of carrying on shoulders. The canteen of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory manufactured ten kinds of catering machinery such as rice washing, dishwashing, noodle mixing, and vegetable cutting, reducing the number of catering staff by two-fifths. In the mechanization movement, not only a large number of general machinery have emerged, but also some machinery that has long been lacking and many machines with significant effects have appeared.

While the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement is being carried out, some modern factories in Harbin, Dalian, Luoyang, Chongqing, and other places have further directed the spearhead of technical innovation and technical revolution towards the realization of automation and semi-automation, finding an important direction for the Great Leap Forward in the production of modern enterprises. A batch of "automatic production lines" made by them using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods has transformed the work of producing certain parts or certain products from being operated by workers into being automatically and continuously processed by machine groups. The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory uses the "tap processing automatic line" to produce taps, which increases the output by seven times compared with the past production using single machines. The number of workers is reduced from seven to two, and the labor productivity is increased by twelve times. The concrete production linkage line created by Harbin construction workers links the processes of stone screening, stone washing, sand transportation, cement loading, weighing, and transportation in concrete production, and is automatically carried out by simple machinery. Only four people are needed to monitor on the operating table, which can replace the labor of 84 people. In addition to automatic production lines, many places are also widely carrying out the automation of single machine tools, so that parts that originally needed to be processed by several machine tools can be automatically and continuously completed by one machine tool.

In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the workers and masses realized that to make our poor and blank country a socialist advanced power quickly, we must have the ambition to climb the world's technological peaks. Therefore, they not only innovate general technology, but also want to conquer more cutting-edge technologies. In the past year, they have designed and manufactured many high-efficiency and precision products at a rapid pace.

A large number of heroes and pioneers not only innovate themselves, but also realize that "one flower is not spring, a hundred flowers in bloom is spring." Therefore, they actively "deliver treasures and impart scriptures" and send technical innovations to other people's doors. In the past few months, industrial departments such as metallurgy and coal and cities such as Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou have organized advanced experience technical performance teams, advanced experience observation and dissemination teams, sowing teams, reporting groups, and roving performance groups to disseminate advanced technology and advanced experience to various factories and mines across the country or locally, spreading the seeds of technical innovation everywhere. The representatives from Beijing who attended the National "Heroes Meeting" enthusiastically helped other workers and put forward more than 22,000 innovation proposals with them in one month.

The vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement vividly shows that the spiritual outlook of China's working class is undergoing tremendous changes. In this movement, the broad masses of workers, with the spirit of "liberating their minds, breaking superstitions" and "continuous revolution," have greatly promoted the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, breaking the shackles of all stale technical theories and old ideas on them. The broad masses of workers have fully demonstrated with countless vivid examples that scientific theory comes from practice, and practice can constantly revise and enrich past scientific theory. For example, in the metallurgical industry, it has long been believed that increasing smelting intensity must consume more coke. This time, the advanced experience created in Benxi, Taiyuan, Anshan, and other places proves that increasing smelting intensity can simultaneously reduce coke consumption accordingly. Another example is in the textile industry, it has also long been believed that increasing the speed of the car to produce more yarn and cloth cannot achieve good savings. However, the advanced experience and advanced theory created by workers in Shanghai and Changzhou powerfully prove that this view is outdated.

In recent months, the workers and masses in the newest modern enterprises such as the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, Changchun Automobile Factory, and Luoyang Tractor Factory have used their great achievements in vigorously promoting automation to correct the technical ceiling theory that existed in some people in the past. They have proven with vivid facts that the development of science and technology is endless, and that technical innovation and technical revolution can not only provide timely help to small and medium-sized enterprises but also add glory to modern large enterprises.

    工业战线上技术革新运动万紫千红
    一年来职工提出并实现的革新建议和发明创造达三千七百万件
    新华社29日讯　新华社记者述评：我国工业战线上以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动的高潮正以一泻千里之势滚滚而来。目前这个高潮已经席卷我国工业、运输业等的各个行业、各个企业。在运动中，革新闯将风起云涌，革新果实万紫千红。据不完全统计，一年来，全国各个战线上的职工群众提出并已付诸实施的技术革新建议和发明创造共达三千七百多万件，超过1959年以前几年累积的总和。一年来，全国涌现出先进集体五十一万个，比1958年增加三十多万个；涌现出先进生产者和先进工作者六百三十万人，比1958年增加三百八十多万人。这些先进生产者中很大一部分是出色的技术革新能手。技术革新和技术革命运动广泛深入开展的结果，使许多行业、许多企业、许多工种、许多工序的劳动生产率成倍、成十倍甚至几十倍的提高，使厂矿企业的生产建设计划纷纷提前和超额完成，使我国社会主义建设获得持续不断的大跃进。
    这个技术革新和技术革命运动显示出了许多令人欢欣鼓舞的鲜明特点。这主要是：第一，从单项技术革新发展到了技术革新成套；第二，从对一般工具、操作的技术革新发展到了进行机械化、半机械化甚至自动化和半自动化；第三，从一般技术的革新发展到了攻尖端技术；第四，从个人搞技术革新发展到了把技术革新送上门，帮助大家一齐革新。
    把技术革新中涌现出来的许许多多单个革新项目系统地总结起来，并针对薄弱环节进行革新，使革新经验和革新机具成套，是这一次运动从普遍发展向纵深发展的标志。这样作可以使一个行业的各个工种，或生产一件产品的各个工序的生产水平互相适应，从而达到整个生产效率的提高。一年以来，许多行业和许多地方都在这方面跨出了一大步。如钢铁工业中，总结出了关于小高炉生产的“十二字诀”的一套完整的先进技术经验；煤炭工业总结出了机械化采煤中，包括从掏槽、爆破、落煤直到支柱、放顶等各个工序的一整套先进技术经验。基本建设和交通运输中，已经配成套的技术革新更多，沈阳市就配了八千三百多套，南京市只建筑部门就配了三百四十六套。
    实现机械化、半机械化，以提高劳动生产率，克服大跃进中劳力不足的困难，改变生产中的落后状况，使几个月来技术革新和技术革命运动由低级阶段走向了高级阶段。天津、北京、太原等城市都是逐行逐业按工种按工序在有组织有领导的进行。特别是那些由于手工操作需要大量占用劳力而在国民经济大跃进中又急需发展的部门、工种和工序。现在背、抬、扛、拉在天津市的许多工厂内已经为车子、轻轨、传送带、管道所代替。太原市从去年10月1日到年底，就制造出各种土、洋运输机械三万一千多台，节约劳动力二万四千多个。沈阳全市所有的施工现场，已经基本上消灭了肩挑人抬的落后现象。北京第一机床厂食堂制造了淘米、洗碗、和面、切菜等十种炊事机械，使炊事人员减少了五分之二。在机械化运动中，不仅大量涌现了一般的机具，而且出现了一些长期以来属于缺门的机械和许多有重大作用的机械。
    与机械化、半机械化运动开展的同时，哈尔滨、旅大、洛阳、重庆等地的部分现代化工厂更进一步把技术革新和技术革命的矛头引向了实现自动化和半自动化，为现代化企业生产大跃进找到了重要的发展方向。他们用土洋结合的办法制出的一批“生产自动线”，使生产某些零件或某些产品的工作，由工人进行操作变成了由机器群自动连续地进行加工。哈尔滨量具刃具厂用“丝锥加工自动线”生产丝锥，比过去用单机生产，产量提高了七倍，工人由七人减为二人，劳动生产率提高了十二倍。哈尔滨建筑职工创造的混凝土生产联动线使混凝土生产中的筛石、洗石、运砂、上水泥、过秤、运输等工序联结起来，由简易机械自动进行，只要四个人在操纵台上监视，就可以代替八十四人劳动。除了生产自动线以外，许多地方还在广泛进行单机床的自动化，使原来需要经过几台机床加工的零件由一台机床自动连续完成。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，职工群众认识到要使我们这个一穷二白的国家，迅速成为社会主义先进强国，必需要有攀登世界技术高峰的壮志雄心，因而他们不仅革新一般技术，而且要攻下更多的尖端技术。一年来，他们以飞快的速度设计和制造出了许多高效率的、精密的产品。
    大批的英雄、闯将们不仅自己搞革新，而且认识到“一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春”，因而积极地“送宝传经”，把技术革新送到别人的门上。几个月来冶金、煤炭等工业部门和武汉、广州、杭州等城市都组织了先进经验技术表演队、先进经验观摩传播队、播种队、报告团、巡回表演组等到全国各地或本地各厂矿去传播先进技术和先进经验，遍撒技术革新的种子。北京市出席全国“群英会”的代表，热诚帮助其他职工，在一个月内就和他们一道提出了二万二千多项革新建议。
    技术革新和技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，生动地表明我国工人阶级的精神面貌正在发生巨大的变化。广大职工群众在这个运动中以“解放思想，破除迷信”和“不断革命”的精神，大大发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，打破了一切陈腐的技术理论和旧观点旧思想对他们的束缚。广大职工群众用无数生动的事例，充分证明科学理论来源于实践，实践可以不断地修正和丰富过去的科学理论。如在冶金工业中过去长期以来认为提高冶炼强度必然要多消耗焦炭，这一次本溪、太原、鞍山等地创造的先进经验证明，提高冶炼强度可以同时相应地降低焦炭的消耗。又如纺织工业中也是长期以来认为提高车速多产纱布就作不到好省，但是，上海和常州的工人创造的先进经验和先进理论，有力地证明这个观点已经过时。
    近几个月来，哈尔滨量具刃具厂、长春汽车厂、洛阳拖拉机厂等最新的现代化企业中的职工群众，用他们大搞自动化的巨大成就，纠正了过去有些人中存在的技术到顶论。他们以生动的事实证明科学技术的发展永无止境，技术革新和技术革命不仅可以为一般的中小企业雪里送炭，同样可以为现代化的大企业锦上添花。
