Ice and Snow World
By our reporters Yang Kexian and Tan Feng

Flying over the Tianshan Mountains, all one sees are snow-capped peaks, like a boundless expanse of silver waves.

People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have a special feeling for the snow mountains. "A drop of water, a drop of blood," they cherish water as much as life itself. The Tianshan Mountains, with their year-round snow, thicken year after year and melt year after year, bringing water to the forests, grasslands, oases, and to the people of all ethnic groups in the rain-scarce Xinjiang region. The majority of the large and small rivers in Xinjiang, with an annual flow of over 80 billion cubic meters, are supplied by glaciers and snow. When farmland suffers from drought, farmers look to the sky, hoping the sun will be even hotter, so that within a few days, a large amount of mountain snow and ice will melt, rivers will surge, and crops will be relieved from drought. But when floods and storms endanger villages and cities, people hope that the snow mountains will melt more slowly! Yet for thousands of years, the changes in the snow mountains, which are related to their lives and property, have remained a "mystery" to people.

In order to clarify the ice and snow resources of Xinjiang, to investigate the relationship between glaciers and river recharge, and to study the possibility of artificial snow production, a hundred scientists from the Xinjiang Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' High Mountain Ice and Snow Utilization Research Team, carrying scientific instruments, high-mountain equipment, and rations, entered the ice and snow world of the Tianshan Mountains to conduct scientific research activities. They are jointly composed of research units, universities, and local industrial departments from all over the country.

This is a young scientific team with an average age of less than twenty-five. Except for thirty-odd people who participated in China's first glacier expedition in 1958—the glacier expedition to the Qilian Mountains in Gansu—most people are entering the ice and snow world for the first time. They work under the guidance of Soviet glacier expert Comrade Dolgushin. This international friend, nearly fifty years old, was among the first Soviet people to visit the South Pole. He has dedicated his life to glacier exploration.

In mid-April 1959, all members of the glacier expedition team came to the snow-capped Victory Peak in the central Tianshan Mountains. Ten days of training gave them good high-altitude adaptability and mastered systematic ice and snow operation techniques. Then, divided into seven groups, they marched towards the Tengri Snow Mountain, 7,000 meters above sea level on the western Sino-Soviet border, the Haliktao Snow Mountain at the upper reaches of the Weigan River, the Yilian Habierdo Snow Mountain at the source of the Manas River, the Bogda Snow Mountain east of Urumqi, and the snow mountains north of Hami, such as the Barku Mountain and Karlik Mountain. Sometimes they crossed rapid and roaring rivers, and sometimes they climbed steep and rugged mountain roads. Along the dangerous paths across the large glaciers, the corpses of donkeys and horses that had fallen and died after slipping from the ice slopes lay scattered. But all this could neither frighten them nor stop them from advancing.

When the second detachment, which reached the upper reaches of the Weigan River, was crossing the Kasblan River, the roaring river, carrying mud, sand, and rolling stones, rushed down, making the horses unable to stand firmly. A horse was knocked down into the river by the mud waves, and the second detachment leader, Liu Zhenzhong, who was riding the horse, was washed away by the water, still carrying data, instruments, and cameras on his back. At this critical moment, Zhou Texian, a fourth-year student from the Department of Geography at Peking University, jumped into the rapids and struggled to rescue him. On another occasion, the freezing meltwater flood swept away a team member named Ma Guangyi, along with his horse, rolling them more than 100 meters in the sub-zero "over-cold water," causing the team member to fall ill for several days. But whenever he regained consciousness, his first thought was "Advance"!

The most difficult task was climbing the snow mountains at the source of the Manas River for the fourth detachment. More than a dozen of them went upstream from the Tashi River west of the Manas River for the first time. After entering the deep mountains, they were unexpectedly blocked by abrupt cliffs. The second time, they changed course and went upstream against the Manas River, crossing countless steep slopes and snow beaches to reach the end of the glacier, where they found a large "snow basin" with soft and accumulating snow. The horses sank several times into more than one meter of snow and had to be lifted out. Even in this difficult situation, they did not give up a glimmer of hope. Tian Zesheng and Zhen Yingqi, the leaders of this detachment, took ice axes and lightly climbed into the snow basin to explore the way. It took them four full hours to advance one kilometer, and ahead of them were still endless rolling snow hills and snow slopes. Obviously, this was a dead end. The exploration yielded no results, but they were not discouraged. The third time, they detoured through Xinyuan County in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, and after a long journey of nearly a thousand kilometers, they finally climbed the glacier area at the source of the Manas River from the back.

Without a strong will and a strong body, it would be difficult to climb to the cold, oxygen-deficient, and low-pressure ice and snow world. In the sweltering summer when people are sweating like rain, they wear thick down clothes and trousers, wear leather hats, and swallow cold food. Every morning when they came out of the tent, their feet seemed to be frozen in their boots, but the expectations of the Party and the people turned them into fearless warriors, welcoming all difficulties and carrying out various arduous tasks in the ice and snow world.

Once people open the door to the ice and snow world, they find that the ice peaks and snow ridges are a colorful world. Not to mention the exotic snow lotus, the rare snow chickens, and the brown bears, the glacier exploration team has walked across hundreds of glaciers and found that the glaciers on each peak are so different, even though they belong to the same Tianshan mountain range.

The Tianshan Mountains are a famous region for mountain glaciers in the world. In the western part where the high peaks are connected, the glaciers are so numerous that they resemble starlight in all directions. The longest glacier under the Tengri Mountains, the Kalagyuyle Glacier, is 34 kilometers long. Most of these glaciers are dendritic valley glaciers. They are made up of tens of thousands of small glaciers squeezed together, carrying rockfalls from the snow mountains, embedded in the valleys, and constantly pushed down the mountains. The further east the Tianshan Mountains go, the more discontinuous the distribution of glaciers along the mountain range of more than 1,700 kilometers. By the time they reach the Barku Mountains and Karlik Mountains north of Hami, the glaciers are generally only a few kilometers long. Most of them hang on the mountainsides and lie in the mountain depressions, with the ice surface like white clouds winding around the high places of the mountains. It is entirely a crystal glazed world.

People who have never seen glaciers easily associate them with frozen rivers. Only after climbing the ice mountains do they realize that glaciers are entirely formed by snow grains. Only under the thick snow grains, because of the pressure of the snow accumulation itself over thousands of years and the heating effect of freezing and melting, is a huge ice layer formed. This ice layer moves and flows downward along the mountain, and below the snow line, the degree of melting exceeds the accumulation, then it turns into flowing water and converges into rivers.

The Muzart Glacier area in the Tengri Mountains is the largest glacier area in the Tianshan Mountains. The ice storage here accounts for about one-third of the total known ice storage in the Chinese Tianshan mountain range. Scientific workers encountered a variety of wonderful glacier landscapes here. The ice forests formed by the melting of the ice surface, the ice bridges formed by the accumulation of snow across the ice ditches, the ice pillar groups formed by the melting and freezing under the ice rock, and the ice and underground rivers formed by the melting of glaciers all make people feel the magical beauty of nature.

Observing the movement speed of glaciers is a work that requires patience. Glaciers are constantly flowing, but so slowly that it is imperceptible to the naked eye. One can only set up markers on both banks and the ice surface and observe them day by day. They only move a dozen meters a year. The ice and snow exploration team found "dead ice tongues" that had stopped flowing in the larger glaciers in the Tengri Mountains and Muzart Glacier area. The dead ice is covered with moraine stones, and there is no sign of glacier movement. Only due to the ablation of the ice body, the ice water seeps out and gathers in the depressions on the ice surface, forming ice lakes like large mirrors with a deep blue color. In some places, ice water flows into unfathomable ice wells.

After summer, the high mountain glaciers become a restricted area. In order to solve the complex problems of the distribution, movement, water storage, and rational utilization of modern glaciers in the Tianshan Mountains before the snow closes the mountains, the members of the exploration team must strive to obtain rich scientific data through various measurements and investigations as much as possible before mid-August. They often struggled to advance in snow that was chest-deep, and the high mountain blizzards attacked them, but the work continued as usual.

Once, hail mixed with snowflakes fell continuously on the Bogda Snow Mountain. In order to save time, the fifth detachment still went to investigate a "grain snow basin." They avoided countless ice cracks, but accidentally stepped on floating snow, and the snow under their feet gradually collapsed. The legs of one person in front fell into a dark crack, and when he was about to fall headfirst, the person behind him immediately pulled him hard, and only then was the danger averted. There were only three female team members in the entire glacier exploration team. They worked alongside the male team members, drinking ice and sleeping in the snow, and persevered in their work. Mu Congru, a female student from the Department of Geography at Lanzhou University, served as the observer of the third detachment. She personally set up a station on the ice surface, measuring the rules of water changes in the ice surface river channels day and night, and helped the meteorological team to conduct observations. One night, it was snowing heavily, and she was afraid that the instruments would be buried in the snow. She braved the midnight blizzard and finally found the instruments, obtaining extremely valuable meteorological data for that night.

After more than three months of field investigation, the glacier exploration team has achieved rich results. The ice storage of the Tianshan Mountains is much larger than expected. The ice storage of the glaciers reached by the exploration team is about 88.3 billion cubic meters, of which the largest Muzart Glacier area has an ice storage of 37.5 billion cubic meters. How exciting it sounds, but this is only a part of the Tianshan glaciers. Here, every snow mountain is a huge natural reservoir. (Attached pictures)

    冰雪世界
    本报记者  杨克现  谈风
    乘飞机越过天山，只见山峰积雪皑皑，如同一望无际的银色波涛。
    新疆各族农牧民对于雪山有一种特殊的感情。“一滴水，一滴血”，他们把水看得像生命一样宝贵。那四季飞雪的天山，年年不断增厚，年年不断融解，把流水带给了森林、草原、绿洲，带给了缺雨的新疆地区的各族人民。全疆年流量达八百亿多公方的大小河流，多数是靠冰川积雪补给的。当农田受旱的时候，农民们望着天空，盼望太阳更加炙热，这样不出几天，高山冰雪大量融化，就会出现河水奔流，庄稼解旱的景象。而当洪水、暴雨危及村庄和城市的时候，人们又多么希望雪山慢一点融解啊！可是几千年来，人们对于那关系着自己生命财产的雪山变化，始终是一个“谜”。
    为了弄清新疆的冰雪资源，查明冰川与河流的补给关系，研究人工化雪的可能性，几个月来，中国科学院高山冰雪利用研究队新疆队一百名科学工作者，背着科学仪器，带着高山装备和干粮，进入了天山冰雪世界，展开科学研究活动。他们是由全国各地的研究单位、高等学校和地方有关产业部门共同组成的。
    这是一支年轻的科学队伍，平均年龄还不到二十五岁，除了三十多名参加过1958年我国第一次冰川考察——甘肃祁连山冰川考察工作外，大多数人还是第一次进入冰雪世界。他们在苏联冰川专家道尔古辛同志的指导下工作。这位年近五十岁的国际友人，是第一批到过南极的苏维埃人，他把毕生精力献给冰川考察工作。
    1959年4月中旬，冰川考察队的全体人员，一齐来到天山中部的雪峰胜利大坂。为期十天的锻炼，使他们获得了良好的高山适应性，掌握了系统的冰雪作业技术。然后分成七路，向西面中苏边界拔海七千米的腾格里雪山，向渭干河上源的哈雷克套雪山，向玛纳斯河源的伊连哈比尔朵雪山，向乌鲁木齐东面的博格多雪山和哈密以北的巴尔库山喀尔里克山等雪山前进。他们有时横渡急湍咆哮的河水，有时要攀登峭壁千丈的崎岖山路。在那越过大冰川的险道旁，沿途横三倒四地躺着因从冰坡滑下摔死的驴马尸体。但是这一切既不能吓倒他们，也不能阻止他们前进。
    到达渭干河上源的第二分队在越过卡斯布朗河的时候，咆哮的河水，带着泥沙滚石冲击而下，冲撞得马匹站立不稳。一匹马被泥浪掀倒在河水里了，骑在马上的第二分队长刘振中被水冲去，他身上还背着资料、仪器和照相机。在这个千钧一发的时候，北京大学地理系四年级学生周特先跳到激流中，奋力抢救他出来。又有一次，刺骨的融冰洪水，竟把一个名叫马光义的队员，连人带马卷走，在零下一度的“过寒水”里，滚了一百多米远，冻的这个队员生了几天病。可是每当他清醒的时候，第一个念头便是“前进”！
    最困难的要算是攀登玛纳斯河上源雪山的第四分队了。他们十多个人第一次从玛纳斯河西面的塔西河上行，在进入深山以后，不料被突兀的山崖阻断了去路，第二次改道溯玛纳斯河逆流而上，越过无数的陡坡和雪滩到达冰川尾部，发现前进道路上是一片积雪松软的大“雪盆”，马匹数度陷入一米多深的雪中，不得不抬着出来。即使在这种困难情况下，他们也不放过一线希望，这个分队的负责人田泽生和甄英岐带着冰镐，轻装爬进雪盆探路，整整四个小时才前进了一千米，而横在前面的仍是望不到尽头的起伏不平的雪丘和雪坡。显然这是一条绝路。探路没有结果，但他们并没有灰心。第三次，他们绕道伊犁哈萨克族自治州的新源县，经过近千公里的长途跋涉，终于从背面登上了玛纳斯河源头冰川区。
    没有坚强的意志和坚强的身体是难以攀登到那严寒、缺氧、低压的冰雪世界的。在人们挥汗如雨的盛夏，他们却穿着厚厚的鸭绒衣裤、带着皮帽，吞着冰冷的食物。每天早上一出帐篷，脚就仿佛已冻在靴子上了，但是一想到党和人民的期望，使他们又变成无畏的战士，迎接着一切困难，在冰雪世界开展各种繁重的工作。
    当人们一旦打开冰雪世界的大门，才发觉冰峰雪岭之中，却是一片五光十色的天地。且不说那奇异的雪莲、罕见的雪鸡和哈熊，冰川考察队走过数百条冰川，发现同是一条天山山系，而各个山峰上的冰川竟是这样大不相同。
    天山是世界山岳冰川有名的地区。在西部高峰相连的地方，冰川之多，如星光四射，腾格里山下最长的卡拉格玉勒冰川，长达三十四公里。这些冰川多数是树枝状的山谷冰川。由千万个小冰山挤在一起，携带着雪山的崩石，镶在山谷，不断向山下推去。天山越往东行，沿途一千七百多公里的山岭上，冰川断续分布，到了哈密北部的巴尔库山和喀尔里克山，冰川一般只有几公里长，它们大部悬在山腰上和伏在山凹里，冰面像一朵一朵白云盘在山的高处。完全是一种水晶琉璃世界。
    没有见过冰川的人，很容易联想到冰川是冻结的河流，登上冰山，才知道冰川完全是由雪粒形成的。只有在厚厚的雪粒下面，因为千百年积雪自身的压力和时冻时融的热力作用形成了巨大冰层，这种冰层顺山势向下推移流动，到雪线以下，融解的程度超过了积累，则化为流水，汇成河流。
    腾格里山的木札尔特冰川区是天山最大的冰川区。这里的储冰量约占中国天山山系已知储冰总量的三分之一左右。科学工作者在这里碰到了丰富多采的冰川奇景。那由冰面融解而形成的冰林，那积雪横搭在冰沟上而形成的冰桥，那冰岩下刚刚融解而又结冰所形成的冰柱群，那因冰川融解汇集成的冰上和冰下河流，无一不使人感到大自然的神奇美妙。
    考察冰川的运动速度是一件需要耐性的工作。冰川不断地在流动，却慢的叫人用肉眼觉察不出来，只能在两岸和冰面立好标记，逐日观察，一年不过移动十几米。冰雪考察队在腾格里山和木札尔特冰川区的较大冰川上，发现有停止流动的“死冰舌”，死冰上面复满碛石，不见冰川的流动迹象。只是由于冰体的消融，冰水渗出汇集在冰面凹地里，形成一面一面湛蓝色大镜子一样的冰湖，有的地方冰水流泻入深不可测的冰井中。
    过了夏季，高山冰川上便成了禁区。为了在大雪封山之前解决天山现代冰川的分布概况、运动、储水量、冰雪资源合理利用等复杂问题，考察队人员必须争取在8月中旬以前，尽可能地通过多种测量、考察，取得丰富的科学资料。他们经常在深可及胸的积雪中挣扎前进，高山暴风雪袭击他们，工作仍是照常进行。
    有一次，博格多雪山冰雹加着雪花不住地下着，第五分队为了争取时间，仍然去考察一个“粒雪盆”。他们避过了无数冰裂缝，不料误踏浮雪，脚下积雪逐渐陷落，前面一个人两条腿便掉进一个黑暗的裂缝中，快要连头陷下去的时候，后面一个人立刻使劲拖住他，才挽救出险。整个冰川考察队中只有三个女队员，她们和男队员一起，饮冰卧雪地，坚持工作。兰州大学地理系女学生穆从如，担任第三分队的观测员，亲自在冰面上设站，日夜测量着冰面河道水情变化的规律，并帮助气象组进行观测。有一天夜间，大雪纷飞，她深怕仪器被雪埋住，冒着午夜大风雪，终于找到了仪器，获得了当晚极其宝贵的气象资料。
    冰川考察队经过三个多月的实地考察，获得了丰富的成绩，原来天山冰川的储量比设想的要大得多。考察队所到达的冰川，储水量约达八百八十三亿多公方，其中最大的木札尔特冰川区，储水量达到三百七十五亿公方，听起来多么令人兴奋，然而这还不过是天山冰川的一部分，在这里，每一座雪山便是一个巨大的天然水库。（附图片）
