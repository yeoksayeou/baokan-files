(Reported by this newspaper) The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has decided to promote a number of significant advanced experiences in 1960 to further improve the technical level of the steel industry and promote a continued leap forward in production. These significant advanced experiences are the fruitful results achieved by China's steel industry departments in 1959 under the leadership of the Party, implementing the principle of putting politics in command, and launching vigorous mass movements.

These significant advanced experiences include the production of ironmaking, steelmaking, steel rolling, and coke and refractory materials. The main ones are: the operational experience of large and medium-sized blast furnaces in increasing smelting intensity and simultaneously reducing coke ratio, multi-nozzle combustion of hot blast stoves in small blast furnaces, multi-taphole and multi-ladle tapping in open-hearth furnaces, non-baking furnace steelmaking in converters, and mixed steelmaking of converters and electric furnaces, open-hearth furnaces and electric furnaces, etc., which played a huge role in achieving high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safe production in China's steel production in 1959.

In 1959, China's ironmaking technology progressed rapidly. In terms of large and medium-sized blast furnaces, the advanced experience of "increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio simultaneously" created by ironmaking workers in Benxi, Taiyuan, Anshan, and other places has been widely promoted in large and medium-sized blast furnaces across the country. The bold implementation of this experience broke the long-held technical view that increasing smelting intensity would inevitably consume more coke. Practice has proved that it has greatly increased pig iron production and correspondingly reduced coke consumption. In November 1959, the utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide increased by approximately 30% compared to January. The average utilization coefficient of the nine large and medium-sized blast furnaces ranked among the advanced blast furnaces in the country reached above two. In November, the average amount of coke consumed per ton of iron produced by large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide was also reduced by about 100 kilograms compared to January. In order to promote this advanced technical experience, large and medium-sized blast furnaces in various regions have adopted various technical measures centered on large air volume and high air temperature, improved the quality of raw materials such as iron ore and coke, and improved equipment such as hoists, pig casting machines, furnace front equipment, and hot blast stove systems to meet the new demands placed on the original equipment after the increase in smelting intensity.

Another new productive force on the ironmaking front is the leap-forward development of small blast furnace ironmaking technology. In less than a year in 1959, China had created a complete set of small blast furnace production experience, and small blast furnace workers in various regions had basically overcome the "technical hurdles." This set of experience is the twelve-character formula called by small blast furnace workers: wash (coal for coking must be washed), select (iron ore must be selected and washed), small (raw material particle size must be small), large (increase air volume), high (increase air temperature), and other twelve experiences.

In 1959, various regions continuously summarized and exchanged the creative experience of small blast furnace workers, which rapidly changed the production outlook of small blast furnaces. By November, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces nationwide had increased from about 0.6 in the first quarter to 0.9, and the qualified rate of pig iron had increased to about 80%. Among them, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in five provinces reached above one, and the monthly average utilization coefficient of Anhui and Shandong provinces reached 1.29. The qualified rate of pig iron in eight major iron-producing provinces reached above 90%. Judging from the speed of increase in the utilization coefficient, small blast furnaces have achieved the level achieved by large and medium-sized blast furnaces in the three years from 1949 to 1951 with one year of effort.

In 1959, new converters were widely built in more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, and the proportion of converter steel production in the country's steel production increased rapidly. Converter steelmaking technology also made significant progress. For example, the use of hot-air alkaline iron furnace desulfurization, rapid furnace lining, non-baking furnace steelmaking, and non-stop air charging were all major new experiences and new technologies created by converter steelmaking workers in 1959. These experiences have had immediate effects on increasing the output and quality of converter steel and reducing raw material consumption.

More than a year ago, the three-taphole tapping of open-hearth furnaces pioneered by workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company sounded the call for a technical revolution in open-hearth steelmaking. In 1959, this advanced technology has not only been implemented in many open-hearth steelmaking plants, but has also been developed more completely. In order to meet the needs of increased steel production after multi-taphole tapping, many steel plants have promoted various types of ground ingot casting machines. With this ground ingot casting machine, the increased steel can be quickly transported and cast into steel ingots without increasing crane equipment. The emergence of the ground ingot casting machine solved the problem that steel casting cranes could not keep up with multi-taphole tapping for a time. It and multi-taphole and multi-ladle tapping and expanding the capacity of open-hearth furnaces are combined to form an important measure to increase the output of open-hearth steel.

The widespread use of magnesia-alumina bricks to build open-hearth furnace roofs is also a major development in China's open-hearth steelmaking technology in 1959. This new type of refractory brick has a higher temperature resistance than the original silica bricks and has a longer life when built into the furnace roof. Therefore, it has greatly promoted the implementation of the advanced open-hearth steelmaking operation policy of "more charging, fast smelting, high temperature, and long life."

In terms of electric furnace steelmaking, the promotion of new smelting methods in 1959 greatly increased furnace output and saved electricity consumption. The average utilization coefficient of many electric furnaces has made new progress compared to 1958, and the monthly average utilization coefficient of some advanced steel plants has reached 45.

In 1959, steel rolling technology also improved significantly. Various types of rolling mills across the country have widely promoted the advanced experience of "multi-strand feeding, fast rolling" and "rolling large materials on small machines." This is a decisive factor in tapping the potential of existing rolling mills and rapidly increasing steel production in 1959.

Now, under the brilliant light of the general line, the workers on the steel industry front have stepped into 1960 with majestic strides. They are determined to create more abundant and colorful advanced experiences in the new year and raise the technical level of China's steel industry to a newer stage.

    运用去年先进经验　推动今年继续跃进
    冶金部大力推广新技术
    炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、炼焦、耐火材料一整套新技术将更加普及和提高
    本报讯　冶金工业部决定在1960年推广许多项重大先进经验，进一步提高钢铁工业的技术水平，促进生产继续跃进。这些重大先进经验，是1959年我国钢铁工业部门在党的领导下，贯彻执行政治挂帅和大搞群众运动所取得的丰硕果实。
    这些重大先进经验，包括炼铁、炼钢、轧钢和焦炭、耐火材料的生产。主要的有：大中型高炉的提高冶炼强度和同时降低焦比的操作经验，小高炉热风炉多咀燃烧，平炉上的多槽多罐出钢，转炉上的不烘炉炼钢以及转炉和电炉、平炉和电炉的混合炼钢等等，对于1959年我国钢铁生产获得高产、优质、低耗和安全生产，起了巨大的作用。
    1959年我国的炼铁技术进步得很快。在大中型高炉方面，本溪、太原、鞍山等地炼铁职工创造的“提高冶炼强度和降低焦比同时并举”的先进经验，已经在全国大中型高炉上普遍推广。这个经验的大胆推行，打破了长期以来认为提高冶炼强度必然要多消耗焦炭的技术观点，实践证明，它既大大提高了生铁产量，也相应地降低了焦炭消耗量。1959年11月份，全国大中型高炉的利用系数，比1月提高了约30％，列身于全国先进高炉行列的九座大中型高炉，利用系数平均都达到二以上；11月份全国大中型高炉每炼一吨铁平均消耗的焦炭量，也比1月份节省了一百公斤左右。各地的大中型高炉，为了推行这一先进技术经验，曾经采取了以大风量、高风温为中心的各种技术措施，改善铁矿石、焦炭等原料的质量，改进卷扬机、铸铁机、炉前设备和热风炉系统等设备，适应冶炼强度提高后对原有设备提出的新的需求。
    炼铁战线上的另一支新的生产力，是小高炉炼铁技术的飞跃发展。在1959年不到一年的时间里，我国已经创造出一套完整的小高炉生产经验，各地小高炉职工已经基本上闯过了“技术关”。这一套经验，就是被小高炉职工称为“十二字诀”的洗（炼焦用煤要洗）、选（铁矿石要选洗）、小（原料粒度要小）、大（加大风量）、高（提高风温）等十二项经验。
    1959年，各地由于不断总结和交流了小高炉职工创造性的经验，从而使小高炉的生产面貌迅速改观。到11月份止，全国小高炉的利用系数已经由第一季度的零点六左右提高到零点九，生铁合格率提高到了80％左右；其中有五个省的小高炉平均利用系数达到了一以上，安徽、山东两省的月平均利用系数达到了一点二九；八个主要产铁省的生铁合格率达到了90％以上。从利用系数提高的速度来看，小高炉以一年的努力就已经达到了大中高炉从1949年到1951年三年间所取得的水平。
    1959年，全国二十多个省、市、自治区普遍建设了新转炉，转炉钢产量占全国钢产量的比重迅速增长，转炉炼钢技术也随着有了显著的进步。例如，运用热风碱性化铁炉脱硫、快速砌炉、不烘炉炼钢和不停风加料等，都是转炉炼钢职工1959年内创造的重大新经验和新技术。这些经验对提高转炉钢的产量、质量和降低原料消耗，已经收到立竿见影之效。
    一年多以前，太原钢铁公司职工首创的平炉三槽出钢，吹响了平炉炼钢技术革命的号角，1959年，这个先进技术不仅已经在许多平炉炼钢厂里推行，而且发展得更加完备了。许多钢厂为适应多槽出钢后钢产量增加的需要，推广了多种不同型式的地行铸锭机，利用这种地行铸锭机，可以在不增天车设备的条件下，把增产的钢水迅速运走铸成钢锭。地行铸锭机的出现，解决了多槽出钢后铸钢天车一度赶不上的问题；它和多槽多罐出钢、扩大平炉的容量三者互相结合，成为一套提高平炉钢产量的重要措施。
    广泛使用镁铝砖砌筑平炉炉顶，也是1959年我国平炉炼钢技术的一大发展，这种新品种的耐火砖比原来使用的矽砖耐温能力高，砌成的炉顶寿命长，因而对贯彻“多装、快炼、高温、长寿”这样一套先进的平炉炼钢操作方针，起了很大的促进作用。
    在电炉炼钢方面，1959年由于推广了新的熔炼方法，大大地增加了炉产量，节约了电力消耗。许多电炉的平均利用系数比1958年有了新的进展，有些先进的钢铁厂月平均利用系数达到了四十五。
    1959年轧钢技术也有了显著提高，全国各种不同类型的轧钢机已经广泛地推行了“多条喂钢、快速轧制”和“小机轧大材”的先进经验。这是挖掘现有轧钢机的潜力、迅速增加1959年钢材产量的一个决定性因素。
    现在，钢铁工业战线的职工，在总路线的光辉照耀下，以雄伟的步伐跨进了1960年。他们决心在新的一年里创造出更加丰富多采的先进经验，把我国钢铁工业的技术水平提高到一个更新的阶段。
