Cultivating young actors is one of the important tasks to make China's drama cause more prosperous and developed.

The 24th issue of the 1959 "Drama Gazette" was a "Young Actor Special Issue," which introduced the experiences and gains of some opera, drama, and opera houses, troupes, and drama schools in Beijing, Sichuan, and other places in cultivating young actors in recent years through text and pictures. At the same time, through the interviews with some young actors who participated in the "Heroes Gathering," such as Xie Ruiqing of Peking Opera, Ma Lin of Henan Opera, and articles introducing other young actors of some other operas, it shows that every excellent young actor who is welcomed by the audience has been nurtured under the party's cordial care and guidance, and through the meticulous teaching of senior artists, they have continuously improved their political consciousness and worked hard. The editorial "Establish Lofty Aspirations, Surpass Predecessors, and Climb the Peak of Art" in this issue put forward further goals for young actors: First, to establish a communist worldview and strive to become communist fighters; second, to maintain close contact with workers, peasants and soldiers; third, to have a relatively high level of cultural and artistic accomplishment; fourth, to strengthen professional and technical learning and exercise, and master complex performing skills.

    “青年演员专号”
    培养青年演员，是使我国戏剧事业更加繁荣发展的重要工作之一。
    1959年第二十四期“戏剧报”是个“青年演员专号”，通过文字和图片，介绍了北京、四川等地一些戏曲、话剧、歌剧院、团和戏剧学校近年来在培养青年演员工作方面的经验和收获。同时，通过参加“群英会”的部分青年演员：如京剧的谢锐青、豫剧的马琳等人的访问记，和关于其他一些剧种青年演员的介绍文章，说明了每一个受到观众欢迎的优秀青年演员，都是在党的亲切关怀和教导下，经过前辈艺人的精心传授，不断提高了政治觉悟和刻苦钻研的结果。这一期编辑部的“立大志，超前辈，攀登艺术高峰”的社论，对青年演员提出了更进一步的努力目标：第一，要树立共产主义的世界观，努力使自己成为共产主义的战士；第二，同工农群众密切联系；第三，要有比较高的文化艺术修养；第四，加强专业技术学习和锻炼，掌握复杂的表演技巧。（楠）
