　　Spring comes early to the kitchen, welcoming the morning sun and accompanying the stars at night. Working diligently for ten thousand people, bowls of rice as white as jade, plates of delicious dishes filled with heartfelt sincerity. Everyone sings loudly about the Great Leap Forward, the entire factory is full of spring. Model workers are established on the food service front, and the variety of dishes is renewed daily. The variety of dishes is renewed daily, and the workers gain increased energy after eating, fiercely seizing double-red production leaps, delighting the cooks in the kitchen.

    春到伙房早迎朝霞夜伴星，辛辛苦苦为万人，碗碗米饭白如玉，盘盘佳肴一片心。人人高歌大跃进，全厂无处不是春，伙食线上标兵树，饭菜花样日日新。饭菜花样日日新，职工吃了干劲增，猛夺双红生产跃，喜煞伙房烹煮人。
