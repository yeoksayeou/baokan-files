Granny Writes a Letter to Her Dear Ones
The mountains are high, ah, the water is deep, Granny writes a letter to her dear ones.
High mountains and deep water, thinking of her dear ones, her dear ones are the People's Liberation Army.
Granny sits under the electric light, picking up her pen with a beaming smile.
The red checkered stationery gleams red, her heartfelt words written clearly:
People's Liberation Army, soldiers of the people,
Every New Year, we think of you,
Don't laugh at Granny's ugly handwriting,
Granny has just taken off her illiteracy hat.
In the past, even with a thousand words,
Granny couldn't say a word with her pen.
Now that we've turned over a new leaf with literacy,
We can ask if you're cold, we can ask if you're warm.
Picking up the pen, first to ask,
Is your health at peace?
Is work and study going well?
Mother wishes you to wear red flowers every year!
Dear ones, soldiers of the people,
Please rest assured about the rear,
Other things Granny can't say,
Granny will just praise the commune.
Praising the commune, ah, praising the commune,
The moment Granny mentions the commune, she's happy.
Our commune is like a pot of fire,
The scene rises day by day.
Our commune is like a pot of flowers,
Fresh every year, red every month.
Heaven is big, earth is big, but neither is very big,
Neither is as powerful as our commune.
Not afraid of old heaven causing disaster,
The commune has good years every year.
Granny is the commune's cook,
The better the days, the sweeter my heart.
The flowers are red, the fire is red, the days are good,
All thanks to our great leader Chairman Mao's good leadership.
The flowers are red, the fire is red, the days are beautiful,
All thanks to you for defending us.
A thousand words, ten thousand words are hard to write out completely,
The paper is too short, ah, the feelings are too deep!
Written full densely,
Granny squints her eyes and smiles.
Having written the letter, where to send it?
Granny thinks again and again.
The motherland's rivers and mountains are vast,
Everywhere are dear ones defending it.
Seven big characters written on the envelope: "Send to the heroic People's Liberation Army."

    大娘修书寄亲人
    李春山又高呵，水又深，大娘修书寄亲人。山高水深念亲人，亲人就是解放军。大娘电灯下边坐，拿起笔儿笑盈盈。红格格信纸闪闪红，知心话儿写分明：解放军，子弟兵，每逢过年惦你们，别笑大娘字写的丑，大娘是刚摘文盲帽。过去纵有千万句话，大娘提笔没法说。如今文化翻身啦，能问冷呵能问热。提起笔，先来问，你们的身体可安宁？工作学习都好吧？娘祝你们年年戴红花！亲人呵，子弟兵，后方的事儿请放心，别的事儿娘不会说，娘就会把公社夸。夸公社呵，夸公社，一提公社娘就乐。咱公社好比火一盆，光景天天往上升。咱公社好比花一盆，年年鲜呵月月红。天大、地大、都不大，都没有咱公社力量大。不怕老天闹灾情，公社年年是好年成。大娘是公社炊事员，好日子越过我心越甜。花红火红日子好，全凭咱毛主席的好领导。花红火红日子美，这全凭你们来保卫。千言万语难写尽，纸太短呵，情太深！密密麻麻写满了，大娘眯着两眼笑。写成信儿往哪儿寄？大娘想来又想去。祖国山河地方大，到处有亲人保卫他。七个大字写信封：“寄给英勇解放军。”
