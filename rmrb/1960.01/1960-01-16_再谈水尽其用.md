    Let's Talk About Making the Most of Water Again
    On November 23, 1959, this newspaper reported on the experience of the Limin Canal in Yicheng, Shanxi, and the Yudao River irrigation area in Fenyang in establishing a scientific water use system, creating an experience of irrigating 100,000 mu of land with one flow rate; at the same time, it published a commentary entitled "Rational Irrigation, Making the Most of Water". Today, it is reported that the Xinglongxia irrigation area in Yuzhong County, Gansu, has a record of irrigating 200,000 mu of land with one flow rate, which is twice as high as the irrigation efficiency of Limin Canal and Yudao River. These facts powerfully illustrate that there is enormous potential to be tapped in irrigation water use in various irrigation areas; it also shows that further improving irrigation management, increasing irrigation efficiency, and enabling every water conservancy project facility to exert its maximum effect can be achieved.
    The experiences of Xinglongxia and Limin Canal irrigation areas in improving irrigation efficiency have many things in common; and the experience of Xinglongxia irrigation area is richer and more improved. For example: making full use of winter slack water and summer floods to avoid wasting a single drop of water throughout the year; repairing and improving canal culvert projects to reduce water seepage and loss; repairing field projects, cultivating orchards, changing flood irrigation to furrow irrigation, and changing large furrows to small furrows; establishing a water use system and implementing planned water use, etc. are all common. However, in addition to adopting methods such as ice-breaking winter irrigation and flood interception irrigation, the Xinglongxia irrigation area has also adjusted the planting ratio of various crops according to the seasonal water volume, changing the phenomenon of excessive concentration of water demand for summer crops, which is a systematic and scientifically valuable experience. On the one hand, the Xinglongxia irrigation area reforms irrigation projects and irrigation methods to adapt to the needs of farmland cultivation; on the other hand, it changes the cultivation system and field management to adapt to the characteristics of water conservancy projects. This tightly integrates all aspects of water conservancy irrigation and agricultural production, playing a mutually reinforcing role.
    The experience of Xinglongxia irrigation area in improving irrigation efficiency once again proves that all work must adhere to putting politics in command and fully mobilize the masses. The masses have rich experience and infinite wisdom. As long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, do a good job in political and ideological work, fully mobilize the masses, and fight against old ideas and old habits, break the old and establish the new, the experience, wisdom, and strength of the masses can be fully utilized, and many effective methods that are in line with the actual situation of the local area and suitable for local needs can be devised to improve irrigation efficiency.
    At present, many old irrigation areas have some degree of unreasonable irrigation systems and canal leakage; new irrigation areas also have the phenomenon of some land not being leveled and field projects not being sound. As for irrigation management and scientific water use, there are more areas that need to be improved. Therefore, according to the specific conditions of your own region, learning from the experiences of Xinglongxia and Limin Canal, and seriously making some practical improvements and improvements in water storage, water management, and water use, irrigation efficiency can be greatly improved. Only by improving irrigation efficiency and irrigation quality can we fully utilize water resources, rationally irrigate the land in the irrigation area, and further expand the irrigated area.

    再谈水尽其用
    1959年11月23日，本报曾经报道过山西翼城利民渠和汾阳峪道河两灌区建立科学用水制度，创造一个流量浇地十万亩的经验；同时以“合理灌溉，水尽其用”为题发表评论。今天又报道了甘肃榆中县兴隆峡灌区折合一个流量浇地二十万亩的纪录，比利民渠和峪道河的灌溉效率又提高了一倍。这些事实有力地说明了各个灌区在灌溉用水方面，都有巨大的潜力可挖；也说明了进一步改进灌溉管理工作，提高灌溉效率，让每一项水利工程设施都发挥它的最大作用是能够做到的。
    兴隆峡和利民渠等灌区提高灌溉效率的经验，有很多共同之点；而兴隆峡灌区的经验，却更为丰富、更为提高了。例如：尽量利用冬闲水和夏季洪水，使一年四季一滴水也不糟塌；修整和健全渠道函闸工程，减少水的渗漏流失；修理田间工程，耕作园田化，改漫灌为畦浇，改大畦为小畦；建立用水制度，实行计划用水等等，都是共同的。但是，兴隆峡灌区除采用破冰冬灌和拦洪浇灌等办法外，还按照四季水量情况，调整了各种作物的种植比例，改变了夏禾需水过分集中的现象，更是一套系统的有科学价值的经验。兴隆峡灌区一方面改革灌溉工程和灌溉方法，使之适应农田耕作的需要；另一方面又改变耕作制度和田间管理，使之适应水利工程的特点。这样就使水利灌溉和农业生产的各个环节紧密地结合了起来，起到了相辅相成的作用。
    兴隆峡灌区提高灌溉效率的经验，又一次证明了一切工作都必须坚持政治挂帅，必须充分发动群众。群众的经验是丰富的，群众的智慧是无穷的。只要加强党的领导，作好政治思想工作，充分发动群众，并同旧思想、旧习惯作斗争，破旧立新，群众的经验、智慧和力量就能充分发挥出来，就能想出很多切合本地实际情况、适合本地需要的有效办法，提高灌溉效率。
    目前，很多老灌区都存在着某种程度的灌溉系统不合理、渠道渗漏等现象；新灌区也存在着部分土地没有平整，田间工程不健全等现象。至于灌溉管理和科学用水等方面，需要改进提高的地方就更多。因此，根据自己地区的具体情况，学习兴隆峡和利民渠等地的经验，认真地在蓄水、管水、用水等等方面作些切实的改进和提高的工作，灌溉效率就可能大大提高。只有提高了灌溉效率和灌溉质量，才可以充分利用水利资源，使灌区土地得到合理灌溉，并进一步扩大灌溉面积。
