The high tide of comprehensive development of animal husbandry focusing on pig raising for manure accumulation has arrived in the Xuchang area of Henan. At present, in addition to selling more than 429,000 pigs to the state, the area has 2,710,000 pigs in stock (83.9% collectively raised), an average of 1.82 pigs per household, an increase of 108% compared to the end of June 1959; 751,000 head of large livestock, a net increase of 5.8% compared to the end of June 1959; 9,182,000 domestic fowl, an increase of 18.9% compared to the end of June 1959; other animals such as domestic rabbits and bees have also developed greatly. The fastest development is in pigs, with a net increase of more than double in the entire area in just over five months, a phenomenon unprecedented in history. Currently, there is one commune in the area that has reached one pig per mu of land, 172 production brigades, and 1,177 production teams. At the same time, individual breeding by commune members has also increased accordingly.

What Road to Take

What road should be taken to develop animal husbandry production with pig raising as the main focus? This is the first question encountered in the movement, and it is also the fundamental question of whether animal husbandry can be developed more, faster, better, and more economically. The first focus of debate is: should we go all out, or should we do it on a small scale? Should we develop at a high speed, or should we develop at a low speed or not develop at all? Some comrades in mountainous areas believe that "mountainous areas have little land and poor soil, and little grain, and are only suitable for large-scale breeding of cattle and sheep, and are not suitable for large-scale pig raising." Some comrades in the plain areas also believe that "mountainous areas have a wide range of feed sources and little land, so it is not surprising to reach one pig per mu of land, but the plain areas have more land and fewer people, and it is impossible to do it just by calculating labor." Some comrades in economic crop areas also believe that "general grain-producing areas have more straw from various crops and are rich in grain, so they can develop greatly, but tobacco-producing areas cannot develop greatly." Facts have proved that these condition-only theories and pessimistic views are all lazy and cowardly ideas and are completely wrong. Lushan County has many mountains and large mountains, and is the county with the largest mountain area in the entire area, but it is the county with the most pigs among the seven mountainous counties. Zhangpo Brigade in Shangshui County in the plain area is one of the famous "five lakes and eighteen slopes" areas, which is often attacked by natural disasters, but it has reached an average of 1.3 pigs per mu of land in one year and nine months. Changge County has little land and many people, and many economic crops, but their pig raising is the most among the tobacco-producing counties, with 1.78 pigs per household. It can be seen that large-scale pig raising does not depend on objective conditions, but on whether the leadership has the determination.

Collective Breeding as the Main Focus? Or Decentralized Breeding by Commune Members as the Main Focus? Facts have proved that pig raising is indeed the same as other production undertakings, and organizing it can give play to its advantages and solve the various difficulties that cannot be solved by decentralized breeding. Collective breeding can strengthen the leadership, form professional teams, train specialized technical talents, and use manpower and materials in a unified way, which can retain more sows and achieve high-speed breeding; it can improve the level of management technology and avoid epidemic mortality; it can carry out large-scale tool reforms and implement semi-mechanization or mechanization, thereby greatly improving labor productivity.

"More, Faster, Better, Alive" in Breeding Piglets

To develop pig raising at a high speed, it is necessary to focus on breeding sows, and the following tasks must be done well to achieve "more, faster, better, alive", that is, retain more sows and produce more piglets; breed quickly and shorten the gestation period; promote excellent varieties and ensure good quality; and ensure that all piglets are born and live.

To carry out mass movements and launch large-scale debates to overcome superstitious and outdated ideas such as "pigs should not be mated on cloudy days" and "they can only give birth to two litters a year", and to improve the ideological level of the vast number of commune members and managers, is the first key to breeding piglets at high speed. Cadres and the masses should be educated to retain more sows, so that they are not castrated, not killed, and not left empty. For boars, they must be selected in a timely manner according to a certain proportion (requiring one for every twenty-five sows). At the same time, we must carry out large-scale technological innovation in mating, advocate hot mating, and promote advanced experiences such as double mating, re-mating, and artificial insemination. Hot mating is best done by mating on the second or third day after birth, preferably artificial insemination. If it is natural mating, attention should be paid to avoiding wind. After hot mating, the feeding and management of sows must be strengthened, and warm food should be fed after production; in order not to wean the sows, some concentrated feed should be fed appropriately, and calcium feed should be added to make the sows not wean within 20 days, and can promote the health of both mother and child. For sows that have not undergone hot mating, we must focus on timely mating, establish a file system, and promote advanced experiences such as old mating early, small mating late, and mating in the middle for those who are neither old nor small.

To raise piglets well, we must pass two hurdles: (1) The birth hurdle. When piglets are born, we must achieve "three completenesses, five preventions, and four preparations". The three completenesses are the safety of the sow's production, the survival of all the piglets, and the overall health of all the piglets; the five preventions are to prevent the sow from aborting, to prevent the sow from eating clothing or piglets (the sow should be fed more calcium), to prevent the piglets from getting umbilical cord wind after birth, to prevent the piglets from being crushed to death, and to prevent milk return (the sow should not be fed too much in the first two days after production, and some milk-throwing feed should be added); the four preparations are to prepare for childbirth (straw should not be used for bedding), to prepare for disinfecting the pigsty (with wormwood fire), to prepare for disinfecting knives and scissors, and to prepare feed. (2) The weaning hurdle. First of all, the piglets should be kept clean and hygienic at all times to prevent disease; secondly, the piglets should be fed thin soup and other feeds around half a month to practice eating early, and gradually weaned after 20 days; thirdly, the special management and special feeding work after weaning should be strengthened.

Collect Feed According to Local Conditions

As long as we follow the principle of relying on the mountains to eat mountains, relying on the water to eat water, and feeding locally, all types of areas have the conditions to raise pigs well. In mountainous areas, there are inexhaustible wild plants, which can be used as feed as long as they do not contain toxins. In plain areas, there are large amounts of crop stalks, stems, leaves, roots, and shells, as well as various tree leaves, weeds, and aquatic plants. Economic crop areas also have the characteristics of plain areas. In terms of comprehensive feed processing, the "Wuli" pig farm of the Guqiang People's Commune in Shangshui County has developed from a single pig farm to "one farm bringing six factories" in the past year, namely: a pig farm bringing a flour mill, a sugar factory, an oil mill, a fertilizer factory, a winery, and a vinegar factory. The pig farm collects the sweet potato braids, bean stalks, and sesame stalks from each team, and after processing and utilization, in addition to obtaining agricultural and sideline products, it also obtains a large amount of concentrated feed. In addition, the farm has also opened up 1,117 mu of feed base, which can harvest more than 6 million jin of hyacinth beans, pumpkins, carrots, and Swiss chard.

Manage Well and Feed Well

According to local experience, to do a good job in feeding management, we must achieve seven things:

First, the feed processing and treatment should be good. Feed processing must be fine, soft, clean, and cooked. We must universally promote the use of lime and gypsum to alkalize feed (add 12 taels of lime or 6 taels of alkali noodles per 100 jin of feed) and calcify it to make the feed ferment, soften, sour, and sweet.

Second, the feed should be well proportioned. First of all, we must do a good job in variety allocation, so that pigs eat a variety of foods, not just one kind of grass. Secondly, we must understand the properties of plants and match cool (willow leaves, Vitex leaves, young vegetables, etc.), hot (elm leaves, Bupleurum leaves, Zha grass, etc.), and neutral (creepers, ghost willow leaves, etc.) feeds. Thirdly, we must adjust the acidity and sweetness when feeding, and we must make a large amount of five-spice flour, which is made by frying peanut skins, corn cobs, and cottonseed hulls in a pot and crushing them, so that they smell fragrant and can increase the pig's appetite.

Third, the season should be well grasped. Feed warm food in winter, feed more hot feed, feed less cool feed, and feed more food that is neither thin nor thick; feed cool feed appropriately in summer, feed thin food first and then thick food, drink more water, and take more baths; cooked food should be fed all year round.

Fourth, implement the "three requirements" well. The three requirements are: first, quantify (quantify according to head). Second, implement "three additions and three no-feeding", that is, add frequently, add more, and add after eating; do not feed if the feed is not processed well, do not feed if it is not clean, and do not feed if it is not time. Third, do a good job of "five cares", that is, take care of sick pigs, disabled pigs, sows before and after production, piglets, and timid pigs separately.

Fifth, classify and manage groups well, that is, implement the "six-group" and "four-category" feeding methods. "Six-group" means dividing pregnant pigs, pigs one month before production, old sows with piglets, piglets, breeding pigs, and meat pigs into six groups for management. Each group is then divided into four categories according to size (including weak ones), bad personality, and illness, and fed in circles.

Sixth, implement the responsibility system well. To strengthen feeding management, we must establish a strict responsibility system, generally implementing "three guarantees, five quotas, and one reward". The three guarantees are to guarantee breeding (including conception rate, breeding rate, and survival rate), to guarantee weight gain, and to guarantee manure accumulation; the five quotas are: determine the number of heads (each person is required to feed 80 to 100 heads), determine the feed, determine the pens, determine the tools, and determine the work points; those who exceed the quota will be rewarded.

Seventh, prevent epidemics well. To do a good job in epidemic prevention, we must resolutely implement the policy of prevention first and treatment as a supplement. We must establish a strict sanitary and epidemic prevention system during prevention. Treatment should be based on local methods, and a combination of local and foreign methods. The feeders are required to achieve "four abilities": able to carry out sanitation and epidemic prevention, able to distinguish the condition, able to use local methods to treat diseases, and able to inject. In addition to doing a good job in cleaning and hygiene, we must strictly implement four inspections and two isolations. The four inspections are: check the cleanliness of the pens every day, check the feces, check the redness of the eyes, and check the temperature; the two isolations are: isolate sick pigs and isolate and examine new pigs entering the market. In addition, when epidemics are prevalent, grazing should be stopped.

Strengthen Leadership

Wherever political command is implemented and mass movements are carried out on a large scale, the pig raising movement develops rapidly. Therefore, the first secretaries of party committees at all levels must personally take action and put pig raising and manure accumulation on the important agenda.

Establishing a professional pig raising team is an extremely important link. The feeders must be commune members with good composition, active in production, not afraid of hardship, ideologically advanced, and love pig raising. The organizational structure within the pig farm must be sound. Generally, there should be a party and Communist Youth League branch, and a farm affairs committee with four sections: breeding, feeding management, feed processing, and epidemic prevention.

    处处都能高速度发展养猪事业
    中共许昌地委书记处书记　马金铭
    河南许昌地区以养猪积肥为主的畜牧业全面发展的高潮已经到来。目前全区养猪除卖给国家四十二万九千多头外，存栏猪二百七十一万头（集体喂养占83．9％），平均每一农户一点八二头，比1959年6月底增加108％；大家畜七十五万一千头，比1959年6月底净增5．8％。小家禽九百一十八万二千只，比1959年6月底增加18．9％；其它如家兔、蜜蜂等也有很大的发展。发展最快的是猪，全区五个多月时间，净增超过一倍，这是历史上从来没有过的现象。现在全区达到一亩地一头猪的公社一个，生产大队一百七十二个，生产小队一千一百七十七个。同时，社员私人喂养也相应地有所增加。
    走什么样的道路
    发展以养猪为主的畜牧业生产，究竟走什么样的道路？这是运动中首先碰到的问题，也是能否多快好省地发展畜牧业的根本问题。争论的第一个焦点是大干、还是小干？是高速度发展、还是低速度发展或不发展？有一些山区的同志认为“山区地少地薄，粮食又少，只适宜于大量繁殖牛、羊，不适宜大量养猪。”有一些平原地区的同志又认为“山区饲料门路广、地少，达到一亩一头猪不算稀奇，平原区地多人少，光算劳力就办不到。”也有些经济作物区的同志认为“一般粮产区各种农作物的秸秆多，粮食也富裕，能够大发展，烟产区就不能大发展。”事实证明，这些唯条件论、悲观论，都是懒汉懦夫思想，是完全错误的。鲁山县山多山大，是全区山地面积最大的县份，但它却是七个山区县份中养猪最多的县。平原区的商水县张坡大队，是有名的“五湖十八坡”地区之一，经常遭受自然灾害的袭击，在一年零九个月的时间内，就达到每亩平均一点三头猪。长葛县是地少人多、经济作物多的县，但他们养猪却是产烟县份中最多的县，每户养猪已达一点七八头。由此可见，大量养猪，问题不在于客观条件如何，而在于领导是否有决心。
    集体喂养为主？还是社员分散喂养为主？事实证明，养猪事业确实同其他生产事业一样，组织起来就能发挥它的优越性，也能解决分散喂养时无法解决的种种困难。集体喂养，可以加强领导力量，组成专业队伍，培训专门技术人才，统一使用人力物力，能够多留母猪，实现高速度繁殖；能提高管理技术水平，避免疫病死亡；能大搞工具改革，实行半机械化或机械化，从而大大提高劳动生产效率。
    繁殖仔猪“多、快、好、活”
    高速度发展养猪事业，必须大抓母猪繁殖，做好以下几项工作才能做到“多、快、好、活”，即多留母猪，多生仔猪；快生，缩短孕期；推广优良品种，质量好；全生全活。
    大搞群众运动，开展大鸣大放大辩论，克服“阴天不配猪”、“每年只能生两窝”等迷信守旧思想，提高广大社员和管理人员的思想水平，是高速度繁殖仔猪的第一个关键。应教育干部、群众多留母猪，做到一不阉、二不杀、三不空怀。对种公猪，必须按一定比例（要求每二十五头母猪留一头）适时选足。同时，要大搞配种技术革新，提倡热配，推广双配、复配、人工授精等先进经验。热配以生后第二、三天交配为宜，最好是人工授精，如系自然交配应注意避风。热配后必须加强母猪饲养管理，产后喂温食；为不使母猪断奶，应适当喂些精饲料，并加喂钙质饲料，使二十天以内不断奶，并能促使母子健壮。对于未进行热配的母猪，大抓适时配种，建立档案制，推广老配早、小配晚、不老不小配中间等先进经验。
    养好仔猪必须过好两关：（1）出生关。仔猪出生时要求作到“三全、五防、四准备”。三全是母猪生产安全、小猪全活、全壮；五防是防止母猪流产，防止母猪吃衣胞或小猪（母猪应多喂钙质），防止小猪生后得脐带风，防止压死小猪，防止回奶（母猪产后二天内不要大喂，并加喂一些投奶饲料）；四准备是作好临产准备（禁用麦草垫窝），猪窝消毒准备（用艾子火），刀剪消毒准备，饲料准备等。（2）断奶关。首先应经常保持小猪清洁卫生，防止疾病；其次是小猪半月前后开始喂稀汤及其他饲料，使它练习早吃食，到二十天后逐渐断奶；其三是加强断奶后的专管专喂工作。
        因地制宜采集饲料
    只要根据靠山吃山、靠水吃水，就地取材、就地饲养的原则，各种类型地区都有条件把猪养好。在山区有取之不尽的野生植物，只要不含毒素都可当饲料。平原地区有大量的农作物秸、秆、叶、根、壳、芯，有各种树叶、杂草、水生植物等。经济作物区也具有平原区的特点。在饲料综合加工方面，商水县固墙人民公社“五里”养猪场，一年来已由单一的养猪场发展到“一场带六厂”，即：养猪场带粉厂、糖厂、油厂、化肥厂、酒厂、醋厂。养猪场收集各队的红薯辫、豆秆、芝麻秆经过加工利用后，除了获得农副产品外，并获得大量精饲料。另外，该场还开辟了一千一百一十七亩饲料基地，可收扁豆、南瓜、红萝卜、根达菜等六百多万斤。
            管好喂好
    根据各地经验，要搞好饲养管理工作，必须作到七好：
    第一、饲料加工处理好。饲料加工必须作到细、软、洁、熟，普遍推广用石灰、石膏大搞饲料碱化（一百斤饲料加十二两石灰或六两碱面）、钙化，使饲料发酵、发软、发酸、发甜。
    第二、饲料调配好。首先要作好品种调配，使猪吃花食，不吃单样草。其次要懂得植物性能，将凉性（柳叶、荆叶、秧秧菜等）、热性（榆叶、柴胡叶、乍草等）、平性（爬山虎、鬼柳叶等）饲料搭配开，热性的还可加喂石膏。其三，喂时酸、甜要加以调剂，并要大制五香料面，将花生皮、玉米芯、棉籽壳等用锅炒后粉碎，香气扑鼻，能增加猪的食欲。
    第三、季节掌握好。冬季喂温食，多喂热性饲料，少喂凉性饲料，多喂不稀不稠的食；夏季适当多喂凉性饲料，先喂稀后喂稠，多喂水，多洗澡；一年四季都应喂熟食。
    第四，执行“三要”好。三要是：一要定量（按头定量）。二要执行“三添三不喂”，即勤添、多添、吃完再添；饲料不加工好不喂、不清洁不喂、不到时间不喂。三要做好“五照顾”，即对病猪、残废猪、产前产后的母猪、小仔猪、胆小猪分别照顾。
    第五、分群分类管理好，即实行“六分群”、“四分类”的喂养办法。“六分群”是，把孕猪、产前一个月的猪、带猪娃的老母猪、仔猪、种猪、肉猪分为六群管理，每群再把大、小（包括弱的）、性格坏的、有病的分成四类，划圈喂养。
    第六、实行责任制度好。加强饲养管理必须建立严格的责任制，一般实行“三包五定一奖”。三包是包繁殖（包括怀胎率、繁殖率、成活率）、包增膘、包积肥；五定是：定头数（每人要求喂养八十至一百头）、定饲料、定圈舍、定工具、定工分；超额者奖励。
    第七、疫病预防好。搞好防疫工作，必须坚决贯彻以预防为主，以治疗为辅的方针。预防时必须建立严格的卫生防疫制度。治疗时又要以土法为主、土洋结合。要求饲养员要达到“四会”：会卫生防疫、会辨别病情、会用土法治病、会注射。除作好清洁卫生工作外，还要严格实行四检查两隔离。四检查是：每天要检查圈铺清洁，检查粪便，检查眼红，检查温度；两隔离是：病猪隔离，新入场的猪隔离考查。另外疫病流行时，要停止牧放。
          加强领导
    凡是哪里实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，哪里的养猪运动就迅速发展。因此各级党委第一书记要亲自动手，把养猪积肥摆到重要的议事日程上。
    建立专业养猪队伍是极为重要的环节。饲养员的条件必须是成份好，生产积极，不怕吃苦，思想进步，热爱养猪事业的社员。养猪场内的组织机构必须健全，一般应设党、团支部，场务委员会下设繁殖、饲养管理、饲料加工、防疫等四股。
