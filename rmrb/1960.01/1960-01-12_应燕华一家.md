    The Ying Yanhua Family
    By our reporters Ye Shitao and Xi Jinfen
    It was already six o'clock in the afternoon. We arrived at Caoyang New Village, Shanghai's largest workers' residential area, and after passing through many quiet streets, we found Ying Yanhua's home in a building in the Fourth Village.
    Ying Yanhua, this young housewife, was in the kitchen with her husband, who had just returned from work at the factory, taking care of the children's dinner. The couple warmly welcomed us into the bedroom. The room was not large, but it was clean and tidy; the furnishings were simple, but the layout was well-organized. On the bed covered with a large floral bedspread, the scarlet and emerald green quilts were neatly folded. The pictures on the wall and the flowers in the vase on the table complemented each other. Clearly, the owner is a capable housekeeper. Our visit this time was to hear how Ying Yanhua manages her household.
    This is a family of eight. Ying Yanhua's husband, Liu Baotong, is a worker in a printing factory. The four children, Yongsheng, Jianwen, Leping, and Zhimin, the eldest lives with his grandparents in Beijing, and the other three are in nearby kindergartens and nurseries during the day, and are brought home in the evening. Liu Baotong's monthly salary is 124 yuan, which is not very generous for supporting such a family, but the family lives comfortably and happily. They can set aside 18 yuan each month to participate in fixed savings deposits, not counting the current savings. How do they arrange their lives?
    Ying Yanhua happily talked to us about her family life. After receiving the monthly salary, the couple always discusses it. Firewood, rice, oil, salt, rent, children's nursery and childcare fees, these essential expenses amount to 60 yuan; then 20 yuan is sent to the family in Beijing, some pocket money is set aside, and the rest is saved. Their daily food expenses do not exceed five jiao (50 cents), and they eat a little worse on weekdays, but buy more on Sundays when Liu Baotong is off work. For clothing and supplies for adults and children, they buy what they need, save what they can, and postpone buying what is not urgently needed. At this point, Jianwen and the others came in, jumping and bouncing, after finishing their dinner. The topic naturally turned to the children. Ying Yanhua said that she often educates the children to be thrifty. Sometimes when they want to eat snacks, she explains some principles to them, telling them to save the money to make new clothes for the New Year. The three children in Shanghai now each have a fixed-term lottery savings account.
    We saw that the children's clothes were new and clean, and asked happily, "Did you buy them recently?" Ying Yanhua shook her head with a smile and replied that these were all made from old clothes. She casually turned over the floral cotton-padded jacket on Jianwen, and sure enough, the lining was pieced together. Ying Yanhua is very good at using her brain when it comes to clothes. She bought a sewing machine five years ago, and most of the clothes for the family are made by herself. She can also renew old items and make big things smaller, and when adult clothes are torn, she modifies them for the children to wear. Now, the small cotton-padded pants worn by Zhimin were made from her own old pants. Some clothes, sheets, and towels are so worn that they can no longer be used, so she uses them to make soles for shoes. Ying Yanhua said that disassembling, washing, sewing, and mending saves money for herself and cloth for the country, which is good for both the country and herself.
    In her daily life, Ying Yanhua is always careful and thrifty in everything. She uses coal ash to make coal balls, and rags to make mops; she can cook several different dishes with one kind of vegetable, which doesn't cost much and is very nutritious. Even the flowers in the vase are made by herself with crepe paper and wire that cost only two jiao (20 cents). Although water and electricity bills are shared equally by each household, Ying Yanhua also pays great attention to saving. Recently, because she has been busy with neighborhood work and stays up late at night, using the electric light for a little longer, she automatically replaced the 25-watt light bulb in the room with a 15-watt one. Liu Baotong is equally frugal, does not smoke, and does not drink alcohol. When the tables, chairs, and stoves at home are broken, he hammers and repairs them himself during his days off.
    However, they never skimp on money for buying books and newspapers. Over the years, they have always subscribed to the Liberation Daily. Ying Yanhua is also a long-time reader of "Branch Life" and "Chinese Women." Liu Baotong is studying in the factory's amateur middle school and has bought many political and mathematics books. The couple enjoys reading stories and novels about revolutionary martyrs, using the great spirit of the martyrs to encourage themselves and educate their children. Before liberation, Ying Yanhua knew very few characters, but now she can not only read books and newspapers, but also write her own lyrics.
    Ying Yanhua and her husband have planned their lives so well that they have saved a sum of money in the bank over the past few years. Talking about the benefits of savings, they both have deep feelings. One said that socialist construction needs funds, and participating in savings with surplus money allows the country to use it to build factories and make machines. When production develops, everyone's life will be better. The other said that saving is also beneficial to oneself. With savings, they can add some more decent things every year; they don't have to worry about spending during the New Year and holidays, or temporary emergencies. Ying Yanhua pointed to the new big bed and silk quilt and told us that as the number of children increased, the original furniture and bedding were not enough, and they took out 200 yuan from their savings in the past two years to buy these things. The family also uses their savings to make new clothes for the New Year and holidays. In 1958, Liu Baotong's mother suddenly suffered from high blood pressure and was hospitalized, so they took out some savings and sent it to her, which cured the old woman's illness. In the past, the cost of her childbirth was also covered by savings.
    Why are they able to live such a thrifty life? Liu Baotong and Ying Yanhua naturally talked about their past experiences. Although this young couple is only a little over thirty years old, they suffered a lot in the dark old society. Liu Baotong and Ying Yanhua, who had suffered enough in the old society, did not forget the pain after the wound healed. Although Liu Baotong has a fixed job in the factory since liberation, and his salary has been increased four times, with such an income each month, they are still diligent and thrifty, living a rich life as if it were a poor one. Liu Baotong is a communist party member, and he often talks about national affairs with Ying Yanhua at home to help her raise her awareness.
    Living a well-organized life has brought happiness to their family. The couple gets along very harmoniously and never quarrels. Liu Baotong is even more energetic in his production. The children are growing up white and chubby under the careful care of their mother. On holidays, the family often goes to the park to play, or goes to the cultural center of the new village to watch movies. We heard many praises about their family in Caoyang New Village. People call them a happy family.

    应燕华一家
    本报记者　叶世涛　奚锦芬
    已经是下午六点钟了。我们来到上海最大的工人住宅区曹杨新村，穿过许多清静的街道，在第四村的一幢楼房里找到了应燕华的家。
    应燕华，这个年轻的家庭妇女，正和刚从工厂下班回来的丈夫在厨房里照料孩子们吃晚饭。夫妇俩殷勤地把我们迎进了卧室。房间不算大，但是收拾得干干净净；陈设很简单，布置却井井有条。铺着大花被单的床上，整齐地叠着绯红、翠绿的被子。壁上的画片和桌上的瓶花相映成辉。显然，主人是一个持家的能手。我们这次访问，就是想听听应燕华是怎样管家的。
    这是一个八口之家。应燕华的丈夫刘宝同是一家印刷厂的工人。四个孩子永生、建文、乐平、志敏，大的在北京跟公公、婆婆住在一起，另外三个白天在附近的幼儿园、托儿所，晚上接回家来。刘宝同每月工资收入一百二十四元，负担这样的家庭不能算很宽裕，可是一家人过得挺舒服、挺愉快，每个月可以抽出十八元来参加定期储蓄，活期的还没有算在里面。他们是怎样安排生活的呢？
    应燕华很高兴地跟我们谈起了家常。每月拿到工资以后，夫妇俩总要合计一番。柴、米、油、盐，房租，孩子的托儿费和保育费，这些少不了的支出一共六十元；再拿出二十元寄给北京的家里，留下一些零用钱，其余的都参加储蓄。他们每天的菜金不超过五角钱，平时吃得差一些，逢到星期天刘宝同休息的日子就多买一些。大人、孩子的衣著用品，该买的买，能省的省，不急需的就暂时不买。谈到这里，建文他们吃完晚饭跳跳蹦蹦地进来了。话题自然地转到了孩子身上。应燕华说，她自己经常教育孩子们要节约，有时他们想吃零食，就讲一些道理，告诉他们把钱积起来过年时候做新衣裳穿。在上海的三个孩子现在每人都有一份定期有奖储蓄。
    我们看到孩子们的衣服又新又整洁，高兴地问，是最近买的吧？应燕华笑着摇摇头回答说，这些都是自己用旧衣服改的。她顺便翻开建文身上的花布小棉袄，果然夹里是拼接的。应燕华很会在衣服上动脑筋。五年以前她买了一架缝纫机，家里大小衣服大多由自己来做。她还会旧翻新、大改小，大人的衣服破了，改一改给孩子们穿。现在志敏穿的小棉裤，就是她自己的一条旧裤子改的。有些衣服、被单、毛巾实在破得不能再用，她就拿来纳鞋底。应燕华说，拆拆洗洗，缝缝补补，自己省钱，国家省布，对国家对自己都有好处。
    在日常生活里，应燕华总是精打细算，处处节约。她用煤屑做煤球，用破布扎拖把；用一种蔬菜能煮出几种味道不同的菜肴，花钱不多，营养很好。就连瓶里的插花，也是只花两角钱买些绉纸和铅丝自己做的。水费、电费尽管各家平均分担，应燕华也非常注意节省。最近她因为里弄工作比较忙，晚上睡得迟，电灯用得久一点，自动把房间里那只二十五支光的灯泡换成了十五支的。刘宝同同样节俭，不抽烟，也不喝酒。家里桌子、椅子、煤炉坏了，在休息日子就敲敲打打自己修理。
    可是，他们对买书买报的钱是从来不吝惜的。这些年来，他们一直订着解放日报。应燕华又是“支部生活”、“中国妇女”的老读者。刘宝同在厂里的业余中学学习，买了不少政治和数学的书籍。夫妇俩很喜欢阅读有关革命烈士的故事、小说，用烈士们的伟大精神勉励自己，教育孩子。解放前应燕华识字很少，现在不但能看书看报，而且会自己编歌词。
    应燕华夫妇这样有计划地安排生活，这几年来已经在银行里存有一笔钱了。谈到储蓄的好处，他们都深有体会。一个说，社会主义建设需要资金，拿余钱参加储蓄，国家可以用它盖工厂、造机器，生产发展了，大家的生活也就更好了。另一个说，储蓄对自己的益处也不小。有了存款，每年可以添一些比较成器的东西；过年过节、临时急用也不发愁。应燕华指指新的大床、绸被子告诉我们，孩子多了，原来的家具、被褥不够用，这两年从存款里取出二百元买了这些东西。一家人过年过节做些新衣服，也是用的存款。1958年刘宝同的母亲突然患高血压进了医院，他们便拿出一些存款寄去，治好了老人家的病。过去她生孩子的费用也靠了储蓄。
    他们为什么能这样俭朴过日子呢？刘宝同和应燕华自然地谈到了过去的遭遇。这一对年轻夫妇虽然年龄才三十多一点，在黑暗的旧社会里却受尽了磨难。在旧社会里受够了苦的刘宝同和应燕华，并没有好了疮疤忘了疼，尽管解放以后刘宝同在工厂里有了固定的工作，而且加了四次工资，每个月有这样一些收入，但是他们还是勤俭节约，把富日子当穷日子过。刘宝同是个共产党员，他在家里常常和应燕华谈谈国家大事，帮助她提高觉悟。
    生活安排得好，给他们一家带来了快乐。夫妇俩相处得很和睦，从来不吵嘴，刘宝同的生产更加有劲了。孩子们在妈妈的细心照顾下，个个长得又白又胖。假日里，一家人常常到公园里游玩，或者去新村的文化馆看电影。我们在曹杨新村听到了不少关于他们一家的赞语。人们称他们为幸福的家庭。
