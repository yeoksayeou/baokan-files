The Great Victory of the "Three Magic Weapons"
    Yang Bo

    In 1959, China's national economy, building on the great leap forward of 1958, continued to achieve an even better and more comprehensive great leap forward. The solemn task put forward by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party – to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule – has been victoriously achieved. This is a new and great victory for the "three magic weapons" of the general line for socialist construction, the development speed of the Great Leap Forward, and the organizational form of the People's Commune.

    A prominent feature of China's national economic development in 1959 was that it was both high-speed and proportionate, a high degree of unity between the two. First, let's look at the relationship between industry and agriculture. During the First Five-Year Plan, China's industry grew at an average annual rate of 18%, and agriculture grew at an average annual rate of 4.5%, with a ratio of industrial growth to agricultural growth of 4 to 1. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, industry grew by 66.2% and agriculture grew by 25%, narrowing the ratio of growth rates between the two to 2.65 to 1. The situation of agricultural development lagging behind industrial development began to change significantly. In 1959, while industry continued its great leap forward, agriculture continued to improve. In that year, industry grew by 39.3% and agriculture grew by 16.7%, further narrowing the ratio of growth rates between the two to 2.35 to 1, making the relationship between agriculture and industry more adapted and coordinated than in the past. Second, look at the relationship between heavy industry and light industry. In 1958, heavy industry grew by 103% and light industry grew by 33.7%, both unprecedented growth rates; the ratio of heavy industry growth to light industry growth was 3.06 to 1. In 1959, while continuing to maintain the priority growth of heavy industry, the growth rate of light industry also increased relatively faster. In that year, heavy industry grew by 43.3% and light industry grew by 34%, narrowing the ratio of growth rates between the two to 1.27 to 1, making the relationship between light industry and heavy industry more adapted and coordinated. The more adapted and coordinated proportional relationships between heavy industry, agriculture, and light industry indicate that the basic proportional relationship between the production of means of production and the production of consumer goods in social reproduction is more adapted and coordinated than in the past.

    This clearly shows that 1959 was an even better and more comprehensive great leap forward in China's national economy. How did this even better and more comprehensive great leap forward come about?

    First, this is a victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies.

    The basic proportional relationship in the national economy as expounded by Marxist reproduction theory is the proportional relationship between the production of means of production and the production of consumer goods. Specifically, it is the ratio between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, because heavy industry mainly produces means of productions, and agriculture and light industry produce consumer goods. Therefore, earnestly implementing the Party's policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, and developing heavy industry and light industry simultaneously, under the premise of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, has also arranged the basic proportional relationships in the national economy well, and can ensure that the development of the national economy is both high-speed and proportionate. This has been fully demonstrated by the practice of 1958 and 1959.

    The practice of the past two years has also proven that to carry out socialist construction at a high speed, it is necessary to implement the Party's mass line, that is, to launch mass movements on a large scale. The policy stipulated by the general line that the central and local authorities should be carried out simultaneously, large, medium, and small scales should be carried out simultaneously, and foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production should be carried out simultaneously, is the concrete application of the Party's mass line. In our large country with a population of more than 650 million, to accelerate the construction of socialism, it is not possible to rely solely on the strength of the central departments without fully leveraging the enthusiasm of various localities; it is also not possible to only run large-scale enterprises and large-scale projects without running medium and small-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale projects; it is also not possible to only focus on foreign methods of production without paying attention to the combination of foreign and indigenous methods and indigenous methods of production. To illustrate this point, we list the following data: In 1959, the total output value of local industry increased by 39.7%, faster than the growth rate of the total output value of central industry; the pig iron produced by medium and small-sized enterprises accounted for more than half of the country's total output of pig iron (excluding native iron), reaching 11.05 million tons, which was 1.52 million tons more than the total pig iron produced by all foreign methods in 1958; the volume of freight transported by folk transport tools reached 1.2 billion tons, accounting for more than half of the country's total freight volume, and their growth rate was 74%, faster than the growth rate of freight transported by modern transport tools. Obviously, it is not possible to walk on only one leg; only by walking on two legs can China's socialist construction事业 be developed at a high speed.

    Second, this is a victory for putting politics in command. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us that: Ideology and politics are the commander, are the soul. As long as our ideological and political work is slightly relaxed, economic and technical work will surely go astray. The practice of 1959 once again proved that this is an irrefutable truth. Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to oppose right-leaning and encourage hard work, production rose in a straight line. Taking steel production as an example: August increased by 13.5% compared with July, September increased by 20% compared with August, October increased by 19.9% compared with September, and November and December continued to increase. The objective material conditions did not change much, but only because we further adhered to putting politics in command, and people's thinking continued to move forward, did such significant results occur. It can be seen that adhering to putting politics in command is the fundamental guarantee for accelerating China's socialist construction.

    Finally, this is a victory for the People's Commune system. The practice of 1959 once again proved that the People's Commune is the best organizational form to promote the continued development of China's social productive forces and accelerate socialist construction. In 1959, China encountered severe natural disasters that had not been seen in decades, with disaster areas reaching 650 million mu, accounting for 30% of the total sown area. However, because the People's Commune brought into play its huge superiority of large scale and high degree of collectivization, organizing the vast number of commune members to carry out heroic struggles, it finally overcame the disasters and achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. In 1959, the total agricultural output value of the country increased by 16.7%, equivalent to 3.7 times the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period; the afforestation area reached 280 million mu, equivalent to 1.3 times the total afforestation area during the First Five-Year Plan period; the output value of sideline production increased by more than doubled, exceeding the growth rate of any previous year. At the same time, the industry of the People's Commune has been further consolidated and developed, with a total output value increasing by 70% compared with 1958.

    All this clearly shows that without the People's Commune, there would be no great development of various economic undertakings in the countryside in 1959, and there would be no comprehensive great leap forward in the national economy.

    “三个法宝”的伟大胜利
    杨波
    1959年我国国民经济，在1958年大跃进的基础上，继续获得了更好的全面的大跃进。党的八届八中全会提出的庄严任务——提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，已经胜利地实现了。这是社会主义建设的总路线、大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式“三个法宝”的新的伟大胜利。
    1959年我国国民经济发展的一个显著特点：既是高速度的，又是按比例的，是二者高度的统一。首先，看工业和农业的关系。第一个五年计划期间，我国工业平均每年增长18％，农业平均每年增长4．5％，工业增长速度与农业增长速度的比例为4比1。在1958年的大跃进中，工业增长66．2％，农业增长25％，两者的增长速度的比例缩小为2．65比1。农业发展落后于工业发展的状况开始有了显著改变。而在1959年中，在工业大跃进的同时，农业继续有所提高，这一年，工业增长39．3％，农业增长16．7％，两者的增长速度的比例进一步缩小到2．35比1，农业与工业的关系比过去更加适应了、协调了。其次，看重工业和轻工业的关系。1958年，重工业增长103％，轻工业增长33．7％，都是前所未有的增长速度；重工业增长速度与轻工业增长速度的比例为3．06比1。1959年，在继续保持重工业优先增长的同时，轻工业的增长速度也相对地提高得更快一些。这一年，重工业增长43．3％，轻工业增长34％，两者的增长速度的比例缩小为1．27比1，轻工业和重工业的关系更加适应了、协调了。重工业、农业和轻工业之间的比例关系的更加适应、协调，说明社会再生产中生产资料生产和消费资料生产这一基本比例关系，比过去更加适应了、协调了。
    这就清楚地表明：1959年是我国国民经济更好的全面大跃进。这样更好的全面大跃进是如何出现的呢？
    首先，这是党的社会主义建设总路线以及一整套“两条腿走路”方针的胜利。
    马克思主义再生产原理所阐述的国民经济中的基本比例关系，是生产资料生产和消费资料生产的比例关系。具体地说，就是工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的比例关系，因为重工业主要是生产生产资料的，农业和轻工业是生产消费资料的。因之，认真贯彻执行党的在优先发展重工业的条件下，发展工业和发展农业同时并举，发展重工业和发展轻工业同时并举的方针，也就把国民经济中的基本比例关系安排好了，就可以保证国民经济的发展既是高速度的，又是按比例的。这已经为1958年和1959年的实践所充分证明。
    两年来的实践也同样证明，要高速度地进行社会主义建设，就必须贯彻党的群众路线，也就是大搞群众运动，总路线规定的必须贯彻执行中央和地方并举、大中小并举、洋法生产和土法生产并举的方针就是党的群众路线的具体运用。在我们这样一个拥有六亿五千多万人口的大国里，要加速建设社会主义，只依靠中央各部门的力量，不充分发挥各地方的积极性，是不行的；只举办大型企业、大型工程，不举办中小型企业、中小型工程，也是不行的；只重视洋法生产，不重视洋土结合和土法生产，同样也是不行的。为了说明这个问题，我们列举下面几个资料：1959年，地方工业的总产值增长39．7％，快于中央工业的总产值的增长速度；中小型企业生产的生铁占全国生铁（不包括土铁）总产量的二分之一以上，达一千一百零五万吨，这比1958年全部洋法生产的生铁还多出一百五十二万吨；民间运输工具的货物运输量达到十二亿吨，占全国货物运输总量的一半以上，它们的增长速度是74％，快于现代化运输工具货物运输量的增长速度。很明显，只靠一条腿走路是不行的，只有两条腿走路，才能高速度地发展我国的社会主义建设事业。
    其次，这是政治挂帅的胜利。毛泽东同志指示我们说：思想和政治是统帅，是灵魂。只要我们的思想工作和政治工作稍微一放松，经济工作和技术工作就一定会走到邪路上去。1959年的实践，再一次证明了这是一条颠扑不破的真理。特别是在党的八届八中全会发出反右倾、鼓干劲的伟大号召以后，生产更是直线上升。以钢产量为例：8月比7月增长13．5％，9月比8月增长20％，10月比9月增长19．9％，11月、12月又继续增长。客观的物质条件并没有多少变化，只是由于进一步坚持了政治挂帅，人们的思想继续前进了，就产生了这样显著的效果。可见，坚持政治挂帅，是加速我国社会主义建设的根本保证。
    最后，这是人民公社制度的胜利。1959年的实践，再一次证明：人民公社是推动我国社会生产力继续向前发展，加速社会主义建设的最好的组织形式。1959年我国遇到了几十年来没有过的严重自然灾害，全国受灾面积达六点五亿亩，占全部播种面积的30％。但是，由于人民公社发挥了它的规模大和集体化程度高的巨大优越性，组织广大社员进行英勇斗争，终于战胜灾害，获得了农、林、牧、副、渔五业全面大丰收。1959年，全国农业总产值增长16．7％，相当于第一个五年计划期间平均每年增长速度的三点七倍；造林面积达二点八亿亩，相当于第一个五年计划期间造林面积总和的一点三倍；副业产值增长一倍多，超过了以往任何一年的增长速度。与此同时，人民公社的工业，获得了进一步的巩固和发展，总产值比1958年增长70％。
    这一切清楚地表明：没有人民公社，就不可能有1959年农村各项经济事业的大发展，就不可能有全国国民经济的全面大跃进。
