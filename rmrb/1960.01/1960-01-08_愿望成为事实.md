　　Wishes Come True

　　For many years, the people of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region had longed for their own institutions of higher learning. During the Great Leap Forward of 1958, their wish came true. This great achievement of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region people in the field of education, realized with revolutionary spirit, also reflects the profound changes taking place in minority areas.

　　Of course, for the people of Ningxia, it was by no means an easy task to start from scratch and establish three institutions of higher learning. But the important thing is that they adhered to the principle of putting politics in command. The Party organization promptly educated all teachers and students to recognize the situation and correctly deal with the difficulties in establishing the schools, so that the teachers and students were full of vigor and confidence, and deeply believed that the new schools could definitely be run well. They realized that the growth of any new thing must go through a difficult and tortuous process, and great efforts must be made to succeed. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party and with the concern and support of fraternal institutions in various places, they worked hard to overcome the difficulties in running the schools, conscientiously implemented the Party's education policy, and rapidly grew up to become a new base for cultivating advanced construction talents of all ethnic groups.

    愿望成为事实
    多少年来，宁夏回族自治区的人民就盼望着能有自己的高等学校。在大跃进的1958年，他们的愿望实现了。宁夏回族自治区人民用革命的精神在教育事业上所取得的这个巨大成就，也正反映了少数民族地区发生的深刻变化。
    当然，对于宁夏人民来说，白手起家创立三座高等学校，也决不是一件容易的事。但重要的是，他们坚持了政治挂帅，党组织及时教育了全体师生认清形势和正确地对待建校中的困难，使师生鼓足干劲，充满信心，深信新建学校是一定能够办好的。他们认识到任何新生事物的成长都要经过艰难曲折的过程，必须付出很大的努力才能成功。因此他们在党的领导和各地兄弟院校的关怀支援下，努力克服了办学中的困难，认真贯彻了党的教育方针，迅速地成长起来，成为培养各民族高级建设人材的一个新基地。
