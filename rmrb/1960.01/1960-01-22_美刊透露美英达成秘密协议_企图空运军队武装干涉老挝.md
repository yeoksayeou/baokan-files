Xinhua News Agency, 19th (Washington dispatch): According to the latest issue of "U.S. News & World Report," the United States and Britain have reached a secret agreement on armed intervention in Laos. The report reveals that they will airlift troops to Laos under the pretext of "if the Communists attempt to launch a new military aggression in Laos."

The magazine said in an article that its regional editor stationed overseas reported on January 15 that he obtained this information "from an absolutely reliable person—whose name cannot be revealed at this time—".

The magazine said that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Graham Parsons, had just concluded secret emergency meetings with top British and French government officials in London and Paris to coordinate actions in Laos. France is participating in comprehensive planning work.

The report stated, "Detailed plans are currently being actively drawn up in the Pentagon in Washington and the Ministry of Defence in London so that, if needed, the Anglo-American 'police force' can enter Laos at a moment's notice. The British are consulting with Australia and New Zealand on possible 'Commonwealth contributions.'"

The report said, "Since most of the French army is tied down in Algeria, it is believed that they will suggest participating with the air force, and possibly the navy."

The report also revealed that the secret agreement between the United States and Britain not only distorts the facts of the situation in Laos, but also contains extremely sinister intentions. The report said, "If needed, while sending troops to Laos, the United States and Britain will strengthen their military forces to prevent the Chinese Communists from openly attacking Laos. The United States and Britain have agreed to counter direct aggression by China in support of Communist guerrillas in Laos by attacking the Chinese mainland." The Anglo-American interventionists also openly threatened the Chinese people with atomic war. The report said, "The possibility of using nuclear weapons in such an action is not ruled out."

United Press International reported on the 18th, quoting a U.S. official in Washington who confirmed this conspiracy. The U.S. official said that it was almost certain that the United States and Britain would send troops to Laos "if Laos is subjected to large-scale Communist aggression." The official emphasized that any military action taken by the United States and Britain would be part of a joint intervention by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    美刊透露美英达成秘密协议
    企图空运军队武装干涉老挝
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：据最近一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”透露，美国和英国已经就武装干涉老挝达成一项秘密协议。消息透露，它们将在“如果共产党人企图在老挝发动新的军事侵略”的借口下，把军队空运到老挝去。
    这家杂志在一篇文章中说，它驻海外的一位地区编辑1月15日报道，他是“从一位绝对可靠的人士处——目前还不能透露他的名字——”获得这一情报的。
    这家杂志说，美国远东问题助理国务卿格雷姆·帕森斯刚刚在伦敦和巴黎同英、法政府最高级官员结束秘密的紧急会议，以便在老挝配合行动。法国正参加全面的计划工作。
    消息说，“目前在华盛顿五角大楼和伦敦的国防部正在积极地制订详细的计划，这样，如果需要的话，美英的‘警察部队’一接到通知就可以开入老挝。英国人在同澳大利亚和新西兰就可能的‘英联邦贡献’进行磋商。”
    消息说：“由于法国陆军大部分被牵制在阿尔及利亚，据信，他们将建议以空军，并且可能以海军参加。”
    消息还透露，美国和英国的秘密协议中不仅歪曲老挝局势的事实真象，而且还包含着极其阴险的目的。消息说，“如果需要的话，英美在派军队到老挝去的同时将加强军事力量，以便使中国共产党人不敢公开进攻老挝。美国和英国同意，将用袭击中国大陆的办法来对付中国为了支持在老挝的共产党游击队而进行的直接侵略。”美英干涉者还公然对中国人民进行原子战争恫吓，消息说，“没有排斥在这样一种行动中使用核武器的可能性。”
    合众国际社18日援引华盛顿一个美国官员的话证实了这个阴谋。这位美国官员说，美国和英国派兵到老挝几乎是肯定的，“如果老挝受到大规模的共产党侵略的话”。这个官员强调说，美英采取的任何军事行动将是东南亚条约组织联合干预的一部分。
