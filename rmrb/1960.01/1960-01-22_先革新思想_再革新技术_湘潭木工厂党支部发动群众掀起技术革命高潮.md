First Revolutionize Thinking, Then Revolutionize Technology
Xiangtan Wood Factory Party Branch Mobilizes the Masses to Launch a High Tide of Technical Revolution

(Our newspaper reporter Liu Yaoli reports) The Xiangtan City Wood Factory Party Branch in Hunan Province, in vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, adheres to putting politics in command and gives full play to the exemplary role of Party members. This has enabled the factory to get rid of heavy manual labor in a short period of just over a year. Among the factory's thirteen production processes, twelve have achieved mechanization or semi-mechanization. Last year, the factory exceeded the state's various production targets every month. The factory was praised by the provincial and municipal Party committees, and the factory's Party branch was also rated as a red flag branch in Xiangtan City and praised by the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The Xiangtan Wood Factory has 404 employees and eight workshops. It is a comprehensive wood factory that produces more than 200 products, including agricultural tools, factory equipment, and daily-use furniture. Of the factory's 36 Party members, 25 serve as production team leaders, workshop directors, and other positions. A year ago, the factory accepted the task of manufacturing 21,000 rice threshing machines, requiring completion within 70 days. This was a very arduous task for the newly established factory, which had only 208 employees at the time. If production were to continue using backward planes, axes, and saws, it would take at least five months to complete. In order to vigorously support agricultural production, the Party branch bravely accepted this task and proposed a struggle target of vigorously carrying out technical innovation and achieving mechanized and semi-mechanized operations in order to complete this task ahead of schedule and exceed the target. After this goal was put forward, it was actively supported by all Party members and most workers, but the understanding of some workers was still inconsistent. In light of this situation, the Party branch conducted a discussion throughout the factory, making everyone realize that in order to get rid of heavy manual labor, it is necessary to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution; in order to complete and exceed the arduous production tasks, it is necessary to vigorously carry out tool reform. All Party members made guarantees to the branch, each taking the lead in carrying out two innovations. Party member Ma Maiqiu first made a model of a three-in-one machine for cutting, tenoning, and shaping. After the Party branch secretary and deputy secretary helped him conduct specific research, draw up blueprints, and conduct trial production. During the trial production process, the tenoning slide was made of iron and required machining, but the factory did not have such equipment. All Party members carried the heavy iron slide by hand, taking turns grinding it on a grinding wheel, and finally succeeded in the trial production. In this way, the above three processes were changed from manual operation to mechanical operation, increasing work efficiency five times. Since then, rationalization proposals for reforming tools have sprung up like mushrooms throughout the factory.

After a heated campaign of technical innovation and technical revolution, by the end of 1958, the factory had invented, created, and imitated a total of eight types and thirteen pieces of machinery, combining indigenous and foreign methods, as well as some small tools, enabling nine of the factory's thirteen processes to achieve mechanized and semi-mechanized operation. However, between February and March of last year, it was discovered that workers were no longer using three types and five pieces of machinery combining indigenous methods, whether indigenous or foreign, and some small tools. What was the reason for this? The Party branch promptly convened a meeting of Party members to study the matter, and found that there were ideological problems as well as specific problems. For example, some workers had lower work efficiency due to being unfamiliar with the technology; some tools were not easy to use because the manufacturing quality was not good enough; and some were due to the failure to do a good job of protective equipment and formulate safe operating procedures, resulting in injuries to workers' fingers. In addition, the birth of a new tool is not perfect and needs further improvement, but people did not have enough understanding of it, and when they encountered difficulties, they passively stopped. In light of this situation, the branch decided that all Party members should go deep into the masses and rely on the masses to specifically solve the above problems. Party member Zhu Yunquan worked and studied with the workers on the surface planer, and learned that two or three workers had been injured on their fingers because there was no protective cover, and everyone was afraid to use it. Therefore, he immediately made a protective cover with the workers and formulated safe operating procedures. Some workers were not using the electric saw, but were sawing wood by hand, one saw at a time. Party member Tan Dexun discovered that the reason for this situation was that the workers were not proficient in the operating methods and the work efficiency was not high. He then gave a live demonstration and patiently helped the workers master the operating techniques, resulting in a great increase in work efficiency. After more than a month of work, workers were happy to use the eight types, thirteen pieces, and some small tools made in the past, further promoting the widespread and in-depth development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. And seven new types and eleven pieces of machinery were newly made.

After the factory's technical innovation achieved great results, some people developed a mentality of complacency. After discovering this situation, the Party branch promptly organized all factory employees to carry out a discussion on whether technical innovation and technical revolution had reached their peak. Through the discussion, everyone realized that not only had they not reached their peak, but they had only just begun to take the first step. Then, under the leadership of the Party branch, Party member Ma Maiqiu and two other Party members and two members of the masses formed a "Key Innovation Breakthrough Group." This group made three tools, a line-drawing plane and an opener, just for the seat board of the folding chair, increasing work efficiency by four to eight times, further shattering the idea among the masses that "innovation has reached its peak." In this way, the factory's technical innovation and technical revolution surged again. In just over three months, as many as forty-seven types and eighty-two pieces of medium and small tools were created, invented, and imitated, increasing work efficiency by one to eight times.

Because the factory's Party branch fully played the exemplary leading role of Party members in technical innovation and technical revolution, and closely carried out tool reform with the masses, it saved 29,642 workdays in just over a year, which is equivalent to increasing the factory's labor force by 33.4%. Now the factory's production upsurge is rising wave after wave, continuing to move forward.

    先革新思想　再革新技术
    湘潭木工厂党支部发动群众掀起技术革命高潮
    本报讯　记者刘耀黎报道：湖南省湘潭市木工厂党支部，在大搞技术革新和技术革命中，坚持政治挂帅，充分发挥党员的模范带头作用，使这个厂在短短的一年多时间内，就摆脱了笨重的体力劳动。在全厂十三道生产工序中，有十二道实现了机械化半机械化，去年月月超额完成了国家各项生产指标。这个厂受到省、市委的表扬，厂的党支部也被评为湘潭市的红旗支部，受到中共湘潭地委的表扬。
    湘潭木工厂有四百零四名职工、八个车间，是个生产农具、工厂用具和日用家具等二百多种产品的综合性木工厂。全厂三十六个党员中，有二十五个担任生产小组长、车间主任等职务。一年以前，该厂接受了制造两万一千部打稻机的任务，要求七十天完工。这对当时只有二百零八名职工、才成立不久的新厂来说，是一个非常艰巨的任务。如果仍然用落后的刨子、斧头、锯子来生产，至少也要五个月才能完成。党支部为了大力支援农业生产，勇敢地接受了这一任务，并提出了大搞技术革新，实现机械化和半机械化操作，来提前超额完成这一任务的奋斗目标。这个目标提出后，受到了全体党员和大部分工人的积极拥护，但部分工人的认识还不一致。根据这种情况，党支部在全厂范围内进行了一次讨论，使大家认识了要摆脱笨重的体力劳动，就必须大搞技术革新和技术革命；要完成和超额完成艰巨的生产任务，就必须大搞工具改革。全体党员向支部提出保证，每人带头搞两项革新。党员马麦秋首先做出了齐头、刹榫、落尖三用机的模型，经过党支部书记和副书记帮助他进行了具体研究，绘出图纸，进行试制。在试制过程中，刹榫上的走条是铁的，要刨床加工，可是厂里没有这种设备，全体党员便用手抬着这笨重的铁制走条，轮班在砂轮上磨，终于试制成功了。这样，就把以上三道工序，由手工操作改为机械操作，提高了工效五倍。自此以后，全厂改革工具的合理化建议如雨后春笋，不断涌现。
    该厂经过热火朝天的大搞技术革新和技术革命后，到1958年年底，共发明创造和仿制了八种、十三台土洋结合的机具和一些小工具，使全厂的十三道工序中有九道实现了机械化和半机械化操作。可是，到去年2、3月间，又发现有三种、五台土的和土洋结合的机具和一些小工具，工人不再使用了。这到底是什么原因呢？党支部及时召开党员大会进行了研究，发现其中有思想问题，也有具体问题。比如有的工人由于技术不熟，工效比较低；有的工具因为制造时质量不够好，不好使用；有的则由于没搞好防护设备和制订安全操作规程，而碰伤了工人的手指。加以一件新工具的诞生不是十全十美，还需要进一步改进，而人们对它认识不足，一遇到困难，就消极地停下来。根据这一情况，支部决定：全体党员都深入下去，依靠群众具体解决上述问题。党员朱运泉在平刨机上和工人边劳动边研究，知道由于没有防护罩，碰伤了两、三个工人的手指，大家都不敢用了。于是，他马上和工人一起做防护罩，并制订出安全操作规程。有的工人放着电锯机不用，却在一锯一锯地用手工锯木头。党员谭德训发现造成这一情况的原因，是由于工人操作方法不熟练，工效不高。他便进行现场表演，耐心地帮助工人掌握操作技术，结果工效大大提高。经过一个多月的工作，过去做的八种、十三台和一些小工具，工人都乐意使用，进一步促进了技术革新和技术革命运动普遍深入的开展。并且又新制成了七种、十一台机具。
    这个厂的技术革新取得巨大成绩后，有些人产生了满足现状的思想。党支部发现这一情况后，便及时组织全厂职工开展了技术革新和技术革命是否到顶的讨论。通过讨论，使大家认识到不仅没有到顶，而且仅仅开始走第一步。接着，在党支部的领导下，党员马麦秋等三个党员和两个群众，又组成了“革新突破关键小组”，这个小组仅在活动折椅的坐板上，就做成了取线刨、开口器三件工具，提高工效四到八倍，进一步打破了群众中“革新到顶”的思想。这样，全厂的技术革新和技术革命又风起云涌，在短短的三个多月中，仅创造发明和仿制的中、小工具就达四十七种、八十二件，提高工效一至八倍。
    这个厂的党支部由于充分发挥党员在技术革新和技术革命中的模范带头作用，紧密和群众一起大搞工具改革，在短短的一年多一点的时间内，就节省了两万九千六百四十二个劳动日，等于给全厂增加了33．4％的劳动力。现在全厂的生产高潮，正一浪盖过一浪，继续向前推进。
