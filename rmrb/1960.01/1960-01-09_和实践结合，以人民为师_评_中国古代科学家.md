Combining Theory with Practice, Taking the People as Teachers
A Review of "Ancient Chinese Scientists"
Edited by the Chinese Natural Science History Research Office, Published by Science Press
Beijing University History Department, Ancient Chinese History Teaching and Research Section

	The book "Ancient Chinese Scientists" recounts the outstanding achievements of twenty-nine ancient Chinese scientists in science and technology. It was written by researchers and experts from various related units and edited by the Chinese Natural Science History Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This book convincingly demonstrates that throughout the entire historical period of Chinese feudal society, our achievements in science and technology were quite extraordinary.

	The Dujiangyan irrigation project, built by Li Bing and his son in the mid-3rd century BC, can still irrigate more than 5 million mu of fields in fifteen counties. The large stone arch bridge in Zhaozhou, Hebei, built by Li Chun in the early 7th century AD, is still in use. This form of the Zhaozhou Bridge appeared in Europe more than 900 years later than in China. As for the "Yingzao Fashi" written by Li Jie of the Song Dynasty, it is not only the best dictionary and manual for studying ancient Chinese architecture, but also a rare and extraordinary book in the world. These are all the glories radiated by ancient China in construction and water conservancy projects.

	Li Shizhen's materia medica is an outstanding work in medical science and even plant classification. Zhang Heng's seismograph, invented in 132 AD, was more than 1,700 years earlier than the seismographs created in Europe. Zu Chongzhi calculated the value of pi to be between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, with the precise ratio being 355/113 and the approximate ratio being 22/7. In Europe, this value was not obtained until Otto of Germany, a thousand years later than Zu Chongzhi. Su Song's water-powered astronomical clock in the Song Dynasty was the direct ancestor of European astronomical clocks. In 105 AD, Cai Lun improved papermaking using plant fibers. In the mid-8th century AD, Chinese papermaking technology spread to Central Asia; in the mid-12th century, it was introduced to Spain by the Arabs. Around the 10th century AD, Bi Sheng, a craftsman of the Song Dynasty, invented movable type printing, which was 400 years earlier than Gutenberg in Europe. The compass was also an important invention of our ancestors, and it was used in navigation during the Song Dynasty. At that time, Shen Kuo also discovered that the magnetic needle on the compass did not point directly south, but slightly east. These remarkable achievements are all milestones in the history of world science and technology, and are the glory of our ancient science and technology history, as well as the glory of the world's science and technology history.

	Bian Que's divine medicine, Zhang Zhongjing's Treatise on Febrile Diseases, Hua Tuo's surgery, Ge Hong's alchemy, Tao Hongjing and Sun Simiao's materia medica and prescriptions, Yi Xing, Guo Shoujing, and Xu Guangqi's astronomy, Ming Antu's rapid method of dividing the circle, Ma Jun's waterwheel and new-style jacquard loom, Pei Xiu's map drawing methods, Li Daoyuan and Xu Xiake's achievements in geography, Jia Sixie and Wang Zhen's compilation of agricultural science, and Shen Kuo and Song Yingxing's versatility also made outstanding contributions in ancient Chinese science history.

	Huang Daopo is the only female scientist in the book. She introduced the entire set of cotton textile technology possessed by the Li women of Hainan Island to her hometown - the women of Shanghai. Huang Daopo shows the important contributions of the Li people to the history of the motherland, and Ming Antu shows the wisdom of the Mongolian people in mathematics. This illustrates that our ethnic minorities have made contributions to the development of the motherland's culture.

	The occurrence and development of science are inseparable from production practice, and the history of ancient Chinese science and technology proves this point. Li Chun of the Sui Dynasty was able to build the Zhaozhou Stone Bridge thanks to the development of the iron and steel industry. Li Huidai built a large iron cauldron weighing two thousand jin for the Yuquan Temple in Dangyang County, Hubei, which is a concrete material illustrating the development of iron and steel technology around the 7th century AD. From the Jin to the Sui Dynasties, there were Pei Xiu, Ge Hong, Zu Chongzhi, Li Daoyuan, Jia Sixie, Tao Hongjing, and Li Chun. Taking Pei Xiu and Li Daoyuan as examples, they were both outstanding figures in the history of ancient Chinese geography. Their achievements were not accidental. The number of volumes of geography books collected in the Sui Shu Jing Ji Zhi Shi Bu far exceeded those of previous generations, which is a reflection of social and production development. The achievements and contributions of Li Shizhen, Xu Guangqi, Xu Xiake, and Song Yingxing in the 16th and 17th centuries in science also illustrate this principle. Song Yingxing's "Tiangong Kaiwu" is a complete record of the development of production technology at that time. The achievements of all these scientists reflect the development of production technology at that time, and also allow us to infer the social development at that time. The publication of "Ancient Chinese Scientists" is helpful for historical research.

	The history of ancient Chinese science and technology also shows that science and technology must take root among the masses, come from the masses, and return to the masses in order to have life. The lives of Lu Ban, Bian Que, Li Bing and his son, Cai Lun, Zhang Heng, Sun Simiao, Huang Daopo and others were all closely linked to the working people of their time. Therefore, in the hearts of the people in the past, they were born as human beings and died as gods. In addition, Li Chun and Bi Sheng, who were born as craftsmen, fully demonstrated the wisdom of the working people and made indelible contributions to the history of ancient Chinese science and technology.

	Many others were also able to achieve such achievements because they were inseparable from the power of the masses. For example, Jia Sixie, whose "Qimin Yaoshu" is a great work in ancient agricultural science, a large part of which came from his research with old farmers and his personal investigations. Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" is an epoch-making work in the history of Chinese science, but Li Shizhen was able to have laborers as his assistants and teachers, so he was able to achieve such great achievements. Wang Zhen, Xu Guangqi, and other scientists also achieved success in science by inheriting and developing the fine tradition of Chinese science and technology history - taking the people as teachers and drawing wisdom from the masses.

	In the past ten years since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have been carrying out unprecedented socialist revolution and socialist construction with heroic strides and soaring enthusiasm. Now, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the people of the whole country are engaging in science in a big way and carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution in a big way. The book "Ancient Chinese Scientists," with irrefutable historical facts, illustrates the achievements of our ancestors in science and technology, which is a new encouragement for us. At the same time, it also tells us that scientists can only achieve success under the leadership of the Party, by following the mass line, and by combining with production practice. In addition, because the authors of this book are researchers and experts from various related units, the book is generally rich in content and easy to understand. This writing method is also worth promoting.

	However, judging from the level we have reached today in the study of ancient Chinese history and ancient science and technology, the book "Ancient Chinese Scientists" could have been written better. Based on this situation, we would like to offer some suggestions on some of the shortcomings of this book.

	The summary of the book says, "No scientist can be separated from the era in which he lives, so the book provides a simple narrative of the historical background of each character." However, in the twenty-nine scientists described in this book, the historical background of many people is not described well enough, such as the two articles about Bi Sheng of the Northern Song Dynasty and Wang Zhen of the Yuan Dynasty. Measuring a scientist's contribution to history should be consistent with the estimate of the social and economic conditions of the historical period in which he lived. However, the authors of some articles in this book have not done well in this regard. For example, in the Xu Guangqi article, the author believes that at that time "it was a very significant stage in the budding of capitalism in our country," but at the same time regrettably said: "Although Xu Guangqi's 'Nongzheng Quanshu' is a valuable cultural heritage of our country, the way of thinking that runs through this book is in line with the requirements of some landlords at that time." Since the budding of capitalist relations of production in the late Ming Dynasty was indeed an objective fact, then what the author regrets about "Nongzheng Quanshu" is precisely the progressive aspect of Xu Guangqi's thought, because the landlords represent the advanced relations of production at that time.

	There are still many points in the book that can be discussed regarding the discussion of certain scientists and certain events. For example, our archaeological workers once unearthed a piece of relatively rough hemp paper at the site of the Western Han Dynasty beacon tower in Lop Nur, Xinjiang, which was determined to be from the 1st century BC at the latest; a piece of paper made of plant fiber and written with several lines of text was also unearthed at the site of a Han Dynasty beacon tower next to the Ejin River, which was determined to be from the 90s of the 1st century AD. However, the author of the Cai Lun article in this book "still believes that Cai Lun is the inventor of paper," which is inappropriate. The manufacture and invention of weapons and armaments is of great significance for preventing enemy invasions and defending the security of the country and the nation. However, the author of the Ma Jun article in this book believes that Ma Jun's improvement of the "repeating crossbow" and trial production of rotating stone throwing machines is "inevitably a stain on his glorious life, and fortunately his design was not applied and has not caused a major mistake." This is also inappropriate. Li Daoyuan's Shui Jing Zhu "records many legendary stories such as gods and immortals," which makes Shui Jing Zhu not only a geographical book with high scientific value, but also has certain characteristics in literature and art. Just to deeply understand the folk customs of a certain ancient area, stories and legends popular in a certain area are often a very effective way. However, the author of the Li Daoyuan article in this book only believes that this is because Li Daoyuan's "ideological consciousness still has a tinge of idealism," which seems one-sided. The author of the Xu Xiake article said that Xu Xiake was born in a "great era," so he became such a great person, and through this person, he showed the great "spirit of the era," which is an exaggerated statement that does not conform to historical reality. In this article, the author also attributed the discovery of the source of the Yangtze River and the source of the Nanpan River and the Beipan River to Xu Xiake, which is a continuation of the erroneous statement in Ding Wenjiang's "Xu Xiake Chronology".

	The summary of this book says that this book is to "strive for popular text." However, many articles do not meet this requirement, and some articles have grammatically incorrect and inaccurate texts. There are also problems with the illustrations in the book. For example, the portraits of Bian Que, Zhang Zhongjing, and Tao Hongjing have overly similar expressions and appearances, especially Tao Hongjing, who is holding a thread-bound book printed with woodblocks. Tao Hongjing was a figure from the 5th and 6th centuries, and at that time there were at least two hundred years before the invention of block printing, and even further away from the appearance of thread-bound books. In addition, there are some individual errors in the book. For example, "Baoqing County" in the seventh line of page 51 should be "Shaoyang County", and "Shoushan Pavilion Ming edition" in the fourteenth line of page 129 should be "Shoushan Pavilion edition" or "Shoushan Pavilion Series".

    和实践结合，以人民为师
    评“中国古代科学家”

    “中国古代科学家”一书，记述了二十九位我国古代科学家在科学和技术方面的卓越成就。它是由各有关单位的研究人员和专家撰写、中国科学院中国自然科学史研究室编辑而成的。这本书令人信服地说明了，在我国的整个封建社会历史时期之内，我们在科学技术方面的成就是很不平凡的。
    公元前三世纪中叶，李冰父子所修的都江堰水利工程，至今还能灌溉十五个县的五百多万亩田。公元后七世纪初年，李春所修河北赵州的大型石拱桥，至今还在使用。赵州桥这种形式，在欧洲出现比我们晚九百多年。至于宋代李诫所著的“营造法式”，不仅是研究我国古代建筑营造的一部最好的辞典和手册，也是全世界少见的一部奇书。这些都是我国古代在营造建筑和水利工程方面所放射的光辉。
    李时珍的本草学，是医药科学以至植物分类方面的杰出著作。张衡的侯风地动仪，发明于公元132年，比欧洲创造的地震仪要早一千七百多年。祖冲之算出的圆周率在3．1415926和3．1415927之间，密率或作355／113，约率为22／7。在欧洲，一直到德国的鄂图才得到了这一数值，比祖冲之晚了一千年。宋朝苏颂的水运仪象台，是欧洲天文钟的直接祖先。公元105年，蔡伦改良了用植物纤维造纸。公元八世纪中叶，中国造纸术传至中亚细亚；十二世纪中叶，始由阿拉伯人传至西班牙。公元十世纪左右，宋朝的工匠毕昇发明了活字版印刷术，比欧洲的谷腾堡要早四百年。指南针也是我们古代的一个重要发明，宋代已用于航海。当时，沈括并且发现了罗盘上的磁针不指正南，而略偏东。以上这些了不起的成就，都是世界科学技术史上的里程碑，是我们古代科学技术史上的光荣，也是世界科学技术史上的光荣。
    扁鹊的神医，张仲景的伤寒论，华佗的外科手术，葛洪的炼丹术，陶弘景和孙思邈的本草学和方药，一行、郭守敬、徐光启的天文学，明安图的割圆密率捷法，马钧的翻车和新式绫机，裴秀的地图画法，郦道元、徐霞客在地理学上的成就，贾思勰、王祯对于农业科学的整理，沈括、宋应星的多才多艺，在我国古代科学史上也有突出的贡献。
    黄道婆是书中唯一的女科学家。她把海南岛黎族妇女所有的一整套棉纺织技术，介绍给她的家乡——上海妇女。由黄道婆可以见到黎族对于祖国历史上的重要贡献，由明安图可以见到蒙古族在数学上的智慧。这都说明，我们的少数民族在祖国文化的发展上是作出了贡献的。
    科学的发生和发展是和生产实践分不开的，中国古代科学和技术的历史证明了这一点。隋代李春修造赵州石桥，得力于冶铁业的发展。李慧达建造施舍给湖北当阳县玉泉寺的大铁镬，计重两千斤，这是说明公元七世纪左右冶铁技术发展的具体材料。自晋至隋，有裴秀、葛洪、祖冲之、郦道元、贾思勰、陶弘景、李春诸人。仅就裴秀、郦道元来说，他们都是中国古代地理学史上的杰出人物。他们的成就不是偶然的。隋书经籍志史部地理类所收的卷数远远超过前代，这是社会和生产发展的一个反映。十六、十七世纪的李时珍、徐光启、徐霞客、宋应星诸人在科学方面的成就和贡献，也说明了这个道理。宋应星的“天工开物”就是一部当时生产技术发展的总纪录。所有这些科学家的成就，反映了当时的生产技术的发展，也使我们可以从此推知当时社会发展的情况。“中国古代科学家”一书的出版，有助于历史研究工作。
    中国古代科学和技术的历史，又说明了科学技术一定要在群众中扎根，从群众中来，又回到群众中去，然后才有生命。如鲁班、扁鹊、李冰父子、蔡伦、张衡、孙思邈、黄道婆诸人的一生，都和当时的劳动人民有血肉相联的关系，因此，他们在过去人民的心目中是生而为人、死而为神的。此外，出身于工匠者还有李春和毕昇，他们都充分发挥了劳动人民的智慧，在我国古代科学技术史上，立下了不可磨灭的功绩。
    其余许多人之所以能有那样的成就，和群众的力量也是分不开的。如贾思勰，他所写的“齐民要术”是古代农业科学上一部伟大著作，其中很大一部分就是他同老农研究和他亲自考察得来的。李时珍的“本草纲目”，是中国科学史上一部划时代的著作，但是，李时珍能以劳动者为他的助手和老师，所以他能有那样伟大的成就。王祯、徐光启和其他的科学家，他们在科学上有所成就，也都是继承和发扬了中国科学技术史上这一优良传统——以人民为师，从群众中汲取智慧。
    建国十年来，我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，以豪迈的步伐，冲天的干劲，进行史无前例的社会主义革命和社会主义建设工作。现在，全国人民正在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，大搞科学，大搞技术革新、技术革命。“中国古代科学家”一书，以无可辩驳的历史事实，说明我们的祖先在科学技术上的成就，对于我们是一个新的鼓舞。同时，它也告诉了我们，科学家只有在党的领导下，走群众路线，和生产实践相结合，才能有所成就。此外，由于这本书的作者都是各有关单位的研究人员和专家，所以一般而言这本书是内容丰富、深入浅出的。这种写作方法也很值得提倡。
    但是，就我们今天对于中国古代历史和古代科学技术的研究所已经达到的水平而论，“中国古代科学家”一书是有可能写得更好一些的。根据这一情况，我们愿就这本书中所存在的一些缺点提出几点意见。
    这本书的内容简介中说，“任何科学家都脱离不开他所生活的时代，所以书中对每个人物的时代背景都作了简单的叙述。”但是，在这本书所述写的二十九个科学家当中，有好些人的时代背景是叙述得很不够的，例如讲述北宋的毕升和元代的王祯的两篇即是如此。衡量一个科学家的成就对历史的贡献，应该和对他所处历史时期的社会经济情况的估计相一致。但是，这本书中某些篇的作者，在这一方面做得还不成功。例如，在徐光启篇中，作者认为当时“是我国资本主义萌芽十分显著的阶段”，同时却又遗憾地说：“徐光启的‘农政全书’虽然是我国一部宝贵的文化遗产，但贯穿这书内的思想方法又在在符合了当时某些经营地主们的要求。”既然在明末资本主义生产关系的萌芽确已是客观存在的事实，那么作者对“农政全书”所致憾的就正是徐光启思想中的进步的一面了，因为经营地主就是代表着当时先进的生产关系的。
    书中对某些科学家和某些事件的论述还有很多可以商榷的地方。例如，我国的考古工作者在新疆罗布淖尔西汉烽燧亭遗址里曾经掘得一张质地比较粗糙的麻纸，经考定至晚当为公元前一世纪内的遗物；在额济纳河旁的一个汉代烽燧亭遗址上也曾经掘得一张用植物纤维所做的并写有好几行文字的纸，经考定是公元后第一世纪九十年代内的遗物。然而本书蔡伦篇的作者“仍然相信蔡伦是纸的发明人”，这是不恰当的。武器兵器的制造和发明，对于防制敌人的侵袭和卫护国家民族的安全来说，是具有很大的意义的。然而本书马钧篇的作者对于马钧的改进“连弩”和试制轮转式的发石机，却以为是“在他光辉的一生当中，不免加了一个污点，所幸他的设计没有应用，还未铸成大错。”这也同样是不恰当的。郦道元的水经注中“记载了不少神仙异闻等传奇的故事”，这使得水经注不只是一部具有很高科学价值的地理书，而且在文学艺术方面也具有一定的特色。单就深入了解古代某地区的民情风俗等事来说，通过某地区流行的故事和传说，也常常是很有效的途径之一。然而本书郦道元篇的作者在估价这个特点时，却仅仅认为这是郦道元的“思想意识中还不免有唯心主义色彩”，似嫌片面。徐霞客篇的作者说，徐霞客生在“伟大的时代”，所以他成为这样一个伟大的人物，通过这一人物又表现了伟大的“时代精神”，这是和历史实际不相符合的夸大的论断。在这一篇中，作者还把长江江源和南盘江北盘江江源的发现归功于徐霞客，这是沿袭了丁文江的“徐霞客年谱”中的错误说法。
    这本书的内容简介中说，这本书是要做到“文字力求通俗”的。但是，有好些篇不甚符合这个要求，并且有些篇的文字还有不合语法、不够确切之处。书中的插图也有问题。例如，扁鹊、张仲景、陶弘景三人的画像，神情和面貌过于相似，特别是陶弘景又拿着一册木版印刷的线装书。陶弘景是第五、六世纪间的人物，那时距离雕板术的发明至少还有二百年，距离线装书的出现就更远了。此外，书中还有个别错误。例如，第五十一页七行括号里的“宝庆县”应作“邵阳县”，第一百二十九页十四行的“守山阁明刊本”应作“守山阁刊本”或“守山阁丛书本”。
