Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: On the occasion of the Spring Festival, the traditional Support-the-Army and Give-Preference-to-Families activities have been widely unfolded throughout the country.

All provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have organized Spring Festival Comfort Groups from all sectors of the people to express sympathy to the local People's Liberation Army troops, the People's Armed Police performing border defense tasks, the wounded and sick, families of martyrs, families of soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, etc., conveying the care and expectations of the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people of the motherland to them. The Spring Festival Comfort Groups from all sectors of the people in the coastal defense frontlines of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, along with dozens of theatrical troupes and film projection teams accompanying the comfort, will go to the frontline army, navy, and air force troops and the troops stationed on the islands to celebrate the Spring Festival with commanders and fighters. The Spring Festival Comfort Group from all sectors of the people in Shanghai visited the wounded and sick of the People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police in various hospitals on the 23rd. Many leading actors of professional theatrical troupes accompanied the comfort group to perform wonderful programs for the wounded and sick in the wards.

Tens of thousands of letters of comfort are being sent to all units of the People's Liberation Army, thanking the commanders and fighters for their meritorious service in defending the peaceful labor of the people of the motherland. People from all over the country expressed in their letters of comfort that they would learn from the noble qualities of the Liberation Army of being infinitely loyal to the Party and the people, and the revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardships and difficulties, and make better achievements in different posts this year. Families of martyrs and revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, as well as workers, peasants, students, and residents in Shandong Province have recently launched a "Letter Movement," writing letters to relatives or comrades-in-arms in the troops, reporting on the production, living conditions, and construction achievements of their hometowns.

Various activities are also being held in various places to publicize the achievements of the People's Liberation Army in defending the security of the motherland and supporting national construction, and to reward the exemplary deeds of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers in the Great Leap Forward. Thirteen cities and counties in Fujian Province, including Fuzhou, Putian, Fu'an, and Tongan, held rallies of activists among families of martyrs, families of soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, commending a large number of activists. Many factories and mines in Shenyang City held reward and competition meetings for demobilized, transferred, and retired soldiers. At the competition meeting held in Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, 254 activists were rewarded. Tiexi District of Shenyang City has already held eight report meetings and dispatched propaganda trucks to publicize to the people the contributions of the Liberation Army and families of martyrs, families of soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers in the construction of socialist cause. Many agencies and schools in Chongqing held report meetings and forums, inviting leaders of the garrison troops or veteran Red Army soldiers, outstanding demobilized soldiers to give reports. Some units also held exhibitions introducing the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army.

Caring for the lives of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers is one of the important contents of this Support-the-Army and Give-Preference-to-Families activities. Many regions are conducting inspections of preferential treatment work, soliciting opinions from families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, and helping them solve certain difficulties in their lives to ensure that their living standards are not lower than the average level of commune members. In order to enable families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers to celebrate the Spring Festival happily, many shops and theaters have made preferential arrangements. Young people, women, and children in various places have also widely launched activities to "do a good deed for families of martyrs and soldiers," helping them with firewood, laundry, cleaning, etc. Residents of Foshan City, Guangdong Province, are generally helping families of martyrs and soldiers with cleaning, saying that they want to make all "Families of Glory" become "Families of Hygiene." In Beidaihe District, Hebei Province, more than 5,000 students, cadres, and people turned out to clean houses for families of martyrs and soldiers, and organized 20 medical personnel to conduct physical examinations for families of martyrs and soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers. Dajing Road Primary School in Changchun City, which is famous for its good preferential treatment work, has taken over all the chores of fetching water, transporting coal, buying grain, and cleaning houses for nearby families of martyrs and soldiers during the Spring Festival.
