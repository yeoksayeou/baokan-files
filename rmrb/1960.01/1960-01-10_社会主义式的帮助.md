    Socialist Assistance
    German Democratic Republic 　　Hè Hǎidé Lìxī (赫·海德利希)
    
    The Exemplary Deeds of Textile Worker Leicht
    Until the end of July 1959, thirty-six-year-old textile worker Irmgard Leicht worked at the Third Factory of the Zittau State-Owned Textile Combine in the German Democratic Republic. She was an expert in her field, able to complete her plans on time, resulting in a good income. Her work team was a conscious collective, consistently leading the entire factory. However, Leicht was not satisfied. While the Third Factory regularly completed its plans, the First and Sixth Factories lagged behind, and these two branches were primarily responsible for the Zittau Textile Combine's failure to produce 800,000 meters of textile.

    Leicht had been a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany since 1946, and the Party had educated her to be politically conscious, capable of independent thought and action. She knew that the First and Sixth Factories' failure to complete their plans would bring losses to everyone, delaying and hindering common progress, i.e., the victory of socialism. She thought about it for a long time. When she heard about the great deeds of the advanced Soviet textile worker Valya Gaganova, who went to lagging work teams to help without compensation, she knew what she should do in the future.

    The thought of forgetting the individual for the sake of the collective immediately gripped Leicht. She never let it go and strengthened her resolve: such things must also be done in our Zittau factory as much as possible! She went to the Party organization immediately, and after joint discussions, Leicht made up her mind: go to the First Factory and help a lagging production team in the automated workshop. Someone said to her, "Irmgard, you are not being smart. There is very little technical strength in the First Factory, and there is no good work there!" However, that was precisely why she went there. Others' gossip did not shake her determination.

    Thus, on August 1, 1959, Leicht arrived at the First Factory, taking over the work of the production team led by the three foremen, Hirscher, Mattheus, and Clemens. This production team had been lagging behind in the First Factory's competition for various reasons. The team's labor organization and labor discipline were poor. They only completed 76% of the total plan in June and only 92% in July.

    Upon arriving at the First Factory, Leicht was not immediately greeted warmly. One female worker began by asking her, "Why did you come here? You will suffer losses yourself! Because in your previous production team, you could earn three marks and ten pfennigs (both "mark" and "pfennig" are currencies of the German Democratic Republic, one mark equals one hundred pfennigs) per hour, but here your wage will definitely be much lower!" Leicht responded well, saying, "If the plan is not completed, we will all suffer losses! If we cannot ultimately win in the competition between atomic war and lasting peace, then what good is fifty pfennigs more per hour for a few weeks! The militarists spare no effort to realize their plans. We must also sweat to realize our plans! And isn't our plan and sweat better?"

    It was this thought that encouraged Leicht to accept the new task. As a result, in August, the work team she led completed 117% of the daily plan, exceeding the team's production plan and producing 7,240 square meters of textiles. All the team members were determined to strive for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team." When Leicht first arrived at the new production team, her income was one mark and seventy-nine pfennigs per hour. Thirty-five days later, it reached two marks and sixty-one pfennigs per hour, approaching the income of her former work team when they fulfilled their quotas. The income of the new collective's twelve female workers also increased significantly because Leicht's experience and guidance helped them. These experiences and guidance can be summarized as follows: through professional suggestions, selfless examples, and exemplary work, she overcame the shortcomings in the team's labor organization and improved the workers' skills. But she not only introduced technical knowledge but also introduced the life and collective spirit, disciplined work processes, and good work ethic of her former work team. She did not wait for her new colleagues to come to her but went to them and said, "You should do this, because it is better and will produce more!" Theory and practice were unified for her. Therefore, this enabled her to quickly gain praise and respect. Young female worker Ingrid Schulz said to her, "Since you came here, you have helped us, led us, and supported us. So we made many efforts, and now everything has changed. What we have started will definitely be done!" Today, whether in the Zittau State-Owned Textile Combine or in many other state-owned enterprises in the German Democratic Republic, there are countless female workers who are followers of Leicht. Currently, Leicht has been awarded the honorary title of "Hero of Labor" of the German Democratic Republic, but she is not complacent about her achievements. She wants to achieve even more. Currently, she is considering how to tap into even more potential through better handover between foremen, team leaders, and female workers. There are still some female workers who do not fully prepare the textile machines after getting off work. But when the female workers in the automated workshop congratulate each other during the shift handover, these small things are overlooked. The work team has already been able to complete the daily plan very well and is already working according to the 1960 targets. If everything goes smoothly and the handover work can be further improved, even greater achievements will be created!

    The Example Set by Textile Workers in Riesa
    On the morning of September 1, 1959, the fourteen female workers, assistant foremen, and workshop directors of the textile workshop of the Riesa State-Owned Cotton Mill in the German Democratic Republic did not take the usual route they had taken for several years to their workplaces. They carried boxes, backpacks and set off on a journey to their sister factory, the Leipzig Cotton Mill, sixty kilometers away. As a united collective, they went to help the Leipzig Cotton Mill change the situation of failing to complete its plans. They were all professional veterans, almost all from "Socialist Labor Teams." Their factory, the Riesa State-Owned Cotton Mill, had been the winner of the Republic's competition five times, twice in 1959 alone.

    This by no means easy decision naturally did not fall from the sky. They had collective consultations and discussions beforehand, which were triggered by a special event. Irmgard Leicht, a female worker at the Zittau Textile Combine, learned from the example of her Soviet friend Gaganova, left her successfully working production team, and helped the lagging collective in a socialist way. This was naturally also debated in Riesa. Moreover, the Zittau textile worker's initiative had already blossomed here: fourteen Riesa textile workers and their assistant foremen and workshop directors raised the movement launched by Leicht to a higher stage and went to the Leipzig Cotton Mill, serving as a production team taking over the work of a lagging production section of the factory.

    Why did they do this? Assistant Foreman Liesel Mochik said in simple but impressive words: "What good is it if our factory overfulfills the production target and raises the plan, while our Leipzig sister factory does not reach the plan target! Therefore, it is our responsibility to help the comrades in Leipzig." Sixty-year-old Workshop Director Max Kretzsch followed the production team in order to help everyone with his rich experience. He added to Liesel Mochik's words: "Now we can also apply the socialist assistance that is shown between production teams in our factory every day from one factory to another."

    The Riesa girls worked in a production section that had previously been able to achieve only 75% of the plan on average per shift. Because in addition to the lack of labor, there were also shortcomings in labor organization. Furthermore, open competition and competition evaluation were not as good as in Riesa. These were all obstacles that the Riesa production team had to clear first. Their way of working was also quickly admired by the female workers in Leipzig. What Edith Sonnakalb, the second assistant foreman of the spinning factory No. 2 of the Leipzig factory, said most clearly showed this. She said: "I think the colleagues in Riesa are very good. What impresses me most is the unity of the Riesa production team and their good relationship with the workshop director."

    This good and solid collective was also the basis for every achievement that the Riesa female workers later made in Leipzig. On September 1, their production reached 85.5%, on September 2, it reached 95.5%, and a few days later, it exceeded their plan, reaching 105%. On October 7, the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the entire workshop completed the daily plan 102.2% for the first time in all shifts. This achievement was greater than that of the Riesa Cotton Mill because only the Leipzig factory's workshop had a larger production capacity.

    Of course, all of this was by no means as simple as it is written here. And most importantly, these outstanding figures in the Riesa production team possessed this idea: "If a factory cannot complete the plan, then the development of socialism will not proceed at the high speed we hope for, so we came here!"

    Four weeks later, another Riesa work team consisting of sixteen female workers, also starting from the same consideration, replaced the production team that was then working in Leipzig.

    The example of the Riesa textile workers appeared soon afterwards, and was widely reflected throughout the German Democratic Republic. Six female workers from the state-owned Melaener "Bana" Wool and Silk Weaving Factory came to Leipzig to provide socialist assistance at the Sino-German Wool Spinning Factory. Six electricians from the Leipzig State-Owned Strong Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factory also came to help the Berlin State-Owned Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Factory. The members of the youth team of the Weimar State-Owned "Halli Grass" Combine Harvester Factory, who were striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," left their assembly line jobs and came to the tailoring workshop, which had previously had the worst plan completion rate.

    All of them: the female cotton spinners of Riesa, the "Bana" girls of Melana, the young men of Leipzig and Weimar, all adopted a new socialist attitude towards labor, and this attitude demonstrated the new relationship of mutual assistance and comradely cooperation between the people of the German Democratic Republic.

    社会主义式的帮助
    德意志民主共和国　　赫·海德利希
    纺织女工莱希特的模范事迹
    1959年7月底以前，三十六岁的纺织女工伊尔姆加德·莱希特在德意志民主共和国齐道国营纺织联合企业第三厂工作。她是这一行的专家，她能准时完成计划，因而收入也很好。她的工作队是一个自觉的集体，在整个工厂里一直领先。可是莱希特并不满足。当第三厂定期完成计划时，而第一厂和第六厂却停滞不前，因此这两个分厂要对齐道纺织联合企业完不成八十万米纺织品的现象负主要责任。
    莱希特自从1946年起就是德国统一社会党党员，党把她教育成了有政治觉悟、能独立思考和独立行动的人。她知道，第一厂和第六厂不能完成计划，会给大家带来损失，它延迟和妨碍了共同的进步，即社会主义的胜利。她想了很久。当她有一次听到苏联先进纺织女工瓦利亚·加干诺娃不计报酬，到落后工作队去进行帮助的伟大事迹时，她知道她今后应该怎样做了。
    忘却个人，为着集体的思想立刻抓住了莱希特，她再也不肯放掉它，并且巩固了自己的意志：这样的事情也必须尽可能在我们齐道工厂办到！她马上去找党组织，经过共同的讨论后，莱希特下定了决心：到第一厂去，帮助自动化车间的一个落后生产队。有人对她说：“伊尔姆加德，你这样做是不聪明的。第一厂技术力量很少，那里没有好活儿干！”然而，她恰恰就是因为这一点而到那里去的。别人的闲话并不能动摇她的决心。
    就是这样，莱希特于1959年8月1日到了第一厂，接替了希尔雪、马特豪斯和克勒门斯三个工长领导的生产队的工作。这个生产队由于各种原因在第一厂的竞赛中一直是落后的，队的劳动组织和劳动纪律很差。他们在6月份只完成了全部计划的76％，7月也只完成了92％。
    到了第一厂以后，莱希特并没有马上受到热烈的欢迎。一个女工开头就问她：“你为什么到我们这里来？你自己会吃亏的！因为在你以前的生产队里，你每小时可以拿到三马克十分尼（“马克”和“分尼”都是德意志民主共和国货币名，一马克等于一百分尼）的工资，而在我们这里，你的工资一定要少得多！”莱希特回答得好，她说：“要是计划完不成，我们大家都得受损失！如果在原子战争和持久和平之间的竞赛中我们不能最后取得胜利，那末几个星期的计时工资多五十分尼对我又有什么用呢！军国主义者为了实现他们的计划，费尽九牛二虎之力。我们为了实现我们的计划，也要流汗！而我们的计划和汗水岂不是更好吗？”
    就是这种思想鼓励着莱希特接受了新的任务，结果是：8月份，她所领导的工作队完成了日计划的117％，超过了队生产计划，生产了七千二百四十平方米纺织品。所有的队员都下定决心争取“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号。莱希特刚来到新的生产队时，她的收入每小时为一马克七十九分尼，三十五天以后就达到每小时二马克六十一分尼，已经接近了她从前的工作队的完成定额的收入。新的集体的十二名女工的收入同样也显著地增加了。因为莱希特的经验和指导帮助了她们。这些经验和指导简单来说是这样的：她通过专业性的建议、无私的榜样和示范性的工作，克服了这个队的劳动组织方面的缺点，提高了队员的工作水平。但是她不仅仅介绍技术知识，而且也介绍她从前的工作队的生活和集体精神、有纪律的劳动过程和良好的劳动道德。她不是等待她的新同事到她这里来，而是她到她们那里去，并且对她们说：“你们应该这样做，因为这样比较好，会生产得更多！”理论和实践对她来说是统一的。因此，这使得她很快地得到好评和受到尊敬。青年女工英格里德·舒尔茨对她说：“你来到我们这里以后，帮助了我们，领导了我们，支持了我们。于是我们作了许多努力，现在一切都变了样。我们已经着手进行的事一定会办到！”今天无论是在齐道国营纺织联合企业，或是在德意志民主共和国许多其他的国营企业里，都有无数的女工是莱希特的追随者。目前，莱希特已获得了德意志民主共和国“劳动英雄”的光荣称号，可是，她并没有因为自己的成绩沾沾自喜。她还要作出更多的成绩。目前，她正在考虑：通过工长、队长和女工之间更好地交接班，还能挖掘出更多的潜力。现在还有些女工下班后，没有把纺织机完全整理就绪。但是当自动化车间的女工在接班中互相祝贺时，这些小的事情也都忽略了。这个工作队已经能够很好地完成日计划，并且已经在根据1960年的指标进行工作。如果一切进行得顺利，交接班工作也能得到进一步的改善，那末还会创造出更大的成绩！
    里沙纺织女工树立的榜样
    1959年9月1日的清晨，德意志民主共和国里沙国营棉纺厂纺织车间的十四个女工和助理工长、车间主任，没有经过几年来他们经常走的路到他们工作的地方去。她们提着箱子，背着旅行袋，踏上了前往六十公里以外的她们的姊妹厂——来比锡棉纺厂的旅途。她们作为团结一致的集体，去帮助来比锡棉纺厂改变完不成计划的状况。她们全都是专业的老手，几乎都来自“社会主义劳动队”。她们的工厂——里沙国营棉纺厂在竞赛中已五次成为共和国的得胜者，单是1959年就有两次。
    这个决非轻而易举的决心自然不是从天上掉下来的。她们事先经过集体的商量和讨论，这些商量和讨论是由于一件特殊的事件而引起的。齐道纺织联合企业的女工伊尔姆加德·莱希特学习了她的苏联女友加干诺娃的榜样，离开了她的工作顺利的生产队，用社会主义的方式帮助了落后的集体。关于这一点，自然也在里沙进行了辩论。而且齐道纺织女工的动议在这里也已经开花结果：十四个里沙的纺织女工和她们的助理工长、车间主任把莱希特掀起的运动提高到更高的阶段，并且到来比锡棉纺厂，作为生产队担任了这个厂的一个落后的生产段的工作。
    她们为什么这样做呢？助理工长里塞尔·莫希克用简单而又印象深刻的话说：“如果我们厂超额完成了生产指标，提高了计划，而我们的来比锡姊妹厂没有达到计划目标，那又有什么用呢！因此，帮助来比锡的同志是我们的责任。”六十岁的车间主任马克思·克罗茨希跟随着生产队，以便用丰富的经验帮助大家。他补充里塞尔·莫希克的话说：“现在我们也可以把每天在我们工厂生产队之间所表现出来的社会主义的帮助，从一个工厂运用到另一个工厂。”
    里沙的姑娘在一个生产段工作，这个段过去平均每班生产只能达到计划的75％。因为除了缺乏劳动力外，劳动组织也存在着缺点。再者，公开地进行竞赛和竞赛的评比不像里沙搞得那样好。这都是里沙生产队首先要清除的障碍。她们的工作方式也很快地受到了来比锡女工的敬佩，来比锡工厂纺纱二厂第二助理工长艾迪特·松纳卡尔布的话最清楚地表明了这点，她说：“我觉得里沙的同事们很好。最使我感动的是，里沙生产队的团结一致和她们与车间主任保持着良好的联系。”
    这个良好的和坚固的集体也是后来里沙女工在来比锡取得每一个成绩的基础。9月1日她们的生产达到了85．5％，9月2日又达到了95．5％，几天以后就超过了她们的计划，达到了105％。而在10月7日，德意志民主共和国成立十周年那一天，整个车间第一次在各班里完成了日计划102．2％。这个成绩比里沙棉纺厂的还要大，因为只有来比锡厂的车间有较大的生产能力。
    当然，所有这一切决不像这里所写的那样简单。而最重要的是，里沙生产队的这些优秀人物具备了这种思想：“如果一个工厂完成不了计划，那末社会主义的发展就不会像我们所希望的那样高速度前进，所以我们到这里来了！”
    四个星期以后，另一个由十六位女工组成的里沙工作队，也从同样的考虑出发，替换了当时在来比锡工作的生产队。
    里沙纺织女工的榜样出现不久，就在德意志民主共和国各地得到了广泛的反映。国营麦伦纳“巴拿”羊毛丝绸织布厂的六位女工来到了来比锡，在中德的毛纺厂进行社会主义的帮助。来比锡国营强电设备制造厂的六个电工也来帮助了柏林国营电器制造厂。正在争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的魏玛国营“哈利·格拉斯”联合收割机厂青年小队的队员，离开了他们的流水作业车间的工作岗位，来到了过去计划完成得最不好的剪裁车间。
    他们所有的人：里沙的棉纺女工、麦拉纳的“巴拿”姑娘、来比锡和魏玛的小伙子，他们都采取了一种对待劳动的社会主义的新态度，而这种态度表现了德意志民主共和国人民之间互相帮助和同志般的合作的新关系。（附图片）
    安内里丝·波尔曼是里沙最好的纺织女工之一，她在来比锡曾经看过五台纺织纱机，共一千二百三十纱锭。
