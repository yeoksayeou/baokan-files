    Slaughtering Pigs and Peeling Skin to Increase Leather Production
    Beijing Seizes the Spring Festival Slaughtering Season to Vigorously Organize Pig Skinning
    Beijing Leather Factory Produces a Variety of Exquisite and Durable Pig Leather Products
    (Our Newspaper News) In order to broaden the raw material avenues for the leather industry and meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives for leather products, Beijing is vigorously carrying out the work of peeling pigskins, taking advantage of the peak slaughtering season during the Spring Festival. About 70% of the live pigs slaughtered by the Beijing Non-Staple Food Company's slaughterhouses are now skinned before being supplied to the market. Many self-raising and self-slaughtering units have also begun to skin pigs. Now, many units have taken action, and in the past few days, they have sold more than 470 pigskins to the state.
    In order to further develop the leather industry, relevant departments have decided to make full use of the commodity pigs produced in Beijing and the live pigs raised and slaughtered by the masses this year to vigorously develop pigskin tanning and provide the leather industry with more raw material resources.
    This decision has been warmly supported and approved by the broad masses of the people. The workers of the Beijing slaughterhouse took the lead and fired the first shot in the work of pigskin peeling. In the past, the pigs slaughtered in this slaughterhouse were supplied to the market after their hair was removed. At the beginning of this year, they readjusted the labor organization, transferred more than 30 workers with skinning skills, and specially established a pigskinning section. At present, all the pigs slaughtered in this slaughterhouse are skinned, except for a few with special purposes. Since January, nearly 3,000 pigskins have been handed over to the state.
    People's communes in suburban areas and many organs, troops, enterprises, schools, and other units that raise and slaughter live pigs themselves have also actively responded to the call and vigorously grasped the work of pigskin peeling. They have sent people to slaughterhouses to learn the technology of pigskin peeling. With the enthusiastic help of the slaughterhouse workers, and through layer-by-layer teaching, more than 140 people in the city have been trained who have initially mastered the technology of pigskin peeling. Each production team in the Fengtai District People's Commune has a special person responsible for this work. Members of the communes in Chaoyang, Yanqing, Pinggu, Shunyi, and Huairou districts and counties resolutely guarantee that the pigs slaughtered before the Spring Festival will be skinned. Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company also sent two workers to the slaughterhouse to learn pigskinning technology, preparing to skin all the pigs raised and slaughtered by themselves.
    (Our Newspaper News) With the cooperation of scientific research departments, the Beijing Leather Factory has vigorously carried out the beautification of pig leather, and has successively trial-produced a variety of exquisite and durable pig leather and pig leather products.
    Last year, in order to vigorously utilize pigskin for leather making, the Central Ministry of Light Industry issued a call to beautify pig leather. The workers of this factory responded to this call and were determined to process pig leather more beautifully and exquisitely. They absorbed the experience of the Ministry of Light Industry in conducting pig leather beautification experiments in Shanghai, and with the cooperation of the Municipal Leather and Fur Research Institute, vigorously carried out the trial production of pig leather beautification. After several months of efforts, the factory has successfully trial-produced 15 kinds of beautified pig leather, some of which have been put into batch production. For example, a kind of corrected grain leather they successfully trial-produced is to polish the original relatively rough surface of the pigskin and then press extremely fine patterns on it, making it delicate and bright, becoming an excellent material for making leather shoes. There is also a kind of suede leather, commonly known as reversed leather, which has delicate绒毛(rong mao - fine hairs/down) and bright colors, and can be completely compared to deerskin. They also used the characteristic that pigskin is easy to color to trial-produce a kind of embossed multi-color leather, which is to first apply a base color to pigskin that has been pressed with different patterns, and then spray different face colors, forming various beautiful patterns on the leather surface. This kind of embossed multi-color leather can be used to make shoes, and can also be used to make large and small leather bags.
    At present, the city is vigorously peeling pigskin, and the supply of pigskin will greatly increase. This factory is actively preparing conditions to put various beautified pig leathers into production quickly. The tanning workshop has already modified the machinery and equipment and adjusted the labor organization. The shoe-making workshop has designed more than 40 new patterns of pigskin shoes, and more than 20 of them have been put into production. During the Spring Festival, the factory will manufacture a large number of beautified pig leather daily necessities to supply the market. At the same time, the factory has established a professional team to further carry out the research and development of beautified pig leather, and continue to trial-produce more new varieties and improve the quality of existing varieties.

    宰猪剥皮　增产皮革
    北京抓紧春节屠宰旺季大力组织剥猪皮
    北京制革厂制成多种精美耐用的猪革制品
    本报讯　为了给皮革工业广开原料门路，满足工农业生产和人民生活对皮革制品的需要，北京正在利用春节屠宰旺季大力开展剥制猪皮的工作。北京副食品公司屠宰场宰的生猪，已经有70％左右做到了剥皮后再供应市场。许多自养自宰的单位，也开始剥猪皮了。现在，许多单位已经行动起来，最近几天内就出售给国家猪皮四百七十多张。
    为了进一步发展皮革工业，有关部门决定在今年内充分利用北京市生产的商品猪和群众自养自宰的活猪，大力发展猪皮制革，给皮革工业提供更多的原料资源。
    这一决定得到了广大群众热烈的支持和赞同。北京市屠宰场的职工一马当先，打响了猪皮开剥工作的头一炮。这个场过去宰的猪，都是退了毛就供应市场。今年初，他们重新调整了劳动组织，抽调了三十多名有剥皮技术的工人，专门建立了一个剥猪皮工段。目前，这个屠宰场宰的猪，除了一部分有特殊用途的以外，全部剥了皮。1月份以来，已缴给国家猪皮近三千张。
    郊区各人民公社和许多自养自宰活猪的机关、部队、企业、学校等单位，也积极响应号召，大抓猪皮开剥工作，他们纷纷派人到屠宰场去学习剥猪皮的技术。在屠宰场职工的热情帮助下，通过层层传授，目前全市各单位已经培养出一百四十多名初步掌握了剥猪皮技术人员。丰台区各人民公社的每一个生产队都有专人负责这项工作。朝阳、延庆、平谷、顺义、怀柔等区县各公社社员们坚决保证，在春节前宰的猪都要剥皮。石景山钢铁公司也派了两名职工去屠宰场学习剥猪皮技术，准备把自养自宰的猪全部剥皮。
    本报讯　北京市制革厂在科学研究部门的配合下，大力开展猪皮革的美化工作，先后试制成功多种精美耐用的猪革和猪革制品。
    去年，中央轻工业部为了大力利用猪皮制革，提出美化猪革的号召以后，这个厂的职工响应了这一号召，决心把猪革加工得更美观精致。他们吸取了轻工业部在上海进行美化猪革试验的经验，在市皮革皮毛研究所的配合下，大力开展了美化猪革的试制工作。经过几个月的努力，目前这个厂已经试制成功了十五种美化猪革，其中一部分已经成批投入了生产。如他们试制成功的一种修整粒面革，是把猪皮原来比较粗糙的皮面磨光，再压上极细的花纹，细致光亮，成了做皮鞋的上好材料。还有一种绒面革，俗称翻皮，绒毛细致，颜色鲜艳，完全可以和鹿皮比美。他们还利用猪皮容易上色的特点，试制了一种压花套色革，是把压了不同花纹的猪革先上底色，再套喷不同的面色，就在革面上形成了各种美丽的图案。这种压花套色革可以做鞋，也可以制作大小皮包。
    目前全市正大力开剥猪皮，猪皮供应将有很大增长。这个厂正在积极准备条件，使各种美化猪革迅速投入生产。制革车间已经改装了机器设备，调整了劳动组织。制鞋车间已经设计出四十多种猪皮鞋的新花样，有二十多种已经投入生产。春节期间，这个厂将制造出一大批美化猪革的日用品供应市场。与此同时，这个厂又建立了专业小组，进一步开展美化猪革的研究工作，继续试制更多的新品种和提高现有品种的质量。（附图片）
