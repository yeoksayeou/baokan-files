Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 3rd. After more than a month of hard work, Henan Province has made great achievements in winter water conservancy construction. From October 1st to December 29th last year, the province completed 3 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, accounting for 75% of the winter and spring water conservancy construction plan. The average work efficiency of the province has increased from 1.1 cubic meters at the beginning to 9.1 cubic meters. Now, seventeen counties and cities, including Nanyang, Dengxian, Xichuan, and Xincai, have overfulfilled the earth and stone work tasks for winter and spring water conservancy construction.

The focus of Henan Province's winter water conservancy construction is irrigation projects. More than 360,000 channels, more than 56,000 ponds and dams, more than 140,000 wells, and more than 9,000 artesian springs have been built. The completed and under-construction projects can expand the irrigated area by 21 million mu and improve the irrigated area by 20 million mu. Mountainous and hilly areas have focused on soil and water conservation, and the completed reservoirs, terraces, valley dams, fish scale pits and other projects have initially controlled soil erosion in an area of 8,000 square kilometers. Low-lying and flood-prone areas are mainly engaged in flood control, and more than 21,000 networked channels have been excavated, with a total length of more than 31,000 kilometers. While vigorously building small projects, the province has also actively built many large and medium-sized water conservancy projects.

A major feature of this winter water conservancy construction in Henan Province is comprehensive management, so that water conservancy construction can play a comprehensive role in irrigation, flood control, drainage, soil and water conservation, shipping, power generation, and aquaculture development. When managing rivers, dams, ship locks, hydropower stations, etc. were built. For example, in the management of the Jialu River basin, more than 30 major cascade projects were built. Through the cascade projects of the main rivers, self-flowing irrigation can be realized in an area of 18 million mu in 20 counties and cities; and county-by-county access to ships, and commune-by-commune access to wooden boats, power generation of more than 20,000 kilowatts, and the large-scale development of aquaculture and other undertakings can be achieved. In the water conservancy construction of mountainous and hilly areas, a large number of terraces, water storage irrigation, tree planting and grass planting projects are carried out to achieve comprehensive management of ditches and slopes. Low-lying and flood-prone areas vigorously build river networks, and use river networks to build hydropower and hydroelectric stations, develop shipping and aquaculture.

Another feature of winter water conservancy construction in Henan Province is that it has grasped tool reform from the beginning. At present, the province has newly manufactured and reformed more than 3.6 million advanced tools, with an average of one advanced tool for every two people. The phenomenon of manual carrying has been eliminated on many water conservancy construction sites. This not only speeds up the progress of the project and shortens the construction period, but also creates favorable conditions for improving the quality of the project. According to typical surveys, more than 90% of the winter water conservancy projects that have been completed in the province have fully met the design standards. Individual poor quality ones have been repaired in time.

Henan Province also implemented the principle of easy first and difficult later, and use while managing in winter water conservancy construction. In the deployment of projects, we first focused on the finishing projects and small projects with less labor and less investment. In terms of management methods, unified leadership, centralized management, manage one place, complete one place, and use one place. Therefore, many projects have been put into use. Many newly built water conservancy projects have played a role in watering the winter wheat. More than half of the water conservancy projects that have been completed in Xuchang and Nanyang prefectures can be used, irrigating a total of 5.5 million mu of wheat.

(Reported by our newspaper) On various water conservancy construction sites in Nanyang Prefecture, Henan, advanced tools are blooming everywhere, and work efficiency is rising sharply. According to statistics as of December 24, the district has completed 69.8% of the earth and stone work planned for last winter and this spring, and the average work efficiency per person per day has increased from 11.5 cubic meters in early December to 21 cubic meters. Among them, the average work efficiency of the Huashan Reservoir in Biyang County has increased to 51 cubic meters.

The Party committees of various construction sites in the district encourage workers to carry out technical reforms with the spirit of continuous revolution. The Gongnong Lake construction site and Chengguan Commune in Xinye County are moving towards the mechanization of all construction soil on the basis of realizing the rail transportation. Gongnong Lake used a 4.5 kilowatt motor to make a Dongfeng small electric car with two trailers, which can transport 6,000 cubic meters of soil a day, which is equivalent to the workload of 600 people. According to the principle of electric plows, Chengguan Commune used electric motors to make electric rope-drawn trains, which can transport 1,400 cubic meters of soil a day. Tanghe Yuantan Commune, on the basis of vehicleization, carried out "twelve changes" (changing small cars to hopper cars, changing single cars to trains, changing dead axles to roller axles, changing dead bottoms to live bottoms, changing single-line transportation to double-line transportation, changing manual loading to automatic loading, changing manual pushing to wooden rail trains, changing single transportation to comprehensive land and air transportation, changing manual digging and cattle plowing to blasting, changing manual ramming to automatic ramming, changing manual carrying on the dam to rope traction, changing small wheels to large wheels), realized semi-mechanization, and work efficiency increased from 12.3 cubic meters to 24.3 cubic meters. Xixia County, which focuses on mountain management, implemented "five changes" (changing hoes to cattle plowing and blasting, changing iron shovels to scraper boards, changing wooden tampers to plywood tampers, changing digging to harrowing, changing crane soil to pulley soil), and the county's mountain management, excavation, and stonework increased from an average of 6.1 cubic meters per person per day to 16 cubic meters. Dengxian Xiaji created a leap forward cone based on the characteristics of the Changge rocket cone, and drilled a machine well every 10 hours on average.

Due to the development of mass tool reform campaigns, inventions and creations have sprung up. As a result, 6,800 construction sites in the district (accounting for 60% of the entire construction site) have basically realized soil mechanization and semi-mechanization, 181 construction sites have basically realized power mechanization, and 4,108 construction sites have realized vehicleization, basically eliminating shoulder carrying, and creating and imitating more than 300 kinds of tools, totaling more than 200,000 pieces. Among them, soil transportation tools account for more than 80%, and the various tracks laid on the construction site alone total 9,600, with a total length of 288,000 meters.

Leaders at all levels have always stood at the forefront of the movement, vigorously engaged in "experimental fields" to create experience. Lin Xiao, the first secretary of the prefectural party committee, braved snow and rain to go deep into the water conservancy construction sites in Biyang, Tongbai, and Xinye counties to inspect work and lead the movement. At the Gongnong Reservoir in Xinye County, he found that the wooden rail train had a large transportation volume, but the soil loading and unloading could not keep up, which often affected the operation of the wooden rail train. He and Luan Peize, the second secretary of the Xinye County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the personnel of the reservoir construction site designed a crane funnel based on the principles of the soil funnel and soil crane seen in various reservoirs in Biyang, Tongbai, and other counties, which increased efficiency by more than ten times. Soil cranes were also used for unloading. 564 secretaries at the county, commune, and team levels in Biyang County have generally established "experimental fields" and have gone into the details with the vast number of migrant workers to vigorously carry out technical innovation. In order to solve the problem of insufficient technical strength, the methods of old factories bringing new factories, masters teaching apprentices, and learning from four directions were generally adopted. Dengxian transferred 954 technicians and 4,887 tools from 293 old factories to support the new factories. 2,599 people were drawn from 307 new factories to study in old factories. The 1,876 iron and woodworking workers scattered in the production teams also took 4,817 apprentices. After visiting the tool reform movement of Huashan Reservoir, Xixia County modified 22,500 various vehicles in three days. After Comrade Wang Tiancheng of Houpo Commune, Dengxian County, invented the soil train, he went to the relatively backward Weiji Reservoir to teach technology while manufacturing. The entire construction site built 88 car bodies overnight.

At present, 1.2 million water conservancy troops in the district are bravely advancing towards the goals of comprehensively realizing ball bearingization, transportation machinery powerization, compaction electricity and powerization, train railization, and soil loosening large blasting!

    河南省治水工效增长七倍
    邓县新蔡等十七县市超额完成冬春兴修水利任务
    南阳专区60％工地实现土机械化全区平均日工效二十一立方
    新华社郑州3日电　河南省冬修水利建设，经过一个多月的艰苦努力，已经取得巨大成就。从去年10月1日到12月29日，全省共完成土石方三十亿立方米，占冬春两季水利建设计划的75％。全省平均工效，由开始的一点一立方米提高到九点一立方米。现在，南阳、邓县、淅川、新蔡等十七个县市已经超额完成了冬春两季兴修水利的土石方任务。
    河南省冬修水利建设以灌溉工程为重点。现在已建成渠道三十六万多条，塘堰坝五万六千多条，打井十四万多眼，挖自流泉九千多处，已完成和正在施工的工程可以扩大灌溉面积二千一百万亩，改善灌溉面积二千万亩。山区和丘陵区着重开展了水土保持工作，已完成的水库、梯田、谷坊、鱼鳞坑等工程，初步治理水土流失面积八千平方公里。低洼易涝区以除涝工作为主，开挖河网化渠道二万一千多条，共长三万一千多公里。全省在大力兴建小型工程的同时，还积极兴建了许多大、中型水利工程。
    河南省这次冬季水利建设的主要特点是：综合治理，使水利建设能够发挥灌溉、防洪、除涝、保持水土、航运、发电、发展水产等方面综合利用的作用。在治理河道时，都修建了拦河坝、船闸、水电站等。如在治理贾鲁河流域时，共兴建主要梯级工程三十多处。通过主要河道的梯级工程，可以在二十个县市一千八百万亩的面积上实现灌溉自流化；并且达到县县通轮船、社社通木船，发电二万多瓩，大量发展水产等事业。在山区和丘陵区水利建设中，大做梯田、蓄水灌溉、植树种草等工程，达到沟坡兼治。低洼易涝地区则大力兴建河网，并且利用河网兴建水力和水电站、发展航运和水产。
    一开始就抓紧工具改革是河南省冬修水利的另一特点。目前，全省共新制和改制的先进工具三百六十多万件，平均每两人就有一件先进工具。很多水利工地上已经消灭了人力挑抬现象。这样，不但加快了工程进度，缩短了施工期限，而且也为提高工程质量创造了有利条件。据典型调查，全省已完工的冬修水利工程中，有90％以上的工程完全达到了设计标准。个别质量差的，都及时补修好了。
    河南省在冬修水利建设中还贯彻了先易后难、边治边用的原则。在工程部署上，首先抓紧了收尾工程和用工少、投资少的小型工程。在治理方法上，统一领导，集中治理，治一处，成一处，用一处。因此目前已有不少工程投入使用。有很多新建的水利工程在给小麦浇封冻水时发挥了效益。许昌、南阳两个专区已经建成的水利工程，有一半以上已经能使用了，共浇小麦五百五十万亩。
    本报讯　河南南阳专区各水利工地上，先进工具如百花齐放，工效直线上升。截至12月24日统计，全区已完成土石方占去冬今春计划的69．8％，平均每人每天工效由12月初的十一点五立方米提高到二十一立方米。其中泌阳县的华山水库的平均工效更提高到五十一立方米。
    全区各工地党委都以不断革命的精神鼓励工人大搞技术改革。新野县工农湖工地和城关公社在实现运输轨道化的基础上，又向全部施工土机械化迈进。工农湖用四点五瓩的电动机，制成了东风小电车，带两个拖斗，一天可运土六千立方米，相当于六百人的工作量。城关公社根据电犁的原理，用电动机制成电动绳索牵引列车，一天运土一千四百立方米。唐河源潭公社在车子化的基础上，又进行了“十二改”（小车改斗车、单车改列车、改死轴为滚轴、改死底为活底、改单线运输为双线运输、改人上土为自动上土、改人推车为木轨列车、改单项运输为空陆全面运输、改人挖牛犁为爆破、改人夯为自动夯、上坝改人担为绳索牵引、改小轮为大轮），实现了半机械化，工效由十二点三立方米提高到二十四点三立方米。以治山为重点的西峡县，实行“五改”（改镢头为牛犁爆破、改铁锨为?板、改木夯为合板夯，改挖土为耖子耖，改吊杆系土为滑子拉土），全县治山挖土石方由每人每天平均六点一立方米提高到十六立方米。邓县下集根据长葛火箭锥特点，又创造了跃进锥，平均十小时打机井一眼。
    由于开展了群众性的工具改革运动，发明创造风起云涌。从而使全区六千八百处工地（占整个工地60％）基本实现了土机械化和半机械化，一百八十一处工地基本上实现了动力机械化，有四千一百零八处工地实现了车子化，基本上消灭了肩担，并创制、仿制各种工具三百余种、二十万件。其中，运土工具占80％以上，仅工地铺设的各种轨道就有九千六百条，总长二十八万八千米。
    各级领导始终站在运动的最前列，大搞“试验田”创造经验，地委第一书记林晓同志冒着雪雨，深入泌阳、桐柏、新野等县水利建设工地，检查工作，领导运动。在新野县工农水库，他发现木轨列车运量大，装土卸土跟不上，经常影响木轨列车运转，他就和中共新野县委第二书记栾培泽及水库工地的人员根据在泌阳、桐柏等县各水库看到的装土漏斗和土吊车的道理，设计了一种吊车漏斗，提高效率达十倍以上。卸土也用了土吊车。泌阳县、社、队三级书记五百六十四人，普遍建立了“试验田”，具体深入同广大民工一道大搞技术革新。为解决技术力量不足问题，普遍采用了老厂带新厂，以师带徒，四路取经探宝等办法。邓县从二百九十三个老厂中抽技工九百五十四人，工具四千八百八十七件，支援新厂。从三百零七个新厂中抽二千五百九十九人到老厂学习。分散在生产队的一千八百七十六个铁木工，也分别带徒弟四千八百一十七人。西峡县参观了华山水库的工具改革运动后，三天改制各种车二万二千五百辆。邓县厚坡公社王天成同志发明土火车后，到较后进的魏集水库边传授技术，边制造，全工地一夜就搞了八十八个车斗。
    目前，全区一百二十万水利大军正向全面实现滚珠轴承化，运输机械动力化，夯实电力、动力化，列车轨道化，松土大爆破化的目标奋勇前进！
