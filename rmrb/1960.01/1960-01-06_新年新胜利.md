New Year, New Victories

Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace Sets New Record at the Beginning of the Year; Coal Mines in Heilongjiang Province Achieve a Flying Start

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 4th: Workers at Baotou Steel Company's No. 1 Blast Furnace held a joint technical demonstration from the 1st to the 3rd, breaking through production bottlenecks. This increased pig iron production by more than 1,600 tons compared to the last three days of 1959, with all pig iron meeting quality standards. On the 3rd, they also set a new daily production record since the furnace was commissioned.

The achievement of No. 1 Blast Furnace has driven overall leaps forward in production across various departments of Baotou Steel. In the first three days of this year, the company's average daily pig iron production exceeded the plan by 18%; steel and iron ore production reached 15.66% and 16.83% of the monthly plan, respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th: Coal mine workers in Heilongjiang Province, on the basis of completing the 1959 national coal production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, have again achieved a flying start this year. On January 1st and 2nd, the average daily output of raw coal from province-administered coal mines increased by more than 13% compared to December 1959. On the 1st, the footage of major roadway excavation increased by 45% compared to the average daily footage in December of last year.

Currently, the workers in various mines are advancing victoriously, fighting to achieve daily red banners, ten-day red banners, and a fully red banner for the entire month.

Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Achieves Large Increases in Steel and Ore Production; Dalian Chemical Plant Compares Practical Work and Skillful Work

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 4th: Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company achieved an all-round victory in production in the first two days of the New Year. On January 1st and 2nd, steel production exceeded the operational plan by an average of 63.7%; pig iron production exceeded the operational plan by 18.35%; ore production exceeded the operational plan by 9.3%; and coke production exceeded the operational plan by 19.1%. The quality of all products has significantly improved. The qualification rate of pig iron reached 95.21%. Workers at the steelmaking plant began striving for high quality and diverse varieties on New Year's Day. In the first shift of New Year's Day, they used converters to produce high-grade silicon steel, spring steel, and high-quality rimmed steel, achieving a successful start.

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 4th: On January 1st and 2nd, the output of major products at the Dalian Chemical Plant exceeded the daily plan, with daily output increasing by 1% to 59% compared to the average daily output in December of last year.

In order to achieve a flying start this year and break the old routine of being lax at the beginning of the month and rushed at the end, workers at the Dalian Chemical Plant launched a double competition comparing practical work and skillful work starting from the first shift of New Year's Day. Workers in the alkali production workshop used quicklime instead of limestone to produce alkali, solving the critical problem of insufficient limestone. The output of soda ash on New Year's Day exceeded the average daily output in December of last year by 10%, and on the 2nd, they produced an additional 69 tons beyond the plan. Under the slogan of "Produce more fertilizer to support agriculture," workers in the ammonium sulfate workshop changed the batching method. On New Year's Day, they produced 64 tons more sulfuric acid and 204 tons more ammonium sulfate than planned. On the 2nd, they exceeded the daily ammonium sulfate production plan by 29%.

    包钢一号高炉年初创新纪录  黑龙江省各煤矿开门满堂红
    据新华社包头4日电　包头钢铁公司一号高炉上的职工，在1日至3日连续举行联合技术大表演，突破了生产关键，使生铁产量比1959年最后三天增加一千六百多吨，生铁质量全部合格。3日还创造了开炉以来日产量最高纪录。
    一号高炉的成就，带动了包钢各部门生产的全面跃进。今年头三天，全公司每天产的生铁平均超过计划18％；钢和铁矿石的产量分别达到全月计划的15．66％和16．83％。
    据新华社哈尔滨4日电　黑龙江省各煤矿职工在提前超额完成1959年国家煤炭生产计划的基础上，今年又夺得了开门满堂红。元月1、2两日，全省直属煤矿的原煤平均日产量比1959年12月提高13％多；1日的主要巷道掘进进尺比去年12月平均日进尺提高45％。
    目前，各矿职工正在乘胜前进，为夺取日日红、旬旬红、全月满堂红而奋战。
    马鞍山钢铁和矿石大增产  大连化工厂比实干比巧干
