    Oil Seed Tree
    The oil seed tree (also known as *Caragana sinica*), scientifically named *Nyssa sinensis*, belongs to the Cornaceae family and is a deciduous tree. Each tree typically produces from a dozen to over a hundred *jin* of seeds. The seeds are rich in oil, with an oil content of about 39%, which is comparable to that of peanuts and twice as high as that of soybeans. The oil can be used for human consumption, and the wood is fine and hard, suitable for making vehicle beams, frames, farm implements, and furniture.
    In the past, the traditional method used by the masses to extract oil from oil seed tree seeds was as follows: first, the ripe seeds were winnowed to remove impurities, then crushed into powder using a millstone. Next, 20% boiling water was added and stirred evenly, then wrapped in a thin cloth and pressed in a press. The oil yield was generally between 33% and 35%. The oil initially appears light green, and after clarification, it becomes light yellow and transparent, resembling soybean oil. It has a fragrant and pleasant taste when cooked (after refining). The seed cake after oil extraction can be used as feed and fertilizer.
    Oil seed trees are suitable for growing on hillsides and along dikes. Generally, sowing around the Beginning of Winter (立冬) is most appropriate. Each *jin* of seeds can produce more than three thousand seedlings. Seeds sown in winter of the first year will germinate and grow into seedlings in the spring of the following year, and the seedlings can be transplanted in the winter of the same year.

    油种子树
    油种子树（车梁木）学名毛徕，四照花科，属落叶乔木。这种树每株一般产子实十几斤至百多斤不等。籽实含油丰富，含油量达百分之三十九左右，相当花生的含油量，比大豆含油量高两倍。油可供人食用，木质细致坚硬，可作车梁、车架、农具和家具。
    用油种子树子实榨油，过去群众采取的土法是：先将成熟种子扬净去杂，用碾轧成碎沫，再加百分之二十开水，搅拌均匀后，用稀布包好，放入榨中加压。出油率一般在百分之三十三至百分之三十五。油先呈淡绿色，澄清后淡黄透明，状似豆油，烹食清香适口（要炼一下）。榨油后的子饼可作饲料和肥料。
    油种子树适于在山坡、地堰边生长。一般在立冬前后播种最为适宜。每斤种子可育苗三千多株。头年冬播种，来年春发芽长苗，当年冬天就可以移苗栽种。
