In 1959, the United States intensified its military alliances with Japan, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan; plotted to assemble a "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" centered on Japan, including the Syngman Rhee clique, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan; strengthened its military control over the "Central Treaty Organization"; provoked civil war in Laos and interfered in Laotian internal affairs; intensified war preparations in South Vietnam; turned South Korea into a US nuclear war base; continued to occupy Taiwan, and never ceased its military provocations against China.

Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: According to our reporter, in 1959, the people of Asia deeply realized that the greatest threat to peace and security in Asia came from the war and aggression policies of the United States. Throughout the year, the United States continuously created tense situations in Asia, intensified the conclusion of new military alliances, carried out nuclear armament, and conspired to fill the gaps in its military bloc network in Asia, thereby establishing a complete war machine against socialist countries and the people of other Asian countries.

The activities of concluding a new US-Japan "Security Treaty" with the Nobusuke Kishi government of Japan was a prominent effort made by the United States throughout the year to realize the above-mentioned conspiracy. Under the firm opposition of the Japanese people, the schedule for concluding this new US-Japan military alliance has been greatly delayed. However, the United States insisted on conducting negotiations with the Kishi Nobusuke government on revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" throughout the year, and announced in December that it would conclude this military alliance in Washington in January 1960. According to the terms of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" that have been revealed, the United States will be able to freely turn Japan into its nuclear war base, and can launch joint military operations with the nuclear-armed Japanese army in vast areas of the Far East to invade the Soviet Union, China, and Southeast Asian countries.

Signing a new US-Japan "Security Treaty" is an important link in establishing a "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" centered on Japan, including the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan. In mid-November this year, US Pacific Commander-in-Chief Felt convened a secret meeting in Baguio attended by military leaders from Japan, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan to plan the organization of this long-planned Northeast Asian aggressive bloc. Once this new military alliance is concluded, the United States will link it with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the ANZUS Treaty Organization, thereby completing the military bloc network in eastern Asia that threatens socialist countries and Southeast Asian countries.

At the same time, the United States painstakingly re-supported the Middle East aggressive bloc, which had been paralyzed by the Iraqi revolution, so that it could continue to serve as a tool for threatening the Soviet Union and suppressing the national independence movement in the Middle East. This aggressive bloc has repeatedly conspired to subvert the Republic of Iraq. At the same time, the United States is further replacing Britain and strengthening its control over the military bloc that bears the new signboard of the "Central Treaty Organization." In October this year, the Central Treaty Organization held its first Council meeting in Washington, the capital of the United States, which is not its member, and the meeting decided to establish a "Joint Command" of the Central Treaty Organization next year, with an American serving as the chairman of the military committee and the chief of staff of the permanent military representative group of this military bloc.

In March this year, the United States separately concluded bilateral military agreements with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan, the three Muslim member states of the Central Treaty Organization. In this way, the United States, through the bilateral military treaties it signed with most of the member states of the military bloc, formed a chain connecting the various military blocs with itself as the core. In the future, as long as the United States provokes a war in one region, it can force the member states of these military blocs to act as its vanguard.

At the same time, the United States is further turning these countries into its nuclear war bases. The bilateral military agreements signed by the United States with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan in March this year specifically stipulated that the United States can establish missile bases on their territories. In fact, the United States has already begun to build such bases in these countries. In addition, in the past year, the United States has also transported aircraft equipped with missiles into Japan, transported intermediate-range missiles with nuclear warheads into Okinawa, and transported "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles into South Korea, where missile bases have already been built.

In the past year, the United States has never relaxed its activities of creating tense situations in Asia. In May this year, the war ignited by the United States in Laos destroyed the peace that had emerged in the Indochina region after the 1954 Geneva Conference. At that time, the US troops stationed in the Far East and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization were eager to move, creating a new explosive situation in Asia after the United States was forced to withdraw from Lebanon last year. The United States provoked war in Laos in order to strangle the patriotic and democratic forces in Laos and place Laos completely under its military control, thereby bringing new war threats to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Chinese border.

The US action of provoking civil war in Laos is only part of its activities to undermine the Geneva Accords on the Indochina issue and create tense situations in the Southeast Asian region. In the past year, the United States has sent a large number of senior military personnel to South Vietnam to conduct war preparations, and has intensified the construction of a large number of naval and air force bases and strategic highway networks connecting South Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand in South Vietnam, and has successively transported a large number of military materials and military personnel into South Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into an important springboard for the United States to launch aggressive wars in Southeast Asia. The war materials provided by the United States to the Laotian government for fighting the civil war were transported through South Vietnam and Thailand.

In another place in Asia bound by the armistice agreement—Korea—after the Chinese People's Volunteers had completely withdrawn from Korea, the US aggressor troops not only continued to rely on South Korea, but also constantly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, transporting new weapons, including rocket weapons and nuclear weapons, into South Korea, thereby in fact turning South Korea into its nuclear war base.

In the past year, senior US military leaders in the Far East openly stated in their warmongering clamors that the main target of the US war preparations in East Asia is China. US Pacific Commander-in-Chief Felt openly clamored in a speech in Honolulu on November 23 that the United States must continue to occupy Okinawa. He said that Okinawa is an "important link in the chain" for the United States to deal with China in the Pacific region. He also threatened that small-scale wars could break out in Asia at any time. In fact, the United States has not only continued to occupy Taiwan in the past year, but has never ceased its military provocations against China. As of December 10, 1959, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued thirty-two serious warnings regarding military provocations by US Air Force aircraft and naval vessels invading China's territorial waters and airspace.

US President Eisenhower recently talked a lot about the "genuine sincerity" of the United States "in seeking peace" before his visit abroad. But in the face of the above-mentioned facts of intensifying the creation of tense situations, how can people believe these beautiful words? Eisenhower himself also knew that "many people" "still have many doubts about the genuine sincerity of the United States in seeking peace." He said that although the United States "emphasized" its "sincerity for peace" "through the Secretary of State" and the President's "own speeches," "it does not seem to have been completely successful." Now it seems that Eisenhower's trip around the world to peddle the United States' "sincerity for peace" has still not been successful.

    亚洲和平的最大威胁来自美国
    美国的“和平诚意”欺骗不了亚洲各国人民
    新华社12月31日讯　本社记者报道：1959年，亚洲人民切身体会到，对亚洲和平和安全的最大威胁来自美国的战争和侵略政策。在这一年中，美国在亚洲不断制造紧张局势，加紧缔结新的军事同盟、进行核武装化，阴谋填补上它在亚洲的军事集团网的空隙，从而建立起一个完整的反对社会主义国家和其它亚洲国家人民的战争机器。
    同日本岸信介政府缔结新的日美“安全条约”的活动是美国这一年来为实现上述阴谋所作的突出的努力。在日本人民的坚决反对下，缔结这项新的日美军事同盟的日程表已经被大大推迟。但是，美国在这一年中同岸信介政府坚持进行了关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，并且在12月间宣布要在1960年1月在华盛顿缔结这个军事同盟。根据已经透露的这项新的日美“安全条约”的条款，美国将可以放手把日本变成它的核战争基地，并且可以同核武装起来的日本军队在远东广大地区发动联合军事行动，来侵略苏联、中国和东南亚国家。
    签订新的日美“安全条约”，是建立以日本为核心、包括南朝鲜李承晚集团、菲律宾和台湾蒋介石集团在内的“东北亚军事联盟”的重要环节。今年11月中，美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特曾在碧瑶召集有日本、菲律宾和台湾蒋介石集团的军事首脑参加的秘密会议，策划组织这个酝酿已久的东北亚侵略集团。这个新的军事同盟一旦缔结，美国就将使它同东南亚条约组织和美澳新条约组织联系呼应，从而完成在亚洲东部威胁社会主义国家和东南亚国家的军事集团网。
    同时，美国苦心孤诣地把由于伊拉克革命而一度瘫痪的中东侵略集团重新支撑起来，使它继续充当威胁苏联和镇压中东民族独立运动的工具。这个侵略集团一再阴谋颠覆伊拉克共和国。同时美国正在进一步取代英国，加强对这个挂着“中央条约组织”的新招牌的军事集团的控制。今年10月，中央条约组织第一次在并非它的成员国美国的首都华盛顿举行了理事会会议，这次会议决定明年成立中央条约组织“联合司令部”，并且由美国人担任这个军事集团的军事委员会主席和常设军事代表小组的参谋长。
    美国在今年3月同中央条约组织的三个穆斯林成员国伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦分别缔结了双边军事协定。这样，美国就通过它同大多数军事集团成员国签订的双边军事条约，以自己为核心，结成一条串联各个军事集团的锁链。日后，美国只要在一个地区挑起战火，就可以迫使这些军事集团的成员国为它充头阵。
    同时，美国正在进一步把这些国家变成它的核战争基地。今年3月美国同伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦签订的双边军事协定就特别规定，美国可以在它们的领土上设立导弹基地。实际上，美国已经开始在这些国家中建立这种基地。除此以外，美国在过去一年中，还把配备有导弹的飞机运进日本，把装有核弹头的中程导弹运进冲绳，把“响尾蛇式”空对空导弹运进已经建有导弹基地的南朝鲜。
    过去一年中，美国始终没有放松它在亚洲制造紧张局势的活动。今年5月，美国在老挝挑起的战火破坏了1954年日内瓦会议以后在印度支那地区出现的和平。当时，美国驻远东的军队和东南亚条约组织蠢蠢欲动，在亚洲造成了美国去年被迫从黎巴嫩撤军后的新的具有爆炸性的局势。美国在老挝挑起战火，是为了绞杀老挝的爱国民主力量和把老挝完全置于它的军事控制之下，进而把新的战争威胁带到越南民主共和国和中国边界。
    美国挑起老挝内战的行动不过是它破坏关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议和在东南亚地区制造紧张局势的活动的一部分。在过去一年中，美国派遣大批高级军事人员到南越进行备战活动，并且在南越加紧修建大批海、空军基地和连接南越、老挝和泰国的战略公路网，陆续把大批军事物资和军事人员运进南越，把南越变成美国在东南亚发动侵略战争的重要跳板。美国提供老挝政府用来打内战的战争物资，就是通过南越和泰国运去的。
    在亚洲另一个受着停战协定约束的地方——朝鲜，美国侵略军在中国人民志愿军已经全部撤离朝鲜以后，不仅依然赖在南朝鲜，而且不断违反朝鲜停战协定，把包括火箭武器和核武器在内的新式武器运进南朝鲜，从而在事实上把南朝鲜变成了它的核战争基地。
    过去一年中，美国远东高级军事将领在他们发出的好战叫嚣中，公然表示美国在亚洲东部的备战活动的主要矛头是指向中国。美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特11月23日在檀香山发表谈话时，公然叫嚣美国要继续霸占冲绳。他说，冲绳是美国在太平洋一带对付中国的“锁链的重要环节”。他还威胁说，在亚洲，任何时候都可能发生小规模战争。事实上，美国在过去一年中不仅继续霸占台湾，而且从未停止对中国的军事挑衅。截止1959年12月10日为止，中国外交部发言人已经就美国空军飞机和海军舰只侵入中国领海、领空的军事挑衅事件提出了三十二次严重警告。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔最近在他出国访问前，大谈美国“在谋求和平方面的真正诚意”。但是面对上述种种加紧制造紧张局势的事实，人们怎能相信这些美好的词句呢？艾森豪威尔自己也知道“许多人”“对美国谋求和平方面的真正诚意仍然有许多怀疑”。他说美国虽然“通过国务卿”和总统“本人的演说来强调”美国的“和平诚意”，“但看来似乎没有完全成功”。现在看来，艾森豪威尔这次周游各国兜售美国的“和平诚意”也仍然没有成功。
