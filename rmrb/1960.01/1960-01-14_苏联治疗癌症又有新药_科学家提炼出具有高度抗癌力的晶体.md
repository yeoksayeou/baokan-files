Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 13th - TASS reports: Soviet scientists have extracted crystalline substances with high anti-cancer power from the bark of the sea buckthorn tree. This was recently announced by Professor Shabad, Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and a renowned Soviet oncologist.

Professor Shabad pointed out that this substance, after comprehensive research and animal testing, is ready for clinical use. Professor Shabad said that there is no doubt that cancer can be treated in many cases. Soviet scientists have developed several methods for treating cancer, including surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination of both, using chemical, biological, and hormonal agents, such as sarcolysin and dopan, which have good effects and are produced in large quantities.

Soviet experts have devoted considerable effort to studying methods for selecting antibiotic-type substances with medical properties that can play a role in preventing and treating cancer.

Moscow is now starting to establish an Oncology Research Institute, where all the latest methods, including atomic energy, will be used to treat various types of cancer.

    苏联治疗癌症又有新药
    科学家提炼出具有高度抗癌力的晶体
    新华社莫斯科13日电　据塔斯社消息：苏联科学家从沙棘树皮中提炼出了具有高度抗癌力的结晶体。这是苏联科学院通讯院士、著名的苏联肿瘤学家夏巴德教授最近宣布的。
    夏巴德指出，这种物质经过全面研究并用动物作过试验后，准备临床使用。夏巴德教授说，癌症是可以治疗的这一点，在很多场合下是没有任何可怀疑之处的。苏联科学家研究出了好几种治癌的方法，其中包括外科手术、射线治疗、或这两种方法联合使用，采用化学、生物、激素等药剂，其中如溶肉流素和道潘，效果很好，已大批生产。
    苏联专家们花了不少力量研究用什么方法挑选具有医疗性能并能在防治癌症中起作用的抗生素型的物质。
    莫斯科现在开始建立肿瘤研究所，那里将用一切最新的方法，其中包括原子能，来治疗各种癌症。
