Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 3rd: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" today published a commentary on the seizure of power by Lao military leaders, stating that the most ferocious pro-American military warlord elements in Laos—the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests"—under the direct instigation and assistance of US imperialist warmongers and American military advisors in Laos, used the pressure of the military to force the newly reorganized Sananikone government to resign, and announced that they had seized all power in Laos. They want to establish an extremely reactionary military warlord dictatorship in Laos, which is in effect a military coup.

The commentary stated that a fascist crisis is seriously threatening Laos. If the Lao people and democratic forces do not promptly stop the conspiracies of those military warlord elements, then, under the direction of US imperialism, they will certainly intensify their suppression of Lao forces who love their country and love peace, while strengthening provocative activities against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and other neighboring countries, which have always insisted on defending peace in Southeast Asia. This policy will not only further expand and prolong the Lao civil war, which is beneficial to the deeper intervention of the United States, but will also make the situation more tense, seriously threatening the peace and security of Indochina and the Far East.

The commentary stated that people of all strata in Laos, as well as those with foresight in the royal family, political circles, and clergy, must unite for the sake of the Lao national interest and the interest of peace, and fight against the extremely pro-American reactionary leaders of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests."

    越南“人民报”评老挝局势
    美国直接策动军阀政变
    严重威胁远东的和平和安全
    据新华社河内3日电　越南“人民报”今天就老挝军队首脑攫取政权一事发表评论说，老挝最凶恶的亲美军阀分子——“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们，在美帝国主义好战分子和美国在老挝的军事顾问的直接唆使和帮助下，用军队的压力迫使刚刚改组的萨纳尼空政府辞职，并且宣布他们掌握了老挝的一切权力。他们要在老挝建立极其反动的军阀独裁制度，这实际上是一次军阀政变。
    评论说，法西斯危机在严重地威胁着老挝。如果老挝人民和民主力量不及时制止那些军阀分子的阴谋，那么，他们在美帝国主义的指使下，一定会变本加厉地镇压老挝爱祖国和爱和平的力量，同时加强对一向坚持保卫东南亚和平的越南民主共和国和其他邻国的挑衅活动。这种政策不仅会使老挝内战进一步扩大和延长，有利于美国的更加深入的干涉，而且还将使局势变得更加紧张，严重地威胁印度支那和远东的和平和安全。
    评论说，老挝各阶层人民和皇族中、政界中、僧侣中有远见的人，为了老挝民族利益和和平的利益，必须团结起来，为反对“保卫国家利益委员会”极端亲美的反动头目们而斗争。
