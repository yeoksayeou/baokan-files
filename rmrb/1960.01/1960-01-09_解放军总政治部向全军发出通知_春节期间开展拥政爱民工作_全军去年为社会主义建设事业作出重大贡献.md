Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice to the whole army regarding the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people during the 1960 Spring Festival.

The notice stated that the Spring Festival of 1960 is approaching. In the activities of supporting the government and cherishing the people, in addition to extending holiday greetings to residents and local comrades in the stationed areas, organizing joint celebrations, and conducting consolation activities for revolutionary martyrs' families and demobilized soldiers, it is also necessary to use various means to publicize the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes to the masses in the stationed areas and the relatives of officers and soldiers, highlighting their great role in accelerating socialist construction and improving people's lives, as well as publicizing the brilliance and greatness of the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership.

The notice requires all units to conduct inspections and summaries of the implementation of the "Outline for the Army's Participation in Socialist Construction" in 1959. Based on this, troops should be educated to further understand that participating in socialist construction not only helps the development of China's industrial and agricultural production but also plays a significant role in raising the political consciousness of the troops, promoting their work, and strengthening military-civilian relations. This will enhance the troops' consciousness and enthusiasm for participating in socialist construction. All units should formulate plans for participating in socialist construction in 1960 based on local needs and the actual possibilities of the troops.

The notice also requires all units to conduct a review of policy and discipline implementation in 1959, raise vigilance, and ensure that the people have a good Spring Festival.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th: As a shock force in socialist construction, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, while consolidating national defense and strengthening modernization in 1959, participated in industry, agriculture, and transportation with more than 40 million labor days, making significant contributions to the cause of socialist construction.

Last year, troops across the country participated in major local construction projects, including 102 new and expansion projects of industrial and mining enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, Chongqing Iron and Steel, Kunming Iron and Steel Plant, and Fujian Sanming Iron and Steel Plant. They constructed 415 kilometers of railway subgrade (excluding those built by the Railway Corps) and 11,604 kilometers of highways. To support transportation in various regions, troops dispatched more than 1.2 million vehicles, traveling more than 38.7 million kilometers and transporting more than 8 million tons of materials. The People's Air Force also dispatched more than 500 aircraft sorties to transport steel production equipment for Beijing, Shenyang, Baotou, Urumqi, Chengdu, Kunming, and other places. In urban construction, the troops participated in the construction of 393 relatively large projects, including the Great Hall of the People, the Military Museum, and the State Guesthouse in Beijing, the Qinhuai River in Nanjing, the Heping Canal in Urumqi, and the suburban railway in Dalian.

In terms of participating in agricultural construction, the People's Liberation Army invested the most in water conservancy projects. Last year, troops across the country participated in the construction of 5,631 water conservancy projects, excavating more than 22.24 million cubic meters of earth and stone. Among them, the larger ones include the Qinghe Reservoir in Liaoning, the Miyun Reservoir in Hebei, the Fenhe Reservoir in Shanxi, the Dongping Lake Reservoir in Shandong, the Puqi Reservoir in Hubei, the Yushan Reservoir in Jiangxi, the Dongzhen Reservoir in Fujian, and the Huasongba Reservoir in Yunnan. In participating in water conservancy construction, under the unified leadership of local Party committees, troops in various regions resolutely completed their tasks. Leading cadres at all levels went to the construction sites to command on the spot, just as they would execute combat missions. The broad masses of officers and soldiers fought tenaciously against floods during the continuous rainy season.

Troops across the country also contributed significantly to seasonal agricultural labor. During the summer harvest, summer planting, autumn harvest, and autumn planting, garrisons in various regions successively suspended training for five to ten days, with all personnel, vehicles, and horses dispatched to help local people's communes with the rush harvest and planting. Some troops even organized "expedition teams" to support distant communes. During the winter and spring seasons, all troops actively participated in the fertilizer accumulation campaign. The broad masses of officers and soldiers dug mud ponds, cleaned pigsties, dug toilets, and cut weeds, making every effort to find sources of fertilizer to help the people's communes accumulate fertilizer. According to incomplete statistics, they accumulated and transported more than 110 million dan of fertilizer for the communes in the past year.

In overcoming the extraordinarily severe natural disasters last year, the broad masses of officers and soldiers shared weal and woe and fought shoulder to shoulder with the people, demonstrating the noble qualities of the People's Liberation Army. In the fight against drought and locusts, in addition to dispatching a large number of personnel, the People's Air Force dispatched 721 aircraft sorties to conduct artificial rainfall and spray pesticide powder in nine provinces and autonomous regions, including Hubei, Hunan, and Inner Mongolia. When heavy rains caused disasters in the southeastern coastal areas and parts of northern China, the local army, navy, and air force went all out to participate in rescue and disaster relief, rescuing more than 116,000 disaster-stricken people, as well as rescuing a large number of cattle and materials. When the Lvsi Fishing Ground in Jiangsu was hit by a storm, and fishing boats were in great danger in the far sea, a naval unit dispatched ships, carrying life-saving equipment, braving the tenth-level typhoon, to rescue more than 20 fishing boats and 190 fishermen.

The various services and arms of the People's Liberation Army also helped various industries, including industry, agriculture, and transportation, train a number of technical personnel. The People's Air Force helped people's communes establish some weather stations and trained meteorological personnel. The motor transport units helped local transport departments train some drivers. The health departments and hospitals of the troops helped rural areas establish hospitals and also trained health workers and health technicians.

The participation of troops in national construction not only strengthened military-civilian relations but also educated themselves. After seeing the scale and prospects of national construction and the soaring enthusiasm and majestic strength of the people, the broad masses of officers and soldiers strengthened their determination and will to defend and build the motherland.

    全军去年为社会主义建设事业作出重大贡献
    新华社8日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部，最近向全军发出1960年春节拥政爱民工作的通知。
    通知说，1960年春节即将到来，部队在拥政爱民活动中，除了向驻地居民和地方工作同志贺节，组织联欢，向烈军属、复员军人进行慰问活动外，还必须运用各种方式向驻地群众和部队官兵的亲友，宣传总路线、大跃进、人民公社对加速社会主义建设和改善人民生活的巨大作用，宣传党和毛主席领导的英明伟大。
    通知要求各部队对1959年执行“军队参加社会主义建设工作纲要”的情况进行检查和总结，并在此基础上，教育部队进一步了解：参加社会主义建设，不仅有助于我国工农业生产的发展，而且对提高部队政治觉悟、推动部队工作、密切军民关系，具有重大的作用，从而提高部队参加社会主义建设的自觉性和积极性。各部队应根据地方需要和部队实际可能，制订1960年参加社会主义建设的规划。
    通知还要求各部队对1959年执行政策纪律情况作一次检查，并提高警惕，保卫人民过好春节。
    新华社8日讯　作为社会主义建设一支突击力量的中国人民解放军，1959年在巩固国防、加强现代化建设的同时，以四千多万个劳动日参加了工业、农业和交通运输业，为社会主义建设事业作出了重大贡献。
    去年，全国各地部队参加当地的重大建设工程，有鞍钢、包钢、重钢、昆明钢铁厂和福建三明钢铁厂等工矿企业的新建和扩建工程一百零二项。修建铁路路基等四百一十五公里（不包括铁道兵修的），公路一万一千六百零四公里。为了支援各地运输，部队出动汽车一百二十万多辆次，行程达三千八百七十多万公里，运输物资八百多万吨。人民空军还出动飞机五百多架次，为北京、沈阳、包头、乌鲁木齐、成都、昆明等地运输钢铁生产设备。在城市建设方面，部队参加修建的有：北京人民大会堂、军事博物馆和迎宾馆，南京的秦淮河，乌鲁木齐的和平渠，旅大市的郊区铁路等比较大的工程共三百九十三项。
    在参加农业建设方面，解放军投入力量最大的是水利工程。去年，各地部队参加修建的水利工程有五千六百三十一项，挖掘土石二千二百四十多万立方。其中比较大的有辽宁的清河水库，河北的密云水库，山西汾河水库，山东东平湖水库，湖北蒲圻水库，江西玉山水库，福建东圳水库和云南的华松坝水库等。在参加水利建设中，各地部队在地方党委的统一领导下，坚决完成任务。各级领导干部都像执行战斗任务一样，亲临工地，就地指挥；广大官兵在连绵阴雨季节，与洪水进行了顽强搏斗。
    全国各地部队出人力较多的，还有农业季节性劳动。在夏收、夏种和秋收、秋种时，各地驻军都先后停止操课五天至十天，全部人员、车、马出动，帮助驻地人民公社抢收抢种。有的部队还组织了“远征队”，支援远处的公社。在冬、春两季，各部队都踊跃参加了积肥运动。广大官兵挖泥塘、清猪圈、挖厕所、割杂草，千方百计寻找肥源，帮助人民公社积肥。据不完全统计，一年来为公社积肥和运肥达一亿一千多万担。
    在战胜去年特大的自然灾害中，广大官兵与人民群众同甘共苦，并肩战斗，表现了人民解放军的高贵品质。在抗旱、灭蝗斗争中，各部队除了出动大批人员以外，人民空军出动飞机七百二十一架次，为湖北、湖南、内蒙古等九个省、区、进行了人工降雨和喷洒灭虫药粉。东南沿海和北方部分地区暴雨成灾时，当地陆、海、空三军全力以赴地参加了抢险救灾，救出受灾群众十一万六千多人，还抢救出大批耕牛和物资。江苏吕泗渔场遭到风暴袭击，渔船在远海处境十分危险，海军某部派出舰艇，携带了救生工具，冒着十级台风，将二十多只渔船和一百九十名渔民抢救回来。
    解放军各军种、兵种、还帮助工业、农业和交通运输业等各行业，培养和训练了一批技术人员。人民空军帮助人民公社建立了一些气象站，并且培养了气象人员。汽车运输部队帮助地方运输部门训练了一些驾驶员。部队的卫生部门和医院，帮助农村建立医院，还训练了保健员和卫生技术人员等。
    部队参加国家建设，不仅密切了军民关系，也教育了自己，广大官兵看到国家建设的规模和远景，看到人民的冲天干劲和雄伟力量以后，增强了保卫祖国、建设祖国的决心和意志。
