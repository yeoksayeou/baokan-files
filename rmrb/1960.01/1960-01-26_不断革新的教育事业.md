A Visit to North Korea:

Constantly Innovating Education
Zhou Yizhi

Looking out from Moranbong Peak in Pyongyang, one can see many parks and squares amidst rows of brand-new buildings. These places are all beautifully constructed. Our North Korean comrades told us that most of Pyongyang's parks and squares were built by students in their spare time.

Communist Schools

Students from Kim Chaek University and other schools built dikes, stacked stone steps, and planted flowerbeds along the Taedong River, where willows sway and the river flows, creating a wide and flat promenade. Students from the Construction University meticulously designed and transformed a desolate valley on Moranbong Peak into a large garden. It features an open-air theater for ten thousand people, terraced flowerbeds, artificial waterfalls, and fountains... Students from Kim Il Sung University are building a resort area covering more than 1,400 hectares on Mount Daesong, eight kilometers northwest of Pyongyang. They have built a 40-kilometer winding mountain road that spirals from the foot of the mountain to the summit. There are many newly built pavilions in the woods, as well as bus stations, open-air dance floors, and theaters... Students from the Department of History and the Department of Geography have excavated many famous historical sites here. Biology students have gone to Mount Paektu and other places to capture animals and collect plant specimens, preparing to set up a zoo and botanical garden in the resort area. Every Sunday, the working people of Pyongyang come in droves to visit, admire the natural scenery and historical sites, and enjoy their holidays. Everyone praises in unison: "The students of today are truly remarkable; they can do anything."

Kim Il Sung University students Shin Young-seop and Park Jae-sun enthusiastically recounted their moving deeds of voluntary labor to Chinese reporters. On March 25, 1959, the students, carrying more than 1,000 pieces of machinery and tools of all sizes, surged onto Mount Daesong and began the year's construction project. The most exciting part was the battle to build the Eight-Character Pond. This project was estimated to take eight days to complete, but the students proposed to finish it in three days to celebrate May Day. Because the construction site could not accommodate too many people, only 200 students were selected to form a Red Flag Assault Team to take charge of this task. Many students who were not approved to participate in this battle secretly sneaked to the construction site at night to work. When the Xu Guangxue group from the Foreign Languages Department arrived at the construction site, they found many female students there. Xu Guangxue advised them to go back to rest, and they also advised the Xu Guangxue group to go back to rest. In the end, no one listened to anyone's advice. At midnight, when everyone was tired, they lit a bonfire on the mountain, recited memoirs of the anti-Japanese war, sang songs of the anti-Japanese guerrillas, and danced group dances. At this time, they seemed to have returned to the mountains and forests where the guerrillas operated in those years, feeling infinite glory and excitement. Everyone threw themselves into the intense battle again, and the efficiency of digging soil increased eightfold compared to the first half of the night. On April 30, the Eight-Character Pond was completed. Premier Kim Il Sung suddenly came to the construction site that day. The students immediately rushed to their beloved leader. The Premier praised them, saying, "You have done another remarkable thing for the people." An old man named Kim Jeong-ho also came to Mount Daesong for a visit. He exclaimed in surprise: "A few days ago, this was still a barren mountain, but now suddenly a large pool of water has appeared. There is a legend in ancient times about strong men moving mountains and filling the sea; you are such strong men." The encouragement from the Premier and the old man Kim Jeong-ho boosted the students' enthusiasm even higher.

Participating in the capital construction is one of the important contents of Pyongyang's universities implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor. The Pyongyang City Construction Committee assigns many construction tasks to various universities to be responsible for. The students of each school regard the construction site as a communist school, and they try every means to complete the tasks, dedicating the best results to the Party and the people. Since 1954, Kim Il Sung University has completed the construction projects of Moranbong Stadium, Mao Zedong Square, Mao Zedong Road, the Jiangnan Irrigation Project, and the east and west Pyongyang underground drainage systems. From 1958 to 1960, they undertook the construction task of the Daesong Mountain resort. Through this voluntary labor, the students have improved their communist ideological awareness, cultivated the excellent qualities of inheriting revolutionary traditions, and made many contributions to the country.

Scientific Research Serves Production

Choi Jae-oh, Vice Dean of Kim Il Sung University, told us that in addition to participating in capital construction labor, the school also actively implements the principle of combining education with productive labor in scientific research. He led us to see how students conduct scientific research. In the chemistry department's laboratory, a student handed us two pieces of rubber. He said that this was a new product they had recently successfully trial-produced. Korea cannot grow rubber trees, but it has a lot of limestone. The research group composed of teachers and students from the chemistry department spent three months using limestone and calcium carbide as raw materials to manufacture this synthetic rubber. Its quality is similar to that of natural rubber, and it can be used to make tires without adding natural rubber. We saw a distiller in the laboratory, which was made by the students using glass tubes and sheet metal. The director of the chemistry department told us that importing a distiller from abroad would cost 3,000 rubles, while making it ourselves only costs ten yuan. The experimental factory for trial-producing synthetic rubber is also a remodeled old warehouse. The school plans to build another factory with a daily output of 1,000 kilograms of rubber to conduct large-scale production tests, and then hand it over to the Ministry of Light Industry (the various ministries of the North Korean Cabinet are called provinces) for formal production. Kim Il Sung University students solved a problem urgently needing resolution for the country under such simple conditions.

Vice Dean Choi Jae-oh said that at present, first- and second-year students participate in productive labor for one day a week, and also engage in 42 days of productive labor during the annual 60-day vacation. Students in their third year and above carry out production internships for three months each year, engaging in activities that directly contribute to national construction. Before graduation, they must reach a technical level of Grade 5 or above. Students have achieved considerable results in scientific research and productive labor. Teachers and students in the chemistry department have successfully trial-produced melamine, which can be used as a dye to make rayon wrinkle-free and colorfast, and can also be used as electrical wire insulation cloth. Teachers and students in the physics department have created a spectral analysis soil method, which is more than 30 times more efficient than chemical analysis. They have also successfully trial-produced a fish finder that uses ultrasound to detect the whereabouts of fish schools in the sea, which is very helpful for the country's development of the fishing industry. Teachers and students in the biology department extract chlorophyll, medicines, and fuel from silkworm droppings, which have a wide range of uses.

We also visited the Jo Kun-shil High School in Wonsan. This middle school also has an experimental factory and many laboratories. The chemistry research group organized by the students experimented with weaving cloth from 130 kinds of plant fibers, such as corn stalks, wheat stalks, reed stalks, castor stalks, and tree bark, and 107 kinds have been successful. This experiment is not only beneficial to the country, but also greatly improves students' interest and performance in learning chemistry. The school's industrial room is equipped with tractors, automobiles, and some other machines. When students in the second and third grades of high school study these courses, they first study their structure and various machine parts here, and then return to the classroom to learn theory, which is much easier to understand. In a corner of the school playground, we saw two cement kilns, which are places for first-year students to carry out productive labor in conjunction with chemistry class. The machine repair workshop of this school originally had three lathes. Last year, in response to the "machine tools produce machine tools" movement, they manufactured six new lathes themselves, and also made wheat sowing machines, feed choppers, and various machine parts to support agricultural cooperatives. The school also has a sewing workshop, where female students receive semi-finished products from state-owned factories for processing. The uniforms of all the students in the school are also sewn by them. The various productions carried out by this school are included in the production plan of the province (equivalent to our country's province). This greatly enhances the students' sense of honor and responsibility, and also greatly strengthens their interest in engaging in productive labor.

Reform the Existing Education System

At present, North Korea's factories and enterprises have been equipped with advanced technology and are gradually realizing mechanization and automation. The rapid development of socialist construction requires that the working people be able to master scientific knowledge and skills, be good at using complex machines, and be able to skillfully manage and operate modern production. The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party believes that since schools at all levels implemented the combination of education and productive labor, the quality of school education has been significantly improved. However, some parts of the current people's education system are no longer suitable for the ever-developing needs of reality, especially the current senior high schools, which conduct general education and cannot adequately prepare students to participate in labor production, nor can they well adapt to their entry into universities to study specialized courses. In October 1959, the government of the Republic decided to discontinue the existing senior high schools and technical colleges, and establish a secondary technical education system that closely integrates general education and technical education.

There are currently 2.47 million students in northern Korea, an average of one student for every four people. In 1958, the country was the first in the East to implement comprehensive compulsory secondary education, and is now preparing to implement comprehensive compulsory technical education. This is another great leap forward in North Korea's education.

The technical compulsory education system that North Korea is about to implement includes: four years of people's school, three years of middle school, two years of technical school, and two years of higher technical school. After completing this stage of study, students can directly participate in production, or they can enter university (four or five years) for further study. In the 1962-1963 academic year, a nine-year technical compulsory education system will be implemented first, and every citizen will have to study in a technical school for two years after graduating from junior high school. In the 1966-1967 academic year, an eleven-year technical compulsory education system will be implemented, that is, two more years of higher technical school after graduating from technical school. The allocation ratio of courses in technical schools is: general courses account for 52%, and the educational content is equivalent to the current three-year high school courses; technical courses account for 25%, which is equivalent to the current technical college courses; the internship time accounts for 23%, which is more than the current technical college internship time.

Lee Il-kyung, Minister of Education and Culture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, told us that the Workers' Party requires that North Korea's school education ensure that students are trained to become all-round developers of socialism and communism. It is necessary to comprehensively develop political and ideological education, general education, and technical education. It is necessary to continue to implement the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, so that students can not only master the specialized knowledge they have learned, but also have the skills to directly engage in this aspect of labor. The curriculum arrangement of technical schools is to achieve such a goal. He said that one cannot learn technical courses well without learning general courses well, and neither should be neglected. On the other hand, there should be no technical supremacy thinking, and political and ideological education must be strengthened at the same time.

Trampling Difficulties Underfoot

Comrade Lee Il-kyung said that we anticipated that carrying out such a major reform would inevitably encounter many difficulties. In order to accumulate experience, 500 technical schools have been established in 1959, and more than 200,000 junior high school graduates can be enrolled in 1960, accounting for about 80% of all junior high school graduates.

The current technical schools are specialized technical schools, and relevant specialized technical courses are set up separately. There are a total of 115 different courses in 500 technical schools. In addition, some schools for music, dance, visual arts, etc., which start from the elementary school stage, and four-year sports schools that enroll junior high school graduates will be set up separately. From 1960, the enrollment of general high school students will be stopped, and existing high school students will continue to study until graduation, but technical courses will be strengthened. After the reorganization of the education system, universities will remain the same. In 1959, North Korea newly established 15 universities, and the issue of changing the school system was considered at that time, so they were all technical universities.

Comrade Lee Il-kyung said that in the early days of implementing compulsory technical education, the first difficulty encountered was the issue of teachers. We transferred a group of graduates from past technical colleges, and the normal science departments of various universities cultivated them for one year, and then sent them to newly established technical schools to teach technical courses. In addition, we also transferred a group of high school graduates, conducted one year of normal education, and sent them to junior high schools to teach, and extracted a part of the original excellent teachers from junior high schools and sent them to technical schools to teach general courses. Doing so may reduce the current teaching quality, but from a long-term perspective, this problem can be solved quickly. Another difficulty is the distribution of schools and student dormitories. Assuming that a county has five technical schools such as industry, agriculture, and commerce, none of them have dormitories. The furthest commuting distance for students is 30 li. If someone wants to study industry, but there is only an agricultural school nearby, what should they do? To solve this problem, it is best to build dormitories. However, at present, North Korea has a shortage of labor, and building dormitories and equipping chefs are not easy tasks. Therefore, we temporarily do not allow boarding schools to be run, and let each county consider the distribution of technical schools and courses according to the needs of local economic development, so as to better adapt to the current specific situation. At the same time, we also mobilize the masses to find their own ways to solve the students' accommodation problems.

Comrade Lee Il-kyung said that this is how we are constantly creating and innovating in the process of practice. No difficulty can stop our progress. With the correct direction, we will definitely be able to create conditions to make North Korea's education system increasingly perfect. (With picture)

    不断革新的教育事业
    周毅之
    从牡丹峰上眺望平壤，可以看见在一排排崭新的楼房中间，有许多公园和广场。这些地方修得都非常漂亮。朝鲜同志告诉我们，平壤的公园和广场，大多数是学生们利用课余时间修建的。
    共产主义学校
    金策大学等校学生在杨柳依依、江水潺湲的大同江边筑堤坝，叠石阶，辟花圃，修建了一条宽阔平坦的游览马路。建设大学的学生们精心设计，把牡丹峰上的荒废山谷，修建成一座大花园。那里有万人露天剧场、梯田式花坛、人造瀑布和喷水池……。金日成大学学生正在平壤西北八公里的大城山建设一个面积达一千四百多公顷的游览地。他们修筑了四十公里的环山道路，从山脚弯弯曲曲地盘旋到山顶。树林里有许多新建的亭台，还有汽车站、露天舞场和剧场……。历史系和地理系的学生在这里发掘出许多著名的古迹。生物系学生到白头山等地捕捉动物，采集植物标本，准备布置游览地的动物园和植物园。每逢星期天，平壤市的劳动人民成群结队地到这里来游览，欣赏自然景色和名胜古迹，欢度假日。大家都异口同声地赞扬道：“现在的学生真了不起，他们什么都能干。”
    金日成大学学生申荣燮和朴在善眉飞色舞地向中国记者们叙述他们进行义务劳动的动人事迹。1959年3月25日，同学们带着一千多件大大小小的机械和工具，浩浩荡荡地涌上大城山，开始本年度的建设工程。最令人兴奋的是修筑八字池的战斗。这个工程预计要八天才能完成，但是同学们提出，争取在三天内完工庆祝“五一”节。因为工地不能容纳太多人，只好挑选出二百个同学，组成红旗突击队，负责这项任务。许多同学没有被批准参加这一次战斗，夜里，他们偷偷地摸到工地劳动。外文系徐光学小组来到工地的时候，发现那里有许多女同学。徐光学劝她们回去休息，她们也劝徐光学小组回去休息。结果谁也没有听谁的劝告。午夜，大家累了，他们就在山上燃起篝火，朗诵抗日战争回忆录，高唱抗日游击队的歌曲，跳集体舞。这时，他们仿佛又回到当年游击队活动的山林里，感到无限光荣和兴奋，大家又投入紧张的战斗，挖土效率比上半夜提高八倍。4月30日，八字池完工。金日成首相这一天突然来到工地。同学们立即涌到自己亲爱的领袖跟前。首相赞扬他们说：“你们又为人民做了一件了不起的事”。有一位名叫金正浩的老大爷也到大城山游览。他惊讶地说：“前几天这里还是一座荒山，现在忽然出现了一个大水池。古代有大力士移山填海的传说，你们就是这样的大力士”。首相和金正浩老大爷的勉励，把同学们的干劲鼓得更高了。
    参加首都建设是平壤各大学执行党的教育与生产劳动相结合政策的重要内容之一。平壤市建设委员会把许多建设任务，分别包给各大学负责。各校学生都把工地当作共产主义学校，他们想尽办法完成任务，用最好的成绩献给党和人民。金日成大学从1954年起，已经完成了牡丹峰运动场、毛泽东广场、毛泽东路、江南灌溉工程和东、西平壤地下水道等建设工程。1958年到1960年，他们又负担起大城山游览地的建设任务。学生们通过这种义务劳动，提高了共产主义的思想觉悟，培养了继承革命传统的优良品质，还对国家作出了许多贡献。
    科学研究为生产服务
    金日成大学副教务长崔在午告诉我们，除了参加首都建设劳动之外，学校在科学研究方面，也积极贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的原则。他领我们去看学生们怎样进行科学研究。在化学系实验室，一位同学递给我们两片橡胶。他说，这是他们最近试制成功的新产品。朝鲜不能种橡胶，但是石灰石却很多。化学系师生组成的研究组花了三个月时间，用石灰石和电石作原料，制造出这种合成橡胶，质量和天然橡胶差不多，用它来作轮胎，不必再掺天然胶。我们看见实验室里有一架蒸馏器，是学生们用玻璃管和铁皮制造的。化学系主任告诉我们，从外国进口一架蒸馏器要花三千卢布，自己造只要十块钱。试制合成橡胶的实验工厂也是一个旧仓库改建的。学校准备再建一个日产一千公斤橡胶的工厂，进行较大规模的生产试验，然后交给轻工业省（朝鲜内阁各部叫做省）正式生产。金日成大学的学生就在这样简陋的条件下，为国家解决了一个迫切需要解决的问题。
    崔在午副教务长说，目前一、二年级学生每周参加生产劳动一天，还在每年六十天的假期中进行四十二天生产劳动。三年级以上每年进行生产实习三个月，从事对国家建设有直接贡献的活动。毕业以前要达到五级工以上的技术水平。学生们在科学研究和生产劳动方面取得了不少成绩。化学系师生已经试制成功三聚氰胺，用它作染料可以使人造纤维不绉，不脱色，还可以作电线绝缘布。物理系师生创造了光谱分析土壤法，效率比化学分析提高三十多倍。他们还试制成功一种探鱼器，用超音波来探知海里的鱼群行踪，对国家发展渔业很有帮助。生物系师生在蚕粪中提炼出叶绿素、药品和燃料，用途很广。
    我们还参观了元山市的赵君实高中。这个中学也有实验工厂和许多实验室。学生们组织的化学研究小组，试验用玉米秆、麦子秆、芦苇秆、蓖麻秆和树皮等一百三十种植物纤维织布，已经有一百零七种成功。这种试验不仅对国家有好处，还大大提高了学生学习化学的兴趣和成绩。学校里的工业室设有拖拉机、汽车和一些别的机器，高中二、三年级学生学到这些课程的时候，先在这里研究它们的结构和各种机器零件，再回到课堂学理论，领会起来就容易得多。在学校操场的一角，我们看到两个水泥烧成炉，这是高一同学结合化学课进行生产劳动的场所。这个学校的机修车间原有三台车床，去年响应“机床生产机床”运动，自己制造了六台新车床，还造了小麦播种机、饲料切碎机和各种机器零件，支援农业合作社。学校里还有一个缝纫车间，女生们向国营工厂领半成品回来加工。全校同学的制服，也都是她们缝制的。这个学校所进行的各项生产，都列入道（相当于我国的省）的生产计划。这样做大大增强了同学们的光荣感和责任心，也大大加强了他们进行生产劳动的兴趣。
    改革现行教育制度
    目前，朝鲜的工厂和企业，已经用先进的技术装备起来，正在逐步实现机械化和自动化。社会主义建设的迅速发展，要求劳动人民都能够掌握科学知识和技能，善于使用复杂的机器，能够熟练地经营管理现代化生产。朝鲜劳动党中央认为，自从各级学校实行教育和生产劳动相结合以后，学校教育的质量有了显著提高。但是，现行的人民教育制度中的一部分，已经不适合于不断发展的现实需要，特别是现在的高级中学，进行的是一般教育，不能为学生参加劳动生产作好充分准备，对他们升入大学学习专业课程，也不能很好适应。1959年10月，共和国政府决定停办现存的高级中学和技术专科学校，建立一般教育和技术教育密切结合的中等技术教育体系。
    朝鲜北部目前有二百四十七万学生，即平均四个人中有一个学生。1958年，这个国家在东方首先实行全面的中等义务教育，现在又准备实行全面技术义务教育。这是朝鲜教育事业的又一次大跃进。
    朝鲜即将实行的技术义务教育制度，包括：人民学校四年，中学三年，技术学校二年，高等技术学校二年。学生完成了这一阶段的学习后，可以直接参加生产，也可以进入大学（四年或五年）继续深造。1962—1963学年首先要实现九年制的技术义务教育，每个公民在初中毕业以后，还要念两年技术学校。到1966—1967学年实行十一年制的技术义务教育，即技术学校毕业后再念两年高等技术学校。技术学校课程的分配比例是：一般课程占52％，教育内容等于现在高中三年的课程；技术课程占25％，等于现在技术专科学校的课程；实习时间占23％，比现在的技术专科学校实习时间还多。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国教育文化相李一卿告诉我们，劳动党要求朝鲜的学校教育保证培养学生成为全面发展的社会主义、共产主义建设者。要全面发展政治思想教育、一般教育和技术教育。要继续贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，使学生不仅能够掌握所学的专门知识，还要有直接从事这方面劳动的技能。技术学校的课程安排，就是为了实现这样的目的。他说，不学好一般课程就不能学好技术课程，二者不能偏废。另一方面，也不能有技术至上思想，必须同时加强政治思想教育。
    把困难踩在脚下
    李一卿同志说，我们预想到进行这样一项大改革，必然会遇到许多困难。为了积累经验，1959年已经办了五百个技术学校，1960年可以招收初中毕业生二十多万人，约占全体初中毕业生的80％。
    目前所办的技术学校是专业技术学校，分别设立有关的专业技术课程。五百个技术学校共有一百一十五种不同的课程。另外还将分别办一些从小学阶段就开始的音乐、舞蹈、造型艺术等学校和招收初中毕业生的四年制体育学校。从1960年起停止招收一般高中学生，现有高中学生继续念到毕业，但要加强技术课程。教育制度改组后，大学仍照旧不变。1959年朝鲜新办了十五所大学，当时已经考虑到改变学制问题，因此办的都是技术大学。
    李一卿同志说，在实行技术义务教育的初期，首先遇到的困难是教员问题。我们调了一批过去技术专科学校的毕业生，由各大学分设师范科培养他们一年，就派他们到新办的技术学校教技术课。另外还调一批高中毕业生，进行一年师范教育，派到初中去教书，抽出初中原有的一部分优秀教员，派到技术学校教一般课程。这样做可能会使目前的教学质量降低，但是从长远看，这个问题很快就可以解决。另一个困难是学校的分布和学生宿舍问题。假定一个郡（县）有工、农、商等五个技术学校，都没有宿舍。学生走读的范围最远是三十里，如果某人想学工业，而附近只有农业学校，怎么办呢？要解决这个问题，最好是建设宿舍。但是，目前朝鲜的劳动力很缺乏，修建宿舍，配备厨师，都不是容易的事情。因此，我们暂时不许办寄宿学校，让各郡根据当地的经济发展需要，考虑技术学校的分布和课程问题，以便更好地适应目前的具体情况。同时，也发动群众自己想办法解决学生的住宿问题。
    李一卿同志说，我们就是这样在实践的过程中不断创造，不断革新。任何困难都阻挡不住我们的前进道路。我们有了正确的方向，一定能够创造条件，使朝鲜的教育制度日益完善。（会图片）
