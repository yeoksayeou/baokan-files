Fuzhou, January 20th (reported by this newspaper) - Xia浦 County, Fujian Province, fully leverages the superiority of the People's Commune, implements the policy of "prioritizing production, small scale, and commune management, prioritizing hydropower before hydroelectric power, combining hydropower and hydroelectric power, and combining indigenous and foreign methods," and launched a mass movement to vigorously develop hydropower construction. In just over two months, it built 190 hydropower stations and 4 power stations using different head differences, generating 35 kilowatts. Currently, the county is constructing another 245 hydropower stations.

Xia浦 County is surrounded by mountains and faces the sea, and every commune has abundant hydropower resources. However, before 1958, the entire county had only two old-fashioned watermills. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the Xizhai Brigade of the Shuimen Commune took the lead in building a hydropower station. The brigade had heavy farm work and a shortage of labor. With the help of the commune, they built an 8-horsepower hydropower station. Because small hydropower stations require less investment, are built quickly, and have high benefits, the Xizhai Brigade soon raised funds on its own to expand the original hydropower station to 28 horsepower, using it as power for grain processing, farm tool manufacturing, and tea rolling. This saved more than 50,000 workdays in eight months. In early September 1959, the county party committee summarized the experience of the Xizhai Brigade in building stations and considered that vigorously building hydropower and hydroelectric power stations to liberate labor was the key to promoting the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. It immediately organized cadres from various communes to hold an on-site meeting in the Xizhai Brigade, proposing to use indigenous methods, work hard for fifty days, and build seventy hydropower stations. Various communes immediately launched a mass movement to build hydropower stations on a large scale. Yangsha Brigade party branch secretary of the Chongru Commune personally led the masses to build stations using poor methods and indigenous methods. Without technicians, the brigade sent five carpenters to the Shuimen Commune to learn; if materials were insufficient, they insisted on using local materials and making full use of substitutes. In addition to buying large ball bearings for the water turbine, they used hardwood shafts instead of steel shafts, used white lime mixed with yellow soil instead of cement, used bamboo nails instead of iron nails, and self-made ball bearings with local steel. In this way, in just half a month, they made one water turbine, rice mill, threshing machine, potato cutter, feed chopper, and sawmill each, and built a 6-horsepower hydropower station, costing only more than 700 yuan, and it was put into production in one month. The Chongru Commune promoted the experience of the Yangsha Brigade, and built more than a dozen stations in just over forty days. The county party committee used the leadership method of taking the lead in one area to promote the construction of hydropower stations throughout the county more rapidly.

However, in the previous stage of the movement, most localities only utilized hydropower resources with larger head differences, and the hydropower of lower head and flat flow channels had not been well utilized. The county party committee believed that fully utilizing the hydropower of low head and flat flow channels was a key to better implementing the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy. Li Yue, the first secretary of the county party committee, worked with workers in the Dongguan Brigade of the Chengguan Commune to develop a low head water turbine. This type of water turbine has three major advantages: (1) Stations can be set up wherever there is water, and can be installed in a mobile manner. A head difference of seven inches to one foot can drive the water turbine; as long as a dam is built in a flat flow to create a head difference, it can also be installed. (2) The cost is low and the technology is easy. A carpenter can make one in three or four days. (3) It is highly efficient and easy to operate. When used for cutting potatoes, it can cut 7,000 to 15,000 catties in ten hours, which is eight to eighteen times more efficient than manual labor. After the county party committee organized more than 6,000 people to visit, the county built 121 stations in more than twenty days, which played a significant role in the autumn harvest and sweet potato processing.

Nanning, January 20th (reported by this newspaper) - Daxin County, Guangxi Province, implements the policy of "prioritizing production, small scale, and commune management" and vigorously develops hydropower stations. It has now built ninety-three hydropower stations, forty of which have been put into operation. Out of the county's twenty communes and three hundred and sixteen brigades, nineteen communes and two hundred and twenty-three brigades have used hydropower. These power stations drive forty-eight rice mills, two generators, fifteen circular saws, fifteen pulping machines, two water pumps, eight flour mills, and forty-five slicing and vine cutting machines every day, replacing manpower for work all day long. Although the winter planting area in 1959 was more than double that of 1958, due to the replenishment of labor, winter planting was completed on schedule, and more than twenty dan of base fertilizer was applied per mu than in previous years. At the same time, commune industries and sideline occupations have also accelerated their development.

The main experience of Daxin County in rapidly popularizing hydropower stations is the correct implementation of the policy of "prioritizing production, small scale, and commune management." The county party committee proposed that "regardless of the size of the water flow, as long as it can drive a threshing machine, a power station must be built." Under the guidance of this idea, the station construction work was carried out vigorously. The experience of this county proves that as long as there is 0.2 flow rate and a 1.5-meter head difference, a station can be built and a low-head propeller turbine can be installed.

Daxin County has a vast territory and a sparse population, and labor is very insufficient. Using hydropower energy to process agricultural and sideline products is an important method to save labor. After all ninety-three hydropower stations in Daxin County are fully utilized, 12,000 laborers can be saved, which has played a huge role in solving the problem of labor shortage.

However, views on the policy of "prioritizing production, small scale, and commune management" were not consistent at first. At the beginning of station construction, some cadres were willing to engage in large-scale projects but not small-scale ones, willing to engage in foreign projects but not indigenous ones, and willing to engage in power generation but not processing. After the county party committee discovered these problems, it immediately held an on-site meeting in Taocheng Commune, which had done a good job in small hydropower stations, so that everyone realized that building hydropower stations should not be divorced from reality and simply pursue large-scale and foreign projects. After the meeting, the station construction work was fully rolled out, and in less than a month, more than fifty small hydropower stations were built throughout the county. (Attached picture)

### 贯彻生产为主小型为主社办为主的方针  多建水力站　充分利用水能  福建霞浦县就地取材土法上马，广西大新县大小落差一齐利用

    贯彻生产为主小型为主社办为主的方针
    多建水力站　充分利用水能
    福建霞浦县就地取材土法上马，广西大新县大小落差一齐利用
    本报福州20日电　福建霞浦县充分发挥人民公社的优越性，贯彻以“生产为主、小型为主、社办为主，先水力后水电、水力水电并举、土洋并举”的方针，大搞水力动力建设的群众运动，两个多月利用不同落差建成水力站一百九十个、发电站四座，发电三十五瓩。目前这个县正在兴建的水力站还有二百四十五处。
    霞浦县靠山面海，社社都有丰富的水力资源。但在1958年以前，全县仅有两个旧式水磨。人民公社化后，水门公社溪宅大队首先开始建设水力站。这个队农活重，劳力少，在公社帮助下，他们建成了一处八马力的水力站。由于小型水力站投资省、建设快、效益大，不久溪宅大队又自筹资金，把原有水力站扩大为二十八马力，作为粮食加工、农具制造、揉茶的动力。八个月就节省五万多个劳动日。1959年9月初，县委总结了溪宅大队建站的经验，认为大力兴建水力、水电站解放劳力，是促进农林牧副渔生产全面发展的关键。随即组织了各公社干部在溪宅大队召开现场会议，提出土法上马，苦战五十天，建设七十个水力站。各公社立即开展了大建水力站的群众运动。崇儒公社杨沙大队党支部书记亲自领导群众，用穷办法、土办法建站。没有技工，大队派五个木匠到水门公社学习；材料不足，坚持就地取材，充分利用代用品，除买水轮机用的大珠套外，利用硬木轴代钢轴，用白灰混黄土代水泥，竹钉代铁钉，用土钢自制滚珠轴承。这样，仅半个月就制成水轮机、碾米机、脱谷机、切薯机、饲料切碎机、锯木机各一部，建成了一个六马力的水力站，只花了七百多元，一个月时间就投入生产。崇儒公社推广了杨沙大队的经验，只四十多天就建站十多个。县委通过以点带面的领导方法，使全县水力站的建设更迅速地展开。
    但是运动的前一阶段，各地一般只利用了落差较大的水力资源，更多的落差低、平流渠的水力还没有得到很好利用。县委认为充分利用落差低和平流渠的水力是更好地贯彻“小土群”方针的一个关键。县委第一书记李岳在城关公社东关大队和工人共同研究，制成了低落差水轮机。这种水轮机有三大优点：（1）可以逢水设站，流动安装，落差七寸至一尺就可以带动水轮机；平流水只要截坝造成落差也可以安装。（2）成本低，技术易，一个木工三、四天就能制一台。（3）功效高，操作容易，利用来切薯，十小时能切七千斤至一万五千斤，比人工提高八到十八倍。县委组织了六千多人参观后，全县二十多天就建了一百二十一个站，在秋收和番薯加工中起了很大作用。
    本报南宁20日电　广西大新县贯彻“生产为主，小型为主，社办为主”的方针，大办水力站。现已建成水力站九十三个，其中四十个已投入生产。全县二十个公社，三百一十六个大队，已有十九个公社、二百二十三个大队用上了水力动力。这些动力站每天带动着四十八台碾米机、两台发电机、十五台圆盘锯、十五台打浆机、两台水泵、八台磨粉机和四十五台切片切蔓机，代替人力整日做工。1959年冬种面积虽然比1958年扩大了一倍多，由于劳力得到补充，冬种按期完成，每亩比往年多下基肥二十多担。同时，公社工业和副业也加速发展起来。
    大新县水力站能够迅速遍地开花的主要经验，就是正确地贯彻了“生产为主、小型为主、社办为主”的方针。县委提出“不管水流大小、只要能带动一部打谷机，就要建立动力站”。在这种思想指导下，建站工作轰轰烈烈地搞起来。这个县的经验证明，只要有零点二个流量和一点五米的落差，就可以建站，安装低水头旋桨式水轮机。
    大新县地广人稀，劳动力十分不足，利用水力能源来加工农副产品，就是节约劳动力的一个重要方法。大新县的九十三个水力站全部运用起来以后，就可节省一万二千个劳动力，这对解决劳动力不足的问题起了巨大的作用。
    然而，对于“生产为主，小型为主，社办为主”方针的看法，最初并不都是一致的。在开始建站时，有些干部愿搞大的不愿搞小的，愿搞洋的不愿搞土的，愿搞发电不愿搞加工。县委发现这些问题以后，立即在小型水力动力站搞得好的桃城公社召开了现场会议，使大家认识搞水力站不能脱离实际地单纯求大求洋。会后，建站工作全面铺开，不到一个月的时间，全县就建成了小型水力站五十多处。（附图片）
