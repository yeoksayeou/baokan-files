Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 6th: It has been announced that in Indonesia, starting from the beginning of the year, gasoline prices have nearly doubled, electricity rates have increased by 40% to over 100%, and cigarette prices have risen by about 50%.

Indonesian Minister of Distribution, Leimena, in a statement to the press on the 4th, advised the Indonesian people to "once again adopt a calm attitude and maintain composure" in the face of rising prices for oil and other daily necessities. Foreign monopolistic oil companies in Indonesia, such as Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso) and Batavia Petroleum Company, have been demanding an increase in the prices of petroleum products produced in Indonesia. On the 2nd, the price of gasoline in Indonesia rose from 1.06 rupiah per liter to 2 rupiah. According to the Indonesian News Agency, in addition to the rise in gasoline prices, the price of kerosene used for fuel also increased by 66%, and the price of industrial diesel doubled.

Another important economic problem currently facing Indonesia is the continuous issuance of currency. According to a report from the Bank of Indonesia, the amount of currency in circulation had reached over 32.5 billion rupiah by the end of last week. After taking measures such as devaluing large denomination banknotes and other measures, the government recovered 8 to 10 billion rupiah. However, prices soared immediately after these measures were taken.

Newspapers point out that to solve economic difficulties, measures should be taken against imperialist monopoly capital.

    印度尼西亚一些物品价格上涨
    据新华社雅加达6日电　据宣布，在印度尼西亚，从年初起，汽油价格上涨了几乎一倍，电费上涨40％到一倍以上，香烟涨价50％左右。
    印度尼西亚分配部长莱梅纳4日在向报界谈话时劝告印度尼西亚人民在石油和其他日用必需品涨价的情况下“再次采取镇静态度，而且保持镇静”。在印度尼西亚的美孚油公司和巴达维亚石油公司等外国垄断石油公司一直要求提高在印度尼西亚出产的石油产品的价格。2日，印度尼西亚的汽油价格从一公升一点零六盾涨到二盾。据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，除了汽油涨价而外，作燃料用的煤油的价格也上涨了66％，工业用柴油上涨了一倍。
    目前印度尼西亚经济方面的另一个重要问题是不断增发通货的问题。据印度尼西亚银行的报告，货币流通量到上周末已达三百二十五亿余盾。在采取了大票面纸币贬值的措施和其他措施后，政府收回了八十亿至一百亿盾。但是，在采取这些措施后，物价接着就飞涨。
    报纸指出，要解决经济困难，应当对帝国主义垄断资本采取措施。
