Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 28th — The Spring Festival慰问团 (comfort group) from all circles in Tibet held a grand meeting in Lhasa on the 27th to extend greetings to the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa.

    阿沛·阿旺晋美, Deputy Head of the General Delegation of the慰问团, warmly expressed his cordial greetings and respect to the PLA troops stationed in Tibet at the meeting. He said: The PLA troops stationed in Tibet have made immortal contributions to the motherland and the Tibetan people. This army of the people of all ethnic groups has won the love of the Tibetan people with its exemplary actions.

    阿沛·阿旺晋美 said: 1959 was a year in which the situation in Tibet underwent fundamental changes. When the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary group launched an armed rebellion, the PLA suppression troops, with the vigorous support of the Tibetan people, bravely and resolutely quelled the rebellion quickly, which not only greatly strengthened the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities, and paved the way for democratic reforms in Tibet, but also further consolidated the border defense of the motherland and safeguarded the completeness of national territorial sovereignty. In his speech, he also highly praised the great achievements made by the troops stationed in Tibet in participating in various tasks in Tibet.

    Then, 阿沛·阿旺晋美 presented a banner to the troops stationed in Tibet on behalf of the慰问团. 少将 詹化雨, Deputy Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, accepted the banner on behalf of all officers and soldiers and expressed his determination to strive for the construction of a prosperous, strong, and happy new Tibet on the basis of last year's great victory.

    At the meeting, women and students from Lhasa performed literary and artistic programs such as "Labor Dance" and "菩萨兵 (Bodhisattva Soldiers)." These programs enthusiastically praised the happy life of the Tibetan people after gaining new life and the heroic deeds of the PLA in fighting bravely and loving the people.

    热爱各族人民的子弟兵
    拉萨开大会　慰问解放军
    据新华社拉萨28日电　西藏地区各界人民春节慰问团，27日在拉萨举行大会，慰问人民解放军驻拉萨部队。
    慰问团总团副团长阿沛·阿旺晋美在会上热情地向解放军驻西藏部队表示亲切的慰问和敬意。他说：解放军驻西藏部队为祖国和西藏人民立下了不朽的功勋。这支各族人民的子弟兵，以自己的模范行动，获得了西藏人民的爱戴。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说：1959年是西藏地区形势发生根本变化的一年。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动武装叛乱时，解放军平叛部队在西藏人民大力支援下，英勇顽强，迅速平定了叛乱，这不仅大大地加强了祖国的统一和民族的团结，为西藏地区的民主改革铺平了道路，而且进一步巩固了祖国的边防，维护了国家领土主权的完整。在讲话中，他还盛赞驻藏部队在参加西藏地区各项工作中所作出的丰功伟绩。
    接着，阿沛·阿旺晋美代表慰问团向驻藏部队赠旗，西藏军区副政治委员詹化雨少将接受锦旗后，代表全体官兵表示：决心在去年伟大胜利的基础上，为建设繁荣、富强、幸福的新西藏而奋斗。
    会上，拉萨市妇女、学生等演出了“劳动舞”和“菩萨兵”等文艺节目。这些节目都热情洋溢地歌颂了西藏人民获得新生后的愉快生活和解放军英勇斗争，热爱人民的英雄事迹。
