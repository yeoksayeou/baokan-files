Harbin Expands "Ring Network Power Supply" Scope
South Malu Area Experiment Results: More power supply, less loss, both rational and safe, greatly saving electrical equipment.
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, January 13th) On the basis of promoting the experience of "simplifying, raising voltage, and ring network power supply," the Harbin Electric Wire Factory recently formed a ring network power supply system with factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, and street residents in the South Malu area near the factory site. This fundamentally reversed the old practice of each enterprise unit having its own set of power equipment, and achieved "four unifications" in power supply (unifying power and lighting, unifying public and civilian use, unifying large and small factories, unifying the internal power grid and the public power grid), which not only improved power supply capacity, ensured more supply with less loss, and was rational and safe, but also saved a large amount of electrical equipment.
    The South Malu area in Harbin covers an area of more than 910,000 square meters, including more than 30 factories and enterprises, as well as some government offices, schools, shops, and street residents. Originally, some of the larger factories and enterprises in this area had their own dedicated power lines and transformers; the production or lighting electricity for some of the smaller factories and enterprises, government offices, schools, shops, and street residents, etc., had another set of public power lines and public transformers. According to statistics, there were as many as 19 transmission lines alone; a total of 80 transformers; and 18 substations. This decentralized power supply method not only brought many difficulties to line maintenance work, but also, because there was no connection between public and private transmission lines, or between the private transmission lines of various enterprises, the result was that some factories and enterprises had surplus power, while others were affected in their production due to insufficient power, and because the voltage was not uniform, they could not support each other.
    Now, the "four unifications" ring network power supply is implemented in the South Malu area, fundamentally changing this unreasonable and uneconomical phenomenon, breaking down the boundaries between units in power supply, and achieving centralized power supply and decentralized use.
    This "four unifications" ring network power supply system takes the Harbin Electric Wire Factory as the center, and the current generated by the power plant is transmitted through underground cables to the central substation located in the Electric Wire Factory. After being transformed, the current is transmitted through underground cables to two central substations located in two other factories. The two central substations transform the high-voltage power supplied from the central substation into low-voltage power, and then directly supply it to nearby factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, and the homes of street residents. The reform of the power distribution system in the South Malu area involves: reducing or merging equipment that can be reduced or merged in the power distribution system of the South Malu area as much as possible, in order to reduce power loss and save materials; increasing the voltage on the condition of fully utilizing the original equipment, raising the lighting power supply from 110 volts to 220 volts, and raising the production power supply from 220 volts to 380 volts, in order to reduce voltage levels and simplify the power distribution system; at the same time, connecting the internal power supply lines into a ring, so that the power supply lines and substations of all factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, and street residents in the entire area are connected together, so that each unit can mutually support each other in terms of electricity use; and when a line or a substation fails, it can still be powered by a backup safety line, making it safer and more reliable.
    After the power distribution system was reformed in this way, the number of transmission lines in the South Malu area was reduced from 19 to 6, the number of transformers was reduced from 80 to 36, and the number of substations was also reduced from 18 to 12. At the same time, the equipment was also greatly simplified. The dismantled electrical equipment alone included 30,000 meters of various metal wires, 85 electric poles, 870 high-voltage porcelain bottles, and 17 sets of high-voltage distribution panels, with a total value of 368,000 yuan. At the same time, due to the rational power supply method, this area also tapped more than 4,500 kilowatts of power potential, solving the problem of insufficient power supply for some factories. Moreover, after the voltage was increased, the transmission capacity was improved, the speed of the machines increased, and the lights were brighter. Therefore, the factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, and street residents and other power users were very satisfied.

### 哈尔滨“环形供电”范围扩大

    动力用电与照明用电合一　公用电与民用电合一
    大厂用电与小厂用电合一　厂内电网与公用电网合一
    哈尔滨“环形供电”范围扩大
    南马路地区试行结果：供电多、损失少、既合理又安全，电气设备大大节省
    本报哈尔滨13日电　哈尔滨电线厂在推行“简化、升压、环形供电”经验的基础上，最近又与厂址附近南马路地区各工厂企业、机关学校和街道居民共同组成环形供电系统。这样就从根本上扭转了原来每个企业单位各搞一套用电设备的老做法，在电力供应上做到了“四合一”（动力与照明合一、公用与民用合一、大厂与小厂合一、厂内电网与公用电网合一），既提高了供电能力，保证多供少损、合理安全，又节省了大量的电气设备。
    哈尔滨南马路地区方圆有九十一万多平方米的地区内，包括有三十多个工厂企业和一部分机关、学校、商店及街道居民。原来，这地区内一些较大的工厂企业都各设有专用电线和专用变压器；一些较小的工厂企业和机关、学校、商店及街道居民等的生产或照明用电，又另设有一套公用电线和公用变压器。据统计：其中光是输电线路就多至十九趟；变压器共有八十台；变电所有十八座。这种分散的供电方式，不仅给线路维护工作带来许多困难，且因公用输电线路和专用输电线路之间，各企业各专用输电线路之间又互不联系；结果，往往一部分工厂企业电力有余，另部分工厂因电力不足已影响生产，由于电压不统一，却不能互相支援。
    现在南马路地区实行“四合一”环形供电，从根本上改变了这种不合理、不经济的现象，在电力供应上打破单位之间的界限，做到集中供电，分散使用。
    这个“四合一”环形供电系统是以哈尔滨电线厂为中心，将发电厂发出的电流通过地下电缆，先输送到设在电线厂的中央变电所，经过变压，再通过地下电缆将电流输送到设在另外两个工厂的两个中心变电所。两个中心变电所把从中央变电所输送来的高压电源变成低压后，再直接输送到它附近的工厂企业、机关、学校和街道居民家中。南马路地区的配电系统的改革内容是：把南马路地区配电系统中可以减去或合并的设备，尽量减去或合并，以减少电力损耗，节省器材；在充分利用原有设备的条件下提高电压，将照明由一百一十伏供电升高到二百二十伏，生产用电由二百二十伏电压升高到三百八十伏，以减少电压等级，简化配电系统；同时把内供电线路接成环形，使整个地区内各工厂企业、机关、学校、街道居民的供电线路和变电所都连成一起，使各单位在用电上可以互通有无；而当一条线路或一个变电所发生故障时，仍可由备用的保安线路供电，做到更安全可靠。
    经过配电系统这样改以后，南马路地区内的输电线路电由十九趟减少到六趟，变压器由八十台减少到三十六台，变电所也由十八座减少到十二座。同时，设备也大大简化了，光拆下来的电气器材就有各种金属导线三万米、电柱八十五根、高压瓷瓶八百七十个、高压配电盘十七套，总值达三十六万八千多元。同时，由于供电方式合理，这个地区还挖掘出四千五百多瓩的电力潜力，解决了部分工厂电源不足的问题。而且在电压升高以后，输电能力提高了，机器转数更加快，电灯更明亮，因此，工厂企业、机关、学校和街道居民等用电单位都很满意。
