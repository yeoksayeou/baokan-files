Need More Ma Xueli
    Jing Yu
    In early December of last year, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision to call on all workers in the province to launch a campaign to learn from Ma Xueli. Now, this campaign is developing wave upon wave, and more and more people are living and fighting according to Ma Xueli's thoughts and style.
    Who is Ma Xueli? Why are so many people following him to learn? Please see the masses' praise for him: "Believe in the masses, believe in the Party, be bold in innovation, and have courage. Step up when you see difficulties, give way when you see honors, learn when you see advanced, and help when you see backward." This song of praise from the masses vividly and accurately portrays the spirit of this person. Everyone loves him and admires him. Therefore, they are determined to learn from him and be a person who is not afraid of difficulties, does not care about honor, strives for the top, is selfless, and works selflessly and fights tirelessly for the lofty ideal of communism.
    "Step up when you see difficulties" reflects the true nature of the heroes of our time. On the road of technological innovation, people will always encounter various difficulties. What to do when faced with all kinds of difficulties! Is it to step up or step down, to advance or retreat? This determines the success or failure of the cause. "Step up when you see difficulties" may lead to success, but step down when you see difficulties, then it will be difficult to move forward and it will be difficult to avoid failure. In the eyes of revolutionaries, the first thing to do when dealing with difficulties is to have the revolutionary spirit of advancing in the face of difficulties. We must never be cowards who retreat in the face of difficulties. Difficulties are like springs, the weaker you are, the stronger they become. Throughout history, thousands of revolutionary heroes have grown up by dealing with difficulties countless times and overcoming difficulties countless times. The heroic achievements in construction are of course no exception.
    "Give way when you see honors" reflects the great mind of the heroes of the times. Our time is the time of collectivism. The achievements of any hero are inseparable from the strength and wisdom of the collective. Ma Xueli deeply understands this, so when people ask him: "How many innovation suggestions have you made?" He said, "I really can't answer, because I never thought which one was my personal thing." This spirit of "giving way when you see honors" is an excellent quality of the working class. Honors are given by the Party and the masses, not won by individuals. However, when an individual receives honors, he should also see that this honor belongs to our great Party and people.
    "Learn when you see advanced" reflects the enterprising spirit of the heroes of our time. There is no end to creation and learning. The most valuable quality of all advanced people lies in creative labor and hard study. We are believers in continuous revolution. In order to realize the great ideal of the proletariat, we always climb from one peak to another. We can never be satisfied.
    "Help when you see backward" reflects the selfless spirit of the heroes of our time. One person's creation is always limited. A single flower does not make spring, but a hundred flowers in full bloom make spring. Therefore, all advanced elements have an unshirkable responsibility to the backward elements, which is to "help". Help them boost their energy, help them open up their minds, help them overcome difficulties, and help them make progress together.
    Comrade Ma Xueli is not an extraordinary hero. The most fundamental reason why he can make unique contributions is that under the education of the Party, he listens to the Party's words. Wherever the Party points, he rushes there, and uses all his energy to solve the problems pointed out by the Party. It is precisely because he can rely on the masses and the Party that he has the strength and courage to dare to boldly innovate and create various new tools, and that he can grow into a person with a lofty style who does not regard himself as a hero.
    In the torrent of the Great Leap Forward for two consecutive years, countless heroic figures have emerged on our various fronts. Ma Xueli is one of the countless heroes. For a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960, we need more heroic figures, and we need more people to work like Ma Xueli. The Hubei Province's campaign to learn from Ma Xueli will surely vigorously promote the continuous upsurge of the mass technological innovation wave.

    需要更多的马学礼
    静宇
    去年12月上旬，中共湖北省委作出了一项决定，号召全省职工开展学习马学礼运动，现在，这个运动正在一浪高一浪的向前发展，愈来愈多的人正在按照马学礼的思想、风格而生活而战斗。
    马学礼是什么人？为什么那么多人跟着他学习？请看群众给他的赞歌：“相信群众相信党，大胆革新有胆量。见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮。”这支来自群众的赞歌，朴素而准确地刻画了这个人的精神面貌。大家喜爱他，景仰他。因而决心向他学习，做一个不怕困难、不计荣誉、力争上游、大公无私，为共产主义的崇高理想而忘我劳动、战斗不懈的人。
    “见困难就上”，反映了我们时代英雄的本色。在技术革新的道路上，人们总是会碰到这样、那样的困难的。各种困难摆在面前，怎么办！是上，还是下，是前进，还是后退，这决定着事业的成功和失败。“见困难就上”，就有可能成功，见困难就下，那就寸步难行，难免失败。在革命者看来，对待困难首先要有知难而进的革命气魄。绝不能做知难而退的懦夫。困难像弹簧，你弱它就强。历史上千千万万革命英雄，都是同困难打了无数次交道，战胜了无数次困难而成长起来的。建设中的英雄业迹当然也不能例外。
    “见荣誉就让”，反映了时代英雄的伟大胸襟，我们的时代是集体主义的时代，任何英雄人物的成就都是和集体的力量、集体的智慧分不开的。马学礼深深地懂得这一点，所以，当人们问他：“你究竟有了多少革新建议？”他说，“我实在答不出来，因为我没有想到哪是我个人的东西。”这种“见荣誉就让”的精神，是工人阶级的优秀品质。荣誉是党和群众给予的，不是个人争来的，然而当个人获得荣誉的时候，又应该看到这种荣誉是属于我们伟大的党和人民的。
    “见先进就学”，反映了我们时代英雄的进取精神。创造和学习是永远没有止境的。一切先进人物最可贵的品质就在于创造性的劳动，刻苦地学习。我们是不断革命论者，为了实现无产阶级的伟大理想，我们总是从一个高峰登上另一个高峰。永远也不能满足。
    “见后进就帮”，反映了我们的时代英雄大公无私的精神。一个人的创造总是有限的，一花独放不是春，万紫千红才是春。所以，一切先进分子对于后进分子有一个义不容辞的职责，就是一个“帮”字。帮助他们鼓足干劲，帮助他们打通思想，帮助他们克服困难，帮助他们共同进步。
    马学礼同志并不是异乎常人的英雄，他之所以能有独特的贡献，最根本的一条就是在党的教养下，听党的话。党指向哪里，他就奔向哪里，把全副精力用来解决党所指出的问题。正因为他能够做到依靠群众依靠党，他才有了力量和勇气敢于大胆革新，创制各种新的工具，他才有可能成长为不以英雄自居的崇高风格的人。
    在连续两年大跃进的洪流里，我们各个战线上出现了无数的英雄人物，马学礼是无数英雄中的一个，为了1960年的更好更全面的跃进，我们需要更多的英雄人物，需要更多的人照马学礼那样干活。湖北省的学习马学礼运动，必将有力地促进群众性的技术革新浪潮不断高涨。
