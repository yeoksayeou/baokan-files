    Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: This afternoon, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a forum to warmly celebrate the great victory of the successful launch of a multi-stage ballistic missile by the Soviet Union. Present were leading members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, leading members of various democratic parties, famous scientists in the capital, and other well-known figures from all walks of life.
    The forum was presided over by Guo Moruo, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. At the beginning of the forum, he said that the Soviet rocket hitting the designated area of the Pacific Ocean once again convincingly showed that Soviet science and technology have already been at the forefront of the world, far ahead, forming the sharpest contrast with the American-launched "Yam."
    He said that the high-speed development of Soviet science and technology demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The successful launch of the Soviet rocket has made peace-loving people rejoice and greatly shocked the imperialist war-mongers. It has strengthened the confidence of mankind in defending peace, increased the contradictions between the imperialists, and is a serious blow to the American ruling clique's policy of preparing for war in the name of peace. Guo Moruo said with enthusiasm that the successful launch of the new Soviet rocket is a major event concerning all mankind. This is a rocket of peace, a rocket of human happiness. We express our warm congratulations to the Soviet scientists and the Soviet people for their achievements.
    The scientists at the meeting highly evaluated the major scientific achievements of the new Soviet rocket. Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that this Soviet rocket, aimed at launching larger heavy Earth satellites and preparing for space flight, has two issues that particularly interest scientists: First, the thrust of this rocket has reached about one million pounds, while the Atlas missile boasted by the United States has a thrust of only 360,000 pounds; Second, the range of this Soviet rocket has reached more than 12,000 kilometers, which means that the speed per second has reached more than seven kilometers, which is close to the first cosmic velocity. All of this indicates that Soviet science has far outstripped the United States, fully demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.
    Qian Xuesen, a specialist in mechanics, spoke in detail about the major scientific achievements of the new Soviet rocket. He said that the rocket launched by the Soviet Union to the Pacific region is a rocket of peace, and it has far exceeded the range of intercontinental missiles, because intercontinental missiles do not need such powerful rockets at all. The new rocket launched by the Soviet Union this time is precisely for the purpose of conquering the universe, exploring outer space, and serving peace. Hua Luogeng, a mathematician, said that the successful launch of a multi-stage ballistic missile by the Soviet Union into the Pacific Ocean once again shows that Soviet science has reached an unprecedented peak in the world, and it can be predicted that the time when mankind leaves the earth to fly into space is not far away. Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that this major victory of Soviet science and technology at the beginning of the 1960s will become the beginning of mankind's use of interplanetary observation stations to study Venus and Mars, and will also open up a broad path for mankind to fly into space. Cheng Maolan, an astronomer, said that the new rocket launched by the Soviet Union this time has opened up a great road for the study of solar system planets, making it possible for mankind to jump out of the scope of the earth for the first time and explore a wider universe.
    Many people emphasized in their speeches the great significance of the Soviet Union's launch of new rockets in combating war-mongers and maintaining world peace. Huang Yanpei, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said that the Soviet Union launched the new rocket the day after the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which was a warning to U.S. imperialism. Li Dequan, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said that the high accuracy of the Soviet rocket has shocked the world. This is a new victory for the Soviet Communist Party, the government, and the people, and also a new victory for the socialist camp and all peace-loving people in the world. Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said that the Soviet Union successfully launched a powerful multi-stage ballistic missile the day after the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which was a serious blow to the war-mongers. Liu Qingyang, Vice President of the All-China Women's Federation, said that the successful launch of the new Soviet rocket is another proof that "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind," and another major contribution to world peace. Li Zhuchen, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said in a written speech that if imperialism continues to play the power politics game, and even launches a war recklessly, it can only be doomed to its own destruction in the end, and there can be no other result.
    Guo Moruo finally emphasized once again that the victory of the Soviet scientific cause fully proves the greatness and correctness of the Communist Party's leadership. He called on all scientific workers to loyally accept the Party's leadership, work hard, and be a docile tool of the Party, and never fail to live up to the Party's expectations of scientific workers.

    和平的火箭　幸福的火箭
    首都各界人士集会座谈苏联新火箭的重大成就
    据新华社22日讯　今天下午，中国科学院和中苏友好协会总会联合举行了座谈会，热烈庆贺苏联发射多级弹道火箭成功的伟大胜利。到会的有中苏友好协会总会的负责人，各民主党派的负责人，首都著名的科学家，以及其他各界著名人士。
    座谈会由中苏友好协会总会副会长、中国科学院院长郭沫若主持。他在座谈会开始的时候讲话说，苏联火箭射到太平洋预定海域，再一次令人信服地显示了苏联科学技术已经走在世界的最前列，遥遥领先，同美国发射的“山药蛋”形成了最鲜明的对照。
    他说，苏联科学技术的高速度发展，显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。苏联火箭的发射成功，使爱好和平的人民欢欣鼓舞，使帝国主义战争贩子大为震惊，它增强了人类保卫和平的信心，增加了帝国主义者之间的矛盾，对美国统治集团以和平为名、行备战之实的政策是一个严重的打击。郭沫若热情洋溢地说，苏联发射新火箭成功，是一件有关全人类的大事，这是和平的火箭，人类幸福的火箭，我们对苏联科学家和苏联人民的成就，表示热烈的祝贺。
    科学家们在会上高度地评价了苏联新火箭在科学上的重大成就。中国科学院副院长吴有训说，苏联这次旨在为发射更大的重型地球卫星和为宇宙飞行作准备的火箭，有两个问题特别引起科学家们的兴趣；第一、这次火箭的推力已达到一百万磅左右，而美国所吹嘘的阿特拉斯导弹推力才不过三十六万磅；第二、苏联这次火箭射程达到一万二千多公里，这就是说一秒钟的速度达到七公里以上，已经接近第一宇宙速度。这一切，都表示苏联科学已远远走在美国的前面，充分显示出社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    力学家钱学森详细地谈到了苏联新火箭在科学上的重大成就，他说，苏联向太平洋地区发射的火箭，是和平的火箭，它已远远超出洲际导弹，因为洲际导弹根本不需要这样强大的火箭。苏联这次发射的新火箭，正是为了征服宇宙，探测宇宙空间，为和平服务的。数学家华罗庚说，苏联向太平洋海域发射多级弹道火箭的成功，又一次说明了苏联科学达到了世界上空前未有的高峰，可以预料人类离开地球飞向太空已经为期不远了。中国科学院副院长竺可桢说，在二十世纪六十年代开始的时候这一苏联科学技术的重大胜利，将成为人类用行星际观测站来研究金星和火星的开端，也为人类飞向太空开辟了广阔的道路。天文学家程茂兰说，苏联这次发射的新火箭更为研究太阳系行星开辟了一条大道，使人类第一次有可能跳出地球的范围，去探索更广阔的宇宙空间。
    许多人在发言中强调苏联发射新火箭对打击战争贩子、维护世界和平的重大意义。中苏友好协会总会副会长、中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培说，苏联这次发射新火箭，正是美日军事同盟条约签订的第二天，这是对美帝国主义的一次警告。中苏友好协会总会副会长李德全说，苏联火箭高度的准确性，震动了全世界，这是苏联共产党、政府和人民的新胜利，也是社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的新胜利。九三学社主席许德珩说，在美日军事同盟条约签订的第二天，苏联成功地发射了威力强大的多级弹道火箭，这是对战争贩子的严重打击。全国妇联副主席刘清扬说，苏联新火箭的发射成功，是“东风压倒西风”的又一次证明，是对世界和平的又一次重大贡献。中苏友好协会总会副会长李烛尘发表书面讲话说，帝国主义如果继续玩弄实力政策，甚至悍然发动战争，除了注定最后自取灭亡以外，不可能有别的结果。
    郭沫若最后再一次强调说，苏联科学事业的胜利，完全证明了共产党领导的伟大和正确，他号召全体科学工作者，一定要忠诚地接受党的领导，努力工作，作党的驯服工具，绝不要辜负党对科学工作者的期待。
