    (Reported by our correspondent Wang Dazhi) During the Great Leap Forward in production in 1959, the Yiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province adhered to the leadership methods of on-site visits, major inspections, and major appraisals. Based on the new situation, new developments were made in specific practices.
    How to make inspections and appraisals regular and systematic, making them a driving force for continuously advancing the production competition movement, was a primary issue the Yiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party encountered when it began organizing inspections and appraisals last year. After research, they adopted the method of formulating inspection and appraisal outlines, that is, issuing outlines before inspections and appraisals, and formulating outlines for the next inspection and appraisal during the previous inspection and appraisal. The outlines clearly stipulated the content of the inspection and appraisal, and the new competition goals for the next stage. The outlines became more advanced each time, and the competition developed continuously. At the same time, the outlines fully reflected the County Committee's intentions at various stages, ensuring that the competition movement could develop on a normal track. Last February, when a manure accumulation campaign was launched, the County Committee made manure accumulation an important element, stipulating it within the outline for the first inspection and appraisal. At that time, Xinshidu Commune accumulated the most fertilizer, reaching 450 dan per mu, while the county average was only 200 dan per mu. After discovering this, the County Committee immediately convened an on-site meeting attended by over 1,000 cadres, summarizing and promoting Xinshidu's experience in extensively reforming manure accumulation tools, while formulating the second appraisal condition, which focused on inspecting progress. More than ten days later, by the time of the second inspection and appraisal, the county's fertilizer had surged from 200 dan per mu to 510 dan per mu. However, the inspection and appraisal revealed that some fertilizers were of poor quality, and half of the fertilizer had not been transported to the fields. Therefore, when formulating the third inspection and appraisal outline, quality was emphasized, and it was stipulated that fertilizer not transported to the fields would not be included in the appraisal. After this outline was formulated, various localities further rationally arranged labor, dividing into three routes to accumulate, transport, and produce fertilizer, quickly launching a high tide of large-scale accumulation, transport, and production. After a month, by the time of the third inspection and appraisal, the amount of fertilizer per mu in the county had increased from over 500 dan to 700 dan, 84% of the fertilizer had been transported to the fields, and 76% had reached the standard of high quality.
    With the development of the appraisal competition, new problems also continued to arise. Each time a new problem arose, the County Committee could adopt flexible measures based on different situations to solve it in a timely manner. For example, after four or five inspection and appraisal competitions, some communes with good natural conditions and a good work foundation often won red flags, generating complacency; some areas with poor natural conditions and a poor work foundation were repeatedly ranked at the bottom, generating negative and disappointed emotions, affecting the further development of the competition. Changchun Commune is located in a plain area and has a good work foundation. When this commune competed with Yingfengqiao Commune, which has a poor work foundation, it won the red flag four times out of five appraisals, and some cadres became complacent. Some cadres in Yingfengqiao Commune felt a lot of pressure and lacked confidence. After discovering this situation, the County Committee not only educated the relevant cadres, but also readjusted the competition zones based on the actual situation. The original appraisal zones were mainly divided based on geographical proximity and ease of convening. After the adjustment, both natural conditions and the specific circumstances of both parties were taken into account, and communes with roughly the same work foundation were used as appraisal zones. For communes lagging behind in their work, the County Committee also provided special support in terms of funds and fertilizer, and sent cadres to provide specific assistance. In this way, a newer situation emerged in the county's appraisal competition. For example, after Changchun Commune was placed in an appraisal zone with Shatou and Lanxi communes in the lake area, the cadres and masses of this commune immediately became nervous. On the night of the adjustment of the appraisal zones, they successively convened Party committee meetings and cadre meetings, unanimously feeling that if they did not work hard in the competition with Shatou Commune, they would fall behind. After discussion, they put forward the slogan "Compete with Shatou in Enthusiasm, Skillful Work, Income, and Output," and mobilized the masses to increase effort and measures. More than 10,000 mu of early rice, which was growing very well and not intended to be top-dressed, was top-dressed again. Yingfengqiao Commune was greatly encouraged after the appraisal zones were adjusted. The commune convened a rally of more than 2,000 people, putting forward the slogan of eliminating third-class seedlings and reversing the backward situation in ten days. Subsequently, the entire commune mobilized more than 14,000 members, simultaneously accumulating fertilizer and top-dressing, and in ten days, all the fields were universally top-dressed twice, and more than 3,000 mu of the 5,000 mu of third-class seedlings were upgraded to second-class, and the work surged forward. Since then, the work of this commune has become increasingly proactive, becoming a prominent red flag in the county.
    Yiyang County also combined comprehensive inspection and appraisal with departmental inspection and appraisal, effectively mobilizing the positive factors of all fronts and timely supporting agricultural production. In each inspection and appraisal, the heads of industrial and transportation, commercial and trade, cultural and educational, and welfare fronts were invited to participate, so that they could understand the specific requirements put forward by the central work for them, and better serve production. For example, in the first inspection and appraisal, it was found that there was insufficient funding below, and that production materials such as lime, fertilizer, and agricultural tools were also relatively scarce, affecting production. After the responsible cadres of the financial and trade system attended the meeting, they immediately concentrated 60% of the cadres on this front to help the communes with cash income. In just one month, more than 40 new sideline occupations were opened up, and more than 1.84 million yuan in cash was retrieved. Coupled with the original savings of the communes, the funding needs were basically solved. At the same time, the industrial and transportation departments actively organized the processing of agricultural tools and the transportation of materials, ensuring timely supply. This not only met the needs of agricultural production in a timely manner, but also promoted the development of various departments.
    Through practice over the past year, the Yiyang County Committee has further realized the tremendous driving role of on-site visits, major inspections, and major appraisals in the revolutionary mass movement. Now, they are studying and taking measures to enrich the content of inspections and appraisals in order to promote continued leaps forward this year.

    益阳检查评比制度有新发展
    根据实际情况划分并调整评比竞赛区推动生产步步高升
    吸收工交和财贸等部门参加评比促进各条战线全面跃进
    本报讯　记者王达智报道：中共湖南省益阳县委在1959年的生产大跃进中，坚持运用了现场参观、大检查、大评比的领导方法。并根据新的情况，在具体做法上有了新的发展。
    如何把检查评比经常化、制度化，使之成为促进生产竞赛运动不断前进的一种动力，是中共益阳县委在去年开始组织检查评比时，首先遇到的一个问题。经过研究，他们采取了制订检查评比提纲的办法、即：在检查评比之前先发提纲，在上一次检查评比中，又制订了下一次的检查评比提纲。提纲中明确规定检查评比的内容，和下一段新的竞赛目标。提纲一次比一次先进，竞赛也连续不断地向前发展。同时，提纲中充分体现了县委在各个时期的意图，保证了竞赛运动能够在正常的轨道上发展。去年2月，当开展积肥运动时，县委就把积肥作为重要的内容，规定在第一次检查评比的提纲内。当时，新市渡公社的肥料积得最多，每亩田达四百五十担，而全县平均每亩只有二百担。县委发现后，立即召开了有一千多干部参加的现场会，总结推广了新市渡大搞积肥工具改革的经验，同时制订了第二次以检查进度为主的评比条件。十多天以后，到第二次检查评比时，全县肥料便由每亩二百担骤增到五百一十担。但在检查评比中，又发现有些肥料质量不好，同时还有一半肥料没有运到田中。于是，在制订第三次检查评比提纲时，就强调了质量，同时规定没有运到田中的肥料，在评比时不计算在内。这个提纲制订后，各地都进一步合理安排了劳力，分积肥、运肥、制肥三路进军，很快掀起了一个大积、大运、大制的竞赛高潮。经过一个月，第三次检查评比时，全县每亩田的肥料数量，已由五百多担增到七百担，84％的肥料运到了田里，76％达到了优质标准。
    随着评比竞赛的开展，新的问题也不断产生。每一次新的问题产生后，县委都能根据不同情况，采取灵活措施，及时解决。例如经过四、五次检查评比竞赛后，有些自然条件好、工作基础好的公社常得红旗，产生了骄傲自满情绪；有些自然条件和工作基础差的地区，屡次挂在末名，产生了消极失望情绪，影响了竞赛的进一步开展。长春公社地处平原区，工作基础好。这个社在和工作基础差的迎风桥公社竞赛时，五次评比，四次获得红旗，有些干部就产生了自满情绪。而迎风桥公社部分干部则感到压力很大，缺乏信心。县委发现这一情况后，除对有关干部进行教育外，也根据实际情况，重新调整了竞赛区。原来的评比区主要是根据地域毗邻，便于召集的条件划分的。调整后，既照顾了自然条件，也考虑到双方的具体情况，把工作基础大体一样的社作为评比区。对工作后进的公社，县委在资金、肥料等方面，还给予特别的支持，并派出干部，予以具体帮助。这样，全县的评比竞赛，便出现了一个更新的局面。比如把长春公社和湖区的沙头、兰溪等公社划为一个评比区后，这个公社的干部和群众顿时紧张起来了。在调整评比区的当晚，他们就连续召开了党委会和干部会，一致感到与沙头公社赛，如果不努力，就会掉在人家马下。经过讨论，他们提出了“干劲、巧干、收入、产量四赛沙头”的口号，发动群众加干劲加措施。原来长得很好不打算追肥的一万多亩早稻，又追了一次肥，迎风桥公社在调整评比区后，精神大振。公社召开了两千多人的誓师大会，提出十天消灭三类苗扭转后进局面的口号。接着，全社出动了一万四千多个社员，边积肥、边追肥，十天时间，所有的田普遍追肥两次，五千多亩三类苗，有三千多亩升为二类，工作一鼓就上来了。自此以后，这个社的工作节节主动，成了全县一面突出的红旗。
    益阳县还把全面检查评比和分线检查评比结合起来，有效地调动了各条战线的积极因素，及时支援了农业生产。在每次检查评比中，都吸收工交、财贸、文教、福利各条战线的负责人参加，使之了解中心工作对他们提出的具体要求，更好地为生产服务。如在第一次检查评比中，发现下面资金不足，石灰、肥料、农具等生产资料，也比较缺乏，影响了生产。财贸系统的负责干部参加会议后，立即集中本战线60％的干部，帮助各公社搞现金收入。仅一个月时间，新开辟副业门路四十多种，抓回现金一百八十四万多元。加上各公社原有储金，基本上解决了资金需要。同一时候，工交部门又积极组织了农具加工和物资调运，及时保证了供应。这不但及时满足了农业生产的需要，同时促进了各部门业务的开展。
    通过一年来的实践，使益阳县委进一步体会到现场参观、大检查、大评比，对革命群众运动的巨大推动作用。现在，他们正在研究并采取措施，来充实检查评比的内容，以促进今年的继续跃进。
