Xinhua News Agency, January 28th: During the Spring Festival, officers and soldiers of all services and arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, from generals to soldiers, gathered together to celebrate the festival. The various military cultural troupes, soldiers' performance teams, officers' choirs, and others also put on a great variety of artistic programs, filling the entire army with singing and dancing, celebrating the New Year.

    In the Beijing area troops, Lieutenant General Zheng Weishan, Lieutenant General Yuan Shengping and other leading comrades spent the Lunar New Year's Eve with the broad masses of officers and soldiers, joyfully celebrating until late at night, and this morning they exchanged New Year greetings with cadres and soldiers. In many units, the new recruits who enlisted this year wore new uniforms and new ranks that were awarded to them on the 27th, and held an oath-taking ceremony. In the evening, the cadres and soldiers of each squad and platoon wrapped dumplings while having heart-to-heart talks. Veteran soldiers enthusiastically talked about their progress over the past year, new recruits expressed their feelings after joining the army, and cadres discussed leap forward plans with each other. A certain naval unit on the Zhoushan Islands held an exhibition to review the achievements of various tasks over the past year, and held an award ceremony to reward the newly emerging "Five-Good" soldiers and various pacesetters. The "Yang Lian Di Company" repairing roads on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, when visiting the leadership of a certain railway corps unit to congratulate them on the Spring Festival, expressed their determination to strive for greater achievements and to double work efficiency through the reform of three major tools.

    These days, the three armed forces on the Fujian front and the coastal and border defense forces in Guangdong, Zhejiang, and other places are sticking to their combat posts, guarding the people's joyful celebration of the Spring Festival. Many leading cadres of these troops traveled over mountains and rivers to reach positions, airports, and docks, and spent the festival with the soldiers. General Li Tianyou, Lieutenant General Liu Xingyuan, and other leaders of the Guangzhou area troops also went to the forward islands to greet everyone and talk to them. Last year, the vast majority of cadres in various units served as soldiers in the companies. During the Spring Festival, many generals and officers invited their comrades to their homes as guests, and some officers even ran to the company where they served as soldiers to celebrate the festival with their comrades in the same squad. Troops stationed on a certain island in Shandong sent representatives with gifts to congratulate their old comrades who had gone down to the company to serve as soldiers, Lieutenant General Peng Jiaqing, the leader of the Jinan area troops, and others on the New Year.

    During this period, the cultural and recreational activities of the various troops were rich and lively. From cadres to soldiers, from employees to family members, the leading organs of the Shenyang area troops all took to the stage to perform in choruses. At the folk art performance held by a certain unit stationed in Dalian City, more than 500 officers and soldiers used various forms such as local operas, dances, quyi, and folk songs to sing the praises of the great achievements of socialist construction and the good people and deeds that emerged in the unit's completion of various tasks. At the many "Spring Festival Galas" held by the Nanjing area troops, singing, vocal performances, and poetry recitations were also held.
