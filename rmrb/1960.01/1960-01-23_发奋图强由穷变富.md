Striving for Prosperity: Transforming from Poverty to Wealth
    Shu Jia

    Regarding "poverty," many proverbs circulate among the Chinese people, such as: "Though poor, one's ambition is not poor; if one is diligent, the land is not lazy"; "To be poor and have ambition is not true poverty; to be poor and have no ambition is true poverty," and so on. It is evident that, early on, people in our country recognized that poverty is not "innate" or "predestined"; and they also recognized that "poverty" can be changed, with the key to changing poverty lying in "unyielding ambition."

    The news published in this newspaper today that two-thirds of the poor teams in Jilin and other provinces and cities have transformed from poor to rich, and that about half of the poor teams in Guangxi and other provinces and autonomous regions, and one-third of the poor teams in Guangdong and other places, have caught up with the rich teams is extremely encouraging! Why are these poor teams able to catch up with the rich teams in such a short period of time? The fundamental reason is that these "poor" teams, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the state and the commune, have established the great ambition to strive for prosperity and change their impoverished conditions. This is what the people have always said: "Though poor, one's ambition is not poor." In the past, some peasants also strived to change their impoverished conditions, but under the harsh exploitation and oppression of landlords, bureaucrats, and comprador bourgeoisie in old China, they only became poorer and poorer. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the peasants embarked on the path to prosperity pointed out by the Party—the path of mutual aid and cooperation—and the desire to transform from poverty to wealth had the possibility of realization. After the emergence of the people's commune in 1958, this "big and public" red sun, the speed of development from poverty to wealth became even faster. The people's commune opened up the broadest road for poor teams to rapidly transform into rich teams, and provided stronger material guarantees and solid organizational guarantees. The poor teams' ambition to strive for prosperity and change their impoverished conditions was transformed into soaring enthusiasm to overcome difficulties. After more than a year, the beautiful aspiration of a large number of "poor" teams to transform from poverty to wealth has become a reality. That is to say, the leadership of the Party and the people's commune system provided the fundamental guarantee for poor teams to become rich teams; and the poor teams themselves establishing great ambitions and striving for progress is the fundamental driving force for realizing the transformation from poverty to wealth. External causes always operate through internal causes. Once the "poor" teams have the ambition not to be content with "poverty" and to work and make revolution, they have the inherent conditions for transforming from poverty to wealth. Relying on the superior conditions of the people's commune's "big and public" characteristics, and after bravely and tenaciously fighting against difficulties, they transformed the possibility of transforming from poverty to wealth into a beautiful reality. Therefore, "though poor, one's ambition is not poor," and the great ambition to "work and make revolution" is the decisive factor for "poor" teams to quickly catch up with rich teams.

    Now, a large number of "poor" teams have already caught up with the rich teams, and in the future, there will surely be more "poor" teams catching up with the rich teams, making our rising sun even more radiant, and the new countryside of common prosperity and happiness that hundreds of millions of peasants have dreamed of for thousands of years will be fully realized. Therefore, the "poor" teams that have not yet caught up with the rich teams must, under the leadership of the Party, carry forward the spirit of striving for progress, muster soaring enthusiasm, and strive to catch up with the rich teams faster, so as to develop our country's rural economy faster and more comprehensively, and create a more solid foundation for the high-speed development of our country's national economy.

    发奋图强由穷变富
    蜀佳
    关于“穷”，在我国民间流传着很多谚语，如：“人穷志不穷，人勤地不懒”；“穷而有志不是穷，穷而无志是真穷”等。可见，我国人民中很早就有人认识到穷困并不是“天生”的、“命定”的；而且也认识到“穷”是可以改变的，改变穷困面貌的关键就在于“志不穷”。
    本报今天发表了吉林等省市已有三分之二的穷队由穷变富，广西等省、自治区已有半数上下的穷队和广东等地三分之一的穷队赶上了富队的消息，十分令人鼓舞！为什么这些穷队能够在短短的时间内就赶上了富队呢？根本的原因，就在于这些“穷”队在党的领导下，在国家和公社的扶持下，树立了发奋图强、改变穷困面貌的雄心大志。这就是人民群众一向所说的“人穷志不穷”。过去，有些农民也曾发奋要改变穷困面貌，但在旧中国地主、官僚、买办资产阶级等的苛重剥削和压迫下，只能越过越穷。解放后，在党的领导下，农民走上了党所指引的由穷变富的必由之路——互助合作道路，由穷变富的愿望有了实现的可能。1958年出现了人民公社这个“一大二公”的红太阳以后，由穷变富的发展速度就更快了。人民公社为穷队迅速改变成为富队开拓了最广阔的道路，提供了更雄厚的物质保证和坚强的组织保证。穷队的发奋图强、改变穷困面貌的雄心大志，化为战胜困难的冲天干劲，经过一年多的时间，一大批“穷”队由穷变富的美好愿望已经变为现实。这就是说，党的领导和人民公社化，为穷队变富队提供了根本的保证；而穷队自己树立雄心大志，发奋图强，则是实现由穷变富的根本动力。外因总是通过内因起作用的。“穷”队有了不甘于“穷”，要干、要革命的雄心大志，就有了由穷变富的自身内在的条件。他们依靠了人民公社“一大二公”的优越条件，经过英勇顽强地和困难作斗争，才把由穷变富的可能性变成了美好的现实。所以，“人穷志不穷”，“要干，要革命”的雄心大志，是“穷”队迅速赶上富队的决定因素。
    现在，大批“穷”队已经赶上了富队，今后一定会有更多的“穷”队赶上富队，而使我们的初升太阳更加光芒万丈，几亿农民的千百年来所梦想的共同富裕、繁荣幸福的新农村将完全成为现实。因此，目前还没有赶上富队的“穷”队，一定要在党的领导下，发扬发奋图强的精神，鼓足冲天干劲，力求更快地赶上富队，以便更快更全面地发展我国的农村经济，为高速度地发展我国国民经济创造更坚实的基础。
