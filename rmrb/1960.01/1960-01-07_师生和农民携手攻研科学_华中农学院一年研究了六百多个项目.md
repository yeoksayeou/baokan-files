Teachers, Students, and Farmers Join Hands to Tackle Scientific Research
Huazhong Agricultural College Researches Over Six Hundred Projects in One Year

    (Our Dispatch) Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural College, adhering to the principle of combining theory with practice, and through the integration of teachers, students, and farmers, has achieved fruitful results in scientific research work over the past year.

    Since December 1958, teachers and students of Huazhong Agricultural College have been sent to communes in Tianmen and Yingcheng counties, Hubei Province, and to the school's own farm to participate in labor training. During this period, they moved the classroom to the countryside, conducted teaching in conjunction with production practices, and simultaneously carried out extensive mass scientific research activities. Approximately over 90% of the teachers and most of the students participated in scientific research work, conducting research on six hundred and fifty-seven projects, and writing nearly five hundred papers and reports, equivalent to more than twenty times the number of papers completed in the entire year of 1957.

    In carrying out mass scientific research work, Huazhong Agricultural College has paid attention to starting with topic selection based on the needs of socialist construction and combined with the rich practical experience of agricultural production. This has not only quickly identified important research topics but also significantly improved the quality of scientific research work, promoting both production and teaching. For example, Chen Huagui, a soil microbiology research expert, when studying soil microbiology problems in conjunction with production, discovered new activity patterns of nitrifying bacteria in soil microorganisms from production practice, found new theoretical problems in bacteriology research, and also found new ways for microorganisms to serve production. Over the past year, many teachers and students participated in large-scale soil and fruit tree resource surveys throughout the province, providing effective data for production units to rationally utilize resources and arrange future production. Teachers and students have also gained rich practical and theoretical knowledge, enriching the teaching content of soil science and horticulture.

    In conducting research work, the school has consistently adhered to the mass line of close integration of teachers, students, and farmers, combining book knowledge with the rich experience of farmers, giving play to mass wisdom, and creating rich results. Some research topics that had been in the school's laboratory for a long time without results quickly blossomed and bore fruit in the countryside after being studied with farmers. For example, research on antagonistic bacteria had been conducted in the school for seven or eight years with insignificant results. However, during the period of being sent to the countryside, teachers and students, combined with farmers, used indigenous methods to produce antagonistic bacteria fertilizers, which were quickly successfully trial-produced and promoted and applied. The combination of teachers, students, and farmers has also changed the intellectuals' view that farmers do not understand science. A group of professors and students who had been engaged in rice research for many years, in the process of summarizing the experience of labor model Jiang Yeyin, who had not had rotten seedlings in more than twenty years of raising seedlings, discovered that farmers not only have rich experience, but that it includes profound scientific principles, and they improved their scientific research level through earnest summarization and learning.

    师生和农民携手攻研科学
    华中农学院一年研究了六百多个项目
    本报讯　华中农学院坚持理论联系实际的原则，在教师、学生、农民结合下，一年来科学研究工作获得了丰硕的成果。
    华中农学院师生从1958年12月下放到湖北省天门、应城县的公社和校内农场参加劳动锻炼。在下放期间，他们把课堂搬到了农村，结合生产实际进行教学，同时广泛地开展群众性科学研究活动，约有90％以上的教师和大部分学生都参加了科学研究工作，进行了六百五十七个项目的研究，写出了近五百篇的论文和报告，相当于1957年全年完成的论文篇数的二十倍以上。
    华中农学院在开展群众性的科学研究工作中，由选题开始就注意从社会主义建设需要出发，与丰富的农业生产实际结合，不仅很快找到了重要的研究课题，而且使科学研究工作质量显著提高，对生产和教学都起了促进作用。如土壤微生物研究专家陈华癸，结合生产研究土壤微生物问题的时候，就从生产实践中发现了土壤微生物中硝化细菌的新的活动规律，找到了研究细菌学的新的理论问题，也为微生物如何为生产服务，找到了新的途径。一年来，许多师生参加全省规模较大的土壤和果树资源调查，对生产单位合理利用资源和安排今后生产，提供了有效的资料。师生们也从中获得了丰富的实际知识和理论知识，充实了土壤学、园艺学的教学内容。
    在进行研究工作中，学校一直坚持教师、学生、农民紧密结合的群众路线，把书本知识和农民的丰富经验结合起来，发挥了群众智慧，创造了丰富的成果。一些长期在校内实验室作不出结果的研究题目，拿到农村同农民一起研究以后，也很快就在农村开花结果。如关于抗生菌方面的研究，在校内作了七、八年，成绩不显著，而下放农村期间，师生同农民结合起来，用土法生产，很快就试制成功了抗生菌肥料，并得到推广和应用。教师、学生和农民结合，也改变了知识分子认为农民不懂科学的看法。一部分从事水稻研究多年的教授和学生们，在农村同农民一起总结劳动模范姜叶银育秧二十多年没烂过秧苗的经验过程中，就发现农民不仅有丰富的经验，而且其中包括较高深的科学原理，他们从认真总结、学习中，提高了科学研究水平。
