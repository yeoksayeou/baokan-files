Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 3rd: TASS reports that in answering questions from Mr. R. Noble, the president of the Argentine "Clarin" newspaper, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev said, "The problem of disarmament is the most urgent and pressing problem of our time. Currently, it is indeed a central issue."

The questions posed by Noble and Khrushchev's responses were published in Moscow on January 3rd.

Khrushchev emphasized that the people of all countries and all nations in the world are concerned about solving the problem of disarmament. Khrushchev briefly recounted the essence of the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. Khrushchev pointed out, "There is only one desire in making this proposal: to ensure lasting peace, to forever eliminate the fear of the future; therefore, this proposal cannot but receive the unanimous support of the people of all countries."

Khrushchev said, "Without a doubt, if we put our proposal for complete and thorough disarmament to a popular vote in all countries, it would be supported by the vast majority of people in the world."

The head of the Soviet government emphasized that the ten-nation disarmament committee, which will begin its work in 1960, will begin its activities under the clear premise of greatly improving the international situation. Khrushchev added that in this regard, it is first necessary to emphasize the particularly significant meaning of the agreement I reached with President Eisenhower during my visit to the United States and the resolution of the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly; this resolution points out that the problem of complete and thorough disarmament is a most important problem, and therefore all efforts must be made to resolve it as soon as possible.

Khrushchev pointed out that all of this gives rise to the hope that the governments of all countries will show due understanding and adopt a realistic attitude toward the task of solving complete and thorough disarmament. "If this can be the case, then the new year will be recorded in history as the year that began to realize humanity's long-cherished wish for a peace without weapons and armies, a peace without war."

Speaking of the Soviet Union's position on nuclear weapons testing, Khrushchev said, "We advocate a complete and immediate cessation of testing of all types of nuclear weapons." He added, "We are willing to sign an agreement on the perpetual cessation of nuclear testing today, and we believe that all the necessary conditions for doing so have already been created. Now, it is up to our Western counterparts."

Khrushchev recalled that the Soviet government has now stopped all tests of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and if the Western countries do not resume such tests, the Soviet Union will not resume them either.

Khrushchev emphasized that the warming of the international climate last year undoubtedly had a good impact on the development of international trade.

The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers pointed out that the Soviet Union is now trading with more than seventy countries. "We advocate further expanding mutually beneficial economic and trade ties between countries. We want neither a 'cold war' nor a hot war. Any businessman from any country can come to the Soviet Union at any time to conduct trade negotiations and sign contracts. This also includes representatives from Latin American countries, and the Soviet Union will always warmly welcome them."

    赫鲁晓夫答阿根廷“号角报”社长问
    各国人民关心解决裁军问题
    苏联主张立即签订永远停止核试验的协定
    据新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在回答阿根廷“号角报”社长罗·诺布勒先生的问题时说，“裁军问题是当代最紧要、最迫切的问题。在目前，这确实是个中心问题。”
    莫斯科3日发表了诺布勒提出的问题和赫鲁晓夫的答复。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，各国人民和世界各个国家都关心解决裁军问题。赫鲁晓夫简短地追述了苏联提出的关于全面彻底裁军的建议的实质。赫鲁晓夫指出，“提出这个建议只有一个愿望：确保持久和平、永远消除对未来的恐惧，因此这个建议不能不得到各国人民的一致支持。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，“毋庸置疑，如果把我们关于全面彻底裁军的建议交给各国人民投票公决，那么，它将受到世界上绝大多数人的支持。”
    苏联政府首脑着重指出，即将在1960年开始工作的十国裁军委员会，将在有着大大改善国际局势的明显前提的条件下，开始它的活动。赫鲁晓夫补充说，在这方面，首先必须着重指出我在访问美国时同艾森豪威尔总统达成的协议以及联合国大会第十四届会议的决议的特别重大的意义；这一决议指出：全面彻底裁军的问题是一个最重要的问题，因此必须竭尽一切努力来尽快地加以解决。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，所有这一切使人们产生了一种希望，即希望各国政府对解决全面彻底裁军的任务都表现出应有的理解和采取现实主义的态度。“如果能够这样，那么，新的一年将作为开始实现人类关于没有武器和军队的和平、没有战争的和平的夙愿的一年而载入史册。”
    赫鲁晓夫谈到苏联在核武器试验方面的立场时说：“我们主张彻底地、同时立即地停止试验各种类型的核武器。”他补充说：“我们愿意今天就签订关于永远停止核试验的协定，而且我们认为，这样做所需要的一切必要条件都已经造成。现在，事情取决于我们的对方西方国家。”
    赫鲁晓夫追述，苏联政府现在已经停止了原子武器和氢武器的一切试验，如果西方国家不恢复这种试验的话，苏联也不会恢复它。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，去年国际气候的转暖无疑地也对发展国际贸易有良好的影响。
    苏联部长会议主席指出，苏联现在同七十多个国家进行贸易。“我们主张进一步扩大各国之间互利的经济联系和贸易联系。我们既不要‘冷战’，也不要热战。任何国家的任何一个商人在任何时候都可以到苏联来进行贸易谈判和签订合同。这也包括拉丁美洲国家的代表，苏联将永远热情地欢迎他们。”
