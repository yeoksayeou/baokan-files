    Fully Utilize Pigskin
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    During the Spring Festival, vigorously developing the work of peeling and purchasing pigskin is of great significance for ensuring the continued leap forward in leather industrial production and ensuring that China's economic construction and people's lives obtain more and better leather products. In order to do this work well, many places are actively carrying out organizational and technical preparations. In addition to calling on all pig slaughtering and pig raising departments in the city to peel off as much pigskin as possible, the relevant leading departments in Beijing have also instructed the Municipal Slaughterhouse to be responsible for teaching and guiding pigskin peeling techniques, and have also made specific regulations and arrangements for pigskin purchase prices, peeling tools, strengthening procurement, and processing.
    Pigskin is an important resource for China's leather industry. In the past two years, thanks to the active research and experimentation of leather industry workers in China, pigskin leather making technology has been greatly improved. Pigskin leather has become exquisite and beautiful leather. More than 30 kinds of daily necessities made of pigskin leather are both beautiful and durable, and can completely rival cowhide leather products; moreover, they are cheap and are generally welcomed by consumers. Leather workers in Shanghai and other places also use pigskin leather instead of cowhide leather to make various industrial leather products. With the improvement of China's leather making technology, the use of pigskin leather is gradually expanding. Therefore, the demand for pigskin is also increasing. On the other hand, compared with large livestock such as cattle and horses, pigs reproduce quickly and have a short growth period. From birth to slaughter, it generally does not exceed one year. In particular, since the Party and the government called for raising pigs in large numbers, the pig raising industry has developed rapidly throughout the country. The pig raising movement of one pig per person and one pig per mu of land has been universally carried out throughout the country, and the number of pigs has increased rapidly, thus opening up a rich source of raw materials for using pigskin to make leather. Both possible and necessary, the pigskin leather making industry will surely develop greatly. If 30 million pigskins can be used to make leather this year, the leather industry can achieve greater development on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. And 30 million pigskins, that is, 30 million pigs, only account for a very small proportion of the total annual pig slaughter volume; however, the role of comprehensive utilization of pigs is very large. Therefore, we must attach great importance to the work of peeling pigskin in order to fully utilize pigskin.
    Although China slaughters live pigs all year round, it is more concentrated during the four festivals (Spring Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, and New Year) and two busy seasons (autumn harvest and summer harvest). According to past habits, the number of pigs slaughtered around the Spring Festival accounts for more than 30% of the total for the year. Therefore, seizing the Spring Festival to carry out pigskin peeling work is a key to completing the annual pigskin peeling task this year, and also a key time to ensure the continued leap forward in the leather industry this year. When such a time comes, we should not only continue to peel pigskin in large quantities in areas where there is a past habit of peeling pigskin, but also strive to create conditions and carry out peeling in areas where there is no past habit of peeling pigskin; we should peel pigskin not only in cities but also in rural people's communes.
    Pigskin peeling has a long history and good experience in Sichuan, Shandong and other places. However, from a national perspective, pigskin peeling is still a new task, and most areas do not have enough experience. How to organize peeling, what tools to use, how to purchase and store, etc., are all new problems that need to be solved quickly. In order to do a good job in pigskin peeling during the Spring Festival, relevant industrial and commercial departments in various places must, under the leadership of the Party committee, on the one hand, publicize the significance of pigskin peeling to the masses, and on the other hand, actively organize manpower to learn and promote pigskin peeling technology, learn how to pickle pigskin, store pigskin, and transport pigskin. We must ensure that we peel more, peel well, pickle well, and store well; we must also ensure that we purchase quickly and transport quickly. Only in this way can we fully realize the economic value of pigskin and ensure the needs of the rapid development of the leather industry.
    The Spring Festival is coming soon. Opportunities do not come twice. Seize the time to do a good job in the organizational work and technical preparation work for pigskin peeling as soon as possible, and truly peel as much pigskin as possible!

    充分利用猪皮
    本报评论员
    在春节期间，大力开展开剥猪皮和收购猪皮工作，对保证皮革工业生产的继续跃进，保证我国经济建设和人民生活得到更多更好的皮革制品，有着十分重要的意义。许多地方为了做好这个工作，正在积极进行组织准备和技术准备工作。北京市有关领导部门除了号召全市宰猪、养猪的部门尽可能把猪皮剥下来外，还责成市屠宰厂负责传授和指导开剥猪皮的技术，并对猪皮收购价格、剥皮工具、加强收购、加工等工作也作了具体的规定和安排。
    猪皮是我国制革工业的重要资源。近两年来，由于我国制革工业职工积极地进行研究和试验，猪皮制革技术已经有了很大的提高。猪皮革已经成为细致美观的皮革。利用猪皮革制成的三十多种日用品，既美观又耐用，完全可以和牛皮革制品媲美；而且价格便宜，受到消费者的普遍欢迎。上海等地的制革工人，还用猪皮革代替牛皮革做出各种工业用的革制品。随着我国制革技术的提高，猪皮革的用途正在逐渐扩大。因此，猪皮需要量也就随之增大。另一方面，比起牛、马等大家畜来，猪繁殖快，成长期短，从出生到屠宰，一般都不超过一年。特别是党和政府号召大量养猪以来，全国各地养猪事业发展很快，一人一头猪、一亩地一头猪的养猪运动，已在全国普遍开展起来，猪的头数迅速增长，从而给利用猪皮制革开辟了丰富的原料来源。既有可能，又是需要，猪皮制革事业必能大大发展。今年如果能够利用三千万张猪皮制革，制革工业就可以在去年大跃进的基础上有更大的发展。而三千万张猪皮，也就是三千万头猪，只占全年生猪总屠宰量的很小比例；而对于猪的综合利用的作用却是很大。所以，我们必须十分重视猪皮的开剥工作，以充分利用猪皮。
    我国虽然一年到头都屠宰生猪，但是，比较集中的还是四节（春节、中秋节、端午节、新年）和两忙（秋忙和夏忙）。按照历年习惯，春节前后宰猪的数量约占全年的30％以上。所以抓紧春节开展剥取猪皮工作，是今年完成全年剥猪皮任务的一个关键，也是保证今年制革工业继续跃进的一个关键时间。我们应当在这样的时间到来时，既要在过去有剥猪皮习惯的地区继续大量开剥，也要在过去没有剥猪皮习惯的地区努力创造条件，进行开剥；既要在城市开剥，也要在农村人民公社开剥。
    开剥猪皮，在四川、山东等地都有较长的历史，也有很好的经验。但是，从全国来看，剥猪皮还是一项新的工作，大多数地区经验还不足。怎样组织开剥，使用什么工具，怎样收购和保管等等，都是一些新问题，需要很快解决。为了在春节期间做好剥猪皮的工作，各地有关工业和商业部门必须在党委的领导下，一方面向群众宣传剥猪皮的意义，另一方面积极组织人力学习和推广剥猪皮的技术，学习腌制猪皮、保管猪皮和运输猪皮经验。一定要做到剥得多，剥得好，腌制好，保管好；还要做到收购快，调运快。这样，才能充分发挥猪皮的经济价值，才能保证制革工业迅速发展的需要。
    春节就要到来了。机不可失，时不再来。及早抓紧做好开剥猪皮的组织工作和技术准备工作，真正做到开剥猪皮越多越好！
