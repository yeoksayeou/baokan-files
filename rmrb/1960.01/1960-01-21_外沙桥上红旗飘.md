    Red Flags Fluttering on the Waisha Bridge

    Miracle

    The Waisha Bridge is located in the lower reaches of the Han River in Guangdong Province, spanning the Waisha River in Chenghai County. It is an important bridge on the Shantou to Zhangzhou highway. This permanent bridge was built last year by the Party and government of Chenghai, mobilizing the masses. Recently, more than 100 representatives who participated in the Guangdong Province Highway Transportation Advanced Experience Exchange Conference in Chao'an visited this famous bridge with admiration.

    The Waisha Bridge is 620 meters long, has 106 piers, is 6 meters high, and 6.5 meters wide. The entire bridge is built of granite, and the bridge deck is made of reinforced steel and concrete. What is surprising and exciting is that it is not only a highway bridge, but also creatively has 106 movable sluice gates, making it a dual-purpose bridge for highways and water conservancy. The completion of this bridge enables 100,000 mu of farmland on both sides of the river to be irrigated by gravity flow. Looking back at the history of highway bridges in Guangdong, there is no precedent for a permanent bridge that serves both highway and water conservancy purposes. In the past, many engineers and senior technicians had pondered this issue, but they were afraid that combining a highway bridge with a water conservancy project would ruin the bridge, and they didn't dare to touch it. However, this technical problem was solved in the mass movement.

    How long would it take for professional departments to build such a complex and large bridge? One of the visiting representatives asked an experienced engineer, and the answer was: "At least two years." So, how long did it take Chenghai to mobilize the masses to build this bridge? Only thirty days!

    The cost of this bridge is also surprisingly low. According to the engineer, if a professional department were to build it, the unit price per meter would be at least 2,000 yuan or more. The actual cost of this bridge was only about 1,000 yuan per meter.

    What about the quality? This is what people are most concerned about. Many people were worried that it would not withstand the test of floods. However, after the bridge was completed last year, it has dealt with floods several times, including the largest flood peak in a century, and it has stood firm all along.

    The technical backbone for building this bridge – the "local engineers" – were mainly a dozen experienced old farmers in water conservancy, but more importantly, they relied on the broad masses. The Party Committee and headquarters at the construction site, which organized and directed the masses to bring their collective wisdom into play, were the "chief engineers." They created the miracle. Due to the glorious achievements of this bridge, the unit that organized this project was named an advanced unit and attended the National Conference of Heroes held in October last year.

    Long Live the Mass Movement

    High speed is a distinct characteristic of the Waisha Bridge. It was the mass movement that gave birth to this high speed. The victory of the Waisha Bridge is the victory of the mass movement. Although many difficulties were encountered during the bridge construction, with the mass movement, there is no invincibility.

    At the beginning of the bridge construction, the problem of insufficient materials was encountered. The materials used for this bridge included more than 20,000 cubic meters of stone alone, as well as 102 tons of steel bars, 400 tons of cement, 340 cubic meters of timber, more than 47,000 dan of shellfish lime, 110,000 dan of lime sand, and 160,000 dan of sand and soil. Don't think that for a project completed in just one month, all the materials were prepared before construction. In fact, there was nothing before construction. The only materials that could be obtained locally were stone and sand and soil. Even though there were stones on the nearby hills, it would take an unknown amount of time to process more than 20,000 cubic meters of stone blocks and rubble, and they didn't even have a catty of dynamite in their hands. However, in the face of these serious difficulties, the Party Committee put forward the following slogan: "Cross the material barrier in ten days! Build the bridge in one month!" After the Party Committee put forward this fighting call, the earth-shaking mass movement began. They needed stone blocks and rubble, but they couldn't allow a long time to be spent on quarrying and processing. Tens of thousands of farmers dismantled the old city foundations of Chenghai City and Pengzhou City. After the broad masses heard the news that the project would irrigate 100,000 mu of farmland and also be a traffic bridge, they voluntarily donated many stone blocks and rubble. One family member of an overseas Chinese even called the migrant workers to her home and carried out the stone blocks used as chairs. When there was not enough cement, they used shellfish lime instead, based on the experience of large-scale water conservancy projects in recent years, taking materials locally. When there were no steel bars, they used indigenous methods to set up processing plants and cast them themselves.

    In that month, the construction site was simply seething. Tens of thousands of troops from various communes, more than 300 civilian boats, thousands of handcarts, and a dozen cars launched competitions, working hard and cleverly. Leading cadres, office cadres, commercial and medical personnel also went to the construction site in large numbers, and even the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shantou sent a company to participate in the construction.

    The whole Party and the whole people acted together, and the material barrier was broken as scheduled in ten days!

    The Great Achievements of the "Local Engineers"

    In the process of building the Waisha Bridge, the "local engineers" made great achievements.

    The foundation engineering of this bridge is unique. According to custom, to build a permanent bridge on a sandy riverbed, it is necessary to dig open very deep sand layers and build the foundation below. Because sand is loose and easily eroded, no one dares to build a foundation on the sand. At the same time, straight piles must be driven down to stabilize the foundation. However, this bridge neither dug sand layers nor drove straight piles, but started directly on the sand. "A tall bridge starts from the ground." People who have built bridges all know that dealing with the foundation is a major technical hurdle. If it is not done well, the entire bridge will collapse. Now this bridge is a dual-purpose bridge for highways and water conservancy, and yet at this juncture, they carried out bold innovations.

    Yu Changfeng, the deputy chief commander of the Waisha Bridge project, this outstanding "local engineer," introduced the situation at that time to us, saying: They were not satisfied with the old rules. If they followed the old rules, first driving sheet piles, digging out the sand layer, and then building the foundation, they did not know how much labor would be used, how much time would be extended, and how much material would be consumed. Moreover, this is a bridge with sluice gates, and the entire length under the bridge is foundation engineering, requiring even more manpower and material resources. The experience of large-scale water conservancy projects in recent years after liberation told them that although river sand has the disadvantage of being easily eroded, it also has the advantage of having a very strong bearing capacity. As long as revetments are built inside and outside the bridge foundation and covered with clay, the quality of the foundation can be guaranteed without digging the sand. At the same time, experience also told them that the method of using straight piles to stabilize the foundation has great shortcomings, being prone to water intrusion and causing the foundation to sink. It is better to use horizontal piles instead. Therefore, they adopted a combined foundation approach based on their rich experience. The foundation problem of highway and water conservancy dual-purpose bridges, which had troubled engineering technicians for many years, was solved by them in this way.

    This major innovation not only ensured the quality and saved a large amount of manpower and material resources, but more importantly, it saved time. The fact that the Waisha Bridge could be built in one month is inseparable from this technological innovation.

    During the construction of the Waisha Bridge, there were also many stories about "local engineers" learning from traditional experience to solve technical difficulties. When the project entered the stage of erecting the bridge deck, the piers were very high, and it took fifty people to lift a prefabricated reinforced concrete slab from under the bridge. This was not only strenuous and dangerous for high-altitude operations, but the more serious problem was that at this rate, it would not be completed in a year. The Party Committee and headquarters at the construction site immediately convened a "Zhuge Liang meeting." At the meeting, a "local engineer" said: "Legend has it that ancient ancestors built tall towers by using the method of stacking sand." Following this method, they mobilized the masses to build sand embankments along the piers. The sand embankments were as high as the piers, and people operated on the sand embankments on the bridge deck. The difficulty was solved in this way.

    外沙桥上红旗飘

    奇迹
    外沙桥位于广东省韩江下游，横架在澄海县的外沙河上。它是汕头到漳州公路线上的一座重要桥梁。这座永久式的大桥是去年由澄海的党政发动群众建成的。最近在潮安参加广东省公路运输先进经验交流大会的一百多位代表，都以仰慕的心情参观了这座有名的大桥。
    外沙桥全长有六百二十米，一百零六个桥墩，六米高，六点五米宽，全桥用花岗石砌成，桥面用的是钢筋和混凝土。令人惊奇和兴奋的是：它不仅是公路桥，而且创造性地设置有一百零六个活动闸门，一举两得成了公路、水利两用桥。这座桥的建成，使两岸十万亩农田得到自流灌溉。翻开广东的公路桥梁历史，做公路、水利两用的永久式大桥，还没有先例。过去，也曾经有不少工程师和高级技术员为这个问题动过脑筋，但是，他们怕把公路桥和水利工程连在一起会搞垮桥梁，一直动都不敢动。而这个技术悬案，却在群众运动中解决了。
    建设这样复杂和大型的桥梁，如果由专业部门来进行需要多少时间？有一位参观的代表问了一位富有专业经验的工程师，得到的回答是：“起码二年。”那么，澄海发动群众建成这座桥花了多少时间呢？只用了三十天！
    这座桥的成本也低得惊人。据工程师说，如果专业部门来修筑，每米的单价起码二千元以上。而这座桥的实际成本，每米只用了一千元左右。
    质量如何？这是人们最关心的问题。不少人曾担心它经受不住洪水的考验。但是，这座桥去年建成以后，就和洪水打了几次交道，而且是百年来的大洪峰，它一直稳固地屹立着。
    建这座桥依靠的技术骨干——“土工程师”，主要是十几个富有水利经验的老农，而更主要的是他们依靠了广大群众。组织和指挥群众发挥集体智慧的工地党委会和指挥部，就是“总工程师”。奇迹就是他们创造出来的。由于这座桥的辉煌成就，主办这个工程的单位被评为先进单位，出席了去年10月召开的全国群英大会。
    群众运动万岁
    高速度，是外沙桥的鲜明特色，诞生高速度的却是群众运动。外沙桥的胜利，就是群众运动的胜利。尽管建桥中碰到了许多困难，有了群众运动，就无往而不胜了。
    建桥工程一开始，就碰上了材料不足的问题。这座桥使用的材料，仅石料就有二万多立方，还有一百零二吨钢筋，四百吨水泥，三百四十公方木料，四万七千多担贝壳灰，十一万担石灰砂，十六万担砂土。别以为这个仅一个月完成的工程，在施工前什么材料都准备好了。其实，施工以前什么都没有。能够就地取材的只有石头和砂土。就是附近山岗上有石头，要去加工二万多立方的条石和块石，时间不知拖到哪一天去了，何况他们手上连一斤炸药都没有。可是，在这严重困难面前，党委提出的却是这样的口号：“十天跨过材料关！一个月建成桥！”当党委提出这个战斗号召以后，翻天复地的群众运动就开始了。需要条石和块石，但是不容许用长时间去开山加工。数以万计的农民大军，便把澄海城和蓬州城的旧城基拆了下来。广大群众听到兴建的是能够灌溉十万亩农田，同时又是交通大桥的消息以后，自动捐献了许多条石和块石。有一个华侨家属，还把民工叫到她家里去，抬出了作为椅子用的条石。水泥不够，他们便根据几年来大兴水利的经验，就地取材用贝壳灰来代替。没有钢筋，他们便土法上马，自己搭起加工厂进行铸造。
    在那一个月里，工地简直沸腾了。来自各个公社的数万大军、三百多条民船、数以千计的手推车、十几部汽车，开展竞赛，大干巧干。领导干部、机关干部、商业和医务人员，也大批地走上工地，还有驻汕头的解放军，也派来一个连参加建设。
    全党全民齐动手，材料关如期十天攻破了！
    “土工程师”的丰功伟绩
    在修建外沙桥的过程中，“土工程师”立下了丰功伟绩。
    这座桥的基础工程，与众不同。按照惯例，在沙质河床上建筑永久式大桥，要挖开很深很深的沙层，在下面起基。因为沙是松动的，易于流失，谁也不敢在沙滩上起基。同时要打下直桩去稳定基础。可是，这座桥既没有挖沙层，也没有打直桩，在沙滩上就干起来了。“万丈高桥从地起”。建过桥梁的人都懂得，处理基础是个大技术关，搞不好，全桥都会垮。现在这座桥是公路、水利两用桥，然而就在这个关节上，他们进行了大胆的革新。
    外沙桥工程副总指挥余昌丰，这个出色的“土工程师”，向我们介绍当时的情况说：他们不满意老规矩的做法。如果按老规矩，先打板桩，挖去沙层，然后起基，那不知要用多少劳动力，延长多少时间，耗用多少材料。何况这是有水闸的桥梁，桥下全长都是基础工程，需要的人力、物力就更多了。解放后历年来大兴水利工程的经验告诉他们，河沙虽然有容易流失的缺点，但也有承载力很强的优点，只要桥基内外修筑护坦，用粘土铺盖，不挖沙也能保证基础的质量。同时，经验也告诉他们，打直桩稳基的办法有很大缺点，要冒水，容易使基础下沉，改放横桩还比较好。因此，他们就按照自己丰富的经验，采用了联合基础的做法。多少年来工程技术人员伤脑筋的公路、水利两用桥的基础问题，在他们手里就这样解决了。
    这个重大的创举，不仅保证了质量，节约了大批人力、物力，更重要的是赢得了时间。外沙桥能一个月建成，同这个技术革新是分不开的。
    修筑外沙桥过程中，还有许多关于“土工程师”们学习传统经验解决技术困难的故事。当工程进入架设桥面的时候，桥墩很高，由桥下抬预制钢筋混凝土板上去，五十个人才能抬一块，不仅高空作业吃力、危险，更严重的问题是，这样下去，一年都修不完。工地党委和指挥部立即召开了“诸葛亮会议”，会上一个“土工程师”说：“传说古代祖先建高塔时，是利用叠沙上去的办法。”他们按照这种方法，发动群众沿桥墩筑起了沙堤，沙堤和桥墩一样高，人们就在桥面的沙堤上进行操作，困难就这样解决了。
