Yuecheng Reservoir Performance Diary
Hebei Provincial Drama Troupe, Liu Geng

    December 12th
    The long-awaited day has finally arrived. Our troupe brought "Taming Dragons and Tigers" to Yuecheng Reservoir. On the twenty-odd li journey from Jiangwucheng Railway Station to Yuecheng, my first impression was: this is the real front line of production! Look, on the newly opened, flat highway, brand-new Liberation-brand trucks were running back and forth. So many tractors, bulldozers, and road rollers demonstrated the powerful mechanization of the construction site. Neatly organized teams of laborers, carrying shovels and picks, strode purposefully toward the construction site. A team of male laborers passed by, shouting slogans "One, two, three, four." Over there, another team of female laborers walked by, singing "Work hard in December, break through the winter barrier..." It was truly a magnificent picture, dazzling us.
        December 15th
    At one o'clock in the morning, we marched at a rapid pace with gongs and drums towards the spillway tunnel construction site. The piercing north wind kept blowing, and the mountain road, which had just been rained on, was muddy. Everyone walked forward, sinking deep with each step. Before long, we arrived at the construction site. Here, the first thing that caught our eye was the vast sea of lights, as bright as day. Some laborers were carrying mud, others were carrying stones, moving in a constant stream along countless steep, serpentine paths. Some people were only wearing a small jacket, but every red face was dripping with sweat. The actors, seeing this scene, couldn't wait to run over and join this torrent of labor. But the loudspeakers had already announced the news of our performance, so we had to perform first. When we finished the last program, before the team leader could speak, everyone rolled up their trousers and picked up tools to start working. When the laborers saw the actors working too, they worked even harder, as if secretly competing with us. Some laborers enthusiastically shouted, "Keep up the good work," "Respond to the drama troupe's enthusiastic greetings with practical actions"....
    On the way back, everyone talked excitedly. Some talked about their experiences, and some complained that the working time was too short.
        December 17th
    In the afternoon, we came to the Nangong construction site. We heard that Wang Qibao, the province's famous bulldozer hero, known as the "Bulldozer King," was at this construction site. Everyone wanted to see this hero with their own eyes. Suddenly someone shouted: Wang Qibao is here! Looking over, sure enough, a small cart came towards us. The person pushing the cart was of medium height, with a thin face and bright eyes, full of energy. A red flag was stuck on the cart, with the words "Bulldozer King Wang Qibao" written on it. Everyone immediately swarmed around him. Some shook his hand, some asked questions. Many comrades picked up iron shovels and started loading soil into the cart. He didn't rest, wiped his sweat, and started working with everyone. The soil was loaded higher and higher, more and more solid, a full thousand catties, but he pushed the cart quickly and steadily, and disappeared in a flash.
    At this time, the actors were excitedly shoveling soil and pushing carts, working harder and harder. The laborers' camp leader announced a break, and we immediately gathered to perform small programs for the laborers. At some point, Da Zhang had adapted Wang Qibao's heroic deeds into a new song, with rhyming lyrics and a tune based on labor chants, which the laborers welcomed with applause. The performance ended as the sun was setting. Seeing that the laborers were working even harder after watching the performance, it reminded me of the silk banner given to us by the Yongnian laborers yesterday, which read "You also have a share in the achievement of eradicating the Zhang River." We dare not accept the credit, but we feel very honored to be able to sing a small song for the heroes who are eradicating the Zhang River and building the reservoir!

    岳城水库慰问演出日记
    河北省话剧团　刘庚
      十二月十二日
    期望已久的一天终于到来了。我们团带着“降龙伏虎”来到了岳城水库。从讲武城火车站到岳城的二十多里路途中，给我的第一个印象是：这才是真正的生产第一线！看吧，新开辟的平坦的公路上，来来往往跑着崭新的解放牌汽车，那么多拖拉机、推土机、压路机显示了工地上机械化的雄厚的威力。整齐的民工队伍，扛着锨、镐，昂首阔步的奔向工地。一队男民工过来了，“一、二、三、四”呼着口号。那边又走过一队女民工，唱着“大干十二月，闯过越冬关……”的歌子。真是一幅气势雄伟的图画，使我们眼花缭乱。
        十二月十五日
    深夜一点，我们敲锣打鼓以急行军的速度奔向泄洪洞工地。刺骨的北风不停地刮着，刚下过雨的山路泥泞不堪，大家深一脚浅一脚的向前走，不大的工夫就来到了工地。在这里，首先映入眼帘的是那辽阔的灯海，明如白昼。民工们有的挑泥，有的抬石头，在无数条陡峭的长蛇小路上，川流不息地行进。有的人身上只穿了一件小褂，但每张红通通的脸上还淌着热汗。演员们看到这种情景，恨不得立刻跑过去，卷进这支劳动的洪流。但广播器里已经介绍了我们演出的消息，只好先演出吧。当我们演完了最后一个节目，没等领队人发话，大家挽挽裤腿，拿起工具就去干起来了。民工们看到演员们也干起来，他们干的更起劲了，好像暗地里和我们竞赛似的。有些民工热情地喊着：“加油干哪”、“以实际行动回答话剧团的热情慰问”……。
    回来的路上，大家兴奋地说个没完，有的人讲着自己的体会，有的人埋怨劳动时间太短了。
        十二月十七日
    下午，我们来到南宫工地。听说全省驰名的推土英雄、号称“推土大王”的王其保就在这个工地。大家都想亲眼看看这位英雄。忽然有人喊：王其保来了！一看，果然迎面来了一辆小车，推车的人中等身材，瘦瘦的脸，明亮的大眼，可有精神。车上插着一面红旗，上面写着“推土大王王其保”。大家一看，立刻一窝蜂似的围了上去，有的握手，有的问长问短。许多同志拿起铁锨就往小车里装土。他没有休息，擦了擦汗，便同大伙儿一块干了起来。土越装越高，越装越实，足足装了一千斤，但是他推起车来又快又稳，一溜小跑就不见了。
    这时候，演员们兴奋地铲着土、推着车，干得越来越有劲，民工营长宣布休息了，我们立刻集合起来给民工们表演小节目。大张不知道什么时候把王其保的英雄事迹编了个新歌，合辙压韵用劳动号子配了曲，唱的民工们直拍手欢迎。演出结束已是夕阳西下的时候了。看到民工们看了演出以后干的更欢，使我想起昨天永年民工们赠给我们的一面锦旗，那上面写着“根治漳河功绩也有你们一份”。功绩怎敢当；但能为根治漳河、建设水库的英雄们唱一支小小的歌子，我们也就感到很光荣了！
