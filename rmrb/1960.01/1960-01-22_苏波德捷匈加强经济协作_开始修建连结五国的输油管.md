(Comprehensive report by our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: European socialist countries are implementing specialization and cooperation in a series of national economic sectors, particularly in machine manufacturing, the chemical industry, metallurgy, and the construction of the European oil pipeline.

The European oil pipeline, starting from the oil processing region in the middle of the Volga River and passing through Mozyr (Belarus), will be divided into two branches: one going north to Poland and the German Democratic Republic, and the other going south to Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Currently, the world's longest oil pipeline is the Trans-Canada pipeline, which crosses North America from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic coast. After the completion of this European oil pipeline, its total length will reach more than 4,000 kilometers, exceeding the length of the Trans-Canada pipeline. The countries through which this pipeline passes will be responsible for constructing the section within their respective territories. The Soviet Union will provide strong support to fraternal countries in terms of both technology and personnel. Currently, the construction of the section of this pipeline within Czechoslovakia has already begun, and the Soviet Union is conducting exploration work and will also begin construction this year. The entire pipeline will be completed in three to four years.

During the period from 1959 to 1964, the construction of joint power transmission lines between the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary is planned. These transmission lines will connect Romania with Czechoslovakia and Hungary with western Ukraine. In 1962, the electricity transmitted from the Soviet Union to Hungary alone will reach one billion kilowatt-hours.

Member states of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance also plan to make extensive use of the hydropower resources of rivers flowing through the territories of several member states to generate electricity. Drafts for the unified utilization of the Danube River's hydropower are currently being designed.

With the help of the Soviet Union, atomic energy power stations are being built in European People's Democratic countries. The German Democratic Republic is building the first such power station. Atomic energy power stations will also be built in Czechoslovakia and Poland.

With the help of the participating countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the mining of iron-nickel ore in Albania and iron ore in Bulgaria is developing rapidly, not only for the needs of these countries' own steel industries, but also to expand the nickel and iron resources of other People's Democratic countries.

    苏波德捷匈加强经济协作
    开始修建连结五国的输油管
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：欧洲各社会主义国家之间正在一系列国民经济部门中，特别是在机器制造业、化学工业、冶金工业以及建设欧洲输油管方面，实行专业化和协作化。
    欧洲石油输送管以伏尔加河中部的石油加工地区为起点，经过摩西尔（白俄罗斯）后，将分为两支，一支向北直到波兰和德意志民主共和国，一支向南直达捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利。目前全世界最长的输油管是从太平洋沿岸到大西洋沿岸横穿北美的特兰斯卡纳德油管，而这条欧洲输油管建成后，总长度达四千多公里，将超过特兰斯卡纳德油管的长度。这条油管所经过的国家将负责修建辖境内的一段。无论在技术方面或干部方面，苏联都将大力支援兄弟国家。目前这条油管在捷克斯洛伐克境内的部分已开始动工修建，苏联正在进行勘查工作，今年也将动工。全部油管将在三、四年内建成。
    在1959年到1964年期间，规定建设德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利之间的联合输电线。这些输电线将把罗马尼亚同捷克斯洛伐克，把匈牙利同乌克兰西部联接起来。1962年，仅从苏联输往匈牙利的电力就将达十亿度。
    经济互助委员会成员国还计划广泛利用流经几个成员国境内的河流的水力资源来发电。目前正在设计统一利用多瑙河水力的草案。
    在苏联的帮助下，正在欧洲人民民主国家建造原子能发电站。德意志民主共和国正在建设第一座这样的发电站。在捷克斯洛伐克和波兰，也将建设原子能发电站。
    在经济互助委员会参加国的帮助下，阿尔巴尼亚铁镍矿石和保加利亚铁矿石的开采正在快速发展，这不单是为了这些国家自己的钢铁工业的需要，而且也是为了扩大其他人民民主国家的镍和铁的资源。（附图片）
