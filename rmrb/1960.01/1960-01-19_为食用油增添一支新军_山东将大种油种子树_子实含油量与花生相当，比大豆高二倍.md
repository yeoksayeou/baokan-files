    Adding a New Force to Edible Oil
    Shandong to Massively Plant Oil Seed Trees
    Seed Kernels Containing Oil Equivalent to Peanuts, Twice as High as Soybeans
    (Our Dispatch) Shandong Province's agricultural and forestry departments recently discovered that the "Oil Seed Tree" (a naturally growing tree, also known as "Cheliangmu," resembling an apricot tree, with a short trunk and large crown) is a very good woody oil-bearing tree species, with the fruit pulp and kernels containing rich oil. According to tests by the Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau, the oil content of the kernels is equivalent to that of peanuts, twice as high as that of soybeans. Oil Seed Trees are mainly distributed in the Changwei and Zibo special districts, with a higher concentration in counties such as Yidu, Linqu, and Boshan. Small amounts also grow in Linyi, Jinan, Yantai, and other places. Local people have used these seeds to extract oil, with the highest oil yield reaching over 35%. The extracted oil is initially green, then turns yellow, and its quality is no less than soybean oil or peanut oil. In Nanhouyu Village of the Zhuya People's Commune in Yidu County, 80% of farmers consume this oil year-round; Liugezhuang Village in the Wuli Commune has more than 40 Oil Seed Trees. In 1957, they harvested over 2,700 jin of seeds, with the oil yield equaling the entire village's annual edible oil supply.
    Oil Seed Trees are suitable for growing on bluestone mountains and slightly alkaline soils. According to the masses, when planted in better soil, they can grow more than ten centimeters thick in six or seven years, yielding about twenty jin of seeds; after fifty years, the diameter at breast height can reach fifty to sixty centimeters, with each tree yielding over three hundred jin of seeds. A twenty-five-year-old tree in the Guanyin Production Team of the Wuli Commune, growing in the crevices of terraced field edging stones, has a breast height diameter of twenty centimeters and produces forty jin of seeds annually. There are two planting methods in this village: the first method is to use the strong sprouting characteristics of the Oil Seed Tree, cutting down the large tree and nurturing the seedlings sprouting from the roots into trees, which can grow five to six chi in the same year; the second method is to use seed propagation. According to the Yidu County Nursery and the Qianjin Production Team of the Wuli Commune's seedling experiments in 1955, the germination and survival rate is over 90% (the oil on the outer layer of the seeds must be removed before raising seedlings, otherwise they will not germinate easily).
    The wood of the Oil Seed Tree is hard and has a fine texture, which can be used to make axles and handles for farm tools. Its fresh branches can be burned, proving that the branches and trunks of the Oil Seed Tree also contain oil.
    The Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee attach great importance to using Oil Seed Trees for oil extraction, believing that this tree is one of the important tree species for obtaining edible oil in the future. The Provincial Party Committee has issued a notice requiring all localities to actively plant this tree; areas with Oil Seed Trees should strengthen the protection and cultivation of mother trees, and take measures to retain all the seeds harvested this year in order to massively propagate seedlings.
    Since the winter of 1959, Shandong Province has been focusing on the production of woody oil materials. It is planned that by 1962, the province will develop 1.05 billion woody oil-bearing trees (including walnuts, peppers, and Oil Seed Trees), striving to achieve self-sufficiency in edible oil from woody oil materials in ten years.

    为食用油增添一支新军
    山东将大种油种子树
    子实含油量与花生相当，比大豆高二倍
    本报讯　山东省农林部门最近发现“油种子树”（一种天然散生的树木，又名“车梁木”，形似杏树，干矮冠大）是一种很好的木本油料树种，果实的果肉和籽仁含有丰富的油质。据山东省粮食厅化验，子实含油量与花生相当，比大豆高二倍。油种子树，主要分布在昌潍、淄博两个专区，其中益都、临朐、博山等县较多，临沂、济南、烟台等地也有少量生长。当地群众曾用这种种籽榨油，最高出油率达到35％以上，榨出的油先绿后黄，质量不次于豆油和花生油。益都县朱崖人民公社南后峪等村，有80％的农户全年食用这种油；五里公社刘格庄村有四十多株油种子树，1957年采种二千七百多斤，出油量等于全村全年的食油供应量。
    油种子树适于在青石山和微碱性土壤上生长。据群众反映，栽到土质较好的地里，六、七年可以长十多厘米粗，结种子二十斤左右；五十年以后，胸高直径能达到五十到六十厘米，每株能结种子三百斤以上。五里公社关阴生产队生长在梯田缘石缝里的一株二十五年生树，胸径达二十厘米，每年能产种子四十斤。这个村的种植方法有两种：第一种办法是利用油种子树萌芽力较强的特性，将大树砍掉，利用根部萌生的幼条抚育成树，当年能长五至六市尺；第二种办法是用种子繁殖，据益都县苗圃和五里公社前进生产队1955年育苗试验，发芽成活率在90％以上（育苗前必须把种子外层的油质去净，否则不易发芽）。
    油种子树的木质坚硬，纹理细致，可做车轴和农具把、柄等。它的新鲜枝条可以燃火，证明油种子树的枝、干也含有油质。
    中共山东省委和省人民委员会很重视利用油种子树榨油，认为这种树是今后取得食用油的重要树种之一。省委已发出通知，要求各地积极种植这种树木；有油种子树的地区，要加强保护和培育母树，并采取措施把今年采摘的树种全部保留下来，以便大量育苗推广。
    山东省自1959年冬天开始大抓木本油料生产，计划在1962年内，全省发展木本油料树十亿五千万株（包括核桃、花椒和油种子树等），争取在十年后木本油料产油达到食用自给。
