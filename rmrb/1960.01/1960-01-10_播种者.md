    The Sower
    By our correspondent Shao Quan
    Late at night, the workshop became even more lively. A large group of workers surrounded a radial drilling machine. Among them, a thin young man in his twenties was helping an old fitter install a specially shaped drill bit on the drilling machine. As the old fitter turned the handle, the drill bit spun rapidly, plunging into the thick steel material. Steel shavings flew as the drill bit pierced through the steel. The old fitter brushed away the debris on the steel material, reached into the smooth and round drilled hole with his finger, and couldn't help but laugh, saying to the thin young man:
    "What a fast drill bit! In the past, when we used ordinary standard drill bits to process this kind of part, it would take thirty seconds to drill one hole. Everyone wanted to shorten the time, but the drill bit would burn out if we increased the speed. Now, using this 'Ni Zhifu drill bit,' it only takes nine seconds!" "If you increase the feed rate a little more, it will be even faster." The thin young man who spoke was none other than Ni Zhifu, a fitter from the Yongding Machinery Factory. That evening, he came to the Beijing Crane Factory to "sow seeds," explaining his advanced experience, the "Ni Zhifu drill bit," to the workers. The workers were enthusiastic and skillful, and many of them learned how to sharpen the drill bit on the spot. The drill bit used just now was sharpened by the workers in the factory themselves. Seeing the seeds blossom and the efficiency double, Ni Zhifu looked at the shiny drill bit and then at the joyful workers, as if a farmer seeing the seeds he sowed sprout, unable to suppress the joy in his heart.
    Ni Zhifu has experienced this joy of being a "sower" more than once. These days, in order to spread advanced experience, his footprints have covered more than twenty large and small machinery factories in the city. Originally, after hearing the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the deeds of heroes from all over the country at the National Congress of Heroes, he was eager to fly back to the factory immediately and work with the workers to further revolutionize technology. But after the congress, the leaders gave him another important task: to turn his creation into the wealth of all the workers in the city in the shortest possible time. When the secretary of the factory's Party committee sent him out of the factory, he patted him on the shoulder and said: "Zhifu, always remember: one flower does not make a spring, a spring of a hundred purples and a thousand reds is true spring!" The workers in the same team shook his hand tightly and said: "Master Ni, don't worry, we will do your work for you, and guarantee to exceed the quota! We just hope that you can send the advanced experience to the brother factories as soon as possible."
    Hearing the earnest instructions of the leaders and partners, Ni Zhifu felt warm in his heart and secretly made up his mind: "I will not come back to see you until the advanced experience is spread throughout the city!"
    The Party always attaches great importance to the creations of the workers. In order to promote the "Ni Zhifu drill bit," a city-wide training class was specially organized, and more than seventy factories sent outstanding workers to learn from him. At the same time, an advanced experience promotion team was established to promote his and others' advanced experiences. His experience and the geometric shape of the drill bit had already been printed into more than a thousand copies of pamphlets and distributed to various factories. Ni Zhifu traveled day and night from one factory to another, explaining and demonstrating again and again, wishing he could take out everything in his heart and give it to everyone. When promoting experience, he met again with his old friend, Tong Maoxuan, a seventh-grade fitter from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, whom he had met in June last year. In the past, Ni Zhifu had taught him to learn the "Ni Zhifu drill bit" three times, and now that the drill bit had been newly improved, he was teaching him for the fourth time.
    "Master Tong, the improved drill bit has these characteristics." Ni Zhifu held a sharpened drill bit in his hand and explained it to Tong Maoxuan repeatedly. Then he personally demonstrated and sharpened a drill bit.
    "See if I grind it right." Tong Maoxuan walked to the grinder and, following Ni Zhifu's grinding pattern, began to grind.
    A string of purple-red sparks burst out from the grinder. Ni Zhifu, who was watching from the side, suddenly grabbed Tong Maoxuan's hands: "Master Tong, you are grinding too far off, it should be like this, like this..., that's right!"
    When teaching workers in brother factories how to sharpen drill bits, he was very strict with himself; he never gave up until the workers had fully mastered this technique. In a brother factory, he found that some workers grind drill bits with the chisel edge angle either too large or too small. "The chisel edge angle should be fifty-five degrees, so that the drill bit is most labor-saving." He told the workers his experience. But he suddenly asked himself again: "Why is it most labor-saving when it is ground to fifty-five degrees?" He did not yet understand the theoretical explanation, but he felt that he must explain this point clearly to everyone in order to promote it more quickly.
    That day, he left the factory and went straight to the Xinhua Bookstore instead of returning to his residence. Next to the tall bookshelves in the bookstore, he turned through various technical books for a long time. When he came out with a book called "Metal Cutting Principles," it was already dark. Back at his residence, he turned on the light and opened "Metal Cutting Principles" and read in a low voice. Gradually, his eyes lit up. "Ah! That's how it is! When the chisel edge angle is around fifty-five degrees, it is precisely when the axial torsional moment is the smallest, so it is particularly labor-saving." He understood all this as if he had realized something.
    The next day, the workers he came into contact with also understood this principle.
    The workers' spirit of research is truly great. Ni Zhifu encountered many difficult problems in various factories every day. But not only did he not feel embarrassed, but he felt happy. The experience of the technical innovation movement told him that the emergence of a new difficult problem meant the emergence of a new production potential. In order to better solve these problems, no matter how busy he was during the day, or how long the meeting was at night, he would read and study under the lamp for a long time every night before going to bed. He said to himself: A sower should study hard in order to better help others.
    He regards those workers who are learning his advanced experience as the best teachers. He often recalls the process of creating and improving the "Ni Zhifu drill bit." Last year's "Ni Zhifu drill bit" was not in its current shape. When he traveled across most of China to spread experience, he absorbed the experience of Shanghai, Hunan and other places, and then improved it to its current appearance. From that time on, he deeply understood that one person's experience is always limited, and everyone's experience is the richest. Therefore, whenever he encounters difficult problems, he always feels that this is a good opportunity for him to learn, like a primary school student, and always asks the veteran masters to discuss and study together. In late November, he came to the Broadcasting Equipment Factory. An old worker said to him: "Master Ni, we have a lot of work in our factory that involves processing brass and copper. How should the drill bit be sharpened to make it easier to use?" Ni Zhifu did not have much experience in processing non-ferrous metals. He humbly said to the old worker: "Master, I don't have any experience with this problem. What do you think are the characteristics of brass and copper?" While the old worker answered this question, other workers also enthusiastically gathered around and discussed it, each saying a word. Based on his own research on drill bits, Ni Zhifu finally found a rule with the workers: compared with brass and copper, brass has greater hardness but less toughness, while copper is just the opposite. Therefore, when processing brass, the cutting edge of the drill bit's rake face should be sharpened a little more dull; when processing copper, it should be sharpened sharper... After Ni Zhifu and the workers worked out this rule, he immediately brought this experience to the workers of the Agricultural Machinery Factory and the Third Machine Tool Factory.
    Relying on the wisdom of the workers of brother factories and his own experience, more than forty new major technical problems that Ni Zhifu encountered in the process of promoting the drill bit were successfully solved in this way. And the workers he taught became new "sowers," bringing his advanced experience to the broader masses of workers. In just over a month, the seeds of the "Ni Zhifu drill bit" were sown all over Beijing. (Attached picture)

    播种者
    本报记者　邵泉
    夜深了，车间里倒更加热闹起来。一大群工人，把一台摇臂钻床围得水泄不通。人群当中，一位二十多岁瘦瘦的青年人，正在帮助一个老钳工把一个形状特别的钻头，安在钻床上。只看老钳工扳动手柄，钻头急速旋转起来，一下子扎进了厚厚的钢料，钢屑飞处，钻头早已把钢料穿透了。老钳工拂掉钢料上的碎屑，用手指伸进又光又圆的钻孔里摸了摸，不由得呵呵笑了起来，对瘦瘦的青年人说：
    “好快的钻头！过去我们用普通标准钻头加工这种零件，要三十秒钟才能钻一个孔，大伙想缩短时间，可是一加大转速，钻头就烧坏了。现在用这把‘倪志福钻头’，只用了九秒钟！”“走刀量再加大一点还能更快。”说话的瘦瘦的青年人，正是永定机械厂的钳工倪志福。这天晚上，他到北京起重机器厂来“播种”，给工人们讲解他的先进经验“倪志福钻头”，工人们热情高涨，心灵手巧，当场很多人就学会了磨制钻头的方法。刚才使用的钻头，就是厂里工人自己磨制的。眼看种子开了花，效率提高两倍。倪志福望着亮晶晶的钻头，又望了望满堂欢喜的工人们，好像庄稼人看见自己播的种子发了芽一样，抑制不住心头的高兴。
    倪志福体验这种“播种者”的喜悦，已经不止一次了。这些日子，为了传播先进经验，他的足迹踏遍了全市二十几个大大小小的机械厂。本来，在全国群英会上，他听到党中央的指示和各地英雄的事迹之后，憋足了劲头，巴不得立刻飞回厂去，和工人们一起进一步大闹技术革命。但是群英会结束以后，领导上交给他另一个紧要任务：要在最短时间内，把自己的创造变成全市工人的财富。工厂党委书记把他送出厂的时候，拍着他的肩膀说：“志福啊，要时刻记着：一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红才是春！”同班组的工人紧握着他的手说：“倪师傅，你放心吧，你的活我们大家替你做，而且保证超额！就盼你早日把先进经验送到兄弟厂去。”
    听了领导同志和伙伴们殷切的嘱咐，倪志福心里热乎乎的，暗暗地下了决心：“不把先进经验传遍全市，不回来见你们！”
    党对工人们的创造，总是十分重视的。为了推广“倪志福钻头”，专门举办了全市性的训练班，七十多个工厂都派来优秀的工人向他学习。同时还成立了先进经验推广队，推广他的和其他人的先进经验。他的经验和钻头的几何形状，也早已被印成一千多份小册子，散发到各个工厂去了。倪志福不分日夜地从一个工厂走到另一个工厂，一次又一次地讲解着，表演着，恨不能把心里的一切都掏出来交给大家。在推广经验的时候，他和去年6月间就相识的老朋友，北京农业机械厂的七级钳工佟茂宣又见面了。过去，倪志福曾经三次教他学习“倪志福钻头”，在钻头有了新的改进以后，现在他又第四次教他了。
    “佟师傅，改进以后的钻头有这样一些特点。”倪志福手拿着一个磨好的钻头，反复向佟茂宣讲解着。然后又亲自表演，并且磨制了一个钻头。
    “你看我磨的对不对。”佟茂宣走到沙轮面前，照着倪志福磨的样子，磨了起来。
    沙轮上，迸出一串紫红色的火花。站在旁边观看的倪志福，忽然把住了佟茂宣的两手：“佟师傅，您磨得太偏了些，应该这样，这样……，对了！”
    在教兄弟厂工人学习磨制钻头的时候，他对自己的要求是很严格的；当工人们没有完全掌握这种技术以前，他从不泄气。在一个兄弟厂，他发现有些工人磨制的钻头，横刃斜角不是太大就是太小，“横刃的斜角应该是五十五度，这样的钻头才最省劲。”他把自己的经验告诉工人们。但是他心里忽然又反问起自己来：“为什么磨成五十五度才最省劲呢？”他还不懂得理论的解释，但是他感到，一定要和大家讲清这一点，才能更快地推广。
    这天，他从工厂出来，不回住所，却一直往新华书店走去。在书店高大的书架旁，他长久地翻着各种技术书籍。当他带着一本“金属切削原理”走出来的时候，天已黑下来了。回到住所，他拉开电灯，翻开“金属切削原理”小声读了起来。渐渐地，他的眼睛亮了。“啊！原来这么回事！横刃角度在五十五度左右的时候，正是轴扭转力矩最小的时候，所以特别省劲。”他若有所悟地弄懂了这一切。
    第二天，他所接触到的工人，也都懂得了这个道理。
    工人们的钻研精神可真大。倪志福每天在各工厂都碰到许多疑难问题。但是他不但不感到为难，反而觉得高兴。技术革新运动的经验告诉他：出现了一个新的疑难问题，就意味着出现了一个新的生产潜力。为了更好地解决这些问题，不管白天事情怎样忙，或者晚上开会时间多么长，在每天临睡以前，他都在灯下长久地看书和钻研。他对自己说：一个播种者，应该刻苦地学习，才能更好地帮助别人。
    他把那些正在学习他的先进经验的工人们当作最好的老师。他常常回忆起自己创造和改进“倪志福钻头”的过程。去年的“倪志福钻头”，还不是像现在这样的形状，他走遍大半个中国传播经验的时候，吸收了上海、湖南等地的经验，才改进成现在这个样子。从那个时候起，他就深深地懂得，一个人的经验总是有限的，大家的经验才是最丰富的。因此每当他遇到疑难问题，他总是像小学生一样，感到这正是自己学习的好机会，总是请老师傅们一块来商量研究。11月下旬，他来到了广播器材厂。一位老工人对他说：“倪师傅，我们厂里加工黄铜和紫铜的活很多，钻头应该怎样磨才好使呢？”倪志福对于加工有色金属的经验还不多。他虚心地向老工人说：“老师傅，这个问题我没有什么经验，您看黄铜和紫铜有什么特性？”在老工人回答这个问题的时候，别的工人也热情地围了过来，你一言我一语地研究起来。倪志福根据自己对钻头的研究，终于和工人们一起找出了一个规律：黄铜和紫铜比较，黄铜的硬度比较大，但是韧性比较小，紫铜却刚刚相反。因此，在加工黄铜的时候，钻头正前角的切削刃要磨得钝一点；加工紫铜的时候，就要磨得锐利一点……在倪志福和工人们研究出这个规律后，他立刻又把这个经验带给了农业机械厂和第三机床厂的工人们。
    依靠了兄弟厂工人的智慧和他自己的经验，倪志福在推广钻头过程中碰到的四十多个新的重大技术问题，就都这样胜利地解决了。而他所教会的工人，又成为新的“播种者”，把他的先进经验带给更广大的工人群众，短短一个多月的时间，“倪志福钻头”的种子，就撒遍了北京市全市。（附图片）
