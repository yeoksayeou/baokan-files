Local Newspaper Commentary Abstract:

    Technological Innovation is Endless
    Is there a limit to technological innovation? For example, is the task of technological innovation completed with the transition from manual operation to mechanization? Have some units already reached the peak of technological innovation because they have mechanized production? Some workers and masses still do not understand or do not fully understand these questions. It should be said that the potential for technological innovation and technological revolution is inexhaustible. Because human understanding of the laws of nature is constantly developing, and production technology is also constantly developing, no production technology achievement is final, and none has reached its peak. This new achievement in production technology is a step forward compared to the past, and at the same time opens up new avenues for future development, along which it can continue to develop. Every innovation and every reform in production technology raises labor productivity a step further, and human social productivity develops endlessly in this way. Therefore, technological innovation and technological revolution have become a broad road for our continuous leap forward in production.
    At present, in the industrial production, transportation, and capital construction sectors of the Xi'an area, in order to develop at a high speed and implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, it is necessary to continue to greatly improve labor productivity through technological innovation and technological revolution. We should see the fact that a large part of the production processes in many factories are still manual operations, and some that can be mechanized or semi-mechanized have not yet been done. Although some factories are semi-mechanized, they still need to move towards mechanization and automation. The handling and loading and unloading in capital construction construction and transportation have not completely eliminated heavy physical labor such as carrying on shoulders, etc. This presents our broad masses of workers with very extensive topics for technological innovation and technological revolution. We should establish the idea of ​​continuous revolution with no end to innovation, from small to large, from low to high, from simple to complex, from indigenous to foreign, using foreign methods where possible, using indigenous methods where foreign methods are unavailable, and combining foreign and indigenous methods. Resolutely implement the "walking on two legs" policy proposed by the Party. As long as we adhere to this policy, establish lofty aspirations, and set great ambitions, we will be able to continuously achieve new achievements in technological innovation and technological revolution, thereby establishing a new routine of continuous leap forward in production.

### 技术革新无止境

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    技术革新无止境
    技术革新是不是有一定的限度？譬如说，由手工操作到机械化，技术革新的任务是不是就完成了？某些单位已经是机械化生产了，是不是技术革新就已经到顶了？这些问题，在一部分职工群众中间还不了解或不够了解。应当说，技术革新和技术革命的潜力是取之不尽，用之不竭的。因为人类对于自然界规律的认识是不断发展的，生产技术也在不断发展，任何一种生产技术成就都不是最后的，都不是已经发展到顶点了；这种生产技术上的新成就，是比过去进了一步，也同时为今后发展开辟了新的道路，顺着这条道路还可以继续不断地向前发展。生产技术上的每一项革新、每一次革新，都使劳动生产率提高一步，人类社会生产力也就这样永无止境地发展下去。因此，技术革新和技术革命，就成为我们生产持续跃进的一条康庄大道。
    目前，在西安地区工业生产、交通运输、基本建设等方面，要高速度发展，要贯彻多快好省的方针，就必须继续不断地通过技术革新和技术革命来大大地提高劳动生产率。我们应当看到这样一个事实；有不少工厂的大部分生产工序还是手工操作，有些可以机械化或半机械化的还没有做到；有些工厂虽然半机械化了，还需要向机械化、自动化方向迈进，基本建设施工和交通运输中的搬运装卸等方面还没有完全消灭肩挑人抬等重体力劳动，等等，这就给我们广大职工提出了非常广泛的技术革新和技术革命的课题。我们应当树立革新无止境的不断革命的思想，由小到大，由低到高，由简到繁，由土到洋，能洋则洋，无洋则土，洋土并举。坚决贯彻党所提出来的“两条腿走路的方针”。只要我们坚持这个方针，树雄心，立大志，我们就能够在技术革新和技术革命中不断取得新的成就，从而建立不断跃进的生产新常规。　　（摘自西安日报）
