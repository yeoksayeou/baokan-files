	All the Best Things Are the Most Satisfying
	Fang Ping
	The red sun shines brightly, the red flag rises,
	Leap forward gongs and drums welcome the New Year,
	Red lanterns shine in front of every house,
	Smiles are on everyone's face.
	Public canteens arrange grand banquets,
	Fish, meat, and dumplings are fragrant.
	Thousands of cities and tens of thousands of communes are lively,
	Let's raise our glasses together and pour the wine.
	One cup of victory wine,
	Fill it to the brim;
	Respected Chairman Mao,
	We will follow you!
	You are the red sun shining in the sky,
	Shining across the country with spring!
	Two cups of victory wine,
	Fill it to the brim;
	Towards the beloved Party,
	We express our determination,
	The Party is our dear parent,
	Our hearts are with the Party!
	Three cups of victory wine,
	Fill it to the brim;
	Let's sing aloud,
	Sing out the heart of a hero;
	Sing loudly of the Communist Party,
	Sing loudly of the Great Leap Forward!
	The red sun shines brightly, the red flag rises,
	Leap forward gongs and drums welcome the New Year,
	Welcome the New Year, boost morale,
	All the best things are the most satisfying!

    万紫千红最称心
    放平
    红日高照红旗升，
    跃进锣鼓迎新春，
    家家门前红灯亮，
    人人脸上笑盈盈。
    公共食堂排盛宴，
    鱼肉饺子香喷喷。
    千城万社多热闹，
    共举酒杯把酒斟。
    一杯胜利酒，
    满满地斟；
    敬爱的毛主席，
    咱们跟着您！
    您是红日当空照，
    照得全国都是春！
    二杯胜利酒，
    满满地斟；
    向着亲爱的党，
    咱们表决心，
    党是咱们的亲父母，
    咱们和党一条心！
    三杯胜利酒，
    满满地斟；
    咱们高声唱，
    唱出英雄的心；
    高声歌唱共产党，
    高声歌唱大跃进！
    红日高照红旗升，
    跃进锣鼓迎新春，
    迎新春，鼓干劲，
    万紫千红最称心！
