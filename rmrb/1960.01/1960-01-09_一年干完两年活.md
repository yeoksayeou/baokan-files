New Year's Aspirations

    Complete Two Years' Work in One Year
    Although I am currently working on the tasks for 1964, I am still far from meeting the requirements of the Party and the demands of the developing new situation. The situation urgently requires us to tap the existing transportation potential and vigorously meet the needs of the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production for transportation.
    The new year has begun. I will certainly listen to the Party's words, continue to make persistent efforts, and continue to advance along the great goal indicated by the Party. I will strengthen automobile maintenance, improve operational efficiency, and ensure that the average vehicle integrity rate reaches 99%, guaranteeing the completion of two years' work in 1960.

    一年干完两年活
    目前我虽然已在干1964年的工作，可是与党的要求、与新形势发展的要求还相差很远。形势迫切要求我们挖掘现有运输潜力，大力满足工农业生产继续跃进对交通运输的需要。
    新的一年开始了，我一定听党的话，再接再厉，沿着党所指示的伟大目标继续前进。我要加强汽车保养，提高运行效能，使车辆完好率平均达到99％，保证1960年内干完两年的活。
