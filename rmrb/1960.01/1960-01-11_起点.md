    Starting Point
    The fact that vehicle and tool factories in Tianjin are rushing to produce handcarts to support rural transportation is a good thing.

    Compared to modern transportation tools like tractors and automobiles, handcarts are a relatively backward tool; however, compared to carrying on shoulders and human labor, they are relatively advanced.

    The fundamental goal of agricultural technological transformation is to establish China's agriculture on a modern technical foundation. Currently, China's various modern agricultural tools are constantly increasing. Due to the weak foundation of agricultural machinery in the past, modern agricultural machinery still falls far short of meeting needs. This requires that while massively producing modern agricultural tools and machinery, we must also develop some "native," simple tools that can quickly improve work efficiency. The handcart is an indispensable "leg" in the two-legged approach to agricultural technological transformation.

    Handcarts have their characteristics. First, they are light and nimble, and can travel on the narrowest roads. Second, they can reduce labor, save manpower, and improve transportation efficiency. Third, they don't cost much and are simple to manufacture. As long as you have ball bearings and rubber wheels, ordinary carpenters can make them.

    There are also people who look down on the role of handcarts, and they give it a label of backwardness as soon as they mention it. This is unfair. In the past, commune members of the Chengguan People's Commune in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, could only carry or bear over a hundred catties of goods at a time with a full male labor force. After using handcarts, a female labor force can transport two to three hundred catties of goods at a time. May I ask: Under the existing conditions, what tool is more convenient and cost-effective than a handcart?

    We cannot casually put a "backward" label on handcarts. In some places, it should also be regarded as a "starting point" for the technological transformation of rural transportation. Starting from here, from simple to complex, and then further towards semi-mechanization and mechanization.

    起点
    天津市各车辆车具工厂赶制手推车，支援农村运输，是件好事。
    手推车比起拖拉机、汽车等现代运输工具，是属于落后的一种工具；但是比起肩挑人抬，它又是比较先进的。
    农业技术改造的根本目的，是把我国农业建立在现代化的技术基础上。目前，我国各种现代化的农业工具正在不断增长。由于原来农业机械的基础薄弱，现代化的农械还远远不能满足需要，这就要求在大规模生产现代化农具、农械的同时，还要搞一些“土”的、简易的而且能迅速提高工效的工具。手推车就是农业技术改造中两条腿走路不可缺少的“一条腿”。
    手推车有它的特点。第一，轻便、灵巧，可以在最窄狭的道路上行驶；第二，可以减轻劳动，节省人力，提高运输效率；第三，花钱不多，制造简单，只要有了滚珠、胶轮，普通木匠都能配制。
    还有人看不起手推车的作用，他们一提起手推车就给它带上落后的帽子，这是不公平的。河北省吴桥县城关人民公社的社员们，过去一个男全劳动力一次只能肩挑或背负一百多斤东西；改用手推车后，一个妇女劳动力就能一次运二、三百斤东西。请问：在现有条件下，哪有比手推车这种工具更加方便合算呢？
    不能轻率地给手推车扣上一顶“落后”帽子。在某些地方还应当把它看做农村运输技术改造的一个“起点”，从这里出发，由简到繁，再进一步走向半机械化机械化。
