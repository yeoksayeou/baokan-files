A: I've discovered that all sons are born from their parents.
B: Everyone knows that!
A: That is to say, the vast majority of fathers are older than their sons.
B: Are there a few exceptions?
A: Of course, it's possible.
B: I've never seen it.
A: Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it can't exist? I think you lack a historical, scientific, and developmental perspective in how you look at things...
B: I ask you, who is younger than his son?
A: Of course there is, like Sun Wukong, for example.
B: What a historical perspective, what Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie...
A: Hey, I didn't mention Zhu Bajie.
B: You did mention Sun Wukong.
A: That's right, according to my research, Sun Wukong might be younger than his son.
B: I know that too, Sun Wukong can transform!
A: It's not because he can transform, but because he can somersault.
B: That's new, why don't I see circus performers younger than their sons?
A: Because they don't somersault as fast as Sun Wukong.
B: That's true, who doesn't know he somersaults 108,000 li in one flip.
A: The secret is here. How many somersaults do you think he can do in a second?
B: I think two or three wouldn't be a problem.
A: If he takes a trip to the Milky Way,
B: I don't think it would take him a day.
A: But guess how much time has passed on Earth when he returns?
B: Also a day!
A: No, Earth has passed at least twenty years.
B: Yo, doesn't that mean one day equals twenty years?
A: He'll be younger than his son when he comes back.
B: I don't believe it, did the clocks on Earth speed up?
A: No, the clock on Sun Wukong slowed down.
B: Why would his clock slow down?
A: Because the clock is on Sun Wukong.
B: If it's on me, why wouldn't it slow down?
A: You're not somersaulting. Because Sun Wukong is moving very fast, the clock on him slows down.
B: Are you saying that time passes slower for people who move very fast?!
A: Exactly. And the faster he goes, the slower time passes.
B: Sun Wukong is a mythical figure, no one has experimented with that.
A: Of course people have experimented, and it can be calculated. For example, taking a Tu-114 plane.
B: Wow, that plane is very fast!
A: Its speed is 1,000 kilometers per hour. If you sit on this plane for ten hours, then the Earth will pass ten hours more.
B: How much more!
A: Three hundred millionths of a second.
B: How can you feel such a short amount of time?
A: Don't worry, aren't our Soviet big brothers launching artificial satellites, space rockets, and heavy Earth satellite rockets, not to mention interstellar spaceships and photon rockets in the future...
B: What a developmental perspective!
A: Take the photon rocket, for example. Its speed is close to the speed of light, thirty kilometers per second.
B: Good grief, faster than Sun Wukong.
A: If someone takes a trip to interstellar space in this kind of rocket and comes back,
B: He'll be younger than his grandson.
A: No, his grandson will have died long ago. At least a few thousand years will have passed on Earth.
B: Wouldn't he become a historical old man?
A: He wouldn't be old, he'd only be a year older.
B: If you fly at the speed of light?
A: Then he will be immortal and eternally young.
B: What if you exceed the speed of light?
A: I said you need to have a scientific viewpoint. Exceeding the speed of light is impossible.
B: I don't understand. Time passes so slowly on him, can he stand it?
A: He's used to it. Not only does time slow down, but all the movements around him slow down, like his metabolism slows down. You don't feel hungry even if you don't eat for three days.
B: Isn't that saving!
A: Also, cell growth, brain activity, pulse, blood circulation, heartbeat, everything slows down.
B: That's not bad, I can go to a sanatorium for my heart disease. With all that being said, I've decided to go on an interstellar trip right away.
A: Great, the spaceship to Altair is about to take off.
B: Then I have to hurry.
A: Wait a minute, you have to tell your loved one.

    一天等于二十年（科学相声）

    甲：我发现儿子都是父母生的。
    乙：这谁不知道？！
    甲：也就是说，绝大多数父亲都比儿子年老。
    乙：那还有少数例外吗？
    甲：当然可能。
    乙：我没见过。
    甲：你没见过就不兴有吗？我看你看问题就是缺乏历史的、科学的、发展的眼光……
    乙：我问你，谁比他儿子年青？
    甲：当然有，就比方说孙悟空吧。
    乙：好一个历史眼光，什么孙悟空、猪八戒……
    甲：喂，我可没说猪八戒呵。
    乙：孙悟空总是你说的。
    甲：对，根据我的考证，孙悟空就可能比他儿子年青。
    乙：这个我也知道，孙悟空会变?！
    甲：不是因为他会变，而是因为他会翻斤斗。
    乙：真新鲜，我怎么没有看见杂技团演员都比他儿子年青呢？
    甲：因为他们没有孙悟空翻的快。
    乙：这话倒实在，他一斤斗翻十万八千里谁不知道。
    甲：秘密就在这里，你说他一秒钟能翻多少个斤斗？
    乙：我看两三个不成问题。
    甲：要是他到银河去走一趟，
    乙：我看用不了一天。
    甲：可是你猜他一回地球，地球上过了多少时间？
    乙：也是一天呀！
    甲：不，地球最少过了二十年。
    乙：哟，这不是一天等于二十年?。
    甲：他回来就比他儿子年青了。
    乙：我不相信，难道地球上的钟表走快了吗？
    甲：不，是孙悟空身上的表走慢了。
    乙：为什么他的表会走慢呢？
    甲：因为表在孙悟空身上。
    乙：放在我身上，怎么不会慢呢？
    甲：你又没有在翻斤斗，因为孙悟空走得非常快，所以他身上的表就走得慢些。
    乙：照你这样说，时间在速度非常快的人身上就会过得慢些？！
    甲：一点不错。而且他速度愈快，时间就过得愈慢。
    乙：孙悟空是神话里的人物，谁也没有实验过。
    甲：当然有人实验过，并且可以算得出。比方说，坐图一一四飞机。
    乙：嗬，这飞机速度很快呀！
    甲：它的速度是每小时一千公里。要是你在这飞机上坐十小时，那地球就得过十个小时多。
    乙：多多少呀！
    甲：三万万分之一秒。
    乙：这么短的时间怎么觉得出。
    甲：你别着急?，现在苏联老大哥不是发射了人造卫星、宇宙火箭和重型地球卫星火箭吗，再    说将来还有星际飞船、光子火箭……
    乙：好一个发展眼光！
    甲：就说光子火箭吧，它的速度接近光速，每秒三十公里。
    乙：好家伙，比孙悟空还快。
    甲：要是有人坐这种火箭到星际旅行一趟回来，
    乙：他准比他孙子还年青。
    甲：不，孙子早死了，地球至少过了几千年。
    乙：那他不成了历史老人了?。
    甲：他还不老，只长了一岁。
    乙：照你说，要是以光速飞行呢？
    甲：那他就长生不老，永远年青。
    乙：要是超过光速呢？
    甲：我不是说过要有科学的观点?，超过光速是不可能的。
    乙：我不懂，在他身上时间过得那末慢，这受得了吗？
    甲：习惯了?，不仅时间变慢了，他周围的一切运动都变慢了，比如新陈代谢也变慢了，你三    天不吃饭还不觉得饿。
    乙：那不是节约吗！
    甲：还有细胞生长、大脑活动、脉搏跳动、血液循环、心脏跳动一切都变慢了。
    乙：这倒不错，我这个心脏病还可以去疗养疗养。这么一说，我决定马上去星际旅行一趟。
    甲：好呀，现在开往牛郎星的宇宙飞船就要起飞了，
    乙：那我得赶快去。
    甲：慢点，你得跟你爱人说一声。
