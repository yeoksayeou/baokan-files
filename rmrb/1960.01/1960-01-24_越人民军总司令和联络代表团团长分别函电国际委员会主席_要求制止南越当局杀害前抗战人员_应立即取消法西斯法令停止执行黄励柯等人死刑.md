Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 21st. Lieutenant Colonel Liu Wenli, representative of the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, announced at a press conference held today that General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent an urgent telegram today to Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission in Vietnam, regarding the South Vietnamese Special Military Court's sentencing on December 19, 1959, of six former resistance personnel, including Vu Van Cong and Ngo Quang Thanh, to death and long-term hard labor, citing the "1959 No. 10" fascist decree for the so-called "murder of American advisors in Bien Hoa Province."

The telegram pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities' sentencing of the aforementioned former resistance personnel "grossly violates Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords."

The telegram said, "This decree tramples on ordinary legal principles and the basic rights to life. Its purpose is to brutally suppress the struggle movement in South Vietnam of those who love their country, love peace, and oppose American imperialism and its running dogs."

The telegram pointed out, "This case, and all cases judged by the Saigon Special Military Court, prove that the purpose of the 1959 No. 10 decree is to massacre former resistance personnel in order to implement the American imperialist policy of intervention and war in South Vietnam."

In the telegram, Vo Nguyen Giap once again requested the International Commission to intervene and force the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately revoke this fascist 1959 No. 10 decree, disband the Saigon Special Military Court, and reverse all cases judged by this court, first and foremost halting the execution of Hoang Le Kha, Hoang Van Kiem, Vu Van Cong, Ngo Quang Thanh, Nguyen Van Nhan, and others, in order to save their lives.

At the press conference, Lieutenant Colonel Liu Wenli also introduced the truth of the "Bien Hoa case" to the domestic and foreign journalists present, and sternly refuted the South Vietnamese authorities' lie that the 1959 No. 10 decree did not violate the Geneva Accords. He pointed out that the Geneva Accords stipulate that there shall be no retaliation or discrimination against former resistance personnel, while the South Vietnamese authorities' decree and so-called "policy towards former resistance personnel" are tools used to suppress and retaliate against former resistance personnel. This is obviously a very serious violation of the Geneva Accords.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 22nd. It was announced here today that Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent a letter to Ansari, Chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam, on January 18th, strongly protesting the South Vietnamese authorities' Special Military Court's sentencing of six former resistance personnel to death and life imprisonment on fabricated charges.

On December 19th of last year, the South Vietnamese Special Military Court in Bien Hoa Province sentenced six former resistance personnel, including Ngo Quang Thanh, Vu Van Cong, Nguyen Van Nhan, and Vu Van Chang, to death and long-term imprisonment on fabricated charges of "murdering American advisors" and "treason."

In the letter, Ha Van Lau emphasized that this case blatantly violates Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords.

The letter stated that Ngo Quang Thanh and others were all members of the Resistance Administrative Committee and members of the National Salvation Association during the Anti-Japanese War. After the restoration of peace, they all lived normal lives at home.

The letter stated that these people have nothing to do with the attack on American military advisors that occurred in Bien Hoa Province on July 8, 1959. Some of them, such as Vu Van Cong, were even arrested in 1955.

The letter stated that the South Vietnamese Special Military Court, unable to find sufficient evidence to impose the "murder" charge on the defendants, groundlessly sentenced them for "treason." This shows that the South Vietnamese authorities are doing everything possible to sentence and kill these former resistance personnel in order to please American warmongers.

The People's Army Liaison Delegation requested the International Commission to force the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately revoke this illegal judgment, conduct an investigation into this serious violation of the Geneva Accords as soon as possible, and first and foremost halt the South Vietnamese authorities' execution of the sentences of death against Ngo Quang Thanh and two others to save the innocent victims.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 22nd. In a recent letter to the International Commission, the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army revealed that in the past three years, due to cruel treatment in the Con Dao prison on the east coast of South Vietnam, 2,174 former resistance personnel have died unnaturally. The lives of the 4,051 people still detained there are in serious danger.

The Liaison Delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army wrote a letter to the International Commission condemning the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities for mistreating and brutally torturing those detained in this largest concentration camp.

The letter revealed that many of those detained were survivors of the poisoning massacre at the Phu Loi concentration camp in December 1958. Almost all of them have not been subjected to any court trials. Inhumane torture has crippled or mentally deranged most of the detainees. Due to prolonged malnutrition, all detainees, without exception, suffer from various diseases such as tuberculosis, dysentery, beriberi, malaria, and paralysis.

In addition, detainees have to work ten hours, or even twelve hours, every day. The letter said that they not only need to quarry stones and cut down trees, but also go down steep rocks extending into the sea to collect shrimp or gather swallow nests.

The letter also said that people in prison are subjected to electric shock, suspended upside down with heavy objects tied to their bodies, and other tortures every day.

The letter emphasized, "This concentration camp imprisons and mistreats thousands of former resistance personnel simply because they were engaged in resistance activities. This concentration camp is a very serious violation of Article 14(c) of the Geneva Agreements on the cessation of conflict in Vietnam."

The Vietnamese People's Army requested the International Commission to immediately dispatch mobile teams to conduct on-site investigations, and suggested that the South Vietnamese authorities abolish this concentration camp and release the 4,051 people detained there.

    越人民军总司令和联络代表团团长分别函电国际委员会主席
    要求制止南越当局杀害前抗战人员
    应立即取消法西斯法令停止执行黄励柯等人死刑
    新华社河内21日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团代表刘文利中校在今天举行的记者招待会上宣布，越南人民军总司令武元甲大将今天就南越特别军事法庭1959年12月19日援引“1959年第十号”法西斯法令判决所谓“在边和省谋杀美国顾问”的武文孔、吴光清等六名前抗战人员死刑和长期苦役一事，打紧急电报给越南国际委员会主席安萨里。
    电报指出，南越当局对上述前抗战人员的判决“极其粗暴地违反了日内瓦协议第十四条丙款”。
    电报说，“这个法令蹂躏了普通的法理原则，蹂躏了人的基本生活权利，它的目的在于野蛮地镇压南越爱祖国、爱和平、反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争运动”。
    电报指出，“这个案件和西贡特别军事法庭判决过的所有案件证明，1959年第十号法令的目的是：残杀前抗战人员，以实现美帝国主义在南越的干涉和战争政策。”
    武元甲大将在电报中再一次要求国际委员会进行干涉，迫使南越当局立即取消这个法西斯的1959年第十号法令，解散西贡特别军事法庭，并且撤销这个法庭判决过的所有案件，首先停止执行黄励柯、黄文剑、武文孔、吴光清、阮文壤等人的死刑，以拯救他们的生命。
    刘文利中校在记者招待会上还向到会的国内外记者介绍了“边和案件”的真象，并严正地驳斥了南越当局声称1959年第十号法令并没有违反日内瓦协议的谎言。他指出，日内瓦协议规定不得对前抗战人员进行报复和歧视，而南越当局的这项法令和所谓“对前抗战人员的政策”却是用来镇压和报复前抗战人员的工具。这显然是极其严重地违反了日内瓦协议。
    据新华社河内22日电　此间今天公布，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校1月18日写信给越南国际监察和监督委员会主席安萨里，强烈抗议南越当局的特别军事法庭以捏造的罪名判决六名前抗战人员死刑和无期徒刑。
    去年12月19日南越特别军事法庭在边和省以捏造的“谋杀美国顾问”和“叛逆”的罪名判决前抗战人员吴光清、武文孔、阮文壤、武文昌等六人死刑和长期徒刑。
    何文楼在信中强调指出，这个案件明目张胆地违反了日内瓦协议第十四条丙款。
    信中说，吴光清等人在抗战时期都是抗战行政委员会的人员和救国会会员。和平恢复后，他们都在家里过着正常的生活。
    信中说，这些人同1959年7月8日在边和省发生的袭击美国军事顾问的事件完全无关，在他们当中有的人例如武文孔甚至是在1955年就被捕的。
    信中说，南越的特别军事法庭因为找不出充分的证据来给被告强加“谋杀”的罪名，就毫无根据地以“叛逆”为罪名判决，这说明南越当局千方百计地要判决和杀害这些前抗战人员来讨好美国好战分子。
    人民军联络代表团要求国际委员会尽快地迫使南越当局立即撤销这个非法的判决案，对这个严重违反日内瓦协议的行动尽快进行调查，首先是制止南越当局执行判处吴光清等三人死刑的判决案，拯救无辜的受害者。
    新华社河内22日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团最近在给国际委员会的信中揭露，在过去三年中，由于在南越东海岸昆仑岛监狱受到残酷的虐待，已有两千一百七十四个前抗战人员死于非命。现在仍被扣押在那里的四千零五十一人的生命濒临严重的危险。
    越南人民军联络代表团写信给国际委员会谴责吴庭艳当局对拘押在这个最大的集中营里的人进行虐待和野蛮的拷打。
    这封信揭露说，被拘押的许多人是在1958年12月富利集中营食物施毒的大屠杀时死里逃生的。所有的人差不多都没有受到过任何法庭的审讯。毫无人性的拷打使大多数被拘押的人残废或精神失常。由于长时期营养不足，所有被拘押的人无例外地患有结核病、痢疾、脚气、疟疾、瘫痪等各种疾病。
    此外，被拘押者每天得工作十小时，甚至十二小时。信件说，他们不仅需要开石、砍树，而且还要顺着伸向大海的陡峭的岩石去捞虾或采集燕窝。
    信件又说，监狱中每天都有人受电刑、身上缚着重物倒悬起来等酷刑。
    信件着重指出，“这个集中营囚禁了数以千计的前抗战人员，并且加以虐待，不过是因为他们从事过抗战活动。这个集中营极其严重地违反了关于在越南停止冲突的日内瓦协定十四条丙项”。
    越南人民军要求国际委员会应当立即派遣机动小组到现场进行调查，并且建议南越当局撤销这个集中营，释放四千零五十一个被拘押在那里的人。
