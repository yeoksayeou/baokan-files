Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: A correspondent from this agency reports: The impending signing of a military alliance treaty by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries gravely endangers the interests of all Japanese people. An increasingly broad spectrum of Japanese people are rising up to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty" in order to eradicate this new source of trouble for peace and security in Japan and Asia. Currently, this struggle has developed into a surging nationwide movement.

The Japanese working class is the backbone of the Japanese people's struggle. The largest trade union in Japan, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), points out: "The source of the suffering imposed on Japanese workers, the intensification of labor, and the threat of war lies in the political system established under the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty.'" Therefore, Sohyo's movement guidelines explicitly state that the central task is to smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The Kishi Nobusuke government has taken repressive measures against some important trade unions in order to undermine the anti-"Security Treaty" movement. However, the struggle of Japanese workers is becoming more and more resolute. In each national unified action, they take the lead in holding strikes, rallies, demonstrations, etc., resolutely opposing the revision and demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Furthermore, the number of participants in the struggle is the largest in each unified action. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, together with the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other mass organizations, has formed the National Council to Prevent the Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which has played a positive role in promoting the united struggle of democratic forces.

In conjunction with opposing the "Security Treaty," workers in various industrial sectors in Japan have also carried out struggles to safeguard their living rights, such as opposing "enterprise rationalization" and demanding wage increases, and have achieved a series of victories. Among them, the struggle of coal miners against the "enterprise rationalization" plan, which involves massive layoffs, has been the most intense and is a key focus of the Japanese workers' struggle to defend their living rights.

The Japanese workers' movement, centered on opposing the "Security Treaty," has seen tremendous development, and the unity of workers and their cooperation with people from other strata have been significantly enhanced. Riding the wave of victory, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has already decided on a spring struggle plan centered on preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty." This plan stipulates that the General Council will hold longer and more powerful strikes to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty" and to make the scale of the anti-"Security Treaty" struggle wider and wider, with more and more people participating. The plan also stipulates that large-scale demonstrations against the revision of the "Security Treaty" will be held in January and February.

In the formation of the nationwide movement against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, it is of particular importance that Japanese farmers, who are more tightly controlled by conservative political parties, have also stood up to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty" alongside the workers. Japanese farmers' organizations completed their unification last year and established the "Farmers' Liaison Council for Implementing Farmers' Demands and Preventing the Revision of the Security Treaty." Combining demands for higher rice purchase prices and opposition to heavy taxes, Japanese farmers have actively participated in unified actions against the "Security Treaty." Farmers and worker representatives from ten prefectures in the Tohoku and Hokuriku regions have formed the Ten Prefecture Worker-Farmer Joint Struggle Organization. Moreover, such worker-farmer joint organizations are being planned in other regions as well. The National Federation of Farmers' Associations has passed a resolution stating: "Japanese farmers will unite with workers to launch a struggle to prevent the revision of the Security Treaty until the peace, democracy, and independence of Japan can be ensured." Farmers, who make up 40% of Japan's population, are exerting their tremendous potential and acting as allies of the working class. Japanese students and youth have held numerous strikes and demonstrations, actively opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty." They clearly recognize that if the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty" succeeds, they will be in danger of being forced to serve as cannon fodder. Therefore, Japanese youth have issued strong calls: "Don't sell the fresh blood of youth to U.S. imperialism!" "We don't want to die for the United States!" Under the leadership of the "Central Joint Struggle Conference of Youth and Students to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty," Japanese youth and students are actively conducting propaganda against the "Security Treaty."

More than twenty Japanese women's organizations decided to take joint action to oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty" as early as last July. Twelve thousand women and mothers' representatives from all over Japan, regardless of the Kishi Nobusuke government's intimidation and obstruction, held a mothers' conference last August, expressing their opposition to the revision of the "Security Treaty." The conference working committee also issued an appeal to the world saying: "We mothers do not want our husbands and sons to die on the battlefield. We strive to work together with friends all over the world to guarantee the happiness of our children. From this point of view, we must oppose the revision of the 'Security Treaty,' a military alliance that prepares for war."

University professors, writers, painters, actors, lawyers, journalists, religious figures, and people from other broad strata have joined the ranks of the struggle. More than three thousand three hundred people from the cultural field have established two main organizations, one is the "Security Treaty Problem Research Association," which is centered on scientists and philosophers, and the other is the "Security Treaty Criticism Association," which is centered on writers. Prominent figures in academia such as Shigeru Nanbara, Hyoe Ouchi, Hiroshi Suekawa, and Senroku Uehara, as well as other members of these two organizations, have continuously published articles in newspapers and magazines or given speeches in the streets, factories, exposing the dangers of revising the "Security Treaty" to the Japanese people and advocating that Japan take a path of peace and neutrality. One thousand five hundred Japanese lawyers and legal scholars have established the "Conference of Legal Scholars to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty." Based on legal theory, they have demonstrated that the revision of the "Security Treaty" violates the Japanese Constitution and the United Nations Charter. The "Security Treaty" revised by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is illegal because the Japanese people do not recognize the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The National Federation of Small and Medium Enterprise Associations, an organization of 80,000 small and medium-sized enterprise capitalists, decided at its conference in mid-October last year to oppose, together with people from all walks of life, the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" system that hinders the prosperity of their enterprises. They have since participated in national unified actions against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Some local assemblies have also passed resolutions demanding the cessation of the revision of the "Security Treaty." Some insightful people within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan are also dissatisfied with some of Kishi Nobusuke's methods of revising the "Security Treaty."

Now, opposing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and opposing the revival of militarism have become the common calls of all the Japanese people. It is they, and not a handful of willful U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, who will determine the fate of Japan. (Attached pictures)

### 反对日美军事同盟　反对军国主义复活  汹涌澎湃的全民斗争席卷日本

    反对日美军事同盟　反对军国主义复活
    汹涌澎湃的全民斗争席卷日本
    新华社15日讯　本社记者报道：美日反动派即将签订的军事同盟条约严重危害日本全体人民的利益，越来越广泛的日本各阶层人民都奋起反对修改“安全条约”，来铲除这个日本和亚洲的和平和安全的新祸根。现在，这一斗争已经发展为汹涌澎湃的全民性运动。
    日本工人阶级是日本人民斗争中的中坚力量。日本最大的工会——日本工会总评议会指出：“强加在日本工人身上的痛苦、加强劳动强度和战争威胁的根源，都在于根据日美‘安全条约’建立的政治制度”。因此，总评议会的运动方针明确规定以粉碎日美“安全条约”为中心。岸信介政府为了破坏反对“安全条约”运动，对一些重要的工会采取了镇压措施。但是，日本工人的斗争越来越坚决。他们在每次全国统一行动中都率先举行罢工、集会、示威等，坚决反对修改并且要求废除日美“安全条约”，而且参加斗争的人数在每次统一行动中都是最多的。日本工会总评议会和共产党、社会党以及其他群众团体共同组成了阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，在促进民主力量的联合斗争方面起了积极的作用。
    结合反对“安全条约”，日本各产业部门的工人还进行了反对“企业合理化”、要求增加工资等维护生活权利的斗争，并取得了一系列的胜利。其中，煤矿工人反对实行大批解雇的“企业合理化”计划的斗争表现得最为激烈，并且是日本工人维护生活权利斗争中的重点。
    以反对“安全条约”为中心的日本工人运动有了巨大的发展，工人的团结和同其他阶层人民的合作有了显著的增强。乘胜前进，日本工会总评议会已经决定了以阻止修改“安全条约”为中心的春季斗争计划。这个计划规定，总评议会将举行时间较长的、声势浩大的罢工来反对修改“安全条约”并使反对“安全条约”斗争的规模越来越广阔，参加的人数越来越多，计划还规定要在1月和2月里举行反对修改“安全条约”的大游行。
    在反对日美军事同盟的全民性运动的形成过程中，具有特别重要意义的是，受保守政党控制较严的日本农民也站起来同工人一道反对修改“安全条约”。日本农民组织在去年完成了统一，并且成立了“贯彻农民要求和阻止修改安全条约的农民联络恳谈会”。日本农民结合要求提高大米收购价格，反对重税，积极参加了反对“安全条约”的统一行动。东北和北陆地方十个县的农民和工人代表成立了十县工农联合斗争组织。而且这种工农联合组织也正在其他地方酝酿成立中。全日本农民协会联合会曾经通过决议表示：“日本农民要同工人联合起来，展开阻止修改安全条约的斗争，直到能够确保日本的和平、民主、独立的时候为止”。占日本人口40％的农民正在发挥着他们的巨大潜力和工人阶级同盟军的作用。日本的学生和青年举行了多次的罢课和游行，积极反对修改“安全条约”。他们清楚认识到：如果美日反动派修改“安全条约”的阴谋得逞，就有被强迫充当炮灰的危险。因此，日本青年发出了“不要把青年的鲜血出卖给美帝国主义！”“我们不愿为美国送死！”的强烈呼声。日本青年、学生在“青年和学生阻止修改安全条约中央共同斗争会议”的领导下，积极进行反对“安全条约”的宣传。
    日本妇女的二十多个团体早在去年7月就决定采取联合行动，反对修改“安全条约”。日本全国各地的一万二千名妇女和母亲代表不顾岸信介政府的恫吓、阻挠，在去年8月举行了母亲大会，表示反对修改“安全条约”。大会工作委员会还向全世界发表呼吁书说：“我们母亲不愿意我们的丈夫和儿子死在战场。我们力求同世界各地的朋友同心协力，来保证孩子们的幸福。从这个观点出发，我们决不能不反对修改‘安全条约’，这个条约是准备战争的军事同盟。”
    大学教授、作家、画家、演员、律师、新闻记者、宗教界人士等广泛阶层的人都参加到斗争的行列里。三千三百多名文化界人士已经成立了两个主要组织，一个是以科学家、哲学家为中心的“安全条约问题研究会”，另一个是以文学家为中心的“安全条约批判会”。南原繁、大内兵卫、末川博、上原专禄等学术界名流和其他参加这两个组织的会员们连续地在报刊上发表文章或到街头、工厂举行演讲，揭露修改“安全条约”对日本人民的危害，主张日本走和平中立道路。日本的一千五百位律师和法学家成立了“法学家阻止修改安全条约会议”，他们根据法理论证指出修改“安全条约”违反日本宪法和联合国宪章，美日反动派修改的“安全条约”是非法的，因为日本人民不承认日美军事同盟条约。
    八万中小企业资本家的组织——全国商工团体联合会在去年10月中旬召开的大会上决定和各界人民一起反对阻碍他们企业繁荣的日美“安全条约”体制。他们并且在这以后参加反对日美“安全条约”的全国统一行动。
    有的地方议会也通过决议，要求停止修改“安全条约”。日本执政党自由民主党内部一些有见识的人也不满岸信介修改“安全条约”的一些做法。
    现在，反对日美“安全条约”、反对日美军事同盟、反对军国主义复活已经成为日本全体人民的共同呼声，决定日本命运的将是他们，而不是一小撮一意孤行的美日反动派。（附图片）
