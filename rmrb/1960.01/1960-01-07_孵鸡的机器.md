    Chicken Incubation Machine

    The warm kang incubation machine created by the employees of the Tianjin Food Company Hatchery is easy to operate and saves labor, creating conditions for the widespread adoption of mechanical egg incubation in rural areas.

    The construction principle of the warm kang incubator is similar to that of the electric incubator, using a warm kang instead of electricity for heating. It can incubate more than 8,000 eggs per batch, with a breakage rate 3.2 percent lower than manual warm kang incubation; the hatching rate is 4 percent higher than manual incubation, reaching approximately 94 percent. Because the heat generated by the warm kang is gentle and the temperature inside the incubator is even, the hatched chicks are physically strong.

    This incubator mainly uses wood as raw material and coal and firewood as fuel.

    孵鸡的机器
    天津市食品公司孵化场职工创造的暖炕孵化机，操作简便，节省人力，为农村广泛采用机械孵卵创造了条件。
    暖炕孵化机的构造原理和电力孵化机差不多，是利用暖炕代替电力加温的。它每期可上孵种卵八千多个，破损率比人工暖炕孵化低百分之三点二；出雏率比人工孵化高百分之四，达到百分之九十四左右。由于暖炕发生的热度柔和，孵化机内的温度均匀，孵出的雏鸡体质健壮。
    这种孵化机主要用木材作原料，用煤炭、木柴作燃料。
