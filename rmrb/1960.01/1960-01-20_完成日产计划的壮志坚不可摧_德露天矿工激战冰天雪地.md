    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 18th: Open-pit lignite miners in the German Democratic Republic are engaged in a fierce battle against ice and snow to ensure the supply of lignite to industrial sectors.

    In the German Democratic Republic, lignite is extracted exclusively through open-pit mining. For the past week, continuous heavy snowfall has blanketed the country, freezing the surface layers of lignite mines and disrupting transportation routes in many mining areas. Undeterred by the heavy snow and severe cold, the workers are fighting against nature, striving to fulfill and exceed their daily production plans.

    Workers at several lignite mines in the Halle district have been working around the clock, deploying snowplow teams to clear accumulated snow from the mine's transportation routes. In some areas where thick layers of ice have formed, workers are using flamethrowers to melt the frozen earth. Engineers, technicians, and cadres are also working day and night with the workers to break ice and clear snow. Soldiers of the National People's Army, People's Police, construction workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, and students from nearby areas have also joined this battle. Their support has been warmly welcomed by the workers.

    In this intense battle, the Party organizations in the mining areas have strengthened their leadership.

    Thanks to the hard work of the miners and their supporters, production plans in various mining areas have been well fulfilled. On January 12th, miners at the Greifenhain mine exceeded their daily production target by 17%.

    完成日产计划的壮志坚不可摧
    德露天矿工激战冰天雪地
    新华社柏林18日电　德意志民主共和国的露天褐煤矿工人正在向冰雪展开激战，以保证对工业部门的褐煤供应。
    德意志民主共和国的褐煤都是露天开采。一周来，全国各地连日下着大雪，褐煤矿表层冰冻，许多矿区运输线路也受到阻碍。工人们不顾大雪和严寒，向自然进行战斗，争取完成和超额完成每天的生产计划。
    哈雷专区的几个褐煤矿的工人昼夜不停地出动了扫雪车队，清扫矿区运输线路上的积雪。有些地方结成了坚厚的冰层，工人们便用火焰喷射器融化冻土。工程师、技术人员和干部也日夜和工人一起破冰扫雪。矿区附近的国家人民军士兵、人民警察、建筑工人、农业合作社社员和学生们也参加了这一场战斗。他们的支援受到了工人们的热烈欢迎。
    在这场紧张的战斗中，矿区党组织加强了领导工作。
    在工人们和支援者的奋战下，各矿区生产计划完成得很好。格雷芬哈因矿工12日这一天超额17％完成了日产指标。
