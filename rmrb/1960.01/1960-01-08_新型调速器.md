    New Type Governor
    China's first batch of "PO-40" type governors have recently been successfully manufactured at the Hunan Hydroelectric Equipment Factory. This batch of governors was successively transported to hydroelectric power stations in Tianjin, Beijing, and other places for a series of tests, including dynamic characteristics, static characteristics, constant load, variable load, and load rejection. All tests proved that the performance of its various components was good, able to respond and control sensitively, and run very stably.
    The "PO-40" type governor is a precise automatic remote-control instrument used on hydro-generators with a capacity of 1,000 to 15,000 kilowatts. It has a complex structure and requires a high degree of automation and precision.

    新型调速器
    我国第一批“PO—40”型调速器最近在湖南水力发电设备厂制造成功。这批调速器先后运往天津、北京等地的水电站作了动特性、静特性和定负荷、变负荷、甩负荷等一系列试验，都证明它的各个部件性能良好，能够灵敏地反应控制，运转很稳定。
    “PO—40”型调速器是一千到一万五千瓩水轮发电机上使用的一种自动遥远控制精密仪器。它的结构繁杂，自动化程度和精密度要求很高。
