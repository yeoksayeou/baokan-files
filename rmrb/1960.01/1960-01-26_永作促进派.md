To the Editors of "Always Be a Promoter":

    Chairman Mao taught us: The enemy rots with every passing day, while we get better and better. This is absolutely true. Our Louzhuang Wheat Specialized Team's production, under the leadership of the Party, has grown stronger year after year.
    The specialized team was established during the high tide of people's communes. The commune organized labor cooperation to help us deeply plow wheat fields and harvest wheat, resulting in a bumper harvest of 400 jin per mu on the 1,540 mu of wheat planted last year, nearly tripling the yield compared to 1958. After seeing the news of the achievements in national economic construction in 1959, we were greatly encouraged and determined to improve upon the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1959.
    In the new year, we will not only achieve high wheat yields but also cultivate a large number of talents. We have already set up fourteen kinds of experimental plots to transform the specialized team into a red and expert school. Our one hundred plus team members are determined to master more agricultural technical knowledge and always be promoters of agricultural production.
                Li Jie, Captain of the Louzhuang Wheat Specialized Team, Sino-German Friendship Commune, Beijing

    永作促进派编辑同志：
    毛主席告诉我们说：敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。这话真是千真万确。我们楼梓庄小麦专业队的生产就是在党的领导下搞得一年比一年强。
    专业队是在人民公社化的高潮中建立起来的。公社组织劳力协作，帮助我们深翻麦田，收割小麦，使得去年种植的一千五百四十亩小麦获得亩产四百斤的大丰收，比1958年提高将近三倍。看到1959年国民经济建设成就的消息后，我们受到很大鼓舞，决心要把1959年大跃进的成绩再提高一步。
    我们在新的一年里不但要使小麦高产，还要培养大批人材。我们已经搞了十四种试验田，要把专业队变成红专学校。我们一百多名队员决心掌握更多的农业技术知识，永远作农业生产的促进派。
                北京中德友好公社楼梓庄小麦专业队长  李杰
