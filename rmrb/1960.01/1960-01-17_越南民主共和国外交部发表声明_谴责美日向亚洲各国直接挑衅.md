Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 16th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement on the upcoming signing of a new "Security Treaty" between Japan and the United States, stating that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares its firm opposition to the Japanese government's signing of a new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the U.S. government, and views this act as a behavior that undermines peace, prepares for a new war, and directly provokes countries in Asia and the Pacific region.

The statement pointed out that Kishin Suke's action of signing the so-called new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the U.S. government aims to promote the revival of Japanese militarism, further strengthen the Japan-U.S. military alliance, prepare for wars of aggression, and seriously threaten peace in Asia and the world.

The statement also pointed out that this action blatantly violates the international agreements signed by the Allied countries during and after World War II, which aimed to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism and the resumption of aggression.

The statement said that the Vietnamese people, who suffered the disasters caused by Japanese fascism in Vietnam from 1940 to 1945, clearly see the danger of the revival of Japanese militarism and the strengthening of the Japan-U.S. military aggressive alliance. The Vietnamese people and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have repeatedly condemned the danger of the Kishin Suke government and U.S. imperialism's revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The statement said that the Vietnamese People and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly believe that the just struggle of the Japanese people will receive the warm support of the people of Asian and world countries, and will ultimately be victorious, and the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Kishin Suke government to enslave the Japanese people and threaten the peace of Asian countries will surely be defeated.

    越南民主共和国外交部发表声明
    谴责美日向亚洲各国直接挑衅
    新华社河内16日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天就日本同美国即将签订新的“安全条约”发表声明说，越南民主共和国政府声明坚决反对日本政府同美国政府签订新的日美“安全条约”，并把这种行为看作是破坏和平、准备发动新战争、向亚洲和太平洋区域各国直接挑衅的行为。
    声明指出，岸信介同美国政府签订所谓新的日美“安全条约”的行动，目的在于促进日本军国主义的复活，进一步加强日美军事同盟，在于准备侵略战争，严重威胁亚洲和世界和平。
    声明还指出，这个行动明目张胆地违反了同盟国家在第二次世界大战中和大战后签订的国际协定，这些协定目的在于防止日本军国主义复活和重新进行侵略。
    声明说，饱受日本法西斯主义从1940年到1945年在越南制造的灾祸的越南人民，清楚地看到日本军国主义的复活和日美军事侵略同盟的加强的危险。越南人民和越南民主共和国曾经一再斥责岸信介政府和美帝国主义修改日美“安全条约”的危险。
    声明说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚信，日本人民的正义斗争将获得亚洲和世界各国人民的热烈支持，最后一定取得胜利，美帝国主义和岸信介政府奴役日本人民和威胁亚洲各国安宁的阴谋一定会遭到失败。
