Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 28th: A communiqué on the visit of the German Democratic Republic government delegation to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was published here today.

The communiqué states that the delegation of the German Democratic Republic government, headed by Heinrich Rau, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, held talks with the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government, headed by Pham Van Dong, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on international issues and issues related to the two countries. The talks took place in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. The two sides reached complete agreement on the issues discussed. Both sides noted with satisfaction that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is developing rapidly, and the balance of power on the international stage is constantly changing in a direction favorable to the forces of peace. Therefore, the possibility of preventing war and maintaining world peace currently exists.

The communiqué states that both sides believe that the visit of Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev to the United States made an important contribution to improving the world situation and created favorable conditions for the upcoming summit conference. The communiqué states that the government delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the German Democratic Republic welcome the resolution adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on a further reduction of armed forces by 1.2 million men. Both sides believe that this resolution once again demonstrates the Soviet Union's sincere desire to achieve lasting peace.

The communiqué touched on the importance of the principle of peaceful coexistence for developing political, economic, and cultural ties between countries with different social systems and easing international tensions. The communiqué stated that both sides condemn all activities that create tension, such as the U.S. intervention in Laos.

The communiqué pointed out that the signing of military treaties aimed at strengthening armaments is not in line with the principles of peaceful coexistence and consultation. The signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will lead to the revival of Japanese militarism and the transformation of Japan into a military base for U.S. imperialism. This treaty seriously threatens peace and security in Asia and the world.

The communiqué states that both sides welcome the rising movement of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for achieving and consolidating national independence.

The communiqué states that both sides believe that the signing of peace treaties with the two German states and the transformation of West Berlin into a demilitarized free city are the most important issues for guaranteeing peace in Europe and will create preliminary conditions for the reunification of Germany and making Germany a democratic and peaceful country.

The communiqué states that the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the summit conference must reach an agreement on this urgent issue, and representatives of the German Democratic Republic must be allowed to participate in the discussions on the German question. Both sides strongly condemn the Adenauer government's attempts to obstruct the resolution of the German question and its creation of increasingly obvious national hatred and chauvinism in West Germany.

The communiqué states that regarding the situation in Vietnam, both sides believe that U.S. imperialism's intervention in South Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into its colony and military base, and carrying out military expansion and war preparations there, as well as the South Vietnamese authorities' implementation of a brutal fascist dictatorial policy, completely violate the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam and undermine the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. Both sides emphasized that Vietnam must be reunified peacefully on the basis of national independence and democracy in accordance with the provisions of the 1954 Geneva Accords.

The communiqué states that both sides are pleased to see that the relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the German Democratic Republic, established on the principle of proletarian internationalism, are constantly being consolidated and developed. The communiqué states that both sides expressed that, for the interests of the two peoples and for the interests of socialism and world peace, the two countries will resolutely further expand their ties with each other.

    河内公布德政府代表团访越公报
    谴责日美军事条约威胁和平
    斥美国干涉南越和阿登纳阻挠德国问题解决
    新华社河内28日电　此间今天公布了德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问越南民主共和国的公报。
    公报说，以德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、德意志民主共和国副总理海因里希·劳为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团同以越南劳动党中央政治局委员、越南民主共和国总理范文同为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团就国际问题和同两国有关的问题进行了会谈。会谈是在亲切和友好的气氛中进行的。双方就所讨论的问题取得了完全一致的意见。双方满意地看到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营正在迅速发展，国际舞台上的力量对比正在朝着有利于和平力量的方向不断地变化，因此，目前存在着防止战争和维护世界和平的可能性。
    公报说，双方认为，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫到美国进行的访问，为改善世界局势作出了重要贡献，并且为即将举行的最高级会议创造了有利的条件。公报说，越南民主共和国政府代表团和德意志民主共和国政府代表团欢迎苏联最高苏维埃通过的关于再次裁减武装部队一百二十万人的决议。双方认为，这项决议再次表现了苏联真诚希望获致持久和平的意愿。
    公报谈到和平共处原则对发展不同社会制度各国之间的政治、经济和文化联系以及缓和国际局势的重要意义。公报说，双方谴责制造紧张局势的一切活动，例如美国对老挝的干涉。
    公报指出，签订目的在于加强军备的军事条约，不符合和平共处和协商的原则。新的日美“安全条约”的签订，将导致恢复日本军国主义和把日本变成美帝国主义的军事基地。这项条约严重地威胁着亚洲和世界的和平和安全。
    公报说，双方欢迎亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民为反对殖民主义、争取和巩固民族独立的日益高涨的运动。
    公报说，双方认为，同两个德国签订对德和约和把西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市，是保障欧洲和平的最重要的问题，并将为统一德国和使德国成为民主、和平的国家创造初步条件。
    公报说，越南民主共和国政府代表团认为，最高级会议必须就这个迫切的问题达成协议，德意志民主共和国的代表必须得以参加有关德国问题的讨论。双方强烈谴责阿登纳政府企图阻挠德国问题的解决而在西德制造日益明显的民族仇恨和沙文主义的行为。
    公报说，关于越南的局势，双方认为，美帝国主义对南越的干涉、把南越变成它的殖民地和军事基地以及在那里进行扩军备战的行动，南越当局推行残暴的法西斯独裁政策，完全违反了1954年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，破坏了越南的和平统一。双方强调，必须按照1954年日内瓦协议的规定，在民族独立和民主的基础上以和平方式统一越南。
    公报说，双方高兴地看到越南民主共和国同德意志民主共和国基于无产阶级国际主义原则所建立的关系得到不断的巩固和发展。公报说，双方表示，为了两个民族的利益，为了社会主义和世界和平的利益，两国将坚决进一步扩大彼此之间的联系。
