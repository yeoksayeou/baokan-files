	A Little Interlude in the "Peace" Trick
	The American film "On the Beach" has recently been shown simultaneously in eighteen cities around the world. This film is a fictional story depicting the tragic fate of mankind after a hypothetical nuclear war destroys humanity. United Press International, in a report on the screenings, emphasized the film's "anti-war theme." The American government is organizing large-scale screenings of such a film around the world, seemingly as if the American ruling group is filled with a heart opposed to nuclear war.
	However, according to the January 4th issue of the American magazine "Newsweek," the American military authorities have issued an order prohibiting American military personnel everywhere from seeing the film "On the Beach." This cannot help but make people feel strange. Why "welcome for appreciation by people of all countries, but no admission for American soldiers"? If the American government really wants to conduct propaganda and education against nuclear war, shouldn't those soldiers who might directly launch and participate in nuclear war be the first to be propagandized and educated? Old Chinese novels often depict black shop owners enthusiastically urging guests to drink wine while not touching their own glasses; this inevitably means that the wine contains sleeping pills or poison.
	It is said that the reason the American military issued such a ban is because they are afraid it will cause pressure to ban nuclear weapons. Of course, it cannot be said that the American ruling group does not have such worries. People who see the devastation of nuclear war will be more determined to demand the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and such consequences are indeed not welcomed by the American ruling group. However, this is not the real reason why the American military authorities forbade American soldiers from seeing "On the Beach." The Pentagon fears that this film will affect their war mood.
	In this way, people can clearly see the real purpose of the American government recommending this film everywhere. It wants to use the terror of nuclear war to scare the people of all countries and weaken the will of the people of all countries to resist American aggression. In order to achieve this goal, the American government even risks the possible pressure to demand the prohibition of nuclear weapons. Therefore, in the eyes of the Pentagon, this film is of course not for American soldiers to see.
	The screening of "On the Beach" is a small interlude in the recent American peace tricks. And it also typically reflects the two-faced tactics of American peace tricks and its insurmountable contradictions. The American ruling group wants to play the peace card, but is afraid that this posture will cause greater pressure from the people of all countries to demand peace; it wants to use a smokescreen of peace to paralyze the people of all countries, but is afraid that its own military morale will also be scattered as a result. Therefore, people cannot help but see the various embarrassing appearances of the disguised messengers of peace. The good show is yet to come.

### “和平”把戏的小插曲

    “和平”把戏的小插曲
    美国影片“在海滩上”最近在世界各地十八个城市同时放映。这部影片是描写一场假想的核战争使人类遭到毁灭的悲惨遭遇的一个虚构故事。美国合众国际社在一则报道放映情况的消息里，大事强调这部影片的“反战的主题”。美国政府把这样一部影片大张旗鼓地在世界各地组织放映，看来仿佛美国统治集团是满怀反对核战争之心的。
    但是，据1月4日的美国“新闻周刊”报道，美国军事当局却发出一道训令，禁止各地的美国军事人员去看“在海滩上”这部影片。这就不能不使人感到奇怪了。为什么“各国人士欢迎鉴赏，美国军人谢绝参观”呢？如果美国政府真是想对人们进行反对核战争的宣传和教育，首先应当对之进行宣传和教育的，难道不正是那些可能直接发动和参与核战争的军人吗？中国旧小说常常描写黑店的主人殷勤劝酒而自己杯不沾唇，就必然是酒里下有迷药或者毒药的。
    据说美国军方所以要颁布这样禁令的理由，是因为恐怕会引起要禁止核武器的压力。当然，不能说美国统治集团没有这样的忧虑。人们看到了核战争的浩劫，是会更坚决要求禁止核武器的，而这样的后果的确不是美国统治集团所欢迎的。但是，这并不是美国军事当局禁止美国军人去看“在海滩上”的真正原因。五角大楼是怕这部影片会影响他们的战争情绪。
    这样，人们对于美国政府到处推荐这部影片的真正目的也就可以看得很清楚了。它是想用核战争的恐怖来吓唬各国人民，削弱各国人民反对美国侵略的意志。为了达到这样的目的，美国政府甚至甘冒可能引起要求禁止核武器的压力的风险。因此，五角大楼看来，这部影片当然是美国军人看不得的。
    “在海滩上”的放映是美国最近的和平把戏中的一个小插曲。而它也颇为典型地反映了美国和平把戏的两面手法和它无法克服的矛盾。美国统治集团既要玩弄和平姿态，又怕这种姿态会引起各国人民要求和平的更大压力；要想用和平烟幕来麻痹各国人民，又害怕自己的军心也因而涣散了。因此，人们就不能不看到假扮的和平使者各种各样的尴尬相。好戏还在后头哩。
