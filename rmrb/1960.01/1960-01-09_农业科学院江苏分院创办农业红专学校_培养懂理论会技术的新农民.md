Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 8th. The Agricultural Red and Expert School, founded by the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, has trained a group of agricultural technical personnel who combine theory and practice for the people's communes through the method of combining learning, productive labor, and scientific research. Three hundred and fifty-nine students graduated at the end of last month and returned to the people's communes at the beginning of this month.

This group of students are all cadres from the people's communes and teams in Jiangsu Province, more than 90% are Party and League members, and they have a certain level of education and production experience. The overall goal of this school is to conduct comprehensive research on large-scale, high-yield agriculture. It is divided into five majors: food crops, cash crops, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, soil and fertilizer, and agricultural machinery. Teaching adopts a method that combines theory and practice, classroom instruction and field labor. Courses are arranged according to the production season, and the experimental farm is used as a base for learning and doing at the same time. In this way, the students can not only learn theoretical knowledge, but also learn operational skills, and also do scientific experiments and research.

After more than a year of learning and doing, the students have begun to master the basic theoretical knowledge and professional skills of agricultural science. Under the guidance of Chen Yongkang, a national model of high rice yield and vice principal, and other researchers, the students majoring in food crops systematically studied the cultivation techniques and high-yield experiences of crops such as rice, three wheats (wheat, barley, and naked barley), and corn. The students also learned from the high-yield rice experimental field the technical measures taken by Chen Yongkang based on soil quality, varieties, and deep plowing conditions for rational close planting of rice, timely and appropriate fertilization, and irrigation. They initially mastered Chen Yongkang's experience in creating late rice cultivation. The students majoring in cash crops mastered a complete set of scientific technologies for cotton from planting to harvesting, especially the scientific experience of achieving high cotton yields on saline-alkali land; they also conducted research on the cultivation and management techniques of various fruit trees and vegetables. The students majoring in soil and fertilizer learned fifteen or sixteen methods of improving soil. From the initial stage of not knowing what the three elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were or the role of chemical fertilizers, they now have a preliminary understanding of what kind of fertilizer should be applied to what crop at what time. The students majoring in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine learned the feeding and management techniques of poultry and livestock through their own labor in raising pigs, cattle, sheep, and chickens, as well as field management of feed crops, and the methods of increasing the number of piglets produced by sows. They can also serve as veterinarians after returning to the commune. The students majoring in agricultural machinery understood the structure, principles, operating techniques, and mechanical drawing of engines, rice transplanters, threshers, seeders, and harvesters, and can also drive tractors to cultivate land. In the graduation examination, the general score was above 70, and 33% reached above 90.

In the past year or so, they have not only learned agricultural science and technology, but also greatly improved their political ideology. They personally experienced the correctness of the Party's education policy and eliminated the superstition that science and technology are unattainable. Scientific research institutions have also concentrated the production experience of the students themselves and, after analysis and research, elevated it to theory.

Now, this Red and Expert School is preparing to continue enrollment and is expected to start the second phase in February. (Attached picture)

    农业科学院江苏分院创办农业红专学校
    培养懂理论会技术的新农民
    新华社南京8日电　中国农业科学院江苏分院创办的一所农业红专学校，通过学习、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的办法，为人民公社培训了一批理论与实践相结合的农业技术人材。三百五十九名学员已于上月底毕业，在本月初分别返回人民公社。
    这一批学员，都是江苏省各个人民公社的社、队干部，90％以上是党团员，具有一定的文化水平和生产经验。这个学校总的目标是对农业大面积高额丰产作综合研究。它分设粮食作物、经济作物、畜牧兽医、土壤肥料和农业机具等五个专业，教学采取理论与实践相结合，课堂讲授与田间劳动相结合的办法，根据生产季节安排课程，以试验农场为基地，边学边做。这样，使学员们既能学到理论知识，又能学到操作技术，同时也做了科学试验研究工作。
    学员们经过一年多来边学、边做，开始掌握了农业科学的基础理论知识和专业技术。粮食作物专业的学生，在全国水稻丰产模范、副校长陈永康和其他研究人员的指导下，系统地学习了水稻、三麦（小麦、大麦、元麦）、玉米等作物的栽培技术和高产经验。学员们还通过水稻丰产试验田学到了陈永康根据土质、品种和深翻等条件，进行水稻合理密植、适时适量施肥、灌水等技术措施，初步掌握了陈永康创造的晚稻栽培的经验，经济作物专业的学员，掌握了棉花从种到收的一整套科学技术，特别是在盐碱地上取得棉花高产的科学经验；同时对各种果树、蔬菜的栽培管理技术，也进行了研究。土壤肥料专业的学员学会了十五、六种改良土壤的办法，从初来时不知道什么叫氮、磷、钾三要素等化肥名词和作用，到现在已经初步懂得什么作物在什么时候应该施什么品种的肥料。畜牧兽医专业的学员，经过自己养猪、养牛、养羊、养鸡以及对饲料作物的田间管理劳动，学会了家禽家畜的饲养管理技术，以及使母猪多产小猪的办法，回到公社以后还可以担任兽医。农业机具专业的学员，懂得了发动机、插秧机、脱粒机、播种机、收割机的结构、原理、操纵技术和机械制图，还可以驾驶拖拉机耕地。在毕业考试中，一般成绩都在七十分以上，有33％达到九十分以上。
    一年多来，他们不仅学到了农业科学技术，而且在政治思想上也有很大提高。他们亲身体会到党的教育方针的正确性，破除了科学技术高不可攀的迷信。科学研究机关也把学员自己的生产经验集中起来，经过分析研究上升到理论。
    现在，这所红专学校正准备继续招生，预计在2月间开办第二期。（附图片）
