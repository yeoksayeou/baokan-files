    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd January: Hanoi newspapers today all published commentaries and articles congratulating the Soviet Union on the successful launch of a multi-stage ballistic rocket into the Pacific region.

    The "People's Daily" editorial said that this event proves the superiority of socialism, and demonstrates the progress of Soviet science and technology and the power of peace. The editorial stated that in our era, the power of true science, the power of socialism, and the power of peace are inseparable. The miracles of the Soviet Union's successful launching of artificial satellites and multi-stage ballistic rockets are closely linked to the glorious task of the Soviet Union's recent announcement to overfulfill the Seven-Year Plan. Therefore, when the news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a multi-stage ballistic rocket, the Soviet Union's achievements in 1959, and the Soviet Union's further reduction of its armed forces by 1.2 million troops were announced, peace-loving people all over the world cheered the great victory of the Soviet Union and believed that the Soviet Union would achieve even greater victories in the near future.

    The editorial said that the imperialist reactionary group headed by the warmongers of U.S. imperialism were already panicked when the Soviet Union announced that it would launch a multi-stage ballistic rocket. The fact that the United States has lost to the Soviet Union in conquering outer space and launching intercontinental missiles is already a well-known fact. In the competition between the two systems of the world, the United States will suffer even more disastrous defeats.

    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Washington - The news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a long-range rocket into the Pacific test area has caused a strong reaction in the United States. Many official representatives have also been forced to publicly admit the fact that the United States is lagging behind.

    George Allen, Director of the United States Information Agency, reluctantly admitted while speaking to the House Space Committee on the 22nd that people in other parts of the world regard the Soviet Union as "the number one space nation, and will continue to be so for some time to come."

    Robert Meyner, the Governor of New Jersey, believes that the situation in the United States is "shameful and infuriating." He said, "We suddenly find ourselves facing the possibility that we may be on the road to becoming a second-rate nation." He admitted that the United States has "fallen too far behind" in missiles, "so that whether we can catch up has become a serious question."

    The "New York Times," in an editorial entitled "Aimed Shot," mentioned Secretary of Defense Gates' recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, declaring that the United States and the Soviet Union were evenly matched in missiles, saying, "If his words are taken seriously, then the complacency contained in those words is fundamentally inconsistent with the evidence that has emerged this week; this evidence shows that Soviet rockets can accurately hit targets that are much farther away from the launch point than we can."

    越南“人民报”欢呼苏联新火箭发射成功
    苏联科学的胜利是和平的胜利
    美国官方人物被迫公开承认美国落后
    据新华社河内23日电　河内各报今天都发表评论和文章，祝贺苏联成功地向太平洋地区发射了多级弹道火箭。
    “人民报”的社论说，这个事件证明社会主义的优越性，证明了苏联科学技术的进步和和平的威力。社论说，在我们的时代里，真正的科学的威力、社会主义的威力和和平的威力是分不开的。苏联成功地发射人造卫星和多级弹道火箭的奇迹同苏联最近宣布要超额完成七年计划的光荣任务是紧密地联系着的。因此，苏联这次成功地发射多级弹道火箭、苏联在1959年取得的成就和苏联再一次裁减武装部队一百二十万人等消息传来时，世界上爱好和平的人民都欢呼苏联的伟大胜利，相信在不久的将来苏联还将取得更大的胜利。
    社论说，以美帝国主义好战分子为首的帝国主义反动集团在苏联公布要发射多级弹道火箭时就已经惊慌失措。美国在征服宇宙空间和发射洲际导弹方面输给了苏联，这已经是众所周知的事实。在世界两个体系的竞赛中，美国将遭到更加惨重的失败。
    据新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：苏联向太平洋试验区成功发射远程火箭的消息在美国引起了强烈反应。不少官方代表人物也被迫公开承认美国落后的事实。
    美国新闻署署长艾伦22日在美国众议院空间委员会讲话时无可奈何地承认世界其他地区的人民都把苏联看成是“第一号空间国家，并且在今后一个时期中会继续如此”。
    美国新泽西州州长麦纳认为美国的情况“使人丢脸和令人生气”。他说，“我们突然发现我们自己面临着这样一个可能性：我们很可能走上了成为二等国家的道路。”他承认说，美国在导弹方面已经“落后太远”，“以致能否赶上去已成为一个严重的问题”。
    “纽约时报”在一篇题为“瞄准的射击”的社论中提到国防部长盖茨不久前在参院军事委员会作证时、宣称在导弹方面美国同苏联势均力敌的那番话时说，“如果把他的话当真，那末这些话里面所包含的那种自我安慰是根本不符合本周出现的证据的；这些证据表明，苏联火箭能准确击中的目标离开发射点的距离要比我们所能做到的远得多。”
