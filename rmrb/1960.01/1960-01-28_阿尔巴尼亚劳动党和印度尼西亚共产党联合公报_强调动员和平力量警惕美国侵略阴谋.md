Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 26th: Newspapers here published on the 26th the communiqué of the talks between the delegations of the Albanian Party of Labor and the Indonesian Communist Party. The communiqué stated that during the visit of the Indonesian Communist Party delegation led by Chairman of the Central Committee D.N. Aidit to Albania (January 12th to 22nd), the delegations of the two parties held talks on a series of issues of mutual concern. The delegations of the two parties noted with satisfaction that they had complete agreement on all the issues discussed.

The communiqué said that during the talks, the delegations of the Albanian Party of Labor and the Indonesian Communist Party exchanged views on issues related to the two parties and the two countries. The Albanian Party of Labor delegation highly valued the Indonesian Communist Party's resolute struggle and great efforts to unite all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal progressive forces in Indonesia into a national united front to consolidate national independence, and to strive for the progress and happiness of the Indonesian people.

The communiqué pointed out that the delegations of the two parties also exchanged views on the international political situation and the issue of defending peace. Both sides emphasized that due to the peace policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist camp countries, as well as other peace-loving countries, and due to the continuous growth of peace forces, a warming trend has appeared in international relations. The delegations of the two parties welcomed the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament put forward by the Soviet Union.

The communiqué pointed out, however, that the reactionary forces of imperialist countries, especially the reactionary forces of the United States, do not abandon their "position of strength" policy and "Cold War" policy. This policy is manifested in: maintaining and strengthening aggressive military blocs—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization; engaging in an arms race; increasing military bases in foreign countries; arming West Germany; revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"; and stationing American troops in the aforementioned countries as well as South Korea, South Vietnam, and Taiwan. Therefore, the delegations of the two parties believe that it is necessary to mobilize all peace-loving and progressive forces to defend lasting peace for the people of all countries, and it is necessary to strengthen and heighten revolutionary vigilance against the conspiracies of international reactionaries.

The delegations of the two parties then emphasized in the communiqué the great role played by the People's Republic of China, as a member of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, in defending peace. Both sides condemned the acts of aggression and provocation by American imperialism against the People's Republic of China, and fully supported the legitimate right of the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations and the complete liberation of Taiwan, an indivisible part of Chinese territory.

The delegations of the two parties also expressed their support for the Asian people's struggle for national liberation, to break free from the shackles of colonialism, and to consolidate national independence. The Albanian people and the Party of Labor unreservedly support the efforts of the Indonesian people and government to liberate West Irian, an indivisible territory of the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian Communist Party delegation supports the Leninist policy of peaceful coexistence pursued by the Albanian government in international relations. The People's Republic of Albania plays a very important role in making the Balkan and Adriatic regions a region of peace.

When discussing the international communist movement and the workers' movement, the delegations of the two parties pointed out in the communiqué that the events of recent years have fully confirmed all the arguments in the declaration of the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries in 1957 and the "Peace Manifesto." Both sides once again emphasized that, under the current conditions, the main danger in the international communist movement and the workers' movement is modern revisionism; the most dangerous representatives of modern revisionism are the Yugoslav revisionists. Revisionism seeks to lead the working class away from Marxism-Leninism, disarm the working class, undermine the unity of the socialist camp, belittle the victories of the socialist camp, and open the way for the restoration of capitalism.

The communiqué concluded by saying that the delegations of the two parties will continue to strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the two parties in the future for the benefit of socialism.

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和印度尼西亚共产党联合公报
    强调动员和平力量警惕美国侵略阴谋
    几年来的事件完全证实了一九五七年莫斯科会议两个宣言的一切论点；强调指出，在当前条件下，国际共产主义运动中的主要危险是现代修正主义。
    新华社地拉那26日电　此间报纸26日发表了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和印度尼西亚共产党代表团的会谈公报。公报说，在以中央委员会主席艾地为首的印度尼西亚共产党代表团访问阿尔巴尼亚期间（1月12日至22日），两党代表团曾经就双方共同关心的一系列问题进行了会谈。两党代表团满意地指出，他们对所讨论的一切问题意见完全一致。
    公报说，会谈期间，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和印度尼西亚共产党代表团就有关两党和两国的问题交换了意见。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团非常重视印度尼西亚共产党为了争取把全印度尼西亚反帝反封建的进步力量团结到民族联合阵线中以巩固民族独立，以及为了争取印度尼西亚人民的进步和幸福而进行的坚决斗争和巨大努力。
    公报指出，两党代表团还就国际政治形势和保卫和平的问题交换了意见，双方强调指出，由于苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家以及其他爱好和平的国家的和平政策，由于和平力量的不断增长，国际关系中出现了转暖的过程。两党代表团欢迎苏联所提出的全面和彻底裁军的建议。
    公报指出，但是，帝国主义国家的反动势力，首先是美国的反动势力，却不放弃他们的“实力地位”政策和“冷战”政策，这个政策的表现就是：保持和加强侵略性的军事集团——北大西洋公约组织、中央条约组织和东南亚条约组织，进行军备竞赛，增加在外国的军事基地，武装西德，修改日美“安全条约”，并在上述国家以及南朝鲜、南越和台湾驻扎美国军队。因此，两党代表团认为，必须动员一切爱好和平和进步的力量来保卫各国人民的持久和平，必须加强和提高对国际反动派的阴谋的革命警惕性。
    两党代表团接着在公报中强调指出了作为以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的一员的中华人民共和国在保卫和平方面所起的伟大作用。双方谴责美国帝国主义对中华人民共和国所进行的侵略和挑衅活动，并完全支持中华人民共和国进入联合国的合法权利和完全解放中国领土不可分割的一部分—台湾。
    两党代表团还表示支持亚洲人民为争取民族解放、摆脱殖民主义者的束缚和巩固民族独立而进行的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民和劳动党无保留地支持印度尼西亚人民和政府为解放印度尼西亚共和国不可分割的领土—西伊里安所作的努力。印度尼西亚共产党代表团支持阿尔巴尼亚政府在国际关系中所执行的和平共处的列宁主义政策。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国对于使巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区成为一个和平地区起着极重要的作用。
    在谈到国际共产主义运动和工人运动时，两党代表团在公报中指出，最近几年来的事件完全证实了1957年社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议的宣言和“和平宣言”中的一切论点。双方再一次强调指出，在当前条件下，国际共产主义运动和工人运动的主要危险是现代修正主义；现代修正主义最危险的代表是南斯拉夫修正主义者。修正主义是要使工人阶级离开马克思列宁主义，解除工人阶级的武装，破坏社会主义阵营的团结，贬低社会主义阵营的胜利并为资本主义的复辟打开道路。
    公报最后说，两党代表团今后仍然要加强两党之间的友谊和合作以有利于社会主义。
