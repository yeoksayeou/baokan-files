Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 31st: The eleventh session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam successfully concluded this afternoon.

Today's meeting unanimously passed the new Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the resolution on the implementation of the new Constitution. It also passed the election law of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the resolution on the issue of representatives from South Vietnam in the Second National Assembly of Vietnam.

After the plenary session passed the new Constitution this afternoon, President Ho Chi Minh delivered a speech on behalf of the Constitution Revision Committee of Vietnam, pointing out that the new Constitution passed by the eleventh session of the National Assembly will further encourage the people of North Vietnam to actively build socialism and further encourage the people of South Vietnam to fight for democracy, freedom, and the realization of national reunification.

President Ho Chi Minh called on the Vietnamese people to work hard to increase production, practice strict economy, promote all tasks, and strengthen the struggle for the reunification of the motherland. President Ho Chi Minh's speech was constantly interrupted by applause and cheers from the audience.

Before President Ho Chi Minh's speech, a delegation composed of people from all walks of life in Vietnam, ethnic minorities, returned overseas Vietnamese, and people gathered in North Vietnam from South Vietnam congratulated the eleventh session of the National Assembly. Yin Jishen, chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, delivered a speech on behalf of the delegation, warmly congratulating the National Assembly on passing the new Constitution. He said that under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the people of the whole country will unite closely to implement the new Constitution, complete the major tasks of the country in 1960, and promote the socialist construction of the North.

After unanimously passing the National Assembly Election Law at today's afternoon meeting, the resolution on the issue of representatives from South Vietnam in the Second National Assembly of Vietnam was passed.

The resolution condemned the South Vietnamese authorities for refusing to hold general elections, seriously undermining the Geneva Accords, and undermining the cause of national reunification. The resolution pointed out that Vietnam is a unified country, and the National Assembly of Vietnam represents the will of the entire Vietnamese people. There must be representatives of the people of South Vietnam in the National Assembly. The representatives of the people of South Vietnam in the current National Assembly were elected by the people of South Vietnam in the early days of the anti-French war, and they fought heroically alongside the people of South Vietnam. Their voice is the voice of the people of South Vietnam. Under the condition that the people of South Vietnam cannot conduct free general elections like the people of North Vietnam, the presence of representatives of the people of South Vietnam in the National Assembly symbolizes the reunification of the motherland. The resolution decided to extend the term of office of the representatives of South Vietnam in the First National Assembly of Vietnam until a new resolution is made.

After the meeting unanimously passed this resolution, President Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Ton Duc Thang spoke successively. They represented the Vietnam Workers' Party, the government, and the National Assembly, warmly welcoming this resolution, and pointed out that this resolution embodies the flesh-and-blood feelings of all the Vietnamese people, as well as their will and desire.

The resolution on the implementation of the Constitution passed by the meeting instructed the Standing Committee of the National Assembly and the Council of Ministers to hold the election of representatives to the Second National Assembly in the first half of 1960.

After Chairman Ton Duc Thang delivered the closing speech, the eleventh session of the National Assembly of Vietnam declared a successful conclusion.

This afternoon, tens of thousands of people from all walks of life in Hanoi gathered in the square in front of the National Assembly Hall (Hanoi Grand Theatre) to warmly cheer the passage of the new Constitution by the National Assembly. Vietnamese party and government leaders, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, stepped onto the backstage of the Grand Theatre to meet the masses.

    越南国会第十一次会议胜利闭幕
    通过越南民主共和国新宪法
    胡主席号召增产节约加强争取祖国统一的斗争
    据新华社河内31日电　越南民主共和国国会第十一次会议今天下午胜利闭幕。
    今天的会议一致通过了越南民主共和国新宪法和关于执行新宪法的决议，并且通过了越南民主共和国国会选举法和关于越南第二届国会的南越代表问题的决议。
    在今天下午举行的全体会议通过了新宪法以后，胡志明主席代表越南修改宪法委员会发表讲话指出，国会第十一次会议通过的新宪法将更加鼓舞越南北方人民积极建设社会主义，更加鼓舞南越人民为争取民主、自由和实现祖国的统一而斗争。
    胡志明主席号召越南人民努力增加生产，厉行节约，促进各项工作，加强争取统一祖国的斗争。胡志明主席的讲话不断为全场的掌声和欢呼声所打断。
    在胡志明主席讲话之前，由越南各界人民、少数民族、归国越侨、从南越集结到北越的人民等组成的代表团向国会第十一次会议表示祝贺。越南祖国战线河内市委员会主席尹继善代表这个代表团在会上致词，热烈祝贺国会通过新宪法。他说，全国人民在胡志明主席的领导下，将紧密地团结起来，实现新宪法，完成1960年国家的重大任务，促进北方的社会主义建设。
    今天下午的会议在一致通过了国会选举法之后，通过了关于越南第二届国会的南越代表问题的决议。
    决议谴责南越当局拒绝举行普选，严重破坏日内瓦协议，破坏祖国的统一事业。决议指出，越南是一个统一的国家，越南国会代表越南全国人民的意志。在国会中必须有南越人民的代表。现在国会中的南越人民的代表，是南越人民在抗法战争初期选举出来的，他们曾同南越人民并肩进行过英勇的抗战。他们的声音就是南越人民的声音。在南越人民不能像越南北方人民一样进行自由普选的情况下，在国会里有南越人民的代表，这象征着祖国的统一。决议决定延长越南第一届国会的南越代表的任期，直到作出新的决议时为止。
    胡志明主席和孙德胜委员长在会议一致通过了这项决议后相继发言，他们代表越南劳动党、政府和国会，热烈欢迎这项决议，并且指出这项决议体现了全体越南人民的骨肉感情以及他们的意志和愿望。
    会议通过的关于执行宪法的决议责成国会常务委员会和部长会议在1960年上半年举行第二届国会代表的选举。
    在孙德胜委员长致闭幕词后，越南国会第十一次会议宣告胜利闭幕。
    今天下午，成千上万的河内各界人民聚集在国会会场（河内大剧院）门前的广场上，热烈欢呼国会通过新宪法。以胡志明主席为首的越南党政领导人走上大剧院的后台上，同群众见了面。
