    News of Spring
    Chen Zhiyan
    Night falls, and all is quiet. The bustling, vibrant Wangfujing Street has fallen silent. Outside, the mercury in the thermometer has dropped to minus ten degrees Celsius. Looking out the window, the rooftops, lined up like combs, are covered in glistening white snow.
    This is true winter, the peak of winter in Beijing. But in our editorial office, it is now filled with news of spring. On one side of our desk lies the news bulletin on the state of the national economy in 1959. Read it, recite it aloud; it will tell you how the courageous and hardworking Chinese people have taken another giant step in the past year. The total value of industrial and agricultural output increased by 31.1% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, with industrial output increasing by 39.3% and agricultural output increasing by 16.7%. Perhaps the percentages don’t immediately give a clear impression, so let's look at the absolute figures of several major products. Our eyes are always looking forward; we are not very accustomed to looking back at past records. But for the sake of comparison, let's turn the pages back. In 1959, steel production increased by 5.35 million tons compared to 1958, equivalent to more than 30 times the total steel production of our country in 1949. Coal production increased by more than 77 million tons, more than double the total coal production of our country in 1949. Although 1959 was a year of major disasters, the annual grain output was almost equal to the sum of the two highest pre-Liberation production years. Cotton production was several million dan more than the total output from 1949 to 1951. The main products such as steel, coal, grain and cotton all exceeded the original targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule.
    These figures shine with the light of our people's labor, wisdom, and strength. But are we excited and moved only by these figures? No. Compared with our great ideals, the level we have reached is only the first peak; the highest peak is still ahead. What fills our hearts with joy and gives us infinite confidence in the future is the general line formulated by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, which has created a great situation of continuous high-speed Great Leap Forward. And this situation will definitely continue to develop.
    The far-reaching significance of this situation, and how quickly it will bring China to a higher realm, may not be immediately clear to everyone, but that doesn't matter. The facts will make it clearer and clearer. The Great Leap Forward in the past two years has greatly broadened people's horizons, and more and more people have realized that the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have opened up an unprecedented situation for the great development of our country's productive forces, adding new glory to the eternally shining Marxism.
    But 1960 has only just begun. What is the outlook? In our editorial office, the good news flying in like snowflakes from many factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, Anshan, and other places tells us that they have already completed their plans for the first ten days and the middle ten days of January, or even the entire month of January ahead of schedule. This indicates that the situation in 1960 is as good as in 1959, or even better. This is news of spring, a forecast of continued leap forward.
    The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes have united 650 million heroic people like a rock. People are increasingly trusting the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and people's ambitions are becoming more and more firm. Compared with the past thousands and tens of thousands of years in human history, the bourgeoisie has also accomplished a leap forward in the development of productive forces, but it took them almost three hundred years. And we are the proletariat, the bravest, most capable, and smartest class. Compared with the bourgeoisie, we will surpass it ten thousand times. Why can't we realize a great leap in productive forces in a few decades, completely turn China upside down, and become a modern, prosperous, and wealthy socialist power? We certainly can. Even though the gentlemen in the West don't believe it, what does it matter? Thirteen years ago, when we retreated from Yan'an, we said: Our army will win, and Chiang's army will be defeated. At that time, reactionaries all over the world sneered. But only two years later, the People's Republic of China stood tall in the East. They didn't believe it, but there was nothing they could do. Now they don't believe that we can catch up with Britain in ten years and realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, science, and culture as soon as possible. Well, let them wait, and time will explain it to them.
    A spring of vibrant colors is coming towards us. Let us go all out and devote more heroic labor and more wisdom to a greater harvest this year!

    春天的消息
    陈之衍
    夜阑人静。繁华的、活跃的王府井大街已经沉默起来。室外，寒暑表的水银柱落到零下十度，从窗户里遥望，鳞次栉比的屋顶上是一片片晶莹的白雪。
    这是真正的冬天，北京的冬天的顶点。可是在我们的编辑室里，现在是充满了春天的消息。在我们案头的一边放着1959年国民经济发展情况的新闻公报。读吧，高声地朗诵吧，它会告诉你，敢想敢干的中国人民，在过去一年中，又跨过了多么巨大的一步。工农业总产值比大跃进的1958年又增长了31．1％，其中工业总产值增长了39．3％，农业总产值增长了16．7％。也许比例不容易让人一下得到一个清晰的印象，那末我们看看几项主要产品的绝对数字吧。我们的眼睛总是朝前看的，我们已不大习惯去翻阅过去的纪录。可是为了比较还是翻翻吧。1959年，比1958年增产了五百三十五万吨钢，等于1949年我国全部钢产量的三十多倍。增产了七千七百多万吨煤，比1949年我国的全部煤产量还要多一倍多。1959年虽然是个大灾年，但是一年的粮食产量，差不多赶上了解放前最高产量年两年的总和。棉花的产量，比1949年到1951年三年产量的总和还多几百万担。钢、煤、粮、棉等主要产品都提前三年超额完成了第二个五年计划的原定指标。
    这些数字闪耀着我国人民劳动、智慧和力量的光芒，然而使我们兴奋和激动的仅仅是这些数字吗？不。和我们远大的理想比较起来，我们已经达到的水平，还只是第一个山峰，高峰还在前面。使我们心胸畅阔，对前程充满了无限信心的是党和毛泽东同志制定的总路线，创造了连续高速度大跃进的伟大局面。而且这个局面肯定地要继续发展下去。
    这个局面的出现有多么深远的意义，它将多快地把中国带到多高的境界，可能有人还一下看不清楚，但这是不要紧的，事实会让人们越来越看清楚的。连续两年的大跃进，已经大大提高了人们的眼界，越来越多的人已经认识到：中国共产党和毛泽东同志为我国生产力的大发展开辟了一个史无前例的局面，为光芒永耀的马克思主义增加了新的光辉。
    可是1960年毕竟是刚刚开始，前景究竟怎么样？在我们的编辑室里，雪片般地从北京、天津、哈尔滨、鞍山等地的许多工厂里飞来的捷报告诉我们：他们已经提前完成1月上中旬甚至1月份的计划，这提示人们：1960年的情况和1959年一样好，甚至要更好些。这是一个春天的消息，是继续跃进的预告。
    总路线、大跃进、人民公社，磐石般地团结了六亿五千万英勇的人民，人们越来越信赖党中央和毛泽东同志了，人们的雄心大志越来越坚定了。和人类历史上过去了的几千年几万年相比较，资产阶级在生产力的发展上也完成了一个跃进，可是他们用了差不多三百年时间。而我们是无产阶级，是最勇敢、最能干、最聪明的一个阶级，和资产阶级比起来，我们要胜过它一万倍。为什么我们不能在几十年的时间中，实现生产力的大飞跃，把中国彻底翻转过来，成为一个现代化的、繁荣的、富裕的社会主义强国呢？我们是一定能够的。尽管西方的大人先生们还不相信这一点，那又有什么关系呢？十三年前，当我们从延安撤退的时候，我们说：我军必胜，蒋军必败。那时全世界的反动派都在一旁冷笑。可是仅仅过了两年多，中华人民共和国就屹立在世界的东方，不相信也没有办法了。现在他们不相信我们能够十年内赶上英国，能够尽快地实现工业、农业和科学文化的现代化，那末就等着吧，时间会向他们说明的。
    千红万紫的春天正在向我们走来，让我们鼓足干劲，为着今年更大的丰收付出更英勇的劳动和更多的智慧吧！
