TASS Leningrad dispatch: Professor Stanyukovich, the leader of the Soviet comprehensive expedition team that searched for snowmen in the Pamir Plateau, believes that there is no basis for the existence of snowmen in the Pamir Plateau.

    In order to verify the widespread legends about snowmen after the ascent of Mount Everest, Hillary Peak, and Tenzing Peak in the Himalayas in 1958, the Soviet Union organized a comprehensive expedition team. The team included botanists, zoologists, archaeologists, and ethnologists. Famous mountaineers and local hunters also participated in the work, and the team also brought well-trained police dogs.

    The expedition team conducted multiple detailed surveys in the vast area of central Pamir for nine months and established observation posts equipped with telescopes and other modern optical instruments. The team used more than twenty goats and sheep as bait and laid nets and anesthetics, but no snowmen were found. Zoologists and hunters repeatedly found traces of wolves, bears, snow leopards, wild cats, and ibex, but found no trace of snowmen.

    After collecting and studying many valuable materials, ethnologists concluded that the legends about snowmen are the same as the legends about the "Ghulbi-Yavan" desert people that have existed for more than a thousand years.

    苏联综合考察队队长认为
    帕米尔高原没有雪人
    据塔斯社列宁格勒消息：曾经在帕米尔高原上找寻过雪人的苏联综合考察队队长斯塔纽科维奇教授认为，在帕米尔高原上有雪人存在是没有任何根据的。
    为了证实在1958年登上喜马拉雅山的珠穆朗玛峰、希拉里峰和坦辛加峰后广泛流传的关于雪人的传说，苏联组织了综合考察队。参加考察队的有植物学家、动物学家、考古学家和人种学家。著名的登山运动员和当地的猎人也参加了工作，考察队还携带了训练有素的警犬。
    考察队在帕米尔中部的广大地区进行了为期九个月的多次细致考察，还建立了用望远镜和其它现代化光学仪器进行观察的掩蔽站。考察队放了二十多只山羊和绵羊做诱惑物，布下了网，撒下了麻醉物，但是雪人没有找到。动物学家和猎人多次找到了狼、熊、雪豹、野猫和羱羊的足迹，但是丝毫也没有发现雪人的痕迹。
    人种学家在收集并研究了许多很有意义的材料后得出了结论：关于雪人的传说，就是一千多年来一直存在的关于“古尔比—亚万”沙漠人的传说。
