Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th. The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today condemning U.S. President Eisenhower's State of the Union address to Congress, and exposed the conspiracies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

The editorial pointed out that Eisenhower said some things in his State of the Union address that seemed to advocate for peace, but this was not from his heart. It only means that the United States can no longer stubbornly resist the general trend of international tensions easing.

"Akahata" pointed out that, however, the United States is not reconciled to this state. It still insists on a Cold War policy and strengthens its military system aimed at attacking the socialist camp, dreaming of regaining its military advantage. Eisenhower still indicated in his address that he would allocate a large amount of military spending.

When "Akahata" discussed the fact that Japanese reactionary forces welcomed the address's expression that the United States would cooperate with Western European countries and Japan to provide economic "aid" to underdeveloped countries, it pointed out that the reason the Japanese reactionary forces are so "ecstatic" is that the U.S. plan conforms to the Japanese reactionary forces' imperialist ambitions to carry out economic aggression against Southeast Asian countries while dependent on the United States, and to re-establish the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

"Akahata" pointed out that the so-called U.S.-Japan "economic cooperation" can only deepen Japan's economic dependence on the United States, and will at the same time invite even more fierce attacks on the Japanese working class. Therefore, in the struggle against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," it is necessary to strengthen the exposure of the traitorous essence of the Japanese reactionary forces carrying out U.S.-Japan "economic cooperation," and strive to crush this conspiracy.

    日共“赤旗报”评美国国情咨文
    艾森豪威尔空谈和平坚持冷战
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，谴责美国总统艾森豪威尔在国会发表的国情咨文，并且揭露美日反动派的阴谋。
    社论指出，艾森豪威尔在国情咨文中说了一些好像是主张和平的话，这并非出于他的本心，这只是意味着美国已经不能顽抗国际紧张局势趋向缓和的大势。
    “赤旗报”指出，但是，美国并不甘心于这种状态，它仍然要坚持冷战政策，并且加强以攻击社会主义阵营为目的的军事体系，梦想挽回军事优势。艾森豪威尔在咨文中仍然表明要拨出大量军事开支。
    “赤旗报”在谈到日本反动势力欢迎咨文中表示美国将同西欧国家和日本合作对不发达国家给予经济“援助”一事时指出，日本反动势力所以要“狂喜”，是因为美国的计划符合日本反动势力在依附美国的情况下向东南亚各国进行经济侵略、重新建立“大东亚共荣圈”的帝国主义野心。
    “赤旗报”指出，所谓美日“经济合作”只能加深日本在经济方面对美国的从属性，同时将会招致对日本工人阶级的更加凶猛的攻击。因此，在反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争中，必须加强揭露日本反动势力进行美日“经济合作”的卖国本质，争取粉碎这种阴谋。
