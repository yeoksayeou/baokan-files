Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 9th: The Jiancaoping Store in Taiyuan City, whose primary task is supplying the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, has made excellent achievements in supporting the great leap forward in steel production over the past year. Currently, the store's employees are carrying out a "learn from Tongjialiang, catch up with Tongjialiang" (Tongjialiang Mining Area Store in Datong City, Shanxi) competition to do a better job of supplying goods during the Spring Festival so that steelworkers can enjoy the holiday.

This store spares no effort to organize sources of goods and supply materials and equipment needed for the production and construction of Taiyuan Iron and Steel, regardless of size or quantity. In this regard, they have adopted four methods: First, sending people out to purchase. Last year, in order to timely supply the urgent materials needed by Taiyuan Iron and Steel, they sent people out more than 50 times, traveling through 14 provinces, and purchased more than 1,100 kinds of urgently needed materials. Second, organizing mutual adjustment among factories. The store's supply station has established a collaboration platform and has established contacts with various factories and mines in the city. The purchasing personnel of each factory put forward urgently needed materials and the materials in stock that can be provided for adjustment to the supply station, which is responsible for adjustment. Third, organizing factories and people's communes to process. From January to October last year, the supply station successively signed contracts with Taiyuan Standard Parts Factory, Railway Factory, Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, etc., and processed 75 tons of equipment such as iron shovels, steel hammers, screw bolts, and hoes. At the same time, the people's commune was organized to produce materials such as carrying poles, shoulder poles, carrying baskets, shovel handles, and axe handles; Fourth, widely collect waste materials and modify and process them into useful things.

After taking these measures, the store supplied more than 700 kinds of production materials to Taiyuan Iron and Steel last year, and the monthly supply amount increased from 8,000 yuan to nearly one million yuan. The workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel are very grateful for the support of the store employees. They wrote in the good news report sent to the store: In every ton of steel we produce, your glorious labor is injected.

The store's work in providing services for the daily lives of Taiyuan Iron and Steel employees is also improving day by day. They have increased the number of outlets to 96 and established a non-staple food supply station specifically serving the 78 collective food service units of Taiyuan Iron and Steel. At the same time, 35 part-time and night stalls have been set up, mobile supply carts have been set up in workshops and construction sites, and 34 resident consignment shops have been set up in employee dormitory areas. A commercial network (including service industries) combining fixed supply and mobile supply has been formed, so that employees of Taiyuan Iron and Steel can easily buy general daily necessities. In terms of service methods, on the basis of the original door-to-door delivery, out-of-stock registration, telephone ordering, consignment sales, and retail sales, 39 new service methods such as door-to-door haircuts, meal delivery at construction sites, and processing meals for customers have been added.

With the assistance of the street office and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, the store also established a residents' economic life guidance committee, organized more than 680 employees' family members to establish 19 life service stations and 115 service groups, with a total of 32 service items, ranging from handling weddings and funerals to taking care of stoves, everything is available. The establishment of these service stations has greatly reduced the burden of housework for employees. In addition to raising pigs and growing vegetables themselves, the store also assists factories and employees' families in developing non-staple food production and storing vegetables, so that every factory has a vegetable cellar and every household has a jar of vegetables.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 9th: The employees of the Tongjialiang Mining Area Store in Datong City, Shanxi Province, an advanced unit in the national industrial and mining area and forest area commercial work, are actively learning from the advanced experiences of brother units with the spirit of not being proud and not being complacent.

Wei Hongshun, the secretary of the Party branch of the store who attended the National Heroes Congress, introduced to the store's employees the advanced experiences of the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store in improving business management, the Harbin Department Store sales clerk Gu Renlian's consideration of customers' psychology and enthusiastic service for customers, and the Chongqing Shijingpo Store's development of non-staple food production. The employees were greatly inspired and put forward the slogan of "learning from Tianqiao, catching up with Renlian, and learning from Shijingpo Store," and enthusiastically learned their experiences. To this end, the Party branch secretary, store manager, labor union chairman, Communist Youth League branch secretary, and model salesman of the underground store, a total of nine people, also formed a study and promotion of advanced experience promotion committee.

After research, the Advanced Experience Promotion Committee concentrated the experience of brother units, aimed at the weak links of the store, formulated a set of learning methods, earnestly implemented them, and regularly checked them. According to the experience of Tianqiao Department Store, they formulated measures to strengthen the management of capital quotas and improve transportation efficiency to ensure that the expense level in 1960 is 15% lower than in 1959. Learning from the experience of Shijingpo Store, they bought back more than 700 sheep and ducks each, and more than 500 rabbits for breeding, and closely cooperated with the coal mine and the commune management area to prepare for a large-scale livestock and poultry farm to raise pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, and rabbits, striving to catch up with or exceed Shijingpo. They are also preparing to use the method of drilling wells to send steam, use boilers to generate steam above the wells, and send it to the wells through pipes for heating meals, boiling water, and soups to supply the underground workers.

    千方百计供应生产资料　全心全意提高服务水平
    尖草坪商店猛追“同家梁”
    同家梁商店不断争上游认真学习兄弟单位先进经验
    据新华社太原9日电　以对太原钢铁公司供应为主要任务的太原市尖草坪商店，一年多来在支援钢铁生产大跃进方面做出了良好的成绩。目前，这个商店的职工正在开展“学同家梁、赶同家梁”（山西大同市同家梁矿区商店）竞赛，以较大的力量做好春节期间的供应工作，使钢铁工人欢度节日。
    这个商店对太钢生产建设需要的器材物资，不论大小多寡，都是不遗余力地组织货源，做好供应。在这方面，他们采取了四种办法：第一，派人外出采购。去年，他们为了及时供应太钢的急需物资，曾经派人外出五十多次，走过十四个省，采购到急需物资共一千一百多种；第二，组织各厂互相调剂。商店的供应站建立了协作台，与本市各厂矿都取得了联系。各厂采购人员向供应站提出急需物资和本厂库存可以提供调剂的物资，由供应站负责调剂。第三，组织工厂和人民公社加工。去年1月到10月，供应站先后与太原标准件厂、铁路工厂、量具刃具厂等工厂订立合同，加工了铁锨、钢锤、螺丝栓、镐头等器材达七十五吨。同时，组织人民公社生产了抬杆、扁担、抬筐、锹把、斧把等物资；第四，广泛收集废料，改制加工成有用的东西。
    经过采取这些办法以后，商店在去年供应太钢的生产资料共达七百多种，每月供应额由以前的八千元增加到将近一百万元。太钢工人对于商店职工的支援非常感谢，他们在送给商店的喜报上写道：在我们生产的每一吨钢里，都注入了你们的光荣劳动。
    商店为太钢职工生活服务的工作也日益改善。他们将门市部增加到九十六个，成立了专为太钢七十八个集体伙食单位服务的副食品供应站。同时，设立了业余和夜间小卖部三十五个，在车间和工地设置了流动供应车，在职工宿舍区设立了三十四个居民代销店。形成一个固定供应和流动供应相结合的商业网（包括服务业），使太钢职工都可以很方便地买到一般生活用品。在服务方法上，他们在原来送货上门、缺货登记、电话购货、代客寄卖、拆整零售的基础上，又新增加了登门理发、工地送饭、代客加工饭菜等三十九种服务方式。
    这个商店还在街道办事处和太原钢铁公司的协助下，成立了居民经济生活指导委员会，组织六百八十多名职工家属成立了十九个生活服务站和一百一十五个服务小组，服务项目共达三十二种，大至代办婚丧大事，小至照看火炉，样样俱全。这些服务站成立后，大大减轻了职工们的家务负担。商店除了自己养猪种菜以外，还协助工厂和职工家属发展副食品生产和储存蔬菜，做到厂厂有菜窖，一户一缸菜。
    据新华社太原9日电　全国工矿区和林区商业工作的先进单位——山西省大同市同家梁矿区商店的职工，本着不骄傲、不自满的精神，积极学习兄弟单位的先进经验。
    出席全国群英会的代表、这个商店的党支部书记魏洪顺从北京回来后，向商店职工介绍了北京天桥百货商场改善经营管理，哈尔滨市百货公司售货员顾仁莲体贴顾客心理、热心为顾客服务，重庆市石井坡商店发展副食品生产等先进经验。职工们受到很大启发，提出“学天桥、赶仁莲、向石井坡商店看齐”的口号，热情地学习他们的经验。为此，党支部书记、商店经理、工会主席、团支部书记和井下门市部的模范售货员一共九人，还组成了学习和推广先进经验促进委员会。
    先进经验促进委员会经过研究，集中了兄弟单位的经验，针对本店的薄弱环节，制定出一套学习办法，认真执行，并且定时检查。他们根据天桥百货商场的经验，制定了加强资金定额管理、提高运输效率的措施，保证1960年的费用水平比1959年降低15％；学习石井坡商店的经验，买回羊、鸭各七百多只、兔五百多只饲养，并且与煤矿和公社管理区密切协作，筹办大型养畜养禽场，饲养猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭、兔，力争赶上或超过石井坡。他们还准备根据钻井送汽的办法，在井上用锅炉烧出蒸汽，通过管子送到井下，用来热饭菜、开水和羹汤，供应井下工人。
