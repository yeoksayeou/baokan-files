    Yancheng Special District People Advance Victoriously, Slogans Resound:
    “Leap Out of Yancheng, Catch Up with Jiangnan!”
    (Our report) The four million people of Yancheng Special District, Jiangsu Province, on the basis of two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, have now boldly proposed a new goal of "Leaping Out of Yancheng, Catching Up with Jiangnan!" They are striving to fully catch up with and surpass the Suzhou Special District in Jiangnan within two to three years. Yancheng Special District is located in northern Jiangsu, historically a poor area with barren land and impoverished people. The people's economic and cultural level is behind the Suzhou Special District on the south bank of the Yangtze River. In the past two years, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the Yancheng area have carried out large-scale farmland capital construction and achieved great harvests for two consecutive years. Compared with 1957, the total grain output in 1959 increased by 38.1%, cotton increased by 64.5%, and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries are also advancing vigorously and by leaps and bounds.

    The continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years has brought great changes to agricultural production in the entire region, and the distance from the Suzhou area is getting smaller and smaller. The ideal of catching up with Jiangnan in the past has now become a reality that can be expected soon. The Yancheng Prefectural Party Committee, standing at the forefront of the mass movement, led the masses in continuous revolution, and promptly put forward the slogan "Establish Lofty Ambitions, Make Great Aspirations, Leap Out of Yancheng, Catch Up with Jiangnan," and decided to make catching up with Jiangnan the specific goal for developing agricultural production in the entire region in the next two to three years. The general requirement is: "Get close in one year, catch up in two years, and surpass in three years." This slogan reflects both the reality of the two consecutive years of Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in the entire region and the common aspirations and demands of the more than four million people in the region. It further deepens the Party's leadership and the general line, better leverages the superiority of the people's communes, and better mobilizes the enthusiasm of the masses.

    In order to realize the grand ambition of "Leaping Out of Yancheng, Catching Up with Jiangnan," the Party organizations at all levels in the Yancheng area, in accordance with the spirit of combining lofty ideals with specific measures, and combining general calls with individual guidance, have found specific paths for catching up with Jiangnan in stages, in batches, and item by item: first create "small Jiangnans," and then fully catch up with Jiangnan. This is to divide catching up with Jiangnan into several major battles. In the past two years, many communes and teams in the seven counties of the entire special district have approached or caught up with Jiangnan in terms of overall and individual production levels. For example, Jianhu County has more than 30,000 mu of high-yield fields yielding 700 to 1,000 jin or more, nine 1,000-jin production teams, and 108 production teams yielding 800 jin or more. Bufeng Commune in Yancheng County has had a very low yield in the past. Since communization, it has vigorously improved saline-alkali soil, and the per-mu yield of grain has increased from more than 300 jin in 1957 to more than 600 jin. The many "small Jiangnans" that have already appeared are like many bright red flags, greatly encouraging the people of the entire region to catch up with Jiangnan. Now, each county has selected a commune, each commune has selected a brigade, each brigade has selected a production team, and each production team has selected a piece of field as the object of creating "small Jiangnans." These "small Jiangnans" are comprehensive and individual, and the specifications and measures in all aspects are of high standards. At the same time, the leadership has organized forces to process and cultivate key points, striving to make "small Jiangnans" catch up with Jiangnan within one year, and make "small Jiangnans" become the locomotives driving the entire movement to catch up with Jiangnan.

    While creating "small Jiangnans," Party organizations at all levels in the special district have adopted the method of launching a mass movement, concentrating efforts on carrying out five basic agricultural constructions, creating a solid material foundation for catching up with Jiangnan. First, continue to vigorously develop water conservancy. Different requirements are put forward according to different conditions and different situations in the whole region. In the eastern coastal areas, focus on solving the problems of drainage, irrigation, and alkali washing in some low-lying areas; in the northern dryland areas, continue to renovate channels, consolidate and develop the results of converting dry land to paddy fields; in the western water network areas, take vigorous development of mechanized and electrical irrigation as the center, and整治small-scale farmland water conservancy; in the northern and southeastern highlands, mainly digging rivers and ponds to solve the problem of drought resistance and irrigation, and strive to realize the mechanization and electrification of irrigation and drainage in paddy fields this year, and basically eliminate general drought and flood disasters throughout the region, ensuring increased production. Second, taking fine fertilizer as the key link, combining fine fertilizer and coarse fertilizer, vigorously carry out the fertilizer accumulation movement. The first is to vigorously grasp pig raising. This spring, the whole region will achieve one pig for every two people, and at the end of the year, one pig per person will be achieved. Secondly, vigorously grasp green manure and expand green manure fields. Continue to accumulate a large amount of natural fertilizer, so that there are fertilizer ponds in every field. Third, carry out a mass soil improvement movement. Strive to improve the saline-alkali land in the existing cultivated land this year, and at the same time actively reclaim wasteland and expand the cultivated area. Fourth, continue to select, cultivate and vigorously promote fine varieties. Counties, communes, and teams universally build fine seed bases, striving to basically realize the use of fine seeds this year. Fifth, actively carry out tool reform, and strive to basically realize the mechanization and electrification of paddy field irrigation and drainage this year, realize the semi-mechanization of harvesting and threshing, and create conditions for the gradual realization of agricultural modernization.

    After the slogan "Leaping Out of Yancheng, Catching Up with Jiangnan" was put forward, it was enthusiastically responded to by the broad masses of people in the entire region, and the winter and spring production and construction movements were rapidly pushed to a new climax. The entire Yancheng Special District is now a scene of boiling activity everywhere. More than 1.8 million laborers are investing in the first battle to catch up with Jiangnan with an overwhelming force. In the past month or so, brilliant victories have been achieved. The field management of 5.1 million mu of wheat, 1.04 million mu of green manure, and 400,000 mu of rapeseed in the entire region has established a professional team of more than 400,000 people, rushing to top-dress, straighten ridges, and control pests. More than 390,000 commune members fighting on water conservancy construction sites have completed nearly 40 million cubic meters of earthwork. The winter and spring fertilizer accumulation movement, which is mainly based on developing pig raising and planting green manure, has made rapid progress. The number of pigs raised in the entire region has increased from 1.03 million at the end of October last year to 1.23 million. In terms of soil improvement, more than 470,000 mu of saline-alkali soil has been improved, accounting for 14% of the entire winter and spring task. Dongtai, Dafeng, Binhai and other counties along the coast have also organized a certain number of tractors to reclaim more than 100,000 mu of wasteland. The winter and spring production movement in the entire region is developing forward with an increasingly fierce trend.

    盐城专区人民乘胜前进口号响亮
    “跳出盐城赶江南！”
    本报讯　江苏盐城专区四百多万人民，在两年连续大跃进的基础上，又豪迈地提出了“跳出盐城赶江南”的新的奋斗目标。他们力争在两三年内全面赶上和超过江南的苏州专区。盐城专区位于江苏北部，历史上是个地瘠民贫的地区，人民经济和文化水平比长江南岸的苏州专区落后。近两年来，盐城地区人民在党的领导下，进行了巨大规模的农田基本建设工作，两年连续获得大丰收。以1959年的总产量与1957年比较，粮食增长38．1％，棉花增长64．5％，林牧副渔生产也在蓬勃地飞跃前进。
    两年来的连续大跃进，使全区农业生产起了很大的变化，和苏州地区的距离正越来越小。过去赶江南的理想，现在成为指日可待的现实了。中共盐城地委站在群众运动的最前面，领导群众不断革命，及时地提出了“树雄心，立大志，跳出盐城赶江南”的口号，决定把赶江南作为全区今后两三年内发展农业生产的具体奋斗目标。总的要求是：“一年接近，两年赶上，三年超过。”这个口号既反映了全区农业生产两年继续大跃进的现实，又反映了全区四百多万人民的共同愿望和要求，把党的领导和总路线更深地扎下根去，把人民公社的优越性更好地发挥起来，把群众的积极性更好地调动起来。
    为了实现“跳出盐城赶江南”的宏图大志，盐城地区各级党组织根据远大理想和具体措施相结合，一般号召和个别指导相结合的精神，找出了分期分批分项赶江南的具体道路：先创造“小江南”，然后全面赶江南。这就是把赶江南分成几个大的战役来进行。两年来，全专区七个县已有许多社、队全面和单项的生产水平接近或者赶上了江南。如建湖县有三万多亩七百斤到一千斤以上的高产田，九个千斤生产队，一百零八个八百斤以上的生产队。盐城县步凤公社历年来产量很低，由于公社化以后大力改良了盐碱土，粮食单产从1957年的三百多斤上升到六百多斤。已经出现的许多“小江南”，像许多面鲜艳夺目的红旗，给全区人民赶江南以极大的鼓舞。现在，各个县都选择了一个公社，各公社选择了一个大队，各大队选择了一个生产队，各生产队选择了一匡田，作为创造“小江南”的对象。这些“小江南”有综合的也有单项的，各方面的规格、措施都是高标准的。同时领导上又组织力量，加工培养重点，争取在一年内使“小江南”赶上江南，使“小江南”成为带动整个赶江南运动前进的火车头。
    在创造“小江南”的同时，专区的各级党组织采取大搞群众运动的办法，集中力量大搞五项农业基本建设，为赶江南创造雄厚的物质条件。第一，继续大兴水利。根据全区不同条件不同情况提出了不同的要求。东部沿海地区，着重解决部分洼地的排涝灌溉洗碱问题；北部旱田地区，继续整修渠道，巩固和发展旱改水的成果；西部水网地区，以大力发展机电灌溉为中心，整治小型农田水利；北部和东南部分高地，主要是开河挖塘，解决抗旱灌溉问题，力争在今年实现稻田灌排机电化，在全区范围内，基本上消灭一般旱涝灾害，确保增产。第二，以精肥为纲，精肥粗肥并举，大搞积肥运动。首先是狠抓养猪，今春全区实现两人一头猪，年底实现每人一头猪。其次狠抓绿肥，扩大绿肥田。继续大量积聚自然肥料，做到块块田头都有肥料塘。第三，开展群众性的改良土壤运动。争取在今年将现有熟田中的盐碱地改良过来，同时积极垦荒，扩大耕种面积。第四，继续选用、培育和大力推广良种。县、社、队普建良种基地，争取今年基本良种化。第五，积极进行工具改革，力争今年基本实现稻田排灌机电化，实现收割脱粒半机械化，并为逐步实现农业现代化创造条件。
    “跳出盐城赶江南”的口号提出以后，得到了全区广大人民群众的热烈响应，冬春各项生产建设运动迅速推向了新的高潮。整个盐城专区，现在处处都是一片沸腾景象。一百八十多万劳动力，正以排山倒海之势，投入了赶江南的第一个战役，近一个多月来，已取得辉煌的胜利。全区五百一十万亩三麦、一百零四万亩绿肥、四十万亩油菜的田间管理，已建立起四十多万人的专业队伍，突击追肥、理墒、治虫。奋战在水利工地上的三十九万多名社员，已完成了近四千万土方。以发展养猪、种植绿肥为主的冬春积肥运动进展很快，全区圈存猪数从去年10月底的一百零三万头增长到一百二十三万头。在土壤改良运动方面，已完成了四十七万多亩盐碱土的改良，占整个冬春任务的14％。沿海的东台、大丰、滨海等县还组织一定数量的拖拉机，开垦了荒地十多万亩。全区冬春生产运动正以越来越猛的趋势向前发展着。
