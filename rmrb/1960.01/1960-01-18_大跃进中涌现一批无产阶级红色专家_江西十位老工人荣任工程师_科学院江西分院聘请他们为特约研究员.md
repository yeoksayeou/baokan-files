According to Jiangxi Daily, the Jiangxi Provincial Science and Technology Association, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Provincial Communist Youth League Committee, and the Provincial Women's Federation jointly held a meeting on January 9 to warmly congratulate ten old workers, including Hong Jinshui of the Nanchang Railway Bureau, on being promoted to engineers. At the meeting, the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences hired them as special researchers. Representatives of workers from various industrial and transportation enterprises in Nanchang City and more than 3,500 employees of the Nanchang Railway Bureau attended the meeting.

The ten old workers who were honorably appointed as engineers are Hong Jinshui, Tang Chengao, Lu Weigao, Wang Enhou, Ni Meifu, Tao Chaozhu, Zhang Heqing, Zhu Jinshan, Yang Junqi, and Yin Caiting.

These ten old workers are proletarian red experts who have emerged from the Great Leap Forward in industrial construction under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line. Among them, six are Communist Party members, and five have been rated as advanced producers of the bureau or the national railway. The average length of service for these ten individuals is more than twenty years. Like other working people who came from the old society, they have suffered cruel persecution and exploitation by the reactionary ruling class and lost the opportunity to study from an early age. After liberation, under the Party's kind cultivation, through long-term class struggle, their political consciousness has continuously improved. They love the Party and the socialist cause, and they are able to fight selflessly for the collective interest. Hong Jinshui, a Communist Party member and foreman of the Nanchang Vehicle Depot who has been engaged in vehicle work for twenty-one years, was forced to work as an apprentice in a factory at the age of ten and lost his left eye due to being pricked by steel wire. Last year, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to oppose right-leaning tendencies and encourage greater efforts, he took the lead in proposing to the entire depot that they accomplish two months' worth of work in one month, leading the workers to work hard and skillfully, and exceeding the two-month car repair task by 25% in one month. These ten old workers have diligently studied and researched in their practical work, learned tenaciously, dared to think and act, and made rapid technological progress, making outstanding contributions to the railway transportation industry. Lu Weigao of the Nanchang Telecommunications Engineering Team, who used to be a cattle herder, never even crossed the threshold of a school in the old society; after liberation, under the Party's cultivation, he tenaciously studied culture and delved into technology. Now, he is not only familiar with the operational techniques of telecommunications engineering, but can also independently undertake the complex design work of erecting communication lines. Tang Chengao of the Shangrao Works Section, who came from a maintenance worker background, proposed the "sleeper stacking and rail fastening method" based on his rich production experience when repairing railway bridges damaged by floods, enabling the bridges to be quickly repaired. Wang Enhou, a fitter at the Nanchang Vehicle Depot, only attended elementary school. After more than twenty years of production labor practice, especially after liberation, he has diligently studied and now not only has rich experience in vehicle and electrical maintenance, but also created a relatively complex train generator. Others, such as Ni Meifu of the Shangrao Telecommunications Section, Tao Chaozhu and Zhang Heqing of the Pingxiang Locomotive Depot, Zhu Jinshan and Yang Junqi of the Xiangtang Locomotive Depot, and Yin Caiting of the Nanchang Works Section, have also made outstanding contributions.

At the meeting, Huang Lin, Standing Committee Member of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Minister of Communications, as well as the heads of the Provincial Science and Technology Association, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League Committee, the Women's Federation, and the Nanchang Railway Bureau, spoke and expressed warm congratulations to these ten old workers.

According to Jiangxi Daily, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee sent a congratulatory letter to the Nanchang Railway Bureau on January 9, warmly congratulating the ten old workers on being promoted to engineers. The congratulatory letter said: "The fact that these comrades can be promoted to engineers can only be achieved in our country - a country where the working class has become the master; at the same time, it is also due to the long-term education and cultivation of the Party, and because they have undergone long-term tests of class struggle and diligently studied and practiced in their practical work. Promoting workers to become engineers is an important measure to strengthen the proletarian technical ranks and an important way for us to train and promote cadres in the future. It is hoped that all fronts will promote more engineering and technical personnel from outstanding workers in the future, who are both virtuous and talented, both red and expert, so as to further strengthen the technical strength of the proletariat and strive to accelerate the socialist construction of our country!"

    大跃进中涌现一批无产阶级红色专家
    江西十位老工人荣任工程师
    科学院江西分院聘请他们为特约研究员
    据江西日报消息　江西省科学技术协会、省总工会、省团委、省妇联，于1月9日联合召开大会，热烈祝贺南昌铁路局洪锦水等十位老工人被提拔为工程师。会上，中国科学院江西分院聘请他们为特约研究员。参加会议的有南昌市各工交企业职工代表、南昌铁路局职工三千五百多人。
    这十位荣任工程师的老工人是洪锦水、唐承鳌、鲁慰镐、王恩厚、倪美富、陶朝珠、张和庆、朱进善、杨俊起、殷彩庭。
    这十位老工人，是在党的总路线光辉照耀下，从工业建设大跃进中涌现出来的无产阶级红色专家。他们当中，有六个人是共产党员，五个人曾被评为局或全国铁路的先进生产者。他们十个人平均工龄在二十年以上。他们同从旧社会过来的其它劳动人民一样，经受过反动统治阶级的残酷迫害和剥削，从小就失去读书求学的机会。解放以后，他们在党的亲切培养下，经过长期阶级斗争的锻炼，政治觉悟不断提高，热爱党、热爱社会主义事业，能够为集体利益而忘我战斗。从事车辆工作已二十一年的南昌车辆段领工员、共产党员洪锦水，十岁时就被迫到一家工厂当徒工，被钢丝扎瞎了左眼。去年党的八届八中全会发出反右倾、鼓干劲的伟大号召后，他首先向全段提出一个月干两个月活的跃进倡议，带领工人苦干巧干，一个月超额25％完成两个月的修车任务。这十位老工人在实际工作中刻苦钻研，顽强学习，敢想敢干，技术进步很快，为铁路运输事业作出了出色的贡献。曾经是放牛出身的南昌电务工程队鲁慰镐，在旧社会连学校大门也没有跨过；解放后，他在党的培养下，顽强学习文化，钻研技术，现在不仅熟习电信工程的操作技术，还能独立担任架设通信线路的复杂的设计工作。养路工出身的上饶工务段唐承鳌，以自己的丰富生产经验，在抢修被洪水冲坏的铁路桥梁时，提出“枕木垛扣轨法”建议，使桥梁很快修复。南昌车辆段钳工王恩厚，只念过小学，经过二十多年的生产劳动的实践，特别是解放后的刻苦钻研，现在，不仅具有丰富的车电检修经验，而且创制了技术比较复杂的列车发电机。其它如上饶电务段倪美富，萍乡机务段陶朝珠、张和庆，向塘机务段朱进善、杨俊起，南昌工务段殷彩庭，也都作出了出色的贡献。
    会上，中共江西省委常务委员、交通部部长黄霖同志，以及省科学技术协会、省总工会、团委、妇联和南昌铁路局的负责人发言，向这十位老工人表示热烈的祝贺。
    据江西日报消息　中共江西省委员会、江西省人民委员会1月9日在给南昌铁路局的贺信中，为十位老工人被提拔为工程师热烈祝贺。贺信说：“这些同志所以能够被提拔为工程师，这只有在我们的国家——工人阶级已经作了主人的国家里才能办得到；同时这也是由于党的长期教育和培养，由于他们经过长期的阶级斗争的考验和在实际工作中勤学苦练的结果。提拔工人当工程师，这是壮大无产阶级技术队伍的一个重要措施，是今后我们培养和提拔干部的一条重要途径，希望各个战线今后都能从优秀的工人中提拔出更多的、德才兼备的、又红又专的工程技术人员来，以进一步壮大无产阶级的技术力量，为加速我国的社会主义建设而努力奋斗！”
