　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30th: TASS was authorized on the 30th to issue a statement regarding the unprovoked attack by South Korean warships on Soviet peaceful vessels. The full text is as follows:

　　At 14:35 Moscow time on December 28, 1959, the Soviet hydrographic survey vessel "Venger" was subjected to an armed attack by the South Korean anti-submarine warfare vessel No. 205 in the East Korean Bay, at 39 degrees 87 minutes north latitude and 128 degrees 35 minutes east longitude (30 nautical miles from the coast of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and 36 nautical miles from the northeast border of South Korea).

　　Following the bandit-like attack on the unarmed Soviet vessel in international waters, the crew suffered casualties, and the vessel was severely damaged. After the attack, this South Korean warship and two other warships of the same type, which were further away, sailed back to South Korea.

　　The unprovoked attack by South Korean warships on Soviet peaceful vessels is a typical act of piracy on the high seas. This incident proves that the South Korean authorities are not committed to normalizing the situation in the Far East but are pursuing other interests that are hostile to the cause of peace. At the same time, this brazen attack on a Soviet vessel proves that the South Korean authorities clearly have no sense of reality or responsibility for what they are doing.

　　TASS is authorized to declare that the South Korean authorities bear full responsibility for the armed attack on a Soviet peaceful vessel on the high seas and warns that in the future, appropriate measures will be taken against similar provocations by ships engaged in piratical activities, in accordance with the recognized international principle of requiring all countries to take measures to eliminate piracy on the high seas, until they are annihilated.

    南朝鲜军舰无端袭击苏联和平船只
    塔斯社受权警告南朝鲜当局
    今后对于这类海盗挑衅行为将采取应有措施直到予以歼灭
    新华社莫斯科30日电　塔斯社30日受权就南朝鲜军舰无端袭击苏联和平船只发表声明，全文如下：
    1959年12月28日莫斯科时间十四时三十五分，一艘苏联“温格号”水道测量船在东朝鲜海湾、北纬三十九度八十七分和东经一百二十八度三十五分（距朝鲜民主主义人民共和国海岸三十浬、距南朝鲜东北边境三十六浬）的海面上遭到南朝鲜猎潜舰型军舰二百零五号的武装袭击。
    非武装的苏联船只在公海上遭到强盗式的袭击后，船上人员受到伤亡，船只也受到严重损害。袭击后，这艘南朝鲜军舰和离得较远的其他两艘同一类型的军舰驶回南朝鲜。
    南朝鲜军舰对苏联的和平船只的无端袭击，是公海上典型的海盗行为。这件事证明，南朝鲜当局不是致力于远东局势的正常化，而是追求另一种与和平事业相敌对的利益。同时，对苏联船只的这种无耻的袭击证明，南朝鲜当局显然没有丝毫现实感和对其所干的勾当的责任感。
    塔斯社受权声明，在公海上武装袭击苏联和平船只一事的全部责任都在南朝鲜当局身上，并提出警告：今后对于进行海盗活动的舰只的类似挑衅行为，将根据责成一切国家采取措施消灭公海上的海盗行为这一公认的国际准则，采取应有的措施，直到予以歼灭。
