The general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong and unanimously and enthusiastically supported by the entire Party and the people of the whole country, as well as the extremely important instructions such as breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, continuous revolution, and vigorously launching mass movements, have brilliantly developed Marxism-Leninism, further developed the Party's mass line, and laid the theoretical and ideological foundation for building socialism at a leaping high speed. The great people's commune movement realized in the rural areas across the country in 1958 has a huge and far-reaching significance for accelerating China's socialist construction. Under the radiant illumination of the Party's general line, for more than a year, the mass movement has been developing vigorously and enthusiastically, like ten thousand horses galloping forward.

I

For more than a year, like the national situation, the mass movement on all fronts of the Second Ministry of Machine Building has been developing universally, vigorously, and extensively. The development of the mass movement is broad, profound, and comprehensive, whether in production, capital construction, scientific research, or other work. From workers and staff directly participating in production and construction to non-production personnel, from various workshops, machines, and groups to various functional departments, and even the families of workers and staff, have all plunged into the torrent of the mass movement. The families of workers and staff organized themselves into the production movement, vigorously developing agricultural and sideline production, which not only improved the lives of workers and staff, but more importantly, enhanced the socialist ideological consciousness of the families of workers and staff. About 90% or more of the units have good and healthy development of the mass movement, and the mass movement in a few units has not been launched sufficiently. Due to the vigorous launching of mass movements, the revolutionary enthusiasm and passion for building socialism of the broad masses of workers and staff are exceptionally full and high. This has made our production, construction, and other work show a great situation of continued great leap forward. Production has been rising month by month, and plans have been generally completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. Many advanced collectives and advanced individuals have entered 1960 one or two months ahead of schedule. Taking the production of a unit under the Second Ministry of Machine Building as an example, in 1959, on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958 (1958 was equivalent to one and a half times the total achievements of the past three years), it completed the annual plan fifty days ahead of schedule, exceeding the achievements of the same period in 1958 by 86%. The situation on the capital construction front is also very good, and the achievements are also very significant. Scientific research and other work are all in a thriving situation. All work has shown a comprehensive leap forward situation of fast speed, good quality, low cost, and good safety. Especially since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the anti-rightist and boost-enthusiasm campaign and the in-depth rectification movement have been carried out, the development of the mass movement has become more rapid and violent, both extensive and profound, both vigorous and solid, showing an excellent situation of flourishing branches and leaves, and abundant harvests. All these are the results of the broad masses of workers and staff, under the leadership of the Party, resolutely implementing the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism.

The mass campaign under the unified leadership of the Party committee has not only created excellent achievements in production and construction, but also the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of workers and staff has generally been further enhanced, which can truly be called a double harvest of production and construction and political thought. Now, walking among the masses of workers and staff, everyone is smiling, in a cheerful mood, and their soaring enthusiasm and pioneering spirit give people a deep impression. Here is a specific example to illustrate the degree of socialist consciousness of the workers: the motorcade of a production unit used to only order a task of 70,000 ton-kilometers per month, and still shouted that it was difficult to complete. In 1959, they had the same number of personnel and cars, but because of putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements, "fighting a big battle in April," this motorcade completed a task of 180,000 ton-kilometers in one month. The drivers no longer wanted extra bonuses as before, but what they were fighting for was a red flag symbolizing honor. They said, "Thirty yuan is not as good as a small red flag. It is glorious to see anyone with a red flag on the car." This change in their emotions and thoughts concretely reflects the improvement of socialist ideological consciousness. There are many, many such examples in various units. At the same time, our leading cadres at all levels have also been tempered in the mass movement. All cadres and workers have grown and improved more in the great leap forward. They understand how to launch mass movements, and their confidence in completing tasks has been enhanced, and they have more methods. One unit concentrated all the captains and Party committee secretaries in October 1959 for rectification and study, and some section chiefs were in charge of leading production, and the production tasks in October were also completed very well, and the mass movement was also vigorously and solidly developing forward. The facts show that the mass movement has become a conscious action of the masses.

II

Under the unified leadership of the Party, the mass movement is flourishing, and at the same time, its roots are also developing deeper. We have gained rich experience, deepened our understanding, and improved our consciousness. In order to continuously develop the great leap forward, we must, on the existing basis, plant the ideological roots of vigorously launching mass movements deeper in all cadres. This is the central issue for us to take a deeper step in vigorously launching mass movements at present.

Vigorously launching mass movements on the industrial front is a consistent policy of the Party. As on the agricultural and other fronts, vigorously launching mass movements is the fundamental method to implement the Party's general line. As far as leading industrial enterprises is concerned, vigorously launching mass movements is a fundamental issue of a line nature. In fact, there are two mutually opposed lines in leading industrial enterprises: one is Party committee leadership, putting politics in command, and vigorously launching mass movements. By vigorously launching mass movements, we can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, do a good job in production, ensure quality and safety; by vigorously launching mass movements, we can carry out technological innovation and technological revolution; by vigorously launching mass movements, we can do a good job in industrial enterprise management, and improve the lives of workers and staff. Facts have fully proved that this is an effective line. Here, putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements has become the core issue in leading production. Such a line is the line of the proletariat leading industrial enterprises. The other line, which is opposed to this, is not to have Party leadership, not to have mass movements, and to implement technology in command. Relying on top-down administrative orders to do things, relying on "once and for all" rules and regulations to manage production, slowly and quietly. When the task is urgent, as a certain repair workshop did, issue a "hard work tomorrow" notice. Here, top-down administrative orders and management become the basis for carrying out all work, and the initiative of the workers and staff is not mobilized. Such a line is essentially a reflection of the remnants of the old capitalist system and old ideas in our enterprise management. From the bourgeois point of view, anything can only rely on a few people, but not on the masses. Rousseau, a bourgeois philosopher of the French bourgeois revolution in the eighteenth century, said: "The best and most natural way is to manage the masses with the most intelligent few." From this, it can be seen that whether or not to vigorously launch mass movements in industrial enterprises is a fundamental issue of policy and line, not a simple issue of method that may or may not be needed.

The basic spirit of the Party's general line is to mobilize the broadest masses to accelerate the process of socialist construction in our country. Vigorously launching mass movements in industrial enterprises is precisely the implementation and embodiment of the Party's general line. Without vigorously launching mass movements, the Party's general line will fall through. The great leap forward must be the result of vigorously launching mass movements. Without vigorously launching mass movements, there would be no great leap forward. What does it mean to put politics in command? How to put it in command? If mass movements are not vigorously launched, then proletarian politics is bound to be not in command. The system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee implemented in industrial enterprises requires that all major policies and policy issues must be discussed by the Party committee. However, major issues are not discussed every day. Therefore, the most central and frequent task of the Party committee is to vigorously launch mass movements. If the content of vigorously launching mass movements is removed, the leadership of the Party committee will inevitably be unable to reflect the policy and line of the proletariat leading industrial enterprises, and will inevitably fall into the bourgeois quagmire of so-called "managing the masses with the most intelligent few." From this, it is not difficult to see that the focus of the debate on how to implement the Party's general line, implement putting politics in command, realize the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, and how to strengthen enterprise management in industrial enterprises is all concentrated on the issue of whether or not to launch mass movements.

The reason why we firmly launch mass movements and regard vigorously launching mass movements as the policy and line of the proletariat leading industrial enterprises is because we firmly believe that the creativity of the people is endless. The classic writers of Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong have always taught us that history is created by the people. People are the most active factor in the productive forces. The fundamental purpose of our Party's leadership of the masses in carrying out revolution and construction is to thoroughly liberate the social productive forces and rapidly develop the social productive forces. Only by vigorously launching mass movements can we thoroughly break the shackles that bind the wisdom and strength of the broad working people, fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, and maximize the rapid development of the productive forces. Historical facts have proved that the depth and breadth of the revolution depend on the depth and breadth of the mass movement. The experience of socialist construction in our country also proves that the depth and breadth of vigorously launching mass movements determine the speed of socialist construction. Marx said: "The most powerful productive force is the revolutionary class itself." ("The Poverty of Philosophy") Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Coalition Government": "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." "Every comrade should be made to understand that as long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses of the people is inexhaustible, and therefore trust the people and become one with them, then any difficulty can be overcome." Vigorously launching mass movements has always been our Party's consistent policy, precisely based on this Marxist-Leninist view of the people, based on this historical materialist point of view. The reason why we insist on vigorously launching mass movements in industrial enterprises is precisely because building socialism is the cause of hundreds of millions of people themselves. Going all out means going all out for 650 million people, and aiming high means 650 million people aiming high. Only by relying on the consciousness and automation of the broad masses of the people can we build socialism. The higher the socialist consciousness of the people, the more the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses are developed, the more the cause of socialist construction develops. Lenin said well, "Vigorous and creative socialism is created by the people themselves." ("Meeting of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee") Comrade Liu Shaoqi also wrote in "On the Party": "All the undertakings of us communists are the undertakings of the masses of the people. … Everything of ours depends on and is determined by the consciousness and automation of the masses of the people. Without relying on the consciousness and automation of the masses, we will accomplish nothing and be unrewarded for our efforts." Vigorously launching mass movements in industrial enterprises starts from such a standpoint and point of view. This is also the ideological basis and theoretical basis for us to vigorously launch mass movements in all our work.

The historical experience of our Party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction proves that, under the leadership of the Party, the idea of vigorously launching mass movements is the guarantee of the invincibility of Comrade Mao Zedong and the correct line he represents. During the democratic revolution period, the Party vigorously launched mass movements in the rural areas, fully mobilized the masses, and improved the class consciousness and political and ideological consciousness of the broad masses, established, consolidated, and developed the rural revolutionary base areas, and thoroughly eliminated the feudal landlord class. During the period of socialist revolution, the Party also comprehensively launched the agricultural cooperativization movement and the great people's commune movement in 1958. These are all revolutionary movements of hundreds of millions of people, which are the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the democratic revolution and socialist revolution. For example, in military work, establishing the policy of vigorously launching mass movements under the leadership of the Party committee has established a new type of people's army with unity between officers and soldiers and unity between the army and the people, transformed the old army, and relied on the strength of the mass movement to realize political democracy, military democracy, and economic democracy within the troops, making this army invincible, "no enemy can overwhelm us, but will only be overwhelmed by us." (Mao Zedong: "On Coalition Government") For example, on the industrial front, before 1952, vigorously launching mass movements to carry out democratic reforms relatively thoroughly broke down the old capitalist system within industrial enterprises and improved the class consciousness and political and ideological consciousness of the broad masses of workers and staff. Especially in 1958, breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, vigorously launching mass movements, and implementing a series of two-legged walking policies such as simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises, and simultaneously using foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production, the whole people invested in the upsurge of building socialism, and the face of the industrial front was even more renewed. The facts vividly show that the thoroughly liberated 650 million people have stepped onto the political stage, become masters of their own affairs, and urgently demand to rapidly change the situation of "poverty and blankness" and accelerate socialist construction. This is an incomparably powerful driving force, and we must see this great power. The correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong precisely concentrates and reflects the wishes of the broad masses, and it is mastered by the masses, and a vigorous great leap forward situation appears.

Some people are not clear enough about whether or not to continuously launch mass movements. After a period of mass movement, some people say, "It's almost done. If we continue like this, when will it end?" They are afraid of being nervous and do not allow the mass movement to continue. We believe that these are "limited revolutionists." This kind of thinking is because they have not correctly reflected the objective law of continuous development of things, and therefore they have not understood the meaning of continuously launching mass movements. Our working class is the most thorough revolutionary class. Although we have completed the democratic revolution, we must carry the socialist revolution to the end, and we must build a socialist society and a communist society. "The working class must transform the entire society in the class struggle and in the struggle with nature, and at the same time transform itself." (Mao Zedong: "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") The working class's battle cry should be "continuous revolution." In the future, the revolution of the relationship between people, the revolution of the relationship between people and nature, will never stop, only different from the revolution in class society.
  "In socialist and communist societies, the phenomena of technological innovation and social system innovation will inevitably continue to occur" ("Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat"). Since we are Marxist-Leninist continuous revolutionists, since we must continuously carry out revolution and construction, we will naturally continuously launch mass movements (of course, this does not deny the stage of revolutionary development). It can be seen that the theory of continuous revolution is also the ideological basis and theoretical basis for us to continuously launch mass movements.

Is it better to vigorously launch mass movements, or is it better to moderately or slightly launch mass movements? Our answer is that it is better to vigorously launch mass movements. However, among some cadres, some advocate small-scale or medium-scale movements and do not approve of large-scale movements. On the one hand, they want revolution, but they are afraid of making trouble and having shortcomings, and they dare not let go and mobilize the masses. After the masses rise up, they have endless worries and even restrict the mass movement. This view is wrong. If you want revolution and construction, you must vigorously launch mass movements, and you cannot be afraid of producing shortcomings. The revolutionary mass movement is not embroidery, and it is inevitable to produce some temporary shortcomings. The relationship between the achievements we have made and the shortcomings in our work is only the relationship between nine fingers and one finger, or the shortcomings do not even account for one finger. Taking a step back, even if the shortcomings account for two or three fingers, we cannot deny the achievements because of this. The idea of requiring the revolutionary mass movement to be smooth and not produce any shortcomings is naive and childish. The most important thing for us Marxists is to see the most important and essential achievements in the mass movement, to see the new and emerging things, and to nurture, promote, and popularize them. Of course, the new things are not perfect at the beginning and need to be constantly enriched in the mass movement. This is our responsibility to lead the mass movement.

Some people think that modern industry has a high degree of mechanization and automation, which is changing rapidly and requires a high degree of centralization and unity, so mass movements cannot be vigorously launched. This view is wrong. Modern industrial enterprises have a high degree of mechanization and automation, and they require a high degree of centralization and unity. This is a fact, but it does not exclude vigorously launching mass movements. It is precisely on the basis of vigorously launching mass movements that unifying thinking and unifying actions will be more conducive to centralization and unity. The army needs centralization and unity the most when fighting. The army can vigorously launch mass movements. Can't industrial and mining enterprises? Some people criticize us, saying that the vigorous launch of mass movements in industrial enterprises now is to restore the extremely backward system of leading industrial enterprises before 1952, which is a rural style and guerrilla habits. This criticism is not correct. Before 1952, it was indeed a stage of democratic reform in industrial and mining enterprises to vigorously launch mass movements. This is not something backward, but a glorious tradition of the mass line. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in an important conversation with reporters from Xinhua News Agency in September 1958 after inspecting the north and south of the Yangtze River and returning to Beijing: "Up to now, some of our comrades are still unwilling to engage in large-scale mass movements in the industrial field. They describe the mass movements on the industrial front as 'irregular' and degrade them as 'rural style' and 'guerrilla habits.' This is obviously wrong."

Some people think that vigorously launching mass movements in industrial enterprises will disrupt various management systems and therefore be detrimental to production. This view, which opposes vigorously launching mass movements and strengthening enterprise management, is also wrong. In industrial enterprises, rules and regulations such as planning management, technical management, production management, and financial management are definitely needed. The higher the degree of modernization of the enterprise, the more it is necessary to strengthen management. The problem is how to manage and how to implement various management systems. There are two different approaches: one is to formulate rules and regulations behind closed doors by a few people, and to regard these rules and regulations as fixed and immutable, and the masses can only act within the scope stipulated by these systems; the other is to establish various management systems on the basis of vigorously launching mass movements, and to formulate, revise, enrich, and develop various rules and regulations through vigorously launching mass movements, and to implement various management systems. What we need is the latter management system. This is the management system of the proletariat leading industrial enterprises. Only such rules and regulations can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and give full play to the superiority of socialist enterprises. Management systems are to be implemented by the masses, and it is impossible to promote them well without mobilizing the masses.

The above are some views that we must clarify ideologically in vigorously launching mass movements, and also several problems that must be solved in order to plant the ideological roots of vigorously launching mass movements deeper.

III

The great progress made by the Second Ministry of Machine Building in production, capital construction, scientific research, and the political and ideological consciousness of the broad masses of workers and staff in the past year shows that our ideological roots for vigorously launching mass movements in industrial enterprises are deeper than in the past, and the trend is good. After the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, more and more people agree with vigorously launching mass movements, and fewer and fewer people oppose them. The broad masses of cadres are leading vigorously launching mass movements with full enthusiasm, and actively supporting and participating in mass movements. However, as far as the ideological status of the cadres of the Second Ministry of Machine Building is concerned, the depth of their ideological roots for vigorously launching mass movements in industrial enterprises is different, and there are different degrees of depth. Among them, some cadres truly understand vigorously launching mass movements, rely on the masses to lead production and work, can actually implement the Party's mass line at any time and in any work, and can take vigorously launching mass movements as the fundamental policy for implementing the Party's general line. There is also another part of cadres who, although actively support vigorously launching mass movements, have not yet raised it to the height of policy and line in their thinking. The roots are not deep enough, and the position is not stable enough, so they are not conscious enough about vigorously launching mass movements. Whether or not mass movements should be continuously and vigorously launched, they have not clearly resolved this issue, and therefore they are prone to some fluctuations. This part of the people is active in vigorously launching mass movements, and the number is relatively large. It is an important part of the force we rely on in industrial enterprises. Solving and improving the thinking of these people is of decisive significance for consolidating the ideological position of vigorously launching mass movements and further deepening vigorously launching mass movements. Our current task is to require these comrades to further improve their consciousness of vigorously launching mass movements, plant the ideological roots of vigorously launching mass movements deeper, and continue the great leap forward. As long as the ideological roots of vigorously launching mass movements are planted deeper, there is no doubt that the arguments against mass movements will be thoroughly refuted in theory and in fact, and the skeptics of mass movements will be powerfully criticized.

When I went to Xinjiang, I saw many poplar trees and elm trees along the way. Some comrades told me that although poplars grow fast and tall, their roots are not very deep. When a level seven or eight gale comes, some will fall. However, elm trees are different. Their roots are both deep and wide, and they do not fall when they encounter strong winds. Judging from the current development of mass movements in the Second Ministry of Machine Building, the overall situation is that the branches and leaves are flourishing, and the harvest is abundant. In terms of cadres' thinking, the ideological roots for mass movements are also deeper than in the past. In order to further develop mass movements and continue the great leap forward, we must deal with the issue of mass movements with both the flourishing branches and leaves and soaring enthusiasm like the poplar, and the depth and breadth like the roots of the elm tree. That is to say, we must combine the strengths of the poplar and the elm tree. In this way, even if we encounter the big cold wind blowing from the "old wind gap," we can always stand upright. In this way, we will be able to better and more firmly implement the Party's general line of socialist construction in our actual work.

    无产阶级领导工业的基本方针
    宋任穷
    毛泽东同志所提出并为全党和全国人民一致热烈拥护的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，以及破除迷信、解放思想、不断革命、大搞群众运动等极重要的指示，光辉地发展了马克思列宁主义，进一步发展了党的群众路线，奠定了以跃进的高速度建设社会主义的理论基础和思想基础。1958年，在全国农村实现的伟大的人民公社化，对加速我国的社会主义建设具有巨大的和深远的意义。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，一年多以来，群众运动正以万马奔腾之势，热火朝天地向前发展。
    一
    一年多以来，同全国的形势一样，第二机械工业部各个战线的群众运动，已经普遍地轰轰烈烈地展开。无论在生产方面、基本建设方面、科学研究工作方面和其他工作方面，群众运动的发展都是广泛的、深刻的、全面的。从直接参加生产和建设的职工到非生产人员，从各个车间、机、组到各职能部门，以至职工家属，都投入群众运动的洪流中。职工家属组织到生产运动中来，大搞农副业生产，不但改善了职工的生活，更重要的是提高了职工家属的社会主义思想觉悟。大约有90％以上的单位，群众运动的发展都是好的、健康的，有少数单位的群众运动发动得还不够充分。由于大搞群众运动，广大职工群众的革命干劲和建设社会主义的热情，异常饱满和高涨。这就使我们的生产、建设和其他工作，出现了继续大跃进的大好形势。生产逐月上升，计划被普遍地提前和超额完成。许多先进集体和先进个人，纷纷提前一个月或者两个月以上跨入了1960年。以二机部一个单位的生产来说，1959年在1958年大跃进的基础上（1958年相当于过去三年成绩总和的一倍半），提前五十天完成了年计划，超过1958年同期成绩的86％。基本建设战线的形势也好得很，成绩也很显著。科学研究工作和其他工作，都是欣欣向荣的局面。各项工作都出现了速度快、质量好、成本低、安全好的全面跃进形势。特别是自从党的八届八中全会以后，反右倾、鼓干劲，开展了深入的整风运动，群众运动的发展就来得更加迅速猛烈，既广泛又深刻，既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实，出现了枝叶并茂、丰产丰收的极好形势。所有这些，都是广大职工群众，在党的领导下，坚决贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的结果。
    在党委统一领导下大搞群众运动，不仅在生产和建设方面创造了优异成绩，而且广大职工群众的社会主义觉悟普遍地进一步提高，真是称得起生产建设和政治思想双丰收。现在走到职工群众中间，人人笑容满面，心情舒畅，他们的冲天干劲和首创精神，给人一种深刻的印象。这里举一个具体事例说明工人的社会主义觉悟程度：有一个生产单位的汽车队，过去每月只订七万吨公里的任务，还叫喊难于完成。1959年，他们的人员和汽车还是那样多，但是由于政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，“大战四月”，这个汽车队在一个月里就完成了十八万吨公里的任务。司机同志们不再像从前那样要超额奖了，他们所争夺的，是象征着荣誉的一面红旗。他们说：“三十块钱不如一面小红旗，车上有红旗，见了谁都光彩。”他们这种情感上和思想上的变化，具体地体现了社会主义思想觉悟的提高。像这样的事例，各单位是很多很多的。与此同时，我们各级领导干部也在群众运动中受到了锻炼。全体干部和工人群众一道，在大跃进中更加成长和提高。他们懂得大搞群众运动了，完成任务的信心更增强了，办法更多了。有一个单位，1959年10月份集中了各队长和党委书记进行整风学习，由一些科长在领导生产，而10月份的生产任务，同样完成得很好，群众运动同样轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实地向前发展。事实说明群众运动已成为群众自觉的行动。
    二
    在党的统一领导下，群众运动是枝叶并茂，同时它的根子也向深处发展。我们取得了丰富的经验，加深了认识，提高了自觉性。为了把大跃进持续地发展下去，必须在现有基础上，在全体干部中，把大搞群众运动的思想根子扎得更深，这是我们目前大搞群众运动深入一步的中心问题。
    工业战线上大搞群众运动是党的一贯方针。同在农业和其他战线一样，大搞群众运动是贯彻执行党的总路线的根本方法。就领导工业企业来说，大搞群众运动是带路线性质的根本问题。领导工业企业实际上存在着互相对立的两条路线：一条，党委领导，政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。通过大搞群众运动，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，搞好生产，搞好质量和安全；通过大搞群众运动开展技术革新和技术革命；通过大搞群众运动搞好工业企业管理，搞好职工生活。事实完全证明，这是一条行之有效的路线。在这里，实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动成为领导生产的核心问题。这样的路线，是无产阶级领导工业企业的路线。与这相对立的另一条路线，就是不要党的领导，不要群众运动，实行技术挂帅。依靠自上而下的行政命令办事，依靠“一劳永逸”的规章制度管理生产，慢慢腾腾，冷冷清清。当任务紧急时，如某一个修配车间所做的那样，出一张“明日苦战”的布告。在这里，自上而下的行政命令和管理成为进行一切工作的基础，不发动职工群众的主动性。这样一条路线实质上是资本主义旧制度旧思想残余在我们企业管理上的一种反映。从资产阶级观点看来，任何事情都只能依靠少数人，而不能依靠群众。十八世纪法国资产阶级革命时代的资产阶级哲学家卢梭说过：“最好的和最自然的办法，是以最聪明的少数人来管理大众。”由此可见，在工业企业中是否大搞群众运动，是一个带根本性质的方针路线问题，不是可有可无的简单的方法问题。
    党的总路线的基本精神，就是要动员最广大群众，来加速我国社会主义建设的进程。工业企业中大搞群众运动，正是党的总路线的贯彻和体现。没有大搞群众运动，党的总路线就要落空。大跃进必然是大搞群众运动的结果，没有大搞群众运动，也就不会有大跃进。政治挂帅，挂什么？怎么挂？如果不大搞群众运动，必然是无产阶级政治没有挂帅。在工业企业中所实行的党委领导下的厂长负责制，要求一切重大方针政策问题，必须经过党委讨论。但是重大问题并不是每天都在讨论，因此党委最中心、最经常的任务，就是大搞群众运动。如果抽去了大搞群众运动的内容，党委的领导必然无法体现无产阶级领导工业企业的方针路线，必然堕入所谓“以最聪明的少数人来管理大众”的资产阶级泥坑里去。由此不难看出，在工业企业中如何贯彻执行党的总路线，实行政治挂帅，如何实现党委领导下的厂长负责制，以及如何加强企业管理等问题的争论，其焦点都集中在搞或者是不搞群众运动问题上。
    我们之所以要坚定地大搞群众运动，把大搞群众运动看作是无产阶级领导工业企业的方针路线，是因为我们坚信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的。马克思列宁主义的经典作家和毛泽东同志一向教导我们，历史是人民群众创造的。人是生产力中最积极的因素。而我们党领导群众进行革命和建设的根本目的，就是要彻底地解放社会生产力，迅速地发展社会生产力。只有大搞群众运动，才能彻底打碎那些束缚广大劳动者的智慧和力量的枷锁，充分发挥广大群众的革命积极性，才能最大限度地促进生产力的迅速发展。历史事实证明：革命的深度和广度，决定于群众运动的深度和广度。我国社会主义建设的经验同样证明：大搞群众运动的深度和广度，决定着社会主义建设的速度。马克思说过：“最强大的一种生产力是革命阶级本身。”（“哲学的贫困”）毛泽东同志在“论联合政府”中指出：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“应该使每一个同志懂得，只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服。”大搞群众运动之为我们党的一贯的方针，正是基于对人民群众的这种马克思列宁主义观点，基于这种历史唯物主义的观点。我们所以坚持在工业企业中大搞群众运动，正是因为建设社会主义是千百万人民群众自己的事业。鼓足干劲是鼓足六亿五千万人民的干劲，力争上游是六亿五千万人民力争上游。只有依靠广大人民群众的自觉和自动，才能建成社会主义。人民群众的社会主义觉悟愈高，群众的积极性和创造性愈是发展，社会主义建设事业就愈是发展。列宁说得好，“生气勃勃的创造性的社会主义是由人民群众自己创立的”（“全俄中央执行委员会会议”）。刘少奇同志在“论党”中也写道：“我们共产党人的一切事业，都是人民群众的事业。……我们的一切，都依靠于、决定于人民群众的自觉与自动，不依靠于群众的自觉与自动，我们将一事无成，费力不讨好。”在工业企业中大搞群众运动，正是从这样的立场观点出发的。这也正是我们在一切工作中，大搞群众运动的思想基础和理论根据。
    我们党领导中国革命和建设的历史经验证明：在党的领导下，大搞群众运动这个思想，是毛泽东同志和他所代表的正确路线无往而不胜的保证。在民主革命时期，党就在农村中大搞群众运动，充分发动了群众，提高了广大群众的阶级觉悟和政治思想觉悟，建立、巩固和发展了农村革命根据地，彻底地消灭了封建地主阶级。在社会主义革命的时期，党又全面地开展了农业合作化运动，以及1958年的伟大的人民公社化运动。这都是亿万人民群众的革命运动，是民主革命和社会主义革命胜利的根本保证。又如，在军队工作上，确立在党委领导下大搞群众运动的方针，就建立了新型的官兵一致、军民一致的人民军队，改造了旧军队，并且依靠群众运动的力量，实现了部队内部的政治民主、军事民主和经济民主，使这支军队成为不可战胜的，“任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒”。（毛泽东：“论联合政府”）再如，在工业战线上，在1952年以前，大搞群众运动进行民主改革，比较彻底地打跨了工业企业内部的资本主义的旧制度，提高了广大职工群众的阶级觉悟和政治思想觉悟。特别是1958年，破除迷信、解放思想，大搞群众运动，实行中央工业和地方工业并举、大型企业和中小型企业并举、洋法生产和土法生产并举等一套两条腿走路的方针，全民投入建设社会主义热潮，工业战线上的面貌更加为之一新。事实生动地说明，彻底解放了的六亿五千万人民，登上了政治舞台，当家作主，迫切地要求迅速地改变“一穷二白”的状况，加速社会主义建设。这是强大无比的动力，我们必须看到这个伟大力量。毛泽东同志所代表的正确路线，正是集中地反映了广大群众的意愿，它为群众所掌握，就出现了轰轰烈烈的大跃进局面。
    大搞群众运动是否要不断地搞下去，这个观念有的人是不够明确的。在经过一定时期的群众运动以后，有的人说：“差不多了，尽这样下去，到哪一天为止呢？”他们怕紧张，不让群众运动不断地搞下去。我们认为这是“有限革命论”者。这种思想是由于没有正确地反映事物不断发展的客观规律，因而也就没有了解不断地大搞群众运动的意义。我们工人阶级是最彻底的革命阶级，我们虽然完成了民主革命，还要把社会主义革命进行到底，还要建设社会主义社会和共产主义社会。“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。”（毛泽东：“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）工人阶级的战斗口号应当是“不断革命”。在将来，人和人之间的关系的革命，人和自然界的关系的革命，都是永远不会停止的，只是不同于阶级社会里的革命罢了。
  “在社会主义社会和共产主义社会中，技术革新和社会制度革新的现象，都将是必然要继续发生的”（“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”）。我们既然是马克思列宁主义不断革命论者，既然要不断进行革命和建设，就自然要把大搞群众运动持续下去（当然，这并不是否认革命发展的阶段性）。由此可见，不断革命论也是我们不断地大搞群众运动的思想基础和理论根据。
    是大搞群众运动好，还是中搞、小搞群众运动好？我们的答复是大搞群众运动好。但是，在一部分干部中间，有的主张小搞、中搞，不赞成大搞。一方面，他们要革命，但怕出乱子，怕有缺点，不敢放手发动群众，群众起来之后，产生无穷的忧虑，甚至限制群众运动。这种观点是错误的。既要革命和建设，就要大搞群众运动，就不能怕产生缺点。革命的群众运动，不是绣花，产生一些暂时的缺点是难免的。我们所取得的成绩和工作中所产生的缺点的关系，只是九个指头和一个指头的关系，或是缺点还占不到一个指头。退一步讲，即使缺点占两个、三个指头，也不能因此否定成绩。那种要求革命的群众运动四平八稳，不产生任何缺点的想法，是天真的、幼稚的。我们马克思主义者最重要的是要看到群众运动中最主要最本质的成就，要看到新生和刚露头的东西，并且加以抚育、提倡和推广。自然，新生的东西，开始总是不那样完满，需要在群众运动中不断加以充实，这是我们领导群众运动的责任。
    有人认为，现代工业的机械化自动化程度很高，瞬息万变，需要高度的集中统一，因而不能大搞群众运动。这种观点是错误的。现代工业企业的机械化自动化的程度很高，需要高度的集中统一，这是事实，但这决不排除大搞群众运动。正是要在大搞群众运动的基础上，统一思想，统一行动，才会更加有利于集中统一。军队打仗是最需要集中统一的，军队可以大搞群众运动，难道工矿企业就不能吗？有人批评我们说，现在工业企业中大搞群众运动，是恢复1952年以前领导工业企业极落后的制度，是农村作风、游击习气。这种批评是不正确的。在1952年以前，确实是工矿企业民主改革大搞群众运动的阶段，这不是什么落后的东西，而是群众路线的光荣传统。毛泽东同志在1958年9月间，在巡视大江南北回北京后，对新华社记者发表的重要谈话中指出：“到现在，我们还有一些同志不愿意在工业方面搞大规模的群众运动，他们把在工业战线上搞群众运动，说成是‘不正规’，贬之为‘农村作风’、‘游击习气’。这显然是不对的。”
    有人认为，在工业企业中大搞群众运动，会打乱各种管理制度，因而对生产不利。这种把大搞群众运动同加强企业管理相对立的观点，也是错误的。在工业企业中，计划管理、技术管理、生产管理和财务管理等等规章制度，肯定是需要的。企业的现代化程度越高，越是需要加强管理。问题在于，如何进行管理和如何贯彻执行各种管理制度。有两种不同的做法：一种，是由少数人闭门造车地来制定规章制度，并且把这种规章制度看成固定不变，群众只能在这种制度所规定的范围内办事；另一种，把各种管理制度建立在大搞群众运动的基础之上，通过大搞群众运动来制定、修改、充实和发展各种规章制度，来贯彻执行各种规章制度。我们所需要的，是后一种管理制度。这是无产阶级领导工业企业的管理制度。只有这样的规章制度，才能充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，充分发挥社会主义企业的优越性。管理制度是要群众来实施的，不在发动群众的基础上，是不可能推行得好的。
    以上是我们大搞群众运动必须从思想上弄清楚的一些观点，也是为了把大搞群众运动的思想根子扎得更深必须解决的几个问题。
    三
    第二机械工业部一年多来大搞群众运动，从而在生产方面、基本建设方面、科学研究工作方面以及广大职工群众的政治思想觉悟方面所获得的巨大进步，说明我们对于在工业企业中必须大搞群众运动的思想根子比过去扎得更深了，趋势是好的。经过整风和反右倾斗争，赞成大搞群众运动的人越来越多了，反对的人越来越少了。广大干部是满腔热情地在领导大搞群众运动，积极拥护和参加群众运动。但是，就二机部干部的思想状况来讲，对于在工业企业中大搞群众运动的思想根子，其深度是不同的，是有浅有深的。其中有的干部真正懂得大搞群众运动，依靠群众来领导生产和工作，在任何时候和任何工作中都能够实际地贯彻执行党的群众路线，能够把大搞群众运动作为贯彻执行党的总路线的根本方针。还有另外一部分干部，他们虽然积极拥护大搞群众运动，但是在思想上还没有提到方针路线的高度来认识，根子扎得还不够深，阵地站得还不够稳，因而对大搞群众运动还不够自觉。群众运动是否要不断地大搞下去，他们对这个问题是没有明确地解决的，因而也就容易发生一些摇摆。这一部分人对大搞群众运动是积极的，而且人数比较多，是我们在工业企业中依靠力量的一个重要部分。解决和提高这部分人的思想，对巩固大搞群众运动的思想阵地，进一步深入大搞群众运动，都是有决定意义的。我们当前的任务，就是要求这些同志，更加提高大搞群众运动的自觉性，把大搞群众运动的思想根子扎得更深，把大跃进持续下去。只要把大搞群众运动的思想根子扎得更深，毫无疑问，就会在理论上和事实上彻底驳倒反对群众运动的言论，有力地批判群众运动的怀疑论者。
    我到新疆，一路上看见许多白杨树和榆树。有的同志告诉我，白杨虽然长得快，长得高，但是它的根却不很深，七、八级大风一来，有些就要倾倒；而榆树则不同，它的根扎得既深又广，遇到大风而不倒。根据二机部目前群众运动发展的状况来看，总的是枝叶并茂、丰产丰收，干部思想上，对群众运动的思想根子，也比过去扎深了。为了进一步发展群众运动，把大跃进持续地发展下去，我们对待群众运动的问题，要既像钻天杨一样的枝叶并茂和干劲冲天，又像榆树根一样的深广，就是说，要把白杨和榆树的长处结合起来。这样，即使遇到从“老风口”吹来的大冷风，也能够永远直立。这样，我们就能够更好地和更加坚定地在实际工作中贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线。
