　　The Motherland is Full of Voices of "Mother"
　　The Motherland is Full of Voices of "Mother"
　　During the festival, my longing for relatives is doubled,
　　Separated from home for so long, my longing arises;
　　A single line in a family letter is worth a thousand gold,
　　The motherland is full of voices of "Mother".
　　Facing the cold wind on high mountains by the sea,
　　The border soldiers are warm and happy;
　　Eagerly reading the warm letters from their mothers,
　　Leaning on their rifles, busily writing back and forth.
　　You say a word, and I add a sentence,
　　Delighting and worrying the writer;
　　Words full of emotion and heartfelt thoughts,
　　Deep affection and rich meaning, the pen feels clumsy…
　　In winter, one longs for the sun, in summer, one longs for the wind,
　　Beautiful scenery, one longs for the benefactor;
　　Mother sends a letter from afar, praising her son,
　　But it is the beloved Party that should be praised.
　　It taught us love and hate,
　　Forged our steel arms and iron bodies;
　　When I left you, I was still an ignorant child,
　　Now I am skilled in both military and literary arts.
　　The commune's scenery will last ten thousand years,
　　We are the gatekeepers of the commune,
　　The Communist Party is the sun,
　　We are the sun's guardians;
　　Protecting the Party and Chairman Mao,
　　Protecting the motherland's construction, soaring day by day;
　　Grasping the big gun tightly, brows furrowed in anger,
　　Always vigilant against invaders!
　　Motherly love warms the soldiers' hearts,
　　Soldiers and people, flesh and blood;
　　Once the letter is written, no need to worry where to send it,
　　The Party newspaper is the messenger.
　　　　　　　　　　Border Guard, Yin Heyun

    祖国到处有娘声
    祖国到处有娘声
    时逢佳节倍思亲，
    别家久远怀念生；
    家书片言千金贵，
    祖国到处有娘声。
    高山临海迎寒风，
    边防战士暖融融；
    争读娘亲温暖的信，
    依枪修书闹纷纷。
    你一言呵我一句，
    喜煞急坏执笔人；
    言含情呵话是心，
    情深意浓笔太笨……
    冬恋太阳夏恋风，
    光景美丽恋恩人；
    娘遥寄书夸儿郎，
    应该夸的是亲爱的党。
    她教会咱爱和恨，
    铸就咱钢臂铁身；
    离你时还是不懂事的娃娃，
    如今已精武又会文。
    公社光景万年春，
    咱是公社看门人，
    共产党呵是太阳，
    咱是太阳守卫神；
    保卫党和毛主席，
    保卫祖国建设日日飞腾；
    大枪握紧怒横眉，
    随时警惕侵犯者！
    母爱温暖了战士心，
    战士、人民骨肉情；
    书成何愁无投处，
    党报就是传信人。
            边防战士　尹和云
