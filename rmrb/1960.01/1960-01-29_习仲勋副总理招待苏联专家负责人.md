Xinhua News Agency, January 28th: Vice Premier of the State Council, Xi Zhongxun, hosted a banquet tonight to entertain the Soviet expert representatives who are helping our country with its construction, warmly celebrating our country's traditional festival - the Spring Festival.

　　At tonight's banquet, the hosts and guests were filled with joy, gathering together like family, frequently raising their glasses to wish the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples would last forever, and to wish the solidarity and further prosperity and strength of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union.

　　Soviet Ambassador to China, Chervonenko, and other responsible personnel from the embassy were invited to attend the banquet.

　　At the banquet, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, on behalf of the State Council, extended festive greetings and cordial regards to Ambassador Chervonenko, the head of the Soviet experts Fu Ming, and all the Soviet comrades present, as well as their wives and children.

　　Xi Zhongxun said that this year's Spring Festival is being celebrated by the Chinese people in an exceptionally joyful mood. The international and domestic situations are both very good for us. In our two great countries, we are pleased to see that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, have achieved ever-greater victories for the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. We have exceeded the 1959 National Economic Development Plan and achieved the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. We are also pleased to see that the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Khrushchev, have achieved brilliant results in the first year of implementing the magnificent Seven-Year Plan. I would like to take this opportunity to celebrate the Spring Festival and congratulate the Chinese people on the great victories they have achieved in socialist construction; congratulate the Soviet people on the great victories they have achieved in communist construction; and congratulate the unbreakable friendly alliance and mutual assistance and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, which will forever radiate brilliant light to all mankind along the path of victorious development over the past decade!

　　Xi Zhongxun said, here, it should also be emphatically pointed out that the rapid development of China's socialist construction is inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country, and it is also inseparable from the selfless labor of all Soviet experts working in our country. This fully embodies the profound friendship of the Soviet people. The Chinese people deeply cherish this great friendship of the Soviet people and will continue to make unremitting efforts to learn from the advanced experience and advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union.

　　Ambassador Chervonenko spoke at the banquet. He also expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese government and people for their meticulous care for the Soviet experts. Chervonenko said that Soviet experts have not only helped China with its construction, but have also learned a lot of experience. The richer the experience of our two countries, the stronger the two countries will become, and the more the unity and friendship between the two countries will be strengthened and developed, and the more the forces of imperialism will be weakened. Finally, he wished the Chinese people greater achievements in the future and create a better life.

　　Fu Ming, the head of the Soviet experts, said at the banquet that the great festival of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is coming soon, and this treaty has great significance. In these ten years, the Soviet and Chinese peoples have worked together to greatly promote and develop the economic construction of China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet experts in China believe that it is their duty to vigorously help China's economic construction, and the Soviet people cherish the friendship with the Chinese people very much. He proposed a toast to the development of the eternal friendship between the two peoples.

　　Also present at the banquet were responsible persons from various departments of the State Council and responsible persons from Beijing.

    习仲勋副总理招待苏联专家负责人
    新华社28日讯　国务院副总理习仲勋今晚举行宴会，招待帮助我国建设的苏联专家负责人，热烈地欢庆我国传统节日——春节。
    在今晚的宴会上，宾主喜气洋洋，像家人一样欢聚一堂，频频举杯祝中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊万古长青，祝以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的团结和进一步繁荣富强。
    苏联驻华大使契尔沃年科及大使馆的其他负责人员应邀出席了宴会。
    习仲勋副总理在宴会上，代表国务院向契尔沃年科大使、苏联专家负责人符明及在座的全体苏联同志和他们的夫人、孩子们，致以节日的祝贺和亲切的慰问。
    习仲勋说，今年的春节，我国人民是在异常欢乐的心情中度过的。国外和国内的形势，对我们来说，都是好得很。在我们两个伟大的国家里，我们高兴地看到，中国人民在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，已经取得了对总路线、大跃进和人民公社越来越大的胜利，已经超额完成了1959年发展国民经济计划，并且提前三年实现了第二个五年计划的主要指标。我们也高兴地看到，苏联人民在苏联共产党中央和赫鲁晓夫同志的领导下，在执行宏伟的七年计划的第一年中，已经取得了辉煌的成绩。我愿意借这个欢度春节的机会，祝贺我国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大胜利；祝贺苏联人民在共产主义建设中所取得的伟大胜利；并且祝贺中苏两国人民之间的牢不可破的友好同盟和互助合作将要沿着过去十年来胜利发展的道路，永远地向全人类放射着灿烂的光辉！
    习仲勋说，在这里，还应当着重地指出，我国社会主义建设事业飞跃发展，是同苏联对我国的无私援助分不开的，也是同在我国工作的全体苏联专家的忘我劳动分不开的。这充分体现了苏联人民的深情厚谊。中国人民十分珍视苏联人民这种伟大的情谊，今后仍将努力不懈地向苏联的先进经验和先进科学技术学习。
    契尔沃年科大使在宴会上讲了话。也表示衷心感谢中国政府和人民对苏联专家无微不至的关怀。契尔沃年科说，苏联专家不仅帮助了中国建设，而且也学到了很多经验。我们两国的经验越丰富，两国就会越加强大，两国的团结和友谊不断加强和发展，帝国主义的势力就会更加削弱。最后他预祝中国人民今后取得更大的成就，创造更加美好的生活。
    苏联专家负责人符明在宴会上讲话说，中苏友好同盟互助条约签订十周年的伟大节日就要到了，这个条约有着巨大的意义。在这十年中，苏联和中国人民共同努力把中苏两国的经济建设大大推进和发展了。苏联在中国的专家认为，大力帮助中国经济建设是自己的职责，苏联人民非常珍视同中国人民的友谊。他建议为发展两国人民永恒的友谊而干杯。
    出席宴会的还有国务院所属各部门负责人和北京市的负责人。
