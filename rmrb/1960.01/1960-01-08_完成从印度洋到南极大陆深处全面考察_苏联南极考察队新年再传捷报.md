    Completing Comprehensive Survey from Indian Ocean to Deep Interior of Antarctic Continent
    Further Good News from Soviet Antarctic Expedition in the New Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th - TASS reports: Shortly after reaching the South Geographic Pole, the Soviet Antarctic Expedition reported further good news. Another expedition team consisting of seven members, braving severe blizzards for one hundred and ninety-one days, successfully completed a difficult scientific expedition of eight hundred and seventy kilometers.
    On January 5th, a scientific expedition team led by geophysicist Sheglov arrived at the "Komsomolskaya" station with new achievements from their expedition. During their arduous journey of eight hundred and seventy kilometers, they accurately measured the height of icebergs in the central part of the Antarctic continent for the first time.
    The entire work of this small expedition team was divided into two stages. The first stage was completed during the Antarctic summer of last year. The expedition work was temporarily suspended during the Antarctic night period, and resumed in September of last year. The expedition work was often hampered by blizzards. A considerable part of the journey was traversed at an altitude of three thousand meters, where oxygen was extremely scarce and the severe cold reached minus fifty degrees Celsius. During the journey, aircraft from the Soviet Antarctic aviation team repeatedly delivered food and fuel to the expedition team.
    Their expedition completed the first comprehensive, systematic, and precise geodetic and gravity survey of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geophysics, from the coast of the Indian Ocean to the depths of the Antarctic continent. Based on the materials obtained from this expedition and previous expeditions, it will be possible to draw a meridian cross-section map from the coast of the Indian Ocean to the interior of Antarctica. Of particular value is that these materials can help determine the altitude of the terrain, both on and under the ice, in eastern Antarctica.

    完成从印度洋到南极大陆深处全面考察
    苏联南极考察队新年再传捷报
    新华社莫斯科6日电　据塔斯社报道：苏联南极考察队在到达南地理极后不久，又传来了捷报。另一支由七人组成的考察队在大风雪中奋战一百九十一天，顺利完成了长达八百七十公里的、艰巨的科学考察。
    1月5日，由地球物理学家谢格洛夫率领的一支科学考察队满载着考察的新成果到达了“共青团”站。他们在总长达八百七十公里的艰难行程中，第一次准确地测定了南极大陆中部的冰山高度。
    这支人数不多的考察队的全部工作共分两个阶段。第一阶段是在去年南极夏季完成的。在南极夜时期暂时中止过考察工作，去年9月又恢复考察。考察工作常常受到暴风雪的阻碍。相当长的一段路程，他们是在海拔达三千米的高地上通过的，那些地方氧气极度缺乏，严寒竟达摄氏零下五十度。在行进途中，苏联南极飞行队的飞机多次地给考察队运送了粮食和燃料。
    他们的这次考察完成了苏联科学院地球物理研究所的研究人员第一次对从印度洋海岸直到南极大陆深处进行全面、系统而精确的大地测量和重力考察。根据这次考察和过去历次考察获得的材料，将可以绘制出从印度洋海岸到南极腹地的子午线断面图。特别有价值的是，这些材料可帮助确定南极东部冰上和冰下的地势高度。
