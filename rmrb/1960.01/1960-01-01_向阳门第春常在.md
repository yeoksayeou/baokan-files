A new decade, the 1960s, has begun!

Our motherland, in the 1950s, entered the spring of human history. Across the land of China, the sun shines, the spring breeze caresses, vitality flourishes, and the scenery is magnificent. It is precisely, "Only when one is intimately familiar with the east wind, can one recognize that all the myriad colors are spring." Today, as we stand at the beginning of a new era, we look ahead, and before us lies boundless brightness, and the future is filled with hope and victory.

Throughout the 1950s, our country's revolution and construction cause has been advancing victoriously. The great achievements of ten years are dazzling, and the pace of progress of ten years has been vigorous. In 1958, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people found three magic weapons: the general line for building socialism, the great leap forward development speed, and the people's commune organizational form. We held these three magic weapons and advanced courageously, achieving brilliant victories. 1959 has passed. How did we live this year? Year-end accounts show that the three magic weapons are shining brightly. 1959 was another year of continuing the Great Leap Forward, another year of continuing great victories. Compared to 1958, more steel flowed from our steel furnaces, more coal was mined from the mines, more grain and cotton were harvested from the land, and the people's lives were further improved. What people gained in their thinking was even more, and more. We armed ourselves with the spirit of the general line, armed ourselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and from practice, we saw the goal of advancement more clearly and recognized the path to victory. We went full steam ahead, sang aloud, and stepped into the spring-filled 1960s with full confidence.

"The sun shines brightly on every household," the various construction endeavors in our country are like a hundred flowers blooming in spring, and myriad trees growing, full of vitality and vibrant spring. New victories are sprouting from our country's fertile land like bamboo shoots after rain. On the industrial front, millions of workers are holding high the red banner of continuous revolution and advancing victoriously. Before the new year, they were already "accumulating grass and storing grain," and "sharpening knives and polishing guns," determined to achieve a red opening, monthly red, and a year-round red this year. In the rural areas across the country, the pig raising and fertilizer accumulation movement is in full swing. People want to welcome the "black god of wealth" into their homes to add nutrients for even greater harvests next year. The water conservancy construction sites are even more ablaze. People are opening mountains and splitting ridges, building dams across rivers, and adding moisture for next year's harvest. However, even more nutrients and moisture are in people's minds. Under the banner of the Party's general line, hundreds of millions of heroic people have become increasingly motivated and confident, and their pace of advancement is getting faster and faster. People have great ambitions and a majestic spirit, not only acting but also thinking, not only having courage but also strategy, using infinite wisdom, and doing everything possible to advance towards victory at high speed. "The spring scenery cannot be confined," from the first day of the 1960s, we saw new victories.

In our country, it is always spring, and in our minds, it is also always spring. There is a Spring Festival couplet in our country: "A sunny home always has spring." Yes, our country is a "sunny home," always full of brilliant sunshine. This sunshine is none other than the invincible Marxism-Leninism, the great, correct, and glorious Communist Party of China. Under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people have held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and advanced from victory to victory. With the Party and the truth of Marxism-Leninism, we will always be a "sunny home," always living in a bright spring.

Our country is a "sunny home," and the entire socialist camp is a "sunny home." The chimes of the 1960s have already rung. Under the pervasive sunshine, the "sunny home" will surely bloom with myriad purples and reds, and dazzling flowers.

    向阳门第春常在
    柳笛
    二十世纪六十年代开始了！
    我们的祖国在五十年代里，走入了人类历史上的春天。神州大地上，阳光普照、春风拂面，生机蓬勃，景色灿烂。正是“等闲识得东风面，万紫千红总是春”。今天，我们站在一个新的年代的开端，举目高瞻，眼前是无限光明，前途充满着希望和胜利。
    整个五十年代，我们国家的革命和建设事业一直走着胜利的路程，十年的伟大成就光芒万丈，十年的前进步伐气冲牛斗。1958年，我国人民在党和毛主席的领导下找到了三个法宝：建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式。我们手持三件法宝，奋勇前进，取得了辉煌的胜利。1959年过去了，这一年，我们的日子过得怎么样呢？年终结账：三个法宝闪闪发光，金碧辉煌，1959年，又是继续大跃进的一年，继续大胜利的一年。比起1958年来，我们的炼钢炉里流出了更多的钢水，矿井里挖出了更多的煤炭，从土地上收获到更多的粮食和棉花，人民的生活也进一步提高，而人们思想里收获到的却是更多、更多。我们用总路线的精神武装了自己，用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想武装了自己，从实践中更加明确地看清了前进的目标，认清了通向胜利的道路。我们开足马力、高歌猛进，满怀信心地走进满目春光的六十年代。
    “千门万户曈曈日”，我们国家里的各项建设事业，犹如春天里的百花齐放，万木丛生，充满了生机，充满了盎然春意。新的胜利正像雨后春笋般地从我们国家肥沃的土地上生长出来了。工业战线上千百万职工正在高举不断革命的红旗乘胜前进，他们在年前就“积草囤粮”、“磨刀擦枪”，决心在今年实现开门红、月月红、全年红。全国农村里的养猪积肥运动热火朝天，人们要把“黑财神”接上门来，为明年更大的丰收增添养料。水利工地上更是一团火红，人们开山劈岭，拦河筑坝，为明年的丰收增添水分。然而，更多的养料和水分，还在人们的思想里。亿万英雄人民在党的总路线的旗帜下，革命干劲愈鼓愈足，胜利的信心越来越大，前进的步子也愈来愈快。人们胸怀大志，气吞长虹，不仅动手，而且动脑，不仅有勇，而且有谋，运用无穷的智慧，千方百计地向着胜利高速度挺进。“满园春色关不住”，我们从六十年代的第一天，就看见了新的胜利。
    我们的国家里，永远是春天，我们的思想里，也永远是春天。我国有一句春联是：“向阳门第春常在”。是的，我们的国家是一个“向阳门第”，永远充满了灿烂的阳光。这阳光，不是别的，正是战无不胜的马克思列宁主义，是伟大、正确、光荣的中国共产党。我国人民就是在党的领导下，高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，从胜利走向胜利的。有了党，有了马克思列宁主义的真理，我们就永远是个“向阳门第”，永远生活在明媚的春天。
    我们的国家是“向阳门第”，整个社会主义阵营都是“向阳门第”。六十年代的钟声已经响了，“向阳门第”在阳光普照之下，一定会开放出万紫千红、灿烂夺目的花朵。
