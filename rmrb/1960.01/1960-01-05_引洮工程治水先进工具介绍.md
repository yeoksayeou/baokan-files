Editor's Note: The Yintai (River) Project is a banner of high efficiency in water conservancy construction in Gansu Province. Under the leadership of the Party Committee of the Engineering Bureau, the thousands of workers participating in this project vigorously engaged in technical innovation, creating and improving 330,000 tools in one year. Tool reform was achieved in all work processes, and the average daily work efficiency increased to 18.1 cubic meters.
The various simple machines created by the workers in the Yintai Project generally have the advantages of easy manufacture, low cost, and high work efficiency. Now, we have selected some simple tool diagrams and advanced construction methods for digging, loading, transporting, filling, and ramming processes for reference by various construction sites.
Digging
Earthwork Blasting
I. Select the blasting location: On the principle of not damaging the canal embankment, the blasting site is best chosen at the foot of the mountain with three to four free faces. If there is no such natural terrain, adopt the method of combining large cannons with small cannons and small cannons with manual excavation to create such terrain.
II. Drilling blasting holes: There are four types of blasting holes: vertical, inclined, curved, and horizontal. In each type of blasting hole, a broken line of one to two meters should be drilled, and the bottom where the charge is loaded should be shaped like a gourd, so that the blasting power is greater and labor and medicine are saved. The four types of blasting holes have their own characteristics. Horizontal holes are easy to excavate, but it is not easy to tamp the seal after loading the charge, and the fire often sprays out from the hole, causing waste. Other three types of blasting holes are generally dug to a depth of about ten meters, and the diameter of the hole is six to one decimeter, which is labor-intensive to excavate, but it is easy to tamp the seal, and the fire is not easy to spray out. Gourd-shaped holes are dug to a depth of about three meters, and the diameter of the hole is left at two decimeters, and the blasting power is greater.
The main tool for drilling holes is the steel drill. For drilling medium-sized gourd blasting holes, the longer the steel drill, the better; for drilling large blasting holes, the steel drill can be shorter, generally half a meter long. According to the characteristics of red clay, the use of nail-shaped or cylindrical steel drills has higher work efficiency. To take the loose soil from the medium-sized gourd blasting hole, the use of digging spoons and scrapers is the most convenient.
III. Proportion of explosive mixture and charging method: Mix six substances such as salt, sulfur, coal powder, coal slag, sawdust, and gravel in black powder. The mixing ratio is: salt accounts for 40% of the explosive, sulfur accounts for 5%, sawdust accounts for 60%, gravel accounts for 300%, and coal powder and coal slag account for one time. The explosive and the six substances are not mixed.
When charging, first use pebbles, wood chips, and fine coal to line the bottom of the blasting hole in layers, then put the wrapped explosive on these sundries, and finally use pebbles, wood chips, coal, etc. to surround the explosive package (as shown in the left figure), which can better exert the blasting power. The packaging method of the explosive is: wrap salt and sulfur in layers or mix them around the explosive, and wrap them with wooden boxes or cardboard boxes, kraft paper, or newspapers, and finally tie them tightly with hemp rope. The fuse or electric blister and detonator are wrapped in at the same time (as shown in the right figure).
IV. Winding the fuse, releasing the fuse, and electrical blasting operation methods: 1. If there is little moisture in the blasting hole and it is relatively dry, dig a small groove one centimeter wide at the bottom of the blasting hole, put the wound fuse in the groove, cover it with a small stone slab, and then fill the hole in layers for detonation.
2. If there is a lot of moisture in the blasting hole and it is relatively wet, clamp the wound fuse in a wooden stick that is chiseled through the middle and fasten the wooden stick before putting it into the blasting hole. The method is to split the wooden stick into two halves, chisel a small groove in the middle, roll the fuse into a thickness of five to eight millimeters, and put it in the groove, then close the wooden stick.
3. Electric blasting of black powder uses electric blisters, batteries, and leather or lead wires for detonation (as shown in the upper left figure). When electrically blasting yellow explosives, use batteries in series with leather wires to detonate the detonator (as shown in the lower left figure). Lead wire electric blasting is mainly used on the construction site now.
V. Do a good job of sealing: This work is very important. If the seal is not good, the gunpowder will spray out from the blasting hole after ignition, which will not only have no blasting effect, but also cause accidents and losses. To seal the mouth well, the soil quality of the sealing soil should be good, and the soil should contain 25% water; and use iron and stone rods to tamp it in layers, each layer is two decimeters thick, and the surrounding area must be tamped; second, to prevent fire leakage, so as not to reduce the blasting power.
Digging tools
I. Multi-tooth hoe: It can be divided into two-tooth, three-tooth, and four-tooth types, weighing about two or three kilograms, and is suitable for digging in loess, red clay, and light gravel areas. Among them, the three-tooth hoe is the most economical and practical, and its work efficiency is more than three times higher than that of ordinary foreign hoes. One person can dig 120 to 150 cubic meters of loess a day.
II. Soil-prying lever: Suitable for ordinary soil and red clay areas, operated by two people. Use three iron bars, two eight-pound heavy hammers, and one hardwood lever. First dig a platform on the working surface with a height difference of about 1.2 meters, then drive the three iron bars into the soil in a row. The iron bars are about 0.8 meters away from the edge, and the distance between the iron bars is about 0.6 meters, then use the wooden lever to pry and push the iron bars, so that about one cubic meter of ordinary soil can be pried loose each time, which takes an average of two minutes, and two people can dig 260 cubic meters of ordinary soil a day.
III. Universal digging tool: Except for the blade, the rest of this digging tool is made of wood (as shown in the right figure). When using, first dig a ditch of 0.5 meters × 0.57 meters, one person holds the handle, and one person pulls it in front. Pull and press in unison. The thickness of the soil cut should be 5 cm to 6 cm, and the depth of soil turning is generally 37 cm to 40 cm. It can be up to 50 cm on slopes, and can be used in conjunction with the layer-by-layer peeling method to dig loess.
Loading
Single-person jack crane
This tool is suitable for large-scale lifting and installation projects. It is made according to the principle of levers and axles. When operating, one person pulls down the operating lever to rotate the rope to drive the large wheel, and the large wheel drives the lifting rod to lift things. The lifting height is 25 to 30 meters, and the efficiency is relatively high. It can replace 20 people to operate, and it takes 5 minutes to lift once. Its structure is as follows:
Live-head soil chute
This automatic soil loading method is widely used. As long as there is a straight wall of more than one meter, with a slope above, and soil can be taken, it can be used. The method is to dig a small channel with a large top and a small bottom on the slope. The slope is generally 50 degrees to 70 degrees, based on the principle that the soil automatically slides down. In order to prevent the soil from sliding out of the carriage, a retaining plate needs to be added to the chute opening. The retaining plate can be divided into upper flap, lower flap, and long-mouth trough (as shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3). When installing, nail the live plate to the cliff wall on both sides of the chute opening with long nails (if it is difficult to install the loess, you can first nail large wooden stakes into the soil, and then nail the live plate swivel to the top of the stake). The small pulley is installed in a place slightly higher than the live head plate, and then the pull rope is passed through the small pulley, and a small hole is drilled in the kiln roof with a steel drill to tie it to the wooden stake below. If the small pulley jumps out of the wheel, it can be made into the shape of Figure 4. Using this method can increase the work efficiency by one time compared with manual transportation and milling.
Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 4
Transport
Soil-sliding river
The soil-sliding river is most suitable for digging and transporting projects with high-splitting and inclined transportation of soil and sand. Placed on a slope of 7 to 8 degrees, using the pressure of the soil's weight, or rocking by one or two people, the river channel slides on the camel wheel to transport the soil and sand from the excavation site to the outside, as fast as the speed of the river water. On a transport distance of 30 meters, the work efficiency of each person per day is at least 48 cubic meters or more.
The entire structure of the soil-sliding river is divided into river channel, camel wheel, floating wheel, floating wheel track, support, prism gear, throwing wheel and other parts, all made of wood. River channel: It is made of boards that are 0.63 meters long, 0.16 meters wide, and 2 to 3 centimeters thick. The channel wall plates of 0.15 meters high are nailed to the two ends of each board at a distance of 1 centimeter inward. The entire board is connected by chain hooks. The length of the chain hooks must be consistent with the width of the wooden board, otherwise it cannot rotate. Camel wheel: It is made of a 2.5-decimeter round plate, sleeved on a wooden stick of 8.9 centimeters large and 0.67 meters long. The two ends of the wooden stick are inlaid with iron shafts with a diameter of 2 decimeters, and are installed on the floating wheel track with ball bearings. Floating wheel: It is made of a 5-decimeter-diameter round plate, sleeved on a 1-decimeter-large, 7-decimeter-long wooden stick. The combination should be correct, and the size should be able to pass through the river channel wall panel. Floating wheel track: It is specially used to support the weight of the camel wheel carrying the river channel. Prism gear and throwing wheel are used as power to drive the river channel. The distance of the prism teeth is the same as the width of the river channel board, so that it plays the role of a gear. The soil-sliding channel should be installed at a slope of 1 to 0.5. It is best to use the soil-sliding river in places where the earthwork is large and difficult to move. The line should be straight and stable.
Profile view high-line soil transportation with chain hooks
The first type: First, bury two large wooden stakes at the bottom of the soil dumping platform; bury a wooden stake and a set of tight rope winches at the upper soil loading platform, and then tighten the 8mm round iron rope or three strands of No. 10 or No. 8 lead wire rope on the upper and lower wooden stakes. Pass the iron rope through the pulley hook, and hang a willow basket or soil loading box below. During operation, the heavy one goes down and the light one goes up, so that the willow basket or soil loading box continuously transports the soil from the canal. It is suitable for steep slopes, operated by two or three people, and its work efficiency is six times higher than manual carrying. At a transportation distance of 100 meters, each frame can transport 60 cubic meters of soil per day.
The second type: The method is basically the same as above. Four wooden stakes are buried up and down, the tightener is moved below, the soil loading platform is higher, and the soil loading capacity is increased. The work efficiency is increased by 50% compared with the previous one. Operated by two or three people, at a transportation distance of 100 meters, each frame can transport 90 cubic meters of soil per day.
Flat-line soil transportation
The first type: The wooden stake burying method and tight rope installation are the same as high-line soil transportation. There are a total of four lead wire ropes. Each rope is sleeved with front and rear two pulleys. The soil loading box is longer, and each box has a soil capacity of 0.08 cubic meters. It is used for flat slopes within one twenty-fifth, operated by three or four people. At a transportation distance of 100 meters, each frame can transport 70 cubic meters of soil per day.
The second type: Still use two lead wire ropes or 8mm round iron, and the installation method is the same as before. Six or seven strip baskets are hung on each lead wire rope in a row, with one pulley per basket, and no towing rope is required. At the upper stake location, use a soil loading platform to continuously load soil. One person pushes it out vigorously at a time, one basket at a time, and the soil baskets slide continuously to dump the soil. After one row of soil baskets is sent, another row of empty soil baskets is pulled back by people to load soil as before, and the work is cycled. The slope of the lead wire rope can be slowed down to one-thirtieth, operated by six people. At a transportation distance of 100 meters, each frame can transport 60 cubic meters of soil per day.
Double-pulley soil transporter
It consists of a bracket and two vertical wheels. The bracket is divided into two layers. The lower layer is filed with wooden nests and wrapped with iron sheets and nails. The upper layer is filed with a pair of round holes (the thickness of the nests and holes can be determined according to the diameter of the vertical wheels), and a pair of pulleys are installed on each side. There is a pair of vertical wheels in total, divided into three parts: vertical shaft, vertical wheel, and flat wheel. The flat wheel is cross-shaped, divided into upper and lower layers. During operation, pass two four-head pull ropes through the pulleys and vertical wheels, and tie them to four soil transporting vehicles. Four people push back and forth, and two people pull up and down. With this tool, taking soil from a canal as deep as 10 meters, the average work efficiency per person per day can reach 17 to 22 cubic meters.
Water train
This is a good tool for winter construction, suitable for excavation projects above the platform of clay canals. Because it uses a glider to slide on the slide, the operation is labor-saving, the speed is very fast, and it can achieve more loading and faster running on gentle slopes. When the water freezes in winter, it is more conducive to sliding. The entire structure is composed of a glider, floating wheel, carriage, rear wheel, etc. It should be used in conjunction with automatic soil loading equipment (soil-sliding chute, soil loading kiln, etc.). When the transportation distance is 60 meters, each car can transport 110 cubic meters of soil in 10 hours, and the average work efficiency reaches 41 cubic meters per working day.
Filling
"Pouring soil into water" dam filling method
The method of pouring loess into water to build dams is an advanced experience of the Soviet Union. This method can be used to build small and medium-sized dams in all seasons as long as there is water and suitable soil quality. Its characteristic is that the loess is poured into still water in layers, without mechanical compaction. It only uses water to destroy the loess structure, so that its particles are moistened and dispersed, and consolidated under the compaction of human soil laying, transportation tools, and the dam itself. The benefits of using this method are: the quality meets the compaction standards, the work efficiency is high, labor is saved, no compaction tools are required, the technology is low, it is easy to master, and it is not strictly controlled by seasonal climate. The method is:
I. Select the soil source and soil materials. Loess and white soil with less sand (no sand is best), no stickiness (gummy), fast wetting and penetration speed, and certain humidity are good soil materials for dam filling. The method for testing the strength of wetting and permeability and the size of stickiness is to put a 5 cubic centimeter soil block taken from the soil source into water. If it can be completely wetted within ten minutes, its stickiness and wetting permeability meet the requirements for dam filling and can be used. The particle size of the soil blocks used for dam construction should not be too large, generally not larger than 8 cm is best.
II. Construction sequence and method. First, clear the base and divide the sections and plots. After clearing the base, divide the dam base into several sections and plots according to the terrain. The height difference between the sections and plots is best to be equal. The plots in the section are best divided into squares and rectangles; sometimes due to terrain constraints, they can also be divided into trapezoids or triangles. The plot area is generally 40 to 100 square meters.
Second, build the surrounding ridges. The height and width of the surrounding ridges are determined according to the filling thickness, generally 20 to 25 centimeters is appropriate, and the side slope is 1 to 1; the surrounding ridges on the upstream and downstream sides should be made wider and compacted; the middle surrounding ridges are made of loose soil and made lower, 5 centimeters lower than the filling height; the surrounding ridges should be perpendicular or parallel to the axis, and should not be obliquely intersected with the dam axis; compact the ridges, but do not compact them too tightly, so that the water can wet them on time; when making the upper surrounding ridges, pay attention not to overlap with the lower surrounding ridges, and should be staggered by 20 to 30 meters.
III. Irrigate water into the plots and fill them. After the surrounding ridges are made, irrigate water into the plots. Both open channel irrigation and pipe irrigation are possible. The irrigation depth is 25%-40% of the filling thickness. More water should be poured into the plots that are not temporarily filled; the plots connected to the river bank and ditch bank should be poured enough water to soak for more than 24 hours. Pay attention that the water accumulation time in the plots should not be too long, and no water should be left overnight. Do not concentrate on pouring water, but pour slowly.
When the water in the plot seeps down and stabilizes for about one to two hours, start filling the soil. When filling the soil, the soil should be poured close to the edge and spread slowly, smoothing it while spreading. The water and mud squeezed out due to the filling should be discharged into adjacent plots. If there is not much mud, it can be shoveled out and spread on top of the filling. The filling direction of the upper and lower layers should be reversed. After the rain, if there is a lot of water accumulation in the soil source, the surrounding ridges can be omitted and the filling can be carried out immediately. One hour after the soil is filled, a wooden roller or stone roller can be used to lightly roll it once to enhance the density and ensure the quality. Before each layer is filled, the bottom of the plot should be loosened to a depth of 5 centimeters to make the layers tight and dense.
The above is the general construction sequence and method. In actual work, "thin mud siltation method" and "assembly line operation method" can also be adopted according to the specific situation. The former is to use the water flow to flush the soil from the high ground above the dam site down and silting it on the filling, plowing it flat one by one, then laying a layer of 1 to 2 cm thick soil, compacting it, and then continuing to siltate, proceeding in order. The latter is to build the surrounding ridges, irrigate water, and fill the soil at the same time during construction, so that several processes are staggered and carried out simultaneously. This method is suitable for larger dam surfaces. The advantages are that the soaking time of the plots is not much different, the dam body has uniform humidity, there is less thin mud, the quality is good, and the project progresses quickly. Although the "pouring soil into water" dam filling method can be carried out regardless of hot or cold weather, it should still be noted in severe winter that frozen soil should not be used to build dams, and scattered snow and frozen skin in the soil should be completely removed.
After the earth dam is built, a quality inspection should be carried out. The inspection method is to excavate test pits and take soil to test the dry capacity and moisture content of the soil. If the dry capacity of the soil per cubic centimeter reaches 1.45 grams to 1.55 grams, and the moisture content reaches 23%, the quality of the earth dam meets the standards. When taking soil in the test pit, take three types of samples in each pit, at the joints between layers and in the middle of each layer.
Ramming
Wooden foot-operated rammer
The wooden foot-operated rammer has a simple structure, is easy to use, and is suitable for various filling projects. It is operated by two people, and the ram weight is 80 kilograms. After averaging six times of ramming loess, the dry bulk density can reach more than 15 tons per cubic meter. The work efficiency is more than twice that of four people carrying a rammer.

    引洮工程治水先进工具介绍
    编者按：引洮（河）工程是甘肃省水利建设高工效的旗帜。参加这个工程的千万民工，在工程局党委的领导下，大搞技术革新，一年共创造和改良工具三十三万件。各个工序都实现了工具改革，平均日工效提高到十八点一立方。
    引洮工程的民工们所创造的各种简易机械，一般都具有制造容易、成本低、工效高等优点。现在，我们挑选了挖、装、运、填、夯几个工序的一些简易工具图和先进施工方法发表出来，供各工地参考。
    挖
    土方爆破
    一、选好爆破部位：在不损坏渠堤的原则下，炮址最好选在有三至四个临空面的山嘴底下。如果没有这样的自然地形，就采取大炮与小炮相结合、小炮与人挖相结合的方法，创造这样的地形。
    二、打炮眼：炮眼有竖眼、斜眼、曲线眼、平眼等四种，在每种炮眼内都要打出折眼线一至二米，底部装药处打成葫芦形状，这样爆破威力大，省工省药。四种炮眼各有特点，平眼开挖容易，但装药后封口不易捣实，点燃时炮火往往由炮口喷出，造成浪费。其他三种炮眼，一般挖深都在十米左右，洞口直径都在六分米至一米，开挖费工，但封口时容易捣实，炮火不易喷出。葫芦炮挖深至三米左右，炮口直径留二分米，爆破威力大。
    打眼工具主要是钢钎。打中型葫芦炮眼，钢钎愈长愈好；打大炮眼，钢钎可以短一点，一般以半米长为宜。根据红胶土的特性，使用指甲形或圆筒形钢钎工效较高。取中型葫芦炮眼内挖松的土，使用挖勺与抄铣最方便。
    三、炸药的配合比例和装炮方法：在黑色炸药内掺合食盐、硫磺、煤末、煤渣、锯末、碎石等六种物质。配合比例是：食盐占炸药的40％，硫磺占5％，锯末占60％，碎石占300％，煤末、煤渣占一倍。炸药和六种物质都不混合。
    装炮时，一般先用卵石、木屑、细煤炭，分层衬砌好炮眼底，然后把包扎好的火药放在这些杂物上，最后再用卵石、木屑、煤炭等物把药包围好（如左图），这样可以更大地发挥爆破威力。火药的包扎法是：将食盐、硫磺分层包扎或混合包扎在火药周围，用木箱或纸箱、牛皮纸、报纸包扎都可以，最后用麻绳捆紧。药捻子或电泡、雷管等都同时包扎在内（如右图）。
    四、卷捻放捻及电爆的操作方法：1、如果炮眼内水分少，比较干燥，就在炮眼底挖一个一厘米宽的小槽，将卷好的药捻子放在槽内，用小石板复盖，再分层填实洞口，进行引爆。
    2、如果炮眼内水分多，比较湿，就把卷好的药捻夹在中间凿通的木棒内，把木棒扎紧，放进炮眼中。作法是把木棒分劈两半，中间凿开一小槽，把药捻子卷成五至八毫米粗细，放在槽中，合起木棒即成。
    3、电爆黑色火药利用电泡、电池、皮线或者铅线引爆（如左上图）。电爆黄色炸药时，利用电池串连皮线引爆雷管（如左下图）。现在工地主要采用铅丝电爆。
    五、作好封口工作：这个工作很重要，如果口封不好，点燃后，火药从炮口喷出，不但不起爆破作用，反而会引起事故，造成损失。要封好口，封口土质要好，土内含水25％；并用铁、石杆子分层捣实，每层厚二分米，周围都要捣到；二要防止漏火，以免减低爆破威力。
    挖土工具
    一、多齿镐：可分为二齿、三齿、四齿三种，重约二、三公斤，适宜于黄土、红粘土、轻沙砾地段挖掘。其中以三齿镐最经济适用，比普通洋镐提高工效三倍以上，一个人一天可挖黄土一百二十到一百五十公方。
    二、撬土杠：适用于普通土、红粘土地段，两个人操作。使用铁棍三根，八磅重锤二把，硬木杠子一根，先挖好工作面的阶台，高差约一米二，再将三根铁棍平排打入土中，铁棍距边缘约零点八米，铁棍相互间的距离约零点六米，然后用木杠撬推铁棍，这样每次可以撬松普通土约一公方，平均需时二分钟，两个人一天可挖普通土二百六十公方。
    三、万能掘土器：这种掘土器除刃部外，其余都用木质做成（如右图）。使用时，先用铁锹挖一条0．5米×0．57米的沟，一人扶手把，一人前边拉，一拉一压，步调一致，切土厚度以五厘米到六厘米为宜，翻土深一般为三十七厘米到四十厘米，坡地可至五十厘米，可配合层层剥皮法挖黄土。
    装
    单人千斤起重机
    这种工具适用于大型起重安装工程，是根据杠杆及轮轴原理制成的。操作时一人向下扳动操纵杆，转动绳带动大轮，大轮带动起重杆吊起东西。起落高度二十五到三十米，效能比较高，可代替二十人操作，吊起一次需五分钟。其构造如下图：
    活头溜土槽
    这种自动装土方法应用范围很广，只要有一米以上的直壁，上有斜坡，有土可取者，都可采用。方法是在坡面上挖一上大下小的小沟渠，坡度一般为五十度到七十度，以土自动溜下为原则。为了防止土溜出车厢，槽口需加挡土板。挡板可分上翻板、下翻板、长嘴槽三种（如图一、二、三）。安装时，将活板用长钉钉在溜槽口两边田崖壁上（如果黄土安装有困难时，可在土上先钉进大木桩，再将活板转纽钉在桩的顶端），小滑轮安放在比活头板稍高的地方，再将拉绳通过小滑轮，在窑顶用钢钎钻一小眼穿下去，拴在下面的木桩上，小滑轮如发生跳轮现象，可做成图四形状。用这种方法可比人运铣装提高工效一倍。
    图一　图二  图三  图四
    运
    溜土河
    溜土河最适于土砂高劈斜运的挖运工程。安置在七至八度的斜坡上，利用土重压力，或用一、两人摇动，使河槽在驼轮上滑动，把土砂从开挖的地方运出外面，快似河水流速，在三十米的运距上，每人每天的工效最少在四十八公方以上。
  溜土河的全部结构分河槽、驼轮、浮轮、浮轮轨、支架、棱齿轮、甩轮等部分，都用木料做成。河槽：是用长零点六三米，宽零点一六米，厚二至三厘米的板子连结成的，每一块板子的两头向里一分米处钉上零点一五米高的槽壁板。整个板子用连环钩连结，连环钩的长短一定要和木板的宽窄一致，否则就不能转动。驼轮：是用二点五分米的圆板，套在八点九厘米大、零点六七米长的木棒上，木棒两头镶有直径二分米大的铁轴，用滚珠轴承安装在浮轮轨上。浮轮：是用直径五分米的圆板，套在一分米大，七分米长的木棒上，结合要端正，大小能通过河槽板壁为宜。浮轮轨：是专门支持驼轮驼过河槽的重量的。棱齿轮和甩轮，是作动力带动河槽用的，棱齿的距离与河槽板的宽窄一样，使它起齿轮的作用。溜土槽要安装成一比零点五的斜度。使用溜土河最好在土方大不易移动的地方，线路要直，要栽稳。
    剖面图连环钩高线运土
    第一种：先以大木桩二根埋在下面倒土台；一根木桩，一副紧绳绞架埋在上边装土台，再将八毫米元铁绳或三股十号或八号铅丝绳结紧在上下木桩上，铁绳穿上滑轮挂钩，下挂柳条筐或装土箱。操作时，重下轻上，使柳条筐或装土箱来回不断把土从渠道内运出。它适用于坡度较陡地段，二、三人操作，比人工抬挑提高工效六倍，运距一百米，每天每架可运土六十公方。
    第二种：其作法与上面基本相同，上下四根木桩，紧绳器移在下面，装土台较高，装土容量增加，工效比前一种提高50％。二、三人操作，一百米运距每天每架可运土九十公方。
    平线运土
    第一种：木桩埋法、紧绳安装与高线运土相同，共四根铅丝绳，每根绳上套前后两个滑轮，装土箱较长，每箱容土量零点零八公方，用于二十五分之一以内的平坡，三、四人操作，一百米运距每天每架可运土七十公方。
    第二种：仍用两根铅丝绳或八毫米元铁，安装方法与前同。每根铅丝绳上悬挂六、七个条筐成一列，每筐一个滑轮，不用引绳。上桩地点，利用一装土台，实行连续装土，一人猛力往出推送，一次一筐，土筐就连续滑行倒土。一列土筐发送完毕，另一列空土筐已由人扯回照前装土，循环工作。铅丝绳坡度可放缓至三十分之一，六人操作，一百米运距，每天每架可运土六十公方。
    双辘运土器
    由支架和立轮两部分组成。支架分为两层，下面一层，锉有木窝，并用铁片包钉，上面一层锉有圆孔一对（窝与孔的粗细，可根据立轮直径大小决定），两旁各安一对滑轮。立轮共一对，分立轴、立轮、平轮三个部分，平轮为十字形，分上下两层。操作时将两条四头引绳，通过滑轮和立轮，拴上四辆运土车，四人来回推，两人上下拉。这种工具在深达十米的渠道中取土，每人每天平均工效可达十七至二十二公方。
    水火车
    这是一种冬季施工的好工具，适用于粘土渠道平台以上的挖方工程。由于它是借滑箭在滑道上滑行，操作省力，行速很快，并且能在缓坡地带做到多装快跑。冬季倒水成冰时，对滑行更为有利。全部构造是由滑箭、浮轮、车厢、后轮等组成，使用时要配合自动装土设备（溜土槽、装土窑等）。运距为六十米时，每车在十小时内可运土一百一十公方，平均工效达到每个工日四十一公方。

    “倒土入水”筑坝填方法
    倒黄土入水筑坝的方法是苏联的先进经验，这种方法只要有水和适合的土质的地方，不分季节都可用来筑中小型坝。它的特点是将黄土分层倒入静水，不用机械压实，仅利用水来破坏黄土结构，使它的颗粒润湿、散化，在人铺土、运输工具及坝体本身的重量压实下固结起来。使用这种方法的好处是：质量合乎压实标准，工效高，节省劳力，不用夯实工具，技术性较低，容易掌握，不受季节气候的严格控制。其方法是：
    一、选择土场土料。含砂少（不含砂最好）、没有粘性（胶性）、浸湿渗透速度快、具有一定湿度的黄土、白土是筑坝填方的好土料。试验浸湿渗透性强弱和粘性大小的方法是，把从土场上采来的五立方厘米的土块放在水中，能在十分钟以内全部湿透，它的粘性和浸湿渗透性就合乎筑坝填方要求，可以采用。筑坝用的土块颗粒不要太大，一般不大于八厘米最好。
    二、施工顺序和方法。第一、清基、划分地段和地块。清基以后，根据地形将坝基划分成若干地段和地块。地段和地块之间，高差最好相等。地段中的块地最好划成正方形和长方形；有时由于地形限制，也可划成梯形或三角形。块地面积一般以四十到一百平方米为宜。
    第二、修筑围埂。围埂高宽按填方厚度而定，一般应以二十至二十五厘米为宜、边坡坡度是一比一；靠上游下游边上的围埂，应作宽一些，用夯打实；中间围埂用疏松土壤作成，作低一些，比填方高度低五厘米；围埂要与轴线垂直或平行，不能和坝轴线斜交；将埂拍紧，但不能拍的太紧，要使水能按时湿透；作上层围埂时，要注意不要与下层围埂重迭，应错开二十至三十米。
    三、向块地内灌水、进行填方。围埂作好后，便向块地灌水，明渠灌和管子灌都成。灌水深度为填方厚度25％—40％。暂时不填的块地中，要多灌一些水；和河岸沟岸相连的块地，要灌入足够的水浸至二十四小时以上。注意块地内积水时间不要过长，不留积水过夜，灌水时不要集中灌，要慢灌。
    当块地内的水经过下渗，稳定后约一至二小时，就开始填土。填土时，倒土应紧接着边缘倒，将倒下的土徐徐铺开，随铺随平整。由于填土而挤出的水和泥，应排入相邻的块地内，如泥不多可铲出铺在填土上面。上下两层的填方方向要相反进行。雨后，如土场上积水很多，可不作围埂，即行填方。填土后一小时，可用木磙或石磙轻轻压碾一遍，以增强密度，保证质量。在每层填筑前，应将块地底刨松五厘米深，使层与层之间密实。
    以上是一般的施工顺序和方法。在实际工作中，还可根据具体情况，采取“稀泥淤积法”和“流水作业法”。前者是利用水流，将坝地以上高处的土冲下来，冲积在填方上，一畦一畦刨平，再铺一层一至二厘米厚的土，压实，再接着冲积，按顺序进行下去。后者是在施工中边筑围埂，边灌水，边填土，使几个工序交错进行、同时进行。这种方法适应于较大面积的坝面，优点是块地浸水时间相差不大，坝体湿度均匀，稀泥少、质量好，工程进展也快。“倒土入水”筑坝填方法虽然不分热冷天气都可以进行，但在严冬时仍应注意不能用冻土筑坝，土内散雪和冻皮均应除尽。
    土坝筑成后，要进行质量检查，检查方法是开挖试坑，取土检验土的干容量和含水量。每立方厘米土的干容量如达到一点四五克至一点五五克，含水量如达到23％，土坝的质量就合乎标准。在试坑内取土时，每坑取三种试样，在层与层的结槎处及每层的中间取。
