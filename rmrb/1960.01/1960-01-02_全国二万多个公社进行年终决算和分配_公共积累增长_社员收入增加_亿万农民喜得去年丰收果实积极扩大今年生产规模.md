Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: People's communes in rural areas across the country are carrying out year-end accounting and distribution for 1959. Judging from the accounting and distribution, the assets of each of China's people's communes have greatly increased after a year of production and operation. The public accumulation of communes and teams, and the income of commune members have increased compared with 1958.

The more than 20,000 people's communes and the more than 500,000 basic accounting units (production teams, production brigades, or management areas) nationwide have seen great development in all aspects of production in 1959. Communes everywhere have commune-run industries and other commune-run enterprises. Compared with the agricultural cooperatives of the past, the income items have increased. For example, the communes in Fujian Province generally have seven or eight to more than a dozen income items, such as commune-run industry, logging, animal husbandry, fishery, transportation, various handicrafts, orchards, and tea gardens. The income of the teams also includes many items such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. This fully demonstrates that the scope of commune operations is extensive, resulting in increased income; it also demonstrates the significant development of rural industry and diversified operations since collectivization. According to surveys in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang provinces, the income of commune-run enterprises in general reaches several hundred thousand to several million yuan in many cases. The income of commune-run enterprises in the suburbs of Shanghai generally reaches around 2 million yuan. The income of commune-run enterprises in Po Hu Commune, Changge County, Henan, reaches over 3 million yuan. According to a survey of 26 communes in Changsha County, Hunan, the average income of commune-run enterprises per commune reaches more than 800,000 yuan. The income of commune-run enterprises in areas with less income, such as Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia, generally ranges from several tens of thousands to more than a hundred thousand yuan per commune. This is a new source of income that was completely absent in rural areas before collectivization.

In 1959, the total income of the basic accounting units and contract production units (production groups or production teams) of communes in various places also increased greatly compared with 1958. According to surveys in sixteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, including Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Jilin, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, Anhui, and Beijing, the increase generally reaches 10% or more, with a few reaching around 40%. The income of basic accounting units mainly comes from agricultural production. In 1959, some teams in Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Shaanxi, and other provinces that suffered particularly severe disasters experienced reduced production. However, some teams increased production of cash crops even though grain crops decreased; or although agriculture decreased, the forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, etc., run by the teams increased production. The income of production brigades in Henan Province still increased by more than 10% compared with 1958, and the total income of brigades and contract production units in the province still increased by more than 20% compared with 1958. According to statistics from more than 14,700 brigades in the four regions of Xuchang, Nanyang, Xinxiang, and Kaifeng alone, only more than 700 had lower incomes than in 1958, with the majority increasing their income. In 1959, the production income level of many poor teams in various provinces caught up with or approached that of rich teams in just one year. Under the circumstances of the extraordinary disasters in 1959, the increase in production and income of people's communes and the vast majority of basic accounting units across the country fully demonstrated the superiority of people's communes.

As a result of the economic development and increased income of communes and teams, public accumulation has generally increased significantly on the one hand, and more than 90% of commune members across the country have increased their income compared with 1958 on the other hand. In 1959, the average income of the rural population nationwide exceeded that of 1958. According to surveys in eighteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions: the income distributed to commune members by teams and contract production units in 1959 has increased, with larger increases in Ningxia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Zhejiang, and other provinces and autonomous regions. Due to the increase in distributed portions, commune members in five provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country will have an average income of more than 100 yuan per person. Anhui Province can reach around 100 yuan, an increase of 20% compared with 1958. In 1958, more than 80 poor teams in eighteen communes in Pingjiang County, Hunan, had an average income of less than 50 yuan per person. In 1959, most reached 60 or 70 yuan, and a small number reached 80 or 90 yuan. Xifan Brigade of Jiangxiang Commune, Nanchang County, Jiangxi, is a famous poor team. In the past, the income of commune members was less than 30 yuan, but in 1959, the income of commune members exceeded 100 yuan. Regarding the accumulation situation: the public accumulation of all people's communes in various provinces and regions (the profits of commune-level enterprises plus the accumulation extracted from various production teams) is as high as 300 to 500 million yuan, and generally 100 to 200 million yuan. According to a survey of 59 communes in Mengjin, Lankao, Jiyuan, and other counties in Henan, the public accumulation at the commune level reached a total of 24.44 million yuan, an increase of 2.3 times compared with 1958. The accumulation of production teams in various places has also increased significantly. In 1959, the public accumulation of communes and production brigades in Henan could reach more than 700 million yuan, an increase of more than 50% compared with 1958. In addition, the number of communes and teams that stored grain in 1959 also greatly increased compared with 1958.

Now, China's people's communes have considerable assets, and their economic foundation is thicker than before. Every commune has farms, forest farms, livestock farms, fishing grounds, various factories and mines, and handicraft workshops. In the past year of 1959, each commune used the income from commune-run enterprises and state investment to not only set up many undertakings, but also added many things that agricultural cooperatives in the past would not have dared to think of. For example, Jinggang Commune in Changsha County, Hunan, bought eleven tractors and more than thirty water pumps in the past year, and also carried out a lot of farmland capital construction.

Now, under the leadership of the Party, the people's communes across the country continue to advance victoriously, vigorously engaging in farmland capital construction such as water conservancy construction, vigorously raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, and striving for a greater leap forward in 1960. In making production plans for 1960, many people's communes are preparing to further develop commune-run enterprises, especially commune-run industries that serve agriculture, and expand the scale of production in industries such as farm tool factories and agricultural product processing factories, as well as agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Many communes have allocated a considerable amount of funds for 1960 to gradually carry out agricultural mechanization. The communes in Heilongjiang have decided that in 1960, funds will be mainly used in several aspects such as agricultural mechanization, developing commune-run industries and diversified operations, and continuing to assist poor teams. Po Hu Commune in Changge County, Henan, plans to buy a batch of tractors, trucks, and power machinery in 1960. In addition, due to the increase in commune and team welfare funds, communes in various places have also appropriately expanded public canteens, nurseries, and cultural and health undertakings that serve commune members, based on the principle of diligence and thrift. These situations all show that the people's communes across the country, which have achieved great achievements, are welcoming the new victory of 1960 with full confidence.

    全国二万多个公社进行年终决算和分配
    公共积累增长　社员收入增加
    亿万农民喜得去年丰收果实积极扩大今年生产规模
    新华社1日讯　全国农村人民公社正在进行1959年年终决算和分配。从决算和分配的情况来看：我国人民公社经过一年的生产经营，每个社的资产都有了很大的增长。社、队公共积累和社员收入都比1958年增加。
    全国二万多个人民公社，五十多万个基本核算单位（生产队、生产大队或管理区），1959年各项生产都有很大的发展。各地公社都有社办工业和其他社办企业，与过去农业社比较，收入项目增加了。像福建省的公社一般都有社办工业、伐木业、饲养业、渔业、运输业、各种手工业、果园、茶园等七、八项到十几项收入。队的收入也包括农、林、牧、副、渔等好多项。这充分说明公社经营范围广泛，因而收入增多；也说明公社化以来农村工业和多种经营有显著发展。据上海、浙江、河南、湖北、广东、辽宁和黑龙江等省调查，一般公社社办企业的收入达几十万元到几百万元的很多。上海全市郊区公社社办企业收入一般达二百万元左右。河南长葛县坡胡公社社办企业收入达三百万元以上。据湖南长沙县二十六个公社的调查，每社社办企业收入平均达八十多万元，社办企业收入较少的如新疆、宁夏、内蒙古每个公社社办企业的收入，一般也有几万元到十几万元不等。这是公社化以前农村完全没有的一笔新的收入。
    1959年，各地公社的基本核算单位和包产单位（生产小队或生产队）的总收入，也比1958年有很大的增长。据黑龙江、陕西、吉林、贵州、广西、云南、安徽、北京等十六个省、市、自治区调查，增长幅度一般达10％以上，少数高的达40％左右。基本核算单位的收入主要来自农业生产。1959年受灾特别严重的湖北、河南、安徽、陕西等省，都有一部分队减产。可是，有的队虽然粮食作物减产但经济作物增产；或者虽然农业减产，但队办的林、牧、副业等增了产。河南省的生产大队收入比1958年增加的仍达10％以上，全省大队和包产单位的总收入仍比1958年增长了20％以上。仅据许昌、南阳、新乡、开封四个专区的一万四千七百多大队统计，收入比1958年低的只有七百多个，大多数都增加了收入。1959年各省都有不少穷队的生产收入水平一年就赶上或者接近了富队。在1959年特大灾害的情况下，全国人民公社和绝大多数基本核算单位增产增收，这充分显示了人民公社的优越性。
    社队经济发展和收入增加的结果，一方面公共积累普遍有显著的增加，一方面全国90％以上的社员比1958年增加了收入。1959年全国农村人口的平均收入超过了1958年。据十八个省市区的调查：1959年队和包产单位分给社员的收入都有增长，增长幅度较大的有宁夏、黑龙江、吉林、浙江等省、自治区。由于分配部分增加，全国将有五个省、市、自治区的社员，每人平均收入可超过一百元。安徽省可达百元左右，比1958年增长了20％。湖南平江县十八个公社，1958年有八十多个穷队的每人平均收入不到五十元，1959年大部达到了六、七十元，小部分达到了八、九十元。江西南昌县蒋巷公社西樊大队是个著名穷队，过去社员收入不到三十元，1959年社员收入超过了一百元。关于积累方面的情况：各省区全部人民公社的公共积累（公社一级的企业利润加上提取各生产队的积累），多的有三、五亿元，一般也有一、两亿元。据河南孟津、兰考、济源等县五十九个公社调查，公社一级的公共积累共达二千四百四十四万元，比1958年增加二点三倍。各地生产队的积累也有显著增加。河南1959年公社和生产大队的公共积累可达七亿元以上，比1958年提高了50％以上。此外，1959年储备了粮食的社、队也比1958年大大增多。
    现在我国人民公社都有了相当的家当，经济底子较前更厚。每一个公社都有农场、林场、牧场、渔场、各种厂矿和手工业工场。1959年一年来，每个公社用社办企业的收入和国家的投资，不仅办了很多事业，还添置了很多过去农业社想都不敢想的东西，如湖南长沙县靖港公社，一年来就买了十一台拖拉机和三十多台抽水机，还搞了很多农田基本建设。
    现在，全国人民公社在党的领导下继续胜利前进，正在大搞兴修水利等农田基本建设，大搞养猪积肥，争取1960年的更大跃进。很多人民公社在作1960年的生产规划中，准备进一步发展社办企业特别是为农业服务的社办工业，扩大农具厂和农产品加工厂等工业和农牧副渔的生产规模。不少公社为1960年拨出了一笔可观的资金，逐步搞农业机械化。黑龙江的公社决定1960年资金主要用在农业机械化、发展社办工业和多种经营、继续扶助穷队等几个方面。河南长葛县坡胡公社1960年计划买一批拖拉机、载重汽车和动力机械。此外，由于社队公益金增加，各地公社在勤俭的原则下还适当地扩充了为社员服务的公共食堂、托儿所和文化卫生事业。这些情况都说明取得了伟大成就的全国人民公社，正信心百倍地迎接1960年新的胜利。
