Pig raising proverbs:
	A good sow, a good litter; a good boar, a good hillside of offspring.
	×　× Pigs eat a hundred kinds of grass; see if you can find them.
	×　× Pigs are a treasure bowl; their whole body is gold and silver.
	×　× Often add bedding to the pigsty and collect eggs from the chicken coop; diligent legs and quick hands accumulate more fertilizer.
	×　× Separate the old, weak, sick, and disabled into different pens; so that each one can eat their fill and become plump.
	×　× The trough should be clean and the pen dry; the pigs will be strong and full of vitality.
	×　× One pig per mu; low yield becomes high yield.
	×　× Build pig farms at the edge of the fields; saves time transporting fertilizer.
