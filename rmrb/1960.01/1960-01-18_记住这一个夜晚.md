    Remember This One Night
    Lin Sheng
    A dark night, a group of innocent orphans were sound asleep in their dreams. Perhaps they were dreaming again of their lost parents, perhaps dreaming of... But before their sweet dreams were over, they were awakened by their nanny, who told them she would take them out to play. But a sensible child said: I know, the Germans are coming. Yes, the Germans are coming. According to Hitler's orders, the German SS was to cleanse Norway of its Jewish population overnight. And they were Jewish children. Their parents were killed by Hitler, and now Hitler's butcher knife was aimed at these innocent children. On this critical night, kind people risked danger to rescue these innocent children from the clutches of the Nazis. The Norwegian film "One Night Like This" begins in this way.
    Although the plot of "One Night Like This" is relatively simple, it reflects an important aspect of World War II. Hitler wanted to pave the way for his war of aggression by creating racial hatred. But all righteous people stood up to fight against fascism. The film vigorously praises the indomitable will of the kind Norwegian people to resist atrocities and resist invaders. When we see Grandma Marlen stealing milk from Nazi soldiers to feed the children and being caught by the police, how much we want to embrace this respectable and lovely grandmother and soothe her kind heart.
    The film also ruthlessly exposes and condemns the crimes of German fascism. What is particularly interesting is that the filmmakers, through the mouth of a desperate fascist officer, say: "Fully armed soldiers playing hide-and-seek with little kids, what is this, it's really a dirty war"; in this respect, the film makes people deeply believe that the enemy, no matter how crazy, is bound to fail, and the just struggle of the people will eventually triumph.
    The era depicted in this film has passed more than a decade, and Hitler has long been buried by the people. But fascist bacteria, now cultivated in the United States and West Germany, are once again spreading and growing in West German territory. Isn't it? Today, anti-Semitic winds are blowing again around the world. The heinous fascist swastika and the shouts of "Kill the Jews" have reappeared before people's eyes. This proves that those who want to create "dirty wars" have not given up, and people still need to be vigilant. Therefore, "One Night Like This" has practical significance when it is shown today.

    记住这一个夜晚
    林笙
    一个黑沉沉的夜晚，一群天真无邪的孤儿正沉睡在梦乡里。也许他们重又梦见了失去的双亲，也许梦见……。然而甜蜜的梦还没有做完，他们就被阿姨叫醒了，说要带他们出去玩。但是一个懂事的孩子说：我知道，德国人要来了。是的，德国人要来了，根据希特勒的命令德国党卫军要在一夜之间把居住在挪威的犹太人清洗掉。而他们正是犹太人的孩子。他们的父母就是被希特勒杀害的，现在希特勒的屠刀又扑向这群无辜的孩子们。就在这个危急的夜晚，善良的人们不避艰险地把这群无辜的孩子从纳粹的魔掌中拯救出来。挪威电影“如此一个夜晚”就是这样开始的。
    “如此一个夜晚”的故事情节虽然比较简单，但是它反映了第二次世界大战中一个重要的侧面。希特勒想用制造种族仇恨来为他的侵略战争铺平道路。但是一切正义的人们都站起来同法西斯进行斗争。电影有力地歌颂了善良的挪威人民反抗暴行、反抗侵略者的不屈的意志，当我们看到马仑奶奶为了哺育孩子们去偷纳粹分子的牛奶被警察抓住，我们多么想去拥抱这一个可敬而又可爱的奶奶，去抚慰她那颗善良的心。
    电影也无情地揭露和谴责了德国法西斯的罪行。特别有意思的是，电影作者通过绝望的法西斯军官的口说：“全副武装的兵士去和毛孩子捉迷藏，这算什么，真是一场肮脏的战争”；电影在这一点上使人深信敌人尽管疯狂，但是必然失败，而人民的正义斗争终将胜利。
    这部电影所描绘的年代已经过去十几年了，希特勒也早已被人民埋葬了。但是法西斯的细菌现在却又在美国和西德的培殖下，重又在德国西部领土上蔓生滋长。不是吗？今天在世界各地又刮起了排犹的阴风。万恶的法西斯卐字和“杀死犹太人”的嚎叫又重新出现在人们的眼前。这证明那些想制造“肮脏战争”的人并没有死心，人们还需要警惕。因此，“如此一个夜晚”在今天放映是有现实意义的。
