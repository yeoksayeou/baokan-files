Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, on-the-spot conferences, initiated and promoted in various regions, represent the concrete application of the Marxist leadership and work methods consistently advocated by Chairman Mao, such as "combining general appeals with individual guidance," "combining leadership with the masses," "from the masses, to the masses," and "using the advanced to drive the backward." The recent comprehensive winter work on-the-spot conference convened by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has added new content to on-the-spot conferences. Based on the development needs of winter work in the province, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China selected some advanced regions and units, bringing together the first secretaries of the province, prefectures (cities), and counties, as well as relevant responsible cadres, to converge on the sites. They adopted a method of simultaneous observation (on-site visits), listening (to typical introductions), discussion (expressing views on typical experiences), decision-making (making decisions after some experiences and issues have been deliberated), writing (drafting and revising documents based on discussions and resolutions), and action (visiting and holding meetings simultaneously). They visited advanced models, listened to introductions of advanced experiences, and conducted practical rectification, discussing theory based on reality, using these advanced examples and experiences to boost revolutionary vigor. These advanced examples and experiences were centralized, and through the connections of the comrades attending the meeting with various regions, combined inside and outside the meeting, and rapidly promoted. This kind of comprehensive on-the-spot conference is, in essence, a summary of the rich and comprehensive experiences of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. Therefore, it comprehensively promoted the work, improved the leadership level, and facilitated a deeper and more comprehensive implementation of the Party's General Line, achieving a better and more comprehensive leap forward.

Since the Great Leap Forward, many leading organs have promoted work and guided movements by holding on-the-spot conferences, achieving significant results. The recent on-the-spot conference convened by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is a further specific application of this new development in leadership and work methods. This comprehensive on-the-spot conference convened by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China had diverse models at the conference site, including mountain management, water control, fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, and the development of diversified economies. Through on-site visits to these rich and colorful advanced models and introductions of advanced experiences, closely combining theory and practice, it not only promoted a certain aspect of work but also promoted the entire winter work of a province, and organically combined the various central tasks of winter, thus leading to rapid action and significant results. This on-the-spot conference was not limited to the introduction and promotion of general work experience but also organized leading cadres at all levels in the province to conduct practical study in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The sites selected for the entire conference were not only typical regions with advanced work and rich experience but also advanced regions with strong revolutionary will, full of drive, and possessing the spirit to move mountains and overturn seas. These regions had relatively poor natural conditions, but they created outstanding achievements that were even more advanced than those in regions with better objective conditions. This vivid objective reality gave people a profound education. Since hilly areas could make the land very flat, the cultivated land in plain areas should not be uneven; since mountainous and low-lying areas could achieve high yields, good fields and irrigated land should not achieve only small yields; since rocky mountains and bare ridges could be afforested, afforestation in general areas should achieve twice the result with half the effort, and the speed should be faster. Things can be compared to show their differences. This is both an on-the-spot conference and an on-the-spot exhibition. From practice to theory, from cause to effect, it gives people vivid and profound impressions. Backward units are deeply moved and determined to catch up with the advanced, and advanced units are encouraged, listen to valuable opinions, and obtain conditions for further improvement. Currently, the labor force in the winter production movement in Shandong Province has reached more than 20 million people, and great achievements have been made in various productions. As of the end of December 1959, in terms of water conservancy construction, 1.55 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work had been completed. The combination of theory and practice will generate enormous power. The on-the-spot conference convened by the Shandong Provincial Committee played an important role in promoting this.

This conference emphasized linking theory with practice, discussing theory based on reality, that is, discussing ideological "theory" based on the "reality" of the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, the ideological level of the comrades participating in the conference was generally improved, and revolutionary vigor was greatly increased. From a theoretical point of view, the essence of the Great Leap Forward was understood, and the understanding level of cadres was improved. Chairman Mao said: Only when perceptual material is very rich and in line with reality can correct concepts and reasoning be created based on such material. When theory and reality are well combined, concrete experience is easy to see clearly, easy to listen to, and can form "correct concepts and reasoning" in one's own mind, making it easier to promote. The on-the-spot conference convened by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China fully illustrates this point. The comrades attending the meeting generally expressed: "Seeing is understanding, listening is comprehension, and thinking is enlightenment." Everyone realized that revolutionary vigor is boosted in struggle, advanced experience is discovered in production movements, and good working methods are explored in practice. It is truly a case of politics taking command, ideology leading the way, grasping the key link to bring along everything else, and opening the door to smooth progress in various tasks. Emphasizing simultaneous observation, listening, discussion, decision-making, writing, and action is precisely to fully grasp all aspects of holding a good on-the-spot conference, rather than simply visiting and taking what one likes, or simply discussing without making decisions, or making decisions without taking action, which prevents the on-the-spot conference from achieving its due effect. Simultaneous observation, listening, and discussion can further enrich and improve advanced experience, unify everyone's thinking and understanding, and prevent everyone from doing things their own way when promoting it. Simultaneous discussion, decision-making, and writing allow the written documents and resolutions to have both clear principles and rich practical content, better guiding the work; it can avoid the shortcomings of building a cart behind closed doors and reduce the mistakes of subjectivism and bureaucracy.

The most important reason why this conference was relatively successful is that the first secretaries of the province, prefectures (cities), and counties, as well as the secretaries in charge of rural work and responsible persons of relevant departments, were brought together to observe, summarize, and exchange advanced experiences in various aspects from a practical standpoint and with a higher ideological level. It also facilitated the implementation of simultaneous observation, listening, discussion, decision-making, writing, and action. These comrades are the backbone of leading and grasping the work of the entire province. Their ideological understanding achieved consensus, and they truly understood and grasped advanced experience. Once they make a decision, the work of the entire province will naturally move with one stroke, and a new high tide of production will soon appear. Before convening this on-the-spot conference, the responsible comrades of the Shandong Provincial Committee not only went down to personally understand the situation and discover advanced models in various tasks but also deeply understood the various main ideological problems of cadres and masses in winter production. Aiming at the ideology and the current work, they carefully selected the location for holding the on-the-spot conference, the objects to be visited and studied, and the issues to be discussed. Because politics took command, the conference naturally became lively and vigorous, with ideological exchange, solving practical work problems and ideological understanding problems, giving the comrades attending the meeting a profound ideological education, and greatly boosting revolutionary vigor on the basis of improving ideology. Chairman Mao said in the article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that without a correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul. Without a correct political viewpoint, all work will inevitably be characterized by being slow, small in scale, poor in quality, and wasteful. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China truly achieved political command in preparing for this comprehensive on-the-spot conference, and as a result, it promoted the work, improved the ideological level of cadres, and achieved the expected results.

All of our work requires us to be more and more meticulous and more and more in-depth, and therefore we must increasingly pay attention to leadership methods and working methods, and better improve our ideological level and leadership level. The success of the Shandong comprehensive on-the-spot conference provides a model for improving leadership methods, which is worth learning from in various regions.

    一个成功的现场会议
    1958年大跃进以来各地创造和推行的现场会议，是毛主席一贯倡导的“一般号召和个别指导相结合”、“领导和群众相结合”、“从群众中来，到群众中去”、“以先进带动落后”这一马克思主义的领导方法和工作方法的具体运用。中共山东省委最近召开的一次冬季工作综合性的现场会议，又给现场会议增添了新的内容。中共山东省委根据该省冬季工作发展的需要，选择了部分先进地区、单位，集中省、地（市）县的第一书记和有关的负责干部，会师现场，采用边看（就地参观）、边听（听典型介绍）、边议（对典型经验发表议论）、边决（有些经验和问题酝酿成熟之后即作出决定）、边写（根据讨论决议，起草和修改文件）、边行（一面参观开会一面行动）的方法，参观了先进的典型，听取了先进经验的介绍，并且进行实际整风，就实论虚，用这些先进的典型实例和先进经验，大鼓革命干劲。将这些先进的典型事例和先进经验集中起来，通过到会同志对各地联系，会内会外结合，迅速推广开来。这种综合性的现场会议，实质上也就是社会主义建设大跃进的、丰富的、全面的经验总结。因而全面地推动了工作，提高了领导水平，便于更深入，更全面地贯彻党的总路线，实现更好更全面的跃进。
    大跃进以来，许多领导机关都通过召开现场会议推动工作，指导运动，并且获得显著的成效，中共山东省委最近召开的这次现场会议，更是进一步具体应用这一领导方法和工作方法的新发展。中共山东省委这次召开的综合性的现场会议，会议的现场，有治山、治水、积肥、绿化、发展多种经济等多种多样的典型，通过对这些丰富多彩的先进典型的实地参观和先进经验的介绍，理论与实际密切结合，不仅仅推动某一项工作，而是推动了一个省整个冬季的工作，并使冬季各项中心工作有机地结合起来，这样就会行动快而收效大。这个现场会议，还不仅仅限于一般工作经验的介绍和推广，而是按照党的八届八中全会的精神，组织全省的各级领导骨干实际学习。整个会议所选择的现场，不仅是工作先进、经验丰富的典型地区，而且是一些革命意志坚强，干劲十足，具有移山倒海气概的先进地区。这些地区，自然条件比较差，但是他们却创造出了比其他客观条件较好的地区还先进的优异成绩。这一生动的客观现实，给人以深刻的教育。既然丘陵地区能把地整得很平坦，平原地区的耕地就更不该是高低不平；既然山地洼地能够大丰产，良田水地就更不应该小丰产；既然石山光岭能绿化，一般地区的绿化就更应该事半功倍，速度更快。事情只要一比较就可以显出高低来。这是一种现场会议，又是一种现场展览。从实践到理论，从原因到结果，都给人们以极生动的深刻的印象，落后单位深受感动，决心追赶先进的，先进单位受到鼓励，也听取了宝贵意见，获得进一步提高的条件。目前山东全省冬季生产运动的劳动大军达两千余万人，各项生产取得了很大的成绩。截至1959年12月底止，在水利建设方面，已完成土石方工程十五点五亿立方米。理论结合实际，就会产生巨大无比的力量，山东省委召开的现场会议，起了重要的推动作用。
    这次会议强调理论联系实际，就实论虚，即就大跃进之“实”，论思想之“虚”，因此，参加会议的同志思想水平普遍提高，革命干劲大增。从理论上认识了大跃进的实质，提高了干部的认识水平。毛主席说：只有感觉的材料十分丰富，和合于实际，才能根据这样的材料造出正确的概念和论理来。虚实结合得好，具体经验就容易看得清楚，听得进去，并能在自己的思想中形成“正确的概念和论理”，这样推广起来也就容易了。中共山东省委这次召开的现场会议，充分地说明了这个问题，与会同志普遍表示：一看就明，一听就懂，一想就通。大家体会到革命干劲是在斗争中鼓起来的，先进经验是在生产运动中钻出来的，好的工作方法是在实践中摸索到的。真是政治挂了帅，思想领了先，纲举目张，各项工作打开顺利前进之门。强调边看、边听、边议、边决、边写、边行，也正是完整地抓住了开好现场会议的各个环节，而不是仅仅参观一番，各取所好，或者只是议论一番，议而不决，决而不行，使现场会议不能收到应有的效果。边看、边听、边议，就可以将先进经验进一步丰富提高，就可以统一大家的思想认识，就不致于推广起来各行其事。边议、边决、边写，写出的文件和决议，就可以既有明确原则，又有丰富的实际内容，更好地指导工作；就可以避免闭门造车的缺点，少犯主观主义、官僚主义的毛病。
    这个会议所以开得比较成功，还有一个最重要的原因，就是省、地（市）县三级第一书记和专管农村工作的书记以及有关部门的负责人都集中起来，从实际出发，用较高的思想水平来观察、总结、交流各方面的先进经验，同时也便于实行边看，边听，边议，边决，边写，边行。这些同志是领导和掌握全省工作的骨干，他们的思想认识获得一致，又切实领会和掌握了先进经验，只要决心一下，全省工作就自然会一举百动，生产新高潮就会很快出现。中共山东省委在召开这个现场会议以前，省的负责同志不但先下去亲自了解情况，发现各项工作中的先进典型，而且深入了解干部和群众在冬季生产中的各种主要的思想问题，针对思想，针对当前的工作，认真选定召开现场会议的地点，要参观学习的对象，要议论的问题。由于政治挂了帅，会议就自然开得生动活泼，思想见面，既解决实际工作问题，又解决思想认识问题，给到会的同志以深刻的思想教育，在提高思想的基础上更大地鼓足了革命干劲。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中说过，没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。一切工作离开了正确的政治观点，必然是少、慢、差、费。中共山东省委在准备召开这次综合现场会议时，真正做到了政治挂帅，结果，推动了工作，提高了干部思想水平，收到了预期的效果。
    我们的一切工作都要求越作越细，越作越深入，因而也就必需要越来越讲求领导方法和工作方法，更好地提高思想水平和领导水平。山东综合性现场会议的成功，提供了一个改进领导方法的范例，值得各地学习。
