Cheer for the Continued Great Leap Forward of the Motherland!
Xu Dixing

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have overfulfilled the 1959 plan for developing the national economy and have victoriously completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. According to the communique on the development of the national economy in 1959, the total value of industrial and agricultural output in that year was 241.3 billion yuan (exceeding the planned figure by 20.45 billion yuan), an increase of 94.4% over the total value of industrial and agricultural output in 1957 (the Second Five-Year Plan originally stipulated an increase of about 75% by 1962), and an increase of 31.1% over 1958. In terms of the total value of industrial output, the actual figure was 163 billion yuan (exceeding the planned figure by 16 billion yuan), an increase of 131.5% over 1957 (the Second Five-Year Plan originally stipulated an increase of about 100% by 1962), and an increase of 39.3% over 1958. Of this 163 billion yuan of total industrial output value, means of production accounted for 96 billion yuan, which was 290.9% of 1957 and 143.3% of 1958; consumer goods accounted for 67 billion yuan, which was 179.1% of 1957 and 134% of 1958. The total output value in agriculture was 78.3 billion yuan, an increase of 45.8% over 1957 (the Second Five-Year Plan originally stipulated an increase of about 35%), and an increase of 16.7% over 1958. Premier Zhou pointed out in his "Report on Adjusting the Main Targets of the 1959 National Economic Plan and Further Developing the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy": "According to the speed of economic construction development in socialist countries and the construction experience of my country's First Five-Year Plan, an annual increase of more than 20% in industry is a leap forward, an increase of more than 25% is a great leap forward, and an increase of more than 30% is a particularly great leap forward; an annual increase of more than 10% in agriculture is a leap forward, an increase of more than 15% is a great leap forward, and an increase of more than 20% is a particularly great leap forward." Then, the facts of 1958 and 1959 prove that my country's national economy is constantly making great leaps forward.

Why can my country's socialist construction cause develop comprehensively at the speed of a Great Leap Forward? The most fundamental reason is that my country has established a socialist system. The socialist system has solved the antagonistic contradictions between the productive forces and the relations of production that cannot be solved in capitalist society, and has solved the contradiction between the complete separation of the means of production and the producers under the capitalist system. Regardless of ownership by the whole people or collective ownership, the possessors of the means of production and the producers are not opposed to each other, but are unified. The producers are the masters of the means of production, and the fruits of production are no longer plundered by a few exploiters but belong to all members of society. The limitations imposed on the productive forces by class society and the exploitation system have been negated. The socialist public ownership of the means of production makes it possible for people to establish comradely, cooperative, and mutually supportive relationships in the production process and in social life. This kind of comradely, cooperative, and mutually supportive relationship is clearly manifested in socialist competition. Here, the advanced give help to the backward, allowing the backward to catch up with and even surpass themselves, while they themselves make even greater efforts to surpass those who have surpassed them. At the same time, the socialist public ownership of the means of production makes it possible for the distribution of our national income to be realized in a way that is conducive to expanding socialist reproduction and to the continuous improvement and enhancement of the material and cultural living standards of the working people. In this way, socialist relations of production become an important aspect of constantly promoting the development of social productive forces. This superiority of the socialist system is the basis for the high-speed development of the national economy. Of course, contradictions still exist in the socialist system. In socialist society, the basic contradiction is still the contradiction betwen relations of production and the productive forces, the contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base. However, the contradictions of socialist society are fundamentally different in nature from the contradictions of class societies, such as capitalist society. The contradictions of socialist society are not antagonistic contradictions, "it can be continuously resolved through the socialist system itself." It is precisely because socialist relations of production and its superstructure can be constantly adjusted and innovated according to needs, that the productive forces of socialist society can continue to surge forward; in this way, the high-speed development of the national economy becomes the objective law of the socialist economy.

However, this superiority of socialism is an objective thing, and the extent to which this superiority can be brought into play depends on people's subjective efforts and the correctness of the Party's line and policies. The great victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front in my country in 1956 enabled us to basically solve the problem of private ownership of the means of production and basically establish socialist relations of production throughout the country, which laid the material foundation for the high-speed development of the national economy. The great victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in 1957 not only thoroughly defeated the anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois rightists, and profoundly changed the balance of class forces in our country, but also formed a great ideological liberation of communism among the broadest masses of the people, setting off a revolutionary enthusiasm for socialist construction. It was under this situation that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The general line of socialist construction is proposed by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developing the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism on socialist construction. It gives full play to the subjective dynamic role of the masses of the people and turns the objective possibility of high-speed socialist development into reality.

The essence of the Party's general line for socialist construction is a high degree of attention to the consciousness, initiative, and creativity of the people in building the socialist cause. Therefore, it requires large-scale mass movements in all aspects of socialist construction. The requirements of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results are to call on the 650 million people to give full play to their subjective dynamic role within the scope of objective laws, and to require the fastest possible development speed in production and construction, and to give full play to economic results. The mass movement under the leadership of the Party is a combination of political work and economic work, and a combination of political education and material encouragement for the masses, with politics in command. Such a mass movement is bound to become a driving force for the high-speed development of the national economy. At the same time, the Party's general line requires the implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy in socialist construction. This can not only give full play to the active role of the masses, but also avoid one-sidedness, avoid paying attention to one aspect and ignoring another, so that all aspects can develop in a coordinated and proportionate manner. In the national economy, the most important proportional relationships are the proportional relationships between industry and agriculture, and between heavy industry and light industry. If these two most basic proportional relationships are arranged well, the national economy can develop at a high speed, and a set of "walking on two legs" policies, especially the policies of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously and developing heavy industry and light industry simultaneously, precisely points out a clear direction for arranging the basic proportional relationships of the national economy. The Party's general line of socialist construction concentrates the objective law of high-speed socialist development, concentrates the lofty aspirations of the 650 million people, and concentrates the greatest interests and most urgent demands of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, it was quickly grasped by the masses and became a great material force, further improving the socialist consciousness of the masses, and fully developing their revolutionary drive and creative spirit. The continuous leap forward in my country's socialist cause is unthinkable without the Party's general line of socialist construction.

In the Great Leap Forward, the vast countryside of my country has realized the people's communeization. The emergence of the people's commune reflects the requirement that the relations of production and the superstructure must be suitable for the development of productive forces, and solves the contradiction that advanced agricultural cooperatives cannot further adapt to the development of productive forces. This has promoted the leap forward in agriculture and the entire national economy. The greatest superiority of the people's commune is prominently manifested in the struggle to overcome serious disasters in 1959, in the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, in the rapid development of commune-run industries, and also in public canteens and collective welfare undertakings. The people's commune makes it possible for us to realize agricultural modernization in the countryside more quickly, thereby guaranteeing the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. The comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production provides a huge material force for the Great Leap Forward of the entire national economy. It enables light industry to obtain more raw materials and makes the market obtain richer materials. These are all manifestations of the people's commune promoting the continued Great Leap Forward of the entire national economy. Not only that, but the people's commune also directly participates in the cause of various departments of the national economy with its powerful forces, promoting the development of these causes; it also needs an increasing number of heavy industrial products to arm itself, thereby promoting the continuous and high-speed advancement of heavy industry.

We already have a socialist system with high-speed development, and we also have the Party's general line and the people's commune. This enables our national economy to continuously and continuously leap forward, enabling us to greatly increase the original targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in the next three years, and we can free up more strength to strengthen the weak links in the national economy, so that my country's socialist construction can continue to develop at a high speed and proportionally.

Through the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, the situation of high-speed and proportionate leap forward of my country's national economy has been completely laid down. As long as we continue to implement the Party's general line and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, and further give play to the superiority of the people's commune, we will not only be able to strive for a continued leap forward in 1960 on the basis of the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, but also be able to continuously maintain the leap forward and Great Leap Forward of the national economy in the years to come!

    为祖国的继续大跃进而欢呼！
    许涤新
    中国人民在党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，已经超额地完成了1959年发展国民经济的计划，已经提前三年胜利地完成第二个五年计划的主要指标了。根据1959年国民经济发展情况的公报，这一年的工农业总产值是二千四百一十三亿元（比计划数字超过二百零四点五亿元），这个数字，比1957年的工农业总产值增长94．4％（第二个五年计划原定1962年增长75％左右），比1958年增长31．1％。以工业总产值来说，执行数字是一千六百三十亿元（比计划数字超过一百六十亿元），这个数字，比1957年增长131．5％（第二个五年计划原定1962年增长一倍左右），比1958年增长39．3％。在这一千六百三十亿元的工业总产值中，生产资料占九百六十亿元，为1957年的290．9％；为1958年的143．3％；消费资料占六百七十亿元，为1957年的179．1％，为1958年的134％。农业方面的总产值，执行数字是七百八十三亿元，比1957年增长45．8％（第二个五年计划原定增长35％左右），比1958年增长16．7％。周总理在“关于调整1959年国民经济计划主要指标和进一步开展增产节约运动的报告”中指出：“按照社会主义国家经济建设发展的速度和我国第一个五年计划的建设经验来看，工业每年增产20％以上就是跃进，增产25％以上就是大跃进，增产30％以上就是特大跃进；农业每年增产10％以上就是跃进，增产15％以上就是大跃进，增产20％以上就是特大跃进”，那末，1958和1959年的事实在证明：我国的国民经济是不断地在大跃进的。
    我国的社会主义建设事业，为什么能够全面地以大跃进的速度向前发展呢？最根本的原因，是由于我国建立了社会主义制度。社会主义制度解决了资本主义社会所不能解决的生产力和生产关系的对抗性矛盾，解决了资本主义制度下生产资料同生产者之间完全分裂的矛盾。不论全民所有制和集体所有制，生产资料占有者和生产者都不是对立的，而是统一的。生产者就是生产资料的主人，生产的成果不再被少数剥削者所掠夺而归全社会的成员所有。阶级社会和剥削制度所给予生产力的局限性被否定了。生产资料的社会主义公有制，使人们有可能在生产过程中和在社会生活中，建立起同志般的、协作互助的相互关系。这种同志般的、协作互助的相互关系，明显地表现在社会主义竞赛中。在这里，先进者给予落后者以帮助，让落后者赶上以至超过自己，而自己则以更大的努力再超过那些超过自己的人。同时，生产资料的社会主义公有制使我们的国民收入的分配，有可能以有利于扩大社会主义再生产和有利于劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平的不断改善和提高来实现。这样，社会主义的生产关系就成为不断地推动社会生产力向前发展的一个重要方面了。社会主义制度的这种优越性是国民经济高速度发展的根据。当然，社会主义制度还是存在着矛盾的。在社会主义社会中，基本的矛盾仍然是生产关系和生产力之间的矛盾，上层建筑和经济基础之间的矛盾。可是，社会主义的矛盾同阶级社会，例如资本主义社会的矛盾，在性质上是根本不同的。社会主义社会的矛盾不是对抗性的矛盾，“它可以经过社会主义制度本身，不断地得到解决”。正是因为社会主义的生产关系和它的上层建筑能够按照需要，而不断地调整，不断地革新，这样，社会主义社会的生产力，就能够不断地高涨着；这样，国民经济高速度发展就成为社会主义经济的客观规律了。
    但是，社会主义的这种优越性是一种客观的东西，这种优越性能够发挥到什么程度，还要取决于人们的主观努力，还要取决于党的路线、政策的正确性。我国1956年经济战线上社会主义革命的伟大胜利，使我们在基本上解决了生产资料私有制的问题，在全国范围内基本上建立了社会主义的生产关系，这就为国民经济的高速度发展奠定了物质基础。1957年政治战线和思想战线上
  社会主义革命的伟大胜利，不但彻底地打垮了反党、反社会主义的资产阶级右派，深刻地改变了我国阶级力量的对比，而且在最广大的人民群众中形成了一个共产主义的思想大解放，掀起了为社会主义建设事业的革命干劲。就在这种形势之下，党中央和毛主席提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。社会主义建设总路线是党和毛泽东同志创造性地发展马克思列宁主义关于社会主义建设的普遍真理而提出来的，它充分发挥了人民群众的主观能动作用，把社会主义高速度发展的客观可能性，变为现实。
    党的社会主义建设总路线的本质是对人民群众在建设社会主义事业中的觉悟性、积极性、创造性的高度重视。因此，要求在社会主义建设的各个方面，大搞群众运动。鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的要求，就是号召六亿五千万人民在客观规律的范围内，充分发挥主观能动作用，要求在生产和建设中尽可能提高发展速度，充分发挥经济效果。在党领导下的群众运动，是把政治工作和经济工作结合起来的，是把对群众的政治教育和物质鼓励结合起来而以政治为统帅的。这样的群众运动就必然成为国民经济高速度发展的一种动力了。同时，党的总路线要求在社会主义建设中实行“两条腿走路”的方针，这样不但可以充分发挥群众的积极作用，而且可以避免片面性，避免只注意一个方面而忽视另一个方面，使各方面能够协调地、按比例发展。在国民经济中，最重要的比例关系是工业和农业、重工业和轻工业的比例关系，这两个最基本的比例关系安排好了，国民经济就能够高速度发展，而一套“两条腿走路”的方针，特别其中的工业和农业同时并举、重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针，恰恰为安排国民经济的基本比例关系指出了明确的方向。党的社会主义建设总路线集中地反映了社会主义高速度发展的客观规律，集中地反映了六亿五千万人民的雄心壮志，集中地反映了广大人民群众的最大利益和最迫切的要求。因此，很快就被群众所掌握而成为伟大的物质力量，进一步地提高了群众的社会主义觉悟，使他们的革命干劲和创造精神得到充分的发扬。我国社会主义事业的不断跃进，如果离开党的社会主义建设总路线，那是不可思议的。
    在大跃进中，我国的广大农村已经实现了人民公社化。人民公社的出现，反映了生产关系和上层建筑必须适合于生产力发展的要求，解决了高级农业合作社不能进一步适应生产力发展的矛盾。从而就促进了农业、促进了整个国民经济的大跃进。人民公社的最大优越性突出地表现在1959年战胜严重灾害的斗争中，表现在农、林、牧、副、渔各业的全面发展中，表现在社办工业的迅速发展中，还表现在公共食堂和集体福利事业中。人民公社使我们有可能更快地在农村实现农业现代化，从而就保证了农业生产的不断跃进。农业生产的全面跃进，为整个国民经济的大跃进提供了巨大的物质力量，它使轻工业得到更多的原料，使市场得到更丰富的物资。这都是人民公社促进整个国民经济继续大跃进的表现。不仅如此，人民公社还用自己的强大力量直接参加国民经济各个部门的事业，促进了这些事业的发展；它还需要日益增多的重工业产品来武装自己，从而就促进了重工业的不断地高速度前进。
    我们已经有了具有高速度发展的社会主义制度，又有党的总路线和人民公社，这就使我们的国民经济能够不断地、持续地向前跃进，使我们能够在今后三年中把原定的第二个五年计划指标大大提高，并且可以腾出手来，用较多的力量来加强国民经济中的薄弱环节，使我国社会主义建设能继续高速度地按比例地发展。
    经过1959年的继续大跃进，我国国民经济的又高速度、又按比例的跃进局面，已经完全奠定下来了。只要我们继续贯彻执行党的总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，我们就不但能够在1958和1959年连续大跃进的基础上，争取1960年的继续跃进，而且能够在今后的岁月中不断地保持国民经济的跃进和大跃进！
