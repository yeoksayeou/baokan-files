Six hundred thousand people braving the elements to build roads, fell trees and manufacture vehicles
    Jian Special District Transforms Mountainous Terrain into Thoroughfares
    Within a month, over 5,200 kilometers of roads were built, and over 80,000 vehicles of various types were manufactured. In mountainous areas where transportation was long blocked, now every commune has access to automobiles, every team has access to tractors, and in most areas, carrying loads by shoulder is eliminated.
    Nanchang Dispatch, January 20th. The Jian Special District of Jiangxi Province organized 600,000 people to build roads through mountains, cut down trees to make vehicles, and vigorously develop transportation construction. After a month of hard work, the entire district has achieved highway and vehicle access, completely changing the long-standing situation of transportation blockage in this mountainous area.
    According to statistics from December 20th last year, the entire special district constructed and renovated over 5,200 kilometers of roads in one month, equivalent to 2.3 times the total kilometers constructed and repaired in the nine years after liberation. Over 80,000 animal-drawn carts, large and small flatbed carts, and handcarts were built. Many narrow and winding paths in the mountains have been transformed into smooth roads and avenues. The "Yanzi Cliff" on the way from Suichuan to Jinggang Mountain, formerly a place "difficult for even rats to pass," now has a wide road for cars. Huangyangjie, one of the five major strategic passes of the Jinggang Mountain revolutionary base area era, has also opened up a new road. A new road was built on Dongguan Ridge in Yongxin County, more than 1,000 meters above sea level, and connected to the Jinggang Mountain road to Taihe County. Human shoulder-carrying transportation has been replaced by various vehicles in most areas. A comprehensive transportation network of automobiles accessible to every commune, and tractors and flatbed carts accessible to every team has been formed throughout the district.
    Jian Special District is a mountainous area with overlapping mountains and hills. Before liberation, except for a few hundred kilometers of the Nanchang-Ganzhou highway passing through the territory, most county towns in the entire district had no access to roads. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the entire district built many new roads, which strongly supported the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. However, according to the 1960 plan for the continued leap forward of industry and agriculture, the district's material transportation volume will increase sharply by about two times compared to 1959. To adapt to this new situation, the Jian District Committee of the Communist Party of China listed transportation construction together with water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and sideline production as the four major movements in the district this winter, and made unified arrangements.
    Because transportation construction centrally reflected the urgent demands of the broad masses, the people of the entire district displayed soaring revolutionary enthusiasm in transportation construction. They braved the elements, worked day and night, camped in the mountains, and worked hard and cleverly. When construction workers in Suichuan County had no foothold for construction on the cliffs, they used ropes to tie themselves up and hang them on trees to drill blasting holes. Five thousand women soldiers in Jishui County worked hard for five days and nights to construct more than 160 kilometers of roads. In transportation construction, the technical innovation movement has also been widely carried out. People in various places have successively created new tools and new construction methods such as local blasting methods, water-soaked soil methods, soil sliding methods, bamboo chutes, high-cable transportation, and four-wheeled bulldozers. Work efficiency has been increased by ten to nineteen times. Zhang Liangcai, a stonemason from Chuzhou Commune in Suichuan County, and others used old stone buckets to hold nitrate for blasting. One blast exploded more than 500 cubic meters of stone, which not only reduced labor intensity but also accelerated the progress of the project and ensured the quality of the project.
    In transportation construction, Party committees at all levels were led by the first secretary, and leaders personally went to the construction site to work alongside the workers, which not only encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses but also solved many problems in a timely manner.
    After the entire district achieved highway and vehicle access, there are many benefits to production and construction and people's lives. The main ones are: First, a large number of labor forces used in transportation are saved and put into agricultural production and diversified operations, comprehensively developing the mountainous economy. According to calculations in Suichuan County, the county can save more than 2.89 million transportation labor-days each year. Second, it opens up a path for the realization of agricultural modernization. Various modern agricultural machinery, water conservancy equipment, electrification construction materials, etc., can be continuously transported into mountainous and marginal areas through the comprehensive highway network. Third, it can quickly transport mountain materials to cities, industrial and mining areas in a timely manner to support industrial construction. Fourth, through the highway network, urban and rural material exchanges are further prospered, which can increase the income of commune members and improve people's lives. At the same time, the people in the mountainous areas have since been freed from the heavy shoulder-carrying transportation labor. It is truly "a winter of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness."

    六十万人风餐露宿劈山筑路伐木造车
    吉安专区丛山峻岭变通途
    一个月内修筑公路五千二百多公里，制成各种车子八万多辆。长期交通闭塞的山区，今日社社通汽车，队队通拖拉机，大部地区消灭肩挑人背
    本报南昌20日电　江西省吉安专区组织六十万人，劈山筑路，砍木造车，大搞交通建设。经历一个月奋战，全区实现了公路化、车子化，彻底改变了这个山区长期交通闭塞的局面。
    据去年12月20日的统计，全专区在一个月内，兴修整修公路达五千二百多公里，等于解放以后九年内兴修、补修公路总和的二点三倍。赶造畜力车、大小板车、手推车等八万余辆。许多丛山峻岭中的羊肠小路变成了平坦的公路和大道。遂川到井冈山途中的“燕子崖”，过去是个“老鼠难行”的地方，现在修起了宽敞的汽车路。井冈山革命老根据地时代的五大险要哨口之一——黄洋界上，也开辟了一条新公路。拔海一千多米的永新县东关岭新修了一条公路，并且接通了到泰和县的井冈山公路。绝大部分地区的人力肩挑运输已被各种车辆所代替。全区范围内，已经形成了社社通汽车、队队通拖拉机和板车的四通八达的交通运输网。
    吉安专区是个山川重叠、丘陵遍地的山区。解放前，除了南昌到赣州的公路干线有几百公里穿过境内外，全区绝大部分县城都无公路可通。解放后，特别是1958年大跃进以来，全区人民在党的领导下，兴修了许多新公路，有力地支援了工农业生产的大跃进。但是根据1960年工农业继续跃进的计划，全区物资运量将比1959年猛增二倍左右。为了适应这一新的形势，中共吉安地委把交通建设同水利、积肥、副业一起列为全区今冬的四大运动，并且作了统一安排。
    由于交通建设集中地反映了广大群众的迫切要求，全区人民在交通建设中就发挥了冲天的革命干劲。他们餐风沐雨，披星戴月，依山扎营，苦干巧干。遂川县修路群众在悬岩绝壁上施工没有立足点，就用绳索把自己绑起吊在树上打炮眼。吉水县五千名娘子军经过五昼夜奋战，兴修了一百六十多公里的公路。在交通建设中，技术革新运动也广泛地开展了起来。各地群众先后创造了土爆破法、放水湿土法、溜土法、竹滑道、高索运输、四轮推土器等新工具和新施工方法。提高工效十倍到十九倍，遂川县滁州公社石工张良才等用旧石桶装硝放炮，一炮就炸开石方五百多方，既减轻了劳动强度，又加快了工程进度，保证了工程质量。
    在交通建设中，各级党委都由第一书记挂帅，领导亲临工地，同民工一道劳动，既鼓舞了群众的干劲，又及时解决了许多问题。
    全区实现公路化、车子化以后，对生产建设和人民生活有许多好处。主要是：第一，节约了大批用在运输上的劳动力，投入农业生产和多种经营，全面开发山区经济。据遂川县计算，全县每年就可节约运输劳力二百八十九万多个。第二，为实现农业现代化开辟了道路。各种现代化的农业机械、水利器材、电气化建设材料等，都可通过四通八达的公路网，源源运入山区和边沿地区。第三，能够及时把山区物资迅速运往城市、工矿区，支援工业建设。第四，通过公路网，城乡物资交流进一步繁荣，可以增加社员收入，改善人民生活。同时，山区人民从此摆脱了笨重的肩挑运输劳动。真是“一冬辛苦，万年幸福”。
