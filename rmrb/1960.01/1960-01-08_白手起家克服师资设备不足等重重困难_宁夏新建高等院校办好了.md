Starting from Scratch and Overcoming Difficulties Such as Insufficient Teachers and Equipment
Newly Built Institutions of Higher Learning in Ningxia Have Been Successfully Established

(Our report) Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region established three institutions of higher learning during the Great Leap Forward in 1958: Ningxia Normal College, Ningxia Agricultural College, and Ningxia Medical College. After more than a year of development, consolidation, and improvement, they are now rapidly growing.

The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region previously had no institutions of higher learning. During the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, people of all ethnic groups urgently demanded the development of education. To meet the aspirations of all ethnic groups, the then Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, with the concern and strong support of the central government and all parts of the country, successively established Ningxia Medical College, Ningxia Agricultural College, and Ningxia Normal College in September, ending the history of no higher education in the Ningxia area.

These three institutions of higher learning were all established on the basis of three relevant secondary vocational schools. After the establishment of each college, they all started classes while building the school. The teachers came from all parts of the country. In addition to a few lecturers and professors, most were young teachers who had just graduated from institutions of higher learning. The students' levels were also uneven. Therefore, after the start of classes in each college, a few teachers were not at ease with their work, and some students thought that this was a "local university" with poor equipment, no professors or experts, and that they could not teach or learn well. In response to these ideological situations, the Party organizations of each college led teachers and students to launch free airing of views and debates, criticized various right-leaning conservative ideas in running the school, and conducted ideological education on "running the school diligently and thriftily," "struggling hard," and "striving for advancement," enabling everyone to be full of energy and solve the various difficulties and problems encountered in the process of building the school.

The shortage of teachers, the large number of new teachers, and the lack of teaching experience were the first and most prominent problems encountered in the construction of these institutions of higher learning. In response to this situation, each college, in the spirit of self-reliance, took various measures to actively cultivate and improve the teaching staff. In addition to sending a small number of young teachers to fraternal institutions in other places for short-term training, they also grasped the on-the-job spare-time training of teachers. They established teaching and research groups according to the majors or subjects offered, organized new and old teachers to participate, and conducted regular business policy study discussions to exchange teaching experiences. The new teachers also adopted the method of collective lesson preparation, worked with the old teachers to study and discuss the drafting of lectures or pre-lectures, and conducted teaching demonstrations and listened to special lectures by the old teachers. Many new teachers also attended classes with students to further improve their professional knowledge. In this way, teaching, learning, and revising at the same time rapidly improved the teaching level and teaching ability. Many young teachers who had just left school took on first- and second-year courses this semester, and the quality of teaching was also gradually improved.

In order to better implement the Party's education policy, all colleges closely integrated teaching with productive labor. In the past year or so, in addition to actively participating in the Great Steel Smelting Campaign and participating in labor in rural areas and factories during vacations, teachers and students of all colleges have generally established on-campus production bases and listed productive labor as a formal course. The Normal College and the Agricultural College have established on-campus farms and factories, and organized teachers and students to participate in labor regularly. Through productive labor, not only have the vast number of teachers and students learned practical production knowledge, but their class viewpoints and mass viewpoints have been greatly enhanced. Students are diligent and eager to learn, love labor, teachers are at ease with their work, teach conscientiously, and teachers and students unite and help each other, love the collective, abide by discipline, and strive for advancement, which has become the general atmosphere of each college.

Insufficient equipment and poor teaching conditions are also difficulties existing in these schools. However, under the leadership of the Party organization, the teachers and students of each college resolutely implemented the principle of diligence and thrift in running the school and overcame these difficulties. In order to catch up with advanced fraternal colleges as soon as possible, the teachers and students of Ningxia Agricultural College, while doing a good job in teaching, participated in school construction and built one teaching farm, one ranch, and two factories in two months, ensuring the needs of on-site teaching. Since the establishment of Ningxia Medical College, under the guidance of a few technicians, students and teachers have worked together to make adobe bricks, do carpentry work, and built more than 80 houses, solving the problem of some classrooms, laboratories, and dormitory rooms, saving the country more than 50,000 yuan in capital construction investment. The laboratories, reference rooms, libraries, and various labor practice equipment of these schools have also been gradually established, and the teaching conditions are getting better and better. Ningxia Medical College has opened 15 courses and established 12 laboratories. The library of Ningxia Normal College has a collection of more than 100,000 books of various kinds and more than 4,000 reference materials.

Under the leadership of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and relevant departments, the Party organizations of these three institutions of higher learning have been further improved, and the administrative leadership has been strengthened. (Huang Jing)

    白手起家克服师资设备不足等重重困难
    宁夏新建高等院校办好了
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区在1958年大跃进中，创办的宁夏师范学院、宁夏农学院和宁夏医学院三座高等院校，经过一年多的发展、整顿和提高，现在都迅速地成长起来。
    宁夏回族自治区原来没有高等学校，1958年工农业生产大跃进中，各族人民迫切要求发展教育事业，为了满足各族人民的愿望，当时自治区筹备委员会，在中央和全国各地的关怀与大力支援下，就相继在9月间办起了宁夏医学院、宁夏农学院和宁夏师范学院，结束了宁夏地区没有高等学校的历史。
    这三座高等院校，都是在三个有关中等专业学校的基础上成立的。各学院成立以后，都是边开课、边建校。学校的教师来自全国各个地区，除了少数讲师和教授外，大部分都是刚从高等院校毕业不久的青年教师。学生的程度也参差不齐。因此，各院校开学以后，有少数教师就不安心工作，有些学生认为这是“土大学”，设备差，没有教授专家，教不好，学不好。各院校的党组织针对这些思想情况，领导师生展开鸣放辩论，批驳了在办学上的种种右倾保守思想，进行了“勤俭办学”“艰苦奋斗”和“力争上游”的思想教育，使大家鼓足了干劲，解决了在建校过程中遇到的种种困难和问题。
    教师数量不足，新教师多，缺乏教学经验，是这些高等院校建校过程中首先遇到的一个比较突出的问题。各院校针对这个情况，本着自力更生的精神，采取了种种措施，积极培养提高师资。他们除选派少数青年教师到外地兄弟院校短期进修外，还抓紧了教师的在职业余进修。按照所开专业或课目成立了教研组，组织新老教师参加，进行定期的业务政策学习讨论，交流教学经验。新教师们还采取了集体备课的方法，和老教师一起研究讨论拟定讲稿或预先试讲，并进行教学观摩，和听取老教师的专题讲学。许多新教师还和学生一起听课，进一步提高专业知识。这样边教边学边改，迅速提高了教学水平和教学能力，许多刚出学校的青年教师，这学期都担任了一二年级的课程，教学质量也逐步提高。
    为了更好地贯彻党的教育方针，各院校都把教学和生产劳动紧密地结合起来。一年多来，各院校师生除了积极参加大炼钢铁，利用假期下乡下厂参加劳动外，都普遍建立了校内生产基地，把生产劳动列为正式课程。师范学院和农学院都建立了校内的农场和工厂，组织师生定期参加劳动。通过生产劳动，不但使广大师生学到了实际生产知识，而且他们的阶级观点、群众观点都大为增强，学生勤奋好学，热爱劳动，教师安心工作，认真教学，师生团结互助，爱集体、守纪律、求上进，已成为各院校的普遍风气。
    设备不足，教学条件差，也是这些学校存在的困难。但各院校师生在党组织的领导下，坚决贯彻了勤俭办学的原则，克服了这些困难。宁夏农学院为了尽快地赶上先进兄弟院校，师生们一边搞好教学，一边参加建校，在两个月内就建起了教学农场、牧场各一处和工厂两处，保证了现场教学的需要。宁夏医学院建校以来，在少数技工的指导下，学生和教师一起动手，打土坯、作木活，盖起了八十多间房舍，解决了部分教室、实验室和宿舍的用房，给国家节约基建投资五万多元。这些学校的实验室、资料室、图书馆及各种劳动实习设备，也都逐渐建立起来了，教学条件越来越好。宁夏医学院开了十五门课，就建立了十二个实验室。宁夏师范学院图书馆已藏各类书籍十万余册，还有四千多份参考资料。
    在中共宁夏回族自治区委员会及有关部门的领导下，最近这三座高等院校都进一步健全了党的组织，加强了行政领导。　（黄静）
