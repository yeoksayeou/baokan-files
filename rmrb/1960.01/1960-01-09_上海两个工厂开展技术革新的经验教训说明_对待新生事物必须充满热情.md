Shanghai's Two Factories' Experiences and Lessons in Technical Innovation Show:
	One Must Be Enthusiastic Towards New Things
	(Our report) Two factories in Shanghai, formerly known nationwide for their large-scale use of indigenous machine tools, saw differing developments in their technical innovation movements, and differing results in completing their plans in 1959. This was due to differences in the leading cadres' understanding of the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and differences in their attitudes towards mass movements.
	One of these factories was the Construction Machinery Factory. In 1959, it greatly developed the experience of large-scale technical innovation from 1958. The movement was vigorous, production rose rapidly, and the annual plan was completed ahead of schedule. It was recognized as an advanced collective attending the National "Meeting of Heroes." The other was the Jingye Machinery Factory. Although it was also originally an advanced factory, and the masses had high production enthusiasm, and production increased significantly compared to 1958, the technical innovation movement stagnated at one point, and production declined at one point, affecting the completion of the annual task.
	Both factories became known throughout the country in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 for using indigenous machine tools to produce heavy machinery such as rolling mills and converters. However, by the second quarter of 1959, the gap in development between the two factories was significant. The leading cadres and masses of the Construction Machinery Factory, based on their experience in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, deeply felt that indigenous machine tools had the advantages of simple structure, easy manufacturing, light weight, low cost, and flexible and convenient use. Manufacturing and using indigenous machine tools was a good way to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results under the existing material conditions. Therefore, in 1959, they continued to adhere to the principle of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods, greatly developed the experience of "ants gnawing at bones," and undertook more arduous and complex tasks than in 1958, such as manufacturing rolling mills, fertilizer equipment, and smelting equipment. The factory's production was higher each quarter in 1959. By November 13th, it had completed the annual output value plan forty-eight days ahead of schedule. The total weight of products completed throughout the year was several times greater than in 1958, and every product leaving the factory was qualified. Labor productivity increased by more than 58% compared to 1958, achieving the effect of one person equaling one and a half people.
	In the Jingye Machinery Factory, the situation was different.
	In the first quarter of 1959, the mass movement was still vigorous, and indigenous machine tools were still exerting great power. Some indigenous machine tools even had new developments. But when a small cold wave blew in the second quarter, the factory was not so lively. This was because some leading cadres in the factory did not see the enormous creative talent of the workers, looked down on indigenous machine tools, and disregarded the fact that the factory's workers had used indigenous machine tools to process qualified rolling mill mainframes, insisting that the quality of products processed by indigenous machine tools was not good. During this period, not only did the factory not increase new indigenous machine tools, but some indigenous machine tools that could have been continued to be used or slightly improved were moved into the warehouse. As a result, production declined, and the output value completed each month in May and June decreased by 22% to 32% compared to March. Although production rebounded rapidly after the Party Central Committee issued the call to "oppose rightism and boost morale" in August, it was quite difficult to catch up because of the large amount of work that was behind. The higher-level competent department had to transfer eighty-odd people from other factories to support them.
	Because the leading cadres of the two factories had different understandings of the principle of walking on two legs, their attitudes towards vigorously launching mass movements and vigorously carrying out technical innovation were also different. The party branch and administrative leaders of the Construction Machinery Factory sincerely relied on the masses, enthusiastically supported the masses, and mobilized the masses in a thorough and meticulous manner; leaders and the masses promoted each other. The state asked them to complete the mainframes of two sets of 630mm medium-sized rolling mills in the first half of the year, which was much more complex and arduous than the large converter parts processed in 1958, and the time requirement was very urgent. As a result, the task of completing the mainframes of two sets of medium-sized rolling mills was completed ahead of schedule.
	However, the attitude of some leading cadres of the Jingye Machinery Factory towards the mass movement was different. At the end of the first quarter, the factory party committee called on all employees to continue to vigorously carry out technical innovation and vigorously develop indigenous machine tools to complete the 1959 task. The masses were very enthusiastic and put forward more than twenty innovation proposals in one night. However, without enthusiastically supporting the masses, all twenty-odd proposals were rejected, which resulted in everyone being discouraged.
	The Party Central Committee's call to "oppose rightism and boost morale" in August greatly supported and encouraged the employees of the Jingye Machinery Factory, and the enthusiasm of the masses soared. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and relevant district party committees, production rebounded rapidly, and the indigenous machine tools that had been moved into the warehouse were moved out again and used in the workshop. The party committee led the employees to do everything possible to strive to complete the annual task, and all employees worked hard to make progress and vigorously carried out technical innovation. Finally, the 1959 output value state plan was completed one day ahead of schedule on December 30.

    上海两个工厂开展技术革新的经验教训说明
    对待新生事物必须充满热情
    本报讯　上海有两个原来以大搞土机床而齐名全国的工厂，1959年由于领导干部对土洋并举方针的认识不同，对群众运动的态度不同，技术革新运动的发展一快一慢，完成计划一好一差。
    这两个工厂一个是建设机器厂，1959年大大发展了1958年大搞技术革新的经验，运动轰轰烈烈，生产迅速上升，年度计划提前完成，被评为出席全国“群英会”的先进集体。另一个是精业机器厂，虽然原来也是先进厂，群众的生产积极性很高，生产比1958年有较大增长，但是技术革新运动一度停滞不前，生产一度下降，完成全年任务受到影响。
    这两个厂都是在1958年大跃进中，因为用土机床生产出轧钢机、转炉等重型机械而闻名全国的。可是，到1959年第二季度，这两个厂发展的差距就很大了。建设机器厂的领导干部和群众根据1958年大跃进的经验，深深感到土机床具有结构简单、制造容易、重量轻、成本低、使用起来灵活方便等优点，制造和使用土机床是在现有物质条件下实现多快好省的好办法。因此，他们1959年继续本着自力更生的精神，坚持土洋并举的方针，大大发展了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的经验，担当起了比1958年更繁重更复杂的制造轧钢机、化肥设备、冶炼设备等任务。这个厂1959年的生产一季比一季高，到11月13日为止提前四十八天完成了全年产值计划，全年完成的产品重量比1958年要多几倍，出厂的产品，台台合格。劳动生产率比1958年提高了58％以上，实现了一人抵一个半人。
    在精业机器厂里，却是另外一番景象。
    1959年第一季度，群众运动还轰轰烈烈，土机床还在发挥着巨大的威力；有的土机床还有了新的发展。但是当第二季度刮起小股冷风的时候，厂里就不那么热闹了。这与这个厂的个别领导干部看不到工人群众巨大的创造才能，看不起土机床，不顾本厂工人用土机床合格地加工出轧钢机主机的事实，硬说土机床加工的产品质量不好。这一时期，厂里不但没有增加新的土机床，本来可以继续使用或稍加改进即可继续使用的土机床，有些也被搬进了仓库。于是生产下降，5、6月份每个月完成的产值，比3月份下降了22％到32％。虽然8月份党中央发出“反右倾、鼓干劲”的号召以后，生产迅速回升，但是因为前一时期欠账太多，赶起来相当吃力。上级主管部门不得不从别的工厂调去八十几人支援他们。
    由于两个厂领导干部对两条腿走路的方针认识不同，所以对大搞群众运动、大闹技术革新的态度也就两样了。建设机器厂的党支部和行政领导，真心诚意地依靠群众，满腔热情地支持群众，深入细致地发动群众；领导和群众互相促进。国家要他们上半年完成两套六百三十毫米中型轧钢机的主机，这比1958年加工的转炉大部件要复杂繁重得多，而且时间要求很急迫。结果是提前完成了两套中型轧钢机的主机任务。
    但是，精业机器厂的个别领导干部，对待群众运动却是另外一种态度。第一季度末，厂党委号召全厂职工继续大闹技术革新、大搞土机床，完成1959年任务。群众热情很高，一个晚上就提出二十几条革新建议。但是，没有热情地支持群众，把二十几条建议全部否定了，结果大家泄气了。
    去年8月份党中央发出“反右倾、鼓干劲”的号召，大大支持和鼓舞了精业机器厂的职工群众，群众热情高涨。在中共上海市委和有关区委的领导下，生产迅速回升，进仓库的土机床又搬出来在车间里使用了。党委领导职工群众千方百计地力争完成全年任务，全厂职工发奋图强，大搞技术革新。终于，1959年产值国家计划在12月30日提前一天完成。
