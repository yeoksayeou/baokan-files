Xinhua News Agency, January 24th, Johannesburg dispatch: The South African Congress of Trade Unions recently issued a statement on the issue of establishing an All-African Federation of Trade Unions, saying that the establishment of an All-African Federation of Trade Unions would be an important contribution to the African people's struggle for freedom and a step towards the solidarity of the international working class. Last November, representatives of trade unions from all over Africa held a meeting in Accra, the capital of Ghana, calling for the establishment of an All-African Federation of Trade Unions. The meeting decided to convene a congress of African trade unions in Casablanca, Morocco, in May of this year to formulate the details of the establishment of the All-African Federation of Trade Unions.

In its statement on the importance of establishing an All-African Federation of Trade Unions, the South African Congress of Trade Unions analyzed the reasons for the continuous decrease in the number of African trade unions participating in the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions". It said that this was because the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" violated the trend of the African continent's struggle for independence and the principles of the All-African Peoples' Conference. The South African Congress of Trade Unions also pointed out that the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" supported the establishment of the only pro-apartheid "South African Federation of Free Trade Unions" in the Union of South Africa last year, attempting to split the South African trade union movement, and also threatened to destroy the South African Congress of Trade Unions.

In its statement, the South African Congress of Trade Unions expressed its hope that the Casablanca conference to be held in May would become a new high point in the solidarity of all African workers.

    南非工会大会发表声明指出
    成立全非工会有利于国际工人阶级团结
    新华社24日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非工会大会——最近就建立全非工会联合会问题发表声明说，成立全非工会联合会将是对非洲人民争取自由的斗争的一个重要贡献，是走向国际工人阶级团结的一个步骤。去年11月，非洲各地工会代表在加纳首都阿克拉举行的会议，号召成立全非工会联合会。会议决定，今年5月在摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡召开非洲各工会的代表大会，拟定成立全非工会联合会的细节。
    南非工会大会在声明中谈到成立全非工会联合会的重要性时，分析了非洲工会参加“国际自由工会联合会”的数目不断减少的原因。它说，这是由于“国际自由工会联合会”违反了非洲大陆争取独立的趋势和非洲人民大会的原则。南非工会大会还指出，“国际自由工会联合会”去年在南非联邦支持成立唯一主张种族隔离的“南非自由工会”，企图分裂南非工会运动，并且还扬言要摧毁南非工会大会。
    南非工会大会在声明中表示，期望在5月召开的卡萨布兰卡会议成为全非洲工人团结的新高潮。
