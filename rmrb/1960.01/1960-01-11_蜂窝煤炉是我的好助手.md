    The Honeycomb Coal Stove is My Good Helper
    Chen Xiuzhen, Resident of Gan Jing Hutong, Qianmenwai, Beijing
    In the summer of 1956, because I was doing street work, I often visited my neighbors. My neighbors advised me to switch to using a honeycomb coal stove, saying it would save trouble and money. I thought to myself, "I'm an old Beijinger, and I've been using coal briquette stoves for decades. Sometimes I can't even guarantee a timely meal. If I switch to burning honeycomb coal, it might be even more unreliable!"
    As time went by, there were more and more things to do, and tending the stove became a burden. Especially when meetings ran long, or I added too little coal before leaving, the fire would go out when I got back, and my school-aged children would have to eat cold buns. It was heartbreaking to see. That's when I finally decided to break the decades-old habit of burning coal briquettes and try burning honeycomb coal.
    I bought a honeycomb coal stove. At first, I was still a little worried, afraid that the honeycomb coal fire would be too weak for steaming buns and corn cakes. I did an experiment on the first day, using the same large iron pot I always used to steam a pot of corn cakes. The result was quite good. This put my mind at ease.
    Soon, I started working, and to make sure that my children and husband could eat on time, my third daughter and I cooperated. Every day, she would go home first and open the stove door to keep the fire going. By the time I got home, the flames were strong, and the water in the kettle on the stove was boiling. We managed to avoid any delays. What I remember most is that in 1957, I had twins again. I didn't have enough milk, and I needed to make formula in the middle of the night, so I relied entirely on the honeycomb coal stove. If I had been using a coal briquette stove, I don't know how much more exhausted I would have been!
    Burning honeycomb coal really saves coal, firewood, money, and trouble. In the past, my family used to burn three to four hundred catties of coal briquettes and more than thirty catties of firewood every month. Now, just seventy or eighty five-inch honeycomb coals are enough, saving about one yuan a month. The house is also cleaner than when we used to burn coal briquette stoves. In the past, every time coal was delivered, there would be a big, black pile. Now, the honeycomb coal is stacked neatly and is very clean. The days of thick smoke billowing and ashes flying all over the yard every morning when burning coal briquettes are gone forever. If someone were to ask me now how it is to burn honeycomb coal, I can only say: Honeycomb coal has reduced my housework and is my good helper.

### 蜂窝煤炉是我的好助手

    蜂窝煤炉是我的好助手
    北京前门外甘井胡同居民　陈秀珍
    1956年的夏天，因为我做街道工作，经常到邻居家串门。邻居劝我改个蜂窝煤炉子用用，说是可以省事省钱。我心里想，“自己是老北京，弄了几十年煤球炉子，有时候还保不住误饭，如果改烧蜂窝煤恐怕就更不保险了！”
    时间一天天过去，事儿越来越多，弄炉子就成了负担。特别是开会的时间长了一点，去时煤添少了点，回来火就灭了，上学的孩子只能啃凉馒头，看着心里怪难受。这时才下决心打破几十年来烧煤的老规矩，尝试改烧蜂窝煤了。
    我买来了一只蜂窝煤炉。起先，还有点不放心，怕蜂窝煤火头软，蒸馒头、窝窝头不行。头天做了个试验，用原来使的一口大铁锅，蒸了一锅窝窝头，结果蒸的挺好。这样，心上的石头就落了地。
    不久我参加了工作，为了让孩子和爱人按时吃饭，就和三女儿合作；每天由她先回家拉开炉门养火，等我到家时，火苗旺了，炉上铁壶的水也烧开了。做好饭，正好孩子放学，爱人下班，做到了三不误。更使我难忘的是1957年我又添了一对双胎儿，奶不够，半夜里要冲点奶粉，又全靠蜂窝煤炉了。要是烧煤球炉，不知该受多少累哩！
    烧蜂窝煤真是省煤、省柴、省钱、省事。过去我家每月总得烧三、四百斤煤球，三十多斤劈柴。现在只要烧五吋的蜂窝煤七、八十块就够了，一个月能节约一元左右。屋子也比过去烧煤球炉时干净了，过去一送煤，就是乌黑的一大摊，现在蜂窝煤堆得整整齐齐，干净得很。烧煤球时每天早晨满院子那种浓烟滚滚、炉灰飞扬的日子再也看不见了。要是现在有人再问我，烧蜂窝煤怎样，我只能说：蜂窝煤减轻了我的家务劳动，是我的好助手。
