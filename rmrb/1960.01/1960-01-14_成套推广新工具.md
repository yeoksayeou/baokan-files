　　Complete Set of New Tools for Promotion

　　Plastering is one of the five major trades in the construction industry, along with bricklaying, steel reinforcement, concrete work, and hoisting. The labor used for plastering in the construction of a building accounts for about one-fifth of the total labor force. In the past, because plastering was a complicated manual operation, efficiency improved relatively slowly. Especially when other trades were constantly breaking through quotas, plastering became a weak link.

　　How to break through this weak link and speed up construction? This requires implementing a "walking on two legs" approach: one is to build prefabricated component factories, use machinery to produce large wall panels, and then assemble them on the construction site. This is one direction of development for the construction industry. The other is to improve plastering tools, transforming complex operations into simple ones, and clumsy tools into lightweight ones, thereby increasing plastering efficiency. The latter method requires less money and yields faster results, and can have an immediate effect in resolving the contradiction between the efficiency of the plastering trade and that of other trades.

　　Since the Great Leap Forward, plasterers across the country have created many new plastering tools during the technical innovation movement. On this basis, there is a need to promptly conduct systematic summarization and matching into complete sets. If only a few processes or operations of a trade use advanced tools, while other aspects have not been improved accordingly, the labor productivity of the entire trade cannot be greatly improved. Because the plasterers at the Beijing Teaching Instrument Factory construction site assembled their plastering tools into complete sets, the efficiency of plastering was significantly improved. We are now introducing their creations to construction workers in various regions, hoping that everyone will promote this set of tools according to their specific circumstances, and more importantly, that everyone will pay attention to doing a good job in the matching and complete promotion of new machinery and tools, so that plastering and other trades in various regions can use complete sets of advanced tools, and make them continuously improve.

### 成套推广新工具

    成套推广新工具
    抹灰，是建筑业中同砌砖、钢筋、混凝土、吊装并列的五大工种之一。建设一幢楼房，用在抹灰上的劳动力，相当于全部劳动力的五分之一左右。过去由于抹灰工种是繁琐的手工操作，效率提高得比较缓慢。尤其当其他工种都在不断突破定额的时候，抹灰工种便成了一个薄弱环节。
    怎样突破这个薄弱环节，加快建设速度呢？这要实行“两条腿走路”的办法：其一是兴建预制构件厂，用机械生产大型壁板，然后在工地上进行装配。这是建筑业发展的方向之一。其二是改良抹灰工具，把繁琐的操作变为简单的操作，把笨拙的工具改为轻巧的工具，提高抹灰效率。后一种办法花钱少、收效快，对于解决当前抹灰工种同其他工种效率不相适应的矛盾能收立竿见影之效。
    大跃进以来，全国抹灰工人在技术革新运动中已经创造了不少新的抹灰工具。在这个基础上，需要及时作一番系统总结、配搭成套的工作。一个工种如果只有几个工序或几项操作改用了先进工具，而其他方面没有作相应的改进，整个工种的劳动生产率也不能大大提高。北京教学仪器厂工地的抹灰工人因为把抹灰工具配成了套，结果抹灰效率显著提高。我们现在向各地建筑工人介绍他们的创造，既希望大家根据各自的具体情况推广这套工具，更希望大家都注意作好新机具的配套工作和成套推广工作，使各地抹灰等工种都用上成套的先进工具，并使它们不断趋于完善。
