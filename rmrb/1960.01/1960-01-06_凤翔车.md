The Tianjin No. 3 Steel Rolling Plant recently created a "Phoenix Flight Vehicle." This vehicle has a simple structure, with a head like a chicken's beak. Using leverage, the "chicken beak" can open and close vertically, flexibly loading and unloading materials. The long handle is the fulcrum of the lever, making it easy to operate. Two ordinary wheels are also installed underneath the vehicle, making it light to push. Previously, more than 400 catties of steel ingots had to be lifted by four people. Now, one person can push the "Phoenix Flight Vehicle," lift the handle, and pick up the steel ingot like a rooster pecking at food and walk away. Lift the handle again, and the steel ingot is placed stably on the ground, quickly, safely, and easily.

The transport workers at the No. 3 Steel Rolling Plant are very fond of this vehicle. The designer of this vehicle is Yang Enhe, a Communist Party member and maintenance worker. This vehicle looks like a beautiful rooster and resembles a phoenix in a painting, so the workers affectionately call it the "Phoenix Flight Vehicle."

    “凤翔车”
    天津市轧钢三厂最近创制了一种“凤翔车”。这种车子结构简单，车头像个鸡嘴，利用杠杆作用，
  “鸡嘴”能够上下张合，灵活地装卸物资。长长的把手是杠杆的力点，操纵起来很省劲。车下面还装有两个普通的车轮子，推起来轻便。以前，四百多斤的钢锭得用四个人抬，现在，一个人推着“凤翔车”，一抬把手，就像公鸡啄食似的把钢锭叼起就走；再一抬把手，钢锭又平稳地放在地上，又快、又安全、又轻巧。
    轧钢三厂的搬运工人十分喜爱这种车子。这种车子的设计者是共产党员、保全工人杨恩贺。这台车子既像美丽的公鸡，又似画中的凤凰，工人们就亲切地称它为“凤翔车”。
