Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 23rd: "Red Right" newspaper today published excerpts from the speech made by Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, at the Central Committee Plenary Session held on January 13th and 14th. In his report, he discussed the issue of re-demarcating administrative divisions.

When evaluating the proposals for re-demarcating administrative divisions that were discussed nationwide at the end of last year, Novotný emphasized that it was a correct method for the Central Committee to consult with party members and the broad masses before making a final decision on these fundamental issues related to the entire society. The discussion process confirmed the high political consciousness of the Czechoslovak people and their sense of responsibility for building a socialist society. It demonstrated the working people's trust in the Communist Party and their willingness to play the most effective role in participating in the management of society and the state.

Speaking about the economic development in 1959, Novotný said that industry completed the plan by 101.9%, and industrial output increased by nearly 11% compared to 1958. The Second Five-Year Plan stipulated an increase of 54% in industrial output, but in the first four years up to 1959, it had already increased by 49%. Therefore, in 1960, industrial output will increase by 64% compared to 1955.

Novotný then spoke about agriculture. He pointed out that in the process of socialist transformation of agriculture, agricultural production has continued to grow, which is not only reflected in absolute figures, but mainly in the output per capita. He emphasized that developing agricultural production will be the main task of Czechoslovakia in the next stage. He also said that socialist society must firmly establish itself in both industry and agriculture.

Novotný said that the Czechoslovak Republic is strong. Its role and prestige in the world are growing. He emphasized that the achievement of these great successes is based on the unbreakable alliance and fraternal cooperation with the Soviet Union, where Soviet assistance is of great significance.

Novotný concluded by saying that we are now and will remain a firm member of the united socialist family. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia will continue to conduct all its activities in accordance with the principles of proletarian internationalism and the principles of Marxist-Leninist theory.

    捷五年工业总产值计划将超额完成

    新华社布拉格23日电　“红色权利报”今天刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼在1月13日和14日举行的中央全会上讲话的摘要。他在报告中谈到了重新划定行政区划的问题。
    诺沃提尼在评价去年年底全民讨论重新划定行政区划问题的建议时着重指出，中央委员会在对这些关系到整个社会的根本性问题作出最后决定以前同党员和广大群众商量，是一个正确的方法。讨论的过程证实了捷克斯洛伐克人民的高度政治觉悟以及他们对于建设社会主义社会的责任感。它证明了劳动人民对共产党的信任以及他们发挥最有效的作用来参加社会和国家的管理的意愿。
    在谈到1959年的经济发展情况时，诺沃提尼说，工业以101．9％完成了计划，工业产值比1958年增加了将近11％。第二个五年计划规定工业产值增长54％，可是在到1959年为止的头四年中就已经增长了49％，因此1960年工业产值将比1955年增长64％。
    诺沃提尼接着谈到了农业。他指出，在农业社会主义化的过程中，农业生产不断增长，这不仅表现在绝对数字上，而且主要表现在按人口平均计算的产量上。他着重指出，发展农业生产将是捷克斯洛伐克在下一个阶段的主要任务。他并且说，社会主义社会必须在工业和农业这两方面坚定不移地站稳脚跟。
    诺沃提尼说，捷克斯洛伐克共和国是强盛的。它在世界上所起的作用和所享有的威信日益增长。他着重说，这些巨大成就的取得是以同苏联的牢不可破的同盟和友谊以兄弟般的合作为基础的，在这里，苏联的援助具有重大的意义。
    诺沃提尼最后说，我们现在是，将来仍然是团结一致的社会主义国家大家庭中坚定的一员。捷克斯洛伐克共产党将继续根据无产阶级国际主义的原则、马克思列宁主义理论的原则进行它的全部活动。
