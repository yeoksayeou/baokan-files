An Extraordinary Year
Luo Shiqiu, Secretary of the General Branch of the Jin’gang Commune Linwan Brigade, Changde, Hunan

The year of the Great Leap Forward, 1959, has passed, and it was truly an extraordinary year. The Party's General Line for Socialist Construction has brought us one victory after another. Taking our Linwan Brigade of the Jin’gang Commune in Changde as an example, after resolutely implementing the General Line, the masses' ideological awareness greatly improved, and production was a complete success. Last year, under the threat of a 125-day drought, our brigade, through arduous struggle, rescued all the seedlings, and the average annual grain yield per mu reached 945 jin, an increase of more than 90% compared to the previous year. This was something the commune members never dreamed of. Recently, the Production Inspection Team of the Changde Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China came to our brigade to inspect production, help us summarize the production achievements of the past year, and celebrate the great agricultural harvest with us. The commune members are all filled with joy, and lanterns and decorations are everywhere. Chen Guangyao, a 67-year-old poor peasant commune member, is more energetic than ever. He insists on collecting more than 200 jin of wild manure every day, and rarely rests even in rainy weather. Recently, the commune, in order to help him solve some difficulties in getting through the winter, gave this old man cotton quilts and cotton clothes, and told him that the team is conducting year-end accounting and he can still get dozens of yuan in wages. He was very touched by the Party and commune's concern for him. He often tells others with a smile: "I am almost seventy years old, and I have never seen such a big drought, yet we can still harvest so much grain. Only the People's Commune can do this. My body is still strong, and I want to do my best for the commune!" There are many more people in our brigade who are as enthusiastic about production as he is.

Last year was a victory, but this victory was not easily achieved. The spirit of the General Line overcame many right-leaning conservative ideological sentiments. This includes myself.

In early February of last year, the Commune Party Committee convened a meeting of the General Branch Secretaries of the brigades, deciding to carry out production competitions based on brigades. Our Linwan Brigade's competitor was the neighboring Wanwan Brigade. At first, I had many fears and difficulties. Our brigade is a hilly area with the poorest soil in the commune, and the water source is not good, and the labor burden is heavy. The Wanwan Brigade is not like this; they are in a plain area with good soil, oily sandy soil, and pig liver mud fields. Their labor burden is also light, and the average amount of land burdened by each person is relatively small. I thought our conditions were too poor to catch up with the Wanwan Brigade, so we could not compete with them. I once went to the Commune Party Committee to explain the difficulties. The Party Committee helped me in a timely manner, saying that if I did not let go of my ideological baggage, I would not be able to strive for the upper reaches and complete the Party's tasks; and asked me to consider: can conditions be created? How can conditions be created? Especially think about it in light of the spirit of the General Line. After returning home, I seriously considered the words of the Party Committee, and seriously thought about the spirit of the Party's General Line, and my mind became much clearer! I slowly figured it out. In order to widely mobilize the masses, I boldly proposed a production competition to the Wanwan Brigade. At a mass meeting attended by 1,700 people, I frankly told the masses about the incorrect thoughts mentioned above and the process of overcoming them, explaining that as long as we seriously consider problems in accordance with the spirit of the General Line, we will be motivated. The masses thought that the meeting was effective, and those who had the same concerns as me also let go of their ideological baggage and were determined to compete with the Wanwan Brigade. In this way, after our enthusiasm was aroused, we immediately took action.

First of all, we closely grasped the seasonality of production, and every agricultural activity was carried out as early as possible. Old farmers often say: "Hold the hoe firmly, and the season is fundamental." After that mass meeting, our manure accumulation and plowing movement began with gongs and drums. In just a few days, manure accumulation reached more than 900 dan per mu. On March 15th, our rice seedlings were planted, five days ahead of the date stipulated by the Commune Party Committee; transplanting was also ten days earlier than the Wanwan Brigade. Next, we vigorously carried out soil improvement work. In early April, Li Xinge, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, came to our brigade to inspect production. As soon as he met me, he said, "Old Luo, when I come here, I want to see if there have been any changes in your Gongjiaping." The Party Committee's eyes are so sharp! Gongjiaping is the area with the poorest soil in our brigade. In the past, regardless of whether the year was good or bad, only a few grains of rice could be harvested there. We focused on improving the soil in Gongjiaping. Due to the vigorous soil improvement work, the seedlings were completely different from previous years and grew green in a row. Gongjiaping is not the Gongjiaping of the past.

Our seedlings were transplanted early, and the early rice harvest was eight or nine days earlier than the Wanwan Brigade, and the late rice was transplanted in advance. At this time, the drought began, so we devoted all our efforts to drought resistance. Our slogan was to get grain from the big river and reap a bumper harvest from the ditches and harbors. In two days and two nights, we built more than 1,600 meters of aqueducts and dug a 2,600-meter-long canal. We fought for more than 120 days of drought, and we fought for more than 120 days, and finally we were victorious.

Recently, our brigade has formulated a production plan for 1960. All of the team's more than 4,000 mu of paddy fields will be planted with double-cropping rice, and the total grain output will be greatly increased compared to 1959. From now on, the brigade plans to establish a 1,000-head pig farm, producing 5,000 pigs annually. This year, we will also open up 400 mu of vegetable bases, striving for an income of 2,500 yuan per mu. After these plans were discussed by the masses, they unanimously expressed their approval and were determined to realize the plan with practical actions. At present, more than 89,000 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed in terms of water conservancy, basically realizing self-flowing irrigation. The momentum of manure accumulation is even greater. Before the Spring Festival, it is required to accumulate 1,500 dan of manure per mu, so that every mound has a pond, and every pond has fertilizer. Now the team averages more than 450 dan of manure per mu, determined to strive for more fertilizer and more grain.

    不平常的一年
    中共湖南常德金刚公社临沅大队总支书记　罗世秋
    大跃进的1959年已经过去了，这一年过得真不平常。党的社会主义建设的总路线，带给了我们一个胜利又一个胜利。就以我们常德金刚公社临沅大队来说吧，坚决贯彻总路线以后，群众思想觉悟大大提高，生产上更是满堂红。去年，我们大队在一百二十五天旱灾的威胁下，经过艰苦奋斗，禾苗全部抢救出来，每亩田全年平均粮食产量达到了九百四十五斤，比前年增产90％以上。这是社员们做梦也没有想到的。最近，中共常德地委生产检查团到我们队上检查生产，帮助我们总结了一年来的生产成绩，与我们一道欢庆农业大丰收。社员们都是喜气洋洋，到处张灯结采。六十七岁的贫农社员陈光尧，现在的劲头不知有多大，他每天坚持收野粪二百多斤，落雨天气也很少休息。最近，公社为了帮助他解决过冬的一些困难，给这位老年人发了棉被、棉衣，并告诉他队上正在搞年终结算，他还能得到几十元的工资。党和公社对他的这些关怀，他非常感动，他经常笑嘻嘻地告诉别人：“我是快七十多的人了，没看到遇上这么大的旱灾，还能收到这么多谷子，只有人民公社才能做到这一步呀。我身体还很硬实，还要为公社尽一把力哩！”像这样生产积极的人，我们大队还多得很。
    去年是胜利了，但是这胜利并不是容易得来的。总路线精神战胜了许多右倾保守的思想情绪。这包括我自己在内。
    去年2月初，公社党委召开了一次大队总支书记会议，决定以大队为单位，开展对手生产竞赛。我们临沅大队的对手是邻近的万沅大队。开头，我却有许多畏难情绪。我们大队是一片丘陵地带，土质算是公社里最差的，并且水源不好，劳力负担又重。万沅大队却不是这样，他们是平原地带、土质好，地是油砂地，田是猪肝泥田。他们的劳力负担也轻，平均每人负担的田地也比较少。我认为我们的条件太差，赶不上万沅大队，无法与他们竞赛，我曾找公社党委说明困难。党委及时对我进行了帮助，说我不放下思想包袱，就没有办法力争上游，完成党的任务；并要我考虑：条件能不能创造？凭什么创造条件？特别是对照总路线精神想一想。回家后，我认真思考了党委的话，认真想想党的总路线精神，头脑就亮堂多啦！我慢慢地想通了，为了广泛发动群众，大胆向万沅大队提出生产竞赛。在一次一千七百多人参加的群众大会上，我坦率地向群众谈到了自己上边谈的那些不对头的思想和克服这种思想的过程，说明了只要认真去按总路线精神考虑问题，干劲就来了。群众认为那次会开得对劲，和我有同样顾虑的人，也都放下了思想包袱，决心与万沅大队比个高低。这样，我们的干劲鼓起以后，便立即行动起来了。
    首先，我们紧紧抓住了生产的季节性，每项农事活动都尽量的提前季节。老农经常说：“锹把抓得稳，季节是根本”。在那次群众大会以后，我们队上的积肥翻耕运动，就敲响了锣鼓。没有几天，每亩积肥就达到九百多担。3月15日，我们的谷芽子就下泥了，比公社党委规定的日期提前五天；插秧又比万沅大队提前十天。接着，我们大力开展了土壤改良工作。4月初，县委第一书记李新革同志到我们队上检查生产。他一见面就向我说：“老罗，我到你们这里来，要先看看你们的龚家坪有没有变化。”党委的眼睛多明亮啊！龚家坪是我们大队土质最差的地方。以前，不管年成好不好，那里总是收不到几粒谷子的。我们把龚家坪作为改良土壤的重点。由于大力作了土壤改良工作，禾苗与往年全不同了，长得一溜青。龚家坪就不是往年的龚家坪了。
    我们的秧插得早，早稻收割比万沅大队早八、九天，晚稻提前插下去了。这时旱象开始了，我们就全力投入了抗旱。我们的口号是从大河里要粮，从沟港里取丰收。两天两晚，我们架起了一千六百多米长的枧槽，挖了一条长二千六百米的水渠。干旱一百二十多天，我们就战斗了一百二十多天，最后我们胜利了。
    最近，我们大队制订了1960年的生产规划。全队的四千多亩水田全部插双季稻，粮食总产量将比1959年大大增加。从现在起，大队预备建立一个千头养猪场，年产生猪五千头。今年还要开辟蔬菜基地四百亩，每亩争取收入二千五百元。这些规划通过群众讨论后，一致表示赞成，都决心以实际行动实现规划。目前，水利方面已完成八万九千多土方，基本上实现了灌溉自流化。积肥声势更大，春节以前，要求每亩积肥一千五百担，做到丘丘有氹，氹氹有肥，现在全队平均每亩已积肥四百五十多担，决心争取肥多谷多。
