Guangdong Strengthens Leadership and Concentrates Efforts to Rush Repair Key Projects
Yunnan Repairs and Stores Water Simultaneously, Making Every Effort to Expand Spring Irrigation Area
Shandong Skillfully Battles Severe Cold and Launches Over-Quota, High-Efficiency Competition

    This newspaper Guangzhou, January 16th dispatch: Guangdong Province, on the basis of completing more than 175,000 large and small water conservancy projects in winter repairs, is advancing victoriously, concentrating efforts to focus on key projects, accelerating the soil filling speed of earth dams, and striving to basically complete them before the Spring Festival or reach a degree that ensures safety.
    The key projects newly built and continued in Guangdong this year, benefiting more than 10,000 mu, are mostly the backbone projects for realizing water conservancy based on river basins or irrigation areas. These projects must be completed or reach a degree that ensures safety before the spring flood season, otherwise it will not only affect spring plowing but also be threatened by spring floods. Therefore, all localities have attached great importance to these key projects from the beginning, and especially during this recent period, they have seized the favorable conditions of basically completing small-scale water conservancy projects, concentrated efforts to focus on key projects, and tried every means to accelerate the construction progress of key projects.
    In order to accelerate the construction progress of key projects, all localities, in addition to ensuring the labor force required for key projects, have particularly strengthened the leadership of key projects. All key projects are personally commanded by the county party secretary and commune party secretary at the front line, discovering and solving problems on the spot. In Shaoguan Special District, twenty-two county party secretaries and ninety-four commune party secretaries personally grasped key projects. In many areas, the party secretaries personally manage high-efficiency experimental plots for key projects to promote the high-efficiency movement.
    In the process of focusing on key projects and carrying out the high-efficiency movement, all localities concentrated the main labor force to fiercely attack the earth dam soil filling. Through the rational arrangement of the labor force, the soil filling speed of the Longjing Reservoir in Jieyang County increased sharply from more than 20,000 cubic meters per day to more than 30,000 cubic meters per day. The Shenzhen Reservoir construction site in Dongguan County changed its past practice of only paying attention to how many cubic meters of earth were completed each day, focusing on the amount of soil filling for the earth dam, dividing the dam section, and organizing high-efficiency competitions, which also greatly accelerated the progress of the dam filling project.
    Since the earth dam is getting higher and higher, and transporting soil to the dam is becoming more and more difficult, all construction sites regard reforming the tools for transporting soil to the dam as the key to improving the efficiency of dam filling.

    This newspaper Kunming, January 16th dispatch: The laborers on the water conservancy construction sites in Yunnan Province are making every effort to expand the irrigated area and ensure that 20 million mu of major spring crops, accounting for one-half of the province's cultivated land, are free from drought and waterlogging. At present, the amount of water conservancy projects completed in the province has increased by more than double compared with the same period in 1958. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, party organizations at all levels throughout the province are concentrating superior forces to solve the water conservancy problems of some dry dams along important transportation lines and around industrial and mining areas that are of special significance to this year's grain production, and to launch surprise attacks to build key projects that can benefit in the same year. For example, the Mengzi Dam, located in the suburbs of Gejiu, the tin capital, and on the railway line, is a famous dry dam in the province. Even in relatively favorable years, the 340,000 mu of cultivated land often yield very little. By last year, the irrigated area was only 120,000 mu. This year, the county party committee concentrated manpower and materials to start the construction of nine water conservancy projects, mainly the 80-kilometer-long Gongnong Grand Canal. This grand canal is the first cross-basin water diversion project in Yunnan, which can divert water to irrigate 220,000 mu of land. After it is completed in March, 90,000 mu can benefit in the same year. The Xiangyun Dam in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture is also one of the most famous drought dams in the province. After the key projects are completed this spring, 220,000 mu of the 340,000 mu of cultivated land will be irrigated. At present, more than ten key water conservancy areas throughout the province are concentrating superior forces to fight "annihilation wars" in an effort to change the face of drought as soon as possible. The Provincial Party Committee attaches great importance to the construction work in these key areas and key projects and has given great support. Therefore, although the projects in these areas are very arduous, the progress is relatively fast, and generally, they can be irrigated and benefit during spring plowing.
    According to the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on concentrating on the construction of projects that benefit in the same year, all localities have repeatedly lined up and inspected water conservancy projects in their areas, adjusted forces, and strengthened projects that can benefit earlier. The Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture transferred forces from construction sites that could not benefit in the same year to strengthen key projects. According to the current progress, it is estimated that five of the nine medium-sized water conservancy projects that were originally planned to not be completed this year are certain to be completed and benefit ahead of schedule. The Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has supplemented the labor force for key projects, which can also greatly increase this year's irrigated area. After inspection and adjustment of forces, the Yuxi Special District can increase the irrigated area this year by about 70% more than originally planned.
    At present, in the province's newly built reservoirs, the vast majority of those with perennial flowing water that can be stored and benefit in the same year are being built and storing water simultaneously. Including old projects, the province's reservoirs have stored more than 6 billion cubic meters of water.

    This newspaper Jinan, January 16th dispatch: The water control heroes in Shandong skillfully fought against the severe cold, closely grasped the matching of tools, so that the daily progress of earth and stone projects in the province increased three times, and strived to complete this year's water conservancy construction tasks ahead of schedule to ensure benefits for spring plowing.
    In 1959, on the basis of the widespread development of small-scale projects, Shandong successively built a number of large and medium-sized projects. More than 90% of these reservoir projects are located in high-cold mountainous areas, which require opening mountains and digging caves, building high dams, and transporting materials over long distances. After the heavy snow sealed the ground, construction added many new difficulties. However, the water conservancy corps of the people's communes tried every means to fight against the severe cold. Changwei Special District rushed to build more than 500 ice roads and more than 10,000 ice-skating soil carriers, realizing ice-road skating transportation, and the efficiency increased three or four times. Large and medium-sized project construction sites throughout the province are generally using explosives to blast frozen soil, excavate spillways, and split mountains to obtain materials, and one shot can loosen tens of thousands of cubic meters of soil. In terms of construction technology, many advanced methods of antifreeze have also been created. Such as taking soil from the sunny side, loosening the soil to keep it warm, storing the soil to keep it warm, keeping the dam surface warm, transporting the soil to keep it warm, and continuous operation from digging, transporting, laying to compacting. The Qingfengling Reservoir Project Command in Ju County created an advanced construction method of the "three shifts and six operations." This method divides the laborers into three shifts, each shift working twice a day, each working four hours, circulating operations, resting people but not tools, which not only achieves a combination of work and rest but also avoids freezing.
    On the basis of tool reform, many construction sites have vigorously carried out tool matching, realizing soil loosening blasting, soil transportation rail, dam power traction, loading and unloading automation, construction site transportation road, and construction site management factory. In order to support the tool matching of the Xiashan Reservoir construction site, the industrial department of Changwei Special District adopted the method of linking factories and construction sites, allocating 75 twelve-horsepower diesel engines, 18,000 meters of iron rails, and 12 small internal combustion locomotives, making the efficiency of this valley reservoir more than twice the national quota. Thirty-six large factories and enterprises in Qingdao City are contracted to support the tool matching work of eighteen large and medium-sized construction sites. Front and rear, factories and construction sites, cadres and the masses, have launched a lively tool matching competition.
    In the struggle against ice and severe cold, party secretaries at all levels stood at the forefront of the movement. Comrade Shu Tong, first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, visited the main water conservancy construction sites successively. Chen Hongbo, first secretary of the Changwei Prefectural Committee, led engineering and technical personnel to backward areas to help with tool reform and also went deep into the workers' sheds to check and comfort them.

    争取水利工程当年受益
    广东加强领导集中力量抢修重点工程
    云南边修边蓄千方百计扩大春灌面积
    山东巧战严寒开展超定额高工效竞赛
    本报广州16日电　广东省各地冬修水利在完成大小型水利工程十七万五千多宗的基础上，正乘胜前进，集中力量大抓重点工程，加快土坝进土速度，力争在春节前基本完成或达到确保安全程度。
    广东今年新建和续建受益万亩以上的重点工程，大都是按流域或灌溉区域实现水利化的骨干。这些工程必须赶在春汛前头完成或达到确保安全程度，否则不仅影响春耕，还有受春洪威胁的危险。因此，各地一开始就非常重视这些重点工程，最近期间特别抓紧小型水利已基本完成的有利条件，集中力量大抓重点工程，想尽一切办法加速重点工程施工的进度。
    各地为了加速重点工程的施工进度，除了保证重点工程所需的劳动力之外，特别加强了重点工程的领导力量。所有重点工程都分别由县委书记、公社党委书记亲临前线指挥，就地发现问题、解决问题。韶关专区就有二十二个县委书记、九十四个公社党委书记亲自抓重点工程。许多地区的重点工程还由党委书记亲自办高工效试验田，推动高工效运动。
    各地在大抓重点工程、开展高工效运动中，集中主要劳动力猛攻土坝进土关。揭阳县龙颈水库通过合理安排劳动力，使土坝的进土速度由原来日进二万多公方激增到三万多公方。东莞县深圳水库工地改变了过去只注意抓每天完成多少土方的做法，着重抓土坝进土量，划分坝段、组织高工效竞赛，也大大加快了填坝工程的进度。
    由于土坝越筑越高，运土上坝越来越艰巨，因此各工地都把改革运土上坝的工具，作为提高填坝工效的关键。
    本报昆明16日电　云南省水利工地上的民工，正在千方百计扩大灌溉面积，确保占全省耕地二分之一的二千万亩大春作物，做到水旱无忧。目前，全省已完成的水利工程量较1958年同期增加一倍以上。全省各级党组织根据省委的指示，集中优势力量解决重要交通沿线、工矿区周围对今年粮食增产有特殊意义的一些干坝的水利问题，和突击兴修当年可以受益的重点工程。如座落在锡都箇旧郊区和铁路线上的蒙自坝子，是全省著名的干坝子，三十四万亩耕地即使在比较风调雨顺的年成，也往往收成很少，到去年，灌溉面积还只有十二万亩。县委今年集中了人力物力，动工兴修以长达八十多公里的工农大沟为主的九件水利工程。这条大沟是云南第一件跨流域引水工程，可以引水灌溉二十二万亩田地，3月份完工后，有九万亩可以当年受益。大理白族自治州的祥云坝子，也是全省最著名的干旱坝子之一，今春重点工程完工后，三十四万亩耕地中，将有二十二万亩得到灌溉。目前，全省十多个水利重点地区，都在集中优势力量打“歼灭战”，力争尽快改变干旱面貌。省委对于这些重点地区、重点工程的建设工作十分重视，给予了很大的支援。因此这些地区的工程虽很艰巨，但进度都较快，一般都可在春耕时灌溉受益。
    各地根据省委突击兴修当年受益工程指示的精神，都先后对本地区水利工程反复排队检查，调整力量，加强了可以早受益的工程。红河哈尼族彝族自治州从当年不能受益的工地上抽调力量，加强重点工程后，根据目前进度推算，原计划今年不能完成的九件中型水利工程，五件有把握提前完工受益。文山僮族苗族自治州充实了重点工程的劳力，也可以使今年的灌溉面积大大增加。玉溪专区经过检查，调整力量，今年可以增加的灌溉面积，约比原计划增加70％以上。
    目前，全省新修水库中，凡是有长流水可蓄，又在当年受益的，绝大部分正在边修边蓄水。包括老工程在内，全省水库蓄水已达六十多亿立方米。
    本报济南16日电　山东各地治水英雄们巧战严寒，紧抓工具配套，使全省土石方工程的日进度提高三倍，力争提前完成今年水利建设任务，保证春耕受益。
    1959年山东各地在小型工程遍地开花的基础上，先后兴修了一批大中型工程。这些水库工程有90％以上在高寒山区，需要开山凿洞，高筑大坝，远途运料。大雪封地以后，施工又增加许多新的困难。但是各人民公社的水利兵团，千方百计向严寒搏斗。昌潍专区赶修了五百多条冰道，一万多件滑冰运土器，实现冰道滑运化，工效提高三、四倍。全省各大中型工程工地，正普遍利用火药爆破冻土，开挖溢洪道和劈山取料，一炮能松土几万立方米。在施工技术上，也创造了许多防冻的先进方法。如向阳取土，松土保温，蓄土保温，坝面保温，运土保温，以及从挖土、运土、铺填到轧实，实行连续操作，一气呵成。莒县青峰岭水库工程指挥部创造了“三班六作制”的先进施工法。这个方法是把民工分为三班，每班每天分两次劳动，一次劳动四个小时，循环作业，歇人不歇工具，既达到劳逸结合，还避免了冰冻。
    许多工地在工具改革的基础上，大搞工具配套，实现了松土爆破化、运土轨道化、上坝动力牵引化、装卸自动化、工地交通马路化、工地管理工厂化。昌潍专区工业部门为支援峡山水库工地的工具配套，采取工厂和工地挂钩的办法，调拨十二马力柴油机七十五台，铁轨一万八千米，小型内燃机车十二部，使这个山谷水库工效超过国家定额二倍。青岛市有三十六个大型工厂企业，分别包干支援十八个大中型工地工具配套工作。前方后方，工厂工地，干部群众，都开展了热火朝天的工具配套竞赛。
    在向冰冻严寒作斗争中，各级党委书记站在运动的最前线。省委第一书记舒同同志先后到各主要水利工地视察。昌潍地委第一书记陈洪波带着工程技术人员到落后地区帮助工具改革，还深入工棚检查慰问。
