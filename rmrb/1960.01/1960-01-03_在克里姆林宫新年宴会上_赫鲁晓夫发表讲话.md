New Year Will Bring Better Situation
At New Year's Banquet in the Kremlin
Khrushchev Delivers Speech
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 2nd. According to TASS report on January 1st: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, proposed a toast to the past year in his speech at the traditional New Year’s banquet held by the Soviet government in the Kremlin on the evening of January 1st. He said that this year has clearly demonstrated the possibility of easing international tensions and consolidating peace. The head of the Soviet government expressed his firm belief that 1960 will be even better.

Khrushchev suggested that foreign envoys drink to lasting world peace and the friendship of people of all countries.

He hoped that the ambassadors of all countries would do everything possible to consolidate the friendship of the people of all countries and world peace.

Referring to the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly, Khrushchev said:

If our proposal is adopted, we are ready to disband our army at any time, and all our soldiers will welcome this decision. But if the advocates of the "Cold War" want to drag us into the endless maze of arguments, are we going to go the way they want to push us? Khrushchev pointed out that we ourselves might as well consider unilaterally reducing our armed forces and using rockets to defend our borders.

The chief representative of the diplomatic envoys, Swedish Ambassador Sohlman, made a brief speech on behalf of the foreign diplomatic envoys at the banquet.

Gaofu Issues New Year's Message
Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 1st. Gaofu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly, issued a New Year's message on behalf of the Party and the government, saying that 1959 was a year of heroic deeds in the thriving socialist motherland, a year of increasing national strength, and a year of continuous improvement in the living standards of the working people.

He pointed out that the economic victories and the increase in industrial and agricultural production achieved in the past year are unprecedented. This is the result of the victory of the socialist system.

He said that the Bulgarian government will spare no effort to strive for trust, good-neighborly relations, and peace with the people of the Balkan countries, and strive to resolve outstanding issues through negotiations in order to achieve mutual understanding.

Sambuu Delivers New Year's Speech
Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, January 1st. Sambuu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural of Mongolia, said in his New Year's Eve speech welcoming the New Year that, inspired by the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people are advancing along the road of a high tide of socialist construction. The realization of agricultural and pastoral cooperation is playing a significant role in accelerating Mongolia's construction.

Reviewing the achievements of Mongolia's socialist construction in 1959, Sambuu pointed out that in 1959, the Mongolian working people launched a patriotic competition to complete production plans. The people's socialist labor consciousness is being further enhanced. The rapid development of national economy and cultural construction is a solid foundation for the continuous improvement of people's living standards.

Sambuu said that 1960 is the final year of Mongolia's three-year plan. With the realization of the construction plan for the new year, Mongolia's socialist material foundation will be consolidated and expanded. He called on the Mongolian people to exert all their energy and wisdom to strive for the overfulfillment of the 1960 plan.

Maurer Issues New Year's Greetings
Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 1st. Maurer, Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian Grand National Assembly, delivered New Year's greetings to the Romanian people last night.

In his congratulatory message, Maurer said that in the past year, the Romanian people have achieved brilliant accomplishments in developing the economy and culture, and the people's living standards have also improved. This is the result of the selfless labor of the working class, peasants, and intellectuals throughout the country, and the result of implementing the policies of the Romanian Workers' Party. In the new year, our people will confidently use their creative labor to strive for new achievements.

Maurer pointed out that in the new year, the Romanian people, together with other socialist countries, will continue to fight for peace and cooperation between countries with different social systems.

    在克里姆林宫新年宴会上
    赫鲁晓夫发表讲话
    新华社莫斯科2日电　据塔斯社1日报道：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫1日晚上在苏联政府在克里姆林宫举行的传统新年宴会上讲话时建议为正在过去的一年干杯。他说，这一年显然表现出了缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的可能性。苏联政府首脑表示深信，1960年将更好。
    赫鲁晓夫建议外国使节们为世界持久和平、为各国人民友谊干一杯。
    他希望各国大使尽一切力量来巩固各国人民的友谊和世界和平。
    赫鲁晓夫提到苏联在联合国大会提出的全面彻底裁军计划时说：
    如果我们的建议被采纳，我们准备随时解散我们的军队，而且我国所有的军人都将欢迎这个决定。但是如果“冷战”拥护者要把我们拖进无穷无尽的争论迷宫中去，我们是不是要走上他们想把我们推上去的道路呢？赫鲁晓夫指出，我们自己是否不妨考虑单方面地裁减我们的武装部队，而用火箭来保卫我们的边界。
    外交使节的首席代表、瑞典大使索尔曼代表各国外交使节在宴会上作了简短的讲话。
