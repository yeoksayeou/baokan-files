Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 9th: The January issue of "Study," a theoretical journal of the Vietnamese Labor Party, published a special issue commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese Labor Party, featuring important articles written by President Ho Chi Minh of the Vietnamese Labor Party and other leaders.

    In his article entitled "Thirty Years of Party Activities," President Ho Chi Minh comprehensively described the correct, heroic, and glorious path the Vietnamese Labor Party has traversed over the past thirty years, the brilliant victories the Party has achieved in those thirty years, and pointed out the future tasks of the Vietnamese people's struggle.

    President Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the establishment of the Indochinese Communist Party (the predecessor of the Vietnamese Labor Party) "is an extremely important turning point in the history of the Vietnamese revolution. It proves that the Vietnamese working class has grown and has sufficient ability to lead the revolution."

    President Ho Chi Minh then analyzed the several periods that the Vietnamese Labor Party has roughly experienced over the past thirty years: "The period of secret activities; the period of leading the August Revolution to success; the period of leading the War of Resistance to success; the future period, that is, the period when the Party leads the socialist revolution in North Vietnam and the struggle for the unification of the country, in order to complete the national democratic revolution throughout the country."

    President Ho Chi Minh outlined the great achievements made by the Vietnamese Labor Party in various periods. When talking about the great construction achievements made by the people of North Vietnam under the leadership of the Party after the restoration of peace in Vietnam, he said that North Vietnam, in the three years from 1955 to 1957, had restored industrial and agricultural production to levels close to the pre-war level of 1939. In 1939, North Vietnam could only produce 2.5 million tons of grain, while in 1956 it could produce more than 4 million tons of grain; 29 old enterprises were restored and 55 new enterprises were built. On this basis, North Vietnam began to implement the Three-Year (1958-1960) Construction Plan. President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "The focus of the Three-Year Plan is to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private capitalist industry and commerce, and the main link is to transform and develop agriculture."

    He also talked about the great achievements of North Vietnam's cultural undertakings. He said that in 1939, the whole of Indochina had only 582 university students, while in 1959 the number of university students in North Vietnam reached 7,518. In 1939, there were only 54 hospitals in central and northern Vietnam, while in 1959 North Vietnam already had 138 hospitals.

    President Ho Chi Minh then analyzed the reasons for the victories achieved by the Vietnamese Labor Party over the past thirty years. President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "The reasons for achieving these victories are: Our Party has always stood firmly on the proletarian stand, absolutely loyal to the interests of the working class and the people, is good at applying Marxism-Leninism to the actual situation of our country, and has put forward correct lines and policies. In the national movement, our Party has continuously carried out struggles against the tendency of bourgeois reformism and petty-bourgeois adventurism; opposed the 'left' leaning arguments of Trotskyites in the workers' movement, and opposed right-leaning and 'left' leaning tendencies in formulating and implementing the Party's revolutionary strategy and tactics in each period. Marxism-Leninism has helped our Party withstand these tests."

    President Ho Chi Minh wrote: "Marxism-Leninism helped our Party realize that in a backward agricultural country like ours, the national question is essentially the peasant question, the national revolution is essentially the peasant revolution led by the proletariat, and the people's regime is essentially the worker-peasant regime. Therefore, in every period, the Party has grasped and correctly solved the peasant question and consolidated the worker-peasant alliance."

    President Ho Chi Minh wrote: "Our Party is good at concentrating all patriotic and progressive forces in the national united front, realizing national unity, and carrying out the struggle against imperialism and feudal forces. The main force in national unity is the workers and peasants. Therefore, the worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of the national united front." He wrote: "Our Party grew up in the environment of the successful Russian October Socialist Revolution. Every victory of our Party and our people is inseparable from the support of the Soviet Union, China, the entire socialist camp, and the international communist movement and workers' movement, the world peace movement, and the national liberation movement. It is precisely because we understand how to combine our country's revolutionary movement with the revolutionary movement of the international working class and oppressed nations that the Party can overcome all difficulties and guide our country's working class and people to achieve such brilliant victories today."

    President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "Our country's north has been completely liberated, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is proud to be a member of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. Our Party has hundreds of thousands of members, who are organizing and leading our people to build a north marching towards socialism and to struggle for the realization of national unity. Our Party has always stood at the forefront of the national people's revolutionary struggle. It will always hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism, resolutely lead the entire people to fight for building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam, and make contributions to safeguarding peace in Southeast Asia and the world."

    Truong Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Labor Party Central Committee, in his long article entitled "The Strategic Policy of Our Party," systematically expounded on the objects of the Vietnamese revolution, the basic contradictions existing in Vietnam, the driving force of the Vietnamese revolution, and the strategic policy put forward by the Party.

    Le Duan, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, wrote an article entitled "Marching Towards Science, Vigorously Advancing the Socialist Revolution in the North," which expounded on the importance of improving cultural, scientific, and technological levels in promoting the socialist revolution in Vietnam and realizing socialist industrialization.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 9th: The Vietnamese Labor Party's organ "People's Daily" continuously published on the 7th and 8th Truong Chinh's long report delivered on January 5th at the Hanoi People's Celebration of the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Labor Party.

    In his report, Truong Chinh detailed the history of the Vietnamese Labor Party and its predecessor, the Indochinese Communist Party, over the past thirty years of heroic struggle, and summarized two main experiences from the glorious victories of the Labor Party over the past thirty years: "First, it is necessary to combine the theory of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Vietnamese revolution in order to formulate lines, principles, and policies to guide the Vietnamese revolution to victory; second, in order to ensure the victory of the Vietnamese revolution, it is necessary to create, cultivate, and strengthen the factors that promote the victory of the Vietnamese revolution."

    When talking about the current tasks of the entire Party and the entire people of Vietnam, Truong Chinh eloquently explained the rapid development of socialist construction in North Vietnam in recent years with many specific figures. He also vividly illustrated the desolate and impoverished situation in South Vietnam under the rule of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in recent years with concrete examples. Truong Chinh said that North Vietnam will basically complete agricultural cooperation this year, and will transform a part of the primary agricultural cooperatives into advanced agricultural cooperatives; organize most of the handicraftsmen and small traders, and transfer a part of the small traders into production; and basically complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    Truong Chinh said that it is necessary to vigorously promote the cultural and professional training movement for cadres, staff, and workers; vigorously carry out the training of economic cadres, technical cadres, and skilled workers on the job, in enterprises, in schools, at home and abroad; and initially establish the foundation for scientific research work, basic exploration and comprehensive exploration work, in order to prepare for the future five-year plan.

    When talking about Vietnam's struggle for a unified country, Truong Chinh said that the issue of unifying the motherland fundamentally depends on the revolutionary forces of the people in the north and south, and the sympathy and support of the world's peace forces and socialist forces is also very important. The entire people of Vietnam must make great efforts to guide North Vietnam onto the path of socialism, vigorously advance the national democratic revolutionary movement in South Vietnam, strengthen solidarity with the fraternal socialist countries, and strive for the sympathy and support of peace-loving people around the world.

    Truong Chinh pointed out that national independence, democratic livelihood, and safeguarding peace are the three specific goals of the South Vietnamese revolution. The development process of the South Vietnamese revolution is the process of uniting and organizing all forces against the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

    Truong Chinh said that from now until the realization of the unification of the motherland, it may be necessary to go through several transitional stages. Although there will be some difficulties in these transitional stages, we will persist in realizing the peaceful unification of the motherland, because this is the earnest desire of the people of the whole country and the desire of the peace-loving people of the world. However, US imperialism and its running dogs are bellicose, so we must be ready to take all measures to crush their conspiracies of aggression and provocation at any time.

    Truong Chinh finally said that 1960 will be a year worth recording in the history of the Vietnamese nation. In this year, the entire people of Vietnam will work hard to strive for unprecedented victories in all aspects and prepare for greater victories in the future.

    越南劳动党领导人撰文纪念建党三十周年
    越南北方今年将基本完成社会主义改造
    号召大力推进南方的民族民主革命运动
    新华社河内9日电　越南劳动党理论刊物“学习”杂志1月号为纪念越南劳动党成立三十周年出版特刊，刊载了越南劳动党胡志明主席和其他领导人撰写的重要文章。
    胡志明主席在题为“党三十年来的活动”一文中，全面地叙述了越南劳动党三十年来所走过的正确、英勇、光荣的道路和党在三十年中取得的辉煌胜利，并且指出了越南人民今后的斗争任务。
    胡志明主席指出，印度支那共产党（越南劳动党的前身）的成立“是越南革命史中无比重要的转捩点。它证明越南工人阶级已经成长，并有足够的能力领导革命”。
    胡主席接着分析了越南劳动党三十年来大体上经历的几个时期：“秘密活动时期；领导八月革命成功时期；领导抗战成功时期；今后时期，即党领导越南北方的社会主义革命和统一国家的斗争，以便在全国范围内完成民族民主革命的时期。”
    胡主席概述了越南劳动党在各个时期所取得的巨大成就。他在谈到党在越南和平恢复后领导越南北方人民取得伟大的建设成就时说，越南北方在从1955年到1957年的三年时间内已经把工业和农业生产恢复到接近战前1939年的水平。1939年，越南北方只能生产二百五十万吨谷子，而1956年已能生产四百多万吨谷子；恢复了二十九个旧企业和新建了五十五个企业。越南北方在这个基础上开始执行三年（1958—1960）建设计划。胡主席指出：“三年计划的重心是实现对农业、手工业和私营资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，主要的环节是改造和发展农业。”
    他还谈到越南北方的文化事业的巨大成就。他说，1939年全印度支那只有五百八十二名大学生，而1959年越南北方大学生人数达到七千五百一十八人。1939年越南中部和北部只有五十四所医院，而1959年越南北方已经有了一百三十八所医院。
    胡志明主席接着分析了越南劳动党三十年来取得胜利的原因。胡主席指出：“取得这些胜利的原因是：我党一贯站稳无产阶级立场，绝对忠诚于工人阶级和人民的利益，善于把马克思列宁主义运用到我国的实际情况中去，并提出了正确的路线和政策。我党在民族运动中，不断进行反对资产阶级改良主义和小资产阶级盲动主义倾向的斗争；反对托洛茨基分子在工人运动中的‘左’倾论调，并在制定和执行党在每个时期的革命战略和策略中反对右倾和‘左’倾倾向。马克思列宁主义已经帮助我们的党经受了这些考验。”
    胡主席写道：“马克思列宁主义帮助我党认识到，在一个像我国这样落后的农业国家中，民族问题实质上就是农民问题，民族革命实质上就是由无产阶级领导的农民革命，人民政权实质上就是工农政权。因此，在各个时期，党掌握了并正确地解决了农民问题，巩固了工农联盟。”
    胡主席写道：“我党善于在民族统一战线中集中一切爱国的进步的力量，实现民族团结，进行反对帝国主义和封建势力的斗争。在民族团结中的主要力量是工人和农民。因此，工农联盟是民族统一战线的基础”。他写道：“我党是在俄国十月社会主义革命取得成功的环境中成长的。我党和我国人民的每一个胜利是同苏联、中国、整个社会主义阵营、国际共产主义运动和工人运动、世界和平运动和民族解放运动的支持分不开的。正因为懂得把我国的革命运动同国际工人阶级和被压迫民族的革命运动结合起来，党才能战胜一切困难，引导我国工人阶级和人民取得今天这样光辉的胜利。”
    胡主席指出：“我国北方已经完全解放，越南民主共和国以自己作为以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的一员而感到自豪。我党有数十万党员，他们正在组织和领导我国人民建设向社会主义迈进的北方和为实现国家的统一而斗争。我党一向站在全国人民革命斗争的前列，它永远高举爱国主义和社会主义的旗帜，坚决领导全民为建设和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南而斗争，为维护东南亚和世界和平作出贡献。”
    劳动党中央政治局委员长征在题为“我党的战略方针”的长篇文章里系统地阐述了关于越南革命的对象、越南国内存在的基本矛盾、越南革命的动力和党提出的战略方针等问题。
    越南劳动党中央政治局委员黎笋撰写的题为“向科学进军，大力推进北方的社会主义革命”的文章，阐述了提高文化、科学和技术水平对促进越南社会主义革命和实现社会主义工业化的重要意义。
    新华社河内9日电　越南劳动党机关报“人民报”7日和8日连续刊登了越南劳动党中央政治局委员长征1月5日在河内各界人民庆祝劳动党建党三十周年大会上所作的长篇报告。
    长征在报告中详细叙述了越南劳动党及其前身印度支那共产党三十年来英勇奋斗的历史，并给劳动党三十年来取得了光荣的胜利的斗争总结出两条主要的经验：“一、必须把马克思列宁主义的理论同越南革命实践相结合以制定引导越南革命走向胜利的路线、方针和政策；二、为了保证越南革命的胜利，必须创造、培养和加强促使越南革命胜利的因素。”
    长征在谈到越南全党全民的当前任务时，以许多具体数字雄辩地说明了越南北方几年来的社会主义建设的飞跃发展。他还以具体的事例有力地阐明了美国—吴庭艳集团统治下的越南南方几年来百业萧条，民不聊生的景况。长征说，越南北方今年将基本完成农业合作化，并把一部分初级农业社转为高级农业社；把大部分的手工业者和小商贩组织起来，并把一部分小商贩转入生产；基本完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
    长征说，必须大力推进干部、职工的文化进修和业务进修运动；大力进行在职、在企业、在学校、在国内外培养经济干部、技术干部和熟练工人；初步建立科学研究工作、基本勘探和综合勘探工作的基础，为今后的五年计划作好准备。
    长征谈到越南争取统一国家的斗争时说，统一祖国的问题根本上取决于南北两地的人民革命力量，世界和平力量和社会主义力量的同情和支持也是非常重要的。越南全体人民必须作出巨大的努力，以引导越南北方走上社会主义，大力推进越南南方的民族民主革命运动，加强同各社会主义兄弟国家的团结，争取世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持。
    长征指出，民族独立、民主民生、保卫和平是越南南方革命的三个具体目标。南越革命的发展过程就是团结和组织一切反对美国—吴庭艳集团的力量的过程。
    长征说，从现在到祖国实现统一的期间，可能需要经过几个过渡阶段，尽管在这些过渡阶段中会遇到一些困难，但是我们将坚持实现和平统一祖国，因为这是全国人民的殷切愿望，也是世界爱好和平人民的愿望。然而，美帝国主义和它的走狗是好战的，因此我们必须随时准备采取一切办法来粉碎它们的侵略和挑衅阴谋。
    长征最后说，1960年将是值得载入越南民族史册的一年，越南全体人民在这一年里将努力奋斗，争取在各方面取得空前的胜利，并为今后取得更伟大的胜利作好准备。
