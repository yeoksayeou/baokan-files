Xinhua News Agency, London, January 25th: The Kenya Constitutional Conference held its first meeting today with African participation.

The Kenya Constitutional Conference officially opened a week ago, but fourteen African representatives boycotted the conference for the past week because the British government and white "settler" representatives refused to allow an African special advisor, Konange, to attend the meeting. Today's meeting was held after a compromise agreement was reached, stipulating that special advisors for both African and European representatives could enter Lancaster House where the meeting was held, but could not enter the meeting room itself.

This compromise was agreed to by the African representatives and some European representatives of the New Kenya Party. However, the extreme right-wing group of colonists within the Kenya United Party, led by Briggs, rejected the compromise. Despite Briggs' boycott by walking out of the meeting, the meeting continued.

The leader of the African delegation, Ngalah, demanded at the meeting that the British government clearly state that Kenya's goal is independence, and that it must clearly state after the meeting that Kenya will obtain a responsible government when colonial rule ends. He emphasized that there must be a common electoral roll for universal suffrage.

Tom Mboya, another leader of the African delegation, also emphasized the need for every adult to have the right to vote and the need for a common electoral roll. Mboya said at a public gathering tonight that the African continent is rapidly shaking off the rule of European colonialism. This is a force not to be taken lightly. He said that some people are worried about losing their imperial and special status. They are far behind the times. They should have lived in a time long, long ago.

Mboya said that Africans are gaining their freedom and independence and re-establishing their prestige and self-esteem.

Referring to the attitude of the colonists who have been creating trouble in the talks, Mboya pointed out that these colonists are supported by the British government.

    怯尼亚制宪会议举行首次会议
    非洲人代表主张怯尼亚独立
    新华社伦敦25日电　怯尼亚制宪会议今天举行了有非洲人参加的第一次会议。
    怯尼亚制宪会议本来在一星期前便已正式开幕，但是由于英国政府和白种“移民”代表拒绝让一位非洲人特别顾问柯南格参加会议，十四位非洲人代表在过去一星期抵制了这个会议。今天的会议是在达成折衷协议后举行的，这个协议规定非洲人和欧洲人代表的特别顾问全都可以进入举行会议的兰开斯特大厦，但是不能进入会议室内。
    这个折衷办法得到非洲人代表和参加新怯尼亚党的部分欧洲人代表的同意。但是怯尼亚联合党内以布里格斯为首的殖民者极右集团拒绝了这个折衷办法。尽管布里格斯退出会场进行抵制，但是会议还是继续进行。
    非洲人代表团领袖恩加拉在会上要求英国政府明确地声明，怯尼亚的目标是独立，并且在会后必须明确表示，怯尼亚在殖民统治结束的时候起将获得负责的政府。他着重指出，必须有共同选举名单来进行普选。
    非洲人代表团的另一位领袖汤姆·姆博亚也着重指出，需要每个成年人都享有投票权，需要有共同选举名单。姆博亚今晚在一次公众集会上说，非洲大陆正在迅速地摆脱欧洲殖民主义的统治。这是一股不能等闲视之的力量。他说，有些人担心失去帝国的和特殊的地位。他们远远落后于他们所处的时代了。他们本来应当活在很久很久以前的时代。
    姆博亚说，非洲人正在获得他们的自由和独立和重新树立他们的威信和自尊心。
    谈到一直在会谈中制造麻烦的殖民者的态度时，姆博亚指出，这些殖民者得到英国政府的支持。
