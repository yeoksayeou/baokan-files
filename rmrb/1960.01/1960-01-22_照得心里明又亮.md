    Shining Brightly in Our Hearts
    In this column, we have selected a few short poems from our readers. From these, we can see the upsurge of learning Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong among the people, as well as the excitement and joy people feel when they grasp the truth.

    Short Poems on Studying Philosophy
    Flower
    Marxism-Leninism is a flower,
    Blossoming for miles, perfuming every home.
    Whoever picks the red flower to wear,
    Sky-high enthusiasm will follow!
    Enthusiasm Arises When Seeing Difficulties
    East wind blows, red flag waves,
    Chairman Mao's theory is truly high,
    Having just finished studying "On Contradiction,"
    Enthusiasm arises when seeing difficulties!
    Targets Leapt Over the New Year
    East wind smiles, red flag leaps,
    We have learned philosophy,
    Comrades, come and see,
    Targets leapt over the New Year.
        Tianjin Electrical Appliance Factory Worker Li Mujing
    Chairman Mao's Writings Are Like the Sun
    Chairman Mao's writings are like the sun,
    Every word and sentence shines with light,
    Illuminating thoughts redder and redder,
    Shining brightly in our hearts.
    Chairman Mao's writings are guiding lights,
    Shining clearly on the road to happiness,
    The road to communist paradise,
    A bright light hangs high to welcome us ahead.
    Treasures are inherently the most precious,
    Chairman Mao's writings are as evergreen as pine and cypress.
    Treasures never rust,
    Chairman Mao's writings are immortal.
    Chairman Mao's great red flag,
    Victory, victory, and more victory!
    We have Chairman Mao,
    Good fortune for generations to come!
                Li Zengrun
    Studying Theory
    Direction
    Heroes emerge on the production front,
    Be vanguards in studying theory,
    Our bodies must be forged into steel,
    Our minds must be stronger than steel!
    A ship without a rudder cannot sail,
    Without a compass, one loses direction,
    Study Mao Zedong Thought well,
    Even in the darkness, the sun will rise!
    New Gospel
    Uncle sits by the rice paddy,
    Holding a book in his hand,
    Not the Old Testament gospel,
    But a brand-new, well-bound "Selected Works of Mao!"
    "Believed in God for decades,
    No gospel in the gospel book,
    Where is the true gospel,
    To be found in Chairman Mao's writings!"
            Guangdong Taishan Overseas Chinese Middle School Tang Qi
    Reading Mao's Selected Works
    Not sleeping after getting off work at midnight,
    Burning the midnight oil to read Mao's Selected Works,
    The golden rooster crows, "The East is Red,"
    Eyes bright, mind clear, enthusiasm added.
          Henan Kaifeng Li Qing

    照得心里明又亮
    在这一栏里，我们选载了从读者中来的几首短诗。从这里，我们可以看到在人民群众中学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东同志著作的热潮，以及人们在掌握了真理时的兴奋和喜悦。
                                               ——编者
    学哲学小诗
    花
    马列主义是枝花，
    花开千里香万家。
    谁家采得红花戴，
    冲天干劲随着来！
    看见困难劲来了
    东风吹，红旗飘，
    毛主席理论就是高，
    刚刚学完“矛盾论”
    看见困难劲来了！
    指标一跳过了年
    东风笑，红旗跳，
    咱把哲学学来了，
    同志们呀，快来看，
    指标一跳过了年。
        天津电器厂工人　李慕静
    毛主席著作像太阳
    毛主席著作像太阳，
    字字句句放光芒，
    照的思想红又红，
    照的心里明又亮。
    毛主席著作是指路灯，
    幸福大道照的清，
    共产主义天堂路，
    明灯高挂前面迎。
    珍宝自来最贵重，
    毛主席著作松柏青。
    珍宝永远不生锈，
    毛主席著作永不朽。
    毛主席的大红旗，
    胜利胜利再胜利！
    我们有个毛主席，
    世世代代好福气！
                李增润
    学理论
    方向
    生产战线逞英雄，
    学习理论当闯将，
    身体既要炼成钢，
    思想比钢强上强！
    没有舵轮船难行，
    没有罗盘迷方向，
    学好毛泽东思想，
    黑夜也会出太阳！
    新福音书
    大伯坐在禾塘边，
    手中捧着书一本，
    不是旧约福音书，
    精装“毛选”崭崭新！
    “信了上帝几十年，
    福音书里没福音，
    真正的福音在哪里，
    毛主席著作里面寻！”
            广东台山华侨中学　唐奇
    读毛选
    夜半下工不睡眠，
    挑灯夜战读毛选，
    金鸡高唱东方红，
    眼明心亮干劲添。
          河南开封　李清
