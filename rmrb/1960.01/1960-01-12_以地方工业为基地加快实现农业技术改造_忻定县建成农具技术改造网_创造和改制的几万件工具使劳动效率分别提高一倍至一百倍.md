    Accelerating Agricultural Technological Transformation Based on Local Industry
    Xinding County Establishes Agricultural Tool Technical Transformation Network
    Tens of Thousands of Invented and Modified Tools Increase Labor Efficiency by One to One Hundred Times
    (Reported by our newspaper from Taiyuan on January 11th) Xinding County, Shanxi Province, has achieved significant results by adopting a strategy of vigorously accelerating agricultural technological transformation based on local industry.
    Currently, Xinding County has established a semi-mechanized local industrial system that is beginning to take shape. All twenty people's communes in the county have mechanical factories, and each management district has mechanical repair stations (groups). These factories have played a significant role in agricultural production, construction, and technological transformation, promoting the rapid development of agricultural infrastructure. In the past year alone, various mechanical factories have invented and modified over 27,000 pieces of equipment, including disc harrows, double-bottom plows, walking plows, dredgers, generators, and powered mills, increasing the efficiency of agricultural production and construction by one to one hundred times. In water conservancy projects alone, more than 53,000 labor days were saved throughout the year, equivalent to 44% of the county's total labor force. In addition, 23,950 various vehicles were produced, with over 85% of the vehicles equipped with ball bearings. Last year, the county completed transportation tasks more than twenty days earlier than in previous years.
    After the people's communes were established, in order to accelerate the realization of the goals stipulated in the county's agricultural development plan, the Xinding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party analyzed the basic situation of the county and decided to vigorously develop local industry as a base for agricultural technological transformation. However, Xinding County's local industrial foundation was relatively weak. To adapt to this situation, the Xinding County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that light industry required less investment, yielded faster returns, and produced greater benefits. Moreover, Xinding had established heavy industrial factories such as copper-iron plants and mechanical factories in 1958, creating conditions for the development of light industry. Therefore, it was decided to launch projects using indigenous methods and vigorously develop light industry. In one quarter, four county-run factories were established for papermaking, chemical production, soda ash production, and power equipment repair, while twelve factories, including cotton spinning and non-staple food processing, were expanded. This quickly provided 700,000 yuan in funding, which was first used to equip the county-run mechanical industry. Then, it immediately began to help commune-run industries equip themselves. Since August of last year, county-run industries have provided commune-run industries with more than 120 various machine tools and iron-wood electric saws, electric planers, mortising machines, riveting machines, and drilling machines. They have trained more than 1,600 technicians for the communes and transformed commune-run farm tool repair shops into farm tool machinery manufacturing plants. In this way, the county formed a strong agricultural tool technical transformation network with county-run industry as the backbone and commune-run industry as the foundation. To facilitate the leadership and planned undertaking of various tasks related to agricultural technological transformation, Xinding County-run industries and commune-run industries have divided their labor in this way: county-run industries are mainly responsible for the county's manufacturing and pilot testing of new machines, while commune-run industries are mainly responsible for the county's repair and assembly of agricultural machinery. Due to the clear division of labor and mutual cooperation, agricultural technological transformation has been effectively promoted, ensuring that the repair of water conservancy construction tools and large-scale farm tools does not leave the county, medium-scale repairs do not leave the commune, and small-scale repairs do not leave the district.
    This year, Xinding County has made ambitious plans for arming local industry and supporting agriculture. It plans to build fourteen new factories, including potash fertilizer plants, ceramic factories, small hardware factories, and sugar factories, and expand twenty-four factories this year. It plans to produce 400 horse-drawn wheat harvesters and water pumps each, so that each management district has one to two horse-drawn wheat harvesters and water pumps. It plans to build 150 new small-scale power stations, so that farmland irrigation and drainage machinery and agricultural and sideline product processing are all driven by electricity. In terms of mechanization, it plans to manufacture 150 various machine tools this year, so that each commune-run factory can have five to seven machine tools. In addition, 94 fertilizer plants will be built, striving to apply an average of 70 jin of fertilizer per mu of land this year.

    以地方工业为基地加快实现农业技术改造
    忻定县建成农具技术改造网
    创造和改制的几万件工具使劳动效率分别提高一倍至一百倍
    本报太原11日电　山西省忻定县采取以地方工业为基地，大力加速农业技术改造，已取得了很大的成绩。
    目前，忻定县已经建成一个初具规模的半机械化的地方工业体系。全县二十个人民公社社社有机械厂，每个管理区都有机械修配站（组）。这些工厂在农业生产、建设和技术改造中发挥了很大的作用，促使了农业基本建设得到了飞跃发展。在去年一年中，各个机械厂创制和改制了圆盘耙、双铧犁、步犁、挖泥机、发电机、动力磨共二万七千多件，使农业生产、建设效率提高一倍至一百倍。仅水利工程一项，全年就节省劳动力五万三千多个，等于全县劳力的44％。另外，还生产了各种车辆二万三千九百五十辆，85％以上的车辆都安上了滚珠轴承，去年全县比往年缩短二十多天完成了运输任务。
    人民公社化以后，为加速全县实现农业发展纲要所规定的指标，中共忻定县委分析了全县的基本情况以后，决定大力发展地方工业，以此为基地进行农业技术改造。但是忻定县的地方工业基础比较薄弱，为了适应这种情况，中共忻定县委认为轻工业投资少，收益快，得利多，而且忻定在1958年建立了铜铁厂和机械厂等重工业工厂，为发展轻工业创造了条件，因此，决定土法上马，大办轻工业。在一个季度里，就办起了县营造纸、化工、纯碱、动力修造等四个厂，扩建了棉纱、副食加工等十二个厂。这样，很快提供了七十万元资金，首先装备起县营机械工业。接着又立即动手帮助社营工业进行装备。从去年8月以来，县营工业为公社工业提供了各种车床和铁木制的电锯、电刨、挖槽机、开铆机、钻孔机等一百二十多部，先后为公社培养了技术人员一千六百多名，并把公社农具修配厂改造成为农具机械修造厂。这样，全县以县营工业为骨干，公社工业为基础，形成了一个强大的农具技术改造网。为了便于有领导，有计划地负担农业技术改造的各种任务，忻定县营工业和公社工业进行了这样分工：县营工业主要担负全县制造和新机器试点任务，社营工业主要分担全县农业机械的修配。由于分工明确，协作互助，有力地推动了农业技术改造，作到了水利建设工具、农具大修不出县，中修不出社，小修不出区。
    今年，忻定县在武装地方工业和支援农业方面，又作出了宏伟规划，计划在今年内新建钾肥厂、陶瓷厂、小五金厂、糖厂等十四座，扩建工厂二十四座。计划生产马拉割麦机和水泵各四百部，使每个管理区都有马拉割麦机和水泵一部到二部。计划新建小型发电站一百五十座，做到农田排灌机械和农副产品加工都用电力带动。在机械化方面，今年计划制造各种车床一百五十台，使每个社营工厂能有五台至七台机床。另外，建设化肥厂九十四座，争取今年每亩地平均施七十斤化肥。
