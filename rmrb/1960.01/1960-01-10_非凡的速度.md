Extraordinary Speed
By our reporters Ping Lan, Su Fen

The Tongxing Coal Mine in Qijiang County, Sichuan Province, is like a thriving camellia, blooming on the mountains straddling the Sichuan-Guizhou border.

Under the guidance of the Party's policy of "walking on two legs," this small and unsophisticated coal mine achieved brilliant success in 1959. At the beginning of 1960, it created brand-new achievements again. In the first five days of January, coal production exceeded the production plan by 17.03%.

Before August of last year, the daily coal production of the Tongxing Coal Mine had been hovering around 80 tons. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, it leaped forward with extraordinary speed. The output of raw coal increased month by month, and by December of last year, the monthly output had increased 43 times compared to August, with the highest daily output reaching 8,060 tons. The quality of raw coal also continued to improve, with the sulfur content gradually decreasing from 1% to 0.33%, and the cost per ton decreasing from 3.47 yuan to 0.55 yuan.

Taking the Lead

In just over five months, this mine leaped from a daily output of 80 tons to a daily output of more than 8,000 tons. This is an amazing leap forward, and it fully proves the unlimited power of technological innovation and technological transformation.

After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was announced last year, all the workers of the mine were overjoyed and discussed how to further improve the production of small coal mines. At this time, Yang Ronggui, the secretary of the Party branch, invited the veteran worker Zhou Xianglin and asked, "What should we do to further the Great Leap Forward in our coal mine?" Master Zhou pondered for a while and replied, "Let's put more effort into the work at hand!" Secretary Yang told him, "Of course, we need to put in more effort, but we also need to improve technically!"

After Zhou Xianglin returned home, he didn't sleep well all night. He remembered that in April, he had gone to the neighboring Tonghua Coal Mine to learn from the advanced experience of coal miner Zuo Shaoquan. At that time, he saw Zuo Shaoquan mining 10 to 20 meters of coal at once, and he also tried to do the same when he came back, creating a new record of 24 tons per day. However, due to transportation difficulties at the time, he couldn't transport it out even if he mined more, so he automatically abandoned this good experience. Old Zhou repeatedly thought about this matter, and felt that he had found a treasure and then lost it. The next day, before dawn, he ran down the well and resumed using the longwall mining and multi-tool operation method he had learned from Zuo Shaoquan. On this day, he mined 73 tons of coal in one go. Later, he increased the number of tools he used from two to twenty-three. He also used his brains to change the temporary supports during coal mining to natural coal pillars. As a result, his daily output increased from 73 tons to 454 tons, and in January of this year, he created an amazing record of 514 tons of coal per day.

In order to promote the leap forward in production throughout the mine, the mine's Party branch also adopted the method of organizing visits, mobilizing workers from other wells to visit the second well where Zhou Xianglin was located, so that a high tide of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced quickly formed throughout the mine. A "one-dragon" competition was launched both underground and above ground, promoting the leap forward in production in every well, and the output rose by hundreds and thousands of tons. Now, among the 71 coal miners in the mine, 13 have achieved a daily output of more than 100 tons, and the lowest daily output among all coal miners in the mine has reached more than 20 tons.

Opening the Way

When you walk into the dozens of miles of mountains where the Tongxing Coal Mine is located, you can see groups of people building roads and laying rails everywhere, and the rumbling sound of blasting to open mountains can be heard from time to time. The workers of the Tongxing Coal Mine are opening up transportation routes for the continued leap forward this year. With the improvement of coal mining methods and the continuous increase in the output of raw coal, transportation has become an urgent problem to be solved in the development of coal mine production. The Party branch decided to build tracks to improve transportation capacity. When the masses heard that they were going to engage in transportation, everyone was elated and went to work immediately. In just over six days, they built a light railway with a total length of 2,400 meters. Now, when you walk into the mining area, you can see railways like belts, winding and circling on the mountainside. While strengthening the construction of above-ground transportation, underground construction is also proceeding in a tense and enthusiastic manner. A new roadway, 2.2 meters high and 2 meters wide, has been built, and double-track rails lead directly to the coal mining face. The woodworking shop outside the well is rushing to make coal cars that are more than twice as large as the current ones. … All of this shows that this small coal mine will surely have an even more amazing leap forward.

    非凡的速度
    本报记者　平兰　素芬
    四川省綦江县同兴煤矿像一支茁壮的茶花，盛开在绵延川黔边界的大山上。
    这个又小又土的煤矿，在党的两条腿走路方针的指导下，在1959年取得了辉煌的成就。1960年一开头，又创造了崭新的成绩。1月份的头五天，煤产量超额17．03％完成了生产计划。
    同兴煤矿在去年8月份以前，煤日产量一直停留在八十吨左右。党的八届八中全会以后，便以非凡的速度飞跃前进。原煤产量一月高过一月，到去年12月份，月产量比8月份增加四十三倍，最高日产量达到八千零六十吨。原煤质量也不断提高，含?率由1％逐步降低到0．33％，每吨成本由三元四角七分下降到五角五分。
    一马当先
    只有五个多月时间，这个矿由日产八十吨飞跃到日产八千多吨，这是一个惊人的跃进，也充分地证明了技术革新和技术改造的无限威力。
    去年党的八届八中全会决议公布以后，全矿职工都欢欣鼓舞，纷纷议论要进一步改进小煤矿的生产面貌。这时，党支部书记杨荣贵把老工人周相林请来，问道：“我们煤矿要进一步大跃进，该怎样办？”周师傅沉思了一会儿，答道：“出在手上的活，多加把气力吧！”杨书记告诉他说：“加把气力，那个自然，但是还要多从技术上改进改进！”
    周相林回家以后，一夜没有好好睡觉，想起了4月份他到邻近的同华煤矿去学习采煤工人左绍全的先进经验的事。那时，他看见左绍全一下就采煤一二十米，回来也照着做过，创造了日产二十四吨的新成绩。但是，由于当时运输困难，挖多了运不出去，他就自动把这套好经验丢下了。老周反复地想起这件事，觉得真是自己找了宝来又丢宝。第二天，天不亮他就跑下井去，重新用从左绍全那里学来的长壁式采煤和多工具操作法采煤。这天，他一口气就挖了七十三吨煤。后来，他又将原来采煤时只用两件工具，增加到二十三件，他又动脑筋把采煤时的临时支柱，改为留自然煤柱，因此，日产量又从七十三吨陆续提高到四百五十四吨，今年1月份更创造了日采煤五百一十四吨的惊人成绩。
    为了推动全矿生产跃进，矿党支部还采取了组织参观的办法，发动别的井的工人到周相林所在的二井参观，使全矿很快就形成了一个学先进赶先进的热潮，井下井上都展开了“一条龙”竞赛，促进了井井生产跃进，产量成百上千吨的上升。现在全矿七十一个采煤工中，有十三人日产量已经达到一百吨以上，全矿采煤工人中，最低日产量也达到了二十吨以上。
    开路
    当你走到同兴煤矿连绵几十里的山峦里，到处都可以看到一堆堆的人群在那里筑路、铺轨，不时传来隆隆的放炮开山声。这是同兴煤矿的职工们正在为今年继续跃进开辟运输道路。随着采煤方法的改进，原煤产量的连续上升，运输就成了煤矿生产发展中急需解决的问题。党支部决定修建轨道，提高运输能力。群众一听要搞交通运输，个个兴高采烈，说干就干，在六天多内就修好了全长二千四百米的轻便铁道。现在，当你走进矿区，只见铁道如带，蜿蜒盘旋在大山腰。在加强井外运输建设的同时，井下建设也在紧张热烈地进行。一条二米二高和二米宽的新巷道修起来了，并有双线铁轨直通采煤工作面。井外的木工场正在那里赶制比现在还大一倍多的煤车。……这一切都显示出这个小煤矿一定会有一个更惊人的跃进。
