Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 13th: The hundreds of thousands of steelworkers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, after achieving a flying start in New Year production, are determined to seize another flying start during the Spring Festival and are currently actively engaged in various preparatory tasks.

    Workers from many factories and mines, such as the No. 2 Steel Plant, Casting Pipe Factory, Refractory Materials Factory, and Gongchangling Mine, have recently held symposiums, group meetings, and mobilization rallies. Many people have written letters of determination and drawn up plans to ensure that production during the Spring Festival surpasses that of the New Year and that the January production plan is completed ahead of schedule. Before the New Year, the workers of the Casting Pipe Factory refurbished their equipment. Recently, they have re-inspected the machinery, rushed to manufacture spare parts, and replaced components to prepare for a flying start in Spring Festival production. Workers from units such as Dagushan Mine, the Sintering Plant, and the Transportation Department are actively preparing raw materials for Anshan Iron and Steel's Spring Festival flying start.

    Party committee secretaries and factory directors of factories such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Sintering Plant, Southern Machinery Repair Factory, and the No. 2 Medium Plate Factory have recently visited workers' dormitories to understand their living needs, arrange workers' rest and life during the Spring Festival, prepare cultural and recreational activities, and improve meals so that everyone can enjoy the festival happily.

    Wuhan Factories and Enterprises
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 13th: Factories and enterprises in Wuhan are actively carrying out various preparations for the Spring Festival and the period afterward to ensure a flying start to production during the Spring Festival.

    Workers in the electromechanical industry system have proposed completing the monthly plan six to seven days ahead of schedule and have launched various preparatory tasks centered on this goal. Wuhan Machinery Factory has recently prepared the steel needed before and after the Spring Festival. Hubei Tractor Factory has also prepared a batch of castings, forgings, and other semi-finished products for a flying start after the festival. Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory is also preparing to adjust the production line during the Spring Festival and is currently working on the design. In addition, the electromechanical industry system is also preparing to hold workers' sports meets and cultural performances before the Spring Festival to liven up workers' cultural and recreational life.

    Factories in the textile industry system are currently preparing raw material storage and machine maintenance to ensure daily increases in production before and after the Spring Festival.

    The transportation department is also making arrangements for transportation during the Spring Festival from various aspects. According to the forecast that passenger and freight transport before and after this year's Spring Festival will greatly increase compared to previous years, the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Navigation Administration is arranging to open temporary routes and is actively conducting a major safety inspection of waterways, ships, docks, and passenger stations.

    Hebei Large-Scale Coal Mines
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 12th: After achieving a New Year "flying start," the 25 large-scale coal mines in Hebei Province are grasping current production while actively making preparations to ensure a "flying start" in Spring Festival production.

    Preparing sufficient working faces for the extraction workers is an important guarantee for achieving a flying start during the Spring Festival. The 25 large-scale coal mines have put forward the advanced target of "100 meters per month for rock roadways and 200 meters per month for semi-coal roadways" and are vigorously promoting advanced experiences such as long-drill drilling and deep-hole blasting to accelerate the rate of excavation.

    The mine's electrical and mechanical maintenance workers have now completed the maintenance tasks of key projects and have switched to daily maintenance work. Their slogan is: "Ensure that the mine's mechanical and electrical equipment operates safely during the Spring Festival."

    In order to allow workers to enjoy the Spring Festival happily without delaying production, the mines are actively arranging Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities. Amateur cultural troupes and film projection teams have prepared many exciting programs for the miners so they can enjoy the Spring Festival in addition to their work.

    Shanghai Machine Tool Factory
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 13th: According to the spirit of "getting an early start and striving for initiative," the workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory are concentrating on key aspects of production, striving to complete January's production tasks ahead of the Spring Festival and to process parts for February's products to ensure a flying start after the festival. Their slogan is: "Don't slacken before and after the Spring Festival, and enjoy the festival with a happy mood."

    Currently, workers throughout the factory are concentrating on important issues such as insufficient large-part processing capacity, inadequate supply of large castings, and heavy new product trial production tasks. When the capacity of gantry planers for processing large parts is insufficient, they widen and lengthen existing gantry planers to tap their potential. The No. 3 Workshop originally could only plane one grinding machine bed on a gantry planer each time. After the workers lengthened its table, they could plane two beds. Recently, they widened its gantry so it can plane four beds at a time. The bed of one type of grinding machine is relatively wide. The No. 2 Workshop originally processed it on a large 10-meter gantry planer. Now, they are modifying a 3-meter gantry planer to take over this task and allow the large planer to play a greater role.

    A communist collaboration movement is underway throughout the factory to help the No. 2 Workshop, which has the heaviest production tasks. Departments such as the hydraulic workshop have transferred a group of workers to support them. Some machine tools in the repair workshop are also being used by workers from the No. 2 Workshop. Within the No. 2 Workshop, some groups are squeezing out manpower to support groups with more urgent tasks. Within a group, machine tools are also collaborating; small lathes are undertaking some of the tasks of large lathes through innovation to support large lathes.

    To prepare for future production, more than 20 purchasing personnel dispatched by the management department are solving the material needs of the factory in other regions. Since December 29th of last year, maintenance workers have repaired more than 150 machines and pieces of equipment; they plan to repair another 140 by the Spring Festival.

    The factory's leaders also plan to visit workers during the Spring Festival to extend New Year greetings. Cultural and recreational activities before and after the Spring Festival have also been arranged so that workers can enjoy the festival happily. The workers are also preparing to use the Spring Festival holiday to hold a worker-peasant get-together at the Maqiao People's Commune.

    Tianjin Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 13th: The workers of Tianjin Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, an advanced collective that attended the National Congress of Heroes, after achieving an overall leap forward with daily increases in production in the first ten days of January, have launched a "production technology selection contest" centered on ensuring the early completion of the January plan and preparing for a flying start to the Spring Festival.

    Currently, all departments throughout the factory have drawn up specific guarantee conditions for "striving to be champions" and "striving to be experts." The silk workshop has already arranged the variety production plan for after the Spring Festival. The workers who are rushing to install the washing machine equipment have advanced the task originally scheduled for February to ensure that all installations are completed by the 20th of this month, so that the washing machine can be put into production as soon as work resumes after the Spring Festival. Maintenance and preservation workers have also made detailed divisions of labor according to the machines, using all machine downtime for maintenance to ensure that there are no "sick" machines after the Spring Festival.

    Office staff are also making preparations in advance. The factory's production plan for after the festival has now been arranged, and there is a full guarantee of raw material reserves.

    Chongqing Changan Machinery Factory
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 13th: On the basis of achieving a flying start in the first ten days of January, the workers of Chongqing Changan Machinery Factory are actively carrying out Spring Festival production preparations. They have proposed not only to over fulfill the January plan ahead of schedule and celebrate the festival with joy, but also to achieve a flying start during the Spring Festival.

    The production plan for February after the Spring Festival has now been drawn up, requiring an increase in output value of about 15% compared to January. The technical data required for all 24 major products throughout the month has been distributed to the workshops. The "major investigation" movement carried out by workers throughout the factory has identified more than 13,000 major and minor key issues related to material supply and equipment maintenance, of which more than 9,700 have been solved by the collective wisdom and strength of all workers. Now, most of the various technical data, tools, raw materials, and fuels required for February have been prepared. More than 20% of the various accessories needed for February have been manufactured and can all be prepared before the Spring Festival.

    The workers of the whole factory also launched a technological innovation and technological revolution movement of "everyone engaging in improvement and everyone engaging in five-izations." The five-izations are: increasing the power of large machine tools, increasing the speed of small and medium-sized machine tools, mechanizing manual operations, automating single-machine production, and linking batch product production. In the first eleven days of January, the factory realized more than 70,000 innovation proposals, created two production linkage lines for winding springs and cutting springs, automated 15 machine tools, and transformed more than 1,600 manual operations into mechanized production. These technological innovation achievements have created favorable conditions for achieving a flying start during the Spring Festival.

    The factory's production in the first ten days of January was excellent. By the 11th, the total output value had completed 44.8% of the entire month's plan, an increase of 28% compared to the same period in December last year. At the same time, changing the past habit of not producing products during the New Year, a batch of products such as automobiles and lathes were assembled.
