    Stand Up, Advance More Bravely!
    [To the heroic Japanese people who oppose the US-Japan military alliance]
    The American imperialists and Nobusuke Kishi have set a sinister trap, and the shadow of war is approaching the doorstep of Japan step by step. One US military base after another is being set up on Japanese soil, and war maniacs want to use Japan as a wheel for their atomic cannons. The Wall Street arms dealers are dreaming foolish dreams—using the blood and land of the Japanese people to exchange for huge profits. The American imperialists are secretly calculating day and night—one day arbitrarily wielding the whip and driving the Japanese people to "advance west" and "advance north"... (Note) The land of Japan is groaning under the iron hooves of American beasts, and the dignity and civilization of the Japanese people are being insulted and trampled upon. How many people who have lost their husbands, wives, and children are still weeping... The disaster left by Hiroshima is still fresh in people's minds. "We cannot live like this! We cannot live like this!" The awakened Japanese people are uttering magnificent roars: Stand up!—Struggle! Unite! Unite! Struggle! "Down with the traitorous reactionaries! Eliminate the roots of militarism!" Wave after wave rises higher, conducting ten, a hundred, a thousand struggles! Millions of fists are like a forest of steel, and the roars of millions of people are shaking Tokyo—Washington. Mount Fuji is spewing out the raging fire of hatred, and the angry tides of the Sea of Japan are surging and rolling. Stand up! Advance more bravely! Drive away the evil eagles cloaked in the feathers of doves! Heroic fighters, you are not alone; standing with you are peace-loving people all over the world.
    [Note] According to Akahata, Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama said in response to a question at a Diet meeting that after the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," the US military would be able to use Japan as a base to move towards the coastal areas of China, Korea, and the coastal areas of the Soviet Union.

    站起来，更勇敢地前进！
    〔给英勇反对日美军事同盟的日本人民〕
    海稜美国佬和岸信介设下了一个罪恶的陷阱，战争的魔影在一步一步地迫近日本家门。日本国土上摆下一个又一个的美军基地，战争狂人要把日本当成原子大炮的车轮。华尔街的军火巨商正在做着蠢梦——要拿日本人民的鲜血和江山去换取高额利润。美国佬日日夜夜在暗中打着如意算盘——有一天任意挥鞭着日本人民“西进”“北进”……（注）日本的土地在美国兽兵的铁蹄下呻吟，日本人民的尊严和文明受到污辱和蹂躏。多少失掉丈夫妻子儿女的人还在悲泣……广岛留下的灾难人们记忆犹新。“不能这样活下去！不能这样活下去！”觉醒的日本人民发出雄壮的吼声，站起来！——斗争！团结！团结！斗争！“打倒卖国贼反动派！消灭军国主义的祸根！”一浪高过一浪，十次、百次、千次的进行斗争！千万个拳头像钢铁的森林，千万人的吼声震撼东京——华盛顿。富士山在喷吐着仇恨的烈火，日本海的怒潮在汹涌滚腾。站起来！更勇敢地前进！赶走披着鸽子羽毛的罪恶凶鹰！英勇的战斗者啊，你们不是孤单的，站在你们一起的有着全世界爱好和平的人民。〔注〕据赤旗报揭露：日本外务相藤山在国会会议上答
      复质问时曾说，美日“安全条约”修改后，美军
      能够以日本为基地向中国沿海地带、朝鲜和苏联
      滨海边区出动。
