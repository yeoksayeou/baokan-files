Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: Communist Party leaders and leading party organs of many European countries issued statements and articles for the New Year, congratulating the people of the world on the great victories achieved in the cause of defending peace in 1959, and at the same time calling on the people of all countries to continue the struggle in the New Year against the Cold War activities of the imperialist bloc and to make contributions to further defending peace.

French Communist Party Secretary Duclos published an article in "l'Humanité" saying that 1959 was the year Soviet scientists launched the first cosmic rocket, lunar rocket, and interplanetary station. The past year has vividly demonstrated the achievements of Soviet science and convincingly confirmed the superiority of socialism over capitalism. Duclos pointed out that due to the continuous growth of the strength of socialist countries, achievements were made in easing international tensions in 1959. In the last few days of last year, an agreement was reached to hold a summit meeting between the East and the West in May this year, which will be one of the most important events in 1960.

Duclos spoke about Khrushchev's visit to France in March this year. Duclos said, "If the defenders of the Cold War do not like this, then the French people clearly know that this visit will help the cause of peace."

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany issued a New Year's message through the "German 904 Free Radio Station". The message emphasized that the struggle for peace and freedom requires the restoration of the legal status of the Communist Party of Germany.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany extended warm congratulations to those who are currently imprisoned in West German prisons for actively striving for peace, democracy, and social progress, and extended warm congratulations to the warriors who are heroically fighting for the cause of the working class and the German people.

In his New Year's message broadcast by the "German 904 Free Radio Station" on New Year's Eve of 1959, Ernst Thälmann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, emphasized that the imperialist and militarist policies pursued by the West German ruling clique will once again lead the German people to disaster. Therefore, all peace-loving people must unite to strive to shift West Germany's policies towards the direction of peace.

Norwegian Communist Party Chairman Løvlien pointed out in a New Year's conversation with reporters from "Friheten" that 1959 was a year of easing international tensions. But this does not mean that peace has been guaranteed. Those who advocate continuing the Cold War are interested in maintaining tensions. For them, easing tensions means reducing armed forces, losing profits, and causing crises. Therefore, they openly demand the continuation of the arms race.

Løvlien demanded that the Norwegian authorities completely abandon the North Atlantic Treaty Organization policy. He believes that this will be one of Norway's most effective contributions to easing tensions.

Løvlien refuted the assertion by the reactionary group in Norway that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are a threat to Norway. He said that it is precisely the socialist countries that desire peace, because peace is a prerequisite for the rapid construction of socialism and communism.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Finland issued a New Year's message saying that the beginning of 1960 has encouraging prospects. Human history has entered the dawn of an era in which it is possible to overwhelm the forces of war and ensure peace. The possibility of guaranteeing human rights is greater than ever before. However, large financial groups in some capitalist countries oppose peace and progress, control the economic life of the country, hold state power, and oppress working people. Therefore, the interests of all working people are consistent. The Central Committee called on everyone to work together to strive to achieve social demands and defend peace. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Finland extended congratulations to the people of the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries, as well as the working people of all countries who are fighting for peace and socialism.

Danish Communist Party Chairman Knud Jespersen published a New Year's speech in the Danish Communist Party's newspaper "Land og Folk". Jespersen said that in the past year, the offensive launched by the forces of peace has clearly been victorious. He pointed out that the current struggle against the Cold War, the arms race, and the hydrogen bomb has taken on a new scale.

Jespersen continued, the Danish people should, together with the people of other countries in the world, promote the East-West summit to help consolidate peace and peaceful coexistence, help ease international tensions, and ensure lasting peace through comprehensive and thorough disarmament.

    欧洲一些国家共产党发表新年祝词
    保卫和平的斗争前景很好
    号召各国人民继续反对帝国主义集团的冷战活动
    据新华社3日讯　欧洲许多国家共产党领袖和党的领导机构在新年发表谈话和文章，祝贺世界人民1959年在保卫和平事业方面所取得的伟大胜利，同时号召各国人民在新的一年中继续进行斗争反对帝国主义集团的冷战活动，为进一步保卫和平作出贡献。
    法国共产党书记杜克洛　在“人道报”上发表文章说，1959年是苏联科学家发射第一个宇宙火箭、月球火箭和行星际站的一年。过去一年鲜明地显示了苏联科学的成就，并且令人信服地证实了社会主义对资本主义的优越性。杜克洛指出，由于社会主义国家力量的不断增长1959年在缓和国际紧张局势方面取得了成就。去年的最后几天达成了在今年5月间召开东西方最高级会议的协议，这个会议将是1960年最重大的事件之一。
    杜克洛谈到赫鲁晓夫今年3月间将访问法国一事。杜克洛说，“如果冷战的捍卫者不喜欢这件事的话，那么，法国人民清楚地知道，这次访问将有助于和平事业”。
    德国共产党中央委员会通过“德国九○四自由广播电台”发表新年文告。文告强调指出，争取和平与自由的斗争要求恢复德国共产党的合法地位。
    德国共产党中央委员会向目前正被关在西德监狱中的积极争取和平、民主和社会进步的人士表示热烈祝贺，向为工人阶级和德国人民的事业而英勇斗争的战士表示热烈祝贺。
    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼1959年除夕在“德国九○四自由广播电台”发表的新年祝词中强调指出，西德统治集团奉行的帝国主义和军国主义政策将把德国人民再度导向浩劫。因此，一切爱好和平的人民必须团结起来，争取使西德的政策向和平的方向转变。
    挪威共产党主席洛夫林在对“自由报”记者发表新年谈话时指出，1959年是国际紧张局势取得缓和的一年。但是这并不意味着和平已经得到保证。主张继续进行冷战的人对保持紧张局势感到兴趣。对他们来说，缓和紧张局势意味着减少武装部队、失去利润和发生危机。因此，他们公开地要求继续进行军备竞赛。
    洛夫林要求挪威当局彻底抛弃北大西洋集团政策。他认为这将是挪威对缓和紧张局势的一个最有效的贡献。
    洛夫林驳斥挪威反动集团这样一种说法，好像苏联和其他社会主义国家是对挪威的一个威胁。他说，恰恰是社会主义国家希望和平，因为和平对迅速建设社会主义和共产主义来说是一个先决条件。
    芬兰共产党中央委员会发表新年祝词说，1960年的开端是有着令人鼓舞的前景的。人类历史已经进入有可能压倒战争势力和确保和平的黎明时代。保障人权的可能性比过去任何时候都大。但是，在一些资本主义国家里的大财阀集团反对和平与进步，控制着国家的经济生活，掌握着国家大权，压迫劳动人民。因此，全体劳动人民的利益是一致的。中央委员会号召齐心协力争取实现社会要求，保卫和平。芬共中央委员会向苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家的人民，以及正在为争取和平与社会主义而斗争的各国劳动人民表示祝贺。
    丹麦共产党主席克努德·耶斯佩森　在丹共机关报“国土与人民报”上发表新年谈话。耶斯佩森说，在过去一年中，和平力量展开的进攻显然是胜利的。他指出，目前反对冷战、反对军备竞赛和氢弹的斗争具有了新的规模。
    耶斯佩森继续说，丹麦人民应当同世界其他国家的人民一道，促使东西方最高级会议有助于巩固和平与和平共处，有助于缓和国际紧张局势并通过全面、彻底的裁军，保障持久和平。
