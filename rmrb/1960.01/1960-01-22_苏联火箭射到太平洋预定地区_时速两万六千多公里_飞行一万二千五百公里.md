Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 21st. TASS Moscow, January 21st: On the evening of January 20th (Wednesday), the Soviet Union launched a multi-stage ballistic rocket into the Pacific region. This is the first of a series of launches planned as part of a project to create more powerful multi-stage ballistic rockets to launch heavy Earth satellites and achieve cosmic flights to planets in the solar system.

The penultimate stage of this rocket, together with a model of the final stage, accurately followed the calculated trajectory, reaching a speed of over 26,000 kilometers per hour, and arrived at the predetermined area in the Pacific waters at 20:05 Moscow time on January 20th. This area is approximately 12,500 kilometers from the launch point (along the Earth's surface).

After completing its task, the penultimate stage of the rocket entered the dense atmosphere at an altitude of 80 to 90 kilometers, where it was destroyed and partially burned during continued operation.

The model of the final stage of the rocket, adapted to pass through the dense atmosphere, reached the water surface near the intended point of descent.

A Soviet specialized fleet in the rocket's intended impact area conducted valuable long-range measurements of the descending branch of the flight trajectory.

The behavior of the final stage model of the rocket during its flight in the atmosphere was observed, and its entry into the water was recorded by shipboard radio location stations, optical stations, and acoustic signal stations.

According to the data obtained from the measurements, the rocket's landing point deviated from the predetermined landing point by less than two kilometers, which confirms the high accuracy of the rocket's control system.

The rocket was launched at a precisely determined time. The entire rocket's flight and the activity of each of its stages conformed to the original plan.

The measurement systems and equipment installed on the rocket ensured the transmission of necessary data to ground stations and ship stations throughout the flight.

During the rocket's flight, the operation of certain scientific instruments was also tested, and necessary measurements were taken.

In order to further accumulate experimental data, powerful multi-stage ballistic rockets will continue to be tested. The rockets will land in the area announced in the TASS communiqué of January 8, 1960.

The successful launch of the powerful Soviet multi-stage ballistic rocket guarantees that Soviet science will move further along the path of conquering outer space and exploring the planets of the solar system.

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st. The news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of its first powerful test rocket into the Pacific Ocean has excited scientists in the capital.

The famous mechanician Qian Xuesen told reporters tonight that the successful launch of this powerful Soviet rocket shows that Soviet rocket technology has reached a new peak.

Qian Xuesen believes that this rocket launch has two characteristics: First, its speed accuracy exceeds that of the lunar rocket launched last time. The speed accuracy of the rocket hitting the moon only needed to be one in ten thousand, while the speed accuracy of this rocket reached less than one in twelve thousand (i.e., the error is less than 0.6 meters per second).

Second, the heaviest artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union in the past weighed more than 1,300 kilograms, and the total thrust of the rocket was about 500 tons. This level has already far exceeded that of the United States. And the thrust of this rocket is estimated to be much greater, enough to launch more significant artificial satellites.

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st. TASS, January 21st: The TASS announcement of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a ballistic rocket has aroused great interest throughout the world.

Many major radio stations immediately broadcast the news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a multi-stage ballistic rocket into the Pacific region in the form of breaking news just ten minutes later.

    苏联火箭射到太平洋预定地区
    时速两万六千多公里  飞行一万二千五百公里
    新华社莫斯科21日电　塔斯社莫斯科21日电：1月20日（星期三）晚间在苏联向太平洋地区发射了一个多级弹道火箭。这是预定一系列发射中的第一次发射，这一系列发射是根据制造威力更大的多级弹道火箭来发射重型地球卫星和实现向太阳系行星的宇宙飞行的计划进行的。
    这个火箭的倒数第二级连同最后一级的模型一起，准确地沿着计算轨道运行，达到每小时两万六千多公里的速度，在1月20日莫斯科时间二十点五分到达太平洋水域的预定地区，这个地区离发射点约一万二千五百公里（沿地球表面）。
    火箭的倒数第二级完成了自己的任务后，进入八十公里至九十公里高空的稠密大气层，在继续运行中破坏，并部分烧毁。
    适应于通过稠密大气层的火箭最后一级的模型，达到了预定下落点附近的水面。
    在火箭预定下落区域的苏联专门船队，对飞行轨道的下降支线进行了有价值的远距离测量。
    火箭最后一级的模型在大气中飞行时的情况已经观测到了，它在落入水中时的情况已由船上的无线电定位站、光学站和音响讯号站记录下来了。
    根据所进行的测量的数据，确定了火箭降落点偏离预定降落点不到二公里，这就证实了火箭控制系统的高度准确性。
    火箭是在精确地确定的时间发射的。整个火箭的飞行及其各级的活动符合原定的计划。
    装在火箭上的测量系统和设备，在飞行的全程上保证了向地面站和船上站发送必要的资料。
    在火箭飞行的过程中，还检验了某些科学仪器的工作，并且进行了必要的测量。
    为了进一步积累试验资料，将继续试验威力强大的多级弹道火箭。火箭将下落在塔斯社1960年1月8日公报所宣布的区域内。
    威力强大的苏联多级弹道火箭的成功发射，保证苏联科学沿着征服宇宙空间和研究太阳系行星的道路进一步向前迈进。
    新华社21日讯　苏联向太平洋成功地发射了第一个强大试验火箭的消息振奋了首都的科学家。
    著名力学家钱学森今晚对记者说，从苏联这次强大火箭的发射成功，可以看到苏联现在的火箭技术又达到了新的高峰。
    钱学森认为这次火箭的发射有两个特点：第一，它的速度的准确率超过了上次射中月球的那一枚宇宙火箭。射中月球的火箭的速度准确率只需万分之一就够了，这次火箭的速度准确率达到一万二千分之一以下（即每秒误差不到零点六米）。
    第二，过去苏联发射过的最重的人造卫星是一千三百多公斤，火箭总推力大约要五百吨；这个水平已经远远超过了美国。而这次火箭的推力估计还要大得多，足够发射更重大的人造卫星。
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社21日电：塔斯社发布的苏联成功地发射弹道火箭的消息在全世界引起了巨大的兴趣。
    十分钟之后许多大电台都立即以急讯方式播送了苏联成功地向太平洋地区发射多级弹道火箭的消息。
