    Prague, January 1st (by our correspondent Yang Yi) – The working people of Czechoslovakia, who achieved significant victories on the production front in 1959, are greeting the arrival of 1960 with joy and excitement. On the eve of the New Year, they expressed their aspirations to continue moving forward in the new year to reporters.
    Bahali, the leader of a welding team at the "Guangming Electric" factory in Czechoslovakia, which was awarded the title of "Socialist Labor Team," told reporters about their plan for 1960. He said that all the comrades in his team unanimously guarantee to continue to maintain the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team" in the new year. They will not only excellently complete the production tasks but also take the lead in promoting advanced technology and experience. To improve labor productivity, all team members decided that each person should master two technologies this year. Bahali said that in order to accelerate the growth of agricultural production, all the comrades in the team will actively assist the production of the agricultural production cooperative near the factory.
    In the famous Pilsen Second Machine Manufacturing Factory, a team led by Shkastny was awarded the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team" in 1959 for their excellent production achievements and their exemplary actions in helping young workers master technology. They stated that they would better complete production tasks in 1960 and continue to strengthen the training and education of young workers. The team also guaranteed to help other teams striving for the "Socialist Labor Team" to obtain this glorious title, and to quickly bring those collectives that have not yet participated in this competition into this movement.
    The Czechoslovak labor heroes who spoke with reporters all expressed their New Year's greetings to the Chinese working people, wishing them greater achievements in 1960.
