New "Little Cowherd"
Yi Heyuan (lyrics), Sun Shaoqing (photography)

	The sun is red and bright, the scenery in the fields is fresh,
	Birds sing on the branches, mountain songs echo in the sky,
	People are all over the fields, working happily,
	The spring scenery is infinitely good, let’s play the flute for a while.

	(Spoken): I am Sanmao, the little feeder of the commune. Team leader Wang of the production team praised me for being young but ambitious and full of energy, asking me to herd the pigs. I am so happy that the weather is clear and the sun is shining today, so I can't help but drive the pigs to the grassland to graze. Look at these pigs, each shaking their heads and wagging their tails, grunting and chirping, how happy! Wait for me to ride on the pig's back and sing the mountain songs.

	The people's commune is established, and the flowers of happiness bloom,
	The flowers of happiness bloom,
	Myriad purples and thousands of reds, flowers like the sea.
	The "five-in-one" method is good,
	Production and life are cleverly arranged.
	Overcome disasters and celebrate a bumper harvest,
	Happy songs fly beyond the sky.
	The people's commune is good,
	The flowers never fade.
	The seeds of happiness are planted by the Party,
	Only with the Party can we have happiness!

	The commune canteen sends up smoke,
	Sends up smoke,
	Thick smoke curls up into the sky.
	Skillful hands cook meals for thousands of families,
	Sweet and fragrant, we eat happily.
	Focus on production wholeheartedly,
	Put down the heavy burden,
	Women are liberated,
	No longer revolving around the stove,
	This is really convenient!

	The elderly are happy in the house of happiness,
	The elderly are happy,
	Each and every one is truly happy.
	Here, they play chess in pairs,
	There, they drink tea, read newspapers, look at pictures, and chat about their families, living happily. No one cared about them in the old society, but now the evening years are really good, so happy that they sing in their dreams!

	Riding on the pig's back, use your eyes to look, use your eyes to look!
	The kindergarten is so lively.
	Every one is a good baby,
	Fair-skinned, chubby, and smiling.
	This one sings, that one dances;
	This one wants the nanny to kiss, that one wants the nanny to hug,
	What a moving picture, hard to depict!

	The reservoir is deep and blue,
	Deep and blue,
	The clear water reflects the blue sky.
	Fish leap and frolic on the water,
	Sometimes up, sometimes down, like arrows.
	Build water conservancy to ensure high yields,
	Not afraid of floods, not afraid of drought,
	Heroes have shed their sweat,
	To build a reservoir is not simple,
	This is called having great ambitions to conquer nature.

	The motor hums and turns happily,
	Turns happily,
	The commune also runs factories.
	Manufacture agricultural tools with great effort,
	Repair machines ourselves.
	Not afraid of machines breaking down, not afraid of lacking parts,
	Now farmers become workers,
	Red hearts and skillful hands, so many heroes,
	Determined to climb to the peak!

	The livestock farm has beautiful scenery,
	Beautiful scenery,
	Livestock flourishes unusually.
	There are many pigs, cattle, horses, and chickens,
	And thousands of big antelopes.
	Now I herd the pigs,
	And I can't help but feel happy.
	The pigs grow fat, the pigs grow strong,
	I am determined to be a model!

	The sound of reading wafts outwards,
	Wafts outwards,
	The spare-time school is so lively.
	This one is writing,
	That one is calculating a problem;
	This one's hair is all white,
	That one's beard is turned up.
	You have high energy, he has high energy,
	Determined to remove the label of illiteracy.

	Gongs and drums beat in bursts,
	Beat in bursts,
	Laughter is loud in the club.
	The commune actors are artistically good,
	Singing and dancing lightly, truly wonderful!
	You watch attentively, he watches attentively;
	Some are shouting praises, some are applauding and laughing,
	Laughter makes you forget fatigue!

	(Spoken): The mountain songs are sung with great excitement, time flies like an arrow. Seeing that the sun is setting in the west and it is getting late, I have to drive the pigs back to the pen. It is true: The commune is so splendid, the benefits can't be sung enough, singing from morning to night, there are still tens of thousands!

    新“小放牛”
    易和元 词  孙绍卿 摄影
    太阳红艳艳，田野景色鲜，
    小鸟枝头唱，山歌响连天，
    地里人一片，活儿干的欢，
    春光无限好，笛儿吹一番。
      （白）：我，公社小饲养员三毛的便是。生产队王队长夸我人小志高，干劲不凡，叫我放牧猪群。且喜今日天气晴和，阳光灿烂，不免将猪儿赶到草地放牧一回。你看这些猪儿，个个摇头摆尾，哼哼唧唧，好不欢乐！待我骑上猪背也将山歌唱起来。
    公社成立幸福花儿开，
    幸福花儿开，
    万紫千红花如海。
    五位一体办法好，
    生产生活巧安排。
    战胜灾害庆丰收，
    愉快歌声飞天外。
    人民公社好，
    鲜花开不败。
    幸福种子党来栽，
    有党才有幸福来！
    公社食堂冒炊烟，
    冒炊烟呀，
    浓烟袅袅飞上天。
    巧手煮出千家饭，
    又甜又香吃的欢。
    全心搞生产，
    放下千斤担，
    妇女得解放，
    不绕锅台转，
  这一来真是叫方便！
    幸福院里老人乐，
    老人乐呀，
    一个一个真快活。
    这里双双把棋下，
    那里在把茶来喝，读报看画摆家常，欢天喜地过生活。旧社会里没人管，而今晚景真不错，乐得人梦里在唱歌！骑在猪背用眼儿瞧，用眼儿瞧！幼儿园里好热闹。个个都是好宝宝，又白又胖迷迷笑。这个把歌唱，那个把舞跳；这个要阿姨亲，那个要阿姨抱，好一幅动人图景难画描！水库深深一片蓝，一片蓝呀，清清的水波映蓝天。鱼儿欢腾跳水面，忽上忽下箭一般。兴修水利保丰产，不怕洪来不怕干，英雄曾流身身汗，修成水库不简单，这叫做人立大志能胜天。马达呼呼转得欢，转得欢呀，公社也把工厂办。制造农具苦钻研，修理机器自家干。不怕机器坏，不怕缺零件，而今农民变工人，心红手巧多好汉，一心呀要把高峰攀！畜牧场里好风光，好风光呀，六畜兴旺不寻常。猪牛马鸡样样多，还有千只大羚羊。而今我把猪来放，不由心里喜洋洋。猪儿长得胖，猪儿长得壮，下决心我要把模范当！书声朗朗往外飘，往外飘呀，业余学校好热闹。这个在把笔杆摇，那个在算题一道；这个头发都白了，那个胡子往上翘。你也劲头高，他也劲头高，一心要摘掉文盲帽。锣儿鼓儿阵阵敲，阵阵敲呀，俱乐部里笑声高。公社演员艺术好，轻歌曼舞真奇妙！你也用心瞧，他也用心瞧；有的在叫好，有的鼓掌笑，笑声里忘记了疲劳！
  （白）：山歌唱得高了兴，光阴似箭不留停。眼看日落西山，天色不早，我得把猪群赶回圈去。正是：公社多灿烂，好处唱不完，从早唱到夜，还有万万千！
