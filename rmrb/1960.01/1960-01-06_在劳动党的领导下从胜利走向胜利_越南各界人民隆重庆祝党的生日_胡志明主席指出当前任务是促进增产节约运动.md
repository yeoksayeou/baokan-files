Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 5th. More than eight thousand representatives from all walks of life in Vietnam held a grand meeting at the People's Theater tonight to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Labor Party.

    President Ho Chi Minh attended the meeting. Also present were many high-ranking officials from the Vietnam Labor Party, the government, and the People's Army, as well as heads of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and foreign diplomatic envoys to Vietnam.

    President Ho Chi Minh first addressed the meeting amidst thunderous applause.

    President Ho Chi Minh first, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, expressed praise and gratitude for the recent actions of people from all walks of life in North and South Vietnam who actively participated in competitions and strived to achieve results to present to the Party.

    President Ho also extended his warmest greetings to the compatriots in South Vietnam on behalf of the Labor Party Central Committee. He said that although the just struggle of the South Vietnamese compatriots is a long and arduous one, it will surely be victorious.

    President Ho said that with the most humble spirit of revolutionaries, we still have the right to say that our Party is indeed a great Party. He said that our Party has no other interests besides the interests of the class, the people, and the nation.

    President Ho said that our Party raised the banner of revolution as soon as it was founded, uniting and leading the entire Vietnamese people in the struggle for national liberation and class liberation. The light of the Party's red flag is like the rising sun, dispelling the darkness and pointing out a steady path to victory in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution for the Vietnamese people.

    President Ho said that in the fifteen years of struggle before the August Revolution and the eight or nine years of the War of Resistance, many outstanding Party members and revolutionary masses sacrificed themselves heroically for the people and for the Party. Fourteen comrades from the Party Central Committee were shot, beheaded, or beaten to death in prison by French imperialism. The blood of these martyrs dyed the revolutionary flag red, and their heroic sacrifices created conditions for the motherland to bloom with the flowers of independence and bear the fruits of freedom. The Vietnamese people will remember the merits of the martyrs for generations to come and constantly learn from their courageous spirit to overcome all hardships and difficulties and complete the revolutionary cause left to us by the martyrs.

    President Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the Party's current task is to lead the people to promote the competition movement for increasing production and practicing thrift, to build socialism in North Vietnam, and to make North Vietnam a solid foundation for the struggle to achieve the reunification of the motherland. He said that the good results of the competition movement to offer gifts to the Party have proven that the Vietnamese people have very rich and great creativity and strength. President Ho said that at the time of the August Uprising in 1945, the Party had only nearly five thousand members. At that time, the Party was able to lead the people of the whole country to victoriously carry out the August Revolution. Today, the Party's ranks have increased nearly a hundredfold, to about five hundred thousand members. In addition, we have more than six hundred thousand members of the Labor Youth League. Our people's regime has been consolidated, and the People's Army and intellectuals have been tempered, tested, and are constantly progressing. He pointed out that our strength is powerful and is becoming increasingly powerful. Under the wise leadership of the Labor Party, the cause of socialist construction in Vietnam will surely succeed, the struggle to achieve national reunification will surely be victorious, and we will make due contributions to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

    President Ho finally shouted: "Long live the great Vietnam Labor Party!" "Long live peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam!" "Long live the socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union!" "Long live communism!" "Long live world peace!"

    President Ho Chi Minh then recited a poem at the meeting in praise of the Vietnam Labor Party.

    After representatives of ethnic groups, women, and children presented flowers to the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee headed by President Ho, Comrade Truong Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Vietnam Labor Party Central Committee, delivered a long report to the meeting.

    Comrade Truong Chinh outlined the glorious history of struggle of the Vietnam Labor Party in the thirty years since its founding, the brilliant achievements made by the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the Party, and the current tasks of Vietnamese labor and the Vietnamese people. Truong Chinh said, "Under the correct leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party, the Vietnamese people have advanced from victory to victory and will achieve even greater victories."

    Comrade Hoang Quoc Viet then read out the congratulatory messages from fraternal parties of various countries to the Vietnam Labor Party.

    Subsequently, Mr. Bui Ky, 71, representative of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, and Nghiem Xuan Yem, representative of the Vietnam Democratic Party, and Nguyen Xien, representative of the Socialist Party, delivered speeches successively, extending warm congratulations to the Labor Party. Representatives of the Fatherland Front, the Democratic Party, and the Socialist Party presented banners to President Ho Chi Minh to be given to the Vietnam Labor Party.

    The banner presented by the Fatherland Front read: "The people of the whole country unite around the Vietnam Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh." The Democratic Party's banner read: "Single-mindedly follow the Party"; the Socialist Party's banner read: "Heartfelt thanks to the working class and the leadership party."

    The meeting finally ended with shouts of "Long live the Vietnam Labor Party!" "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!" and other slogans.

    胡志明主席指出当前任务是促进增产节约运动
    新华社河内5日电　越南各界人民的代表八千多人今天晚上在人民剧场举行隆重的集会，庆祝越南劳动党成立三十周年。
    胡志明主席出席了大会。出席大会的还有越南劳动党、政府、人民军的许多高级负责人，各民主党派、人民团体的负责人和各国驻越南的外交使节。
    胡志明主席在雷鸣般的掌声中首先向大会致词。
    胡志明主席首先代表党中央对最近以来越南北方各界人民积极参加竞赛、争取成绩向党献礼的行动，表示赞扬和感谢。
    胡主席还代表劳动党中央向南越同胞致以最亲切的敬意。他说，南越同胞的正义斗争虽然是长期和艰苦的斗争，但是它一定会获得胜利。
    胡主席说，本着革命者的最谦虚的精神，我们仍然有权利说，我们的党实在是伟大的党。他说，我们的党除了阶级、人民、民族的利益以外，没有任何其他利益。
    胡主席说，我们的党刚刚成立就高举起革命的旗帜，团结并领导越南全体人民进行民族解放、阶级解放的斗争。党的红旗的光芒有如旭日初升，揭开了夜幕，给越南人民指出了稳步走向反帝反封建革命的胜利的道路。
    胡主席说，在八月革命以前的十五年斗争中和八、九年抗战的时间里，多少优秀党员和革命群众为了人民、为了党而无比壮烈地牺牲了。党的中央委员就有十四位同志被法帝国主义枪杀、砍头或者被打死在监牢里。这些烈士们的鲜血染红了革命的旗帜，烈士们的英勇牺牲为祖国开独立之花、结自由之果创造条件。越南人民将世世代代牢记住烈士们的功劳，不断地学习烈士们的勇敢精神，以克服一切艰苦困难，完成烈士们遗留给我们的革命事业。
    胡志明主席指出，党当前的任务是领导人民促进增产节约竞赛运动，在越南北方建设社会主义，使越南北方成为实现祖国的统一的斗争的稳固基础。他说，向党献礼的竞赛运动的良好结果证明了越南人民具有非常丰富和伟大的创造性和力量。胡主席说，1945年8月起义时，党只有近五千名党员。当时党能够领导全国人民胜利地进行八月革命。今天，党的队伍已增加到将近一百倍，即大约有五十万党员。此外，我们还有六十万多劳动青年团员。我们人民政权得到巩固，人民军和知识分子得到了锻炼、考验，并且不断地在进步。他指出，我们的力量是强大的，并且是日益强大的。在劳动党的英明领导下，越南的社会主义建设事业一定成功，争取国家的统一的斗争一定取得胜利，我们将为保卫亚洲和世界和平的事业作出应有的贡献。
    胡主席最后高呼：“伟大的越南劳动党万岁！”“越南和平、统一、独立、民主和富强万岁！”“以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义大家庭万岁！”“共产主义万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”
    胡志明主席接着在大会上吟诵了一首歌颂越南劳动党的诗。
    在各民族、妇女、儿童代表向以胡主席为首的党中央负责同志献花之后，越南劳动党中央政治局委员长征同志向大会作了长篇报告。
    长征同志概述了越南劳动党成立三十年来的光荣斗争历史、越南人民在党的领导下所取得的辉煌成就以及越南劳动和越南人民当前的任务。长征说，“在越南劳动党的正确领导下，越南人民已经从胜利走向胜利，而且还要获得更大的胜利。”
    黄国越同志接着宣读了各国兄弟党给越南劳动党的贺电。
    随后，越南祖国战线代表、七十一岁的裴?老先生和越南民主党代表严春庵、社会党代表阮阐先后发表讲话，向劳动党表示热烈的祝贺。祖国战线、民主党和社会党的代表把赠给越南劳动党的锦旗交给了胡志明主席。
    祖国战线赠送的锦旗上写道：“全国人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的周围团结起来”。民主党的锦旗上写道：“一心跟着党”；社会党的锦旗写道：“衷心感谢工人阶级和领导党”。
