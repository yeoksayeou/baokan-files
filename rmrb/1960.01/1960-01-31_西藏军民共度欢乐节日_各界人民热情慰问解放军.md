Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 30th. The Tibetan People's Spring Festival慰问团(Comfort Group) in the past two days, 28th and 29th, went in groups to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrisons near Lhasa, hospitals, and construction sites where the PLA is participating in construction to express their regards. Residents of various districts in Lhasa also went to nearby PLA garrisons to have get-togethers with the troops and celebrate the joyful festival together.

The deputy head of the overall Comfort Group, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and others, visited a certain PLA unit in the suburbs of Lhasa and the sick and wounded soldiers recuperating in the hospital on the 28th; on the 29th, they visited the "August First" Farm of the Tibet Military Region.

A慰问团(Comfort Group) sub-group, composed of团员(members) Langdun Gongga Wangqiu, Jiazholin Living Buddha, and others, visited the Nagchin Hydropower Station construction site in Lhasa on the 28th to express their regards to the PLA officers and soldiers who are building the power station there. This power station is currently a relatively large construction project in Tibet. Thanks to the active construction of the PLA officers and soldiers and more than 4,000 Tibetan workers, more than 2 million cubic meters of earth and stone have been completed before the Spring Festival, and it is now nearing completion.

In the military club of the Tibet Military Region, the Spring Festival was full of joy. On the 28th, more than 500 representatives of residents from various districts in Lhasa came here to express their regards and have a get-together with the PLA officers and soldiers. Dengzeng, the director of a residents' committee in the Xidong district of Lhasa, on behalf of more than 30,000 residents of the city, sincerely thanked the invincible People's Liberation Army for opening up a new life path for the Tibetan people. Dengzeng read a poem by the Tibetan people praising the People's Liberation Army: "We used to live in hell, but today we live in paradise. This paradise on earth is the crystallization of the PLA's bloodshed. Ah, soldiers of Chairman Mao, you are the most beloved people." At this慰问 (comfort) get-together, amateur performance teams from various residents' committees in Lhasa and children from Lhasa No. 3 Primary School, established after the pacification of the rebellion, performed folk dances, herdsmen dances, and auspicious yak dances for the officers and soldiers. People warmly invited their own soldiers and civilians to sing and dance to their hearts' content.

During the three days of Lunar New Year's Eve, the first day and the second day of the Lunar New Year, many Tibetan and Hui citizens in Lhasa invited PLA officers and soldiers to spend the festival at their homes or residents' committees, and the troops also invited the masses to have get-togethers at their garrisons or offices. Day and night, get-together parties and forums that fully demonstrated the unity of the army and the people were held in the city and suburbs.

    据新华社拉萨30日电　西藏各界人民春节慰问团在28、29两天分组到拉萨附近部队驻地、医院和有解放军参加建设的工地进行慰问。拉萨各区居民也到附近的部队驻地同部队联欢，共度欢乐的节日。
