Promoting the Economic Hybridization of Pigs
Professor Zhang Zhongge, Beijing Agricultural University

What is economic hybridization? It is the mating of different breeds of pigs for the purpose of increasing economic returns. For example, the piglets produced by mating the Shaziling sow of Hunan Province and the Yorkshire boar are not only numerous and physically strong, but also grow quickly, mature early, have excellent meat quality, high slaughter rate, and economical feed utilization, all of which are superior to their original purebred parents.

According to the following table, when raised to ten months old, hybrid pigs can gain 19.6 to 20 kilograms more weight than purebred pigs; and for every kilogram of weight gained, they can use 0.2 to 0.4 kilograms less concentrate feed and 0.1 to 0.5 kilograms less green feed than raising purebred pigs; the slaughter rate is also increased by 8.5%. If we look at the country as a whole, it would be quite considerable if each pig could gain 20 kilograms more. Therefore, economic hybridization is a faster, better, and more economical way to increase pork production, and it should be vigorously promoted.

Reasons for the Significant Effectiveness of Economic Hybridization

The good results of economic hybridization are due to the fact that the differences between the gametes of different breeds of parents are much greater than the differences between the gametes of the same breed. Gametes (boar sperm and sow eggs) with a certain degree of physiological difference, when combined into one cell, one nucleus, produce a unified living body (zygote), and the biological contradiction of the zygote developing into a multicellular organism. This internal contradiction is the source of biological movement, development, and vitality, thus ensuring the acquisition of offspring with stronger vitality and increasing the intensity of metabolism.

In addition to improving the vitality of piglets, enriching and expanding the genetic basis of hybrid piglets also plays a significant role. The piglets produced after hybridization can combine the characteristics of different breeds of parents and obtain the basis for dual development. This dual heredity is a prerequisite for making hybrid piglets have strong vitality and strong adaptability to changing living conditions. It can be seen that the characteristics of the first-generation hybrid are strong vitality, early maturity, rapid growth and development, high production performance, and so on. This phenomenon of exceeding the parents in development and other aspects is called "hybrid vigor".

Can any hybrid combination work? Generally, when two different breeds of pigs are hybridized, they mostly exhibit "hybrid vigor." However, due to the different hybrid combinations, the degree of superiority is different, and sometimes even adverse effects occur due to poor combinations.

As can be seen from the following table, among the various hybrid combinations of Rongchang pigs, the Rongchang ♀ x Yorkshire ♂ hybrid has the best effect. When the weight reaches 91 kilograms, the feeding days can be shortened by 63 days compared with purebred Rongchang pigs. The hybrid pigs gain weight rapidly, have a high slaughter rate, and consume 0.49 kilograms less concentrate feed per kilogram of weight gained than purebred Rongchang pigs. This is unmatched by any other hybrid combination.

(Attached Table)

As can be seen from the following table, some hybrid combinations have the opposite effect. For example, the Pingxiang ♀ x Yushan ♂ hybrid grows worse than the purebred Pingxiang pigs. Pingxiang pigs can reach a weight of 74.4 kilograms at ten months, while this "Ping-Yu" hybrid is only 56.7 kilograms, a decrease of 17.7 kilograms; at twelve months, the difference is 32.3 kilograms, resulting in a serious reduction in production. As for the Yushan ♀ x Nanchang ♂ hybrid, although it shows a slight hybrid effect compared with purebred Yushan pigs, it is not obvious. Among them, the hybrid obtained by Pingxiang ♀ x Yorkshire ♂ has the greatest effect. Compared with purebred Pingxiang pigs, under the same feeding management conditions, each pig can gain an additional 8.5 kilograms per year than Pingxiang pigs. In terms of feed efficiency, each kilogram of weight gain can reduce 1.1 feed units, and the slaughter rate can be increased by 0.9%.

(Attached Table)

What is worth mentioning here is that when selecting hybrid combination objects, it is necessary to pay attention to the differences (heterogeneity) of the mutually matching breeds and the production performance of the breeds to be used as the paternal line. For example, the above-mentioned Nanchang, Yushan, and Pingxiang pig breeds are all local varieties produced in Jiangxi. Being in the same natural geographical conditions of Jiangxi Province, their origins can be traced back to a common origin, so the hybridization between them is the combination of relatively similar gametes. Because the difference in sexual factors is small and the internal contradiction is small, the hybrid advantage cannot be displayed. In addition, when selecting the paternal breed for hybridization, it is necessary to pay attention to the excellent characteristics of the paternal breed, and the production performance should be higher than that of the maternal breed or have other special advantages. If the selection is improper, it will cause the phenomenon of reducing the performance of the original breed. As mentioned above, Yushan pigs have relatively poor production performance among several local pig breeds in Jiangxi. Therefore, when it is hybridized with Pingxiang pigs, which have relatively high production performance, it causes a serious phenomenon of reduced weight of the hybrid. It must be stated that the fact that the hybrid effects of the above-mentioned "Yushan ♀ x Nanchang ♂" and "Pingxiang ♀ x Yushan ♂" are not significant should not lead to the conclusion that the hybridization work between Chinese local varieties is ineffective. The effectiveness of hybridization mainly lies in carefully selecting the hybridization objects, and selecting those breeds with high production performance and large differences in origin, physiological characteristics, and external environmental conditions.

A large fat pig raised by the Bayi People's Commune in Liangshan County, Shandong Province, was hybridized with a local Liangshan sow (belonging to the North China pig type) and a Jinhua boar (belonging to the Central China pig type), and weighed 340 kilograms. This powerfully illustrates that as long as we select and match properly, the effect of hybridization between Chinese local varieties is no less than that of hybridization with foreign breeds.

Experiences and Lessons

Economic hybridization of pigs was also carried out to some extent before liberation; especially after liberation, scientific research institutions and the masses carried out large-scale economic hybridization of pigs and achieved great results. In December 1957, the Central Ministry of Agriculture convened a national symposium on pig feed and economic hybridization, emphasizing that in the future, in order to increase the weight and meat yield of offspring pigs, it is necessary to widely and systematically carry out economic hybridization of pigs. The meeting believed that there are not many foreign improved breeds at present, and the breeding boars used for economic hybridization do not necessarily have to be foreign breeds. Both domestic and foreign improved breeds can be used as breeding pigs for economic hybridization. In particular, domestic improved breeds have strong adaptability and low requirements for feed. The first-generation hybrids produced are more adaptable to the current feed and feeding management conditions in rural areas of our country; at the same time, domestic improved breeds are widely distributed, large in number, and breeding pigs are easier to obtain and cheaper in price, so we should actively advocate using more domestic improved breed pigs. According to the experiments of some units, the more favorable economic hybrid combination forms can be summarized as follows:

North China pigs (including pigs in Inner Mongolia, Northeast, Northwest and other places) should be economically hybridized with Berkshire, Soviet Large White pigs or excellent pig breeds in South China.

Central China pigs (including pigs in Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other places) should be economically hybridized with Yorkshire pigs or excellent pig breeds in South China.

South China pigs (including pigs in Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan and other places) should be economically hybridized with Yorkshire, Soviet Large White pigs or excellent pig breeds in North China.

In the past, some areas, when carrying out economic hybridization, lacked planning, resulting in progressive hybridization. The consequence was the complete elimination of local pig breeds. At the same time, because the feed and feeding management conditions could not keep up, the offspring showed degeneration. These experiences and lessons should be remembered. In the future, all localities must carry out economic hybridization in a planned manner, and should appropriately maintain a part of excellent local pigs so as to be able to supply a sufficient number of "raw materials" for economic hybridization.

    推广猪的经济杂交
    北京农业大学教授　张仲葛
    什么叫做经济杂交？就是为了增加经济上的收益而进行的不同品种的猪的交配。例如我国湖南的沙子岭母猪和约克夏公猪交配后所产的仔猪，数量既多，体质也强健，长的快，成熟早，肉质优良，屠宰率高，利用饲料经济，凡此种种，都不是它原来的纯种父母所能赶得上的。
    由下表看来，同样养到十个月大，杂种猪可以比纯种猪多长十九点六至二十公斤的体重；而且每长一公斤体重，可以比养纯种猪少用零点二至零点四公斤的精料和零点一至零点五公斤的青料；屠宰率也提高了8．5％。如果就全国范围来看，每头猪能多长二十公斤，那就颇为可观了。所以经济杂交是增产猪肉的一个多快好省的办法，应该大力推行。
    （附图表）
    经济杂交成效显著的原因
    经济杂交会产生良好的效果，是由于不同品种的双亲，它们之间的两性细胞，在其来源方面的差异，要比同一品种的两性细胞间的差异大得多。在生理上具有某种差异程度的两性细胞（公猪的精子和母猪的卵子），当它们结合成为一个细胞，一个核的时候，就产生了统一的活体（合子细胞），和由合子细胞发育成多细胞有机体的生物学上的矛盾。这种内部的矛盾性是生物的运动、发展和生活力的来源，因而保证了获得生活力更强的后代，提高了新陈代谢的强度。
    除了提高仔猪生活力以外，丰富和扩大杂种仔猪的遗传基础也起很大的作用。杂交后所产生的仔猪可以结合起不同品种亲代的特征，获得双重发展的基础，这种双重遗传性是使杂种仔猪具有强大的生活力，以及产生对变化的生活条件具有强大适应性的先决条件。由此可见，一代杂种的特点在于生活力强，早熟，生长发育快，生产性能高等等。这种在发育上以及其他各方面超过双亲的现象，称为“杂种优势”。任何杂交组合都行吗？一般两个不同品种的猪杂交时，大都表现出“杂种优势”。但是由于杂交组合的不同，优势表现的程度是不一样的，甚至于有时由于组合不好而呈现出不良的效果。
    由下表可以看出，在荣昌猪的各种杂交组合中，以荣昌??约克夏?杂种效果最好，体重达九十一公斤时，饲养日数可以较纯种荣昌猪缩短六十三天；杂种猪增重迅速，屠宰率高，每长一公斤体重又比荣昌纯种猪少花费零点四九公斤的精料。这是其他任何杂交组合所不及的。
　　（附图表）
    从下表可以看出，有的杂交组合是起了相反的效果。如萍乡??玉山?杂种，反较萍乡纯种繁殖的猪生长得差。萍乡猪当十个月时体重可达七十四点四公斤，而这“萍—玉”杂交种仅为五十六点七公斤，减少十七点七公斤；当十二个月时则相差三十二点三公斤，造成严重的减产现象。至于玉山??南昌?杂种，与玉山纯种繁殖的猪相较，虽略显杂交效果，但不明显。就中以萍乡??约克夏?获得的杂交种效果最大，与萍乡纯种猪相较，在相同的饲养管理条件下，每头每年较萍乡猪可多增重八公斤半，饲料报酬方面每公斤增重可降低一点一个饲料单位，屠宰率可提高0．9％。
　　（附图表）
    在这里值得提出的是，在选择杂交组合对象时，必须注意到相互配合的品种的差异性（异质性），以及所拟采用作为父系品种的生产性能。例如上述南昌、玉山、萍乡等猪种皆属产于江西的地方品种，同是处于江西省的自然地理条件下，其来源可以追溯到共同的起源，因而它们之间的杂交是比较相似的有性细胞的结合。由于有性因素的差异小，内部的矛盾小，因而就不能显示出杂交的优势来。此外在选择杂交的父系品种时，必须注意父系品种的优良特性，在生产性能方面要高于母系品种或有其他方面的特殊优点，如果选择不当，就会造成降低原有品种性能的现象。如上述玉山猪在江西的几个地方猪种中是生产性能较差的，因此当它和生产性能比较高的萍乡猪杂交时，因而造成了杂交种体重降低的严重现象。必须说明的是，不能由于上述的“玉山??南昌?”和“萍乡??玉山?”的杂交效果不显著，因此认为中国地方品种间的杂交工作都是无效果的。杂交效果如何，主要在于慎选杂交的对象，要选择那些生产性能高的，彼此在来源上生理特性上以及外界环境条件上差异较大的品种。
    山东梁山县八一人民公社养的一头大肥猪，是用梁山本地母猪（属华北猪的类型）和金华公猪（属华中猪的类型）杂交而成的，体重达三百四十公斤。这有力说明了只要我们选配得宜，中国地方品种之间的杂交，其效果并不亚于和外国种杂交。
    经验和教训
    猪的经济杂交，解放前也曾进行过一些研究工作；特别是解放后，科学研究机关和群众进行了大规模猪的经济杂交工作，获得了很大的成绩。1957年12月，中央农业部召开了全国猪饲料和经济杂交座谈会，着重的指出了今后为了提高后代猪的体重和出肉率，必须广泛的、有计划的进行猪的经济杂交工作。会议认为，目前外国良种不多，经济杂交所用的种公猪不必一定引用外国种，国内外良种都可以作为经济杂交的种猪。特别是国产良种的适应性强，对饲料的要求不高，所产一代杂种更能适应我国农村目前的饲料和饲养管理条件；同时国产良种分布广，数量多，种猪较易解决，价格也比较低，所以应该积极提倡多用本国良种猪。根据一些单位的试验，比较有利的经济杂交组合形式，可以归纳如下：
    华北猪（包括内蒙古、东北、西北等地的猪）以用巴克夏、苏联大白猪或我国华南的优良猪种进行经济杂交为宜。
    华中猪（包括安徽、江西、浙江等地的猪）以用约克夏猪或华南的优良猪种进行经济杂交为宜。
    华南猪（包括两广及四川等地的猪）以用约克夏、苏联大白猪或华北的优良猪种进行经济杂交为宜。
    过去有个别地区在进行经济杂交时，由于计划性不够，结果变成了级进杂交，其后果是土种猪的全盘消灭，同时因为饲料和饲养管理条件跟不上，以致后代反而出现退化现象。这些经验教训应该记取。各地对于经济杂交，今后必须有计划的进行，并应适当的保持一部分优良本地猪，以便能供应足够数量经济杂交的“原始材料”。
