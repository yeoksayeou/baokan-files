Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th. Situ Zan, Chairman of the Jakarta Chinese General Association in Indonesia, arrived in Hong Kong on the 18th to return to Guangzhou after being forced to leave Indonesia by the Indonesian authorities. He issued a written statement to Hong Kong journalists, the full text of which is as follows:

　　"In late April 1959, I returned to China to visit relatives and sightsee. In early August, I was honored to be invited to participate in the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland. At that time, I felt infinite glory and excitement, so I returned to Beijing in mid-August. In the capital, in addition to participating in various programs for the National Day, I also participated in the opening and closing ceremonies of the first National Games.

　　"On October 7, the Indonesian Foreign Minister was invited to visit our country and hold talks. I was also invited to participate in the welcome and banquet for Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio. I was particularly pleased with the 'Joint Communiqué' jointly signed and issued by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio on October 11. When a reporter from the Antara News Agency in Indonesia visited Beijing on October 15, I first expressed my warm support for this 'Joint Communiqué,' which has great significance for friendly relations between China and Indonesia. At the same time, I expressed my opposition to the Indonesian former Minister of Commerce's regulations prohibiting 'foreign small merchants' below the county level. Because this measure has in fact been used to stir up a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment, causing hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in rural areas to lose their livelihoods and live in extreme hardship. This is neither in line with the spirit of Sino-Indonesian friendship nor does it conform to humanitarianism and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Asian-African Conference.

　　"It was truly unexpected that I would be detained and ordered to leave the country by the holder of wartime central military power in Indonesia simply because I returned to China to participate in the National Day celebrations and gave a statement to a reporter from the Antara News Agency in Indonesia. It's truly 'patriotic to be guilty,' and even talking about friendship is not allowed!

　　"I have resided in Indonesia for more than thirty years, always serving overseas Chinese education and doing my best for charitable relief efforts in Indonesian society and for the friendly work between the peoples of China and Indonesia. This is obvious to overseas Chinese in various places and many Indonesian friends. Therefore, I believe that this measure of being innocently detained for a month and forced to leave the country is not only contrary to international law but also violates Indonesia's current laws. This unreasonable persecution I have suffered from the Indonesian authorities is also one of the anti-Chinese and anti-China incidents manufactured by reactionary elements in Indonesia colluding with imperialists. In order to show that I was persecuted innocently and to safeguard human rights, I formally protested to the Indonesian government in writing before leaving Indonesia.

　　"Personally, I was originally eager to return to the warm embrace of the motherland and contribute to the great work of building a socialist society together with the whole country in jubilation. However, seeing that there are still hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese living in rural areas of Indonesia being subjected to extremely barbaric forced relocation, and seeing that the overseas Chinese are being concentrated and living an extremely miserable concentration camp life, it is truly sympathetic and indignant. For the sake of Sino-Indonesian relations, the long-term friendship between the two peoples, and the harmonious coexistence of Asian and African countries, I sincerely hope that the Indonesian authorities will immediately stop the anti-Chinese measures in Indonesia and accept Foreign Minister Chen Yi's proposal for comprehensive negotiations to resolve the overseas Chinese issue existing between the two countries. This is the only correct and reasonable way to comprehensively resolve the overseas Chinese issue."

### 印度尼西亚雅加达中华侨团总会主席  司徒赞被迫离境返国  路过香港时发表书面谈话谴斥排华行为

    印度尼西亚雅加达中华侨团总会主席
    司徒赞被迫离境返国
    路过香港时发表书面谈话谴斥排华行为
    新华社香港18日电　印度尼西亚雅加达中华侨团总会主席司徒赞在被印度尼西亚当局迫令离境后，18日到达香港转道回广州。他向香港的新闻记者发表了书面谈话，全文如下：
      “本人于1959年4月下旬回国省亲观光，8月初很荣幸地应邀参加伟大的祖国建国十周年国庆盛典。当时感到无限光荣和兴奋，所以即于8月中旬返回北京。在首都时除参加国庆节的各项节目外，还参加了首届全国运动会的开幕和闭幕典礼。
    “10月7日印度尼西亚外长应邀到我国访问，并进行会谈，本人亦应邀参加对印度尼西亚外长苏班德里约的欢迎和欢宴。对10月11日陈毅副总理兼外长和印度尼西亚苏班德里约外长共同签署发表的‘联合公报’尤感欢欣。当10月15日印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社驻北京记者来访问时，我首先表示热烈拥护这个对中印（尼）两国友好关系具有重大意义的‘联合公报’，同时表示反对印度尼西亚前商长禁止县以下‘外侨小商’的条例。因为这种措施事实上已被利用来掀起一股排华的浪潮，使数十万乡村地区的华侨丧失生计，生活陷于极度困难。这既不符合中印（尼）友好精神，也违背人道主义和万隆亚非会议的十项原则。
      “事情真是出乎意料之外，我就为了回国参加国庆观礼和接见印度尼西亚安塔拉通讯社驻北京记者发表谈话，就成为印度尼西亚战时中央军权执掌者的拘禁我和令我离境的唯一借口和理由。真是‘爱国有罪’，谈友好也不被容许了！
      “我居留印度尼西亚三十多年，始终为华侨教育服务，也为印度尼西亚社会的慈善救济事业和中印（尼）两国人民的友好工作尽其绵力。这是各地侨胞和许多印度尼西亚朋友有目共睹的。因此，对这次无辜被拘禁一个月并迫令离境的措施，我认为这不但不合乎国际公法，同时也违反印度尼西亚的现行法律。我这次遭受印度尼西亚当局无理的迫害，也是印度尼西亚反动分子勾结帝国主义者所制造的排华反华事件之一。为了表明我无罪而受到迫害，和维护人权起见，我在离开印度尼西亚前，曾用书面正式向印度尼西亚政府表示抗议。
    “在我个人而言，能回到温暖的祖国怀抱来，在举国欢腾共同努力建设社会主义社会的伟大工作中尽一分力量，原是求之不得的。但看到居住在印度尼西亚乡村地区还有成千上万的侨胞，受到极其蛮横的武力迫迁，和看到侨胞们被集中起来过着极其悲惨的集中营生活，实是令人同情和愤慨。为了中印（尼）两国邦交，两民族的长远友谊和亚非国家的和睦共处，我切盼印度尼西亚当局立即停止印度尼西亚的反华排华措施，并接受陈毅外长关于全面解决存在于两国之间的华侨问题的建议进行谈判。这是全面解决华侨问题合情合理和唯一的正确途径。”
