Xinhua News Agency, 19th January: Starting from the 18th, vast areas of eastern China have once again experienced rain and snow. In some parts of Hebei, the rain and snow have been intermittent since the 15th and have not stopped. The North China Plain and most areas of the Huai River Basin have again had snow, while the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and northern parts of Guangdong and Guangxi have had rain. This rain and snow is expected to continue for another day or two. The area covered by snowfall in the north this time is not as large as that of the 15th and 16th, with Shanxi and Shaanxi experiencing basically no snowfall. The snowfall in the North China Plain is generally only one to five millimeters, which is also less than the last time. Shanxi and Shaanxi still feel the effects of the winter drought. The rainfall in the south has been relatively heavy this time, with moderate rain in Hunan and Jiangxi on the 19th, and heavy rain in some areas.
