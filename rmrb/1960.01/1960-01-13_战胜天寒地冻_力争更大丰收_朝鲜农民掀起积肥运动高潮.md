Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th January: Korean farmers, in order to strive for even greater harvests this year, have launched a red-hot manure accumulation campaign.

Currently, northern Korea is in the midst of severe winter, but farmers in various regions, disregarding the bitter cold, are enthusiastically accumulating compost, digging peat, and dredging river mud.

North Hamgyong Province has extracted 60% of its labor force to invest in the manure accumulation campaign.

Up to now, this agricultural cooperative has accumulated 1.15 million tons of compost and is striving to accumulate 4.28 million tons of fertilizer.

The farmers of Mundok County, on the Twelve Three Thousand Ri Plain, who achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1959, plan to apply 50 tons of compost to each chongbo (equivalent to 15 Chinese mu) of paddy field this year and are striving to complete this task within January.

The members of the Yongrim-ri Agricultural Cooperative in this county, in order to strive for a further 70% increase in production this year, are going 30 li (approx. 10 miles) away to dig peat for fertilizer. The 300 young people of this cooperative formed a youth shock brigade and laid a light railway to further improve work efficiency. Other members also formed many teams to haul manure and urine from the nearby Anju coal mine, and to dredge river mud from ditches and bomb craters.

In order to support agricultural production, the staff and workers of agricultural machinery stations in various regions have also invested in the manure accumulation campaign, driving tractors to help agricultural cooperatives haul fertilizer to the fields.

    战胜天寒地冻  力争更大丰收
    朝鲜农民掀起积肥运动高潮
    新华社平壤11日电  朝鲜农民为了争取今年的更大丰收，已经掀起了热火朝天的积肥运动。
    目前朝鲜北部正值严冬，各地农民不顾天寒地冻，干劲冲天地积堆肥、挖泥炭和掏河泥。
    咸镜北道各地农业社抽出了60％的劳动力投入积肥运动。
    到目前为止，这个农业社已经积了一百一十五万吨堆肥，并且正在为争取积四百二十八万吨肥料而奋战。
    在1959年取得了空前大丰收的十二三千里平原上的文德郡农民，今年要在每町步（合十五市亩）水田里施五十吨堆肥，并且努力争取在1月份以内完成这个任务。
    这个郡的龙林里农业社的社员们为了争取今年再增产七成，到三十里以外的地方去挖泥炭来作肥料。这个社的三百名青年组成了青年突击队，铺设了一条轻便铁道，进一步提高了工作效率。其他的社员也分别组成许多队到附近安州煤矿去拉粪和尿，到河沟和炸弹坑里去掏河泥。
    为了支援农业生产，各地的农业机械作业所的职工们也投入了积肥运动，他们开着拖拉机帮助农业社往田里拉肥料。
