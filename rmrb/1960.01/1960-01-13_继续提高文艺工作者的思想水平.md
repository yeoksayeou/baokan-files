    Continue to Improve the Ideological Level of Literary and Art Workers
    Tao Bai, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Jiangsu's cultural and artistic work, under the leadership of the Party and under the glorious illumination of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, has made great achievements and undergone fundamental changes in general, just like all parts of the country, presenting a new look. We should fully affirm our achievements, enhance our confidence, and continue to move forward. We believe that fully and correctly affirming achievements is a matter of affirming the victory of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, safeguarding the development of socialist literature and art, proving the greatness and correctness of the Party's leadership, and enhancing the proletariat's ambition while diminishing the bourgeoisie's prestige.

    In order to enable literary and art work to achieve greater success on the road forward, literary and art workers must be required to continue to improve their thinking, that is, to continue to carry out ideological revolution. This is a driving force that enables the literary and art circles to unite better, carry out self-transformation, and constantly play a role in promoting the prosperity of socialist literature and art.

    Theoretically speaking, Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought advocate the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. In order to make the thinking of literary and art workers not only adapt to, but also promote the continuous revolution on the economic and political fronts, ideological revolution must be constantly carried out on the ideological front.

    Currently, class has not been completely eliminated in the country, and the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie is still very deep; abroad, imperialism and capitalism still exist, and the revisionist trend of thought is also spreading its influence. Therefore, if someone believes that bourgeois ideology can be changed into socialist ideology without struggle, this is an opportunist idea. This is a reflection of the thought of not wanting and not daring to carry out ideological revolution.

    Literary and art work itself is ideological work. Literary and art workers are "engineers of the human soul," therefore, literary and art workers themselves are first required to have a socialist and communist soul. Without such a soul, it is impossible to create works with a socialist and communist soul, and they cannot be called engineers of the soul. To have such a noble soul, ideological revolution must be constantly carried out. In today's class society, people's thoughts are either proletarian or bourgeois, and proletarian thought develops and consolidates in the struggle against bourgeois thought.

    Practice fully proves that the ideological revolution of literary and art workers is an important guarantee for the prosperity of socialist literature and art. In the near term, it has been the ten years since liberation, and in the longer term, since the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," a series of ideological struggles have been carried out in the literary and art circles. Every time an ideological struggle is carried out, the proletarian literary and art cause takes a step forward. The results of each ideological struggle prove the correctness of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art. Each struggle has educated and raised the ideological consciousness of a group of literary and art workers. The more thorough their ideological revolution, the greater their revolutionary zeal. They are full of vigor and forge ahead bravely, and can withstand tests in great storms. Of course, some negative teachers also appear in each struggle. However, the outcome is not that the literary and art team is getting smaller and smaller, but bigger and bigger, not that the combat effectiveness is weakened, but that the combat effectiveness is getting stronger and stronger. In particular, a large number of new forces are constantly growing up in the struggle. This is a law.

    From the actual situation of Jiangsu's literary and art circles, the origins and components of literary and art workers, except for a few who come from worker and peasant families, are mostly petty-bourgeois or bourgeois. The education and ideology of the bourgeoisie have a considerable influence on them. Some people have quite serious bourgeois individualism and liberalism. Therefore, they often isolate art, one-sidedly exaggerate its particularity, and even mystify it, as if it is a special cause done by special people. Generally speaking, such people have these burdens: class burden, ideological burden, or plus a literary and art ideological burden. The more in-depth the socialist revolution, the more inevitably it will conflict with their class interests, individualism and liberalism, and bourgeois literary and art thoughts.

    Among some people in Jiangsu's literary and art circles, literary and art ideas such as not caring about politics, not wanting the Party's leadership, not wanting literature and art to serve politics, valuing the ancient and belittling the present, blindly worshiping Western Europe, and ignoring the mass line and popularization work still exist to varying degrees. Some people have not yet solved the fundamental issue of the relationship between art and politics in their thinking.

    The ideological problems that occur among literary and art workers, especially literary and art ideological problems, are all determined by the fundamental issue of world outlook. With a bourgeois world outlook, bourgeois literary and art thoughts will inevitably be produced; while a proletarian world outlook will produce proletarian literary and art thoughts. Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art originates from a thorough proletarian Marxist world outlook. Starting from the proletarian world outlook, Comrade Mao Zedong brilliantly applied Marxism to solve the fundamental problems in literature and art, and brilliantly developed Marxist literary and art theory. We must strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought and use it as a weapon to continue to carry out ideological revolution and fundamentally revolutionize the bourgeois world outlook.

    The world outlook is concrete, not abstract. The following issues need to be further clarified:

    First, the issue of respecting the working people, or the issue of the relationship between literary and art workers and the working people.

    We are Marxist materialists. Therefore, we must respect materialism. The fundamental issue of respecting materialism is first of all to respect the people, respect the working people who create history, and respect all the creations of the masses. China's working people have always been diligent and brave, especially under the leadership of our Party, they have created unprecedented miracles. Our literary and art workers should take the will of the people as their will, the demands of the people as their demands, and the hobbies of the people as their hobbies, respect the people from the depths of their souls, serve the people, and reflect the heroic spirit and mental state of the people in creating history. This is also the issue of adhering to the policy of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers. This is a problem of the proletarian world outlook, not another problem. Some of our literary and art workers do not respect the people, do not respect the creations of the people, and even look down on the people at all. This is not another problem, but a manifestation of the bourgeois world outlook.

    Second, Marxists observe things using dialectics.

    The fundamental issue of dialectics is the scientific issue of studying the relationship between the essential, the mainstream, the overall situation and the phenomenal, the temporary, the partial, the scientific issue of studying the main contradiction and the secondary contradiction, that is, the issue of distinguishing the relationship between nine fingers and one finger. The essential, mainstream, and overall situation issues, even if they are still in their infancy, are new things with strong vitality, are the direction of social development, and are issues that express the spirit of the times. A writer, poet, singer, or painter with a proletarian world outlook should reflect and praise the direction of the advance of the times, should fight against various forces that promote retreat, and should have the analytical ability to plant red flags and identify the direction of the wind. However, some people are not interested in the essential, mainstream, and overall situation issues, are not interested in the nine-finger issues, but exaggerate trivial matters and the one-finger issues. This is also a world outlook issue. We believe that our literature and art must reflect the essential, mainstream, and overall things, in order to educate the people to fight for the great ideal, the communist ideal.

    Third, we must have continuous revolution.

    The concrete manifestation of continuous revolution is to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and to prosper the socialist cause of literature and art with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in accordance with the general line. We must master dialectical materialism, gradually understand the laws of development of objective things in practice, and give full play to the role of subjective initiative.

    The reason why the proletarian revolution is great is that it has the ambition to transform the world; the reason why proletarian literature and art are great is that they educate the proletariat to transform the world. Now is the era when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. We must stir up revolutionary enthusiasm, that is, give full play to our subjective initiative, and constantly carry out revolutionary struggles, so that we will surely be able to complete our tasks.

    Fourth, the issue of Party spirit.

    This is the most fundamental issue of whether one possesses a proletarian world outlook. Our Party is led by our Party Central Committee and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. Every one of our Party members must resolutely stand firm on the Party's stand in order to grasp Mao Zedong Thought, move in the correct direction, and make fewer or no mistakes in our work, thereby achieving success in various socialist undertakings, including our literary and art undertakings. Otherwise, there will be no good end. Historical facts have proved this.

    Secondly, I remember that Comrade Lu Dingyi said in his speech at the National Congress of Heroes not long ago: Whether or not to listen to the Party's leadership and whether or not to listen to Chairman Mao's words is our political dividing line with the bourgeoisie, and there is no room for ambiguity here. We must resolutely fight against any tendency to oppose the Party's leadership.

    However, some Party members are sloppy and careless about the Party and Marxism. They are indifferent to remarks attacking the Party, but they fly into a rage when someone criticizes them. This is an issue worthy of our attention.

    We believe that the strength of Party spirit is the highest manifestation of whether or not one has a proletarian world outlook.

    The following four aspects are interconnected: materialism or idealism, dialectics or metaphysics, the theory of continuous revolution or the theory of revolutionary stagnation, and the strength of Party spirit. This is the dividing line between the proletarian world outlook and the bourgeois world outlook.

    In order to enable literary and art workers in Jiangsu Province to truly establish a proletarian world outlook and continue to carry out ideological revolution in the literary and art circles, we have the following ideas:

    Launch a comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth movement to study Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is a complete and scientific ideological system of Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art is only a component of the entire Mao Zedong Thought. To grasp Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, we must study the entire Mao Zedong Thought.

    Launching a study movement of Mao Zedong Thought and mastering the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought is a major political task. The literary and art circles must first oppose revisionist literary and art thoughts, and at the same time, among some old cadres in the literary and art circles, they must also oppose empiricism, because empiricism is easy to become a captive of revisionist literary and art thoughts. In new Party members, we must strengthen the education of Mao Zedong Thought.

    We need to continue to organize literary and art workers to go to factories and the countryside, participate in labor training, and combine with the masses. Fundamentally speaking, this is the issue of the laborization of intellectuals. On the one hand, writers create for the masses, and on the other hand, they launch a mass creation movement. Combine literary and art workers' labor training among the masses with work, study, and creation. To this end, we must summarize existing experience and make specific arrangements. The methods can be flexible and diverse, but they must be resolutely and regularly implemented.

    We need to build a team in a planned way. Currently, the formation of teams in various literary and art departments in Jiangsu is uneven. For example, the drama team is relatively large, while the literature and music teams are very small. The various aspects of a department are also unbalanced. For example, in fine arts, Chinese painting has formed a team, but the oil painting, sculpture, and printmaking teams have not been well organized or have not been formed. Even in formed teams, development is unbalanced. There are more old intellectuals and old artists, while the newly trained young teams are relatively poor. Therefore, we must establish and expand teams in quantity and further improve the level of these teams in quality. For old literary and art workers, we must strengthen transformation work, for new ones, we must strengthen training work, and for those with wrong ideas, we must continue to strengthen help, education, and transformation. The general requirement is to achieve the goal of building a truly proletarian literary and art team.

    We also need to further carry out literary and art criticism and literary and art theory work. This has not been done well enough in Jiangsu Province. We must resolutely implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," run literary and art publications well, and regularly attach importance to literary and art criticism in publications. Strengthen the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial Institute of Literature and actively carry out theoretical research work. The methods of carrying out work should be diverse, but they must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought and face reality. There must be both long-term plans, and more emphasis on solving the current major or trending problems.

    Currently, there is a tendency in the literary and art circles of Jiangsu Province. Some literary and art workers study ancient and Western European works from their personal needs and interests with an incorrect attitude; they appreciate those works that they are interested in. Therefore, they are not interested in or understand the current literary and art situation, and cannot carry out literary and art criticism and literary and art theory work. This is a wrong attitude and should not be the case for the Party's literary and art work. If you don't understand the new things, especially if you dislike the lack of artistry and are unwilling to watch newly created modern dramas, you can't help water the flowers and make them grow; if you don't understand works with bad tendencies, especially those that spread poison among the masses, you can't weed out the weeds, and you give up the struggle on the ideological front. Therefore, we must emphasize supporting new things, even if they are immature; at the same time, we must wage struggle against toxic things, and in this work, cultivate Jiangsu's theoretical team.

    We should also require editors to participate in literary and art criticism and literary and art theory work. Because they are in charge of the creation situation, they can improve their ability to distinguish works and their level of understanding.

    Finally, strengthening the Party's leadership over literary and art work is a fundamental issue. At present, Party organizations at all levels attach great importance to the leadership of literary and art work, and often intervene and participate in literary and art work. We require Party member cadres in literary and art units to resolutely implement the Party's policies, strengthen unity, and form the Party's leadership core. We must oppose the idea of ​​making being an expert the first priority and being a Party member the second.

    Now is a great situation. Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, our confidence has become higher, our enthusiasm has become stronger, our understanding has become clearer, and our thinking has become more improved. We must make more achievements to welcome the great 40th anniversary of the Party.

    继续提高文艺工作者的思想水平
    中共江苏省委宣传部副部长  陶白
    江苏的文化艺术工作，在党的领导下，在毛泽东文艺思想的光辉照耀下，从总的方面来说，和全国各地一样，成绩很大，发生了根本性的变化，出现了新的面貌。我们应该充分肯定成绩，提高我们的信心，继续前进。我们认为充分地正确地肯定成绩，是肯定毛泽东文艺思想胜利的问题，是保卫社会主义文艺事业发展的问题，是证明党的领导伟大正确的问题，是长无产阶级志气、灭资产阶级威风的问题。
    为了使文艺工作在前进的道路上获得更大的成绩，必须要求文艺工作者继续提高思想，也就是继续进行思想革命。这是使文艺界更好地团结起来，进行自我改造，对繁荣社会主义文学艺术经常起作用的动力。
    从理论上说，马克思主义和毛泽东思想主张不断革命论和革命发展的阶段论，为了使文学艺术家的思想不仅适应，而且能够对经济战线、政治战线上的不断革命起促进作用，就必须不断地进行思想战线上的革命。
    现在在国内，阶级还没有最后消灭，资产阶级的思想影响还很深；在国外，帝国主义、资本主义还存在着，修正主义的思潮也在散播着影响。因此，如果有人认为，不经过斗争，资产阶级思想就可以改变为社会主义思想，这是机会主义的思想。这是不想和不敢进行思想革命的思想的反映。
    文艺工作本身就是思想工作。文艺工作者是“人类灵魂工程师”，因此，首先要求文艺工作者本身有社会主义、共产主义灵魂。没有这样的灵魂，决不可能创作有社会主义、共产主义灵魂的作品，也就不成其为灵魂的工程师。要具有这样崇高的灵魂，就必须不断地进行思想革命。在现在的阶级社会里，人们的思想，不是无产阶级思想，就是资产阶级思想，而无产阶级思想是在同资产阶级思想进行斗争中发展和巩固起来的。
    实践完全证明，文艺工作者的思想革命，是繁荣社会主义文艺事业的重要保证。从近的来说，是解放以来的十年，从较远的来说，自从毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以来，在文艺界曾经进行了一系列的思想斗争，每进行一次思想斗争，无产阶级的文艺事业就前进一步，每一次思想斗争的结果，都证明毛泽东文艺思想的正确。每一次斗争，都教育了、提高了一批文艺工作者的思想觉悟，他们的思想革命越彻底，革命劲头也越大。他们朝气蓬勃，勇往直前，在大风浪中，能够经得起考验。当然，每次斗争也都出现了一些反面教员。但是，结局不是文艺队伍愈来愈小，而是愈来愈大，不是削弱了战斗力，而是战斗力愈来愈强。特别是大批新生力量在战斗中不断地成长起来了。这是一条规律。
    从江苏文艺界的实际情况来看，文艺工作者的出身和成分，除个别出身于工农家庭外，绝大部分是小资产阶级或资产阶级。资产阶级的教育和思想，对他们的影响是相当深的。有的人具有相当严重的资产阶级个人主义和自由主义思想，因此他们常常把艺术孤立起来，片面地夸大它的特殊性，以至于把它神秘化起来，仿佛是特殊人物所干的特殊事业。一般说，这样的人就有这几个包袱：阶级包袱，思想包袱，或者再加上一个文艺思想包袱。社会主义革命越深入，就越是不可避免地要和他们的阶级利益、个人主义和自由主义、资产阶级的文艺思想发生冲突。
    在江苏文艺界的一部分人中间，不问政治、不要党的领导、不要文艺为政治服务，厚古薄今，盲目崇拜西欧，忽视群众路线，忽视普及工作等文艺思想，还或多或少地存在着。有些人还没有从思想深处解决艺术和政治的关系这样一个根本问题。
    文艺工作者中间所发生的思想问题，特别是文艺思想问题，都决定于世界观这一根本问题。有资产阶级世界观，必然产生资产阶级的文艺思想；而无产阶级世界观，就产生无产阶级的文艺思想。毛泽东文艺思想，正是根源于彻底的无产阶级的马克思主义世界观。毛泽东同志从无产阶级世界观出发，天才地运用马克思主义，解决了文艺上的根本问题，并辉煌地发展了马克思主义的文艺理论。我们要加强学习毛泽东思想，并以此为武器继续进行思想革命，从根本上革掉资产阶级世界观的命。
    世界观是具体的，不是抽象的。下面几个问题需要进一步地搞清楚：
    第一，尊重劳动人民的问题，或者说文艺工作者和劳动人民的关系问题。
    我们是马克思主义的唯物论者。因此，必须尊重唯物论。尊重唯物论的根本问题，首先要尊重人民，尊重创造历史的劳动人民，尊重人民群众的一切创造。我国的劳动人民历来是勤劳、勇敢的，特别是在我们党的领导下，创造了史无前例的奇迹。我们的文艺工作者，应该以人民的意志为意志，以人民的要求为要求，以人民的爱好为爱好，从灵魂深处尊重人民，为人民服务，反映人民创造历史的英雄气概和精神状态。这也就是必须坚持为工农兵服务的方针问题，这是无产阶级世界观的问题，不是别的问题。我们有些文艺工作者不尊重人民，不尊重人民的创造，甚至根本看不起人民，这也不是什么别的问题，而是资产阶级世界观的表现。
    第二，马克思主义者观察事物的方法是辩证法。
    辩证法的根本问题，是研究本质的、主流的、大局的和现象的、暂时的、局部的关系的科学问题，是研究主要矛盾与次要矛盾的科学问题，也就是区别九个指头与一个指头的关系的问题。本质的、主流的、大局的问题，那怕现在还是萌芽状态，然而是有强大生命力的新事物，是社会发展的方向问题，是表现时代的精神问题。一个具有无产阶级世界观的作家、诗人、歌手、画家，应该反映和歌颂时代前进的方向，应该同各种促退势力作斗争，应该有插红旗、辨风向的分析能力。可是有的人对本质、主流、大局的问题不感兴趣，对九个指头的问题不感兴趣，而夸大琐碎事物，夸大一个指头的问题。这也是一个世界观的问题。我们认为我们的文艺必须反映本质的、主流的、大局的东西，用以去教育人民为着伟大的理想、共产主义理想而奋斗。
    第三，要不断革命。
    不断革命的具体表现，就是要鼓足干劲，力争上游，就是要遵循总路线来多快好省地建设社会主义，多快好省地繁荣社会主义的文艺事业。我们要掌握辩证唯物论，在实践中逐步认识客观事物的发展规律，充分发挥主观能动性的作用。
    无产阶级革命之所以伟大，是在于有雄心壮志改造世界；无产阶级文艺之所以伟大，是在于教育无产阶级去改造世界。现在是东风压倒西风的时代，我们要把革命劲头鼓起来，也就是把主观能动性充分发挥起来，不断地进行革命斗争，这样就一定能够完成我们的任务。
    第四，党性问题。
    这是一个是否具备无产阶级世界观的最根本的问题。我们的党，是由我们的党中央和伟大的领袖毛泽东同志领导的党，我们每一个党员必须坚决站稳党的立场，才能掌握毛泽东思想，走向正确的方向，在工作中不犯错误或少犯错误，从而取得社会主义各项事业包括我们文艺事业的成就。否则就没有好下场，历史事实证明了这一点。
    其次一点，我记得不久以前陆定一同志在全国群英会上的讲话中说过：听不听党的领导，听不听毛主席的话，这是我们同资产阶级的政治分界线，这里一点也不许含糊。对于任何反对党的领导的倾向，我们必须与之坚决斗争。
    可是有的党员对党、对马克思主义马马虎虎，对于攻击党的言论，无动于衷，可是当有人批评了他，就暴跳如雷了。这是值得我们注意的问题。
    我们认为党性强不强，是有没有无产阶级世界观的最高表现。
    下面这四方面是互相联系的：唯物论还是唯心论，辩证法还是形而上学，不断革命论还是革命停顿论，党性强不强，这是区别无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的分界线。
    为了使江苏省文艺工作者真正树立起无产阶级世界观，继续进行文艺界的思想革命，我们有几点设想：
    开展一个全面地、系统地、深入地学习毛泽东思想的运动。毛泽东思想是一个完整的、科学的马克思列宁主义思想体系，毛泽东文艺思想只是整个毛泽东思想的一个组成部分。我们要掌握毛泽东文艺思想，必须学习整个毛泽东思想。
    展开毛泽东思想的学习运动，掌握毛泽东思想的武器，是个重大的政治任务。文艺界首先要反对修正主义文艺思想，同时在文艺界某些老干部中，还要反对经验主义，因为经验主义容易成为修正主义文艺思想的俘虏。在新党员中，要加强毛泽东思想的教育。
    我们需要继续组织文艺工作者下厂下乡，参加劳动锻炼，与群众结合起来。从根本上来说，这是知识分子劳动化的问题。一方面作家为群众创作，一方面开展群众创作运动。把文艺工作者到群众中去劳动锻炼，和工作、学习、创作很好地结合起来。为此我们要总结已有的经验，并作出具体的安排。方式可以灵活多样，但要坚定不移地经常化地执行。
    我们需要有计划地建立一支队伍。现在江苏的文艺各部门，队伍的形成是不平衡的。例如，戏剧队伍较大，文学、音乐队伍就很小。在一个部门的各方面也是不平衡的，例如美术方面，国画算是形成了一支队伍，但油画、雕塑、版画的队伍，还没有很好地组织，或是没有形成。即使在成形的队伍中，发展也是不平衡的，旧的知识分子、旧艺人出身的较多，新培养的青年队伍则较差。因此，我们要在数量上建立和扩大队伍，并在质量上进一步提高这些队伍的水平。对于老的文艺工作者，要加强改造工作，对于新的要加强培养工作，对于有错误思想的，要继续加强帮助教育改造。总的要求是达到建立一支真正的无产阶级的文艺队伍的目的。
    我们还需要进一步地开展文艺批评，开展文艺理论工作。这在江苏省是做得很不够的，我们要坚决贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，办好文艺刊物，经常地在刊物上重视文艺批评。加强对江苏省文学研究所的领导，积极进行理论研究工作。开展工作的方式方法要有多种多样，但必须以毛泽东思想为指导思想，面对实际。既要有长远的规划，更要着重解决当前的主要的或倾向性的问题。
    现在江苏省文艺界有一种倾向，有的文艺工作者，只从个人的需要和兴趣出发，以不正确的态度去学习古代的、西欧的作品；去欣赏那些自己感兴趣的作品。因而对当前的文艺情况不感兴趣，不了解，也就不能开展文艺批评和文艺理论工作。这对党的文艺理论工作来说，是种错误态度，是很不应该的。不了解新生的东西，特别是嫌艺术性差而不愿意看新创作的现代戏之类，就无法去帮助浇花使其成长；不了解有不良倾向的作品，特别是在群众中散布毒素的东西，也就无法去锄草，就放弃了思想战线上的斗争。因此，我们要强调支持新生事物，那怕是幼稚的、不成熟的；同时对有毒的东西展开斗争，并在这样的工作中，培养江苏省的理论队伍。
    我们还要要求编辑人员参加文艺批评和文艺理论工作。因为他们掌握创作的情况，同时可以提高他们的辨别作品的能力和认识水平。
    最后，加强党对文艺工作的领导，是一个根本性质的问题。现在各级党组织对文艺工作的领导是非常重视的，而且经常过问和参与文艺工作。我们要求在文艺单位的党员干部，坚决贯彻党的方针政策，加强团结，形成党的领导核心。要反对那种以当专家为第一，做党员为第二的思想。
    现在是个大好的形势，自党的八届八中全会以来，我们的信心更高了，干劲更足了，认识更清楚了，思想更提高了，我们一定要做出更多的成绩来，迎接伟大的党的四十周年。
