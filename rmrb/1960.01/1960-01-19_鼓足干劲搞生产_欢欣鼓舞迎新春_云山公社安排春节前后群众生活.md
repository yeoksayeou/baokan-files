Editor's Note: The Yunshan Commune Party Committee comprehensively arranges the lives of the masses on the "front lines" and "rear areas" during the Spring Festival, ensuring that production is balanced with rest and that commune members eat well and enjoy themselves, spending the Spring Festival happily, thriftily, and joyfully. Consequently, every commune member is satisfied, further boosting their enthusiasm for labor and powerfully promoting current production.

At present, winter production in rural areas is at its peak, and preparations for spring plowing are about to begin. In order to maintain the masses' high revolutionary enthusiasm and soaring drive, and to push the production movement from one climax to another, Party organizations at all communes should, like the Party Committee of Yunshan Commune, focus on people's livelihood, especially the livelihood of the masses during the Spring Festival, to further promote various aspects of production.

According to a report in the New Hunan Daily: While vigorously grasping production, the Yunshan Commune Party Committee in Ningxiang comprehensively and conscientiously made specific arrangements for the livelihood of the masses on the "front lines" and "rear areas" before and after the Spring Festival, ensuring that commune members eat well, live well, have a rhythmic production schedule, and a good balance of work and rest. As a result, every commune member is satisfied, and their enthusiasm for labor continues to rise, greatly promoting current production.

In the previous period, this commune had been working vigorously on water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, cultivation of winter crops, afforestation, and land reclamation, successfully completing or nearing completion of various production tasks. In terms of welfare, thanks to the superiority of the People's Commune and the leadership method of paying attention to both production and life in the previous period, collective welfare undertakings have been getting better and better, and the masses are very satisfied. Most of the 710 canteens in the commune have achieved "five goods": good planning for grain use; sufficient firewood and vegetables, raising pigs, chickens, ducks and fish well; innovation in cooking utensils, operating thriftily; cleanliness and hygiene, convenience for commune members; democratic management, sound systems, and friendly unity. Since the autumn harvest of 1959, more than 360,000 catties of grain have been saved. Currently, 13,800 mu of vegetables are growing lush and green, ensuring that each person can eat more than three catties of vegetables per day, and each person has an average reserve of 102 catties of various dried vegetables; more than 90% of the canteens have stored enough firewood for more than three months. Kindergartens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly are also run very well.

Recently, the Commune Party Committee analyzed the current situation and believed that the Spring Festival is approaching, and a large-scale spring plowing production campaign is about to begin. The Spring Festival is a grand traditional festival for the Chinese people, and it is necessary to further arrange production and life well. The Commune Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres from the commune, brigades, production teams, and canteen managers, repeatedly explaining the importance of doing a good job in production and life, affirming the great achievements of the previous period, commending the three red banner brigades of Tanshupu and others for their welfare, 67 red banner canteens, and 127 model individuals, and calling on everyone to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and compete with the advanced. On the basis of unifying ideological understanding, the cadre meeting made comprehensive arrangements. It was decided to use 5,000 laborers to complete the remaining water conservancy tasks, and arrange for 3,000 people to spend the New Year on the canal construction site; to increase the number of people and resources for fertilizer accumulation, with 5,000 people working hard for half a month, accumulating 840 dan of fertilizer per person before the Spring Festival; and to make comprehensive arrangements for other land reclamation, afforestation, cultivation of winter crops, and development of sideline production. It was also decided to quickly launch a mass movement to overfulfill production tasks to welcome the Spring Festival.

In terms of living arrangements, in accordance with the spirit of starting from production and running things thriftily, commune members should eat well, celebrate the Spring Festival in a lively, happy, thrifty and joyful way. (1) Enable commune members to have both strenuous labor and enjoyable rest, mobilize the masses to engage in tool reform, and implement skillful work to continuously improve work efficiency; (2) Ensure that commune members eat well; prepare a certain amount of non-staple foods, especially for migrant workers who spend the Spring Festival on the water conservancy construction site, they should eat better than those in the "rear area"; (3) Arrange for 1,700 people to vigorously increase cash income, and recover 450,000 yuan in cash before the Spring Festival to pay wages to commune members; (4) Combine fertilizer accumulation with two comprehensive cleanups to ensure a clean Spring Festival; (5) Organize all medical personnel to make rounds of medical treatment to ensure that there are basically no patients during the Spring Festival; (6) Solve the clothing and rain gear problems of a few households with many laborers but few resources; (7) Further store firewood, store enough firewood for half a year before the Spring Festival, and establish a heating room in each canteen; (8) Take three days off for the Spring Festival, organize 15 propaganda teams, mobilize all troupes, and carry out cultural and recreational activities in various forms to celebrate the great achievements of the continuous Great Leap Forward in the past two years. In addition, it is also necessary to do a good job in public security to prevent sabotage by the enemy.

After the meeting, all departments immediately took action. The entire commune organized more than 200 wood, bamboo, and iron workers to rush to repair and manufacture various transportation tools. In ten days, 2,100 earth carts, 360 flatbed carts, and 365 track ox carts have been added for migrant workers engaged in water conservancy construction, and 14 wooden track roads have been installed, which has doubled the work efficiency. Two rain gear processing plants have also been established to rush to make straw raincoats and bamboo hats. Fifteen temporary clinics have been established on the construction site, and doctors have been organized to bring health workers to make rounds of treatment. Each brigade has established a support team, mobilizing a total of more than 1,200 people to send 3,100 dan of firewood and more than 300,000 catties of various vegetables to the migrant workers on the construction site. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, all of the fertilizer transportation has also been mechanized. Motivate some canteens with insufficient firewood to organize manpower to rush to cut firewood, and heating rooms have been established in each canteen, kindergarten, and home for the elderly. 1,700 laborers have recovered 400,000 yuan, which can be used to pay wages immediately. At the same time, more than 4,600 yuan in cash was drawn from the public welfare funds of the commune and brigades to help families in difficulty solve the problems of cotton clothes and rain gear. The entire commune organized 2,200 students to collect 98,000 catties of chestnuts, Jingguang vines and other substitutes for steaming wine in their spare time, and processed 6,000 catties of white wine. The supply and marketing department and the grain department also organized forces to process more than 20,000 catties of non-staple foods for the Spring Festival. Major brigades also organized professional teams to fish.

In order to further strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses, the Commune Party Committee, led by the secretary, organized a condolence group of 40 people, including the heads of various departments and the general branch secretaries of major brigades, to visit construction sites and canteens to listen to the opinions of the masses. When Zhou Zhenghe, the first secretary of the Party Committee, visited the Qingfeng Canteen in Liushan Brigade, he found that the canteen had insufficient firewood reserves. That night, he discussed with the masses and decided to organize a surprise attack.

Through the specific arrangements for production and life before and after the Spring Festival, and the large-scale publicity to the commune members, the masses' enthusiasm for production has become greater and greater, greatly promoting the current production movement.

    鼓足干劲搞生产　欢欣鼓舞迎新春
    云山公社安排春节前后群众生活
    编者按：云山公社党委全面安排春节期间“前方”和“后方”群众的生活，在生产上做到有劳有逸，在生活上保证社员吃好、玩好，高高兴兴，勤俭愉快过春节。因而社员人人满意，进一步鼓舞了劳动热情，有力地推动了当前生产。
    现在农村冬季生产正处于高潮，而春耕准备工作又将开始。为了保持群众的高度革命热情和冲天干劲，使生产运动从一个高潮推向又一个新的高潮，各公社党组织就要像云山公社的党委那样，抓好生活，特别是抓好春节期间的群众生活，进一步推动各项生产。
    据新湖南报报道：宁乡云山公社党委在大抓生产的同时，全面地认真地作好了春节前后“前方”、“后方”群众生活的具体安排，保证社员吃得好，住得好，生产有节奏，劳逸安排好，因而社员人人满意，劳动情绪不断高涨，大大推动了当前生产。
    前一时期，这个公社在兴修水利、积肥、培育冬种作物、造林、开荒等方面，都搞得热火朝天，出色的完成或接近完成了各项生产任务。在生活福利方面，由于人民公社的优越性，和前一时期注意了一手抓生产、一手抓生活的领导方法，集体生活福利事业越办越好，群众都很满意。全公社的七百一十个食堂大都做到了“五好”：计划用粮好；柴菜充足，猪鸡鸭鱼养得好；炊具革新，勤俭办事好；清洁卫生，方便社员好；民主管理，制度健全，团结友爱好。从1959年秋收以来共节余粮食三十六万多斤。现有一万三千八百亩蔬菜长得满垅青葱，可以保证每人每天吃菜三斤以上，每人平均还贮备了各种干菜一百零二斤；90％以上的食堂都贮足了三个月以上的烧柴。幼儿园、托儿所、敬老院办得也很好。
    最近，公社党委分析了当前情况，认为春节临近，大规模的春耕生产运动即将开始，而春节又是我国人民盛大的传统节日，必须进一步安排好生产和生活。公社党委召开了公社、大队、生产队、食堂管理员等干部会议，反复说明搞好生产和搞好生活的重要意义，肯定了前一时期的巨大成绩，表扬了滩山铺等三个生活福利红旗大队、六十七个红旗食堂、一百二十七个模范人物，号召大家学先进、赶先进、赛先进。干部会议在统一思想认识的基础上，作出了全面安排。决定以五千个劳力突击完成水利扫尾任务，安排三千人在渠道工地上过年；积肥增兵增将，五千人大干半个月，春节前每人积肥八百四十担；其他开荒、造林、培育冬种作物、开展副业生产都作了全面安排。还决定迅速开展一个超额完成生产任务，迎接春节的群众运动。
    在生活安排上，根据从生产着手、勤俭办事的精神，使社员吃得好，热热闹闹、高高兴兴、勤俭愉快地过好春节。（1）使社员既有紧张的劳动，又有愉快的休息，发动群众大搞工具改革，实行巧干，以不断提高工效；（2）保证社员吃好；准备好一定数量的副食品，特别是对在水利工地过春节的民工，更要比“后方”吃得好些；（3）安排一千七百人大抓现金收入，春节前抓回现金四十五万元，给社员发一次工资；（4）结合积肥开展两次全面大扫除，做到干干净净过春节；（5）组织所有医务人员巡回医疗，做到过春节时基本无病人；（6）解决少数人多劳力少的困难户的衣服和雨具问题；（7）进一步储贮柴火，春节前贮足半年的柴火，每个食堂建立一个取暖室；（8）春节放假三天，组织十五个宣传队，动员所有剧团，采取各种各样的形式，开展文化娱乐活动，庆祝两年来的连续大跃进的伟大成就。此外，还要做好治安保卫工作，防止敌人破坏。
    会后，各个部门立即行动起来。全公社组织木、篾、铁工人二百多个，突击修制各种运输工具。十天时间已为兴修水利的民工加制了二千一百部土车，三百六十部板车，三百六十五部轨道牛车，装木轨路十四条，使工效成倍提高。还成立了两个雨具加工厂，赶制蓑衣、斗笠。在工地上成立了十五个临时诊所，组织医师带上保健员，巡回治病。每个大队成立了一个支援队，共动员一千二百多人为工地民工送柴三千一百多担，送各种蔬菜三十多万斤。在积肥方面也全部实现了运肥车子化。发动部分烧柴不足的食堂，组织人力突击砍柴，每个食堂、幼儿园和敬老院都建立了取暖室。一千七百个劳力已抓回了四十万元，立即就可发工资。同时，还从公社、大队公益金中抽出现金四千六百多元，帮助困难户解决了棉衣和雨具困难。全公社组织二千二百个学生，利用课余时间采回了栗子、荆广藤等蒸酒的代用品九万八千斤，加工出白酒六千斤。供销部和粮食部也组织力量为春节加工了两万多斤副食品。各大队还组织专业队捞鱼。
    为了进一步密切党群关系，公社党委以书记为首，组织了包括各部门负责人以及各大队总支书记等四十人的慰问团，深入工地、食堂进行访问，倾听群众意见。党委第一书记周政和到柳山大队的庆丰食堂访问时，发现这个食堂柴火贮备不足，当晚就和群众商量，决定组织突击。
    通过对春节前后生产和生活的具体安排，以及大张旗鼓的向社员开展宣传后，群众生产干劲越来越大，大大推动了当前的生产运动。
