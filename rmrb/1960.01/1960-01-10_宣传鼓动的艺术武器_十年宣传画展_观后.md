    The Art Weapon of Propaganda and Mobilization
    ——After Viewing the "Ten-Year Propaganda Painting Exhibition"
    Ma Ke
    In China's plastic arts, propaganda painting is a relatively young genre, but it is full of vitality and has a strong and vigorous fighting power. The "Ten-Year Propaganda Painting Exhibition" recently held in Beijing is a general review of propaganda paintings. Although this exhibition only displayed more than one hundred and eighty political propaganda paintings and a few movie posters published in various places, the number was not large, but it clearly showed the development of propaganda paintings in our country. When we visited the exhibition in the order of the creation dates of the works, we could not help but be delighted by the rapid growth of propaganda paintings year by year. What is particularly gratifying to us is that most of the authors of these paintings are young painters who have been trained and grown up in New China, such as Qian Daxin, Zhang Ruji, Ha Qiongwen, Yang Wenxiu, Li Hongren, Zhan Jianjun, Gu Zhujun and others who are excellent authors. With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, the creation of propaganda paintings also entered a new stage, which is mainly reflected in the increase in quantity, the improvement of quality, the richer and broader subject matter of the works, and more diverse forms and expressions. At the same time, due to the collaboration between painters, editors and publishing work, the coordination between propaganda paintings and real struggles has become closer and faster. For example, the Tianjin Fine Arts Publishing House, in cooperation with the publicity of the national steelmaking campaign, took only twelve hours from the creation, publication to the distribution of a painting, which made the propaganda and mobilization function of the work more powerful.
    It can also be seen from the exhibition that propaganda paintings in our country have always closely cooperated with political movements and production struggles, and actively used the advanced ideas of the Party to inspire and educate the masses. Since the founding of the country, whether it is the period of socialist revolution and construction, the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea and strive for lasting world peace, or the people's communization and the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production under the illumination of the general line, almost every major political movement and call has been reflected in propaganda paintings in a timely and prominent manner. Because these paintings mostly reflect issues closely related to the lives of hundreds of millions of people through vivid artistic images and vivid titles, they are very popular among the masses and are very effective in publicity. For example, during the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, works such as "Tell Volunteer Army Uncles About Your Academic Achievements" (by Jiang Zhaohe) and "We Love Peace" (designed by Que Wen) had a very deep and broad impact. At that time, on the walls of the Volunteer Army Headquarters on the Korean front, in the tunnel fortifications under gunfire, in the wards of field hospitals and in sentry posts, "We Love Peace" was posted everywhere. Some soldiers even expressed "For the children of the motherland, we must persevere to the end!" while facing this painting at the critical moment of defending the position! Many excellent propaganda paintings in our country have completed their missions in actual struggles in this way. Good propaganda paintings can not only play a role in political movements and struggles against the enemy, but also have a huge inspiring force in socialist construction and daily life.
    Propaganda paintings are different from some painting works that require readers to carefully appreciate them in order to be appreciated and educated; they often use concise forms and clear images to make people understand the content of the propaganda. But conciseness is not simplification, and clarity is not exhaustive. Whether a work can inspire people depends on whether the author has profound political understanding and ingenious artistic attainments. Propaganda painting is not a simple illustration of political slogans, but a creative expression of the Party's policy spirit with artistic images. It requires clarity, accuracy, few strokes and many ideas, and conciseness. Many successful works in the exhibition prove this point. However, there are also a small number of works that do not have the power to mobilize and persuade people because the author's political understanding is shallow and the understanding of the characteristics of propaganda paintings is not enough. In terms of expressive techniques, some ignore the characteristic that everything in propaganda paintings should be condensed and concentrated, treat everything on the screen equally, and as a result, the theme and image are not clear, and it is difficult to leave any impression on people. Some only make changes in form and color, expressing superficiality and superficiality. Therefore, while opposing the tendency of cumbersome naturalism, we must also prevent the bias of excessively circling in form. In creation, we need to adhere to the clear ideological nature and full combat effectiveness of propaganda paintings, and at the same time further strengthen the national style of the works, so that this weapon will be more sharp and play a greater role in the cause of socialist construction.

    宣传鼓动的艺术武器
    ——“十年宣传画展”观后
    马克
    在我国的造型艺术中，宣传画是比较年青的画种，但是它生气勃勃，具有强烈旺盛的战斗力。最近在北京举行的“十年宣传画展”，就是宣传画的一次总检阅。这次虽然只展出了各地出版的一百八十余张政治宣传画和少数电影招贴，幅数不多，然而已明显地看出了我国宣传画发展的面貌。当我们在展览会中按着作品创作年代的顺序参观时，不禁为宣传画一年比一年迅速的成长而感到欣喜。特别值得我们高兴的是这些画的作者大多数都是新中国培养成长起来的青年画家，如钱大昕、张汝济、哈琼文、杨文秀、李宏仁、詹建俊、顾祝君等就是优秀的作者。1958年随着工农业生产的大跃进，宣传画的创作也进入了一个新的阶段，这主要表现在数量增多，质量提高，作品的题材内容更加丰富广阔，形式和表现方法也更为多种多样；同时，由于画家、编辑和出版工作之间的协作，使宣传画和现实斗争的配合也更密切和迅速。例如天津美术出版社，在配合全民炼钢运动的宣传中，一张画从创作、出版到发行，一共只用了十二个小时，这样便使作品宣传鼓动的功能更加有力了。
    从展览会还可看到我国的宣传画，一贯紧密配合政治运动和生产斗争，积极以党的先进思想鼓舞和教育群众的特色。建国以来，不论是社会主义革命和建设时期，不论是抗美援朝和争取世界持久和平的斗争，也不论是在总路线照耀下的人民公社化和工农业生产大跃进等等，几乎每一次重大的政治运动和号召，都在宣传画中得到及时而又突出的表现。由于这些画大都通过鲜明的艺术形象和生动的标题，反映了与亿万人民生活息息相关的问题，所以很为群众欢迎，在宣传中收效也很大。例如在抗美援朝运动中，“把学习成绩告诉志愿军叔叔”（蒋兆和作）和“我们热爱和平”（阙文设计）等作品就有很深广的影响。当时，在朝鲜前线志愿军指挥部的墙壁上，在枪林弹雨的坑道工事里，在野战医院的病室和哨棚中，到处都张贴着“我们热爱和平”这张画。甚至有的战士在坚守阵地的紧要关头，还对着这张画表示“为了祖国的孩子，要坚持到底！”我国许多优秀的宣传画，就是这样在实际斗争中去完成它的使命的。好的宣传画，不仅在政治运动和对敌斗争中能发挥作用，而且在社会主义建设和日常生活中，也有巨大的鼓舞力量。
    宣传画不同于有些绘画作品需要读者细细品味，才能欣赏和受到教育；而常常是以简洁的形式和一目了然的形象，使人领会宣传的内容。但是简洁不是简单化，一目了然也不是一览无余。一幅作品能不能够鼓动人心，要看作者有没有深刻的政治认识和精心独创的艺术造诣。宣传画不是政治口号的单纯图解，而是用艺术形象创造性地表现党的政策精神。它要求鲜明、准确，笔少意多，言简意赅。展览会中许多成功的作品都证明了这一点。可是也还有小部分作品由于作者政治认识较浅和对宣传画的特点理解不够，致使作品没有鼓动说服人的力量。在表现手法上，有的是忽略了宣传画中一切都应该凝聚而集中的特点，平均地对待画面上的一切，结果主题和形象都不鲜明，很难给人留下什么印象。有的是只在形式和色彩上变花样，表现浮浅和表面化。所以我们在反对繁琐的自然主义倾向的同时，也要防止过分在形式方面兜圈子的偏向，在创作中需要坚持宣传画的鲜明思想性以及饱满的战斗力，同时还要进一步加强作品的民族风格，使这把武器更加犀利，在社会主义的建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
