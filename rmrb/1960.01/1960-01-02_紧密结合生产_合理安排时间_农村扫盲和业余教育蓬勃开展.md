Xinhua News Agency, January 1st: Under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, the mass spare-time learning movement in rural areas across the country is developing rapidly and extensively. According to incomplete statistics as of December 29, 1959, the number of young and middle-aged farmers participating in literacy campaigns and spare-time learning nationwide has exceeded 100 million, more than double the number of students enrolled in October. Currently, various regions are strengthening consolidation efforts for those who have already joined the learning programs, ensuring they persist in their studies and gradually improving the quality of teaching. They are also continuing to mobilize and organize those who are eligible but have not yet participated to join the learning programs.

Since the winter of 1959, the main characteristics of the rural mass spare-time learning movement have been: early action, strong drive, rapid progress, and good quality. After the Ministry of Education convened a conference on rural literacy and spare-time education in late October 1959, various regions promptly convened various meetings, made specific arrangements, and widely used wired broadcasting, rallies to advance culture, and small-scale performances to deeply promote and mobilize the masses, combining the tasks of agricultural modernization with the current central work, quickly setting off a mass learning upsurge. In most provinces, cities, and autonomous regions such as Fujian, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia, the majority of young and middle-aged farmers who are able to enroll have already been organized to do so. In Henan Province, the number of farmers enrolled has reached over 13 million, accounting for more than 80% of the rural young and middle-aged population. Everywhere, people can see the moving scenes of male and female commune members seizing every bit of spare time to study diligently, filled with both production enthusiasm and learning enthusiasm.

Currently, the rural mass spare-time learning movement is both vigorous and down-to-earth. Party committees at all levels have further strengthened their leadership over literacy and spare-time education, with Party committee secretaries taking the lead, the whole Party taking action, and the universal establishment of leadership organizations for spare-time education. Cadres have been assigned, and efforts are being made to actively organize the ranks of people-run school teachers and cultivate and train teachers. Among the sixty-five counties and cities in Fujian Province, fifty-six counties and cities have established cultural revolution committees or worker-peasant cultural learning committees. Communes have also universally established cultural and educational departments or leading groups, led by Party committee secretaries, and assigned full-time cadres to carry out the work. In Hebei Province, full-time cadres for spare-time education have been assigned from the county, commune, management area, to the production team. The province has also trained 252,000 backbone people-run teachers and organized 1.06 million instructors and "little teachers," creating conditions for carrying out the mass spare-time learning movement. Party committees at all levels have also universally adopted effective leadership methods such as typical experiments, on-site meetings, inspections and evaluations, setting up pace-setters, and focusing on both ends to drive the middle, promptly summarizing experience, discovering problems, and improving work. Since December, each special zone, county, and city in Heilongjiang Province has dispatched a large number of cadres to form inspection teams, led personally by the Party committee secretary, to conduct in-depth and extensive inspections, holding on-site meetings wherever experience is found, and immediately promoting it. The Party committee secretaries of Yulin and Yan'an Special Zones in Shaanxi Province inspected the spare-time learning situation of farmers while inspecting production work. Therefore, the mass spare-time learning movement in various regions is not only progressing rapidly, but also has relatively good quality. For example, more than 1,400 "iron people-run schools" have emerged in Fujian Province alone. At the same time, various regions have also paid special attention to the consolidation and improvement work after mass literacy, closely connecting the elimination of illiteracy with the popularization of spare-time elementary education. Many regions immediately organize those who have become literate to transfer to spare-time elementary schools to continue their studies. Some regions have also set up a number of spare-time secondary schools and spare-time universities according to local conditions.

Since the winter of 1959, the spare-time learning movement of rural masses in various regions has been closely integrated with winter production. In many regions, production organizations and learning organizations are combined, with "one team of people, two tasks," going all the way to the bottom, overcoming the phenomenon of separation between production and learning. Various regions have also combined the characteristics of movements such as rectification of communes, manure accumulation, and water conservancy construction to carry out teaching activities, and reasonably arranged production and learning time according to the principle of "learn more in slack seasons, learn less in busy seasons, and learn flexibly in extremely busy seasons." Party committees at all levels attach great importance to seizing the favorable conditions of concentrated production such as winter water conservancy construction, and vigorously carrying out literacy and spare-time education work on construction sites. Due to the unified arrangements of the leadership, the enrollment rate of more than 3 million laborers on water conservancy construction sites in Shaanxi Province reached 90%. Currently, enthusiastic cultural learning has been universally launched on large and small water conservancy construction sites across the country. All construction sites have put forward resounding slogans: "Stand up to fight nature, sit down to advance culture." The laborers are determined to leave their "illiteracy hats" on the construction sites.

    紧密结合生产  合理安排时间
    农村扫盲和业余教育蓬勃开展
    新华社1日讯　全国各地农村群众业余学习运动，在各级党委和政府的领导下，迅速和广泛地开展起来。据1959年12月29日不完全统计，全国参加扫盲和业余学习的青壮年农民，已经超过一亿人，比10月份入学人数增加了一倍多。目前，各地正在对已参加学习的人加强巩固工作，使他们坚持学习下去，并逐步提高教学质量；对有条件而尚未参加学习的人，继续动员和组织他们参加学习。
    1959年冬季以来，农村群众业余学习运动的主要特点是：行动早，干劲足，进展快，质量好。1959年10月下旬教育部召开农村扫盲和业余教育会议后，各地就及时召开了各种会议，进行具体部署，普遍运用有线广播、向文化进军大会、小演唱等文艺形式，结合农业现代化的任务和当前中心工作，深入宣传动员，迅速掀起了群众性的学习高潮。福建、河北、山东、山西、河南、黑龙江、江苏、甘肃、内蒙古等多数省、市、自治区的青壮年农民，能入学的大部分都已组织入学。河南省农民入学人数已达一千三百余万人，占农村青壮年的80％以上。各地群众一方面生产干劲冲天，一方面学习热情饱满，到处都能看到男女社员们抓紧每一点空隙时间，认真学习的动人情景。
    目前农村群众业余学习运动，既是轰轰烈烈，又是扎扎实实。各级党委都进一步加强了对扫盲和业余教育工作的领导，党委书记挂帅，全党动手，普遍建立了业余教育的领导机构，配备了干部，积极组织民校教师队伍和培养训练师资。福建省六十五个县、市中，已有五十六个县、市成立了文化革命委员会或工农文化学习委员会，公社也普遍成立了文教部或领导小组，由党委书记挂帅，配备专职干部进行工作。河北省各地从县、公社、管理区到生产队，也都配备了业余教育专职干部；全省还培养了骨干民师二十五万二千人，组织辅导员、小先生一百零六万人，为开展群众业余学习运动创造了条件。各级党委还普遍采用了典型试验、现场会议、检查评比、树立标兵、抓两头带中间等行之有效的领导方法，及时总结经验，发现问题，改进工作。黑龙江省自12月份以来，各专区、县、市都抽调了大批干部组成检查团，由党委书记亲自带队，进行深入、广泛的检查，发现哪里有经验，便在哪里召开现场会议，立即推广。陕西省榆林、延安两专区的地委书记，在检查生产工作的同时，还检查农民的业余学习情况。因此各地的群众业余学习运动，不仅进展快，而且质量也比较好。如福建一省就涌现出“铁民校”一千四百多所。同时，各地还特别注意了群众扫盲之后的巩固提高工作，把扫除文盲和普及业余初等教育紧密连接起来。许多地区扫除一批文盲之后，就立即组织他们转入业余初等学校，继续学习。有的地区还根据当地条件，办起了一批业余中等学校和业余高等学校。
    1959年冬季以来，各地农村群众的业余学习运动，紧密地结合冬季生产进行。许多地区生产组织与学习组织相结合，“一套人马，两个任务”，一杆子插到底，克服了生产与学习脱节的现象。各地还结合整社、积肥、水利建设等运动的特点来开展教学活动，并根据“闲时多学、忙时少学、大忙机动学”的原则，合理地安排了生产和学习时间。各级党委十分重视抓紧冬季兴修水利等集中生产的有利条件，在工地上大力开展扫盲和业余教育工作。陕西省水利工地上的三百多万民工，由于领导的统一安排，入学率达到90％。目前全国大小水利工地上，已普遍展开了热火朝天的文化学习。各工地都提出了响亮的口号：“站起来向自然搏斗，坐下来向文化进军”，民工们都下决心要把文盲“帽子”丢在工地上。
