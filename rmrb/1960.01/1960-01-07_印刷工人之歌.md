    Song of the Printing Workers
    A Single Lead Type is a Star
  A single lead type is a star,
  Millions of lead types shine brightly, lead types arranged into the General Line,
  Illuminating the hearts of 600 million people.
    Bai Chun, Shanghai Xinhua Printing Factory
    Picking Stars from the Shelf
  A field of stars on the lead type shelf,
  The stars gaze at the typesetter,
  The typesetter's hands fly,
  Picking stars from the shelf.
      ×　×　×
  Picking stars from the shelf,
  A shelf full of stars transforms into poems and essays,
  The poems and essays sing of the Great Leap Forward,
  Conveying wonderful news and songs of praise.
      Jiang Hao, Inner Mongolia Printing Factory

    印刷工人之歌一只铅字一颗星
  一只铅字一颗星，
  千万铅字放光明，铅字排成总路线，
  照亮六亿人民心。
    上海新华印刷厂　柏春
    摘落架上颗颗星
  铅字架上一片星，
  星星望着排字工，
  排字工人飞双手，
  摘落架上颗颗星。
      ×　×　×
  摘落架上颗颗星，
  满架星星变诗文，
  诗文歌唱大跃进，
  传送奇闻颂歌声。
      内蒙古印刷厂　江浩
