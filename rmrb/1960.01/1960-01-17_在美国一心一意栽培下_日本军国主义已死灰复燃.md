Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: This correspondent reports: The U.S.-Japan reactionaries are about to sign a new "Security Treaty" on January 19th. The conclusion of this U.S.-Japan military alliance marks the revival of Japanese militarism under the long-term support of U.S. imperialism. The new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" indicates that Japan has been listed as a formal member of the U.S. aggressive military bloc, undertaking the obligation to send troops abroad and fight alongside the United States. The new treaty stipulates that Japan must develop its armed forces and take "common action" with the United States to deal with "armed attacks."

According to the "Security Treaty" revised by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, it will no longer be like the current U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," where the United States unilaterally "defends" Japan and Japan only provides military bases. Instead, Japan will act as cannon fodder, actively assisting the United States in carrying out aggressive wars in the Far East. Nobusuke Kishi has blatantly stated that Japan "sending troops abroad does not violate the constitution," that the Japanese army "can be dispatched on the high seas," and can be sent abroad to "attack enemy bases."

Currently, the Japanese army is stepping up the equipping of missiles in accordance with the U.S.'s war preparation requirements, in order to achieve nuclear armament. The second six-year arms expansion plan formulated by the Kishi Nobusuke government based on the new U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty stipulates that all Japanese land, sea, and air forces will be fully equipped with missiles by 1965, and the army's organization will be reorganized into "five-unit atomic divisions." The Kishi Nobusuke government has already imported fourteen "Sidewinder" missiles from the United States to equip the Japanese Air Force and has established the first "rocket training team" to train core personnel to operate nuclear weapons. It is also planning to build Japan's first missile launch site on Niijima Island outside Tokyo Bay.

Japan's military industry is also developing in the direction of manufacturing modern weapons. Munitions companies of monopoly groups such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo are vying to trial-produce various missiles, attempting to seize high profits in missile production. The "Defense Production Research Association," a joint organization of Japanese military industry groups, has submitted a report planning to expand the total value of Japanese military production to three times its current value within six years, of which the total value of missile production will increase from 200 million yen to 15 billion yen, an increase of seventy-five times.

The forces of Japanese militarism are now fully fledged and eager to act. The danger of the Japanese army cooperating with the U.S. military in aggressive wars in the Far East has become a real possibility.

Japanese militarism, once defeated by world peace forces, has revived after the war under the protection and support of the United States, in order to make it an accomplice and military base for U.S. aggression in Asia.

After launching the war of aggression against Korea, the United States forcibly concluded a separate peace treaty with Japan at the San Francisco Conference in September 1951, and signed a "Security Treaty" with Japan. The purpose was to clear the way for the unbridled rearmament of Japan and to obtain legal status for the long-term maintenance of military bases in Japan. Since then, the forces of Japanese militarism have been increasingly restored and have continuously assisted U.S. aggression activities. For example, during the war of aggression against Korea, the entire Japan became a major supply station for the U.S. military invading Korea, and the Japanese military industry provided a total of 1.33 billion U.S. dollars of military supplies and munitions to the U.S. military invading Korea, playing the role of a supply base.

Since Nobusuke Kishi came to power in 1957, he has further leaned towards the United States and intensified the revival of militarist forces. Now, the economic foundation of Japanese militarism—the strength and concentration of monopoly capital—have exceeded pre-war levels. Japan's production level has reached three times that of pre-war. The number of Japanese land, sea, and air forces has reached 251,000, with 1,194 aircraft and 404 ships (totaling 110,000 tons). Due to the modernization of weapons and equipment, the firepower of a division of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" has increased to seven to eight times that of the Japanese army's invasion of Northeast China. The military industry has also made great progress, with current production capacity reaching 100 billion yen.

In addition, Japan currently has 130,000 armed police, a number far exceeding the total of 56,000 police officers before Japan's surrender. The groups of militarist elements have not only not been disbanded after the war, but their activities have become increasingly rampant. At present, there are 200 former military organizations distributed throughout the country. Among them, the "Japan Compatriots League" led by Okamura Neiji, a war criminal who invaded China, has a total of 1.5 million members.

Japanese militarist elements serve as senior commanders and backbone in the Japanese army, and they control the command of the Japanese army. According to statistics, among the officers above major in the "Self-Defense Forces," former military personnel account for 49.9% in the army, 95.5% in the navy, and 64.4% in the air force. The chiefs of staff of the three services are all former military personnel. These militarist elements are doing their best to advocate amending the constitution, implementing nuclear armament, and carrying out foreign aggression. Tojo Hideki's secretary, Army Colonel Hattori Takushiro, openly published articles in magazines, clamoring that the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" should not only be equipped with weapons such as radar, but also with missiles with nuclear warheads and offensive submarines.

Japanese modern history proves that concluding a military alliance with another stronger imperialist country has always been a prelude to Japanese militarism carrying out foreign aggression. Japanese militarism waged war against Tsarist Russia after concluding the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1902; launched a large-scale offensive against China after concluding the German-Japanese Alliance in 1936; and launched the Pacific War and invaded Southeast Asia after concluding the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance in 1940. Now, the revived Japanese militarism's formation of a U.S.-Japan military alliance with U.S. imperialism is precisely for a comeback. This is something that the people of Asian countries who have suffered from the trampling of Japanese militarism cannot but seriously be vigilant about.

### 在美国一心一意栽培下  日本军国主义已死灰复燃

    在美国一心一意栽培下
    日本军国主义已死灰复燃
    新华社15日讯　本社记者报道：美日反动派即将在1月19日签订新的“安全条约”，这一日美军事同盟的缔结，标志着日本军国主义在美帝国主义的长期扶植下已经复活。新的日美“安全条约”表明，日本已经被列为美国侵略军事集团的正式成员，承担了派兵出国和美国共同作战的义务。新条约中规定日本要发展武装力量，和美国采取“共同行动”对付“武装进攻”。
    按照美日反动派修改的“安全条约”，就不再是像现行日美“安全条约”所规定的那样，由美国单方面来“防卫”日本，日本只提供军事基地，而是由日本充当炮灰，积极帮助美国在远东进行侵略战争。岸信介已经露骨地说，日本“派兵出国并不违反宪法”，日本军队“可以在公海上出动”，可以派到国外去“进攻敌人的基地”。
    现在日本军队正在根据美国的备战要求，加紧装备导弹，以实现核武装化。岸信介政府根据新的日美军事同盟条约制定的第二个六年扩军计划，规定日本全部陆海空军在1965年以前全部实行导弹装备，军队编制将改编为“五单位原子师”。岸信介政府已经从美国运进了十四枚“响尾蛇”导弹装备日本空军，并且成立了第一支“火箭训练队”，训练操纵核武器的骨干。它还正在东京湾外的新岛筹建日本的第一个导弹发射场。
    日本的军需工业也在向着制造现代武器的方向发展。三菱、三井、住友等垄断集团的军火公司正在竞相试制各种导弹，企图在导弹生产中攫取高额利润。日本军火工业团体的联合机构——“防卫生产研究会”已经提出报告，计划在六年内把日本军火生产总值扩大为现在的三倍，其中导弹生产总值要从二亿日元增加到一百五十亿日元，即增加到七十五倍。
    日本军国主义势力现在羽毛已丰、蠢蠢欲动。日本军队协同美军在远东进行侵略战争的危险已经成为现实可能性。
    一度被世界和平力量击败的日本军国主义，战后是在美国庇护和扶植下复活起来的，以便使它充当美国侵略亚洲的帮凶和军事基地。
    美国在发动侵朝战争以后，于1951年9月在旧金山会议上强制缔结单独对日和约，并且与日本签订“安全条约”，目的就在于为放手重新武装日本扫清道路，并且为长期保持在日本的军事基地取得合法地位。在此以后，日本军国主义势力日益恢复，并且不断协助美国的侵略活动。例如，在侵朝战争期间，整个日本成了侵朝美军的大兵站，日本军需工业为侵朝美军总共提供了十三亿三千万美元的军火和军需品，起着供应基地的作用。
    1957年岸信介上台以来，进一步投靠美国，加紧复活军国主义势力。现在，日本军国主义的经济基础——垄断资本的力量和集中程度都超过了战前水平。日本的生产水平已经达到战前的三倍。日本陆海空军的人数已经达到二十五万一千人，拥有飞机一千一百九十四架，舰艇四百零四艘（共十一万吨）。由于武器装备近代化，日本“自卫队”一个师团的火力已经增强为日本军队侵略中国东北时的七至八倍。军需工业也有了很大的发展，目前生产能力已达一千亿日元。
    此外，日本目前还有十三万武装警察，这个数目已经远远超过了日本投降前的警察总数五万六千人。军国主义分子的团体战后不仅没有解散，而且活动日益猖獗。目前日本共有二百个旧军人组织分布在全国各地。其中侵华战犯冈村宁次领导的“日本乡友联盟”共有会员一百五十万人。
    日本军国主义分子在日本军队中充任高级指挥官和骨干，他们掌握着日本军队的指挥权。据统计，现在“自卫队”里面少佐以上的军官中，旧军人在陆军中占49．9％，在海军中占95．5％，在空军中占64．4％。三军幕僚长（参谋长）全是旧军人出身。这些军国主义分子竭力鼓吹修改宪法、实行核武装和对外进行侵略。东条英机的秘书、陆军大佐服部卓四郎公开在杂志上发表文章，叫嚷日本“自卫队”不仅应装备雷达等武器，而且应装备带核弹头的导弹和进攻的潜水艇。
    日本近代史证明：同另一个较强的帝国主义国家缔结军事同盟，总是日本军国主义向国外进行侵略的前奏。日本军国主义在1902年缔结了日英同盟后同帝俄发生了战争；在1936年缔结了日德同盟后向中国大举进攻，在1940年缔结了日德意军事同盟后发动了太平洋战争，侵略东南亚。现在，复活了的日本军国主义同美帝国主义结成日美军事同盟正是为了卷土重来。这是曾经遭受过日本军国主义蹂躏的亚洲各国人民所不能不严重警惕的。
