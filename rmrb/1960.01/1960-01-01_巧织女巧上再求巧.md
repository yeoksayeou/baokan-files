Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 31st: In the textile cities of Baqiao and Xianyang in Xi'an, textile workers are determined to quickly master the new Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method, and create even better production achievements in the new year. After work, one can often see girls walking while reading booklets about work methods, or practicing knotting yarn ends with a bit of yarn.

The other day, in the canteen of the State-owned No. 3 Cotton Mill, two girls were chatting non-stop while waiting in line to buy food. They were so engrossed that they forgot to buy food when they reached the window, and they didn't respond even when the canteen server urged them several times. These were Luo Yufang and Yan Xiuhua, production experts from the spinning workshop, and they were discussing the technical theory of the new "Hao Jianxiu Work Method." Luo Yufang has been selected as an advanced producer in the factory for four consecutive years. She is determined to use the new Hao Jianxiu Work Method to create new production achievements at the very beginning of 1960. For several weeks, in addition to her work hours, she has been spending several more hours in the workshop every day, practicing new techniques for changing roving and knotting. With her help, all the workers in her group achieved excellent results in the most recent technical theory examination on the new work method.

    巧织女巧上再求巧
    据新华社西安31日电　在西安灞桥和咸阳这两座纺织城，纺织工人们决心迅速掌握新的郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法，在新的一年内创造出更好的生产成就。在下班的时候，常常可以看到一些姑娘一边走路，一边拿着工作法小册子诵读，或是拿一把纱头练习接头。
    最近的一天，在国棉三厂食堂里，有两个姑娘一面排队买饭，一面滔滔地说个不停，走近窗口也忘了买饭，食堂服务员催她们几声都没理会。这是细纱车间的生产能手罗玉芳和阎秀花，她们是在问答新的“郝建秀工作法”的技术理论哩。罗玉芳已经连续四年被选为厂内的先进生产者了，她决心在1960年一开头，就采用新的郝建秀工作法创造出新的生产成绩。几个星期以来，她每天除了上班以外，都要在车间多呆几个小时，练习换粗纱和接头的新技术。在她的帮助下，全小组的工人在最近一次新工作法技术理论考试中，成绩都是优良。
