Fruit Abundance Depends on Cultivation
Jiangjin Orange Orchard Massively Raises Pigs to Fertilize Orchards

(Reported by our newspaper) Under the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward, Jiangjin County, Sichuan, famous for its Guanggan oranges, has fully utilized the advantages of the people's communes – being large in scale and collective in nature – to overcome an unprecedented severe drought. As a result, the 1959 Guanggan harvest was again abundant, with a total output of 23,170,000 jin, an increase of 4.5% compared to 1958 (a bumper year).

Guanggan production has historically had a distinction between large and small harvest years, and some people believe this is an immutable law. However, Jiangjin County's actual experience last year proved that as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, break through conservative thinking, and strengthen cultivation and management immediately after a large harvest, we can completely eliminate the difference between large and small harvest years and achieve abundant harvests every year. Guanggan oranges are a specialty of Jiangjin and an important export commodity. The Jiangjin County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the principle of "promoting fruit with grain, and giving equal importance to grain and fruit," strengthened its leadership over Guanggan production. The secretary took the lead, with the Department of Agriculture and Industry taking specific responsibility. The county established a fruit tree station to guide fruit tree production techniques. In leading citrus production, Jiangjin County conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, which focused on grasping the situation from the beginning. It successively convened several fruit tree production meetings, and debates were held on issues such as whether the large and small harvest years of citrus fruits were a law? Can it be eliminated? And how to eliminate it? Through the methods of observing, debating, learning, and doing, technology was imparted, experiences were exchanged, understanding was improved, and confidence in exceeding the large harvest year in the small harvest year was established. At the same time, 407 mu of "command fields" were established at all levels, powerfully promoting production.

In the process of strengthening the cultivation and management of Guanggan oranges, applying fertilizer in large quantities and multiple times in stages is an important key to increasing production. In order to ensure that citrus fruits have sufficient fertilizer, the contradiction of grain and fruit competing for fertilizer must first be resolved. They adhered to the principle of self-reliance and dedicated fertilizer for dedicated use. Fruit tree professional teams raised pigs in large numbers, used the open space in the orchards to plant feed, raised pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and achieved "one pig for ten trees, fertilizing the orchard with the orchard." At the same time, green manure was vigorously promoted, and a "three handfuls of grass per person per day" campaign was launched to ensure that bearing trees and non-bearing trees were fertilized three to five times, and foliar fertilization was carried out one to three times. The command fields and high-yield fields were fertilized six to ten times, with an average of 300 to 400 jin of chemical fertilizer and liquid manure applied to each plant, meeting the nutrient needs of the fruit trees. In late September of last year, late-stage management was also intensified, and a campaign to rush to apply fruit-strengthening fertilizer was launched with the aim of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale. Strengthening late-stage fertilization played a significant role in strengthening the fruit and increasing production. For example, after the Zhenwu Commune in this county applied fruit-strengthening fertilizer on a large scale, the fruit trees underwent a major transformation, and the harvest increased by 10% compared to 1958, achieving a small harvest year exceeding a large harvest year.

### 江津桔园大量养猪以园养园

    果品丰收靠培育
    江津桔园大量养猪以园养园
    本报讯　盛产广柑的四川江津县，在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，充分发挥了人民公社一大二公的优越性，战胜了数十年来未有过的大旱灾，使1959年广柑又获得了丰收，总产量达到二千三百十七万斤，比1958年（大年）增加4．5％。
    广柑生产历来有大、小年的区别，有些人认为这是不可改变的规律。但江津县去年的实际经验证明：只要坚持政治挂帅，突破保守思想，在大年收果以后，立即加强培护管理，就完全能够消除大、小年的差别，实现年年大丰收。广柑是江津的特产，是重要的出口物资之一。中共江津县委根据“以粮带果，粮果并举”的原则，加强了对广柑生产的领导，由书记挂帅，农工部具体负责，县设果树站，指导果树生产技术。江津县在领导柑桔生产中，认真贯彻了中共四川省委一开始就抓紧的精神，先后召开了几次果树生产会议，针对柑桔大小年是不是规律？能不能消灭？如何消灭等问题进行了辩论，通过看、辩、学、干的办法，传授技术，交流经验，提高了认识，树立了小年能超大年的信心。同时，层层大搞了指挥田四百零七亩，有力地推动了生产。
    在加强广柑的培护管理过程中，分期大量多次追肥是增产的重要关键。为了保证柑桔有足够的肥料，首先解决粮果争肥的矛盾。他们坚持自力更生、专肥专用的原则，由果树专业队大量养猪，利用果园空地种植饲料，养猪积肥，实现“十树一猪，以园养园”。同时大搞泡青肥，开展“一人一天三把草”运动，保证了结果树和未结果树施肥三至五次，根外追肥一至三次，指挥田丰产田施肥达六至十次，平均每株共施化肥和水粪等三百至四百斤，满足了果树需要的养分。去年9月下旬，又大抓后期管理，以反右倾、鼓干劲为纲，掀起了抢施壮果肥运动。由于加强后期施肥，对壮大果实，增加产量起了很大作用。如这个县的真武公社在大施壮果肥以后，果树有了很大转变，收获量比1958年增长10％，实现了小年超大年。
