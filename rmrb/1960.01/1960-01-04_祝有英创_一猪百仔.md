Congratulations to Zhu Youying for Creating "One Sow, One Hundred Piglets"

Zhu Youying, a feeder at the Quan Town Youth Livestock Farm in Acheng County, Heilongjiang Province, has set a high record of one sow breeding three generations in one year, with a total of one hundred and twelve piglets, including offspring and descendants.

In the autumn of 1957, Zhu Youying joined the livestock industry front shortly after graduating from school. At first, she was responsible for raising chickens and rabbits, and later she raised pigs. Some people ridiculed her: "A young girl is feeding pigs!" Hearing this, she wavered and felt discouraged. Later, Party and government leaders helped her realize that raising pigs was also an important undertaking, and she made up her mind to do it for the rest of her life.

When Zhu Youying started the experiment of breeding one hundred piglets per sow per year, many people did not believe it could succeed. However, encouraged by the Party, and thinking that she was a member of the Communist Youth League, she had to dare to think and dare to act, and not bow her head in the face of difficulties. So, she proposed to the Party branch the requirement of using one sow for the experiment, which was supported by the Party. On January 5, 1958, Zhu Youying adopted the methods of heat mating, double mating, and repeated mating to breed the sow. After one hundred and fourteen days, the sow successfully gave birth to the first litter of fourteen piglets. On the third day after the first litter was born, she began to breed the sow again. When the sow did not show signs of estrus, she separated the piglets from the sow and drove the boar into the sow's pen to stimulate estrus. In less than a day, the sow showed signs of estrus and mating was successfully carried out. The second litter produced twelve piglets. On the sixth day after the second litter was born, she used the same method to breed the old sow; at the same time, she also bred the first litter of young sows. While the large sow was producing the third litter, nine young sows also produced seventy-two piglets. By the end of 1958, the large and small sows had successively produced one hundred and twelve piglets, with a survival rate of 97%, which was an increase of eighty-four piglets compared to the past when each sow only produced twenty-eight piglets per year, and the breeding rate increased by three times.

The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to Comrade Zhu Youying's advanced experience in creating "one sow, one hundred piglets" and decided to promote it throughout the city.

Comrade Zhu Youying stated that in 1960, she would breed fifteen to twenty sows in the farm to produce one hundred piglets per year, and train sixty feeders with the same level as herself. Promote the development of the "one sow, one hundred piglets" movement, so that the sow's litter rate in the whole farm will increase by two and a half to three times compared with 1959, and the survival rate will increase from 90% to 97%.

### 祝有英创“一猪百仔”

    祝有英创“一猪百仔”
    黑龙江阿城县泉镇青年畜牧场饲养员祝有英，创造了一头母猪在一年内繁殖三代，连子带孙共一百一十二头的高纪录。
    1957年秋天，祝有英从学校毕业不久，就走上了畜牧业战线。起先，她负责饲养鸡、兔，后来才养猪。有些人讽刺她：“大姑娘喂上猪啦！”她听了，有些动摇、灰心。后来党、政领导干部帮助她，使她认识到养猪也是一项重要事业，她下定了决心要干一辈子。
    祝有英搞一猪一年繁殖百仔的试验，开始很多人不相信能成功。可是在党的鼓舞下，想到自己是个共青团员，要敢想敢干，不能在困难面前低头。于是向党支部提出了要一头母猪作试验的要求，得到了党的支持。1958年1月5日，祝有英采取了热配、双配、重配的办法给猪配种。经过一百一十四天，母猪顺利地产下了第一胎十四个仔猪。在第一窝产后的第三天，又开始给这头母猪配种。母猪不发情，她就把仔猪与母猪隔离开，把种猪赶到母猪舍去逗情，不到一天的时间母猪就发情了，顺利地进行了交配，第二窝又产了十二头小猪。第二窝产后的第六天，她又采取同样办法给老母猪配种；同时又给第一窝小母猪配种。大母猪产第三窝的同时，九头小母猪也产了七十二头仔猪。到1958年底，大小母猪先后共产一百一十二头小猪，成活率达到97％，比过去每头母猪每年只产二十八头仔猪增加了八十四头，繁殖率提高了三倍。
    中共哈尔滨市委很重视祝有英同志创造“一猪百仔”的先进经验，决定在全市推广。
    祝有英同志表示，在1960年要在本场搞十五头到二十头一年繁殖百仔的母猪，并培养六十名和自己水平相等的饲养员。推动“一猪一年繁殖百仔”运动的开展，使全场母猪产仔率比1959年增加两倍半到三倍，成活率由90％提高到97％。
