Xinhua News Agency, Haiphong, 10th. Tens of thousands of people's representatives from all over Vietnam gathered at the Sau Kho wharf in Haiphong this morning to warmly welcome the first group of overseas Vietnamese returning to their motherland from Thailand.

Haiphong City was decked out in festive attire today. The streets and alleys were full of flags of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and huge banners welcoming the returning overseas Vietnamese were everywhere. The Sau Kho wharf was crowded with people, colorful flags were waving, and gongs and drums were beating. As the first group of 922 overseas Vietnamese, including 530 children, gradually stepped onto the wharf, cheers and applause erupted one after another. Relatives rushed forward to embrace their parents, wives, children, and siblings whom they had been separated from for more than a decade. Flowers, tears of joy, cheers, and slogans merged into one.

A mass rally was held at the wharf to welcome the overseas Vietnamese from Thailand. The sudden arrival of Chairman Ho Chi Minh caused a thunderous cheer from the entire audience.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government, extended a warm welcome to the returning overseas Vietnamese and expressed the utmost concern of the entire party and people of Vietnam for all overseas Vietnamese in Thailand.

Subsequently, representatives of the Vietnam Red Cross, representatives of the Thai Red Cross who escorted the first group of overseas Vietnamese back to the country, Huang Youren, Chairman of the Haiphong Municipal Administrative Committee, and representatives of the overseas Vietnamese in Thailand spoke in succession. After the mass rally, representatives of both Red Cross societies held a signing ceremony for the transfer of the first group of overseas Vietnamese.

The vast majority of citizens of Haiphong flocked to the streets today to cheer the overseas Vietnamese entering the city.

The 70,000 overseas Vietnamese in Thailand are among the most advanced of the 500,000 overseas Vietnamese. The vast majority of them were forced to flee to Thailand after the Second World War due to their resistance to the French re-invasion and persecution by the colonialists. Thousands of their outstanding children later returned to China to participate in the War of Resistance against France and drove away the colonialists together with the people of their motherland.

After the restoration of peace, the overseas Vietnamese eagerly hoped to return to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to build their motherland, and with their heroic and unyielding struggle, they smashed the conspiracy of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities to repeatedly force the overseas Vietnamese to move back to South Vietnam. In addition to the early migrants to Thailand who continued to stay in Thailand, more than 60,000 of the 70,000 overseas Vietnamese have registered to return to North Vietnam. Even more than 5,000 overseas Vietnamese who originally came from South Vietnam chose the North.

    首批旅泰越侨回到海防
    胡志明主席代表党和政府表示热烈欢迎
    新华社海防10日电　越南各地人民代表数万人今天上午聚集在海防的六库码头，热烈欢迎第一批旅泰越侨回到自己祖国。
    海防市今天披上了节日的盛装。大街小巷挂满了越南民主共和国国旗，到处都是欢迎越侨归来的巨幅标语。六库码头上人山人海，彩旗招展，锣鼓喧天。当第一批九百二十二名越侨其中包括五百三十名儿童，陆续登上码头时，欢呼声和掌声一阵接着一阵，亲人们涌向前去，同分别十几年的父母妻儿和兄弟姐妹等紧紧的拥抱，鲜花热泪、欢呼声和口号声融成一片。
    在码头上举行了欢迎旅泰越侨的群众大会，胡志明主席突然的到来引起了全场震天的欢呼。
    胡志明主席代表越南劳动党和政府，对归国越侨表示热烈欢迎，并表达了越南全党全民对全体旅泰越侨的莫大关怀。
    接着，越南红十字会代表、护送第一批越侨回国的泰国红十字会代表、海防市行政委员会主席黄友仁以及旅泰越侨代表相继讲了话。群众大会结束之后，双方红十字会代表举行了移交第一批越侨的签字仪式。
    海防绝大部分市民今天拥向街头向进入市区的越侨夹道欢呼。
    七万旅泰越侨是五十万越南国外侨民中最先进的部分之一，他们绝大部分是在第二次大战后由于反抗法国的重新侵入，受到殖民者迫害，被迫逃到泰国的。他们的数千优秀子女，后来又回国参加了抗法战争，同祖国人民一起，赶走了殖民者。
    和平恢复后，越侨热切盼望回到越南民主共和国建设祖国，并以英勇不屈的斗争粉碎了美国和吴庭艳当局屡次强迫越侨迁回南越的阴谋。除了早期到泰国的侨民继续留在泰国之外，七万越侨中已有六万多人登记回越南北方。连五千多原籍南越的侨民也都选择了北方。
