    Marching Towards "High-Precision and Cutting-Edge"
    Wang Pu
    In the days since the Great Leap Forward, it has become increasingly clear that the historical process of socialist construction has been shortened. Many of the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan have been achieved three years ahead of schedule; hundreds and thousands of advanced, precise, and cutting-edge new products have also been produced far ahead of schedule, and the pace of marching towards "high-precision and cutting-edge" is accelerating.
    If asked why so many "high-precision and cutting-edge" products can be produced ahead of schedule, and why they can be successfully trial-produced and put into production in a relatively short period of time? The answer is: because we have implemented the policy of launching mass movements and "walking on two legs" in our march towards "high-precision and cutting-edge."
    Historically, major inventions and creations have mostly originated from the working people. Although they may not have read much, or even be literate, they dared to overthrow idols and were the most original. Today, the working people who have mastered their own destiny, with the leadership of the Party and the guidance of correct political thought, have creative talents and originality that are many times higher than their ancestors. Therefore, once we rely on the masses, launch mass movements, and realize the "three-in-one" combination of leading cadres, workers, and engineering technical personnel, and combine the rich practical experience of the working masses with the theoretical knowledge of engineering technical personnel, the creative talents of the masses will explode like nuclear fission, and we will be able to trial-produce more and better "high-precision and cutting-edge" products in a relatively short period of time, and push our country's production technology to new heights at an unprecedented speed.
  Vigorously developing indigenous, simple, and general products—popularization, while actively trial-producing and producing "high-precision and cutting-edge" products—improvement, this is the policy of combining popularization and improvement to accelerate socialist construction. Our economy was originally very backward, and our material and cultural living standards are still not high. Only by vigorously developing indigenous, simple, and general products can we meet the growing needs of socialist construction and the people's lives, and rapidly change the face of "poverty and blankness." However, we are communists with lofty ideals, and our ultimate goal is to build a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. We must have the ambition to climb to the peak of science and technology. Only by actively developing advanced, precise, and cutting-edge products, and arming our industry, agriculture, and transportation industries with the most advanced science and technology as quickly as possible, can we create higher labor efficiency than the most developed capitalist countries, and enable our country to become a strong socialist country in a relatively short period of time.
    The combination of popularization and improvement, improvement on the basis of popularization, and popularization under the guidance of improvement, this is the unity of opposites. Vigorously developing indigenous, simple, and general products will not only not hinder the march towards "high-precision and cutting-edge," but on the contrary, will promote the development of "high-precision and cutting-edge" products. Because the faster the development of indigenous, simple, and general products, the faster the development of the entire social production, the more urgently and universally it demands the use of advanced science and technology in production. Isn't the increasing proportion of "high-precision and cutting-edge" products among the new products successfully trial-produced in Shanghai the result of the rapid development of the national industry, which requires it to provide more and more "high-precision and cutting-edge" products? Similarly, the more "high-precision and cutting-edge" products are produced, and the faster they develop, the more they in turn promote the development of general products, and at the same time propose new development directions for popularization.
    Science and technology are constantly developing. So-called general products and "high-precision and cutting-edge" products are only spoken of in a relative sense. As time goes on, there is higher above high, more precise above precise, and more cutting-edge above cutting-edge. Today's "high-precision and cutting-edge" products will become tomorrow's general products. General products and "high-precision and cutting-edge" products coexist, and the combination of popularization and improvement, is the case now, and will be the case in the future. Starting from reality, we should vigorously popularize what needs to be popularized, and actively improve what needs to be improved. Both popularization and improvement must involve mass movements, and must fully develop the creativity and initiative of the masses. Popularization and improvement are mutually dependent and mutually promoting. Constantly equipping our industry, agriculture, and transportation industries with advanced science and technology will allow the entire social productive forces to continuously develop on a new technological basis.

    向“高精尖”进军
    王朴
    在大跃进以来的日子里，越来越使人感到社会主义建设的历史进程缩短了。第二个五年计划的许多主要指标，已经提前三年实现了；成百上千件高级的、精密的、尖端的新产品，也大大提前出了世，向“高精尖”进军的步伐越来越大了。
    若问许多“高精尖”产品为什么能够提前问世，为什么能在比较短的时间试制成功和投入生产？答曰：因为我们在向“高精尖”进军中贯彻了大搞群众运动和“两条腿走路”的方针。
    历史上的重大创造发明，大都是从劳动人民中产生出来的，他们虽然读书不多，甚至连字都认不得，然而他们敢于推翻偶像，最富有独创精神。今天，掌握了自己命运的劳动人民，有了党的领导，有了正确的政治思想指引，他们的创造才能和独创精神，不知比他们的祖先要高多少倍。所以，我们一旦依靠了群众，大搞群众运动，实现领导干部、工人、工程技术人员三结合，把职工群众的丰富实践经验与工程技术人员的理论知识结合起来，群众的创造才能就像原子核分裂一样迸射着，就能在比较短的时间试制出更多更好的“高精尖”产品来，就能以前所未有的速度把我国生产技术推向新的高峰。
  大力发展土法生产的、简易的和一般的产品——普及，同时积极试制和生产“高精尖”产品——提高，这是普及和提高相结合的加速社会主义建设的方针。我们的经济原来很落后，我们的物质生活和文化生活水平都还不高，只有大力发展土法生产的、简易的和一般的产品，才能满足社会主义建设和人民生活日益增长的需要，才能迅速地改变“一穷二白”的面貌。但是，我们是具有远大理想的共产主义者，我们最后的目标是建设一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。我们必须有攀登科学技术高峰的雄心大志。我们只有积极发展高级的、精密的、尖端的产品，尽可能快地用最先进的科学技术来武装我们的工业、农业、交通运输业，才能够创造比最发达的资本主义国家更高的劳动效率，才能够使我国在较短的时间内成为社会主义的强国。
    普及和提高相结合，在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及，这是矛盾的对立统一。大力发展土法生产的、简易的和一般的产品，不但不会妨碍向“高精尖”进军，而且相反，还会促进“高精尖”产品的发展。因为土法生产的、简易的、一般的产品发展得越快，整个社会生产发展越快，就越迫切地普遍地要求在生产中使用先进的科学技术。上海市在试制成功的新产品中，“高精尖”产品的比重越来越大，不正是全国工业迅速发展以后，要求它提供“高精尖”产品越来越多的结果吗？同样的，“高精尖”产品生产得越多，发展得越快，又反过来推动一般产品的发展，同时给普及提出了新的发展方向。
    科学技术在不断地发展着。所谓一般产品和“高精尖”产品，只是在相对的意义上讲的。随着时间的推移，高级之上有高级，精密之上有精密，尖端之上有尖端。今日的“高精尖”产品，会变成明日的一般产品。一般产品和“高精尖”产品同时存在，普及和提高相结合，现在是这样，将来也是这样。从实际出发，需要普及的就大力普及，需要提高的就积极提高。普及和提高都要大搞群众运动，都要充分发挥群众的创造性和积极性。普及和提高互相依存，互相促进，不断地以先进的科学技术装备我们的工业、农业、交通运输业，整个社会生产力就可以不断地在新的技术基础上发展了。
