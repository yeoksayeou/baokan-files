Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 20th: The first Lhasa Municipal People's Congress opened on the 19th, and the Lhasa Municipal People's Government was formally announced to be established on the same day. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, read out the decision on the formal establishment of the Lhasa Municipal People's Government on behalf of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. This decision formally appointed Trijang Losang Yeshe (Tibetan, currently Deputy Director of the Lhasa Municipal Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army) as acting Mayor of Lhasa, and Zhang Zhensheng and Wang Peisheng (Hui) as Deputy Mayors. They have already been sworn in at the meeting.

More than 100 representatives are participating in the first Lhasa Municipal People's Congress, representing the will of 170,000 people in the city's six districts and seven counties. Among the representatives are emancipated peasants and herdsmen, merchants, handicraftsmen, lamas, and patriotic upper-class figures. They were all elected by grassroots organizations of the people in various places.

This meeting will comprehensively summarize Lhasa's work in 1959 and formulate work plans for production, construction, and other aspects in 1960.

Trijang Losang Yeshe, Chairman of the Presidium of the meeting, enthusiastically outlined the tremendous changes in his hometown in the short nine months since the rebellion of the reactionary upper-class clique in Tibet was quelled in his opening speech. He pointed out that the changes in Lhasa in the nine months since the suppression of the rebellion exceeded those of the hundreds of years before liberation. Lhasa, which had always been the political and economic center of the Tibetan serf system, has now basically completed democratic reforms. The 120,000 farmers who had been treated as beasts of burden by the serf owners for generations have become the masters of more than 420,000 mu of land in the entire region. All kinds of high-interest loans that had been repaid endlessly for generations have been completely abolished or reduced in interest. The benefits gained by the citizens from the abolition of high-interest loans and interest reduction are equivalent to an average of more than 1,200 jin of grain per person. Lhasa, which used to be poor and hungry, is now full of prosperity. In these nine months, the Lhasa Municipal Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army has arranged jobs for more than 5,000 unemployed people and vagrants, and distributed more than 135,000 jin of relief grain to the vast number of poor citizens free of charge. More than 300 "pauper" households who had been wandering in the streets and alleys for a long time have now all moved into new homes and started new lives. Temples, houses, and gardens that were damaged in the rebellion launched by the reactionary upper-class clique in Tibet have all been repaired. The downtown area of Lhasa, which had been filthy and rugged for hundreds of years, has now been widened, leveled and cleaned up after renovation. Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, there was not a single formal school here. Now there are more than 150 public and private schools, and more than 7,000 serfs and their children have begun to get rid of illiteracy.

Trijang Losang Yeshe said: The vast number of working people who have been emancipated are building a prosperous, happy, democratic, and socialist new Lhasa on the ruins of the serf system with the attitude of masters.

Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, was invited to speak at the meeting. On behalf of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, he congratulated the people of Lhasa for exercising their democratic rights for the first time, and hoped that they would work actively and build a happy new life with their own hands.

He Zuyin, Deputy Secretary of the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, congratulated the meeting and made a political report to the meeting on behalf of the Municipal Committee.

The meeting will continue.

    拉萨首届人代会开幕
    会上宣布正式成立拉萨市人民政府
    新华社拉萨20日电　拉萨市首届人民代表会议于19日开幕，拉萨市人民政府也在同一天正式宣布成立。西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美在会上代表自治区筹备委员会宣读了关于正式成立拉萨市人民政府的决定。这项决定正式任命崔科·顿珠才仁（藏族，现任人民解放军拉萨市军事管制委员会副主任）为拉萨市代理市长，张振生和王沛生（回族）为副市长。他们已经在会上宣誓就职。
    参加拉萨市首届人民代表会议的代表有一百多人，他们代表着市属六个区、七个县共十七万人民的意志。代表中有翻身的农民、牧民，有商人、手工业者、喇嘛和爱国上层人士。他们都是由各地人民群众的基层组织推选产生的。
    这次会议将全面总结拉萨市1959年的工作，制定1960年的生产、建设和其他方面的工作规划。
    会议主席团主席崔科·顿珠才仁在开幕词中热情洋溢地概述了自己家乡在西藏上层反动集团的叛乱平息后短短九个月来的巨大变化。他指出平叛后拉萨九个月来的变化超过了解放前的几百年。一直是西藏农奴制度政治、经济中心的拉萨市，现在已经基本上完成了民主改革。世代为农奴主做牛做马的十二万农民，已经成为全区四十二万多亩土地的主人，祖祖辈辈偿还不尽的各种高利贷债务，已经全部废除或实行减息，市民由于废除高利贷和减息所获得的好处，折合粮食平均每人在一千二百多斤以上。过去是贫困、饥饿的拉萨，现在充满了欣欣向荣的景象。在这九个月中，人民解放军拉萨市军管会为五千多名失业者和流浪人安排了工作；为广大贫苦市民无偿发放了十三万五千多斤救济食粮。长期漂泊在大街小巷的三百多户“贫民”，现在全部迁进了新居，开始了新的生活。在西藏上层反动集团发动的叛乱中遭到破坏的寺庙、房屋和林园，已经全部修复；几百年来污秽坎坷的拉萨市区，经过整修后现在街道宽坦而洁净。西藏和平解放以前这里没有一所正规学校，现在已经有公办和民办的学校一百五十多所，有七千多名农奴和他们的子弟开始摆脱文盲状态。
    崔科·顿珠才仁说：已经翻身的广大劳动人民，以主人翁的姿态，在农奴制度的废墟上建设繁荣、幸福、民主和社会主义的新拉萨。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美应邀在会上讲话，他代表自治区筹备委员会祝贺拉萨市人民第一次行使自己的民主权利，并且希望他们积极劳动，用自己双手建设幸福的新生活。

    会议将继续举行。
