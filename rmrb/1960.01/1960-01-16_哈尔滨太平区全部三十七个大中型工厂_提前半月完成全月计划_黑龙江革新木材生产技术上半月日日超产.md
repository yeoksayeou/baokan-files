Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 15th: In recent days, the factories in Taiping District, Harbin, have been filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and brimming with joy. Workers have been sending good news to the Party, reporting that all factories in the district have comprehensively overfulfilled the January production plan ahead of schedule. This includes thirty-seven large and medium-sized factories such as the Harbin Glass Fiber Factory, Polyethylene Plastics Factory, Songjiang Rubber Factory, Songjiang Chemical Factory, Harbin Refractory Materials Factory, and Asbestos Products Factory.

In the first half of January, the output and quality of more than sixty major products produced by factories throughout the district, such as rubber shoes, canned goods, water pumps, and files, as well as the labor productivity of each factory, significantly improved compared to December of last year. No personal accidents occurred in any factory, and thirteen new products were put into production. Currently, all factories in the district are continuing to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, striving for even greater overproduction in January while actively preparing to seize a flying start for the Spring Festival and monthly success for the first quarter.

The workers in the factories of Taiping District, from the very start of work this year, have been full of energy and immediately launched into technical innovation and technical revolution movements, enabling production to leap forward at high speed. In the first half of January, the factories achieved a total of 298 major innovations, successfully created five automatic production lines, and improved 64 old pieces of equipment, increasing efficiency by a multiple from one to one hundred.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 15th: In the first half of January, Heilongjiang Province's forestry departments exceeded their timber production plans daily. The average daily output was 21.3% higher compared to the second half of December last year. Major indicators such as timber processing also saw significant improvements, breaking the conventional pattern of timber production being slack in the first half of the month and tight in the second half.

Strengthening the Party's leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, vigorously launching mass movements, and vigorously promoting technical innovation are the main reasons for the above achievements in Heilongjiang's timber production in the first half of January. According to statistics from the first ten days of the month, forestry bureaus have implemented over 1,200 technical innovations and promoted more than 260 advanced experiences. The Dahailin Forestry Bureau's technicians and workers successfully tested the method of using tractors to pull sleds for transporting timber, increasing the daily timber transport volume from 20 cubic meters to 156 cubic meters. Workers at the Fenglin Forest Farm of the Tieli Forestry Bureau created a continuous production method, solving the problem of disjointed work processes. Now, timber production can be transported directly from the mountains to the railway station, increasing efficiency fourteen times and reducing the number of workers in the transportation link from 53 to 8, reducing costs by 17.5%.

    哈尔滨太平区全部三十七个大中型工厂
    提前半月完成全月计划
    黑龙江革新木材生产技术上半月日日超产
    据新华社哈尔滨15日电　近几天，哈尔滨市太平区各工厂锣鼓喧天，喜气洋洋，职工们纷纷向党报捷：全区所有工厂都提前全面超额完成了1月份的生产计划。其中包括哈尔滨玻璃纤维厂、聚乙烯塑料厂、松江橡胶厂、松江化学厂、哈尔滨耐火材料厂、石棉制品厂等三十七个大、中型工厂。
    1月上半月，全区各工厂生产的胶鞋、罐头、水泵、锉刀等六十多种主要产品的产量、质量以及各厂的劳动生产率，都比去年12月显著提高；各厂没有发生人身事故，还有十三种新产品投入生产。目前，全区各工厂正在继续开展技术革新和技术革命运动，在力争1月份更多超产的同时，积极准备夺取春节开门红、第一季月月红。
    太平区各工厂职工们在今年一开始上班，就干劲十足，立即开展技术革新和技术革命运动，使生产高速度地跃进。1月上半月，各厂共实现了重大革新二百九十八项，创制成功五条生产自动线，改进了六十四台旧设备，分别提高效率一倍到一百倍。
    据新华社哈尔滨15日电　黑龙江省林业部门1月上半月木材生产量日日超额完成计划，平均日产量和去年12月下半月比较超过了21．3％，木材加工等主要指标也都有很大提高，打破了历年来木材生产前半月松后半月紧的常规。
    加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新，是黑龙江1月上半月木材生产取得上述成就的主要原因。据上旬统计，各林业局共实现技术革新一千二百余件，推广先进经验二百六十多项。大海林林业局，技术人员和工人试验成功拖拉机拉爬犁运材法，使木材每日运输量由二十立方米提高到一百五十六立方米。铁力林业局丰林林场职工创造了生产连续化的方法，解决了工序互不衔接的矛盾，现在生产的木材可以由山上直接运到火车站，提高效率十四倍，并且将运材环节上的五十三名劳力减少到八名，成本下降了17．5％。
