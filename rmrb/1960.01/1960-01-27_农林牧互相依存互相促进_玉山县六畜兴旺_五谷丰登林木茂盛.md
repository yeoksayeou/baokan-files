Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry are interdependent and mutually promoting
    Yushan County has flourishing livestock, bumper grain harvests, and lush forests
    (Our report) In 1959, Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, utilized the interdependent and mutually promoting relationship between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry to promote the overall development of production.

    Bumper grain harvests are the foundation for flourishing livestock. Yushan County's great development of agriculture and forestry in 1959 provided sufficient funds and feed for the development of animal husbandry. Over the past year, various communes and production teams have used the funds from selling surplus grain to purchase thousands of draught cattle and a large number of farm implements, and have established more than 2,100 pig farms and livestock farms. At present, the county has more than 350,000 pigs, averaging one pig per mu of land; more than 800,000 chickens, ducks, and geese, an increase of 50% over 1958; and cattle and sheep have increased by 40%.

    Flourishing livestock, in turn, promoted bumper grain harvests. The rapid development of animal husbandry provided more fertilizer, funds, and power for agriculture, promoting the sustained great leap forward in agriculture. In 1959 alone, the county accumulated more than 8 million dan of fertilizer from pig raising, averaging nearly 30 dan of fertilizer applied per mu of land, which transformed more than 70,000 mu of remote and barren fields throughout the county, increasing the county's grain yield per unit area last year by 40% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and the total output increased by 20%, transforming the county from a historically grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county.

    Due to the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, the task of developing forestry has been elevated to an important position. Various communes organized members to plant trees and afforest during production gaps, and last year the county's afforestation area reached 140,000 mu. The great development of forestry not only increased the production of a large amount of timber and initially controlled soil erosion, but also opened up vast pastures for animal husbandry.

    Yushan County is a semi-mountainous and semi-hilly area with 310,000 mu of farmland and more than 1 million mu of mountain forests, providing excellent conditions for developing agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production. Although agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production here has greatly developed in the ten years since liberation, due to the certain limitations on manpower and material resources during the period of agricultural cooperatives, these favorable conditions have not been fully utilized. After communization, the Yushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party led various communes to organize technicians to conduct a comprehensive survey of the rich resources in various places, and formulated a comprehensive leap forward plan for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry based on the survey results. In the implementation of the plan, the county-level Party committees fully utilized the close relationship between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, so that the three industries were combined and mutually promoted, resulting in the full utilization of existing favorable conditions, accelerating the development of production, and achieving great achievements in the simultaneous leap forward of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry.

    In utilizing the interdependent and mutually promoting relationship between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry to jointly develop the production of the three industries, Yushan County first vigorously developed animal husbandry production centered on pig raising, increasing fertilizer, power, and funds to change the low-yield appearance of remote and barren fields and comprehensively increase grain production. Secondly, vigorously develop forestry to promote agriculture with forestry and support animal husbandry with forestry. Taking Guanxi Commune as an example, the commune is a hilly area, and soil erosion was very serious before liberation, the land was barren, and grain production was extremely low. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, through several years of construction, especially after the establishment of the commune, forestry was vigorously developed, with more than 10,000 mu of afforestation in one year, controlling soil erosion, increasing grain production by two times, and removing the label of low yield; at the same time, it provided rich feed for the development of animal husbandry, and the number of livestock such as pigs, cattle, and sheep in the commune increased by more than three times compared to before communization. Thirdly, while developing forestry and animal husbandry, agriculture was comprehensively developed with grain as the main focus, promoting animal husbandry with agriculture and promoting forestry with agriculture. Bumper grain harvests provided fine feed for animal husbandry and funds for forestry, which in turn promoted the development of forestry and animal husbandry.

    In utilizing the dialectical relationship of interdependence and mutual promotion between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry to jointly develop the production of the three industries, the Party organizations at all levels in Yushan County timely adjusted the manpower, material resources, financial resources, and leadership strength on the front lines of the various industries according to the development speed and needs of each industry, to ensure the balanced development of each industry to adapt to each other. For example, in Qunli Commune, after the great harvest of early rice and spring-harvested crops in 1959, it was proposed that the yield of late rice should increase by 10% compared to early rice, which required the commune's animal husbandry to provide more high-quality fertilizer. The commune Party committee then used the 1,000+ yuan from selling surplus early rice and the 20+ laborers drawn from agriculture to increase pig farms and develop pig raising. As a result, the entire commune quickly realized two pigs per mu of land, and pig raising accumulated 1.5 million dan of fertilizer, averaging more than 30 dan per mu of late rice field, and finally realized the plan of late rice exceeding early rice. For example, after the summer harvest last year, the number of pigs in the county soared from more than 100,000 to 220,000, requiring agriculture to supply sufficient feed. At this time, the county committee and the Party committees of various communes strengthened the leadership of pig raising production on the one hand, and on the other hand, drew more than 1,000 laborers to reclaim wasteland and sow more than 50,000 mu of high-yield feed crops, ensuring the leap forward development of animal husbandry.

    On the basis of achieving a common great harvest and great development in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, the Yushan County Committee and the Party committees of various communes recently mobilized the broad masses of cadres and commune members to summarize their experiences and formulate a plan for the continued leap forward in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry this year, deciding to comprehensively promote last year's experience, more fully utilize the interdependent and mutually promoting relationship between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, further develop the production of the three industries, and strive to increase grain production by more than 30%, double the number of pigs, and increase forestry by one time this year on the basis of last year.

    At present, the cadres and commune members throughout the county are vigorously engaged in winter production centered on water conservancy construction and pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, creating a solid foundation for realizing the great leap forward in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry this year.

    农林牧互相依存互相促进
    玉山县六畜兴旺　五谷丰登林木茂盛
    本报讯　1959年，江西玉山县运用农林牧互相依存互相促进的关系，促进生产全面发展。
    五谷丰登是六畜兴旺的基础。玉山县1959年农林业大发展，为发展畜牧业提供了充足的资金和饲料。一年来，各公社、生产队用卖余粮的资金，添置了数千条耕牛和大量的农具，兴办了二千一百多个养猪场、畜牧场。目前全县饲养猪达三十五万多头，平均每亩田有一头猪；鸡鸭鹅达八十多万只，比1958年增长50％，牛羊增长40％。
    六畜兴旺又促进了五谷丰登。牧业飞跃发展为农业提供了更多的肥料、资金和动力，促进了农业持续大跃进。全县1959年仅养猪积造的肥料就达八百多万担，平均每亩田施肥近三十担，使全县七万多亩远田、瘦田得到了改造，使全县去年粮食单位面积产量比大跃进的1958年增加了40％，总产量增加了20％，由历史上缺粮县一跃而为余粮县。
    由于农牧业的发展，发展林业的任务被提到重要的地位上来。各公社组织社员利用生产空隙时间，植树造林，去年全县造林面积达十四万亩。林业大发展，既增产了大批木材，并初步控制了水土流失，同时又为牧业开辟了广阔的放牧场。
    玉山县是半山半丘陵地区，有三十一万亩农田，一百多万亩山林，发展农林牧业生产的条件很好。解放后十年来，这里的农林牧业生产虽然有很大发展，但由于农业社期间人力、物力受到一定限制，没有充分发挥这些良好条件的作用。公社化后，中共玉山县委领导各公社组织技术人员分别对各地的丰富资源全面作了调查，根据调查结果制定了农林牧全面跃进规划，在执行规划中，全县各级党委充分运用农林牧的密切关系，使三业互相结合，互相促进，结果充分利用了已有的良好条件，加速发展生产，取得了农林牧齐跃进的巨大成绩。
    在运用农林牧互相依存、互相促进的关系，共同发展三业生产中，玉山县首先大力发展以养猪为中心的畜牧业生产，增加肥料、动力、资金，以改变远田、瘦田的低产面貌，全面提高粮食产量。其次，大力发展林业，以林促农，以林养牧。以官溪公社为例，该社是丘陵地区，解放前水土流失非常严重，土地贫瘠，粮食产量极低。解放后，在党的领导下，经过几年的建设，特别是公社成立后大力发展林业，一年造林一万多亩，控制了水土流失，使粮食产量提高了两倍，摘掉了低产帽子；同时为发展畜牧业提供了丰富的饲料，全社猪、牛、羊等牲畜比公社化前增加了三倍多。第三，在发展林牧业的同时，以粮食为主，全面发展农业，以农促牧，以农带林。粮食丰收，又为畜牧业提供了精饲料，为林业提供了资金，这又促进了林牧业的发展。
    在运用农林牧互相依存、互相促进的辩证关系，共同发展三业生产中，玉山县各级党组织根据各业发展的速度和需要，及时调整各业战线上的人力、物力、财力和领导力量，保证各业互相适应的平衡发展。例如群力公社，1959年早稻和春收作物大丰收后，提出要晚稻产量比早稻增长10％，便要公社畜牧业提供更多的优质肥料。公社党委于是利用卖早稻余粮的一千多元资金和从农业上抽出的二十多个劳动力，增办养猪场，发展养猪。结果全社生猪迅速实现了一亩田两头猪，养猪积肥达一百五十万担，平均每一亩晚稻田三十多担，终于实现了晚稻超早稻的计划。又如在去年夏收后，全县猪只由十多万头猛增到二十二万头，要求农业供应充足的饲料。这时，县委和各公社党委一面加强对养猪生产的领导，一面抽出一千多个劳力开垦荒地，播种了五万多亩高产饲料作物，保证了畜牧业的飞跃发展。
    在取得农林牧共同大丰收、大发展的基础上，玉山县委和各公社党委最近发动广大干部社员总结了经验，制定了今年农林牧结合继续跃进的规划，决定全面推行去年的经验，更加充分地运用农林牧互相依存、互相促进的关系，进一步发展三业生产，力争在去年的基础上，今年粮食产量提高30％以上，猪翻一番，林业增长一倍。
    目前，全县干部和社员们正在大搞以兴修水利、养猪积肥为中心的冬季生产，为实现今年农林牧大跃进创立雄厚的基础。
