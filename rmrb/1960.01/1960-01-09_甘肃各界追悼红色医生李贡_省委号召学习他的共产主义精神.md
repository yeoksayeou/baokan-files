Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th - A memorial service was held on the 5th in Gansu Province and Lanzhou City by people from all walks of life to solemnly mourn the red doctor Li Gong. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has posthumously recognized Li Gong as a full member of the CPC and called on the people of the province to learn from Li Gong's communist spirit.

Li Gong was 28 years old and a probationary member of the CPC. After graduating from Gansu Provincial Health School in 1954, he served as a doctor in the Taojiang County Health Center and the Oula People's Commune in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. He was also elected as a representative to the Gansu Provincial Advanced Producers Congress and a member of the Second Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Last year, after returning from the National Conference of Heroes, he participated in the Gansu Provincial Delegation to Comfort Field Workers and went to the Liujiaxia construction site to offer condolences. Unfortunately, he accidentally fell into the water and drowned on December 29th. During his five years of work in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, he demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary responsibility and selfless dedication. He once cut four pieces of skin from his own leg and used skin grafts to cure a severe burn that had plagued a Tibetan laboring woman, Cao Jia, for two years. In May last year, when spotted fever occurred on the grasslands, Li Gong, whose health had not fully recovered from typhoid fever, disregarded his weakness and treated the Tibetan people day and night. Because the pastoral area was vast and the specific medicine for treating typhoid fever could not be transported in time, he resolutely drew his own fresh blood (the blood of those who had just recovered from typhoid fever contains protective antibodies) to inject into typhoid fever patients, saving more than a dozen Tibetan patients from danger. Li Gong used his own flesh and blood to strengthen the bond between the Party and the Tibetan people. His deeds were widely circulated on the grasslands, and the Tibetan people praised Li Gong as a good "Manba" (doctor) sent by Chairman Mao.

More than 1,000 people attended the memorial service, including Gao Jianjun and He Chenghua, Secretaries of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Bingxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat and Vice Governor of Gansu Province, Wang Yaohua, Alternate Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Deng Baoshan, Governor of Gansu Province, Huang Zhengqing, Vice Governor and Governor of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Vice Governors Ma Qingnian and Huang Luobin. Gao Jianjun delivered a eulogy at the meeting, saying: Comrade Li Gong created brilliant achievements and set an immortal example in his ordinary position. Comrade Li Gong's life vividly reflects the image of a young communist fighter who grew up under the cultivation and education of the Party, and has become a red flag on the socialist construction front in Gansu. He called on the people of the province to learn from Comrade Li Gong's spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly and make greater contributions to socialist construction. Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), Vice Governor of Gansu Province and Governor of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, praised Li Gong's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the Tibetan people in his eulogy. He said: Comrade Li Gong will always live in the hearts of the Tibetan people and will always inspire the Tibetan people to move forward.

    甘肃各界追悼红色医生李贡
    省委号召学习他的共产主义精神
    新华社兰州8日电　甘肃省和兰州市各界5日举行追悼会，隆重追悼红色医生李贡。中共甘肃省委已追认李贡为中共正式党员，并号召全省人民学习李贡的共产主义精神。
    李贡，二十八岁，中共预备党员。他1954年在甘肃省卫生学校毕业后，曾先后担任甘南藏族自治州洮江县卫生所医生和洮江县欧拉人民公社医生，并被选为甘肃省先进生产者代表会议代表和政协甘肃省第二届委员会委员。去年参加全国群英会回来后，参加甘肃省慰问野外工作人员代表团赴刘家峡工地慰问时，不幸于12月29日失足落水淹死。他在甘南藏族自治州工作的五年间，表现了高度的革命责任感和舍己为人的精神。他曾经从自己腿上割下四块皮肤，用植皮手术治好了藏族劳动妇女曹加两年未愈的严重烧伤。去年5月，草原上发生斑疹伤寒，李贡当时因患伤寒身体还未完全复原，就不顾体弱，日夜为藏民治病。因为牧区辽阔，治伤寒特效药一时运不到，他就毅然抽出自己的鲜血（伤寒初愈者的血含有保护抗体），为伤寒患者注射。使十多个藏族病人脱离了险境。李贡用自己的血肉密切了党与藏族人民的联系，草原上到处传说他的事迹，藏族人民称颂李贡是“毛主席派来的好“曼巴”（医生）”。
    参加追悼的有中共甘肃省委书记处书记高健君、何承华，书记处书记、甘肃省副省长王秉祥，省委候补书记王耀华，甘肃省省长邓宝珊，副省长、甘南藏族自治州州长黄正清，副省长马青年、黄罗斌等一千多人。高健君在会上致悼词说：李贡同志在平凡的岗位上，创造了光辉的业绩，树立了不朽的典型。李贡同志的一生，生动地反映了在党的培养教育下成长起来的青年共产主义战士的形象，成为甘肃社会主义建设战线上的一面红旗。他号召全省人民学习李贡同志忠心耿耿为人民服务的精神，为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。甘肃省副省长、甘南藏族自治州州长黄正清（藏族）在致悼词中表扬了李贡全心全意为藏族人民服务的精神，他说：李贡同志将永远活在藏族人民心里，永远鼓舞着藏族人民前进。
