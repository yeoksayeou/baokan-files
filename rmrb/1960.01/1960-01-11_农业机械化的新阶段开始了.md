    A New Stage in Agricultural Mechanization Begins
    Hu Jiwei, Li Banli
    The December Plenary Session of the Korean Workers' Party designated 1960 as a buffer period for socialist construction, a turning point from one peak to another even higher peak.

    The heroic Korean people, in welcoming New Year's Day 1960, used the great achievement of exceeding the industrial gross output value plan of the First Five-Year Plan by more than 113% to complete it two years ahead of schedule. After a buffer period of one year in 1960, the even more ambitious Second Five-Year Plan will begin one year ahead of schedule in 1961.

    The buffer period is not a period of slow progress, but still a period of continued great leaps forward, only the focus of the great leap forward is different, to make the weak links in the "Chollima Movement" also leap forward at high speed and catch up with the advanced links.

    On the industrial front, the Korean people have already stepped into 1962 two and a half years ahead of schedule. Comparatively, agriculture has become the weak link in the "Chollima Movement." The Korean Workers' Party stipulates that the most important task in 1960 is to concentrate efforts on promoting agricultural mechanization.

    In fact, the development of agriculture in North Korea is also very rapid. At present, the rural areas of North Korea have basically achieved water conservancy, and 88% of agricultural cooperatives have electricity. The grain output in 1958 was equivalent to 159% of that at the time of the armistice in 1953, and the cotton output was equivalent to 282%. Look at the United States, which claims to be the world's number one power, its grain output in 1958 was only equivalent to 125% of that in 1949, and its cotton output was only equivalent to 71%. If we compare it with South Korea under the rule of American imperialism, it is even more like a military demarcation line, a stark contrast between hell and heaven. South Korea's current irrigation area is still less than 20% of the arable land area, and the arable land area has decreased by 600,000 cho (Note 1) compared with the Japanese colonial period, and the total grain output has decreased by 34%. During the Japanese colonial period, South Korea was the granary of Korea, and the grain output was twice that of North Korea, but now it is much less than North Korea. This is the result of the sinful rule of American imperialism.

    The Korean people, straddling the Chollima, are not satisfied with their current agricultural development, believing that the current agricultural development is not adapted to industrial development and is a weak link in the development of the national economy. They have even more ambitious goals for agricultural development, and that goal is agricultural mechanization.

    The Korean people have long set the great goal of agricultural mechanization, and many advanced agricultural production cooperatives have already begun to enter a new stage of agricultural mechanization, and some have already made excellent achievements. Visiting such agricultural cooperatives is truly exhilarating.

    The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingbao-ri (Note 2), Hamju County, Hamgyongnam-do is a more prominent example. This cooperative has 385 households, more than 1,700 people, and 414 cho of cultivated land. Mechanized cultivation accounts for 70% of the total cultivated land. When we came to this cooperative, we saw the vast expanse of flat fields, which opened our hearts. When we walked to the threshing ground, the electric combine harvester, two or three people tall, first attracted our attention. Bundles of rice were sent in from this side, and bags of refined and winnowed grain were sent out from the other side. This combine harvester was manufactured by the agricultural cooperative's machine repair team using scrap iron and wood. Although the wood was not planed and the machine was covered with welding scars, it was covered with a shed to prevent wind and rain. It looks unremarkable, but it can thresh 80,000 kilograms of grain every day in two shifts (800 straw bags per shift, 50 kilograms per bag). This semi-native, semi-foreign machine can save more than 13,000 workdays in threshing alone. The cooperative's pig farm is also semi-mechanized. Rows of arched pig houses are assembled with prefabricated components of weathered stone blocks, and the machine for manufacturing these prefabricated components is also self-made. The pig farm also has a forage cutter and a feed grinder. The transportation of feed and manure is done by iron-wheeled carts sliding on wooden rails. The woodworking team has an electric saw, a wooden frame combined lathe that can plane, drill, and cut, and a steam boiler and water pump to heat the wood in winter. The most exciting thing is the machine repair team. In two dilapidated small rooms, there is a blacksmith's furnace, a small lathe, an electric roller, and an electric welder. The yard is full of various scrap iron, and several people are making seeders in the yard. In 1959 alone, seven of them manufactured 54 machines of 27 types, which can save a total of more than 70,000 workdays. When they were manufacturing the combine harvester, some people ridiculed them, saying that it would not be completed in a year, but it was completed in one month. What is even more gratifying is that the nearby state-owned Ryongsong Machinery Factory gave them a new simple lathe, and they are building a new factory building for it. This machine repair team will soon develop into a small agricultural machinery repair factory.

    It is a very good system for a workshop in a state-owned machinery factory to be responsible for helping an agricultural cooperative carry out agricultural mechanization. We visited the Unsan Tool Factory, and their deeds of actively helping agricultural cooperatives are very moving. In September 1958, the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea decided that the factory should vigorously support agricultural mechanization, and the workers enthusiastically discussed what kind of machinery to produce to support the countryside. At first, many people only thought that producing tractors and automobiles could support the countryside, but this was what they could not produce. Some workers said that Premier Kim Il-sung had called for the elimination of carrying frames and head carrying, so they suggested making some small carts, but some people doubted: "Are farmers happy to have small carts? Can small carts help agricultural mechanization?" The Democratic Youth League of the Youth Workshop raised this issue to the Youth League Committee of Unsan County, and the County Youth League convened the Youth League chairmen of 29 ris to discuss the workers' issues. Everyone welcomed the small carts. The workers first made 20 carts and carried them to the Seongbong water conservancy construction site. The farmers expressed great gratitude to them. The news spread, and nearby agricultural cooperatives sent letters to the factory, welcoming their help. Each workshop in the factory convened a workers' meeting, read the farmers' letters at the meeting, and everyone enthusiastically discussed and decided that one workshop would be responsible for helping one agricultural cooperative, and the relationship between the factory and the agricultural cooperative became closer. In April 1959, more than 20 junior high school students (Young Pioneers) from Namsong Village, Cheonsu-ri, Hyangsan County, came to the factory with a duck in their arms and asked to see the electrician uncle. The workers in the Power Workshop received them. They said that their village was a very remote small mountain village. They saw that other villages had electricity, but their village did not. Not only was it inconvenient to study at night, but the threshing machine was also very slow to be pulled by livestock. They hoped that the electrician uncle would help them. The workers were very moved and agreed to the Young Pioneers' request. On May 1st, they made a small generator and sent it to Namsong Village, helping them to convert the thresher to electric power, and also helped the whole village install more than 40 electric lights and wired broadcasting. The Youth Workshop is responsible for helping the Pungyang Agricultural Cooperative in Unsan County. In the winter of 1958, they sent 30 windmills to the Pungyang Cooperative, and the farmers slaughtered two fat pigs and sent them to the factory during the New Year.

    In the past year or so, the Unsan Tool Factory has helped the rural areas with 400 small carts, 4 small generators, 50 rice transplanters, 50 disc harrows, 30 windmills, 300 deep plows, 1,019 broadcast loudspeakers, and many iron nails, hinge chains, iron wires, electric wires, etc. Except for the disc harrows, which used some good steel, the rest were made by the workers using scrap iron and waste materials in their spare time.

    The Huichon Machine Tool Factory, which is larger in scale than the Unsan Tool Factory, in addition to adopting the method of one workshop helping one agricultural cooperative, is also responsible for helping the nearby four counties establish mechanical repair and assembly plants, and supporting the rural areas through these local factories. In the past year or so, they have sent 11 lathes, 5 drilling machines, 5 planers, 4 iron smelting furnaces, and many tools such as lathe tools and pliers to these four counties, and also helped train more than 150 technicians.

    The Unsan Tool Factory and the Huichon Machine Tool Factory are both assigned to produce certain components and parts for the production of tractors. North Korea has not yet been able to completely independently produce tractors. Instead of waiting to build a new tractor factory, they are accelerating the transformation of the original Giyang Agricultural Machinery Factory to make it an all-round factory capable of independently producing tractors as soon as possible. Before the transformation is completed, they will give full play to the strength of existing machinery factories and use the method of large-scale cooperation between factories to produce tractors. Of the 4,000 tractors needed for agricultural mechanization in 1960, 3,000 were produced by themselves. This spirit of self-reliance is very valuable. The Huichon Machine Tool Factory is responsible for producing the main component of the engine—the gearbox. It was successfully trial-produced in 1959 and is now in mass production.

    After the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea convened the December Plenary Session at the end of 1959, the Conference of Advanced Workers in Agricultural Mechanization held in Pyongyang from the 17th to the 19th specifically studied the policies and guidelines for agricultural mechanization in 1960, exchanged experiences, and launched a competition. There are now more than 80 tractor service stations in North Korea, with a total of more than 7,000 tractors (converted according to the standard of 15 horsepower). With the addition of 4,000 new units in 1960, it still cannot meet the needs of agricultural mechanization. Therefore, the December Plenary Session decided to adopt a policy of focused use, and first concentrate the supply of various agricultural machinery to South Pyongan Province and South Hwanghae Province in the plains, so that these areas can basically achieve agricultural mechanization in 1961. The standard of mechanization is that 75%-80% of agricultural labor power is mechanized, and the remaining 15%-20% of labor power is animal-powered mechanized.

    On the day the Conference of Advanced Workers in Agricultural Mechanization closed, we visited the Korea-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Sunan County, South Pyongan Province. In order to welcome the high tide of agricultural mechanization in 1960, this agricultural cooperative and the tractor service station responsible for this cooperative have launched a new production competition. Seeing their enthusiasm and listening to their methods, we were very impressed by their resolute spirit of immediately implementing the Party's resolutions.

    According to the resolution of the December Plenary Session, the tractor service station has been renamed the "Agricultural Machinery Operation Station." In the past, it was only responsible for cultivating the land, but now it is responsible for the mechanization of the entire labor process from planting to harvesting. In the past, it was only responsible for cultivation and not responsible for the harvest volume, but now the tractor driver's salary is determined by the amount of harvest. In the past, the service team would till the land of one cooperative today and till the land of another cooperative tomorrow, but now it has been changed to fixed cultivation; and whichever cooperative the tractor driver is responsible for, he will move his family to that cooperative, and his wife will become a member of that cooperative. In the past, skilled tractor drivers became team leaders and did not drive tractors, but this method has now been changed.

    Comrade Kim Bong-hoon, a tractor driver, told us that their machinery operation station originally had 17 management personnel, but now it has been reduced to 6. They have already signed a contract with this cooperative. In the past, they only plowed the land and did not transport fertilizer. This year, the cooperative plans to apply 30 tons of fertilizer per cho, and they have equipped each tractor with two trailers to be responsible for transporting the fertilizer to the fields first, ensuring that the land will not be plowed if there is insufficient fertilizer, and ensuring that all deep plowing is 30 centimeters. He said that they originally had 40 tractors, and in 1960 they will increase to 100, which is really getting more and more energetic; in the past, they were only responsible for cultivation, but now they are responsible for more harvests.

    The machinery operation team of this cooperative has a total of 20 people and only some blacksmith shop tools, but they used handicraft methods to manufacture two electric combine harvesters, a crane that can lift prefabricated components weighing 500 kilograms to a height of 8 meters, a tractor trailer, and also produced 44 ox carts, 130 iron-made ox-drawn weeding machines, and more than 3,000 sickles and hoes. They also have even greater ideals: there are several students from Pyongyang Construction University who came to participate in labor in the cooperative. Through the relationship of these students, they sent scrap iron to the school and used the school's machine tools to manufacture a simple lathe for the cooperative. They sent three people there and strived to manufacture it in January 1960. They also sent two people to the Giyang Machinery Factory to learn technology. With machine tools and technicians, they plan to build a small iron smelting furnace in 1960 and produce more complex machines such as rice transplanters, forage cutters, grass rope making machines, and grass mat weaving machines. At present, each production operation team and machinery operation team adopts the method of directly signing contracts. The production team proposes what kind of machinery is needed and is responsible for supplying scrap iron; the machinery team has established an amateur machinery research team, which is responsible for researching and designing the machinery required by each production team. Zhao Yulian, a female labor model, asked, "If there is a machine for making cotton nutrient pots, can we also use a machine for planting nutrient pots?" The machinery team is studying the manufacture of this machine.

    At present, they are enthusiastically leveling the land. Their leveling steps are first plains and then mountains, first dry land and then paddy fields, first easy and then difficult. At first, the 24 agricultural operation teams leveled the land themselves, but now they have organized a temporary land leveling professional operation team. This can prevent the departmentalism of each operation team, and it is also convenient to level the land according to the needs of all cultivated land mechanization, breaking the original boundaries between teams. They are now changing roads, canals, and field ridges. Their goal is to change all the existing 2,700 small plots of land in the cooperative into 426 large plots of land by the end of 1961, opening up a smooth future for the mechanization of all cultivated land!

    农业机械化的新阶段开始了
    胡季委　李半黎
    朝鲜劳动党中央十二月全会把1960年定为社会主义建设的缓冲期，是从一个高峰转移到另一个更高的高峰的转折时期。
    英雄的朝鲜人民在迎接1960年元旦时，用113％以上的伟大成绩提前两年超额完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划。经过1960年一年的缓冲期，到1961年就提前一年开始更为宏伟的第二个五年计划。
    缓冲期并不是缓进时期，仍然是继续跃进的时期，只是跃进的重点不同，是使“千里马运动”中的薄弱环节也高速度地跃进起来，赶上先进的环节。
    在工业战线上，朝鲜人民已经提前两年半跨进了1962年。比较起来，农业就成为“千里马运动”中的薄弱环节。朝鲜劳动党规定，1960年最主要的任务，是集中力量促进农业机械化。
    其实，朝鲜的农业发展也是很快的，现在，朝鲜的农村已经基本上实现水利化了，88％的农业社有了电。1958年的谷物产量相当于1953年停战时的159％，棉花产量相当于282％。看一看那个自称世界第一强国的美国吧，1958年的粮食产量只相当于1949年的125％，棉花产量只相当于71％。如果拿美帝国主义统治下的南朝鲜来比，更是一条军事分界线，严然地狱比天堂。南朝鲜现在灌溉面积还达不到耕地面积的20％，耕地面积比日本统治时期减少了六十万町步（注一），谷物总产量减少了34％。在日本统治时期，南朝鲜是朝鲜的粮仓，谷物产量等于北朝鲜的两倍，但是现在，却比北朝鲜少得多，这就是美帝国主义罪恶统治的结果。
    跨上千里马的朝鲜人民，并不满足于他们目前农业发展的情况，认为目前的农业发展和工业发展不相适应，是国民经济发展中的薄弱环节，他们对农业发展有着更为远大的目标，这个目标是农业机械化。
    朝鲜人民早就定下了农业机械化的伟大目标，不少先进的农业生产合作社，已经早就开始进入农业机械化的新阶段，有的已经做出了很优越的成绩。到这样的农业社去参观，真是叫人心花怒放。
    咸镜南道咸州郡兴堡里（注二）的红星农业生产合作社就是一个比较突出的典型。这个社有三百八十五户、一千七百多人口和四百一十四町步耕地。机耕面积占总耕地面积的70％。我们来到这个社，看见那里平坦的田地一望无际，心胸豁然开朗。走到打谷场上，两三人高的电动联合脱谷机首先吸引住我们。一捆捆稻谷从这边送进去，一袋袋经过精选扬净的谷子就从那边送出来。这个联合脱谷机是农业社机修小组用废铁和木头自己制造的，虽然木头未刨光，机器到处是焊接的疤痕，为了防风雨还给它盖了一个草棚，看起来貌不惊人，但是，它每天两班能脱谷八万公斤（每班八百草袋，每袋五十公斤），这个半土半洋的机器，仅脱谷一项就能节省一万三千多个劳动日。社里的养猪场也是半机械化的，一排一排的圆拱式的猪舍，是用风化石大砌块的预制构件装配起来的，而这个制造预制构件的机器也是自己制造的。养猪场还有铡草机和饲料粉碎机，运饲料和出粪都是铁轮车在木轨上滑行。木工作业组有电锯，有能刨能钻能切削的木架联合车床，有冬季作业把木料加热的蒸气锅炉和抽水泵。最使人兴奋的是机械修理小组，两间破旧的小房，里面有铁匠炉，有小车床，有电滚，有电焊，院子里堆满了各种废铁，几个人正在院子里制造播种机。1959年一年，他们七个人制造了二十七种机器共计五十四台，一共可以节约七万多个劳动日。他们在制造联合脱谷机时，曾有人嘲笑他们，说一年也造不成，但是，一个月就做好了。更可喜的是附近的国营龙城机械厂送给他们一部新的简易车床，他们正在为它修一间新厂房。这个机修小组很快就会发展成为一个小型农业机修厂。
    国营机械工厂一个车间负责帮助一个农业社进行农业机械化，这是工业支援农业的一个很好的制度。我们访问过云山工具厂，他们积极帮助农业社的事迹是十分动人的。1958年9月，劳动党中央决定工厂大力支援农业机械化，工人们就热烈讨论生产什么机械去支援农村。开初，很多人只想到生产拖拉机和汽车才能支援农村，而这又是他们不能生产的。有的工人说，金日成首相曾号召消灭背架和头顶，因此提议造一些小推车，但是有人怀疑：“农民高兴要小推车吗？小推车能帮助农业机械化吗？”青年车间的民主青年同盟就把这个问题提给云山郡的民青委员会，郡民青召集二十九个里的民青委员长来讨论工人们的问题，大家都很欢迎小推车。工人们就先造了二十辆，自己抬着送到城峰水利工地去，农民们对他们表示很大的感谢。消息传开了，附近农业社都给工厂去信，欢迎他们的帮助。工厂的每一个车间都召集工人大会，在会上读农民的信，大家热烈讨论，决定一个车间负责帮助一个农业社，工厂和农业社的关系就变得更加亲密了。1959年4月，香山郡川水里南松村的二十几个初中学生（少先队员），一人抱一只鸭子到工厂要求见电工叔叔，动力车间的工人接见了他们。他们说他们村是一个很偏僻的小山村，看见人家村里都有电，他们村没有，不只晚上学习不方便，打谷机用牲口拉也很慢，希望电工叔叔帮助他们。工人们很感动，答应了少先队员们的要求，5月1日就造了一部小发电机给南松村送去，帮助他们把脱谷机改为电动，而且还帮助全村安上了四十多盏电灯和有线广播。青年车间负责帮助云山郡的丰阳农业合作社，1958年冬天，他们给丰阳社送去了风车三十台，在过年时农民们就杀了两头肥猪送给工厂。
    一年多来，云山工具厂一共帮助农村小推车四百部，小型发电机四台，插秧机五十部，圆盘耙五十架，风车三十架，深耕犁三百部，广播喇叭一千零十九个，还有很多铁钉、活页铙链、铁丝、电线等等，除了圆盘耙用了一些好钢以外，其他都是工人们利用废铁废料在工余时间制造出来的。
    规模比云山工具厂大的熙川机床厂，除了采取一个车间帮助一个农业社的办法以外，还负责帮助附近四个郡建立了机械修配厂，通过这些地方工厂来支援农村。一年多来，他们送给这四个郡十一台车床，五台钻床，五台刨床，四座熔铁炉和车刀、钳子等很多工具，还帮助培养了一百五十多名技术工人。
    云山工具厂和熙川机床厂都为生产拖拉机分工生产一定的部件和零件。朝鲜现在还没有能够完全独立生产拖拉机的工厂，他们不是等待修建新拖拉机厂，而是一方面加快改造原有的歧阳农业机械厂，使它早日成为能够独立生产拖拉机的全能厂；一方面在改造完成以前充分发挥现有各机械厂的力量，用各厂大协作的办法来生产拖拉机。1960年满足农业机械化需要的四千台拖拉机，三千台都是自己生产。这种自力更生的精神是十分可贵的。熙川机床厂负责生产发动机的主要部件——变速箱，1959年试制成功了，现在已经大批投入生产。
    劳动党中央在1959年底召开十二月全会以后，从17日到19日在平壤召开的农业机械化先进工作者大会，具体研究了1960年农业机械化的方针政策，交流了经验，发起了竞赛。现在朝鲜有八十多个拖拉机代耕站，共有七千多台拖拉机（按十五马力标准台换算），1960年新增加四千台，仍然远远不能满足农业机械化的需要，所以十二月全会决定采取重点使用的政策，先把各种农业机械集中供应给平原地区的平安南道和黄海南道，使这些地区在1961年基本实现农业机械化。机械化的标准是75％—80％的农业劳动动力机械化，其余15％—20％的劳动畜力机械化。
    就在农业机械化先进工作者大会闭幕那天，我们访问了平安南道顺安郡的朝中友谊农业社。为了迎接1960年农业机械化的高潮，这个农业社和负责这个社的拖拉机代耕站已经展开了新的生产竞赛。看一看他们的干劲，听一听他们的办法，那种立即贯彻党的决议的坚决精神，使我们十分佩服。
    根据十二月全会的决议，拖拉机代耕站已经改为“农业机械作业所”，过去只负责耕地，以后要负责从种到收的整个劳动过程的机械化。过去只负责耕，不负责庄稼的收获量，现在按收获量的多少确定拖拉机手工资的高低。过去代耕作业班今天翻这个社的地，明天翻那个社的地，现在改为固定耕种；而且拖拉机手负责哪一个社就把家搬到哪一个社，妻子就当哪一个社的社员。过去熟练的拖拉机手当了班长就不驾驶拖拉机，现在也改变了这个办法。
    拖拉机手金凤勋同志对我们说，他们那个机械作业所原来有十七个管理人员，现在缩减到六人。他们已经和这个社定了包干合同，过去只翻地不运肥，今年社里一町步计划施肥三十吨，他们已经为每台拖拉机配了两台拖车，负责先把肥运到地里，保证肥料不足不翻地，保证一律深耕三十厘米。他说，他们原来有四十台拖拉机，1960年要增加到一百台，真是越干越有劲；过去只负责耕，现在要负责多收。
    这个社的机械作业班一共二十个人，只有一些铁匠铺的工具，但是他们用手工业的方法制造了两台电动联合脱谷机，造了一台能使五百公斤重的预制构件吊到八米高的起重机，造了一辆拖拉机用的拖车，还生产了四十四辆牛车、一百三十部铁制的牛拉锄草机和三千多把镰刀和锄头。他们还有更远大的理想：社里有几个来参加劳动的平壤建设大学的学生，他们通过这些学生的关系，把废铁送去，利用学校的机床为社里制造一台简易车床，他们派了三个人去，争取在1960年1月就制造好。他们还派了两个人到歧阳机械厂去学习技术。有了机床有了技工，他们1960年计划要修建一个小熔铁炉，要生产像插秧机、铡草机、打草绳机、编草席机等等比较复杂的机械。现在，各个生产作业班和机械作业班采用直接订合同的办法，生产班提出需要什么机械，并负责供给废铁；机械班成立了一个业余机械研究小组，负责研究和设计各生产班要求生产的机械。妇女劳动模范赵玉莲提出，作棉花的营养钵有了机器，栽营养钵能不能也用机器？机械班正在研究制造这种机器。
    目前，他们正在热火朝天地平整土地，他们平整的步骤是先平原后山地，先旱田后水田，先易后难。开初是由二十四个农业作业班自己平整，现在组织了一个临时的整地专业作业班，这样就可以防止各作业班的本位主义，而且便于根据全部耕作机械化的需要来平整土地，打破了原有班与班的界限。他们现在正在改道路、改渠道、改田坎。他们的奋斗目标是要在1961年年底把全社现有的二千七百多块小块土地改为四百二十六块大块土地，为全部耕作机械化开辟平坦的前程！
