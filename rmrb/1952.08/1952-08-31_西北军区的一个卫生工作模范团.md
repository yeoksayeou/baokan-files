    A Sanitary Work Model Regiment of the Northwest Military Region
    Xiè Shìliáng
    In late June, we went to the station of a certain automobile regiment of the Northwest Military Region to inspect sanitation work. This regiment was one of the best units we found in our inspection of the patriotic sanitation movement in various parts of the Northwest. Inside and outside the courtyards of all departments of the regiment, not a single piece of garbage or sewage could be found. The courtyards were covered with a layer of clean sand. The beds and bedding in the dormitories were very neat and clean. Dust could not be seen or touched anywhere on the walls. The toilets had fly-prevention equipment, were free of flies and maggots, and did not smell much. The kitchen hygiene of all units in the regiment was particularly good. In the dormitories of the cooks in several units, the bedding and sheets were so white and clean that they looked like those in hospital wards. The personal hygiene of the soldiers was also very good. When we arrived, they were holding a regiment-wide military meeting. We randomly selected a squad for inspection, and among the dozen or so people, only one person's shirt collar was relatively dirty; otherwise, there were no obvious shortcomings.

    The soldiers were all in good health. Regiment Commander Lǐ Déqiáng told us that the most significant achievement since the regiment launched a mass sanitation campaign has been a significant reduction in the incidence of disease. Now, only four or five soldiers with minor illnesses regularly visit the health team's clinic. The overall health level of officers and soldiers has improved, and everyone is in high spirits, working and studying happily, and successfully completing every task. The health team is no longer busy with treatment work and can devote sufficient resources to sanitation work.

    The environmental sanitation of the regiment's station was originally very poor. The station was originally the cavalry barracks of the Mǎ Bùfāng bandit gang. Many of the barracks were originally "horse stables." Manure was piled up all around. Inside the houses and courtyards, there was a thick layer of horse manure and grass clippings. The walls of the houses, inside and out, were also covered with a layer of horse manure dust. The kitchens and toilets were even more unimaginably dirty.

    More than two years ago, after a certain regiment moved in here, it spent a great deal of effort to remove the horse manure and clean up the houses and courtyards. However, at that time, due to limitations in material conditions and the fact that the majority of the regiment was made up of new soldiers with a low level of health education, the cleaning and sanitation work was not done thoroughly. At that time, the incidence of disease among the soldiers was relatively high. Because of the large number of sick soldiers in each unit, it often hindered the completion of work tasks.

    However, the soldiers, like annihilating the enemy on the battlefield, were determined to change this unsanitary environment with their own hands. In this movement, the cooks of the Third Company took the lead. The comrades of the cook squad, seeing that there were many sick soldiers in the company, first thought that this was closely related to their work, so they decided to find ways to improve kitchen hygiene. Initially, they worked hard to clean and tidy up the kitchen and paid attention to hygiene in their work. However, everyone felt that to further improve sanitation work, it was necessary to renovate the kitchen building and add some necessary equipment. This required a considerable amount of funds, but they decided not to ask the company headquarters for it, but to find ways to do it themselves. All the comrades in the cook squad made adobe bricks in their spare time every day and sold them to construction departments. They sold a total of more than 400,000 yuan. They used this money, along with their own labor, to build a clean and sanitary kitchen.

    They leveled the ground inside and outside the kitchen, moved the stove opening outside the wall, and built a small room to protect the fire watchers from wind and rain. Chimneys were built on the stoves, and the stove platforms were plastered to a smooth, shiny finish. Skylights were built on the roof, and the walls were plastered white, with white paper pasted on the ceiling. They made multi-compartment kitchen cabinets and shelves for kitchen utensils, and the pots, jars, bowls, and plates were neatly arranged in an orderly manner, with fly-prevention equipment added. The cooks wore masks and clean white aprons while working. The atmosphere in the kitchen was completely new.

    All the officers and soldiers of the company were encouraged by the achievements of the cook squad. Under the leadership of the company leaders, a wave of enthusiasm for doing sanitation work was set off throughout the company. They thoroughly cleaned the inside and outside of the courtyard, filling it with clean sand. New toilets were also built. Specific regulations were also made for the internal affairs of the dormitory and personal hygiene. The sanitation situation of the entire company changed. After that, the number of sick soldiers in the Third Company decreased significantly, and work efficiency also improved.

    In the winter of 1950, the achievements of the Third Company in starting sanitation work were valued by the regimental headquarters. The regimental leaders rewarded the cook squad of the Third Company and awarded them a red flag for sanitation models. They also summarized the experience of the Third Company in sanitation work and called on the entire regiment to learn from the Third Company and follow the example of the Third Company. Later, all units of the regiment visited the Third Company one after another and launched a competition. Sanitation work in the entire regiment was universally carried out, and each unit improved step by step in the competition. And it has always been maintained regularly.

    We asked the regimental leaders to introduce some of their experiences in doing sanitation work well. Regiment Commander Lǐ said: "Doing sanitation work well does not depend on spending a lot of money. The main thing is that the leadership must attach importance to it, mobilize the masses, and give full play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses." Indeed, the leading cadres of this regiment attach great importance to sanitation work. After discovering the typical example of the Third Company, they promptly promoted the experience of the Third Company. The regimental commander personally assigned sanitation work to each company and made strict demands. Whenever a company had sick soldiers, they always asked for a clear explanation. Regiment Commander Lǐ also had his own so-called three diligences: diligent legs (go to various units for inspection more often), diligent eyes (look at every corner), and diligent mouth (give more praise and criticism for advantages and disadvantages). In terms of mobilizing the masses, they first attached importance to health education. The regimental leaders also personally attended the health class every Friday, which promoted everyone to pay attention to learning health knowledge. Because there are two doctors in the health team who specialize in sanitation work, the policy of prevention first has been implemented. In addition, they organize various units to visit and learn from each other, which is also an effective way to promote sanitation work.

    西北军区的一个卫生工作模范团
    谢世良
    六月下旬，我们到西北军区汽车某团驻地去检查卫生工作。这个团是我们在检查西北各地爱国卫生运动中发现的成绩最好的单位之一。全团各部门的院内、院外都找不到一点垃圾和污水。院内都铺着一层干净的砂。宿舍的床铺被褥都十分整齐干净。墙壁各处看不见也摸不到灰尘。厕所里有防蝇设备，无蝇无蛆，也闻不到多大臭气。全团各单位的厨房卫生更是突出地好。有几个单位的炊事员宿舍里，被褥床单是那样洁白干净，就像是大医院里的病房里的一样。战士们的个人卫生也做得很好。我们去时，他们正在开全团军人大会。我们随便指定一个班出来检查，十几个人当中，除一个人的衬衣领子较脏外，其余都看不到什么缺点。
    战士们的身体都很健康。李德强团长告诉我们，自从全团开展群众性的卫生工作以后，最显著的成绩就是发病率大大减少。现在全团常到卫生队门诊的不过四、五个轻病号。指战员们健康水平普遍提高了，大家情绪饱满，愉快地进行着工作和学习，顺利地完成了每一项工作任务。卫生队再也不忙于治疗工作了，能够抽出充分的力量来作卫生工作。
    这个团驻地的环境卫生情况本来是很恶劣的。驻地原来是马步芳匪帮的骑兵兵营。许多兵舍原来是“马棚”。四周堆积着马粪。屋内、院内积着厚厚的一层马粪和草渣。房子的墙壁内外，也粘积着一层马粪尘土。厨房和厕所，更是脏得不堪设想。
    两年多以前，某团进驻这里之后，曾经花了很大力量来清除马粪，收拾房屋院落。可是，当时一方面受物质条件的限制，另方面又因为全团是新战士占多数，卫生教育水平还不很高，所以清洁卫生工作还做得不彻底。那时，战士们的疾病发生率是比较高的。各单位因为病号多，时常妨碍工作任务的完成。
    但是，战士们就像在战场上歼灭敌人一样，下决心要用自己的双手来改变这个不卫生的环境。在这个运动里，三连的炊事班做了开路先锋。炊事班的同志看到连队的病号多，他们首先想到这和自己的工作有密切关系，于是他们决定要设法改善厨房卫生。最初，他们努力做了许多清扫和整理厨房的工作，并且在自己的工作中间注意卫生。但大家觉得要进一步把卫生工作做好，还需要把厨房的建筑加以改造，并增添一些必要的设备。这就需要相当的一笔经费，但他们决定不向连部领，而自己动手想办法。全炊事班同志每天在业余时间打土砖，卖给建设部门。一共卖了四十多万元。他们拿这笔钱加上自己的劳动，建设了一个清洁卫生的厨房。
    他们把厨房内外填平，把灶门改在壁外，并修了一个小屋，使看火人不受风雨日晒。灶上修了烟筒，灶台粉刷得光滑发亮。屋顶上修了天窗，墙壁都粉刷得洁白，房顶上用白色麻纸糊了天棚。他们做了多格的厨柜和放厨具的架子，盆罐碗盏都有秩序地放得整整齐齐，并加了防蝇设备。案板上罩着白布，水缸、污水桶都做了盖。炊事员在工作的时候，都戴着口罩，系着洁白的围裙。厨房的气象焕然一新。
    全连指战员看到炊事班的成绩，都振奋起来了。在连首长的领导下，全连掀起了做好卫生工作的热潮。他们彻底清扫了院内院外，填上干净的砂土。又修建了新厕所。宿舍的内务和个人卫生也作了具体规定。全连的卫生状况改变了。这以后，三连的病号就显著减少，工作效率也提高了。
    一九五○年冬天，三连开始卫生工作的成绩受到了团部的重视。团首长奖励了三连的炊事班，并授给卫生模范红旗。他们并总结了三连卫生工作的经验，号召全团向三连学习，向三连看齐。以后，全团各单位先后到三连去参观，并且展开了竞赛。全团的卫生工作普遍开展起来了，各单位在竞赛中步步提高。而且一直保持了经常性。
    我们请团领导同志介绍一些他们做好卫生工作的经验。李团长说：“做好卫生工作并不在多花钱，主要是要领导方面重视，发动群众，发挥群众的创造性和积极性。”的确，这个团的领导干部对卫生工作是很重视的。他们发现三连的典型以后，及时地推广了三连的经验。团长亲自给各连布置卫生工作，要求很严格。每当连队发生了病号，总要问个明白。李团长还有他自己所说的三勤：腿勤（多到各单位去检查）、眼勤（各个角落都去看看）、嘴勤（对优缺点多加表扬与批评）。在发动群众方面，他们首先重视卫生教育。每星期五的卫生课，团首长也亲自去听，因此推动大家都注意学习卫生知识。因卫生队有两个医生专门做卫生工作，贯彻了预防为主的方针。另外，他们组织各单位互相参观和互相学习，这也是推动卫生工作的有效办法。
