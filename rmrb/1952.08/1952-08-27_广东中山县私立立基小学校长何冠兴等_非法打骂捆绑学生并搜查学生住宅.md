To the Editor:

We are reporting to you an intolerable incident. He Guanxing, the principal of Private Liji Primary School in Xiaohang Town, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, and others violated laws and discipline by beating and scolding and tying up student He Chongrui, threatening him to confess to theft, and illegally searching his home. This issue has not been reasonably resolved for a long time. Now we are telling you the facts of the matter, and we ask for your assistance in resolving it.

Last December, He Chongrui (13 years old), a second-grade student at Liji Primary School, and two other students were playing at the Shengping Theater next to the school. A large iron lock, six or seven inches long, belonging to the theater went missing, and it was suspected that it had been taken by the students, so the school was asked to investigate. When Principal He Guanxing and others interrogated them, the other two students said they saw He Chongrui's pockets bulging. He Guanxing then slapped He Chongrui, tied him up, and threatened him, saying, "I already know you sold the lock. If you don't admit it, I'll send you to the government." He Chongrui was forced to say that he sold the lock for 180,000 yuan. He Guanxing and others said it couldn't be sold for that much money. He Chongrui then said he sold it for 90,000 yuan and that the money was in the drawer of his desk at home. He Guanxing and others then took people to He Chongrui's home to search, but they found nothing. He Chongrui's father suggested that He Guanxing go back to the theater to investigate further. After a long time, He Guanxing said, "There's no problem with this matter!"

After this ordeal, He Chongrui lay in bed for several days, losing his appetite and appearing dazed. Afterwards, he never dared to go to school again.

After we learned about this during the winter vacation last year, we asked the Xiaohang Town Teachers' Union to handle it. Because He Guanxing resisted criticism and the Teachers' Union did not attach enough importance to it, the issue was delayed. It wasn't until June of this year, when the Nanfang Daily exposed a similar incident, that we raised the issue again with the Teachers' Union. The Teachers' Union still did not pay attention to the matter. After we urged them several times, He Tingsui, the chairman of the Teachers' Union, and others said, "When we went to understand the issue, He Guanxing said he was not wrong, and even scolded us and threatened to commit suicide. If we criticize him too harshly, we can't be responsible if something happens." We believe it is wrong to adopt a conciliatory attitude towards illegal behavior, so we reported the issue to Zhang Xiong, the cultural and educational cadre of the town people's government. He actually said, "The Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements have just passed, why bring up this old matter!" We had no choice but to report it to Liu Changan, the cultural and educational cadre of the district people's government, on June 30. Comrade Liu Changan believes that this issue deserves attention and accepted our opinion.

We believe that the behavior of He Guanxing and others in physically punishing students and violating human rights is a serious violation of the New Democratic education policy and the laws and decrees of the People's Government and should be dealt with seriously. This situation may also exist in other places, and we hope you will publish it to raise everyone's vigilance.

    广东中山县私立立基小学校长何冠兴等
    非法打骂捆绑学生并搜查学生住宅
    编辑同志：我们向你们揭发一件令人不能容忍的事情。广东省中山县小杭镇私立立基小学校长何冠兴等违法乱纪，打骂捆绑学生何崇锐，威胁他承认偷窃罪行，并非法搜查了他的家。这个问题长期没有得到合理解决。现在我们把事实经过告诉你们，请协助解决。
    去年十二月，立基小学二年级学生何崇锐（十三岁）等三人在学校右邻升平戏院玩。该院一个六、七寸长的大铁锁找不到了，怀疑是被学生拿走，就请学校代为查问。该校校长何冠兴等查问时，其他两个学生说是看到何崇锐的口袋鼓鼓的。何冠兴就打了何崇锐一巴掌，把他捆起来，并威胁他说：“我已知道你把锁卖了。你不承认，就送你去政府。”何崇锐被逼说是把锁卖了十八万元。何冠兴等说是卖不到这么多钱。何崇锐又说卖了九万元，并说钱放在家中书桌抽屉内。何冠兴等就带人到何崇锐家搜查，结果什么也查不到。何崇锐的父亲建议何冠兴再到戏院了解一下。隔了好久，何冠兴说：“这件事没有什么问题了！”
    何崇锐经过这次摧残后，躺在床上好几天，不思茶饭，神志恍惚。以后，他再也不敢上学了。
    我们在去年寒假中知道这件事以后，就提请小杭镇教职员联合会处理。因为何冠兴抗拒批评，教职员联合会重视不够，问题一直拖了下来。直到今年六月，南方日报揭露了类似事件，我们就再度向教职员联合会提出这个问题。教职员联合会仍不重视这件事。经我们催促好几次，教职员联合会主席何廷燧等说：“我们去了解这个问题时，何冠兴说他没有错误，反骂我们，还要寻死。如果批评他太尖锐了，出了事我们负不起责任。”我们认为对违法行为采取迁就态度是错误的，所以我们把这个问题向镇人民政府文教干部张雄反映。他竟说：“三反五反运动才过去，这件旧事重提干什么！”我们没法，就在六月三十日又向区人民政府文教干部刘长安反映。刘长安同志认为这个问题值得重视，接受了我们的意见。
    我们认为，何冠兴等体罚学生、侵犯人权的行为，严重地违反了新民主主义的教育政策和人民政府的法令，应该受到严肃的处理。这种情况，可能在其他地方也有，希望你们发表，以引起大家警惕。
