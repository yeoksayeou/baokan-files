The Japanese People Demand the Dissolution of the Diet and Early Elections

Recently, the voices of the Japanese people demanding the overthrow of the reactionary Yoshida government have become increasingly louder. Although the current members of the House of Representatives are scheduled to serve until January of next year, various opposition parties have proposed dissolving the Diet and holding early elections. This situation has been caused by the increasingly blatant implementation of traitorous policies by the current ruling party of Japan—the Liberal Party. Since the Liberal Party came to power four years ago, it has proven itself to be executing reactionary and traitorous policies, acting as a completely obedient lackey of the American occupiers. Since September of last year, the Yoshida government has signed a series of illegal separate "peace treaties," the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," "Administrative Agreement," and military base agreements, all of which have ceded sovereign rights, humiliated the nation, and harmed the people. At the same time, under the direction of the United States, it has formulated a series of fascist laws, such as the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill." The Japanese Diet, manipulated by the Liberal Party, has become a tool for the United States to implement its occupation system in Japan. This has fully exposed the reactionary nature of the Yoshida Liberal Party to the Japanese people and has been rejected and opposed by the vast majority of the population.

As early as January of this year, the Japanese Communist Party put forward an anti-imperialist, patriotic, and unified election program, and issued the call to "Overthrow the traitorous Liberal Party government" and "Establish a national liberation coalition government." Since April, the five nationwide strikes and the great "May Day" struggle held by the Japanese working people have dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary Yoshida government and have brought profound changes to the Japanese political situation. In late June, the left-wing of the Socialist Party held an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee to discuss the election issue. The left-wing of the Socialist Party believes that "The Yoshida Cabinet has committed the same crimes as Class A war criminals. The reason is that it ignores the constitution, destroys democracy, and forcibly reorganizes the military." The election program recently formulated by the right-wing of the Socialist Party also proposes "Opposing military rearmament and opposing the revision of the constitution." Even within the Liberal Party, some people, in view of the Japanese people's extreme hatred of the Yoshida government's traitorous policies and the serious crisis in which the Yoshida Cabinet is mired, have also said: "I frankly admit that the Liberal Party is facing its doomsday today. The people's criticism will be fully expressed in the next election."

However, the reactionary Yoshida clique is still attempting to maintain its rule in the next election, and it is currently making various arrangements to control the election. These arrangements mainly involve amending the current election law. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the purpose of amending the election law is to "largely restrict election campaigns," and its main points include: shortening the duration of election campaigns; completely prohibiting door-to-door visits; prohibiting the posting of campaign posters; restricting street speeches, personal lecture meetings, and newspaper and magazine reports and commentaries; increasing the election deposit by more than two times; and prohibiting the election activities of small parties that do not nominate at least twenty-five candidates. Many Liberal Party members are also engaged in shameless activities and deceptive propaganda. Last month, Liberal Party Agriculture and Forestry Minister Hirokawa Kozen announced the so-called "free rice sales policy" in an attempt to win over and deceive farmers. The "Asahi Shimbun" also said: "That is nothing more than the Liberal Party's painful struggle as an election measure."

The Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper, the "Akahata," recently called on the Japanese working class to strengthen the election struggle and exposed the Liberal Party's conspiracy activities. The Japanese people will surely unite around the national liberation democratic united front, and fight to overthrow the traitorous Yoshida government, establish a democratic coalition government, and abolish the American occupation system.

The U.S. Side Continues to Delay Korean Armistice Negotiations

The administrative meetings of the delegations from both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations, which began on July 4, were met with delaying and deceptive tactics from the US side. Our side announced on July 25 that public negotiations would resume. However, the US side continued to adopt an attitude of refusing to meet and refusing to negotiate after entering public negotiations. On the first day of the public meeting on the 26th, the US chief representative, Harrison, unilaterally decided to adjourn the meeting for seven days and fled the venue midway. When the delegation meeting resumed on August 3, Harrison insisted on adjourning the meeting for another seven days. When the delegation meeting resumed on August 11, Harrison again suggested adjourning the meeting until August 17. This tyrannical behavior by the U.S. side has continued to seriously hinder the Korean armistice negotiations.

The records of the eighteen meetings of the administrative meeting expose the hypocritical face of the U.S. representative, who talked volubly about "sincerity". Harrison stated at the delegation meeting on July 1 that the U.S. side was willing to seek "a solution that reasonably meets the requirements of both parties" on the only remaining prisoner-of-war repatriation issue in the armistice negotiations, and proposed using Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement on the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war held by both sides as the basis for resolving the prisoner issue. However, at the administrative meeting, Harrison unreasonably said: "If an armistice can be reached, it must completely preserve the position of the United Nations forces on the principle of non-forcible repatriation of prisoners of war." This means that the U.S. side still insists on its absurd claim of so-called "voluntary repatriation." In fact, the only issue currently hindering the conclusion of an agreement on the armistice negotiations, the prisoner repatriation issue, is how to correct the list of all prisoners of war to be repatriated based on the principles of Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement that both parties have agreed to. At the administrative meeting, our representative believed that as long as the list re-corrected by the U.S. side is a practical figure that has been acknowledged by the U.S. side as close to 116,000 people, and includes 20,000 captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteers, the prisoner repatriation issue can be resolved. However, at the administrative meeting on July 13, Harrison overturned the promise he made on July 1 and proposed an unreasonable plan to only repatriate 83,000 captured personnel from our side. According to this plan, 20 percent of the captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and 68 percent of the captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteers would be forcibly detained by the U.S. side. Although the U.S. side's plan slightly increased the number of prisoners to be repatriated compared to before, it still did not abandon its despicable goal of forcibly detaining captured personnel from our side. The deceptive tactics Harrison played during the administrative meeting proved that his statement on July 1 that he was "sincerely seeking an armistice to end the bloodshed in Korea" was nothing more than a shameful lie. In fact, the American aggressors want to use the secret nature of the administrative meeting as a cover to continue to obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations in order to prolong the bloodshed in Korea.

Outside the meeting, the American aggressors continue to exert so-called "military pressure" on the Chinese and Korean people. During the administrative meeting and the adjournment of the public meeting, American planes carried out a series of indiscriminate bombings of peaceful facilities and peaceful cities in Korea, and continuously violated our Northeast, massacring peace-loving residents of Korea and China on a large scale. Recently, the American aggressors even frantically planned to bomb seventy-eight cities in northern Korea. American murderers also continue to kill and wound 40 to 50 captured personnel from our side in prisoner-of-war camps such as Geoje Island, Jeju Island, and Nonsan. It is very clear that the purpose of the American aggressors is to use intimidation tactics such as bombing and massacres to force our side to accept its absurd claim of so-called "voluntary repatriation," which is to forcibly detain captured personnel from our side, otherwise, it will delay or even sabotage the armistice negotiations.

Our side has always maintained that the issue of repatriating prisoners of war should be reasonably resolved in accordance with the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War and the principles of Articles 51 and 52 of the draft Korean armistice agreement. In order to promote the early realization of the Korean armistice, our side has made all possible concessions on this issue. The American aggressors have taken advantage of our side's determination and sincerity to promote the early realization of the Korean armistice to carry out a conspiracy to detain captured personnel from our side. According to an article in the New York "Compass" on July 27, "Washington feels that North Korea and China are so determined to reach an armistice that they can be made to pay a high price." However, the American aggressors' conspiracy to extort our side by playing deceptive and intimidating tactics has gone bankrupt. Our side proposed on July 25 to end the administrative meeting, which had become ineffective due to the U.S. side's refusal to discuss, exposing the U.S. side's conspiracy to forcibly detain captured personnel from our side once again to the world and receiving righteous condemnation from the people of the world. Therefore, Harrison has adopted more and longer periods of absenteeism to carry out a conspiracy to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations.

The current characteristic of the Korean armistice negotiations is that the American aggressors continue to refuse to discuss, refuse to meet, and use the unreasonable means of interrupting meetings to push the negotiations further toward failure, conspiring to continue to expand the Korean War. Lieutenant General Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, openly stated on July 3 that "the possibility of an armistice is now smaller than at any time before" (Reuters). From this, people can see that the American aggressors are currently doing their utmost to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations, obviously harboring the evil intention of continuing to take military risks in Korea.

The Gains of the International Olympic Games

The 15th International Olympic Games were held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, from July 19 to August 3. Athletes from 70 countries with different social systems participated in this Games, which lasted for 16 days. This has played a great role in promoting the peaceful friendship between the people of all countries and strengthening the exchange of sports activities between countries.

Some countries, harboring ulterior political motives, attempted to control the International Olympic Committee and refused to allow our country to participate in this Games. The All-China Sports Federation lodged a serious protest against the International Olympic Committee's unreasonable measure that violated the Olympic Charter. People of all countries also expressed deep dissatisfaction with the International Olympic Committee's exclusion of our country. This forced the committee to finally decide to invite our country to participate in this Games. Our sports delegation departed from Beijing on July 25 and arrived in Helsinki on July 29. Due to the above-mentioned unreasonable obstruction and late issuance of the invitation, our athletes were unable to participate in the competition of other events except swimming when they arrived in Helsinki. However, as Rong Gaotang, head of our delegation, said after arriving in Helsinki: "Although we are late, we have finally arrived." This fact has fully demonstrated that the plan of some countries to conspire to prevent our country from participating in the Games has failed.

However, this did not make some countries that are hostile to our country reconciled. The International Olympic Committee, the International Amateur Basketball Federation, and the International Amateur Athletic Federation still adopted reservations, delays, and other unreasonable treatments for the legitimate status of the All-China Sports Federation, our country's amateur sports organization, and the issue of our country's membership. This is absolutely intolerable for the people of our country. The people of our country will fully support the All-China Sports Federation in carrying out a resolute struggle to completely defeat the conspiracy of some countries to exclude our country.

The participation of our country, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries has given new meaning to this Olympic Games. This was the first time that Soviet athletes participated in the Olympic Games, and they created excellent results in various competitions, showing good sportsmanship, a high degree of training, an enterprising spirit, and strong perseverance, and were therefore universally praised by athletes from all countries. Soviet athletes scored a total of 494 points in all sports, achieving the highest total score, which reflects the fact that the sports industry in socialist countries, like its economic and cultural construction, has a high level of achievement. Athletes from various people's democratic countries also achieved victories in many sports events during the competition. Hungary ranked third in the overall score due to its excellent performance in soccer, water polo, swimming, gymnastics, and other sports. Czechoslovak athletes won the long-distance running (5,000 meters, 10,000 meters, marathon), women's javelin and other sports events. The superior performance of the Soviet Union and the athletes from the people's democratic countries has added new vitality to the Olympic Games and vividly demonstrated the powerful strength of the socialist system and the people's democratic system.

During the Games, some countries used improper means to steal victories. For example, the judging committee, headed by Americans, and some referees deliberately reduced the scores of Soviet and other countries' athletes with incorrect and unfair judgments, and deliberately raised the scores of some countries' athletes to make them win. This despicable practice, which violates the spirit of honesty and fairness, shows the moral and sports spirit of those countries. The Soviet delegation and the Finnish press severely criticized this phenomenon. Facts have proved that such unfair referees cannot win victories in sports for those countries.

Through the friendly competitions of this International Olympic Games, the people of all countries have further increased their mutual understanding and contact. This is not only reflected in the honest and friendly attitude of athletes from all countries in the competition and the friendly gatherings between each other, but more importantly, athletes from all countries and people of all countries have sincere wishes to strengthen international friendship and peace. Therefore, this Olympic Games not only achieved significant results in sports competitions, but also played an important role in promoting world peace.

    国际述评
    日本人民要求解散国会提前大选
    近来日本人民要求推翻吉田反动政府的呼声是越来越高涨了。虽然现任众议员应到明年一月满期，但各在野党派都提出了解散国会，提前举行大选的主张。这种局势是现在日本的执政党——自由党日益露骨地实行卖国政策所造成的。自由党执政四年以来，处处都证明了它执行的是反动卖国的政策，它是美国占领者的百依百顺的走狗。从去年九月以来，吉田政府和美国签订了非法的单独“和约”、美日“安全条约”、“行政协定”以及军事基地协定等一连串的丧权辱国、危害人民的条约；同时它又在美国的指使下，制订了“防止破坏活动法案”等一连串的法西斯法案。自由党操纵的日本国会已变成美国在日本实行占领制度的工具。这就使吉田自由党的反动本质在日本人民面前暴露无遗，并遭到广大人民的唾弃和反对。
    还在今年一月间，日本共产党就提出反帝、爱国、统一的选举纲领，并发出了“打倒卖国的自由党政府”，“建立民族解放联合政府”的号召。四月以来日本劳动人民所举行的五次全国规模的罢工和伟大的“五一”劳动节的斗争，给吉田反动政府以沉重打击，并给日本的政治形势带来深刻的影响。六月下旬，社会党左派召开中央委员会扩大会议，讨论大选问题。社会党左派认为：“吉田内阁犯有和甲级战犯同样的罪行。理由是它忽视宪法，破坏民主主义，强行重整军备。”社会党右派于最近制订的选举纲领中，也提出“反对重整军备和反对修改宪法”的主张。甚至于在自由党内部，也有一部分人鉴于日本人民对吉田政府卖国政策的极端痛恨，吉田内阁已陷于严重的危机中，因而他们也说：“我坦率地承认自由党今天已面临末日。国民的批评将在下届大选中充分发挥出来。”
    但是吉田反动集团仍然企图在下届大选中维持自己的统治，目前它正在进行各种布置，以便控制选举。这种布置主要是修改现行的选举法。据“朝日新闻”称，修改选举法的目的是“大规模限制选举运动”，其要点有：缩短选举运动期限；全面禁止挨户访问，禁止张贴选举运动的宣传画，限制街头讲演、个人讲演会、报纸和杂志的报道和评论；提高选举人保证金两倍以上；并禁止提出候选人不足二十五人的小党派的选举活动。许多自由党人更在进行无耻活动和欺骗宣传。自由党农林大臣广川弘禅上月发表了所谓“大米自由售卖政策”，企图拢络和欺骗农民。“朝日新闻”也说：“那不外是自由党的痛苦挣扎的选举措施而已。”
    日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”最近曾号召日本工人阶级加强选举斗争，并揭露了自由党的阴谋活动。日本人民必将团结在民族解放民主统一战线的周围，为打倒卖国的吉田政府，建立民主联合政府，和取消美国占领制度而斗争。
    美方继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判
    从七月四日开始举行的朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团
    大会行政性会议，因美方在二十多天的会上始终玩弄欺诈手段，我方于七月二十五日宣布恢复公开谈判。但是美方在进入公开谈判后，继续采取拒绝开会，拒绝协商的态度，就在二十六日第一天的公开会议上，美方首席代表哈利逊便片面决定休会七天，并中途从会场逃跑；双方代表团大会于八月三日复会后，哈利逊竟又坚持再休会七天；到八月十一日双方代表团大会复会时，哈利逊又再次建议休会到八月十七日。美方这种横暴行为，使朝鲜停战谈判继续受到严重的障碍。
    行政性会议十八次会议的记录，揭穿了侈谈“诚意”的美方代表的虚伪面目。哈利逊在七月一日双方代表团大会上表示：美方愿意在停战谈判中唯一剩余的战俘遣返问题上，寻求“一个在合理程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”，并提出以停战协定草案第五十一款关于释放和遣返双方收容的全部战俘的原则，作为解决遣俘问题的基础。可是在行政性会议上哈利逊却无理地说：“假使停战能达成的话，它必须完整地保存联合国军在不强迫遣返战俘原则上的立场。”这就是说，美方仍然坚持它的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张。其实目前唯一障碍停战谈判达成协议的遣俘问题，只是依据双方已同意的停战协定草案第五十一款和五十二款的原则，如何校正应遣返的全部战俘的名单的问题。在行政性会议上我方代表认为，只要美方重新校正的名单是一个切合实际的、已为美方承认的接近十一万六千人的数字，并包括中国人民志愿军两万被俘人员在内，遣俘问题就可以解决。但是哈利逊在七月十三日的行政性会议上却推翻了七月一日所作的诺言，提出只愿遣返八万三千我方被俘人员的无理方案。根据这个方案，百分之二十的朝鲜人民军被俘人员和百分之六十八的中国人民志愿军的被俘人员将被美方强迫扣留。美方这个方案虽然在遣俘的数目上较前略有增加，但依然没有放弃强迫扣留我方被俘人员的卑鄙目的。哈利逊在行政性会议期间玩弄的欺诈手段证明，他在七月一日所说的“诚意地觅求停战，以终止朝鲜的流血”这句话，只不过是一句可耻的谎言。事实上，美国侵略者是要借行政性会议的秘密性质的帐幕的掩护，继续阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，以延长朝鲜的流血。
    在会外，美国侵略者继续对中朝人民施用所谓
    “军事压力”。在行政性会议期间和公开会议休会期间，美国飞机对朝鲜的和平设施与和平城市进行了一连串的狂轰滥炸，并连续侵犯我国东北，大规模地屠杀朝中和平居民；最近美国侵略者竟疯狂地计划轰炸朝鲜北部的七十八个城市；美国杀人犯并继续在巨济岛、济州岛和论山等地战俘营打死打伤我方被俘人员达四、五十名之多。很显然，美国侵略者的目的，是企图用轰炸和屠杀等恐吓手段，强使我方接受它的所谓“自愿遣返”也就是强迫扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张，否则，它就要拖延甚至破坏停战谈判。
    我方一向主张应根据一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约与朝鲜停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款的原则合理解决遣返战俘问题。为了促使朝鲜停战早日实现，我方在这个问题上作了一切可能的让步。美国侵略者却利用我方促使朝鲜停战早日实现的决心和诚意，进行扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋。据七月二十七日纽约“指南针日报”载文说：“华盛顿觉得北朝鲜和中国如此决心要达成停战，以致可以叫他们付出一个很高的代价”。可是美国侵略者玩弄欺诈和恐吓手段向我方进行勒索的阴谋已经破产了。我方于七月二十五日提议结束因美方拒绝讨论而失去效用的行政性会议，使美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋在全世界面前再一次暴露出来，受到世界人民正义的谴责。因此，哈利逊又采取了更多和更长时期的逃会来进行拖延和破坏停战谈判的阴谋了。
    目前朝鲜停战谈判的特点是：美国侵略者继续拒绝讨论，拒绝开会，用中断会议的无理手段把谈判进一步推向失败，阴谋继续扩大朝鲜战争。侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特于七月三日公然声称：“目前停战的可能性已经比以前任何时期都小了”（路透社）。人们由此可以看出：美国侵略者目前极力拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，显然是包藏着要在朝鲜继续进行军事冒险的祸心的。
    国际奥林匹克运动会的收获
    第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会已于七月十九日至八月三日在芬兰首都赫尔辛基举行。这次运动会有不同社会制度的七十个国家的运动员参加，进行了十六天的比赛，这对于促进各国人民的和平友谊和加强各国体育活动的交流是有很大作用的。
    某些国家怀着不可告人的政治目的，曾企图把持国际奥林匹克委员会，拒绝我国参加这次运动会。我中华全国体育总会对国际奥林匹克委员会的这一违反奥林匹克章程的无理措施曾提出严重抗议；各国人民对国际奥林匹克委员会排斥我国的举措亦深表不满。这迫使该会最后不得不决定邀请我国参加本届运动会。我国体育代表团于七月二十五日由北京启程并于同月二十九日赶到赫尔辛基。由于遭到上述的无理阻挠和迟发邀请的关系，我国运动员在到达赫尔辛基时，除了游泳外已来不及参加其他项目的比赛了。但是正如我国代表团团长荣高棠在到达赫尔辛基后所说的：“虽然我们来迟了，但我们终究来到了。”这一事实已充分说明某些国家阴谋阻止我国参加运动会的计划已经失败了。
    但是，这并没有使那些敌视我国的某些国家甘心。国际奥林匹克委员会、国际业余篮球联合会、国际业余田径赛联合会依然对我国业余体育组织中华全国体育总会的合法地位及我国会籍问题，采取了保留、拖延以及其他毫无道理的处理。这是我国人民绝对不能容忍的。我国人民将全力支持中华全国体育总会进行坚决斗争，以彻底击败某些国家企图排斥我国的阴谋。
    我国、苏联和各人民民主国家的参加，使这届奥林匹克运动会有了新的意义。这是苏联运动员第一次参加奥林匹克的比赛，他们在各项比赛中都创造了优异的成绩，表现了良好的体育道德、高度的训练、进取的精神和坚强的毅力，因而受到了各国运动员的普遍赞扬。苏联运动员在各项运动中的得分总数共为四百九十四分，获得了最高的总分，这反映了社会主义国家的体育事业正如它的经济和文化建设一样，有着高度的成就和水平。各人民民主国家的运动员在比赛中也在许多项目方面取得了优胜。匈牙利由于在足球、水球、游泳、机巧运动以及其他运动项目的优胜成绩，而得了总分第三名。捷克斯洛伐克运动员在长跑（五千公尺、一万公尺、马拉松赛跑）、女子标枪等项运动中获得了优胜。苏联及人民民主国家运动员的这种优越成绩，为奥林匹克运动会增加了新的活力，并生动地表现了社会主义制度和人民民主制度的强大力量。
    在运动会中某些国家为了窃取优胜，曾使用了不正当的手段。如以美国人为主席的裁判委员会及某些裁判就曾故意以不正确和不公平的裁判来减低苏联及其他国家运动员的成绩，并故意抬高某些国家运动员的成绩，以使之取得优胜。这种违反诚实和公平精神的卑劣做法，表现了那些国家的道德和体育精神的堕落。苏联代表团及芬兰报界对这种现象曾加以严厉的指责。事实证明，这种不公正的裁判并不能为那些国家在运动方面取得优胜。
    通过这次国际奥林匹克运动会的友好比赛，各国人民进一步增进了相互之间的了解和联系。这不仅表现在各国运动员在比赛中的诚实友好的态度和相互之间的友好联欢，更重要的是各国运动员与各国人民都怀抱着加强国际友好与和平的真诚愿望。因而这次奥林匹克运动会不仅在体育比赛方面取得了重大的成绩，而且对促进世界和平方面也起了重要的作用。
