    Giving Play to Organizational Strength, Combining Supply and Marketing Closely
    Shandong Province's Cooperatives Achieve Good Results in Purchasing New Wheat
    Cooperatives at all levels in Shandong Province actively cooperate with state-owned grain companies to purchase new wheat. In the work of purchasing new wheat, cooperatives at all levels generally implemented the policy of relying on grassroots organizations, giving play to the strength of the masses, and closely combining supply and marketing, achieving significant results. Shandong cooperatives at all levels established 1,952 basic purchasing points, convened member representative meetings and member group meetings respectively, signed pre-purchase contracts, and purchased new wheat in a planned manner. From the beginning of June to the beginning of August, cooperatives throughout the province purchased more than 550 million catties of new wheat, accounting for 84.58 percent of the total purchase by state-owned grain companies. Cooperatives at all levels adopted the method of bringing goods to the countryside, purchasing new wheat on the one hand, and selling goods on the other. In June and July, production materials and consumer goods worth a total of 164.9 billion yuan were supplied to the masses. The sales volume of grassroots cooperatives generally increased compared with the past. The sales volume of Tai'an County Cooperative, a major wheat producing area, increased five and a half times in June compared with May. Due to the timely purchase of new wheat by cooperatives at all levels, the price of wheat has remained stable this year, which satisfies the farmers. In some areas, private merchants once lowered prices to purchase wheat, but this phenomenon changed after the cooperatives began purchasing.
    In order to complete the task of purchasing new wheat well, many grassroots purchasing points put forward the slogans of "three diligences" (diligent hands, diligent legs, diligent mouths) and "three accuracies" (accurate weighing, accurate calculation, accurate payment). Tai'an County Cooperative adopted the experience of last year, adopted the methods of setting up stations at warehouses, direct transportation, and reasonable division of labor, and the purchasing efficiency was doubled compared with last year; the county purchased 21.25 million catties of wheat, saving more than 170 million yuan in purchasing costs compared with last year. The loss rate of Xinqiao Cooperative in Guangrao County decreased from 5 per thousand last year to 1.255 per thousand.
    Cooperatives in various parts of Shandong implemented the policy of "better price for better wheat," and mobilized the masses through grassroots purchasing points and member groups and mutual aid teams to dry and winnow the new wheat, and implemented mutual comparison and evaluation to ensure the quality of the new wheat. This year, the lowest moisture content of wheat purchased in Gaomi County, a wheat-producing area, was 11.4 percent (the standard moisture content is 13 percent), and the lowest impurity content was 1.7 percent (the standard impurity content is 2 percent), all of which met the regulations. This has laid a favorable foundation for the country's grain storage, transportation, and reduction of losses.
    Because the cooperatives satisfied the farmers' requirements for selling wheat, their prestige among the masses has greatly increased. The fact that the Jiaozhou Special District Cooperative developed more than 24,000 members in June and July, increased shares by more than 790 million yuan, and absorbed 4.38 million catties of wheat in actual storage is a good example.

    发挥组织力量，供销密切结合
    山东省合作社收购新麦成绩很好
    山东省各级合作社积极配合国营粮食公司收购新麦。各级合作社在收购新麦工作中，一般都贯彻了依靠基层组织，发挥群众力量，供销密切结合的方针，获得显著成绩。山东各级合作社设立了一千九百五十二处基本收购点，分别召开了社员代表会和社员小组会，签订预购合同，有计划地收购新麦。从六月初到八月初，全省合作社共收购新麦五亿五千余万斤，占国营粮食公司总收购量百分之八十四点五八。各级合作社采用了带货下乡的办法，一面收购新麦，一面销售货物。在六、七两月，供应群众的生产资料和生活资料，共值一千六百四十九亿元。基层社销货额较前普遍增加，主要产麦区泰安县合作社六月份销货额较五月份增加五倍半。由于各级合作社及时收购新麦，今年麦价始终保持稳定，农民都很满意。个别地区曾经发生私商压价收购现象，合作社开始收购以后，这种现象就改变了。
    为了很好地完成收购新麦任务，不少基层收购点都提出“三勤”（手勤、腿勤、嘴勤）、“三准”（秤准、计算准、付款准）的口号。泰安全县合作社接受去年的经验，采取了就仓设站、直线运输、合理分工的办法，收购效率比去年提高一倍；全县收购了二千一百二十五万斤小麦，比去年节省收购费用一亿七千多万元。广饶县辛桥合作社损耗率由去年千分之五降低到千分之一点二五五。
    山东各地合作社贯彻了“优麦优价”政策，并通过基层收购点和社员小组、互助组发动群众把新麦晒干、扬净，并实行互比互评，以保证新麦的质量。产麦区高密县今年收购的小麦含水量最低达百分之十一点四（标准含水量是百分之十三），含杂量最低达百分之一点七（标准含杂量是百分之二），全部合于规定。这样就给国家粮食保管、调运、降低损耗打下了有利基础。
    由于合作社满足了农民售麦的要求，它在群众中的威信大大提高了。胶州专区合作社在六、七月份发展社员二万四千余人，增加股金七亿九千余万元，吸收存实小麦四百三十八万斤，就是一个很好的例子。　（韩　寰）
