Nationwide, 400,000 Workers Participate in the Huai River Project

For over a year, 400,000 workers of various trades across the country have participated in the great Huai River project. Some, in factories in cities like Shanghai, Jinan, Yantai, Tianjin, Beijing, Taiyuan, Anshan, Shenyang, and Hankou, sweat profusely day and night in stuffy workshops, urgently producing machinery for the Huai River project. Others, in the scorching heat of summer or amidst the wind and snow of the Huai River construction sites, bury themselves in hard work.

These 400,000 workers include industrial workers from various trades such as machinery, construction, hardware, electrical, railway, postal and telecommunications, sailors, and stevedores, as well as artisans such as blacksmiths, carpenters, stonemasons, and bamboo workers. All have played a significant role in the Huai River project. Over the past year, machinery, hardware, and other workers in factories in cities like Shanghai have manufactured hundreds of thousands of tons of equipment for the project. In Shanghai alone, over 120 factories with more than 10,000 workers were rushing to produce materials for the Huai River project last year. Transportation workers have also contributed significantly. To strengthen communication at the construction sites, postal and telecommunications workers in Henan, Northern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu actively erected telephone lines, with long-distance wired telephones installed at each site. To resolve transportation difficulties for the construction of the Baisha Reservoir and Banqiao Reservoir, more than 4,000 flatbed workers from Zhengzhou and Kaifeng arrived at the construction sites at the start of construction this spring. In Bengbu, a transportation hub for Huai River materials, 4,000 stevedores and 3,000 sailors participated in handling materials for the project. Whether on the construction sites, in factories, or on land and water transportation lines, workers from all trades have regarded the Huai River project as a glorious task, demonstrating remarkable enthusiasm in their work. Shortly after the commencement of the Foziling Reservoir, a drilling team accepted an urgent task to drill ten wells. The workers immediately launched a fervent competition, with many groups launching all-out assaults, completing the task in ten days and ten nights. Countless examples exist of factory workers actively rushing to produce materials for the Huai River project. For instance, a factory under the Shenyang Machine Tool Plant received an order for a batch of dump trucks last November. The batch was scheduled to be completed in installments, with 200 trucks due in November, but the workers rushed to complete the work, delivering 250 trucks. The workers at Shanghai Bao Fook Kee Steel Construction Factory, buoyed by their victory in the "Five-Anti" campaign, displayed even greater enthusiasm when accepting orders for Huai River materials. The workers stated that they would carefully inspect raw materials and finished products to prevent the capitalists from cutting corners, and guaranteed to complete the task ahead of schedule. Riveters started their furnaces and heated the rivets before work every morning to save time, and turned on the air compressors, starting work as soon as the time came. Yao Jinbao, a veteran electrician, also proposed a rationalization suggestion, improving the manufacturing method of the sheave shaft on the winch (used to open and close the gates), reducing the time required to complete the task from twenty-one days to one and a half days.

Workers working on the Huai River construction sites are united with the civilian laborers - the peasants - like a family, working together for the Huai River project. In their work, they patiently taught many advanced technologies to the peasants. At the Baisha Reservoir construction site, more than 70 of the 200 civilian laborers from Yuxian who worked with the workers for a long time learned to operate rock drills and pour concrete. During the year and more of construction of the Banqiao Reservoir, 3,700 civilian laborers, with the patient education and assistance of the workers, learned to operate or repair modern production tools and machines, including wiring, track laying, drilling, driving, mixing concrete, and repairing machines. Among them, 587 outstanding civilian laborers have voluntarily applied to join the Huai River Engineering Brigade.

### 全国四十万工人参加治淮工程

    全国四十万工人参加治淮工程
    一年多来，全国有四十万不同作业的工人，参加了伟大的治淮工程。他们有的在上海、济南、烟台、天津、北京、太原、鞍山、沈阳和汉口等城市的工厂里，在闷热的车间里，汗流浃背地日夜赶制治淮工程的器械；有的在炎夏或风雪交加的淮河工地上埋头实干着。
    四十万工人，有些是机械、建筑、五金、电气、铁路、邮电、海员、搬运等各种作业的产业工人，有些是铁工、木工、石工、竹工等各种手工业工人。他们在治淮中都起了重大的作用。一年多来，机械、五金等工人在上海等城市的工厂里，为治淮工程制造了数十万吨的器材。去年仅上海一地，赶制治淮器材的，就有一百二十多家工厂的一万多工人。至于交通、运输工人，对治淮也出了很大的力。为了加强工地上的联系，河南、皖北和苏北各地的邮电工人在工地上积极架设了电线，各工地上都架设有长途有线电话。为了解决修建白沙水库和板桥水库的运输困难，郑州、开封两市四千多平车工人，今春施工开始即赶到了工地。治淮物资运输枢纽的蚌埠市，参加搬运治淮物资的搬运工人达四千人，海员工人达三千人。不论在治淮工地上，在工厂里，或者在水陆交通线上，各业工人都把治淮工作当作光荣的任务，在工作中发挥了惊人的积极性。佛子岭水库开工不久，一队钻探工人接受了钻探十个井的紧急任务，工人们便立即展开了热烈的竞赛，很多小组都全力突击，结果，十天十夜就完成任务。各工厂工人积极赶制治淮器材的例子更不胜枚举。如沈阳机器制造厂某厂去年十一月承制了一批斗车，这批斗车预定分批完成，十一月应交二百辆，但工人们突击赶制，结果交了二百五十辆。上海包福记钢铁建筑厂的工人们，因为“五反”获得胜利，接受治淮器材订货时热情更高。工人们表示：这次一定要仔细检查原料和成品，不使资方偷工减料，并保证提前完成任务。铆钉工人为了争取时间提前完工，每天早晨开工之前即生好炉子，烧好铆钉，开足空气压缩机，时间一到就开工。电焊部门老师傅姚金宝并提出合理化建议，改进绞车（启闭闸门用的）上滑轮轴的制法，使原来需要二十一天完成的任务一天半就完成了。
    在治淮工地上作工的工人，他们和民工——农民团结得像一家人，共同为治淮努力。工作中，他们耐心地把许多先进技术教给了农民。白沙水库工地上，长期和工人一起工作的禹县二百多个民工中，有七十多人学会操纵开山机和浇灌混凝土。修建板桥水库的一年多时间内，有三千七百名民工，在工人们耐心教育和帮助下，已学会了近代化生产工具机器的操作或修理，包括架线、铺轨、钻探、驾驶、拌合混凝土、修理机器等。其中有五百八十七名优秀的民工，已自愿申请参加治淮工程大队。
