Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 5th. (Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent)
The first words spoken by the US armistice negotiation representative Harrison upon returning to Panmunjom a week after his walkout were: "We have nothing to say." He then requested another week's recess. Harrison is clearly executing Washington's plan to refuse negotiation, interrupt the conference with a long recess, and thus push the Korean armistice negotiations, which have been going on for over a year, to the edge of a cliff.

The American representatives have used every means except publicly breaking off the negotiations. After Harrison fled the conference tent in June, General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai warned Clark: "If your side intends to break off the negotiations through this, then your side should publicly announce it and bear the responsibility." General Nam Il also warned Harrison that if he wanted to resolve the remaining issue of prisoner of war repatriation, he should honestly sit down at the negotiating table and negotiate.

General Nam Il emphasized that if Harrison abided by the principles already agreed upon by both sides and the Geneva Convention, the problem could be resolved immediately. The Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly put forward fair proposals that fully comply with the spirit of the Geneva Convention: that is, all foreign armed personnel captured by both sides should be repatriated home; Korean armed personnel captured by both sides whose families are in the area controlled by the detaining side can be allowed to return home and do not need to be repatriated. The Korean and Chinese representatives agreed to repatriate all American, British, and other foreign prisoners they detained. The problem is that the US representative refuses to repatriate all Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, preventing them from returning home to live peaceful lives. He wants to trample on the Geneva Convention and use the lives of prisoners of war for political blackmail.

Increasing signs indicate that the American negotiating representatives have no intention of reaching a Korean armistice agreement. The day before Harrison requested another week's recess, American artillery shelled the Panmunjom conference area for three hours. Shrapnel landed within 20 to 30 meters of the new marker inside the conference area. Security officers from both sides dug up shell fragments in several places. Farmers who witnessed the shelling said that shell fragments rained down on the roofs and fields inside the conference area.

Agents from American positions continued to infiltrate the area controlled by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army through the neutral conference area. Sixteen-year-old agent Xu Shihe was captured on July 29th as soon as he walked out of the conference area. He revealed that the American spy team stationed near Panmunjom sent him through the Panmunjom conference area to infiltrate Kaesong to collect military intelligence.

American bombers and jets violate the agreement prohibiting overflight of the neutral zone, flying low over Kaesong in broad daylight every day.

In the staff officer meetings, the American staff officers delayed the final confirmation of the wording of the draft armistice agreement for ten days. Only through our side's firm efforts could the wording of the entire draft armistice agreement be finalized on the 5th.

It is firmly believed here that the American representatives will not gain anything by playing rogue tactics at the negotiating table. It only proves that the United States is not sincere and does not want an armistice. The tactic of "nothing to say," and the provocative actions outside the conference tent, will only lead to greater failure for the American government. As General Nam Il pointed out to Harrison, the meeting can be temporarily adjourned based on Harrison's insistence, but "time will prove to your side that your actions are completely unhelpful in resolving the problem."

    新华社记者评美方拖延停战谈判的行为
    【新华社开城五日电】本社特派记者报道：美方停战谈判代表哈利逊在逃会一星期后回到板门店所说的第一句话就是：“我们无话可说”，接着他就要求再休会一个星期。哈利逊显然是在执行华盛顿的计划，要想拒绝协商，以长期休会的方法来中断会议，从而把进行了一年多的朝鲜停战谈判推到悬崖的边缘上。
    美国代表除了还没有公开破裂谈判外，什么手段都使用了。在六月间哈利逊从会议帐篷逃走后，金日成将军和彭德怀将军就向克拉克发出警告说：“如果你方意欲借此破裂谈判，那你方就应公开宣布，承当责任。”南日将军也警告哈利逊说，如果他想解决剩下的遣返战俘问题，他就应当老老实实在会议桌前坐下来进行谈判。
    南日将军着重指出：如果哈利逊遵守双方已经协议的原则和日内瓦公约，问题就可以立刻得到解决。朝中方面曾多次提出完全符合于日内瓦公约精神的公平方案：即双方所俘获的外国武装人员应全部遣返回家；双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员其家在收容一方地区者可以许其就地回家，不必遣返。朝中代表同意遣返他们所拘留的全部美、英和其他外国俘虏。问题在于：美方代表拒绝遣返全体中国人民志愿军战俘，不让他们回家过和平生活。他想践踏日内瓦公约，用战俘的生命来进行政治敲诈。
    日益增多的迹象说明美国谈判代表无意达成朝鲜停战协议。就在哈利逊要求再休会一周的前一天，美国大炮向板门店会场区轰击三小时之久。榴霰弹直落到会场区内离新标志二十到三十公尺的地方。双方安全军官在好几个地方都挖出了炮弹碎片。作证人的农民说：炮弹碎片如雨点般地落在会场区内的屋顶和田地上。
    来自美国阵地的特务继续利用中立的会场区潜入朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军控制的区域内，十六岁的特务徐世河在七月二十九日一走出会场区就被捉住。他透露：驻在板门店附近的美国间谍队派他经过板门店会场区潜入开城搜集军事情报。
    美国轰炸机与喷气飞机违反禁止飞越中立区的协议，每天于光天化日之下在开城上空低飞。
    在参谋会议上，美国参谋人员拖延停战协定草案措辞的最后确定达十天之久。仅仅由于我方的坚定努力，全部停战协定草案的措词才能在五日确定下来。
    此间坚定地认为：美国代表在会议桌上耍无赖手段是得不到什么好处的。它适足以证明美国没有诚意，不想停战。“无话可说”的策略，和会议帐篷以外的挑衅行动，只能使美国政府遭到更大的失败。正如南日将军向哈利逊指出的，会议尽可以根据哈利逊所坚持的意见暂时停开，但是“时间会向你方证明，你方的这种行动完全无助于问题的解决”。
