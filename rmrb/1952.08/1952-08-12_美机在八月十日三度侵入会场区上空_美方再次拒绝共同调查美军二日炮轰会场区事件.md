Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 11th: U.S. aircraft violated the agreement again on the 10th, intruding into the Panmunjom conference area airspace three times. This morning, our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, lodged a protest with the U.S. side regarding this matter. At the same liaison officer meeting, the U.S. chief liaison officer, McCassey, again unreasonably denied the August 2nd U.S. military shelling of the conference area incident and stubbornly refused to conduct a joint investigation.

　　At 7:00 PM on the 10th, U.S. aircraft, taking advantage of the no-attack zone of the conference area, repeatedly flew over Panmunjom at low altitude three times, conducting strafing attacks on nearby areas. Security officers from both sides in the conference area jointly witnessed the incident. A similar intrusion of the conference area by U.S. aircraft occurred just a week prior (on the 4th). The U.S. side refused to jointly observe that incident at the time it occurred and then denied it groundlessly afterwards. Colonel Zhang Chunshan demanded on the 11th that the U.S. side handle these violations of the agreement responsibly and immediately take all necessary measures to strictly restrain U.S. military personnel to ensure compliance with the agreement.

　　Regarding the August 2nd U.S. military shelling of the conference area incident, for which the evidence is conclusive and even U.S. security officers cannot deny, Colonel Zhang Chunshan pointed out: There was an agreement between the two sides that whenever any violation of the agreement occurred, both sides must agree to any request from either side to conduct a joint investigation. Colonel Zhang Chunshan said: Regarding this very clear fact, already admitted by the security officers of both sides, the U.S. side irresponsibly and brazenly refuses to conduct a joint liaison officer investigation, which constitutes a double violation of the agreement between the two sides. The U.S. side must bear full responsibility for the consequences arising from this irresponsible attitude towards the common agreement between the two sides.

　　It is worth noting that since August, the armistice negotiation meetings have only been held twice, totaling seventy minutes, due to Harrison's insistence on a recess. However, during the same period, the U.S. side has carried out as many as three provocative incidents in violation of the agreement. Thanks to our efforts, the Korean armistice was already within reach. However, the U.S. side clearly wants to use recesses, incidents, and stubborn denials to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations.

### 美机在八月十日三度侵入会场区上空  美方再次拒绝共同调查美军二日炮轰会场区事件

    美机在八月十日三度侵入会场区上空
    美方再次拒绝共同调查美军二日炮轰会场区事件
    【新华社开城十一日电】美机十日又违反协议，三度侵入板门店会场区上空。十一日晨我方首席联络官张春山上校就此事对美方提出抗议。在同一次联络官会议上，美方首席联络官麦卡塞对八月二日美军炮击会场区事件再度无理抵赖，横蛮地拒绝进行共同调查。
    十日下午七时，美机利用免受攻击的会场区，连续三次低空飞越板门店，对附近地区俯冲攻击，会场区的双方安全军官，共同目击此次事件。美机侵犯会场区的事件，仅仅一周之前（四日），已发生过一次。美方对该次事件，在发生的当时即拒绝共同观察，事后又毫无根据地信口否认。张春山上校十一日要求美方认真负责地处理这些违反协议事件，并立即采取一切必要措施严格约束美方军事人员，以保证对协议的遵守。
    关于证据确凿，连美方安全军官也无法否认的八月二日美军炮击会场区事件，张春山上校指出：双方有过协议，无论何时发生了任何违反协议事件，必须同意任何一方提出的进行共同调查的要求。张春山上校说：关于这个已为双方安全军官承认的十分清楚的事实，美方不负责任地、厚颜无耻地拒绝进行联络官共同调查，这就构成了对双方协议的双重违反。对于双方共同协议采取不负责的态度而引起的后果，美方必须负全部责任。
    值得注意的是，自八月以来，停战谈判会议因哈利逊坚持休会，仅仅开了两次，计共七十分钟，而在同一时期内，美方破坏协议的挑衅事件却发生了三次之多。由于我方的努力，朝鲜停战本已举手可及。但美方却显然想用休会、事件及蛮横抵赖来破坏朝鲜停战谈判。
