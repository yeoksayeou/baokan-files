    Heroic Songs and Dances
    ——On the Volunteer Army's Performance in the "August 1st" Sports Meet Art Competition
    Jin Feng
    We often remember our most beloved people, remembering their life on the Korean front. In the "August 1st" Sports Meet Art Competition, the Volunteer Army Art Troupe, composed of Volunteer Army soldiers and professional artists, vividly portrayed the Volunteer Army fighting on the Korean front through music, dance, and song.
    The sound of the accordion skipped lightly and enthusiastically. During the opening ceremony, we heard "The East is Red" and the majestic Volunteer Army war song, as well as hymns such as "Miao Youth Hero Liu Xingwen." Our soldiers fearlessly and proudly sang: "We will hit the tanks until they billow black smoke, shoot down the planes; silence the cannons, and make the enemy kneel."
    The performance song "One Bullet, One Piece of Candy" profoundly reflects the noble character of the Volunteer Army. The beautiful singing took us to Korea, on the other side of the hills, in the forest bathed in the setting sun, where the Volunteer Army and Korean children were celebrating the anniversary of the Soviet Red Army's liberation of Korea on "August 15th." The little girl, Jin Zhi, smiled innocently, jumped, and sang innocently, shouting "Long live" to the Volunteer Army. The soldiers grinned from ear to ear. Suddenly, we heard a piercing screech. American planes were coming. An American bullet pierced little Jin Zhi's chest. Our soldiers picked up the little girl, clutching the murderous American bullet. He saw a piece of candy from a scattered bag of rice. It was a gift from a lovely little girl from the motherland. The soldier shed tears, holding the bullet in one hand and the candy in the other, thinking of the two lovely little girls: one skipping into school, the other lying silently in a pool of blood. Now, we only hear a crashing sound. Thousands of soldiers rise up, gripping their guns, bayonets flashing coldly, bolts snapping in unison, bullets chambered; to protect the children, to protect their parents, remembering the people's hatred, fighting the American invaders, our Volunteer Army went to the battlefield.
    On the Korean battlefield, art not only serves the soldiers but is also mastered by them. In our Volunteer Army, not only have many outstanding combat heroes emerged, but also many excellent literary and artistic soldiers.
    Appearing on the stage was the author and performer of "Reconnaissance Hero Han Qifa" – artillery soldier Liu Peng. He narrated the story of Han Qifa, the reconnaissance platoon leader he often worked with, going deep behind enemy lines and capturing an American officer alive. His storytelling was simple, vivid, clean, beautiful, and full of extremely vivid images. He spoke from the battle to the wit and courage of our scouts, from the arrogance and stupidity of the enemy to our policy towards prisoners.
    Before us appeared a cook in white clothes, the famous soldier singer Zhang Fusheng. He created "The Cookhouse's Four Seasons Tune," singing about the work of cooks on the battlefield. He sang: "In summer, the weather is hot, and entering the kitchen, sweat drips down; as long as the food is well-made, our hearts feel cool," "In autumn, the autumn wind is cool...Comrades dig fortifications...day and night on the mountain; our cookhouse, takes off cotton uniforms, wraps the food and delivers it to the mountaintop, the comrades eat it and feel warm in their hearts, not afraid of the cool sea breeze on the mountaintop." In every line of his entire song, his deep revolutionary feelings and optimism are permeated, which is extremely infectious. Now this song has been widely spread in the Volunteer Army, and everyone loves to sing it.
    On the Korean battlefield, dance has also become very common. Each service branch has its own vivid, distinct, rhythmic, and characteristic dance, expressing their combat life process optimistically and cheerfully.
    We first saw the engineering corps dance. Engineers opened up mountains and roads on the Korean front, ensuring that supplies from the motherland were continuously transported to the front. Last July, they built an important "August 1st" highway. The task was urgent and had to be opened to traffic before "August 1st." They encountered the rainy season in Korea, and they opened up mountains and built bridges in strong winds and heavy rain. Rainwater often turned their rice into porridge and their vegetables into soup. At the most intense time, they insisted on working twenty-three hours a day. Now, these heroes who personally built bridges and paved roads and were awarded the title of "Pioneers of Road Opening" are performing their engineering corps dance. Their dance is their labor process. They vividly perform the atmosphere, emotions, techniques, and joy of labor. They excavate winding mountain roads, blast mountains, transport stones, saw trees, transport materials, and build bridges. The road is repaired, the bridge is repaired, the cars pass, the cannons pass, and the powerful Volunteer Army marches in columns.
    On the Korean front, dance has developed so widely that it has become an indispensable part of the lives of Volunteer Army soldiers. Last New Year's Eve, tank soldiers of a certain unit dug snow pits under their tanks to sleep in. Comrades missed the motherland, and no one could sleep. Someone said: "How happy the people of the motherland are in front of Tiananmen Square tonight, perhaps dancing all night long!" Someone suggested: "Then let's dance too!" So they danced in the snow next to the tanks. The special meritorious platoon that counterattacked the enemy on the 500 Heights on the south bank of the Han River danced on the position to celebrate the victory. Now these happy and brave tank soldiers and artillerymen have brought their tank dance and artillery dance back to the motherland. In their majestic dance, we see the power of the Volunteer Army's cannons and tanks.
    In the fighting Korea, the frenzied enemy often poured thousands of tons of steel onto the positions of the Volunteer Army. Our soldiers built layers of tunnels in the mountains of Korea. The creators and defenders of these tunnels came out, dancing their tunnel dance. We saw them digging solid stones with shovels and pickaxes, digging into one cave after another, from the front of the mountain to the back of the mountain. When the pickaxe was worn short, they set up their own stove, pulled up the bellows, and struck the pickaxe. The hammers rang, and sparks flew, how magnificent the image of labor! The huge rocks were blasted open, the tunnel was opened, the wood was cut, and the beams were topped. The soldiers stood in front of the copper wall and iron wall tunnels, preparing to attack the enemy.
    The audience applauded warmly, praising these dances extracted from real life, the heroic dances born from labor and combat. A Young Pioneer kept saying to his father sitting next to him: "Our Volunteer Army's program is great, it's great!" A little girl kept saluting the Volunteer Army on the stage when the Volunteer Army paid tribute to the audience.
    The final mini song and dance drama "Short Break" allowed us to see how the Volunteer Army's professional literary and artistic workers combined with the soldiers to carry out company recreational activities. They told kuaiban, recited gun poems, praised heroes, sang about their own grenades, and ridiculed the enemy to their heart's content. They missed the motherland, missed Chairman Mao, and hoped that their battle could ensure that the motherland's factory chimneys would always emit smoke, farmers would cultivate the land with peace of mind and produce more, and build a happy home.

    英雄的歌舞
    ——记“八一”运动大会文艺竞赛会演中的志愿军的演出
    金凤
    我们常常怀念着我们最可爱的人，怀念着他们在朝鲜前线的生活。在“八一”体育运动大会文艺竞赛会演中，由志愿军战士和专业文艺工作者组成的志愿军文艺代表队，用音乐、舞蹈和歌唱，生动地表现了志愿军战斗在朝鲜前线的情景。
    手风琴的声音轻快地热烈地跳荡着，我们在开幕时听到“东方红”和雄壮的志愿军战歌，听到“苗族青年英雄刘兴文”等的颂歌。我们的战士无畏地、自豪地歌唱：“要打得坦克直冒黑烟，打得飞机往下栽；打得大炮成哑吧，打得敌人跪下来。”
    表演歌曲“一粒子弹一包糖”深刻地反映了志愿军的崇高品质。优美的歌声把我们带到朝鲜，在山岗的那边，夕阳照射着的树林里，志愿军和朝鲜儿童在庆祝着“八一五”苏联红军解放朝鲜的日子。小女孩金枝天真地笑呵，跳呵，天真地歌唱，向志愿军喊着“万岁”，战士们乐的抿不上嘴。突然，我们听到刺耳的叫啸，美国飞机来了，美国子弹穿透小金枝的胸膛。我们的战士抱起小姑娘，握紧了杀人的美国子弹，他看到被打散米袋中的一包糖。这是祖国的一个可爱的小姑娘送给他们的。战士流泪了，他一手握紧子弹，一手握紧糖，想起可爱的两个小姑娘；一个蹦蹦跳跳进学堂，一个躺在血泊里一声不响。现在，我们只听到哗啦一声响，千万个战士起来了，握紧枪，刺刀闪寒光，枪栓一齐响，子弹推上膛；为了保卫孩子，保卫爹娘，记住人民的仇，打击美国强盗，我们的志愿军上了战场。
    在朝鲜战场上，文艺不仅仅为战士服务，更为战士所掌握。在我们志愿军中不仅涌现了许多出色的战斗英雄，也出现了不少优秀的文艺战士。
    出现在舞台上的是“侦察英雄韩起发”的作者和演唱者——炮兵战士刘鹏。他说唱和他经常在一起活动的侦察排排长韩起发深入敌后，活捉美国军官的故事。他说得通俗、生动、干净、漂亮，富有极鲜明的形象。他从战斗说到我们侦察员的机智勇敢，从敌人的狂妄愚蠢说到我们的俘虏政策。
    在我们的面前又出现了穿着白衣服的炊事员，这就是有名的战士歌手张福生。他创作了“炊事房四季调”，歌唱战场上炊事员的工作。他唱着：“夏季里天气热，进到了伙房汗珠往下淌；只要菜饭做得好，咱们心里多凉爽”，“秋季里秋风凉……同志们挖工事……每天每夜在山上；咱们炊事房，脱下棉军装，把菜饭包好送到山顶上，同志们吃了心里暖，不怕山顶海风凉。”在他整首歌曲的每一行中，都渗透着他这种深厚的革命感情和乐观主义，极富有感染的力量。现在这支歌已经在志愿军中普遍流传开了，没有一个人不爱唱。
    在朝鲜战场上，舞蹈开展得也很普遍。各兵种都有自己生动、鲜明、有规律、有节奏、有特点的舞蹈，把他们战斗生活的过程乐观愉快地表现出来。
    我们首先看到的是工兵舞。工兵们在朝鲜前线开山辟路，保证着祖国人民支援的物资源源不断运到前方。去年七月，他们修建一条重要的“八一”公路。任务很紧，必须在“八一”前通车。碰上朝鲜的雨季，他们在大风大雨中开大山，修桥梁。雨水常常把他们吃的饭冲成稀饭，把菜冲成汤。最紧张的时候，他们一天坚持二十三个小时的工作。现在就是这些亲身修桥、铺路，获得“开路先锋”称号的英雄们来表演他们的工兵舞。他们的舞蹈就是他们的劳动过程。他们生动地表演了劳动的气氛、情绪、技术和快乐。他们挖掘盘山公路，炸山，运石块，锯树，运材料，架桥梁。路修好了，桥修好了，汽车开过去了，大炮开过去了，强大的志愿军列成纵队也开过去了。
    在朝鲜前线，舞蹈开展得这样普遍，已经成为志愿军战士生活中不可缺少的一部分。去年除夕，某部坦克兵们在自己的坦克底下刨开雪窝睡觉。同志们都想念祖国，谁也睡不着。有人说：“今晚天安门前祖国人民多么高兴呵，也许通宵都在跳舞啦！”有人提议说：“那我们也来跳吧！”于是他们就在坦克旁的雪地里跳开了。在汉江南岸五○○高地反击敌人的特功排，就在阵地上跳舞来庆祝胜利。现在这些快乐勇敢的坦克手们和炮手们，把他们的坦克舞和炮兵舞带回祖国来了，在他们雄伟的舞姿中，我们看到了志愿军的大炮和坦克的威力。
    在战斗的朝鲜，疯狂的敌人经常以千百吨钢铁倾倒在志愿军的阵地上。我们的战士在朝鲜的群山中修起了一层层的坑道。这些坑道的创造者和保卫者出来了，跳着他们的坑道舞。我们看到他们一锹锹、一镐镐地挖掘坚固的石头，挖进一个山洞又挖一个山洞，从山前挖到山后。洋镐磨短了，他们自设炉灶，拉起风箱，打起洋镐，铁锤叮当响，火花飞舞起来，劳动的形象多么壮丽呵！巨大的岩石炸开了，坑道打通了，砍伐木材，顶柱上梁。战士们屹立在铜墙铁壁的坑道前准备出击敌人。
    观众热烈地鼓掌，赞美着这些从实际生活提炼出来的舞蹈，从劳动战斗中产生出来的英雄的舞蹈。一个红领巾的孩子向着坐在他身边的爸爸不住地说：“我们志愿军的节目就是棒，就是棒！”一个小女孩子在志愿军向观众致答礼的时候她不住地向台上的志愿军敬礼。
    最后的小型歌舞剧“小休息”，使我们看到志愿军专业文艺工作者和战士结合一起，开展连队文娱工作的情况。他们说快板，念枪杆诗，表扬英雄，歌唱自己的手榴弹，尽情地嘲笑敌人。他们怀念祖国，怀念毛主席，他们希望自己的战斗能保证祖国工厂烟囱常冒烟，农民安心种地多生产，建设幸福的家园。
