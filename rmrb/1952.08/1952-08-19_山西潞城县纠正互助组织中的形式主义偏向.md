    Correcting Formalistic Tendencies in Mutual Aid Organizations in Lucheng County, Shanxi

    To the Editor: Lucheng County, Shanxi Province, currently has 2,601 mutual aid teams (an increase of 63% compared to last year), with the number of households participating in mutual aid teams accounting for 86% of the county's total households. The number of mutual aid teams has developed rapidly, but many are not very solid. In the Fourth District of the county, there were only 288 mutual aid teams last year, but this year the number has increased to 432. Last year, the labor force participating in mutual aid teams accounted for only 15.5% of the total labor force in the district, but this year it has reached 87.8%. According to a recent inspection, 89 of the 432 teams in this district are merely formalistic and lack practical content. Among them, 14 teams have already collapsed. What is the reason for this? According to investigations, some teams had problems from the beginning of their organization. For example, Wang Shutang, the village head of Chige Dao Village, fearing the "Three-Anti" campaign due to his rising economic status and surplus labor and livestock, organized a formalistic mutual aid team this spring. Some teams did not implement reasonable systems such as equal value exchange, failing to stimulate the enthusiasm of team members, and gradually disbanded. The county and district cadres leading this work are only satisfied with the increase in quantity and do not seek to improve quality. The Fourth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has not seriously studied and solved the problems in local mutual aid and cooperative organizations from this spring until now. Lucheng County has now begun to comprehensively rectify the mutual aid teams.

    We hope that all localities will promptly inspect this phenomenon of pursuing quantity while neglecting quality, so that mutual aid and cooperative organizations can be effectively developed and consolidated.

    山西潞城县纠正互助组织中的形式主义偏向
    编辑同志：山西潞城县现有二千六百零一个互助组（比去年增加了百分之六十三），参加互助组的户数占全县总户数的百分之八十六。互助组的数量发展得很快，但有许多很不巩固。该县四区去年只有二百八十八个互助组，今年已增加到四百三十二个；去年参加互助组的劳动力仅占全区总劳力的百分之十五点五，今年已达百分之八十七点八。根据最近检查，这区四百三十二个组中，有八十九个是徒具形式而无实际内容的组。其中有十四个组已经垮台了。这是什么缘故呢？据调查，有的组在开始组织时便有问题。例如赤圪倒村村长王树堂由于经济上升，劳畜力都有富余，他怕“三反”，就在今春组织了一个形式的互助组；有的组没有实行等价交换等合理制度，不能发挥组员的积极性，慢慢地也就散伙了。领导这一工作的县、区干部仅仅满足于数量的增多，不求质量的提高。中共四区区委从今春到现在都没有认真地研究和解决过当地互助合作组织中的问题。现在潞城县已着手普遍整顿互助组。
    对这种追求数量忽视质量的现象，希望各地要及时检查，使互助合作组织切实得到发展和巩固。
