Respected Chairman Mao: You sent a visiting group to our Inner Mongolia, and the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia are sincerely grateful for your deep concern for us. We are the staff of the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Now we report to you on the situation of the people of Inner Mongolia building water conservancy projects and overcoming natural disasters.

On the fertile land of the Horqin League plain flows a large river—the Xiliao River. In the past, whenever the crops were growing vigorously in summer, the river often flooded, submerging large areas of fertile farmland and grasslands along the banks, causing many people to lose agricultural products and pasture. Under reactionary rule, no one cared about the people's suffering. After liberation, the People's Government attached great importance to this major event related to the lives of the vast majority of people, and led and organized the masses to carry out dike repair and flood prevention work. In 1949, the flood of the Xiliao River was rare in decades, but under the leadership of the Communist Party and the rescue efforts of the people, the disaster was greatly reduced. In order to "overcome floods and protect production," in 1950, under the leadership of the Party, the vast masses overcame various difficulties, repaired 930 kilometers of dikes, and built 671 gate and dam structures, completing a huge flood control project. Under the circumstances of the people's poverty and the lack of material and technical conditions, this task was very arduous. The Horqin League only had hundreds of thousands of laborers, but this project used more than four million workdays. This is the victory of the Party's leadership.

In the work of repairing dikes and preventing floods, many model figures and heroic deeds emerged. Labor model Shi Nima improved the labor organization, increasing the work efficiency of each person in the group from four cubic meters to eight cubic meters. During the ice run period, when ice floes rolled down and the dike was in danger of collapsing, he jumped into the water without hesitation and persisted in working in the icy river, where the water was waist-deep, for two days and two nights. Under his leadership, everyone worked together to protect the safety of the dike. Communist Party member Luo Fa led a thousand people to rush to rescue and protect the dike day and night during the flood season, persisting for forty days. Once, while patrolling the dike alone, he discovered a leak in the dike. He jumped into the water without hesitation and used his body to block the hole, preventing the dike from collapsing. It was these many model figures who led thousands of people to fight against floods in a fighting manner, complete the flood control project, and enable the entire league to achieve a bumper harvest in 1950. The masses added carts and bought horses, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly improved.

In 1951, some areas of Inner Mongolia suffered from drought. Under the call of the higher-level government, we launched drought prevention and drought resistance work, and built three irrigation areas in the Horqin League. This spring, in just over twenty days, we completed the spring irrigation work of more than 33,000 hectares in the Horqin League. This has made the crops vigorous, ensured the autumn harvest, and enhanced the masses' confidence in fighting drought.

Chairman Mao: We have deeply realized in our work that under your wise and great leadership, relying closely on the masses, all difficulties can be overcome. Your brilliance shines on our Inner Mongolia region, not only eliminating the national hatred and estrangement caused by the reactionary rulers, but also gradually eliminating the natural disasters left by the reactionary rulers. Now, with the direct assistance of the Central People's Government, we are starting the fundamental management of the Xiliao River. In the near future, the water disasters will be eliminated forever, and the river water will irrigate the fertile land, full warehouses of grain, herds of cattle and sheep, and the people of Inner Mongolia will live a happier and better life.

    内蒙古自治区水利局全体同志
    向毛主席报告兴修水利战胜灾害情况
    敬爱的毛主席：您派了访问团到我们内蒙来，内蒙各族人民都衷心感激您对我们的深切关怀。我们是内蒙古自治区人民政府农牧部水利局的工作人员。现在我们把内蒙人民兴修水利、战胜自然灾害的情况报告给您。
    在哲里木盟大平原肥沃的土地上，流贯着一条大河——西辽河。过去每当夏季庄稼茁壮的时候，往往因河水泛滥，淹没了沿岸大片良田草原，使很多人民失去了农产品和牧草。在反动统治时，人民的痛苦是没有人过问的。解放后，人民政府十分重视这件有关广大人民生活的大事，领导和组织群众进行修堤防汛工作。一九四九年，西辽河的洪水是几十年来少有的，但在共产党的领导和人民的抢救下，灾情大大减轻。为了“战胜洪水，保卫生产”，一九五○年广大人民在党的领导下，克服了种种困难，修堤九百三十公里，修闸坝构造物六百七十一个，完成了巨大的防洪工程。在人民生活贫困、物质技术条件很差的情况下，这个任务是十分艰巨的。哲里木全盟只有十几万个劳动力，但这个工程就用了四百多万个工。这是党的领导的胜利。
    在修堤防汛工作中，出现了不少的模范人物和英雄事迹。劳动模范石尼玛，他改进了劳动组织，使小组每人工作效率由四公方提高到八公方。在凌汛期冰块滚滚下流，大堤有决坍危险时，他奋不顾身跳下水去，在严寒刺骨、水深及腰的冰河里坚持工作两天两夜。在他带动下，大家齐心努力，保住了大堤的安全。共产党员罗发，在防汛期带领一千人昼夜抢险护堤，坚持四十天。有一次他独自巡堤时发现了大堤漏水。他毫不犹豫地跳下水去，用自己的身体堵住漏洞，防止了堤岸决口。就是这许多模范人物带动了千万群众，用战斗的方式战胜了洪水，完成了防洪工程，使全盟在一九五○年获得了丰收。群众添车买马，生产积极性大大提高了。
    一九五一年，内蒙有些地区遭受旱灾。在上级政府号召下，我们展开了防旱抗旱工作，在哲里木盟修了三个灌区。今年春，在短短二十多天中，我们完成了哲里木盟三万三千多垧的春浇工作。这就使田苗旺盛，秋收可保，并增强了群众和旱灾作斗争的信心。
    毛主席：我们在工作中深刻体会到，在您英明伟大的领导下，紧紧依靠群众，什么困难都能克服。您的光辉照耀在我们内蒙地区，不但消除了反动统治者造成的民族仇视和隔阂，也将逐步消除反动统治者遗留下的自然灾害。现在我们在中央人民政府的直接帮助下，着手西辽河的根本治理工作。不久的将来，水患永除，河水灌溉着肥沃的土地，满仓的粮食，成群的牛羊，内蒙人民将过着更加幸福美好的生活。内蒙古自治区人民政府农牧部水利局全体人员
