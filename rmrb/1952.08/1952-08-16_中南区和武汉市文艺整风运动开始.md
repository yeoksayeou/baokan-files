    The rectification movement in literature and art has formally commenced in literary and art institutions, organizations, and schools in the Central South Region and Wuhan City. On the 8th, more than 800 literary and art workers from the Central South Region, Wuhan City, and Hubei Province held a mobilization meeting for rectification study. Chen Huangmei, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central South Bureau, delivered a mobilization report at the meeting. Yu Heiding and Cui Wei, Vice Chairmen of the Central South Literary and Art Circles Federation, made preliminary self-criticisms.

    After explaining the great significance of the rectification study in the literary and art field, Chen Huangmei pointed out that the fundamental and most common shortcomings in the literary and art work of the Central South were serious detachment from politics, detachment from reality, and detachment from the masses. These fundamental shortcomings are particularly reflected in the following aspects: First, the literary and art leading organs and some leading cadres have relaxed the struggle against all non-working-class literary and artistic ideologies; second, they have neglected the ideological remolding of literary and art workers; third, they lack an overall concept for the construction of literary and art undertakings and have serious liberalism; fourth, they lack sufficient attention and guidance to the vigorously developing mass literary and art movement; fifth, in literary and art institutions, organizations, and schools, there is no regular Marxist-Leninist study, and the experience of life and professional study are also done poorly. Chen Huangmei said: This study must establish a clear working-class ideological viewpoint in the minds of literary and art workers, establish the leadership of the working class; and require every literary and art worker to have a high sense of responsibility for the literary and art cause, truly give play to the active forces of literary and art work, and fight for the development and consolidation of the working class's ideology.

    The Central South and Wuhan literary and art rectification movement will be carried out in three steps: first, studying documents, using Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as the basic learning material, and also studying the People's Daily editorial "Continue to Struggle for the Orientation of Literature and Art Proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong," Hu Qiaomu's "Why Literary and Art Workers Should Remold Their Ideology," Zhou Yang's "Rectify Literary and Artistic Thought, Transform Leadership Work" and other documents; second, the inspection stage, each unit will start with leading cadres, level by level to make inspection reports, submitted for mass discussion and comments, everyone will make an appraisal of literary and artistic thought; finally, organizational construction will be carried out, and literary and art organizations and literary and art publications will be rectified.

    中南区和武汉市文艺整风运动开始
    中南区和武汉市文艺机关、团体、学校的文艺整风运动已正式开始。八日，中南区、武汉市和湖北省的文艺工作者八百余人举行了整风学习动员大会。中共中央中南局宣传部副部长陈荒煤在会上作了动员报告；中南文学艺术界联合会副主席于黑丁、崔嵬作了初步检讨。
    陈荒煤在说明了文艺界整风学习的重大意义后，指出了中南文艺工作中所存在的根本的最带普遍性的缺点是严重的脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众。这一根本的缺点，特别显著地反映在以下几个方面：第一、文艺领导机关及一些领导干部放松了对一切非工人阶级文艺思想的斗争；其次是忽视文艺工作者的思想改造工作；第三、对文艺事业的建设缺乏整体观念，有严重的自由主义；第四、对蓬勃发展的群众文艺运动，缺乏足够的重视与指导；第五、文艺机关、团体、学校中，没有经常进行马克思列宁主义学习，体验生活和业务学习也都作得很差。陈荒煤说：这次学习，必须作到在文艺工作者思想上树立明确的工人阶级的思想观点，确立工人阶级的领导；要求每个文艺工作者对文艺事业要有高度的责任感，真正发挥文艺工作的积极力量，为发展和巩固工人阶级底思想而战斗。
    中南、武汉文艺整风运动将要分三个步骤进行：首先是学习文件，以毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”作为基本的学习材料，另外还学习人民日报社论“继续为毛泽东同志所提出的文艺方向而斗争”，胡乔木的“文艺工作者为什么要改造思想”，周扬的“整顿文艺思想，改造领导工作”等文件；其次是检查阶段，各单位都从领导干部开始，逐级作出检查报告，交群众讨论提意见，每个人都要作出文艺思想的鉴定；最后进行组织建设，整顿文学艺术团体和文艺出版物。（新华社）
