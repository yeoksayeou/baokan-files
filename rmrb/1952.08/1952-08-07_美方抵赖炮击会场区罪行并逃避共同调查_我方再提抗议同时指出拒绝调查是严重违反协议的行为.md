Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th – After the U.S. side shelled the Korean armistice talks conference area at Panmunjom on August 2nd, our liaison officer protested to the other side. The other side replied to our liaison officer on August 5th, attempting to shirk responsibility by claiming insufficient evidence. At the liaison officers’ meeting on the 6th, our liaison officer pointed out that the security officers from both sides had conducted a joint investigation of the conference area on August 2nd, unearthing shrapnel. Every witness questioned proved that the shells were fired from the U.S. side's positions. Material evidence and witness testimony irrefutably confirmed the other side’s responsibility, which they could not deny. If the other side still believed the evidence was insufficient, we requested another immediate joint investigation. The text of our liaison officer's protest is as follows:

“Colonel McColla, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Your letter of August 5, 1952, has been received. Regarding the August 2nd violation of the agreement in which your ground forces shelled the conference area, your side cannot deny it. During the joint investigation conducted by the security officers of both sides that day, shrapnel was jointly unearthed, and every witness questioned proved that the shells were fired from your side’s positions. The markers of the newly established conference area boundary also allowed your security officers to confirm that the shrapnel landed within the conference area. The aforementioned facts irrefutably prove that your denial is futile. I reiterate our protest regarding the aforementioned incident. If you still believe the evidence is insufficient, I request that you conduct another joint investigation with us. I must remind you that refusing a joint investigation is a serious violation of the agreement.

Zhang Chunshan, Colonel, Chief Liaison Officer of the Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army Delegation, August 6, 1952”

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th – Regarding the violation of the agreement in which U.S. forces shelled the Panmunjom conference area on August 2nd, the U.S. side is attempting to deny responsibility. Our Chief Liaison Officer Colonel Zhang Chunshan lodged another protest with the U.S. side on the 6th, requesting that the U.S. side conduct a joint investigation. However, U.S. Liaison Officer Robinson attempted to delay and evade the joint investigation.

After the incident of the U.S. side shelling the conference area from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM on August 2nd, the security officers stationed at the conference area from both sides immediately went to the scene to conduct a joint investigation. Many farmers provided eyewitness evidence, confirming that the shells were fired from the U.S. side's positions. At the same time, the security officers from both sides jointly unearthed shrapnel within the newly established conference area boundary markers, and the U.S. security officers had to admit: "I also believe it is indeed within the conference area." The detailed process of the investigation has been recorded.

However, U.S. Chief Liaison Officer McColla sent a letter to our side on the 5th, denying the facts and "rejecting" the protest lodged by our side. At the liaison officers' meeting on the 6th, Colonel Zhang Chunshan quoted the records of the investigation by the security officers of both sides in detail, pointing out: "The facts irrefutably prove that your denial is futile," "If you still believe the evidence is insufficient, I request that you conduct another joint investigation with us." U.S. Liaison Officer Robinson had no way to refute the evidence cited by Colonel Zhang, but refused to conduct an immediate investigation, saying that they still had to "examine the records of the incident before deciding whether another investigation is necessary."

While U.S. Chief Representative Harrison insists on refusing to negotiate, causing the armistice talks to be repeatedly suspended for a long time, the U.S. side is adopting the old method of denying the facts and refusing to investigate, as they did last August with regard to violating the agreement. This situation cannot but arouse serious attention.

    美方抵赖炮击会场区罪行并逃避共同调查
    我方再提抗议同时指出拒绝调查是严重违反协议的行为
    【新华社开城六日电】八月二日美方炮击板门店朝鲜停战谈判会场区，经我方联络官向对方提出抗议后，对方在八月五日复函我方联络官，藉口证据不足，企图推卸责任。我方联络官在六日双方联络官会议上，指出八月二日会场区双方安全军官曾共同进行调查，掘出了弹片，所询问的每一证人都证明炮弹是自美方阵地发射来的。物证和人证都无可争辩地确定了对方的责任，不容对方抵赖。如对方还认为证据不足，我方要求立即再次进行共同调查。我方联络官抗议文如下：“联合国军代表团首席联络官麦卡塞上校：
    你一九五二年八月五日的来信收到了。对于八月二日你方地面部队炮击会场区的违反协议事件，你方是不可能抵赖的。在当天双方安全军官的共同调查中，曾共同掘出了弹片，所询问过的每一个证人都证明炮弹是由你方阵地发射来的，新设的会场区边界的标志使你方安全军官也确认弹片落在会场区内。上述这些事实无可争辩地证明你的否认是徒劳的。对于上述事件我重申我方的抗议。如果你认为证据仍然不足，我要求你同我们一起进行再一次的共同调查。我必须提醒你，拒绝共同调查是严重地违反协议的行为。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席联络官张春山上校一九五二年八月六日”
    【新华社开城六日电】对八月二日美军炮击板门店会场区的违反协议事件，美方企图抵赖责任。我方首席联络官张春山上校为此于六日再度向美方提出抗议，要求美方进行共同调查。但美方联络官罗宾逊却企图拖延及逃避共同调查。
    八月二日下午四时至七时美方炮击会场区事件发生后，双方驻会场区安全军官当即赴现场进行共同调查。许多农民提出目睹的证据，确认炮弹是自美方阵地发射的，同时，双方安全军官并在新设的会场区边界标志之内共同掘出弹片，美方安全军官也不得不承认：“我也认为确实是在会场区内的。”调查的详细经过，都有纪录在案。
    但美方首席联络官麦卡塞于五日却致函我方，抵赖事实，“拒绝”我方所提的抗议。在六日的联络官会议上，张春山上校详细引述了双方安全军官调查的纪录，指出：“事实无可争辩地证明你的否认是徒劳的”，“如果你认为证据仍然不足，我要求你同我们一起进行再一次的共同调查。”美方联络官罗宾逊对张上校引述的证据无话可辩，但又拒不立即进行调查，说什么他们还要“检查事件的纪录后，才能决定另外的调查是否必需”。
    与美方首席代表哈利逊坚持拒绝协商的态度而使停战谈判会议一再长期休会的同时，美方对违反协议事件采取了去年八月矢口抵赖、拒不调查的老办法。这种情况不能不引起人们的严重注意。
