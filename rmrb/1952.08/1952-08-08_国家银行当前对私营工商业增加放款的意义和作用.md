    The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have achieved great victories. In order to further invigorate the market, develop production, and welcome large-scale economic construction, the National Bank has lowered the deposit and loan interest rates for both public and private sectors, and is also increasing loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises. In the process of granting loans, some National Bank staff still have some questions, such as: "Why increase loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises?", "What attitude should be adopted towards private industrial and commercial enterprises?", "How can errors be avoided in granting loans?" These questions must be quickly resolved so that the loan work can be smoothly advanced.
    The Common Program clearly stipulates in Article 30: "The People's Government should encourage the positive spirit of private economic enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and assist their development." The National Bank has consistently implemented the economic policies of the Common Program in this regard. For example, after the unification of financial and economic affairs in March 1950, private industrial and commercial enterprises encountered some difficulties in the process of developing production. The People's Government, according to the needs of the national economic plan and the financial situation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, adopted methods such as processing, ordering, purchasing, and loans to help them solve their difficulties. Among them, for industrial and commercial enterprises whose products must be controlled by the state, processing, ordering, and purchasing methods were adopted in coordination with department stores; for industrial and commercial enterprises that should and could open up sales channels on their own, loans were mainly adopted. These measures played a very good role. This year, private industrial and commercial enterprises, during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the off-season, experienced poor capital turnover due to the stagnation of some markets. In order to invigorate the market and assist private enterprises in normal operation, the state-owned economy continued to expand processing, ordering, purchasing, and loans, and also widely carried out the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The National Bank, in coordination with this task, on the one hand, continued to increase loans to state-owned trade departments and cooperatives to assist in expanding processing, ordering, and purchasing; on the other hand, for private industrial and commercial enterprises whose products are not within the scope of processing, ordering, and purchasing but lack working capital, or whose processing, ordering, and purchasing conditions have not yet been negotiated but production urgently needs to be restored, or who have accepted processing and ordering but currently lack production funds, loans are increased. Through loans, they are encouraged to increase their confidence in management and drive their own funds into production.
    However, in the National Bank, some staff members do not fully understand the role and significance of the state increasing loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises. Therefore, some people do not actively carry out this work, pushing everything to the higher authorities; others, regardless of objective reality, excessively and strictly restrict the granting of loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises. The result is that the loan business is delayed. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have profoundly educated every staff member of state organs, and everyone's ideological awareness has been raised a step. As long as we draw a clear line between ourselves and the bourgeoisie in our thinking and stand firmly on the proletarian stand, we should boldly and responsibly handle the work of granting loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises and resolutely implement the state's policy of granting loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises. Increasing loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises is one of the central tasks of the National Bank at present, and whether or not this work can be treated correctly is a new test for every cadre.
    Of course, in the bank's loan business to private industrial and commercial enterprises, it is also necessary to prevent a purely task-oriented viewpoint and oppose the erroneous practice of blindly granting loans in order to pursue the number of loans. Education should also be carried out for some private industrial and commercial operators who excessively emphasize their difficulties and rely on loans from the National Bank. In the process of granting loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises, the bank should closely cooperate with the local industrial and commercial administrative departments, state-owned enterprise departments, and trade unions. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the Party and the government have strengthened their leadership over private industrial and commercial enterprises, trade unions are also actively paying attention to the development of production, and the organizations of the Federation of Industry and Commerce have been further strengthened. Many cities have organized city-wide or district-level processing, ordering, purchasing, and loan committees (or production committees). The National Bank must establish close contact with this organization, rely on workers to conduct investigations and supervision, and ask the Federation of Industry and Commerce to assist in reviewing each loan applicant. The loan system and procedures should adapt to the new situation and be implemented flexibly after the decision of the local Financial and Economic Committee; under the principle of correctly grasping the spirit of the policy, the loan work should be carried out quickly.
    The object of loans should mainly be based on the needs of the national economy. Some people think that only small loans should be given to small households and not to large households, which is incorrect. Because the rapid activation of large households in important industries in large cities has a greater role in developing the social economy, they must be given importance. Naturally, small loans to small industrial and commercial households should not be neglected either. As for industrial and commercial households with more "five poisons" in the past, if they have been reviewed and dealt with by the government, they should not be excluded from the scope of loans. In this way, private industrial and commercial enterprises can be universally activated. Some people also think that only industrial loans should be given and not commercial loans, which is also incorrect. On the one hand, we should encourage the development of industry and give preferential treatment in terms of interest rates; but for commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, we should also support it, because the active exchange of goods is also conducive to the development of production.
    The National Bank has consistently implemented the correct policy of leading the development of production of private industrial and commercial enterprises. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the leadership of the state-owned economy over private industrial and commercial enterprises has been increasingly strengthened, and the National Bank's leadership over industrial and commercial enterprises must also be further strengthened. The working cadres of the National Bank engaged in private industrial and commercial business must further understand the policy, overcome various incorrect ideological concerns and biases, strive to do a good job in loan work, and promptly check and summarize experience in the work, study and revise the system, and strive to strengthen the National Bank's leadership over private industrial and commercial enterprises.

    国家银行当前对私营工商业增加放款的意义和作用
    佩山
    在“三反”“五反”运动取得了伟大胜利以后，为了进一步活跃市场、发展生产，迎接大规模的经济建设，国家银行已经降低了公营和私营存、放款利率，同时正在对私营工商业增加放款。在进行放款工作中，有些国家银行的工作人员还存在着一些问题，例如：“为什么要对私营工商业增加放款”，“对私营工商业究竟应该采取什么态度”，“放款如何才能避免错误”等。对于这些问题，目前必须迅速加以解决，放款工作才能顺利推进。
    共同纲领第三十条中曾明确规定：“凡有利于国计民生的私营经济事业，人民政府应鼓励其经营的积极性，并扶助其发展。”国家银行在这方面就是一贯地执行共同纲领的经济政策的。例如一九五○年三月统一财政经济以后，私营工商业在发展生产过程中曾遇到一些困难，人民政府即按照国家经济计划的需要及私营工商业的资金情况，曾分别采取了加工、订货、收购、贷款等方式帮助他们解决困难。其中对于国家必须掌握其产品的工商业，就配合百货公司采取加工、订货、收购的方式；对于应该而且可能由自身打开销路的工商业，就主要采取贷款的方式。这些措施都曾起了极好的作用。今年，私营工商业在“三反”“五反”和淡季过程中，由于部分市场的呆滞而出现了资金周转不灵的情况。为了活跃市场，并扶助私营企业进行正常经营，国营经济又继续扩大加工、订货、收购和贷款，同时广泛开展城乡物资交流工作。国家银行配合这个任务，一方面继续增加对国营贸易部门和合作社的贷款，以协助扩大加工、订货和收购；一方面对私营工商业中产品不在加工、订货、收购范围之内而又缺乏流动资金的，或是加工、订货、收购条件尚未洽定而生产又急待恢复的，或是已接受加工、订货而目前生产资金不足的，都增加放款。通过放款推动他们提高经营信心，带动其自有资金投入生产。
    但是，在国家银行中，还有一些工作人员对于国家向私营工商业增加放款的这种作用和意义认识不足。因此，有的人不是积极地进行此项工作，一切事都向上级推；有的人不顾客观实际情况，过分严格地限制对待私营工商业的放款。其结果都是延宕了放款业务的进行。“三反”“五反”运动深刻地教育了每一个国家机关的工作人员，大家的思想觉悟都提高了一步，只要我们划清和资产阶级的思想界限，站稳无产阶级立场，就应当大胆负责地处理对私营工商业的放款工作，坚决地执行国家对私营工商业放款的政策。增加对私营工商业放款是国家银行当前的中心工作之一，能否正确地对待这一工作，正是对每一个干部新的考验。
    当然，在银行对私营工商业的放款业务中，也必须防止单纯任务观点，要反对那种为了追求放款数目字而盲目乱放的错误做法。对于一些过分强调自己的困难而依赖向国家银行贷款的私营工商业者，也应当进行教育。银行在对私营工商业进行放款业务中，应当与当地工商行政管理部门、国营企业部门和工会密切配合。“三反”“五反”以后，党和政府加强了对私营工商业的领导，工会也积极注意生产的发展，工商联组织也已进一步加强。许多城市已经组织了全市的或区的加工订货收购贷款委员会（或生产委员会），国家银行必须与这一机构取得紧密联系，依靠职工进行调查监督，并请工商联协助审查各要求贷款户。贷款制度、手续应适应新的情况，经过当地财政经济委员会的决定变通执行；在正确地掌握政策精神的原则下，应当迅速进行放款工作。
    放款的对象主要应当根据国民经济的需要。有的人认为只应放小户，不应放大户，这是不对的。因为大城市重要行业的大户迅速活跃起来，对发展社会经济的作用是较大的，因此必须予以重视。自然，对于小的工商业户的小额贷款也不应当偏废。致于过去“五毒”较多的工商业户，如果已经过政府审查处理，也不应当列于放款范围之外。这样，才能使私营工商业普遍活跃起来。也有人认为：只应对工业贷款，不应对商业贷款，这也是不对的。我们一方面要鼓励工业的发展，在利率等方面给予优待；但对于有利于国计民生的商业也应扶助，因为物资交流的活跃同样有利于生产的发展。
    国家银行是一贯执行着领导私营工商业发展生产的正确政策的，“三反”“五反”以后，国营经济对于私营工商业的领导日益加强，国家银行对于工商业的领导工作也必须进一步加强。国家银行从事私营工商业业务的工作干部必须进一步体会政策，克服各种不正确的思想顾虑与偏向，努力作好放款工作，并在工作中及时检查、总结经验，研究和修正制度，为加强国家银行对于私营工商业的领导而努力。
