Measures for Uniform Registration of Unemployed Persons

(Approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on August 27, 1952)

Article 1: In order to comprehensively understand the situation of various unemployed persons, so as to handle them separately in a planned and step-by-step manner and achieve labor employment, it is necessary to conduct a unified registration of unemployed persons. These measures are specifically formulated for this purpose.

Article 2: In large and medium-sized cities where labor employment committees have been established according to the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on labor employment issues, the registration of unemployed persons shall be uniformly led by the labor employment committee. An unemployed persons registration office shall be established under the city labor employment committee, and registration sub-offices may be established in different districts as needed to handle registration work. In cities where labor employment committees have not been established, the registration of a small number of unemployed persons may be handled by relevant departments such as civil affairs, labor, or culture and education, and the registration results shall be reported to the provincial labor employment committee.

Article 3: In addition to setting up a small number of full-time cadres, the unemployed persons registration agency may, when handling registration work intensively, temporarily transfer cadres from relevant departments such as labor, personnel, civil affairs, public security, education, and finance committees, as well as relevant organizations such as trade unions, women's federations, and youth federations, to participate in the work, according to actual needs by the labor employment committee.

Article 4: The scope of registration of unemployed persons is as follows:

	1.  Workers and staff who were originally engaged in physical or mental labor in public and private industrial and commercial enterprises, transportation, handicraft workshops, and government agencies, organizations, and schools, as well as construction workers and porters without fixed employers, who have no fixed occupation after unemployment;

	2.  Workers engaged in seasonal industries whose industries have declined and cannot find work;

	3.  Unemployed intellectuals with a junior high school education or above, and former military officers and former officials who have no occupation, have financial difficulties, and require employment;

	4.  Independent producers, peddlers, agents of capitalists, and small industrialists and businessmen who have closed down or suspended operations and have no other income, have financial difficulties, and require employment to engage in wage labor;

	5.  Other unemployed persons who have financial difficulties and require employment.

The above-mentioned unemployed persons are limited to those with a fixed household registration in the city where the registration is being carried out. Unemployed workers and staff living in employee dormitories but not registered in the household registration may register with a certificate from the trade union.

Article 5: The following personnel will not be registered for the time being:

	1.  Those who have no fixed occupation for a long time but have other income or are supported by relatives and can maintain their livelihood;

	2.  Employed personnel who require to change careers or transfer to another factory or location;

	3.  Workers and staff engaged in seasonal industries who stop working during the off-season;

	4.  Students who require to leave school to seek employment;

	5.  Those who originally returned to the countryside from the city and have been properly resettled.

Article 6: Unemployed persons applying for registration shall, in addition to submitting their household registration certificate or household registration certificate letter, also submit the following documents they hold:

	1.  Unemployed workers and staff shall submit documentary evidence issued by their original trade union organization or work unit;

	2.  Unemployed intellectuals and former military officers and former officials shall submit educational and experience certificates;

	3.  Independent producers and small industrialists and businessmen shall submit business closure certificates issued by industrial and commercial management departments and industrial and commercial federations (or trade associations); peddlers shall submit business closure certificates from the management agency to which they belong; agents of capitalists shall submit proof of departure from their original enterprise;

	4.  Other supporting documents held by other unemployed persons.

Article 7: Unemployed persons applying for registration must fill out an application form for unemployed persons registration. After passing the examination, the city labor employment committee will issue a registration certificate.

Article 8: Those who have already registered at the local unemployed workers relief office, labor exchange, or unemployed intellectuals registration agency but have not yet been employed must exchange for a registration certificate. If they do not exchange it, they will be considered employed and the original application form will be cancelled.

Article 9: After registration, unemployed persons should declare to the original registration agency when temporarily leaving the original registration area or moving their residence within the city. If they move to another city, they must go through transfer registration procedures. Those who have been employed and returned to their hometowns shall surrender their registration certificate.

Article 10: The unemployed persons registration agencies established by the labor employment committees of each city shall be revoked after the completion of the comprehensive and unified registration of unemployed persons. The subsequent regular registration work shall continue to be handled by the labor department in accordance with the provisions of these measures.

Article 11: The labor employment committees of various localities may formulate detailed rules for implementation in accordance with these measures.

Article 12: These measures shall be promulgated and implemented after being approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.
