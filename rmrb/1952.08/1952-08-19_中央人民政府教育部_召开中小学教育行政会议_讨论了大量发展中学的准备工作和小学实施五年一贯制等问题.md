Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened a conference on primary and secondary education administration from the 2nd to the 10th of this month. Attending the meeting were the ministers of education from major administrative regions, the directors of cultural and educational departments/bureaus from key provinces and cities, and representatives from relevant central government organs, totaling over 70 people. The main topics discussed at this meeting were: preparations for massively developing secondary schools; issues concerning private primary schools; the implementation steps for a five-year consistent system for primary schools; and absorbing and training unemployed intellectuals as primary and secondary school teachers.

    At the opening of the meeting, Ma Xulun, Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, gave principled instructions on the above-mentioned major issues of developing primary and secondary education. He pointed out that in order to meet the needs of various national construction undertakings, guarantee the source of students for universities and colleges, and increase the opportunities for primary school graduates to pursue further education, massively developing secondary schools, especially ordinary secondary schools, is a crucial issue in educational construction in the next few years. The main problem in developing secondary education is the issue of teachers, and there are many difficulties in solving the teacher problem at present. He then emphasized the need to use revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to tap potential forces to overcome difficulties. Regarding the implementation of the five-year consistent system for primary schools, he said that except for some primary schools in ethnic minority areas, pastoral areas, and economically and culturally backward rural areas where the implementation of the five-year consistent system should be appropriately postponed, primary schools across the country should begin implementing the five-year consistent system from the first grade newly enrolled this autumn, and then gradually promote it year by year, striving to basically realize the five-year consistent system in primary schools across the country within five years. Because the children of the broad masses of workers and peasants urgently demand to attend school, although public primary schools have been increasing year by year, it is still difficult to fully meet the people's requirements at present. Therefore, in the future, primary schools should be mainly public, but the establishment of private primary schools on the basis of the people's genuine willingness should be allowed, and the government must strengthen leadership and assistance to enable them to persist.

    The meeting conducted in-depth research and discussion in groups on the above issues. Representatives from various regions raised the difficulties existing in the development of primary and secondary education. These difficulties were basically resolved through discussion. At the end of the meeting, the "Decision on Solving the Issue of Teachers for Secondary Schools After the Summer Vacation of 1952," "Instructions on the Implementation of the Five-Year Consistent System for Primary Schools," "Instructions on Consolidating and Developing Private Primary Schools," and "Training Plan on Absorbing Unemployed Intellectuals to Cultivate Teachers" and other draft plans were adopted. These decisions and plans will be implemented after being submitted to higher authorities for approval. During the meeting, the representatives widely exchanged experiences in solving the problems of school buildings and teachers in primary and secondary schools, and in-service teacher training, and held an experience exchange conference. The representatives listened to reports on typical experiences such as "The Experience of the Rural Primary School Teachers' Spare-time School in Shahe County, Hebei Province," "The Experience of the Teachers' Weekly In-service Training School in Henan Province," "The Experience of Tianjin Municipality on Improving In-service Teachers and Transforming Intellectuals," "The Situation of Solving the Teacher Problem in the Development of Primary and Secondary Schools in Shandong Province in Recent Years," "The Experience of Implementing the Two-Part System in the Northeast Region," and "The Report on the Experimental Five-Year Consistent System Primary School in Beijing."

    Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Education of the Central Ministry of Education, made a concluding report at the closing meeting entitled "Strive to Improve Teaching Quality to Meet the Needs of the Broad Masses of People and Cultivate Qualified Construction Talents for the Motherland." He emphatically pointed out that in order to cooperate with the country's large-scale economic construction, large-scale educational construction will be carried out. In the next few years, hundreds of thousands of senior construction talents and millions of intermediate construction talents must be trained, and efforts must be made to ensure that more than 80% of school-age children are enrolled in school. The central issue facing educators across the country is how to continuously improve teaching quality. The ideological transformation of teachers is the key to improving teaching quality. Teachers at all levels of schools should continue to carry out self-education and self-transformation, and begin to systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; in schools with the conditions, political work should be established with preparation to continuously improve the political and ideological level of teachers, students, and staff. All regions should refer to the experiences of Tianjin, Shahe in Hebei Province, Harbin, and Henan and other places to establish a regular and systematic spare-time learning system for teachers, especially to establish spare-time in-service training schools combining self-study, lecturing, and correspondence courses. Regarding the implementation of the five-year consistent system for primary schools, Deputy Minister Qian emphasized that the implementation of the five-year system for primary schools is to ensure that the children of the working people receive complete elementary education. We must make the greatest effort to train and improve primary school teachers in the next three years, and strive to have enough teachers to be competent for the teaching tasks of the fourth and fifth grades of the new school system in three years. Regarding private primary schools, he emphasized that a positive approach must be adopted and the following principles must be adhered to: the masses are completely voluntary and not allowed to be forced; the masses have legitimate and reliable ways to contribute money and effort to maintain it for a certain number of years; it is passed by the township people's congress and approved by the county people's government. On the issue of developing secondary schools, he called for vigorously promoting the two-part system, promoting outstanding primary school teachers, and absorbing and training unemployed intellectuals to serve as secondary school teachers, and adhering to teachers' spare-time learning. Deputy Minister Qian also called on educators in various regions to cultivate typical examples in a planned way, promote advanced experiences, select key points to organize teachers to launch competition movements to improve teaching, and organize model teacher conferences and outstanding education worker conferences to summarize and disseminate advanced experiences, so that the work of improving teaching quality becomes a mass movement of teachers across the country. Only in this way can we meet the needs of the broad masses of people and cultivate qualified construction talents of all levels and types for the motherland.

    中央人民政府教育部
    召开中小学教育行政会议
    讨论了大量发展中学的准备工作和小学实施五年一贯制等问题
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府教育部在本月二日至十日召开了中、小学教育行政会议。出席这次会议的有各大行政区教育部部长和重点省、市文教厅、局长以及中央有关机关代表共七十余人。这次会议主要讨论了：大量发展中学的准备工作问题；关于民办小学问题；关于小学五年一贯制的实施步骤问题；和吸收训练失业知识分子作为中小学师资等问题。
    中央人民政府教育部马叙伦部长在会议开幕时，就上述发展中小学教育工作的主要问题作了原则性的指示。他指出：为了适应国家各种建设事业的需要，保证高等学校学生的来源以及增加小学毕业生升学深造的机会，大量发展中等学校，特别是发展普通中学，是今后几年教育建设中的一个带关键性的问题。发展中学教育的主要问题是师资问题，而解决师资问题目前存在很多困难。接着他强调要用革命精神和革命办法，发挥潜在的力量，来克服困难。关于小学实施五年一贯制问题，他说：除部分少数民族地区、游牧区、及经济文化落后农村不正规的小学，五年一贯制的推行，得酌情延缓外，全国小学，从今年秋季新招的一年级起，开始实行五年一贯制，以后逐年顺推，争取在五年内全国小学基本上实现五年一贯制。由于广大工农群众的子女迫切要求入学，公办小学虽逐年增设，在目前还难以完全满足人民的要求，因此，今后小学以公办为主，但在群众真正自愿的基础上设立民办小学是应该允许的，政府必须加强领导与帮助，使其能坚持下来。
    会议根据以上问题分组进行了深入的研究讨论，各地代表提出了发展中小学教育工作中存在的困难，这些困难，经过讨论，都基本上获得了解决。会议最后通过了：“关于解决一九五二年暑假后中等学校师资问题的决定”，“关于小学实施五年一贯制的指示”，“关于整顿和发展民办小学的指示”，和“关于吸收失业知识分子培养师资的训练计划”等项草案。这些决定和计划报上级批准后实施。会议期间，代表们广泛地交换了解决中小学校舍、师资问题和在职教师进修的经验，举行了经验交流大会。代表们在会上听取了“河北省沙河县农村小学教师业余学校的经验”、“河南省教师星期进修学校的经验”、“天津市关于提高在职教师和改造知识分子的经验”、“山东省几年来在中小学发展中解决师资问题的情况”、“东北区实行二部制的经验”、和“北京市实验五年一贯制小学报告”等典型经验的报告。
    中央教育部钱俊瑞副部长在闭幕会上作了“为提高教学质量，以满足广大人民的需要，为祖国培养合格的建设人才而斗争”的总结报告。他强调地指出：为了配合国家大规模的经济建设，将进行大规模的教育建设，在今后几年内，要培养几十万的高级建设人才，数以百万计的中级建设人才并须争取百分之八十以上的学龄儿童入学。摆在全国教育工作者面前的中心问题是如何不断提高教学质量的问题。教师的思想改造是提高教学质量的关键，各级学校的教师们应继续进行自我教育和自我改造，并着手有系统地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想；在有条件的学校，应即有准备地建立政治工作，以求不断地提高师生员工的政治思想水平。各地应参照天津、河北省的沙河、哈尔滨和河南等地的经验，建立教师们经常的系统的业余学习制度，特别是设立自学、讲授和函授相结合的业余进修学校。关于小学实施五年一贯制问题，钱副部长着重指出，五年制小学的实施是为了保证劳动人民的子女受到完全的初等教育，我们应用最大努力在今后三年内培养和提高小学教师，争取在三年后有足够的教师能够胜任新学制小学四五年级的教学任务。关于民办小学，他强调必须采取积极方针，并坚持下列原则：群众完全自愿，不许强迫；群众有正当的可靠的出钱出力的办法，能维持一定年限；经乡人民代表会议通过，县人民政府批准。在发展中学问题上，他要求大力推广二部制，提拔优秀小学教师和吸收训练失业知识分子担任中学教师，坚持教师业余学习。钱副部长并号召各地教育工作者有计划地培养典型，推广先进经验，选择重点组织教师展开改进教学的竞赛运动，组织模范教师会议，优秀教育工作者会议，以总结和传播先进经验，使提高教学质量的工作成为全国教师的群众性运动，这样才能满足广大人民的需要，为祖国培养各级各类合格的建设人才。
