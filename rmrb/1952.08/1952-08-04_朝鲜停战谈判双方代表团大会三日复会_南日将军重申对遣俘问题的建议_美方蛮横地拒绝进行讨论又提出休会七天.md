Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 3rd: At the plenary session of the Korean Armistice Talks delegations on the 3rd, our chief representative, General Nam Il, strongly condemned the other side for unilaterally adjourning the meeting for seven days on July 26, deliberately delaying the armistice negotiations, and massacring our captured personnel during the unilateral adjournment. General Nam Il pointed out that the other side's unreasonable actions of evading the meeting could not force our side to accept its unilateral and unreasonable demands, nor could it absolve the other side of its responsibility for persecuting and massacring prisoners of war. The issue of prisoner of war repatriation must be resolved through consultations between the two sides on a reasonable basis in accordance with the Geneva Convention. However, the other side's chief representative, Harrison, refused to conduct any discussions on the prisoner of war issue and once again proposed a seven-day recess until August 11. General Nam Il sternly pointed out that time would tell the other side that its unreasonable actions were completely unhelpful in resolving the problem. However, since the other side requested a seven-day recess, our side could also agree. But if the other side wants to solve the problem, it must fundamentally abandon its rude attitude of refusing to meet and refusing to negotiate, and honestly sit at the negotiating table to negotiate in the spirit of reason. General Nam Il's main speech was as follows:

"Currently, the only issue hindering the Korean armistice is the prisoner of war issue. Peace-loving people all over the world are watching every action of the two delegations in the armistice negotiations, demanding that the two sides quickly reach an agreement on a reasonable basis in accordance with the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War and achieve a Korean armistice. However, disregarding the aspirations of the people of the world and our repeated efforts, your side has abandoned its willingness to seek a solution that is reasonably suitable to the requirements of both sides at the administrative meeting of the two delegations, and refused to conduct discussions. Your side even dares not to make public the records of the administrative meeting to this day. On the first day of the resumption of the open meeting of the two delegations on July 26, your side once again unilaterally adjourned the meeting for seven days without any reason, and left the meeting halfway. During your side's unilateral adjournment, your side once again barbarously massacred our captured personnel. Your side is attempting to use the method of evading the meeting to insist on your claim to detain prisoners of war in complete violation of the Geneva Convention, and to carry out your cowardly and barbaric acts of massacring prisoners of war. I want to tell you once again that any of your rude and unreasonable actions cannot force our side to accept your unilateral and unreasonable demands, nor can it absolve you of your responsibility for persecuting and massacring prisoners of war, but only more blatantly expose your side's face of delaying and even sabotaging the armistice negotiations. If your so-called sincerity in achieving a Korean armistice, your so-called seeking of a solution suitable to the requirements of both sides, is not a thorough hypocrisy and lie, you must honestly sit down and negotiate. The issue of prisoner of war repatriation must be resolved reasonably in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War and in accordance with the principles already agreed upon by both sides. According to the Geneva Convention and the principle of repatriating prisoners of war home to live a peaceful life in Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement, which have been agreed upon by both parties. Our side suggests that prisoners of war of both sides be reclassified according to nationality and region, and that the prisoner of war lists exchanged by both sides on December 18, 1951, be re-corrected accordingly. Only Korean prisoners of war who live in the area held by the receiving party may be allowed to return home on the spot without being repatriated. All foreign prisoners of war held by both sides must be repatriated. The number of prisoners of war that your side should repatriate should by no means be close to 70,000, but should be close to the number of 116,000 that your side admits, including 20,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. As long as the list re-corrected by your side is close to the number of 116,000, including 20,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, the prisoner of war issue can be resolved. At present, most of the textual details of the draft armistice agreement have been agreed upon, and all agreements can be reached soon. The Korean armistice is at hand, and your side has no reason to refuse to agree to our side's reasonable compromise plan of re-correcting the prisoner of war list on July 18 to realize the Korean armistice desired by the people of the world." The meeting of staff officers of both sides continued to discuss the textual details of the draft armistice agreement on August 3.

    朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会三日复会
    南日将军重申对遣俘问题的建议
    美方蛮横地拒绝进行讨论又提出休会七天
    【新华社开城三日电】三日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军痛斥对方在七月二十六日片面休会七天，蓄意拖延停战谈判，并在片面休会期间屠杀我方被俘人员。南日将军指出：对方这种逃会的无理行动，绝不能强使我方接受其片面无理主张，更不能解脱对方迫害与屠杀战俘的责任。战俘遣返问题必须根据日内瓦公约，在合理的基础上，经由双方协商求得解决。但对方首席代表哈利逊对于遣俘问题拒绝进行任何讨论，却又一次提出休会七天到八月十一日。南日将军严词指出：时间会告诉对方，对方这种无理行动完全无助于问题的解决。但对方既然要求休会七天，我方亦可同意。但如果对方要解决问题，对方就必须根本放弃这种拒绝开会、拒绝协商的蛮横态度，老老实实地坐在会议桌上根据说理的精神进行谈判。南日将军主要发言如下：
    “目前阻碍着朝鲜停战的只有一个遣俘问题。全世界爱好和平的人民都注视着停战谈判中双方代表团的每一行动，要求双方根据日内瓦战俘公约在合理的基础上迅速达成协议，实现朝鲜停战。但你方不顾世界人民的热望，不顾我方一再的努力，在双方代表团大会行政性会议上，背弃了你方愿意寻求在合理程度上适合双方要求的解决方案的表示，拒绝进行讨论。你方甚至于至今不敢公开行政性会议的记录。在七月二十六日双方代表团大会恢复公开会议的第一天，你方就再次毫无理由地片面休会七天，中途逃离会场。在你方片面休会期间，你方又一次野蛮地屠杀我方被俘人员。你方企图用逃会的办法，来坚持你方彻底违反日内瓦公约的扣留战俘的主张，进行你方屠杀战俘的卑怯野蛮行为。我要再一次告诉你，你方任何横蛮无理的行动都不能强使我方接受你方片面无理的主张，更不能解脱你方迫害与屠杀战俘的责任，而只是更加露骨地暴露出你方拖延乃至破坏停战谈判的面目。如果你方所谓达成朝鲜停战的诚意，所谓寻求适合双方要求的解决方案，不是彻头彻尾的虚伪谎言，你方就必须老老实实地坐下来进行谈判。战俘遣返问题必须根据日内瓦战俘公约的规定，按照双方已经协议的原则求得合理的解决。根据日内瓦公约和停战协定草案中双方已经同意的第五十一款和第五十二款遣返战俘回家过和平生活的原则。我方建议双方战俘按照国籍和地区重新分类，并据此重新校正一九五一年十二月十八日双方交换的战俘名单，朝鲜籍战俘中只有家住收容一方地区者，可以许其就地回家，不必遣返，双方收容下的外国籍战俘必须全部遣返。你方应予遣返的战俘数字决不应接近于七万，而应该接近于你方所承认的十一万六千的数字，包括两万名中国人民志愿军战俘在内。只要你方重新校正的名单接近于十一万六千的数字，包括两万名中国人民志愿军战俘在内，遣俘问题即可解决。目前停战协定草案的文字细节绝大部分已经取得了协议，并不久即可取得全部的协议，朝鲜停战举手可及，你方更没有任何理由拒绝同意我方七月十八日重新校正战俘名单的合理折衷方案，实现世界人民所渴望的朝鲜停战。”双方参谋人员会议在八月三日继续讨论停战协定草案的文字细节问题。
