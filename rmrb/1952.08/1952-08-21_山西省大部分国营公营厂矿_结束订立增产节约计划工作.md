Most state-owned and public factories and mines in Shanxi Province have concluded the work of mobilizing the masses to formulate production increase and economy plans and competition plans at the workshop, team, and individual levels. Currently, they have begun to enter a stage centered on improving quality, implementing technical reforms, and promoting advanced experiences. Based on the planning situation of various factories and mines, they can be roughly divided into three categories:

The first category is: the masses were mobilized relatively fully, the plans formulated were practical and reliable, and also relatively advanced; and they have already achieved great results in the competition. There are not many factories and mines in this category. Their prominent feature is that the planning is combined with production reform and technical management reform, so the plans are relatively advanced and have specific technical measures, solving problems existing in equipment, operating techniques, safety production, and mutual cooperation between departments.

The second category is: although the plans have been discussed by the masses, there are no specific measures to implement the plans; the masses have also found "tips," but they cannot focus on solving the main problems, and the reliability of these tips is unknown since they have not been tested. Therefore, the problems existing in the plans are exposed shortly after the movement starts. This type of factory and mine accounts for the majority of factories and mines in the province. For example, in the Jinhua Textile Factory, from the factory director to every employee, personal plans were made, and relatively serious discussions were conducted, exposing and criticizing some past wrong ideas, and summarizing some advanced experiences. However, the factory conducted a check on the implementation of the plan on July 12 and found that almost none of the 106 teams in the spinning workshop had properly implemented the Hao Jianxiu work method, and the average roller lapping rate was 49.5 percentage points higher than the planned target. The situation in the weaving workshop was exactly the opposite. Originally, the leadership only required the unit output to reach 34.2 yards between July and August, but as soon as the movement started, it had already reached an average of 34.64 yards. The plan lagged far behind the actual output.

The third category is: factories with slow movement development. The masses in this type of factory and mine are not fully mobilized, the leading cadres do not go deep, and they cannot grasp the key problems. For example, the planned targets set by the Jinsheng Textile Factory were very conservative. After being criticized by the higher-level leading organs, they blindly mobilized the masses to "find tips," found more than 100 "tips," but still could not solve the key problems, resulting in the roller lapping rate rising from 12 pounds to 20 pounds, the front roller speed decreasing, the yarn breakage rate increasing, and the output decreasing by 100 pounds per shift in late July. Another example is the Taiyuan Paper Mill, which did not grasp the key problems, and the discussion of the plan yielded no results after 18 days. The leadership of the Yangquan Mining Bureau had a sense of complacency, believing that the previously proposed indicators were about to be completed, satisfied with the existing achievements, and many opinions put forward by the workers in the plan were not resolved, resulting in low morale.

Regardless of whether they are relatively advanced or backward factories and mines, there are two common shortcomings: 1. The planned targets originally proposed by the leadership generally showed more or less conservatism, and some were even behind the current production level. For example, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant originally proposed to increase production and save 400 billion yuan, but the leadership changed it to 350 billion yuan to leave some room, but after discussion by the masses, it can now reach about 500 billion yuan. The Ximing Coking Plant's coal consumption for coke in June this year has been reduced to 1.8 tons, but the savings target set by the leadership requires 2.5 tons, which is 0.7 tons higher than the actual consumption.

2. Although the staff have participated in the competition, it is still far from meeting the requirements of production reform. Except for the promotion of the rapid settlement method by the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, there are very few advanced plans in the management departments' competition plans. The reason for this situation is mainly because the leading cadres are unfamiliar with management business and do not know what to grasp. The director of the Taiyuan No. 2 Power Plant said: "For the management department, we can only propose facing production or serving production, but we can't put forward how to do it specifically." Therefore, in the process of formulating plans, not enough attention is paid to how to accelerate capital turnover and save basic construction funds.

Based on the above situation, the Shanxi Provincial Patriotic Production Increase and Economy Competition Movement Committee has decided: At present, the work of formulating plans will be basically concluded, and the responsibilities of the trade union and the administration will be clarified in the form of collective contracts. In the third quarter, the focus will be on improving quality, implementing technical reforms, and promoting advanced experiences.

    山西省大部分国营公营厂矿
    结束订立增产节约计划工作
    山西省大部分国营、公营厂矿，发动群众订立车间、小组以及个人增产节约计划和竞赛计划的工作，已经结束。目前已经开始进入以提高质量，贯彻技术改革，推广先进经验为中心的阶段。综合各厂矿订计划的情况，大体可以分为三类：
    第一类是：群众发动得比较充分，计划订的实际可靠，也比较先进；而且已经在竞赛中收到巨大的成绩。这类厂矿不多，其突出的特点是：订计划时结合生产改革和技术管理改革，因而计划比较先进，且有具体技术措施，解决了在设备、操作技术、安全生产、各部门相互配合等方面存在的问题。
    第二类是：计划虽然经过了群众的讨论，但没有实现计划的具体措施；群众也找了“窍门”，但不能集中地解决主要问题，而且这些窍门又没有经过实验，可靠的程度怎样？还不知道。因此运动开展不久，计划中所存在的问题就暴露出来了。这类厂矿占全省厂矿的多数。例如晋华纺织厂，从厂长到每个职工都订了个人计划，也曾进行了比较认真的讨论，揭发并批判了过去的一些错误思想，总结了一些先进经验。但该厂七月十二日进行了一次计划执行的检查，发现细纱车间一百零六个小组几乎都没有很好地实行郝建秀工作法，皮辊花率平均高出计划指标的百分之四十九点五。织布车间的情况恰恰相反，原来领导方面只要求七月到八月间，单位产量达到三十四点二码，但运动刚一开始，就已平均达到三十四点六四码。计划远远落在实际产量的后面。
    第三类是：运动发展迟缓的厂子。这类厂矿的群众发动得极不充分，领导干部不深入，抓不住关键问题。例如晋生纺织厂订的计划指标很保守，受到上级领导机关批评以后，又盲目地发动群众“找窍门”，找出一百多个“窍门”，仍不能解决关键问题，以致皮辊花率由十二磅上升到二十磅，前罗拉转数减少，断头率增加，七月下旬每班少产一百磅纱。又如太原造纸厂没抓着关键问题，讨论计划十八天没有结果。阳泉矿务局的领导方面存在着自满情绪，认为以前提出的指标，快完成了，满足于现有的成绩，工人在计划中提出的许多意见都没有得到解决，因而情绪低落。
    不管是比较先进的，还是落后的厂矿，都有两个共同的缺点：一、领导方面原来提出来的计划指标，一般都表现了或多或少的保守性，有的甚至落后于目前的生产水平。如太原钢铁厂原来提出增产节约四千亿元，领导方面为留些余地改成三千五百亿元，经群众讨论现在可达五千亿元左右。西铭焦炭厂，今年六月份的焦炭耗煤量已降低到一点八吨，但领导方面制订的节约指标却要求二点五吨，比实际消耗量还高出零点七吨。
    二、职员虽然都参加了竞赛，但按照生产改革来要求，还差得很远。管理部门的竞赛计划，除太原钢铁厂推行快速结账法外，还很少有一个先进的计划。形成这种情况的原因，主要是由于领导干部对管理业务生疏，不知该抓什么。太原发电二厂的厂长说：“对管理部门，只能提出面向生产或为生产服务，至于具体该怎样做就提不出来了。”因此，在订计划中，对于如何加速资金周转和节约基本建设资金，都普遍地注意不够。
    根据以上情况，山西省爱国增产节约竞赛运动委员会已决定：目前大体上把订计划工作结束，并以集体合同方式把工会与行政的职责明确起来。第三季内将以提高质量，贯彻技术改革，推广先进经验为中心。
