Send Telegrams to Comfort the Wounded and Sick Soldiers and Medical Workers in the Armed Forces
The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Medical Workers' Union Working Committee, the Red Cross Society of China, the Chinese Medical Association, and the Chinese Nurses Association jointly sent telegrams to comfort the wounded and sick soldiers and medical workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day. The telegram is as follows:
Dear wounded and sick comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
Dear medical workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
On the "August 1st" Army Day, this day of great historical significance, we extend to you our most lofty respect and most sincere greetings.
Dear wounded and sick comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in the struggle to liberate the Chinese people and on the front lines of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, you have carried forward the traditional spirit of hard struggle and courage of the Chinese People's Army, liberated the Chinese people, and severely打击ed the arrogant arrogance of the U.S. aggressors on the Korean front, forcing the gang of robbers headed by the United States to accept peace talks due to repeated setbacks and internal chaos. Your immortal achievements have supported the liberation struggle of the Korean people; guaranteed the smooth progress of the motherland's construction undertakings; and defended the cause of peace that all good people in the world are eagerly seeking! You have gloriously sustained injuries for these causes, and these scars are deeply engraved in the hearts of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people. Your heroic deeds are spread throughout the motherland, radiating brilliance, illuminating and educating everyone; everyone will build the motherland with greater confidence. However, the U.S. imperialism is unwilling to fail. Their recent狂轰滥炸 proves that their ambition to expand the war has not died. Therefore, in order to achieve peace, we must redouble our vigilance and give them heavier and more fatal blows. Comrades! Rest assured and recuperate, we extend to you our most sincere greetings.
Comrades, medical workers working in the Chinese People's Liberation Army and on the front lines of aiding Korea, you spare no effort to rescue every soldier wounded in defending peace, guarding the wounded and sick day and night. For "our most beloved people," you unhesitatingly dedicated all your skills, wisdom, and energy, even your blood! You have fully developed the great "revolutionary humanitarian spirit" that the great Chairman Mao called on our medical workers to possess. Because of your work, you have inspired the fighting spirit of the soldiers, guaranteed the victory of peace, and crushed the bacteriological warfare launched by the U.S. aggressors in Korea in violation of international law and humanitarianism! You are the model for medical workers in the new China, and your glorious deeds deeply educate us.
Dear comrades, your merits will forever shine in the annals of mankind's defense of peace.
In addition to expressing our heartfelt respect and greetings to you on this great festival, all of us medical workers also guarantee to learn from your spirit, strengthen our studies, transform our thinking, and improve our political and technical levels; we guarantee to do a good job in the patriotic health campaign, improve the health level of the people across the country, so that the people across the country can devote themselves to various construction undertakings with a happy mood and a healthy body, and better build our great motherland.

    亲爱的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军伤病员同志们：
    亲爱的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军医务工作者同志们：
    在“八一”建军节，这一具有伟大历史意义的节日，我们特向你们致以最崇高的敬意和最恳挚的慰问。
    亲爱的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军伤病员同志们，你们在解放中国人民的斗争中和在抗美援朝的前线，发扬了中国人民军队的艰苦奋斗、勇往直前的传统精神，使中国人民得到了解放，在朝鲜前线更沉重地打击了美国侵略者狂妄嚣张的气焰，迫使以美国为首的强盗集团因屡遭挫败、内部混乱，而不得不接受和谈。你们的不朽战绩，支援了朝鲜人民的解放斗争；保障了祖国各项建设事业的顺利进行；保卫了全世界善良人民所迫切企求的和平事业！你们为这些事业光荣的负了伤，这个伤痕深深铭刻在亿万和平人民的心上。你们的英勇事迹流传在祖国各个地方，放射出光辉，照耀与教育着每一个人；每一个人都将以更大的信心来建设祖国。但美帝国主义是不甘失败的，最近它们的狂轰滥炸，证明它们扩大战争的野心依然未死。因此我们为了实现和平，必须加倍提高警惕，给它们以更沉重、更致命的打击。同志们！你们安心休养吧，我们特向你们致最恳挚的慰问。
    工作在中国人民解放军和在援朝前线的医务工作者同志们，你们不避一切艰苦抢救着每一个为保卫和平而负伤的战士，日以继夜地守护在伤病员身边。为了“我们最可爱的人”，你们毫不迟疑地献出了所有的技术、智慧与精力，甚至你们的热血！你们充分发扬了伟大的毛主席号召我们医务工作者所应具备的“革命人道主义精神”。由于你们的工作，鼓舞了战士的斗志，保障了和平的胜利，并且打垮了美国侵略者在朝鲜所发动的违犯国际公法和人道主义的细菌战争！你们是新中国医务工作者的榜样，你们的光荣事迹深切地教育着我们。
    亲爱的同志们，你们的功绩将在人类保卫和平的史页上永远发光。
    我们全体医务工作者，除了在这伟大的节日向你们致以衷心的敬意与慰问外，并且保证学习你们的精神，加强学习，改造思想，提高政治和技术水平；保证搞好爱国卫生运动，提高全国人民的健康水平，使全国人民都能以愉快的心情和健康的身体投身到各项建设事业之中，更好的建设我们伟大的祖国。    （新华社）
