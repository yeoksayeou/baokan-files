    Propagandists Should Practice What They Preach
    To the Editor: Subsidiary production in Shuipo Village, Fifth District, Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province (totaling 178 households, 706 people) is very developed. Subsidiary production mainly consists of raising livestock. Currently, the village raises 103 pigs, 1,127 sheep, and 1,294 chickens. These numbers exceed the planned livestock raising figures for this spring by 29% to 42%. It is estimated that these three types of livestock can be sold for more than 50,000 jin of rice by the end of the year, and the accumulated fertilizer will be sufficient for more than 1,100 mu of land.
    The success of subsidiary production in this village is inseparable from the work of the village propagandists Zhao Chunhua, Li Liangtang, and others (ten people in total). In the past, some propagandists only talked and didn't act, and the masses had a very bad impression of them. The village branch of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting of propagandists, led the propagandists to review their past work, and decided that in the future they should practice what they preach, lead the masses by example, and implement a "contracted propaganda" system. The propagandists changed their past style of only talking and not acting, mobilized the whole village to raise livestock, and achieved the above-mentioned results.

    宣传员应该说到做到
    编辑同志：山西左权县五区水坡村（共一百七十八户，七百零六人）的副业生产很发达。副业生产主要是喂养家畜。目前全村喂养了一百零三口猪，一千一百二十七只羊，一千二百九十四只鸡。这些数字超过今春计划喂养数字的百分之二十九到四十二。估计这三项家畜到年底能卖五万多斤米，所积肥料足供一千一百多亩田使用。
    这村副业生产搞得好，是和村的宣传员赵春花、李良堂等十人的工作分不开的。过去某些宣传员光说不做，群众对他们的印象很不好。中共村支部开了宣传员会议，领导宣传员检讨了过去的工作，决定今后要说到做到，以身作则地推动群众，并且要实行“包干宣传”的制度。宣传员改变了过去光说不做的作风，发动全村喂养家畜，做出了上述的成绩。　福升　秀林　俊林　庆祥  珍元　振华　春义
