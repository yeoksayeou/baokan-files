Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st -- With the administrative meeting ending in failure due to the US side's refusal to negotiate, bringing the armistice talks to an unprecedentedly serious deadlock, Van Fleet, commander of the US Eighth Army in Korea, shamelessly clamored again in Seoul on July 30: "The chance of a ceasefire is directly proportional to the amount of military pressure applied to the enemy."

Figures here reviewed the repeated failures of the US side's so-called "military pressure" during the thirteen months of negotiations, pointing out that the American generals, who had suffered heavy losses on the battlefield, knew very well that the so-called "military pressure" could not shake our firm position. Therefore, echoed by the reactionary American newspapers, they clamored for "applying military pressure to obtain a ceasefire," attempting to create a war atmosphere so that the US government could prepare for greater military adventures and undermine the armistice negotiations. At this time last year, US representative Joy was insisting on a military demarcation line that penetrated 12,000 square kilometers into our positions. In order to coerce our side into accepting its unreasonable demands, the American aggressors brazenly carried out their "military pressure." On the one hand, they sent aircraft to bomb the residence of our delegation, forcing the negotiations to be suspended from August 23. On the other hand, Van Fleet launched the so-called "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive." However, during the period from August 22 to October 25, when the US side was forced to resume negotiations, the "United Nations forces" suffered nearly 150,000 casualties, including about 75,000 American troops, and gained nothing on the battlefield. Therefore, at the resumed negotiations in Panmunjom, the US side had to abandon its delusion of seizing 12,000 square kilometers of land and finally accepted the solution of using the actual contact line as the military demarcation line. According to this plan, our side retained approximately equal land area south of the 38th parallel as the US side north of the 38th parallel.

However, the American aggressors did not learn enough lessons from this. At that time, Joy repeatedly boasted: "Ruthless military pressure is the stimulus for a rapid agreement on other agenda items." During the lengthy discussions on the third and fourth agenda items, the US side attempted to impose unilateral demands on our side on every issue. At the same time, they did indeed spare no expense to continuously carry out the so-called "military pressure" outside the meetings. The result was: from June 26 last year to June 15 this year, the "United Nations forces" suffered 325,000 casualties, including about 130,000 American troops, and damaged more than 5,900 aircraft. Even the head of the Fifth Air Force had to admit that the so-called "strangulation warfare" and "focus strike warfare" in the air had not achieved their goals, and at the same time, the ground front had changed very little. This ruthless fact forced the US side to abandon its original unilateral demands in the negotiations and accept solutions that could satisfy both sides. The most significant of these was the demand to interfere in internal affairs by restricting the construction of airfields, which the US side had to abandon after insisting on it for more than five months.

At this time this year, only the issue of prisoner repatriation remains in the negotiations, but the US side is still trying to force our side to accept their unilateral demand to detain 20 percent of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war and 68 percent of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. In the administrative meetings, they went back on their promise to seek a "solution that reasonably meets the requirements of both parties." On the one hand, they want to use absenteeism and other shameless means to completely interrupt the negotiations. On the other hand, under the name of "military pressure," they have carried out large-scale indiscriminate bombings and blatant provocations of invading our country's airspace and territorial waters, attempting to prepare for expanding the war. However, the situation in August this year is even more different than in August last year. Even the American aggressors themselves have to admit that the strength of the Korean and Chinese People's armies has been greatly enhanced. The "New York Times," which often represents official American opinion, expressed support for Van Fleet's "military pressure" theory in its editorial on July 31, but then added: "Because the enemy has strengthened his forces, this pressure is now limited." The fact is: in the increasingly frequent incursions, the US military is suffering greater and greater casualties. US military casualties totaled 5,361 in May, surged to 11,220 in June, and suffered severe blows in many battles in July.

Obviously, the development of the situation will not simply be a repetition of last year. If the American aggressors want to engage in "military pressure" today, they will only crush themselves and encounter an even more disgraceful defeat than in the past. If the American aggressors want to spread the flames of the Korean War, they will burn themselves in even fiercer flames.

    开城人士评范佛里特的无耻叫嚣
    指出美国所谓“军事压力”早已彻底破产
    【新华社开城一日电】由于美方代表拒绝协商而使行政性会议归于失败，使停战谈判陷入空前严重僵局的时候，侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特七月三十日又在汉城露骨地叫嚣：“停战的机会与加予敌人军事压力的分量成正比例。”
    此间人士回顾了十三个月谈判过程中美方所谓“军事压力”的一再破产，指出：在战场上碰得头破血流的美国将军们，深知所谓“军事压力”绝不能动摇我方的坚定立场。因此，他们在美国反动报刊的应合下，喧嚷“施用军事压力，才能获得停战”，企图借此制造战争空气，以便美国政府准备进行更大的军事冒险并破坏停战谈判。去年此时，美方代表乔埃正在坚持一条深入我方阵地一万二千平方公里的军事分界线。为了胁迫我方接受其无理强求，美国侵略者悍然进行了他们的“军事压力”。一方面，派遣飞机轰炸我方代表团驻地，迫使谈判自八月二十三日起停顿，另一方面范佛里特发动了所谓“夏季攻势”与“秋季攻势”。但是自八月二十二到十月二十五日美方被迫恢复谈判的这一段时期中，“联合国军”除了遭受包括约七万五千名美国部队的近十五万人伤亡外，战场上一无所得。因而，在板门店恢复的谈判会议上，美方不得不放弃其夺取一万二千平方公里土地的妄想，最后接受了以实际接触线为军事分界线的解决方案。按照这个方案，我方在三八线南与美方在三八线北各保有大约相等的土地面积。
    但是，美国侵略者并未从此中获得足够的经验教训。当时乔埃曾一再吹嘘：“无情的军事压力是促成对其它议程项目迅速获得协议的刺激物。”在其从第三项及第四项议程的冗长讨论中，美方在每一个问题上都曾企图把片面主张强加于我方。同时，他们在会外也的确不计血本地不断进行了所谓“军事压力”。结果是：自去年六月二十六日至今年六月十五日这一段时期内，“联合国军”遭受了包括约十三万美国部队的三十二万五千名伤亡，损伤了五千九百多架飞机，连第五航空队的首脑也不得不承认空中的所谓“绞杀战”与“重点突击战”并未达到目的，同时地面战线也很少变化。这一个无情的事实，迫使美方在谈判中放弃原来的片面强求，来接受可使双方满意的解决办法。其中最显著的是限制修建机场的干涉内政要求，美方在坚持了五个多月之后，最后也不得不表示放弃。
    今年此时，谈判中已经只剩下遣俘一个问题，而美方却仍企图迫使我方接受他们扣留百分之二十朝鲜人民军被俘人员和百分之六十八志愿军被俘人员的片面要求。他们在行政性会议上背弃了自己声称愿意寻求一个“在合理程度上适合双方要求的解决方案”的诺言。他们一方面想用逃会及其他无耻手段，使谈判完全中断，另一方面在“军事压力”的名义下进行了大规模的狂轰滥炸及明目张胆侵犯我国领空、领海的挑衅行为，企图准备扩大战争。但是，今年八月和去年八月的情况更不相同了。连美国侵略者自己也不得不承认朝中人民军队的力量已更大大增强。经常代表美国官方意见的“纽约时报”在七月三十一日的社论里表示拥护范佛里特的“军事压力”论后，紧接着说：“因为敌人已经加强了他的力量，这种压力现在是有限了。”事实是：在日愈频繁的窜犯中，美军正遭受着愈来愈大的杀伤，五月美军伤亡共五千三百六十一人，六月激增至一万一千二百二十人，七月的许多战斗中，美军也遭受到严重的打击。
    显然，局势的发展将不仅是去年的简单重复。美国侵略者今天要搞“军事压力”，只会压碎他们自己，而遭遇比过去更可耻的失败。美国侵略者若要蔓延朝鲜战火，他们就将在更烈的火焰中自焚。
