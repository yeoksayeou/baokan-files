To the Editor:

    Near Beidayang Village, Third District, Xiong County, Hebei Province, there is a five- or six-mu graveyard wasteland. In the past, it was covered with thorns and weeds. Sun Keming, an eighty-year-old farmer in this village, felt it was a pity to see this land abandoned, so this year he rented it from his clan to cultivate. He planted corn, peanuts, cotton, eggplants, and other crops in this field, and they are now growing luxuriantly. The corn is more than ten feet tall, with ears two feet long, and the eggplants weigh two or three pounds each. People say the crops are growing well, and he is using this fact to break the superstitious beliefs in feng shui and ghosts and gods held by many farmers.

    八十岁老农民孙克明把荒坟地开垦成良田
    编辑同志：河北雄县三区北大阳村附近有一块五、六亩大的坟滩地，过去长满了荆棘和野草，这村里八十岁的老农民孙克明看见这块地荒了可惜，就在今年向族里租下了来耕种。他在这块地里种上了玉米、花生、棉花、茄子等各种作物，现在都长得茂盛。玉米长得有一丈多高，穗子有二尺来长，茄子一个有二、三斤重。人们都说庄稼长得好，他用这种事实打破了许多农民信风水鬼神的迷信思想。
