Volunteer Army Air Force fighters had been eagerly awaiting the day they could drop bombs on the enemy, and that day had finally arrived!

On a freezing night of minus ten degrees, in the waiting room of a frontline field airport, Volunteer Army pilots were awaiting deployment – a night raid on the enemy entrenched on ×× Island and enemy gunboats on the sea, to coordinate with ground forces in liberating the island. I heard them excitedly discussing this battle: "The moment has come. Let's put our oath into practice and resolutely drop the bombs accurately on the targets!"

Time ticked by, and telegrams urgently conveyed orders.

In an instant, people were busy preparing for takeoff at the airport. The cold wind whipped at countless faces flushed with excitement.

"For the motherland, for peace, for the Korean people, let's repay the enemy with our bombs! Comrades, remember your oath, fight bravely!" The unit leader issued the final order, encouraging the departing soldiers.

"Resolutely complete the glorious combat mission!" the brave men answered loudly.

The roar of the engines shattered the silence of the cold night. The commander issued the takeoff order, and green signal flares indicating takeoff rose one by one into the night sky. The brave men took to the air in their planes, flying in neat formation towards the enemy's nest. They flew over the peaceful towns of Korea, destroyed by American aerial bandits. There, orphans who had lost their parents, mothers who had lost their children, and homeless peaceful residents were waiting for the Chinese and Korean People's Air Force fighters to retaliate fiercely against the American aggressors who had destroyed their happy lives.

"Look down there!" the lead plane's communicator excitedly notified all personnel.

Below, on our army's positions, artillery was fiercely spitting fire at the enemy, and tracer bullets were guiding our air force. A large fire was burning fiercely on the enemy's positions.

The enemy's nest was ahead. The squadron advanced in the night sky.

"Entering target!" the lead plane's navigator, Comrade Zhang Zhizhi, informed his comrades.

Pilot Yao Changchuan skillfully maneuvered the plane, preparing for battle. He was thinking about how to steer the plane more accurately into the target area so that he could drop the bombs more accurately.

"Reached designated target!" Navigator Zhang Zhizhi said.

"Drop bombs!" Pilot Yao Changchuan replied.

With that, groups of flares were already swaying in the air below, illuminating the sea and the island in red. The battle began.

The flares indicated the targets for the following planes. The navigators were all focused on the sights, carefully searching for enemy ships and fortifications on the island, and calmly correcting the distance and direction.

Tons and tons of avenging steel were poured down on the enemy on the sea and on the island. Flames burst and splashed on the ground and water, dust and smoke rolled, and waves surged.

After Yao Changchuan led his team of planes to drop their bombs, Wang Enze led another team to fly over the target. The American bandits, who had committed heinous crimes in Korea, were receiving punishment from our army simultaneously from the air and from the land.

    志愿军空军夜炸敌巢
    新兵
    志愿军空军战士们日日夜夜盼望着将炸弹投到敌人头上的日子终于来临了！
    一个零下十度的寒夜，在前线野战机场的休息室里，志愿军飞行人员正在等待着出征——夜袭盘踞在××岛的敌人和海面敌炮舰，配合地面部队解放该岛。我听到他们在兴奋地谈着这次战斗：“时刻到了。实践自己的誓言吧，坚决把炸弹准准地投到目标上！”
    时间一分一秒地过去，电报急促地传达着命令。
    顷刻间，人们已在机场上忙碌地准备着起飞的工作。冷风吹打着无数兴奋得发烧的脸。
    “为了祖国，为了和平，为了朝鲜人民，用我们的炸弹回敬敌人吧！同志们，记着你们的誓言，勇敢地战斗吧！”部队首长下达了最后的命令，鼓舞着出征的战士们。
    “坚决完成光荣的战斗任务！”勇士们高声回答。
    发动机的巨响，震破了寒夜的沉寂。指挥员下达了起飞的命令，表示起飞的绿色信号弹一颗一颗地升入夜空。勇士们驾机凌空，以整齐的队形，向敌巢飞去。他们飞过被美国空中强盗炸毁的朝鲜的和平城镇。那里，失去父母的孤儿、失去孩子的母亲、无家可归的和平居民，正期待着中朝人民空军战士狠狠地还击毁灭他们幸福生活的美国侵略者。
    “看下面！”长机通讯员惊喜地通知全机人员。
    在下面我军的阵地上，大炮正狠狠地向敌人喷吐着火舌，曳光弹替我空军指示着方向。敌人阵地上大火正在炽烈的燃烧。
    敌巢就在前面。机群在夜空里前进着。
    “进入目标！”长机领航员张执之同志通知同机的战友。
    飞行员姚长川同志娴熟地操纵着飞机，准备着战斗。他考虑着怎样才能把飞机更准确地驶入目标区，好把炸弹投得更准确些。
    “到达指定目标了！”领航员张执之说。
    “投弹！”飞行员姚长川回答。
    说罢，一组一组的照明弹已摇荡在机下半空，映红了海面和岛屿。战斗开始了。
    照明弹给后面的飞机指示了目标。领航员们个个全神贯注在瞄准具上，仔细地寻找着敌人舰艇和海岛上的工事，并从容地校正着距离和方位。
    一吨吨复仇的钢铁，向着海洋上、海岛上的敌人倾泻下去。火焰在地上、水面上爆裂迸溅，尘土和烟火滚动着，波澜起伏着。
    姚长川率领的一队飞机投完弹后，王恩泽率领的一队又飞临目标上空了。在朝鲜干下滔天罪行的美国强盗们，在这里受到了我军从空中、从陆上同时给予的惩罚。
