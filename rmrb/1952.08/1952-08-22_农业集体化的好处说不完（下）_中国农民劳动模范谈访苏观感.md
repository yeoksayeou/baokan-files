The benefits of agricultural collectivization are endless (Part 2)
——Chinese model farmers discuss impressions of Soviet visit

The agricultural woman model worker from Heilongjiang, Guo Yulan, said:

"What impressed us the most was that collectivization and mechanization enabled Soviet rural women to participate extensively in production. We saw that large wheat fields of collective farms did not require many people, and harvesting only required a combine harvester and a few women. In various farming processes, the number of women participating in work was no less than that of men. In Ukraine, we met Angelina, the first female tractor driver in the Soviet Union. Collective farms develop animal husbandry, allowing more women to work. Every collective farm has nurseries. Women not only have maternity leave before and after childbirth, but also receive 50% to 100% of their daily wage during maternity leave. I think, after China's agriculture is collectivized and mechanized in the future, won't Chinese rural women be able to fully exert their strength like Soviet rural women? I believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, as long as everyone works hard, it can definitely be done."

The agricultural model worker from Inner Mongolia, leader of the Zalaite Banner Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hinggan League, Morigele, said:

"The welcome we received in the Kazakh Republic was so warm that it is hard to describe. To welcome us, the Stalin Collective Farm in Taldy-Kurgan Oblast decided to increase the yield of sugar beets from 6,000 jin per mu to 8,667 jin per mu. The Lenin Collective Farm in Jambyl Oblast decided to increase sugar beets from 5,333 jin per mu to 8,667 jin per mu. Sunirata, a 72-year-old man from the Lenin Collective Farm, produced 9,730 jin of sugar beets per mu last year, and expects to produce more than 10,000 jin this year. He said: 'If China needs me, I can go to China to help you.'

Kazakhstan's livestock are very well-fed. Many experiences can be learned. Their cattle breeds have all been improved. Before the improvement, bulls weighed no more than 1,200 jin, and cows produced 400-500 liters of milk per year; after the improvement, bulls weighed around 2,000 jin, and cows produced 5,000 liters of milk per year. Their herds graze in one place for five to ten days and then move to another place, returning to the original place after more than a month; this rotation allows grass to grow in the places the herds leave, and the insects in the manure die, ensuring that the livestock do not get sick. They feed their livestock with fixed amounts of feed, and have reserves of fodder, so the livestock can continue to breed."

The Northwest agricultural model worker, Wang Debiao from northern Shaanxi, said:

"The collective farms in Kazakhstan are indeed good. Labor is calculated reasonably, everyone works hard, and there are no lazy people. Women and men go to the fields to produce the same amount, and the remuneration is the same. Collective management is much better than individual management. Our individual farmers cultivate and harvest by hand; Soviet collective farmers use machines. When insect pests are found in our crops, we catch them by hand; they use airplanes to spray powder to kill the pests. In Kazakhstan, each mu produces about 400 jin of wheat, which is many times higher than in our area. We have very few livestock; their public livestock, on average, have several heads per person. We have one person looking after ten to twenty sheep; they have four people looking after four hundred sheep. We can shear at most eight or nine sheep a day; they use electric shears to shear one hundred and twenty to thirty sheep a day. Our sheep produce less than two jin of coarse wool; theirs produce eight to twelve jin of fine wool, and some up to twenty jin. Our sheep generally weigh thirty jin, their sheep generally weigh one hundred and fifty jin, and some weigh more than two hundred jin; pigs weigh more than four hundred jin, and some weigh more than six hundred jin, and cattle weigh nearly two thousand jin. These are all the results of agricultural collectivization, mechanization, and scientificization."

The agricultural model worker from Xinjiang, Abudula Simayi Xiyite, said:

"Kazakhstan's high-yield cotton fields produce 933 jin of seed cotton per mu, high-yield wheat fields produce 693 jin of wheat per mu, a sheep weighs 150-160 jin, and a cow produces 15 liters of milk a day; Xinjiang's Kashgar irrigated cotton fields produce only 573 jin of seed cotton per mu, irrigated fields produce only 200 jin of wheat per mu, sheep weigh 30 jin, and cows produce 5 liters of milk a day. We must go back and vigorously promote the benefits of collective farms."

Lu Hongbin, the leader of the "Lu Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative," which won the title of National Comprehensive High-Yield Model, from Shandong, said:

"Before we came to the Soviet Union, we didn't understand what agricultural collectivization was all about. This time, we visited many collective farms, solved this problem, and learned the most important conditions for agricultural collectivization: one is the farmers' own awareness, and the other is the leadership of the working class. In many collective farms in the Caucasus, more than 90% of agricultural operations are mechanized. The twenty-one collective farms we saw cultivated an average of 135 mu to 375 mu of land per labor force. The mountainous areas of the Georgian Republic also use machines and electricity. Even tea pruning is done by machine. Agricultural machinery makes people's labor much easier. Without the creation and supply of workers, these things cannot be done. Collectivization and mechanization enable women to participate in production more extensively. In the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic of Georgia, the Beria Tea Collective Farm has eleven socialist labor heroes, nine of whom are women. Collectivized agriculture brings farmers infinite happiness. The Molotov Collective Farm in Abkhazia spent three million rubles to build a 'House of Culture,' a two-story building with thirty-two rooms, including a club with eight hundred seats, a library, a photo studio, and so on. All collective farm farmers are well-dressed, well-fed, and well-housed.

The twenty-one collective farms we saw were all developed from scratch, from small to large. Most of them were developed from mutual aid teams. There were also cases of acute illness and the establishment of egalitarian agricultural communes, but that was an individual situation. The Molotov Collective Farm in Kabuleti District, Georgian Republic, had only twenty-eight households when it was established, and now has more than two hundred households. Our mutual aid group was transformed into a production cooperative last year. Some people who don't understand the truth said that we will soon be eating from the 'big pot.' This time, we saw that Soviet collective farms also do not eat from the 'big pot.' On the contrary, more labor means more gain, less labor means less gain, work has quotas, and there are rewards for exceeding quotas. China's agriculture must take the road of collectivization. After we go back, we must vigorously promote the benefits of agricultural collectivization to the masses.

The Soviet people love China very much. The collective farm in Stalin's hometown of Gori slaughtered a calf and two piglets to entertain us. When people knew that we were model workers, they often hugged and kissed us, and asked for addresses for communication. Sometimes three or four thousand people came to greet us. Children tied red scarves around our necks. The Soviet people told us their experience without reservation. They said: 'Take our experience back to China so that China can reach a socialist society as soon as possible.' We will never forget the friendship of the Soviet people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with such close friends and with model workers taking the lead, we will surely be able to go to socialism, and the imperialist bandits cannot stop us."

Dong Lisheng, an agricultural woman model worker from Shandong, said:

"I am very interested in working with machines. We use manual labor to harvest kenaf in our area, while the Soviet Union uses machines to harvest kenaf, flax, corn, sugar beets, and potatoes. We also saw airplanes weeding; four airplanes spread a lot of medicine, and these medicines only kill weeds and do not harm crops. Agricultural machinery needs iron to manufacture, and also needs oil and electricity to operate, so agriculture can be mechanized only with a developed industry."

Xin Zixiu, the leader of a model agricultural production cooperative from Henan, said:

"At first, I had doubts about the extent of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union. After seeing tobacco transplanters, cotton pickers, etc., the doubts were dispelled. In Kuban and Azerbaijan, we saw artificial rainmakers, which made me very happy. Azerbaijan has very little rainfall in summer and autumn, and the fields are irrigated by diverting river water and digging underground artesian wells. A hydroelectric power station is being built there, which is a help from the working class big brothers to the farmers. There are many things in the Soviet collective farms that are worth learning from us. For example, the collective farms are divided into production teams and production groups, and the inspection work is very careful; Azerbaijan's cotton fields adopt a six-year rotation system (the first and second years are planted with pasture, the third, fourth, and fifth years are planted with cotton, and the sixth year is planted with grain). After returning to China, I will suggest to our production cooperative: we should formulate work quotas, allocate three to five mu of land to experiment with cotton rotation, experiment with hybrid silkworms and grafting mulberry trees to develop sericulture, study the use of barren mountains for animal husbandry, block small mountain ravines into reservoirs, and plant more trees and afforest the Yellow River滩."

Jiang Zaiqiu, the head of a model agricultural mutual aid group from Guangxi, said:

"We have personally seen the happy life that agricultural collectivization and mechanization bring to Soviet farmers. We in China now need to strengthen the organization of labor mutual aid, run agricultural production cooperatives well, and make every farmer aware of the benefits of collectivization, so as to develop collectivization. In addition to autumn plowing, fertilization, seed selection, pest control and other technologies, the Soviet Union's advanced experience is worthy of our learning. The collective farm's democratic system (chairmen, management committee and supervision committee members must be elected), and work inspection system, are even more worthy of our learning. This time, I deeply felt the sincerity of the Soviet people's friendship. They are our best friends."

Wang Hanguo, the leader of the National Rice High-Yield Model Mutual Aid Group from Guangdong, said:

"There are many benefits of agricultural collectivization in the Soviet Union. Individual farmers each have a small plot of land, which cannot be divided for cooperation, nor can they use machines, rotate crops, or develop diversified economies. We saw that the Soviet Union uses machines for plowing, tilling, sowing, turning the soil, leveling the soil, weeding, fertilizing, pest control, harvesting, cotton picking, tobacco planting, and flax planting and harvesting. Machines save a lot of manpower. There are no poor individual farmers who work hard in the Soviet Union. Elderly and disabled collective farmers receive help from the mutual aid fund. Patients can be treated free of charge in hospitals. Nurseries and kindergartens are also free. Every child can study for seven years for free from the age of seven. Each household of collective farmers has electric lights, running water, radios, and some even have cars. Their clothes, food, and household equipment are better than those of the past landlords in our area. It is necessary to take the road of agricultural collectivization, which is the conclusion we reached during our visit."

    农业集体化的好处说不完（下）
    ——中国农民劳动模范谈访苏观感
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　李何
    黑龙江的农业妇女劳动模范郭玉兰说：
    “集体化和机械化使苏联农村妇女广泛参加生产，这是最使我们感动的。我们看见集体农场的大片麦田没有用多少人，收割时也只要一辆联合收割机和几个妇女。在各种农作过程中，参加工作的妇女都不少于男子。我们在乌克兰会见了苏联第一个女拖拉机手安格林娜。集体农场发展养畜业，使更多的妇女可以工作。每个集体农场都有托儿所，妇女产前产后不但有休假，而且在产假期中还得到百分之五十到百分之百的劳动日报酬。我想，中国农业将来集体化和机械化以后，中国农村妇女岂不是也能和苏联农村妇女一样充分发挥自己的力量吗？我相信，在毛主席领导下，只要大家努力，那一定是可以办到的。”
    内蒙古农业劳动模范、兴安盟扎赉特旗农业生产合作社领导人莫日格策说：
    “我们在哈萨克共和国所受的欢迎，其热烈是难以形容的。为了迎接我们，塔尔达·库尔干州斯大林集体农场决定把甜菜的产量从每亩产六千斤提高到八千六百六十七斤，江布尔州列宁集体农场决定把甜菜从每亩产五千三百三十三斤提高到八千六百六十七斤。列宁集体农场的七十二岁老爹苏尼拉塔，去年每亩产甜菜九千七百三十斤，今年可产一万多斤，他说：‘如果中国需要我，我可以到中国去帮助你们。’
    哈萨克的牲畜喂养得很好。许多经验可以学习。他们的牛种都改良了。在未改良以前，公牛体重不超过一千二百斤，母牛挤乳量一年四、五百升；改良以后，公牛体重二千斤左右，母牛挤乳量一年五千升。他们的畜群在一个地方放牧五天到十天后转移到另一个地方，经过一个多月以后才转回原地；这样轮流放牧，使得畜群离开的地方都长起青草，畜粪里长的虫都死掉，保证牲畜不生病。他们喂的饲料有定量，草料有贮备，所以牲畜可以不断繁殖。”
    西北农业劳动模范、陕北的王德彪说：
    “哈萨克的集体农场的确好。劳动计工，特别合理，人人努力，没有懒汉。妇女和男子一样上地生产，报酬也和男子一样。集体经营比个体经营高明得多。我们的个体农民用手耕作和收割；苏联的集体农民用机器。我们那里农作物发现害虫时用手捉；他们用飞机撒药粉来扑灭害虫。在哈萨克每亩地产麦子四百斤左右，比我们那里高许多倍。我们那里牲口很少；他们的公共牲畜，平均起来，一人有好几头。我们那里一个人揽一二十只羊；他们四个人揽四百只羊。我们那里一个人剪羊毛一天最多剪八、九只；他们用电剪一天剪一百二、三十只。我们那里一只羊产粗毛不上两斤；他们的一只羊产细毛八斤到十二斤，有些到二十斤。我们那里的羊一般重三十斤，他们的羊一般重一百五十斤，也有二百多斤的；猪重四百多斤，也有重六百多斤的，牛有重近二千斤的。这些都是农业集体化、机械化和科学化的结果。”
    新疆农业劳动模范阿布都拉·司马益·西伊特说：
    “哈萨克的集体农场的丰产棉田每亩产九百三十三斤籽棉，丰产麦田每亩产六百九十三斤小麦，一只羊重一百五六十斤，母牛一天挤十五升乳；新疆喀什灌溉的好棉田每亩不过产五百七十三斤籽棉，灌溉田每亩不过产二百斤麦子，羊重三十斤，母牛一天挤五升乳。我们回去要好好宣传集体农场的好处。”
    获得全国全面丰产模范称号的“吕鸿宾农业生产合作社”的领导人、山东的吕鸿宾说：
    “我们没来苏联以前，不明白农业集体化是怎么回事。这次我们参观了许多集体农场，解决了这个问题，知道了农业集体化的最重要条件，一个是农民自己的觉悟，一个是工人阶级的领导。高加索许多集体农场的农业操作百分之九十以上机械化了。我们看到的二十一个集体农场每个劳动力平均耕地一百三十五亩到三百七十五亩。格鲁吉亚共和国的山地也使用机器和电力。连茶叶的剪枝也用机器。农业机器使人们的劳动轻松得多了。如果没有工人的创造和供应，就做不到这些。集体化、机械化使妇女能更广泛地参加生产。格鲁吉亚的阿布哈则自治共和国，有个贝利亚茶叶集体农场，那里十一个社会主义劳动英雄中有九个是妇女。集体化的农业带给农民无限的幸福。阿布哈则的莫洛托夫集体农场用三百万卢布盖了一座‘文化之家’，两层楼，三十二间房，内有八百个座位的俱乐部，还有图书馆、照像室等等。所有集体农场的农民都穿得好，吃得好，住得好。
    我们所看的二十一个集体农场，都是从无到有，从小到大的。大部分都是从共耕社发展起来的。也有犯过急性病，建立过平均主义的农业公社，但那是个别的情形。格鲁吉亚共和国卡布列提区莫洛托夫集体农场成立时才二十八户，现在有二百多户。我们的互助组去年转为生产合作社。有些不明事理的人说，快吃‘大锅饭’了。我们这次参观，看到苏联集体农场也不吃‘大锅饭’。相反的，多劳动多得，少劳动少得，工作有定额，超额有奖励。中国农业必须走集体化的道路。我们回去后要好好向群众宣传农业集体化的好处。
    苏联人民非常热爱中国。斯大林故乡哥里的集体农场杀了一只小牛和两条小猪来招待我们。人们知道我们是劳动模范后，常常抱着我们接吻，要求留地址通讯。有时有三四千人来迎接我们。儿童们把红领巾结在我们的脖子上。苏联人民把经验无保留地告诉我们，他们说：‘把我们的经验带回中国去，使中国早日走到社会主义社会。’苏联人民的友谊，我们一辈子也忘不了。我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，有这样亲密的朋友，又有劳动模范带头，一定能够走到社会主义去，帝国主义强盗是挡不住我们的。”
    山东农业妇女劳动模范董力生说：
    “我对于用机器工作的兴趣很大。我们那里用人工收洋麻，苏联收洋麻、亚麻、玉米、甜菜、洋芋，都使用机器。我们还看见飞机除草；四架飞机撒下许多药，这些药只杀草不害庄稼。农业机器需要铁来制造，也需要石油和电力来开动，所以要有发达的工业，农业才能机械化。”
    河南模范农业生产合作社领导人辛自修说：
    “我开始时对于苏联农业机械化到什么程度有疑问。看了烟草栽苗机、摘棉机等等后，疑问打消了。在库班和阿塞拜疆，我们都看到人工降雨器，这使我非常高兴。阿塞拜疆在夏秋雨量极少，田地靠引河水和打地下自流井灌溉。那里正在建筑一个水电站，这都是工人老大哥对农民的帮助。苏联集体农场有很多东西值得我们学习。例如：集体农场分生产队、生产组，检查工作非常认真；阿塞拜疆棉田采用六年轮种制（第一第二年种牧草，第三、四、五年种棉花，第六年种谷物），回国后，我将向我们的生产合作社建议：要制订工作定额，要拨三、五亩地来试验棉花轮种，要试验杂交山蚕和接种桑树来发展养蚕业，要研究利用荒山养畜，要把小山壑堵成蓄水池，要在黄河滩多栽树造林。”
    广西模范农业互助组长蒋在球说：
    “我们亲眼看到农业集体化和机械化带给苏联农民的幸福生活。我们中国现在要加强组织劳动互助，办好农业生产合作社，使每个农民都知道集体化的好处，这样来发展集体化。苏联先进经验，除秋耕、施肥、选种、防虫等技术，值得我们学习之外，集体农场的民主制度（主席、管理委员会和监察委员会委员要经过选举），和工作检查制度，更值得我们学习。这次我亲切地感到苏联人民友谊的诚挚，他们是我们最好的朋友。”
    全国水稻丰产模范互助组组长广东的汪汉国说：
    “苏联农业集体化的好处多得很。个体农民各人一小块地，是既不能分工合作，也不能使用机器，不能轮种，不能发展多种经济的。我们看到苏联在犁地、耕地、播种、翻土、平土、除草、施肥、除虫、收割、摘棉、种烟、种收麻，都用机器。机器节省了许多人力。苏联没有贫苦的工作繁重的个体农民。年老和残废的集体农民从互助基金得到帮助。病人有医院可以免费治疗。托儿所和幼儿园也是免费的。每个儿童从七岁起可以免费念七年书。各户集体农民有电灯、自来水、收音机，有的还有小汽车。他们穿的、吃的和家庭的设备，赛过我们那里过去的财主。必须走农业集体化的道路，这是我们参观中所得的结论。”
