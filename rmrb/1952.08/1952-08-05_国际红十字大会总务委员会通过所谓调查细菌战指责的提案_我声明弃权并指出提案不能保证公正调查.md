Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, August 4th: The General Committee of the 18th International Red Cross Conference, at its final meeting on the 2nd, passed a joint proposal by the United Kingdom and Belgium, so-called "urging the governments of all countries concerned with the accusations of bacteriological warfare in Korea to agree, on a mutually agreeable basis, to submit to investigation." The Chinese delegation abstained during the vote. Before the vote, Li Dequan, chief delegate of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, issued a statement pointing out that the joint UK-Belgium proposal did not include the conditions necessary to guarantee an impartial investigation. The statement also requested the conference to reconsider the Chinese delegation's proposal of July 30, which called on national Red Cross societies to mobilize world public opinion to demand an immediate cessation of all atrocities in Korea that violate the Geneva Conventions.

The statement issued by Li Dequan is as follows: "I have made it clear that our position is: the conference should reconsider the proposal submitted by the Chinese delegation on July 30, which was rejected, and should first study the conclusive evidence we possess. Furthermore, the joint UK-Belgium proposal now before us does not include the conditions I just mentioned that are necessary to guarantee an impartial investigation. Under these circumstances, the Chinese delegation wishes to declare that it will abstain from the vote."

    国际红十字大会总务委员会通过所谓调查细菌战指责的提案
    我声明弃权并指出提案不能保证公正调查
    【新华社多伦多四日电】第十八届国际红十字大会总务委员会在二日举行最后一次会议时通过了英国和比利时联合提出的所谓“敦促与在朝鲜进行细菌战指责有关的各国政府在大家同意的基础上听从调查”的提案。在进行表决时，中国代表团弃权。中国红十字会代表团首席代表李德全在进行表决前发表声明指出：英、比联合提案并不包括能够保证公正调查所必需的条件。声明并要求大会重新考虑中国代表团七月三十日所提出的关于号召各国红十字会动员全世界舆论，要求立即停止在朝鲜发生的一切违反日内瓦公约的暴行的提案。
    李德全发表的声明如下：“我已经表明我们的态度是：大会应该重新考虑七月三十日被否决的中国代表团所提出的提案，并且首先应该研究我们所掌握的确凿证据。不仅如此，现在摆在我们面前的英比联合提案，并不包括我刚刚所谈到的为保证公正调查所必需的条件。在这种情况下，中国代表团愿意声明它将在表决时弃权。”
