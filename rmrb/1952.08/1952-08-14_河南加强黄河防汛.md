Henan Strengthens Yellow River Flood Control

The masses along the Yellow River in Henan Province are actively engaged in flood prevention. The organized flood prevention teams along the Yellow River have reached more than 58,000 people. Many townships and villages have formulated patriotic flood prevention covenants. Flood prevention workers in Xiniu Village, Chenggao County, have initiated a patriotic flood prevention competition challenge to flood prevention workers in various districts and townships along the river. At present, all flood prevention tools and materials are fully prepared. Dike surfaces, water channels, and wave nests have been filled and compacted, and the watch houses have been renovated. Flood prevention workers in various places have already gone to the dikes.

Since the Yellow River entered the autumn flood season, the entire line of dikes has been inspected, and the cone penetration work on the main dikes has been largely completed. Except for individual sections of the beach banks that need to be repaired due to river changes, all sections of the line are stable. (Xinhua News Agency)

    河南加强黄河防汛
    河南省黄河沿岸群众积极防汛。黄河沿岸组织起来的防汛队员已达五万八千多人。不少乡、村都订立了爱国防汛公约。成皋县西牛庄乡防汛员并向沿河各区、乡防汛员发起爱国防汛竞赛挑战。目前，全线防汛用的工具物料都已准备齐全。堤面水沟浪窝均经填平踏实，看水屋也经整修完竣。各地防汛员已经上堤。
    黄河进入秋汛以来，全线堤岸都已经过检查，大堤锥探工作也已大部完成。除个别地段的滩岸因河势变化须加修外，全线各工段均称平稳。 （新华社）
