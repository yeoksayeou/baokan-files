    Further Improve Coal Mine Tunneling Efficiency
    For more than two months, most state-owned coal mines in North China have vigorously promoted the advanced experience of the Ma Liu Hai team's tunneling work and have achieved results. The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, which originally had doubts about Ma Liu Hai's experience and planned to develop its own set of tunneling methods, also approved a promotion plan at the workers' congress. As of June 15, 68 rapid tunneling teams in North China had implemented multi-hole cyclical operations, and the tunneling progress of these teams has greatly increased. In June, the average progress of each team was 2.5 to 3.5 times faster than the old single-heading tunneling method.
    However, the progress of these tunneling teams is also inconsistent. According to May statistics, some teams have achieved a monthly advance of about 750 meters, most teams advance 300 meters per month, and a few teams progress only more than 100 meters per month. Therefore, the current promotion work of various mines, in addition to helping the first type of team continue to improve tunneling efficiency, should focus on bringing the latter two types of teams to an average advanced quota level, in order to further improve the efficiency and progress of rapid tunneling teams. If each team can achieve a monthly progress of 500 meters to 750 meters, then this year's tunneling plan for various mines in North China can be completed about three months ahead of schedule, saving the country more than 399,800 workdays compared with the actual efficiency of the old tunneling methods. The past situation where tunneling plans could not be completed frequently, and tunneling work could not keep up with the needs of mining, will no longer occur.
    Can most of the rapid tunneling teams achieve this figure every month? As long as the leading cadres and workers of various mines continue to work hard on the existing basis, boldly carry out various necessary improvements, and increase the number of cycles and the progress of each drilling and blasting, it is entirely possible to achieve this progress.
    To improve tunneling efficiency, it is necessary to increase the number of cycles for tunneling workers. The key to increasing the number of cycles lies in solving the transportation problem. The Ma Liu Hai team's multi-hole cyclical operation method solved the problem of idling caused by tunneling workers and transportation workers not being able to operate simultaneously in a single roadway. However, after the specialization of work types in cyclical operations, the technology and tools for drilling and blasting have been continuously improved, which makes the contradiction between mechanized tunneling work and handicraft-style transportation work more prominent. Because, if the transportation workers cannot transport the coal out in time, the roadway cannot be freed up, the tunneling workers cannot enter the roadway to work, the number of cycles cannot be increased, the tunneling progress cannot be accelerated, and new idling phenomena occur again. For example, the electric drills in most mines can work up to six hours per shift, and in many tunneling teams of the Datong Mining Bureau, because the cart pushers cannot keep up with the tunneling workers, the tunneling workers can only work four or five hours within each eight-hour shift. The North China Preparatory Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union once counted the working time for each cycle of tunneling workers and transportation workers in a tunneling team of the Yangquan Mining Bureau: two drilling and blasting workers need 40 minutes to drill a set of holes; eight loading and transportation workers need one hour and 36 minutes to load 24 carts of coal (0.7 tons per cart) for each blasting, at a rate of one cart every four minutes. In this way, the time spent on drilling and blasting is half that of the loading workers, how can the tunneling workers not be idle! This situation in transportation work has now become an obstacle to the continued progress of tunneling work. If this problem is not solved, even if the tools and operating methods for drilling and blasting are continuously improved, the idling phenomenon will still not be solved, and may even become more and more serious.
    Currently, the situation of transportation work is: loading relies entirely on physical labor, so the speed is not fast; track laying cannot keep up with the tunneling progress, and coal carts cannot be pushed to the front; many roadways have not laid double tracks, and empty and loaded cars cannot be moved, and the lack of strict division of labor between loading workers and cart pushers sometimes leads to congestion, affecting the transportation speed. Therefore, the administrative leaders of various mines should pay attention to these problems and try to fully supply equipment such as tracks, switches, and turntables, lay double tracks in all tunneling roadways, and keep the switches close to the face at all times. In places with slopes, especially large slopes, horse-drawn machines and inorganic ropes should be added. The transportation distance of the coal face should be shortened, and when the coal face transportation workers push the carts to a certain distance, they should be continued by other transportation workers. In this way, the transportation speed can be greatly accelerated. The administrative side should also work with the trade union to mobilize workers and technicians to improve the existing labor organization, so that cart pushers and loading workers can carry out division of labor. In this handicraft labor, the more detailed and strict the division of labor, the faster the speed will be; at the same time, mobilize the masses to use their brains to find tricks and try to improve the existing loading and transportation tools. If these can be done, the situation where transportation cannot keep up with tunneling can be greatly improved.
    To reform transportation work, it is also necessary to break the conservative thinking from leading cadres and technicians. Many cadres have seen that transportation work affects the progress of tunneling work, but instead of trying to reform it on the existing basis, they are waiting for the state to allocate a large number of mechanical equipment to fully mechanize transportation work. Mechanization is a thorough solution to the transportation problem, which is true. However, mechanization of transportation requires a large amount of investment from the state, and it is not a problem that can be solved all at once. But the current transportation problem urgently needs improvement. Abandoning the work that should be done now and waiting for mechanization is a manifestation of conservative thinking that is afraid of trouble and unwilling to carry out reforms. In the process of promoting the advanced experience of the Ma Liu Hai team, this fear of trouble, unwillingness to carry out various necessary reforms, and other forms of conservative thinking have been constantly criticized, but it cannot be assumed that conservative thinking no longer exists. If the struggle against this backward thinking is relaxed, the reform of transportation work will be difficult to carry out smoothly.
    Of course, improving the operating skills of tunneling work is also a necessary measure to further improve tunneling efficiency. At present, many tunneling teams have not yet implemented deep-hole operations, and at the same time, the progress of each blasting generally does not reach the depth of the blast holes, so the progress of drilling and blasting in each cycle is not fast. In mid-June, the National Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union has summarized the large-hole deep-hole blasting method of Hong Liujing of Hongshan Coal Mine, and the conical hollow eye-bottom blasting method (ie, hollow blasting method) of Jiaozuo Mining Bureau. After adopting these two methods, not only can the drilling depth be greatly increased, but the progress of each blasting can exceed the depth of the blast holes by a large margin. The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry has instructed various mines to conscientiously implement these advanced operating methods. Some tunneling teams have already adopted these advanced operating methods, and the effect is very good. The responsible cadres of various mines should take concrete and effective measures to educate tunneling workers to generally learn these new operating methods in order to improve tunneling efficiency.
    Improving transportation work and the operating skills of drilling and blasting are the main problems in improving tunneling efficiency. However, there are also a few teams that started the promotion work relatively late and cannot skillfully implement cyclical operations, or the supply of tools and equipment cannot keep up, so the cyclical operations are not normal enough, and the tunneling efficiency is not high enough. While vigorously solving the above two problems, various mines must also help these teams to master cyclical operations as soon as possible, so that they can quickly reach a general level.

### 把煤矿掘进效率提高一步

    把煤矿掘进效率提高一步
    两个多月以来，华北大多数国营煤矿大力推广了马六孩小组掘进工作的先进经验，并已获得成绩。原来对马六孩经验尚有怀疑而准备另搞一套掘进工作法的焦作矿务局，也在职工代表大会上通过了推广计划。截至六月十五日为止，华北已有六十八个快速掘进组实行了多孔循环作业，这些组的掘进进度大大增加。六月份各组一般进度都比旧法单巷掘进快二倍半到三倍半。
    但是，这些掘进小组的进度也是不一致的，据五月份统计，有些小组月进已达七百五十公尺左右，大多数小组为月进三百公尺，也有少数小组每月进度只有一百公尺以上。因此目前各矿山的推广工作，除了帮助第一类小组继续提高掘进效率外，更应该集中力量使后两类小组达到一种平均先进定额的水平，以进一步提高快速掘进组的效率和进度。假使各个组每月的进度都能达到五百公尺至七百五十公尺，那么，今年华北各矿的掘进计划就都可以提前三个月左右完成，比起旧的掘进方法的实际效率，可为国家节省三十九万九千八百多工。过去掘进计划经常不能完成，因而掘进工作赶不上回采需要的情况就不会再出现了。
    大多数的快速掘进组每月的进度能否达到这个数字呢？只要各矿山的领导干部和职工群众在现有基础上继续努力，大胆进行各种必要的改进，增加掘进工人的循环次数和每次打眼放炮的进度，达到这个进度是完全可能的。
    要提高掘进效率，必须增加掘进工人的循环次数。而增加循环次数的关键又在于解决运搬问题。马六孩小组的多孔循环作业法，解决了在一个巷道内掘进工和运搬工不能同时操作的窝工问题。但是，在实行循环作业工种专业化后，工人打眼放炮的技术和工具不断改进，这就使机械化的掘进工作和手工业方式的运搬工作之间的矛盾更加突出。因为，运搬工不能及时把煤装运出去，则巷道空不出来，掘进工不能进巷工作，循环次数就无法增加，掘进进度也无法加快，新的窝工现象又发生了。例如目前大多数矿山的电钻每班至多能工作六小时左右，大同矿务局的许多掘进组，因为推车工赶不上掘进工，掘进工每班八小时内只能工作四五小时。中国煤矿工会华北区筹备委员会曾经统计了阳泉矿务局一个掘进小组掘进工和运搬工每循环一次的工作时间：打眼放炮工二人，打一楂炮需四十分钟；装运工八人，每放一楂炮出煤二十四车（每车零点七吨），每四分钟装一车，共需一小时三十六分。像这样，打眼放炮所用时间比装车工的少了一半，掘进工怎样能够不窝工呢！运搬工作的这种情况，目前已成了掘进工作继续前进的障碍。这个问题不解决，纵然打眼放炮的工具和操作方法不断地改进，窝工现象仍然无法解决，甚至会越来越严重。
    目前，运搬工作的状况是：装车全靠体力劳动，因而速度不快；道轨铺设赶不上掘进进度，煤车推不到迎头前面；不少巷道没有铺设双轨，空、重车调动不开，加以装煤工和推车工没有严格分工，有时发生拥挤现象，影响运搬速度。因此各矿行政领导方面，应该重视这些问题，设法充分供应道轨、道岔、转盘等设备，在掘进巷道内都铺双轨，同时使道岔时时接近迎头，在有坡度特别是坡度大的地方应增设马机和无机绳。煤头的运搬距离应缩短，煤头运搬工推车至一定距离时，即应由另外的运搬工继续运搬。这样，运搬的速度就可以加快许多。行政方面还应该协同工会发动工人和技术人员，改善现有的劳动组织，使推车工和装运工进行分工，在这种手工业劳动中，分工越细致严密，速度就越快；同时发动群众开动脑筋找窍门，设法改进现有的装运工具。能够做到这些，就可以大大地改善运搬赶不上掘进的情况。
    要改革运搬工作，还必须打破来自领导干部和技术人员的保守思想。很多干部已经看到了运搬工作影响了掘进工作的进度，但却不从现有基础上设法进行改革，而是等待着国家调拨给大批机械设备，使运搬工作全部机械化。机械化是彻底解决运搬问题的办法，这是不错的。但是，运搬机械化需要国家的大批投资，又不是一下子就能解决的问题。而目前运搬问题却已迫切需要改进。放弃目前应该作的工作而等待机械化的这种想法，正是害怕麻烦不愿进行改革的保守思想的一种表现。推广马六孩小组先进经验的过程中，这种害怕麻烦不愿进行各种必要的改革的和其他种种形色的保守思想虽曾不断受到批判，但并不能认为保守思想已经不复存在了。假使放松了对这种落后的思想的斗争，运搬工作的改革就很难顺利进行。
    当然，改进掘进工作的操作技术，也是进一步提高掘进效率的必要措施。目前，很多掘进组还没有实行深孔作业，同时，每楂炮的进度一般都还达不到炮眼的深度，因而，每次循环中打眼放炮的进度不快。六月中，煤矿工会全国委员会已经总结了洪山煤矿洪六井的大眼深孔爆破法，和焦作矿务局的圆椎空心眼底爆破法（即空心放炮法）。采用了这两个办法后，不但打眼深度可以大大加深，并且每楂炮的进度可以超过炮眼的深度很多。中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局已经指示各矿认真推行这些先进的操作方法。有的掘进组已经采用了这些先进的操作方法，效果很好。各矿山的负责干部应该采取具体的有效措施，教育掘进工人普遍学会这些新的操作方法，以提高掘进效率。
    改进运搬工作和打眼放炮的操作技术是提高掘进效率的主要问题。但是也还有少数小组因为推广工作开始得较迟，还不能熟练地实行循环作业，或者工具器材供应不上，因而循环作业进行得还不够正常，掘进效率还不够高。各个矿山在大力解决上述两个问题的同时，还必须帮助这些小组尽快地掌握循环作业，使他们很快地能够达到一般的水平。更　正
