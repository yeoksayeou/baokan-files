    The People's Bank of China, Suiyuan Provincial Branch
    Will Improve Loan Operations in the Ih Ju League Autonomous Region

    Editor: The reader Du Zhong's criticism of our bank's loan work in the Ih Ju League Autonomous Region, published in the "Reader's Letters" section on July 16th, is entirely correct.

    The Ih Ju League is a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area, spanning thousands of miles, with dispersed residents and inconvenient transportation. In order to help the local people restore and develop agricultural and animal husbandry production, we have issued a large number of loans. However, because banking institutions are not widespread, the strength of cadres is weak, some practices are not in line with the local specific conditions, and even some cadres emphasize objective difficulties and do not pay enough attention to the production and interests of the farmers and herdsmen, resulting in loans being issued out of season and delaying production. The bank's improper handling of the issue of interest-free periods for loans entrusted to the people's governments of various banners (旗) and districts has also seriously affected the production of the masses and the relationship between the government and the people. We are now preparing to make the following improvements:

    1. Expand the grassroots organization and business scope of the bank in the league. In addition to changing the original Dongsheng County Sub-branch to the Ih Ju League Sub-branch in April, we have also successively established seven business offices and two rural financial teams in the league's Dalad Banner, Hanggin Banner, Uxin Banner, and Junggar Banner. We strive to convert qualified business offices into sub-branches within the year, and prepare to establish a number of rural financial teams.

    2. Regarding the issue of interest-free periods for loans, we instructed the Ih Ju League Sub-branch on June 17th: For all loans issued by our bank entrusted to governments at all levels, especially seed and agricultural implement loans handled through in-kind transactions, due to the purchase process, it is impossible to issue all loans to farmers in a very short period of time. In order to take care of the special circumstances in the Ih Ju League area and the actual difficulties of the government in handling agricultural loans on behalf of the bank, it is temporarily stipulated that interest should be calculated at the discretion of the actual loan date for farmers. However, the maximum entrusted agency period should not exceed one month, and interest will be calculated as usual beyond this period. In addition, we should strengthen loan planning. If any loan surpluses are found, they should be recovered immediately to avoid idle funds.

### 中国人民银行绥远省分行  将改进伊盟自治区贷款业务

    中国人民银行绥远省分行
    将改进伊盟自治区贷款业务
    编辑同志：七月十六日“读者来信专页”所刊读者杜仲对我行在伊克昭盟自治区贷款工作的批评，是完全正确的。
    伊克昭盟是半农半牧的区域，辖境纵横千里，居民分散，交通不便。我们为了帮助当地群众恢复和发展农牧业生产，发放了大批贷款。但因为银行机构不普遍，干部力量薄弱，某些做法不切合当地具体情况，甚至某些干部强调客观困难，对农牧群众生产与利益关心不够，致贷放失时，贻误生产。银行对委托各旗区人民政府贷放中间空息问题也处理不当，又严重地影响了群众生产和政府与人民的关系。现在我们准备作如下改进：
    一、扩大该盟银行的基层组织和业务地区范围。我们除在四月间已将原来的东胜县支行改为伊克昭盟支行外，并已陆续在该盟的达拉特旗、杭锦旗、乌审旗、郡王旗等地建立了七个营业所和二个农村金融小组。我们争取在年内把有条件的营业所改建支行，并准备再建立若干农村金融小组。
    二、关于贷款的空息问题，我们在今年六月十七日已经指示伊克昭盟支行：我行委托各级人民政府发放的各项贷款，尤其是通过实物办理的种籽、农具贷款等，因有一段购制过程，不可能在很短时期内将所有贷款全部发放到农民手中；为照顾伊克昭盟地区的特殊情况及政府代办农贷的实际困难，暂规定酌情按农民实际贷款之日起计算利息。但委托代办期限最多不得超过一月，逾此期限照例计算利息。此外并应加强贷款计划性，如发现贷款剩余当即收回，以避免资金闲置。
