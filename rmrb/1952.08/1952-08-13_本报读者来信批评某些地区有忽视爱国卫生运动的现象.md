    Readers' Letters to the Editor Criticize the Neglect of the Patriotic Health Campaign in Some Areas

    The Patriotic Health Campaign has been widely launched throughout the country and has achieved great results. However, the development of the campaign is still uneven. According to readers' letters to this newspaper, the Patriotic Health Campaign in some areas and units has not been carried out universally and deeply, and some leading cadres have not given the campaign the attention it deserves. In order to awaken the attention of leading cadres and the masses in these areas and units, we are publishing the following excerpts from these letters.

    Reader Zhu Dajun from Wuhu City wrote: "The leading organs in Wuhu City have not carried out in-depth publicity and education among the masses regarding the Patriotic Health Campaign, and the masses do not have sufficient understanding of sanitation work. Therefore, the Patriotic Health Campaign has not become a mass movement. There are many flies on the streets, and some fruit vendors do not cover the cut watermelons with gauze, allowing flies to lick them. The work of filling ponds, dredging ditches, and removing weeds in the city has not been carried out, resulting in many mosquitoes. Mosquitoes near Zhe Mountain come out to bite people even during the day. Some streets are covered with feces and have not been cleaned up in time." Reader Ma Qingfu from Tong County wrote: "I recently came to Tong County from Changxindian in Beijing. I found that many people in Tong County do not pay attention to sanitation work at all. In the morning, it is often seen that people are dumping dirty things in the alleys, so that some alleys are covered with feces and dirt. There are many flies in some restaurants, and they cannot be driven away. Some residents' homes are full of rainwater in broken buckets and basins, where mosquitoes breed. The health campaign in Tong County is significantly different from that in Changxindian." Reader Shao Shusheng from Jingxing Mining Area wrote: "The sanitation work in Jingxing Mining Area is very poorly done. Garbage is piled up on the streets, melon peels are everywhere, and some public toilets are not cleaned regularly, so there are many flies. Weeds grow wildly in the Mining Bureau, becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes, but the relevant authorities have not paid attention to it."

    Reader Shen An wrote: "After the Patriotic Health Campaign was launched in Xi'an City, many areas have become much cleaner. However, individual organs still do not pay attention to hygiene, becoming 'dead corners' in the campaign. The sanitation situation of the Northwest Electric Power Administration is extremely bad: the kitchen has a bad smell, and the rags are black; there are many weeds in the courtyard, and sewage is accumulated; the dormitories are messy, and some doorways are piled with garbage. The city health authorities have inspected the unit four times and made suggestions each time, but the situation has not changed so far. The sanitary conditions of the Baxiang Slaughterhouse of Shaanxi Meat Industry Company are particularly bad. Flies swarm in the kitchen, and the seepage pits are surrounded by animal blood and feces, with a pungent odor. When local health representatives went to inspect, the slaughterhouse staff even spoke coldly to them. The environmental sanitation of the Third Brigade of a certain military and political cadre school stationed in Tongjifang is also very poor. The local health authorities inspected them four times in succession, but they firmly refused to change, and instead said: 'We do not have the conditions and time to pay attention to sanitation.'"

    All the readers' letters unanimously pointed out: The Patriotic Health Campaign is a major event related to the health of the people. It is extremely wrong for the leading cadres in the above-mentioned areas and units to neglect sanitation work so much. It is hoped that the leading organs in the above-mentioned areas will strengthen the publicity and inspection work of the Patriotic Health Campaign, fully mobilize the masses, and create an atmosphere of cleanliness. Units that not only do not pay attention to hygiene but also resist inspection should be given serious criticism and education.

### 本报读者来信批评某些地区有忽视爱国卫生运动的现象

专栏：读者来信综述

    本报读者来信批评某些地区有忽视爱国卫生运动的现象
    爱国卫生运动已在全国范围内普遍展开，并且取得了巨大的成绩。但是，运动的发展还是不平衡的。根据本报读者来信反映，某些地区和某些单位的爱国卫生运动还没有普遍、深入地开展起来，有些领导干部对于这个运动还没有给予应有的重视。为了唤起这些地区和这些单位的领导干部和广大群众的注意，特将这些来信摘要发表于后。
    芜湖市读者朱大钧来信说：“芜湖市领导机关没有深入地向群众进行有关爱国卫生运动的宣传教育，群众对卫生工作还没有足够的认识，因此，爱国卫生运动还没有成为群众性的运动。街头苍蝇很多，有些瓜果摊贩在切开的西瓜上不盖纱罩，任凭苍蝇舐食。市内填塘疏沟和铲除杂草的工作没有开展起来，以致蚊子很多。赭山附近的蚊子在白天也飞出来咬人。有些街道粪便遍地，也没及时打扫。”通县读者马庆福来信说：“我是最近从北京长辛店来到通县的。我发现通县很多人对卫生工作极不注意。早晨经常可以看见有人在胡同里倒脏东西，以致某些胡同里粪便污物遍地皆是。有些饭店里苍蝇很多，赶都赶不走。有些居民家里的破桶烂盆积满雨水，蚊子繁生。通县的卫生运动和长辛店是显著不同的。”井陉矿区读者邵树生来信说：“井陉矿区的卫生工作做得很不好。街头垃圾堆积，瓜皮遍地，有些公共厕所也不经常打扫，苍蝇很多。矿务局内野草漫生，成为蚊子的巢穴，有关机关都未加以注意。”
    读者燊安来信说：“西安市开展爱国卫生运动后，很多地区清洁得多。但个别机关仍不讲求卫生，成为运动中的‘死角’。西北电业管理局的卫生情况极坏：厨房有臭气，抹布乌黑；院内野草很多，污水淤积；宿舍乱七八糟，有的门口还堆着垃圾。市卫生机关对该单位检查了四次，每次都提出意见，但至今情况还没改变。陕西省肉业公司八家巷屠宰场卫生情况尤其恶劣。厨房里苍蝇成群乱飞，渗坑周围到处是牲畜的污血和粪便，臭气薰人。当地卫生代表去检查时，屠宰场的人员还冷言冷语地说人家。驻通济坊的某部军政干部学校三大队的环境卫生情况也很不好。当地卫生机关先后检查了四次，他们坚决不改，反而说：‘我们没有条件和时间来讲卫生。’”
    所有读者来信一致指出：爱国卫生运动是有关人民生命健康的大事，上述地区和单位的领导干部竟如此忽视卫生工作，这是极为错误的。希望上述地区的领导机关，加强爱国卫生运动的宣传和检查工作，充分发动群众，造成爱清洁的空气。对于既不讲求卫生而又抗拒检查的单位，应该给予严正的批评教育。
