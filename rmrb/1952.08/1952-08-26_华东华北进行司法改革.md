East China and North China are launching judicial reform movements.

The judicial reform work in East China has achieved preliminary results. At present, judicial organs at all levels are combining organizational rectification to further systematically criticize the reactionary old legal concepts and old judicial styles. Since mid-June, the East China Military and Political Committee and the People's Governments of various provinces and cities have successively convened political and legal work conferences or judicial work conferences to discuss and deploy judicial reform work. After the meetings, they absorbed relevant political and legal organs to jointly form judicial reform work offices to carry out judicial reform work in a planned and led manner. People's courts at all levels have implemented the spirit of the instructions of the central government and the East China Party and government leading organs. The first stage of organizational rectification work was generally carried out in conjunction with ideological rectification, and the principle of attacking from both inside and outside and extensively mobilizing the masses was correctly implemented. The judicial reform work in East China is best done in Fujian, Anhui, and Southern Jiangsu. In terms of specific methods, it is generally to first organize the cadres of the People's Courts to study documents, with the leaders of the courts taking the lead in conducting ideological self-examination in connection with the documents, and then extensively mobilize the masses to boldly report and expose problems. For example, the Bengbu City People's Court in Anhui Province first convened a meeting of all staff members, where Wan Liyu, director of the Judicial Reform Work Office, made a mobilization report for study, and Court President Wu made a self-critical speech. This approach played a great enlightening and educational role for all staff members of the court, overcoming many incorrect views of some cadres on the judicial reform movement. Later, the city also convened a city-wide conference of grassroots cadres, propagandists, and representatives of mass organizations, as well as small meetings of workers, women, youth, and litigants, with a total of more than 27,000 people participating, collecting many materials on illegal and derelict behavior of judicial personnel. This fully exposed various serious problems of the People's Courts and formed a mass movement of judicial reform work.

Through the self-examination of staff members of the People's Courts at all levels in East China since the "Three-Anti" movement, and especially the reports and exposures of the broad masses, serious problems existing in the People's judicial organs in East China have been exposed.

First, the organization is impure. The power of adjudication in some judicial organs has been usurped by reactionary Party, League, and secret agent backbones and landlord bullies who have committed many evils. Among these bad elements are members of the pseudo-"Repentance Institute," presiding judges of special criminal courts, drafters of the "Regulations for Suppressing Rebellion," instructors of military intelligence training classes, and so on.

Reactionary old legal concepts and old judicial styles are also quite serious. People with old legal concepts do not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves in handling counter-revolutionary cases, treating counter-revolutionary elements and the people "equally"; regarding the crimes of counter-revolutionary elements, they emphasize "statute of limitations" and advocate "not blaming the past." In handling cases involving public-private relations or labor-capital disputes, they condone the "five poisons" crimes of illegal capitalists and their illegal oppression of workers. Illegal capitalists who steal and swindle state assets and violate the original contracts are regarded as disputes between two "legal persons," state organs, enterprises, and illegal capitalists, which are "civil debts." In handling cases of marriage and family disputes, they openly violate the Marriage Law and act as protectors of the feudal marriage system and feudal patriarchal rights. Many women who fight for the right to freedom of marriage have therefore suffered unexpected blows and persecution.

The old judicial style is quite common among judicial personnel. They mechanically manipulate "litigation procedures," speaking "legal language" all the time, scaring and fooling the people. Some are even so tyrannical as to be lawless. Among them, a common and particularly serious problem is handling cases without caring about political issues. Another is "subjective assumptions and sitting in court to interrogate," without following the mass line.

After these serious phenomena of impure organization and impure ideology and work style were exposed, the People's Courts at all levels made serious handling based on the policy of combining punishment and education and transformation and referring to the opinions of the broad masses, basically achieving the goal of purifying the organization. In order to strengthen the People's judicial work, more than 1,300 old cadres, demobilized soldiers, active workers and peasants, and young intellectuals have been transferred to participate in the work of the People's Courts throughout East China. Now the People's Courts in East China, which have completed organizational rectification, are preparing to further mobilize the masses inside and outside the organs to deeply and systematically carry out the struggle to eliminate old legal concepts and old judicial styles through the clearance of backlog cases and the reversal of wrongly judged cases.

The provinces and cities in North China are currently convening judicial conferences to carry out the judicial reform movement in a step-by-step manner. Party committees and People's Governments at all levels in North China began to pay attention to the problems existing in the People's judicial organs during the "Three-Anti" movement. Some counties in Pingyuan, Shanxi, and Chahar provinces, where problems were more serious, combined the "Three-Anti" movement to carry out various struggles and partial transformations of the phenomena of impure ideology and impure organization in the judicial departments. This spring, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China seized the incident of Zhang Shunyou, a cart worker, being obstructed by local judicial, public security, and other departments for accusing counter-revolutionary elements, and promoted the development of the anti-bureaucracy struggle in the entire region; it led all cadres to conduct an examination of their attitude towards the people's cause. Recently, Pingyuan Province used the serious violation of law and discipline by Wang Gaosheng, president of the Wenxian County People's Court, as a lesson to educate judicial cadres at all levels in the province, so that everyone deeply realized the importance of reforming judicial work.

In order to carry out the judicial reform movement in the entire region in a planned and step-by-step manner, the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council systematically analyzed these situations and problems in the judicial work of the entire region at the committee meeting held on July 21, put forward the guidelines and requirements for carrying out the judicial reform movement in the entire region, decided to allocate and train the necessary cadres, widely used typical examples for education, and widely opened up avenues of speech, strengthened the question office work of the judicial departments, to create favorable conditions for thoroughly transforming and rectifying judicial work. After the meeting, the North China Branch of the Supreme People's Court first established a Judicial Reform Office, and urged the provinces and cities to also establish this institution at the same time to strengthen the leadership of the judicial reform work. The method is to start with typical examples, gain experience, and then gradually promote it. In order to facilitate the rectification work, the courts at all levels will systematically collect the manifestations and harmful circumstances of old legal thoughts and styles in the past three years, summarize the good typical experiences in the People's judicial work, educate cadres and the people, and organize and plan to mobilize the people to inspect judicial work and judicial personnel. The North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council has also issued instructions to thoroughly rectify and transform judicial work, and will hold a judicial work symposium in the near future to summarize the problems exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement from the aspects of ideology, work style, system, and personnel, to facilitate the development of the movement. Now, the provinces and cities are convening judicial conferences to specifically formulate plans and steps to carry out the judicial reform movement in a deep and comprehensive manner.

    华东华北进行司法改革
    【本报讯】华东区和华北区展开司法改革运动。
    华东区司法改革工作，已有初步成绩；各级司法机关现正结合整顿组织，进一步系统地批判反动的旧法观点和旧司法作风。六月中旬以来，华东军政委员会和各省、市人民政府先后召开了政法工作会议或司法工作会议，讨论和布置了司法改革工作；会后即吸收有关的政法机关联合组成司法改革工作办公室，有领导有计划地展开司法改革工作。各级人民法院都贯彻了中央和华东党政领导机关指示的精神，第一阶段的组织整顿工作，一般都是结合思想整顿进行的，同时也正确地执行了内外夹攻、广泛发动群众的方针。华东各地的司法改革工作以福建、安徽和苏南等地作得最好。在具体作法上，一般是先组织人民法院的干部学文件，由法院的领导人带头联系文件进行思想检查，然后广泛发动群众大胆检举揭发。如安徽省蚌埠市人民法院就是首先召开了全体工作人员的大会，由司法改革工作办公室主任万立誉作学习动员报告，法院吴院长作检讨性的发言，然后各小组进行学习，联系文件精神进行自我检讨。这种作法对全院工作人员起了很大的启发教育作用，克服了部分干部对司法改革运动的许多不正确的看法。以后该市又召开了全市基层干部、宣传员和群众团体代表大会，以及工人、妇女、青年和诉讼当事人的小型会议，共有两万七千多人参加，收集到司法人员许多违法渎职的材料。这样既充分暴露了人民法院的各种严重问题，并使司法改革工作形成了群众性的运动。
    经过“三反”运动以来华东各级人民法院工作人员自己的检查，特别是广大群众的检举揭发，暴露了华东区人民司法机关存在着的严重问题。
    首先是组织不纯。有些司法机关的审判大权已为作恶多端的反动党、团、特务骨干和地主恶霸分子所篡夺。这些坏分子中间有伪“反省院”委员、特刑庭庭长、“戡乱条例”起草人、军统特务训练班指导员等等。
    反动的旧法观点和旧司法作风也相当严重。具有旧法观点的人，在处理反革命案件中敌我不分，把反革命分子和人民“平等”对待；对反革命分子的罪行，强调“时效”，主张“不咎既往”。在处理公私关系或劳资纠纷案件中，他们纵容不法资本家的
    “五毒”罪行及其非法压迫工人的行为。不法资本家盗骗国家资财，违反原订合约，被认作是国家机关、企业和不法资本家两个“法人”之间的纠纷，是“民事债务”。在处理婚姻和家庭纠纷的案件时，他们公然违背婚姻法，作封建婚姻制度、封建夫权的保护人。许多为争取婚姻自由权利而斗争的妇女，因此受到了意外的打击和迫害。
    旧司法作风在司法人员中表现得相当普遍。他们机械地搬弄“诉讼程序”，满嘴“法言”“法语”，吓唬和愚弄人民。更有的作威作福到无法无天的地步。其中普遍而特别严重的，一种是就案办案，不关心政治问题。另一种是“主观臆断，坐堂问案”，不走群众路线。
    这些严重的组织不纯和思想作风不纯的现象被揭露后，各级人民法院已根据惩办和教育改造相结合的政策并参照广大群众所提出的意见，作了严肃的处理，基本上达到了纯洁组织的目的。为了加强人民司法工作，华东全区已另抽调老干部、转业军人、工农积极分子、青年知识分子等一千三百多人参加人民法院的工作。现华东全区已完成组织整顿的人民法院，正准备通过清理积案和对错判案件的改判工作，进一步发动机关内外的群众，深入地系统地开展肃清旧法观点和旧司法作风的斗争。
    华北区各省、市目前正分别召开司法会议，有步骤地开展司法改革运动。华北各级党委和人民政府，在“三反”运动中就开始注意人民司法机关中存在的问题。平原、山西、察哈尔等省部分问题较严重的县份，曾结合“三反”运动，对司法部门的思想不纯、组织不纯的现象进行过各种斗争和部分改造。今春中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会抓紧处理赶车工人张顺有因控告反革命分子受到各地司法、公安等部门阻拦的事件，推动全区开展了反官僚主义的斗争；领导所有干部进行了一次对人民事业态度的检查。最近平原省又以前温县人民法院院长王高升的严重违法乱纪事件作借镜，在全省各级司法干部中进行教育，使大家深刻认识到改革司法工作的重要性。
    为了有计划有步骤地开展全区的司法改革运动，政务院华北行政委员会在七月二十一日召开的委务会议上，系统地分析了全区司法工作中的这些情况与问题，提出了在全区开展司法改革运动的方针和要求，决定调配与训练必要的干部；运用典型事例广泛进行教育；广开言路，加强司法部门的问事处工作，为彻底改造和整顿司法工作创造有利条件。会后，最高人民法院华北分院首先成立了司法改革办公室，并督促各省、市也同时建立这一机构，以加强对司法改革工作的领导。做法是从典型入手，取得经验，再逐步推广。为了便利整顿工作的进行，各级法院将有系统地搜集三年来旧法思想、作风的表现形式和危害情形，总结人民司法工作中好的典型经验，教育干部和人民，有组织有计划地发动人民群众检查司法工作和司法人员。政务院华北行政委员会也已发出彻底整顿与改造司法工作的指示，并将在最近召开司法工作座谈会，根据“三反”运动中暴露出来的问题，从思想上、作风上、制度上、人事上加以总结，以利运动的开展。现在各省、市正分别召开司法会议，具体拟定计划、步骤，深入全面地开展司法改革运动。
