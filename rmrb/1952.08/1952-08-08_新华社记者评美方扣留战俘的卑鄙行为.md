Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 7th: A special correspondent for this agency reports: The nearly eight months of discussion on the POW issue have proven that the U.S. side has consistently attempted to use prisoners of war as slaves for trading. The U.S. side has exhausted all despicable and barbaric means, trying to retain as many of our captured personnel as possible in this slave trade, as a price for the armistice. However, the U.S. chief representative Harrison shamelessly said to reporters on the 3rd of this month: "The United Nations cannot trade on prisoner of war numbers," and "We are dealing with a principle."

There is only one universally recognized principle for dealing with the issue of prisoners of war, which is the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. For nearly eight months, our side has unswervingly adhered to the principle of resolving the prisoner of war issue in accordance with the Geneva Convention, while the U.S. side has tried every possible means to undermine the principles of the Geneva Convention, which the U.S. government itself signed, and strived to detain as many of our captured personnel as possible.

When the prisoner of war issue began to be discussed on December 11 last year, our side put forward the principle of rapid repatriation of all prisoners of war after the armistice, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention. U.S. representative Libby immediately revealed their intention to use prisoners of war for trading. He eagerly requested the list of prisoners of war, saying that the U.S. side "cannot buy a pig in a poke." Because the U.S. side held more prisoners of war than our side, they put forward absurd proposals such as "one-for-one exchange" and "exchange of prisoners of war for civilians," blatantly attempting to treat prisoners of war as slaves and engage in human trafficking. After these absurd proposals failed, the U.S. side continued to insist on so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "non-forcible repatriation," fabricating so-called "screening results" of 70,000 and later revised to 83,000 people, hoping to use the name of prisoners of war "unwilling to be repatriated" to retain 20 percent of the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and 68 percent of the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the transaction.

Another despicable method used by the U.S. side to conduct this human trafficking was to simply omit the names of our captured personnel from the prisoner of war list. The U.S. side did not account for a total of 49,510 of our captured personnel. The vast majority of these prisoners of war were previously listed on the lists that the U.S. side had transferred to our side through the International Committee of the Red Cross, but they were simply omitted from the lists directly handed over to us by the U.S. side. In addition, the U.S. side even arbitrarily crossed out the names of prisoners of war already on the list, falsely claiming that they had "escaped," but in reality, they had been forced to serve as U.S. military agents.

In order to realize their barbaric human trafficking, U.S. generals persecuted and massacred our captured personnel whom they attempted to use for trading. Every clause of the Geneva Convention, which stipulates that prisoners of war should receive humane treatment, has been torn apart by U.S. military tanks and bayonets. According to the extremely incomplete materials revealed in the U.S. news reports alone, since mid-February of this year, the U.S. side has killed and injured more than 700 of our captured personnel in prisoner of war camps in Koje Island, Busan, Nonsan, and other places. The main executioner, Bonner, the U.S. military prisoner of war camp commander of Koje Island, has recently been promoted to major general by Clark for his "outstanding success" in massacring prisoners of war.

In addition, the Geneva Convention stipulates that prisoners of war should "enjoy respect for their person and honor," but the U.S. side forcibly tattooed more than 10,000 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and forged blood letters in the name of prisoners of war, expressing so-called "refusal to repatriate." What is particularly vicious is that the U.S. side forced many prisoners of war to serve as agents. These prisoners of war were forced to be transported to Tokyo for agent training, and then sent to Seoul to be incorporated into the U.S. military intelligence agency. Some of them were airdropped into our rear, and have reported in detail to our side the various crimes committed by the U.S. side against prisoners of war. The Geneva Convention also stipulates that prisoners of war should receive appropriate housing and food conditions. However, even U.S. reporters have repeatedly admitted in their reports that our captured personnel are crowded in "cage"-like wooden houses and tents, and admitted that Koje Island is an "island of terror." In order to force prisoners of war to accept so-called "screening," the U.S. side even cut off the food supply to prisoners of war several times, once cutting off the food supply to thousands of prisoners of war for as long as a week.

The U.S. side wants to use these bloody means to obliterate the prisoners of war's calls for home, so as to decorate their human trafficking as "humanitarian principles." This attempt has failed shamefully. The atrocities committed by the U.S. military against prisoners of war have aroused righteous condemnation from the people of the world.

Our side, which has always upheld the principles of the Geneva Convention, firmly advocates the repatriation of all foreign prisoners of war and all prisoners of war whose homes are in the original party's area, so that all prisoners of war can return home to live a peaceful life. Based on this truly humanitarian principle, our side has specifically proposed that the number of prisoners of war that the U.S. side should repatriate must be close to 116,000, including 20,000 captured personnel of the Volunteers. The U.S. side, which is losing ground, wants to use methods of refusing to negotiate, or even refusing to hold meetings, to force our side to accept its criminal demand to detain prisoners of war. However, Harrisons and others will sooner or later realize that the prisoner of war issue must be resolved in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention; American stock exchange-style fraudulent transactions will not work.

### 新华社记者评美方扣留战俘的卑鄙行为

    新华社记者评美方扣留战俘的卑鄙行为
    【新华社开城七日电】本社特派记者报道：将近八个月的战俘问题的讨论，证明美方一贯企图以战俘作奴隶交易。美方用尽一切卑鄙野蛮的手段，想在这奴隶交易中扣留尽可能多的我方被俘人员，作为停战的代价。而美方首席代表哈利逊竟还厚颜地在本月三日对记者说：“联合国不能在战俘数字上进行交易”，“我们是在处理一个原则”。
    处理战俘问题只有一个举世公认的原则，就是一九四九年关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约。将近八个月来，我方始终不渝地坚持按照日内瓦公约的原则解决战俘问题，而美方却千方百计地破坏美国政府自己签过字的日内瓦公约的原则，力图扣留尽可能多的我方被俘人员。
    当战俘问题在去年十二月十一日开始讨论时，我方就提出了符合日内瓦公约规定的停战后迅速遣返全体战俘的原则。美方代表李比立即透露了他们要用战俘进行交易的意图。他迫不及待地索取战俘名单，说美方“不能买一只装在袋里的猪”。因为美方收容的战俘比我方收容的多，他们就提出“一对
    一交换”，“战俘与平民交换”等荒谬主张，露骨地企图以战俘当作奴隶一样，进行人口买卖。在这些荒谬主张破产后，美方就继续坚持所谓“自愿遣返”与“不强迫遣返”，捏造七万人后来又改为八万三千人的所谓“甄别结果”，希图假借战俘“不愿遣返”之名，在交易中扣留百分之二十的朝鲜人民军被俘人员及百分之六十八的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。
    美方进行这种人口买卖的另一套卑鄙办法，是把我方被俘人员的名字根本从战俘名单上略去。共有四万九千五百一十名我方被俘人员，美方没有向我方作交代。这些战俘绝大部分曾列在美方过去经由红十字国际委员会转交我方的名单中，但在美方直接交给我方的名单中却根本被略去了。此外，美方甚至于把已经列在名单上的战俘名字任意涂去，谎称他们已经“逃亡”，而实际上他们已被强迫去充当美军特务。
    为了实现他们野蛮的人口买卖，美国将军们对被他们企图拿来作买卖的我方被俘人员进行了迫害与屠杀。规定战俘应受人道待遇的日内瓦公约，每一条款都已被美军的坦克与刺刀撕碎。仅据美方新闻报道中所透露的极不完全的材料，从今年二月中旬至今，美方在巨济岛、釜山、论山等战俘营中已杀死杀伤我方被俘人员七百多名。主要的刽子手、巨济岛美军战俘营营长波纳，因为他屠杀战俘的“卓越成功”最近已被克拉克提升为少将。
    此外，日内瓦公约规定战俘应“享受人身与荣誉之尊重”，但美方曾在一万多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员身上强行刺字，并假借战俘名义，伪造血书，表示所谓“拒绝遣返”。尤其毒辣的是美方强迫许多战俘充当特务。这些战俘被强迫运往东京受特务训练后，再被送到汉城编入美军特务机关。其中有些被空降到我后方后，已向我方详尽报告了美方对待战俘的种种罪行。日内瓦公约也规定战俘应得到适当的住所与饮食条件。但连美方记者在报道中也多次承认我方被俘人员都挤在“牢笼”似的木屋与帐篷中，并承认巨济岛是“恐怖之岛”。美方为了强迫战俘接受所谓“甄别”，甚至于曾几次断绝战俘的食粮，有一次竟对数千名战俘断绝食粮达一星期之久。
    美方想用这些血腥手段，抹煞战俘要求回家的呼声，以便把他们的人口买卖装饰成“人道原则”。这种企图是可耻地失败了。美军对战俘的暴行引起了全世界人民的正义声讨。
    一贯维护日内瓦公约原则的我方，坚决地主张遣返全部外籍战俘以及全部家在原属一方地区的战俘，让一切战俘都回家过和平生活。根据这个真正的人道原则，我方并具体提出美方应遣返的数字必须接近十一万六千，包括两万名志愿军被俘人员。理屈词穷的美方，想用拒不协商、甚至于拒不开会的办法来迫使我方接受其罪恶的扣留战俘的要求。但是，哈利逊之流迟早总会认识：战俘问题必须按照日内瓦公约的原则才能解决；美国证券交易所式的欺骗买卖是行不通的。
