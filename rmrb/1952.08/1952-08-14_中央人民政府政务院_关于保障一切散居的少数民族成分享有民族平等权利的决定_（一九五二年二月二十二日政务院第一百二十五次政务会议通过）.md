    Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
    on Guaranteeing the Right to National Equality for All Scattered Minority Nationalities
    (Passed at the 125th Government Administration Council Meeting on February 22, 1952)
    Due to various historical reasons, some minority nationalities in the country have lived scattered in Han areas for many years, even for several generations. Most of them live in cities and market towns. They have long suffered national oppression and discrimination under reactionary rule. Some have had to conceal their national origin, change their national identity, and hide their national characteristics in order to survive. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, national oppression has been abolished and national equality has been implemented. In order to guarantee the right to national equality for these scattered minority nationalities, the following decisions are made:
    1.  According to Articles 5 and 9 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all people of scattered minority nationalities shall enjoy the same rights as the local Han people in terms of freedom of thought, speech, publication, assembly, association, communication, personal freedom, residence, movement, religious belief, and demonstration. No one shall discriminate against them.
    2.  All scattered minority nationalities shall enjoy the right to vote and to stand for election in accordance with the law. Where there are a relatively large number of them, the local people's government may take appropriate measures to enable them to have representatives participate in the organs of political power; proposals and opinions concerning minority nationalities shall be given the same importance as proposals and opinions from other quarters; special issues concerning a particular minority nationality must be fully consulted with representatives of that minority nationality.
    3.  All scattered minority nationalities shall have the right to freely maintain or reform their national way of life, religious beliefs, and customs, whether in society, in factories, schools, organizations, institutions, or the armed forces. Others shall not interfere and must respect and take care of them.
    4.  All scattered minority nationalities shall have the right to join various local people's organizations and participate in various occupations. People's organizations and occupational sectors shall not refuse or discriminate against them because of their national identity.
    5.  Any scattered minority nationality that has its own national language and script may conduct litigation in its own national language and script in court.
    6.  All scattered minority nationalities shall have the right to appeal to the people's government if they suffer from national discrimination, oppression, or insult. People's governments at all levels shall be responsible for handling such appeals; those who commit serious acts of discrimination, oppression, or insult shall be punished according to law.
    7.  All scattered minority nationalities may request appropriate assistance from the local people's government if they encounter difficulties in enjoying their rights to national equality that cannot be resolved.
    8.  The principles of this decision shall also apply to other minority nationalities and Han nationalities scattered in various minority autonomous regions.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于保障一切散居的少数民族成分享有民族平等权利的决定
    （一九五二年二月二十二日政务院第一百二十五次政务会议通过）
    由于各种的历史原因，国内某些少数民族成分，在好多年以来，甚至在好几代以来，即星散地居住在汉族地区。他们大多居住在城市和集镇。他们曾经在反动统治下长期地忍受着民族的压迫和歧视，有的因此不得不隐瞒自己的民族出身，改变自己的民族成分，遮盖自己的民族特点，以求生存。中华人民共和国创立以后，民族压迫业已宣告废除，民族平等业已付诸实施，为保障这些散居的少数民族成分享有民族平等的权利，特作如下的决定：
    一、依据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第五条和第九条的规定，一切散居的少数民族成分的人民，均与当地汉族人民同样享有思想、言论、出版、集会、结社、通讯、人身、居住、迁徙、宗教信仰、游行示威的自由权，任何人不得加以歧视。
    二、一切散居的少数民族成分，依法享有选举权与被选举权。其人数较多者，当地人民政府可采取适当办法，使有代表参加政权机关；遇有关少数民族的提案和意见，应与其他方面的提案和意见同样予以重视；有关某一少数民族的特殊问题，须与该少数民族代表充分协商。
    三、一切散居的少数民族成分，无论在社会上，在工厂、学校、团体、机关和部队中，均有自由保持或改革其民族的生活方式、宗教信仰和风俗习惯的权利，别人不得干涉，并须加以尊重和照顾。
    四、一切散居的少数民族成分，有分别加入当地各种人民团体及参加各种职业的权利，各人民团体及各种职业部门，不得因其民族成分的关系而加以拒绝或歧视。
    五、凡散居的少数民族成分，有其本民族语言、文字者，得在法庭上以本民族语言、文字进行诉辩。
    六、一切散居的少数民族成分如遭受民族的歧视、压迫或侮辱，有向人民政府控告的权利。各级人民政府对此种控告须负责予以处理；对于歧视、压迫或侮辱行为严重者，应依法予以惩治。
    七、一切散居的少数民族成分，在享受民族平等权利遇有困难无法解决时，得提请当地人民政府予以适当帮助。
    八、本决定的原则同样适用于散居在各少数民族自治区的其他少数民族成分和汉族成分。
