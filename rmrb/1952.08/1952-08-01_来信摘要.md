Peasants with self-production and self-sales permits who transport and sell their own products should not be treated as itinerant merchants.

    Wang Yutang, from Taojiang County, Hunan Province, reports that some peasants engage in the sideline of making writing brushes. Every spring and autumn, these peasants transport their brushes to Guizhou, Xikang, Sichuan, and other places to sell. They face many unreasonable restrictions in the sales areas. For example, Daozhen County in Guizhou Province does not allow peasants with self-production and self-sales permits to sell goods, and insists on requiring them to obtain itinerant merchant permits. Some places in eastern Sichuan insist on requiring peasants to obtain peddler permits, and stipulate that peasants with itinerant merchant permits can only make transactions of more than one hundred brushes. This situation affects the peasants' enthusiasm for operating sideline production, and they hope the People's Daily will help solve this problem.
    
    Editor's note: The Interim Regulations on the Management of Itinerant Merchants promulgated by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government stipulate that producers of household sideline products who sell their own products should not be treated as itinerant merchants. Therefore, local people's governments should educate peasants holding self-production and self-sales permits to obey the management of the local industrial and commercial administrative departments, and should not require them to obtain itinerant merchant permits or peddler permits. For those holding itinerant merchant permits, local governments should educate them to abide by the market management regulations of the place where the goods are purchased and sold, and in principle, should not restrict their business scope. We have forwarded the situation reflected by reader Wang Yutang to the Trade Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee. They have notified the relevant areas to solve this problem.

Correct the Bad Habit of Coloring Food

    I am the manager of a food shop in Zhangjiakou City. In the past, in order to make food look good and easy to sell, we would dye it with colors during production. Most of these colors were poisonous. Although the toxicity was very low, it was still bad for customers' health. After the education of the "Five-Anti" movement, we food merchants in Zhangjiakou City decided to correct this behavior of harming others and benefiting ourselves. Starting in April, all the pastries, popsicles, and even smoked chicken made in the city were not colored. When customers learned that the colors were poisonous, they also supported our approach. As a result, it was beneficial to customers. The cost of the food we made was reduced, and the turnover also increased. Therefore, I suggest that food manufacturers across the country get rid of the practice of coloring food.
    Xu Yuting

    Editor's note: In order to solve the problem of food coloring, we have separately solicited opinions from the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government. They both believe that the suggestion made by reader Xu Yuting is correct. We hope that local federations of industry and commerce will lead and help food manufacturers to correct the bad practice of food coloring.

A 20-Year-Old Illness Cured for Free

    I am an old woman in my seventies. I ask the People's Daily to tell everyone what is in my heart. Twenty-five years ago, I developed a tumor in my stomach, which was initially the size of a small basin, and later the size of a pot. In the old society, I was a poor and lonely old woman, no one cared for me, and I had no money for treatment, so I suffered for more than 20 years.
    This March, a people's policeman came to my home. He saw my painful situation and reported it to the People's Government. The People's Government sent me to the Beijing Municipal Third Hospital for free treatment. In the hospital, the doctors and nurses were very kind to me, and my life was very satisfactory. In just two weeks, the root of my illness for more than 20 years was removed.
    I want to thank the people's police, doctors, and nurses, and I thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao even more. Without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could my illness be cured!

The Number of Students from Hebei Provincial Beijing Normal Summer School Staying at School to Receive Stipends Should Be Increased

    We are students of the Hebei Provincial Beijing Normal School. This year, more than 80 students in our school applied to stay at school during the summer vacation to receive people's stipends. After repeated review by the school, more than 60 people were selected. However, the Hebei Provincial Department of Culture and Education only approved 21 people. After the school applied again, 25 people were finally approved. Excluding the three people who need to stay at school due to the work of the Communist Youth League and the Student Union, and the 13 people in the middle school class who enjoy fixed people's stipends, the actual quota is only nine people. According to the school's investigation: there are 18 students who have no home to return to and have no other source of income; although there are families, there are still many students who have financial difficulties. This situation has affected the learning mood of many students. We hope that the Hebei Provincial Department of Culture and Education will reconsider this issue.
    Cai Qinchang, Liaoyuan

    Editor's note: According to our newspaper's investigation, the situation reflected by readers Cai Qinchang and Liaoyuan in their letters is indeed true. We hope that the Hebei Provincial Department of Culture and Education will, in accordance with the spirit of the Government Administration Council's Notice on Adjusting People's Stipends for Students in National Universities and Secondary Schools, which states that "the people's stipends for schools at all levels and types should be aimed at appropriately solving students' food and other practical material difficulties," reconsider the quota of students in Beijing Normal School who stay at school during the summer vacation to receive stipends based on the actual situation of Beijing Normal School.

It Is Recommended That Publishing Houses Include a Brief Introduction of the Book's Contents at the Beginning of New Books

    Librarians have a responsibility to introduce new books to readers, but due to limited abilities, it is impossible to read all the books in the library. Therefore, we suggest that publishing houses include a brief and concise introduction of the contents at the beginning of new books when publishing them. This will not only make it easier for librarians to introduce new books to readers, but also be helpful to readers.

专栏：来信摘要

    持有自产自销证的农民运销自制产品可不作行商论
    湖南省桃江县有一部分农民从事制造毛笔的副业。每年春秋两季，这些农民把毛笔运到贵州、西康、四川等地出卖。他们在销地受到很多不合理的限制。例如，贵州道真县不许持有自产自销证的农民销货，硬向他们要行商证。川东区某些地方硬向农民要小贩证，并规定持有行商证的农民只能做一百支毛笔以上的交易。这种情况影响了农民经营副业生产的情绪，希望人民日报协助解决这个问题。
    王玉堂
    编者按：中央人民政府贸易部颁布的行商管理暂行通则规定：家庭副业生产者出售其自产品，可不作行商论。因此，对持有自产自销证的农民，各地人民政府应该教育他们服从销地工商行政部门的管理，而不应向他们要行商证或小贩证。对持有行商证者，各地政府应该教育他们遵守购销货物所在地的市场管理法规，原则上亦不应限制其业务范围。我们已把读者王玉堂反映的情况，转告西南军政委员会贸易部。他们已通知有关地区解决这个问题。
    改正食品染色的不良习惯
    我是张家口市一家食品铺的经理。过去我们为了使食品好看，便于销售，就在制作时染上颜色。这些颜色大部有毒。虽然毒性很小，对顾客的健康总是不好的。经过“五反”运动的教育，我们张家口市食品商决定改正这种损人利己的行为。从四月开始，全市制作的糕点、冰棍甚至熏鸡，都不染色了。顾客们知道了颜色是有毒的，也都支持我们的做法。这样做的结果，对顾客是有利的。我们制作的食品减低了成本，营业额也提高了。因此，我建议全国各地食品厂商都改掉食品染色的作法。
    徐玉亭
    编者按：为了解决食品染色的问题，我们曾经分别征求了中央人民政府轻工业部和卫生部的意见。他们都认为读者徐玉亭提出的建议是正确的。希望各地工商业联合会有领导地帮助食品厂商改正食品染色的不良做法。
    二十多年的老病免费治好
    我是一个七十多岁的老婆婆。我要求人民日报把我心里的话告诉给大家。在二十五年前，我肚子里生了一个瘤，起初有小盆大，后来有锅那样大。在旧社会里，我这个又穷又孤的老婆子，没人照顾，更没钱治病，就这样受了二十多年的罪。
    今年三月，一位人民警察到我家里。他看见我这种痛苦的情形，就报告了人民政府。人民政府把我送到北京市立第三医院免费治疗。在医院里，医生、护士对我都很好，生活也很称心。只有两个星期，就把我这二十多年的病根子取出来了。
    我要感谢人民警察、医生和护士，我更感谢共产党和毛主席。没有共产党和毛主席的领导，我这病那能治好呢！

    河北省立北京师范暑期留校学生享受助学金待遇的名额应增加
    我们是河北省立北京师范学校的学生。我校同学今年申请在暑期留校享受人民助学金待遇的共有八十多人，后经学校多次审核，决定了六十几人。但河北省文教厅只批准了二十一人。经学校再次申请，最后批准了二十五人。除去由于青年团、学生会工作需要留校的三人和中学班享受固定人民助学金的十三人以外，实际名额就只有九个人了。据校方调查：学生中无家可归而又别无生活来源的，就有十八人；虽有家庭但生活困难的还有许多人。这个情况已经影响了很多同学的学习情绪。希望河北省文教厅重新考虑这个问题。
    蔡秦昌  燎原
    编者按：据本报调查，读者蔡秦昌、燎原在来信中反映的情况是确实的。希望河北省文教厅按照政务院关于调整全国高等学校及中等学校学生人民助学金的通知中“各级各类学校的人民助学金应以适当地解决学生的伙食和其他实际的物质困难为目的”的精神，根据北京师范学校的实际情况，重新考虑该校暑期留校享受人民助学金待遇的学生的名额。
    建议出版机关出版新书时在卷首简单介绍书籍内容
    图书馆工作者有责任向读者介绍新书，但因能力限制，不可能把全馆的书籍尽数读完。因此我们建议各出版机关在出版新书时，把内容简单扼要地在卷首介绍一下。这样不但便于图书馆工作者向读者介绍新书，对读者也同样是有帮助的。
