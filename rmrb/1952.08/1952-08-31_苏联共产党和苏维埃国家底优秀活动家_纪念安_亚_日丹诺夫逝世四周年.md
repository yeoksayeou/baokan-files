    Outstanding Activist of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet State
    —Commemorating the Fourth Anniversary of the Death of A.A. Zhdanov
    Soviet Union  A. Zhubarev
    Editor's Note: Today marks the fourth anniversary of the death of Comrade Zhdanov, a leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and an outstanding activist in the international communist movement. Zhdanov's reports on literature, art, and philosophy made important contributions to Marxist-Leninist theoretical work. Our literary, artistic, philosophical, and other ideological workers should draw new strength from Comrade Zhdanov's theoretical work to improve their own work.
    Four years ago, on August 31, 1948, the heart of a passionate fighter for communism, a loyal son of the Leninist-Stalinist party and the Soviet state, and an outstanding activist, Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov, stopped beating.
    A loyal student and comrade of the great Stalin, A.A. Zhdanov consciously dedicated his entire life to his party, to his people, and to all advanced and progressive humanity. He was a passionate fighter for the realization of the great ideas of Marx and Lenin, striving for the victory of communism. A.A. Zhdanov earned the love of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet people, and all advanced and progressive humanity because of his boundless loyalty to the cause of the Leninist-Stalinist party and the cause of building communism.
    A.A. Zhdanov was born on February 26, 1896, in the city of Mariupol (now Zhdanov) to the family of a school superintendent. He witnessed the tyranny of the Tsarist autocracy and the poverty, hunger, and powerlessness of the workers and peasants of Tsarist Russia. In his youth, he became interested in various phenomena of social life, especially the revolutionary movement. In 1912, when he was still a student at the Tver Industrial School, he founded a group to study social democratic thought within the school and read the Bolshevik "Pravda," founded by Stalin under Lenin's instructions—this newspaper gathered revolutionary forces around itself and pointed out the direction for activities among workers and peasants. At the end of November 1915, A.A. Zhdanov joined the Bolshevik Party and actively carried out party work in the workers' district of Tver. In March 1916, at a conference of party activists, he was elected as a member of the Tver City Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks).
    After A.A. Zhdanov was conscripted into the Tsarist army, he carried out Bolshevik propaganda and agitation among the soldiers. In 1917, while in the city of Shadrinsk, he actively participated in the work of preparing and realizing the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Urals. During the period of foreign armed intervention and the civil war, A.A. Zhdanov served in political education work in the Red Army and guided party and Soviet work in the Urals and Tver.
    In the years when the Soviet state transitioned to the peaceful work of restoring and developing the national economy, A.A. Zhdanov, as a Bolshevik leader and organizer of the masses, engaged in selfless labor in various areas of party and Soviet construction, waging an uncompromising struggle for the general line of the Leninist-Stalinist party. From 1922, Zhdanov was the chairman of the Executive Committee of the Tver Provincial Soviet of Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Deputies. From 1924 to 1934, he served as the secretary of the Gorky Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and later as the secretary of the party's regional committee. Holding high the banner of Bolshevik partisanship, he vigorously upheld the communist ideological position and paid close attention to practical economic construction. In December 1925, at the Fourteenth Party Congress, A.A. Zhdanov was elected as a candidate member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). During this period, Zhdanov joined the leading core of the Bolshevik Party led by Stalin, which waged an uncompromising struggle against those who lacked firm conviction and capitulators, Trotskyites, Zinovievites, and Bukharinites, preserving the great banner of Lenin, uniting the party around Lenin's legacy, guiding the Soviet people onto the broad road of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and ensuring the construction of socialism within the Soviet Union.
    In July 1930, at the Sixteenth Party Congress, A.A. Zhdanov was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and after the Seventeenth Party Congress in January 1934, he was promoted to secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and candidate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). During this period, Zhdanov carried out major tasks on behalf of the party and the state, focusing with great attention on the theoretical issues of Marxism-Leninism and the development of historical science and socialist culture.
    In December 1934, after the assassination of S.M. Kirov by Trotskyite thugs, the party sent Zhdanov to Leningrad, where he led the party organization for ten years (from 1934 to 1944). With his inherent Bolshevik enthusiasm, he inspired and guided the Bolsheviks of Leningrad to ruthlessly strike and eliminate the remnants of Trotskyite-Zinovievite spies, assassins, and murderers, as well as traitors and double-dealers of the motherland. He mobilized the Bolsheviks of Leningrad to raise their ideological and political level and Bolshevik vigilance, making them more closely united around the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Comrade Stalin.
    On the eve of the Eighteenth Party Congress, Comrade Stalin and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) appointed A.A. Zhdanov to lead all propaganda and agitation work of the party. In March 1939, Zhdanov was elected as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).
    During the years of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, A.A. Zhdanov, entrusted by the party and the Soviet government, carried out the enormous work of organizing the defense of Leningrad against the invasion of the German fascist bandits. Zhdanov directly led the practical implementation of Stalin's brilliant plan to defeat the Hitlerite bandits under Leningrad.
    After the victory of the Great Patriotic War, when the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet people turned to peaceful construction, Zhdanov paid great attention to the implementation of J.V. Stalin's instructions and the party's resolutions on carrying out ideological work in the country and on the communist education of the Soviet people. His brilliant reports on literature, art, and philosophy were important contributions to the development of Marxist-Leninist theory, and these reports pointed out the path for the future development of socialist culture in the Soviet Union.
    Zhdanov criticized the serious shortcomings on the literary front—the lack of ideology, lack of principle, and apolitical attitude of individual writers, and the abject manifestations in the face of decadent bourgeois culture. He comprehensively elucidated the major tasks facing Soviet writers. A.A. Zhdanov pointed out the constant concern of the party and Comrade Stalin personally for creating a rich spiritual culture in the Soviet Union. He determined the position and significance of Soviet literature and art in the ideological and political work of the Communist Party, and called on Soviet writers to always adhere to the Bolshevik principle of partisanship in literature and to create highly artistic works that educate Soviet youth with the great spirit of communist ideas and Soviet patriotism.
    A.A. Zhdanov especially emphasized that Soviet writers and all workers on the ideological front must pay attention to launching a relentless struggle against the slander spread by the reactionary imperialists against the Soviet Union and socialism. He called on all workers on the ideological front to "not only refute the malicious slander and attacks of the reactionaries against our Soviet culture and socialism, but also to boldly criticize the bourgeois culture that is in a state of weakness and corruption."
    A.A. Zhdanov's speech at the philosophical discussion meeting in June 1947 was of great significance to all aspects of ideological work. In this speech, Zhdanov exposed all the serious shortcomings on the philosophical front, gave a scientific, Marxist-Leninist definition of the object of the history of philosophy, determined the basic principles for establishing a Marxist history of philosophy, and pointed out the path for raising the level of work in the field of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. Zhdanov called on Soviet philosophers: "To lead the ranks of ideological workers, to fully apply Marxist epistemology in summarizing the vast experience of socialist construction and solving new problems of socialism... to boldly advance the theory of Soviet society, the theory of the Soviet state, the theory of modern natural science, ethics, and aesthetics."
    Zhdanov sharply criticized objectivism, apoliticism, and the attitude of servile flattery towards bourgeois philosophy, denounced the phenomena of neglecting modern themes, and called on Soviet philosophers to boldly launch criticism and self-criticism, and to wage a resolute offensive struggle against bourgeois ideology. Zhdanov fully pointed out that "the question of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism is not only a practical question for our philosophers, but also a profound theoretical question."
    "In our Soviet society," Zhdanov said, "antagonistic classes have been eliminated, so the struggle between the new and the old, the development from lower to higher, is not manifested in the form of struggles between antagonistic classes and sudden changes (as in bourgeois society), but in the form of criticism and self-criticism, which is the real driving force of our development, the powerful tool grasped by the party, and undoubtedly a new form of movement, a new form of development, a new dialectical regularity."
    In January 1948, at the conference of Soviet musicians convened by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) under Zhdanov's leadership, the speech he delivered was of great significance for exploring and enriching Marxist-Leninist theory and further developing socialist culture and art in the Soviet Union. In this speech, he exposed the anti-people tendency of formalism in music, condemned this tendency's contempt for the excellent traditions of Russian classical music and Russian classical opera, and exposed the manifestations of incompatible bourgeois influences in music. A.A. Zhdanov said: "Whoever thinks that the prosperity of Russian national music or the music of the various Soviet nationalities that have joined the Soviet Union means a reduction in internationalism in art is making a serious mistake. Internationalism in art is not born on the basis of reducing national art and impoverishing it. On the contrary, internationalism is born in the place where national art prospers. To forget this truth means losing the line of leadership, losing one's own identity, and becoming a rootless cosmopolitan. Only a nation that possesses its own highly developed musical culture can appreciate the musical resources of other nations. A person who does not truly love his motherland cannot become an internationalist in the field of music, just as in all other fields. If the basis of internationalism is respect for other nations, then a person who does not respect his own nation cannot become an internationalist."
    A.A. Zhdanov was the most talented propagandist of the great ideas of Lenin and Stalin.
    As one of the most outstanding activists of the international workers' movement, Zhdanov made great contributions to the cause of uniting democratic forces to fight against the reactionary camp of imperialism. In his many speeches, he brilliantly elucidated the most important issues of the international situation and the world revolutionary movement. In his report at the conference of representatives of several communist parties in September 1947, Zhdanov made a profound analysis of the post-war world situation, clearly explained the new configuration of political forces, and exposed the "Marshall Plan" as a plan by US imperialism to economically and politically enslave Europe.
    A.A. Zhdanov exposed the right-wing socialists as servants of the American imperialists. He pointed out the greatness of the Stalinist program for the struggle for peace, freedom, and national independence, and called on democratic forces to wage a selfless struggle against the new warmongers of the United States and Britain. He said: "It must be noted that the desire of the imperialists to launch a new war is one thing, while the possibility of actually launching such a war is quite another—the distance between the two is very, very far. The people of all countries in the world do not want war to happen. The forces standing on the side of peace are so strong that as long as these forces can persevere in the cause of defending peace, as long as they show full determination and toughness, the aggressors' plans can be completely bankrupt."
    A.A. Zhdanov's speeches are a brilliant example of creative Marxism. These speeches demonstrate how he combined revolutionary practice and revolutionary theory in an amazing way.
    A.A. Zhdanov's life and activities are an example of passionate struggle for the cause of Lenin and Stalin, for the cause of communism.

    苏联共产党和苏维埃国家底优秀活动家
    ——纪念安·亚·日丹诺夫逝世四周年
    苏联  阿·朱巴烈夫
    编者按：今天是苏联共产党领袖和国际共产主义运动杰出活动家日丹诺夫同志逝世四周年的日子。日丹诺夫的关于文学、艺术和哲学诸问题的报告，对马克思列宁主义的理论工作有重要贡献。我国文学、艺术、哲学及其他思想工作者都应该从日丹诺夫同志的理论工作中汲取新的力量，来改进自己的工作。
    四年前，一九四八年八月三十一日，共产主义的热情战士、列宁斯大林党和苏维埃国家的忠实儿子、优秀活动家安得烈·亚历山大维奇·日丹诺夫的心停止跳动了。
    伟大斯大林的忠诚学生和战友安·亚·日丹诺夫自觉地把自己的全部生命都献给了自己的党，献给了自己的人民和所有先进的与进步的人类。他是一位为实现马克思、列宁主义伟大思想、争取为共产主义胜利的热情战士。安·亚·日丹诺夫由于自己对列宁、斯大林党的事业和建设共产主义事业的无限忠诚而博得了布尔什维克党、苏维埃人民和所有先进的与进步的人类的爱戴。
    安·亚·日丹诺夫在一八九六年二月二十六日诞生于玛黎乌鲍里城（现日丹诺夫市）的一个学校督学的家庭里。他看到了沙皇专制制度的横暴，看到了沙皇俄国工农们的贫困、饥饿和无权，他在青年时代就对社会生活的各种现象，尤其对革命运动发生了兴趣。在一九一二年当他还是特维里城实业学校学生的时候，他就在校内创立了学习社会民主思想的小组，读到了遵照列宁指示由斯大林所创办的布尔什维克的“真理报”——这个报纸把革命力量集合在自己的周围并为它指出在工人和农民中进行活动的方向。在一九一五年十一月末，安·亚·日丹诺夫加入了布尔什维克党，在特维里城工人区中积极地进行了党的工作。一九一六年三月在党的积极分子大会上，他被推选为俄国社会民主工党（布尔什维克）特维里市委员会委员。
    在安·亚·日丹诺夫被征募入沙皇的军队中后，他在兵士中进行了布尔什维克的宣传和鼓动。一九一七年在沙德林斯克城的时候，他积极参加了乌拉尔的准备和实现伟大十月社会主义革命的工作。在外国武装干涉和国内战争时期，安·亚·日丹诺夫担任了在红军中的政治教育工作，并在乌拉尔和特维里指导党和苏维埃的工作。
    在苏维埃国家转到恢复与发展国民经济的和平工作的年月里，作为布尔什维克的领导者和群众的组织者的安·亚·日丹诺夫，在党和苏维埃建设的不同地区内进行了忘我的劳动，为列宁、斯大林党底总路线进行了不妥协的斗争。从一九二二年起，日丹诺夫是特维里省工农兵代表苏维埃执行委员会主席。在一九二四——一九三四年间他担任过联共（布）党高尔基省委员会书记，继后，又担任党的边区委员会书记。他高举着布尔什维克党性的旗帜，奋励地坚持着共产主义的思想立场，深刻地注意着实际的经济建设事业。在一九二五年十二月，第十四次党代表大会上，安·亚·日丹诺夫被选为联共（布）党中央委员会的候补委员。在这个时期中，日丹诺夫加入了斯大林所领导的布尔什维克党的领导核心，这个领导核心曾对信心不坚者和投降分子、托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子、布哈林分子进行了毫不妥协的斗争，并保全了伟大的列宁旗帜，把党团结在列宁遗训的周围，引导苏联人民踏上国家工业化和农业集体化的康庄大道，确保了在苏联国内社会主义的建设。
    一九三○年七月在第十六次党代表大会上，安·亚·日丹诺夫被选为联共（布）党中央委员会委员，而在一九三四年一月第十七次党代表大会之后，又被推选为联共（布）党中央委员会书记兼联共（布）党中央委员会政治局候补委员。在这时期，日丹诺夫执行了党和国家方面的重大工作，他以极大的注意力集中于马克思列宁主义理论问题和发展历史科学及社会主义文化的问题上。
    一九三四年十二月，谢·米·基洛夫被托洛茨基凶徒阴谋暗杀之后，党就派日丹诺夫到列宁格勒去，他曾在那里领导党组织工作达十年之久（从一九三四——一九四四年）。他以其所固有的布尔什维克的热情，鼓舞和指导列宁格勒城的布尔什维克们去无情地打击和消灭托洛茨基——季诺维也夫的特务、暗害分子和杀人犯以及祖国的叛徒、两面派分子的残余，他动员列宁格勒城布尔什维克们来提高思想政治水平和布尔什维克的警惕性，使他们更加紧密地团结在联共（布）党中央委员会和斯大林同志的周围。
    在第十八次党代表大会的前夜，斯大林同志和联共（布）党中央委员会委任安·亚·日丹诺夫领导全党的一切宣传鼓动工作。在一九三九年三月，日丹诺夫被选为联共（布）党中央委员会政治局委员。
    在苏联伟大卫国战争年代，安·亚·日丹诺夫奉了党和苏联政府的委托，进行了组织保卫列宁格勒免受德国法西斯匪徒侵犯的巨大工作。日丹诺夫直接领导了在列宁格勒城下击灭希特勒匪徒的斯大林天才计划的实际执行。
    在伟大卫国战争胜利之后，当布尔什维克党和苏维埃人民转向和平建设的时期，日丹诺夫对于实现约·维·斯大林的指示和关于开展国内思想工作以及关于苏维埃人民的共产主义教育的党的决议的事情，寄予巨大的注意。他的关于文学、艺术与哲学诸问题的光辉的报告是马克思主义与列宁主义理论发展中的重要贡献，这些报告指出了今后在苏联国内社会主义文化发展的途径。
    日丹诺夫对于在文学战线上的严重缺点——对于个别文学家的缺乏思想性、缺乏原则性、不问政治的态度和在颓废的资产阶级文化面前的卑劣性的表现给予了批评，他全面地阐明了苏联作家面临的重大任务。安·亚·日丹诺夫指出了党和斯大林同志个人对于在苏联国内创造丰富的精神文化的不断关怀，他确定了苏联文学和艺术在共产党思想政治工作中的地位及意义，并号召苏联作家们要时时刻刻遵守在文学中的布尔什维克的党性原则，要创造教育苏联青年具有共产主义伟大思想精神和苏维埃爱国主义精神的高度艺术作品。
    安·亚·日丹诺夫特别强调苏联作家和一切思想战线的工作者必须注意向帝国主义反动派对苏联和社会主义所散布的毁谤，展开无情的斗争。他号召一切思想战线的工作者们，“不仅要给予反动派对我们苏联文化和社会主义的恶毒毁谤和攻讦以还击，而且要大胆地抨击处在虚弱和腐败状态中的资产阶级文化。”
    安·亚·日丹诺夫在一九四七年六月于哲学讨论会上发表的演说，对于思想工作的各方面都有着重大意义。日丹诺夫在这篇演说中，揭发了在哲学战线上的所有的严重缺点，给哲学史的对象下了科学的、马克思—列宁主义的定义，确定了建立马克思主义哲学史的基本原则，并指出了提高马克思—列宁主义哲学领域中的工作水平的道路。日丹诺夫号召苏联哲学家们：“领导思想战线工作者的队伍，在总结社会主义建设的巨大经验和解决社会主义新的问题时，要充分地应用马克思主义的认识论……要大胆地把苏维埃社会的理论、苏维埃国家的理论、现代自然科学的理论、伦理学和美学向前推进。”
    日丹诺夫尖锐地批评了客观主义、不问政治和在资产阶级哲学面前奴颜婢膝的态度，斥责了那些轻视现代主题的现象，他号召苏联哲学家们大胆地展开批评与自我批评，要为反对资产阶级思想进行坚决地进攻性的斗争。日丹诺夫全力指出，“关于布尔什维克批评和自我批评的问题，对于我们哲学家不仅是一个实践问题，而且是一个深刻的理论问题。”
    “在我们苏维埃社会，”日丹诺夫说，“已经消灭了互相对抗的阶级，因此新与旧之间的斗争，从低级到高级的发展，不是像资本主义制度下那样表现在对抗阶级和急变的斗争形式中，不是表现在社会生活激剧破坏的变革中（如像资产阶级社会那样），而是表现在批评和自我批评的形式中，这就是我们发展的真正动力，这就是党所掌握的强大的工具，这无疑是新的运动形式，新的发展形式，新的辩证规律性。”
    一九四八年一月在日丹诺夫领导下于联共（布）党中央委员会召开的苏联音乐家会议上，他所发表的演说，对于发掘和丰富马克思、列宁主义理论和进一步发展苏联国内社会主义文化及艺术，具有重要的意义。他在这篇演说中揭发了音乐中形式主义的反人民的倾向，并谴责了这种倾向对俄罗斯古典音乐和俄国古典歌剧优秀传统的蔑视，揭发了音乐中的格格不入的资产阶级影响的表现。安·亚·日丹诺夫说：“谁以为俄罗斯民族音乐或者是加入苏联的各苏维埃民族的音乐的兴旺，就表示是缩小了艺术中的国际主义，那就犯了重大的错误。艺术中的国际主义并不是诞生在缩小民族艺术和使其贫乏的基础上。正相反，国际主义是诞生在民族艺术兴旺的地方。忘记这条真理——就表示是丧失领导路线，丧失自己的面目，成为孤寡无亲的世界主义者。只有那拥有着自己高度发展的音乐文化的民族，才能评价其他民族的音乐富源。不是真正热爱自己祖国的人就不能成为音乐领域中的国际主义者，像其他一切领域中的情形一样，如果说，国际主义的基础是尊敬其他民族，那么不敬爱自己的民族的人，就不能成为国际主义者。”
    安·亚·日丹诺夫曾是列宁与斯大林的伟大思想的最有才干的宣传家。
    作为最伟大的国际工人运动的活动家之一的日丹诺夫对于团结民主力量向帝国主义反动阵营进行斗争的事业给予了极大贡献。他在自己许多演说中光辉地阐明了国际形势及世界革命运动最重大的问题。日丹诺夫在一九四七年九月几国共产党代表会议上发表的报告中曾对战后世界局势作了深刻分析，他极明确地说明了政治力量的新配置情况，并揭穿了“马歇尔计划”是美帝国主义在经济和政治上奴役欧洲的计划。
    安·亚·日丹诺夫揭露了右翼社会党人是美帝国主义者的仆从，他指出了为争取和平、自由和民族独立而斗争底斯大林纲领的伟大性，并号召民主力量向美英两国新战争贩子们进行奋不顾身的斗争。他说：“必须注意到，帝国主义者想发动新战争的愿望是一回事，而真正举行这种战争的可能性，却完全是另一回事——这中间的距离是相隔得很远很远的。世界各国人民都不愿有战争发生。站在和平方面的势力如此强大，只要这种势力在捍卫和平事业上能坚持到底，只要他们表现出充分的坚定和强硬精神，就能使侵略者底计划遭到完全的破产。”
    安·亚·日丹诺夫的演说——是创造性的马克思主义的光辉典范。在这些演说中说明了他把革命的实践和革命的理论是如何惊人地结合起来。
    安·亚·日丹诺夫的生平与活动——就是为列宁、斯大林事业、为共产主义事业而热烈斗争的范例。
