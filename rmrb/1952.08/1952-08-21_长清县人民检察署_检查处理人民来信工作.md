    Changqing County People's Procuratorate
    Inspects and Handles Letters from the People

    To the Editor: In the article "Suggestion to the Changqing County People's Government to Inspect the Handling of Letters from the People," published in the People's Daily on July 17, our office was mentioned as having the error of backlog of letters. This suggestion is correct, and we have already conducted an inspection.

    In the past, we did not sufficiently recognize the importance of handling letters from the people, treating it as a general task (of course, all work should be done well). Our attitude towards handling letters from the people was also dishonest. If it was a letter from the people forwarded by a higher authority (or newspaper), we would pay more attention and handle it more quickly, because we were afraid of inspection, criticism, or even punishment from the higher authorities. However, we did not pay attention to letters of accusation, report, etc. directly from the masses, thinking that it did not matter whether it was done sooner or later. This shows how much we lacked a mass viewpoint. In addition, our work style was sometimes perfunctory, lacking a serious and responsible attitude. We did not handle letters from the people by distinguishing between importance and urgency and combining them with central tasks, but rather delayed or only arranged without inspection, resulting in many letters from the people not being handled, and even if they were "handled," the problem was not solved. This caused some dissatisfaction among the masses towards us. Upon inspection, the main reason for our errors was that our class consciousness was not high enough and we did not care enough about the suffering of the people. Furthermore, we did not study the instructions from higher authorities enough, such as the "Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Handling Letters from the People and Receiving People," which has been promulgated for more than a year, but I have not studied it well, and therefore do not recognize its political significance, and passively cope with the work of handling letters from the people.

    In addition to immediately handling the backlog of letters from the people, we are determined to strengthen our learning and earnestly correct our mistakes in the future.

    Liu Derong, Deputy Procurator of the Changqing County People's Procuratorate, Shandong Province

    长清县人民检察署
    检查处理人民来信工作
    编辑同志：七月十七日人民日报刊载的“建议长清县人民政府检查对人民来信的处理情况”一文中，提到我署积压来信的错误。这一意见是正确的，我们已经作了检查。
    过去，我们对处理人民来信工作的重要性认识不足，只把它当作一般的工作来对待（当然一切工作都是应该做好的）。我们处理人民来信的态度也是不老实的。如果是上级（或报社）转来的人民来信，我们就比较重视，处理得也比较快，因为怕上级检查、批评甚至处分。但直接来自群众的控告、检举等信件，我们就不重视，认为早一天或迟一天都不大要紧。这可以说明我们多么缺乏群众观点。另外，我们的工作作风有时是潦草从事的，缺乏严肃负责的态度。对人民来信不是分别轻重缓急、结合中心工作进行处理，而是拖延或只布置不检查，致使许多人民来信没有得到处理，有的即使“处理”了也没有解决问题。这样就引起一些群众对我们的不满。检查起来，我们之所以产生这样的错误，主要是我们的阶级觉悟不高，对人民的疾苦不够关怀。再就是我们对上级指示的学习不够，如“中央人民政府政务院关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”，虽然公布一年多了，我就没有很好地学习过，因而不认识它的政治意义，消极地应付人民来信工作。
    我们除立即处理积压的人民来信之外，今后决加强学习，切实改正错误。
    山东省长清县人民检察署副检察长　刘德荣
