    There are Many Problems at Jingxing Coal Mine
    They Should be Resolved Quickly and Seriously

    Editor's Note: Recently, we have received many letters from workers, technicians, and working comrades of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Jingxing Coal Mine. They have raised many opinions on the old technical viewpoints and conservative thinking of the technical personnel of the Jingxing Coal Mine, and on the failure of leading cadres to pay attention to the promotion of advanced production experience and neglect of safety work. We hope that the technical personnel and leading cadres of Jingxing Coal Mine will pay attention to these opinions, transform their bourgeois ideology, change their bureaucratic style, quickly adopt advanced Soviet technology, promote advanced production experience, reform production, and rapidly increase coal production to complete the state's production tasks; and quickly improve safety work, add necessary safety equipment, and protect the lives of workers. Paying attention to advanced technology, advanced experience, and protecting the lives of workers are all important links in industrial production, and should never be ignored. We hope that factories and mines with similar situations will urgently take action to improve.

    井陉煤矿问题很多
    应该迅速认真解决
    编者按：最近我们接到井陉煤矿的工人、技术员和煤矿管理总局的工作同志的不少来信。他们对于井陉煤矿的技术人员的旧技术观点、保守思想，对于领导干部的不重视推广先进生产经验和忽视保安工作等各方面，提出了很多意见。我们希望井陉煤矿的技术人员和领导干部，重视这些意见，改造自己的资产阶级思想，转变自己的官僚主义作风，迅速地采用苏联先进技术，推广先进生产经验，改革生产，使煤产量迅速提高，以完成国家的生产任务；并迅速地改进保安工作，增设必要的安全设备，保障工人的生命安全。重视先进技术、先进经验和保障工人的生命安全，都是工业生产中的重要环节，决不应该忽视。我们希望有类似情况的工厂矿山，都应急起改进。
