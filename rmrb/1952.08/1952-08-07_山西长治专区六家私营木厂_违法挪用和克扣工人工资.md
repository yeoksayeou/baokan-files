To the Editor: The six private wood factories of Gongtai, Zhigong, Qinghua, Guangxing, Shengli, and Sanju in Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province, contracted to build 108 rooms for the Changzhi Normal School. The contract stipulated: 19 jin of rice per day for skilled workers and 11 jin of rice per day for unskilled workers. An average of 2,350 workers were needed, and wages were to be paid in three installments. However, after the contractors received the wages in installments, they did not pay the workers on time, but waited until the entire project was completed to pay them. Their excuse was: "We are afraid that the workers will run away if we pay them." Of course, the real reason was not this. Gongtai Factory embezzled the first batch of wages to buy tools; Guangxing Factory used the workers' wages to pay business tax; and other factories also used the funds arbitrarily. In addition, Gongtai Factory contracted for 720 workers, but actually employed 1,230 workers, exceeding the original plan by 510 workers. The excess number of workers accounted for 70 percent of the original planned number of workers, thus reducing the actual wages earned by the workers. Because there was no cook, the workers had to cook their own meals, which wasted work time. The rent for housing also had to be paid out of the wages. Therefore, the actual wages earned by the workers decreased again and again, and the workers had to rush to work in the moonlight and under electric lights. Qin Yunzhen, a worker, was hit in the head by a brick and had to rest for four or five days due to the injury. Gongtai Factory not only did not provide treatment, but also deducted his wages for the days of rest. The contractors also implemented the so-called "tiger class" practice, deducting 12.5 percent of the workers' wages, further reducing the workers' income. We believe that after the "Five-Anti" movement, it is unacceptable for these six private wood factories to treat workers in this way. The local administrative and trade union departments in charge of the construction industry should quickly deal with this issue.

### 山西长治专区六家私营木厂  违法挪用和克扣工人工资

    山西长治专区六家私营木厂
    违法挪用和克扣工人工资
    编辑同志：山西长治专区公泰、职工、庆华、光兴、胜利、三聚六家私营木厂，给省立长治师范包盖房子一百零八间。合同上规定：大工每日工资十九斤米，小工每日工资十一斤米。平均需工二千三百五十个，工资分三期领发完毕。但承包主分期领到工资后，并不按时发给工人，要待全部工程完竣后才发。他们的说法是：“怕发了工人跑掉”。当然，真实的原因并非如此。公泰厂把第一批领下来的工资擅自挪用买了工具；光兴厂把工人的工资款缴了营业税；其他各厂也任意动用。此外，公泰厂包的是七百二十个工的工程，结果施工一千二百三十个工，超出原计划五百一十个工。超工数占原计划工数百分之七十，因而，降低了工人实得工资。因为没有伙夫，工人自己做饭误的工，住房子的租金，都得在工资内开销，因此，工人实得工资一再下降，工人不得不在月光下、电灯下赶活。工人秦芸申被砖砸破了头，带伤休息四、五日，公泰厂不仅不予治疗，反扣其休息日的工资。承包主又实行所谓“老虎班”的作法，扣去工人百分之十二点五的工资，工人所得工资更少了。我们认为在“五反”运动后，这六家私营木厂还以这种态度对待工人，是不能容许的，当地领导建筑业的行政和工会方面，应迅速处理这个问题。武艾巍
