Xinhua News Agency: State-owned and public factories and mines in North China have extensively mobilized workers to formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy, greatly tapping the potential of production.

The mobilization of all workers to formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy is an unprecedented mass production reform movement for the entire North China region. Through this movement, leading cadres at all levels saw the enormous potential of North China's industry for the first time. The figures for increased production and economy in many provinces and cities increased after discussions with workers. In Zhangjiakou City, eighteen enterprises originally planned to increase production and economize by 80 billion yuan for the whole year. After mobilizing workers for discussion, the figures for increased production and economy in twelve of these units exceeded 50% of the 80 billion yuan. All factories and mines conducted profound criticism of conservative thinking that neglected the promotion of advanced Soviet experiences and the labor creativity of workers. In the machine manufacturing industry, initially, many people believed that most of the factories in North China had belt-driven lathes and could not implement high-speed cutting. However, during the widespread mobilization of workers to discuss the plan, high-speed cutting gradually began to be implemented on 50% of the belt-driven lathes, increasing the efficiency of the machine tools by one to two times, and even more than twenty times when manufacturing individual parts.

In various places, some factories and mines formulated plans first and then held competitions, while others formulated plans after the competition began. Regardless of the order, they all regarded mobilizing the masses as the key to formulating a good plan. The methods of formulating plans are roughly divided into two types: one is represented by Chahar Province, where the leadership generally proposes targets, which are submitted to workshops and groups for extensive discussion, and finally summarized and balanced before being announced for implementation; the other is represented by Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and Shanxi Jinhua Textile Factory, where a few groups are first used as focal points to create typical experiences, and then the entire factory is organized to universally formulate group plans, which are reviewed by the workshops and re-examined by the factory-level administration before being integrated into a factory-wide plan for increasing production and practicing economy. Both methods are combined with the promotion of advanced experiences and finding shortcuts. In the Meng Shuyuan group of the spinning workshop of Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the white flower rate of the whole group dropped from 8.9 pounds to more than 6 pounds, and the winding time dropped from 37 seconds to 32.5 seconds. Many factories and mines have achieved better results by formulating plans based on specific circumstances, grasping key issues, and concentrating the wisdom of the masses. For example, the main problems of Taiyuan Cement Factory are to continue to increase production and reduce costs. In the formulation of the plan, the focus of the finished product workshop is on how to increase production, while the sintering workshop focuses on improving the quality of sintered blocks and reducing costs.

In the formulation of the plan, it is very important to ensure that the plans of each department of each factory and mine can be balanced with each other. The method of Beijing Liulihe Cement Factory is to strengthen the weak links, catch up with the advanced departments, and make progress together. This factory had a lot of semi-finished products in the sintering workshop, but the finished product workshop could not grind them out. During this plan formulation, they carried out a labor and machine adjustment, preparing to transfer one grinding machine from the coal grinding workshop to supplement the finished product workshop. While formulating the production plan, Shijingshan Power Plant also paid special attention to safety and hygiene work, inspected places where hidden accidents might occur, and improved the ventilation equipment in the workshop. Applying asbestos ash to the furnace wall not only prevents heat from being emitted from the furnace but also lowers the indoor temperature and protects the health of the workers.

After the plan was formulated, Tianjin adopted a method of summarizing the plan to review it once, and most factories and mines in Beijing, Tangshan, and other places are conducting key reviews to make the plan more realistic. The following problems have been found in the places that have been inspected: (1) The production department's plan has been formulated, but the management department's cooperation is not enough. After the competition started in Shijiazhuang Railway Factory, work was often stopped waiting for materials. (2) Some factories and mines only require workers to complete production tasks but neglect important guarantee conditions such as safety and hygiene. Therefore, after the competition started in Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Factory, three accidents occurred in one day, injuring six workers. (3) After the competition started, production increased, but some factories and mines neglected quality. After the competition started in Tangshan Huaxin Yarn Factory, the white flower rate increased from 0.43% to 0.68%, and the substandard cloth rate increased from 0.69% to 1.19% in four days. These problems have begun to be corrected in various places to further promote the healthy progress of the movement.

### 华北各厂矿发动职工制订增产节约计划

    华北各厂矿发动职工制订增产节约计划
    【新华社讯】华北国营、公营厂矿广泛发动职工制订增产节约计划，大大发掘了生产的潜在能力。
    发动全体职工制订增产节约计划，就华北全区来说，是一个空前的群众性的生产大改革运动。经过这次运动，使各级领导干部第一次看到了华北工业的巨大潜在力。很多省、市的增产节约数字，经职工讨论后都增加了。张家口市十八个企业单位，原计划全年增产节约八百亿元，发动职工讨论后，其中十二个单位的增产节约数字便超过了八百亿元的百分之五十。各厂矿对忽视推广苏联先进经验与职工劳动创造的保守思想都进行了深刻的批判。在机器制造工业中，开始有不少人认为华北工厂大部是皮带车床，不能实行高速切削；但在普遍发动职工讨论计划中，高速切削便逐渐在百分之五十的皮带车床上推行起来，使机床的工作效率提高了一倍到二倍，制造个别零件时甚至提高二十倍以上。
    各地厂矿，有的先订计划而后竞赛，有的在竞赛开始后才订计划；不论先后，都把发动群众作为订好计划的关键。订计划的方法大致分为两种：一种以察哈尔省为代表，各厂矿一般先由领导上提出指标，交车间、小组广泛讨论，最后汇总平衡，公布执行；另一种以天津棉纺一厂与山西晋华纺织厂为代表，先以几个小组为重点创造典型经验，然后组织全厂普遍制订小组计划，经车间审查、厂级行政复审后，综合为全厂增产节约计划。两种作法都与推广先进经验、找窍门相结合。天津棉纺一厂细纱车间孟淑媛小组，在订计划中认真地钻研郝建秀工作法，计划订出的第二天，全组的白花率就由八点九磅降至六磅多，络纱时间从三十七秒降为三十二点五秒。很多厂矿由于根据具体情况，抓住关键问题，集中群众智慧来制订计划，结果就更好。如太原水泥厂主要是继续提高产量与降低成本问题，在制订计划中，成品车间的重点便是如何想办法增加产量；烧成车间便着重提高烧块质量和降低成本。
    制订计划中，如何使每个厂矿各部门的计划能够互相平衡，是十分重要的。北京琉璃河水泥厂的办法是加强薄弱环节，赶上先进部门，齐头并进。这个厂烧成车间半成品多，成品车间磨不出来。这次订计划时，他们就进行一次劳动力与机器的调整，准备由磨煤车间调出一盘磨机，补充成品车间。石景山发电厂，在制订生产计划的同时，还特别注意安全卫生工作，检查了可能发生隐形事故的地方，改善了车间的通风设备；在炉壁上敷石绵灰，既防止炉温散发，又降低室内温度，保护工人健康。
    制订计划之后，天津采取了总结订计划的方式把计划复查一次，北京、唐山等地大部分厂矿正进行重点复查，以使计划更加切合实际。经过检查的地方，已发现下列几个问题：（一）生产部门的计划订出来了，而管理部门配合不够。石家庄铁路工厂竞赛开始后，经常停工待料。（二）有些厂矿只要求工人完成生产任务，却忽视安全、卫生等重要保证条件。因此，张家口矿山机械厂竞赛开始后，一天中即发生了三次事故，伤工人六名。（三）竞赛开始后产量都有提高，某些厂矿却忽视质量。唐山华新纱厂竞赛开始后，四天中，白花率由百分之零点四三增至零点六八，次布率由百分之零点六九增至一点一九。这些问题各地已开始注意纠正，以进一步使运动健康地前进。
