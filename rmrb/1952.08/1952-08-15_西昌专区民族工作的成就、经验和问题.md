The Xichang area is located in the southern part of Xikang Province and is a region where various ethnic groups live together. The total population of the area is nearly three million, including 1.17 million Han people, 1.5 million Yi people, and others including Tibetan, Mosuo, Lisu, Bai Yi, Miao, and Hui people. The Han and Hui people mostly reside in the Anning River valley and other river valley plains. The Yi people mostly live in the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains. The remaining groups, except for the Tibetan and Mosuo who have their own relatively concentrated areas, the Lisu, Bai Yi, Miao, and a portion of the Tibetan people, are mostly distributed in the areas where the Han and Yi people intersect.

Before liberation, successive reactionary rulers and the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique adopted policies of ethnic oppression, and various ethnic minorities continuously resisted. The reactionary rulers consistently treated the Yi people with "military suppression," "appeasement and suppression," "using Yi to control Yi," and "playing with Yi and eating Yi." The so-called "using Yi to control Yi" and "playing with Yi and eating Yi" meant using every possible means to provoke disunity among the various ethnic groups, especially within the Yi people; it meant relying on suppressing all ethnic groups, especially the Yi people, to gain promotions and wealth. Almost every local tyrant made a living by creating ethnic friction. Therefore, before liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in this area were constantly fighting each other. In the long-term infighting, many densely populated areas in the Yi-Han border region became barren. Internal feuds among the Yi people also developed, with almost every branch feuding, and even brothers feuding. Fortified bunkers were everywhere, and there was no communication. Not only could Han merchants and other personnel not enter without protection, but even the Yi people themselves could not travel more than ten miles. Every family used their savings to buy weapons for fighting each other.

Due to the above reasons, the political, economic, and cultural development of all ethnic groups stagnated for a long time. The Yi people of Liangshan could not smelt iron themselves, and their agricultural tools were very backward. They relied entirely on superstition for medical treatment. They had their own independent language but no complete writing system.

The above is the basic situation of ethnic issues in the Xichang area before liberation.

Achievements of the past two years

At the end of March 1950, the People's Liberation Army liberated Xichang. In the past two years, the ethnic situation in the Xichang area has undergone fundamental changes.

After the liberation of the Xichang area, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries and local feudal forces, unwilling to accept defeat, attempted to incite the people of various ethnic minorities to create riots in August 1950. However, because we timely exposed the conspiracies of bandits and secret agents, the people of all ethnic groups not only did not fall for it, but also actively responded to the call of the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army and launched a movement to capture bandits. In the movement to capture bandits, many heroic model figures emerged from all ethnic groups. For example, Yi cadres Cai Jinfa and Cai Changfa, regardless of the weather, day or night, went deep into the mountains in an area spanning more than 300 miles to repeatedly search for bandits. Cai Changfa also voluntarily took out three dan of grain, two cows, and five sheep as expenses and searched the mountains for 31 days, killing three bandit leaders, wounding two, capturing six, and seizing four rifles and 127 rounds of ammunition.

With the active support of the people of all ethnic groups and the efforts of the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits, the bandits were quickly eliminated. Now, except for a few areas where there are still a few bandits, there are no more bandit gangs in the entire area, and social order is unprecedentedly stable.

In order to completely eliminate the common enemies of the people of all ethnic groups—the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries—and to eliminate their social base—the feudal landlord class—the people of all ethnic groups, under the call of the People's Government, united and carried out rent reduction, deposit refunds, anti-tyrant and land reform work in the Han areas during the suppression of bandits. Bandits, secret agents, and members of the landlord class who insisted on a reactionary stance tried every means to distort our policies and attempt to incite ethnic minorities to oppose us. Because we correctly implemented policies under the leadership of our superiors, we shattered the conspiracies of bandits, secret agents, and the landlord class, and further isolated them. Landlords and tyrants who fled to ethnic minority areas and their property scattered in ethnic minority areas were mostly turned over by the people of ethnic minorities. When distributing the fruits of land reform, Han farmers appropriately took care of the local ethnic minorities. Because the people of all ethnic minorities had been oppressed by local landlords and tyrants in the past, they participated in the grievance and struggle meetings together with the Han farmers, which further strengthened the unity between the ethnic groups in the struggle. Now land reform has been completed in the Han areas of the entire area.

In the past two years, we have reasonably mediated disputes between and within ethnic groups. Some of these disputes had been going on for decades, and some involved many branches. Without appropriate and correct handling methods, it would be difficult to achieve unity.

For these disputes, we decided to conduct reasonable mediation under the principle of strengthening unity, and through mediation, find out the causes of the disputes and raise the awareness of the people of all ethnic groups. Cadres in various places have actively carried out this work, making it a mass movement. Many areas have established mediation committees and formulated unity covenants. In the past two years, a total of 5,810 disputes have been mediated throughout the area. From January to the end of 1951, the Yi Autonomous Region of Zhaojue County alone mediated 1,153 disputes. Now disputes between and within ethnic groups have been greatly reduced, and feuding has become an isolated phenomenon. In the past, the Yi people had to sleep with guns at night, herd cattle and sheep with guns, farm with sentries, and go out with guns and guarantors. Enemies could not eat together. Now these phenomena no longer exist. From Xichang to Zhaojue, from Zhaojue to Dengchang, people of all ethnic groups, whether Han, Yi, or other, can walk alone. Merchants no longer need guarantors to do business, and enemies can now eat, work, and meet together. The people of all ethnic groups are extremely happy about this situation.

In the process of mediating disputes, the people of all ethnic groups further recognized the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries and tyrants in provoking their disunity, universally expressed their grievances, and investigated the root causes of the feuds. After the successful resolution of the sixteen-year feud between the Nuomi Jia in Hongmao Magu District of Xichang, Nuomi Watie (person's name) wept while drinking and said: "Thank Chairman Mao and the working comrades! Now the youth of both branches must recognize that our feud is not the fault of either branch. This was created by Deng Xiuting (the former pseudo-Jingbian Commander, a great tyrant). Although I was the first to act at that time, I was forced to do so by Deng Xiuting. I am extremely sorry. I hope you young people will unite and love each other to the end under the leadership of the People's Government."

In the past two years, the Xichang area has universally implemented the policy of ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic united government. Now the entire area has established one county-level autonomous region, ten district-level autonomous regions, and 81 township-level autonomous regions (including newly established townships). In addition to the establishment of an ethnic democratic united government at the area level, five counties and seven districts have established such governments. Other county and district governments also have ethnic minority cadres participating in the work. The total number of ethnic minority cadres participating in government work throughout the area is: two at the area level, fifteen at the county level, seventy at the district level, and 474 general cadres, totaling 561 (excluding members of government committees at all levels and members of the area consultation committee who do not participate in actual work). A total of 86 ethnic minority cadres participate in financial and economic departments. In areas where regional autonomy has been implemented or ethnic democratic united governments have been established, all ethnic minorities have a sense of ownership and can automatically rise up to capture bandits, strengthen unity, and engage in production, thus creating a new atmosphere.

In addition, all counties in the area have held an average of three to four ethnic people's representative conferences in the past two years. At each conference, the representatives present actively spoke, and after the meeting, they conscientiously implemented the resolutions.

Based on the actual situation in the Xichang area, the future task is to continue to promote the policy of ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic united government. To this end, we must widely carry out the democratic construction movement. Preparations are now underway.

In the past two years, production work has made preliminary progress, and the economies of the brotherly ethnic minority areas have gradually become active.

Our production policy for ethnic minority areas is mainly to promote agricultural production, gradually improve agricultural tools and improve production technology, and strengthen trade work. In terms of agricultural production, the government plans to loan 60,000 agricultural tools to various ethnic minority areas this year (a portion has been loaned), and other grain and loans are appropriately distributed according to needs, just like in the Han areas. With the active help of the government, the production enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups has been greatly improved. The Yi people of Zhaojue have reclaimed the land that was barren due to feuds in the past. There is a Liegewu Weir in Fucheng District of Zhaojue, which the Baqie family wanted to build several years ago, but this wish has only been realized this year with the help of the People's Government. The entire weir is 15 miles long and can irrigate more than 1,500 mu of land. The Yi people did not pay attention to accumulating fertilizer in the past, but now they have begun to pay attention. Production groups have also been widely organized in various places.

Because traffic obstacles have been reduced, many areas have established trade company branches, sales stations, and purchasing stations. The Tibetan and Yi people have organized pack horses to engage in transportation work. Zhaojue County alone has 1,238 horses regularly transporting goods between Zhaojue and Xichang. Last year, the trade company purchased a total of 139,900 jin of cowhide, 78,000 jin of sheepskin, 8,700 jin of hog bristles, and other products such as lard, pepper, yellow silk, medicinal materials, and grain, totaling more than 1 billion yuan in value. It supplied the people of all ethnic minorities with 163,200 jin of salt, 26,300 pieces of homespun cloth, and 1,810 bolts of foreign cloth, plus grain, agricultural tools, and general merchandise, totaling approximately 2 billion yuan in value. The price comparison between local specialties and industrial products has also changed significantly. For example, in 1949 (before liberation), one dan of cowhide could only be exchanged for 75 jin of salt, but in 1951 it could be exchanged for 190 jin. Last year, the prices of three kinds of livestock products increased by 101% compared with 1950. The prices of three kinds of medicinal materials increased by 51% compared with 1950. The purchasing power of the Yi people in Liangshan has greatly increased compared to the past. The Yi people near Zhaojue, who used to eat only one or two jin of salt each year, now eat four or five jin, and those who could not afford cloth in the past can now afford it. The Yi people in Yuexi and Dechang mostly buy good cloth transported from other places and buy less homespun cloth. Some people have begun to use soap, towels, and flashlights. The Yi people in Puwei even requested to buy sewing machines to make clothes. Because of the development of trade work, many market places have been restored in various places, and many new market places have been established. In the past, there were no other houses in Zhaojue city except for a few tiled houses of the old county government. Now the city is full of houses and has expanded outside the city. In addition to state-owned enterprises, there are 29 grocery stalls. There is a market every day, and five pigs can be sold in a day. The Yi people carry dry food and travel for two or three days to visit Zhaojue.

Cultural education and health work have also made preliminary progress in the past two years. In the past, due to the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people of all ethnic groups had no opportunity to develop their own cultural education. Sending Yi children to school was actually sending hostages to the reactionary government. There was no right to study their own ethnic language in school. After liberation, the people of all ethnic groups urgently demanded to run schools so that their children would have the opportunity to study. In the past two years, we have established 11 ethnic primary schools, enrolling more than 700 students, and plan to add 19 more this year. The area's ethnic cadre school has been run for three terms, graduating a total of 1,179 students. Most of the graduates have been sent to the Southwest Nationalities Institute and the Central Nationalities Institute for further study, and a small number have remained at the school for further study, while the majority have participated in practical work.

Except for the Tibetan and Miao ethnic groups, which have independent writing systems, most of the other ethnic minorities in the Xichang area do not have independent writing systems. This greatly limits the development of their own culture. During the visit of the Central Ethnic Visiting Group, Mr. Chen Shilin of the visiting group helped create a new Latinized Yi script, which was very popular among Yi youth. More than 2,000 people have learned to use this script, and it is continuing to be tested and promoted. Young people of all ethnic groups are also eager to learn Chinese, as it is a very convenient tool for them to learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The People's Government is trying to meet their needs.

Due to limited conditions, health work has been very inadequate. In the past two years, in addition to the Central Ethnic Visiting Group treating many patients during their visit to the people of all ethnic groups, we have only established a health center in Zhaojue, and the provincial People's Government has sent an epidemic prevention team. After the establishment of the Yi Autonomous Region People's Government in Zhaojue County, it treated 15,391 Yi people. Most areas still rely on superstitious methods to treat diseases, which requires the assistance of the higher-level government to change this situation.

Our Experiences

In the past two years, we have had the following experiences in our work:

(1) It is necessary to conduct in-depth education on ethnic policies for cadres at all levels and strengthen their ideological leadership in their work.

The influence of the past ethnic oppression system and the long-standing estrangement between ethnic groups cannot be quickly eliminated. Although general cadres know that the ethnic policy is correct, they often waver when dealing with specific issues. This is the main obstacle we encounter in implementing ethnic policies.

When the Xichang area was first liberated, there were arguments such as: "The Yi people fear power but do not cherish virtue," "It is better to belong to the Yi people, who are not an oppressed ethnic group but an ethnic group that oppresses others," "Your ethnic policy can be used for other ethnic groups, but not for the Yi people..." We timely and sharply refuted the above-mentioned reactionary theories and specifically analyzed the causes of ethnic relations and ethnic estrangement in the Xichang area, exposing the crimes of the reactionary rulers in implementing ethnic oppression. This initially clarified the confused thinking among the troops and cadres. However, this problem cannot be completely solved at once, so we must continue to pay attention to solving this problem in various tasks. We must always pay attention to strengthening ideological leadership and preventing any incorrect thinking from occurring.

(2) It is necessary to unswervingly unite the people of all ethnic groups, isolate and eliminate bandits, secret agents, and tyrants. Bandits, secret agents, and tyrants are the common enemies of the people of all ethnic groups. Due to historical relations, the people of all ethnic groups cannot easily recognize their true faces at once. In addition, there are complex disputes between the people of all ethnic groups, which requires us to have a clear policy: we must resolutely expose and crack down on the enemy; we must conduct fair and reasonable mediation of internal disputes; and we must patiently win over and unite those who have been deceived and coerced by the enemy and cannot yet lean towards the government. We must never confuse our internal problems with the problems between the people of all ethnic groups and the enemy.

(3) It is necessary to earnestly promote the policy of ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic united government. This is the key to our implementation of ethnic policies and the basic demand of the people of all ethnic minorities. At the beginning, most ethnic minorities did not believe that the People's Government could really do this. The situation will immediately change in areas where this has been truly done; otherwise, it will be difficult for the ethnic minorities there to completely dispel their doubts about the People's Government. For example, in Qiluogou, Ningnan County, because regional autonomy was not implemented in the past, bandits and secret agents ran rampant, and a large number of landlords and tyrants from other places fled there, making it difficult to carry out work. However, because the troops helped the area establish an autonomous region people's government during the suppression of bandits, the Yi people assisted the troops in annihilating all the local bandits, and the work here began to be carried out. Therefore, we must earnestly promote the policy of ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic united government, and not just stop at lip service.

The biggest obstacle to implementing ethnic regional autonomy and establishing an ethnic democratic united government is that some cadres use the excuse of "insufficient preparation and immature conditions" to cause delays. Some areas that have not yet implemented ethnic regional autonomy are indeed due to insufficient strength, but most are because they do not understand this policy enough, rather than because of insufficient preparation.

(4) It is necessary to earnestly unite and cultivate ethnic cadres. Without ethnic cadres, it is impossible to implement ethnic regional autonomy and establish an ethnic democratic united government. To solve the problem of cultivating ethnic cadres, we must pay attention to uniting patriotic intellectuals, mass activists in various works, and upper-level figures and leaders who have connections with the people in all ethnic groups. In addition, we must actively cultivate a large number of young cadres. In this way, there will be no problem with the source of cadres. In the past two years, in addition to uniting the few local patriotic intellectuals, most of the mass activists in various works and the leading figures who have connections with the local people have also been absorbed to participate in the work. Some comrades do not have enough understanding of uniting the leading figures who have connections with the local people, which is not right.

Cadres in some areas have had the idea of relying on higher levels to send a large number of ready-made cadres, which is not possible in reality. Now there are a certain number of ethnic cadres in general ethnic areas, and ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic united governments should be implemented at an appropriate time to better cultivate ethnic cadres. The idea of waiting until a large number of cadres have been trained before establishing a government is not realistic.

(5) Finally, we must also pay attention to the historical characteristics of the various ethnic minority areas, adopt working methods suitable for the specific conditions of each ethnic area, and carry out work.

Several issues that should be addressed in the future

At present, there are still many problems in the ethnic work in the Xichang area, which are:

(1) In areas where ethnic regional autonomy has been implemented and ethnic democratic united governments have been established, the main issue in the future is to truly establish and enrich the work content of the autonomous organs of the autonomous region and the ethnic democratic united government; to effectively help ethnic minority cadres in the autonomous organs to carry out work, so that the ethnic minority cadres in the ethnic democratic united government have the power and responsibility; and to effectively give play to the role of the autonomous organs and the ethnic democratic united government to serve the people of all ethnic groups. At present, the autonomous organs in areas where regional autonomy has been implemented cannot fully play their due role based on ethnic characteristics. The ethnic democratic united government's arrangement and guidance of work are still very generalized, and some departments do not pay enough attention to the problems that urgently need to be solved in ethnic minority areas. Han cadres in the autonomous organs and the ethnic democratic united government still have a tendency to take over and do everything themselves. If these problems cannot be properly resolved, the policy of ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic united government cannot be said to be fully implemented, and we must pay attention to them.

(2) At present, the phenomenon of ethnic disunity still exists in some areas. In addition to continuing to completely eliminate bandits and secret agents and continuing to mediate disputes between and within ethnic groups, the main way to solve this problem is to overcome Great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism. These two tendencies not only actually exist among the people of all ethnic groups, but also exist among cadres. If the two tendencies among cadres cannot be overcome, it will be impossible to educate the people to overcome these two tendencies. Among these two tendencies, Great Han chauvinism is still the main one at present. Therefore, in the future, the main task should be to require Han cadres to overcome the tendency of Great Han chauvinism, and at the same time, to require fraternal ethnic cadres to be vigilant, prevent, and overcome the tendency of narrow nationalism. To this end, the essence of Great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism must be constantly exposed and criticized. Some Han cadres believe that it is not a serious mistake to have a tendency of Great Han chauvinism, and they do not earnestly try to overcome it, and even take a disregard attitude towards the instructions of higher authorities. This erroneous thinking and erroneous behavior must be corrected.

(3) Developing the production of the brotherly ethnic minority areas has become the main task in the future. Only by grasping this work can we gradually improve the material and cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups, so that the people of all ethnic groups can further recognize the greatness of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy and the loveliness of the motherland. However, some cadres have not paid enough attention to this issue, especially the cadres in ethnic mixed areas, who concentrate most of their efforts on production work in the Han areas and do not pay attention to production in the ethnic minority areas, which urgently needs to be corrected.

(4) Social reforms in various ethnic minority areas will inevitably be gradually put forward. On this issue, we must adopt cautious policies that are in line with the actual situation, based on the wishes of the people of all ethnic groups and the leading figures who have connections with the people, and proceed step by step and in a planned manner through the people of all ethnic groups themselves. We should not demand too much too quickly, and Han cadres should not take over and do everything themselves. In the past, many comrades adopted a rash attitude on this issue and did not properly handle some issues related to the various ethnic groups. Bandits, secret agents, and tyrants took the opportunity to spread rumors and incite trouble, adding a lot of concerns to the people of all ethnic groups. These shortcomings should not be repeated in the future.

    西昌专区民族工作的成就、经验和问题
    西康省西昌专区联合政府专员  梁文英
    西昌专区在西康省南部，是民族杂居的地区。全区人口约近三百万，其中汉族一百一十七万人，彝族一百五十余万人，其他为藏族、摩些、傈僳、摆彝及苗、回等族。汉、回两族大部分布在安宁河流域及其他河沟平坝地带。彝族大部聚居在大、小凉山地区。其余除藏族、摩些族各有一定的聚居区以外，傈僳、摆彝、苗族及藏族中的一部，多分布在汉、彝交界地区。
    解放以前，历代反动统治者及国民党反动统治集团都采取了民族压迫政策，各少数民族也进行了不断的反抗。反动统治者一贯对待彝族人民的办法是“武力镇压”、“剿抚兼施”、“以彝制彝”、“玩彝吃彝”。所谓“以彝制彝”、“玩彝吃彝”，就是用尽一切办法挑拨各族人民的团结，挑拨各民族内部特别是彝族内部的团结；就是依靠镇压各族人民，特别是依靠镇压彝族人民来升官发财。这里的恶霸几乎没有一个不是靠制造民族摩擦吃饭的。因此，解放前这个地区的各族人民无日不在互斗。在长期互斗中，彝、汉交界地区，多少人烟稠密的地方，变成一片荒芜。彝族人民内部冤家纠纷，也日益发展，几乎无支不冤家，同支之间甚至兄弟之间也打冤家。各处碉堡林立，互不往来。不仅汉族商人及其他人员无保不能进去，连彝族自己也相互走不出十里以外。各家稍有积蓄，都用来购买武器，以便互斗。
    由于以上的原因，各民族的政治、经济、文化都长期停滞不前。凉山彝族人民自己不能冶铁，农具十分落后。治病全靠迷信。他们有独立的语言，但无完备的文字。
    以上是解放以前西昌专区民族问题的基本情况。
    两年来的工作成就
    一九五零年三月底，人民解放军解放了西昌。两年来，西昌专区的民族情况已经发生了基本变化。
    西昌专区解放后，国民党反动派残余及当地封建势力因不甘心失败，在一九五零年八月间曾企图煽动各少数民族人民制造暴乱；但由于我们及时地揭露了土匪、特务的阴谋，各族人民不仅没有上当，而且积极响应了人民政府、人民解放军的号召，掀起了捕匪运动。各族人民在捕捉土匪运动中，涌现了不少英雄模范人物。如彝族干部蔡金发、蔡长发在纵横三百余里的地区内，不分天晴落雨、白天黑夜，深入大山，反复搜索土匪。蔡长发还自动拿出三担粮食、两条牛、五只羊作用费，搜山三十一天，击毙匪首三名、伤二名，俘匪六名，缴获长短枪四支，子弹一百二十七发。
    在各族人民积极支援及人民解放军努力清剿下，土匪很快被消灭了。现在，除个别地区还有少数土匪外，全区已无股匪，社会秩序空前安定。
    为了彻底消灭各族人民的共同敌人——国民党反动派的残余，并消灭其社会基础——封建地主阶级，在围剿土匪期间，各族人民在人民政府号召下，团结一致进行了汉族地区减租、退押、反恶霸及土地改革工作。土匪、特务和地主阶级中坚持反动立场的分子曾经想尽一切办法，歪曲我们的政策，企图煽动少数民族反对我们。因为我们在上级的领导下，正确执行了政策，便粉碎了土匪、特务及地主阶级的阴谋，并进一步孤立了他们。逃亡在少数民族地区的地主恶霸及他们分散在少数民族地区的财产，多被少数民族人民送了出来。分配果实的时候，汉族农民都适当地照顾了当地少数民族。各少数民族人民因为过去受当地地主恶霸的压榨，都和汉族农民一块参加了诉苦斗争大会，在斗争中更加强了民族间的团结。现在全区汉族地区已经完成了土地改革。
    两年多来，我们合理地调解了各民族间及民族内部的纠纷。这些纠纷有的已有几十年的历史，有的牵连到好多支系，如果没有适当正确的处理办法，就很难达到团结的目的。
    对这些纠纷，我们确定在加强团结的原则下，进行合理的调解，并通过调解，找出发生纠纷的原因，提高各族人民的觉悟。各地干部都积极进行了这项工作，使这项工作成为群众性的运动。不少地区都成立了调解委员会，订立了团结公约。两年多以来全区共调解纠纷五千八百一十件。昭觉县彝族自治区从一九五一年一月到年底就调解了纠纷一千
    一百五十三件。现在民族间及民族内部的纠纷已大为减少，打冤家已成为个别现象。过去彝族在夜里要抱枪睡觉，放牛羊要带枪，种田要放哨，出门要带枪、找保，冤家对头不能在一块吃饭。现在这些现象已不存在。西昌到昭觉，昭觉到灯厂，不论汉、彝或其他各族人民单个人都可以走路了。商人来作买卖也不再找保，冤家已经可以在一块吃饭、工作和开会。各族人民面对这种情况，都欢快无比。
    在调解纠纷的过程中，各族人民更认识了过去国民党反动派及恶霸挑拨他们的团结的罪恶，普遍进行了诉苦，并追究了打冤家的根子。西昌红毛麻姑区糯米家十六年的冤家纠纷圆满解决后，糯米瓦铁
    （人名）一边喝酒一边流泪说：“感谢毛主席和工作同志们！现在两支的青年要认清：我们的冤家不怪那一支，这是邓秀廷（过去的伪靖边司令，大恶霸）给我们造成的。那时虽是我先动手，但我是被邓秀廷强迫着干的，我是抱歉万分。希望你们青年人在人民政府领导下，团结和爱到底。”
    两年多来，西昌专区普遍推行了民族的区域自治和民族民主联合政府的政策。现在全区已建立了县级自治区一个，区级自治区十个，乡级自治区（包括新建乡）共八十一个。民族民主联合政府除专区级已经建立以外，已有五个县七个区成立了这样的政府，其他县、区政府也都有少数民族干部参加工作。全区参加政权工作的少数民族干部，计：专区级二人，县级十五人，区级七十人，一般干部四百七十四人，共五百六十一人（各级政府委员及专区协商委员会委员中未参加实际工作的不在内）。参加财经部门工作的少数民族干部，共计八十六人。凡是已经实行区域自治或建立了民族民主联合政府的地区，各少数民族都已有了主人翁的感觉，都能自动起来捕捉土匪，加强团结，进行生产，因而气象为之一新。
    此外，全区各县两年多来平均都召开过三至四次各族人民代表会议。在每次会议上，到会代表都能积极发言，会后并能认真执行决议。
    根据西昌专区的实际情况，今后的任务是继续推行民族区域自治及民族民主联合政府政策。为此必须广泛开展民主建政运动。现在正进行准备工作。
    两年多来，生产工作有了初步开展，各兄弟民族地区的经济已经渐渐活跃起来。
    我们对少数民族地区的生产方针主要是提倡农业生产，有步骤地改良农具和提高生产技术，并加强贸易工作。在农业生产方面，政府今年计划贷给各少数民族地区农具六万件（已贷出一部），其他贷粮、贷款都和汉区一样按照需要适当分配。各族人民在政府积极帮助下，生产情绪大大提高。昭觉彝族人民已把过去因打冤家荒芜的土地开垦出来。昭觉附城区有一条列格乌堰，八且家在若干年以前就想兴修，今年才在人民政府帮助下实现了这一愿望。全堰共长十五华里，可增灌一千五百多亩土地。彝族人民过去不注意积肥，现在已开始注意。生产小组也已在各地普遍组织起来。
    因为交通阻碍减少，很多地区已设立了贸易公司支公司、推销站和收购站。藏、彝族人民都组织了驮马，从事运输工作。昭觉县即有一千二百三十八匹马经常在昭觉、西昌间驮运货物。去年一年贸易公司共收购牛皮十三万九千九百余斤，羊皮七万八千余斤，猪鬃八千七百斤，其他还有猪油、花椒、黄丝、药材、粮食等，总计金额值十亿多元。供给各少数民族人民盐巴十六万三千二百余斤，土布二万六千三百件，洋布一千八百一十匹，连粮食、农具、百货等，总计金额约值二十余亿元。土特产品和工业品价格对比也有了显著变化。如一九四九年
    （解放前）牛皮一担只换盐巴七十五斤，一九五一年可换到一百九十斤。去年，有三种畜产品的价格比一九五零年提高百分之一百零一。药材类有三种比一九五零年提高百分之五十一。凉山彝族人民购买力已较前大为提高。昭觉附近彝族人民过去每年只吃一、二斤盐巴的，今年已吃到四、五斤，穿不上布的今年已穿上。越隽、德昌等地彝族人民多买外地运来的好布，买土布的少，有些人并已开始使用香皂、毛巾、手电筒。普威彝族并要求买缝纫机缝制衣服。因为贸易工作的开展，各地恢复了不少集场，并建立了不少新的集场。昭觉城内过去除旧县政府等的几间瓦房以外，再无其他人家。现在城内已盖满房屋，并已发展到城外。除国营企业外，已有二十九家杂货摊贩。天天有集场，一天可卖出五口猪。彝族人民有背上干粮走两三天来昭觉参观的。
    文化教育及卫生工作两年多来也有了初步发展。过去由于国民党反动派的压迫，各族人民根本没有发展自己的文化教育的机会。彝族送子弟入学实际上是给反动政府送人质。在学校没有学习本民族文字的权利。解放后，各族人民都迫切要求办学校，使子弟有读书机会。两年多来我们共成立民族小学校十一所，共招收学生七百余人，今年计划再增设十九所。专区民族干部学校已经办了三期，毕业学生共一千一百七十九人。毕业学生除一部送西南民族学院及中央民族学院继续深造及少部留校继续学习外，大部均参加了实际工作。
    西昌专区各少数民族除藏、苗等族有独立的文字外，其余大都没有独立的文字。这对发展本民族的文化有很大限制。中央民族访问团来这里访问期间，访问团的陈士林先生帮助创造的彝族拉丁化新文字，颇受彝族青年的欢迎。这种文字现已有二千余人学会使用，并正在继续实验和推广。各族青年也迫切要求学习汉文，因为这是他们学习马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的十分方便的工具。人民政府正在设法满足他们的这种要求。
    卫生工作，因为条件的限制，作得十分不够。两年多来除中央民族访问团在访问各族人民期间曾医治了不少病人以外，我们只在昭觉建立了卫生院，并由省人民政府派去一个防疫队。昭觉县彝族自治区人民政府成立后，共医治了彝族人民一万五千三百九十一人。大部地区现在还靠迷信办法治病，这需要上级政府加以帮助，以改变这种情况。
    我们的体验
    两年多来我们在工作当中，有以下体验：
    （一）必须对各级干部深入地进行民族政策教育，并在工作中加强对他们的思想领导。
    过去民族压迫制度的影响和各民族间长期存在的隔阂，是不容易很快消除的。而一般干部虽然知道民族政策是正确的，但在处理具体问题时又往往容易动摇。这就是我们在执行民族政策中所遇到的主要障碍。
    西昌专区初解放时，曾有这样一些论调，如说：“彝族畏威不怀德”，“宁属彝族不是受压迫的民族，而是压迫别人的民族”，“你们的民族政策用之于别的民族可以，用之于彝族不行……。”我们及时地对上述反动理论进行了尖锐的批驳，并且具体地分析了西昌专区的民族关系和民族隔阂形成的原因，揭露了反动统治者实行民族压迫的罪恶，这才初步澄清了部队和干部中的混乱思想。但这一问题并不是一下就能完全解决的，所以还必须在进行各种工作中继续注意解决这一问题。时时注意加强思想领导，防止任何不正确的思想发生。
    （二）必须坚定不移地团结各族人民，孤立和消灭土匪、特务及恶霸。土匪、特务及恶霸是各族人民的共同敌人。由于历史的关系，各族人民不容易一下子认清他们的真面目，再加上各族人民之间又有错综复杂的纠纷，这就要求我们一定要有明确的方针：对敌人一定要坚决进行揭露和打击；对自己内部的纠纷一定要进行公平合理的调处；对于被敌人欺骗胁迫一时还不能向政府靠拢的，一定要耐心地争取、团结。决不能把自己内部的问题和各族人民与敌人之间的问题混淆起来。
    （三）必须认真地推行民族区域自治及民族民主联合政府政策。这是我们执行民族政策的关键，是各少数民族人民的基本要求。各少数民族在开始时多不相信人民政府真能这样作。凡是真正这样作了的地区，情况就会立即改观；否则那里的少数民族即不易完全解除对人民政府的怀疑。如宁南县骑洛沟过去因为没有实行区域自治，土匪、特务到处横行，外地的地主恶霸大批逃亡到那里，工作很难开展。但由于部队在剿匪中帮助该地建立了自治区人民政府，彝族人民便协助部队把当地的股匪全部歼灭了，这里的工作也就开展起来了。所以我们必须认真地推行民族区域自治和民族民主联合政府的政策，而不能只停留在口头上。
    实行民族区域自治及成立民族民主联合政府的最大障碍是有些干部藉口“准备工作不足，条件不成熟”，造成拖延现象。直到现在还没有实行民族区域自治的地区，有些确是因为力量不足，但大部却是因为对这一政策认识不够，而不是因为准备工作不足。
    （四）必须认真地团结和培养民族干部。没有民族干部就无法实行民族的区域自治和成立民族民主联合政府。要解决培养民族干部的问题，必须注意团结各族人民中的爱国知识分子和各种工作中的群众积极分子以及和人民有联系的上层人士和领袖人物，此外并须积极地培养大批青年干部。这样，干部的来源才不致发生问题。我们在两年多以来除团结了当地仅有的一些爱国知识分子以外，各种工作中的群众积极分子以及和当地人民有联系的领袖人物也大部被吸收参加了工作。对团结和当地人民有联系的领袖人物，有些同志认识不够，这是不对的。
    有的地区的干部，曾有依赖上级给派去大批现成干部的想法，这在事实上没有可能。现在一般民族地区都有了一定数量的民族干部，就应该在适当时机，实行民族区域自治，建立民族民主联合政府，借以更好地培养民族干部。那种等待把大批干部培养起来以后才去建立政权的想法，是不切合实际的。
    （五）最后，还必须注意各少数民族地区的历史特点，采取适合于各该民族地区具体情况的工作方法，进行工作。
    今后应注意解决的几个问题
    目前，西昌专区民族工作中还有很多问题，这些问题是：
    （一）在已经实行民族区域自治及成立了民族民主联合政府的地区，今后的主要问题是真正建立和充实自治区自治机关及民族民主联合政府的工作内容；切实帮助自治区自治机关中少数民族干部进行工作，使民族民主联合政府中的少数民族干部有职有权；切实发挥自治区机关和民族民主联合政府的作用来为各民族人民服务。现在已实行区域自治地区的自治机关还不能完全根据民族特点切实发挥其应有的作用。民族民主联合政府布置和指导工作，还很一般化，有的部门对少数民族地区急待解决的问题还注意不够。自治机关和民族民主联合政府中的汉族干部还存有包办代替的作风。这些问题如不能得到适当解决，民族区域自治及民族民主联合政府的政策还不能说是彻底实行，我们必须加以注意。
    （二）目前民族不团结的现象仍在若干地区存在着。解决这一问题的办法，除了继续彻底消灭土匪、特务、继续调解民族间和民族内部的纠纷外，主要地应是克服大民族主义倾向和狭隘民族主义倾向。这两种倾向不仅在各族人民中实际存在着，而且在干部中也存在着。不能克服干部中的这两种倾向，就无法教育人民克服这两种倾向。在这两种倾向中，大民族主义倾向在目前还是主要的。所以今后主要地应是要求汉族干部克服大民族主义的倾向，同时也应要求兄弟民族干部警惕、防止和克服狭隘民族主义倾向。为此，对大民族主义及狭隘民族主义倾向的本质要进行经常的揭露和批判。某些汉族干部认为有大民族主义倾向不算什么了不起的错误，而不去认真加以克服，甚至对上级指示也采取不理的态度，这种错误思想和错误行为必须纠正。
    （三）发展各兄弟民族地区的生产已经成为今后的主要工作。只有抓紧这一工作，才能逐步改善各族人民的物质生活和文化生活，使各族人民更进一步认识毛主席的民族政策的伟大，认识祖国的可爱。但有些干部对这一问题还没有给予足够的注意，特别是民族杂居地区的干部把大部力量集中在汉区的生产工作上，对少数民族地区的生产不加注意，这是急需加以纠正的。
    （四）各少数民族地区的社会改革必将会逐渐地不可避免地被提出来。对这一问题，我们必须依据各族人民及和人民有联系的领袖人物的志愿，采取谨慎的切合实际情况的政策，并经过各民族人民自己，逐步地有计划地去进行。不应要求过急，更不应由汉族干部包办代替。过去曾经有过不少同志在这一问题上采取了轻率的态度，对有关各民族的一些问题处理得不恰当，土匪、特务及地主恶霸即乘机造谣煽动，给各族人民平添了不少顾虑。这些缺点今后不应重复。
