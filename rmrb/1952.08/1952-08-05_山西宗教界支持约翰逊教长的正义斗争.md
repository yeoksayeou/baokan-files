    [This article reports that] The Shanxi Christian Resist-America Aid-Korea Three-Self Reform Preparatory Committee, the Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province Catholic Three-Self Reform General Association, and the Taiyuan City Christian United Association jointly issued a protest on July 28, unanimously condemning the ugly behavior of the British ruling class and its kept newspapers in persecuting and slandering Reverend Johnson. The protest stated: "We, all peace-loving and loyal Christians and Catholics in Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City, wholeheartedly support the Archbishop of Canterbury Johnson and his speech at the press conference held in London, England on July 8, and unanimously protest the ugly behavior of slandering and persecuting Reverend Johnson." The three organizations also wrote letters to Reverend Johnson and his wife to express their condolences. The letter stated: "We, the Christians and Catholics of New China, deeply know that you have a spirit of great fearlessness, and no slander or persecution can shake your confidence in defending peace. We must resolutely support your just actions and fight to the end for the peace and happiness of all mankind."
