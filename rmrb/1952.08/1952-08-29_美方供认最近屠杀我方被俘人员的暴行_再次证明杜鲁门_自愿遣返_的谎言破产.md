    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 27th: A special correspondent of this agency reports: Just as Harrison and Truman were talking glibly about "not using bayonets to force the repatriation of prisoners of war," the U.S. military continued to kill and injure prisoners of war on Geoje Island and Jeju Island this month.
    News of the latest massacre of prisoners of war detained by the U.S. side was suppressed for two weeks, allowing Harrison and Truman to talk glibly about "humanitarian and moral considerations" under a news blackout. However, after Beijing Radio recently revealed the fact that the U.S. side killed fifteen and injured forty Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Busan on August 15th last year, the lid on this blockade was suddenly lifted. The U.S. Eighth Army, fearing that the recent killings and injuries of prisoners of war in August might have become known to the world, inadvertently leaked to American reporters yesterday that grenades, tear gas, and grenade launchers were used against prisoners of war on Geoje Island and Jeju Island in "five" incidents from August 11th to August 24th. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. press officer "probably had the impression" that Beijing Radio was referring to "this year's incident."
    Conflicting news released after U.S. censorship reveals that many facts are still being deliberately kept secret. The news did not mention whether they were Korean People's Army prisoners of war or Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. However, everyone knows that there are 13,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war on Jeju Island who Harrison said were "unwilling to return home." A United Press International report said that the prisoners of war were killed and injured because "they held demonstrations aimed at embarrassing the United Nations Command," but how they "embarrassed" the United Nations Command was not explained at all. Obviously, the demonstrations were very embarrassing for Harrison and Truman because the prisoners of war still wanted to go home, regardless of American guns and bayonets. The figures published by British and American news agencies are full of contradictions. An Associated Press report on August 26th said that the U.S. Eighth Army announced that since August 11th, one prisoner of war had been killed and 52 injured, and the most recent incident occurred on August 23rd. The next day, a United Press International report said that the Eighth Army announced that in August, five prisoners of war were killed and 24 injured, and the most recent incident occurred on "last Sunday" – the 24th. The same report said that two prisoners of war were killed while "attempting to escape." However, a Reuters report on the same day said that the Eighth Army announced that "four prisoners of war were killed and 64 injured," and "three of the four dead were shot while attempting to escape." The U.S. Eighth Army said that none of the 38 prisoners of war injured on Geoje Island on August 11th were "seriously injured," but then said, "seven people have been sent to the hospital."
    The "reasons" they gave for shooting and killing prisoners of war are varied. The Associated Press said it was "collective singing demonstrations." United Press International said it was "throwing stones at guards." Reuters added: "Another prisoner of war drowned while trying to swim away." However, all of these reports show that these unarmed prisoners of war were brutally shot. None of these news agencies explain why the prisoners of war held "demonstrations," while Harrison and Truman claimed that they did not want to go home.
    The question is, how many incidents of massacre of prisoners of war have not been revealed under the U.S. news blackout? The answer to this question can be found in Harrison's recent remarks to reporters, when he said: "I don't have as many prisoners in my hands as they demand to be repatriated, specifically 20,000 Chinese prisoners they demand to be repatriated."
    For months, Truman and the American representatives at Panmunjom have been repeating their stale lies that they "do not want to use bayonets to force the repatriation of prisoners of war." But since February, American and British news agencies have been reporting monthly on the continuous shooting and killing of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by American troops on Geoje Island and the mainland. Since August of last year, the bloody figures of Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war killed and injured each month, which have been revealed, eloquently illustrate their unyielding struggle to demand to go home despite the threat of American guns and cannons. Over the past year, mountains of ironclad evidence of bloodshed and sacrifice have accumulated, and the lies used by Harrison and Truman to bring the armistice negotiations to a complete breakdown have long been bankrupt.

    美方供认最近屠杀我方被俘人员的暴行　
　  再次证明杜鲁门“自愿遣返”的谎言破产
    【新华社开城二十七日电】本社特派记者报道：正当哈利逊和杜鲁门高谈“不要用刺刀强迫遣返战俘”的时候，美军本月仍在继续杀害和残伤巨济岛和济州岛上的战俘。
    对于美方所拘留的战俘的最近一次屠杀的消息被扣压了两个星期，使哈利逊和杜鲁门能在新闻封锁下高谈“人道和道义的考虑”。但是在北京广播最近揭露了美方在去年八月十五日在釜山杀死十五个、残伤四十个朝鲜人民军战俘的事实以后，这个封锁的盖子就陡然揭开了。美国第八军害怕最近在八月间杀害和残伤战俘的事也许已为世人所知，昨天无意中向美国记者泄露了在八月十一日到八月二十四日的“五次”事件中曾用手榴弹、催泪弹和掷弹枪对付巨济岛和济州岛上的战俘。据美联社称，美国新闻发布官“大概是有这样的印象”，以为北京广播所指的是“本年的这次事件”。
    经过美方检查后而发出来的互相矛盾的消息透露：还有许多事实是仍然故意不使大家知道。消息中没有提到是朝鲜人民军战俘或中国人民志愿军战俘。但是，大家都知道，在济州岛上有一万三千名哈利逊所说的“不愿回家的”中国人民志愿军战俘。一条合众社的消息说：战俘之被杀伤是由于“他们举行旨在使联合国军司令部为难的示威”，可是他们如何使联合国军司令部“为难”却一点也没有加以解释。很明显的，示威之所以使哈利逊和杜鲁门十分为难，是由于战俘们不顾美国的枪和刺刀，仍然要回家去。英美通讯社所发表的数字彼此矛盾百出。美联社八月二十六日的一则消息说，美国第八军宣布，自从八月十一日以后，一名战俘被击毙，五十二名受伤，最近一次事件是在八月二十三日发生的。第二天，合众社消息说，第八军宣布，在八月份，五名战俘被击毙，二十四名受伤，最近一次事件发生在“上个星期日”——二十四日。同一则消息说，两名战俘在“企图逃跑”时被击毙。但是，同日路透社的一则消息说，第八军宣布“四名战俘被击毙，六十四名受伤”，“四名死者中有三名是在企图逃跑时被枪杀的”。美国第八军说，八月十一日巨济岛上受伤的三十八名战俘中，没有一个是“重伤”，但是接着又说，“七个人已被送进医院”。
    他们举出的枪杀和杀害战俘的“理由”是五花八门的。美联社说是“集体唱歌示威”。合众社说是“向看守兵抛石头”。路透社又加上说：“又有一名战俘是在企图游泳逃跑时淹死的。”但是，所有的这些消息说明，这些赤手空拳的战俘们是被残酷地枪杀了。这些通讯社都不说明战俘为什么举行“示威”，而哈利逊和杜鲁门却宣称，他们不愿意回家。
    问题是，在美国的新闻封锁下还有多少屠杀战俘的事件没有透露出来。从哈利逊最近向记者发表的谈话中可以找到这个问题的答案，他说：“我手中没有他们要求遣返的那么许多俘虏，具体说来就是他们要求遣返的二万名中国俘虏。”
    几个月以来，杜鲁门和板门店的美国代表一直在重复着他们的陈腐不堪的谎言，说他们“不要用刺刀强迫遣返战俘”。但是自从二月以来，美国和英国的通讯社每月都曾报道美国军队在巨济岛及大陆上不断枪击及屠杀朝中战俘的消息。从去年八月起，已经透露出来的每月被杀及受伤的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战俘的鲜血淋漓的数字，雄辩地说明了他们不顾美国的枪炮威胁而进行的要求回家的不屈不挠的斗争。一年以来，流血和牺牲性命的铁证堆积如山，哈利逊和杜鲁门用来使停战谈判走向完全破裂的谎言早已破产了。
