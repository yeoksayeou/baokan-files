Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: Soviet newspapers published commentaries on the 1st to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, according to a TASS dispatch from Moscow.

    The editorial in "Izvestia" stated: The establishment of the Chinese People's Armed Forces is an outstanding event in the lives of the Chinese people and has decisively influenced the future course of the Chinese revolution. With a revolutionary army, the Chinese people possessed an organized armed force, which was one of the decisive conditions for the victory of the Chinese workers and peasants in their struggle for freedom and independence. The editorial pointed out: The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Mao Zedong, paid great attention to the development of the Chinese People's Armed Forces. The People's Liberation Army has gradually grown into a force that cannot be easily despised by China's internal and external enemies. Since its establishment, this army has consistently fought faithfully for the interests of the people, for China's national independence, and for the country's liberation from the oppression of feudal landlords and foreign imperialists. In the battles against the Japanese invaders, the Chinese People's Liberation Army demonstrated outstanding skills in continuously and increasingly heavily striking the enemy on all fronts. After the end of World War II, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, from 1946 to 1949, defeated the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary forces supported by American imperialism and ensured the victory of the great Chinese people in defeating the combined forces of domestic and foreign reactionaries, a victory of world historical significance.

    The editorial then gave examples of how the Chinese people, having broken free from the chains of imperialism and feudal servitude and inspired by the ideas of Marxism and Leninism, began to build a new life. In the years since the victory of the people's revolution, the Chinese people have made remarkable achievements in the political and economic fields. The Chinese People's Liberation Army reliably safeguards the national independence of the People's Republic of China, protecting the peaceful construction work of the Chinese people from the conspiracies of domestic and foreign reactionaries. The American new war instigators are intensifying their criminal activities that endanger international peace and security. The noble undertaking of the Chinese People's Volunteers in assisting the Korean people in resisting American interventionists will be forever remembered.

    The editorial concluded: While celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, united around the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, they vigilantly defend the right of the Chinese people to peaceful labor, the sacred borders of the country, and the freedom and national independence of the People's Republic of China.

    "Red Star" published a commemorative article stating: From the first day of its birth, the Chinese People's Revolutionary Army has maintained close ties with the people and represents their vital interests. The Chinese working people joined their army in order to achieve the noble goal of combating the exploiters, traitors of the people, foreign imperialist invaders, and their Kuomintang agents. The great revolutionary ideas of liberation inspired the soldiers of the Liberation Army to create many brave collective heroic feats and gave them the strength to overcome all difficulties and observe the strictest revolutionary discipline. The Chinese People's Liberation Army was established and meticulously nurtured by the glorious Chinese Communist Party. Among the founders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, his comrade-in-arms, the brilliant military leader Zhu De, and other leaders of the Communist Party. Many members of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party worked in the ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Communists have carried out much political work in the Chinese People's Liberation Army; they are the core of its organization and unity. The leadership of the Communist Party is the decisive condition for the People's Liberation Army to achieve victory in fighting the enemy and in promoting the Chinese people's revolution. On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Soviet people warmly wish the Chinese people further victories in building a new life.

    苏联报纸著论庆祝我国“八一”建军节
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联报纸在一日发表评论纪念中国人民解放军建军二十五周年。
    “消息报”的社论说：中国人民武装部队的建立，是中国人民的生活中一个突出的事件，并且有决定意义地影响了中国革命的未来进程。有了革命军队，中国人民就有了有组织的武装力量，而这种武装力量是中国工人和农民争取自由和独立的斗争取得胜利的决定性条件之一。社论指出：以毛泽东为首的中国共产党中央委员会，对于中国人民武装部队的发展加以极大的注意。人民解放军逐渐成长成为一支中国内外敌人所不能轻侮的力量。这支军队自从建立以来，一贯是为着人民的利益、为着中国的民族独立、为着国家摆脱封建地主和外国帝国主义者的压迫而忠贞不渝地进行战斗。中国人民解放军在反对日本侵略者的战斗中，在前线各地表现了连续地、越来越沉重地打击敌人的卓越技巧。在第二次世界大战结束以后，英勇的中国人民解放军在一九四六年到一九四九年期间，打垮了美帝国主义所支援的蒋介石国民党反动派的军队，并保证了伟大的中国人民击败国内外反动派的联合力量而取得具有世界历史意义的胜利。
    社论接着举例说明中国人民在摆脱帝国主义和封建奴役的锁链后，在马克思主义和列宁主义的思想的鼓舞下，开始建设新生活的情形。在人民革命胜利以来的几年中，中国人民已经在政治和经济方面取得了显著的成就。中国人民解放军可靠地保障着中华人民共和国的民族独立，保护着中国人民的和平建设劳动，免受国内外反动派的阴谋的侵害。美国新战争挑拨者正在加紧危害国际和平和安全的罪恶活动。中国人民志愿军为了援助朝鲜人民抵抗美国干涉者进行了英勇斗争，这种崇高的业绩将永垂史册。
    社论最后说：中国人民解放军在庆祝建军二十五周年的时候，团结在中华人民共和国中央人民政府和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东的周围，警觉地保卫着中国人民已经得到的和平劳动的权利和国家神圣的边疆，以及中华人民共和国的自由和民族独立。
    “红星报”发表纪念文章说：中国人民革命军队从诞生的第一天起就一直和人民密切联系着，并且代表着人民的切身利益。中国劳动人民参加了他们的军队，以便达到打击剥削者、人民叛徒、外国帝国主义侵略者和他们的国民党代理人的崇高目的。伟大的争取解放的革命思想鼓舞解放军战士创造出许多勇敢的集体英雄主义的丰功伟业，并给他们以克服一切困难和遵守最严格的革命纪律的力量。中国人民解放军是光荣的中国共产党建立起来并关怀备至地培养起来的。在中国人民解放军的创立者中间有中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东，他的战友、天才的军事领袖朱德，以及共产党的其他领袖们。中国共产党中央委员会的许多委员都是在中国人民解放军的队伍中工作的。共产党员在中国人民解放军中进行了许多政治工作，他们是它的组织和团结的核心。共产党的领导是人民解放军在对敌作战中和在推动中国人民革命中取得胜利的决定性条件。值此中国人民解放军建军二十五周年之际，苏联人民热烈地预祝中国人民在建设新的生活方面取得进一步的胜利。
