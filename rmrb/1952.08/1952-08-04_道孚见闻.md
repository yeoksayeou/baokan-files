We spent the New Year in Daofu. Daofu is located 460 li northwest of Kangding and 330 li northwest of Ganzi. The county has a population of approximately 9,000. Apart from a few Han Chinese merchants in the town, the rest are all Tibetans.

The ancestors of the Tibetan compatriots here lived west of the Jinsha River before the Tang Dynasty. Later, after wars against the Tang Dynasty, they gradually migrated here. The local Han people are either merchants from Sichuan and Shaanxi, or soldiers who drifted here in the past. Most of them have now married Tibetan wives and have children. They generally not only speak fluent Tibetan, but also have similar clothing and living habits to the Tibetans. These Han people initially joined Tibetan society often out of desperation in life, because under the Kuomintang's reactionary ethnic policies, ordinary Tibetans had no social rights. If Han people joined Tibetan society, it was tantamount to voluntarily lowering themselves. After liberation, this situation changed greatly. Once we met a middle-aged man wearing Tibetan clothes. At first, he claimed to be a local Tibetan, but after observing his face, we always felt some difference from ordinary Tibetans. He could also speak fluent Chinese. After repeated inquiries, we learned that he was originally from Chengdu, Sichuan. After liberation, he saw that the social status of Tibetan compatriots had greatly changed. The People's Government and the passing troops gave Tibetan compatriots all kinds of help, which he greatly envied, so he claimed to be a Tibetan.

The largest building in Daofu town is the Lama Temple, which is almost as large as the entire residential area of the town. We were hosted in the county government, the shell of which was a relic of the Kuomintang reactionary government. It was built on the eastern slope of a mountain far from the main road, with a dilapidated bunker nearby, from which the whole town could be monitored. It is said that before liberation, all the officials here were Han Chinese. Apart from demanding grain, money, and corvée labor, they never met with Tibetans in peacetime. The reception staff pulled a wooden board from the corner to make a bed for us. It was a plaque engraved with the words "Virtue and Majesty Combined." The receptionist said, "What virtue and majesty? They all came as skinny dogs and left as fat pigs!"

Now, presiding over the county's political affairs in this county government are three Tibetan county heads and a military representative of the People's Liberation Army. The head county head, Natuo, is a Living Buddha from the local Lingque Temple, over fifty years old, wearing a red kasaya. The two deputy county heads, Dongmen Danba and Yamma Wangxiu, were famous leaders of two Tibetan tribes in the county, who had been incompatible with each other before liberation. After they were elected as deputy county heads of the People's Government, they eliminated their prejudices with the help of the military representative and got along very well.

Comrade Zhao Xuegang, the military representative, is a shrewd and capable Communist Party member in his twenties. Now, based on the Party's ethnic policies and his own rich experience in local work, he is helping the three Tibetan leaders to carry out their work.

We spent the New Year in this Tibetan area and felt a different kind of flavor. Although ordinary Tibetan compatriots in the countryside have not yet had the custom of celebrating the Gregorian New Year, the town is different after all. Residents and lamas on the street jointly organized a shehuo performance. They played lions, tiger-headed men, plus deafening gongs and drums, followed by Tibetan men and women in red and green, adding infinite joy to this peaceful winter plateau. Tibetan girls used various fruits to arrange the ten characters "Support the Communist Party, Support Chairman Mao" in the courtyard of the county government. Chairman Mao's portrait was enthusiastically surrounded and held high by groups of girls. Their joyful and bright eyes, with respect and gratitude, looked at the giant who is guiding our people of all ethnic groups to happiness day by day.

On the afternoon of New Year's Day, the sun was shining and the wind was gentle. The military representative and County Head Dongmen invited us to ride horses to the countryside to take a look. We had long heard of the high riding skills of ordinary Tibetans. County Head Dongmen was even more of an expert rider among Tibetans. He took the lead, and we followed closely behind. In a flash, the yellow earth was rolling, and we had jumped into the crisscrossing fields.

We rode side by side on the bank of a river called the Xianshui River. This river is a tributary of the Yalong River. In winter, it is dozens of feet wide and can be used to build canals to irrigate the farmland on both sides in the future. There are many fish in the river, and they are all big fish. Unfortunately, the Lama Temple prohibits catching them with nets, otherwise residents on both sides could have more income. We saw two Han Chinese holding fishing rods to fish. This fishing method is quite special. A reel is attached to the end of the rod. After throwing the line into the water, the reel is slowly turned to slowly retract the hook line. Because the fish are floating and unsteady in the rapid current, if they accidentally touch the hook, it is difficult to escape. After watching for a while, we saw them catch three big fish in a row, each weighing two or three catties. The shape of this fish is similar to that of the Yellow River carp, with a wide body and golden color, and the meat is very tender. Pork in Daofu sells for 16,000 yuan per catty, while fish prices are only a quarter of the price of meat. People who have not been to the Western Sichuan Plateau may find it hard to imagine that fish production in Western Sichuan is so abundant.

On the hillside not far from the river, there are several small flags inserted, which is the Tibetan sky burial site. When Tibetans die, there are four types of burials: sky burial, cremation, water burial, and burial. Cremation is more expensive, so most Tibetans, except for princes and nobles, use sky burial and water burial. The so-called sky burial is to transport the deceased to the sky burial site, first invite the lama to chant scriptures, and then dissect the corpse into several pieces for wild eagles to peck at. Water burial is to dissect the deceased and throw them into the water. Burial is only occasionally used in families near the city that are more deeply influenced by the Han people. County Head Dongmen told us: Han people often use words like "cut into thousands of pieces after death" to curse people, while Tibetans curse people by saying "buried under the ground after death." The differences in customs between ethnic groups are so clearly manifested in all aspects.

In the evening, we were having dinner in the county government when a burst of rapid hoofbeats suddenly came from outside the door. A small horse team entered the courtyard of the county government. The military representative and the head and deputy county heads all stood up to greet them. The leader of this horse team was burly, wearing a large fox fur hat and a brocade Tibetan robe. The following few were wearing old sheepskin robes, their purplish-red arms exposed outside, and various guns hanging on their backs. They didn't dismount until they entered the gate. After being introduced, we learned that the leader was Wang Luo, the district head of the county's pasture area.

Daofu has two district governments below the county government, one is the agricultural area and the other is the pasture area. Wang Luo was originally a Tusi of the pasture area and was appointed as the district head after the establishment of the People's Government. He is forty years old this year and it was his first time to come to the city. People attach great importance to this matter because it shows his support for the People's Government. After dinner, we had a long talk. Although the questions and answers were translated by an interpreter, the sincerity and frankness of his expression gave people a very deep impression.

This pastoral leader first wanted us to convey his and his herders' gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He said that the lives of herders before liberation were unimaginably painful to ordinary people. There were at least dozens of kinds of exorbitant taxes every year. Feeding a yak required half a year of corvée labor. When the cow could not carry the load, the cow owner had to carry it himself, so for decades, the livestock and population in his tribe decreased year by year. Most of the old and weak herders died while supporting the corvée labor, and the young and strong fled to the mountains and took risks. At that time, bandits roamed, and mutual killings became a common phenomenon in the pasture area. When we asked about the situation in the pasture area after liberation, he said that the People's Government abolished exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies as soon as it was established, and the corvée system was abolished as soon as the Liberation Army arrived. Now, what the higher-level People's Government instructs is not to demand things from the herders, but to help them develop livestock and improve their lives. He said that his coming to the county this time was also for these things.

The district head of this pasture area very much hopes that reporters will go to his pasture to take a look. He said that the scope of that pasture area takes three days to ride a horse from one side to the other. Within that vast area, there are more than 30,000 yaks and thousands of horses. Before leaving, he repeatedly said: "The herders warmly welcome people from the People's Government."

    道孚见闻
    新华社记者  千峰
    我们留在道孚过了一个新年。道孚在康定西北四百六十里处，西北距甘孜三百三十华里，全县约有九千人口，除去城里有着寥寥可数的几个汉族商人，其他尽是藏族。
    这里的藏族同胞的祖先，在唐代以前住在金沙江的西面，以后经过对唐朝的战争，才逐渐迁移到这里。当地的汉人或为川陕一带来的行商，或为过去流落下来的军人。他们如今大多娶了藏族妻子，生了儿女，一般不仅能说流利的藏语，并且服装和生活习惯都和藏人相似。这些汉人最初加入藏族社会，往往由于在生活上迫不得已，因为当时在国民党的反动民族政策之下，一般藏人没有任何社会权利，汉人如果加入藏族社会，无异自愿低人一等。解放以后，这种情形大不相同了。有一次我们遇到一个着藏装的中年男子，他起初自称本地藏人，以后我们观察他的面部，总觉和一般藏人有些差别，他又能说流利的汉话，后来经过再三询问，才知道他原来是四川成都人。解放后他看到藏族同胞的社会地位大大变化，人民政府和过境部队处处给藏族同胞以种种帮助，使他大为羡慕，因此自称藏人。
    道孚城里最大的建筑是喇嘛庙，面积几与全城的整个居民区相等。我们被招待在县政府内，这个县政府的外壳，是国民党反动政府的遗物，它建筑在离开大路很远的东山坡上，附近有一座残破的碉堡，从这里可监视全城。据说解放前在这里做官的全是汉人，他们除去要粮要款和要乌拉（派杂差），平时从不和藏人见面。招待人员从墙角里拉出一块木板给我们搭铺，那是一块刻着“德威兼备”字样的匾额，招待员说：“什么德威不德威，他们来时都是瘦狗，走时都成了肥猪！”
    现在在这个县政府里主持全县政务的，是三个藏族县长和一个人民解放军的军事代表。正县长那托是当地灵雀寺的活佛，五十多岁，身着红色袈裟。两个副县长东门丹巴和亚麻汪秀本是县里两个藏人部落中著名的首领，解放前一向互不相容。他们当选人民政府的副县长后，在军事代表的帮助下消除了成见，相处得很融洽。
    军事代表赵学刚同志是一个二十六岁的精明强干的共产党员，现在他根据党的民族政策和他本人的丰富的地方工作经验，帮助着三个藏族领袖进行工作。
    我们在这藏族地区过年，觉得别有一种风味。虽然在乡下一般藏胞还没有过阳历年的习惯，但城里毕竟不同，街上的居民和喇嘛联合办了一次社火，他们扮演狮子、虎头人，加上喧天的锣鼓，后头跟着穿红挂绿的藏男藏女，给这平静的冬季高原上增添了无限的欢乐景象。藏族少女们在县政府的庭院里用各色果品摆成了“拥护共产党，拥护毛主席”十个大字，毛主席的画像被成群的少女们热烈地簇拥着，高举着，她们欢乐的明媚的眼睛，带着崇敬和感激，望着引导着我们各族人民日益走向幸福的那个巨人。
    元旦下午日丽风和，军事代表和东门县长邀我们骑马到野外看看。一般藏人骑术的高强我们素有所闻，东门县长更是藏人中骑马的能手，他一马当先，我们在后面紧紧追随，刹时间黄土滚腾，我们已跃入阡陌纵横的田野中。
    我们并马在一条叫鲜水河的河畔上，这条河水是雅砻江的支源，冬季宽达数丈，将来很可以修筑渠道灌溉两岸的农田。河里鱼类很多，并且都是大鱼，可惜喇嘛庙禁止用网捕捉，否则两岸居民可以更多一层收入。我们曾见两个汉人手持钓竿钓鱼，这种钓鱼的方式相当特别，竿的末端系着一个轮轴，把线抛入水中后，将轮轴慢慢转动，钩线便慢慢向回收缩。因为鱼在急水中浮游不定，偶一不慎触到钩上，便再也难得逃脱。我们看了一会工夫，就见他们连连钓上三条大鱼，每条都以二三斤计。这种鱼的形状和黄河鲤鱼相似，身宽色金，肉很鲜嫩。道孚的猪肉卖一万六千一斤，而鱼价只抵肉价四分之一，没到过西康高原上的人，恐怕很难想像到鱼产在西康也是这样丰富。
    离河不远的山坡上插着几竿小旗，那是藏人的天葬场。藏人死了有天葬、火葬、水葬、土葬四种葬法。火葬费用较大，除王公贵族之外一般藏人都用天葬和水葬。所谓天葬，就是把死者运到天葬的场所，先请喇嘛念经，然后把死尸解剖为数块，让野鹰啄食。水葬是把死者解剖后抛入水中。土葬仅在城池附近受汉人影响较深的人家偶然使用。东门县长告诉我们：汉人常用死后千刀万剐一类的话来骂人，而藏人骂人则说死了埋在地底下。民族之间风俗习惯的不同，这样显明地表现在各个方面。
    晚间我们正在县政府中聚餐的时候，门外忽然传来一阵急促的马蹄声。一个小小的马队走进了县政府的院子，军事代表和正副县长都起立相迎。这个马队里为首的一个身材魁梧，头戴大狐皮帽，身穿锦缎藏袍，随后的几个着老羊皮袍子，紫红的胳膊袒露在外面，背上挂着长短各种枪枝。他们直到进了大门才滚鞍下马，经介绍后我们才知道为首的那人是县牧场区区长汪洛。
    道孚在县政府以下设有两个区政府，一个是农业区，一个是牧场区，汪洛原是牧场区的土司，人民政府成立后才被委任为区长。他今年四十岁，还是生平第一次到城里来。人们很重视这件事情，因为这表示他对人民政府的拥护。饭后我们作了一次长谈，问话和答话虽然都靠通司来翻译，但他说话时那种真诚和坦率的表情，却给人以极深刻的印象。
    这个牧民领袖首先要我们转达他和他的牧民对共产党和毛主席的感激。他说解放前的牧民生活有着外间一般人想像不到的痛苦，每年苛捐杂税最少几十种，喂一头牦牛要出半年乌拉，出乌拉时，牛驮不动了，就得叫牛主自己背着走，因此几十年来，他的部落里牲畜和人口逐年逐月地减少，老弱的牧民大都在支派乌拉时死亡，年轻力壮的逃到深山里挺身走险。当时盗匪出没，互相残杀，成为牧场区的普遍现象。我们问到牧场区解放以后的情形，他说人民政府一成立就废除了苛捐杂税，乌拉制度在解放军一来到就取消了。现在上级人民政府所指示的不是从牧民那里索取东西，而是帮助他们发展牲畜和改善生活。他说他这一次到县里来也是为着这些事情。
    这个牧场区的区长很希望记者到他的牧场上去看看，他说那个牧场区的范围从这一边到那一边骑马走需要三天，在那个广大面积之内有着三万多头牦牛和上千只牧马。临别时他再三地说：“牧民们对于从人民政府里来的人，都是热烈欢迎的。”
