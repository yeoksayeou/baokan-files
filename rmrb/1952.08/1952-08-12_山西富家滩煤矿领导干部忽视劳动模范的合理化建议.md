    Shanxi Fujiatan Coal Mine Leaders Neglect Labor Model's Rationalization Proposals
    Editor: In the Yunjia Ping pit of the Shanxi Fujiatan Coal Mine, due to the lack of mechanical equipment, the coal produced in the pit had to be transported to the station five miles away by horse-drawn carts. This required 68 horse-drawn carts every day, and the coal lost from the carts due to bumps on the way exceeded 10 tons every day. At the same time, the coal dust accumulated on the road for a long time would also affect the health of the workers.

    Kang Yongxiang, a Shanxi Provincial Labor Model, suggested several times last year to improve the transportation route by connecting the Yunjia Ping pit with the adjacent horizontal pit, Zuowujing, so that the coal could be transported out by machine from the horizontal pit. However, the administrative leaders of this mine suffered from serious bureaucratism and failed to accept this suggestion in a timely manner. It was not until April of this year that they conducted measurements based on Kang Yongxiang's suggestion and proved that Kang Yongxiang's opinion was entirely applicable.

    Now, Zuowujing and Zuobajing in these two pits have been connected. If the entire project is completed, it is estimated that it can save the country a total of 989.9 million yuan in transportation and coal loss expenses in the second half of this year. However, the leaders of this mine have not yet vigorously supported this work, and the work has not yet been put on the right track, thus delaying the time. We suggest that the leaders of this mine should quickly organize forces to carry out track-laying work, so as to promote the early completion of the entire project.

    山西富家滩煤矿领导干部忽视劳动模范的合理化建议
    编辑同志：山西富家滩煤矿云家坪坑，因为缺少机械装置，过去坑内所出的煤，都得用马车运往相距五里远的车站上。这样每日需六十八辆马车，且沿途震荡，煤从车上落下，每日损失在十吨以上。同时路上长时期积蓄的煤尘，也会影响职工身体健康。
    山西省劳动模范康永祥，去年曾几次建议改进运搬路，将云家坪坑与毗邻的水平坑左五径贯通一气，由水平坑用机器运出。但这个矿的行政领导干部有严重的官僚主义，没有及时接受这个建议。直至今年四月间，才根据康永祥的建议，进行测量，并证明康永祥的意见完全适用。
    现在这两坑内左五径左八径已打通，如果工程全部完成，估计今年后半年可给国家节约运搬费及煤损费共九亿八千九百余万元。但目前这个矿的领导干部还没有大力支持这项工作，迄今工作未上轨道，因而拖延了时间。我们建议这个矿领导干部应迅速组织力量进行铺轨工作，以促使全部工程及早完成。
