Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, August 5th: The Chinese Red Cross delegation attending the 18th International Red Cross Conference held a press conference on the afternoon of the 4th in their rooms at the King Edward Hotel. More than 30 journalists from the Soviet Union, Britain, France, the United States, and Canada, as well as representatives from the Australian and Canadian Red Cross Societies, attended the conference. The journalists were invited to see evidence of American military atrocities and germ warfare, as well as the lenient treatment of prisoners of war by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    After the journalists' visit, Li Dequan, the chief delegate of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, made a statement. She pointed out that the evidence brought by the delegation to prove the crimes of the United States in violating the Geneva Convention and the Geneva Protocol could not all be exhibited. She said: "As you all know, we have repeatedly requested the conference authorities to submit all the evidence to the conference for review. However, the conference authorities refused our request and even refused to give us technical assistance such as film projectors and suitable rooms. Therefore, it is impossible to show films here about the US conducting germ warfare and our lenient treatment of prisoners of war. I am sure you will feel as sorry as I do. The unfair attitude of some people presiding over the conference further proves that they are afraid of the truth, afraid of exposing the US conducting germ warfare; those who have committed germ warfare crimes are afraid of letting everyone examine the evidence. No paper can contain fire, and no obstruction, news blockade, slander, or distortion can forever cover up the truth.”

    After the reporters asked some questions about germ warfare, its evidence, and investigation suggestions at the conference and received answers, the reporters listened to the recorded confessions of captured American pilots Quinn and Enoch admitting to participating in germ warfare. Everyone who attended the press conference received a document, photos, and pamphlets about exposing the US military's germ warfare.

    我国红十字会代表团在加举行记者招待会
    邀请各国记者参观侵朝美军暴行和进行细菌战的证据
    【新华社多伦多五日电】出席第十八届国际红十字大会的中国红十字会代表团于四日下午在他们居住的国家约克饭店的房间内举行记者招待会。参加招待会的有苏联、英国、法国、美国和加拿大的三十多个记者和澳大利亚、加拿大红十字会代表。记者们被邀参观美军暴行和细菌战以及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军宽待战俘的证据。
    中国红十字会代表团首席代表李德全在记者们参观后发表谈话。她指出：代表团带来的证明美国破坏日内瓦公约和日内瓦议定书的罪行的证据，无法全部展览。她说：“诸位都知道，我们曾一再要求大会当局把所有证据提供大会审查。但是大会当局拒绝了我们的要求，甚至拒绝给予我们诸如电影放映机和适当的房间之类的技术帮助。因此，就无法在这里放映关于美国进行细菌战和我们宽待战俘的电影。我确信诸位会像我一样地感到遗憾。主持大会的某些人们的不公正的态度，进一步证明了他们害怕真理，害怕揭发美国进行细菌战；那些犯了细菌战罪行的人们害怕让大家来审查证据。没有纸能够包得住火的，任何阻挠、新闻封锁、诽谤和歪曲，都不能永远掩盖住真理。”
    在记者提出了一些关于细菌战、它的证据和大会上的调查建议的问题并得到了答复以后，记者们倾听被俘美国飞行员奎恩和伊纳克供认参加细菌战的供词录音。参加记者招待会的每一个人都得到了一份文件、照片、和有关揭露美军进行细菌战的小册子。
