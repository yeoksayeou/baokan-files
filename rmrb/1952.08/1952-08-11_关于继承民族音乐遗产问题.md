On the Question of Inheriting National Musical Heritage
Li Ling

The issue of "inheriting national musical heritage" has attracted attention from all relevant parties, which is very exciting. However, it should be pointed out that the understanding of this issue among music workers is still confused.

Some revolutionary music workers, because they demand that music serve the broad masses of the people and unite with the people, have long recognized the need to learn from folk music. Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, and other revolutionary music workers made efforts in this direction, creating many progressive and national-style works that were loved by the people, such as "Dǎ Chángjiāng" ( 打长江 ) [Attack the Yangtze River] (Nie Er), "Production Chorus," and "Yellow River Cantata" (Xian Xinghai). After the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942, everyone's efforts in this area deepened, and creations such as "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" and "The White Haired Girl"... are the results of moving forward in this direction. However, some people have a one-sided understanding of learning from the national musical heritage, that is, they only regard folk music as a national heritage and regard everything outside of folk music as the things of the scholar-officials, completely negating it.

People who have received bourgeois music education mostly despise or even reject national music. A music school teacher said painfully in a recent ideological remolding study: "In the past, if someone said I didn't understand Chinese music, I wouldn't be ashamed; but if they said I didn't understand Western music, I would consider it a great shame."

After liberation, the teaching policy of music education institutions changed, but the above-mentioned problem has not been widely valued. A very small number of music teachers have made some changes in their teaching content, but only a few folk songs are added to a series of foreign music textbooks. And the piano and orchestral departments still see no slight change.

A few teachers in the composition department have compiled composition methods based on folk music, although it is still very preliminary, it does not receive encouragement.

Recently, I went to a music department to give lectures. Although the students knew the necessity of learning national musical heritage in general terms, in reality, many people still despise it. In the symposium, several students said: "I don't think there is anything to learn from such simple and crude things." Among these people, some still worship some not-so-good Western musical pieces as idols with great reverence, and some even regard the second piece of the simplest and most elementary "Burgmüller" piano textbook as the "Bible," but they always have no good feelings for the excellent and rich musical art heritage of the motherland.

In the past, some of those who studied Chinese music, although they supported learning from the national musical heritage, only supported the so-called national music that evolved from "court music" and palace music. The songs they studied, practiced, and played were mostly things that embellished peace or sang about the wind and the moon in the old society. They did not adopt a critical attitude to accept these heritages, but treated them with a conservative national quintessence attitude. Their learning of music and the application of musical instruments not only rejected Western music, but also rejected folk music. These orchestras rarely play folk music, and even reject folk music. In the use of musical instruments, they only use instruments with relatively delicate sounds such as the erhu, pipa, bamboo flute, and xiao…, while rejecting commonly used folk instruments such as the suona, haidi, guanzi, sheng, banhu, and sanxian… which are energetic and have loud sounds. They do not accept fresh, vigorous, and healthy sounds, and only pursue the so-called "gentle and refined" of the scholar-officials.

In addition, a group of national music workers have realized that national music needs to be reformed and pursue progress. They have begun to learn from the folk, study and play folk tunes, which is good. However, because the issues of position, viewpoints, etc. have not been fundamentally resolved, many folk tunes, after being played by them, not only fail to express the people's thoughts and feelings, but even often change the nature of these excellent works.

People's thoughts are so confused on the issue of accepting the national music art heritage. Some blindly worship the West and blindly despise national art; some treat national music with a national quintessence attitude; and some completely negate national music. These incorrect attitudes are enough to hinder the development of China's new music and also hinder us from correctly treating the nation's musical heritage.

Now I would like to talk about the two most important aspects of the national musical heritage.

First, folk music, including folk songs, folk music, and local operas, etc., is the most important aspect of the national musical heritage. "China's national art heritage and traditions still live among the broad masses of the people, and it still has great and strong vitality. The people are constantly supplementing and enriching them with their own new creations; among them, local operas and folk songs are particularly worthy of our attention" (Zhou Yang: "The Tenth Anniversary of the Publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'"). The folk songs we often see, such as "Loading and Unloading Labor Song," "Sichuan River Labor Song," "Singing Chairman Mao by the Stove," "Youth Dance," "Busy with Production," local operas "Turning Over Taoist Rhymes," "Glorious Lantern," "Si Ping Tune" (Shandong), "Nanyin" (Guangdong), folk music "Releasing the Donkey," "Galloping Horse," "Little Peach Red"... are all vibrant people's sounds, and also demonstrate the people's extremely high artistic creativity.

Regarding folk music, some comrades have lumped it together in the "feudalism category," which is problematic. Although a very small number of folk music are things used by the feudal rulers to anesthetize the people, folk music is basically a reflection of the ideological life of the broad masses of the people. Here are the laboring people's songs of resistance such as "Ding Ying Shang" (顶硬上 ) [Stand Firm] (Guangdong), "Hiring Long-Term Workers," and "Miao Mountain Songs." Even general love songs, in terms of content and in the spirit of the tunes, nakedly express true and pure love and dissatisfaction with the feudal system. Isn't this a protest against feudal ethics? Aren't countless melodies that sue for the blood, tears, and suffering of life a resentment against the ruling class? Aren't those songs that blatantly sing out the people's will to resist a sign of the people's fighting spirit?

"Folk songs always closely accompany history, and they have their own opinions. Folk songs are completely divorced from pessimism. Although the lives of folk song authors are very hard, and their personal lives are oppressed and unsecured, the protagonists in folk songs are always the victors who overcome all the misfortunes of the world." (Gorky) Therefore, it is very necessary for us to correctly recognize the people's nature, healthiness, basic revolutionary nature against feudal rule, and artistic nature of folk music.

However, when we learn it as a heritage, we must also see its shortcomings, criticize and abandon its weaknesses and obscurities, accept its excellent parts, and develop and expand its healthy and cheerful parts, so that it can develop into new things that can express the ideological emotions and life needs of today's revolutionary reality. Like the "Sha Li Hong Ba" ( 沙里红巴 ) [name of a folk song] sung at a concert a few years ago, which was the song used by prostitutes to receive customers in the old society, and last year, a folk music team of a music school changed the name of the folk wedding and funeral song to "Celebrating the Communist Party" and performed it at the "July 1st" anniversary evening. And there is also the folk music "Joyful Song" (which is a catering to the low-level tastes of the petty bourgeoisie) that is often introduced at grand reception evenings, which are accepted without criticism. This is very wrong.

Second, as mentioned earlier, what we usually call national music refers to things that have evolved from "court music," and basically inherit from the "court music" of the feudal scholar-official class. A part of the national music is to sing praises or embellish peace, such as "An Le" ( 安乐 ) [Peace and Happiness], "Tai Ping Le" ( 太平乐 ) [Peaceful Music], "Wan Sui Le" ( 万岁乐 ) [Long Live Music], "Sheng Shou Le" ( 圣寿乐 ) [Imperial Birthday Music], "Guang Sheng Le" ( 光圣乐 ) [Glorious Sage Music]... Some of them have been lost, and some have been revised and renamed and are still circulating today. Many of the national music are works that sing about the wind and the moon. When we open "Ya Yin" or other scores and look at things like "Beauty Thinking of the Moon," "Hou Man Ting Fang," "Yang Chun," "Butterfly Love Flower"… they are all of this nature. Almost all the musical pieces in "Wen Ban Twelve Songs" are of this nature.

However, there are also many national music that come from the folk and still have some people's nature. Because many of the "court music" originally came from the folk, the feudal rulers collected some folk music and changed "developed" it into their own enjoyment. These things gradually dried up and became rigid, and the feudal rulers had to constantly absorb nourishment from the folk and re-"develop" it. The so-called "orthodox" music in ancient China and foreign countries is actually mainly sourced from folk music.

We know that folk music, due to the collection, sorting, and processing of musicians of past dynasties, is more regular and meticulous in the carving of musical art. The treasures kept here are very precious. Moreover, some ancient songs have been passed down from generation to generation, some of which are somewhat active things from the prosperous period of feudal society, and some of which have innovative factors in musical form. There are also things worth learning from this. Chairman Mao told us: "Even things from the feudal class and the bourgeoisie must be learned from." This should also be noted.

Now, we must act widely and quickly. All music academies and departments, and music work groups should establish or improve national music research organizations, and pay attention to the teaching of national music in creation and in various music courses. Singers and performers should also seriously learn the performance methods of singing and playing from folk national music, so that our creations and performances can better serve the people.

    关于继承民族音乐遗产问题
    李凌
    “继承民族音乐遗产”问题，已引起各有关方面的注意，这是很使人兴奋的。但应指出，音乐工作者对这问题的认识，还是混乱的。
    有些革命的音乐工作者，因为要求音乐为广大人民服务，和人民结合，早就认识到必须向民间音乐学习。聂耳，星海和其他革命音乐工作者就向这方面努力，创作了不少内容进步、有民族风格、为人民所喜爱的作品，如“打长江”（聂耳）、“生产大合唱”、“黄河大合唱”（星海）。一九四二年毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以后，大家在这方面的努力加深一步，“兄妹开荒”、“白毛女”……等创作就是沿着这个方向前进的成果。但也有人对学习民族音乐遗产有着片面的了解，就是只把民间音乐视为民族遗产，把民间音乐以外的东西，看作士大夫的东西，完全予以否定。
    受过资产阶级音乐教育的人，大都轻视甚至排斥民族音乐，有一个音乐学校教员，在最近的思想改造学习中痛心地说：“以前，如有人说我不懂中国音乐，我并不以为耻；要是说我不懂西洋音乐，我却认为奇耻大辱。”
    解放后，音乐教育机关的教学方针改变了，但上述的问题还没有得到广泛的重视。很少数音乐教师的教学内容有了一些改变，但也只是在一系列的外国音乐教材中，加入几首民歌。而钢琴，管弦乐系，仍然看不到些微的改变。
    作曲系的教师，已经有少数同志根据民间音乐编写作曲法，虽然还是很初步的，但却得不到鼓励。
    最近我到一个音乐系去讲课，同学们虽然笼统地知道学习民族音乐遗产的必要，但实际上，许多人依然轻视它。在座谈会上，就有几位同学说：“这样简单粗鲁的东西，觉得没有什么学头”。这些人中，有的还是必恭必敬的把一些并不高明的西洋乐曲当作偶像一样崇拜，有人甚至把最简单最初步的“布格缪拉”钢琴教材的第二首当作“圣经”，而对祖国优秀而丰富的音乐艺术遗产总是毫无好感。
    过去研究中国音乐的人，有一部分虽然是拥护学习民族音乐遗产，但是他们所拥护的只是从“雅乐”、宫庭音乐演进而来的所谓国乐。他们所研究、所练习、所演奏的曲子，大都是旧社会粉饰太平的或吟风弄月的东西，对于这些遗产，他们不是采取批判的态度来接受，而是采取保守的国粹主义的态度来对待它。他们对于音乐的学习及乐器的应用，不仅是排斥西洋的，而且是排斥民间的。这些乐队极少演奏民间音乐，甚至排斥民间音乐。在乐器的使用上，他们只用南胡、琵琶、曲笛、箫……等声音比较细致的乐器，而排斥民间常用的嗦喇、海笛、管子、笙、板胡、三弦……等有活力、声音宏亮的乐器。他们不接受新鲜的、泼剌的、健康的音响，只追求士大夫的所谓“温文尔雅”。
    另外有一部分国乐工作者，已经意识到国乐需要改革，追求进步，他们已开始向民间学习，研究和演奏民间的乐曲，这是好的。但由于立场、观点等问题还没有获得根本的解决，许多民间乐曲，经他们演奏，人民的思想情感不仅没有得到发挥，甚至常常使这些优秀的作品变了质。
    对于接受民族音乐艺术遗产问题，人们的思想是这样混乱。有些是盲目崇拜西洋，也盲目轻视民族艺术；有些是用国粹主义的态度对待国乐；有些则全部否定国乐。这些不正确的态度，都足以妨碍中国新音乐的发展，也妨碍我们正确地对待民族的音乐遗产。
    现在我想把民族音乐遗产最主要的两方面来谈谈。
    第一，民间音乐，包括民歌、民乐及地方戏曲等，这是民族音乐遗产最主要的一面。“中国民族艺术的遗产和传统，很多至今还活在广大人民中间，它还有极大的强烈的生命力，人民又不断地以自己的新的创作去补充和丰富它们；其中，地方戏曲和民歌，特别值得我们的重视”（周扬：“毛泽东同志‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’发表十周年”）。我们常见的民歌“装卸号子”、“川江号子”、“炉边歌唱毛主席”、“青春舞曲”、“生产忙”，地方戏曲“翻身道情”、“光荣灯”、“四平调”（山东）、“南音”（广东），民乐“放驴”、“走马”、“小桃红”……都是充满活力的人民音响，也表现了人民极高的艺术创造力。
    关于民间音乐，曾有些同志把它笼统地归在“封建主义范畴”，这是有问题的。民间音乐，虽然也有很少数是封建统治者麻醉人民的东西，但是，民间音乐基本上是广大人民的思想生活的反映。这里有劳动人民反抗歌声如“顶硬上”（广东）、“揽长工”、“苗家山歌”。即使一般情歌，在内容上，在歌调精神上，也是赤裸裸地表现了真纯的爱情和对封建制度的不满，这难道不是对封建礼教的抗议吗？无数诉唱生活中血泪和辛酸的音调，难道不是对统治阶级的怨恨吗？那些露骨地唱出人民反抗意志的歌篇，难道不是表示了人民的斗争精神吗？
    “民歌总是亲切的伴着历史，它们有自己的意见。民歌是跟悲观主义完全绝缘的。虽然民歌作者的生活是很苦的，其个人生活是受压迫的，无保障的，但民歌中的主人翁总是克服世界一切不幸的胜利者。”（高尔基）因此，我们正确地认识民间音乐的人民性，健康性，基本上对封建统治的革命性和它的艺术性是非常必要的。
    可是，当我们作为遗产来学习它的时候，也要看出它的不足，批判和扬弃它的软弱性，阴晦性，接受其优秀的部分，发挥扩大它的健康开朗的部分，使之发展成为能表现今天革命现实的思想情感，和生活需要的新东西。像前年有人把旧社会妓女接客的“沙里红巴”在音乐会演唱，去年一个音乐学校民乐队把民间婚丧曲改了名字叫“庆祝共产党”在纪念“七一”的晚会上演奏。还有最近常常在隆重的招待晚会上介绍的民乐“欢喜曲”（这是迎合小市民低级趣味的东西），都毫无批判地接受过来，这是非常错误的。
    第二，前面已经说过，我们通常所说的国乐，是指从“雅乐”演进而来的，基本上是从封建士大夫阶级的“雅乐”一脉相承而来的东西。国乐中有一部分是歌功颂德或粉饰太平的东西，如“安乐”、“太平乐”、“万岁乐”，“圣寿乐”、“光圣乐”……其中有些是失传了，有些经过辗转修正，改换了名称，到今天还流传着。国乐中不少是吟风弄月的作品。我们翻开“雅音”或其他曲谱看看，“美人思月”、“后满庭芳”、“阳春”、“蝶恋花”……一类东西，在在皆是。“文板十二曲”中几乎都是这类性质的乐曲。
    不过国乐中也有不少是来自民间的，多少还带有人民性的东西。因为“雅乐”本有许多是源自民间的，封建统治者，采集了一些民间音乐，改变“发展”成为他们自己的享乐品。这些东西渐渐干涸了，僵化了，封建统治者不能不常常向民间吸取滋养，重新加以“发展”。中外古代所谓“正统”音乐，实际上是以民间音乐为主要泉源的。
    我们知道，民间音乐，由于历代的音乐家的采集、整理、加工，在音乐艺术的雕琢上才比较工整、细致。这里面保有着的宝藏，是非常贵重的。还有，有些古曲世代相传，其中有些是封建社会兴旺时期多少带有积极性的东西，有些是在音乐形式上带有革新因素的东西。这其中也有值得借鉴的东西。毛主席告诉我们：“那怕是封建阶级与资产阶级的东西也必须借鉴。”这也是应该注意的。
    现在，我们必须广泛而迅速地行动起来。各音乐院系、音乐工作团体，都应该设立或健全民族音乐研究组织，在创作上、在各种音乐课程中重视民族音乐的教学。演唱及演奏工作者也要认真向民间国乐学习歌唱和演奏的表现方法，使我们的创作和演出，更好地为人民服务。
