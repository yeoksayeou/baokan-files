    Party Organizations Should Pay Attention to Promoting the Advanced Experience of the Leadership Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
    With the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, Party organizations in some areas have created many advanced leadership experiences in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Party organizations in all localities have the responsibility to support and promote these advanced leadership experiences with all their strength to push the mutual aid and cooperation movement forward.
    Judging from some materials, there are two situations in promoting advanced experiences: the first is that advanced experiences are valued, or relatively valued, and they are good at learning and promoting them. Liu Fulun, the branch secretary of Nanhe Village in Changzhi County, Shanxi, and Feng Shiduan, the secretary of the Changzhi Third District Committee of the Communist Party of China, belong to this type. When Wang Dingxiang proposed the establishment of a "Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meeting," Liu Fulun gave it his support. This method was finally successfully implemented, bringing the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Nanhe Village to a climax. Although Feng Shiduan initially regarded Wang Dingxiang's "Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meeting" as "a general working method" and believed that "there is no need to regard it as a special experience for summary and promotion," after the facts repeatedly proved that this was a successful experience, he strived to promote it universally throughout the district and wanted to create and summarize a more complete set of experiences in leading mutual aid and cooperation. This attitude towards advanced experience is very necessary, and it is the attitude that every Party member and every Party organization should adopt towards advanced experience.
    The second situation is not valuing, not learning, and not promoting the advanced experience of the leadership mutual aid and cooperation movement. There are some responsible cadres and Party members who complain about "few cadres, a lot of work, and unfinished tasks"; or say: "Lack of experience, no way to lead," and adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards the mutual aid and cooperation movement; they do not learn from the masses, do not summarize advanced leadership experience, and are even less good at organically combining learning advanced leadership experience from other places with summarizing advanced leadership experience locally. These people have conservative and narrow empiricist thinking, and lack the noble quality of a Communist Party member—a sense of new things. They do not believe in advanced work experience, and they dare not create advanced work experience. They stubbornly cling to the old set of work methods and are satisfied with this, not seeking progress.
    In order to promote advanced experiences, Party organizations in various localities must first fight against conservative and narrow empiricist thinking, carry out criticism and self-criticism within the rural Party organizations, launch criticism of backward thinking and criticism of conservative thinking, and clear obstacles on the road to advanced work experience. Only in this way can we replace the backward and conservative empiricist leadership methods with scientific leadership methods and continue to promote the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    党组织要注意推广领导互助合作运动的先进经验
    随着农村互助合作运动的发展，若干地区党的组织在领导互助合作运动中已创造了不少先进的领导经验。各地党组织都有责任以一切力量来支持和推广这些先进的领导经验，把互助合作运动推向前进。
    从若干材料来看，在推广先进经验上有两种情况：第一种对先进经验是重视的，或是比较重视的，并善于学习和推广。山西长治县南和村的支部书记刘福林、中共长治三区区委书记冯士端就属于这种类型。当王定祥提出建立“互助组长接头会”时，刘福林就给以支持，这种办法终于试行成功，使南和村的互助合作运动走向高潮。冯士端虽然在开始时把王定祥的“互助组长接头会”当成了“一般的工作方法”，认为“用不着当作一个专门经验，再去总结推广了”，但在事实一再证明这是一个成功的经验后，他就努力在全区普遍加以推广，并要创造总结出一套更完整的领导互助合作的经验。这种对先进经验的态度是十分必要的，这是每个党员，每个党的组织对先进经验所应该采取的态度。
    第二种情况，就是不重视不学习和不推广领导互助合作运动的先进经验。有这样的一些负责的干部党员，他们抱怨着“干部少，工作多，任务完不成”；或说：“缺少经验，没法领导”，对互助合作运动采取放任自流的态度；他们不向群众学习，不总结先进的领导经验，更不善于把学习外地的先进领导经验，和总结本地的先进领导经验有机地结合起来。这些人有着保守的狭隘的经验主义的思想，而缺少共产党员的高贵品质——对新鲜事物的感觉。他们不相信先进的工作经验，又不敢创造先进工作经验，死抱着老一套的工作方法，并以此为满足，不求前进。
    为了推广先进经验，各地党组织首先要和保守的狭隘的经验主义思想作斗争，要在农村党的组织内，开展批评和自我批评，展开对落后思想的批评，对保守思想的批评，给先进工作经验清除前进路上的障碍。只有这样，才能以科学的领导方法，代替落后的保守的经验主义的领导方法，继续推动互助合作运动向前发展。
