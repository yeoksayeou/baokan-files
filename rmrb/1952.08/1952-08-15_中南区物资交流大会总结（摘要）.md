Summary of the Central South Region Materials Exchange Conference (Abstract)
	Niu Peicong

	The Central South Region Materials Exchange Conference, after half a month (from July 14th to 31st), has yielded great results.

	Firstly, the ideological understanding of the representatives from both public and private sectors from various regions participating in this conference, as well as all the staff members, has been greatly enhanced. The representatives of state-owned trading companies and cooperatives have further clarified the boundaries between the New Democratic and capitalist management styles, criticizing the purely profit-driven view, the purely business-driven view, and the capitalist tendency of disregarding planning. The private industrialists and merchants have also made improvements in their management perspectives and styles compared to before the "Five-Anti" campaign. The conference staff also demonstrated a high sense of responsibility, and work efficiency was significantly improved. These are all achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. This materials exchange conference has further consolidated these achievements.

	Secondly, the representatives from state-owned enterprises participating in the large and small exchange activities during the conference better demonstrated the leading role of the state-owned economy and the policy of division of labor and cooperation among various economic components under the leadership of the state-owned economy, where each plays its due role. Private industrialists and merchants received education and assistance from the state-owned economy in their business operations, dispelled some unnecessary concerns, and dared to engage in business with confidence. They realized that only under the leadership of the national plan, the state-owned economy, and the working class can they correctly conduct their own operations. This has greatly strengthened the relationship between the state-owned and private economies, laying a good foundation for future urban-rural exchanges.

	Thirdly, the economic gains of this conference are significant: (A) The conference organized large-scale exchanges of materials within and outside the region, small-scale short-distance exchanges between delegations within the province, and internal and external exchanges. Consequently, the total value of native products traded at the conference reached 147.59 billion yuan, of which slow-moving native products accounted for 33.28% of the total value of native product transactions. Native products such as live pigs, cane sugar, beans, grains, native cloth, fruits, gallnuts, porcelain, native tobacco leaves, sulfur, medicinal materials, and raw lacquer have basically or partially opened up sales channels. The bamboo and rattan industry in Wuhan had 700 million yuan of capital and its products were all stockpiled. The conference sold more than 200 million yuan of inventory, enabling the industry to continue production for another half year. The miscellaneous wood from Wuhan and Huangchuan, which had not found sales channels for three or four years, not only sold out all its inventory at this conference but also supplied hundreds of workers in the miscellaneous wood industry in Shanghai with enough raw materials to maintain production until the end of March next year. Local indigo from Xishui, Hubei, and rock crystal from Yunyang also opened up sales channels. (B) The total value of industrial product transactions was more than 84.72 billion yuan. Due to the large-scale purchase and sale by state-owned trading organizations, cooperatives, and private representatives in small and medium-sized cities, industrial products have gradually flowed from large cities to primary markets and vast rural areas. For example, the transaction volume of cloth, kerosene, cotton gins, socks, and wrought iron for manufacturing agricultural implements was very large. (C) Through the efforts of the conference and relevant departments and import and export industries, the transaction of import and export materials has gradually become active. Many abundant native products in China, such as live pigs, gallnuts, waste silk, rosin, melon seeds, tobacco leaves, and raw lacquer, have a certain amount of exports. Imported materials such as Western medicine, rapid dyes, and industrial equipment have also been purchased, solving the needs of the domestic market.

	In general, the purchase and sale of native products or industrial products, or the operation of import and export trade materials, are all carried out around the original purchase and sale plan. Through the conference, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives have adjusted their quarterly plans and made it possible for the formulation of future purchase and sale plans to be closer to the actual situation of market supply and demand. Private industrialists and merchants have also realized certain purchase and sale plans.

	The total transaction volume of this conference, including native products and industrial products, reached 232.32 billion yuan (the total purchase and sale volume reached 464.64 billion yuan). Native products accounted for 63.53%, and industrial products accounted for 36.47%. Transactions within the region accounted for 84.72% of the total transaction volume, and transactions outside the region accounted for 15.28%. In this exchange, the proportion of various economic components was as follows: In terms of procurement, state-owned enterprises accounted for 54%, cooperatives accounted for 7.4%, public-private joint ventures accounted for 1%, and private enterprises accounted for 37.6%. In terms of sales, state-owned enterprises accounted for 67%, cooperatives accounted for 10.2%, public-private joint ventures accounted for 1.4%, and private enterprises accounted for 21.4%. The transaction proportion of the private economy at this conference was not very large because many large industries and large enterprises did not submit their purchase and sale plans to the conference. The plans of many industry representatives were not the plans of the entire industry, or even the entire plan of their own business. This made their purchase and sale business appear smaller in the transaction proportion, which was not commensurate with their actual proportion in the general market.

	This conference also had many shortcomings: Firstly, the scale of the transaction for this conference was underestimated before the conference, so the preparation was not thorough and proactive, which increased some avoidable difficulties for representatives from various regions. Secondly, because the publicity and mobilization work of the conference was not extensive and in-depth enough, individual private enterprise representatives did not fully understand the significance of the "Five-Anti" campaign and still did not honestly engage in legitimate business. This must be corrected in the future. Thirdly, there were also many shortcomings in the organizational work of the conference, mainly the complicated transaction procedures and excessive levels. In addition, some staff members were unfamiliar with the business, which also increased the inconvenience of transactions.

	Based on the experience of this conference, to successfully hold such a conference, the following three key links should be grasped.

	(1) Participating units must make good purchase and sale plans in advance. Whether state-owned trading organizations, cooperatives, or private enterprises, they must all, without exception, formulate these plans based on the objective and subjective conditions such as the country's economic development, the needs of the people, and their own capital and operating capabilities. The plan must strive to be close to reality, opposing exaggeration and conservatism. The purchase and sale plans of various economic components should be adjusted and coordinated with each other under the auspices of the local industrial and commercial administrative departments and the state-owned economy to avoid duplication, waste, and price gouging.

	(2) The transaction must implement the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, both large and small interests, regional mutual assistance, and urban-rural mutual assistance. It is necessary to adhere to the business style of mutual assistance and mutual concession, mutual support, and mutual responsibility, and oppose the erroneous views and styles of purely profiting, harming others for one's own benefit, and being solely driven by profit. During the conference, good examples should be commended to drive the general, and representatives who do not comply with the transaction policies of the conference should also be given appropriate criticism and treatment to establish new business ethics and new business styles.

	In order to ensure the successful progress of the conference, a series of organizational work needs to be adopted, such as professional seminars, regional meetings, small-scale exchange meetings for provincial delegations, barter meetings for popular goods combined with slow-moving goods, and slow-moving goods exchanged for slow-moving goods, allocation meetings for certain fast-selling goods, contract review meetings, price evaluation meetings, and loan review meetings. In the control of price policies, transactions of bulk commodities and commodities closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood must be carried out in accordance with state-owned prices. For some sporadic products or commodities that are not directly controlled by state-owned trade and for which the conference has not stipulated formal prices, the buyer and seller are allowed to agree on the transaction, but under the principle of taking into account the interests of production, transportation, and sales, the price should still be appropriately adjusted by the conference when necessary.

	(3) Although this Central South Region Materials Exchange Conference strived to do as much cash and spot transactions as possible, it did not relax the conclusion of short-term futures contracts. Cash and spot transactions accounted for 38% of this conference, and term payments and futures accounted for 62%. Therefore, how to ensure the faithful performance of contracts after the conclusion of futures contracts, eliminate the fraudulent practices of the old society, and overcome the supply system viewpoint of state-owned trade and cooperative cadres has become a very important issue for consolidating the victorious achievements of the conference. In order to ensure that the contract can be performed, in addition to the buyer and seller having a serious and responsible attitude towards the contract, there must also be administrative supervision. The specific method is that all purchase and sale contracts signed by state-owned trade and cooperatives should be included in the business plan for the next quarter without exception, so that the execution of the contract is combined with the completion of the business plan. Those who do not comply with the contract, tear up the contract, delay delivery, delay payment, use inferior goods to replace good goods, use fewer goods to replace more goods, or make excuses to deny their debts, in addition to compensating the other party for losses, must also be subject to legal sanctions. In terms of organizational implementation, in addition to the establishment of a contract execution inspection and handling committee at the central and southern levels, all provinces and cities need to form an inspection and execution agency of the same nature under the leadership of the Finance Committee and the People's Supervisory Committee.

	The end of the materials exchange conference does not mean the end of the materials exchange work. After the conference, there is still a series of work to be done. The leading agencies in various regions should continue to strengthen the leadership of the materials exchange work from the ideological, political, and specific organizational work aspects.

    中南区物资交流大会总结（摘要）
    牛佩琮
    中南区物资交流大会，经过半个月（七月十四日起，三十一日止）的时间，收获是很大的。
    首先，参加这次大会的各地公私营代表和大会全体工作人员，在思想上大大提高了一步。国营贸易和合作社的代表们，进一步划清了新民主主义和资本主义经营作风的界限，批判了单纯利润观点、单纯业务观点和不重视计划的资本主义倾向。私营工商业代表，在经营观点和作风上，较“五反”前也有所改进。大会工作人员也表现了高度的责任心，工作效率显著提高。这些都是“三反”“五反”的成果。经过这次物资交流大会，更使这些成果巩固起来。
    其次，国营企业到会代表们参加了大会中大大小小的交流业务，更好地表现了国营经济的领导作用及在国营经济领导下各种经济成分的分工合作各得其所的政策。私营工商业者在业务经营中，得到了国营经济的教育和帮助，解除了若干不必要的顾虑，敢于放手经营。他们体会到只有在国家计划、国营经济和工人阶级的领导下，才能正确地进行自己的经营。这就大大加强了国营和私营经济之间的关系，为今后城乡交流打下良好的基础。
    第三，这次大会在经济上的收获是很大的：（甲）大会组织了区内外物资的大宗交流，省内各地代表团的小宗短距离交流和内外交流，因而大会中土产成交总值达一四、七五九亿多元，其中滞销土产占土产交易总值百分之三三·二八，内生猪、土糖、豆类、杂粮、土布、水果、五棓子、瓷器、土烟叶、硫磺、药材、生漆等，基本上或部分地打开了销路。武汉竹藤业企业资金七亿元，产品全部积压，大会中卖出了两亿余元的存货，使该业能以继续维持半年生产。武汉和潢川的杂木，三、四年找不到销路，这次大会上不但存货全部销出，还供应了上海杂木业数百工人以足够维持到明年三月底的生产原料。湖北浠水的土靛，郧阳的水晶石等产品也都打开了销路。（乙）工业品成交共八、四七二亿多元，由于中小城市国营贸易机关、合作社和私营代表的大量购销，工业品由大城市已逐渐流向初级市场和广大农村中去，如布匹、煤油、轧花机、袜子、制造农具用的熟铁等，成交数量都很大。（丙）经过大会和有关部门及进出口业的努力，进出口物资的交易也逐渐趋向活跃，国内许多富裕的土产，如生猪、五棓子、废丝、松香、瓜子、烟叶、生漆等，都有一定数量的输出；进口物资如西药、快靛、工业器材等，也有购入，解决了国内市场的需求。
    总的说来，不论土产或工业品的购销，或是进出口贸易物资的经营，都是环绕着原订购销计划进行的。国营贸易和合作社，通过大会，调整了自己的季度计划，并使今后购销计划的制订，有可能更接近市场供求的实际情况；私营工商业者，也实现了某些购销计划。
    这次大会交易总额包括土产和工业品共达二三、二三二亿元（购销合计总额达四六、四六四亿元）；土产占百分之六三·五三，工业品占百分之三六·四七；区内交易占交易总额百分之八四·七二，区外占百分之一五·二八。在这次交流中，各种经济成分所占比重：收购方面国营企业占百分之五四，合作社占百分之七·四，公私合营占百分之一，私营企业占百分之三七·六；推销方面国营占百分之六七，合作社占百分之一○·二，公私合营占百分之一·四，私营占百分之二一·四。这次大会私营经济成交比重不算很大，原因是许多大行业和大户并没有向大会提出他们的购销计划，许多行业代表的计划，还不是整个行业的计划，甚或还不是代表本商号的全部计划，这就使得他们的购销业务表现在交易比重上较少了一些，与他们在一般市场所占实际比重不相称。
    这次大会也有许多缺点：首先是会前对这次会议的交易规模估计不足，因而在准备上表现得不周密、不主动，增加了各地代表一些可以避免的困难。其次，由于大会的宣传动员工作不够广泛深入，个别私营企业代表对“五反”意义认识不够，仍不老老实实进行正当经营，这是今后必须努力改正的。第三，在大会的组织工作上，也有许多缺点，主要是交易手续繁杂，层次过多，加以某些工作人员业务生疏，也增加了交易上的不便。
    根据这次大会的体会，要开好这种会议，应掌握以下三个环节。
    （一）参加单位必须事先作好购销计划，不论国营贸易机关、合作社或私营企业，均须无例外地根据国家经济的发展和人民需要及本身资金和经营能力等主客观条件订定这些计划。计划必须力求接近实际，反对夸大，也反对保守。各种经济成分的购销计划，应在当地工商行政部门和国营经济的主持下，进行相互间的调整配合，避免重复浪费和抬价抢购等现象。
    （二）进行交易必须贯彻公私兼顾、大小兼顾、地区互助、城乡互助的方针，坚持互助互让、相互支持、相互负责的经营作风，反对单纯营利、损人利己、惟利是图的错误观点和作风。在大会期间，应对好的典型，加以表扬，带动一般；对个别不遵守大会交易方针的代表，也需要进行适当的批评和处理，以树立新的商业道德和新的经营作风。
    为了保证大会胜利进行，还需要采取一系列的组织工作，如专业座谈会、地区碰头会、省内代表团小型交流会，热货搭冷货、冷货换冷货的易货会议，某些畅销货的分配会议，合同审查会议，价格评审会议，贷款审核会议等。在价格政策的掌握上，大宗商品与国计民生关系密切的商品，必须按照国营牌价进行交易；某些零星产品或国营贸易不直接掌握的商品，而大会又未规定正式牌价者，允许买卖双方协议成交，但在兼顾产运销三者利益的原则下，必要时其价格仍应由大会适当予以调整。
    （三）这次中南区物资交流大会虽争取尽可能多做现款现货交易，但亦不放松短期期货的成交。此次大会现款现货成交占百分之三八，期款期货占百分之六二，因此在期货成交后，如何保证忠实履行合同，扫清旧社会欺诈作风，克服国营贸易与合作社干部的供给制观点，就成为巩固大会胜利成果的很重要的问题。为了使合同能以履行，除买卖双方对合同应有严肃负责态度外，还必须有行政上的监督，其具体办法是：凡国营贸易和合作社签订的购销合同应无例外的订入下一季度的业务计划中，使执行合同与完成业务计划相结合。凡不遵守合同，撕毁合同，迟不交货，迟不付款，以坏顶好，以少顶多，借故抵赖者，除应补偿对方损失外，还必须受到法律的制裁。在组织执行上，除中南一级成立合同执行检查处理委员会外，各省市均需要在财委与人民监察委员会领导下，组成同样性质的检查执行机构。
    物资交流大会的结束，不等于物资交流工作的结束，会后，还有一系列的工作要做，各地区的领导机关，应当继续从思想上、政治上、具体组织工作各方面加强对物资交流工作的领导。
