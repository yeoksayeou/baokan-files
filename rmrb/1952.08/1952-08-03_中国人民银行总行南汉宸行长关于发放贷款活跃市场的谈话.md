    To understand the current situation of the national financial institutions in supporting private industry and commerce, revitalizing the market, and developing production, the reporter interviewed President Nan Hanchen of the People's Bank of China, who kindly shared the following remarks:
    The People's Bank of China has consistently implemented the established policies of the Central People's Government of taking into consideration both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, developing production, and promoting economic prosperity. It encourages the business enthusiasm of private economic enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and supports their development. Over the past three years, the People's Bank of China has established extensive connections with private industry and commerce, creating favorable conditions for their development through measures such as stabilizing currency, lowering interest rates, issuing loans, conducting remittances, and acting as a clearing agent.
    After the great victories of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, a period of even greater economic prosperity for the nation is about to arrive. Private industry and commerce, after eliminating the "five evils," are about to achieve unprecedented prosperity and development. In order to encourage private industry and commerce to fully exert their business enthusiasm, rapidly invigorate the market, and develop production, the People's Bank of China has decided to increase loans to private industry and commerce, and at the same time lower lending rates.
    The increase in loans to private industry and commerce has been implemented since May. To date, the total amount of loans has reached over 3 trillion yuan, an increase of twofold compared to before. For example, Beijing has issued over 80 billion yuan (supporting over 9,000 industrial and commercial households), Tianjin has issued over 200 billion yuan (supporting over 12,000 industrial and commercial households), Shanghai has issued 700 billion yuan, Wuhan has issued over 100 billion yuan, and Chongqing has issued over 100 billion yuan. The targets of the loans include industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. We adopt a supportive attitude towards large, medium, and small industrial and commercial enterprises. We support large industrial and commercial enterprises that have a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood, and we also issue small loans to medium and small industrial and commercial enterprises that have a certain role to play. We attach importance to large cities, and we do not neglect small and medium-sized cities. The role of bank loans is to encourage private industry and commerce to operate actively in order to meet the arrival of a period of greater economic prosperity for the nation.
    The reduction of bank lending rates by 30% to 50% has been implemented since June 25. The purpose is to reduce the operating costs of industry and commerce, ensure reasonable profits for industry and commerce, and encourage the development of industry and commerce. Lending rates are set lower for industrial loans, creating more favorable conditions for the development of industrial production. Industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai believe that increased processing fees, increased loans, and lowered interest rates are three favorable factors for the development of industry and commerce.
    Private industry and commerce have expressed a warm welcome to the measures of increasing loans and lowering interest rates by the bank. Many industrial and commercial enterprises have quickly resumed operations and developed production due to obtaining loans. Due to the government's adoption of measures such as processing, ordering, purchasing, and lending to encourage the development of industry and commerce, industrial production in Shanghai and other places has begun to reach the peak levels of last December, the prosperity of industry and commerce in wheat-harvesting areas has begun to arrive, and the exchange of goods throughout the country is gradually approaching a climax. The People's Bank of China is not only willing to support industry and commerce at present to revitalize the market and develop production, but also prepares to establish extensive and close financial relationships with industry and commerce in the future period of economic construction to support the development of private industry and commerce.

    中国人民银行总行南汉宸行长关于发放贷款活跃市场的谈话
    记者为了解国家金融机关当前扶助私营工商业，活跃市场，发展生产工作的情况，特访问中国人民银行总行南汉宸行长，承发表谈话如下：
    中国人民银行一贯执行中央人民政府的公私兼顾、劳资两利、发展生产、繁荣经济的既定政策，对于有利于国计民生的私营经济事业，鼓励其经营的积极性，并扶助其发展。近三年来，中国人民银行已经与私营工商业建立了广泛的联系，从稳定通货、降低利率、发放贷款、开展汇兑、代理清算等措施，为工商业的发展造成有利条件。
    在伟大的“三反”“五反”运动获得胜利以后，国家经济更大的繁荣时期即将到来。私营工商业于消除五毒后，即将获得前所未有的繁荣与发展。中国人民银行为鼓励私营工商业充分发挥其经营的积极性，迅速活跃市场，发展生产，已决定增加对私营工商业的贷款，同时降低放款利率。
    增加对私营工商业的放款，已自五月份起执行。至目前为止，放款总额已达三万余亿，较前增加二倍。例如北京已放出八百余亿（扶助工商业九千余户），天津已放出二千余亿（扶助工商业一万二千户），上海放出七千余亿，武汉放出一千余亿，重庆放出一千余亿。放款的对象包括对于国计民生有利的工业和商业。对于大、中、小工商业我们均采取扶助的态度，大的对于国计民生有重大作用的工商业我们加以扶助，中、小的具有一定作用的工商业我们也发放小额贷款。对于大城市我们重视，对于中小城市我们也不忽视。银行贷款的作用，是鼓励私营工商业积极经营，以迎接国家经济更大繁荣时期的到来。
    银行放款利率降低百分之三十至五十，已于六月二十五日实行。其目的在于降低工商业的经营成本，保证工商业的合理利润。鼓励工商业的发展。放款利率对于工业放款规定较低，为工业生产的发展造成更加有利的条件。上海工商业家认为工缴提高、放款增加、利率降低，是工商业发展的三个有利因素。
    私营工商业对银行增加放款及降低利率的措施，表现热烈欢迎。许多工商业由于获得贷款，已经迅速恢复经营，发展生产。由于政府采取加工、订货、收购、贷款等项措施，鼓励工商业发展，目前上海等地工业生产已开始达到去年十二月旺季的水平，麦收地区工商业繁荣已开始到来，全国物资交流正逐步接近高潮。中国人民银行不仅愿意在当前扶助工商业，以活跃市场、发展生产；而且准备在今后经济建设时期，与工商业建立广泛而密切的资金往来关系，以扶助私营工商业的发展。
