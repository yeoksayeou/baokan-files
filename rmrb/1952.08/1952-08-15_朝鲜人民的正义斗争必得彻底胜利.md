    The 15th of August marks the seventh anniversary of the liberation of the Korean people. Seven years ago, the Soviet army defeated the Japanese imperialist aggression against Asia and liberated the Korean people from the enslavement of Japanese fascism. The Korean people, who had suffered colonial oppression for half a century, gained freedom and independence. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and General Kim Il-sung, they rebuilt their homeland and built a peaceful and happy life. However, this peaceful and happy life of the Korean people was destroyed in its fifth year by the American aggressors. The American aggressors attempted to deprive the Korean people of their national independence, prevent Korea from becoming a democratic, unified, free, and happy country, and attempted to establish a puppet regime of the Syngman Rhee gang in all of Korea by force, in order to turn all of Korea into its colony and base of aggression.

    The heroic Korean people, inheriting and carrying forward the glorious tradition of past struggles against Japanese imperialism, launched a heroic and just war against the American aggressors. The Korean War, which has lasted for more than two years, proves that the American aggressors' aggressive plan to enslave the Korean people has met with a shameful failure. In the Korean War, the American aggressors gathered the forces of seventeen vassal states, mobilized the elite main force of their own army, navy, and air force, and also used inhuman bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and napalm bombs, but still could not avoid defeat. The Korean people, who have already gained independence and liberation, absolutely cannot tolerate any aggressor throwing them back into a state of enslavement. The Korean people have fresh memories of the oppression and suffering they have endured for half a century, and they extremely hate the American aggressors. The struggle of the Korean people proves that when an awakened, freedom-loving nation rises to fight for the glory and independence of the motherland, any ferocious and barbaric enemy will inevitably fail before them.

    Precisely because the war waged by the Korean people is a just war against American aggression, it has received the sympathy of all countries in the peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and the full support of all peace-loving people in the world. In particular, the appearance of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield completely changed the situation of the Korean War. Now, the Korean and Chinese people have united into a powerful and invincible force in the struggle against the American aggressors and have achieved a decisive victory. These victories are mainly manifested in four aspects: First, the American aggressors were driven back from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, the starting point of their aggression, and the enemy was greatly depleted, making it impossible for them to advance further north. From the time the Chinese People's Volunteers participated in the war on October 25, 1950, to June 15 of this year, more than 547,000 enemy troops have been annihilated on the Korean battlefield, of which more than 230,000 were American aggressor troops. In the second year of the Korean War alone, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces shot down and damaged more than 5,900 enemy aircraft. The United States has already used 1.5 million troops in the Korean War, and now it has to forcibly conscript American youths under the age of service in its own country. The US financial budget is even more stretched, with a deficit of 16 percent. With the prolongation of the war of aggression against Korea, the various insurmountable fundamental difficulties of the American aggressors will inevitably become more serious. Second, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces have become stronger and stronger in the war, enriching their experience in modern warfare. The Korean and Chinese People's Forces have shown great courage in the war, overcome various difficulties, continuously improved and improved their combat skills, learned offensive warfare, defensive warfare, and mountain warfare, and can effectively organize the coordinated operations of various weapons and services in any combat situation. The equipment of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces has been improved, and they have increasingly powerful air force and artillery units, and have begun to inflict heavy blows on the enemy in the sky and on the ground. Third, the level of awareness of the Korean and Chinese people has been greatly improved in the just struggle against the common enemy. The people of the two countries have highly promoted patriotism and internationalism, and have formed an unbreakable fighting friendship. In the great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the Chinese people have worked hard to increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and have achieved brilliant victories. In the movement to donate weapons, the Chinese people donated more than 3,700 aircraft alone. With the support of 475 million Chinese people and the vast Korean people, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces will always stand invincible. Fourth, the victorious struggle of the Korean and Chinese people has disrupted the American aggressors' plan to prepare and launch a third world war. At present, the Korean front is only more than 400 miles long, but it has attracted the main force of the American army, and continues to consume a large amount of American manpower, material resources, and financial resources, making the American aggressors embarrassed in all aspects. This proves that the United States, which boasts of being the "world's number one power," is completely a paper tiger that looks strong but is actually weak. If it were to follow its dream of launching a third world war, encircling the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, and launching wars on a front of no less than six or seven thousand miles from Germany to Korea, it would only break its head and bleed, and fail even more miserably.

    The great victory of the Korean and Chinese people has forced the American aggressors to sit down and conduct armistice negotiations. Now, an agreement has been reached on the entire draft armistice agreement, but the United States has refused to repatriate prisoners of war in accordance with Articles 51 and 52 of the draft agreement. The purpose of doing so contains a clear conspiracy, that is, to forcibly detain our captured personnel and send them to the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee gang as cannon fodder for aggression, and to use this to undermine the armistice negotiations and expand the war of aggression. The American aggressors' so-called "honorable armistice" of forcibly detaining our captured personnel is to leave an "ugly precedent" in the Korean armistice that is convenient for it to continue its aggression, and to carry out deceptive propaganda to the world in order to make up for the failures it has suffered on the battlefield, and to try to save its reputation in the war of aggression against Korea. However, it can be determined that what the American aggressors cannot get on the battlefield cannot be obtained at the negotiating table by bluffing and playing rogue tricks.

    Now, the American aggressors still ignore the peace aspirations of the people of the world and refuse to abandon their conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel. On the one hand, it is arrogantly continuing to adopt the method of unreasonable adjournment to escape the just accusations of the people of the world; on the other hand, it is frantically carrying out the so-called "military pressure" to intimidate, vainly attempting to force us to accept its absurd demands. However, the American aggressors' so-called "military pressure" has repeatedly gone bankrupt, and even they themselves know that this so-called "military pressure" can never shake our firm stance. Any "military pressure" from the United States can only explain its brutality and barbarism, its deliberate undermining of the armistice negotiations, and its expansion of the Korean War, and cannot be interpreted in any other way. The recent series of indiscriminate bombings by the American aggressors against peaceful residents of Korea are even more crimes that completely violate the Geneva Convention. For example, the barbarous bombings of the Pyongyang area by American aircraft on July 11, August 4, and August 10 were all aimed at residential areas of peaceful residents, and the vast majority of the victims were women and children. On the 5th of this month, the headquarters of the Fifth Air Force of the invading US army even clamored to carry out barbarous bombings of 78 peaceful cities in northern Korea. This heinous and barbaric act of the American aggressors immediately aroused the anger of the people all over the world. We, the Chinese people, must also seriously protest against the crimes of the United States in massacring peaceful residents of Korea. American Air Force Secretary Finletter and Far East Air Force Commander Weyland and others are trying to describe these crimes of massacring civilians, destroying peaceful cities, and violating the Geneva Convention as "destroying military targets" in an attempt to deceive the people of the world and escape the just condemnation of the people of all countries. However, the facts prove that this lie of the American aggressors cannot deceive anyone. Even the British "Reno News" expressed dissatisfaction with this lie of the American aggressors, saying: "No one would think that these cities that will be massively destroyed are important military targets." It can be seen that this bloody crime of the American aggressors will only make them more isolated, and the people of the world will further recognize that they are the enemies of all mankind. The despicable attempt of the American aggressors to force the Korean and Chinese people to accept their absurd demands by escaping from the meeting and indiscriminately bombing will never succeed. The Korean and Chinese people sincerely hope to achieve peace in Korea, but if the American aggressors want to undermine the negotiations and expand the war, the Korean and Chinese people will certainly have the strength to smash all new offensives of the enemy.

    On this seventh anniversary of the liberation of the great Korean people from the shackles of the Japanese aggressors, the Chinese people deeply respect and sympathize with the spirit of the Korean people in bravely resisting the American aggressors. The Chinese people deeply know that the Chinese and Korean people are as close as lips and teeth, and the American aggressors' aggression against Korea is inseparable from their policy of aggression against China. Therefore, the Chinese people must not only aid the Korean people, but also support the just struggle of the Korean people with all their strength in order to defend their homes and defend their country, so that Korea can achieve peace and security. Chairman Mao Zedong said in a telegram congratulating the seventh anniversary of the liberation of Korea: "In order to resist the common enemy, for the peace of Korea and the security of China, the Chinese people will always stand firmly with the Korean people and fight for the complete victory over the American imperialist aggressors." This represents the common will of the entire Chinese people. We firmly believe that the great strength of the close unity between the Chinese and Korean people will surely defeat any conspiracy of the American aggressors, and the just struggle of the Korean people will inevitably achieve final and eternal victory on the basis of the victories already achieved.

### 朝鲜人民的正义斗争必得彻底胜利

    朝鲜人民的正义斗争必得彻底胜利
    八月十五日是朝鲜人民解放七周年纪念日。七年前，苏联军队击败了日本帝国主义对亚洲的侵略，把朝鲜人民从日本法西斯的奴役下解放出来。半世纪以来备受殖民地压迫痛苦的朝鲜人民，从此获得了自由和独立，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成将军的领导下，重建起自己的家园，建设着和平幸福的生活。但是，朝鲜人民这种和平幸福的生活，在第五年就被美国侵略者破坏了。美国侵略者企图剥夺朝鲜人民已得到的民族独立，阻止朝鲜成为一个民主统一、自由幸福的国家，它企图在全朝鲜用暴力建立李承晚匪帮的傀儡政权，以便把朝鲜全部变成它的殖民地和侵略基地。
    英雄的朝鲜军民，承继与发扬了过去与日本帝国主义斗争的光荣传统，对美国侵略者展开了英勇的正义战争。两年多以来的朝鲜战争证明，美国侵略者奴役朝鲜人民的侵略计划，已经遭到了可耻的失败。美国侵略者在侵朝战争中，纠集了十七个仆从国家的兵力，动员它自己陆、海、空军的精锐主力，还使用了灭绝人性的细菌武器、化学武器和凝固汽油弹，但是仍然不免于失败。已经获得了独立解放的朝鲜人民，绝对不能容忍任何侵略者再把他们投到被奴役的境地里去。朝鲜人民对于半世纪以来所受的压迫和痛苦，是记忆犹新的，他们极端痛恨美国侵略者。朝鲜人民的斗争证明，一个觉醒了的爱好自由的民族，当它为了祖国的光荣和独立而奋起战斗的时候，任何凶恶野蛮的敌人，都必然要在他们的面前失败下去。
    正由于朝鲜人民所进行的战争，是反抗美国侵略的正义战争，它就因此得到以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国的同情和世界一切爱好和平人民的全力支持。尤其是我国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上的出现，就完全改变了朝鲜战争的形势。现在，朝中人民在反对美国侵略者的斗争中，已经团结成为强大的不可战胜的力量，并取得了决定性的胜利。这些胜利主要的表现在四个方面：第一，把美国侵略者从鸭绿江边，打回到它发动侵略的出发地点——三八线附近，大量消耗了敌人，使其无法北进一步。自我国人民志愿军一九五零年十月二十五日参加作战至今年六月十五日止，敌人在朝鲜战场上已被歼灭了五十四万七千多名，其中美国侵略军占二十三万多名。仅在朝鲜战争的第二年，朝中人民部队就击落与击伤了敌军飞机五千九百多架。美国在朝鲜战争中，已经动用兵力一百五十万，现在又不得不在它国内强征不足役龄的美国青年入伍了。美国的财政预算则更加捉襟见肘，出现了百分之十六的赤字。随着侵朝战争的延长，美国侵略者各种不可克服的根本困难，必将更加严重起来。第二，朝中人民部队愈战愈强，丰富了进行现代战争的经验。朝中人民部队在战争中表现了极大的勇敢，克服了各种困难，不断地改进和提高了战斗技术，学会了进攻战、防御战和山岳战，并且能够在任何战斗情况下，有效地组织各种武器和各兵种的协同作战。朝中人民部队的装备已得到改善，已经拥有日益强大的空军和炮兵部队，开始在天空和地面给敌人以沉重打击。第三，朝中人民在反对共同敌人的正义斗争中，觉悟程度大大提高了。两国人民高度发扬了爱国主义和国际主义精神，结成了牢不可破的战斗友谊。中国人民在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，努力增加生产，厉行节约，以支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，取得了辉煌的胜利。中国人民在捐献武器运动中，仅飞机一项就捐献了三千七百多架。朝中人民部队有着四亿七千五百万中国人民和广大朝鲜人民的支持，就会永远立于必胜不败之地。第四，朝中人民的胜利斗争，打乱了美国侵略者准备和发动第三次世界大战计划，目前朝鲜战线不过四百多里，便吸住了美国的军队主力，并大量地继续消耗着美国的人力、物力和财力，使美国侵略者在各方面窘态毕露。这证明了自吹为“世界头号强国”的美国，完全是一个外强中干的纸老虎。如果依照它发动第三次世界大战的梦想，要包围苏联、中国和各人民民主国家，在从德国到朝鲜不下六七万里的战线上发动战争，那就只会使它碰得头破血流，失败得更加悲惨。
    朝中人民的伟大胜利，迫使美国侵略者不得不坐下来进行停战谈判。现在，全部停战协定草案已经取得协议，但是美国却拒绝按照协定草案第五十一和第五十二款来遣返战俘。它这样做的目的，包含着显明的阴谋，就是企图强迫扣留我方被俘人员，送给台湾国民党残匪和李承晚匪帮充当侵略的炮灰，并借此破坏停战谈判，扩大侵略战争。美国侵略者强迫扣留我方被俘人员的所谓“光荣的停战”，就是想在朝鲜停战中留下便于它继续侵略的“丑恶的先例”，向世人进行欺骗宣传，以弥补它在战场上所已经遭到的失败，企图挽救它在侵朝战争中弄得声名狼籍的处境。可是，美国侵略者在战场上得不到的东西，在谈判桌上用虚张声势、耍流氓手段，也同样不能得到，这是可以断定的。
    现在，美国侵略者依然不顾世界人民的和平愿望，不肯放弃它强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋。它正一面蛮横地继续采取无理休会的办法，逃避世界人民的正义指责；一面疯狂进行所谓“军事压力”的恫吓，妄图迫使我方接受其荒谬主张。可是，美国侵略者的所谓“军事压力”已经一再破产，甚至它自己也深知这种所谓“军事压力”，绝不能动摇我方的坚定立场。美国的任何“军事压力”，除了说明它的残暴野蛮、蓄意破坏停战谈判和扩大朝鲜战争以外，是不能作任何其他解释的。美国侵略者最近对着朝鲜和平居民所进行的一连串的狂轰滥炸，更是彻底违反日内瓦公约的罪行。例如美机在七月十一日、八月四日和八月十日几次对平壤地区的野蛮轰炸，其目标都是和平居民的住宅区，牺牲者绝大多数是妇女和儿童。本月五日，侵朝美军第五航空队司令部竟又扬言，要对朝鲜北部七十八个和平城市进行野蛮轰炸。美国侵略者这种穷凶极恶的野蛮行为，立即激起了全世界人民的愤怒。我们中国人民更要严重抗议美国屠杀朝鲜和平居民的罪行。美国空军部长芬立脱和远东空军司令威兰之流，力图把这些屠杀平民、破坏和平城市、违反日内瓦公约的罪恶行为，说成是“摧毁军事目标”，想借此蒙蔽世界人民，逃脱各国人民的正义的谴责。但是，事实证明美国侵略者的这种谎言，欺骗不了任何人。甚至英国的“雷诺新闻”对美国侵略者这种谎言也表示不满说：“没有人会认为这些将被大规模毁灭的城市，是重要的军事目标”。可见美国侵略者这种血腥罪行，只有使它自己更加陷于孤立，世界人民将进一步认清它是全人类的敌人。美国侵略者想用逃会和狂轰滥炸来迫使朝中人民接受其荒谬主张的卑鄙企图，是永远不会成功的。朝中人民真诚地希望在朝鲜获致和平，但是，如果美国侵略者要破坏谈判，扩大战争，朝中人民也一定有力量粉碎敌人一切新的进攻。
    当此伟大的朝鲜人民从日本侵略者枷锁下解放七周年的时候，中国人民对于朝鲜人民英勇反抗美国侵略者的精神，深致敬意和同情。中国人民深知，中朝两国人民唇齿相依，美国侵略者的侵略朝鲜是和它侵略中国的政策分不开的，因此，中国人民不仅为了援助朝鲜人民，也为了自己保家卫国，一定要用一切力量支援朝鲜人民的正义斗争，使朝鲜得到和平与安全。毛泽东主席在祝贺朝鲜解放七周年的电文中说：“为了抗击共同的敌人，为了朝鲜的和平及中国的安全，中国人民将永远坚定地与朝鲜人民在一起，为彻底战胜美帝国主义侵略者而奋斗。”这代表了全中国人民的共同意志。我们深信中朝两国人民亲密团结的伟大力量，一定能够打败美国侵略者的任何阴谋，朝鲜人民的正义斗争在已经取得的胜利基础上，必然要进一步取得最后的永远的胜利。
