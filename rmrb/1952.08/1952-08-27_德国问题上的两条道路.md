Two Roads on the German Question

    The German question is the central question of Europe. On this question, there are two roads. One is the road taken by the peace-loving Soviet Union, which is to strive to transform Germany, once the source of World War II, into a peace-loving, democratic, and unified Germany, so that Europe will no longer have the possibility of a new war. The other is the road taken by the United States and its partners, Britain and France, who are preparing a new war of aggression. They are trying to permanently divide Germany, occupy West Germany as their main base for launching a new war in Europe, and revive German militarism as their main assistant in preparing and waging a new war in Europe. After the end of World War II, these two distinctly different roads gradually became clear, and an increasingly sharp struggle unfolded between them. Here are some key historical facts.

    In August 1945, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom signed the Potsdam Agreement. Later, France also joined this agreement. This agreement clearly stipulated the principles for dealing with Germany: to eradicate German militarism and Nazism, to ensure that Germany could no longer threaten its neighbors and world peace, and to give the German people the opportunity to build their new life on a democratic and peaceful basis, and ultimately gain a place among the free and peaceful people of the world. In order to implement this principle, the Potsdam Agreement stipulated that the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, which occupied Germany, should jointly deal with general events related to the entire Germany, and the occupying countries should take measures to eliminate German militarism and Nazism and assist in the democratization of Germany. The Potsdam Agreement also stipulated that the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France should be responsible for preparing a peace treaty with Germany, and the German government should accept the peace treaty after the establishment of a unified and peaceful German government.

    After the Soviet Union occupied eastern Germany in 1945, it followed the Potsdam Agreement and implemented a series of thorough measures to eliminate German militarism and Nazism. In the Soviet occupation zone, land reform was implemented and monopoly capital was confiscated, thereby destroying the foundation of German militarism. The Soviet Union assisted the development of German democratic forces.

    From the beginning, the United States, Britain, and France in the three western German occupation zones were reluctant to implement the Potsdam Agreement. The United States, Britain, and France did not take thorough measures to eliminate German militarism and Nazism. On the contrary, they did everything possible to protect German monopoly capital, Junkers landowners, and Nazis, and preserved war factories and part of the fascist armed forces.

    From 1946 onwards, the United States, Britain, and France further took unilateral measures to split Germany, undermining the Potsdam Agreement. In December 1946, the United States and the United Kingdom separately signed an agreement to merge the American and British occupation zones. In August 1947, the American and British occupation zones joined the "Marshall Plan." In June 1948, the United States, Britain, and France separately implemented currency reform in West Germany.

    At the two sessions of the Soviet, American, British, and French Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow and London in 1947, and at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1949, the Soviet Union resolutely opposed the unilateral splitting measures of the United States, Britain, and France, and put forward concrete proposals on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany. However, due to the obstruction of the United States, Britain, and France, the previous Foreign Ministers' Conferences failed to reach important agreements.

    In April 1949, the United States and Britain further unilaterally announced the West German Occupation Statute. In September, the West German split state, created by the United States, Britain, and France, was established.

    In October 1949, German democratic forces established the German Democratic Republic in the Soviet occupation zone. Democratic Germany became the base for the German people's struggle for peaceful reunification.

    In September 1950, the New York Conference of Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and France unilaterally passed a decision to rebuild the German army and revive the German war industry. In July 1951, Western countries unilaterally announced the "end of the state of war with Germany."

    In October 1950, the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries held the Eight Foreign Ministers' Conference in Prague. The conference adopted a resolution opposing the separate decisions of the New York Conference of the United States, Britain, and France, advocating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in the shortest possible time and the implementation of the elimination of German militarism in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. In November, the Soviet Union sent notes to the United States, Britain, and France, suggesting that a four-nation foreign ministers' conference be convened to discuss the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement on the elimination of German militarism. From March to June 1951, the Four-Nation Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference to discuss the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was held in Paris. The conference finally broke down due to the sabotage of the United States, Britain, and France.

    On March 10, April 9, and May 24, 1952, the Soviet Union sent notes to the United States, Britain, and France three times, suggesting that the four countries immediately hold negotiations on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and unifying Germany. The Soviet Union also put forward its draft principles for a peace treaty with Germany in the first note. However, the United States, Britain, and France adopted delaying tactics and refused to hold negotiations immediately.

    On May 26, 1952, the United States, Britain, and France separately signed the "General Treaty" with the West German puppet government, which deepened the division of Germany and openly armed West Germany, completely destroying the Potsdam Agreement. On May 27, the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty, which dragged West Germany into the North Atlantic Group, was signed in Paris. This treaty stipulated the establishment of twelve divisions of Nazi troops in West Germany as part of the "European Army," which is the North Atlantic aggressive army.

    On August 23, 1952, the Soviet Union sent another note to the United States, Britain, and France, suggesting that a four-nation representative conference be convened no later than October to discuss the peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany.

    The new Soviet note is another test for the United States, Britain, and France. If the ruling groups of the three countries still reject the Soviet proposal, they will become more isolated among the people of all countries. At present, the Soviet note has been warmly supported by the people of European countries. The German Democratic Republic is actively striving for the peaceful reunification of Germany. A powerful movement against the "General Treaty" and demanding the conclusion of a treaty in accordance with the Soviet proposal has been launched in West Germany, and people from various strata and with very different political views have participated in this movement. The sentiment of the people of Western European countries demanding a peaceful solution to the German question is also very strong. The struggle of the European people and the German people will surely defeat the US attempt to divide Germany and arm West Germany.

### 德国问题上的两条道路

    德国问题上的两条道路
    德国问题是欧洲的中心问题。在这个问题上，有着两条道路。一条是，爱好和平的苏联所走的道路，这就是努力把曾经成为二次世界大战策源地的德国，变成爱好和平的民主的统一的德国，使欧洲不再有新战争的可能。另一条是，准备新侵略战争的美国及其伙伴英法两国所走的道路，它们力图永远分裂德国，占领西德作为它们在欧洲发动新战争的主要基地，复活德国军国主义作为它们在欧洲准备及进行新战争的主要助手。在第二次世界大战结束以后，这两条截然不同的道路就逐渐明显，相互间展开了日益尖锐的斗争。下面就是一些主要的历史事实。
    一九四五年八月，苏、美、英三国签订了波茨坦协定。后来，法国也参加了这个协定。这个协定明确地规定处置德国的原则是：根除德国的军国主义及纳粹主义，使德国不再能威胁邻邦及世界和平，并给德国人民以机会在民主及和平的基础上建造其新生活，而终能在世界自由及和平人民中获得一位置。为了实行这个原则，波茨坦协定规定：占领德国的苏、美、英、法四国要共同处理有关全德国的一般事件，占领国家要采取肃清德国军国主义及纳粹主义、协助德国民主化的措施。波茨坦协定并规定：由苏、美、英、法四国负责准备对德和约，并在统一的、和平的德国的政府成立以后，由德国政府接受和约。
    苏联在一九四五年占领德国东部以后，就遵照波茨坦协定，实行了一连串彻底肃清德国军国主义及纳粹主义的措施。在苏联占领区内，实行了土地改革并没收了独占资本，从而摧毁了德国军国主义的根基。苏联协助德国的民主力量获得发展。
    美、英、法三国在德国西部三国占领区中自始就对波茨坦协定怠工。美、英、法三国没有采取彻底肃清德国军国主义及纳粹主义的措施，相反地，却竭尽一切力量庇护德国垄断资本、容克地主及纳粹分子，并且保存了战争工厂及一部分法西斯武装力量。
    一九四六年起，美、英、法三国就进而片面采取破坏波茨坦协定的分裂德国的措施。一九四六年十二月，美、英二国单独签订了合并美英占领区的协定。一九四七年八月，美英占领区加入了“马歇尔计划”。一九四八年六月，美、英、法三国在西德单独实行货币改革。
    在一九四七年莫斯科和伦敦二次苏、美、英、法四国外长会议上，在一九四九年巴黎四国外长会议上，苏联都坚决反对美、英、法三国的片面分裂措施，并就缔结对德和约及统一德国问题提出具体建议。但是，由于美、英、法三国的阻挠，历届外长会议都未能获得重要协议。
    一九四九年四月，美英又进一步片面公布了西德占领法规。九月，美、英、法三国一手制造的西德分裂国家成立。
    一九四九年十月，德国民主力量在苏联占领区成立了德意志民主共和国。民主德国成为德国人民争取和平统一斗争的根据地。
    一九五○年九月，美、英、法三国外长纽约会议片面通过重建德国军队及复活德国战争工业的决定。一九五一年七月，西方国家片面宣布“结束对德战争状态”。
    一九五○年十月，苏联、德意志民主共和国及东欧人民民主国家在布拉格举行了八国外长会议，会议通过决定，反对美、英、法三国纽约会议的单独决定，主张在最短期间内缔结对德和约与按照波茨坦协定实行肃清德国军国主义。十一月，苏联照会美、英、法三国，建议召开四国外长会议讨论波茨坦会议关于肃清德国军国主义的协定的实施问题。一九五一年三月至六月，讨论外长会议议程的四国外长助理会议在巴黎举行，会议最后因美、英、法三国的破坏而破裂。
    一九五二年三月十日，四月九日，五月二十四日，苏联三度照会美、英、法三国，建议四国立即举行关于缔结对德和约和统一德国的谈判，苏联并在第一次照会中就提出了它的对德和约原则草案。但是，美、英、法三国采取了拖延策略，拒绝立即举行谈判。
    一九五二年五月二十六日，美、英、法三国单独与西德傀儡政府签订了加深德国分裂、公开武装西德的“一般性条约”，彻底破坏了波茨坦协定。五月二十七日，把西德拖入北大西洋集团的所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约在巴黎签订，这一条约规定在西德建立十二师纳粹军队作为“欧洲军”，也就是北大西洋侵略军的组成部分。
    一九五二年八月二十三日，苏联又照会美、英、法三国，建议至迟在十月份内召开四国代表会议讨论对德和约及统一德国问题。
    苏联新照会对美、英、法三国是又一考验。如果三国统治集团仍拒绝苏联建议，那他们就要在各国人民中更加孤立。目前，苏联照会已获得欧洲各国人民的热烈拥护。德意志民主共和国正为和平统一德国而积极努力。西德境内已展开了一个反对“一般性条约”、要求根据苏联建议缔结和约的强大运动，各个不同的阶层和政治见解差别很大的人们都参加了这个运动。西欧各国人民要求和平解决德国问题的情绪也十分强烈。欧洲人民和德国人民的斗争一定会使美国分裂德国、武装西德的企图遭到失败。（新华社）
