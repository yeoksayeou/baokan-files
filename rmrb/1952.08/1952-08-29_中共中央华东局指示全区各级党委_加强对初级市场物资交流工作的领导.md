The CPC Central Committee East China Bureau Directs Party Committees at All Levels in the Region to Strengthen Leadership Over Primary Market Materials Exchange Work

The CPC Central Committee East China Bureau has issued instructions to CPC committees at all levels in the East China region, requiring them to strengthen the materials exchange work in primary markets. The instructions pointed out that further strengthening the leadership of commercial work and carrying out materials exchange to invigorate markets at all levels, especially primary markets, remains the central task of party committees at all levels. Provincial (regional) committees and district committees should vigorously assist county and district party committees in establishing leadership over invigorating the market and materials exchange work, so that county and district party committees can truly "face the primary market" and be able to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. This is currently the primary link in implementing the materials exchange policy and improving the situation in primary markets. The instructions proposed that provincial (regional) committees, district committees, and county committees should convene a financial and economic work conference in the near future, inviting grassroots party and government work cadres to participate in the meeting, to summarize the summer materials exchange work and arrange the autumn materials exchange work. At the same time, organize typical reports to introduce successful experiences and educate cadres ideologically and politically.

The instructions also required provincial (regional) committees, district committees, and county committees in the East China region to organize strong work teams to immediately create typical experiences in primary market materials exchange work, and requested party committees at all levels to conduct systematic investigations and research to truly grasp the situation in primary markets, identify the main problems existing in the implementation of specific policies such as price differences, taxation, transportation, market management, and public-private relations by party and government workers in various places, and find solutions to these problems. Then, on this basis, hold a good primary market materials exchange conference. The instructions require party committees at all levels to obtain this experience by the end of August and the beginning of September, to ensure that various policies and measures related to materials exchange are fully implemented before the arrival of the autumn harvest season.

    中共中央华东局指示全区各级党委
    加强对初级市场物资交流工作的领导
    中共中央华东局已向华东区各级中共党委会发出指示，要求加强初级市场的物资交流工作。指示中指出：进一步加强商业工作的领导，开展物资交流，使各级市场特别是初级市场活跃起来，仍是各级党委会当前中心任务。各省（区）委会、地委会应大力帮助县、区党委会建立对活跃市场和物资交流工作的领导，使县、区党委会真正做到“面向初级市场”，并且能够及时发现问题，解决问题。这是目前贯彻物资交流政策，改善初级市场情况的首要环节。指示内提出：各省（区）委会和地委会、县委会应在最近召开一次财经工作会议，吸收下层党、政工作骨干分子参加会议，以总结夏季物资交流工作，和布置秋季物资交流工作，同时组织典型报告，介绍成功经验，从思想上、政策上教育干部。
    指示中又要求华东区各省（区）委会、地委会、县委会组织坚强的工作队，立即创造初级市场物资交流工作的典型经验，并要求各地党委会作系统的调查研究，切实掌握初级市场情况，找出各地党、政工作人员在执行差价、税收、运输、市场管理、公私关系等具体政策方面存在着那些主要问题，并找出解决问题的办法，然后在这基础上开好初级市场物资交流会议。指示要求各地党委会在八月底、九月初旬取得此项经验，以保证秋收旺季到来前，将有关物资交流的各项政策、措施完全贯彻下去。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
