The Central Trade Department issued a notice to all trade departments under its jurisdiction throughout the country to promote experiences and, based on existing problems in the industrial product promotion campaign, propose specific approaches. The notice first pointed out that since the Central Trade Department issued instructions in mid-June on launching an industrial product sales campaign, trade administrations and professional companies in various regions have attached importance to the leadership of this campaign and made specific arrangements. According to materials from various locations, companies above the provincial level have begun to take action and have achieved initial results. Sales revenue in early July increased by 33% compared to early June; new experiences have also been gained in improving business management. For example, the Shanghai Department Store Company, in order to improve operations, held internal material exchange meetings, displaying samples of stocked goods with prices, quantities, and backlog dates marked, organizing representatives of purchasing agents, warehouse keepers, and salespersons to visit, discuss, and analyze the reasons for backlogs, and study ways to open up sales channels. This not only helps to find good ways to promote backlog goods, but more importantly, it can educate all employees, making everyone aware of the great losses caused to the country in the past due to poor coordination and disconnection in work. The mutual support and competition agreement signed between state-owned companies and cooperatives, and transportation departments in Baoding City, Hebei Province, is a powerful guarantee for mutual cooperation between departments to overcome departmentalism in the work of promoting industrial products, and should be further developed into internal collective contracts between departments. Because this method has a significant impact on improving work systems and realizing business plans. The East China Petroleum Company and the Shanghai Industrial Equipment Company have both held user symposiums, introducing the specifications, prices, and performance of commodities to customers through symposiums, in order to change the views of some users who are accustomed to using American and British products, and to listen to customer opinions in order to improve business management. This method is of great help to industrial equipment, petroleum, medicine, department stores and other companies in promoting goods imported from the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries.

Regarding several existing problems and improvement methods in the promotion campaign, the notice pointed out:

(1) The deployment, mobilization, and other preparatory work for the current industrial product promotion campaign are not deep or widespread enough. In order to further develop the campaign, the top leader must take responsibility, take action personally, conduct in-depth mobilization through various meetings, clarify the guidelines and tasks, so that every employee can fully understand the significance of the campaign, and implement the spirit of graded deployment and layer-by-layer responsibility.

(2) The policy of "wholesale as the main focus," uniting private merchants, and jointly enlivening the urban and rural economy should be implemented. The statements such as "wholesale is difficult to find customers in rural areas, retail is easy to wait for customers in cities," and "being afraid of dealing with private merchants" are incorrect. Private merchants and peddlers should not be generally regarded as speculative behavior because of their short capital and purchase goods twice a day.

(3) Market management should be carried out appropriately. In the past two or three years, in the case of insufficient industrial products, some areas have adopted strict market management methods to stabilize the market, which is correct; but today, in the case where the quantity and sources of industrial products mastered by the state are very sufficient, administrative management should be appropriately relaxed. It is hoped that all localities will conduct inspections based on their specific circumstances and make appropriate corrections. Some unnecessary permits can be abolished, but at the same time, attention must be paid to preventing the bias of blindly abolishing them without review.

(4) Strengthen allocation and prevent out-of-stock situations: In the campaign, attention must be paid to doing a good job in allocation. If the control and coordination in this regard are not good, it is most likely to cause out-of-stock situations. In particular, overstocked goods and seasonal goods should be given high attention.

    中央贸易部通报推销工业品的经验和做法
    中央人民政府贸易部为深入开展工业品销售运动，特向全国所属各贸易部门发出情况通报，推广经验，并根据工业品推销运动中所存在的问题，提出具体做法。通报首先指出：自六月中旬中央贸易部发出了关于开展工业品销售运动的指示以来，各区贸易行政部门与各专业公司都重视了这一运动的领导工作，并作了具体的布置。根据各地材料，省以上的公司都已开始行动，并获得了初步的成绩。七月上旬的卖钱额，较六月上旬增加百分之三十三；在改善经营管理方面，也获得了一些新的经验。如上海市百货公司为改善经营举办公司内部物资交流会，把库存商品小样标明价格、数量与积压日期，陈列展览，组织采购员、保管员、推销员的代表参观，讨论分析积压原因，研究打开销路。这样不仅可以找出推销积压商品的好办法，更重要的是，可以教育全体职工，使大家认识到，过去因工作配合不好，相互间脱节给国家造成的很大损失。河北省保定市各国营公司间和合作社与运输部门间签订的相互支持竞赛协议书，是在推销工业品工作中各部门相互配合克服本位主义的有力保证，应进一步发展为各部门间的内部集体合同。因为这办法对改进工作制度，实现业务计划都具有重大的作用。华东区石油公司与上海市工业器材公司都曾召开过用户座谈会，通过座谈会向顾主介绍商品的规格、价格与性能，以改变某些用户惯用英美产品的观点，并听取顾主意见，以改善经营管理。这一方法对工业器材、石油、医药、百货等公司推销从苏联及新民主主义国家进口的商品，是有很大帮助的。
    关于推销运动中的几个现存问题和改进办法，通报指出：
    （一）现在工业品推销运动的布置、动员等准备工作尚不够深入、普遍。为了使运动进一步开展，必须首长负责，亲自动手，通过各种会议，深入动员，明确方针任务，使每一个职工都能充分认识运动的意义，贯彻逐级布置，层层负责的精神。
    （二）应贯彻“以批发为主”，团结私商，共同活跃城乡经济的方针。“乡村主要是扩大批发，城市主要是扩大零售”，“批发找主难，零售等主易”等说法是不对的，怕和私商往来也是不对的。私商小贩因资金短绌，一日购两次货，也不应一律认为是投机行为。
    （三）应适当地进行市场管理。过去两三年来，在工业品不足的情况下，为稳定市场，某些地区曾采用严格地市场管理办法，是对的；但在今天国家所掌握的工业品数量和来源已很充足的情况下，应适当放宽行政管理。希望各地根据具体情况，进行检查，适当的加以修正。对一些不必要的证照可予废除，但同时必须注意防止不加审查，便盲目废除的偏向。
    （四）加强调拨，严防脱销：在运动中必须注意作好调拨工作，如在这方面掌握、配合不好，是最易发生脱销情况的。尤其是积压过多的商品和时令货，更要予以高度注意。    （新华社）
