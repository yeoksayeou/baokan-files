    Xinhua News Agency, August 21st Dispatch from Tokyo: The conspiracy of the American and Japanese reactionaries to restore the conscription system in Japan and gather cannon fodder is encountering increasingly resolute resistance from the Japanese people.

    People of all classes in Japan are stepping up the anti-conscription movement. Recently, the Oita Prefecture branch of the Japan Farmers' Association passed a resolution against the implementation of conscription and collected 3,400 signatures for this resolution. An anti-conscription protest meeting was also held in Hita, in the same prefecture. Working women in government agencies, under the slogan of "Don't let loved ones and brothers go to war," launched a signature campaign against conscription. In the Cabinet Statistics Bureau, despite the authorities' threat that "signatures are being collected by red elements," members of the women's department of the union are still quietly passing around signature sheets. As early as June, working women in government agencies had already collected nearly 7,000 signatures.

    The growing anti-conscription movement has made it very difficult for the Yoshida government to expand the "Police Reserve Force." The "Police Reserve Force" originally planned to recruit 4,500 new members in Niigata Prefecture, but, according to a broadcast by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation on the 13th, there were only a mere twenty applicants. In a certain district of Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture, the plan was to recruit 365 people for the "Police Reserve Force," but in reality, only ten people applied. The youth organization of Matsukawa Village, Kitaazumi County, Nagano Prefecture, passed a resolution: "Oppose the use of training grounds for the Police Reserve Force, and the village head will not recommend any villagers to become members of the Police Reserve Force." This resolution quickly gained the support of seven villages and towns in the southern part of Matsukawa Village and gradually expanded into a joint resolution of youth organizations in both Kitaazumi and Minamiauzmi counties.

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo: When the anti-popular "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" came into effect on July 21, 250 Japanese patriots detained in Kosuge Prison went on a hunger strike to protest. These Japanese patriots were illegally arrested because of the May Day and May 30th incidents, and the closure of the democratic newspaper "Voice of Peace". While on hunger strike, they called for the smashing of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" and demanded the immediate release of innocent arrested patriots. They also supported the demands of court employees regarding the issuance of summer allowances and advocated for improving the treatment of court employees. To support their struggle, the families of the arrested Japanese patriots held a family meeting at Kosuge Prison on July 22, protested to the prison authorities, and issued appeals to various labor unions and democratic organizations.

    日本各阶层人民加紧展开反对征兵运动
    吉田政府扩充“警察后备队”计划遭到坚决抵抗
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：美、日反动派企图在日本恢复征兵制和搜罗炮灰的阴谋，遭到日本人民愈来愈坚决的抵抗。
    日本各阶层的人民正在加紧推进反对征兵运动。最近，日本农民协会大分县分会通过了反对实行征兵制的决议，并为这个决议征集了三千四百个签名。该县日田地方还举行了反对征兵的抗议大会。在政府机关工作的劳动妇女，在“不让爱人和哥哥去当兵”的口号下，展开了反对征兵的签名运动。在内阁统计局，尽管当局威胁地说：“签名是赤色分子搞的”，但是，工会妇女部的会员却依然悄悄地传递着签名纸。早在六月间，政府机关的劳动妇女就已征集了将近七千个签名。
    日益增长的反对征兵运动，已经使吉田政府扩充“警察后备队”的计划，遭到很大的困难。“警察后备队”原订在新潟县招募四千五百名新队员，但是，据十三日的日本广播协会的广播说，应募者只有寥寥的二十名。在宫城县石卷市某区，根据计划应为“警察后备队”招募三百六十五人，但实际上只有十人应征。长野县北安昙郡松川村的青年组织曾经决议：“反对警察后备队征用演习场，村长不推荐一个村民去当警察后备队队员。”这项决议迅速获得松川村南部七个村镇的拥护，并逐渐扩大成为北安昙和南安昙两郡的青年组织的共同决议。
    【新华社讯】东京消息：当反人民的“防止破坏活动法”在七月二十一日开始生效的时候，被拘押在小菅监狱的二百五十名日本爱国者，曾一致实行绝食，表示抗议。这些日本爱国者是因为“五一”节和“五·三○”事件以及民主报纸“和平之声”的被封闭而被非法逮捕的。他们在实行绝食的时候，号召粉碎“防止破坏活动法”，要求立即释放无辜被捕的爱国者。他们并支持法院职员关于发给夏季津贴的要求，主张改善法院职员的待遇。被捕的日本爱国者的家属为了支援他们的斗争，于七月二十二日在小菅监狱召开家属大会，向监狱当局提出抗议，并向各工会和民主团体发出呼吁。
