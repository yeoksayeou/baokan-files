    Correcting Dogmatic Tendencies in Learning

    Currently, cadres in various regions are beginning to study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" one after another. In the process of learning, many units are able to adhere to study time, abide by study systems, and participants can also diligently study documents and raise questions, which are all good things.

    However, there are still some dogmatic learning tendencies in the learning process. This tendency has occurred more or less in various regions in the past, and it is still prevalent today. For example, recently, Tianjin municipal government cadres also showed this dogmatic tendency in studying "On Practice." The specific manifestations of this tendency are: First, fixating on terminology. Both new and old cadres exhibit this phenomenon; it seems that some people are particularly interested in fixating on terminology, spending one or two hours, or even occupying the entire day's study and discussion time. The second is aiming too high and divorced from reality. Some comrades do not deeply study the central content of the documents, but focus on those unimportant and specialized issues, raising a series of them. No problem can be solved. The third is quoting out of context and making far-fetched analogies. Especially some intellectuals, they do not comprehend the spirit and essence of the documents, but seize one or two sentences and treat them as formulas, applying them indiscriminately everywhere, raising questions such as "Do animals have dynamic function?" "What will humans evolve into?" and so on.

    This dogmatic learning method is not only practically meaningless, but also extremely harmful. The purpose of our learning is mainly to understand the spirit and essence of Chairman Mao's works, and to learn his position, viewpoints, and methods of observing and dealing with problems, so that we can apply them when dealing with practical problems ourselves. Therefore, our learning should focus on solving our own ideological and work method problems. In particular, comrades with more work experience should combine their own experiences to read the documents in order to more deeply appreciate the spirit of the documents.

    The study of terminology and certain specialized philosophical issues does indeed involve the understanding of documents. However, we must grasp the purpose of learning. If these terms and philosophical issues are of great importance to our learning purpose, and we cannot grasp the spirit and essence of the documents without understanding them, such as the terms "sensibility" and "rationality," "practice" and "knowledge," we must clarify their meanings. However, for those less relevant terms and specialized philosophical issues, we can temporarily ignore them if we cannot understand them. In short, because of the differences in political experience and cultural and theoretical levels, the degree of understanding among participants will inevitably vary greatly. In discussions, only one or two of the most common and most important issues should be selected and focused on for resolution. Any aim too high, or research into trivial matters, is impractical. All kinds of dogmatic learning methods must be prevented and overcome.

### 纠正学习中的教条主义倾向

    纠正学习中的教条主义倾向
    目前各地干部正先后开始学习“毛泽东选集”，在学习中许多单位都能坚持学习时间，遵守学习制度，参加学习的人也能认真钻研文件，提出问题，这都是好的。
    但在学习中还存在一些教条主义的学习倾向，这种倾向过去在各地都或多或少地发生过，即在今天也仍是带有普遍性的。如最近天津市机关干部在学习“实践论”中也表现了这种教条主义的倾向。这种倾向的具体表现：第一是扣名词，不管新老干部都有这种情况，似乎有些人对扣名词特别感兴趣，一扣就是一、两个钟头，甚至把一天全部的学习讨论时间都占据了。第二种是好高鹜远，不从实际出发。有些同志对文件的中心内容并不深入钻研，偏偏对那些无关紧要的专门问题，一提就是一连串。什么问题也不能解决。第三种是断章取义，牵强附会。特别是有些知识分子，他不去领会文件的精神和实质，而是抓住一两句话，就把它当成公式，到处生搬硬套，提出什么“动物有没有能动作用？”“人还会发展成什么？”之类的问题。
    这种教条主义的学习方法不但毫无实际意义，而且是极端有害的。我们学习的目的，主要是理解毛主席著作的精神和实质，学习他观察问题对待问题的立场观点和方法，以便于我们自己在处理实际问题的时候能够运用。因此我们学习就应该着重解决自己的思想方法和工作方法问题。特别是工作经验较多的同志更应结合自己的经验来阅读文件，以便更深入地体会文件的精神。
    关于名词和某些专门哲学问题的研究，的确也涉及到对文件的理解问题。但是我们必须把握学习的目的，如果这些名词和哲学问题与我们学习的目的有重要关系，不了解就不能掌握文件的精神与实质，如对于“感性”与“理性”、“实践”与“认识”等名词，都必须把它的含义弄清楚，但是，对于那些关系不大的名词及专门哲学问题，弄不通的就可以暂时不管。总之，参加学习的人，因为政治经验和文化理论水平的差别，理解的程度必然有许多不同，在讨论时只能选择一两个最普遍、最主要的问题着重加以解决。任何好高鹜远与枝枝节节的研究都是不切实际的，各色各样的教条主义的学习方法都必须加以防止和克服。
