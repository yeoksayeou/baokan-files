The Fourth Beijing Municipal People's Congress listened to Mayor Peng Zhen's report summarizing the work of the past year and a half and the current central tasks, and listened to the reports and plans of the Beijing Municipal People's Government on the estimated financial revenue and expenditure, the patriotic production increase and economization campaign, the patriotic health campaign, and the rapid literacy campaign, and examined written reports on other tasks. After repeated discussions, the representatives unanimously expressed their satisfaction and full acceptance.

Over the past three years, Beijing has made tremendous progress in production. The total industrial output value in 1951 was two and a half times that of 1950 and more than eight times that of 1949. Among them, the production of state-owned industries was nearly ten times that of 1949, and the production of private industries was more than six times that of 1949. This achievement shows that Beijing has rapidly moved from a consumer city towards a production city, and Beijing's industry is developing rapidly, with state-owned industries developing faster than private industries. This achievement in production development and economic prosperity was made possible because the Beijing Municipal People's Government implemented correct leadership under the direct guidance of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government and under the conditions of improved national economic conditions.

The Beijing Municipal People's Government's final accounts for the 1951 fiscal year and the estimated financial revenue and expenditure for the 1952 fiscal year not only eliminated the deficit in the budget, but also increased the proportion of operating expenses in the total expenditure year by year. In the 1951 final accounts, operating expenses accounted for 69.39 percent of the total expenditure, and in the 1952 budget, operating expenses increased to 75.13 percent. If the special funds allocated by the central government are added, operating expenses will increase to 82.66 percent. In addition to production investment, the rest of the operating expenses are used for culture, education, health, municipal construction, and social undertakings, that is, directly for the welfare of the people of this city. This is the financial manifestation of the rapid progress in various aspects of Beijing's construction over the past three years.

The entire body of representatives of the Fourth Beijing Municipal People's Congress fully supports the current central tasks proposed by Mayor Peng Zhen: carrying out the patriotic production increase and economization campaign, the patriotic health campaign, the rapid literacy campaign, and measures to improve the health of workers and students. We believe that these central tasks are preparing favorable conditions for our large-scale economic and cultural construction. All the people of Beijing should make great efforts to carry out these tasks. The central key to the production increase and economization campaign is to summarize and promote advanced experience, improve technology, improve labor organization, and increase production efficiency. At the same time, we believe that summarizing and promoting advanced experience is not only a key issue in production, but also a key issue in promoting other tasks. In all our work positions, we should highly promote creativity and vigorously promote advanced experience. We believe that the significance of the patriotic health campaign and the rapid literacy campaign is not only to improve culture and improve people's health, but also to have an inseparable relationship with developing production and carrying out large-scale economic construction. Therefore, we call on people from all walks of life to continue to carry out the patriotic health campaign and widely launch the rapid literacy campaign, so that our Beijing will further become a cleaner and more highly cultured people's capital. We will complete these central tasks to welcome the high tide of economic construction and the high tide of cultural construction in our motherland.

    北京市第四届第一次各界人民代表会议关于政府工作报告的决议
    北京市第四届各界人民代表会议听取了彭真市长关于过去一年半的工作总结和当前中心工作的报告，听取了北京市人民政府关于财政收支概算、爱国增产节约运动、爱国卫生运动、速成识字运动的报告和计划，并审查了其他各项工作的书面报告，经过反复讨论，一致认为满意，并表示全部接受。
    三年来北京市在生产上有极大的发展，一九五一年的工业生产总值等于一九五零年的两倍半，等于一九四九年的八倍多，其中，国营工业的生产等于一九四九年的十倍弱，私营工业的生产等于六倍强。这样的成就，说明北京市已经迅速地从消费的城市向着生产的城市迈进，北京市的工业已经在很快的进展，国营工业比私营工业发展得更快些。这是因为北京市人民政府在毛主席和中央人民政府的直接指导下实行了正确的领导和在全国经济情况好转的条件下，才能够获得的生产发展和经济繁荣的成就。
    北京市人民政府一九五一年度的财政收支决算和一九五二年度的财政收支概算，不但消灭了预算中的赤字，而且使事业费在整个开支中的比重逐年增加，在一九五一年的决算中，事业费占支出总额的百分之六十九点三九，在一九五二年的预算中，事业费增加到百分之七十五点一三，如加上中央所拨的各项专款，事业费即增加到百分之八十二点六六。事业费中除生产投资以外，其余是用于文教、卫生、市政建设和社会事业，即直接用于本市人民的福利上。这是北京市三年来各方面建设的突飞猛进，在财政方面的表现。
    北京市第四届各界人民代表会议全体代表完全拥护彭真市长所提出的当前的几项中心工作：开展爱国增产节约运动、爱国卫生运动、速成识字运动和改善工人、学生等健康的措施等。我们认为这几项中心工作是为我们的大规模的经济建设和文化建设准备有利的条件。我们北京市的全体人民都应该以极大的努力来进行这些工作。增产节约运动的中心关键是总结和推广先进经验、改进技术、改善劳动组织、提高生产效率。同时，我们认为总结与推广先进经验不仅是生产上的关键问题，也是推进其他各项工作的关键问题，我们在各种工作的岗位上，都应当高度发扬创造性，并大力来推广先进经验。我们认为爱国卫生运动和速成识字运动的意义，不仅是提高文化、改进人民健康，而且与发展生产、进行大规模的经济建设有不可分离的关系。因此，我们号召各界人民继续进行爱国卫生运动，并广泛展开速成识字运动，要使我们北京市进一步成为更清洁和更有高度文化的人民首都。我们要以完成这几项中心工作来迎接我们祖国的经济建设高潮和文化建设高潮。
