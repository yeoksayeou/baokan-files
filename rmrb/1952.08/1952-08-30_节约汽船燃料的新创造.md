    New Invention for Saving Steamboat Fuel
    Editor: Wang Lansen, an old worker at the Xiangtan Ferry steamboat in Hunan Province, successfully researched and utilized waste gas from cars during crossings to power the steamboat engine, saving the country more than 3,440 liters of gasoline in half a year (February to July).
    The Xiangtan Ferry steamboat frequently ferries cars. After the cars are on board, they are not turned off to make it easier to start them when reaching the uphill on the opposite bank. Based on this situation, Wang Lansen researched and utilized the waste gas from the cars to power the steamboat engine, saving steamboat fuel. His method is to use a lead wire rubber tube to cover the "choke" (air intake door) of the crossing car's engine, and then use an iron pipe connected to the bottom of the steamboat engine's carburetor, installing a "choke" and a "three-way switch" at this point, allowing the gas from the car to pass through the rubber tube and iron pipe to power the steamboat engine.
    Wang Lansen's rationalization proposal has attracted the attention of the Central-South Communications Department. After the Central-South Communications Department sent people to inspect, it proved that this method has many advantages: saving gasoline, reducing costs, not affecting the speed of the boat, cars can be driven on and off at any time, and improving traffic efficiency. The Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau has requested that more than 30 ferries throughout the province learn from Wang Lansen's advanced experience.　Wang Zhongjie

    节约汽船燃料的新创造
    编辑同志：湖南省湘潭渡口汽船上的老工人王兰森，研究出利用过渡时汽车上的废煤气发动汽船引擎成功，半年（二月—七月）为国家节省汽油三千四百四十多公升。
    湘潭渡口的汽船，经常摆渡汽车。汽车上船后，为了到达对岸上坡时便于发动，并不停火。王兰森根据这种情况，研究出利用汽车上的废煤气，发动汽船引擎，节约汽船用油。他的办法是用一根铅丝橡皮管套在过渡汽车引擎的“合风”（进空气的门）上，再用一根铁管接到汽船引擎化油器的下面，在此处装上“合风”和“三门开关”，使汽车上的煤气通过皮管、铁管来发动汽船引擎。
    王兰森的这一合理化建议，引起了中南交通部的重视。经中南交通部派人检查，证明这种方法有许多优点：节约汽油，减低成本，不影响行船速度，汽车可以随到随开，提高了行车效率。湖南省公路局已要求全省三十多个渡口，学习王兰森的先进经验。　王中杰
