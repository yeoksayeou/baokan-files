    Seeing Photos of Aerial Forest Protection
    Increases My Love for the Motherland
    Comrade Editor: I saw the photos of forest protection planes patrolling over forest areas in the "Our Great Motherland" section of the People's Daily on August 14th, which increased my love for our great motherland. This is something that never existed and was impossible in China's past. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao could there be such an innovation.

    When I went to the Inner Mongolia forest area to do fire prevention work in 1950, I heard some comrades talk about it as a fantasy, saying, "If we had planes to patrol for fires, we could put out the fires in time and protect our great forests." I thought it was an unrealistic idea, but today it has been proven by the facts. This proves that as long as we are under the leadership of the Party, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. This event further increases my love for our great motherland and my confidence in building our great motherland.

    看了航空护林的照片
    增加我对祖国的热爱
    编辑同志：我在八月十四日人民日报“我们伟大的祖国”栏内看到了护林飞机在林区上空巡逻的照片，增加了我对我们伟大祖国的热爱。这是在中国过去的历史上根本没有过，也不可能有的事，只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下才能有这样的创举。
    当我在一九五○年去内蒙古林区做防火工作的时候，听到有的同志在当作幻想而谈到“如果有飞机给我们巡视火情，我们就能及时扑灭火灾，保护了我们的大森林”时，我还以为这是不切合实际的想法，然而今天却被事实证明了。由此可以证明只要在党的领导下，是没有什么克服不了的困难的。从这一件事情更增加了我对我们伟大祖国的热爱和建设我们伟大祖国的信心。　　　　沈启诚
