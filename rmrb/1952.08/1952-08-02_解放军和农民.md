It is a pity that my clumsy hand cannot fully express the many touching things I have seen. However, these things constantly excite me, compelling me to summon the courage to record fragments of them.

In Xiguan, Huolu County, Hebei Province, there is an old lady named Kong, in her fifties. A company headquarters of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was stationed in her home. A few days before the Dragon Boat Festival this year, the old lady asked the comrades, "Comrades, how many of you are staying at my house?" To maintain secrecy, none of the comrades told her. Unable to get an answer, she counted them one by one during their drills, meals, and classes. In a few days, she got the exact number and was very happy. "Got it, twenty in total!" she said to her youngest daughter, Afang. This was already the third day of the fifth lunar month. That day, the mother and daughter didn't sleep all night, making four zongzi (sticky rice dumplings) for each of the comrades. As they worked, they murmured, "The comrades work so hard, protecting us ordinary people day and night; they must have a good meal for the festival this time." Afang said, "Yes, look how yellow this rice is, and the dates are so red and bright!"

On the morning of the fourth day, the mother and daughter carried eighty zongzi to the comrades. The discipline of the People's Liberation Army is strict. Although the mother and daughter repeatedly urged them to eat and "persuaded" them for a full hour, they were ultimately refused. That evening, because the PLA comrades did not eat their food, they felt very upset. Old Lady Kong tossed and turned, unable to sleep, and Afang began to sob. The old lady stroked Afang's head and said, "Child, don't cry, I have a way to make the comrades eat the zongzi."

On the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival, every family celebrated joyfully. The comrades went out for morning exercises early. This kept Afang and her mother very busy. They hurriedly emptied a large vat, filled it with water, put the eighty zongzi in, and moved it into the comrades' room. Afang wrote a crooked note and pasted it on the vat: "Dear PLA Uncles: Four for each person, please eat them, or they will spoil!" Afterwards, Old Lady Kong locked her own room and took Afang to her eldest daughter's house, staying there for seven or eight days. Before leaving, the old lady said triumphantly, "Let's see if you eat them or not!" Although they themselves did not have a good Dragon Boat Festival, they felt very happy.

When the comrades returned from their exercises and saw the situation, they knew that if they didn't eat the zongzi soon, they would spoil. They decided to eat them and give the old lady 500 yuan per zongzi when she returned. In the end, Old Lady Kong firmly refused to accept the money.

I was very moved when I heard this story. When I visited Old Lady Kong, she said, "I just wanted them to eat something; if they didn't, I felt like I had a disease in my heart." The soldiers who ate the zongzi said, "When we ate the zongzi, we felt like our own mother had made them. The people treat us this way, and we must protect the people even better."

This is how the people treat the People's Liberation Army. Now let's see how the People's Liberation Army treats the people.

Everyone knows that this year the peasants are working hard to achieve a bumper harvest. In June, all kinds of crops grew lush and green, almost waist-high. Lu Migui, a labor model and high-yield household in Taitou Village, applied 400 jin of fine fertilizer to each mu of cotton field, and the cotton stalks were as thick as thumbs. Like other farmers, he wanted to rush to the fields early in the morning to take a look. People's enthusiasm for production was very high, and they were thinking about all kinds of ways to increase production, thinking about a bright future.

On the afternoon of July 7th, the northwest corner of the sky suddenly turned dark, with dense clouds and rain, and constant thunder. The villagers in this village and nearby villages all wanted to plant yams before the rain. People planting yams were everywhere. But unexpectedly, a whirlwind brought on a hail disaster unprecedented in decades. The hailstones were as big as iron teapots, and the smaller ones were the size of red dates. The large hailstones pierced through the roofs of houses and even broke the copper ladles inside. The wind was also terrifyingly strong. A seventeen-year-old girl, carrying a spade to plant yams, was swept away seven li (3.5 kilometers) along with her spade. A horse-drawn cart was also blown four li (2 kilometers) with both the people and the horse.

One can imagine the scene at the time: the people planting yams in the fields could not run away in time, and many were knocked down and injured. At this moment, all the medical staff of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the area rapidly gathered together. Dozens of doctors and hundreds of non-medical personnel swore an oath at the regimental headquarters: "We are the people's army, we must protect the people, and we must use the spirit of combat to rescue our fellow villagers, not fearing to sacrifice ourselves..." Braving the wind and hail, hundreds of People's Liberation Army personnel selflessly began to rescue the injured peasants, carrying the injured back to the village one after another for emergency treatment. At this time, some PLA comrades were also injured by the hailstones. The injured villagers forgot their own pain and shouted, "Comrades, go back quickly! Taking care of you is more important than taking care of us!" The comrades seemed not to hear, wiping the blood from their heads and continuing to rescue the villagers. A woman in her thirties was struck on the head, and a comrade went to rescue her. She said, "Comrade, go back quickly! You are also injured!" This comrade insisted on carrying her on his back, but after only a few steps, both of them died together!

In the fight against this hailstorm, the PLA comrades used their blood and lives to save more than 500 villagers. Two of their own comrades died, and more than ten were injured.

Yesterday, the crops were still lush and green, but now they were all gone! The farmers' morale suddenly plummeted. Many high-yield households wept bitterly.

Seeing this situation, the PLA comrades were determined to help the villagers overcome their difficulties, and launched a disaster relief donation campaign. The soldiers squeezed out their money for smoking and donated it to the peasants, ten thousand at a time. In just one day, they donated more than ten million yuan. The entire regiment also suspended classes for three days to help the villagers replant. This spirit of the comrades deeply moved the peasants. The peasants felt that pessimism was unreasonable and that they were letting down the PLA comrades, so they were determined to overcome the disaster. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, all the people in the county mobilized. Various organizations and groups also launched disaster relief donation campaigns; the masses in non-disaster villages automatically organized livestock to help with plowing and rushed to the heavily affected villages overnight to help with replanting. Farmer Li Guotang sent his two dan (approximately 100 kg) of grain seeds to the village people's government for the villagers to sow. Two women carried their own grain seeds dozens of li (a dozen or more kilometers) and sent them to the district people's government for use by the people in the disaster-stricken villages.

Replanting began. PLA comrades and men and women farmers worked together, pulling plows and planting machines, working intensely. In the fields, the farmers' songs and laughter could be heard again. Three or four days later, the replanting work throughout the county was completed. The hearts of the people throughout the county were settled. They said, "Without the help of the PLA comrades, we could not have replanted so quickly. Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao can the military and the people be united so well, and can we overcome such great difficulties." The farmers went to the leading organs and to the cadres from the county who were working in the villages, requesting that a meeting be held to mourn the two PLA comrades who had sacrificed. The farmers throughout the county automatically sent dozens of silk banners to the People's Liberation Army, inscribed with the words: "Model of Loving the People," "The Military and the People are One Family," and "People's Heroes."

After a period of time, "the earth returned to spring": the trees that had been destroyed sprouted new buds, and the seedlings of the replanted crops grew vigorously again. The farmers sang loudly, "With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, we have overcome the natural disaster; we must be more united, more hardworking, and continue to strive for a bumper harvest..."

    解放军和农民

    可惜得很，我这只拙笨的手，无法把我看到的许多感人的事情完全表现出来。可是，这些事情时时在激动着我，使我不能不鼓起勇气，把它的片断记录下来。
    河北省获鹿县西关有位五十多岁的孔老大娘。她家里住了中国人民解放军某部的一个中队部。今年端阳节的前几天，老大娘见了同志们就问：“同志，在咱家住着你们几个？”同志们为了保密，谁也没有告诉她。她没有办法，就在同志们出操、吃饭、上课的时候，一个一个地数。没有几天，她数准了，心里非常乐。“清啦，共二十个！”她向她的小女儿阿芳说。这天已经是旧历五月初三了。当天，娘儿俩一夜没有合眼，给同志们每人包了四个粽子。她俩一边忙一边念叨：“同志们真辛苦，白天黑夜都在保护咱们老百姓；这回过节，可得让他们美美地吃一顿。”阿芳说：“是呀。你瞧，这米多黄呀，枣儿也红得耀眼！”
    初四早上，娘儿俩把八十个粽子抬到同志们的跟前。解放军的纪律是严明的。虽然娘儿俩再三让他们吃，并“说服”了足有一个钟头，最后还是被谢绝了。这天晚上，因为解放军的同志没有吃她们的东西，她们心里很不痛快。孔老大娘翻来覆去地总是睡不着，阿芳一抽一抽地哭开了。大娘摸着阿芳的头说：“孩子，别哭，我自有办法让同志们吃粽子。”
    端阳节的早晨，家家都欢乐地过节。同志们一清早就下操去了。这时忙坏了阿芳娘儿俩。娘儿俩急忙把大缸腾出来，倒上水，把八十个粽子倒进去，搬到同志们的屋里。阿芳歪歪扭扭地写了个纸条，贴在缸上：“解放军叔叔：每人四个，请吃吧，不然就坏了！”随后，孔老大娘把自己的屋门锁上，带上阿芳到大女儿家，一住住了七八天。临走时，大娘得意地说：“看你们吃不吃！”虽然她们自己没有过好端阳节，可是心里很痛快。
    同志们出操回来，一看这情形，知道如果再不吃，粽子很快就会坏了，便决定吃掉，等大娘回来再按每个五百元给她钱。结果，孔老大娘坚决不要钱。
    我听到这件事，很受感动。当我访问孔老大娘的时候，她这样说：“我打算让他们吃点什么，如果他们不吃，我心里就像有块病一样。”吃粽子的战士们说：“我们吃粽子的时候，总觉得这是自己的母亲给做的。人民这样对待我们，我们更要好好保卫人民。”
    老百姓就是这样地对待人民解放军。再看一看解放军怎样对待老百姓吧。
    谁都知道，今年农民都在努力争取大丰收。六月里，各样庄稼都长得绿油油的，足有半腰深。台头村劳动模范丰产户路米贵，在每亩棉花地里施了四百斤细肥，棉花棵有大拇指粗。和其他农民一样，他一清早起来就想跑到地里去看一趟。人们的生产情绪非常高，都在想着各式各样的增加生产的方法，想着美好的将来。
    七月七日的下午，西北角的上空忽然黑了起来，密云衔雨，雷声不断。这个村和附近各村的老乡们，都想在下雨以前栽上山药。栽山药的人遍地都是。但没有想到，狂风一卷，几十年来空前未有的大雹灾来临了。雹子大的像铁壶，小的也有红枣那样大。大冰雹砸穿房顶，把屋里的铜瓢都砸破了。风也大得怕人。有个十七岁的姑娘，扛了锨去栽山药，走到半路，连锨带人被卷了七里路。还有一辆马车，也连人带马刮了四里路。
    人们一定会想像到当时的情景：在地里栽山药的人们跑不及了，很多人被砸倒了，受了伤。就在这个时候，驻在当地解放军的全体医务工作者急速地集中起来，几十个医生和几百个非医务人员，在团部宣誓：“我们是人民的军队，我们要保卫人民，要拿出作战的精神来抢救老乡，不怕牺牲自己……”迎着风雹，几百个人民解放军人员忘我地开始抢救受伤的农民，把受伤的人陆续抬回村去，紧急救治。这时，有的解放军同志也被雹子砸伤了。受伤的老乡们忘记了自己的疼痛，大声喊道：“同志们快回去吧！顾你们比顾我们要紧！”同志们好像没有听见，揩去自己头上的鲜血，又继续抢救老乡。有一位三十多岁的妇女被砸破了头，一个同志去抢救她，她说：“同志，快回去吧！你也砸伤了！”这位同志硬把她背起，可是没走几步，两人一齐牺牲了！
    在和这场大风雹的搏斗中，解放军同志们用他们的鲜血和生命救活了五百多位老乡，他们自己有两位同志牺牲，十多位同志负伤。
    昨天还是绿油油的庄稼，现在一下完了！农民们的情绪骤然低落下来。好多丰产户都抱头大哭。
    解放军的同志们看到这种情形，决心帮助老乡们克服困难，于是发起了救灾捐献运动。战士们都把自己抽烟的钱挤出来，一万一万地捐助给农民。只一天的工夫，就捐献了一千多万元。全团又停课三天，帮助老乡抢种。同志们的这种精神，深深地感动了农民。农民们觉得悲观没有道理，而且对不起解放军的同志，于是决心战胜灾害。全县人民在解放军的援助下，一齐动起来了。各机关团体也展开了救灾捐献运动；非灾村的群众自动组织了牲口插犋，连夜赶到重灾村帮助抢种。农民李国堂把自己的两担谷种送到村人民政府，让老乡们播种。有两个妇女背着自己的谷种走了几十里路，送到区人民政府供给受灾村人民使用。
    抢种开始了。解放军同志和男女农民们一起，拉耧、扶耩，紧张地工作。田野里又听见了农民的歌声和笑声。三四天以后，全县的播种工作全部完成了。全县人民的心安定了下来。他们说：“没有解放军同志们的帮助，我们可不能抢种得这样快。只有毛主席的领导，才能使军民团结得这样好，才能战胜这样大的困难。”农民们找领导机关，找县里下乡的干部，要求开会追悼牺牲的两位解放军同志。全县农民自动给解放军送了数十面锦旗，上面题着：“爱民模范”、“军民一家”、“人民英雄”的大字。
    过了一个时期，“大地回春”了：被砸毁的树木又抽出了嫩芽，抢种的庄稼的小苗又茁壮地生长起来。农民们高声地歌唱着：“有解放军的有力支援，我们战胜了自然灾难；我们要更团结，更努力，还要继续争取丰产……。”
