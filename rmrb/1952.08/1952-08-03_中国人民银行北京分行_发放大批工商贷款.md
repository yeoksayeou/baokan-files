    People's Bank of China Beijing Branch
    Issues Large Number of Industrial and Commercial Loans
    The People's Bank of China Beijing Branch has issued a large number of industrial and commercial loans, promoting the recovery and revitalization of the market. After the "Five-Anti" campaign, the People's Bank of Beijing adopted measures such as simplifying procedures, expanding loans, and reducing profit margins to support the recovery and development of private industry and commerce. By the end of June, the loan balance had reached 84.5 billion yuan, an increase of 1.42 times compared to the same period last year, and the number of industrial and commercial borrowers reached 9,522, an increase of 2.48 times compared to the same period last year. After receiving loans from the People's Bank, private industrial and commercial enterprises have restored and expanded production and business. For example, the private Nanyang Chemical Factory's production was once suspended, but after receiving a loan of 50 million yuan, production was fully restored. Currently, in addition to accepting an order for 1,000 boxes of soap from the Beijing Department Store, it has also accepted orders for more than 120 tons of cottonseed oil soap from cooperatives in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shijiazhuang and other places. After receiving a loan, the private Fuxing Flour Mill purchased 1.6 million jin of wheat from Henan Province, and its monthly output increased from 50,000 bags to 150,000 bags. After being assisted by the People's Bank, the private Chuqi Paper Mill increased its equipment and changed its production to Xuelian paper and office paper, with daily output increasing from 57 reams to 117 reams. The daily output has now reached 130 reams, an increase of 2.28 times compared to before the "Five-Anti" campaign. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国人民银行北京分行
    发放大批工商贷款
    中国人民银行北京分行发放大批工商贷款，促进了市场的恢复和活跃。“五反”运动后，北京人民银行曾采取简化手续、扩大贷款以及降低利润率等措施扶助私营工商业的恢复和发展。至六月底贷款余额已达八百四十五亿元，比去年同期增加了一点四二倍，贷款工商户达九千五百二十二户，比去年同期增加二点四八倍。私营工商户得到人民银行贷款后，均恢复与扩大了生产和业务。如私营南洋化学工厂生产曾一度停顿，在得到贷款五千万元后生产全部恢复。目前除接受北京市百货公司一千箱肥皂订货外，并接受了河北、平原、石家庄等地合作社一百二十余吨棉油皂的订货。私营福兴面粉厂在贷款后，到河南省采购小麦一百六十万斤，每月产量由五万袋增至十五万袋。私营初起造纸厂经人民银行扶助后，增加设备改产雪连纸和办公纸，每日产量由五十七令增加到一百十七令，现在每日产量已达一百三十令，比“五反”运动前增加了二点二八倍。（新华社）
