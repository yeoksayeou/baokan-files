We once again assure you: we will call on the sisters of the whole country to regard you as their own relatives; to better assist the government in doing a good job in preferential treatment, to do a good job in farming on behalf of the families in the countryside, and to further help you participate in production and introduce occupations in the cities, so that your lives can be further improved; at the same time, we also hope that you can more actively participate in labor production and social activities, study politics hard, improve your culture and skills, and strive to emerge more model figures in the selection of model martyrs and military families after the autumn of this year! Best wishes for your health.
