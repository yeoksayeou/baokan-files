    Strive to Study the Basic Theories of Revolution
    Editor's Note: Comrade Cao Zengzhi's determination and plan to study theory are very good. It is hoped that the majority of people's teachers can carry forward this spirit of self-study and improve their theoretical level.
    Comrade Editor: I was extremely excited after reading the article "We Must Systematically Study the Basic Knowledge of Marxism-Leninism" published in the "Party Life" column of the People's Daily on July 2nd. This not only made me realize the importance of studying the basic theories of revolution, but also gave me some enlightenment on learning methods and attitudes. Then I read "Georgi Dimitrov - An Outstanding Activist of the International Workers' Movement" and Comrade Wu Yuzhang's "People's Teachers Must Study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought." This further made me realize the importance of intellectuals systematically studying the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, which is a necessary condition for doing a good job and the key to determining whether an individual can make progress.
    In order to respond to this extremely important call of the People's Daily, strive to create conditions, and strive to be a people's teacher, I have decided to squeeze out as much time as possible within two years to read the following books: Elementary Political Common Sense, Lectures on Basic Knowledge of Social Sciences, Modern History of China, Political Economy, History of the Communist Party of China, Selected Works of Mao Zedong, and Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, etc. As for the method of study, I plan to read each book roughly first, and then read it carefully. When reading roughly, I will write marginal notes on the book, and after reading carefully, I will write a study summary. If the impression is not deep, I will read it again carefully. During the reading process, if there are any questions I don't understand, I will write them down at any time, and after finishing reading, I will sort them out separately and ask the relevant departments for guidance. Every year on "July 1st," I will conscientiously check my learning experiences and lessons learned over the past year, formulate methods for correction, and set a learning plan for the second year.

### 努力学习革命基本理论

    努力学习革命基本理论
    编者按：曹增之同志学习理论的决心和计划是很好的。希望广大人民教师都能发扬这种自学精神，提高自己的理论水平。
    编辑同志：人民日报七月二日“党的生活”栏发表的“必须系统地学习马克思列宁主义的基本知识”一文，我阅读后，感到极大兴奋。这不仅使我认识了学习革命基本理论的重要性，而且对学习方法与态度上，也得到了一些启发。接着又读了“乔治·季米特洛夫——国际工人运动的杰出的活动家”和吴玉章同志的“人民教师必须学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想”两文。使我更进一步认识到知识分子进行系统地学习马克思列宁主义基本理论的重要，它是做好工作的必要条件，也是决定个人能否进步的关键。
    为了响应人民日报这一极重要的号召，努力创造条件，争取做人民教师，决定在两年内，尽量挤出时间，阅读下列各书：初级政治常识、社会科学基本知识讲座、中国近代史、政治经济学、中国共产党党史、毛泽东选集和辩证唯物论与历史唯物论等。学习的方法，我计划各书均先粗读一遍，然后精读。粗读时在书端上写眉批，精读后写学习总结，如印象不深刻，再认真阅读一遍。在阅读过程中，遇有不懂的问题，随时笔记下来，等到读完后，分别加以整理，向有关部门请求指导。每年规定“七一”认真检查一年来学习心得与经验教训，制订改正方法，并订好第二年的学习计划。
    曹增之
