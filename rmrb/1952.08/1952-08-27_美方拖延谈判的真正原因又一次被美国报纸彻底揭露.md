Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 26th: The American aggressors have consistently propagated that their unwillingness to achieve a swift armistice stems from "humanitarian" considerations for the so-called "refusal to repatriate" prisoners of war. These long-bankrupt lies have now been exposed once again by American newspapers.

    American columnist Stone pointed out the real reason for the U.S. government's delay in the Korean armistice negotiations in the "Compass Daily" on July 18th. He stated that the Korean War has "become a political necessity for American foreign policy." He further said: "If a truce is reached in Korea, international tensions will ease, hopes for a broader solution to problems will revive, and at the same time, maintaining the speed of rearmament in Western Europe and implementing the rearmament of West Germany will be more difficult than ever before."

    The slowing down of the arms race that would result from a Korean armistice would be a fatal blow to the American monopoly capitalists who are making a fortune from the war. American columnist Porter wrote in the "New York Post" on July 22nd that the Korean armistice might bring the United States "decreased consumption, decreased employment, decreased production, and decreased profits." She pointed out that the aggression that the United States is currently carrying out is the "pillar beneath the prosperity" of the United States today. The huge "defense" expenditures paid for aggression have enabled the United States to "jump from one boom to another." A Korean armistice would mean a reduction in "defense" expenditures, and a reduction in "defense" expenditures would lead to economic depression. She quoted a "nationally admired economist" in the United States as saying: "We are heading for an economic depression within the next few years anyway. We cannot avoid it. Cutting defense spending now will only accelerate its arrival. ... Without huge defense spending, we would already be in an economic panic. When that expense is reduced, we will go downhill—and quickly."

    This is the real reason why the American aggressors need to delay and even sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations. They are attempting to use the corpses of tens of thousands of American, British, and Canadian youths to block the wheels of their downward spiral. The dirty dollar, soaked in blood, is the symbol of the so-called "humanitarianism" in the mouths of the American aggressors.

### 美方拖延谈判的真正原因又一次被美国报纸彻底揭露

    美方拖延谈判的真正原因又一次被美国报纸彻底揭露
    【新华社开城二十六日电】美国侵略者一直宣传他们之所以不愿使停战迅速实现，是出于对于所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘的“人道主义”的考虑。这些早就破产了的鬼话现在又一次被美国的报纸揭穿了。
    美国的专栏作家史东在七月十八日的“指南针日报”上指出了美国政府拖延朝鲜停战谈判的真正原因。他说，朝鲜战争已经“成为美国外交政策的一个政治必需品”了。他又说：“如果在朝鲜达成休战，国际紧张局势即将缓和，对于较广泛地解决问题的希望即将复起，同时，保持西欧重整军备的速度与贯彻西德的重新武装这两件事，将较以前任何时候更为困难。”
    朝鲜停战所将引起的军备竞赛速度的减低，对于正在大发战争财的美国垄断资本家来说，将是致命的打击。美国专栏女作家波特在七月二十二日的“纽约邮报”上著文说：朝鲜停战可能给美国带来的东西是“消费递减，就业递减，生产递减，利润递减”。她指出，美国现在所进行的侵略是美国今天的“繁荣下面的支柱”。为了进行侵略而支付的巨额“国防”费用曾经使美国“从一次繁荣跳到另一次繁荣”。朝鲜停战将意味着缩减“国防”费用，而缩减“国防”费用将引致经济萧条。她引用美国的一个“全国推崇的经济学家”的话说：“我们无论如何正在走向此后几年之内的一个经济萧条。我们无法避免。现在缩减国防费用，只会使它加速到来。……要是没有巨大的国防费用，我们现在已经陷入经济恐慌了。当这项费用减少的时候，我们就会走下坡路——而且走得很快。”
    这就是美国侵略者需要拖延以至破坏朝鲜停战谈判的真正原因。他们企图用成千成万美国、英国、加拿大青年的尸体来挡住他们的往下坡路走的车轮。浸透了鲜血的肮脏的美元，就是美国侵略者口中的所谓“人道主义”的象征。
