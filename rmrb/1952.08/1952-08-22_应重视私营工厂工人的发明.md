    Attention Should Be Paid to the Inventions of Workers in Private Factories
    Editor: I suggest that trade union organizations in various regions should pay attention to the inventions and creations of workers in private factories.
    When the Taiyuan Private Republic Iron Factory was processing 10,000 "well hook bottle handles" for the Shanxi Branch of the China Industrial Equipment Company, Zhao Yushu, a worker at the factory, believed that it would be difficult to complete this batch of processing tasks on time based on the existing technical level and equipment. Therefore, after two days and two nights of painstaking research, he created a "curved arm hand-operated machine." After successful testing, production efficiency increased fourfold, and the product quality was also 100% up to standard. This batch of processing work alone increased the factory's income by more than two million yuan, greatly increasing the factory owner's confidence in production. Fu Xiushan, a 19-year-old apprentice at the private Jin Yi Iron Factory, was working on a drilling machine. This drilling machine could only drill screw caps into smooth holes, and then manually make spiral holes, which was both laborious and slow. Based on the Soviet drilling machine installation method (he had a book introducing advanced Soviet tools), after two months of research, he transformed the drilling machine into a "spiral cap machine," which completely mechanized the production of screw caps. After preliminary testing, production efficiency increased threefold. He also created a "hooking machine" (a tool for making waterwheel chains), which was four times more efficient than using a hammer before. After they created these production tools, many workers in public and private iron factories in the city went to visit. Some factories immediately drew drawings and re-equipped their machines.
    Based on the above situation, I suggest that trade union organizations at all levels, especially district trade union offices, should pay attention to mobilizing workers in private factories to tap potential and find tricks. More importantly, when they discover that workers in private factories have made improvements and creations in production, trade union organizations should take effective methods to convene city-wide or district-wide worker mass meetings to give encouragement. It is useless for the factory owner to give out tens of thousands of yuan in bonuses in their own small factory. It is very wrong that the Taiyuan City First and Second District Trade Union Offices did not pay attention to these improvements and creations of workers in a timely manner.

### 应重视私营工厂工人的发明

    应重视私营工厂工人的发明
    编辑同志：我建议各地工会组织应重视私营工厂工人的发明创造。
    太原私营共和铁工厂为中国工业器材公司山西省分公司加工一万个“工井抅瓶把”时，该厂工人赵玉树认为根据现有技术水平和设备，按时完成这批加工任务是困难的。于是他经过两天两夜的苦心研究，创造了一个“曲湾手搬机”，经试验成功，生产效率提高了四倍，产品质量也百分之百的合乎标准。只这一批加工活，就给该厂增加了二百多万元收入，大大提高了该厂资方的生产信心。私营晋义铁工厂十九岁的徒工傅秀山，在钻床上做活。这部钻床机，只能把螺丝帽钻成光眼，然后再用人工制成螺旋眼，这样做既费力出活又慢，他就根据苏联钻床装置的方法（他有一本介绍苏联先进工具的书），经过了两个月的研究，将钻床改为“过螺旋帽机”，使螺丝帽生产完全使用机器，经初步试验，生产效率提高三倍。他还创造了一种“搬抅机”（造水车链子的工具），比以前用铁锤打，效率提高了四倍。他们创造出这些生产工具后，全市不少公、私营铁厂的工人都去参观，有的厂并立即绘了图，重新改装自己的机器。
    根据以上情况，我建议各级工会组织，特别是区工会办事处，应注意发动私营工厂工人挖潜力、找窍门，更重要的是当发现了私营工厂工人在生产上有所改进和创造时，工会组织应采取有效方法，召开全市或者全区性的工人群众大会，给予鼓励。只是在自己的小厂子里，资方发给几万元奖，那是不起作用的。太原市一、二区工会办事处没有及时重视工人这些改进和创造是十分不对的。
