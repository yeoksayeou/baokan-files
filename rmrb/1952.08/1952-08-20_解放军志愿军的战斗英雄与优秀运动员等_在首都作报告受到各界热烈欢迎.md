Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The sports meet held by the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, organized combat heroes, excellent athletes, and literary and artistic workers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers attending the meeting to give reports to more than 133,000 people from various organizations, groups, schools, and citizens in the capital from the 12th to thank the people of the capital for their love and help. This came to a temporary end on the 18th.

Participating in this reporting activity were Zhang Jihui, Zhao Baotong, and Liu Yuti, air force heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers, whom the people of the capital had long awaited; Qi Jianhua, the creator of the "Quick Literacy Method"; Gao Yubao, a famous literary and artistic fighter; Wu Yuanjin, the first place winner in the long jump at the conference and winner of the Huadong Third-Class People's Hero Medal; female aviator Ruan Hezhen, female parachutist Shen Yuanzhen, composer Shi Lemeng of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and excellent literary and artistic workers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, among others.

This report introduced to the people of the capital the excellent achievements of our people's army in cultural learning, sports and art activities, and military technology. The revolutionary heroism and brilliant achievements of our people's army in the struggle to defend the motherland and defend peace were deeply praised by people from all walks of life in the capital. Wherever the reporters went, the venue immediately erupted. People lifted them high, vying to shake their hands, asking them for autographs, offering them flowers and red scarves, and writing them letters... The entire class of the Sixth Squad of the First District Cleaning Brigade wrote a letter to Qi Jianhua saying: "Our entire class participated in the 'Quick Literacy Method' study. After 42 hours of study, those who previously did not know a single character now recognize 1,600 to 2,100 characters. This is all because you created a good literacy method for us. Four months ago, we were still illiterate, but now we can read general popular books and newspapers. We wish you good health forever..."

The heroes' reports were a great inspiration and vivid education to the people of the capital. After listening to the reports of the air force heroes, people had a clearer understanding of the growth and strength of our volunteer air force and the noble qualities of our soldiers. Many workers became more enthusiastic about production after listening to the reports. When the heroes reported at the Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace, they received more than 40 letters on the spot from construction workers, trolley workers, and workers from factories in various countries. They all expressed: Thank you to the heroes for protecting them in their production and construction, and they are determined to work hard in production and improve work efficiency. They will support the Chinese People's Volunteers with new creations and new records. After listening to the reports, students from large, medium, and small schools all expressed that they would study hard, exercise, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the posts where the motherland needs them most to build and defend the motherland. The broad masses of citizens also expressed that they would step up production and do a good job in the patriotic health campaign and support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers. Liu Guangren, an old man in the Second District who made a living selling tofu, stopped selling tofu after hearing the news that the heroes of the Volunteers were coming to give reports. He bought flowers and personally presented them to Liu Yuti, a hero of the Volunteer Air Force, and said to him: "I will do everything in my power to support you. As long as we resist America and aid Korea, I can contribute everything."

The boundless love of the people of the capital for the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers also deeply educated and inspired the heroic models. Liu Yuti recalled the love of the people of the capital for him and said: "An old lady in her seventies offered me flowers. She held my hand tightly, tears streaming down her face, and said like she was talking to a child who had been away for many years: 'You are fighting victoriously in the front, protecting all of us. We are very touched when we think of your hard work.' The people of the motherland love us so much. I must repay the care of the people of the motherland with even more severe blows against the American aerial bandits." Comrade Zhang Jihui said: "The love and care of the people of the motherland for us really makes me wonder how to express it. The achievements we have obtained are the result of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation of us, and the education and help of leaders and comrades. But my contribution to the Party and the people is still very small. I will work harder in the future and shoot down more American planes." Zhang Jihui, Zhao Baotong and others are all determined to learn from the Soviet Air Force hero Kozhedub and create more and greater victories to answer the love of the people of the motherland. Yan Changshuo, the first place winner in the high jump at the conference, said: "In the competition at the conference, my high jump result broke the national record after liberation with 1.76 meters, but with the encouragement of the people, I practiced harder, and yesterday I jumped over 1.78 meters in the performance. I will never let down the expectations of the people, study hard, and move forward forever." Everyone unanimously expressed: We must bring the spirit of the "August 1st" sports meet and the love of the people of the capital to the entire army and the front lines of Korea, better defend the motherland and defend peace, and respond to the love of the people of the capital.

    解放军志愿军的战斗英雄与优秀运动员等
    在首都作报告受到各界热烈欢迎
    【新华社十九日讯】中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会，为答谢首都人民的热爱和帮助，自十二日起组织与会的中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军战斗英雄、优秀运动员和文艺工作者向首都各机关、团体、学校、市民等十三万三千余人作了报告，至十八日告一段落。
    参加这次报告活动的有首都人民久所盼望的中国人民志愿军空军英雄张积慧、赵宝桐、刘玉堤；有“速成识字法”创造者祁建华；有著名的文艺战士高玉宝；有华东三级人民英雄奖章获得者大会跳远第一名吴愿金；有女航空员阮荷珍、女跳伞员沈元珍，中国人民解放军作曲家时乐濛及中国人民志愿军优秀的文艺工作者等人。
    这次报告向首都人民介绍了我国人民军队在文化学习、体育文艺活动和军事技术上的优良成绩。我国人民军队在为保卫祖国、保卫和平斗争中的革命英雄主义和辉煌成就，深受首都各界人民的赞扬。报告的人走进那个会场，那里便立刻沸腾起来。人们把他们高高抬起，争着向他们握手，要他们签名，向他们献花、献红领巾，给他们写信……。第一区清洁大队六分班全班写信给祁建华说：“我们全班参加了‘速成识字法’学习，经过四十二小时的学习，从前一个字不识的现在也认识了一千六百字到二千一百字。这都是你给我们创造了好的识字法。在四个月以前我们还是睁眼瞎子，现在能读一般的通俗书报了。祝你身体永远健康……。”
    英雄们的报告对首都人民是极大的鼓舞和生动的教育。人们听了空军英雄们的报告，更清楚地知道了我国志愿空军的力量成长壮大和我军战士的崇高品质。许多工人们听了报告之后，更加提高了生产热情。英雄们在北京劳动人民文化宫报告时，当场就收到修建工人、电车工人和各国营工厂工人四十余封信。他们一致表示：感谢英雄们保卫着他们进行生产建设，并决心努力生产，提高工作效率。要以新的创造、新的纪录来支援中国人民志愿军。各大、中、小学的学生听了报告之后，都表示要努力学习，锻炼身体，随时准备响应祖国的召唤，为建设祖国、保卫祖国，到祖国最需要的岗位上去。广大市民也表示要加紧生产，作好爱国卫生运动和拥军优属工作。二区以卖豆腐维持生活的刘广仁老汉，听到志愿军英雄来做报告的消息后，豆腐也不卖了，买了鲜花亲自献给志愿空军英雄刘玉堤，并对他说：“我要尽一切力量来支援你们。只要抗美援朝，我什么都可以贡献出来。”
    首都人民对中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军的无比热爱，也深深地教育和鼓舞了英雄模范们。刘玉堤回忆首都人民对他的热爱时说：“有一位七十多岁的老太太向我献花，她紧握着我的手，眼里流出了眼泪，像对她离开多年的孩子一样说：‘你们在前方打胜仗，保卫我们大家，我们想到你们辛苦，我们就很感动。’祖国人民对我们太热爱了。我一定要以对美国空中强盗更严重的打击，来报答祖国人民对我们的关怀。”张积慧同志说：“祖国人民对我们的热爱和关怀真使我不知怎样才能表达出来。我们所得到的成绩，是共产党、毛主席对我们的培养、上级和同志们对我们的教育和帮助的结果。但我对党对人民的贡献还很少，我今后还要更加努力，多多打下美国飞机。”张积慧、赵宝桐等都决心向苏联空军英雄阔日杜布学习，创造更多更大的胜利来回答祖国人民的热爱。大会跳高第一名颜昌硕说：“大会比赛，我的跳高成绩以一点七六公尺，突破解放后全国纪录，但在人民鼓舞下，我又加紧练习，昨天表演时我又跳过了一点七八公尺。我决不辜负人民的热望，努力学习，永远前进。”大家一致表示：要把“八一”运动大会的精神和首都人民的热爱带到全军和朝鲜前线去，更好地保卫祖国、保卫和平，来回答首都人民的热爱。
