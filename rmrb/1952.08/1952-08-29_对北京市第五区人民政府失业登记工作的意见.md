    Opinions on Unemployment Registration Work of the Fifth District People's Government of Beijing Municipality
    Editor: The article "The Fifth District People's Government of Beijing Municipality Should Not Refuse Unemployment Registration for Poor Laboring Women" published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on August 17th has aroused the attention of us who have a low level of education. I am someone who recently graduated from an adult night school (equivalent to junior high school level) and is participating in the work of educating out-of-school children. I often feel that in the great leap forward construction of the motherland, I hate that my labor power is not enough, and that I contribute too little to the motherland. Therefore, when I saw Comrade Cheng Guilan voluntarily requesting work with her labor power, I was very moved. I believe that Comrade Cheng Guilan's request is worthy of our welcome. Our country's movement to eliminate illiteracy has just begun, and it is problematic to immediately require people with a junior high school graduation level or above to be able to participate in work. According to Comrade Cheng Guilan's reflection, the attitude of the female comrade in the Fifth District People's Government of Beijing Municipality who is responsible for unemployment registration work is wrong, and I ask her to examine herself.

    对北京市第五区人民政府失业登记工作的意见
    编辑同志：八月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的“北京市第五区人民政府不应拒绝贫苦劳动妇女失业登记”一文，引起我们文化程度低的人的重视。我是一个不久前在成人夜校毕业（相当于高小程度）参加教育失学儿童工作的。我时常感到，在祖国飞跃的伟大建设中，恨自己劳动力不够，贡献给祖国的东西太少。所以当看到程桂兰同志自愿用劳动力请求工作时，使我很受感动。我认为，程桂兰同志的请求，是值得我们欢迎的。我们祖国的扫除文盲运动还刚开始，马上就要求有高小毕业以上程度的人才能参加工作，这是有问题的。根据程桂兰同志的反映，北京市第五区人民政府那位负责失业登记工作的女同志对待劳动人民的态度是错误的，请她检讨一下。　北京北池子四十七号　刘　方
