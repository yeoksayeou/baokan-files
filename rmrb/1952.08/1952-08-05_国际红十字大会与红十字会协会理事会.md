    International Red Cross Conference and League of Red Cross Societies Board of Governors

    The 18th International Red Cross Conference opened in Toronto, Canada on July 26. Delegations from approximately seventy countries, representing both governments and Red Cross societies, are participating in the conference, scheduled to conclude on August 7. Concurrently, the League of Red Cross Societies is holding its 22nd Board of Governors meeting in Toronto. The Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries have sent delegations to attend the conference.

    What is the International Red Cross Conference? According to the International Red Cross Statute and the conference's rules of procedure, the members participating in the conference are the Red Cross societies of various countries, the League of Red Cross Societies, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and representatives of governments that have signed the Geneva Conventions. It is a conference attended by all different systems of Red Cross organizations worldwide. The task of the conference is to "decide on the policy of the Red Cross and to study and revise the Red Cross statutes."

    The first session of the International Red Cross Conference was held in Paris, France, in 1867. Initially, the conference was convened every two to three years. Later, it was changed to every four years. During World War II, the conference was suspended for ten years until the 17th International Red Cross Conference was convened in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1948. Under the influence of the powerful forces of people worldwide urgently demanding peace, that session of the conference adopted resolutions on "banning the indiscriminate use of projectile weapons," "preventing the sabotage of humanitarian conventions," and "the Red Cross and peace."

    The procedure of the conference usually begins with the plenary session electing the officials of the current conference (including the chairman, vice-chairman, secretary-general, and deputy secretary-general), adopting the conference agenda, and referring all issues on the agenda to the committees designated by the plenary session (this session has a General Affairs Committee, a Relief Committee, a Health Care and Social Assistance Committee, a Youth Committee, and a Drafting Committee) for study and discussion, and finally formulating draft resolutions for submission to the plenary session for adoption. Among the committees, the General Affairs Committee discusses the most topics, and the most important ones.

    The executive body during the intersessional period of the International Red Cross Conference is the Standing Commission. The Standing Commission is composed of five persons elected by the conference, two representatives of the League of Red Cross Societies, and two representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The current chairman of the Standing Commission is François-Poncet (France). In addition to the representatives of the League of Red Cross Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross, the members include representatives of the Red Cross societies of the United Kingdom, Sweden, Brazil, and Turkey. The main functions of the Standing Commission, in addition to arbitrating disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the International Red Cross Statute (subject to the final decision of the conference), coordinating the work and disputes between the International Committee of the Red Cross and the League of Red Cross Societies during the intersessional period, also include preparing the provisional agenda and agenda and other matters for the conference jointly with the host country's Red Cross society, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the League of Red Cross Societies before the opening of each conference. Under the behind-the-scenes manipulation of the United States, the current Standing Commission has violated the International Red Cross Statute and organizational principles, infringed on the rights of the Chinese people, and decided to invite representatives of the Kuomintang remnants to attend the meeting.

    What is the League of Red Cross Societies? The League of Red Cross Societies is a joint organization of the Red Cross societies of various countries, established in 1919, with its headquarters in Geneva. Currently, Red Cross societies from seventy-one countries have joined the League. The highest authority of the League is the Board of Governors, composed of one representative appointed by each national Red Cross society, which meets every two years. The chairman of the 21st Board of Governors (1950-1952) was Sandström, the president of the Swedish Red Cross, and the representative of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union was one of the vice-chairmen. The executive body during the recess of the Board of Governors is the Executive Committee. In addition to the chairman and vice-chairman of the Board of Governors serving as the ex officio chairman and vice-chairman of the Executive Committee, there are twelve executive members, and the Red Cross Society of China is one of the executive members. At the various meetings of the 21st Board of Governors and Executive Committee, the delegations of the Red Cross societies of China and the Soviet Union proposed important resolutions related to safeguarding humanitarianism, such as condemning the U.S. aggression against Korea and calling for participation in the signature campaign for the Five-Power Peace Pact. However, the United States manipulated the majority to obstruct these resolutions, preventing them from being passed. However, the delegations of the Soviet Union and China also prompted the meeting to pass resolutions on banning atomic bombs and other lethal weapons and providing relief for the Indian famine.

    What kind of organization is the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross? It is not an international organization at all. The honorary president of the committee, Huber, admitted in a book he wrote: "The committee is not a social institution established under international law, but at most a simple group organized by twenty-five Swiss citizens." The committee also admitted in a booklet it published: The committee is only "a private group operating under Swiss law." Moreover, the existing nineteen members of the committee are mainly large capitalists, large manufacturers, and large bankers who have close ties with foreign capital. For example, Huber is a director and administrative director of Aluminum Industry Corporation and many other corporations and insurance companies. The chairman of the committee, Ruegger, is the administrative director of one of Switzerland's largest insurance companies. During World War II, the U.S. and British ruling groups repeatedly colluded with Hitler, attempting to unite against the Soviet Union. The intermediary for this activity was Burkhalter, an important member of the Red Cross "International" Committee. At the same time, the committee also covered up the crimes of the Hitler gang in mass slaughtering Slavic prisoners of war (primarily Soviet prisoners of war).

    The so-called International Committee of the Red Cross mainly relies on funds from the United States and Britain for its activities. From January to September 1951, nearly three-quarters of all the "voluntary" donations received by the committee came from the U.S.-British bloc, and the vast majority came from the United States. Therefore, it is no accident that the U.S. aggressors used the International Committee of the Red Cross to cover up various crimes during the Korean War.

    The so-called International Committee of the Red Cross should have been an institution in an equal position with other national Red Cross societies. However, it considers itself the earliest established "Red Cross" organization and claims to be the main drafter of the Geneva Conventions. The International Red Cross Statute grants it absurd rights, such as recognizing the Red Cross organizations of various countries and handling matters related to violations of the Geneva Conventions. The International Red Cross Statute also expressly stipulates that it can send two representatives to participate in the International Red Cross Standing Commission. According to general "tradition" and "practice," the chairman of the committee is always elected as the chairman of the provisional committee of the International Red Cross Conference (i.e., the conference preparatory meeting).

    Many facts prove that the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross, which often flaunts "neutrality" and "humanity," is now merely a tool used by U.S. imperialism at will.

    It is known that the basic task of the international Red Cross movement is to uphold humanitarian principles. Therefore, this International Red Cross Conference should become a conference to condemn the U.S. interventionist forces for massacring Korean peaceful residents, conducting inhuman bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people, and torturing and killing Chinese and Korean prisoners of war. It is precisely for this reason that the U.S. government, which is full of crimes, and its accomplice, the British government, are extremely panicked. They dare not send official delegations to participate in the conference, but send so-called "observer delegations" to Toronto to direct their servants behind the scenes to carry out various destructive conspiracies. They are using the guise of "not discussing politics" at the conference to prevent the conference from discussing the major issues related to safeguarding humanitarianism, namely, the various atrocities committed by the United States in Korea in violation of international law and humanitarian principles, in order to escape the condemnation of world opinion. At the same time, they are also conspiring to sabotage the conference. Under the manipulation of the United States, the conference passed a resolution allowing representatives of the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan to attend the meeting, thereby seriously undermining the International Red Cross Statute and the organizational principles of the conference. However, the various crimes of the U.S. aggressors in Korea are irrefutable and cannot be covered up in any way. In order to uphold the Geneva Conventions and the dignity of the international Red Cross movement, this conference should undoubtedly pass a resolution condemning the various crimes constantly committed by the U.S. aggressors in Korea and demand that these crimes be stopped.

### 国际红十字大会与红十字会协会理事会

    国际红十字大会与红十字会协会理事会
    第十八届国际红十字大会已于七月二十六日在加拿大多伦多开幕。参加大会的约有七十个国家的政府和红十字会的代表团。大会预定在八月七日闭幕。与此同时，红十字会协会也在多伦多举行第二十二届理事会。苏联、中国以及各人民民主国家的政府和红十字会都派遣了代表团出席大会。
    什么是国际红十字大会呢？依据国际红十字章程和大会细则的规定，参加大会的成员为各国的红十字会、红十字会协会、红十字国际委员会和日内瓦公约签字国政府的代表。这是全世界所有不同系统的红十字组织参加的会议。大会的任务是“决定红十字会的政策，研究与修改红十字规约”。
    国际红十字大会第一届会议于一八六七年在法国巴黎召开。最初每隔二、三年召开大会一次。以后，改为每四年举行一次。第二次世界大战期间，大会曾停顿十年，直至一九四八年才在瑞典斯德哥尔摩召开了第十七届国际红十字大会。在全世界人民迫切要求和平的强大力量的影响下，该届大会曾通过了关于“禁用盲目投射武器”、“制止破坏人道主义公约”及“红十字与和平”等决议。
    大会进行的程序，通常是先由大会全体会议选出本届大会负责人（包括大会主席、副主席、正副秘书长等），通过大会议程，并将所有列入议程的问题交由全体大会所指定的各委员会（本届大会有总务委员会、救济委员会、保健护理及社会救助委员会、青少年委员会、起草委员会）进行研究和讨论，最后制定议案提请大会全体会议通过。各委员会中以总务委员会讨论的议题较多，较重要。
    国际红十字大会闭会期间的执行机构是常设委员会。常设委员会由大会选举五人、红十字会协会代表二人、红十字国际委员会代表二人组成。现任常设委员会主席为法朗索阿—庞赛（法国），委员除红十字会协会、红十字国际委员会的代表外，尚有英国、瑞典、巴西、土耳其红十字会的代表。常设委员会的主要职权，除平时仲裁关于国际红十字章程的解释与应用中所发生的分歧意见（受大会最后决定之限制）、大会闭会期间调整与协调红十字国际委员会和红十字会协会的工作和分歧意见外，在每届大会开幕前，并与大会所在地国家红十字会、红十字国际委员会及红十字会协会共同准备大会临时日程和议程以及其他事项。本届常设委员会在美国的幕后操纵下，竟违背国际红十字章程和组织原则，侵犯中国人民的权利，决定邀请国民党残余匪帮代表出席会议。
    什么是红十字会协会呢？红十字会协会是各国红十字会的联合组织，于一九一九年成立，会址设在日内瓦，现在有七十一个国家的红十字会参加了协会。协会最高权力机关是理事会，由各国红十字会指派代表一人组成，每隔二年开会一次。第二十一届理事会（一九五零—一九五二年）主席是瑞典红十字会会长桑兹特朗，苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会代表为副主席之一。理事会休会期间的执行机构是执行委员会。除理事会主席和副主席为执行委员会当然主席和副主席外，尚有十二个执行委员，我国红十字会即为执行委员之一。在二十一届理事会和执行委员会的历次会议上，我国和苏联红十字会代表团曾提出谴责美国侵朝暴行以及号召参加要求缔结五大国和平公约签名运动等有关维护人道主义的重要议案，而美国操纵多数，加以阻挠，竟使之未获通过。但是苏、中等代表团也促使会议不得不通过了禁用原子弹和其他杀人武器以及救济印度灾荒等议案。
    所谓红十字国际委员会，是怎样的一种组织呢？它根本不是什么国际组织。该委员会的名誉主席胡伯在他写的一本书里也承认：“委员会不是一个根据国际法建立的社会机构，而是至多不过二十五名瑞士公民所组织的一个简单团体。”该委员会在它出版的一个小册子里也承认：委员会只是“按照瑞士法律进行活动的一个私人团体”。不仅如此，该委员会现有的十九个委员，主要都是与外国资本有密切关系的大资本家、大制造商与大银行家。例如胡伯就是制铝工业股份公司、及其他许多股份公司和保险公司的董事和行政理事。这个委员会的主席吕格是瑞士某最大保险公司的行政理事。第二次世界大战期间，美英统治集团一再与希特勒勾搭，企图联合起来反对苏联。进行这种活动的中间人，就是红十字“国际”委员会的重要委员之一布克哈特。同时，该委员会对于希特勒匪帮大批屠杀斯拉夫民族的战俘（首先是苏联战俘）的罪行，也同样地加以掩盖。
    所谓红十字国际委员会，最近主要是靠美英的款项进行活动的。从一九五一年一月到九月，该委员会所收到的全部“乐”捐，差不多有四分之三来自美英集团，而且绝大部分来自美国。因此，美国侵略者在侵朝战争中利用红十字国际委员会来掩盖各种罪行，并不是偶然的。
    所谓红十字国际委员会，本来应该是和其他各国红十字会处于平等地位的机构。但是，它以最早成立的一个“红十字”团体自居，并自命是日内瓦公约的主要起草者。国际红十字章程赋予它荒唐的权利，例如，由它承认各国的红十字组织并处理违犯日内瓦公约的事宜。国际红十字章程并明文规定它可派代表二人参加国际红十字常设委员会。按照一般“传统”“惯例”，该委员会主席总是被推为国际红十字大会临时委员会（即大会准备会议）的主席。
    许多事实证明，这个经常以“中立”与“人道”相标榜的所谓红十字国际委员会，实际上，它现在只不过是受美帝国主义任意驱使的御用工具而已。
    人们知道：国际红十字运动的基本任务在于维护人道主义原则。因此，本届国际红十字大会应当成为谴责美国干涉军屠杀朝鲜和平居民、对朝、中人民进行灭绝人性的细菌战以及虐杀中朝战俘等滔天罪行的大会。正是由于这个原因，罪迹累累的美国政府及其帮凶英国政府都极感恐慌。他们不敢派遣正式代表团参加大会，而派遣了所谓“观察员代表团”前往多伦多，在幕后指挥他们的仆从进行各种破坏阴谋活动。他们在大会上正在用所谓“不谈政治”的幌子，来阻挠大会讨论当前有关维护人道主义的重大问题，即关于美国破坏国际法和人道原则在朝鲜犯下的种种暴行的问题，以此逃避世界舆论的指责。同时，他们还阴谋破坏大会。就在美国的操纵下，大会竟通过了让台湾国民党残余匪帮的代表出席会议的决议，从而严重地破坏了国际红十字章程和大会组织原则。然而，美国侵略者在朝鲜的各种罪行，铁证如山，是无论如何都掩盖不住的。为了维护日内瓦公约和国际红十字运动的尊严，这次大会毫无疑义地应该通过谴责美国侵略者在朝鲜不断制造出来的种种罪行，并要求制止这种罪行。
