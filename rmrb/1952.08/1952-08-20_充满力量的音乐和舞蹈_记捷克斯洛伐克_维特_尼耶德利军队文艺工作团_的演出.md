    Full of Power Music and Dance
    —Remembering the Performance of the Czechoslovak “Vít Nejedlý Army Art Ensemble”
    Zhu Shulan
    The Czechoslovak “Vít Nejedlý Army Art Ensemble,” invited to visit China, has come to Beijing during the 25th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. On the evening of the closing ceremony of the "August 1st" Sports Meeting, they met for the first time with sports and art representatives of the troops and tens of thousands of people in the capital. People warmly welcomed the guests and comrades-in-arms from the distant Eastern European brother country.
    The Vít Nejedlý Army Art Ensemble is an excellent artistic group that is combat-ready and mass-based, armed with their own national art and the advanced socialist realism art of the Soviet Union. Their outstanding musical and dance performances aroused loud, lasting applause and cheers from the Chinese audience. In the square of the Temple of Agriculture, the spotlights illuminated the stage, and the moving performances of their more than 110-member choir, more than 60-member orchestra, and more than 40-member dance team gave the audience a profound and unforgettable impression.
    The audience enthusiastically loved those powerful and wonderful programs. They felt the education of lofty patriotism and internationalism from them, and deeply understood the close friendship between China and Czechoslovakia. Not long ago, the Chinese Youth Art Troupe visited Czechoslovakia. Now, the Czechoslovak Army Art Troupe has come to China to perform. Through cultural and artistic exchanges, the people of the two countries have further enhanced their understanding and friendship.
    On August 12, the Vít Nejedlý Army Art Ensemble held a formal opening ceremony for their performances in China in the capital. Their brilliant artistic achievements have been universally praised.
    The Vít Nejedlý Army Art Ensemble is named after Comrade Vít Nejedlý, its leader who gloriously sacrificed himself in the fight against fascism. This is a young army art ensemble with less than ten years of history, but it has been tempered and grown in the arduous struggle against the enemy; and it has inherited excellent traditions from its own national heritage. They are a group of literary and artistic fighters with rich ideas and artistic accomplishments.
    Their achievements are not accidental. Czechoslovakia is a nation with a long musical history; the Czechoslovak people love to sing. As early as the end of the eleventh century, they produced the first Central European religious folk song, "God, have mercy on us!" Today, Czechoslovakia has become a place where progressive musicians from all over the world, led by the Soviet Union, hold grand music gatherings every year. The International Music Festival "Prague Spring," organized by the Czechoslovak Ministry of Culture and the Czechoslovak Composers Association since 1946, is not only a grand event for outstanding musicians from all over the world to perform; more importantly, it has become a pointer for uniting progressive musicians all over the world and guiding them to serve the people and jointly struggle and work for the cause of peace.
    Their performances include chorus, solo, dance and orchestra, with singing as the main focus. They sang "Forward for Gottwald" majestically and enthusiastically, praising their leader; they sang "The East is Red" in Chinese, expressing their respect for the leader of the Chinese people; they used the song "Glory to Stalin" to bless the great teacher and wise leader of people all over the world, recalling his contributions in the struggle for victory, and thanking him for the happiness and joy he brought to the Czechoslovak people.
    The Czechoslovak people will never forget the suffering and death that imperialism once brought to them, and they sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Korean people. They sang "Get out of Korea!" with unparalleled anger, profoundly expressing their hatred for our common enemy. This anger moved every listener.
    Heroes always live in the hearts of the people. We have learned about the indomitable and excellent qualities of the Czechoslovak people through Julius Fučík's immortal work "Report from the Gallows"; now, we have further recognized his noble character in sacrificing his life in the struggle against German fascist aggression and striving for the future happiness and freedom of the people from the fighting and rich musical language of the Czechoslovak friends singing "The Song of Julius Fučík". Fučík's confidence in the great ideals of mankind tells us that victory belongs to the people.
    They are an army art ensemble, and they are very successful in expressing the feelings of the soldiers. They proudly sing "Our Commander-in-Chief," "Glory to the Tankers," and "Glory to the Army," expressing the soldiers' respect for their leader, the soldiers' bravery and determination to defend their motherland, and the soldiers' joyful emotions.
    Folk songs representing the national character are an important part of this performance. Czechoslovak folk songs are rich. Its ancient and diverse changes are a feature. In the early 20th century, a society dedicated to the study of folk songs was established in Czechoslovakia, and more than 25,000 folk songs were registered. The Czechoslovak music community attaches great importance to this work and applies the collected folk songs to their own works. The famous composer Novák drew the essence from the source of folk songs and created excellent works, winning the National Medal. The songs "Singing Black Mountain," "When I Go to Your Place," and "Don't Be Afraid, Children" introduced this time make us feel the enthusiasm, boldness, and humor of the Czechoslovak people.
    Anyone who has seen the performance of the Vít Nejedlý Army Art Ensemble will surely praise their choir; this is a choir with high artistic accomplishment. Their optimistic mood gives the audience great encouragement. Their expressiveness is so strong that more than 100 people cooperate like one person, consistently expressing the thoughts and feelings that need to be expressed. Their voices are full of power, so majestic and beautiful; the coordination of the parts is so harmonious and beautiful. Although we do not understand the Czechoslovak language, we can feel the clarity of each word. They movingly sang "The East is Red" and "The Battle Song of the Chinese People's Volunteers." Without a high level of artistic accomplishment, we cannot imagine that they can master the mood and style of Chinese songs in a short period of time. Their soloists are also talented and accomplished singers. Mraz's sonorous and full voice expresses lofty and solemn feelings. Jedek skillfully expresses the humorous and funny character of the nation, making people laugh happily. Blum's lyrical tune, singing "Distant Place," narrates the longing of soldiers guarding the frontier away from their hometown, movingly bringing the audience back to the memories of their own hometown, feeling how lovely the motherland is, and determined to defend it. Švehla's singing of "The Shepherd Girl" (Chinese folk song) makes us feel as intimate and lovely as if we were singing it ourselves. The solos by Doležal, Šiler and others are also loved by the audience. The musical talent of the Czechoslovak people is fully demonstrated in this moving legend among their people who fully express their national pride: if a Czechoslovak child is thrown on the roof and can fall down alive, this child will become a musician when he grows up. Because the roofs of Czechoslovakia are all pointed, if the child is really thrown on the roof, they will all fall down, that is to say, Czechoslovak children can all become musicians.
    Czechoslovak folk dances also have their unique style. This feature is fully reflected in the "Parachute Dance" that reflects the life of soldiers. They are based on folk dances, combined with the life of soldiers, expressing the heroic image of Czechoslovak soldiers, high fighting spirit, as well as joyful life and optimistic emotions. We also like the "Czech Folk Dance" program, which describes how a traveling singing and dancing troupe uses a comical way to introduce the lineup of this singing and dancing troupe and the many programs it brings, such as tightrope walking, weightlifting, somersaults and other performances. This program is very funny and humorous. The most exciting is the "Czechoslovak Army Friendship Dance," which makes people feel the great friendship and growing strength of the two brother armies. This dance team vividly and beautifully expresses the life, feelings of the Czechoslovak army and people. Their orchestra is also excellent, it enriches the singing and dance performances.
    From their entire performance, we saw that the music and dance of the Czechoslovak troops have made achievements in accepting the excellent traditions of the nation. They have absorbed the essence from the rich source of folk songs, concentrated and improved it. This kind of music and dance art that comes from the people, has been developed and improved, and expresses the new thoughts and feelings of the Czechoslovak people today will surely be loved by our vast number of soldiers and the people. Their performances in various parts of China will undoubtedly be a great success.

    充满力量的音乐和舞蹈
    ——记捷克斯洛伐克“维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团”的演出
    朱树兰
    应邀来中国访问的捷克斯洛伐克“维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团”，正在中国人民解放军建军二十五周年纪念的时候来到北京。他们在“八一”体育运动大会举行闭幕式的晚上，第一次和部队的体育、文艺代表以及首都数万人民见了面。人们热烈地欢迎来自遥远的东欧兄弟国家的嘉宾和战友。
    维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团，是一个以他们自己民族的艺术与苏联先进的社会主义现实主义艺术武装了的，战斗化、群众化的优秀文艺团体。他们卓越的音乐舞蹈表演，引起了中国观众的响亮的经久不息的掌声和欢呼。在先农坛的广场上，水银灯照亮了表演台，他们的一百一十多人的合唱队、六十多人的管弦乐队和四十多人的舞蹈队的动人的演出，给观众以深刻难忘的印象。
    观众热烈爱好着那些富有力量的精彩节目。他们从那里感受到崇高的爱国主义和国际主义精神的教育，深切体会到中捷两国的亲密友谊。不久以前，我国青年文艺工作团访问过捷克斯洛伐克，现在捷克斯洛伐克的军队文艺工作团又来到中国演出，两国人民通过文化艺术的交流，更加增进了彼此的了解和友爱。
    八月十二日，维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团在首都举行了在中国演出的正式开幕式。他们的光辉的艺术成就，受到了人们普遍的赞美。
    维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团是以光荣牺牲在对法西斯作战中的它的领导人维特·尼耶德利同志命名的。这是一个年青的、不到十年历史的军队文艺工作团，但它已经在对敌的艰苦斗争中得到锻炼而成长起来；并从自己民族的宝贵遗产中，继承了优秀的传统。他们是一群富有思想和艺术修养的文艺战士。
    他们的成就不是偶然的。捷克斯洛伐克是一个有着悠久音乐历史的民族；捷克斯洛伐克人民热爱歌唱，远在十一世纪末，他们就产生了中欧第一个宗教民歌“神呵，怜悯我们！”如今，捷克斯洛伐克已成为以苏联为首的、全世界进步音乐工作者每年举行盛大音乐集会的地方。由捷克斯洛伐克文化部主办、捷克斯洛伐克作曲家协会组织的、自一九四六年起每年一度的国际音乐节“布拉格之春”，不但是全世界优秀音乐家集中表演的盛会；更重要的是，它已成为团结全世界进步音乐工作者，和指导他们为人民服务、为和平事业共同斗争与努力方向的指针。
    他们的表演包括合唱、独唱、舞蹈和管弦乐，以歌唱为主。他们雄壮地、热情地唱着“为哥特瓦尔德前进”，歌颂自己的领袖；他们用中国语言歌唱“东方红”，表示对中国人民领袖的尊敬；他们以“光荣属于斯大林”歌曲，祝福全世界人民伟大的导师、英明的领袖，回忆他在胜利斗争中的功勋，和感谢他给捷克斯洛伐克人民带来的幸福和欢乐。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民永远不会忘记帝国主义曾经带给他们的苦难和死亡，他们同情和支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争。他们以无比愤怒的情绪唱着的“滚出朝鲜去！”，深刻地表现了对我们共同敌人的仇恨，这种愤怒的情绪激动了每一个听众。
    英雄永远活在人民心中。我们通过捷克斯洛伐克人民英雄尤利斯·伏契克不朽的著作“绞索套着脖子时的报告”中，认识了捷克斯洛伐克人民威武不屈的优秀品质；现在，我们又从捷克斯洛伐克朋友歌唱“尤·伏契克之歌”战斗的、丰富的音乐语言中，更进一步地认识了他在反对德国法西斯侵略斗争中献出自己生命，和为争取人民未来幸福和自由的高贵的品格。伏契克对人类伟大理想的信心告诉我们，胜利是属于人民的。
    他们是一个军队文艺工作团，他们在表现部队战士的感情上是很成功的。他们骄傲地歌唱“我们的总司令”、“光荣属于坦克手”、“光荣属于军队”，表现了战士对领袖的敬爱，战士的英勇和保卫祖国的决心，以及战士生活的愉快情绪。
    代表民族的性格的民歌是这次演出中重要的一部分，捷克斯洛伐克的民歌是丰富的。它那古老而又多样的变化是一个特色。二十世纪初，捷克斯洛伐克一个专门研究民歌的学会成立后，曾登记了二万五千多首民歌。捷克斯洛伐克音乐界是很重视这一工作的，并将收集的民歌运用在自己的作品里。著名作曲家诺伐克，就是从民歌的源泉中汲取精髓，创作了优秀的作品，荣获了国家勋章。他们这次来介绍的“歌唱黑山”、“当我到你那儿去的时候”、“别害怕，孩子们”，使我们感到捷克斯洛伐克人民性格的热情、豪放、风趣。
    看过维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团表演的人，一定会称赞他们的合唱队；这是一个有着高度艺术修养的合唱队。他们那种乐观的情绪，给与观众莫大的鼓舞。他们的表现力是如此之强，一百多人合作得如同一个人，一致地表现了须要表达的思想感情。他们的声音充满了力量，是这么雄壮、美丽；声部的配合是这么和谐、优美。我们虽听不懂捷克斯洛伐克语言，但能感到每个字音的清晰。他们令人感动地歌唱“东方红”和“中国人民志愿军战歌”，要不是有着很高的艺术修养，我们不能想像他们在短时期里就能掌握中国歌曲的情调和风格。他们的独唱者也都是有才能、有修养的歌唱家。姆拉斯的雄浑的、丰满的声音，表现了崇高、庄严的感情。杰德克技巧地表达了民族的诙谐和风趣的性格，使人禁不住愉快地发笑。布鲁姆的抒情的调子，唱起“遥远的地方”，叙述远离故乡、守卫边疆的战士的怀念心情，动人地把观众带回到对自己故乡的回忆中，觉得祖国是多么可爱，决心保卫它。什维赫来唱的“牧羊姑娘”（中国民歌），使我们感到如同自己在歌唱一样地亲切、可爱。多来沙尔、西勒尔等的独唱也都是观众所喜爱的。捷克斯洛伐克人民的音乐才能，在他们民间有这样一个动人的充分表现他们民族自豪心的传说：捷克斯洛伐克孩子一生下，如果被抛到屋顶上能够摔下来，这孩子长大了就会成为音乐家。因为捷克斯洛伐克的屋顶都是尖的，如果真的把孩子抛上屋顶，他们都会摔下来，也就是说捷克斯洛伐克儿童都能成为音乐家。
    捷克斯洛伐克的民族舞蹈也是有它独特的风格的。这一特色充分地表现在反映战士生活的“伞兵舞”中。它们是在民族舞蹈的基础上，结合战士的生活，表达了捷克斯洛伐克战士英勇的形像，高昂的战斗士气，以及愉快的生活和乐观的情绪。我们也欢喜“捷克民族舞蹈”的节目，描写一个到处巡回演唱的歌舞团，怎样用一种滑稽的方式向人们介绍这个歌舞团的阵容，和它带来的许多节目，如走钢丝、举重、翻跟斗等表演。这个节目是非常风趣和幽默的。最令人兴奋的是“捷苏军队友谊舞”，它使人感到两个兄弟部队伟大的友情和壮大的力量。这个舞蹈队生动地、优美地表现了捷克斯洛伐克军队和人民的生活感情。他们的管弦乐队也是出色的，它丰富了歌唱和舞蹈的演出。
    从他们整个的表演中，使我们看到了捷克斯洛伐克部队的音乐舞蹈，在接受民族的优秀传统上是有成绩的，他们从民间丰富的源泉中吸取了精华，加以集中和提高。这种来自民间的，加以发展和提高的，表现了今天捷克斯洛伐克人民新的思想感情的音乐舞蹈艺术，必将为我们广大战士和人民群众所喜爱。他们到中国各地去演出，无疑会得到很大的成功。
