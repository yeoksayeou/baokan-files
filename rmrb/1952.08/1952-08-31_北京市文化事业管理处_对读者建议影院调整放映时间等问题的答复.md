    Reply to Readers' Suggestions on Adjusting Cinema Screening Times and Other Issues

    Editor's Note: People's Daily readers Chen Zhonglin, Zhang Yousong, Zheng Yan, Li Minjie, Zhao Guangli, and others have written, hoping that cinema screening times can accommodate the working hours of government offices, suggesting the elimination of intermissions, and hoping that good films can be extended for another day or two after the initial run. We forwarded these opinions to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau, and the results of their consultation with relevant units and the Beijing Film Industry Association are as follows:

    I. The arrangement of cinema screening times is always carefully considered comprehensively. Arranging two screenings in the evening is more appropriate, but the last screening should not end too late (there are government regulations on ending times). Comrade Zhang Yousong suggested having a screening around 7:30 PM, which would be suitable for cadres from government offices to watch movies, but if this movie is shown, the next screening would be around 10:00 PM, which would end too late. If it is moved earlier, it would have to be shown around 5:00 PM, which would not be suitable for general audiences. Therefore, the cinema's discussion resulted in accepting Comrade Chen Zhonglin's suggestion to appropriately adjust the evening screening times. Among the cinemas screening the same film, one or two cinemas in different areas will have screening times suitable for the working hours of government offices.

    II. Regarding the issue of eliminating intermissions, the discussion concluded that longer films still require intermissions to allow for air circulation and to accommodate some audience members who need to drink water, smoke, or use the restroom. If the film is short, the intermission will be eliminated. It should be mentioned here that there are currently few film copies available. Two or more cinemas are showing one copy. Each reel of film must be promptly delivered to another cinema after being shown. If there is an accident during the delivery or at a cinema, causing a temporary shortage, it may result in a special intermission at another cinema.

    III. The suggestion of extending good films for another day or two after the initial run is excellent. After the initial run, individual cinemas can extend the screening for another day or two after an interval, or distribute them to second-run cinemas.

### 北京市文化事业管理处  对读者建议影院调整放映时间等问题的答复

    对读者建议影院调整放映时间等问题的答复
    编者按：本报读者陈仲林、张友松、郑晏、李民杰、赵光礼等分别来信，希望影院放映时间能适合机关作息时间、建议取消中途休息及希望好的影片一期映完后再续映一两天。我们将这些意见转给北京市人民政府文化事业管理处，他们和有关单位联系并建议北京市电影业公会讨论后的结果如下：
    一、电影院排列放映时间，是经常注意照顾全面的。晚上排列两场比较合适，但最后一场不宜散场太晚（政府有规定的散场时间）。张友松同志建议七点半左右放映一场，这时间是适合机关干部看电影，但演了这场电影下一场在十点左右才能放映，散场就嫌太晚。假若提前，只有在五点左右放映，这又不适合一般观众看电影。因此，影院方面讨论结果，是接受了陈仲林同志的意见，把晚上两场电影时间适当调整，在放映同一个片子的几家影院中，在不同的区域，有一两家影院的放映时间适合机关的作息时间。
    二、取消中途休息问题，讨论结果是影片长尚需要休息，以便换空气及照顾部分观众喝水、吸烟、上厕所等。若片短则取消。这里应附带提一下，目前影片拷贝较少，有两家以上影院放映一个拷贝，每放映完一卷影片就得及时接送到另家影院，在接送中途或某家影院发生事故，一时供不上，也会形成另一家影院的特殊的休息。
    三、好的影片映完一期后再续映一两天这意见很好，可以做到一期映完后，隔一期由个别影院再续映一两天，或分配二轮影院放映。
