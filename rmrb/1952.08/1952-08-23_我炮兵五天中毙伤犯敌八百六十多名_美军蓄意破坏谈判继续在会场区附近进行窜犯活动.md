    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 22nd -- On the eastern front, east of the Bukhan River, enemy troops attacked a nameless height defended by our army on the morning of the 17th. They launched multiple assaults with forces ranging from a platoon to a company, all of which were repelled by our artillery fire. Later, the enemy launched a flanking attack on our army from the east of the height with a battalion of troops, which was again repelled by our heroic infantry in a counter-offensive. At 2:00 PM, the enemy gathered two battalions of infantry in an attempt to attack again, but were met with fierce bombardment by our artillery. In this battle, our army killed or wounded more than 500 enemy soldiers. This was the largest battle in the five days from the 16th to the 20th.

    The U.S. invading army, deliberately sabotaging the armistice negotiations and creating a tense situation, continued to conduct raiding activities near the Panmunjom conference area. On the 16th, an enemy platoon invaded our army's position about five kilometers east of Panmunjom and was immediately and resolutely repelled by our defending troops. On the 17th, enemy troops again launched six raiding attempts on the same location with ten squads of troops, all of which were repelled by our army. The enemy suffered 28 casualties. On the same day, a group of enemy troops raided a certain location about five kilometers south of Panmunjom, and retreated after being killed or wounded by our army, suffering eight casualties.

    In other areas of the front, the Korean and Chinese People's Army also killed and wounded many enemies in various small-scale battles. On the 20th, an outpost unit of our army encountered an enemy squad in a certain location southwest of Kimhwa. The soldiers immediately annihilated the entire enemy squad with swift action. According to incomplete statistics, our artillery killed or wounded more than 860 enemy soldiers and destroyed or damaged 23 enemy tanks in the five days from the 15th to the 19th.

    美军蓄意破坏谈判继续在会场区附近进行窜犯活动
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】在东线北汉江以东地区，敌军于十七日晨向我军守卫的一个无名高地进犯，他们连续以一个排至一个连的兵力进行多次冲锋，都被我军炮火击退。以后敌军以一个营兵力从该高地以东向我军进行侧击，又被我英勇的步兵以反冲锋击退。下午二时，敌军又集结了两个营的步兵企图再犯，遭到我军炮火的猛烈轰击。在这次战斗中，我军毙伤敌军五百多名。这是十六日至二十日五天中的最大的一次战斗。
    蓄意破坏停战谈判，制造紧张局势的美国侵略军，在板门店会场区附近继续进行窜犯活动。十六日，敌军一个排进犯板门店以东五公里左右的我军阵地，当即被我守军坚决击退。十七日，敌军又以十个班的兵力先后向该处进行了六次窜犯，都被我军击退。敌军伤亡二十八名。同日，一股敌军又向板门店以南五公里左右的某处窜犯，被我军毙伤八名后溃退。
    在前线其他地方，朝中人民军队也在各种小型战斗中杀伤许多敌人。二十日，我军一支前哨部队在金城西南某处与敌军一个班遭遇，战士们即以迅猛动作将该敌全部歼灭。据不完全统计，我军炮兵在十五日至十九日的五天中，共毙伤敌军八百六十多名，并击毁击伤敌军战车二十三辆。
