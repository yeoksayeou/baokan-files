Continue Efforts to Do a Good Job in This Year's Wheat Procurement

Since the beginning of this year's wheat procurement work in June, under the leadership of the Central Government and governments at all levels, and through the joint efforts of state-owned grain companies and cooperatives, significant achievements have been made.

This year's wheat procurement plan was formulated based on the basically good wheat harvest, the desire of the vast number of farmers to sell wheat, and consideration of the legitimate operations of private businesses. The implementation of the procurement plan has also been relatively smooth. The procurement plan for June and the first half of July has been exceeded. June completed 137.6 percent of the plan, an increase of 58.4 percent compared to the same period last year. In the first half of July, wheat markets in some areas were slightly affected by requisitions or rain, but the procurement situation of most state-owned grain companies was still good. According to incomplete statistics, the country has completed more than 48 percent of the monthly plan in the second half of July. East China, a major wheat-producing area, exceeded the target by more than 17 percent. The Southwest region did not complete the plan in June, but has greatly increased in July. Recently, widespread rainfall in various places indicates a promising autumn grain harvest. It is estimated that farmers will continue to sell their surplus wheat in the future. Judging from all the subjective and objective conditions currently available, it is possible to fully complete the state's wheat procurement plan for this year.

The biggest characteristic of this year's wheat procurement work, and also one of the important reasons for the achievements, is the close combination of state-owned grain companies and cooperatives in the procurement work, which has formed a strong wheat procurement network throughout the country. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong, Zhejiang, Anhui, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan, and Pingyuan, the number of procurement points entrusted to cooperatives for wheat procurement has reached 6,119. Shandong province alone has 1,770, and Hebei has 1,564. Therefore, the proportion of purchases made by cooperatives is increasing day by day. For example, in June, the amount purchased by cooperatives nationwide accounted for 32 percent of the amount purchased by grain companies, and in the first half of July, it increased to 62 percent. In the East China region, the proportion of purchases made by cooperatives has reached 71 percent, and in North China, it has reached 68 percent. The purchase of wheat by cooperatives has not only played a major role in completing the state's procurement tasks, but also greatly promoted the development of its own business.

Another important factor in the success of wheat procurement is the correct grasp and implementation of a rational price policy. From the beginning of procurement to the present, wheat prices across the country have remained stable, except in individual regions, and the listed prices have matched the market prices. In terms of exchange ratios, rice-producing areas have consistently maintained an exchange ratio of 0.7 to 0.75 jin of rice for one jin of wheat, and approximately one jin of millet for one jin of wheat. The phenomenon of unreasonable price differences in the bordering areas of Shandong, Hebei, Pingyuan, Anhui, and Henan has also been adjusted.

Due to the state's support and encouragement for all legitimate private businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood to participate in procurement work, private businesses in various places have begun to change their wait-and-see attitude since the "Five-Anti" campaign. Some businesses have begun to actively engage in wheat procurement. For example, in early June, Wuxi businesses went to wheat-producing areas such as Northern Anhui, Shandong, and Northern Jiangsu to purchase wheat. Some private flour mills in the Southern Jiangsu region are raising funds to go to various areas to purchase wheat. Private businesses in North China, Beijing, and Tianjin have gone to wheat-producing areas such as Taian and Jining in Shandong to conduct procurement. This year, the amount of wheat purchased by private businesses accounts for a certain proportion. For example, in June, the proportion of purchases made by private businesses (including peddlers) in 13 key markets in Shandong accounted for 44.3 percent of the total purchases.

However, the development of wheat procurement work is still uneven. For example, in the first half of July, the Central South region only completed 21 percent of the monthly plan, the Northwest region only completed 8.6 percent of the monthly plan, and Shanxi in the North China region completed 14.2 percent of the monthly plan. The reason why cadres of grain companies in these regions did not complete the planned tasks is, first of all, that they did not do enough in implementing the policy of relying on cooperatives for procurement. For example, in the first half of July, the proportion of purchases made by cooperatives in the Central South region only accounted for 5.8 percent, and in the Northwest region, it only accounted for 28.6 percent. A few cadres of state-owned grain companies mistakenly believe that purchasing wheat through cooperatives is "troublesome"; some cadres of cooperatives also lack a sufficient understanding of the importance of this year's wheat procurement, and have a resistant attitude when accepting tasks. These erroneous ideas must be corrected immediately. State-owned grain companies and cooperatives in various places should, according to the joint instructions of higher-level cooperatives and higher-level companies, start from the overall work, establish specific implementation contracts, and take the initiative to solve some problems existing in the current procurement.

Because some cadres do not have enough understanding of the importance of wheat procurement, they neglect the publicity and specific organization of wheat procurement, and do not enthusiastically receive farmers who sell wheat. For example, some people think that as long as the listed price is posted, people will come to sell wheat. As a result, farmers push their wheat around to sell, to the point where they sell it at a price lower than the listed price, while cooperatives receive very little wheat at the reasonable listed price. Some procurement stations also have problems with their organization, such as farmers who sell grain having to wait too long and not being able to get water. Some procurement stations put forward the slogan of "three nos" (no thirst, no sun, no waiting) and "two happy" (happy to come, happy to leave) for farmers selling grain, which is absolutely necessary.

In addition, some regions have done a poor job in organizing private business purchases, and a few cadres have a "take-all" mentality. For example, there are too many procurement points set up by state-owned grain companies and cooperatives, the regulated regional price differences are too tight, and there are too many licenses and complicated procedures for private businesses to go to the countryside to purchase. It is necessary for governments at all levels to strengthen market management, and for state-owned grain companies and cooperatives to closely cooperate and effectively lead the grain market, and prevent private businesses from arbitrarily raising or lowering wheat prices. However, as long as private businesses operate honestly and earn legitimate profits, it is completely permissible. Therefore, state-owned grain companies must implement the policy of "collecting from both urban and rural areas", grasp reasonable regional price differences, and provide various conveniences for legitimate private businesses to engage in rational wheat transportation, so as to fully meet farmers' demands for selling wheat.

In the wheat procurement work in all regions of the country, only by further solving the above-mentioned problems can we better complete the wheat procurement task.

### 继续努力做好今年的小麦收购工作

    继续努力做好今年的小麦收购工作
    今年的小麦收购工作自六月份开始以来，在中央及各级人民政府的领导下，经过各国营粮食公司和合作社的共同努力，已取得显著成绩。
    今年收购小麦的计划，是根据小麦基本丰收、广大农民要求售麦，并照顾私营厂商的正当经营的情形下拟定的。收购计划的执行情况，也是比较顺利的，六月和七月上半月已超额完成了收购计划，六月份完成计划的百分之一百三十七点六，比去年同时期收购的小麦增大百分之五十八点四。七月份上半月部分地区因征收或下雨，小麦市场稍受影响，但多数国营粮食公司收购情况仍然是好的，据不完全的统计，全国七月份后半月已完成月计划的百分之四十八强。主要产麦区的华东则超额完成百分之十七强。西南区六月份没有完成计划，但七月份已大大增加。近来各地普遍降雨，秋粮丰收有望，估计今后农民将会继续出售自己的余麦。就目前所具备的一切主观和客观条件来看，是可以全部完成今年国家收购小麦的计划的。
    今年收购小麦工作中最大的特点也是取得成绩的重要原因之一，是国营粮食公司与合作社在收购工作中的密切结合，使全国形成了一个强有力的小麦收购网。根据山东、浙江、安徽、苏南、苏北、河北、河南、平原等地不完全统计，委托合作社收购小麦的收购点已达六千一百十九个，仅山东一省就有一千七百七十个，河北有一千五百六十四个。因此合作社代购的比重日渐增加，如六月份全国合作社代购数量占粮食公司收购量的百分之三十二，七月上半月则增大到百分之六十二，如华东区合作社代购比重已达百分之七十一，华北达百分之六十八，合作社代购小麦不但对完成国家收购任务起了重大作用，对合作社来说，通过代购小麦，也大大推动了本身业务的发展。
    小麦收购工作取得成绩的另一个重要因素，是正确掌握和执行了合理的价格政策。从开始收购到现在，除个别地区外，全国麦价始终稳定，牌市价吻合。在交换比价上，产大米地区，始终保持一斤小麦换大米零点七斤至零点七五斤，及一斤小麦换一斤上下小米的比价。山东、河北、平原、安徽、河南部分接壤地区差价不合理的现象，也已调整。
    由于国家扶植和鼓励一切有利于国计民生的正当私营厂商参加收购工作，各地私营厂商已开始转变
    “五反”以来的观望态度，部分厂商已开始积极进行小麦收购，如无锡厂商六月上旬分赴皖北、山东、苏北等产地收购小麦，苏南区的一些私营面粉厂都筹备资金分赴各区采购小麦。华北、北京、天津私营厂商分赴山东泰安、济宁等产麦区进行收购。今年小麦收购中，私营厂商的收购量是占了一定比重的，如六月份山东十三个重点市场私营厂商（包括小贩在内）收购比重，占收购总量的百分之四十四点三。
    但是，目前小麦收购工作的发展还是不平衡的，如七月上半月中南区仅完成月计划的百分之二十一，西北区只完成全月计划的百分之八点六，华北区的山西则完成月计划的百分之十四点二。这些地区粮食公司的干部，所以没按照既订计划完成的原因，首先是在贯彻依靠合作社进行收购的方针上作得还不够。如中南区七月上旬合作社代购比重只占百分之五点八，西北仅占百分之二十八点六。有少数国营粮食公司的干部，错误地认为通过合作社来收购小麦是“找麻烦”；某些合作社的干部，对今年收购小麦的重要意义也认识不足，接受任务时有抵触情绪。这些错误思想，必须立即纠正。各地国营粮食公司和合作社，应根据上级社及上级公司的联合指示，从整体工作出发，订立具体执行合同，并主动解决目前收购中存在的一些问题。
    由于有些干部对收购小麦的重要性认识不足，因此他们就忽视收购小麦的宣传和具体的组织工作，不热情招待售麦农民。如有人认为：收购麦子，只要挂出牌价就有人来卖。结果农民推着麦子到处去卖，以至于卖了较牌价为低的价钱，而合作社以合理的牌价收到麦子却很少。也有的收购站由于组织工作做的不好，产生售粮农民等得时间太长、喝不到水等现象。有的收购站提出对待售粮农民要“三不”（不渴、不晒、不等），“两高兴”（高兴来、高兴走）的口号，这是完全必要的。
    此外，也有些地区组织私商收购做的较差，少数干部存有“包收”思想。譬如国营粮食公司和合作社设的收购点过多，规定地区差价太紧，以及对私营厂商下乡收购的证照过多，手续繁杂等。各级人民政府加强市场管理，国营粮食公司和合作社密切配合切实领导粮食市场，防止私商任意抬高或压低小麦价格，这是必需的。但是，只要私营厂商老实经营，他们赚取合法利润，也是完全允许的，因之国营粮食公司必须贯彻“城乡兼收”的方针，掌握合理地区差价，给正当私商从事合理贩运小麦以种种方便，充分满足农民的售麦要求。
    全国各地区在小麦收购工作中，只有进一步解决上述问题，才能更好地完成小麦收购任务。
