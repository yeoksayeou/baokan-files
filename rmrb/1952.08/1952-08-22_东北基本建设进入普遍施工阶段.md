The large-scale basic construction with key points in the Northeast region, after full preparation, has now universally entered a tense construction phase. Under the leadership of local Party committees and enterprise departments, the construction units are mobilizing the masses to establish and improve the responsibility system, and are organizing and systematically promoting advanced experiences, striving to ensure project quality and complete tasks on schedule.

This year's basic construction in the Northeast region is being carried out to prepare conditions for the large-scale economic construction that is about to begin nationwide, and the scale and scope are far greater than in previous years. The total workload is 161 percent of last year's. In the industrial sector, the workload has increased by 125 percent compared to last year, and the construction area has increased by 100 percent. Among them, newly built projects (including renovations) account for the vast majority. The proportion of funds used by the Northeast Industrial Department for new construction projects has increased from 25 percent in 1949, 38 percent in 1950, and 80 percent in 1951 to 90 percent this year.

This year's basic industrial construction in the Northeast is carried out in accordance with the principle of concentrating efforts to develop heavy industry. Investment in heavy industry accounts for 82 percent. In terms of engineering design for basic construction, advanced Soviet technical standards are beginning to be adopted. The vast majority of important new construction projects are designed using the most advanced Soviet technical standards, and national investment is utilized to the maximum extent. For example, in general civil engineering construction, the interim standard for building structure design is being widely promoted. This standard was formulated by the Northeast Industrial Department based on advanced Soviet design experience and combined with China's actual conditions. Its main feature is that it greatly reduces the engineering safety factor while ensuring project quality. For example, the live load on the floor can be reduced by about 30 percent compared to the old standard, the wind pressure can be reduced by more than 50 percent, and the allowable stress of wood and steel can be increased by about 20 percent. This makes it possible to universally reduce the cost of civil engineering construction by more than 10 percent, achieving the goal of "maximizing economic capacity with the smallest investment." In order to ensure that the construction is suitable for advanced design requirements, advanced Soviet technical specifications for construction acceptance have also been widely promoted. This is an important measure to ensure project quality.

Currently, more than 30 kinds of advanced experiences have been promoted in basic construction in the Northeast. In civil engineering construction, there are Su Changyou's double-handed mortar bricklaying method, Xie Wanfu's woodworker assembly line operation method, and the concrete vacuum operation method; in mechanical installation, there are pre-assembly and foundation assembly line operations; in mine construction, there is parallel shaft operation; in geological drilling, there is Ma Wenzhi's rapid drilling method; and in construction management, there are construction factoryization and construction instruction charts. These advanced experiences have played a significant role in accelerating construction speed, ensuring project quality, and reducing project costs. For example, in the past, it took ten years to build a coal mine shaft, but now, using the Soviet parallel operation method, it can be completed in five years. The Twenty-First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Industry has implemented the concrete vacuum operation method, which can shorten the entire construction period by three-quarters, and also improve project quality and reduce project costs. Construction and installation companies have also widely adopted advanced construction machinery. Now, in any large construction site, you can see towering winches, roaring cranes, hoists, mixers, and shuttling transport vehicles. They not only greatly accelerate the progress of the project, ensure the quality of the project, and save a lot of national wealth, but also greatly reduce the heavy physical labor of the vast number of construction workers. This is a new atmosphere in China's industrial construction.

In order to adapt to this large-scale basic construction, the Northeast region has shifted the focus of industrial leadership to basic construction. From the Northeast Industrial Department to various factories and mines, the cadres in the basic construction departments have been universally strengthened, and the organization of the basic construction departments has been improved. The units of the Ministry of Industry that managed basic construction originally only had two divisions, Basic Construction and Technical Design, but now a Geology Division has been added. The Ministry of Industry's office originally only managed production, but now two-thirds of its strength has been devoted to basic construction. At the same time, the Northeast Industrial Department has vigorously developed its own construction force—construction and installation enterprises. In 1950, the entire Ministry of Industry had only one engineering company, which was developed to ten in 1951, and has increased to twenty-five this year. In addition, dozens of independent engineering teams have been established. Therefore, the basic construction projects of the Ministry of Industry are no longer contracted by private builders, which provides a strong guarantee for improving project quality, completing project tasks on schedule, and reducing project costs. On the other hand, the Northeast Industrial Department has also paid attention to actively cultivating a large number of reserve forces. This year, the funds invested in cultivating reserve forces account for 23 percent of the total investment. Namely: investment in the development of geological surveys, drilling, design and scientific research accounts for 9.5 percent of the total investment; investment in cadre training (including the construction of various technical school buildings and the addition of various instruments, etc.) accounts for 10.5 percent; investment in the development of construction and installation enterprises accounts for 3 percent. In this way, the development of reserve forces can basically meet the requirements of basic construction.

The development of basic construction work in the Northeast region is inseparable from the strong leadership of the Party. The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has repeatedly instructed Party committees at all levels to put their main strength into basic construction. Local Party committees, trade union organizations at all levels, and local people's governments have strengthened their leadership over basic construction and dispatched a large number of cadres to work in various basic construction units and construction sites. Harbin City transferred 93 cadres, cultural instructors, and broadcasters from the Industrial Department, Propaganda Department, Youth League, Federation of Trade Unions, and other units of the Municipal Party Committee to work on construction sites. Yao Xuehai, director of the Basic Construction Division of the Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Department, and Hu Chuanjing, vice chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, personally led the pilot work on the construction sites of the Harbin Institute of Technology and the Foreign Language School in order to create experience and guide the overall situation.

At present, the main problems in basic construction in the Northeast are: the phenomenon of no one being responsible on construction sites is very serious, advanced experiences have not been universally promoted, and political work is weak. As a result, some projects cannot be completed according to the planned progress, and the quality of the projects lags behind the technical requirements. In order to reverse this situation, the Northeast Industrial Department has taken a series of important measures. The issue of strengthening the responsibility system, improving project quality, and ensuring timely completion of tasks has attracted the attention of all units. Now all units are acting urgently to improve various systems, vigorously mobilize workers to find shortcuts, universally promote advanced experiences, and strengthen political work to fight against the phenomenon of no one being responsible and conservative thinking. At present, some units have achieved remarkable results. For example, the construction site of the Northeast Accounting and Statistics College, since July 26, with the assistance of the inspection team of the Changchun Municipal Party Committee, began to expose the phenomenon of no one being responsible and establish a responsibility system, the quality of the project has increased from 85 percent in the past to 95 percent now. The workers' work has also changed from passive to active. Therefore, all the projects on the construction site can be completed in advance in August.

    东北基本建设进入普遍施工阶段
    【本报讯】东北区有重点的大规模基本建设，经过充分的准备，现已普遍进入紧张的施工阶段。各施工单位在各地党委和企业部门领导下，正发动群众建立和健全责任制度，有组织有计划地推广先进经验，为保证工程质量与按期完成任务而努力。
    今年东北区基本建设，是为全国即将开始的大规模经济建设准备条件而进行的，规模与范围都远远超过往年。工作总量为去年的百分之一百六十一。工业方面，工作量比去年增加百分之一百二十五，建筑面积增加百分之一百。其中新建工程（包括改建）占绝大部分。东北工业部的资金用到新建工程上的比重，已由一九四九年的百分之二十五、一九五○年的百分之三十八、一九五一年的百分之八十增加到今年的百分之九十。
    今年东北工业的基本建设，按照集中力量发展重工业的原则进行。重工业投资比重占百分之八十二。基本建设的工程设计方面，开始采用苏联的先进技术标准。重要的新建工程，绝大部分都是用苏联最先进的技术标准设计的，而且最大限度地运用了国家投资。譬如在一般的土木建筑工程中，普遍推行了建筑物结构设计暂行标准。这个标准是东北工业部根据苏联先进设计经验，结合中国实际情况制订的。它的主要特点是：在保证工程质量情况下，大大降低工程安全系数。如楼面活荷重，可以较旧标准降低百分之三十左右，风压力可降低百分之五十以上，而木材、钢材的许可应力又提高百分之二十左右。这就可能使土木建筑工程成本普遍降低百分之十以上，达到了“以最小的投资，发挥最大的经济能力”的目的。为保证施工适于先进设计要求，又广泛推行了苏联先进的施工验收技术规范。这是保证工程质量的重要措施。
    目前东北在基本建设方面，已推行的先进经验有三十余种。在土木建筑方面，有苏长有双手挤浆砌砖法、谢万福木工流水作业法、混凝土真空作业法；在机械安装方面，有预装配、基础流水作业；在矿井建筑上有竖井平行作业；在地质钻探方面，有马文志快速钻进法；在施工管理方面，有施工工厂化、施工指示图表等。这些先进经验对加快建设速度、保证工程质量和降低工程成本都起了重大作用。例如过去建设一个煤矿竖井需十年，现在运用苏联的平行作业法五年即可完工；工业部二十一工程公司实行了混凝土真空作业法，整个工期可缩短四分之三，并且提高了工程质量，降低了工程成本。各建筑安装企业也广泛采用了先进的施工机械。现在走到任何一个较大的施工现场，都可看到高耸的卷扬机，轰轰作响的吊车、起重机、搅拌机和往来奔驰的运输汽车。它们不仅大大加速了工程进度，保证了工程质量，大量节约了国家财富，而且大大减轻了广大建筑工人笨重的体力劳动。这是中国工业建设上的新气象。
    为了适应这一大规模的基本建设，东北区已将工业领导重心转向基本建设。从东北工业部到各厂矿，普遍充实了基本建设部门的干部，健全了基本建设部门的组织。工业部管理基本建设的单位原来只有基本建设、技术设计两个处，现又增加了一个地质处。工业部办公室原来只管生产，现在抽出了三分之二的力量搞基本建设。同时，东北工业部又大力发展了自己的施工力量——建筑安装企业。一九五○年整个工业部只有一个工程公司，一九五一年发展到十个，今年增加到了二十五个。此外还成立了数十个独立的工程队。因此，工业部的基本建设工程已经完全不用私人营造商承包，在改进工程质量、按期完成工程任务和降低工程成本方面有了有力的保证。另一方面，东北工业部也注意到积极培养大量后备力量，今年投入培养后备力量的资金，占总投资额的百分之二十三。计：投资于发展地质调查、钻探、设计及科学研究方面的占总投资额百分之九点五；投资于干部培养方面（包括建设各种技术学校校舍及增添各种仪器等）的占百分之十点五；投资于发展建筑安装企业的占百分之三。这样，后备力量的发展基本上可以满足基本建设的要求。
    东北区基本建设工作的开展，同党的坚强的领导是分不开的。中共中央东北局曾数次指示各级党委把主要力量放到基本建设上去。各地党委、各级工会组织、各地人民政府都加强了对基本建设的领导，调派大批干部到基本建设各单位、各工地工作。哈尔滨市从市委工业部、宣传部，青年团，总工会及其他单位抽调了九十三名干部、文化教员和广播员到施工现场工作。市委工业部基本建设处处长姚学海与市总工会副主席胡传经并亲自领导哈尔滨工科大学、外国语专门学校工地的试点工作，以便创造经验，指导全面。
    目前东北基本建设的主要问题是：工地无人负责的现象很严重、先进经验没有普遍推广、政治工作薄弱。结果是某些工程不能按进度完成计划，工程质量落后于技术要求。为了扭转这一局面，东北工业部已采取了一系列的重要措施。关于加强责任制、提高工程质量、保证按期完成任务的问题，已引起所有单位的重视。现各单位正紧张地行动起来，健全各项制度，大力发动工人找窍门，普遍推广先进经验，并加强政治工作，向无人负责现象和保守思想作斗争。目前有的单位已有显著成绩。例如东北会计统计专科学校工地，自七月二十六日在长春市委检查组的协助下，开始揭发无人负责现象，建立负责制后，现在工程质量已由过去的百分之八十五提高到百分之九十五。工人的工作也已由被动变为主动。因而该工地全部工程可在八月份提前完工。
