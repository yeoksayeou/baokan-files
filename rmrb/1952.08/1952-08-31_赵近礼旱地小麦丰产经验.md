    Zhao Jinli's High-Yield Wheat Farming Experience in Dry Land
    Ministry of Agriculture, Central People's Government
    Douma Township in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, is a township that achieved overall high yields in this year's wheat high-yield competition. The entire township planted 6,600 mu of dryland wheat, with an average yield of 225 jin per mu, 50% higher than the county's average wheat yield (150 jin per mu). Among them, the Zhao Jinli Mutual Aid Group's 50.25 mu of dryland wheat yielded an average of 291 jin per mu, 29.4% higher than the township's average yield. Zhao Jinli's own 1.17 mu high-yield plot yielded an average of 657 jin of wheat per mu, 109.1% higher than the township's average yield, becoming the high-yield banner of the high-yield township. Zhao Jinli's creation of a new record for high-yield wheat in dry land is due to the following important experiences:
    I. Implementing Alfalfa and Wheat Rotation to Improve Soil
    Most of Douma Township is on sloping land, and soil erosion is severe. In particular, the lack of livestock and fertilizer has caused serious damage to the soil structure, directly affecting the increase in wheat yield. In this situation, Zhao Jinli adopted the method of alfalfa and wheat rotation to improve the soil and cultivate fertility. His high-yield wheat land this year was alfalfa land that was reclaimed in 1949. Alfalfa is a perennial forage with lush roots and leaves. New roots are constantly generated, and old roots are constantly withering and dying, accumulating in the soil year by year, increasing the organic matter in the soil, which can promote the soil's aggregate structure. At the same time, alfalfa is also a leguminous plant with rhizobia in its roots, which can fix nitrogen from the air, greatly increase the nitrogen-containing organic matter in the soil, and gradually decompose to maintain fertilizer for many years to come. According to Zhao Jinli's experience, it is not good to plant wheat in the year when alfalfa land is cultivated, because if wheat is planted in the same year, it is necessary to cultivate and prepare the ground as early as summer, which will inevitably reduce the number of alfalfa harvests in that year. Moreover, plowing the soil in summer when the decomposition of aerobic bacteria is strong will accelerate the differentiation of some nitrogen-containing organic matter into soluble nitrogen fertilizer, causing the wheat seedlings to grow too vigorously in winter and easily suffer from frost damage and lodging. Therefore, his alfalfa land was plowed in winter and left fallow for a winter. By the following spring, the nitrogen-containing organic matter gradually decomposed to form humus, which can promote the soil's aggregate structure. In order to fully utilize the high fertility produced by the soil due to alfalfa planting, he planted a season of cotton in the spring of 1950, and after the autumn, he pulled up the cotton stalks early and planted a season of stubble wheat. Then, in the autumn of 1951, he planted a season of regular stubble wheat, which became this year's high-yield wheat field.
    Zhao Jinli's method of using alfalfa and wheat rotation to obtain high wheat yields is good. It can not only increase wheat yield, but also alfalfa is a good feed, which can raise more strong livestock and provide conditions for the use of improved agricultural tools and collectivized production. It can also raise a large number of pigs to accumulate fertilizer and solve the fertilizer problem, which is also good for soil and water conservation. This is an important direction for increasing and stabilizing dryland wheat yields in the future. Before liberation, Zhao Jinli also implemented alfalfa and wheat rotation, rotating alfalfa once every 13 to 15 years; but at that time, there was no scientific rotation system. After each alfalfa planting, annual crops had to be planted for nine to eleven years, so it could not play its due role. Although he constantly used annual green manure crops such as peas and rapeseed to invert the stubble to restore fertility, the benefits of perennial forage rotation were no longer significant in the later stages of rotation. Based on these experiences, how to implement a reasonable rotation system on the basis of organizing the liberated peasants is still an urgent problem to be solved. At the same time, Zhao Jinli's single planting of perennial leguminous alfalfa is not sufficient to promote the stable aggregate structure in the soil. In the future, the method of mixed planting of perennial grasses and alfalfa can be tried. The roots of perennial grasses are mostly distributed in the top six or seven inches of soil. After planting, a large amount of organic matter can be accumulated in the topsoil. Leguminous forages can absorb calcium from the depths of the soil to help perennial grasses accumulate organic matter into effective humus, and promote the formation of a perfect and stable aggregate structure in the soil.
    II. Doing a Good Job in Deep Plowing During the Hot Season to Store Water and Prevent Drought
    Douma Township is located on the first terrace of the Loess Plateau on the north bank of the Wei River. The groundwater level is below ten zhang, irrigation is very difficult, and rainfall is concentrated in the three months of July, August, and September after wheat harvest and before wheat planting. Moreover, the soil is sticky, which is not conducive to water storage and the development of wheat fibrous roots. Therefore, doing a good job in deep plowing during the hot season, loosening the soil, and storing most of the summer rainwater in the soil to reduce rainwater runoff and evaporation is the basic key to ensuring a bumper wheat harvest. Zhao Jinli's method is:
    First, shallow plowing to eliminate stubble after wheat harvest to prepare for deep plowing. After harvesting the previous season's wheat, Zhao Jinli immediately used a plow without a plowshare to shallowly plow to eliminate stubble, loosen the soil, maintain the remaining moisture in the soil after wheat harvest, and accumulate rainwater to facilitate deep plowing. The depth of plowing should not exceed two or three inches, so that the weed seeds on the ground are not deeply buried in the soil and are easy to germinate, so that they can be eliminated during the next plowing.
    Second, deep plowing in the hot season to store water. After the beginning of the hot season, Zhao Jinli took advantage of the rain to deep plow twice. The first time, he used a double-soil plow to turn over four inches, and half a month later, he used a six-inch step plow to deep plow five inches, plowing once more than the average masses, and plowing deeply and thoroughly. This not only makes the roots easy to stretch and expand the root's absorption area, makes the stem base firm and not easy to lodging, but also can increase the soil's water and fertilizer retention capacity and accommodate a large amount of summer rainwater. Deep plowing can not only completely destroy the germinated weeds, but also turn the ungerminated weed seeds in the soil to the ground, let them germinate, and then eliminate them during the next plowing. Before each deep plowing, he harrowed the ground once to make the ground flat, which is conducive to plowing. After plowing, he did not harrow to allow rainwater to easily penetrate and reduce erosion. However, the depth of plowing in the hot season is not enough. In the future, it should be deepened to six or seven inches, which can better exert the effect of deep plowing and prepare better conditions for dense planting and more fertilizer application.
    Third, shallow plowing and crushing the soil in autumn, harrowing to preserve moisture. After the beginning of autumn, Zhao Jinli shallowly plowed once after the rain to loosen and crush the soil clods plowed up in the hot season and eliminate the weeds that occurred after the last plowing. Harrowing was done immediately after plowing to prevent moisture loss. After that, harrowing was done once after each rain to reduce moisture evaporation and crush soil clods. If the weather is dry and there is little rain, a stone roller is used to crush the soil clods, and a wooden hammer is used to break the soil clods.
    III. Appropriately Increase the Amount of Sowing, and Adopt a "Narrow-Row Sparse Sowing" Dense Planting Method
    The level of wheat yield per unit area is directly determined by the number of ears and grains per unit area. Zhao Jinli's high-yield wheat field has more than 342,000 wheat ears per mu, with an average of 31 grains per ear, while the average mass wheat field has only about 240,000 wheat ears, with an average of less than 20 grains per ear. This is one of the important reasons for his high yield.
    Zhao Jinli's method of increasing the number of ears and grains per unit area is:
    First, appropriately increase the amount of sowing. Zhao Jinli planted Bima No. 1 wheat, generally sowing 8 to 10 jin per mu, but he sowed 14 jin per mu. He determines this by the number of seeds. According to his experience, it is appropriate to sow about 240,000 grains per mu. In the past, the No. 302 wheat he planted had smaller particles, with 21,000 grains per jin of seeds, so he sowed 11.5 jin per mu. However, the Bima No. 1 wheat grains are large, with only 16,000 grains per jin, so he sowed 14 jin.
    Second, adopt narrow-row sparse sowing technology. Zhao Jinli's high-yield wheat field is sown with a specially made narrow-leg planter, with a row spacing of 5.1 inches, which is one inch shorter than the average masses in the area. Due to the reduced row spacing, although the amount of sowing has increased somewhat, because the number of rows has increased, the seeds distributed in each row still remain sparse and uniform, which does not affect tillering and development. Three or four days after sowing, he lightly harrowed once along the planter furrows to make the seeds and moist soil well combined, which is conducive to germination.
    Zhao Jinli's direction of narrow-row sparse sowing and dense planting is correct. Especially in areas where the row spacing of wheat fields exceeds one chi, if this method is adopted, it can not only expand the green surface of wheat plants, increase land utilization, and increase the number of ears and grains, but also reduce water evaporation between rows and suppress weed growth. However, judging from Zhao Jinli's own cultivation conditions, it still needs to be improved. His high-yield land this year sowed 240,000 grains per mu, and the total number of ears was 342,000. Kang Yulin's dryland wheat high-yield land in the same county had a total number of 402,000 ears per mu, and grew better than Zhao Jinli's before maturity. Later, it suffered a wind disaster due to late maturity, but still harvested 600 jin per mu. Referring to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, sowing 367,000 to 467,000 grains per mu can grow 350,000 to 450,000 wheat plants per mu. Therefore, Zhao Jinli can also appropriately increase the amount of sowing with the goal of 400,000 ears per mu, and use widened sowing width or cross-sowing methods, or further reduce the row spacing, to implement the principle of sparse sowing and dense planting.
    IV. Select Good Varieties, Master the Characteristics of Good Varieties, and Prevent Cold and Protect Seedlings
    The Bima No. 1 wheat selected by Zhao Jinli last year has a higher yield than all local varieties, and has high resistance to yellow rust and loose smut, and is a good variety suitable for high-yield cultivation. However, Bima No. 1 wheat has some spring wheat characteristics, and its resistance to freezing damage and frost damage is poor. Therefore, Zhao Jinli paid special attention to cold prevention and seedling protection. On the one hand, he grasped the appropriate sowing period, sowing one day before the Cold Dew last year, half a month later than the local general wheat sowing period. Because the appropriate sowing period of wheat is greatly related to the vernalization nature of the variety. For varieties with a long vernalization period and true winter wheat type, they can be sown earlier under normal circumstances. Sowing this type of wheat earlier will not cause jointing in winter, but it can build roots and grow tillers well before winter. Spring wheat varieties should be sown later in order to prevent excessive growth before winter, even jointing, and suffer from freezing damage. On the other hand, he paid great attention to seedling protection in winter. Before the ground froze, he applied 3,600 jin of stable manure per mu; using a pickaxe to spread it, covering the wheat seedlings to maintain temperature. After the ground thawed in spring, he harrowed the wheat once to compact the gaps in the soil caused by ice melting, preventing air leakage and freezing; and harrowed the hard shell on the ground to preserve moisture, and cleaned the wheat seedlings, harrowing away the withered and yellow residual leaves, so that the wheat seedlings could fully receive sunlight and facilitate returning to green growth. Local areas often suffer from late frost damage in late April. Zhao Jinli prepared horse manure and wheat bran at the edge of the field very early. Whenever it rained during the day, the sky suddenly cleared in the afternoon, the northwest wind blew at night, and he felt cold when he reached out, estimating that there might be late frost, he burned horse manure and wheat bran at the edge of the field after midnight, so that the smoke filled the field to prevent frost damage. He smoked to prevent frost a total of two times this year, so he did not suffer from frost damage. (Editor's note: Zhao Jinli's frost prevention method is very good. It is better to use leaves and dry grass as fuel for frost prevention, because horse manure and wheat bran are very good fertilizers, and it is a great waste to use them as fuel.)
    In addition to the disadvantage of being intolerant to cold, Bima No. 1 wheat will still lodge under the condition of applying more fertilizer, and it lacks resistance to the wheat midge, which is very harmful locally. Therefore, Zhao Jinli should also pay attention to carrying out continuous selection to improve the quality of the variety, cooperate with cultivation techniques to prevent lodging, or select more suitable good varieties.
    V. Apply Topdressing Fertilizer in Stages and Supply Fast-Acting Nitrogen Fertilizer in a Timely Manner
    Zhao Jinli also attached great importance to the application of fertilizer. He applied topdressing fertilizer in stages and multiple times, and timely supplied the needs of each growth and development stage of wheat, avoiding the shortcomings of applying a large amount of soluble fertilizer at one time, which would damage the wheat roots and the crops would not be able to use it up for a while, resulting in loss. His method of applying fertilizer in stages is as follows:
    Before the ground froze, he applied 3,600 jin of stable manure per mu, which not only covered the wheat seedlings to prevent them from freezing, but also was harrowed into the soil when harrowing the ground in spring, slowly decomposing and playing a role in long-term fertilizer supply.
    When the ground had just thawed in spring, he applied topdressing fertilizer old house soil (containing fast-acting nitrogen fertilizer) a total of 7,000 jin per mu in two stages. At this time, the vitality of wheat is weakened after being attacked by the severe cold of winter, and it is necessary to absorb a lot of nutrients from the soil to return to green growth. However, in the soil that has not been warmed by the sun in spring, the activity of bacteria is very low, and there is a lack of soluble nutrients. Therefore, it is very important to apply fast-acting nitrogen fertilizer in a timely manner.
    Before wheat jointing (March 29), he applied 20 jin of topdressing fertilizer ammonium sulfate per mu. This topdressing can help stem development, increase the number of ears, and make heading uniform. By the heading stage (April 22), he finally applied 20 jin of topdressing fertilizer ammonium sulfate. This fertilizer can not only increase the number of grains per ear and the fullness of wheat grains, increase yield, but also increase the protein content in the seed grains and improve quality.
    In addition to topdressing fertilizer, he also applied 5 jin of supplementary fertilizer ammonium sulfate in spring, applied to individual wheat seedlings with poor growth, so that the wheat seedlings grow neatly and the stems and ears are consistent.
    Zhao Jinli's high-yield land is grassland rotation land, which has high fertility, so he did not apply base fertilizer. However, in order to obtain higher yields and maintain the longer-lasting effect of rotation, some base fertilizer should also be applied. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union proves that: to obtain high wheat yields, it is necessary to apply fertilizer in three stages: apply stable manure as base fertilizer before plowing, apply some fast-acting base fertilizer in the rows when sowing, and apply fast-acting topdressing fertilizer again in spring. Rational application of base fertilizer can not only increase wheat yield, but also enhance wheat's winter resistance, drought resistance, cold resistance, and reduce diseases and insect pests. The experiment in Novgorod Province of the Soviet Union proved that: on the land without base fertilizer, the winter wheat overwintering survival rate was only 20%, and the application of fertilizer increased it to 45% to 53%. Based on these principles, Zhao Jinli can apply some stable manure mixed with phosphate rock or bone meal before plowing to enhance wheat's winter resistance and prevent lodging; and apply some fast-acting fertilizer in the rows when sowing, so that the wheat seeds can immediately obtain sufficient soluble nutrients in the vicinity after germination, so that it can grow good seedlings and build good roots before winter.

    赵近礼旱地小麦丰产经验
    中央人民政府农业部
    陕西省兴平县窦马乡是在今年小麦丰产评比运动中出现的全面丰产乡。全乡种了六千六百亩旱地小麦，每亩平均产量二百二十五斤，高出全县小麦平均产量（每亩一百五十斤）的百分之五十。其中赵近礼互助组全组五十亩二分半旱地小麦，平均每亩产二百九十一斤，超过全乡平均产量百分之二十九点四。赵近礼本人的一亩一分七厘丰产地，每亩平均产麦六百五十七斤，高出全乡平均产量百分之一百零九点一，成为丰产乡的丰产旗帜。赵近礼创造旱地小麦丰产新纪录，其重要经验如下：
    一、实行苜蓿和小麦轮栽，改良土壤
    窦马乡全乡大部分是斜坡地，土壤冲刷很厉害；特别是因为牲口少，肥料不足，造成土壤构造的严重破坏，直接影响了小麦产量的提高。赵近礼在这种情况下，采用了苜蓿和小麦轮栽办法来改良土壤，培养地力。他今年的丰产小麦地，是一九四九年开掘的苜蓿地。苜蓿是多年生牧草，有繁茂的根叶，新根不断发生，老根不断枯死，逐年积存在土中，增加土中有机质，可以促进土壤团粒构造。同时苜蓿又是豆科植物，根部有根瘤菌，可以固定空中氮，大量增加土中含氮有机物，逐渐分解，以维持后作多年肥料。根据赵近礼经验，耕翻苜蓿地当年种小麦并不好，因为如果在当年种小麦，必需及早在夏季耕翻，整理地面，这就必然减少了当年苜蓿收获次数；而且在夏季好气性细菌分解作用旺盛的时候翻耕土壤，会使一部分含氮有机物加速分化为可溶性氮肥，使麦苗冬季生长过旺，易遭冻害和倒伏。所以他的苜蓿地在冬季才翻耕，休闲一冬，到来春含氮有机物逐渐分解生成腐殖质，可以促进土壤团粒构造。为了充分利用土壤因种苜蓿而产生的高度肥力，所以他在一九五○年春天种了一季棉花，秋后提早拔棉秸，种了一季回槎麦，接着在一九五一年秋天种了一季正槎小麦，便是今年的丰产麦田。
    赵近礼用苜蓿和小麦轮栽办法来获得小麦丰产是好的，不但可以提高小麦产量，同时苜蓿是很好的饲料，可以多养几头壮大牲口，为采用改良农具和集体化生产提供条件，并可大量养猪积肥，解决肥料问题，对水土保持也有好处。这是今后提高和稳定旱地小麦产量的重要方向。在解放以前，赵近礼也实行苜蓿和小麦轮栽，每隔十三年到十五年要轮种一次苜蓿；但当时没有一套合乎科学的轮栽制度，每次种苜蓿后，要连种九年到十一年一年生作物，因此不能发挥应有的作用。他虽然不断用一年生绿肥作物如豌豆油菜来倒槎，以恢复地力，但到轮栽后期，多年生牧草轮栽的利益已不显著了。根据这些经验，如何在解放了的农民组织起来的基础上试行合理的轮栽制度，还是一个亟待解决的问题。同时，赵近礼单种多年生豆科的苜蓿，对促进土壤中稳定性团粒构造效用尚不足，今后可试行多年生禾草和苜蓿混栽办法，多年生禾草根原多分布在表层六、七寸土内，种植后可在表层土内大量积存有机质，豆科牧草则可以从土壤深处吸取钙质帮助多年生禾草积存的有机质变为有效腐殖质，而促使土壤形成完善的稳定性的团粒构造。
    二、作好伏天深耕工作，蓄水防旱
    窦马乡位于渭河北岸黄土高原的头道原上，地下水位在十丈以下，灌溉既很困难，雨量又集中在麦收后种麦前七、八、九三个月内，而且土质黏实，不利于蓄水及小麦须根发展。因此，作好伏天深耕，松犁土壤，把夏季雨水大部积蓄在土壤中，减少雨水流失和蒸发，是保证小麦丰收的基本关键。赵近礼的办法是：
    第一、麦收后浅耕灭茬，作好深耕准备。赵近礼在前季小麦收获后，立即用不带犁镜的犁浅耕灭茬，松动土壤，以保持麦收后土中剩余水份，并积蓄雨水，以利深耕；耕的深度不宜超过二、三寸，使地面杂草种子入土不深，易于发芽，以便下次耕地时加以消灭。
    第二、伏天深耕蓄水。入伏后，赵近礼趁雨后深耕二次，第一次用双套土犁翻四寸，半个月后，又用六寸步犁深翻五寸，比一般群众多犁一次而且犁得深、翻得透。这样，不仅使根部易于伸展，扩大了根的吸收面积，使茎基巩固，不易倒伏，并且可以增加土壤的保水保肥力，容纳夏季大量雨水。深耕除可把已发芽的杂草彻底毁灭外，并可把土中未发芽的草种子翻上地面，让它发芽，再在下次耕地时消灭。在每次深耕前，他先耱地一次，使地面平整，利于耕犁；耕后就不耙耱，使雨水易于渗入，减少冲刷。但是，伏天耕地深度还不够，今后应加深到六、七寸，这样更可发挥深耕功效，并为密植和多施肥料准备更好条件。
    第三、入秋浅耕碎土，耙耱保墒。立秋后，赵近礼在雨后又浅耕一次，目的在松碎伏天耕起的土块，消灭上次耕后发生的杂草。耕后随即耙，防止水份散失。此后每逢雨后便耙耱一次，以减少水份蒸发，并耙碎土块。如果天旱少雨，则改用石碾子碾碎土块，并用木锤打碎土块。
    三、适当增加播种量，采用“窄行疏播”的密植办法
    小麦单位面积产量的高低，直接决定于单位面积内穗数和粒数的多少。赵近礼的丰产麦地，每亩有麦穗三十四万二千多个，每穗平均有三十一粒，而一般群众麦田只有麦穗二十四万个左右，每穗平均不到二十粒。这是他获得丰产的重要原因之一。
    赵近礼增加单位面积的穗数和粒数的办法是：
    第一、适当增加播种量。赵近礼种的是碧蚂一号小麦，一般每亩下种八斤到十斤，他每亩下种十四斤。他是按种子粒数来决定的，据他的经验：每亩以种二十四万粒左右为合适。过去他种的三○二号小麦粒子较小，每斤种子有二万一千粒，每亩便下种十一斤半；但碧蚂一号麦粒大，每斤仅有一万六千粒，所以他下种十四斤。
    第二、采用窄行疏播的播种技术。赵近礼的丰产麦地是用特制的窄腿耧播种的，行距五寸一分，比当地一般群众缩短一寸。由于缩小了行距，播种量虽然增加了一些，但因为行数增加，分布到每一行内的种子仍保持稀匀疏散，不影响分蘖和发育生长。在播种后三、四天，他用耙顺着耧沟轻耙一次使种子和墒土很好结合，利于发芽。
    赵近礼这种窄行疏播密植方向是正确的。特别是麦地行距超过一尺的地区，如果采用他这种方法，不但可以扩大麦株绿色面，提高土地利用率，增加穗粒，而且可以减少行间水份蒸发，抑止杂草生长。但从赵近礼本身的栽培条件看，仍需要提高一步。他今年丰产地每亩播种量二十四万粒，总穗数是三十四万二千个；和他同县的康玉林的旱地小麦丰产地每亩总穗数达四十万二千个，在成熟前生长得比赵近礼的还好，后来因成熟较迟遭了风灾，每亩仍收六百斤。参考苏联先进经验，每亩播种量三十六万七千粒至四十六万七千粒，每亩可生长三十五万株至四十五万株小麦。因此，赵近礼还可以每亩四十万穗目标来适当增加播种量，并用加宽播幅或交叉播种法，或更缩小行距，来贯彻疏播密植原则。
    四、选用良种，掌握良种特性，防寒保苗
    赵近礼去年选种的碧蚂一号小麦，产量超过当地所有品种，而且对黄锈病和散黑穗病有高度抵抗性，是适宜于丰产栽培的良种。但是，碧蚂一号小麦带些春麦性质，耐冻害力及耐霜害力较差，因此赵近礼特别重视防寒保苗工作。他一方面掌握了适当的播种期，去年在寒露前一天下种，比当地一般种麦期晚半月。因为小麦的适当播种期，和品种春化性质有很大关系。凡春化期长，真正冬麦型的品种，在一般情况下，可以早些播种。这种小麦早些播种并不会在冬季拔节，但能在冬前札好根，长好分蘖。春麦型的品种应该播种迟些，这是为了防止冬前生长过旺，甚至拔节，遭受冻害。另一方面他很注意冬季保苗。地冻前，他在每亩地上施了厩肥三千六百斤；用铣扬开，覆盖麦苗，保持温度。开春地开冻后，他耱麦一次，使土壤因冰融作用而产生的空隙压实，防止透风受冻；并耱碎地面硬壳，保蓄水分，又清理麦苗，耱去枯黄残叶，使麦苗充分得到阳光照射，利于返青生长。当地四月下旬常有晚霜为害。赵近礼很早就在地头准备了马粪麦糠，每遇白天下雨，下午突然放晴，晚间吹西北风，伸手感到渗冷，估计有下晚霜可能，他便在半夜以后在地头燃起马粪麦糠，使烟雾弥漫田间，防止霜害。他今年一共熏烟防霜二次，因而未遭受霜害。（编者按：赵近礼的防霜办法很好。防霜用的燃料以用树叶和枯草等较好，因马粪和麦糠都是很好的肥料，用它来作燃料是一个很大的浪费。）
    碧蚂一号小麦除了不耐冷的缺点以外，在多施肥的情况下仍会倒伏，而且对当地为害很厉害的吸浆虫缺乏抵抗力。因此，赵近礼还应注意进行连续选种来提高品种质量，配合栽培技术来防止倒伏，或选用更适宜的良种。
    五、分期追肥，及时供应速效性氮肥
    赵近礼也很重视施用肥料，他分期多次施用追肥，及时供应了小麦各个生长发育阶段的需要，避免了因一次施用多量可溶性肥料而使麦根受害和作物一时用不完致遭流失的缺点。他分期施肥的办法如下：
    地冻前，他每亩施用厩肥三千六百斤，除了能覆盖麦苗防止受冻外，到来春耱地时耱入土中，缓缓分解，起着长期补给肥料的作用。
    开春地刚解冻，他便分二次每亩共施用追肥老房土（含有速效性氮肥）七千斤。这时，小麦经冬季严寒侵袭后生机衰弱，必需从土中吸取很多营养物质来返青生长，但是，春天还没有被阳光晒热的土壤中，细菌活动力很低，缺乏可溶性养料。因此，及时施用速效性氮肥是十分重要的。
    小麦拔节前（三月二十九日），每亩又施追肥硫酸铵二十斤。这次追肥，能帮助茎秆发育，增加结穗数，并使抽穗齐一。到孕穗期（四月二十二日），他最后施用了追肥硫酸铵二十斤。这次肥料，不但能增加每穗的结实粒数和麦粒的饱满度，增加产量，并且能提高种粒中蛋白质含量，改进品质。
    除追肥外，他又在春季施用了补肥硫酸铵五斤，施在个别生长不良的麦苗上，使麦苗生长整齐，秆穗一致。
    赵近礼的丰产地是牧草轮栽地，肥力较高，所以他没有施用基肥。但是，为了获得更高产量和保持轮栽较持久功效，也应施些基肥。苏联的先进经验证明：要获得小麦高额产量，必需在三个时期内施用肥料：在耕翻地以前施厩肥作基肥，在播种时行间集中施用些速效性基肥，来春再施用速效性追肥。合理的施用基肥，不但能提高小麦产量，而且可以增强小麦越冬抵抗性，耐旱、耐寒、减少病虫害。苏联诺夫哥罗得省试验证明：没有施基肥地上，冬麦越冬成活率只有百分之二十，施肥的增加到百分之四十五至百分之五十三。根据这些道理，赵近礼可以在耕地前施用些和磷灰石或骨粉混合发酵的厩肥，以增强小麦越冬抵抗性和防止倒伏；在播种时再在行间施用些速效性肥料，使麦种发芽后能立即在附近获得充分可溶性养料，以便在冬前能发好苗、扎好根。
