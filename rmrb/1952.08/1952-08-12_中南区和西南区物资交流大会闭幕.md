    The Central-South China Materials Exchange Conference successfully concluded on July 31st. The total transaction volume of the conference reached 2,323.2 billion yuan (the total purchase and sales value was 4,646.4 billion yuan), exceeding the original target of 2,000 billion yuan. In the total transaction volume, agricultural and sideline products accounted for 63.53%, industrial products accounted for 36.47%; state-owned enterprises accounted for 61.21%, private enterprises accounted for 37.43%; cash and spot transactions accounted for 38%, and term and futures transactions accounted for 62%. This conference implemented the transaction principles of "having buying and selling," "large buying and large selling," "mutual assistance and mutual benefit," "mutual support," and "fair and reasonable." The 4,188 representatives present not only included representatives from public and private industrial and commercial enterprises and cooperatives in large, medium, and small cities in the six provinces and two municipalities of the Central-South region, but also representatives from Hong Kong, Macau, and major cities across the country. Therefore, the conference was able to organize large-scale national exchanges, internal and external exchanges, and short-distance exchanges of small commodities. It also diversified the content and methods of materials exchange, opening up sales channels for a large number of slow-selling agricultural products such as live pigs, brown sugar, beans, miscellaneous grains, homespun cloth, cooking oil, and gypsum. In addition, the conference sold more than 800 billion yuan worth of industrial products, which greatly benefited the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.
    The entire process of the Central-South China Materials Exchange Conference vividly demonstrated the three important links in carrying out materials exchange: realistic purchase and sales plans, a transaction policy of mutual assistance, mutual concession, and mutual support, and the implementation of contracts. The reason why this conference was relatively successful was that it firmly grasped these three links, enabling the various economic components participating in the conference to conduct organized and planned transactions under the leadership of the state-owned economy. In addition, the conference also carried out a series of organizational work, such as professional seminars, meetings of regional representatives, small exchange meetings of provincial delegations, barter meetings of hot goods matched with slow-moving goods and slow-moving goods exchanged for hot goods, allocation meetings for certain popular goods, contract review meetings, price review meetings, and loan review meetings. This ensured that the exchange at the conference achieved satisfactory results, basically eliminated the backlog of agricultural and industrial products in the past six months, and prepared for the coming peak season in the autumn.
    The various policy promotions and many vivid examples in the transactions at the conference played a great educational role for state-owned trade cadres and private industrialists and merchants. The erroneous thinking of state-owned trade departments' staff, such as not daring to approach private merchants and fearing to do more business, began to be corrected. Private industrialists and merchants further realized that as long as they accept the leadership of the state-owned economy, eliminate the "five poisons," and operate honestly, they will have a bright future.

    The Southwest China Materials Exchange Conference, which opened in Chongqing on July 21st, closed on August 5th. The conference concluded a total of 8,333 transactions, with a transaction amount of more than 566 billion yuan (total purchase and sales value of more than 1,132 billion yuan), which is about eight times the total transaction amount of last year's local specialty product exhibition.
    Participating in this conference were representatives from public and private industries and businesses from various provinces and regions in the Southwest, as well as major cities. Public and private industries and businesses from major administrative regions such as East China, North China, Central-South, Northwest, Northeast, and major cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou also organized trade delegations or purchase and sales groups to participate. The number of participating representatives and the breadth of the connected regions were unprecedented in the Southwest. After fifteen days of contact, representatives from various regions quickly restored or established extensive trade relations. As a result, the majority of the relatively large backlog of slow-selling local specialty products in the Southwest this spring has been sold, and the sales of industrial products have also greatly expanded. For example, the long-term stockpiles of towels, knitwear, cigarettes, toothbrushes, batteries, and soap in Chongqing have all found sales channels. The enthusiasm of private industrialists and merchants has also been further enhanced.
    The conference leadership carefully reviewed the contracts signed at the conference, and any inappropriate ones were revoked. At the closing ceremony, all representatives passed a convention to ensure the implementation of the contracts without discount and to resolutely implement the price policy of the People's Government. In order to supervise public and private industrialists and merchants in various regions to earnestly implement the contracts, the Southwest China Financial and Economic Leadership Organs will establish a special agency. Local industrial and commercial administrative departments will also establish contract inspection committees to consolidate the achievements of the conference.
    The conference gave warm care and attention to the trade representatives of ethnic minorities such as the Tibetan and Yi peoples from areas such as Xikang; their requirements and wishes to participate in the conference were met as much as possible. For example, the state-owned trading company purchased all the local products that the Tibetan trade representatives planned to sell, such as musk, cordyceps, Tibetan green fruit, and blue shells, and gave reasonable consideration to the price. The conference leadership tried its best to promote the local specialty products produced in the Yi area, such as gastrodia, pine oil, and Zhu Ling. The Tibetan representatives needed to buy 20,000 catties of Sichuan West snuff, and the Sichuan West Native Products Company still managed to allocate 20,000 catties to sell to them, even though the local supply was insufficient. The Tibetan representatives also needed a batch of silk and linen fabrics, which are currently out of stock, and the Sichuan West Department Store immediately agreed to make them to order. Therefore, the ethnic minority trade representatives who participated in the conference expressed their satisfaction. Tibetan representative Gan Ma Ding Zeng and Yi representative Luo Mi Jiha Te presented Hada scarves and bamboo hats to the conference as gifts of thanks. Gan Ma Ding Zeng said when presenting the gift: "With the help and care of the conference, the Tibetan compatriots' products to be sold and bought have all achieved their wishes, which makes us deeply realize the greatness and correctness of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy. After we go back, we must mobilize the Tibetan people to improve the variety and quality of local products and further develop materials exchange work."

    中南区和西南区物资交流大会闭幕
    中南区物资交流大会在七月三十一日胜利闭幕。大会交易总额达二万三千二百三十二亿元（购销总值为四万六千四百六十四亿元），超额完成了大会原来提出的两万亿元交易额的目标。在大会交易总额中，土产品占百分之六十三点五三，工业品占百分之三十六点四七；国营占百分之六十一点二一，私营占百分之三十七点四三；现款现货成交占百分之三十八，期款期货占百分之六十二。这次大会贯彻了“有买有卖”、“大买大卖”、“互助互利”、“相互支持”、“公平合理”的交易方针。到会的四千一百八十八位代表，不但包括中南区六省二市大中小城市公、私营工商业和合作社的代表，而且有香港、澳门和全国各地主要城市的代表。因此，大会就可能组织大规模的全国性交流、内外交流、小宗商品的短距离交流，而且使物资交流的内容和方式多样化，给大量滞销土产如生猪、土糖、豆、杂粮、土布、食油、石膏等打开了销路。此外，大会并销出了工业品达八千多亿元，这样就大大有利于工农联盟的进一步巩固。
    中南区物资交流大会的全部过程，鲜明地显示出开展物资交流的三个重要环节，就是：实事求是的购销计划，互助互让、互相支持的交易方针，和合同的贯彻执行。这次大会所以开得比较成功，就是因为紧紧掌握了这三个环节，使参加这次大会的各种经济成份在国营经济领导下，进行了有组织有计划的交易。此外，大会还进行了一系列的组织工作，如专业座谈会，地区代表碰头会、省内代表团小型交流会，热货搭冷货、冷货换热货的易货会议，某些畅销货的分配会议，合同审查会议，价格评审会议，贷款审核会议等。这样，就保证了大会的交流获得圆满的结果，基本上消除了半年来土产和工业品积压的现象，并给秋后旺季的来临作了准备。
    大会的各项政策宣传和交易中许多生动事例，对国营贸易干部和私营工商业者，都起了很大的教育作用。国营贸易部门工作人员不敢接近私商，怕多作买卖等错误思想开始纠正。私营工商业者进一步体会到只要接受国营经济的领导，消除“五毒”，老实经营，就会有光明前途。    （新华社）
    七月二十一日在重庆开幕的西南区物资交流大会，已于八月五日闭幕。大会共成交八千三百三十三笔，成交金额为五千六百六十余亿元（购销总值为一万一千三百二十余亿元），约等于去年土特产展览会成交总额八倍。
    参加这次大会的有西南各省、区和各主要城市公私工商业的代表，华东、华北、中南、西北、东北各大行政区和上海、广州、汉口等大城市的公、私工商业也都组织了贸易代表团或购销小组参加。参加代表之多，联系地区之广，在西南是第一次。各地代表经过十五天的接触，迅速地恢复或建立了广泛的贸易关系，因此，西南区今春积压的比较大宗的滞销土特产品，绝大部分已打开销路，工业品的销路也大为扩大，例如重庆市毛巾针织、纸烟、牙刷、电池、肥皂等行业长期积压的物品都已找到销路。私营工商业者的经营积极性也因而进一步提高。
    大会领导方面对这次会上签订的合同，进行了认真的审查，不合适的都予撤销。在大会闭幕会上，全体代表通过一项公约，保证不折不扣地执行合同，坚决贯彻人民政府的价格政策。为监督各地公私工商业者认真执行合同，西南区财经领导机关将成立专门机构。各地工商行政部门也将成立合同检查委员会，以巩固大会成果。
    这次大会对于来自西康等地区的藏族和彝族等少数民族贸易代表，予以热切的关怀和照顾；对他们参加这次大会的要求和愿望，尽量予以满足。例如：藏民贸易代表准备卖出麝香、虫草、藏青果、青贝等土产，国营贸易公司就全部收购，并在价格上予以合理照顾。彝族地区所产的天麻、松油、朱苓等土特产品，大会领导方面尽量予以推销。藏民代表要买进川西鼻烟两万斤，川西土产公司在不敷供应本地需要的情况下，仍旧设法调拨了两万斤售给他们。藏民代表又需要一批丝麻织品，目前缺货，川西百货公司当即答应替他们订制。因此，参加大会的少数民族贸易代表都表示满意，藏族代表甘马丁增和彝族代表罗米吉哈特向大会献哈达、笠帽等礼物致谢。甘马丁增在献礼时说：“藏族同胞要卖和要买的产品，经大会的帮助和照顾，都达到了自己的愿望，使我们更深刻地体会到毛主席民族政策的伟大、正确。我们回去后一定要发动藏族人民好好改进土产的品种质量，进一步开展物资交流工作。”（新华社）
