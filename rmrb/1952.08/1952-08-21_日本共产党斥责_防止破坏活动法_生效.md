    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on July 21, when the so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" drafted by the Yoshida government came into effect, severely condemning and resolutely opposing this fascist decree. The statement said:
    Despite the opposition of the majority of the Japanese people, and the protests and opposition of peace-loving people and democratic groups around the world, the Yoshida traitorous government announced the implementation of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" on July 21. On the same day, it appointed Goiichi Fujii as the first Director-General of the "Public Security Investigation Agency," Ichiro Takahashi as the Deputy Director, and appointed directors of the "Public Security Investigation Bureaus" in eight regions across the country.
    This is a declaration of war by the traitorous government against the peaceful people. At the same time, it is also a declaration of challenge to all peace-loving neighboring countries. The purpose of the traitorous government is to suppress all kinds of movements of peace-loving people, strengthen US military bases, promote Japanese rearmament, restore the conscription system, forcibly participate in the war of aggression against Korea, implement various wartime systems domestically, and implement war-preparedness tax increases.
    Their current goal is to implement the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" in order to use police violence to suppress the national peace movement centered on workers. However, this attempt will completely fail and will produce results contrary to the purpose of the traitorous government. This is because our party and the world peace forces' calls for peace, opposition to rearmament, and opposition to conscription have resounded throughout the remote countryside. The uncooperative attitude of the Japanese people towards the US military's air defense exercises also demonstrates this.
    The national demands for defending peace, defending livelihoods, and defending Japanese independence will not change in the slightest due to the implementation of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act." If the traitorous government illegally suppresses the legitimate activities of the people, the people's anger will burn like a flame.
    If the Yoshida traitorous government uses laws suppressing the people as weapons to forcibly promote war policies among the Japanese people, assisting the aggressors, the anger of the Japanese nation will erupt as a flame that shatters everything.
    In order to strive for the peace and independence of the Japanese nation, and to establish a national united front aimed at liberating Japan, the Japanese Communist Party hereby declares on the day of the implementation of this vicious decree that it will stand at the forefront and fight fearlessly.

### 日本共产党斥责“防止破坏活动法”生效

    日本共产党斥责“防止破坏活动法”生效
    【新华社二十日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党中央指导部曾在吉田政府制订的所谓“防止破坏活动法”生效的七月二十一日发表声明，严厉斥责和坚决反对这个法西斯的法令。声明说：
    吉田卖国政府不顾日本大多数人民的反对，也不顾全世界爱好和平的人民和各民主团体的抗议和反对，在七月二十一日公布实施“防止破坏活动法”，并在当天任命滕井五一郎为第一任“公安调查厅”长官，高桥一郎为次官，并任命了全国八个地区的“公安调查局”局长。
    这是卖国政府对和平人民的宣战布告。这同时也是对爱好和平的各邻邦挑战的宣言。卖国政府的目的是要镇压爱好和平的人民的各种运动，加强美军基地，促进日本重新武装，恢复征兵制度，强行参加侵朝战争，施行国内各种战时体制，实行备战的增税。
    他们当前的目标是实施“防止破坏活动法”，以便用警察的暴力来压制以工人为中心的国民和平运动。但是，这个企图将完全破产，将产生和卖国政府的目的相反的结果。因为我党和世界和平力量的拥护和平、反对重整军备、反对征兵的呼声已经响遍了穷乡僻壤。日本人民对美军的防空演习所采取的不合作的态度，也表现了这一点。
    保卫和平、保卫生活、保卫日本独立的国民要求，并不因为实施了“防止破坏活动法”而有丝毫改变。如果卖国政府对人民的正当活动加以非法的镇压，人民的忿怒将和火焰一样地燃烧起来。
    吉田卖国政府如果以镇压人民的法律为武器，协助侵略者在日本国民中间强制推行战争政策，日本民族的忿怒将成为粉碎一切的火焰而爆发出来。
    日本共产党为争取日本民族的和平与独立，为了成立以解放日本为目标的国民统一战线，在实施这个恶毒法令的日子，特此声明要站在最前列，奋不顾身地进行斗争。
