Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Our reporter recently interviewed Pastor Oetoesia, Vice Chairman of the North Sumatra Peace Committee, the Indonesian representative who came to Beijing to participate in the preparatory committee work for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Pastor Oetoesia answered the reporter's questions as follows:

Question: What are your views on the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the current situation in the Asian and Pacific regions?

Answer: The convening of this conference will have a great impact on the struggle for peace in Asia and the world. Take Indonesia, for example. The vast majority of the people demand peace and oppose war. The Indonesian people have suffered greatly from the imperialist policy of arms expansion and war preparation. They have expressed strong opposition to accepting U.S. "military aid," the "embargo" policy, and the recent so-called "Mutual Security Act," because these "aid" and "agreements" are nothing more than steps taken by U.S. imperialism to prepare for war.

Question: What are your impressions of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in June?

Answer: The June preparatory meeting had a great attraction for the Indonesian people. People from all walks of life in Indonesia are very concerned about the news of the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Ms. Suwati, the Indonesian representative who participated in the preparatory meeting, was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life after returning home and reporting on the proceedings of the meeting. Responsible persons from various people's organizations attended the welcoming meeting and listened to her report with excitement. As far as I know, many newspapers and periodicals in Indonesia published Ms. Suwati's remarks to reporters at the airport. The declaration of the preparatory meeting centrally represents the long-standing demands and aspirations of the Indonesian people for peace. As a Christian, I would say that this desire for peace is also in accordance with God's will.

Question: How are the people and peace organizations of your country preparing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference scheduled to be held in Beijing in September?

Answer: The Indonesian peace organization—the Indonesian National Peace Committee—is now vigorously carrying out propaganda work and actively promoting the preparation and selection of representatives to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The Indonesian National Peace Committee is now actively preparing to hold mass peace rallies in many major cities throughout Indonesia to convey the proceedings of the preparatory meeting to the Indonesian people and report on the significance of the peace conference to be held in Beijing in September. Jakarta's "New News," "People's Daily," and many other newspapers in Medan have published the declaration of the preparatory meeting and related news. The Indonesian National Peace Committee also sends a special bulletin to local Peace Committee branches every week. The peace organization in Indonesia has a great influence in society. In Indonesia, many small villages now have branches and sub-branches of the Peace Committee. In many villages, the halls are decorated with peace flags when residents hold weddings. From this point, it can be seen that the power of the people's love for peace is much greater than the power of persecuting the peace movement. Of course, there are difficulties. My own coming to Beijing to participate in the work of the preparatory committee for the Peace Conference was opposed and obstructed by some people in the leadership of the church organization. They revoked my position in the North Sumatra Christian Church. But the people wanted me to come, and ninety percent of the Christians in North Sumatra supported my coming. For the sake of truth and to fulfill the wishes of the people, I did not bow to difficulties but resolutely came. I believe that our people are aware, and they will overcome various difficulties and obstacles to help the representatives they have selected to successfully come to Beijing to attend the conference.

Question: What are your expectations for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference?

Answer: I sincerely pray for the smooth convening and success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. I firmly believe that through this conference, the peace movement will be further expanded, uniting the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions to save peace and overcome the war threats of the aggressors. Through this conference, I hope to quickly end the Korean War, oppose the remilitarization of Japan, and reasonably resolve conflicts in Vietnam, Malaya, and other places, so that the people of these countries can enjoy a peaceful life.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Yangon dispatch: Burmese people's peace movement organizations are actively preparing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and are strengthening the development of the peace movement among people from all walks of life in Burma.

The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace supports the declaration and proposals on preparatory work passed by the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing in June, and elected Wu Tun Aung Kyaw, Vice Chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Chairman of the All-Burma Civil Servants Federation, to go to Beijing to participate in the preparatory work for the meeting. The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace is preparing to select representatives in early August to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing. The representatives will include executive members of the Peace Committee, freelancers, workers, farmers, students, youth, businessmen, cooperative staff, women, monks, and regional representatives.

The Burmese representatives who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference gave reports on the preparatory meeting at many gatherings. Representative U Dun Ba Min, after returning to Yangon on July 4, made a statement to reporters, pointing out that the success of the meeting not only guaranteed peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, but also made a great contribution to world peace. He also exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare. He also said: Having traveled so many places in China, I have not found the slightest breath of war. Everywhere I see only peace movements and permanent construction work. Another representative who participated in the preparatory meeting, Wu Ai Ji, believes that the meeting's call for free trade between countries is beneficial to Burma.

In order to implement the decision of the All-Burma Peace Conference held from May 10 to 13, the Central Executive Committee of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace launched the "Signature Campaign for Demanding that the Five Great Powers Conclude a Peace Pact, Opposing the Armament of Japan and the Unilateral Peace Treaty with Japan, and Striving for Domestic Peace" on July 10. The Yangon Peace Committee was the first to respond to the call and launched a signature campaign in all districts of the city from July 11, and conducted street speeches. At the same time, the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace has issued a "Call for Striving for Domestic Peace" to the people of Burma. The appeal stated:

"The people of Burma should unite to build the country, overthrow all enemies that cause Burma to become a battlefield, and join hands with peace-loving people to stop the war-makers."

    积极筹备参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    印尼各地将举行群众和平大会
    缅甸和平组织并发起争取国内和平运动
    【新华社十二日讯】本社记者日前访问了前来北京参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会工作的印度尼西亚代表、北苏门答腊和平委员会副主席乌托西亚牧师。乌托西亚牧师对记者所提出的问题答复如下：
    问：你对召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和目前亚洲及太平洋区域的局势有何看法？
    答：这个会议的召开对于争取亚洲及世界的和平有很大影响。拿印度尼西亚来说，广大人民都要求和平，反对战争。印度尼西亚人民是深受帝国主义扩军备战政策的灾害的。他们对于接受美国的“军事援助”、“禁运”政策以及最近的所谓“共同安全法”都表示强烈反对，因为这些“援助”和“协定”无非都是美帝国主义为了准备战争而采取的步骤。
    问：你对六月间举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议有何观感？
    答：六月筹备会议对印尼人民有很大的吸引力。印尼各界人民对于召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的消息都十分关怀。参加筹备会议的印尼代表苏瓦蒂女士回国后报告了会议的经过，受到各界人民热烈的欢迎。各人民团体负责人都出席了欢迎会，兴奋地听她的报告。据我所知，印尼的许多报刊都登载了苏瓦蒂在机场对记者发表的谈话。筹备会议的宣言集中地代表了印尼人民长久以来对于和平的要求与愿望。我以基督教徒身份来说，这种和平愿望，也符合上帝的意旨。
    问：贵国人民及和平组织如何筹备参加定于九月间在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议？
    答：印尼的和平组织——印尼全国和平委员会现在正大力进行宣传工作，积极推动筹备和选派代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的工作。现在印尼全国和平委员会正积极筹备在全印尼许多大城市召开群众性的和平大会，向印尼人民传达筹备会议的经过，并报告将在九月在北京召开的和平会议的意义。雅加达的“新报”、“人民日报”等以及棉兰的其他许多报纸都刊载了筹备会议的宣言和有关的消息，印尼全国和平委员会每周还有专门的通报寄到各地和平委员会分会。印尼的和平组织在社会上的影响是很大的。在印尼，有许多小乡村现在都已有和平委员会的分会和支部。有许多乡村的居民在举行婚礼时，礼堂里都装饰着和平的旗帜。从这一点上，可以看出人民热爱和平的力量比迫害和平运动的力量强大得多。当然困难是有的。我本人此次来北京参加和平会议筹备委员会的工作，就曾遭到教会领导机构中某些人的反对和阻挠。他们撤消了我在北苏门答腊基督教会的职位。但是人民要我来，北苏门答腊的百分之九十的基督教徒拥护我来。为了真理，为了满足人民的愿望，我没有向困难低头而毅然决然地来了。我相信我们的人民是有觉悟的，他们将会战胜各种困难和障碍，帮助他们所选派的代表，胜利地前来北京出席会议。
    问：你对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议有何期望？
    答：我衷心祈祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的顺利召开和成功。我深信通过这个会议将使和平运动更为扩大，把亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民都团结起来，拯救和平，战胜侵略者的战争威胁。通过这次会议，我希望能迅速结束朝鲜战争，反对日本的重新军国主义化，并合理地解决越南、马来亚等地的冲突，使这些国家的人民得到和平生活。
    【新华社十二日讯】仰光消息：缅甸人民的和平运动组织正积极筹备参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，并在缅甸各阶层人民中间加强开展和平运动。
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会拥护六月间在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议所通过的宣言及关于筹备工作的提议，并选出缅甸保卫世界和平委员会副主席、全缅公务员联合会主席吴吞昂觉到北京参加会议的筹备工作。缅甸保卫世界和平委员会准备在八月初选出代表前往北京出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，代表中将包括和平委员会执行委员、自由职业者、工人、农民、学生、青年、商人、合作社工作人员、妇女、僧侣和地区代表等。
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的缅甸代表回国后，曾在许多集会上作了关于筹备会议的报告，代表宇登帕敏在七月四日返抵仰光后曾对记者发表谈话，他指出：会议的成功不但使亚洲及太平洋区域的和平有了保障，而且对世界和平有了莫大的贡献。他还揭露了美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行。他又说：在中国走了这么多的地方，没有发现丝毫的战争气息，到处看到的只是和平运动和永久性的建设工作。参加筹备会议的另一代表吴埃支认为会议号召各国进行自由贸易是对缅甸有利的。
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会中央执行委员会为实现五月十日至十三日举行的全缅和平大会的决定，已于七月十日发动了“要求五大国缔结和平公约，反对武装日本及片面对日和约，争取国内和平的签名运动”，仰光市和平委员会首先响应号召，从七月十一日起在全市各区发动签名运动，并进行街头演讲。同时缅甸保卫世界和平委员会已向缅甸全国人民发表“争取国内和平”的呼吁书。呼吁书指出：
    “缅甸全国人民应团结起来，建设国家，推翻促使缅甸沦为战场的一切敌人，与爱好和平的人民共同携手制止战争制造者。”
