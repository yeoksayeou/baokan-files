Respected General Comrade:

On the occasion of the Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I am honored to extend to you, and through you to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the comradeship greetings and heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the Czechoslovak People's Democratic Army and myself.

The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, which grew up in the victorious battles against the Chiang Kai-shek counter-revolutionary army and foreign intervention forces, today forms a fraternal alliance with the invincible Soviet army and the armies of the people's democracies, and stands firmly at its post defending the freedom of its people and world peace. The Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the heroic Korean People's Army in the just war against the American aggressors, have shown to all mankind the firm determination and fighting strength of the Chinese people and their army to defend the independence and prosperity of their powerful motherland and to defend the free life of the people.

Long live the ever-consolidating fighting alliance between our two peoples and two armies!

Glory to Mao Zedong, the great commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the wise mentor of the Chinese people! Glory to the great Stalin, the organizer of the struggle for world peace and human freedom!
