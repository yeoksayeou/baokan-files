    Hoping for an Introduction to Zhou Chuandian's Experience in Imparting Technology
    To the Editor: After reading the article "How I Transformed from a Worker into a Technician" published in the People's Daily on July 20th, I felt boundless excitement. This is the result of the Party and Chairman Mao's continuous cultivation and education of us workers. In the future, a large number of technical personnel will continuously emerge from among our workers. In order to rapidly disseminate the teaching experience of Technician Zhou Chuandian introduced in this article, I suggest that the People's Daily ask Technician Zhou to write an article specifically introducing his teaching experience, so as to provide learning material for the broad masses of engineering and technical personnel.  Li Fengshan

    Editor's Note: Comrade Li Fengshan's suggestion is very good. We have already asked Comrade Zhou Chuandian to write an article introducing his teaching experience.

    希望介绍周传典传授技术的经验
    编辑同志：我阅读了七月二十日人民日报刊载的“我是怎样由工人变成技术员的”文章后，感到无限的兴奋。这是党和毛主席不断培养和教育我们工人的结果。今后在我们工人中将会源源不断地出现大批的技术人员。为使这篇文章中所介绍的周传典技术员的教学经验迅速地传播出去，我建议人民日报请周技术员写一篇文章，专门介绍他的教学经验，以便给广大的工程技术人员学习。  李凤山
    编者按：李凤山同志的意见很好。我们已请周传典同志写一篇文章，把他的教学经验介绍出来。
