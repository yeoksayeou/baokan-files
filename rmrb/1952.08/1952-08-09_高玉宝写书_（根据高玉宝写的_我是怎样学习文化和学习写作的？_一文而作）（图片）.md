Gao Yu Bao Writes a Book
(Based on Gao Yu Bao's article "How I Learned Culture and Writing?")
Chen Xinghua, Painting

Twenty-eight. By December 1949, I had written my book several times. Section Chief Chi took it and read it for a long time, then happily said to me, "Very good, keep writing, learn from Paul Kochakin in Soviet novels." He then told me the story of "How the Steel Was Tempered," which gave me great encouragement.

Twenty-nine. In June 1950, I was transferred to the headquarters as a mail clerk. It was June weather, and I lived in a small house like a steamer belonging to the locals (the kitchen was outside the house). I wrote day and night, and I fainted several times.

Thirty. Soon after, the leaders and comrades of the division's political department all knew that I was writing a book. Everyone encouraged me to write well, gave me manuscript paper and pens, and Comrade Shang Zhenfan, the clerk, even copied it for me, which gave me even more courage.

Thirty-one. I just wrote and learned like this every day, and my cultural level also improved. In the past, I often used pictures to replace words, but now I don't need to draw anymore. Under the cultivation and education of the Party and the leading comrades, after more than a year, I finally completed the first draft of the novel, which was two to three hundred thousand words long. (The End)

    二十八、到一九四九年十二月，我的书已经写了好几回了。迟股长拿去看了半天，高兴地对我说：“很好，写吧，学习苏联小说中的保尔·柯察金。”他接着给我讲“钢铁是怎样炼成的”的故事，给我很大的鼓舞。
    二十九、一九五○年六月，我被调到司令部当收发员。正是六月天气，住在老乡的蒸笼一般的小房子里（房外就是厨房），白天黑夜都写书，我昏迷过好几次。
    三十、不久以后，师政治部的首长和同志们都知道我在写书。大家都鼓励我好好写，给我稿纸，又给我笔，文书尚振范同志还代我抄写，我就更有勇气了。
    三十一、我就这样天天写，天天学，文化也提高了。以前我常常用画代替字，现在再也不用画了。我在党和首长同志们的培养教育下，经过一年多的时间，算把二三十万字的小说初稿写成了。（完）
