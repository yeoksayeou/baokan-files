Xinhua News Agency Report: Tokyo Dispatch: On July 5th, the Japan Comprehensive Peace Treaty Patriotic Movement Council issued a statement regarding the Yoshida government's forced passage of the fascist "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" through the Diet, calling on the Japanese people to continue to fight for independence and peace, regardless of this repressive law.

The statement said: The "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" is a law that violates the constitution and oppresses the people's freedom, and therefore cannot be recognized as valid. The fact that the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan have forcibly established the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" precisely demonstrates their weakness. They no longer have confidence in being able to rule the people under the guise of "democracy," and therefore can only rely on direct suppression.

The statement pointed out: The power of the people throughout the country uniting to oppose the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" not only strikes at the reactionary forces at home and abroad, but also establishes the foundation for an anti-fascist united front.

The statement continued: If the working class and the people of all countries do not flinch at this malicious law, but rise up to oppose the stationing of U.S. troops, oppose police politics and restrictive trade policies (which are part of the U.S. imperialist war policy), and oppose the use of Japanese youth as mercenaries, and through these struggles establish a national united front, we believe that we will certainly be able to smash the repressive attempts of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and open a path toward independence, peace, and freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: Tokyo Dispatch: In response to the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Japanese Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions held an indoor mass rally at the Tokyo Skating Rink on the International Day of Solidarity with the Korean People and Defense of Peace (June 25th) to express international support for the Korean people. The rally was sponsored by the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, the Japan Peace Supporters' Committee, the Japan Comprehensive Peace Treaty Patriotic Movement Council, the Japan National Relief Association, the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, the Japan Stage Arts Workers Association, the United Democratic Front of Korean Residents in Japan, and other organizations.

Approximately five thousand people participated in the rally, and the venue was packed. The masses participating in the rally warmly welcomed the telegrams of support sent to the rally by the World Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions, and the Women's International Democratic Federation. The rally also received letters from many Japanese organizations.

The speeches by representatives of trade unions, farmers' organizations, and other democratic organizations at the rally greatly encouraged the determination of the masses participating in the rally to fight for peace, and especially for the immediate end to the Korean War.

The resolutions passed at the rally included: demanding an immediate halt to the Korean War and a ban on germ warfare in Korea; striving to get more people to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing; strengthening the peace movement month that began on June 25th to carry out the movement against the remilitarization of Japan; launching a movement to aid the Korean people who have suffered from war disasters; and promoting the movement to realize the Sino-Japanese trade agreement worth 60 million pounds.

    【新华社讯】东京迟到消息：七月五日，日本全面媾和爱国运动协议会就吉田政府强制国会通过法西斯的“防止破坏活动法”一事发表声明，号召日本人民不顾这个镇压性的法令，继续为独立与和平而斗争。
    声明说：“防止破坏活动法”是违反宪法、压迫人民自由的法令，因此也是不能被承认为有效的。美、日反动派强制成立“防止破坏活动法”正表示他们的脆弱。他们对于能够在“民主主义”的伪装下来统治人民这一点已经没有信心，因而只有依靠直接的镇压。
    声明指出：全国人民团结起来反对“防止破坏活动法”的力量不仅打击了国内外反动派，而且建立了反法西斯统一战线的基础。
    声明继续说：如果工人阶级和各国人民对这个恶毒的法令毫不畏缩，起来反对美军的驻扎，反对警察政治和限制贸易政策（这是美帝国主义战争政策的一部分），反对以日本青年为雇佣兵，通过这些斗争而建立起民族的统一战线，我们相信一定能够粉碎美、日反动派的镇压企图，打开走向独立、和平与自由的道路。
    【新华社十三日讯】东京迟到消息：世界工会联合会日本联络事务局为了响应世界工会联合会的号召，在国际积极声援朝鲜人民和保卫和平日（六月二十五日）在东京溜冰场召开了室内群众大会，表示对朝鲜人民的国际支援。大会得到了全日本产业别工会会议、日本拥护和平委员会、日本全面媾和爱国运动协议会、日本国民救援会、日苏亲善协会、日本舞台艺术工作者协会、朝鲜侨民统一民主战线等团体的赞助。
    参加大会的约有五千人，会场挤得满满的。参加大会的群众热烈地欢迎世界工会联合会、中华全国总工会、朝鲜职业总同盟、国际民主妇女联合会所打给大会的声援电。大会还收到日本许多团体的来信。
    工会、农民团体和其他民主团体的代表们在大会上的发言，大大鼓励了参加大会的群众为争取和平，特别是为立即结束朝鲜战争而斗争的决心。
    大会通过的决议包括：要求立即停止朝鲜战争，并禁止在朝鲜进行细菌战；努力使更多的人参加将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议；加强自六月二十五日开始的为开展反对日本重新军国主义化运动所举行的和平运动月；发动援救遭受战争灾害的朝鲜人民的运动；促进为实现价值六千万英镑的中日贸易协议的运动。
