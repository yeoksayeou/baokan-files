The Central Trade Department stipulates the new cotton purchase prices for this year.

    In order to control seasonal price differences in cotton, protect the interests of cotton farmers, and based on the price level of this autumn and the spirit of the cotton-grain price ratio announced by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government on March 12 this year, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has now stipulated the new cotton purchase prices for this year (the new cotton purchase price list will be issued separately). It has also been decided that these regulations will be implemented starting from September 1st. To this end, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has issued instructions, ordering local trade administrative departments and cotton, yarn, and cloth companies to make reasonable adjustments to new cotton prices within their respective regions based on this spirit, and to announce them in advance, so that cotton farmers can sell their old cotton in a timely manner at the current higher prices. The instructions point out: It should be fully explained to cotton farmers that the new cotton prices can guarantee the cotton-grain price ratio standard. The instructions also require cotton, yarn, and cloth companies and cooperatives in various regions to widely organize mobile teams to go deep into the countryside to publicize and mobilize, and to purchase in a timely and vigorous manner, to ensure the interests of cotton farmers. The instructions specifically point out: Last year, a small number of cotton farmers in some areas, in order to sell at high prices before September 1st, mixed unripe and undried cotton bolls into old cotton for sale. This year, attention must be paid to prevent such behavior that is detrimental to production and harms the interests of the country and the people.
    The new cotton purchase prices in major cotton-producing areas, markets, and textile production cities are as follows:
    (Unit: Yuan per catty of 7/8-inch medium-grade fine lint) Shanghai 9400 yuan Tianjin 8900 yuan Qingdao 8900 yuan
    (The above are all bale prices) Hankou 8400 yuan Xi'an 8050 yuan Jinan 8400 yuan Beijing 8600 yuan Baoding 8250 yuan Shijiazhuang 8100 yuan Linqing 8100 yuan Xinxiang 8100 yuan Zhengzhou 8150 yuan Taiyuan 8100 yuan Yuncheng 8050 yuan Dezhou 8250 yuan
    (The above are all loose cotton prices)

    中央贸易部规定今年新棉收购价格
    中央人民政府贸易部为掌握棉花季节差价，保护棉农利益，并根据今年秋季物价水平及中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会本年三月十二日公布的棉粮比价精神，现已规定出今年新棉收购价格（新棉收购牌价另发）。并决定此项规定于九月一日起开始执行。为此，中央人民政府贸易部已发出指示，责成各地贸易行政部门和花纱布公司本此精神，将区内新棉价格作合理调整，并预先公布，以便棉农按照目前较高价格及时出售陈棉。指示中指出：应充分向棉农说明，新棉价格能够保证棉粮比价标准。指示中并要求各地花纱布公司和合作社，广泛组织流动小组，深入农村，宣传动员，及时大力收购，以保证棉农利益，指示中特别指出：去年有少数地区棉农，为赶在九月一日前高价出售，将未成熟和未晒干的剥桃新棉掺在陈棉内出卖，对这种不利于生产，损害国家人民利益的行为，今年必须注意防止。
    各主要产棉区市场及纺织生产城市新棉收购牌价如下：
    （单位：每市斤7／8吋中级细绒）上海  九四○○元  天津  八九○○元青岛  八九○○元
