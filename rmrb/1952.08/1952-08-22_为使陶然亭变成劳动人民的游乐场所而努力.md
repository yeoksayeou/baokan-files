To the Editor: My name is Yi An, and I am the abbot of the "Taoranting" and "South Guanyin Temple" outside Guang'anmen in Beijing. In April of this year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government began environmental sanitation improvement work in the Taoranting area. After more than four months, Taoranting has been transformed. Looking at it now and thinking about the past, my heart is filled with emotion.

Taoranting used to be a place of enjoyment for reactionary rulers and exploiters. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Taoranting was repeatedly occupied by the Chiang bandit army and repeatedly damaged. They relentlessly extorted "sanitation fees," "ditch repair donations," and "road repair donations" from the Taoranting abbot, but never saw any repairs done.奸商 (conniving merchants) would hoard ice formed from the foul and filthy water of the ditches in this area during the winter, storing it in cellars and selling it in the summer. How much harm this did to the health of the city's people! After liberation, Taoranting finally saw the light of day. The People's Government banned the conniving merchants from hoarding ice here to harm people. The disgustingly filthy Taoranting is now about to be transformed into a beautiful and truly scenic spot. I once stated that we would sincerely donate land near Taoranting belonging to the temple if it was needed for public construction. However, the People's Government gave us a huge subsidy in return for the land used for public buildings. In addition to supporting all the measures of the People's Government, we will invest a portion of this subsidy in production and another portion as expenses for renovating the Taoranting buildings, to do our best to make Taoranting a recreational place for the working people.

    为使陶然亭变成劳动人民的游乐场所而努力
    编辑同志：我叫义安，是北京“陶然亭”和广安门外“南观音寺”两个庙的住持和尚。今年四月间，北京市人民政府在陶然亭一带开始了改善环境卫生的工作，经过四个多月，陶然亭变样了。我看看现在，想想过去，心中无限感慨。
    陶然亭过去一直是反动统治者和剥削者们享乐的地方。在国民党反动统治时期，陶然亭屡被蒋匪军占用，并屡遭破坏。他们向陶然亭住持人苛刻地不断地索取“卫生费”、“修沟捐”、“修道捐”等等，但从未见修理过什么。奸商们则在冬天把这一带的臭沟秽水所凝成的冰设窖屯起来，到夏天出售，这对全市人民的健康危害多大！解放后，陶然亭也见了青天。人民政府取缔了奸商们在这里屯冰害人的勾当。污秽得令人作呕的陶然亭，眼看将修成美丽的、名符其实的风景区了。我曾经表示过，在陶然亭附近属于寺庙所有的地，如为公共建筑所需要，我们当竭诚捐献。但是，公共建筑物用去的地，人民政府还给了我们巨额的补助费。我们除了拥护人民政府的一切措施外，将把这笔补助费的一部分投入生产，另一部分作为修整陶然亭房屋的用费，为陶然亭变成一个劳动人民游乐的场所而尽我们最大的努力。
