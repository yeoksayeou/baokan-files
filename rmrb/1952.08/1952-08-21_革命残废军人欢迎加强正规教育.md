    Revolutionary Disabled Veterans Welcome Strengthened Formal Education

    Editor: As the 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day approached, newspapers in various places successively published the "Decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on Strengthening Formal Education in Schools for Revolutionary Disabled Veterans." When the students of our Hubei Honored Soldiers School saw this decision, they were all very happy. Sun Changyuan, whose one leg is disabled, was so happy when he saw this decision that he didn't even bother to pick up his crutches, and hopped and skipped to the class to tell his comrades. Fan Ming'ao, who has a low level of education but a high enthusiasm for learning, said: "I have the opportunity to receive education now. I believe that I can continue to serve the people, and I want to contribute my strength." Fu Delin said: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's good leadership, how could we learn culture and have the opportunity for further study!" Sheng Yunlong, who has lofty ideals, said: "Since the day I became disabled and could no longer return to the battlefield, I have been determined to improve my education and learn technology, hoping to become a tractor driver in the future and participate in the construction of the motherland. Now that we have the opportunity to receive formal education, my hope can be realized even more." Everyone has a common idea: not only could they use guns to eliminate the enemy in the past, but more importantly, they hope that they will be able to master machines to serve the construction of the motherland in the future. In the past, our school also had the phenomenon of emphasizing support over education, and everyone hopes that this can be corrected in the implementation of this decision.

    In addition, we also have a suggestion, hoping that the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government will send someone to revolutionary disabled veterans schools across the country within a certain period to understand the actual teaching situation, and convey and introduce the teaching experiences of various places. Doing so will be helpful for the work.

    革命残废军人欢迎加强正规教育
    编辑同志：“八一”建军节二十五周年纪念日到来时，各地报纸上都先后刊载了中央人民政府政务院“关于加强革命残废军人学校正规教育的决定”。我们湖北荣誉军人学校的学员在看到这个决定时，都非常高兴。一条腿残废了的孙长远看到这个决定时，高兴得连拐棍都来不及拿，便连跳带蹦地跑到班里告诉同志们。文化程度较低而学习热情极高的樊明璈说：“我有了受教育的机会了。我相信我能够继续为人民服务，我要贡献出我的力量来。”傅德林说：“要不是毛主席领导得好，咱们那能学文化，那有深造的机会啊！”有着远大理想的盛云龙说：“自从我变成残废、不能重上战场的那天起，我便决心提高文化，学习技术，希望将来成为一个拖拉机手，参加祖国建设。如今，我们有受正规教育的机会，我的希望更能实现了。”大家有一个共同的想法：不但过去自己能拿枪杆消灭敌人，更重要的是希望自己将来能掌握机器为祖国建设服务。以前，我们的学校也有重养不重教的现象，大家都希望在实施这个决定中能够改正。
    另外，我们还有个建议，希望中央人民政府政务院在一定时期内派专人到全国各地革命残废军人学校来了解一下实际教学情况，并传达和介绍各地的教学经验。这样做对工作是有帮助的。
