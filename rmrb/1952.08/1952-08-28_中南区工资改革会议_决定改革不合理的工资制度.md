The recently held Central South Region Wage Reform Conference decided to reform the unreasonable wage systems in state-owned, public-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-operated industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in the Central South Region. Based on the current situation where average advanced quotas have not yet been set for various factories and mines, and technical operating procedures are not yet perfect, making it difficult to implement a new piece-rate wage system, the conference decided to implement the eight-grade wage system. It also decided to increase the total wage bill by approximately 150 million catties of rice compared to the original, in order to carry out reforms on the basis of generally not lowering wages.

Although wage systems in state-owned, public-owned, and joint state-private factories and mines in the Central South Region have been adjusted in the past three years, the unreasonable wage systems left over from old enterprises have not been fundamentally changed. Wage standards in various factories and mines are extremely chaotic, and there is a widespread unreasonable phenomenon of unequal pay for equal work, light industry being higher than heavy industry, ordinary workers being higher than technical workers, and general staff being higher than technical staff; most factories and mines also implement an egalitarian multi-grade wage system, with some having as many as thirteen grades and thirty-nine levels, or even more than one hundred levels. All these outdated wage systems seriously hinder the enthusiasm of workers to improve their labor skills. The implementation of this conference's decision will change the above-mentioned unreasonable phenomena, encourage workers to improve their skills, promote production development, and appropriately improve the lives of workers. It is estimated that more than 80 percent of workers will receive wage increases in this wage reform.

This conference was jointly convened by the Financial and Economic Committee, the Industrial Department, the Labor Department of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee, and the Preparatory Committee of the Central South Federation of Trade Unions. Attendees included heads of relevant departments, responsible cadres of Party, government, labor union, and Youth League organizations from various factories and mines, workshop directors, production team leaders, and worker representatives. In order to effectively implement the eight-grade wage system, representatives from various regions studied and discussed several relevant documents for twenty-four days during the conference, clearly recognizing the importance of the wage reform work. The conference made profound criticisms of certain erroneous views that neglected mastering technical standards and not proceeding from the development of production in the discussion of wage reform work, as well as egalitarianism. Before the conference, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee had systematically trained a large number of cadres to carry out wage reform work and gained experience from pilot projects in several factories and mines, making full preparations for large-scale wage reform work.

Xinhua News Agency: The Preparatory Committee of the Central South Federation of Trade Unions recently instructed trade union organizations at all levels to actively mobilize the masses of workers to participate in wage reform work, and at the same time actively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, so as to repay the deep concern of the Communist Party and the People's Government for the lives of workers with practical actions to strengthen national defense construction and economic construction.

    中南区工资改革会议
    决定改革不合理的工资制度
    最近举行的中南区工资改革会议决定改革中南区国营、公营、公私合营及合作社经营的工矿、交通企业中不合理的工资制度。会议根据目前各厂矿平均先进定额尚未订出、技术操作规程还不完善，一时难于推行新的计件工资的实际情况，决定贯彻执行八级工资制，并决定把工资总额比原来增加一亿五千万斤大米左右，以便在一般不降低工资的基础上进行改革。
    中南区各国营、公营和公私合营厂矿企业的工资制度过去三年中虽曾进行过调整，但旧企业遗留下来的不合理的工资制度并未根本改变。各厂矿工资标准十分混乱，普遍存在着同工不同酬、轻工业高于重工业、普通工人高于技术工人、一般职员高于技术职员等轻重倒置的不合理现象；大多数厂矿还实行着平均主义的多级工资制，有的竟多至十三等三十九级以至一百多级。所有这些陈腐的工资制度严重地妨碍了职工们提高劳动技术的热情。这次会议的决定实施以后，将改变上述不合理的现象，鼓舞职工提高技术，促进生产发展，并使职工的生活得到适当改善。据估计，在这次工资改革中增加工资的职工将占百分之八十以上。
    这次会议是由中南军政委员会财政经济委员会、工业部、劳动部和中南总工会筹备委员会联合召开的。出席会议的代表有各有关部门负责人，以及各厂矿党、政、工、团负责干部、车间主任、生产小组长和职工代表。为了切实贯彻实行八级工资制，会议期间各地代表曾就若干有关文件进行了二十四天的学习和讨论，明确认识了工资改革工作的重要性。会议对某些在讨论工资改革工作中忽视掌握技术标准、不从发展生产出发的错误观点和平均主义思想作了深刻的批判。会议之前，中南军政委员会财政经济委员会，曾有计划地训练了大批进行工资改革工作的干部，并在若干厂矿试点工作中吸取经验，为大规模的工资改革工作作了充分准备。
    中南总工会筹备委员会最近指示各级工会组织积极发动职工群众参加工资改革工作，同时积极开展增产节约运动，以加强国防建设和经济建设的实际行动来答谢共产党和人民政府对于职工生活的深切关怀。　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
