    Wang Yejun Successfully Designs and Produces an Alum Mixer
    Editor: In recent years, the water supply of the Shanghai Pudong Water Plant has only been 21% of its designed water production capacity. This is because the design of the alum mixing section in the sedimentation tank is flawed, which greatly restricts the water production capacity. Wang Yejun, a technician at the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Water Supply Management Office, after three months of research, designed and produced an alum mixer. Since the plant adopted the alum mixer, the sedimentation time has been reduced from six hours to two and a half hours, greatly increasing the water supply capacity. This improvement can save the country a large amount of wealth every year.
    The successful design of the alum mixer is an innovation in China and makes a great contribution to the water supply industry. It is suitable for all small and medium-sized water plants and can be adopted by water plants throughout China. Zhang Jixuan

    王业俊设计和矾机成功
    编辑同志：上海市浦东自来水厂近年来供水量仅为其应制水能力的百分之二十一。这是因为沉淀池内和矾部分的设计不良，制水能力因而大受限制。上海市公用局给水管理处技正王业俊，经过三个月的钻研，设计成一架和矾机。这个厂自采用了和矾机，沉淀时间已由六小时减到二小时半，使供水能力大大提高，这个改进每年可为国家节省大量财富。
    和矾机的设计成功，在中国尚属创举，对给水事业有很大贡献。它适用于一切中小型水厂，我国各地水厂都可以采用。张记轩
