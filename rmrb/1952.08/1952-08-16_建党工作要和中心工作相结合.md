Party Building Work Must Be Integrated with Central Tasks
The former CPC Committee of the Northern Sichuan Region issued a circular to the entire region regarding the experience of the Lanjiang Township Branch in organizing all township farmers to carry out a patriotic production increase competition. The circular pointed out: (1) Party building work must be closely integrated with the current patriotic production increase movement; (2) It is necessary to give play to the leading and guaranteeing role of Party organizations in the patriotic production increase movement. This is entirely correct. Experience has proven that every large-scale movement creates conditions for Party building; the development of Party building work, in turn, promotes the movement and consolidates the victory of the movement.

Judging from materials from several regions, the Party organizations in most regions have paid attention to carrying out Party building work during the movement. However, the Party organizations and some Party cadres in a few regions have not paid enough attention to this, or have not paid attention to it at all. As a result, they have adopted a passive attitude towards Party building work in large-scale movements. For example, they only do general propaganda on Party building work, and do not conduct practical investigation and training of activists; some even hand over the propaganda work related to Party building to the Communist Youth League members, while they themselves do not do it. Undoubtedly, these people do not understand that Party building work should be carried out in large-scale movements, and that this is a serious political task.

Our country is about to embark on a large-scale economic construction endeavor. To ensure the complete victory of this endeavor, many conditions are needed, the most basic of which is the strong leadership of the Party. Taking the countryside as an example, there must be strong Party leadership to gradually transform the individual economy of farmers into collectivized large-scale production. From this, it can be seen that building a strong and powerful Party is related to the entire future of the country. If a Party organization or a Party member regards such a serious political task as a secondary task, then they are adopting an irresponsible attitude towards our national construction endeavor.

Some cadres also say that Party building work and central work cannot be carried out at the same time, so they abandon or relax Party building work in central work. These comrades do not understand that Party building work must be carried out in the process of central work. They also do not understand that it is precisely in the process of carrying out central work that a large number of activists can emerge and the political consciousness of activists can be effectively improved. Therefore, as long as we consciously pay attention to discovering and educating advanced elements in the movement as targets for developing the Party, and then provide them with training in batches after the movement comes to an end, we can admit a batch of activists who meet the conditions of Party members into the Party. In this way, the victory of the movement will be further consolidated, and a foundation will be laid for the next movement.

### 建党工作要和中心工作相结合

    建党工作要和中心工作相结合
    原川北区党委曾就拦江乡支部组织全乡农民开展爱国增产竞赛运动的经验，向全区发出通报。在通报中指出了：（一）建党工作必须和当前的爱国增产运动紧密地结合进行；（二）要发挥党组织在爱国增产运动中的领导作用和保证作用。这是完全正确的。经验证明，每一次大规模的运动都为建党创造了条件；建党工作的开展又推进了运动，巩固了运动的胜利。
    从若干地区的材料来看，绝大部分地区的党的组织都注意了在运动中进行建党工作。但是也有少数地区的党的组织和部分党员干部，对此重视不够，或者根本不重视，因而他们在大规模的运动中，对于建党工作采取了消极的态度。例如只作建党工作的一般宣传，而不对积极分子进行切实的考察和培养工作；甚至还有把有关建党的宣传工作交给青年团员去作，而自己不作的。无疑问的，这些人不懂得在大规模的运动中正应该进行建党工作，这是一个严重的政治任务。
    我们的国家即将开始大规模的经济建设事业。要保证这一事业取得完全的胜利，就要有许多条件，其中最基本的条件就是党的坚强的领导。就以农村说，必须有党的坚强领导，才能逐步地使农民个体经济改变为集体化的大生产。由此可以看出，建设一个强大有力的党，关系着国家的整个前途。假如一个党的组织，一个党员，把这样严重的政治任务，当作了一个次要的工作，那就是对我们的国家建设事业采取了不负责任的态度。
    也有部分干部说建党工作和中心工作不能同时进行，因而他们在中心工作中放弃或放松了建党工作。这些同志不了解，建党工作必须在中心工作的过程中去进行。他们也不了解，正是在进行中心工作中才能大量涌现积极分子，并有效地提高积极分子的政治觉悟。因此只要我们有意识地在运动中注意发现和教育先进分子，作为发展党的对象，而在运动告一段落后，又分批予以训练，即可接收一批具备党员的条件的积极分子入党。这样，运动的胜利就会更加巩固，并且也为下一步的运动奠立了基础。
