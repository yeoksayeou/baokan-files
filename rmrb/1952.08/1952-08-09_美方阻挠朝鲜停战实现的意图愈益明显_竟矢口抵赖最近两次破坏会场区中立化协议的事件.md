Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 8th. Today, the US side adopted an even more barbaric and unreasonable attitude of denial towards the two recent incidents of sabotaging the neutralization agreement of the Panmunjom meeting area. At a liaison officer meeting held this afternoon, US liaison officer Robinson groundlessly denied that a US aircraft flew over the meeting area on August 4, and once again refused to conduct a joint investigation into the US shelling of the meeting area on August 2. Our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, rebuked the US side's irresponsible and evasive attitude, and pointed out that no matter how the US side tries to evade responsibility, they cannot deny the established facts.

When the US aircraft flew over the meeting area three times on August 4, the weather was clear and visibility was good. Each time, our security police requested the US security police to conduct a joint observation, but the US security police blatantly refused. But today, Robinson arbitrarily said that our protest "has no valid basis." Regarding the incident of the US shelling of the meeting area for as long as three hours on August 2, the security officers of both sides saw and heard many witnesses and material evidences recorded in the joint investigation. However, the US side attempted to deny responsibility. We requested a joint investigation by the liaison officers of both sides, but the US side repeatedly evaded it. On the 6th, the US liaison officer made the excuse of "reviewing the records of the incident," and today he made the excuse of "preparing a reply."

People in Kaesong pointed out that when all sixty-three clauses of the draft armistice agreement have been agreed upon and the end of bloodshed is near, the US representatives are refusing to fulfill clauses 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement, which stipulate the principles for repatriation of prisoners of war, and insisting on a long recess; outside the meeting, they are creating provocative incidents, and adopting the old trick of denying responsibility and refusing to conduct investigations, which the US side used last August to create incidents and force the negotiations to stop. The US side's intention to obstruct the realization of the armistice is extremely obvious.

    美方阻挠朝鲜停战实现的意图愈益明显
    竟矢口抵赖最近两次破坏会场区中立化协议的事件
    【新华社开城八日电】美方今天对最近两次破坏板门店会场区中立化协议的事件，采取了更加横蛮无理的抵赖态度。在下午举行的一次联络官会议上，美方联络官罗宾逊毫无根据地否认八月四日美机飞越会场区，并再度拒绝对八月二日美方炮击会场区事件进行共同调查。我方首席联络官张春山上校斥责美方不负责任与推诿的态度，并指出：不论美方怎样设法逃避责任，他们也抵赖不掉确定的事实。
    八月四日美机三次飞越会场区时，天气晴朗，清晰可见。每次我方安全警察都要求美方安全警察进行共同观察，美方安全警察却悍然拒绝。而今天罗宾逊竟武断地说我方抗议“没有有效的根据”。关于八月二日美方炮轰会场区先后达三小时之久的事件，双方安全军官在共同调查中曾看到并听到记录在案的许多人证、物证。但美方却企图抵赖责任。我方要求双方联络官进行共同调查，而美方却一再逃避。六日美方联络官藉口说要“复查事件记录”，今天又托辞说“正在准备答复”。
    开城人士指出：当全部停战协定草案的六十三款都已达成协议、流血的终止近在咫尺的时候，美方代表却在会内拒绝履行规定遣俘原则的停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款，坚持长期休会；在会外，他们制造挑衅事件，并且采取了去年八月美方制造事件迫使谈判停顿时的矢口抵赖责任、拒绝进行调查的故技。美方阻挠停战实现的意图极其明显。
