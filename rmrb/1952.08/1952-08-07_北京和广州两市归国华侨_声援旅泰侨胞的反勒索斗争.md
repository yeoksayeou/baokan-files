Xinhua News Agency Report: The spokespersons of the Beijing Overseas Chinese Friendship Association and the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Friendship Association respectively issued statements and protest letters, supporting the petition movement of the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Thailand demanding a reduction in the "Foreigner's Personal Identity Certificate Fee," and strongly protested against the Thai government's brutal persecution and extortion of our overseas Chinese. The spokesperson of the Beijing Overseas Chinese Friendship Association pointed out that over 90% of foreigners in Thailand are overseas Chinese; the Thai government's unreasonable measure of increasing the "Foreigner's Personal Identity Certificate Fee" by twenty times is a barbaric means to plunder large amounts of money from overseas Chinese to make up for its fiscal deficit caused by following the United States' policy of arms expansion and war preparation, and to conspire to force our overseas Chinese who are unable to pay the "Fee" to serve as coolies, and even as cannon fodder for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan and the American aggressors. The Thai government's brutal persecution and extortion of our overseas Chinese must be stopped immediately, otherwise, it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

The protest letter from the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Friendship Association stated: Regarding the Thai government's unreasonable persecution and extortion, He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of our Central People's Government, has issued a protest statement, and the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Thailand have also launched a petitioning and reasoning movement. The majority of the 3.5 million overseas Chinese in Thailand are originally from Guangdong. We, the returned overseas Chinese and their families in Guangzhou, firmly support Director He's statement and the reasonable demands of the overseas Chinese in Thailand. We demand that the Thai government immediately stop the persecution and extortion of overseas Chinese.

    北京和广州两市归国华侨
    声援旅泰侨胞的反勒索斗争
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：北京归国华侨联谊会发言人和广州市归国华侨联谊会筹备会分别发表谈话和抗议书，支持泰国广大华侨要求减低“外侨随身证例费”的请愿运动，并严重抗议泰国政府对我国侨胞的残暴的迫害和勒索行为。北京归国华侨联谊会发言人指出：在泰外侨百分之九十以上为华侨；泰国政府提高“外侨随身证例费”达二十倍的无理措施，是要以这种蛮横手段从华侨身上掠夺大批钱财，以弥补其由于追随美国的扩军备战政策而产生的财政赤字，并阴谋强迫无力缴纳“例费”的我国侨胞充当苦工，甚至充当台湾蒋匪帮和美国侵略者的炮灰。泰国政府对我侨胞的这种残暴的迫害和勒索行为，必须立即停止，否则，就须对因此而起的一切后果负完全责任。
    广州市归国华侨联谊会筹备会的抗议书中说：对于泰国政府的无理迫害和勒索，我中央人民政府华侨事务委员会何香凝主任委员已发表抗议声明，旅泰广大华侨也展开了请愿说理运动。泰国三百五十多万华侨大部分原籍广东，我们广州市的归国华侨、侨眷坚决支持何主任委员的声明和旅泰侨胞的合理要求，我们要求泰国政府立即停止对华侨的迫害和勒索行为。
