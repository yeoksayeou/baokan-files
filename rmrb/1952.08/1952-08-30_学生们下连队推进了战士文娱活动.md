    Students Going to Companies Promotes Soldiers' Recreational Activities
    Editor: All the students of Class 27 of the Beijing Russian Language School came to our unit on August 13 to teach the soldiers singing and group dances, and prepared many wonderful programs for the soldiers. Some students said, "Helping soldiers carry out recreational activities makes everyone of us very happy. Our enthusiasm is higher and our energy is greater than when doing any other work." Some said, "We have two purposes in going to the company: on the one hand, to help the soldiers carry out recreational activities, and on the other hand, to learn the soldiers' fine qualities and simple style." However, that day it suddenly rained, and the students braved the rain and walked the muddy roads to the company's residence. The students went to each class to talk with the soldiers, teach them songs and dance scores. They also performed programs for the soldiers under the gate, which was very popular with the soldiers. Before the program was finished, the class bell rang. The soldiers wanted to finish watching, and the students were also willing to continue performing. However, the class bell kept ringing, and the students thought that in order not to affect the soldiers' studies, they had to stop here. The students stood on the road, the soldiers stood on the side of the road, looking at each other, reluctant to part, and shouted slogans: "Learn from the students, wish the students good health!" "Learn from the soldiers, thank the soldiers for their concern for us!" The applause was thunderous. The two sides looked at each other for a long time, and finally made up their minds before separating.
    After the students came to our unit, they greatly promoted our recreational activities. The soldiers are happily dancing the various dances taught by the students every day. We are very grateful to the students for their help. In the future, we will definitely respond to the students with our work and study achievements.

    学生们下连队推进了战士文娱活动
    编辑同志：北京俄文专修学校二十七班全体同学，于八月十三日来我部队教战士们唱歌和集体舞蹈，并准备了很多的精彩节目为战士们演出。有的同学说：“帮助战士开展文娱活动，我们每个人都很高兴，比做什么工作情绪都高，劲头都大。”有的说：“我们下连队有两个目的：一方面帮助战士们开展文娱活动，另一方面我们要学习战士们的优良品质及淳朴作风。”但是，那天骤然间下了雨，同学们就冒着雨，踏着泥泞的道路，到连队的驻地。同学们到各班与战士们座谈、教唱舞谱。并在大门洞底下给战士们演出节目，很受战士欢迎。节目还未演完，上课哨响起啦。战士们很想看完，同学们也很愿继续演完。但是，上课哨在不停地响着，同学们又想到为了不影响战士们的学习，到此只好停止。同学们站在马路上，战士们站在路旁，互相对视，恋恋不舍，双方呼起了口号：“向同学们学习，祝同学们身体健康！”“向战士们学习，感谢战士们对我们的关怀！”掌声如雷。双方对视了很长时间，最后都下了决心，才分别啦。
    同学们来到我部之后，把我们的文娱活动向前推动了一大步，战士们每天都在愉快地跳着同学们教的各种舞蹈。我们很感谢同学们对我们的帮助。今后一定以我们的工作、学习成绩来回答同学们。
