    Leading Cadres in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, Should Correct Their Views on the Patriotic Health Campaign
    Liang Xiu
    Our patriotic health campaign has been launched nationwide and has achieved great results. However, we must also note that some places and units still do not recognize the importance of health work and adopt a passive and indifferent attitude towards it. Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, is a prominent example in this regard.
    Nearly 80 percent of the population of Yangquan City are workers. In such a city, doing a good job in health work and ensuring the health of workers should be a very important task for guaranteeing and promoting the patriotic production increase and economy campaign. However, the patriotic health campaign in Yangquan City is not doing well. In early July, I went to Yangquan to inspect the health work. Although the organization leading the health campaign here has been established, it is only an empty shell. The leading organs push the health work to the hospital. The higher authorities instructed that a concentrated effort be made in health work in May, but Yangquan City had not yet taken action by the beginning of July. The environmental hygiene of the urban area and the industrial and mining areas is very poor. For example, there are no water wells in the mining area. Workers at the Fifth Mine use coal buckets to transport water from ponds and then pour it into a pool for everyone to drink. There are more than 1,000 workers in Xiaonankeng, but only a small water pit less than two feet deep and one meter square. Everyone draws water there to drink, and livestock also drink there. There are no suitable toilets in the mining area, and people defecate everywhere. Garbage piles can be seen everywhere in the city, and corners and backs are full of excrement. There are many flies. Food stalls are not managed. Unhygienic cold food, especially "liangfen" sold in raw water and exposed to air and dust, is very popular. The kitchen of the Xiaonankeng Mine is very small and there is no place to eat. After eating, the workers take their bowls and chopsticks back to the dormitory and throw them casually on the windowsill, bed, or under the bed. Some bowls still have leftover food.
    Because of this lack of attention to health work, many people in Yangquan City are sick this summer. Half of the workers in Xiaonankeng Mine have been sick. Almost all the staff of one district government have fallen ill.
    Why is this serious situation created? I think the most important reason is that the leading cadres in Yangquan City do not have a correct view of the patriotic health campaign. First, they emphasize that carrying out the patriotic health campaign is in conflict with production. One leading cadre said: "Production comes first, and two central tasks cannot be carried out at the same time, so the health campaign cannot be carried out." They did not see that the patriotic health campaign is precisely to serve production. I calculated for them that 500 workers in Xiaonankeng Mine were sick this summer. If each person was sick for an average of five days, 2,500 working days would be lost. What a huge loss this is to production! Second, they emphasize material difficulties, and when it comes to the health campaign, they complain about insufficient funding, but they do not do cleaning and sanitation, health education for workers, and other work that does not cost money. I interviewed some workers who did not even know the "Four Cleans and Five Eliminations" (people clean, home clean, courtyard clean, street clean; eliminate flies, eliminate lice, eliminate fleas, eliminate mosquitoes, eliminate rats) slogan proposed by Shanxi Province. No one has called them to meetings to talk about the patriotic health campaign, and no one has organized them to do health work. Some people eat unhygienic food and drink cold water casually, and no one has educated them. The chairman of the Xiaonankeng Mine Trade Union said: "The workers work for eight hours a day, and mobilizing them to do cleaning and sanitation work is increasing their burden." The result of their "caring for the workers" is that many workers become ill, causing damage to their health and work.
    After the inspection, Xiaonankeng Mine has begun to dig wells, build toilets, and improve health work, which is very good, but this alone cannot completely solve the problem. I hope that the leading cadres in Yangquan City will first correct their erroneous views on the patriotic health campaign, strengthen their leadership over health work, pay attention to propaganda and education, and mobilize the masses, so that health work can be done well.

    山西阳泉市的领导干部应改正对爱国卫生运动的看法
    梁秀
    我们的爱国卫生运动已在全国范围内展开，并已取得了伟大的成绩。可是另一方面我们不能不注意到，有一些地方和单位一直到现在仍然不认识卫生工作的重要性，对这一工作采取消极和冷淡的态度。山西省阳泉市在这方面就是一个突出的例子。
    阳泉市的人口中将近百分之八十是工人。在这样一个城市中，做好卫生工作，保障工人健康，对于保证和推动爱国增产节约运动，应该是一件十分重要的工作。可是阳泉市的爱国卫生运动做得很不好。七月初，我到阳泉检查卫生工作。这里领导卫生运动的机构虽然成立了，可是只有空架子。领导机关把卫生工作往医院推。上级指示要在五月份突击卫生工作，可是阳泉市到了七月初还没有动。市区和工矿区的环境卫生情况非常恶劣。例如矿区没有水井，第五矿的工人用煤斗运来池水，再倒在一个池子里供大家饮用。小南坑有一千多工人，只有一个不到二尺深、一公尺见方的小水坑，大家在那里打水喝，也在那儿饮牲口。矿区没有合适的厕所，大家随地大便。市内到处可见垃圾堆，墙角背处满布大便。苍蝇很多。饮食摊贩未加管理。不卫生的冷食，特别是放在生水里、暴露在空气、尘埃中出卖的“凉粉”很盛行。小南坑矿的厨房很小，没有吃饭场所。工人吃过饭之后把碗筷带回宿舍，随手扔在窗台上、床上或床底下，有的碗里还有剩菜剩饭。
    因为这样不重视卫生工作，阳泉市今年夏天病人很多。小南坑矿有半数工人发过病。一个区政府的人员几乎全部病倒了。
    为什么会造成这样严重的情况呢？我认为最重要的原因是阳泉市领导干部对爱国卫生运动的看法不正确。首先，他们强调开展爱国卫生运动和生产矛盾。某一个领导干部说：“生产第一，不能同时进行两个中心工作，所以卫生运动没法搞。”他们没有看到爱国卫生运动正是为生产服务的。我替他们计算了一下，小南坑矿今年夏天有五百工人患病，如果平均每人病五天，就损失了二千五百个劳动日。这对生产是多么大的一项损失！第二，他们强调物质困难，一讲到卫生运动就埋怨经费不够，而对于清洁打扫、向工人进行卫生教育等这些不要花钱的工作也不做。我访问过一些工人，他们连山西省提出的“四净五灭”（人净、家净、院净、街净；灭蝇、灭虱、灭蚤、灭蚊、灭鼠）口号也不知道，没有人召集他们开过会谈爱国卫生运动，也没有组织起来搞卫生工作。有的人随便吃不卫生的东西、喝凉水，也没有人向他们进行过教育。小南坑矿的工会主席说：“工人一天劳动了八小时，再发动他们搞清洁卫生工作是增加他们的负担。”他们这样“爱护工人”的结果，是使许多工人生病，使工人的健康和工作都受到损失。
    检查之后，小南坑矿已开始打水井、修厕所，改进卫生工作，这是很好的，但光是这样还不能彻底解决问题。我希望阳泉市的领导干部首先改正对爱国卫生运动的错误看法，加强对卫生工作的领导，注意进行宣传教育，发动群众，这样才能把卫生工作搞好。
