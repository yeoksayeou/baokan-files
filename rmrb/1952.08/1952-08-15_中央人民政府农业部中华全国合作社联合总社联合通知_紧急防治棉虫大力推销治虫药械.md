Joint Notice from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives:
Urgently Prevent and Control Cotton Pests and Vigorously Promote Insecticide and Machinery
    Currently, cotton aphids and spider mites are widespread in Liaodong, Liaoxi, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei and other provinces, and the scope of damage is expanding daily. In Liaoxi Province alone, the affected area has reached more than 200,000 hectares, and in Hebei Province, according to incomplete statistics, there are more than 3 million mu. Other pests such as thrips, mirid bugs, weevils, leaf rollers, cotton bollworms, and pink bollworms are also occurring successively in various places, spreading rapidly and seriously hindering the growth of cotton.
    According to reports from various places, most areas are carrying out pest control campaigns in a timely manner and actively completing the task of promoting the sale of pesticides and machinery. For example, Liaoxi Province has sold more than 90% of its pesticides and machinery; Jiaozhou Prefecture in Shandong has sold out its original pesticides and machinery and has transferred supplies from other places; Dingxian Prefecture in Hebei Province has sold more than 7,000 sprayers. However, there are still a few areas that have not yet launched pest control campaigns and are stockpiling large quantities of pesticides and machinery. For example, in Hebei Province, the sale of cotton oil soap accounts for only one-tenth of the prepared quantity, tobacco leaves and sulfur each only one-fiftieth, and sprayers only one-fourth, which greatly affects the progress of cotton pest control work. These situations show that there are still many problems in our pest control and pesticide/machinery promotion work.
    1. Some leading cadres have blindly optimistic ideas about pest control work. For example, some county and district leaders in Liaodong Province believe that "cotton seedlings are large, honey dew isn't bad," and "the next rain will wash them away," so they are not actively mobilizing the masses to seize the time to spray pesticides for prevention and control when the pest damage is light; instead, they let things drift and lack strong organizational leadership.
    2. Cooperatives have failed to actively promote the sale of pesticides and machinery. Some cadres of higher-level cooperatives only wait for lower-level cooperatives to ask for them, while some cadres of lower-level cooperatives think that "profits are small, troubles are many," and "anyway, the state bears the burden of stockpiles, so there is no fear of occupying cooperative funds," so they do not pay attention to publicity and promotion, and only wait for customers to come to their door. As a result, some pesticides are still staying at the prefectural and county-level cooperatives and have not been distributed. For example, the Hanyang Cooperative in Hubei does not actively supply pesticides, causing spider mites to spread and cause disaster in the county, arousing public dissatisfaction; the Shangqiu Prefectural Cooperative in Henan has 400,000 jin of the 550,000 jin of cotton oil soap it ordered lying idle.
    3. Some cooperative cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the patriotic production increase movement and have a purely profit-seeking viewpoint. The Laishui County Cooperative in Hebei Province saw that pesticide prices were not high, so they stored the pesticides and waited to sell them at higher prices. In some places, the prices are set too high because cooperatives lack experience in operating pesticides, so they cannot be sold. For example, the price of lime-sulfur mixture sold by grassroots cooperatives in Shandong Province is 7,100 yuan per bottle, while the cost of self-made by the masses is only 1,400 yuan per jin.
    4. Agricultural departments and cooperatives have failed to closely integrate, and pest control work and pesticide promotion work are disconnected. For example, the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the cooperative only held one joint meeting in the Provincial People's Government, and then there were no more formal talks, and they did not contact each other, resulting in confusion. The Laiyang Prefectural Cooperative in Shandong said that "pesticides are stockpiled," while the agricultural department said that "supply is in short supply," and finally they had to ask the Commissioner's Office to send someone to thoroughly investigate. This mutual estrangement greatly hinders the smooth development of pest control work.
    5. Technical training and publicity and education work have not been done enough. Ordinary farmers lack the technology to store and repair sprayers, so sprayers are easily damaged, and there is no way to repair them when they are broken. At the same time, the use of medicines is also not effective. Some cotton farmers in Hebei and northern Anhui are still stuck in the prevention and control methods of burying soil, using garlic water, and mothballs. The agricultural department of Liaoxi Province only guides farmers to use new medicines such as rotenone and 666, ignoring the use of tobacco and cotton oil soap. The pest control technology has not been deeply implemented at the grassroots level, which not only affects the comprehensive development of the pest control campaign, but also causes serious waste due to technical errors and the formation of random mixing and use.
    At present, pest control has reached the most critical stage. We must immediately reverse the above deviations, vigorously promote pesticides and guide the use of technology, eliminate pests, and ensure a bumper harvest of cotton this year. Therefore, we propose the following measures:
    1. Emergency prevention and control of cotton pests is one of the central tasks of cotton-growing areas. Leading cadres of agricultural departments and cooperatives at all levels must fully recognize its importance, reverse the paralyzing thought of "the next rain will wash them away," and combine the strength of the Party organization and the government to mobilize the masses to vigorously launch a comprehensive emergency pest control campaign. Agricultural departments and cooperatives at all levels should establish close contact and close integration, and if necessary, establish a regular reporting system or a joint office system.
    2. Cooperatives at all levels should correct the purely profit-seeking viewpoint and the passive attitude of sitting and waiting for customers, and quickly launch the promotion of pesticides and machinery to deliver existing pesticides and machinery to farmers. Pesticides that cannot be sold because the price is higher than the market price should be quickly reported to the higher-level cooperative for instructions on how to handle them. In areas where farmers' economic conditions are poor, appropriate methods such as "credit sales and pre-purchases" and "loans" can be used to ensure that cotton farmers have pesticides to control pests.
    3. Agricultural departments at all levels should strengthen technical guidance work, with Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, labor models, and activists as the backbone, to do a good job of technical training at all levels, patiently teach the masses pest control technology by means of collective drug distribution and field demonstrations, regularly provide cooperatives with pest information, and help train cadres, so that pest control work and pesticide/machinery promotion work are closely integrated.
    4. In leading pest control or promoting pesticides and machinery, those who are actively responsible and thus achieve results should be commended or rewarded; those whose work is passive, neglect pest control and pesticide/machinery promotion, and cause cotton pests to not be controlled in a timely manner, the leading organs in various places should give appropriate penalties according to the degree of seriousness.

### 中央人民政府农业部中华全国合作社联合总社联合通知  紧急防治棉虫大力推销治虫药械

    中央人民政府农业部  中华全国合作社联合总社联合通知
    紧急防治棉虫大力推销治虫药械
    目前棉蚜、红蜘蛛在辽东、辽西、河北、平原、山西、山东、陕西、河南、湖北等省普遍发生，为害范围日益扩大，仅辽西一省受害面积即达二十多万垧，河北省据不完全统计也有三百多万亩。其他如蓟马、盲椿象、象鼻虫、卷叶虫、棉铃虫、红铃虫等也在各地相继发生，蔓延迅速，严重地妨碍棉花的生长。
    据各地汇报，大部地区正及时展开治虫运动，积极完成药械推销任务。如辽西省药械已推销百分之九十以上；山东胶州专区将原有药械售尽又向外地调拨供应；河北定县专区共推销喷雾器七千多架。但仍有少数地区，至今仍然没有展开治虫运动，积压大批药械。如河北省售出棉油皂仅占准备数的十分之一，烟叶及硫磺各仅五十分之一，喷雾器仅四分之一，大大地影响棉虫防治工作的进展。这些情况说明我们在防治棉虫、推销药械中，还存在着许多问题。
    一、部分领导干部对于防治棉虫工作有盲目乐观思想。如辽东省有的县区领导干部就以为“棉苗大，蜜不坏”，“下场伏雨就退了”，因之不积极发动群众趁虫害轻的时候抓紧打药防治；而放任自流，缺乏强有力的组织领导工作。
    二、合作社未能积极主动地推销药械。有些上级社的干部只等下面来要，而有些下级社的干部则认为“利润少，麻烦多”，“反正积压由国家负担，不怕占用合作社资金”，因而不注意宣传推销，只等主顾上门。因此，有些农药还停留在专区、县级合作社没有发下去。如湖北汉阳合作社不主动供应农药，使该县红蜘蛛蔓延成灾，引起群众不满；河南商邱专区合作社订制的五十五万斤棉油皂现在还有四十万斤放着没有动。
    三、有些合作社干部对爱国增产运动认识不够，有单纯营利观点。河北涞水县合作社看见农药价格不高，就把农药储存起来，等待高价出卖。有些地方则因为合作社缺乏经营农药的经验，因而价钱定得过高，卖不掉。如山东省各基层社石灰硫磺合剂卖七千一百元一瓶，而群众自己配制的每斤仅需成本一千四百元。
    四、农业部门和合作社未能密切结合，防治工作和农药推销工作脱节。如河南省农林厅和合作社只在省人民政府开了一次联席会议，以后就再也没有正式会谈过，互不联系，因而造成混乱现象。山东莱阳专区合作社说“农药积压”，而农业部门却说“供不应求”，最后只好请专署派人彻查。这种相互间的隔阂，大大地阻碍了治虫工作的顺利展开。
    五、技术传授和宣传教育工作做得不够。一般农民缺乏保管和修理喷雾器的技术，因之喷雾器容易损坏，坏了又无法修理。同时，药剂的使用也不得法，河北、皖北有的棉农还停留在埋土、用大蒜水、卫生球的防治方法。辽西省的农业部门只单纯指导农民用鱼藤精、六六六等新药，忽视使用烟草、棉油皂。治虫技术未能深入下层，不但影响了治虫运动的全面开展，而且由于技术上发生错误，形成了乱配乱用的严重浪费现象。
    目前防治棉虫已到最紧张的阶段，必须立即扭转上述偏向，大力推销农药与指导使用技术，消灭虫害，才能保证今年棉花的丰收。因此我们提出下列几点措施：
    一、紧急防治棉虫是目前棉区工作的中心任务之一，各级农业部门和合作社领导干部必须充分认识它的重要性，扭转“下场雨就退了”的麻痹思想，结合党的组织和政府的力量，发动群众大力展开全面的紧急防治棉虫运动。各级农业部门和合作社应取得密切联系，紧密结合，必要时可建立定期汇报制度或联合办公制度。
    二、各级合作社应纠正单纯营利观点和坐待顾客的消极态度，迅速展开药械推销工作，把现有药械送到农民手中。凡售价高于市价无法脱手的农药，应迅速呈报上级社请示处理办法。在农民经济条件较差的地区，可适当运用“赊销预购”“贷放”等办法，保证棉农有药治虫。
    三、各级农业部门应加强技术指导工作，以共产党员、青年团员、劳动模范、积极分子为骨干，逐级做好技术传授工作，用集体配药、田间示范等方式耐心教会群众治虫技术，经常供给合作社虫害情报，并帮助训练干部，使治虫工作和药械推销工作紧密地结合起来。
    四、在领导治虫或推销药械中，对积极负责因而获得成绩者，应予以表扬或奖励；对工作消极、忽视治虫和推销药械而使棉田虫害不能及时治除者，各地领导机关应根据不同程度分别予以处分。
