    Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council recently issued a letter to the peace committees of various countries participating in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The letter stated: The preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference was successfully held in Beijing from June 3rd to 6th, and it issued declarations and resolutions on promoting the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific region and convening the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The people of Asian and Pacific countries who love peace, as well as the people of the whole world, have unanimously expressed their warm support for the achievements of this preparatory meeting.
    The representatives of various countries who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference have now returned to their respective countries one after another. After the representatives communicated and reported on the situation of the preparatory meeting, we believe that the preparatory work in various countries will definitely have greater development.
    The Asian and Pacific regional peace work is an important part of the entire world peace work. Successfully convening the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will also greatly help the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress in December this year. We—the World Peace Council—earnestly expect you to exert the greatest promotion and organization role for the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. We are willing to cooperate with you and work together to successfully convene the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.
