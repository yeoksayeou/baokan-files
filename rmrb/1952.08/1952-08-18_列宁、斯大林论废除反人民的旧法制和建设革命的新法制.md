Editor's note: In order to theoretically enhance everyone's understanding of the current judicial reform movement, and to absorb the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in this regard, so as to promote the judicial reform work in our country, we have specially selected a part of Lenin's and Stalin's works related to abolishing the anti-people old legal system and building a revolutionary new legal system for the reference of judicial organs at all levels, other political and legal departments, and political and legal departments of various universities in the ideological struggle against the old legal views. Except for one or two places directly translated from the Russian version, all the quotations from the original works of Lenin and Stalin are excerpts from the Chinese translations published in our country and published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House.

    The People's Revolutionary Regime Does Not Recognize Any Other Regime or Law
    The special methods of historical creation adopted during the revolutionary storm are not applicable to other periods of political life. The most important of these methods are as follows: (1) The people "seize" political freedom—realizing this freedom without any legal rights or laws, and without any restrictions... (2) Creating new revolutionary political organs—Soviets of Workers, Soldiers, Railway Workers, and Peasants Representatives, new rural and urban governments, and so on. … The above-mentioned political organs are the sprouts of dictatorship, because this power does not recognize any other power or any law, and does not recognize any norms set by anyone. … It relies on the people. This is the fundamental difference between this new regime and all past old political organs. (Lenin: On the History of the Question of Dictatorship. Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 12, pp. 287-288)
    The socialist proletariat must not forget for a minute that it is facing and will inevitably face a revolutionary mass struggle that will crush all the legal system of bourgeois society condemned to death. (Complete Works of Lenin, Russian Edition, Vol. 16, p. 284)
    The victorious revolution and its will spokesman—the Provisional Revolutionary Government—is the master before the establishment of a permanent government, so it can certainly abolish laws and formulate laws! If not, if the Provisional Government does not enjoy these rights, then its existence becomes meaningless, and the people who rise up will not create such an institution. (Quoted from Arzhanov's: Stalin's Complete Works, Vol. 1, On State and Law. Sino-Soviet Friendship, Vol. 2, Issue 8)

    Instead of Reforming the Old Courts, Completely Abolish Them
    The policy adopted by the Soviet regime in the socialist army has also been applied to another more sophisticated and complex tool of the ruling class—the bourgeois court. The bourgeois court pretends to maintain order, but in fact, it is a blind and sophisticated tool for ruthlessly suppressing the exploited to protect the interests of wallets. The Soviet regime has acted in accordance with the legacy of previous proletarian revolutions—abolishing the old courts all at once. Let people shout that we do not reform the old courts, but abolish them all at once. We have thus cleared the way to create truly people's courts; the method is to use less coercive force, but more mass examples, the prestige of laborers, and no formal procedures—this is what will turn the courts from tools of exploitation into tools for education on the solid foundation of socialist society. (Lenin: "Report on the Work of the People's Committee" in 1918. Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 13, p. 19)

    The People Create Their Own New Laws in the Course of Revolution
    As early as 1906, Lenin pointed out when discussing the attitude of the revolutionary masses towards the law: "In the course of the revolution, the people themselves directly create new laws." Comrade Stalin developed Lenin's proposition and also emphasized that the working masses "need political power as a lever for transformation. The new regime creates a new legal system and a new order, and this order is a revolutionary order." (Quoted from Sudarikov and Bekov's joint work, Lectures on Soviet State and Law Issues, p. 130)
    "...It is precisely the dictatorship of the people. Because the people... come to power directly, handle court and punishment procedures themselves, use political power themselves, and create new revolutionary codes. (Lenin: On the History of the Question of Dictatorship. Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 12, p. 316)

    The Importance of Revolutionary Legal System in the Construction Period
    The dictatorship of the proletariat has its various periods, various special forms, and various different working methods. During the period of the civil war, the forceful aspect of the dictatorship was particularly obvious. However, it cannot be concluded from this that no construction work was carried out during the civil war. Without construction work, the civil war cannot be carried out. On the contrary, during the period of socialist construction, the peaceful work, organizational work, and cultural work of the dictatorship, revolutionary legal system, etc. are particularly obvious. However, it cannot be concluded from this that the forceful aspect of the dictatorship has disappeared or may disappear during the construction period. At present, during the construction period, suppression organs, the army, and other organizations are as necessary as during the civil war. Without these organs, the dictatorship cannot carry out construction work with some guarantees. (Stalin: "Problems of Leninism", p. 176)

    The Role of the People's Courts and Methods to Strengthen It
    When the basic task of the regime has gradually shifted from military suppression to management work, the typical manifestations of suppression and coercion will gradually be replaced by court trials instead of on-the-spot executions. In this regard, the revolutionary masses took the correct path after October 25, 1917, and proved the vitality of the revolution. Before the promulgation of any decree dissolving the bourgeois bureaucratic judicial organs, they had already begun to organize their own, that is, the courts of workers and peasants. However, our people's revolutionary courts are still extremely weak. It can also be felt that the people regard the courts as a kind of alien bureaucratic thing. This view inherited from the oppression of landlords and the bourgeoisie has not been completely broken. The people have not fully realized that the courts are the organs that attract all the poor to participate in national management (because judicial affairs are one of the functions of national management), the courts are the organs of the proletariat and the poor peasants' regime, and the courts are tools for training the people to abide by discipline. (Lenin: On "The Current Tasks of the Soviet Regime". Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 2, p. 396)
    The new courts are needed, first of all, to fight against the exploiters who attempt to restore their rule or insist on their privileges, or secretly plunder and defraud these privileges. But in addition to this, if the courts are truly organized on the principles of the Soviet organs, then they also bear another more important task, which is to ensure the strict implementation of the discipline and conscious discipline of the working people. (Quoted from Sudarikov and Bekov's joint work, Lectures on Soviet State and Law Issues, p. 215)
    Our purpose is to absorb all the poor to participate in management work, and all the steps to achieve this goal—the more forms, the better—should be carefully recorded, studied, systematized, reviewed with more extensive experience, and defined as regulations. (Lenin: On "The Current Tasks of the Soviet Regime". Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 2, p. 402)
    We have a "magical method" that can strengthen our state organs ten times immediately, which no capitalist country has ever imagined or can imagine. This magical thing is to absorb workers and absorb the poor to regularly participate in the work of state management. (Complete Works of Lenin, Russian Edition, Vol. 26, p. 87)

    National Legal System Must Be Unified, But Local Characteristics Should Be Taken Care of During Implementation
    Regarding the legal system, there cannot be legal systems in Kaluga Province or Kazan Province, but only a unified legal system for all of Russia, or even a unified legal system for all Soviet Federal Republics... In those places where it is necessary to be good at estimating that there are truly unavoidable differences, the "dual" subordination system is necessary. The agriculture in Kaluga Province is obviously different from the agriculture in Kazan Province. The same is true in all industries. The same is true for the entire administrative aspect or management organ. In all such issues, if the local characteristics are not taken into account, we will fall into bureaucratic centralization, etc., which will prevent local staff from estimating local differences, which is the basis of reasonable work. But the legal system should be unified... If we do not absolutely implement this most basic condition for stipulating a unified legal system for the entire federation, then there is no way to talk about any protection and any construction of civilization. (Lenin: "On 'Dual' Subordination System and Legal System'". Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 2, pp. 977-978)

    Principles of Selecting Cadres and Improving State Organs
    We must in any case set the task of reforming our state organs in this way: first, to learn; second, to learn; third, to learn again, and then to check, so that our discipline here does not become dead words or fashionable empty talk (honestly speaking, this is a particularly common phenomenon in our country), so that discipline truly penetrates into the body, completely and truly becomes a component of life. In short, what we should propose is not the requirements proposed by the Western European bourgeoisie, but the requirements that a country whose purpose is to develop into a socialist country should appropriately propose. From this, we can draw the conclusion that we should create the People's Commissariat of Workers and Peasants Inspection, which is a tool for improving our organs, into a true model organ... To achieve this, we should make the existing excellent elements in our social system: first, advanced workers; second, truly enlightened elements who can guarantee speaking without the slightest falsehood or conscience, - not afraid to admit any difficulties, not afraid to carry out any struggle to achieve serious goals... This rule should be followed: better a small number, but with good quality... If we are determined to truly create it into such an organ in the next few years: first, it should be a model; second, it can arouse everyone's absolute belief; third, it proves to everyone that it truly deserves to be the work of a high-level organ like the Central Supervisory Committee, then we should keep this in mind... The staff of the People's Commissariat of Workers and Peasants Inspection, we should completely and especially select them. (Lenin: "Better Fewer, But Better". Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 2, pp. 1022-1023)

    列宁、斯大林论废除反人民的旧法制和建设革命的新法制
    编者按：为了从理论上提高大家对于当前司法改革运动的认识，并吸取苏联在这一方面的先进经验：以推进我国的司法改革工作，我们特地从列宁、斯大林的著作中选录一部分有关废除反人民的旧法制与建设革命的新法制的论述，供各级司法机关、其他政法部门及各大学政法学系在反对旧法观点的思想斗争中学习的参考。其中凡引自列宁、斯大林原著的，除有一、二处是直接由俄文本译出的以外，都是节录我国出版的及莫斯科外国文书籍出版局出版的中译本的译文。
    人民革命政权不承认任何其他的政权和法律
    在革命旋风时期所采用的历史创造底几个特殊的方法，是为政治生活底其他时期所不能采用的。这些方法中最重要的方法如下：（一）民众之“夺取”政治自由——实现这个自由，不根据任何的法权和法律，也不受任何的限制……（二）造成新的革命政权机关——工、兵、铁路工人、农民代表苏维埃，新的乡村与城市的政权，以及其他等等。……上述的政权机关，就是专政底萌芽，因为这个政权不承认任何其他的政权和任何的法律，不承认任何人所定的任何规范。……它依靠民众。这就是这个新政权和过去一切旧政权机关之基本的区别。（列宁：论专政问题底历史。列宁选集第十二卷第二八七——二八八页）
    社会主义无产阶级一分钟也不能忘记，它正面临着而且不可避免地面临着一个革命的群众性的斗争，这一斗争将粉碎被判定死亡的资产阶级社会的全部法制。（列宁全集俄文版第十六卷第二八四页）
    胜利的革命及其意志的代言人——临时革命政府——就是永久性政府成立以前的主宰，所以它当然能够废止法律和制订法律！如其不然，临时政府不能享有这些权利，那么，它的存在就变成无意义的了，而起义的人民也就不会创立这样的一个机构了。（引自阿尔然诺夫著：斯大林全集第一卷论国家与法律。中苏友好二卷八期）
    不是改良旧法院而是彻底废除旧法院
    苏维埃政权在社会主义军队方面所采取过的方针，同时也应用到统治阶级底别一种更精巧更复杂的工具——资产阶级的法庭——方面来了。资产阶级的法庭假装维持秩序，而实际上，却是无情镇压被剥削者以保护钱包利益的盲目而精巧的工具。苏维埃政权曾依照历次无产阶级革命底遗训行事，——一下子将旧法庭废除了。让人们叫喊吧，说我们不改良旧法庭，而一下子将它废除了。我们这样就扫清了道路来创造真正的人民法庭；其方法是少用高压的力量，而多用群众的实例，劳动者底威信，不用形式手续，——就是这一点会将法庭由剥削底工具变成在社会主义社会底巩固基础上施行教育的工具。（列宁：一九一八年“人民委员会底工作报告”。列宁选集第十三卷第十九页）
    人民在革命进程中创造自己的新法律
    列宁远在一九○六年研讨革命群众对待法律的态度问题时曾经指出：“在革命进程中人民大众自己就直接地创造新的法律。”斯大林同志发挥着列宁的这一命题，也着重指出：劳动大众“需要政权作为改造的杠杆。新的政权创造新的法制、新的秩序，而这种秩序就是革命的秩序。”（引自苏达里可夫与贝可夫合著苏维埃国家与法律问题讲座第一三○页）
    “……恰恰是民众的专政。因为民众……自己直接上台，自己处理法庭和惩罚手续，自己使用政权，创造新的革命法典。（列宁：论专政问题底历史。列宁选集第十二卷第三一六页）
    革命法制在建设时期的重要性
    无产阶级专政有其各个时期，各种特别形式，各种不同的工作方法。在国内战争时期特别表现明显的，是专政底强力方面。可是，从这里决不能得出结论，说在国内战争时期没有进行任何建设工作。不进行建设工作，便无法进行国内战争。反之，在社会主义建设时期特别表现得明显的，却是专政底和平工作，组织工作和文化工作，革命法制等等。可是，从这里同样也决不能得出结论，说在建设时期，专政底强力方面已经消失或可能消失。现时，在建设时期中，镇压机关、军队以及其他组织，也是如在国内战争时期一样必要的。如果没有这些机关，那末，专政就没有可能进行有若干保证的建设工作。（斯大林：“列宁主义问题”第一七六页）
    人民法院的作用和加强它的作用的方法
    当政权底基本任务已逐渐由军事镇压转变为管理工作时，镇压和强迫手段底标本表现，也会逐渐由法庭审判来代替就地枪决。在这一方面，革命群众在一九一七年十月二十五日以后，就走上了正确的道路，并证明出革命底生命力，他们在尚未颁布解散资产阶级官僚司法机关的任何法令以前，就已开始组织自己的，即工农的法庭。可是我们的人民革命法庭还极端软弱。还可以感觉到，民众把法庭看作是一种异己的官场东西，这种由地主资产阶级压迫所遗传下来的观点，还没有彻底打破。民众还没有充分意识到，法庭正是吸引全体贫民参加国家管理的机关（因为司法事务是国家管理机能之一），法庭是无产阶级和贫苦农民底政权机关，法庭是训练人民遵守纪律的工具。（列宁：论“苏维埃政权底当前任务”。列宁文选第二卷三九六页）
    新法院之所以需要，首先是为了同企图恢复自己统治地位或坚持自己特权，或秘密攘夺骗取这些特权的某一部分的剥削者们作斗争。但是除此以外，如果法院真正是在苏维埃机关的原则上组织起来的话，那么它还担负着另一个更重要的任务，这就是保证严格地实行劳动人民的纪律和自觉纪律的任务。（引自苏达里可夫、贝可夫合著苏维埃国家与法律问题讲座第二一五页）
    我们的目的，是要吸收全体贫民来参加管理工作，而实现这个目的的一切步骤——其形式愈多愈好——应该详细地登记起来，加以研究，使之系统化，以更广泛的经验来从事审查，并定为法规。（列宁：论“苏维埃政权底当前任务”。列宁文选第二卷第四○二页）
    我们有一种“神奇的方法”能够一举而立刻十倍加强我们的国家机关，这种方法是任何一个资本主义国家从来没有设想过而且也不能设想的。这一神奇的事情就是吸收劳动者，吸收贫民经常参加国家管理的工作。（列宁全集俄文版第二十六卷第八十七页）
    全国法制必须统一，但执行时应照顾地方的特点
    关于法律制度一层，不能有加路格省或嘉桑省的法制，而只应是全俄罗斯统一的，甚至是全苏维埃联邦共和国统一的法制，……在那些要善于估计到是有真正不免的区别存在的地方，“两重”从属制是必要的。加路格省的农业与嘉桑省的农业显然不同。在全部工业中也有同样的情形。对于整个行政方面或管理机关也是如此。在这样的一切问题中，若不估计到地方特点，就会陷入官僚主义的集中制等等，就会妨碍地方工作人员去估计地方区别，这种估计乃是合理工作的基础。但法制应当是统一的，……如果我们不来绝对施行这种规定全联邦统一法制的最起码条件，那就根本谈不上对文明性有任何保护和任何建树了。（列宁：“论‘两重’从属制与法律制度”。列宁文选第二卷第九七七——九七八页）
    选拔干部、改善国家机关的原则
    我们无论如何都要定下这样革新我们国家机关的任务：第一，是学习；第二，是学习；第三，还是学习，然后就来检查，要使我们这里的学科不致成为死板文字或时髦空谈（老实说，这在我国是特别常见的现象），要使学科切实渗透到机体内部，完全并真正变为生活底组成部分。总之，我们所应当提出的，不是西欧资产阶级所提出的要求，而是其目的在于发展成为社会主义国家的国家所应份适当提出的要求。由此可以得出这样的结论：我们应当把这作为改善我国机关之工具的工农检查人民委员部，造成为真正的模范机关。……要做到这点，就应使我国社会制度中现有的优秀成份：第一，是先进工人，第二，是真正开明的，能于保证丝毫不信空言、丝毫不昧良心说话的分子，——都绝不害怕承认任何困难，不怕为达到严重目的而进行任何斗争。……应该遵守这一规则：宁肯数量少，但要质量好。……如果我们抱定目的，真要在最近几年内，把它造成为这样的机关：第一，应当是模范的，第二，能引起大家的绝对信仰，第三，向所有每个人证明，真不愧为像中央监察委员会这样一个高级机关的工作，那我们就应该牢记着这点。……工农检查人民委员部底职员，我们应当来完全特别加以选拔。（列宁：“宁肯少些，但要好些”。列宁文选第二卷第一○二二——一○二三页）
