The Conference Held by the Electricity Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry to Promote Advanced Work Experience

The conference held by the Electricity Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry from July 25th to 30th to promote advanced work experience was a good start to the planned and guided promotion of advanced experience in the national electricity system. The conference was attended by 464 administrative management cadres, engineering and technical personnel, model workers, and advanced workers from the Central Fuel Industry Ministry, the North China Administrative Committee, the Statistics Department of the Central Finance and Economics Committee, the National Committee of the China Electricity Workers' Union, and various electricity units in major administrative regions, electricity workers' unions, and directly affiliated bureaus and factories of the Electricity Management Bureau in North China.

The meeting used forms such as conference performances, group performances, chart exhibitions, and typical reports to focus on introducing advanced experiences of great value to improving electricity production, such as burning low-value coal, rapid overhaul, scientific round inspection method, load adjustment, and assembly line operation methods in civil engineering and construction; it also introduced other inventions. After group discussions, the meeting studied the ideological or technical difficulties and problems that might be encountered in promoting advanced experience.

This conference boosted the confidence and determination of electricity workers across the country to promote advanced experience. Administrative cadres, engineering and technical personnel, model workers, and advanced workers who participated in the conference warmly welcomed the advanced experience introduced at the conference and expressed their determination to promote it well after returning. At the award ceremony on July 30th, many units were rewarded and commended by the conference for their achievements in promoting advanced experience. Such as the Shijingshan Power Plant's burning of low-value coal, the Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau's load adjustment, the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's rapid overhaul, the Shijingshan Power Plant and the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant's scientific round inspection method, the Electricity Management Bureau's Central Laboratory and the Shijingshan Power Plant's boiler water treatment and simple methods for calculating boiler thermal efficiency during operation, the Electricity Management Bureau's Construction Engineering Bureau's combined line assembly line operation method, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau's rational electricity consumption, etc. The conference specially presented two large silver shields to the Soviet experts who had served in China and those who are serving in China, and sent a telegram of thanks to the Soviet experts who had returned home to express the sincerity of Chinese electricity workers to them.

    中央燃料工业部电业管理总局
    举行盛大的推广先进工作经验大会
    中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局在七月二十五日到三十日举行的推广先进工作经验大会，是全国电业系统有计划有领导地推广先进经验的一个良好开端。出席这次大会的有中央燃料工业部、华北行政委员会、中央财政经济委员会统计处、中国电业工会全国委员会和来自各大行政区电业单位、电业工会、电业管理总局直属华北各局厂等单位的行政管理干部、工程技术人员、劳动模范和先进工作者共四百六十四人。
    会议通过大会表演、小组表演、图表展览、典型报告等形式，着重地介绍了对于改进电业生产有重大价值的先进经验，如燃烧低值煤、快速检修、科学巡回检查法、调整负荷以及土木建筑方面的流水作业法；同时也介绍了其他方面的创造发明。会议经过小组讨论，研究了推广先进经验时可能遇到的思想上或技术上的困难和问题。
    这次大会鼓舞了全国电业职工推广先进经验的信心和决心。参加这次大会的行政干部、工程技术人员、劳动模范和先进工作者，都热烈欢迎大会介绍的先进经验，表示回去之后，一定要好好推广。在七月三十日的给奖大会上，许多单位因推广先进经验有成绩受到大会奖励和表扬。如石景山发电厂的燃烧低值煤、太原电业局的调整负荷、唐山电业局和天津电业局的快速检修、石景山发电厂和天津第一发电厂的科学巡回检查法、电业管理总局中心试验所和石景山发电厂的炉水处理和运行中求锅炉热效率的简易办法、电业管理总局修建工程局的组合式线路流水作业法、北京电业局的合理用电等等。大会特向曾在中国服务过的苏联专家们和正在中国服务的苏联专家们各赠送大银盾一只，并向已回国的苏联专家们致谢电，以表示中国电业职工对他们的诚意。（新华社）
