I am how to treat the advanced leadership experience of the "Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meeting"
Feng Shiduan, Secretary of the Third District Party Committee of Changzhi, Shanxi

	In March of this year, Wang Dingxiang, a labor model from Nanhe Village in the Third District of Changzhi, Shanxi, returned from attending the labor model network conference in Nangou and created the leadership method of "Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meeting." The Nanhe Village branch seized this advanced leadership experience and pushed the village's mutual aid movement to a climax. But at that time, I regarded this advanced leadership experience as a general working method. Although I called on everyone to learn from Wang Dingxiang at the district cadre meeting, I talked about it very superficially. This was a mistake.

	On May 11th, the Shanxi Daily published news that Wang Dingxiang, a labor model from Nanhe Village, used the "Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meeting" method to develop and consolidate mutual aid teams, and asked mutual aid teams in various places to learn from this experience. At this time, I still didn't pay attention to vigorously promoting this experience. Because I knew that Wang Dingxiang had introduced this experience at every village cadre meeting and mutual aid team representative meeting; Comrade Zhao Baicheng, the deputy secretary of the District Committee, also paid attention to promoting this experience. Now that the newspaper has introduced it again, I thought that the district and village cadres must already know it, so there was no need to summarize and promote it as a special experience. This was another mistake.

	On May 31st, the Shanxi Daily published a short commentary suggesting that various places promote two good methods for village-level leadership in cooperative mutual aid movements. One of the good methods for leading the cooperative mutual aid movement was the "Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meeting" with labor model Wang Dingxiang as the core in Nanhe Village. The short commentary finally pointed out: The local leading cadres did not discover the above experience, or did not actively summarize and promote it after discovering it. When I saw this, I felt like I had been hit on the head, and I quickly woke up and realized that I had committed a bureaucratic error. So I exchanged views with the main cadres in the district and decided to promote Wang Dingxiang's experience well. At that time, the district's mutual aid team representative meeting was being held, so this experience was discussed by everyone. After discussion, everyone thought "this method is very good." Finally, a formal resolution was made, and each representative returned to the village to promote it universally. According to recent inspections, 15 villages have established this system, with great results.

	In the previous period, there was a drought, and more than 2,000 mu of dry hemp in the district had not been planted. Many people were waiting for rain, and some began to doubt and waver about the hemp planting plan. A labor model in Xincheng Village led his team to research a method of carrying water to plant hemp. After this method was implemented in his team, it was very effective, so they specifically introduced this experience at the mutual aid team leader liaison meeting. This increased everyone's confidence in fighting the drought. Immediately, 150 people from 20 teams went out to carry water to plant hemp, forming a mass movement.

	Facts have proved that actively promoting the "Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meeting" is indeed a very good leadership method. Using this method saves time and solves problems. In the future, I must popularize this method throughout the district, and continue to discover problems, solve problems, and summarize a more complete set of experiences in leading the mutual aid movement during the promotion process.

	At present, some district cadres still do not take this experience seriously during the promotion process. The resistance of village cadres is also great, and some even are jealous of other people's advanced experience. Therefore, correcting the individualistic heroism of some district and village cadres is a very important task, which is the key to whether this advanced experience can be universally promoted.

### 我是怎样对待“互助组长接头会”的先进领导经验的

    我是怎样对待“互助组长接头会”的先进领导经验的
    中共山西长治三区区委书记    冯士端
    今年三月，山西长治三区南和村劳动模范王定祥，从南沟参加劳动模范网会议回来，创造了“互助组长接头会”的领导方法。南和村支部就抓住了这个先进的领导经验，把村里的互助运动推向了高潮。但我当时把这个先进的领导经验，当作了一个一般的工作方法。虽然在区干部会议上，也曾号召大家向王定祥学习，但是谈得非常皮毛。这是一个错误。
    五月十一日的山西日报登载了南和村劳动模范王定祥用“互助组长接头会”的办法发展和巩固了互助组的消息，并让各地互助组学习这个经验。这时，我还没有注意大力推广这个经验。因为我知道每次村干部会、互助组代表会，都由王定祥介绍了这一经验；区委副书记赵白成同志也很注意推广这一经验，如今报纸又把它介绍出来，我想，区村干部一定都已经知道，用不着当作一个专门经验，再去总结推广了。这是又一次的错误。
    五月三十一日的山西日报上，有一篇短评，建议各地推广村级领导合作互助运动的两个好办法。其中有一个领导合作互助运动的好办法就是南和村以劳动模范王定祥为核心的“互助组长接头会”。短评最后指出：上述经验，当地领导干部却未发现，或者发现后不去积极地总结推广。当我看到这里的时候，真像被迎头打了一棒，我很快清醒起来，认识到自己犯了官僚主义的错误。于是和区里的主要干部交换了意见，决定把王定祥的经验很好地推广出去。当时正在召开全区互助组代表会议，就把这一经验让大家进行了讨论。经过讨论，大家都认为
    “这个办法很好”。最后，正式作出了决议，由各代表回村去普遍推广。据最近的检查，已有十五个村建立了这个制度，收效很大。
    前一个时期天旱，全区尚有二千余亩旱麻没下种，好多人等待下雨，有的因此对种麻的计划开始怀疑、动摇。辛呈村的一个劳动模范领导本组研究出了担水种麻的方法。这方法在本组实行后，很有成效，他们就在互助组长接头会上专门介绍了这个经验。这就提高了大家向旱灾作斗争的信心，立即有二十个组的一百五十个人出动，担水种麻，形成了一个群众性的运动。
    事实证明了积极推广“互助组长接头会”确是很好的领导方法。运用这种方法，既省时间，又能够解决问题。今后我一定要把这个办法普及全区，并在推广中继续发现问题，解决问题，总结出一套更完整的领导互助运动的经验。
    目前，在推广这一经验中，还有部分区干部不把这个经验看在眼里。村干部中的抵抗情绪也大，甚至还有人嫉视别人的先进经验。因此，纠正某些区村干部的个人英雄主义思想，是一件很重要的工作，这是能否普遍推广这一先进经验的关键。
