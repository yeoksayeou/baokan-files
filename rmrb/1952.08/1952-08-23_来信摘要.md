Letter Summary

    **Unreasonable Regulations on Salt Workers' Burden of Loss Should Be Abolished in the Huaibei Salt Area**

    In the Huaibei Salt Area, a system that exploited salt workers during the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule still exists, that is, workers who hand in 120 jin of salt are only credited with 100 jin, with the remaining 20 jin considered as loss. This system is extremely unreasonable. According to the salt workers' calculations, even on rainy days, the loss is less than 10 jin per 100 jin when carrying salt from the salt pile to the ship, and even less on sunny days. The salt workers have raised objections to this unreasonable system, but the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau has not resolved it. The salt workers said with dissatisfaction: "The administration wants to reduce costs, so they are focusing on us workers, which is too unreasonable!"

    I believe that the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau should accept the workers' opinions and quickly abolish this unreasonable system.

    **Excessive Working Hours for Employees in Changzhou Cooked Noodle Shops**

    In some shops in Changzhou, southern Jiangsu, employees work excessively long hours. The most serious is the cooked noodle industry. Workers in this industry sometimes work 21 hours a day, and at least 18 hours; some noodle shops open at 6:30 in the morning and do not close until 2:30 in the morning. This situation has seriously affected the health of the employees. Many shop employees are demanding reasonable working hours. I hope you will assist in resolving this issue.

    **Editor's Note:** In order to protect the health of employees and improve labor efficiency, industrialists and businessmen in various regions should resolutely implement the eight- to ten-hour working day system in a planned and step-by-step manner. If certain industries, due to special working conditions, cannot currently implement the eight- to ten-hour working day system, labor and management should consult and resolve the issue reasonably. It is clearly unreasonable for cooked noodle shop employees in Changzhou to work more than 18 hours a day. The Changzhou Trade Union should support the correct demands of the workers for "reasonable working hours." The local People's Government Labor Bureau should also be responsible for resolving this issue.

    **Wheat Affected by Gibberella Zeae Contains Toxins; Wash Diseased Wheat Thoroughly When Eating**

    This year, wheat in some areas of Wuxi City has been affected by Gibberella zeae. Some people feel unwell after eating food made from this diseased wheat. I think this may be because the diseased wheat is toxic. I hope you will study this issue. Guan Dihua

    **Editor's Note:** According to the reply from the Pest and Disease Control Division of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, Gibberella zeae contains toxins. People who eat this diseased wheat will experience dizziness, vomiting, and blurred vision. It is also bad for livestock and poultry to eat it. However, if the diseased wheat is washed repeatedly, most of the bacteria can be removed, reducing the toxicity.

    来信摘要
    淮北盐区应取消盐工负担耗损的不合理规定
    淮北盐区至今还保留着国民党反动派剥削盐工的一种制度，即工人交一百二十斤盐只算一百斤，其余二十斤作为耗损。这个制度是十分不合理的。据盐工们计算，从盐堆子把盐挑到船上，即使下雨天，每百斤耗损也不到十斤，晴天就更少了。盐工们对这种不合理的制度曾提过意见，但淮北盐务管理局一直没有解决。盐工们不满地说：“行政上要降低成本，就在我们工人身上打主意，太不合理了！”
    我认为，淮北盐务管理局应该接受工人意见，迅速取消这种不合理的制度。

    常州市熟面业店员工时过长
    苏南常州市有些店员工人工时过长。其中最严重的是熟面业。该业工人有时每天做工二十一小时，最少也得十八小时；有的面店从早上六时半开门，一直到午夜二时半才休息。这种情况已经严重地影响了职工的健康。很多店员工人都要求合理规定工时。希望你们协助解决这个问题。

    编者按：为了保障职工健康，提高劳动效率，各地工商业者应该有计划有步骤地坚决贯彻八小时至十小时工作制。某些行业，如因工作情况特殊，目前还不能实行八小时至十小时工作制的，应由劳资协商斟酌合理解决。常州市熟面业职工每日工作十八小时以上，显然是不合理的。常州市工会应该支持工人群众关于“合理规定工时”的正确要求。当地人民政府劳动局亦应该负责解决这个问题。
    害赤霉病的小麦含有毒素  食用时应将病麦多加冲洗
    今年无锡市有些地方的小麦害了赤霉病。有人吃了这种病麦做的食品就不舒服。我想这可能是病麦有毒。希望你们研究一下这个问题。关迪华
    编者按：根据中央人民政府农业部病虫害防
    治司答复，赤霉菌有毒素。人吃了这种病麦将
    引起晕眩、呕吐及视力障碍等症，家畜、家禽
    吃了也不好。但如将病麦多次冲洗，就能除去
    大部病菌，减轻毒害。
