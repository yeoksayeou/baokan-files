Southwest China's literary and art circles began preparations for a rectification study on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." On that day, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily published an editorial calling on literary and art circles to use Chairman Mao's documents as weapons to thoroughly examine literary and artistic thought on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign. The Chongqing Federation of Literary and Art Circles also held a commemorative meeting on the same day and made a mobilization for the literary and artistic rectification movement at the meeting. The rectification movement in Chongqing's literary and art circles officially began on June 22. As early as last year, after the launch of the rectification study movement in Beijing's literary and art circles, some units in Southwest China, such as the Creation and Research Office of the Combat Cultural Troupe of the Southwest Military Region, the Cultural Troupe of a certain infantry school of the Southwest Military Region, as well as literary and art workers of the entire Yunnan Military Region, and the Southwest People's Art Institute, had already conducted preliminary examinations of literary and artistic thought. At the Southwest and Chongqing Literary and Art Workers Congress convened by the Chongqing Federation of Literary and Art Circles on May 23, Ren Baige, chairman of the Chongqing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Sha Ting, vice chairman, both made reports. Ren Baige recounted the great historical significance of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and after pointing out the achievements made by literary and art circles in implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, pointed out the existing errors and shortcomings in Southwest China's literary and art circles and the reasons for their emergence, calling on everyone to earnestly and consciously carry out ideological remolding and strive to implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction. In his report, Sha Ting reviewed some specific work of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and hoped that all literary and art workers in Chongqing would clarify the position, thought, and viewpoints of the working class in the rectification movement and achieve victory in ideological remolding.

The Xinhua Daily and "Southwest Literature and Art" have successively published some review articles by leading cadres and literary and art workers in the field of literature and art. In his article "A Preliminary Review of the Work of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles," Sha Ting reviewed his neglect of the ideological leadership of the working class in his leadership work in the Southwest and Chongqing Federation of Literary and Art Circles. In his leadership of "Southwest Literature and Art" and the organs of the preparatory committee of the Southwest Federation of Literary and Art Circles, he neglected the ideological education of cadres. "Southwest Literature and Art" published works with petty-bourgeois ideological sentiments, and the journal's connection with the masses was also insufficient. In the leadership work of the Chongqing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, he neglected the literary and artistic creation activities of the masses. For example, last year, the Chongqing Dramatists Association held a one-act play solicitation, and received 348 submissions in less than three months, among which the better ones such as "Old Head of the House" and "Glorious Flower" were all creations by workers. Sha Ting said: "Whoever underestimates their development prospects and their great significance in the development of the entire literary and art cause will make mistakes." But he himself rarely took the initiative to arrange and inspect this department's work. At the same time, he adopted an irresponsible bureaucratic attitude towards "Telling Old Stories and Singing New Tunes," and rarely checked the ideological content of the publications, so that works expressing petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ideas appeared in the publications from time to time. For example, the most recent issue published "Labor Production as a Model," which openly promoted individual fame and status ideas.

Li Changlu, Deputy Director of the Department of Culture and Education of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, pointed out the thin atmosphere of literary and art criticism in Southwest China in his article "Preliminary Examination of Several Issues in Film, Opera, and Literary and Art Teaching." For example, when the film "The Life of Wu Xun" was screened in Southwest China, some people initially praised it, even applauding it, but the discussion of this reactionary film was not well developed. There was a tendency of anti-patriotism and anti-historicism in the creation and performance of operas. In terms of literary and artistic teaching, such as the Southwest People's Art Institute, the Chinese Department of the Southwest Normal College, and the Chinese Department of Chongqing University, there was a serious confusion of thought. In the literary and artistic teaching of the Southwest People's Art Institute, most of it was about moving bourgeois foreign dogmas. Some people believed that only Western music and fine arts were scientific, and Chinese ancient art and folk art were unscientific. In the Chinese Department of the Southwest Normal College, some people were also stubbornly clinging to waste paper and remnant piles. In the Chinese Department of Chongqing University, there was a rather serious existence of purely technical viewpoints and dogmatic teaching viewpoints.

Chen Bo, head of the "Combat Cultural Troupe" of the Southwest Military Region, reviewed in his "My Review" that because he had not thoroughly carried out ideological remolding in a long-term combat environment, he had not been able to resist the influence and attacks of bourgeois thought after entering the city, which led to losses for the literary and artistic work of the troops. For example, due to inappropriate attention to the "professionalization" of the "Combat Cultural Troupe," blindly expanding the organization, purchasing unnecessary materials, mistakenly wanting to build the cultural troupe into a college, and building the data room into a small museum. However, there were very few creations and performances about the heroic figures and heroic deeds of the Southwest troops.

Xu Jiarui, director of the preparatory committee of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, reviewed in his "Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Publication of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'" his neglect of the importance of literary and art workers going to actual struggles to carry out ideological remolding in the leadership work of the Yunnan Federation of Literary and Art Circles' preparatory committee organs. When a large number of cadres from the Federation of Literary and Art Circles went to the countryside to participate in the rent reduction and deposit refund struggle, he shouted: "The people of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles are all transferred away, and the work cannot be promoted." He failed to earnestly strengthen ideological leadership over "Yunnan Literature and Art," which led to the emergence of Fan Qixin's erroneous remarks opposing the Party's tendency in literature and art in the publication. He also criticized his tendency to be detached from reality in his work and his petty-bourgeois viewpoints in his past creations.

Xi Rong discussed the importance of literary and art workers of intellectual origin delving into reality to carry out ideological remolding and constantly studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to improve their political and theoretical level in his article "Literary and Art Workers Must Remold Themselves," focusing on the chaotic ideological situation of many intellectuals in the Sichuan West Region.

An Chunzhen, head of the Music Department of the Southwest People's Art Institute, reviewed his blind worship of the West and purely technical viewpoints in his article "Inspection on the Implementation of Chairman Mao's Literary and Art Line" in leading the teaching work of the Music Department of the Southwest People's Art Institute. He said that the students "can create tunes and accompaniment forms that are completely Western in style, but cannot create songs with national spirit that are loved by the masses," and "they are enthusiastic about large forms and look down on mass songs, even the masterpiece 'People All Over the World Are of One Heart,' which won the second prize in the song competition at the Third World Youth Festival." The majority of the programs in the internship performances were Western etudes and dance music that the masses could not accept.

He Jianxun, head of the Chinese Department of Chongqing University, in his article "Commemorating Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' To Eliminate the Petty-Bourgeois Literary and Art Thought," Yuan Ke, a professor of literature and art at the Southwest People's Art Institute, in his article "Preliminary Inspection of My Literary and Art Teaching Thought," and Yang He, a professor of the Chinese Department of Chongqing University, in his article "Must Remold My Literary and Art Thought," all separately criticized their own petty-bourgeois thoughts and dogmatism in literary and art teaching.

Dong Chungui, one of the main leaders of the Southwest People's Art Troupe, reviewed in his article "Preliminary Examination of Our Work" the individualistic thoughts existing among the literary and art workers of the troupe. For example, when someone was assigned to play a certain role, if someone thought that they could not express themselves in the play, they would "rather not play, because they were afraid of losing the 'excellent performance' brand they had originally won"; There are also some people who "create solely for royalties, and after writing a manuscript, they are concerned about calculating how much royalties they can get and how to distribute it." "They oppose collective creation in order to avoid not being able to enjoy fame and fortune alone."

    西南文艺界进行整风学习
    西南文艺界于纪念毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年时，开始了文艺整风学习的准备工作。当日重庆新华日报发表了社论，号召文艺界在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，以毛主席的文件为武器，深入地检查文艺思想。重庆市文联亦于是日召开了纪念大会，并在会上作了准备文艺整风的动员。六月二十二日重庆市文艺界正式开始了整风运动。早在去年北京文艺界整风学习运动展开之后，西南文艺界某些单位，如西南军区战斗文工团创作研究室、西南军区某步兵学校文工团，以及云南军区全军的文艺工作者、西南人民艺术学院等，对文艺思想即已作了初步检查。在五月二十三日重庆市文联召开的西南暨重庆市的文艺工作者大会上，重庆市文联主席任白戈和副主席沙汀均作了报告。任白戈讲述了毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的伟大历史意义，以及文艺界在执行毛主席的文艺方针中所获得的成绩后，指出了西南文艺界存在的错误和缺点及其产生的原因，号召大家要认真地、自觉地进行思想改造，为贯彻毛主席的文艺方向而努力。沙汀在报告中检讨了文学艺术界联合会的一些具体工作，并希望全重庆市的文艺工作者在整风运动中，明确工人阶级的立场、思想、观点，在思想改造上取得胜利。
    新华日报和“西南文艺”都陆续发表了一部分文艺领导干部和文艺工作者的检讨性的文章。沙汀在“我对文联工作的初步检讨”一文中，检讨了他在西南和重庆市文联的领导工作中，忽视工人阶级的思想领导。他在对“西南文艺”、西南文联筹委会机关工作的领导中，忽视了对干部的思想教育，“西南文艺”发表了具有小资产阶级思想感情的作品，该刊与群众的联系也很不够。在重庆市文联的领导工作中，他忽视了群众的文艺创作活动，例如去年重庆剧协举办了一次独幕剧的征文，不足三个月的时间就收到了三百四十八件来稿，其中较好的如“老当家”、“光荣花”等都是工人的创作。沙汀说：“谁估低了它们的发展前途和它们在整个文艺事业发展中的巨大意义，谁就会犯错误。”但是他自己对这一部门的工作却极少主动的布置和检查。同时他对待“说古唱今”也采取不够负责的官僚主义态度，很少检查刊物的思想内容，以至刊物上不时出现表现小资产阶级、资产阶级思想的作品。如最近一期发表了“劳动生产当模范”，就在那里公开宣传个人名誉地位思想。
    西南军政委员会文教部副部长李长路在“电影、戏曲、文艺教学中几个问题的初步检查”一文中，指出了西南文艺批评空气的稀薄。如在西南放映电影“武训传”时，当初曾有人为它捧场，甚至鼓掌，但对这部反动影片的讨论，并未能很好展开；在戏曲的创作与演出中有反爱国主义反历史主义的倾向；在文艺教学方面，如西南人民艺术学院、西南师范学院中文系、重庆大学中文系等，都严重地存在着混乱思想。在西南人民艺术学院的文艺教学中多是搬弄资产阶级的洋教条，有人认为只有西洋的音乐和美术是科学的，中国的古代艺术与民间艺术不科学；在西南师范学院中文系，也有人死啃着废纸残堆不放；在重庆大学中文系则相当严重地存在着单纯的技术观点与教条主义的教学观点。
    西南军区“战斗文工团”团长陈播在“我的检讨”中，检讨了由于自己并未在长期战斗环境中彻底地进行思想改造，因而在进城之后没有抵抗得住资产阶级思想的影响和袭击，以致给部队的文艺工作招来了损失。如由于不适当的注意“战斗文工团”的“专业化”，盲目的扩大组织、采购不必要的物资，错误地想把文工团建设成一个学院的样子，把资料室建设成小博物馆式的。而对于西南部队的英雄人物和英雄事迹，却很少创作和演出。
    云南省文学艺术界联合会筹备委员会主任委员徐嘉瑞在“纪念毛主席‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’发表十周年”一文中，检讨了他在云南文联筹委会机关领导工作中，忽视了文艺工作者到实际斗争中去进行思想改造的重要性。当文联筹委会有大批干部下乡参加减租退押斗争时，他就嚷着：“文联的人都调空了，工作没有办法推动。”对“云南文艺”，未能认真从思想上加强领导，以至刊物上出现了范启新反对文艺中有党的倾向性的错误言论。他还批判了自己在工作中脱离实际的倾向和过去在创作中的小资产阶级观点。
    西戎在“文艺工作者必须改造自己”一文中，就川西区许多知识分子出身的文艺工作者的混乱思想情况，论述了知识分子出身的文艺工作者必须深入实际进行思想改造，并且要不断地学习马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想，以提高自己的政治理论水平的重要性。
    西南人民艺术学院音乐系系主任安春振在“在执行毛主席文艺路线上的检查”一文中，检讨了他在领导西南人民艺术学院音乐系的教学工作中的盲目崇拜西洋和单纯技术观点。他说，同学们“可以创作出完全西洋风格的曲调与伴奏形式，而不能创作出有民族气派的为群众所喜爱的歌曲。”，“他们热衷于大的形式，看不起群众歌曲，甚至连荣获第三届世界青年联欢节歌曲比赛二等奖的‘全世界人民心一条’这样的杰作都看不上眼。”在实习演出的节目中，占了大部分的是群众不能接受的西洋的练习曲、舞曲。
    重庆大学中文系系主任何剑熏在“纪念毛主席‘在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’要肃清小资产阶级的文艺思想”一文中、西南人民艺术学院文艺教授袁珂在“初步检查我的文艺教学思想”一文中、重庆大学中文系教授杨禾在“必须改造我的文艺思想”一文中，都分别批判了他们自己的小资产阶级的思想，和文艺教学中的教条主义。
    西南人民文工团主要领导人之一的董春贵在“初步检查我们的工作”一文中，检讨了该团的文艺工作者中存在着的个人主义思想，如分配某人饰演某角色时，若被某人认为在这戏中是不能表现自己的，则“宁愿不演，原因是怕丢掉自己原来争得的‘表演出色’的牌子”；还有的人是“专为稿费而创作，写好一篇稿子之后就牵心挂肠的计算能得多少稿费，怎样分配花用”，“他们反对集体创作，为的是怕不能独享名利。”
