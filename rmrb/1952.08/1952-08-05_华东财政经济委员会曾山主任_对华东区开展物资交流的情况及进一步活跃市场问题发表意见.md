    Zeng Shan, Director of the East China Financial and Economic Committee,
    Expresses His Opinions on the Development of Material Exchange in the East China Region and Further Invigorating the Market

    Recently, a Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed Zeng Shan, Vice Chairman of the East China Military and Administrative Committee and Director of the East China Military and Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee, regarding the development of material exchange in the East China region and how to further invigorate the market in the future, and asked him to express his opinions.

    Director Zeng Shan told the reporter: Around the summer harvest this year, the East China region convened relatively widespread urban-rural material exchange conferences. This is a region-wide movement to invigorate the market. The purpose of this movement is to, on the basis of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, strive for the rapid and healthy prosperity of the entire region's market, and create favorable conditions for the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement and the country's large-scale economic construction. Director Zeng Shan pointed out: After two months of effort, this movement has achieved great success. The entire region's market has begun to recover and become active since May, and the current transaction volume has reached and partially exceeded the level of the same period last year. The sluggish market situation that once appeared in March and April, and the disconnection between urban and rural materials at the beginning of the summer harvest, have been changed. Urban production has returned to normal, worker employment has increased, farmers' incomes have improved, and private industrialists and businessmen have also eliminated their misperceptions of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and greatly increased their operating confidence and enthusiasm. This has not only powerfully promoted industrial and agricultural production and prospered the economy, but also, on the basis of eliminating the "three evils" and "five poisons" of the old society, further enhanced the unity between the People's Government and the people of all classes.

    Director Zeng Shan briefly explained that the main reasons for the great achievements of this material exchange work are: First, after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements basically ended, the East China Military and Administrative Committee and the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee promptly proposed to vigorously develop material exchange, invigorate the market, and develop production as the central task for future work. It also called on leading cadres at all levels to strengthen their leadership over commerce and earnestly change the tendency in some cadres of paying attention only to industrial and agricultural production and neglecting commerce. At the same time, governments at all levels in East China have universally established urban-rural material exchange committees and their offices to be responsible for specifically guiding the implementation of this work. The responsible persons of party committees at all levels and government leaders were able to personally get involved, understand the situation, grasp policies, and mobilize all relevant departments to divide labor, cooperate, and act in unison. This is the basic key to the successful development of this material exchange work. Second, before the material exchange conferences, local governments convened consultation meetings and meetings of representatives of industry and commerce, repeatedly explaining the People's Government's policy of taking both public and private interests into account and encouraging private industrialists and businessmen to engage in legitimate business operations, eliminating the various doubts and wait-and-see attitudes of some private industrialists and businessmen caused by the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and encouraging them to actively participate in material exchange activities. At the same time, policy education was continuously conducted among cadres to correct the thinking of some cadres, especially financial and economic cadres, who were unwilling to deal with private merchants and blindly took on everything after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. This ensured the correct implementation of the material exchange policy, so that material exchange conferences in various places achieved good results, not only universally exceeding the original planned transaction figures, but also achieving normal proportions in the proportion of public and private, the proportion of purchase and sale, and the proportion of industrial products and agricultural products. Third, the leading role of the state-owned economy was correctly brought into play in the material exchange conferences at all levels, and a series of measures were taken to encourage and support private industrialists and businessmen to actively participate in material exchange. For example, at exchange conferences in various places, state-owned companies and cooperatives took the lead in purchasing and helping to sell unsalable goods, giving priority and convenience to private enterprises in purchasing best-selling goods as much as possible, and using famous brands to drive the sales of non-famous brands and unsalable goods. At the same time, trade companies adjusted regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences; the People's Bank actively handled mortgage financing, expanded loans, and reduced interest rates; and tax authorities appropriately adjusted taxes and gave consideration to illegal industrial and commercial households in the issue of returning money and compensating for taxes. All of these have played a great role in invigorating the market and promoting material exchange.

    Regarding how to further develop material exchange in the future, Director Zeng Shan put forward four points: First, it must be recognized that material exchange conferences are not only an effective way to invigorate the market, but also an important organizational form for the state-owned economy to combine with cooperatives to lead private merchants in commercial activities. They should be held not only in the off-season, but also in the peak season. In the future, East China plans to convene such conferences at all levels three times a year, before and after the summer harvest, before and after the autumn harvest, and during the Spring Festival, to make them a regular system. Second, regions that have already held material exchange conferences should focus on consolidating the results of the conferences, ensuring the fulfillment of contracts, guiding production in a planned way, organizing exchanges, and paying attention to new market conditions, discovering problems, and solving them. Regions that have not yet universally held material exchange conferences should continue to convene them according to local production and sales conditions, material circulation laws, and the needs of the masses. In particular, vigorously organizing material exchange in primary markets below the county level should become the focus of future work. Because only when the primary market is truly active can material exchange be smoothly developed. Danyang County in southern Jiangsu has adopted the form of temple fairs and bazaars familiar to the masses, focusing on retail sales and conducting short-distance exchanges, allowing producers and consumers to meet directly. This method can be universally applied in primary material exchange. Third, conscientiously grasp policies, continue to correct the pure profit-seeking views of some state-owned enterprises and cooperative cadres and the thinking of blindly taking over everything, earnestly take care of the interests of production, transportation, and sales, correctly grasp the proportion of public and private in various materials, and appropriately adjust regional, seasonal, and wholesale and retail price differences to prevent excessively high or low phenomena. In addition, some market management measures that were formulated in the past under price fluctuations should also be appropriately revised according to the current situation to facilitate material exchange. Fourth, in order to achieve the goal of smooth flow of goods, state-owned companies and cooperatives, as well as banks, transportation, taxation, and other departments, must improve their operations, cooperate closely, and jointly serve material exchange. People's Banks in various places should continue to expand and strengthen loans to private industrialists and businessmen and implement the policy of reducing interest rates; tax authorities must proceed from the perspective of benefiting production and exchange in taxation and strictly abide by tax regulations; transportation departments should effectively improve transportation efficiency, reasonably adjust freight rates, and minimize cargo transportation levels, so as to remove obstacles from all aspects and promote material exchange.

    Finally, Director Zeng Shan pointed out: After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the production of industrial products has been significantly improved, and summer crops have generally reported bumper harvests. If we can strive for a bumper harvest in autumn, the prosperity of the market in the future is very promising. He called on all state-owned trading companies and cooperatives to actively improve their operations and better unite and lead private industrialists and businessmen, continue to do a good job in bringing industrial products to the countryside and purchasing agricultural products, and private industrialists and businessmen should continue to eliminate the "five poisons" and actively engage in legitimate production and operation that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood under the leadership of the state-owned economy, in order to more deeply and extensively develop material exchange work in the entire region and strive for an earlier, healthier, and more prosperous arrival of this year's market boom.

    华东财政经济委员会曾山主任
    对华东区开展物资交流的情况及进一步活跃市场问题发表意见
    新华社记者最近就华东区开展物资交流的情况及今后如何进一步活跃市场的问题访问华东军政委员会副主席，华东军政委员会财政经济委员会主任曾山，并请他发表意见。
    曾山主任告诉记者：今年夏收前后，华东区比较普遍地召开了城乡物资交流大会，这是一个全区规模的活跃市场运动；这个运动的目的，是在“三反”、“五反”运动的基础上，争取全区市场迅速地、健康地繁荣起来，为增产节约运动和国家大规模经济建设创造有利条件。曾山主任指出：经过两个月来的努力，这个运动已获得很大胜利。全区市场自五月份起即已开始恢复活跃，目前交易额已达到并部分地超过了去年同期的水平。今年三、四月份曾经一度出现的市场呆滞情况及夏收开始时城乡物资互相脱节的现象，已经改变。城市生产已恢复正常，工人就业增加，农民收入有了改善，私营工商业者也消除了对“三反”、“五反”运动的错觉，并大大地提高了经营信心与积极性。这不但有力地促进了工农业生产，繁荣了经济，而且在消除旧社会“三害”、“五毒”的基础上，更加增进了人民政府与各阶级人民的团结。
    曾山主任扼要地说明了此次华东物资交流工作取得如此巨大成绩的主要原因是：一、在“三反”、“五反”基本结束后，华东军政委员会及中共中央华东局即及时地提出了以大力开展物资交流，活跃市场，发展生产，作为今后工作的中心任务。并号召各级领导干部加强对商业的领导，切实转变过去在某些干部中只注意工农业生产而忽视商业的倾向。同时，华东各级政府均普遍建立了城乡物资交流委员会及其办公室，负责具体指导该项工作的进行，各级党委的负责人及政府首长都能亲自动手，了解情况，掌握政策，并动员各有关部门，分工合作，一致行动，这是此次物资交流工作胜利开展的基本关键。二、各地在物资交流大会之前，都由政府召开了协商会议和工商界代表会议，反复说明了人民政府公私兼顾及鼓励私营工商业从事正当经营的各项政策，消除了某些私营工商业者因“三反”、“五反”而产生的各种疑虑与观望等待情绪，并鼓励他们踊跃参加物资交流的活动。同时，又在干部中不断地进行了政策教育，纠正了部分干部特别是财经干部在“三反”、“五反”后不愿同私商打交道和盲目包办一切的思想，这样就保证了物资交流政策的正确贯彻，使各地物资交流大会都取得良好效果，不但在交易数字上普遍超过原定计划，而且在公私比重，购销比重，工业品与农业品比重上都达到了正常的比例。三、在各级物资交流会议中正确的发挥了国营经济的领导作用，并采取了一系列的措施，鼓励与支持私营工商业者积极参加物资交流。如各地交流大会上，国营公司及合作社带头购入和帮助推销滞销货品，对私营企业采购畅销品尽量给以优先及便利，并以名牌热货带动私商非名牌滞销货；同时贸易公司调整了地区差价及批发与零售差价；人民银行积极办理押汇，扩大贷款，降低利息；税收机关适当地调整了税收，并对违法工商业户在退财补税问题上给以照顾。所有这些，对活跃市场，推动物资交流都起了极大作用。
    对于今后如何进一步开展物资交流，曾山主任提出四点意见：一、必须认识物资交流大会不仅是活跃市场的一种有效办法，而且是国营经济结合合作社领导私商进行商业活动的一种重要的组织形式，不但在淡季需要召开，在旺季亦应举行。今后华东各地每年拟分夏收前后，秋收前后和春节三次逐级召开这种大会，使其成为经常性的制度。二、已经开过物资交流大会的地区，今后要着重巩固会议成果，保证合同的履行，有计划地指导生产，组织交流，并注意市场的新情况，发现问题，加以解决。凡尚未普遍召开物资交流大会的地区，应按各地产销情况，物资流转规律及群众需要，继续召开；特别是大力组织县以下初级市场的物资交流，应成为今后工作的重点。因为只有初级市场真正活跃起来，物资交流才能得到顺畅地发展。苏南丹阳县采取群众习惯的庙会、集场形式，以零售为主，进行短距离交流，使生产者与消费者直接见面的办法，可在初级物资交流中普遍加以运用。三、认真掌握政策，继续纠正部分国营企业、合作社干部的单纯营利观点及盲目包下来的思想，切实照顾产、运、销三方面的利益，正确掌握在各种不同物资中的公私比重，适当地调整地区、季节、批发与零售的差价，防止偏高与偏低的现象。此外，对过去在物价波动下所规定的一些市场管理办法，也应根据目前情况，适当地加以修正，以利物资交流。四、为了达到货畅其流的目的，国营公司和合作社及银行、交通、税务等部门必须改进业务，通力合作，共同为物资交流服务。各地人民银行应继续扩大与加强对私营工商业的贷款，并贯彻降低利息政策；税务机关在征税中必须从有利于生产及交流出发，严格按照税章办事；交通部门应切实提高运输效率，合理地调整运价，尽量减少货运层次，以便从各方面扫除障碍，促进物资交流。
    最后，曾山主任指出：经过“三反”、“五反”，工业品生产已有显著提高，夏季农作物普告丰收，如果再能争取秋季丰收，今后市场的繁荣是大有希望的。他号召：各国营贸易公司及合作社应积极改进业务，并更好地团结与领导私营工商业，继续作好工业品下乡和农产品收购工作，私营工商业者应继续消除“五毒”，在国营经济领导下，积极从事有利国计民生的正当生产与经营，以求把全区物资交流工作更深入、更广泛地开展起来，争取今年市场旺季更早、更健康、更繁荣的到来。（新华社）
