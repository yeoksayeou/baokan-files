    "August 1st" Sports Games
    Selected Program Performance Schedule Changes
    (1) The acrobatic performance evening at the Temple of Agriculture on the 23rd has been postponed to 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM on the 26th due to rain. The acrobatic performance evening on the 22nd has been postponed to 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM on the 27th due to a power outage.
    (2) The programs at the Labor Theater on the 22nd and 23rd could not be performed due to rain. Now, because the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Performing Arts Troupe and the major military region performing arts troupes are eager to return to their original garrison locations to perform, and due to limited venue time, the performances cannot be continued. Audiences who purchased tickets for these performances should return them for a full refund at the Labor Theater ticket office between 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM on August 24th and 25th. All issued invitation tickets will be voided.

    “八一”体育运动大会
    精选节目表演程序有变更
    （一）先农坛二十三日杂技表演晚会因雨延至二十六日下午四时至六时半补演，二十二日杂技晚会因停电延至二十七日下午四时至六时半补演。
    （二）劳动剧场二十二、二十三两日的节目因雨未能演出，现因志愿军文工团及各大军区文工团急于返回原驻地演出，又因场地时间所限，所以不能续演，买该场入场券的观众请在八月二十四日、二十五日两天上午十二时至下午六时在劳动剧场售票处照原价退票，所发招待券一律作废。
