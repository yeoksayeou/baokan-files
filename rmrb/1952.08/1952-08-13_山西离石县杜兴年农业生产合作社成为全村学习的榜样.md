    Duxingnian Agricultural Producers Cooperative in Lishi County, Shanxi Province Becomes a Model for the Whole Village to Learn From

    Editor: Our agricultural producers cooperative was established on the basis of three years of mutual aid movement. However, when it was first established, only a few members recognized the significance of the agricultural producers cooperative. Others joined the cooperative to "respond to the call," and some joined to "give it a try." For the past four months, Comrade Du Xingnian (deputy secretary of the village party branch), the director of the cooperative, has led us in both production and learning. Everyone's ideological understanding and production skills have been continuously improved, and they have personally experienced the benefits of collective production.

    In the past, the farmers in our village only knew how to farm according to the old methods passed down from their ancestors, so production developed very slowly. In the past two or three years, mutual aid groups were established, and production techniques were emphasized, and agricultural production had reached the level before the Anti-Japanese War. In this way, people felt that they were "doing fine," that they had exhausted their human methods and the strength of the land, and that production could not be improved further. After the establishment of the agricultural producers cooperative, we learned from the advanced production experience of Li Shunda, a national model worker, improved our fertilization methods, used pesticides to kill insects, and borrowed money from the bank to purchase some means of production. In this way, our production technology has been improved again, and the output is expected to continue to increase (the general autumn field is planned to increase by one dou per mu, and the high-yield field is to increase by four dou per mu), and the villagers began to realize that the human methods and the strength of the land are inexhaustible. In the past, the women in the village always relied on men for their livelihood. This year, eleven women have joined the agricultural producers cooperative. The agricultural producers cooperative implements the method of distributing dividends according to work points, which encourages the women's enthusiasm for production. Woman Liu Donglin said: "In the past, women's work was buried, but now they are given the same work points as men, which shows our strength! It is really equality between men and women, who would want to not work again?" A women's production group was formed in this cooperative. With this production army, the land in the cooperative was cultivated earlier and better than in previous years. In addition, the members of the cooperative attach great importance to political and cultural learning. They read newspapers and recognize new characters in the fields every day. In the past four months, most people have learned 100 to 200 characters. Old lady Liang Chou Deng said: "My son used to be lazy in his work, but after joining the agricultural producers cooperative, he has changed for the better by sleeping late and getting up early." Old farmer Li Changsheng used to be unwilling to attend meetings and disliked listening to the talks, but now he automatically goes to participate when he hears that there will be a meeting of the agricultural producers cooperative. The villagers said: "The agricultural producers cooperative is really a school for farmers, and whoever enters it will improve." They also said: "The agricultural producers cooperative is really a guiding light, and there is a bright future if you follow it."

### 山西离石县杜兴年农业生产合作社成为全村学习的榜样

    山西离石县杜兴年农业生产合作社成为全村学习的榜样
    编辑同志：我们的农业生产合作社是在三年的互助运动的基础上成立起来的。但在刚刚成立时，只有少数社员认识了农业生产合作社的意义，其他社员，有的是为了“响应号召”入社的，有的是为了“试试看”入社的。四个月来，社主任杜兴年同志（中共村支部副书记）领导我们一面生产，一面学习，大家的思想认识和生产技术都不断提高，并且亲身体验到集体生产的好处了。
    我们村的农民过去只知道照先人传下来的老法子种地，因此生产发展的很慢。近两三年来成立了互助组，讲究了生产技术，农业生产已达到抗日战争前的水平。这样，人们就觉着“行了”，人的办法已经想尽了，地的力量也出尽了，生产不能再提高了。农业生产合作社成立以后，我们学习了全国著名劳动模范李顺达的先进生产经验，改进了施肥办法，用药剂杀虫，又向银行贷款置购了一些生产资料。这样，我们的生产技术又提高了，产量可望继续增加（一般秋田计划每亩增产一斗，丰产田每亩要增产四斗），村里人开始认识了人的办法和地的力量都是用不尽的道理。过去村里妇女们老是依靠男人生活。今年有十一个妇女参加了农业生产合作社。农业生产合作社实行按工分红的办法，鼓励了妇女的生产积极性。妇女刘东林说：“过去妇女做了活也埋没了，现在和男人同样记工分红，可显出我们的力量来啦！真是男女平等了，谁还愿再不劳动？”这个社内组成了妇女生产组。有了这支生产军，社内的土地比往年耕的又早又好。此外，社员们对政治文化学习非常重视，每天在地头读报认生字，四个月来一般人已认识了一百到二百多字了。老太太梁丑蹬说：“我的儿子过去劳动不紧，参加了农业生产合作社后，迟睡早起可改变好了。”老农李长胜过去老不愿开会嫌听话麻烦，现在他一听说开农业生产合作社会，就自动地去参加。村里的人们说：“农业生产合作社真是农民的学堂，谁进去谁有长进。”又说：“农业生产合作社真是个指路灯，跟上就有光明前途。”山西离石县马家梁村杜兴年  农业生产合作社全体社员
