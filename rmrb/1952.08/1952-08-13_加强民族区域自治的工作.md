    Strengthening the Work of National Regional Autonomy

    The 18th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee approved the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China," and it was promulgated and implemented by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government. For China, a multi-ethnic country, this is a measure of great historical significance. This will further consolidate our great motherland—the big family of unity, friendship, and cooperation among all ethnic groups, and will guarantee that the people of all ethnic groups in our country will move towards a more prosperous and happier life.

    National regional autonomy is the basic policy of Chairman Mao Zedong in solving the ethnic issues in China by applying the Marxist-Leninist theory on ethnic issues. This policy is specifically embodied in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and is consistently followed by the people's governments at all levels in our country. In the implementation of this policy over the past three years, great achievements have been made. According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of June this year, about 130 ethnic autonomous regions at all levels have been established nationwide, with a minority population of about 4.5 million people in various autonomous regions. In the past three years, we have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of striving for the unity and development of all ethnic groups. Like the great victories in all aspects of our country's construction, we have also completed tasks in just two or three years that could not be completed in decades or even hundreds of years in the past in all aspects of minority people's participation in political power, becoming masters of their own affairs, transforming the ethnic relations of mutual discrimination and hatred into relations of unity and friendship, and in the development of the economic and cultural life of minority people.

    At present, a thriving new atmosphere unprecedented in history has emerged in all places where national regional autonomy has been implemented. Because the ethnic groups implementing regional autonomy have realized their right to be masters of their own affairs, their enthusiasm and initiative have been brought into play, the internal unity of the ethnic groups has been strengthened, the relations between ethnic groups have been harmonious and friendly, bandits have been wiped out, production has developed, the financial income of autonomous regions has increased, cultural and educational undertakings have been rapidly restored and developed, a large number of ethnic cadres have grown up, the people's living standards have been improved, and the people of all ethnic groups have been increasingly growing with infinite love for Chairman Mao and our motherland. For example, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in just five years, the population of the Inner Mongolia ethnic group has stopped declining in pastoral areas and has begun to rise in agricultural areas and some pastoral areas; the number of livestock in pastoral areas has increased by nearly one time compared with before liberation, which would normally take fifteen to twenty years to achieve. Agricultural output has exceeded the pre-liberation level, the people's purchasing power has greatly increased, and they have accumulated funds to start industrial construction. The poverty and weakness of the Inner Mongolia ethnic group caused by ethnic oppression and the reactionary rule within the ethnic group for hundreds of years has become a thing of the past, and now there is a vibrant scene of development everywhere. Other ethnic autonomous regions have also achieved roughly the same good results.

    What is the experience we have gained in promoting the work of national regional autonomy in the past few years? The most basic experience is: First, the implementation of national regional autonomy and the construction of autonomous regions must be possible under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government; and the implementation of regional autonomy at the same time makes the people of all ethnic groups love the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government even more. Second, the ethnic groups implementing regional autonomy, through their own ethnic forms, using their own ethnic cadres, fully exercising their autonomous rights as masters of their own affairs, and developing local construction undertakings in accordance with the wishes of the people of their own ethnic group and the leaders connected with the people, can highly promote the enthusiasm and initiative of the people of their own ethnic group, and make the work of autonomous regions in all aspects achieve rapid development. Third, the implementation of national regional autonomy depends on the unity and mutual assistance of all ethnic groups within the autonomous region and the assistance of the Han people throughout the country, and the implementation of regional autonomy at the same time will inevitably further strengthen the unity and mutual assistance between ethnic groups.

    The "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" was formulated under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought on the basis of these experiences of national work on a national scale over the past three years. According to the provisions of the general principles of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China," national regional autonomy must be implemented within the big family of the People's Republic of China, it must be implemented under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, it must follow the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and it is regional autonomy based on the areas where minority ethnic groups live in concentrated communities. This is a general principle that is completely in line with the common interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. We must never have any wavering about this general principle. Anyone who deviates from this general principle violates the common interests of the people of all ethnic groups, and also violates the interests of the people of their own ethnic group, and he must make mistakes. According to this general principle, all ethnic minorities living in concentrated communities have the right to implement national regional autonomy, establish autonomous regions and autonomous organs, and manage the internal affairs of their own ethnic group in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people of their own ethnic group and the leaders connected with the people. This is the right of ethnic minorities to be masters of their own affairs, and we must help them realize this right. This is also an unshakeable principle. All thoughts and practices that ignore the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities are wrong and must be overcome. The "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" also stipulates the principles for dealing with issues such as the ethnic composition, regional boundaries, administrative status, autonomous organs, autonomous rights, internal relations, and upper and lower relations of autonomous regions. These principles are of great significance for correctly promoting the policy of national regional autonomy. By correctly implementing these principles, we will definitely be able to greatly advance the work of ethnic regional autonomy.

    Of course, we should also see that there are still some problems in the current ethnic work, the most important of which is that some cadres ignore the characteristics of various ethnic groups and are not good at combining the basic spirit of the Common Program with the specific conditions of various ethnic regions, but simply apply the experiences and methods of the Han areas. This is basically because these cadres lack a correct understanding and deep understanding of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy. Therefore, when the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China" is announced, we ask cadres of all ethnic groups across the country, especially those working in ethnic minority areas, to launch a study movement of ethnic policies, conduct in-depth and serious study and research on this important document, summarize our rich experience in ethnic work, correct our own incorrect understanding, and improve our level of ethnic policies. Places that have already implemented regional autonomy should, in accordance with the principles and spirit of this outline, check and improve the work of their respective regions, so as to fully exercise the autonomous rights granted by the state and give fuller play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the autonomous regions. The people's governments at the higher levels of the ethnic autonomous regions should, in accordance with the provisions of this outline, strengthen and improve their leadership over the ethnic autonomous regions under their jurisdiction. In ethnic minority areas where regional autonomy has not yet been implemented, the people's governments at the higher levels should, in accordance with this outline and the specific conditions of the local area, formulate practical and feasible plans and programs for the implementation of national regional autonomy, and gradually establish autonomous regions. In the process of actively promoting national regional autonomy, we should also prevent the hasty and rash practices of simply pursuing the number of autonomous regions and simply changing names.

    At the 18th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, Ulanhu, Vice Chairman of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, said in the "Report on the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China": "The minority ethnic groups in China have suffered from the pain of ethnic oppression throughout history. Since the founding of New China, they have gained liberation. It is believed that the passage and promulgation of the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy, a document of great historical significance, will bring infinite light and happiness to all ethnic groups. All minority ethnic groups across the country will be cheered by this, and will be more grateful to the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao!" This represents the heartfelt joy and firm confidence of nearly 40 million minority ethnic groups in our country. We celebrate the promulgation of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China," and we must actively strengthen the work of national regional autonomy, strive to fully implement this outline, and strive to further promote the cause of unity and development of all ethnic groups in our country!

### 加强民族区域自治的工作

    加强民族区域自治的工作
    中央人民政府委员会第十八次会议批准了“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”，并由中央人民政府毛泽东主席明令公布施行。对于多民族的中国，这是一个具有重大历史意义的措施。这将使我们伟大的祖国——各民族人民团结友爱合作的大家庭日趋巩固，这将保证我国各民族人民走向更加繁荣和幸福生活的道路。
    民族的区域自治是毛泽东主席运用马克思、列宁主义关于民族问题的学说来解决中国民族问题的基本政策。这个政策具体地表现在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中，为我国各级人民政府所一致遵行。这个政策在近三年来的实施中，已经有了巨大的成就。据不完全的统计，截至今年六月底为止，全国已建立了各级民族自治区约一百三十个，各自治区内的少数民族人口约四百五十万人。三年来，我们在为各族人民的团结和发展而奋斗的事业中，取得了辉煌的成就。如同我国各方面建设事业的伟大胜利一样，在少数民族人民参加政权，当家作主，转变互相歧视、仇视的民族关系为团结友爱的关系，以及在少数民族人民经济、文化生活发展的各方面，我们在短短的两三年间也完成了历史上几十年甚至几百年所不能完成的任务。
    目前凡是实行了民族区域自治的地方，都出现了历史上空前未有的欣欣向荣的新气象。由于实行区域自治的民族实现了自己当家作主的权利，他们的积极性和自动精神发扬起来了，民族内部团结了，民族之间的关系融洽友爱了，土匪被肃清了，生产发展了，自治区的财政收入增加了，文教事业迅速恢复和发展了，各民族的干部大批地成长起来了，人民的生活得到改善了，各民族人民对于毛主席和我们的祖国日益增涨着无限的热爱。如内蒙古自治区，在短短的五年间，已经使内蒙古民族的人口在牧业区停止下降，在农业区和部分牧业区开始上升；牧业区的牲畜数目较之解放前增加了将近一倍，这在过去通常条件下是需要十五年到二十年才能达到的。农业的产量已经超过了解放前的水平，人民的购买力大大提高，并积累了资金，开始着手工业建设。几百年来民族压迫和民族内部反动统治所造成的内蒙古民族的贫困和衰弱状况已成为过去，现在则到处是蓬勃发展的青春景象。其他民族自治区也都得到了大致相同的良好效果。
    几年来我们在推行民族区域自治的工作中所得到的经验是什么呢？最基本的经验是：第一，民族区域自治的实行和自治区的建设，一定要在中国共产党和人民政府的领导之下才是可能的；而区域自治的实行，同时就使各民族人民对于中国共产党和人民政府更加热爱。第二，实施区域自治的民族，通过自己的民族形式，使用自己的民族干部，充分行使自己当家作主的自治权利，按照本民族人民及与人民有联系的领袖人物的志愿发展地方的建设事业，就能够高度发扬本民族人民的积极性和自动精神，使自治区各方面的工作获得迅速的发展。第三，民族区域自治的实行，有赖于自治区内部各民族的团结互助以及全国汉族人民的帮助，而区域自治的实行同时又必然会进一步加强各民族之间的团结互助。
    “中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”就是在三年来全国规模的民族工作的这些经验的基础上，在马克思、列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指导下制定的。按照“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”总则的规定，民族的区域自治必须是在中华人民共和国这个民族大家庭之中来实行的，必须是在中央人民政府统一领导之下来实行的，它必须遵循着中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，它是以少数民族聚居区为基础的区域自治。这是完全符合于全国各民族人民共同利益的一个总原则。对于这个总原则我们决不应该有任何的动摇。任何人离开了这个总原则，就是违背了各民族人民的共同利益，也就是违背了本民族人民的利益，他就一定要犯错误。依据这个总原则，一切聚居的少数民族，都有权利实行民族的区域自治，建立自治区和自治机关，按照本民族大多数人民及与人民有联系的领袖人物的志愿，管理本民族的内部事务。这是少数民族当家作主的权利，我们必须帮助他们实现这种权利，这同样是不可动摇的原则。一切忽视少数民族自治权利的思想和作法都是错误的，必须加以克服。“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”还规定了关于自治区的民族组成、区域界线、行政地位、自治机关、自治权利、内部关系和上下关系等问题的各项处理原则。这些原则对于正确地推行民族区域自治政策都具有重大的意义。正确地执行这些原则，我们就一定能够把各民族区域自治的工作大大地向前推进一步。
    当然，我们也应该看到，目前民族工作中还存在着一些问题，其中最主要的问题是某些干部忽视各民族的特点，不善于把共同纲领的基本精神和各个民族地区的具体情况相结合，而简单地搬用汉族地区的经验和办法。这基本上是由于这些干部对于毛主席的民族政策缺乏正确的了解和深刻的体会所致。因此，在“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”公布的时候，我们要求全国各民族的干部，特别是在少数民族地区工作的干部，展开一个民族政策的学习运动，对于这个重要文件作深入而认真的学习和研究，总结我们在民族工作方面丰富的经验，纠正自己不正确的认识，把自己的民族政策的水平提高一步。已经实行了区域自治的地方，更应该根据这个纲要的原则和精神，检查和改进各该地区的工作，以便充分行使国家所赋予的自治权利，更高度地发挥各自治区的积极性和创造性。各民族自治区的上级人民政府应根据这个纲要的规定，加强和改善自己对于所属的民族自治区的领导工作。凡未实行区域自治的民族聚居区，其上级人民政府应根据这个纲要和当地的具体条件，订出实施民族区域自治的切实可行的计划和方案，逐步地把自治区建立起来。在积极推行民族区域自治的过程中，我们同时也应该防止简单地追求自治区数字和简单地改换名称的急躁轻率的作法。
    中央民族事务委员会乌兰夫副主任委员在中央人民政府委员会第十八次会议上“关于中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要的报告”中说：“中国境内的少数民族历史上受尽了民族压迫的痛苦，新中国成立以来，获得了翻身与解放，相信民族区域自治实施纲要这一具有重大历史意义的文件的通过和颁布，将更给各民族带来无限光明和幸福，全国各少数民族将为此欢欣鼓舞，更感谢中央人民政府，更感谢毛主席！”这是代表了我国近四千万少数民族的衷心的喜悦和坚决的信心的宣言。我们庆贺“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”的公布，我们必须积极加强民族区域自治的工作，为完满地实现这一纲要而努力，为把我国各民族的团结和发展的事业更向前推进一步而奋斗！
