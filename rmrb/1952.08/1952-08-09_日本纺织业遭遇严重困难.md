Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 4th (TASS dispatch): As a result of the United States forcing the Japanese textile industry to abandon the Chinese market, and Britain and its colonies restricting imports of Japanese textiles, the Japanese textile industry has encountered serious difficulties. According to a report from the Japanese Kyodo News Agency, last year the value of Japanese textiles exported to Singapore, Kenya, Nigeria, Malaya, Hong Kong, Ceylon, and other places reached US$100,225,900, accounting for 17 percent of Japan's total textile exports. Due to the restrictions imposed by the British government and its colonial governments, Japan's textile exports, which reached 1.086 billion yards in 1951, will decrease to 800 million yards this year. Japanese textile industrialists have been forced to sell 70 percent of their textiles on the domestic market.

    日本纺织业遭遇严重困难
    【新华社讯】塔斯社东京四日电：由于美国强迫日本纺织业放弃中国市场以及英国与其殖民地限制日本纺织品进口的结果，日本纺织工业遭到严重的困难。据日本共同社消息，去年日本输往新加坡、怯尼亚、尼日利亚、马来亚、香港、锡兰等地的纺织品的价值达一亿零二百二十五万九千美元，占日本纺织品出口总额的百分之十七。由于英国及其殖民地国政府加以限制的结果，在一九五一年曾达十亿零八千六百码的日本纺织品的出口额今年将减至八亿码。日本的纺织工业家不得不将百分之七十的纺织品在国内市场销售。
