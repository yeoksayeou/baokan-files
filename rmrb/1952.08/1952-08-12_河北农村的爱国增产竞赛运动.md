The patriotic agricultural production increase movement in most areas of Hebei Province has spread widely from specific points to the entire area, and unprecedented new phenomena have emerged in agricultural production and the lives of farmers. After the Hebei Provincial Labor Model Representative Conference launched the Thousand Villages and Ten Thousand Groups Model High-Yield Movement last winter, a tendency to "emphasize high yields on small plots of land and disregard universal production increases" occurred in some areas. The high-yield movement was limited to a few high-yield models and villages, and did not fully expand. In May of this year, the Hebei Provincial People's Government convened a commissioner conference, summarized the experience of the Thousand Villages and Ten Thousand Groups Model High-Yield Movement, and re-proposed the slogan "Universally Launch Patriotic Agricultural Production Increase Competition Movement," demanding "a universal increase in unit area yield and a focus on cultivating high-yield models." The one-sided views of many cadres and masses on the production increase movement have since been gradually overcome. The movement has moved from a period of dormancy to activity, and from being limited to a few models to full-scale development. Party organizations and people's governments at all levels implemented the policies put forward at this conference, greatly inspiring the enthusiasm of the broad masses to participate in the competition. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various regions have led the broad masses of farmers to revise or formulate practical comprehensive production increase plans, making the agricultural production increase competition a truly mass movement. As of late July, 119 counties in the province had participated in the competition between counties (there are a total of 132 counties in the province). The forms of competition are diverse. Hengshui Prefecture organized group competitions between similar areas; other prefectures mostly organized competitions in groups by counties with similar conditions. The former method is easy to grasp, while the latter is easy to evaluate. According to statistics from 115 counties, 611 districts have participated in the competition between districts. According to statistics from 125 counties, more than 30,000 villages have participated in the competition between villages (there are more than 44,000 villages in the province). There are three forms of competition between villages: 1. Villages with similar production conditions compete with each other; 2. Villages within a "pian cun" compete with each other (in various parts of Hebei, each district's administrative villages are divided into several "pian," each including several administrative villages, called "pian cun." It is not an administrative division, but is divided in this way to facilitate production leadership); 3. Several advanced villages challenge ordinary villages in the county to compete. In the three prefectures of Handan, Hengshui, and Dingxian alone, 143,797 mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives participated in the competition, accounting for 64.4 percent of the total number of groups (cooperatives) in these three prefectures. In addition, in 96 counties, more than 1,053,000 individual farmers also participated in the competition.

    The Competition Movement Unleashed the Production Enthusiasm of the Broad Masses

    In the patriotic production increase competition movement, mutual aid teams have developed greatly. According to statistics from 97 counties, the organized labor force has increased from 40 percent last year to 56.1 percent. Generally, it has increased by 10 to 20 percent in various regions. Last year, permanent mutual aid teams accounted for 20 percent of the total number of mutual aid teams in the province, and this year it has increased to 28 percent.

    The broad masses have increased production investment, "turning dry land into paddy fields," completing and exceeding the annual well-digging task in half a year. By the end of July, 114,600 brick and stone wells had been dug throughout the province, exceeding the plan by more than 90 percent. Raoyang, Hejian, and Shenxian counties, which had never had the habit of digging wells in the past, dug more than 15,000 wells this year. In many areas, the masses have adopted the method of turning dead assets into active assets, pooling money to dig wells and buy waterwheels. The Baoding Prefecture spent 14.2 billion yuan on digging wells, half of which was contributed by the farmers themselves.

    The broad masses actively invest in increasing fertilizer application, which is also an unprecedented phenomenon. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have prepared 540 million catties of fine fertilizer for farmers this year, and 301.34 million catties have been sold before the arrival of the season for applying topdressing to autumn crops and cotton. Before the start of the competition movement, the Shahe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative only sold 400,000 catties of soybean cake in three months, but within ten days after the start of the competition movement, it sold 500,000 catties of soybean cake. The Qingfengdian Station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway transported 1 million catties of fine fertilizer from outside the region, which was bought by farmers as soon as it was unloaded from the train. The amount of coarse fertilizer used by farmers in various places this year has also exceeded last year by 20 to 30 percent.

    This year, the results of harrowing to conserve soil moisture in various places have greatly exceeded those of previous years. Many areas started farming half a month earlier. The average number of harrowings has reached four to five times. The autumn crops throughout the province have been sown in a timely manner. At present, cotton seedlings and autumn crops are growing very vigorously.

    The Patriotic Production Increase Competition Movement Has Increased the Political Enthusiasm of Farmers

    At the beginning of the production increase competition movement, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses was high, but some farmers still had a tendency to bury themselves in production and not ask about politics. They did not have a clear understanding of the consistency between individual interests and national interests. They believed that "the government is calling for production increases, so it must provide loans," and some even said that the people's government "is calling for patriotic production increases in order to ask farmers to pay more burdens." These ideas hindered the development of the movement. Therefore, making every effort to carry out ideological education has become a prerequisite for the development of the movement. Facts have proved that the process of the competition movement is a process of ideological education using vivid examples. In response to the specific ideas of the masses, various places have universally carried out patriotic education, education on the direction of organization, and education on the socialist future. The rural political atmosphere has been unprecedentedly improved. This year, Raoyang had a bumper wheat harvest, and the masses hung lanterns and festoons, paraded in formation, unanimously thanked Chairman Mao, and shouted the slogans "Patriotically increase production, resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea." This year, farmers in various places are vying to pay patriotic grain, and the public grain in Daming County was fully paid in one day. Farmers are more concerned about the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and 80 percent of the substitute farming households in Cangxian Prefecture have signed substitute farming and production guarantee contracts.

    Cadres Improved Their Leadership Methods and Styles in the Competition Movement

    In the past, many cadres often put various tasks on the same level, failing to grasp the central link; or only focused on "key points" and "models," relaxing the comprehensive leadership of general areas. In the production increase competition movement, the Hebei provincial leadership emphasized that the patriotic production increase competition is the central task that overwhelms everything in rural areas before autumn, calling on all departments to fully invest in this movement; and stipulated the policy of "universally increasing production and focusing on cultivating models," and the organizational methods of "mobilizing at all levels, focusing on key points, demonstrating with models, and promoting the general."

    Under the guidance of this policy, cadres in various places gradually realized that leading the patriotic production increase competition is an important method of leading rural work, and began to master this leadership method, organizing all work into the patriotic production increase competition movement, gradually overcoming the contradictions between departmental work, temporary blitz work, and central work, and changing the phenomenon of being busy and passive. Some areas have adopted methods such as organizing visits, mutual observation, or organizing joint village inspections to give play to the role of exchanging experiences and strengthening leadership. Raoyang organized joint village inspections, and district cadres all said that they had found the way to lead, and they began to change their work style of not being thorough.

    Grasp the Central Link to Make the Movement Advance Healthily and Sustainably

    Although the scale of this year's Hebei Province Patriotic Production Increase Competition Movement is unprecedentedly grand, and the competition between counties, districts, and villages is very active, the competition between groups and households is relatively poor. In general areas, only about one-half of the total number of groups and households have participated in the competition. Some cadres who lead the competition movement still have some degree of bureaucracy and formalism. Some cadres are satisfied with the challenges and responses at the meeting, and relax in-depth organizational work. Some cadres have not combined the creation of experience and the general guidance very well, so that the movement remains in a few advanced villages. Some cadres only carry out generalized comprehensive promotion, without grasping the key points, gaining experience, and failing to form a real production increase movement. In the future, it is necessary to grasp the important link of inspection and evaluation, strengthen ideological education, exchange experiences, establish banners, gradually enrich the specific content of the competition, and continuously revise plans to make the movement gradually develop in depth.

    After the Patriotic Production Increase Competition Movement was launched, mutual aid and cooperative organizations developed rapidly, and many new problems arose. Therefore, in July, various places took the inspection and evaluation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement as the central content of leading the production increase movement.

    Now Hebei is unfolding a summer competition centered on "comparing mutual aid" and combined with "comparing grain payment," "comparing fertilizer accumulation and topdressing," "comparing summer hoeing," and "comparing pest control" on the basis of wheat evaluation. The leadership continues to carry out patriotic education and policy education for rural cadres and the broad masses of farmers, and calls on them to learn and promote production technology and advanced experience, further strengthen the leadership of the competition movement, and make the movement more in-depth and balanced. At the agricultural production conference held by the Hebei Provincial People's Government in late July, Chairman Yang Xiufeng repeatedly warned everyone: The period of great fanfare has passed, and in the future, we must take the work a step further, overcome the mistakes of bureaucracy and commandism and the deviations of formalism, and boldly and deeply mobilize and organize the masses in order to make the movement move forward non-stop.

    河北农村的爱国增产竞赛运动
    本报河北省特约记者组
    河北省大部地区的农业爱国增产运动，已经由点到面广泛展开，农业生产和农民生活出现了前所未有的新气象。去年冬天，河北省劳动模范代表大会发起了千村万组模范丰产运动以后，某些地区曾经发生了“重视小片土地丰产、轻视普遍增产”的偏向，丰产运动局限于少数丰产模范和丰产村，没有全面展开。河北省人民政府在今年五月召开了专员会议，总结了千村万组模范丰产运动的经验，重新提出“普遍开展农业爱国增产竞赛运动”的口号，要求“普遍提高单位面积产量，重点培养丰产典型”。许多干部、群众对增产运动的片面观点，从此逐渐被克服了。运动由一度沉寂走向活跃，由限于少数典型走向全面开展。各级党组织和人民政府逐级贯彻了这次会议提出的方针，大大地鼓舞了广大群众参加竞赛的热情。许多地区的农业生产合作社、互助组带动了广大农民群众，纷纷重新修订或制订了切合实际的全面增产计划，使农业增产竞赛成为真正群众性的运动。到七月下旬止，全省已有一百一十九县参加了县和县之间的竞赛（全省共一百三十二县）。竞赛的形式是多种多样的。衡水专区在相近的地区之间组织集团竞赛；其他专区多是由条件相似的县，分组协议竞赛。前一种方式便于掌握，后一种方式便于评比。根据一百十五个县的统计，参加区和区之间的竞赛的已有六百一十一个区。根据一百二十五个县的统计，参加村和村之间的竞赛的已达三万多个村（全省共四万四千多个村）。村和村之间的竞赛有三种形式：一、生产条件相似的村互相竞赛；二、片村之内的各村互相竞赛（河北各地把每个区的各个行政村分成几片，每一片包括好几个行政村，叫做“片村”。它不是一种行政区划，只是为了便于领导生产而这样划分的）；三、若干先进村向全县一般村挑战竞赛。互助组、农业生产合作社参加竞赛的，仅邯郸、衡水、定县三个专区就有十四万三千七百九十七个，占这三个专区总组（社）数的百分之六十四点四。另外，在九十六县中，有一百零五万三千多户单干农民也参加了竞赛。
    竞赛运动发挥了广大群众的生产积极性
    在爱国增产竞赛运动中，互助组有了很大的发展。据九十七个县的统计，组织起来的劳动力已由去年的百分之四十增加到百分之五十六点一。一般地区都增加了百分之十到二十。去年全省的常年互助组占互助组总数的百分之二十，今年已增加到百分之二十八。
    广大群众增加了生产投资，“变旱田为水田”，半年完成并超过了全年的打井任务。全省到七月底已凿成砖井、石井十一万四千六百眼，超过计划百分之九十以上。饶阳、河间、深县过去从来没有凿井的习惯，今年三县凿井一万五千多眼。许多地区群众采用变死财为活财的办法，凑钱打井和买水车。保定专区打井用了一百四十二亿元的资金，农民自己拿出的就占一半。
    广大群众积极投资增施肥料，这也是前所未有的现象。各地供销合作社今年为农民准备了五亿四千万斤细肥料，在大秋作物和棉花施追肥的季节到来以前，就已售出三亿零一百三十四万斤。在竞赛运动开始前，沙河县供销合作社三个月仅售出豆饼四十万斤，竞赛运动开始后十天内，就售出豆饼五十万斤。京汉路清风店车站从外区运来细肥料一百万斤，才从车上卸下来就被农民买光了。各地农民今年用的粗肥料，也超过了去年百分之二十至三十。
    今年各地农民耙地保墒成绩大大超过往年。许多地区提前半月进行耕作。耕耙次数平均达到四遍到五遍。全省大秋作物做到了适时播种。目前棉苗和大秋作物都很茁壮。
    爱国增产竞赛运动提高了农民的政治热情
    增产竞赛运动开展之初，广大群众的生产热情是高涨的，但是有些农民还是存在着埋头生产不问政治的倾向。他们对于个人利益和国家利益的一致性没有明确的认识，他们认为“政府叫增产，就得贷款”，有人甚至说人民政府“号召爱国增产是为了叫农民多拿负担”。这些思想阻碍着运动的开展。因此，全力进行思想教育，就成为运动开展的前提条件。事实证明，竞赛运动的过程就是以生动的实例进行思想教育的过程。各地针对群众的具体思想，普遍地进行了爱国主义教育、组织起来的方向教育和社会主义前途教育。农村政治气氛空前提高。饶阳今年小麦丰收，群众悬灯结彩，列队游行，一致感谢毛主席，高呼“爱国多增产，抗美援朝鲜”的口号。今年各地农民争先缴纳爱国粮，大名全县的公粮在一天内全数交齐。农民更加关心烈属军属，沧县专区百分之八十的代耕户订了代耕保产合同。
    干部在竞赛运动中改进了领导方法和作风
    过去许多干部往往把各种工作平列起来，抓不住中心环节；或者只顾“重点”“典型”，放松了对一般的地区的全面领导。在增产竞赛运动中，河北省领导方面强调指出爱国增产竞赛是秋前农村压倒一切的中心工作，号召各部门全力投入这一运动；并规定了“普遍提高产量，重点培养典型”的方针，和“层层发动、重点掌握、典型示范、推动一般”的组织方法。
    在这样的方针指导下，各地干部逐渐认识了领导爱国增产竞赛是领导农村工作的重要方法，并开始掌握了这个领导方法，把一切工作组织到爱国增产竞赛运动中去，逐渐克服着部门工作、临时突击工作和中心工作的矛盾，改变了忙乱被动的现象。有的地区采用组织参观、互相观摩或组织联村检查等方法，发挥了交流经验，加强领导的作用。饶阳组织了联村检查，区干部都说找着了领导门路，他们开始改变了工作不深入的作风。
    抓紧中心环节，使运动健康而持久地前进
    今年河北省爱国增产竞赛运动的规模虽然是空前壮阔，县区村的竞赛虽然很活跃，组、户的竞赛却较差，一般地区只有占总组数、总户数的二分之一左右的互助组和农户参加了竞赛。有些领导竞赛运动的干部，还有某种程度的官僚主义和形式主义作风。有些干部满足于会议上的挑战应战，放松了深入的组织工作。有些干部没有把重点创造经验和进行一般指导很好地结合起来，使运动停留在少数先进村庄。有些干部只进行一般化的全面推动，没有掌握重点，取得经验，也不能形成真正的增产运动。今后必须抓紧检查评比这一重要环节，加强思想教育，交流经验，树立旗帜，逐步充实竞赛的具体内容，不断修订计划，使运动逐步发展深入。
    爱国增产竞赛运动开展以后，互助合作组织飞跃发展，随着产生了许多新问题。因此，各地在七月份以检查、评比互助合作运动，作为领导增产运动的中心内容。
    现在河北各地正在小麦评比的基础上，展开以“比互助”为中心并结合“比缴粮”“比积肥追肥”“比夏锄”“比除虫”的夏季竞赛。领导方面继续对农村干部和广大农民进行爱国主义教育和政策教育，并号召学习、推广生产技术和先进经验，进一步加强对竞赛运动的领导，使运动更趋深入和平衡。在七月下旬河北省人民政府召开的农业生产会议上，杨秀峰主席一再告诫大家：大轰大干的时期已经过去了，今后必须把工作深入一步，克服官僚主义、命令主义的错误和形式主义的偏向，放手深入发动和组织群众，才能使运动不停地前进。
