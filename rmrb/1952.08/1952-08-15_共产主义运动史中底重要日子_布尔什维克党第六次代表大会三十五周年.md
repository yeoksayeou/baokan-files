An Important Day in the History of the Communist Movement
—The 35th Anniversary of the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party
Soviet Union Yi. Baomeiluo Fu
Editor's Note: The Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party was one of the most decisive events for the Soviet Communist Party (Bolshevik) during the transition from the February Revolution to the October Revolution in 1917. The October Socialist Revolution, which has world-historical significance, was prepared based on the guidelines set by this congress. We are publishing this article to help readers learn from international revolutionary experience.

The working people of all countries lovingly celebrate great events in the history of the international workers' movement as milestones on the road to freedom, happiness, and a socialist life. The Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party, held thirty-five years ago in August 1917, was one such significant event. This congress was the party's last congress before the Great October Socialist Revolution, and it played a very important role in the preparation for the victory of the revolution.

The circumstances under which the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party was held were very complex. After the February bourgeois-democratic revolution in 1917 overthrew the Tsar, Russia formed two centers of power, resulting in a unique and intricate combination of two powers and two dictatorships: the Provisional Government, which implemented the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Deputies, which implemented the dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. The Soviets could have become the real power because they relied on the armed people. However, the petty-bourgeois parties that seized leadership of the Soviets—the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks—implemented a policy of betrayal, unwilling to fulfill the demands of the revolutionary people, and handed over power to the bourgeoisie.

Based on Lenin's famous April Theses, the Bolshevik Party fought to transition from the bourgeois-democratic revolution to a socialist revolution that would transfer power to the proletariat and poor peasants. The Bolsheviks conducted extensive work among the workers and soldiers, explaining to them that when power was in the hands of the bourgeois Provisional Government and the Soviets were controlled by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, the people would not get peace, land, or bread; explaining that in order to achieve complete victory for the revolution, it was necessary to end the situation of two powers and concentrate all power in the hands of the working people. The Provisional Government, following the will of the Russian and foreign bourgeoisie, implemented the criminal policy of continuing the imperialist war, placing the country in an even greater state of dependence and enslavement to Britain, the United States, and France, and adopted repressive measures against workers, peasants, and soldiers. The capitalists sought to extinguish the revolution, closing factories and manufacturing plants. Hunger began in Russia, and destruction increased. The policies of the Provisional Government led the country to ruin.

This criminal policy of the Provisional Government was met with increasingly resolute resistance from the working people. Due to the Bolsheviks' daily and continuous propaganda and agitation work, the working masses increasingly broke away from the influence of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks and became convinced of the counter-revolutionary nature of the Provisional Government. The demonstrations held in Petrograd on April 20-21 and June 18 clearly demonstrated the rising revolutionary spirit of the workers and soldiers and their increasing trust in the Bolshevik Party. However, whenever the bourgeois regime was in difficulty, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks betrayed the revolutionary cause and ensured the victory of the bourgeoisie. At that time, counter-revolutionary forces had already used the "socialists"—the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks—to carry out dark conspiracies. In July 1917, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, in alliance with the bourgeoisie and White Guard generals, used force to suppress the mass demonstrations of workers and soldiers demanding the transfer of power to the Soviets, the cessation of the imperialist war, and the implementation of an active peace policy. Immediately afterwards, the counter-revolutionary forces launched a campaign of repression against the Bolshevik Party: closing Bolshevik newspapers, arresting many important figures in the Bolshevik Party, and ordering the arrest of Lenin.

Under these circumstances, the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party was held in secret. Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik Party, was being hunted by the Provisional Government, and had to hide in a shed near Razliv station, unable to attend the congress. Comrade Stalin resolutely opposed the proposal of the traitors Kamenev, Rykov, and Trotsky, which called for Lenin to be subjected to the punishment of the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government's court. Stalin's action saved Lenin's precious life for the party, for the Russian people, and for all mankind. Obviously, the purpose the bourgeoisie wanted to achieve was only to have Lenin tried in court and physically destroy him. The congress protested against the persecution of the proletarian leader and sent a letter of condolence to Lenin.

The congress was held under the direct leadership of Comrade Stalin, in accordance with Lenin's instructions. Comrade Stalin made the main reports to the congress—a summary report of the work of the Central Committee and a report on the current political situation. Stalin's report was an outstanding example of creative Marxism. It gave a profound analysis of the new balance of power within Russia and pointed out the party's tactics under the new conditions.

Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Provisional Government, in which the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik traitors participated, had embarked on the path of open imperialism and counter-revolution. During the July days, the situation of two powers coexisting had come to an end, ending in favor of the bourgeoisie, and the Soviets led by the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks had become appendages of the Provisional Government. Furthermore, the period of peaceful development of the revolution had come to an end. If, before the July events, the Bolsheviks sought to win a majority in the Soviets through explanatory work and re-elections, to change the Soviets' policies, and to change the composition and policies of the government through the Soviets, then now power could only be seized by overthrowing the Provisional Government.

Comrade Stalin said at the Sixth Party Congress: "The overthrow of the dictatorship of the imperialist bourgeoisie—that is the current slogan that the party should have now. The peaceful period of the revolution has ended. The period of battles and outbreaks has arrived" (Stalin's Complete Works, Vol. 3, p. 177). At the same time, Comrade Stalin argued that only by carrying out a socialist revolution could Russia be saved from the disasters inflicted upon it by the Constitutional Democrats, Socialist-Revolutionaries, and Mensheviks. These anti-people parties did not value Russia's national sovereignty, and continued to make Russia play the role of a provider of cannon fodder for the imperialist war, just as bourgeois governments and right-wing socialists in countries of the Atlantic bloc are now striving to turn their countries into providers of cannon fodder for the world domination ambitions of American expansionists. In his speech at the Sixth Party Congress and in many writings in 1917, Comrade Stalin exposed the American imperialists as destroyers of the freedom of all peoples, as the most vicious reactionaries and enemies of all peoples. In his essay "American Billions," Stalin wrote, "While the Russian revolution is gathering strength to defend its fruits, imperialism is striving to destroy it—American capital is supplying Kerensky, Milyukov, and Tsereteli with billions of dollars in alliance, in order to completely suppress the Russian revolution, thereby destroying the revolutionary movement that is increasingly expanding in Western Europe" (Stalin's Complete Works, Vol. 3, pp. 234-235).

Comrade Stalin, who led the work of the Sixth Party Congress, resolutely implemented the policy of socialist revolution in Russia and gave a fatal blow to all those who opposed this policy. Comrade Stalin exposed the Menshevik position of Bukharin, who had tried to prove that a socialist revolution was impossible, saying that the peasants were completely a counter-revolutionary mass and would not support the proletariat. Stalin pointed out in his speech that there were different kinds of peasants: rich peasants supported the imperialist bourgeoisie, while poor peasants sought to unite with the proletariat.

In the struggle against the Trotskyites' advocacy of waiting for a revolution of the proletariat in Western Europe before a socialist revolution could be carried out in Russia, Comrade Stalin defended and developed Lenin's doctrine of socialist revolution and Lenin's thesis on the vanguard role of the Russian working class. He pointed out that the best conditions had been created in Russia in 1917 for overthrowing imperialism. Comrade Stalin said: "If the socialist revolution in Russia is required to 'wait' until Western Europe 'begins,' that is despicable pedantry. This 'beginning' is in the country where it is most possible..." (Stalin's Complete Works, Vol. 3, p. 174). Comrade Stalin put forward the most important proposal. He said that it was Russia that would become the country that opened the path to socialism. "We must abandon the outdated notion that only Europe can show us the way. There is dogmatic Marxism, and there is creative Marxism. I am in favor of the latter kind of Marxism" (Stalin's Complete Works, Vol. 3, p. 187).

The resolutions of the Sixth Party Congress were a complete victory for creative Marxism. The congress united around Stalin, who adhered to Lenin's doctrine that socialism could be victorious in Russia. It became a congress for preparing an armed uprising, overthrowing capitalism, and fighting for the dictatorship of the proletariat. It approved the Bolsheviks' economic program, the basic points of which were: confiscation of landlords' land, nationalization of all land, banks, and large industries, and implementation of workers' control over production and distribution of products. In all its resolutions, the Sixth Party Congress particularly emphasized Lenin's principle that the alliance of the proletariat and the poor peasants was a condition for the victory of the socialist revolution. The congress denounced the Menshevik theory of the so-called neutrality of trade unions, pointing out that trade unions must become proletarian combat class organizations that always recognize the political leadership of the Bolshevik Party.

The congress adopted a new Party Constitution. The Party Constitution pointed out that all organizations of the Party should be based on democratic centralism, which means: all leading bodies of the Party, from top to bottom, should be produced by elections; Party organs at all levels should report on their work to the corresponding Party organizations on a regular basis; Party discipline should be strictly observed, and the minority must submit to the majority; lower-level organs and all Party members must absolutely implement the decisions of higher-level organs.

The great significance of the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party lies in the fact that it directed the Party towards the goal of carrying out armed uprisings, towards the goal of realizing the socialist revolution. The Bolshevik Party used all its activities to prepare for the execution of the great task of the proletariat seizing state power and transforming capitalist society revolutionarily into socialist society.

Lenin and Stalin created and cultivated the Bolshevik Party, a new type of party, a party of social revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Party, armed with advanced revolutionary theory and the strategy and tactics of Lenin and Stalin, confidently led the masses to victory in complex domestic and international environments. The Party seized the working masses from the influence of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, won a majority in the Soviets, and united the working people to engage in a decisive battle for the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Bolshevik Party merged these various revolutionary movements, such as the general democratic movement for peace, the peasant democratic movement for seizing landlords' land, the national liberation movement of all oppressed nations for national equality, and the proletarian socialist movement for overthrowing the bourgeoisie and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, into a general revolutionary torrent. This determined the fate of capitalism in Russia: in October 1917, capitalism in Russia was overthrown.

The Great October Socialist Revolution was an event of world-historical significance. In its preparations for victory, the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party played an extremely important role. The October Revolution opened a new era—an era of the demise of capitalism and the victory of socialism. It created a lighthouse—the Soviet Union—that illuminates the path for the working people of all countries to a new and free life. It accelerated the progress of mankind.

The great cause of renewing the world on the basis of freedom and socialism has now achieved tremendous success. The foundation of this cause was laid in 1917 on one-sixth of the earth's land—Russia. Now, the new socialist world, with 800 million people creating a free and happy life, stands in opposition to the old capitalist world, which exploits and oppresses the working people.

The Soviet Union and the people's democracies, in contrast to the capitalist countries, are implementing a policy of peace, making the utmost efforts to ease international tensions and establish friendly cooperation among all peoples. The working people of all countries recognize that the Soviet Union is a strong fortress of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    共产主义运动史中底重要日子
    ——布尔什维克党第六次代表大会三十五周年
    苏联  依·鲍梅洛夫
    编者按：布尔什维克党第六次代表大会是苏联共产党（布）在一九一七年由二月革命过渡到十月革命时期中最有决定意义的事件之一。具有世界历史意义的十月社会主义革命，便是依据这次代表大会所规定的方针来进行准备的。我们为了帮助读者学习国际革命经验特地发表这篇文章。
    世界各国的劳动人民热爱地庆祝作为走向通往自由、幸福与社会主义生活道路的路标底国际工人运动史中的大事件。在三十五年前，一九一七年八月间所召开的布尔什维克党第六次代表大会就是这种意义重大的事件之一。这次代表大会曾是在伟大十月社会主义革命前的党的最后一次代表大会，它在革命胜利的准备中是起了非常重大的作用。
    举行布尔什维克党第六次代表大会时的情况，是非常复杂的。一九一七年二月的资产阶级民主革命，推翻了沙皇以后，俄国形成了两个政权，结果是两个政权、两个专政特殊错综结合的局面：一个是实现着资产阶级专政的临时政府，另一个是实现着无产阶级和农民专政的工农兵代表苏维埃。本来苏维埃是能够成为真正的政权，因为它是倚靠于武装起来的人民。可是抓得了苏维埃领导权的小资产阶级政党——社会革命党人和孟什维克实行了叛卖政策，他们不愿履行革命人民的要求，而把政权拱手交给了资产阶级。
    布尔什维克党在有名的列宁四月提纲的基础上，为从资产阶级民主革命过渡到应当使政权转归无产阶级和贫苦农民掌握的社会主义革命而进行了斗争。布尔什维克们在工人和兵士群众间进行了巨大工作，向他们说明，当政权操在资产阶级临时政府手中，而苏维埃由孟什维克和社会革命党人操纵的时候，则人民便得不到和平、得不到土地、得不到面包；说明为了要获得革命完全胜利，就必须结束两个政权的局面，把全部政权集中在劳动人民手里。临时政府遵奉着俄国和外国资产阶级的意旨，执行了继续帝国主义战争的犯罪政策，使国家更甚地处在依赖英国、美国、法国的奴役地位，对工人、农民和兵士采取了镇压手段。资本家们力谋扑灭革命，关闭了工厂和制造厂。俄国开始了饥饿，破坏增长了。临时政府的政策把国家导向了破灭。
    临时政府这种犯罪政策遭到劳动人民方面日益坚决的回击。由于布尔什维克们每日不断的宣传鼓动工作，劳动群众日益摆脱了社会革命党人和孟什维克的影响而相信了临时政府底反革命性质。在四月二十日、二十一日和六月十八日于彼得堡举行了示威，这几次示威明显地表明了工人和兵士群众底革命精神日益高涨，表明了他们对布尔什维克党的信任日益提高。可是每当给资产阶级政权造成困难状态时，社会革命党人和孟什维克却背叛了革命事业而保障了资产阶级的胜利。在那时，反革命势力就已经利用“社会主义者”——社会革命党人和孟什维克干出了黑暗勾当。孟什维克和社会革命党人联合资产阶级及白卫将军，在一九一七年七月，用武力镇压了要求把政权转归苏维埃、停止帝国主义战争和实行积极的和平政策的工人和兵士的群众示威。紧接着反革命势力就来对布尔什维克党横施压迫：封闭布尔什维克报纸，捕逮了布尔什维克党中许多重要人物，并下令逮捕列宁。
    在这种情况下，布尔什维克党第六次代表大会是秘密举行的。布尔什维克党领袖列宁被临时政府探狗追寻，这时候不得不躲藏在拉兹里夫车站近旁一个草棚中，没能出席代表大会。斯大林同志当时坚决反对叛徒加米涅夫、李可夫和托洛茨基的提议，这个提议是叫列宁去受反革命临时政府法庭惩治。斯大林这一行动为党、为俄国人民、为全人类救全了列宁底宝贵生命。很显然，资产阶级所想达到的目的，只是使列宁到法庭受审而加以肉体上的摧残。代表大会对迫害无产阶级领袖提出抗议并致书慰问列宁。
    代表大会是在斯大林同志直接领导下，遵照列宁的指令举行的。斯大林同志做了代表大会主要问题的报告——中央委员会工作总结报告和论目前政治形势的报告。斯大林的报告是创造性的马克思主义的卓越典型。它给俄国内部力量的新对比以深刻地分析，并指出党在新条件下的策略。
    斯大林同志指出，社会革命党人和孟什维克叛徒们参加的临时政府，已经开始走上了公开的帝国主义和反革命底道路。在七月的时日里，两个政权并存局面已告终结，终结的结果是有利于资产阶级，而社会革命党人和孟什维克所领导的苏维埃，却变成了临时政府底附属品。并且，革命和平发展的时期已告终结。如果说，在七月事变以前，布尔什维克们力求用解释工作和改选的方法来争得苏维埃中的多数，改变苏维埃底政策，通过苏维埃而去改变政府底成分和政策，那末，现在只有采用推翻临时政府的方法才可以夺取政权。
    斯大林同志在第六次党代表大会上说：“推翻帝国主义资产阶级的专政，这就是现在党应有的当前口号。革命底和平时期业已结束。搏战和爆发的时期已经到来”（斯大林全集第三卷第一七七页）。同时，斯大林同志论证了只有实行社会主义革命，才可以把俄国从立宪民主党人、社会革命党人和孟什维克的政党使其遭受的灾难中挽救出来。这些反人民的政党不重视俄国的民族主权，使俄国继续作为帝国主义战争的炮灰供给者的角色，这就像现在资产阶级政府和大西洋集团各国的右翼社会党人正力谋把自己国家变为美国野心家们统治世界的炮灰供给者一样。斯大林同志在第六次党代表大会的演说中和在一九一七年所写的许多著述中，曾揭露了美帝国主义者是各族人民自由的摧残者，是最凶恶的反动分子和各族人民的敌人。斯大林在“美国亿万金元”的论文中写道，“当俄国革命正鼓起力量来保卫自己果实的时候，而帝国主义却力谋来消灭它，——美国资本以亿万金元供给克伦斯基、米留可夫和策烈铁里的同盟，为的是把俄国革命完全抑制下来，从而破坏西欧日益扩大起来的革命运动”（斯大林全集第三卷第二三四——二三五页）。
    领导第六次党代表大会工作的斯大林同志，坚决地实行了在俄国内社会主义革命的方针，给予了所有那些反对这个方针的人们以致命的回击。斯大林同志揭露了曾试图证明社会主义革命不可能，说什么农民完全是反革命群众，不会赞助无产阶级的布哈林的孟什维克立场。斯大林在演说中指出，有各种不同的农民：富裕农民赞助帝国主义资产阶级，贫苦农民则力求同无产阶级联合。
    在反对等待西欧无产阶级革命发生时，才可以在俄国内实行社会主义革命的托洛茨基分子主张的斗争中，斯大林同志保卫了并发展了列宁的社会主义革命学说和列宁关于俄国工人阶级的先锋作用的论述，他指出了一九一七年俄国国内已为推翻帝国主义创造了最良好条件。斯大林同志说——“如果要求使俄国的社会主义革命，要‘等待’一直到西欧‘开始’时，那是可鄙的迂腐习气。这个‘开始’是在那种有最大可能性的国家……”（斯大林全集第三卷第一七四页）。斯大林同志提出了最重要的提议。他说，正是俄国才会成为开辟走向社会主义道路的国家。“必须抛弃认为只有欧洲才能给我们指示道路的陈腐观念。有教条式的马克思主义，也有创造性的马克思主义。我是主张后一种马克思主义的”（斯大林全集第三卷第一八七页）。
    第六次党代表大会的决议是创造性马克思主义底完全胜利。代表大会团结在坚持列宁关于社会主义可能在俄国内胜利的学说的斯大林的周围。它成了准备武装起义，推翻资本主义，争取无产阶级专政的代表大会。它批准了布尔什维克底经济纲领，这个纲领底基本要点是：没收地主土地，把全国所有一切土地、银行及大工业收归国有，由工人实行监督生产和产品分配。第六次党代表大会在其所有一切决议中，特别着重强调了列宁认定无产阶级和贫苦农民联盟是社会主义革命胜利条件的原理。代表大会指斥了孟什维克的所谓工会的中立性的理论，代表大会指出，工会必须成为始终承认布尔什维克党政治领导的无产阶级战斗阶级组织。
    代表大会通过新的党章。在党章上指出，全党所有一切组织都应以民主集中制为基础，这就是说：全党上下所有一切领导机关都应按选举制产生；各级党机关应定期向各该党组织报告工作；严守党内纪律，少数必须服从多数；下级机关以及全体党员必须绝对执行上级机关底决议。
    第六次布尔什维克党代表大会的伟大意义就在于它把党指向于实行武装起义的目标，指向于实现社会主义革命的目标。布尔什维克党把自己的全部活动都用以准备执行由无产阶级夺取国家政权和把资本主义社会革命地改造为社会主义社会的伟大任务。
    列宁、斯大林创建了并培养了布尔什维克党这个新型的政党、社会革命和无产阶级专政的政党。由先进的革命学说和列宁、斯大林的战略与策略所武装的党，在国内和国际的复杂环境下，满怀信心地引导群众走向胜利。党把劳动群众从孟什维克和社会革命党人的影响下夺取过来，争得了苏维埃中的多数，团结了劳动人民为无产阶级专政进行决战。布尔什维克党把这些各种不同的革命运动，如为争取和平的一般民主运动，为夺取地主土地的农民民主运动，为争取民族平等的各被压迫民族的民族解放运动以及为推翻资产阶级和建立无产阶级专政的无产阶级社会主义运动汇合成为一支总的革命洪流。这决定了资本主义在俄国的命运：在一九一七年十月俄国资本主义被打倒了。
    伟大十月社会主义革命是具有世界历史意义的大事件。在其胜利的准备中，第六次布尔什维克党代表大会曾起了极其重大的作用。十月革命开辟了新纪元——是资本主义破灭与社会主义胜利的纪元。它创造了照亮世界各国劳动人民走向新的自由生活道路的灯塔——苏联。它加速了人类的进步。
    在自由和社会主义基础上革新世界的伟大事业，到现在已达到了巨大成就。这一事业的基础是一九
    一七年在地球上六分之一的土地——俄国开始奠定的。现在，拥有八亿人民在创建着自由幸福生活的社会主义新世界正和剥削压迫劳动人民的资本主义旧世界对立着。
    苏联和各人民民主国家，恰与各资本主义国家相反，它们正在实行着和平政策，竭尽至大的努力来缓和国际的紧张局面和确立着各族人民间的友好合作。世界各国劳动人民都认定苏联就是和平、民主与社会主义底坚强堡垒。
