Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th (TASS): A commentary by the *Pravda* reporter, Koren, on the abuses of Americans in Japan states: It is well known that even before World War II, Japanese financial and industrial giants were colluding with US monopoly capital. However, the current situation of US monopoly capital in Japan is fundamentally different from the past. The task of US monopolists is no longer limited to acting as partners of Japanese monopolists. While restoring the Japanese aggression force, the US financial and industrial giants have gained a dominant position in the countries they enslave, and they have completely controlled Japan's industry, raw material resources, finance, and trade.

Since Japan implemented the law encouraging foreign investment in June 1951, American businessmen have been buying large quantities of shares in important Japanese companies. Before this, foreigners had purchased a total of 215 million yen in Japanese stocks. In the first three months of this year, they purchased 576.4 million yen worth of stocks.

Foreigners often buy 50% to 100% of the stock of some Japanese companies, effectively becoming the bosses of these companies.

Koren said: According to newspaper reports, more than 30 Japanese companies are now completely controlled by foreign businessmen—mainly American businessmen.

American businessmen have the privilege of not paying tariffs and other taxes. Recently, at the request of the occupiers, thirteen more American companies that have opened branches in Japan have been granted this privilege. This means that the United States has more opportunities to plunder Japanese wealth and exploit the Japanese people. According to estimates by *Yomiuri Shimbun*, foreigners—mostly Americans—have already obtained 100 billion yen. *Yomiuri Shimbun* said that this money is currently being used illegally for new speculative businesses.

For two years, the United States has placed so-called "special procurement" orders in Japan totaling more than 644 million US dollars. These war orders are now increasing. Orders in June have doubled compared to May. The American bosses of Japanese enterprises are making a fortune by taking advantage of cheap raw materials and cheap labor. In the first three months of this year alone, Japan paid more than 1.5 million US dollars in bonuses and loan interest under contracts signed with foreign companies.

Although the war factories have made a fortune, many factories that have lost subsidies and cheap raw materials are closing down one after another, and hundreds of thousands of workers have lost their jobs. In the past four months, 1,470 small and medium-sized factories have closed down.

While destroying Japan's peaceful industry and impoverishing millions of Japanese workers, the American occupiers, under their control, have revived the Japanese monopolists—the zaibatsu.

According to newspaper reports, more than 150 of the largest Japanese factories are operating for the US military engaged in the war of aggression in Korea. *Jiji Shimpo* said that many Japanese companies have received new and huge orders for the manufacture of artillery, napalm bombs, machine guns, and rifles.

Koren said: This is how the American occupiers, with the help of Japanese financial giants, are using the Japanese economy for aggression and turning Japan into an American arsenal in the Far East.

    美国垄断资本控制日本经济
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：真理报记者科仁著文评论美国人在日本的虐政说：大家都知道，甚至在第二次世界大战以前，日本金融与工业巨头就与美国的垄断资本有勾结。然而美国垄断资本目前在日本的情况和过去比较，有了本质上的不同。目前美国垄断资本家的任务，已经不再限于充当日本垄断资本家的伙友。美国的金融与工业巨头一方面恢复了日本的侵略势力，一方面在他们所奴役的国家里取得了统治的地位，他们已经完全控制了日本的工业、原料资源、金融与贸易。
    自从一九五一年六月日本实行了鼓励外国投资的法律以后，美国商人特别大批购买日本重要公司的股票。在此以前，外国人在日本购买的股票共达二亿一千五百万日圆，在今年的头三个月中，他们购买的股票共达五亿七千六百四十万日圆。
    外国人常常把若干日本公司的股票购买去百分之五十到百分之一百，实际上成了这些公司的老板。
    科仁说：据报纸消息，目前已有三十多家日本公司完全被外国商人——主要是美国商人——所控制。
    美国商人有不纳关税与其他赋税的特权。最近根据占领者的要求，又有十三家在日本开设分公司的美国公司得到这种特权。这就是说美国有了更多的机会来掠夺日本财富和剥削日本人民。据“读卖新闻”估计，外国人——大部分是美国人——已经得到一千亿日圆。“读卖新闻”说，这一批钱目前正以非法的方式从事新的投机生意。
    两年以来，美国已在日本订了六亿四千四百万美元以上的所谓“特需”定货。这种战争定货现在越来越多。六月间的定货已比五月间增加了一倍。日本企业的美国老板们，利用廉价的原料和廉价的劳动力大发其财。仅在今年的头三个月中，日本根据与外国公司所订的合同而支付的红利与贷款利息，就达一百五十多万美元。
    虽然战争工厂发了大财，但是许多失去补助金与低廉原料的工厂，都在纷纷关门，几十万工人失了业。在最近四个月中间，已有一千四百七十个中小工厂关了门。
    美国占领者一方面破坏了日本的和平工业并使几百万日本工人陷于贫困，一方面却在他们的控制下复活了日本垄断资本家——财阀。
    据报纸消息说，有一百五十多家最大的日本工厂，都是为了在朝鲜进行侵略战争的美国军队而开工。“时事新报”说，许多日本公司已经接到制造大炮、凝固汽油弹、机枪与步枪的新的庞大的订单。
    科仁说：美国占领者就是这样依靠日本金融巨头的帮助，使日本的经济作为侵略之用，把日本变为美国在远东的兵工厂。
