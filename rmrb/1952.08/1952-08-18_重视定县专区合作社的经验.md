    Value the Experience of Cooperative Societies in the Dingxian Special District
    After the cooperative societies in the Dingxian Special District of Hebei Province improved their business management methods, implemented step-by-step cost disclosure, and reasonably assessed commodity prices, they overcame the past problem of unreasonable commodity prices, strengthened the relationship between upper-level and lower-level cooperatives, and won the support of the vast number of members. In a short period of time, the business and organization of cooperative societies at all levels have developed rapidly and significantly. This important reform in business by the cooperative societies in the Dingxian Special District is worthy of attention.
    In the past two years, cooperative societies in various regions have worked hard and achieved results in implementing the policy of serving members and serving production. However, there are still some shortcomings in their work, the most important of which is the purely profit-seeking viewpoint in the business management of many cooperative societies. In order to haggle over profits, upper-level cooperatives and lower-level cooperatives, or cooperatives between themselves, conceal costs from each other and proceed from their own positions. The upper levels do not rely on the lower levels, and the lower levels do not rely on the upper levels. They are willing to operate on things that are profitable or highly profitable. Even if plans and contracts have been signed for things that are unprofitable or have small profits, they are often unable to implement them conscientiously, causing adverse consequences in the operation of the cooperative societies and hindering the development of the cooperative cause. This phenomenon should have been changed long ago.
    The method of open cost and reasonable pricing adopted by the cooperative societies in the Dingxian Special District is a pioneering effort to change the above situation. This is a specific and effective measure to continue to prevent the purely profit-seeking viewpoint after criticizing the capitalist business thinking of cadres in the "Three-Anti" movement, and to implement the policy of "upper-level cooperatives serve lower-level cooperatives, and grassroots cooperatives serve members" from the bottom up. It will promote the sound development of the cooperative society's democratic system. Cooperative societies in various regions should experiment with this and promote it.
    However, it should be pointed out that after the cost is made public, when setting the selling price, the reasonable profits of the cooperative societies at all levels stipulated by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives must be implemented to prevent excessively low selling prices and the emergence of extreme democracy. To carry out this work, the upper-level cooperative societies must lead, plan, and organize it, and then promote it level by level according to the commodity circulation links. Leading comrades of cooperative societies at all levels should avoid taking a laissez-faire attitude towards this work. Otherwise, something that is originally a good thing may produce very bad results.
    
    Earnestly Fulfill Contracts and Maintain the Seriousness of Contracts
    Recently, material exchange meetings have been held in various parts of the country to invigorate the market and develop the urban and rural economy. Judging from some of the larger-scale material exchange meetings at the upper levels, most of the transactions at the meetings, except for a small part of cash and spot transactions, are concluded in the form of futures contracts, consignment contracts, etc. Therefore, whether the contracts can be implemented directly affects whether the achievements of these conferences can be consolidated and developed, the planned nature of social and economic development, and the production and life of the broad masses of the people.
    However, according to the inspection of past contracts in various places, some places have failed to comply with the provisions of the contracts, and even arbitrarily torn up the contracts. The destruction of contracts by the Pingyuan Province and the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federations in Shanxi is an example. This kind of illegal and undisciplined phenomenon must not be allowed to continue to exist. It is absolutely necessary for the Trade Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee and the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation to punish the Pingyuan Province and the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federations in Shanxi for destroying the contracts.
    What are the reasons why contracts cannot be implemented?
    First, both parties to the contract lack understanding of the production and sales of the goods they are dealing in, and cannot grasp the laws of market development. They blindly enter into contracts, which makes it difficult to fulfill the contracts and hinders their implementation. For example, when the Pingyuan Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation signed a contract for native cloth with the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federations, they did not understand the specifications of the local native cloth in advance, and did not supervise and inspect it afterwards. Therefore, the native cloth collected did not meet the quality stipulated in the contract. They also failed to foresee the changes in the price of native cloth, and did not make timely adjustments based on the actual situation afterwards. When the price of cloth changed, they delayed receiving and delivering the goods, and even violated the contract.
    Second, the purely profit-seeking viewpoint among some cadres in our state-owned trading enterprises and cooperative societies seriously hinders the implementation of the contracts they have signed. The responsible cadres of the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federations in Shanxi forgot that the cooperative society is to serve the members and serve production, and excessively haggled over the size of profits: If the profit is large, they are willing to do it and rush to do it; if there is no profit or the profit is small, they will not do it even if they have signed a contract.
    The above two situations are not only obstacles to the implementation of contracts, but also obstacles to the implementation of all business plans of state-owned trading enterprises and cooperative societies. Therefore, they must be resolutely overcome. We must continue to strengthen the investigation and research on the production and sales of commodities, and further eliminate the purely profit-seeking viewpoint among cadres of state-owned trading enterprises and cooperative societies, in order to ensure the implementation of contracts and the smooth completion of all business plans.

### 重视定县专区合作社的经验

    重视定县专区合作社的经验
    河北省定县专区合作社改进业务经营方法，实行逐级公开成本，并合理地评定商品价格以后，克服了过去商品价格不合理的现象，密切了上级社和下级社的关系，得到了广大社员的拥护，在短时期内，各级合作社的业务和组织都有了迅速的、显著的发展。定县专区合作社的这项业务上的重要改革是值得重视的。
    最近两年来，各地合作社在贯彻为社员服务、为生产服务的方针上是努力的，是有成绩的。但工作中也还存在着一些缺点，其中最主要的，就是不少合作社在业务经营上的单纯营利观点。上级社与下级社、或社与社之间为了计较利润，互相隐瞒成本，各从本位出发，上不依下，下不靠上，对有利或利大的愿意经营，无利或利小的即使订了计划、合同，也往往不能认真执行，引起合作社经营上的不良后果，妨碍了合作事业的发展，这种现象早就应该有所改变。
    定县专区合作社所采取的公开成本、合理确定价格的办法，就是改变以上情况的一项创举。这是“三反”运动中批判了干部中的资本主义经营思想之后，继续防止单纯营利观点，自下而上贯彻“上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务”方针的具体有效的措施。它将推动合作社民主制度的健全发展。各地合作社都应当对此进行试验并加以推广。
    但是应当指出，在公开成本之后，在规定出售价格时，必须贯彻合作总社所规定的各级社的合理利润，防止过低压低售价，以及极端民主现象的产生。进行这一工作，必须上级社有领导、有计划、有组织地做起，然后根据商品的流转环节逐级向下推行。各级合作社的领导同志，应切忌对这项工作采取放任自流的态度，否则，本来是一桩好事，也同样可能作出很坏的结果。
    切实履行合同，保持合同的严肃性
    全国各地在最近期间纷纷召开了物资交流会，以活跃市场，发展城乡经济。从一些上层的较大规模的物资交流会来看，会上除一小部分交易是现钱现货的成交外，绝大部分是以期货合同、代销合同等方式成交的。因此，合同的能否贯彻执行，就直接关系着这些大会的成绩能否巩固与发展，关系着社会经济发展的计划性，关系着广大人民的生产和生活。
    但是，根据各地检查过去合同的情况，有些地方发生过不遵守合同规定、甚至随便撕毁合同的事情。平原省及山西长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社的破坏合同就是一个例子。这种违法乱纪的现象，是绝不能容许继续存在的。华北行政委员会贸易局、华北供销合作总社给予破坏合同的平原省、山西长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社以处分，是完全必要的。
    合同不能贯彻执行的原因是什么呢？
    第一、签订合同的双方，对所经营商品的产销情况缺乏了解，对市场发展规律不能掌握，盲目订立合同，以致履行合同时发生困难，障碍了合同的贯彻执行。例如平原省供销合作总社在和长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社签订土布合同时，事先对当地所产土布的规格既很不了解，事后也没督促检查，因之所收土布不合合同规定的质量。他们也未预见到土布价格的变化，事后也不根据实际情况及时加以调整，而遇到布价有变时，就拖延收货、交货，以至违犯合同。
    第二、在我们国营贸易企业及合作社的某些干部中的单纯营利观点，严重障碍着对其所订合同的贯彻执行。山西长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社的负责干部，忘记了合作社是为社员服务、为生产服务这条方针，而过分地在那里计较营利大小：营利大，就愿意干，抢着干；无利或利小，就是已经订了合同，也不干。
    以上两种情况，不仅是贯彻执行合同的障碍，同时也是国营贸易企业及合作社实现全部经营计划的障碍，因此必须坚决克服它；必须继续加强商品产销情况的调查研究，进一步肃清国营贸易企业及合作社干部中的单纯营利观点，才能保证合同的贯彻执行，以及全部经营计划的顺利完成。
