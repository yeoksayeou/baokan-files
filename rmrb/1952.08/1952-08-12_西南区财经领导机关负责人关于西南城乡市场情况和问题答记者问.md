Responsible person of the Southwest District Financial and Economic Leading Organ answers Xinhua News Agency reporter's questions on the new situation and problems in the Southwest urban and rural market recently as follows:

Reporter: What is the current situation of the urban and rural market in the Southwest?

Answer: The market is quite active, and the transaction volume is constantly rising. The transaction volume of major commodities in eight major cities, including Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and Guiyang, increased by more than 10% in June compared with May, and 90% compared with the same period last year; July increased even further, and the transactions of some industries approached and exceeded the level of December last year. Judging from bank loans, the bank loans to private merchants in the Southwest region in June and July this year are more than four times that of the same period last year. Other items such as industrial and commercial remittances and freight have also increased, the number of urban industrial and commercial households has increased, and the number of employees has also increased. The purchasing power of rural areas has expanded even more than last year. Even in quite remote areas and remote counties, markets have now been established, and a new atmosphere of economic prosperity is everywhere. Recently, industrial products promoted by public and private commercial organizations in various parts of the Southwest have been quickly snapped up by farmers. Recently, various places in the Southwest are holding material exchange conferences, which will undoubtedly further prosper industry and commerce. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the leading role of the state-owned economy over private merchants has been strengthened. Therefore, the market is active, but not chaotic, and the possibility of speculation by merchants has been greatly reduced. This is the victorious result of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and this victory must be consolidated.

Q: Is this prosperous scene a seasonal phenomenon, or the beginning of a long-term prosperity?

A: According to past practices, the current time is not the peak trading season. Farmers are the main customers of the market. They usually have a large amount of currency to put into the market after the autumn harvest. Therefore, the current market activity is a prosperous scene in the "off-season." This is an inevitable result of the great liberation of the people, especially the land reform in rural areas. The Southwest region experienced a situation of "not weak in the off-season, and even stronger in the peak season" last year. The situation this year will definitely be better because: First, 80% of the region has completed land reform; Second, urban and rural areas are enthusiastically carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement, and industrial and agricultural production are developing greatly. This year's agricultural harvest is not bad, and both commodities and purchasing power have increased; Third, the state's investment in industry is even greater; Fourth, the living standards of the People's Liberation Army troops, employees in state-owned and public industries, and government staff have improved; Fifth, prices are stable; Sixth, China's foreign trade has further developed, and many local products in the Southwest can be exported; Seventh, after the "Three-Anti" movement, the state financial and economic staff cleared away the "three evils," and after the "Five-Anti" movement, private industrialists and businessmen greatly reduced the "five poisons," which provided very favorable conditions for the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, it can be asserted that the current trend of market activity will continue to develop, which is the beginning of the country's economic prosperity.

In order to illustrate that the increase in people's purchasing power is the source of economic prosperity, we can introduce such a material: Yingxi Township, Thirteen Village, Shifang County, a tobacco-producing area in western Sichuan, has only 937 people, but according to a reliable survey, after the autumn harvest this year, the average surplus purchasing power of each person in this village is 400,000 yuan, and the entire village has nearly 400 million yuan of surplus purchasing power. This is such a gratifying phenomenon!

Q: Some commercial capitalists believe that they will not have any positive role in the market. Is this correct?

A: As long as they are commercial capitalists who are engaged in businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and who no longer practice the "five poisons," they still have a positive role in the new democratic economic life. In fact, to this day, private merchants often account for 70% to 80% of the total transaction volume in the urban and rural markets of the Southwest region. This means that private commercial capital accounts for a large proportion. State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have developed and expanded in big cities, but at the same time the entire market has also greatly expanded. At present, state-owned trade only controls the wholesale of major commodities. As long as private commerce does not engage in speculative activities, they have broad prospects. Now, some private merchants have gone deep into remote areas and rural areas to promote industrial products and purchase local products, and have begun to change their old ways, which is very popular. Many areas in the Southwest are economically backward and need to carry out large-scale material exchanges; in order to meet the needs of the vast number of farmers, state-owned trade departments and private merchants still have many things to do. At present, farmers feel the lack of means of production the most. Agricultural tools, fertilizers, machines, and other means of production suitable for farmers are still not enough. In the future, we hope that industrialists and businessmen will make greater efforts in this regard.

Q: In order to further activate the market, what efforts are state-owned economy and cooperatives making?

A: State-owned trade departments and cooperatives are now carrying out industrial product promotion movements and vigorously launching local product purchase and sales movements and preparing for autumn purchases to further close the relationship between urban and rural areas. There are about thousands of types of local products in the Southwest, worth trillions of yuan, among which medicinal materials are the most famous. Some medicinal materials are produced in ethnic minority areas, and coupled with the inconvenient transportation in the Southwest, although there is no problem with the sales of local products, the purchase and concentration is still an arduous task. Promoting industrial products and purchasing local products are two aspects of carrying out material exchanges, and they still need to be done vigorously. Material exchange conferences are being held in various parts of the Southwest. Experience has proven that material exchange conferences are a good form of large-scale, centralized economic activity. They can carry out large-scale transactions, activate the market, and can also communicate production and sales information in various places and establish business contacts. Small-scale, small-scale (such as one county or one district) material exchange conferences play a great role in opening up the sales of small local products and promoting industrial products to the countryside. For example, a small-scale material exchange conference in Dazhou County, northern Sichuan, had a transaction volume of more than 20 billion yuan. In addition, in the upcoming large-scale national economic construction movement, transportation construction in the Southwest region will be an important part; the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will have an important impact on material exchanges within Sichuan.

Regarding the issue of uniting private industrialists and businessmen, the people's government has taken a series of measures, and recently reduced the tax on 30 kinds of local products. We believe that on the basis of the victory of the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, coupled with the correct leadership and active assistance of the state-owned economy, legitimate private industrialists and businessmen in the entire Southwest region will definitely operate actively and welcome the new situation.

Q: What ideological obstacles do you think should be overcome by financial and economic workers in further carrying out material exchanges and prospering the urban and rural economy?

A: The main ideological errors among financial and economic workers at present are as follows: First, the capitalist management thinking among some workers. They simply aim for profit, raise prices and suppress prices at will, do not buy when they should buy, do not sell when they should sell, and only pay attention to cities and suburbs close to cities, and do not pay attention to remote areas and ethnic minority areas, and do not solve the difficulties of the people there. These should be resolutely corrected. Second, some workers have a one-sided "mass viewpoint." Subjectively, they want the masses to benefit more, and blindly raise prices when purchasing local products and controlling regional price differences, so that the price of the place of origin is too high, making it difficult to sell, which is tantamount to cutting off the sales route. Prices should be fair and reasonable, so that the three aspects of production, transportation, and sales can all be profitable. Third, after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, a small number of financial and economic workers dare not associate with private industrialists and businessmen. This is abandoning leadership over private industrialists and businessmen and is a manifestation of right-leaning thinking. It is necessary to clearly recognize that legitimate private industrialists and businessmen have a certain positive role in the new democratic economic life, and we should take the initiative to unite them to strive for the development of production and the prosperity of the economy under the leadership of the state-owned economy. In the promotion of industrial products and the purchase of local products, private merchants should be organized to go to the countryside. Fourth, the various departments of financial and economic work do not cooperate well enough in their work. The work of activating the market is not only the responsibility of the trade system and cooperatives, but also the responsibility of banks, transportation, taxation, insurance, industry, and other departments. If these departments cannot cooperate closely, then the work will definitely not be done well.

    西南区财经领导机关负责人关于西南城乡市场情况和问题答记者问
    西南区财经领导机关负责人，关于最近西南区城乡市场呈现的新情况和问题，答新华社记者问如下：
    记者问：目前西南城乡市场情况怎样？
    答：市场相当活跃，交易额不断上升。重庆、成都、昆明、贵阳等八个主要城市的主要商品成交量，六月份较五月份增加百分之十以上，较去年同期增加百分之九十；七月份更向上增涨，一部分行业的交易接近并超过去年十二月的水平。从银行放款看，今年六、七两月西南全区银行对私商放款等于去年同期的四倍以上。其他如工商汇款、货运也都增加，城市工商业户增多，职工人数也增加。农村购买力比去年更加扩大，就是在相当偏僻的地区和边远县份，现在也建立了市场，到处呈现经济繁荣的新气象。最近各地公、私商业组织下乡推销的工业品，都很快被农民争购一空。最近西南区各地正在召开物资交流大会，无疑将使工商业更进一步繁荣起来。“三反”“五反”运动之后，国营经济对私商的领导作用加强了，因此市场活跃，但是不乱，投机商人的兴风作浪的可能大大减少了，这是“三反”“五反”运动的胜利成果，必须巩固这一胜利果实。
    问：这种繁荣的景象是季节性的现象呢，还是一种长期繁荣的开始呢？
    答：按过去常例目前不是交易旺季。农民是市场的主要顾客，他们通常是在秋收后才有大量货币投入市场，所以目前的市场活跃，是在“淡季”之中出现的旺季景象。这是人民大解放、特别是农村土地改革以后的必然结果。西南区去年就出现过“淡季不淡，旺季更旺”的情况，今年的情况一定更好，因为：第一、全区已有百分之八十的地区完成了土地改革；第二、城乡都热烈开展着增产节约运动，工农业生产都在大大发展中，今年的农业收成不坏，商品和购买力都增大了；第三、国家投放到工业的资金更大了；第四、人民解放军部队、国营和公营工业中的职工以及政府工作人员的生活待遇提高了；第五、物价是稳定的；第六、我国对外贸易已经进一步发展起来，西南许多土产可以外销；第七、国家财经工作人员“三反”后清除了“三害”，私营工商业者“五反”后大大减少了“五毒”，这对于工商业的发展提供了很有利的条件。因此，可以肯定地说，目前市场活跃的趋势将继续发展，这是国家经济繁荣的开始。
    为了说明人民购买力的增涨是经济繁荣的源泉，可以介绍这样一个材料：川西产烟区什邡县莹西乡十三村只有九百三十七人，但据确实调查，今年秋收后，这个村每人平均剩余购买力就有四十万元，全村就有近四亿元剩余购买力，这是多么可喜的现象！
    问：有的商业资本家认为他们在市场中不会有什么积极作用了，这是正确的吗？
    答：只要是经营对国计民生有益的业务的商业资本家，而又不再施“五毒”，他们在新民主主义的经济生活中还是有积极作用的。事实上，到今天为止，西南区城乡市场的交易总额中，私商经常占百分之七十到八十。这就是说，私营商业资本所占比重很大。大城市中国营商业和合作社商业是发展了，扩大了，但同时整个市场也大大扩大了。目前国营贸易也只是掌握了主要商品的批发，私营商业只要不作投机活动，他们就有广阔前途。现在有一部分私商深入边远地区和乡村推销工业品和收购土产，开始改变旧作风，就很受人欢迎。西南许多地区经济落后，需要大规模展开物资交流；为了满足广大农民群众的需要，国营贸易部门和私商还有许多事情要做。目前农民最感生产资料的缺乏，农具、肥料、机器等适合农民需要的生产资料都还不够，今后希望工商业者在这方面作更大的努力。
    问：为了进一步活跃市场，国营经济和合作社正在作何种努力？
    答：国营贸易部门和合作社现在正在进行工业品的推销运动和大力展开土产收购、推销运动和准备秋后的收购工作，使城乡关系进一步密切起来。西南土产品类约有数千种，价值数万亿，其中尤以药材最为著名。有些药材产于少数民族地区，加之西南交通不便，因此土产销路虽无问题，但是收购、集中还是一项艰巨的工作。推销工业品和收购土产是开展物资交流的两个方面，还需要大力去做。西南各地正在举行物资交流会。经验证明：物资交流会是大规模的、集中的经济活动的良好形式，它可以进行大批交易，活跃市场，而且是可以沟通各地产销情况，建立商业联系。小范围的、小型的（如一县、一区）物资交流会，对打开小宗土产的销路和推销工业品下乡有极大作用，如川北达县一个县的小型物资交流会上就成交了二百多亿元。此外，在即将到来的全国大规模经济建设运动中，西南区的交通建设将是重要的一环；成渝铁路的通车对四川境内的物资交流有着重要作用。
    关于团结私营工商业的问题，人民政府已采取了一系列措施，最近又减低了三十种土产的税收。我们相信在伟大的“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上，又加以国营经济的正确领导和积极帮助，全西南区正当的私营工商业者一定能积极经营，迎接新形势。
    问：你认为在进一步开展物资交流、繁荣城乡经济工作中，财经工作人员中还有那些思想障碍应该克服？
    答：目前财经工作人员中的主要思想错误有以下几种：第一种是一部分工作人员中的资本主义的经营思想，他们单纯为了赢利，随便提价、压价，当买不买、当卖不卖和只注意城市和城市近郊，不重视边远地区和少数民族地区，不解决那里人民的困难，这些都应坚决纠正。第二、一部分工作人员有片面的“群众观点”，主观上要使群众多得利，在收购土产和掌握地区差价时盲目提价，以致产地价格过高，难于推销，这无异于自绝销路。价格应求其公平合理，使产、运、销三方面都有利可图才行。第三是“三反”、“五反”运动之后，少数财经工作人员不敢和私营工商业者来往，这是对私营工商业放弃领导，是右倾思想的一种表现。要明确认识：正当私营工商业者在新民主主义经济生活中有一定的积极作用，我们应当主动团结他们在国营经济领导下为发展生产繁荣经济而努力。在推销工业品和收购土产中，更应组织私商下乡。第四是财经工作各部门在工作中配合得还不够好。活跃市场的工作，不仅是贸易系统和合作社的责任，也是银行、交通、税收、保险、工业等等部门的责任，如果这些部门不能密切配合，那么工作就一定搞不好。
