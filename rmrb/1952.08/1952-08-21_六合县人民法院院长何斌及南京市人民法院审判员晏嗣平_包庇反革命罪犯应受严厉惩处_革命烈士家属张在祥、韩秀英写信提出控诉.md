Editor's Note: The letters written by Zhang Zaixiang and Han Xiuying, family members of revolutionary martyrs, to the Subei Daily and Nanjing Xinhua Daily, fully expose the crimes of certain bad elements occupying important positions in the People's Courts who use their power to attack revolutionary people and shield counter-revolutionary elements stained with blood debts. These judicial personnel are not servants of the people at all, but enemies of the people! In the judicial reform movement, these bad elements must receive the punishment and handling they deserve in order to consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship.

Zhang Zaixiang's Letter to Subei Daily Editor:

I am very happy to hear that the People's Court is carrying out an ideological remolding movement. Now I want to accuse He Bin, the president of the Liuhe County People's Court, of shielding counter-revolutionaries. Subei Daily is the people's newspaper, and I ask you to support me.

I am from Ma'an Township, Maji District, Liuhe County. My father, Zhang Shou'an, was a Communist Party member. He worked as a village agricultural loan committee member as early as 1946. Because he worked actively, the local feudal bully Ren Xuechao hated him very much. In June of that year, when the county seat of Liuhe was just occupied by the Kuomintang bandit army, before the "Homecoming Corps" (reactionary landlord armed forces) had "returned home," Ren Xuechao ran to Liuhe City and asked the bandit township head Ge Xianghui to return to the village to arrest my father. Sure enough, ten days later, when Ge Xianghui returned to the village, he arrested my father. The torture my father suffered is indescribable. My father was a Communist Party member, and he did not yield in front of the enemy. One night, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, he seized a gun and wounded three bandit Bao chiefs (local security chiefs) who were guarding him, Chen Bingquan, Hu Jiahuai, and others, and escaped. Ren Xuechao, with his wicked intentions undiminished, immediately inquired about my father's whereabouts everywhere. The next day, my father was caught again. Ren Xuechao went to Liuhe City and discussed with Ge Xianghui. Then they tied my father to a telephone pole on Ma'an Mountain and exposed him to the hot sun for two days, and then shot him to death. After he was killed, my family was not allowed to collect the body. As a result, the corpse was dragged away and eaten by dogs, and not even a bone was recovered. Not only did they kill my father, but they also robbed my family of everything. My brother Zhang Zaigang was also arrested and detained for more than a hundred days, and I was also arrested and hung up for several days.

In the spring of 1950, at our request, the township government arrested Ren Xuechao and sent him to the district for legal action. However, He Bin, the president of the County People's Court, listened to Ren Xuechao's wife's one-sided account and criticized me instead, saying: "Arresting people for no reason is an infringement of human rights and a violation of the law." And summoned me to the county for interrogation. Fortunately, the district and township cadres provided me with proof many times, so I was not convicted. But He Bin only sentenced Ren Xuechao to six months in prison and released him four months early. I asked He Bin why he didn't severely punish Ren Xuechao, and he said: "Ren Xuechao was not a high-ranking Kuomintang official, so how can he be killed for killing your father? What can be done if he firmly denies it? Ge Xianghui must be brought to court for confrontation." Editor, Ge Xianghui had not been caught at that time, and I didn't know where he had fled to. How could I find Ge Xianghui to confront him? Isn't He Bin deliberately burying my grievances?

The great movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries has punished many counter-revolutionary criminals for our people. Ge Xianghui was arrested by the People's Public Security organs at this time. I went to the People's Court to file a complaint again. The district and township cadres also repeatedly requested that the murderer be punished. Only then did the Liuhe County People's Court summon Ren Xuechao and sentence him to fifteen years in prison and Ge Xianghui to death.

Editor, please don't think that He Bin's sentencing of Ren Xuechao to fifteen years in prison means that he has corrected his mistakes. From the second verdict, I can see that He Bin is not on the same side as us at all. He said that Ren Xuechao and my family had "old grudges," that is to say, there were many personal feuds. Killing my father was "taking revenge." It seems to say that my father had offended Ren Xuechao in the past, and Ren Xuechao's killing of my father did not involve political issues. Do you think He Bin still has the flavor of a people's judicial cadre? He can even describe this struggle between revolution and counter-revolution as a civil dispute. He also said: "Ren Xuechao's intention at the time was not to trap Zhang Shou'an to death..." Isn't this the same as talking nonsense with your eyes closed? Ren Xuechao participated fully in informing on and killing my father, and he was the chief instigator. How can he say that there was no intention to trap him to death? Does he have to kill my father with his own hands to be considered intentional? He Bin even shamelessly said to me: "If your father hadn't injured three people, he wouldn't have killed him." Editor, I was really angry at the time. According to He Bin's statement, it is wrong for our cadres to fight the enemy after being arrested! They are asking for death! They should close their eyes and wait for death or kneel down and beg for mercy! It is also reasonable for the enemy to kill our heroic cadres who fight bravely! No wonder He Bin is indifferent and doesn't care about our such a big blood feud. And as soon as the people arrested the murderer, he was shocked and restless. Who is this kind of person working for? Or is he helping the enemy?

I want to tell you that He Bin's shielding of counter-revolutionaries has a reason. He used to be a stubborn pseudo-element, had participated in Kuomintang secret service organizations, and had been a Chiang bandit regiment commander. Later, he was won over by us, but he defected again. Around 1944, he was won over again. In his work, he pretended to be progressive, but secretly shielded counter-revolutionary elements and local bullies. His crimes of corruption, turning right and wrong upside down are really too many. There have been more than twenty cases of shielding counter-revolutionary elements alone. I hope you will send people to investigate quickly.

Finally, I think He Bin is not worthy of being the president of our People's Court. He must be driven out of the People's Court. And I request the People's Government to punish him according to law.

Han Xiuying's Letter to Nanjing Xinhua Daily Editor:

I strongly support the learning movement against the old legal viewpoints and old judicial style that the People's Court is about to launch, as seen in the newspaper. From my personal experience, I feel that some judicial personnel have very strong old legal viewpoints and completely violate the will of the people when handling cases. Now I am here to expose the criminal behavior of Yan Siping, a judicial staff member of the Municipal People's Court, in handling counter-revolutionary cases.

In November 1949, I filed a complaint with the People's Court accusing the counter-revolutionary Li Songshan of murdering my husband, the Communist Party member Deng Dinghai. Li Songshan was the propaganda committee member of the Chiang bandit Xiaguan District Party Department. During his tenure, he instructed thirteen district branches to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. He was also the head of the Hongbang Gelaohui (secret society), with more than a thousand followers under him, rampaging and committing heinous crimes in the Xiaguan area. Since 1913, he had been a foreman at Jardine Matheson & Co. for a long time, relying on the power of British imperialism to oppress workers in every possible way. Later, he served as the detective captain of the pseudo-garrison headquarters, colluding with more than forty accomplices, infiltrating the workers, destroying trade union organizations, and suppressing the just actions of the workers by extremely cruel means. Seventeen Communist Party members and patriotic workers were arrested and sacrificed as a result of his frame-up. Among them, Ren Xietao, Song Ruhai, Zhao Zihua and other eight Communist Party members died at Yuhuatai, and my husband Deng Dinghai was also one of them. Deng Dinghai worked at Jardine Matheson & Co. in 1929. He led and united the workers and brothers to organize a trade union and waged an unyielding struggle against imperialism. In order to please his foreign masters, Li Songshan tried every means to frame him. On April 3, 1930, Jardine Matheson & Co. workers demanded a wage increase but failed, and all the workers held a general strike. Li Songshan colluded with more than a thousand followers, holding knives, iron rods and other weapons, forcing the workers to resume work. At that time, more than 20 workers were injured, and he threatened to beat Deng Dinghai to death and push him into the river. Deng Dinghai was forced to flee to Hankou. Later, Li Songshan colluded with his sworn brother Yu Xikun (the detective chief of the pseudo-garrison headquarters) to set up reconnaissance work in Shanghai and Hankou. Soon Deng Dinghai was arrested in Hankou and escorted to Nanjing. On January 19, 1931, my beloved husband, the outstanding Communist Party member Deng Dinghai, died under the enemy's butcher knife at Yuhuatai. Before his death, he wrote me a letter saying: "The revolution will surely achieve its goal. After the revolution succeeds, you avenge me. I did not die in vain. Don't be sad." When my family received this bad news, they cried to death. My father-in-law became a monk, and my mother-in-law hanged herself in grief. I was left with a one-month-old orphan, hiding in a temple and suffering all kinds of hardships. For twenty years, I have buried my hatred in my heart, hoping for liberation, hoping to settle the blood debts with the counter-revolutionary Li Songshan. Who knew that after liberation, when I filed a complaint with the People's Court against the blood-debt-ridden Li Songshan, Li Songshan was released under the protection of Judge Yan Siping. The facts are as follows:

In November 1949, I came to Nanjing from Jiangbei and asked my brother Han Xiangrong to write a petition to the Sixth Public Security Bureau accusing Li Songshan of his crimes. Soon, the Sixth Public Security Bureau arrested Li Songshan and handed him over to the court for handling. After arriving at the court, there was no response for a long time. We ran to ask several times, and finally the court opened a hearing. When Judge Yan Siping saw me, he said: "This matter has been going on for twenty years. It's been too long. Does Jardine Matheson & Co. still exist?" I showed him the Xinhua Daily of November 3, 1949, which contained the heroic struggle of Jardine Matheson & Co. employees before liberation and the news of the establishment of the Jardine Matheson & Co. trade union. After he read it, he didn't say anything and immediately questioned Li Songshan. During the questioning, he treated such a blood-debt-ridden counter-revolutionary with a kind and gentle attitude, without any hatred. Li Songshan tried every means to deny it, denying all the past crimes, describing himself as an "honest businessman," and saying that we were slandering him. The first court's interrogation was fruitless, and I felt really bad. After that, Yan Siping went down to investigate once, but he did not investigate among the masses in Xiaguan, but talked with Yu Yongfa, Li Songshan's sworn brother. During the second interrogation, Yan Siping said to me: "What you said is not right. Deng Dinghai was arrested in Hankou." I told him the details of Li Songshan's crimes again, and he said: "Find witnesses. You need more witnesses." I thought, isn't this deliberately making things difficult? Twenty years have passed. People have left, died, and how can I find so many witnesses? Moreover, everyone in the Xiaguan area knows about Li Songshan's crimes. As long as the court investigates seriously, it will be easy to find out. Later, we spent a lot of effort to find Xu Yunlu, a Jardine Matheson & Co. worker who participated in the strike in 1930, and Sun Qingshan, who witnessed Li Songshan's crimes, to testify. However, as soon as Judge Yan Siping saw these two witnesses, he said in a threatening tone: "Don't fabricate. If you talk nonsense, you will be sentenced to more than seven years in prison." The witnesses answered confidently: "Of course, we will testify if there are such facts." Seeing this situation, I narrated some of Li Songshan's crimes again. Yan Siping said impatiently: "Don't go on, I'll lock you up if you talk any more." Seeing his attitude and hearing these words, I was heartbroken and tears welled up like a spring. I am a martyr's family member. Is it illegal for me to accuse the counter-revolutionary who killed my husband? This case was interrogated six or seven times, and it was never clear who was right and who was wrong. Yan Siping treated us harshly, but treated the counter-revolutionary Li Songshan calmly, without any air of a people's judge. Although his body was sitting in the People's Court, his actions were serving the reactionary rulers. Once I went to ask him why the case was not being handled quickly, he asked me: "What private feud do you have with him? Are you slandering him?" I was so angry when I heard this that I cried, and he said barbarously: "Get out of here, don't cry here." What's the difference between this kind of behavior and the reactionary rulers? One day in January 1950, Judge Yan Siping suddenly called my brother Han Xiangrong and told my brother: "Li Songshan is old and now he is sick again. We can't handle it. We have released him. Go to the local area to find a mediator for your affairs and ask him for appropriate conditions." And he repeatedly urged: "The conditions you want can't be too high." What is this? Why is Yan Siping so considerate to a blood-debt-ridden counter-revolutionary who killed many Communist Party members and patriotic workers? I was extremely angry when I heard this news, but there was nothing I could do. It was not until the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries last year that Li Songshan received the punishment he deserved and was executed by shooting on June 17.

At present, the People's Court is carrying out reform work. I am exposing this matter for everyone to judge. I think Judge Yan Siping is completely unworthy of being a people's judge. If such people continue to hold judicial positions, the people's rights cannot be guaranteed.

    六合县人民法院院长何斌及南京市人民法院审判员晏嗣平
    包庇反革命罪犯应受严厉惩处
    革命烈士家属张在祥、韩秀英写信提出控诉
    编者按：革命烈士家属张在祥、韩秀英写给苏北日报和南京新华日报的信，充分地暴露出某些在人民法院中窃据要职的坏分子利用职权地位打击革命人民，包庇血债累累的反革命分子的罪行。这些司法人员完全不是人民的勤务员，而是人民的敌人！在司法改革运动中，这类坏分子必须得到应得的惩罚和处理，以巩固我们的人民民主专政。
    张在祥给苏北日报的信编辑同志：
    听说人民法院开展思想改造运动，我非常高兴。现在我要控诉六合县人民法院院长何斌包庇反革命的罪行。苏北日报是人民的报纸，要求你们给我撑腰。
    我是六合县马集区马鞍乡人。父亲张寿安是一个共产党员。一九四六年就做村农贷委员。因为他工作积极，本村封建恶霸任学潮非常仇恨他。那年六月，六合县城刚被国民党匪军占领，“还乡团”（反动地主武装）还没有“还乡”的时候，任学潮就跑到六合城去，要求匪乡长葛祥惠回乡逮捕我父亲。果然，十天后葛祥惠还乡时，就把我父亲抓去了。父亲所受的苦刑是一言难尽的。我的父亲是一个共产党员，他在敌人面前不屈服，夜里乘敌人不备，夺过枪来打伤看押他的匪保长陈秉全、胡家骅等三人，逃跑出来。任学潮贼心不死，立即到处打听我父亲的下落。第二天，我父亲又被捉回去。任学潮跑到六合城和葛祥惠商量好，便把我父亲绑在马鞍山的电话杆上，活活地给火热的太阳晒了两天，再用枪打死。打死以后，还不允许我家去收尸。结果，尸首给狗拖吃了，连一根骨头都没有收到。打死我父亲不算，他们又把我家抢得光光的。我的哥哥张在刚也被抓去关了一百多天，我也被抓去吊打了几天。
    一九五○年春天，经我们要求，乡政府把任学潮逮捕送区法办。可是，县人民法院院长何斌听信任学潮女人一面之词，反批评我说：“无故抓人，实属妨害人权，违犯法纪。”并把我传到县里审问。幸得区、乡干部多次给我证明，才没有办我的罪。但何斌只判任学潮六个月徒刑，又提早四个月释放。我问何斌为什么不重办任学潮，他说：“任学潮没当国民党大官，怎好杀你父亲呢？人家坚决不承认有什么办法？必须葛祥惠到堂对质才行。”编辑同志，葛祥惠在当时还没落网，也不知他跑到那里去了，怎能找葛祥惠来对质呢？何斌不是故意埋没我的冤仇吗？
    伟大的镇压反革命运动，给我们人民惩办了很多反革命罪犯。葛祥惠在这时被人民公安机关逮捕了。我又到人民法院告状。区、乡干部也多次要求惩办凶手。六合县人民法院才把任学潮传去，判处他十五年徒刑，判处葛祥惠死刑。
    编辑同志，你们千万不要认为何斌判处任学潮十五年徒刑就是改正错误了。从第二次的判决书上，我看出何斌根本就不是和我们站在一个立场上。他说任学潮和我家有“宿仇”，就是说，有很多的私仇。杀害我父亲是“挟嫌报复”。似乎说，我父亲过去得罪过任学潮，任学潮杀害我父亲并没有政治问题。你看何斌还有一点人民司法干部的味道吗？他竟能把这种革命与反革命的斗争说成民事纠纷。他并说过：“任学潮当时之意图，虽非将张寿安陷害致死……”这不就等于闭起眼睛说胡话吗？任学潮从告密直到杀死我的父亲，是全部参加的，而且是个主谋犯。怎能说没有陷害致死的意图呢？难道一定要亲手杀死我父亲，才算有意图的吗？何斌更无耻地对我说：“要不是你父亲打伤人家三个人，人家是不会杀他的。”编辑同志，当时我真要气死了。根据何斌的说法，我们的干部被捕后，和敌人斗争是错误的！是自己找死的！应该闭起眼睛等死或者是跪地求饶！敌人杀死我们英勇斗争的干部也是合情合理的！怪不得何斌对我们这样大的血仇，不关痛痒，毫不在乎。而人民刚逮捕了凶手，他就大惊大怒，坐卧不安。这样的人，究竟是为人民办事的呢？还是在帮助敌人呢？
    我要告诉你们，何斌包庇反革命是有来由的。他过去就是顽伪分子，早就参加过国民党特务组织，做过蒋匪团长。后被我们争取过来，又叛变了。一九四四年左右又被争取过来，在工作中假装进步，暗地却包庇反革命分子和地主恶霸。他的贪污腐化、颠倒是非的罪行真是太多了。单包庇反革命分子就有二十多次。希你们迅速派人来调查。
    最后，我认为，何斌是不配当我们人民法院的院长的。必须把他赶出人民法院的大门。并要求人民政府依法办他的罪。

    韩秀英给南京新华日报的信编辑同志：
    在报纸上看到人民法院要开展反对旧法观点及旧司法作风的学习运动，我非常拥护。我从亲身的体验中，感到某些司法人员由于存在着极浓厚的旧法观点，在处理案件时完全违背了人民的意志。现在我来揭发本市人民法院司法人员晏嗣平在处理反革命案件时的罪恶行为。
    一九四九年十一月，我曾向人民法院控告反革命分子李松山杀害我的丈夫、共产党员邓定海的事实。李松山是蒋匪下关区党部宣传委员，任职时，指使十三个区分部进行反革命活动。他又是红帮哥老会头子，在他手下的徒众有千余人，在下关一带横行霸道，罪恶滔天。自一九一三年起，即长期在和记洋行当工头，依仗英帝国主义势力，百般欺压工人。后来，他又担任伪卫戍司令部侦探队长，伙同四十多个爪牙，打入工人内部，破坏工会组织，并以极残酷的手段镇压工人的正义行动。经他陷害而被逮捕和牺牲的共产党员及爱国工人，有十七人。其中任爕涛、宋如海、赵子华等八个共产党员就义于雨花台，我的丈夫邓定海也是其中的一个。邓定海于一九二九年在和记洋行做工，他领导和团结着工人兄弟组织了工会，和帝国主义进行不屈不挠的斗争。李松山为着讨好他的外国主子，就百般设法陷害他。一九三○年四月三日和记洋行工人要求增加工资未成，全体工人举行大罢工，李松山即伙同徒众千余人，手持大刀、铁棍等凶器，迫使工人复工。当时打伤工人二十余人，并声言要把邓定海打死推下江去。邓定海被迫逃到汉口。以后李松山又伙同他的结拜兄弟余锡昆（伪卫戍司令部的侦探长）在上海、汉口布置侦察工作。不久邓定海就在汉口被捕，解到南京。一九三一年一月十九日，我亲爱的丈夫、优秀的共产党员邓定海便在敌人的屠刀下就义于雨花台。临就义时他写了一封信给我说：“革命一定会达到目的，革命成功后你给我报仇，我没有白死，你不要伤心。”家里人得到这一噩耗，哭得死去活来。我的公公出家当了和尚，婆婆悲愤上吊而死。剩下我和一个月的孤儿，藏身庙中，吃尽苦头。二十年来，我将仇恨埋在心里，盼望着解放，盼望着和反革命分子李松山清算血债。谁知解放后，我向人民法院控告血债累累的李松山时，李松山却在审判员晏嗣平的包庇下被释放了。事实经过是这样：
    一九四九年十一月，我由江北来南京，叫我的哥哥韩向荣写了一个状子给公安六分局，控告李松山的罪行。不久公安六分局即将李松山逮捕，转交法院处理。到了法院以后，好久未得回音。我们跑去问了好几次，好容易才开庭讯问。审判员晏嗣平见到我开头就说：“这事已经二十年了，时间太久，和记洋行是否还有呢？”我将一九四九年十一月三日的新华日报给他看，那上面登有和记洋行职工在解放前的英勇斗争事迹与和记洋行工会成立的消息。他看了后也不说什么，随即讯问李松山。讯问时，对待这样一个血债累累的反革命分子竟和颜悦色，毫无仇恨的表情。李松山则百般狡赖，对过去的罪行一概不承认，把自己说成是“老实商人”，说我们诬告他。第一庭的审问毫无结果，我心里感到真不是味道。这以后，晏嗣平曾下去调查过一次，可是他不在下关群众中去调查，却去和李松山的结拜兄弟俞永法交谈。第二次讯问时，晏嗣平对我说：“你说的不对头，邓定海是在汉口被捕的。”我又将李松山的罪行详细的说了一遍，他说：“你找证明人，证明人要多才行。”我心想，这不是故意为难吗？二十年了，人都走的走了，死的死了，那能找那么多证明人呢？而况李松山的罪行在下关一带是谁都知道的，只要法院认真地调查一下就好弄明白的。后来我们费了很大力气，找到在一九三○年参加罢工的和记洋行工人徐云路和亲眼看见李松山行凶的孙清山二人来作证。可是审判员晏嗣平一见到这两个证人，就用威胁的口气说：“你们不要捏造。如果胡说乱道，就要判七年以上的徒刑。”证人理直气壮地回答：“当然有这样的事实我们才来作证。”我看到这种情况，又把李松山的罪行叙述了一些。晏嗣平不耐烦地说：“你不要说下去了，再说把你关起来。”我看到他这样态度，听到这样的话，伤心透了，眼泪像泉水一样的涌出来。我是个烈属，我控告杀害我丈夫的反革命分子还犯法吗？此案一共讯问了六、七次，一直分不清是非。晏嗣平对待我们声色俱厉，对待反革命分子李松山却心平气和，简直就没有一点人民审判员的气味。他的身子虽然坐在人民法庭里，他的行动却是在为反动统治者服务。有一次我去问他案子为何不迅速处理时，他竟问我：“你和他有什么私仇？你诬告他吧？”我听到这话气得哭起来，他蛮横地说：“滚出去，不要在这里哭。”这种行为和反动统治者还有什么两样？一九五○年一月里有一天，审判员晏嗣平突然将我哥哥韩向荣叫了去，告诉我哥哥说：“李松山年纪大了，现在他又有病，我们无法处理，已经把他开释了，你们的事到地方上去找个和解人吧，你们向他要个适当条件。”并再三叮嘱说：“你们要的条件也不能太高。”这是什么话？对待杀害许多共产党员和爱国工人的血债累累的反革命分子，晏嗣平为什么这样体贴入微呢？我当时听到这样的消息，气愤极了，但没有任何办法。直到去年镇压反革命运动时，李松山才受到了应得的惩罚，于六月十七日执行枪决。
    目前，人民法院正进行改革工作，我把这件事揭露出来，让大家公断。我认为审判员晏嗣平完全不配做人民的审判员。让这样的人继续担任司法工作，人民的权利就无法得到保障。
