    Persist in Learning Advanced Experience
    Comrade Editor: I am a worker in the Third Production Team of the Chengzi Mine, Jingxi Mining Bureau. Our team has already started learning advanced drilling and blasting techniques such as the large-hole deep-hole blasting method. In the first two days of learning, our team drilled holes 1.7 meters deep, and the blasting depth was also 1.7 meters. After the blast, we went into the roadway and saw it was full of coal. Everyone was as happy as if it was the New Year. Then we asked to receive three-meter-long lead rods for deep-hole operations. The leading cadres attached great importance to our work in promoting advanced experience and immediately allocated three-meter-long lead rods to us. This time, we drilled the blast holes to a depth of 2.5 meters, and the empty holes to 3 meters. But it happened that we encountered hard coal this time, and we did not increase the amount of explosives, which resulted in failure. As a result, conservative ideas emerged. Some said, "If we continue to experiment like this, we will not be able to complete the task"; others were afraid of not earning the standard wage. We began to doubt the advanced experience of others.
    Our leading cadres kept a close watch on us. At this time, they told everyone that it didn't matter if we produced a little less coal during the experimental period. Furthermore, they helped us study and improve the position, number, and depth of the drilling, and appropriately increase the amount of explosives according to the depth of the blast holes and the hardness of the coal. After finding the reasons for the failure, we experimented again. This time, we drilled holes 2 meters deep, and the blasting depth was also 2 meters. At this time, our conservative ideas were all reversed. Now, we are continuing to experiment.
    Worker of Chengzi Mine, Jingxi Mining Bureau, Chen Genhua

    学习先进经验要坚持到底
    编辑同志：我是京西矿务局城子矿第三生产小组的工人，我们小组已经开始学习大眼深孔爆破法等先进的打眼放炮技术。我们小组开始学习的头两天，炮眼打了一公尺七，爆破的深度也是一公尺七。响炮以后，我们到巷道里一看满洞都是煤，大家好像过年一样的高兴。接着我们就要求领三公尺长的铅杆进行深眼作业，领导干部很重视我们推广先进经验的工作，马上给我们拨了三公尺长的铅杆。这次我们打炮眼一下打到二公尺五，空心眼则打到三公尺，可是碰巧这一次碰到了硬煤，我们装的炮药又没增加，结果遭到失败了。于是保守思想都来了。有的说：“这样试验下去就完不成任务了”；有人害怕挣不上标准工资。我们对人家的先进经验怀疑起来了。
    我们领导干部对我们抓的很紧。这时候，他们告诉大家说，试验期间少出一点煤也没有关系，并且，还帮助我们研究改进打眼的位置、数量和深度，根据炮眼的深度和煤的软硬，适当增加装药量等。找出了失败的原因后，我们又作试验，这一次，我们打了两公尺深的眼，爆破的深度也是两公尺。这时候，我们的保守思想就都扭过来了。现在，我们正在继续试验。
