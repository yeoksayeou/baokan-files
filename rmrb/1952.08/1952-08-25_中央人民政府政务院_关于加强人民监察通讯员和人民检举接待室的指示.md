The great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, due to the combination of leadership and the masses, the combination of top-down inspection and bottom-up reporting, extensively promoted democracy, gained the active support and participation of the broad masses, and achieved brilliant results. People's Supervision Correspondents and People's Complaint Reception Rooms played their due role in this movement. In order to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns and prevent the "three evils" in government organs and the "five poisons" in the business community from continuing to occur, it is necessary to promote the organization of People's Supervision Correspondents and People's Complaint Reception Rooms and strengthen their leadership, so as to closely link the broad masses and exert the supervisory role of the masses through this method. The following instructions are hereby given:

    I. Universally develop People's Supervision Correspondents. People's Supervision Committees of people's governments at the county (city) level and above (including People's Supervision Offices of Commissioner's Offices) should, based on the actual situation, develop People's Supervision Correspondents in government organs, enterprise departments, and people's organizations at all levels. The supervision organs in large, medium, and small cities and counties should also focus on developing People's Supervision Correspondents in their subordinate towns and villages. Supervision organs of various departments should develop People's Supervision Correspondents within their enterprise units. The method of development should be gradually developed by the People's Supervision Committees at all levels or the supervision organs of various departments in consultation with relevant organs and enterprise units. In order to strengthen the connection between People's Supervision Correspondents and the masses, the selection of People's Supervision Correspondents should be done through democratic methods, recommending activists in production and work during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and those who are fair, responsible, loyal, brave, and good at connecting with the masses, to be People's Supervision Correspondents, who shall be reviewed, appointed, and led by the People's Supervision Committees at all levels or the supervision organs of departments. If there are more than three People's Supervision Correspondents in the same organ or region, a group should be formed, and a group leader should be elected to be responsible for contacting the supervisory committee or department supervision agency to which they belong, in order to convey instructions, study problems, exchange experiences, and improve work.

    The task of the People's Supervision Correspondents is to investigate all illegal and disciplinary violations, such as corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and passive怠工 of government organs, enterprise departments, and their staff, which damage the interests of the state or the people; and to solicit the masses' opinions on government policies, laws, and regulations, report to the higher-level supervision organs and the heads of their departments, and assist in handling them. The methods for collecting and discovering problems are: (1) Observe and discover problems through their own work activities; (2) Use methods such as meetings and individual talks to frequently delve into the masses to discover problems and listen to the opinions of the masses; (3) Collect complaints and applications from the masses through people's opinion boxes; (4) Establish close contact with the People's Complaint Reception Room and assist each other in their work.

    II. People's Supervision Committees at all levels should strengthen the leadership of People's Complaint Reception Rooms that have been established during the "Three-Anti" movement; those that have not been established should be established quickly. The task of the People's Complaint Reception Room is mainly to be responsible for accepting and handling complaints and applications from the masses. The cadres who work in the People's Complaint Reception Room must have a strong mass perspective, a certain level of policy understanding, be conscientious and responsible for their work, and be enthusiastic and sincere to the masses. Complaints and applications from the masses, whether written or oral, should be accepted and handled seriously. In order to facilitate people's complaints, the reception procedures must be simple, and the handling of problems must be quick.

    III. In addition to setting up people's opinion boxes inside government organs and enterprise departments at all levels, People's Supervision Committees should, in appropriate places in residential areas or public places, in conjunction with the development of People's Supervision Correspondents, plan to set up people's opinion boxes, which will be managed by the People's Supervision Correspondents. People's opinion boxes must be opened and checked regularly every day and handled quickly to avoid backlog of the opinions of the people.

    IV. People's governments at all levels and supervision organs of people's governments at all levels, as well as various departments of the government, must handle the reports and opinions of the people and People's Supervision Correspondents in accordance with the "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People's Work" promulgated by the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on June 7, 1951. Those that should be handed over to lower levels or other organs for handling must be transferred in a timely manner, and inspections and expediting should be carried out at any time, and the handling results should be notified to the reporter, opposing the bureaucratic style of simply forwarding official documents without taking responsibility. In order to prevent delays in handling or subjective bias due to prejudice, as well as retaliatory behavior, it is specifically stipulated that: (1) All cases within the scope of the authority of this organ must be investigated and dealt with responsibly, and must not be transferred to lower levels or pushed to other organs for handling. Cases that are not within the scope of the authority of this organ should be transferred to the competent organ and notified to the reporter, and an attitude of ignoring it is not allowed. (2) For those that are handed over to lower levels or other organs for handling, except for important cases, which should be transferred level by level, general cases should be directly sent to avoid delaying time. (3) It must be noted that cases that are reported against general personnel of the organ can be handled by the organ, and cases that are reported against the head of the organ or the organ must be handled by the higher-level organ.

    V. People's governments at all levels and people's supervision organs must strengthen the leadership of People's Supervision Correspondents and People's Complaint Reception Rooms. The key lies in the leadership's attention to this work in ideological terms. It should be recognized that this work is an important method for the people's government to closely connect with the masses and improve its work, and a bureaucratic attitude of indifference is absolutely not allowed. Not only should cadres suitable for this work be equipped, but inspections should also be carried out on a regular basis and experiences summarized. Only in this way can corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and all illegal and disciplinary acts be exposed in a timely manner, so that state organs and their staff are constantly supervised by the people.

    It is hoped that the above instructions will be earnestly studied, implemented, and executed.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于加强人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的指示
    伟大的“三反”和“五反”运动，由于领导与群众相结合，由上而下的检查与由下而上的检举相结合，广泛地发扬了民主，得到广大群众的积极拥护与参加，获得了辉煌的成绩。人民监察通讯员与人民检举接待室在这一运动中起了它应有的作用。为了巩固“三反”、“五反”的成果，防止机关中的“三害”和工商界中的“五毒”继续发生，必须推广人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的组织，并加强其领导，以便通过这种方式密切地联系广大群众，发挥群众性的监督作用，为此指示如下：
    一、普遍发展人民监察通讯员。县（市）以上各级人民政府人民监察委员会（包括专员公署人民监察处），应根据实际情况，在各该级政府机关及企业部门与人民团体中发展人民监察通讯员；大中小城市和县的监察机构还可在所属的城镇及乡村中有重点的发展人民监察通讯员；各部门的监察机构，应于其本机关所属企业单位内发展人民监察通讯员。发展的办法，应由各级人民监察委员会或各部门监察机构与有关机关、企业单位商订计划逐步发展。为加强人民监察通讯员与群众的联系，人民监察通讯员的产生，应通过民主方式，推选“三反”“五反”运动中生产、工作中的积极分子，并具备公正负责、忠实勇敢、善于联系群众等条件者，为人民监察通讯员，由各级人民监察委员会或部门监察机构审查任命与领导。同一机关或地区有人民监察通讯员三人以上者，应组成小组，推选组长，负责与其所隶属的监委或部门监察机构联系，以便传达指示，研究问题，交流经验，改进工作。
    人民监察通讯员的任务是调查政府机关、企业部门及其工作人员之贪污、浪费、官僚主义和消极怠工等一切违法乱纪，损害国家或人民利益等情况；并征集群众对政府政策法令设施的意见，向上级监察机关及本部门首长报告并协助处理。其搜集与发现问题的方法是：（1）通过自己工作活动，观察和发现问题；（2）用会谈和个别谈话等方式，经常地深入群众发现问题和倾听群众的意见；（3）通过人民意见箱收集群众的控诉和申请；（4）与人民检举接待室取得密切联系，互相协助工作。
    二、各级人民监察委员会在“三反”运动中已设立人民检举接待室者，应加强领导；未设立者，应迅速设立。人民检举接待室的任务，主要是负责接受与处理群众的控诉和申请。担任人民检举接待室工作的干部，必须有坚强的群众观点，有一定的政策水平，对工作认真负责，对群众热情诚恳。群众的控诉和申请，无论书面的或口头的，均应接受并认真处理。为了便利人民检举，接待手续必须简便，处理问题必须迅速。
    三、除各级人民政府机关及企业部门内部均应设置人民意见箱外，人民监察委员会应在居民中适当地方或公共场所，配合人民监察通讯员的发展，有计划地设置人民意见箱，由人民监察通讯员掌管。人民意见箱必须每日定时开检，迅速处理，以免积压人民群众的意见。
    四、各级人民政府和各级人民政府监察机关以及政府各部门，对于人民群众和人民监察通讯员的检举和意见，必须遵照中央人民政府政务院一九五一年六月七日公布的“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”，认真处理，应交下级或其他机关办理者，必须及时转送，随时检查催办，并将处理结果通知检举人，反对公文照转不负责任的官僚主义作风。为了防止处理中发生拖延或因有成见而主观片面以及采取报复行为，特规定：（一）凡属本机关权限范围内的案件，必须负责查处，不得转交下级或推给别机关办理。不属于本机关权限范围的案件，应负责转交主管机关并通知检举人，不许采取置之不理的态度。（二）凡交下级或其他机关办理者，除重要案件，应按级转交外，一般案件均应直接送交，以免耽误时日。（三）必须注意，案件系检举该机关一般人员者可交该机关办理，系检举该机关首长或机关者，必须交上一级机关办理。
    五、各级人民政府和人民监察机关必须加强人民监察通讯员、人民检举接待室的领导，其关键在于领导思想上对此项工作的重视。应该认识此项工作是人民政府密切联系群众和改善工作的重要方法，绝不容许采取漠不关心的官僚主义态度。不仅要配备适宜此项工作的干部，并应按期进行检查和总结经验。只有如此，才能及时揭发贪污、浪费、官僚主义及一切违法乱纪行为，使国家机关及其工作人员经常受到人民群众的监督。
    以上指示，望切实研究贯彻执行。
    总理　周恩来
    一九五二年八月十九日
