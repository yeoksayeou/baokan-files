What are the reasons we have neglected to promote advanced working methods?

　　                                      Wang Jianxin, Director of Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau

    At the end of May this year, the work team of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government came to the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau to inspect our work and focused on criticizing us for not promoting advanced working methods. For example, when Chang'an Station promoted the Li Xikui shunting method, they believed that it was not possible to implement Li Xikui's continuous shunting method on the main line because there was no lead track, and they were afraid of accidents without scientific basis. Comrades who had returned from Qingdao and Hangzhou after learning advanced working methods did not earnestly implement advanced working methods into actual work.

    After the criticism from the Ministry of Railways work team, we conducted a work review and believed that the criticism from the Ministry of Railways work team was correct and precisely revealed the main shortcomings in our leadership work. The main reason why we neglected to promote advanced working methods was, first of all, because our leading ideology has always been that we must conscientiously implement democratic reforms, carry out the "Three-Anti" Movement, and lay a solid foundation politically before we can improve production. We did not pay attention to guiding the production enthusiasm generated by the masses in political movements to production at any time during the above movements, and pushing production forward. Therefore, in the process of the above movements, only individual cadres led production, and there was no timely collective discussion on how to promote advanced working methods.

    Secondly, we had complacency. We won the Zhengzhou Railway Administration's excellent red flag in February, March and April of 1951, and we won the national excellent red flag twice in October 1951 and April 1952. Although we also shouted to guard against arrogance and rashness, complacency actually existed. Since we thought we were doing well, it was not easy to accept new things. Chang'an Station implemented the Li Xikui shunting method, which doubled work efficiency, and we felt that was enough. This complacency is an obstacle to our promotion of advanced working methods.

    Thirdly, some cadres' conservative ideas were very serious, and we did not educate them or correct this erroneous thinking in time, which also hindered the promotion of advanced experience. For example, the technology section is the brain of transportation work, but they do not study or learn advanced experience, and even have confrontational emotions. The dispatching office is our traffic command, but some personnel have relatively serious sectarian guild ideas, and we have not corrected them in time.

    In addition, when we promoted advanced working methods, they were arranged by the transportation department to the transportation section, and by the transportation section to the station. Administrative cadres and the Party committee, trade union, and Youth League did not act in unison to ensure the completion of this work. Therefore, it formed a situation where we only relied on administrative orders and did not make it a mass movement.

    Now we have recognized these shortcomings, and we must universally and thoroughly examine the erroneous thinking of neglecting to promote advanced experience. Our leading cadres must first understand advanced working methods.

    We have decided to start advanced working methods training classes for the vehicle, locomotive, and engineering departments in early July, and closely combine learning advanced working methods with promoting advanced working methods by learning, reviewing, and implementing. Starting on July 1st, we will focus on Chang'an Station to earnestly implement daily plans, shift plans, and implement the Li Xikui shunting method; and we will organize special personnel in Baoji, Xianyang, Tongguan and other stations to learn the Li Xikui shunting method. We will also establish an advanced working methods committee to plan and lead the promotion of advanced working methods, and promptly check and supervise.

    As long as our leading cadres have clear ideas, and on the basis of the high awareness of the broad masses of workers, we believe that we will definitely do a good job in promoting advanced working methods.

    After the "waste oil recovery dry distillation method" created by Li Zhaozhang, a worker at the Taiyuan Printing Factory, was published in the Taiyuan Daily, it was subsequently published in newspapers in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and other places. This advanced experience has attracted attention from all over the country. Many units and readers have written to the Taiyuan Printing Factory to inquire about the specific methods. A factory in Changchun City, Northeast China, even sent representatives to Taiyuan for experiments and visits. After four days of experiments and inspections, they felt that this experience was very good, and went to Qingdao to visit Li Zhaozhang, the creator of the "waste oil recovery dry distillation method" who was recuperating there, and asked Li Zhaozhang to go to Changchun to provide specific help. This shows that Li Zhaozhang's "waste oil recovery dry distillation method" experience is of great value for increasing production and practicing economy.

    In Taiyuan, after this experience was discovered and published, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting of grassroots trade union cadres and technicians, invited Li Zhaozhang to make a report, and studied the promotion methods. Then, they organized everyone to conduct on-site experiments and visits, and compiled the "waste oil recovery dry distillation method" into a booklet and distributed it. Up to now, Taiyuan Tobacco Factory, Taiyuan Machine Factory, Shanxi Provincial Machinery Company, Shanxi Coal Mine, Liberation Printing Factory, etc., have actively prepared and experimented in order to promote this advanced experience. After the Machinery Company's experiment, it has recovered one-third of the oil from waste oil gauze. Because they valued and learned this experience, they saved a lot of wealth for the country. However, some leading cadres (including trade union cadres and administrative cadres) of some units did not pay due attention to this advanced experience. They treated the creation of the masses with a bureaucratic attitude, and therefore could not fully and comprehensively promote this experience.

    For example, some administrative leading cadres are extremely dismissive of the experience of the "waste oil recovery dry distillation method." They said, "This experience existed in the eighteenth century, why make a fuss?"; "These small experiences are nothing remarkable! Our underground oil is two feet deep, why bother to extract that little bit of oil from waste oil cloth." Their attitude has aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers. Workers in the repair workshop of a factory reflected: "After we participated in the 'waste oil recovery dry distillation method' promotion meeting and experiment visit, we really wanted to promote this experience quickly. We took the initiative to report to the leadership, actively borrowed tools and equipment, and conducted experiments. We sent the five taels of oil we experimented with to the administrative production technology section and asked them to analyze it and give us help and guidance. As a result, they left it for seven or eight days. Because some equipment and tools were borrowed from other departments, and they were in a hurry to use them, we felt that it was difficult to promote this experience, and we were discouraged. As a result, we poured out the oil we experimented with! We also sent the furniture back to them!" Until now, the workshop has not taken any action to promote this experience. Some workers, seeing that it was useless to make suggestions to the leadership, bravely submitted articles to the Shanxi Daily for criticism. But this still did not arouse the vigilance of some cadres. They neither examined nor corrected.

    In addition, some trade union cadres also have wrong ideas. They neither help the masses, support the opinions of the masses, nor patiently assist the administration and earnestly promote this experience. Some people say: "Our central task is competition, and we can't take care of promoting these experiences." Others often use "preparing furniture" as an excuse to delay time. This is obviously wrong.

    Why do these phenomena occur? The key problem is that these leading cadres do not have a sufficient or correct understanding of the significance of increasing production and practicing economy and the power of the masses. They did not regard Li Zhaozhang's creation as a major contribution to saving machine oil. The Taiyuan Printing Factory is a small factory and has already recovered 120 catties of oil from waste oil cloth. This is a great achievement. Some factories collect thousands of catties of waste oil cloth every month. If they are all recycled, the wealth saved for the country would be even greater. Those who look down on the advanced experience of the masses do not understand that any successful experience comes from small to large and from continuous improvement. The process of Li Zhaozhang creating the "waste oil recovery dry distillation method" is a good illustration. He saw that the factory sent people to pull the waste oil cloth out and dump it outside the factory. Starting from feeling sorry for the country's property, he slowly explored a solution to this waste - the "waste oil recovery dry distillation method." This is starting from a small place and solving a big problem.

    The examples of some factories in Taiyuan fully illustrate that leading cadres must thoroughly eliminate bureaucratic work styles, otherwise advanced experience cannot be promoted.

### 怎样推广工业的先进经济？

    我们忽视推广先进工作方法的原因何在？
    西安铁路分局局长  王见新
    今年五月底，中央人民政府铁道部工作组到西安铁路分局，检查了我们的工作，着重地批评了我们没有推广先进工作方法。例如长安车站在推广李锡奎调车法时，认为没有牵出线，在正线上不能实行李锡奎的连续溜放法，没有科学根据地害怕出事故。从青岛和杭州等地学习了先进工作方法回来的同志们，也没有认真地把先进工作方法贯彻到实际工作中去。
    在铁道部工作组的批评之后，我们检查了一次工作，认为铁道部工作组的批评是正确的，正好揭发了我们领导工作上的主要缺点。我们忽视推广先进工作方法的主要原因，首先是因为我们在领导思想上一直认为：必须认真实行民主改革，开展“三反”运动，在政治上打下巩固的基础，才能把生产搞好。而没有注意在民主改革、“三反”运动当中，把群众在政治运动中所生长起来的生产热情，随时引导到生产中去，把生产推向前进。因此，在以上运动的过程中，只有个别干部领导生产，没有适时地集体讨论如何推广先进工作方法的问题。
    其次，我们有自满情绪。我们在一九五一年二、三、四月份连获郑州铁路管理局的优胜红旗，在一九五一年十月和一九五二年四月，我们又两次获得了全国优胜红旗。虽然我们也喊着戒骄戒躁，但实际上自满情绪是存在的。我们既然认为自己还不错，就不容易接受新鲜事物了。长安车站实行了李锡奎调车法，把工作效率提高了一倍，我们就觉得差不多了。这种自满情绪，是我们推行先进工作方法的障碍。
    再次，有些干部的保守思想十分严重，我们没有进行教育，及时纠正这种错误思想，也妨碍了先进经验的推广。例如技术股是运输工作的大脑，他们不钻研、不学习先进经验，甚至有对抗的情绪。调度所是我们的行车指挥部，但是有些人员有比较严重的宗派行会思想，我们也没有及时给予纠正。
    另外，我们推广先进工作方法，都是由运输处布置到运输科，由运输科布置到车站，行政干部和党委、工会、青年团没有一致行动来保证这一工作的完成，因此，就形成了光靠行政命令行事，而没有使之形成群众运动。
    现在我们已经认识这些缺点，我们要普遍地彻底地检查忽视推广先进经验的错误思想，我们的领导干部首先要懂得先进工作方法。
    我们决定从七月上旬，开办车务、机务和工务等部门的先进工作方法的训练班，用边学习、边检查、边实行的办法，把学习先进工作方法和推广先进工作方法紧密地结合起来。在七月一日开始以长安车站为重点认真执行日计划、班计划和贯彻李锡奎调车法；并且在宝鸡、咸阳、潼关等车站组织专人学习李锡奎调车法。我们还要成立先进工作方法委员会，有计划地领导先进工作方法的推广工作，并及时地检查和督促。
    只要我们领导干部思想明确，在广大工人群众的高度觉悟的基础上，我们相信我们一定会做好先进工作方法的推广工作。
    推广先进经验必须同官僚主义作斗争

    太原印刷厂工人李兆璋创造的“废油回收干溜法”，在太原日报发表以后，继之在北京、天津、上海等地的报纸上也都先后登载了。这个先进经验已引起全国各地的重视。不少单位和读者都写信给太原印刷厂询问具体作法，东北长春市某厂还派代表前来太原实验、参观。他们经四天的实验、考察，感到这一经验很好，并到青岛访问正在该处休养的“废油回收干溜法”的创造者——李兆璋，要求李兆璋到长春去给以具体帮助。这说明了李兆璋的“废油回收干溜法”经验对增产节约是有极大的价值的。
    在太原，这一经验发现和发表之后，市总工会召集了各基层工会干部和技术工人会议，请李兆璋作了报告，也研究了推广的方法。接着又组织大家去现场实验、参观，并将“废油回收干溜法”汇印成小册子发了下去。到现在为止，太原烟草厂、太原机器厂、山西省机器公司、山西煤矿、解放印刷厂等，为了推广这一先进经验，都积极进行了准备和试验，机器公司试验后，已从废油纱布中收回三分之一的油量。由于他们重视和学习了这一经验，就为国家节约了不少财富。但是，也有某些单位的领导干部（包括工会干部和行政干部），对这一先进经验并未引起应有的重视，他们以官僚主义的态度对待群众的创造，因而也就不能充分地全面地把这一经验推广起来。
    比如，有些行政领导干部，对“废油回收干溜法”的经验是极其轻视的，他们说：“这个经验十八世纪就有了，何必大惊小怪”；“这些小经验，有什么了不起！咱们地下油有二尺深，还在乎从废油布中去取那一小点油。”他们的这种态度，已引起了工人的不满。某厂修造车间工人反映：“我们参加‘废油回收干溜法’推广会议及实验参观回厂以后，心里很想快点推广这一经验，就主动向领导方面报告，并积极借工具、搞设备，进行试验。我们把试验出来的五两油送交行政生产技术科，让他们加以分析，给我们以帮助指导，结果，他们一放就是七、八天。因为有些设备、工具系借其他部门的，人家又急着要，我们感到这一经验的推广很困难，我们也泄了气，结果，把试验出来的油也倒啦！家具也给人家送去了！”直到现在该车间对这
    一经验的推广毫无动静。有的工人看到向领导方面提也不顶事，他们就勇敢地向山西日报投稿提出批评。但这仍未引起某些干部的警惕，他们既不检讨，也不纠正。
    此外，某些工会干部也有错误思想，他们既不帮助群众、支持群众的意见，又不耐心地去协助行政、认真地推广这个经验。有人说：“我们中心工作是竞赛，顾不上推广这些经验。”也有的人，常以
    “正在准备家具”为藉口来拖延时间。这显然是错误的。
    为什么产生这些现象呢？关键问题是这些领导干部对增产节约的意义和群众的力量认识不足或认识的不正确，他们没有把李兆璋的创举看成是节约机器油料的一项重大的贡献。太原印刷厂是一个小厂子，已从废油布中取回一百二十斤油了，这是一个很大的成绩。有的厂子每月总要收集废油布成千上万斤，如果都加以回收，为国家节约财富就更大了。看不起群众的先进经验的人，不了解任何的成功经验都是由小到大、从不断改进中来的，李兆璋创造“废油回收干溜法”的过程，就是一个很好的说明。他看见厂里派人把废油布拉出倒在厂外，他从可惜国家财产出发，慢慢地摸索出解决这一浪费的办法——“废油回收干溜法”。这就是从小处入手、解决了大的问题。
    太原某些工厂的例子，充分说明了领导干部必须彻底肃清官僚主义作风，否则先进经验就不可能推广。
