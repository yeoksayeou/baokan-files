    Guizhou Logging Company Should Not Depress Timber Purchase Prices
    Comrade Editor: In order to take care of the livelihood of minority peoples, the Guangxi Provincial Timber Company and the Guizhou Provincial Logging Company have respectively established purchasing stations in Geliang Village, Fuluxiang, Sanjiang County, Guangxi Province, and are purchasing large quantities of timber. However, cadres of the Guizhou Provincial Logging Company have a purely profit-seeking viewpoint and have set the timber purchase prices too low. For example, the Guangxi Timber Company's Fuluxiang purchasing station purchases fir wood with a two-foot circumference for 120,000 yuan, while the Guizhou Provincial Logging Company only gives 60,000 yuan, causing dissatisfaction among the minority peoples of Guizhou Province. They said, "The two units are purchasing timber in the same place, so why are the prices different?" This has created a very bad political impact. It is hoped that the cadres of the Guizhou Provincial Logging Company will overcome their purely profit-seeking viewpoint, reasonably increase timber purchase prices, and take care of the livelihood of minority peoples.

    贵州省伐木公司不该压价收购木材
    编辑同志：为照顾少数民族人民的生活，广西省木材公司和贵州省伐木公司在广西省三江县富禄乡葛亮村分别设立了收购点，大量收购木材。但贵州省伐木公司干部有单纯营利观点，把收购木材价格订的过低。如二尺围的杉木，广西木材公司富禄收购站收购价格是十二万元，贵州省伐木公司却只给六万元，引起贵州省少数民族人民不满。他们说：“两个单位同在一地收购木材，为什么价格不同？”造成了很坏的政治影响。希望贵州省伐木公司的干部，克服单纯营利观点，合理地提高木材收购价格，照顾少数民族人民的生活。
