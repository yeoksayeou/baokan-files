    Standing at the Forefront of Economic Construction
    —Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Liberation Army
    Tang Tianji
    The great "August 1st" Army Day has arrived. When we commemorate this year's "August 1st," we are in a new and favorable period. On the basis of the great victories of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, our country's large-scale economic construction tasks are coming to us more and more every day. The central task of the people of the whole country at present is, on the one hand, to continue to strengthen the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and fight to consolidate our national defense, and on the other hand, to joyfully greet the arrival of the high tide of national economic construction, regardless of the enemy's obstruction.
    On the front of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, the US imperialists have suffered severe blows as a result of the joint operations of the Chinese and Korean people over the past two years, and the fate of the aggressive bloc is doomed to failure. On the economic construction front, industrial and agricultural production have both recovered and partially exceeded the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan levels in the past two or three years, and we have begun some large-scale construction projects, such as the construction and completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the harnessing of the Huai River, and the Jingjiang River flood diversion project. As a result, the prospect of a prosperous and strong new China is displayed before the people of the whole country. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party and with the strong assistance of the powerful world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, as long as the people of the whole country continue to make unremitting efforts, we will surely achieve great victories in war and construction, and smoothly and rapidly complete the new democratic construction, and move from new democracy to socialist and communist society.
    From the very first day of its founding, the People's Liberation Army has shouldered the dual tasks of war and construction. As early as the Gutian Conference in 1929, Chairman Mao pointed out that "the Chinese Red Army is an armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao personally launched the troops to engage in agricultural and handicraft production, calling on them to overcome difficulties by their own efforts, in order to build anti-Japanese base areas. This instruction is a different reminder of Chairman Mao's military building thought of combining war and construction under different circumstances, and is extremely brilliant and far-sighted.
    In order to implement Chairman Mao's call, 100,000 troops participated in the great Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project in April this year. The results of the work in the past three months have once again proved the correctness of Chairman Mao's great thought, fully confirming that the People's Liberation Army is not only an invincible fighting force, but also a powerful construction force, and powerfully refuting the erroneous arguments of some people who believe that the People's Liberation Army "can only fight, but cannot build," and "can only engage in agricultural production, but cannot engage in industrial construction."
    Our 100,000 engineering troops have played a backbone role in this Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project under the correct leadership and constant encouragement of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and the Central and South Military Region, and with the support of the broad masses of the people and the direct cooperation of workers and peasants. Its main manifestations are in the following three aspects:
    First, it undertook the most arduous and difficult tasks in the entire project. For example, the silt removal of Huangtian Lake and the damming of Huangshantou were all completed mainly by the troops. The lake water and silt in Huangtian Lake were as deep as three or four meters. Our soldiers not only had to remove more than 50,000 cubic meters of silt in one go, but also had to remove the accumulated water after the rain in order to cut off the lake surface horizontally and build a new embankment more than 700 meters long. In the middle of this, there were many difficulties, especially the stinging wild water chestnuts all over the lake, which pricked many people and tore their feet, but the soldiers regarded working as fighting and eliminating the enemy, and were not afraid of being injured and bleeding, and persisted until the final victory. When technical conditions were insufficient and new tools were lacking, they used washbasins, cloth wrappers, and buckets to replace silt removal tools, dug silt with their hands, and blocked mud with their bodies. When building a dam 135 meters wide and 500 meters long across the Hutudu River with a water depth of 3.8 meters at the waist, it was just when the water was rising everywhere and the situation was critical. Our soldiers were working day and night in shifts, rain or shine, and thus achieved the victory of the closure of the Hutudu River Dam.
    Secondly, the People's Liberation Army completed the largest task and had the highest work efficiency in the entire project. Among the 100,000 troops, the number of people participating in on-site labor accounted for 83 percent of the entire troop, and other personnel accounted for only 17 percent. However, the military workers, who accounted for less than one-third of the total number of 300,000 construction workers, completed 49 percent of the earthwork and 73 percent of the concrete in the entire project; overfulfilled the earthwork by 40 percent, and enabled the concrete to be completed 5,800 cubic meters in one day, and the wharf to unload 20,000 tons in one day. In terms of work efficiency, for example, when digging the foundation of the North Sluice, when the average earthwork efficiency of the civilian workers was 0.52 cubic meters, the troops reached 1.25 cubic meters. For example, the troops responsible for tying the steel bars of the North Sluice always insisted on not stopping work regardless of rain or night. This exemplary action and backbone role aroused the great respect and admiration of the worker and peasant brothers. As they said, "Where there is an army, there will be victory," and they were willing to work with the People's Liberation Army.
    Thirdly, the People's Liberation Army also learned technology the fastest. Some technicians were skeptical about whether the comrades of the troops could learn technology, and were not willing to actively teach it, thinking that the time was short and they would not be able to learn it. In order to learn the technology, the soldiers used forums to make friends and talk about their innermost thoughts to approach the technical workers, and actively helped them with odd jobs. In these practical contacts, the unity between technicians and soldiers was greatly strengthened, and they signed guarantees of "teaching well and learning well." Some soldiers mastered the proportion and mixing method of water and cement in only one week, and learned to manage the machine and understood the performance of the machine in half a month. Many people said, "Our People's Liberation Army learns really fast. Even a college student would have to spend at least a year to learn how to mix," and "The Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project is actually a university for 300,000 people."
    Why can the People's Liberation Army have outstanding performance in the above three aspects and become the backbone in the modern new water conservancy construction? This is because the People's Liberation Army is originally the most organized, the most disciplined, and the most conscious outstanding children of workers and peasants. Under the direct leadership of the Party, in the long-term revolutionary struggle, it has a glorious tradition of hard work, bravery, and tenacity, and has cultivated the noble qualities of loving labor, loving the motherland, loving the people, loving science, and cherishing public property, so it is most capable of overcoming difficulties and overcoming difficulties.
    Because the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project is quite large in scale, and is restricted by time and terrain, it is indeed unusually difficult, especially the time is tight, the construction is hasty, and there are too many rainy days, coupled with inconvenient transportation, few residents in the work area, and immigration is underway, our technical level and technical conditions are insufficient, and we are afraid that floods will occur in July, so there are many difficulties. In order to race against time with the flood, we must vigorously improve work efficiency, and only by seizing time and improving work efficiency can we overcome all difficulties.
    How can we seize time and improve work efficiency? First of all, we must overcome the natural obstacles of too many rainy days. Because rainy weather is not conducive to construction, not only is the mud deep and the road is slippery, and the work efficiency is not high, but also the soil is wet and not easy to use, which affects the quality. Especially for drainage projects, after drainage, there will be accumulated water in case of rain, and some water cannot be completely drained. Therefore, we have to work day and night without stopping to race against time; we have to adopt the method of "cherishing every inch of time" and "cherishing every minute of time" to make rational use of every minute and every second. For this reason, in addition to working day and night, rain or shine, working in shifts day and night, without missing work, and strengthening labor, we must also try every means to improve work efficiency and shorten working time to do more work, so as to achieve fast, good, and economical results. Under such a united situation, many amazing creations have emerged in the troops. For example, in earthwork projects, the average work efficiency reached 2.02 cubic meters of soil per work within the average transportation distance of 80 to 120 meters, which is not only twice as high as before liberation, but also 31% higher than the Huai River control project.
    In terms of concrete, the highest monthly average work efficiency is 0.394 cubic meters per work, which is 16% higher than before liberation and 12% higher than the Huai River control project, that is, 5% higher than the local technicians. At the same time, many outstanding figures have also emerged: For example, Dai Guofa, a soldier from the Fifth Company of the 713th Detachment, created the highest record of carrying 15.1 cubic meters of soil a day within a transportation distance of 119 meters. Liu Daohui, a soldier from the Eighth Company of the 713th Detachment, created the achievement of digging and carrying 11.4 cubic meters of soil by himself within nine working hours at a transportation distance of 200 meters; Qi Shouzhen, a soldier from the Fourth Temporary Regiment, regularly recorded 3 cubic meters of soil per day within a transportation distance of 1,240 meters, etc. These are all great achievements obtained by carrying forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, and the emergence of these exemplary deeds is closely related to the noble qualities of the People's Liberation Army soldiers. This is how we seize time to improve work efficiency, overcome difficulties, and complete the project tasks ahead of schedule with the cooperation of the broad masses of workers and peasants.
    In the process of completing the project tasks, we carried out a series of ideological mobilization and education work for the troops, so that all commanders and fighters recognized the importance of participating in national construction, and thus their awareness was greatly improved, and their work enthusiasm and creativity were greatly developed. First of all, we emphasized educating everyone on the correct understanding of the relationship between economic construction and consolidating national defense. Without a highly developed economic construction, there is no way to strengthen national defense; and without a strong national defense, it is impossible to defend peace and prevent war, so that the country's economic construction can move forward by leaps and bounds. Secondly, we explained that the People's Liberation Army is both a fighting force and a working force, which is the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army. We should participate in the country's economic construction with a high degree of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, just like participating in the war in the past.
    Our past goal of winning the war was to create a better and happier life for the people. Today, it is to build a prosperous and strong new democratic new China, and tomorrow we will build a socialist and communist society. The heroic combat, bloodshed, and sacrifice of the People's Liberation Army for more than 20 years are also for the happiness of the people of the whole country, so the ultimate goals of war and construction are the same.
    We called on all commanders and fighters to strive to carry forward revolutionary heroism, carry out revolutionary competitions, and educate the troops with vivid exemplary deeds, thus promoting the patriotic labor competition movement of the entire troop.
    The 100,000 strong and resolute People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters have already achieved victory on the front of national economic construction. This force is heroic on the battlefield, and has become a model in construction.
    We believe that the People's Liberation Army, which is both a fighting force and a working force, will not only be a strong force to defend the motherland and defend the cause of peace in the future, but will also continue to become a new force participating in the country's economic construction. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, in the future cause of national economic construction, the people's soldiers will continue to respond and cooperate with the working people of the whole country with high patriotic labor enthusiasm, unlimited learning spirit and creative spirit, and collectivist production methods, and strive for continuous new and great victories to establish a strong economic force, lay a solid material foundation for building a modernized national defense army, combine national defense construction and economic construction, and let the People's Liberation Army become a stronger pillar of the country's security and peace.

    站在经济建设的前线
    ——庆祝人民解放军建军二十五周年
    唐天际
    伟大的“八一”建军节来到了，纪念今年“八一”的时候，我们是处在一个新的有利的时期，在伟大的抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上，我们国家的大规模经济建设任务，正在一天比一天来到我们的面前，全国人民当前的中心任务，一方面是继续加强抗美援朝，并为巩固我们国防而斗争，另一方面则是不顾敌人的阻扰而欢欣鼓舞地迎接祖国经济建设高潮的到来。
    在抗美援朝的战线上，两年来，由于中朝人民并肩作战的结果，美帝国主义已遭受到严重的打击，注定了侵略集团必然失败的命运。在经济建设的战线上，两三年来，工、农业生产都已恢复并部分超过了抗日战争以前的水平，我们又开始了某些规模巨大的工程建设，如成渝铁路、治理淮河和荆江分洪等工程的兴建与完工。由此，在全国人民面前展示了新中国繁荣富强的远景。在中国共产党毛主席的英明领导下，在以苏联为首的强大的世界和平民主阵营的有力援助下，只要全国人民继续不懈的努力，我们就一定能够取得战争与建设的伟大胜利，将顺利地、迅速地完成新民主主义建设，由新民主主义走向社会主义和共产主义社会。
    人民解放军从建军的第一天起，就担负了战争与建设两重的任务。毛主席一九二九年在古田会议就指出了“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”。在抗日战争中，毛主席亲自发动了部队从事农业、手工业生产，号召自己动手克服困难，以建设抗日根据地。这一指示，就是毛主席的战争与建设相结合的建军思想在不同情况下的不同的提示，是极其英明和极有远见的。
    为执行毛主席的号召，今年四月有十万部队参加了伟大的荆江分洪工程，三个月来的工作成果，又一次证明了毛主席伟大思想的正确，充分地证实了人民解放军不仅是一支无敌的战斗队，也是一支强大的建设大军，有力地驳斥了某些人以为人民解放军“只会打仗，不会建设”、“只会农业生产，不会工业建设”的错误论调。
    我们十万工程部队在毛主席、朱总司令和人民革命军事委员会、中南军区的正确领导和不断的鼓舞下，在全国广大人民的支援和工人农民直接配合下，在这次荆江分洪工程中是起到了骨干作用的。其主要表现以下三个方面：
    首先是担负了整个工程中最艰巨、最困难的任务。如黄天湖的排淤，黄山头的堵坝，都是以部队为主来完成的。黄天湖中的湖水淤泥深达三、四公尺，我们战士们不仅要一口气把五万多公方淤泥排完，还要排除雨后的积水，以便横截湖面，建筑一条七百多公尺长的新堤。这中间，困难很多，特别是满湖刺人的野菱角，使许多人扎上了刺，拉破了脚，但战士们把做工当作打仗消灭敌人，不怕负伤流血，一直坚持到最后胜利。当技术条件不够，缺乏新式工具时，他们就用脸盆、包袱皮、水桶代替排淤工具，用手扒淤泥，用身子挡泥浆。在腰斩水深三点八公尺的虎渡河水建筑一条宽一百三十五公尺、长五百公尺的拦河大坝时，正值四处水涨，情况危急，我们战士都是日夜轮班风雨无阻地抢修，因而取得了虎渡河坝合龙的胜利。
    其次是人民解放军在整个工程中，完成的任务最大、工效最高。在这十万部队中参加工地劳动的人数，占整个部队的百分之八十三，其他人员仅占百分之十七。而占全部三十万施工人数的三分之一弱的军工，却完成了全部工程中土方的百分之四十九，混凝土的百分之七十三；超额完成土方百分之四十，并使混凝土在一天内能完成五千八百公方，码头起卸一天能完成二万吨。在工效方面，如挖北闸闸基，当民工平均土方工效为零点五二公方时，部队即达一点二五公方。又如担任北闸扎钢筋的部队，无论天雨黑夜，始终坚持不收工，这种模范行动和骨干作用，引起了工农弟兄的极大尊敬与钦佩，如说：“那里有军队，那里就能胜利”，都愿与解放军一起工作。
    再次人民解放军学习技术也最快。曾有部分技术人员，对于部队同志能学会技术表示怀疑，不大愿意积极传授，认为时间短，他们学不会。战士们为了学会技术，就利用座谈会交朋友谈知心话等方式来接近技术工人，并积极帮助他们做杂工，在这些实际接触中，技工与战士之间的团结大大加强，纷纷订立了“教好学好”的保证，战士们有的只一个星期就掌握了水与洋灰掺合的比例及拌合法，半个月就学会了管理机器，并懂得了机器的性能，许多人说：“咱们解放军学得真快，就是大学生要学会拌合机最少也得一年”，“荆江分洪工程，实际上就是三十万人的大学校”。
    为什么人民解放军能够在上述三个方面有突出的表现，能够在近代化新式的水利建设上成为骨干呢？这是因为人民解放军本来就是最有组织、最有纪律、最有觉悟的工人和农民的优秀子弟，在党的直接领导下，在长期的革命斗争中，有着刻苦耐劳、勇敢顽强的光荣传统，养成了热爱劳动、热爱祖国、热爱人民、热爱科学和爱护公共财物的高尚素质，因而最能战胜困难和克服困难。
    由于荆江分洪工程规模相当巨大，又受时间与地形等的限制，的确是有着异常困难的，特别是时间紧迫、施工仓促和雨日太多，再加上交通不便，工区居民不多，又正在进行移民，我们技术水平与技术条件不够，又遇夏季天气很热，江湖地带传染病易于流行，又惟恐七月要发洪水，因此困难重重。为了与洪水抢时间，就不得不大力提高工效，只有争取时间提高工效才能战胜一切困难。
    我们怎样来争取时间提高工效呢？首先就要战胜雨日过多的自然障碍。因为天雨不利施工，不仅泥深路滑，工效不大，而且土湿也不好用，影响质量。尤其排水工程，排水之后，遇雨又有积水，有的无法把水排完。因此就不能不昼夜不停的施工，抢时间；不能不采取“惜寸阴”、“惜分阴”的办法，使每一分每一秒钟都能合理利用。为此，除了不分昼夜，不分晴雨，日夜轮班，不误工，加强劳作外，还要想尽一切办法提高工效缩短工作时间，做更多的工作，以达到又快、又好、又节省。在这样的团结情况下，部队中出现了许多惊人的创造。如土方工程，在八十到一百二十公尺的平均运距内，平均工效每工达二点零二公方土，不仅较解放前提高了一倍，较治淮工程也提高了百分之三十
    一。在混凝土方面，最高一个月的平均工效是每工零点三九四公方，较解放前增加了百分之十六，较治淮也增加了百分之十二，即较同地的技工，也增加了百分之五。同时也出现了许多的突出的人物：如七一三支队五连战士戴国法同志，就创造了在运距一百一十九公尺内，一天挑土十五点一公方的最高纪录。七一三支队八连战士刘道辉同志，创造了运距二百公尺，九个工作小时内，自挑自挖十一点四方土的成绩；暂四团战士齐守真在运距一千二百四十公尺中，每天经常能挖三方土的纪录等。这些都是因为我们发扬了人民解放军光荣传统所获的巨大成效，这些模范的事迹产生，都与解放军战士的高尚素质密切相关。我们就是这样争取时间提高工效，把困难克服了，在广大工农兄弟配合下，把工程任务提早完成了。
    在完成工程任务的过程中，我们对部队进行了一连串的思想动员和教育工作，使全体指战员认识了参加祖国建设的重要性，因而觉悟大大提高，工作的积极性和创造性大大地发挥。首先，我们强调教育大家对经济建设与巩固国防两者的关系的正确认识，没有高度发展的经济建设，就谈不到国防力量的加强；而没有强大的国防力量，就不可能保卫和平和制止战争，使祖国的经济建设大踏步地前进。其次，我们说明了人民解放军是战斗队又是工作队，这是人民解放军的光荣传统。我们应该像过去参加战争一样以高度的爱国主义和革命英雄主义，来参加祖国的经济建设。
    我们过去争取战争胜利的目的是为人民创造美好幸福的生活。在今天，是为了建设繁荣富强的新民主主义的新中国，明天就要进而建设社会主义和共产主义社会，人民解放军二十多年来的英勇作战流血牺牲，也就是为了使全国人民得到幸福，所以战争与建设的最后目的是一致的。
    我们号召全体指战员努力发扬革命英雄主义，开展革命竞赛，并以活生生的模范事迹来教育部队，因而推动了整个部队的爱国劳动竞赛运动。
    十万坚强果敢的人民解放军指战员，在祖国经济建设战线上已经取得胜利了，这支力量在战场上是英雄，在建设上是又成了模范。
    我们相信，既是战斗队又是工作队的人民解放军部队，今后不仅是保卫祖国、保卫和平事业的坚强力量，而且也将继续成为参加祖国经济建设中的一支生力军。在伟大的毛泽东思想指导下，在今后的祖国经济建设事业中，人民战士将继续以高涨的爱国劳动热情，无限的学习精神和创造精神以及集体主义的生产方式，与全国劳动人民呼应配合，努力争取不断的新的伟大胜利，以建立强大的经济力量，以奠定建设现代化国防军的雄厚物质基础，把国防建设和经济建设结合起来，让人民解放军成为祖国安全与和平的更坚强的支柱。
