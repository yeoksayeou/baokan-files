    Ma Wanshui Group Further Improves Operational Methods
    Editor: The Ma Wanshui tunneling team, a labor model at the Longyan Iron Mine, recently successfully created a two-slot pulling, one-shot blasting operation method, which further improved tunneling efficiency. In July, the team used seventeen working days to tunnel 72.19 meters, exceeding the monthly planned task by 1.06 percent.
    In May of this year, when the Longyan Iron Mine summarized the advanced experience of the Ma Wanshui team, it pointed out that on the existing basis, as long as the operation method is slightly improved, the tunneling efficiency can continue to be improved. Based on this instruction, the workers of the Ma Wanshui team continued to study and convened a meeting of the three-shift workers on July 3 to study the operation method of two-slot pulling and one-shot blasting, determine the position of the blast holes, and find a way to equalize the resistance line strength inside the blast holes.
    The method of two-slot pulling and one-shot blasting is: one-time drilling, first drill the two inner holes, then drill the two outer holes (deepening). If the depth of the inner hole is one meter, the outer hole should be drilled to a depth of 1.5 meters. When blasting, first ignite the inner holes, then ignite the outer holes, and one blast can achieve the result of pulling two slots, and the progress can reach 1.2 meters.
    The mine layer they tested was shale. Before the test, they first studied the properties of the rock. During the test, Ma Wanshui participated in the work with concern. The test results of the first two shifts showed that the tunneling efficiency exceeded the previous highest daily output by 35 percent.
    This improvement has further encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the workers in the Ma Wanshui team. They said that they would complete the task ahead of schedule every month in the production increase and economy practice.

    马万水小组进一步改进操作法
    编辑同志：龙烟铁矿劳动模范马万水掘进组，最近创造两次拉槽一次放炮操作法成功，进一步提高了掘进效率。该组七月份用十七个工作日，掘进七十二点一九公尺，超过全月计划任务百分之一点零六。
    今年五月份，龙烟铁矿总结马万水小组先进经验时曾指出，在现有基础上只要稍加改进操作方法，还能继续提高掘进效率。马万水小组的工人根据这个指示，继续钻研，于七月三日召开了三班工人会议，研究了两次拉槽一次放炮的操作法，确定炮眼位置、找出炮眼里面抵抗线力量平均的办法。
    两次拉槽一次放炮的办法是：一次打眼，先打里边两个眼，后打外层两个眼（加深）。若里边眼的深度是一公尺的话，外层眼就要打一点五公尺深。放炮时先点里边眼，后点外层眼，一次爆破得到拉两次槽子的结果，进度可以达到一点二公尺。
    他们试验的矿层是千页岩。试验前，他们首先研究了岩石性质。试验时马万水关心地亲自参加了工作，前两班试验结果，掘进效率就超过过去最高日产量百分之三十五。
    这一改进，更加鼓舞了马万水小组工人们的劳动热情，他们表示要在增产节约运动中，月月提前完成任务。  陆大新
