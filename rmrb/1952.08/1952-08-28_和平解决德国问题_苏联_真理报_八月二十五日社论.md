The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published yesterday the Soviet government's note to the U.S. government regarding a German peace treaty. Similar notes were also sent to the British and French governments.

The Soviet government's note carries the utmost international significance.

The Soviet Union has consistently advocated for a just resolution of the German question, advocating for the return of the German people to the family of peace-loving nations. On May 8, 1952—the seventh anniversary of the German people's liberation from fascist tyranny—Comrade J.V. Stalin wrote: "I sincerely wish the German people and the government of the German Democratic Republic victory in the struggle for the establishment of a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, in the struggle for the earliest possible conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of the occupation forces from Germany, for the sake of Germany and world peace."

The Soviet government has repeatedly proposed reaching a peace agreement with Germany. The great importance of the Soviet note of August 23 lies in the fact that it offers a real possibility for a peaceful and just resolution of the German question.

As everyone knows, the United States, Britain, and France are doing their utmost to evade direct negotiations with the Soviet government on the Soviet draft principles for a peace treaty.

At the same time, they are using all their strength to prolong and deepen the division of Germany, pulling West Germany and the West's three governments' established West German army into the North Atlantic bloc, and using West Germany on a larger scale for this bloc's aggressive activities. This is evidenced by the fact that the Western countries have concluded separate "treaties" and so-called "European Defense Community" "agreements" with the Bonn government.

The Bonn "treaty," imposed on West Germany against the will of the German people, is a blatant war alliance aimed at aggression. It legitimizes the revival of German militarism and the formation of West German mercenary forces commanded by fascist Hitlerite generals. At the same time, it indefinitely extends the occupation of West Germany by the armed forces of the Western countries.

According to the Bonn Treaty, the "privileges" retained by the U.S., British, and French governments give them unlimited possibilities to station their troops on West German territory, declare states of emergency, and wield full power. The Western countries have obtained broad rights to interfere in West Germany's internal affairs, and even the right to use the armed forces of the occupying countries to compel West Germany to submit to them.

Moreover, judging from the text of the Bonn "treaty," the Western countries even want to retain the "privileges" they have obtained and extend them to the whole of Germany if Germany is unified.

In view of these facts, the hypocrisy of the "concern" expressed by the U.S., British, and French governments for the four powers to guarantee the all-German government the necessary freedom of action in the period before the peace treaty comes into effect is all too obvious.

The issue of guarantees raised by the Western countries is directly related to the issue of the powers of the all-German government. In this regard, the Soviet government reiterates that the issue of the powers of the all-German government has already been resolved in the Potsdam Agreement, which explicitly stipulates the principles on which the establishment of a peaceful, democratic, independent, and unified Germany should be based.

It is necessary to point out that the activities of the United States, Britain, and France in West Germany are a clear violation of the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, and they misinterpret the meaning of the Potsdam Conference decisions mentioned in the Soviet government's note of May 24. According to them, it seems that this note advocates the "restoration of the four-power control system." However, in fact, the Soviet government's note of May 24 did not mention the restoration of the four-power control system, but said that it is necessary to abide by the principles of the Potsdam Agreement regarding making Germany a unified, independent, peaceful, and democratic country again.

In its note of August 23, the Soviet government once again emphasized the need to implement the principles stipulated in the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany, that is, Germany has the obligation "not to participate in any groups or military alliances aimed at opposing any country that participated in the war against Germany with its own troops."

Obviously, this clause does not prevent Germany from uniting with other countries for peaceful purposes, but it makes it impossible for Germany to participate in aggressive blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that create the danger of a new world war. This way of framing the question is completely in line with the interests of all countries neighboring Germany, and also in line with Germany's own national interests.

The Soviet government pointed out in its note that the Western countries' view that it is impossible to draft a peace treaty with Germany until an all-German government is formed is completely untenable. The Soviet note recalled that the Potsdam Agreement authorized the Council of Foreign Ministers to prepare a peace treaty with Germany, "which shall be accepted by the German government when a German government fit for the purpose is established."

The attitude of the U.S., British, and French governments is nothing more than an effort to postpone the resolution of the issue of a peace treaty with Germany indefinitely, delaying Germany's restoration of unity, and thereby allowing the occupying forces to remain in Germany indefinitely.

Judging from the notes of the U.S., British, and French governments, the Western countries avoid discussing the German question as a whole, attempting to simplify the matter into the question of how a fact-finding mission to investigate whether Germany has conditions for free elections should be formed, and what responsibilities and powers it should have. In this regard, the U.S., British, and French governments advocate establishing an international fact-finding mission.

The Soviet government's note pointed out that suggesting the establishment of an international fact-finding mission to conduct investigations in Germany is treating Germany as an object of international investigation, which can only be considered an insult to the German nation. Such demands are generally made to backward countries and cannot be made to Germany. The Soviet government believes that a fact-finding mission composed of Germans selected by the Germans themselves with the consent of the four countries—for example, a fact-finding mission composed of representatives of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the Bundestag of the Federal Republic of Germany—would be the most objective fact-finding mission.

As for the question of investigating whether Germany has conditions for holding free elections, the Soviet note stated that "it is necessary first to check the implementation of some of the decisions of the Potsdam Conference, the implementation of which is a necessary prerequisite for holding truly free all-German elections and establishing an all-German government that represents the will of the German people."

The Soviet note pointed out that one of these decisions is the Potsdam Conference's decision on the elimination of German militarism, in order to, as the Potsdam Agreement says, "prevent for all time the resurgence and reorganization of German militarism and Nazism," so that "Germany will never again threaten its neighbors and world peace." Another such decision is to implement the political principles for Germany announced in the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulate that Germany should "destroy the National Socialist Party and its affiliated and supervised institutions, dissolve all Nazi organizations, and ensure that such institutions are not revived in any form, and all Nazi militarist actions and propaganda must be stopped." These principles also include the Potsdam Conference's decision on "preparing for the re-establishment of German political life on a democratic basis and enabling Germany to participate in peaceful cooperation in international life in the future."

The Western countries suggested convening a four-power meeting of representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to discuss only one question—how a fact-finding mission to investigate whether Germany has conditions for free elections should be formed, and what responsibilities and powers it should have.

The Soviet government pointed out in its note that the exchanges of notes between the Soviet Union and the Western countries on this issue have brought the views of both sides somewhat closer, therefore, the Soviet government is willing to discuss the question suggested by the Western countries, but believes that the four-power meeting of representatives should first discuss important issues such as a peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of an all-German government.

The Soviet government suggested that the four-power meeting of representatives convened to discuss the above-mentioned issues should be held as soon as possible, no later than October under any circumstances, and the Soviet government believes that the meeting should also discuss the date for the withdrawal of the occupation forces from Germany. The Soviet government suggested that representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany be invited to participate in the meeting when discussing the above-mentioned issues.

If the Soviet government's suggestions are accepted, it would mean taking a major step forward in peacefully resolving the German question in accordance with the interests of peace and security in Europe and the whole world.

### 和平解决德国问题——苏联“真理报”八月二十五日社论

    和平解决德国问题
    ——苏联“真理报”八月二十五日社论
    “真理报”昨天发表了苏联政府致美国政府的关于对德和约的照会。同时也向英国和法国政府提出了同样的照会。
    苏联政府的照会具有最重大的国际意义。
    苏联一贯主张公正解决德国问题，主张使德国人民重新回到爱好和平国家的大家庭里来。在一九五二年五月八日——德国人民自法西斯暴政下解放七周年纪念日——约·维·斯大林同志写道：“我谨祝德国人民与德意志民主共和国政府，在为了德国与世界和平的利益，争取建立统一、独立、民主、爱好和平的德国的斗争中，在争取尽早缔结和约与撤退驻德占领军的斗争中，取得胜利。”
    苏联政府曾一再提出建议，主张与德国达成和平协议。八月二十三日的苏联照会的巨大重要性在于这个事实：它提供了和平地、公正地解决德国问题的实际可能性。
    大家都知道，美国、英国和法国极力规避与苏联政府就苏联提出的和约原则草案问题进行直接谈判。
    同时，它们正在用一切力量延续和加深德国的分裂，把西德和西方三国政府正在建立的西德军队拉进北大西洋集团，并更大规模地利用西德来进行这个集团的侵略活动。这一点由下述事实就可得到证明：西方国家已经和波恩政府缔结了单独“条约”和所谓“欧洲防务集团”“协定”。
    违反了德国人民的意志、强加于西德的波恩“条约”，是一个以侵略为目的的明目张胆的战争同盟。它使得德国军国主义的复活和由法西斯希特勒将领们指挥的西德雇佣军的组成合法化。同时，它无限期地延长了西方国家武装部队对西德的占领。
    根据波恩条约，美国、英国和法国政府所保留的“特权”给予它们以无限的可能性，使它们能够在西德领土上驻扎它们的军队、宣布紧急状态、掌握全权。西方国家获得了广泛地干预西德内政的权利，甚至获得了使用占领国家的武装部队来强迫西德服从它们的权利。
    还不仅于此，从波恩“条约”的原文来看，西方国家还想在一旦德国统一的时候，把它们已获得的“特权”保留起来并扩大到整个德国。
    有鉴于这些事实，美国、英国和法国政府对于四国保证在和约生效以前的时期内全德政府应有必要的行动自由这一点所表示的“关怀”的虚伪性质，也就十分明显了。
    西方国家提出的保证问题是与全德政府的权力问题有直接关系的。在这方面，苏联政府再次追述全德政府的权力问题已在波茨坦协定中得到了解决，波茨坦协定明文规定了建立一个和平、民主、独立、统一的德国所应该根据的原则。
    有必要指出：美国、英国和法国政府在西德的活动显然违反波茨坦协定的原则，它们曲解了苏联政府五月二十四日的照会中提到波茨坦会议的决定的意思。按照它们的说法，好像这个照会主张“恢复四国管制制度”。但是，事实上苏联政府五月二十四日的照会并没有提到恢复四国管制制度，而是说有必要遵守波茨坦协定中关于使德国重新成为一个统一、独立、和平、民主的国家的原则。
    苏联政府在八月二十三日的照会中，再度强调必须实行苏联的对德和约原则草案中所规定的原则，就是说德国有义务“不参加任何旨在反对任何一个曾以自己的军队参加对德作战的国家的集团或军事联盟”。
    很明显，这一条并没有阻止德国为了和平目的而和其他国家联合，但是它使德国再也没有可能参加北大西洋公约之类造成新世界大战危险的侵略集团。问题的这种提法，完全符合德国一切毗邻国家的利益，也符合德国自身的民族利益。
    苏联政府在它的照会中指出，西方国家认为在全德政府没有成立以前，不可能草拟对德和约，这种见解是完全站不住脚的。苏联的照会追述说，波茨坦协定授权外长会议准备对德和约，“此将于合乎目的之德国政府成立时，由德国政府予以接受”。
    美、英、法三个政府的态度不外是努力无限期地拖延对德和约问题的解决，使德国迟迟不能恢复统一，并借此使占领军无限期地留驻德国。
    由美、英、法三国政府的照会来看，西方国家避免整个地讨论德国问题，企图把事情简单地化为研究德国有无自由选举条件的调查团应怎样组成，具有什么职责和权限的问题。在这方面，美、英、法三国政府主张设立一个国际调查团。
    苏联政府的照会指出，建议成立国际调查团，对德国进行调查，就是把德国当作国际调查的对象，这只能认为是对德国民族的侮辱。这种要求一般是向落后国家提出的，不能对德国提出。苏联政府认为，经过四国的同意，由德国人自己选拔德国人组成的调查团——例如由德意志民主共和国人民议会及德意志联邦共和国众议院代表组成的调查团，是最客观的调查团。
    至于调查德国是否有条件举行自由选举的问题，苏联照会提出，“首先必须检查波茨坦会议一部分决定的执行情况，这些决定的执行，是举行真正自由的全德选举以及成立表示德国人民意志的全德政府的必要前提”。
    苏联照会指出，这一类决定之一便是波茨坦会议关于肃清德国军国主义的决定，以便如波茨坦协定所说，“永远防止德国军国主义和纳粹主义的复活和改组”，使“德国永远不再威胁其邻国和世界和平”。另一个这一类的决定就是实行波茨坦协议所宣布的对德政治原则，其中规定德国应该“摧毁国社党及其附属和监督的机构，解散一切纳粹组织，并确保此等机构不得以任何形式复活，所有纳粹军国主义的行动及宣传必须制止”。这些原则也包括波茨坦会议关于“准备使德国政治生活得于民主基础上获得重新建立，并使德国将来在国际生活上参与和平合作”的决定。
    西方国家建议，召开苏、美、英、法四国代表会议，仅仅讨论一个问题——调查德国有无举行自由选举条件的调查团应该如何组成，应该有怎样的职责，怎样的权限的问题。
    苏联政府在照会中指出，苏联和西方国家在这个问题上的来往照会，已使双方的见解多少比较接近了，因此，苏联政府愿意讨论西方国家所建议的问题，但是认为四国代表会议应该首先讨论对德和约及成立全德政府等重要问题。
    苏联政府建议，为讨论上述问题而召开的四国代表会议应该尽可能早日举行，无论如何不应迟于十月，苏联政府并认为会上应该一并讨论各国占领军撤离德国的日期的问题。苏联政府建议，会议在讨论上述问题时，邀请德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的代表参加。
    苏联政府的建议假如被接受，便意味着在按照欧洲及全世界和平与安全的利益和平解决德国问题方面迈进了一大步。
