    Three agricultural production cooperatives and eight mutual aid teams in seven villages, including Lusheng Village in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, under the guidance of the Hailun Technical Extension Station of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Northeast People's Government, used animal-drawn seeders to flat-sow 142 hectares of wheat (accounting for 75% of their total wheat area). These wheat fields yielded an average of 2,500 jin of wheat per hectare, double the yield of wheat sown by ordinary farmers using old plows. They used eleven animal-drawn harvesters to harvest the wheat, which was completed in just over four days, saving a total of more than 110 man-days. Therefore, the new farm implements were deeply loved by the local farmers.
    During the spring plowing season, these three agricultural production cooperatives and eight mutual aid teams used new-style farm implements to achieve deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and implemented a series of new technologies, such as seed selection, disinfection, and rational application of more manure. As a result, the seedlings grew tall, uniform, and particularly vigorous. The Wang Yongzhen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lusheng Village flat-sowed 23.05 hectares of wheat, of which 5 hectares were planted with the "Kehua" improved wheat variety, which is suitable for local growth, and the rest were "Da Qing Mang" wheat varieties propagated from last year's seed retention plots after individual plant selection. Before sowing, all seeds were sieved twice with a winnowing fan and disinfected with Wang Copper. Plenty of manure was applied to the land. During spring plowing, they used one double-wheeled single-furrow plow and one double-wheeled double-furrow plow, each pulled by eight horses to turn the soil, followed by harrowing with a spike-tooth harrow to level it. After sowing with the seeder, they immediately used a roller to compact the soil. When the wheat grew to more than three inches tall, they applied topdressing fertilizer (wood ash) at a rate of 1,500 jin per hectare to promote wheat growth. As a result, the wheat plants were strong, and the grains were plump. Each hectare yielded an average of five shi (equivalent to 2,500 jin), which was two shi (1,000 jin) more than the wheat planted by their neighbor Li Jingyun using old plows. Their three hectares of wheat, which were densely cross-sown with a seeder, grew to more than 3.5 chi tall, with an average of 24 grains per wheat ear and an average of more than 500 plants per square meter. According to preliminary estimates, each hectare could produce more than 4,500 jin. The four hectares of wheat flat-sown by the Cui Wanlu Agricultural Production Cooperative in the same village reached a height of 3.6 chi, with ears more than 3 cun long and an average of 25 grains per ear, which was more than 5 cun taller than the wheat of their neighbor Yu Qingjing, which was sown on the same day, with wheat ears 1 cun longer and an average of six to seven more grains per ear, yielding an additional six shi (3,000 jin) per hectare. The masses from surrounding villages who came to visit all recognized the benefits of cultivating with new farm implements, praising "New farm implements are truly treasures for crops."
    On July 31st, these three agricultural production cooperatives and eight production mutual aid teams used eleven rocker-arm harvesters to harvest the wheat. One harvester was pulled by four horses and operated by two people at the front, with eight people bundling and stacking at the back. Each day, they could harvest 4.5 to 5 hectares, which was much more efficient than harvesting wheat manually. As soon as the harvesters entered the field, they were surrounded by people who came to visit. More than 100 men, women, and children from Dongwu Village in Shuang'an Village ran behind the machines, watching and pondering. Some farmers, such as Ma Wancai of the Liu Fengcheng Mutual Aid Team in Dongwu Village, Shuang'an Village, initially thought that the harvester was not useful, saying, "This thing is awkward and clumsy, how can it be better than cutting with a sickle?"
    The harvester started harvesting. People heard a swishing sound as the wheat was cut down, neatly laid aside in bundles. Before long, a large pile was harvested. Watching the harvester cut so well and so quickly, Ma Wancai happily said, "New farm implements are better than old farm implements after all. Using a harvester to cut wheat is as neat and clean as getting a haircut. We must do a good job of organizing our team, and we will also use animal-drawn farm implements next year." Hou Dianjun, the new farm implement technician of the Mou Zhengang Mutual Aid Team, said, "In the past, we used small sickles to cut wheat all day long, and our arms and legs ached, and we still didn't cut much. Today, we can use new-style farm implements to cultivate the land, we must thank the Communist Party and the worker brothers."
    The labor-saving and efficient benefits of the harvester once again educated the farmers, shattered their conservative thinking, and improved their understanding of new farm implements, which also boosted the production enthusiasm of the masses. Many team leaders and members of mutual aid teams have stated that they must do a good job of organizing mutual aid teams and use new-style farm implements to cultivate the land next year.

### 黑龙江海伦县三个农业生产合作社和八个互助组  使用马拉新式农具并改进栽培技术  今年小麦比当地一般农民多收一倍

    黑龙江海伦县三个农业生产合作社和八个互助组
    使用马拉新式农具并改进栽培技术
    今年小麦比当地一般农民多收一倍
    黑龙江省海伦县禄生村等七个村庄的三个农业生产合作社和八个互助组，在东北人民政府农业部海伦技术推广站指导下，使用马拉播种机平播一百四十二垧小麦（占他们种麦全部面积的百分之七十五）。这些麦田平均每垧收获二千五百市斤小麦，比一般农民用旧犁种的小麦多收一倍。他们使用十一台马拉收割机割麦，四天多就割完了，一共节省了一百一十多个人工。因此，新农具得到当地农民群众的热爱。
    这三个农业生产合作社和八个互助组，在春耕时，使用新式农具，作到了深耕细作，并且实行了选种、消毒、合理地多施粪肥等一系列的新技术。因此，禾苗长得又高又齐，特别旺盛。禄生村王永珍农业生产合作社平播的二十三垧零五亩小麦，有五垧种的是适于当地生长的“克华”优良麦种，其余都是去年留种地繁殖的经过棵选的“大青芒”麦种。下种前，所有种籽都用风筛过两遍，又用王铜消了毒。地里都上满了粪。春耕时用双轮一铧犁和双轮双铧犁各一台，套八匹马在前面翻地，随着用钉齿钯钯平。用播种机下种后，紧接着就用镇压器压好。小麦长到三寸多高时，一垧地又施追肥（草木灰）一千五百市斤，促进了小麦的生长。因此，麦棵茁壮，籽粒肥大，每垧平均可收五石（合二千五百市斤），比地邻李景云用旧犁种的小麦，多收二石（一千市斤）。他们的三垧用播种机交叉密播的小麦，长有三尺五寸多高，每棵麦穗平均有二十四个粒，一平方公尺平均有五百多棵，据初步估计，每垧可产四千五百市斤以上。同村崔万禄农业生产合作社平播的四垧小麦，高达三尺六寸，穗长三寸多，每穗平均有二十五个粒，比同一天播种的地邻于庆井的小麦高五寸多，麦穗长出一寸，每穗平均多六到七个麦粒，一垧地可多收六石（三千市斤）。前来参观的周围各村群众都认识了用新农具耕种的好处，称赞“新农具真是庄稼宝”。
    这三个农业生产合作社和八个生产互助组，在七月三十一日，使用十一台摇臂式收割机收割小麦。一台收割机用四匹马两个人在前面收割，用八个人在后面捆、堆，每天能收割四垧半到五垧，比用人工割麦的效率高多了。收割机刚一下地，前来参观的人们就围满了。双安村东吴屯男女老少一百多人跟在机器后面跑，一边看一边琢磨。有的农民，如双安村东吴屯刘凤城互助组马万才最初还认为收割机不好使，“这家伙七棱八叉的，那能比镰刀割的好呢？”
    收割机开始收割了。人们听到一片刷刷的响声，小麦被割下来了，一铺子一铺子整齐地被撂在一旁。不大一会儿，就割了一大堆。马万才看着收割机割的又好又快，高兴地说：“还是新农具比旧农具好。用收割机割麦子，像剃头一样齐刷溜平。咱们把小组搞好，明年也使马拉农具。”牟振刚互助组新农具技手侯殿钧说：“过去咱们用小镰刀割一天麦子，累的胳膊腿酸疼，还割不出多少来。今天能使新式农具种地，要感谢共产党和工人老大哥。”
    收割机省工出活的好处又一次教育了农民，打破了他们的保守思想，提高了他们对新农具的认识，也鼓舞了群众的生产情绪。很多互助组的组长、组员都表示：一定要搞好互助组，明年使用新式农具种地。    （王锦威）
