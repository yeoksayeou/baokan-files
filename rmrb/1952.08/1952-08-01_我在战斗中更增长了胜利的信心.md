When we commemorate the "August 1st" Army Day, we first think of the glorious course of the People's Army's growth and strengthening in the revolutionary war under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The People's Liberation Army has grown from a small, poorly equipped force to a powerful and invincible force in the past twenty-five years. This heroic path has set a brilliant example for our young Volunteer Air Force. The young Volunteer Air Force carried forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army in combat and gradually grew in combat. We have learned to fight and have given and will continue to give the American aerial bandits heavier blows.

Before participating in the war, we were unfamiliar with aerial combat. And we were facing the American Air Force, which was known as "powerful." But our young air force fighters have the courage and determination to defeat it. The Party has repeatedly educated us that the fundamental reason for our victory lies in the justice of the war we are engaged in; although the enemy appears to be strong, their morale is low, and therefore they are on a downward path. The people support us, donating planes and cannons, and sending letters of condolences and gifts; these are all filled with the infinite hearts of the people of the motherland. The people of the motherland expect us to severely strike the American aerial bandits and defend the people's peaceful and happy lives. The Party and the people educate us to love the motherland and love peace; the Party and the people educate us to hate the enemy who destroys peaceful and happy lives. The Party and the people give us infinite strength to fight bravely.

However, courage and determination alone are not enough. The Party teaches us that we must combine bravery, technology, and tactics to achieve victory. On this issue, I would like to talk about my own experience.

The first time I fought, I was still in the dark about aerial combat and the enemy. But the desire to avenge the Korean people made me determined to shoot down enemy planes no matter what – even if it was just one. When I first discovered an enemy plane, a feeling of joy and tension suddenly occupied me. The joy was that since I had encountered it, I had to firmly grasp it, defeat it, and not let it escape or bite me in return. At the same time, because I had not experienced aerial combat, I always felt that the enemy was full of firepower and would shoot at me everywhere, and the whole sky seemed to be full of enemy planes. I had courage, but I did not shoot down the enemy plane.

When I flew back to the base, through combat reviews, I realized that the reason I did not shoot down the enemy plane that day was because I only relied on my courage to rush towards the enemy plane in combat, and did not use tactics, pay attention to using technology, and effectively strike the enemy plane. After encountering the enemy plane, I was not calm enough, and I could not calmly, ingeniously, and quickly consider how to deal with it. Although this battle did not shoot down an enemy plane, it gave me a great lesson.

In another battle, I shot down and damaged one enemy plane each. In this battle, I was not as reckless as last time, and I used tactics more calmly. I calmly and boldly approached the enemy plane, and before firing, I paid attention to aiming, and as a result, I shot down the enemy plane. In this battle, I implemented the basic tactical movements. These basic tactical movements paved the way for us to learn more complex and advanced tactical principles.

We are advancing in the flames of war. The Party leads us to summarize combat experience in the tense combat intervals, and learn from the combat experience of fraternal units, so that we can improve ourselves in combat. Each battle gives us new experiences, and in the process of reviewing and overcoming shortcomings, we take another step forward. After that, I had a higher hit rate, for example, I shot down three enemy planes in one battle.

In such a process of progress, our young Volunteer Air Force has grown up. Combat will train us to be more courageous and more resourceful. We firmly believe that in the past, the People's Liberation Army used inferior weapons to defeat the enemy on land. In the future, we will develop into a strong modern national defense force, and we will surely be able to crush the aggression of American imperialism and victoriously shoulder the great mission of defending the motherland and defending world peace. We have already taught and struck the American aerial aggressors in the first battle, and we will achieve greater victories in the future.

### 我在战斗中更增长了胜利的信心

    我在战斗中更增长了胜利的信心
    志愿军空军英雄  刘玉堤
    当我们纪念“八一”建军节的时候，首先想到的是在毛主席、朱总司令领导下的人民军队在革命战争里成长壮大的光荣历程。人民解放军二十五年来从一支人数很少、装备简陋的队伍，发展成为强大的不可战胜的力量，这一英雄道路，为我们年青的志愿军空军树立了光辉的榜样。年青的志愿军空军在战斗中发扬了人民解放军的光荣传统，在战斗中逐渐成长起来。我们已经学会了打仗，给予了并要继续给予美国空中强盗以更沉重的打击。
    在参战以前，我们对空战是不熟悉的。而我们面对着的，是号称“强大”的美国空军。但是我们年青的空军战士们都有勇气和决心战胜它。党屡屡教育我们，我们能胜利的根本原因是在于我们所从事的战争的正义性；敌人虽然貌似强大，但是士气低落，因而走的是下坡路。人民支援着我们，捐献了飞机大炮，送来了一封封的慰问信和一件件的慰问品；这些都充满了祖国人民无限的心意。祖国人民期望我们狠狠地打击美国空中强盗，保卫人民的和平幸福生活。党和人民教育我们热爱祖国、热爱和平；党和人民教育我们仇恨破坏和平幸福生活的敌人。党和人民使我们获得无限的力量去英勇战斗。
    然而，只凭勇气和决心是不够的。党教育我们要将勇敢、技术和战术结合起来，才能得到胜利。在这个问题上，我愿意说说我自己的经历。
    我第一次战斗时，对空战、对敌人都还摸不着底。但是为朝鲜人民复仇的意念，使我决心无论如何也要打下敌机——那怕只是一架也好。当我在第一次发现了敌机的时候，一种喜悦和紧张的心情顿时占据了我。喜悦的是，既然遇到了，就要紧紧地抓住它，战胜它，不让它逃跑或者反过来咬住我。同时，由于还没有经历过空战，总觉得敌人周身都有火力，随处都会向我射击，而整个的天空又像是到处都有敌机似的。我有勇气，但是却没有打下敌人的飞机来。
    当我飞回基地以后，通过战斗讲评，我发觉这天我没有打下敌机是由于我在战斗中只凭着自己的勇敢冲向敌机，而没有运用战术，注意发挥技术，有效地打击敌机，遇到敌机以后不够沉着，不能镇定、机智、敏捷地考虑如何对付它。这次战斗，虽没有打下敌机，但却给了我很大的教训。
    在另一次战斗中我打落、打伤敌机各一架。在这次战斗中，我已不像上次那样猛打猛冲了，我比较沉着地运用了战术。我沉着大胆地接近了敌机，在开炮以前，注意瞄准，结果打下了敌机。在这次战斗中我贯彻了基本的战术动作。这些基本的战术动作就为我们学习较复杂、较高级的战术原则开辟了道路。
    我们在战火中前进着。党在紧张的战斗间隙中，领导我们总结战斗经验，并学习兄弟部队的战斗经验，使我们在战斗中提高自己。每一次战斗，都使我们有新的体会，在检讨和克服缺点的过程中，又使我们向前跨进了一步。这以后我就有了较高的命中率，例如在一次战斗中就打下了三架敌机。
    在这样的进步历程中，我们年青的志愿军空军成长起来了。战斗要将我们锻炼得更加勇敢、更加机智。我们深信：过去，人民解放军使用劣势武器在陆地上战胜了敌人，今后我们将发展成为一支强大的现代化国防军，我们一定能粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，胜利地担负起保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的重大使命。我们在初战中已经给美国空中侵略者以教训和打击，今后将取得更大的胜利。
