    The Superiority and Characteristics of China's 1952 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget
    Ma Yinchu
    The 1952 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget of the People's Republic of China has been approved by the 16th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on the 6th of this month. According to Minister Bo Yibo's explanation, the basic principle for compiling this budget is: to continue to consolidate national defense, stabilize prices, and carry out comprehensive restoration and focused construction. The total revenue and total expenditure of this budget have reached complete balance during the compilation process. Minister Bo said: This is the most favorable situation that our country has seen under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao since the founding of the Central People's Government. How elated and encouraged will our people be upon hearing this news! We will redouble our efforts, give full play to our initiative and creativity to ensure the victorious completion of the new budget tasks, and celebrate Chairman Mao's correct, great, and glorious leadership!
    (I) Superiority
    The superiority of this budget lies in its ability to comprehensively achieve the tasks of "consolidating national defense," "focusing on construction," "comprehensively restoring," and "stabilizing prices." This is impossible in capitalist countries.
    We all know that in countries with capitalist economic systems (including their affiliated countries and colonies), prices are governed by the spontaneous law of supply and demand, and the government cannot control them. On the one hand, they launch aggressive wars and expand war economies; on the other hand, they want to stabilize order and prices. This is a sharp contradiction, and it is impossible to completely achieve all four goals. Because they want to step up arms production and launch aggressive wars, they must increase a large amount of funding. There are only three sources of funding: 1. increasing taxes; 2. issuing banknotes; 3. raising public debt. Increasing taxes will inevitably reduce the people's purchasing power and reduce the demand for civilian goods, and the prices of these goods will inevitably fall. If banknotes are issued and the currency is inflated, prices will inevitably rise. Furthermore, if public debt is issued, unless people use savings to purchase public debt, which does not affect prices, if people save on consumption to purchase public debt, the impact on prices will be the same as increasing taxes; if public debt is pledged to the national bank, the impact on prices will be the same as inflating the currency. Today, the people of imperialist countries have suffered losses from repeated wars, and where can they find savings to subscribe to public debt! Therefore, their prices will not be stable. It will either fall or rise. Whether it rises or falls, it is the result of reducing people's purchasing power. As a result, civilian industries collapse, unemployed workers increase, and an economic crisis follows. How can order be stabilized! If prices are limited, the war economy cannot be expanded. Therefore, they cannot comprehensively achieve these four goals. The result is economic collapse. We need not go far. The three fascist countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, during World War II were like this. American imperialism supported the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to launch a civil war, and it also suffered the same fate. Today, American imperialism is still obsessed and insists on its own way, launching a war of aggression against Korea. Can it escape this fate? It is estimated that the tax burden of each adult male in the United States has increased from $151 in 1929 to $860 in 1951, but the budget deficit is getting bigger year by year. According to the US Treasury Department's announcement in March, in the first eight months of the 1951-1952 fiscal year, the shortfall between revenue and expenditure reached more than 7.5 billion US dollars; the budget deficit for the 1952-1953 fiscal year will reach 14.4 billion US dollars. In the total expenditure of 85.4 billion US dollars in the 1952-1953 fiscal year budget, military expenses accounted for 88.8%, while other administrative, educational, health, and other non-military expenses were only 11.2%, of which education expenses were less than 1% of the total expenditure. So, the tax burden is increasing, inflation is rising, prices are soaring, the standard of living continues to decline, unemployment is increasing, and people are panicking. Isn't this a path to suicide?
    Socialist economic system countries, including countries in the transition to the New Democracy, can comprehensively achieve the tasks of consolidating national defense, focusing on construction, comprehensively restoring, and stabilizing prices. Because the law of value we use is a transformed law of value, a law governed by economic planning, we can achieve price stability under the requirements of focusing on construction, consolidating national defense, and comprehensively restoring; moreover, price stability is a necessary condition for consolidating national defense, focusing on construction, and comprehensively restoring. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union in implementing the New Economic Policy shortly after the founding of the country shines brightly upon us. After the unified financial and economic work began in China at the end of March 1950, national prices quickly tended to stabilize. For more than two years, under the conditions of stable prices, consolidating national defense and focusing on construction have been victoriously advancing. According to statistics, if the wholesale price index of six major cities, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an, is 100 in January and February 1950, it will be 113 in January and February 1951. It only increased by 13% in one year. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, prices have been comprehensively stabilized for more than half a year. Isn't this a sharp contrast with the United States? Chairman Mao taught us in his opening speech at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "All facts prove that our people's democratic dictatorship system has great superiority over the political system of capitalist countries. On the basis of this system, the Chinese people can exert their inexhaustible strength. This strength cannot be defeated by any enemy." Our budget this year is also a clear proof of this superiority.
    (II) Characteristics
    The main characteristics of our budget this time are as follows:
    1. Complete Balance of Revenue and Expenditure
    The principle of fiscal revenue and expenditure is balance. A deficit budget is certainly not good, and too much income surplus is not a very healthy finance either, because this will not allow all the money to be used where it is most useful. When we compiled the 1951 national budget, we could only say that it was close to balance, and we could only say that prices were basically stable. The financial and economic situation has fundamentally changed this year. Fiscal revenue and expenditure are completely balanced, and prices are completely stable. This complete balance and stability have already been achieved in the process of implementing the 1951 budget. This is not only unprecedented during the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's rule, but also an unprecedented phenomenon in Chinese history. Moreover, the property returned to the state by the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements has not yet been included, which proves the abundance of national finance today.
    2. Construction Moving Towards Peace
    In the total expenditure of imperialist countries, military expenses must account for at least 50%. This is the case for Britain in recent years; France accounts for 59%; the United States accounts for nearly 90%, as mentioned above. This is a reflection of the essence of the imperialist war economy and its aggressive policy. The situation in peaceful and democratic countries is completely different. The Soviet Union's expenditure on national defense during the Great Patriotic War, such as in 1945, was only 45% of the annual expenditure; the national defense expenditure in the 1952 budget was reduced to 23.9%. This is also a reflection of the essence of a peaceful economy. Because China's economic foundation is relatively weak and it is in a situation of strengthening national defense construction, national defense expenditure ranked first and economic construction ranked second in the 1951 budget. This has already changed in the 1952 budget. Construction (including economic, cultural, and educational) has risen to the first place, accounting for more than 50% of the total expenditure; national defense expenditure has fallen to the second place. This shows that China's economy is also moving towards peace in great strides.
    3. Growth of Socialist Economic Components
    In the 1950 national fiscal revenue, urban tax ranked first, agricultural tax ranked second, and the profit income of state-owned enterprises ranked third. In 1951, although urban tax revenue still ranked first, the proportion was relatively reduced; the profit and depreciation contributions of state-owned enterprises rose to the second place, and the absolute number increased even more; agricultural tax fell to the third place. This year, the profits and depreciation contributions of central and local state-owned enterprises increased by 89.83% compared with 1951. If the profits of local state-owned enterprises included in the national budget are excluded, the actual increase in profits of state-owned enterprises this year is 88.5%. "The state-owned economy is an economy of a socialist nature... It is the main material basis for the development of production and economic prosperity of the People's Republic and the leading force of the entire social economy" (Article 28 of the Common Program). Today, the rapid rise in the profit and depreciation contributions of state-owned enterprises is an indicator of the rapid growth of socialist economic components.
    4. The Foundation of the Worker-Peasant Alliance is Growing Stronger
    During the rule of the reactionary government, the burden on farmers was extremely heavy. Mencius said about the living conditions of farmers in feudal society: "In good years, they suffer all their lives; in bad years, they cannot avoid death." The lives of farmers in semi-feudal and semi-colonial society were even worse. By the time of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's rule, the poverty of farmers had reached its extreme. In addition to paying money and labor, they also had to pay with their lives. However, the Chinese farmers after liberation were given land and their lives were greatly improved. After the national liberation, the burden on farmers was reduced year by year. In 1952, China's agricultural tax revenue has fallen to the fourth place, accounting for 12% of the total revenue, and the local surcharges will be merged into the regular tax for collection. In this way, the burden on farmers in 1952 will be much less than in 1951. With the basic completion of land reform on a national scale, the burden on farmers will be further reduced, and the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance will be increasingly consolidated.
    5. Amazing Development of Culture and Education
    Cultural and educational construction is also an element of peaceful construction. In 1952, the increase in cultural and educational expenditure was particularly large, increasing by 184.83% compared with 1951. In order to cultivate talents for national construction, starting in the second half of the year, all students in national universities, secondary technical schools, normal schools, and workers' and peasants' quick-course middle schools will be given people's grants, and the grants for ordinary middle schools will also be increased compared with 1951. Due to the development of cultural and educational undertakings, the number of primary school students nationwide will increase from more than 43 million to 49 million, the number of middle school students will increase from more than 2 million to 3 million, and the number of university students will increase from 170,000 to 210,000. All staff members of people's governments at all levels, political parties, groups, and affiliated institutions will implement public medical care. The starvation and persecution suffered by young people under the reactionary government before liberation, and the hardship of teachers and civil servants who were struggling to make ends meet and were not secure in their livelihood, have long gone and will never return. How happy are the young people and public officials born in the era of Mao Zedong! How bright is the future!
    Our financial and economic situation has improved so rapidly because of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, which has enabled various material constructions to advance in a planned and step-by-step manner. And more importantly, in recent years, under the call and leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country have universally carried out ideological transformation, constantly improving the political awareness of everyone, and with the attitude of masters, they love the motherland, love the leader, and are strongly united, moving towards the same goal, so they can give full play to unparalleled initiative and creativity, and promote the rapid development of national construction. Labor models in the Jingjiang flood diversion project, who carried more than 20,000 catties of mud every day and traveled 130 li of road. The creation of Qi Jianhua's quick literacy method, as well as other thousands of labor models and combat heroes, and thousands of creations and inventions, are only possible under such circumstances. The endlessness of mass strength is based on this. Marx said: "Theory, once it grasps the masses, immediately becomes a material force." Therefore, the victory of our budget today is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    我国一九五二年度国家财政收支预算的优越性和特点
    马寅初
    中华人民共和国一九五二年度国家财政收支预算，已经本月六日中央人民政府委员会第十六次会议通过了。据薄一波部长的说明，编制这个预算的基本方针是：继续巩固国防、稳定物价、并进行全面恢复和重点建设。这个预算的总收入及总支出在编制时已经达到完全平衡，薄部长说：这是中央人民政府成立以来我们国家在毛主席的英明领导下所出现的最有利的情况。我们全国人民听到这个消息，将如何的欢欣鼓舞，加紧努力，发挥自己的积极性与创造性来保证新预算任务的胜利完成，庆祝毛主席的正确、伟大和光荣的领导！
    （一）优越性
    这个预算的优越性就在于它能将“巩固国防”、“重点建设”、“全面恢复”和“稳定物价”这十六个字的任务能够全面做到。这在资本主义国家是不可能的。
    我们都知道，在资本主义经济体系国家（包括它们的附属国和殖民地）的物价，是受自发的供求律所支配，政府是无法控制的。它们一面发动侵略战争、扩大备战经济，一面又要安定秩序、稳定物价。这是一个尖锐的矛盾，将四件事完全做到是不可能的。因为他们要加紧军火生产，发动侵略战争，就必须增加大量的经费。经费来源不外三种：一、增税；二、发行钞票；三、募集公债。增税的结果，必定要减少人民的购买力，减少民用物资的需要，这些物品的价格必然要跌落。若发行钞票，膨胀通货，结果物价必定高涨。再若发行公债，除人民使用储蓄购买公债不影响物价外，如由人民节约消费来购买，其影响物价将与增税相同；如以公债向国家银行押借，则其影响物价将与膨胀通货相同。现在帝国主义国家的人民因遭受迭次大战的损失，那里还有储蓄可以应募公债！所以他们的物价是不会稳定的。不是跌，就是涨。无论涨与跌，都是减少人民购买力的结果。于是民用工业倒闭，失业工人增加，随之而来的是经济危机。秩序又那里能安定！如果限定物价，战争经济就无法扩展。所以他们对这四件事是不可能全面做到的。其结果是招致经济的崩溃。远的不必说，第二次世界大战中德、意、日三个法西斯国家就是这样的。美帝国主义扶持蒋匪帮发动内战，也遭到同样的命运。今天美帝国主义还执迷不悟，一意孤行，发动侵朝战争，能够逃出这个命运么？据估计，美国每个成年男子每年的税收负担，已从一九二九年的一百五十一美元，增加到一九五一年的八百六十美元，但预算的亏空还是一年大一年。据美国财政部三月间宣布，一九五一到一九五二会计年度头八个月中，收支不敷已达七十五亿多美元；一九五二到一九五三会计年度预算的亏空，将达一百四十四亿美元。在一九五二到一九五三会计年度预算八百五十四亿美元全部开支中，军事费用就占百分之八十八·八，其他行政、教育、卫生等非军事开支不过百分之十一·二了，其中教育费不到全部开支的百分之一。所以税额增重、通货膨胀、物价高涨、生活水准继续下降、失业增加、人心惶惶，这还不是自杀的道路么？
    社会主义经济体系的国家，包括过渡期的新民主主义的国家，对于巩固国防、重点建设、全面恢复和稳定物价这十六个字的任务，能够全面做到。因为我们运用的价值律是改造过了的价值律，受经济计划支配的规律，所以在重点建设、巩固国防、全面恢复的要求下，可以做到物价稳定；并且物价稳定，更是巩固国防、重点建设和全面恢复的必要条件。苏联在建国后不久实行新经济政策的先进经验，光辉的照耀着我们。我国一九五○年三月底统一财经工作展开后，全国物价即迅速的趋于稳定。两年多来，在物价稳定的条件之下，巩固国防和重点建设更着着的胜利前进。据统计，上海、天津、汉口、广州、重庆、西安六个大都市的批发物价指数，如以一九五○年一、二月为一○○，则一九五一年一、二月为一一三。一年间只增加百分之十三。“三反”、“五反”运动以后，半年余来，物价已全面的稳定了。这与美国不是成一个鲜明的对比么？毛主席在中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议上的开会词中教导我们：“一切事实都证明：我们的人民民主专政的制度，较之资本主义国家的政治制度具有极大的优越性。在这种制度的基础上，我国人民能够发挥其无穷无尽的力量。这种力量，是任何敌人所不能战胜的。”我们今年的预算，也正是优越性的一个明证。
    （二）特    点
    我们这次预算的几个特点，主要的有如下述：
    一、收支完全平衡
    财政收支以平衡为原则。赤字预算固然不好，收入剩余过多也不是很健全的财政，因为这将不能使所有的钱用到最有用的地方去。我们编造一九五一年度国家预算时，只能说接近平衡，对于物价也只能说基本稳定。今年财经情况根本改观了，财政收支既完全平衡，物价亦完全稳定。这种完全平衡与稳定，且在执行一九五一年度预算过程中就已经达到了。这不仅是蒋匪帮统治时期所没有过的，也是中国历史上所没有过的现象。而且“三反”“五反”运动所归还国家的财产，还未计算在内，足证今天国家财政的丰裕了。
    二、建设走向和平
    帝国主义国家的财政全部开支中，军事费用至少要占百分之五十，近年英国就是如此；法国占百分之五十九；美国则将近百分之九十，已如上述。这是帝国主义战争经济本质及其侵略政策的反映。和平民主国家情况就完全不同，苏联在卫国战争期间用于国防的支出，如一九四五年也不过占岁出的百分之四十五；一九五二年的预算，国防支出就降到百分之二十三·九了。这又是和平经济本质的反映。我国因经济基础比较薄弱，又处在加强国防建设的情况下，一九五一年度的预算还是国防支出占第一位，经济建设居第二位。一九五二年度预算中则已经易位了，建设（包括经济与文教）已上升到第一位，且占全部支出百分之五十以上；国防支出则降到第二位。足见我国的经济亦是大踏步的走向和平。
    三、社会主义经济成分的增长
    一九五○年国家财政收入中，城市税占第一位、农业税占第二位，国营企业利润收入占第三位。一九五一年城市税收虽仍居第一位，但比例相对减少；国营企业利润及折旧提缴则上升到第二位，其绝对数字增加更大；农业税则降居第三位。今年中央和地方国营企业利润及折旧提缴比一九五一年增加百分之八十九·八三。如将列入全国预算的地方国营企业利润除外，今年国营企业利润实增百分之八十八·五。“国营经济为社会主义性质的经济。……为人民共和国发展生产、繁荣经济的主要物质基础和整个社会经济的领导力量”（共同纲领第二十八条）。今天国营企业利润及折旧提缴收入迅速上升，是社会主义经济成分迅速成长的指标。
    四、工农联盟的基础日益巩固
    反动政府统治时代，农民负担是极其苛重的。孟子就说过封建社会里农民的生活状况：“乐岁终身苦，凶年不免于死亡。”半封建半殖民地社会的农民生活更要恶劣，到蒋匪帮统治时期，农民的穷困已经到了极点，出钱、出力之外，还要出命。可是解放后的中国农民，分田分地，生活大大改善了。全国解放以后，农民的负担又逐年降低。一九五二年我国的农业税收入已降到第四位，占总收入的百分之十二，并将地方附加并入正税一道征收。这样一九五二年农民负担将比一九五一年减少许多。在全国范围的土地改革基本完成后，农民负担又减轻，工农联盟的基础必日益巩固。
    五、文化教育的惊人发展
    文教建设亦是和平建设的要素。一九五二年文教支出增加尤多，比一九五一年增加百分之一百八十四·八三。为培植国家建设人才，下半年起，全国高等学校、中等技术学校、师范学校、工农速成中学的学生全部发给人民助学金，普通中学的助学金亦较一九五一年增加。由于文教事业的发展，全国小学生将自四千三百余万增到四千九百万，中学生将自二百余万增到三百万，高等学校学生将自十七万增到二十一万。各级人民政府、党派、团体及所属事业机关的所有工作人员实行公费医疗。解放前反动政府统治下的青年所受饥饿和迫害的情况，公教人员捉襟见肘、朝不保夕的苦难，早已一去不复返了。生在毛泽东时代的青年和公职人员是多么的幸福呵！前途又是多么的光明呵！
    我们的财政经济情况能够这样的迅速好转，是由于毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导，使各项物质建设能有计划有步骤的前进。而尤其重要的，还是几年来全国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的号召和领导下，普遍进行着思想改造，使人人的政治认识水平不断提高，以主人翁的态度，热爱祖国，热爱领袖，坚强团结，朝着同一目标前进，故能发挥无比的积极性与创造性，推动国家建设事业迅速发展。像荆江分洪工程中的劳动模范，每日挑二万多斤泥，行走一百三十里路程。像祁建华的速成识字法的创造，以及其他成千成万的劳动模范与战斗英雄，和成千成万的创造发明，只有在这种情况下，才有涌现的可能。群众力量的无穷无尽，根据在此。马克思说：“理论一掌握了群众，便立刻成为物质的力量。”所以我们今天预算的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
