Anhui Qingyang County Wang Tongshun Mutual Aid Group
Devises a Good Method for Calculating Work Points for Oxen

Editor: The Wang Tongshun Mutual Aid Group in Wuting Village, Qingyang County, has a total of seven oxen. During this year's spring plowing, the group implemented a method of using oxen equally, stipulating that each ox would be credited with work points for plowing thirteen mu of land, and the rent for each mu of ox would be calculated at thirty jin of rice. At that time, everyone thought this was a good way to calculate. After doing it for a while, they discovered that this method was completely inconsistent with the principle of equivalent exchange. Group member Wang Yunqi's ox was strong and sturdy. In the past, after plowing his own fourteen mu of land, he could also help others plow nine mu. Now, if each ox is calculated uniformly at thirteen mu, he would not only not receive ox rent, but also have to pay ox rent for one mu of land. Group member Zhang Xiangui's small ox couldn't even plow his own ten mu and seven fen of land. After implementing this method, he would not only not pay ox rent, but also receive ox rent for more than two mu of land. How unreasonable this is! Later, everyone came up with a new method. First, they stipulated the number of labor days required for each mu of land according to different soil qualities, and then evaluated the work points for each ox according to the ox's age and strength. For example, a six-tooth strong ox would be rated at twelve work points, an eight-tooth or six-tooth weaker ox would be rated at ten work points, and a four-tooth ox would be rated at seven to eight work points, and so on. Each ox work point is priced at one and a half human labor points. This is more reasonable. When using oxen, the number of oxen is determined according to the size of the field. If the field is large, several oxen are used together for plowing. Everyone feels that this method is very good, and I am introducing it here for reference by mutual aid groups in various places.

    安徽青阳县汪同顺互助组
    订出耕牛计工的好办法
    编辑同志：青阳县五亭村汪同顺互助组共有七头耕牛。今年春耕时，组内实行平均使用耕牛的办法，规定每头牛按耕田十三亩计工，每亩牛租按三十斤稻谷计算。当时大家认为这样办好算账。作了不久，他们发现这个做法完全不合等价交换的原则。组员王云起的牛身强力壮，过去耕完他自己的十四亩田，还可帮助别人耕九亩；如今每头牛一律以十三亩计算，他不仅得不到牛租，还要拿出一亩地的牛租；组员张先贵的小牛，连他自己的十亩零七分地都耕不过来；实行这种办法以后，他不仅不付出牛租，还要拿进二亩多地的牛租。这是多么不合理的事！后来大家想出了个新办法，首先是按照不同的土质，规定每亩地需要牛工的工数，再按照牛的年龄和强弱，评定每头牛的工分。如六牙强力牛评十二分工，八牙或六牙次力牛评十分工，四牙牛评七分到八分工，等等。每个牛工按一个半人工记价。这就比较合理了。使用耕牛时，按照田亩大小，决定耕牛头数，田亩大，就用几条牛在一起耕。大家都感到这个办法很好，特介绍出来供各地互助组参考。　濮星垣
