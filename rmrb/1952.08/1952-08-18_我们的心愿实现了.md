    Our Wish Has Come True
    Comrade Editor: As the motherland is about to launch large-scale economic construction, we are graduating. Since the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, we have been determined: "Always be ready to respond to the call of the motherland." Today is the time to realize our wish.
    Recalling the dark era under the rule of the reactionaries, the people of the motherland suffered all kinds of disasters, and our enthusiasm and wisdom were ruthlessly suppressed. Today, the people of the motherland have stood up, and we young students no longer have to worry about studying and working. We only have one thing in our hearts: to defend and build the motherland and strive for greater happiness for the people.
    Today, the motherland is leaping forward, and brilliant victories have been achieved time and time again on various production fronts. In agriculture, due to the victorious completion of land reform in most areas, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved. In addition, with the construction of water conservancy and the improvement of agricultural production technology, the peasants are generally organized, which has greatly increased the yield per unit area. At present, agricultural production cooperatives are developing rapidly, and collective farms have appeared in the Northeast and Xinjiang. The beautiful and happy tomorrow of the motherland is right in front of us.
    When we think of these things, we feel incomparably excited and full of strength. We know that to create a happier tomorrow, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, study our professional work, and learn from the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union with an open mind. We believe that the wisdom and labor of the people of the motherland will surely turn the desert into fertile fields and turn barren mountains and remote areas into farms and cities. We must infinitely increase the output of agricultural production, realize agricultural collectivization and mechanization, and strive for the happy life of the people. All the graduating students of Beijing Agricultural University resolutely and happily obey the unified distribution of the motherland and strive to go to the work posts where the motherland needs us most.
    All graduating students of Beijing Agricultural University, 1952

### 我们的心愿实现了

    我们的心愿实现了
    编辑同志：在祖国即将展开大规模经济建设的时候，我们毕业了。从抗美援朝运动开始，我们就下定决心：“时刻准备着响应祖国的号召”，今天是实现我们的心愿的时候了。
    回想在反动派统治的黑暗时代里，祖国人民遭受着种种的灾难，我们的热情与智慧被无情地压抑着。今天祖国人民已经站起来了，我们青年学生再也不为学习和工作发愁了，我们心里只有一件事：保卫和建设祖国，争取人民更大的幸福。
    今天祖国在飞跃地前进，各个生产战线上都一次又一次地取得了辉煌的胜利。在农业上，由于绝大部分地区土地改革的胜利完成，农民的生产热情大大地提高了，加以水利的兴修，农业生产技术的提高，农民普遍地组织起来，使单位面积产量有了很大的提高。目前农业生产合作社在迅速地发展，集体农庄在东北和新疆出现了，祖国美好幸福的明天就在眼前了。
    当我们一想到这些，心中就感到无比的兴奋，全身充满了力量。我们知道要创造更幸福的明天，就必须在共产党和毛主席的领导下，加强马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的学习，钻研业务，虚心学习苏联的先进生产经验。我们相信祖国人民的智慧和劳动，一定会使沙漠变成良田，使荒山僻野变成农庄和城市。我们要使农业生产的产量无限地提高，实现农业集体化、机械化，为人民幸福的生活而奋斗。我们北京农业大学全体毕业同学，坚决地愉快地服从祖国的统一分配，争取到祖国最需要我们去的工作岗位上去。
    北京农业大学一九五二年全体毕业同学
