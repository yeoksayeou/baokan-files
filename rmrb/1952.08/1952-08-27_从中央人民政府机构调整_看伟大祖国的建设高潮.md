    Seeing the Construction Upsurge of the Great Motherland from the Organizational Adjustment of the Central People's Government

    To the Editor: I read with great excitement the "Resolution on Adjusting the Organizations of the Central People's Government" published in the People's Daily on August 11, especially the item about "establishing the Central People's Government First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Central People's Government Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Central People's Government Ministry of Construction Engineering, and the Central People's Government Ministry of Geology." It allows us to see that the construction upsurge of the great motherland is coming soon. We know that if we want to eliminate the poverty and backwardness left over from old China, and if we want to transform an agricultural country into an industrial country, we must first develop heavy industry. To develop heavy industry, we must establish a strong machine manufacturing industry, because it is the key to technological improvement in economic sectors. In addition, we must strengthen the exploration and exploitation of underground resources. Steel and coal are the foundation of national industrial development, so the establishment of the Ministry of Geology is necessary. I believe that this adjustment of the Central People's Government's organizations is not just a matter of adding a few organizations, but rather it demonstrates that the new China will soon become more prosperous and strong. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, a strong industrialized China is about to appear. Every one of us young people should intensify our studies, constantly transform ourselves, and improve our work abilities in order to dedicate ourselves to the construction cause of the motherland!

    从中央人民政府机构调整
    看伟大祖国的建设高潮
    编辑同志：我以极大的兴奋阅读了八月十一日人民日报刊载的“关于调整中央人民政府机构的决议”，特别是关于“成立中央人民政府第一机械工业部、中央人民政府第二机械工业部、中央人民政府建筑工程部、中央人民政府地质部”一项。它使我们看到伟大祖国的建设高潮快要来了。我们知道，要想消灭旧中国所遗留下来的贫困和落后，要想把农业国变成工业国，首先要发展重工业，发展重工业，又必须建立强大的机械制造业，因为它是经济部门技术改进的关键。另外，我们还要加强对地下资源的探索和开采。钢铁、煤炭是国家工业发展的基础，所以地质部的建立是必要的。我认为，这次中央人民政府机构的调整，不仅是几个机构的添设问题，而是说明着新中国即将更加繁荣富强起来。在共产党的领导下，一个强大的工业化的中国将要出现了。我们每个青年都应当加紧学习，不断地改造自己，提高工作能力，以献身于祖国的建设事业！叶　丹
