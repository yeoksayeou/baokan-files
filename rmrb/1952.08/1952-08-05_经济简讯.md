Henan, Hubei, and Guangdong Provinces Launch Summer Grain Collection Work

The summer agricultural tax collection work in Henan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces has been fully launched, and most areas are busy delivering grain to warehouses. Most areas of Henan Province completed the land survey and production determination work last year. This year, the province implemented the policy of "taxation according to rate, and legal tax reduction and exemption," which has greatly promoted the stabilization and encouragement of farmers' production enthusiasm and the rapid completion of the public grain collection task. In Jingzhou and Huanggang Special Districts of Hubei Province and Hainan Administrative Region, the summer grain has been completely stored in warehouses. The land survey and production determination work in these areas will be carried out on a large scale in August, September, and October to prepare for the autumn grain collection.

After Criticizing Capitalist Ideology, the Lingbi County Cooperative in Northern Anhui has Developed its Cooperative Affairs and Business

Since the great project of harnessing the Huai River has been carried out in Lingbi County for two years, a bumper harvest has been achieved, and farmers urgently need more agricultural tools. However, the Lingbi County Cooperative has a purely profit-oriented capitalist viewpoint and neglects the supply of means of production. Before April of this year, agricultural tools and other means of production accounted for only a quarter of the cooperative's supply and marketing goods; even this small amount of means of production was of poor quality.

After the "Three-Anti" movement began, the capitalist ideology existing within the cooperative was criticized. Now, most of the goods operated by the county's cooperative are means of production urgently needed by farmers. From the beginning of April to the end of June, cooperatives at all levels in the county sold more than 125,000 pieces of agricultural tools, worth 719 million yuan, reducing intermediary exploitation for cooperative members by about 224 million yuan. In addition, it sold more than 79,000 pieces of agricultural tools, cotton seeds, tobacco leaves, vermicelli, etc., totaling more than 20 million jin, on behalf of cooperative members and general handicraftsmen. Therefore, cooperative members have shifted from dissatisfaction with the cooperative to caring about the cooperative, and non-members have also requested to join the cooperative one after another.

The Huaibei Salt Field Promotes the Collective Production Method of the Shi Baoyu Group, Improving Salt Workers' Labor Productivity and Salt Quality

After the state-owned Huaibei Salt Field in Northern Jiangsu Province universally promoted the collective production method of the Shi Baoyu Group, the labor productivity of salt workers and the quality of salt production have been greatly improved. The entire field started spring sweeping in March this year, and by the end of June, it had completed 76.56 percent of the annual production plan. The output increased by 11.95 percent compared with the same period last year, of which first-class salt accounted for about 95 percent. The Shi Baoyu Group produced more than 55,000 dan of salt in three months, completing 112 percent of the annual production plan. Originally, the Huaibei Salt Field followed an old production system, adopting a contract system based on "tan" (a "tan" is the basic means of production in a salt field, including reservoirs, evaporation ponds, crystallization ponds, brine ponds, etc.) as the production unit and family labor as the main body. The characteristics of the Shi Baoyu Group's collective production method are that the "wei" (an enclosure) is the production unit, the means of production are publicly owned and used, labor is unified and allocated, there is a precise division of labor, remuneration is based on labor, and the group leader responsibility system is implemented. Since the promotion of the Shi Baoyu Group's collective production method, Huaibei salt production has begun to change the past individual and dispersed production landscape.

Northeast Coal Industry Building Materials Company Fully Supplies Gasoline and Kerosene

With the rapid development of the oil extraction industry in the Northeast region, the Northeast Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has sufficient gasoline and kerosene to fully supply public and civilian needs. The price of gasoline is now a quarter lower than in October 1951. Therefore, cars and steamships that originally burned charcoal will be converted to use gasoline. It is expected that by the end of this year, the charcoal cars in the entire Northeast region will be converted.

    河南、湖北、广东三省展开夏征工作
    河南、湖北、广东三省的农业税夏季征收工作已全面展开，大部分地区正忙着送粮入仓。河南省大部地区去年已完成了查田定产工作，今年又贯彻执行了“依率计征，依法减免”的方针，对稳定和鼓励农民生产情绪，迅速完成公粮征收任务，起了很大推动作用。湖北省的荆州、黄冈等专区和海南行政区，夏征公粮已经全部入仓。这些地区的查田定产工作将在八、九、十月份大规模进行，为秋季征粮做好准备工作。
    皖北灵璧县合作社批判资本主义思想后，社务和业务都有发展
    灵璧县在根治淮河的伟大工程进行两年以来，已经获得丰收，农民们迫切需要更多的农具。但是灵璧县合作社却存在着资本主义的单纯营利观点，忽视生产资料的供应。在今年四月份以前，农具等生产资料仅占合作社供销货物的四分之一；就是这少量的生产资料，品质也是不好的。
    “三反”运动开始后，批判了社内存在的资本主义思想。现在，该县合作社经营的货物绝大部分是农民迫切需要的生产资料。从四月初到六月底，全县各级合作社共销出农具十二万五千多件，价值七亿一千九百多万元，为社员减除的中间剥削约有二亿二千四百多万元。此外又为社员与一般手工业者代销农具七万九千多件，棉籽、烟叶、粉丝等二千多万斤。因此，社员从不满合作社转变为关心合作社，非社员也纷纷要求入社。
    淮北盐场推广时宝玉小组集体生产方式提高了盐工劳动生产效率和盐产质量
    苏北国营淮北盐场普遍推广时宝玉小组的集体生产方式后，盐工的劳动生产率和盐产质量已大大提高。全场自今年三月开始春扫，至六月底已完成全年生产计划的百分之七十六点五六，产量比去年同时期提高了百分之十一点九五，其中头等盐占百分之九十五左右。该场时宝玉小组三个月中即产盐五万五千多担，完成了全年生产计划的百分之一百十二。原来淮北盐场是沿袭着一套旧的生产制度，采用以滩（滩是盐场的基本生产资料，包括蓄水池、蒸发池、结晶池、卤池等）为生产单位，以家庭劳动为主体的包工制。时宝玉小组集体生产方法的特点，是以圩为生产单位，生产资料公有公用，劳动力统一调配，精密分工，按劳取酬，并实行组长负责制。时宝玉小组的集体生产方法推广以后，淮北盐业生产已开始改变了过去个体的分散的生产面貌。
    东北煤业建筑器材公司充分供应汽油和煤油
    在东北区采油工业飞跃发展的情况下，中国煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司已有丰足的汽油和煤油，可以充分供应公需民用。现在汽油牌价已比一九五一年十月降低四分之一，因此，原来烧木炭的汽车、汽船都将改用汽油，预计到今年年底，东北全区的木炭汽车就可以改装完毕。
