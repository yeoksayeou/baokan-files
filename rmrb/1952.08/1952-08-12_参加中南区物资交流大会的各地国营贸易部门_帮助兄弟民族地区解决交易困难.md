State-Owned Trading Departments Participating in the Central South China Materials Exchange Conference
Help Brotherly Ethnic Minority Regions Solve Trade Difficulties

At the Central South China Materials Exchange Conference, the state-owned trading departments from various regions enthusiastically assisted trade representatives from brotherly ethnic minority regions in resolving difficulties in trade. For example, the delegation from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region urgently needed tea, sugarcane, and cigarettes from the Jiangnan region, but they could only afford to purchase these after selling their own local specialties such as black melon seeds and cream. After learning about this situation, the conference leadership widely publicized it in the conference's special publication and on the radio, and actively connected with various parties to negotiate sales, eventually selling all 1.5 million jin of black melon seeds. Among them, 1.46 million jin were sold to the Guangzhou International Trade Industry, and the transaction was only completed after the China Native Produce Company Central South China Branch matched it with a batch of fast-selling goods. The main local product of the Li ethnic region of Hainan Island, red and white rattan (which can be used to weave various furniture), also had poor sales at the conference; the Guangdong Branch of the China Native Produce Company purchased 3,950 dan at once, about one-seventh of Hainan Island's annual output of red and white rattan, in order to help the brotherly ethnic minorities solve their difficulties. The China Oils and Fats Company Central South China Branch also specially purchased a batch of tung oil worth 2.4 billion yuan from the Hunan trade delegation to take care of the living and production interests of the ethnic minorities in western Hunan. A large quantity of pigments needed by ethnic minorities in the Southwest region could not be found at the conference. Finally, with the help of the China Industrial Equipment Company Central South China Branch, their needs were met.

Because many of their slow-selling local and special products found markets at the conference, ethnic minorities from various regions obtained the funds to purchase the various materials they needed. For example, after selling black melon seeds, the Inner Mongolia delegation purchased 1,000 boxes of brick tea, 57,000 jin of black tea, 8,000 jin of brown sugar, and 320 boxes of cigarettes. After selling a large quantity of sugarcane and red and white rattan and other local and special products, the Hainan delegation also purchased a lot of homespun cloth, matches, general merchandise, vermicelli, cigarettes, and other daily necessities needed by the Li people.

    参加中南区物资交流大会的各地国营贸易部门
    帮助兄弟民族地区解决交易困难
    在中南区物资交流大会上，与会的各地国营贸易部门，大力帮助各兄弟民族地区贸易代表解决交易中的困难。例如：内蒙古自治区的代表团迫切需要江南的茶叶、蔗糖和香烟等，但是他们只能在卖掉自己的黑瓜子、奶油等土特产后才有钱购买。大会领导方面了解这种情况后，一面在大会专刊上和广播中广为宣传，一面多方接头洽商，帮助推销，终于把一百五十多万斤的黑瓜子全部销出。其中，卖给广州市国际贸易业的一百四十六万斤，由中国土产公司中南区公司搭配一批畅销货后才成交的。海南岛黎族地区的主要土产红白藤（可编制各种家具），在大会上的销路也不好；中国土产公司广东省分公司为了帮助兄弟民族解决困难，一次就购进三千九百五十担，约占海南岛红白藤年产量的七分之一。中国油脂公司中南区公司为照顾湘西少数民族的生活和生产利益，也特地向湖南贸易代表团收购了一笔价值二十四亿元的桐油。西南区少数民族需要的大量颜料，在会上买不到，最后还是在中国工业器材公司中南区公司的帮助下，满足了要求。
    各地少数民族由于许多滞销的土产、特产在会上找到了销路，因而得到了购买自己需要的各种物资的资金。如内蒙古代表团把黑瓜子销出后，买进了一千箱砖茶、五万七千斤红茶、八千斤赤砂糖和三百二十箱香烟等。海南代表团销出大批蔗糖和红白藤等土产、特产后，也购进了许多土布、火柴、百货、粉丝、香烟等黎族人民的日用必需品。（新华社）更正八月六日第二版“多方面开辟肥料来源，提高肥料质量，保证完成增产任务”一文第三栏第二十四行和第四栏第八行的“氨肥”均为“氮肥”之误。
