Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 3rd - Korean Red Cross representative Kim Min-san spoke at the General Committee of the 18th International Red Cross Conference on July 30th, condemning the US interventionist forces for violating the Geneva Convention, massacring and persecuting Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and committing serious crimes such as germ warfare.

Kim Min-san began by saying: We come from an oriental peninsula across the Pacific Ocean, where a war is going on, and now we represent the millions of Korean people ravaged by war to speak to you.

Kim Min-san continued: Why has the Korean armistice negotiation, which is expected by all Korean people and the people of the world, not reached an agreement? It can be clearly stated that the only issue hindering the Korean armistice negotiation is the prisoner-of-war issue. This is because the foreign aggressors who launched the war against Korea do not abide by the Geneva Convention; they arbitrarily massacre and abuse Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, and under the pretext of so-called "voluntary repatriation," they forcibly detain a large number of our prisoners of war, preventing them from returning home to live peaceful lives. It is the enemy's unfair and inhumane policy that is hindering the armistice negotiations.

Kim Min-san then cited many specific examples to illustrate how foreign interventionists cruelly massacred and persecuted Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. They used poison gas, flamethrowers, and tanks to carry out mass killings, dismemberment, torture, and beatings against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and even used Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to experiment with bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. In order to conceal their violation of the Geneva Convention under the guise of so-called "voluntary repatriation," the armed interventionists also conducted forced interrogations and forcibly tattooed humiliating words on the bodies of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Kim Min-san pointed out that all these facts are well known to the people of the world and have also been acknowledged by Colonel Carlson, the former commander of the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp. These are unforgivable crimes committed by the invaders in violation of the Geneva Convention they signed on August 12, 1949.

Kim Min-san then pointed out that the foreign invaders not only violated the Geneva Convention but also used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, thereby violating the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925.

When the foreign interventionist forces withdrew from northern Korea from December 1950 to January 1951, they spread smallpox virus in several northern provinces. Since January 1952, the invading forces have been conducting, and are still continuing to conduct, large-scale germ warfare in Korea and China. This germ warfare was carried out after long-term preparation and according to a detailed plan, and was guided and assisted by Japanese germ warfare criminals. According to incomplete statistics, from January 28 to March 31, 1952, the invaders spread insects and various objects carrying bacteria over northern Korea 804 times. According to scientists' analysis reports, the insects and various objects spread by enemy aircraft carried bacteria and viruses such as plague, cholera, and typhoid fever, which seriously endanger humans, livestock, and crops. However, the enemy did not achieve their goal of mass killing. The Korean government has taken effective preventive measures, and various social organizations have actively helped, thus leading the entire people to promptly eliminate and prevent various diseases.

Millions upon millions of people in Korea and China have personally witnessed enemy aircraft dropping germ bombs and various insects. In addition to this, there are the following witnesses: 1. Captured enemy agents Wang Qi and Han Zhengyu. They confessed that they had been ordered by the enemy's intelligence organization to infiltrate northern Korea to collect intelligence on the effects of germ warfare. 2. Captured US Air Force personnel Quinn and Enoch. In their confessions, they admitted to participating in the dropping of germ bombs on several occasions. 3. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team, which went to northern Korea and northeastern China in March this year to conduct on-the-spot investigations. The investigation team obtained evidence proving that the United States was conducting germ warfare and has published a detailed report. 4. The "Investigation Team on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by US Imperialism" led by Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross, and composed of many experts, conducted investigations in Korea and northeastern China. The team obtained ample evidence and has published an investigation report. No matter how those who used bacteriological weapons try to deny it, they cannot escape responsibility for their heinous crimes in the face of the above-mentioned numerous pieces of evidence and witnesses.

Kim Min-san also denounced the aggressors' atrocities of indiscriminately bombing peaceful Korean towns and peaceful Korean residents. According to incomplete statistics, from the beginning of the Korean War to May of this year, 18,000 children under the age of fourteen have died in enemy bombings. Enemy aircraft have also repeatedly bombed Red Cross hospitals and prisoner-of-war camps, all of which are clearly marked. At the end of June, enemy aircraft bombed the Supung hydroelectric power plant on the Yalu River, a peaceful facility that had nothing to do with military targets.

Kim Min-san concluded: The International Red Cross Organization is an organization that upholds humanitarian principles. Can we turn a blind eye and remain silent while the invading forces are committing such inhumane crimes that violate the spirit of the Red Cross? In order to safeguard the Geneva Convention and the dignity of the Red Cross, we should unanimously condemn the inhumane acts of foreign interventionists and immediately stop the crimes of foreign aggressors endangering humanity.

### 朝鲜代表金民山在国际红十字大会总务委员会上  谴责美军屠杀战俘进行细菌战等罪行

    朝鲜代表金民山在国际红十字大会总务委员会上
    谴责美军屠杀战俘进行细菌战等罪行
    【新华社多伦多三日电】朝鲜红十字会代表金民山七月三十日在第十八届国际红十字大会总务委员会上发言，谴责美国干涉军破坏日内瓦公约、屠杀和迫害朝中战俘、进行细菌战等严重罪行。
    金民山首先说：我们来自太平洋彼岸的一个东方半岛，在那个地方，战争正在进行，现在我们代表千百万受到战争蹂躏的朝鲜人民向你们讲话。
    金民山接着说：为所有朝鲜人民和全世界人民所瞩望的朝鲜停战谈判，为什么还没有达成协议呢？可以明白地说，阻碍朝鲜停战谈判的唯一问题是战俘问题。这是因为对朝鲜发动战争的外国侵略者不遵守日内瓦公约；他们恣意屠杀和虐待朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战俘，并在所谓“自愿遣返”的藉口下，强迫扣留我们的大批战俘，不让他们回家过和平生活。阻碍停战谈判的，就是敌方的这种不公平的和不人道的政策。
    金民山于是举出许多具体事例，说明外国干涉者如何残酷地屠杀和迫害朝中战俘的情形。他们对朝中战俘施放毒瓦斯、用火焰喷射器和坦克来进行大规模杀戮、肢解、酷刑毒打，以至利用朝中战俘来试验细菌武器化学武器和其他大批屠杀武器。为了掩饰他们破坏日内瓦公约的所谓“自愿遣返”，武装干涉者还进行了强迫讯问，并在朝中战俘身上强迫刺上耻辱的字样。金民山指出：所有这些事实都已为全世界人民所熟知，并且也为前巨济岛战俘营长官柯尔生所承认。这些都是侵略者违反他们在一九四九年八月十二日签字的日内瓦公约而犯下的不可恕的罪行。
    金民山接着指出：外国侵略者不仅破坏了日内瓦公约，而且还在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，从而破坏了一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书。
    外国侵略军在一九五零年十二月到一九五一年一月自朝鲜北部撤退时，即在北部几个道散布天花病毒。自一九五二年一月以来，侵略军在朝鲜和中国大规模地进行了并且现在仍在继续进行着细菌战。这种细菌战是经过长期准备和按照详细计划进行的，并得到日本细菌战犯的指导和帮助。据不完全统计，自一九五二年一月二十八日到三月三十一日，侵略者在朝鲜北部上空撒布带有细菌的昆虫和各种东西有八百零四次。据科学家化验后报告，敌机撒布的昆虫和各种东西，带有鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒等各种严重危害人类、牲畜和农作物的细菌和病毒。然而，敌人并没有达到他们的大批杀人的目的。朝鲜政府采取了有效的预防措施，各社会团体加以积极的帮助，这样领导了全体人民及时扑灭和防止了各种疾病。
    朝鲜和中国的千千万万的老百姓都亲眼看见了敌机投下的细菌弹和各种昆虫，除此之外，还有下列证人：一、被捕获的敌军特务王琦及韩正玉。他们供认曾奉敌军情报组织之命潜入朝鲜北部收集关于细菌战效果的情报。二、被俘的美国空军人员奎恩和伊纳克。他们在自白书中承认数度参加投掷细菌弹的工作。三、今年三月前往朝鲜北部和中国东北进行实地调查的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团。调查团获得了证明美国进行细菌战的证据，并已发表了详细的报告。四、在朝鲜和中国东北进行了调查的以中国红十字会会长李德全为首的、由许多专家组成的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”。该团获得了充分的证据，并已发表了调查报告。无论那些使用了细菌武器的人们如何设法否认，但是，在上述许多证据和证人面前，他们是不能逃避对其滔天罪行所应负的责任的。
    金民山并痛斥侵略者对朝鲜和平城镇以及朝鲜和平居民滥肆轰炸的暴行。据不完全的统计，自朝鲜战争开始后到今年五月，在敌人轰炸下死亡的十四岁以下的儿童即达一万八千人。敌机并一再轰炸红十字医院和战俘营，而这些地方都是设有非常清楚的标志的。六月底，敌机又轰炸了与军事目标毫无关系的和平设施——鸭绿江上的水丰发电厂。
    金民山最后说：国际红十字组织是维护人道原则的组织。难道我们能够眼看侵略军队干着这种不人道的、违反红十字精神的罪行而默不作声吗？为了维护日内瓦公约和红十字的尊严，我们应该一致谴责外国干涉者的不人道行为，并立即制止外国侵略者危害人类的罪行。
