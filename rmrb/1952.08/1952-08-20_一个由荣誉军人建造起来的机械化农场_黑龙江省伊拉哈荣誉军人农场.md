    A Mechanized Farm Built by Honored Veterans
    -- Yila Ha Honored Veterans Farm in Heilongjiang Province
    Ding Lüshu
    If you take a train north from Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, you'll see an endless wilderness. This is what people usually call "Bei Da Huang" (Great Northern Wilderness). Here, you will see rows of new-style Western houses, neatly arranged in the "wilderness." Factory chimneys emit thick smoke, tractors speed across the fields, and cars, trailers, and rubber-wheeled carts transport materials back and forth. At night, people can see the bright electric lights shining from the houses. At this time, one might feel that they are not in the "Bei Da Huang" wilderness, but approaching a city. However, this is not a city, but a modern mechanized farm personally built by a group of honored veterans of the People's Liberation War in the "Bei Da Huang" wilderness within a hundred li radius. This farm has already reclaimed 2,400 hectares of land, constructed 10,000 square meters of new-style houses, and also has a power plant, a grain processing factory, and a machine repair factory to supply the farm with electricity.
    In 1948, after the comprehensive victory of the Northeast Liberation War, the People's Government established a Honored Veterans School in the Dongping area of Zhenlai County. Many honored veterans came here to study. In order to create wealth for the country and reduce the burden on the people, they voluntarily organized themselves to study and cultivate the land.
    In the autumn of 1949, the Northeast People's Government's Veterans Work Committee (now the Northeast People's Government's Civil Affairs Department's Preferential Treatment Bureau) recognized the great achievements of the Dongping Honored Veterans School in production. They called on them to further establish mechanized farms and decided that the farm's funds would be subsidized by the government, and the personnel's living expenses would still be provided by the government. After production had a foundation and accumulated certain management experience, the farm would then be changed into a collective farm. In this way, on the one hand, it could enable the honored veterans to settle down and establish a happy life; on the other hand, it could also use the concrete facts of the mechanized farm to educate the peasants, making them realize that agricultural collectivization is the bright path to a happy life. The honored veterans of the school actively responded to the government's call. Because the land conditions in Dongping were poor and not suitable for the large-scale development of the farm, they decided to move the farm to its current location - the fertile "Bei Da Huang" grassland in the third district of Nenjiang County.
    The honored veterans arrived in "Bei Da Huang" in October 1949, when the snow was falling heavily. They set up tents and sheds in the snow to resist the severe cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius, and then built houses with ice and snow. There was no water to drink in "Bei Da Huang," so they broke through the hard, frozen ground and dug wells. In order to obtain materials for making farm tools and building houses, they went to Halaba, more than 50 li away from the farm, and Xing'anling, more than 300 li away, to cut and transport wood for the forestry organs. In two months, more than 100 honored veterans transported 450 cubic meters of wood and obtained labor remuneration of more than 200 cubic meters of wood. This provided materials for building houses and making farm tools. The People's Government allocated tractors to the farm, but the farm lacked tools for transporting materials and spare parts for repairing machinery. Comrade Chi Zixiang, who lost half a leg in the revolutionary war, led everyone to collect scrap iron and made machine parts and trailers for transporting materials himself. Without power, lathes and drilling machines could not work, so they used manpower to pull leather belts instead of power. Under the leadership of the farm's Party branch, they overcame various difficulties and finally made eight-wheeled trailers with a load of more than 10,000 jin and more than 1,200 kinds of parts. The difficulties of transportation and machinery repair in the early stage of construction were thus overcome. The honored veterans learned to drive and repair tractors with fearless revolutionary enthusiasm. Some people had their fingers crushed by the machines, wrapped them in bandages, and continued to learn. Comrade Chen Renhuai, who lost an arm in the revolutionary war, also learned to drive a tractor and became a member of the tractor team.
    With the full support of the People's Government, the honored veterans produced and built at the same time, and finally built a modern mechanized farm in "Bei Da Huang." These People's Liberation Army soldiers who had bravely killed the enemy in the war quickly became advanced producers in the construction of the motherland. They not only established the farm, but also gradually learned advanced production technologies and management methods, enabling the farm to initially play a demonstration role.
    The honored veterans gradually improved their farming methods and found the key to increasing yield per unit area. This can be seen from the comparison of the production achievements in 1950 and 1951. When spring plowing and sowing in 1950, everyone still lacked production knowledge. When sowing, only a general provision was made for the sowing amount per hectare of wheat to be 240 jin and soybeans to be 120 jin. In that year, the average harvest was 1,000 jin of grain per hectare. By the spring plowing of 1951, everyone realized the importance of paying attention to technology. First, they carefully studied the spacing of plants and rows for sowing and came up with a practical standard: the row spacing for sowing wheat should be 15 centimeters, sowing 75 to 80 grains per meter, and each square meter should require 450 wheat plants to grow. Soybeans were also sown according to a certain plant and row spacing. All seeds were selected from excellent varieties and were carefully selected and disinfected. In that year, the farm implemented deep plowing and early sowing, and the sowing depth was also appropriate. The result of improving farming methods was a huge change in production volume. In that year, the average yield of soybeans per hectare reached 2,300 jin, and wheat reached 2,100 jin. The highest yield of wheat reached 5,000 jin per hectare. The average harvest of wheat on the farm far exceeded the average yield of 1,500 jin per hectare by local farmers that year.
    In terms of management, the honored veterans initially learned scientific methods of rationally organizing labor and distributing the fruits of labor. The farm carried out the division of labor according to the principle of "from each according to his ability," giving play to the superiority of collective production. For example, the Second Branch Farm had a total of 59 people, including 12 family members and women, 8 children, and 39 men. The director, deputy director, accountant, teacher, and administrator of the farm, a total of 5 people, were responsible for the farm's operation and management, financial revenue and expenditure, and cultural education. The remaining members were divided according to the strength of their labor and the degree of disability. Two severely disabled comrades could not go to the ground and were responsible for night watch, guarding, and raising pigs. One very old comrade was responsible for odd jobs in the farm because of his weak health. Three weaker, more severely disabled members were responsible for feeding the farm's 60 horses. Women were engaged in planting vegetables, making tofu, and taking care of children. The 28 male laborers with strong physical strength were organized into three production teams to undertake the main agricultural labor. In order to give play to everyone's labor enthusiasm, the Second Branch Farm adopted a management method of dividing areas of responsibility and taking charge to the end. The three production teams were responsible for managing three cultivated areas respectively, and launched production competitions. Due to the implementation of the division of labor and responsibility system, everyone's labor efficiency was improved. During the spring sowing last year, 28 male laborers used horse-drawn farm implements to sow 200 hectares of wheat in six days and 250 hectares of soybeans in five days. The annual production income was also greatly increased. Other branch farms that did not implement the area responsibility system harvested 500,000 to 600,000 jin of grain, while the Second Branch Farm received 800,500 jin.
    Now the farm has begun to pay attention to the issue of distributing the fruits of labor. In the past, the living expenses of all members of the farm were provided by the state, so no attention was paid to solving the problem of distributing the fruits of labor. At that time, labor bonuses were only issued once a year. Therefore, although the farm had proposed the slogans of "settling down and establishing a career" and "developing towards collective farms" in the early stage of construction, everyone's confidence in the farm was not high enough, and their labor enthusiasm was not fully developed. In order to solve this problem, the Party organization of the farm convened a Party representative conference of the entire farm before the spring plowing this year to specifically study the distribution of the fruits of labor. The conference decided to adopt a distribution method of calculating work based on workdays and paying according to labor. This was started on a trial basis in the Second Branch Farm. This method stipulates standard work for each type of labor, with one standard work as one workday, and each workday is calculated as ten points. Each member's work every day is measured by standard work, which is evaluated by everyone and recorded in the book. At the end of the year, the fruits of labor are distributed according to the number of work done by each person. This method was implemented during the spring plowing and quickly raised a problem: the work points of people who do odd jobs and leaders could not be assessed. After further research by everyone, it was decided to divide the farm's labor into six levels: the first level is wheat harvest and autumn harvest, with each workday being two workdays; the second level is summer hoeing, with each workday being 1.75 workdays; the third level is threshing, with each workday being 1.5 workdays; the fourth level is spring plowing and sowing, with each workday being 1.25 workdays; the fifth level is non-field labor odd jobs, with each workday being one workday; and the sixth level is household chores, with each workday being 0.75 workdays. Comprehensively calculated, those who work directly in the fields throughout the year can get an average of 340 workdays per year (excluding holidays), those who do odd jobs can get an average of 292 workdays per year, and the farm director's (collective farm chairman's) workdays are based on the total average workdays of field laborers, and within the range of 20% of the total average workdays, everyone discusses and gives appropriate remuneration. According to the Second Branch Farm's production plan this year: 59 people cultivate 430 hectares of land, with a planned output of 1,075,000 jin of grain, worth 697.75 million yuan. Sideline production can earn 30 million yuan, for a total income of 727.75 million yuan. After deducting taxes paid to the state, production costs, tasks submitted to the general farm, accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and all living expenses, each of the farm's 45 laborers (12 women are equivalent to 6 full laborers) can receive an average of 4.57 million yuan per year in addition to enjoying all welfare benefits in the farm, equivalent to 15,200 jin of sorghum. If a family has two laborers, they can earn more than 30,000 jin of grain a year. The lives of the farm members are getting richer day by day.
    At present, the mechanical equipment of the Honored Veterans Farm is not as good as other mechanical farms in Northeast China. The entire farm has only ten tractors, which can only be used for plowing and harrowing, while the remaining sowing and harvesting operations are mostly done with horse-drawn new-style farm implements, and summer hoeing is done entirely by manpower. This year, the farm has sown a total of 2,400 hectares, an area no less than other farms. Because of the emphasis on farming techniques, the crops are growing well and a good harvest is assured. This year, the honored veterans are experimenting with running a collective farm, preparing to no longer have the state provide living expenses. After half a year of typical experiments, it has been proven that it is entirely possible to develop into a collective farm. Two years of collective production experience and the high political awareness of the honored veterans enable this farm to move towards collectivization relatively smoothly.
    After the collective farm is established, a modern "Honored New Village" will appear on the Yila Ha grassland in "Bei Da Huang." This fact eloquently proves the truth: the Chinese People's Liberation Army is not only a heroic defender of the people's happy life, but even after they are injured and disabled, they are still vanguard fighters in the construction of the motherland.

    一个由荣誉军人建造起来的机械化农场
    ——黑龙江省伊拉哈荣誉军人农场
    丁履枢
    从黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市乘火车北行，是一望无际的荒原。这就是人们通常所说的“北大荒”。在这里，你会看见一排一排新式的洋房，整整齐齐地排列在“荒原”上。工厂里的烟囱冒着浓烟，拖拉机在田野上奔驰，汽车、拖车、胶皮轮大车来来往往地运送物资。在夜间，人们可以看到从房舍里射出来的灿烂的电灯光。这时候，人们会觉得自己不是在“北大荒”的原野上，而是走近了一个城市。但是，这不是城市，这是一群在人民解放战争中的荣誉军人，在百里范围内的“北大荒”原野上亲手建立起来的一座现代化的机械农场。这个农场已经开垦了两千四百公顷土地，建设了一万平方公尺的新式房屋，还有供给农场用电的发电厂、粮米加工厂和机械修理厂。
    一九四八年，东北解放战争全面胜利以后，人民政府在镇赉县东屏地区设立了一座荣誉军人学校。许多荣誉军人到这里来学习。他们为了给国家创造财富，减轻人民负担，自动组织起来，一面学习，一面种地。
    一九四九年秋天，东北人民政府荣军工作委员会（现为东北人民政府民政部优抚局）鉴于东屏荣誉军人学校在生产上取得了很大的成就，就号召他们进一步建立机械化的农场，并决定农场的基金由政府资助，人员的生活费仍由政府供给，等生产有了基础并积累下一定的经营管理的经验以后，再把农场改变为集体农庄。这样，一方面可以使荣誉军人安家立业，建立起幸福的生活；另一方面，也可以用机械农场的具体事实教育农民，使他们认识农业集体化是走向幸福生活的光明大道。该校的荣誉军人积极响应了政府的号召。由于东屏的土地条件较差，不适于农场的大规模的发展，他们决定把农场迁到现在的地点——嫩江县第三区土地肥沃的“北大荒”草原上。
    荣誉军人们在一九四九年十月大雪纷飞的时节到达“北大荒”。他们在雪堆中搭起帐棚和草棚抵御零下四十度的严寒，然后一把冰一把雪地建造房子。“北大荒”没有水吃，他们凿破坚硬如石的冰冻的土地，打起了水井。为了取得制造农具和建筑房舍的材料，他们走到离农场五十多里的哈拉巴和三百多里的兴安岭，替林业机关采伐和运送木头。一百多个荣誉军人在两个月的时间内，运送了四百五十立方公尺木头，取得了二百多立方公尺木头的劳动报酬。这就有了修建房舍和制造农具的材料。人民政府给农场拨来了拖拉机，但农场缺乏运送物资的工具和修理机械的零件。在革命战争中失掉了半只脚的迟子祥同志领导大家搜集废铁，自己动手制造机器零件和搬运物资的拖车。没有动力，旋床和钻床不能工作，他们就用人拉皮带来代替动力。他们在农场党支部的领导下，克服了种种困难，终于制成了载重一万多斤的八轮拖车和一千二百多种零件。建场初期运输工具和修理机械的困难，从此就被克服了。荣誉军人们用无畏的战斗热情学习驾驶和修理拖拉机。有人的手指头被机器轧断了，裹上绷带，继续学习。在革命战争中失掉一只胳臂的陈仁怀同志都学会了驾驶拖拉机，成了拖拉机队的队员。
    在人民政府全力支援之下，荣誉军人们一面生产，一面建设，终于在“北大荒”上建造起一座现代化的机械农场。这些曾在战争中英勇杀敌的解放军战士，很快地变成了建设祖国的先进生产者。他们不仅把农场建立起来了，而且逐步学会了先进生产技术和经营管理的方法。使农场初步发挥了示范作用。
    荣誉军人们逐步改进了耕作方法，找到了提高单位面积产量的关键。这从一九五零年和一九五一年两年的生产成绩的对比中可以看出来。一九五零年春耕播种时，大家还很缺乏生产知识。播种时只笼统地规定了小麦每公顷的播种量为二百四十斤，大豆为一百二十斤。这一年，每公顷平均收获了一千斤粮食。到一九五一年春耕时，大家认识了讲求技术的重要性，首先对于播种的株、行距作了慎重的研究，得出一个切合实际的标准：小麦的播种行距应是十五公分，每一公尺内播种七十五粒到八十粒，每一平方公尺要求生长四百五十株小麦。大豆也按一定的株行距播种。全部种籽都选用优良品种，并经过精选和消毒。这一年农场实行了深耕、早种，播种深度也合适了。改进耕作方法的结果，使生产量发生了巨大的变化。这一年大豆每公顷的平均产量达到二千三百斤，小麦达到二千一百斤。小麦最高产量每公顷达到五千斤。农场小麦的平均收获量，远远超过了当年当地农民每公顷平均收获一千五百斤的产量。
    在经营管理方面，荣誉军人们初步学会了合理组织劳动力和分配劳动果实的科学方法。农场按照各尽所能的原则来进行分工，发挥了集体生产的优越性。例如，二分场共有五十九人，其中家属妇女十二人，小孩八人，男同志三十九人。正副场长、会计、教员、管理员五人，负责全场的经营管理、财务收支和文化教育工作，其余成员按照劳力强弱，残废程度进行分工。两个残废很重的同志不能下地，负责打更、警卫和放猪，一个年龄很大的同志，因身体很弱，负责场里的零活。三个身体较弱残废较重的场员，负责喂养全场的六十匹马。妇女担任种菜、做豆腐和照管小孩等工作。二十八个体力较强的男劳动力编成三个生产小队，担负主要的农业劳动。为了发挥大家的劳动积极性，二分场采取了分区负责，一包到底的管理方法。三个生产小队分别管理三个耕作区，并且开展了生产竞赛。由于实行了分工负责制，大家的劳动效率提高了。二十八个男劳力在去年春播中用马拉农具播种，六天种完了二百公顷小麦，五天种完了二百五十公顷大豆。全年的生产收入也大为提高。没有实行分区专责制的其他分场收获粮食五、六十万斤，二分场却收到了八十万零五千斤。
    现在农场开始注意了分配劳动果实的问题。过去农场全体场员的生活费都由国家供给，因此，没有注意解决劳动果实的分配问题。当时只是每年发给一次劳动奖金。因此，场方虽在建场初期就提出了“安家立业”和“向集体农庄发展”的口号，但大家对农场的信心还是不够高的，劳动积极性也没有充分发挥出来。为了解决这个问题，农场的党组织在今年春耕前召开了全场的党代表大会，专门研究了劳动果实的分配问题。会中决定了采用以劳动日计工，按劳取酬的分配办法。并在二分场开始试行。这个办法是把每种劳动都规定出标准工，以一个标准工作为一个劳动日，每个劳动日算十分，每个场员每天的工作都用标准工加以衡量，由大家评定，记入账簿，年终按各人所作工数分配劳动果实。这个办法在春耕中开始实行，很快发生了一个问题：做零活的人和领导干部的工分无法评定。又经大家研究，决定把全场的劳动划分为六等：第一等是麦收、秋收，每一工作日为两个劳动日；第二等是夏锄，每一工作日为一点七五个劳动日；第三等是脱谷打场，每一工作日为一点五个劳动日；第四等是春耕播种，每一工作日为一点二五个劳动日；第五等是非田间劳动的零活，每一工作日为一个劳动日；第六等是家中的杂务工作，每一工作日为零点七五个劳动日。综合计算起来，一年到头直接下地劳动的，全年平均可得三百四十个劳动日（假日除外），作杂务工作的全年平均可得二百九十二个劳动日，农场场长（农庄主席）的劳动日以田间劳动人员总平均的劳动日数为标准，再在总平均劳动日数百分之二十的范围内，由大家讨论，给以适当的报酬。按照今年二分场的生产计划：五十九口人，耕种四百三十公顷土地，计划产量为一百零七万五千斤粮食，价值六亿九千七百五十万元。副业生产可收入三千万元，共计收入七亿二千七百五十万元。除去向国家缴纳的税金、生产成本、上缴总场任务、公积金、公益金及全部生活费用外，全场四十五个（十二个妇女折合六个全劳力）劳动力，除享受场内一切福利待遇以外，每个劳动力平均全年可分得四百五十七万元，折合高粱一万五千二百斤，一家如果有两个劳动力，一年就可以收入三万多斤粮食。场员们的生活已一天一天走向富裕。
    目前，荣誉军人农场的机械设备还不如东北其他机械农场。全场只有十台拖拉机，只能在耕地耙地时使用机器，其余播种、收割大部分作业还是使用马拉新式农具，夏锄则完全要用人力。今年农场共播种了二千四百公顷，面积不比其他农场为少。因为讲求了耕作技术，庄稼生长良好，丰收有了把握。今年荣誉军人们正在试办集体农庄，准备不再由国家供给生活费用。经过半年来的典型试验，证明发展成为集体农庄是完全可能的。两年多的集体生产的经验，荣誉军人的高度的政治觉悟，使这个农场能够比较顺利地走上集体化。
    集体农庄建立以后，在“北大荒”的伊拉哈草原上，将要出现一个现代化的“荣誉新村”。这一事实雄辩地证明了这样一个真理：中国人民解放军不仅是人民的幸福生活的英勇保卫者，即使在他们受了伤成了残废以后，他们仍然是建设祖国的先锋战士。
