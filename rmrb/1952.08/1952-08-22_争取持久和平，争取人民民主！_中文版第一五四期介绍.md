The Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, No. 154, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Soviet Union's First Great Communist Construction Project," stating that the completion of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal is an event of great international significance and an outstanding contribution by the Soviet people to the cause of peace. The Soviet state's genuinely peace-loving policy and magnificent peace construction plans are becoming increasingly apparent to the world; the realization of these plans means continuously improving the material and cultural life of the working people and ensuring the development of society's material and spiritual strength to the highest stage. The editorial points out that the construction of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal demonstrates the Soviet Union's enormous technological progress, the flourishing of Soviet science, and the growth of new technical cadres. However, this canal is only one link in the great Stalin plan for building communism. The major issue of rapidly developing the Soviet Union's peaceful economy is being resolved in an extremely complex manner: while realizing the full supply of electricity to the national economy, plans for transforming nature and developing transportation systems must also be realized. After describing how the working people of the People's Republic of China and the People's Democratic countries are making large-scale use of Soviet experience to engage in construction and develop productive forces, the editorial states that the economies of the American and British aggressive blocs stand in sharp contrast to the rapidly developing productive forces of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. About 40 percent of the land in the United States is arid and semi-desert, but only 1.5 percent of this area has been irrigated and improved in the past hundred years. The great achievements of the Soviet people in peaceful construction have won the heartfelt admiration of the people of the world. Communist and Workers' Parties in all countries, as well as Communist newspapers, should increasingly and widely publicize the achievements of Soviet communist construction among the broad masses and promote the Soviet Union's peace policy to the people of the world.

This issue contains an abstract of the report by Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, at the Second Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany: "The Current Situation and the New Tasks of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany." Ulbricht analyzed the current international situation, the foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic, the crisis of the German Social Democratic Party, the victory of economic construction in 1952, and future socialist construction. Ulbricht finally proposed the future work of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, saying that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has developed into a Marxist-Leninist party, facing the historical task of leading the working class and all working people along the road of socialist construction. The main task at present is to improve the level of the party's organizational work so that the party can be competent for the political tasks it faces. Bold, uncompromising criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom and from bottom to top is the main way to improve the work of the Party Committee. The main ideological work of the party is to teach the working class and the masses of working people with socialist ideas, and at the same time to carry out systematic and constant struggle against bourgeois ideas; it is necessary to cultivate the interest of party members, the entire working class and students in studying Marxism-Leninism.

This issue contains an article by Horváth, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party: "Some Problems in the Political Education Work of the Hungarian Working People's Party." Horváth said: The large-scale persuasion and education work carried out by our party plays a decisive role in raising the consciousness of the people. Our propaganda work is becoming more and more active and systematic. But experience shows that quite a few party organizations and party committees do not fully understand the important role of propaganda work in educating and mobilizing the masses. Some comrades adhere to an incorrect view, believing that persuasion and mobilization are not important for the ruling class and political party. Complacency and arrogance prevent us from continuing to attack the enemy with our superior strength, it paralyzes our revolutionary vigilance, and weakens political and ideological struggles. One of the serious consequences of underestimating political education work and complacency is the weakening of the struggle against the enemy and the paralysis of vigilance. Horváth emphasized: Now that we have begun to build socialism, the shortcomings in the work of educating and persuading the masses are especially intolerable. The purpose of the Five-Year Plan is to lay a solid foundation for socialism in our country, and we must ensure better publicity for the main goal of this plan - the development of heavy industry. The most important task of political work is to ensure that the working people fulfill the guarantees made in the socialist competition. Political work must consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and promote the socialist transformation of agriculture. The work of persuading and educating the masses must be able to answer all the questions of the masses, and must expose the aggressive provocations and other attacks of the enemies of the people - the imperialists - in a militant manner.

This issue also publishes an article by Tesla, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, "Czechoslovakia Fights to Increase Coal Production." Tesla pointed out that due to the development of the Five-Year Plan and socialist construction, the Czechoslovak coal mining industry is facing new tasks, that is, to ensure that the national economy is supplied with sufficient coal. Therefore, in addition to training new coal miners, it is necessary to eliminate the backwardness of mining methods, mechanize the mines, and gradually improve labor organization and use new coal mining methods. The task of the Communists is to persuade the miners to realize that producing more coal is their own business and the business of building socialism. Resolute struggle must be waged against backward views, against the attempts of class enemies and their agents to create an atmosphere of indifference to production tasks, against the suppression of criticism and self-criticism, against underestimating political work among miners, and to correctly solve the important issue - the connection and close cooperation between miners and upright engineering and technical cadres. Tesla said: The struggle to increase coal production, the struggle to overcome difficulties and eliminate shortcomings is still continuing. This is a march towards the happy future of the Czechoslovak People's Republic and our most important contribution to the cause of ensuring world lasting peace.

This issue also publishes articles such as "The Belgian People Oppose the Bonn Separate Treaty" by Larman, General Secretary of the Belgian Communist Party. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五四期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五四期已经出版。
    本期发表题为“苏联的第一个伟大共产主义建设工程”的社论说：列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的完成，是一件具有伟大国际意义的事件，是苏联人民对和平事业的卓越贡献。苏维埃国家的真正爱好和平的政策、宏伟的和平建设计划，越来越明显地呈现在全世界的面前；实现这些计划就是不断提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活，保证社会的物质和精神力量发展到最高阶段。社论指出：列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的建设，表现了苏联在技术上的巨大进步，苏联科学的昌盛和新的技术干部的成长。但是，这条运河不过是建设共产主义的伟大斯大林计划中的一个环节而已。迅速发展苏联和平经济这个重大的问题，正在极其复杂的方式下加以解决：在实现以充分电力供给国民经济的同时，还要实现改造大自然和发展运输系统的计划。社论在叙述了中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的劳动人民正在大规模地利用苏联的经验来从事建设和发展生产力之后说：美英侵略集团各国的经济与苏联和各人民民主国家迅速发展的生产力，恰成一尖锐的对照。美国约有百分之四十的土地是干旱与半沙漠地带，但其中只有百分之一点五的地区在近一百年以来才得到灌溉和改良。苏联人民在和平建设上所获得的伟大成就，博得了全世界人民的衷心赞美。各国共产党和工人党，以及各国共产党报刊应当日益广泛地在广大群众中宣传苏联共产主义建设的成就，向全世界人民宣传苏联的和平政策。
    本期刊载了德国统一社会党总书记乌布利希在德国统一社会党第二届代表会议上的报告的摘要：“目前的形势和德国统一社会党的新任务”，乌布利希就当前的国际形势、德意志民主共和国的外交政策、德国社会民主党的危机、一九五二年经济建设的胜利和未来的社会主义建设等问题作了分析。乌布利希最后提出德国统一社会党今后的工作说：德国统一社会党已经发展成为马克思主义—列宁主义的党，它面临着领导工人阶级和全体劳动人民沿着建设社会主义大道前进的历史任务。目前的主要任务是提高党的组织工作的水平，使党能胜任它所面临的政治任务。大胆的、不讲情面的、从上而下和从下而上的批评与自我批评，是改进党委会工作的主要办法。党的主要的思想工作是以社会主义思想向工人阶级和劳动人民群众谆谆教诲，同时对资产阶级思想进行有系统的、经常的斗争；必须培养党员、全体工人阶级和学生学习马克思—列宁主义的兴趣。
    本期刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会政治局委员霍瓦特的文章：“匈牙利劳动人民党政治教育工作中的一些问题”。霍瓦特说：我党所进行的大规模的说服教育工作，在提高人民的觉悟方面起着决定性的作用。我们的宣传鼓动工作越来越活跃和系统化了。但是经验证明，还有相当多的党组织和党委会没有完全了解宣传鼓动工作对于教育和动员群众的重要作用。有些同志坚持一种不正确的见解，认为对于执政的阶级和政党来说，说服和动员是不重要的。自满和自负妨碍我们运用优势的力量继续进攻敌人，它使我们革命的警觉性麻痹起来，削弱政治和思想斗争。低估政治教育工作和自满的严重后果之一，就是对敌斗争的削弱和警觉性的麻痹。霍瓦特强调说：现在，我们已着手建设社会主义，因此对于教育和说服群众的工作中的缺点尤其不能容忍。五年计划的目的是要为我国的社会主义奠定巩固的基础，我们必需保证更好地宣传这个计划的主要目标——发展重工业。政治工作最重要的任务是确保劳动人民完成在社会主义竞赛中所作的保证。政治工作必需巩固工农联盟，促进农业的社会主义改造。对群众的说服教育工作必须能解答群众的一切问题，必须以战斗的姿态、积极地揭发人民的敌人——帝国主义者的侵略挑衅和其他攻击行为。
    本期还刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记特斯拉的“捷克斯洛伐克为提高煤产量而斗争”一文。特斯拉指出：由于五年计划和社会主义建设的发展，捷克斯洛伐克煤矿工业面临着新的任务，即确保以充分的煤炭供应国民经济。因此，除了训练新的煤矿工人以外，必须消灭采矿方法的落后现象，把矿井机械化，同时要逐步改进劳动组织并利用新的采煤方法。共产党员的任务是说服矿工，使他们认识到生产更多的煤是他们自己的事业，是建设社会主义的事业。必须进行坚决的斗争，反对落后观点，反对阶级敌人及其代理人对于生产任务制造漠不关心的空气的企图，反对压制批评与自我批评，反对低估矿工中的政治工作，正确地解决重要问题——矿工与正直的工程、技术干部之间的联系与紧密合作问题。特斯拉说：争取提高煤的产量的斗争，克服困难与消灭缺点的斗争仍在继续，这是走向捷克斯洛伐克人民共和国的幸福的将来的进军，是我们对确保世界持久和平的事业最重要的贡献。
    本期还刊载了比利时共产党总书记拉尔曼的“比利时人民反对波恩单独条约”等文章。（新华社）
