Editor's Note: Experience in various places has proven that carrying out appraisal campaigns is a good method for promoting the patriotic production increase movement and summarizing bumper harvest experiences, and a good method for correcting the tendencies of unfinished business and formalism in the production increase competition movement. However, appraisal campaigns must be led, must be truly mass-based, and must be closely integrated with current production work; otherwise, they may also become mere formalities. The bumper harvest appraisal campaign carried out in Longquan Township, Hancheng, Shaanxi this year during the wheat harvest was relatively successful. Now that the autumn appraisal work is about to begin, the experience of the bumper harvest appraisal campaign in Longquan Township, Hancheng, can be used as a reference for various places.

In order to summarize bumper harvest experiences, establish bumper harvest banners, and lay an ideological foundation for future patriotic production increase movements, Hancheng County, Shaanxi Province, comprehensively launched a wheat bumper harvest appraisal campaign this year. Longquan Township is one of the key townships in this appraisal campaign. The Secretary of the Hancheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party personally led this movement, and in a short period of half a month, mobilized the masses, conducted good bumper harvest surveys, exchanged bumper harvest experiences, improved the masses' confidence in striving for bumper harvests, and promoted summer production and autumn planting work.

    **Relieving the Ideological Concerns of Cadres and the Masses**

Bumper harvest appraisal is a new task. At the beginning of the appraisal campaign, general district and township cadres did not fully understand the significance of the appraisal. They regarded the appraisal as a bumper harvest survey, as work outside of wheat harvesting and seed selection; therefore, they were afraid that carrying out the appraisal would affect wheat harvesting and seed selection: "We are here to lead the masses in production; what if we delay the masses' production?" They did not dare to boldly mobilize the masses, did not dare to convene meetings of the masses, and only wanted to get the bumper harvest figures out and report them, which they considered completing the task. They were busy finding bumper harvest fields, measuring areas, counting wheat ears, and measuring yields.

The masses also had concerns. Some were afraid that appraising a bumper harvest would "increase the burden"; some were afraid that after becoming a bumper harvest model, the higher authorities would "ask for materials every three days and experiences every two days"; some believed that "dryland wheat can't catch up with Li Yinting, and irrigated wheat can't catch up with Shi Anfu, so we can't be appraised anyway." Therefore, they were not interested in the appraisal and only wanted to deal with it perfunctorily.

The County Committee understood these ideological situations and first convened a meeting of the work team to clear the cadres' minds. After repeated discussions, everyone recognized that the main purpose of carrying out the bumper harvest appraisal campaign was to promote agricultural production; if the movement was carried out well, it would not only not hinder wheat harvesting and seed selection, but also promote wheat harvesting and seed selection work; at the same time, only by mobilizing the masses to carry out the bumper harvest appraisal campaign could bumper harvest survey work be done well.

Once the cadres' thinking was clear, they immediately carried out propaganda and education work among the masses. Through various propaganda methods and various small meetings, they conducted patriotic education among the masses, focusing on publicizing the bumper harvest reward policy and using the real people and real events of local bumper harvest models to eliminate the ideological concerns of the masses. When the ideological preparation of the cadres and the masses was mature, they immediately launched the county, district, and township-level wheat bumper harvest appraisal red flag competition.

    **Conducting a Led, Mass-Based Appraisal Campaign**

The appraisal campaign began on May 27th and ended on June 10th. The appraisal campaign was completely integrated with the wheat harvest. The appraisal campaign can be divided into four stages:

    (1) Field Appraisal, Discovering Targets

First, based on mutual aid teams, "individual households" were absorbed to participate, and a preliminary bumper harvest appraisal was carried out using the method of self-reporting and public discussion. The masses self-reported the area and yield of bumper harvest fields, and the team members went to the fields to appraise each other; then the village appraisal team conducted a re-appraisal in the field based on the mutual aid team's appraisal results. The method of appraisal was to "compare crops" ("estimate yield from the good or bad growth of crops"), "compare varieties" (compare the quality and purity of varieties, and initially compare the whole village's superior varieties), "compare technology" (initially find out the reasons for bumper harvests). Those selected in the field appraisal were marked with small red, yellow, and green paper flags according to the yield level, indicating the appraisal results, and then published by the township government; and several typical examples were found and the masses were organized to visit the fields. This initially discovered bumper harvest targets. Since the bumper harvest targets had been inspected by the masses in the fields, this created conditions for further appraisal; in the initial appraisal, bumper harvest experiences were also initially exchanged.

    (2) Launching the Summer Harvest Competition, Setting Off a Wave of Appraisal

During the field appraisal, not all bumper harvest lands were necessarily discovered, and the calculation of yields was not necessarily accurate. After the field appraisal, a summer harvest competition was launched based on mutual aid teams, absorbing individual households to participate, comparing bumper harvests (comparing the size and yield of bumper harvest land), comparing summer selection (comparing the quality of varieties, comparing the amount and quality of seed selection), comparing summer harvest (comparing the speed and quality of harvesting and threshing). The competition was continuous: from households to households, developing into teams to teams, villages to villages; the scope of the appraisal continued to expand, and the content also continued to be enriched. As the summer harvest work progressed, the competition and appraisal also progressed. Everyone looked at who's wheat grew well, yielded a lot, was harvested cleanly, threshed quickly, dried well, had good varieties, selected good seeds, had good labor mutual aid, and had great patriotic production increase enthusiasm. People competed to become bumper harvest model households and model teams. Challenge letters and acceptance letters were posted on the doors of every mutual aid team leader and on the village's bulletin board, and the entire township was immersed in a wave of wheat bumper harvest appraisal. A series of summer production work also became tense.

    (3) In-Depth Inspection, Verifying Yield

After the multi-harvest competition was launched, various forms of inspection were conducted in a timely manner. One was for the township work team to conduct a full-township roving inspection in a high-profile manner; the other was for villages to send or invite representatives to inspect each other. Within the village, the teams challenging and responding to the challenge used the method of exchanging work for harvesting and threshing to inspect each other. The village work team focused on grasping the situation of the inspection. In this way, the advanced were encouraged, the backward were driven, and the tendency of only seeing flag-waving and cheering but not seeing actual action was prevented. When representatives from Zhongsu Village inspected the wheat harvest situation in Beijianbei Village, they discovered some shortcomings in seed selection. After returning to their village, they did not even eat and immediately conducted a village-wide inspection, discovering that two households had not selected seeds and two households had not selected enough. They immediately mobilized them to make up for the selection. Through the inspection, the yield of bumper harvest land was verified, laying the foundation for summarizing the appraisal work.

    (4) Conducting "Five Comparisons," Electing Models

Around June 10th, the entire township had basically cleared the fields and the movement entered the final stage. Therefore, a comprehensive "five comparisons" were conducted (comparing patriotism, comparing mutual aid, comparing crops, comparing technology, comparing harvest), summarizing the appraisal results, and determining where the red flag would be planted.

At this time, the work teams and appraisal teams in each village first gathered materials, held a preparatory meeting, and initially appraised various candidate bumper harvest models, and helped them summarize bumper harvest experiences. Then they submitted them to the village mass meeting for the masses to elect. Before the mass meeting, group discussions of "five comparisons" were carried out. According to the bumper harvest situation, patriotic enthusiasm, political conditions, organizational situation, quality of varieties, level of technology, and specific performance in summer harvest and summer selection, the merits were compared, and the bumper harvest model was "compared out." Then analyze and discuss the reasons for the bumper harvest model's political, economic, and technical achievements, and "compare in" the "five comparison" conditions. In this way, not only were technical experiences exchanged, but also the masses' patriotic bumper harvest emotions were improved. Finally, bumper harvest models were elected at the mass meeting, and they introduced bumper harvest experiences on the spot; at the same time, using them as the backbone, a summer plowing and summer planting competition was launched.

After the village appraisal was completed, people's representative meetings at the township and district levels were convened, and township and district-level appraisals were conducted using the same method, and township and district-level bumper harvest models were selected, and summer plowing and summer planting competitions at the district and township levels were launched.

    **Appraisal Promoted the Patriotic Production Increase Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement**

    (1) Good Bumper Harvest Surveys Were Conducted, and Bumper Harvest Banners Were Established

According to the county's standards, Longquan Township appraised two bumper harvest model villages, ten bumper harvest model mutual aid teams, and thirty bumper harvest households. Because the bumper harvest appraisal was carried out from the bottom up based on mass competition, the appraised bumper harvest models were all real. For example, Xue Benxiang, a wealthy middle peasant in Beijiannan Village, had ideological concerns and initially did not dare to report a bumper harvest, and later reported less; but the mutual aid team he participated in was afraid that this would affect the entire team's failure to obtain victory, so they led him to participate in the competition, and jointly with the Xue Zhouyi mutual aid team that challenged them, conducted an inspection and made the yield accurate. Xue Bencheng in the same village falsely reported the yield; but the Xue Chenghuai mutual aid team that challenged him discovered that his report was not true when exchanging work for threshing, put forward opinions, and made his yield accurate. After repeated discussions during the "five comparisons," the tendencies of blindly pursuing figures, disregarding politics, and neglecting technology were corrected. Du Xueming of Zhongsu Village had a bumper harvest this year; but the masses said: "He left the land barren for two years, and what technology is there in harvesting more this year?" Li Gaosheng of Beipotou Village had a bumper harvest this year, and the masses said that he was very active in doing work for himself, but he did not work hard in the mutual aid team; therefore, he was only nominated for bumper harvest and was not elected as a model. After such an appraisal, the appraised bumper harvest models truly became banners in the hearts of the masses.

    (2) The Masses' Production Enthusiasm Was Aroused, and Labor Efficiency Was Improved

The appraisal was carried out in conjunction with the summer harvest competition, which boosted the masses' production enthusiasm, improved labor efficiency, and strongly promoted summer harvest and summer selection. In previous years, the masses generally only threshed one field of wheat a day, but this year they generally threshed two or more fields. Li Kangyin of Yanjia Village threshed five fields in one day and one night; the Zhao Dingsan mutual aid team in Nanpotou Village threshed six fields. In order to complete the competition plan, all the forces in the countryside were put into production, especially the strength of women and children was brought into play. The number of women and children participating in summer harvest and summer selection in Beijiannan Village increased by two and a half times compared with last year. The entire township basically achieved clean fields in ten to twelve days, shortening the time by five to eight days compared with last year, and completing the original competition plan two or three days in advance.

During the competition, seed selection work was also launched enthusiastically. Superior wheat varieties such as "Shaannong No. 7" suitable for the local area were selected, and 43,020 jin of ear-selected wheat seeds were selected throughout the township, reaching more than 50% of the sowing amount for the next wheat field; Zhongsu Village selected 5,086 jin of ear-selected wheat seeds, enough for the entire village's 469 mu of wheat fields.

The appraisal also promoted preferential treatment work. In previous years, the wheat of revolutionary martyrs' families was assigned by cadres, and everyone shirked responsibility; this year, everyone regarded harvesting wheat for revolutionary martyrs' families as a condition for competition.

After the wheat harvest, everyone guaranteed to pay the public grain well. Zhongsu Village also sent representatives to the county to request pre-payment of public grain, striving for the honor of being the first in the county to pay public grain.

    (3) The Superiority of Organized Production Was Displayed, and the Mutual Aid Organization Was Consolidated and Developed

In the appraisal competition, the superiority of organized collective production was fully displayed. Where the foundation of the mutual aid team was good, there was a bumper harvest, and there could be an early completion of the summer harvest and summer selection tasks, and victory in the competition. Therefore, the mutual aid organization developed rapidly during the summer harvest and after the appraisal. Many temporary mutual aid teams were transformed into perennial mutual aid teams, and new mutual aid teams were constantly being organized. There were only twelve mutual aid teams in Beijiannan Village, which developed to twenty during the summer harvest, and now the number of organized households accounts for 90% of the total number of households in the village. Many unstable and newly developed mutual aid teams were consolidated. In Nanjiannan Village, there were two mutual aid teams, which were divided into male and female groups, which was very inconvenient, and the leadership had repeatedly corrected them to no avail; in this movement, they saw the benefits of other groups being mixed and cooperating, and automatically implemented mixed grouping. The Xue Genxiang mutual aid team in Beijiannan Village lacked labor, and the Xue Zhouwei mutual aid team lacked livestock, so they were not stable and sometimes dispersed and sometimes gathered. During the summer harvest, they jointly challenged and organized together; in the past, it took fifteen days to clear the fields, but this year it only took eight days. They truly realized the benefits of being organized and decided to organize together for a long time.

    (4) The Masses' Patriotic Production Increase Enthusiasm Was Encouraged, and Summer Plowing and Summer Planting Work Was Promoted

The appraisal encouraged the masses' patriotic production increase enthusiasm and promoted summer harvest, summer selection, summer plowing, and summer planting. After the wheat harvest, the irrigated land in the entire township was basically all watered and plowed, and two-thirds of it had been planted with corn. In previous years, there were only forty days from planting corn to the beginning of autumn, but this year there may be fifty to sixty days, which laid the foundation for this year's corn bumper harvest.

During the summer harvest appraisal, the cotton field seedling protection and weeding work was also promoted. Women such as Li Qingfang in Yanjia Village formed three groups while threshing and proposed a competition for weeding the fourth time for cotton fields, weeding 41 mu of cotton fields in two days, and helping four military families weed 13 mu. After the wheat bumper harvest appraisal campaign ended, a summer plowing and summer planting competition was fully launched in the entire township, and each village formulated competition plans with various contents. For example, farmers in Potou Village lacked the habit of accumulating fertilizer, and only 300 mu of the 800 mu of dryland wheat were fertilized; after the appraisal, they realized the truth that "there is a grain pile where there is a manure pile," and the entire village launched a fertilizer accumulation competition, planning to dig 24 more and use green grass, wormwood, wild jujube leaves, etc. to compost, striving to fertilize all the wheat fields this autumn and striving for a bumper harvest next season.

    陕西韩城龙泉乡是怎样开展小麦丰产评比运动的
    中央小麦丰产评比工作队陕西组
    编者按：各地的经验都已证明，开展评比运动是推动爱国增产运动和总结丰产经验的好方法，是纠正增产竞赛运动的有头无尾、形式主义等偏向的好方法。但是，评比运动必须是有领导的，必须真正是群众性的，必须和当前的生产工作紧密结合，否则也可能流于形式。陕西韩城龙泉乡今年麦收时开展的丰产评比运动是比较成功的。现在秋季评比工作即将开始，韩城龙泉乡丰产评比运动的经验可供各地参考。
    为了总结丰产经验，树立丰产旗帜，给今后的爱国增产运动打下思想基础，陕西省韩城县今年全面开展了小麦丰产评比运动。龙泉乡是这次评比运动的重点乡之一。中共韩城县委书记亲自领导这一运动，在半个月的短时间内，发动了群众，作好了丰产调查，交流了丰产经验，提高了群众争取丰产的信心，并推动了夏季生产和秋种工作。
    解除干部和群众的思想顾虑
    丰产评比是一件新的工作。在评比运动开始时，一般区乡干部并不完全了解评比的意义。他们把评比看成丰产调查，看成是麦收、选种以外的工作；因此，他们害怕开展评比会影响麦收和选种：“我们是来领导群众生产的，把群众生产耽误了怎么办呢？”他们不敢放手发动群众，不敢召集群众开会，只想把丰收数字搞出来，报上去，便算完成了任务。他们忙于找丰产田，量面积，数麦穗，测产量。
    群众也是有顾虑的。有的怕评出丰产要“增加负担”；有的怕当上丰产模范以后，上级“三天要材料，两天要经验”；有的认为“旱地麦赶不上李荫亭，水地麦赶不上史安福，反正评不上”。因此对评比不感兴趣，只想应付一下。
    县委了解了这些思想情况，首先召开了工作组会议，打通干部的思想。经过反复讨论，使大家认识了开展丰产评比运动的主要目的是推动农业生产；运动只要开展得好，不仅不会妨碍麦收和选种，而且可以推进麦收和选种工作；同时，只有发动群众开展了丰产评比运动，才能作好丰产调查工作。
    干部思想明确了，立刻开展了对群众的宣传教育工作。他们通过各种宣传方式，召开了各种小型会议，对群众进行爱国主义教育，着重宣传丰产奖励政策，用当地丰产模范的真人真事，消除群众的思想顾虑。干部、群众的思想准备成熟了，紧接着开展了县区乡各级的小麦丰产评比红旗竞赛。
    有领导地开展群众性的评比运动
    评比运动在五月二十七日开始，到六月十日结束。评比运动完全是和麦收结合进行的。评比运动可分为四个阶段：
    （一）田间评比，发现目标
    首先以互助组为基础，吸收“单干户”参加，用自报公议的办法进行初步的丰产评比，由群众自报丰产田的面积和产量，由组员到田间互评；然后由村评比小组根据互助组评定结果到田间复评。评的办法是“比庄稼”“从庄稼长得好坏估计产量”，
    “比品种”（比品种好坏和纯度，初步比出全村优良品种来），“比技术”（初步找出丰产原因）。田间评比当选的，按产量等级，分别插上红黄绿小纸旗，标明评比结果，然后由乡政府出榜公布；并找出几个典型，组织群众到田间观摩。这样就初步发现了丰产目标。由于丰产目标已经过群众田间实地观摩，这就给进一步评比创造了条件；在初评中并初步交流了丰产经验。
    （二）开展夏收竞赛，掀起评比热潮
    在田间评比时，丰产地不一定全被发现，产量的计算也不一定准确。田间评比之后，又以互助组为基础，吸收单干户参加，开展夏收竞赛，比丰产
    （比丰产地面积大小和产量高低），比夏选（比品种好坏，比选种多少、好坏），比夏收（比收碾快慢、好坏）。竞赛的方式是连续性的：由户与户的，发展为组与组的，村与村的；评比面不断扩大，内容也不断充实。随着夏收工作的进展，竞赛和评比也跟着前进了。大家看谁的麦子长得好，打得多，收得净，碾得快，晒得干，品种好，种子选得好，劳动互助好，爱国增产劲头大。人们争着要当丰产模范户和模范组。挑战书和应战书贴满了每一个互助组长的家门口和村的公告栏上，全乡投入了小麦丰产评比的热潮。一系列的夏季生产工作也随着紧张起来了。
    （三）深入检查，核实产量
    多收竞赛展开后，及时进行了各种方式的检查。一种是由乡工作组大张旗鼓地进行全乡巡回检查；另一种是村与村间互派或互邀代表检查。村内挑战应战的组和组之间，利用调工换工收割碾场的办法来互相检查。村的工作组则有重点地掌握检查的情况。这样，鼓舞了先进的，带动了落后的，防止了只见摇旗呐喊、不见实际行动的偏向。中苏村代表检查北涧北村的麦收情况时，发现了一些选种的缺点，他们回村后饭也不吃，立刻进行全村检查，发现有二户没有选种，二户没有选够，立刻动员他们去补选。通过了检查，核实了丰产地的产量，为总结评比工作打下了基础。
    （四）进行“五比”，选举模范
    六月十日左右，全乡基本上已地净场光、运动转入结束阶段。于是进行了综合性的“五比”（比爱国，比互助，比庄稼，比技术，比收成），总结评比结果，确定红旗究竟插在那里。
    这时先由各村工作组和评比小组汇集材料，开准备会，初步评出各种候选丰产模范，并帮助他们总结丰产经验。然后提交全村群众大会，让群众选举。开群众大会以前，分组开展“五比”讨论，根据丰产情况、爱国热情、政治条件、组织起来情况、品种好坏、技术高低和在夏收夏选中的具体表现评比高低，把丰产模范“比出来”。再分析讨论丰产模范在政治上、经济上、技术上获得丰产的原因，把“五比”条件“比进去”。这样，不但交流了技术经验，而且提高了群众爱国丰产的情绪。最后，在群众大会上选举丰产模范，由他们当场介绍丰产经验；同时，以他们为骨干，开展夏耕夏种竞赛。
    村评比完毕后，召开乡区各级人民代表会，用同样办法进行了乡区各级评比，评选出乡区各级丰产模范，并开展区乡各级的夏耕夏种竞赛。
    评比推进了爱国增产互助合作运动
    （一）作好了丰产调查，树立了丰产
    旗帜
    根据县的标准，龙泉乡共评出两个丰产模范村、十个丰产模范互助组、三十个丰产户。因为丰产评比是从下而上地在群众竞赛的基础上进行的，所以评出的丰产模范都是真实的。例如北涧南村薛本祥是一个富裕中农，他思想上有顾虑，先不敢报丰产，后来又报少了；但他所参加的互助组怕因此影响全组得不到优胜，便带动他参加了竞赛，并会同和他们应战的薛周益互助组进行检查，把产量弄确实了。同村薛本年虚报了产量；但和他应战的薛成怀互助组在换工碾场时发现他报的不实，提出意见，把他的产量搞确实了。经过“五比”时的反复讨论，纠正了盲目追求数字、不问政治、忽视技术等偏向。中苏村杜学明今年丰收；但群众说：“他把地荒了二年，今年多收，有啥技术？”北坡头村李高升今年丰收了，群众说他替自己做活很积极，但在互助组内不好好干；因此，只提名丰产，没选上模范。经过这样评比，评出来的丰产模范真正成了群众心目中的旗帜。
    （二）激起了群众生产积极性，提高了劳动效率
    评比结合夏收竞赛进行，鼓舞了群众的生产积极性，提高了劳动效率，有力地推动了夏收夏选。往年群众一般一天只碾一场麦，今年一般碾二场以上。颜家沟李抗隐一天一夜碾了五场；南坡头村赵鼎三互助组碾了六场。为了完成竞赛计划，农村一切力量都投入了生产，特别发挥了妇女儿童的力量。北涧南村妇女儿童参加夏收夏选的比去年增加了二倍半。全乡十天到十二天基本上做到了场净地光，比去年缩短了五天到八天，提前两三天完成原来的竞赛计划。
    在竞赛中，选种工作也热烈展开了。评选出适合于当地的“陕农七号”等优良麦种，全乡穗选麦种四三、○二○斤，达到下季麦田播种量的百分之五十以上；中苏村穗选麦种五、○八六斤，足供全村四六九亩麦田之用。
    评比也推动了优抚工作。往年烈军属的麦子，由干部分派收碾任务，大家互相推诿；今年大家把给烈军属收麦作为竞赛条件。
    麦收后，大家都保证缴好公粮。中苏村并派代表到县要求预缴公粮，争取全县第一名缴公粮的光荣。
    （三）显示了组织起来的优越性，巩固和发展了互助组织
    在评比竞赛中，充分显示了组织起来集体生产的优越性。那里互助组的基础好，那里便丰产，那里便能提前完成夏收夏选任务，获得竞赛优胜。因此，互助组织在夏收中和评比后迅速发展，很多临时性的互助组转为常年互助组，新的互助组也不断组织起来。北涧南村原来只有十二个互助组，夏收中发展到二十个，现在组织起来的户数已占全村总户数百分之九十。许多不巩固的和新发展的互助组得以巩固。南涧南村有两个互助组，男女分组，很不方便，领导方面曾几次纠正无效；在这次运动中，他们看到别组男女合编、分工合作的好处，自动实行混合编组。北涧南村薛根祥互助组缺乏劳力，薛周伟互助组缺乏牲口，因此都不稳固，时散时合。夏收中他们联合挑战，组织在一块；过去十五天才能地净场光，今年只费了八天。他们真正体会到组织起来的好处，决定长期组织在一起了。
    （四）鼓舞了群众爱国增产热情，推动了夏耕夏种工作
    评比鼓舞了群众爱国增产的热情，推动了夏收夏选和夏耕夏种。在麦收完毕后，全乡水浇地基本上已全部浇水开犁，其中三分之二已种上玉米。往年从种玉米到立秋只有四十天，今年可有五十到六十天，这就为今年玉米丰收打下了基础。
    在夏收评比中，也推动了棉田保苗锄地工作。颜家沟村妇女李清芳等十五人分三组在碾场时提出锄第四次棉田的竞赛，两天锄完了四十一亩棉田，并帮助四户军属锄了十三亩。小麦丰产评比运动结束后，全乡全面展开了夏耕夏种竞赛，各村分别定出了各种内容的竞赛计划。如坡头村农民缺乏积肥习惯，八百亩旱地麦只有三百亩施肥；经过了评比，他们认识了“有粪堆便有粮堆”的道理，全村开展了积肥竞赛，计划再增挖二十四个，利用青草、蒿子、野枣叶等沤肥，争取今秋麦田全部施肥，争取下季丰收。
