Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd. A grand report meeting was held in Pyongyang on the evening of July 31st to warmly celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Among those present at the meeting were Li Chengye, Park Chang-ok, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Choi Yong-kun, Minister of National Defense of the Cabinet, Bai Nanyun, Minister of Education, Li Keru, Minister without Portfolio, other party and government leaders, senior generals of the Korean People's Army, combat heroes, and representatives of various democratic parties and mass organizations, as well as workers, farmers, youth, women, cultural workers, and scientific workers from the Pyongyang area. In the guest seats were diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Korea. A delegation of more than one hundred representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, led by Chief Representative General Han Xianchu, was invited to attend. The arrival of the Volunteer Army's combat heroes and meritorious personnel was greeted with enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

After Yoon Gong-heum, Chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, chairman of the meeting, announced the opening of the meeting, all participants unanimously stood up and elected General Kim Il-sung, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Marshal Stalin as honorary chairmen of the meeting with thunderous applause.

Kim Jae-wook, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, delivered a report at the meeting. He first briefly elaborated on the great and glorious path of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, in carrying out a long, arduous, and unyielding revolutionary struggle. He then pointed out that the glorious victory of the great Chinese people and their armed forces, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in overthrowing domestic and foreign reactionary and aggressive forces and creating a people's China, is an example for the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries in their struggle for national liberation, and its rich experience in struggle inspires the confidence of the Korean people in their war of resistance. The great Chinese People's Liberation Army is not only a strong fortress of New China, but also gloriously undertakes the sacred task of defending peace in Asia and the world. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, inheriting and carrying forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has inflicted fatal blows on the American invading army in its joint operations with the Korean People's Army. In the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War, the achievements of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army are great, and their achievements will be forever recorded in Korean history. He concluded by saying that the American imperialists' arrogant goals in the Korean War have become a bubble, and the experience of the Korean War proves that the era in which American imperialists could easily conquer freedom-loving people is gone forever. This is an important summary of the Korean War experience. Final victory will surely belong to the Korean people, and the enemy's failure and destruction are beyond doubt.

Chief Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, General Han Xianchu, then stepped onto the stage amidst warm applause to speak. He said: Today, we are participating in the celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Pyongyang, the temporary capital of Korea, which is bravely fighting against American imperialist aggression, and we feel boundless joy and encouragement. General Han Xianchu said: From the beginning, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been an army armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, combining patriotism and internationalism. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army was organized by using the Chinese People's Liberation Army as an example, and the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army understand that resisting America and aiding Korea is their glorious and great international duty, and they understand that this is completely consistent with the interests of the Chinese people in defending their homes and country. They understand that in order to oppose the common enemy, American imperialism, they must fight side by side with the Korean People's Army until final victory is achieved.

General Han Xianchu continued: It is precisely because the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which uses it as an example, are such a patriotic and internationalist army, that every commander and fighter has a high degree of consciousness and heroic spirit, and bravely fights for the just cause of people's liberation and world peace. Such an army is an army of revolutionary heroism. In front of such an army, there are no insurmountable difficulties, no invincible enemies, and our cause will surely achieve final victory. General Han Xianchu finally, on behalf of the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army, expressed deep gratitude to the Korean people and the Korean People's Army for their great support and friendly assistance, and wished the struggle of the Korean and Chinese people against the American aggressors even greater victories.

The meeting concluded with a thunderous applause and unanimously passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong, the organizer and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 3rd. The leadership organ of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army held a meeting on the 1st to warmly celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. A delegation composed of representatives from all walks of life in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the "Korean People's Army Ensemble" also attended the celebration meeting.

The meeting was opened by Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He said that the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a glorious, victorious, and people's festival. It is of special and great significance for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting in Korea, to gather and celebrate this great festival. Gan Siqi said: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, took the Chinese People's Liberation Army as its glorious example, learned and carried forward the fine traditions of hard work, heroic struggle, and tenaciousness of the Chinese People's Army, and bravely shouldered the glorious and great sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. In the past year or more, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has fought side by side with the Korean People's Army and achieved glorious victories. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army will fight to the end for the glorious task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, and for the sacred cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world.

General Deng Hua, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, delivered a report to the meeting. He said that the great victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the past twenty-five years have been achieved under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's military thinking and genius strategic and tactical thinking have guided the People's Liberation Army to achieve great victories. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has been able to achieve the great victory of resisting America and aiding Korea with inferior equipment precisely by studying and implementing Chairman Mao's military thinking. The American aggressors are now using bacteriological weapons and chemical weapons on the Korean battlefield, and have occupied our country's Taiwan for two years, and are actively preparing to launch a new world war. Standing at the forefront of defending peace, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army should make a hundred times more efforts and be extremely vigilant, strive to study Chairman Mao's military thinking, improve the tactical and technical level of the troops, and train themselves into an even stronger and invincible force to defend the motherland and defend peace.

Kim Cheon-hae, head of the Korean delegation and Minister of Social Affairs of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, warmly congratulated the Chinese People's Liberation Army for its great victories in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies over the past 25 years in his speech. He said that the great victories achieved by the Chinese people and their armed forces—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—have become a guarantee for the victory of the people of the Far East and Asia against imperialist aggression.

General Kim Bong-ryul, representative of the Korean People's Army and Commander of Artillery of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army, after expressing his respect to the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, said that the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army has learned and inherited the glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, carried forward the noble spirit of internationalism and revolutionary heroism, helped the Korean people defeat the American aggressors, and greatly encouraged the fighting will of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army. On behalf of the entire Korean People's Army, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Amidst majestic military music and thunderous applause, General Kim Bong-ryul presented a flag to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army, and presented commemorative albums and gifts. The leaders of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on behalf of all commanders and fighters, received the flag and the gifts, and expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Korean People's Army, and called on all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army to unite more closely and fight to the end for the final victory of the Korean people's anti-aggression war.

Finally, the "Korean People's Army Ensemble" performed wonderful programs such as "The Immortal Internationalist Soldier Luo Shengjiao."
