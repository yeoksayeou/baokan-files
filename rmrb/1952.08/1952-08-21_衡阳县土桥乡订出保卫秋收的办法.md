    Tuqiao Township, Hengyang County, Formulates Measures to Protect the Autumn Harvest
    Editor: In order to prevent landlords and bad elements from sabotaging production and engaging in other illegal activities, the militia and township cadres of Tuqiao Township, Hengyang County, Hunan Province, have formulated measures to protect the autumn harvest. Recently, the militia of Tuqiao Township, Hengyang County, have been busy with production and have relaxed the control of landlords and the education and transformation of vagrants and bad elements. As a result, landlords are openly engaging in illegal activities, and bad elements are not abiding by the law, causing harm to many farmers. For example, Xiao Chenshi, the wife of the special agent landlord Xiao Kunwu (who has been executed), even occupied two plots of vegetable land belonging to Xiao Shifa, the leader of the eighth group, provoking disputes between the farmers of the eighth group and the group leader. On June 29, Xiao Chenshi also instigated her nephew, Xiao Desheng, to falsely accuse Xiao Shifa to the district people's government. Another example is the vagrant Xiao Deqing, who does not engage in production. When Xiao Dehui, the public security committee member of the township people's government, educated him, he refused to accept it and instead instigated the deaf-mute Xiao Shijin to dismantle Xiao Dehui's kitchen. In addition, there are other situations, such as the wives of landlords from other townships coming to seduce farmers into cohabitation, using up all the farmer's capital for production, or engaging in sabotage, etc., which are too numerous to mention. These situations are causing considerable damage to the production of Tuqiao Township. At the joint conference of the militia and township cadres of Tuqiao Township on July 14, everyone formulated measures to protect the autumn harvest in response to these situations:
    (1) Landlords must report their production situation to the militia squad leader every day, ask the militia squad leader for leave when going out, and are not allowed to go out at night; landlords are called to a meeting once every seven days for inspection. Strengthen the education and transformation of vagrants and bad elements.
    (2) Six mobile sentry posts are set up at night, and household registration is checked as a priority.
    (3) Strictly prevent landlords and special agents from poisoning, setting fire to seedlings and crops, burning granaries, harming livestock, cutting electric wires, and digging up ponds and dams; immediately expose and trace the roots of rumors.
    (4) Take appropriate measures against the wives of landlords from other townships who come to engage in sabotage. Luo Yan

    衡阳县土桥乡订出保卫秋收的办法
    编辑同志：湖南省衡阳县土桥乡，为了防止地主及坏分子破坏生产和进行其他的非法活动，民兵和乡干部们订出了保卫秋收的办法。衡阳县土桥乡的民兵们，近来因忙于生产，放松了对地主的管制和对游民、坏分子等的教育改造，因此，地主明目张胆地进行非法活动，坏分子也不安分守法，致使不少农民受到了危害。如特务地主萧昆吾（已枪决）的老婆萧陈氏竟侵占第八组组长萧世法的菜地两块，挑拨第八组农民和组长闹纠纷。六月二十九日，萧陈氏又唆使她的侄儿萧德省向区人民政府诬告萧世法。又如游民萧德庆不事生产，乡人民政府治安委员萧德惠对他进行教育，他也不接受，反唆使哑子萧世进拆毁萧德惠的灶房。另外如其他乡的地主的老婆前来勾搭农民同居，把农民准备作生产的本钱吃用一光，或者进行破坏等等情况，不胜枚举。这些情况对土桥乡的生产，都起着相当严重的破坏作用。七月十四日，土桥乡民兵和乡干部的联合大会上，大家针对这些情况订出了保卫秋收的办法：
    （一）地主每天向民兵班长报告生产情况，出门要向民兵班长请假，夜晚不准出去；七天召集地主开会一次，进行检查。加强对游民和坏分子的教育改造。（二）夜晚放流动哨六处，并重点检查户口。（三）严防地主、特务放毒、放火烧苗禾、烧粮仓、打牲畜、剪电线、挖塘坝等；发现谣言立即揭破和追根。（四）对由他乡前来进行破坏的地主的老婆，作适当处理。　罗　炎
