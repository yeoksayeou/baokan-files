    The Trade Union of the Shenyang Rolling Stock Depot, Fourth Branch of the China Changchun Railway Administration, under the leadership of the Party committee and according to the instructions of the sub-district committee, conducted a general inspection of the implementation of the production increase and economy plan in various work groups in late July. This inspection enabled leading cadres to promptly understand the problems existing in the production increase and economy movement and to improve their leadership.
    The rolling stock depot has thirty-four production groups. Based on the results of the June practice, the plans of twelve groups were considered to be relatively well-formulated. The plans of these groups were specific and comprehensive, and the results of their implementation in June all exceeded the monthly plan. For example, the Wang Shixin group in the train inspection workshop exposed and overcame many erroneous ideas when formulating their plan, recognized the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and the entire group was in high spirits. They strengthened joint labor in their work, adjusted their relationship with comrades working at the station, found many tricks, tapped potential forces, revised the patriotic pact, and established a "housekeeping account." In addition, they took the initiative to go to Sujiatun to learn Yu Deshui's method of quickly replacing brake beams; responded to the challenge of Zheng Xikun's contracted train group, and promptly launched a full-red competition. As a result, they overfulfilled their patriotic production increase and economy plan in June. The plans of seventeen groups were also good, but not specific enough, and the specific measures for completing the plan were not clear. The groups did not implement the inspection, study, and evaluation system, and some had not revised their patriotic pacts and established "housekeeping accounts." In addition, the plans of three groups did not play a guiding role in production. The reason was that ideological education had not been carried out among the workers, and the workers felt at a loss when formulating the plan. For example, the riveters thought they were roughnecks and could not find tricks, so they could just work harder. They saw that other groups had formulated plans to learn advanced experiences, and they also formulated a plan to learn the Soviet Kimoshev's method of reviving dead cars, but they did not know what the characteristics of this advanced experience were. When they could not formulate their plans, the head of the technical operation section took the unfinished plans and helped them formulate them, and only returned them during this inspection. Therefore, the work of their group was completely divorced from the plan. Their work enthusiasm was very high, and they still overfulfilled the tasks assigned by the bureau. However, because they had no clear idea in their minds, as they said themselves, they "saved more than 20 million yuan in a muddle-headed way."
    This inspection also revealed shortcomings in the work of promoting advanced experiences. The main ones were: advanced experiences were not promoted in a planned, organized, and focused manner, so as to form a mass movement. Some workers did not even know what advanced experiences there were. They said, "We have heard that there is such an advanced experience, but we are not clear about what it is all about." Other workers said, "Advanced methods are locked in the technical office, and they don't show us or teach us to learn, how can we be clear?"
    The inspection also revealed that the competition movement had not been carried out in a deep and comprehensive manner. After the plan was formulated, the competition should be launched immediately, but only 26 percent of the groups in the section launched the full-red competition and responded to the challenge of Zheng Xikun's contracted train group, and the others did not. The leadership has not yet carried out a series of mobilization and organizational work to launch the competition movement in a deep and comprehensive manner.
    The workers were very satisfied with this inspection. This inspection summarized the creativity and work achievements of the masses, improved everyone's understanding of the production increase and economy movement, and found the direction of efforts. Those groups that had not formulated their plans well or had not thoroughly implemented their plans mostly made up for their plans, and expressed their intention to catch up with the best groups in August. The leadership also studied specific ways to overcome the shortcomings in the leadership work.

    沈阳车辆段检查增产节约计划的执行情况
    中长铁路管理局第四分局沈阳车辆段工会，根据分区委员会的指示，在党委的领导下，于七月下旬普遍检查了各小组增产节约计划的执行情况。通过这次检查，使领导干部及时地了解了在增产节约运动中所存在的问题，并改进了领导工作。
    车辆段共有三十四个生产小组，从六月份的实践结果来检查，有十二个小组的计划订得比较好。这些小组的计划具体而全面，六月份实行的结果，都超额完成了月计划。例如列车检查车间的王世信小组，他们在订计划时，暴露并克服了许多错误的思想，认清了增产节约的意义，全组情绪很高。他们加强了工作中的联合劳动，调整了和车站工作同志的关系，找了很多窍门，挖出潜在力量，修订了爱国公约，建立了“管家帐”。此外，他们还主动地到苏家屯去学习于德水快速换制动梁法；向郑锡坤包车组应了战，及时开展满堂红竞赛等。因而六月份超额完成了爱国增产节约计划。有十七个组的计划，虽然也不错，但订的不够具体，完成计划的具体措施也不明确。小组没有执行检查、学习、评定制度，有的还没有修订爱国公约和建立“管家帐”。另外，有三个小组的计划没有起指导生产的作用。原因是没有对工人进行思想教育，工人在订计划时，感到无从着手。如铆工组工人认为自己是大老粗，不能找窍门，多干点活就行了。他们看见别的组里订了学习先进经验的计划，也订了一条要学习苏联基莫舍夫的死车复活法，但这项先进经验的特点是什么，他们也不知道。他们的计划订不出来，技术作业科长就把没有订完的计划拿去，帮助他们订了，直到这次检查时才送回来。因此他们小组的工作与计划完全脱了节。他们的工作热情很高，还是超额完成了局给的任务。但由于他们心中无数，像他们自己所说的那样：“稀里糊涂地省了二千多万元。”
    通过这次检查，也发现了推广先进经验工作中的缺点。其中主要的是：没有有计划、有组织、有重点地推广先进经验，使之形成群众性运动。有的工人根本还不知道有些什么先进经验，他们说：“我们听说有这样一种先进经验，但究竟是怎么回事不清楚。”还有的工人说：“先进方法被锁在技术室里，不给我们表演，也不教我们学习，我们怎么会清楚呢？”
    检查中也暴露竞赛运动没有深入地全面地开展。制订计划后，应当即时开展竞赛，但该段只有百分之二十六的小组开展了满堂红竞赛，同郑锡坤包车组应了战，其他的都没有。领导方面还没有经过一系列的动员和组织工作，深入地全面地开展竞赛运动。
    工人们对于这次的检查很满意。这一检查，总结了群众的创造和工作成绩，提高了大家对增产节约运动的认识，找出了努力的方向。那些没有订好计划或者执行计划不彻底的小组，大都作出了补课计划，表示要在八月里向最好的小组看齐。领导方面也研究了克服领导工作的缺点的具体办法。
