East China: Party Committees at All Levels Establish Specialized Agencies to Strengthen Party Leadership over Commerce

The East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the CCP Committees of all provinces (regions) and municipalities in East China have recently organized committees for urban-rural material exchange and offices for these committees. Similar institutions are also being established at the prefectural and county CCP committee levels throughout the region. This measure aims to strengthen the leadership of CCP committees over commerce and to strengthen political work in the trade and cooperative sectors.

The East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee held an enlarged meeting at the end of June, deciding that vigorously developing urban-rural material exchange and invigorating the market should be one of the central tasks for the entire Party in East China in the second half of this year. The meeting further pointed out that the key to ensuring the completion of this task lies in the Party strengthening its leadership over commerce. In order to enable the Party committees to promptly grasp the situation of material exchange, solve various related policy and ideological problems, and closely coordinate the relevant departments, the meeting decided that the Party committees of each province (region), municipality, prefecture, and county must designate specific personnel within the Party committee to be responsible for grasping trade and cooperative work. It also suggested that the commercial departments (bureaus) of the People's Governments of each province (region) and municipality establish deputy department (bureau) chiefs specifically in charge of personnel and political work, and that Party committees above the county level establish urban-rural material exchange committees and their offices to strengthen leadership.

This decision of the Enlarged Meeting of the East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee has now been gradually implemented. The East China Bureau's Urban-Rural Material Exchange Committee and its office have been established, and the Urban-Rural Material Exchange Committees and offices of the CCP Committees of various provinces (regions) and municipalities have also been established one after another. A number of prefectures and over a hundred counties where urban-rural material exchange conferences have recently been held have also established such institutions.

Since the CCP committees at all levels in East China have strengthened their leadership over commerce, the development of material exchange work in the entire East China region has become more in-depth, and markets throughout the region are rapidly returning to activity. The tendency within the Party to neglect commercial work has begun to be corrected.

The Office of the Urban-Rural Material Exchange Committee of the East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee recently discovered, based on reports from various regions, that there are still many chaotic phenomena in the primary markets of various regions regarding the relationship between public and private sectors, the implementation of price policies, and market management. Therefore, on July 16, it made more specific regulations on strengthening the Party's leadership over commerce. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华东各级党委建立专门机构
    加强党对商业的领导
    中共中央华东局和华东各省（区）、市中共党委会最近都已组织城乡物资交流委员会与委员会的办公室；全区中共地委和县委两级也正在建立同样机构。这一措施的目的是加强中共党委会对商业的领导，加强贸易和合作社部门的政治工作。
    中共中央华东局在六月底曾召开扩大会议，决定以大力展开城乡物资交流、活跃市场为今年下半年华东全党的中心任务之一。会议又指出：保证完成这一任务的关键在于党加强对商业的领导。为使党委及时掌握物资交流情况，解决各项有关政策和思想问题，使有关各部门密切配合起见，会议决定各省（区）、市及专区、县的党委会必须在党委内指定专人负责掌握贸易、合作社工作，并建议各省
    （区）、各市人民政府商业厅（局）设立专管人事与政治工作的副厅（局）长，县以上的党委会建立城乡物资交流委员会及其办公室，以加强领导。
    中共中央华东局扩大会议的这个决定，现在已经逐步实现。华东局城乡物资交流委员会及其办公室已经成立，各省（区）、市中共党委的城乡物资交流委员会和办公室也已先后建立。最近举行过城乡物资交流大会的许多专区和一百几十个县的中共党委，也有一部分设立了这样的机构。
    中共华东各级党委对商业加强领导以来，华东全区物资交流工作的发展已经更加深入；全区各地市场正迅速地重趋活跃中。党内忽视商业工作的倾向已开始纠正。
    中共中央华东局城乡物资交流委员会办公室最近根据各地报告，发现目前各地初级市场中的公私关系、价格政策的执行以及市场管理上还有不少混乱的现象，因此在七月十六日又对加强党对商业的领导问题，作出了更具体的规定。（据新华社讯）
