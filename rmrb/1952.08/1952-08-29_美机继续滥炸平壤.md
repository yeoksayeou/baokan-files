(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 28th) American aerial bandits continue to barbarously bomb peaceful cities and villages in Korea, slaughtering peaceful people. Before dawn on August 27th, more than ten American "Flying Fortresses" bombed the western district of Pyongyang eight times, dropping more than 380 heavy and time-delayed bombs, killing and wounding 58 elderly, weak, women, and children who were unable to escape in their sleep, and destroying 185 houses and cave dwellings and thousands of "ping" of farmland. This is the fourth time the western district of Pyongyang has been bombed in August, although the Korean Central News Agency has officially announced that this area has no military targets and is merely a densely populated residential and market area.

At 2:00 PM and 11:00 PM on August 27th, American planes again bombed and strafed peaceful villages near Pyongyang, destroying many houses and causing great damage to rice paddies, killing and wounding dozens of civilians.

The Korean "Workers' Newspaper" pointed out that American planes taking off from bases in Japan are constantly carrying out brutal bombings of Korean cities in order to slaughter peaceful residents. However, the American aggressors' attempt to use this atrocity to make the Korean people yield is a complete delusion.

    美机继续滥炸平壤
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】美国空中强盗继续野蛮地轰炸朝鲜的和平城市与乡村，屠杀和平人民。八月二十七日天未明前，美国“飞行堡垒”十余架轰炸平壤市西区达八次之多，投下重磅炸弹和定时炸弹三百八十多枚，炸死炸伤在睡梦中躲避不及的老弱妇孺五十八人，毁民房、土窟一百八十五所，田地数千坪。这是平壤西区在八月份中第四次被炸，虽然朝鲜中央通讯社已正式宣布，这一地区毫无军事目标，只是一个人口集中的住宅区和市场区。
    二十七日午后二时和夜间十一时，美机又轰炸和扫射平壤附近的和平村庄，许多房屋被炸毁，稻田受到很大的损害，死伤老百姓数十人。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”指出：从日本基地起飞的美机不断对朝鲜城市进行凶残的轰炸，是为了屠杀和平居民。但是美国侵略者想用这种暴行来使朝鲜人民屈膝，完全是一种妄想。
