Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, August 30th: The Logistics Department and Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army held their first Congress of Model Heroes from August 15th to 23rd. The congress summarized and exchanged experiences from all aspects of logistics work since entering Korea to fight, mobilizing further efforts to launch a campaign to achieve merits, improve work efficiency, and strengthen logistics work in modern warfare. The congress was attended by 127 Model Heroes representing various departments and units under the Logistics Department, and 17 non-voting delegates. 21 Model Heroes from logistics work within the Volunteer Army's combat units were invited to attend the congress. In nearly two years, Volunteer Army logistics personnel, with great courage, initiative, and creativity, overcame the enemy's frantic air and artillery attacks and blockades, as well as natural difficulties such as heavy snow and floods. They built a steel-like transportation line from the Yalu River to near the 38th parallel, delivering countless weapons, ammunition, food, and other supplies supported by the people of the motherland to the front lines without interruption, ensuring timely and sufficient war supplies, and effectively completing the task of treating and transferring the wounded. After the American aggressors launched their heinous germ warfare on the Korean battlefield, medical and epidemic prevention personnel mobilized all their forces and cooperated with the combat troops to successfully crush the enemy's germ warfare, creating many experiences in epidemic prevention and hygiene work. In tense and complex work and struggles, the Volunteer Army's logistics forces have grown stronger day by day and have reached the requirements suitable for modern warfare.

In the glorious and arduous struggle, the Volunteer Army's logistics personnel widely launched a revolutionary heroism campaign to achieve merits. Under the slogan of "Adding glory to Chairman Mao and making contributions to the people of the motherland and the people of the world," they worked and fought selflessly. According to incomplete statistics, the logistics departments have produced 110 collective meritorious units and 17,969 people's heroes and model workers, of which 6,412 are members of the Chinese Communist Party and 4,789 are members of the New Democratic Youth League. Among these Model Heroes, model driver Wu Shouyi safely drove two vehicles for 54,000 kilometers; engineering model commander Zhang Zhenzhi led a platoon to complete the task of repairing a culvert in six and a half hours, originally scheduled for twenty-four hours; Ding Cheng, model squad leader of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, directed the entire squad to hit five enemy planes in one day of air combat; Zhang Mingqi, squad leader of a certain anti-aircraft unit, led his entire squad to guard the transportation line every day, and shot down an enemy plane and captured eight enemy agents; Li Dexue, deputy squad leader of a communication squad, disregarded his life and successively carried away four time bombs and eight Fenglei bombs, ensuring the safety of the transportation line, and rescued materials, Korean people, and wounded personnel under enemy air raids and strafing many times; Wang Shiming, first-class meritorious hero and warehouse keeper, has consistently worked actively and saved a large amount of materials for the motherland; model nursing workers Liu Xiuzhen and Jiang Shuhua bravely rescued wounded soldiers under enemy air raids and strafing, and are therefore known throughout the country.

Commander Hong Xuezhi of the Logistics Department gave a report on the situation and tasks to the congress. Li Xuesan, director of the Logistics Political Department, gave instructions on further launching the campaign to achieve merits. Li Xuesan called on all departments to launch a broader campaign to achieve merits, create more model units of collective meritorious service, and cultivate more heroes and models. Feng Cun, a representative of the Volunteer Army returning to China, reported on the situation of the people of the motherland launching the movement to increase production and practice economy, and fully supporting the Volunteer Army.

The Model Heroes and representatives enthusiastically discussed various reports during the meeting and exchanged various experiences in detail. Eighteen Model Heroes and models gave typical reports at the congress. They unanimously stated that they would maintain and carry forward their glory, remain modest and prudent, actively lead the masses, and complete the four tasks instructed by Commander Hong Xuezhi. The congress also sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to express their respect, thank the people of the motherland for their care and strong support, and express their determination to fight to the end for the final victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.
