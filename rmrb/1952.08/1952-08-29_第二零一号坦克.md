    Tank No. 201
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Lu Yun
    Tank No. 201 is one of the many tanks donated by the people of the motherland to the Chinese People's Volunteers. The tank crew of this tank—commander Meng Xianbao, driver Wang Zhicheng, gunner Wang Jinkai, machine gunner Li Jintang, and loader Qi Shusen—were originally soldiers in the infantry units of the Chinese People's Volunteers. During the difficult days of the initial entry into Korea, they witnessed with their own eyes many houses and crops of the Korean people being crushed and destroyed by the U.S. aggressor's tanks, and many Korean elderly, women, and children being crushed to death under the enemy tanks' tracks. At that time, they gritted their teeth and thought, "One day we will use our own tanks to eliminate these brutal enemies. How satisfying that will be!" After the movement to donate weapons by the people of the motherland was launched, their wish came true—they were transferred to receive tank training in the autumn of last year. After only a little more than a month of study, they drove the huge tanks donated by the people of the motherland, crossed the Yalu River, and climbed and waded to the front lines of the Imjin River. When many tanks appeared on the front lines, they aroused warm cheers from the infantry soldiers.
    At that time, our army on the Imjin River front was engaged in a fierce battle for the Ma Liang Mountain position with the enemy. Tank No. 201 and other tanks appeared on the fire line of Ma Liang Mountain on the third day of the battle.
    The British 29th Brigade, which had suffered nearly a thousand casualties in the first two days of the offensive, concentrated more than 20 tanks on this day to bombard our army's forward positions, and used two tanks to cover a company of infantry as they approached a prominent high ground southwest of our army's main position. Those two tanks were large and clumsy, British "Centurion" - type heavy tanks. They strutted and swaggered all the way to about 200 meters in front of our army's position.
    At this time, our army headquarters decided to give this group of enemies a heavy blow. As soon as the order was transmitted to the combat troops, our army's various artillery pieces suddenly bombarded the enemy. Tank No. 201, which was waiting with other tanks, also received an order to cover the infantry's attack. The driver immediately turned on the switch and increased the throttle, and the tank roared out of the position, detouring to the enemy tanks' flanks. It crossed the small river and moved forward undulatingly on the uneven open ground. Tank commander Meng Xianbao looked back through the tank's observation hole: infantry comrades were following closely behind his tank, advancing through the dust raised by the tracks. He couldn't suppress the joy in his heart for a moment, and shouted loudly to the tank crew in the car: "This is the first time we are driving tanks to attack the enemy; for the motherland, and to avenge the Korean people, we must fight hard!" The turret of Tank No. 201 rotated rapidly, and immediately continuously fired shells at the enemy tanks.
    British generals had brazenly boasted about the power of their "Centurion" heavy tanks, but when these two tanks encountered the fierce attack of the Chinese People's Volunteers' tanks, they hurriedly released a burst of smoke and slipped away. The enemy's infantry company that was following behind the "Centurions" had already suffered heavy casualties from our army's sudden artillery fire during their advance, and at this time they lost the cover of the tanks, so they were immediately thrown into chaos. Tank No. 201 immediately bravely rushed into this chaotic enemy group, firing fierce machine gun fire at them. The five Chinese People's Volunteers automatic riflemen standing on the tank deck jumped out of the car and swept the enemy with automatic rifle fire after the tank rushed into the enemy group. In this way, after only twenty minutes of combat, an English company was completely annihilated.
    Filled with the joy of the initial victory, the tank crew of Tank No. 201 were ordered on November 4 to cooperate with the brave infantry warriors to counterattack the enemy on Ma Liang Mountain. This counterattack was an outstanding example of the combined operations of the Chinese People's Volunteers' powerful artillery, infantry, and tank forces. At 3:00 p.m., our army's various calibers of artillery conducted a fierce bombardment of the enemy's positions. When the infantry units launched an assault after the artillery fire extended to the enemy's deep positions, our army's tanks quickly drove out of the positions, following the attack route to cover the advance of the infantry comrades. At this time, twelve enemy planes flew into the sky to block our army's operations, but they immediately encountered the fire of our army's anti-aircraft artillery units. The fierce anti-aircraft artillery fire formed a dense fire net in the air, forcing the enemy planes to dare not dive and fly low, and they had to drop bombs blindly and escape. At that time, Tank No. 201 had calmly driven past the barbed wire in front of the enemy's position, covering the infantry warriors as they charged up the steep slopes of Ma Liang Mountain, and then continued to cover the infantry with fierce machine gun fire as they charged towards the top of the mountain.
    At this moment, three enemy tanks detoured from the right side of Ma Liang Mountain, using their tank guns to bombard our army's assault team that was approaching the top of the mountain, attempting to block their advance. At this critical moment, Tank No. 201 immediately maneuvered around a mound, bravely met them, and engaged the enemy tanks in a fierce artillery battle. Gunner Wang Jinkai pressed the button, and shells whistled towards the enemy tanks. Loader Qi Shusen, shirtless and covered in sweat,不停地把炮弹填进炮膛。 The turret was filled with the choking smell of gunpowder, but the gunner still不停地向敌军坦克发射着炮弹。 Our army's long-range artillery and brother tanks also provided fire support. The enemy tanks could not withstand the attack, hurriedly counterattacked for a while, and then fled with numerous wounds. At this time, signal flares indicating that our army had occupied the position rose from Ma Liang Mountain, and all three companies of the defending British army were annihilated. The tank crew members leaned out of the turret, waving their hats to cheer and salute the infantry warriors, and the infantry warriors also waved their hats to salute the heroic tank crew members. A song of victory rang out on the position, and the tank crew members happily sang: "The artillery roars, the machine guns swing, the iron fortress charges and rampages, pioneering the way! …."
    The young and brave Chinese People's Volunteers' tank crew members have since begun their glorious combat life. They quickly mastered modern combat technology, not only learning to use the power of tanks in offense, but also learning to use various flexible means in defensive operations to打击着来犯的敌人。 They sometimes used突发的炮火 to destroy the enemy exposed on the ground; sometimes they drove tanks to the enemy's front positions, destroying the enemy's bunkers and firepower points; sometimes they even suddenly appeared in places where the enemy did not expect, ambushing the enemy's tanks and infantry.
    The tank crew members of Tank No. 201 and other brother tanks fought day and night on the Imjin River front, relentlessly打击着敌人 in coordination with the infantry units. In nearly ten months, Tank No. 201 has destroyed many of the enemy's firepower points and many bunkers, destroyed and damaged three enemy tanks, and coordinated with the infantry to capture seven mountain ridges. Therefore, it has荣膺了 three award flags and立了 two collective Second Class Merits. The infantry soldiers at the front line call the tank crew members "our closest comrades-in-arms." The young tank crew members said, "We should thank the people of the motherland for donating such good tanks to us. We must win even greater victories to thank the people of the motherland."

    第二零一号坦克
    新华社记者　路云
    第二零一号坦克，是祖国人民捐献给志愿军的许多坦克中的一辆。这辆坦克的坦克手——车长孟献保、驾驶员王治成、炮长王金凯、机枪手李金堂和装填手齐树森，原来都是志愿军步兵部队里的战士。在入朝初期的那些艰苦战斗的日子里，他们亲眼看到朝鲜人民的许多房屋、庄稼被美国侵略军的坦克碾倒压坏，不少朝鲜老人、妇女和儿童被碾死在敌人坦克的履带下。那时他们就咬着牙想过：“我们终有一天要用自己的坦克去消灭这些残暴的敌人的，到那时候该是多么痛快啊！”祖国人民捐献武器运动发起以后，他们的愿望实现了——在去年秋天被调去受坦克手的训练。他们仅仅经过一个多月的学习，便驾驶着祖国人民捐献的巨大的坦克，渡过鸭绿江，爬坡涉水地来到了临津江前线。当许多坦克一出现在火线上，就引起步兵战士们的热烈欢呼。
    那时候，临津江前线的我军正与敌军在马良山阵地上进行着激烈的争夺战。第二零一号坦克和其他坦克出现在马良山的火线上，是在该地战斗的第三天。
    在前两天进攻中被我军杀伤近千人的英军第二十九旅，这一天集中了二十多辆坦克来轰击我军的前沿阵地，并以两辆坦克掩护着一个步兵连向我军主阵地西南的一个突出高地逼进。那两辆坦克的个儿又大又笨，是英国“百人队长”——逊立伦式的重型坦克。它们耀武扬威地一直冲到了我军阵地前面大约二百公尺处。
    这时候，我军指挥部决定给这伙敌人一个狠狠的打击。当命令一传到战斗部队，我军的各种炮火便向敌人突然轰击。正在与其他坦克一起待命的第二零一号坦克，也接到了掩护步兵出击的命令。驾驶员立即拉开电钮和开大了油门，坦克就轰鸣着驶出阵地，向敌人坦克的侧翼迂回过去。它越过小河，在高低不平的开阔地上起伏前进。车长孟献保从坦克的了望孔向后看去：步兵战友们正冒着履带扬起的尘土紧跟在他的坦克后面跃进。他一时无法抑止心中的狂喜，大声地向车中的坦克手们喊着：“这是我们第一次驾着坦克去打击敌人；为了祖国，为了给朝鲜人民复仇，我们要狠狠地打啊！”第二零一号坦克的炮塔急速地转动起来，马上连续不断地向敌人的坦克发射着炮弹。
    英国将军们曾经大言不惭地吹嘘过他们“百人队长”式重型坦克的威力，可是，这两辆坦克一逢到了志愿军坦克的猛袭，慌忙地施放出一阵烟幕溜跑了。原来跟在“百人队长”后面的敌人的一个步兵连队，在前进时已被我军突发的炮火杀伤了一大批，这时又失去了坦克的掩护，因此顿时乱作一团。第二零一号坦克立即勇猛地冲进这股混乱的敌群，向他们放射猛烈的机关枪火。站在坦克甲板上的五名志愿军自动枪手，当坦克冲进敌群后，就跳下车来用自动枪火扫射敌人。这样，只战斗了二十几分钟，英军的一个连队就被全部歼灭了。
    第二零一号坦克的坦克手们怀着初战胜利的喜悦，又在十一月四日奉命配合步兵勇士们反击马良山上的敌人。这次反击，是志愿军强大炮兵、步兵和坦克兵联合作战的杰出战例。下午三点钟，我军各种口径的炮向敌军阵地进行猛烈轰击。当步兵部队在炮火向敌人纵深阵地进行延伸射击后发起冲锋。我军的坦克迅速驶出阵地，循着出击道路掩护步兵战友们前进。这时，十二架敌机飞到上空来拦阻我军的作战行动，但立即遇到了我军高射炮部队的射击。猛烈的高射炮火在空中组成了严密的火网，迫使敌机不敢俯冲和低飞，只得赶紧盲目地投下炸弹后逃走。当时第二零一号坦克已沉着地驶过敌人阵前的铁丝网，掩护着步兵战士们冲上马良山陡峭的山坡，接着又继续以炽烈的机关枪火掩护着步兵向山顶冲去。
    正在这时，敌人的三辆坦克从马良山的右侧迂回过来，它用坦克炮轰击已迫近山顶的我军的突击队员，企图挡住他们前进。在这紧要的关头，第二零一号坦克立即机动地绕过一个土岗，勇猛地迎击上去，与敌人的坦克展开了激烈的炮战。炮长王金凯按动电钮，炮弹呼啸着向敌人的坦克飞去。装填手齐树森光着膀子，浑身流着大汗，不停地把炮弹填进炮膛。炮塔里充满着呛人的火药味，但炮长仍然不停地向敌军坦克发射着炮弹。我军的远射程大炮和兄弟坦克也以炮火支援。敌人的坦克招架不住，慌忙地还击了一阵，便带着累累的伤痕逃走了。这时马良山上升起了我军占领阵地的信号弹，守敌英军三个连全部被歼灭了。坦克手们从炮塔里探出身子来挥舞着帽子，向步兵勇士们欢呼致敬，步兵勇士们也挥舞着帽子，向英勇的坦克手们致敬。阵地上响起胜利的歌曲，坦克手们快乐地唱道：“炮声吼鸣，机枪摆动，铁的堡垒横冲直闯，开路打先锋！………。”
    年青而勇敢的志愿军坦克手们从此开始了自己光荣的战斗生活。他们迅速地掌握了现代化作战技术，不仅学会了在进攻中发扬坦克的威力，而且学会了在阵地防御作战中运用各种灵活手段打击着来犯的敌人。他们有时以突发的炮火破坏暴露在地面的敌人；有时将坦克开到敌人的阵地前沿，摧毁敌人的地堡和火力点；有时竟突然出现在敌人料想不到的地方，伏击敌人的坦克和步兵。
    第二零一号坦克和其他兄弟坦克的坦克手们，日日夜夜地战斗在临津江前线上，配合步兵部队无情地打击着敌人。在将近十个月的时间中，第二零一号坦克已摧毁了敌人许多火力点和许多地堡，击毁击伤敌军坦克三辆，并配合步兵攻占了七座山岭。因而荣膺了三面奖旗和立了两次集体二等功。前线的步兵战士们把坦克手们称作“我们最亲密的战友”。青年的坦克手们说：“我们应该感谢祖国人民，感谢他们给我们捐献了这样好的坦克。我们一定要打更大的胜仗来答谢祖国人民。”
