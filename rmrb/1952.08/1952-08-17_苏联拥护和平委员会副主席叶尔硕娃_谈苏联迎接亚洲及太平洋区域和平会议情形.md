Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed Yelyutina, Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, on the 13th. She spoke about the Soviet people's preparations for the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, stating:

    The Soviet people are extremely concerned about the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Undoubtedly, this conference is an important milestone in expanding and consolidating the international movement to defend peace.

    The Soviet people are the most peace-loving people. The Soviet people do not want war. They do not threaten anyone and are not preparing to attack anyone. Our people are devoting all their efforts to peaceful construction and strengthening the power of the motherland, because they know that the stronger the Soviet Union, the more consolidated the cause of world peace.

    The Soviet people, nurtured in the spirit of Lenin-Stalin proletarian internationalism, respect the rights and sovereignty of other nations and have always been willing to live peacefully and amicably with the people of all countries. This is why the Soviet people and all freedom-loving people in the world are angrily opposed to the US imperialist policy of enslaving people, especially enslaving the people of Asian and Pacific countries, a policy aimed at dragging the people of all countries into a new world war. This is why the Soviet people warmly support the just struggle of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions for national independence and state sovereignty, against foreign occupation, and against the use of the people and wealth of these countries to launch a new world war.

    The Soviet people support the declaration of the Beijing Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The upcoming peace conference will discuss the Korean issue and the Japanese issue.

    The Soviet people give great sympathy and praise to the heroic struggle of the Korean people for independence, and to the selfless brotherly assistance given by the glorious sons of New China to the Korean people in this just cause. How our people treat the struggle of the Korean people can be judged by our newspapers and periodicals. Large and small gatherings have been held all over the Soviet Union, at which the Soviet people have expressed their great anger and protest against the bloody atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea, against the American aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, and against the appalling torture and torment of prisoners of war on Koje Island and Busan. The American aggressors' indiscriminate bombing of peaceful targets in Korea and China, the atrocities of destroying Pyongyang and other cities in North Korea, and the destruction of Korean cultural treasures show the world that the war instigators do not want any standards of international law, any international agreements or conventions.

    The Soviet Peace Committee receives hundreds of letters every day from Soviet workers, collective farmers, students, and housewives protesting the American aggressors' atrocities in Korea and demanding a peaceful solution to the Korean issue based on the resolutions of the Berlin Special Session of the World Peace Council. The workers of the Karelian-Finnish Republic's paper mill wrote to the Soviet Peace Committee: "We gather and call with millions of progressive people around the world to condemn the new atrocities of the American soldiers in the prisoner-of-war camps in Korea. The bloody atrocities of the American warlords are endless. When we heard about the Koje Island incident, everyone was filled with anger. The American warlords are unable to subdue the heroic people in Korea and vent their anger on prisoners of war who cannot defend themselves. The people of peace will stop the bloody hands of the criminals."

    This is the voice of all the Soviet people. Therefore, the Soviet people support the raising of the issue of a peaceful solution to the Korean War at the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

    The Japanese issue is a very important issue for our people. Japan was an ally of Hitler's Germany in World War II, in which it caused great losses to the Soviet Union and China. Therefore, the Soviet people are concerned with making Japan not a militaristic country, but a democratic and peace-loving country. Our people warmly support the resolution of the World Peace Council against the remilitarization of Japan and for a democratic Japan, and also support the struggle of the Japanese people against the traitorous and unjust San Francisco unilateral treaty and the so-called Japan-US Administrative Agreement, which are unjust treaties that damage Japan's vital interests and damage their desire for peaceful coexistence with other countries, and are forcibly imposed on the Japanese people. Everywhere there is a growing movement to strive for a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan signed by all relevant countries.

    At present, in order to enslave the people of other countries, American imperialism is attempting to establish a Pacific alliance as an aggressive tool to provoke new wars. The American aggressors openly say that the Pacific Pact will help them suppress the national liberation movements in Asia and the Pacific countries. But the people of these countries have their own views on this pact, and they are actively joining the struggle against the aggressive plans of the American aggressors. The struggle of the people of these countries for independence is receiving the warm sympathy of the Soviet people.

    Among the topics to be discussed at this peace conference is the issue of strengthening economic and cultural cooperation between the people of Asian and Pacific countries. The Soviet people have always advocated strengthening economic and cultural ties with other countries, including Asian and Pacific countries, on the basis of national independence, autonomy, and mutual benefit. The people of the whole world, like our people, express anger at the economic discrimination, embargoes, and blockade policies pursued by the United States against China and other countries.

    The Soviet people advocate economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the people of all countries. The International Economic Conference held in Moscow not long ago proved this point.

    All the issues on the agenda of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference are being widely discussed in our newspapers, on the radio, and at meetings. The Central Asian republics of the Soviet Union are particularly concerned about these issues. Comrade Khodzhayev, Chairman of the Peace Committee of the Uzbek Republic, reported to the Soviet Peace Committee that many collective farms and factories in the republic held meetings and report meetings on the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. He himself participated in the preparatory meeting in Beijing, reported on the work of the preparatory meeting at dozens of conferences, and talked about the future peace conference. Not long ago, he published a long article on this issue in Labor Daily.

    Comrade Grusenko, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and biologist, who participated in the preparatory meeting, gave a broadcast about the work of the preparatory meeting and about the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in September.

    Many members of the Soviet Peace Committee have published statements on the peace conference in newspapers and on the radio.

    The Soviet people are very concerned about how other countries are preparing for the peace conference. Our peace fighters are very concerned about the "Asia Week" organized by the All-India Peace Council, during which preparations for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will be carried out. Tikhonov sent a telegram on behalf of the Soviet Peace Committee to the All-India Peace Council to congratulate them.

    The tremendous work done by various countries to convene this peace conference proves that the people who defend peace regard this conference as a major event, which will help restrain the crazy war instigators and will prevent the realization of their evil plans. The Soviet people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, will dedicate everything to consolidating peace and preventing a new war.

    苏联拥护和平委员会副主席叶尔硕娃
    谈苏联迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议情形
    【本报讯】据新华社莫斯科十六日电：新华社记者十三日访问了苏联拥护和平委员会副主席叶尔硕娃，她就苏联人民迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的情形发表谈话称：
    苏联人民极为关怀就要来临的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。无疑的，这次会议是扩大和巩固国际保卫和平运动的重要里程碑。
    苏联人是最爱好和平的人。苏联人民不要战争。他们不威胁谁，也不准备进攻谁。我国人民全力进行和平建设，巩固祖国威力，因为他们知道，苏联越强大，世界和平事业就越巩固。
    以列宁斯大林无产阶级国际主义精神教养出来的苏联人民，尊重别国人民的权利和主权，一向愿意同世界各国人民和平和友好地相处。这就是为什么苏联人民和世界上所有爱好自由的人们愤怒地反对美帝国主义所实行的奴役人民特别是奴役亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的侵略政策，这一政策旨在把各国人民拉到新的世界大战中去。这就是为什么苏联人民热烈支持亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的正义斗争，这个斗争是为了反对外国占领，争取民族独立和国家主权，反对利用这些国家的人民和财富来发动新的世界大战。
    苏联人民支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议北京筹备会议的宣言。即将到来的和平会议将讨论朝鲜问题和日本问题。
    苏联人民对于朝鲜人民争取独立的英勇斗争，对于新中国的光荣儿子在这一正义事业上对朝鲜人民大公无私的兄弟援助的功绩，给以巨大的同情和赞扬。我们的人民怎样对待朝鲜人民的斗争，可以由我们的报刊来判断。苏联全国到处举行了大小集会，会上苏联人民表示了自己的极大愤怒和抗议，反对美国侵略者在朝鲜的血腥暴行，反对美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，反对骇人听闻地拷打和折磨巨济岛和釜山的战俘。美国侵略者对朝鲜和中国境内和平目标的滥炸，炸毁平壤和北朝鲜其他城市的暴行，以及对朝鲜文化宝物的破坏，向全世界表明：战争挑拨者不要任何标准的国际公法，不要任何国际协定和公约。
    苏联拥护和平委员会每天收到几百封苏联工人、集体农民、学生和家庭主妇的来信，他们抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜的兽行，并且要求根据世界和平理事会柏林特别会议的决议来和平解决朝鲜问题。卡累利阿—芬兰共和国的造纸联合工厂的男女工人给苏联拥护和平委员会的信说：我们集会和世界千百万进步人类一起呼吁，斥责美国军人在朝鲜对战俘营的新暴行。美国军阀的血腥暴行是无止境的。当我们听见巨济岛事件时，人人愤怒填膺。美国军阀无力在朝鲜使英勇的人民屈服，而向无法自卫的战俘泄愤。和平的人民将制止住凶犯的血腥的手。
    这是全苏联人民的呼声。因此苏联人民支持在就要来临的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上提出和平解决朝鲜战争的问题。
    日本问题对我国人民说来是很重要的问题。日本在第二次世界大战中是希特勒德国的盟国，在这个战争中它给苏联和中国造成很大的损失。因此苏联人民关心使日本不成为一个军国主义的而成为民主的爱好和平的国家。我国人民热烈地支持世界和平理事会关于反对日本重新军国主义化，争取民主的日本的决议，也支持日本人民反对卖国的非正义的旧金山片面和约和所谓日美行政协定的斗争，这些条约是非正义的，是损害日本切身利益和损害他们和其他各国人民和平共居的愿望的，是硬加在日本人民头上的条约。到处在增长着争取由一切有关国家签订的全面的公正的对日和约的运动。
    目前，美国帝国主义为了奴役他国人民，企图建立太平洋联盟，作为挑起新战争的侵略工具。美国侵略者公开说，太平洋公约将帮助他们镇压亚洲和太平洋各国的民族解放运动。但是这些国家的人民对这个公约有自己的看法，他们积极加入反对美国侵略者的侵略计划的斗争。这些国家的人民争取独立的斗争，获得苏联人民的热烈同情。
    这次和平会议讨论的题目中有关于加强亚洲及太平洋各国人民之间经济和文化的合作的问题。苏联人民向来主张和其他各国，包括亚洲及太平洋各国，在各国人民独立自主和互利的基础上，加强经济和文化联系。全世界人民和我国人民一样，对于美国对中国和其他国家所进行的经济歧视、禁运和封锁政策表示愤怒。
    苏联人民主张各国人民之间有经济合作和文化交流。不久前在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议证明了这一点。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议议程上的一切问题，在我国的报刊上、广播上、会议上广泛地讨论着。苏联中亚细亚各共和国对这些问题特别关怀。乌兹别克共和国拥护和平委员会主席贺捷耶夫向苏联拥护和平委员会报告说，共和国的许多集体农场和工厂举行了关于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的集会和报告会，他自己参加过北京的筹备会议，曾经在几十个大会上报告筹备会议工作并且讲述了未来的和平会议。不久前，他在劳动报上发表了关于这个问题的长文。
    参加过筹备会议的苏联科学院通讯院士、生物学家格鲁森科作了关于筹备会议的工作和关于将在九月间召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的广播。
    苏联拥护和平委员会的许多委员在报纸上和广播中发表了关于和平会议的言论。
    苏联人民很关心其他国家怎样准备和平会议的。我国的和平战士们很关心全印和平理事会所组织的“亚洲周”，在这一周内要进行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的准备工作。吉洪诺夫曾代表苏联拥护和平委员会致电全印和平理事会祝贺。
    各国对于召集这次和平会议所进行的巨大的工作证明了：保卫和平的人们把这次会议当作一个重大事件，它将有助于抑制疯狂的战争挑拨者，将会阻止他们罪恶计划的实现。苏联人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，将为巩固和平和阻止新战争献出自己的一切。
