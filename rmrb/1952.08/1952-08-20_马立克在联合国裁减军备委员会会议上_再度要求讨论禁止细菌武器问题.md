Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 19th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission held a meeting on August 15th. The meeting was originally scheduled to discuss the "supplementary proposal" put forward by the United States, Britain, and France on the 12th. However, the United States representative, at the very beginning of the meeting, spoke at length, explaining why the United States has not yet ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons. He continued to use the same old American propaganda, flatly denying the fact that American armed forces have used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. This kind of speech by the United States representative clearly violated the rules adopted by the US-British bloc themselves in the Commission meeting in March. At that time, the Soviet delegation had suggested that the UN Disarmament Commission discuss the issue of violating the ban on bacteriological warfare, prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, and punishing those who violate the ban on bacteriological warfare, but the Commission, under pressure from the United States, decided not to discuss this issue.

Soviet representative Malik pointed out in his speech: The statement made by the United States representative at this meeting on the issue of bacteriological warfare can only be regarded as a belated reaction to the failure suffered by the United States at the 18th International Red Cross Conference in Toronto. Everyone knows that the International Red Cross Conference recently passed a resolution, formally stating in the resolution that bacteriological weapons are one of the most serious threats facing mankind. The resolution called on national Red Cross societies to appeal to the governments of countries that have not yet ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, demanding that they immediately join and ratify this protocol. The target of the International Red Cross Conference's demand for early participation and ratification of the Geneva Protocol is precisely the United States government! The American representatives attending the conference used all their strength to try to obstruct the passage of this resolution, but they suffered failure. The resolution was passed. Now, because the United States is obstructing the Security Council from passing the Soviet proposal asking the Security Council to call on all countries that have not yet acceded to and ratified the Geneva Protocol to accede to and ratify this protocol; because the United States and the US-British bloc do not allow representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend Security Council meetings and do not give them the opportunity to present concrete facts proving the crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out bacteriological warfare in Korea and China; due to the above-mentioned resolution being passed in Toronto; the United States is in a very unfavorable political position, and has exposed its true face of opposing the prohibition of bacteriological warfare in front of the people of the world. In this political situation, the United States representative had to speak at the United Nations Disarmament Commission—unfortunately too late—trying to explain, defend, and conceal the United States' attitude of refusing to ratify the Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. But this kind of speech is of no use, because the people of the world clearly know that the ruling circles of the United States not only have not ratified the Geneva Protocol, not only oppose the United Nations calling on all countries to participate in and ratify this protocol, but now have embarked on the road of obstructing the implementation of the resolution passed by the 18th International Red Cross Conference. After the American representative delivered his speech, even his colleagues in private conversations considered this speech to be very strange and inappropriate. This assessment is undoubtedly correct.

Malik pointed out that at the Red Cross Conference, the delegation of the People's Republic of China presented concrete and irrefutable evidence proving that the American aggressors were conducting bacteriological warfare against China and Korea, proving that the American armed forces were using bacteriological weapons against the Chinese and Korean people. This American act of violating the Geneva Protocol has forced world public opinion and the United Nations to pay attention to this situation, to demand that the United States ratify the Geneva Protocol it signed, and to demand that the United States guarantee that it will no longer use bacteriological weapons.

Malik said: Since the American representative has once again raised the issue of bacteriological weapons at the United Nations Disarmament Commission, the Soviet delegation formally suggests that the Commission accept the topic initially proposed by the Soviet delegation—to examine the issue of violating the ban on bacteriological warfare, prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, and punishing those who violate the ban on bacteriological warfare, and to begin discussing this topic. If the United States representative opposes the Soviet proposal, there can only be one explanation: the United States government wants to maintain the freedom to further use inhumane bacteriological weapons.

### 马立克在联合国裁减军备委员会会议上  再度要求讨论禁止细菌武器问题

    马立克在联合国裁减军备委员会会议上
    再度要求讨论禁止细菌武器问题
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国裁减军备委员会于八月十五日举行会议。会议原来要讨论美英法三国于十二日提出的“补充提案”。但是美国代表在会议一开始后，就首先发言，冗长地解释为什么美国到现在还没有批准禁止使用细菌武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书。他仍是用美国宣传的滥调，矢口否认美国武装部队在朝鲜与中国使用细菌武器的事实。美国代表这样的发言显然违反了美英集团自己在三月中在委员会会议上通过的规则。当时苏联代表团曾建议联合国裁军委员会讨论关于破坏细菌战禁令、禁止使用细菌武器和惩罚细菌战禁令违反者的问题，但是委员会在美国压力下决定不讨论这个问题。
    苏联代表马立克发言指出：只能够把美国代表在这次会议上发表的关于细菌战问题的声明，认为是对美国在多伦多第十八届国际红十字大会所遭到的失败的为时已晚的反应。大家都知道，国际红十字大会最近通过了一个决议，并在决议中正式表示细菌武器是人类所面临的最严重的威胁之一。决议号召各国红十字会，向还没有批准一九二五年关于禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的各国政府呼吁，要求它们立即参加并批准这个议定书。国际红十字大会要求尽早参加并批准日内瓦议定书的对象正是美国政府！列席大会的美国代表用尽了一切力量，企图阻挠这个决议的通过，但是他们遭受了失败。决议通过了。现在，由于美国阻挠安全理事会通过苏联的要求安全理事会号召所有尚未参加和批准日内瓦议定书的国家参加和批准这个议定书的建议；由于美国和美英集团不允许中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表出席安全理事会会议，并不给他们以陈述具体事实证实美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行的机会；由于上述决议在多伦多获得通过；美国在政治上已处于非常不利的地位，而且已经在全世界人民面前暴露了它反对禁止细菌战的真面目。在这种政治局势下，美国代表不得不在联合国裁军委员会上发言——可惜为时已晚——极力解释、申辩并掩饰美国拒绝批准关于禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的态度。但是这一类的演说是起不了什么作用的，因为全世界人民很清楚地知道：美国统治集团不仅没有批准日内瓦议定书，不仅反对联合国向各国呼吁、要求它们参加并批准这个议定书，而且现在已经走上了阻挠第十八届国际红十字大会所通过的决议之实现的道路。在美国代表发表演说以后，甚至他的同道们在私人谈话中也认为这个演说很奇怪而且不合时宜。这种估计无疑是正确的。
    马立克指出：在红十字大会会议上，中华人民共和国代表团提出了具体的、无可辩驳的证据，证明美国侵略者对中国和朝鲜进行细菌战，证明美国武装部队对中朝人民使用细菌武器。美国这种破坏日内瓦议定书的行为，迫使世界公众和联合国要求注意这种情况，要求美国批准它所签订的日内瓦议定书，要求美国保证不再使用细菌武器。
    马立克说：既然美国代表在联合国裁军委员会上再度提出了细菌武器问题，苏联代表团就正式建议委员会接受苏联代表团一开始就提出的议题——审议关于破坏细菌战禁令、禁止使用细菌武器以及惩罚细菌战禁令违反者的问题，并开始讨论这个议题。如果美国代表反对苏联的建议，那就只能有一个解释：美国政府想保持进一步使用惨无人道的细菌武器的自由。
