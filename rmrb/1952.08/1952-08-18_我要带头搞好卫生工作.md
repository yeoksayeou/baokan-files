    I want to take the lead in improving sanitation work
    Editor: I am a family member of Zhu Guanghui, a meritorious person from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. While commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, I thought of our happy life and also of the ugly crimes of the American bandits who spread bacteria in Korea and China, attempting to kill the peace-loving people of Korea and China. I am a sanitation worker. I want to respond to the government's call to launch a patriotic health campaign, actively promote it in the area where I live, and participate in well repairs and mosquito and fly eradication, as a gift to the "August 1st" holiday!

    我要带头搞好卫生工作
    编辑同志：我是中国人民解放军某部功臣朱光辉的家属。当纪念“八一”建军节二十五周年的时候，我想到我们的幸福生活，也想到美国强盗在朝中两国撒布细菌、妄图杀害朝中和平人民的丑恶罪行。我是一个卫生工作者。我要响应人民政府关于开展爱国卫生运动的号召，在我居住的地区努力进行宣传，并参加修水井、扑灭蚊子、苍蝇等工作，作为对“八一”节的献礼！
    北京市崇文门外东珠市口十六号  朱诗正
