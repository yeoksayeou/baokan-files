The college graduates of the country who are graduating this summer, under the unified allocation of the People's Government, are about to step onto their work posts and participate in the country's construction work. This is of great significance for the upcoming large-scale construction of our country.

In the past two years, about 40,000 graduates from colleges and universities in our country have been planned and allocated by the People's Government to various construction posts in the country, becoming builders of the new China. They have been tempered in their work, and have made great progress politically, ideologically, and professionally. A very small number of people have been assigned jobs that are not appropriate and do not conform to the principle of combining learning with application. The People's Government is inspecting and adjusting these. Some graduates have special difficulties, and have generally received necessary care. The suffering of "graduation equals unemployment" that students in old China endured has been eliminated forever. This enables all college graduates to actively and happily serve the new motherland and serve the people.

Although the number of college graduates this summer is greater than in previous years, it is still far from meeting the needs of the scale of construction work that our country is about to begin. The State Council of the Central People's Government has determined that the basic principle of this year's unified allocation of college graduates is centralized use and key deployment, first to meet the needs of capital construction as much as possible, and secondly to strengthen education construction and scientific research work. This policy is correct and fully conforms to the current situation in our country. Economic construction is the primary task of our country in the future, and capital construction work in economic construction is the central link of the entire economic construction work. Therefore, it is very necessary to concentrate a large number of graduates from science, engineering, and economics to factories, mines, transportation, and water conservancy projects. At the same time, from the long-term needs of national construction, we must also train a large number of cadres and strengthen scientific research related to national defense and economic construction. Therefore, it is also very necessary to have a considerable number of college graduates serve as teaching assistants and graduate students in colleges and universities, as teachers in secondary schools, and as research interns in scientific research institutions. In order to concentrate the use of college graduates in key areas of construction, we must oppose the problems of decentralized deployment and focusing on one thing and losing sight of another. The State Council's instruction says: "General factories, mines, and administrative departments of organs will not be equipped, except in special circumstances." This is completely correct. On this issue, we must resolutely oppose egalitarianism and departmentalism, and consider everything from the overall interests of the country and the long-term interests of national construction.

A certain number of places have also been allocated to private enterprises in the national college graduate allocation plan. This is in line with the overall interests of national construction and the policy of considering both public and private interests. Personnel departments at all levels and graduating students should have a correct understanding of this. The view that "there is no future in working in private industrial and commercial enterprises" is wrong. Private economic undertakings are one of the economic components of our country. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates that private economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood should be "supported for their development." College graduates assigned to work in private enterprises should also actively and happily accept the assigned tasks and strive to do their work well.

In carrying out the specific work of allocating graduates, the principle of "combining learning with application" is a matter of universal concern to graduates, and it is also a principle that employing units and allocating agencies must pay attention to and master. If graduates can use what they have learned in their work posts, they can work with peace of mind and give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity. But to correctly grasp the principle of combining learning with application, we must first recognize the relationship between learning and application. The relationship between learning and application is the relationship between theory and practice. The knowledge and skills learned in school are not completely consistent with the requirements of actual work. In particular, the influence of the blindness of education in old China has caused the knowledge and skills of current college graduates to be quite distant from the actual needs of our new democratic country. Therefore, it is currently impossible to fully achieve the combination of learning and application in the allocation of work. It is inappropriate and unrealistic to emphasize the combination of learning and application in isolation and one-sidedly, divorced from the actual needs of national construction. The State Council's instruction says: "Implement the principle of combining learning with application on the basis of adapting to the needs of national construction." This puts the principle of combining learning with application on the basis of the needs of national construction, that is, enabling current college graduates to use what they have learned on the basis of obeying the needs of national construction. However, if the employing unit uses the needs of its own work as an excuse to ignore the principle of combining learning with application and does not allocate work according to the knowledge and skills learned by the graduates, it is a departmentalist practice of wasting talent and should be opposed. If the employing unit does not follow the principles of the State Council's instructions to allocate work, the graduate can apply to the unit itself and even to the Personnel Department of the Central People's Government, and can criticize the errors in the unit's allocation of work.

Of course, on the part of college graduates, they must also proceed from the actual needs of national construction in all aspects, to understand the principle of combining learning and application, to accept the work assigned by the People's Government, and should not passively accept work, and should not consider work issues from personal requirements. For example, unwillingness to leave big cities, unwillingness to work in remote areas, unwillingness to be people's teachers, etc. These are obviously not issues of the principle of combining learning and application, but a kind of fear of hardship, fear of difficulty, and consideration of work from the perspective of personal comfortable life. These ideas must be abandoned. It cannot be denied that the situation in remote areas is special and there are fewer talents. Going to work there is more difficult. But precisely because the situation in remote areas is special and there are fewer talents, it is even more necessary for people to go to work and it is easier for young people to give play to their creativity. Only when a large number of cadres actively go to remote areas and to the places where cadres are most needed, can our country have comprehensive development and progress. Young people should have the strong will and creative spirit of "turning deserts into fertile fields." The idea of only seeking personal comfortable life is the most unpromising and should not be had by patriotic youth. Similarly, those who are unwilling to do education work must also change their incorrect understanding. The education cause is an important part of national construction. Without education construction, economic construction cannot develop alone. All construction work requires people to do it, and the talents for construction must be cultivated through education. It is a fact that some teachers have not received the respect they deserve. This is a temporary phenomenon left over from the old society, and it is also because some teachers themselves still have shortcomings and have not been well reformed, so they have not yet gained the trust of the people. This makes it even more necessary for us to inject fresh blood into the education cause and transfer more revolutionary intellectuals to work as people's teachers. The idea of despising education work and unwillingness to be people's teachers is undoubtedly a wrong idea.

We believe that this year's college graduates will certainly be able to consciously obey the unified allocation of the People's Government with the attitude of masters; go wherever needed; go wherever it is difficult; take up their posts with a spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people and the motherland, with a fighting posture, humbly learn, work hard, and persistently overcome the difficulties that may be encountered in their work, so as to temper themselves to be stronger and more capable, in order to shoulder the glorious task of large-scale construction of our great motherland.

### 高等学校毕业生的光荣任务

    高等学校毕业生的光荣任务
    全国高等学校今年暑期毕业的学生，在人民政府统一分配之下，就要走上工作岗位，去参加国家的建设工作了。这对于即将到来的我国大规模建设事业，是具有重要意义的。
    两年来，我国高等学校的毕业生约有四万人已由人民政府有计划地分配到国家的各种建设岗位上去，成为新中国的建设者。他们在工作中得到了锻炼，在政治上、思想上和业务上，都有了很大的进步；其中有极少数的人被分配的工作不够恰当，不符合学用一致的原则，正由人民政府进行检查与调整；有些毕业生有特殊的困难，一般地也受到了必要的照顾；旧中国学生所饱尝的“毕业即失业”的痛苦，永远被消除了。这就使所有高等学校的毕业生都能积极愉快地为新生的祖国服务，为人民服务。
    全国高等学校今年暑期毕业生的人数，虽然比历届为多，但就我们国家即将开始的建设工作的规模来说，还是远远赶不上需要的。中央人民政府政务院确定以集中使用、重点配备为今年暑期高等学校毕业生统一分配工作的基本方针，首先是尽量满足基本建设的需要，其次是加强教育建设与科学研究工作。这个方针是正确的，是完全符合于我们国家今天的情况的。经济建设是今后我们国家的首要工作，而经济建设中的基本建设工作，又是整个经济建设工作的中心环节；因此，把大量的理、工、财经各科的毕业生集中配备到工厂、矿山和交通、水利事业中去，是十分必要的。同时，从国家建设的长期需要着眼，我们还必须大量培养干部，必须加强有关国防与经济建设的科学研究工作，因此，以相当数量的高等学校毕业生去担任高等学校的助教和研究生，担任中等学校的师资，担任科学研究机关的研究实习员，也是非常必要的。为了把高等学校毕业生集中使用到建设的重点方面，我们必须反对分散配备、顾此失彼的毛病。政务院指示中说：“一般厂矿和机关行政部门，除特殊情形外，不予配备”。这是完全正确的。在这个问题上，我们要坚决反对平均主义的思想和本位主义的思想，处处都从国家的整体利益和国家建设事业的长远利益出发来考虑。
    在全国高等学校毕业生的分配方案中也划出了一定的名额分配到私营企业方面。这是符合国家建设的全面利益和公私兼顾的政策的。各级人事部门和毕业同学对此应有正确的认识。那种认为“到私营工商企业中去工作根本没有前途”的看法是错误的。私营经济事业是我们国家的经济组成部分之一，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领明确规定，凡有利于国计民生的私营经济事业，应“扶助其发展”；分配到私营企业中去工作的高等学校毕业同学，同样应该积极愉快地接受分配的任务，努力把工作作好。
    在进行具体分配毕业生的工作上，“学用一致”的原则，是毕业生所普遍关心的，也是用人机关与分配机关必须注意掌握的。毕业生在工作岗位上能够用其所学，就能安心工作，发挥他们的积极性和创造性。但要正确掌握学用一致的原则，首先必须认清学与用的关系。学与用的关系，就是理论与实践的关系。在学校所学的知识与技能，本来不是与实际工作的要求完全一致的，特别是旧中国教育的盲目性的影响，使目前高等学校毕业生的知识与技能，对于我们新民主主义国家的实际需要来说，还有相当的距离。因此，在分配工作上，要完全做到学用一致，目前还不可能。如果离开国家建设的实际需要，孤立地、片面地强调学用一致是不妥当的、不合实际的。政务院指示中说：“在适应国家建设需要的基础上贯彻学用一致的原则”；这是把学用一致的原则，放在国家建设需要的基础之上，也就是使目前高等学校的毕业生在服从国家建设需要的基础之上用其所学。但是，如果用人机关藉口本身工作的需要，忽视学用一致的原则，不根据毕业生所学的知识与技能来分配工作，那就是浪费人材的本位主义的作法，应该加以反对。如果用人机关不遵照政务院指示的原则分配工作，毕业生可以向本机关直至中央人民政府人事部提出申请，并且可以对本机关分配工作的错误提出批评。
    当然，在高等学校的毕业学生方面，也必须处处从国家建设的实际需要出发，来认识学与用一致的原则，来接受人民政府所分配的工作，而不应该消极地接受工作，不应该从个人的要求来考虑工作问题。例如不愿离开大城市，不愿到边远地区去工作，不愿做人民教师等等，这些显然都不是什么学与用的原则问题，而是一种怕吃苦、怕困难、从个人舒适生活出发来考虑工作的想法。这些想法是必须抛弃的。不能否认，边远地区情况特殊，人材较少，到那里去工作，是有较多的困难的。但是正因为边远地区的情况特殊和人材较少，就更需要人去工作，更便于青年人发挥其创造性。只有大批的干部踊跃地到边远地区去，到最需要干部的地方去，我们的国家才会有全面的发展和进步。青年人应该有“变沙漠为良田”的坚强意志和创造精神。那种只图个人舒适生活的思想，是最无出息的、为爱国青年所不应有的思想。同样，不愿做教育工作的人，也必须改变自己不正确的认识。教育事业是国家建设中一个重要部分，没有教育建设，经济建设也不可能单独发展。一切建设工作要人去做，而建设的人材，就必须经过教育来培养。现在有些教师还没有受到应有的尊敬是事实，这是旧社会遗留的暂时现象，也是因为有些教师本身还有缺点，没有得到很好的改造，因而还不能取得人民的信任。这就更加需要我们向教育事业注入新鲜血液，调遣更多的革命知识分子来担任人民教师的工作。那种轻视教育工作和不愿意作人民教师的思想，无疑地是一种错误的思想。
    我们相信今年高等学校的毕业生，一定都能够以主人翁的态度，自觉地服从人民政府的统一分配；那里需要，就到那里去；那里艰苦，就到那里去；以全心全意为人民为祖国服务的精神，以战斗的姿态走上工作岗位，虚心学习，努力工作，坚忍地克服工作中可能遇到的困难，把自己锻炼得更加坚强、更有本领，以便肩负起我们伟大祖国大规模建设的光荣任务。
