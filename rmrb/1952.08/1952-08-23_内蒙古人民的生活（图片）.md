　　After liberation, some of the people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have settled down. Therefore, they have the conditions to develop production and improve their lives. Under the leadership of the People's Government, they have eliminated diseases and started a happy life of "flourishing people and livestock." These are the new houses they built after settling down.
