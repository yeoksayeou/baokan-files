    Guo Moruo Sends Telegram Congratulating India on Holding "Asia Week"
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, sent a telegram on August 2nd to Romesh Chandra, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-India Peace Council and Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, congratulating the Indian Preparatory Committee for the Peace Conference on holding "Asia Week" throughout India. The telegram is as follows:

    Mr. Chandra of the Indian Preparatory Committee:
    I am very pleased to learn that you are scheduled to hold "Asia Week" in India from August 3rd to 10th, and designate August 10th as "Asia Day," to call on the people of India to launch a broad movement to defend peace, focusing on publicizing the great significance of convening the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Since the representatives of your participation in the Preparatory Meeting returned to your country, you have taken effective steps to broadly launch the preparatory work for the Peace Conference, mobilizing national, provincial, and local political parties, cultural, social, and other mass organizations in India to hold widespread discussions, and through activities such as "Asia Week" and "Asia Day," to deeply implant the declaration of the Preparatory Meeting for the Peace Conference into the hearts of the people. This is a great impetus to the preparatory work for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. This is admirable. We have widely announced these situations at home and abroad, winning the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people.

    Warmongers are frantically militarizing Japan, attempting to undermine the Korean negotiations, and stepping up preparations to expand the war. The demands of the people of Asian and Pacific countries to save peace are increasing day by day, and people's confidence in the struggle for peace is also increasing. As long as we can further widely mobilize the masses, unite them, enable the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be successful, and pave the way for the World People's Peace Congress in December, the cause of peace will advance and peace can be saved. On behalf of the entire Chinese people, I congratulate you on achieving great results in this movement and extend my brotherly and cordial greetings to you!

    Guo Moruo, August 2nd

    郭沫若致电祝贺印度举行“亚洲周”
    【本报讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若，于八月二日致电全印和平理事会秘书处秘书、亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会副秘书长罗米西·钱德拉，祝贺和平会议印度筹备委员会在全印度举行的“亚洲周”。电文如下：印度筹备委员会钱德拉先生：
    很高兴地知道你们定于八月三日至十日在印度举行“亚洲周”，并定八月十日为“亚洲日”，借以号召全印度人民展开广泛的保卫和平运动，着重宣传召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的重大意义。自从你们参加筹备会议的代表返国后，你们即着手采取了有效步骤，广泛地展开了和平会议的筹备工作，动员印度全国各省的、地方的政治党派、文化、社会等群众团体，普遍召开讨论会，并通过“亚洲周”、“亚洲日”等活动，使和平会议筹备会议的宣言深入人心，这对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备工作是很大的推动。这是值得钦佩的。我们已将这些情形广泛地向国内外宣布，赢得广大人民热烈的拥护。
    好战分子正在疯狂地使日本军国主义化，企图破坏朝鲜谈判，加紧准备扩大战争。亚洲及太平洋各国人民对拯救和平的要求正在日益增强着，人们对和平斗争的信心也随着日益提高，只要我们能进一步广泛地发动群众，把他们团结起来，使亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议能够获得成功，并为十二月的世界人民和平大会铺平道路，和平事业即会向前推进，和平即可拯救。我代表全中国人民谨祝贺你们在这一运动当中，获得伟大的成果，并向你们致兄弟般亲切的敬礼！
    郭沫若  八月二日
