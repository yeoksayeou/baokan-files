Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 26th: A massive peace festival celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party (July 15th) was held on the 24th at Edogawa Park in Tokyo. Approximately 80,000 people participated in the peace festival. The venue featured exhibitions about the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the heroic struggles of the Korean people for freedom and independence.

Several thousand people participated in various sports and competitions that began in the morning. In the afternoon, a mass meeting was held, chaired by the famous artist Chojuro Kawarasaki. Professor Ikuo Oyama, a recipient of the Stalin International Peace Prize, the renowned lawyer Tatsuji Fuse, Communist Party member of parliament Hachijiro Kazahaya, and former Communist Party member of the House of Councillors, Karo Hosokawa, delivered speeches.

Ikuo Oyama, the chairman of the committee hosting the peace festival, emphasized the great victory of the festival. He said that this victory demonstrates that the masses support the Japanese Communist Party. Oyama said: For the past thirty years, the Japanese proletariat, hand in hand with the proletariat of other countries, has been struggling to build a peaceful society without capitalists and landlords, without economic crises and wars. Today, the Japanese people are closely united with hundreds of millions of people in other countries around the world, waging a persistent struggle for peace.

The conference passed many resolutions: demanding an immediate end to the Korean War, demanding the dissolution of the Japanese "Police Reserve Force," and opposing Japanese rearmament and the re-implementation of conscription. The conference also passed a resolution on participating in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.
