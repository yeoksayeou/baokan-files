The East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened the Joint Conference of Employee Representatives from State-Owned Trade, Finance, Transportation, Taxation, and Cooperative Departments in East China, which opened in Shanghai on the 25th of this month. The task of this conference is to mobilize and organize 400,000 employees from the five major financial and economic departments in the entire region to launch a comprehensive and sustained patriotic labor emulation campaign to further develop the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. More than 2,200 representatives attended the conference, including leaders from the East China Region, provinces (regions), municipal People's Governments' industrial and commercial administrative departments, the five major financial and economic departments, and trade unions, as well as employee representatives from the five departments in 48 major cities and some important market towns throughout the region.

On the first day of the Joint Conference of Employee Representatives from the Five Major Financial and Economic Departments in East China, Comrade Tan Zhenlin of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China delivered a report to the conference. In his report, he explained that all the necessary conditions for national economic construction had been met, pointed out the importance of commerce in the construction of a new democratic economy, and emphasized the need for a high tide of material exchange between urban and rural areas to create better conditions for the development of industrial and agricultural production. Tan Zhenlin put forward four main links that must be grasped in further developing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas: First, it is necessary to oppose the ideas of each doing things in its own way and departmentalism, so that the five major financial and economic departments must serve the development of the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, unify ideological understanding, cooperate with each other, and act together; and improve future working relationships through contact contracts. Second, it is necessary to implement policies, unite and lead the private economy, and increase their enthusiasm for operation. Third, it is necessary to rely on the masses and mobilize the masses, first of all to mobilize the 400,000 employees of the five major departments to consciously launch a patriotic labor emulation; and also to bring along the employees of private enterprises. Through the emulation campaign, the exchange of goods will be developed more quickly and healthily. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the CCP committees and the financial and economic committees of the People's Governments, and strengthen the planning and organization of financial and economic affairs. In his report, Tan Zhenlin instructed the trade union work of the five major departments: It is necessary to strengthen the trade union work of the five major departments, and gradually improve the working conditions and health and welfare measures of the employees. The phenomenon of the leadership of the five departments neglecting trade union work and ignoring the welfare of employees must be improved.

Zeng Shan, Vice Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, delivered a summary report to the conference on the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in East China this year. He also gave important instructions on the work of the autumn exchange of goods conference. Liu Changsheng, Director of the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a report on strengthening trade union work and launching a patriotic labor emulation.

The conference will last for seven days. On the second day of the conference, the heads of the five major departments at the East China regional level will make reports on the tasks of their respective departments in the second half of the year. After listening to the above reports, all the representatives will organize discussions in the form of the five departments and the provinces (regions) and cities, and specifically study the emulation targets and the contact contracts between the departments.

Before the opening of the Joint Conference of Employee Representatives from the Five Major Financial and Economic Departments in East China, the Financial and Economic Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee convened a joint conference of the heads of industrial and commercial administration, trade unions, and the five departments at the East China Administrative Region level and the provincial (regional) and municipal levels from August 20 to 24. The conference summarized the work of exchanging goods between urban and rural areas this summer, determined the specific tasks of various departments in the second half of the year under the general task of further developing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and put forward the indicators and policy requirements for launching labor emulation, which prepared the way for the Joint Conference of Employee Representatives of the Five Major Departments. At this meeting, Tan Zhenlin, on behalf of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report on financial and economic policies to the heads of various departments attending the meeting. The heads of the five major departments and trade unions at the East China regional level made reports on the work of their respective departments and the tasks for the second half of the year. In their reports, they made self-criticisms on the problems in the working relationship in the past and put forward suggestions for improving the working relationship. When making self-criticisms, the heads of various departments revealed the shortcomings that they were not coordinated enough in their work in the past due to the fact that they only proceeded from the perspective of their own business and the tasks of their own units, and they also learned about the actual difficulties in each other's work. The conference organized discussions on the reports of Comrade Tan Zhenlin and various departments in the form of five departments and provinces (regions) and cities. Under the common task of comprehensively promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and developing industrial and agricultural production, the responsible personnel of various departments reached a consensus and respectively drafted draft indicators for labor emulation and contact contracts between them.

  　动员和组织职工进一步开展爱国竞赛运动
    中华全国总工会华东办事处召开的华东区国营贸易、金融、交通、税务、合作社职工代表联席会议，于本月二十五日在上海市开幕。这次会议的任务，是动员和组织全区五大财政经济部门四十万职工，为进一步发展城乡物资交流而展开全面、持久的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动。出席这次会议的代表有二千二百多人，包括华东区、各省（区）、市人民政府工商行政部门、五大财政经济部门、工会的负责人及全区四十八个主要城市和一部分重要集镇的五个部门的职工代表。
    华东区五大财政经济部门职工代表联席会议开幕的第一天，中共中央华东局谭震林同志向大会作了报告。他在报告中说明了国家经济建设的各项必要条件业已具备，指出商业在新民主主义经济建设中的重要性，必须要有一个城乡物资交流的高潮，为发展工农业生产创造更好的条件。谭震林提出了在进一步开展城乡物资交流工作中必须抓住的四个主要环节，就是：一、必须反对各自为政、本位主义的思想，使五大财政经济部门都要为发展城乡物资交流服务，统一思想认识，协同一致、共同行动；用联系合同的方式，改进今后的工作关系。二、必须贯彻政策，团结与领导私营经济，提高他们经营的积极性。三、必须依靠群众、发动群众，首先把五大部门四十万职工发动起来，自觉地展开爱国主义劳动竞赛；而且也要把私营企业的职工带动起来。通过竞赛运动，使物资交流更迅速、健康地展开。四、必须加强中共党委和人民政府财政经济委员会的领导，加强财政经济的计划组织工作。谭震林在报告中对于五大部门的工会工作指示说：必须加强五大部门的工会工作，逐步改善职工的劳动条件和卫生福利措施。五个部门领导方面存在着的轻视工会工作、忽视职工福利的现象必须改进。
    华东军政委员会曾山副主席向大会作了华东区今年城乡物资交流工作的总结报告。并对秋季物资交流会议的工作作了重要指示。中华全国总工会华东办事处刘长胜主任作了关于加强工会工作开展爱国主义劳动竞赛的报告。
    这次会议将举行七天，会议第二天，华东区一级五大部门的负责人分别作关于本部门下半年工作任务的报告。全体代表听取了以上各项报告后，将分别以五个部门及各省（区）、市为单位，组织讨论，并具体地研究竞赛指标及各部门间的联系合同。
    华东区五大财政经济部门职工代表联席会议开幕前，华东军政委员会财政经济委员会曾在八月二十日到二十四日召集华东大行政区一级及各省（区）、市一级工商行政、工会及五个部门的负责人举行联席会议。会议总结了今年夏季的城乡物资交流工作，在进一步发展城乡物资交流的总任务下，确定了各部门今年下半年的具体任务，提出了开展劳动竞赛的指标和政策要求，为五大部门职工代表联席会议作好了准备。在这个会议上，谭震林代表中共中央华东局对到会的各部门负责人作了关于财政经济政策的报告，华东区一级五大部门及工会负责人分别提出了关于本部门工作情况和下半年工作任务的报告。他们在报告中关于过去在工作关系方面的问题作了自我批评，提出了改进工作关系的意见。各部门负责人在进行自我批评时，揭发了过去由于单从本身业务角度和本单位任务观点出发，以致彼此在工作上不够协调一致的缺点，也相互了解到彼此工作中的实际困难。会议分别以五个部门及各省（区）、市为单位，对谭震林同志和各部门的报告进行讨论。在全面促进城乡物资交流、发展工农业生产的共同任务下，各部门负责人员取得了一致的认识，并分别拟订了劳动竞赛的指标及彼此间的联系合同草案。　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
