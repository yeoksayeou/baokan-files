    The North China Administrative Committee Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Committee
    Issues Emergency Instructions on Strengthening Safety and Health Work in Factories and Mines
    Since the launch of the production increase and thrift campaign in the North China region on July 1, factories and mines in various places have achieved great results. However, work-related accidents and employee sick leave rates have continued to increase, seriously hindering the progress of the production increase and thrift campaign. In order to effectively correct the erroneous phenomenon of neglecting safety in production in factories and mines in various places, the North China Administrative Committee Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Committee recently issued emergency instructions on strengthening safety and health work in factories and mines.
    The instructions first pointed out that recently, the high number of work-related accidents and the high employee sick leave rate in state-owned factories and mines have become a serious obstacle to the in-depth patriotic production increase and thrift campaign. Leaders in various places have begun to pay attention to this issue, and some provinces and cities have issued instructions and decisions; this is correct and timely. However, the number of accidents and sick workers in some factories and mines is still increasing. If this continues to develop, it will lead to the bad result of the leadership being divorced from the masses. Due to the large number of accidents, some factories and mines have been forced to stop work or have been unable to complete their production plans.
    The instructions pointed out the causes of the accidents, saying: According to a survey of more than 1,700 accidents in Tianjin, more than 92 percent were caused by leadership negligence and complacency, failure to adequately improve or add safety protection equipment where possible, and lack of security systems or safe operating procedures. These accidents can be completely avoided as long as the enterprise leaders pay serious attention to prevention; only less than 8 percent of the accidents are caused by workers violating labor discipline and operating procedures, or due to current economic and technical conditions failing to improve certain safety equipment. However, as long as the leadership pays serious attention in advance, such accidents can also be greatly reduced. Therefore, there is no reason to emphasize special circumstances, difficult conditions, heavy tasks, or workers not following the rules. The repeated occurrence of accidents, especially in places where accidents are repeated, is mainly due to the fact that the leading cadres of these units have adopted an intolerable bureaucratic attitude towards production and the working people. These cadres do not understand that people are one of the main factors in production. They hold a simple task-oriented view, put safety in opposition to production, do not consider workers' suggestions on safety and health, and do not implement labor protection laws. Some have already attracted attention, but have not truly solved the problem ideologically, and there is no definite change.
    In order to effectively correct the above-mentioned erroneous phenomena and further ensure the safe conduct of the production increase and thrift campaign, the instructions require all units that lead and manage factories and mines to earnestly implement the following measures:
    (1) Factories and mines in various regions should immediately convene labor protection work meetings attended by relevant departments and worker representatives to thoroughly check labor protection, safety and health work from top to bottom. Regions and factories and mines where security inspections were not thorough before the competition must conduct inspections without exception; those that have been inspected must also conduct re-inspections. Thoroughly criticize and correct various erroneous ideas of leaders who do not attach importance to safety in production, thoroughly deal with all incidents that have occurred, severely punish those responsible for dereliction of duty that resulted in accidents, and earnestly reward factories, workshops, groups, and individuals (including factory directors) who have made achievements in safety and health work. Vigorously publicize their achievements and promote their experience. Mobilize the masses to establish and improve security organizations and systems. The content related to safety and health in the production competition plans of each factory, workshop, group, and individual should be checked if they already exist, and supplemented if they are missing. The principle of safety in production should be earnestly implemented ideologically, organizationally, in regulations and systems, in production plans, in technological improvements, and in daily work. In the future, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League should specifically discuss safety and health issues once a month, and strictly implement the reporting system for work-related accidents.
    (2) Each factory and mine should immediately strengthen or establish a competent safety production management organization, assign capable full-time personnel to be responsible for safety and health work, and smaller factories and mines should also designate special personnel to manage this work, and earnestly implement the safety responsibility system.
    (3) Necessary and possible safety equipment and protective equipment should be fully resolved immediately. Thoroughly inspect production equipment and repair houses. Problems that belong to capital construction and cannot be completely resolved should be resolved with temporary measures, and specific plans should be formulated to complete them within a time limit. Safety and health funds that should be spent must not be held up, and factory director funds should be used for worker welfare in a timely manner. If the funds required for handling cannot be completely resolved by the factory and mine, a budget should be prepared and submitted to the superior leadership organ, and each superior leadership organ should promptly resolve it in accordance with regulations and the budget.
    (4) Improve environmental sanitation and ensure that workers eat well, drink well, and sleep well. High-temperature workshops should prepare sufficient mung bean soup or salt water and other beverages. Strengthen the leadership of food service units and increase necessary equipment. Eliminate bed bugs, mosquitoes, and flies in worker dormitories. Health administrative departments must make doing a good job in factory and mine hygiene one of their priorities. The environmental hygiene of general factories and enterprises must not be inferior to the hygiene of urban streets.
    (5) Streamline meetings to ensure that workers have sufficient rest time. Each unit should formulate meeting plans in a phased and unified manner, exercise unified control, and strictly implement them. Work with the same content should be unified in one type of meeting, and executed separately after a decision is made. All meetings must be fully prepared in advance to eliminate meeting repetition and time delays. Workers' spare time (including various meetings, studies, recreational activities, etc.) should not exceed twelve hours per week. Anyone who works the night shift is not allowed to attend meetings.
    (6) Thoroughly handle and explain the safety and health suggestions made by workers, attach importance to workers' creations in this regard, and assign special personnel or competent departments to review and handle them quickly. Important ones should be rewarded.
    (7) The labor protection, safety, and health work in private factories and mines should be inspected by the government labor department in conjunction with the labor union in accordance with labor protection laws, and improved in accordance with the law. Those who violate the law will be dealt with in accordance with the law.

    华北行政委员会爱国增产节约竞赛运动委员会
    发出加强厂矿安全卫生工作的紧急指示
    华北全区自七月一日开展增产节约竞赛运动以来，各地厂矿企业获得了巨大的成绩，但是工伤事故和职工病假率均不断增加，致使增产节约竞赛运动的开展受到严重障碍。华北行政委员会爱国增产节约竞赛运动委员会为切实纠正各地厂矿忽视安全生产的错误现象，特于日前发出加强厂矿安全卫生工作的紧急指示。
    指示首先指出：最近，各国公营厂矿企业中，工伤事故之多和职工病假率之高，已成为深入爱国增产节约竞赛运动的严重障碍。各地领导上已开始重视这一问题，有些省市并已作出指示与决定；这是正确的和切合时宜的。但目前有些厂矿的事故和病员仍有增无减，继续发展下去，就会造成领导脱离群众的恶果。由于事故的大量发生，有的厂矿已有被迫停工或因此不能完成生产计划的现象。
    指示指出发生事故的原因说：据天津市一千七百余件事故调查，由于领导上疏忽麻痹、没有在可能条件下适当改善或增添安全防护设备，缺乏保安制度或安全操作规程等原因所造成的占百分之九十二以上。这些事故，只要企业负责人员认真注意防范，是完全可以避免的；只有不足百分之八的事故，是由于工人违犯劳动纪律和操作规程、或由于目前经济条件和技术条件所限未能改善某些安全设备所造成，但只要领导上事先认真注意，这类事故也是可以大大减少的。因此，没有理由强调情况特殊、条件困难、任务繁忙、工人不守规矩。事故迭生，特别是一再重复事故的地方，主要是由于这些单位的领导干部，对于生产、对于劳动人民采取了不能容忍的官僚主义态度，这些干部不了解人是生产中的主要因素之一，他们抱着单纯的任务观点，把安全与生产对立起来，不考虑工人的安全卫生的建议，不执行劳动保护法令，有的虽已引起了注意，但并未从思想上真正解决问题，尚无确切的转变。
    为了切实纠正上述错误现象，进一步保证增产节约竞赛运动的安全进行，指示要求所有领导和管理厂矿企业的单位，认真执行以下措施：
    （一）各地区厂矿企业立即召开有关部门和职工代表参加的劳动保护工作会议，自上而下地深入地检查劳动保护、安全卫生工作。竞赛前保安检查不彻底的地区和厂矿，毫无例外的均须进行检查；已检查过的也要进行复查。彻底批判和纠正领导干部中不重视安全生产的各种错误思想，彻底处理所有已发生的事件，严肃地惩罚那些失职的招致事故的负责人，认真奖励在安全卫生工作上有成绩的厂矿、车间、小组和个人（包括厂长在内），大力宣传他们的成绩和推广其经验。发动群众建立和健全保安组织和制度。各厂矿、车间、小组、个人的生产竞赛计划中有关安全卫生的内容，已有者检查之，尚缺者补订之，从思想上、组织上、规程制度上、生产计划上、技术改进上和日常工作中切实贯彻安全生产的方针。以后党、政、工、团要每月专门讨论一次安全卫生问题，并严格执行工伤事故的报告制度。
    （二）各厂矿应即加强或设立安全生产的主管机构，指派有能力的专职人员负责安全卫生工作，较小厂矿也应指定专人管理此项工作，切实贯彻安全责任制。
    （三）必需而又可能解决的安全设备和防护用具，应立即全部解决。彻底检查生产设备和检修房屋。属于基本建设而不可能全部解决的问题，应用临时办法解决，并制定具体计划，限期完成。应开支的安全卫生经费不得积压，厂长基金应及时用于职工福利事业。处理中所需经费，如本厂矿不能完全解决者，应即做出预算报请上级领导机关，各上级领导机关应按规定和预算迅予解决。
    （四）改善环境卫生，保证工人吃好、喝好、睡好。高温车间应准备充足的绿豆汤或盐水等饮料。加强对伙食单位的领导，增加必要的设备。扑灭工人宿舍中的臭虫、蚊子、苍蝇等。卫生行政部门必须把搞好厂矿卫生工作作为重点之一，一般工厂企业的环境卫生工作不得劣于城市街道的卫生工作。
    （五）精简会议，保证工人有充分的休息时间。各单位逐期统一拟订会议计划，统一掌握，严格执行。同一内容的工作应统一于一种会议，决定后分头执行，各种会议必须事先充分准备，杜绝会议重复和拖延时间的现象。工人业余活动时间（包括各种会议、学习、文娱活动等），每周不得超过十二小时。凡下夜班者，一律不准开会。
    （六）彻底地分别处理和交代工人提出的有关安全卫生之建议，重视工人有关这方面的创造，责成专人或主管部门迅予审处，重要者应予奖励。
    （七）私营厂矿企业中的劳动保护、安全卫生工作，由政府劳动部门结合工会按劳动保护法令实行检查，并依法改进，违抗法令者依法议处。
