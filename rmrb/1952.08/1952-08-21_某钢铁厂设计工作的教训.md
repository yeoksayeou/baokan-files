    Lessons from the Design Work of a Certain Steel Plant
    Wang Chang, Design Engineer of a Certain Steel Plant

    In the winter of 1950, under the leadership of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, we began the design work of a certain steel plant, which has been going on for a year and a half. Although we have been working very hard and have produced a set of "preliminary designs," because we did not conduct detailed surveys and explorations of mineral resources, coal resources, factory geology, power, water sources, wharves, transportation, and the surrounding environment, the "preliminary designs" we made are very unrealistic. Now, we have to start all over again.

    The first thing to consider when building a steel plant is the source of ore and coal. We did not conduct good surveys and explorations, but only designed based on some old, fragmented and incorrect data. For example, regarding the source of coking coal, we did not consult with the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, but decided that it would be supplied by two nearby coal mines. Later, we learned that the coal from these two coal mines could not only not supply enough in terms of output, but also was not suitable for coking in terms of coal composition. Therefore, we had to consider new sources of coal. We also did not clarify the reserves of iron ore. Although we entrusted the exploration work to the geological department, they did not produce reliable data. Therefore, we have not been able to determine the size of the plant.

    We also did not conduct thorough investigations when selecting the factory site. First, before the scale of the factory was determined, we designed the layout plan based on the American design spirit. After the Soviet experts studied it, they felt that the factory site was too small. According to the currently determined scale of the factory, it is almost half the size needed. Second, we did not consider that after the steel plant is built, other related industries will inevitably develop along with it. Considering the factory site only from the perspective of a steel plant is not suitable for the future development of industry. Third, we did not conduct geological drilling before designing the foundation engineering, which resulted in placing the blast furnace on an unsuitable foundation. Because of these three shortcomings, we now have to re-select the factory site.

    Regarding the determination of the water source, we also did not conduct investigations and research during the design, but blindly decided to use river water. Last year, after the water supply engineers studied the site, they believed that the river water was turbid and unsuitable. Moreover, the river water rises and falls irregularly, making it difficult to supply water. If a pumping station is set up, it will be even more difficult; if power is used to supply water, the cost will be too high. They suggested using the water from nearby lakes. Because the water in these lakes is clear, and the water level difference is enough for flow, it can be utilized. Therefore, the design was changed again, and a new survey was conducted.

    From the lessons of this design work, and after preliminary study of the Soviet design experience, we have deeply realized that industrial design work is not a purely technical work, but a combination of technology and economy, and an organizational work that integrates the professional knowledge of various fields. To do a good job in design, it is necessary to have detailed resource and geological survey materials, to consider economic rationality and the possibility of production technology, and to consider the development prospects of the entire national economy. The reason why we did not do a good job in survey and exploration in the past was, on the one hand, because we didn't understand it, and on the other hand, and more importantly, because we blindly copied the American design experience.

    某钢铁厂设计工作的教训
    某钢铁厂设计工程师　王厂
    一九五○年冬天，我们在中央重工业部钢铁工业局的领导下，开始进行某钢铁厂的设计工作，到现在已经有一年半的时间了。虽然我们都很紧张地进行工作，并且也搞出了一套“初步设计”，但是，因为我们对于矿源、煤源、工厂地质、动力、水源、码头、运输和周围环境等，都没有进行详细的调查和勘察，所以，做出来的“初步设计”，是很不切合实际的。现在，不得不从头做起。
    建设钢铁厂首先考虑的是矿源和煤源。我们都没有很好地调查和勘测，只根据一些旧的残碎而不正确的资料来设计。譬如炼焦煤的来源，我们没有和中央燃料工业部研究，就决定由附近的两个煤矿供给。其后才知道这两个煤矿的煤，不但在产量方面不能供给，而且在煤的成份方面，也不适于炼焦。因此，不得不考虑新的煤源。铁矿的蕴藏量，我们也没有弄清楚。我们虽然把勘测工作委托给地质部门，但他们没有搞出确实的资料来。因此，关于这个厂的规模究竟多大，我们一直不能确定。
    在选择厂址时，我们也没有进行周密的调查。第一、工厂的规模没有确定，我们就根据美国设计的精神，设计平面布置图。苏联专家研究以后，觉得厂址面积太小了。根据现在决定的工厂规模来看，几乎小了二分之一。第二、我们没有考虑到：钢铁厂建设起来以后，其他有关的工业必将跟着发展起来。仅从一个钢铁厂来考虑厂址问题是不适合于将来工业发展的需要的。第三、我们没有进行地质钻探，就进行基础工程的设计，以致把高炉的位置摆在不妥当的地基上。因为有这三个缺点，现在不得不重新选择厂址。
    关于水源的决定，我们设计时，也没有进行调查和研究，就盲目地决定用江水。去年，供水工程师们到现场研究后，认为江水混浊，不适用。并且江水涨落无常，不易供水。如果设水泵站，就更困难；如果用动力供水，则成本太高。他们建议用附近湖泊的水。因为这些湖泊的水清，而且其水位差正够流动，可以利用。因此，又改变了设计，重新勘测调查。
    从这一段设计工作的教训中，以及初步学习苏联的设计经验以后，我们深刻地体会到工业的设计工作，不是单纯的技术工作，而是技术和经济的结合，以及综合了各行专业知识的组织工作。要做好设计工作，必需有详细的资源和地质的勘察材料，需要考虑到经济上合理性和生产技术上的可能性，并且考虑到整个国民经济的发展前途。我们过去所以没有做好调查和勘察工作，一方面，是不懂，另一方面，也是主要的方面，是我们盲目地搬弄美国设计的经验的缘故。
