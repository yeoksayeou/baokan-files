Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, August 8th: Under the strikes of our increasingly strong anti-aircraft artillery units, the enemy air force's vaunted "concentrated raids" have once again suffered a shameful defeat.

	There is an important bridge on the transportation line leading to the central front. Not long ago, the U.S. invading air force in Korea dispatched large numbers of aircraft to carry out concentrated bombing there twice in four days. The first attack involved forty-five enemy aircraft. In the forty-five-minute battle fought by our anti-aircraft artillery units, four were shot down and nine were damaged. The second attack involved sixty-seven enemy aircraft. After thirty-three minutes of fierce fighting between our anti-aircraft artillery units and the enemy aircraft, six enemy aircraft were shot down and ten were damaged.

	The most intense battle was the second one. At 11:45 AM one day, the air observer issued an enemy air raid alert. Then, a low rumble of engines faintly came from the south. Commander Zhao Tianzhong saw sixty-seven enemy aircraft through his binoculars, flying in a combat formation from over 5,000 meters away. He immediately issued orders to all positions: "Prepare for battle! Pay attention to the direction of the dive, block the dive angle, and don't give the American aerial bandits a chance to aim!" At this time, eight F-84 fighter planes had already flown over the position and were circling, while another eighteen enemy planes only circled halfway above before lining up and diving. Our artillery immediately opened fire, and the shells exploded in the sky into countless smoke rings, surrounding the enemy planes. The second enemy plane was hit and caught fire. The first one had just dived down and was climbing back up when its left wing was also hit. It dragged a black tail and, protected by two enemy planes, fled eastward. Seeing that the situation was not good, the other diving enemy planes also scrambled to high altitude in a panic.

	Unable to break through with their attack, the enemy planes changed their tactics. More than sixty planes circled in the sky, and more than twenty of them suddenly dived in three lines simultaneously. Our anti-aircraft gunners had made preparations long ago, and fired from all directions according to the predetermined firing range. The shells fired wove a dense net of fire in the sky, foiling the enemy's attempt to disperse and confuse our firepower.

	Failing twice to attack, the enemy planes concentrated all their firepower on our No. 3 position for the third time, attempting to open a gap here to attack the bridge. The No. 3 position was instantly engulfed in flames. But the gunners on the position continued to fight bravely. Each gun wove a crossfire on the flanks to fire at the enemy planes, defeating the enemy's third fierce attack.

	Suffering a disastrous defeat, the enemy planes hastily fled the range of our artillery fire and vented their anger on an empty hilltop, pouring their bombs and machine gun bullets onto that empty hilltop.

	At 12:18 PM, this tense and fierce air battle ended victoriously.

    美国空军的“重点突袭”又一次遭到惨败
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】在我军日益壮大的高射炮部队的打击下，敌人空军所吹嘘的“重点突袭”又一次遭到了可耻的失败。
    在通往中部前线的运输线上有一座重要的桥梁。不久以前，美国侵朝空军曾在四天内连续两次出动大批飞机向那里进行过集中轰炸。第一次来袭敌机四十五架，在我高射炮部队四十五分钟的作战中，被击落四架，击伤九架。第二次来袭敌机六十七架，经我高射炮部队与敌机三十三分钟的激烈战斗，击落敌机六架，击伤十架。
    最激烈的战斗还是第二次。某日上午十一时四十五分，对空观察员发出了敌机空袭的警报。接着，从南方隐隐地传来了低沉的马达声。指挥员赵田忠从望远镜里看到有六十七架敌机，从五千公尺以外摆好战斗队形飞来了。他立即向各阵地发出命令：“准备战斗！注意俯冲方向，堵住俯冲角，不要给美国空中强盗瞄准的机会！”这时，已有八架F—八十四战斗机飞临阵地上空盘旋，另有十八架敌机只在上空绕了半个圈子就排成一线俯冲下来了。我们的炮立即开火，炮弹在天空爆炸成无数烟圈，把敌机包围了起来。第二架敌机被击中起火，第一架刚俯冲下来，往上起飞时，也被击中左翅，拖着黑尾巴，由两架敌机保护着向东逃去了。其它俯冲下来的敌机见势不妙，也都仓皇地钻向高空。
    敌机冲击不成，改变了战术。六十多架飞机在天空绕成一个大圈子，其中二十多架突然分三路齐头俯冲。我高射炮手们早作好了准备，按预定射界从四面八方发射，射出的炮弹在天空中织成了严密的火网，敌机企图分散和混乱我火力的诡计失败了。
    敌机两次攻击不成，第三次就把所有的火力都集中到我第三号阵地，企图从这里打开一道冲击桥梁的缺口。第三号阵地顿成火海。但阵地上的炮手们却继续英勇地战斗着。各炮在侧翼织成交叉火力向敌机射击，打垮了敌机的第三次猛攻。
    敌机遭到了惨败，急忙逃出我们炮火的威力圈，向着一个空山头出气，把他们的炸弹、机枪子弹都倾泻到那空山头上。
    十二时十八分，这场紧张激烈的对空作战胜利结束。
