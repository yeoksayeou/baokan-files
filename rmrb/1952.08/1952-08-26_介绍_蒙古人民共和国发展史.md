Introducing "A History of the Development of the Mongolian People's Republic"

　　"A History of the Development of the Mongolian People's Republic" by Soviet author Zlatkin, translated by Chen Dawei, published by the Era Publishing House in June 1952.

　　"A History of the Development of the Mongolian People's Republic," published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1950, is the first comprehensive work in the Soviet Union to discuss the modern history of Mongolia. "The special value of this book lies in the fact that it elucidates the modern and contemporary history of Mongolia in a very detailed and comprehensive manner for the first time in our country's literature." This is the fitting comment made by Tsapkin and Yulev in their review of "A History of the Development of the Mongolian People's Republic" in the June 1951 issue of the Soviet journal "Problems of History."

　　Zlatkin begins writing this book by analyzing the socio-economic structure and class relations of Mongolia before the revolution. The author points out that Mongolia's economy before the revolution was still stagnant at the stage of a natural economy, and handicrafts were only in their embryonic stage. At that time, due to the invasion of Chinese and Russian commercial usurious capital, small handicraft workshops and home handicrafts of Chinese and Russian merchants began to appear in Mongolia. However, because Chinese and Russian merchants did not leave the profits they extracted in Mongolia to develop Mongolia's economy but transported them abroad, the small handicraft workshops and home handicrafts of Chinese and Russian merchants did not promote the development of Mongolia's economy. In pre-revolutionary Mongolia, feudal lords relied on the ownership of pastures to stipulate various economic or extra-economic exploitation systems, so that the pastoral serfs were forever bound to the land of the feudal lords. The feudal lords' "system of labor exploitation of the Arats [Note 1] was the economic foundation of feudal Mongolia before the revolution."

　　Before the revolution, the Mongolian people, unable to bear the oppression of the Manchu dynasty and Chinese commercial usurious capital, launched a national liberation movement. In 1912, simultaneously with the victory of the Chinese Xinhai Revolution against the Manchu dynasty, the Mongolian people got rid of the shackles of the Manchu dynasty and gained Mongolian autonomous power. However, because the feudal lords usurped the fruits of the people's victory, the living conditions and socio-economic foundation of the Mongolian people were not changed.

　　Before the revolution, the class contradictions in Mongolia had reached an acute level, and the feudal lords' oppression of the people made it impossible for the people to continue living as before. Therefore, the situation for a direct revolution in the country had matured. But the author also points out that the victory of the Russian socialist revolution created the objective possibility for the Mongolian people to achieve revolutionary victory. The Mongolian people learned from the experience of the Russian revolution and organized the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party—the People's Party [Note 2]; and under the leadership of the People's Party, they held an armed uprising. Finally, with the direct help of the Soviet Red Army, the Mongolian people achieved revolutionary victory.

　　The founding of the Mongolian People's Republic was a great change in Mongolian history, dividing Mongolia into two distinct eras. The author discusses it in several stages according to the historical period of the development of the Mongolian Republic. The first stage was from 1921 to 1924. During this period, suppressing the resistance of counter-revolutionary elements became an important task of the Party and the government. The second stage was from 1924 to 1932. During this period, because the Mongolian People's Republic abolished the privileges of the feudal class and eliminated foreign commercial usurious capital, the livestock economy of Mongolia's free herdsmen was greatly developed, and some wealthy herdsmen developed a hired labor livestock economy, thus Mongolia began to produce capitalism. When analyzing the socio-economic situation of Mongolia during this period, the author focuses on the struggle of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party to overcome the erroneous policies of the right-leaning restorationists and "left-leaning" elements within the Party. Right-leaning elements underestimated the resistance of feudal forces and the harm of the growth of capitalist elements, while "left-leaning" adventurists denied that Mongolia had to go through a long-term transformation and attempted to immediately eliminate capitalism and directly enter the stage of socialist construction.

　　Chapter 4 of this book discusses the third stage of the Mongolian People's Republic, from 1932 to 1940. During this period, Mongolia, under the guidance of the Party's correct political line, achieved brilliant achievements. The feudal class was eliminated, the state completely controlled the economic lifeline, and industrial construction was carried out. In 1938, the industrial production of the Mongolian People's Republic had supplied 25 percent of the total commodity needs of the domestic market. At this time, the economic components of the country had undergone fundamental changes, and the natural economy was no longer the dominant economic component in the national economy, but the small commodity economy. The state-owned and cooperative economic components, which occupied an absolutely overwhelming advantage in industry, mechanized transportation, and commerce, grew stronger and became a powerful factor. The private capitalist economy had been considerably developed, but it was under the supervision of the state-owned economy. By 1940, the Mongolian People's Republic had laid the foundation for a new economic system, and the country had steadily embarked on the path of non-capitalist development.

　　In the last chapter, the author narrates the great achievements made in various aspects since the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic and clarifies that Mongolia is crossing the stage of capitalism and moving towards the road of socialism from 1940. Mongolia was a backward nomadic people before the revolution, but now it has become an advanced people's democratic country. Before the revolution, Mongolia had no industry or agriculture of its own. Almost all Mongolians were illiterate, and there was only one aristocratic school in the country. At that time, there were neither doctors nor veterinarians, nor had any roads been built. Even dirt roads did not exist. Transportation relied only on cattle, horses, and camels. The current face of Mongolia has completely changed. Large-scale factories such as machinery, electricity, and wool have been opened throughout the country, and underground riches are also being developed, and high-quality coal has been produced. Under the guidance of the Soviet Union's advanced experience, the Gobi Desert has been opened up, and machine rental networks and veterinary networks have been established throughout the country and in the Gobi Desert. With the opening of roads, modern automobile transportation has been established, and telegraphs and telephones have been set up in various places. Of particular significance is the railway that has been laid from Ulaanbaatar to the Soviet Union. There are now 428 schools across the country, illiteracy will be completely eliminated, eight central newspapers and 19 local newspapers have been published, and many works of Marxism-Leninism have been published in Mongolian. Mongolia's leap from a backward nomadic people to an advanced people's democratic country is something that has never happened in world history. Why did Mongolia have such a leap? The author points out that the Soviet people's help to the Mongolian people "plays a decisive role."

　　After comprehensively discussing the history of the Mongolian People's Republic in various periods, this book summarizes the experience of the struggle of the Mongolian People's Republic. The author points out that in the new historical conditions, backward countries, with the help of the Soviet Union, can skip the stage of capitalism and develop towards socialism. The experience of the Mongolian People's Republic fully proves Lenin's thesis. When Lenin spoke at the Second Congress of the Communist International in July 1920, he said: "If the victorious proletariat of the revolution carries out systematic propaganda for those nations, and the Soviet government does its best to help them, then it is incorrect to think that the stage of capitalist development is inevitable for backward nations. ...Backward countries, with the help of the proletariat of advanced countries, can skip the stage of capitalist development and move towards the Soviet system, and after a certain stage of development, they can move towards communism" [Note 3]. The development of the Mongolian People's Republic is proceeding in accordance with the path pointed out by Lenin.

　　This book can not only enable readers to understand the entire picture of the history of Mongolia in various periods before and after the revolution, but also enable readers to learn how to analyze history. It should be pointed out that this book still has some shortcomings, as Tsapkin and Yulev pointed out in their book review: it is inappropriate that it did not open a separate chapter on the impact of the victory of the socialist revolution on Mongolia, but included it in a chapter on the autonomous Mongolia period. In addition, the author overemphasized the death of Bogda Khan, a representative figure of the feudal class (page 157), believing that the death of Bogda Khan solved the problem of the transition from monarchy to republic, which is also inappropriate, because Bogda Khan was already playing an unimportant role at the time. The solution to the problem of the transition from monarchy to republic was not the death of Bogda Khan, but the awakening of the Mongolian people and the help of the Soviet people. Tsapkin and Yulev's book review believes that although this book has some shortcomings, it is still a very valuable book.

    介绍“蒙古人民共和国发展史”
    许力以
    苏联　兹拉特金著　陈大维译　时代出版社一九五二年六月初版
    苏联科学院出版社一九五○年出版的“蒙古人民共和国发展史”，是苏联第一部全面论述现代蒙古历史的著作。“这本书所以特别有价值，是因为它破天荒第一次在我国文献中十分详尽地全面地阐明了近代和现代的蒙古史”。这是察普金和尤烈夫在一九五一年六月号苏联“历史问题”杂志上评述“蒙古人民共和国发展史”时所作出的恰当的评语。
    兹拉特金是从分析革命前蒙古的社会经济结构和阶级关系着手来写这本书的。作者指出：革命前蒙古的经济还是停滞在自然经济阶段，手工业只是在萌芽状态中。当时由于中国与俄国商业高利贷资本的侵入，蒙古境内开始出现了中国商人和俄国商人的小手工业工场和家庭手工业，但是因为中国商人和俄国商人把榨取来的利润并不留在蒙古去发展蒙古的经济，而是运到国外，因此中国商人和俄国商人的小手工业工场和家庭手工业并没有促进蒙古经济的发展。革命前的蒙古，封建主依靠着牧场的所有权，规定了种种经济的或超经济的剥削制度，使牧奴永远束缚在封建主的土地上。封建主“对阿拉特〔注一〕的劳动剥削制度，是革命前封建蒙古的经济基础”。
    革命前蒙古人民因不堪满清王朝和中国商业高利贷资本的压迫，曾经掀起民族解放运动。在一九一二年，蒙古人民和中国辛亥革命反满斗争的胜利同时，摆脱了满清的枷锁，曾经取得了蒙古自治政权，但是因为封建主篡夺了人民的胜利果实，蒙古人民的生活状况和社会经济基础，并没有得到改变。
    革命前蒙古的阶级矛盾已经达到尖锐的程度，封建主对人民的压迫，使人民不能照样生活下去。因此国内直接革命的形势已经成熟。但作者同时指出：俄国社会主义革命的胜利，造成了蒙古人民取得革命胜利的客观可能性。蒙古人民吸取了俄国革命的经验，组织了蒙古人民的革命政党——人民党〔注二〕；并在人民党的领导下，举行了武装起义。最后在苏联红军直接帮助下，蒙古人民取得了革命胜利。
    蒙古人民共和国的成立，是蒙古历史上伟大的变革，它把蒙古截然划分为两个时代。作者按照蒙古共和国发展的历史时期，分为几个阶段来论述。第一个阶段是一九二一年至一九二四年。在这一个时期，镇压反革命分子的反抗，成为党和政府的重要任务。第二阶段是从一九二四年至一九三二年。这一时期，由于蒙古人民共和国取消了封建阶级的特权，消灭了外国商业高利贷资本，使蒙古自由牧民的畜牧经济得到大量发展，而一部分富裕的牧民则发展了雇佣劳动的畜牧经济，因而蒙古便开始产生了资本主义。作者在分析这一时期的蒙古社会经济状况时，着重地论述了蒙古人民革命党为克服党内右倾复辟派和“左倾”分子的错误政策而进行的斗争。右倾分子过低估计了封建势力的反抗和资本主义成分成长的危害性，“左倾”冒险主义者否认蒙古要经过长期的改造工作，而企图立即消灭资本主义，直接进入社会主义建设阶段。
    本书第四章，论述了蒙古人民共和国第三个阶段，即从一九三二年至一九四○年。这一时期，蒙古在党的正确政治路线指导下，获得了辉煌的成就。封建阶级被消灭了，国家完全掌握了经济命脉，进行了工业建设。在一九三八年，蒙古人民共和国的工业生产已供应了国内市场全部商品需要的百分之二十五。这时国家的经济成分已经起了根本变化，自然经济已经不再是国家经济中占优势的经济成分，而占优势的经济成分却是小商品经济。在工业、机械化运输业和商业中占绝对压倒优势的国营和合作社的经济成分日益壮大，成了强大的因素。私人资本主义经济曾得到相当发展，但它是处在国营经济监督之下的。到一九四○年时，蒙古人民共和国已经奠定了新经济制度的基础，国家已经稳步走上非资本主义的发展道路。
    作者在最后一章中叙述了蒙古人民共和国成立以来各方面获得的伟大成就，并阐明蒙古从一九四○年起正在越过资本主义阶段，向社会主义的道路前进。蒙古在革命前还是一个落后的游牧民族，现在却变成了一个先进的人民民主国家。革命前蒙古没有自己的工业和农业。蒙古人民差不多全是文盲，全国只有一所贵族学校。当时既没有医生，又没有兽医，也没有筑过公路，即使泥土铺的大道都没有过，运输只是靠牛马和骆驼。现在的蒙古面貌却完全改变了，全国开设了机器、电业、羊毛等大规模的工厂，地下富藏也正在开发，已经出产了上等的煤。在苏联先进经验指导下，开辟了戈壁沙漠，并在全国和戈壁沙漠建立了机器租赁网、兽医网。随着公路的开辟，现代化汽车运输已经建立，并在各地设立了电报、电话，特别有意义的，是从乌兰巴托到苏联铺设了一条铁路。现在全国已有四百二十八所学校，文盲将全部扫除，全国出版了八种中央报纸和十九种地方报纸，而且用蒙文出版了许多马克思列宁主义的著作。蒙古从落后的游牧民族飞跃到先进的人民民主国家，这是世界历史上从来没有过的事情。为什么蒙古会有这种飞跃呢？作者指出：苏联人民对蒙古人民的帮助“起着决定性的作用”。
    本书全面论述了蒙古人民共和国各个时期的历史之后，总结了蒙古人民共和国的斗争经验。作者指出：在新的历史条件下，落后国家靠着苏联的帮助，是能够越过资本主义阶段，而向社会主义发展的。蒙古人民共和国的经验完全证明了列宁的论断。一九二○年七月列宁在共产国际第二次大会上演讲时说：“如果革命的胜利的无产阶级对那些民族进行有系统的宣传，而苏维埃政府尽其所能去援助他们，那么认为资本主义的发展阶段对于落后民族是不可避免的说法，就是不正确的了。……落后国家得到先进国家的无产阶级的援助，就能够越过资本主义的发展阶段而走向苏维埃制度，再经过一定的发展阶段就可以向共产主义前进”〔注三〕。蒙古人民共和国的发展，正是依照着列宁所指的道路前进。
    这本书不仅可以使读者了解蒙古革命前后各个时期历史的全貌，而且可以使读者学会怎么分析历史。应该指出，这本书还存在着一些缺点，正如察普金和尤烈夫在其书评中所指出的：它没有把社会主义革命的胜利对蒙古的影响另外开辟一章，而是把它列入自治蒙古时期的一章，这是不妥当的。另外，作者过分重视了封建阶级的代表人物博克多格根之死（一五七页），认为博克多格根之死解决了君主政体过渡到共和国的问题，这也是不妥当的，因为博克多格根在当时已经扮演着不关重要的脚色，解决君主政体过渡到共和国的问题不是博克多格根之死，而是蒙古人民的觉悟和苏联人民的帮助。察普金和尤烈夫的书评中认为这本书虽然有一些缺点，但是它仍不失为一本很有价值的书。
