    Commemorating the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising Army Day
    He Long
    The "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising is the anniversary of the birth of the Chinese People's Army; it marks the first time the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, independently took up arms, organized a people's army, and fought back against the betrayal of the Kuomintang reactionaries at the time, initiating a new stage in the Chinese revolution with armed struggle as the main form of struggle.

    The enemies of the Chinese revolution are the united forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. They not only possess a massive counter-revolutionary army, but also have rich experience in reactionary rule. In the face of such an extraordinarily powerful enemy, the Chinese people could not achieve victory and liberation without taking up arms and engaging in a resolute armed struggle against the enemy. Therefore, the main form of the Chinese revolutionary struggle could not be other than "armed revolution against armed counter-revolution," as Chairman Mao said: "In China, without armed struggle, there would be no status for the proletariat, no status for the people, no status for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." However, during the First Revolutionary Civil War, because our Party was still young at the time, the entire Party did not thoroughly understand the importance of armed struggle, nor did it fully understand the importance of organizing and leading a people's army. In particular, the erroneous leadership and shameful surrender policy of the opportunists in the later stage of the revolution allowed the Chinese landlords and big bourgeoisie, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, to carry out counter-revolutionary betrayal without restraint, and we failed to carry out effective counterattacks in time, thus leading to the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War. At the critical moment when the revolution suffered setbacks, Chairman Mao represented the aspirations of the Chinese people and strongly advocated launching and arming the workers and peasants without restraint, using armed struggle to launch a powerful counterattack against the counter-revolution, and promoting the continued development of the revolution. Based on this correct ideological foundation, the "August 1st" Nanchang armed uprising and the subsequent armed uprisings in various places broke out. The armies that emerged from these uprisings were the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army during the Anti-Japanese War, and the current Chinese People's Liberation Army. In China, since the emergence of such a brand-new people's army, the wheel of the Chinese revolution has been pushed forward to a new historical period.

    Our People's Army, from small to large, from weak to strong, has developed into today's powerful and invincible Chinese People's Liberation Army, and has experienced an extraordinarily arduous and extraordinarily tortuous road. It has experienced victories and failures, successes and setbacks; it has grown stronger by constantly defeating the attacks of powerful enemies and constantly overcoming the mistakes of various opportunists. The main reason why our People's Army has the strength to continuously overcome serious difficulties and achieve continuous victories, and even liberate all of China, is that since the day this army was born, it has had the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and has maintained flesh-and-blood ties with the broad masses. In summarizing the experience of revolution and war, Chairman Mao quickly created a complete military line to guide the Chinese revolution to victory. In army building, we have a strong leadership with the Communist Party at its core, established strong political work and strict mass discipline, and implemented the people's war line relying on the masses. In war guidance, Chairman Mao has wisely stipulated the guiding principles of strategic tactics that are completely suitable for the laws of the Chinese revolutionary war in various periods of the revolutionary war, so that we can gradually understand and master the art of revolutionary war. In the entire revolutionary struggle, we have adopted armed struggle as the main form, but also correctly launched and combined other aspects of struggle, such as the struggles of workers, peasants, youth, students, women, etc., especially the peasants' land struggle and the anti-imperialist struggle of the entire people, so that they support each other and form a great revolutionary movement of the entire nation. It is precisely because we have Chairman Mao's correct line and the Party and the army's serious implementation and firm execution of this line that the People's Army has been able to grow and become strong, and the victory on a national scale has been achieved. The experience of more than 20 years of revolutionary struggle tells us that wherever and whenever Mao Zedong's correct line is resolutely implemented, the revolutionary forces will develop and the revolutionary struggle will be victorious; whenever Mao Zedong's correct line is deviated from, the revolutionary forces will suffer losses, and even the revolution will move towards failure.

    Our Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the cultivation and education of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, has always been an army with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. Currently, when American imperialism is plotting to expand the Korean War, refusing armistice negotiations, using bacteriological weapons, reviving Japanese and West German militarism, organizing the "European Army Group," and vainly attempting to launch another new world war, thus seriously threatening peace in the East and the world, when we commemorate the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising and the Army Day of our army, our important task is to step up our study and strive to implement Chairman Mao's political and military line, continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of our army's heroic and arduous struggle, unremittingly improve the political and cultural level and military technology of the troops, accelerate the construction of a regular and modernized national defense army, and vigilantly defend the security of our great motherland and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the creator and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

    纪念“八一”南昌起义建军节
    贺龙
    “八一”南昌起义，是中国人民军队诞生的纪念日；是中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，第一次独立地拿起武器，组织人民军队，反击当时国民党反动派的叛变，并开始了中国革命以武装斗争为主要斗争形式的新的阶段。
    中国革命的敌人是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的联合力量。它们不但具有庞大的反革命军队，而且还具有丰富的反动统治经验。在这样异常强大的敌人面前，中国人民如果不拿起武器和敌人进行坚决的武装斗争，就不能够取得胜利和解放，所以中国革命斗争的主要形式，就不能不是“武装的革命反对武装的反革命”，正如毛主席所说的：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”但是，在第一次国内革命战争时期，由于我们党在当时还很年轻，就全党来说，还没有彻底了解武装斗争的重要性，还没有完全懂得组织与领导人民军队的重要性；特别是革命后期机会主义者的错误领导及其可耻的投降政策，使以蒋介石为首的中国大地主、大资产阶级得以放手进行反革命的叛变，而我们则未能及时进行有效的反击，因而招致了第一次国内革命战争的失败。在革命遭受挫折的紧要关头，毛主席代表了中国人民的愿望，极力主张放手发动和武装工农群众，以武装斗争向反革命进行有力的反击，推动了革命继续向前发展。在这样正确的思想基础之上，就爆发了“八一”南昌武装起义，和相随而来的各地的武装起义。在这些起义当中所产生的军队，就是第二次国内革命战争时期的中国工农红军，抗日时期的八路军、新四军，和现在的中国人民解放军。在中国，自从出现了这样一支崭新的人民军队以后，就将中国革命的车轮向前推到了一新的历史时期。
    我们人民军队由小到大，由弱到强，一直发展成为今天这样强大无敌的中国人民解放军，是经历过一条异常艰苦和异常曲折的道路的。它经历过胜利和失败，成功和挫折；它是在不断地战胜强大敌人的进攻，和不断地克服各种机会主义者的错误当中成长壮大起来的。我们这支人民军队之所以有力量能不断地克服严重的困难，而取得连续的胜利，以至解放全中国的主要原因，就是由于这支军队自从产生的那一天起，就有着中国共产党的领导，就有着毛主席、朱总司令的英明领导，并和广大群众有着血肉的联系。毛主席在总结革命和战争的经验当中，迅速地创造了一条指导中国革命走向胜利的完整的军事路线。在军队建设上，我们有着以共产党为核心的坚强领导，建立了坚强的政治工作和严明的群众纪律，实行了依靠群众的人民战争路线。在战争指导上，在革命战争的各个时期，毛主席都英明地规定了完全适合于中国革命战争规律的战略战术的指导原则，从而使我们能够逐渐体会和掌握了革命战争的艺术。在整个革命斗争上，采取了以武装斗争为主，但又正确发动与结合了其他各方面的斗争，如工人、农民、青年、学生、妇女等方面的斗争，特别是农民的土地斗争与全体人民的反帝斗争，使其互相支援，形成全国人民的大革命运动。正是由于我们有了毛主席这样一条正确的路线，和全党全军对于这一条路线的认真贯彻和坚决执行，人民军队才得以成长壮大，全国范围的胜利才得实现。二十多年革命斗争的经验告诉我们：无论那一个地区和那一个时期，凡是坚决执行毛主席正确路线的时候，革命力量就得到发展，革命斗争就得到胜利；凡是离开了毛主席正确路线的时候，都会使革命力量遭受损失，甚至使革命走向失败。
    我们中国人民解放军，在中国共产党和毛主席的培养教育下，历来就是具有高度爱国主义和国际主义精神的军队。目前，正当美帝国主义阴谋扩大朝鲜战争，拒绝停战谈判，使用细菌武器，复活日本和西德的军国主义，组织“欧洲集团军”，妄图发起再一次的新的世界大战，因而使东方与世界和平仍然受着严重威胁的时候，我们来纪念“八一”南昌起义和我军的建军节日，我们的重要任务，就是要加紧学习和努力贯彻毛主席的政治、军事路线，继续发扬我军英勇艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，毫不懈怠地提高部队的政治文化水平和军事技术，加速正规化、现代化国防军的建设，警惕地保卫我们伟大祖国的安全，保卫远东与世界的和平。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    强大的中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民解放军的创造者与领导者毛主席万岁！
