    The recent announcement by the British and French governments that they are unable to complete the U.S.-mandated arms expansion plan reflects the outcome of Western European countries following the U.S. war policy, which has created a serious domestic economic crisis; the U.S.'s war preparation plan in Western Europe has obviously encountered insurmountable difficulties.

    In the years since the war, Western European countries have been exhausted in order to cope with the frantic war preparation plan, especially the United Kingdom and France. The economic situation in these two countries has now become so critical that the British government has had to announce a delay in the speed of military expansion and adopt so-called "emergency measures" to increase exports and further reduce imports in an attempt to save the crisis; the French government relies on American "military aid," and when its request for military orders from the United States was rejected, it panicked and shouted that it "cannot fulfill the promises of the Lisbon Conference."

    If the British and French governments continue to implement the U.S. war preparation plan, and continue to depend on and submit to the United States, it is fundamentally impossible for them to escape the economic crisis. The British government's so-called "emergency measures" are just a way to force the people to tighten their belts even more. Since Churchill came to power, he has implemented similar so-called "super-saving" plans, but the result was only to push Britain into deeper disaster, and this time will naturally not improve its situation. The crux of the British economy, like other Western European countries, lies in the fact that most of its materials and manpower are consumed for non-productive purposes, resulting in inflation, imbalances in national revenue and expenditure, and increasing deficits in international payments. If the British government further reduces imports, it will further reduce the food and daily necessities on the domestic market, which will inevitably further reduce the living standards of the people, worsen inflation, continue to rise prices, and increase the fiscal deficit. On the other hand, due to the United States monopolizing the market of the capitalist world, restricting trade between countries and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and the British federal countries adopting self-defense policies to reduce imports in order to balance their budgets, Britain's prospects for making up for the huge consumption of its gold reserves by selling arms and civilian goods are extremely bleak. The British government's "emergency measures" are of no help to the bankrupt British economy. As for the French Binet government, it is placing all its fate on American alms, which is equally hopeless. Due to the huge consumption of the war of aggression against Korea, the burden on the people is already very heavy, and the worker strikes have caused serious losses, so it feels overwhelmed and cannot afford to give a lot of alms. Even if the French government can beg some dollars from the United States, if it is still put into the bottomless pit of military expansion, it will not be of any benefit to the French economic and financial crisis.

    The United States coerced its vassal countries to expand their military forces, originally to enhance their military and economic strength in order to serve its aggressive policies, but the result was the opposite, causing serious economic crises in various countries. This is an insurmountable contradiction of the aggressive bloc.

### 美国在西欧扩军备战政策的失败是无可挽救的

    美国在西欧扩军备战政策的失败是无可挽救的
    英法两国政府最近宣布无力完成美国命令的扩军计划，这反映出西欧各国追随美国战争政策的结果，已造成国内的严重经济危机；美国在西欧推行的备战计划，显然遭到了无法克服的困难。
    战后几年以来，西欧各国为了应付疯狂的备战计划，都已弄得筋疲力竭，尤以英法两国情况最为严重。现在这两个国家的经济情势已危急到这样的程度：英国政府不得不宣布延缓扩张军备的速度，而采取以增加出口和进一步削减入口的所谓“紧急措施”，企图来挽救这种危机；法国政府则指望于美国的“军事援助”，当它向美国乞求军事订单遭到拒绝时，便惊惶失措，嚷叫“不能履行里斯本会议上的诺言了”。
    英法两国政府如果继续执行美国的备战计划，继续依附和屈从美国，它们要想逃避经济的危机，是根本不可能的。英国政府的所谓“紧急措施”，不过是强迫人民把裤带勒得更紧的办法。邱吉尔上台以后，就曾实行过类似的所谓“超级节约”计划，结果只是把英国推向更深的灾难，这一回自然也不会使它的情况好转。英国经济的症结，和其他西欧国家一样，是在于将大部分物资和人力消耗于非生产的目的上，因而造成通货膨胀，国家收支不能平衡和国际收支的日益亏损。英国政府要进一步削减进口，就将使国内市场上的食物和日用品更加减少，结果必将使人民的生活水平进一步降低，通货膨胀愈益恶化，物价继续上升，财政赤字更加增大。另一方面，由于美国垄断着资本主义世界的市场，限制各国对苏联和人民民主国家进行贸易，以及英国的各联邦国家为了平衡预算而采取削减入口的自卫政策，英国想要用推销军火和民用品的办法来弥补其黄金储备的巨大消耗，前途是极为暗淡的。英国政府的“紧急措施”，实无补于面临破产的英国经济。至于法国比内政府的做法，则是把命运全部寄托在美国的施舍上，同样是没有希望的。美国因为侵朝战争的庞大消耗，人民负担已经很重，加以工人罢工造成严重损失，已感自顾不暇，不可能有大量的施舍。就算法国政府能从美国乞取到一些美元，如果仍然投进扩张军备的无底洞中，对于法国的经济财政危机，还是不会有什么补益的。
    美国胁迫各仆从国家扩张军备，目的原是要增强它们的军事和经济力量，以为其侵略政策服务，但结果却适得其反，引起了各国的严重经济危机。这是侵略集团不可克服的矛盾。
