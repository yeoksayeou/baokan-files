Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram on August 7th to Mr. Romesh Chandra, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-India Peace Council and Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, congratulating the Indian Preparatory Committee of the Peace Conference on holding "Asia Week" throughout India. The telegram reads as follows: Mr. Romesh Chandra, Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, India:
    At a time when U.S. imperialism is deliberately delaying the Korean peace talks, actively rearming Japan, and conspiring to expand the Korean War to other parts of Asia, your "Asia Week," held in India from August 3rd to 10th, will have great significance and contribution to promoting the peace movement in India and Asia. We hope that the broad masses of working people in India will actively participate in this "Asia Week" and turn their desire for peace into a powerful force to oppose the war conspiracies of imperialism and defend the lasting peace of Asia and the world. We wish you success in your work.
            Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
