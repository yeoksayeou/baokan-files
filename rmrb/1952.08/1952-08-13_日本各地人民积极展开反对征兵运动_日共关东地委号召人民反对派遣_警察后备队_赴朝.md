Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: During the "Peace Movement Month" from June 25th to August 15th, the Japanese people are striving to promote the anti-conscription movement.

The Comprehensive Reconciliation Patriotic Movement Council (referred to as "Zen'aikyo"), composed of various progressive organizations in Japan to oppose the separate peace treaty, has decided to make the anti-conscription movement its main work during the Peace Movement Month. "Zen'aikyo" believes that the anti-conscription movement must be combined with the movement against rearmament, and has decided to unite the various anti-conscription movements that are being carried out autonomously in various places, and launch a struggle for peace and independence. "Zen'aikyo" has called on the people across the country to actively launch a signature campaign against conscription, collecting at least one signature per person per day, and raising one yen in donations to cover the costs of this movement. "Zen'aikyo" also called on the people in various places to elect, in a democratic manner during signature campaigns and rallies, people who are active in various peace movements as Japanese representatives to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference; "Zen'aikyo" itself will also send representatives. The signature paper printed by "Zen'aikyo" against conscription has the following slogans printed on it: "Asians don't fight Asians"; "Don't be a soldier yourself, and don't make others be soldiers"; "Stop the Korean War"; "Participate in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference."

During the Peace Movement Month, mass rallies were held in Tokyo, Osaka, Akita, Hiroshima, Nagano and other places, gradually expanding the signature campaign against conscription. In Tokyo, the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, the Christian Peace Defense Association, and other organizations have decided that the target for collecting signatures is two million. As of July 8th, 200,000 signatures had been collected in Tokyo. The signature campaign is now continuing to develop. For example, on July 12th, the "Tokyo Mothers' Association" collected 1,300 signatures at Shinjuku Station in just three hours. The "Tokyo Mothers' Association" was established on May 24th, and its members are mainly widows and mothers living in various parts of Tokyo whose husbands and sons died because they were driven by Japanese imperialism to serve as cannon fodder for aggression. At the inaugural meeting of the "Tokyo Mothers' Association," widows and mothers who deeply hated war unanimously resolved to cooperate with trade unions to carry out a movement against the fascist "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" and issued a peace declaration to countries around the world.

In the anti-conscription movement in other places, many activists have also emerged. In Yamamoto Village, Shimoina District, Nagano Prefecture, all members of a youth organization adopted the method of collecting signatures against conscription from house to house, resulting in 1,473 signatures.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: One thousand members of the Japanese "Police Reserve Force" have been sent to the Korean battlefield after being trained in Somagahara, Japan, to serve as cannon fodder for the American aggressors. The Kanto Regional Committee of the Japanese Communist Party has issued a statement on this shameless act of the Yoshida government in sending troops to Korea, calling on the Japanese people to resolutely rise up to fight. The statement pointed out that this is not just a problem for one thousand young people and their families, but a problem for all young people and the people of the whole country. This is an act of destroying Japanese politics, economy, and culture, turning the Japanese nation into slaves, and provoking a new war. All peace-loving people in Japan must resolutely rise up to fight to stop this behavior.

The Japan Democratic Youth League also called on Japanese youth to resolutely oppose being sent to Korea to serve as cannon fodder for the American aggressors, and demanded that Japanese youth fight for the independence and peace of their motherland.

    日本各地人民积极展开反对征兵运动
    日共关东地委号召人民反对派遣“警察后备队”赴朝
    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：在六月二十五日到八月十五日的“和平运动月”中，日本人民正在努力地推进反对征兵运动。
    日本的各进步组织为了反对单独和约而组成的全面媾和爱国运动协议会（简称“全爱协”），已决定以反对征兵运动为它在和平运动月中的主要工作。“全爱协”认为反对征兵运动必须和反对重整军备的运动结合起来，并决定将各地自主地进行着的各种反对征兵运动统一起来，展开争取和平与独立的斗争。“全爱协”已经号召全国人民积极展开征集反对征兵的签名运动，每人每天至少征集一个签名，并征募一日元的捐款，作为进行这个运动的费用。“全爱协”并号召各地人民在签名运动和集会中，以民主的方式选举在各种和平运动中积极活动的人为参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的日本代表，“全爱协”本身也将选派代表。“全爱协”所印发的反对征兵的签名用纸印有下列口号：“亚洲人不打亚洲人”；“自己不当兵，也不使别人当兵”；“制止朝鲜战争”；“参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”。
    在和平运动月期间，东京、大阪、秋田、广岛、长野等地，纷纷举行群众大会，逐渐扩大反对征兵的签名运动。在东京，全日本学生自治会联合会、基督教徒保卫和平会等团体，已经决定征集签名的目标是二百万个。截至七月八日为止，东京已经征集了二十万个签名。现在签名运动正在继续发展中。例如，七月十二日，“东京母亲会”仅仅在三小时之内就在新宿车站征集到一千三百个签名。“东京母亲会”是在五月二十四日成立的，会员主要是居住在东京各地的寡妇和母亲，她们的丈夫和儿子因为被日本帝国主义驱使充当侵略炮灰而死亡。在“东京母亲会”的成立大会上，对战争深恶痛绝的寡妇和母亲曾一致决议要和工会合作，开展反对法西斯的“防止破坏活动法”的运动，并向世界各国发出和平宣言。
    在其他各地的反对征兵运动中，也涌现出许多积极分子。在长野县下伊那郡山本村，一个青年组织的全体成员采取了挨户征集反对征兵的签名的办法，结果征集到一千四百七十三个签名。
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：日本“警察后备队”一千人在日本相马原受训之后已被送往朝鲜战场，充当美国侵略者的炮灰。日本共产党关东地方委员会特对吉田政府这种出兵朝鲜的无耻行为发表声明，号召日本人民坚决起来斗争。声明指出：这不只是一千名青年及其家属的问题，而是关系全国青年和全国人民的问题。这是破坏日本政治、经济、文化，变日本民族为奴隶，挑拨新战争的行为。日本的一切爱好和平的人必须为阻止这种行为而坚决起来斗争。
    日本民主青年团也号召日本青年坚决反对被送去朝鲜充当美国侵略者的炮灰，要求日本青年为争取祖国的独立与和平而斗争。
