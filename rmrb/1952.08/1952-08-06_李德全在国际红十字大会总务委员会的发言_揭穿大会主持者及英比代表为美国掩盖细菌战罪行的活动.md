Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 5th - Li Dequan, Chief Delegate of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation, in her speech at the final meeting of the General Committee of the International Red Cross Conference on the 2nd, regarding the British and Belgian proposal for an investigation of accusations of germ warfare, thoroughly exposed the injustice of the conference presiding officers and the conspiracy of Britain, Belgium, and other countries to cover up the crimes of the US aggressors. The full text of Li Dequan's speech is as follows:
	We have repeatedly denounced the atrocities of the US military in Korea on this platform, such as the massacre of civilians, the abuse and killing of prisoners of war, and the waging of germ warfare. However, every time we raised accusations, we were either accused of "disrupting order" or simply dismissed as engaging in "political propaganda." What is particularly serious is that the conference authorities have formally notified our Chinese delegation that they are unwilling to technically assist us in presenting our evidence. On the other hand, there are those who are constantly talking about conducting a so-called fair investigation. Ladies and gentlemen, please take a look: some people clearly have evidence right in front of their noses, but they are unwilling to look at it, and instead enthusiastically prattle about conducting an investigation thousands of miles away. Isn't this ridiculous?
	Mr. Chairman, I would like to make one point very clear. Truth is on our side, so we never refuse any truly fair, impartial, sincere, and independent international individuals or groups to come here to investigate the atrocities of the US military. In fact, over the past two years, many such groups and individuals have come, investigated various atrocities, especially the evidence of germ warfare, and published reports after returning. All reports based on irrefutable evidence prove that our accusations against the US military's atrocities and germ warfare are true in every sense of the word. However, what has been the result? Without exception, anyone who dares to speak the truth and actual observations with conscience is persecuted by their own government. This proves that those who are afraid of investigation and determined to obstruct any real and fair investigation are none other than the criminals and their accomplices.
	I would also like to make another point very clear. First, the Chinese delegation believes that, for obvious military security reasons, the Korean and Chinese people are determined to reject any individuals or groups who are merely tools of certain countries, such as the International Committee under the leadership of Ruegger, from conducting investigations. Second, if any investigation is to be correct and effective, it must first be permitted by the governments of Korea and China, and the investigators must be individuals whom the two victimized countries of Korea and China consider to be fair, and all their activities must be attended by representatives of the two victimized countries of Korea and China. Without these conditions, I believe that there is no guarantee that the investigation can be fair and correct, and therefore the interests of the victimized countries and victimized people cannot be guaranteed.
	However, the real problem does not lie here. The real problem lies in the fact that bringing the British and Belgian proposal, which was sent back by the Legal Subcommittee after research, to the General Committee for discussion is an injustice to the Chinese delegation. Mr. Chairman, didn't the conference reject the accusations of the Chinese and other delegations without detailed discussion? Didn't the conference have no interest in looking at all the conclusive evidence presented by the Chinese delegation? Since the conference has shown such a lack of interest in the conclusive evidence before everyone's eyes and easily rejected our accusations, we simply do not understand why the conference is calling for an investigation thousands of miles away, for what purpose, and for whose benefit?
	I have brought photos of the American soldiers insulting female Korean Red Cross workers. I have brought films and recordings proving the American armed forces' germ warfare. I also have photos and documents about the massacre of prisoners of war in Busan and Geoje Island. But I have not been given the opportunity to submit this evidence to the conference. If the conference is truly concerned about the violation of the Geneva Conventions, concerned about humanitarianism, peace, honor, human conscience, and the future of civilization, then the conference should seriously reconsider the Chinese delegation's proposal to condemn American atrocities and germ warfare, and carefully study all the statements made by the Chinese delegation regarding these acts and all the evidence in its possession. However, the conference is not doing so, and is now indulging in empty talk about investigation. This cannot but make people suspect that a conspiracy is underway, the purpose of which is nothing more than to cover up the terrible crimes of those war profiteers.
	Because we do not agree to regard the International Committee of the Red Cross as an impartial organization, and because we voted against the relevant clauses in Article 7 of the International Red Cross Statutes, we are now not prepared to be bound by the British-Belgian proposal. Our demand is that before the Legal Subcommittee's report is put to a vote, the conference should reconsider the Chinese delegation's proposal, which was rejected on July 30th, that calls for condemnation of American germ warfare, American atrocities, and its violation of the Geneva Conventions. First, the conference should examine the various evidence in our possession that confirms our accusations. Due to the refusal of assistance from the conference authorities, this evidence has not yet had the opportunity to be presented to the conference.
	Finally, I must once again state that the Chinese delegation opposes voting on the British and Belgian proposal studied by the Legal Subcommittee at this time. The conference must reconsider the Chinese proposal and examine the evidence in our possession.

    李德全在国际红十字大会总务委员会的发言
    揭穿大会主持者及英比代表为美国掩盖细菌战罪行的活动
    【新华社多伦多五日电】中国红十字会代表团首席代表李德全，在二日国际红十字大会总务委员会最后一次会议上就英国和比利时的所谓调查细菌战指责的提案所作的发言，彻底揭穿了大会主持者的不公正，及英比等国企图为美国侵略者掩盖罪行的阴谋。李德全的发言全文如下：
    我们在这讲台上曾经一再控诉在朝鲜的美国军队的暴行，如屠杀平民、虐待和屠杀战俘、进行细菌战等等。可是，每当我们提出控告时，我们不是被指责为“扰乱秩序”，就是干脆被当作进行“政治宣传”而轻轻对付过去。尤其严重的是，会议当局已经正式通知我们中国代表团，表示不愿意在技术上协助我们提出我们的证据。然而，在另一方面，还有人不断地谈论着进行所谓公正的调查。诸位女士，诸位先生，请看一看，有些人他们明明鼻子前面就摆着证据，他们都不愿意看，而是一股劲夸夸其谈，主张到几千里外进行调查，这岂不是很滑稽的吗？
    主席，我愿意十分明白地说明一点。真理在我们这一边，因此我们从来不拒绝任何的确公正无私、诚恳和独立的国际人士到我们这里来调查美军的暴行。事实上，过去两年来，也的确有过许多这类的团体和个人来过，调查了各种暴行，特别是细菌战的罪证，他们并在回去之后发表了报告。一切以无可辩驳的证据为根据的报告都证明，我们对美军暴行及细菌战的指责，无论在那一个意义上来说，都是千真万确的。然而，结果怎样呢？任何敢于凭着良心说出真相和实际的见闻的人，毫无例外，一概遭到他的本国政府的迫害。这就证明害怕调查，决心阻挠任何真正的公正调查的，不是别人，恰恰是那些罪犯和他们的同谋者。
    我还要十分明白地说明另一点。首先，中国代表认为，由于显而易见的军事安全上的原因，朝鲜和中国人民决计拒绝任何只不过是某些国家御用的工具的个人或团体进行调查，如吕格领导下的国际委员会之类。第二，任何调查如果要想能够正确有效，首先必须得到朝鲜和中国政府的允许，而且进行调查的人也必须是朝中两个受害国认为公正的人士，其一切活动必须有朝中两个受害国的代表参加。假如没有这几个条件，我认为，调查是否能够公正和正确，就无法有保障，因此也就不能保障受害国和受害人民的利益。
    然而，真正的问题还不在这里。真正的问题是在于这样一个事实：把法律小组委员会经过研究后送回来的英国和比利时的提案提到总务委员会来讨论，是对中国代表团的一种不公正的行为。主席先生，难道大会不是未经详尽讨论就否决了中国和其他国家代表团的指责吗？难道大会不是没有兴趣来看看中国代表团所提出的一切确凿证据吗？既然大会对于这些摆在每个人眼前的确凿证据这样没有兴趣，而且轻易地否决了我们的指责，我们简直不明白大会要求到数千里外去进行调查，是为了什么目的，为了谁的利益？
    我带着关于美国士兵侮辱朝鲜红十字会女工作者情形的照片。我带着证明美国武装部队进行细菌战的电影和录音。我也带着关于屠杀釜山和巨济岛战俘的照片和文件。但是我没有得到机会来把这些证据提交给大会。如果大会真是关心日内瓦公约的被破坏，关切人道主义、和平、光荣和人类的良心以及未来的文明的话，那么，大会应当认真地重新考虑中国代表团所提出的谴责美国暴行和细菌战的提案，并仔细地研究中国代表团就这些行为所发表的一切声明和所掌握的一切证据。可是，大会不这样做，现在却大肆空谈什么调查。这就不能不使人怀疑：是不是正在进行一种阴谋，这阴谋的目的不是为了别的，只不过是为了掩盖那些战争贩子们的可怕罪行。
    因为我们不同意把红十字国际委员会当做公正的组织，因为我们投票反对国际红十字章程第七条中的有关条款，我们现在不准备受英比提案的约束。我们的要求是：在法律小组委员会的报告提付表决以前，大会应当重新考虑中国代表团所提出的而在七月三十日被否决了的提案，这个提案要求谴责美国的细菌战、美国的暴行及其破坏日内瓦公约。首先，大会应当审查我们所握有的证实我们的控诉的各种证据。由于大会当局拒绝给予协助，这些证据迄今还没有机会公诸大会。
    最后，我必须再一次声明：中国代表团反对在现在就对法律小组委员会所研究过的英、比提案加以表决，大会必须重新考虑中国提案并审查我们所握有的证据。
