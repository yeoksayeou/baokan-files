    Experience in Timely Summarization, Dissemination and Promotion of Advanced Experience
    Since the launch of the national campaign for increased production and economy, workers in various regions have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and created many advanced experiences. However, how to systematically, organizationally, and with leadership promote these experiences; where to start when promoting advanced experiences; and what problems should be addressed? There is still a significant lack of experience in this area. Some leading cadres simply issue general calls to promote advanced experiences without doing concrete work; some are satisfied with a set of formalistic methods without paying attention to the actual results of the work; some even use crude methods to force workers to promote advanced experiences. These practices are clearly very wrong, and therefore cannot make the promotion of advanced experiences a mass movement.
    In order to introduce methods for promoting advanced experiences, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions promptly studied and summarized the example of a certain factory, pointed out a concrete path for promoting advanced experiences, and convened a conference of cadres from trade unions in various provinces and cities to disseminate it. This approach is absolutely necessary and is a good way to help factories and mines further promote advanced experiences.
    The experience of a certain factory shows that as a leading cadre of a factory or mine, one should treat the advanced experiences of the masses with great seriousness. They should carefully and thoroughly resolve the various ideological concerns of the masses, and turn the process of promoting advanced experiences into a process of mass self-education. Their experience is not only the most practical education for factories and mines in the Northeast; leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises across the country should also learn this leadership method to further advance the work of promoting advanced experiences.

    及时总结和传播推广先进经验的经验
    全国性的增产节约运动开展以来，各地职工发挥了高度的积极性，创造了许多先进经验。但是，如何将这些经验有计划、有组织、有领导地加以推广呢，在推广先进经验时应该从何着手，应该注意解决一些什么问题呢？这一方面的经验，还极为缺乏。有的领导干部只一般地号召推广先进经验，不作具体工作；有的满足于形式主义的一套方法，不注意工作的实际效果；甚至有的以粗暴的方式，强迫工人推广先进经验。这些作法，显然是十分错误的，因而也就不能使推广先进经验形成群众运动。
    为了介绍推广先进经验的方法，东北总工会用某工厂的实例，及时加以研究和总结，指出了一个推广先进经验的具体道路，并召集各省市各产业工会干部会议加以传播。这种作法是完全必要的，这是帮助各厂矿企业进一步推广先进经验的好办法。
    某工厂的经验说明了：作为一个厂、矿的领导干部，应十分严肃地对待群众的先进经验。应细致地、深入地解决群众的各种思想顾虑，把推广先进经验的过程，变成群众的自我教育的过程。他们的经验，不仅对东北各厂、矿是最切实的教育；全国各地工矿企业领导干部，也应学习这种领导方法，把推广先进经验的工作提高一步。
