Reactionary Old Laws Are Absolutely Incompatible with the People's Revolutionary Regime
Chen Chuangang

The laws of the exploiting classes throughout history, regardless of time or place, have invariably been based on hostility and suppression of the exploited classes. To make their system of exploitation and class privileges sacred and inviolable, they fabricate the lie that their reactionary rule is "legal" and "orthodox." This is the secret of the so-called "legal system" of the exploiting classes throughout history.

Despite the differences in the forms of expression of the laws and judicial systems of the exploiting classes in various eras and countries of class society, due to the changing forms of exploitation, their basic content—"the rich control the law, and the law oppresses the poor"—is absolutely consistent. Therefore, they can plagiarize and inherit from each other. As Engels said in "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy": The English bourgeoisie can preserve most of the old feudal legal system, insert capitalist content into it, and even directly add bourgeois meanings to feudal names. In the countries of Western Europe, it is possible to base it on the same Roman law (the first worldwide legal system of commodity producers), and only make more precise formulations, or only make it suitable for the reality of semi-feudal society in judicial practice (such as All-German Law), or give it a makeover to adapt to the aforementioned social state (such as the Prussian Land Law), or appear as a "legal compendium" of a typical bourgeois society (such as the French Napoleonic Code). Similarly, the Manchu Qing government in old China could copy the Japanese criminal law and draft the "New Criminal Law" while maintaining its feudal rule; after the Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Warlord government could announce the adoption of the Manchu Qing New Criminal Law; and the Kuomintang reactionary government could copy the legal systems of Fascist countries such as Germany, Japan, Poland, and Spain, and still cite the precedents of the Supreme Court of the Northern Government as golden rules. The reason is simple: they are all based on hostility and suppression of the exploited classes.

Can the people's revolutionary regime led by the proletariat copy or inherit the laws and judicial systems of the exploiting classes? Absolutely not. Comrade Stalin pointed out when discussing the difference between the proletarian revolution and the bourgeois revolution: "The bourgeois revolution is limited to replacing one group of exploiters with another to take power, so it does not need to break the old state machine; while the proletarian revolution wants to overthrow all groups of exploiters from the peak of power and make the leaders of all the exploited working masses, that is, the proletariat, take power, so it must break the old state machine and replace it with a new one." ("Problems of Leninism," page 166) The Chinese New Democratic Revolution is a part of the proletarian socialist world revolution, and the Chinese people's revolutionary regime is a people's democratic regime led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance. Although in the current stage of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, it is not about eliminating all systems of exploitation, but only eliminating the systems of exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and allowing a certain degree of capitalist exploitation within the scope that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and ensures the leadership of the state-owned economy of a socialist nature, its ultimate goal is to move towards the elimination of all systems of exploitation and towards a socialist and communist society. Therefore, all reactionary old legal systems that take consolidating the system of exploitation as their historical mission are obviously absolutely incompatible with the people's revolutionary regime that takes eliminating all systems of exploitation as its ultimate goal.

Just as the relations of production of New Democracy and Socialism cannot grow in the womb of capitalist society, the new legal system of the people's revolution cannot grow on the basis of the reactionary legal system of the landlord-comprador bourgeoisie, but can only grow after completely breaking its cage.

As early as 1871, Marx pointed out based on the experience of the Paris Commune: The working class cannot simply seize the ready-made state machine (that is, the bureaucratic militarist machine) and use it to achieve its own goals, but must completely smash it. (The Civil War in France, pages 103-104) Lenin clearly pointed out in the program of the provisional revolutionary government he formulated in 1905: All reactionary and anti-people old laws must be immediately abolished. (Selected Works of Lenin, Volume 6, page 41) Chairman Mao pointed out in his statement on the current situation on January 14, 1949, that the abolition of the Kuomintang's false legal system should be one of the eight peace conditions. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued "Instructions on Abolishing the Kuomintang's Six Codes and Determining the Principles of the People's Judicial Work" in February of the same year. The General Program, the great charter of the Chinese People's Revolution, Article 17, clearly stipulates: "Abolish all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppress the people, formulate laws and decrees to protect the people, and establish a people's judicial system." This is fully in line with the requirements of the Chinese People's Revolution and in line with the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism.

Can the people's revolutionary regime recognize the anti-people and counter-revolutionary regime and its laws? Absolutely not. Lenin said that the people's revolutionary regime led by the proletariat "is a revolutionary dictatorship, that is, a regime that directly relies on revolutionary means of seizure, relies on the people's direct initiative from below, rather than a regime based on laws promulgated by a centralized state power (note: refers to the state power of Tsarist autocracy)." (On the Situation of Two Powers Coexisting – "Selected Works of Lenin" Volume 2, page 23) Therefore, it "does not recognize any other power or any laws, and does not recognize any norms set by anyone." ("On the History of the Problem of Dictatorship" – "Selected Works of Lenin" Volume 12, page 288)

Can the old courts of the bourgeoisie be improved by the people's revolutionary regime without completely destroying them? Absolutely not. Lenin pointed out in his report on the work of the People's Committee in January 1918: "The policy adopted by the Soviet regime in terms of the socialist army has also been applied to another more sophisticated and complex tool of the ruling class—the bourgeois court. The bourgeois court pretends to maintain order, but in reality, it is a blind and sophisticated tool for ruthlessly suppressing the exploited to protect the interests of wallets. The Soviet regime has acted in accordance with the legacy of successive proletarian revolutions—abolishing the old court at once. Let people shout that we did not improve the old court, but abolished it at once. We have cleared the way to create a truly people's court." ("Selected Works of Lenin" Volume 13, page 19) In the article "The Current Tasks of the Soviet Regime" in April of the same year, Lenin pointed out again: "The revolutionary masses took the correct path after October 25, 1917, and proved the vitality of the revolution. Before any decree was promulgated to dissolve the bourgeois bureaucratic judicial organs, they had already begun to organize their own, that is, the worker-peasant courts." ("Selected Works of Lenin" Volume 2, page 396) It can be seen that the revolutionary people's court and the counter-revolutionary old court have no blood relationship of "inheritance." Our Chinese people's judicial organs are also like this. They were established long before the announcement of the abolition of the Kuomintang's false legal system and have never had any connection or involvement with the Kuomintang's reactionary judicial organs.

"Doesn't Marxism say that old heritage can be critically accepted? Why can't the Kuomintang's Six Codes be critically accepted?" Yes, Marxism does say that old heritage should be critically accepted. Marxism itself is "the natural successor to the excellent achievements created by mankind in the nineteenth century, namely German philosophy, British political economy, and French socialism." (Lenin: "The Three Sources and Three Components of Marxism" – On Marx, Engels, and Marxism, pages 64-65). But is any old heritage to be "critically accepted"? Absolutely not. Lenin pointed out in his article "What Kind of Heritage Do We Reject?" written in 1897: The heritage that Marxists want to critically accept is only "the heritage of general enlightenment, the heritage of people who take an absolutely hostile attitude towards everything before the reform, and the heritage of people who support Western European ideals and the interests of the broad masses." (Original book, pages 51, 52) rather than the heritage of the Populists—that is, some remnants of the feudal system. Are the Kuomintang's Six Codes a "heritage" that we should critically accept? Absolutely not. The Kuomintang's Six Codes is a code that concentrates the anti-people and counter-revolutionary laws of feudal compradores of Fascism from ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. If the Chinese people do not want to take the enemy's knife to cut off their own heads, and do not want to pick up the old shackles that have been broken and put them back on their necks, then they should abolish it completely without reservation.

Contrary to the Kuomintang reactionary group's inheritance of the counter-revolutionary tradition of feudal comprador classes such as Zeng Guofan and Yuan Shikai selling out the motherland and harming the people internally, the tradition that the Chinese people have inherited and carried forward under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is the incomplete revolutionary tradition from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to the First Domestic Revolutionary War, and the completely revolutionary new tradition gradually established with a completely new style of revolutionary struggle after the Chinese people established their own revolutionary regime, that is, the revolutionary legal system. (See the Xinhua News Agency mailbox on February 14, 1949, on the question and answer about abolishing the false legal system.)

Can it be said: "The Kuomintang's Six Codes should be critically accepted, but now our level is very low and we have no conditions to criticize, so it is better to simply deny them all for the time being"? Some of our people's judicial cadres, including individual higher-level cadres, have said this. This is also completely wrong. This can only prove that they know nothing about the Marxist-Leninist-Mao Zedong Thought's view of the state and law, completely do not understand the legal policies of the Party and the People's Government, and are relishing and reluctant to part with the laws of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppress the people. Didn't the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on abolishing the Kuomintang's Six Codes and determining the principles of the people's judicial work and the answers to the Xinhua News Agency mailbox on abolishing the false legal system already make a thorough criticism of the reactionary essence of the Kuomintang's Six Codes? In the documents of the Party and the People's Government, has there ever been a single word saying that this extremely reactionary false code is only "temporarily denied in general" rather than completely and permanently abolished? If we are speaking from the standpoint of the people's revolution, then we should say: The reactionary laws of the Kuomintang and the reactionary regime to which they were attached have been crushed by the iron fist of the people's revolution, and there will never be a day for them to return.

"After the October Revolution in Russia, the laws of the Tsar were cited, and didn't the old revolutionary base areas also cite the Kuomintang's Six Codes during the Anti-Japanese War?" This is an argument that the opponents of abolishing the old legal system think is eloquent. Yes, after the October Revolution in Russia, there was indeed a very short period when some old laws of the Tsarist government were cited in the judgments of ordinary civil and criminal cases, but this was only "because those laws had not been abolished by the revolution and did not conflict with the revolutionary conscience and revolutionary legal consciousness" (see Article 5 of the first decree on the court signed by Lenin on November 24, 1917). But after the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) passed a new party program in March 1919, this situation underwent a fundamental change. The party program pointed out: "After abolishing the laws of the overthrown government, the Soviet regime entrusted the judges elected by the Soviets to implement its will by applying the decrees of the proletariat, but in the absence of this decree or the incompleteness of the decree, they should use the socialist legal knowledge." The reason why Russia conditionally based its laws on certain old laws in the first few years after the victory of the revolution was that the Russian proletariat did not establish its own regime before the victory of the revolution, and therefore did not establish its own revolutionary legal system. When it first took over the state power, due to the rebellions of domestic class enemies and the invasion and intervention of international imperialism, and the various practical difficulties caused by this, it was not able to create a new set of laws to completely replace the old laws in time.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working people created their own armed forces and regime very early on, and at the same time began their own legal construction, replacing the counter-revolutionary laws with revolutionary laws. Although the people's laws and judicial system were very simple at first due to the influence of the long-term domestic revolutionary war and the national liberation war, and are still not very complete, the accumulated experience is extremely rich, and it has played an important role in the actual coordination of the revolutionary war and the construction of the democratic regime. Therefore, it was possible for the Chinese people to immediately abolish all the laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government after gaining national power. During the Anti-Japanese War, our revolutionary base areas did individually use certain clauses in the laws of the Kuomintang reactionary government that were beneficial to the people when trying certain cases. Similarly, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, we often used certain clauses in its laws that were beneficial to the masses to protect and strive for the interests of the masses, but these were only temporary tactical actions, "using the enemy's spear to attack the enemy's shield." Doing so was completely correct at the time. It cannot be concluded from this that we basically recognize the Kuomintang's reactionary laws, or that the Kuomintang government's reactionary laws can be basically applied under the New Democratic regime. Comrade Stalin said in his conversation with the British writer Wells: "I am not in favor of any order. I only support the order that is consistent with the interests of the working class. If some laws of the old system can be used to fight for the new order, then this old law should also be used." Here, Stalin is referring to the legal struggle waged by the working class under reactionary rule. When talking about the correct attitude to be taken towards the concessions that the Tsar was forced to make, Comrade Stalin used a wonderful metaphor in "To All Workers": "Needless to say, we will use this concession, we will never refuse the hard-shelled fruit snatched from the crow, and then use the same hard-shelled fruit to smash the crow's head." (Quoted from Arjanov: "Stalin's Complete Works, Volume 1, On State and Law"—China-Soviet Friendship, Volume 2, Issue 8, 1950, page 22) The revolutionary party and revolutionary fighters of the Chinese proletariat correctly applied this strategy when waging a legal struggle against the reactionary ruling class in power. Some people insisted on pulling this situation out as an argument, insisting that the revolutionary people still cite the old laws of the overthrown rulers after they have grasped the state power. If it is not intentionally entangling in order to preserve the false legal system of the Kuomintang, then they have not turned their minds over with the great turn of the Chinese people.

"If the old law is abolished and the new law cannot be produced accordingly, there will be no law to govern and it will cause great chaos in social order." This is alarmist nonsense. Please see: After the Kuomintang's Six Codes were abolished, where has the social order been greatly disrupted? On the contrary, the stability of social order since the founding of the People's Republic of China is unmatched by any period in Chinese history. Although our new revolutionary legal system is still not very complete, there are basically separate regulations on all aspects of social life; or there are already programs, policies, resolutions, and precedents created in judicial practice and recognized by the people to follow. If it is said that our people's judicial work is still a bit "chaotic" now, that is indeed the case. The reason for this is mainly because some people are still using reactionary old laws to "govern" the people's affairs, either openly or secretly, causing dissatisfaction among the people. Precisely because of this, we must thoroughly eliminate all the remaining influence of the reactionary old legal system from our people's judicial organs.

    反人民的旧法律和人民革命政权绝不相容
    陈传纲
    历来剥削阶级的法律，无论古今中外，都是一脉相传地以敌视和镇压被剥削阶级为基础的。为使其剥削制度与阶级特权成为神圣不可侵犯的东西，于是就制造了他们反人民的统治是“合法”的“正统”的等类鬼话，这就是历来剥削阶级的所谓“法统”的秘密。
    阶级社会的各个时代、各个国家的剥削阶级的法律和司法制度，尽管由于剥削形式的变换，因而在表现形式上各有其某些不同的特点，但其基本内容——“富人支配法律，法律压迫穷人”则是绝对一致的。因之，它们之间可以互相抄袭、互相继承。正如恩格斯在“费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结”中所说：英国的资产阶级可以保存旧的封建法制之大部分，而在其中装进资本主义的内容，甚至直接给封建的名称添上资产阶级的意义。在西欧大陆国家，可以同一个罗马法（商品生产者社会头一个全世界的法制）为基础，而仅予以更精确的制订，或者只在审判实践中使之适合于现实的半封建社会
    （如全日耳曼法），或者来一个改头换面，以适应上述的社会状态（如普鲁士的土地法），或者以一个典型的资产阶级社会的“法律全书”出现（如法国拿破仑法典）。同样，旧中国的满清政府可以在维护其封建统治的基础上抄袭日本的刑法，而起草“新刑律”；辛亥革命后，北洋军阀政府可以宣布援用满清的新刑律；国民党反动政府可以抄袭德、日、波、西等国法西斯的法制，并仍旧援引北洋政府的大理院判例，奉为金科玉律。原因无他，就因为它们都是一脉相传地以敌视和镇压被剥削阶级为基础。
    无产阶级领导的人民革命政权能不能抄袭或继承剥削阶级的法律和司法制度呢？绝对不能。斯大林同志在论及无产阶级革命与资产阶级革命的区别时指出：“资产阶级革命只限于用一个剥削者集团代替另一个剥削者集团去执掌政权，所以它无须打破旧国家机器；而无产阶级革命却要把所有一切剥削者集团都从政权高峰上推倒下去，并使全体被剥削劳动群众底领袖，即无产阶级，去执掌政权，所以它必须打破旧国家机器而以新的代替之。”（“列宁主义问题”第一六六页）中国新民主主义的革命是无产阶级社会主义世界革命的一部分，中国人民的革命政权是以无产阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权。虽然在现实的中国新民主主义革命阶段，不是消灭一切的剥削制度，只是消灭帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的剥削制度，并在有利于国计民生的范围内和确保社会主义性质的国营经济的领导权的条件下，允许某种资本主义的剥削，但其最终目的是走向消灭一切剥削制度，走向社会主义和共产主义社会。因之，一切以巩固剥削制度为其历史使命的反人民的旧法统，显然地与以消灭一切剥削制度为其最终目的的人民革命政权是绝不相容的。
    正如新民主主义和社会主义的生产关系，不可能在资本主义社会的母胎里成长一样，人民革命的新法制不可能在地主买办资产阶级的反动法制的基础上成长，而只能在彻底打破了它的囚笼之后成长起来。
    早在一八七一年，马克思就根据巴黎公社的经验指出：工人阶级不能简单地夺取现成的国家机器（即官僚主义的军国主义的机器），并运用它来达到自己的目的，而要把它彻底打碎。（法兰西内战第一○三——一○四页）列宁在一九○五年所制定的临时革命政府纲领中就明确指出了：必须立刻废除一切反革命反人民的旧法律。（列宁选集第六卷第四一页）毛主席在一九四九年一月十四日关于时局的声明中提出，废除国民党伪法统，作为八项和平条件之一，中共中央在同年二月发出“关于废除国民党的六法全书与确定人民的司法工作原则的指示”，中国人民革命大宪章——共同纲领第十七条明确规定：“废除国民党反动政府一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度，制定保护人民的法律、法令，建立人民司法制度。”是完全符合于中国人民革命的要求，符合于马克思列宁主义的革命理论的。
    人民革命政权能不能承认反人民反革命的政权及其法律呢？绝对不能。列宁说，无产阶级领导的人民革命政权“就是革命的专政，即直接凭靠革命的夺取手段，凭靠民众自下直接倡首的政权，而不是凭靠集中的国家政权（按：指沙皇专制的国家政权）所颁布的法律的政权”。（论两个政权并存的局面——
    “列宁文选”第二卷第二三页）所以，它“不承认任何其他的政权和任何的法律，不承认任何人所定的任何规范。”（“论专政问题底历史”——“列宁选集”第十二卷第二八八页）
    人民革命政权对于资产阶级的旧法院是不是可以用改良的办法，而不必彻底摧毁它呢？绝对不能。列宁在一九一八年一月的人民委员会底工作报告中指出：“苏维埃政权在社会主义军队方面所采取过的方针同时也应用到统治阶级底别一种更精巧更复杂的工具——资产阶级的法庭——方面来了。资产阶级的法庭假装维持秩序，而实际上，却是无情镇压被剥削者以保护钱包利益的盲目而精巧的工具。苏维埃政权曾依照历次无产阶级革命底遗训行事，——一下子将旧法庭废除了。让人们叫喊罢，说我们不改良旧法庭，而一下子将它废除了。我们这样就扫清了道路来创造真正的人民法庭”。（“列宁选集”第十三卷第十九页）在同年四月的“苏维埃政权底当前任务”一文中，列宁又指出：“革命群众在一九一七年十月二十五日以后，就走上了正确的道路，并证明出革命底生命力，他们在尚未颁布解散资产阶级官僚司法机关的任何法令以前，就已开始组织自己的，即工农的法庭。”（“列宁文选”第二卷第三九六页）可见，革命的人民法庭与反革命的旧法庭是没有任何血缘的“继承”关系的。我们中国人民的司法机关也正是这样，早在宣布废除国民党伪法统之前就已建立起来，从来就与国民党反动的司法机关不发生任何的联系和瓜葛。
    “马克思主义不是说可以批判地接受旧遗产吗？为什么对于国民党的六法全书就不能批判地接受呢？”是的，马克思主义是说过要批判地接受旧遗产。马克思主义本身就是“人类在十九世纪所造成的那些优秀成果，即德国哲学、英国政治经济学和法国社会主义底当然继承者。”（列宁：“马克思主义底三个来源与三个组成部分”——论马克思、恩格斯及马克思主义第六四—六五页）。但，是不是任何的旧遗产都要“批判地接受”呢？绝对不是的。列宁在一八九七年写的“我们究竟拒绝什么遗产？”一文中指出：马克思主义者所要批判地接受的遗产，只是“一般启蒙者底遗产，是对改革前的一切东西采取绝对敌视态度的人们底遗产，是拥护西欧理想和广大群众利益的人们底遗产”。（原书第五一、五二页）而不是民粹派的遗产——即封建制度残余中的若干残余。国民党的六法全书是不是我们所应该批判地接受的“遗产”呢？绝对不是的。国民党的六法全书，是集中外古今封建买办法西斯的反人民反革命的法律之大成的法典。如果中国人民不愿意拿敌人的刀来砍自己的头，不愿意把已经打掉了的旧枷锁重新拾起来套在自己的脖子上，那就应该毫无保留地全部废除它。
    和国民党反动集团所继承的实质上是曾国藩、袁世凯等封建买办阶级对外出卖祖国、对内残害人民的反革命的传统相反，中国人民在中国共产党领导下所继承和发扬光大的传统，则是自太平天国以至于第一次国内革命战争时期的不完全的革命传统，以及在中国人民建立了自己的革命政权之后用完全新式的革命斗争逐渐建立起来的完全革命的新传统，也就是革命的法统。（见一九四九年二月十四日新华社信箱关于废除伪法统的问答。）
    能不能这样说：“国民党的六法应该批判的接受，但现在我们水平很低，没有条件批判，所以还是暂时一概否定为好”呢？在我们的人民司法干部中，包括个别较高级的干部在内，是有人这样说的。这也是完全错误的。这只能证明他们对于马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的国家观与法律观毫无所知，对于党和人民政府的法律政策全然不理解，而对于国民党反动政府压迫人民的法律则津津有味，恋恋不舍。中共中央关于废除国民党的六法全书与确定人民的司法工作原则的指示和新华社信箱关于废除伪法统的解答，对于国民党六法全书的反动本质不是早已作了透辟的批判吗？在党和人民政府的文件中何尝有片言只句说过对于这个反动透顶的伪法典只是“暂时一概否定”，而不是彻底地、永远地全部废除呢？如果是站在人民革命的立场上说话，那就应当说：国民党的反动法律与其所依附的反动政权既已被人民革命的铁拳所粉碎，即永无复返之日。
    “俄国十月革命后曾援用过沙皇的法律，革命老根据地在抗日时期不也援用过国民党的六法全书吗？”这是反对废除旧法统论者的一个自以为振振有辞的论据。是的，俄国十月革命后，诚然有过一个很短暂的时期，在普通民刑案件的判决中曾援用过某些沙皇政府的旧法律，但这只是“因为那些法律未被革命所废除而且与革命良心和革命法律意识不相抵触的”（见一九一七年十一月二十四日列宁签署的第一号关于法院的法令第五条）。但在一九一九年三月俄国共产党（布）第八次代表大会通过了新的党纲之后，这种情况就发生了根本性的改变。党纲中指出：“在废止被推翻的政府的法律之后，苏维埃政权委托了经苏维埃选出的审判员适用无产阶级的法令而实行它的意志，但在没有这项法令或法令不完备的场合，就要运用社会主义的法律认识。”其所以俄国革命胜利后在最初数年内有条件地依据某些旧法律，那是由于俄国无产阶级在革命胜利前没有建立起自己的政权，因而也没有建立起自己的革命法制，而在初掌国家政权时，由于国内阶级敌人的叛乱和国际帝国主义的侵入干涉，以及由此而引起的各种实际困难，还来不及制出一套新的法律来完全代替旧的法律。
    在中国共产党的领导下的中国劳动人民，很早就创造了自己的武装和政权，并同时开始了自己的法律建设，用革命的法律代替了反革命的法律。虽然由于长时期的国内革命战争和民族解放战争的影响，人民的法律和司法制度最初是很简陋的，至今也还不十分完备，但积累的经验却是极丰富的，并且在实际配合革命战争和民主政权的建设中起了重要的作用。因此，中国人民就有可能在取得全国政权之后立即全部废除国民党反动政府的法律、法令和司法制度。在抗日战争时期，我们的革命根据地在审判某种案件时，确曾个别地利用过国民党反动政府的法律中某些有利于人民的条款。同样，在国民党反动政权的统治下，我们也常常利用它的法律中某些有利于群众的条款，来保护与争取群众的利益，但这都只是一时的策略上的行动，是“以子之矛而攻子之盾”。这样做在当时是完全正确的。决不能因此而得出结论说我们在基本上承认国民党的反动法律，或者说在新民主主义政权下能够在基本上适用国民党政府的反动法律。斯大林同志在与英国作家威尔斯的谈话中说：“我不是拥护任何的秩序。我只拥护与工人阶级利益一致的秩序。如果旧制度底某些法律可以利用来争取新秩序，那也就应当利用这个旧法律。”这里，斯大林是指工人阶级在反动统治下进行合法斗争时说的。谈到对待沙皇被迫让步所应采取的正当态度时，斯大林同志在“告全体工人书”中曾用了一个绝妙的比喻：“用不着说，我们对于这个让步是会加以利用的，我们决不会谢绝从乌鸦那里夺来的硬壳果，然后又用这同一个硬壳果去砸碎乌鸦的头。”（引自阿尔然诺夫：“斯大林全集第一卷论国家与法律”—一九五○年中苏友好二卷八期第二二页）中国无产阶级的革命政党和革命战士们在向当权的反动统治阶级作合法斗争时，就是正确地运用了这个策略。有些人硬把这种情况拉出来作为一种论据，硬要革命的人民在掌握了国家政权之后仍然援用已被推翻的统治者的旧法律，如果不是有意地为保存国民党的伪法统而缠讼不清，就是没有把自己的脑筋随着中国人民的大翻身而翻过来。
    “废除了旧法，新法不能相应地产生，就会无法可司，引起社会秩序大乱。”这是一种危言耸听的胡说。请看：废除了国民党的六法全书之后，社会秩序何尝大乱？相反，中华人民共和国成立以来社会秩序的安定，是中国历史上任何时期所望尘莫及的。虽然我们的革命新法制至今还不十分完备，但有关社会生活各方面的单行法规，大体上都已有了；或者已有纲领、政策、决议以及在审判实践中创造出来并为人民所确认的成例可循。如果说我们的人民司法工作现在还有些“乱”，那倒是事实。其所以如此，主要是由于有些人还在或明或暗地沿用反动的旧法来“司”人民的事，以致引起人民群众的不满。正因为这样，我们才必须把一切反动的旧法统的残余影响从我们人民司法机关中彻底地清除出去。
