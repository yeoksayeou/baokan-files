    Northeast State-Owned Mechanical and Electrical Systems are Universally Preparing to Promote "Organizing Rhythmic Production According to Indicated Charts"
    The Mechanical and Electrical Systems of the Northeast Industrial Department are systematically and purposefully promoting the advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to indicated charts." Currently, factories under the Mechanical and Electrical Industrial Bureaus are universally preparing to promote this advanced experience. According to the preliminary plans of each factory, pilot projects in key workshops will be completed in the third quarter of this year, and this advanced experience will be universally promoted to other workshops in the fourth quarter.
    To do a good job of promotion, both the Northeast Mechanical and Electrical Industrial Bureaus have held short-term training classes, selecting more than 260 management cadres from affiliated factories for study, cultivating the backbone of promotion work. At the same time, specialized organizations for promotion work have been established within the bureaus and in each factory, and promotion plans have been formulated. In addition to requiring each factory to report on the progress of promotion work to the bureau every ten days, the Northeast Mechanical Industrial Bureau has also sent many cadres to factories to conduct key inspections and assist in pilot work.
    The main problems encountered by various factories in the initial implementation of "organizing rhythmic production according to indicated charts" in key workshops are: some management cadres lack a correct understanding of this advanced experience, such as some believing that the production tasks are complex, equipment and production are unbalanced, and they do not yet have the conditions for promotion; some believe that learning this experience can solve all problems, and do not actively promote other advanced experiences; others believe that there were already some charts in the past, and adding some more will suffice, ignoring the organizational work that should be done; cadres below the workshop level also generally have erroneous ideas such as fearing trouble. Therefore, each factory has vigorously organized management cadres, technicians, and staff to study the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department's instructions on promoting "organizing rhythmic production according to indicated charts" and the Northeast Third Machine Factory's experience in implementing this method, and other documents. According to statistics from fourteen factories under the Northeast Mechanical Industrial Bureau, more than 800 people have participated in the study. Under the leadership of the factory director, the Northeast Fifth Machine Factory has held five training classes for section chiefs and workshop directors, statisticians, planners, material clerks, and foremen in the past month. Through study, various erroneous ideas among the cadres have been corrected. Combining study, each factory has thoroughly exposed the shortcomings in production management, and at the same time adopted the method of learning while doing to launch promotion work. In general, in the work of promoting "organizing rhythmic production according to indicated charts" in key workshops, many factories start with formulating work plans and adjusting labor organization. The steps for formulating a work plan are: first, conduct a detailed investigation and research on the actual production capacity of equipment and labor, product operation hours, raw material consumption, production cycle, etc., and then formulate a work plan based on the accurate data collected. Production instruction charts are then formulated based on the work plan. Because adjusting labor organization and implementing division of labor specialization is an important step in improving labor efficiency and implementing rhythmic production, the Northeast Electrical Industrial Bureau instructed its affiliated factories to first universally promote the method of "labor division of labor specialization" in pilot workshops when promoting the advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to indicated charts." The Northeast Second and Fifth Machine Factories have also promoted the labor organization form of "same-type specialization of labor" in pilot workshops.
    In order to prepare an appropriate amount of raw materials and semi-finished product reserves for the implementation of rhythmic production, various factories have now begun to take stock of warehouses and workshop parts, paying attention to improving the supply of raw materials.

### 东北国营机械、电器系统正普遍进行推广“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的准备工作

    东北国营机械、电器系统正普遍进行推广“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的准备工作
    东北工业部机械、电器两系统正有领导有步骤地推广“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验。目前机械、电器两工业管理局所属各工厂，正普遍进行推广这一先进经验的准备工作。按照各工厂的初步计划，在今年第三季度内，将完成重点车间的试点工作，在第四季度内将这一先进经验普遍推广到其它车间。
    为做好推广工作，东北机械、电器两工业管理局都举办了短期训练班，抽调所属各厂管理干部二百六十多人进行学习，培养了推广工作的骨干。同时，局内和各厂都成立了专门做推广工作的组织机构，制订了推广计划。东北机械工业管理局除规定所属各工厂每隔十天向局做一次推广工作情况的报告外，还派出了许多干部到各厂做重点检查和帮助试点的工作。
    各工厂在重点车间初步推行“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”中所遇到的主要问题是：有些管理干部对这一先进经验缺乏正确的认识，如有的认为生产任务复杂，设备和生产不平衡，还没具备推广条件；有的认为学习了这个经验就可以解决一切问题，而不积极推广其他的先进经验；也有的认为过去已有了一些图表，再补充些就行了，忽视了应做的组织工作；车间以下干部还普遍存在着怕麻烦等等错误思想。因此，各厂都大力组织管理干部、技术人员、职员学习了东北人民政府工业部关于推行“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的指示和东北第三机器厂实行这一方法的经验等文件。据东北机械工业管理局十四个工厂统计：目前参加学习的已有八百多人。东北第五机器厂在厂长领导下，一个月来已举办了科长和车间主任、统计员、计划员、材料员、工长等五个训练班。经过学习，干部中的各种错误思想得到了纠正。各厂结合学习，都深入揭发了生产管理上的缺点，同时采取边学边做的方法展开了推广工作。许多工厂在重点车间推行“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的工作中，一般都是从制订作业计划和调整劳动组织着手的。制订作业计划的步骤是：首先对设备和劳动力的实际生产能力、产品操作工时、原材料消耗、生产周期等进行细致的调查研究，而后根据收集到的精确资料，制订作业计划。生产指示图表则依据作业计划制订。由于调整劳动组织，实行分工专业，是提高劳动效率，实行有节奏生产的一个重要步骤，东北电器工业管理局在推行“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验时，指示所属各工厂首先在试点车间内普遍推行“劳动分工专业化”的方法。东北第二、第五机器厂也都在试点车间中推行了“同类型专业化分工”的劳动组织形式。
    为了给实行有节奏生产时准备适当的原材料、半成品的储备量，目前各工厂都已开始清点仓库和车间零件，注意改进原材料的供应工作。（新华社）
