    Riveters Can Also Implement Assembly Line Methods
    To the Editor: The Yang Chongshan riveting team of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Assembly Department previously had a poor labor organization, often facing a situation of many tasks and few people. When repair tasks were urgent, skilled workers would rush to complete them, while unskilled workers would be in a flurry. Seeing this situation, Yang Chongshan came up with a plan to implement assembly line methods and convened a team meeting to discuss how to specifically divide the work and overcome the difficulty of having few people and many tasks.
    After discussion, it was decided to divide the work according to technical ability and project type. For example, Li Zhi was fast, bright, and soft at heating rivets, so he was assigned to heat rivets; Gao Ming was experienced in riveting, so he specialized in riveting; Bai Zhongshan specialized in drilling holes, and so on. At the same time, everyone brainstormed to find tricks to improve operating methods. Bai Zhongshan, Guo Yinlai, and Yang Chongshan transformed the twist drill bit, grinding the two oblique angles of the twist drill into flat surfaces and grinding the long, pointed tip into a rounded point, increasing work efficiency by fifty times. In the past, one sharpening of the drill bit could only drill twenty or thirty holes, but now one sharpening of the drill bit can drill more than a thousand holes. After the Yang Chongshan team implemented assembly line methods, the work of fifty people could be done by ten people. Also, because everyone in this team has发挥了积极性(given full play to their initiative) and tried to save as much as possible, they no longer use oxygen to 通眼(open the holes) when joining pieces, saving eighty bottles of oxygen in July. These two items alone can save the country wealth worth more than 300,000 jin of millet per year, and eliminate the phenomenon of rework due to unstable rivets.    Tai Steel

    铆工也可以实行流水作业法
    编辑同志：太原钢铁厂装配部杨崇山铆工小组，从前劳动组织不好，常常是活多人少。在修配任务紧急时，有技术的工人便赶任务，没技术的工人就忙成一团。杨崇山看到这种情况，想出实行流水作业法的计划，并召开小组会和大家商量，研究怎样进行具体分工，克服人少活多的困难。
    经过商量，决定按技术能力和工程种类进行了分工。比如李志烧钉又快、又亮、又软，就分配他烧钉；高明铆钉有经验就专铆钉；白忠山专门打眼等。同时，大家动脑筋找窍门改进操作方法。白忠山，郭银来，杨崇山改造了麻花钻头，把麻花钻两个斜角磨成平面，钻的长形尖头磨成圆尖，工作效率提高了五十倍，过去磨一次钻头只能打二、三十个眼，现在磨一次钻头打一千多眼。杨崇山小组实行流水作业法后，五十人的活十人就可以做了。又由于这个小组的每个人都发挥了积极性，尽量节约，现在对合已经不用氧气通眼，七月份节省八十瓶氧气。以上两项，一年即可为国家节省价值三十余万斤小米的财富，并且消灭了因铆钉不稳而返工的现象。    太钢
