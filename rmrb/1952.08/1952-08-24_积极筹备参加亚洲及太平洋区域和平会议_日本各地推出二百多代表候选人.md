Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: Tokyo News: The Japanese people are actively preparing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. People from all walks of life throughout Japan are enthusiastically engaged in a movement to elect representatives to attend the Peace Conference. The Japanese Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has received lists of candidate representatives nominated by peace advocates in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kanagawa, Ibaraki, Hyogo and other places, the Japan Student Anti-War Organization, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan National Relief Association, and democratic organizations of youth and women. The candidates include Yoshitaro Hirano, Director of the China Research Institute and Vice-Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, and Tatsuji Fuse, Chairman of the Japan National Relief Association. The All-Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union and the Government Offices Labor Union Council in Tokyo have also decided on their union representatives. The Japanese Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is scheduled to convene a national representative conference in late August, where it will be decided who will be selected from each prefecture, group, and labor union to attend the Peace Conference in Beijing.

People from all walks of life in Japan have expressed their support for the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. About forty Japanese cultural figures, including Michio Iwamura, Masamoto Ozawa, Yoichi Fukushima, and Kansuke Seki, recently wrote to Chinese cultural figures, saying: "No matter what obstacles there may be, we will send representatives of Japanese cultural figures to Beijing to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference." The Japan-China Friendship Association expressed its enthusiastic support for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in a letter to the Chinese people and decided to send representatives to attend. Workers in Bibai Higashi-Horonai have expressed their desire to send representatives to participate in the conference, and they have already launched a signature campaign to participate. Prince Mikasa, the younger brother of the Japanese Emperor Hirohito, also expressed his support for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and agreed that Japanese representatives should participate in the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: The Japanese people are welcoming the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference with great enthusiasm. More than two hundred representative candidates have been nominated from all over the country. The Japanese Preparatory Committee recently sent a telegram to Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, stating: "The Japan National Peace Conference will select one hundred representatives to attend the Peace Conference in Beijing, and hopes that the conference will accept all candidates beyond the one hundred representatives with the qualifications of observers to participate in the conference." Liu Ningyi has replied to the Japanese Preparatory Committee, welcoming the enthusiastic support of the Japanese people for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Because the proportion of official representatives from various countries attending the conference has been determined and agreed upon by all countries, Japan is allowed to send forty official representatives, and peace advocates other than official representatives are welcome to come to Beijing to attend the conference as observers.
