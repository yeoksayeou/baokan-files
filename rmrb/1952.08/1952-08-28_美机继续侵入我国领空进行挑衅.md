Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 27th: While the US invading air force in Korea wantonly destroys peaceful Korean cities, it has continued to invade our Northeast airspace over the past month, and the scope of its activities has been expanding. From July 25th to August 25th, US planes in 172 batches totaling 822 sorties have successively intruded into the airspace over Andong City and Benxi, Xinbin, Qingyuan, Xifeng, Ji'an, Tonghua, Andong, Huanren, Fengcheng, Kuandian, Changbai, Zhuanghe in Liaodong Province, and Tumen City and Hunchun County in Jilin Province. During this period, the provocative activities of US planes became increasingly rampant. For example, on August 1st, US planes in 17 batches totaling 84 sorties intruded into the airspace over Andong City and Ji'an, Tonghua, Andong, Zhuanghe, Huanren, Fengcheng, and Kuandian in Liaodong Province for reconnaissance. On August 3rd, US planes in eight batches totaling 42 sorties intruded into the airspace over Tumen City and Hunchun County in Jilin Province for reconnaissance. After August 5th, the scope of US planes invading our airspace became even deeper. For example, on August 5th, four US planes intruded into the airspace over Xinbin, Qingyuan, and Xifeng counties in Liaodong Province for circling reconnaissance. On August 16th, four US planes intruded into the airspace over Lianshanguan, south of Benxi City in Liaodong Province. In addition to reconnaissance and other activities, the invading US planes also carried out bombing and strafing. For example, on August 7th, one US plane dropped four bombs over Liangmindi District in Ji'an County, Liaodong Province, and strafed, killing and wounding two of our residents, while another four strafed over Dadonggou in Andong County, Liaodong Province.
