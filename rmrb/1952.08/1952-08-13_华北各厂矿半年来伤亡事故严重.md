Serious Casualty Accidents in North China Factories and Mines in the Past Six Months

In the past six months, serious casualty accidents have continuously occurred in factories and mines in North China, and have become a serious obstacle to the current patriotic production increase and thrift campaign.

According to incomplete statistics from Beijing, Chahar, Tianjin, Shanxi and other places, a total of 2,892 accidents of various sizes occurred in factories and mines in the first half of the year, causing serious casualties and huge losses to production. According to statistics from 351 accidents of various sizes in only eight units, the loss value reached more than 1.62 million catties of millet. In the first quarter, 88 accidents occurred in Yangquan Coal Mine, and the loss value due to work-related injuries resulting in missed work and machine failures affecting production reached 1.3 billion yuan.

The reasons for such serious accidents are:

    I. Some factories and mines have not yet changed their capitalist methods of factory management, one-sidedly emphasizing increased output and ignoring worker safety. For example, in order to not miss the contract deadline, the Majiagou Brick Factory in Kailuan required workers to take bricks out of hot caves above 200 degrees Celsius, resulting in injuries to many workers. Beijing Transportation Company undertook business from the Coal Construction Company. Due to insufficient safety equipment, four workers died in one month, and there were more serious and minor injuries. The company not only failed to conduct serious investigations and handle such serious accidents, but also tried to shirk responsibility.

    II. Bureaucratism of leading cadres. Some leading cadres of enterprises neither actively improve safety equipment, strengthen protection, nor adopt correct suggestions from workers. In the East Inclined Shaft of the Second Mine of Fengfeng Coal Mine, the leading cadres did not separate the transportation roadway from the pedestrian walkway according to the safety regulations in advance, nor did they provide necessary safety equipment such as canopies, rope breaks, and safety holes. Workers had repeatedly made suggestions, but they did not receive attention from the leadership. This resulted in a runaway car accident, injuring and killing eight workers. In Tianjin, accidents caused by poor equipment accounted for 20 percent of all accidents. In the 297 accidents that occurred in Tangshan Railway Factory, 35 percent were due to a lack of protective equipment.

    III. Factories and mines do not provide enough technical safety education for workers, resulting in some workers' loose labor discipline, carelessness at work, and failure to work according to operating procedures, which is also one of the causes of accidents. For example, in Xuanhua City, three units caused accidents in which two workers were seriously injured and many people were slightly injured because workers did not understand operating procedures or violated labor discipline.

    IV. Some factories and mines have unsound safety institutions, and the labor protection committees of some trade unions are only for show. Problems found in safety inspections have not been resolved in a timely manner. For example, in Tangshan City, a safety re-inspection was conducted in seventeen units in June. It was found that 568 problems raised in the safety inspection in the autumn of last year have not yet been resolved. The safety inspection work in Chahar Province is also only for show.

    V. Accidents such as high temperature, dust, and harmful gas poisoning in the iron and steel, chemical and other industrial sectors have not been completely overcome so far. The excessively long working hours (up to 16 hours) of workers in some factories and mines, insufficient dormitories, and poor sanitary conditions all seriously affect the health of workers. According to statistics from twelve units in Tangshan City, the number of people taking sick leave from January to May reached 19,672, and the number of sick leave days reached 180,554 days. These phenomena will undoubtedly seriously hinder production.

In order to smoothly carry out the patriotic production increase and thrift campaign, and ensure the completion and surpassing of the production increase and thrift tasks, it is necessary to strengthen factory and mine safety work, eliminate serious injury and death accidents, reduce minor injury accidents, and remove obstacles in the campaign. All factories and mines must further implement the policy of "developing production and protecting labor," clearly establish the concept of safe production, thoroughly eliminate certain capitalist methods of factory management, and overcome bureaucratic work styles. Leading cadres of factories and mines must specifically grasp safety conditions, strengthen protection, and proactively prevent accidents. Those who disregard policies and laws and disregard human lives should be given serious and conscientious treatment. At the same time, all factories and mines must improve safety and health equipment and protective equipment, improve administrative safety institutions and labor protection organizations led by trade unions, strictly implement the safety inspection system, and strengthen technical safety education so that every worker understands technical safety operating procedures. Trade unions should do a good job in labor protection work. In addition to regularly caring about workers' safety and health conditions and educating employees, they should cultivate models of safe production, summarize and promote advanced experience in safe production, so as to achieve the goal of safe production.

### 华北各厂矿半年来伤亡事故严重

    华北各厂矿半年来伤亡事故严重
    华北各地厂矿，最近半年来连续发生严重的伤亡事故，并已成为当前爱国增产节约竞赛运动的严重障碍。
    据北京、察哈尔、天津、山西等地不完全的统计，各厂矿上半年共发生大小事故二千八百九十二次，造成严重伤亡，也使生产遭到巨大损失。仅据八个单位发生的三百五十一次大小事故的统计，其损失价值达小米一百六十二万余斤。阳泉煤矿第一季发生的事故八十八次，因工伤而误工和机器发生故障而影响生产的损失价值达十三亿元。
    造成如此严重事故的原因是：
    一、部分厂矿仍未改变资本主义管理工厂的方法，片面强调增加产量，忽视工人安全。如开滦马家沟砖厂，为了不误合同限期，要工人在摄氏二百度以上的热窟中把砖取出来，以致很多工人受伤。北京运输公司，承揽煤建公司业务，由于安全设备不够，一个月中死亡工人四名，重伤轻伤更多。该公司对如此严重事故，不但不作认真检查处理，反而设法推诿责任。
    二、领导干部的官僚主义。有些企业的领导干部，既不主动改善安全设备，加强防护，又不采纳工人的正确建议。峰峰煤矿第二矿东斜井，领导干部事先没根据保安规程把运输巷道与人行道分开，也不作罐档、断绳及保险洞等必要的安全设备。工人曾多次提出建议，但都没有引起领导方面的重视。致造成跑车事故，伤亡工人八名。天津市发生的事故中，因设备不良而造成事故的占百分之二十。唐山铁路工厂发生的二百九十七次事故中，百分之三十五属于缺乏防护设备。
    三、各厂矿对工人的技术安全教育很不够，因而造成部分工人的劳动纪律松懈，在工作中麻痹大意，不按操作规程工作，亦是造成事故的原因之一。如宣化市有三个单位，因工人不懂操作规程或违犯劳动纪律而造成重伤工人二名、轻伤很多人的事故。
    四、部分厂矿的保安机构不健全，有的工会劳动保护委员会流于形式，在保安检查中发现的问题没得到及时的解决。如唐山市六月份在十七个单位中进行保安复查，发现去年秋季保安检查中提出的五百六十八个问题，现在仍未解决；察哈尔省的保安检查工作，也流于形式。
    五、钢铁、化学等产业部门的高温、尘末及有害气体中毒等事故，到现在还没有彻底克服。部分厂矿工人的劳动时间过长（达十六小时），宿舍不够，卫生条件恶劣，都严重地影响工人身体健康。根据唐山市十二个单位统计，一至五月份请病假的人数达一万九千六百七十二人，病假日达十八万零五百五十四日。这些现象，无疑问的都会严重地妨碍生产。
    为了顺利地开展爱国增产节约竞赛运动，保证完成与超过增产节约任务，必须加强厂矿保安工作，消灭重伤和死亡事故，减少轻伤事故，扫除运动中的障碍。各厂矿必须进一步贯彻“发展生产，保护劳动”的方针，明确树立安全生产的思想，彻底肃清管理工厂的某些资本主义方法，克服官僚主义作风。厂矿领导干部必须具体掌握安全情况，加强防护，主动防止事故。对毫不顾政策法令、玩忽人命的人，应该给予严肃的认真的处理。同时，各厂矿必须改善安全卫生设备和防护用具，健全行政保安机构和工会领导的劳动保护组织，严格保安检查制度，加强技术安全教育，使每个工人都懂得技术安全操作规程。工会要把劳动保护工作做好，除经常关心工人的安全健康条件和对职工进行教育外，应培养安全生产模范旗帜，总结和推广安全生产的先进经验，以达到安全生产的目的。
