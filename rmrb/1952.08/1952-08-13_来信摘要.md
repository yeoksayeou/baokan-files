Letter Excerpts

    The Fuyang Branch of the China National Food Corporation Should Immediately Strengthen Grain Storage Management
    The Fuyang Branch of the China National Food Corporation is careless about grain storage management, resulting in a significant problem of grain infestation. The company has only one directly managed warehouse, and the grain reserves are not large. More than a dozen storage and laboratory personnel are often idle and do nothing. Weeds grow profusely around the warehouse and the storage yard, and there is a lot of spilled grain on the warehouse floor. Some soybeans have sprouted, but no one cares. The grain stored at the Fengtai Office, which is under the jurisdiction of the company, was infested with insects and was mixed into good grain and transported to other areas.
    The company's bureaucratic style has caused great losses to state property. It is recommended that the relevant leading authorities inspect the company's work and urge them to correct this irresponsible style. Wang Shuli
    Editor's Note: Late summer and early autumn are the critical times for grain storage management. The China National Food Corporation and the East China District Food Corporation have repeatedly instructed all regions to pay attention to grain protection and strictly prohibit the transfer of insect-infested or damaged grain to other regions. The Fuyang Grain Branch Company has ignored the instructions of its superiors, causing undue losses to state property. This serious bureaucratic style is intolerable. It is hoped that the relevant leading departments will accept the reader's suggestion and promptly investigate and deal with this matter.
    Agencies in the Southern Jiangsu District Should Not Suspend Daily Operations to Focus Solely on Sanitation Work
    Some agencies in the Southern Jiangsu District have temporarily suspended their daily work in order to carry out the sanitation campaign. Agencies at the Wuxi city level suspended work for five days, and agencies at the Southern Jiangsu district level suspended work for three days. I inquired about the truth of the matter from a leading agency in the Southern Jiangsu District, and it was said that the entire Southern Jiangsu District was preparing to do so.
    I think this approach is wrong. Workers and peasants can do a good job of sanitation amidst tense production. Why do office workers, who work eight hours a day, have to suspend their daily work to focus on sanitation work? I suggest that the leading authorities in the Southern Jiangsu District reconsider this issue.

    Suggestion to Strengthen Forest Protection Work in Shaanxi Province
    Some areas in Shaanxi Province do not pay enough attention to forest protection work. Taking Ningqiang County as an example: In just one month, there were seventy-seven incidents of mountain fires, burning more than 390 li of mountain ridges. After the mountain fires occurred, the county's leading authorities neither mobilized the masses to rescue the forests nor reported to the higher authorities, allowing the fires to "burn themselves out." The county's Public Security Bureau not only failed to implement the forest protection policies, but frequently led prisoners to cut down trees. According to incomplete statistics from this spring, there were a total of one hundred and twenty-seven forest fire incidents in the province, burning down more than 80,000 mu of forest, causing serious losses to the state's forest resources. It is recommended that the relevant leading authorities in Shaanxi Province pay attention to this issue and quickly strengthen forest protection work.

    Hazardous Goods Should Be Clearly Marked on Packaging
    In order to avoid incidents of workers being poisoned or injured by explosions when transporting toxic or explosive goods, I suggest that production units and trade departments should use paint to mark the name of the goods and precautions for loading and unloading on the packaging of boxed or barreled hazardous goods, such as "Toxic," "Explosive," "Waterproof," "Handle with Care," etc., to attract the attention of the porters. Trade unions in various places should strengthen technical operation and discipline education for workers, and organize workers to learn about preventive knowledge when handling dangerous goods. Zhang Lei Xiong
    Goods Should Be Well Packaged to Avoid Damage During Transportation
    We are staff members of the Tianjin Allocation Team of the Qingdao Branch of the China Industrial Equipment Company. In our work, we have found that some industrial raw materials shipped from the Northeast District Company of the China Industrial Equipment Company are not packaged firmly, causing great losses to state property. A batch of "Fuqiang" brand dinitrochlorobenzene (toxic) leaked a lot due to the poor quality of the iron drums, causing a poisoning incident among the porters. Another batch of bottled sulfuric acid had half of the bottles broken upon arrival because the wooden boxes were not nailed firmly and there was too little padding inside.
    Production units should pay attention to the packaging of products, and transportation departments should also inspect the packaging when dispatching goods to avoid unnecessary losses during transportation. Ding Dake Li Changqing
    The Purchasing Group of the Engineering Section of the Transportation Department of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office Should Not Waste Timber
    I am an intern in the Engineering Section of the Transportation Department of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office, and I was recently assigned to Shanghai to participate in the work of the purchasing group. We are relatively strict with the specifications and quality requirements for timber, so we have not purchased enough of the planned amount. However, the construction date is approaching. The comrade in charge of the purchasing group decided to cut long timber into shorter lengths to make up for the shortage of short materials. I believe that this approach violates the State Council's instructions on saving timber, and I raised my concerns at the time. The comrade in charge of the purchasing group said, "Policies should be applied flexibly according to the actual situation," and did not accept my opinion. We hope you can tell us whether our purchasing group's approach is correct.
    Zhang Runhai
    Editor's Note: The State Council's instructions on saving timber clearly stipulate the prohibition of using large materials for small purposes, using long materials for short purposes, and using high-quality materials for low-quality purposes. The comrade in charge of the purchasing group of the Engineering Section of the Transportation Department of Southern Jiangsu, using "Central policies should be applied flexibly according to the specific situation" as an excuse, openly violated the State Council's instructions, which is obviously wrong. This erroneous approach should be corrected immediately.

    来信摘要
    中国粮食公司阜阳支公司应立即加强粮食保管工作
    中国粮食公司阜阳支公司对粮食保管工作漫不经心，以致粮食生虫现象相当严重。该公司只有一个直属仓库，存粮并不多。十几个保管化验人员，经常闲着不作事。仓库和货场周围野草丛生，库内地脚粮（泼撒的粮食）非常多。有些黄豆生了芽，但都无人过问。该公司所属凤台办事处的存粮生了虫，竟掺在好粮食里运给其他地区。
    该公司的官僚主义作风，已使国家财产受到很大损失。建议有关领导机关检查该公司的工作，督促他们纠正这种不负责任的作风。王书李
    编者按：夏末秋初，正是保管粮食的紧张时节。中国粮食公司及华东区粮食公司曾一再指示各地注意护粮工作，并严禁把虫粮坏粮调到其他地区。阜阳粮食支公司竟对上级指示置若罔闻，使国家财产受到不应有的损失。这种严重的官僚主义作风是令人不能容忍的。希望有关领导部门接受读者建议，迅速对此事进行检查处理。
    苏南区各机关不应停止日常业务单搞卫生工作
    苏南区有些机关为了开展卫生运动，竟暂时停止了日常工作。无锡市一级的机关停止工作五天，苏南区一级的机关停止工作三天。我曾向苏南区某领导机关询问事情真象，据说全苏南区都准备这样做。
    我认为这种做法是错误的。工人、农民能够在紧张的生产中搞好卫生工作，每天工作八小时的机关工作人员，为什么必须停止日常工作来搞卫生工作呢？我建议苏南区领导机关重新考虑这个问题。

    建议陕西省加强护林工作
    陕西省某些地区很不重视护林工作。以宁强县来说：在短短一个月内，就发生烧山事件七十七起，延烧山岭三百九十多里。山火发生后，该县领导机关既不发动群众抢救，又不向上级报告，听其“自燃自灭”。该县公安局不但不执行护林政策，反而经常率领犯人砍伐林木。全省森林失火事件，据今年春天的不完全统计，共发生一百二十七次，烧毁森林八万多亩，使国家森林资源遭到严重的损失。建议陕西省有关领导机关重视这个问题，迅速加强护林工作。

    有危险性的货物应在包装物上写明白
    为了避免运输有毒的或有爆炸性的货物时，发生工人中毒或被炸伤的事件，我建议各生产单位及贸易部门在发出箱装或桶装的有危险性的货物时，在包装物上用油漆标注品名及装卸时应注意事项，如“有毒”、“爆炸”、“防水”、“轻放”等，以便引起搬运工人的注意。各地搬运工会应对工人加强技术操作及纪律教育，组织工人学习搬运危险品时的预防常识。张雷雄
    应该把货物包装好免得运输时弄坏了
    我们是中国工业器材公司青岛分公司驻天津调拨组的工作人员。我们在工作中发现中国工业器材公司东北区公司运来的某些工业原料包装得很不牢固，给国家财产造成很大损失。有一批富强牌的二硝基氯化苯（有毒），因铁桶太坏，渗漏很多，并造成搬运工人中毒事件。又有一批瓶装硫酸，因木箱钉得不结实，箱内垫草太少，运到目的地时，已有一半瓶子破碎了。
    生产单位应该重视产品的包装工作，运输部门在发出货物时亦应检查包装工作以免货物在运输途中遭到不应有的损失。丁大可  李长卿
    苏南行署交通处工程科采购组不应浪费木材
    我是苏南行署交通处工程科实习生，在最近被派到上海参加采购组工作。我们对木材的规格和质量要求的比较严格，所以还没有买够计划中的数目。但施工的日期已迫近了。采购组负责同志决定把长材锯短，来填补短料的缺数。我认为这种做法违犯政务院关于节约木材的指示，当时就提出了意见。采购组负责同志说：“政策应该根据实际情况灵活运用”，没有接受我的意见。我们采购组这种做法是否对，希望你们告诉我。
    张润海
    编者按：政务院关于节约木材的指示明确地规定了禁止大材小用、长材短用、优材劣用。苏南交通处工程科采购组负责同志用“中央政策应该根据具体情况灵活运用”做借口，公然违背政务院的指示，显然是错误的。这种错误的作法应该立即纠正。
