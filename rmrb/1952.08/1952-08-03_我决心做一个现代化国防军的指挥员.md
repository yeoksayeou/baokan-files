    I am Determined to Be a Commander of a Modernized National Defense Army
    I have spent ten "August 1st" Army Days in the revolutionary army, but this year I can write my own article to commemorate this great festival. How excited I am! A tree has roots, and water has a source. I deeply feel that without Chairman Mao's leadership, there would be no Zhang Xiaocai today. I remember when I was a teenager, the Kuomintang bandits killed my father. Later, the Communist Party educated me like my father, promoted me from a soldier to a battalion commander step by step, and made me a hero. Now the Party has given me the opportunity to study culture and wants me to be a military commander of a modernized national defense army. How could this not make me feel the happiness and glory of being a Mao Zedong warrior!
    When the entire army launched cultural studies, all the cadres in our battalion formed a class, and I was the class leader. After the study began, I learned the phonetic symbols in only two hours and forty minutes. And led everyone to learn more than two thousand characters in eighteen days, with an average score of ninety-seven. But, just as I was about to further improve my cultural studies in military science and technology, the four pieces of shrapnel in my neck and chest (injured in the battle of Taiyuan in 1948) acted up again, and I had to go to the hospital for surgery.
    In the hospital, when I stroked the scars left by enemy shells, and when I saw several wounded volunteer soldiers around me, it aroused my extremely strong hatred for American imperialism. This hatred increased my determination to overcome difficulties and continue to study culture. I felt that it was not just about my personal study, but that I had a responsibility to help the wounded volunteer soldiers improve their cultural level. So, I automatically organized them and taught them pinyin, literacy, and writing every day. Every time they learned a character, I felt unspeakable joy in my heart. In addition to helping them study every day, I also engaged in self-study. I believe that after I am discharged from the hospital, with a strong body, my cultural studies will quickly catch up with my classmates. I am determined to be a commander of a modernized national defense army, a good soldier of Mao Zedong, and contribute all my strength to building a modernized national defense army and defending the motherland!

### 我决心做一个现代化国防军的指挥员

    我决心做一个现代化国防军的指挥员
    我在革命部队里过了十个“八一”建军节，但今年我能自己写文章来纪念这个伟大的节日，我是多么兴奋啊！树有根，水有源，我深深感到没有毛主席的领导，就没有我张孝才的今天。记得我十几岁时，国民党匪帮杀死了我的父亲，后来共产党就像我父亲一样地教养我，把我由战士一步一步提升为营长，并且成了英雄；现在党又给了我学文化的机会，要我做现代化国防军的军事指挥员。这怎么不使我感到做个毛泽东战士的幸福和光荣呢！
    当全军开展文化学习时，我们全营干部编了一个班，我当班长。学习开始以后，我只用了两小时四十分钟，就把注音符号学会了。并带动大家在十八天里就学会了两千多字，成绩平均为九十七分。但，正当我要进一步提高文化学习军事科学技术时，我脖子和胸部的四块炮弹铁片（一九四八年打太原时负的伤）又在里面作祟了，只得到医院来动手术。
    在医院里，当我抚摸着我这被敌人炮弹炸伤的伤疤，当我看到身边几位志愿军的伤员时，更引起我对美帝国主义无比强烈的仇恨，这仇恨增加了我克服困难，继续学文化的毅力。我觉得不光我个人学习，我自己有责任帮助志愿军伤员们提高文化，于是，就自动把他们组织起来，每天教他们拼音、认字、写字。每当他们学会一个字，我心里就感到说不出的高兴。我每天除帮助他们学习以外，就进行自修。我相信，在我出院后，有了强健的身体，文化学习很快就会赶上班上的同志。我决心做个现代化国防军的指挥员，当个毛泽东的好战士，为建设现代化国防军，保卫祖国而贡献自己所有的力量！
