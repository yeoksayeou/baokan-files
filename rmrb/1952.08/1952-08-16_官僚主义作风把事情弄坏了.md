Bureaucratic Work Style Ruins Things
Zhang Tan, Manager of the Northeast Industrial Department Construction Engineering Company

    The Northeast Construction Engineering Company has achieved great results in promoting Su Changyou's advanced bricklaying experience, Xie Wanfu's woodworking assembly line advanced experience, and Yang Dezhong's plastering advanced experience in the construction sites under its jurisdiction in the Harbin area. Almost 100% of the carpenters have learned Xie Wanfu's assembly line method, and more than 80% of the bricklayers have implemented the double-handed mortar squeezing continuous bricklaying method (of course, the degree of proficiency varies). However, there were detours in the promotion of these advanced experiences.

    Last winter and spring, the company held training classes for construction workers and team leaders, invited people from various advanced groups to give reports, and organized on-site demonstrations. Each engineering office also held worker training classes, conducting demonstrations and training of advanced experiences according to the type of work, overcoming some workers' conservative thinking, and mobilizing them to study the operation process. A group of apprentices was also trained. These efforts are very important for promoting advanced experiences. Therefore, at the start of construction, the inside workers of our company all entered the site according to advanced organization, and some of the outside workers, because they had received training in other places, also entered the site according to advanced organization. This was undoubtedly a good start.

    However, on the other hand, two new situations also emerged at that time: one was that the proportion of new members in the bricklayers was large, and most of last year's apprentices became technicians this year, so many new small workers were added to the inside bricklayers. The other was that at this time, Su Changyou's team had successfully tested the Soviet Shavlyugin's double-handed mortar squeezing method, and adopted Tianjin Fu Hongbin's mortar spreading device, which greatly improved the bricklaying effect compared with last year's continuous bricklaying method. Leading cadres did not study these situations well, and did not try to improve the skills of the bricklayers' small workers on the one hand, and focus on promoting the double-handed mortar squeezing method on the other hand. Instead, they impatiently proposed to universally adopt the double-handed mortar squeezing method, regardless of the workers' technical level, and trained workers to try double-handed mortar squeezing. As a result, some bricklayers who had learned the continuous bricklaying method were not yet proficient, and new small workers were added, and the materials were supplied by newly arrived outside workers, so the coordination was not good, and the efficiency was reduced instead. As for the inside workers who were already more proficient in the continuous bricklaying method, the leading cadres asked them to start from scratch and immediately adopt double-handed mortar squeezing. In addition, the leading cadres did not conduct in-depth research on issues such as mortar spreading devices, labor organization, technology, and workers' thinking, and did not solve them in time, so their efficiency was not high either. Individual construction site leading cadres did not pay attention to solving these difficulties of the workers, but only knew to issue orders: "Everyone must squeeze with both hands, no large trowels allowed, using large trowels is backward, and being backward will be criticized!" Therefore, chaos formed in some construction sites, the workers' enthusiasm for learning advanced experience was not high, and production efficiency was very low.

    In contrast, some construction sites quickly changed this approach, deeply investigated the workers' technical level and ideological situation, and specifically studied the advantages of various advanced experiences with the workers, promoting the whole from a point of experimentation, and solving the difficulties in promotion in a timely manner. Construction sites that did this immediately changed. For example, the Industrial University construction site of the Fifth Engineering Office, under the influence of Su Changyou's advanced team, has fully implemented the advanced bricklaying method of double-handed mortar squeezing. The twelfth construction site had a most backward team, which had never met the quota for bricklaying, but now it has exceeded the quota, reaching a record of nearly 2,000 bricks laid per person per day.

    These facts show that the reason why advanced experience cannot be promoted is because of the bureaucratic style of the leading cadres. Only by overcoming the bureaucratic style of the leading cadres, going deep into reality, going deep into the lower levels, and studying and solving the problems in promoting advanced experience can advanced experience be promoted. In particular, strengthening the leadership of construction sites is even more important. Because the construction site is the basic unit directly responsible for construction, without strengthening the leadership of the construction site, advanced experience is difficult to be promoted.

### 官僚主义作风把事情弄坏了

    官僚主义作风把事情弄坏了
    东北工业部建设工程公司经理  张潭
    东北建设工程公司在哈尔滨地区所属工地推广苏长有砌砖先进经验，谢万福木工流水作业先进经验，及杨德重抹灰先进经验，是有很大收获的。木工几乎百分之百的学习了谢万福流水作业法，瓦工实行双手挤浆连续砌砖法的已达到百分之八十以上（当然熟练的程度还有区别）。但在推广这些先进经验时，也曾走过一段弯路。
    去冬今春，公司办了施工员小队长训练班，也请了各先进小组的人作了报告，并组织实地表演。各工程处也办过工人训练班，依工种进行先进经验的表演及训练，克服了某些工人的保守思想，发动他们研究操作过程。并又训练了一批徒工。这些工作对推广先进经验都是很重要的。因此，在开工的时候，我们公司的里工一律按先进的组织进入了现场，外工因为有的在地方上受过训练，部分也按先进的组织进入了现场。这无疑地是一个好的开端。
    但是，另一方面，当时也出现了两种新的情况：一种是瓦工中新成分比例数大，去年的徒工今年大部变成了技工，瓦工里工中就新增加了不少的小工。另一种是这时苏长有小组试用苏联沙夫留金的双手挤浆法已经成功，并采用了天津傅鸿宾的铺灰器，砌砖效果比去年的连续砌砖法又大大地提高了。领导干部没有很好研究这些情况，没有设法一方面提高瓦工小工的技术，另方面有重点地推行双手挤浆法，而不顾工人的技术水平，急躁地提出普遍采用双手挤浆法，并训练工人试用双手挤浆。结果，部分学过连续砌砖法的瓦工尚不熟练，又新添了小工，上料供料的又全是新来的外工，因此配合不好，效率反而降低。而已经较熟练了连续砌砖法的里工，领导干部又叫他们从头学起，马上采用双手挤浆，加之领导干部对铺灰器，劳动组织，技术，工人思想等问题，都没有加以深入的研究，及时予以解决，因而他们的效率也不高。个别工地领导干部，更没有注意去解决工人的这些困难，只知下命令：“一律双手挤，不准拿大铲，拿大铲就是落后，落后就要受批评！”因此，部分工地形成了混乱现象，工人学习先进经验的情绪不高，生产效率很低。
    与此相反，有些工地很快就转变了这种作法，深入地调查了工人技术水平和思想情况，同工人一起具体研究了各种先进经验的优越性，从一点作试验推动全盘，并及时地解决了推广中的困难问题。凡是这样做的工地马上就起了变化。如第五工程处工业大学工地在苏长有先进小组影响下，已全部推行了双手挤浆的先进砌砖法。第十二工地有一个最落后的小组，从来砌砖达不到定额，现在也超过了定额，达到每人每天砌砖将近二千块的纪录。
    这些事实说明了先进经验所以推广不了，就是因为领导干部的官僚主义在作怪。只有克服了领导干部的官僚主义，深入实际，深入下层，研究和解决推广先进经验中的问题，先进经验就可以被推广起来。特别是加强工地领导问题，更为重要。因为工地是直接负责施工的基层单位，不加强对工地的领导，先进经验是难被推广的。
