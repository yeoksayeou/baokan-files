Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The national universities and colleges' current graduating class, and the third-year science and engineering students graduating early, have completed their studies and are about to graduate and participate in national construction work. According to the "Decision on Reforming the School System" promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government on October 1, 1951, the work of university graduates will be allocated by the government in a unified manner. Currently, the Personnel Department of the Central People's Government has consulted with the Ministry of Education and relevant departments to formulate the 1952 summer national university graduate unified allocation plan. University graduates nationwide will be assigned work according to this plan.

In order to meet the needs of large-scale national construction, in addition to the current graduating class, this summer, universities and colleges will also graduate third-year science and engineering students early to meet urgent needs. Even so, the number of university graduates this summer still cannot keep up with the needs of national construction. In order to allocate the limited number of university graduates to the most needed work posts in the country in a planned manner, the basic principle of the unified allocation of university graduates this summer is: centralized use and key allocation. First, is to try to meet the needs of national basic construction, and concentrate a large number of science, engineering, economics, finance, and some agricultural graduates to the construction, renovation, and expansion of factories, mines, transportation, and water conservancy projects for surveying, design, and installation. In general, factories, mines, and administrative departments of organs will not be allocated unless there are special circumstances. Second, is to strengthen education construction and scientific research work. In order to adapt to the development of higher education and scientific research, this year a considerable number of graduates will be assigned as teaching assistants, graduate students, and research interns in research institutions affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Regarding the allocation of teachers for secondary schools, in addition to all graduates of higher normal schools, a part of the graduates of liberal arts colleges will also be assigned to teaching positions. Regarding the allocation of medical graduates, they will mainly be assigned to factories, mines, epidemic prevention, and state staff public medical institutions. Graduates in law and political science will generally be allocated work by major administrative regions. Graduates in foreign languages (Russian, English), in addition to a small number retained and allocated by major administrative regions, will be largely centrally allocated by the central government. Necessary consideration will also be given to privately-run industrial and commercial enterprises and hospitals in the allocation of graduates. In addition to on-the-job personnel from private enterprises in night schools established by universities, who will still be assigned back to their original enterprises, major administrative regions will make appropriate adjustments. In accordance with the above principles, when carrying out the allocation of university graduates, local people's governments will also implement the principle of aligning learning with application on the basis of meeting the needs of national construction, in accordance with the "Instructions on Several Issues in Adjusting the Work of University Graduates" issued by the State Council on June 18 and the People's Daily editorial "Put Specialized Technical Talents in the Most Needed Positions for Economic Construction" on June 14.

An important part of doing a good job in the allocation of university graduates lies in doing a good job in mobilizing and educating graduating students. After the "Three-Anti" movement and the ideological remolding movement, the students' political awareness and ideological level have generally improved, but some people still lack sufficient understanding of the unified allocation work. Therefore, various localities are continuing to strengthen political and ideological education for graduates, inspiring graduates' love for the motherland and their enthusiasm to devote themselves to the motherland's construction, and enhancing their understanding of the unified allocation work, so that they can consciously, voluntarily and happily go to their work posts.

Regarding the treatment of university graduates, no special provisions will be made this year, that is, it will be handled according to the "Notice on the Issuance of Subsidy Standards for Staff on the Supply System and Salary Standards for Staff on the Wage System at All Levels of the People's Government" issued by the State Council on July 5, based on the work positions they hold.

### 中央人民政府人事部制定方案  统一分配高等学校毕业生

    中央人民政府人事部制定方案
    统一分配高等学校毕业生
    【新华社六日讯】全国高等学校应届毕业生和三年级提前毕业的理工科学生已完成他们的学业，即将毕业，参加国家建设工作。根据一九五一年十月一日中央人民政府政务院公布的“关于改革学制的决定”，高等学校毕业生的工作由政府统筹分配。现中央人民政府人事部已与教育部及各有关部门商洽制定一九五二年暑期全国高等学校毕业生统一分配方案。全国高等学校毕业生将根据这个方案分配工作。
    为了适应大规模的国家建设的需要，今年暑期全国高等学校除应届毕业生外，并将三年级的理、工等科学生提前毕业，以应急需。虽然如此，今年暑期高等学校毕业生的数量，还是赶不上国家建设的需要。为了把为数有限的高等学校毕业生有计划地分配到国家最需要的工作岗位上去，今年暑期高等学校毕业生统一分配工作的基本方针是：集中使用，重点配备。首先，是尽量满足国家基本建设的需要，把大量理、工、财经等科及部分农科的毕业生，集中配备到新建、改建和扩建的厂矿、交通、水利事业中的勘测、设计和安装等工作上去，一般厂矿和机关行政部门除特殊情况外，不予配备。其次，是加强教育建设和科学研究工作。为了适应高等教育发展和科学研究工作的需要，今年将分配相当数量的毕业生作高等学校的助教、研究生和中国科学院所属研究机构的研究实习员。关于配备中等学校师资，除高等师范学校全部毕业生外，并配备
    一部分文理学院的毕业生担任教师工作。关于医科毕业生的分配，主要配备在厂矿、防疫及国家工作人员公费医疗机构。政法类毕业生，一般由各大行政区分配工作。外文系（俄文、英文）毕业生，除酌留一部分由各大行政区分配工作外，绝大部分由中央集中分配。对私人办理的工商企业和医院，在分配毕业生上也将给以必要的照顾，除高等学校所设夜校中原属私营企业的在职人员，仍分配回原企业工作外，各大行政区将斟酌调配。按照上述方针，各地人民政府在进行高等学校毕业生分配工作时，并根据政务院六月十八日所发“关于调整高等学校毕业生工作中几个问题的指示”和六月十四日人民日报社论“把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”的精神，在适应国家建设需要的基础上贯彻学用一致的原则。
    做好高等学校毕业生分配工作的重要环节，在于做好对毕业学生的动员教育工作。各高等学校经过“三反”运动和思想改造运动，学生的政治觉悟和思想水平，一般已提高了一步，但也还有人对统一分配工作，缺乏足够的认识。因此，各地正在继续加强对毕业生的政治思想教育工作，启发毕业生对祖国的热爱及准备献身于祖国建设事业的热情，提高他们对统一分配工作的认识，使他们自觉自愿愉快地走上工作岗位。
    关于高等学校毕业生的待遇，今年不作特殊规定，即根据其所任工作职务，按照政务院七月五日所发“关于颁发各级人民政府供给制工作人员津贴标准及工资制工作人员工资标准的通知”办理。
