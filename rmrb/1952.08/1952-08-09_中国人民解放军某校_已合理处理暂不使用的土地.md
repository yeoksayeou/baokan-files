    A Certain School of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Has Properly Handled Temporarily Unused Land
    Editor: Our school, due to teaching needs, once requisitioned more than 1,100 mu of land in the northern suburbs from the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Later, due to changes in the teaching plan, a portion of the land was not immediately used. On June 25th, the "Reader's Letters" page published a reader's letter of criticism. Our school immediately submitted a request to the higher authorities for approval to return more than 500 mu of land, which the People's Government temporarily distributed to nearby farmers for cultivation.
    We are very grateful to the readers for their helpful suggestions. We hope that the broad masses of the people will continue to help us in the future, so as to improve our work and strengthen the relationship between the army and the people.
    Qi Tao, Director of the Political Department of a Certain School of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中国人民解放军某校
    已合理处理暂不使用的土地
    编辑同志：我校因为教学需要，曾向北京市人民政府领用了北郊一千一百多亩土地。后来因为教学计划改变了，有一部分土地没有立即使用。六月二十五日“读者来信专页”发表了读者的批评信，我校立即呈请上级批准，退回五百多亩土地，由人民政府暂时分给附近农民耕种。
    我们非常感激读者对我们提出的有益的意见。希望广大人民群众今后更多地帮助我们，以便改进工作，密切军民关系。中国人民解放军某校政治部主任  齐陶
