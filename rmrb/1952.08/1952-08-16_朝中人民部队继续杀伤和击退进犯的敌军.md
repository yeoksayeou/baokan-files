Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 13th: In the past few days, a relatively fierce battle has taken place in the vicinity of Jwaseo-dong southeast of Kimhwa on the central front. On the night of the 5th, our artillery bombarded enemy positions south of Jwaseo-dong, after which infantry units swiftly stormed into the enemy positions, annihilating a platoon of enemy puppet troops. Our forces then repelled fourteen enemy counterattacks in succession. After killing and wounding over two hundred enemy soldiers, our forces withdrew from the area on their own initiative. In the three days that followed, our forces continued to launch powerful counterattacks against enemy forces in the vicinity of Jwaseo-dong. In the fierce battle for the mountain positions, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. From the 5th to the 8th, our forces annihilated approximately six hundred enemy troops in this area.

	In other parts of the front, our forces continuously inflicted casualties on the enemy by repelling their attacks and launching small-scale counterattacks. On the 6th, two enemy platoons attacked our positions on an unnamed height north of Kimhwa, but were repulsed after suffering casualties from our fierce fire. On the 7th, enemy forces, ranging from two platoons to one company in strength, attacked two of our positions southeast of Saknyong several times, but were all repulsed by our forces, with the enemy suffering approximately sixty casualties. On the same day, enemy forces, with two companies under the cover of six tanks, attacked our positions northwest of Kimhwa, but were also repulsed by our forces, with the enemy suffering over one hundred and thirty casualties. On the 9th and 10th, the American aggressor troops, deliberately sabotaging the truce talks, launched repeated attacks on an unnamed height more than ten miles east of the Panmunjom conference area. The brave soldiers of our forces, guarding the safety of the conference area, resolutely repulsed the invading enemy and killed or wounded more than fifty of them.

    朝中人民部队继续杀伤和击退进犯的敌军
    【新华社朝鲜前线十三日电】最近几天在中部战线金城东南座首洞附近地区发生了一场比较激烈的战斗。五日夜，我军大炮向座首洞以南某处敌军阵地进行轰击，随后步兵部队即以迅猛的动作一举突入敌军阵地，歼灭守敌伪军一个班。我军接着又连续击退敌军十四次反击，在达到杀伤敌军二百多名的目的后，就主动撤出了这个地方。在这以后的三天中，我军继续向座首洞附近地区敌军进行有力的反击。在激烈的山地争夺战中，敌军遭到了严重的杀伤。自五日至八日，我军在这一带共歼灭敌军六百名左右。
    在战线的其它地方，我军也不断地在打退敌军的进犯和举行小型反击战中杀伤敌军。六日，敌军两个排向金化以北一个无名高地上的我军阵地进犯，遭到我军炽烈火力的杀伤后溃退。七日，敌军以两个排到一个连的兵力向朔宁东南的我军两处阵地进犯多次，都被我军击退，敌军伤亡六十名左右。同日，敌军又以两个连兵力在六辆战车掩护下进犯金化西北某处我军阵地，也被我军击退，敌军伤亡一百三十多名。九日和十日，蓄意破坏停战谈判的美国侵略军曾连续向板门店会场区以东十多里的某无名高地进行多次进犯。保卫会场区安全的我军勇士们坚决击退了进犯的敌人，并杀伤其五十多名。
