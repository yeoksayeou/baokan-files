Comrades of the sports and art teams of the entire army! All commanders and combatants participating in various military sports performances!

The first All-Army Sports Meet, held to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and also marking the rapid progress of the Chinese People's Liberation Army towards regularization and modernization, has now successfully concluded after ten days of intense and enthusiastic competition.

The scale of our sports meet, the richness of its content, and the excellence of its results are unprecedented in the history of our army. In terms of the results of various competitions, we have broken the national records since liberation in several events and created new achievements. Other events have also reached or approached the national level. Our various military sports performances have also been very exciting and outstanding. Hundreds of thousands of spectators have unanimously praised the progress we have made in a short period. Our cultural education has also developed rapidly due to the promotion of the "quick literacy method" and the efforts of the vast number of commanders and combatants. In particular, the enterprising spirit, learning spirit, discipline, and spirit of unity and friendship displayed by each delegation throughout the competition reflect the fine traditions of our People's Liberation Army and demonstrate the noble virtues of our army's sports activities. This sports meet can be said to have made a good start for our army's sports activities, and its future is very bright.

Comrades, our sports meet is, on the one hand, a general review of the achievements we have made in promoting military sports in the army over the past two years. At the same time, on the other hand, and perhaps more importantly, it is to use this sports meet to more vigorously develop and promote military sports in the army in the future. As comrades know, the construction of a modern national defense force requires not only our army's commanders and combatants to have a higher level of political awareness, military technology and military science, and a certain level of education, but also requires our army's commanders and combatants to have stronger physiques and lasting physical strength. The normal and widespread development of sports is an effective way to exercise our bodies and enhance our physical strength. Moreover, sports are also a good place to cultivate our organizational and disciplinary skills, develop our enterprising spirit, spirit of cooperation, perseverance, and agility. Therefore, it is a serious political task before us to universally develop sports in the army, to make it not just a sport for a few people, but to turn it into a mass movement for the broad masses, to make it not just a temporary phenomenon, but to achieve regular and sound development.

Male and female athletes who participated in this All-Army Sports Meet, you are the outstanding members of the army's sports activities, and the serious task of developing sports activities in the army falls on your shoulders first. It is hoped that through your love and skills in sports, you will organize a surge of amateur sports in the army, mobilize all commanders and combatants to participate in various forms of sports, but at least one sport per person; and at the same time, adhere to and implement the virtues of military sports in various sports, so that the army's sports activities become a powerful assistant for the further construction of a modern national defense army.

Comrades, officers and soldiers, now, on behalf of the Presidium of the Congress, I announce the successful conclusion of the first All-Army Sports Meet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the 25th Anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day. Let us continue to carry forward the achievements of the Congress, let us firmly remember Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions: "Develop sports and strengthen the people's physique," "Exercise ourselves to become iron-like physiques to defend our most beloved country."

As the Congress closes, let me, on behalf of the Presidium, thank the comrades of the sports and art teams and all the commanders and combatants who participated in the various military sports performances, and also thank all the staff members who served this sports meet. I wish you good health and progress!

    在解放军体育运动大会闭幕典礼上
    聂荣臻代总参谋长的闭幕词全军各项体育运动和文艺工作的选手同志们！参加各种军事体育表演的全体指挥员、战斗员同志们！
    为了庆祝中国人民解放军建军二十五周年而举行的、同时也标志着中国人民解放军迅速地走上正规化、现代化道路的第一次全军体育运动大会，经过了紧张、热烈的十天竞赛之后，现在已经顺利地结束了。
    我们这次的运动大会，其规模的伟大，内容之丰富，成绩的优良，是我军历史上空前所未有的。在各种比赛的成绩上，我们已有若干项目突破了解放以来全国的最高纪录，创造了新的成绩，其他各种项目也都达到了或接近了全国的水平；我们的各项军事体育表演，也表现得十分精彩和出色，数十万观众对于我们在短短的时间内所获得的进步，一致予以好评；我们的文化教育，由于“速成识字法”的推行和广大指挥员、战斗员的努力，也得到飞速的发展；尤其是在整个竞赛过程中，各个代表队所表现出来的进取的精神、学习的精神、纪律的精神以及团结友爱的精神，更反映出我们人民解放军的优良传统，显示了我们部队体育运动的崇高美德。这次的体育运动大会，可以说给我们全军的体育运动作了一个良好的开端，其前途是十分光明的。
    同志们，我们这次的运动大会，一方面是对于我们两年来在部队中开展军事体育运动的成绩作了一次总检阅，同时，另一方面，也可以说是更重要的一面，是在于通过这次的运动大会来更有力地开展和推动部队今后的军事体育运动。这个道理，正如同志们所知道的，现代化的国防部队的建设，不仅需要我们全军的指挥员、战斗员具有更高度的政治觉悟、军事技术和军事科学的水准，以及一定的文化程度，同时也要求我们全军的指挥员、战斗员具有更加强健的体格和持久的体力。体育运动的正常而广泛的开展，就正是锻炼我们的身体，增强我们的体力的有效办法；而且不仅仅这样，体育运动同时又是培养我们的组织性和纪律性，发挥我们的进取精神、协同动作精神、坚忍耐劳精神和灵敏机智种种美德的良好场所。因此，在部队中普遍地把体育运动开展起来，使它不仅是少数人的运动，使它变成为广大的群众性的运动，使它不只是一种临时的现象，使它获得经常而健全的发展，这是摆在我们面前的一个严重的政治任务。
    参加这次全军体育运动大会的男女选手们，你们是部队体育运动的优秀分子，开展部队体育运动的严重任务，首先就落在你们身上。希望通过你们对体育运动的爱好和技能，在部队中组织起一个业余的体育运动的热潮，把全体的指挥员、战斗员都动员起来，参加到各种各式的、但至少是每人一项的体育运动的战线上去；同时并在各项体育运动中，坚持和贯彻部队体育运动的美德，使部队的体育运动成为更进一步地建设现代化国防军的有力助手。
    全体指战员同志们，现在我代表大会主席团，宣告中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年第一届全军体育运动大会胜利地闭幕了，让我们继续发扬大会的成绩，让我们牢牢地记住毛主席和朱总司令的指示：“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”，“锻炼自己成为铁的体质，保卫我们最可爱的国家”。
    当大会闭幕的时候，让我再代表主席团感谢这次各项体育运动和文艺工作的选手同志们以及参加这次各项军事体育表演的全体指挥员、战斗员同志们，也感谢为这次运动大会服务的全体工作人员同志们，祝你们健康，祝你们进步！
