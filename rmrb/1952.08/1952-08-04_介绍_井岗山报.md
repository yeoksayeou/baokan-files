Introducing the "Jinggangshan Daily"
    Dong Qian
    "In the Jinggangshan Daily,
    We see Chairman Mao,
    And we hear Chairman Mao's words,
    He guides us forward."
    These words are a true expression of the Jinggangshan area people's love for Chairman Mao and the Jinggangshan Daily. For more than two years, the Jinggangshan Daily (founded on April 5, 1950, formerly known as "Masses' Newspaper," renamed on October 4 of the same year, a thrice-weekly publication) has been growing and enriching itself under the encouragement of the powerful force of the broad masses in the Jinggangshan area and under the direct leadership of the Ji'an Prefectural Committee of the CPC. It has become a powerful weapon for the Party and Chairman Mao to maintain constant contact with the masses in the Jinggangshan area.

    The Jinggangshan area is mostly an old revolutionary base area from the Second Domestic Revolutionary War period, encompassing eleven counties and one city, with a population of nearly two million (of which farmers account for about 1.6 to 1.7 million). The broad masses of farmers have a glorious tradition of struggle. After the liberation of the entire area in September 1949, they underwent a series of mass movements, such as rent reduction and repayment of deposits, eliminating bandits and countering local bullies, land reform, resisting America and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, further enhancing their political awareness. With political and economic emancipation, the peasant masses have an urgent desire for cultural emancipation. On the one hand, they want to hear Chairman Mao's voice frequently, understand the Party and the People's Government's various policies, laws, and all new knowledge. On the other hand, they also want to fully express their past suffering, sing the praises of their new life, and share their hopes for the future. Therefore, for more than two years, the Jinggangshan Daily has gradually established a close relationship with the masses in Jinggangshan, becoming an indispensable good teacher and helpful friend in their political and cultural life. As of July 15 this year, the circulation of the Jinggangshan Daily has increased from 8,000 copies in the same month last year to 14,000 copies, and the number of reading groups has grown to 658. Farmers' night schools, mutual aid groups, and training courses all use the Jinggangshan Daily as regular learning material and a political textbook. Through studying the newspaper, the broad masses of farmers have initially clarified the class boundaries with the landlords, recognized the greatness of the motherland, recognized the bright future of the farmers, overcome the slackening, regression, selfishness, paralysis, and political indifference tendencies of some cadres and masses, exchanged advanced production experiences, and thereby promoted the patriotic production increase movement in the entire Jinggangshan area.

    The biggest feature of the Jinggangshan Daily is its extensive use of folk forms such as mountain songs and tea tunes, created and loved by the Jinggangshan area masses, to popularly publicize the Party's policies and reflect the struggles of the broad masses of farmers. The Jinggangshan Daily has regularly published such mountain songs, tea tunes, and clapperdash since its inception. From November 28 last year, a small column called "Songs of Jinggangshan" was added, and the newspaper office has held more than ten mass "mountain song joint singing sessions" (i.e., group singing around a central issue, with each person singing a section). The participants in the joint singing are all farmers, workers, or production activists. The content of the joint singing varies with the central task of each period, such as singing about Chairman Mao, increasing production and practicing economy, land reform, the People's Liberation Army, harvest, and the second anniversary of the founding of the new China, all of which are relatively vivid and moving mountain songs. Here are just a few excerpts:

    The sun rises over the mountain, a touch of red
    China has a great savior
    If you ask who the savior is
    It is leader Mao Zedong (excerpt from "Recollection")

    Better to have Mao and Zhu than parents alive
    Better to have the Red Army than anything else (excerpt from "Anticipation")

    Golden osmanthus
    Yellow and yellow
    Chairman Mao's troops return to their hometown (excerpt from "Return")

    People's Leader Mao Zedong
    Leading the revolution is truly glorious
    The Long March, the War of Resistance, the Liberation War
    Fought for a land covered in red (excerpt from "Gratitude")

    These mountain songs are excerpted from the "Jinggangshan People Sing of Chairman Mao" mountain song joint singing session on July 1 this year. They vividly reflect how the Chinese revolution progressed from victory to victory and the people's love for their leader. In the "Everyone Sing Praises of the People's Liberation Army" mountain song joint singing session on August 1 last year, the people's love for the People's Liberation Army and the growth and development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were similarly expressed.

    The Jinggangshan Daily not only uses mountain songs to sing praises of victory but also as a weapon for criticism and self-criticism. The newspaper reported on May 16 and June 13 that Changling and Douchong, Worang and Gucheng and other townships in Ninggang promoted production by using mountain songs. Therefore, this method of propaganda, which widely uses folk art forms to reflect the lives of the masses, is worth learning and referencing by vernacular newspapers at the factory, special district, and county levels.

    The editorial department of the Jinggangshan Daily is not complacent with these achievements. During the "Three-Anti" movement, they strictly criticized the petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ideas of the staff members to strengthen the ideological nature of the newspaper. In the work summary, they pointed out that it is necessary to treat every link of the peasant movement with the proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, and method, and to strengthen the leadership of the working class over the peasants and strengthen the education of patriotism and the socialist future through "living people, living events, and living principles" in a concrete rather than conceptual way, and in a systematic rather than piecemeal way. It requires every editor to invest in actual struggle, enrich life, strengthen mass viewpoints, and make their thoughts and feelings consistent with those of the masses, and to write reports that are popular, vivid, ideological, and full of rich emotion, and to overcome the tendency of generality and stereotyped articles. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the organizational leadership of communication work and reading group work in a planned way, and attract the participation of the broad masses of peasant activists in running the newspaper, to enhance the ideological and mass nature of the newspaper.

### 介绍“井岗山报”

    介绍“井岗山报”
    董谦
    “我们在井岗山报上，
    看到了毛主席，
    也听到了毛主席的话，
    他指引着我们前进。”
    这几句话，是井岗山区人民热爱毛主席和井岗山报的真情流露。井岗山报二年多来（一九五○年四月五日创刊，前身为“群众报”，同年十月四日改名，系三日刊。）就是在井岗山区广大人民这种力量的鼓舞下，和中央吉安地委的直接领导下，日渐成长和充实起来，并成为党和毛主席经常联系井岗山区群众的一个有力的武器。
    井岗山区大部分是第二次国内革命战争时期的老区，它包括有十一个县一个市，近二百万人口（其中农民约占一百六、七十万）。广大农民具有光荣的斗争传统。一九四九年九月全山区解放后，他们又经过减租退押、清匪反霸、土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命等一系列的群众运动，政治觉悟更进一步提高。随着政治上、经济上的翻身，农民群众就有文化上翻身的迫切要求。他们一方面要求经常听到毛主席的声音，了解党与人民政府的各种政策法令和一切新的知识，另一方面也要求尽情地倾吐他们过去的苦、歌唱现在新的生活和对未来的希望。因此，井岗山报二年多来，已逐渐与井岗山的群众建立了血肉的联系，成为群众政治文化生活中不可缺少的良师益友。截至今年七月十五日止，井岗山报的发行量，已由去年同月的八千份增加到一万四千份，读报组已发展到六百五十八个。农民的夜校、互助组、训练班都把井岗山报作为经常的学习材料和政治课本。广大农民经过对报纸的学习，已初步划清了和地主的阶级界限，认识了祖国的伟大，认识了农民未来的美好远景，克服了部分干部群众松劲、退坡、自私、麻痹和不问政治的倾向，交流了先进生产经验，并从而推动了全井岗山区的爱国增产运动。
    井岗山报最大的特色是广泛地利用了井岗山区群众创造的和喜爱的山歌、茶曲等形式，通俗地宣传了党的政策，反映了广大农民的斗争。井岗山报从创刊起就经常刊登这样一些山歌、茶曲和快板。从去年十一月二十八日起，更增辟了“井岗山的歌声”小专栏，并由报社先后举办了十几次群众的“山歌联唱大会”（即：围绕一个中心问题，你唱一段、他唱一段的合唱）。参加联唱的都是农民、工人或生产积极分子。联唱的内容，都是随着每个时期的中心工作有所不同，如歌唱毛主席、增产节约、土地改革、人民解放军、丰收、新中国成立两周年等，都是比较生动感人的山歌。这里仅摘引几首来看：
    日头出山一点红
    中国有了大救星
     要问救星是那个
    就是领袖毛泽东（摘自“回忆”）
    爹在娘在不如毛朱在
    千好万好不如红军好（摘自“盼望”）
    金桂花
    黄又黄
    毛主席队伍回家乡（摘自“归来”）
    人民领袖毛泽东
    领导革命真光荣
    长征抗日解放战
    打出江山满地红（摘自“感谢”）
    这几首山歌，是从今年七月一日“井岗山人民歌唱毛主席”的山歌联唱中摘引的。它通俗生动地反映了中国革命怎样从胜利走向胜利，和人民群众对领袖的热爱。在去年八月一日“大家来歌颂人民解放军”的山歌联唱大会中，同样表达了人民群众对人民解放军的热爱，和中国人民解放军的成长和发展。
    井岗山报不仅把山歌用作歌唱胜利，而且用作进行批评和自我批评的武器。该报五月十六日、六月十三日报道了宁冈长岭和豆冲、沃壤和古城等乡利用山歌推动了生产的消息。因此，这种广泛利用民间文艺形式反映群众自己生活的宣传方法，值得各工厂和专区、县级的通俗报学习和参考。
    井岗山报编辑部并不以这点成绩自满。他们在“三反”运动期间，曾严格地批判了工作人员中的小资产阶级和资产阶级思想，以加强报纸的思想性；并在工作总结中指出：必须用无产阶级的立场、观点、方法来对待农民运动的每一个环节，通过“活人、活事、活道理”，具体地而不是概念地，系统地而不是零碎地来加强工人阶级对农民的领导作用，加强爱国主义与社会主义前途的教育。它要求每个编辑人员投入实际斗争，丰富生活，加强群众观点，使自己的思想感情和群众的思想感情一致起来，通俗生动地编写出有思想性有丰富感情的报道，克服一般化、条文化的偏向。同时，还须有计划地加强通讯工作和读报组工作的组织领导，吸引广大农民积极分子参加办报，以增强报纸的思想性群众性。
