Esteemed Guests, Comrades, All Athletes and Performers of the Representative Teams, and Representative Comrades:

The first grand and comprehensive sports meet of the entire army, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Army Day, has been successfully convened and carried out, and is about to come to a victorious close today!

Our conference, under the direct leadership of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, with the strong call and active support of leaders at all levels of various units, with the full assistance of various agencies and organizations in Beijing, especially many colleagues in the sports circles, and with the concerted efforts of all athletes, performers, and representative comrades of the representative teams, has been a great success. Our conference is a victorious and successful conference!

First: Our conference has consistently demonstrated a high spirit of unity. This conference is unprecedentedly grand in our army and nationwide. The competition events include 38 kinds of military sports, ball games, track and field, swimming, arts, acrobatics, etc. There are also more than 20 kinds of performance events, such as aviation sports, water sports, equestrianism, motorcycle, and group exercises. In terms of the number of participants, excluding athletes participating in various performance events, there are more than 3,500 athletes and literary and art workers participating in the competition events alone. Some came from the mainland, some from the border areas, and some from the Chinese People's Volunteers from the Korean front. In terms of ethnicity, there are not only Han people, but also Mongolians from Inner Mongolia in North China, Uyghurs from Xinjiang, and Koreans from Northeast China. The representatives include not only numerous combatants and junior and middle-level cadres, but also senior cadres above the division level. Throughout the conference, a new style of mutual respect, mutual learning, and mutual assistance was consciously established, and the atmosphere was full of close unity and competition, and the inherent fine tradition of our People's Liberation Army was promoted.

Second: Through this conference, we have reviewed the powerful force of the combat-oriented and mass-based cultural and sports activities of our troops, and demonstrated the spirit of revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism of our army. Commander-in-Chief Zhu instructed us at the opening ceremony of the conference: "Today, on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the army, we are holding the All-Army Sports Meet. Our task is to review the achievements of the troops in cultural education, sports, military technology, and literary and artistic activities, promote strengths, exchange experiences, so as to effectively promote the training of the troops." The conference proceeded in accordance with Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions, indicating that since the beginning of cultural learning this year, illiteracy has been eliminated in many of our troops, and the cultural level of our troops has been generally improved. In terms of sports and military technology, our troops have also made great strides forward. Since the All-Army Basketball and Volleyball Competition last year, the basketball and volleyball movement in our army has been significantly improved. In track and field, the Southwest Military Region's score in the women's 4x100 meter relay was 54.6 seconds; the Northeast Military Region's score in the men's 4x800 meter relay was 1 minute 35.7 seconds; the Southwest Military Region's score in the women's 4x800 meter relay was 1 minute 55.5 seconds; the Military Academy's score in the men's 4x1600 meter relay was 3 minutes 34.5 seconds; the Air Force's score in the women's long jump was 5.02 meters; these records have all broken the national record levels since liberation. The military sports motorcycle athletes' performance of "soaring over" even created a new record of 12 meters. The singing programs rated as first-class in the literary and artistic competition include "I am a Soldier," "Singing Erlang Mountain," "Heroic Automobile Driver," "Speaking in the Flood Storage Area," and "Reconnaissance Hero Han Qifa"; the dance programs rated as first-class include "Soldier's Game Dance," "Road Building Dance," "Artillery Dance," "Tunnel Dance," and "Engine Room Soldier Dance"; there are also more than a dozen other songs and dances rated as second-class, and more than thirty rated as third-class; more than ten outstanding literary and art workers of the troops won awards. All these songs and dances not only demonstrate the rich fighting life of various services, but also are full of joyful emotions and a fighting atmosphere, demonstrating the heroic spirit and revolutionary optimism of our army. It is worth mentioning that the song "Quartermaster's Seasonal Tune" was written and sung by Comrade Zhang Fusheng, a quartermaster from a certain unit of the Volunteers; the dances "Engineer Dance," "Tank Soldier Dance," and "Tunnel Dance" were all collectively created by soldiers. All these songs and dances reflect their rich life and vigorous fighting emotions, and are full of healthy pride and confidence in victory. Various acrobatic programs are also full of new, lively and cheerful emotions, with exquisite and skilled techniques, combined with military sports. Comrades, it is by no means a simple matter that we have shown such rich and numerous contents in such a short period of time and achieved such great results. This is the result of our consistent efforts to implement Chairman Mao's instructions and strive to build a regular and modern national defense army on the basis of our existing fine traditions! It is the result of the firm implementation of the Military Commission's decision on cultural learning by the vast number of commanders and combatants! This is the result of the great promotion of revolutionary heroism by the vast number of commanders and combatants! This is the result of the firm implementation of the correct policy of the General Political Department of the Military Commission to develop combat-oriented mass literary and artistic movements, "facing the company and serving the soldiers" by leaders at all levels and all literary and art workers!

Third: This conference has always implemented the spirit of learning. Everyone knows that this conference is to promote cultural learning in the troops, further develop sports and entertainment activities in the troops, so that all commanders and combatants have a high level of cultural accomplishment, and exercise strong bodies and good qualities of bravery, perseverance, agility, and collectivism, laying a solid foundation for the construction of a modern national defense army. The conference organizes revolutionary competitions and stipulates victory or defeat, simply because this is the best way to promote learning and progress. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to proceed from the standpoint of collectivism, promote revolutionary heroism, study diligently and practice hard, strive for excellence, and use it as a typical demonstration to popularize it throughout the army. This is completely opposed to the Jintaiism of harming others for personal gain, which starts from individuals in the old society. In this conference, in various competitions, all comrades showed the excellent qualities of not being arrogant in victory and not being discouraged in defeat. Everyone can grasp the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, learn from each other very modestly, and exchange experiences through various methods, develop a high degree of enterprising spirit, and continue to make unremitting efforts to improve technology. This is worthy of our praise. In particular, all athletes have generally established a new style of sportsmanship. Comrades! The reason why you have such good performance is not only because you deeply understand that the direct purpose of participating in the conference is to learn and progress, and to build a modern national defense army, but also because our army has always been an army with a high degree of revolutionary heroism, and we must carry forward this spirit.

Fourth: Each representative team has demonstrated the collectivist spirit of obeying organization and observing discipline. Each representative team can resolutely implement the system stipulated by the conference and implement it very well. All comrades participating in the conference have demonstrated a high degree of organizational discipline everywhere, ensuring the successful conduct of the conference and winning the unanimous praise of the broad masses of the audience. Comrades! This is the characteristic of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and it is also something we can all be proud of.

We believe that this conference will definitely be able to play a more extensive and in-depth role in mobilizing, calling, demonstrating, and organizing the promotion and in-depth popularization of cultural and sports activities in the troops. We Chinese people, especially the vast number of commanders and combatants of the People's Army, must have a high level of culture and must have a strong physique. In order to move towards modernization, the People's Liberation Army must universally carry out cultural learning movements, sports movements, and literary and artistic movements. This conference should be such a mobilization meeting. From the specific content, because in addition to the literacy race and cultural test, all the sports athletes or performance programs participating in the conference are selected by the masses and brought to the entire army for competition. Through mass selection, the best things are brought up, which is the improvement on the basis of popularization. The reason why this conference has such excellent results is because both the sports athletes and the performance programs come from the masses, and in fact, only in this way can the combat-oriented mass cultural and sports activities that we advocate have a relatively solid foundation. After the competition of the conference, the selected winners have a demonstrative effect on the entire army and have a guiding role in the popularization of the entire army, which is to reverse the direction and guide the popularization with improvement. Comrades! After you return to your troops after participating in the conference, you must widely convey the spirit of the conference in the troops, so that commanders and combatants of the entire army pay more attention to cultural learning, sports, and literary and artistic work. From the literacy race and cultural test of the conference, we have seen the real progress of cultural learning in the troops, and we have seen that since the launch of the vigorous cultural learning movement in the troops, the cultural level is rapidly improving. The vast number of commanders and combatants know that learning culture is to build a modern national defense army, to defend the motherland, and to defend peace, so the learning mood is extremely high, the achievements are leaping forward, rapidly eliminating illiteracy, and improving the level of cultural and scientific knowledge. In the future, we should especially emphasize consolidation work, review more, read more, write more, and apply more, and further consolidate and gradually improve what we have learned through crash courses.

Sports should focus on popularization and should be universally developed. All troops and services should combine their own military training needs, select several sports projects, vigorously promote them, and comprehensively promote them. In addition to military sports, general sports should also be vigorously promoted to exercise the physical strength, agility, and flexibility of the troops. Sports in various troops should become a regular, continuously developing and continuously improving movement. We require the comrades of each representative team to consolidate and develop the enthusiasm and achievements of this participation in the conference after returning, and combine sports with learning and combat, and become an indispensable activity in daily life. Leading organs at all levels should especially pay attention to strengthening the work of clubs, so that sports in the troops can be organized, organized, and led more quickly, so as to better serve the construction of the troops.

In terms of literature and art, in the future, we should continue to implement the policy of "comprehensively developing the combat-oriented and mass-based cultural and artistic work of the People's Liberation Army." Literary and art workers must further solve the problems of "who is literature and art for" and "how to do it" ideologically. Whoever does not do this cannot go deep into the company, so there is no way to improve politically, ideologically, and artistically, and they cannot serve the soldiers well. It can be seen from the competition programs of this conference that as long as we go deep into the masses and go deep into life and struggle, we can reflect life and struggle, and reflect it very well. Whether it is singing or dancing, the competition programs have rich life content, lively emotions, and a vigorous fighting spirit, which not only soldiers love to watch, cadres love to watch, but also the masses outside the troops love to watch, because they all have the characteristics of combat and mass character. They are all for popularization, and they are also things that are improved on the basis of popularization. Of course, we still have many shortcomings. We believe that after this all-army competition, it will definitely have a huge impact on the literary and artistic work of the entire army, and the literary and artistic work of the entire army will be further advanced both ideologically and artistically.

Comrades! Finally, let me repeat again, this conference has been victorious, successful, and complete! However, our achievements are still far from enough, the development of cultural and sports activities in our troops is not balanced enough, not universal enough, and the level is not high enough. We must work harder. All comrades should continue to strengthen cultural learning, consolidate the achievements we have made, and move the cultural level of our troops further forward; the physical fitness of commanders and combatants must be greatly strengthened, and the policy of comprehensively developing the combat-oriented and mass-based cultural and artistic work of the People's Liberation Army must be implemented in the company. Sports athletes of various projects! Continue to intensify training, improve technology, create new and higher records, and lead the entire army to train themselves into an iron physique. Literary and art workers! Go deep into the company, create better works with ideological and artistic content, and serve the soldiers! All comrades work together to follow the direction indicated to us by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and strive to accelerate the construction of a regular and modern national defense army! Strive to oppose imperialist aggression, defend the motherland, and defend peace in the East and the world!

Celebrate the victory of the All-Army Sports Meet!

Long live the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Long live the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the creators and leaders of the Chinese People's Army!

Long live the People's Republic of China! (Xinhua News Agency)

    在“八一”建军节体育运动大会闭幕典礼上
    军委总政治部萧华副主任的评判总结各位来宾、各位同志、各代表队全体运动员、演员和代表同志们：
    庆祝中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年全军第一次盛大的、全面规模的体育运动大会胜利地召开，胜利地进行，今天就要胜利地闭幕了！
    我们的大会在人民革命军事委员会直接领导之下，在各部队各级首长的大力号召和积极支持之下，在北京市各机关团体特别是体育界许多同仁的全力帮助之下，在各代表队全体运动员、演员和代表同志们一致努力之下，我们这次大会开得很好，我们这个大会是一个胜利的、成功的大会！
    第一：我们的大会始终表现了高度的团结精神。这次大会在我军和在全国范围说来都是空前盛大的，竞赛项目包括军事体育、球类运动、田径、游泳、文艺、杂技等三十八种。表演项目也有航空体育、水上体育、马术、摩托车、团体操等二十余种之多。参加人数，除参加各种表演项目的运动员不计外，仅参加竞赛项目的运动员和文艺工作者即达三千五百余人。有的来自内地，有的来自边疆，还有来自朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军。就民族范围说，不光有汉族，还有华北内蒙的蒙古民族、新疆的维吾尔族、东北的朝鲜族等。代表中不光有众多的战斗员和中下级干部，还有师以上的高级干部。在整个大会过程中，自觉的建立了一种互相尊重、互相学习、互相帮助的崭新的作风，到处充满了亲密团结竞相进取的空气，发扬了我们人民解放军固有的优良的传统。
    第二：通过这次大会，检阅了我们部队战斗性、群众性的文化体育活动的强大力量，表现了我军革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义的精神。朱总司令在大会的开幕典礼上指示我们说：“今天，在建军二十五周年纪念节日，举行全军体育运动大会，我们的任务就是检阅部队关于文化教育、体育运动、军事技术和文艺活动的成绩，发扬优点，交流经验，以便有力地推进部队的训练。”大会遵照朱总司令的这
    一指示进行，说明自今年开始文化学习以来，在我们许多部队里，已经消除了文盲，我们部队的文化水平业已普遍地提高了。在体育运动和军事技术上，我们部队也大大向前跨进了一步。自去年全军篮排球比赛以来，我军篮排球运动业已显著提高。田径方面，大会女子四百公尺接力，西南军区成绩为五十四秒六；男子八百公尺接力，东北军区成绩为一分三十五秒七；女子八百公尺接力，西南军区成绩为一分五十五秒五；男子一千六百公尺接力，军事学院成绩为三分三十四秒五；女子跳远，空军成绩为五点零二公尺；这些纪录都打破了解放后全国各地的纪录水平。军事体育摩托车运动员表演“腾空超越”，更创造了十二公尺的新纪录。文艺竞赛评为一等的歌唱节目有“我是一个兵”、“歌唱二郎山”、“英雄的汽车司机员”、“蓄洪区说话”、“侦察英雄韩启发”；舞蹈节目评为一等的有“战士游戏舞”、“筑路舞”、“炮兵舞”、“坑道舞”、“轮机兵舞”；其他评为二等的歌舞还有十几个，三等的三十余个；得奖的有部队优秀的文艺工作者十余人。所有这些歌舞，不仅表现了各兵种丰富的斗争生活，而且充满了欢快的情绪、战斗的气氛，表现了我军的英雄气概和革命的乐观主义精神。值得提出的，如歌曲“炊事员四季调”，为志愿军某部炊事员张福生同志自编自唱；舞蹈“工兵舞”、“坦克兵舞”、“坑道舞”，均为战士集体创作。这些歌舞全都反映了他们丰富的生活和旺盛的战斗情绪，都充满了健康的自豪的胜利信心。各种杂技节目，也都充满了新的活泼愉快的情绪，技术精巧熟练，结合军事体育。同志们，我们以很短的时间，表现了如此丰富而众多的内容，并获得这样大的成绩，决不是一件简单的事情。这是我们在已有的优良传统的基础上，一致努力执行毛主席的指示，为建设正规化现代化国防军而奋斗的结果！是全军广大指挥员、战斗员在文化学习上坚决执行了军委决定的结果！这是广大指挥员、战斗员高度发扬了革命英雄主义的结果！这是各级领导和全体文艺工作者坚决执行军委总政治部开展战斗性群众性文艺运动，“面向连队、为兵服务”这一正确方针的结果！
    第三：这次大会始终贯彻了学习的精神。大家都知道，这次大会是为了推动部队文化学习，进一步开展部队体育文娱活动，使全体指挥员、战斗员具有高度的文化素养，并锻炼强壮的身体及勇敢、坚毅、机敏和集体主义的优良品质，为现代化国防军建设奠定坚强的基础。大会组织革命竞赛和规定胜负，无非因为这是推动学习和进步的最好的方式。因此，从集体主义的立场出发，发扬革命英雄主义，勤学勤练，争取优胜，并以之作为典型示范，普及到全军中去，这是完全必要的。这和旧社会中从个人出发的损人利己的锦标主义，是完全对立的两回事情。这次大会在各项比赛中，全体同志表现了胜利不骄傲，失败不气馁的优良品质。大家都能掌握批评与自我批评的精神，十分虚心地互相学习，并通过各种方式交流经验，发扬高度的进取心，为提高技术而继续不懈的努力。这是值得我们赞扬的。特别是全体运动员，一般的都树立了新的体育道德作风。同志们！你们之所以有这样好的表现，不仅仅是因为你们深刻领会了参加大会的直接目的是为了学习和进步，为了建设现代化的国防军，而且还因为我们的军队历来就是具有高度革命英雄主义精神的军队，我们必须发扬这种精神。
    第四：各代表队都发挥了服从组织、遵守纪律的集体主义精神。各代表队对大会所规定的制度，都能坚决执行，并执行得很好。参加大会的全体同志处处都表现了具有高度的组织纪律修养，保证了大会胜利地进行，并博得广大观众的同声赞扬。同志们！这是中国人民解放军的特色，也是我们大家值得引以自豪的。
    我们相信这次大会对部队文化体育运动一定能够负起更广泛更深入的动员、号召、示范与组织推动并深入普及下去的作用。我们中国人民，尤其是人民军队的广大指挥员、战斗员，必须有很高的文化，必须有坚强的体质。人民解放军为了走向现代化，必须普遍地开展文化学习运动、体育运动和文艺运动。这次大会应该是这样的一个动员大会。从具体的内容来说，因为除识字赛跑和文化测验外，所有参加大会的运动选手或演出节目，都是经过群众选拔，而拿到全军范围来竞赛竞演的。经过群众选拔，把最好的东西拿上来，这就是在普及基础上的提高。这次大会所以有这样优良的成绩，也就是因为无论是运动选手或演出节目都是从群众中来的，实际上也只有这样，我们所提倡的战斗性群众性的文化体育活动才能有比较巩固的基础。经过大会竞赛竞演，被选拔出来的优胜者就有对全军示范的作用，就有指导全军普及的作用，这就是反转来以提高指导普及。同志们！你们参加大会回去之后，要将大会的精神在部队中进行普遍的传达，使全军指挥员、战斗员对文化学习、体育运动、文艺工作引起更大的重视。从大会识字赛跑和文化测验中，使我们看到了部队文化学习的真实进度，看出了部队自展开轰轰烈烈的文化学习运动以来，文化水平正在迅速地提高。广大指挥员、战斗员都知道学习文化是为了建设现代化的国防军、为了保卫祖国、保卫和平，因而学习情绪无比的高涨，成绩飞跃地进步，迅速地消除着文盲，提高着文化科学知识的水平。今后应当特别强调巩固工作，要多复习，多看书，多写作，多应用，将突击学来的东西进一步巩固并逐步地提高起来。
    体育运动应该着重普及，应该普遍发展起来。各部队各兵种应该结合自己军事训练的需要，选择几种运动项目，大力提倡，全面推广。除军事体育外，一般体育也应该大力提倡，以锻炼部队体力和机敏灵活的效能。各部队体育运动应当成为经常的、不断发展不断提高的运动。我们要求各代表队的同志，回去之后，把这次参加大会比赛的热情和成绩巩固起来，发展起来，把体育运动和学习、战斗结合起来，成为日常生活不可缺少的活动。各级领导机关尤应经常注意加强俱乐部的工作，使部队体育运动较快地作到有制度、有组织、有领导，使之更好地为部队的建设服务。
    文艺方面今后仍应继续贯彻“全面发展人民解放军战斗性、群众性文化艺术工作”的方针。文艺工作者一定要从思想上进一步解决“文艺为谁”、“如何为法”的问题，谁不这样做谁就不能深入连队，因而政治上、思想上、艺术上就无从提高，也不能很好地为兵服务。从这次大会竞演节目可以看出，只要我们深入群众，深入生活和斗争，就能反映生活和斗争，而且反映得很好。竞赛节目无论歌唱、舞蹈都有了丰富的生活内容、生动活泼的情绪、旺盛的战斗精神，不但战士爱看，干部爱看，部队以外的群众也都爱看，因为他们都具备了战斗性、群众性的特点。都是为了普及的，同时也是在普及基础上加以提高的东西。当然，我们还有很多不够之处，我们相信经过这次全军竞演，一定会对全军文艺工作产生巨大的影响，把全军文艺工作无论是思想性和艺术性都会向前推进一步。
    同志们！最后让我重复地再说一遍，这次大会是胜利地圆满地成功了！但是，我们的成绩还很不够，我们部队的文化体育活动的发展还不够平衡，不够普遍，水平还不够高，我们还必须加倍地努力。全体同志应该继续加强文化学习，巩固既得成绩，将我们部队的文化水平再向前跨进一步；部队指挥员、战斗员的体质还要大大加强，把全面发展人民解放军战斗性、群众性的文化艺术工作的方针贯彻到连队中去。各种项目的体育运动员们！要继续加紧锻炼，提高技术，创造新的更高的纪录，并带动全军，把自己锻炼成为铁的体质。文艺工作者们！深入连队，创造更好的富有思想性和艺术性的作品，为兵服务！全体同志一致努力，遵循着毛主席和朱总司令给我们指示的方向，为加速正规化、现代化国防军的建设而奋斗！为反对帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国，保卫东方与世界和平而奋斗！
    庆祝全军体育运动大会的胜利！
    英雄的中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民军队的创造者和领导者伟大的中国共产党和毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！（新华社）
