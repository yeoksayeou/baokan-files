Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd: On the afternoon of August 2nd, from 4 PM to 7 PM, the U.S. side once again violated the agreement and shelled the Panmunjom armistice negotiation conference area. Our armistice negotiation delegation's chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, was ordered on August 3rd to lodge a protest with the other side, demanding that the other side take necessary measures to strictly abide by the agreement and prevent similar incidents from happening again. The full text of the protest letter is as follows: To Colonel McCaslin, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command Delegation:

	On the afternoon of August 2nd, 1952, from 4 PM to 7 PM, your ground troops violated the agreement and shelled the conference area. This matter has been jointly investigated by the security officers of both sides, and both human and material evidence prove that this incident was committed by your ground troops. It must be reminded to your side that after your shelling of the conference area on June 5th, 1952, at your suggestion, both sides re-measured the boundaries of the conference area and erected new markers. Therefore, your side has even less excuse to shirk responsibility for this violation of the agreement. I am ordered to protest to your side regarding this violation of the agreement and demand that your side take all necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

	Colonel Zhang Chunshan, Chief Liaison Officer of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation
	August 3rd, 1952
