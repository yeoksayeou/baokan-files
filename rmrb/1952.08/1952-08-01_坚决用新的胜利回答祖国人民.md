    Resolutely Use New Victories to Answer the People of the Motherland
    Hero of the Volunteer Army Air Force Zhang Jihui
    Since I shot down the American so-called "jet ace pilot" George A. Davis, people from factories, schools, government offices, troops, and rural areas all over the motherland have sent me more than six hundred letters, which makes me infinitely moved and inspired. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you!
    I read these letters during breaks in combat. When I read that the people of the motherland were cheering for the victory of our young Volunteer Army Air Force and expecting us to strike the American air pirates even harder, I deeply felt the glory and importance of the task undertaken by the air force soldiers standing on the front line against American aggression and defending world peace. All the children of the second grade of a primary school in Beijing sent me a notebook on the "June 1st" International Children's Day. In a letter signed with the names of the children, they said: "We don't know what to say or what gifts to send to thank the Volunteer Army Air Force uncles. With your and the Volunteer Army Infantry uncles' fighting, we can live happily in the motherland. We hope you shoot down more American bandit planes and record your combat deeds in this notebook, and read them to us when we meet in the future." I think this is not only the children's expectation of us but also the exhortation of the people of the motherland. Dear people of the motherland! We will certainly live up to your earnest expectations, and we must create greater victories to answer the people of the motherland.
    The support of the people of the motherland is an important source of strength for us to defeat the American air pirates. When I returned to the motherland last year and passed through Shandong, the workers at the station enthusiastically helped me when they knew I was a Volunteer Army Air Force soldier. When I thanked them, they asked: "Have those planes we donated arrived at the Korean front?" "Shandong alone has donated an air force division!" These words of the worker comrades have always been in my heart. After returning to the front, I told my comrades, and they all excitedly said to me: "We must use victory to answer the concern of the people of the motherland!" Since then, whenever I flew to the war zone in a plane donated by the people of the motherland, I seemed to feel the hearts of so many people of the motherland waiting for us to bring them news of victory. Therefore, we fought bravely and defeated the invading American air pirates.
    Once, I went to a city. The children of a cadre elementary school knew I was there, and they asked me to meet with them. As soon as I arrived, the innocent children with red scarves stretched out their little hands and pushed and pulled me into the campus. After I told them the story of how I shot down Davis, the children gave me their favorite things as gifts and tied red scarves around my neck. Some children held small notebooks and clamored for me to sign my name. The teachers and children said to me more than once: "With you protecting us, we can study with peace of mind."
    On the way back, I saw fields full of abundant crops outside the car, looked at the smoking factories in the distance, and recalled the children's exhortations to me. I thought: It is to allow the children to study quietly and grow up happily; to allow the people of the motherland to work happily in various positions for the beautiful tomorrow of the motherland; to defend the construction of the motherland and the happy life of the people; and to defend the lasting peace of the world, that we are steadfast in our combat posts, giving the enemy a heavy blow in the air.
    The American aggressors are still unreasonably delaying and attempting to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations. After carrying out inhumane germ warfare against Korea and within the borders of our country, they deliberately expanded their aggression, bombed the Yalu River power plant, and invaded our country's airspace, conducting strafing. The heinous crimes of American imperialism will be met with even heavier blows from the Chinese and Korean people.
    On the occasion of commemorating the 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day of the people of the motherland, the glorious history of the People's Liberation Army and its fine tradition of arduous struggle powerfully inspire us. I vow: I will follow the instructions of the people of the motherland, strive to improve my skills and tactics, strengthen my fighting will, and, together with my comrades, strike the American air pirates with a hundred times the courage, creating new victories for the motherland, for the Korean people, and for the lasting peace of the world, to answer the warm concern of the people of the motherland for us!

    坚决用新的胜利回答祖国人民
    志愿军空军英雄  张积慧
    我自从击毙了美国所谓“喷气机王牌驾驶员”乔治·A·戴维斯以后，祖国各地的工厂、学校机关、部队、农村中的人民先后寄给我六百多封信，这使我无限感动和激奋。我谨向你们致以衷心的感谢！
    我在战斗间隙，阅读了这些来信。当我读到祖国人民为我们年青的志愿军空军的胜利而欢呼，以及期望我们更沉重地打击美国空中强盗的时候，我深深感觉到站在反对美国侵略、保卫世界和平最前线的空军战士所担负的任务的光荣和重大。北京一个小学二年级的全体小朋友们在“六一”国际儿童节的时候给我寄来了一本笔记本。在签满了孩子们的名字的信上，他们说：“我们不知道说些什么话，送些什么礼物来感谢志愿军空军叔叔们。有了你们和志愿军步兵叔叔们的战斗，我们可以在祖国愉快地生活了。我们希望你多多打下美国强盗的飞机，把你的战斗事迹都记在这个本子上，将来见面的时候读给我们听。”我想，这不仅是孩子们对我们的期望，也是祖国人民的嘱咐。亲爱的祖国人民啊！我们一定不辜负你们的殷切期望，我们一定要创造更大的胜利来回答祖国人民。
    祖国人民的支援，是我们战胜美国空中强盗的重要力量源泉。我去年回到祖国路过山东的时候，在车站上工人们知道我是志愿军空军战士以后，立刻热情地帮助我。当我向他们致谢的时候，他们问起：“咱们捐献的那些飞机，都到了朝鲜前线没有？”“光咱们山东就捐了一个空军师哩！”工人同志们的这几句话，一直记在我的心中。回到前线以后，我告诉了我的战友们，他们都激动地和我说：“我们一定要用胜利来回答祖国人民的关怀！”此后，每当我驾驶着祖国人民捐献的飞机向战区飞去的时候，我就仿佛感到有多少祖国人民的心在盼望我们带给他们以胜利的消息。因此，我们就奋勇战斗，打败来犯的美国空中强盗。
    有一次，我到了一个城市。一个干部子弟小学的孩子们知道我在那里，他们要求我去和他们见面。在我刚一到达的时候，天真的、系着红领巾的孩子们就伸出小手，把我连推带拉地接到校园里去。我向他们讲完了我击毙戴维斯的故事以后，孩子们把自己最心爱的东西送给我做礼物，并在我的颈上系上了红领巾。有的孩子拿着小本子嚷着要我签名。老师和孩子们都不止一次地对我说：“有了你们在保卫我们，我们就能安心学习了。”
    归途中，我看见车外长满了丰盛庄稼的田野，望着远处冒烟的工厂，回想着孩子们对我的嘱咐，我想到：就是为了让孩子们能够安静地学习，幸福地成长；为了让祖国人民能够在各种岗位上为祖国美好的明天愉快地工作；为了保卫祖国的建设和人民的幸福生活；为了保卫世界的永久和平，我们才坚守在战斗的岗位上，在空中给敌人以沉重的打击。
    美国侵略者仍在无理拖延和企图破坏朝鲜的停战谈判。在对朝鲜和祖国境内施行了灭绝人性的细菌战后，又蓄意扩大侵略，轰炸鸭绿江发电厂，侵入我国领空，进行扫射。美帝国主义的滔天罪行，将遭到中朝人民更沉重的打击。
    当此纪念祖国人民的“八一”建军节二十五周年的时候，人民解放军的光荣历史，艰苦奋斗的优良传统，有力地鼓舞着我们。我宣誓：我要遵照祖国人民的嘱咐，努力提高技术、战术，加强战斗意志，和我的战友们一道，勇气百倍地打击美国空中强盗，为祖国、为朝鲜人民、为世界持久和平创造新的胜利，来回答祖国人民对我们的热烈关怀！
