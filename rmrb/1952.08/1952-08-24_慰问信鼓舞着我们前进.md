    Letter of Condolence Inspires Us to Move Forward
    Beloved people of the Motherland: When we were celebrating the 25th anniversary of the great "August 1st" Army Day, we were all indescribably happy to receive your letter of condolence to us. From your letter, we once again saw the new scene of the motherland's rapid progress as if we were there. Model figures such as Hao Jianxiu, Qi Jianhua, and Qu Yaoli, and their model deeds, have added infinite combat strength to us.
    The letters from the people of the Motherland have become an indispensable force to encourage us to move forward. It gives us the confidence to overcome difficulties when we encounter them, and the determination to eliminate pain when we encounter it. For example, in February and March of this year, the soldiers were building fortifications on the top of a mountain more than 800 meters high with several feet of snow. The soil was frozen harder than stone, and the shovel and hands were stuck together. The meals delivered by the cooks were often frozen. But when the cultural instructor came to the position to read us the letter of condolence from the motherland, it was like sending us a pot of fire, warming everyone's heart, and everyone felt particularly strong when they picked up the pickaxe.
    Currently, it is the rainy season in Korea, and sometimes clothes and quilts are all wet with rain, and we cannot get good rest at night. Our work, life, and combat have many difficulties; but we all feel that we have sufficient strength to overcome these difficulties, and one of the sources of this strength is the support of the people of the motherland!
    Dear compatriots of the motherland, please rest assured to produce, study, and work. The happiness of the people of the motherland is our happiness, and we have the obligation and responsibility to defend it. If anyone dares to destroy it, we will eliminate him!

    慰问信鼓舞着我们前进
    敬爱的祖国人民：在庆祝伟大的“八一”建军节二十五周年的时候，接到你们写给我们的慰问信，大家都有说不出来的愉快。从你们的来信中，我们又一次亲临其境似地看到祖国正在突飞猛进的新景象。郝建秀、祁建华、曲耀离等模范人物和他们的模范事迹，都给我们增添了无限的战斗力量。
    祖国人民的来信，已经成了鼓舞我们前进不可缺少的力量。它使我们在遇到困难时有信心去克服，碰到了痛苦时有决心去排除。比如，在今年二、三月里，战士们在高八百多公尺、积雪数尺的山顶上筑工事，土冻得比石头还硬，铁锹和手黏在一块，炊事员送来的饭，往往也结了冰。但当文化教员到阵地上给我们念祖国的慰问信时，就好像给我们送来了一盆火，温暖着每一个人的心，大家举起十字镐来，就显得特别有力量。
    目前，朝鲜正值雨季，有时衣服、被子全被雨水打湿，夜晚也不能得到很好的休息，我们的工作、生活和战斗有不少困难；但是我们都觉得有充分的力量来克服这些困难，这种力量的源泉之一，就是祖国人民在支援我们！
    亲爱的祖国同胞们，你们安心生产、学习、工作吧，祖国人民的幸福就是我们的幸福，我们有义务、有责任去保卫它。有人敢来破坏，我们就消灭他！　　　　　　　　　志愿军某部　谢国华
