	Basic Construction at Hebi Coal Mine Neglects Surveying and Drilling
	Wang Xue
	The basic construction project of Hebi Coal Mine, under the jurisdiction of the Department of Industry of Pingyuan Province, although approved by the North China Administrative Committee and the Central Fuel Industry Department, has resulted in significant losses due to blind design and construction without detailed geological surveys and drilling.
	Geological surveying and drilling are the most important foundations for coal mine basic construction. Although Hebi Coal Mine conducted some surveying and drilling work before the design phase, it was done very hastily, and drill hole locations were determined carelessly without thorough investigation. For example, the No. 1 drill hole reached coal at a depth of 101 meters. Based on this information, it was assumed that there was coal in the northern part of Hebiji, and drilling continued southeast of the No. 1 drill hole. When drilling the No. 2 drill hole, the location was determined solely by visual estimation, believing it to be 800 meters downhill from the No. 1 drill hole. However, upon measurement, it was found to be 1,300 meters away. As a result of this blind drilling, coal was not found even at a depth of 400 meters, and it was not determined whether there was a fault. Nevertheless, the mine continued to drill the No. 3, 4, and 5 drill holes. After drilling a total of five drill holes, it was discovered that the depth of the coal did not match the pre-calculated depth, with significant discrepancies in some cases. What was the reason for this? Some believed it was due to changes in terrain trends, while others suspected a fault. Without clarifying the cause, the drilling rig was moved to the southern area of Hebiji for drilling. Three drill holes were drilled in the southern area, and coal was discovered at a depth of just over 100 meters in each. Consequently, it was concluded that the terrain changes in the southern area were not as significant as in the northern area. At this point, further drilling was not continued to clarify the coal seam conditions and hydrological situation. The location of the mine was hastily moved from the No. 1 drill hole in the north to the south. Various designs were made based on this incomplete data. This design was highly speculative. Up to now, after more than two months of construction and spending over 8 billion yuan, the geological structure of the coalfield and the distribution of coal seams in the mining area have not been clarified. Such blind basic construction work will inevitably lead to adverse consequences. The current situation is already evident: two shafts under construction are flooding with 200 tons of water per day. Due to the lack of prior hydrological data and the absence of prepared generators and electric pumps, temporary leather bags are being used for drainage. As a result, drainage cannot be done during shaft sinking, and shaft sinking cannot be done during drainage, causing the shaft sinking project to progress very slowly, wasting manpower and financial resources. The Coal Mine General Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department should inspect this situation of blind basic construction work at Hebi Coal Mine and take effective measures to correct these errors.

    鹤壁煤矿基本建设忽视勘察和钻探工作
    王雪
    平原省工业厅所属鹤壁煤矿的基本建设工程，虽然经过华北行政委员会和中央燃料工业部的批准，但由于没有进行详细的地质勘察和钻探，就盲目地设计和施工，以致造成很大的损失。
    地质勘察和钻探是煤矿基本建设工作的最重要的根据。鹤壁煤矿在设计之前虽然也进行了一些勘察和钻探工作，但是作得非常草率，没有经过很好的勘察就草率地确定钻眼位置。比如一号钻眼钻了一百零一公尺深见了煤，于是就根据这个材料，认为鹤壁集北部有煤，便在一号钻眼东南部继续打钻眼。其中打二号钻眼时，又只凭眼力估计确定了位置，认为二号眼距一号眼下山八百公尺，结果一测量，相距一千三百公尺。由于盲目打眼的结果，打了四百公尺深仍没有发现煤，也没判断出有没有断层。但是，该矿又继续打第三、四、五号钻眼。一共打了五个钻眼，才发现煤的深度和预先计算见煤的深度不符合，有的相差很大。这是什么道理呢？有的人认为是地形走向变化，有的人认为是有断层。还没有弄清原因，就又把钻探机移到鹤壁集南部地区去钻探了。在南部地区又钻了三个眼，都在一百多公尺深的地方发现了煤。于是，大家就认为南部地形变化没有北部的变化大。这时，没有再继续钻探，弄清煤层情况和水文情况，就又草率地决定把矿井位置从北部一号眼的地方移到南部来。根据这些不完整的资料，就进行了各种设计。这种设计是带有很大的盲目性的。直到现在，已经施工两个多月，花了八十余亿元，但是，对矿区的煤田地质构造和煤层分布状况还是没有弄清楚。这样盲目地做基本建设工作，必将造成恶果。现在的情况已经很明显：有两个正在施工的井筒，每天涌水二百公吨。由于事先没有水文资料，没有准备好发电机和电泵，临时改用牛皮包排水。这样，排水就不能打井，打井就不能排水，使打井工程进展得非常缓慢，造成人力、财力的浪费。对于鹤壁煤矿这种盲目进行基本建设工作的情况，中央燃料工业部煤矿总局应加以检查，并采取有效措施纠正这些错误。
