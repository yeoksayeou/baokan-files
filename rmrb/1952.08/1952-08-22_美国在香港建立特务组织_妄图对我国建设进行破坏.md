Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: U.S. imperialism, in collaboration with Britain, is currently establishing an espionage organization in Hong Kong, attempting to undermine our country's construction efforts. According to a Rome dispatch from TASS: A "National Daily" correspondent in New York reported that Britain has agreed to the proposal made by U.S. Secretary of State Acheson for Britain and the U.S. to jointly conduct sabotage activities against China through the so-called China Refugee Relief Committee. The "China Refugee Relief Committee" is a special agent spy agency that the U.S. State Department is establishing in Hong Kong. The budget for the "Committee" is 10 million U.S. dollars, half of which is provided by the U.S. government under the "Mutual Security Act of 1951," and half by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The "Committee" will be under the command of Acheson, Marshall, and Wedemeyer. It is reported that the British government has issued instructions to the Governor of Hong Kong to assist the "Committee" in establishing a branch in Hong Kong and to cooperate with the American representatives of the "Committee" already in Hong Kong.

    “委员会”将受艾奇逊、马歇尔和魏德迈指挥。据悉：英国政府已对香港总督发出训令，要他协助该
