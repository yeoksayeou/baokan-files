Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 25th: Tan Jingmin, one of our captured personnel who was forced by the U.S. side to act as a special agent and airdropped into our rear, exposed another crime committed by the U.S. side: the massacre of prisoners of war.

Tan Jingmin was originally in the 72nd Regiment of the U.S. POW camp, with detention number 709999. Last August, he was sent to Busan for "review," which was actually the U.S. side coercing him for intelligence. He was imprisoned in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, and his tent was separated from the camp where the People's Army prisoners of war were held by only a barbed wire fence. On the evening of August 15th, many male and female prisoners of war of the People's Army gathered in the camp to celebrate the anniversary of the liberation of Korea. They sang revolutionary songs and danced folk dances. At this moment, the U.S. and Syngman Rhee bandits savagely swept the crowd with machine guns. Many prisoners of war fell to the ground in response. Many male prisoners of war covered the female prisoners of war with their bodies, still singing loudly. Many prisoners of war, wounded and fallen to the ground, still bravely shouted slogans. In this massacre, eight male prisoners of war and seven female prisoners of war were killed on the spot, and more than forty prisoners of war were wounded.

Even now, the U.S. side has never made any responsible explanation to our side for the many massacre incidents they have been forced to disclose, not to mention the countless shocking and bloody crimes that are still unknown to this day. Until the U.S. side clearly explains all these bloody massacres, both disclosed and undisclosed, Truman has no right whatsoever to talk about "humanitarian and moral principles" towards prisoners of war.

### 我被俘人员揭发美方又一件屠杀战俘罪行

    我被俘人员揭发美方又一件屠杀战俘罪行
    【新华社开城二十五日电】被美方强迫充当特务空降到我方后方来的我方被俘人员谭镜民，揭发了又一件美方屠杀战俘的罪行。
    谭镜民原在美方战俘营第七十二联队，拘留编号是七零九九九九。去年八月，他被押到釜山去受“审查”，实际上就是美方对他逼供情报。他被关禁在美方俘虏收容所内，他住的帐幕与囚禁人民军战俘的营场只隔一道铁丝网。八月十五日晚上，许多人民军的男女战俘聚集在营场上，庆祝朝鲜解放纪念日。他们高唱着革命歌曲，跳着家乡的舞蹈。正在这时，美李匪军竟用机枪野蛮地向人群横扫。很多战俘应声倒地。许多男的战俘用身子掩住了女的战俘，仍然高声唱着歌。许多战俘负伤倒地后，仍然壮烈地高呼口号。在这次屠杀中，有八个男战俘和七个女战俘当场牺牲，四十多名战俘被打伤。
    一直到现在，美方甚至对于他们已经被迫透露的多次屠杀事件，都从未对我方作任何负责的交代，更不用说那无数次迄今尚未为人所知的骇人听闻的血腥罪行了。在美方对所有这些已经透露和未曾透露过的血腥屠杀明白交代之前，杜鲁门就没有丝毫权利谈什么对战俘的“人道与道德原则”。
