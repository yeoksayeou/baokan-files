Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: The music and dance performance of the Czechoslovak "Vít Nejedlý Army Art Troupe," sponsored by the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission, officially opened on the evening of the 12th at the Experimental Theater of the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing.

Among those attending the opening ceremony were Chen Yi, Minister of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Military Commission, senior cadres of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, literary and artistic workers from various units, literary and artistic workers from the Chinese People's Volunteers participating in the "August 1st" sports meet, and literary and artistic figures from the capital, including Guang Weiran, Zhang Geng, Ma Ke, Tian Fang, Wang Yang, Yuan Shuipai, Wu Xiaobang, Dai Ailian, and the famous Korean dancer Choi Seung-hee, totaling more than 1,200 people. Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Kousal, and embassy staff were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

The opening ceremony began with the music of the national anthems of China, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union. First, Chen Yi delivered an opening speech, in which, in addition to celebrating the success of the Czechoslovak "Vít Nejedlý Army Art Troupe's" performance in China, he emphasized: "The Chinese people and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will welcome the performance of the 'Vít Nejedlý Army Art Troupe' in China with great enthusiasm. Their performance will not only strengthen the fighting friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia but will also be a contribution to the cause of defending world peace." Jaroslav Veselý, head of the "Vít Nejedlý Army Art Troupe," said in his reply that they would express their gratitude for the great and profound friendship of the Chinese people with their music and dance performances.

The opening ceremony proceeded in a warm and joyful atmosphere. Literary and artistic workers from various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army presented flowers and flags to the "Vít Nejedlý Art Troupe" to pay their respects.

Then, all the members of the "Vít Nejedlý Army Art Troupe" began a wonderful performance of music and dance. Every program performed received an extremely warm welcome from the audience. The performance did not end until late at night.

The "Vít Nejedlý Army Art Troupe" has brought more than fifty programs to China this time, divided into four parts: chorus, dance, solo, and orchestra. The main part of these programs is the heroic fighting spirit of the Czechoslovak people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Gottwald in opposing fascism and liberating their motherland. Such as the chorus "Forward for Gottwald," "Our Commander-in-Chief," "The Song of Julius Fučík," "Glory Belongs to the Army," the dance "Paratrooper Dance," and the orchestra's "Victory is Ours (March)," "People's Symphony" are all relatively excellent works in this regard. A large part of the art troupe's performance programs depict the unbreakable friendship between the Czechoslovak people and the Soviet people, and the Czechoslovak people's internationalism and determination to defend world peace. Among them, the dance "Friendship Dance of Czech and Soviet Armies" uses various national forms of dance to express the love of the Czechoslovak military and civilians for the Soviet army and is a very distinctive work. "Get Out of Korea!" and "We Fight for Peace" are songs created by Czechoslovak artists to oppose the aggressive acts of American imperialists and have become widely popular. A portion of the programs performed by the art troupe fully demonstrate the beautiful national artistic traditions of Czechoslovakia and the heroic and optimistic spirit of the Czechoslovak people. Works in this area include the dance "Sword Dance," "Moravian Folk Dance," the songs "Flowering Days," "Singing Black Mountain," "Don't Be Afraid, Children," "Dance!" and so on. The programs performed by the art troupe also include famous Chinese songs such as "The East is Red" and "The Battle Song of the Chinese People's Volunteers."
