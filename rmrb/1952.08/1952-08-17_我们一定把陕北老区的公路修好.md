    We Must Build the Roads in the Old Shaanxi-Gansu Border Region Well
    Xu Wenbo
    The Xian-Songjia River Highway, running north from Xianyang through Tongchuan and Yan'an to Songjia River, is the main transportation artery traversing the Shaanxi-Gansu plateau.

    This highway is the lifeline of the economic life of the people in the old liberated areas of northern Shaanxi. The abundant petroleum, fur products, and various agricultural products from the plateau are transported out from here; fabrics, daily necessities, and other goods transported from the Longhai Railway are transported to northern Shaanxi from here. It is of great significance for developing industrial and agricultural production and improving people's lives in northern Shaanxi.

    Since the Government Administration Council issued instructions on January 28 this year, calling for strengthening the economic construction of the old revolutionary base areas, the Xian-Songjia River Highway Engineering Bureau, under the leadership of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Transportation Department and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, has been planning the repair and renovation of this highway. The plan is to focus on rebuilding 273 kilometers from Tongchuan to Yan'an this year, including rebuilding bridges, culverts, and rebuilding 67 kilometers of roadbed. Preparations for construction began in April this year, and construction began simultaneously in nine sections in early May.

    The people of northern Shaanxi welcomed this project with excitement, and more than 7,000 workers participated in the repair and renovation work. The highway project is quite arduous. North of Tongchuan, it enters a plateau with an altitude of 800 to 1,000 meters. The Qiaoshan, Hengshan, and Liangshan branches of the Liupan Mountains wind through the territory, and the highway meanders between these mountains and the Yan River and Luo River. Most of the workers are artisans from cities and laborers from rural areas in various parts of Shaanxi. They lack road construction experience, but they actively responded to the call to "strengthen the economic construction of the old revolutionary base areas." In the course of their work, their political awareness and work efficiency improved as the project progressed. Two months after the start of construction, the work efficiency of the entire line generally reached the quota standard, and some work areas even exceeded the quota. Starting in June, a patriotic labor emulation campaign was launched, and work efficiency continued to improve. For example, two-thirds of the workers in the fourth section participated in the competition, and their earthwork efficiency averaged 6 cubic meters, exceeding the quota by 50 percent. The workers of the third detachment of the first section challenged the workers of the entire line, guaranteeing that they would exceed the quota in various tasks such as hard rock, soft rock, intermittent soil, and ordinary soil. In addition to meeting the standards for project quality, they also guaranteed to complete the project 33 days ahead of the original contract. In the competition, the workers put forward the slogans: "Turn the construction site into a battlefield!" "Earthwork is like American imperialism, let it collapse quickly in front of the workers!" Many touching stories emerged during the work. Some workers said: We must learn from the spirit of the volunteer soldiers fighting the enemy on the Korean battlefield to do our work, and not leave the work with minor injuries or ask for leave with minor illnesses. Fang Laixi, a technician from the first section, injured his foot during work and was persuaded to rest only after repeated urging. Wang Dianhua, an ordinary worker, lost half of his fingernail. He was afraid that people would know and persuade him to rest, so he concealed it from others.

    Many workers enthusiastically thought of ways and tricks to improve work efficiency and learned new working methods. When digging the roadbed, the fifth group of the fourth section had to transport soil through a high ground. They first dug three trenches on the road to transport the soil, so that they did not have to go uphill and downhill when transporting the soil, shortening the transportation distance. Zhu Xiaowu and others in the fifth section organized themselves scientifically to divide the work of digging and transporting soil, and their work efficiency exceeded the quota by one time. The "Construction Site Newsletter" published by the Political Department of the Engineering Bureau introduced advanced experiences from various places, and many workers enthusiastically studied them. The Li Tai'an group of the first section learned the advanced working methods of Yan Shaogui in Chengdu-Chongqing Railway for punching cannon holes, which doubled the work efficiency.

    Many workers showed the noble quality of loving the property of the motherland in their work. Meng Qingfu, an ordinary worker in the second section, discovered in the heavy rain that a section of the newly paved roadbed would be washed away by the water, so he ran in the rain to fetch a hoe and dredge a 20-meter-long ditch nearby to divert the flood and protect the roadbed. Zhang Shengxiu, a worker at the Huangqiao construction site, slept in the work shed at night and got up at any time to check the materials at the bridgehead; during the heavy rain, he automatically tightened the bridge column support and fastened the low-lying pedals to the bridge protection piles to prevent them from being washed away by the water. He often got soaked all over, but he still did not stop working.

    Many workers on the construction site missed the volunteer soldiers on the front lines in Korea. On the day the Wang Junlin group, a mountain opener from the first squadron of the sixth section, received their bonus wages, they excitedly took out 66,000 yuan and asked to transfer it to Korea to comfort the volunteer soldiers. Some workers asked to do part of the voluntary work and asked to support the front line with their bonus wages.

    The people of the old revolutionary base areas in northern Shaanxi gave great care and love to the workers in the road construction and helped them solve many difficulties. For example, a large number of workers suddenly increased on both sides of the highway, and food and lodging became a problem, especially in June and July, when it rained heavily for days, and some of the workers' cave dwellings collapsed, and some of the tents they built themselves leaked. Sometimes the road was rotten and food could not be transported. After the local people knew about it, they always enthusiastically helped to solve the problem. The people near the Jin Suoguan Bridge construction site gave up their own cave dwellings for the workers to live in, so that more than 200 workers safely spent the rainy season. The workers in the second section ran out of food during the rainy season, and Han Yuande (a communist party member), a vendor selling pancakes, was willing to stop his business and lent the workers five dou of wheat; the local people also sent 13,800 jin of food one after another. Some people drove livestock from seventy or eighty miles away to lend food to the workers. Nearby households were grinding flour for the workers overnight. Zhang Xiuzhu, a labor model, said when she sent wheat: "Chairman Mao suffered in northern Shaanxi for more than ten years for us. Now that he is in Beijing, he still cares about our construction here. We must do everything possible to support the worker brothers." The cooperative in Yijun County mobilized women to make shoes for the workers. The women's labor model in Ganquan organized women to sew and wash clothes, sprout soybeans, and make tofu for the workers. The workers said: "The folks care about us so much, we must build the road well and complete it ahead of schedule to repay the kindness of the folks!"

    Now, the entire road has proposed to strive to complete this year's entire project in October; and in response to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice economy, it has formulated a plan to save the country 10 billion yuan in wealth.

    我们一定把陕北老区的公路修好
    徐文波
    南起咸阳，北经铜川、延安到宋家川的咸宋公路，是纵贯陕北高原的主干交通线。
    这条公路是关系陕北老解放区人民经济生活的动脉。高原上丰富的石油、皮货和各种农产品等由这儿运出去；从陇海铁路运来的布匹、日用品等由这儿运到陕北。它对发展陕北的工农业生产、改善人民生活都有很大的意义。
    自从今年一月二十八日政务院发布指示，号召加强老根据地的经济建设以后，咸宋公路工程局在西北军政委员会交通部和陕西省人民政府的领导下，便筹划这条公路的修整工作。计划在今年重点改建铜川到延安的二百七十三公里，包括改建桥梁、涵洞和改建路基六十七公里。今年四月起筹备动工，五月初即分九个工段同时开工。
    陕北人民以兴奋的心情迎接这一工程，七千多工人参加了修整工作。公路的工程是相当艰巨的。从铜川以北，即进入拔海八百到一千公尺的高原，六盘山的支脉桥山、横山、梁山蟠结境内，公路蜿蜒在这些山脉和延水、洛水之间。工人大多数是来自陕西各地城市中的手工业者和农村中的劳动人民，他们缺乏修路经验，但他们积极响应“加强革命老根据地经济建设”的号召。在工作中间，他们的政治觉悟和工作效率随着工程的进展而提高。开工后两个月，全路的工作效率就普遍达到了定额标准，部分工区并超过了定额。六月份起，又展开了爱国主义的劳动竞赛运动，工作效率继续得到提高。例如第四段的工人有三分之二参加了竞赛，他们的土方工作效率平均达到六公方，超过定额百分之五十。第一段第三分队的工人向全线工人挑战，保证在坚石、软石、间隔土、普通土的各种工作中，都要超过定额，除了工程质量要符合标准外，并按原订合同提前三十三天完工。在竞赛中工人们提出口号：“把工地变成战场！”“土方好比美帝国主义，让它在工人面前迅速崩溃！”工作中出现了许多感动人的事例。有的工人说：要学习志愿军在朝鲜战场上杀敌的精神来做工作，轻伤不下工，轻病不请假。第一段技工方来喜在工作中碰伤了脚，经再三说服才去休息。普通工王殿华手指甲碰掉了半个，他怕人家知道了劝他休息，就瞒着不告诉别人。
    许多工人热心地想办法、找窍门来提高工作效率，并学习新的工作方法。第四段第五组工人在挖路基时，运土要通过一个高地，他们就先在运土的路上挖三个壕，使运土时不要上坡下坡，缩短了运输距离。第五段朱效武等四人自己用科学的方法组织起来分工挖土、运土，工作效率超过定额一倍。工程局政治处出版的“工地通讯”介绍了各地的先进经验，许多工人就热烈学习。第一段的李太安小组学习成渝铁路颜绍贵冲炮眼的先进工作方法，使工作效率提高了一倍多。
    许多工人在工作中表现了热爱祖国财产的高贵品质。第二段的普通工孟庆福在大雨中发现一段新铺的路基将会被水冲垮，就冒雨跑去取鈌锄，疏通附近一条二十公尺长的水沟，把山洪引开，保护了路基。黄桥工地的工人张生秀，夜晚睡在工棚里，随时起来检查桥头的材料；在大雨期间，他自动去把桥柱支架木扣紧，并把低处的踏板系牢在护桥桩上，以免被水冲走。他常常全身淋得透湿，仍不停止工作。
    许多工人在工地上怀念着在朝鲜前线的志愿军。第六段一中队的开山工王君林小组，在拿到超额工资的那一天，兴奋地拿出六万六千元来，要求转送朝鲜慰问志愿军。有的工人要求做一部分义务工、要求以超额工资来支援前线。
    陕北革命老根据地的人民对修路中的工人给予极大的关心和爱护，帮助工人解决了不少困难。比如，公路两旁突然增加大批工人，食宿都成问题，尤其在六、七月间，大雨连绵，工人住的窑洞有的垮了，自己搭的篷帐也有的漏雨，有时路烂了运不来粮食，当地人民知道之后，总是热心帮助解决。金锁关桥工处附近的人民，纷纷把自己住的窑挤出来给工人住，使两百多工人安全地度过了雨季。第二段工人在雨季里把粮食吃光了，当地卖大饼的小贩韩元德（共产党员）情愿停止自己的生意，把五斗麦子借给工人；当地群众也先后送来粮食一万三千八百斤。有的人从七八十里外赶着牲口把粮食送来借给工人。附近家家户户为工人漏夜磨面。劳动模范张秀珠送来小麦时说：“毛主席为咱们在陕北受了十几年苦，现在到了北京还这样关心咱们这儿的建设，咱们一定尽一切力量支援工人兄弟们。”宜君县的合作社发动妇女做鞋供应工人。甘泉的妇女劳动模范组织妇女给工人缝洗衣服、生豆芽、做豆腐。工人们说：“老乡对咱们太关心了，咱们一定把路修得好好的，并提前完工，来报答老乡的好意！”
    现在，全路提出，要争取在十月完成今年的全部工程；并响应毛主席增产节约的号召，订出了为国家节省财富一百亿元的计划。
