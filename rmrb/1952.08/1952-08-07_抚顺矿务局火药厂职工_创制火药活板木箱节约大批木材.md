    Fushun Mining Bureau Explosives Factory Workers
    Invent Hinged Wooden Explosives Box, Saving Large Quantities of Timber
    Editor: The entire staff of the Fushun Mining Bureau Explosives Factory in Northeast China, responding to the State Council's call for saving timber, successfully trial-produced hinged wooden explosives boxes.
    The hinged wooden explosives box is a container for explosives. The manufacturing method follows the dimensions of a fixed wooden box, with the side panels, top and bottom edges, and front and rear edges of the top and bottom panels extended by 25 mm or 30 mm. Wooden strips of 25 mm or 30 mm width (their length matching the length of the wooden panel) are nailed onto each edge. The top cover is made into an inclined board with a three-degree angle and a fold. When the six wooden panels – top, bottom, left, right, front, and back – are assembled, they form a hinged wooden box. This type of hinged wooden box is more durable than the fixed wooden box, easier to disassemble, and the volume of the disassembled empty box is half that of the fixed wooden box, saving on transportation costs and facilitating recovery. In this way, one hinged wooden box can replace four fixed wooden boxes. By adopting this method, the Fushun Mining Bureau Explosives Factory alone can save 2,000 cubic meters of timber per year. If hinged wooden explosives boxes are used nationwide, even more timber can be saved for the country.   Hu Cunlin

    抚顺矿务局火药厂职工
    创制火药活板木箱节约大批木材
    编辑同志：东北抚顺矿务局火药厂全体职工，在响应政务院节约木材的号召下，试制火药活板木箱成功。
    火药活板木箱是盛装火药的箱子，制造方法是按照死板木箱的尺寸，在侧板上下两边，边板的左右两边，上盖与底板的前后两边，都加长二十五粍或三十粍宽，并在各个边上，钉上二十五粍或三十粍宽的木条（其长度与木板齐），在上盖上做成具有三度角的有折口的斜板，这样上、下、左、右、前、后六个木板安装在一起就成为一个活板木箱。这种活板木箱比死板木箱坚固耐用，易于拆开，拆下来的空箱体积为死板木箱空箱体积的一半，节省运费，便于收回，这样，一个活板木箱就能顶四个死板木箱使用。采用这个办法后，仅抚顺矿务局火药厂一年就可节省二千立方公尺木材。如果全国都使用火药活板木箱，将能为国家节约更多的木材。   胡存琳
