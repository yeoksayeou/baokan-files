    Based on Changes in Raw Cotton Composition and Other Production Conditions
    Hao Jianxiu Group Revises Challenge Conditions for Fine Yarn Workers
    The Hao Jianxiu Group of Qingdao State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 recently revised the competition conditions for challenging fine yarn workers nationwide, based on changes in the current raw cotton composition and other production conditions. Since June, the output and quality of yarn in Qingdao's cotton textile factories have been directly affected by objective conditions due to the use of lower-grade raw cotton and changes in the weather after the start of summer. To this end, with the help of the factory's administration and trade union, the Hao Jianxiu Group has revised the challenge conditions. The revised challenge conditions are as follows:
    (1) Implement the Hao Jianxiu work method measurement standards, with the group's average score reaching 97 points (the original challenge condition was 96 points); an average of 600 spindles watched per person; a top roller lapping rate of no more than 0.635% (the original challenge condition was 0.33%); reduce fuzzy yarn and ensure the quality of fine yarn.
    (2) Ensure that the group's production efficiency reaches 98%. The speed of the front roller averages 212 revolutions per minute; the output per spindle of 23-count yarn reaches 0.474 pounds per ten hours (the original challenge condition was 0.52 pounds).
    (3) The group's attendance rate reaches 95% or more.
    In order to ensure the smooth completion of the challenge conditions, the Hao Jianxiu Group has also formulated specific methods for completing the competition conditions, addressing the current problems in production. Their main methods are:
    (1) Actively learn from Hao Jianxiu's creative spirit, boldly experiment with and adopt various advanced labor organizations, and strengthen unity and mutual assistance within the group.
    (2) Overcome conservative thinking, strictly implement the Hao Jianxiu work method's patrol route, and conscientiously ensure that people control the machines. Learn from the advanced experience of Chen Shulan's group in doffing and stopping the machine in 15 seconds, and conscientiously improve the doffing work method in light of the specific conditions of the factory.
    (3) Ensure that the group and individuals do a good job of increasing production and practicing economy, and resolutely oppose false and wasteful phenomena. And prepare the following for the implementation of economic accounting: (1) Ensure that the administration is assisted in conscientiously carrying out regular inventory work, and quickly and accurately statistics and reports the quantity of finished and semi-finished products; (2) Ensure that records are kept of individual product quality, savings, and production increases; (3) Experiment with establishing a group weighing system.
    (4) Grasp the key issues in production, use your brains to find tricks, and constantly put forward rationalization proposals.
    (5) The whole group guarantees to improve their ideological level in the political study of communism and the Communist Party, and regularly check and improve their work with Hao Jianxiu's work attitude as the standard.
    (6) Do a good job in patriotic health work, reduce disease, and ensure good health.
    Office of the All-China Textile Workers' Union National Committee: The Hao Jianxiu Group's competition conditions should have been revised in mid-June based on changes in cotton blending composition and other production conditions, but at that time, because the administrative department's production plan had not been revised, the group's competition conditions could not be revised either. Now the factory director and deputy factory director of Qingdao State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 have reviewed this and, together with the trade union, have helped the Hao Jianxiu Group revise the competition conditions from the actual situation in terms of current raw cotton and production conditions. We believe that this approach is correct. Only by revising the competition conditions in a timely manner can the Hao Jianxiu Group's competition truly be practical and have a clear goal, can the competition results be correctly summarized and the enthusiasm of the masses be consolidated, and can the movement be carried out more deeply. The competition conditions revised by the Hao Jianxiu Group may seem to have been lowered on the surface, but according to the current actual situation and the existing foundation of the Hao Jianxiu Group, they have been improved by one step. The spirit of the entire competition conditions is centered on promoting advanced experience, launching rationalization proposals, improving labor organization, improving management systems, and implementing production reforms. Starting from these aspects to save raw materials, improve quality, reduce costs, and thereby complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy, and preventing the bias of blindly pursuing figures, is of great significance for further organizing Hao Jianxiu Group competitions in various places. Textile union organizations at all levels should carefully study the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Group's competition conditions, and, according to the specific conditions of their localities, more widely and deeply carry out the patriotic production increase and frugality movement in the textile system through the Hao Jianxiu Group competition.

    根据原棉成份和其他生产条件的变化
    郝建秀小组修订向细纱工人挑战的条件
    青岛国棉六厂郝建秀小组根据目前原棉成份及其他生产条件的变化，最近修订了向全国细纱工人挑战的竞赛条件。六月份以来，青岛各棉纺织厂因用品级较次的原棉，加以入夏后气候的变化，纱的产量和质量直接受到了客观条件的影响。为此，郝建秀小组在厂的行政和工会的帮助下，重新修订了挑战条件。修订后的挑战条件如下：
    （一）贯彻郝建秀工作法测定标准，全组分数平均达到九十七分（原来的挑战条件是九十六分）；平均每人看锭六百枚；皮辊花率不超过百分之零点六三五（原来的挑战条件是百分之零点三三）；减少羽毛纱，保证细纱质量。
    （二）全组生产效率保证达到百分之九十八。前罗拉的速度每分钟平均达到二百一十二转；二十三支纱每十小时每锭产量达到零点四七四磅（原来的挑战条件是零点五二磅）。
    （三）全组出勤率达到百分之九十五以上。
    为了保证挑战条件的顺利完成，郝建秀小组还针对目前生产中存在的问题，制定了完成竞赛条件的具体办法，他们的主要办法是：
    （一）积极学习郝建秀的创造精神，大胆试验和采用各种先进的劳动组织，加强全组的团结互助。
    （二）克服保守思想，严格执行郝建秀工作法的巡回路线，认真作到人掌握机器。学习陈树兰小组落纱停车十五秒的先进经验，结合本厂具体条件，认真改进落纱工作法。
    （三）保证作好小组及个人增产节约单的工作，坚决反对虚假和浪费现象。并为实行经济核算制作好以下准备工作：（1）保证协助行政认真作好经常的盘存工作，迅速而正确地统计和报告成品和半成品的数量；（2）保证作好个人产品质量、节约和增产的成绩纪录；（3）试验建立小组过磅制度。
    （四）抓住生产中的关键问题，开动脑筋找窍门，经常提出合理化建议。
    （五）全组保证在共产主义和共产党的政治学习中，提高思想水平，经常以郝建秀的劳动态度为标准检查和改进自己的工作。
    （六）作好爱国卫生工作，减少疾病，保证身体健康。
    中国纺织工会全国委员会办公室按：郝建秀小组的竞赛条件，在六月中旬就应该根据混棉成份及其他生产条件的变化加以修订，但当时因为行政方面的生产计划没有修改，因而使小组竞赛条件也无从修订。现在青岛国棉六厂的厂长和副厂长已对此作了检讨，并与工会一起帮助郝建秀小组按照目前原棉情况和生产情况，从实际出发修订了竞赛条件。我们认为这样作法是正确的，只有适时地修订竞赛条件，才能使郝建秀小组竞赛真正切合实际并有明确的奋斗目标，才能正确地总结竞赛成绩和巩固群众的热情，使运动更加深入地开展起来。郝建秀小组修改以后的竞赛条件，从表面上看来是降低了，但按照当前的实际情况和郝建秀小组的现有基础，却是提高了一步的。整个竞赛条件的精神都是以推广先进经验、开展合理化建议、改善劳动组织、改进管理制度和贯彻生产改革为中心内容。从这些方面入手来节约原材料，提高质量，降低成本，并从而完成增产节约任务，防止盲目追求数字的偏向，这对各地进一步组织郝建秀小组竞赛有很大意义。纺织工会各级组织应很好地研究郝建秀小组这一竞赛条件的精神，根据本地的具体情况，更加广泛、深入地通过郝建秀小组竞赛，把纺织系统中的爱国增产节约运动全面地开展起来。    （新华社）
