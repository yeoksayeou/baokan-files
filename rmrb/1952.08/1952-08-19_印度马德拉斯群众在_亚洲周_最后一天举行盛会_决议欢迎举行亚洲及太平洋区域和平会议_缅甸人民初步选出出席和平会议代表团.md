Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 18th: On the last day of the "Asia Week" held by the Indian people (August 10th), the Madras Peace Committee held a mass meeting at the Triplicane Beach in Madras City, which was enthusiastically attended by the masses.

The chairman of the meeting, Subrahmanyam, a famous South Indian film director, said at the meeting that the peace movement is a broad people's movement, and people from all walks of life, regardless of party affiliation or religious belief, should participate in this movement. He recounted his visit to the Soviet Union. He said that he was deeply moved by the Soviet people's desire to safeguard world peace. He called on the Indian people to strengthen the peace movement and unite to fight for the defense of Asian and world peace.

Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, said at the meeting that war anywhere in the world means disaster for the people of the whole world. He said that the reason why wars occur in Asia and Africa is that vested interest groups in one country pursue aggressive policies, trying to rule another country and exploit the people of another country. The British imperialist group is suppressing the national liberation movement of the Malayan people, the French vested interest group is attacking the Vietnamese people, and the US monopoly capital group is launching the most brutal war in Korea.

Duraikannu, the editor of a Tamil magazine, said that the culprits who launched wars in Korea and elsewhere were the imperialists. The Indian people have a responsibility to play an important role in the struggle to maintain peace. Referring to the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and the Third All-India Peace Congress scheduled to be held in Jullundur, East Punjab Province, in September, he said that the people of Madras should send representatives to these two peace conferences to support the cause of world peace.

Representatives of the All-India Students' Federation, Gayadevan and Rao, also delivered speeches at the meeting.

The meeting passed two resolutions, one of which stated: "This meeting of citizens of Madras welcomes the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference."

Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: Rangoon News: The people of Burma are actively carrying out preparations to welcome the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and the national peace movement has been further developed with the launch of preparations.

The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace has decided to form a delegation to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing this September. In order to make the delegation more broadly representative, including representatives from various states, regions, all classes, people's organizations, the literary and art circles, and Buddhists, Burmese peace activists have specially formed three groups to carry out various preparatory work. The representatives have now been preliminarily selected.

At the same time, the signature campaign initiated by the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace on July 10th, calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact and opposing the rearmament of Japan and a one-sided peace treaty with Japan, is actively underway throughout Burma. In the three days from July 10th to 12th, 2,279 citizens signed in the Rangoon markets. In the Pegu County in southern Burma, 5,000 people signed from July 10th to 19th. On the 19th, the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace held a county-wide peace congress in Pegu County. At the meeting, U Tun Aung Gyaw, Vice Chairman of the Committee, reported on the crimes of US imperialism in carrying out bacteriological warfare, and U Mya Myint, the Burmese representative who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, reported on the situation of the preparatory meeting and the tasks and goals of the Peace Conference.

Another Burmese representative, U Aye Chi, who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, is actively preparing to publish the English bi-monthly "Struggle for Peace" with writer Ba Moe Tin Aung in order to strengthen international peace relations and introduce the Burmese people's peace struggle to the people of all countries. The inaugural issue will be published before the opening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The content of the publication will fully reflect the Burmese people's enthusiastic support for the Peace Conference.

    印度马德拉斯群众在“亚洲周”最后一天举行盛会
    决议欢迎举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    缅甸人民初步选出出席和平会议代表团
    【新华社新德里十八日电】在印度人民举行的“亚洲周”的最后一天（八月十日），马德拉斯和平委员会在马德拉斯市的垂普里坎海湾举行了一次群众大会，到会的群众十分踊跃。
    大会主席、南印著名电影导演苏布拉曼雅姆在会上说：和平运动是广泛的人民运动，各阶层人民，不分党派和宗教信仰，都应该参加这个运动。他追述了他访问苏联的情形。他说，他深为苏联人民维护世界和平的热望所感动。他号召印度人民加强和平运动，团结起来为保卫亚洲及世界和平而斗争。
    印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士在会上说：世界上任何地方的战争都意味着全世界人民的灾难。他说，亚洲和非洲境内之所以有战争发生，是由于一个国家的既得利益集团推行侵略政策，企图统治另一个国家，剥削另一个国家的人民。镇压马来亚人民民族解放运动的是英帝国主义集团，进攻越南人民的是法国既得利益集团，在朝鲜发动最凶残的战争的是美国垄断资本集团。
    一个泰米尔文杂志的编辑多莱堪努说，在朝鲜以及其他地方发动战争的罪魁祸首是帝国主义者。印度人民有责任在维护和平的斗争中起重要作用。他在谈到即将举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议以及预定于九月在东旁遮普省朱龙多举行的第三届全印和平大会时说，马德拉斯人民应当派遣代表参加这两个和平会议，支持世界和平事业。
    全印学生联合会代表加雅代文和拉奥也在会上发表了演说。
    会议通过两项决议，其中一项决议说：“马德拉斯公民举行的这个会议，欢迎即将举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。”
    【新华社十八日讯】仰光消息：缅甸人民正积极展开迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备工作，全国的和平运动也随着筹备工作的展开而得到进一步的发展。
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会已决定组成代表团，出席定于今年九月在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。为了使代表团具有更广泛的代表性，能够包括各邦区、各阶层、各人民团体及文艺界和佛教徒的代表，缅甸的和平人士特地组成三个小组进行各项筹备工作。现在代表已经初步选出。
    和这同时，缅甸保卫世界和平委员会在七月十日发起的要求五大国缔结和平公约、反对武装日本及片面对日和约的签名运动，正在缅甸各地积极进行中。从七月十日到十二日的三天当中，仰光各市场内就有二千二百七十九个市民签名。在缅甸南部的勃固县，从七月十日到十九日签名的就有五千人。缅甸保卫世界和平委员会十九日在勃固县举行全县和平代表大会。会上，委员会副主席吴吞昂觉报告了美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行，出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的缅甸代表吴苗密报告了筹备会议的情况及和平会议的任务和目标。
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的另一个缅甸代表吴埃支在返国后，为了加强国际的和平关系，及将缅甸人民的和平斗争介绍给世界各国人民，正与作家八莫丁昂积极筹备出版“争取和平”英文半月刊。创刊号将在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开幕前出版。该刊内容将充分反映缅甸人民热烈支持和平会议的情形。
