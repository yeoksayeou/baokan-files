    British Mrs. Elsie Straling Writes to Chairman Mao Expressing Friendship with the Chinese People After Returning Home from Participating in the "May Day" Celebration in China
    [This newspaper dispatch] Mrs. Elsie Straling from Britain was invited to observe the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations in our country this year. After returning to her country, she wrote a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong. The original letter is as follows:
Dear Comrade Mao Zedong:
    I was one of the eight British delegates invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to attend the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations in your country. There were seven male delegates and myself – the only female delegate – representing the working class of our country.
    I feel a force urging me to write to you because since returning to England, there have been many demonstrations. One of them was a march against arms expansion and demanding an end to the Korean War and the Malayan War. This march was organized by the "Women's Congress," and I had the honor of holding a portrait of Mao Zedong during the march.
    Since returning home, I have not been able to settle down, half my heart is here, and the other half is still in China.
    When I was in China, I met and saw kind and lovely Chinese people everywhere, and I will always remember these moving impressions.
    "May Day" is a mirror that reflects your people's love and trust in you. From the beginning to the end of the parade, they showed their infinite loyalty to you. Their Chairman Mao and the Party have given them everything.
    Never has a country done so much for so many workers in such a short period after liberation.
    My heart goes out to the thousands of workers I saw building a sluice gate under the huge Huai River project. I will never forget their great enthusiasm for work. Everywhere we visited, even in remote areas, everyone had contributed to the liberation of their country. This is truly a remarkable thing.
    This visit to China has strengthened my confidence in the future. I know that no one can take away from the Chinese people the fruits they have fought so long to win.
    Now I realize the role that Chinese women have played in the struggle to liberate themselves, and I also realize that we British women must organize ourselves to defend peace, because only peace can bring our future a good life and hope like the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries.
    Only by telling the British people the truth about the great and rich China can my heart be at peace. I want to tell them that the people of New China are the most lovely and peace-loving, and that Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the New Chinese government, is their most beloved leader. I wish you good health and lasting peace.
    Your loving friend, Mrs. Elsie Straling

    英国艾尔希·司塔琳夫人在我国参加“五一”节返国后
    写信给毛主席表达对我国人民的友谊
    【本报讯】英国艾尔希·司塔琳夫人，今年“五一”国际劳动节曾应邀来我国观礼。她在返国后，写了一封信给毛泽东主席。原信如下：亲爱的毛泽东同志：
    我是应中华全国总工会的邀请，来贵国参加“五一”劳动节观礼的八个英国代表之一。我们共有七个男代表和我——仅有的一个女代表，代表着我国的工人阶级。
    我感觉着有一种力量敦促着我向您写信，因为自从我回国后，在英国有过许多次示威游行。其中有一次是反对扩张军备，要求停止朝鲜战争和马来亚战争的游行。这个游行是“妇女大会”组织的，在游行中我荣幸地举着毛泽东的画像。
    我回国后，还不能定下心来，半个心在这里，另一半还在中国。
    当我在中国的时候，我到处遇见和看到亲切可爱的中国人民，我要永远记着这些动人的印象。
    “五一”节是一面镜子，它反映出贵国人民对您的热爱与信赖，从游行的开始一直到结束，他们都表现出对您的无限忠诚。他们的毛主席和党带给了他们一切。
    从来没有一个国家解放后，在这么短的时期内为这么多的工人办了这么多的事情。
    我的心奔向我所看到的那些万千个在巨大的治淮计划下建筑着一个水闸的工人们，我将永远不会忘记他们那种伟大的工作热情。我们所参观的任何一个地方，即便是偏僻的地区，每一个人都曾为自己国家的解放出过力。这真是一件了不起的事。
    这次访问中国，加强了我对未来的信心，我知道没有任何人能从中国人民手中夺取他们为之斗争那么久而赢得的果实。
    现在我认识到中国妇女在解放自己的斗争中所起的作用，也认识到我们英国妇女必须把自己组织起来保卫和平，因为只有和平才能给我们的将来带来像苏联、中国和各人民民主国家那样美好的生活和希望。
    只有把伟大富饶的中国的真实情况告诉给英国人民，我的心才能得到安宁。我要告诉他们新中国人民是最可爱的，最爱和平的，新中国政府的领导者毛泽东主席是他们最敬爱的领袖。祝您身体健康，永远平安。
    您友爱的朋友　艾尔希·司塔琳夫人
