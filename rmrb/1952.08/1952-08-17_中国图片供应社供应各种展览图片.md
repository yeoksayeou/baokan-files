    China Pictures Supply Cooperative Supplies Various Exhibition Pictures

    The China Pictures Supply Cooperative, under the Xinhua News Agency, plans to produce several kinds of exhibition pictures, finely crafted on Hungarian enlargement paper, on a monthly basis starting in August, for mail orders from all over the country. The exhibition pictures to be supplied in August will include seven types: "Building a Strong, Regularized, and Modernized National Defense Army," "Heroically Fighting Korean People's Army," "Qi Jianhua's Rapid Literacy Method," "Chinese People's Liberation Army Enters Tibet," "Marx's Life and Works," "The Victory of Marxism in the Soviet Union," and "The Victory of Marxism in China." The recent development of the cooperative's exhibition picture supply work shows that the masses' need for exhibition pictures is increasing day by day. In the three months of the second quarter of this year, the China Pictures Supply Cooperative supplied 18 kinds of exhibition pictures to various places, producing a total of 1,293 sets (each set with a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 53 pictures), distributed to propaganda and education organs, organizations, cultural centers, libraries, bookstores, etc., in major provinces and cities across the country. Among them, the three types of pictures commemorating "July 1st": "Marx's Life and Works," "The Victory of Marxism in the Soviet Union," and "The Victory of Marxism in China," were the most widely sold, selling 377 sets in just ten days.
