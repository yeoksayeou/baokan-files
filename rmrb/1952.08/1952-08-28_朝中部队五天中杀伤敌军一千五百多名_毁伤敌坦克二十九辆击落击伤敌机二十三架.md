Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 27th—Fighting on the Eastern Front has been relatively frequent in the past five days. On the morning of the 22nd, in the area east of Mundung-ri, a unit of Turkish mercenary troops, under the cover of artillery fire, invaded one of our army's positions. Our defending troops, lying in ambush, waited until the enemy advanced to within 50 meters of the position, then suddenly opened fire with concentrated firepower. When the enemy faltered, they immediately launched a charge, killing or wounding more than 80 enemy troops. The remaining enemy fled in disarray. On the 23rd, a unit of Turkish troops ambushed another of our army's positions but were discovered and repelled by our troops, with 57 enemy troops killed or wounded. On the 24th, Turkish troops again attacked another of our army's positions, but were repelled by our defending troops after suffering more than 30 casualties. In these three battles, our defending troops suffered no casualties. In the area east of the Bukhan River, a unit of our army launched a surprise attack on an enemy position on the night of the 21st, killing or wounding more than 60 enemy troops. Ten kilometers south of Goseong, a unit of our army repelled an invasion by two companies of enemy troops on the night of the 22nd, killing or wounding more than 100 enemy troops.

On the Central and Western Fronts, our army also continuously repelled the incursions of American and British invading troops. On the 22nd, our army repelled an invasion by two companies of enemy troops on a hill over 300 meters high northwest of Kimhwa, killing or wounding more than 140 enemy troops. On the 23rd, a group of British troops invaded more than ten kilometers north of Gorampo-ri and were severely mauled by our army's ambushing troops, with only two escaping.

Our army's artillery fire is inflicting increasingly heavy blows on the enemy. According to incomplete statistics for the five days from the 20th to the 24th alone, our army's artillery fire killed or wounded 1,521 enemy troops, destroyed or damaged 29 enemy tanks, destroyed 7 enemy vehicles, and 2 mountain guns. In these five days, our front-line troops shot down or damaged 23 enemy aircraft in air defense operations.

    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】在最近五天中，东线的战斗比较频繁。二十二日清晨在文登里以东地区，土耳其帮凶军一部在炮火掩护下进犯我军的一处阵地。我守军预伏部队待该敌进到阵地前五十公尺处，突然以密集火力射击敌人，并在敌军动摇时马上发起冲锋，毙伤敌军八十多名，残敌狼狈逃窜。二十三日，土耳其军一部偷袭我军另一阵地，被我军发觉后将其击退，敌军伤亡五十七名。二十四日，土耳其军再向我军另一阵地进攻，被我守军毙伤三十多名后溃退。在这三次战斗中，我守军无一伤亡。在北汉江以东地区，我军某部二十一日夜曾向某处敌军阵地举行袭击，毙伤敌军六十多名。在高城以南十公里处，我军某部曾于二十二日夜击退敌军两个连的进犯，毙伤敌军一百多名。
    在中线和西线，我军也连续击退美英侵略军的窜犯。二十二日，我军在金化西北一个三百多公尺高的山岭上，击退敌军两个连的进犯，毙伤敌军一百四十多名。二十三日，英军一股进犯高浪浦里以北十余公里处，遭到我军伏击部队的痛歼，仅二名漏网逃去。
    我军炮火给予敌军的打击愈来愈大。仅据二十日到二十四日五天中的不完全统计，我军炮火杀伤敌军达一千五百二十一名，击毁击伤敌军坦克二十九辆，击毁敌军汽车七辆，山炮二门。在这五天中，我前线部队在对空作战中击落击伤敌军飞机二十三架。
