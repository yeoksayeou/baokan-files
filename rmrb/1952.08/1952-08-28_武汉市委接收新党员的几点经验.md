    Several Experiences of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee in Accepting New Party Members
    By the Organization Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    For more than a year, the Party organizations in Wuhan City have not accepted new Party members. However, after a series of mass movements, especially the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in the past six months, a large number of activists have emerged from the working class and laboring people of Wuhan City. Some of them have been tested in various movements for a long time and have actually met the requirements for joining the Party. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee arranged for the work of accepting new Party members. According to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee, the grassroots Party organizations widely publicized the significance of Party building and the eight criteria for Communist Party members. The grassroots organizations, in conjunction with the current central work, adopted the method of open Party building to carry out the Party building work.

    At the "July 1st" commemorative meeting, the Municipal Party Committee selected a group of new Party members from the 300 new Party members it had admitted to participate in the oath-taking ceremony. Among these new Party members were Zhang Shihuan and Wu Dongshan, veteran workers who had participated in the "February 7th" General Strike; and Zhu Jiu and Shen Guiying, well-known model workers. The conference was broadcast live to the city. More than 30,000 people listened to the broadcast throughout the city, and many units organized discussions and seminars in a timely manner based on the live broadcast of the conference.

    This time, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee accepted new Party members in a guided, prepared, and planned manner; it was also the beginning of Party building work. Although the number of units accepting new Party members this time was small, and the number of people was not large; the educational effect on Party members and the masses was very significant, which strongly promoted the future Party building work.

    Through this work of accepting new Party members, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee has gained the following main experiences:

    First, it is necessary to specifically and vividly publicize the eight criteria for Communist Party members. In the past, the Party organizations in Wuhan City only generally publicized the eight criteria, without making specific and vivid publicity. As a result, many people could not specifically understand the eight criteria, and even many Communist Party members who already met the criteria mistakenly believed that they did not meet the criteria. When these people measured the candidates for Party membership, they felt that this person did not meet the criteria, and that person did not meet the criteria either. The general public regarded the eight criteria for Communist Party members as unattainable. Some older people and those with more complex histories were even more afraid to apply for Party membership. Through the "July 1st" new Party member oath-taking conference, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee specifically publicized the eight criteria for Communist Party members, so that everyone understood what kind of people met the eight criteria for Communist Party members and what kind of people did not meet the eight criteria. This eliminated the mystified view of the eight criteria for Communist Party members held by some people. The branch secretary of the Wuchang Post Office said: "In the past, I always felt that this person was not good enough and that person was not good enough. After seeing the 'living eight articles' this time, the problem was solved." This publicity had an even greater effect among the masses. Many activists said happily: "The door of the Communist Party is open. The Party has publicly and specifically explained the eight criteria for Communist Party members to us. As long as we all work hard to improve our awareness, we can join the Communist Party." Many old workers, after seeing a 66-year-old worker join the Party, also wrote down their determination to strive to join the Party. People with complex histories also understood that as long as they explained their history to the Party clearly and met the eight criteria for Communist Party members, they could still join the Party. In individual factories, 50% of the people have expressed their desire to strive to join the Communist Party.

    Second, Party building work must be combined with the current movement. Party building work and the central work are unified. Separating Party building work from the current movement is one of the reasons why the Party organizations in Wuhan City have not developed new Party members for more than a year. The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee accepted this lesson and combined this Party development work with the ideological construction and organizational construction of the final stage of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, which achieved good results. In ideological construction, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee paid attention to drawing a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the bourgeoisie, and used the ideology of the working class to criticize bourgeois ideology and other erroneous ideologies, explaining that the eight criteria for Communist Party members are the embodiment of the ideology of the working class. Therefore, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee called on all state personnel to study the eight criteria for Communist Party members. Through this study, everyone criticized various erroneous ideas and clearly recognized their direction of struggle. In organizational construction, the Party organization took the development of the Party as one of the central contents, determined the development targets of new Party members, and carried out investigation work.

    In factories, Party organizations not only combined Party building work with the ideological construction and organizational construction of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, but also directly combined this work with the current production movement. The result of carrying out Party building propaganda in the production movement greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor and promoted the progress of the production movement. Shen Guiying, a model worker at Yuhua Yarn Factory, proposed to increase from watching 400 spindles to watching 600 spindles when applying for Party membership. Other workers also expressed: "If Shen Guiying watches 600 spindles, we will watch at least 500 spindles." Wang Baolin, an old worker in the steel wire workshop of the South Factory of the First Cotton Mill, proposed to increase from watching 13 steel wire machines to watching 20 steel wire machines when applying for Party membership. Now the entire workshop has increased to watching 20 steel wire machines, saving the country ten and a half workdays every day.

    Third, regard Party building work as a regular task. The Party Constitution stipulates that the development of the Party is a regular task, and every Party organization and every Party member must actively carry it out. The development of the Party in Wuhan City has been at a standstill for a long time; some people have even completely forgotten this work; or have abandoned Party building work on the grounds of being busy with work. Therefore, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee criticized these phenomena at the beginning of this Party building work, emphasizing that Party building work is a regular task and must be carried out by the entire Party. On the other hand, it also pointed out that a cautious approach must be adopted, and Party member standards must not be simplified or lowered. This correctly and quickly promoted the development of the Party.

    The development of the Party in Wuhan this time was basically successful, and the Party members accepted all met the eight criteria for Communist Party members. However, a small number of branches have hastily accepted Party members. For example, some introducers did not make detailed and responsible introductions to the introducees, but simply and vaguely said that the introducees should "strengthen political study and actively contact the masses." Some even adopted the wrong method of "mass recommendation, branch approval." Although these phenomena have been corrected in a timely manner, attention should still be paid to preventing similar phenomena from occurring in the future.

    武汉市委接收新党员的几点经验
    中共武汉市委组织部
    一年多来，武汉市的党组织没有接收新党员。但武汉市的工人阶级和劳动人民经过了一系列的群众运动，特别是最近半年来的“三反”“五反”运动，已涌现出了大批的积极分子。其中有一部分人已久经各种运动的考验，实际上已具备了入党条件。“三反”运动以后，中共武汉市委布置了接收新党员的工作。根据市委的指示，党的基层组织广泛地宣传了建党的意义和共产党员标准的八项条件。各基层组织并结合当前的中心工作，采取公开建党的方式，来进行建党工作。
    在“七一”纪念大会上，市委从所接收的三百名新党员中，挑选了一批新党员参加大会宣誓。在这批新党员中，有参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人张士汉、吴东山；有著名劳动模范朱玖、沈桂英等等。这次大会同时向全市进行了实况广播。全市收听者约有三万人以上，许多单位并根据大会实况广播及时组织了讨论和座谈。
    武汉市委这次接收新党员是有领导有准备有计划地进行的；也是进行建党工作的开始。虽然这次接收新党员的单位不多，数量不大；但对党员和群众的教育作用是很大的，有力地推动了今后的建党工作。
    武汉市委通过这次接收新党员的工作，取得了下列几点主要经验：
    第一，要具体地生动地宣传共产党员标准的八项条件。过去武汉市的党组织只是一般地宣传八项条件，而没有作具体的生动的宣传。以致使许多人不能具体认识八项条件，甚至连许多已够共产党员标准的共产党员也错认为自己不够标准。而这些人去衡量入党对象时，也就觉得这个人也不够标准，那个人也不够标准。一般群众则更把共产党员标准的八项条件看得高不可攀。有些年纪大的和历史比较复杂的人则更加不敢申请入党。武汉市委通过这次“七一”新党员的入党宣誓大会，具体地宣传了共产党员标准的八项条件，使大家懂得了什么样的人够共产党员标准的八项条件，什么样的人不够八项条件。这样就消除了一部分人对共产党员标准的八项条件的神秘化的看法。武昌邮局的支部书记说：“以前我总觉得这个人不够，那个人不够，这次看到了‘活八条’，就解决了这个问题。”这次宣传，在群众中收到了更大的效果。许多积极分子都高兴地说：“共产党的门是开着的，党已公开地具体地向我们交代了共产党员标准的八项条件，只要我们大家努力提高自己的觉悟，就可以参加共产党。”许多年老的工人看到一个六十六岁的老工人入党后，也都写下了争取入党的决心书。历史复杂的人也明白了只要把自己的历史对党交代清楚，具备了共产党员标准的八项条件后，仍可以入党。在个别工厂中，已有百分之五十的人表示要争取参加共产党。
    第二，建党工作要结合当前的运动进行。建党工作和中心工作是统一的。把建党工作和当前的运动分割开来，这是武汉市的党组织一年多来没有发展新党员的原因之一。武汉市委接受了这一教训，把这次发展党的工作，和“三反”“五反”运动最后阶段的思想建设和组织建设结合进行，收到了很好的效果。在思想建设中，武汉市委注意了划清工人阶级和资产阶级的思想界限，以工人阶级思想去批判资产阶级思想和其他的错误思想，说明共产党员标准的八项条件正是工人阶级思想的体现。因此武汉市委号召所有的国家工作人员学习共产党员标准的八项条件。通过这一学习，大家批判了各种错误思想，明确认识了自己的奋斗方向。在组织建设中，党组织就把发展党的工作作为中心内容之一，确定新党员的发展对象，进行考察工作等等。
    在工厂中，党的组织不仅结合着“三反”“五反”运动的思想建设和组织建设进行了建党工作，而且还直接结合着当前的生产运动进行了这一工作。在生产运动中进行建党宣传的结果，大大鼓舞了工人的劳动热情，推动了生产运动的前进。裕华纱厂劳动模范沈桂英在申请入党时就提出了从看四百锭子提高到看六百锭子。其他的工人也纷纷表示：“沈桂英看六百锭子，我们至少看五百锭子。”第一纱厂南厂钢丝车间老工人汪宝林在申请入党时，提出从看十三部钢丝车提高到看二十部钢丝车。现在全车间都提高到看二十部钢丝车，每天为国家节省十个半工作日。
    第三，把建党工作当作一个经常性的工作。党章中规定发展党的工作是一个经常性的工作，每个党组织，每个党员都必须积极地去进行。武汉市发展党的工作在较长的一个时期内是陷于停顿状态的；甚至有人根本忘记了这个工作；或者藉口工作繁忙而放弃了建党工作。因此，武汉市委这次建党工作之初就批判了这些现象，强调建党工作是一个经常性的工作，而且必须全党动手来作。另一方面，又指出必须采取慎重的方针，决不能草率和降低党员标准。这样就正确地迅速地推动了发展党的工作。
    武汉市这次发展党的工作基本上是成功的，所接收的党员都是符合共产党员标准的八项条件的。但也有少数支部有草率接收党员的现象。例如有的介绍人对被介绍人未做详细负责的介绍，而只是简单空洞地说介绍对象应该“加强政治学习，主动联系群众”。甚至还有的采取了“群众推荐，支部通过”的错误方法。这些现象虽都及时纠正了，但今后仍应注意防止类似现象的发生。
