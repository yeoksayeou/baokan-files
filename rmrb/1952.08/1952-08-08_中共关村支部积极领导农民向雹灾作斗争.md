    The Communist Party Branch of Guancun Actively Leads Peasants in the Struggle Against Hailstorms
    Editor: The Communist Party Branch of Guancun, Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, has achieved great success in leading the village peasants in the struggle against hailstorms. On July 8th, hailstorms hit the first, second, and sixth districts of Changzhi County, causing damage to some crops. At this time, some village cadres and masses in Guancun developed negative emotions. In response to this situation, the branch first convened an enlarged cadre meeting, guiding everyone to recall the village's past experience in overcoming natural disasters and repeatedly explaining the principle of
    "Man will conquer nature", reversing everyone's negative emotions and boosting their confidence in fighting the hailstorm. Then everyone discussed what crops would be most suitable to replant under the current circumstances. The discussion resulted in persuading the masses to plant millet, kidney beans, and early-maturing vegetables. After the meeting, the branch immediately mobilized sixteen village cadres to form three working groups to investigate the disaster situation and use various occasions to publicize the information to the masses. The result of village cadre Gao Desheng's propaganda at the meal gathering encouraged Li Xiancheng and five others to fight against the hailstorm, and they immediately went to the fields to support the seedlings. The branch then broadcasted the activities of Li Xiancheng and others to the masses, and put forward the slogan "Don't wait, don't be pessimistic, act quickly, replant quickly," mobilizing the masses to actively resist the disaster, support seedlings, and replant. In this way, the masses were mobilized, and those who should replant seedlings or change seedlings went to replant seedlings or change seedlings. In addition, under the leadership of the branch, everyone showed a spirit of friendship and used mutual aid and loan methods to solve the problem of some farmers lacking seeds. Now the Party branch is continuing to lead the villagers to topdress fertilizer, support seedlings, replant, and resolutely fight the hailstorm to the end.

    中共关村支部积极领导农民向雹灾作斗争
    编辑同志：中共山西省长治县关村支部领导全村农民向雹灾作斗争有了很大成绩。七月八日，长治县一、二、六区下了雹子，一部分庄稼受了损失。这时，关村有些村干部和群众产生了消极情绪。支部针对这一情况，首先召开了扩大干部会议，引导大家回忆本村过去克服自然灾害的经验，反复说明
    “人定胜天”的道理，扭转了大家的消极情绪，提高了和雹灾作斗争的信心。接着大家讨论了在现在情况下抢种什么庄稼最合适的问题。讨论结果：是劝说群众种糜黍、小豆及早熟的菜蔬。会后，支部立即动员了十六个村干部，组成三个工作小组，进行受灾情况的调查，并利用各种场合，向群众宣传。村干部高德胜在饭场上进行宣传的结果，鼓舞了李贤成等六人向雹灾作斗争的情绪，他们马上下地扶苗去了。支部又把李贤成等人的活动向群众进行了广播，并提出“不等待、不悲观、快行动、快补田”的口号，动员群众积极起来，全力抗灾、扶苗、补种。这样，群众发动起来了，该补苗或改苗的都去补苗或改苗去了。另外，在支部的领导下，大家发挥了友爱精神，用互助借贷的方法解决了一些农民缺少种子的问题。现在党支部正继续领导全村农民上追肥、扶苗、补种，和雹灾坚决地斗争到底。
