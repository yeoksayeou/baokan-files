    Strictly Supervise the Storage of "1605" Insecticide
    Comrade Editor: The "1605" insecticide that has been promoted in Gaocheng County, Hebei Province this year is very effective, and the masses welcome it. However, some people do not know how to store this medicine properly, which has led to incidents of poisoning deaths. Zhang Locai, the village chief of Liujiazhuang Village in Gaocheng, put the medicine in a wine pot. His father didn't know this, drank a sip as wine, and died within a few minutes. Li Suozi's young nephew in Xibailu Village treated the "1605" concentrate as candy, dipped it with his finger and ate a little, and was also poisoned to death. Zhou Luozhong's son in Changzi Village drank a sip of "1605" diluted to a ratio of 1 to 160 times, and was poisoned to death half an hour later.

    I suggest that when promoting this medicine in various places, it is imperative to explain its usage and storage precautions to the masses in detail to avoid danger.   Li Huazhang Liu Huixu

    Editor's Note: "1605" is an effective insecticide that can poison various pests. However, this pesticide is highly toxic, and it is very dangerous if people or animals accidentally drink it. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently issued a circular requiring all localities to strengthen technical guidance to the masses when promoting this pesticide, so as to avoid poisoning incidents involving people and animals. We hope that all localities will pay universal attention to this.

### 严格保管“一六○五”杀虫药

    严格保管“一六○五”杀虫药
    编辑同志：今年推广到河北省藁城县的“一六○五”杀虫药的效力很大，群众都很欢迎。但有些群众不会保管这种药，以致发生了毒死人的事件。藁城刘家庄村村长张洛才把这种药放在酒壶里，他父亲不知道，当作酒喝了一口，几分钟就死了。西白露村李锁子的小外甥，把“一六○五”原液当作糖饴，用手指沾着吃了一点，也被毒死了。长子村周洛中的儿子喝了一口一比一六○倍的“一六○五”稀释液，半小时后就被毒死了。
    我建议各地推广这种药的时候，一定要向群众详细讲解它的用法和保管注意事项，以免发生危险。    李化章    刘惠续
    编者按：“一六○五”是一种有效的杀虫药，能毒杀各种害虫。但是，这种农药有强烈的毒性，人畜如果误饮，非常危险。中央人民政府农业部最近曾发出通报，要求各地在推广这种农药时，必须对群众加强技术指导，以免发生毒害人畜事件，望各地普遍加以注意。
