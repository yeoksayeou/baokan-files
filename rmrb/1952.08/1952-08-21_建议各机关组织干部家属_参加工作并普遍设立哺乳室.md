    Suggest that All Organizations Organize Cadre Family Members
    to Participate in Work and Universally Establish Nursing Rooms
    Comrade Editor: When all regions are vigorously carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, I thought about the work problem of the family members of cadres in various organizations and the problem of universally setting up nursing rooms in various organizations.
    Many family members of cadres in various organizations live in the organization's dormitories without any organization. Apart from cooking or taking care of children, they have no other work. They enjoy the treatment of "family grain" and can get food and clothing without labor. Some of them hope to work, but they are troubled by not being able to find work. Others, because they have children, feel that if they participate in work, they will not be able to place their children (cannot afford a nanny), so they simply do not plan to work. Still others think that they have no culture or technology and cannot work. I think that the leading cadres of various organizations and the organization's trade unions should organize such family members of organization cadres to enable them to participate in work or study. This is beneficial to themselves, to the cadres, and to the country. There are still some female cadres who continue to work while taking care of their children, which affects their study, work, and health. The health and safety of the children are also affected. But there are also some women cadres who hire a nanny for every child they raise. I once saw a female cadre who had eight children and hired six nannies. Isn't this a waste of manpower? Therefore, I think the establishment of nursing rooms in organizations is very necessary. If there are few children in some organizations, they can jointly establish nursing rooms with nearby organizations. For example, about ten units directly under the Northwest Military and Political Committee live very close to each other, and there are more than one hundred children of cadres. If one hundred nannies are hired, it is very uneconomical! If these one hundred nannies are organized into factories or other production units, they can definitely create great wealth for the country. Therefore, the establishment of nursing rooms should become one of the tasks of the general affairs departments and trade unions of various organizations.
    The above suggestions are provided for reference by various organizations.　Cai Dejun

### 建议各机关组织干部家属  参加工作并普遍设立哺乳室

    建议各机关组织干部家属
    参加工作并普遍设立哺乳室
    编辑同志：当各地大力开展增产节约运动的时候，我想到各机关干部家属的工作问题和各机关普遍设置哺乳室的问题。
    很多机关干部的家属，她们毫无组织地住在机关宿舍里，除了做饭或带小孩以外，再没有其他工作。她们享有“家属粮”的待遇，不劳动就可以得到吃、穿。她们中的一部分，是希望工作的，但苦于找不到工作。另一部分，因为有小孩，她们觉得如果参加工作，便无法安置孩子（雇不起保姆），便干脆不打算工作了。还有一部分，她们认为自己没有文化也没有技术，不能工作。我认为，各机关领导干部和机关工会应该把这样的机关干部家属组织起来，使她们参加工作或学习。这对她们本身、对干部、对国家都是有利的。现在还有些女干部，一面带小孩，一面仍继续工作，结果是学习、工作和健康都受了影响，孩子的健康、安全也受到影响。但也有些妇女干部，养一个小孩就雇一个保姆。我曾经看到一位妇女干部有了八个小孩，便雇了六个保姆。这不是浪费人力吗？因此，我认为机关中哺乳室的设立是非常必要的。有的机关孩子少，可以和附近的机关联合设立哺乳室。如西北军政委员会直属的约十个单位都住得很近，干部的小孩在一百个以上。如果请一百个保姆，是很不经济的！如果把这一百个保姆组织到工厂或其他生产单位，一定可以为国家创造很大的财富。所以，设立哺乳室应该成为各机关总务部门和机关工会的工作之一。
    以上意见提供各机关参考。　蔡德俊
