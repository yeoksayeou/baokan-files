Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, Iron and Steel Industry Bureau
Accepts Suggestions for Exchanging Smelting Experience

To the Editors:

We believe that Comrade Zhou Chuandian's letter, published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on July 29th, suggesting that we organize national steel plants to exchange smelting technical experience and organize mutual visits, is a very good idea. We are currently preparing to ask each factory for their opinions on this issue, and then formulate unified measures to implement it. Regarding the issue of convening a national professional conference to summarize and promote advanced experience, we also plan to do this work during the increased production and frugality campaign in the second half of the year.

    接受交流冶炼经验的建议
    编辑同志：人民日报七月二十九日“读者来信”栏刊载周传典同志来信，建议我们组织全国各钢铁厂交换冶炼技术经验，并组织相互参观，我们认为他的意见很好。我们最近准备请各厂就这个问题提出意见，然后再拟定统一办法，付诸实现。关于召开全国性专业会议总结和推广先进经验问题，我们也计划在下半年增产节约运动中做这一工作。
