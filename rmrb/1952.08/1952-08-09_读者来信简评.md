Reader's Letters Briefly Reviewed

(I) The Work of Magazine Distribution Must Be Done Well

Our magazines are important tools for educating the masses and improving their political awareness, professional skills, and cultural level. Strengthening the work of magazine distribution so that magazines can reach readers in a timely and accurate manner is an extremely important political task. Otherwise, any magazine will not be able to play its due role. Readers' requests to correct certain chaotic phenomena in the current magazine distribution work are justified. Publishing and distribution agencies at all levels should pay attention to and solve this problem.

In order to correct the chaotic phenomena in the magazine distribution work, we must first improve the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the distribution staff. We must make the vast number of distribution staff understand that they are the link between the publishing agency and the vast number of readers, and the quality of their work directly affects the political effect that magazines can exert. Therefore, they should treat their work as a major political task and do a good job in magazine distribution with a high spirit of serving the people and serving the readers.

Secondly, we believe that the current magazine distribution system of "accepting subscriptions and mailing them at any time" needs to be improved. This system was suitable for the past when publishing and distribution were not separated, but today, when publishing and distribution have been separated and are gradually moving towards planned production, it is gradually becoming unsuitable. This system not only makes the subscription management procedures of distribution agencies very complicated and prone to errors, but also makes it impossible for distribution agencies to accurately grasp the number of subscribers and retail sales, resulting in blindness in the work and a huge waste of manpower and materials. According to statistics from the Xinhua Bookstore Main Store, because the number of new subscribers is increasing, the number of magazines reserved is not enough. In the second and third quarters of last year, they requested subscribers to postpone their subscriptions 18,000 times; on the other hand, the number of certain reserved magazines that were overstocked due to the reduction of new subscribers totaled 240,000 copies in the second half of last year, worth more than 400 million yuan. Therefore, distribution agencies should absorb the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and, based on China's actual situation, try out the method of regularly collecting magazine subscriptions, that is, setting a certain time each year to solicit magazine subscribers. This will not only strengthen the planning of distribution work, simplify distribution procedures, and reduce the chaotic phenomena in distribution work, but also reduce distribution costs and alleviate the burden on readers.

(II) Everyone Should Protect State Secrets

Consciously protecting state secrets is the duty of every state employee. Since the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Instructions on Government Employees at All Levels Protecting State Secrets" in February 1950, and the "Provisional Regulations on Protecting State Secrets" in June 1951, generally speaking, the confidentiality work of various agencies has been gradually strengthened, and state employees have paid more attention to protecting state secrets than before. However, according to the information reflected in the letters from readers of this newspaper, cases of certain agencies or agency staff members leaking and losing secrets still occur constantly. Some agency staff members casually discuss internal issues of the agency in public entertainment venues or on public transportation vehicles, and even intentionally or unintentionally talk about major national military and political plans; some staff members casually carry documents outside, and sometimes even lose documents in public places; some agencies still do not have strict document storage and retrieval systems, and some people even throw top-secret documents in waste paper piles, or use internal materials as waste paper wrappers to send things. These staff members who do not pay attention to protecting state secrets have serious thoughts of underestimating the enemy and being麻痹 ( numb/careless ), and lack the due sense of responsibility to the country and the people. If they cannot immediately wake up, they will not only cause many unnecessary losses to the country, but they themselves will also commit serious mistakes.

In order to eradicate these phenomena of leaking and losing secrets, we must further implement the spirit of the State Council's "Instructions on Protecting State Secrets" and conscientiously implement the "Provisional Regulations on Protecting State Secrets." People's governments, armed forces, people's organizations, and factories and mines at all levels must further strengthen education on protecting state secrets to their subordinates, cultivate state agencies' staff members' consciousness and discipline of strictly protecting state secrets; must establish strict systems and disciplines for protecting state secrets, and give necessary punishments to those who neglect confidentiality work and therefore leak and lose secrets, depending on the severity of the circumstances. Education on protecting state secrets should also be carried out among the broad masses of the people so that all the people understand that protecting state secrets is the duty of every citizen. In order to strengthen the inspection of confidentiality work, the supervisory organs of people's governments at all levels should include the supervision of protecting state secrets as one of their regular tasks.

专栏：读者来信简评

    读者来信简评
    （一）必须做好期刊发行工作
    我们的期刊是教育群众、提高群众的政治觉悟和业务、文化水平的重要工具。加强期刊发行工作，使期刊能够及时、准确地到达读者手中，是一项极为重要的政治任务。否则，任何期刊都将不能发挥应有的作用。读者要求纠正目前期刊发行工作中的某些混乱现象，这种要求是正当的。各级出版发行机关应该重视并解决这个问题。
    为了纠正期刊发行工作中的混乱现象，首先必须提高发行工作人员的积极性和负责精神。要使广大发行工作人员懂得，他们是出版机关和广大读者之间的纽带，他们的工作的好坏，直接影响期刊可能发挥的政治效果。因此，他们应该把自己的工作当成一个重大的政治任务来执行，要以高度的为人民、为读者服务的精神，把期刊发行工作作好。
    其次，我们认为，目前实行的“随时收订、随时寄发”的期刊发行制度，有加以改进的必要。这种制度适合于过去出版和发行尚未分工的情况，但在今天出版和发行业已分工，并已逐步走向计划生产的时候，它就逐渐不适用了。这种制度，不但使发行机构的订户管理的手续十分繁杂，容易发生错误，而且使发行机构不能正确地掌握订户和零售的数量，造成工作中的盲目性和人力物力的巨大浪费。根据新华书店总店统计，他们因新订户日益增多，预留期刊的数量不够，在去年第二、三两季曾有一万八千次商请订户延期订阅期刊；另一方面，因新订户减少而积压的某些预留期刊，在去年下半年共达二十四万册，折款四亿余元。因此，发行机构应该吸收苏联的先进经验，根据我国实际情况，试行期刊定期收订的办法，即在每年规定一定时间，征收期刊订户。这不但能够加强发行工作的计划性，简化发行手续，减少发行工作的混乱现象，同时又能减低发行成本，减轻读者负担。
    （二）大家都要保守国家机密
    自觉地保守国家机密，是每一个国家工作人员应尽的职责。自从中央人民政府政务院在一九五○年二月公布了“关于各级政府工作人员保守国家机密的指示”，并在一九五一年六月公布了“保守国家机密暂行条例”以后，一般地说，各机关的保密工作是逐渐加强了，国家工作人员对于保守国家机密，也较前注意了。但是，根据本报读者来信反映的情况看来，某些机关或机关工作人员泄密、失密的事情，仍然不断发生。某些机关工作人员在公共娱乐场所或公共交通车上，随意谈论机关内部的问题，甚至有意无意地谈论国家的军政大计；有些工作人员随意携带文件外出，有时竟至把文件遗失在公共场所；某些机关直到现在还没有建立严格的文件保管和收回的制度，有人竟把绝密文件扔在废纸堆里，或者以内部材料当作废纸包送东西。这些不注意保守国家机密的工作人员，存在着严重的轻敌麻痹思想，缺乏对国家、对人民应有的责任心。他们如果不能立即警醒过来，不但要给国家造成许多不应有的损失，他们自己也要犯严重的错误。
    为了根绝这些泄密、失密的现象，必须进一步贯彻政务院“关于保守国家机密的指示”的精神，认真执行“保守国家机密暂行条例”。各级人民政府武装部队、人民团体和工厂、矿山等单位，必须进一步对所属人员加强保守国家机密的教育，培养国家机关工作人员严格保守国家机密的自觉性和纪律性；必须建立严格的保守国家机密的制度和纪律，对忽视保密工作因而发生泄密、失密行为者，根据情节轻重，给予必要的处分。对于广大人民群众，也应该进行保守国家机密的教育，使全体人民都了解保守国家机密是每个人民的义务。为了加强保密工作的检查工作，各级人民政府的监察机关应将保护国家机密的监察工作，列为经常任务之一。
