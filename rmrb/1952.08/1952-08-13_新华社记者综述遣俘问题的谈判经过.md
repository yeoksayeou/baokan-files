Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 11th: This agency's special correspondent reports: The plenary session of the armistice negotiations delegation, which was adjourned at the insistence of the US side, reconvened today (August 11th).

It should be pointed out that the negotiations on the issue of prisoners of war have lasted for a full eight months. This is entirely the result of deliberate delays by the US side, but so far the US side does not intend to end this shameful behavior.

The rights and wrongs of the prisoner of war issue have always been very clear. On the second day of the discussion of this issue, i.e., December 12th of last year, our side put forward a plan that fully complied with the Geneva Convention and humanitarian principles, namely, both sides should repatriate all prisoners of war held by them. However, the US side did not put forward its so-called "one-for-one exchange" and "voluntary repatriation" schemes, which attempted to detain a large number of prisoners of war, until three weeks later. Because the US side insisted on its absurd demands, the negotiations in January this year achieved nothing. In early February, in order to dispel the US side's excuse that the repatriation of prisoners of war would increase our military strength, our side suggested that all prisoners of war should not participate in the Korean War after being repatriated, so that they could return home to live peaceful lives. This was a major step forward in the negotiations on the prisoner of war issue. Immediately afterwards, the staff meeting began to discuss the specific arrangements for repatriation. During this period, in order to promote the conclusion of an agreement, our side accepted many of the US side's opinions and even clauses, such as the agreement on mutual visits to prisoner of war camps by the Red Cross after the armistice.

By early March, the entire prisoner of war issue was only left with the principle of repatriation. In order to break the deadlock, our side made another major effort in March, stating that foreign prisoners of war and Korean prisoners of war whose homes were in the original party should be fully repatriated, while Korean prisoners of war whose homes were in the receiving party should be allowed to return home locally without repatriation, and suggested that both sides immediately begin correcting the prisoner of war lists. However, the US side, which deliberately detained a large number of prisoners of war and was unwilling to cease fire, absurdly proposed the number of 70,000 prisoners of war to be repatriated to our side, attempting to detain 100,000 of our prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder. From the end of April, the prisoner of war issue became the only unresolved issue in the entire negotiations. In the two months that followed, the US side refused to abandon its demand for forcibly detaining prisoners of war within the conference and adjourned unilaterally several times; in its various prisoner of war camps, it continued to carry out large-scale massacres, creating more than ten blood cases that aroused public outrage, so that the conference was in a deadlock for a long time.

In early July, after the US side stated that the solution to the problem should meet the requirements of both parties to a reasonable extent, our side made the greatest effort again, suggesting that according to the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war in Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement that had been agreed upon by both parties and the principle of guaranteeing that all prisoners of war would return home to live peaceful lives in Article 52, the lists should be re-corrected according to nationality and region, and the result should be close to the number of 116,000 that the US side had admitted, including 20,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. However, the US side, which was still unwilling to cease fire, put forward the absurd number of 83,000 people to be repatriated, plotting to detain 20% of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war and 68% of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. In order to promote the armistice, our side suggested at the end of July to finalize the text of the draft armistice agreement. After the US side was forced to accept this suggestion, it delayed in many ways at the meeting, but thanks to the efforts of our side, all the clauses of the draft agreement were finally determined.

The only obstacle to reaching an armistice at present is that the US side refuses to repatriate our captured personnel in accordance with Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement. People all over the world demand that the US side abandon its unreasonable demand to detain prisoners of war and put forward the above-mentioned reasonable number of prisoners of war to be repatriated, so that the armistice agreement can be signed immediately. However, during the seven days of this adjournment, Lovett, Finletter, Joy and others in the United States have been repeating the hackneyed tune of applying "military pressure" to the Korean-Chinese side, US military aircraft continue to bomb peaceful towns in Korea wildly, and frequently harass the Chinese border. The US side is obviously keen on the so-called "military pressure" and increasingly long adjournments, and has no intention of solving the problem. In fact, the experience on the battlefield and at the negotiating table has clearly proved to the US side that only by abandoning the dream of so-called "military pressure" and honestly and quickly solving the problem is their real way out. The US side should bear in mind the lesson of having to return to the conference table to solve the problem after suffering a disastrous defeat in launching the so-called summer-autumn offensive last year. The Korean-Chinese side will fight to the end to realize the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war and guaranteeing that all prisoners of war can return home to live peaceful lives.

### 新华社记者综述遣俘问题的谈判经过

    新华社记者综述遣俘问题的谈判经过
    【新华社开城十一日电】本社特派记者报道：在美方坚持休会下的停战谈判代表团大会今天（十一日）复会了。
    应当指出：战俘问题的谈判已经整整八个月了。这完全是美方故意拖延的结果，但至今美方并不打算结束这种可耻的行为。
    遣俘问题上历来谁是谁非是非常清楚的。在这问题开始讨论的第二天，即去年十二月十二日，我方即提出了完全符合日内瓦公约与人道原则的双方遣返其收容下的全部战俘的方案。但美方迟至三星期后才提出所谓“一对一交换”“自愿遣返”的企图扣留大批战俘的方案。由于美方坚持其荒谬主张，今年一月份的谈判毫无成就。二月初，我方为了解除美方所谓遣返战俘会增加我方军事力量的借口，建议全部战俘被遣返后不再参加朝鲜战争，以便他们回家过和平生活。这使战俘问题的谈判跨了一大步。随即进入参谋会议商谈遣俘的具体安排，其间我方为了促进协议的达成，接受了许多美方的意见以至条文，如关于停战后双方红十字会访问战俘营的协议等。
    至三月初，整个战俘问题只剩下遣俘的原则。为了打破僵局，我方在三月份又作了重大努力，表示外籍战俘与家在原属一方的朝籍战俘应全部遣返，家在收容一方的朝籍战俘许其就地回家，不必遣返，并建议双方立即进入校正战俘名单。但蓄意扣留大批战俘不愿停战的美方极端荒谬地提出遣返我方七万战俘的数字，妄图扣下我方十万名战俘充当炮灰。四月底起，遣俘问题就成为整个谈判中唯一尚未解决的问题。这以后两个多月中，美方在会内丝毫不肯放弃强迫扣留战俘的主张，并数次片面休会；在其各战俘营内则继续大肆屠杀，制造十余次激起公愤的血案，以至会议长期陷入僵局。
    七月初，在美方表示问题的解决要在合理程度上适合双方要求后，我方又作了最大努力，建议根据双方已同意的停战协定草案第五十一款释放与遣返全部战俘的原则与五十二款的保证全部战俘回家过和平生活的原则，依照国籍与地区重新校正名单，其结果应接近美方所曾承认的十一万六千数字，包括两万名中国人民志愿军战俘。但依然不愿停战的美方却提出荒谬的遣返八万三千人的数字，阴谋扣留朝鲜人民军战俘的百分之二十与中国人民志愿军战俘的百分之六十八。为了促成停战，我方又于七月底建议最后确定停战协定草案的文字。美方被迫接受这一建议后，在会上曾多方拖延，但由于我方的努力，协定草案的全部条款终于确定下来。
    目前达成停战的唯一障碍就是美方拒绝按照停战协定草案第五十一与五十二款遣返我方被俘人员。全世界人民都要求美方放弃扣留战俘的无理主张，提出上述的遣返战俘的合理数字，使停战协定马上能够签字。但是在这次休会的七天中，美国的罗维特、芬立脱、乔埃等都重复着对朝中方面施行“军事压力”的滥调，美军飞机继续狂炸朝鲜的和平城镇，并频繁地骚扰中国边境。美方显然是热中于所谓“军事压力”与时间愈来愈长的休会，而无意于解决问题。其实战场上与谈判桌上的经验已十分清楚地向美方证明了：只有放弃所谓“军事压力”的梦想，老老实实迅速地解决问题，才是他们的真正出路。美方应牢记去年发动所谓夏秋季攻势遭受惨败后不得不回到会议桌上来解决问题的教训。朝中方面将为实现释放与遣返全部战俘并保证全部战俘都能回家过和平生活的原则而奋斗到底。
