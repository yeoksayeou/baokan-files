Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th. Since the American airmen Quinn and Enoch, captured by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, confessed the details of their own germ bomb droppings, the American aggressors, who committed unprecedentedly serious crimes against all mankind, have been in an extremely embarrassing situation. Neither US Secretary of State Acheson nor the US news agencies dared to argue with the specific facts in Quinn and Enoch's confessions. After issuing one or two self-contradictory statements and evasive news reports, they shrunk back and stopped talking about the matter. But crimes cannot be concealed by silence. In the recent United Nations Security Council, Soviet representative Malik sternly condemned the germ warfare crimes of the American aggressors. This forced US representative Gross and the reactionary American newspapers to come out and make shameless defenses of Quinn and Enoch's confessions, because the confessions of these two men are one of the most important pieces of evidence of US imperialism's use of bacteriological weapons. But the Gross clique clearly not only failed to achieve their goal, but instead, in their attempt to cover up the truth, proved that the various situations of the American aggressors' germ warfare confessed by Quinn and Enoch are completely true.

Gross's lying skills are certainly no better than Acheson's, so when he denied the crime of germ warfare at the Security Council on July 1, he similarly dared not face the various facts provided by Quinn and Enoch, but could only indirectly say that the confessions of the two American prisoners were "written by people unfamiliar with English." But these evasive words could not save Mr. Gross from his predicament. Even in the United States, many people believe that Gross's argument is untenable. Dean, a columnist for the American "Compass Daily", refuted Gross's nonsense on July 5. Dean said that after carefully studying the full text of Quinn and Enoch's confessions and photographic copies of the confessions, many facts were discovered that "Gross may have decided could not strengthen his argument."

Dean pointed out that Enoch's two statements "are both written in pure, vernacular, American-style English"; Quinn's statement has many spelling errors, and his English is somewhat rough in many places, but "none of the errors are 'non-American'." In addition, Dean also pointed out, "The Communists are very clear about Quinn's poor English and express regret for it. The introduction to the confession is written in elegant English, and the conclusion says, 'The characteristics of style, spelling and punctuation have been preserved as they are.'" Gross's lies, which cannot stand the test of facts, cannot even deceive Americans, so who can they deceive? It is therefore not difficult to understand why, at the International Red Cross Conference in Toronto, those who controlled the conference under the manipulation of the United States refused to allow the Chinese delegation to exhibit the audio recordings of Quinn and Enoch's confessions and other evidence of germ warfare at the conference.

Russell, a reporter for the New York "World-Telegram and Sun", was obviously bolder than Acheson and Gross, and he actually attempted to overturn some of the specific facts in Quinn and Enoch's confessions. But his clumsy methods only confirmed these facts. The July 16 issue of the "World-Telegram and Sun" published Russell's dispatch from Tokyo, saying that he had reviewed Quinn and Enoch's letters, confessions, and broadcast speeches at the headquarters of the US Fifth Air Force and the headquarters of the Third Bombardment Group. As a result of the review, Russell admitted that Quinn and Enoch's "handwriting seems to be genuine." Russell avoided talking about the large number of facts provided by Quinn and Enoch in their confessions, and only dared to quibble on two points. First, Enoch confessed that in August 1951, he had attended a secret class on germ warfare at the Iwakuni Ground School in Japan, and the lecturer's name was Wilson. According to Russell, no one named Wilson had ever lectured at Iwakuni, but a man named Pearson was the head of the school. Second, records show that Quinn and Enoch did sortie on the nights they said they did, but they did not report any "unexploded bombs" afterwards.

Russell's quibbles cannot withstand a real audit. Wilson and Pearson differ by only the first letter, it is possible that Enoch misheard, because he only attended one such class, or it may just be Russell playing tricks there; but there really is such a person, this is what Russell has already confirmed. Although Russell said that Pearson did not give a class on germ warfare, he admitted that there was a class on "defense against germ warfare" at this school. Everyone knows that the so-called "defense" in the mouths of the US imperialists is actually a synonym for aggression, and besides the imperialist group headed by the United States, there is simply no civilized country in the world that is preparing or conducting germ warfare. Therefore, Russell here just confirmed Enoch's confession. As for Russell saying that Quinn and Enoch did not report "unexploded bomb situations," this is completely shameless lying. The two of them even drew the shape of the unexploded bombs, and wrote in detail how the bombs spread bacteria and insects. Why doesn't Russell dare to answer these? The ability of the American aggressors to forge evidence and conceal their crimes has long been notorious, although the clumsiness of their tricks is also world-renowned.

### 葛罗斯之流的狡辩谎言矛盾百出  美国抵赖进行细菌战罪行的企图彻底破产

    葛罗斯之流的狡辩谎言矛盾百出
    美国抵赖进行细菌战罪行的企图彻底破产
    【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】自从被朝中人民军队俘获的美国空军人员奎恩和伊纳克供述了他们亲身投掷细菌弹的经过以后，对全人类犯了空前严重罪行的美国侵略者一直陷于狼狈不堪的境地。无论是美国国务卿艾奇逊，无论是美国的通讯社，都不敢对奎恩和伊纳克供词中的具体事实有所声辩。他们在发表了一两篇矛盾百出的声明和狡赖的新闻以后，就缩起头来绝口不谈这件事情。但是罪行是不能用缄默掩饰过去的。在最近联合国安全理事会上，苏联代表马立克严词斥责了美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行。这就迫使美国代表葛罗斯和美国的反动报纸不得不出来对奎恩和伊纳克的供词作无耻的声辩，因为这两个人的供词是美帝国主义使用细菌武器的最重要的证据之一。但是葛罗斯之流显然不但没有达到他们的目的，却反而欲盖弥彰地证明了奎恩和伊纳克所供述的美国侵略者进行细菌战的种种情形是完全真实的。
    葛罗斯的说谎本领当然超不过艾奇逊，因此他在七月一日安全理事会上抵赖进行细菌战的罪行时，同样不敢正视奎恩和伊纳克所提供的种种事实，而只能旁敲侧击地说，这两个美国俘虏的供词是“不熟悉英文的人写的”。但是这些躲躲闪闪的话并不能把葛罗斯先生救出窘境。就是在美国，许多人也认为葛罗斯的论点是不能成立的。美国“指南针日报”专栏作家狄恩在七月五日就驳斥了葛罗斯的这种信口胡说。狄恩说，把奎恩和伊纳克的供词全文及供词的照相副本仔细地加以研究以后，发现了许多事实，“葛罗斯可能决定，这些事实是不能加强他的论点的”。
    狄恩指出，伊纳克的两个声明“都是以纯粹的、土语的、在美国习用的英文写出来的”；奎恩的声明中有很多拼错字的地方，其英文有许多地方是有些粗糙的，但“错误中没有一个是‘非美国’的”。此外，狄恩还指出，“共产党人对于奎恩的拙劣的英文是很清楚的，并且对它表示遗憾。供词的介绍前言是以优美的英文写出的，其结语说，‘文体、字的拼法及标点符号的特质已照原样保留’。”经不起事实考验的葛罗斯的谎话，连美国人也欺骗不了，还能欺骗谁呢？人们因此也就不难理解，在多伦多的国际红十字大会上，美国操纵下的把持大会的那些人，为什么不肯让中国代表团把奎恩和伊纳克的供词录音以及其他细菌战证据在大会上展览了。
    纽约“世界电讯与太阳报”的记者罗塞尔显然比艾奇逊和葛罗斯要大胆些，他居然企图推翻奎恩和伊纳克供词中的某些具体事实。但是他的拙劣手段反而证实了这些事实。七月十六日的“世界电讯与太阳报”刊载罗塞尔的东京电说，他在美国第五航空队总部和第三轰炸机大队总部审核了奎恩和伊纳克的信件、供词和广播词。审核的结果，罗塞尔承认，奎恩和伊纳克的“笔迹似乎是真的”。罗塞尔对于奎恩和伊纳克在供词中提供的大量事实避而不谈，只敢在两点上进行诡辩。第一，伊纳克供称，他在一九五一年八月曾在日本岩国地面学校听过一堂关于细菌战的秘密课程，授课的人名叫威尔逊。据罗塞尔说，从来没有一个名叫威尔逊的人曾在岩国讲过课，但是有一个名叫皮尔逊的是该校的负责人。第二，记录显示奎恩和伊纳克在他们所说的那几天晚上确曾出击，但他们事后没有报告过关于“不爆炸的炸弹”的情况。
    罗塞尔的诡辩是经不起真正的审核的。威尔逊（Wilson）和皮尔逊（Bilson），只差了第一个字母，可能是伊纳克听错了，因为他只上过这么一堂课，也可能只是罗塞尔在那里故弄玄虚；但是的确有这么一个人，这是罗塞尔已经肯定的了。尽管罗塞尔说皮尔逊没有讲过关于细菌战的课，但是他承认在这个学校里有关于“细菌战的防御”的课。谁都知道，美帝国主义者口中的所谓“防御”实际上就是侵略的代名词，何况在世界上除了以美国为首的帝国主义集团而外，根本就没有一个文明国在准备或进行细菌战。因此罗塞尔在这里恰好证实了伊纳克的供词。至于罗塞尔说奎恩和伊纳克没有报告“不爆炸的炸弹的情况”，这完全是无耻撒谎。他们两人连不爆炸的炸弹的形状都画出来了，炸弹如何散放细菌和昆虫也详细地写出来了。罗塞尔为什么不敢答复这些呢？美国侵略者伪造证据、掩饰罪迹的本领是早就臭名远扬了的，虽然他们伎俩的拙劣也是举世闻名的。
