    Dingxian Special District Cooperative in Hebei Province is improving its business operations by publicly disclosing costs from top to bottom and studying and determining reasonable prices, which has strengthened the relationship between higher and lower level cooperatives and enabled the rapid development of the cooperatives' business and organization.
    In the past, cooperatives at all levels in Dingxian Special District had a purely profit-oriented view in their business operations, which was specifically reflected in the county cooperatives seeking excessive profits and setting excessively high prices when supplying materials to the primary cooperatives. A prominent example is the "Liangong" brand men's socks operated by Wuji County Cooperative, which had a purchase cost of 61,200 yuan per dozen, but were allocated to the primary cooperatives at a price of 79,000 yuan per dozen, with a gross profit as high as 22 percent. Xinle County Cooperative earned 487 yuan per jin of kerosene allocated to the primary cooperatives, with a gross profit of more than 17 percent. Therefore, the selling price of goods in primary cooperatives was often higher than the local market price. In this case, in order to meet the needs of its members, the primary cooperatives were unwilling to purchase goods from the higher-level cooperatives and instead purchased them directly from other places. The same situation also existed between county cooperatives and special district cooperatives. This caused dissatisfaction among members with the primary cooperatives and lower-level cooperatives with the higher-level cooperatives, and the business of the cooperatives at all levels became sluggish.
    In order to change this situation, the Dingxian Special District Cooperative Federation convened a meeting of the heads of the planning and finance sections of each county cooperative to publicly disclose the costs of new and old commodities of the special district cooperative. After evaluation, reasonable prices were set for the first batch of 20 commodities, so that the average sales profit was reduced from about 2 percent to about 1 percent. Then, a second commodity evaluation was carried out to gradually make commodity prices fair and reasonable.
    Since the implementation of public cost disclosure and reasonable evaluation, the sales volume of cooperatives at all levels in Dingxian Special District has rapidly increased in a straight line. For example, the sales volume of the special district cooperative in May was 4.5 billion yuan, but in the 25 days after the June evaluation, it increased to more than 6.75 billion yuan, and the goods that had been backlogged in the warehouse for more than eight months were sold out. County cooperatives and other units also adopted this method, and achieved good results. For example, the sales volume of Quyang County Cooperative increased five times compared with before. The phenomenon that county cooperatives could not sell goods and primary cooperatives purchased goods from outside is no longer exist.
    Through this public cost disclosure and reasonable price determination, the enthusiasm of the members has been greatly promoted, and the organization of the cooperative has been expanded. In the 22 days after the evaluation, the Chengnan United Village Cooperative in Quyang County developed 8,664 members. In the past, the masses in Dongguantou Village were unwilling to join the Yanzhao Town Cooperative, but after the cooperative publicly disclosed its costs and reasonably evaluated prices, it absorbed 116 members in just three afternoons.
    The public cost disclosure and reasonable price determination of cooperatives must be carried out in a planned and prepared manner. In advance, in-depth education work should be carried out among the members to make them realize that the cooperative is their own economic organization. On the one hand, it should be explained that the cooperative's excessive pursuit of profits is wrong, and on the other hand, it should be made clear to the members that if the cooperative does not obtain reasonable profits, it cannot accumulate funds to better serve the members. Before determining the selling price, the source, brand, original price and various expenses of the goods should be compared with the market and company prices, and samples should be displayed for everyone to visit. Only in this way can the expected results be achieved.

    定县专区合作社逐级公开成本改进业务
    河北省定县专区合作社改进业务经营，由上而下的公开成本并研究确定合理价格，密切了上下级合作社的关系，使合作社的业务与组织得到迅速的发展。
    定县专区各级合作社过去在业务上是存在着单纯营利观点的，这具体表现在县社供应基层社物资时看利过多，定价过高。较突出的例子如无极县社经营的练工牌男袜，进货成本每打价六万一千二百元，拨给基层社时每打价七万九千元，毛利高达百分之二十二；新乐县社拨给基层社的煤油每斤赚四百八十七元，毛利也在百分之十七以上；因此，基层社货物的售价往往高于当地市价。在这种情况下，基层社为了供应社员需要，就不愿由上级社进货而迳向外地采购。同样的情况在县社和专区社之间也存在着。这就造成了社员对基层社、下级社对上级社的不满，各级社业务亦呈现冷落现象。
    定县专区合作总社为了改变这一情况召集各县社计划、财务科长开会，把专区社新旧商品成本公开，经过评定，订出了首批二十种商品的合理价格，使销货利润平均由百分之二左右降为百分之一左右。接着又进行了第二次商品的评价，使商品价格逐渐趋于公平合理。
    定县专区各级合作社自实行了公开成本并合理评价后，销货额迅速直线上升，例如专区社五月份销货额为四十五亿元，而在六月份评价后二十五天时间内，即增至六十七亿五千多万元，并且销出了积压在仓库里八个多月的货物。各县社等也采用这一办法，同样收到很好效果。如曲阳县社销货额较前增加五倍。以前县社进货销不了、基层社向外采购的现象已不复存在。
    通过这次公开成本、合理确定价格，大大发扬了社员的积极性，扩大了合作社组织。曲阳城北联村社评价后二十二天里就发展社员八千六百六十四名，东管头村群众过去不愿加入燕赵镇合作社，但该社公开成本、合理评定价格后，仅三个晌午的时间即吸收社员一百一十六名。
    合作社公开成本、合理评定价格，必须有计划有准备地进行。事先应向社员进行深入的教育工作，使社员认清合作社是社员自己的经济组织，一方面说明合作社过高的追求利润是不对的，另一方面要向社员讲清楚合作社如果得不到合理利润，也不能积累资金而更好地为社员服务。在确定售价前，要将货物来路、牌号、原价以及各项开支初拟草价与市场及公司价格加以比较，并陈列样品供大家参观。这样进行起来才能收到预期效果。
