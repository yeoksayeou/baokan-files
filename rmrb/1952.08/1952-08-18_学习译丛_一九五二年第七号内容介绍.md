The main contents of "Study Translation Series" No. 7, 1952, include Andrei Yefimov's "The Role of Practice in the Process of Cognition," Slepov's "On the Bolshevik Style in Party Work," Berov's "On the Interrelation of Economics and Politics," and the editorial from the Bolshevik magazine, issue No. 12, 1952, "Continuously Improve the Work of Selecting and Allocating Cadres," among other articles. Andrei Yefimov's article is helpful for comrades studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice." Slepov's article profoundly points out that the combination of revolutionary spirit and a pragmatic approach, a high degree of principle, strict criticism and self-criticism, and a keen sense and foresight for new things are the most important characteristics of the Bolshevik work style. The author also points out that studying theory and Party history, and expanding one's ideological and cultural horizons, are essential conditions for mastering the Leninist-Stalinist work style. Berov's paper analyzes in detail the interrelation of economics and politics in Marxist-Leninist social science, pointing out that understanding these issues can help us solve many complex problems of economic construction. The editorial from the Bolshevik magazine was excerpted and published in the People's Daily on August 3rd; the full text is published here. In addition, this issue also continues the fourth and fifth sections of Rosenthal's "Development is the Struggle of Opposites." These two sections mainly clarify antagonistic contradictions and the methods for overcoming them, as well as non-antagonistic contradictions and their social essence. Finally, there are some explanations of philosophical terms.

    “学习译丛”一九五二年第七号的主要内容，有安得列也夫的“实践在认识过程中的作用”，斯列波夫的“论党工作中的布尔什维克作风”，伯洛夫的“论经济与政治的相互关系”和布尔什维克杂志一九五二年第十二期的社论“要不断改进挑选和配备干部的工作”等文。安得列也夫的文章，对学习毛主席“实践论”的同志是有帮助的。斯列波夫的文章深刻地指出革命魄力与求实精神的结合，高度的原则性，严格的批评和自我批评，对新鲜事物的锐敏感觉和预见性，是布尔什维克工作作风的最重要的特点。作者同时指出，研究理论和党史，扩大自己的思想和文化的视野，是掌握列宁斯大林工作作风的必备条件。伯洛夫的论文详细地分析了马克思列宁主义社会科学中经济和政治的相互关系问题，指出理解这些问题，可以帮助我们解决许多经济建设的复杂问题。布尔什维克杂志的社论，在八月三日的人民日报上已摘要刊载，这里发表的是全文。此外，本期还续载了罗森塔尔的“发展即对立的斗争”一文中的四、五节。这两节主要阐明了对抗性的矛盾及其克服的方法和非对抗性的矛盾及其社会本质。最后，有若干哲学名词解释。
