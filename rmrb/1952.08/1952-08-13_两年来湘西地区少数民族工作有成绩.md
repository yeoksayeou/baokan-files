    Achievements in Ethnic Minority Work in Western Hunan in the Past Two Years
    In the past two years, ethnic minority work in the Xiangxi (Western Hunan) region has made achievements. The Xiangxi region includes twenty-two counties in western Hunan, with a population of about three million, and is a place where Han, Miao, Dong, and other ethnic groups live together in high mountains and ridges. Before liberation, bandits haunted the area, feudal exploitation and ethnic segregation were extremely serious, and the lives of all ethnic groups were very difficult. After the liberation of Xiangxi counties in the second half of 1949, the local people's governments and the Chinese Communist Party organizations implemented the ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program, and the face of Xiangxi has been fundamentally changed in the past two years.
    The banditry, which was a special disaster for the people of Xiangxi for hundreds of years, has been eliminated under the leadership of the people's government and the People's Liberation Army and with the cooperation and support of the Miao and Han people. The lives of all ethnic groups have been unprecedentedly stabilized. With the unanimous consent and request of the people of all ethnic groups, the people's government has led the Miao and Han people in opposing bullies, reducing rent, and carrying out land reform in 347 townships in Yongshun, Fenghuang, Qiancheng, Luxi, Guzhang, and Baojing counties, where the Miao people live in concentrated communities or mixed with the Han people. In these areas, accounting for 71% of the population and 72% of the land, land reform has been completed, ending the barbaric rule of feudal landlords. The people's government has also issued more than 9 million catties of grain as loans and relief grain and 1.5 billion yuan of various loans in ethnic minority areas, reduced the public grain levied on ethnic minority people, and implemented a preferential trade policy for ethnic minorities. As a result, the agricultural production of the Miao people increased by 20% last year compared with before liberation. The people's government has also correctly implemented ethnic trade and cooperation policies. In the previous year and last year, the people's government pre-purchased 50% of the local products in the ethnic minority areas of Xiangxi. Last year, the total purchase and sales volume of state-owned trade and cooperative departments in Xiangxi reached more than 70 billion yuan. According to statistics from seven counties inhabited or mixed with ethnic minorities, including Yongshun, Fenghuang, Qiancheng, Baojing, Guzhang, Tongdao, and Huarong, the total value of local products produced last year was more than 100 billion yuan, of which 50 billion yuan was transported and sold by trade and cooperation departments, and another 40 billion yuan in the first half of this year. The people's government has also supplied the local people with large quantities of materials such as salt, homespun cloth, and grain. The unreasonable price differences between industrial and agricultural products have been greatly reduced. For example, before liberation, every 100 catties of gallnut in Xiangxi could only be exchanged for 22 catties and 13 taels of salt, but now it can be exchanged for 76 catties and 13 taels. Due to the recovery of production and the export of local products, the overall purchasing power of the ethnic minorities in Xiangxi has now exceeded about 25% before liberation. Cultural and health work among ethnic minorities in Xiangxi has also been greatly improved. Taking Qiancheng County, where the Miao people live in concentrated communities, as an example, compared with before liberation, the number of central primary schools in the county has increased from one to three, the number of students has increased from 46 to 375, the number of village primary schools has increased from 23 to 47, and the number of students has increased from 390 to 3,264. Before liberation, there was not a single workers' and peasants' night school in the entire district, but now Qiancheng County alone has 1,984 night school students. The provincial No. 13 Middle School, formerly located in Xiangxi, has been changed to a national middle school, and the Chadong Normal School has also been changed to a national normal school. After liberation, the people's government implemented a health policy focusing on prevention, universally carried out health propaganda among the Miao people, and organized mobile medical teams. Now it has begun to train Miao medical personnel and midwives, and is preparing to strengthen and expand health and medical institutions at all levels.
    Due to the achievements of the above-mentioned work, the political consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups has also been unprecedentedly improved, and the relationship between the Miao and Han people has also been improved. In the past two years, the Miao and Han people have not only united in various struggles such as suppressing bandits, opposing bullies, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and land reform, but also begun to cooperate and help each other in production and life. In many places, Miao and Han agricultural production mutual aid groups have been established, and Miao and Han supply and marketing cooperatives have been established. Due to the increased awareness of the people of all ethnic groups, the people's government has also cultivated and promoted a large number of Miao cadres and activists to engage in leadership work in various tasks. Therefore, it has laid a good foundation for the establishment of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region People's Government this time.

### 两年来湘西地区少数民族工作有成绩

    两年来湘西地区少数民族工作有成绩
    两年多来湘西地区少数民族工作有成绩。湘西地区包括湖南西部二十二个县，人口约三百万人，是一个高山峻岭，汉、苗、侗等各族人民聚居的地方。解放前，这里土匪出没，封建剥削和民族隔阂异常严重，各族人民生活均极困苦。一九四九年下半年湘西各县相继解放后，当地人民政府与中国共产党组织执行了共同纲领规定的民族政策，两年多来已根本改变了湘西的面貌。
    作为湘西人民数百年特别灾难的匪患，在人民政府人民解放军领导人民扑剿和苗、汉人民合作支援下已经肃清，各族人民生活得到空前安定。人民政府在各族人民一致同意和要求下，两年多来领导苗汉人民进行了反对恶霸、减租和土地改革等运动，在永绥、凤凰、干城、泸溪、古丈、保靖各县苗族聚居与苗汉杂居共三百四十七个乡中，占人口百分之七十一与占土地百分之七十二的地区，完成了土地改革，结束了各该地区封建地主的野蛮统治。人民政府又在少数民族地区发放了九百余万斤稻谷的贷粮与救济粮和十五亿元的各种贷款，减征了少数民族人民的公粮，实行了优待少数民族的贸易政策，因此苗族人民的农业生产去年就较解放前增加了百分之二十。人民政府也正确地执行了民族贸易、合作政策。前年、去年人民政府在湘西少数民族地区预购了当地土产百分之五十，去年湘西地区国营贸易、合作部门购销总额即达七百亿元以上。据永绥、凤凰、干城、保靖、古丈、通道、晃县七个少数民族聚居或杂居县统计，去年生产土产总值在一千亿元以上，经贸易、合作部门运销出去的即达五百亿元，今年上半年又达四百亿元。人民政府并大量供应了当地人民以食盐、土布、粮食等物资。工农产品的不合理差价因此大大缩小，如解放前湘西每百斤五棓子只能换二十二斤十三两食盐，现在已能换七十六斤十三两了。由于生产的恢复与土产的外销，目前湘西少数民族人民总的购买力已超过解放前百分之二十五左右。湘西少数民族的文化、卫生工作也大有改进。以苗族聚居的干城县解放前和目前比较为例，全县中心小学由一所增至三所，学生由四十六人增至三百七十五人，村小学校由二十三所增至四十七所，学生由三百九十人增至三千二百六十四人。全区在解放前没有一所工农夜校，现仅干城县即有夜校学员一千九百八十四人。过去设在湘西的省立十三中学已改为民族中学，茶洞师范学校也改为民族师范学校。解放后人民政府执行了以预防为主的卫生工作方针，普遍在苗族人民中进行了卫生宣传工作，组织了巡回医疗队，现并开始进行培养苗族医务人员、助产士，准备加强与扩大各级卫生、医疗机构等工作。
    由于上述各项工作取得了成绩，各族人民的政治觉悟也空前提高，苗、汉两族人民的关系也已改善。两年多来，苗汉人民不仅在剿匪、反对恶霸、镇压反革命、抗美援朝与土地改革等各种斗争中团结一致，在生产与生活中也开始做到互助合作，不少地方已成立了苗汉农业生产互助组，建立了苗汉供销合作社。由于各族人民觉悟的提高，人民政府在各项工作中，又培养、提拔了大批苗族干部和积极分子从事领导工作，因此就为这次湘西苗族自治区人民政府的成立打下了良好的基础。（新华社）
