    Changqing County People's Government Begins to Value the Handling of People's Letters

    Editor: After the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" column published my letter "Suggestion to the Changqing County People's Government to Inspect the Handling of People's Letters" on July 17th, the leadership of the Changqing County People's Government has conducted an inspection and convened a special meeting to study the handling of people's letters.

    During the inspection, the main reasons for the backlog of people's letters in the Changqing County People's Government in the past were identified: (1) The mass viewpoint of leading cadres was weak, they did not study the instructions from higher authorities sufficiently, and they did not attach importance to the handling of people's letters; (2) There was a lack of necessary working systems, no one was specifically assigned to be in charge of this work, and no education was given to cadres on the importance of handling people's letters. At the meeting, a work plan for handling people's letters was formulated: 1. Assign a specific person to be responsible for the work of handling people's letters and receiving people's visits, and establish various systems such as registration, research, transfer, follow-up, and archiving; 2. In the event of important issues, the leadership will personally take charge of the handling, and the letters transferred to various districts for handling should be inspected and followed up in a timely manner; 3. Educate cadres to attach importance to the work of handling people's letters and receiving visits from the masses; 4. Establish various systems from top to bottom, and make the handling of people's letters and receiving visits from the masses one of the daily tasks of the county and district people's governments. It was also decided to inspect and handle the backlog of people's letters. In addition, the Changqing County People's Government also instructed the people's governments of various districts to attach importance to the handling of people's letters and receiving visits from the masses.

    I think it is very good that the Changqing County People's Government accepts readers' suggestions to improve its work in this way.

    长清县人民政府开始重视处理人民来信的工作
    编辑同志：七月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载了我写的“建议长清县人民政府检查对人民来信的处理情况”一信后，长清县人民政府领导方面已经作了检查，并召开了专门会议，研究处理人民来信的工作。
    在检查中，找出了长清县人民政府过去积压人民来信的主要原因：（一）领导干部的群众观念薄弱，对上级的指示学习得不够，没有重视处理人民来信工作；（二）缺乏必要的工作制度，并且没有设专人负责掌管这一工作，也没有对干部进行重视处理人民来信工作的教育。在会议上，制定了处理人民来信的工作计划：一、对处理人民来信和接见人民来访的工作，指定专人负责，并建立登记、研究、转办、催办、存档等各项制度；二、遇有重要问题，由领导方面亲自掌握处理，对转各区承办的信件，要及时地检查、催办；三、教育干部重视处理人民来信和接见群众来访的工作；四、从上而下地建立各种制度，把处理人民来信和接见群众来访作为县、区人民政府的日常工作之一。并决定将所积压的人民来信进行检查、处理。此外，长清县人民政府并指示各区人民政府重视处理人民来信和接见人民来访的工作。
    我认为长清县人民政府这样地接受读者建议改进工作是很好的。
