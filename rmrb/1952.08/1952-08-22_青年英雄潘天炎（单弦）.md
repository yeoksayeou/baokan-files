Young Hero Pan Tianyan (Danzian)
Du Peng, Mei Menzhao Collaboration

(Overture):
The hero steadfastly defends Top Cover Mountain, with wisdom and courage. Blocking the enemy, he stands alone. Now his heroic deeds are spreading everywhere.

(Number Chant):
The heroic troops of the Volunteer Army, Second Battalion, Sixth Company; there is a young soldier named Pan Tianyan. He is only eighteen years old this year and is a member of the Youth League. He single-handedly, in the Fourth Battle, bravely defended Top Cover Mountain, repelling the enemy's nine assaults, making the enemy soldiers tremble with fear. He stubbornly defended and made two great achievements, wearing his military medal on his chest.

(Peaceful Years):
Before singing about the hero, let me first talk about Top Cover Mountain: there is a highway and several civilian houses at the foot of the mountain, and the enemy soldiers gather here every day, using it as a resting place, plotting to capture this mountain. Our Sixth Company received orders to defend the top of the mountain. Pan Tianyan, the squad leader, and the deputy squad leader, the three of them are steadfast in the forefront. The right side of the position is the main position of the company, and the left side is a cliff with a deep ravine. The squad leader took a machine gun to the rear to provide fire support. The enemy below the mountain climbed up the mountain for the fifth time. The deputy squad leader said: "Keep calm and wait for them to get close!" When they were about ten meters away, "One, two," with a "swish," a row of grenades. Pan Tianyan said: "Sorry, we don't have anything good to eat, so here are some iron eggs with handles for your breakfast." The enemy rolled down, head over heels. The squad leader said: "He enjoyed this breakfast." Xiao Pan said: "Let him never eat again from now on. American devils, sleep well! Never suffer from insomnia." The enemy soldiers got anxious and bombarded the mountain with artillery fire; smoke and dust rose from the top of the mountain, and flames flew up. The deputy squad leader was seriously injured and had to leave the front line. The squad leader took on the task of the deputy squad leader. The squad leader smiled and called out to Tianyan: "The enemy will definitely attack the mountain again. The company has ordered us to try our best to hold out until 4:30 in the afternoon. The main force of the company is preparing to counterattack, and we must buy time." Xiao Pan was wiping his gun and said with a smile: "I have kept the pre-war determination in mind. I will definitely listen to your command, learn from your experience as a good Communist Party member, and strive to make contributions in battle to avenge the deputy squad leader." The enemy soldiers finished the artillery barrage and attacked the mountain again. This time, they divided into two routes to form a pincer attack. Pan Tianyan first discovered this on the mountain and came up with a plan. He suggested that the squad leader do this and that, tying six grenades together and burying them in front of the fortifications, connecting the iron rings to a broken wire he had picked up, and then taking off his hat and placing it on top. All preparations were completed. He held the wire and hid behind a large blue stone. After a while, the attacking enemy cautiously poked his head out in front of the mountain. He saw a hat on our position and pondered for a long time. The enemy soldiers thought for a long time, and their hearts were filled with joy, "Oh! There's no one on this mountain! We will definitely take this mountain this time." With a whoosh, a swarm of them surrounded a large area. The squad leader said, "Pull it," Pan Tianyan pulled the rope, and said, "This is our military position, no tours allowed." With a "boom," the enemy was blown over. Those still alive were trying to climb up. The squad leader fired his gun and four or five more enemy soldiers rolled down. Suddenly, the enemy threw a grenade, and the squad leader gloriously sacrificed on the mountain. Xiao Pan's eyes filled with tears, and anger surged into the sky. The fire of revenge burned in his heart. He clenched his gun and vowed to the squad leader: "American devils, even if there is only me, I will never let you live."

(Jinqian Lianhualuo):
After repelling another enemy assault, Pan Tianyan thought to himself that the enemy soldiers would probably bombard the mountain with artillery fire again. Take this opportunity to tidy up the fortifications and check if the weapons are complete. Ah! The carbine only has one bullet left. It doesn't matter, I'll use these grenades to drive the enemy down the mountain. The right side is the company's main position, and the squad leader's machine gun will also provide fire support. Thinking of this, the determination to avenge is even greater. I will never forget my determination to strive to become a Communist Party member. For a long time, the enemy's position had not shelled. Eh! The enemy soldiers are probably up to some trick again. He hurriedly stuck his head out and looked around carefully. It turned out that six devils were sneaking up the mountain. He saw a machine gun with two gunners and four devils holding rifles ambushing on both sides. When Pan Tianyan saw this situation, he pretended to shout, "Comrades! The enemy is coming up, prepare the grenades!" He kept shouting, taking this opportunity to jump out of the fortifications and quietly detour behind the enemy, making a left turn. The six enemy soldiers heard someone shouting on our position. They thought that it must be the commander of the Volunteer Army. Fearing that we would give them a round of grenades, they quickly aimed at our fortifications and hurriedly fired back. While shooting, they shouted loudly. But they never expected two grenade explosions behind them, blowing up both the people and the guns. Six people died, and one stretched his legs and didn't move. Before they died, they complained about the American artillery, "Why don't you have eyes!" Little did they know that the one who took their lives was our hero Pan Tianyan.

(Qie Kuaishu):
The enemy below the mountain turned red-eyed and used the "sheep swarm" tactics to attack the mountain again. Pan Tianyan did not slack off when he saw this situation. He ran back to the fortifications and opened all the grenade covers, placing them by his side. At this time, the squad leader's machine gun fired continuously, and mortar shells from the right side exploded in the enemy's pile, igniting a fire. This firepower coordination beat the devils to a pulp, and some were still scurrying up. Just as I was saying this, the enemy soldiers were right in front of him. Pan Tianyan threw grenades one by one, and a dozen devils rolled down the mountain. Suddenly, the enemy threw a grenade, Pan Tianyan didn't hesitate, and kicked it back, exploding in the enemy's pile and emitting black smoke. Pan Tianyan ran out of the last grenade and used large stones as weapons to smash down the mountain in desperation. Taking advantage of the enemy's tumbling and chaos, Pan Tianyan pushed the last carbine bullet into the chamber. He thought to himself that no matter how dangerous this position is, I will definitely defend this mountain. He continued to chop down with large stones, smashing the enemy soldiers' heads and breaking their blood, and some of their heads were smashed into more than half. Although Pan Tianyan had used up all his grenades, the position on Top Cover Mountain was still as solid as iron.

(Liushui Ban):
Pan Tianyan's face was red and he was covered in sweat, watching the enemy soldiers roll down the mountain. The little hero looked back at the squad leader's body behind him, and the fire of revenge burned in his heart. He thought that this position was related to the overall situation, and it was most important to buy time. He must complete the task assigned to me by the higher authorities, defend the position, and buy time to eliminate the enemy. At this time, an enemy sneaked behind the hero, wanting to capture our young hero alive, thinking of going back to collect a reward. Pan Tianyan was calm, composed, resourceful, flexible, and not flustered. He had already seen through the enemy's trick, aimed the muzzle of the American carbine at the devil's chest, and pulled the bolt of the gun with his hand. Only heard a "click" sound, the enemy fell to the ground and lost his life, and saw two more waves of enemies rushing up the mountain. When Pan Tianyan saw this situation, he picked up the weapons from the enemy's dead body, determined to defend this mountain. At this time, he suddenly heard machine guns and artillery fire roaring behind him, and the shells burst into flowers in the enemy's pile, and the American devils were in chaos. It turned out that the time had come, and the entire company counterattacked and launched a battle of annihilation, eliminating the enemy attacking the mountain. The Top Cover Mountain position was as solid as Mount Tai. Pan Tianyan repelled the enemy's nine assaults, defended the position, and all the comrades in the company praised him. The military medal shone brightly on his chest. He is worthy of being a member of the Youth League, resolute, calm, and truly brave. He is truly resourceful, flexible, wise, and brave.

Note: This performance won the second prize in the literary and artistic competition of the "August 1st" Army Day Sports Meeting.

    青年英雄潘天炎（单弦）
    杜澎　梅门造合作
    （曲头）：
    英雄坚守在顶盖山，智勇双全。堵击敌人独挡一面。到现在他的英雄事迹到处流传。
    （数唱）：
    志愿军英雄部队，二营六连；有位青年战士，姓潘叫天炎。今年才一十八岁，是一个青年团员。他一个人在四次战役，英勇坚守在顶盖山巅，打退了鬼子九次冲锋，鬼子兵胆战心寒。顽强守备立了两次大功，军功章佩带在胸前。
    （太平年）：
    未唱英雄，我先说这顶盖山：山下有一条公路和民房好几间，鬼子兵天天在这里集合，当成休息站，阴谋鬼计，想攻下这座山。咱六连接命令，守备在山巅，潘天炎小组长和副班长他们三个人坚守在最前沿，阵地的右侧是连的主阵地，左侧是悬崖大深涧，班长带一挺机枪在后面用火力来支援。山下的敌人，第五次爬上山，副班长说：“沉住气等他们到跟前！”等到还有十来米“一二”唰的一排手榴弹。潘天炎说：“对不起没啥好吃的，就这带把的铁蛋来给你们当早餐。”敌人滚下去，来了个脚朝天，小组长说：“这顿早餐他吃得挺解馋。”小潘说：“让他从今以后永远甭吃饭，美国鬼子好好地睡觉吧！永远不失眠。”鬼子兵急了眼，用大炮来轰山；山头上烟尘四起，飞起了大火团；副班长身负重伤，他只好下火线；小组长他把这副班长的任务来承担。小组长面带笑，叫一声天炎：“敌人一定又要来攻山，连里下过命令，要我们尽量守到下午四点半，连的主力准备反击，要我们争取时间。”小潘正擦枪，笑着发了言：“战前的决心我都记心间，一定听你的指挥，学习你好党员的战斗经验，在战斗中争取立功给副班长报仇冤。”鬼子兵排完大炮，又来攻山，这一次分成两路进攻形成个老虎钳。潘天炎在山头首先发现，想办法一计上心间。他建议小组长如此这般，把六个手榴弹捆在一起就埋在工事前，把铁环再接上一根拣来的破电线，然后他脱下帽子扣在上边。一切准备，都已做完，牵着电线隐蔽在一块大青石后边。呆不会攻山的敌人在山前把头探，他一看我们阵地上有一顶帽子他捉摸了老半天。鬼子兵想罢多时，心里怪喜欢，“噢！这山头没人啦！我们这回一定能拿下山。”呼啦啦一窝蜂就围过来一大片。小组长说：“拉”，潘天炎把绳一拉，他说：“这是我军阵地，谢绝参观。”轰?一声响，把鬼子都炸翻，有口气还在往上窜，小组长把枪猛打又有四五个鬼子滚下去了，忽然间，敌人扔过来一个手榴弹，小组长光荣牺牲就在山上边。小潘眼含泪，怒气冲天，复仇烈火滚滚烧心间，他握紧枪支向小组长发下誓愿：“美国鬼子别看只有我一个人也决不让你活命还。”
    （金钱莲花落）：
    打退了敌人冲锋又一遍，潘天炎他心暗想，鬼子兵大概又要用炮火来轰山。趁此机会咱把工事整理好，检查一下武器可齐全。呀！这卡宾枪只剩下一颗子弹，不要紧，就用这手榴弹也要把敌人打下山。这右侧是连的主阵地，班长的机枪也用火力来支援。想到此处复仇的决心更是大，忘不了决心争取作个共产党员。好半天敌人阵地还没排炮，咦！鬼子兵大概又在打什么鬼算盘。他急忙伸出头来四处留神看，原来是有六个鬼子偷偷摸摸地来攻山。但只见有一挺机枪两射手，四个鬼子手端步枪分别埋伏在两边。潘天炎一见这个情形，他假装的喊道：“同志们！敌人上来了，准备好手榴弹！”他这不住的连声喊，趁此机会他跳出了工事，悄悄的迂回到敌人的身后他来了个左转弯。这六个鬼子兵他听见我军阵地有人喊，他心想这一定是志愿军的指挥官。他害怕我们给他一顿手榴弹，赶紧对准咱的工事慌忙射击把枪还。一边打枪一边喊，他扯开嗓门叫了个欢。可没想到身后响了两声手榴弹，连人带枪都炸翻。六个人死去了两对半，剩下了一个他伸了伸腿就不动弹。他们在临死前都埋怨美国的炮兵“你怎么不长眼！”他哪里知道要他命的是咱们英雄潘天炎。
    （怯快书）：
    山下的敌人红了眼，羊群战术又来攻山。潘天炎见此情形不怠慢，跑回工事把所有的手榴弹盖一齐拧开放身边。这时间班长的机枪连声响，右侧打来的迫击炮弹也在敌人堆里爆炸起火烟。这火力配合把鬼子打的稀糊烂，剩下一些还在往上窜。我说时迟来那时快，这鬼子兵眼看到跟前。潘天炎把手榴弹一个一个往外打，十几个鬼子叽哩咕噜就滚下了山。忽然间敌人打过来一个手榴弹，潘天炎不怠慢，一脚踢回在敌人堆里爆炸冒了黑烟。潘天炎打完了最后一颗手榴弹，急中生智用大块石头当成武器砸下山。趁着敌人连滚带爬纷纷乱，潘天炎把最后一颗卡宾枪子弹推上拴。他心想任凭这阵地多危险，我一定守住这座山。继续用大块石头往下砍，只砸得那鬼子兵头破血流，也有的脑袋砸掉了多半边。潘天炎虽然用完了他所有的手榴弹，这顶盖山的阵地依然是铁石坚。
    （流水板）：
    潘天炎满脸通红浑身是汗，看敌兵纷纷滚下山。小英雄回头看小组长的尸体就在身后面，复仇烈火烧在心间。他想到这个阵地关系全盘争取时间最重要，一定要完成上级给我的任务坚守阵地争取时间把敌歼。这时间有一个敌人偷偷摸摸绕到英雄身背后，他想要活捉咱们的青年英雄，心想回去领赏钱。潘天炎沉着冷静机智灵活不慌不忙多勇敢，你看他早已看透敌人的诡计，用美式卡宾枪口对准鬼子的胸膛用手把枪机搬。只听得“卡”的一声那个敌人应声倒地一命丧，又只见两路敌人冲上山。潘天炎见此情形把敌人死尸身上武器拣，决心守住这座山。这时间忽听背后机枪炮火响成一片，你看那敌人堆中炮弹开花火光闪闪，美国鬼子乱成一团。原来是时机已到全连反击展开了一场歼灭战，消灭了攻山的敌人，顶盖山阵地犹如钢铁似泰山。潘天炎打退敌人九次冲锋坚守阵地全连同志都称赞，军功章金光闪闪挂在胸前。他不愧是个青年团员坚决沉着真勇敢，真正是机智灵活智勇双全。
