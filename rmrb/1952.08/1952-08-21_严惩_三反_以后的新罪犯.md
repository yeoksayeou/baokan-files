    Severely Punish New Criminals After the "Three-Anti" Campaign

    Comrade Editor: Zhao Qiming, an assistant at the Zhanggezhuang Joint Village Cooperative in Baxian County, Hebei Province, has been duly punished for continuing to embezzle after the "Three-Anti" campaign. Before the "Three-Anti" campaign, Zhao Qiming had serious bourgeois ideas and had committed robbery. After the "Three-Anti" campaign, he still did not want to turn over a new leaf. This summer, after the wheat harvest, the Zhanggezhuang Joint Village Cooperative purchased a large quantity of wheat. Zhao Qiming was responsible for issuing wheat purchase tickets during the purchase. On the morning of the thirteenth day of the fifth lunar leap month, Zhao Qiming took advantage of the lack of people and privately issued a wheat purchase ticket for 779 catties. The next day, he had his nephew take this purchase ticket to the cooperative's cash disbursement office to collect 794,600 yuan in Renminbi, which he then handed over to him. After this situation was discovered by the cooperative's inspector, Zhao was sent to the county people's court for handling. According to the spirit of "strict punishment from now on," the county people's court sentenced the offender to three years in prison and recovered all the embezzled money.

    We support this handling. In addition, we believe that the leading cadres of the cooperative have bureaucracy in the use of cadres, and there are also problems with the work system. We suggest that the cooperative conduct an in-depth inspection.

    严惩“三反”以后的新罪犯
    编辑同志：河北省霸县张各庄联村合作社协助员赵启明，因为在“三反”运动后仍然贪污，已受到应得的制裁。在“三反”运动前，赵启明便有严重的资产阶级思想，并有过抢劫行为。经过“三反”运动，他仍然不想痛改前非。今夏麦收后，张各庄联村合作社大量收购小麦。赵启明在收购中负责开购麦票。旧历闰五月十三日上午，赵启明趁人少的机会，私自开了一张七百七十九斤的购麦票，第二天就让他的侄子拿着这购麦票到该社兑款处取了人民币七十九万四千六百元，然后交给他。这一情况被该社检查员发觉后，赵犯即被送县人民法院处理。县人民法院根据“今后从严”的精神，判处该犯有期徒刑三年，追回全部赃款。
    我们拥护这样的处理。另外，我们认为该社领导干部在使用干部方面有官僚主义，工作制度也有问题。建议该社深入检查。
