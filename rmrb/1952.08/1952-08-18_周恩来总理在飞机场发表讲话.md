Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th—Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government delivered the following speech at the airport upon arriving in Moscow:
    Dear Comrades:
    I and the comrades of the delegation of the Government of the People’s Republic of China, under the instruction of Chairman Mao Zedong, feel greatly honored to come to Moscow.
    The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed between China and the Soviet Union in 1950 demonstrates the profound and unbreakable friendship between the people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. People can clearly see from the facts that this powerful and invincible alliance of ours has played an extremely important role in safeguarding peace and security in the Far East and the world.
    The Chinese people celebrate with the greatest enthusiasm and joy the brilliant victories achieved by our great ally, the Soviet Union, in its communist construction. The Chinese people deeply know that these victories not only belong to the Soviet people, but also to all peace-loving people in the world, because these victories greatly increase the strength to defend world peace.
    In the three years since the People's Republic of China overthrew foreign imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the efforts of the people throughout the country, and the enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet government and people, it has continuously overcome various domestic and foreign difficulties and has achieved significant achievements in all aspects of national construction. Today, on behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I would like to thank the Soviet government and people, under the leadership of Marshal Stalin, for the brotherly and selfless assistance they have given to the People's Republic of China.
    The delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China has come to Moscow this time to further strengthen the friendly cooperation between the two countries and to discuss various related issues. I am deeply convinced that the continued development of friendly cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union will inevitably make a greater contribution to the cause of peaceful construction of the people of China and the Soviet Union, as well as to the cause of peaceful construction of the people of the whole world.
    Long live the friendly alliance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live Comrade Stalin, the most sincere friend of the Chinese people and the great teacher of the working people of the world!

    周恩来总理在飞机场发表讲话
    【新华社莫斯科十七日电】中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理抵莫斯科时在飞机场上发表讲话如下：亲爱的同志们：
    我和中华人民共和国政府代表团诸同志，奉毛泽东主席之命，来到莫斯科，我们感到非常荣幸。
    中苏两国在一九五○年所签订的友好同盟互助条约，说明了中苏两大国人民的深厚的牢不可破的友谊。人们都能够从事实上看得很清楚，我们这个强大的不可战胜的同盟，对于保障远东及世界的和平与安全，起了极其伟大的作用。
    中国人民用最大的热情，欢欣庆祝我们伟大的盟友苏联在共产主义建设中所获得的辉煌的胜利。中国人民深深知道，这种胜利不仅是属于苏联人民的，而且是属于世界上一切爱好和平的人民的，因为这种胜利，大大地增加着保卫世界和平的力量。
    中华人民共和国在推翻外国帝国主义和国民党反动统治之后的三年时间中，由于中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导，由于全国人民的努力，又由于苏联政府和人民的热情援助，曾经不断地克服国内外的种种困难，业已在国家建设的各方面，获得了重大成就。今天我在这里代表毛泽东主席、中国政府和中国人民，感谢苏联政府和人民在斯大林大元帅领导之下对于中华人民共和国所作的兄弟般的大公无私的援助。
    中华人民共和国政府代表团这次来到莫斯科，是为了继续加强两国之间的友好合作，并商谈各种有关问题。我深信，中苏两大国的友好合作的继续发展，必然对于中苏两国人民的和平建设事业，以及对于全世界人民的和平建设事业，都将有更重大的贡献。
    中苏友好同盟合作万岁！
    中国人民的挚友、世界劳动人民的伟大导师斯大林同志万岁！
