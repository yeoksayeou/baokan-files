    Only with Leadership Attention Can Reading and Studying the Newspaper Be Done Well
    Editor,

    Recently we inspected the reading and studying of newspapers in some organizations and schools in Zhengzhou City. The results of reading and studying newspapers were better in mass organizations, followed by schools, and worst in economic enterprises and hospitals.

    In all units where reading and studying newspapers was better, leading cadres attached importance to current affairs study, the political atmosphere in the organizations was relatively strong, and cadres had a clearer understanding of international and domestic events and certain important policies. The Municipal Telecommunications Bureau is an example. The bureau has a total of 518 people, subscribed to 79 newspapers, and organized 29 reading groups. The reading and study of newspapers by employees is carried out in an organized and led manner. They read the newspaper collectively every day, and more than 70% of the people can often automatically read the newspaper. At the beginning of the "Three-Anti" movement, some embezzlers had many ideological concerns and dared not confess their problems. After repeated reading and study of the newspaper, they understood the policies and finally boldly confessed their mistakes. In this way, reading and studying the newspaper promoted practical work.

    However, most organizations in Zhengzhou City do not pay attention to reading and studying the newspaper. In these organizations, the tendency to ignore politics has reached an intolerable point. In the Municipal Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, 55% of the cadres do not read newspapers regularly or do not read newspapers at all. In the First Branch of the Municipal Hospital, 73% of the staff do not read newspapers at all, and a few people occasionally look at the headlines. When the "Five-Anti" movement in Zhengzhou City was nearing its end, many cadres still believed that "the 'Five-Anti' movement was carried out to quickly move towards socialism." Among the 38 cadres in the First Branch of the Municipal Hospital, only two knew the content of the "Five-Anti" movement and the classification standards of industrial and commercial households.

    The reason why these cadres in the organizations do not pay attention to reading the newspaper is inseparable from the erroneous thinking of the leading cadres. Some leading cadres simply emphasize professional work and neglect to educate and improve cadres politically and ideologically, and even regard reading the newspaper as something that contradicts work. When we inspected the reading situation, some leading cadres also said: "We are not political organizations, why come to test our reading situation." This shows how serious their purely professional viewpoint has become. In order to correct the above phenomenon, we have issued a circular requiring party organizations at all levels to make full use of newspapers to strengthen the political and ideological education of staff, and to seriously check the reading and study of newspapers in their units and formulate practical and effective improvement methods.

### 领导干部重视才能搞好读报学习

    领导干部重视才能搞好读报学习
    编辑同志：最近我们检查了郑州市部分机关、学校读报学习的情况。读报学习的成绩以群众团体较好，学校次之，经济企业部门和医院最差。
    在所有读报学习较好的单位，领导干部重视时事学习，机关政治空气比较浓厚，干部对国际、国内大事和某些重要政策都有比较清楚的认识。市电信局就是一个例子。该局共有五百一十八人，订了七十九份报纸，组织了二十九个读报组。职工的读报学习是有组织有领导地进行的。他们每日集体读报，百分之七十以上的人都能经常自动地阅读报纸。“三反”运动开始时，有些贪污分子思想顾虑很多，不敢交代问题。他们经过了反复的读报学习，了解了政策，终于大胆地坦白了自己的错误。读报学习就这样推动了实际工作。
    但是，郑州市大部分机关对于读报学习是不重视的。在这些机关中，忽视政治的倾向已经到了不可容忍的地步。市花纱布公司有百分之五十五的干部不经常看报或根本不看报，市立医院第一分院有百分之七十三的工作人员根本不看报，个别人偶尔看一下大标题。在郑州市“五反”运动将近结束的时候，很多干部还认为“进行‘五反’是为了很快地走向社会主义”。市立医院第一分院三十八个干部中，只有两人知道“五反”运动的内容及工商户的分类标准。
    这些机关干部不重视读报的原因，和领导干部的错误思想是分不开的。有些领导干部单纯强调业务工作，忽视从政治思想上去教育和提高干部，竟把读报看成是和工作相矛盾的事情。当我们检查读报情况时，有的领导干部还说：“我们不是政治机关，为什么来测验我们的读报情况。”这就可见他们的单纯业务观点到了何等严重的程度。为了纠正上述现象，我们已发出通报，要求各级党组织充分运用报纸，加强对工作人员的政治、思想教育，并且认真检查本单位的读报学习，订出切实有效的改进办法。中共郑州市委宣传部
