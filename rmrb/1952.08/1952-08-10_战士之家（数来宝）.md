A: The hero's position is as solid as iron, eliminating countless devils.
B: The hero's position is unparalleled! First in ancient and modern times!
      Without steel bones and cement, nor any mountain-opening machinery,
    Relying on the heroes' great resolve, the hardest stone turns to mush.
A: The Volunteer Army, truly capable, every one a man of iron!
    Taking up guns to kill the enemy! Taking up pickaxes and shovels to open mountains.
B: Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulty, working together day and night!
    Never mind aching backs and sore hands, cotton-padded coats soaked through several times a day,
    Even if we sweat a little, we'll make the devils pay with blood!
A: The Volunteer Army, truly excellent! Skillful hands and ingenious minds!
    No matter how thick the stone, we'll hollow it out into a mansion!

    Up and down the stairs, it's effortless to go up and down.
A: The tunnel is like a long corridor, with many single rooms on both sides,
    There are bedrooms and dining halls, just like a Beijing hotel.
B: This corridor, long and long! Beautiful and well-connected in all directions!
    Able to defend, able to attack, both strong and concealed.
A: The fortifications are built perfectly! We've made our home on the high mountains.
    Sheltering from wind and snow, enemy shells can't collapse them.
B: Such fortifications are rare, infuriating American planes, B-29.
A: Such fortifications are rarely seen, infuriating the American atomic bomb!
B: Clapping bamboo clappers! Upon entering, this single room is truly inseparable,
    The cave entrance is small but the inside is large, with a grass-woven curtain hanging on the door,
A: The charcoal brazier is warm, a bean oil lamp lights the wall,
    The straw mat is half a foot thick! A large tarpaulin is laid on top.
B: The stone walls are built wonderfully! The wall is hung with a portrait of the leader!
A: Chairman Mao smiles at us! As if he has something to say to us.
B: Chairman Mao smiles at us! As if he's saying we're fighting well.
A: Chairman Mao, rest assured! The devils are afraid of our beating!
    If they dare to invade, we'll send them back home!
B: Comrades are talking and laughing, I raise my head to look at the wall newspaper.
    Wall newspapers, one after another, with criticism and praise!
    Old Zhang is truly active in combat, demanding to attack every day.
    Little Wang prepares well! After wiping his rifle, he wipes the ammunition!
A: A towel hangs on the left side of the wall newspaper, a snow-white, truly clean towel,
    The wall is covered with toothbrush bags, white cloth embroidered with red thread,
    The red thread embroidered with the words, resolutely "Eliminate the American devils!"
    The red thread is embroidered in bright red, winning merit for defending every inch of land!

    Pine branch archways, one after another, each with a slogan pasted on it:
    Be brave and tenacious in defending the position, defend peace and perform meritorious service!
B: The communication trench, marked with signs, each one like a street.
    Victory Street, Hero Street! The artillery lives on Power Street!
    Courage Street, Kill-the-Enemy Street! Leading straight to the front Pioneer Street!
A: This street is truly abundant! Just without an electric tram.
B: Comrade, you're truly good at "fixing"! There are no traffic police here.

    Hero Cave, Brave Man Cave, Model Hero Lone Brave Cave,
    Reinforced Concrete Cave, Iron Bone Cave, Lion Tiger Group Heroes Cave,
    The command post is in the Core Cave, the forward troops are in the Bayonet Cave,

    "Ding ding dang dang" a burst of noise, sparks flying everywhere, what's happening?
B: Comrade, you're truly confused, this is the ironworks furnace in the position.
    These comrades have a solution, forging iron in the anti-aircraft cave,
    Only because they dig caves every day, shovels and picks are worn down to the size of fists.
A: Comrades! Truly not bad, overcoming difficulties with solutions.
    American-made shell casings are used as anvils, shell boxes are used as bellows,
    The charcoal is not brought in for heating! But to burn red-hot and beat the pickaxe head.
B: Although our factory is small, increasing production and practicing economy has a great effect.
A: The pickaxe head is forged sharp and pointed, to repair trenches, dig caves, and open mountains;
B: The pickaxe head is forged as hard as steel, building fortifications is truly quick and effective.

    The Volunteer Army has a trick, overcoming difficulties to create.
A: Coming well, coming skillfully, let's both go in and take a bath.
B: Entering the cave! Wow! Truly good! This little cave is quite warm,
    Two large oil drums are sitting steadily on top,
    The hot water in the drums is steaming, plus a fire brazier it's even warmer.
A: Entering the cave, take off your clothes! "Plunk" sitting in the water.

    Zhao Yiman, Liu Hulan, steel warrior Zhang Zhijian,
A: Dadu River, Jinggang Mountain, the Eighth Route Army fought a great battle at Pingxingguan,
    Langya Mountain, Flying Tiger Mountain, the Volunteer Army fought its first battle at Yunshan,
    Plus a biography of heroes resisting America and aiding Korea.

    Resolutely perform meritorious service to annihilate the American imperialists! We must emulate the heroes!
A: Clapping bamboo clappers, walking happily, arriving at the cookhouse before our eyes.
    The cookhouse is truly hardworking! Grinding tofu day and night.
    Big tofu, small tofu, dried tofu, water tofu,
    Fried tofu, frozen tofu, stir-fried tofu, stewed tofu,
    Pan-fried tofu, braised tofu, tofu residue fried into balls,
    Tofu broth for washing clothes.
B: Just eating tofu isn't enough, to improve the living standards on the position,
    Dumplings, steamed buns, knife-cut noodles, changing it up every few days!
A: Guaranteeing victory at the front, tens of millions of people support us,
    All work for victory, all strength for the front line.
B: For the front line, for the front line, the logistics comrades work happily.
    The road is small and the mountain is steep, we still have to run across the blockade,
A: The sweat on our bodies cannot be wiped dry, grain and ammunition are sent to the front.
B: Sent to the front! Sent to the front! People don't lack food, cannons don't lack shells.
A: Hey! The comrades eat their fill, the hand grenades are prepared fully,
    The machine guns are wiped bright, the bullets are pressed full,
    The cannons are aimed accurately, our eyes are wide open,
    Finding an opportunity, we often launch small attacks.
    Wiping out entire platoons and squads! And grabbing a few live ones by the way.
    Scaring the devils into crying, unable to sleep at night.
B: If they dare to attack the position, let them get close,
    Steadily, accurately, suddenly open fire and hit them hard!
    Let them come alive and leave dead, see how many they send to die!
    Heroes are on the position, the position is there! Tenaciously and bravely defend the position!
All: Hey! Defend the position, defend the position! Defend peace, defend the motherland,
    Become a hero and go see Chairman Mao! Go see! Chairman Mao!
