Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. Our special correspondent reports: The negotiation tents at Panmunjom were empty today, because the US liaison officer did not attend the joint investigation into the US shelling of the conference area, and Harrison adjourned the negotiations until August 11th. Despite conclusive evidence, the US liaison officer denied responsibility for the shelling. This brings to mind the familiar incident last August when Ridgway flatly denied his bombing and strafing of the Kaesong neutral zone in an attempt to sabotage the negotiations. Now the last trick left for the US representatives to use for sabotage is adjournment. The US conspiracy is clearly to initially adjourn for three days, then for a week, and then indefinitely, trying to make it impossible to resolve the only remaining issue of prisoner repatriation.

Nearly thirteen months of armistice negotiations have reached a decisive juncture. Now that General Nan Ri has proposed finalizing the text of the draft armistice agreement, all sixty-three articles of the draft armistice agreement, including all agenda items, have been agreed upon. However, the armistice agreement cannot be signed, solely because the US representatives refuse to resolve the issue of prisoner repatriation in accordance with the agreement's provisions. If they re-examine the prisoner lists in accordance with Articles 51 and 52, a Korean armistice would be within easy reach.

People all over the world can now see clearly: The US representatives' refusal to continue negotiations and their adjournment is a violation of the principles that both sides have already agreed upon, and is a refusal to make a final effort for an armistice. The end of the plenary administrative meeting of the two delegations shows that when they agreed to Articles 51 and 52, they intended to violate these two articles.

Article 51 states: "All prisoners of war in the custody of both sides at the time this Armistice Agreement becomes effective shall be released and repatriated as soon as possible." Article 52 states: "Both sides guarantee that prisoners of war released and repatriated after this Armistice Agreement becomes effective shall no longer be used for acts of war in the Korean conflict." But Harrison wants to undermine this principle of letting all prisoners of war go home to live in peace. He insists that the US retain more than 13,000 Chinese prisoners of war and 20 percent of the Korean prisoners of war imprisoned by the US who have homes in North Korea. Harrison's plan is to hand them over to Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee in Taiwan in order to prepare cannon fodder for the US's aggressive plot to expand the war.

Thousands of Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war have been prevented from being repatriated because they were murdered by Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee agents and the US military. Many Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war have been forced to act as spies and airdropped into North Korea. Until now, Harrison has not dared to deny the fact that he lied in his letter to General Nan Ri when he said they "escaped." This is because many of these airdropped spies are now in the hands of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Events over the past two months have proven that Harrison was chosen by Joy and Clark to do the "unenviable job" of sabotaging negotiations using the methods of "nothing to say" and avoiding meetings. Unless Washington changes its policy of delaying negotiations, Harrison, who leads the US negotiating delegation, will have the "unenviable record" of ending the negotiations with a long-term adjournment and stifling peace in Korea.

Observers point out that the United States' current policy of sabotaging the conference with long-term or even indefinite adjournments will not work on the Korean and Chinese representatives at all. It will only show the world that the United States has no sincerity. In any case, the year-long negotiations will write in history and in the judgment of world public opinion the fact that the representatives of the US government fled the conference and evaded the meeting because they dared not face the condemnation of truth and justice put forward by the Korean and Chinese representatives at the meeting. Their shameful act of fleeing the meeting and sabotaging the negotiations can only declare further political failure of the United States to the people of Asia and the world.

### 新华社记者评美方逃会和破坏谈判的挑衅

    新华社记者评美方逃会和破坏谈判的挑衅
    【新华社开城七日电】本社特派记者报道：板门店的谈判帐篷今天都空了，因为美方联络官没有来参加双方对美方炮轰会场区事件的共同调查，同时哈利逊又把谈判休会到八月十一日。虽然证据确凿，美方联络官却否认对炮轰一事负有责任。这使人很熟悉地回忆起来去年八月李奇微矢口否认他轰炸扫射开城中立区以图破坏谈判的事。现在剩下来可以让美国代表进行破坏的最后一手就是休会。美方的阴谋显然是最初休会三天，接着休会一星期，然后就无限期地休会，想借此使得解决唯一剩余的遣俘问题成为不可能。
    将近十三个月的停战谈判已经到了一个决定的关头。现在，由于南日将军建议最后确定停战协定草案的文字，停战协定草案包括各项议程的六十三款已经全部获致协议。但是停战协定还是不能签字，这完全是因为美方代表拒绝按照协定的规定来解决战俘遣返问题。要是他们按照第五十一款和五十二款重新校正战俘名单，朝鲜停战就垂手可得。
    全世界人民现在可以看得清清楚楚：美方代表拒绝谈判下去、造成休会，就是违反双方已经同意了的原则，就是拒绝为停战尽最后一分力。双方代表团大会行政会议的结束说明：他们在同意第五十一款和五十二款的时候，就打算违反这两款了。
    第五十一款说：“本停战协定生效时，双方收容的全体战俘应尽速予以释放和遣返”。第五十二款说：“双方保证本停战协定生效后释放和遣返的战俘不再用于朝鲜冲突的战争行动”。可是哈利逊想破坏这个让全体战俘回家过和平生活的原则。他坚持要由美方扣留一万三千多名中国战俘和百分之二十的为美方囚禁而家在北朝鲜的朝鲜战俘。哈利逊的计划是把他们交给在台湾的蒋介石和李承晚，以便为美国扩大战争的侵略阴谋准备炮灰。
    有上千的朝鲜人民军的和中国人民志愿军的战俘就是因为被国民党和李承晚特务和美军谋杀而不能被遣返的。有许多中国人民志愿军战俘被迫充当特务而被空降到北朝鲜来。直到现在哈利逊不敢抵赖我方指责他在给南日将军的信中说他们“逃亡”是撒谎这一事实。这是因为这些空降特务有许多现在是在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军手中。
    过去两个月来的事件证明哈利逊是被乔埃和克拉克挑选出来做用“没有话可说”和逃会方法来破坏谈判的“不可羡慕的工作”的。除非华盛顿改变它的拖延谈判的政策，否则领导美国谈判代表团的哈利逊将有以长期休会断送谈判和扼杀朝鲜和平的
    “不可羡慕的纪录”。
    观察家指出：美国目前用长期的或甚至无限期休会方法来破坏会议的政策，对朝鲜和中国代表来说是一点也不会起作用的。它只会在世界面前表明美国毫无诚意。无论如何，一年来的谈判将在历史上和世界人民舆论的判决书里写上这个事实，即：美国政府的代表由于不敢在会议上面对朝中代表所提出来的真理和正义的谴责，因而逃出了会场，逃避了会议。他们可耻的逃会和破坏谈判的挑衅行为只能向亚洲和世界人民宣告美国进一步的政治上的失败。
