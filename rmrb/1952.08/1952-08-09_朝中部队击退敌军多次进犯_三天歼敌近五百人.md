Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, August 8th: In the first three days of August, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army repelled multiple invasions by the American and British aggressor troops, inflicting nearly 500 casualties on the enemy.

    On the 3rd, our forces repelled multiple invasions by the American aggressor troops at an unnamed height west of Tieyuan and east of Shangpu-ri, killing or wounding over 100 enemy soldiers. After completing the task of annihilating the enemy's active forces, our troops took the initiative to withdraw from the area. It was not until the next day that the enemy troops nervously climbed onto this place, which had caused heavy casualties to the U.S. 45th Division and the U.S. 1st Division. On the same day, an American battalion invaded an unnamed height northwest of Lianchuan and was met with a heroic counterattack by our infantry and a barrage of deep artillery fire, resulting in over 140 enemy casualties.

    On the 1st, a capable night raid team from our forces suddenly attacked the enemy troops entrenched on the south mountain of Xin Cun, Gao Zhan Xia Li, west of Lianchuan, annihilating over 100 British accomplice troops stationed there. On the same day, a company of the Li Chengwan puppet army invaded a certain mountain position of our army northeast of Jinhua, launching four consecutive assaults, all of which were repelled by our defending troops, resulting in 65 enemy casualties. From the 2nd to the 3rd, ambush units of our army annihilated over 40 Li puppet soldiers who had invaded Hongyuan-ri and Tuqi-dian, etc., west of Tieyuan and northwest of Tieyuan.

    朝中部队击退敌军多次进犯
    三天歼敌近五百人
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】八月份的头三天，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军打退美英侵略军的多次进犯，并杀伤敌军近五百人。
    三日，我军在铁原以西上浦防以东无名高地，打退了美国侵略军的多次进犯，杀伤敌人一百多名。我军在完成消灭敌人有生力量的任务后就主动撤离该地，直到第二天，敌军才提心吊胆地爬上这个曾使美军四十五师和美一师遭到惨重伤亡的地方。同日，美军一个营向涟川西北一个无名高地进犯，遭到我军步兵的英勇迎击和纵深炮火的轰击，敌军伤亡一百四十多人。
    一日，我军一支精干的夜袭队突袭涟川以西高栈下里新村南山的敌军，歼灭盘踞该地的英国帮凶军一百多名。同日，李承晚伪军一个连向金化东北我军某山头阵地进犯，连续冲锋四次，都被我守军击退，敌军伤亡六十五名。二日到三日，我军伏击部队在铁原以西和铁原西北的洪元里、土器店等处，歼灭向我窜犯的李伪军四十多名。
