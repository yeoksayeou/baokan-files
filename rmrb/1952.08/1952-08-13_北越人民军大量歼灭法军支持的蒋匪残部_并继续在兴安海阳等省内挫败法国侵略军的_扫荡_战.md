Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 7th: The General Command of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communique on July 28th, announcing that from mid-May to early July, the Vietnam People's Army annihilated bandits supported by the French colonialists and remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army who roamed the provinces of Lao Cai and Ha Giang, during the bandit suppression battles in these two provinces. In these battles, the People's Army killed, wounded, and captured 856 bandits, eliminated a large number of officers and special agents of the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, and seized four mortars, thirty-one machine guns, three hundred and thirty rifles, twenty-five pistols, 60,000 rounds of ammunition, four radio stations, and a large amount of other military supplies.

When the French army still occupied the northern Vietnamese border, they colluded with the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army and other bandits, frequently harassing the ethnic minority areas of the two provinces, harming the Nung and Miao residents. After the People's Army swept away the French colonial army from the border areas at the end of 1950, they also eliminated a large part of the bandits and remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's army deployed by the French army in 1951.

In early 1952, the French colonialists airdropped a large number of military supplies and food in the areas of Bo Lung, Lung Ping, and Xi Ma Cai to support those bandits. At the same time, many French officers and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents parachuted into the area. The French army also sent aircraft to assist the bandits in combat.

The People's Army began to suppress these bandits again in mid-May, driving them out of the areas of Dong Van and Hoang Su Phi in early July, and recovering Bo Lung and Xi Ma Cai. They have now eliminated most of them and are continuing to annihilate the remaining bandits.

The people of Lao Cai and Ha Giang provinces hate the French colonialists and their running dogs and enthusiastically support the People's Army in suppressing bandits. They actively transported grain, guided the army, and provided intelligence for the People's Army troops, warmly welcomed the People's Army, and encouraged and supported the army by helping the families of those engaged in battlefield service.

Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 8th: The Vietnam People's Army continues to wage anti-"mopping-up" campaigns in North Vietnam, eliminating the enemy's active strength.

On July 17th, the People's Army troops ambushed a French battalion attempting to mop up the northern and central parts of the Phu Lu area in Hung Yen province, killing and wounding 110 French officers and soldiers, including one captain and two lieutenants, capturing another 30, and seizing a large number of military supplies.

Local People's Army units, militia, and guerrillas in Hai Duong Province resisted the French aggressor army's "mopping-up" operations multiple times at the end of June, killing and wounding 50 French troops.

On July 4th, local People's Army units in Ha Nam Province ambushed the French army near Phu Ly, the capital of Ha Nam Province, killing 30 French troops, including one lieutenant, and wounding several French troops. The People's Army also seized mortars, submachine guns, and a large number of rifles and ammunition.

    北越人民军大量歼灭法军支持的蒋匪残部
    并继续在兴安海阳等省内挫败法国侵略军的“扫荡”战
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越七日讯：越南人民军总司令部七月二十八日发表公报宣布：越南人民军从五月中旬到七月初在老开省和河江省的剿匪战斗中，歼灭了法国殖民者所支持的土匪和流窜该两省境内的蒋介石匪军残部。人民军在这些战斗中毙、伤、俘土匪八百五十六名，消灭了大批残余蒋匪军的军官和特务，缴获了迫击炮四门、机关枪三十一挺、步枪三百三十支、手枪二十五支、子弹六万发、电台四部和大量其他军事供应品。
    当法军还占领北越边境时，他们便和蒋介石匪军残部和其他土匪勾结，经常侵扰该两省的少数民族地区，为害能族和苗族居民。一九五零年年底人民军扫荡边境地区的法国殖民军后，于一九五一年也把法军布置下的土匪和蒋匪军残部消灭了一大部分。
    一九五二年初法国殖民者在玻龙、隆平和西马街地区空投了大量军火和粮食接济那些匪徒，同时有许多法国军官和蒋介石的特务空降该区。法军并曾派飞机援助匪徒们作战。
    人民军在五月中旬再度开始剿灭这些匪徒，在七月初把匪徒逐出了同文和黄树皮地区，收复了玻龙和西马街，现已消灭其大部分，正继续歼灭残匪中。
    老开和河江两省人民痛恨法国殖民者及其走狗，热烈地支援人民军剿匪。他们积极地替人民军部队运送粮食、给军队带路和提供情报，热情地招待人民军，并以帮助从事战地勤务者的家属的行动来鼓励支援军队的人们。
    【新华社十一日讯】越南通讯社北越八日消息：越南人民军部队继续在北越进行反“扫荡”战，消灭法国殖民军的有生力量。
    人民军部队于七月十七日在兴安省内截击企图扫荡扶卢区北部和中部的法军一个营，打死打伤法军官兵一百一十名，其中包括一个上尉、两个中尉，俘掳了另外三十名，缴获了大量军事物资。
    海阳省地方人民军部队、民兵和游击队在六月底抵抗了法国侵略军多次的“扫荡”战，打死打伤法军五十名。
    河南省地方人民军部队于七月四日在河南省省会府里附近，截击法军，打死法军三十名，其中包括一个中尉，并打伤了法军若干名。人民军还缴获了迫击炮、冲锋枪和大量步枪与弹药。
