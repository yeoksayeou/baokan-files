Xinhua News Agency, August 21st:

Beijing universities and colleges held a graduation ceremony on the 21st, after a short period of study during the summer vacation for this year's graduating students. Attending the ceremony were Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council Guo Moruo, Minister of Education Ma Xulun, and Vice Minister Zeng Zhaolun, among others.

Minister Ma Xulun delivered a speech first. He said: The nation's financial situation has fundamentally improved, and large-scale economic construction is about to begin. He congratulated the students on completing their studies and joining the work of national construction, and asked everyone to obey the needs of the motherland, obey the unified allocation of the government, and happily take up their posts. He put forward three expectations for the graduates: (1) To firmly establish the determination to serve the people wholeheartedly; (2) To learn modestly, delve into their professions, and study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Do not be complacent in your work, and learn modestly from the workers and peasants; (3) Pay attention to physical exercise.

Then Vice Chairman Zhu delivered a speech, saying: New China is about to begin a large-scale construction undertaking, and he hopes that the students will give full play to their initiative and creativity after taking up their glorious work posts. The phenomenon of young students graduating and becoming unemployed in the old society no longer exists forever in New China. The task of the students in the future is to join the people of the whole country in participating in the upsurge of construction undertakings unprecedented in Chinese history. He called on everyone to obey the allocation of the state, go wherever they are needed, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Vice Chairman Li Jishen and Vice Premier Guo Moruo also spoke, and they unanimously congratulated the happiness of the youth who grew up in the era of Mao Zedong. They pointed out that the country has arranged ideal futures for the youth, and hope that everyone will obey the needs of the motherland, happily take up their posts, and constantly learn Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and advanced Soviet experience in their work, arm themselves with proletarian ideology, and strive to train themselves to become outstanding cadres of the country.

At the end of the ceremony, Le Daiyun, a graduate of Peking University, read a letter to Chairman Mao and the Volunteers on behalf of the graduates of twenty-three universities and colleges in North China.
