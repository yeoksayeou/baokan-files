Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 6th. The Chinese sports delegation participating in the 15th International Olympic Games submitted a letter of protest on the 3rd to Mr. Mayer, Secretary-General of the International Olympic Committee, and to the International Olympic Committee. The protest was against the resolution of the 47th International Olympic Committee meeting on July 17, which reserved the final decision on the status of the All-China Sports Federation and simultaneously invited the sports organizations of the Chinese Kuomintang remnant group in Taiwan to participate in the 15th International Olympic Games. The full text of the protest letter is as follows:

To Mr. Mayer, Secretary-General of the International Olympic Committee, and to the International Olympic Committee:

I telegraphed you on July 14, 1952, to express my firm opposition to your re-discussing the so-called request to recognize the All-China Sports Federation as the Chinese Olympic Committee, and I solemnly declared: "The All-China Sports Federation (Chinese Olympic Committee) was reorganized from the All-China Athletic Federation, which was previously recognized by the International Olympic Committee. It is the only legal national amateur sports organization in the People's Republic of China, exercising jurisdiction over sports throughout the country. Based on these facts, the All-China Sports Federation undoubtedly should be recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the Chinese Olympic Committee." However, the 47th International Olympic Committee meeting on July 17 decided to reserve the final decision on the status of the All-China Sports Federation. Although the resolution invited the All-China Sports Federation to participate in the 15th Olympic Games, it also invited the sports organizations of the Chinese Kuomintang remnant group in Taiwan to participate. I must protest against this decision, which violates the charter and spirit of the International Olympic Games, on behalf of the All-China Sports Federation. In order to maintain the solemn purpose and principles of the International Olympic Committee, I firmly demand that the International Olympic Committee immediately expel the sports organizations and representatives of the Chinese Kuomintang remnant group in Taiwan, which have long been spurned by the Chinese people and all fair-minded people around the world, from the International Olympic Committee, the International Olympic Games, and all relevant international sports federations. And continue to recognize the All-China Sports Federation as the Chinese Olympic Committee with its due status in various international Olympic organizations.

All-China Sports Federation (Chinese Olympic Committee)
Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Rong Gaotang
August 3, 1952

Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 6th.

    国际奥林匹克委员会对我国体育总会地位不作决定
    我国体育代表团向该委员会提出抗议
    【新华社赫尔辛基六日电】参加第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的中国体育代表团，在三日以抗议书一件递交国际奥林匹克委员会秘书长梅耶并国际奥林匹克委员会，对第四十七届国际奥林匹克委员会七月十七日会议决议把中华全国体育总会的地位的最后决定加以保留和同时邀请台湾中国国民党残余集团的体育组织参加第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会事，提出抗议。抗议书全文如下：国际奥林匹克委员会秘书长梅耶先生并转国际奥林匹克委员会：
    我已于一九五二年七月十四日致电贵会对贵会将所谓要求承认中华全国体育总会为中国奥林匹克委员会列入议程重新讨论表示坚决反对，并曾郑重声明：“中华全国体育总会（中国奥林匹克委员会）系由国际奥林匹克委员会所承认之前中华全国体育协进会改组而成，是中华人民共和国唯一合法的全国性业余体育运动组织，对全国范围内体育运动行使管辖权。根据这些事实，中华全国体育总会无疑地完全应该被国际奥林匹克委员会承认继续为中国奥林匹克委员会。”但第四十七届国际奥林匹克委员会七月十七日会议竟决议对中华全国体育总会的地位的最后决定加以保留，决议中虽邀请中华全国体育总会参加第十五届奥林匹克运动会，但同时又邀请了台湾中国国民党残余集团的体育组织来参加。对此项违反国际奥林匹克运动会章程与精神的决定，我不能不代表中华全国体育总会表示抗议。为了保持国际奥林匹克委员会的庄严宗旨和原则，我坚决要求国际奥林匹克委员会立即将早已为中国人民及全世界公正人士所唾弃的台湾中国国民党残余集团的体育组织和代表人员，从国际奥林匹克委员会、国际奥林匹克运动会及各有关国际运动联合会中驱逐出去。并继续承认中华全国体育总会作为中国奥林匹克委员会在国际奥林匹克各项组织中应有的地位。
    中华全国体育总会（中国奥林匹克委员会）
    副主席兼秘书长荣高棠
    一九五二年八月三日
    【新华社赫尔辛基六日电】芬兰共产党机关报“劳动人民报”和芬兰民主青年联合会机关报“自由谈”，在四日全文刊载了我国体育代表团为第四十七届国际奥林匹克委员会会议把中华全国体育总会的地位的最后决定加以保留和邀请台湾国民党残余集团参加第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会事，向国际奥林匹克委员会提出的抗议书。其他各报也刊载了抗议书的摘要。
