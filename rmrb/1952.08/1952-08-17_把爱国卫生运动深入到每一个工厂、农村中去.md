    Deepen the Patriotic Health Campaign into Every Factory and Village

    The patriotic health campaign launched by the people of the whole country in the surge of anger against the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism has achieved great results in the past few months. The sanitation work in many cities and villages has taken on a new look, and "miracles" of no flies and no rats have appeared. According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of July, more than 4,130,000,000 flies, mosquitoes and other pests and more than 920,000 catties of them had been killed across the country, more than 37,770,000 rats had been killed, and more than 14,000,000 tons of garbage had been removed. Some places have even removed garbage left over from the old society for decades or even hundreds of years. Many stinking pools and sewage ditches that have long plagued the health of the people have been filled or dredged. In the movement, the broad masses of the people have gradually developed the habit and atmosphere of paying attention to public health and personal hygiene. Health work organizations and health work systems in various places are also being gradually strengthened and enriched. Thanks to the development of this movement, we have not only effectively crushed the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism, but also laid the foundation and accumulated experience for improving our country's health work. This summer, the incidence of diseases in various parts of the country has generally decreased significantly compared with previous years. This has increased the health and happiness of the people of the whole country, and directly helped the construction of national defense, economy, and culture.

    However, these achievements are only a good start to our country's mass health campaign. To completely change the backwardness of health work caused by the long-term rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the people of the whole country still need to make long-term and persistent efforts. At present, the development of the patriotic health campaign is still uneven. According to the recent inspection results in various places, in cities, the sanitation work of some factories, schools, and agencies is still not as good as that of the general local citizens. Especially in some important industrial and mining areas, the sanitation situation is still very poor. In the countryside, many places have not yet launched a health campaign, and some places have only done a good job in a few key villages. At present, it is the turn of summer and autumn, which is a season when diseases are more likely to occur and spread. Therefore, all parts of the country should not only pay attention to preventing the occurrence of epidemics, but also make persistent efforts to further improve the patriotic health campaign, and pay special attention to changing the backward phenomenon of sanitation work in some factories, schools, and agencies in cities, and promote the patriotic health campaign to the vast rural areas.

    It should be pointed out that the phenomenon that the sanitation work of some factories, schools, and agencies lags behind the citizens is extremely inappropriate. They have better conditions for carrying out sanitation work than the masses, and they have the responsibility to set an example for the masses. However, the personnel of some units, especially some leading cadres, only talk eloquently and gesticulate to ask others to do sanitation work, but turn a blind eye to the stinky socks stuffed under their beds and the garbage piled at the door, or do not make specific leadership and inspection of the sanitation work in their units. Even people like the director of the Logistics Department of the Anhui Provincial Public Security Corps dared to openly resist the health campaign. Although this phenomenon is individual, it is very bad and should be corrected immediately. The method of Beijing and other places where leading organs and local health organizations regularly send people to inspect and supervise various streets, factories, schools, and agencies, and promptly commend and criticize, is an effective method to promote the progress of units with backward sanitation work. All localities should organize such inspections.

    When carrying out the patriotic health campaign in rural areas, attention should be paid to the following points: First, rural areas are vast and residents are scattered, so it is necessary to strengthen leadership. Not only should leading cadres attach importance to this work, but also strengthen the grass-roots organizations of the health campaign. To do a good job in sanitation in the vast rural areas, it is not enough to rely on a call from the leading organs, but specific organizational work must be done. At present, the leadership of the health campaign in some places is not sound. For example, the organization leading the health work in Changwei Special Region of Shandong Province is in a state of no one in charge, and only one or two cadres manage the telephone and handle some general affairs of "reporting upwards and receiving downwards." In this way, it is difficult to solve important problems in the patriotic health campaign in a timely manner and carry out the movement in depth. Second, because the cultural level of farmers is generally low, and some people have a strong sense of superstition and conservatism, special attention should be paid to publicity and education. In the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, many places established a "contracted publicity system," and this method is also applicable in this movement. Third, pay attention to grasping the season and combining it with production. Rural environmental sanitation work and fertilizer accumulation work are directly related. We should adapt to local conditions, think of more ways to ensure that sanitation and fertilizer accumulation are not affected, and that sanitation work helps fertilizer accumulation. Stiffly applying certain methods in cities and hindering farmers from accumulating fertilizer is not conducive to production and will not be able to carry out the movement well. Between summer hoeing and autumn harvest, farmers in various places generally have a relatively free time, and farmers generally use this time to accumulate fertilizer and tidy up their residences. This is the best time, and we should seize this time to launch a concentrated sanitation effort to lay the foundation for regular sanitation work. Fourth, pay attention to mobilizing women and children. The experience of various places has proved that women often play a major role in sanitation work. Their daily work is most closely related to the health campaign, and most of them have more time to do sanitation work. In many places, because women and children were mobilized, the sanitation work of all residents was promoted.

    It is a very arduous task to deepen the patriotic health campaign into every factory, school, agency and the vast countryside, but experience has proved that it is entirely possible to do so. Here, we must pay attention to overcoming the conservative thinking of some leading cadres. They emphasize material difficulties, rely on the help of the higher authorities, and think that the masses are "backward," but do not actively try to find ways to do it. The facts in many places have proved that the enthusiasm and strength shown by the people in the patriotic health campaign often exceed the expectations of the leading organs, and the work achievements far exceed the original plan of the higher authorities. It is hoped that leaders will not lag behind the masses.

### 把爱国卫生运动深入到每一个工厂、农村中去

    把爱国卫生运动深入到每一个工厂、农村中去
    全国人民在反对美帝国主义细菌战的怒潮中展开的爱国卫生运动，几个月来已获得了巨大的成绩。许多城市和农村的卫生工作已经面貌一新，出现了无蝇、无鼠的“奇迹”。据不完全统计，到七月底止，全国各地杀灭了蝇、蚊等害虫四十一亿三千余万只又九十二万多斤，捕杀老鼠三千七百七十多万只，清除垃圾达一千四百万吨以上。有的地方把旧社会遗留下来的几十年前甚至几百年前的垃圾也清除掉了。长期危害人民健康的许多臭水坑、污水沟填平或疏通了。广大人民在运动中逐渐养成注意公共卫生和个人卫生的习惯和风气。各地的卫生工作组织和卫生工作制度也在逐步加强着、充实着。由于这一运动的开展，我们不但有效地粉碎了美帝国主义的细菌战，而且为改进我国的卫生工作打下了基础、积累了经验。今年夏天，全国各地的疾病发生率普遍较往年大大减低。这就给全国人民增加了健康和幸福，直接帮助了国防建设和经济、文化建设。
    但是，这些成绩还只是我国群众性卫生运动的一个良好的开始，要把由于过去长期的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义统治所造成的卫生工作落后现象彻底改变，还需要全国人民长期地、坚持地继续努力。现在，爱国卫生运动的发展还是不平衡的。据各地最近检查的结果，在城市中，一部分工厂、学校、机关的卫生工作还赶不上当地的一般市民。特别是某些重要的工矿区，卫生情况还很差。在农村里，有许多地方还没有展开卫生运动，有的地方则只搞好了几个重点村。目前正是夏秋之交，是疾病比较容易发生和流行的季节，因此全国各地应该一面加意防止流行病的发生，一面再接再厉，把爱国卫生运动进一步做好，特别是要注意改变城市中部分工厂、学校、机关的卫生工作落后的现象，并把爱国卫生运动推进到广大农村中去。
    应当指出，某些工厂、学校、机关的卫生工作落后于市民的现象是极不应该的。他们开展卫生工作的条件比群众好，而且有责任要做群众的表率。可是某些单位的人员，特别是某些领导干部，只是夸夸其谈、指手划脚地要别人搞卫生工作，而对自己的床底下塞着的臭袜子、门口堆着的垃圾熟视无睹，或者对自己单位里的卫生工作不作具体的领导和检查。甚至像安徽公安总队后勤处处长等人竟敢公然抗拒卫生运动。这种现象虽然是个别的，但是是很恶劣的，应该立刻纠正过来。北京等地由领导机关和地方卫生组织经常派人到各街道和工厂、学校、机关中检查督促、及时表扬批评的办法，是推动卫生工作落后的单位进步的有效方法。各地都应该组织这种检查。
    在农村中普遍开展爱国卫生运动时，应该注意下列几点：第一，农村地区辽阔、居民分散，因此首先要加强领导，不独领导干部要重视这一工作，而且要健全卫生运动的基层组织。要把广大农村的卫生工作搞好，光凭领导机关的一纸号召是不够的，必须做具体的组织工作。目前，有的地方卫生运动的领导尚不健全，例如山东昌潍专区领导卫生工作的机构陷于无人负责状态，只有一两个干部管理电话，办理一些“呈上接下”的一般事务。这样是很难及时解决爱国卫生运动中的重要问题，把运动深入开展的。第二，因为农民的文化水平一般比较低，有的人有较浓厚的迷信、保守思想，因此要十分注意宣传教育工作。在抗美援朝运动中，许多地方建立了“包干宣传制”，这种办法在这次运动中也是适用的。第三，要注意掌握季节、结合生产。农村的环境卫生工作和积肥工作有直接的关系，应该因地制宜，多想办法，使卫生、积肥两不误，并使卫生工作有助于积肥。生硬地套用城市的某些方法，妨碍农民积肥，是既不利于生产，又无法把运动搞好的。夏锄和秋收之间，各地农民一般都有一段比较空闲时间，农民一般都利用这个时候积肥和整理住宅。这是最好的时机，应当紧紧抓住这个时间突击一次卫生工作，为经常的卫生工作打下基础。第四，要注意发动妇女和儿童。各地的经验证明，妇女往往在卫生工作中起主要作用，她们的日常工作和卫生运动关系最密切，她们中的多数人比较有时间去做卫生工作。许多地方因为发动了妇女、儿童，就把全体居民的卫生工作带动起来了。
    把爱国卫生运动深入到每一个工厂、学校、机关和广大农村，是十分艰巨的工作，但经验证明是完全可以作到的。这里要注意克服某些领导干部的保守思想，他们强调物质困难，依赖上级帮助，认为群众“落后”，而不积极想办法去做。许多地方的事实证明：人民群众在爱国卫生运动中所表现的热情和力量，往往超过领导机关的预料，工作成绩远远超过上级原订的计划。希望领导者不要落在群众的后面。
