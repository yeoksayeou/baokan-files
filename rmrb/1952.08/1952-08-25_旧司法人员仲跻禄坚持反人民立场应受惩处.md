Zhong Qilu, a retained clerk and current acting judge of the Civil Division of the People's Court of Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, has persisted in an anti-people stance during his tenure. He has spread reactionary old legal concepts such as the indiscriminate "equality before the law," and has rendered verdicts haphazardly. Over the past three years, he has seriously harmed the interests of the people and the prestige of the people's judicial organs.

During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951, Zhong Qilu tried the case of Ding Zhiyi, a notorious local tyrant in Chang'an County. During the confrontation, the peasants enumerated Ding's crimes with justification and conclusive evidence. However, Zhong Qilu slandered the peasants as "nitpicking." Seeing the "judge" supporting him, Ding took the opportunity to counterattack and openly accused the peasants in the People's Court: "Don't turn the court into a struggle session!" Zhong Qilu actually turned the People's Court into a forum for condoning local tyrants and slandering peasants! The masses reflected afterward: "The struggle session is where we reason, the court is where Ding Zhiyi reasons." During the same period, Zhong Qilu only listened to Zhang Shunxian's slander against the peasants when dealing with the local tyrant and bandit Zhang Shunxian, and turned a deaf ear to the peasants' accusations that Zhang had murdered thirteen people. As a result, he sentenced Zhang to be released. After correction by the higher authorities, Zhang Shunxian was finally executed, but Zhong Qilu insisted: "I checked the law, there is no such thing as a local tyrant crime."

Zhong Qilu also demonstrated a strong old yamen style in handling cases. Tian Shiyun from Caobao District, Chang'an County, consistently abused his daughter-in-law Zhang Guidan. In 1950, Tian Shiyun's daughter, Yueqin, had a quarrel with Zhang Guidan, and Tian Shiyun struck Guidan's lower leg with an iron shovel. Guidan fell to the ground, unconscious. To cover up and escape responsibility, Tian Shiyun threw Guidan into the well in the backyard, and threw a large brick on top of her. When handling this case, Zhong Qilu did not listen to the opinions of the masses or pay attention to the fact that Tian Shiyun had consistently abused Zhang Guidan. He subjectively and arbitrarily concluded that Zhang Guidan's death was unrelated to Tian Shiyun. What was particularly absurd was that he believed that "there was no weapon presented as evidence," so he "could not conclude that it was a fatal injury caused by an iron shovel, but rather a careless fall into the well." Therefore, he released the murderer Tian Shiyun.

Zhong Qilu has consistently been dilatory, perfunctory, and irresponsible in his work, often accumulating many cases. When the higher authorities urged him to handle them, he would write more than a dozen judgments in one night like "scribbling ghosts," and then bragged that he had "talent." In reality, most of the cases he judged were unsatisfactory to the masses, and many people appealed. The higher authorities warned him about this situation and asked him to improve his work, but he said shamelessly: "If there are no appeals, what is the provincial court for?" Every time he interrogated a case, he did not allow the parties to speak fully. He often said to the parties: "I ask what, you say what, don't ramble on!" Once, when handling a case involving civil and criminal matters, he followed the corrupt practices of the old court and notified the parties: "I will resolve the civil matter for you, and you can file a separate lawsuit for the criminal part in court." Another time, another judge, Ai Ziming, encountered a relatively difficult case and "consulted" Zhong Qilu. Zhong Qilu said: "These kinds of cases can only be handled with black donkey hooves and Five Thunder Bowls." (Note: Black donkey hooves and Five Thunder Bowls were "magic weapons" used by rural "shamans" in the past to "subdue demons." Here, it means that to handle these kinds of cases, one can only slam the table, glare at the parties, and use "pressure" and "intimidation.") This is the style of the Kuomintang! In handling marriage cases, he showed himself to be a defender of the feudal order. He even said: "Rural women are not worthy of talking about free marriage."

Zhong Qilu is forty-five years old this year. From 1928, he muddled along in the reactionary military and political organs of the Kuomintang and participated in reactionary organizations such as the Kuomintang, the Sanmin Youth League, and the "Sacred Virtue Path." From May 1946, he served as a clerk in the pseudo-Chang'an District Court. Because he had served the reactionary rulers for more than twenty years, he was extremely reactionary in politics and ideology. After liberation, he was retained, and although the higher authorities repeatedly educated him and helped him transform himself, the facts prove that he had no intention of reforming himself and starting anew. On the contrary, he frequently spread reactionary remarks and engaged in illegal activities. When the American invaders scurried to the Yalu River, he spread rumors and said privately: "In case the Americans come to China, I will do whatever gets me fed. Whoever gives me money, I will work for them." He tried his best to prevent his son from participating in the patriotic action of attending a military cadre school. During the "Three-Anti" movement, when the county public security bureau found individual embezzlers, he took the opportunity to slander the people's public security organs.

The People's Government cannot allow such reactionary elements to continue riding on the heads of the people and performing the solemn task of judgment. In order to safeguard the interests of the state and the people and purify the people's judicial organs, the Chang'an County People's Court has dismissed Zhong Qilu from his post.

### 旧司法人员仲跻禄坚持反人民立场应受惩处

    旧司法人员仲跻禄坚持反人民立场应受惩处
    陕西省长安县人民法院留用书记官、现任民庭代理审判员仲跻禄，在留用任职期间，坚持反人民立场，散布敌我不分的所谓“法律面前人人平等”等反动的旧法观点，胡乱判案，三年来严重地危害了人民群众的利益和人民司法机关的威信。
    一九五一年镇压反革命运动期间，仲跻禄审讯长安县著名恶霸丁志毅案。在对质时，农民们缕述丁犯的罪行，理直气壮，证据确凿。但仲跻禄却诬蔑农民为“吹毛求疵”。丁犯见“审判员”为他撑腰，便趁势反攻，公然在人民法庭上指责农民：“你们不要把法庭当成斗争会！”仲跻禄竟把人民法院变成了纵容恶霸诽谤农民的讲坛！群众事后反映：“斗争会是咱们讲理的地方，法院是人家丁志毅说理的地方。”同一期间，仲跻禄在处理恶霸土匪张顺贤时，也是只听信张犯对农民的诬蔑，对农民控告张犯杀害十三条命案的事实充耳不闻，因此判决将张犯释放。后经上级纠正，张顺贤终于被处决了，但仲跻禄却一再坚持说：“我查法律，就没有什么恶霸罪。”
    仲跻禄在处理案件中，还表现了浓厚的旧衙门作风。长安县曹堡区田世云，平时一贯虐待儿媳张桂丹。一九五○年，田世云的女儿悦琴和张桂丹发生口角，田世云就用铁锨猛击桂丹的下腿，桂丹被打倒在地，昏迷不醒。田世云为掩形灭迹，逃避罪责，又把桂丹投入后院井中，并投入大砖一块，落井下石。仲跻禄在经办此案时，不听取群众的意见，不重视田世云一贯虐待张桂丹的事实，就主观武断地说张桂丹之死与田世云无关。尤其荒谬的，是他认为“没有呈案凶器”，便“不能认为是铁锨镖伤致死，而是汲水失慎，落井毕命”，因此竟将杀人凶犯田世云释放。
    仲跻禄一贯工作拖沓，敷衍塞责，经常积压很多案件。上级催促他办理时，他就在一个晚上“鬼画符”似的写上十几份判决书，事后还夸耀说这是自己有“才气”。实际上，经他判决的案子，群众大多不满，纷纷上诉。上级曾以这种情况警告他，要他改进工作，他却毫不知耻地说：“不上诉，要省法院干甚么？”他每次审讯案件，都不容许当事人充分说话。他时常对当事人说：“我问甚么，你说甚么，不要胡拉乱扯！”有一次受理一件民事附带刑事的案件时，他沿用旧法院的腐朽作法，通知当事人说：“我给你解决民事，刑事部分你到法院另行起诉。”又一次，另一审判员艾子明遇见一件比较繁难的案子，“请教”仲跻禄。仲跻禄说：“这类案子，只有用黑驴蹄子、五雷碗。”（按：黑驴蹄子、五雷碗都是过去农村的“巫神”用以“降魔”的“法宝”。这里的意思是说，处理这类案件，只有对当事人拍桌瞪眼，用“压”和“吓”的办法。）这是十足的国民党作风！在处理婚姻案件中，更表现出他是封建秩序的维护者。他甚至说：“乡村妇女不配谈自由婚姻。”
    仲跻禄今年四十五岁，从一九二八年起，就在国民党反动军政机关混事，参加过国民党、三青团、“圣贤道”等反动组织。一九四六年五月起任伪长安地方法院书记官。由于他二十余年来一直为反动统治者服务，因此在政治上、思想上极其反动。解放后被留用，虽经上级一再教育，帮助他进行改造，但事实证明，他并没有革面洗心、重新作人的打算，反而经常散布反动言论，进行违法活动。当美国侵略者窜至鸭绿江边时，他就大肆造谣并私下说：“万一美国来中国，我是混饭干事，谁给我钱，我就给谁干。”他曾竭力阻挠自己的儿子参加军事干部学校的爱国行动。在“三反”运动中，县公安局查出有个别贪污分子，他便借机诬蔑人民的公安机关。
    人民政府对于这种反动分子，是不能容许其继续骑在人民头上，执行庄严的审判任务的。为了维护国家人民的利益，纯洁人民的司法机关，长安县人民法院已将仲跻禄撤职。
