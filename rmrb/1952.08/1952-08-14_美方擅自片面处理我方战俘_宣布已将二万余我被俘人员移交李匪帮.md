Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 13th: Disregarding our serious warnings, the U.S. side announced on the 10th that it had unilaterally completed the disposal of all 27,000 of our captured personnel. According to an Associated Press report, the last batch of 1,320 of our captured personnel out of the 27,000 were forcibly handed over to the Li Seung-man gang in Seoul on the 10th to be used as cannon fodder. Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army invading Korea, and the Li Seung-man also were present to supervise.

The U.S. side's illegal act of unilaterally disposing of prisoners of war began at the end of June. On June 22nd, Clark Headquarters illegally designated the aforementioned 27,000 of our captured personnel as "Korean civilians" and announced that they would be "released." Clark Headquarters put on a serious face, saying that "these civilians will return to their residential areas in various provinces of the Republic of Korea." However, the same statement exposed that Clark's so-called "release" and so-called "return to residential areas" were all lies. The statement admitted that the U.S. side would hand over the 27,000 of our captured personnel "to the responsible Republic of Korea government agencies," that is, to the Li Seung-man gang, the sworn enemy of the Korean people. According to a United Press report from Busan on June 27th, "an official of the South Korean government" had definitively "predicted" that "many" of the "27,000 detained civilians released from the UN prisoner-of-war camps starting next week" would "voluntarily join the Korean army." This shows that the U.S. side's so-called "release" is actually to hand over a large number of our captured personnel to the Li Seung-man gang to be used as cannon fodder.

Regarding the U.S. side's heinous act of unilaterally disposing of our captured personnel in violation of the Geneva Convention, the spokesman of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's armistice negotiation delegation issued a solemn warning as early as July 3rd. Our delegation spokesman pointed out: "The prisoner-of-war issue is under discussion, and any unilateral action to dispose of prisoners of war will undermine the entire basis for discussing the prisoner-of-war issue and is therefore absolutely unacceptable." However, the U.S. side ignored this and continued to unilaterally dispose of the prisoners. Putting the U.S. side's actions together with its recent series of actions, including long-term absenteeism, repeated violations of the neutral zone, intensified bombing of peaceful Korean towns, and clamoring to intensify ground offensives, the U.S. side's sinister intention to have no sincerity in achieving a Korean armistice and deliberately sabotage it becomes even more obvious.

Sources here pointed out: The U.S. side's act of handing over our captured personnel to the Li Seung-man gang under the pretext of unilateral "release" to force them to serve as cannon fodder is a complete violation of the solemn provisions of the Geneva Convention and is therefore completely illegal. The U.S. side must bear full responsibility for the aforementioned 27,000 of our captured personnel unilaterally disposed of by the U.S. side.

### 美方擅自片面处理我方战俘  宣布已将二万余我被俘人员移交李匪帮

    美方擅自片面处理我方战俘
    宣布已将二万余我被俘人员移交李匪帮
    【新华社开城十三日电】美方不顾我方的严重警告，在十日宣布已将二万七千名我方被俘人员全部片面处理完毕。据美联社消息，二万七千名我方被俘人员中的最后一批一千三百二十名，已于十日在汉城被强迫移交给李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特和李匪承晚并到场监视。
    美方这一片面处理战俘的非法行为，是在六月底开始的。六月二十二日，克拉克总部非法地将上述二万七千名我方被俘人员列为“朝鲜平民”，并宣布要“予以释放”。克拉克总部装出一本正经的面孔，说什么“这些平民将返回他们在大韩民国各道的居住区”。然而，就是同一个声明，却暴露出克拉克的所谓“释放”、所谓“返回居住区”，都是谎话。声明中承认：美方将把二万七千名我方被俘人员，“交给负责的大韩民国政府机构”，就是说，交给朝鲜人民的死敌李承晚匪帮。而据合众社釜山六月二十七日电透露：“南朝鲜政府的一个官员”已经肯定地“预料”，“自下星期日起从联军俘虏营获释的二万七千名被拘平民中”，“有很多人”将“自愿参加朝鲜军队”。由此可见，美方的所谓“释放”，实际上就是将我方大批被俘人员移交给李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。
    对于美方这种违背日内瓦公约，片面处理我方被俘人员的罪恶行为，朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军停战谈判代表团发言人早在七月三日就提出严正警告。我方代表团发言人指出：“战俘问题正在讨论之中，任何片面处理战俘的行动，都将破坏战俘问题讨论的整个基础，因而是绝对不能容许的。”然而，美方竟置之不顾，继续进行片面处理。把美方的这一行动和美方最近一系列的行动，包括实行长期逃会、一再侵犯中立区、加紧轰炸朝鲜和平城镇、叫嚣要加紧进行地面进攻等活动联系起来看，美方对实现朝鲜停战毫无诚意而蓄谋加以破坏的罪恶意图就更加明显了。
    此间人士指出：美方以片面“释放”为名把我方被俘人员移交给李承晚匪帮迫使他们充当炮灰的行为，完全违反日内瓦公约的庄严规定的，因此完全是非法的。对于上述为美方所片面处理的二万七千名我方被俘人员，美方必须担负完全的责任。
