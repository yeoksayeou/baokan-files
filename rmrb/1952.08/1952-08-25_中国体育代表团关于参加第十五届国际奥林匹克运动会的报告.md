Report on the Participation of the Chinese Sports Delegation in the 15th International Olympic Games
    Rong Gaotang, Head of the Chinese Sports Delegation

    The participation of the Sports Delegation of the People’s Republic of China in the 15th International Olympic Games is a new victory for the Chinese people in international activities. The All-China Sports Federation (i.e., the Chinese Olympic Committee) sent a delegation of 40 people, including football and basketball teams and swimming athletes, to participate in the Games held in Helsinki. Our representatives also attended the congresses of various sports federations recognized by the International Olympic Committee. This not only safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people but also vigorously promoted friendly relations between our athletes and athletes from other countries, thereby making a beneficial contribution to the cause of world peace.

    The International Olympic Games are held every four years. According to the charter of the International Olympic Games, the Olympic Committees of various countries have the right to send representatives to participate in the International Olympic Games. The All-China Sports Federation was reorganized from the former All-China Athletic Federation, which was recognized by the International Olympic Committee after the founding of the People’s Republic of China. It is the only legitimate national amateur sports organization in the People’s Republic of China and the only legitimate Chinese Olympic Committee. It exercises jurisdiction over sports activities nationwide and continues to participate in relevant international sports federations. Therefore, it fully complies with the provisions of Articles 25 and 45 of the Olympic Charter and has full qualifications and rights to send representatives to participate in the International Olympic Games. As early as February 5th of this year, the All-China Sports Federation sent a telegram to the International Olympic Committee, notifying them of its continued participation in this Olympic Games. However, due to the fact that some people in the International Olympic Committee, under the influence of certain forces, deliberately ignored the above-mentioned facts, they violated the principle stipulated in Article 1 of the International Olympic Charter: that no discrimination should be made against a country or individual because of differences in skin color, religion, or political views, and adopted a discriminatory and unfriendly wrong attitude towards the Chinese people. They not only did not invite the sports organization of the People’s Republic of China to participate in this Olympic Games, but instead invited the sports organization of the remnant group of the Kuomintang of China in Taiwan to participate in this Olympic Games. Obviously, some people did not want to see athletes from New China appear on the sports fields of Helsinki, did not want our athletes to meet with athletes from other countries, and did not want to see our five-star national flag, representing 500 million people, fly in the sky above the 15th International Olympic Games. However, these attempts failed in the face of justice. Thanks to the Chinese people's resolute defense of their rights and the widespread support of world public opinion, the International Olympic Committee finally made a resolution on July 17th to invite athletes from the People’s Republic of China to participate in this Olympic Games. This victory of the Chinese people is a victory for peace and justice. It forcefully shattered the futile efforts of certain international forces to obstruct the participation of representatives of the Chinese people in international activities and to prevent Chinese athletes from having friendly contact with athletes from other countries. It is regrettable that the resolution to simultaneously invite the sports organization of the remnant group of the Kuomintang of China in Taiwan to participate in the Olympic Games was still passed at this meeting, and the membership of the All-China Sports Federation was reserved. The All-China Sports Federation cannot agree to this unreasonable resolution. In order to promote friendly cooperation between countries, although we have reservations about the resolution of the International Olympic Committee, we still sent our sports delegation of the People’s Republic of China to participate on July 25th. We arrived in Helsinki with the peaceful wishes and friendship of the quarter of the world's population, the entire Chinese people, and had friendly meetings with nearly seven thousand athletes from 69 countries.

    The activities of the Chinese Sports Delegation in Helsinki fully demonstrated the spirit of friendly cooperation of the Chinese people in international activities. Our delegation arrived in Helsinki on July 29th and was immediately warmly welcomed by the Finnish people and athletes from the Soviet Union and many other countries. During our time in Helsinki, we officially participated in the swimming competition of the International Olympic Games. The football and basketball teams were unable to officially participate in the competition due to the delayed arrival of our delegation, but they held four friendly matches in Helsinki and two other cities. On the day our delegation arrived in Helsinki, the organizing committee of the International Olympic Games raised our national flag in front of our delegation's residence, at the main stadium, and on various streets in Helsinki. Our national flag also appeared in the row of flags of 70 countries at the closing ceremony of the Games, jointly completing the closing ceremony. The remnant group of the Kuomintang of China in Taiwan, instigated by certain forces, sent the clown Hao Gengsheng to Helsinki in an attempt to steal the name of the Chinese sports organization and engage in shameless activities, and even spread rumors that Mr. Dong Shouyi, the Chinese member of the International Olympic Committee, had died in a concentration camp; but when our delegation arrived in Helsinki, Mr. Dong Shouyi, the general director of our delegation, appeared at the venue together with the delegation, and the clown Hao Gengsheng was never seen again in Helsinki. At the same time, the basketball team of the remnant group of the Kuomintang of China in Taiwan, which was staying in Manila in preparation for participating in the Olympic Games under a false name, had to sneak back to Taipei quietly. Thus, the shadow of this puppet show disappeared in the sunlight.

    Our delegation also hosted sports delegations from various countries in Helsinki. Those present included more than one hundred delegation leaders and athletes from sixteen countries, including the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, the United States, Britain, Finland, Austria, Australia, Canada, Ceylon, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, and Switzerland. The reception proceeded in a pleasant and friendly atmosphere for four hours, and the mood was extremely warm. Our delegation also visited the Peace Camp, which was held in Helsinki at the same time as the Olympic Games, and exchanged views on striving for peace with more than 300 young people from various countries, further strengthening the unity of peace-loving youth from various countries. We also participated in a meeting of outstanding athletes from various countries, attended by more than 15,000 Finnish people, hosted by the Finnish Peace Committee, and spoke at the meeting. We held a press conference, and also participated in the International Sports Education Conference, which is traditionally held after the Olympic Games, and met with representatives from 21 countries attending the conference, and introduced the development of sports in New China at the meeting. Through all these activities, we introduced the new face of sports in New China, expressed the Chinese people's love of peace and their willingness to establish friendly relations with the people and athletes of various countries.

    The representatives and athletes of New China received great attention everywhere during their participation in this International Olympic Games and received the warm friendship of athletes from various countries. This fully demonstrates that only the sports organization of the People’s Republic of China has the right to maintain the legitimate rights and interests of China's past participation in the International Olympic Committee; and only the athletes of the People’s Republic of China are qualified to represent China in the International Olympic Games.

    The Finnish people warmly welcomed the Chinese delegation. Many Finnish people came to welcome us when we arrived in and left Helsinki. During the several ball games, the Finnish people also showed us deep friendship. A Finnish friend was very excited when he received a Chairman Mao badge and said: "I have never met Mao Zedong, but I know him, and I will wear this badge forever." Many athletes from various countries were honored to receive a Chairman Mao badge.

    Soviet athletes achieved excellent results in this Olympic Games. They created two world records, three European records, and twelve Soviet records, and won 106 Olympic medals, including 38 gold medals, 53 silver medals, and 15 bronze medals, for a total score of 494 points (the same as the United States, the highest score). If the referees had been fair and impartial, they would have scored even more. Hungarian athletes also showed superior achievements. They scored a total of 264 points, ranking third. The Hungarian football team defeated the defending football champion, the Swedish football team, with a score of six to zero, and then defeated the Yugoslav team with a score of two to zero in the football final, winning the title of football champion team of this Olympic Games. The world-renowned Czechoslovak athlete Zatopek won three gold medals in long-distance running. Athletes from many other countries also performed well in this Olympic Games. We should congratulate the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries on the victories they achieved in this Olympic Games.

    Among the Eastern countries, athletes from India and Iran also achieved certain results.

    The Chinese Sports Delegation has successfully completed the mission entrusted to it by the Chinese people, officially participated in this International Olympic Games, and established good relations and friendship with athletes from various countries. We believe that after this observation and learning, it will definitely have an important role in promoting the development of sports in our country. Let us more widely popularize sports in our country, and on the basis of popularization, cultivate a large number of outstanding athletes, constantly create new records, and strive to improve the level of sports in our country.

    中国体育代表团关于参加第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的报告
    中国体育代表团团长　荣高棠
    中华人民共和国体育代表团参加第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会，是中国人民在国际活动中的一个新的胜利。中华全国体育总会（即中国奥林匹克委员会）此次派出了包括足、篮球队与游泳选手的四十人的代表团参加了在赫尔辛基举行的运动会。我国代表还出席了为国际奥林匹克委员会所承认的各项运动联合会的代表大会。这就不仅维护了中国人民的合法权益，而且有力地促进了我国与各国运动员的友好关系，从而对世界和平事业作了有益的贡献。
    国际奥林匹克运动会规定每四年举行一次。按照国际奥林匹克运动会的章程，各国的奥林匹克委员会有权派出代表参加国际奥林匹克运动会。中华全国体育总会是在中华人民共和国成立之后，由国际奥林匹克委员会所承认的前中华全国体育协进会改组而成，它是中华人民共和国唯一合法的全国性业余体育组织，也是唯一合法的中国奥林匹克委员会。它对全国范围的体育运动行使管辖权，并继续参加各有关国际运动联合会。因此，它完全符合奥林匹克运动规章第二十五条和第四十五条的规定，具有派出代表参加国际奥林匹克运动会的充分条件和权利。早在今年二月五日，中华全国体育总会就致电国际奥林匹克委员会，通知继续参加本届国际奥林匹克运动会。但是，由于国际奥林匹克委员会中一些人在某些势力的影响下故意无视上述种种事实，竟违反了国际奥林匹克运动规章第一条中所规定的：不允许因肤色、宗教及政治见解之不同而歧视某一国家或个人之原则，而对中国人民采取了歧视和不友好的错误态度。他们不但不邀请中华人民共和国的体育组织参加本届运动会，反而邀请台湾中国国民党残余集团的体育组织参加本届运动会。很显然地，有些人不愿意新中国的运动员出现在赫尔辛基的运动场上，不愿使我国运动员与各国运动员会见，也不愿看到代表五亿人口的我五星国旗飘扬在第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的上空。但是，这些企图在正义面前失败了。由于我国人民坚决保卫自己的权益和世界舆论的广泛支持，七月十七日举行的国际奥林匹克委员会始作出决议，邀请中华人民共和国的运动员参加本届运动会。中国人民的这一胜利，是和平和正义的胜利，它有力地击破了国际上某些势力企图阻挠中国人民的代表参加国际活动和拦阻中国运动员和各国运动员进行友好接触的徒劳的努力。遗憾的是：在这次会议上仍然通过了同时邀请台湾中国国民党残余集团的体育组织参加运动会的决议，并对中华全国体育总会的会员籍问题加以保留。对这种不合理的决议，中华全国体育总会是不能予以同意的。为了促进国际间的友好合作，我们虽对国际奥林匹克委员会的决议抱着遗憾的态度，仍在七月二十五日派遣了我中华人民共和国体育代表团前往参加。我们带着占世界人口四分之一的全中国人民的和平愿望与友情到达了赫尔辛基，和来自六十九个国家的将近七千位运动员作了友好的会晤。
    中国体育代表团在赫尔辛基的活动，充分表现了中国人民在国际活动上友好合作的精神。我代表团在七月二十九日到达赫尔辛基，当即受到芬兰人民和苏联及许多国家运动员的热情欢迎。在赫尔辛基期间，我们正式参加了国际奥林匹克运动会的游泳比赛；足球队和篮球队则由于我代表团受阻迟到，未能正式参加比赛，但曾在赫尔辛基及其他两城市进行了四场友谊比赛。在我代表团抵达赫尔辛基的当日，国际奥林匹克运动会的筹备委员会即在我代表团的住所前、大会运动场及赫尔辛基各街道升起了我国国旗，而在大会闭幕时我国国旗亦出现于七十个国家的国旗行列中共同完成了运动会的闭幕仪式。台湾中国国民党残余集团在某些势力嗾使下，派了小丑郝更生潜赴赫尔辛基，企图盗用中国体育组织名义进行无耻活动，并且还造谣说国际奥林匹克委员会中国委员董守义先生已死于集中营；但当我代表团到达赫尔辛基之后，我国代表团的总指导董守义先生和代表团一道出现在会场上，赫尔辛基就再也不见小丑郝更生的踪影。同时，台湾中国国民党残余集团准备冒名参加奥林匹克运动会而停留在马尼拉的篮球队也不得不悄然地溜回台北，于是这出傀儡戏的暗影就在太阳光下消逝了。
    我们代表团在赫尔辛基还招待了各国体育代表团，到会的有苏联、德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、美国、英国、芬兰、奥地利、澳大利亚、加拿大、锡兰、新西兰、南非、瑞典、瑞士等十六个国家的百余位代表团负责人及运动员。招待会在愉快友好气氛中进行了四小时，情绪至为热烈。我代表团又访问了在赫尔辛基和运动会同时举行的和平营，和三百多个各国青年交换了争取和平的意见，进一步加强了各国爱好和平的青年的团结。我们同时也参加了芬兰和平委员会所主持有一万五千多芬兰人民参加的各国优秀运动员的会见，并在会上讲了话。我们举行过记者招待会，又参加了照例于运动会后举行的国际体育教育会议，和参加会议的二十一国代表会见，并在会上介绍了新中国体育运动发展的情况。通过所有这些活动，我们介绍了新中国体育运动的新面貌，表达了我国人民的爱好和平和愿与各国人民及运动员建立友好关系的愿望。
    新中国的代表和运动员，在参加本届国际奥林匹克运动会的过程中，到处受到极大的注视，接受了各国运动员的亲切友谊。这就充分显示了：只有中华人民共和国的体育组织，有权利保持中国过去参加国际奥林匹克委员会的合法权益；同时也只有中华人民共和国的运动员，有资格代表中国参加国际奥林匹克运动会。
    芬兰人民对中国代表团是热诚欢迎的。我们到达及离开赫尔辛基时都有很多芬兰人民来欢迎和欢送。在几场球赛中，芬兰人民也对我们表现了深厚的友好态度。有一芬兰朋友，当他得到一枚毛主席纪念章时极为兴奋地说：“我没见过毛泽东，但我知道他，我将永远佩带这个纪念章。”很多国家的运动员都以得到一枚毛主席的纪念章为光荣。
    苏联的运动员在这次运动会中得到了极优异的成就。他们创造了两项世界纪录，三项欧洲纪录和十二项苏联纪录，得到奥林匹克奖章一百零六枚，其中金质奖章三十八枚，银质奖章五十三枚，铜质奖章十五枚，共得总分四百九十四分（与美国同为最高成绩）。如果裁判员都能公正无偏的话，他们得分会更多。匈牙利运动员也表现了优越的成就。他们得总分二百六十四分，为第三位。匈牙利的足球队以六比零的纪录击败了上届足球冠军队瑞典足球队，在足球决赛中又以二比零战胜南斯拉夫队而荣获本届运动会足球冠军队的称号。世界闻名的捷克斯洛伐克运动员萨托皮克在长跑中获得了三枚金质奖章。其他还有不少国家的运动员在这次运动会中都有良好的表现。我们应当对苏联及各人民民主国家在这次运动会中所取得的胜利表示祝贺。
    在东方的国家中，印度、伊朗的运动员也有一定的成就。
    中国体育代表团已经胜利地完成了中国人民的委托，正式地参加了本届国际奥林匹克运动会，和各国的运动员建立了良好的关系及友谊。我们相信经过这次观摩和学习，在促进我国体育运动的开展上必将产生重要的作用。让我们更加广泛地普及我国的体育运动，并在普及的基础上培养出大批优秀的运动员，不断创造新纪录，努力提高我国的体育水平。
