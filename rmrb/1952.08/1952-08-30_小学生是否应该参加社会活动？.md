    Should Elementary School Students Participate in Social Activities?
    Question: Should elementary school students participate in social activities? Will elementary school students' participation in social activities cause negative effects on their studies and health?
    Answer: The elementary school education of New China should not only improve children's cultural level and scientific knowledge, but also cultivate in children new morals of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and cherishing public property, and develop children's thinking of serving the people. Therefore, in addition to combining "Five Loves" education in teaching, encouraging children to participate in social activities within their capabilities under the principle of not hindering their studies and health is of great benefit. On the one hand, children use the knowledge they have gained in school to do beneficial work for society; on the other hand, through social activities, children are also educated in realistic struggles, exercise their social activity skills, and enrich their social knowledge and production knowledge. The "National Children's Spring Festival Comfort to Martyrs' and Soldiers' Families One Thing Movement," which was enthusiastically launched throughout the country, as well as the experience of other children participating in social activities, are good examples.
    However, it must be clear that the primary task of elementary school students is to study hard; participation in social activities is only one of the important ways to assist children in better learning. In some places, phenomena have occurred where elementary school students have participated in too many social activities that exceed their capabilities, which has affected their studies and health. This is a deviation, and elementary school teachers and local children's work departments should pay attention to preventing and correcting this deviation.

### 小学生是否应该参加社会活动？

    小学生是否应该参加社会活动？
    问：小学生是否应该参加社会活动？小学生参加社会活动是否会造成影响学习和健康的不良现象？
    答：新中国的小学教育，不但要提高儿童的文化水平和科学知识，并且要培养儿童爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的新道德，发展儿童为人民服务的思想。因此，除了在教学中结合“五爱”教育外，鼓励儿童在不妨碍学业和健康的原则下，参加他们能力所及的社会活动是有很大好处的。一方面，儿童们把学校里获得的知识，替社会做了有益的工作；另一方面，通过社会活动，儿童们也受到现实斗争的教育，锻炼了自己的社会活动能力并丰富了自己的社会知识和生产知识。曾在全国热烈展开的“全国少年儿童春节慰劳烈、军属一件事运动”，以及其他儿童参加社会活动的经验都是很好的例证。
    但是，必须明确，小学生的主要任务是好好学习；参加社会活动只是辅助儿童更好学习的重要方式之一。某些地方曾发生了小学生因参加过多的和超乎儿童能力所及的社会活动，以致影响学习和健康的现象，这是一种偏向，小学教员和当地少年儿童工作部门应该注意防止并纠正这种偏向。
