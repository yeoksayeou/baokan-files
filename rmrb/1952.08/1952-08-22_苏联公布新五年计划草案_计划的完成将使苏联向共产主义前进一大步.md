Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 21st: The draft of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy from 1951 to 1955, prepared by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), has been published. The completion of this plan will bring the Soviet Union a big step forward from socialism to communism.

The draft plan stipulates that the level of industrial production in 1955 should be increased by about 70 percent compared to 1950, and the total industrial output should increase by 12 percent annually. In terms of heavy industry, the production of pig iron will increase by 76 percent, steel production by 62 percent, coal production by 43 percent, oil production by 85 percent, and electricity production by 80 percent in five years. This means that in 1955, more than 34.05 million tons of pig iron, more than 44.17 million tons of steel, more than 372.68 million tons of coal, more than 69.96 million tons of oil, and more than 162.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity can be produced. As everyone knows, in his speech on February 9, 1946, Stalin proposed the goal of completing, in approximately three five-year plans, annual production of 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil. The draft of the Fifth Five-Year Plan tells us that by the end of 1955, this great goal will reach 68 percent, 73.6 percent, 74.5 percent, and 116.6 percent respectively in pig iron, steel, coal, and oil. This will make the peace fortress, the Soviet Union, even more incomparably powerful. In terms of light industry and the food industry, the draft plan stipulates that the production of consumer goods should be rapidly increased, and the production of these industries should be expanded by more than 70 percent in five years. During the Five-Year Plan period, the mechanization and automation of various production processes will also be carried out on a large scale. In order to carry out the above-mentioned tasks, the draft plan stipulates that the Soviet government will allocate funds for industrial construction work that are approximately twice the amount of industrial investment in the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

In agriculture, according to the draft plan, the total output of grain should increase by 40 to 50 percent in five years. This means that the total grain output in 1955 should reach 10.64 billion to 11.4 billion poods, which is 348.728 billion to 373.564 billion jin. One of the most important tasks in agriculture is to use electric tractors and other electric agricultural machines. In 1955, 90 to 95 percent of the plowing and sowing of grain, industrial crops, and feed crops should be mechanized, and 80 to 90 percent of grain harvesting should be mechanized. Animal husbandry will also be greatly developed. During the five-year period, the Soviet government will invest funds in agricultural construction that are approximately 2.1 times that of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, and the funds invested in irrigation and soil improvement are approximately four times that of the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

According to the draft plan, the Soviet state will also vigorously develop trade, transportation, and telecommunications. The retail sales of state-owned and cooperative businesses will increase by approximately 70 percent. The state will invest 63 percent more funds in the construction of transportation and telecommunications than in the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Railway freight volume will increase by 35 to 40 percent, inland waterway freight volume will increase by 75 to 80 percent, and automobile freight volume will increase by 80 to 85 percent.

Based on the continuous expansion of socialist production and the continuous improvement of social labor productivity, according to the draft plan, the national income of the Soviet Union will increase by more than 60 percent in five years, that is, it will reach more than 336.6592 billion rubles per year. Due to the increase in real wages and the great improvement in social welfare, the lives of workers and staff will be further improved. In the last year of the Five-Year Plan, the number of workers and staff in the national economy will increase by approximately 15 percent compared to 1950, that is, it will increase to approximately 45.08 million people. In 1955, institutions of higher education will train approximately twice as many specialized talents for the most important industrial construction departments as they did in 1950.

According to the draft plan, in order to complete the great tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet people must further develop the inherent potential of the national economy, carry out mass rationalization proposal campaigns, practice strict economy, strengthen the financial control of financial institutions, and strictly abide by national discipline. The Soviet national economy will have a new and powerful upsurge, and the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people will be further greatly improved.

    苏联公布新五年计划草案
    计划的完成将使苏联向共产主义前进一大步
    【新华社莫斯科二十一日电】苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会所草拟的一九五一年到一九五五年苏联发展国民经济的五年计划草案已经公布。这是苏联的第五个五年计划。这个计划的完成，将使苏联由社会主义向共产主义前进一大步。
    计划草案规定，一九五五年工业生产水平要比一九五○年提高约百分之七十，工业总生产量每年将增加百分之十二。在重工业方面，五年中铣铁产量增加百分之七十六，钢产量增加百分之六十二，煤产量增加百分之四十三，石油产量增加百分之八十五，电力产量增加百分之八十。这就是说，一九五五年可以生产铣铁三千四百零五万余吨，钢四千四百一十七万余吨，煤三亿七千二百六十八万余吨，石油六千九百九十六万余吨，电力产量一千六百二十五亿余瓩时。大家知道，斯大林在一九四六年二月九日发表的演说中提出要在大约三个五年计划期间完成的目标是：年产铣铁五千万吨、钢六千万吨、煤五亿吨、石油六千万吨。第五个五年计划草案告诉我们：到一九五五年底，这个伟大的目标在铣铁、钢、煤和石油方面就要分别达到百分之六十八、百分之七十三点六、百分之七十四点五和百分之一百一十六点六。这将使和平堡垒苏联更加无比强大。在轻工业和食品工业方面，计划草案规定迅速增加消费品的生产，要在五年中使这些工业的生产扩大百分之七十以上。五年计划期间还将大规模进行各种生产过程的机械化和自动化工作。为了执行上述各种工作，计划草案规定苏联政府指拨约为第四个五年计划工业投资两倍的资金进行工业建设工作。
    在农业方面，按照计划草案的规定，谷物总产量在五年中要增加百分之四十到五十。这就是说一九五五年谷物总产量要达到一百零六亿四千万至一百一十四亿普特，也就是三千四百八十七亿二千八百万市斤至三千七百三十五亿六千四百万市斤。农业方面最重要的任务之一便是使用电力拖拉机和其他电力农业机器。在一九五五年，要使耕地和谷物、工业作物及饲料作物的播种工作百分之九十到九十五机械化，使谷物收割工作百分之八十到九十机械化。畜牧业也将大大发展。五年期间，苏联政府将以约为第四个五年计划的二点一倍的资金投入农业建设方面，而投入灌溉和土壤改良方面的资金约为第四个五年计划的四倍。
    按照计划草案，苏维埃国家还将大力发展贸易、运输与电讯交通事业。国营与合作社营零售贸易额将增加约百分之七十。国家将以比第四个五年计划多百分之六十三的资金投入运输和电讯交通的建设事业。铁路货运将增加百分之三十五到四十，内河货运增加百分之七十五到八十，汽车货运增加百分之八十到八十五。
    在社会主义生产的不断扩大和社会劳动生产率不断提高的基础上，按照计划草案规定，苏联国民收入在五年中将增加百分之六十以上，也就是说要达到每年三千三百六十六亿五千九百二十万卢布以上。由于实际工资的增加和社会福利的大大增进，工人和职员的生活将进一步提高。在五年计划的最后一年，国民经济中工人和职员的数目将比一九五○年增加约百分之十五，也就是说增加到约四千五百零八万人。一九五五年高等教育机关将为最重要的工业建设部门培养出约相当于一九五○年培养出的两倍的专门人材。
    按照计划草案，为了完成第五个五年计划的伟大任务，苏联人民要进一步发挥国民经济的内在潜力、开展群众性的合理化建议运动、厉行节约、加强财政机关在财政上的控制、严格遵守国家的纪律。苏联国民经济将有新的强大的高涨，苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平将进一步大大提高。
