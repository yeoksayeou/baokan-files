Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in order to help the Korean people overcome the various difficulties caused by the American aggressors, launched a widespread campaign throughout the army in late March of this year to save grain to aid Korean disaster victims and help the Korean people carry out spring farming production. According to very incomplete statistics, by mid-May, the entire army had saved more than 2,450,000 jin of grain; the troops had helped the Korean people cultivate more than 131,000 mu of land (converted to Chinese mu); planted more than 12,000 mu; reclaimed 1,100 mu; fertilized more than 3,000 mu; and delivered 451,187 dan and 98,800 baskets of manure. Under the slogan "Help Korea build like we build our motherland," the entire army, with high labor enthusiasm, built water conservancy projects for the Korean people. According to incomplete statistics, the entire army built more than 100 canals, more than 100,000 meters long; built more than 40 dams, more than 8,000 meters long; and also built many sluices, reservoirs, and storage ponds. Around the Qingming Festival, the entire army also planted more than 5 million trees in various places.

The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army demonstrated the highest initiative and greatest enthusiasm in this great internationalist action. The soldiers said: "The difficulties of the Korean people are our difficulties," "Resisting America and aiding Korea is for the liberation of the Korean people, and now that they have difficulties, we have a responsibility to help solve them."

In the work of saving and providing disaster relief, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean local governments jointly organized visiting groups to investigate the disaster situation, determine the relief recipients, and assess the relief grades, so that the grain could be delivered to those who needed it most.

When spring plowing began in mid-April, heavy snow fell on the central and eastern fronts. The soldiers braved the wind and snow, regardless of the cold, and persisted in cultivating in the fields for eight hours every day. The soldiers said, "The more sweat we shed, the more happiness the Korean people will have." They organized many agricultural assistance teams, bringing their own dry food and walking more than ten li to help the Korean people with spring plowing. Many troops close to the front lines worked hard despite the threat of enemy shells, and helped residents without cattle to plow the land manually. The commanders and fighters of a certain unit braved the biting cold and moved stones in the rapids to build dams, working 14,000 shifts in ten days and building 3,000 meters of dams, which could irrigate 3,000 mu of land.

This sincere assistance from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was sincerely appreciated by the Korean people. Zhao Shuhua, a disaster victim in a certain place, said after receiving relief grain: "Every bite I eat, I think about it, and I can't forget Chairman Mao and the Volunteer Army." A disaster victim in a certain place wanted to keep a little of the relief grain on his body until death to show his gratitude. When the troops were cultivating in the fields, many women and children formed comfort teams, delivering water and cigarettes, dancing, and singing for the soldiers. The Women's League in a certain place organized women to cut horse grass for the troops and wash the clothes and bedding of the wounded and sick soldiers. The people in a certain place decided to name the dam built by the Volunteer Army the "Sino-Korean International Friendship Dam" and engraved it on a stone tablet in Chinese and Korean as a permanent memorial.

Encouraged by this internationalist action of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the enthusiasm of the Korean people for actively producing and supporting the front lines has been further enhanced. After receiving relief grain, the people of Shanzhi Village in a certain county immediately held a mass meeting and unanimously passed a resolution to resolutely complete the spring farming task and strive to increase production to support the front lines. The members of the Democratic Youth League in Guangyan Village in a certain place organized a night production commando team and put forward the guarantee of "no wasteland left uncultivated." After the Volunteer Army helped the people produce in a certain county, the cultivated area was expanded compared with the past, not only eliminating the fallow land, but also newly opening up a lot of wasteland. The deputy chairman of a certain county gratefully said: "The Volunteer Army has not only helped the masses, but also educated the masses. The people of our entire county will definitely step up production, strive to support the front lines, and strive for an early victory!"

    志愿军节约粮食二百多万斤救济朝鲜灾民
    【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】中国人民志愿军为了帮助朝鲜人民克服美国侵略者给他们造成的各种困难，特于今年三月下旬起在全军范围内普遍展开了节约粮食救济朝鲜灾民和帮助朝鲜人民进行春耕生产的工作。据极不完全的统计，到五月中旬时，全军共节约粮食二百四十五万多斤；部队已帮助朝鲜人民耕地十三万一千多亩（折合我国市亩，下同）；播种一万二千多亩；开荒一千一百亩；施肥三千多亩；送粪四十五万一千一百八十七担又九万八千八百多筐；全军并在“像建设祖国一样地来帮助朝鲜建设”的口号下，以高度的劳动热情为朝鲜人民修建水利工程。据不完全统计，全军共修水渠一百多条，长十万多公尺；筑坝四十多处，长八千多公尺；另外还修建了许多水闸、水库、蓄水池等。清明前后，全军并在各地植树五百多万株。
    中国人民志愿军的全体指挥员、战斗员们在这伟大的国际主义行动中表现了最高的积极性和最大的热情。战士们说：“朝鲜人民的困难就是我们的困难”、“抗美援朝是为了朝鲜人民的解放，现在他们有困难，我们有责任帮助解决。”
    在节约救灾工作中，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜地方政府共同组织了访问小组调查灾情，确定救济对象，评定救济等级，使粮食能够送到最需要的人手里。
    四月中旬春耕开始时，中部和东部前线大雪纷飞，战士们冒着风雪，不顾寒冷，每天坚持在田野中耕作八小时，战士们说：“咱们多流一滴汗，朝鲜人民便多一分幸福。”他们组织了许多助耕大队，自己带着干粮，走到十多里路以外的地方帮助朝鲜人民春耕。接近前线的许多部队，不顾敌人炮弹的威胁奋力耕作，并帮助没有牛力的居民用人力翻地。某部的指挥员、战斗员们冒刺骨的寒冷在激流中搬石头修坝，十天中出工一万四千个，修成水坝三千公尺，可以灌溉三千亩田地。
    中国人民志愿军这种赤诚的帮助，受到了朝鲜人民的衷心感激。某地灾民赵淑华得到救济粮后说：“我吃一口，想一想，不能忘了毛主席和志愿军。”某地一个灾民要把救济粮放一点在身上至死不丢以志不忘。当部队在田中耕作时，许多妇女和儿童组成了慰问队，为战士们送水、送烟、跳舞、唱歌。某地女性同盟组织妇女给部队割马草和拆洗伤病员的衣被。某地人民决定将志愿军修的水坝命名为“中朝国际友谊坝”，并用中、朝两国文字刻在石碑上，作为永久纪念。
    在中国人民志愿军这种国际主义行动的鼓舞下，朝鲜人民积极生产、支援前线的热情更为提高。某郡山旨里的人民领到救济粮后，立即召开群众大会，一致通过了坚决完成春耕任务，并争取增加生产来支援前线。某地广岩里的民主青年同盟盟员组织了夜间生产突击队，提出了“不荒一寸土地”的保证。某郡在志愿军帮助人民生产以后，耕地面积较前扩大，不但消灭了熟荒，而且新开了不少荒地。某郡的副委员长感激地说：“志愿军不但帮助了群众，而且教育了群众，我们全郡人民一定加紧生产，努力支援前线，争取早日胜利！”
