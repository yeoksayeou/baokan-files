Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 22nd: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front issued an appeal on the 18th, protesting the U.S. aggressors' planned indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities and towns in northern Korea, the bloody atrocities of mass murdering peaceful residents, and calling on the people of the world to stop these atrocities.

The appeal first pointed out: The U.S. imperialists, because of their military failures on the front lines, and because their conspiracy to force our side to accept their unreasonable demands at the Kaesong armistice talks finally went bankrupt, have created new atrocities against the Korean people that are even more cruel than those of the Hitlerite executioners.

While using napalm bombs, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons, the U.S. interventionists, in violation of all international laws and regulations, have also committed unprecedented atrocities in the Geoje Island and other POW camps in South Korea against our captured personnel, such as cruel torture, humiliation, and massacres.

These atrocities committed by the U.S. interventionists during the armistice negotiations show that the U.S. imperialists, who are reaping huge profits from the blood and suffering of the Korean people, are unwilling to see peace in Korea.

This can also be proven by the statement made by the U.S. executioner General Clark in early August of this year. This statement, which openly exposed the intentions of the U.S. aggressors, even clamored for the complete destruction of our seventy-eight cities from the air. This new inhuman plan was drafted by the Truman butchers. They vainly attempt to eliminate our people.

The appeal emphasized: In fact, the U.S. murderous devils had already begun this beastly plan long before this statement was issued, between May and June of this year. Now all the facts can prove that this plan is still being carried out.

The appeal pointed out: The facts also prove that the Truman butchers not only target the seventy-eight peaceful cities that they listed and falsely accused as "military objectives" for bombing, but also indiscriminately bomb all Korean cities and thousands of large and small peaceful villages, even small thatched cottages in remote areas. At the same time, they are also systematically destroying our valuable cultural constructions and historical heritage, as well as fields, orchards, and forests, which have no military significance.

The appeal listed the facts of the U.S. air pirates' bloody atrocities in destroying peaceful cities and towns and slaughtering large numbers of peaceful residents in Korea in the past three months.

The appeal pointed out: However, the U.S. aggressors cannot threaten our people, nor can they frustrate our will to resist. No weapon can destroy our people's fighting spirit and our desire for freedom and independence.

The U.S. aggressors' aim will not be achieved. Because we have the spiritual support and material assistance of the entire democratic camp led by the great Soviet Union, and the great, heroic Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting alongside us. The sympathy of progressive people all over the world is also on our side.

The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front has issued many statements, strongly protesting the atrocities committed by the U.S. interventionists in Korea and their violations of various provisions of international law.

The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, on behalf of all political parties and social organizations under its banner and all the Korean people, once again protests with unparalleled anger against the U.S. aircraft's beastly bombing of peaceful cities and towns in Korea, killing innocent peaceful residents, and blindly destroying peaceful facilities.

The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front protests against the new aerial atrocities committed by the U.S. military command in Korea and its plan to completely destroy our seventy-eight peaceful cities, and resolutely demands an immediate cessation of the bombing and strafing of our peaceful cities, rural areas, and other peaceful facilities.

The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front calls on all freedom-loving people around the world to resolutely demand an immediate end to the atrocities that are causing tragic bloodshed to the Korean people.

The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front is convinced that the direct organizers and executors of the unprecedented atrocities committed by U.S. aircraft against peaceful residents in Korea—U.S. war criminals—will be judged by good people all over the world and will be subject to due legal sanctions.

### 朝鲜祖国战线发表告全世界人民的呼吁书  抗议侵朝美军滥炸朝鲜和平城乡

    朝鲜祖国战线发表告全世界人民的呼吁书
    抗议侵朝美军滥炸朝鲜和平城乡
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会十八日发表呼吁书，抗议美国侵略者有计划地滥炸朝鲜北部和平城乡，大量杀害和平居民的血腥暴行，并呼吁全世界人民制止这种暴行。
    呼吁书首先指出：美帝国主义者因为在前线遭到军事上的失败，因为它在开城停战谈判桌上强要我方接受其无理主张的阴谋终于破产，于是就对朝鲜人民制造了比希特勒刽子手还要残酷的新暴行。
    美国干涉者在使用凝固汽油弹、化学武器及细菌武器的同时，并违反着一切国际公法和规定，在巨济岛及南朝鲜其他俘虏营里对我方被俘人员制造了残酷的拷问、凌辱及集体屠杀等史无前例的暴行。
    美国干涉者在停战谈判进行期中所制造的这种种暴行表明：从朝鲜人民的鲜血和痛苦中攫取着巨大利润的美帝国主义者是不愿意朝鲜和平的。
    这从美国刽子手将军克拉克在今年八月初发表的声明中也可以得到证明。这个公开地暴露了美国侵略者意图的声明，竟扬言要从空中全面破坏我们的七十八个城市。这个新的灭绝人性的计划，是杜鲁门屠夫们拟订的。他们妄想消灭我们人民。
    呼吁书着重指出：事实上，美国杀人魔鬼们在发表这个声明的很久以前，在今年五、六月间就已着手进行这一兽性的计划。现在我们所有的事实可以证明这个计划仍在被执行着。
    呼吁书指出：事实还证明杜鲁门屠夫们不但以他们所列举和诬指为“军事目标”的七十八个和平城市作为其轰炸对象，而且对所有朝鲜城市和数千个大小和平村庄，甚至对穷乡僻壤的小草房也肆行了盲目的轰炸。同时还有计划地在破坏着我们没有任何军事意义的宝贵的文物建设与历史遗产，以及田地果园及山林等。
    呼吁书列举了美国空中强盗在最近三个月中毁灭朝鲜和平城乡、屠杀大批和平居民的血腥暴行的事实。
    呼吁书指出：但是，美国侵略者们是威胁不了我们人民，同时也绝对不能挫折我们的反抗意志的。没有任何武器能够摧毁我们人民的斗志和我们争取自由独立的意愿。
    美国侵略者的目的是达不到的。因为我们有着以伟大的苏联为首的整个民主阵营的精神支持与物质援助，并有伟大的、英雄的中国人民志愿军和我们一道战斗。全世界进步人士的同情也在我们这一边。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会曾多次发表声明，严重抗议美国干涉者在朝鲜所制造的暴行，以及它们违反国际公法各项规定的行为。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会，代表在它旗帜下的全体政党与社会团体以及全朝鲜人民，以无比愤怒再一次抗议美国飞机野兽般地轰炸朝鲜和平城乡，杀害无辜的和平居民，盲目地破坏和平设施的暴行。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会抗议侵朝美军司令部所制造的新的空中暴行和企图完全毁灭我们七十八个和平城市的计划，并坚决要求立即停止对我们的和平城市农村与其他和平设施的轰炸与扫射。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会呼吁全世界爱好自由的人民坚决要求迅速停止使朝鲜人民遭受悲惨流血的暴行。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会确信：美国飞机对朝鲜和平居民所制造的史无前例的暴行的直接组织者与执行者——美国战犯，必将受到全世界善良人士的审判，必将受到应得的法律制裁。
