    All Kinds of Pesticides Should Be Strictly Guarded

    To the Editor: I read the letter from comrades Li Huazhang and Liu Huixu suggesting "Strictly Guarding 1605 Insecticide" in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on August 7th, and I think this suggestion is very correct. But as far as I know, most pesticides have varying degrees of danger to humans and animals, so they should all be strictly guarded to prevent accidental poisoning by humans and animals. At the same time, the dosage should also be carefully noted, as too much or too little is not appropriate. Too much will damage the crops, too little will not kill the pests, and it will also waste manpower and material resources. Therefore, it is very necessary to do a good job in publicizing and explaining the use of pesticides. I suggest that all localities pay attention to the above two points.

    各种农药都应严格保管
    编辑同志：八月七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了李化章、刘惠续两同志建议“严格保管一六○五杀虫药”的来信，我觉得这个建议很对。但据我所知，极大部分农药对于人畜都有程度不同的危险性，所以应当一律加以严格保管，以免人畜误食中毒。同时，用药分量也要十分注意，过多过少都不合适。过多会毁伤了庄稼，过少不能杀灭害虫，而且耗费了人力、物力。因此，做好使用农药的宣传解释工作是十分必要的。建议各地注意以上两点。
