Radio broadcasting is enthusiastically welcomed by the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army. It is a modern tool for the People's Liberation Army to carry out political work.

As early as before Japan's surrender, when the Xinhua Broadcasting Station was first established in Yan'an, the People's Liberation Army first heard Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's order to counterattack from the radio. Broadcasting became a battle horn to encourage the troops to advance bravely. During the great People's Liberation War, radio broadcasting played a huge role in explaining the situation, conveying new tasks, announcing the Party's policies, publishing victories, boosting morale, and carrying out propaganda to disintegrate the Kuomintang army to the troops fighting across the country to liberate all of China. With the victory of the People's Liberation War and the development of the people's radio broadcasting, the radio broadcast reception work of the People's Liberation Army has also entered a new stage. According to the "Instructions on Establishing Military Radio Broadcasting and Reception Networks" issued by the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission on April 16, 1951, the military has vigorously strengthened the leadership and construction of this work, establishing widespread reception networks. To meet the special needs of the troops, the Central People's Broadcasting Station has been running a nationwide "Military Program" since May 1951, widely disseminating heroic deeds, talks by heroic model figures, and providing the troops with a large amount of political and cultural learning materials. The number of radios in the military has increased countless times compared to the Liberation War period. In addition to units above the regiment level, some battalions and companies have also set up radios. Some units have also established radio repair factories. All military regions have equipped and rotated full-time or part-time radio operators. The military radio broadcast reception work has been developing vigorously.

It is understood that the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front, because they cannot see newspapers in time, have also set up a large number of radios, taking radio broadcasting as an aerial supply line of spiritual food. On the Korean front, soldiers pay close attention to listening to the voice of the motherland in front of loudspeakers and radios. Sometimes, when the battle situation makes it impossible to listen to the broadcast, political workers and radio operators transcribe the broadcast news, print it into various mimeographed telegrams, leaflets, and pamphlets, and distribute them in trenches, command posts, or supply stations. Whether during peacetime or during breaks after the end of a battle, soldiers habitually take out small newspapers from their pockets, and several people gather together to happily recite news about war victories and the construction of the motherland. The soldiers guarding Maliang Mountain composed a quick-rhythm poem for the telegram newsletter: "News telegrams have arrived, comrades all come to see, one person reads and everyone listens, listens clearly and remembers firmly, news of victory keeps spreading, the wave of motherland construction is high, everything is available in politics and economy, and there is no lack of international news, although we are in the cave, we know everything about the world." The soldiers fighting on Tiande Mountain and Yuefeng Mountain listened with unparalleled excitement to the news that their heroic battles to defend the great motherland and defend world peace were being broadcast to the world by the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing, which boosted their spirits and encouraged them to diligently and exemplarily assume their glorious duties. The comrades who performed meritorious service this time said: "Our achievements have been announced to the world by Chairman Mao, and people all over the world know that we have made contributions to defend world peace and democracy, we must always maintain this glory!"

Radio broadcasting often plays a role in promoting the fighting tasks of the troops. On New Year's Day this year, the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army heard Commander Peng Dehuai's New Year's letter to all commanders and fighters on the radio, and expressed one after another: "Commander Peng wants us to save for the motherland, so that every grain of rice and every bullet can play a role, we must never waste a single thread of the people of the motherland!" In the struggle against germ warfare, the commanders and fighters of the troops not only heard on the radio the heinous crimes of American imperialism in using bacteriological weapons, but also learned epidemic prevention and hygiene knowledge, strengthening the confidence of the commanders and fighters in the struggle against germ warfare.

The People's Liberation Army troops in China have also achieved great results and achievements in radio broadcast reception work. The troops stationed on the border of the motherland, on this year's "May Day" Labor Day, listened to Comrade Liu Ningyi's report: "...buildings are being built one after another in the motherland..." The soldiers could not help but say: "We must step up learning modern technology and command art, improve our cultural level, and always be vigilant against the mad dog of American imperialism! Strive to defend the security of the motherland and defend the sacred territory!" When they heard the live recording of the "May Day" grand review in the capital, and Chairman Mao stepped onto the reviewing stand, the soldiers immediately applauded and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" with joy.

Radio broadcasting has also played a significant role in guiding cultural studies. The accelerated literacy method broadcast by the "Military Program" and the speeches by heroic model figures on the cultural front have powerfully encouraged the troops' enthusiasm for learning culture. The soldiers listened and took notes at the same time. Wang Jiwen, a soldier of a certain guard company, said: "We can listen to news and learn culture at the same time, radio is really good." Some soldiers learned several hundred new characters and how to use them by listening to and recording the news two or three times. Some comrades have also learned how to use punctuation marks.

In terms of enlivening the cultural life of the troops, radio broadcasting's entertainment programs have also played a significant role. Some troops listen to radio broadcasts teaching songs, drum songs, quick rhythm, short song and dance dramas, songs, etc., and the soldiers sing along as they listen. When they hear dance music, the soldiers dance along with the music. The soldiers composed a quick-rhythm poem for the radio: "The radio is a magic weapon, with songs, dramas, Bangzi operas, Lianhualuo, it is indispensable for enlivening the troops."

Not only that, in order to make broadcasting easier to connect with the masses and educate the masses, in the past six months, many organs, schools, and hospitals have also established wired broadcasting to rebroadcast programs from the Central Station and local stations and broadcast military programs specially needed by their units. At present, the wired broadcasting run by the Northeast Military Region has loudspeakers in about one-third of the units in the military region. Wired broadcasting can cooperate with the actual work of the unit, carry out propaganda and mobilization according to the timetable of the unit, and organize listening widely and universally. It has become a powerful tool for issuing orders, mobilizing the masses, exchanging experiences, introducing situations, publicizing heroic model deeds, promoting criticism and self-criticism, correcting work shortcomings, and carrying out cultural activities. For example, a hospital in the Northeast Military Region is equipped with a 200-watt amplifier, more than 100 records, and a total of 92 loudspeakers have been installed throughout the hospital, with a line length of 7,000 meters. The broadcasting time is three times a day (a total of three and a half hours). In addition to simulcasting the news programs, "Military Programs" and literary and art programs of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, the programs "Hospital Life," "Ward Learning," "Current Affairs Talks," "Hygiene Talks," and "Singing Teaching" have been held successively according to the needs of the hospital's central tasks in various periods. From time to time, according to the needs of the hospital's work, the hospital leaders or typical figures are invited to broadcast reports.

Because wired broadcasting is very popular among the masses, everyone collects materials and writes manuscripts. Many comrades from worker-peasant backgrounds with low cultural levels have significantly improved their writing skills after several months of manuscript writing exercises, which has also increased their confidence in learning culture.

In the future, in order to enable the largest number of soldiers in the armed forces to directly listen to radio broadcasts, and to make the broadcast content more suitable for the urgent needs of the troops, we must continue to work hard to strengthen this powerful tool for propaganda and mobilization!

Soldiers have learned a lot of political, cultural, scientific knowledge and new songs from the radio; listening to the radio has gradually become an indispensable part of their daily spiritual life. This is a scene where soldiers of a guard company of a certain unit in East China Military Region, during entertainment time, gather in groups of three or five to go to the club to listen to the radio.

    蓬勃发展中的部队广播收音工作
    叶家林
    无线电广播是受到人民解放军广大指战员们热烈欢迎的。它是人民解放军进行政治工作的一个现代化的工具。
    远在日本投降前，当延安开始创立了新华广播电台时，人民解放军首先就从广播中听到朱总司令发布的反攻命令，广播就成为鼓舞部队奋勇前进的战斗号角。在伟大的人民解放战争期间，无线电广播向南征北战、解放全国的广大部队阐明斗争形势，传达新的任务，宣布党的政策，发表捷报，鼓舞士气，以及进行瓦解国民党军队的宣传工作，都产生了巨大作用。随着人民解放战争的胜利和人民无线电广播事业的发展，人民解放军的广播收音工作也进入了一个新阶段。根据中央军委总政治部一九五一年四月十六日“关于建立部队无线电广播及收音网的指示”，部队大力地加强了对这一工作的领导和建设，建立广泛的收音网。为了满足部队的特殊需要，中央人民广播电台从一九五一年五月起举办了全军性的“部队节目”，广泛地传播英雄事迹，英雄模范人物的谈话，以及供给部队以大量政治、文化学习材料。部队收音机的数量比解放战争时期增加了不知多少倍。除了团以上单位之外，有些营连也设置了收音机。有的单位还成立了收音机装修工厂。各军区部队都已经配备了和轮训了专职或兼职的收音员。部队无线电广播收音工作得到了蓬勃的发展。
    据了解，在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军部队的广大指战员们，因为不能及时地看到报纸，也已经设置了大量的收音机，把无线电广播当成为空中精神食粮的供应线。在朝鲜前线战士们十分注意地在喇叭、收音机前收听祖国的声音。有时由于战斗情况不可能收听广播时，政治工作人员和收音员便将广播新闻抄录下来，印成各种各样的油印电讯、传单、小册子，散发在战壕、指挥所或兵站。战士们不管在平时或战斗刚结束的休息时间，就习惯地从口袋里掏出小报，几个人围在一起愉快地朗诵有关战争胜利消息和祖国建设的消息。坚守在马良山的战士们给电讯小报编了一首快板诗说：“新闻电讯送到了，同志们都来瞧，一人念大家听，听得清记得牢，胜利消息传不断，祖国建设浪潮高，政治经济样样有，国际新闻也不少，别看咱们在洞里，天下大事都知道。”战斗在天德山、月烽山的战士们以无比兴奋的心情来倾听自己为保卫伟大祖国，为保卫世界和平而英勇战斗的战绩从北京中央人民广播电台向全世界广播时，不禁精神振奋，益加奋勉而模范地担负起自己光荣的职务。在这次立功的同志们说：“我们的战绩已由毛主席那里向全世界公布了，全世界人民都知道我们为保卫世界和平民主而立了功勋，我们要永远保持着这个光荣！”
    对于部队的斗争任务，无线电广播经常起推动作用。今年元旦，志愿军指战员们从无线电广播上听到了彭德怀司令员给全体指战员的贺年信，纷纷表示：“彭司令员要我们为祖国节约，使每一粒米，每一颗子弹能都发挥作用，咱们绝对不要浪费祖国人民一针一线！”在反对细菌战的斗争中，部队指战员们不仅从广播上听到全世界人民反对美帝国主义使用细菌武器的滔天罪行，而且还学习了防疫卫生知识，加强了指战员们的反细菌战的斗争信心。
    国内的人民解放军部队，在无线电广播收听工作上，也有了很大的效果和建树。驻守在祖国边疆的部队，今年“五一”劳动节收听刘宁一同志的报告：“……祖国的楼房一所一所建立起来了……”战士们情不自禁地说：“我们要加紧学习现代化技术和指挥艺术，提高文化水平，时刻警惕美帝国主义这条疯狗！为保卫祖国安全，保卫神圣的领土而奋斗！”当收听到“五一”首都大检阅实况录音，毛主席走上检阅台时，战士们立即以欢欣鼓舞的心情，鼓掌高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    无线电广播在辅导文化学习方面也起了很大作用：“部队节目”广播的速成识字法和在文化战线上的英雄模范人物的讲话，都有力地鼓舞着部队学习文化的热情。战士们一边收听一边笔记。某警卫连战士王吉文说：“又听新闻，又能学文化，无线电真是好。”有的战士通过两三次的收听记录新闻，就学会了好几百个生字，并且学会了使用。有些同志还学会了标点符号用法。
    在活跃部队文化生活方面，无线电广播文娱节目也起了很大作用。有些部队收听无线电广播教唱、大鼓、快板、小歌舞剧、歌曲等，战士们听着听着就随声唱起来。听到游戏舞曲的时候，战士们就随着音乐跳起来。战士们给收音机编了一首快板诗：“收音机是法宝，有歌曲，有戏剧，有梆子，莲花落，活跃部队少不了。”
    不仅如此，部队为使广播更易于联系群众，教育群众，近半年来很多机关、学校、医院还创办了有线电广播，来转播中央台、地方台节目和播送本单位特殊需要的部队节目。目前东北军区办的有线电广播，拥有扩音器的单位就约占军区部队的三分之一强。有线电广播能够配合本单位的各项实际工作，按照本单位的时间表进行宣传鼓动，普遍广泛地组织收听。它成为发布号令、动员群众、交流经验、介绍情况、宣传英雄模范事迹、发扬批评与自我批评和改正工作缺点及开展文化活动的有力工具。如东北军区某医院装有二百瓦特的扩音器一台，唱片一百多张，全院共安了九十二个喇叭，线路长达七千多公尺。每天播音时间三次（共三小时半）。除了联播中央人民广播电台的新闻节目、“部队节目”和文艺节目以外，并根据该院各个时期中心任务的需要，先后举办的节目有：“医院生活”、“病房学习”、“时事漫谈”、“卫生讲话”、“教歌”等节目。也时常根据医院的工作需要，邀请医院首长或典型人物来广播报告。
    由于有线电广播很受群众欢迎，大家纷纷搜集材料写稿，有很多文化水平较低的工农出身的同志，经过几个月写稿锻炼，写作水平有了显著的提高，因而也提高了他们学习文化的信心。
    今后，为了要使无线电广播能让最大数量的武装部队战士直接收听，并使广播内容更加适合部队的迫切需要，我们还须继续努力，加强这个宣传鼓动的强有力的工具！
