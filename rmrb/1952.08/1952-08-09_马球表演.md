    Polo Performance
    Shucun
    A burst of warm applause greeted a team of lively riders. - The "Polo" performance officially began. This was a brilliant program of the "August 1st" Army Day sports meeting on August 6th.
    In the middle of a field 280 meters long and 100 meters wide, the riders, divided into two teams of four, formed opposing lines - the left team, black horses and yellow jerseys; the right team, white horses and red jerseys. The sturdy riders wore helmets and riding boots, and held two-foot-long T-shaped mallets. The two teams were positioned in a battle array.
    The referee threw a snow-white wooden ball, less than ten centimeters in diameter, in the middle of the two teams, and the riders spurred their horses and waved their mallets, chasing and galloping. The white ball was hit hard by the mallets, rolling on the ground, sometimes east, sometimes west - the two teams engaged in a fierce battle. As soon as the ball game started, the White Horse team launched a bold offensive. Riders "1" and "2" of the White Horse team swung their mallets, hitting the white ball, heading straight for the Black Horse team's goal. Just as the wooden ball was rolling towards the Black Horse team's goal, rider "4" of the brave and agile Black Horse team spurred his horse towards the wooden ball and knocked the ball away with a blow. Then the members of the Black Horse team turned from defense to attack, and in one fell swoop, approached the opponent's goal, taking the opportunity to hit a goal, winning the first point. The ball game became even more intense, and eight steeds, under the control of the riders, galloped across the field, the snow-white wooden ball being hit sometimes west, sometimes east. Suddenly, the members of the White Horse team, chasing the ball quickly, inserted themselves into the Black Horse team's territory, unexpectedly hitting the ball into the White Horse team's goal, also scoring a point. The two teams were evenly matched, fighting more and more bravely. The whole audience constantly cheered for their superior horsemanship and brave, agile movements. The result of the ball game was seven to six, with the White Horse team taking the lead.
    "Polo" is a sport that can train people's courage and agility; at the same time, it can also train the horse's high impulse. In the game, the horse completely follows the will of the person, sometimes galloping wildly, sometimes turning sharply, but no matter how fierce the horse runs or how sharp it turns, the rider on the horse wields the mallet, hitting and hooking gently back and forth, riding the horse as if walking on flat ground. Therefore, polo has been listed as one of the sports projects for exercising the body and defending the motherland.
    The polo team members who participated in the performance were all from worker and peasant backgrounds. During the practice period, they displayed a high degree of creativity and hard work. Without balls, they made them themselves; in the Mongolian winter, the wind and sand made it impossible to see people and horses beyond ten steps, the players' hands were frozen and their faces were swollen by the sand, but this could not diminish their enthusiasm for practicing polo. Under the diligent study and hard practice of all the team members and the patient guidance of the "polo" coaches, they quickly mastered the "polo" skills. On July 1st this year, at the "Nadam" conference on the Chahar Mingtai Banner grassland, they gave their first performance and received enthusiastic praise from the audience. The riders of the polo team felt very honored to come to the capital to perform this time. They said: "For the security of the motherland and world peace, we must work harder in the future."

    马球表演
    树村
    一阵热烈的掌声，迎出一队生龙活虎的骑手。——“马球”表演正式开始。这是“八一”建军节体育运动大会八月六日的一个精彩节目。
    骑手们在一个二百八十公尺长，一百公尺宽的场子正中，四乘一队的分作两队——左边一队，黑马黄衣；右边一队，白马红衣。健壮的骑手们，头戴圆盔，脚登马靴，手中持一根二尺长丁字形的球杖。两队摆成了对战的阵势。
    裁判员把一个直径不到十公分的雪白的木球，抛在两队中间，骑手们便策马挥杖，追逐着、狂奔着。白球被拐杖猛击，在地上飞滚，忽儿往东，忽儿往西——两队展开了激烈的争夺战。球战一开始，白马队首先发动了勇猛的攻势。白马队的“1”“2”号骑手挥舞着球杖，猛击着白球，直逼黑马队球门。正当木球滚向黑马队球门时，勇敢、机敏的黑马队“4”号骑手，策马奔向木球，一杖把球击走，接着黑马队的队员们便转守为攻，一鼓作气，逼近对方球门，趁机击入一球，旗开得胜，赢得一分。球战更加紧张，八匹骏马，随着骑手们的操纵，奔跑在广场上，雪白的木球，被击得忽西忽东。忽然，白马队的队员们，飞快地追着球，插入黑马队的腹地，出其不意，将球击进白马队球门，也得一分。两队势均力敌，越战越勇。全场观众，不断为他们优越的骑术和勇敢、机敏的动作而欢呼。球赛的结果是七比六，白马队占先。
    “马球”是一种能锻炼人的勇敢、机敏的运动；同时它还能锻炼马的高度冲力。在打球中，马完全随了人的意志，忽儿狂奔，忽儿急转，但无论马跑得多猛，转得多急，骑手在马上，挥动球杖，前后左右猛击缓抅，乘马如走平地。因此马球已被列为锻炼体格、保卫祖国的体育项目之一。
    参加表演的马球队员们，都是工农出身。在练习期间，发挥了高度的创造性和艰苦精神。没有球，他们自己动手做；蒙古的寒冬，风沙刮得十步以外就看不见人和马，队员们的手冻僵了，脸被沙子打肿，但也丝毫不能降低他们的练球热情。在全体队员的勤学苦练和“马球”教练者的耐心指导下，他们很快就掌握了“马球”技术。今年七月一日，在察哈尔明太旗草原的“那达慕”大会上，他们作了首次表演，受到观众的热烈赞赏。马球队的骑手们这次来到首都表演，都感到十分光荣。他们说：“为了祖国的安全与世界和平，我们今后更要加倍努力。”
