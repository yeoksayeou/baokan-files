    For the Children, For the Motherland
    I took the train from Beijing to Tangshan. I was late, and all the seats on the train were occupied. I put down my bedding roll and stood leaning against a chair.
    "Uncle Liberation Army, give me your bedding roll and come over here!" I was wiping sweat with my handkerchief when I heard a child calling to me. I turned around and saw two girls: the older one was twelve or thirteen, and the younger one was about ten, both wearing red scarves around their necks. The older girl snatched my bedding roll, and the younger girl jumped over, grabbed my hand, and shouted, pulling me along: "Uncle Liberation Army, come on, come on, sit over there with us!" Their pure enthusiasm made it impossible for me to refuse them.
    I sat in the seat, and the two children sat on my lap. They clung to me as if they were seeing a long-lost relative.
    The older girl told me that her name was Wang Runzhi, and her younger sister was Wang Runchao. They both studied at an elementary school in Beijing. Now that school was on summer vacation, they were going home to see their mother.
    I asked them about their studies. Runchao reached out and touched my badge, saying, "Uncle Liberation Army, the teacher teaches us to read, to learn about current events, to sing, to dance, and also takes us on trips... Oh! Right, we also have discussions! In the meeting, everyone said that we must do a good job of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers!"
    I deliberately asked her, "Why is that?" "Huh! Why?" She stared at me with wide eyes and said, "If it weren't for the Volunteer Army and Liberation Army uncles defending the motherland, would we still be able to study peacefully in school?"
    I touched their hair and asked, "Do you love the Volunteer Army?"
    As soon as "Volunteer Army" was mentioned, they became extremely excited and scrambled to say, "I love them! I love them!" Runchao started singing the Volunteer Army battle song. Runzhi shook my hand vigorously and said, "I wrote three letters of comfort to the Volunteer Army uncles and also sent a photo. My letter went like this: Dear Volunteer Army Uncles: When I was little, the Japanese devils occupied my home and wouldn't let me know my beloved motherland. Today, the American devils want to seize my home again and invade our motherland. You are bravely defending our motherland at the front, and I will study hard at home and help the families of revolutionary soldiers with their work. I hope you uncles win more great victories in Korea..." Runchao also said, "We saved up the money our mother gave us for candy and donated it for airplanes and cannons to support the Volunteer Army uncles in fighting the American devils." Runzhi continued, "I also swept the yard for the family of a revolutionary soldier, and my sister danced a Ukrainian dance for the family of a revolutionary soldier."
    The children were so lovely. I asked, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
    "Be a Liberation Army soldier, kill the enemies, and defend our homes and country!" It seemed that they had already thought about this maturely, and they both said it together. They took my military cap from the hook, put it on their heads, and sang the song "Wearing the August 1st Military Cap."
    After getting off the train and walking on the road, my heart was filled with a new strength, and I felt even more the weight of my responsibility. For the children, for the new motherland, I must work hard, study actively, accelerate the mastery of modern military technology, and strengthen national defense. Bi Fuyu

    为了孩子，为了祖国
    我从北京乘火车到唐山去。我来得晚了，车上的座位里都坐满了人。我放下被包，靠着椅子站着。
    “解放军叔叔，给我被包，到我们这儿来！”我正拿着手巾擦汗，听到一个孩子在招呼我。我掉过头来看，原来是两个女孩子：大的十二三，小的十来岁，两个人脖子上都围着红领巾。那个大孩子抢走了我的被包，小孩子跳过来抓住我的手，连拉带喊：“解放军叔叔，走，走，坐到我们那里去！”她们那种纯真的热情，使我不能拒绝她们。
    我坐在座位上两个孩子坐在我的腿上。她们像是见了多年未见的亲人似的，紧紧地靠在我的怀里。
    大的女孩子告诉我，她叫王润芝，她妹妹叫王润潮。她们都在北京一个小学读书。现在学校放暑假，她们回家去看妈妈。
    我问起她们学习的情况。润潮伸手弄着我的胸章，说：“解放军叔叔，老师教我们识字，学时事，唱歌，跳舞，还领我们去旅行……。噢！对啦，我们还开讨论会！会上，大家都说，要好好拥军优属呢！”
    我故意问她：“这是为什么？”“咦！为什么？”她瞪着眼睛看我，说：“要没有志愿军和解放军叔叔们保卫祖国，我们还能安稳地在学校里念书吗？”
    我摸着她们的头发，问：“你们爱志愿军吗？”
    一提起“志愿军”，她们兴奋极了，抢着说：“我爱！我爱！”润潮唱起了志愿军战歌。润芝用力摇着我的手说：“我给志愿军叔叔们写了三封慰问信，还寄了一张照片。我的信是这样写的：敬爱的志愿军叔叔：我小时候，日本鬼子占了我的家，不叫我知道我的可爱的祖国。今天，美国鬼子又想抢占我的家，侵略我们的祖国。你们在前方英勇地保卫着我们的祖国，我在家里要努力念书，好好帮助军属们干活。希望叔叔们在朝鲜多打大胜仗……。”润潮也说：“妈妈给我们的糖果钱，我们积起来，捐献了飞机大炮，支援志愿军叔叔们打美国鬼子。”润芝又接着说：“我还给军属扫过院子，我妹妹给军属跳了个乌克兰舞。”
    孩子们太可爱了。我问：“你们长大了，想干什么？”
    “当解放军啊，杀敌人，保家卫国！”这件事她们好像早就考虑成熟了，两个人一齐说了出来。她们从挂钩上取下我的军帽，戴在头上，唱起“八一军帽头上戴”的歌。
    下车后，走在路上，我心里充满一股新的力量，我更加感到自己责任的重大。为了孩子，为了新生的祖国，我要努力工作，积极学习，加速掌握现代化的军事技术，增强国防力量。  毕复郁
