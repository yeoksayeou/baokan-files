The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture Holds Wheat Technology Conference
Summarizing Wheat High-Yield Experiences and Formulating Next Year's Production Increase Plan

To ensure a good wheat harvest in 1953, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture convened a provincial wheat technology conference on July 26th. More than 50 people attended the meeting, including the heads of provincial and district farms, key county farms, the Jinyuan mechanized farm, and agricultural technicians. The conference summarized the high-yield wheat experiences from various parts of the province and discussed and arranged the wheat production increase plan for 1953. Finally, Wu Guangtang, Director of the Department of Agriculture, gave a concluding report. In his report, he said: Although Shanxi suffered from natural disasters such as drought, wind, diseases, and insect pests this year, resulting in serious production reductions, many high-yield models still created new records for high-yield wheat production. According to incomplete statistics, the province has one high-yield village, six high-yield agricultural production cooperatives, forty-seven high-yield mutual aid teams, one hundred and thirty-five high-yield households, and one high-yield farm. In Xiajiluo Village, Zhao City, 305 households cultivated a total of 1067.55 mu of wheat fields, including 773 mu of irrigated land, with an average yield of 350 jin per mu, exceeding the surrounding villages by 16% to 40%; 10.88 mu of high-yield irrigated land yielded an average of 772.4 jin of wheat per mu. The Weimingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zaoyan Village, Wuxiang County, with 26 households, cultivated 14.3 mu of dry land with high-yield wheat, with an average yield of 450 jin per mu, including 1.964 mu of particularly high-yield land with an average yield of 774 jin per mu. In addition, a large number of high-yield models emerged through the appraisal movement. There were 20 households with over 500 jin per mu on irrigated land, including Zhang Deyou and Zhang Lacheng from Xiajiluo Village, Zhao City, and 9 households with over 400 jin per mu on dry land, including Li Qingshan from Daze Village, Wenxi County. Although the high-yield models were also affected by natural disasters and failed to fully achieve their expected goals, they still achieved high yields. This proves that natural disasters can be overcome. The reason they achieved high yields is mainly because they organized themselves to leverage collective wisdom and strength. More than 80% of the high-yield households are members of mutual aid teams. Another reason for the high yield is that all labor models participated in the patriotic production increase competition movement, continuously improving their political and ideological awareness and production enthusiasm. Their common high-yield experiences are: First, deep plowing to preserve moisture, and timely sowing. Especially this year's drought has shown the benefits of deep plowing to preserve moisture. Second, increase fertilizer application and pay attention to technology. The high-yield models applied sufficient fertilizer before plowing and sowing, and also applied top dressing during the growing season to ensure the mid-term development of wheat, so the wheat seedlings had strong resistance to diseases, insects, wind, and drought; especially applying un-decomposed and semi-decomposed fertilizer early before plowing, and deep plowing it into the ground to make it decompose in the soil and closely combine with the soil as soon as possible, which also helps to improve the soil and retain moisture. Third, narrow row spacing and dense planting. This is an extremely important factor in increasing the unit yield of wheat. Provincial farm dense planting experiments and the deeds of high-yield models have proved that narrow row spacing and dense planting of wheat can not only increase yield but also inhibit weed growth and retain moisture, and have the effect of preventing drought and resisting drought. Increasing the sowing width and increasing the amount of seeds sown can also increase production. The six high-yield models in Xiajiluo Village, Zhao City, who produced more than 700 jin per mu, had an average sowing rate of more than 19 jin per mu, and the highest sowing rate reached 22 jin per mu. Fourth, select good varieties. Advanced cultivation technology combined with planting excellent varieties is the main experience in creating high-yield records. According to a survey of 68 households in Xiajiluo Village, Zhao City, the high-yield land all used the Guanzhong White Wheat superior variety, which increased production by an average of 25.6% compared to the other five varieties.

After summarizing the high-yield experiences, the conference discussed and revised the 1953 wheat production increase and high-yield plan for each district: the province must strive to increase wheat production by 1 billion jin on the basis of the production reduction caused by disasters in 1952. To ensure the completion of the production increase task, it is necessary to cultivate models in a planned and leadership-led manner on the basis of organizing, establish high-yield banners, and comprehensively carry out the patriotic production increase movement. The following four points must be implemented technically: First, the plowing depth should generally be increased by one to two inches compared to the past. In areas without new-style walking plows, the use of tandem plowing for deep plowing is advocated. Second, the entire province should increase fertilizer application by 20% on the basis of 1952; and pay attention to fertilizer application technology, and advocate the method of applying fertilizer in stages. To ensure fertilizer increase, it is necessary to first organize the masses to use straw, bran, weeds, etc. to make compost, raise pigs for manure bedding, repair latrines, make kang soil, and suppress green manure. Third, implement narrow row spacing and dense planting, and increase the amount of seeds sown. The sowing rate per mu in irrigated land in Yuncheng and Linfen districts and the southeastern Jin area is set at 20 jin, and the sowing rate in dry land is set at 10 jin to 12 jin; the sowing rate per mu in irrigated land in Changzhi and Yuci districts is set at 20 jin, and the sowing rate in dry land is set at 12 jin to 20 jin; the sowing rate per mu in irrigated land in Xinxian district is set at 25 jin, and the sowing rate in dry land is set at 20 jin. State-owned farms in various places should first densely plant on large areas and take the lead in demonstrating, using concrete facts to break the farmers' conservative thinking. Fourth, universally promote seed selection and seed soaking, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests. First, promote the county's preliminary seed selection and the superior varieties recognized by the masses, and carry out mass seed exchange movements. In terms of disease and pest control, promote disease-resistant Bimai No. 1, No. 4 wheat, Gucheng Ying wheat, Baiyu wheat, and Ukrainian wheat; for loose smut, stinking smut, and nematode diseases, use variable temperature seed soaking, constant temperature seed soaking, medicinal seed mixing, salt water seed selection, and mud water filtration to prevent and control.

The harvest of this conference is, first of all, to further recognize the important significance of wheat production increase for strengthening national construction and improving people's lives from the perspective of guiding ideology, and to reverse the "emphasis on cotton and neglect of wheat" view in some areas. Secondly, through this conference, the masses' high-yield experiences were initially analyzed and studied, and a relatively scientific summary was made, and it was decided to promote it to the masses, and then improve it from practice, and implement the technical guidance route from the masses to the masses. Third, the production increase tasks and high-yield plans were determined, attention was paid to the general increase in production, and also attention was paid to striving for high-yield production, which pointed out the direction for guiding the agricultural production increase movement in the future.

    山西省农业厅召开小麦技术会议
    总结小麦丰产经验制订明年增产计划
    为了保证一九五三年小麦丰收，山西省人民政府农业厅在七月二十六日召开了全省小麦技术会议。参加会议的有省和专区的农场、重点县农场、晋源机耕农场的负责人及农业技术人员共五十多人。会议总结了全省各地小麦丰产经验，并讨论和布置了一九五三年小麦增产计划，最后由农业厅厅长武光汤做了总结报告。他在报告中说：今年山西各地虽然普遍遭受了旱、风、病、虫等自然灾害而严重减产，但仍然有很多丰产模范创造了小麦高额丰产新纪录。据不完全统计，全省有丰产村一个，丰产农业生产合作社六个，丰产互助组四十七个，丰产户一百三十五个，丰产农场一个。赵城下纪落村三百零五户共麦田一○六七·五五亩，其中水地七七三亩，每亩平均产量三百五十斤，超过周围村百分之十六至四十；丰产水地一○·八八亩，每亩产小麦七百七十二点四斤。武乡枣烟村魏明标农业生产合作社全社二十六户，共十四·三亩旱地丰产小麦，每亩平均产量四百五十斤，其中一·九六四亩特别丰产地每亩平均产七百七十四斤。此外通过评比运动并涌现出大批丰产模范，水地每亩五百斤以上者计有赵城下纪落村张德有、张拉成等二十户，旱地每亩四百斤以上者计有闻喜大泽村李清山等九户。丰产模范们虽然也受到自然灾害的影响未能完全达到预期的目的，但仍获得高额产量。这证明自然灾害是可以战胜的。他们得到丰产的原因，主要是由于组织起来发挥了集体的智慧和力量。丰产户中百分之八十以上都是互助组组员。丰产的又一原因是各个劳动模范都参加了爱国增产竞赛运动，不断地提高了政治思想觉悟和生产积极性。他们共同的丰产经验是：第一、深耕保墒，适时播种。特别是今年干旱，更显示了深耕保墒的好处。第二、增施肥料，讲究技术。丰产模范们在翻地和播种前就上了充足的肥料，在生长期又施了追肥，保证小麦中期发育，因而麦苗抵抗病、虫、风、旱的能力很强；尤其是耕前就早施未腐熟及半腐熟的肥料，深翻入地使它在土内分解，和土壤及早密切结合，这样也有助于土壤改良和水分保持。第三、窄行密植。这是小麦提高单位产量的极其重要的因素之一。省农场密植试验及丰产模范的事迹都证明小麦窄行密植不但能增加产量，还能制止杂草生长、保持水分，具有防旱抗旱效能。加宽播幅增加播种量也能增产，下纪落村每亩产七百斤以上的六个丰产模范，播种量平均每亩在十九斤以上，最高的每亩播种量达二十二斤。第四、选用良种。先进的耕作技术结合种植优良品种，是创造丰产纪录的主要经验。据赵城下纪落村六十八户调查，丰产地都选用了关中白麦优种，比其他五个品种平均增产百分之二十五点六。
    总结了丰产经验后，会议就讨论修订了一九五三年各专区小麦增产和丰产计划：全省要在一九五二年受灾减产的基础上为增产小麦十亿斤而奋斗。为了保证增产任务的完成，要在组织起来的基础上有计划有领导地培养模范，树立丰产旗帜，全面开展爱国增产运动。在技术上必须贯彻以下四点：第一、犁地一般要求比过去再加深一至二寸。无新式步犁的地区提倡用套犁法深耕。第二、全省要在一九五二年的基础上增肥百分之二十；并讲究施肥技术，提倡分期施肥办法。为了保证增肥，首先要组织群众利用秸杆麸糠杂草等制造堆肥，养猪垫圈，修茅坑，打炕土，压绿肥等。第三、实行窄行密植，增加播种量。运城、临汾两专区及晋东南部水地每亩播种量定为二十斤，旱地定为十斤至十二斤；长治、榆次二专区水地每亩播种量定为二十斤，旱地定为十二斤至二十斤；忻县专区水地每亩播种量定为二十五斤，旱地定为二十斤。各地国营农场首先在大面积上密植，起带头示范作用，用具体事实打破农民的保守思想。第四、普遍推行选种浸种，防治病虫。首先要推广县的初选种和群众公认的优良品种，开展群众性的优种互换运动。在防治病虫害方面，推广抗病力强的碧蚂一号、四号小麦、古城营小麦、白玉麦、乌克兰麦；对散黑穗病、腥黑穗病及线虫病等，用变温浸种、定温浸种、药剂拌种及盐水选种、泥水滤种等方法防治。
    这次会议的收获，首先是从领导思想上进一步认识了小麦增产对于加强国家建设和改善人民生活的重要意义，扭转了部分地区“重棉轻麦”的观点。其次，通过这次会议，初步地把群众的丰产经验进行了分析研究，作了比较科学的总结，并决定把它推广到群众中去，从实践中再加以提高，实行从群众中来到群众中去的技术指导路线。第三、确定了增产任务和丰产计划，注意了普遍的增产，也注意了争取高额的丰产，给今后指导农业增产运动指出了方向。（刘杰、郭石）
