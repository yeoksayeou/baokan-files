Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th: Progressive newspapers from various countries have unanimously condemned the US Air Force's sinister plan to bomb peaceful Korean towns on a large scale.

    The French "l'Humanité" commented on the 6th: "The Americans inhumanly announce a plan to massacre tens of thousands of civilians, women, and children, and then hypocritically pretend to warn of the impending massacre beforehand, equating this to 'protecting the lives of Korean civilians'. Such a brutal plan and despicable hypocrisy are beyond imagination. After an announcement like this from General Barcus (Commander of the US Fifth Air Force), who can still believe that the United States is only bombing military targets as they claim? Their intention is to kill by destruction, to intimidate by destruction. Their intention is to prolong the Korean War (if they really wanted to reach a truce agreement in Panmunjom, would they adopt this attitude? Would they adopt such a plan?), and eventually expand the war to the whole of Asia."

    The British "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 6th saying: "The US High Command used to claim that air raids on North Korea were not to massacre peaceful residents, but had other purposes as an excuse. Now, this threatening action completely overturns their own excuses." The editorial pointed out:

    "The real intention of the Americans is to prolong the war." The editorial concluded:

    "There is only one way to end this endless slaughter: force the Americans to abide by the principles of the Geneva Convention and repatriate all prisoners of war."

    The American "Daily Worker" condemned the US for intensifying intimidation attacks on Korea and provocative actions against China in a commentary on August 1st. It said: "This kind of American action is simply daydreaming, and it will pay a heavy price in casualties as a result." The newspaper called on the American people to firmly advocate an immediate cessation of all fighting, exchange all prisoners of war on both sides, and promptly realize a truce.

    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: TASS, London, 11th: "Reynolds News" published an editorial entitled "Horror in Korea" which said: "The Tokyo United Nations Command has openly declared that it will eliminate seventy-eight cities in northern Korea. The first few steps of this appalling action have already begun. No one believes that these cities, which are about to be destroyed on a large scale, are important military targets." The newspaper pointed out: "The new news about the massacre of residents in northern Korea will shock people all over the world. These actions taken in the name of the United Nations will arouse irresistible hatred among the people of India, Pakistan, Burma, and Indonesia." The newspaper continued: "The truce talks are at a standstill because the American representatives refuse to repatriate Chinese and Korean prisoners of war 'for humanitarian reasons'... If the threat of a torrential rain of bombs and napalm bombs is used against tens of thousands of men, women, and children, then how can the world be convinced of this 'humanitarian' treatment of prisoners of war? Public opinion should try to stop this terrible tragedy in Korea."

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th: The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 10th, denouncing the US air bandits' frenzied bombing of residential areas in the rear of Korea, as well as the shameless crimes of the US aggressors who recently openly clamored to bomb seventy-eight peaceful cities in northern Korea.

    The commentary pointed out that the US aggressors' increasingly rampant indiscriminate bombing shows that, more than a year after the truce talks have continued, the enemy has still not abandoned its sinister plan to massacre Korean people on a large scale. The US aggressors' several frenzied bombings of the Pyongyang area and its neighboring areas on July 11, August 4, and August 10 most vividly illustrate their barbarity and cruelty. All the affected areas were residential areas of peaceful residents, and the vast majority of victims were women and children.

    The commentary continued: The US Air Force conducts frequent indiscriminate bombing not only during the day but also late at night when people are already asleep. This inhuman nighttime bombing of densely populated areas of peaceful residents has killed many children and women and destroyed many cultural facilities and residences. In order to absolve themselves of the crime of this barbaric massacre of humanity, the US war peddlers have fabricated a series of lies, saying that they are taking "military pressure," supposedly to accelerate the negotiation process. However, the fact proves that the US executioners' large-scale massacre of humanity did not begin today. From the first day of the war, the US aggressors repeatedly carried out thousands of bestial indiscriminate bombings with the aim of massacring the Korean people on a large scale.

    The commentary emphasized that the reason why the US aggressors are openly using this means of mass killing threats today is to attempt to force the Korean people to accept the unreasonable demands that the US side insists on in the truce talks. If this attempt cannot be realized, it will sabotage the truce talks and further expand its war of aggression. The attitude taken by the American generals at Panmunjom for several months has clearly illustrated this intention of the US aggressors towards the Korean truce talks. The commentary pointed out that these conspiracies of the US aggressors are destined to fail as in the past. Everyone knows that the atrocities of the US aggressors have aroused the anger of all peace-loving people in the world. The new criminal plan to massacre the Korean people on a large scale will arouse even stronger hatred and condemnation from millions of honest men and women around the world. The people of all countries also condemn the US for attempting not to reach an agreement in the negotiations, attempting to sabotage the negotiations, and expanding the war.

    The commentary concluded that the Korean people sincerely strive for the early completion of the truce talks in order to satisfy the unanimous desire of peace-loving people all over the world. However, if the aggressors disregard the peace-loving aspirations of the Korean people, sabotage the negotiations, and expand the war, our people will use all their strength to smash the enemy's sinister conspiracies. The Korean people are very clear about what the tricks of the US aggressors, who are clamoring to bomb cities in northern Korea, mean. The Korean people know that the enemy wants to use this to weaken the Korean people's will to fight and force the Korean people to submit. However, no matter what conspiracies and tricks the enemy plays, the Korean people will thoroughly crush them. The Korean people must solemnly warn the US aggressors today: Only by retracting its absurd claims on the issue of prisoners of war and accepting our fair and reasonable plan, so that the truce talks can reach an agreement as soon as possible, is the only way to live up to the expectations of people all over the world. If the United States thinks that it can force the Korean people to accept their absurd claims by means of intimidation and threats, it is just a ridiculous fantasy.

    各国报纸斥美军滥炸朝鲜城镇的罪恶计划
    朝鲜中央通讯社谴责美国疯狂轰炸的暴行
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】各国进步报纸一致谴责美国空军的大规模轰炸朝鲜和平城镇的罪恶计划。
    法国“人道报”在六日评论说：“美国人毫无人性地宣布计划屠杀成千上万的平民、妇女和儿童，而他们还装腔作势说事先警告屠杀就要到来，就等于‘保护朝鲜平民的生命’，这种残暴的计划和卑劣的假惺惺的态度，真是人们再也想像不到的。在巴喀斯（美军第五航空队司令）这样宣布过之后，谁还能相信美国真像他们自己所说的那样仅仅轰炸军事目标呢？他们的意图是用毁灭的方法来屠杀，用毁灭来恐吓。他们的意图是拖延朝鲜战争（假如他们真的愿意在板门店取得停战协议，他们会采取这种态度吗？他们会采取这样的计划吗？），最后并把战争扩大到整个亚洲。”
    英国“工人日报”六日发表社论说：“美国最高统帅部以前空袭北朝鲜总是说不是为了残杀和平居民，而借口另有其他目的，现在他们这种威胁行动，就完全推翻了他们自己的借口。”社论指出：
    “美国人的真正意图是延长战争”。社论最后说：
    “要终止这永无止境的屠杀，只有一个办法，那就是强迫美国人遵守日内瓦公约的原则，并遣返全部俘虏。”
    美国“工人日报”在八月一日的评论中斥责美国加紧对朝鲜进行恐吓袭击，对中国进行挑衅的行动。它说：“美国这种行动简直就是白昼做梦，它将要因此而付出大量伤亡作代价。”该报号召美国人民坚决主张马上停止一切战斗，并交换双方全部俘虏，迅速实现停战。
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社伦敦十一日讯：“雷诺新闻”发表题为“朝鲜的恐怖”的社论说：“东京联合国军司令部公开宣称，要消灭七十八个朝鲜北部的城市。这个骇人听闻的行动的头几个步骤已经开始了。没有人会认为这些将被大规模毁灭的城市，是重要的军事目标。”该报指出：“关于屠杀朝鲜北部居民的新消息，将使全世界人们都感到惊骇。用联合国名义采取的这些行动，将引起印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸和印度尼西亚人民不可抑止的仇恨。”该报继称：“停战谈判陷于僵局，是由于美国代表在谈判中‘为了人道’而拒绝遣返中、朝战俘……如果用密雨般的炸弹和凝固汽油弹来威胁成千成万的男人、女人和儿童，那末怎么能使全世界相信这种对战俘‘人道’的说法呢？舆论界应该设法制止朝鲜的这个可怕的悲剧。”
    【新华社平壤十三日电】朝鲜中央通讯社十日发表评论，痛斥美国空中强盗对朝鲜后方居民区的疯狂轰炸以及美国侵略者最近公开叫嚣要轰炸朝鲜北部七十八个和平城市的无耻罪行。
    评论指出：美国侵略者变本加厉的狂轰滥炸，说明在停战谈判持续了一年多以后的今天，敌人仍旧没有放弃其大量屠杀朝鲜人民的罪恶计划。美国侵略者在七月十一日、八月四日和八月十日几次对平壤地区及其邻近地区的狂轰滥炸，最鲜明地说明了他们的野蛮和残暴。被害的全部地区都是和平居民的住宅区，牺牲者绝大多数是妇女和儿童。
    评论接着说：美国空军不仅在白天，而且还在人们都已入睡的深夜进行频繁的盲目轰炸。这种对和平居民密集地区的灭绝人性的夜间轰炸，杀害了许多儿童和妇女，破坏了许多文化设施和住宅。美国战争贩子们为了替他们这种野蛮的屠杀人类的暴行开脱罪责，便制造了一大套谎言，说他们这样是采取“军事压力”据说是要加速谈判的进行。但是，事实证明美国刽子手对人类的大量屠杀，绝不是从今天开始的。美国侵略者从发动战争的头一天起，就以大量屠杀朝鲜人民为目的，反复进行了数千次野兽般的狂轰滥炸。
    评论着重指出：美国侵略者所以在今天又公开使用这种大量屠杀的威胁手段，是妄图借此迫使朝鲜人民接受美方在停战谈判中所固执的无理主张。如果这种企图不能实现，它就破坏停战谈判，进而扩大其侵略战争。几个月来美国将军们在板门店所采取的态度，已经清楚地说明了美国侵略者对朝鲜停战谈判的这种意图。评论指出：美国侵略者的这些阴谋正像过去一样是一定要失败的。大家都很清楚，美国侵略者的暴行已经引起了全世界一切爱好和平的人民的愤怒。大批屠杀朝鲜人民的新的犯罪计划，更将引起全世界千千万万正直男女更强烈的憎恨和谴责。世界各国人民同时也谴责美国企图不在谈判中达成协议、企图破坏谈判和扩大战争的行为。
    评论最后说：朝鲜人民真诚地力求停战谈判早日完成，以便满足全世界爱好和平人民的一致愿望。但是，如果侵略者不顾朝鲜人民爱好和平的愿望，破坏谈判并扩大战争，我国人民将用一切的力量来粉碎敌人的罪恶阴谋。朝鲜人民非常清楚地知道美国侵略者所正在叫嚣的轰炸朝鲜北部城市的诡计意味着什么。朝鲜人民知道敌人想借此削弱朝鲜人民的斗争意志，迫使朝鲜人民屈服。但是，不管敌人玩弄任何阴谋诡计，朝鲜人民都将予以彻底粉碎。朝鲜人民今天要严正警告美国侵略者：只有收回其对战俘问题的荒谬主张，接受我方公平合理的方案，使停战谈判早日获得协议，才是不辜负全世界人民的期待的唯一道路。如果美国以为用恐吓威胁的手段就可以迫使朝鲜人民接受他们的荒谬主张的话，那只是可笑的幻想而已。
