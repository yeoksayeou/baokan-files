    Building Farms in the Borderlands of the Motherland
    Editor: We were assigned by the higher authorities to open farms in minority areas. We started from Kangding City in Xikang, advanced towards the Zheduo Mountain, which is 4,700 meters above sea level, and embarked on the battle post of agricultural production in the motherland.
    On June 1st, we began to cultivate this vast grassland that no one had cared about for thousands of years. Countless stones were buried under the grassland, the large ones weighing four or five hundred catties, and the small ones weighing two or three hundred catties. No matter how heavy or large the stones were, we dug them out and moved them away. The climate on the plateau is hot and cold, but neither cold nor heat can stop our enthusiasm for reclaiming wasteland. We launched competitions between classes and individuals. In less than two months, we opened up more than 200 mu of virgin land.
    When the minority people saw this scene, they raised their thumbs and expressed their infinite admiration, saying "Yam! Yam!" (Very good!) The people in this area used to live by nomadic life, but now they are learning from our example, reclaiming wasteland, and starting to engage in agricultural production.
    We are soldiers of Mao Zedong. No matter on which construction front of the motherland, we must overcome difficulties and complete our tasks. We are now working hard to achieve the goal of reclaiming 800 mu. We guarantee to implement the minority policies and strive to build the borderlands of the motherland.

    在祖国边疆建设农场
    编辑同志：我们是由上级分配到少数民族地区开办农场的。我们从西康康定城出发，向着拔海四千七百公尺的折多山挺进，踏上了祖国农业生产的战斗岗位。
    六月一日，我们开始在这几千年来无人过问的大草原上开垦起来了。草原下面埋藏着无数石头，大的四、五百斤重，小的也有二、三百斤重。石头不管有多重多大，都被我们掘出搬掉了，高原的气候忽冷忽热，但冷热都挡不住我们开荒的热情。我们班与班、个人与个人之间展开了竞赛。在不到两月的时间里，开出了二百多亩处女地。
    少数民族人民看到这番情景，双手翘起大拇指，表示无限钦佩的样子说：“牙姆！牙姆！”（很好）这地区人民原以游牧为生，如今学着我们的榜样，也开起荒来，开始从事农业生产。
    我们是毛泽东的战士，无论在祖国那一个建设战线上，都要克服困难，完成任务。我们现在正为开荒八百亩的目标而努力。我们保证贯彻执行少数民族政策，为建设祖国的边疆而奋斗。
