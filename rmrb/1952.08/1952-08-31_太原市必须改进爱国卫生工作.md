    Taiyuan City Must Improve Patriotic Health Work

    To the Editor: We are students from Beijing interning in Taiyuan. We have found that Taiyuan's sanitation work is very inadequate. There are often piles of garbage, children's excrement, and mule and horse manure on the sides of the streets; restaurants and toilets are simply worlds of flies. Four of us students, in a restaurant on a street that had been awarded the title of "Sanitation Model," swatted 240 flies during one meal. We heard that there are even more flies on other streets.

    Four of our classmates developed gastrointestinal illnesses after arriving in Taiyuan, one of whom was so seriously ill that he had to be hospitalized. This is certainly related to the large number of flies in Taiyuan. When we eat in small restaurants and factory canteens, we often find cooked flies in the food. In a primary school where we were staying, we caught more than 1,400 surprisingly large bedbugs on the bed boards in our dormitory.

    Taiyuan has also carried out sanitation propaganda work, but it has not been done thoroughly enough. The patriotic covenants in every restaurant include the item "Pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene," but many restaurants do not swat flies. A resident of Heitu Lane told us that they usually never hear about cleanliness and hygiene propaganda, and they never know about the call to eliminate flies and mosquitoes, but one day the neighborhood group leader suddenly came to count the number of flies swatted by each household, so they casually reported numbers like two hundred or three hundred. No wonder they are surprised to see us students swatting flies.

    Taiyuan is an industrial city, and it is very wrong for sanitation work to be so poor. We hope that the local leading organs will pay serious attention to this.

### 太原市必须改进爱国卫生工作

    太原市必须改进爱国卫生工作
    编辑同志：我们是从北京来太原实习的学生。我们发觉太原市的卫生工作，做得非常不够，街道旁常常有垃圾堆、小孩的便溺和骡马的粪便；饭馆和厕所简直是苍蝇的世界。我们四个同学在一条获得“卫生模范”称号的街道的一家饭店里，一顿饭的时间打了二百四十个苍蝇。听说别的街道苍蝇就更多了。
    我们有四个同学到太原之后生了肠胃病，其中一个严重得必须住医院，这和太原的苍蝇多不是没关系的。我们在小饭馆、工厂的食堂吃饭，常常发见饭菜里有煮熟了的苍蝇；在寄住的一所小学里，我们在宿舍的床板上竟捉到了一千四百多只肥大得惊人的臭虫。
    太原市也进行过卫生宣传工作，但做得极不深入，每家饭馆的爱国公约上都有“注重清洁卫生”一条，但许多饭馆都不打苍蝇。一个黑土巷的居民告诉我们说，他们平常从来没有听见过清洁卫生的宣传，也从来不知有灭蝇灭蚊的号召，但是有一天居民小组长忽然来统计每家打苍蝇的数字，于是他们就随便报上二百、三百的数字。无怪他们看见我们同学打苍蝇就感到诧异。
    太原是一个工业城市，卫生工作做得这样糟糕，是非常不对的，希望当地领导机关切实注意起来。
