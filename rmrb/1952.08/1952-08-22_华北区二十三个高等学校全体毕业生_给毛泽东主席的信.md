All Graduates of Twenty-Three Universities and Colleges in North China
A Letter to Chairman Mao Zedong

Respected Chairman Mao: We, all the graduating students from twenty-three universities and colleges in North China, have completed our studies and are about to go to various work posts where the motherland needs us most. Now we are pleased to report to you: We are all prepared!

As we graduate, it is just the time when the motherland's financial and economic situation has fundamentally improved and is about to begin large-scale economic construction. This is the beginning of a new historical period for the motherland. We feel infinitely honored and excited to be able to personally participate in the unveiling of this great historical period. For the prosperity and strength of the motherland, for lasting world peace, and for the beautiful communist future of the motherland, each of us students is ready to immediately plunge into the actual struggle with an excited heart.

In the past three years, under your leadership, we have learned the correct outlook on life education and recognized the direction of our future efforts. We will keep in mind your earnest teachings of "integrating with the workers and peasants" and "serving the people wholeheartedly," and we must implement them in our actual actions.

We are not unaware of the arduousness of the motherland's construction cause, and we are not unaware that there will be many difficulties on the road ahead. However, with your leadership and together with the people of the whole country, what difficulties can we not overcome? We must regard mountains as small mounds and the sea as small ditches, and take on the tasks entrusted to us by the motherland.

Dear Chairman Mao! We will not only obey the motherland's assignment 100%, but also guarantee that we will not shrink back or waver in the face of any difficulties. We must work hard to study, constantly improve our political level, master our professions, and always be loyal to the people's cause, and always strive to build a great motherland. We wish you eternal health.
