Every Household Stresses Hygiene, Everyone Loves Cleanliness - Patriotic Health Campaign in Longxugou

    All Beijing citizens know that Longxugou, close to the Temple of Heaven, used to be a stinking ditch, and near the ditch was a stinking pond - Jin Yu Chi (Goldfish Pond). Every summer, it was full of piles of maggots and swarms of flies and mosquitoes, a great scourge for the nearby residents. In 1950, the Municipal People's Government turned the original stinking ditch into a covered drain and built a flat road. In 1951, Jin Yu Chi was renovated into a scenic area for people to visit. The sanitary environment of the nearby residents has been fundamentally changed. Especially in this year's patriotic health campaign, the residents here have actively participated in cleaning the streets, catching rats, flies, and mosquitoes... Moreover, they have developed good habits of paying attention to cleanliness and hygiene. This is one of the typical examples of the patriotic health campaign in Beijing.

    In Jin Yu Chi near Longxugou, which used to be a stinking pond, it has now become a very clean place.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Government sent an epidemic prevention team to help residents in the Longxugou area spray "666" insecticide.

    Residents near Longxugou hold a meeting to promote and mobilize the patriotic health campaign.

    Residents of Longxugou often clean the newly built streets.

    In the pickle jars of Tongyihou Oil and Salt Store near Longxugou, not a single worm can be found.

    Residents in the Longxugou area have generally launched rat-catching activities.

    Members of the 13th Branch of the Patriotic Health Committee are seriously inspecting the sanitary work of residents.

    Residents often clean up their houses and courtyards.

    Even one fly must be eliminated!

    "Without mosquitoes and flies, the children can sleep well."

    家家讲卫生人人爱清洁  爱国卫生运动在龙须沟
    北京市民都知道紧靠天坛的龙须沟，在以前是一个臭水沟，靠近沟沿是一个臭水坑——金鱼池。每年夏季，这里到处是成堆的蛆虫和成群的苍蝇、蚊子。成了附近居民的大祸害。市人民政府于一九五○年把原来的臭沟改成暗沟，修成一条平坦的马路；一九五一年又把金鱼池修成了供人游玩的风景区。使附近居民的卫生环境有了根本的改变。特别是在今年爱国卫生运动中，这里的居民都积极地参加打扫街道，捕捉老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子……。而且，他们都养成讲究清洁卫生的好习惯。这是爱国卫生运动在北京的典型事例之一。
