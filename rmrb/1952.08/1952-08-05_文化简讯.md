    Introduction to the Contents of "Study" Magazine, 1952, Issue No. 5
    The fifth issue of "Study" magazine for 1952 was published on August 1st. The main contents of this issue include "Our Self-Criticism" by Hu Sheng, Yu Guangyuan, and others, which made a serious self-criticism of the dogmatism and Party jargon in the articles written by comrades participating in the editorial work of "Study" magazine in the past, as well as the errors in several articles on the bourgeoisie published in the first, second, and third issues of the magazine in 1952.
    The "Study Commentary" column in this issue published an article entitled "We Must Pay Attention to and Study Economic Work," pointing out that comrades in any work position must pay attention to and study economic work to varying degrees. In order to help readers study "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction," the magazine has opened a special column from this issue to introduce and explain the more important issues and papers in this book. Published in this issue is Fang Yuan's "Lenin on Labor Emulation."
    The issue includes essays such as Zhao Yimin's "Leading Cadres Must Take the Lead in Studying Theory," Xu Bangyi's "Studying Comrade Mao Zedong's 'Foreword to "The Communist'"'," and Wang Langchao's "Why the Chinese Communist Party is the Product of the Combination of the Workers' Movement and Marxism-Leninism," The latter two articles can be used for study reference in Party rectification and Party building.
    From this issue, the magazine has opened a new "Document Study" column, publishing three important documents such as "Comrade Chen Yun's Speech at the Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce," as well as study outlines, materials, and annotations to help study these three documents.
    From this issue, the magazine has restored the "Questions and Answers" column.
    In addition, this issue also publishes a summary of readers' letters, summarizing readers' criticisms of the magazine's mistakes on the issue of the bourgeoisie.
