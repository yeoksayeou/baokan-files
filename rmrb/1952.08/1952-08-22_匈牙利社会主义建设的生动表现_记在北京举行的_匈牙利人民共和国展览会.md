    A Vivid Expression of Socialist Construction in Hungary
    ——On the "Exhibition of the Hungarian People's Republic" held in Beijing
    By our reporter Cheng Guangrui
    The "Exhibition of the Hungarian People's Republic" opened on August 20th at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. This is a significant event in the development of friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples. The "Exhibition of the Hungarian People's Republic" demonstrates the great achievements Hungary has made in the political, economic, and cultural fields in the seven years since its liberation, especially the economic achievements made in the first five-year plan for socialist construction. Hungary's socialist industrialization is the main content of this exhibition.
    The exhibition is set up in the main hall of the Working People's Cultural Palace, which has been completely renovated. The exhibits not only fill the 2,000-square-meter hall but also the 5,000-square-meter courtyard in front of the hall. The exhibition first shows us the scene of the development of Hungary's heavy industry. On display in the hall are flexible drilling machines with a maximum drill speed of 1,900 revolutions per minute; large lathes capable of manufacturing various machine parts; and the latest-style planers. The exhibition also displays exquisite locomotive models, motorized bicycles, X-ray machines, and other instruments. On display in the courtyard are various machines such as huge buses, diesel trucks, tractors, seed selectors, threshers, conveyors, and crushers. The development of Hungary's machinery industry provides decisive conditions for Hungary's socialist industrialization and agricultural mechanization. The exhibition also shows us the face of the development of Hungary's light industry. On display here are various rubber and glass industrial products, various medicines and pharmaceutical raw materials, photographic equipment, radios, sewing machines, toiletries, cosmetics, stationery, leather shoes, porcelain, and woodenware, as well as various brightly colored textiles.
    Hungary's ability to achieve today's achievements is inseparable from the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the hard work of the Hungarian people, and the assistance of the Soviet Union. A series of photos in the exhibition illustrate this point. The great Soviet army liberated Hungary from the enslavement of German fascism, destroyed the regime of feudal landlords and big capitalists, and opened up a broad road of democratic development for the Hungarian people. In the early days of liberation, poor farmers were given land. The photos show the joy of the farmers after obtaining land. After liberation, the Soviet Union transported a large amount of grain, and Comrade Rákosi announced the implementation of currency reform, rescuing the Hungarian people from hunger and hardship. We can see from the photos that the Soviet army and the Hungarian people rebuilt new houses on the ruins together. In 1950, according to the provisions of the first five-year plan, the Hungarian people began socialist construction. The construction of the new socialist industrial city of Stalin City on the banks of the Danube is the greatest project of the five-year plan. A series of photos show that the Hungarian people used the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and Soviet machines, and with the direct help of Soviet advanced producers, carried out the construction of huge projects such as the steel plant in Stalin City. They built the Budapest subway based on the experience of the Soviet people in building the Moscow subway. Many photos show the achievements of Hungarian agriculture. Hungary's mechanical industry produces a large number of tractors and combine harvesters to meet the needs of agriculture.
    The achievements of Hungary's five-year plan for economic construction have brought a happy life to the Hungarian people and greatly helped Hungary's cultural construction. Some photos show that workers and farmers have obtained the opportunity to learn culture, and libraries have also been set up in rural areas. Sports have become a mass activity in Hungary. The development of Hungarian sports has enabled it to achieve remarkable achievements at the International Olympic Games held not long ago in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. The exhibition displays various books published in Hungary. We can also see in the exhibition a quaint room of a Hungarian Kolocha village. This village is the most famous homeland of Hungarian folk art.
    A series of photos in the exhibition also shows the Hungarian people's will to defend peace and their spirit of internationalism: the Hungarian People's Army, equipped with modern equipment, is being inspected, which is an important force for defending the Hungarian people's peaceful construction and guarding world peace; the Hungarian people enthusiastically participate in various peace rallies; the World Youth and Student Peace Festival held in Budapest vividly demonstrates the firm will of the Hungarian people to unite with the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and peace-loving people from all over the world to defend peace; the two hundred Korean children in the Kim Il-sung School in Budapest participated in a grand demonstration against germ warfare; the Hungarian people transported trains of medicines and other supplies to the Korean front to support the Korean people resisting American aggressors...
    The exhibition also demonstrates the close friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples and the Hungarian people's love for New China. In a delicately arranged small study in the exhibition, there are displayed Chairman Mao's works and literary works of New China published in Hungarian: Xiao San's biography of Chairman Mao and novels by Ding Ling, Zhou Libo, Zhao Shuli, and Cao Ming.
    The "Exhibition of the Hungarian People's Republic" is held in accordance with the Sino-Hungarian Cultural Agreement. This exhibition will continue to be held in Shanghai and other major cities in our country.

    匈牙利社会主义建设的生动表现
    ——记在北京举行的“匈牙利人民共和国展览会”
    本报记者　程光锐
    “匈牙利人民共和国展览会”已于八月二十日在北京劳动人民文化宫揭幕。这是中匈两国人民友谊发展途程中的一件大事情。“匈牙利人民共和国展览会”表现了匈牙利解放七年来在政治、经济和文化方面的巨大成就，特别是在实行建设社会主义的第一个五年计划中经济建设的成就。匈牙利的社会主义工业化就是这个展览会的主要内容。
    展览会设在劳动人民文化宫的大殿里，这座宫殿已被布置得焕然一新了。展览品不仅摆满了这个面积达二千平方公尺的大殿，而且也摆满了大殿前面的面积达五千平方公尺的庭院。展览会首先使我们看到了匈牙利重工业发展的景象。陈列在大殿里的，有操作灵活的钻床，钻头最快的旋转率达到一分钟一千九百次；有可以制造各种机器零件的大镟床和最新式的刨床。展览会上还陈列了精美的机车模型、机器脚踏车、爱克斯光机和其他器械等。陈列在庭院中的，有巨大的公共汽车、柴油卡车、拖拉机、选种机、打谷机、输送机和压碎机等各种机械。匈牙利机械工业的发展，为匈牙利的社会主义工业化和农业机械化提供了决定性的条件。展览会也使我们看到了匈牙利轻工业发展的面貌。这里陈列着各种橡胶工业和玻璃工业的制成品、各种药品和制药原料、照像器材、收音机、缝纫机、盥洗用器、化妆品、文具、皮鞋、瓷器和木器以及各种颜色鲜艳的纺织品。
    匈牙利能获得今天的成就，是与劳动人民党的领导、匈牙利人民的辛勤劳动和苏联的援助分不开的。展览会上的一组照片说明了这一点。伟大的苏联军队从德国法西斯的奴役下解放了匈牙利，摧毁了封建地主和大资本家的政权，为匈牙利人民开辟了一条民主发展的广阔道路。在解放初期贫苦的农民们就分得了土地。照片上显示了农民们获得土地后的喜悦。解放后，苏联运来了大批的粮食，拉科西同志宣布实行币制改革，把匈牙利人民从饥饿、困苦的生活中解救出来。我们可以从照片上看到：苏联军队和匈牙利人民一起，在废墟上重建起新的房屋。一九五○年，匈牙利人民依照第一个五年计划的规定，开始进行社会主义建设。多瑙河岸上新的社会主义工业城市斯大林城的建设是五年计划中最伟大的工程。一组照片显示：匈牙利人民运用苏联的先进经验和苏联的机器，并在苏联先进生产者的直接帮助下，进行斯大林城的冶炼厂等巨大工程的建设。他们根据苏联人民建设莫斯科地下铁道的经验，来建设布达佩斯的地下铁道。许多照片显示了匈牙利农业的成就。匈牙利的机械工业生产出大量的拖拉机和联合收割机供给农业上的需要。
    匈牙利五年计划经济建设的成就，给匈牙利人民带来了幸福的生活，并大大帮助了匈牙利的文化建设。一些照片显示工人和农民获得了学习文化的机会，农村里也设立了图书馆。体育在匈牙利已经成了群众性的活动。匈牙利人民体育的发展，已使它在不久以前于芬兰首都赫尔辛基举行的国际奥林匹克运动大会上获得了卓越的成就。展览会上陈列了匈牙利出版的各种书籍。我们还可以在展览会中看到一个布置得古色古香的匈牙利科罗恰村庄的一个房间。这个村庄是最有名的匈牙利民间艺术的乡土。
    展览会里的一组照片也显示了匈牙利人民保卫和平的意志和国际主义精神：有着现代化装备的匈牙利人民军正受着检阅，这是保卫匈牙利人民进行和平建设与警卫世界和平的一支重要的力量；匈牙利人民热烈参加各种和平集会；在布达佩斯举行的世界青年与学生和平联欢节，生动地表现了匈牙利人民与苏联人民、中国人民和世界各国爱好和平人民团结一致保卫和平的坚强意志；布达佩斯金日成学校中的二百名朝鲜儿童参加反对细菌战的盛大示威游行；匈牙利人民把一列列火车的医药用品等运送到朝鲜前线去，支援反抗美国侵略者的朝鲜人民……
    展览会更表现了中匈两国人民的亲密友谊和匈牙利人民对新中国的热爱。在展览会里的一个布置精巧的小书房中，陈列了用匈牙利文出版的毛主席的著作和新中国的文学作品：萧三的关于毛主席传记的著作和丁玲、周立波、赵树理、草明等的小说。
    “匈牙利人民共和国展览会”是根据中匈文化协定举办的。这个展览会将继续到上海等我国各主要城市去举行。
