    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, people's judicial organs at all levels, especially the various people's tribunals, have generally played an active role in various social reform movements, particularly in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. Many people's courts, in their work, have closely integrated with mass movements, accumulated a lot of experience, trained a group of cadres, and made some new creations in the construction of people's judiciary. These achievements should be affirmed. However, in the "Three-Anti" movement, the serious phenomena of impurity in organization and thought within our people's judicial organs were also fully exposed. Many people's courts took over the mess left by the reactionary old courts of the Kuomintang, and have not yet seriously rectified and transformed themselves. Some are basically old courts that have remained untouched, while others have only undergone some improvements without thorough transformation. The leading force is very weak, and the real power of serious trial work is mostly in the hands of old judicial personnel who have not undergone ideological transformation, and in some cases, even usurped by active counter-revolutionaries who have sneaked in. Although the organization of many people's courts is relatively pure, there are also some cadres within them who are not firm in their will and have been captured by the old legal viewpoints and old judicial practices. As a result, illegal and undisciplined phenomena among the staff of people's courts at all levels, especially those acting according to old legal viewpoints and old judicial practices, are quite common and serious. This undesirable phenomenon has serious harm to the people's judicial work and national construction, which is absolutely intolerable. Therefore, on the basis of the victory of the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, launching a judicial reform movement to further strengthen the construction of the people's judiciary is both necessary and timely.
    The judicial reform movement is a movement against old legal viewpoints and for the reform of the entire judicial organ. The purpose of this movement is to thoroughly transform and rectify people's judicial organs at all levels, to purify them politically, organizationally, and ideologically, and to enable the people's judicial system to be systematically, correctly, and gradually established and improved throughout the country, so as to fully meet the needs of national construction. Through this movement, the work of the entire political and legal departments will be further improved, and the ideological and professional leadership of the political and legal work will be strengthened; and thereby the influence of old legal viewpoints in the political and legal education work will be eliminated, and the curricula of political and legal courses in various universities will be thoroughly reformed, so that it can adapt to the urgent need to cultivate a large number of political and legal work cadres in the future. This judicial reform movement is an important task to continue to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and ensure the ever-growing national construction; this is a fierce political struggle and ideological struggle in the process of people's judicial construction. It is wrong to take a cold and contemptuous attitude towards this movement.
    To correctly carry out the judicial reform movement, we must implement the principle of combining ideological transformation with organizational rectification. It is obviously wrong to unilaterally emphasize ideological education while neglecting organizational rectification, failing to remove those elements who are illegal, undisciplined, and have deep-seated bad habits that are beyond reform, and neglecting the due purity of the people's judicial organs; conversely, it is also obviously wrong to unilaterally emphasize organizational rectification without recognizing that ideological transformation is the basic content of judicial reform, and regarding judicial reform only as the internal personnel adjustment of the judicial organs. The goal of ideological transformation in the judicial departments is to eliminate the old legal viewpoints, because the old legal viewpoints are the reactionary legal viewpoints of the Kuomintang, which are reactionary dogmatism based on an anti-people stance. Only by deeply carrying out the ideological struggle against the old legal viewpoints can we guarantee the thorough victory of our judicial reform movement. And as long as ideological transformation is done well, organizational rectification will be easy to do well. We hope that the leading cadres and staff of people's judicial organs and political and legal education organs at all levels should have a full understanding of the importance of this ideological transformation.
    Of course, this struggle to reform judicial work and transform the thinking of judicial personnel, since it is to purify the organization and work style of the People's Court, so as to thoroughly transform and rectify people's courts at all levels, is not only limited to the scope of the old judicial personnel. Therefore, regardless of new or old cadres in the court, they should be inspected and accept the criticism of the masses, and those who have degenerated, deteriorated, and insisted on old legal viewpoints and refused to correct them, should be seriously and promptly dealt with. All people's judicial organs and political and legal education organs, the old cadres who retain the old legal viewpoints, especially the leading personnel among them, should first take the lead, actively and proactively carry out criticism and self-criticism, and expose the harm of the old legal viewpoints, so as to influence and drive other personnel and promote the development of this struggle. At the same time, we must point out that although the judicial reform movement is mainly to rectify and transform people's judicial organs at all levels, this movement is not unrelated to the cadres and staff of other departments of the state power work. On the contrary, their relationship is very close. Because the basic content of this movement is the struggle against the old legal viewpoints, and the old legal viewpoints come from all the reactionary state views, legal views of the old ruling class, and all the laws, decrees, and judicial system of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppressed the people. It not only invades the people's judicial organs, but also affects those with weak revolutionary will in other departments of state power work. Therefore, the struggle against the old legal viewpoints should not only be the task of the judicial organs, but should be the common task of all departments of state power work and the people.
    In order to basically complete the reform of the People's Court, it is necessary to carry out a fierce reform movement. But at the same time, we must also estimate that eliminating the old legal thinking is not a problem that can be completely solved by one movement. Therefore, we must treat this movement with a firm attitude, and we must carry out the ideological criticism of the old legal viewpoints fiercely, deeply, but also meticulously, and thoroughly expose the anti-people essence of the old legal viewpoints. In the criticism, although the general bureaucratic work style should also be criticized, do not confuse it with the reactionary old judicial viewpoints and old judicial practices, so as to hit the key, improve cadres, educate the masses, and lay a good foundation for further construction of people's judicial work in the future.
    In order to ensure the victory of the judicial reform movement, the party and government organs in various places must strengthen the leadership of the judicial departments, and first of all, strengthen the leadership of the party and government organs over the judicial reform movement. It is necessary to mobilize the masses in a planned and appropriate manner, and to adopt a combination of top-down inspection and bottom-up exposure in the judicial system, to improve the understanding of cadres and the masses, so that the old legal viewpoints and old judicial practices can no longer have their market. In the movement, in addition to those who have serious crimes and must be given the punishment they deserve according to the law, we should treat those who have no crimes or minor crimes with the attitude of treating illnesses and saving people, and welcome transformation. We know that the influence of the old legal viewpoints is widespread among the old judicial personnel, and many old cadres have also been eroded by this kind of thinking. Therefore, those who have no crimes and only retain the old legal viewpoints should be given education and transformation, and must be transformed. Therefore, in the process of carrying out this movement, we must grasp the typical examples to promote the overall situation, carry out the movement in a step-by-step and focused manner, and at the same time, carry out systematic education on the Marxist-Leninist state view and legal view, summarize the existing experience of the people's judicial work, especially the work of the people's tribunals, and carry out extensive publicity among the masses, so as to achieve the complete victory of the movement.

### 必须彻底改革司法工作

    必须彻底改革司法工作
    中华人民共和国成立以来，各级人民司法机关，特别是各种人民法庭，在各项社会改革运动中，特别是在“三反”和“五反”斗争中，一般地起了积极的作用；不少人民法院在工作中，密切地结合群众运动，积累了许多经验，锻炼了一批干部，并在人民司法建设上有了若干新的创造，这些成绩是应该肯定的。但在这次“三反”运动中，同时也充分暴露了我们人民司法机关本身还存在着许多组织不纯和思想不纯的严重现象。不少人民法院接管了国民党反动旧法院的烂摊子，至今还没有认真地进行整顿和改造，有的基本上仍是原封未动的旧法院，有的仅有一些改良而没有彻底改造，领导力量很薄弱，严肃的审判工作的实权大部分是操在那些未经思想改造的旧司法人员之手，甚至有的是被混入的现行反革命犯所篡夺。许多人民法院，虽然组织还比较纯洁，但其中也有一部分意志不坚定的干部，经不起旧法观点和旧司法作风的侵袭而做了俘虏。这样，各级人民法院工作人员间的违法乱纪现象，特别是那种按旧法观点和旧司法作风办事的现象，就相当普遍而严重。这种不良现象对于人民司法工作和国家建设事业具有严重的危害性，是绝对不能容忍的。因此，在伟大的“三反”和“五反”运动胜利的基础上，开展一个司法改革运动，以便进一步加强人民司法的建设工作，是十分必要的和适时的。
    司法改革运动是反对旧法观点和改革整个司法机关的运动。这个运动的目的是要求彻底改造和整顿各级人民司法机关，使它从政治上、组织上和思想作风上纯洁起来，使人民司法制度在全国范围内能够有系统地正确地逐步建立和健全起来，以便完全符合于国家建设的需要。经过这个运动，要进一步改善整个政法部门的工作，加强政法工作的思想和业务的领导；并由此肃清旧法观点在政法教育工作中的影响，彻底进行各大学政法课程的改革，使它能够适应于今后培养大批政法工作干部的迫切需要。这个司法改革运动是继续巩固人民民主专政、保障日益增长的国家建设的一项重要工作；这是人民司法建设过程中的一场激烈的政治斗争和思想斗争。对于这个运动抱冷淡的轻视的态度是错误的。
    我们要正确地开展司法改革运动，必须贯彻思想改造与组织整顿相结合的方针。片面地强调思想教育而忽视组织整顿，对于那些违法乱纪和恶习甚深不堪改造的分子不加清除，忽视人民司法机关应有的纯洁性，显然是不对的；反之，片面强调组织整顿而不认识思想改造是司法改革的基本内容，把司法改革只看做是司法机关内部的人事调整，显然也是不对的。司法部门的思想改造的目标就是要肃清旧法观点，因为旧法观点是国民党反动的法律观点，它是由反人民的立场出发的反动的教条主义。只有深入地开展反旧法观点的思想斗争，才能保证我们的司法改革运动走向彻底的胜利。而只要思想改造做得好，组织整顿也就容易做好。我们希望各级人民司法机关和政法教育机关的领导干部和工作人员，对于这个思想改造的重要性都应该有充分的认识。
    当然，改革司法工作和改造司法人员思想的这个斗争，既然是为了纯洁人民法院的组织和思想作风，以便彻底改造和整顿各级人民法院，就不只是限于旧司法人员的范围。因此，不论法院中的新、老干部人员，都应该进行检查并接受群众的批评，如有堕落蜕化和坚持旧法观点不肯改正的，都应该严肃地及时地加以处理。一切人民司法机关和政法教育机关中，保有旧法观点的老干部，特别是其中的领导人员，首先应该以身作则，积极地、主动地进行批评与自我批评，揭发旧法观点的危害性，以影响和带动其他人员，推动这一斗争的开展。同时，我们必须指出，司法改革运动虽然是以整顿和改造各级人民司法机关为主，但这个运动并不是与国家政权工作的其他部门干部和工作人员没有关系的，恰恰相反，他们的关系是十分密切的。因为这个运动的基本内容是反对旧法观点的斗争，而旧法观点是来自旧统治阶级的一切反动的国家观、法律观以及国民党反动政府的一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度，它不仅侵袭人民司法机关，而且同样会影响到国家政权工作的其他部门中那些革命意志薄弱的人。因此反对旧法观点的斗争，不应该只是司法机关的任务，而应该是国家政权工作的各部门和人民群众的共同任务。
    为了在基本上完成人民法院的改革工作，进行一次激烈的改革运动是必要的。但同时我们还必须估计到肃清旧法律思想，则不是一次运动所能够彻底解决的。因此，我们就必须以坚决的态度来对待这个运动，必须猛烈地深入地但又细致地进行对于旧法观点的思想批判工作，彻底揭发旧法观点的反人民的本质。在批判中，对于一般的工作作风上的官僚主义虽然也应该加以批判，但不要把这和反动的旧司法观点与旧司法作风混为一谈，以便击中要害，提高干部，教育群众，给今后进一步建设人民司法工作打下良好的基础。
    为了保证司法改革运动的胜利，各地党政机关必须加强对司法部门的领导，首先要加强党政机关对司法改革运动的领导。必须有计划地适当地发动群众，并在司法系统中采取自上而下的检查和自下而上的揭发相结合，提高干部和群众的认识，使旧法观点和旧司法作风不能再有它的市场。在运动中，除了对于罪恶严重，必须依法给以应得的处分者外，对于没有罪恶或罪恶轻微的人，我们应以治病救人、欢迎改造的态度来进行这个思想斗争。我们知道，旧法观点的影响虽在旧司法人员间是普遍的，并且有不少老干部也受了这种思想的侵蚀，因此，对于没有罪恶仅仅保有旧法观点的人是应该给以教育改造的，而且是必须改造的。所以在开展这个运动的过程中，必须抓住典型推动全盘，有步骤、有重点地进行，同时还应进行系统的马克思列宁主义的国家观和法律观的教育，总结人民司法工作特别是人民法庭工作已有的经验，在群众中进行广泛的宣传，以达到运动的彻底胜利。
