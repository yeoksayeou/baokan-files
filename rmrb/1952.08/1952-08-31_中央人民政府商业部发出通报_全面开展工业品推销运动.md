Xinhua News Agency, August 30th:

    The autumn harvest crops have begun to enter the market in various parts of the country. Supplying a large quantity of industrial products to farmers and replenishing the state's purchasing funds to meet farmers' demands for selling agricultural products has become an urgent task for state-owned trade departments. Therefore, the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government recently issued a circular instructing state-owned trade departments in various regions to further and fully launch industrial product promotion campaigns.

    The national state-owned trade system's industrial product promotion competition has recently been launched in major administrative regions, municipalities under the jurisdiction of major administrative regions, and some provincial-level units. However, most provincial and some special district and county-level state-owned trade units were still in the preparation stage in early August; individual provinces had not yet paid attention to this work. In the units where the campaign has been launched, most have gone through the preparation stages of mobilization, warehouse inventory, commodity categorization, and price adjustments, as well as the action stage of finding customers, and are currently developing in depth. Among the major administrative regions, the campaign in the state-owned trade system in the Southwest region has been launched faster; the industrial product promotion campaign in the Southwest region had already been launched in the state-owned trade systems at the special district level and in some counties in early August.

    In the units where the industrial product promotion campaign has been launched in the state-owned trade systems across the country, the vast majority of employees have taken active action, thus renewing the business atmosphere. The rationalization proposals put forward by employees of state-owned trade departments during the campaign in July were numerous and of high quality. In the East China region, there were 2,817 proposals, of which 1,377 were adopted; in the Northwest region, there were 629 proposals, of which 238 were adopted; in Tianjin, there were 1,353 proposals, of which 489 were adopted. The adoption of many suggestions has greatly improved business operations, increased work efficiency, and created huge wealth for the country. For example, employees of the East China Industrial Equipment Company learned from the advanced Soviet experience to improve the method of loading trucks, increasing the number of trucks loaded per flatbed car from one to eight trucks per three flatbed cars, thus saving more than 1 billion yuan in transportation costs in July. The No. 4 Warehouse of the East China Department Store improved the packaging method for cotton fabrics. After adopting this method, it is estimated that packaging and transportation costs for the purchase of undershirts alone can be saved by 5 billion yuan in the second half of the year. The state-owned trade department in Tianjin saved 6.6 billion yuan in commodity operating expenses by adopting 489 rationalization proposals from employees.

    Many state-owned trade units have relied on cooperatives and united private merchants in the promotion campaign, implementing the business policy of focusing on wholesale. For example, the Hebei Provincial Department Store established contacts with 1,205 cooperatives throughout the province during the campaign. The Yangliuqing Department Store in Tianjin Prefecture, thanks to the strong support of cooperatives, sold goods worth 68 percent of its total sales in July to cooperatives, and completed the monthly sales plan in 22 days. The East China Petroleum Company held symposiums of representatives of public and private enterprises twice, truthfully promoting the advantages of domestic and imported oil products from the Soviet Union and Eastern European New Democratic countries, thus changing the oil users' long-standing habit of using British and American oil products. Furthermore, units such as the Shanghai Industrial Equipment Company and the Jiaozuo Department Store in Pingyuan Province have held symposiums with private manufacturers, enabling private merchants and state-owned companies to establish normal business relationships.

    In addition, state-owned trade units in some areas have cooperated with the primary market materials exchange fairs in the campaign, selling a large number of industrial products.

    The industrial product promotion campaign has achieved great results after its launch. For example, in July, the national state-owned trade system's domestic sales and cash recovery increased by 26.9 percent compared with June, and by 75.28 percent compared with the same period last year. However, judging from the national scope, the campaign is not deep and widespread enough, especially since most provincial, special district, and county-level state-owned trade departments have not launched it. Therefore, the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government recently issued a circular instructing state-owned trade departments at all levels to fully launch industrial product promotion campaigns, so that the industrial product promotion campaign penetrates the grassroots units of state-owned trade in various provinces, special districts, and counties, and quickly changes the situation of "the top moving but the bottom not moving." In the units where the campaign has already been launched, in-depth inspection of promotion plans should be carried out, advanced working methods should be promoted, and difficulties should be constantly overcome to continue to push the campaign forward. The circular pointed out that in order to fully launch the industrial product promotion campaign, the provincial-level people's governments and state-owned trade departments must attach importance to and strengthen the leadership of the campaign, ensuring that the heads of each unit personally grasp it, relying on all employees, and inspiring the vast number of employees to consciously put forward rationalization proposals, promptly reward employees' creations and inventions, and summarize experience. In the industrial product promotion campaign, state-owned trade departments must resolutely implement the policy of focusing on wholesale in business, vigorously rely on cooperatives, hold primary market materials exchange fairs well, and organize private merchants to go to the countryside to promote industrial products. After the campaign is launched, the work of material allocation must be strictly organized to prevent supply disruptions. The circular also pointed out that the welfare problems of employees of state-owned trade departments in various regions should be resolved quickly, and welfare funds can be used.

### 中央人民政府商业部发出通报　全面开展工业品推销运动

    中央人民政府商业部发出通报
  　全面开展工业品推销运动
    【新华社三十日讯】全国各地秋收农作物已经陆续上市。供应大量工业品给农民和充实国家收购资金以满足农民出售农产品的要求，已成为国营贸易部门当前的迫切任务。因此，中央人民政府商业部最近发出通报，指示各地国营贸易部门进一步全面开展工业品推销运动。
    全国国营贸易系统的工业品推销竞赛运动，最近已在各大行政区、大行政区辖市和部分省级单位内展开。但大部分省级和部分专区、县级国营贸易单位，八月初还处在准备阶段；个别省则还未注意此项工作。在运动已经展开的单位，大都经过了动员、清理仓库、商品排队、调整价格等准备阶段和想办法找主顾的行动阶段，目前正在深入发展中。在各大行政区中，以西南区国营贸易系统的运动开展较快；西南区工业品推销运动在八月初就已在专区一级和部分县一级的国营贸易系统中展开。
    全国各地国营贸易系统在已经展开工业品推销运动的单位，广大职工都积极行动起来，因此使业务气象一新。国营贸易部门职工七月份在运动中提出的合理化建议，又多又好，在华东区有二千八百十七件，已采用一千三百七十七件；西北区有六百二十九件，已采用二百三十八件；天津市有一千三百五十三件，已采用四百八十九件。许多建议采用后，大大地改进了业务，提高了工作效率，并为国家创造了巨额财富。例如：华东区工业器材公司职工学习苏联先进经验改进卡车运载装车法，把每个平板车装卡车一辆提高到三个平板车装卡车八辆，因此七月份节省运费十亿元以上。华东区百货公司第四仓库改进棉织品包装法，采用这个方法后，预计下半年仅收购卫生衫一项就可节省包装费、运费五十亿元。天津市国营贸易部门由于采纳了职工们四百八十九件合理化建议，节省了商品经营费用六十六亿元。
    许多国营贸易单位在推销运动中依靠合作社和团结私商，贯彻了以批发为主的业务方针。如河北省百货公司在运动中和全省一千二百零五个合作社建立了联系。天津专区杨柳青百货公司由于取得了合作社的有力支持，七月份批发给合作社销出的货物价值占七月份总销售金额的百分之六十八，并使全月销货计划在二十二天内就告完成。华东区石油公司先后两次召开公私营企业代表座谈会，实事求是地宣传了国产和苏联及东欧新民主主义国家进口油料的优点，因而改变了用油户历来使用英美油料的习惯。又如上海市工业器材公司和平原省焦作百货公司等单位都曾召开私营厂商座谈会，使私商和国营公司建立了正常的业务关系。
    此外，有些地方的国营贸易单位在运动中配合了初级市场物资交流会，销出了大批工业品。
    工业品推销运动开展后，已取得了很大成绩。如七月份全国国营贸易系统内销回笼实绩比六月份增加了百分之二十六点九，比去年同期增加了百分之七十五点二八；但就全国范围看，运动还不够深入普遍，特别是大部分省、专区和县一级国营贸易部门还没有开展起来。因此，最近中央人民政府商业部特发出通报，指示各级国营贸易部门全面开展工业品推销运动，使推销工业品运动深入到全国各省、专区、县国营贸易的基层单位，迅速改变上动下不动的情况。在运动已经开展的单位，应深入检查推销计划，推广先进的工作方法，不断克服困难，把运动继续推向前进。通报指出：为了全面开展工业品推销运动，省一级人民政府和国营贸易部门必须重视和加强对于运动的领导，做到各单位首长亲自掌握，依靠全体职工，启发广大职工自觉地提出合理化建议，及时奖励职工的创造、发明和总结经验。在工业品推销运动中，国营贸易部门业务上须坚决贯彻以批发为主的方针，大力依靠合作社，开好初级市场物资交流会，并组织私商下乡推销工业品。运动开展后，须严密组织物资调拨工作，以防供应脱节。通报中还指出：各地国营贸易部门职工福利问题应迅速解决，福利基金可以动用。
