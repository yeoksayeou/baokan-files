Editor's Note: The newspaper "Pravda" published Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's report to be delivered at the 19th Party Congress – "Amendments to the Charter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", this is an outline.

Additions and amendments to the Party Charter are now submitted to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) for consideration. These additions and amendments are necessary because some provisions of the Party Charter are outdated, and the Charter must reflect the experience accumulated by the Party in party building over the many years since the 18th Congress.

I. On the New Name of the Party and the Provisions in the Party Charter Regarding the Party's Main Tasks

It is now highly necessary to make the name of our Party more accurate. In the future, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) should be called the "Communist Party of the Soviet Union" because: A, this name of the Party – the Communist Party of the Soviet Union – is more accurate; B, it is no longer necessary to retain the dual name of the Party – Communist Party and Bolsheviks, because the meanings of the two terms "Communist" and "Bolshevik" are now completely the same.

Chapter I of the Party Charter should be titled "The Party, Party Members, and the Duties and Rights of Party Members". Before stipulating the duties and rights of party members, a brief description of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its main tasks should be provided in Article 1 of Chapter I. The wording of this article is as follows:

"Article 1: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a voluntary and militant union of like-minded communists from the working class, working peasantry, and working intelligentsia.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union organized the alliance of the working class and the working peasantry, overthrew the rule of capitalists and landlords through the October Revolution of 1917, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, eradicated capitalism, eliminated the exploitation of man by man, and ensured the establishment of a socialist society.

At present, the main tasks of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are: to build a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism, to gradually improve the material and cultural levels of society, to educate members of society in the spirit of internationalism and fraternal ties with the working people of all countries, and to extremely strengthen the active defense of the socialist motherland against the aggressive actions of its enemies."

Due to the above circumstances, the Party Charter should not have a preamble.

II. Who Can Join the Party?

In order to make the title of Communist Party member more lofty and increase its importance, it is recommended that the provisions in the Party Charter regarding who can join the Party be given a new wording: "Article 2: Any worker, any citizen of the Soviet Union who does not exploit the labor of others, recognizes the Party's program and charter, actively promotes their realization, works in a Party organization, and executes all Party resolutions may become a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Party members must pay a certain amount of Party dues."

The Party Charter states that any worker, any citizen of the Soviet Union who does not exploit the labor of others, may become a party member, thus ensuring the Party's established achievements and reflecting the fact that the Communist Party is composed of workers, working peasants, and working intellectuals.

Due to the victory of socialism, the exploiting classes have been eliminated in our country, and the phenomenon of man exploiting man no longer exists. Soviet society is composed of friendly classes. The moral and political unity of the Soviet people has been consolidated.

The new tasks undertaken by the Communist Party in the cause of building a communist society require party members to have a higher sense of responsibility to the cause of the Party. Therefore, the new wording of this article regarding party members points out that only those who not only recognize the Party's program and charter but also actively promote their realization and execute all Party resolutions may become Communist Party members.

III. Duties of Party Members

Experience shows that the duties of party members should be stipulated in more detail in the Party Charter.

First of all, in the article on the duties of party members, it must be stipulated that any party member must do everything possible to safeguard the unity of the Party, which is the main and necessary condition for the Party's strength and power. Wholeheartedly safeguarding the unity of the Party is the primary responsibility of every party member, and therefore, it is entirely correct to put forward this basic requirement first when stipulating the duties of party members. In order to further enhance the vanguard role of party members in the activities of building communism and overcoming shortcomings and undesirable phenomena in the life and work of party organizations, new provisions must be added to this article on the duties of party members in the Party Charter.

It should be pointed out that there are many party members who adopt a passive and perfunctory attitude towards the implementation of Party resolutions. This is a serious evil that the Party must resolutely fight against, because when Communist Party members adopt such an attitude towards Party resolutions, it weakens the Party's combat effectiveness. The Party Charter must stipulate that party members must actively struggle to implement Party resolutions, and that a Communist Party member's passive and perfunctory attitude towards Party resolutions is incompatible with the status of a party member.

Another evil that has appeared in our Party is that some Communist Party members mistakenly believe that there are two kinds of discipline in our Party – one for ordinary party members and another for leaders. The Party cannot tolerate this arrogant and unreasonable anti-Party view of discipline. This evil must also be resolutely eradicated, because it undermines Party and state discipline, thereby greatly damaging the interests of the Party and the state. The Party Charter must point out that our Party has only one discipline, one law, and all Communist Party members, regardless of their merits and positions, should abide by it; violating Party and state discipline is incompatible with the status of a party member.

Secondly, it is certain that those Communist Party members who constantly say they are loyal to the Party but in reality do not allow criticism from below and stifle criticism cause no small damage to the Party. The Party has always attached great importance to carrying out self-criticism, especially criticism from below, exposing shortcomings in work, opposing complacency with superficial achievements, and opposing being dizzy with success in work. However, experience shows that it is not enough to merely explain the significance of criticism. A resolute struggle must be waged against those who hinder the development of criticism. Therefore, the Party Charter must point out that suppressing criticism is a serious evil. Those who stifle criticism, are arrogant, and like flattery cannot remain in the Party's ranks.

In this regard, it must be stated that there is a harmful opinion among some Communist Party members who believe that party members should not report shortcomings in their work to the Party's leading organs, up to the Party's Central Committee. Often, some responsible workers prevent Communist Party members from reporting unsatisfactory situations to the Party's leading organs, to the Central Committee, on the grounds that such practices would hinder their work. Obviously, the Party must wage an irreconcilable struggle against such big shots. The current Party Charter stipulates that party members have the right to submit any statement to any level of Party organs, up to the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party. This is obviously not enough. The Party Charter must point out that party members not only have the right but also the obligation to report shortcomings in their work to the Party's leading organs, up to the Party's Central Committee, regardless of who is involved in the report; as for those who hinder party members from fulfilling this obligation, the Party Charter must stipulate that such people should be severely punished as those who violate the Party's will.

In addition, a serious evil prevalent among some Communist Party members is concealing the truth from the Party, and being disloyal and dishonest to the Party. Obviously, the Party cannot allow people who deceive the Party to exist in its ranks, because such people will shake people's trust in the Party and morally corrupt the Communist Party's ranks. The Party Charter must point out that a Communist Party member's disloyalty to the Party and deception of the Party is a very serious evil and is incompatible with the status of a party member.

Equally important is that the phenomena of political imprudence and vigilance and the disclosure of Party and state secrets are quite common among Communist Party members. Political vigilance is very important for every Communist Party member, regardless of what department they work in or under what circumstances. Therefore, the Party Charter must stipulate that party members must keep Party and state secrets; disclosing Party and state secrets is a crime against the Party and is therefore incompatible with the status of a party member.

Finally, it must be admitted that there is a major evil in many Party, Soviet, and economic organizations, that is, the selection of cadres by unreasonable methods, according to friendship, personal favors, hometown relationships, and family relationships. Obviously, the method of selecting personnel in this way has nothing in common with the principles stipulated by our Party and is harmful to the Party. The Party Charter must point out that party members have the obligation to resolutely implement the Party's instructions on correctly selecting cadres according to political qualities and professional abilities, and it must be pointed out that violating these instructions is incompatible with the status of a party member.

Therefore, it is necessary to:

A. Stipulate the duties of party members in the Party Charter with the following new wording:

"Article 3: Party members have the following duties:

(1) To do everything possible to safeguard the unity of the Party, which is the main and necessary condition for the Party's strength and power;

(2) To actively struggle to implement Party resolutions. It is not enough for party members to merely agree with Party resolutions; party members have the obligation to fight for the implementation of these resolutions. A Communist Party member's passive and perfunctory attitude towards Party resolutions will inevitably weaken the Party's combat effectiveness and is therefore incompatible with the status of a party member;

(3) To play an exemplary role in labor, to master professional skills, and to continuously improve production and professional skills;

(4) To strengthen ties with the masses every day, to promptly reflect the demands and needs of the working people, to explain the Party's policies and resolutions to the non-Party masses, and to always remember that the strength and invincibility of our Party lies in its inseparable flesh-and-blood ties with the people;

(5) To strive to improve their class consciousness and to master the principles of Marxism-Leninism;

(6) To abide by Party and state discipline, without exception for all party members. There cannot be two kinds of discipline in the Party, one for leaders and another for ordinary party members. The Party has only one discipline, one law, and all Communist Party members, regardless of their merits and positions, should abide by it. Violating Party and state discipline is a serious crime that harms the Party and is therefore incompatible with the status of a party member;

(7) To carry out self-criticism and criticism from below, to expose shortcomings in work and strive to eliminate them, to oppose superficial achievements, and to oppose being dizzy with success in work. Suppressing criticism is a serious evil. Those who stifle criticism, are arrogant, and like flattery cannot remain in the Party's ranks;

(8) To report shortcomings in their work to the Party's leading organs, up to the Party's Central Committee, regardless of who is involved in the report. Party members have no right to conceal unsatisfactory situations and to ignore incorrect actions that harm the interests of the Party and the government. Those who hinder party members from fulfilling this obligation should be severely punished as those who violate the Party's will;

(9) To be loyal and honest to the Party, and not to conceal or distort the truth. A Communist Party member's disloyalty to the Party and deception of the Party is a very serious evil and is incompatible with the status of a party member;

(10) To keep Party and state secrets, to maintain political vigilance, and to always remember that Communist Party members must be vigilant at all times and under all circumstances. Disclosing Party and state secrets is a crime against the Party and is therefore incompatible with the status of a party member;

(11) In any position entrusted by the Party, to resolutely implement the Party's instructions on correctly selecting cadres according to political qualities and professional abilities. All acts of violating these instructions and selecting personnel according to friendship, personal favors, hometown relationships, and family relationships are incompatible with the status of a party member."

B. In the chapter of the Party Charter entitled "The Party, Party Members, and the Duties and Rights of Party Members", it is necessary to include the following supplementary provisions:

"Article 11: If a Communist Party member is a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of a Union Republic, a member of the Party's Border Region Committee, a member of the Provincial Committee, a member of the Special Region Committee, a member of the Municipal Committee, or a member of the District Committee, the Party's primary organization cannot make a decision to expel him from the Party.

The issue of removing a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of a Union Republic, a member of the Party's Border Region Committee, a member of the Provincial Committee, a member of the Special Region Committee, a member of the Municipal Committee, or a member of the District Committee from his position or expelling him from the Party shall be decided by a plenary session of the relevant committee if two-thirds of the members of the plenary session vote that it is necessary.

Article 12: The issue of removing a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from his position on the Central Committee or expelling him from the Party shall be decided by the Party Congress, or, between two congresses, by a plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with a two-thirds majority vote of the Central Committee plenary session. After the removal of a Central Committee member, the vacancy shall be filled by a candidate member of the Central Committee in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Congress when electing candidate members of the Central Committee."

IV. Rights of Party Members

In the current Party Charter, the scope of party members' rights is relatively narrow, and the wording is not precise enough. The wording of Article 3 in the current Party Charter must be replaced with the following wording:

"Article 4: Party members have the following rights:

(1) To participate in free and earnest discussions of Party policy issues at Party meetings or in the Party press;

(2) To criticize any Party worker at Party meetings;

(3) To elect and be elected to Party organs;

(4) To demand to participate in person whenever a resolution regarding their activities or behavior is passed;

(5) To submit any questions and statements to any level of Party organs, up to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."

V. On Candidate Party Members

A serious shortcoming in the work of party organizations at all levels is that they do not do enough to help candidate party members prepare to join the Party, and they do not examine whether individual candidate party members have already met the conditions for joining the Party. As a result, the probationary period often becomes a formality, and many candidate party members have probationary periods that last for many years. The Party cannot tolerate this shortcoming. Party organizations at all levels should improve their work with candidate party members, and the responsibilities of individual candidate party members during the probationary period should also be strengthened.

Therefore, the following supplementary provisions must be included in the chapter on "Candidate Party Members" in the Party Charter:

"Party organizations must help candidate party members prepare to join the Party. At the end of the probationary period, the party organization shall address the issue of candidate party members at a Party meeting. If a candidate party member has not reached the level of joining the Party for some reason, and these reasons are deemed valid by the party organization, the Party's primary organization may extend his probationary period, but not by more than one year. If it is discovered during the probationary period that a candidate party member is not suitable for admission to the Party due to his personal qualities, the party organization may decide to revoke his candidate party member status."

VI. On the Time Limit for Convening Congresses and Plenary Sessions of the Party Central Committee

Experience has shown that the following provisions should be made regarding the time limit for convening Party Congresses and plenary sessions of the Party Central Committee:

Regular Party Congresses shall be convened at least once every four years;

Plenary sessions of the Party Central Committee shall be convened at least once every six months.

VII. On the All-Union Party Conference

The draft Party Charter does not contain provisions regarding the All-Union Party Conference. Under the current circumstances, it is not necessary to convene the All-Union Party Conference, because urgent issues regarding the Party's policies can be discussed at the Party Congress and plenary sessions of the Central Committee.

VIII. On the Issue of Reorganizing the Politburo into the Presidium of the Party Central Committee

The Politburo should be reorganized into the Presidium of the Party Central Committee to handle the work of the Central Committee between plenary sessions, because the name "Presidium" is more in line with the powers actually exercised by the Politburo at present. As for the current organizational work of the Central Committee, practical experience has shown that it is appropriate to concentrate this work in the hands of one institution – the Secretariat – for handling; therefore, the Organizational Bureau of the Central Committee will no longer exist.

In view of this, Article 34 of the Party Charter must be worded as follows:

"The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union shall establish a Presidium and a Secretariat: the Presidium shall handle the work of the Central Committee between plenary sessions, and the Secretariat shall handle day-to-day work, mainly organizing the inspection of the implementation of Party resolutions and the selection of cadres." (Xinhua News Agency note: In the previous issue of this agency, "The Full Text of the Draft Amendment to the Charter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," Article 34 was "…organizing the inspection of the implementation of Party resolutions and the work of selecting cadres." Please correct it according to this translation.)

IX. On the Issue of Reorganizing the Party Control Committee into the Party Control Committee of the Party Central Committee

In order to strengthen the role of the Party Control Committee in the struggle against acts of violating Party discipline and against situations in which Communist Party members fail to satisfactorily complete their tasks, the Party Control Committee should be reorganized into the Party Control Committee of the Party Central Committee, and a system should be established whereby authorized representatives dispatched by the Party Control Committee of the Party Central Committee and not subject to the jurisdiction of local Party organs are stationed in various localities. The Party Control Committee of the Party Central Committee will be responsible for inspecting the observance of Party discipline by Party members and candidate Party members, punishing Communist Party members and candidate Party members who violate the Party's program and charter and violate Party ethics, and reviewing appeals against decisions by the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, and the Party's Border Region and Provincial Committees regarding expulsion from the Party and intra-Party disciplinary actions.

Therefore, the wording of Article 35 of the Party Charter must be changed as follows:

"The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union shall establish a Party Control Committee of the Central Committee.

The Party Control Committee of the Party Central Committee:

(1) Inspects the observance of Party discipline by Party members and candidate Party members, punishes Party members and candidate Party members who violate the Party's program and charter and the discipline of the Party and the state, as well as Party members and candidate Party members who violate Party ethics (deceiving the Party, being disloyal and dishonest to the Party, slandering, bureaucracy, licentious personal life, etc.);

(2) Reviews appeals against decisions by the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, and the Party's Border Region and Provincial Committees regarding expulsion from the Party and intra-Party disciplinary actions;

(3) Dispatches authorized representatives to reside in various republics, border regions, and provinces, and these representatives are not subject to the jurisdiction of local Party organs."

X. On the Organs of the Party Central Committee and Local Party Organizations

Experience has shown that the structure of Party organizations should change with the situation and specific circumstances. Therefore, it should not be stipulated in the Party Charter that departments and sections be established in the Party Central Committee and local Party organizations.

XI. On Stipulating the Tasks of Local Party Organizations

Experience has shown that the Party Charter does not fully reflect the tasks and responsibilities of local Party organizations. Therefore, the following provisions must be added to the articles in the Party Charter concerning the tasks of local Party organizations: the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, the Party's Border Region Committees, Provincial Committees, Special Region Committees, Municipal Committees, and District Committees, ensure the correct implementation of the Party's instructions, and guide the activities of these organizations through Party groups in local Soviets and public organizations. The Party Charter must reflect the tasks of Party organizations at all levels in carrying out Party criticism and self-criticism and in educating Party members in the spirit of irreconcilable struggle against shortcomings in Party and state work. The Party Charter must also stipulate that Party organizations at all levels have the important tasks of conducting communist education for the working people and guiding Party members and candidate Party members to study Marxism-Leninism, especially keeping in mind that the organization of Marxist-Leninist propaganda work is not yet satisfactory.

In addition, in order to more effectively study current issues and to ensure better organization of the inspection of the implementation of resolutions, the Party Charter must also stipulate that the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, the Party's Border Region Committees, and the Provincial Committees establish Secretariats. In order to prevent the Secretariats from replacing the Standing Committees of the Provincial Committees, Border Region Committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, the number of Secretaries of the Secretariats should be reduced to three. The Secretariats shall be responsible for submitting reports on the resolutions they have passed to the Standing Committees of the Provincial Committees, Border Region Committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics.

Finally, in order to promptly remedy any shortcomings in the work of local Party organizations and to ensure the accumulation of useful experience in their work, the Provincial Committees, Border Region Committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics must be instructed to regularly report on their activities to the Party Central Committee in a systematic manner and to submit reports to the Central Committee on the dates specified.

Therefore, the following supplementary and amended provisions must be included in the several chapters of the Party Charter concerning local Party organizations:

A. The following provisions shall be added to the articles in the Party Charter concerning the responsibilities of local Party organizations and primary Party organizations:

Ensure the correct implementation of the Party's instructions, carry out criticism and self-criticism from the Party's point of view, and educate Party members in the spirit of irreconcilable struggle against shortcomings, guide the Marxist-Leninist study of Party members and candidate Party members, organize and supervise the political education of Party members and candidate Party members, so that they obtain basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, organize communist education for the working people, and guide the activities of these organizations through Party groups in local Soviets and public organizations.

B. Supplement Article 42 of the Party Charter on the executive organs of local Party Committees as follows:

"The Party's Provincial Committees, Border Region Committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics shall establish Secretariats to handle day-to-day issues and inspect the implementation of resolutions. The Secretariats shall submit reports on the resolutions they have passed to the Standing Committees of the Provincial Committees, Border Region Committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics."

The same article of the Party Charter shall specify that the Provincial Committees, Border Region Committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics shall each have three Secretaries.

C. Add the following provision to Article 43 of the Party Charter: The Provincial Committees, Border Region Committees, and Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics shall regularly report on their activities to the Party Central Committee in a systematic manner and submit reports to the Central Committee on the dates specified.

XII. On the Issue of the Time Limit for Convening Plenary Sessions of the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, the Party's Border Region Committees, Provincial Committees, Special Region Committees, Municipal Committees, and District Committees

The following provisions shall be made in the Party Charter regarding the time limit for convening plenary sessions of the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, the Party's Border Region Committees, Provincial Committees, Special Region Committees, Municipal Committees, and District Committees:

Plenary sessions of the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, the Party's Border Region Committees, and Provincial Committees shall be held at least once every two months;

Plenary sessions of the Party's Special Region Committees shall be convened at least once every one and a half months;

Plenary sessions of the Party's Municipal and District Committees shall be convened at least once every month.

XIII. On Party Dues for Party Members and Candidate Party Members

An amendment must be stipulated in the Party Charter to reduce the monthly Party dues paid by Party members and candidate Party members. Therefore, Articles 70 and 71 of the Party Charter shall be worded as follows:

"Article 70: The monthly Party dues paid by Party members and candidate Party members, the amount of which (calculated as a percentage of their income) is stipulated as follows:

For monthly wages not exceeding 500 rubles – 0.5 percent;

For wages above 500 rubles and below 1,000 rubles – 1 percent;

For wages from 1,001 rubles to 1,500 rubles – 1.5 percent;

For wages from 1,501 rubles to 2,000 rubles – 2 percent;

For wages exceeding 2,000 rubles – 3 percent.

Article 71: Those who join the Party as candidate Party members shall pay an admission fee, the amount of which shall be 2 percent of their monthly wage."

### 赫鲁舍切夫关于苏联共产党党章修正案的报告提纲

1952-08-29
第3版()
专栏：

    赫鲁舍切夫关于苏联共产党党章修正案的报告提纲
    编者按：真理报刊载了恩·斯·赫鲁舍切夫同志将在第十九次党代表大会上作的报告——“苏联共产党（布尔什维克）党章修正案”的提纲。
    党章的补充和修正条文现在提交苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会审议。这些补充和修正条文之所以成为必要，是由于党章中的某些条文已经过时，而且党章必须反映党在第十八次代表大会以后的许多年来积累的建党方面的经验。
    一、关于党的新名称和党章中关于党的主要任务的规定
    现在已十分需要使我们党的名称更加确切了。今后，应该把苏联共产党（布尔什维克）称为“苏联共产党”，因为：甲、党的这一个名称——苏联共产党——更加确切；乙、现在没有必要保留党的双重名称——共产党和布尔什维克，因为“共产党”和“布尔什维克”两个名词的意义已经完全一样。
    党章的第一章应该称为“党。党员和党员的义务与权利”。在规定党员的义务与权利前，应该在第一章第一条中对苏联共产党及其主要任务作简短的说明。这一条条文如下：
    “第一条　苏联共产党是工人阶级、劳动农民和劳动知识分子中思想一致的共产主义者所组成的自愿的战斗联盟。
    苏联共产党组织了工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，经过一九一七年的十月革命，推翻了资本家和地主的政权，建立了无产阶级专政，肃清了资本主义，消灭了人对人的剥削并保证了社会主义社会的建立。
    现在，苏联共产党的主要任务是：通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径来建立共产主义社会，逐步提高社会的物质和文化水平，用国际主义及与各国劳动人民建立兄弟联系的精神来教育社会成员，极度加强社会主义祖国对其敌人侵略行动的积极防御。”
    由于上述情形，党章就不该有绪言了。　　二、什么人可以入党？
    为了使共产党员的称号更加崇高并增加其重要性，特建议对党章中关于什么人可以入党的条文给以新的措词：“第二条　苏联任何劳动者、任何公民，凡是不剥削他人的劳动、承认党纲党章、积极促其实现、在党的一个组织中工作并执行党的一切决议的，均得成为苏联共产党党员。
    党员必须缴纳一定数额的党费。”
    党章中说，苏联任何劳动者、任何公民，凡是不剥削他人劳动的，均得成为党员，这样就确保了党的既得成就，也反映了共产党是由工人、劳动农民和劳动知识分子所组成的这一事实。
    由于社会主义获得了胜利，我国已消灭了剥削阶级，人剥削人的现象已不存在。苏维埃社会是由友好的阶级组成的。苏联人民在道德—政治上的团结已经巩固了。
    共产党在共产主义社会建设事业中所担当的新任务，要求党员对党的事业有更高的责任心。因此，关于党员的这一条的新措词指出：不仅承认党纲党章，而且要积极促其实现，并执行党的一切决议的人，始得成为共产党员。
    三、党员的义务
    经验证明：党章中应对党员的义务作较详尽的规定。
    首先，在关于党员的义务这一条中，必须规定：任何党员必须尽力护卫党的统一，这是党之所以有力量和强大的主要的必要条件。全心全意护卫党的统一是每个党员的首要职责，因此，在规定党员的义务时，首先提出这个基本要求是完全正确的。　为了更加提高党员在建设共产主义、在克服党组织内生活和工作上的缺点和不良现象的活动中的先锋作用，必须在党章中关于党员义务的这一条里面增加新的规定。
    应当指出，有不少党员对于执行党的决议采取消极的阳奉阴违的态度。这是党必须与之坚决斗争的一种严重的恶行，因为共产党员对党的决议采取这种态度，就会削弱党的战斗力。党章必须规定：党员必须为实现党的决议而积极斗争，共产党员对党的决议采取消极的阳奉阴违的态度，是和党员的身份不相容的。
    在我们党内出现的另一种恶行是：有些共产党员错误地认为：我们党内有两种纪律——一种是对普通党员的纪律，另一种是对领导人的纪律。党不能容许这种骄横无理的反党的纪律观点。这种恶行也必须坚决地予以根除，因为它破坏党和国家的纪律，从而大大地损害了党和国家的利益。党章中必须指出：我们的党只有一个纪律，一个法律，一切共产党员不管他的功绩和职位如何均应遵守；破坏党和国家的纪律，是与党员的身份不相容的。
    其次，那些不断在嘴里说忠实于党，而实际上却不许下面批评并窒息批评的共产党员，对党所造成的损害是不小的，这一点是肯定的。党一向十分重视开展自我批评，特别是自下面的批评，揭露工作中的缺点，反对满足于表面成绩的情绪，反对由于工作中的成绩而冲昏头脑。可是，经验证明：仅仅解释批评的意义是不够的。对妨碍展开批评的人必须进行坚决的斗争。因此，党章中必须指出：压制批评是严重的恶行。凡是窒息批评、自高自大、喜欢奉承的人，都不能留在党的队伍里。
    在这一方面，必须说明一点：在若干共产党员中间存在着一种有害的意见，他们认为：党员不应该向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点。往往有些负责的工作人员阻止共产党员向党的领导机关，向中央委员会报告不能令人满意的情况，理由据说是这种作法会妨碍他们的工作。显然，党必须对这种大人先生进行不调和的斗争。现行的党章规定，党员有权利向党的任何一级机关直到联共中央提出任何声明。这显然是不够的。必须在党章中指出：党员不仅有权利，而且有义务向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点，不管报告牵涉到什么人；至于妨碍党员履行这项义务的人，党章中必须规定：这种人应作为违背党的意志的人而予以严惩。
    此外，在若干共产党员中间流行着一种严重的恶行，就是向党隐瞒事实真相，对党不忠诚、不老实。显然，党不能容许它的队伍中有欺骗党的人存在，因为这种人会动摇人们对党的信任，在道德上腐蚀共产党的队伍。必须在党章中指出：共产党员不忠实于党和欺骗党，是很严重的恶行，是与党员的身份不相容的。
    同样不可忽略的是：在共产党员中间，政治上不谨慎和不警惕的现象和泄露党和国家机密的事情，是相当普遍的。每一个共产党员，无论在什么部门工作，无论在什么情况之下，政治警惕性是非常重要的。因此，党章上必须规定：党员必须保守党和国家的机密；泄露党和国家的机密，就是对党犯罪，因而是与党员的身份不相容的。
    最后，必须承认：在党、苏维埃和经济的许多组织中，有一种重大的恶行，这就是用不合理的方法选拔干部，按照朋友关系、私人情面、同乡和亲戚关系选拔干部。显然，像这样选拔工作人员的办法，与我们党所规定的原则毫无共同之处，而且是对党有害的。党章必须指出党员有坚决执行党关于按照政治品质和业务能力正确选拔干部的指示的义务，并且必须指明违反这些指示是与党员的身份不相容的。
    因此，必须：
    甲、以下面的新措词来规定党章中关于党员的义务：
    “第三条　党员有下列义务：
    （一）尽力护卫党的统一，这是党之所以有力量和强大的主要的必要条件；
    　    （二）为实现党的决议而积极斗争。对于党员来说，仅仅同意党的决议是不够的，党员有义务为实现这些决议而奋斗。共产党员对党的决议采取消极的阳奉阴违的态度，就必然会削弱党的战斗力，因此，这是与党员的身份不相容的；
    （三）在劳动中起模范作用，精通业务，不断提高生产和业务技能；
    （四）每日巩固与群众的联系，及时反映劳动人民的要求和需要，向非党群众解释党的政策和决议，时时记住我党之所以有力量和不可战胜就在于它和人民有着不可分割的血肉联系；
    （五）努力提高自己的阶级觉悟，精通马克思主义—列宁主义的原则；
    （六）遵守党和国家的纪律，一切党员均无例外。党内不能有两种纪律，不能对领导人有一种纪律，对普通党员又有一种纪律。党只有一个纪律，一个法律，一切共产党员不管他的功绩和职位如何，均应遵守。破坏党和国家的纪律，是损害党的严重罪恶，因此，是与党员的身份不相容的；
    （七）展开自我批评和自下面的批评，揭露工作中的缺点并努力加以消灭，反对表面成绩，反对因为工作中的成绩而冲昏头脑。压制批评是严重的恶行。凡是窒息批评、自高自大、喜欢奉承的人，都不能留在党的队伍里；
    （八）向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点，不管报告牵涉到什么人。党员无权隐瞒不能令人满意的情况和不过问损害党及政府的利益的不正确行动。凡是妨碍党员履行这项义务的人应作为违背党的意志的人而予以严惩；
    （九）对党忠诚老实，不隐瞒和歪曲事实真相。共产党员不忠实于党和欺骗党，是很严重的恶行，是与党员的身份不相容的；
    （十）保守党和国家的机密，保持政治警惕性，时时记得共产党员在任何时候、在任何情况下都必须保持警惕。泄露党和国家的机密，就是对党犯罪，因而是与党员的身份不相容的；
    （十一）在党所付托的任何岗位上，坚决执行党关于按照政治品质和业务能力正确选拔干部的指示。凡是破坏这种指示，按照朋友关系、私人情面、同乡和亲戚关系选拔工作人员的行为，都是与党员的身份不相容的。”
    乙、在党章中题为“党。党员和党员的义务与权利”的那一章里面，列入下列的补充条文，是必要的：
    “第十一条　如果一个共产党员是苏联共产党中央委员、加盟共和国共产党中央委员、党的边疆区委员会委员、州委员会委员、专区委员会委员、市委员会委员、区委员会委员，党的基层组织不能作出开除他的党籍的决议。
    撤销加盟共和国共产党中央委员、党的边疆区委员会委员、州委员会委员、专区委员会委员、市委员会委员、区委员会委员的委员职务或开除其党籍的问题，由各该委员会的全体会议决定，如果全体会议三分之二的人投票决定这是必要的话。
    第十二条　解除苏联共产党中央委员的中委职务或开除其党籍的问题由党的代表大会，或在两次代表大会之间由苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议以中央委员会全体会议三分之二的多数决定。在撤销一个中央委员的职务后，遗缺由候补中央委员按照代表大会在选举候补中央委员时所规定的程序自行递补。”
    四、关于党员的权利
    在现行的党章中，党员权利的范围比较狭窄，措词也不够确切。必须以下列措词代替现行党章中第三条的措词：
    “第四条　党员有下列权利：
    （一）在党的会议上或在党的报刊上参加党的政策问题的自由的、认真的讨论；
    （二）在党的会议上批评党的任何工作人员；
    （三）选举和被选举到党的机关；
    （四）凡在通过关于自己的活动或行为的决议时，要求亲自参加；
    （五）向党的任何一级机关直到苏联共产党中央委员会提出任何问题和声明。”
    五、关于候补党员
    各级党组织工作中的一个严重的缺点是：它们在帮助候补党员准备入党的工作方面，做得很不够，而且不审查候补党员个人是否已经具有入党的条件，结果候补期时常流于形式，而且有许多候补党员的候补期限长达许多年，党不能容忍这个缺点。各级党组织对于候补党员的工作应该予以改进，候补党员个人在候补期间的责任，也应该加强。
    因此，必须在党章中关于“候补党员”的一章里面列入以下的补充条文：
    “党组织必须帮助候补党员准备入党。在候补期限届满时，党组织应在党的会议上处理候补党员的问题。如果候补党员由于某些原因没有达到入党水平，而这些原因为党组织认为可以成立，则党的基层组织可以延长他的候补期限，但不得超过一年。如果在候补期间发现候补党员由于个人的品质不宜接收入党，党组织可决定取消他的候补党员资格。”
    六、关于召集代表大会和党中央委员会全体会议的期限
    经验证明，关于召集党代表大会和党中央委员会全体会议的期限宜作如下规定：
    党代表大会例会至少每四年召集一次；
    党中央委员会全体会议至少每六个月召集一次。
    七、关于全苏联党代表会议
    党章草案中没有关于全苏联党代表会议的条文。在现在的情况下，没有必要召集全苏联党代表会议，因为关于党的政策的紧急问题可以在党代表大会和中央委员会全体会议上讨论。
    八、关于把政治局改组为党中央委员会主席团的问题
    应该把政治局改组为党中央委员会主席团，在前后两次全体会议之间处理中央委员会的工作，因为“主席团”这个名称更符合于现在的政治局实际上行使的职权。至于目前中央委员会的组织工作，实践证明，宜于把这种工作集中交给一个机构——书记处——处理，因此，中央委员会组织局将不复存在。
    有鉴于此，党章第三十四条必须措词如下：
    “苏联共产党中央委员会成立主席团和书记处：主席团在前后两次全体会议之间处理中央委员会的工作，书记处处理日常工作，主要是组织对党的决议执行情况进行检查和选拔干部的工作。”（新华社按：本社前发“苏联共产党关于党章的修正草案全文”中第三十四条为“……组织对党的决议执行情况和选拔干部工作进行检查。”，请照此次译文更正。）
    九、关于把党监察委员会改组为党中央委员会的党监察委员会问题
    为了要加强党监察委员会在与破坏党纪的行为及与共产党员未能令人满意地完成任务的情况进行斗争时的作用，应该把党监察委员会改组为党中央委员会的党监察委员会，并建立一种由党中央委员会的党监察委员会派遣不受地方党机关管辖的受权代表分驻各地的制度。党中央委员会的党监察委员会将负责检查党员和候补党员遵守党的纪律的情况，处分破坏党纲党章和违反党的道德的共产党员和候补党员，并审查对加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、党的边疆区和州委员会关于开除党籍和党内处分的决议提出的申诉。
    因此，党章第三十五条的措词必须更改如下：
    “苏联共产党中央委员会成立中央委员会的党监察委员会。
    党中央委员会的党监察委员会：
    （一）检查党员和候补党员遵守党的纪律的情况，处分破坏党纲党章及党和国家的纪律的党员和候补党员，以及违反党的道德的党员和候补党员（欺骗党，对党不忠诚老实，侮蔑毁谤，官僚主义，个人生活放荡等等）；
    （二）审查对加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、党的边疆区和州委员会关于开除党籍和党内处分的决议提出的申诉；
    （三）派遣受权代表驻在各共和国、边疆区和各州，这些代表不受地方党机关的管辖。”
    十、关于党中央委员会与地方党组织的机构
    经验证明：党组织的机构是要随着形势与具体情况而改变的。因此，不应在党章中规定在党中央委员会与党地方组织中设立部与处。
    十一、关于规定地方党组织的任务
    经验证明：党章未能充分反映地方党组织的任务与职责。因此，必须在党章中有关规定地方党组织的任务的各条中补充下列规定：加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、党的边疆区委员会、州委员会、专区委员会、市委员会和区委员会，保证正确执行党的指令，并通过地方苏维埃和公共组织中的党组指导这些组织的活动。必须在党章中反映出各级党组织在开展党的批评与自我批评以及用对党和国家工作中的缺点进行不调和的斗争的精神教育党员这方面的任务。党章还必须规定各级党组织有对劳动人民进行共产主义教育和指导党员与候补党员学习马克思主义—列宁主义等重要任务，特别是要记住：马克思主义—列宁主义的宣传工作组织得还不能令人满意。
    此外，为了更有效地研究当前的问题，并保证更好地组织对执行决议的情况的检查，党章还必须规定各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、党的边疆区委员会和州委员会成立书记处。为着防止书记处代替了州委员会、边疆区委员会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会的常务委员会，要把书记处的书记减为三人。书记处应负责把有关它们所已通过的决议向州委员会、边疆区委员会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会的常务委员会提出报告。
    最后，为了要及时补救地方党组织工作中的任何缺点，并保证积累它们工作中的有用的经验，必须指令州、边疆区委员会和加盟共和国共产党中央委员会有系统地向党的中央委员会经常汇报自己的活动，并在规定的日期向中央委员会提出报告。
    因此，必须在党章关于地方党组织的几章中列入下面的补充和修正条文：
    甲、在党章中有关地方党组织和基层党组织的职责的各条中补充下列规定：    
    保证正确执行党的指令，从党的观点开展批评与自我批评和用对缺点不调和的精神教育党员，指导党员和候补党员的马克思主义—列宁主义的学习，组织对党员和候补党员的政治教育并督促他们，使他们获得关于马克思主义—列宁主义的起码知识，组织对劳动人民的共产主义教育，通过各地方苏维埃和公共组织中的党组指导这些组织的活动。
    乙、补充党章中关于地方党委员会执行机构的第四十二条的规定如下：
    “党的州委员会、边疆区委员会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会成立书记处，处理日常问题并检查决议的执行情况。书记处就所已通过的决议向州委员会、边疆区委员会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会的常务委员会提出报告。”
    在党章的同一条中指出，州、边疆区委员会和加盟共和国共产党中央委员会都设三个书记。
    丙、以如下的规定补充党章的第四十三条：州委员会、边疆区委员会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会有系统地向党的中央委员会经常汇报自己的活动并在规定的日期向中央委员会提出报告。
    十二、关于召集加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、党的边疆区委员会、州委员会、专区委员会、市委员会和区委员会的全体会议的期限问题
    关于召集加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、党的边疆区委员会、州委员会、专区委员会、市委员会和区委员会的全体会议的期限，应在党章中作如下规定：
    加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、党的边疆区委员会和州委员会的全体会议，至少每两个月举行一次；
    党的专区委员会全体会议至少每一个半月召集一次；
    党的市、区委员会全体会议至少每一个月召集一次。
    十三、关于党员和候补党员的党费
    党章中必须规定一项修正，把党员和候补党员每月所缴纳的党费减低，因此，党章中第七十条和第七十一条的措词如下：
    “第七十条　党员和候补党员每月所缴纳的党费，其数额（按其收入的百分比计算）规定如下：
    每月工资不超过五百卢布者——百分之零点五；
    工资在五百卢布以上一千卢布以下者——百分之一；
    工资在一千零一卢布至一千五百卢布者——百分之一点五；
    工资在一千五百零一卢布至二千卢布者——百分之二；
    工资超过二千卢布者——百分之三。
    第七十一条　凡加入党为候补党员者，应缴纳入党费，其数额为其每月工资的百分之二。”
