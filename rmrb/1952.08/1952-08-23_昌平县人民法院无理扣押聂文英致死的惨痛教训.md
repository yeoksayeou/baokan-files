    The Painful Lesson of the Changping County People's Court's Unjustified Detention Leading to the Death of Nie Wenying
    The case of the Changping County People's Court's unjustified detention leading to the death of Nie Wenying, published in our newspaper today, exposes the serious error of local judicial workers endangering the lives of the people.
    Judging from worker Fan Yunshan's letter, the reason why such a serious error occurred in the Changping County People's Court is that the judicial workers handling this case worked with an irresponsible and bureaucratic attitude from beginning to end. Why was Nie Wenying arrested in the first place? The Changping County People's Court did not possess any reliable evidence. It was merely because Nie Wenying lived in the same courtyard as Tian Fengshi and Nie Wenying did not discover the murderer, so Nie Wenying became a "suspect in the murder." Based on this subjective conjecture, they casually arrested an innocent person. After Nie Wenying was arrested, how did the Changping County People's Court handle this case? They neither interrogated nor investigated. According to the investigation materials of the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate, although the case file of the Changping County People's Court was labeled "Nie Wenying Suspected of Murder," there was not a single piece of material or confession in the file. They disregarded the interests of the masses and detained Nie Wenying for a long time, resulting in Nie Wenying becoming ill and dying. What a serious anti-people and vile style!
    We must thoroughly reform judicial work and further strengthen the construction of people's justice. This is the lesson we should learn from the case of the Changping County People's Court's unjustified detention leading to the death of Nie Wenying. The Changping County People's Court's handling of this case was entirely based on reactionary and anti-people old legal concepts. They did not stand on the side of the people to conduct realistic investigation and research. Although they went to the scene to examine the corpse, they did not conduct a truly careful examination, nor did they deeply listen to the opinions of the masses. Instead, they replaced objective facts with subjective conjecture, resulting in a wrongful arrest. After the wrongful arrest, the court still did not attach importance to investigation and research, so the error could not be corrected in time, and the case could not be handled correctly. This is a painful lesson that deserves the serious attention of judicial workers everywhere.
    The people's government's judicial organs are tools of the people's democratic dictatorship. Their task is to protect the legitimate rights of the people, fight against illegal acts, and give offenders the legal sanctions they deserve. Therefore, in order to safeguard the interests of the people and thoroughly correct the bureaucratic style of judicial work that is divorced from the masses and reality, we suggest that the Hebei Provincial People's Government seriously handle this incident. The personnel involved in this incident should be held accountable, and appropriate punishments should be given according to the severity of their actions. The Changping County People's Court should use this incident to examine its work.

### 昌平县人民法院无理扣押聂文英致死的惨痛教训

    昌平县人民法院无理扣押聂文英致死的惨痛教训
    本报今天发表的昌平县人民法院无理扣押聂文英致死案件，暴露出当地司法工作者危害人民生命的严重错误行为。
    从工人范云山的来信看，昌平县人民法院所以发生这样严重的错误，是因为处理这个案件的司法工作者自始至终是以不负责的、官僚主义的态度在工作。聂文英究竟为什么被逮捕呢？昌平县人民法院并没有掌握任何可靠证据，只是因为聂文英和田冯氏同住一院，而聂文英没有发现凶手，所以聂文英就成了“杀人嫌疑犯”。他们根据这种主观臆断，随随便便地把一个无罪的人逮捕了。聂文英被捕之后，昌平县人民法院又是怎样处理这个案件呢？他们既不审讯，更不调查研究。据河北省人民检察署的调查材料说明，昌平县人民法院在这个案件的卷宗上，虽然写着“聂文英杀人嫌疑案”，但卷内并无一点材料和口供。他们就这样不顾群众利益，将聂文英长期羁押，以致聂文英得病而死。这是多么严重的反人民的恶劣作风！
    必须彻底改革司法工作，进一步加强人民司法的建设工作，这就是我们通过昌平县人民法院无理扣押聂文英致死案件所应该接受的教训。昌平县人民法院对这个案件的处理，完全是由反动的反人民的旧法观点出发的。他们没有站在人民的立场上实事求是地进行调查研究工作。虽然他们也曾到现场验过尸体，可是他们并没有真正慎重检验，也没有深入群众倾听群众意见，而是以主观臆断代替客观事实，发生了错捕行为。错捕之后，该院仍然不重视调查研究工作，以致错误不能及时纠正，案件不能正确处理。这是一个惨痛的教训，值得各地司法工作者严重注意。
    人民政府的司法机关，是人民民主专政的工具。它的任务在于保障人民的合法权利，并向违法行为进行斗争，给犯法者以应得的法纪制裁。因此，为了保障人民的利益，彻底纠正司法工作中脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义作风，我们建议河北省人民政府认真处理这个事件。对于这个事件有关的工作人员应该追究责任，分别轻重，给予应得的处分；对于昌平县人民法院，则应该通过这个事件来检查它的工作。
