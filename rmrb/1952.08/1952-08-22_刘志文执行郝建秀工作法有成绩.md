    Liu Zhiwen Achieves Success in Implementing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method
    Comrade Editor: Liu Zhiwen, a spinner at the Jin-Hua Textile Factory in Shanxi Province, conscientiously implements the Hao Jianxiu work method. Since the factory began promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method last October, her technical skills have gradually improved due to her active and diligent study. She increased the number of spindles she watched from 200 to 400. After the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign this year, Liu Zhiwen takes on the broken-down machines that others are unwilling to handle, yet the amount of roller cotton waste she produces is half that of others (averaging just over eight taels per shift). The main reason Liu Zhiwen has achieved such great success is that she has fully understood the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method, applying it flexibly to her own practical production, and transforming it into her own operational methods. For example, when the yarn on the bobbins is low and prone to breakage, she spends most of her time joining the broken ends. When there is more yarn on the bobbins and it is less prone to breakage, she does more cleaning work. If the roving on the roving bobbin is down to only three or four turns, she first does some cleaning work and then changes the bobbin, which prevents empty bobbins and saves time. Liu Zhiwen's experience has educated many workers, causing them to reverse their thinking that "the cotton quality is low, and the machines are difficult to operate, making it impossible to complete production tasks." After learning Liu Zhiwen's operating method, worker Luo Erzhi reduced her cotton waste by four taels compared to before.　Wu Jianping

    刘志文执行郝建秀工作法有成绩
    编辑同志：山西晋华纺织厂细纱挡车工刘志文，认真执行郝建秀工作法。去年十月该厂开始推广郝建秀工作法后，由于她积极努力学习，技术水平逐渐提高，从看二百个锭子增到看四百个锭子。今年增产节约运动开展后，刘志文看别人不愿看的坏车，但她的皮辊花却比别人少出一半（平均每班八两多）。刘志文所以有这样大的成绩，主要是她完全领会了郝建秀工作法的基本精神，灵活地运用到自己的实际生产中去，变为自己的操作方法。如当纱管上的纱少容易断头时，她便把大部时间放在接头上，当纱管上的纱多了不易断头时，她便多做些清洁工作。如遇粗纱管上的粗纱只留下三、四圈时，他就先做些清洁工作，然后再换，便可防止空管，又节省时间。刘志文的经验教育了许多职工，使他们扭转了“棉花质量低，车不好开不能完成生产任务”的思想。工人罗二枝学习了刘志文的操作法后，回花较前减少了四两。　武建平
