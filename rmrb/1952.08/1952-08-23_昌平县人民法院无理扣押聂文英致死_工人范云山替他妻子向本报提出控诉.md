    Changping County People's Court Illegally Detained Nie Wenying, Leading to Death
    Worker Fan Yunshan Accuses on Behalf of His Wife to This Newspaper
    Editor's Note: In mid-June, we received a letter from worker Fan Yunshan accusing the Changping County People's Court of illegally detaining his wife, Nie Wenying, leading to her death. We immediately forwarded it to the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate to investigate and handle the case. After investigation by personnel from the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate and the Hebei Provincial Public Security Department, it has been proven that the facts stated in the reader's letter are completely true. The Hebei Provincial People's Government should seriously handle this incident and announce it in the newspaper. Below is worker Fan Yunshan's letter.
    Comrade Editor: I want to accuse the Changping County People's Court of serious bureaucratism and illegal behavior. The Changping County People's Court, without any reason, said that my wife, Nie Wenying, was "suspected of murder," arrested her, and detained her for more than five months, neither stepping up interrogation nor allowing bail. It was not until Nie Wenying's condition in prison became critical that the court allowed bail. As a result, she died unjustly four days later. I am now telling you the course of this event, hoping that you will assist in handling it.
    On the afternoon of December 17th last year, Tian Mingyou's one-year-old daughter, Tian Ruyi, who lived in the same courtyard as us, suddenly died while sleeping on the kang (platform bed). The child had wounds on her neck and bloodstains under her pillow. The Tian family immediately reported it to the local railway public security police station. The Changping County People's Court and the police station sent people to investigate. Their investigation was perfunctory and they did not conduct an in-depth investigation. They said that only our family lived in the same courtyard, and we lived in the outer wing. Tian Ruyi's mother, Tian Fengshi, had gone out not long before, so outsiders would not have entered. Even if someone had entered, my wife should have heard it at the time. They also said that I usually liked Tian Ruyi very much, and my wife, Nie Wenying, might have been "jealous." Based on these "reasons," the court said that my wife was "suspected of murder" and arrested her on December 21st.
    Comrade Editor: I responsibly declare that the Changping County People's Court's reasons for arresting my wife are unfounded and extremely absurd. My family and Tian Mingyou's family had not moved together for long, and everyone got along very well. There was no hatred at all, and there was no such thing as "jealousy." My wife is already the mother of five children. Why would she kill Tian's child for no reason? My house's windowsill is very high. When Tian Fengshi went out, my wife was lying on the kang breastfeeding the child. It was impossible to see if someone came in. The court sent people to investigate for a long time. Didn't they understand these situations? In short, this case has nothing to do with my wife. Even Tian Fengshi has never suspected that my wife would kill her child! The Changping County People's Court did not properly understand the situation from the masses, and did not even solicit the opinions of the deceased's family members. They subjectively and mistakenly put the label of "suspected of murder" on my wife and arrested her. Comrade Editor: Is it tolerable that the People's Court still has such serious bureaucratic work style?
    My wife was arrested, leaving behind five children, the oldest thirteen years old and the youngest only three months old. The children were separated from their mother, and no one took care of them. They cried all day long. I had to go to work in the factory during the day, and when I came home and saw this situation, I was in extreme pain. Thanks to Tian Fengshi, she helped me take care of the children when she had time. I had no choice but to ask the union chairman to take the union's guarantee letter and go to the court with me, requesting that my wife be temporarily released on bail, and that she would be available for interrogation when summoned. The court did not allow it. I had to wait for the court to investigate and interrogate this case. But I waited and waited, and there was no further news. It was not until May 17th of this year that I heard that my wife was very ill in prison, so I asked Aunt Yuan, a county people's representative, to personally go to the court to bail my wife out for treatment. The court still said no. On May 24th, the court notified our union to bail my wife out. When the union bailed her out, her condition was already very critical and could not be treated. Four days later, she died unjustly. Acquaintances all said she died unjustly, and even the victim's mother, Tian Fengshi, cried for her injustice!
    Comrade Editor: I am sad, and I am even more angry. I want to accuse those bureaucratic elements. It was they who forced my wife to death, leaving my five children without a mother. I ask you to support me, severely punish these bureaucratic elements, and make this incident reasonably resolved.

    昌平县人民法院无理扣押聂文英致死
    工人范云山替他妻子向本报提出控诉
    编者按：六月中旬我们收到工人范云山控诉昌平县人民法院无理扣押其妻聂文英致死的来信，当即转请河北省人民检察署检查处理这一案件。现经河北省人民检察署和河北省公安厅派人到当地调查，证明读者来信所述事实完全属实。河北省人民政府应认真处理这一事件并在报上公布。下面是工人范云山的来信。
    编辑同志：我要对昌平县人民法院严重的官僚主义和非法行为提出控诉。昌平县人民法院毫无理由地说我妻子聂文英有“杀人嫌疑”，予以逮捕，扣押了五个多月，既不抓紧审讯，又不准取保外出。直到聂文英在狱中病情危急，法院才让取保出来。结果，四天后她就含冤死去了。我现在把这个事件的经过告诉你们，希望你们协助处理。
    去年十二月十七日下午，和我住在同院的田明友的一周岁的女儿田如意睡在炕上突然死了，孩子的脖子上有伤口，枕下有血迹。田家当即向当地铁路公安派出所报告，昌平县人民法院和派出所就派人来检验。他们检验得很潦草，也不深入调查，就说，同院只有我们一家，还住在外厢，田如意的母亲田冯氏出去不久，外人不会进来，即使有人进来，我妻当时在家也应该听到。又说，我平日很喜欢田如意，我妻聂文英可能“吃醋”。法院就根据这些“理由”，说我妻子有“杀人嫌疑”，在十二月二十一日把她逮捕了。
    编辑同志：我负责地声明：昌平县人民法院逮捕我妻子的理由是毫无根据而极其荒谬的。我家和田明友家搬在一起还不久，大家处得很融洽，根本没有什么仇恨，也说不上什么“吃醋”。我妻子已经是五个孩子的母亲了，为什么要无缘无故地杀死田家的孩子？我家窗台很高，田冯氏出外时我妻子正躺在炕上喂孩子奶，有人进来根本是看不到的。法院派人调查了好久，难道就不了解这些情况？总之，这个案件和我妻子无关，就是田冯氏也从来没有怀疑过我妻子会杀害她的孩子！昌平县人民法院不好好向群众了解情况，甚至也不征求死者家属的意见，就主观而错误地给我妻子扣上个“杀人嫌疑”的帽子，把她逮捕了。编辑同志：人民法院竟然还有这样严重的官僚主义作风，这是可以容忍的吗？
    我妻子被逮捕了，留下五个孩子，大的十三岁，小的才三个月。孩子们离开了母亲，没人照料，整天哭闹。我白天要到厂里工作，回家后看到这种情况，真是痛苦万分。感谢田冯氏，她有空时还帮我照顾孩子。我没法，就请工会主席拿了工会的保证书和我一起到法院去，要求把我妻暂时保出，审讯时随传随到。法院不许可。我只得等候着法院调查审讯这个案件。但左等右等，一直没有下文。直到今年五月十七日，我听说我妻在狱中病得很重，就请县人民代表袁大娘亲自到法院保我妻出来治疗。法院还是说不行。五月二十四日，法院通知我们工会去保我妻子。工会把她保出来时，她的病情已经十分危急，无法医治了。四天后，她就含冤死去了。熟人们都说她死的冤，连被害者的母亲田冯氏还为她哭屈！
    编辑同志：我伤心，我更愤恨。我要控诉那些官僚主义分子，是他们，把我妻子活活逼死，使我五个孩子失去了母亲。我要求你们支持我，严惩这些官僚主义分子，使这个事件得到合理解决。
