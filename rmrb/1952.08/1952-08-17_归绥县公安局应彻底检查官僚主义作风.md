The Public Security Bureau of Guisui County Should Thoroughly Examine Bureaucratic Work Styles

To the Editor: I am a staff member of the Second Branch Bureau of the Guisui Municipal Public Security Bureau. After the Zhang Shunyou incident was made public, we launched a struggle against bureaucracy, from which we received a profound education. However, the Public Security Bureau of Guisui County and the Fourth District People's Government of the county still have serious bureaucratic work styles.

The situation is as follows. Wang Gaigai, a woman from Xiaoxi Street in Guisui City, reported her husband, the counter-revolutionary murderer Li Hai, to the Xiaoxi Street Police Station of our Second Branch Bureau of the Guisui Municipal Public Security Bureau in February of this year. After liberation, the criminal Li fled to Quansheng Shop in Baotou City and changed his name to Wang Weiwei. The criminal's original residence was in Guisui County, and the crime scene was in Guisui County. Therefore, on February 12th, our bureau sent cadre Yin Zhaolin to submit the relevant materials about the criminal to the Guisui County Public Security Bureau for investigation and handling. Unexpectedly, the County Public Security Bureau neglected this case. During the "Three-Anti" movement, Yin Zhaolin went to the bureau three times to urge them to quickly handle the case. Section Chief Lian of the bureau said, "We are busy with the 'Three-Anti' movement and cannot spare time for the arrest." On March 2nd, the Guisui Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a written reminder to the County Public Security Bureau, but there was still no result. After the Zhang Shunyou incident was made public, in early June, cadre Li Shengrong from our bureau went to the County Public Security Bureau to urge them to handle the case. When Section Chief Jin of the County Public Security Bureau looked through the relevant materials, although the materials were marked "arrest," the counter-revolutionary criminal Li Hai had not actually been arrested, and the photos we sent were also lost. Li Shengrong told them that this case was very important and asked them to handle it quickly. However, after more than 20 days, there was still no progress. In order to arrest the counter-revolutionary criminal as soon as possible and meet the demands of the masses, we re-verified the materials about the criminal Li and urged the County Public Security Bureau to handle it quickly again. On June 27th, Song Yaoqing from the Guisui Municipal Public Security Bureau and I handed over the materials we had re-collected and verified to the County Public Security Bureau. It was not until July 7th that our bureau received the notice from the County Public Security Bureau that they had arrested the criminal Li.

The above facts show that the Public Security Bureau of Guisui County, the Fourth District People's Government of Guisui County, and other units still have serious bureaucratic work styles. I hope they can thoroughly examine them.

### 归绥县公安局应彻底检查官僚主义作风

    归绥县公安局应彻底检查官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：我是归绥市公安局第二分局的一个工作人员。张顺有事件公布后，我们展开了反官僚主义的斗争，从中受到了深刻的教育。但归绥县公安局和该县第四区人民政府至今仍然存在着严重的官僚主义作风。
    情况是这样的。归绥市小西街妇女王改改，在今年二月间向我们归绥市公安局第二分局小西街派出所检举了她的丈夫——反革命杀人犯李海。解放后李犯逃匿在包头市全胜店内，改名王维维。该犯原籍是归绥县，犯罪地点在归绥县，因此，我局就在二月十二日派干部尹兆林把该犯有关材料送交归绥县公安局调查处理。不想该县公安局对此案竟积压不理。“三反”运动期间，尹兆林曾经三次到该局催促迅速处理此案。该局连股长却说：“现在正在闹‘三反’，顾不上扣捕。”三月二日，归绥市公安局又向该县公安局书面催办，仍然没有结果。张顺有事件公布后，六月初，我局干部李生荣又去该县公安局催办，该县公安局靳股长翻出有关材料来看时，材料上面虽然批着“扣捕”，但实际却没有去扣捕反革命犯李海，而且把我们送去的有关像片也遗失了。李生荣向他们说，这案件很重要，请他们赶快处理。但过了二十多天，仍不见处理。我们为了早日扣捕反革命犯，满足群众要求，又重新把李犯的材料对证了一下，再次催该县公安局迅速处理。六月二十七日，我和归绥市公安局宋耀清又把我们重新搜集和对证的材料交给该县公安局。直到七月七日，我局才接到该县公安局扣捕李犯的通知。
    以上事实可以说明，归绥县公安局、归绥县第四区人民政府等单位仍然有严重的官僚主义作风。希望他们能彻底检查。    武兴周
