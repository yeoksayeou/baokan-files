    Correct the Bad Practice of Making False Reports

    The work reports made by lower-level organs to higher-level organs are an important basis for leading organs to formulate policies and work plans. Therefore, a basic condition for a work report is that it be truthful. However, some organs' work reports are untrue and false. This situation has been discovered constantly in the past and present. The news published in this newspaper today exposes the serious phenomenon of many units making false reports, which must arouse our high vigilance.

    There are three main reasons why this bad practice of making false reports is frequently discovered.

    The first reason is that some staff members have a rough and careless work style, hearing things second-hand and reporting them randomly. For example, when Hegang City, Songjiang Province, reported the agricultural production volume of the Yang Haishan team to higher authorities, they had neither measured the land nor weighed the products. The basic figures were all based on the reports of a few labor models and cadres, without review by the village government or discussion by the masses. From April 21st to 24th this year, the area of pest infestation reported by various districts in Lingling County, Hunan Province, increased from 2,700 mu to 330,000 mu. However, by April 26th, the districts reported that it had been "basically eliminated." After investigation, it was proved that these situations were all based on hearsay. The actual disaster situation was not that serious; but it was reported from the district to the county, and then to the special commissioner's office, and no one in the middle seriously conducted an investigation.

    The second reason is that the ideological consciousness of leaders in some places is impure, and they attempt to steal honors with false reports. For example, Xi Neng'an, the former director of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Branch Bureau, unscrupulously "cultivated" Li Yonglu into a "special-class meritorious worker" for personal purposes, falsely reporting his safe driving mileage and new fuel-saving records. Some comrades also often falsely report achievements and deliberately "manufacture" labor models in order to use "typical examples" to promote work. For example, Xu Laomo from Beipengjia Village, Jin County, Hebei Province, produced more than 300 catties of cotton per mu, but the county reported it as 500 catties. When Xu Laomo attended the Hebei Provincial Congress of Representatives of Industrial and Agricultural Labor Models last November, he told the truth, but Wen Guanghua, the head of the county's agricultural science section, even said to him: "What guiding role can you play by saying that?" The third reason is that some organs have a bureaucratic work style, failing to take effective measures to understand the situation and concretely solve problems in their work, but simply urging lower levels for reports and demanding figures. For example, the Propaganda Department of the Cang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province issued 11 types of forms in seven days during the drought prevention and drought resistance campaign, many of the statistics required were useless. This phenomenon of printing and issuing large numbers of forms is also widespread in other provinces. The leaders of some regions get carried away and issue forms and demand reports without considering the actual difficulties of the cadres below and whether it is possible to complete so many tasks. This forces many district and village cadres to spend all day filling out forms or writing reports. And some forms and reports have extremely tight deadlines, or are simply impossible for district and village cadres to fill out. Some district and village cadres with dishonest attitudes simply put together some numbers and report them. Or they roughly "estimate" it and report it upwards. For example, when the Hebei Provincial Department of Health asked counties for the number of rats and flies caught, Hejian County reported "17,690 fleas caught." Who would believe such figures? What use are they to the leading organs?

    This bad practice of making false reports has already caused great harm to our work. If it is not thoroughly corrected, it will inevitably cause many unnecessary difficulties to our country's upcoming large-scale economic construction and delay the progress of the country's economic construction. Because if the higher-level leading organs lightly believe false reports, use them to judge the situation, formulate plans, decide on policies, and guide work, the results are not difficult to imagine. Therefore, we should educate every staff member to fully recognize the harm of false reports and resolutely eliminate this bad practice. Those who repeatedly offend and do not change should be given severe criticism and even punishment.

### 纠正作假报告的恶劣作风

    纠正作假报告的恶劣作风
    下级机关向上级机关所作的工作报告，是领导机关制订政策和工作计划的重要依据。因此，工作报告的一个起码条件，就是真实。但是，有一些机关所作的工作报告却是不真实的，假的。这种情形，过去和现在都不断发现。今天本报发表的消息，揭露了许多单位做假报告的严重现象，这是必须引起我们的高度警惕的。
    这种作假报告的恶劣作风所以时有发现，主要有三个原因。
    第一个原因是有些工作人员有粗枝大叶的作风，道听途说，随便乱报。如松江省鹤岗市在向上级报告杨海山小组的农业生产量时，既没有丈量过土地，也没有秤过产品，基本数字都是根据几个劳动模范和干部的汇报得来的，没有经过村政府审查，更没有经过群众的讨论。从今年四月二十一日到二十四日，湖南省零陵县各区所汇报的虫害面积，从两千七百亩增到三十三万亩。但到四月二十六日，各区又汇报已“基本消灭”。后经调查，证明这些情况都是道听途说得来的。实际的灾情并没有那样严重；但却由区报告到县，又报到专署，中间没有一个人认真地作过调查。
    第二个原因，是有些地方的领导人思想意识不纯，企图用假报告来窃取荣誉。如前北京铁路分局丰台机务段段长奚能安为了个人的目的，不择手段地把李永禄“培养”成“特等功臣”，替他虚报安全走行公里和省油的新纪录。还有些同志为了利用“典型”来推动工作，也常常虚报成绩，故意“制造”劳动模范。如河北省晋县北彭家庄许老墨每亩产棉三百多斤，该县报告为五百斤。去年十一月许老墨出席河北省工农业劳动模范代表大会时说了实话，该县农业科长文光华还对他说：“你这样说，还起什么指导作用呢？”第三个原因，是有些机关存在着官僚主义的作风，不采取有效的办法了解情况，具体解决工作中的问题，而是单纯地向下级催报告、要数字。如中共河北省沧县县委宣传部在防旱抗旱运动期间，七天就发了十一种表格，其中所要统计的数字很多是无用的。这种大量印发表格的现象，在其他省份也普遍存在。有的地区的领导人脑子一热，就往下发表格，要报告，而不顾及下面干部的实际困难和是否有可能完成那样多的任务。这就使许多区、村干部不得不终日为填表格或写报告而忙个不停。而有些表格和报告限的时间又十分紧迫，或者根本不是区、村干部所能填写的，有些态度不老实的区、村干部，便随便凑个数字上报。或者大致“估”一下，就往上报。如河北省卫生厅向各县要捕鼠灭蝇的数字，河间县便报告“捉跳蚤一万七千六百九十个”。试问有谁相信这样的数字呢？它对于领导机关又有什么用处呢？
    这种做假报告的恶劣作风，已经给了我们的工作以极大危害，如果不彻底纠正，则势必给我们国家即将开始的大规模经济建设造成许多不应有的困难，延缓国家经济建设事业的前进速度。因为上级领导机关万一轻信了假报告，拿了它去判断情况，编制计划，决定政策，指导工作，其结果是不难设想的。因此我们应该教育每一个工作人员，充分认识假报告的危害性，坚决肃清这种恶劣作风。有屡犯不改者，应该给以严厉的批评以至处分。
