    Xinhua News Agency, 4th: A special correspondent for the French newspaper "L'Humanité" reported from Kaesong on the 3rd: Chief Delegate of the Korean-Chinese delegation, General Nam Il, told the US Chief Negotiating Delegate, Harrison, today that the Korean armistice is now within reach. However, as soon as the formal meeting of the two delegations resumed, Harrison immediately insisted on another week-long recess. This action by the US side is pushing the negotiations further towards failure and also proves that their intention is to gradually cancel the negotiations and expand the war.
    
    During the recess last week, there was more and more evidence of this kind: they carried out provocative bombings on the Chinese Northeast border; sent planes to invade China; and murdered prisoners of war. Yesterday, they fired artillery shells near the conference tent, and many shrapnel shells landed in areas that the US had agreed to keep neutral. They disregarded the neutrality agreement and are now sending more planes to fly low over Kaesong, which is clearly a demonstration to the Korean-Chinese side that they are no longer interested in a peaceful solution.
    
    In order to keep the negotiations going, General Nam Il debated with the US side, but the US refused to engage in any discussion. General Nam Il said to the US: Sit down honestly and negotiate in the spirit of reason. He said: This is the only way to solve the problem, and unreasonable recesses will not lead to any results. Time will eventually prove this to the Americans and the world. However, Harrison did not come to negotiate; he made no secret of the fact that his task was to interrupt the negotiations once again. As soon as he walked into the tent, he said, "I have nothing to say." Nam Il said that this proved that they had no sincerity in negotiating. Nam Il also pointed out that the only obstacle to the armistice remains the US insistence on violating the terms of the Geneva Convention and even violating the draft armistice agreement that they themselves had previously drawn up. Nam Il asked the US side if they dared to publish the minutes of the administrative meetings and condemned Harrison's absence from the meeting to cover up "the cowardly and barbaric act of massacring prisoners of war." Nam Il once again put forward the Korean-Chinese side's compromise plan: The US should correct the prisoner list to bring it closer to the realistic figure of 116,000, including 20,000 Chinese prisoners. Harrison replied like a hooligan: Nam Il's words were the words of a "criminal," and unless the Korean-Chinese side had "something worth listening to," he would not hold a meeting for another week.
    
    The US tactics have now been exposed very clearly. In the past, they interrupted the meeting for three days each time, and then held a meeting for a week. Now they interrupt the meeting for a week at a time, but the meeting only lasts for half an hour, and they don't say a word at the meeting. There is no doubt that they are preparing to recess for a longer period of time in this way, so that the negotiations will fail, but they will not have to accept the responsibility for directly interrupting the negotiations in the face of public opinion. The rainy season in Korea is coming to an end. The Americans' plan clearly contains the seeds of military adventure. They have always wanted to implement "military pressure" to force the Korean-Chinese side to accept an ultimatum, but after this ultimatum fails, they will continue to put forward new ultimatums. Although, as General Nam Il said, the armistice is within reach, the United States is making the armistice more and more distant day by day.

### 法国“人道报”特派记者  揭露美方拖延谈判和扩大战争的新阴谋

    揭露美方拖延谈判和扩大战争的新阴谋
    【新华社四日讯】法国“人道报”特派记者三日自开城报道：朝中代表团首席代表南日将军今天向美方首席谈判代表哈利逊说：朝鲜停战现在已垂手可得。可是双方代表团正式会议刚刚复会，哈利逊就立刻再度坚持再休会一个星期。美方的这种行径把谈判进一步推向失败，而且也证明了他们的企图是逐渐取消谈判和扩大战争。
    在上星期休会期间，这一类的证据是更加多了：他们又在中国东北边境上进行挑衅轰炸；派飞机侵入中国；又杀害战俘。昨天，他们向会议帐篷附近发射炮弹，许多榴霰弹落在美方曾经同意保持中立的地区。他们把中立协议不放在眼里，现在派出更多的飞机在开城上空低飞，这显然是向朝中方面表示他们对和平解决已经不感兴趣了。
    南日将军为了使谈判能够继续举行，曾和美方辩论，但是美国却拒绝进行任何讨论。南日将军向美方说：老老实实地坐下来根据说理的精神进行谈判。他说：这是解决问题的唯一办法，无理的休会是不会有结果的，时间最后会向美国人和全世界证明这一点。然而哈利逊并不是来谈判的，他一点也不想掩饰他的任务完完全全是来再一次使谈判中断。他一走进帐篷就说：“我没话可说。”南日说，这证明了他们没有诚意谈判。南日并指出：停战的唯一障碍仍然是美方坚持破坏日内瓦公约的条款，乃至违反他们自己先前所拟定的停战协定草案。南日问美方敢不敢公布行政性会议的纪录，并谴责哈利逊逃会是为了掩盖“屠杀战俘的卑怯野蛮的行为”。南日再次提出朝中方面的折衷方案：美方应校正俘虏名单，使之接近于十一万六千的符合实际的数字，其中包括两万中国俘虏在内。哈利逊像流氓一样的回答说：南日用的话是“罪犯”的话，除非朝中方面有“值得一听的话可说”，不然他就要再一个星期不开会。
    美方的一套手段到这里就暴露得很清楚了。以前他们是每次中断会议三天，然后开会一个星期。现在他们一中断会议就是一个星期，而开会却只有半小时，而且会上一句话不说。没有疑问，他们是准备这样更长时期地休会下去，好使谈判失败而自己又不致在舆论面前接受直接中断谈判的责任。朝鲜的雨季快要结束了。在美国人的计划里，显然包藏着军事冒险的祸心。他们一向是要施行“军事压力”，以迫使朝中方面接受最后通牒，但，在这种最后通牒失败之后，他们又会层出不穷地提出新的最后通牒。虽然，正如南日将军所说，停战已垂手可得，但美国却在一天天把停战推迟得更加遥远。
