This Year's National Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement Situation in the First Half of the Year
Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural Administration Department

This year, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has greatly developed across the country in the first half of the year. There are more than six million mutual aid teams nationwide; there are more than three thousand agricultural production cooperatives; the number of peasant households organized nationwide is more than thirty-five million, accounting for about 40% of the total number of peasant households in the country.

The quality of mutual aid and cooperative organizations has also significantly improved this year. Because leaders at all levels learned from the lessons of previous years, they rectified the mutual aid teams during the gaps between spring plowing and summer hoeing, and resolved issues related to strengthening the leadership of mutual aid teams, equivalent exchange and mutual benefit, and production plans. Therefore, in the summer production season, most mutual aid teams not only did not collapse but even developed in some areas. The proportion of long-term mutual aid teams nationwide increased from 10% in 1951 to 20% this year. The increase in long-term mutual aid teams and the decrease in temporary mutual aid teams is the first characteristic of this year's cooperative mutual aid movement.

The trial operation of agricultural production cooperatives in various places has had a positive impact on the masses. Therefore, in areas with a mutual aid foundation and well-run agricultural production cooperatives, farmers in mutual aid teams universally demand to be transformed into agricultural production cooperatives. In Northeast and North China, many mutual aid teams are merging small groups into large groups, transforming temporary groups into year-round groups, accumulating public property, and purchasing large livestock and farm tools to enrich the content of establishing cooperatives and increase the factors for establishing cooperatives. With the development of agricultural production cooperatives, the cooperative mutual aid movement will present a new face. This is the second characteristic of this year's cooperative mutual aid movement.

Due to the large-scale development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, great achievements have been made this year in drought prevention and resistance, spring plowing and sowing, and the patriotic production increase campaign.

First, organized farmers have played a leading role in the patriotic production increase campaign. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than one million mutual aid teams (cooperatives) participating in the patriotic production increase campaign nationwide. In many areas, the challenge competitions of mutual aid teams have driven the upsurge of competition among the broad masses of farmers. Members of mutual aid teams, with high enthusiasm, learned high-yield experiences, improved farming techniques, basically overcame the difficulties in agricultural farming techniques, and played a huge role in completing the production increase competition plan.

Second, great achievements have been made in spring plowing, drought prevention, and the prevention and control of pests and diseases:
(1) This year, 1.66 million small-scale canals, culverts, sluice gates, ponds, dams, and dikes have been built and renovated nationwide, and 405,000 brick wells have been dug, expanding the irrigated area by a total of 22.9 million mu, more than double the area of paddy fields expanded in 1951. The vast majority of these water conservancy projects were built cooperatively by organized groups.
(2) Due to the improved work efficiency from being organized, timely completion of spring plowing and sowing was ensured. The spring plowing and sowing work in the entire Northwest region was completed an average of one week ahead of schedule. In Tongliao and Kairu counties in Inner Mongolia, mutual aid teams sowed large fields half a month earlier than in previous years. In Liling County, Hunan Province, rice transplanting was completed five days earlier than last year, saving more than 46,000 workdays and 430 million yuan.
(3) Since the beginning of spring, wheat aphids, locusts, cotton aphids, and other pests and diseases have infested a wide area nationwide. Because the masses in various places have been organized, the pests have been basically eliminated. In the two provinces of Rehe and Liaodong, more than 510,000 people were organized to divide the insect control area to carry out the struggle to prevent and eliminate insects. In the work of controlling cotton aphids, some counties in Hebei Province generally organized the masses to collectively prepare medicines and mutually help with pest control, with great results.

Third, in the newly liberated areas where land reform has just been completed, farmers have organized to solve the difficulties of new turn-over households lacking draught animals, farm tools, and food, ensuring the smooth progress of the production increase campaign. In Ligang Township, Huangchuan County, Henan Province, many poor peasants and hired laborers lacked draught animals and farm tools. Because they organized to exchange labor between people and cattle, they not only planted the land in time but also jointly purchased a waterwheel. In Zhuangziping Township, Gaolan County, Gansu Province, mutual aid and mutual assistance were carried out within the mutual aid teams, with a total of 26 shi of grain and seeds lent out, solving the difficulties of poor households and ensuring timely sowing.

The CCP committees and people's governments at all levels have strengthened the specific leadership of the cooperative mutual aid movement, which is an important key to the rapid development of cooperative mutual aid organizations this year. The major administrative regions of North China, Northeast China, East China, Northwest China, and more than ten provinces including Hebei and Shandong, have all held one or several cooperative mutual aid work conferences this year, determining the guidelines and specific measures for developing cooperative mutual aid organizations. Most provinces and regions have appointed cadres specifically responsible for cooperative mutual aid work and established specialized management agencies. This has basically overcome the past tendency of "grabbing a handful in spring, loosening in summer, and not asking in autumn."

The main experiences in developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various places this year are as follows:

(1) Extensive propaganda and education on the new and old roads to the broad masses of farmers, so that party members, cadres, and farmers can improve their ideological understanding of organizing cooperative mutual aid, is the most basic driving force for carrying out the cooperative mutual aid movement. Last winter and this spring, various places conducted education on the new and old roads to labor models, mutual aid team leaders, and the masses through provincial and county labor model conferences, mutual aid team representative meetings, mutual aid team leader training classes, and other methods, so that party members and cadres and labor models in rural areas have a further understanding of the direction of rural economic development, and attached importance to leading the organization of the cooperative mutual aid movement.

(2) Carrying out the patriotic production increase competition campaign is one of the important methods to promote the consolidation and development of cooperative mutual aid organizations. Through competition, evaluation, and summarization, the superiority of being organized is further demonstrated, and many individual farmers are won over to participate in mutual aid teams. In Daming County, Hebei Province, more than 30,000 mutual aid teams were added during the summer competition and evaluation, and more than 1,400 temporary seasonal mutual aid teams were upgraded to year-round mutual aid teams.

(3) Convening mutual aid team representative meetings and mutual aid team backbone training classes is an indispensable link in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Mutual aid team leaders and activists who have participated in representative meetings or training classes in Shanxi, Liaoxi, Hunan, Ningxia, and other provinces have improved their ideological awareness and learned practical experience in organizing cooperative mutual aid, becoming the backbone of the cooperative mutual aid movement.

(4) The economic and technical assistance and preferential treatment given by the people's government to cooperative mutual aid organizations has further encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers to organize production. This year, the state issued more than 3 trillion yuan in agricultural loans, with mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives as the main lending targets; new agricultural tools, improved varieties, agricultural medicines, and machinery are also mainly promoted to mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The technical assistance of state-owned farms to mutual aid teams and production cooperatives is gradually being strengthened, and in some areas, state-owned banks and mutual aid teams and production cooperatives have begun to sign "credit contracts." Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also signed "integration contracts" with mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, which have greatly helped the development of cooperative mutual aid organizations.

Currently, there are several problems in the cooperative mutual aid movement that must be resolved.

(1) The phenomenon of unbalanced and ununiversal development of cooperative mutual aid organizations still exists. The situation where farmers are not organized is very common in the new areas, and quite serious in the old areas as well. For example, in Shaanxi Province, the organized labor force accounts for 50%, while in Zhidan, Hengshan, Jingbian, and other counties in the province, the organized labor force is less than 10%. In Shanxi Province, the organized labor force accounts for 75%, but in Gaoping County, 45% of the labor force has not participated in mutual aid teams. The reasons for this situation, in addition to the different working bases due to the early or late liberation of various regions, the most important is the leadership problem. In some rural areas that have implemented land reform, some cadres are only satisfied with the situation that farmers have land and their enthusiasm for production is high after land reform, and believe that "land reform requires leadership; production is done by the masses themselves, and leadership is not needed." They do not fully understand that the fundamental purpose of land reform is to improve and develop production. In addition, some cadres one-sidedly believe that "there are many tasks and the work is busy, and I can't take care of mutual aid work." Separating organizing and production work mechanically, or regarding them as contradictory, is obviously wrong. Therefore, this kind of thinking must be changed and the leadership method must be improved. Although cadres and farmers have gained a lot of experience in organizing after several years of cooperative mutual aid movement in the old areas, leaders in various places have not paid enough attention to how to strengthen the leadership of areas without mutual aid organizations and areas with weak mutual aid organizations. At the same time, in specific work, some cadres cannot correctly use the leadership methods of cultivating typical examples, drawing on experience, and promoting the overall situation, so that the points and the overall situation cannot be organically combined, and some neglect the promotion of the overall work because they focus on points. In addition, some cadres have incorrect ideas, believing that weak areas are difficult to lead, require a lot of effort, and cannot achieve results in a short period of time, so they are unwilling to work in areas without mutual aid organizations or areas with weak mutual aid organizations. Various localities must further strengthen the leadership of weak areas, conduct in-depth and specific inspections and analysis of the reasons for the imbalance, and study and formulate effective methods to solve them.

(2) Due to the fact that some cadres have a purely task-oriented view, formalism and blindly pursuing advanced forms and numbers have emerged in many areas. Instead of patiently educating farmers, they adopted simple and rigid methods and threats and forced the masses to form groups. This approach has created a bad influence among the masses. The reasons for this deviation, in addition to the fact that the method of promoting general work through typical demonstrations cannot be well applied in the specific organization process, and the experience of organizing mutual aid in advanced areas is not absorbed, the main reason is that the long-term and arduous nature of transforming the small peasant economy is not deeply understood. Experience in various places has proved that as long as the principles are clearly explained and good examples are made, farmers will organize themselves after seeing the benefits of being organized. Therefore, it is necessary to seriously correct the deviation of formalism and coercion, strengthen cadres' theoretical study of the policies of cooperative mutual aid, and conscientiously do a good job in cultivating typical examples, so as to draw on experience and promote the normal development of the cooperative mutual aid movement.

(3) The composition of mutual aid teams in some areas is impure, which affects the consolidation of mutual aid teams. In the Fourth District of Pingluo County, Ningxia Province, there are 100 landlords in 92 mutual aid teams; in Mengzhai District of Wuyang County, Henan Province, there are more than 100 landlords, bullies, and controlled elements in 880 mutual aid teams. After these people joined the mutual aid teams, they seized leadership, sabotaged production, and carried out illegal exploitation. The cooperative mutual aid organization is a collective labor organization of working farmers based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. It enjoys various economic and political conveniences and priority rights granted by the state, and landlords and controlled lawbreakers cannot enjoy such rights. Therefore, impure cooperative mutual aid organizations must be rectified, and bad elements must be cleaned out after mass discussion.

(4) Some mutual aid teams and production cooperatives in some areas have not seriously implemented the basic principles of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit. Unreasonable regulations such as overly high or low ratios of labor and livestock wages, and overly high land dividends in some agricultural production cooperatives will reduce the labor enthusiasm of farmers and affect the consolidation of cooperative mutual aid organizations. Leaders in various places should pay attention to this and persuade the masses to correct it. Secondly, most of the current mutual aid teams have not yet established a system for evaluating and recording work. Some mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives treat women's labor as half labor or do not allow women in the community to enjoy the right to labor dividends, only giving them meager wages, etc., should also be corrected.

    今年上半年全国互助合作运动情况
    中央人民政府农业部农政司
    今年上半年全国各地互助合作运动有了很大的发展。全国共有互助组六百余万个；有农业生产合作社三千余个；全国组织起来的农户有三千五百余万户，约占全国总农户百分之四十左右。
    今年互助合作的组织，质量上也有显著提高。由于各级领导接受往年的教训，在春耕夏锄的空隙整顿了互助组，解决了有关巩固互助组的领导、等价两利、生产计划等问题，因此在夏季生产中大部分地区互助组不但没有垮台，而且有些发展。全国长期互助组一九五一年占百分之十，今年增加到百分之二十。长期互助组增加，临时互助组减少，这是今年合作互助运动中的第一个特点。
    各地农业生产合作社的试办，在群众中影响良好。因此有互助基础和农业生产合作社试办较好的地方，互助组的农民普遍要求改变成为农业生产合作社。东北、华北很多互助组将小组并成大组，临时组变成常年组，积累公有财产，购买大牲口大农具，以充实建社的内容，增加建社因素。随着农业生产合作社的发展，合作互助运动将会出现一种新的面貌，这是今年合作互助运动中的第二个特点。
    由于互助合作组织的大量发展，今年防旱抗旱春耕播种及开展爱国增产竞赛运动获得了很大成绩。
    第一、组织起来的农民，在爱国增产竞赛运动中起了带头作用。据不完全统计：全国参加爱国增产竞赛运动的互助组（社）共有一百余万个。不少地区由于互助组的挑战竞赛，带动了广大农民的竞赛热潮。互助组员并以高度的热情，学习了丰产经验，改进了耕作技术，基本上克服了农业耕作技术上的困难，对完成增产竞赛计划起了巨大的作用。
    第二、在春耕防旱及防治病虫害上获得了很大成绩：
    （一）今年全国兴修及整修小型渠道涵闸、塘坝圩堤等一百六十六万处，打砖井四十万五千眼，共扩大灌溉面积二千二百九十万亩，超过一九五一年扩大水田的二倍以上。这些水利工程，绝大多数是由于组织起来合作兴建的。
    （二）由于组织起来提高了工作效率，保证春耕播种及时完成。西北区全区春耕播种工作平均提前一周完成。内蒙通辽、开鲁两县互助组播种大田较往年提早半月。湖南省醴陵县插秧较去年提早五天完成，并省工四万六千余个，节约四亿三千万元。
    （三）入春以来，全国范围内麦蚜、蝗虫、棉蚜等病虫害为害面积很广，由于各地群众组织起来，虫害基本上已经消灭了。热河、辽东两省曾组织起来五十一万多群众，划分防虫区进行防虫灭虫的斗争。治棉蚜工作中，河北省有些县群众普遍组织起来，集体配药，互助除治，收效很大。
    第三、土地改革刚完成的新解放区，农民组织起来，解决了新翻身户缺乏耕畜农具和口粮的困难，保证了增产运动的顺利进行。河南省潢川县栗岗乡很多贫雇农缺乏耕畜和农具，由于组织起来人牛换工，不但及时种上地，并伙购了一架水车。甘肃省皋兰县庄子坪乡在互助组内开展互助互济，共借出粮食、籽种二十六石，解决了贫苦户的困难，保证了及时下种。
    中共各级党委和各级人民政府加强对合作互助运动的具体领导，是今年合作互助组织获得迅速发展的重要关键。华北、东北、华东、西北等大行政区及河北、山东等十余省，今年都开过一次或数次合作互助工作会议，确定了发展合作互助组织的方针及具体措施。多数省区都确定了专管合作互助工作的干部并设立了专管机构。基本上克服了过去“春天抓一把、夏松、秋不问”的偏向。
    今年各地发展互助合作组织的主要经验有下列各点：
    （一）广泛地向农民群众进行新旧两条道路的宣传教育，使党员干部和农民群众提高对组织合作互助的思想认识，是开展合作互助运动最基本的动力。去冬与今春各地通过省、县劳动模范会议、互助组代表会、互助组长训练班及其他方式向劳动模范、互助组长和群众进行新旧两条道路的教育，使农村中的党员和干部、劳动模范对于农村经济发展的方向，有了进一步的认识，重视了对组织合作互助运动的领导。
    （二）开展爱国主义增产竞赛运动，是促进合作互助组织巩固发展的重要方法之一。通过竞赛评比总结，更显示出组织起来的优越性，争取了很多个体农民参加互助组。河北大名县在夏季竞赛评比中增加了三万余个互助组，并有一千四百余个临时季节性互助组提高为常年互助组。
    （三）召开互助组代表会议和互助组骨干训练班，是领导互助合作运动不可缺少的一环。山西、辽西、湖南、宁夏等省凡是参加过代表会或训练班的互助组长和积极分子，都提高了思想觉悟，学到组织合作互助的实际经验，成为合作互助运动中的骨干。
    （四）人民政府经济上和技术上对合作互助组织的帮助优待，更鼓舞了农民组织起来生产的热情。今年国家发放农业贷款三万余亿元，以互助组和农业生产合作社为主要贷放对象；新式农具、优良品种、农用药械等也以互助合作组织为主要的推广对象。国营农场对互助组、生产合作社的技术帮助逐渐在加强，有些地区的国家银行和互助组、生产合作社开始订立“信贷合同”。各地供销合作社也和互助组、农业生产合作社订立“结合合同”，这些对于帮助合作互助组织的发展作用很大。
    目前合作互助运动中存在的几个问题，必须予以解决。
    （一）合作互助组织发展不平衡不普遍的现象依然存在，农民没有组织起来的情形在新区很多，在老区也相当严重。如陕西全省组织起来劳力达百分之五十，而该省的志丹、横山、靖边等县组织起来劳力还不足百分之十。山西全省组织起来劳力达百分之七十五，但高平县仍有百分之四十五的劳力没参加互助组。造成此种情况的原因，除各地区解放迟早工作基础不同外，最主要的是领导问题。在已经实行土地改革地区有些农村工作的干部，只满足于土地改革后农民有了土地生产情绪高涨的情形，认为“讲土地改革，非领导不行；讲生产，群众自己会，用不着领导”。不完全了解土地改革的根本目的就是为了提高与发展生产。此外，也有一些干部片面地认为“任务多工作忙，顾不上搞互助工作”。把组织起来与生产工作机械分开，或看成相互矛盾，显然是不对的。因此必须转变这种思想与改进领导方法。在老区虽然经过几年来互助合作运动的开展，干部和农民对于组织起来有了不少体验，但各地领导干部对于如何加强没有互助组织和互助组织薄弱地区的领导，注意和重视不够。同时在具体工作中，有些干部不能正确运用培养典型吸取经验推动全面的领导方法，致使点面不能有机结合，有的因为搞点而忽视了对全面工作的推动。另外有些干部存在不正确的想法，认为薄弱区不好领导，费力量大，一下搞不出成绩来，就不愿到没有互助组织或是互助组织薄弱地区工作。各地必须进一步加强对薄弱区的领导，深入具体地检查、分析不平衡的原因，并研究拟定出有效的办法予以解决。
    （二）由于某些干部存在着单纯任务观点，在不少地区产生了形式主义、盲目追求高级形式和数字的偏向。不去耐心教育农民，而采取简单生硬的办法和口号威胁与强迫群众编组。这种做法，在群众中造成不良的影响。产生此种偏向的原因，除在具体组织过程中不能很好地运用典型示范推动一般的工作方法、不吸取先进地区组织互助的经验外，主要的是由于没有深刻了解改造小农经济的长期性、艰苦性。各地经验证明，只要把道理讲清楚并做出好的样子，农民看到组织起来的好处后是会组织起来的。因此必须认真纠正形式主义与强迫命令的偏向，加强干部对合作互助政策的理论学习，并认真做好培养典型的工作，以便吸取经验推动合作互助运动正常发展。
    （三）某些地区互助组内成份不纯，影响了互助组的巩固。宁夏省平罗县四区九十二个互助组，其中有地主一百户；河南舞阳县孟砦区八百八十个互助组中，有地主恶霸和被管制分子一百余个。这些人参加互助组后，窃取领导权，破坏生产，进行非法剥削。合作互助组织是劳动农民本自愿两利原则的集体劳动组织，它享有国家所给予的经济上、政治上各项便利与优先权，而地主和被管制的不法分子是不能享受此种权利的。为此，对于不纯的合作互助组织必须予以整顿，使坏分子经过群众讨论后被清洗出去。
    （四）有些地区的互助组和生产合作社还没有认真地贯彻等价两利的基本原则。人畜工资比价过高过低；有的农业生产合作社土地分红过高等不合理的规定，会降低农民的劳动情绪和影响合作互助组织的巩固。各地领导对此应引起注意，说服群众改正。其次，目前多数的互助组仍未建立评工记工制度，有的互助组和农业生产合作社对于妇女劳动力一律以半劳力看待，或不让社内妇女享受劳动分红权利，只给其低微的工资等，亦应注意改正。
