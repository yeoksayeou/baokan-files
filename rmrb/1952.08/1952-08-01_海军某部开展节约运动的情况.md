The Navy Unit's Savings Campaign

Dear Chairman Mao: I want to report to you on the savings campaign that our unit has launched, under your and the Party's leadership, and on the basis of the "Three-Anti" Movement.

    We have focused on cherishing state and people's property, and caring for weapons, machinery, and instruments, and have universally established departmental savings pledges and individual savings plans. Every comrade has proposed: to improve professional skills, master operational methods; and to achieve savings requirements on the basis of not wasting a drop of oil, not damaging a tool or a screw for no reason. Our savings achievements have already been very significant. For example, thanks to the attention to saving by every comrade in the engine department, half of the gasoline can be saved each month. In the gunnery department, gun cleaning cloths used to be thrown into the sea when they were dirty; now it is different. Comrades are vying to wash the cloths that have been used to wipe the guns, wash them and use them again, use them again and wash them again, until they can no longer be used, and then they are handed over to the sail-making班 (ban - could be class/team/squad) to wipe steel cables. The phenomenon of departments damaging or losing things for no reason has rarely occurred. As for the phenomenon of waste in the lives of comrades, as soon as it occurs, it is immediately criticized on the wall newspaper or at the class meeting, and everyone understands the significance of cherishing the property of the motherland.

    Respected Chairman Mao: In order to rapidly strengthen the People's Navy and accelerate coastal defense construction, we must strengthen technical and cultural learning and launch a mass learning upsurge. I guarantee to study hard and practice diligently in the learning movement, strictly abide by all systems; what I understand, I must patiently teach to others, and what I do not understand, I must humbly learn from others; with mutual assistance, we will victoriously complete the task of learning culture and learning technology, so that we can become cultured naval fighters of the People's China.

    海军某部开展节约运动的情况
    亲爱的毛主席：我要向您报告的，是在您和党的领导下，在“三反”运动的基础上，我们单位开展节约运动的情况。
    我们以爱护国家人民财产，爱护武器、机器、仪器为中心，普遍地订立了部门节约公约及个人节约计划。每一个同志都提出：提高业务技术，精通操作方法；在不浪费一滴油、不无故损坏一件工具及一颗螺丝钉的基础上，实现节约的要求。我们节约的成绩已经很显著了。比如，由于轮机部门每一个同志都注意了节约，每月可以节省一半汽油。枪炮部门的擦炮布，以前是脏了就往海里扔；现在就不同了，擦过炮的布，同志们争着去洗，洗了再用，用了再洗，一直用到不能用了，才交到帆?班擦钢丝?用。各部门无故损坏或丢东西的现象已很少发生了。至于同志们在生活方面的浪费现象，只要发生了，马上就在墙报上或班务会上受到批评，大家都懂得了珍惜祖国财产的意义。
    敬爱的毛主席：为了迅速壮大人民海军，加紧海防建设，我们要加强技术、文化学习，掀起群众性的学习热潮。我保证在学习运动中苦学苦练，严格遵守一切制度；自己懂的，要耐心教给别人，自己不懂的，要虚心向人学习；在互相帮助下，胜利完成学习文化、学习技术的任务，使我们成为有教养的人民中国的海军战士。
    中国人民海军学习模范  李洪
