She also visited the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, the North Railway Station District Government, and residents of the neighborhood committees. Mrs. Felton was deeply impressed by the tremendous progress made in all aspects of Shanghai, as well as the prosperity of the Shanghai market and the increase in people's purchasing power. She told reporters: "Everywhere I go, people tell me: 'We are gradually building,' If such a rapid advancement is still called gradual construction, then I cannot understand what you mean by 'fast'." During her stay in Shanghai, Mrs. Felton also visited Soong Ching Ling, the initiator of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
