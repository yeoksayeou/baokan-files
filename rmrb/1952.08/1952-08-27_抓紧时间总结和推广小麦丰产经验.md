    Seize the Time to Summarize and Promote Wheat High-Yield Experiences
    The time for autumn wheat sowing is fast approaching. Agricultural leadership organs in various regions should seize the time to summarize and promote local experiences in wheat fertilization, plowing, seed selection, sowing, and pest and disease prevention; they should make the best use of local high-yield examples to overcome farmers' conservative thinking and concerns about increasing production. The wheat technology conference held by Shanxi Province not long ago, which summarized this year's wheat high-yield experiences and formulated next year's production increase plan, was very timely and necessary.
    This year, many new high-yield records have emerged in wheat production across the country. These experiences and achievements are extremely valuable; however, some experiences are immature, and the existing high-yield levels are still unstable. To stabilize them and continue to improve them, agricultural science and technology workers need to carry out a lot of arduous and meticulous work. It is necessary to carefully investigate and study the experiences of the masses, combine them with different specific conditions in various regions (such as climate, soil, agricultural tools, etc.), and analyze and synthesize them based on advanced agricultural scientific principles, so as to raise the rich experiences of the masses to a scientific level. This is a huge task, and agricultural departments and agricultural technicians should pay great attention to this work. Party organizations in various localities, leading cadres of governments at and below the special district level should also closely cooperate and vigorously assist. In particular, it is necessary to conduct thorough investigations, which are difficult to do well with only a few agricultural technicians without the assistance of local Party organizations and People's Governments.
    But this is by no means to say that we must wait until a complete set of very detailed and very scientific cultivation technology experience is summarized before it can be promoted. All experiences that have been confirmed, even if they are relatively small in scope, should be boldly confirmed and immediately promoted to the broad masses, so as to continue to absorb the experiences of the masses, transform and improve them; those that cannot be determined for the time being should also be actively tested to minimize the time of exploration. To date, many local leading cadres only report high-yield achievements to higher authorities, but do not pay attention to summarizing high-yield experiences; some only pay attention to summarizing the experiences of small-area high-yield production, but do not summarize the experiences of achieving high yields on larger areas. This situation must be changed.

### 抓紧时间总结和推广小麦丰产经验

    抓紧时间总结和推广小麦丰产经验
    秋季播种小麦的时间很快就要到来了。各地农业领导机关，应该抓紧时间，把当地关于小麦施肥、犁地、选种、播种、预防病虫害等方面的经验，加以总结和推广；尽量利用当地的丰产实例，克服农民的保守思想和增产顾虑。山西省在不久以前举行的小麦技术会议，总结了今年小麦丰产经验，制订了明年的增产计划，这是很适时很必要的。
    今年全国各地又出现了不少小麦丰产的新纪录。这些经验和成绩是极为宝贵的；但有些经验是不成熟的，现有的丰产水平也还是不稳定的。要稳定它，并继续提高它，就需要农业科学技术工作者进行许多艰苦的细致的工作。必须认真调查研究群众的经验，结合各地不同的具体条件（如气候、土壤、农具等），根据先进的农业科学原理，加以分析综合，把群众的丰富的经验提高到科学的水平。这是一个巨大的工作，农业部门和农业技术人员应该十分注意这个工作，各地方的党组织、专区以下的各级政府领导干部也要密切配合、大力协助。特别是进行周密的调查工作，如果没有各地党组织和人民政府的协助，只靠少数农业技术人员是很难做好的。
    但这绝不是说，必须要等到一整套十分细致十分科学的栽培技术经验总结出来之后，才能加以推广。凡是已经能够确定的经验，那怕是范围比较小的，都应该大胆地确定下来，并立即推广到广大群众中去，以便继续吸取群众的经验，加以改造和提高；暂时还不能确定的，也要积极进行试验，尽量缩短摸索的时间。至今还有很多地方的领导干部只是向上级报告丰产成绩，却没有注意总结丰产经验；有的只注意总结小面积高额丰产的经验，而没有总结在较大面积上获得丰产的经验。这种情况必须加以改变。
