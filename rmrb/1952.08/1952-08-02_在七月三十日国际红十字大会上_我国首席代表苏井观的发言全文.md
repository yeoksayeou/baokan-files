Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 1st: Su Jingguan, Chief Representative of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China attending the 18th International Red Cross Conference, delivered a speech at the General Committee meeting of the conference on July 30th, condemning the American intervention army for seriously violating the Geneva Conventions, massacring prisoners of war and civilians, and conducting bacteriological warfare. He also advocated taking measures to uphold the dignity of the Geneva Conventions. The full text of the speech is as follows: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: The Chinese delegation believes that discussing the implementation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions at this meeting is extremely timely and important, because less than a year after these conventions came into effect, a country 5,000 miles away in the territory of Korea launched a foreign intervention war in Korea. In this extremely cruel and inhumane war, which is still ongoing, the Geneva Conventions have been severely violated.

	First, the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of war and the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field have been completely destroyed.

	Ladies and Gentlemen: The authorities of the Busan and Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camps have used unprecedented terror and torture to abuse and massacre captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese forces. Prisoners of war are constantly in danger of being beaten to death by the guards of the prisoner-of-war camp, not to mention the humiliating acts of the prisoner-of-war camp authorities forcing prisoners of war to parade naked. They collectively massacred unarmed prisoners of war, and even the wounded and sick prisoners of war were not spared. All these crimes cannot be denied by anyone. Former US Army Brigadier General Colson, commander of the US military's prisoner-of-war camp, admitted to these inhumane treatments in a statement on May 10, 1952. It is also natural that the American and British news agencies call Geoje Island the "Island of Terror" in many dispatches. According to incomplete estimates, more than 7,700 prisoners of war died from such abuse and torture in 1951 alone. According to incomplete materials revealed by news reports from the Associated Press, United Press, Reuters and other news agencies, there were eleven incidents of massacres of prisoners of war in Busan and Geoje Island in the short period from February to early July of this year. A total of more than 600 prisoners of war were killed or injured, an average of 100 per month. As a result, Article 12 of the Geneva Convention concerning the sick and wounded and the basic provisions concerning respect for human life and humane treatment of prisoners of war have been completely destroyed.

	In addition, foreign interventionists openly disregard Article 118 of the Geneva Convention regarding prisoners of war, which clearly stipulates that prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of actual hostilities. They also disregard Article 7 of the same Convention, which stipulates that prisoners of war may not under circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention. In Korean armistice negotiations, foreign interventionists put forward an absurd proposal in the name of "voluntary repatriation", which in practice was intended to deprive 100,000 prisoners of war of their right to repatriation and detain them. Because these humanitarian provisions of the Geneva Convention for the Protection of Prisoners of War were violated in the Korean armistice negotiations by one of the two opposing parties, a signatory to the Geneva Convention, the armistice negotiations, which lasted for a year, have not yet succeeded, and tens of thousands of captured personnel on both sides have not yet been able to return home and reunite with their families.

	Article 17 of the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War stipulates that no physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Article 26 of the same Convention stipulates that collective punishment for infractions of discipline shall be prohibited. However, the prisoner-of-war camp authorities violently violated the above provisions and used coercion, torture and starvation to conduct so-called "screening" of prisoners of war. They also assigned agents working for two puppet regimes to hold responsible positions in most prisoner-of-war camps and forcibly tattooed prisoners of war with words slandering their motherland. In addition, they fabricated protests written in blood in the name of prisoners of war to express their so-called determination to refuse repatriation. Prisoners of war who were unwilling to do so were severely beaten by these agents. After the prisoners of war were seriously injured or fainted, the agents took advantage of this opportunity to tattoo them, or when the prisoners of war lost consciousness, they held their fingers and used the blood from their wounds to put fingerprints on the so-called "screening" documents, forging their determination of "unwillingness to return home". These agents even dipped their own fingers in the blood from the wounds of the prisoners of war who had been beaten unconscious to forge fingerprints. Countless prisoners of war have been deprived of rations, brutally beaten or even tortured to death for refusing forced "screening".

	Second, the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War has also been unscrupulously violated. In northern Korea, which was once occupied by foreign interventionist forces, there have been countless cases of illegal arrest and imprisonment, abuse and torture of civilians, as well as countless cases of rape of women and massacres of civilians without cause or trial - including many women, children, and even infants. As a result, foreign interventionist forces have violated Articles 27, 32 and 68 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, and Article 46 of the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land in the 1907 Hague Convention regarding the protection of the lives of civilians by occupying powers.

	Foreign interventionist forces also indiscriminately bombed undefended cities and villages far from the front line, and repeatedly used the most inhumane napalm bombs. They also systematically bombed by air or destroyed non-military, undefended buildings such as churches, artistic and scientific buildings, historical relics and hospitals before withdrawing. All these acts violate the laws and customs of war, in particular Articles 18 and 53 of the aforementioned Geneva Convention, and Articles 27, 55 and 56 of the aforementioned Hague Convention.

	In addition, foreign interventionist forces have used the most barbarous means of war that even the Hitler bandit gang did not dare to use, namely, spreading artificially infected insects in northern Korea and northeast China to spread disease and death. This appalling act not only violates the universally recognized law prohibiting bacteriological warfare as reiterated in the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land in the 1907 Hague Convention and the 1925 Geneva Protocol, but is also a heinous crime that violates the basic spirit of the Geneva Convention and the humanitarian spirit of the Red Cross.

	Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: All people in the world who advocate humanity and love peace cannot but feel extreme shock and extreme indignation at such brutal acts that violate the Geneva Conventions. The fundamental purpose of this conference is to uphold humanity and peace. If it fails to solemnly declare its firm opposition to such atrocities and acts that violate the conventions, the moral standing and prestige of this conference in the eyes of the people of the world will suffer a fatal blow, and the appalling suffering suffered by Korean civilians and captured personnel of Korea and China today will fall on the heads of anyone who may become a prisoner of war in any other country tomorrow. Even more, if no measures are taken to stop such acts that violate the conventions, the noble cause of humanity and peace will henceforth be submerged in the bloodbath of barbarous atrocities.

	In view of the above reasons, the Chinese delegation proposes that the conference adopt the following resolution in order to safeguard the dignity of the Geneva Conventions:

	"The 18th International Red Cross Conference notes the cruel abuse and massacres of prisoners of war in the Busan and Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camps in Korea, who were forced to undergo so-called 'screening' and deprived of their right to be repatriated;

	The Conference further notes the indiscriminate bombing of undefended cities and villages in northern Korea, the massacres of peaceful residents, and the wanton destruction of religious, cultural and charitable institutions;

	The Conference considers that the above-mentioned acts in Korea seriously violate the three 1949 Geneva Conventions, namely the 'Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War', the 'Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field' and the 'Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'.

	Therefore, the Conference condemns such acts that seriously violate the Geneva Conventions and violate the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross;

	The Conference calls on the Red Cross Societies of all countries to work together to mobilize world opinion to demand an immediate cessation of all atrocities in Korea that violate the Geneva Conventions, so that the supreme dignity of the Conventions may be maintained."

	The Chinese delegation earnestly requests that all conscientious representatives of governments and Red Cross Societies of all countries support and pass this motion, because it is the reliance of future civilization and the destiny of mankind.

	Regarding the above accusations, the Chinese delegation has ample and complete corroboration, including films, audio recordings, photographs, letters written by prisoners of war and other documents. The Chinese delegation is fully willing to submit these materials to the conference and the press for study with the help of the conference.

    在七月三十日国际红十字大会上  我国首席代表苏井观的发言全文
    【新华社多伦多一日电】出席第十八届国际红十字大会的中华人民共和国政府代表团首席代表苏井观于七月三十日在大会总务委员会会议上发言，谴责美国干涉军严重地破坏日内瓦公约，屠杀战俘与平民、进行细菌战等罪行，并主张采取措施，维护日内瓦公约的尊严。发言全文如下：主席先生、诸位女士、诸位先生们：中国代表团认为：在这个会议上讨论施行一九四九年日内瓦公约的问题，是极其适时、极其重要的，因为在这些公约生效以后，不到一年就有一个远在朝鲜领土五千英里以外的国家，在朝鲜发动了外国干涉战争。在这个目前仍在进行中的极其残酷的、惨无人道的战争中，日内瓦公约受到严重的破坏。
    首先，一九四九年所签订的日内瓦战俘待遇公约和改善战地武装部队伤者病者境遇公约，已被破坏殆尽了。
    诸位女士、先生们：釜山战俘营和巨济岛战俘营的当局，已经使用史无前例的恐怖酷刑，虐待并屠杀朝鲜和中国部队的被俘人员。战俘随时都有被战俘营卫兵打死的危险，更不用说战俘营当局用机关枪迫着战俘赤身游行等侮辱行为了。他们集体屠杀赤手空拳的战俘，连受伤的和生病的战俘也不能幸免。这一切罪行，是任何人都否认不了的。美军前战俘营长官美军准将柯尔生已经在一九五二年五月十日的声明中承认了这些不人道的待遇的事实。美国和英国的通讯社在许多电讯中，都把巨济岛叫作恐怖岛，也是十分自然的。根据不完全的估计，仅仅在一九五一年一年内，就有七千七百多战俘因为这种虐待和酷刑而死亡。根据合众、美联、路透等通讯社的新闻报道所透露的不完全的材料，在从本年二月到七月初短短期间内，釜山和巨济岛大批屠杀战俘的事件，就有十一起。这样死伤的战俘，共有六百多人，平均每月有一百人。其结果，关于病者及伤者的日内瓦公约第十二条和关于尊重人身并给战俘以人道待遇的基本规定，就被破坏无遗了。
    此外，外国干涉者还公开蔑视日内瓦公约第一百一十八条关于战俘的明确规定。这一条规定在实际战事停止后，战俘应即予释放并遣返，不得迟延。他们并蔑视同一公约的第七条，其中规定：在任何情况下，战俘不得放弃该公约所赋予他们的权利之一部或全部。在朝鲜停战谈判中，外国干涉者用“自愿遣返”的名义提出一项荒谬绝顶的建议，这个建议实际上是要剥夺十万战俘的遣返权利而扣留他们。由于日内瓦公约中这些关于保护战俘的人道条款在朝鲜停战谈判中为两个对垒方面的一方、日内瓦公约的签字国所破坏，因此历时一年的停战谈判仍未成功，而双方成万的被俘人员一直到今天还不能返回家园，与家人团聚。
    一九四九年关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约第十七条中规定：对战俘不得施以肉体或精神上之酷刑或任何其他胁迫方式借以自彼等获得任何情报。同一公约第二十六条规定：饮食上的集体处罚措施应予禁止。但战俘营当局横暴地破坏了上述条款，竟利用胁迫、酷刑与罚饿，对战俘进行所谓“甄别”。他们还指派替两个傀儡政权工作的特务担任大部分战俘营房中的负责职务，强行在战俘们的身上刺出污蔑他们祖国的字样。此外，他们还假借战俘名义，伪造用血写的抗议书，来表示所谓拒绝返国的决心。凡是不愿意这样做的战俘们都遭到这些特务的毒打。在战俘们受重伤或昏晕后，特务就利用这一时机在战俘们身上刺字，或是在战俘们丧失知觉的时候，按住他们的手指，用他们创口上的血，在所谓“甄别”书上打手印，伪造他们“不愿返国”的决心。这些特务甚至用他们自己的手指蘸上被毒打而失去知觉的战俘们伤口上的血，来伪造手印。无数的战俘由于拒绝强迫的“甄别”而被停止口粮、被残暴地殴打或甚至遭受酷刑致死。
    第二，一九四九年关于保护平民的日内瓦公约，也被肆无忌惮地破坏了。在一度被外国干涉军占领的朝鲜北部，发生了数不尽的非法逮捕与监禁、虐待与毒刑拷打平民的事情，以及数不尽的强奸妇女、毫无罪名地、不经审讯地大批屠杀平民——其中包括许多妇女儿童甚至婴儿在内——的事情。因此，外国干涉军破坏了关于保护平民的日内瓦公约第二十七、三十二和六十八等条，并破坏了一九零七年海牙公约中关于陆战法规及惯例章程第四十六条关于占领国保护平民生命的规定。
    外国干涉军还滥肆轰炸远离前线的不设防的城市与村庄，无数次使用最不人道的凝固汽油弹。他们还有计划地以飞机轰炸，或者在撤退之前破坏非军事的、不设防的建筑物，如像教堂、艺术建筑和科学建筑、历史遗物和医院等等。所有这些行为，都破坏了战争法与惯例，特别是上述日内瓦公约的第十八条与第五十三条，上述海牙公约的第二十七条、五十五条与五十六条。
    除此之外，外国干涉军还使用了最野蛮的、甚至希特勒匪帮都没有敢于使用的战争手段，即在朝鲜北部和中国东北撒布用人工使之带菌的昆虫，来传播疾病和死亡。这种骇人听闻的行为不仅违反了一九零七年海牙公约中关于陆战法规及惯例章程以及一九二五年日内瓦议定书中所重申的、众所公认的禁止细菌战的法律，而且也是一种罪恶滔天的罪行，这种罪行违反日内瓦公约的基本精神，违反红十字的人道精神。
    主席先生、各位女士与各位先生：全世界所有主张人道与爱好和平的人们，都不能不对这种违反日内瓦公约的残酷行为感到极度的震惊与极度的愤慨。这次会议所揭櫫的基本目的是维护人道与和平，如果它不能郑重宣布坚决反对这种暴行和破坏公约的行为，那么本会议在世界人民心目中的道义地位和威信就会遭到致命打击，朝鲜平民以及朝中被俘人员今天所遭受的骇人的苦难，就会落到其他任何国家明天可能成为战俘的人的头上。尤有甚者，如果不设法制止这种破坏公约的行为，崇高的人道与和平事业今后就会被淹没在野蛮暴行的血泊里。
    鉴于上述理由，中国代表团提议大会通过以下决议，以维护日内瓦公约的尊严：
    “第十八届国际红十字大会注意到朝鲜釜山和巨济岛战俘营的战俘遭到残酷虐待和大批屠杀、被迫受所谓‘甄别’并被取消了被遣返的权利；
    大会又注意到在朝鲜北部不设防的城市和乡村遭到滥炸，和平居民被大批屠杀，宗教的、文化的和慈善的机关恣意破坏；
    大会认为以上这些在朝鲜的所作所为严重地破坏了一九四九年的三项日内瓦公约，即‘关于战俘待遇之公约’、‘改善战地武装部队伤者病者境遇之公约’及‘关于战时保护平民之公约’。
    因此，大会谴责这种严重破坏日内瓦公约和违反红十字的人道原则的行为；
    大会并号召各国红十字会共同努力，动员世界舆论要求立即制止在朝鲜的违反日内瓦公约的一切暴行，以求公约的无上尊严得以保持。”
    中国代表团恳切要求各国政府的、各国红十字会的一切有良心的代表支持并通过这个议案，因为它是未来的文明和人类命运的依靠。
    关于以上所提出的控诉，中国代表团有充分的和完全的佐证，包括电影、录音片、照片、战俘们写的信以及其他文件。中国代表团完全愿意在大会帮助下把这些东西提交大会和报界研究。
