    On the Datong River tributary in Korea, the Daecen River and the Songseok River, stand four stone dams. They stand like a solid wall in the middle of the river, driving the rushing river water to obediently irrigate the 120,660 pyeong (approximately 600-700 mu in China) of land in four ri (Korean administrative unit, equivalent to a village).

    A month ago, there were only a few decayed tree stumps here. The original old dam had long been bombed by enemy planes; it was completely washed away by the flash floods last summer.

    In April, the rice planting season was approaching, but without water for irrigation, all 120,000 pyeong of land would become dry land. According to the estimates of the local myeon (Korean administrative unit, equivalent to a district) government, the annual yield of these lands is more than 289,000 jin; if dry land crops were planted instead, the annual yield would only be more than 76,000 jin. The local people would lose more than 210,000 jin of grain this year. However, to repair the dam, at least 5,000 workers would be needed. Even if all the labor force in the four ri were mobilized for a crash repair, it would take at least twenty days to complete. The farmers were busy with spring plowing, so who would repair the dam? This was a difficult problem to solve, and the farmers were worried: "We won't be able to plant paddy fields this year!"

    The commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed there deeply understood the difficulties of the local people. During the spring famine, they saved more than 10,000 jin of food rations to relieve the local people's spring famine. Although the unit's tasks were heavy, they still took the time to help the farmers with spring plowing and decided to help them build the dam so that the Korean people could harvest more grain every year. They spent four hours every day on crash labor, and all their time on Sundays.

    The project began on April 7. Shovels and hoes flew on the site. The soldiers ran more than a li away, climbed up the steep cliffs by holding onto tree branches, and chiseled down the stones. Five or six people together carried large stones weighing hundreds to more than a thousand jin, their shoulders red and swollen from the pressure. In the ice water that had just thawed, they took off their cotton clothes and jumped down to build the dam foundation. During the same period, they also filled in the bomb craters densely covering the old ditches and dug new ditches twenty li long. This was an arduous labor, and the soldiers worked enthusiastically as if they were fighting a fierce battle. Cheerful songs resounded throughout the valleys and riverbanks, and encouraging slogans rose one after another. Wang Dongshan, a Communist Party member who was the first to jump into the icy water, said: "For the liberation cause of the Korean people, we can dedicate our lives; for the Korean people to live a good life, we don't mind any hardship!"

    The myeon government knew that the unit had tight schedules and was afraid that they would be overworked, so they told them that the dam only needed to be three meters wide and one meter high. However, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers planned for the long-term interests of the Korean people. They used tens of thousands of stones and built a stone dam five meters wide and three meters high, as strong as steel, in half a month.

    While the Chinese People's Volunteers were repairing the dam, the Korean farmers were beaming with joy and their enthusiasm for labor was even higher. They warmly responded to General Kim Il-sung's call, guaranteeing deep plowing, careful cultivation, and more fertilizer application, so that the overall yield would be 480,000 jin more than last year, and 62,000 jin more of public grain would be handed over to support the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. This myeon completed the wheat planting task five days ahead of schedule this year and won the glorious title of "Wheat Planting Model Myeon".

    On the day the dam project was completed, a grand celebration was held by the local military and civilians. The elderly and the soldiers shook hands tightly. The women dressed in festive costumes and danced enthusiastically and happily. With solemn etiquette, they presented a silk banner with the words "Unforgettable International Friendship" to the Chinese People's Volunteers. Zhu Lizhang, a 74-year-old farmer, grabbed the hand of a Chinese People's Volunteer soldier and said in a trembling voice: "The American-Li bandits killed our people, robbed our things, and bombed our dam. The Chinese People's Volunteers drove away the enemy and rebuilt the dam. I want to tell our children and grandchildren that when they live a happy life in the future, they must always remember our sincere friends - the great Chinese people and their Chinese People's Volunteers."

    The news of the Chinese People's Volunteers repairing the dam quickly spread to the highest leading organs of the Korean people. The Korean Central Ministry of Internal Affairs Chorus, the Korean Central Literary and Art General Alliance, and the Korean Cultural Association all rushed to offer comfort performances. The Deputy Chairman of the Korean State Planning Commission and representatives of the South Pyongan Province leading organs also came to offer comfort and presented the Chinese People's Volunteer unit with a finely embroidered silk banner with the words: "Long Live the Great Unity of the Chinese and Korean Armies and People!"

    充满了中朝人民友情的水坝
    前驱
    在朝鲜大同江的支流——大岑河和松石河上，矗立着四个石坝。它们像一堵坚厚的城墙横在河的当中，驱使奔流的河水驯服地去灌溉四个里（朝鲜的行政单位，相当于村）的十二万零六百六十坪（约合中国六、七百亩）土地。
    一个月以前，这里只有几根枯朽了的树桩。原有的旧坝早被敌机炸塌；去年夏季山洪暴涨时，全部被冲垮了。
    四月里，插秧的季节快到了，可是没有水灌溉，这十二万多坪土地，就要全部变成旱地。据当地面（朝鲜行政单位，相当于区）政府估计：这些土地的年产量是二十八万九千多斤；如果改种旱田，年产量只有七万六千多斤，当地人民今年就要损失二十一万多斤粮食。但是要把坝修好，至少需五千个工。即使动员四个里所有的劳动力突击整修，最快也要二十天才能完成。农民正忙着春耕，一修坝，那有人春耕呢？这是一个难以解决的困难，农民们都焦虑着：“今年种不上水田了！”
    驻在当地的志愿军某部指战员们，深切了解到当地人民的困难。春荒时，他们节省下一万多斤口粮救济了当地人民的春荒。虽然部队任务繁重，他们还抽出时间帮助农民春耕，并且决定要帮助他们把水坝修起，好让朝鲜人民年年多打粮食。他们每天抽出四小时进行突击劳动，星期日是全部时间。
    工程在四月七日开始，现场上锹镐飞舞，战士们跑到一里地以外，攀着树枝爬上陡削的山崖，把石头凿下来。五、六个人一起抬着每块几百斤到一千多斤的大石头，双肩压得红肿。在解冻不久的冰水里，他们脱下棉衣跳下去修砌坝基。同一期间，他们又填平了旧有沟渠上密布的弹坑，掘挖了二十里长的新沟渠。这是一场艰苦的劳动，战士们像进行激烈战斗似地热情工作着。愉快的歌声响彻山谷河畔，鼓动口号声此起彼伏。第一个跳下冰水中去工作的共产党员王东山说：“为了朝鲜人民的解放事业，我们可以献出自己的生命；为了朝鲜人民过上好日子，我们再苦也没有什么关系！”
    面政府知道部队任务很紧，怕他们过分劳累，告诉他们坝只要三米宽、一米高就可以了。可是志愿军指战员给朝鲜人民作长远打算，他们用几万块石头，在半个月间修成了五米宽三米高像钢铁样坚固的石坝。
    在志愿军修坝的时候，朝鲜农民喜气洋洋，劳动热情更加高涨。他们热烈响应金日成将军的号召，保证深耕细作、多施肥料，使全面要比去年多打四十八万斤粮，多交六万二千斤公粮，以支援人民军和志愿军。这个面今年提前五天完成了种麦任务，荣获“种麦模范面”的光荣称号。
    水坝工程竣工的那一天，当地军民举行了盛大的庆祝会。老年人和战士们紧紧地握手。妇女们穿起节日的盛装，热情愉快地跳着舞。他们以隆重的礼节，把一面写有“最难忘的国际友情”字样的锦旗献给志愿军。七十四岁的老农民朱礼章拉住一个志愿军战士的手，用激动得发抖的声音说：“美李匪帮杀死了我们的人，抢走了我们的东西，炸坏了我们的坝，志愿军赶走敌人又修起坝，我要告诉我们的子子孙孙，当他们将来过着幸福生活的时候，要永远记住我们真挚的朋友——伟大的中国人民和他们的志愿军。”
    志愿军修坝的消息，很快传到了朝鲜人民的最高领导机关，朝鲜中央内务署协奏团、朝鲜中央文学艺术总同盟、朝鲜文化协会，都先后赶来作慰问演出。朝鲜国家计划委员会副委员长、平安南道领导机关的代表等也亲来慰问，并赠给志愿军某部一面精工细绣的锦旗，旗上写着：“中朝军民大团结万岁！”
