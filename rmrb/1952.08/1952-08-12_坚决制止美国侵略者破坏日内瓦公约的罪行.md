Resolutely Stop the American Aggressors' Crimes of Violating the Geneva Conventions

Today is the third anniversary of the signing of the revised Geneva Conventions. The revision of the Geneva Conventions was intended to improve the conditions of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked members of armed forces in the field and at sea, to stipulate the treatment of prisoners of war, and to protect civilians in wartime. Its content is fundamentally conducive to lasting international peace and conforms to humanitarian principles. Sixty-two countries participated in the signing of these conventions on August 12, 1949. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government, issued a statement on July 13 this year, authorized to recognize the Geneva Conventions. Therefore, the Geneva Conventions are universally recognized wartime regulations by all countries in the world, and all countries must abide by these conventions. However, less than a year after the revised Geneva Conventions were signed, the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, blatantly disregarding international credibility and desperately trampling and destroying the Geneva Conventions.

The American aggressors' acts of aggression against the peace-loving people of Korea have long violated all international law and the most basic principles of human morality. It is universally recognized that acts of aggression are the most serious crimes against humanity. The American aggressors' planned use of inhumane bacteriological weapons in Korea and our country is a serious violation of the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925. The American aggressors' acts of insulting, abusing, and massacring our captured personnel, their conspiracy to detain our captured personnel, and their barbaric acts of wantonly bombing the peaceful people and peaceful facilities of Korea, directly violated the Geneva Conventions. The United States is one of the participants and signatories to the revised Geneva Conventions. The international obligations regarding prisoners of war that the United States undertook under these conventions were reaffirmed by the US representative to the United Nations, Austin, in July 1951. At that time, Austin, in a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, guaranteed that the US military invading Korea would abide by these conventions. At the Korean armistice talks, the US side also shamelessly posed as "strict observers" of the Geneva Conventions regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. However, the countless bloody atrocities that occurred in prisoner-of-war camps in Geoje Island, Busan, Nonsan, and other places, as well as the US side's absurd and outrageous insistence on forcibly detaining prisoners of war at the armistice talks, prove that all the promises and guarantees made by the American aggressors regarding the treatment of prisoners of war were just shameful lies. Their purpose was nothing more than to confuse world public opinion and cover up their crimes of violating the Geneva Conventions.

The reason why the discussion on the prisoner-of-war issue at the Korean armistice talks has not been resolved from December last year to the present is entirely because the American aggressors insisted on the absurd proposition of so-called "voluntary repatriation" which is actually the forced detention of prisoners of war, and conspired to detain a large number of our captured personnel. This is a blatant violation of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions. Article 118 of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War clearly stipulates: "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities." Article 7 of the same Convention also stipulates: "Prisoners of war may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention." However, the American aggressors blatantly disregarded these universally recognized principles and, in the Korean armistice talks, arbitrarily and unreasonably insisted on the absurd proposition of so-called "voluntary repatriation," later changed to "no forced repatriation," openly fabricating that only 70,000, later changed to 83,000, of our captured personnel were willing to be repatriated, still attempting to forcibly detain 20 percent of the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and 68 percent of the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Obviously, the absurd proposition of the American aggressors to detain our captured personnel is a thorough violation of humanitarian principles and a destruction of the Geneva Conventions. Even many bourgeois newspapers in Britain and the United States have had to admit this fact.

In order to achieve its despicable purpose of detaining our captured personnel, the American aggressors adopted various inhuman atrocities against our captured personnel, which also seriously violated the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Article 13 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated," and the same article and Article 3 stipulate that prisoners of war must be protected from ill-treatment, threats, insults, or injuries to their bodies. However, the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities on Geoje Island, Busan, and other places have used unprecedented terror and torture, arbitrarily abused and massacred our captured personnel, and used all brutal methods such as forced writing of blood letters, forced tattooing, and forced thumbprinting to torment and persecute our captured personnel both mentally and physically, in an attempt to force them to "refuse repatriation." Article 17 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever," but the American aggressors used a large number of Kuomintang remnants from Taiwan and special agents from the Li Seung-man gang to conduct activities in the prisoner-of-war camps, forcing many prisoners of war to act as special agents. Article 26 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "Collective punishment for acts affecting food, shall be prohibited," but the American aggressors frequently stopped supplying rations to our captured personnel. In short, all the solemn provisions of the Geneva Conventions have been completely violated by the American aggressors. If our captured personnel resisted slightly, they were subjected to abuse and collective massacres, and even the wounded and sick were not spared. According to extremely incomplete statistics, in 1951 alone, more than 7,700 of our captured personnel were beaten to death, or died as a result of unbearable torture and abuse. According to incomplete materials revealed by the US and British news agencies, from February to July this year, the American aggressors directly killed more than 700 of our captured personnel. All these crimes of the American aggressors cannot be covered up by any lies. Colson, the former head of the US aggressor army's prisoner-of-war camp, had to admit in his statement on May 10 this year the facts of the inhumane treatment of our captured personnel and the violation of the Geneva Conventions by the US aggressor army.

The barbaric acts of the American aggressors in abusing and detaining prisoners of war and openly tearing up the Geneva Conventions have aroused increasingly strong anger and hatred among the people of Korea and China and all peace-loving people in the world. In order to cover up its crimes, in addition to making all kinds of sophistry and denial, the American aggressor attempted to urge five countries, including India and Indonesia, to send representatives to Geoje Island for "inspection," hoping that these countries would absolve it of its crimes of violating the Geneva Conventions. However, this conspiracy of the American aggressors was rejected by India and other countries and failed to materialize. Because the fact that the American aggressors violated the Geneva Conventions has become known to everyone, and no self-respecting country is willing to go there to be fooled by it. Now, the tool used by the American aggressors to cover up its crimes is the Red Cross "International" Committee, composed of 25 Swiss merchants closely related to American monopoly capitalists. This Red Cross "International" Committee, which claims to be "impartial and selfless," just as it covered up the atrocities of Hitler's Germany in World War II, attempts to conceal the facts of the American aggressors' violation of the Geneva Conventions by fabricating false reports and praising those Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camps, which have been dubbed "Islands of Terror" by American journalists, as being in "good condition." It has never made any serious accusations against the American aggressors for their large-scale massacre of prisoners of war and Korean civilians, and for their crimes of violating the Geneva Conventions. This is the record of the Red Cross "International" Committee serving the American aggressors in violation of the spirit of humanity.

In contrast to the American aggressors, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces have consistently adopted a policy of humanitarian leniency towards US prisoners of war. The Korean and Chinese People's Forces not only do not kill, beat, scold, or insult the dignity of any prisoners of war, but also provide them with sufficient food and good medical treatment for wounded and sick prisoners of war. When the Korean armistice talks began to discuss the issue of prisoners of war last December, we proposed the fair and reasonable proposition of the complete release and repatriation of prisoners of war by both sides, and have made unremitting efforts for this purpose. Now we still firmly advocate that both sides repatriate all foreign prisoners of war and all prisoners of war whose homes are in the region to which they originally belonged, so that all prisoners of war can return home to reunite with their relatives and resume peaceful lives. The fact that we give prisoners of war humane treatment during wartime, and the proposition that all prisoners of war should be repatriated to their homes to live peaceful lives after the armistice, are fully in line with the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and have won unanimous praise from all peace-loving people in the world. The consistent humanitarian and lenient policy of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces towards prisoners of war is a clear contrast to the American aggressors' crimes of massacring and detaining prisoners of war and violating the Geneva Conventions. Today, all the clauses of the draft armistice agreement have been agreed upon, and the only key to achieving the Korean armistice is the fair and reasonable resolution of the only remaining prisoner-of-war repatriation issue in the armistice talks; and the key to resolving the prisoner-of-war repatriation issue is that the American aggressors must abide by the Geneva Conventions, abandon their criminal conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war in accordance with Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement, and release and repatriate all prisoners of war.

People all over the world know that the despicable purpose of the American aggressors in detaining our captured personnel is to prepare to send them to the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan and the Li Seung-man gang to serve as cannon fodder for aggression. The American aggressors' attempt to further expand the war of aggression and continue to threaten peace and security in Asia and the world has long been exposed. Therefore, all countries that have signed the Geneva Conventions and all peace-loving people in the world should rise up and resolutely stop the American aggressors' crimes of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and violating the Geneva Conventions, expose the American aggressors' conspiracy to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice talks and expand the war of aggression, in order to defend peace and security in Asia and the world, and uphold the dignity of the Geneva Conventions.

### 坚决制止美国侵略者破坏日内瓦公约的罪行

    坚决制止美国侵略者破坏日内瓦公约的罪行
    今天是日内瓦公约修订签字三周年的日子。日内瓦各项公约的修订，是为了改善战地和海上武装部队伤者、病者及遇船难者的境遇，规定战俘待遇，保护战时平民。其内容基本上是有利于国际持久和平，并符合于人道主义原则的。一九四九年八月十二日参加这些公约签字的有六十二个国家。我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长于今年七月十三日受权发表声明，对日内瓦各项公约已予以承认。因此，日内瓦公约是目前世界各国所一致公认的战时法规，一切国家都应该遵守这些公约。可是，就在日内瓦各项公约修订签字不到一年的时候，美帝国主义者就发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，公然不顾国际信义，穷凶极恶地蹂躏与破坏了日内瓦公约。
    美国侵略者对朝鲜爱好和平人民的侵略行为，早已破坏了所有国际公法和人类道德的最基本原则。举世公认侵略行为就是违反人道的最严重的罪行。美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国有计划地使用灭绝人性的细菌武器，更是对一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书的严重破坏。美国侵略者对于我方被俘人员的侮辱、虐待和集体屠杀的暴行，企图扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋，以及狂轰滥炸朝鲜和平人民、和平设施的野蛮行为，则直接地破坏了日内瓦各项公约。美国是修订日内瓦各项公约的参加者和签字国家之一。美国依照这些公约所担承的关于战俘的国际义务，曾由美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀于一九五一年七月加以确认。当时奥斯汀在致联合国秘书长的信中，曾保证侵朝美军遵守这些公约。在朝鲜停战谈判会上，美方也不断厚颜无耻地以关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约的“严格遵守者”自居。但是，巨济岛、釜山、论山等地战俘营所发生的无数血腥暴行，以及美方在停战谈判会上坚持强迫扣留战俘的荒谬绝顶的主张，都证明美国侵略者对于战俘待遇所作的一切诺言和保证，只是可耻的谎言。其目的无非是在混淆世界人民的视听，掩盖它破坏日内瓦公约的罪行。
    朝鲜停战谈判关于战俘问题的讨论，从去年十二月迄今所以得不到解决，完全是因为美国侵略者坚持所谓“自愿遣返”实则强迫扣留战俘的荒谬主张，阴谋扣留我方大批被俘人员。这是公然违反日内瓦公约的规定的。关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约第一百一十八条曾明确规定：“实际战事停止后，战俘应即予释放并遣返，不得迟延”。同一公约第七条又规定：“在任何情况下，战俘不得放弃本公约所赋予他们的权利之一部或全部”。可是，美国侵略者公然蔑视这些为各国所一致公认的原则，在朝鲜停战谈判中，蛮横无理地坚持所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，企图剥夺我方被俘人员的遣返权利而强迫扣留他们。最初，美方提出“一对一交换”、“战俘与平民交换”等荒谬建议，企图扣留我方绝大部分的被俘人员。这个阴谋失败后，美方就提出所谓“自愿遣返”、后来改为“不得强迫遣返”的主张，公然捏造我方被俘人员只有七万人、后来又改为八万三千人愿意遣返，仍图强迫扣留百分之二十的朝鲜人民军被俘人员和百分之六十八的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。显然，美国侵略者这种扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张，是彻头彻尾违反人道原则和破坏日内瓦公约的。连英美许多资产阶级的报纸也不得不承认这一事实。
    美国侵略者为了达到它扣留我方被俘人员的卑污目的，对我方被俘人员采取了各种非人道的暴行，同样严重地破坏了关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约。日内瓦公约第十三条中规定：“战俘在任何时须受人道之待遇”，同条和第三条并规定要保护战俘不受虐待、威胁、侮辱或毁伤他们的身体。可是巨济岛、釜山等地的美国战俘营当局，已经使用史无前例的恐怖酷刑，任意虐待和屠杀我方被俘人员，并用强迫写血书、强迫刺字、强迫盖指纹等一切残暴的办法，从精神和肉体两方面来磨折和迫害我方被俘人员，企图逼使他们“拒绝遣返”。日内瓦公约第十七条规定：“对战俘不得施以肉体或精神上的酷刑或任何其他胁迫方式借以自彼等获得任何情报”，美国侵略者却利用大批台湾国民党残匪和李承晚匪帮的特务在战俘营进行活动，逼迫许多战俘充当特务。日内瓦公约第二十六条规定：“饮食上的集体处罚措施应予禁止”，而美国侵略者却经常停止发给我方被俘人员口粮。总之，日内瓦公约的一切庄严的条文，都被美国侵略者破坏无遗了。我方被俘人员稍一反抗，便遭到虐待和集体屠杀，连受伤和生病的人也不能幸免。根据极不完全的统计，仅一九五一年一年内，就有七千七百多我方被俘人员被打死，或因不堪酷刑和虐待而死亡。根据美英通讯社所透露的不完全材料，自今年二月至七月，美国侵略者直接杀害我方被俘人员已达七百多人。美国侵略者的这一切罪行，是任何谎言都掩盖不了的。美国侵略军前战俘营负责人柯尔生在今年五月十日的声明中，早已不得不承认了美国侵略军对待我方被俘人员的不人道待遇、违反日内瓦公约的事实。
    美国侵略者这种虐待与扣留战俘、公然撕毁日内瓦公约的野蛮行为，已经激起了朝中人民和世界一切爱好和平人民日益强烈的愤怒和仇恨。美国侵略者为了掩盖它的罪行，除了百般进行狡辩抵赖以外，曾企图促使印度、印尼等五个国家派遣代表赴巨济岛“视察”，希望这些国家为它破坏日内瓦公约的罪行解脱责任。但是，美国侵略者这一阴谋勾当遭到了印度等国的拒绝未能实现。因为美国侵略者破坏日内瓦公约的事实，已经尽人皆知，没有任何一个自尊的国家，愿意到那里去受它的愚弄。现在，美国侵略者掩饰其罪行的工具，就是一个由与美国垄断资本家有着密切联系的二十五个瑞士大商人所组成的红十字“国际”委员会了。这个自称“公正无私”的红十字“国际”委员会，和它在第二次世界大战中掩饰希特勒德国的暴行一样，用捏造假报告和赞美那些被美国记者自称为“恐怖之岛”的巨济岛战俘营为“情况良好”的方法，企图隐蔽美国侵略者破坏日内瓦公约的事实。它对于美国侵略者大规模屠杀战俘和朝鲜平民、破坏日内瓦公约的罪行，从来没有加以任何严正的指责，这就是红十字“国际”委员会违反人道精神为美国侵略者服务的记录。
    与美国侵略者相反，朝中人民部队对于美方战俘，则一贯采取人道主义的宽待政策。朝中人民部队不仅对一切战俘不杀、不打、不骂、不侮辱人格，而且给他们以足够的食物，给伤病战俘以良好的医药治疗。朝鲜停战谈判去年十二月开始讨论战俘问题的时候，我方便提出了双方全部释放并遣返战俘的公平合理主张，并为此进行了不懈的努力。现在我方仍然坚决主张双方遣返全部外籍战俘和全部家在原属一方地区的战俘，让一切战俘都能回家与亲人团聚，重度和平生活。我方在战时给战俘以人道待遇的事实，及在停战后全部遣返战俘回家过和平生活的主张，是完全符合日内瓦公约的规定的，并赢得了全世界一切爱好和平人民的一致赞扬。朝中人民部队对战俘一贯采取人道主义的宽待政策，与美国侵略者屠杀和扣留战俘、破坏日内瓦公约的罪行是一个显明的对照。今天停战协定草案的全部条款已经达成协议，实现朝鲜停战的唯一关键，只是停战谈判中唯一剩余的战俘遣返问题的公平合理解决；而解决战俘遣返问题的关键，是要美国侵略者遵守日内瓦公约，依照停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款放弃其强迫扣留战俘的罪恶阴谋，释放和遣返全部战俘。
    全世界人民都知道，美国侵略者扣留我方被俘人员的卑鄙目的，是准备把他们送交给台湾国民党残匪和李承晚匪帮充当侵略炮灰的。美国侵略者企图进一步扩大侵略战争，继续威胁亚洲及世界的和平与安全，这种凶恶的野心早已昭然若揭了。因此，一切在日内瓦公约上签字的国家以及全世界爱好和平人民，都应该起来坚决制止美国侵略者强迫扣留战俘，破坏日内瓦公约的罪行，揭露美国侵略者拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，扩大侵略战争的阴谋，以保卫亚洲及世界的和平与安全，并维护日内瓦公约的庄严。
