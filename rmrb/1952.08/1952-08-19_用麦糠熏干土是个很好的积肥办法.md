    Using Wheat Bran to Smoke Dry Soil is a Great Way to Accumulate Fertilizer
    To the Editor:
    In order to lay the foundation for a bumper wheat harvest next year, the farmers of Zhuangtou Village, District One, Licheng, Shanxi, have launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign. However, the local old method of using bran to rot fertilizer has many drawbacks: it easily breeds walnut insects and easily transmits wheat diseases. The members of the labor model Li Songhuai mutual aid group came up with a method of using wheat bran to smoke dry soil for fertilizer accumulation, which solved this problem. The method of smoking dry soil with wheat bran is similar to burning lime. First, stack the soil clods into a pile (not too solid), and then around the soil pile, from bottom to top, place a layer of wheat bran and a layer of soil clods, stacking it to a height of three or four chi, gradually narrowing the top until it is six or seven chi high. Leave a hole at the top. After stacking, start burning from the hole at the top; the top opening should be covered, covering about a quarter of it. Each pile of soil clods should be smoked for five to seven days. After smoking, it is best to water it, and then cover it with a layer of dry soil. Apply it when planting wheat, and the fertilizer effect will be great.

    用麦糠熏干土是个很好的积肥办法
    编辑同志：山西黎城一区庄头村农民为了打下明年小麦丰产的基础，展开了积肥运动。但当地旧有的用糠沤肥的办法，有很多流弊：容易生核桃虫，又容易传染小麦病害。劳动模范李宋怀互助组组员们想出了用麦糠熏干土的积肥办法，解决了这个问题。麦糠熏干土的办法和烧石灰相似。先把土块架成堆（不要太实），然后在土堆周围，从下而上地放一层麦糠放一层土块，垒到三、四尺高，逐渐把顶缩小，直到六、七尺高为止。顶上留出一个窟窿。垒成以后，从顶上窟窿开始点火燃烧；顶口要加盖，约盖住四分之一光景。每堆土块要熏五天到七天。熏成后，最好用水灌一下，然后再用一层干土盖住，等到种麦时施用，肥效很大。
