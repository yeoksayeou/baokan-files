    CPC Zhengyang County Committee Organization Department Investigates Wang Shilin's Human Rights Violations

    Editor,

    Based on the critical letter "Zhengyang County Deputy Head Wang Shilin Should Not Infringe on Human Rights," published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on July 17th, we asked Comrade Wang Shilin to make a self-criticism, and we have agreed with his self-criticism. Regarding Comrade Wang Shilin's mistakes, we plan to address them in conjunction with our county-level rectification study session in August.

    The Organization Department of the CPC Henan Province, Zhengyang County Committee

    Attached is an abstract of Wang Shilin's self-criticism report:

    From the examination of the wrongful arrest of farmer Zhang Dianjia and others, I have realized that:

    (1) The main reason why I wrongfully arrested people is due to my bureaucratic work style. In handling work matters, I often displayed subjective and individualistic heroism. I thought that what I did was right, and I even had privileged thinking. For example, when I wanted to arrest people without clarifying the situation, Comrade Li Qingyun of the County Public Security Bureau raised objections to me, and I thought, "Am I not allowed to arrest people as the deputy county head?" I instead criticized Comrade Li Qingyun. This was extremely wrong. (2) The reason why I seriously violated the policies of the Party and the People's Government is also because I have a hegemonic work style. This style is a concrete manifestation of reactionary ruling class thinking, standing above the masses and lacking any mass perspective. I did not realize that I am a hired hand of the people. (3) My behavior is also undisciplined and unorganized, and it is very harmful to the country and the people, and the losses caused to the Party are also very serious. I request the organization to give me the punishment I deserve. Wang Shilin

    中共正阳县委员会组织部检查王士林侵犯人权问题
    编辑同志：根据七月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的“正阳县副县长王士林不应该侵犯人权”的批评信，我们让王士林同志作了检讨，我们并同意他的检讨。对王士林同志的错误，我们准备结合八月里我县的县级整风学习进行处理。
    中共河南省正阳县委员会组织部
    附王士林的检讨报告（摘要）
    从错捕农民张殿甲等事件的检查中，我认识到：
    （一）我之所以错捕人，主要由于我有官僚主义作风。我在处理工作问题时，常常表现了主观主义和个人英雄主义等思想。我认为自己办的事就是对的，并且我还有特权思想。如当我没有弄清情况就要捕人的时候，县公安局李清云同志曾对我提出意见，我还想：“自己是副县长，还不能捕人吗？”我反而将李清云同志批评了一顿。这是极端错误的。（二）我所以严重地违反了党和人民政府的政策，也因为我有恶霸作风。这种作风是一种反动统治阶级思想的具体表现，是站在群众头上的、毫无群众观点的具体表现。我没有认识到自己是人民的长工。（三）我的行为，也是无组织、无纪律的行为，对国家、对人民的危害很大，给党造成的损失也是很严重的。我请求组织给我应得的处分。王士林
