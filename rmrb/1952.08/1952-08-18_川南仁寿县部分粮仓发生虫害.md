    Insect Pests Infest Some Grain Depots in Renshou County, Southern Sichuan
    Comrade Editor: During this year's summer grain requisition in Renshou County, southern Sichuan, some district and township cadres were irresponsible, leading to the discovery of serious insect infestations in wheat depots in some areas. For example, a July 7th inspection of the wheat depots in Renshou's First District revealed that in Depot No. 10, there were an average of eight rice weevils per jin of wheat; in Depot No. 14, there were an average of twenty. However, by the July 13th inspection, Depot No. 10 had bred to approximately nineteen per jin, and Depot No. 14 had bred to forty-three.
    The reason for this serious insect infestation is that cadres in the county generally focused solely on completing the task quickly, neglecting the quality of the requisitioned wheat. For example, Jia Shucheng, the finance and grain assistant in the First District, ordered all townships in the district to complete the ten-day summer requisition task in three days. This inevitably led to the masses mixing dry and wet wheat together, making inspection in the depots impossible. Even when problems were discovered, depot cadres did not uphold principles and failed to raise objections, carelessly accepting the grain. Some depot cadres even mistakenly believed that inspection would lead others to accuse them of "bureaucracy" and lacking a "masses viewpoint," thus wasting the state's stored grain for nothing.
    Currently, some depots in the county are actively carrying out rescue and prevention measures against the insect infestation. However, this lesson should be taken seriously by cadres in all areas that are currently conducting summer grain requisition or have completed it and are transporting grain to the depots.

### 川南仁寿县部分粮仓发生虫害

    川南仁寿县部分粮仓发生虫害
    编辑同志：川南仁寿县在今年夏征中，由于某些区乡干部对工作不负责任，以致部分地区小麦仓中发现严重虫害。如七月七日检查仁寿一区小麦仓统计，十号仓，平均每斤小麦有米象虫八个；十四号仓，平均每斤有二十个；但在七月十三日的检查统计，十号仓已繁殖到每斤十九个左右，十四号仓繁殖到四十三个左右。
    产生这种严重虫害的原因，也是由于该县一般干部单纯抢时完成任务而忽视征收小麦的质量所致。如一区财粮助理贾树成，把上级布置的十天夏征任务，命令全区乡三天完成，这样即不免造成群众把干、湿不同的小麦混在一起，使仓里无法检查；有时虽检查出来，但仓库干部也不坚持原则，不提出意见，却马虎收下。甚至有的仓库干部错误地认为检查会使别人说自己是“官僚主义”、没有“群众观点”。因而把国家仓库粮食白白糟蹋。
    现在该县部分仓库，正积极对虫害进行救治和防范，但这一教训应引起正在进行夏征或夏征完毕正运粮入仓的各地干部加以重视。
