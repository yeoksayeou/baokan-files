    At the Front Line
    Zhang Zhimin
    After crossing a small bridge, we arrived at the forward position of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. We sat on the edge of a trench to rest, looking back at the river we had just crossed, which was the enemy's so-called "artillery blockade zone." Under the continuous bombing of the enemy's artillery fire, the hills on both sides of the bridge were often submerged in flames. Today, new soil was turned up on yesterday's old bomb craters. Anywhere you stoop down, you can pick up rusted and still gunpowder-smelling shrapnel. It is said that for several months, the enemy has been using several long-range artillery groups specifically to blockade the bridges here. The enemy's artillery spotters correct the deviation of their artillery fire here every day from dawn to dusk. At night, in addition to even more concentrated artillery fire than during the day, night-flying aircraft drop strings of bombs here, regardless of whether there are targets. The enemy has exhausted every means and wrung his brains dry to blockade this essential road leading to our forward position.
    However, the deputy political commissar who brought me to the front-line position told me: "No matter how concentrated the enemy's artillery fire is, no matter how many bombs he drops, our bridge cannot be broken."
    I completely believe him, and our road to the front line will never be blocked by the enemy; but I can't understand why the enemy's concentrated artillery fire and bombing can't break such a small wooden bridge. Just then, a volley of enemy artillery exploded near the bridge, and the entire river valley was filled with smoke and dust, and the bridge disappeared in the artillery fire. I asked him: "Why can't it be broken?"
    He didn't answer me at the time, but simply said: "You'll understand when you climb another hill."
    When we climbed another higher hill, I looked back at the river below. There were countless wooden bridges on the winding water surface, dividing the river into countless small sections. I was amazed at the strength and wisdom of the people's forces, and the deputy political commissar pointed me to the foot of the mountain and the river, where enemy aircraft were buried one by one. The remains of the enemy aircraft closest to us, burned and charred, lay half in the water and half on the shore. Several relatively intact iron plates had been removed by our engineers and used to pave the bridge surface.
    Following the winding, snake-like trenches, we walked into a small town. A sign was written in red letters: "Hero Street." The deputy political commissar joked: "We've arrived at 'Tianqiao'! Look how lively it is!" We walked slowly, looking at the entrances of the holes on both sides of the trench, one after another, all made with wooden boards from ammunition boxes, with horizontal plaques hung in front of them, reading: "Artillerymen's Home," "Hero Canteen," "Hero Barber Shop," "Merit Cave"... everywhere attracting me to stop and take a closer look. At this time, a sentry comrade greeted us: "Comrades, hurry inside, the enemy is going to shell!"
    Sure enough, just as we entered the hole, several shells landed on the position. I really admired the sentry comrade's alertness. After the shells exploded, I walked up to him and wanted to know why he could judge so accurately. This young soldier told me very confidently: "The enemy is in my palm! As soon as he wags his tail, I know what kind of dung he's going to drop."
    Our soldiers are so brave, smart, thoughtful, and educated that any enemy will be defeated in front of them.
    Reaching the most forward position, before I could see anything, the comrades led me into a tunnel that ran through the entire ridge. The soldiers named this tunnel "Make Truman Angry!" We walked inside for a long time. I used a flashlight to illuminate the road and the walls on both sides, which were black stone, some places with a reddish-copper color. Squad Leader Jiang Bingwen took a bullet box and asked me to sit down. Then, he readily took a piece of stone, as heavy as gold, and showed it to me, and told me: "This is the gold nugget we dug out of this mine." We all laughed. The huge scale of this tunnel is no less than excavating a small mine. Every one of our soldiers is an infantryman, an engineer, and also an engineer.
    When we reached the most forward position of the front line, I really wanted to see the situation on the enemy's side. I was asking how far the nearest place to the enemy was when a soldier ran in from outside, shouting: "Another enemy is stealing food again!" The squad leader knew he was being facetious, so he deliberately asked him: "How do you know?" The soldier said seriously: "That kid is getting beaten by his squad leader!" I was very interested, so I immediately asked them to take me out to see, but I didn't expect this soldier to answer: "You can't see it, but I heard the enemy crying."
    I know how close we are to the enemy, even the enemy's cries can be heard; and I also know that the soldiers who guard here are as familiar with the enemy as they are with their own fingers. I was about to ask the soldier's name when the squad leader introduced me: "This is our famous hunter Yang Daorun. The enemy is most afraid of his eyes, because if he sees them, they can't escape." Finally, he added emphatically: "Our little hero is only eighteen years old!"
    How surprised I was to hear the squad leader's words! I warmly greeted Yang Daorun, as if I had known him for a long time. Because when I was in the division headquarters, I heard about his heroic deeds.
    Yang Daorun led me out of the tunnel. Following the circular trench, we looked at all kinds of shelters. Finally, he took me to his shooting position. When I asked how many enemies he had killed on this position, he took a comfort bag from one side of the fortification and handed it to me. He said: Every time he kills or wounds an enemy, he throws a small stone into this bag. I took the bag in my hand and felt it was heavy, but he said politely: "It's still far off! Even if we double the number of enemies in front of us, we still couldn't fill my bag." I carefully examined the line of small characters embroidered on the comfort bag: "Bai Guixiang, Children's Team of Xiaoxi Village, Yidu County, Hubei Province." Yang Daorun told me that this village was only a few dozen miles from his home. He said that after the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, he would take this bag filled with stones back to the motherland and give it to this child he had never met, and write on it: "Yang Daorun, a member of the Youth League of the Sixth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers."
    A signal that the enemy had been discovered came from the position, interrupting our conversation. We saw several enemies carrying things running from the mountain to their position down the mountain. I urged him urgently: "Shoot! Shoot!" But he said calmly: "Can't shoot, look how fast they run, faster than rabbits. If we shoot down this one, the other one will run far away. These are the enemies who came to deliver food, we can shoot them when they go back." I said: "Isn't it the same when they go back?" He smiled slightly and said: "Going back is uphill, they can't run even if they want to!" Looking at his calm expression, looking at his black and bright eyes, I felt even more his wisdom and bravery.
    Sure enough, in less than twenty minutes, these enemies reappeared in front of us. On the steep mountain road, they couldn't walk fast even if their lives depended on it, and they were all tired and staggering. Yang Daorun talked to me while calmly waiting for the enemy to reach the most difficult place to walk. He stretched his gun out and several deafening sounds rang out continuously beside me, followed by shouts from the observation post: "Got them! Two, three...!" I poked my head out and looked ahead. Except for one enemy who ran back in embarrassment, the rest rolled down the mountain. I regretted that one had escaped, but he said to me: "The one who went back is crippled too!" I asked: "Was he hit too?" He said: "Didn't hit him. But think about how he ran, he won't throw up blood when he gets back!" Making me laugh until my stomach hurt.
    I asked him how he had developed such good marksmanship. He told me that his hometown was in the mountainous area of Hubei, his father liked hunting very much, and he followed his father to play with guns from the age of thirteen. At that time, he "hit birds in flight" and "hit beasts on the run." He said very humorously: "At that time, I was hunting wild beasts, and now I am still hunting wild beasts. The enemies are big, much easier to hit than rabbits!"
    When we returned to the company headquarters shelter, Company Commander Wang said to me: "Yang Daorun has trained many snipers, and they shoot live targets on the position every day. The enemy doesn't dare to lift their heads on the position." Today, the regimental leaders brought the radio to the front line. We adjusted the wavelength and heard the voice of the people of the motherland broadcasting: "The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in May... annihilated 10,784 enemy troops...." I was thinking: Although there have been no major battles on the Korean battlefield in recent months, the number of enemy casualties remains very large; I calculated: If the war continues like this, how many cannon fodder can the enemy use to fill our soldiers' "comfort bags"!
    In the evening, I went to visit the artillery positions at the front line.
    This is the gun position of the "Meritorious Service Gun". A burly gunner introduced me to the history of their gun. He said: "When our gun crushed the enemy's 'Autumn Offensive' last year, we used five shells to annihilate two companies of the enemy. We caught an enemy prisoner, and his first words were: 'Your guns are too powerful! Can't stand it!'" This gunner had just returned from attending the celebration meeting. In the evening sun, I saw the "Military Medal" on his chest shining brightly. Standing on this steel position, standing beside the hero, I am proud of our heroic troops.
    When the night covered the mountains on the position and the sound of artillery was relatively sparse, a burst of singing came from our position. The soldiers lit candles in the tunnels and held a comparison and evaluation meeting for the day, recording each person's daily achievements in the merit book: "Wang Genhu group dug 2.5 meters of tunnel today... Wang Mumu killed an enemy with two shots..." But Wang Mumu was still making a self-criticism: "I shouldn't have fired two shots, wasting a bullet, I must pay attention to saving ammunition in the future." Our soldiers are carrying out their sacred duty of defending peace in such a conscientious and meticulous manner.
    Our singing reached the enemy's position, and a burst of howling and chaotic shouts came from the front line of the enemy's position. This situation reached the regimental headquarters within a minute or two. The regimental commander ordered the artillery groups on the phone: "Carry out artillery strikes on the enemy's front line. Don't allow the enemy to speak in front of us!"
    As soon as the regimental commander's voice fell, many of our cannons began firing at the same time, and groups of shells flew towards the enemy's position. In our artillery fire, the enemy's position went from burning to the flames dying down, so silent that not even half a sound could be heard.

    在阵地前沿
    张志民
    过了一座小桥，就是志愿军某部的前沿阵地。我们坐在交通壕的边沿上休息，回顾着刚刚通过的河川，这是敌人的所谓“炮火封锁地带”。在敌人炮火不断的轰炸下，桥两边的山头常常淹没在火焰里。前天的旧弹坑上今天又翻起了新土。随便你在那一个地方弯下腰来，都可以拾到生了红锈的和还带着火药味的弹皮。据说几个月以来，敌人用几个远射程的炮群专门来封锁这里的桥梁。敌人的炮兵校正机每天从天明到天黑在这里校正他们炮火的偏差。夜里，除去比白天更密集的炮火外，夜行机不论有没有目标，也要在这里投下一串串的炸弹。敌人对于封锁我们这条通向前沿的必经道路，是费尽心机、绞干脑汁的。
    但是，带我到前沿阵地来的副政治委员告诉我说：“无论敌人怎样密集的炮火，无论他投下多少炸弹，我们的桥是炸不断的。”
    我完全相信他的话，我们通向前沿的道路是决不会被敌人封锁住的；但是我不能明白，敌人的密集的炮火和轰炸为什么炸不断这样一座小小的木桥。就在这时，敌人一阵排炮在桥边爆炸了，整个河川烟尘弥漫，桥梁在炮火中不见了。我问他：“为什么炸不断呢？”
    他当时并没有回答我，只是说：“等再爬上一个山头你就明白了。”
    当我们爬上了又一个较高的山头，我回顾下面的河川，在那弯弯曲曲的水面上有着数不清的木桥，把河川划成无数小节。我正在惊奇人民部队的力量和智慧，这位副政治委员指示我看那山脚下、河川里，一处处敌机葬身的地方。离我们最近的那一架烧得焦烂的敌机的残骇，一半躺在水里，一半躺在岸上。几块比较完整的铁板，已被我们的工兵拆下来铺在桥面上了。
    顺着纵横的蛇形交通壕，我们走进了一个小小的市街，路标上用红字写着：“英雄大街”。副政治委员开玩笑地说：“这就到‘天桥’啦！你瞧多红火！”我们慢慢地走着，看着那交通壕两侧一个接一个的洞口，都用弹药箱的木板作成横匾悬在门前，上面写着：“炮兵之家”、“英雄食堂”、“英雄理发馆”、“立功洞”……到处吸引着我停下来详细地看看。这时，哨兵同志向我们招呼说：“同志，快进去，敌人要打炮了！”
    果然，我们刚刚钻进洞口，就有几发炮弹落在阵地上了。我真钦佩这位哨兵同志的机警。炮弹爆炸以后，我走到他的面前，想知道他为什么能判断得这样的准确。这位年轻的战士十分自信地告诉我：“敌人是在我手心里攒着哩！他一跷尾巴我就知道他拉什么粪蛋。”
    我们的战士是这样的勇敢、聪明、有思想、有教养，任何敌人在他们的面前都会要失败的。
    走到最前沿，什么还没来得及看，就被同志们领进一条贯通整个山梁的坑道里了。战士们把这坑道命名为“气死杜鲁门！”我们向里走了好长时间，我用手电照着路，照着两侧的墙壁，那是黑色的石质，有的地方发着红铜色。一班长蒋丙文拿过一个子弹箱请我坐下。然后，他顺手拿过一块重得像金子一样的石头给我看，并且告诉我：“这就是我们这矿里挖出的金苗。”我们都笑了。这条坑道的浩大工程，真不次于开掘一座小矿，我们的每一个战士是步兵、工兵，也是工程师。
    到了阵地的最前沿，我很想看看敌人方面的情形。我正在问这里离敌人最近的地方有多远时，一个战士从外面跑进来喊着：“有一个敌人又偷嘴吃了！”班长知道他是在说俏皮话，就故意问他：“你怎样知道呢？”这个战士又认真地说：“那个小子正挨他班长的揍哩！”我十分感到兴趣，于是马上要求他们带我出去看看，但是却没想到这个战士回答说：“看是看不到的，我是听到敌人哭了。”
    我知道我们离敌人是多么近，连敌人的哭声都可以听到；并且也知道我们守卫在这里的战士们，他们对敌人熟悉得就像自己的指掌一样。我正要问这个战士的姓名，一班长给我介绍说：“这就是我们这儿有名的猎手杨道润，敌人最怕他的眼睛，因为被他看到了就跑不脱。”最后他又加重语气地补充了一句：“我们的小英雄才十八岁呢！”
    我听到了一班长的话感到多么惊讶啊！我亲热地向杨道润打招呼，像是早已和他认识了似的。因为我在师部的时候，就听到关于他的英雄事迹。
    杨道润带我走出坑道，顺着环形交通壕我们看过各式各样的掩体，最后，他带我到他的射击位置上去。当我问到他在这个阵地上打死了多少敌人时，他从工事的一边取过一个慰问袋递给我，他说：他每打死或打伤一个敌人，就投一颗小石子在这袋子里。我把这袋子接到手里觉得沉甸甸的，可是他却客气地说：“还差得远呢！我们前边这点敌人再加上两翻也装不满我这个口袋。”我仔细地端详着慰问袋上绣的那行小字：“湖北省宜都县小溪村少年儿童队白桂香”。杨道润告诉我这个村子离他家只有几十里地，他说等抗美援朝胜利以后，他要把这装满了石子的口袋带回祖国去，给他这个未见过面的小朋友，并且在上面写上：“志愿军某部第六连青年团员杨道润”。
    阵地上传来了发现敌情的讯号，打断了我们的谈话。我们看到几个敌人背着东西从山上向山下他们的阵地跑着，我急促地催他：“打！打！”但是他却沉着地说：“打不得，你看他们跑得比兔子还快，打倒这个，那个就跑远了。这是来送饭的敌人，等他们回去的时候咱再打也不迟。”我说：“回去还不是一样跑吗？”他微微一笑说：“回去是上山，他们想跑也跑不动！”我望着他那镇静的神情，望着他那双黑得发亮的眼睛，越发感觉到他的睿智和英勇。
    果然，没有二十分钟的时间，这几个敌人又出现在我们的眼前了。那陡得像立壁一样的山路，他们要了命也走不快，一个个累得东倒西歪。杨道润一边和我拉着话，一边从容地等着敌人走到一个最难走的地方，把枪向外一伸，在我身边连续地响起几声震耳的声音，紧接着就听到观察哨上喊起来了：“揍着了！两个，三个……！”我探出头向前边望了望，除了一个敌人狼狈地跑回去了，其余都从山上滚下来了。我为着跑掉了一个而感到遗憾，可是他却对我说：“回去的那个也残废啦！”我问：“那个也打中了吗？”他说：“没有打中。但是你想他那跑劲，回去还不吐血了！”逗得我抱着肚子笑起来。
    我问他怎么练得这么一手好枪法？他告诉我说：他的家乡在湖北的山地里，他父亲很喜欢打猎，他从十三岁起就跟着父亲玩枪。那时候“打鸟打飞”、“打兽打跑”。他非常幽默地说：“那时候我就打野兽，现在还是打野兽。敌人个子大，比兔子可好打多啦！”
    我们回到连部的掩蔽部，王连长向我说：“杨道润培养了许多狙击手，天天在阵地上打活靶，敌人在阵地上已经不敢抬头了。”今天，团首长把收音机送到前沿上来，我们对好了波长，听到了祖国人民播送的声音：“朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在五月份……歼灭敌军一万零七百八十四名……。”我在想着：近几个月来朝鲜战场上虽然没有进行什么更大的战斗，然而敌人死伤的数字仍然保持很大；我计算着：战争如果这样进行下去，敌人能有多少炮灰来填我们战士的“慰问袋”呀！
    傍晚，我去参观了前沿的炮兵阵地。
    这里是“功臣号”炮的炮位，一位身材魁梧的炮手向我介绍他们这门炮的历史。他说：“我们的炮在去年粉碎敌人‘秋季攻势’的时候，用五发炮弹歼灭过敌人的两个连，我们捉住敌人的俘虏，他第一句话就说：‘你们的炮，太厉害了！受不了！’”这个炮手是刚刚参加过庆功会回来的，在傍晚的太阳下，我看到他胸前的“军功章”在闪着耀眼的光芒。我站在这钢铁的阵地上，站在英雄的身边，我为我们英雄的部队而感到骄傲。
    当夜色掩盖起阵地上的山峦、炮声比较疏稀些了的时候，从我们的阵地上传来一阵阵的歌声，战士们在坑道里点起蜡烛开着这一天的比评会，在立功簿上记下每人每天的成绩：“王根虎小组今日挖坑道两公尺五……王木木两枪打死敌人一名……”可是王木木还在作着自我检讨：“我不该打两枪，浪费了一颗子弹，今后一定要注意节省弹药。”我们的战士就是这样兢兢业业地执行着他们保卫和平的神圣职责。
    我们的歌声传到了敌人的阵地，从敌人阵地前沿传来了一阵哭嚎似的嘈杂的叫喊，这情况在一两分钟之内就传到了团指挥所，团长在电话中命令着炮群：“对敌人前沿，实行炮火袭击。不准敌人在我们面前发言！”
    团长的声音刚落，我们许多门大炮同时开始发射，炮弹一群群向敌人的阵地飞去。在我们的炮火中，敌人的阵地从燃烧到火光熄灭，死寂得连半点声音也听不到了。
