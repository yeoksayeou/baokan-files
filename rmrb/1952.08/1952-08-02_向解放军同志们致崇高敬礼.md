    Extending Our Highest Respects to the People's Liberation Army Comrades
    Respected People's Liberation Army Comrades: The great "August 1st" Army Day is here. All the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant extend our highest and warmest respects to you!
    Currently, all the workers of our plant have plunged into the upsurge of the patriotic production competition. According to preliminary statistics for July alone, our entire workforce has put forward more than 600 rationalization proposals. And the production achievements are also very considerable. For example, the coking department, in addition to overfulfilling the July production task, has increased production for the state by more than 7 billion yuan due to the close combination of technical personnel and workers, and the improvement of machinery and equipment. In the intense competition, the workers broke with conservative ideas and successfully tested the parallel operation of two blowers, providing a strong guarantee for future pig iron production. In particular, the Party Jinming group of the road transport section has achieved 500 days of safety without accidents, saving the state a lot of wealth. All the workers are actively striving to complete the glorious task of increasing production and practicing economy assigned to us by the motherland.
    With the improvement of production, the lives of our workers have also been continuously improved. More than 80% of the workers' children have entered their own primary schools. This summer vacation, more than 50 workers' children applied for junior high or high school. All workers have the opportunity to study culture and politics in their spare time. We are living a happy and fulfilling life.
    We all know that our happy life today is inseparable from your twenty-five years of arduous and heroic fighting. You are not only heroes defending the motherland, but also brave warriors defending world peace! Comrades, let us fight in different positions for the national defense and economic construction of the motherland, and fight for Asian peace and world peace!
    All workers of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

    向解放军同志们致崇高敬礼
    敬爱的解放军同志们：伟大的“八一”建军节到来了。我们石景山钢铁厂全体职工向你们致以崇高热烈的敬礼！
    目前，我厂全体职工都已卷入爱国主义生产大竞赛的热潮中。仅就七月份的初步统计，我们全体职工所提出的合理化建议已有六百多项。而生产成绩也是很可观的。如炼焦部，除了超额完成七月份的生产任务外，由于技术人员和工人的紧密结合，改进了机器设备，为国家增产七十多亿元。在紧张的竞赛中，职工们打破了保守思想，试行两个送风机并车成功，给今后的生铁产量提供了有力的保证。特别是路务股党金明小组作到了五百天安全无事故，给国家节省了不少的财富。全体职工都积极为完成祖国交给的增产节约的光荣任务而努力。
    随着生产的提高，我们职工的生活也不断地得到改善。百分之八十以上的职工子弟已进入自己的小学校。今年暑期，有五十多个职工子弟投考初中或高中。全体工人在业余时间，都有了学习文化、学习政治的机会。我们过着愉快幸福的生活。
    我们都知道，我们今天的幸福日子是和你们二十五年来艰苦的英勇的战斗分不开的。你们不仅是保卫祖国的英雄，也是保卫世界和平的英勇战士！同志们，让我们在不同的岗位上为祖国的国防建设、经济建设而奋斗吧，为亚洲和平、世界和平而奋斗！
    北京石景山钢铁厂全体职工
