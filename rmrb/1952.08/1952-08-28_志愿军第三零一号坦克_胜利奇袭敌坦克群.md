Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 27th: Our frontline reporter reported the victorious scene of the Volunteer Army armored unit's Tank No. 301 ambushing an enemy tank group in the rain, saying: One drizzly noon, Tank No. 301 received the mission to ambush an enemy tank group. After the tank commander Zhang Baolin issued the order to attack, the young tankers happily jumped into the vehicle, and the huge tank set off with a rumbling roar. Driver Wang Ansheng grasped the control lever, driving the tank nimbly over the muddy road, climbing up the slippery hillside, and reaching the firing position.

At this time, six enemy tanks appeared on the high ground not far opposite the firing position. They had been frantically shelling our forward positions every day from there. The Volunteer Army tankers had long been eyeing these enemies, and they said angrily, "We are heroic tankers, and we will not allow them to run rampant in front of our team any longer." Now they were driving their tanks to severely punish these enemies. Gunner Tang Yufeng rotated the tank gun, aiming at the foremost enemy tank; loader Yang Hongchu immediately loaded the first shell into the chamber. At this time, the tank was particularly quiet, and the tankers' eyes were focused on the shell about to be fired. After two minutes, the tank commander issued the firing command in a magnificent voice: "For the motherland, fire!" Tang Yufeng, staring at the target, pressed the button abruptly with the command. Then, a flash of fire, the tank roared. After the first test shot was fired, Tang Yufeng slightly corrected the deviation, and then fired the second shell. This shell hit the turret of an enemy tank, and the third shell hit the body of another tank. In an instant, both enemy tanks began to emit thick smoke. Tang Yufeng quickly turned the muzzle to another enemy tank. At this time, the turret of our tank was filled with gunpowder smoke, and the tankers continued to fire with towels covering their noses, firing two shots in a row, and damaging another enemy tank. The remaining enemy tanks fled in panic, causing chaos on the enemy's position. Tank No. 301 finally destroyed the enemy's forward fortifications with accurate artillery fire.

Since then, the enemy's tanks have no longer dared to rashly come out and run rampant. The soldiers of the Volunteer Army infantry unit guarding this position praised the tankers' heroic spirit and their skilled combat techniques. The infantry commander also called the command post of the armored unit to warmly congratulate Tank No. 301 on the victory of its surprise attack.

    志愿军第三零一号坦克
    胜利奇袭敌坦克群
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】本社前线记者报道志愿军装甲部队某部第三零一号坦克冒雨奇袭敌人坦克群的胜利情景说：一个细雨蒙蒙的中午，第三零一号坦克接受了奇袭敌人坦克群的任务。车长张宝林下达了出击命令以后，年青的坦克手们立刻愉快地跳进车内，巨大的坦克就带着隆隆的轰响出发了。驾驶员王安生掌握着操纵杆，驾驶着坦克敏捷地越过泥泞的道路，爬上泥滑的山坡，到达了射击阵地。
    这时在射击阵地对面不远的高地上，出现了敌人的六辆坦克，它们每天都从那里疯狂地向我军的前沿阵地打炮。志愿军坦克手们很早就瞅准了这伙敌人，他们愤恨地说：“我们是英雄的坦克手，再不准它们在我们队前逞凶。”现在他们驾着自己的坦克要来给这伙敌人狠狠地惩罚了，炮长唐玉凤转动着坦克炮，瞄准了最前边的一辆敌军坦克；装填手杨洪初立刻把第一发炮弹填进炮膛。这时坦克里特别沉静，坦克手们的眼光都集中到那颗即将射出的炮弹上。过了两分钟，车长用宏壮的声音发出了射击口令：“为了祖国、开炮！”紧盯着射击目标的唐玉凤，随着口令声把电钮猛然一按，于是火光一闪，坦克怒吼了。第一发试射的炮弹打出去以后，唐玉凤稍微修正了一下偏差，紧接着又打出了第二发炮弹。这一发炮弹正好命中一辆敌军坦克的炮塔，第三发炮弹又打中了另一辆坦克的车身，刹那间，两辆敌军坦克都冒起了浓烟。唐玉凤又迅速地将炮口转向另一辆敌军坦克。这时，我坦克的炮塔里已经充满了硝烟，坦克手们便用手巾堵着鼻子继续发射，连发两炮，又打坏了一辆敌军坦克。剩下的敌军坦克慌张地逃窜，敌人阵地上引起一片哗乱。第三零一号坦克最后又以准确的炮火摧毁了敌军阵地前沿的工事。
    从此以后，敌人的坦克再也不敢冒失地出来疯狂了。守在这个阵地上的志愿军步兵部队的战士们，纷纷赞扬坦克手们的英勇精神和他们的熟练的作战技术。步兵指挥员，也打电话给装甲部队的指挥所，热烈祝贺第三零一号战车进行奇袭的胜利。
