    Some Technicians Disregard Advanced Soviet Technology

    Editor:
    In the past, the Jingxing Coal Mine was operated by imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. Therefore, the mine's machinery and equipment were mostly products of imperialist countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan. Some technicians were also deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology. After liberation, some technicians in the mine have consistently adopted a resistant attitude towards advanced Soviet-made production tools such as pneumatic picks and coal cutting machines.

    When Soviet machines were first used, the workers' unfamiliarity with operating techniques affected the machines' performance. The technicians then confidently said, "Soviet machines are not good." In fact, are Soviet pneumatic picks and coal cutting machines good or not? Can they be used? The answer has been found in the current upsurge of the whole mine's workers finding solutions. For example, technician Zhang Yamin inspected eight Soviet pneumatic picks that had been discarded in the warehouse for eight months, which he previously considered unusable. He discovered that the pneumatic picks that could not be rotated in the past could be turned into very useful pneumatic picks simply by polishing the intake and exhaust ports, and the production efficiency was much higher than that of products from imperialist countries such as Britain and the United States. Some people said, "Soviet coal cutting machines overheat and cannot be used," but this is also groundless. Soviet coal cutting machines can withstand heat up to about 80 to 100 degrees Celsius.

    The above facts illustrate a problem: these technicians have been poisoned by bourgeois ideology. They do not understand or study the operating efficiency of Soviet machines, and blindly resist, saying that "Soviet machines are not good." This is because they do not understand that true science and technology can only be fully developed and utilized in socialist countries.

### 某些技术人员漠视苏联先进技术

    某些技术人员漠视苏联先进技术
    编辑同志：过去井陉煤矿是帝国主义和官僚资本主义所经营的。所以矿上机器设备多是英、美、德、日等帝国主义国家的产品，有些技术人员受资产阶级思想影响也较深。解放后，该矿有些技术人员对苏联出产的先进生产工具——风镐和割煤机等，一直是采取了抵抗态度。
    在开始使用苏联机器时，因为工人操作技术不熟练，也就影响了机器效能的发挥。技术人员便振振有辞地说“苏联的机器不好”。其实苏联的风镐和割煤机究竟好不好？能不能使用？在这次全矿职工找窍门的热潮中，已经得到解答。如技术员张亚民把过去认为不能使用丢在仓库内已经八个月的八台苏联风镐检查了一次，发觉了过去不能转的风镐只要把进出风瓦拉口稍加磨光，就能变成了很好使的风镐，而且生产效力比英、美等帝国主义国家的产品高得多。有人说“苏联割煤机发热，不能使用”，其实也是毫无根据的，苏联割煤机可以耐热达摄氏八十度到一百度左右。
    以上事实说明了一个问题，就是这些技术人员中了资产阶级思想的毒。他们不懂得、也不研究苏联机器的操作效能，就盲目地抵抗，说“苏联机器不好”。这是因为他们不了解真正的科学和技术，只有在社会主义国家里才能得到充分的发挥和运用。
