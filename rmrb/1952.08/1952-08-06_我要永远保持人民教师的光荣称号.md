    I Want to Forever Maintain the Glorious Title of People's Teacher
    Editor: I was born into a poor peasant family and only attended school for four years as a child. I worked as a hired laborer and a shop assistant, enduring all kinds of oppression. I remember once being beaten by the shopkeeper for writing and doing calculations. He said, "Who told you to write and learn to calculate! Isn't that delaying my work?" I was fired because of this.
    After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, I joined a revolutionary organization. Several Communist Party members warmly helped me and introduced me to a military and political cadre school to study. I experienced the warmth of humanity for the first time. From then on, I knew who was oppressing us and understood who I should love and who I should hate. I understood even more that we must follow the Communist Party to be liberated.
    Under the education of the Party, I transformed from a hired laborer with only a rudimentary knowledge of literacy into a middle school teacher. I have been full of confidence in my work, and I have never felt tired. I carefully study every teaching problem to stimulate the students' awareness and initiative, develop their creative abilities, and cultivate their revolutionary qualities of loving the motherland, loving Chairman Mao, and hating the enemy.
    Whenever I think of these promising young students, I am truly overjoyed. They are growing up day by day. Some have gone on to specialized schools, some have taken up jobs, and some have joined the Chinese People's Volunteers, becoming glorious soldiers. They often write to me saying: Teacher, congratulate us! We are contributing everything we have to the construction of the motherland. Some students have gloriously joined the Party. When I think of them, I can't help but cheer for their bright future. For a happy tomorrow, I will work selflessly. I will use the greatest determination to study hard and contribute all my strength to the cultural and educational cause of the motherland. Under the education of the Party, I want to forever maintain the glorious title of People's Teacher.

    我要永远保持人民教师的光荣称号
    编辑同志：我出身于一个贫农家庭，小时候只念了四年书。我当过揽工和店员，受尽了欺压。记得有一次因为我写字、演算，被掌柜打了一顿，他说：“谁叫你写字学演算！这样不是耽误了我的活吗？”我因此被开除。
    抗日战争开始以后，我参加了革命的团体，几位共产党员热情地帮助我，介绍我入军政干部学校学习，我第一次体会到人间的温暖。我从此知道谁压迫我们，懂得了应该爱谁，应该恨谁。我更懂得我们要解放，只有跟着共产党走。
    在党的教育下，我由一个粗通文字的揽工变成了一个中学教师，我对我的工作是满怀信心的，我从来没有疲倦过，我细心研究每一个教学的问题，来启发同学的自觉性和积极性，发挥他们的创造能力，培养他们热爱祖国、热爱毛主席，仇恨敌人的革命品质。
    每当想起这些年青有为的学生的时候，我真乐不可支。他们一天天成长着，有的升入专科学校，有的走上了工作岗位，有的参加了人民志愿军，成为光荣的战士。他们常常写信给我说：老师，为我们祝贺罢！我们正在为祖国的建设事业贡献我们的一切。有些同学已光荣地入党了。我一想起他们，我不禁为他们的远大前程而欢呼。为了幸福的明天，我一定忘我地工作。我要用最大的决心去努力学习，为祖国的文化教育事业贡献出一切力量。在党的教育下，我要永远保持人民教师的光荣称号。  韩民英
