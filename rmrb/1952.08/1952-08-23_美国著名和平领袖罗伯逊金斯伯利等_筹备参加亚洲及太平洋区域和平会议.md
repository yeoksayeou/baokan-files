    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch from New York: American peace advocates are actively preparing to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing in September. Prominent American peace leader Robertson and Kingsbury, the American representative who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, recently sent a telegram to the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, saying: "We will do everything in our power to promote American participation in the peace conference."
    Upon returning to the United States, Kingsbury spoke to a reporter from the New York Compass on August 7 about the achievements of the preparatory meeting for the peace conference. He pointed out that the spirit of focusing on discussion and reconciling different opinions at the preparatory meeting left him with a particularly deep impression. Those presiding over the meeting waited until the representatives had spoken and opposing opinions had been fully debated and approached agreement before proceeding to a vote. In addition, he also expressed his praise for China's massive construction projects and the new life of the people.

    筹备参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【新华社二十二日讯】纽约消息：美国和平人士正在积极准备参加九月间在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。美国著名和平领袖罗伯逊和出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的美国代表金斯伯利，最近致电亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会说：“我们将尽一切力量促成美国参加和平会议。”
    金斯伯利在返抵美国后，曾在八月七日向纽约指南针日报记者畅谈和平会议筹备会议的成就，他指出筹备会议中那种着重讨论和调和不同意见的精神，使他获得特别深刻的印象。主持会议的人都等到代表们发了言，并且相反的意见得到充分的辩论和接近协议时，才进行表决。此外，他还对中国的巨大建设工程和人民的新生活表示了赞扬。
