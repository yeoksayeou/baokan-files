The first and second volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" have been published in Japan, divided into four volumes. The Japanese version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is translated by the Mao Zedong Selected Works Publication Association, composed of Japanese progressive cultural workers, and published by "San-Ichi Shobo". The Japanese people, who are struggling for national liberation and democratic peace, urgently need to learn from the experience of the Chinese people's revolution. Soon after the publication of the first volume of the Japanese version of Selected Works of Mao Zedong on February 10th this year, the Japanese people enthusiastically began studying the Selected Works of Mao Zedong.

The "Mao Zedong Selected Works Popularization Association" held six consecutive "Mao Zedong Selected Works Lectures" every Saturday at the Sanbetsu Kaikan in Tokyo, starting from February 16th. Hirano Yoshitaro, Iwamura Michio, and others served as lecturers, and the audience was very crowded each time. The branches of the Japan-China Friendship Association in Osaka and Kyoto, and "San-Ichi Shobo", held "China Night" evenings at the Labor Hall in Kyoto on March 12th and at the Central Public Hall in Osaka on March 14th to celebrate the publication of the Japanese version of Selected Works of Mao Zedong. The scenes in both places were unprecedented, with 4,000 people attending the evening in Osaka. In late April, Kyoto and Osaka also held "Mao Zedong Selected Works Study Lectures" separately.

The publication of the Japanese version of Selected Works of Mao Zedong was widely circulated among the broad masses of the Japanese people as a major event. Many factories and schools organized "Mao Zedong Selected Works Reading Groups" and "Mao Zedong Selected Works Research Groups" to study. People actively participated in "Lectures on Mao Zedong Thought" held in various places. A worker in Shizuoka Prefecture said after reading Selected Works of Mao Zedong:

"Selected Works of Mao Zedong is truly amazing. It is such an easy-to-understand and content-rich theoretical book! We are all very distressed now. In order to break through this distress, the Selected Works of Mao Zedong must be published early and in large quantities. We must launch activities to popularize the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, make every copy of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong play a role, and make Mao Zedong Thought the possession of the Japanese people." Many school students held "Lectures on Mao Zedong Thought". The China Research Society of Tokyo University held seven "Lectures on Mao Zedong Thought" from May 30th to June 21st. Each time the venue was crowded with thousands of listeners, and the audience increased each time.

The plain language and rich content of Selected Works of Mao Zedong have been unanimously loved and respected by the broad masses of the Japanese people. Today, people from all walks of life can be seen diligently reading Selected Works of Mao Zedong everywhere in Japan.
