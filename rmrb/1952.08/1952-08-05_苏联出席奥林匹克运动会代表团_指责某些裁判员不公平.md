Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 2nd. The head of the Soviet sports delegation to the 15th International Olympic Games in Finland, Romanov, published a statement in the Finnish press, pointing out that some referees and referee committees at the Games had been judging incorrectly and unfairly. Romanov said: Finnish newspapers have repeatedly pointed out the main shortcomings in the work of some referees and referee committees. However, the correct opinions of the Finnish newspapers have not received sufficient attention, as required by the spirit of sportsmanship and the traditions of the Olympic Games. On the contrary, new serious errors have recently occurred. Romanov cited specific instances of incorrect and unfair refereeing, which occurred in various competitions, including equestrian events, women's diving, boxing, wrestling, gymnastics, etc. It can be seen from Romanov's statement that some referees and referee committees deliberately lowered the scores of athletes from the Soviet Union and some other countries, while intentionally and unfairly increasing the scores of athletes from certain countries. Romanov emphasized that although the main referee committee of the Games sometimes acknowledged the mistakes made by the referees, it did not take any measures to correct the situation. Romanov finally expressed regret over the fact that the leaders of some sports delegations were able to exert pressure on the referee committee of the Games. The statement said: This situation is not in accordance with the spirit of the Olympic Games. We believe that the Olympic Committee will do its best to ensure that the referee committee maintains honesty and fairness during the Olympic Games.

    苏联出席奥林匹克运动会代表团
    指责某些裁判员不公平
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：现在芬兰参加第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的苏联体育代表团团长罗曼诺夫在芬兰报上发表声明，指出运动会上有些裁判员和裁判委员会裁判不正确、不客观的情事。罗曼诺夫说：芬兰报纸曾一再指出某些裁判员和裁判委员会的工作中的主要缺点。然而，芬兰报纸的正确意见并没有受到充分的注意，像体育竞赛应有的诚实精神和奥林匹克运动会的传统所要求的那样，相反地最近又发生了新的严重错误。罗曼诺夫举出一些裁判不正确、不客观的具体事实，这些事情发生在各种比赛中，包括赛马、女子跳水、拳击、角力、机巧运动等等。从罗曼诺夫的声明中可以看出：有些裁判员和裁判委员会故意减低苏联及一些其他国家的运动员的成绩，同时有意不公允地提高某些国家运动员的成绩。罗曼诺夫强调说：有些时候大会总裁判委员会虽然承认了裁判员所犯的错误，但是并未采取任何措施纠正这种情况。罗曼诺夫最后对于某些体育代表团的领导人居然能够对运动会裁判委员会使用压力这一事实表示遗憾。声明中说：这种情况是不符合奥林匹克运动会的精神的。我们相信：奥林匹克委员会将尽力使裁判委员会在奥林匹克运动会期间保持诚实和公正。
