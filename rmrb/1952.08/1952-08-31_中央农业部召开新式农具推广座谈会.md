    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened a symposium on the promotion of new agricultural tools from August 20th to 26th. After summarizing the work of promoting new agricultural tools in the first half of this year, the meeting determined that it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership, implement a steady development policy, enrich and improve agricultural tool promotion agencies, train cadres, strengthen publicity and demonstration, and organize technical instruction in the future. During the autumn and winter plowing season this year, efforts will be made to vigorously promote new-style walking plows in order to strive for a bumper harvest next year.
    Regarding the promotion of new agricultural tools in the first half of this year, only the Northeast region completed more than half of its annual plan, and Chahar Province approached half of its annual plan. Most other regions performed poorly, with some completing only a quarter or even a tenth of their annual plan. Although some regions promoted a large number of new agricultural tools, they did not teach farmers how to use them, or the quality of the tools was too poor, resulting in no effect. A small factory in Zhengzhou produced shoddy products and made walking plows that could not be used, which seriously affected farmers' confidence in new agricultural tools and hindered the development of promotion work. The meeting pointed out that the above situation is mainly due to the lack of clear thinking among local leading cadres, the lack of planning in promotion work; the neglect or weakening of technical guidance to farmers after most regions merged their original agricultural tool stations into cooperatives or other agencies; and the lack of responsibility in various regions for supervising the production of new agricultural tools, resulting in shoddy workmanship and many losses. Given the great development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement today, and the greatly improved supply capacity of new agricultural tools, all regions should actively overcome the shortcomings in their past work to meet the needs and demands of farmers for adopting new agricultural tools and increasing yield per unit area.

    中央农业部召开新式农具推广座谈会
    中央人民政府农业部于八月二十日到二十六日，召开了新式农具推广座谈会。会议对今年上半年推广新式农具工作进行总结后，确定今后必须加强思想领导，贯彻稳步发展方针，充实和健全农具推广机构，培养干部，加强宣传示范和组织技术传授工作，在今年秋耕冬耕期间大力推广新式步犁，以争取明年丰产。
    今年上半年推广新式农具工作，只有东北完成全年计划一半以上，察哈尔省接近全年计划的半数，其他地区大部做得很差，有的仅完成全年计划的四分之一甚至十分之一。有些地区推广新式农具的数量虽多，却没有教会农民怎样使用，或是农具质量太差，结果不起作用。郑州一家小工厂粗制滥造，造出的步犁不能使用，严重地影响了农民对新式农具的信心，阻碍了推广工作的开展。会议指出：上述情况，主要是各地领导干部思想不明确。推广工作缺乏计划性；大部分地区把原有的农具站合并到合作社或其他机关后，忽视了或削弱了对农民的技术指导；以及各地对监制新式农具工作不够负责，造成粗制滥造，损失很多。在今天农业生产互助合作运动已有很大发展，新式农具供应能力也已大大提高的情况下，各地应积极克服过去工作中的缺点，以满足农民对采用新式农具，提高单位面积产量的需要和要求。（新华社）
