In accordance with the basic spirit of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on national policy, national democratic united governments may be established in the following regions: (1) Provinces (administrative offices), cities, special districts, counties, districts, and townships (villages) where the Han population constitutes an absolute majority, but the minority nationality population accounts for more than 10% of the total population; (2) Provinces (administrative offices), cities, special districts, counties, districts, and townships (villages) where the minority nationality population does not reach 10% of the total population, but the national relations are significant and have a multifaceted impact on administration; (3) Areas where two or more minority nationalities live together, but have not implemented joint autonomy; (4) Areas within national autonomous regions where there are particularly large numbers of Han residents; (5) Other areas where, due to special circumstances, the establishment of national democratic united governments is deemed necessary by the Greater Administrative Region People's Government or the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

The purpose of establishing local national democratic united governments is to guarantee the equal rights of minority nationalities in local political power. As for the title of People's Government, it is not necessary to change it for this reason.

All national democratic united governments are a level of local political power. Regarding the organization of the People's Representative Conference and the People's Government of the national democratic united government, in addition to generally applying the "Organizational Rules for People's Representative Conferences of All Circles at the Provincial, Municipal, County, District, and Township (Village) Levels" and the "Organizational Rules for People's Governments at the Provincial, Municipal, County, District, and Township (Village) Levels" promulgated by the Central People's Government, the following supplementary provisions are specifically made:

I. On the People's Representative Conference

(1) The number of representatives of each nationality in the People's Representative Conference shall be based on the population ratio of each nationality, and shall be appropriately stipulated and allocated through consultation. Appropriate consideration should be given to nationalities with particularly small populations.

(2) The representatives of each nationality in the People's Representative Conference may be separately elected by the people of each nationality, or may be jointly elected by the people of each nationality, depending on the specific circumstances of local national relations.

(3) The number of members and candidates of the consultation committee or standing committee of the People's Representative Conference must be fully consulted, and attention should be paid to taking care of nationalities with smaller populations.

The chairman of the consultation committee and the standing committee may increase the number of deputy positions depending on the local national situation.

(4) Representatives of all nationalities have the right to use their own national language and script in the People's Representative Conference and the consultation committee or standing committee of the People's Representative Conference. Important reports, documents, and speeches in the meeting should be translated into the languages of the nationalities participating in the meeting as much as possible, or interpreters should be provided for oral translation.

(5) The People's Representative Conference shall attach the same importance to the proposals and opinions of minority nationality representatives as to the proposals and opinions of other representatives. Special issues related to a certain minority nationality must be fully consulted with the representatives of that minority nationality and agreed upon before a decision is made.

II. On the People's Government

(1) The number of members and candidates of the People's Government Committee must be fully consulted, and attention should be paid to taking care of nationalities with smaller populations.

The head of the People's Government may increase the number of deputy positions depending on the local national situation.

(2) The People's Government Committee should respect the powers and functions of minority nationality members, and should conduct full consultations with minority nationality members, especially on issues related to minority nationalities.

(3) All departments of the People's Government should pay attention to absorbing cadres of minority nationalities to participate in the work, enthusiastically help them, and take care of their living habits.

(4) The People's Government should use the languages of all local nationalities as much as possible when exercising its functions.

(5) The People's Government should promote national regional autonomy in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities in accordance with the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China."

(6) The People's Government shall effectively guarantee the equal rights of all nationalities within its jurisdiction, educate the people of all nationalities to respect each other's customs and religious beliefs, promote unity and mutual assistance between nationalities, and prohibit discrimination and oppression between nationalities and any acts that incite national disputes.

(7) Within the scope stipulated by the laws and regulations of the Central People's Government and the higher-level People's Government, the People's Government may formulate separate regulations suitable for the situation of all nationalities within its jurisdiction, and report them to the two higher-level People's Governments for approval. All separate regulations approved by local People's Governments at all levels must be reported to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for the record.
