Without thorough surveying and investigation, there can be no design and construction.

    A Profound Lesson
    By Wang Juqian, Deputy Director of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, Central People's Government

    The construction of new railway lines is a complex and meticulous task. Accurate and complete designs are essential for construction, but design work cannot be done well without precise surveys and reconnaissance. The construction of a certain forest railway in the Northeast forest region illustrates this point.

    The preliminary survey work for a certain forest railway in Northeast China was carried out in 1950 by the Forest Survey Team of the Inner Mongolia Forestry Bureau. At that time, it was the rainy season, the roads were muddy, and the line of sight was blocked by dense trees. Therefore, the preliminary survey did not involve detailed investigation and research. Later, no preliminary survey was conducted, and the final survey was carried out from September to November of last year. Moreover, during the final survey, they initially encountered heavy floods; later, due to the cold, the ground froze, and even wooden stakes could not be driven in. Therefore, they only measured a comparative line on the section across the watershed, and did not conduct precise research on the overall line design standards, roadbed geology, and line selection. In April of this year, when the engineering department organized by the Ministry of Railways went to start construction, the construction personnel found that the originally measured route was inappropriate and that 80% of it needed to be re-measured. However, in order not to affect this year's timber supply plan and to ensure the completion of traffic by November, it was decided to adopt a policy of designing and constructing simultaneously. Construction began on June 1. After the start of construction, many unexpected difficulties were encountered.

    First of all, in terms of the roadbed, because the characteristics of swampy areas and permafrost layers were not considered when selecting the route, and only the measurement method for ordinary areas was used - selecting straight lines and flat ground, it was discovered during construction that the roadbed geology was poor. Because the surface of the geological features in swampy areas in forest regions is *tata* (*tata* is a special type of grass in the forest, with interwoven roots up to four or five *cun* high, with a typical distance of three or four *cun* between plants, with water accumulating in the lower part and thin leaves spreading out at the top, the surface resembling a grassland). Underneath the *tata* is humus soil, and then yellow clay or mud and gravel. This kind of soil freezes into one piece in winter and turns into mud in summer. This creates difficulties in excavating the soil. If a roadbed is filled on such soil, the roadbed will naturally not be stable, and coupled with the poor quality of the fill and poor workmanship, the roadbed will become soft. If this situation had been studied during the reconnaissance, and the line had been selected near the mountainous area, although the amount of earthwork would have increased, the humus layer in the mountainous area would have been easily removed, and good soil could have been obtained during filling, thus ensuring the quality of the roadbed. The quality of the roadbeds that have already been made is very poor. If they are rebuilt, the loss will be great; if they are not rebuilt, a large amount of ballast will still be needed every year in the future, which is also a waste.

    Secondly, in terms of bridges and culverts, the geological formation of the foundations was not well drilled during the survey, and the depth of the permafrost layer was not understood, nor was the situation after thawing understood, and no research was done on construction methods, so it was decided to drive piles. During construction, we prepared many 750-kilogram core hammers, preparing to drive piles according to ordinary circumstances. However, the wooden piles could not be driven into the two-meter permafrost layer. Because that is permanent permafrost. These are all situations that had not been anticipated before. Now we have to re-study the depth of the permafrost layer, re-design, and decide on construction methods.

    Originally, in order to open the traffic as soon as possible and not affect this year's timber supply plan, it was decided to plan and construct simultaneously. However, the facts prove that construction without thorough reconnaissance and investigation not only cannot open the traffic early, but also leads to poor project quality and wastes manpower and financial resources.

### 一个深刻的教训

专栏：没有周密的勘察和调查就不能设计和施工

    一个深刻的教训
    中央人民政府铁道部工程总局副局长  汪菊潜
    铁路新线的建设是很复杂而细致的工作。没有准确而完备的设计固然不能施工，但没有精密的调查和勘测，设计工作也做不好。东北森林区某森林铁路的建设就说明了这个问题。
    东北某森林铁路的草测工作是一九五○年由内蒙林业总局森林调查队做的。那时候，正是雨季，道路泥泞，同时视线被茂密的树木挡住，因此，在草测的时候，没有做详细的调查研究工作。后来，也没有做初测工作，就于去年九月到十一月做了定测工作。而且在做定测工作的时候，起初遇着大水，一片汪洋；以后因为寒冷，地面冻结了，连木桩也打不下去。因此仅仅在过分水岭的一段测了比较线，对于整个线路设计标准、路基地质和线路选择等，都没有精密地加以研究。今年四月中央铁道部组织工程处前去施工时，施工人员发觉原测的路线不妥当，有百分之八十需要改测。但为了不影响今年木材的供应计划，保证十一月完成通车任务，仍决定采取一边设计一边施工的方针。遂于六月一日开工。开工以后，就遇到了很多意想不到的困难。
    首先，在路基方面，由于在选线时没有考虑到湿原地区和冻层的特点，只按普通地区的测定法——选定直线和走平地。所以，施工时就发现路基地质不好。因为森林地区湿原地带的地质的表皮是塔头（塔头为森林里的特殊草类，草根盘结高达四、五公寸，株与株之间，普通距离三、四公寸，下部积水，上部细叶分披，表面如同一片草地）。塔头下面是腐植土，再下就是黄胶土或者是泥和碎石。这样的土质，在冬季冻成一片，在夏季就变成泥浆。这就造成挖土的困难。在这样的土质上填筑路基，路基自然不会稳固，加上填方的土质不好，工作不良，就造成路基松软。如果在勘测时研究了这种情况，把线路选在靠山地区，虽然增加一些土方数量，但山地的腐植土层容易去掉，在填土时也能取得好土，路基的质量就可以得到保证。现在已做成的路基的质量都很差。如果返工重筑，损失很大；如果不返工重筑，将来每年还需要大量的石碴，也是浪费。
    其次，在桥涵方面，勘察时没有很好钻探，不了解基础地质冻层的深度，不了解解冻以后的情况，也不研究施工方法，就决定了打桩。施工时，我们按照普通的情况，准备了很多七百五十公斤的穿心锤，准备打桩。但是，打木桩打到二公尺冻层时就打不下去了。因为那是永久冻层。这都是以前没有想到的情况。现在只好重新研究冻层深度，重新设计和决定施工方法。
    本来，为了早日通车，不影响今年木材的供应计划，因此决定一边计划一边施工，但是，事实证明在没有周密的勘测和调查以前就施工，这样的做法，不仅不能早日通车，并且造成工程质量不好，造成人力财力的浪费。
