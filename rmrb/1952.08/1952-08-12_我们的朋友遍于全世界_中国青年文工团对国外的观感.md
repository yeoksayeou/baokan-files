    Our Friends Are All Over the World
    ——Observations of the China Youth Art Troupe on Foreign Countries
    ZI Gang
    The China Youth Art Troupe went abroad on July 16 last year to participate in the Third World Youth and Students Peace Festival in Berlin. Since then, it has traveled through nine countries: the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Albania. It has visited 140 cities, with a total of 418 performances and approximately 2.3 million audience members (the numbers only cover eight countries, as the part of the troupe that performed in Albania has not yet returned). Most of the troupe members returned to Beijing on July 25. They are now summarizing their work from the past year, conducting artistic rectification and study, and researching the artistic advantages of various fraternal countries for reference and learning. Zhou Weizhi, the head of the troupe, Ren Hong, the deputy head, and the main responsible comrades of various departments within the troupe, also expressed their observations on foreign countries at a recent summary discussion. The following are the main points of their speeches.
    In Europe, there is a saying: Dresden is a glittering pearl on the Elbe River, famous in Europe for its arts and crafts; Budapest is a flower on the Danube River, with beautiful geography and culture. However, Dresden was狂炸狂炸狂炸bombed several times by the U.S. military during the liberation war, resulting in 300,000 casualties, and the beautiful city was turned into ruins. As for Budapest, when the Soviet army liberated it, Comrade Stalin ordered the Soviet army not to destroy it and not to use heavy weapons. In the case of using only light weapons, the Soviet army paid a heavy price in lives to preserve this flower on the Danube. After completing the Three-Year Plan, Hungary is now carrying out the Five-Year Plan, with steel mills being built and the subway under construction. Dresden is also being rebuilt on the ruins. The government of the German Democratic Republic has allocated huge sums of money to rebuild the "pearl" to restore its radiance, rebuilding a famous palace to its original appearance, striving to ensure the carvings remain unchanged. An old professor is also working tirelessly, believing that after this reconstruction, it will never be destroyed again because he has confidence in defending world peace. With the selfless help of the Soviet Union, the industrial and cultural construction of the German Democratic Republic are advancing simultaneously. The Soviet Union has not held the German people accountable for the terrible disasters that German fascism inflicted on it.
    All the comrades of the China Youth Art Troupe participated in a day of voluntary labor in Dresden, which was very educational. The troupe members found many living and labor tools on the ruins: cradle frames, pots, ladles... They deeply realized how many happy families had been buried under the rubble and how strong the people's demand for a peaceful and beautiful life was. In those buildings in Germany that had been battered by artillery fire, the presence of flower pots on the windows indicated that people lived inside. Theaters and opera houses have sprung up, and music has been revived among the people. The working people welcome international friends by overfulfilling production plans.
    Warsaw, Poland, this indomitable city, has become beautiful again; it is still being built according to plan, to build itself into a brand new city. Peace-loving people yearn for communist construction. In the concentration camps and killing factories established by the Hitler bandits, there are displays of soap made from human fat, cloth woven from human hair, and piles of knocked-out human teeth. This fully demonstrates the beastly nature of fascism. The person leading the tour is a survivor of the concentration camp. He tells the visitors more than once: Please do not look at these places as if you were in a museum. We, the living, must fulfill the unfinished wishes of the dead! German fascism also invented a light that would cause young girls to age rapidly when exposed to it. What a catastrophe Poland has gone through! But today, Poland is striving to restore all the fine cultural traditions, and even Chopin's home has been repaired.
    With the assistance of the Soviet Union, Romania is opening a canal that will turn many deserts into fertile fields and connect the Danube River with the Black Sea. Water transport will make the lives of the Romanian people happier. The Soviet Union not only provides machinery for opening the river, but also helps Romania train cadres. When the Youth Art Troupe performed in Bucharest, they met a worker on a mountain who presented flowers to the Chinese friends, reciting poetic sentences, asking them to take back the Romanian workers' respect for the Chinese worker comrades. When he received a badge of Chairman Mao, he kissed it again and again. The play "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" is about to be staged in Romania.
    The workers in Bulgaria can name the leaders of every fraternal country. They call the most modernized factory completed with Soviet assistance "the crystallization of Soviet-Bulgarian friendship." They are gathering several rivers to build power stations, building their pink factory buildings on green grass. When the Bulgarian people raised cold-weather clothing for the Korean people, many people took off their clothes on the spot. Everyone recognizes this truth: the struggle of peace-loving people around the world is consistent. The Bulgarian people say: Although we only have seven million people, we are still powerful, because the total population of China and Bulgaria is 507 million!
    The Czechoslovak people also said: Your resistance to America and aid to Korea is to protect our construction, so the comrades from the Chinese People's Volunteers in the art troupe are most welcome. Czechoslovakia has performed "The White-Haired Girl" and will also perform "Liu Hulan." They also requested that we continue to introduce good Chinese plays. Minister of Propaganda and Culture of the Czech Republic, Kopecky, praised China greatly after returning from China, saying that he had crossed the Yangtze River five times.
    In the people's democratic countries, some of Chairman Mao's works have been translated, and the Weimar Theater regards "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as required reading. Military schools in Romania and Bulgaria also study Chinese military experience. In the "Soldiers' Home" in Bulgaria, soldiers learn "traveling in front of the map," naming the leaders and national conditions of each country according to the country name, and hanging photos of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and the slogan "Learn from China's military experience."
    The Eastern European people's democratic countries are very concerned about our "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and artistic rectification and study. They know that this will speed up China's construction work. They admire the great ideological transformation movement carried out by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao.
    The situation in Austria is different. Ordinary petty citizens have a timidity like cicadas under the rule of the U.S. military and the reactionary government. The theater manager who contacted our art troupe for performances initially shook hands with our comrades with three fingers, and at the same time looked at his watch and said: He only has five minutes to talk. But after our art troupe performed many times, he changed his attitude, praising the performance program as the best and most popular program in their theater in the past twenty years. Many audience members came to the stage to present various gifts at the end of our performance. An old lady wanted to give her gold bracelet to Wang Kun, who played Xi'er in "The White-Haired Girl," hugged her and kissed her, saying that she herself had a life similar to Xi'er. A working-class mother and daughter watched the performance five times in a row and also came to give gifts. When they received a badge of Chairman Mao, they were so moved that they cried.
    The people of Austria are brave. When the China Youth Art Troupe was there, they held a rally of 20,000 people in front of the reactionary Vienna City Hall. At the meeting, a telegram was passed to pay tribute to the Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong, and the masses shouted "Yankee Go Home." China's friends are truly all over the world. When the progressive people of Austria talked with the members of our art troupe, they called their reactionary rulers "they" and called the Chinese people and themselves "we."
    Austria is a country with musical traditions. Mozart and Beethoven spent their long musical creation life in Vienna. But today, a Vienna opera house has not been completed after seven years of construction. The building frames are about to rot, and the reactionary city government says there is no money to repair it. The money has been used to build American barracks and cafes. The people want to repair Mozart's hometown house, but the government does not repair it. Now the house has been bought by Italian businessmen to build an insurance company. The reactionary rulers turned the former residence of musicians into a stable without regret. Compared with the situation in the German Democratic Republic, which repaired Goethe's hometown of Weimar and protected the poet's former residence as if protecting their eyes, what a stark contrast! This fully demonstrates the superiority of moving towards socialism and the people's democratic system.
    Today, Austria's excellent musical tradition is suffering doom. The musicians without integrity have long been taken away by the United States, while those who remain live a hard life. Orchestra workers have to work twelve hours a day, and music professors who teach many classes still have difficulty living, with torn clothes and broken shoes. Many musicians have become "beggar singers" wandering on the streets. A large-scale drama school only has more than 50 students, and most of them are foreign students. The desolate situation of Austrian stores is unique among the countries the art troupe has traveled through.
    The Eastern European people's democratic countries all believe that their friendship with China is inseparable from their friendship with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has assisted them with human blood and life, and is now doing its best to help them build. Many countries have established Stalin cities. When our art troupe sang "Ode to Stalin," the audience expressed their resonance with applause and cheers. Zhdanov's guiding ideology on literature and art is popularized in various countries.
    When the art troupe arrived in the Soviet Union, many comrades were so excited about the new things they encountered that they couldn't sleep. Everyone thought that Moscow could be regarded as the most beautiful city in the world, but this city is now becoming more beautiful. A huge urban reconstruction plan is being implemented. In addition to the completion of the 34-story Moscow University building, new giant buildings are being built along the river. The Moscow subway, which no capitalist country can imitate, has completed the third underground ring railway this year. Each station is magnificent, as luxurious as a palace. They also personally witnessed some of the scenes of the great communist construction: the tractor production averages one every quarter of an hour; in the coldest days, huge greenhouses are blooming with flowers. From Kiev to Irkutsk, from Ukraine to Siberia, the most elaborate theaters and cultural palaces have been established everywhere, and everywhere there are popular people's actors and Stalin Prize winners loved by the masses. The Soviet people are very concerned about the construction of various fraternal countries. When the art troupe visited a factory, they were deeply moved to see a workshop dedicated to producing goods ordered by China.
    The countries believe that the successful programs of our art troupe are the result of implementing Mao Zedong's line of literature and art; they believe that we have inherited the excellent cultural traditions of ancient times, and the respect for the progressive culture and art of various countries has also left a deep impression on the people of various countries. The artistic forms are rich and diverse; many programs reflect real life and struggle, and are full of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary optimism.
    At the festival, in addition to performing programs many times, our art troupe also participated in the literary and artistic program competition. Dances such as "San Cha Kou" and "Red Silk Dance" won the collective first prize; Qu Xixian's composition "The Hearts of People All Over the World are One" won the second prize in the composition competition; in the solo singing competition, Li Zhishu won the second prize, and Zheng Xingli and Liu Yanping won the Excellent Performance Award; Han Zhongjie won the third prize for flute solo, Zhou Guangren won the third prize for piano solo, and Yang Bingsun's violin won the Excellent Performance Award; the acrobatics team in the art troupe won the "Best Performer at the Festival" award. The people of various fraternal countries called our art troupe "envoys of peace," "inheritors of five thousand years of outstanding culture," and "propagators of new Chinese culture."
    The China Youth Art Troupe traveled to these countries this time to promote and learn from the people of various countries, especially with a further understanding of defending peace. What is peace? In the words of the members of the Youth Art Troupe, it is: cultural palaces, nurseries, gardens, schools, factories, farms, canals, and even painless childbirth.
    Build them and defend them!

    我们的朋友遍于全世界
    ——中国青年文工团对国外的观感
    子冈
    中国青年文工团去年七月十六日出国参加在柏林举行的第三届世界青年和学生和平联欢节，此后遍经民主德国、匈牙利、波兰、苏联、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、奥地利、阿尔巴尼亚九个国家，到过一百四十个城市，共演出四百一十八场，观众约二百三十万人（去阿尔巴尼亚演出的一部分团员还没回来，所以数字只就八个国家统计）。大部分团员在七月二十五日回到了北京。他们正在总结一年来的工作，进行文艺整风学习，研究各兄弟国家的艺术的优点，以便借鉴和学习。该团团长周巍峙、副团长任虹以及团内各部门主要负责同志并在最近的总结漫谈会上发表了他们对国外的观感，下面便是他们发言的主要内容。
    在欧洲有这样的说法：德累斯顿是易北河上一颗晶莹的珍珠，美术工艺品闻名于欧洲；布达佩斯是多瑙河上的鲜花，地理人文都很美丽。但是德累斯顿在将解放时被美军狂炸数次，死伤达三十万人，美丽的城市被炸成一片废墟。而布达佩斯，当苏军解放它时，斯大林同志曾命令苏军不要打毁它，不要用重武器。在只能使用轻武器的情况下，苏军付出了重大的生命代价，使多瑙河上这朵鲜花得以保存。匈牙利完成了三年计划以后，又在进行五年计划的建设了，炼钢厂建立起来了，地下铁道正在建立着。德累斯顿也在废墟上重建着。民主德国的政府为了使那颗“珍珠”重新放光，拨了巨款来修建它，把一个有名的宫殿照原样重建，雕刻力求不走原样。有一个老教授也在孜孜不倦地工作着，他相信这次重建以后，就不会再毁了，因为他对保卫世界和平有了信心。在苏联的无私的帮助下，民主德国的工业建设与文化建设同时并进。对于德国法西斯加给苏联的惨重灾害，苏联一点也没有算在德国人民头上。
    中国青年文工团全体同志在德累斯顿参加了一天义务劳动，受到了很大的教育。团员们在废墟上找到不少生活工具和劳动工具，摇篮架子、锅子、杓子……他们深刻地体会到在瓦砾下面曾埋葬了多少幸福的家庭和人民对和平美好生活的要求是那样强烈，在德国那些饱经炮火的大厦里，窗口上找得到花盆的地方就说明里面住着人。戏院歌剧院兴起了，音乐也在人民之中复活了。劳动人民以超额完成生产计划欢迎国际朋友。
    波兰的华沙，这不屈的城市，又漂亮起来了；它还在有计划地建设着，要把自己建设成一个崭新的城市。爱好和平的人民向往着共产主义建设。在希特勒匪徒搞的集中营和杀人工厂里，陈列着由人的脂肪制成的肥皂、人的头发织成的布、成堆的打落下来的人的牙齿。在这里充分表现出法西斯的野兽本质。领导参观的人就是在集中营中的受难者，他不只一次地告诉参观人：请不要以看博物馆的心情来看这些地方，我们活着的人要完成死者未完成的志愿！德国法西斯还发明一种光线，对少女照射以后，她不久便变得衰老了。波兰经过了怎样的浩劫！可是今天，波兰在努力恢复一切美好文化传统，连萧邦的家也修好了。
    罗马尼亚在苏联的援助下，正在开运河，将使多少沙漠变成良田，使多瑙河与黑海相通。水上运输将使罗马尼亚人民的生活更幸福。苏联不只给以开河的机械，还帮助罗马尼亚培养干部。当青年文工团在罗京表演时，在一个山上遇到一位工人，他向中国朋友们献花，口里念着诗一样的句子，要他们把罗马尼亚工人对中国工人同志的敬意带回去。当他拿到毛主席的纪念章时，他对它吻了又吻。“王贵与李香香”这个剧本就要在罗马尼亚上演了。
    保加利亚的工人可以说得出每一个兄弟国家领袖的名字。他们把在苏联援助下完成的最近代化的工厂叫作“苏保友谊的结晶”。他们正在汇集几条河流建立发电站，在绿草地上建立他们粉红色的工厂大厦。保加利亚人民为朝鲜人民募寒衣时，许多人当场解衣。大家认识到这个真理：世界上爱好和平的人民的斗争是一致的。保加利亚人民说：我们虽然只有七百万人口，但还是强大的，因为中保人口的总和是五万万零七百万呀！
    捷克斯洛伐克人民也说：你们抗美援朝就是保卫我们的建设，所以文工团中来自志愿军的同志最受欢迎。捷克斯洛伐克演过“白毛女”，还要演“刘胡兰”，他们还要求继续介绍中国的好剧本。捷宣传与文化部部长柯别茨基从中国回去，大大赞扬中国，他说曾经横跨长江五次。
    在人民民主国家，毛主席的一些著作有了译本，威玛剧院把“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”当作必读课本。罗马尼亚和保加利亚的军事学校也学习中国的军事经验。在保加利亚的“军人之家”里，战士们学习“在地图前旅行”，按着国名说出每一国家的领袖名字和国家情况，墙上挂了毛主席和朱总司令的照片和“向中国的军事经验学习”的标语。
    东欧人民民主国家对我们的“三反”“五反”运动和文艺整风学习非常关心，他们知道这会使得中国的建设工作迅速进行。他们对中国人民在毛主席的英明领导下所进行的伟大的思想改造运动，非常钦佩。
    奥地利的情况就不同了。一般小市民在美军和反动政府统治下有着寒蝉一般的心情。那个和我们文工团接洽演出的剧场经理，起初用三个手指和我们的同志握手，而且一面看着手表说：他只有五分钟时间可以谈话。可是在我们的文工团多次演出之后，他改变了态度，称赞演出的节目是他们剧院二十年来最好的节目，最受欢迎的节目。许多观众在我们演出终场时到台前来送各种礼物，一位老太太要把她的金镯子送给演“白毛女”中的喜儿的王崑，抱了她亲吻，说她自己也有过类似喜儿的生活。一对工人母女陆续看了五次演出，也来送礼物，当她们得到毛主席纪念章时，感动得哭了起来。
    奥地利的人民是勇敢的。当中国青年文工团在那边的时候，他们曾在维也纳反动市政府的门前举行了一次两万人的集会，会上通过了向中国人民和毛泽东主席致敬的电文，群众高呼“美军滚出去”。中国的朋友真是遍于全世界。奥地利进步人民和我们的文工团团员们谈话时，用“他们”称呼他们的反动统治者，而用“我们”称呼中国人民和他们自己。
    奥地利是具有着音乐传统的国家，莫札尔和贝多芬在维也纳度过了他们长久的音乐创作生活，可是如今，维也纳一家歌剧院修建了七年还没有完成，建筑架都快腐朽了，反动市政府说没钱修。钱都修了美国军营和咖啡馆了。人民要想修莫札尔故乡的房屋，政府不修，如今房子被意大利商人买去盖保险公司了。反动统治者把音乐家的故居变成马房，毫不惋惜，这和民主德国修建歌德的故乡威玛，保护诗人的故居像保护眼珠子一样的情况比较起来，那是多么鲜明的对照！这里充分显示出走向社会主义与人民民主制度的优越性。
    今天，奥地利优秀的音乐传统正遭着厄运，没有气节的音乐家早被美国搞走了，留下的则过着艰苦的日子，乐队工作者每天得工作十二小时，音乐教授兼很多课还难生活，衣破鞋也破。许多音乐家变成流浪街头的“歌丐”。一个规模宏大的戏剧学校只有学生五十多人，还多是外国学生。奥地利商店的冷落情况是文工团旅行过的国家中绝无仅有的。
    东欧人民民主国家都认为他们和中国的友谊，是跟他们和苏联的友谊分不开的。苏联曾经以人的鲜血和生命援助他们，现在又竭力帮助他们建设。许多国家建立了斯大林城，当我们文工团演唱“斯大林颂”时，观众用掌声和欢呼表示他们的共鸣。日丹诺夫在文艺上的指导思想普及于各国。
    当文工团到了苏联的时候，很多同志都为所遇到的新鲜事物兴奋得睡不着觉：大家都认为莫斯科可以算得世界上最美丽的城市了，可是这个城市现在正在变得更美丽，一个庞大的城市改建计划正在付诸实施，除了莫斯科大学三十四层的高楼已告建成外，沿河正矗立起一座座新的巨厦。莫斯科的地下电车，原是任何资本主义国家所无法仿效的，可是今年又完成了第三层地下环形铁路，每个车站都是金碧辉煌，像宫殿一样的富丽。他们还曾亲眼看到了一些伟大共产主义建设的景象：拖拉机产量平均一刻钟一辆；在最严寒的日子，巨大的暖房里却盛开着鲜花。从基辅到伊尔库次克，从乌克兰到西伯利亚，到处都建立了最讲究的戏院和文化宫，而且到处都有为群众所热爱的人民演员和斯大林奖金获得者。苏联人民对各兄弟国家的建设关怀备至，文工团在参观某工厂时，看到有专为中国订货而生产的车间，真是感动极了。
    各国认为我们文工团的成功的节目是执行了毛泽东文艺路线的成果；认为我们继承了古代的优秀文化传统，对各国进步文化艺术的尊重也给各国人民深刻的印象。艺术形式丰富多样；很多节目反映了现实生活和斗争，充满了爱国主义和国际主义的热情及革命乐观主义的情绪。
    在联欢节大会上，我们的文工团除演出节目多次外并参加了文艺节目竞赛，“三岔口”、“红绸舞”等舞蹈节目获得了集体一等奖；瞿希贤作曲的“全世界人民心一条”，获得了作曲比赛的二等奖；独唱比赛有李志曙得二等奖，郑兴丽及刘燕平得优秀表演奖；韩中杰得长笛独奏三等奖，周广仁得钢琴独奏三等奖，杨秉荪的小提琴得优秀表演奖；文工团中的杂技队获得“在联欢节中最出色的表演者”奖。各兄弟国家的人民称我们的文工团为“和平的使节”、“五千年优秀文化的继承者”和“新中国文化的传播者”。
    中国青年文工团此次周游这些国家，向各国人民宣传和学习，尤其是对于保卫和平有了进一步的认识。和平是什么？用青年文工团团员们的话说，是：文化宫、托儿所、花园、学校、工厂、农庄、运河、甚至无痛分娩法。
    建设它们，保卫它们吧！
