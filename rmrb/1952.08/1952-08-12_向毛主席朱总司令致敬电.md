To our beloved Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

    We, filled with boundless joy, report to our beloved leaders that the 25th Anniversary All-Army Sports Meeting of the "August 1st" Army Day, under your care and guidance, has victoriously and successfully concluded.

    The various sports and arts competitions, performances, and cultural learning tests held at this meeting demonstrate the significant achievements our army has made in cultural learning and cultural and sports activities in recent years. Our army is not only an invincible army with powerful combat effectiveness but also possesses a high level of cultural literacy and a healthy physique, having already achieved brilliant results in regularization and modernization. This meeting, through mutual learning and exchange of experiences, will directly promote the development of cultural learning and cultural and sports activities throughout the army and the country in the future, and will have a far-reaching impact on production and national defense construction.

    This meeting was conducted throughout in a spirit of humble learning, unity and friendship, promoting collectivism and revolutionary heroism. All participants demonstrated a strong sense of organization and discipline, and good sportsmanship, achieving victory without arrogance, defeat without discouragement, active progress, and unity, fully demonstrating the inherent fine qualities of our People's Liberation Army. We guarantee that we will bring the spirit and fine style of the meeting back to our units, strengthen training, and improve our skills, so that the cultural and sports activities of the entire army can develop healthily along the correct path.

    Beloved Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu! We deeply know that American imperialism is still invading Korea and continuing to arm Japan and West Germany, attempting to expand its aggressive war. We will always remember Chairman Mao's teaching to us: "We are always a fighting force." We firmly remember the principle of developing cultural and sports activities to serve the construction of the army. We pledge: We will certainly follow the instructions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to "develop sports and improve the people's physique" and "train ourselves to have an iron physique to defend our most beloved country" and strengthen cultural learning. We will launch more in-depth combat-oriented and mass-based cultural and sports activities in the entire army, make concerted efforts to improve the cultural level of the troops, and strive to accelerate the construction of a regularized and modernized national defense force! We will fight against imperialist aggression, defend our motherland, and defend peace in the East and the world!

    The Sports Meeting of the 25th Anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
