Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 5th: A grand rally attended by 12,000 people was held in Alppila Park in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, on the 3rd, to celebrate the closing of the 15th International Olympic Games. The meeting was held by workers' organizations in Helsinki and athletes from many countries participating in the Games, with the aim of strengthening international peace and friendly relations. Athletes from Finland, the Soviet Union, China, the United States and other countries participating in this Games delivered speeches one after another, all of them emphasizing the significant role of the Olympic Games in strengthening peace and friendship among people all over the world.

    The famous Finnish female skier, Weideman, emphasized in her speech: Athletes from many countries not only participated in large-scale competitions in the honest competition of the International Olympic Games, but mainly deepened the connections between the people of many countries around the world through this Games. At the Olympic Games, athletes from various countries with different political beliefs met in a mutually friendly atmosphere and learned to respect each other. Let international relations also be filled with the spirit of peace like in the Olympic Games. Long live the friendship of people all over the world!

    The Soviet athlete Zhukalin, the all-around champion of gymnastics in this Games, delivered a speech amidst the warm welcome of the audience. On behalf of the Soviet athletes and all peace-loving Soviet people, he extended greetings to the audience and the Finnish people, and wished them new victories in the struggle for peace and international friendship. At the end of his speech, Zhukalin shouted long live international friendship, long live the friendship between the Finnish and Soviet people, and long live the victory of peace and truth in the world.

    The next speaker was Chen Wenbin, a member of the basketball team of the People's Republic of China participating in the Olympic Games. He extended sincere greetings to the Finnish people and Finnish athletes on behalf of the Chinese people. He said that Chinese athletes are willing to strengthen friendly ties with athletes from all countries, so as to help promote international friendship and build lasting peace.

    An athlete from Detroit, USA, representing the American youth, extended warm greetings to the audience. He said: The friendly gathering at the Olympic Games pointed out the way forward for the people of all countries—the road to peace. We believe that this spirit of friendship should also be applied to international relations. This will stop the slaughter and bloodshed in Korea and eliminate the threat of atomic war facing the world.

    The last speaker at the meeting was the Czechoslovakian athlete Zatopek, a world record holder who won three championships in this Games. In his speech, he pointed out the great significance of this Games in strengthening international peace and friendship. He emphasized that the participation of Soviet athletes in this Games was of decisive importance in this regard.

Finally, he shouted amidst thunderous applause from the audience, long live strengthening international peace and friendship.

    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：三日在芬兰首都赫尔辛基的阿尔皮拉公园举行了有一万二千人参加的盛大集会，庆祝第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会闭幕。这个会是赫尔辛基的工人组织和参加运动会的许多国家的运动家举行的，目的在于加强国际和平和友好关系。参加本届运动会的芬兰、苏联、中国、美国等国的运动员先后发表演说，他们都着重指出了奥林匹克运动会在加强全世界人民间的和平和友谊方面所起的重大作用。
    著名芬兰女滑雪家魏迪曼发言时着重指出：许多国家的运动员不仅是在国际奥林匹克运动会的诚实的竞争中进行大规模比赛，而主要是通过这届运动会加深了全世界许多国家人民的联系。在奥林匹克运动会上，来自各国的抱有不同政治信仰的运动员在相互友好的气氛中相会，学习互相尊重。让国际关系上也充满像在奥林匹克运动会上那样的和平精神吧。全世界各国人民友好万岁！
    本届运动会的机巧运动绝对冠军苏联选手朱卡林在听众的热烈欢迎中发表演说，他代表苏联运动员和爱好和平的全体苏联人民，向听众和芬兰人民致意，祝他们在争取和平和国际友好的斗争中赢得新的胜利。朱卡林在演说的末尾高呼国际友好万岁，芬兰人民和苏联人民的友谊万岁，和平与真理在世界上的胜利万岁。
    接着发言的是中华人民共和国参加奥林匹克运动会的篮球队队员陈文彬。他代表中国人民向芬兰人民和芬兰运动员致热诚的敬礼。他说，中国运动员愿意和所有国家的运动员加强友好的联系，从而帮助促进国际友谊和建立稳固的和平。
    一个来自美国底特律的运动员代表美国青年向听众致热烈的敬礼。他说：奥林匹克运动会上的友好聚会，向各国人民指出了前进的道路——通往和平的道路。我们相信这种友好精神也应当适用在国际关系上。这样就会使朝鲜的屠杀和流血停止，使世界所面临的原子战争的威胁消除。
    在会上最后发言的是在本届运动会中得三项冠军，世界纪录保持者捷克斯洛伐克运动健将萨托皮克。他在演说中指出本届运动会在加强国际和平和友谊方面的伟大意义。他强调说：苏联运动员的参加本届运动会在这方面有决定性的重要意义。萨托皮克极力谴责某些国家的某些集团阻止朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和德意志民主共和国运动员参加奥林匹克运动会的不合理的政策。他最后在全场雷动的掌声中高呼加强国际和平和友好万岁。
