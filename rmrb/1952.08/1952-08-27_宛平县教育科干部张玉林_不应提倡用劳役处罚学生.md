    Wanping County Education Section cadre Zhang Yulin
    Should Not Advocate Using Labor as Punishment for Students
    To the Editor: Zhang Yulin, a cadre of the Education Section of the Wanping County People's Government, violated the New Democratic education policy by treating elementary school students with disguised corporal punishment, creating a very negative impact. I am now telling you about this matter, hoping it will attract everyone's attention.
    Zhang Rushan, a fourth-grade boy at Qian Sangyu Village Elementary School in the Second District of Wanping County, is usually very naughty and often quarrels with his classmates. Once, he said that a male classmate and a female classmate were a couple, which made the female classmate very upset. At this time, Comrade Zhang Yulin of the County Education Section happened to come to the school and learned about this incident at a student union meeting. He advocated punishing Zhang Rushan with a month of labor, requiring him to dig and fill the toilet and clean the classroom every day. This erroneous guidance caused a very bad influence among the students. When Zhang Rushan was about to complete his labor punishment, the student union cadres used another small matter as an excuse to continue punishing him with another week of labor.
    Zhang Yulin is an educational administrative cadre of the People's Government, and it is completely wrong for him to violate policy and advocate disguised corporal punishment. I suggest that the Wanping County People's Government give him serious criticism and education, and seriously handle this matter. Chen Shimin

    宛平县教育科干部张玉林
    不应提倡用劳役处罚学生
    编辑同志：宛平县人民政府教育科干部张玉林违反新民主主义的教育政策，用变相体罚的方法来对待小学生，造成了很不好的影响。现在我把这件事情告诉你们，希望能引起大家的注意。
    宛平县二区前桑峪村小学校四年级男生张汝山，平日很顽皮，经常和同学吵闹。有一次，他说一个男同学和一个女同学是两口子，说得女同学很有意见。这时，县教育科张玉林同志刚好到学校里来，在学生会的会议上知道了这件事，就主张罚张汝山劳役一个月，每天要他挖、垫厕所和打扫教室。这种错误的指导，在学生中引起了很坏的影响。张汝山被罚劳役快满期时，学生会干部又拿一件小事情为理由，继续罚他劳役一个星期。
    张玉林是人民政府教育行政干部，竟违反政策提倡变相体罚，这是十分错误的。我建议宛平县人民政府对他进行严正的批评教育，并认真处理这件事。　陈世民
