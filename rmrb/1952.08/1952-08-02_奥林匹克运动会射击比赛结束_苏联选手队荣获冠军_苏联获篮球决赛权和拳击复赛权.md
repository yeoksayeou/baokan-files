Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 31st - According to TASS, the shooting competition of the 15th International Olympic Games has concluded, with the Soviet Union winning the championship.

In the four-day shooting competition, Soviet athletes achieved the best results, scoring a total of 27 points, winning one gold medal, one silver medal, and four bronze medals. Norway and Switzerland ranked second and third respectively, each with 17 points. Hungary was fourth with 16 points. Finland was fifth with 15 points. Romania was sixth with 13 points. Sweden and the United States ranked seventh and eighth respectively, each with 12 points.

They won first and second place respectively in shooting at half-face silhouette targets with pistols; out of a maximum of 600 points, Kodák scored 579 points and Geng-Szirard scored 578 points.

Boxing competitions continued on the 30th. In the flyweight boxing competition, Soviet champion Bulakov defeated European champion Bosani of Italy. The Soviet boxer took the upper hand in the first round, landing a heavy blow on his opponent. In the second round, Bosani began to become active, but Bulakov immediately counterattacked, forcing his opponent to take a defensive position again. Bulakov dominated the third round. The referees unanimously decided that Bulakov won.

In the featherweight competition, the Soviet's Garbuzov fought fiercely against the Mexican boxer Matias, and Garbuzov eventually won.

The result of a lightweight match between Soviet athlete Chasuhin and British athlete Reardon caused widespread surprise and indignation among the audience. In the first round, Chasuhin continuously attacked, driving his opponent into the corner of the ring, and Chasuhin's advantage was obvious. In the second round, Chasuhin continued to attack but accidentally slipped. The referee in the ring immediately judged him as being knocked down. In the last round, Chasuhin struck quickly again. A fierce blow knocked his opponent down. The British athlete only got up from the ground after counting to eight, but was clearly exhausted. Chasuhin had a complete advantage throughout the entire match. After the bell rang, the referees deliberated for a long time and unexpectedly ruled that Reardon scored, which caused dissatisfaction among the audience. The Soviet sports delegation has lodged a firm protest against this unfair decision by the referees.

Finnish newspapers have mentioned that in some matches of Soviet weightlifters, the referees acted unfairly. "Labor People's Daily" specifically mentioned a match between Soviet athlete Sokolov and French athlete Fantaja. Although Sokolov was more active throughout the match, the referees ruled that Fantaja won. The newspaper said: "In this match and in some other matches, the referees were clearly biased."

On the 30th, the referee's decision in a featherweight match between Romanian athlete Ilia and American athlete Brown was also unexpected. Romanian athlete Ilia won two rounds. However, the referees ruled that the American athlete won. The audience immediately protested, expressing their dissatisfaction.

The results of several other boxing matches on the 30th were: Italian athlete Bronesi defeated American athlete Bickel, Soviet athlete Shcherbakov defeated South African athlete Van der Linde, and Soviet athlete Mednov defeated Romanian athlete Ambrus. The boxing athletes of the people's democratic countries also achieved good results. Romanian flyweight athlete Dobrescu defeated Swedish boxer Jansen, Czechoslovak athlete Medlaus defeated Puerto Rican Figueroa on points, Polish Drogos defeated Brazilian athlete Carazo, Hungarian athlete Erdei defeated Saar athlete Hille, and Czechoslovak athlete Zahara defeated South Korean athlete.

Basketball and water polo competitions continued on the 30th. In the basketball competition, the Soviet team defeated the Chilean team. In the first half of the match, the Soviet team took the lead with 41 points to 29 points. In the second half, the Soviet team's advantage became even more obvious, and they finally won the match with 78 points to 60 points. Therefore, the Soviet basketball team has qualified to participate in the finals; the United States, Argentina, and Uruguay will also participate in the finals.
