The organization of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Court in Shanxi Province is seriously impure. Revolutionary traitors and bad elements from the old judicial personnel have seized leadership and judicial power. In the past three years, many serious incidents of lawlessness, discipline violation, and corruption have occurred. The court has basically deteriorated and should be thoroughly reformed and rectified during this judicial reform movement.

The former president of the court, Du Qianqiu, was a revolutionary traitor who joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1932. He defected in 1936 and successively served as the secretary of Yan Xishan's bandit gang office, the director of affairs, supervisor, and chief of the investigation section of the Japanese puppet Shanxi Provincial Anti-Communist Committee, and also worked in the "Zhouzhinei Mansion," a Japanese intelligence agency. In 1947, he sneaked into the liberated area, arrived at the Taiyuan Administrative Office, falsely claiming to have "lived in seclusion at home and only now escaped from the tiger's mouth," and entered Northern University and Shanxi University as a teacher. In 1950, he was appointed president of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Court and was elected as a city representative, a member of the Municipal Consultative Committee, and a member of the Municipal Government until he was dismissed during the "Three-Anti" movement.

The court was established on the basis of the Yan bandit puppet court and retained a large number of old judicial personnel. Currently, of the 47 cadres in the court, 23 are old personnel. Among the 27 people engaged in judicial work, 17 are old personnel. Among the 23 old personnel, 13 were old judicial personnel who had served in the puppet judicial organs for a long time, and 19 had participated in reactionary parties and groups, some of whom were counter-revolutionaries who were still active after liberation. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, two counter-revolutionaries committed suicide out of fear of punishment. Zhao Ding, a clerk of the court, served as the secretary of the Japanese and Yan puppet municipal government, the cadre of the county political guard, and the recorder of the puppet High Court before liberation. He participated in organizations such as Yan bandit's "Comrades Association" and "Special Agent," was retained after liberation to work in judicial work, and still had contact with counter-revolutionary organizations. Another clerk, Wang Fengxiang, was a landlord and a member of the Kuomintang. He served as the acting chief of the construction section of Ren County, Hebei Province, during the Japanese puppet regime, loyally serving the enemy, beating the masses, demolishing houses, cutting down trees, and forcing civilians to build blockhouses. He committed numerous crimes and was hated by the local people. After the liberation of Ren County, the masses carried out anti-traitor liquidation struggles. He fled to Taiyuan out of fear of punishment and served as a recorder in the Yan bandit Taiyuan District Court. He was retained after liberation and served as a clerk.

This group of reactionary elements, who have committed numerous evils, occupied important positions in the People's Court, used their power to engage in corruption, acted recklessly, and harmed the people. The masses reflected: "The court led by the Communist Party is controlled by the Kuomintang." This fully illustrates the seriousness of the problem.

During the "Three-Anti" movement, the court found that 15 old personnel had problems with corruption, accounting for more than half of the old personnel. Thirteen of these 15 people were engaged in judicial work. All acts of corruption were extremely egregious, such as giving light sentences for serious crimes, secretly releasing prisoners, secretly changing verdicts, acting as black lawyers to write pleadings for parties, tipping off prisoners, arbitrarily using prohibited items, embezzling赃物, extorting, etc. Du Qianqiu, the former president of the court, used his power to engage in corruption and bribery to exonerate criminals and reduce their sentences. The criminal Yan Ziqing bribed him with two million yuan to extend the bail period, and he agreed without authorization. The criminal Zhang Shichun should have been sentenced to three years, but Du Qianqiu changed the sentence to two years after receiving a bribe. Once, he accepted a bribe from the criminal Dong Yugang and promised to release Dong. Because the release was delayed, Dong's mother shouted and made a scene in front of the court: "I spent money, but the person is not released!" Passers-by heard this and commented: "Now the court still wants money!" Zhao Ding, a clerk of the court, notified the counter-revolutionary leader to attend the court to listen to the trial of counter-revolutionary cases, inquired about the trial situation, privately changed the verdict, and arbitrarily changed the detention date. Yan Daoqi (old personnel), a clerk of the court, even bargained with the parties in the solemn courtroom and accepted a two million yuan guarantee note. When dealing with a criminal case involving Liu Hongbin, the manager of the Central Pharmacy, he used detention and sealing the door as a threat to extort one million yuan. Wang Fengxiang (old personnel), a clerk, tipped off the criminal Yang Qinying, allowing Yang to escape. When handling the case of Wu Songmei, who was accused of destroying finance, Wu did not accept the verdict and asked Yan Daoqi to find Wang Fengxiang, who wrote the appeal for Wu. Old judicial personnel Dang Zhongbin colluded with judge Tian Fu and others to arbitrarily use inventory gold, silver, and drugs for black market transactions; and deliberately let prisoners run away during the escort, embezzling赃物. Assistant judge Liu Qijie and judge Wang Tongxian both had despicable acts of insulting women by abusing their power.

These old personnel colluded with profiteers such as Du Xingcan to systematically win over and corrupt veteran cadres. Eleven veteran cadres in the court were dragged into the water. Zhang Shouchu alone dragged Yan Jiqian (chief judge), Tian Fu, Wang Tongxian, Du Chunfang (judge) and other four party member veteran cadres into the water. Zhang Shouchu also rented a room in the Xinsheng Hotel across the street from the court as a place for bribery and illegal transactions, forming a "black court" outside the court. Many cases were first negotiated with court cadres there, discussing how to sentence them, and then going to court to go through the motions. Therefore, some people called Zhang Shouchu the "president."

Not only cadres, but also some bailiffs extorted and oppressed the people. When ordinary people went to court, they were stopped by the gate guard (old personnel) if they did not have a complaint, taking the opportunity to extort.

The reason why the court is so chaotic, in addition to the serious impurity of the organization, another important reason is that some leading cadres of the court are deeply influenced by the old legal concepts and have long been making independence, believing that the court should not be led by the municipal people's government, and even believe that the word Taiyuan Municipal People's Government should not be prefixed above the People's Court on the badges. They neglected politics, were ideologically paralyzed, had purely technical views, blindly believed in the old judicial personnel, and believed that they had culture, technology, and could write judgments (old judicial jargon), and used them as backbone elements, allowing them to handle affairs independently. A deputy director of the court believed that Yan Daoqi and Wang Fengxiang were the strongest cadres in the court, and signed and issued their judgments without even looking at them, and promoted Yan Daoqi three times and sent him to study twice. During the "Three-Anti" movement, when the masses presented conclusive evidence of Yan Daoqi and Wang Fengxiang's corruption, the deputy director still did not believe it. Veteran cadre Du Chunfang also believed that the president could not change the judgment he wrote (the old legal concept of judicial independence), and directly handed his seal to the clerk to stamp and close the case by himself. In addition, the assignment of cases was arbitrarily selected by the contractors, and there were no fixed procedures for the execution of confiscation and handover of贓物. The case handlers could directly handle it. This gave bad elements a good opportunity to engage in corruption, extortion, and blackmail.

### 太原市人民法院组织严重不纯应彻底改造

    太原市人民法院组织严重不纯应彻底改造
    山西省太原市人民法院的组织严重不纯，革命叛徒和旧司法人员中的坏分子掌握了领导权和审判权，三年来发生了许多违法乱纪和贪赃枉法的严重事件。该法院已基本上变了质，应在这次司法改革运动中彻底改造和整顿。
    该法院前院长杜千秋是一个革命叛徒，曾在一九三二年加入中国共产党。一九三六年脱党，先后任阎锡山匪帮办公室秘书、日伪山西省剿共委员会事务主任、督导员、调查科科长，并曾在日寇的特务机关“洲之内公馆”任职；一九四七年潜入解放区，到达太原行署，伪称“隐居家园，现始逃出虎口”，混进我北方大学和山西大学任教；一九五○年任太原市人民法院院长，并当选为市代表，市协商委员和市府委员，直到“三反”运动中才被撤职。
    该法院是在接收阎匪伪法院的摊子上建立起来的，留用了大批旧司法人员。目前该院四十七个干部中，有旧人员二十三人。作审判工作的二十七人中有旧人员十七人。在二十三个旧人员中，曾经长期在伪司法机关供职的旧司法人员有十三人，参加过反动党团的有十九人，其中有的是解放以后仍有活动的反革命分子。在镇压反革命运动中，有两个反革命分子畏罪自杀。该院书记员赵鼎，解放前曾充当日、阎伪市政府书记、县政卫团干事，伪高等法院录事，参加过阎匪“同志会”、“特工”等组织，解放后留用，作审判工作，仍与反革命组织有联系。另一书记员王凤祥是地主成份、国民党员，曾充当日伪河北省任县建设科代理科长，忠实为敌人服务，殴打群众，拆毁民房，砍伐树木，强迫民工修筑炮台，罪恶多端，为当地群众所痛恨。任县解放后，群众进行反奸清算斗争，他畏罪潜逃到太原，任阎匪太原地方法院录事，解放后被留用，任书记员。
    这批作恶多端的反动分子占据了人民法院的重要位置，利用职权贪赃枉法，胡作非为，危害人民。群众的反映是：“共产党领导的法院，被国民党掌握了。”这充分说明了问题的严重性。
    在“三反”运动中该院查出旧人员有贪污问题的共十五人，占旧人员半数以上。这十五个人中有十三个是作审判工作的。所有贪污行为，情节都极端恶劣，如重罪轻判，偷放犯人，偷改判决，作黑律师代当事人写诉状，给犯人通风报信，擅自动用违禁物品，侵吞赃物，敲诈勒索等等。该院前院长杜千秋就曾利用职权贪污受贿，为犯人开脱罪责，减轻处刑。罪犯阎子清向他行贿二百万元，要求延长保释期限，他便擅自答应了。罪犯张时春本应处刑三年，杜千秋受贿后把判决改为二年。有一次，他接受犯人董玉岗的贿赂，答应将董释放，释放得迟了一些，董犯的母亲便到法院门口大叫大闹：“花了钱，人还不放出来！”过路群众听见，纷纷议论说：“现在法院还是要钱！”该院书记员赵鼎在审判反革命案件时，通知反革命头子到庭旁听，刺探审判情况并私改判决，擅改拘押日期。该院书记员阎道契（旧人员），甚至在庄严的法庭上与当事人讲价钱，收受贿赂二百万元的保票。处理某一案犯时，因牵涉到中央药房经理刘鸿斌，他即用扣押、封门相威胁，敲诈了一百万元。书记员王凤祥（旧人员），曾给罪犯杨勤英通风报信，使杨犯潜逃。在承办破坏金融犯吴松梅一案时，吴犯不服判决，托阎道契找王凤祥，王便代吴犯写上诉书。旧司法人员党仲宾勾结审判员田夫等，擅自动用库存金、银、毒品，进行黑市买卖；并在押解犯人途中故意将犯人放跑，侵吞了赃物。助审员刘启杰、审判员王桐仙都有利用职权侮辱妇女的卑鄙行为。
    这些旧人员曾与奸商杜星灿等勾结，有计划地拉拢和腐蚀老干部。该院有十一个老干部被拖下水。仅张守中一人就拉了阎纪前（审判长）、田夫、王桐仙、杜春芳（审判员）等四个党员老干部下水。张守中并在法院的对门新盛酒店专租了一间房子，作为行贿卖法的交易场所，形成了法院门外的“黑法院”。许多案件都是先在那里和法院干部讲好价钱，商量好如何判决，然后才到法院去走过场。因此有的群众称张守中为“院长”。
    不仅干部如此，有的法警亦敲诈勒索，欺压人民。老百姓去法院，如无诉状，即被门警（旧人员）拦阻，借机敲诈。
    该法院所以搞得这样乌烟瘴气，除组织严重不纯外，另一重要原因是该院部分领导干部受旧法观点影响很深，曾长期闹独立性，认为法院不应受市人民政府领导，连证章也认为不应在人民法院以上冠以太原市人民政府的字样。他们忽视政治，思想麻痹，单纯技术观点，盲目相信旧司法人员，认为他们有文化，有技术，会写判决书（旧司法八股），即当作骨干分子使用，任其独立办事。该院某副院长就认为阎道契、王凤祥是法院中最强的干部，对他们所写的判决书，连看也不看就予签发，并三次提拔阎道契，两次送他去学习。“三反”运动时，群众把阎道契、王凤祥二人贪赃枉法的确凿证据都摆出来了，这位副院长还不相信。老干部杜春芳也认为院长不能改他写的判决（司法独立的旧法观点），迳将自己的图章交给书记员，由他自行盖章结案。此外，在分配案件上由承办人任意挑选，执行没收、交赃等也无一定手续，办案人可以直接处理。这都给了坏分子以贪赃枉法、敲诈勒索的好机会。
