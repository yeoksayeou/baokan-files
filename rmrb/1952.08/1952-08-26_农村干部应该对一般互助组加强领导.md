    Rural Cadres Should Strengthen Leadership of General Mutual Aid Teams
    Editor: Last year, our mutual aid team had only three households, each with one laborer. We worked together to haul manure and plant the land, but we hoed separately. During the autumn harvest, we harvested together, and we also worked on sideline occupations separately. Even so, each laborer averaged thirteen piculs and three pecks of grain, which was much more than the local individual farmers. This proves that the power of mutual aid is indeed great. We accepted the people's government's education on "organizing," and decided to strengthen our mutual aid team. This spring, our mutual aid team expanded to seven households, and the labor force, cultivated land, livestock, and farm tools all increased. We lacked the methods for running a large-scale mutual aid team, so we learned from the examples of good mutual aid teams, strengthened production planning, established a method of work point calculation, and used work tickets. Our team is indeed more solid than last year. These practices were all explored by ourselves, and we don't know if they are correct. County and district cadres did not come to our team at all from the beginning of spring to the end of hoeing, they often helped those teams that were doing well. The members of our team felt uncomfortable, and everyone said, "If the cadres don't come to help, let's just do whatever we can!" After the end of hoeing, the weather was still very hot, and the team members wanted to rest for a few days and engage in some sideline production. The mutual aid team began to fall apart. Just then, the secretary of the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in our district and a comrade from the county came to our team. They helped us summarize our experiences and encouraged us to work hard to accumulate fertilizer during the fallow season (we didn't have the habit of accumulating fertilizer in the past) to prepare for increased production next year; they advised us not to only see the immediate benefits of engaging in sideline occupations, but to have long-term plans and strengthen the team's planning. These words were exactly what we were thinking, and everyone said "Yes!" With the help of the cadres, we formulated a year-round fertilizer accumulation plan, came up with methods for accumulating fertilizer at present, and also launched a challenge competition with other teams. This time the cadres helped us a lot, which increased our confidence and methods. It is hoped that cadres in various counties and districts will not only help the good teams, but also frequently go to the general teams to understand the situation and provide assistance.

### 农村干部应该对一般互助组加强领导

    农村干部应该对一般互助组加强领导
    编辑同志：去年我们互助组只有三户，每户有一个劳动力。拉粪种地，我们都在一起干活，锄地各干各的；秋收割地又在一起干活，搞副业又各干各的。就这样，每个劳力平均还打了十三石三斗粮食，比当地单干户打的粮食多得多。这证明互助起来的力量确是很大的。我们接受了人民政府“组织起来”的教育，决定加强互助组。今春我们互助组发展到七户，劳力、耕地、牲口、农具都增加了。我们缺少搞大型互助组的办法，就学着好的互助组的榜样干，加强生产计划性，定出评工计分办法，并且使用了工票。我们组确比去年巩固了。这些作法都是我们自己摸索出来的，不知道到底对不对。县区干部从开春到挂锄，根本没有到我们组来过，他们经常帮助那些办得好的组。我们组的组员感觉不得劲，大家说：“干部不来帮助，咱干到哪算哪吧！”挂锄以后，天气还很热，组员们都想歇几天，搞些副业生产。互助组涣散起来了。正在这时候，我区中共区委员会书记和县里一位同志来到我们组。他俩帮助我们总结了经验，鼓励我们在挂锄的时候，努力搞好积肥工作（过去我们没有积肥习惯），为来年增产作准备；他俩劝我们不要只看到搞副业的眼前利益，要有长远打算，要加强组的计划。这些话正说到我们心里，大家齐说“对呀！”在干部的帮助下，我们制订了常年的积肥计划，想出目前积肥的办法，还和别的组展开了挑战竞赛。这次干部对我们帮助很大，使我们增加了信心和办法。希望各地县区干部不要只帮那好的组，也要经常到一般组去了解情况进行帮助。
