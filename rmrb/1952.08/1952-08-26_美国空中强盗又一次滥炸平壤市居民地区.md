Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 25th: American air bandits once again carried out a wild bombing raid on residential areas of Pyongyang in the early morning of the 24th. This marks the fourth bloody atrocity committed by the American invading air force against the peaceful residents of Pyongyang in August. On the morning of the 24th, while people were sound asleep, more than ten American invading air force B-29 bombers dropped over 250 heavy bombs and incendiary bombs on areas such as Longxing-ri in the western district of Pyongyang, which had already been riddled with bomb craters, for more than an hour from 2:15 AM to 3:20 AM. Fifty-five elderly people, women, and children who could not escape in time were killed and wounded. Ninety-five remaining civilian houses and dugouts were destroyed, and more than 10,580 *pyeong* of farmland were devastated. Due to the effective air defense measures taken by the Pyongyang city authorities, the number of casualties has decreased with each successive attack. Sources here point out that the continuous creation of such extremely brutal bloody atrocities by American invading bandits to destroy peaceful cities and towns and massacre peaceful residents, besides further exposing to the world that the so-called concentrated bombing of "military targets" in northern Korea, vociferously touted by the war-mongers in Washington, is a complete and utter shameless lie, and further arousing the boundless hatred of the heroic Korean military and civilians against the American invading bandits, can achieve absolutely no other result.

    美国空中强盗又一次滥炸平壤市居民地区
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】美国空中强盗在二十四日清晨，又一次向平壤市居民地区肆行狂轰滥炸，这是在八月份内，美国侵略空军对平壤市和平居民的第四次血腥暴行。二十四日清晨，当人们正在酣睡的时候，美国侵略空军B二十九型轰炸机十多架在从上午二时十五分到三时二十分的一个多小时内，向业已被炸得弹坑累累的平壤市西区龙兴里等地，投掷了二百五十多颗重磅炸弹和烧夷弹。躲避不及的老弱妇孺被炸死、炸伤五十五人，残存的民房土窟被炸毁九十五所，田地被炸毁一万零五百八十多坪。由于平壤市当局采取了有效的防空措施，死伤的人数是一次比一次减少了。此间人士指出：美国侵略强盗连续制造这种残暴已极的毁灭和平城乡，屠杀和平居民的血腥暴行，除了向全世界进一步暴露出华盛顿的战争贩子们叫嚣的所谓集中轰炸朝鲜北部“军事目标”是彻头彻尾的无耻谎言，和更加激起英勇抗战的朝鲜军民对美国侵略强盗的无比憎恨之外，绝不能得到任何其他结果。
