    How Should We Accomplish the Task of Party Building?
    Fan Ruisheng, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    The Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and staff members of Beijing have undergone a most rigorous mass test and assessment in the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. The original non-Party activists in various factories, mines, enterprises, schools, private factories, and shops have also been tempered and tested in the movement, and a large number of activists have emerged from practical struggles. Their class consciousness has greatly improved, they have drawn a clear line between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and they have moved closer to our Party, actively requesting to join the Party. Some units' activists have already spontaneously organized "Party Application Groups" and "Eight Conditions for Party Membership Standards Study Groups." They demand themselves in terms of the eight conditions of Communist Party member standards in their thinking, work, and study. Our Party has also gained a deeper understanding of the thoughts and historical background of these activists. Under these circumstances, we should appropriately admit a group of active members of the masses into the Party, especially admitting outstanding industrial workers from factories and mines, to better strengthen the Party's leadership in all aspects and to meet the upcoming task of large-scale construction. That is to say, actively carrying out the work of developing new Party members has become an extremely important political task for us at present.

    To ensure the completion of the important task of developing the Party, we must strengthen ideological leadership over Party building work, strictly implement the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies on Party building, and overcome some incorrect views and incorrect practices in Party building work.

    We must make every Party member clearly recognize that developing the Party is a duty they should fulfill and strictly criticize the erroneous views of not caring about or even underestimating the Party's work. Many comrades, especially a few responsible Party cadres, believe that developing the Party is a matter for a few people, a matter for lower-level comrades, a matter for the Party's organization departments, which is wrong. This erroneous view is extremely serious among Party cadres in the organs, thus making it impossible for some mass activists who already meet the conditions for Party membership to join the Party for a long time. This actually hinders the development of the Party. The main reasons for these erroneous views are the unsound and lax branch life and insufficient political and ideological leadership. Therefore, we must first further rectify and re-elect branches on the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement and Party consolidation, strengthen branch life, establish and improve systems, clarify the tasks of the branches, make every Party member unconditionally accept the work tasks given to them by the branches, strengthen political study, deeply implement the guidelines for Party building, continue to promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, implement self-bottom-up mass supervision, strengthen top-down leadership inspection, and strictly adhere to Party life. Only in this way can we overcome those erroneous views.

    Educating Party cadres to correctly grasp the eight conditions of Party membership standards and opposing inappropriately raising Party member standards and adopting a bureaucratic attitude towards Party building work is another important link in grasping ideological leadership in Party building. Some responsible cadres in grassroots organizations, due to insufficient work and failure to pay attention to the education, assistance, and investigation of activists in peacetime, do not care about the political life of the masses, and therefore cannot put forward any specific opinions on those who apply to join the Party, only saying abstractly: "You still need to improve your consciousness," "Go create conditions yourself," "Test you further," and so on. Some Communist Youth League members submit their Party application letters to Party cadres, but the Party cadres say to them: "Read it yourself first!" Some people's Party application letters have no news after being submitted for half a year. This makes many non-Party activists feel that the Party is "out of reach" and do not know how to meet the conditions for joining the Party. Some believe that only going to the Korean front to be tested can they join the Party, some believe that only reading twelve "Cadre Must-Reads" can they join the Party, and some believe that only creating "miracles" can they join the Party. This confusion in thinking is greatly related to the irresponsible bureaucratic attitude of some of our comrades. This must be strictly corrected. There are also some Party cadres who are afraid of taking responsibility, afraid of trouble, and unwilling or dare not be introducers for new Party members. Many comrades inappropriately raise the standards for Party members, requiring activists who apply to join the Party to be proficient in communism and to have a clean history. In particular, some comrades emphasize ideological criticism in a way that is detached from reality. For example, someone's father is a retained personnel and was transferred to work in Xinjiang, but our comrades insist that he criticize whether this is a progressive or speculative behavior. Some student comrades pay attention to other people's life details and hold on to one point and refuse to let go. For example, a female student in a school was considered individualistic for going back to the dormitory to wash clothes and wipe shoes. Some comrades only pay attention to those who are prominent and make a big splash, but they cannot see the people who have been working hard all along, and they think that his political influence is small. Although these are only individual phenomena, this exposes that some Party cadres have a biased understanding of the eight conditions of Party membership standards, and they have not correctly grasped the standards for Party members in their actual work. The political level of these Party cadres is still very low, detached from reality, looking at problems in an isolated and one-sided way, and the tendency of dogmatism is still quite serious. Therefore, further in-depth study of the eight conditions of Party membership standards and educating Party cadres through the actual work of developing the Party so that they correctly grasp the eight conditions as the standards for Party members is still a very important task at present.

    In order to develop new Party members in large numbers, we must regularly educate the mass activists and systematically investigate them. The selection of mass activists must be nominated by the Party小组 (xiaozu) [Party Group], reviewed and approved by the branch, reported to the higher-level Party committee for record, and then organized to conduct planned education on communism, the Communist Party, and the eight conditions of Party membership standards. Through study groups, we can understand their ideological situation, level of consciousness, work performance, and investigate their history. Each branch must designate a special person to be responsible for leading this work and establish a system of inspection, reporting, and summarization at each level. The past method of individual contact is no longer suitable for the current situation. At the same time, the Communist Youth League and trade unions, in addition to strengthening education on communism and the Communist Party for Communist Youth League members and trade union members, should also plan to recommend outstanding members of the Communist Youth League and trade union members as candidates for developing Party members to cooperate with the Party's development work.

    We must improve our working methods in Party building work. The most important thing is to strengthen the education and investigation of development targets in peacetime and not rely solely on interviews with organizers to solve all problems. Before the interview, we must study the overall situation and key issues of the applicant and find the main issues that need to be investigated. In the past, because the work was not done enough in peacetime, the situation of the development targets lacked analysis and research, and the key points could not be grasped, so the interview time was as long as one hundred hours, which was time-consuming and repetitive, and even after doing so, the problem was not clarified. To avoid this phenomenon, we can adopt the method of joint interviews by branch committee members and higher-level organizers in the future. Before the branch general meeting discusses and approves the admission of new Party members, it is also necessary to make full preparations. The branch committee should make a preliminary conclusion on the applicant and submit it to the branch general meeting for discussion. It should also focus on explaining the conditions and key issues of the applicant in terms of Party membership standards to avoid prolonging the discussion time indefinitely.

    In the future Party building work, we must neither lower the standards nor keep those who meet the conditions for joining the Party out of the door of the Party organization. Therefore, there is a great need to solve the above-mentioned main problems from ideological and organizational perspectives.

    我们应该怎样去完成建党的任务
    中共北京市委员会组织部副部长  范儒生
    北京市的共产党员、青年团员和机关工作人员，在伟大的“三反”“五反”运动中受了一次最严格的群众性的考验和鉴定；各工矿、企业、学校、私营工厂及商店原有的非党积极分子在运动中同样受到了锻炼和考验，并且有大批的积极分子从实际斗争中涌现出来。他们的阶级觉悟大为提高，划清了无产阶级和资产阶级的界限，更进一步靠拢了我们的党，积极要求入党。有些单位的积极分子已经自动组织起“入党小组”“党员标准八项条件学习会”。他们在思想、工作和学习中都以共产党员标准的八项条件要求自己。我们的党对于这些积极分子的思想和历史情况，也有了进一步的了解。在这种情况下，我们完全应该适当地接收一批群众的积极分子入党，特别是接收工矿企业中优秀的产业工人入党，以便更好地加强党在各方面的领导作用，迎接即将到来的大规模建设的任务。这就是说，积极进行发展新党员的工作，已经成为我们当前极其重要的政治任务了。
    为了保证完成发展党的重大的任务，我们必须加强对建党工作的思想领导，严格地执行党中央关于建党的方针和政策，克服在建党工作中的一些不正确的观点和不正确的做法。
    我们必须使每一个党员明确认识发展党是自己应尽的义务，严格批判不关心甚至轻视党的工作的错误观点。有很多同志，尤其是少数负责的党员干部，认为发展党是少数人的事，是下级同志的事，是党的组织部门的事，这是错误的。这种错误观点在机关党员干部中表现得极为严重，因而使一些已经具备了党员条件的群众积极分子长期不能入党。这实际上是阻碍了党的发展。这些错误观点产生的主要原因是支部生活不健全和松懈，政治和思想领导不够。因此，我们首先要在“三反”运动和整党的基础上进一步整理和改选支部，加强支部生活，建立和健全制度，明确支部的任务，使每一个党员无条件地接受支部所给予自己的工作任务，加强政治学习，深入贯彻建党的方针，继续发扬民主，展开批评和自我批评，实行自下而上的群众监督，加强自上而下的领导检查，严格党的生活。只有这样才能克服那些错误的观点。
    教育党员干部正确地掌握党员标准的八项条件，反对不适当地提高党员标准和对于建党工作采取官僚主义态度，这是在建党中掌握思想领导的又一重要环节。有些基层组织的负责干部，由于工作不深入，平时不注意对积极分子的教育帮助和考察，不关心群众的政治生活，因而对申请入党者提不出什么具体意见，只抽象地说：“你还需要提高觉悟”、“你自己去创造条件吧”、“再考验考验”等等。有的青年团员把入党申请书送交党员干部，那位党员干部却对他说：“你自己先看吧！”有的人把入党申请书送上去半年没有下落。这样就使许多非党积极分子觉得党是“高不可攀”的，不知道应该怎样才够得上入党的条件。有的认为只有到朝鲜前线去考验才能入党，有的认为只有读了十二本“干部必读”才能入党，有的认为只有创造“奇迹”才能入党。这些思想上的混乱，和我们的某些同志不负责任的官僚主义态度有很大关系。这是必须严格地加以纠正的。还有一些党员干部怕负责任，怕麻烦，不愿或不敢做新党员入党的介绍人。有很多同志不适当地提高党员的标准，对申请入党的积极分子要求精通共产主义，要求历史清白。特别是有一些同志不着边际地强调进行思想批判。例如某人的父亲是留用人员，被调到新疆去工作，我们的同志却一定要他批判这是进步的还是投机的行为。有的学生同志专注意别人的生活细节，抓住一点死不肯放。例如某校一个女学生回宿舍洗洗衣服，擦擦鞋，被认为是个人主义。有的同志只注意那些出头露面的轰轰烈烈的人物，对于一贯埋头苦干的人却看不到眼里，认为他的政治影响小。这些虽然只是个别现象，但这暴露了有的党员干部对于党员标准的八项条件的了解是有偏差的，他们在实际工作中还没有正确掌握党员的标准。这些党员干部的政治水平还很低，脱离实际，孤立片面地看问题，教条主义倾向还相当严重。因此，进一步深入学习党员标准的八项条件，并通过发展党的实际工作来教育党员干部，使他们正确地掌握作为党员标准的八项条件，这在目前仍然是非常重要的工作。
    为了大量地发展新党员，我们必须对群众积极分子经常地进行教育，系统地加以考察。对于群众积极分子的选拔，必须由党的小组提名，支部审查批准，报上级党委备案，然后把他们组织起来，有计划地进行关于共产主义和共产党及党员标准的八项条件的教育，通过学习小组，了解他们的思想情况、觉悟程度、工作表现，考察他们的历史。各个支部都必须指定专人负责领导这个工作，并逐级建立检查、汇报和总结的制度。过去个别联系的办法，已经不适合于目前的情况了。同时青年团和工会，除对青年团员和工会会员应加强关于共产主义和共产党的教育之外，并应有计划地推荐青年团员和工会会员中的优秀分子作为发展党员的对象，以配合党的发展工作。
    我们在建党工作中必须改善工作方法。最主要的是加强平时对发展对象的教育和考察工作，不应单纯依靠组织员谈话去解决一切问题。在谈话前，要研究申请入党者的全面情况和关键问题，找出需要考察的主要问题。过去有的因为平时工作做得不够，对发展对象的情况缺乏分析研究，抓不住要害，因而谈话时间有长达一百多个小时的，既费时又重复，甚至有的在这样做了之后还没有把问题弄清楚。为了避免这种现象，今后可以采取支部委员和上级组织员联合谈话的方式。支部大会讨论通过新党员入党以前，也要有充分准备，支委会对申请入党者应做出初步结论，提交支部大会讨论时，并应着重说明以党员标准衡量申请入党者的条件和关节问题，以免不着边际地拖长讨论的时间。
    在今后建党工作中，我们既不能降低标准，又要使有条件入党者不至于被关在党组织的门外。因此，从思想上、组织上来解决以上的几个主要问题，就有很大的需要了。
