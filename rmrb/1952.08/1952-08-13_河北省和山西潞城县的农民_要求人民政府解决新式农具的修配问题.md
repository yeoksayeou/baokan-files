Farmers in Hebei Province and Lucheng County, Shanxi Province
Request the People's Government to Resolve the Issue of Repairing and Supplying New Agricultural Implements
(I)
    To the Editor: The broad masses of farmers in Hebei Province universally request to purchase new agricultural implements in order to improve cultivation techniques. However, when the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory distributes new agricultural implements, it does not include the necessary parts, so that when parts of some new agricultural implements break, they cannot be repaired or replaced. This has already affected the promotion of new agricultural implements.
    Over the past two years, our province has ordered 480 sets of three-pronged light weeders from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory. At that time, the factory, due to limited production conditions, did not equip them with sufficient parts, saying that they would be supplemented later. Now, most of the weeders have been sold to farmers on credit, but the parts have not yet been supplemented. In this way, certain effects of the weeders cannot be brought into play. In 1951, we ordered 150 small chaff cutters from the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, which also did not include wrenches and spare moving blades due to limited production conditions at that time. We could only sell them to farmers on credit in this way. The moving blades originally installed on these chaff cutters become dull after cutting more than 1,000 catties of grass; but without extra moving blades, they cannot be replaced. The edge of the fixed blade is polished smooth, but without a wrench, it cannot be disassembled and repaired. The masses are very dissatisfied and say, "We spent so much money and bought a piece of junk." Thirty to forty households of farmers in Dingxian and Tongxian Prefectures requested to return the goods and get their money back, or exchange them for better machines.
    We have reflected the above situation to the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory many times, and sent special personnel to the factory to discuss it in person. But the problem has not been resolved so far. This problem has affected the farmers' confidence in new agricultural implements and hindered the promotion of new agricultural implements. We hope the People's Daily will help to solve it.

    To the Editor: Farmers in Lucheng County, Shanxi Province, greatly appreciate new agricultural implements. This spring, farmers in Lucheng County purchased more than 200 Liberation-style waterwheels and 130 new-style seven-inch walking plows, and recently proposed to purchase more than 200 new-style plows. However, their new agricultural implements are sometimes damaged, and sometimes they lose parts, and they cannot find a place to repair them. They urgently request the government to establish a new agricultural implement repair and supply station in Lucheng County.
    In May this year, the "plow base" of a new-style seven-inch walking plow in Huangchi Village, Second District, was damaged. The farmers sent the plow to the County Cooperative Union, requesting them to repair it. The County Cooperative Union could not repair it and asked the Changzhi Prefectural Cooperative Union for instructions. A comrade from the Production Materials Section of the Prefectural Cooperative replied: "To get a 'plow base', you have to go to the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union." Until now, this walking plow is still left unrepaired. Fourteen old waterwheels in the Fifth District cannot be installed and used because they are missing parts such as screw wrenches and rubber pads. According to our understanding, this situation is quite common in our county. Therefore, many farmers reflect: "New agricultural implements are very good, and we are willing to pay to buy them, but there is no way to repair them when they are broken." "It costs hundreds of thousands of yuan to buy a new agricultural implement, and it is useless if a small part is broken." They say: "It would be great if a new agricultural implement repair and supply station could be established in the county, so that new agricultural implements could be repaired or parts replaced at any time when they are broken or lost!"
    We believe that the farmers' request in our county is completely justified. In the future, new agricultural implements will be promoted more and more, and the situation of damage or loss of parts is inevitable. The relevant leading authorities should pay attention to this issue and quickly find ways to solve it. Otherwise, this will affect the promotion of new agricultural implements and prevent some of the damaged new agricultural implements from playing their due role in production.

    Editor's Note: The letters from readers Zhu Zhiru and Song Yingbo, etc., reflect the farmers' urgent desire to solve the problems of repairing new agricultural implements and supplying parts. This requirement is completely justified. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government should pay attention to it.
    The broad masses of farmers have gradually recognized the role of new agricultural implements and have purchased and used them one after another. This is a good phenomenon. However, the structure of new agricultural implements is relatively complicated, and farmers cannot repair them or supply parts themselves. This problem needs to be helped by the government and agricultural implement factories. We believe that agricultural machinery manufacturing institutions should distribute the necessary parts when distributing new agricultural implements in the future. People's governments at all levels should set up new agricultural implement repair and supply stations according to actual needs, and repair the damaged new agricultural implements for farmers in a timely manner.

### 河北省和山西潞城县的农民  要求人民政府解决新式农具的修配问题

    河北省和山西潞城县的农民
    要求人民政府解决新式农具的修配问题
   （一）
    编辑同志：河北省广大农民普遍要求购买新式农具，以便改良耕作技术。但是，华北农业机械总厂在发售新农具时，没有附发必要的零件，以致某些新式农具的零件坏了，无法修配。这已经影响了新式农具的推广工作。
    我省两年来先后向华北农业机械总厂订购四百八十部三齿轻便耘锄。当时该厂因生产条件限制，没有配备足够的零件，说是以后补发。现在大部耘锄都已贷销到农民手里，而零件仍未补发。这样，耘锄的某些效用就无法发挥了。一九五一年我们向华北农业机械厂订购了一百五十台小型铡草机，该厂当时也因为生产条件限制，没有附发搬手和备用的动刀片。我们就只能这样贷销给农民。这种铡草机上原安的动刀片，铡了一千多斤草，就不快了；但没有多余的动刀片就不能换。定刀的刀刃磨光了，但没有搬手也不能拆卸修理。群众很不满意地说：“我们花了这么多钱，就买了一个废物。”定县、通县两个专区就有三四十户农民要求退货还钱，或者另换好机器。
    以上情况，我们曾多次向华北农业机械总厂反映，并且派专人到该厂去面谈。但问题至今没有解决。这个问题已经影响了农民对新式农具的信心，阻碍了新式农具的推广工作。希望人民日报协助解决。

    编辑同志：山西潞城县农民十分喜爱新式农具。今年春季，潞城县农民购买了二百多部解放式水车，一百三十张新式七吋步犁，最近又提出要购买二百多张新式犁。但是，他们的新式农具有时损坏了，有时丢了零件，找不到地方修理，他们迫切要求政府在潞城县成立一个新式农具修配所。
    今年五月间，二区黄池村有一张新式七吋步犁的“犁基”坏了，农民把这张犁送到县合作社联合社来，要求给他们修理。县联社没法修理，就向长治专区合作社联合社请示。专区合作社生产资料科同志答复说：“要配‘犁基’，得到山西省合作社联合社。”直到现在，这张步犁还是放着没有修理。五区有十四部旧水车，因为缺少螺丝搬手、胶皮垫等零件，都没法安装使用。据我们了解，这种情况在我县是相当普遍的。因此，很多农民反映：“新式农具很好，出钱买也愿意，就是坏了没办法。”“买一件新式农具要好几十万元，坏了一点就没用了。”他们说：“要是在县里成立一个新式农具修配所，新式农具坏了或丢了零件随时能修配，这该多好！”
    我们认为：我县农民这种要求是完全正当的。今后新式农具将日益推广，损坏或丢失零件的情况是不可避免的。有关领导机关应该重视这个问题，迅速设法解决。不然，这将会影响新式农具的推广，并使一部分损坏了的新式农具无法在生产中发挥应有的作用。

    编者按：读者朱志儒和宋英波等的来信，反映了农民要求解决新式农具的修理和零件配置问题的迫切心情。这种要求是完全正当的。中央人民政府农业部应该加以重视。
    广大农民逐渐认识了新式农具的作用，纷纷购用新式农具，这是一种好现象。但是，新式农具的构造比较复杂，农民自己不能修理和配置零件。这个问题需要政府和农具工厂帮助解决。我们认为，今后农业机械制造机构在发售新式农具时，应该配售必要的零件。各级人民政府应根据实际需要，设立新式农具修配所，及时地为农民修理损坏了的新式农具。
