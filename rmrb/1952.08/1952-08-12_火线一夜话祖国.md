A Night on the Front Lines Talking About the Motherland
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Ming

    It was a summer evening after a rain, the sky full of stars, a cool breeze blowing, and the lush trees on the hillside exuded a fresh scent. I followed a familiar person who had just arrived from the motherland in a jeep heading to the front lines. He brought the囑託 (zhǔ tuō: entrustment) and expectations of the people of the motherland; he brought the good news of the rapid progress on the production and construction front of the motherland; he brought the infinite power of our great motherland that is growing stronger day by day. Tonight, he would tell all of this to his old comrades-in-arms who he had been separated from for more than half a year. This person was Li Xuesan, the head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation returning to China.

    The jeep raced along the newly built road, climbing over steep mountain ridges, and the heroic Maliangshan position was right in front of us. Firelight flickered in the night sky from time to time, artillery shells exploded not far away; crisp gunshots often rang out from the hillside, the anti-aircraft guns that drove the "Black Widow" crazy. B-26 night bomber planes circled aimlessly. This jeep, carrying the great trust of the people of the motherland, sometimes turned on its headlights and sped forward, and sometimes turned off its lights to advance.

    The car stopped at the foot of a hill. In the starlight, the masters guarding this line of defense rushed forward to shake hands tightly with this person bearing a great mission. We were led up the mountain, and then up a series of steps. The long-awaited people greeted Commander Li Xuesan with enthusiastic cheers and applause. Our eyes were almost dazzled by the intense light of the gasoline lamp. The applause grew louder and louder, and a female soldier presented a bouquet of flowers to this envoy of the people of the motherland who had returned to the front lines. It was half past ten.

    The gasoline lamp illuminated the "underground auditorium," which was hung with a portrait of Chairman Mao and filled with more than five hundred people. It was not easy to gather so many people together on the front lines. Many representatives came from dozens of miles away, crossing enemy fire blockade lines, including representatives from the heroic positions of Maliangshan and Fenghuoshan; there were also representatives from the anti-aircraft artillery units that shot down or damaged seventeen enemy planes in thirteen days. They used their heroic fighting and victorious achievements to welcome their returning representatives. Many people opened notebooks on their laps. Obviously, they regarded this welcoming meeting as a vivid and profound patriotic education class. These people, who were as fierce as tigers in battle, now widened their eyes and appeared as gentle and simple as children.

    "I extend greetings to the comrades on behalf of the 500 million people of the motherland!" Commander Li Xuesan said these words to all the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army on the front lines, and these words aroused thunderous applause of gratitude.

    Commander Li Xuesan said that the people of the motherland gave the delegation a good education in revolutionary heroism, and the combat heroes and work models in the delegation received unparalleled love from the masses. Everywhere the returning representatives went, even the young children of the Young Pioneers asked: "Volunteer Army uncles, what merits have you made? Tell us your combat stories!" The people of the new China respect honor and love honor so much, and this has become the ethos of the new society. Deng Lingyun, the "Glorious Mother" of Changsha City, whose husband, eldest son, and youngest daughter were all labor models, work models, and study models. She herself was elected as a study model when she studied culture at an amateur school. Her second son, Yan Yi, participated in nine battles in Korea, made a great contribution, and honorably joined the Communist Party. When the good news of Yan Yi's meritorious service was sent from the front lines to his hometown, the chairman of the Provincial People's Government and the mayor of the Municipal People's Government personally went to congratulate him. This fifty-eight-year-old glorious mother wrote a letter to her son on the front lines, saying: "I hope you will continue to work hard, add merit to merit, and protect the mothers and children of the world." A Volunteer Army family member in Guiding County, Guizhou Province, who had been emancipated after the land reform, wanted the returning representative to send a letter to his son, saying: "The family lacks nothing now, except for a certificate of merit; kill more American devils, and write a certificate of merit to send home."

    The patriotic labor enthusiasm on the production front of the motherland and the spirit of heroic fighting on the Korean battlefield are closely linked. Commander Li Xuesan said: On the wall of a workshop in a glass factory in Northeast China, there was a letter framed in glass. This letter was written by an artilleryman of the Volunteer Army to Sun Deyou, an advanced worker in the factory, in October last year. After receiving the letter, Sun Deyou's team held a discussion meeting that night and decided to respond to the Volunteer Army comrades with practical actions to increase production. The next day, Sun Deyou's team cut ten more boxes of glass, and then created even higher records. The immortal deeds of Communist Party member Li Wensheng and Liu Honglin, mining workers who risked their lives to save an electric drill, mentioned by Commander Li in his report; the exemplary case of the nine heroes in the construction of the Tianlan Railway in the Northwest, who persisted in their work even after being trapped in the collapsed tunnel for several days; and the selfless heroic behavior of Dong Fusheng, a labor model in Yunnan, who braved temperatures of 1,300 degrees Celsius to repair a Martin furnace, all deeply moved the soldiers. As the artilleryman wrote in his letter to the advanced worker Sun Deyou: "Let us work together to defend the motherland and eliminate the American aggressors!"

    It was very hot and stuffy in the cave, people were constantly sweating, the sound of artillery rumbled into the cave, and planes constantly flew low and circled, but all of this seemed not to exist, and people listened intently to the good news of the great construction of the motherland and the improvement of the people's lives. Commander Li Xuesan introduced the general situation of the motherland's national defense construction and economic construction, and said: "After only three years of construction, the living standards of the people in our motherland have been greatly improved. Now, unemployment has been basically eliminated in the Northeast; in 1951, the wages of workers increased by 15.3 percent compared to 1950. The total amount of cloth sold by the North China State-Owned Department Store in 1950 was 4.86 million bolts, which increased to 7.29 million bolts in 1951, and it is estimated that 12.6 million bolts can be sold in 1952, which shows that the purchasing power of the working people has greatly increased..." These outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland who were fighting on the front lines listened and smiled with satisfaction. The slogan posted in the venue: "The achievements of the motherland's construction are our greatest happiness!" fully expressed the soldiers' feelings!

    "Our motherland is great and prosperous, and every inch of land is lovely. Let us always be defenders of the motherland and defenders of peace!" Commander Li Xuesan ended his five-hour report with these words full of love and pride for the motherland. The soldiers' representatives expressed their firm response to his sacred call with lasting applause.

    A representative attending the meeting stood in front of everyone and spoke. He said: "Listening for a whole night is like personally taking a trip to the motherland. Today, the 500 million people of the motherland are of one heart, and our entire Volunteer Army is also of one heart. The front and the rear are connected like one person, and we will surely achieve greater victories in the cause of defending the motherland and defending world peace!"

    The jeep raced again on the road on the front lines. It was already half past three in the morning. Teams of soldiers who had not slept all night returned to their positions in the moist thick fog of the early morning. The motherland's intentions aroused a solemn echo in the hearts of the soldiers - "Repay the people of the motherland with victorious battles!"

    火线一夜话祖国
    新华社记者  刘鸣
    这是一个雨后初晴的夏晚，繁星满空，凉爽的轻风迎面吹来，山坡上茂密的丛树散发出清新的气息，我跟随一个很熟悉的新从祖国来的人乘着吉普车驶往前线。他带来了祖国人民的嘱托与期望；带来了祖国生产建设战线上飞跃猛进的捷音；带来了我们伟大祖国日益强大的无穷无尽的力量。就在今天晚上，他要把这一切告诉给分别了半年多的老战友们。这个人就是中国人民志愿军归国代表团团长李雪三。
    吉普车沿着新修成的公路奔驰，爬过一座座险陡的山岭，英雄的马良山阵地就在眼前了。夜空中不时地闪耀着火光，炮弹在不远处爆炸着；山岗上常常发出清脆的枪声，这就是气死“黑寡妇”的防空枪。B二六夜航轰炸机在不停地盲目盘旋着。这辆背负着祖国人民重托的吉普车有时开亮大灯快跑一程，有时熄了灯向前开进。
    车子在一个山坡下停住了。在星夜里，守卫在这一线阵地上的主人抢上前来，和这位承担着重大使命的人紧紧地握手了。我们被引导着走上山去，又走了一级级阶梯。期待已久的人们用一阵热烈的欢呼和掌声把李雪三团长迎接进去。我们的眼睛几乎被汽油灯的强度光亮炫耀得睁不开来。掌声越来越响亮了，一位女战士捧上一束鲜花，献给这位重回前线的祖国人民的使者。这时正十点半钟。
    汽油灯把这间挂着毛主席像、坐满了五百多人的“地下礼堂”照得通明。在前线上集中这么多的人在一起是不容易的，许多代表都是从几十里外越过了多少敌人炮火封锁线来的，其中有从马良山、烽火山等英雄阵地来的代表；也有在十三天内击落击伤敌机十七架的高射炮部队的代表。他们是用自己的英勇战斗和胜利战果来迎接自己的归国代表的。很多人在膝头上打开了笔记本，很显然，他们把这次欢迎大会当作了一堂生动而深刻的爱国主义教育大课。这些打起仗来像猛虎一般的人，现在睁大着眼睛像孩子一般地温良和纯朴。
    “我代表祖国五万万人民向同志们问好！”李雪三团长这句话是向前线上所有志愿军指挥员、战斗员说的，这句话引起了春雷般的感激的掌声。
    李雪三团长说，祖国人民给代表团进行了很好的革命英雄主义的教育，代表团中的战斗英雄和工作模范们受到群众无比的爱戴。归国代表每到一处，连少年儿童队员都问：“志愿军叔叔，你立过什么功，给我们讲讲自己的战斗故事吧！”新中国的人民是如此尊重荣誉，热爱荣誉，这已经成为新社会的风气。长沙市“光荣的妈妈”邓龄云，她的丈夫、大儿子、小女儿都是劳动模范、工作模范和学习模范，她自己在业余学校学文化时也当选为学习模范。她的第二个儿子言义在朝鲜经过九次战斗，立了一大功，还光荣地参加了共产党。当言义的立功喜报从前线寄到家乡时，省人民政府主席、市人民政府市长都亲去贺喜。这位五十八岁的光荣妈妈写信给前线上的儿子说：“希望你继续努力，功上加功，保卫全世界的妈妈和孩子。”贵州省贵定县一位土地改革后翻身的志愿军家属要归国代表捎信给他儿子说：“家里现在什么也不缺，就是缺一张立功喜报；多杀美国鬼子，写张喜报回家来。”
    祖国生产战线上的爱国主义劳动热情和朝鲜战场上的英勇战斗的精神是紧紧相联的。李雪三团长说：东北某玻璃工厂车间的墙壁上有一封用玻璃框子装起来的信，这封信是志愿军一个炮兵战士在去年十月间写给这个厂先进工人孙德友的。孙德友小组接信之后，当晚就开了个讨论会，决定以增加生产的实际行动来回答志愿军同志。第二天孙德友小组就多切了十箱玻璃，以后又创造了更高的纪录。李团长在报告中提到的采矿工人、共产党员李文生、刘洪林舍身抢救电镐的不朽事迹，西北修建天兰铁路中九勇士因隧道崩塌而堵在洞里冻了几天还坚持工作的模范事例，云南劳动模范董福生冒着摄氏一千三百度的高温抢修马丁炉的忘我的英雄行为，都使战士们深受感动。正如那位炮兵战士给先进工人孙德友的信上写的：“我们共同努力，保卫祖国，消灭美国侵略者！”
    洞子里闷热得很，人身上不断地出汗，炮声隆隆地传进洞来，飞机不断地在低飞盘旋，但这一切似乎并不存在，人们心神贯注地听着祖国的伟大建设和人民生活改善的喜讯。李雪三团长介绍了祖国的国防建设、经济建设的概况，又说：“我们祖国经过仅仅三年的建设，人民的生活水平已经大大提高了，现在东北已经基本上消灭了失业现象；一九五一年的职工工资比一九五零年提高百分之十五点三。华北国营百货公司一九五零年卖布总额是四百八十六万匹，一九五一年增到七百二十九万匹，一九五二年预计可卖一千二百六十万匹，这说明劳动人民的购买力大大提高了。……”这些战斗在前线的祖国的优秀子弟都听得满意地笑了。那一幅贴在会场上的标语：“祖国建设的成就，是我们最大的幸福！”就充分地表达出了战士们的这种心情！
    “我们的祖国是伟大的、富强的，每一寸土地都是可爱的。让我们永远作一个祖国的保卫者、和平的保卫者！”李雪三团长用这句充满了对祖国的热爱和自豪感的话结束了他长达五个钟头的报告。战士代表们用经久不息的鼓掌来表示坚决响应他的神圣的号召。
    一个到会的代表站到大家面前发言了。他说：“听了一夜，好比亲自到祖国去走了一趟，今天，祖国五万万人民一条心，我们全体志愿军也一条心，前方后方连结得像一个人一样，一定能在保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的事业中，取得更大的胜利！”
    吉普车又飞驰在前线的公路上，这时已经是早晨三点半了。一队队一夜未睡的战士们在清晨湿润的浓雾中回到自己的阵地。祖国的心意在战士们心中激起了一个庄严的回响——“用胜利的战斗来答谢祖国人民！”
