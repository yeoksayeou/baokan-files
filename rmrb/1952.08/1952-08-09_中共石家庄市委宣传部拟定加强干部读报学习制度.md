    The Propaganda Department of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the CPC Plans to Strengthen the System of Cadres Reading Newspapers and Studying
    Editor: The letter from comrades Fang Jingni and Xiao Yiping, published in the "Letters from Readers" column on July 26, criticizing the neglect of newspaper reading and study by cadres in various organizations in Shijiazhuang, is correct in our opinion. The political atmosphere in various organizations in Shijiazhuang is thin, and cadres generally neglect current affairs study. This serious phenomenon has not been corrected for a long time, and the main responsibility lies with the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to the newspaper reading work of cadres, because we did not deeply understand that the Party newspaper is a weapon to guide actual struggle and an important tool to educate and improve the political and ideological level of cadres. Therefore, our leadership in the current affairs study of cadres in various organizations was not in-depth, and we did not regularly conduct inspections and supervision, which allowed some cadres' purely professional viewpoints and tendencies of not asking about politics to grow.
    In order to correct the phenomenon of cadres in various organizations, factories, and mines neglecting newspaper reading and study, we have formulated the following measures: 1. Party committees at all levels should conduct repeated ideological mobilization among cadres, criticize various erroneous ideas of not caring about current affairs study, educate everyone to recognize the importance of newspaper reading and study, and list newspaper reading and study as an indispensable part of cadres' daily political life. 2. Make full use of the strength of propaganda officers in the organizations, and define doing a good job in cadres' current affairs study as one of the important tasks of propaganda officers in the organizations. 3. The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee, the Party Committees of various organizations and factories and mines, and the District Committees shall establish regular systems of current affairs reports, tests, and inspections to strengthen the leadership of cadres' newspaper reading and study. The Propaganda Department of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the CPC

### 中共石家庄市委宣传部拟定加强干部读报学习制度

    中共石家庄市委宣传部拟定加强干部读报学习制度
    编辑同志：七月二十六日“读者来信”栏刊载了方景尼、萧一平同志批评石家庄市各机关干部忽视读报学习的信件，我们认为这个批评是正确的。石家庄市各机关政治空气稀薄，干部普遍忽视时事学习，这种严重现象长期没有得到纠正，主要应由市委宣传部负责。过去我们确实没有重视机关干部的读报工作，这是因为我们没有深刻地领会党报是指导实际斗争的武器，是教育和提高干部政治思想水平的重要工具；因此，我们对于各机关干部时事学习的领导很不深入，没有经常地进行检查督促，以致使得某些干部的单纯业务观点、不问政治的倾向得以滋长。
    为了纠正各机关、厂矿干部忽视读报学习的现象，我们拟定了下列的办法：一、各级党委应在干部中进行反复的思想动员，批判各种不关心时事学习的错误思想，教育大家认识读报学习的重要意义，把读报学习列为干部日常政治生活中不可缺少的一项。二、充分使用机关宣传员的力量，把搞好干部时事学习定为机关宣传员的重要任务之一。三、市委宣传部、各机关厂矿党委、区委建立定期的时事报告、测验、检查等制度，加强对干部读报学习的领导。  中共石家庄市委宣传部
