    Gao Yubao Writes a Book
    (Based on Gao Yubao's "How I Learned Culture and Writing?")
    Chen Xinghua, Artist
    Sixteen. Comrade Chi Zhiyuan, the Propaganda and Education Section Chief of the regiment, made a deal with me in order to educate us: he would ask me to tell an old story, and he would tell us a new book – "The History of Social Development." We were greatly educated, and I resolved to study hard.
    Seventeen. In August 1949, the troops were stationed north of Changsha, and I was a military postal worker. I borrowed a comic book "Young Mao Zedong" drawn by Comrade Mi Gu from a child. When I saw the passage, "Chairman Mao liked to read old novels when he was young. One day, he suddenly had a question: Why are the protagonists in the novels he reads always civil officials, military generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women, and you never see a farmer?" I thought: Yes, I have also read a lot of old books, why haven't poor people ever written a book?
    Eighteen. I felt that the stories of those civil officials, military generals, flying over eaves and walking on walls were unreasonable, so it was better to read new books. I burned all the old books I had with me.

    十六、团宣教股长迟志远同志，为了教育我们，和我订出了交换条件：他叫我讲一段旧书，他就给我们讲一段新书——“社会发展史”。我们受到很大教育，我决心努力学习。
    十七、一九四九年八月，部队住在长沙北面，我当军邮员。我向小孩子借了一本米谷同志画的“少年毛泽东”的连环图画来看，看到“毛主席少年的时候很好看旧小说。有一天他忽然发生了一个疑问：他所读的小说中，主人翁为什么总是文臣武将，才子佳人，永远看不见一个耕田汉？”这一段话时，我想：是呀，我也看了好多旧书，为什么穷人没出过一本书呢？
    十八、我觉得那些文臣武将，飞檐走壁的故事没有什么道理，不如看新书。我把身边所有的旧书，全部烧掉了。
