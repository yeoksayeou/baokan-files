    Self-Criticism Regarding Poor Asphalt Packaging During Transportation
    Comrade Editor: The People's Daily published on July 22nd, Shi Zhenhua's criticism of our office's poor asphalt packaging during transportation, which resulted in two worker poisoning accidents. This criticism is entirely correct. Last year, we planned to switch to using iron drums and pine wood boxes to pack the asphalt, but due to a shortage of packaging materials, it was not resolved. To avoid worker burns during handling, we have now changed the packaging from straw bags to two layers of burlap bags, and we prepare ointment and gas masks for each handling. The straw-bagged packaging sent to the Xi'an Trust Company on June 13th was shipped from the Northeast before the packaging change. Although we took some preventive measures beforehand during delivery (such as wearing gas masks and applying ointment to the face), we still failed to completely ensure the safety of workers during loading and unloading, resulting in another worker burn incident. This shows that our work still suffers from carelessness and bureaucratic work styles. In addition to sincerely accepting this criticism, the responsible cadres have made self-criticisms, guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur again in the future.

    对运输沥青时包装不良的检讨
    编辑同志：七月二十二日人民日报登载了史振华对我处运输沥青时包装不好、发生两次工人中毒事故的批评，这个批评是完全正确的。去年我们曾拟改用铁桶和松木箱子装沥青，但因缺少包装原料，未获解决。为了在搬运中避免烧伤工人事故，现已将草袋改用两层麻袋包装，并在每次搬运中都预备擦面药膏和防毒面具。六月十三日发往西安信托公司的草袋包装，是在未改包装前由东北发来的，在发货时，虽在事前做了些预防工作（如带防毒面具、面部涂药），但仍未能彻底保证工人在装卸中的安全，以致又发生烧伤工人事件，这说明我们在工作中还存在粗枝大叶和官僚主义作风。我们除诚恳地接受这一批评外，负责干部已做检讨，保证今后不再发生类似事件。
