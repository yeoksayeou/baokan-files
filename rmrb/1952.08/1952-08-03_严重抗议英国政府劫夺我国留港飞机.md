    Severely Protest the British Government's Seizure of Our Aircraft Left in Hong Kong
    The British Privy Council illegally "ruled" on July 28th to grant the forty aircraft of the China National Aviation Corporation left in Hong Kong to the American imperialist element, Chennault; at midnight on the 28th, the British Hong Kong government used force to seize all seventy aircraft of our China and Central Aviation Corporations left in Hong Kong, as well as two warehouses containing aircraft parts, and beat and arrested our property protection staff. The Chinese people express boundless indignation at this illegal and tyrannical behavior of the British government and fully support the serious protest statement made by Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu.
    Premier Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government solemnly declared as early as December 3, 1949, that the seventy aircraft of the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Aviation Corporation left in Hong Kong are the national property of our People's Republic of China, and no one is allowed to infringe, move, or damage them by any means. This statement expressed the firm will of all the Chinese people to resolutely safeguard the state property left in Hong Kong.
    However, for more than two years, the British government has deliberately seized the aircraft of our two airlines left in Hong Kong, adopting various illegal means and playing various conspiratorial tricks. It initially prevented our aircraft from flying back to the motherland, then accepted the "lawsuit" of the American imperialist element, Chennault, condoned Kuomintang special agent bandits in destroying seven aircraft, and even ordered "detention," forcibly seizing them. Recently, it has openly seized the property of our People's Republic of China and handed over forty aircraft to American imperialist elements.
    The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate this attitude of the British government in following the United States and being hostile to the People's Republic of China, and it is completely contrary to the wishes of the British people. Therefore, it will inevitably be opposed by the British people. We want to solemnly warn the British government to immediately return all the property left in Hong Kong belonging to our two airlines, and guarantee the freedom and safety of our property protection staff, and must not infringe upon them, otherwise, you will surely suffer the consequences!

### 严重抗议英国政府劫夺我国留港飞机

    严重抗议英国政府劫夺我国留港飞机
    英国枢密院于七月二十八日非法“判决”将我中央航空公司留在香港的四十架飞机，给予美帝国主义分子陈纳德；二十八日午夜，香港英国政府又以武力劫夺我中国和中央两航空公司留在香港的全部飞机七十架和存置飞机零件的两个仓库，并且殴打拘捕我护产员工。我国人民对于英国政府这种非法的横暴的行为，表示无比愤慨，并完全拥护外交部章汉夫副部长严重抗议的声明。
    我中央人民政府周恩来总理在一九四九年十二月三日早已郑重声明，中国航空公司和中央航空公司留在香港的七十架飞机，是我中华人民共和国国家财产，决不容许任何人以任何手段侵犯、移动和损坏。这个声明表示了全中国人民坚决维护留港国家财产的意志。
    然而，两年多来，英国政府蓄意劫夺我两航空公司留港的飞机，采取种种非法手段，玩弄种种阴谋花样。它始而阻止我国飞机飞回祖国，继而受理美帝国主义分子陈纳德的“讼案”，放纵国民党特务匪徒破坏七架飞机，以至下令“扣押”，强加劫持，最近，竟公然劫夺我中华人民共和国的财产，把四十架飞机交给美帝国主义分子。
    英国政府这种追随美国、敌视中华人民共和国的态度，是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的，也是和英国人民的愿望完全相违背的，因此，也必将受到英国人民的反对。我们要严正的警告英国政府，立即将属于我国所有的两航空公司留港全部财产交还，并保证我护产员工的自由和安全，不得加以侵犯，否则，你们必将自食其果！
