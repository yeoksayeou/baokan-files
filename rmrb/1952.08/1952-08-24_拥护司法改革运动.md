    Supporting the Judicial Reform Movement

    To the Editor: We were very excited to read the report in the People's Daily on August 17th regarding the "Nationwide Launch of the Judicial Reform Movement." We are law students. Through our studies, we have come to a deep understanding that judicial work is an important link in the people's democratic dictatorship. Through judicial work, the people can sanction lawbreakers, stabilize social order, and better promote economic construction. If there are still serious impurities within our judicial organs, it will not only bring suffering to the people, but also damage the large-scale economic construction that our country is about to begin. Therefore, we support this judicial reform movement. We hope that through this reform movement, judicial work will be greatly improved, and our machine of dictatorship will be strengthened. We are willing to further our studies, transform our thinking, establish a viewpoint of serving the people, and prepare to dedicate ourselves to judicial work.

    拥护司法改革运动
    编辑同志：当我们读了八月十七日人民日报上关于“全国将展开司法改革运动”的报道后，感到非常兴奋。我们是学法律的。我们在学习中深刻认识到，司法工作是人民民主专政的重要一环；通过司法工作，人民把那些不法分子加以制裁，使社会秩序安定，经济建设工作也才能更好地开展。如果在我们司法机关中，仍然存在着严重的不纯现象，它不仅给人民带来了痛苦，也将会破坏我们国家即将开始的大规模的经济建设。因此，我们拥护这一司法改革运动。我们盼望通过这一改革运动，使司法工作大大提高一步，使我们的专政机器强化起来。我们愿意更进一步地努力学习，改造思想，树立为人民服务的观点，准备献身于司法工作。
