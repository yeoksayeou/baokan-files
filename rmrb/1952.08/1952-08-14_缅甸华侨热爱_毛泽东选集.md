    (Xinhua News Agency, 9th) Rangoon dispatch: The second volume of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" has recently been put on sale in Rangoon. The Overseas Chinese bookstore selling this classic work of the Chinese revolution is twice as busy as usual. Overseas Chinese compatriots with purchase coupons rushed to buy them. An elderly Overseas Chinese worker specially brought a piece of silk cloth to carefully wrap the purchased "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" in it.

    Many Burmese and Indian expatriates came to the bookstore to admire the portrait of Chairman Mao and the "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung," reluctant to leave. A Burmese woman asked the bookstore staff to register her for the purchase of the complete set of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" and insisted on prepaying the full amount.

    缅甸华侨热爱“毛泽东选集”
    【新华社九日讯】仰光消息：“毛泽东选集”第二卷最近在仰光发售。出售这本中国革命经典著作的华侨书店比常日加倍热闹。持有购书券的侨胞们赶往争先购买。一位华侨老工人特别携带了一幅绸布，把购得的“毛泽东选集”珍重地包在绸布里。
    许多缅甸人和印度侨民到书店里瞻仰毛主席像和“毛泽东选集”，依依不愿离去。一位缅甸妇女要求书店职员替她登记购买“毛泽东选集”全套，并坚决要预付书款全部。
