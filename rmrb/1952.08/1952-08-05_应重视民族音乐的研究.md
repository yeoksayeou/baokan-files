    Research on National Music Should Be Emphasized

    Editor's Note: Here are two letters concerning the issue of how musical work should inherit the excellent national tradition. This issue should be universally valued by music circles everywhere. We hope that relevant leading departments in various regions, like the Cultural Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, will organize forces to conduct research and discussions in a planned manner to promote the development of musical work.

    To the Editor: We agree with the opinions expressed in the article "Some Opinions on the Issue of Inheriting the Excellent National Tradition in Musical Work" by Xu Guangyi and others, published in the People's Daily on June 5th, regarding the importance of studying the national musical heritage. However, there are some issues with the specific methods proposed by the author of that article. The Shanghai music community, after the conclusion of the literary rectification campaign, will hold a series of symposiums to discuss how to accept the national musical heritage in the future. Our department is also studying how to organize a national music research institute to promote the research of national music in various regions. We will forward the opinions of the masses and our department to you at that time.
    East China Military and Political Committee Cultural Department

    To the Editor: I am a music enthusiast and used to be involved in cultural work in rural areas. After reading the article "Some Opinions on the Issue of Inheriting the Excellent National Tradition in Musical Work" by Comrade Xu Guangyi and others, published in the People's Daily, I would also like to express some opinions on this issue.

    I feel that some schools (especially universities and colleges) currently have an erroneous tendency to belittle the national artistic heritage and folk art in their musical work, which has not been adequately criticized. For example, they are unwilling to sing Chinese songs, considering them "too simple," "without harmony," and "unable to be sung in four parts." The fact that "our nation has a glorious and excellent tradition in culture" is merely an empty concept in their minds.

    The most serious thing is that our literary and art workers also tend to belittle the national artistic tradition. They have not seriously studied folk music, and the leadership has not strengthened leadership and organizational work, so in recent years, there have been very few good works produced with Chinese national characteristics that are popular with the people.

    In terms of musical instruments, there is also a general tendency to blindly worship Western instruments and disregard national instruments. For example, in recent years, some operas, even small-scale operas, specify the use of: first violin, second violin... for musical accompaniment. The amateur troupes organized by workers and peasants themselves are frightened away at first glance, because they are familiar with and good at using Chinese national instruments. The adaptation and creation of folk instrumental music are indeed too scarce. Many Chinese music enthusiasts and Chinese music performance groups feel that there are no pieces to play, while some works with feudal colors and passive decadence are circulating instead. This phenomenon should be corrected in a timely manner. Therefore, I suggest that our music circles should organize everyone to conduct research, sorting, reform, and creation of national music in a planned manner, create new songs with national style that can reflect reality, and systematically introduce the art of our nation.

### 应重视民族音乐的研究

专栏：读者来信

    应重视民族音乐的研究
    编者按：这里发表的是两封关于音乐工作如何继承民族优良传统问题的来信。这一问题应该受到各地音乐界的普遍重视。我们希望各地有关领导部门都像华东军政委员会文化部一样，组织力量，有计划地进行研究和讨论，以推动音乐工作的发展。编辑同志：我们同意人民日报六月五日刊登的“我们对音乐工作继承民族优良传统问题的一些意见”一文中关于重视研究民族音乐遗产的意见。但该文作者所提出的具体作法，还有一些问题。上海音乐界在文艺整风结束后，将召开一系列座谈会来讨论今后如何接受民族音乐遗产的问题，本部亦正在研究如何组织民族音乐研究室来推动各地对民族音乐的研究工作，届时再将群众意见及本部的意见转给你们。  华东军政委员会文化部
    编辑同志：我是一个音乐爱好者，过去曾在农村搞过文艺工作。读了人民日报所发表的许光毅等同志的“我们对音乐工作继承民族优良传统问题的一些意见”后，我也来发表一些关于这个问题的意见。
    我觉得目前有些学校（特别是大学和专科学校）在音乐工作上存在着的轻视民族艺术遗产和民间文艺的错误倾向，没有得到应有的批判。如他们不愿唱中国歌，认为“太简单”、“没和声”，“不能唱四部”。“我们民族在文化上有光辉的优良的传统”这一事实在他们心目中只是空洞的概念。
    最严重的是我们文艺工作者也有轻视民族艺术传统的倾向，他们没有认真地研究过民间音乐，领导上也没有加强领导和组织工作，所以近来很少产生富有中国民族气派，为人民所喜闻乐见的好作品。
    在乐器方面，也普遍存在着盲目崇拜西洋和不重视民族乐器的倾向，如近年来一些歌剧，甚至小型歌剧的音乐伴奏，也都标明使用：第一小提琴，第二小提琴……。工人，农民自己组织的业余剧团一看就吓回去了，因为他们所熟悉的和善于使用的是中国民族乐器。民间器乐曲的改编和创作，的确太贫乏，许多国乐爱好者和国乐演奏团体都感到没有乐曲可奏，而一些带有封建色彩的消极颓废的作品反而在流行着。这种现象应该及时得到纠正。因此，我建议：我们音乐界应有组织地发动大家来进行研究、整理、改革和创造民族音乐的工作，创造具有民族作风而能反映现实的新乐曲，有系统地介绍我们民族的艺术。  王钰龙
