    Promote the Exchange of Goods Between Urban and Rural Areas, and Persistently Launch Patriotic Labor Competitions

    (Excerpts from a speech at the East China Trade Department's Cycling Red Flag Labor Competition Award Ceremony)

    Since the "Three-Anti" campaign, the East China Trade Department's various departments have made great achievements in restoring business and promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have basically come to a victorious conclusion. The "three evils" and "five poisons" that endangered the country's economic construction have been basically eliminated. The labor enthusiasm and ideological understanding of workers and peasants have also been greatly improved. The industrial production increase and agricultural bumper harvest movements have also achieved remarkable results. Therefore, how to further deepen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, strive for a more widespread and healthy prosperity in the entire region's market, and create favorable conditions for the movement to increase production and practice economy and for the country's large-scale construction, has become one of our current urgent central tasks. Because only by expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and enlivening the market can the products of farmers in the patriotic bumper harvest movement find sales outlets, increase farmers' purchasing power, increase farmers' enthusiasm for expanding reproduction, and provide a strong guarantee for the raw materials needed for industrial production and the sales market for industrial products, thereby promoting the normal development of industrial and agricultural production and enabling the entire national economy to be rapidly improved and prospered, and strengthening the work of the trade departments is one of the main keys to completing this major central task.

    Comrade Stalin once clearly pointed out the role of Soviet commerce in stimulating agricultural production through urban-rural exchange: "In order to make the national economic life very active, and to stimulate industry and agriculture to continuously expand production, there is another condition, that is, the expanded commodity circulation between cities and villages, between regions and regions, between provinces and provinces, and between various departments of the national economy." (Stalin: "Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the Seventeenth Party Congress.")

    Lenin also affirmed the importance of trade work in the early days of the New Economic Policy with high praise: "Commerce is the link that the Communist Party, which occupies a leading position, 'must seize with all its strength' in the chain of historical events... Otherwise, we will not be able to grasp the entire chain, and socialist social and economic relations cannot be established."

    The truth indicated by Lenin and Stalin is now fully proven in the specific practice of our New Democratic economy.

    The East China Bureau and the East China Military and Political Committee recently decided to take "vigorously developing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and enlivening the market" as one of the central tasks of the entire party and governments at all levels in East China in the second half of this year, and called on leading cadres at all levels to strengthen their leadership over commercial work and earnestly change the past tendency of some cadres to only value industrial and agricultural production and ignore commerce. This decision is completely correct and necessary today and is a fundamental guarantee for the victorious implementation of the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The main reason why our Party and the People's Government attach so much importance to trade work today and place trade work in such an important position is because trade work has its special and significant meaning for the development of the entire national economy today. Therefore, comrades working in the trade departments should have a deeper understanding and clear understanding of their work, and should raise a high sense of responsibility for the glorious tasks entrusted to each of you, and work together with other departments to complete the central task of expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and enlivening the market. It is undeniable that after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the comrades in the East China trade departments have generally improved in their ideology and understanding, clearly drawn ideological boundaries, and criticized capitalist business ideology. These progress and improvements have been demonstrated in the recent period by various state-owned trade units in implementing policies and completing tasks, which is very good. However, it is undeniable that the thinking of "rather be left than right" and "taking everything over" still exists; and capitalist business ideology is still quite serious. The phenomenon of only talking about tasks and not valuing policies; only caring about departmental interests and not caring about overall interests has not been completely overcome; the supply system mentality in management, not caring about the people's property, and causing losses and waste is still quite common; and the phenomenon of formalism and coercion is developing in some places. Comrades in trade work at all levels in East China must strive to correct these erroneous ideas and overcome the existing various undesirable phenomena in order to continue to move forward and improve on the existing basis, and victoriously complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the state.

    In order to give play to the labor enthusiasm and production creativity and initiative of the broad masses of workers and staff, to enable the country's trade policies to be deeply grasped by every grassroots work cadre and implemented in their work, and to ensure that work tasks can be correctly and overfulfilled, the East China Trade Department launched the patriotic circulating red flag labor competition on the basis of the masses' consciousness. This is a correct and good method. Through this red flag labor competition movement of various professional companies, we can deeply feel the huge power of this movement. According to the development of the movement in various units, the most common and significant manifestations of achievements are:

    1. Through the competition movement, the majority of units have completed or overfulfilled their work tasks under the principle of correctly implementing the policies of the People's Government; the originally relatively backward units have also made significant progress, and few deviations have occurred; even those that had deviations in the early stages have been promptly checked and corrected in this movement. For example, the East China Grain Company's wheat procurement work is one of the best-completed areas in the country. In the early stage of wheat procurement, due to untimely and insufficient inspection, insufficient understanding of the spirit of wheat procurement in various places, some shortcomings were produced in regional price differences and procurement methods, and these deviations were generally checked and corrected in July; the China Industrial Equipment Company's East China Branch was able to correctly grasp the sales policy and price policy, which are all good examples.

    2. Through the competition movement, the political consciousness and ideological understanding of the comrades in various units have been significantly improved, the labor viewpoint and labor attitude of the working class have been established, and the enthusiasm and creativity in their work have been fully brought into play, and work efficiency has been generally improved. In particular, a large number of outstanding model cadres and advanced workers have emerged in the movement. Their model deeds not only reduced material losses for the country, saved huge expenses, and accumulated more wealth for the country; but also used their advanced experience and model behavior to drive other work comrades to actively move forward. According to preliminary statistics, the rationalization proposals put forward by various units have reached more than 3,000. Among them, the more prominent ones are: Lü Chóngpǔ of the Petroleum Company absorbed advanced Soviet experience and learned high-speed electric welding, which improved work efficiency by two to three times, and initially reversed the erroneous thinking of technical personnel worshiping the United States and Britain. The comrades of the Shanghai Transportation and Electrical Appliance Branch of the East China District Industrial Equipment Company learned from Soviet experience and adopted advanced loading methods, changing from loading one car per flat car (30 tons) to loading eight cars on three flat cars, and created a special springboard to replace the crane. Huang Yíxùn of the Grain Company proposed simplifying internal accounting procedures, saving the manpower of 30 to 40 people. For example, when a typhoon hit Shanghai in July, many office and warehouse comrades of the company automatically stayed up all night to do all the preparatory work to protect the people's property from loss. Comrades from the transportation department of the Department Store rushed to various docks and stations in the wind and rain to protect materials, persisted for two days and two nights, so that all materials were not damaged. These rationalization proposals are all the wisdom and creation of the working class; these excellent advanced workers are the most valuable talents of our country and the people's trade department. We believe that in the continued competition movement in the future, there will be more brilliant and more important creations.

    3. Through the competition movement, the capitalist business ideology of purely profit-making in various units has been reversed, and specific improvements have been made in the management methods and the organizational system of business work. Relying on the wisdom of the masses, many sales methods have been created, so that the cold and unpopular goods that have been backlogged for many years have been properly utilized and the sales problem has been solved. For example, the export of straw hats by the Native Products Company had been backlogged for more than two years and could not be sold. In this movement, after Liu Wénlóng and all the comrades of the Native Products Section actively used their brains, more than 5,000 dozen were sold, which is equal to 164% of the total export volume in 1951. The Montan wax stored by the Industrial Equipment Company had no sales channels. In this movement, someone invented a method of combining it with Soviet asphalt to replace the white wax used for skin line processing. The effectiveness is 20% higher than white wax. The original plan was to sell 0.3 tons of this cargo, but the actual sales were 12.5 tons.

    Since August, the circulating red flag labor competition movement in the trade departments of the entire East China region has also been widely and enthusiastically launched. 100,000 employees in the trade departments have all been involved in this huge upsurge. We believe that under the correct leadership and strong support of the Communist Party committees and the People's Governments in various places, the potential great power of all the employees in the trade system will surely be fully developed.

    促进城乡物资交流，持久地展开爱国主义劳动竞赛
    曾山
    （在华东贸易部循环红旗劳动竞赛授奖大会上的讲话摘要）
    “三反”以来，华东贸易部各部门在恢复业务，促进城乡物资交流上是有很大成就的。“三反”“五反”的伟大运动基本上已经胜利地结束了，危害国家经济建设的“三害”和“五毒”，基本上已被肃清，工人和农民的劳动热情和思想认识也大大地提高了，工业增产和农业丰产运动也有了显著的成绩。因此，如何进一步地深入开展城乡物资交流，争取全区市场更加普遍地健康地繁荣起来，为增产节约运动和国家大规模的建设创造有利条件，也就成为我们当前的迫切的中心任务之一。因为，只有扩大了城乡物资交流，活跃了市场，才能使农民在爱国丰产运动中的产品找到销路，提高农民的购买力，提高农民扩大再生产的热情，并且使工业增产所需原料，及工业产品的销售市场获得有力保证，从而促进工农业生产的正常发展，使整个国民经济能迅速地提高和繁荣，而加强贸易部门的工作是完成这一重大的中心任务的主要关键之一。
    斯大林同志对于苏维埃商业，通过城乡交流来刺激农业生产发展所起的作用，曾经这样明确地指出：“为要使全国经济生活十分活跃起来，而工业与农业又有不断扩大生产的刺激，那就还要有一个条件，这个条件就是城市与乡村间，区与区间，省与省间，国民经济各部门间的扩展的商品流转。”（斯大林：“在十七次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”。）
    列宁对贸易工作在新经济政策初期的重要意义，也曾这样肯定地给予很高的评价：“商业便是在历史事件练条中，……我们居领导地位的共产党，‘必须用全力抓住的环节’，……否则，我们既抓不住整个练条，社会主义的社会经济关系也无从建立了。”
    列宁和斯大林所指示的这一真理，现在从我们新民主主义经济的具体实践中，也充分证明了它的正确性和重要性。
    华东局和华东军政委员会，最近决定以“大力开展城乡物资交流，活跃市场”，为今年下半年华东全党和各级人民政府的中心任务之一，并号召各级领导干部，加强对商业工作的领导，切实改变过去在某些干部中只重视工农业生产而忽视商业的倾向。这个决定在今天是完全正确而必要的，是胜利贯彻城乡物资交流的一个根本保证。我们党和人民政府今天所以对贸易工作如此重视，将贸易工作放在这样重要的地位，主要的就是因为贸易工作在今天对于发展整个国民经济有着它特殊重大意义。所以贸易部门工作同志们，对于自己的工作，应该有更深刻的体会和明确的认识，对你们每一个人所肩负的光荣任务，应当提起高度的责任心，协同其他部门共同努力，完成扩大城乡物资交流，活跃市场的中心任务。不可否认，华东贸易部门工作同志，经过“三反”“五反”运动，一般说在思想上认识上都有提高，明确划清了思想界线，批判了资本主义经营思想，这些进步和提高，从最近一个时期，各国营贸易单位，在执行政策，完成任务等方面都已表现出来，这是很好的。但是，无可否认的，目前还存在着“宁左毋右”、“都包下来”的思想；而资本主义经营思想还相当严重。只讲任务，不重政策；只顾本位利益，不顾大体利益的现象还没有完全克服；经营上供给制思想，不关心人民财产，造成损失浪费的情况还相当普遍；某些地方并发展着形式铺张与强迫命令的现象。华东各级贸易工作同志，必须努力纠正这些错误思想，克服现存的各种不良现象，以求在现有基础上继续前进和提高，并胜利地完成国家所交给我们的光荣任务。
    为了发挥广大职工群众的劳动热情和生产上的创造性与积极性，为了使国家的贸易政策能深入地为每一个基层工作干部所掌握并贯彻到工作中去，为了保证工作任务能够正确地超额地完成，华东贸易部在群众自觉的基础上，开展了爱国主义循环红旗劳动竞赛，这是正确的良好的方法，通过这次各专业公司红旗劳动竞赛运动，我们就可以深切地感触到这个运动的巨大力量。根据各单位运动展开的情况来看，成绩表现得最普遍而显著的就是：
    一、通过竞赛运动，大多数的单位，在正确执行人民政府政策的原则下，完成或超额完成了工作任务；原来比较落后的单位，也都有了显著进步，很少发生偏差；就是在初期发生偏差的，在这次运动中都已及时加以检查纠正。例如：华东粮食公司收购小麦工作，在全国范围内是完成得最好的一个地区。在收购麦子初期，由于检查不及时，深入不够，各地对收购小麦精神体会不足，在地区差价和收购方式上曾经产生了一些缺点，这些偏差在七月份都已普遍检查纠正；中国工业器材公司华东区公司能够正确掌握出售方针和价格政策，都是好的例子。
    二、通过竞赛运动，各单位工作同志在政治觉悟和思想认识上都有显著的提高，树立了工人阶级的劳动观点和劳动态度，充分发挥出工作上的积极性和创造性，工作效率普遍提高。特别是在运动中涌现出大批优秀的模范干部和先进工作者，他们的模范事迹不但使国家减少了物资损失，节省了巨额费用，给国家积累了更多的财富；而且还以他们的先进经验和模范行为带动了其他工作同志积极前进。各单位提出的合理化建议，据初步统计已达三千多件。其中比较突出的，如：石油公司吕崇朴吸取苏联先进经验，学会高速电焊法，提高了工作效率两倍至三倍，并且初步扭转了技术人员崇拜英美的错误思想。华东区工业器材公司上海交通电器分公司工作同志学习苏联经验，采用先进装车法，从每辆平板车（三十吨）装汽车一辆，改进为三节平车装八辆，并且创造了特种跳板代替起重机。粮食公司黄贻训提出内部往来账务简化手续，节省了三、四十人的人力。又如七月份台风击袭上海时，许多公司的办公室和仓库工作同志都自动通宵值夜，做好一切防备工作，保护人民财产不受损失。百货公司运输部门同志，在狂风暴雨中分赴各码头车站防护物资，坚持了两天两夜，使所有物资没有受到任何损失。这些合理化建议，都是工人阶级的智慧和创造；这些优秀的先进工作者，都是我们国家和人民贸易部门最宝贵的人才。我们相信，在今后继续开展的竞赛运动中，将会有更光辉更重要的创造。
    三、通过竞赛运动，扭转了各单位的单纯营利观点的资本主义经营思想，在经营方式上以及业务工作组织制度上，都有了具体的改进，依靠群众智慧，创造了许多推销方法，使积压多年的冷背货，都获得适当利用，解决了销路问题。例如：土产公司出口草帽积压了两年多销不掉，在这次运动中，经过刘文龙及土产科全体同志积极开动脑筋，推销了五千多打，等于一九五一年全年出口数的百分之一百六十四。工业器材公司所存蒙旦蜡，一直没有销路，在这次运动中，有人发明了与苏联货沥青并合，代替皮线加工用的白蜡的办法，效能较白蜡尚高百分之二十，这种货物原计划销售○·三吨，结果实销十二点五吨。
    从八月份起，华东全区贸易部门的循环红旗劳动竞赛运动也已广泛地、热烈地发动起来了，贸易部门十万职工都已投入了这个巨大的热潮。我们相信：在各地中共党委和人民政府正确领导与大力支持下，所有的贸易系统职工潜在的巨大力量，一定将会充分地发扬出来。
