Draft of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of the Soviet Union

Amendments to the Party Constitution (Item 4 on the agenda of the Congress)

Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

Chapter 1. The Party, Party Members, and the Obligations and Rights of Party Members

Article 1. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a voluntary and militant alliance composed of like-minded communists from the working class, working peasants, and working intellectuals.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union organized the alliance of the working class and the working peasants, overthrew the rule of capitalists and landlords through the October Revolution of 1917, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, eliminated capitalism, eradicated the exploitation of man by man, and guaranteed the establishment of a socialist society.

Currently, the main task of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is to establish a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism, to gradually raise the material and cultural standards of society, to educate members of society in the spirit of internationalism and fraternal ties with the working people of all countries, and to extremely strengthen the active defense of the socialist motherland against the aggressive actions of its enemies.

Article 2. Any worker or citizen of the Soviet Union who does not exploit the labor of others, recognizes the Party Program and Constitution, actively promotes its realization, works in a Party organization, and executes all Party resolutions may become a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Party members must pay a certain amount of Party dues.

Article 3. Party members have the following obligations:

(1) To do everything possible to safeguard the unity of the Party, which is the primary and necessary condition for the Party's strength and power;

(2) To actively struggle to implement the Party's resolutions. It is not enough for a Party member to merely agree with the Party's resolutions; a Party member has the obligation to fight for the realization of these resolutions. A communist who adopts a passive and perfunctory attitude toward the Party's resolutions inevitably weakens the Party's combat effectiveness; therefore, this is incompatible with the status of a Party member;

(3) To play an exemplary role in labor, to master professional skills, and to constantly improve production and professional skills;

(4) To strengthen ties with the masses every day, to promptly reflect the demands and needs of the working people, to explain the Party's policies and resolutions to non-Party masses, and to always remember that the Party's strength and invincibility lie in its inseparable flesh-and-blood ties with the people;

(5) To strive to raise one's class consciousness and to master the principles of Marxism-Leninism;

(6) To abide by Party and state discipline, without exception for any Party member. There cannot be two kinds of discipline within the Party—one discipline for leaders and another for ordinary Party members. The Party has only one discipline, one law, which all communists must abide by, regardless of their merits or positions. Violating Party and state discipline is a serious crime that harms the Party; therefore, it is incompatible with the status of a Party member;

(7) To engage in self-criticism and criticism from below, to expose shortcomings in work and strive to eliminate them, to oppose superficial achievements, and to oppose being blinded by achievements in work. Suppressing criticism is a serious evil. Anyone who stifles criticism, is arrogant, and likes flattery cannot remain in the Party ranks;

(8) To report shortcomings in work to the Party's leading organs, up to the Party's Central Committee, regardless of who is involved. Party members have no right to conceal unsatisfactory situations or to ignore incorrect actions that damage the interests of the Party and the government. Anyone who hinders a Party member from fulfilling this obligation should be severely punished as someone who violates the will of the Party;

(9) To be loyal and honest to the Party, and not to conceal or distort the truth. It is a very serious evil for a communist to be disloyal to the Party and to deceive the Party, and it is incompatible with the status of a Party member;

(10) To keep Party and state secrets, to maintain political vigilance, and to always remember that a communist must be vigilant at all times and under all circumstances. Disclosing Party and state secrets is a crime against the Party, and is therefore incompatible with the status of a Party member;

(11) In any position entrusted by the Party, to resolutely implement the Party's instructions on correctly selecting cadres based on political qualities and professional abilities. Any act of violating these instructions and selecting personnel based on friendships, personal favors, or relationships of kinship and common origin is incompatible with the status of a Party member.

Article 4. Party members have the following rights:

(1) To participate in free and earnest discussions of Party policy issues at Party meetings or in Party publications;

(2) To criticize any Party worker at Party meetings;

(3) To elect and be elected to Party organs;

(4) To demand personal participation when decisions regarding their activities or behavior are being made;

(5) To raise any questions and make statements to any level of Party organs, up to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Article 5. The admission of Party members shall only be carried out according to individual procedures. New Party members are received from probationary members who have undergone the prescribed probationary period. Politically conscious, active, and loyal workers, peasants, and intellectuals devoted to the cause of communism may be admitted as Party members.

Persons applying for Party membership must be at least eighteen years old.

The procedures for admitting probationary members as full members are as follows:

(1) Applicants for Party membership must have three sponsors who have been Party members for at least three years and have known them for at least one year of working together.

[Note 1] When accepting applications for Party membership from members of the Communist Youth League, the recommendation of the Communist Youth League District Committee is equal to the recommendation of one Party member.

[Note 2] Members and alternate members of the CPSU Central Committee may not be sponsors.

(2) The issue of applying for Party membership shall be discussed and decided by the general meeting of the Party's grassroots organization, and its decision shall take effect upon approval by the Party's district committee or, in cities without districts, by the city committee. Sponsors are not required to be present when discussing the issue of applying for Party membership.

(3) Youths aged twenty and under can only join the Party through the Communist Youth League.

(4) Persons who have left other political parties to join the Party must have five Party member sponsors: three Party members with ten years of Party membership, and two Party members who joined the Party before the revolution, and must be processed through the Party's grassroots organization, and must be approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Article 6. Sponsors are responsible for the qualities of the persons they introduce.

Article 7. When a probationary member is converted into a full member, their Party membership is calculated from the date of the general meeting of the relevant Party grassroots organization that passed the resolution admitting the comrade as a full member.

Article 8. When a member of a Party organization transfers to the area of another organization, they become a member of the latter.

[Note] The transfer of Party members from one organization to another shall be carried out in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Article 9. A Party member or probationary member who fails to pay Party dues for three consecutive months without sufficient reason shall be deemed to have automatically withdrawn from the Party; the Party's grassroots organization may make a decision on this and submit it to the Party's district committee or city committee for approval.

Article 10. The issue of expelling a communist from the Party shall be decided by the general meeting of the Party's grassroots organization to which the member belongs, and shall be approved by the Party's district committee or city committee. The decision of the district committee or city committee to expel a member from the Party shall only take effect upon approval by the Party's state committee, border region committee, or the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Union Republic.

Article 11. If a communist is a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Union Republic, the Party's border region committee member, state committee member, special district committee member, city committee member, or district committee member, the Party's grassroots organization cannot make a decision to expel them from the Party.

The issue of removing a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Union Republic, the Party's border region committee member, state committee member, special district committee member, city committee member, or district committee member from their committee position or expelling them from the Party shall be decided by a plenary session of the respective committee if two-thirds of the plenary session votes that this is necessary.

Article 12. The issue of removing a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from their Central Committee position or expelling them from the Party shall be decided by the Party Congress, or, between congresses, by a plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with a two-thirds majority of the Central Committee plenary session. After the removal of a Central Committee member, the vacancy shall be filled by the alternate Central Committee members according to the procedure prescribed by the Congress when electing alternate Central Committee members.

Article 13. When a Party member commits an act that should be subject to legal punishment, they shall be expelled from the Party and the administrative and judicial authorities shall be notified.

Article 14. When deciding on the issue of expelling a Party member from the Party, the utmost caution and comradely concern should be maintained, and the basis for the charges against the Party member should be thoroughly studied.

For minor mistakes, the methods of Party education and persuasion (such as advice, warnings, etc.) should be adopted, rather than expulsion from the Party, because expulsion from the Party is the highest method of punishment by the Party.

When necessary, Party organizations may transfer a Party member to probationary membership for a period of up to one year as a method of Party punishment.

Article 15. Appeals from those expelled from the Party and resolutions of Party organizations regarding expulsion from the Party shall be reviewed by the Party organ receiving the appeal no later than twenty days after receiving the appeal.

Chapter 2. Probationary Members

Article 16. All those who voluntarily apply to join the Party must undergo the necessary probationary period in order to familiarize themselves with the Party Program, the Party Constitution, and the Party's tactics, and to allow the Party organization to examine the personal qualities of the probationary members.

Article 17. The procedures for receiving probationary members (individual reception, submission of recommendation letters and review of recommendation letters, the decision of the grassroots organization on accepting Party membership, and the approval of this decision) are exactly the same as for receiving Party members.

Article 18. The probationary period is set at one year. Party organizations must help probationary members prepare to join the Party. At the end of the probationary period, the Party organization should handle the issue of probationary members at the Party meeting. If a probationary member has not reached the level of Party membership for some reason, and the Party organization considers these reasons to be valid, the Party grassroots organization may extend their probationary period, but not for more than one year. If, during the probationary period, it is discovered that a probationary member is not suitable for Party membership due to their personal qualities, the Party organization may decide to revoke their probationary membership.

Article 19. Probationary members participate in the meetings of the organization to which they belong and have the right to speak, but no right to vote.

Article 20. Probationary members pay ordinary Party dues to the local Party committee.

Chapter 3. The Organizational Structure of the Party. Intra-Party Democracy

Article 21. The guiding principle of the Party's organizational structure is democratic centralism, which means:

(1) All leading organs of the Party, from the highest to the lowest, are elected;

(2) Party organs report on their work to their Party organizations regularly;

(3) Strict observance of Party discipline and subordination of the minority to the majority;

(4) Subordinate organs must absolutely obey the resolutions of superior organs.

Article 22. The Party is established according to the principles of region and production: a Party organization working in a certain region is a superior organization to all Party organizations working in parts of that region; a Party organization working in an entire work department is a superior organization to Party organizations working in parts of that work department's institutions.

Article 23. All Party organizations have the right to independently decide on local issues, but these decisions must not conflict with the Party's decisions.

Article 24. The highest leading organ of each Party organization is the general meeting of all Party members (for grassroots organizations), the representative conference (for example, for district or state organizations), or the congress (for the Communist Parties of the Union Republics and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union).

Article 25. The general meeting of all Party members, the representative conference, or the congress elects a standing committee or committee, which is its executive organ and leads all the daily work of the organization.

Article 26. When electing Party organs, it is forbidden to vote on the entire list of candidates. Voting should be done on individual candidates, ensuring that each Party member has the unrestricted right to oppose nominated candidates and criticize them. Elections shall be conducted by secret ballot.

Article 27. In urban and district centers, meetings of activists of the Party's urban and district organizations should be convened to discuss important resolutions of the Party and the government. The convening of activist meetings should not be for show, to formally and ceremonially endorse these resolutions, but to genuinely discuss them.

Article 28. Free and earnest discussion of Party policy issues within individual organizations or within the entire Party is an inalienable right of every Party member under the system of intra-Party democracy. Only on the basis of intra-Party democracy can Bolshevik self-criticism be launched and Party discipline be consolidated; Party discipline should be conscious, not mechanical.

However, broad discussions on Party policy issues, especially nationwide discussions, should be properly organized to prevent attempts by a very small number of people to force the Party majority to submit to their will, or attempts to form small organizations that undermine Party unity, or divisive attempts that may shake the strength and consolidation of the socialist system.

Therefore, a broad nationwide discussion can only be considered necessary under the following circumstances:

(1) Such necessity must be recognized by at least several local Party organizations belonging to the state or republic level;

(2) The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union does not have a sufficiently strong majority on the most important issues of Party policy;

(3) Although there is a strong majority in the Central Committee that advocates a certain viewpoint, the Central Committee considers it necessary to hold intra-Party discussions to check the correctness of its policy;

Only if these conditions are met can the Party be protected from anti-Party elements abusing intra-Party democracy; only under these conditions can intra-Party democracy be expected to benefit the cause, rather than be used to harm the Party and the working class.

Chapter 4. The Party's Highest Organs

Article 29. The highest organ of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the Party Congress. Regular congresses shall be convened at least once every four years. Extraordinary congresses shall be convened by the Party Central Committee on its own initiative or at the request of at least one-third of all Party members represented by the previous congress. The convening of a Party Congress and its agenda shall be announced no later than one and a half months before the congress. Extraordinary congresses shall be convened within two months.

A congress shall be deemed valid if the delegates attending the congress represent no fewer Party members than half of all Party members represented by the previous regular congress.

The proportion of delegates attending the congress shall be determined by the Central Committee.

Article 30. If the Party Central Committee fails to convene an extraordinary congress within the time limit stipulated in Article 29, the organizations requesting the convening of the extraordinary congress shall have the right to establish an organizing committee to exercise the functions of the Party Central Committee regarding the convening of the extraordinary congress.

Article 33. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union shall hold a plenary meeting at least once every six months. Alternate members of the Central Committee shall attend the plenary meetings of the Party Central Committee and have the right to speak, but no right to vote.

Article 34. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union establishes a Presidium and a Secretariat: the Presidium handles the work of the Central Committee between plenary meetings, and the Secretariat handles daily work, mainly organizing inspections of the implementation of Party resolutions and the selection of cadres.

Article 35. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union establishes the Party Control Committee of the Central Committee.

The Party Control Committee of the Central Committee of the Party:

(1) Inspects the observance of Party discipline by Party members and alternate members, punishes Party members and alternate members who violate the Party Program and Constitution and the discipline of the Party and the state, and Party members and alternate members who violate Party morality (deceiving the Party, disloyalty and dishonesty to the Party, slander, bureaucracy, dissolute personal life, etc.);

(2) Reviews appeals against the decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Union Republic, the Party's border region and state committees regarding expulsion from the Party and intra-Party punishment;

(3) Dispatches authorized representatives stationed in various republics, border regions, and states; these representatives are not subject to the jurisdiction of local Party organs.

Between congresses, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union leads all the Party's work, represents the Party in relations with other political parties, organizations, and organs, establishes various Party organs and guides their activities, appoints the editorial departments of various central Party newspapers working under its supervision and approves the appointment of the editorial departments of Party newspapers of large local organizations, organizes and manages enterprises with social significance, allocates the Party's human and financial resources, and manages the central fund.

The Central Committee guides the work of these organizations through Party groups in central Soviet organizations and public organizations.

Article 37. In order to strengthen leadership and political work, the Party Central Committee has the right to establish political departments in various sectors of socialist construction that are particularly important to the national economy and the entire country, and to appoint Party organizers of the Central Committee, and to abolish them or transform them into ordinary Party organs established according to the principles of production and region, depending on the extent to which the political departments complete their tasks.

The political departments work according to special instructions approved by the Central Committee.

Article 38. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regularly informs the Party organizations at all levels of its work.

### 苏联共产党关于党章的修正草案

1952-08-24
第3版()
专栏：

    苏联共产党关于党章的修正草案
    “真理报”二十日刊载苏联共产党（布尔什维克）关于党章的修正草案如下：
    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会的草案
    关于党章的修正案（代表大会议程第四项）
    苏联共产党党章
    第一章　党。党员和党员的义务与权利
    第一条　苏联共产党是工人阶级、劳动农民和劳动知识分子中思想一致的共产主义者所组成的自愿的战斗联盟。
    苏联共产党组织了工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，经过一九一七年的十月革命，推翻了资本家和地主的政权，建立了无产阶级专政，肃清了资本主义，消灭了人对人的剥削并保证了社会主义社会的建立。
    现在，苏联共产党的主要任务是：通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径来建立共产主义社会，逐步提高社会的物质和文化水平，用国际主义及与各国劳动人民建立兄弟联系的精神来教育社会成员，极度加强社会主义祖国对其敌人侵略行动的积极防御。
    第二条　苏联任何劳动者、任何公民，凡是不剥削他人的劳动、承认党纲党章、积极促其实现、在党的一个组织中工作并执行党的一切决议的，均得成为苏联共产党党员。
    党员必须缴纳一定数额的党费。
    第三条　党员有下列义务：
    （一）尽力护卫党的统一，这是党之所以有力量和强大的主要的必要条件；
    （二）为实现党的决议而积极斗争。对于党员来说，仅仅同意党的决议是不够的，党员有义务为实现这些决议而奋斗。共产党员对党的决议采取消极的阳奉阴违的态度，就必然会削弱党的战斗力，因此，这是和党员的身份不相容的；
    （三）在劳动中起模范作用，精通业务，不断提高生产和业务技能；
    （四）每日巩固与群众的联系，及时反映劳动人民的要求和需要，向非党群众解释党的政策和决议，时时记住我党之所以有力量和不可战胜就在于它和人民有着不可分割的血肉联系；
    （五）努力提高自己的阶级觉悟，精通马克思主义—列宁主义的原则；
    （六）遵守党和国家的纪律，一切党员均无例外。党内不能有两种纪律——不能对领导人有一种纪律，对普通党员又有一种纪律。党只有一个纪律，一个法律，一切共产党员不管他的功绩和职位如何，均应遵守。破坏党和国家的纪律，是损害党的严重罪恶，因此，是与党员的身份不相容的；
    （七）展开自我批评和自下面的批评，揭露工作中的缺点并努力加以消灭，反对表面成绩，反对因为工作中的成绩而冲昏头脑。压制批评是严重的恶行。凡是窒息批评、自高自大、喜欢奉承的人，都不能留在党的队伍里；
    （八）向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点，不管报告牵涉到什么人。党员无权隐瞒不能令人满意的情况和不过问损害党及政府的利益的不正确行动。凡是妨碍党员履行这项义务的人应作为违背党的意志的人而予以严惩；
    （九）对党忠诚老实，不隐瞒和歪曲事实真相。共产党员不忠实于党和欺骗党，是很严重的恶行，是与党员的身份不相容的；
    （十）保守党和国家的机密，保持政治警惕性，时时记得共产党员在任何时候，在任何情况下都必须保持警惕。泄露党和国家的机密，就是对党犯罪，因而是与党员的身份不相容的；
    （十一）在党所付托的任何岗位上，坚决执行党关于按照政治品质和业务能力正确选拔干部的指示。凡是破坏这种指示，按照朋友关系、私人情面、同乡和亲戚关系选拔工作人员的行为，都是与党员的身份不相容的。
    第四条　党员有下列权利：
    （一）在党的会议上或在党的报刊上参加党的政策问题的自由的、认真的讨论；
    （二）在党的会议上批评党的任何工作人员；
    （三）选举和被选举到党的机关；
    （四）凡在通过关于自己的活动或行为的决议时，要求亲自参加；
    （五）向党的任何一级机关直到苏联共产党中央委员会提出任何问题和声明。
    第五条　接收党员只能按照个别处理的手续进行。新党员是从经过了规定的候补期限的候补党员接收的。具有政治觉悟的、积极的、忠于共产主义事业的工人、农民和知识分子得接收为党员。
    入党的人须年满十八岁。
    接收候补党员为正式党员的手续如下：
    （一）申请入党者，要有三个至少有三年党龄并至少在一年共同工作中认识的党员的介绍。
    〔附注一〕接受共产主义青年团团员申请入
    党时，共产主义青年团区委员会
    的介绍等于一个党员的介绍。
    〔附注二〕苏联共产党中央委员和候补中央
    委员不得介绍。
    （二）申请入党问题由党的基层组织全体大会讨论和决定，其决定，经党的区委员会批准，在没有区的城市由市委员会批准，即发生效力。在讨论申请入党问题时，介绍人不一定出席。
    （三）二十岁和二十岁以下的青年入党只能经过共产主义青年团。
    （四）脱离其他政党的人入党要有五个党员介绍：三个有十年党龄的党员，两个革命以前入党的党员，并且非经过党的基层组织不可，同时必须苏联共产党中央委员会批准。
    第六条　介绍人要对他所介绍的人的品质负责。
    第七条　候补党员转为正式党员，其党龄从有关的党的基层组织全体大会通过该同志为正式党员的决议之日算起。
    第八条　一个党组织的党员转到另一组织的地区时，即为后者的党员。
    〔附注〕党员从一个组织转到另一个组织，
    须按照苏联共产党中央委员会规定
    的条例进行。
    第九条　党员和候补党员，没有充分理由连续三个月不缴纳党费，即立被认为自动脱党；党的基层组织对此可作出决定，交党的区委员会或市委员会批准。
    第十条　开除一个共产党员党籍的问题由该党员所属的党的基层组织全体大会决定，并由党的区委员会或市委员会批准。区委员会或市委员会关于开除党籍的决议，只有在党的州委员会、边疆区委员会或加盟共和国共产党中央委员会批准之下，才发生效力。
    第十一条　如果一个共产党员是苏联共产党中央委员、加盟共和国共产党中央委员、党的边疆区委员会委员、州委员会委员、专区委员会委员、市委员会委员、区委员会委员，党的基层组织不能作出开除他的党籍的决议。
    撤销加盟共和国共产党中央委员、党的边疆区委员会委员、州委员会委员、专区委员会委员、市委员会委员、区委员会委员的委员职务或开除其党籍的问题，由各该委员会的全体会议决定，如果全体会议三分之二的人投票决定这是必要的话。
    第十二条　解除苏联共产党中央委员的中委职务或开除其党籍的问题由党的代表大会，或在两次代表大会之间由苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议以中央委员会全体会议三分之二的多数决定。在撤销一个中央委员的职务后，遗缺由候补中央委员按照代表大会在选举候补中央委员时所规定的程序自行递补。
    第十三条　一个党员犯有应受法律处分的行为时，即予开除出党，并通知行政当局和司法当局。
    第十四条　在决定开除一个党员党籍的问题时，应保持最大的慎重和同志的关切，并透彻研究对该党员提出的罪状的根据。
    对于小的过错，应当采用党的教育和感化的方法
    （如劝告、警告等等），而不要开除党籍，因为开除党籍是党的最高的处罚方法。
    在必要的情况下，党的组织可以把一个党员转为候补党员，为期可以多达一年，作为党的处罚方法。
    第十五条　被开除党籍者的申诉书以及党组织关于开除党籍的决议应当由接到申诉的党的机关审阅，至迟应在收到该申诉书后二十天内审阅。
    第二章　候补党员
    第十六条　凡志愿入党者，都须经过必要的候补期限，以便使候补党员熟悉党纲、党章、党的策略，并使党的组织得以考察候补党员个人的品质。
    第十七条　接收候补党员的手续（个别接收、呈缴介绍书及审查介绍书、基层组织关于接收入党的决定以及这个决定的批准）同接收党员是完全一样的。
    第十八条　候补期限规定为一年。党组织必须帮助候补党员准备入党。在候补期限届满时，党组织应在党的会议上处理候补党员的问题。如果候补党员由于某些原因没有达到入党水平，而这些原因为党组织认为可以成立，则党的基层组织可以延长他的候补期限，但不得超过一年。如果在候补期间发现候补党员由于个人的品质不宜接收入党，党组织可决定取消他的候补党员资格。
    第十九条　候补党员参加他所属的组织的会议，有发言权，但无表决权。
    第二十条　候补党员向当地党委员会缴纳普通党费。
    第三章　党的组织结构。党内民主
    第二十一条　党的组织结构的指导原则是民主集中制，这就是说：
    （一）党的一切领导机关，由最高的到最低的，都是选举出来的；
    （二）党的机关向自己党的组织作定期的工作报告；
    （三）严格遵守党的纪律和少数服从多数；
    （四）下级机关绝对服从上级机关的决议。
    第二十二条　党是按照地区和生产的原则建立起来的：在某地区工作的党组织，对于在该地区的部分地区工作的一切党组织，是上级组织；在整个工作部门中工作的党组织，对于在该工作部门的一部分机构中工作的党组织，是上级组织。
    第二十三条　一切党组织对于地方性的问题有自主决定的权利，但这些决定不得与党的决定相抵触。
    第二十四条　每个党组织的最高领导机关是全体党员大会（对于基层组织）、代表会议（例如，对于区的组织、州的组织）或者代表大会（对于加盟共和国共产党和苏联共产党）。
    第二十五条　全体党员大会、代表会议或代表大会选举常务委员会或委员会，这是它们的执行机关，并领导该组织的一切日常工作。
    第二十六条　在选举党的机关时，禁止按整个候选名单投票。应当按个别候选人投票，保证每一个党员有无限制的权利反对被提名的候选人和批评他们。应用秘密投票的方法进行选举。
    第二十七条　在城市和区的中心，应召开党的城市和区组织的活动分子会议，讨论党和政府的重要决议。活动分子会议的召开不应是为了做做样子，在形式上和仪式上赞同这些决议，而是为了真正讨论这些决议。
    第二十八条　在个别组织内或在全党内自由而认真地讨论党的政策问题，是每个党员根据党内民主制所应有的不可剥夺的权利。只有在党内民主制的基础上才能够展开布尔什维克的自我批评和巩固党的纪律，党的纪律应当是自觉的，而不是机械的。
    但是关于党的政策问题的广泛讨论，特别是全苏联范围的讨论，应当加以适当组织，以防止极少数人强迫党内大多数人服从他们意志的企图，或是成立破坏党内统一的小组织的企图，或是制造可能动摇社会主义制度的力量和巩固性的分裂企图。
    因此，全苏联范围的广泛讨论，只能在下列情形下才能认为是必要的：
    （一）这种必要至少须为几个属于州或共和国一级的地方党组织所承认；
    （二）苏联共产党中央委员会对党的政策的最重要问题没有足够有力的大多数；
    （三）中央委员会内虽有主张一定观点的有力的大多数，但是中央委员会认为有必要举行党内讨论来检查自己政策的正确性；
    只有符合这些条件，才能护卫党而不让反党分子滥用党内民主；只有在这些条件下，才能指望党内民主有利于事业，而不会被利用来损害党和工人阶级。第四章　党的高级机关
    第二十九条　苏联共产党的最高机关是党代表大会。代表大会例会至少每四年召集一次。非常代表大会，由党中央委员会自己发起，或根据上次代表大会所代表的全体党员至少三分之一的要求，由党中央委员会召集之。党代表大会的召集及其议程，至迟应在代表大会前一个半月宣布。非常代表大会应在两个月内召集。
    出席代表大会的代表所代表的党员不少于上次定期代表大会所代表的全体党员的半数，该代表大会即视为有效。
    出席代表大会的代表比例，由中央委员会规定。

    中央委员会经过中央苏维埃组织和公共组织中的党组来指导这些组织的工作。
    第三十七条　为加强领导和加强政治工作起见，党中央委员会有权在各个对国民经济和整个国家有特别重要意义的社会主义建设部门设立政治部和委派中央委员会的党组织员，并按照政治部完成任务的程度，予以撤销，或改为按照生产和地区原则建立的普通的党机关。
    政治部根据中央委员会批准的特别指示进行工作。
    第三十八条　苏联共产党中央委员会定期把自己的工作通告党的各级组织。
