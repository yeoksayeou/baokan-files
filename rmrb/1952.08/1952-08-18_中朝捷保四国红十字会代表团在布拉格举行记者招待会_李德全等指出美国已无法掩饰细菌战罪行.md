Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th - The Red Cross delegations of Czechoslovakia, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Bulgaria, participating in the 18th International Red Cross Conference, held a press conference here on the 15th, hosted by the Czechoslovak Ministry of Information.

After the Czechoslovak representatives Novy and Beraha reported on the conference and the Red Cross Society Board of Governors meeting, Li Dequan, head of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, reported on the work done by the Chinese delegation at the Toronto conference.

Li Dequan believes that the adoption by the conference of the Polish proposal on the prohibition of bacteriological and chemical weapons and the proposal on famine relief are achievements of the conference because these proposals are conducive to safeguarding world peace and promoting humanitarian endeavors. However, she expressed regret that the conference did not adopt some important proposals, such as the proposal to immediately and unconditionally ban the use of atomic weapons, the proposal on the atrocities of the United States in violating the Geneva Conventions, and the proposal to revoke the privileges enjoyed by the American tool, the Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross. She said: The conference's failure to adopt these important proposals has seriously damaged its reputation in the eyes of people around the world.

Li Dequan also told reporters that the conference had made a serious mistake from the beginning by illegally allowing the Kuomintang remnants to participate in the conference, a decision that violated the charter and principles of the International Red Cross.

A Czechoslovak journalist asked about the public's reaction to the Chinese delegation's presentation of some evidence of the U.S. military's atrocities and germ warfare at a press conference in Toronto. Li Dequan replied that she regretted that the conference authorities had obstructed the display of evidence. The Chinese delegation did not even receive technical assistance such as a movie projector. For this reason, the documentary films about the U.S. military's germ warfare and the lenient treatment of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies could not be shown in Canada.

Li Dequan cited some examples at the press conference to illustrate that the United States' attempts to conceal its crimes of germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China were futile. She said: The Canadian bourgeois newspaper "The Globe and Mail" made the following conclusion on the front-page headline on the 9th regarding the 17-day conference: "Communists defeated in vote, but propaganda aims achieved." This is tantamount to admitting that the U.S. voting machine has failed to prevent the truth from being exposed to the world. After a press conference in Toronto, a staff member of the Canadian Red Cross said: "When I first heard about the germ warfare in Korea, I simply couldn't believe that people could do such a thing. But now my view has been shaken." Even American reporters reported in detail in their dispatches what they had seen. They saw "very interesting photostat exhibits and tape recordings of Innok and Quinn speaking." They had to admit: "These things explained the situation of bombing with germ bombs in extremely detailed and seemingly very convincing way..." ("New York Times")

Kim Min-san, head of the Korean delegation, also emphasized in his speech at the press conference the panic of the invading bloc and its futile attempts to conceal the atrocities of the U.S. military and the crimes of germ warfare. He also said: All efforts to prop up the discredited International Committee of the Red Cross have been shamefully defeated.

    中朝捷保四国红十字会代表团在布拉格举行记者招待会
    李德全等指出美国已无法掩饰细菌战罪行
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】参加第十八届国际红十字大会的捷克斯洛伐克、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和保加利亚红十字会代表团十五日在此间举行记者招待会，招待会由捷克斯洛伐克宣传部主持。
    在捷克斯洛伐克代表诺维和柏拉哈报告了大会和红十字会协会理事会会议情况以后，中国红十字会代表团团长李德全报告了中国代表团在多伦多大会中所做的工作。
    李德全认为大会通过波兰所提的关于禁止细菌武器与化学武器的提案和关于救济饥民的提案是大会的成就，因为这些提案有助于保障世界和平与促进人道的事业。但是，她对大会没有通过一些重要提案表示遗憾，这些提案是要求立即无条件禁止使用原子武器的提案以及关于美国破坏日内瓦公约的暴行的提案和关于取消美国工具瑞士红十字国际委员会享有的特权的提案。她说：由于大会没有通过这些重要提案，大会在全世界人民心目中的声望受到严重的打击。
    李德全还对记者说：大会从一开始就犯了严重错误，它非法允许国民党残匪参加大会，这种决定是违背国际红十字会的章程和原则的。
    一位捷克斯洛伐克记者问到公众对中国代表团在多伦多举行的记者招待会上提出美国军队的暴行和进行细菌战的部分罪证一举有什么反应。李德全回答说，她对大会当局阻挠展示罪证的行为感到遗憾。中国代表团甚至得不到像电影放映机那样的技术援助。由于这种缘故，关于美国军队进行细菌战和朝中人民军队宽待战俘的纪录影片未能在加拿大放映。
    李德全在记者招待会上列举一些事例，说明美国千方百计企图掩饰其在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的罪行是徒然的。她说：加拿大资产阶级大报“环球邮报”九日在头版标题中为历时十七日的大会作出这样的结论：“共产党人在表决时被击败，但是他们的宣传目的已经达到”。这等于承认美国表决的机器已无法阻止真相暴露于全世界面前。在多伦多举行的一次记者招待会结束以后，加拿大红十字会的一位工作人员说：“当我第一次听到在朝鲜进行细菌战的消息时，我简直不相信人怎会干这样的事。但是现在我的这种看法动摇了。”甚至连美国记者也在电讯中详细报道所见的情况。他们看到“极有兴趣的影印陈列品以及伊纳克和奎恩说话的录音”。他们不得不承认：“这些东西极其详尽而又似乎很有说服力地说明……投掷细菌弹的情形。”（“纽约时报”）
    朝鲜代表团团长金民山在记者招待会上的发言中，也强调指出侵略集团的惊惶万状以及白费心机地掩饰美国军队的暴行和进行细菌战的罪行的情形。他还说：替威信扫地的红十字国际委员会撑持门面的一切努力，已遭到可耻的失败。
