    Regarding the 1951 Financial Revenue and Expenditure Final Accounts and the 1952 Financial Revenue and Expenditure Budget of Beijing Municipality
    (Summary of the Report at the First Session of the Fourth Beijing Municipal People's Congress on August 11, 1952)
    Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of Beijing Municipality
    Now, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, I will report to the conference on the city's 1951 financial revenue and expenditure final accounts and the 1952 financial revenue and expenditure budget.
    First, I would like to report to the conference that, judging from the 1951 financial revenue and expenditure final accounts, we have made achievements in implementing the 1951 financial revenue and expenditure budget. In terms of revenue, it exceeded the original budget by 118.72 percent. If the income of municipal local enterprises is included, it exceeds 132 percent. This is mainly the result of the development of production and economic prosperity in the city under the condition of the improved national economic situation. According to the survey: in 1951, the total value of industrial production in the city increased by 156 percent compared with 1950, of which private industry increased by 134 percent; the business turnover increased by 126 percent compared with 1950, of which private commerce increased by 118 percent. As the total value of industrial production and business turnover increased, tax revenue naturally increased as well. Our various tax revenues exceeded the original planned figures approved by the central government by more than 100 percent. In terms of expenditure, it exceeded the original budget by 46.58 percent. If the income of municipal local enterprises converted into investment is included, it exceeds 59.31 percent. The main reason for exceeding the expenditure is that since the revenue has increased, we should spend more money according to the needs of the people and carry out the necessary construction of the capital. In the past, Beijing was under the rule of reactionary forces for a long time, with more destruction than construction. After liberation, we have continuously carried out construction work, but limited by financial resources, it is impossible to start everything from scratch. We should and can only carry out some necessary and possible construction with emphasis on priorities. We have been doing this for several years and have achieved results. Of course, this is only the beginning, like the Long March, we have just taken the first step. Originally, the 1951 budget was characterized by a larger proportion of operating expenses than administrative expenses (including subsidies to parties and groups). In the total budget, the former accounted for 59.48 percent and the latter accounted for 37.04 percent. Later, we added operating expenses to the budget or spent from the reserve fund to build new hospitals, primary schools, citizen's residences, worker dormitories, labor people's hotels, as well as the southern suburban slaughterhouse, the Dongsi People's Market, etc.; repaired roads, sewers, dredged the Jinyu Pond near the Longxugou River, and increased other necessary undertakings. In this way, the proportion of operating expenses became even larger. In the 1951 final accounts, operating expenses accounted for 69.39 percent of the total expenditure; administrative expenses (including subsidies to parties and groups) accounted for 29.38 percent. Although the expenditure increased, after offsetting the revenue and expenditure, not only was the deficit listed in the original budget eliminated, but also half of the central tax over-collection was turned over to the central government. In addition, there were some surpluses transferred to the 1952 budget.
    We have achieved results in implementing the 1951 budget, but there are also shortcomings. The main problem is that we did not strictly abide by the financial system and financial discipline. We did not strictly control and lead the basic construction projects, including municipal construction projects, so that some money that could have been saved was spent, and some money that could have been spent less was spent more. Even some departments, some units, and some cadres not only converted public funds into small public funds, set up ambushes, and reported false accounts, but also engaged in serious corruption and waste. These shortcomings have been exposed and corrected in the great "Three-Anti" Movement, and those who should be punished have been punished. On the other hand, we had shortcomings in preparing the budget. Because we underestimated the objective situation, mainly the speed of production development and economic prosperity based on the improvement of the national economic situation and the constantly developing enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, the target was set too low in terms of revenue. In the end, the actual revenue exceeded a lot, so in terms of expenditure, we constantly rushed to make plans and add to the budget, creating a passive phenomenon in work and finance. Coupled with the bureaucracy in leadership, it opened the door to corruption and waste.
    Secondly, I want to report to the conference that the 1952 financial revenue and expenditure budget is based on the 1951 financial revenue and expenditure final accounts, estimates the possible development of the economic situation after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and is compiled according to the central government's financial policy and the municipal government's work plan. Its basic spirit is to strive to increase possible and due revenue in accordance with the tax rates stipulated by the central government in order to ensure necessary expenditures. Among the so-called "necessary expenditures," the main ones are operating expenses. All expenses other than operating expenses should be economized as much as possible to squeeze out money for construction.
    In 1952, the original tax revenue plan approved by the central government increased by more than 125 percent compared with 1951, but only increased by 12.27 percent compared with the actual tax revenue in 1951. This task is possible to complete. Because first, as I said before, the target was set too low in terms of revenue in the 1951 budget, and it should be increased this year; second, the economic situation has greatly improved and developed in the past year, and it will definitely be further improved and developed this year.
    In all tax revenue, in addition to local taxes originally belonging to the city's revenue, 20 percent of the central tax can be retained as the city's revenue. In addition, there are monopoly income, deed tax income, various additional income, municipal local enterprise income, operating income, public property income, administrative income, as well as subsidies from higher levels (central government) and other income, which are the total revenue in our 1952 financial revenue and expenditure budget. It is 3.13 percent less than the total revenue listed in the 1951 financial revenue and expenditure final accounts, but more than 125 percent more than the total revenue listed in the budget.
    In the total expenditure, operating expenses account for 75.13 percent, and administrative expenses (including subsidies to parties and groups, etc.) account for 20.62 percent. How will this huge amount of operating expenses be allocated? First of all, it is used for social undertakings such as culture, education, health, and preferential treatment and relief, that is, in the total expenditure, health operating expenses account for 22.76 percent, culture and education operating expenses account for 22.39 percent (the funds for the construction of 5,000 primary and secondary school buildings recently approved by the central government have not been included), and social operating expenses account for 2.38 percent, totaling 47.53 percent. Before the liberation of the city, public health, especially environmental sanitation, was very poor. There were very few medical institutions, especially in areas where the working people lived. In the past three years, we have carried out a lot of construction work in this regard, increased medical institutions, and improved sanitary conditions, but it is still far from meeting objective needs. In order to cooperate with the patriotic health movement and protect the health of the majority of citizens, it is necessary to spend more money on health undertakings this year. Similarly, in the past three years, we have also carried out a lot of construction work in culture and education. This year, a large number of primary and secondary schools will be added, and at the same time, the literacy movement to eliminate illiteracy will be actively carried out. As for social undertakings such as preferential treatment and relief, both the absolute figures and the proportion in the total expenditure have increased compared with 1951. The second largest item in the operating expenses is municipal construction expenses, accounting for 21.04 percent of the total expenditure (including the funds for workers' dormitories built by various state-owned factories and enterprises themselves and the funds for the construction of 1,900 citizen's residences and 4,000 labor people's hotels recently approved by the central government are not included). The main purpose is to increase trams and buses, expand tap water pipelines, and repair public houses, so as to further solve the citizens' housing, drinking water, and transportation problems. Investment in municipal local enterprises accounts for 5.45 percent of the total expenditure, which is smaller than the proportion occupied by culture, education, health, and municipal construction. Does this mean that we do not attach importance to the development of production and violate our own proposed policy of "production first"? No. First, large enterprises and large factories within the city, such as steel plants, are directly invested by the central government, and the 50,000-spindle cotton mill planned to be established by the city is also allocated special funds by the central government, which are not included in this year's budget; second, we have taken over 342 units of organ production, worth more than 400 billion yuan, which have all been transferred to the city's enterprise investment and are not included in this year's budget. Also, some of the municipal construction operating expenses used for tap water, trams, and buses also have the nature of enterprise investment. Therefore, in fact, this year's enterprise investment is no less than the operating expenses for culture, education, health, or municipal construction. The fourth largest item in the operating expenses is agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy expenditure, accounting for 1.11 percent of the total expenditure. This proportion is very small. But it does not mean that we do not attach importance to agricultural production, but because larger-scale water conservancy projects and afforestation will be allocated special funds by the central government, and general support for production will be taken by means of loans or acquisitions by banks and cooperatives. In short, in the total expenditure of this year's budget, operating expenses account for more than three-quarters, exceeding the proportion of any year since liberation. If we add the special funds allocated by the central government for the above-mentioned suburban basic construction projects and the funds recently approved for the construction of school buildings, hotels, citizen's residences, etc., the operating expenses will increase from 75.13 percent to 82.66 percent, and the administrative expenses (including subsidies to parties and groups) will decrease from 20.62 percent to 14.48 percent.
    Finally, I want to report to the conference that the implementation of this year's budget in the first half of the year is good. In terms of revenue, 50.11 percent of the annual tax revenue plan has been completed, of which 51.52 percent of the central tax has been completed, and 31.83 percent of the local tax has been completed due to the late start of the real estate tax. Therefore, only 45.62 percent of the total revenue listed in this year's budget has been completed. In the future, we still need to work hard in terms of revenue. Tax officials must be conscientious and responsible, work actively, and not allow any tax evasion. But at the same time, no extra collection of even one cent is allowed. Everything must be done in accordance with the law. It is estimated that the plan can be completed, because after the "Five-Anti" movement, the economy is more prosperous, and tax revenue may increase compared with the first half of the year. In terms of expenditure, because the municipal construction project started late, and the operating expenses for culture, education, and health are more spent in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, only 34.73 percent of the original budget has been spent. But if temporary payments and basic construction material payments are added, it is 60.19 percent. The expenditure in the second half of the year is originally more than in the first half of the year, and now some units have put forward requests for additional budgets. If we do not seize the opportunity, there will be a danger of breaking through the budget and spending more than we earn. This should be vigilant.

    关于北京市一九五一年度财政收支决算和一九五二年度财政收支预算
    （一九五二年八月十一日在北京市第四届第一次各界人民代表会议上的报告摘要）
    北京市人民政府副市长　张友渔
    现在，我代表北京市人民政府向大会报告本市一九五一年度财政收支决算和一九五二年度财政收支预算。
    首先，我要向大会报告的是：从一九五一年度财政收支决算来看，我们执行一九五一年度财政收支预算是有成绩的。在收入方面，超过原预算百分之一百一十八点七二，如加上市属地方企业收入，则超过百分之一百三十二强。这主要是在全国经济情况好转的条件下，本市生产发展、经济繁荣的结果。据调查：一九五一年度本市工业生产总值比一九五零年度增加百分之一百五十六，其中，私营工业增加百分之一百三十四；商业营业额比一九五零年度增加百分之一百二十六，其中，私营商业增加百分之一百一十八。工业生产总值和商业营业额既增加，税收当然也就随着增加了。我们的各项税收超过中央核定的原订计划数的百分之一百强。在支出方面，则超过原预算百分之四十六点五八，如加上市属地方企业收入转为投资部分则超过百分之五十九点三一。支出超过的主要原因，是由于收入既然增加了，就应该根据人民的需要，多花一些钱，进行首都的必要建设。北京过去，长期处在反动势力统治之下，破坏多，建设少。解放后，我们曾经不断地进行了建设工作，但限于财力，不可能百废俱举，应该也只能分别轻重缓急，有重点地进行一些必要与可能的建设。我们几年来，一直是这样做的，并已获得了成绩。当然这还只是开端，好像万里长征，刚迈出了第一步。本来，一九五一年度的预算就是事业费的比重大于行政费（包括党派团体补助费），在预算总额中，前者占百分之五十九点四八，后者占百分之三十七点零四。后来，我们又追加事业费预算，或从预备费项下开支，新建医院、小学、市民住宅、工人宿舍、劳动人民旅馆以及南郊屠宰场，东四人民市场等；增修道路、下水道，疏浚龙须沟附近的金鱼池，和增办其他必要的事业。这样，事业费的比重就更大了。在一九五一年度的决算中，事业费占支出总额的百分之六十九点三九；行政费（包括党派团体补助费）占百分之二十九点三八。支出虽然增加了，但收支相抵，不仅消灭了原预算中所列的赤字，而且把中央税超收留成的半数上解中央。此外，还有一些结余转入了一九五二年度预算。
    我们执行一九五一年度预算是有成绩的，但也有缺点。主要是遵守财政制度和财政纪律还不够严格，对基本建设工程包括市政建设工程，没有严格地掌握与领导，以致有些可以不花的钱花了，可以少花的钱多花了，甚至有些部门，有些单位，有些干部不仅化大公为小公，打埋伏，报虚账，而且还有过严重的贪污浪费行为。这些缺点，在伟大的“三反”运动中，已被揭发，被纠正，当惩办的，已予惩办。另一方面，我们在编制预算上，是有缺点的。由于我们对客观情况，主要是对建筑在全国经济情况好转和不断发扬的群众的积极性和创造性基础之上的生产发展和经济繁荣的速度估计不足，在收入方面，提得目标过低，最后，实际收入超过很多，因而在支出方面，也就不断地，赶造计划，追加预算，造成工作和财政上的被动现象，加以领导上的官僚主义，便给贪污浪费开了方便之门。
    其次，我要向大会报告的是：一九五二年度财政收支预算，是以一九五一年度财政收支决算为基础，估计了“三反”、“五反”后经济情况的可能发展，根据中央的财政方针和市人民政府的工作计划编成的。它的基本精神是按照中央所规定的税率，努力增加可能和应有的收入，以保证必要的支出。而在所谓“必要的支出”中，主要是事业费。事业费以外的一切开支，尽量撙节，挤出钱来进行建设。
    一九五二年度，中央核定的原订税收计划，较一九五一年度增加了百分之一百二十五强，但较一九五一年度的实际税收仅增加了百分之十二点二七。这个任务是可能完成的。因为第一、像前面所说过的，一九五一年度预算在收入方面，提得目标过低，本年度应该提高；第二、去年一年中，经济情况已有很大的改善和发展，今年将必有更进一步的改善和发展。
    在全部税收中，除地方税原属本市收入外，并可从中央税中留成百分之二十，作为本市收入。再加上专卖收入、契税收入、各项附加收入、市属地方企业收入、事业收入、公产收入、行政收入以及上级（中央）补助和其他收入等，即为我们一九五二年度财政收支预算中的收入总额。它较一九五一年度财政收支决算中所列收入总额减少百分之三点一三，但较预算中所列收入总额，则增加百分之一百二十五强。
    在支出总额中，事业费占百分之七十五点一三，行政费（包括党派团体补助费等）占百分之二十点六二。这笔巨额的事业费将怎样支配呢？首先是用在文教、卫生和优抚救济等社会事业方面，即在支出总额中，卫生事业费占百分之二十二点七六，文教事业费占百分之二十二点三九（最近中央核准建筑中小学校舍五千间的经费未及计入），社会事业费占百分之二点三八，合计共占百分之四十七点五三。本市解放前，公共卫生事业特别是环境卫生方面是很差的。医疗机构很少，尤其在劳动人民聚居的区域更少。三年来，我们在这方面曾进行了不少建设工作，增加了医疗机构，改进了卫生条件，但还远不能适应客观需要。为了配合爱国卫生运动，保护广大市民的健康，本年度在卫生事业方面，多花一些钱是必要的。同样，在文教事业方面，三年来，我们也进行了不少建设工作。本年度，中小学还要大量增校增班，同时积极进行扫除文盲的识字运动。至于优抚救济等社会事业费也是不论绝对数字和在开支总额中所占比例，都较一九五一年度有所增加。在事业费中占第二位的，是市政建设费，计占支出总额的百分之二十一点零四（其中，不包括各国营工厂、企业自建工人宿舍和中央最近核准建筑市民住宅一千九百间、劳动人民旅馆四千间的经费）。主要用途是增加电车和公共汽车，扩充自来水管线，修缮公有房屋，以进一步解决市民住房、吃水和交通问题。市属地方企业投资占支出总额的百分之五点四五，较文教、卫生、市政建设所占比例都小。这是不是说明我们不重视发展生产，违反我们自己所提出的“生产第一”的方针呢？不是。第一、在本市范围内的大企业，大工厂，如钢铁厂等，都是由中央直接投资，本市筹设的五万锭纱厂也是中央另拨专款，都没有列入本年度预算；第二、我们接管了机关生产三百四十二个单位，价值四千多亿元，都转作本市企业投资，也没有列入本年度预算。还有市政建设事业费中，用于自来水、电车和公共汽车的部分，也带有企业投资的性质。因此，实际上，本年度企业投资并不少于文教、卫生或市政建设事业费。在事业费中占第四位的，是农林、水利支出，共占支出总额的百分之一点一一。这个比例很小。但也不是表示我们不重视农业生产，而是因为较大规模的水利工程和造林，将由中央另拨专款，而一般扶植生产，则采取了由银行、合作社贷款或收购的办法。总之，在本年度预算的支出总额中，事业费占了四分之三以上，超过解放以来任何一年的比重。如果再把为了进行上述郊区基本建设工程等中央所拨的专款和最近核准建筑校舍、旅馆、市民住宅等经费计算在内，则事业费就更由百分之七十五点一三，增大到百分之八十二点六六，而行政费（包括党派团体补助费）则由百分之二十点六二，更降低到百分之十四点四八了。
    最后，我要向大会报告的是：上半年，执行本年度预算的情况是良好的。在收入方面，全年税收计划已完成百分之五十点一一，其中，中央税完成百分之五十一点五二，地方税因房地产税开征较晚，只完成了百分之三十一点八三。因此，本年度预算所列收入总额只完成百分之四十五点六二。今后，在收入方面，仍须我们努力。税收人员必须认真负责，积极工作，不使任何税收有所偷漏。但同时，也不许有一文额外征收。一切都须依法办理。估计计划一定可完成，因为“五反”运动后，经济更加繁荣，税收可能较上半年增加。在支出方面，因市政建设工程开始较晚，而文教卫生等事业费，下半年开支较上半年为多，故已花的钱，只占原预算百分之三十四点七三。但如把暂付款和基本建设备料款加入，则为百分之六十点一九。下半年的开支，比较上半年本来就要多，现在并已有些单位提出追加预算的要求，如不抓紧，就会有突破预算、入不敷出的危险。这是应该警惕的。
