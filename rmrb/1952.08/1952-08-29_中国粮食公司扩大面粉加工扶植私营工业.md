China Grain Corporation Expands Flour Processing to Support Private Industry

Since the spring of this year, the China Grain Corporation at all levels has been increasing the amount of flour processing nationwide month by month in order to support the production of private industry and invigorate the urban and rural economies. According to statistics, the amount processed in April increased by 11.49% compared to March, the amount in May increased by 11.2% compared to April, the amount in June increased by 11.3% compared to May, and the amount in July increased by 11.6% compared to June. With the strong support of the state-owned grain companies, flour production in various regions is gradually increasing. Recently, the China Grain Corporation, based on new changes in the market situation, convened a national flour processing work conference, further increasing the 1952 processing plan. It was decided that the national annual flour processing volume would account for approximately 44.34% of the total production capacity of flour mills nationwide, an increase of 232.15% compared to the actual processing volume in 1950, and an increase of 72.79% compared to the actual processing volume in 1951.

Over the past two years, with the strong support of the state-owned grain companies, the national flour industry has fundamentally reversed the unreasonable phenomena in production and sales that existed in the past. In Shanghai's flour factories, the operating rate in 1950 was around 10%. With strong state support, the amount of commissioned processing in the second half of 1951 reached 50% of the total production capacity of the city's flour mills. In the second half of 1952, the amount of commissioned processing increased to 70% of the total production capacity of the city's flour mills. Coupled with the self-operated business of manufacturers, the flour industry in Shanghai not only fully recovered production but also began to develop. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the "five evils" were eliminated, and workers' enthusiasm for production was greatly improved. They were able to gradually improve technically, increase production, and greatly reduce processing costs. For example, technical workers at the Tianjin Shoufeng Flour Mill created the "front-end flour extraction method," increasing the proportion of coarse grinding in the front of the flour machine, resulting in an average increase in output of 30% to 50%. In another example, due to the active improvements made by workers at the Xi'an Flour Mill, 3.4 jin of raw materials could be saved for each bag of flour processed. At the same time, production costs in other flour mills in various regions were generally reduced by about 10% to 20%. Currently, the specifications and brands of processed flour are being gradually unified nationwide, and flour industries are being urged to improve technology and quality.

    中国粮食公司扩大面粉加工扶植私营工业
    中国粮食公司各级公司为了扶植私营工业生产，活跃城乡经济，自今春以来，在全国范围内逐月增加了面粉加工的数字。据统计：四月份加工较三月份增加了百分之一一·四九，五月份较四月份又增加了百分之一一·二，六月份又较五月份增加了百分之一一·三，七月份又较六月份增加了百分之一一·六。各地面粉工业在国营粮食公司的大力扶植下，生产逐渐上升。最近中国粮食公司又根据市场变化的新情况，召开了一次全国面粉加工工作会议，重新增大了一九五二年的加工计划，决定全国全年面粉加工数量，约占全国粉厂总生产能力的百分之四四·三四，较一九五○年的加工实绩增加了百分之二三二·一五，较一九五一年的加工实绩则增加了百分之七二·七九。
    两年来，全国面粉工业在国营粮食公司的大力扶植下，已基本上扭转了过去产销中的不合理现象。上海的面粉工厂，一九五○年的开车率为百分之十左右，经国家大力扶植，一九五一年下半年委托加工数量即达全市粉厂生产能力的百分之五○，至一九五二年下半年则委托加工数量增大至全市粉厂生产能力的百分之七○，再加厂商自营，因而上海面粉工业不仅完全恢复了生产而且已开始走向发展。“三反”“五反”运动后，“五毒”清除，工人生产情绪大大提高，技术上更能逐步改进，生产提高，加工费用大为减低。例如天津寿丰粉厂技术工人创造了“前路出粉法”，将粉机前车糙磨比例加大，平均增加了产量百分之三○至五○；另如西安市粉厂由于工人的积极改进，加工面粉每袋可节省原料三斤四两；同时其他各地粉厂生产成本一般的也都降低了百分之十至二十左右。目前正在逐渐统一全国加工面粉的规格、牌号，并督促面粉工业改技进术，提高质量。　　（中国粮食公司通讯组）
