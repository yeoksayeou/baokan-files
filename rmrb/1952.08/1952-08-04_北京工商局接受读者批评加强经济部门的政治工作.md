Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce Accepts Readers' Criticism, Strengthens Political Work in Economic Departments
    Editor,
    The "Readers' Letters" column on July 12th published criticisms from Comrade Chen Wenxue of the Administration for Industry and Commerce and Comrade Zhang Zikai of the Beijing Trust Company regarding the "neglect of politics and emphasis on business" within the leadership of the Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce, and suggested that the Administration strengthen political work in economic departments. We believe this criticism and suggestion are correct. In the past, the Administration for Industry and Commerce indeed had a serious bias in its leadership thinking towards "emphasizing business and neglecting politics." When assigning tasks to cadres, it often only required the completion of the task, and did not pay enough attention to the political and ideological education of cadres, resulting in the political level of cadres in the Administration for Industry and Commerce system not keeping up with the development of the objective situation, and some cadres' ideological problems not being resolved in a timely manner. The great "Three-Anti" movement fully proved this point. All our mistakes and shortcomings have been exposed, and the corrupt behavior of many cadres has been discovered. The purely task-oriented viewpoint and capitalist business ideology that existed in business operations have aroused our attention. The leadership of the Administration for Industry and Commerce has made a review of this serious bias in the "Three-Anti" movement, and recognized that only by strengthening the political and ideological leadership of cadres can business work be done well; however, until now, the effort we have put in and the speed of improvement in this area are still far from sufficient. The criticisms and suggestions of Comrades Chen Wenxue and Zhang Zikai have sounded an alarm for us. From now on, we will:
    1.  Attach importance to the political work of economic departments in leadership thinking, establish a dedicated person to do political work, and add a deputy manager in each company to be responsible for political and ideological education.
    2.  Improve the personnel organizations at all levels, adjust personnel cadres, and strengthen personnel work.
    3.  Strengthen cadre study, improve the grassroots study committees of each company, the Administration for Industry and Commerce establishes a sub-study committee, and sets up a study committee office to lead the cadre study of each company.
    4.  Prepare cadre training courses to train in-service cadres in rotation to improve the political and ideological level and business level of cadres.
    Beijing Municipal People's Government Administration for Industry and Commerce

### 北京工商局接受读者批评加强经济部门的政治工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京工商局接受读者批评加强经济部门的政治工作
    编辑同志：七月十二日“读者来信”栏刊载了工商局陈文学同志和北京市信托公司张自凯同志对北京市工商局领导方面存在着“轻视政治、重视业务”的缺点的批评，并建议工商局加强经济部门的政治工作。我们认为这个批评和建议是正确的。过去工商局在领导思想上确实存在着“重业务、轻政治”的严重偏向，向干部分配工作时，常常只是要求完成任务，而对干部的政治思想教育工作却不够重视，致使工商局系统干部的政治水平赶不上客观形势的发展，有些干部的思想问题没有及时得到解决。伟大的“三反”运动充分证明了这一点。我们各方面的错误和缺点都暴露出来了，不少干部的贪污行为被发现了，在业务经营中存在着的单纯的任务观点和资本主义经营思想，更引起我们的注意。工商局领导方面对于这种严重偏向，已在“三反”运动中作了检讨，并认识到只有加强干部的政治思想领导，才能作好业务工作；但是，直到现在，我们在这方面用的力量和改进的速度还很不够。陈文学、张自凯等同志的批评、建议给我们敲了警钟。今后我们要：
    一、在领导思想上重视经济部门的政治工作，设立专人作政治工作，并在各公司添设副经理一人，负责政治思想教育工作。
    二、健全各级人事机构，调整人事干部，加强人事工作。
    三、加强干部学习，健全各公司基层学习委员会，工商局成立分学习委员会，并设学习委员会办公室，领导各公司的干部学习。
    四、筹办干部训练班，轮训在职干部，以提高干部的政治思想水平及业务水平。
    北京市人民政府工商局
