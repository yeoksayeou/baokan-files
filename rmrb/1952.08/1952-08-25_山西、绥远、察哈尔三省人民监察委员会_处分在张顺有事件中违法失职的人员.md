    [News from this newspaper] Following the exposure by the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of bureaucratic errors by relevant organs and personnel in Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Chahar provinces in the Zhang Shunyou denunciation of counter-revolutionaries incident, the People's Supervisory Committees of the three provinces investigated the relevant organs and personnel involved in the incident. Those personnel found to have violated laws or neglected their duties were given administrative punishments.
    Wei Fengqi, Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, demonstrated a seriously irresponsible and bureaucratic attitude towards the masses' accusations. When Zhang Shunyou came to the province for the second time, Wei knew that Zhang had been traveling for half a year to report counter-revolutionaries and was experiencing financial difficulties. However, he neither spoke directly with Zhang Shunyou nor actively helped him. Furthermore, when lower-level cadres reported that Zhang wanted to go to the Central Committee to see Chairman Mao, he said, "Let him go!" This attitude of not solving problems for the masses and pushing them away is a bureaucratic style that shows indifference to the suffering of the people. The Shanxi Provincial People's Supervisory Committee proposed, and the Government Administration Council approved, a warning punishment.
    Zhao Zhenfang, a probationary staff member of the Investigation Section of the Public Security Bureau of Guisui City, Suiyuan Province, displayed a bureaucratic style and violated human rights in this incident. When escorting the counter-revolutionary criminal Song Yude to Yanggao, he was not aware of the details of the case and suggested that the bailiff handcuff Zhang Shunyou. Zhao Zhenfang's error should have been severely punished. However, because he immediately chased after the train to remove the handcuffs and apologize after being criticized, showing he was willing to correct his mistakes, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Supervisory Committee, based on the principle of lenient treatment, gave him a demotion.
    Yu Weikun, the director of the Xiaoxijie Police Station of the Second Branch Bureau of the Guisui City Public Security Bureau, Suiyuan Province, consistently performed poorly in his work. When Zhang Shunyou went to the station to file a complaint and request a solution to his wage issues, Yu questioned him: "He is a landlord, do you have evidence? Claiming wages is a civil dispute, you can file a lawsuit in court!" He pushed the matter away and refused to deal with it, obstructing Zhang Shunyou's righteous actions. Yu Weikun had lost the proper stance of a people's cadre, and the Suiyuan Provincial People's Supervisory Committee decided to demote him.
    Cui Zhi, the Secretary Director, and Yu Li, the Deputy Section Chief, of the Guisui City Public Security Bureau of Suiyuan Province, had not paid attention to the Zhang Shunyou incident even after it was exposed in the People's Daily. They still adopted a bureaucratic attitude, pushing Zhang Shunyou's wage issue down the line level by level, without supervising or inspecting. This attitude of indifference to the masses is particularly serious, especially after the "Zhang Shunyou Incident." The Suiyuan Provincial People's Supervisory Committee instructed the Guisui City People's Government to seriously deal with it appropriately.
    Wang Tingshi, a member of the Execution Section of the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau in Chahar Province, displayed serious irresponsibility in this incident. After accepting Zhang Shunyou's complaint, he promised to write a letter to the Guisui Public Security Bureau, but afterwards, he neither handled it nor reported it to his superiors. This is a serious act of lacking organization and discipline. The Chahar Provincial People's Supervisory Committee decided to give him a demerit.
    Wu Xiang, a staff member of the detention center of the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau in Chahar Province, neglected his duties and violated human rights by detaining Zhang Shunyou and a counter-revolutionary together in the detention center without asking questions or checking the introduction letter. Wu Xiang has already been arrested for corruption, and the Chahar Provincial People's Supervisory Committee decided to increase his punishment.
    Li Hengwen, the Deputy Director of the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau in Chahar Province, was unaware of the fact that subordinate cadres refused to accept Zhang Shunyou's denunciation of a counter-revolutionary case and the error of wrongly detaining Zhang Shunyou before the fact, and he did not give appropriate handling or report it to his superiors afterward. This is a serious bureaucratic dereliction of duty, and the Chahar Provincial People's Supervisory Committee decided to give him a warning punishment.
    Zhang Xu, a staff member of the Interrogation Section of the Political Security Section of the Yanbei Prefectural Public Security Office in Chahar Province, used the excuse that Zhang Shunyou did not have an introduction letter to push Zhang Shunyou to other departments, causing Zhang Shunyou to make three fruitless trips. He neither checked the handling results himself nor reported to his superiors, demonstrating a serious lack of work responsibility and a lack of organization and discipline. The Chahar Provincial People's Supervisory Committee decided to give him a warning punishment.
    In the process of Zhang Shunyou's denunciation of counter-revolutionaries, the People's Government and the General Trade Union of Guoxian County, and the Second District People's Government of Shanxi Province, the Taipingjie Police Station of Guisui City, Suiyuan Province, and Song Zenghai, a cadre of Dongshuidi Village in the Fourth District of Yanggao County, Chahar Province, took a relatively serious and responsible attitude toward this issue and provided support and assistance to Zhang Shunyou. The above-mentioned organs and personnel have been commended.

    山西、绥远、察哈尔三省人民监察委员会
    处分在张顺有事件中违法失职的人员
    【本报讯】在张顺有检举反革命分子事件中山西、绥远、察哈尔三省有关机关和人员的官僚主义错误，经中共中央华北局揭发后，山西、绥远、察哈尔三省人民监察委员会对该事件中的有关机关和人员进行了检查，并对其中违法失职的人员分别给予行政处分。
    山西省人民政府秘书长卫逢祺，对群众控告表现了严重的不负责任的官僚主义态度。他在张顺有第二次来省时，已知道张为检举反革命分子奔波半年之久，生活陷于困难，但他既未和张顺有直接谈话，也未积极帮助，并且当下级干部报告张要到中央见毛主席时，还说：“由他去吧！”这种不给群众解决问题、推走了事的态度，实系对待人民疾苦漠不关心的官僚主义作风。经山西省人民监察委员会拟定，并由政务院批准给以警告处分。
    绥远省归绥市公安局侦讯科见习科员赵振芳，在此次事件中，表现了官僚主义作风和侵犯人权的行为。在解送反革命犯宋郁德赴阳高时，不悉案情，便暗示法警给张顺有带上手铐。赵振芳所犯错误本应严予惩处，惟其当时经批评后，立即追到车站解铐道歉，尚能勇于改过，绥远省人民监察委员会本从宽处理精神，给以撤职处分。
    绥远省归绥市公安二分局小西街派出所所长于维坤，工作一贯表现不好。当张顺有到该所控告并要求解决工资问题时，余竟质问：“他是地主，你是否有证据？要工资是民事纠纷，可到法院起诉！”把事情推出不管，使张顺有的正义行动遭到阻挠。余维坤已经丧失了人民干部应有的立场，绥远省人民监察委员会决定给以撤职处分。
    绥远省归绥市公安局秘书主任崔志、副科长于理，在张顺有事件已在人民日报揭发之后，该局已开过两次会议，还未引起他们的重视，仍以官僚主义的态度，对张顺有工资问题逐级下推，既不督促也不检查。这种对群众漠不关心的态度，特别发生在“张顺有事件”之后，是相当严重的。绥远省人民监察委员会责成归绥市人民政府认真予以适当处理。
    察哈尔省阳高县公安局执行股股员王廷仕，在此次事件中，表现了严重的不负责任。他接受了张顺有控告之后，曾答应给归绥公安局写信，但事后既未处理，也没有向领导上报告，这是严重的无组织无纪律的行为。察哈尔省人民监察委员会决定给以记过处分。
    察哈尔省阳高县公安局看守所干事武祥，玩忽职守，侵犯人权，不问青红皂白，不看介绍信就把张顺有和反革命分子一并押进监所。武祥已因贪污行为被逮捕，察哈尔省人民监察委员会决定加重其处分。
    察哈尔省阳高县公安局副局长李恒文，对所属干部拒绝受理张顺有检举反革命案件及错扣张顺有的错误，事前既无所闻，事后又不予适当处理和报告上级，这是一种严重的官僚主义失职行为，察哈尔省人民监察委员会决定给以警告处分。
    察哈尔省雁北专署公安办事处政治保卫科审讯股股员张绪，藉口张顺有没有介绍信，将张顺有推到别的机关，使张顺有三次徒劳往返。他自己既不检查处理结果，又不向领导方面报告，表现了严重的缺乏工作责任心和无组织无纪律的行为。察哈尔省人民监察委员会决定给以警告处分。
    在张顺有检举反革命分子的过程中，山西省崞县人民政府、县总工会及第二区人民政府，绥远省归绥市太平街派出所，察哈尔省阳高县第四区人民政府、四区东水地村干部宋增爱等对此问题采取了较为认真负责的态度，曾给予张顺有支持与帮助，对以上机关和人员已予以表扬。
