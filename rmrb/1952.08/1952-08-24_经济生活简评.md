    Brief Commentary on Economic Life

    Learn a Lesson from the Mountain Plow Problem

    The design and testing of the mountain plow has been delayed for over a year without a resolution. Following newspaper criticism, relevant departments have taken notice. What lessons should we learn from this incident?

    First, the leadership must strengthen political and ideological leadership over all business departments. If this leadership is abandoned, bourgeois ideology will inevitably spread. Some units are indifferent to the demands of mountain people who face particularly difficult production conditions and urgently need new agricultural implements. This is because they lack the perspective of industry leading agriculture and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance; they lack a comprehensive view of improving production and improving people's lives. They more or less operate the manufacture and supply of agricultural implements from a purely profit-seeking perspective. Therefore, they are not interested in things that are less profitable and more difficult. However, they vigorously carry out exhibitions and publicity for things that have not yet been tested well, in order to win "reputation" for their own units. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has recognized this in its self-criticism, which is very correct.

    Second, it is necessary to strengthen the connection between higher and lower levels and relevant business departments, and it is necessary to overthrow bureaucracy and red tape. Shanxi Province has been requesting the central Ministry of Agriculture to supply mountain plows, but it has not reported the test results of the new plow to the Ministry of Agriculture. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has been waiting for test reports to be sent from various places, but it has not inquired or checked. After a long time, Shanxi Province sent a test report, which clearly stated all the test conditions, but the drafter superfluously added a "details to follow" tag. The person in charge did not carefully review it, and it was forwarded layer by layer. The "follow-up report" naturally did not exist, but the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has been waiting. The National Agricultural Implement Conference assigned the task of trial-producing mountain plows to the Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute, but the Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute did not undertake this task. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory sent a letter to contact them, but received no reply. If this situation cannot be seriously corrected, nothing can be done well.

    Third, people's representative organs and newspapers should earnestly solve problems for the people, and must not simply "forward to relevant organs for handling" reasonable demands raised by the people. After "forwarding," they must continue to take responsibility and urge relevant departments to solve them seriously. Only in this way can they be truly responsible to the people.

    Improve Leadership over Li Chenggui's Mutual Aid Team

    Li Chenggui's high-yield achievements and high-yield experience are of concern to farmers across the country, especially in the Central South region. However, this year's early rice harvest in Li Chenggui's high-yield fields was much lower than the average yield of his ordinary fields. This incident may fuel the conservative ideas of some people and create obstacles to the patriotic production increase movement. Therefore, we must pay serious attention to this issue, learn from it, and make the broad masses of farmers understand the real reason for the reduced production in Li Chenggui's high-yield fields.

    The direct reason for the reduction in production in Li Chenggui's high-yield fields was "lodging." And one of the biggest concerns of many farmers about high yields is the fear that "too much fertilizer will cause lodging." Was too much fertilizer used in this high-yield field this year? If various conditions are well coordinated, it is not excessive. However, because the land was not plowed deep enough, and there was more nitrogen fertilizer than potassium and phosphorus fertilizer, the fertilizer seemed relatively excessive. Cadres leading agricultural production should learn an important lesson from this: agricultural technology is comprehensive, and to strive for high yields, various factors must be coordinated well. To coordinate various conditions well, it is not enough to rely solely on knowledge learned from books, nor is it enough to rely solely on the experience of labor models. To solve this problem, it is necessary to combine advanced agricultural science and technology with the high-yield experience of labor models, and provide specific technical guidance to farmers in a realistic manner.

    The reduction in production in Li Chenggui's high-yield fields also shows that the cadres leading production in the local area still have serious shortcomings in the cultivation and education work of Li Chenggui's mutual aid team. Subjectively speaking, the leadership from Hunan Province to Liling County is concerned about Li Chenggui's mutual aid team. They appointed a deputy county head and some strong technical personnel to be stationed in Baofeng Township to lead Li Chenggui's mutual aid team. However, they failed to solve some critical problems existing in this mutual aid team in a timely manner. For example, Li Chenggui himself wasted a lot of time attending unnecessary meetings, the living problems of poor and hired peasants in the mutual aid team were not well resolved, and the mutual aid team was scattered, so that it could not play its due role in the production process. "A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit," as long as we earnestly summarize and learn from these lessons, correct our technical guiding ideology, and improve the leadership of Li Chenggui's mutual aid team, Li Chenggui's mutual aid team will be able to continue to play its role in the patriotic production increase movement.

    经济生活简评
    从山地犁问题吸取教训
    山地犁的设计试验问题，拖了一年多没有解决；经过报纸的批评，有关部门已经注意起来了。我们应该从这件事情中吸取一些什么教训呢？
    第一、领导方面必须对一切业务部门加强政治思想领导；如果放弃了这种领导，资产阶级思想必然泛滥起来。有些单位所以对于生产条件特别困难，迫切需要新式农具的山地人民的要求漠不关心，就是因为他们缺乏以工业领导农业、加强工农联盟的观点；缺乏全面地提高生产、改善人民生活的观点；他们或多或少地是用单纯营利的观点来经营农具制造和供应事业的。因此，他们对于获利小、困难多的事不感兴趣；但对还没试验好的东西却大张旗鼓地进行展览和宣传，以便争取本单位的“名誉”。华北农业机械总厂在他们的检讨中已认识到这一点，这是很对的。
    第二、必须加强上下级和有关的业务部门之间的联系，必须打倒官僚主义和文牍主义。山西方面一直向中央农业部要求供应山地犁，但不向农业部报告新式犁的试验结果。华北农业机械总厂一直等待各地寄来试验报告，但不去催问和检查。过了很久，山西方面送来一个试验报告，这个报告明明把试验情况全部写上了，但被拟稿人赘上一个“详情续报”的尾巴，主管人没有认真审阅，就一层层转上去了。“续报”自然是没有的，而华北农业机械总厂却一直等待着。全国农具会议把试制山地犁的任务分配给西北农具研究所，而西北农具研究所却并没有把这个任务担当起来。华北农业机械总厂去信联系，也得不到答复。这种情况如果不能认真纠正过来，任何事情都是办不好的。
    第三、人民代表机关和报社应该认真替人民解决问题，决不能把人民提出的合理要求，“照转有关机关办理”了事。必须在“转”了之后，继续负起责任，督促有关部门认真解决，只有这样，才是真正对人民负责。
    改进对李呈桂互助组的领导
    李呈桂的丰产成绩和丰产经验，是全国农民特别是中南区农民所关心的。但是，今年李呈桂的丰产田的早稻的收成，却比他的一般田的平均产量还低得多。这件事可能助长某些人的保守思想，造成爱国增产运动的障碍。因此，我们必须严重地注意这个问题，从中吸取教训，并使广大农民群众明白李呈桂丰产田减产的真正原因。
    李呈桂的丰产田减产的直接原因是“倒禾”。而许多农民对于丰产的最大的顾虑之一就是害怕“多施肥要倒禾”。今年这块丰产田用的肥料算不算太多了呢？如果各种条件配合得好，是不算过多的。可是因为土地耕得不够深，肥料中氮肥多而用钾肥磷肥少，相对地说，肥料就显得过多了。领导农业生产的干部应当从这种事情中取得一个重要的教训：农业技术是综合性的，要争取丰产，必须把各种因素配合好。为了把各种条件配合好，只靠从书本上学来的知识是不够的，只靠劳动模范的经验也是不够的。要解决这个问题，必须使先进的农业科学技术和劳动模范的丰产经验结合起来，实事求是地对农民进行具体的技术指导。
    李呈桂丰产田的减产，也说明了在当地领导生产的干部，对于李呈桂互助组的培养教育工作还有严重的缺点。从主观上来说，从湖南省到醴陵县的领导方面对于李呈桂互助组是关心的。他们指定一个副县长和一些较强的技术人员，长驻在保丰乡领导李呈桂互助组。但他们对于这个互助组存在的某些带有关键性的问题，却没有及时地加以解决。例如李呈桂本人因参加不必要的会议浪费了很多时间，互助组内贫农雇农的生活问题没有很好地得到解决，互助组是涣散的，以致在生产过程中不能发挥到应有的作用等等。“吃一堑，长一智”，只要我们认真总结和吸取这些教训，端正技术指导思想，改进对李呈桂互助组的领导，李呈桂互助组在爱国增产运动中是能够继续发挥它的作用的。
