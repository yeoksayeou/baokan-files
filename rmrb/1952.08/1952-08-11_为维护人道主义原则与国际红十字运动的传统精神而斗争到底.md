The 18th International Red Cross Conference, which began on July 26th in Toronto, Canada, closed on the 7th of this month. At this conference, the delegations of our country, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and various people's democratic countries waged a resolute struggle to uphold humanitarian principles and the traditional spirit of the International Red Cross Movement.

The fundamental purpose and task of the International Red Cross Movement is to maintain humanity and peace. This is clearly stipulated in the International Red Cross Charter and the 1949 Geneva Conventions. However, the American aggressors have thoroughly destroyed and trampled upon the principles of humanity in their war of aggression against Korea. As people know, the American aggressors not only waged inhuman bacteriological warfare against China and Korea, but also, in disregard of the provisions of the Geneva Conventions, subjected the prisoners of war who fell into their hands to unprecedentedly horrific tortures, abuses, persecutions, and massacres, and attempted to forcibly detain them. They also carried out insane massacres and destructive bombings against the peaceful residents and peaceful cities of Korea. These monstrous crimes of the American aggressors have long aroused universal anger and condemnation from all righteous people. The International Red Cross Conference, bearing the banner of humanitarianism, should absolutely not turn a blind eye to these cruel crimes of the American aggressors.

The representatives of our country, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and various people's democratic countries, with irrefutable facts and evidence, severely condemned the United States' crimes against humanity and violations of the Geneva Conventions in its treatment of prisoners of war during the International Red Cross Conference. And in order to resolutely stop the crimes of the American aggressors, the representatives of China, the Soviet Union, and Poland respectively proposed measures to safeguard the dignity of the Geneva Conventions, to conclude a convention prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, and to ratify and abide by the Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons. These proposals themselves fully embody a genuine concern and sincere desire for maintaining humanity and relieving human suffering. Therefore, the struggle waged by our country and the Soviet Union, etc., for this purpose, has been supported by all upright people.

The American aggressors, subjected to righteous condemnation, carried out despicable and shameful sabotage activities against the International Red Cross Conference. The U.S. government and its accomplice, the British government, deliberately did not send official representatives to participate in this conference, but only sent so-called "observer delegations" to carry out behind-the-scenes activities. Their approach was both because they dared not confront truth and facts, and because they were trying to hide behind the fig leaf of so-called "not discussing political issues" to manipulate and undermine the conference. The chief observer of the so-called "observer delegation" sent by the U.S. government, Mr. Marshall, dismissed the condemnations raised by the representatives of China, the Soviet Union, Korea, and the people's democratic countries regarding the crimes of the United States in waging bacteriological warfare and violating the Geneva Conventions by massacring prisoners of war as "political propaganda," and directed his lackeys to prevent the representatives of China and the Soviet Union, etc., from speaking, or to force the meeting to be interrupted. The chairman of the conference, Mr. Macaulay, the chairman of the Standing Committee, Mr. Francois-Poncet, and the chairman of the 21st Board of Governors of the League of Red Cross Societies, Mr. Sandström, all acted according to the orders of the United States. They controlled the meeting, endlessly parroting the Americans, using the same absurd excuses of so-called "avoiding raising political issues" and prohibiting "politically-involved" discussions to obstruct the conference from conducting serious discussions on any issues related to condemning the United States and maintaining humanity. Under the manipulation of the United States and its lackeys, the conference and the General Affairs Committee, without any real discussion, repeatedly and unreasonably rejected the proposals of our country and the Soviet Union, which fully complied with the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross, and openly refused to study the evidence provided by our country of the United States' conduct of bacteriological warfare. Obviously, "not discussing political issues" has become a haven for the United States to escape righteous condemnation, and in fact, this is the most despicable and vile political conspiracy that the United States is playing.

The destructive activities of the United States have seriously damaged the International Red Cross Movement and its traditional spirit. Because the issue of the cruel crimes of the United States in conducting bacteriological warfare and massacring prisoners of war cannot be discussed and condemned, the International Red Cross Conference's position of upholding humanitarianism cannot but be seriously damaged. Obviously, just as the United States has turned the United Nations into a tool for it to wage wars of aggression, the United States is now also attempting to turn the pure banner of the International Red Cross Organization into a disguise for its crimes against humanity. This can be clearly seen by looking at the fact that, under the manipulation of the United States, the International Red Cross Conference passed the proposal put forward by the South Korean Syngman Rhee bandit gang, directed by the United States, demanding so-called "free and full inspections" of the Korean prisoner-of-war camps by the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as the joint proposal by Britain and Belgium to investigate the United States' violations of the Geneva Conventions. People will wonder, since the United States and its servants have so arrogantly rejected the proposals of our country and the Soviet Union, etc., to condemn the United States, and have refused our country's offer to provide evidence of the United States' conduct of bacteriological warfare to the conference, then why are they so eager to conduct "inspections" and "investigations"? Obviously, there is only one reason, and that is that the United States is attempting to use this to whitewash its crimes and exonerate itself from its guilt. The fact that the United States instigated the South Korean Syngman Rhee bandit gang to propose that the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross, which has been proven by facts to be a tool of the U.S. invasion forces, inspect the Korean prisoner-of-war camps further proves this point. But this shameless attempt by the American aggressors will absolutely not achieve its purpose. Because the facts of the United States' violation of the Geneva Conventions in massacring prisoners of war are not only recognized by all righteous people in the world, but are also personally acknowledged by the former U.S. prisoner-of-war camp commander, Mr. Colson. As for the fact that the United States conducted bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, it has not only been admitted by the commander of the U.S. Korean war zone, Mr. Van Fleet, but has also been confirmed and published by the authoritative International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team after on-site investigation. In the future, if any truly just and honest international organization wants to investigate, we believe that they will also be able to prove this ironclad fact. Any attempt by the American imperialists to exonerate themselves from their guilt is impossible to achieve its purpose.

The facts are very clear: the efforts of our country and the Soviet Union, etc., at the International Red Cross Conference are entirely for the purpose of enabling the International Red Cross Organization and the Red Cross Movement to maintain its traditional spirit of upholding humanity and peace, and to continue to work in accordance with this traditional spirit, while the actions of the United States and its accomplices are completely the opposite; they are arrogantly attempting to destroy this organization, to make it deviate from its humanitarian position and to completely serve the American aggressors. Therefore, all upright people in the world who respect humanitarianism and cherish the Red Cross Movement must closely unite and act together, and wage a resolute struggle to uphold humanitarianism and the traditional spirit of the International Red Cross Movement.

### 为维护人道主义原则与国际红十字运动的传统精神而斗争到底

    为维护人道主义原则与国际红十字运动的传统精神而斗争到底
    七月二十六日在加拿大多伦多开始举行的第十八届国际红十字大会，已于本月七日闭幕了。在这次会议上，我国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及各人民民主国家的代表团为维护人道主义原则与国际红十字运动的传统精神而进行了坚决的斗争。
    国际红十字运动的基本目的和任务，在于维护人道与和平，这是国际红十字章程及一九四九年日内瓦各项公约所明确规定了的。然而美国侵略者在侵略朝鲜的战争中已彻底破坏和蹂躏了人道主义的原则。人们知道，美国侵略者不仅对中朝两国进行了违反人道的细菌战，并且不顾日内瓦各项公约的规定，对落入他们手中的战俘施行了史无前例的恐怖酷刑、虐待、迫害和屠杀，并企图加以强迫扣留，对朝鲜的和平居民及和平城市进行了疯狂的屠杀和毁灭性的轰炸。美国侵略者的这些滔天罪行，早已引起了全体正义人类的普遍愤怒与谴责。揭橥着人道主义旗帜的国际红十字大会，对于美国侵略者的这种残酷罪行绝对不应该熟视无睹。
    我国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及各人民民主国家的代表以无可辩驳的事实和证据，在这次国际红十字大会上对美国违反人道、破坏日内瓦各项公约的罪行提出了严厉的谴责。并且为了坚决制止美国侵略者的罪行，我国、苏联和波兰代表分别提出了关于维护日内瓦公约的尊严的措施、关于缔结禁止使用原子武器的公约和关于批准和遵守禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书等提案。这些提案的本身就充分体现了对维护人道主义及解除人类痛苦的真正关怀和真诚愿望。因而，我国及苏联等国为此而进行的斗争，得到了一切正直人类的支持。
    受到正义谴责的美国侵略者，对国际红十字大会进行了卑鄙可耻的破坏活动。美国政府和它的帮凶英国政府故意没有派遣正式代表参加这次大会，而只派了所谓“观察员代表团”进行幕后活动。它们的这种做法，一方面是因为不敢与真理和事实做对证，另一方面则是企图躲在所谓“不谈政治问题”的遮羞布的后面，操纵并破坏大会。美国政府派遣的所谓“观察员代表团”首席观察员马舍尔，把我国、苏联、朝鲜及人民民主国家代表对美国进行细菌战及破坏日内瓦公约虐杀战俘的罪行所提出的谴责，一概说是“政治宣传”，并指使其奴仆们阻止我国及苏联等国代表的发言，或者强使会议中断举行。大会主席马考莱、常设委员会主席法朗索阿—庞赛以及红十字会协会二十一届理事会主席桑兹特朗，都是按照美国的命令行事的。他们把持会议，喋喋不休地向美国人学舌，以同样荒谬的所谓“避免提出政治问题”、禁止从事“涉及政治”的讨论为理由，阻挠大会对任何有关谴责美国以及维护人道主义的问题进行认真的讨论。在美国及其仆从的操纵下，大会及总务委员会都没有经过真正的讨论，一再无理地否决了我国和苏联完全符合于红十字人道原则的提案，并且对于我国提供的美国进行细菌战的罪证公然拒绝加以研究。显然，“不谈政治问题”已成为美国逃避正义谴责的避难所了，事实上这就是美国所玩弄的最卑鄙下流的政治阴谋。
    美国的破坏活动严重地伤害了国际红十字运动及其传统精神。因为对于美国进行细菌战及虐杀战俘的这种残酷罪行的问题不能加以讨论和谴责，那末国际红十字大会的维护人道主义的立场就不能不受到严重的损害。显然地，正如美国已将联合国变为它进行侵略战争的工具一样，现在美国也正企图把国际红十字组织的纯洁旗帜变成它违反人道罪行的掩饰物。这只要看一看这次国际红十字大会在美国的操纵下，通过了美国指使南朝鲜李承晚匪帮所提出的要求所谓红十字国际委员会对朝鲜战俘营“进行自由和充分视察”的提案，以及由英比两国所提出的对美国违反日内瓦公约行为进行调查的联合提案，就可以一目了然。人们都会奇怪，美国及其仆从既已蛮横地否决了我国及苏联等国谴责美国的提案，而又拒绝我国向大会提供美国进行细菌战的罪证，那末为什么他们又亟亟于要进行“视察”和“调查”呢？显然，理由只有一个，那就是美国企图借此来洗刷它的罪行，开脱它的罪责。美国主使南朝鲜李承晚匪帮提出要由已被事实证明是美国侵略军的工具的所谓红十字国际委员会来视察朝鲜战俘营的这一件事，更证明了这一点。但是美国侵略者的这种无耻企图绝对无法达到目的。因为美国违反日内瓦公约虐杀战俘的事实，不仅是全世界正义人士所公认的，而且是美国前战俘营长官柯尔生所亲自承认了的。讲到美国在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的事实，则不仅已由美国的朝鲜战地司令官范佛里特亲口承认，并且已由权威的国际民主法协调查团经过现场调查加以证实公布了。将来如有任何真正公正的诚实的国际团体要来调查，我们相信他们也必然能够证明这种铁一般的事实。美帝国主义者任何企图开脱它的罪责的阴谋都是不可能达到它的目的的。
    事实非常明显，我国和苏联等国在国际红十字大会上的努力，完全是为了要使国际红十字组织和红十字运动保持它维护人道与和平的传统精神，并遵循着这种传统精神继续工作，而美国及其帮凶的做法，则完全与此相反，他们蛮横地企图破坏这个组织，使它离开人道主义的立场而完全为美国侵略者服务。因此，世界上一切尊重人道主义与爱护红十字运动的正直人类，必须紧密地团结起来和行动起来，为维护人道主义与国际红十字运动的传统精神，而进行坚决的斗争。
