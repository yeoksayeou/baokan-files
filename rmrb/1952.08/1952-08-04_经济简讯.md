    Yunnan Provincial State-Owned Trading Company Decides to Strengthen Trade Work in Ethnic Minority Areas
    Based on the needs of the ethnic minority people and the actual conditions in various places, state-owned trading companies in Yunnan Province have formulated procurement and sales plans for the second half of this year, with planned procurement and sales figures increasing compared to the first half of the year. For example, the trade company plans to purchase twelve kinds of medicinal materials unique to the Lijiang Special District, such as Coptis chinensis, Fritillaria, and Cordyceps sinensis, which is an increase of 136% compared to the first half of the year. The trade company also plans to purchase a large quantity of the famous medicinal material "Sanqi" produced in Guangnan and Maguan counties in the Wenshan Special District. In order to do a good job in procurement and sales, the Yunnan Provincial State-Owned Trading Company has decided to greatly increase the number of trade organizations and cadres in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated or mixed communities. After the establishment of these trade organizations, the trade work in various places will rapidly develop from towns and cities to the mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities.
    Xikang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau Expands the Supply of Edible Salt to Ethnic Minorities
    Since the beginning of spring this year, various branches of the Xikang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau have mobilized and organized many merchants to supply edible salt to ethnic minority areas. In order to encourage private merchants to operate, the Xikang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau has specifically stipulated preferential measures such as reducing or exempting salt taxes and reducing wholesale amounts for salt sold to ethnic minority areas. The People's Bank has also provided loan assistance to merchants lacking funds. As a result, the number of salt merchants and peddlers going to ethnic minority areas is increasing day by day. In Xichang County alone, there are more than 170 salt merchants going to the Yi ethnic area. The business of salt industry branches in various places has therefore expanded rapidly. At present, many Yi people living in remote mountainous areas in the Xichang Special District can buy edible salt from merchants.

In order to carry out a regional grain weevil eradication campaign in August and September with leadership and organization, the Central South China Grain Company established a pest control headquarters, and each province established a pest control squadron. Pest control groups were established in each city, county, and warehouse unit, and a command structure for pest control work was established from top to bottom, concentrating forces under unified leadership to gradually eradicate pests from point to surface.
