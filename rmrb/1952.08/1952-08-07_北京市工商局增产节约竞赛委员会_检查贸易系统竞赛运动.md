    The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce's Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy convened a meeting of managers from various state-owned specialized companies in Beijing on July 28th to inspect the patriotic production increase and economy practice competition movement of "promoting industrial products with wholesale as the main focus" in the trade system.
    The patriotic production increase and economy practice competition in the Beijing trade system began on July 1st. Currently, various state-owned specialized companies have completed tasks such as clearing warehouses, categorizing goods, and reviewing commodity prices. In companies where employees have been mobilized, labor unions and administrative departments have signed collective contracts. At the same time, a wave of challenges and responses has been set off between individuals, units, and companies. Employees have a high level of enthusiasm and have put forward many rationalization proposals. For example, Wang Baozhen, an employee of the Beijing Petroleum Company, proposed "direct dispatch and direct allocation" and "delivery to customers on behalf of them," saving more than 8 million yuan in freight and miscellaneous expenses per truckload of goods, reducing the loss rate by more than 90%. Significant achievements have also been made in promoting industrial products. For example, employees of the First Wholesale Department of the Beijing Department Store overcame the passive state of "waiting for customers" and actively contacted government agencies, troops, factories, and mines. In twenty days, they sold more than 2,000 bicycles that had been backlogged for a long time. Due to the active business development of employees, the company exceeded its total monthly sales target by 0.98% in the first half of July. Employees of the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company carried samples and price lists to make contacts, and in ten days, sales of slow-moving goods accounted for 58.52% of the monthly sales plan.
    The development of the movement is still very uneven. Although most companies have taken action, a few companies have not yet fully mobilized. Some units have not even established an organization for the Patriotic Production Increase and Economy Practice Committee to this day, and some units, although established, do not have a permanent office; some units have formulated sales and savings plans, but because these plans have not been fully discussed by the masses of employees, it is difficult to form a mass competition movement. The reason for the above shortcomings is mainly that some company leaders do not pay enough attention to the movement. For example, the leaders of the state-owned China Pharmaceutical and Coal Construction Municipal Companies are still busy with other affairs and have not yet made specific arrangements for this central task. The Municipal Native Products and Retail Companies started the movement earlier, but due to the lack of in-depth inspection by the leadership, they know very little about the specific situation below.
    In response to the above situation, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce's Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy pointed out the significance of carrying out the production increase and economy practice competition movement centered on promoting industrial products, and required various state-owned specialized companies to strengthen leadership of this work. Companies that have not established the Production Increase and Economy Practice Committee and its office should quickly establish them. Plans that have not been discussed by employees should be fully discussed by mobilizing employees, and specific plans for units, groups, and individuals should be formulated. At the same time, leading cadres must change their style, go deep into the goods yards and sales units, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. In the movement, political and ideological leadership and propaganda and mobilization work must be strengthened, and the principle of "developing production and protecting labor" must be resolutely implemented. High priority must be given to the safety and health of employees, and the welfare and rewards of employees must be appropriately resolved. Typical figures and advanced units should be commended and their experiences introduced in a timely manner, so as to rapidly and further develop the movement.

    北京市工商局增产节约竞赛委员会
    检查贸易系统竞赛运动
    北京市人民政府工商局爱国增产节约竞赛委员会于七月二十八日召开北京市各国营专业公司经理会议，检查贸易系统“以批发为主推销工业品”的爱国增产节约竞赛运动。
    北京市贸易系统爱国增产节约竞赛是从七月一日开始的。目前各国营专业公司已完成清理仓库、商品排队和审查商品价格等项工作。在职工发动起来的公司里，工会与行政部门都签订了集体合同。同时个人与个人、单位与单位、公司与公司，已掀起了挑战应战的热潮。职工们工作情绪很高，提出了许多合理化建议。例如北京市石油公司职工王宝珍提出“直调直拨”、“代客送货”的建议，每车货节省运费及杂费八十余万元，降低损耗率在百分之九十以上。在推销工业品方面也有显著成绩。如北京市百货公司第一批发部职工克服“坐等顾客”的被动状态，而主动地和机关、部队、厂矿联系，在二十天中已销完积压很久的两千多辆自行车。由于职工主动的开展业务，该公司七月份上半月即超额完成全月销货任务百分之零点九八。北京市花纱布公司职工携带样品、价目表出外联系，十天中推销冷背货占全月销货计划百分之五十八点五二。
    运动发展还很不平衡。多数公司虽已行动起来了，但仍有少数公司尚未完全行动起来。有的单位甚至连爱国增产节约委员会的机构至今尚未建立，有的单位虽然建立了，却没有经常的办事机构；有些单位虽然制订了销货和节约计划，但由于这些计划没有经过职工群众充分的讨论，也就很难形成群众性的竞赛运动。存在上述缺点的原因，主要是有些公司领导干部对运动重视不够。如国营中国医药、煤建等市公司领导干部还在忙于其他事务，对此项中心任务至今还没有具体部署。土产、零售等市公司运动开展较早，因为领导上缺乏深入检查，对下面具体情况很少了解。
    北京市人民政府工商局爱国增产节约竞赛委员会针对上述情况，指出开展以推销工业品为中心的增产节约竞赛运动的意义，要求各国营专业公司加强对此项工作的领导，凡增产节约竞赛委员会及办公室未建立起来的公司应迅速建立起来，计划未经职工讨论的都要发动职工充分讨论，并订出单位、小组和个人的具体计划。同时领导干部必须转变作风，深入货场和销货单位，及时发现问题解决问题。运动中必须加强政治思想领导和宣传鼓动工作，坚决贯彻“发展生产、保护劳动”的方针，对于职工安全卫生工作必须高度重视，并要适当的解决职工福利和奖励问题。对典型人物和先进单位要及时表扬和介绍经验，把运动迅速地进一步的开展起来。
