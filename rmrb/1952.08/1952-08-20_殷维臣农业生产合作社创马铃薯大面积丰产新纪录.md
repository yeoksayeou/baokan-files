    Yin Weichen Agricultural Production Cooperative Sets New Record for Large-Area Potato Bumper Harvest
    Comrade Editor: The potatoes of the Yin Weichen Agricultural Production Cooperative, which challenged the farmers of the Beijing suburbs, have had a bumper harvest. The entire cooperative's twenty-six mu of land yielded an average of 3,310 jin of potatoes per mu, exceeding the original plan by 310 jin and exceeding the local agricultural output by 38 percent; of which 12.27 mu yielded an average of 4,261 jin per mu, setting a new record for large-area potato bumper harvest in the Beijing suburbs.
    The bumper harvest of potatoes at the Yin Weichen Agricultural Production Cooperative is the result of organization, unified management, increased investment, and improved technology. During spring plowing, they generally practiced deep plowing, applied more base fertilizer, and watered with manure frequently in stages; when sowing, they mixed the seeds with plant ash and adopted advanced methods of deep sowing and shallow covering, and second trenching; after germination, they implemented seedling control to nourish the seedlings and watered reasonably in stages. The potatoes of the Yin Weichen Agricultural Production Cooperative were intercropped with corn, and would have been even more productive if not intercropped. After the potato harvest, they summarized the experiences of the bumper harvest and are now actively preparing for autumn vegetable sowing to strive for even greater harvests.

    殷维臣农业生产合作社创马铃薯大面积丰产新纪录
    编辑同志：向北京郊区农民挑战的殷维臣农业生产合作社的马铃薯已经丰收了。全社二十六亩地，平均每亩收马铃薯三千三百一十斤，超过原计划三百一十斤，超过当地农产量的百分之三十八；其中十二亩二分七，平均每亩产四千二百六十一斤，创造了京郊马铃薯大面积丰产的新纪录。
    殷维臣农业生产合作社马铃薯的丰收，是组织起来、统一经营、扩大投资、改进技术的结果。春耕时，他们普遍实行深耕，多施底肥，分期多次浇灌粪水；播种时用草木灰拌种，并采用先进的深播浅盖、二次封沟的办法；发芽后又实行蹲苗养秧，合理地分期灌水。殷维臣农业生产合作社的马铃薯是和玉米兼作的，如果不兼作还能丰产。马铃薯收获后，他们总结了丰产经验，现正在积极准备秋菜播种，争取更大丰收。  顾英
