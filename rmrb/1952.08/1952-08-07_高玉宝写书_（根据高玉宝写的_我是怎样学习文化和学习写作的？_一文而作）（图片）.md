    Gao Yubao Writes a Book

    Twenty-two. I remembered Lenin's words: "Study, study, and study again." I thought: Learning culture is also writing characters, writing books is also writing characters, let’s keep writing. If I can't write well, I'll just treat it as my own diary.

    Twenty-three. Chief Chi of the Propaganda Section saw that I was studying diligently and personally ordered a study notebook for me, gave me a pencil, and also asked Propaganda Officer Comrade Shan Qi to teach me culture. I was very moved and made up my mind: if I can't finish this book in one year, I'll write it for two years; if I can't finish it in two years, I'll write it for five years!

    Twenty-four. There are many difficulties, and my determination wavered. However, I thought of the story of the 25,000-li Long March and the arduous struggle of the Three Down to Jiangnan. Our people's army has never bowed its head in front of the enemy, how can it bow its head in the face of difficulties in cultural learning? But writing a book is not like learning culture, sometimes I can't remember some things, I get so anxious that I break out in a sweat, and I walk back and forth in the room.

    二十二、我想起列宁的话：“学习，学习，再学习”。我想：光学文化也是写字，写书也是写字，写下去吧。要是写不好，就作为自己的回忆日记。
    二十三、宣教股迟股长看我用心学习，亲自给我订学习本，给我铅笔，还叫宣教干事单奇同志教我学文化。我非常感动，就下了决心：这书一年写不成，就写两年，两年不成，就写五年！
    二十四、困难是很多的，我的决心动摇了。可是，我想起两万五千里长征的故事和三下江南的艰苦斗争。我们人民的军队，在敌人面前从没低过头，还能在文化学习的困难面前低头吗？不过写书不像学文化，有时有些事情想不起来，急得满头大汗，在房子里走来走去。
