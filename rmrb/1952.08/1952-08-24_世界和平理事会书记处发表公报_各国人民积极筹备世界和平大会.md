The people of all countries wholeheartedly support the resolution of the World Peace Council, and peace fighters are carrying out large-scale preparations for this congress.

    Various forms of consultation activities in many countries have contributed to the preparatory work for the congress. Peace fighters in India, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, China, Bulgaria, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Albania, Korea, Japan, Iran, Brazil, Chile, and other countries have decided to arrange widespread discussions. This extensive discussion movement has taken different forms in different countries. In France and Italy, peace fighters have held thousands of small meetings in homes, streets, and districts, in many enterprises, and in rural areas. All suggestions raised at the meetings were discussed, the best of which have been adopted, and representatives to the local peace conferences have been elected. These local conferences will be responsible for preparing the work of the provincial (district) and national peace conferences.

    Some countries have convened workers' peace conferences and farmers' peace conferences to discuss the contributions that workers and farmers should make in the struggle to safeguard peace. The issues that these people are particularly concerned about have been given due consideration during the discussions.

    Peace fighters in Belgium have decided to send delegations to visit deputies of local and provincial representative bodies and members of parliament to convey the people's will to strive for peace.

    In the Transvaal region of the Union of South Africa, peace fighters have decided to hold a Peace Week.

    This movement, characterized by intense activity, will help consolidate the peace movement in various countries organizationally, strengthen local peace committees, and establish new peace committees.

    Japan, France, Romania, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Thailand, and many other countries will hold national peace conferences before December of this year.

    In this way, the preparatory activities for the World People's Peace Congress will make the declaration of the World Peace Council known to everyone in the world. These activities will create the preconditions for the World People's Peace Congress to become a powerful demonstration, showing the will of the people of all countries to defend peace.
