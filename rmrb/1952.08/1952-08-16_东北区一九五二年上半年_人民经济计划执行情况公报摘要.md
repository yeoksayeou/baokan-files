The Economic Planning Commission of the Northeast People's Government recently issued a public communiqué on the implementation of the national economic plan in the Northeast Region for the first half of 1952. The following is an abstract: The economic construction in the Northeast Region in the first half of 1952 was carried out during the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and on the basis of the victorious conclusion of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, a warm patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched. Therefore, the plan for the first half of the year was successfully completed, greatly exceeding the level of the same period last year.

	Growth of Industrial Production and Technological Improvement
	In the first half of this year, all employees of state-owned and public-owned industries displayed high labor enthusiasm, vigorously promoted advanced experiences, completed 104.8 percent of the production plan for the first half of the year, reached 50.4 percent of the annual plan, and increased by 57.6 percent compared with the same period last year. Among them, state-owned industries completed 106.8 percent of the plan, an increase of 57.6 percent over the same period last year. The total output value of the Ministry of Industry completed 105.4 percent of the plan for the first half of the year, an increase of 54.3 percent compared with the same period last year.

	In the first half of the year, state-owned and public-owned industries focused on increasing the production of various major means of production to meet the needs of increasingly developing production and construction. The total output value of means of production completed 105.9 percent of the plan for the first half of the year, an increase of 61.3 percent over the same period last year. The total output value of consumer goods completed 103.3 percent of the plan for the first half of the year, an increase of 51.6 percent over the same period last year. The percentage increase of each major industrial sector in the first half of 1952 compared with the first half of 1951 is as follows:

	In terms of means of production: electricity 25.3; coal mining 35; iron and steel 69; machinery and parts 96.8; chemicals 95.4; building materials 64.4; forest logging 83.9.

	In terms of consumer goods: textiles 58; paper 97.5; cultural and artistic supplies 187.1; soap and cosmetics 195.7; matches 207.8.

	In the first half of the year, all employees of state-owned and public-owned industries further developed the search for "tricks" and the promotion of advanced experiences in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In 1951, various "tricks" and advanced experiences were mostly technical improvements; in 1952, on the basis of improving production technology, advanced experiences in improving labor organization and saving raw materials and machinery maintenance were systematically promoted, resulting in significant improvements in industrial production levels.

	In terms of equipment maintenance: the power industry implemented rapid maintenance methods, reducing the maintenance time of power generation equipment by 33 to 64 percent, and the line maintenance time by 56.4 percent; unified coordinated maintenance was implemented, so that the maintenance of production equipment and power maintenance were carried out in a planned manner, and the utilization rate of power generation equipment and the operating rate of enterprises were improved.

	In terms of improving labor organization: the machinery industry promoted the organization of rhythmic production according to instruction diagrams, changing the blind rush and the chaotic phenomenon of production being slack in the front and tight in the back. Among them, the Machinery Factory No. 3, which achieved the greatest effect, increased its output month by month, and its labor productivity increased by 143 percent compared with the same period last year. In addition, the method of organizing production according to instruction diagrams has been started to be promoted in the coal mining industry, the electrical appliance industry and other industrial sectors. The improvement of labor organization has enabled various technical improvements to be carried out in an organized manner, thereby improving the level of industrial production. This is a major reform in production management. The textile industry continued to promote the Hao Jianxiu work method and the 1951 weaving work method, which increased the hourly output of cotton yarn per spindle by an average of 17.7 percent compared with last year, and the hourly output of cotton cloth per machine by an average of 9 percent compared with last year.

	In terms of saving raw materials: using inferior coal for power generation alone can save 400,000 tons of good coal annually; rubber factories replace raw rubber with recycled rubber and promote the mechanical cold pressing method, which can save 8.3 percent of the annual raw rubber consumption in the second half of the year.

	The promotion of advanced experience has also achieved great results in local industries. Due to the promotion of the advanced oil extraction method of the Li Chuanjiang group, the oil yield of soybeans has increased from the quota of 10.5 percent this year to 14.04 percent, and the average oil yield has reached 12 percent, with an extra 1,500 tons of oil for every 100,000 tons of soybeans. This advanced experience has been widely promoted. Other advanced experiences, such as using bran to make wine and increasing the wine yield, have also been promoted.

	However, the phenomenon of poor quality of certain products in state-owned and public-owned industries is still very serious. In particular, the quality of some products in the machinery, paper making, soap, and rubber shoe industries in state-owned industries, as well as daily necessities such as matches and ceramics in local industries, urgently needs to be improved.

	In addition, the trial production of new products in the machinery industry has not completed the plan, and the phenomenon of not producing according to variety specifications is still very common in electrical products. Therefore, in the future, special attention should be paid to improving product quality and strictly implementing the variety plan and new product trial production plan in the promotion of advanced experience.

	In the first half of the year, while completing the national plan, all employees of state-owned and public-owned industries actively responded to Chairman Gao Gang's call to increase production and save 8 million tons of grain wealth; after extensive and in-depth discussions, the production increase and savings plans of state-owned and public-owned factories, mines and basic construction units have reached 13.54 million tons of grain, and actions have begun and preliminary results have been achieved.

	In the first half of the year, after the "Five-Anti" movement, the state economy supported private industries that were conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and private industries have also developed. In the first half of the year, the total output value of state-commissioned processing in Shenyang increased by 64.6 percent compared with the same period last year. Therefore, compared with the same period last year, the total output value of private industries in the city increased by 8.6 percent; the number of households increased by 6.6 percent; and the number of employed workers increased by 28.4 percent.

	Basic Construction Has Been Raised to the Top Priority
	The total workload of basic construction projects in 1952 is 161 percent of that of last year. The industrial aspect increased by 125 percent compared to last year, of which 30 percent belongs to the construction of new enterprises, and the workload of heavy industry accounts for 72.7 percent of industrial construction. Industrial basic construction has been raised to the top priority of economic construction.

	In the first half of 1952, various ministries and bureaus completed 22.4 percent of the annual planned workload. Construction units with more than 10 billion yuan in various provinces and cities completed 13.8 percent of the annual planned workload.

	The construction of power stations and coal mines, railways, highways, post and telecommunications, and water conservancy has mostly completed the scheduled progress, and some projects have overfulfilled the planned progress.

	Due to insufficient design and construction technical forces, the commencement period of the project was late, and the responsibility system was not implemented in project management. Although the planned progress has progressed compared with previous years, it is still slow, and the development of various construction departments is unbalanced. The quality of the project is still behind the technical requirements. After inspection and serious criticism, various construction departments have mobilized workers to find ways and "tricks" to improve various systems. The shortcomings of poor project quality have now begun to be corrected and will continue to be improved.

	In strengthening construction forces: through the comprehensive balance of the plan, the construction organization has been adjusted, and the number and scope of fixed workers have been expanded; partial mechanized construction is implemented on larger construction sites. Basic construction labor is uniformly allocated according to region and type of work. In organizing the production and distribution of local building materials, a method of combining production and sales by region is adopted, and the project location planning committee uniformly dispatches them according to the time limit to ensure timely supply of materials. These have created favorable conditions for engineering construction.

	Great achievements have also been made in learning and promoting advanced experiences. For example, after adopting the new standard for building structures, more than 5 percent of the civil construction investment can be saved from the design. Vigorously promote the assembly line operation method and new tools for wood, tile and other types of work, greatly improving work efficiency, especially learning from the Soviet Union's parallel operation of vertical shafts, concrete vacuum operation and rapid drilling methods, which have played a huge role in shortening the construction period. More than 300 items of tool improvements and creations have been made, and new creations continue to emerge. However, the current promotion work is not universal enough, various conservative ideas must be further overcome, and the political work on the construction site needs to be strengthened.

	Development of Agricultural Production and Water Conservancy
	This spring, the sown area in the entire region only completed 98.4 percent of the spring sowing plan, an increase of 1.2 percent compared with last year. Among them, grain crops completed 100.6 percent of the plan, an increase of 2.8 percent compared with last year; the sown area of industrial raw material crops did not complete the plan. The reason why the sown area in the entire region (including reclamation) did not complete the plan is mainly because some provinces and counties did not pay close attention to the leadership of spring plowing, and some areas suffered from spring drought, some sandy land was left uncultivated, and some cultivated land was converted into afforestation land.

	This spring, the fertilized area in the entire region has expanded from 58.9 percent of the total sown area last year to 63.2 percent (excluding summer topdressing), and many advanced agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have reached 100 percent. The sown area of high-quality seeds of major grain crops has reached 1.1 million hectares, an increase of 52.9 percent compared with last year.

	In the first half of the year, a total of 29,398 new agricultural implements were promoted, completing 97.4 percent of the plan. Due to the strengthening of technical guidance in the promotion process, new agricultural implements have played a good role in actual production, and are therefore generally welcomed by the masses. In the first half of the year, 46,500 tons of ammonium sulfate, 480,000 tons of soybean cake (including fertilizer and feed), and 14 kinds of pesticides totaling 2,500 tons were supplied to rural areas. At the same time, under the impetus of the patriotic production increase movement, careful cultivation and meticulous work in summer hoeing, timely weeding, and a large amount of topdressing have become mass actions, which have created favorable conditions for increasing unit area yield.

	The 28 state-owned and public-owned mechanical farms in the entire region have a total sown area of 86,900 hectares. Although the mechanization of plowing operations has reached 96.8 percent and the mechanization of sowing operations has reached 91.6 percent, they only completed 77.9 percent of the plan due to the failure to fully utilize mechanical efficiency and poor labor organization.

	In terms of water conservancy, the spring repair projects of the four major irrigation areas of Chahayang, Lishu, Panshan, and Guoqian Banner have been completed, solving the drainage problems of rice fields in Panshan and Guoqian Banner, and playing a certain role in drought resistance and flood prevention. The dredging project of the Rao River flowing eastward, the embankment repair project of Erlongwan on the Yangchang River, and the embankment relocation project of the Dongsha River have also been completed, which can protect 40,000 hectares of farmland from water damage. This spring, the construction of the western protective forest belt completed a total of 26,000 hectares, exceeding the spring plan by 23 percent. Together with the afforestation of various provinces and cities, preliminary statistics show that the entire region has afforested a total of 88,000 hectares this spring, completing 102.8 percent of the spring afforestation plan.

	Development of Transportation
	In the first half of the year, the number of tons of cargo transported by Northeast Railway completed 99.1 percent of the plan, an increase of 25.1 percent compared with the same period last year. Some of the main materials have exceeded the plan, and some are close to completing the plan. Due to the continued implementation of regional production and sales and reasonable transportation of coal, grain, wood, and cement, the facing and long-distance transportation has been continuously reduced. This year, on the basis of the greatly improved transportation efficiency in the second half of last year, the employees of Northeast Railway continued to improve their work, and launched the 500-kilometer full-load over-axis campaign in the second quarter, achieving new results. The average net load of freight cars has reached 29.2 tons, the average total weight of trains has reached 1,217 tons, and the average daily mileage of locomotives has reached 441.8 kilometers, all exceeding the plan. 500-kilometer locomotives account for 43.5 percent of the total number of locomotives. The number of tons of highway freight only completed 92 percent of the plan, but increased by 105.2 percent compared with the same period last year.

	Increase in the Number of Employees and Labor Productivity
	In the first half of this year, due to the development of economic construction, the number of employees in various departments increased significantly. At the end of June this year, the total number of employees in Northeast China increased by 279,000 compared with the end of 1951; among them: state-owned and public-owned industries increased by 99,200; basic construction departments increased by 58,700; agriculture and forestry departments increased by 36,800; and transportation departments increased by 16,400.

	In the first half of this year, after the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the launch of the patriotic production increase and savings campaign, the level of awareness of the working class in the entire region has been further improved, and the enthusiasm for labor has been even higher. Due to the continuous emergence of advanced experiences, labor productivity in the industrial sector has increased by 20.9 percent compared with the same period last year; among them: state-owned industries increased by 23.7 percent. In state-owned industries, the labor productivity of the Ministry of Industry system completed 103.7 percent of the plan for the first half of the year, an increase of 28.9 percent compared with the same period last year.

	Development of Cultural, Educational and Health Undertakings and Improvement of People's Material Life
	In the first half of this year, the number of schools and students at all levels has increased. The number of universities has increased to 34, an increase of 78.9 percent compared with the same period last year, and the number of students has increased by 35.1 percent compared with the same period last year; the number of secondary technical schools is 75, and the number of students has increased by 38.5 percent compared with the same period last year; the number of middle schools and normal schools is 434, with 275,680 students; and the number of primary schools is 36,500, with 5,032,600 students. In July this year, 9,670 students will graduate from universities and technical schools.

	In the first half of the year, more than 47 million copies of various books and periodicals were published, an increase of 30 percent compared with the same period last year. The average daily circulation of Northeast Daily in the first half of the year was 263,390 copies, an increase of 34.6 percent compared with the same period last year. A mass literacy campaign has been launched in the vast rural areas and industrial and mining enterprises, and a rapid literacy method has been started to be promoted.

	Since the United States imperialists spread bacteria, the people of the entire region have organized a strong anti-bacterial warfare front and launched health education and mass patriotic health campaigns. As of the end of June, a total of 3.71 million tons of garbage and 9.67 million tons of feces had been cleared in the entire region; 10,597,700 rats had been caught, and indoor and outdoor cleaning work had been carried out universally. These struggles have improved the health of the people and guaranteed the progress of economic construction. In April this year, the wages of employees in Northeast China were adjusted. After the adjustment, the average wage of employees increased by 25.6 percent compared with the end of last year.

	On the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the Northeast State-owned Trade Companies reduced the list prices of more than 2,300 kinds of commodities since April. Among them, the average price of 601 kinds of department store products was reduced by 9.8 percent from mid-April, and the average price of 1,138 kinds of department store products was reduced by another 11.7 percent from mid-May; the average price of 136 kinds of local products was reduced by 19.5 percent. Other non-staple foods and vegetables are in sufficient supply and prices are stable. The decrease in prices has relatively increased the people's monetary purchasing power. From the sales volume of various major daily necessities of state-owned trade, it can be seen that there has been a significant increase in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, with the following percentages: cotton cloth 62.8, rice 242.8, flour 273.9, sugar 44.4, pork 398.2, eggs 210.4. Due to stable prices and increased wages, the lives of employees have been further improved. Currently, the working people of the entire region are striving to complete this year's national plan and increase production and save tasks.

    东北区一九五二年上半年
    人民经济计划执行情况公报摘要
    东北人民政府经济计划委员会日前发表东北区一九五二年上半年人民经济计划执行情况公报，摘要如下：一九五二年上半年，东北区的经济建设是在伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动中进行的，并在“三反”、“五反”运动胜利结束的基础上，热烈地开展了爱国增产节约运动。因此，胜利地完成了上半年计划，并大大超过了去年同期的水平。
    工业生产的增长和技术的改进
    今年上半年，国营公营工业的全体职工，发挥高度的劳动热情，大力推广先进经验，完成上半年生产计划百分之一零四点八，达到全年计划百分之五零点四，比去年同期增长百分之五七点六。其中，国营工业完成计划百分之一零六点八，比去年同期增长百分之五七点六。工业部的总产值完成上半年计划百分之一零五点四，比去年同期增长百分之五四点三。
    上半年，国营公营工业为满足日益发展的生产建设的需要，着重增产了各种主要生产资料。生产资料总产值完成上半年计划百分之一零五点九，比去年同期增长百分之六一点三。消费资料总产值完成上半年计划百分之一零三点三，比去年同期增长百分之五一点六。各主要产业部门一九五二年上半年与一九五一年上半年相比，增长的百分数如下：
    生产资料方面：电力二五点三；煤炭采掘三五；钢铁六九；机器及零件九六点八；化学品九五点四；建筑材料六四点四；森林采伐八三点九。
    消费资料方面：纺织品五八；纸张九七点五；文化艺术用品一八七点一；肥皂及化妆品一九五点七；火柴二零七点八。
    上半年，国营公营工业的全体职工，在增产节约运动中，找“窍门”、推广先进经验有了进一步的开展。一九五一年的各种“窍门”和先进经验，多为技术改进；一九五二年则在改进生产技术的基础上，有系统地推广了改进劳动组织、节约原材料与机械设备的检修等方面的先进经验，使工业生产水平的提高有了显著的成绩。
    在设备检修方面：电力工业推行快速检修法，使发电设备的检修时间缩短百分之三三至六四，线路检修时间缩短百分之五六点四；实行了统一配合检修，使生产设备的检修与动力的检修，有计划地进行，发电的设备利用率和企业的作业率都提高了。
    在改进劳动组织方面：机械工业推行按指示图组织有节奏的生产，改变了盲目突击和前松后紧的生产上的紊乱现象，其中取得效果最大的机械三厂，产量逐月提高，劳动生产率比去年同期提高百分之一四三。此外在采煤工业、电器工业及其他工业部门，均已开始推广按指示图组织生产办法。由于劳动组织的改进，使各种技术改进得到有组织的进行，因而提高了工业生产的水平。这是生产管理上的重大改革。纺织工业继续推行郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法，使棉纱每锭时产量比去年平均提高百分之一七点七，棉布每台时产量比去年平均提高百分之九。
    在节约原材料方面：仅利用劣煤发电，全年即可节省四十万吨好煤；橡胶各厂以再生胶代替生胶，并推行机械冷压成型法，下半年可节省全年生胶用量百分之八点三。
    先进经验的推广在地方工业中也收到了很大效果。由于李川江小组先进榨油法的推广，使大豆的出油率由今年定额百分之一零点五，提高到百分之一四点零四，平均出油率已达百分之十二，每十万吨大豆就多出一千五百吨油。这一先进经验已在普遍推广。其他如糠麸造酒，提高出酒率等先进经验都已得到推广。
    但是，国营公营工业中某些产品的质量低劣现象，仍很严重。特别是国营工业中的机械、造纸、肥皂、胶鞋类的部分产品，以及地方工业中的火柴、陶瓷等日用品的质量，均亟待改进。
    此外，机械工业的新产品试制未完成计划，电器类产品中不按品种规格进行生产的现象仍很普遍。因此，今后在推广先进经验中，应特别注意提高产品质量，严格执行品种计划和新产品试制计划。
    上半年，国营公营工业的全体职工，在完成国家计划的同时，并积极地响应了高岗主席所提出的增产节约八百万吨粮食财富的号召；经过广泛深入的讨论后，国营公营厂矿和基本建设单位的增产节约计划，已达一千三百五十四万吨粮食，现已开始行动，取得初步成绩。
    上半年，经过“五反”运动，国家经济对有利于国计民生的私营工业进行了扶持，因而私营工业也得到了发展。沈阳市上半年国家委托加工的总产值比去年同期增加了百分之六四点六，因此，全市私营工业比去年同期：总产值增加百分之八点六；户数增加百分之六点六；雇用工人数增加百分之二八点四。
    基本建设已提到首要地位
    一九五二年基本建设计划工作总量为去年百分之一百六十一。工业方面较去年增加百分之一百二十五，其中百分之三十属新企业的兴建，重工业的工作量占工业建设的百分之七十二点七。工业基本建设已提到经济建设的首要地位。
    一九五二年上半年各部局完成年计划工作量百分之二十二点四。各省市百亿以上建设单位完成年计划工作量百分之十三点八。
    电力站及煤矿建设，铁路、公路、邮电及水利建设，大都完成预定计划进度，有些工程已超额完成计划进度。
    由于设计、施工技术力量的不足，工程开工时期较晚，工程管理上未贯彻责任制度，计划进度虽较往年有进展，但仍是缓慢，而且各个建设部门的发展是不平衡的。工程质量还落后于技术要求，经过检查与严肃批判后，各个建设部门都发动工人想办法、找“窍门”，健全各项制度，工程质量不高的缺点，现已开始纠正，并将不断改进。
    在加强建设力量方面：通过计划的全面平衡，对施工组织进行过调整，扩大固定工人的数量与范围；在较大施工现场，施行部分机械化施工。按地区、工种统一调配基本建设劳动力。在组织地方建筑材料的生产与分配工作上，采取按地区产销结合的办法，视工期先后，由工程所在地计委会统一调度，保证材料及时供应。这些均为工程建设创造了有利条件。
    在学习与推广先进经验方面，亦获得很大成绩。如采用建筑结构新标准后，从设计中可节省土建投资百分之五以上。大力推行木、瓦等工种的流水作业法及新式工具，工作效率大大提高，特别是学习苏联的竖井平行作业、混凝土真空作业及快速钻探法等，对缩短工期起了巨大作用。工具改进与创造达三百余件，同时不断涌现出新的创造。但目前推广工作还不够普遍，各种保守思想须进一步克服，工地的政治工作尚待加强。
    农业生产及水利事业的发展
    今春全区播种面积只完成春播计划百分之九八点四，比去年增加百分之一点二。其中，粮食作物完成计划百分之一零零点六，比去年增加百分之二点八；工业原料作物播种面积未完成计划。全区播种面积（包括开荒）之所以未完成计划，主要是由于部分省、县对春耕未抓紧领导，同时部分地区遭受春旱，部分风沙地撩荒以及部分耕地改为造林地。
    今春全区施肥面积，已由去年占总播种面积百分之五八点九扩大到百分之六三点二（不包括夏季追肥数），许多先进农业生产合作社与互助组且已达到百分之百。主要粮食作物的优良种籽播种面积已达一百一十万垧，比去年增加百分之五二点九。
    上半年内共推广新式农具二万九千三百九十八件，完成计划百分之九七点四。由于在推广中加强了技术指导，新农具已在实际生产中起了良好作用，因而普遍受到群众欢迎。上半年供给农村硫安四万六千五百吨，豆饼四十八万吨（包括肥料与饲料），各种农药十四种达二千五百吨。同时在爱国增产运动的推动之下，夏锄中精耕细作，及时铲趟，大量追肥，已成为群众性的行动，这些都给提高单位面积产量造成了有利的条件。
    全区二十八个国营公营机械农场，播种面积共计八万六千九百垧，虽然翻地作业机械化已达百分之九六点八，播种作业机械化已达百分之九一点六，但由于机械效率未能充分发挥，劳动组织配合不好，只完成计划百分之七七点九。
    水利方面，已完成了查哈阳、梨树、盘山、郭前旗等四大灌溉区的春修工程，解决了盘山和郭前旗稻田的排水问题，并在抗旱防旱上起了一定作用。饶阳河东流的疏浚工程，羊肠河二龙湾的补堤工程和东沙河堤防改线工程亦均完工，可使四万垧农田不受水害。今春西部防护林带的营造共完成两万六千垧，超过春季计划百分之二三。加上各省市的造林，初步统计全区今春共造林八万八千垧，完成春季造林计划百分之一零二点八。
    交通运输事业的发展
    上半年，东北铁路货物运输吨数完成计划百分之九九点一，比去年同期增加百分之二五点一。各种主要物资有的已超过计划，有些接近完成计划。由于继续贯彻了煤、粮、木材、水泥的分区产销、合理运输，继续减少了相向运输与远程运输。今年东北铁路职工在去年下半年运输效率大大提高的基础上，继续改进工作，并于第二季度开展了满载超轴五百公里运动，获得了新的成绩。货车净载重平均已达二九点二吨，列车平均总重达一、二一七吨，机车日车公里平均达四四一点八公里，均超过计划。五百公里机车已占机车总数的百分之四三点五。公路货运吨数只完成计划百分之九二，但比去年同期增加百分之一零五点二。
    职工人数的增加与劳动生产
    率的提高
    今年上半年，由于经济建设的发展，各部门的职工人数显著增加。今年六月底全东北职工人数，比一九五一年底增加二十七万九千人；其中：国营公营工业增加九万九千二百人；基本建设部门增加五万八千七百人；农林部门增加三万六千八百人；交通运输部门增加一万六千四百人。
    今年上半年，经过伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动及开展爱国增产节约运动，全区工人阶级觉悟程度更加提高了，劳动热忱更为高涨了，由于先进经验的不断出现，工业方面的劳动生产率，比去年同期提高了百分之二零点九，其中：国营工业提高百分之二三点七。在国营工业中，工业部系统的劳动生产率完成上半年计划百分之一零三点七，比去年同期提高百分之二八点九。
    文教卫生事业的发展及人民
    物质生活的提高
    今年上半年各级学校及学生都有增加。高等学校增至三十四所，比去年同期增加百分之七八点九，学生比去年同期增加百分之三五点一；中等技术学校七十五所，学生数比去年同期增加百分之三八点五；中学和师范学校四百三十四所，学生二十七万五千六百八十名；初等学校三万六千五百所，学生五百零三万二千六百名。今年七月高等学校和技术学校将有九千六百七十名学生毕业。
    在上半年内发行各种书刊达四千七百余万册，比去年同期增加百分之三十。东北日报上半年每日平均发行二十六万三千三百九十份，比去年同期增加百分之三四点六。在广大乡村和工矿企业中展开了群众性的识字运动，并已开始推行速成识字法。
    自美帝国主义撒布细菌以来，全区人民已组织起坚强的反细菌战线，开展了卫生教育和群众性的爱国卫生运动。截至六月底，全区共清除垃圾三百七十一万吨，粪便九百六十七万吨；捕鼠一千零五十九万七千只，并普遍进行室内外的清扫工作。这些斗争增进了人民的健康，保证了经济建设的进行。今年四月份调整了东北职工工资。在调整后，职工平均工资比去年年底提高百分之二五点六。
    在“三反”、“五反”运动的胜利基础上，东北国营贸易各区公司自四月份开始，降低了二千三百余种商品的牌价。其中，百货类六百零一种商品自四月中旬起平均降低价格百分之九点八，五月中旬起百货类一千一百三十八种商品平均又降低价格百分之一一点七；一百三十六种土产品则平均降低价格百分之一九点五。其他副食品、菜蔬等，供应充分，价格平稳。物价的降低使人民的货币购买力相对提高。从国营贸易各种主要日用品的销售量上，可以看出今年上半年比去年同期有显著的增加，其百分数为：棉布六二点八，大米二四二点八，面粉二七三点九，砂糖四四点四，猪肉三九八点二，鸡蛋二一零点四。由于物价平稳，工资提高，职工生活已得到进一步的改善。现全区劳动人民正为完成今年国家计划及增产节约任务而奋斗。
