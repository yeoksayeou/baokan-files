Since the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Inspecting the Implementation of the Marriage Law" last September, most regions across the country have vigorously promoted the Marriage Law and achieved certain successes in the struggle against the feudal marriage system. However, since the spring of this year, some leaders at the prefectural and county levels have been busy with the "Three-Anti" campaign and spring agricultural production, relaxing or abandoning leadership over the implementation of the Marriage Law, and the phenomenon of women committing suicide or being killed due to marriage problems has re-emerged.

After the State Council's instructions were issued last year, the implementation of the Marriage Law formed a period of upsurge across the country. Provinces and some prefectures organized inspection teams on the implementation of the Marriage Law, focusing on in-depth inspections and publicity in specific areas, and holding public trials of typical cases, giving due punishment to those who killed women and interfered with freedom of marriage, expanding the Marriage Law's influence among cadres and the masses, and universally raising the attention of leaders at all levels to the implementation of the Marriage Law. Subsequently, many counties combined the Marriage Law's publicity with central tasks such as land reform, land reform review, democratic reform, and production campaigns. Counties gathered cadres from relevant departments and mass organizations, organized inspection teams or mobile trial teams to go deep into districts and townships, discover and solve problems, and widely and deeply publicized the Marriage Law using real people and events on the spot; this in-depth inspection and mobile trial method was welcomed by the broad masses and cadres. Some counties used various forms such as bulletins, plays, and local broadcasting to carry out publicity in districts and townships. In promoting the Marriage Law, all counties paid special attention to educating district and township cadres, holding meetings of district and township cadres to study the Marriage Law after public trials, and studying and discussing the Marriage Law in training classes for rural activists, at peasant representative conferences, and at women's representative conferences; some places also held meetings of people who violated the Marriage Law (but not seriously), using the method of denouncing the crimes of the feudal marriage system to raise everyone's awareness; some places held training classes for district marriage mediation personnel, overcoming the phenomenon of district authorities not paying attention to marriage mediation and registration work. After studying, district and township cadres criticized their own erroneous ideas, improved their understanding of the Marriage Law, and many promised to actively implement the Marriage Law in the future. Local judicial organs also conducted a review of marriage cases that had been handled in the past and cautiously corrected deviations. The work style of judicial cadres in handling marriage cases has also changed. They have shifted from the past emphasis on divorce conditions, delaying time, or perfunctory handling to a cautious and open approach, handling cases in a timely and patient manner, starting from the long-term interests of both men and women, trying their best to persuade them to divorce voluntarily if they really could not get along, and only making a judgment if they could not be persuaded, and not granting hasty divorces if they could reconcile. The masses said, "The judicial section handles problems with a bottom line, those who should divorce must divorce no matter what, and those who shouldn't divorce can still reconcile." Through vigorous publicity and due to the change in the work style of cadres in dealing with marriage issues, the masses have strengthened their understanding of the Marriage Law. The masses generally know that abusing and beating women is illegal, marriage must be voluntary for both men and women, widows have the freedom to remarry, and they also recognize the harm of early marriage and child brides. As a result, the phenomenon of women being killed or committing suicide has significantly decreased in some areas. For example, in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, seven marriage-related deaths occurred from January to October 1951. After universally and deeply publicizing the Marriage Law from October, there were no deaths due to divorce or marriage until the end of April this year. The struggle of young men and women against the feudal marriage system has been strengthened. According to the statistics of the North Sichuan People's Court from January to April this year, there were 5,419 marriage cases in the region, of which 4,980 were divorce cases, mostly filed by women due to forced arranged marriages by their parents, abuse by their husbands and parents-in-law, and cases of young men and old women. The number of marriage cases in these four months accounted for 80% of the total marriage cases in the region last year, and the number of divorce cases accounted for more than 87% of the total divorce cases in the region last year. Various regions have also seen the emergence of many model figures who actively struggle against the feudal marriage system and obtain freedom of marriage, as well as a large number of democratic and harmonious families. According to the statistics of Fuyang Prefecture in North Anhui, from January to the present, there are 3,065 widows who have remarried, 8,723 who have married freely, 95,376 democratic and harmonious families, and 2,414 couples who are in free love. Women have happily solved their marriage problems and are very active in politics, culture, and production. This spring in Fuyang Prefecture, North Anhui, under the slogan "Men govern the Huai River, women cultivate in spring, love the country and increase production, everyone participates," 1.28 million women participated in spring agricultural production. The number of women participating in production in each county accounts for 70% to 90% of the number of adult women. The women engage in labor with infinite joy, singing songs:
    "In the past, women didn't go to the fields,
    They were beaten and bullied,
    Now the world has changed,
    Chairman Mao leads and advocates equality.
    Organize and work hard,
    Deep plow and meticulous work to increase production,
    Resist America and aid Korea to support the front lines,
    We will not give up until we eliminate American imperialism."
    
However, the publicity of the Marriage Law in various regions is only regarded as a temporary task for a period of time and has not been implemented as a regular political task. Some regions still regard the implementation of the Marriage Law as being opposed to the central work, and some regions do not have a sufficient understanding of the implementation of the Marriage Law as a long-term anti-feudal struggle task, thinking that holding meetings and publicity is enough to implement the Marriage Law. The work of implementing the Marriage Law in various regions is characterized by being tight and loose at times, or even adopting an attitude of indifference and letting it develop on its own. Even fewer counties are indifferent to the State Council's instructions and have not paid attention to the publicity of the Marriage Law at all. Therefore, except for some advanced regions that have always attached importance to the implementation of the Marriage Law (such as Lushan County in Henan Province, Wuxiang County in Shanxi Province, and Lin County in Pingyuan Province), the publicity of the Marriage Law in general regions is not universal enough and not deep enough. This is the main reason why the phenomenon of women committing suicide or being killed due to improper handling of marriage issues has not only not been eliminated in various regions since the spring of this year, but has even developed in some regions. According to statistics from various regions, in the East China region, in the two months of April and May this year, in twelve prefectures, one city, and sixty-nine counties, 1,067 people committed suicide or were killed due to marriage problems (a small number of them were men); in Pingyuan Province, 84 people committed suicide or were killed due to marriage problems from January to April this year; in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, 42 women died due to marriage problems in the first half of this year, and the average monthly mortality rate increased more than twice compared to the previous year and a half.

The long-term traditional ideas of male superiority, patriarchal rule, and patriarchal system in the vast rural areas have been hit to a certain extent after a period of vigorous publicity, but have not been completely overthrown. The nature of the women's death cases mentioned above is mostly due to being abused, beaten to death, poisoned to death, or tortured to death by parents-in-law or husbands, or due to being insulted or illegally struggled against after fighting for marriage autonomy and committing suicide out of anger. Some district and township cadres often adopt a careless and perfunctory attitude when dealing with marriage issues, some are afraid of taking responsibility and push things to higher levels, and some even personally interfere with and suppress the masses' demands for freedom of marriage. For example, Chen Yulan, a woman in the second district of Huojia County, Pingyuan Province, was often abused by her husband Lu Qinglian. Chen Yulan had repeatedly filed for divorce with the district government, but was obstructed by village cadres because Lu Qinggui, the secretary of the village branch, was Lu Qinglian's own brother, so the village cadres forced mediation and did not allow divorce. The district government did not pay attention to this situation either. Later, Chen Yulan was finally hacked to death by Lu Qinglian with a kitchen knife. When Lu Qinglian closed the door and hacked Chen Yulan, the village branch secretary and village cadres did not dare to break the door to rescue her because they were afraid of taking responsibility, but ran to the district one by one to ask for instructions. Shang Fengtian, the secretary of the district party committee, was also extremely careless and thought that Lu Qinglian would not dare to kill anyone. It was not until the village came to ask for instructions for the fifth time that he began to move. By the time he arrived at the scene, Chen Yulan had been killed. Shang Fengtian did not even bother to take a look at the situation and left after staying on the main street of the village for a while. Wu Dazhen, a woman in the thirteenth district of Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, had incompatible feelings with her husband Hu Xianjing, and the two agreed to divorce. When handling the divorce procedures at the district government, the two sides had a dispute over property, and the deputy district chief Guo Zhaozhang slapped Wu Dazhen twice and threatened her: "You bad woman, you are not allowed to divorce!" Later, although she was allowed to divorce, she was only given a small portion of the property. Wu Dazhen suffered great humiliation and wanted to appeal, but the masses said: "The deputy district chief even beats people, where are you going to appeal?" This incident affected the women in the district, and they did not dare to seek support from the district government if they had something to do. They had no place to complain about their grievances and could not express their sufferings. They felt that life was painful and took their lives passively. In the month of April alone, seven women in the district committed suicide one after another due to dissatisfaction with their marriages. Because various regions have relaxed or abandoned their leadership over the implementation of the Marriage Law, and district and township cadres who violated the Marriage Law have not been dealt with in a timely manner, the breeding of feudal remnants has been promoted. Some people with serious feudal ideas spread rumors saying: "The government is not implementing the Marriage Law!" The phenomenon of backlog of cases in judicial organs in various regions during the "Three-Anti" movement is also very serious. For example, Pingyuan Province has a backlog of 2,500 marriage cases, and criminals who mutilate and kill women cannot be punished in a timely manner, which also hinders the implementation of the Marriage Law.

Since June, the Communist Party committees and people's governments at all levels have paid attention to the phenomenon of women being killed or committing suicide. The counties in Fuyang Prefecture, North Anhui, convened women's representative meetings under the unified leadership of the county party committees to handle cases and publicize the Marriage Law. The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government issued instructions to clear up the backlog of cases, requiring all regions to quickly handle marriage cases and expand the publicity of the Marriage Law through specific cases. Whether the leaders at the prefectural and county levels attach importance to the work of implementing the Marriage Law, whether they can regularly conduct publicity and education on the Marriage Law to the masses and district and township cadres in conjunction with the central work, whether they mobilize cadres from relevant departments to work together to implement the Marriage Law, and whether they handle marriage cases in a timely manner are key issues for whether the Marriage Law can be implemented in various regions, and are also urgent issues that need to be resolved at present.

### 今年上半年各地执行婚姻法情况

    今年上半年各地执行婚姻法情况
    去年九月中央人民政府政务院发布“关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示”后，全国大部分地区都曾大张旗鼓地宣传了婚姻法，在反对封建婚姻制度的斗争中取得了一定的成绩。但自今年春季以来，有些专区和县一级的领导者忙于“三反”和春耕生产运动，放松或放弃了对贯彻婚姻法的领导，妇女因婚姻问题自杀被杀现象又有发展。
    去年政务院指示发布以后，贯彻执行婚姻法在全国各地形成了一个时期的热潮。各省和部分专区都组织了婚姻法执行情况检查组，有重点地深入一地进行检查和宣传，并抓住典型案件举行公审大会，给杀害妇女和干涉婚姻自由的人犯以应有的惩罚，扩大了婚姻法在干部和群众中的影响，普遍地引起了各级领导上对贯彻婚姻法的重视。接着很多的县都结合土地改革、土地改革复查、民主改革和生产运动等中心工作宣传了婚姻法。各县集合了各有关部门和群众团体的干部，组织检查组或巡回审判小组深入区乡，发现问题，解决问题，以真人真事就地取材的方法广泛深入地宣传了婚姻法；这种深入检查和巡回审判的办法得到了广大群众和干部的欢迎。有些县利用通报、演剧和土广播等各种形式在区乡中进行宣传。各县在宣传婚姻法中特别注意了对区乡干部进行教育，在举行公审会后召开区乡干部会议学习婚姻法，在乡村积极分子训练班上、在农民代表会和妇女代表会上学习和讨论了婚姻法；有些地方还召开了违反婚姻法人员（不是严重错误的）会议，用控诉封建婚姻制度罪恶的方法提高大家的觉悟；有些地方举办区婚姻调解人员训练班，克服了区上对婚姻调解和登记工作不重视的现象。区乡干部经过学习后都批判了自己的错误思想，对婚姻法的认识有了提高，很多人保证以后要积极执行婚姻法。各地司法机关也对过去已处理的婚姻案件都作了一次检查，并慎重地纠正了偏向。司法干部处理婚姻案件的作风也有了转变。他们由过去的强调离婚条件，拖延时间或一判了事的粗枝大叶的作风转变为谨慎放手，及时耐心处理，从男女双方长远利益出发，对于真正合不来的，尽量说服自愿离婚，实在说不服的才下判决，能够和好的也不给予草率离婚。群众说：“司法科处理问题有了底，该离的说啥也得离，不该离的还能和好。”经过大张旗鼓的宣传和由于干部对待婚姻问题作风的转变，群众加强了对婚姻法的认识。群众较普遍地知道了虐待打骂妇女是犯法的，婚姻必须男女双方自愿，寡妇再嫁自由，也认识到早婚和童养媳的害处。因而有些地区妇女被杀自杀现象显著减少，如平原省林县一九五一年一至十月因婚姻死亡案发生七起，十月开始普遍深入宣传婚姻法后，到今年四月底，就没有发生因离婚结婚死亡案件。青年男女反对封建婚姻制度的斗争加强了。据川北人民法院今年一月到四月的统计，全区婚姻案件有五四一九件，其中离婚案四九八○件，多半是妇女因父母强迫包办，丈夫和公婆虐待和男小女大等原因提出的。这四个月的婚姻案件的数字竟占去年一年全区婚姻案件的百分之八十，而离婚案件占去年一年全区离婚案件百分之八十七以上。各地并涌现出不少和封建婚姻制度积极斗争而得到婚姻自由的模范人物和大量的民主和睦家庭。据皖北阜阳专区的统计，自今年一月到现在的统计，全专区寡妇改嫁的有三千零六十五人，自由结婚的有八千七百二十三人，民主和睦家庭有九万五千三百七十六个，自由恋爱的有二千四百十四对。妇女们美满地解决了婚姻问题，在政治、文化、生产各方面都显得非常活跃。皖北阜阳专区今年春季在“男人治淮，女人春耕，爱国增产，人人有份”的口号下，有一百二十八万妇女参加了春耕生产。各县妇女参加生产人数占成年妇女人数百分之七十到九十。妇女们以无限欢乐的心情从事劳动，高唱着歌：
    “过去的妇女不下地，
    光挨打，光受气，
    如今世道变了天，
    毛主席领导讲平权。
    组织起来加油干，
    深耕细作多增产，
    抗美援朝支前线，
    不消灭美帝心不甘。”
    但是各地宣传婚姻法，只作为一个时期的临时任务，没有把它作为经常的政治任务来贯彻执行。有些地区仍然把贯彻婚姻法看做是和中心工作对立的，有些地区对贯彻婚姻法是一个长期的反封建斗争任务认识不足，认为开过了会，宣传过了，就算是贯彻了婚姻法。各地在贯彻婚姻法的工作上表现为时紧时松，或者竟采取了不闻不问任其发展的态度。更有少数县份对政务院的指示无动于衷，根本没有注意过宣传婚姻法。因此，除了一贯重视贯彻婚姻法的某些先进地区（例如河南省鲁山县、山西省武乡县和平原省林县等）外，一般地区对婚姻法的宣传还不够普遍、不够深入。这就是各地从今年春季以来因婚姻问题处理不当而引起妇女自杀被杀现象不但没有消灭，甚至有些地区还在发展的主要原因。根据各地统计，华东区在今年四五两个月中，在十二个专区、一个市和六十九个县中，因婚姻问题自杀被杀的有一千零六十七人（其中有少数是男的）；平原省今年一月到四月因婚姻问题自杀被杀的有八十四人；湖南省湘阴县今年上半年妇女因婚姻问题死四十二人，每月平均死亡率比以往一年半增加二倍以上。
    广大农村中长期传统的男尊女卑、夫权统治和家长制度思想经过一阵大张旗鼓的宣传后，虽然受到了一定程度的打击，但还没有完全被打倒。上面所举妇女死亡案件的性质极大部分是属于被公婆、丈夫虐待活活打死毒死或折磨自杀而死，或是因争取婚姻自主被侮辱、被非法斗争后气愤自杀而死。部分区乡干部在处理婚姻问题时往往采取不关心的轻率敷衍的态度，有的怕负责任，遇事就往上级推，有的甚至亲自干涉和压制群众对婚姻自由的要求。如平原省获嘉县二区妇女陈玉兰经常受丈夫卢清连虐待，陈玉兰曾几次向区政府提出离婚，都受到村干部的阻挠，因为村支部书记卢清桂是卢清连的亲兄弟，所以村干部给以强制调解，不准离婚。而区政府对这种情况也不加注意。后来陈玉兰终于被卢清连用菜刀劈杀。当卢清连闭门劈杀陈玉兰时，该村支部书记和村干部等又因怕负责任竟不敢破门抢救，却一个个跑到区上去请示。区委书记尚风田也极其麻痹大意，认为卢清连不敢杀人，直到村里第五次来人请示时，才开始动身。等他到出事地点时，陈玉兰已被杀死。尚风田也不去看个究竟，只在该村大街上逗留了一下就走了。湖南省湘阴县十三区妇女吴大珍和丈夫胡先敬感情不合，两人同意离婚。在区政府办离婚手续时，双方因为财产问题发生争执，副区长郭兆璋竟把吴大珍打了两个耳光，威胁她：“你这坏妇女，不准离婚！”后来虽然准许她离了婚，但只分给她很少一部分财产。吴大珍受了莫大屈辱，想上诉，群众说：“副区长还打人，你上诉到那里去呢？”这件事影响该区妇女群众有事都不敢找区政府支持。她们有冤无处诉，有苦不能申，觉得活着痛苦，就消极轻生。在四月份一个月内该区妇女因婚姻不满而相继自杀者有七人之多。各地因为放松或放弃了对贯彻婚姻法的领导，对违反婚姻法的区乡干部都没有及时处理，因而助长了封建残余势力的滋生。有些有严重封建思想的人造谣说：“政府不贯彻婚姻法啦！”各地司法机关在“三反”运动中积案现象也很严重，如平原省积压婚姻案件达二千五百件，致残杀妇女的罪犯不能得到及时的惩办，也阻碍了婚姻法的贯彻。
    从六月份开始，各级中共党委和人民政府对妇女被杀自杀现象已引起重视。皖北阜阳专区各县在县委统一领导下召开了妇女代表会议，处理案件，宣传婚姻法。平原省人民政府发出了清理积案的指示，要求各地迅速处理婚姻案件，并通过具体案件扩大宣传婚姻法。专区和县一级的领导者是否重视贯彻婚姻法的工作，是否能够结合中心工作经常地向群众和区乡干部进行婚姻法的宣传教育，是否发动有关部门的干部一起来做贯彻婚姻法的工作和及时处理婚姻案件是各地婚姻法能否贯彻的关键问题，也是目前迫切需要解决的问题。（新华社）
