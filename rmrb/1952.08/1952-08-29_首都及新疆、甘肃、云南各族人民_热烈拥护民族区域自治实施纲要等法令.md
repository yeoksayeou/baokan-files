Xinhua News Agency Report: The people of all ethnic groups in the capital, Xinjiang Province, Gansu Province, and Yunnan Province warmly support the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" and related laws and decrees promulgated by the Central People's Government. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau convened a symposium on August 23 to discuss the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" and related laws and decrees recently promulgated by the Central People's Government. More than 30 representatives of ethnic minorities residing in the capital, including the Hui, Manchu, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uyghur ethnic groups, attended the meeting. In their speeches, the representatives of all ethnic groups unanimously expressed their warm support for this series of measures by the Central People's Government. Hui representative Ma Yu and Manchu representative Lian Kuoru said: We are very happy to see the Central People's Government promulgate four decisions on ethnic issues. This is an unprecedented and wise measure for ethnic issues in Chinese history. Mongolian representative Wu Fei, based on his personal experience, explained the happiness that the establishment of national autonomous governments brings to ethnic minorities. Uyghur representative Reyimu and others also expressed their intention to use various occasions to publicize the decisions of the Central People's Government to the people of all ethnic groups.

After the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" was published in both the Chinese and Uyghur versions of the *Xinjiang Daily* in Dihua, it was warmly supported by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. People rushed to buy the *Xinjiang Daily* that published this outline and related documents. Tohti Rouzi and Musa Qiu A (Uyghur), farmer representatives from Aksu and Shache Prefectures who attended the first Xinjiang Provincial Conference of Farmers and Herdsmen, said: After liberation, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to turn over, and people of all ethnic groups have united. Now they are further allowing us to establish autonomous governments and enshrining this right into national laws and regulations, all for our benefit. Uyghur, Kazakh, Tatar, Solon, and other ethnic students from the Department of Biochemistry of Xinjiang Provincial Nationalities Institute immediately launched a discussion after seeing this outline. One hundred and eighty-four reading groups of the Cadre School of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, including students of all thirteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang, have designated these important documents as the focus of their current study.

On August 20, more than 60 representatives of the Hui, Han, Tibetan, Dongxiang, Salar, Uyghur, and other ethnic groups in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, gathered to discuss the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" and related laws and decrees. The representatives all expressed their gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for their care for the people of ethnic minorities. Ma Hongbin (Hui), Director of the Nationalities Affairs Committee of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, said: Under the leadership of the Communist Party, Gansu Province has made great achievements in implementing national regional autonomy in ethnic minority areas. Now Chairman Mao has promulgated the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China," which we not only firmly support but also strive to achieve thoroughly. The Dongxiang Autonomous Region People's Government of Gansu Province convened a symposium of Dongxiang ethnic democrats and working cadres on August 19 to celebrate the promulgation of the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy. Ma Shaowen (Dongxiang), Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, and others shared their personal experiences at the meeting to illustrate the benefits of implementing national regional autonomy. The Tibetan people living in Xiahe County, Gansu Province, also warmly congratulated the promulgation of the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy. Living Buddha Amang Cang (Tibetan) of Labrang Monastery said: In the future, we should unite more closely with other fraternal ethnic groups and strive to build our motherland and a prosperous Tibetan area. Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), head of the Gannan Tibetan Area Visiting Group of the Northwest Military and Political Committee who is visiting Xiahe, and Ma Peiqing (Hui), deputy head of the first sub-group of the group, both made speeches, expressing their willingness to assist in the implementation of national regional autonomy with practical actions.

After the promulgation of the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" and related ethnic laws, the students of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Nationalities Institute excitedly conducted studies or discussions. Han Fuyou (Dai), Sha Liquan (Hui), members of the National Democratic United Government of Baoshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province, and Pai Zao San (Shantou), member of the National Democratic United Government of Ruili County, were very excited after seeing these laws and documents. Pai Zao San said: The People's Government helped our Shantou people move from the mountains to the plains to settle down and produce. Now the higher-level government has sent a working team to our border area to help us prepare for the establishment of regional autonomy. Chairman Mao's laws and decrees are truly words and deeds. When the newspapers carrying the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy and related documents were circulated to Puer Prefecture in southern Yunnan, people of all ethnic groups competed to read them. The people of all ethnic groups in the Lisu Autonomous Region of Bijiang County, Yunnan Province, the Yi Autonomous Region of Eshan County, and the counties of Wenshan and Yuanyang, where national democratic united governments have been established, also warmly celebrated the promulgation of the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy.
