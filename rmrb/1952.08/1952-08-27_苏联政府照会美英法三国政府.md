Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 24th: TASS reported that on July 10th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs received notes from the United States, British, and French governments responding to the Soviet government's note of May 24, 1952, regarding a peace treaty with Germany.

On August 23rd, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky handed the Soviet government's reply to the French, American, and British ambassadors.

The full text of the U.S. government's note of July 10, 1952, and the Soviet government's reply of August 23, 1952, are as follows:

United States Government Note of July 10, 1952

The Ambassador of the United States of America presents his compliments to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and, upon instructions from his Government, has the honor to communicate the following:

(1) The United States Government, in its note of May 13, put forward various suggestions with the hope of promoting four-power talks in order to unify Germany and negotiate a peace treaty with an all-German government. The United States Government notes with regret that the Soviet Government, in its note of May 24, did not reply to these suggestions. The United States Government fully adheres to the views and suggestions it put forward in its note of May 13. Therefore, in the present note, it wishes primarily to focus on the current practical problem of the procedure for establishing an all-German government through free elections, with which it can negotiate a treaty.

(2) The Soviet Government, in its note, again suggested that the three issues of a peace treaty, the unification of Germany, and the establishment of an all-German government be discussed simultaneously. The United States Government continues to adhere to its original position on this issue, which is that the all-German government must participate in the negotiations of the treaty, and therefore Germany must first be unified and an all-German government established before such negotiations can take place. The unification of Germany can only be achieved through free elections. The first necessary step is clearly to determine whether the conditions necessary for holding such free elections currently exist. The second step is to hold the elections.

(3) Regarding the first step, the United States Government suggested in its note of May 13 that an impartial investigating commission determine whether the conditions necessary for holding free elections exist throughout Germany. Although the United States Government pointed out the great benefits of using a United Nations commission, it nevertheless expressed its willingness to consider any suggestions the Soviet Government might propose regarding an impartial investigating commission. The Soviet Government has not put forward such suggestions, but is limited to maintaining its proposal that a investigating commission be appointed by four-power agreement to conduct this investigation. The United States Government does not understand whether the Soviet Government believes that the investigating commission should be composed of four-power representatives, or merely that the composition of the investigating commission should be agreed upon by the four powers. The United States Government would like to receive clarification on this point. The United States Government continues to believe that a investigating commission composed entirely of nationals of the four powers cannot make useful decisions because it can only reflect the current differences of opinion among the four powers regarding the existing conditions in the Federal Republic, the Soviet occupation zone, and Berlin. The United States Government believes that if the investigating commission is to work effectively, it should be composed of impartial members, not be subject to vetoes or four-power control, and should have the right to freely go to all parts of Germany to investigate the conditions relevant to the possibility of holding free elections.

(4) As for the second step, the United States Government also suggested that, as soon as the investigating commission submits its report, representatives of the governments of the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom should immediately hold a meeting to discuss the issue of holding free elections throughout Germany at an early date, including the issue of creating appropriate conditions where necessary. The United States Government continues to adhere to this suggestion, to which the Soviet Government has not yet responded. The United States Government reiterates what it said in Section VIII of its note of May 13: "Such free elections can only be held when the necessary conditions exist in all parts of Germany, and when these conditions are maintained not only on the day of the vote and before the vote, but also after the vote."

(5) The United States Government further suggested that this meeting study the guarantees provided by the four governments that the all-German government established through free elections will have the necessary freedom of action in the period before the peace treaty comes into effect. The United States Government believes that the only specific suggestion made by the Soviet Government is that the all-German government must abide by the Potsdam decisions. This would mean restoring the four-power control system, which, according to the original plan, only applied to the "initial period of control." This approach would revive a control system that has proven unworkable, and, moreover, it would disregard the evolution of the entire situation in Germany in recent years. A German government under such control would, in its relations with the four powers, have virtually no freedom, and would not be able to freely negotiate a treaty with the aforementioned four governments.

(6) The United States Government also notes with concern that, although the Soviet Government has repeatedly stated in its note its hope for German unification, it has recently taken a series of measures in the Soviet occupation zone and Berlin without any reason, attempting to sever all ties between Germans in the Soviet occupation zone and the 50 million Germans in the Federal Republic and the Western sectors of Berlin. These measures have deepened the artificial division of Germany. The United States Government wishes to emphasize that the recent agreements signed with the Federal Republic enable Germany to unite widely and freely with other European countries. As the United States Government emphasized in its note of May 13, as a free and equal country, Germany has the fundamental right to unite with other countries for peaceful purposes. The United States Government cannot tolerate depriving it of this right. In addition, these agreements reaffirm the determination of the three powers and the Federal Republic to promote the unification of Germany, and clearly express that the three powers retain the right to conclude a treaty, which should be a treaty with the whole of Germany, and should be freely negotiated by the four powers and the all-German government.

(7) In order to avoid further delays, the United States Government, together with the French Government and the United Kingdom Government, after consulting with the German Federal Government and the German authorities in Berlin, unanimously suggest that if the four governments agree to hold free elections throughout Germany in accordance with the procedure discussed in Section IV of this note, and agree to allow the free German government to participate in the negotiations of the peace treaty with Germany, a meeting of representatives of the four powers should be held at an early date. The purpose of such a meeting is to reach agreement on the first issue, because in order to make greater progress, it is necessary to first resolve the issue of the selection and powers of the investigating commission responsible for determining whether the conditions necessary for free elections exist in Germany. The United States Government suggests that the four-power representatives discuss the following matters:

A. The issue of the selection of the investigating commission, in order to ensure the impartiality of the investigating commission; B. The issue of the powers of the investigating commission, in order to ensure that it can make recommendations to the four powers completely independently; C. The issue of the investigating commission's power to conduct investigations completely freely and without interference.

(8) In order for free elections to be held, it is also necessary to reach agreement on the plan for establishing an all-German government, in accordance with the suggestion in Section XI (4) of the United States Government's note of May 13. Therefore, the United States Government reiterates this suggestion for the four-power representatives to refer to when discussing these more important issues. After this agreement is reached, it will be possible to proceed to unify Germany.

(9) In view of the fact that the Soviet Government has repeatedly stated that it would prefer to hold a meeting at an early date rather than continue exchanging notes in this way, the United States Government is confident that this suggestion will meet the Soviet Government's intentions.

Soviet Government Note of August 23, 1952

In view of the U.S. Government's note of July 10th of this year, the Soviet Government deems it necessary to make the following statement:

1. The Soviet Government, in its note of May 24th and previous notes, has suggested to the U.S. Government, as well as the British and French governments, that it immediately commence direct negotiations regarding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of an all-German government. In order to facilitate the resolution of these issues, the Soviet Government, as early as March 10th, put forward a draft of the principles of a peace treaty with Germany for the joint consideration of the four governments—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—and also expressed its willingness to discuss other suggestions that might be put forward regarding this issue. However, it is a matter of record that the U.S. Government, as well as the British and French governments, have evaded direct negotiations with the Soviet Government on the aforementioned issues.

The U.S. Government's note of July 10th proves that the three governments, to this day, continue to delay discussion of important issues such as restoring German unity and concluding a peace treaty with Germany. 2. While the U.S., British, and French governments have been exchanging notes with the Soviet Government on the German issue for a long time, they have concluded a treaty with the Adenauer government. In flagrant violation of the Potsdam Agreement, the three governments separately concluded a so-called "agreement" with the Bonn government on May 26, calling it an agreement regarding the relations between the Western three powers and the Federal Republic of Germany. After this, another "agreement" on the so-called "European Defense Community" was signed in Paris on May 27. The governments signing these "agreements" have once again proven that they are not at all interested in unifying Germany or concluding a peace treaty with Germany, but are pursuing the aim of consolidating and deepening the division of Germany, incorporating West Germany and the West German army, which the Western three governments are organizing, into the North Atlantic bloc, and making fuller use of West Germany to achieve the aggressive aims of this bloc.

The separate Bonn "Agreement" concluded by the United States, Britain, and France with the Adenauer government is an open military alliance with clear aggressive intentions. This "agreement" puts a legal cloak on the revival of German militarism and the establishment of West German mercenaries led by fascist Hitler generals. We put the word "agreement" in quotation marks because this one-sided Bonn "Agreement" was not freely accepted by the West German people; it was imposed on West Germany against the will of the German people.

The three governments are doing everything possible to conceal from the German people the nature of this one-sided Bonn "Agreement," which is hostile to the national interests of Germany and harmful to the cause of peace. They are trying to make people believe that this "agreement" gives Germany the opportunity to "unite widely and freely with other European countries," and they are trying to make people believe that the U.S., British, and French governments are supposedly working to achieve the establishment of an all-German government that, they say, should enjoy the freedom of action and powers necessary for a government. However, the content of the separate Bonn "Agreement" contradicts these guarantees at every turn. From the content of the separate Bonn "Agreement," it can be seen that the Western three governments, using Germany's special international status as an excuse, have retained their so-called "special rights" intact. According to these "special rights," the U.S., British, and French governments can freely station troops on West German territory, and can freely declare a state of emergency in West Germany whenever they please, taking all power into their own hands. The U.S. Government, as well as the British and French governments, have, under this "agreement," obtained extensive rights to interfere in West German internal affairs, and can even use the occupying forces to force West Germany to obey their will.

All this shows that the separate Bonn "Agreement" not only does not open up the possibility of free development for Germany in the future, as the U.S. Government said in its note of July 10, but eliminates such a possibility, making West Germany, as under the occupation statutes, completely subordinate to and dependent on the occupying authorities.

3. The U.S. Government evades direct negotiations on the establishment of an all-German government and the conclusion of a peace treaty, and, in order to conceal this attitude, it put forward the issue of guarantees in its note of July 10, saying that the four countries should provide guarantees that the all-German government established through free elections will have the necessary freedom of action in the period before the peace treaty comes into effect.

However, as long as the separate Bonn "Agreement" exists, there can be no "freedom of action" for any all-German government. Article 7 of the "agreement" clearly stipulates that the possibility of establishing a unified Germany depends on the Western three governments retaining all the privileges stipulated in the Bonn "Agreement," which deprive Germany of its national sovereignty and independence.

It is quite clear that the U.S. Government, as well as the British and French governments, signed the separate Bonn "Agreement" not to unify Germany, form an all-German government, and give the all-German government genuine freedom of action. The U.S. Government's proposal in its note of July 10 regarding guaranteeing the "freedom of action" of the future all-German government is a pretext, the purpose of which is to conceal the Western three governments' attempt to make Germany compliant to their aggressive purposes.

In view of the U.S. Government's proposal in its note of July 10 regarding the issue of guaranteeing the free activity of the all-German government—an issue directly related to the powers of the all-German government—the Soviet Government deems it necessary to remind that the Soviet Government has explained its attitude on this issue in detail in its note of May 24. The note stated: "As for the all-German government and its powers, it goes without saying that this government must also abide by the decisions of Potsdam, and, after the conclusion of the peace treaty, it must abide by the terms of the treaty, which must help promote lasting peace in Europe." This is directly based on the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulates the principles on which the establishment of Germany—a peaceful, democratic, independent, unified Germany—should be based. All the activities of the U.S. Government in West Germany are clearly contrary to these principles.

In view of this, the Soviet Government believes it must point out that the U.S. Government distorts the meaning of the Soviet Government's reference to the Potsdam decisions in its note of May 24, insisting that this note intends to "restore the four-power control system," although in fact the Soviet Government's note of May 24 did not mention restoring the four-power control system, but only pointed out the necessity of abiding by the principles of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the re-establishment of a unified, independent, peace-loving, and democratic Germany.

4. The U.S. Government, in its note of July 10, again raised the issue of the right of the German people to "unite with other countries for peaceful purposes" and conclude corresponding agreements. On this issue, the Soviet Government has already mentioned in its note of April 9 a clause in the Soviet draft of the principles of a peace treaty with Germany, which stipulates that Germany has the obligation "not to participate in any group or military alliance aimed at opposing any country that participated in the war against Germany with its own troops." It is very clear that such a clause does not affect Germany's right to unite with other countries for peaceful purposes in any way. However, such a clause prevents Germany from participating in groups like the North Atlantic bloc, which have aggressive purposes and engage in activities that create the danger of another world war. The Soviet Government continues to believe that such a clause does not impermissibly restrict Germany's sovereignty, that this clause conforms to the four-power agreement on the German issue, that it is completely in the interests of all of Germany's neighbors, and that it is equally in Germany's own national interests.

5. The U.S. Government, in its note of July 10, mentioned the measures currently being taken by the German Democratic Republic to consolidate its own security, insisting that these measures "deepen the artificial division of Germany," and that its purpose is to sever the ties between Germans residing in the territory of the German Democratic Republic and those residing in West Germany.

Such a statement has absolutely no basis. It is well known that the government of the German Democratic Republic has widely explained that the above-mentioned measures were taken at the request of the people because West Germany sent many spies, saboteurs, terrorists, and smugglers for provocative purposes, causing losses to the people. This activity is directly related to the policy of rearmament and participation of West Germany in preparations for a new war that is being pursued.

6. In response to the Soviet Government's suggestion in its note of May 24 regarding immediately convening a meeting to jointly study the peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of an all-German government, the U.S. Government declared that it is impossible to draft a peace treaty with Germany before an all-German government is established, and therefore this issue should currently be limited to a investigating commission on the German issue. However, this statement is not consistent with the Potsdam Agreement. The agreement entrusts the Council of Foreign Ministers with "preparing a peace settlement for Germany, to be accepted by the German government when a government adequate for the purpose is established."

The Soviet Government believes that the U.S. Government, as well as the British and French governments, have absolutely no reason to refuse to draft a peace treaty with Germany before an all-German government is established. It is incorrect and absolutely unreasonable to postpone indefinitely the discussion of such major issues as the peace treaty with Germany and the restoration of German unity, as the U.S., British, and French governments suggest.

It is clear to everyone that the intention of the U.S. Government's suggestion is to continue to postpone indefinitely the discussion of the peace treaty with Germany and the restoration of German unity, that is, to keep the occupying forces stationed in Germany indefinitely.

7. Regarding the issue of the composition of the investigating commission to investigate the conditions for holding free general elections in Germany at present, the Soviet Government has explained its attitude in its notes of April 9 and May 24.

The U.S. Government talks about the benefits of an international investigating commission conducting an investigation of the current situation in Germany. However, suggesting the establishment of an international investigating commission on the German issue is turning Germany into an object of investigation, and such a suggestion can only be regarded as an insult to the German nation. The proposer of such a suggestion must have forgotten that Germany has had a parliamentary system for more than a century, regularly holds general elections, and has organized political parties; therefore, this requirement, which is usually made to backward countries, should not be made to Germany.

As for the question of who should make up the investigating commission to investigate whether Germany has the conditions for holding free all-German elections, we believe that the most objective investigating commission would be one selected by the Germans themselves from among the Germans—for example, representatives of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the Bundestag of West Germany—through four-power agreement. Such an investigating commission would neither insult the Germans nor be the first step towards German unification.

When discussing the investigation in Germany to determine whether Germany has the conditions for holding free all-German elections, we believe that it is first necessary to examine the implementation of some of the decisions of the Potsdam Conference, the implementation of which is a necessary prerequisite for holding truly free all-German elections and establishing an all-German government that expresses the will of the German people. These decisions of the Potsdam Conference include: the decision to eliminate German militarism, in order to, as the Potsdam Agreement says, "prevent for all time the resurgence and reorganization of German militarism and Nazism" and ensure that "Germany never again threatens its neighbors or the peace of the world"; the decision to implement the political principles towards Germany announced at the Potsdam Conference, which stipulate: "to destroy the National Socialist Party and its affiliated and supervised organizations, to disband all Nazi organizations, and to ensure that these organizations are not revived in any form, and all Nazi militarist actions and propaganda must be stopped." Among these principles of the Potsdam Conference is a provision that:

"Preparations must be made for the political life of Germany to be re-established on a democratic basis, and for Germany to participate in peaceful cooperation in international life in the future."

8. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have suggested convening a meeting of representatives of the four governments to discuss only the issues of the composition, duties, and powers of the investigating commission to investigate whether the conditions necessary for holding free elections exist in Germany.

It can be said that the exchange of views on this issue has brought the opinions of the Soviet government somewhat closer to those of the U.S., British, and French governments. However, the Soviet Government sees no reason to limit the scope of discussion of the four-power representative meeting to the issue of the above-mentioned investigating commission. The U.S. Government, as well as the British and French governments, are limiting the scope of the issues discussed by the above-mentioned four-power representatives and avoiding the study of major issues related to Germany, which makes it seem as if they are desperately trying to ensure that the four-power representative meeting achieves nothing or has no results at all. However, the Soviet Government remains ready to discuss the issues raised by the three governments regarding the investigating commission to investigate the conditions for holding free all-German elections at the four-power meeting. However, the Soviet Government also believes that it cannot and will never allow the meeting to be limited to the study of this one issue. The Soviet Government believes that this meeting must first discuss important issues such as the peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of an all-German government.

Based on the above views, the Soviet Government suggests convening a meeting of representatives of the four powers in the near future, in any case within October of this year, to discuss the following agenda:

A. The issue of preparing a peace treaty with Germany;

B. The issue of establishing an all-German government;

C. The issue of holding free all-German elections and establishing a investigating commission to investigate the conditions for holding such elections in Germany, as well as the composition, duties, and powers of this commission. In addition, the Soviet Government suggests that this four-power meeting also discuss the date of the withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany. The Soviet Government also suggests inviting representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the meeting when studying the corresponding issues. The Soviet Government is also sending the same note to the British and French governments.

    苏联政府照会美英法三国政府
    建议今年十月举行四国代表会议，讨论准备对德和约、成立全德政府、举行全德自由选举和撤退占领军等问题
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：七月十日，苏联外交部收到了答复苏联政府一九五二年五月二十四日关于对德和约照会的美国、英国和法国政府的照会。
    八月二十三日，苏联外交部长维辛斯基把苏联政府的复文交给了法国、美国和英国大使。
    美国政府一九五二年七月十日的照会以及苏联政府一九五二年八月二十三日的复文全文如下：
    美国政府一九五二年七月十日的照会
    美利坚合众国大使谨向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部长致意，并奉本国政府的命令，转达下列事项：
    （一）美国政府在五月十三日的照会中提出了各种建议，希望促成四国会谈以便统一德国，并与全德政府谈判对德和约。美国政府很遗憾地注意到，苏联政府在五月二十四日的照会中并未答复这些建议。美国政府完全坚持它在五月十三日的照会中所提出的见解和建议。因此，在目前的照会里它主要地想集中谈谈经由自由选举成立全德政府的程序这一当前实际问题，成立了这个政府，便可以与之谈判和约。
    （二）苏联政府在它的照会里，再次建议对和约、统一德国以及成立全德政府三个问题同时加以讨论。美国政府方面仍然坚持它对这问题的原来的态度，就是说，必须有全德政府参加和约的谈判，因此在进行这种谈判之前，德国首先必须加以统一，并建立一个全德国的政府。德国的统一只有通过自由选举才能实现。第一个必要的步骤显然就是决定目前是否存在着举行这种自由选举所必需的条件。第二个步骤便是举行选举。
    （三）关于第一个步骤，美国政府在五月十三日的照会中建议，由一个公正的调查团决定在全德国是否存在着举行自由选举所必需的条件。美国政府虽然指出利用联合国委员会有很大的好处，然而仍表示愿意考虑苏联政府可能提出的任何关于公正调查团的建议。苏联政府没有提出这种建议，而只限于保持它所提出的由四国协议任命一个调查团来进行这种调查的主张。美国政府不明了苏联政府究竟认为调查团应由四国代表组成呢，还是仅仅认为调查团的组成应由四国商定，美国政府愿意得到关于这一点的阐释。美国政府仍然相信：完全由四国国民组成的调查团不能作出有益的决定，因为它只能反映四国目前对于联邦共和国、苏联占领区和柏林现有条件的分歧意见。美国政府认为：如果调查团要有效地进行工作，它就应该由公正的团员组成，不应受否决权的限制或受四国的控制，并应有权自由地到德国各地去调查有关举行自由选举的可能性的条件。
    （四）至于第二个步骤，美国政府也同样地建议，一俟调查团提出了报告，美国、法国、苏联和联合王国政府的代表就立即举行会议，讨论早日在全德举行自由选举的问题，包括在有必要的地方创造适当的条件的问题。美国政府仍然坚持它这个建议，而对于这个建议，苏联政府尚未提出答复。美国政府再重复一遍它在五月十三日的照会第八节中所说的：“这种自由选举只有在德国各部分都存在必要的条件，并且不仅在投票之日和投票以前保持这些条件，而且要在投票之后也保持着这些条件时，才能举行。”
    （五）美国政府还进一步建议在这个会议上研究由四国政府提供的保证：经过自由选举成立的全德政府在和约生效以前的时期内，将有必要的行动自由。美国政府认为苏联政府提出的唯一具体建议就是，全德政府必须遵守波茨坦决定。这将意味着恢复四国管制制度，而依照原来的计划，这种制度只适用于“初期的管制时期”。这种办法会使已经证明行不通的管制制度复活，不仅于此，它而且是置近年来德国整个局势的演变于不顾。在这种管制下的一个德国政府，在对四国的关系上实际上是没有自由可言的，而且也不能够自由地与上述四国政府谈判和约。
    （六）美国政府并忧虑地注意到，苏联政府虽然在照会中一再申明它希望德国统一，可是它最近却无缘无故地在苏联占领区和柏林采取了一连串的措施，企图断绝苏联占领区的德国人与联邦共和国及柏林西区境内的五千万德国人的一切联系。这些措施加深了德国的人为分裂状态。美国政府愿意强调指出，最近与联邦共和国签订的协议使德国能够广泛而自由地与欧洲其他国家联合。正如美国政府在五月十三日的照会中所曾强调的，作为一个自由而平等的国家，德国有为了和平目的而和其他国家联合的基本权利。把这种权利予以剥夺是美国政府所不能容许的。此外，这些协定重申三国和联邦共和国决心促进德国的统一，并明白地表示三国保留关于缔结和约的权利，这种缔和应该是对全德国的缔和，应由四国和全德政府自由地谈判。
    （七）为了避免更多的拖延，美国政府与法国政府和联合王国政府，在跟德国联邦政府和柏林德国当局商量之后，共同一致地建议，假如四国政府都同意按照本照会第四节所谈的办法举行全德自由选举，并同意让自由的德国政府参加对德和约的谈判，就应该早日举行四国代表的会议。这样一个会议的目的就是对第一个问题取得协议，因为要想取得更大的进展就必须首先解决关于负责决定德国是否存在着自由选举所必需之条件的调查团的人选与职权的问题。美国政府建议四国代表讨论下述事项：
    甲、调查团的人选问题，务求保证调查团的公正；乙、调查团的职权问题，务求保证它能完全独立地向四国提出建议；丙、调查团完全自由不受干涉地进行调查的权力问题。
    （八）为了使自由选举得以举行，也必须依照美国政府五月十三日的照会第十一节（四）的建议，对成立全德政府的计划取得协议。因此，美国政府再次提出这个建议，供四国代表讨论这些更加重要的问题时参考。这个协议达成之后，便有可能进而着手统一德国。
    （九）鉴于苏联政府一再表示与其这样继续地交换照会，不如早日举行会议，美国政府确信，目前这个建议一定合于苏联政府的意思。
    苏联政府一九五二年八月二十三日的照会
    鉴于美国政府今年七月十日的照会，苏联政府认为有必要作如下的声明：
    一、苏联政府在五月二十四日的照会和以前的照会中向美国政府以及英国和法国政府建议立即开始进行关于缔结对德和约与成立全德政府的直接谈判。为了促进这些问题的解决，苏联政府早在三月十日就曾提出对德和约原则草案，供四国——苏联、美国、英国和法国——政府共同考虑，并表示也愿意讨论其他可能提出的关于这个问题的建议。然而，美国政府以及英国与法国政府规避就上述问题与苏联政府进行直接谈判，这是有案可考的。
    美国政府七月十日的照会证明：三国政府直到今天为止，仍然在继续拖延关于恢复德国统一和缔结对德和约等重要问题的讨论。二、美国、英国、法国政府一方面就德国问题长期与苏联政府交换照会，一方面却和阿登纳政府缔结了一项条约。三国政府悍然破坏波茨坦协定，在五月二十六日和波恩政府单独缔结一项所谓“协定”，把它叫做关于西方三国与德意志联邦共和国之间的关系的协定。在这以后，又有一个关于所谓“欧洲防务集团”的“协定”于五月二十七日在巴黎签字。签订这些“协定”的政府再一次地证明，它们对统一德国或缔结对德和约都丝毫不感兴趣，而是追求这样的目的：巩固并加深德国的分裂状态，把西德及西方三国政府正在组织的西德军队并入北大西洋集团，并且更充分地利用西德来达到这个集团的侵略目的。
    美国、英国和法国与阿登纳政府缔结的波恩单独
    “协定”，是一个公开的军事联盟，怀着显明的侵略意图。这个“协定”替德国军国主义的复活和法西斯希特勒将领领导下的西德雇佣军的成立披上了合法的外衣。我们给“协定”一词加上引号，是因为这个片面的波恩“协定”并不是西德人民自由地接受的；它是违反德国人民的意志强加到西德头上的。
    三国政府想尽一切办法在德国人民面前掩盖这个片面的波恩“协定”敌视德国民族利益与危害和平事业的本质。它们企图叫人相信这个“协定”使德国有机会“广泛而自由地与其他欧洲国家联合”，它们企图叫人相信，美国、英国和法国政府据说正在努力争取成立全德政府，据它们说，这个政府应享有一个政府所必需的行动自由和权力。可是，波恩单独“协定”的内容却处处和这些保证相矛盾。从波恩单独“协定”的内容来看就可以知道，西方三国政府，以德国特殊的国际地位作为藉口，原封不动地保留了它们的所谓“特别权利”。根据这些“特别权利”，美、英、法三国政府可以随便在西德领土上驻扎军队，可以随便在它们高兴的时候在西德境内宣布紧急状态，把一切大权都收到自己的手里。美国政府以及英法两国政府根据这个“协定”，取得了干涉西德内政的广泛权利，甚至于可以利用占领国的武力来强迫西德服从它们的意旨。
    这一切都说明，波恩单独“协定”不仅没有如美国政府在七月十日的照会中所说的那样，给德国开辟了今后自由发展的可能性，反而是消除了这样的可能，使西德仍然像在占领法规之下一样，完完全全服从和依赖占领当局。
    三、美国政府规避关于成立全德政府及缔结和约的直接谈判，为了要掩饰这种态度，就在七月十日的照会中提出了关于保证的问题，说什么四国应提出保证：经过自由选举成立的全德政府，在和约生效以前的时期内，将有必要的行动自由。
    但是，波恩单独“协定”存在一天，就根本谈不上全德政府的任何“行动自由”。“协定”第七条明白规定，建立一个统一的德国的可能性，取决于西方三国政府保留波恩“协定”上规定的一切特权，而这些特权却剥夺了德国的国家主权与独立。
    十分明白，美国政府以及英法两国政府签订波恩单独“协定”，实际上并不是为了统一德国、组成全德政府并给予全德政府真正的行动自由。美国政府在七月十日的照会中提出的关于保证未来全德政府的“行动自由”的问题，是一种遁辞，其目的是为了掩饰西方三国政府要使德国顺从它们的侵略目的的企图。
    鉴于美国政府在七月十日的照会中提出保证全德政府自由活动的问题——一个直接有关全德政府的权力的问题，苏联政府认为有必要提醒一下：苏联政府已在五月二十四日的照会中详尽地说明了它对这个问题的态度。照会声明：“至于全德政府及其权力，理所当然，这个政府也必须遵守波茨坦的决定，而在和约缔结后，则必须遵守和约条款，这个和约必须有助于促进欧洲持久和平。”这是直接根据波茨坦协定而来的，波茨坦协定规定了建立德国——一个和平、民主、独立、统一的德国——所应依据的各项原则。美国政府在西德的一切活动，与这些原则显然是矛盾的。
    有鉴于此，苏联政府认为必须指出：美国政府曲解苏联政府在五月二十四日的照会中提到波茨坦决定的意思，硬说这个照会意图“恢复四国管制制度”，虽然事实上苏联政府五月二十四日的照会并没有谈到恢复四国管制制度，只是指出了遵守波茨坦协定关于重新建立一个统一、独立、爱好和平和民主的德国的原则的必要。
    四、美国政府在七月十日的照会里再次提出，德国人民有权“为了和平目的而和其他国家联合”并缔结相应的协定的问题。在这个问题上，苏联政府已在四月九日的照会中提到苏联的对德和约原则草案中的一项条文，这项条文规定，德国有义务“不参加任何旨在反对任何一个曾以自己的军队参加对德作战的国家的集团或军事联盟”。非常明显，这样一项条文，绝不影响德国为和平目的而与其他国家联合的权利。然而，这样一项条文使德国不能参加北大西洋集团一类怀着侵略目的并进行有促成另一次世界战争危险的活动的集团。苏联政府仍然认为，这样一项条文绝没有不可容许地限制德国的主权，这项条文符合四国关于德国问题的协议，完全合乎德国一切邻国的利益，也同样地合乎德国自身的民族利益。
    五、美国政府在七月十日的照会中，提到德意志民主共和国目前为巩固自身安全而采取的措施，硬说这些措施“加深了德国的人为分裂状态”，它的目的是想断绝居住在德意志民主共和国境内以及西德境内的德国人的联系。
    这样一种说法完全没有一点根据。大家都知道，德意志民主共和国政府已经广泛地说明，上述措施是应人民的要求而采取的，因为德国西区为了挑衅目的派来了许多间谍、破坏分子、恐怖分子和走私分子，使人民遭受损失。这种活动是与正在奉行的重新武装及使西德参加新战争准备的政策直接有关的。
    六、作为对苏联政府在五月二十四日的照会中提出的关于立即开会共同研究对德和约及成立全德政府的建议的答复，美国政府宣称：在全德政府未成立以前，不可能拟订对德和约，因此，这个问题在目前应只限于成立一个德国问题调查团。然而这种说法与波茨坦协定并不相合。协定责成外长会议
    “准备德国之和平解决方案，此将于合乎目的之德国政府成立时，由德国政府予以接受”。
    苏联政府认为：美国政府以及英法两国政府在全德政府未成立以前拒绝拟订对德和约，是完全没有理由的。像美、英、法三国政府建议的那样，无限期地延不讨论对德和约及恢复德国统一这种重大问题，是不正确而且是绝对没有道理的。
    人们都看得出，美国政府的建议的用意是继续无限期地拖延下去不讨论对德和约及恢复德国统一的问题，也就是使占领军无限期地驻在德国。
    七、关于调查德国目前举行自由大选的条件的调查团的组成问题，苏联政府已在四月九日和五月二十四日的照会中说明了它的态度。
    美国政府谈到国际调查团对德国现状进行调查的某种好处。但是，建议成立德国问题国际调查团就是把德国变成了调查的对象，这样一个建议只能视为对德国民族的侮辱。这样一个建议的提议人一定是忘了，德国实行议会制度已经有一个多世纪，经常举行大选，并有着有组织的政党；因此这种通常向落后国家提出的要求是不应该向德国提出的。
    至于调查德国是否存在举行自由选举的条件的调查团应该由什么人组成的问题，我们认为，最客观的调查团莫过于经四国协议由德国人自己从德国人——例如德意志民主共和国人民议会和西德众议院的代表——中选拔出来的调查团。这样一个调查团既不侮辱德国人，同时将是走向德国统一的第一步。
    谈到在德国进行调查、以决定德国有无条件举行全德自由选举的问题，我们认为，首先必须检查波茨坦会议一部分决定的执行情况，这些决定的执行，是举行真正自由的全德选举以及成立表示德国人民意志的全德政府的必要前提。这些波茨坦会议的决定有：关于肃清德国军国主义的决定，以便如波茨坦协定所说的，“永远防止德国军国主义和纳粹主义的复活和改组”，使“德国永远不再威胁其邻国和世界和平”；关于实行波茨坦会议上所宣告的对德政治原则的决定，这些原则规定：“摧毁国社党暨其附属和监督的机构，解散一切纳粹组织，并确保此等机构不得以任何形式复活，所有纳粹军国主义的行动及宣传必须制止。”波茨坦会议的这些原则中有这样一条规定：
    “准备使德国政治生活得于民主基础上获得重新建立，并使德国将来在国际生活上参与和平合作。”
    八、美国、英国和法国政府建议召开一次四国政府代表会议，仅仅讨论调查德国是否存在着举行自由选举所必需的条件的调查团的组成、职务与权力问题。
    可以说：在这个问题上的意见的交换，已经使苏联政府与美、英、法三国政府之间的意见多少接近一些了。然而，苏联政府看不出有什么理由要把四国代表会议的讨论范围只限于关于上述调查团的问题。美国政府以及英国与法国政府限制上述四国代表讨论的问题的范围，并避免研究与德国有关的重大问题，这就使人觉得它们好像是在拚命使四国代表会议得不到什么成绩，或者完全没有结果。然而，苏联政府仍然准备在四国会议上讨论三国政府所提关于调查举行全德自由选举的条件的调查团的问题。但是，苏联政府同时认为不能，也绝不容许使会议只限于研究这一个问题。苏联政府认为这种会议必须首先讨论对德和约与成立全德政府之类的重要问题。
    根据上述观点，苏联政府建议在最近的将来，无论如何要在今年十月里面，召开一次四国代表会议，讨论以下的议程：
    甲、关于准备对德和约的问题；
    乙、关于成立全德政府的问题；
    丙、关于举行全德自由选举与成立调查德国举行这种选举的条件的调查团及其组成、职务与权力的问题。此外，苏联政府建议这次四国会议一并讨论占领军由德国撤退的日期的问题。苏联政府还建议在研究相应的问题时，邀请德意志民主共和国与德意志联邦共和国的代表参加会议。苏联政府并把同样的照会送交英国和法国政府。
