Letter from the Xing County People's Government of Shanxi Province Reflecting the Difficulty of Local People in Buying Sheep
To the Editor:
    In order to help the people of the old revolutionary base areas develop animal husbandry, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government allocated 480 million yuan in livestock loans to our county this year. Based on the demands of the masses and the local conditions for developing animal husbandry, we decided to use 60 percent of the total loan, or more than 280 million yuan, for sheep loans, estimating that we could buy more than 4,000 sheep. The loans began to be distributed on July 10th, and the masses were very happy and grateful for the care and assistance of the People's Government to the people of the old revolutionary base areas. However, after the masses received the loans, a major difficulty arose, namely, it was impossible to buy sheep anywhere. In the past, the source of sheep in the Xing County area was mostly from Shenmu and other places in Shaanxi Province; but this year it did not work. Cao Gougan, a herdsman from Caojiapo in our county, bought more than 60 sheep in Shijiaota, Shenmu County, but because the area was unwilling to sell its local sheep, the district office did not allow it, so he could not buy more sheep. After Cao Gougan returned to the county, he took an official letter from the Xing County People's Government to the Shenmu County People's Government for negotiation, but it was still ineffective. Later, after the former Xing County Special Office sent someone to negotiate with the Yulin Special Office, the issue of these 60-odd sheep was barely resolved (After discovering that it was impossible to buy sheep, the Xing County People's Government should have reported to the Special Office in a timely manner, and the province should have found a way to solve it through certain procedures; and should not have directly negotiated with Shenmu County. - Editor). The situation of not being able to buy sheep is very common in our county. Many people are running around with loans, and almost all the nearby sheep-producing areas such as Lin County and Kelan have been visited, but in the end, they could not buy any. Similar situations have also occurred in Lan County, Wutai and other places, and some people there have even come to our county to buy sheep. In this way, the masses are running back and forth, wasting a lot of manpower and materials, and the masses are very dissatisfied. They say: "Since the People's Government has given us loans to buy sheep, it should make it possible for us to buy sheep." According to our understanding, although many areas in Shaanxi Province produce sheep, they are unwilling to supply sheep to other areas in order to vigorously develop their own livestock industry. This is a very important issue, and we hope that the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government will find a way to solve it.

    山西兴县人民政府来信反映
    当地群众要求解决买不到羊群的困难
    编辑同志：山西省人民政府为了帮助老根据地人民发展畜牧事业，今年拨给我县四亿八千万元的畜牧贷款。我们根据群众要求与当地发展牧畜业的条件，决定以贷款总数的百分之六十即二亿八千余万元用做羊群贷款，估计可买羊四千余只。七月十日开始发放贷款，群众都很高兴，十分感激人民政府对老根据地人民的关怀和帮助。但是，群众拿到贷款以后，发生了一个很大的困难，就是到处买不到羊群。过去，兴县一带羊的来源，大部是从陕西省神木等地输入；可是今年不行了。我县曹家坡牧民曹狗蛋在神木县石角塔买了六十多只羊，因该区不愿本地的羊群外销，区公所没有允许，所以买不到更多的羊。曹狗蛋回县后又拿着兴县人民政府的公函去神木县人民政府交涉，但仍然无效。后来经过前兴县专署派人到榆林专署交涉，这六十多只羊的问题才勉强解决了（兴县人民政府在发现买不到羊的情况以后，应及时报告专署，由省通过一定的手续设法解决；而不应直接和神木县交涉。——编者）。买不到羊的情况在我县很普遍，很多群众拿着贷款东奔西跑，附近产羊地区如临县、岢岚等地几乎都跑遍了，终究没有买到。在岚县、五台等地也发生了同样的情况，那里有些人还跑到我县来购买羊群。这样，各地群众往返奔忙，人力物力都有很大浪费，群众非常不满意，他们说：“人民政府既然发给我们买羊贷款，就应该使我们有羊可买。”据我们了解，陕西省许多地区虽然产羊，他们为了大力发展本区畜牧事业，所以不愿意把羊群供给外区。这是一个十分重要的问题，希望中央农业部和山西省人民政府农林厅设法解决。
