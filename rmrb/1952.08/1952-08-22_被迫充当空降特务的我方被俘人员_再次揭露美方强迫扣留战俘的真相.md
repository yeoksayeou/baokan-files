Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 21st: Our correspondent reports: After unreasonably demanding a one-week recess for the third time, the chief US negotiator, Harrison, returned to the conference tent on August 19th and continued to repeat the shameless platitude of "not forcing the repatriation of prisoners of war with bayonets." However, the Korean and Chinese side already possesses an increasing amount of undeniable material proving that the US is in fact using bayonets to force prisoners of war to abandon their right to repatriation and forcing them to serve as cannon fodder in the war of aggression. Providing this material is another group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were forced by the US to act as special agents and airdropped into our area. After being captured by the US, they were assigned to the 86th Regiment and 72nd Regiment of the US POW camp on Geoje Island. In February and March of this year, they were forcibly sent to the US special agent school in Tokyo for a month of special agent training, and in March and April they were airdropped into our area one after another.

These prisoners of war, forced to act as special agents, reported to our side how, in order to create conditions for forcibly detaining prisoners of war, the US instructed Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to use all kinds of terror to force prisoners of war to tattoo reactionary slogans on their bodies and sign "petitions" for "voluntary repatriation" with their blood. Chiang Kai-shek's special agents even beat prisoners of war until they were injured or unconscious, and then forcibly tattooed words on their bodies, and dipped their wounds in blood to put their fingerprints on the "petitions" on their behalf. According to several prisoners of war who had been assigned to the 86th Regiment of the US POW camp, in November of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the regiment gathered more than 500 prisoners of war who firmly refused to be tattooed and write blood letters, and formed them into a company, imprisoning them in several tents of the 5th Battalion of the regiment. These tents were surrounded by barbed wire and heavily guarded, and other prisoners of war were not allowed to approach. Every night, Zou Yongda, the Chiang Kai-shek special agent who was the security captain of the regiment, personally used torture to force them to tattoo and write blood letters. The tents were filled with the shouts of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, the sounds of torture instruments, and the prisoners of war's tragic cries all night long. The atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents continued for more than a month. In the other two tents, which were specially used to imprison prisoners of war who had been severely injured, there were often sixty or seventy prisoners of war lying on the ground groaning and shouting. In order to cover up their crimes, the US hung "sanatorium" signs on these two tents. After forcing prisoners of war to tattoo and write blood letters, the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents threatened the prisoners of war and said: "Returning like this will only lead to death."

These prisoners of war forced to act as special agents also personally experienced the "screening" forcibly conducted by the US against prisoners of war with bayonets. In October of last year, the prisoners of war of the 86th Regiment were escorted by Chiang Kai-shek special agents to two newly built tents in the center of the camp for "screening." The "screening" was conducted by six Chiang Kai-shek special agents, flanked by burly men - security guards - who specialized in beating people with wooden sticks. The questions asked by the Chiang Kai-shek special agents were: "Go to Taiwan or return to the mainland?" When a prisoner of war answered "Return to the mainland," the Chiang Kai-shek special agent would ask with a ferocious look: "Why return to the mainland?" "Are you still loyal to the Communist Party?" When a prisoner of war still firmly demanded to return to his motherland, he was considered a "reactionary element" and subjected to torture and cruel punishment. Even more vicious was that after the "screening," the Chiang Kai-shek special agents deliberately reduced the rations of prisoners of war who resolutely demanded to return to their motherland, assigned them to do hard labor, and used this as an excuse to torture and persecute them, in an attempt to force them to submit. A prisoner of war from Sichuan in the 5th Battalion of the regiment was beaten until his skin was torn and his flesh was mangled for insisting on returning to his country. The Chiang Kai-shek special agents not only did not give him medical treatment, but also persecuted him in every way. One day in the middle of the night, he risked his life to escape across the barbed wire, but was caught by the US military, beaten severely, and carried back breathlessly. The Chiang Kai-shek special agents continued to use torture and persecution to force him to "refuse repatriation." In the end, he was driven to the point of mental derangement, shouting all day long: "I must return to my country, I must go home." The Chiang Kai-shek special agents finally imprisoned him. This is the truth about the "screening" hidden behind Harrison's lie that "it is actually encouraging these people to return to your control."

These prisoners of war forced to act as special agents were escorted to Tokyo by the US to receive special agent training before being airdropped into our area. Anyone who expressed unwillingness to work as a special agent would be persecuted or even killed innocently. In early October of last year, Guo Baotong, a prisoner of war from the 72nd Regiment, was drowned in the sea after being forced to "train" at the US special agent school in Daegu and refusing to act as a special agent. In early April of this year, Li Shoucheng, a prisoner of war from the 72nd Regiment, also expressed his unwillingness to act as a special agent after being sent to Seoul. One night in the middle of the night, he was suddenly taken away for a "talk" by a South Korean instructor surnamed Jin. This US special agent threatened him ferociously: "If you are unwilling to do intelligence work for the United Nations army, you can only come alive and die!" However, many prisoners of war were still unwilling to act as special agents. Among them, Yu Li, Jin Ge, and Wang Naiyong, prisoners of war from the 72nd Regiment, risked their lives to escape over the wall one after another in the middle of the night. The prisoner of war Li Liqiang also committed suicide because he was unwilling to act as a special agent. In his suicide note, he wrote:

"I am Chinese. I will never be a sacrifice to the American war gamble."

The names of these many prisoners of war forced to act as special agents have all been listed on the list of prisoners of war handed over to us by the US, and they all have US detention numbers. Even the most shameless liar Harrison has never dared to deny these facts. Harrison's fabricated ghost stories of prisoners of war "committing suicide when they return home" or "already escaping" have been exposed, so he can only resort to base and shameless methods such as long recesses and abusive instigation. However, these methods will never enable the US to achieve its goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The Korean and Chinese side will fight to the end for the principle of complete repatriation of all prisoners of war on both sides to return home and live peaceful lives in the already agreed-upon draft armistice agreement.

### 被迫充当空降特务的我方被俘人员  再次揭露美方强迫扣留战俘的真相

    被迫充当空降特务的我方被俘人员
    再次揭露美方强迫扣留战俘的真相
    【新华社开城二十一日电】本社记者报道：美方谈判首席代表哈利逊在三次无理地要求休会一周以后，八月十九日回到会议帐篷内，依然重复“不能用刺刀强迫遣返战俘”的无耻滥调。但是朝中方面手里已握有日益增多的不容抵赖的材料，证明美方事实上却在用刺刀强迫战俘放弃遣返的权利，强迫他们充当侵略战争的炮灰。提供这些材料的是又一批被美方强迫充当特务而空降到我方地区的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。他们在被美方俘掳以后，曾被编在巨济岛美方战俘营第八十六联队和第七十二联队。今年二、三月间，他们先后被强迫到东京的美方特务学校中，受了一个月特务训练，三、四月间先后被空降到我方地区。
    这些被迫充当特务的战俘，向我方报告了美方为了制造强迫扣留战俘的条件，如何指使蒋匪特务用尽恐怖手段，强迫战俘在身上刺反动口号和在“自愿遣返”的“请愿书”上签名盖血印。蒋匪特务甚至把战俘打伤、打昏，然后强行在他们身上刺字，并且醮他们伤口的血，代他们在“请愿书”上捺下指印。据几个曾被编在美方战俘营第八十六联队的战俘报告说：去年十一月间，该联队的蒋匪特务把五百多个坚决拒绝刺字和写血书的战俘，集中编成一个中队，囚禁在该联队五大队的几个帐幕里。这些帐幕的四周围着铁丝网，密布岗哨，其他战俘一概不准走近。每天夜里，联队警备队长蒋匪特务邹永达亲自用酷刑强迫他们刺字和写血书。帐幕里整夜传出蒋匪特务的叱喝声、刑具声、和战俘的凄厉的喊叫声。蒋匪特务的暴行继续了有一个多月之久。在另外两个专门囚禁被打得负重伤的战俘的帐幕里，经常有六、七十个战俘躺在地上呻吟和喊叫。为了掩饰罪行，美方在这两个帐幕上挂了“休养室”的牌子。在强迫战俘刺字和写血书后，美蒋特务就恫吓战俘们说：“这样回去就只有死路一条。”
    这些被迫充当特务的战俘也曾亲身经历过美方用刺刀对战俘强迫进行的“甄别”。去年十月间，第八十六联队的战俘被蒋匪特务挨次押到营场正中新搭的两个帐幕里去进行“甄别”。负责“甄别”的是六个蒋匪特务，在他们两旁的是拿着木棍专司殴打的彪形大汉——警备队员。蒋匪特务所问的问题是：“到台湾去还是回大陆去？”当战俘回答“回大陆去”时，蒋匪特务就面目狰狞地盘问：“为什么回大陆去？”“是不是还忠诚于共产党？”当战俘仍然坚决要求返回祖国时，就被认为是“反动分子”而遭到拷打和酷刑。更毒辣的是在“甄别”以后，蒋匪特务对坚决要求返回祖国的战俘，故意减少他们的口粮，派他们做苦工，借故拷打和迫害他们，企图借此逼使他们屈服。该联队五大队一个四川籍的战俘，因坚持回国，被打得皮开肉烂，蒋匪特务不但不给他医治，还处处迫害他。有一天半夜他冒险越过铁丝网逃跑，又被美军逮住，被毒打了一顿，气息奄奄地抬了回来。蒋匪特务仍继续用虐待和迫害的手段逼迫他“拒绝遣返”。最后他被逼得神经失常，整天喊着：“我一定要回国，一定要回家。”蒋匪特务最后把他囚禁了起来。这就是掩藏在哈利逊所声称的“实际上是鼓励这些人回到你们控制之下”谎言后面的“甄别”真相。
    这些被迫充当特务的战俘在空降到我方地区之前，曾被美方押送到东京受特务训练。任何人如果表示不愿作特务工作，就会遭到迫害甚至被无辜杀害。去年十月初，第七十二联队的战俘郭宝同在大邱的美方特务学校中被迫“受训”结束后，拒绝充当特务，就被抛在海里淹死。今年四月上旬，第七十二联队的战俘李守成在被送到汉城以后也表示不愿充当特务。有一天半夜，他突然被一个南朝鲜籍姓金的教官找去“谈话”。这个美方特务狰狞地恐吓他说：“如果不愿替联合国军做情报工作，只有活着来，死了去！”但是许多战俘仍然不愿充当特务。其中第七十二联队的战俘余隶、金戈、王乃庸先后在半夜冒生命危险越墙逃走。战俘李立强也因不愿充当特务而自杀。在他身上留下的遗书中写着：
    “我是中国人。我决不做美国战争赌局的牺牲品。”
    这许多被迫充当特务的战俘的名字，都曾开列在美方交给我方的战俘名单上，并且都有美方编的拘留号码。对于这些事实，就是最无耻的撒谎者哈利逊也一直不敢否认。哈利逊所编造的战俘“回家就要自杀”或“已经逃亡”的鬼话既已拆穿，因此只能采取长期休会、漫骂挑拨等卑鄙无耻的办法了。但是，这些手段将永远不会使美方达到其强迫扣留战俘的目的。朝中方面将为双方业已同意的停战协定草案中全部遣返双方战俘回家过和平生活的原则奋斗到底。
