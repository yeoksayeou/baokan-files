Xinhua News Agency, August 24th, dispatch from TASS, August 23rd: Forty-three American social celebrities jointly issued a statement on August 20th, calling for an immediate end to the Korean War and announcing that they would jointly hold a national peace vote with the "American Peace Crusaders." Among those who signed the statement were Professor Du Bois, Professor Morrison, writer Howard Fast, Dr. Kingsbury, Chairman of the National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association, Professor Lawerette, the famous economist Nearing, Dr. Baorong, Chairman of the Women's Committee for Peace, Robertson, Professor Routh Berry, bacteriologist, and Dr. Uphouse, one of the leaders of the American Peace Crusaders.

The statement, after recalling that the vast majority of the American people had expressed their hope for an end to the Korean War in a variety of ways, said: "The American people hope to solve all outstanding issues through meetings rather than bloodshed. We have a responsibility to humanity and to society to tell our political and military leaders: The people want the Korean War to stop. They have announced plans to bomb seventy-eight cities in Korea. This is a plan to expand death and destruction. ...Therefore, our responsibility is even greater."

The statement also said: "1952 is a year of great significance for elections in our country. Every citizen is very clear about the importance of this election and their role as voters. We firmly believe that the American people universally hope to end the Korean War, and if we raise this issue in the election, then candidates for public office, especially presidential candidates, will have to agree to the people's demand to stop the Korean War. Therefore, we call on good men and women across the country to participate in this national vote on ending the Korean War through an immediate ceasefire and resolving all outstanding issues through meetings. The results of the vote will be submitted to all candidates for public office, especially candidates for members of both houses of Congress and the President. We call on churches, trade unions, social organizations, women's organizations, youth organizations, clubs, and other organizations of all kinds to participate and mobilize people to support the national peace vote in order to end the cruel Korean War."

Xinhua News Agency, August 25th, San Francisco dispatch: American Progressive Party presidential candidate Vincent Hallinan wrote to Republican presidential candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower and Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson on the 21st, calling on them to jointly demand that Truman immediately conclude a ceasefire agreement in Korea.

In his letter, Hallinan said: The American people absolutely do not support a policy that makes our people make meaningless sacrifices in the current war. Currently, the Korean War continues because the issue of repatriating Korean and Chinese prisoners of war has not been resolved. Hallinan pointed out: "Since our government has signed the Geneva Convention stipulating the repatriation of prisoners of war, this issue should not be difficult to resolve."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS, New York, August 21st: American newspapers continue to publish letters from the parents and relatives of American soldiers in Korea, who unanimously demand that their children be sent back home.

The "Louisville Courier-Journal" published a letter from Mrs. Jim Avis of Bardstown, Kentucky, saying: "I am once again appealing on behalf of the millions of soldiers in Korea: send them back to their families. Soldiers are losing their lives every day, while war profiteers are making more and more money. ...American people, now is the time to get these children back home. We go to Congress to demand that our children be sent back home. We refuse to vote for anyone who cannot find a way to get our children back home."

Another letter published in the newspaper was sent by Mrs. Omer Lacard of Buffalo, Kentucky. The letter said: "Let's go to the White House or anywhere else, or think of any way to get our loved ones back home." The "Chicago Daily News" published a similar letter from Caroline Berger of Chicago, saying: "Conduct a poll on every street corner, asking the question: What gift would the American people be most grateful for? Most people would say: Peace in Korea, because peace means the end of the suffering of millions of families with loved ones in Korea or soldiers drafted to Korea. So we very much hope to hear Eisenhower and Stevenson say how they suggest bringing the slaughter in Korea to a swift and peaceful end."

In its editorial, the "Chicago Daily News" said: Neither the Democratic Party's platform nor the Republican Party's platform proposes a solution to the Korean War. The newspaper said: Considering the mood of the masses, "Korea should be a major issue in the campaign platform" because it has caused great anxiety to the American public.

    美国名流和侵朝美军士兵家属
    呼吁立即停止侵朝战争
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社二十三日消息：美国社会名流四十三人于八月二十日联名发表声明，呼吁立即停止朝鲜战争，并宣布与“美国和平十字军”共同举行全国和平投票。在声明上签字的有：杜波依斯教授、摩里逊教授、作家法斯特、美苏友好协会全国委员会主席金斯伯利博士、劳维特教授、著名经济学家尼林、妇女争取和平委员会主席巴奥朗博士、罗伯逊、鲁斯贝利教授、细菌学家、美国和平十字军领导人之一厄普毫斯博士等。
    声明在追述绝大多数美国人民曾通过多种多样的方式表示希望结束朝鲜战争以后说：“美国人民希望不再用流血的办法而用会议的办法解决一切还没有解决的问题。我们对人类和对社会有责任向我们的政治和军事领袖说：人民希望停止朝鲜战争。他们宣布了轰炸朝鲜七十八个城市的计划。这是扩大死亡和毁灭的计划。……因此我们的责任更加重了。”
    声明又说：“一九五二年是我国历史上有着重大意义的选举的一年。每一个公民都非常明白这次选举的重要性和自己作为选民的作用。我们深信，美国人民普遍希望结束朝鲜战争，如果我们在选举中提出这个问题，那么公职候选人，特别是总统候选人就会不得不同意人民希望停止朝鲜战争的要求。因此，我们号召全国善良的男女参加这个就通过立即停火以结束朝鲜战争并用会议的办法解决一切尚未解决的问题这件事举行的国民投票。投票的结果将提交所有的公职候选人，特别是两院议员和总统的候选人。我们呼吁教会、工会、社会、妇女、青年、俱乐部等各种组织都参加并动员人们支持全国和平投票，以便终止残忍的朝鲜战争。”
    【新华社二十五日讯】旧金山消息：美国进步党总统候选人哈利南在二十一日写信给共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔和民主党总统候选人史蒂文森，呼吁他们和他联合要求杜鲁门立刻在朝鲜缔结停火协定。
    哈利南在信中说：美国人民绝不支持使我国人民在目前这种战争中作无谓牺牲的政策。目前，就因遣返朝中战俘问题不得解决，而使朝鲜战争继续进行下去。哈利南指出：“由于我国政府曾在规定遣返战俘的日内瓦公约上签字，这个问题应该是不难解决的。”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约八月二十一日讯：美国报纸继续发表在朝鲜的美国士兵的父母和亲友们的来信，他们一致要求把他们的孩子们送回国去。
    “路易斯维尔邮报”发表肯塔基州巴德斯敦城吉姆·阿维斯夫人的来信，她说：“我再一次替在朝鲜的千万军人们呼吁：把他们送回国来交还给他们的家属吧。士兵们每天丧失生命，而战争贩子们却在赚着越来越多的钱。……美国人民，现在是把这些孩子们弄回国来的时候了。我们到国会去要求把我们的孩子送回国来。我们拒绝投任何人的票，倘若他不能设法让我们的孩子回国的话。”
    在该报上发表的另一封信，是肯塔基州布法罗地方奥默尔·拉卡德夫人寄来的。信上说：“我们到白宫去或者到其他任何地方去，或者想出任何办法使我们的亲爱的人们回国来吧。”“芝加哥每日新闻报”发表芝加哥地方卡罗琳·伯格尔寄来的同样一封信，信上说：“在每一个街角上举行民意测验，问这样一个问题：什么礼物是美国人民最感谢的？大多数人都要说：朝鲜的和平，因为和平意味着有亲爱的人在朝鲜的千万家庭或被征召往朝鲜去的军人们苦恼的告终。所以我们非常希望听到艾森豪威尔和史蒂文森说他们怎样建议使朝鲜的屠杀得到迅速的和平的结束。”
    “芝加哥每日新闻报”在社论中说：无论民主党的竞选纲领或者共和党的竞选纲领都没有提出解决朝鲜战争的办法。该报说：考虑到人民群众的情绪，“朝鲜应当是竞选政纲中的主要问题”，因为它已使美国公众感到极大的不安。
