    State-Owned Retail Trade in the German Democratic Republic
    In the heart of Dresden, German Democratic Republic, stands a striking new five-story building: the Dresden State Department Store. The dazzling array of everyday goods displayed inside attracts tens of thousands of customers. Almost daily, forty to fifty thousand people come from all over the Dresden area to shop, and almost everyone leaves happily with bags full of purchases.

    The Dresden State Department Store is famous throughout the German Democratic Republic. This is not only due to its ample goods and spacious, beautiful building, but mainly because its entire staff (90% of whom are women) won first place in the 1951 national department store sales competition due to their active work and rapid sales.

    With the development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic and the gradual improvement of the living standards of the working people, the state-owned retail trade in the German Democratic Republic has greatly developed. State-owned department stores have increasingly demonstrated their importance in the economic life of the people. The prosperity of the Dresden State Department Store is a good example.

    In November 1948, the German Democratic Republic only had one “non-rationed goods” trading store. Now, large state-owned department stores have been established in twelve major cities across the country, including Berlin, Dresden, Brandenburg, Magdeburg, and Leipzig. This August, a new department store building covering 6,000 square meters is under construction in the northern coastal city of Rostock. During the Five-Year Plan (from 1951 to 1955), state-owned department stores in Berlin, Magdeburg, Dresden, and other cities will be greatly expanded to meet the needs of national economic development and the increasing purchasing power of the people.

    The goods in the state-owned department stores can be said to be all-encompassing. People can not only buy domestically produced goods, but also Soviet textiles, Chinese tea and silk, Czechoslovakian shoes, and various goods produced by Poland, Hungary, and other People's Democratic countries. This illustrates the rapidly expanding economic ties between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and also demonstrates the abundance of products in the peace and democracy camp.

    The booming business of the state-owned department stores in the German Democratic Republic is largely attributed to the improvement of their business methods. In order to improve the supply of goods to the working people in urban and rural areas, state-owned department stores pay special attention to serving workers in large industrial areas, expanding the retail trade network among rural residents, and strengthening sales work in rural areas. Currently, the state-owned retail trade management department has established a customer service department and is preparing a catalog of goods with samples to send to various rural areas to facilitate farmers' purchases. State-owned department stores also frequently hold customer meetings to listen to opinions and requests from all customers in order to continuously improve the supply and management of goods.

    Many new work methods are currently being promoted in various state-owned department stores, such as sales competitions, regular publication of sales percentages for salesperson groups, and the establishment of a quick-sales bonus system.

    In the German Democratic Republic's Five-Year Plan, the consumption of food and daily necessities will greatly increase. By 1955, the consumption of meat and meat products will increase more than threefold compared to 1950, eggs will increase more than fivefold, textiles will increase nearly two and a half times, and shoes will increase more than three and a half times. This means that the sales volume of state-owned department stores in the German Democratic Republic will greatly increase, and their business will be further expanded.

    The rapid development of state-owned retail trade in the German Democratic Republic clearly demonstrates the improvement of living standards and the increase in happiness of the people of the German Democratic Republic in peaceful construction. The German people now see their own bright future in the development of peace and democracy.

    民主德国的国营零售贸易
    在民主德国德累斯顿的市中心，有一所引人注目的新的五层大楼，这就是德累斯顿的国营百货公司。这座大楼里陈设的五光十色、琳琅满目的日用百货，吸引着成千成万的顾客。几乎每天都有四、五万人从德累斯顿附近各地前来买货，而几乎每一个人都是提着大包小包欢欢喜喜地离去。
    德累斯顿国营百货公司在民主德国名闻全国。这不仅是由于它有着充足的货物和宽敞而漂亮的大楼，主要的是因为它在一九五一年民主德国全国百货公司的销货竞赛中因全体工作人员（百分之九十是妇女）工作积极、销货迅速而获得了第一名。
    随着德意志民主共和国国民经济的发展和全国劳动人民生活水平的逐渐提高，民主德国的国营零售贸易有了很大的发展。国营百货公司在全国人民的经济生活中已日益显示其重要性。德累斯顿国营百货公司业务的兴盛就是一个很好的例子。
    在一九四八年十一月的时候，民主德国还只有一个“非配售货”的贸易商店，而现在则在柏林、德累斯顿、勃来腾堡、马格德堡和来比锡等全国十二个大城市中都设立了大的国营百货公司。今年八月，北部沿海的罗斯多克市正在兴建一座占地六千平方公尺的新的百货公司大厦。在五年计划（从一九五一年到一九五五年）期间，柏林、马格德堡、德累斯顿以及其他城市的国营百货公司，都要大加扩充，以应国民经济发展和人民购买力不断提高的需要。
    国营百货公司的货物可说是应有尽有的。人们不但可以买到本国出产的货物，而且还可以购到苏联的纺织品，中国的茶叶和丝绸，捷克斯洛伐克的鞋靴，以及波兰、匈牙利等人民民主国家所出产的各种货物。这说明了民主德国与苏联和人民民主国家的经济联系正在迅速扩大，同时也说明了和平民主阵营各国的物产丰盛。
    民主德国国营百货公司业务的蒸蒸日上，在很大的程度上归因于它们的经营方法的改善。为了改进对于城乡劳动人民的货物供应，国营百货公司特别注意为大工业区的工人们服务，并在农村居民中扩大零售贸易网，加强农村中的销货工作。现在国营零售贸易管理部门已设立了顾客服务部，并正在准备一种带有样品的百货品名目录，以便送往各地农村，便利农民选购。国营百货公司也常常举行顾客会议，听取各方面顾客的意见和要求，以便不断改善货物的供应和经营。
    在各个国营百货公司中，目前正在推行许多新的工作方法，如销货竞赛，定期公布售货员小组的销售百分率，设立快销奖金制度等等。
    在民主德国的五年计划中，食物和日用品的消费量将有很大的增加。到一九五五年时，肉类和肉类制品的消费量将比一九五○年增加三倍多，鸡蛋增加五倍多，纺织品增加近二倍半，鞋靴增加三倍半以上。这就是说，民主德国的国营百货公司的售货量将要大大地增加，它们的业务将要进一步扩充起来。
    民主德国的国营零售贸易的迅速发展，清楚地说明了德意志民主共和国人民在和平建设中生活水平的提高与幸福的增进。德国人民现在已从和平与民主的发展中看到了他们自己的美好的将来。
