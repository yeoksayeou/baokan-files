The Patriotic Health Campaign is gradually expanding from cities to rural areas, and rural sanitation conditions have significantly improved. In East China, Northeast China, and other regions, the movement is closely integrated with production, which has not only improved rural environmental sanitation but also increased fertilizer, guaranteeing this year's bumper harvest.

In East China, the vast majority of rural people in Shandong Province have participated in the Patriotic Health Campaign. According to incomplete statistics, more than 52,600 villages have launched cleaning campaigns. Regular daily sweeping and "a shovel of soil after defecation" have become common hygienic habits among the masses. Pingyuan County mobilized more than 80,000 people, including teachers, students, and members of rural theatrical troupes, to form propaganda teams and use forms of propaganda popular with farmers to educate more than 60 percent of the county's population, making them realize that only good health can guarantee production, breaking down their erroneous idea that "hygiene is good, but it delays production." In the rural areas of Southern Jiangsu, the Patriotic Health Campaign was closely integrated with production, solving the problem of time and labor allocation. For example, Dantu County's Dalu District seized the gaps in the busy farming season to carry out a major cleaning campaign, covering more than 10,000 manure pits in four days; both inside and outside the houses were thoroughly cleaned, achieving no accumulated soil in the homes and no weeds in the yards. Some districts and townships mobilized women to participate in the major cleaning campaign; old women organized themselves to set up nurseries; and children participated in catching mice and eliminating flies. This allowed male laborers to participate in production, making the movement fast and without hindering production. The Patriotic Health Campaign also broke down the superstitious ideas of some people in rural areas. For example, in Liyang's Citang Township, many farmers were previously unwilling to dig up the stinky manure pits and stinky ponds that had existed for decades, fearing that it would "dig away wealth" and that "disturbing the earth god would bring bad luck." However, after education, everyone realized the importance of hygiene, moved more than 100 manure tanks to appropriate places and covered them; the stinky ponds were also filled; and the houses and livestock pens were cleaned very neatly. Townships in Danyang and other places also mobilized the masses to inspect each other and evaluate their performance, turning sanitation work into a regular task. In Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu, 180 townships have held major cleanups, and now, "turning domestic soil into wild fertilizer," "clean homes, fertile fields, fewer illnesses, and more grain" has become the slogan for carrying out the sanitation campaign in rural Northern Jiangsu. Some villages and towns in Suqian, Yancheng, Gaoyou, and other counties immediately transported the garbage to the fields for fertilizer after the major cleaning campaign. Anhui Province also put forward the slogan in rural areas of "Cleaning cattle and pig pens should be combined with summer topdressing." According to preliminary statistics from Su County (excluding Sihong County), the counties cleaned more than 80,000 cattle and pig pens, increasing fertilizer and guaranteeing the completion of the production increase plan. Mosquitoes are difficult to eliminate in rural areas, but farmers in various parts of Anhui use the cheapest mugwort leaves, artemisia, sawdust, and other materials to smoke mosquitoes, reducing diseases. The Patriotic Health Campaign in Fujian and Zhejiang is also shifting from cities to rural areas. Some districts and towns in Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, promoted the development of the movement through people's representative conferences. Now, "cleanliness is glorious, dirtiness is shameful" has become a new moral concept for the vast majority of farmers.

The vast rural areas of Northeast China have also achieved many successes in the Patriotic Health Campaign. For example, farmers in the suburban townships of most cities and counties in Western Liaoning and Rehe participated in the sanitation campaign in close conjunction with spring plowing and summer hoeing. In the suburbs of Jinzhou City, Panshan, Jin County, and many other rural areas in Western Liaoning, attention to environmental sanitation, garbage removal, and manure management has greatly increased the amount and area of fertilization, playing a certain role in increasing yield per unit area. Farmers in many villages and towns have recognized the harm of lice and launched a lice eradication campaign. The masses in eight natural villages in Wujia Village, Fourth District of Panshan, voluntarily established seven lice eradication stations to eradicate lice for the people of the entire village. Other counties such as Kuandian, Dunhua, Jiaohe, Acheng, Yian, and Zhuanghe have also achieved considerable success in sanitation work through extensive and in-depth publicity and the active leadership of party members and cadres. In particular, Zhuanghe, Kuandian, Yian, and other counties have absorbed experiences such as combining key points with the overall situation, combining hygiene with fertilizer accumulation, and promoting the overall situation with typical examples, enabling the movement to develop rapidly. In Zhuanghe County, due to the sanitation campaign during spring plowing, the county's average fertilizer application increased by 300 to 400 jin per mu. Kuandian, Yian, and other counties used the strength of women and children to solve the contradiction between hygiene and production, making them a regular force in maintaining hygiene. Some production mutual aid groups in Acheng have also established hygiene and fertilizer accumulation plans, making the Patriotic Health Campaign and the fertilizer accumulation movement regular. Wang Guofu, the village head of Henan Village, Xinzhan District, Jiaohe County, cleared dirty pits and ash soil, increasing fertilizer by 35 carts, and fertilized the four and a half mu of land that he had originally planned not to fertilize. He estimated that this would increase the yield by at least one shi and five dou of grain. Various places in Rehe Province have also paid attention to combining production and accumulating fertilizer. Now, some townships are competing with each other to win the honorary titles of "fly-free zone" and "rat-free zone."

Since the Patriotic Health Campaign was extended to rural areas in Central and Southern China, it has also achieved significant results. In the vast rural areas of Jiangxi Province, a widespread movement to eliminate infectious diseases has been launched. In this movement, 80 percent of the villages and towns in Shangrao Prefecture conducted relatively thorough cleaning campaigns. In the rural areas of Hukou County, the superstitious ideas of the masses that "opening windows will ruin feng shui and lose money" were broken. Wannian County accumulated 120,000 dan of fertilizer while clearing garbage, solving the serious fertilizer shortage problem. Farmers in many places in Hunan Province put forward the slogan "Never let disease destroy production" and enthusiastically participated in the movement. After the sanitary conditions in the whole region changed, the number of diseases has been greatly reduced compared with previous years.

The Patriotic Health Campaign in Northwest and Southwest China has also been launched in small and medium-sized cities and some rural areas. In the vast rural areas of Ningxia Province, whether in concentrated villages or scattered stockaded villages, a new atmosphere has emerged. The infant mortality rate in rural Western Sichuan has also been greatly reduced. According to surveys in Guanghan, Shifang, Peng County, and other places, the infant birth mortality rate has dropped from about 50 percent before liberation to about 3 percent. The livestock mortality rate has also decreased by 40 to 75 percent compared to the past.

However, some areas still do not pay enough attention to the Patriotic Health Campaign. Some villages have not taken any action so far, or have only done it superficially. Leading cadres in some areas of Hunan Province do not understand the situation below, only know how to issue instructions, send telegrams, and ask for numbers, without specific leadership; some cadres have a purely task-oriented viewpoint in their thinking, thus leading to the phenomenon of coercion and commandism. For example, in Wangcheng County, only two of the 15 districts cleaned their houses in conjunction with the fertilizer accumulation movement, while the other districts did not even know what the Patriotic Health Campaign was all about, so a mass movement was not created. Other townships in Xiangtan, Liling, Xiangxiang, Hengshan, Yiyang, and other counties do not pay enough attention to the Patriotic Health Campaign, and the Patriotic Health Campaign has not been generally carried out in remote areas such as Fenghuang County. These phenomena must be corrected quickly.

    爱国卫生运动逐步深入广大农村
    密切结合生产工作向经常化的方向发展
    【本报讯】爱国卫生运动由城市逐渐向农村推展，农村的卫生情况已有显著的改进。华东、东北等地，由于运动密切结合了生产，不仅改善了农村的环境卫生，而且增多了肥料，保证了今年的丰收。
    华东区山东省绝大部分农村人民都已投入爱国卫生运动。据不完全统计，有五万二千六百多个村庄先后开展了清洁运动。每日定时洒扫和“便后一锨土”，已成为群众普遍的卫生习惯。平原县曾动员了教员、学生、农村剧团的团员等共八万余人，组织宣传队，运用农民所喜爱的宣传形式，向全县百分之六十以上的群众进行教育，使群众认识到只有身体健康才能保证生产，打破了他们的“讲卫生好是好，就是要耽误生产”的错误观念。苏南各区乡在爱国卫生运动中，紧紧结合生产，解决了时间和劳动力调配问题。如丹徒县大路区抓住农忙季节的空隙进行大扫除，在四天内把一万余个粪坑加上了盖；屋内屋外，都进行了彻底打扫，做到家无积土，院无杂草。有些区乡发动妇女参加大扫除；老婆婆们则组织起来，成立托儿站；儿童参加捕鼠、灭蝇。这样就使男劳动力都能参加生产，使运动进行得既快又不妨碍生产。爱国卫生运动也打破了农村部分群众的迷信思想。如溧阳祠堂乡不少农民以前不肯把几十年的臭粪坑、臭水塘挖掉，怕“挖脱财气”，怕“动了土神，会倒霉”。但经过教育以后，大家认识到卫生工作的重要性，把一百多个粪缸搬到适当的地方，并加上了盖；臭水塘也填塞了；住屋、畜栏也打扫得非常整洁。丹阳等地的乡镇并发动群众相互进行检查，评比成绩，使卫生工作变成了经常工作。苏北盐城已有一百八十个乡举行过大扫除，现在，“家土变野肥”、“家里干净田里肥，人少生病粮多收”，已成为苏北农村开展卫生运动的口号。宿迁、盐城、高邮等县的一些村镇，在进行大扫除后，立即将垃圾运到田里作肥。安徽省在农村中也提出了“清理牛栏、猪栏要与夏季追肥结合起来”的口号。如宿县专区（泗洪县除外），据初步统计，各县共打扫了八万多个牛栏和猪栏，增加了肥料，保证了增产计划的完成。农村中的蚊子是很难消灭的，但安徽各地农民却利用最廉价的艾叶、黄蒿、锯屑等来熏蚊虫，减少了疾病。福建、浙江各地的爱国卫生运动，亦正由城市转入农村。浙江萧山的某些区镇，通过人民代表会议推动运动的开展。现在，“清洁光荣、肮脏可耻”已成为广大农民的新道德观念。
    东北区广大农村，在爱国卫生运动中也取得了不少成绩。如辽西、热河大部分市县的郊区乡镇农民在密切结合春耕、夏锄的情况下参加了卫生运动。辽西锦州市郊区、盘山、锦县和其它许多农村，由于注意了环境卫生，清除垃圾，管理粪便，大大增加了施肥量和施肥面积，对提高单位面积产量，起了一定作用。许多村镇的农民已认识到虱子的危害性，展开了灭虱运动。盘山四区吴家村八个自然屯的群众自动建立了七个灭虱站，为全村人民灭虱。其它如宽甸、敦化、蛟河、阿城、依安、庄河等县经过广泛深入的宣传，和党员、干部的积极带头，卫生工作也获得不少成绩。尤其是庄河、宽甸、依安等县，吸取了点面结合、卫生与积肥结合、以典型推广全面等经验，使运动得以迅速开展。庄河县在春季备耕时，由于开展了卫生运动，全县平均每亩地增加了三、四百斤粪肥。宽甸、依安等县运用了妇女和儿童的力量，解决了卫生与生产的矛盾问题，使他们成为坚持卫生工作的经常力量。阿城的一些生产互助组并订立了卫生积肥计划，使爱国卫生工作与积肥运动经常化。蛟河县新站区河南屯屯长王国福清除了脏坑和灰土，增加了三十五车肥料，把原来不打算再上粪的四亩半地也上了肥。据他估计，这样至少可以多打一石五斗粮食。热河省各地也注意到结合生产，攒粪积肥。现在，有些乡镇为了争取“无蝇区”、“无鼠区”的光荣称号，彼此展开了竞赛。
    中南区的爱国卫生运动，自向农村推展以来，也取得显著的成绩。江西省广大农村中，广泛地展开了消灭传染病的运动。在这一运动中上饶专区百分之八十的村镇进行了比较彻底的清洁大扫除。湖口县农村中并打破了群众中的“开窗户会坏风水、走钱财”的迷信思想。万年县在清除垃圾时积了十二万担肥，解决了严重的缺肥问题。湖南省很多地方的农民提出了“决不让疾病来破坏生产”的口号，热烈地投入运动。全区的卫生状况改变后，疾病已较往年大大减少。
    西北、西南区的爱国卫生运动也在中小城市和部分农村中开展起来。宁夏省的广大农村中，不管是集中的村庄，或是分散的寨堡，都呈现了新的气象。川西农村的婴儿死亡率也大为减少。据广汉、什邡、彭县等地的调查，婴儿出生死亡率已由解放前的百分之五十降低到百分之三左右。牲畜死亡率也比过去减少百分之四十至七十五。
    但是，某些地区对爱国卫生运动仍未重视。有些村子至今还没有动静，或者只是形式地搞一下。湖南省某些地区的领导干部对下面情况不了解，只知道发指示，打电报，要数字，不进行具体领导；有些干部在思想上存在着单纯任务观点，因而发生强迫命令的现象。如望城全县十五个区，仅两个区结合积肥运动打扫了一下房屋，其它几个区甚至还不知道爱国卫生运动是怎么一回事，因此未造成一个群众性的运动。其它如湘潭、醴陵、湘乡、衡山、益阳等县的部分乡镇对爱国卫生运动都不够重视，僻远的地方如凤凰县，爱国卫生运动普遍地没有开展。这些现象必须迅速纠正。
