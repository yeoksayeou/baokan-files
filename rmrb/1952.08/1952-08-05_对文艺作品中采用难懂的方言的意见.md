    Opinions on the Use of Difficult Dialects in Literary Works

    Editor: Recently, I read the novel "The Hurricane" by Comrade Zhou Libo. I found that it used many difficult-to-understand localisms, such as "maitai" (埋汰, to disparage), "laojin" (捞金, to pan for gold), "heixiazi" (黑瞎子, bear), "lada pai" (拉大排, to play a big role), etc. I couldn't understand them by guessing from the literal meaning, nor could I find them in any old or new dictionaries. This hinders our understanding and appreciation of the book's content.

    Many new literary works use dialects and localisms, not just "The Hurricane." Perhaps writers believe that only dialects and localisms are literary language, and the more they are used, the higher the artistic quality of the work. I think this view is questionable. The background of Comrade Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane" is the rural Northeast, so the book uses Northeast dialect. If he were to write a story about Guangdong, wouldn't he use Guangdong dialect? If many Cantonese sayings with sounds but no written characters are forcibly written down according to the sound, not only would people from other places not understand, but even Cantonese people might not fully understand them. Take Huarong, Hunan, where I live, which is not a remote place. The local dialect calls married women "姑娘" (gūniang, girl), and people say "我的姑娘" (wǒ de gūniang, my girl) to mean "my wife." They call father "爷" (yé, grandpa), grandfather "爹" (diē, father), broad beans "豌豆" (wāndòu, pea), and flies "蚊子" (wénzi, mosquito). If these localisms were used to write articles, how much misunderstanding would occur? But if written in standard Mandarin, not only would the locals understand, but so would people from other places. Therefore, I believe that except for works targeting ethnic minorities or intended only for people in a specific region, general literary works should be written in standard Mandarin as much as possible. Those localisms that have already become popular and are understood by many can, of course, be used appropriately; those that are not easily understood, or even words that a writer creates based solely on the sound, should not be used. Only in this way can they be universally accepted by readers across the country. Now that the whole country has been liberated, and transportation is accessible in all directions, the readers of literary works are no longer limited to one place but are spread throughout the country. Therefore, only literary works written in a universally recognized language can be read by the masses and play a popularizing role.

    However, I have another opinion regarding local operas. The cultural troupe in our county has performed very educational plays such as "The White-Haired Girl" and "Chiye River." The actors all spoke Northern Mandarin. Some actors spoke very well, but others had Southern accents mixed with some Northern localisms, which sounded like a "Southern tune and Northern tone." Some viewers couldn't understand it, making watching the play like solving a riddle. Although the general plot could be guessed, the detailed plot could not be fully understood. Later, after the cultural troupe went to Changsha for a joint performance, they changed their approach. They performed some simple plays in the local dialect, so the masses understood every sentence, and the educational effect was greatly improved. Therefore, I suggest that when local cultural troupes perform plays written in standard Mandarin, they should consider the audience. If the audience is local people, then they can slightly modify the lines based on not changing the original meaning, and perform in the local language, so that the masses can easily understand and it can better play its due role.

    Editor's Note: Reader Tang Shaoli's opinion is noteworthy. "The Hurricane" has made achievements in using the language of the masses, but it also has shortcomings, which is the unnecessary and excessive use of localisms that are not universally understood by the masses. This has somewhat limited the widespread circulation of an excellent literary work. The language issue in literary works is a problem that needs to be carefully studied and discussed by experts. We are publishing the above reader's opinion as a reference for researchers.

### 对文艺作品中采用难懂的方言的意见

    对文艺作品中采用难懂的方言的意见
    编辑同志：最近我读了周立波同志所作的小说“暴风骤雨”。我发现其中用了很多难懂的土语，例如：“埋汰”“捞金”“黑瞎子”“拉大排”等等。照字面来揣摩既不懂，找遍新旧词典也查不到。这就妨碍了我们对于这本书的内容的理解和欣赏。
    很多新文艺作品都采用方言土语，并不止“暴风骤雨”一本书。也许作家们认为只有方言土语才是文学语言，用得越多，作品的艺术性越高。我认为这种意见是值得怀疑的。周立波同志的“暴风骤雨”的背景是东北农村，所以书里边用的是东北土语。假如他写一个广东的故事呢？也许就用广东土语吧！如果把广东的很多有音无字的说话，勉强地照着声音把它写下来，这样不但别的地方的人不懂，恐怕连广东人也不会完全看懂的。就拿我们湖南华容这个不算偏僻的地方来说吧，当地土语把结过婚的妇女叫做“姑娘”，人们说“我的姑娘”，意思就是“我的媳妇”，叫父亲做“爷”，叫祖父做“爹”，把蚕豆叫做“豌豆”，把苍蝇叫做“蚊子”……如果用这些土语来写文章，会发生多大的误会呢？可是如果按照普通话来写，不但本地人懂得，别的地方的人也都懂得。因此我认为除了对象是少数民族或只准备给某一特殊地区的人看的作品外，一般文艺作品要尽可能地用普通话来写作。那些已经流行开了的，已经为很多人所了解的土语，当然也可适当采用；那些不易为人了解的，甚至是某一作家仅凭字音独创的词儿，应该不用。这样才能普遍地为全国的读者所接受。现在全国已经解放，交通四通八达，文艺作品的读者已不限于一地一隅而是遍于全国了，所以只有用被公认的普遍的语言所写出来的文艺作品，才能为广大群众所阅读，才能起到普及作用。
    但在地方戏方面，我有另外一个意见。我们县里的文工团曾演过“白毛女”“赤叶河”等很有教育意义的戏。演员们说的都是北方话。有的演员虽然说得很好，有的却带着南方口音，再夹杂了一些北方土语，听起来真有“南腔北调”之感。有些观众听不懂，使得看戏也像猜谜一样，戏剧内容虽然大体猜对了，但详细剧情却不能完全理解。后来文工团去长沙会演，回来以后，就改变了方式，他们用土语演出了一些简单的小剧，这样群众对每一句话都懂得了，起的教育作用就很大。因此我建议各地文工团在演出用普通话写的剧本时，要看对象，如果观众是本地的群众时，那就可以在不失原意的基础上，稍微把台词修改一下，用本地语言演出，这样就可以使群众易于理解，可以更好地起到它应有的作用了。湖南华容县粮食局唐绍礼
    编者按：读者唐绍礼的意见是值得注意的。“暴风骤雨”在运用群众语言方面是有成绩的，但同时也有缺点，就是不必要地过多地采用了不易为广大群众所普遍理解的土语。这使一部优秀的文艺作品在普遍流传方面受到了一些限制。关于文学作品的语言问题，是一个需要专家们进行很好的研究和讨论的问题。我们发表上面的读者意见可以作为研究者的参考。
