    Yanggao Longquansi Village Pays Attention to Manure Collection in the Patriotic Health Campaign
    Editor: Longquansi Village is located in the fifth district of Yanggao County, Chahar Province. In the past, the village's cattle, sheep, and pigs were not well managed, and they defecated and urinated everywhere; some people even tethered their livestock under their windows, resulting in a foul odor throughout the house. However, things are very different now. During the Patriotic Health Campaign, the people of the entire village whitewashed the walls of their houses, swept their courtyards every day; the streets were also swept very clean, and the four large puddles on the street were filled in, and the four wells all had covers. Most of the pigs in the village now have pigsties. This has not only ensured cleanliness and hygiene, but also accumulated more than 16,900 dan of fertilizer in four or five months, creating favorable conditions for patriotic production increase.

    阳高龙泉寺村在爱国卫生运动中注意积肥
    编辑同志：龙泉寺村在察哈尔省阳高县五区，过去该村的牛、羊、猪都没有很好地加以管理，到处拉屎拉尿；有的人家的窗口下就拴着牲口。因此满屋都是臭味。但是，现在和过去大不一样了。在爱国卫生运动中，全村人民把房屋的墙壁粉刷一新，每天打扫院子；街道也扫得很清洁，街上的四个大水坑也填平了，四个水井都有了盖子。全村的猪大都有了猪圈。这样不但保证了清洁卫生，并且在四、五个月之间，积肥一万六千九百多担，为爱国增产创造了良好的条件。
