Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 14th: In order to prepare conditions for the large-scale industrial construction that is about to unfold in our country, the Fuxin Mining Bureau of the Northeast Coal Mining Administration is building a large-scale open-pit coal mine. The construction of the Fuxin Open-Pit Coal Mine requires digging up 560 million cubic meters of surface soil, which is equivalent to the total amount of earth excavated to develop five Suez Canals and one Panama Canal. If these soils were piled into earth mountains 90 meters high, they would occupy 12,000 mu of land. After the open-pit coal mine is successfully built, the annual coal production will be equal to the total annual output of the Ping'an, Haizhou, and Xinqiu coal mines currently under the Fuxin Mining Bureau.

The development project of the Fuxin Open-Pit Coal Mine started in April 1951. Over the past year, all the personnel participating in the development of the Fuxin Open-Pit Coal Mine have been inspired by the enthusiasm for building a great motherland and have demonstrated a high degree of initiative. Although they did not know how to mine open-pit coal mines before, thanks to the sincere help of Soviet technical experts, they finally overcame various technical and management difficulties and quickly mastered the advanced technology and scientific management methods of building open-pit coal mines. For example, Fu Xiangxian, the head of the stripping section for the development of the open-pit coal mine, and Chen Cuiwen, the deputy head, used to work underground and on the railway, respectively, and did not understand the construction of open-pit coal mines. However, after more than a year of hard study, they sought help from others when they encountered difficulties, and consulted Soviet experts when they could not figure things out. Now they are fully capable of mastering this huge and complex project. Thousands of workers on the construction site have also quickly mastered the technology of modern open-pit coal mine development by diligently studying and overcoming difficulties. For example, Communist Party member Wang Lu has transformed from an underground coal miner into a model electric shovel operator. This year, the construction plan for the Fuxin Open-Pit Mine has also been completely formulated by our own technical personnel.

With the hard work of all the construction personnel and the help of Soviet experts, the construction of the Fuxin Open-Pit Coal Mine is progressing rapidly. At present, the actual amount of earth removed in this project is twice the original planned progress, and coal has been seen. By 1954, this open-pit coal mine will be able to mine a large amount of coal to meet the needs of economic construction.

### 东北阜新建规模宏大的露天煤矿

    东北阜新建规模宏大的露天煤矿
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】为了给我国即将展开的大规模工业建设准备条件，东北煤矿管理局阜新矿务局正在建设规模宏大的露天煤矿。阜新露天煤矿的建设，要挖去地面土壤五亿六千万立方公尺，等于开发五个苏彝士运河和一个巴拿马运河的挖土量的总和；要是把这些土堆成九十公尺高的土山，需占地一万二千亩。露天煤矿建设成功以后，每年产煤量等于现在阜新矿务局所属平安、海州、新邱三个煤矿全年产量的总和。
    阜新露天煤矿的开发工程是一九五一年四月开工的。一年多来，参加阜新露天煤矿开发工作的全体人员，在为建设伟大祖国的热情鼓舞下，发挥了高度的积极性。他们在以前虽然都不懂得露天煤矿的开采方法，但由于苏联技术专家的热诚帮助，终于克服了技术上和管理上的种种困难，迅速地掌握了建设露天煤矿的先进技术和科学的管理方法。如开发露天煤矿的剥离科科长傅象贤和副科长陈萃文，过去一个是在井下工作，一个在铁路上工作，对露天煤矿的建设都不懂得，但经过一年多的努力钻研，遇到困难便找人研究，研究不通再请教苏联专家，现在已完全能掌握这个庞大复杂的工程了。工地上成千上万的工人，也都因勤于学习，克服困难，迅速地掌握了现代化开发露天煤矿的技术。如共产党员王禄就由一个井下采煤工人，变成了模范的电铲上的司机手。今年阜新露天矿的施工计划也已完全由我国技术人员自己制订。
    阜新露天煤矿的建设，在全体施工人员的努力工作和苏联专家的帮助下，正以飞快的速度向前进展。目前，这一工程的实际剥土量已等于原计划进度的两倍，并已见煤。到一九五四年，这一露天煤矿就可开采大量煤炭供应经济建设需用。
