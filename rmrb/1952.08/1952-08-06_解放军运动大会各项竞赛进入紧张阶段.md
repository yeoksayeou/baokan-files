Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch:

    The People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Army Day Twenty-fifth Anniversary Sports Meet has entered a tense stage of competition. Various units are fiercely vying for the right to enter the finals, and many events will conclude their preliminary rounds in a day or two.

    Today, four basketball games were held. The strength of the four teams was very balanced, so the games were particularly heated. In the game between the Military Academy and the Southwest Military Region, the score fluctuated between one or two points in the second half. The result was a 70-70 tie, so they played an additional five minutes, still tied at eight points each. Until the very last moment, the Southwest Military Region's number eight player suddenly grabbed the ball and shot from a distance. The buzzer sounded just as the ball left his hand, and the ball went into the basket at the same time. The Military Academy lost to the Southwest Military Region by a narrow margin of two points, 78 to 80.

    While the basketball games were being held, the 15,000-meter bicycle preliminary round was also taking place on the track surrounding the court. Thousands upon thousands of spectators enthusiastically cheered and applauded every cyclist, while also nervously watching the movements of the athletes under the basketball net. The sports field was filled with an atmosphere of tension and excitement.

    Today also saw five men's volleyball games, five women's volleyball games, two baseball games, and two soccer games. The baseball and soccer group stage round robins have ended. The four units that have qualified for the soccer finals are the Air Force, the East China Military Region, the North China Military Region, and the Northeast Military Region. The units that have qualified for the baseball finals are the Public Security Forces, the North China Military Region, and the Northwest Military Region. The basketball group stage round robin is also nearing completion.

    Today, four tug-of-war matches were also held. The Military Academy's tug-of-war team, composed of twelve senior cadres, defeated the young men of the Public Security Forces with an absolute advantage of two to zero.

    The armored forces' motorcycle athletes gave a very outstanding performance. They first lifted the wheel of the sidecar of the three-wheeled motorcycle into the air, driving the vehicle on an angle; then they performed stunts such as riding on the vehicle, driving with one arm, stopping, changing wheels, swapping drivers, and driving backwards. The operation of these actions requires a high level of technical skill, a strong body and wrist strength.

    Today also held a 20,000-meter motorcycle race, the second round of the 6,000-meter cross-country horse race through ten obstacles, and the second round of the 1,200-meter armed horse race. The cavalry athletes of the General Logistics Department performed a 6,000-meter cross-country horse race demonstration.

    Literary and artistic competitions continue.

    解放军运动大会各项竞赛进入紧张阶段
    【新华社五日讯】人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会各项竞赛已进入紧张阶段。各单位剧烈地夺取决赛权，许多项目都将在一两天内结束预赛。
    今天举行了四场篮球赛。四个球队的力量都很平衡，所以打得特别热烈。军事学院和西南军区比赛到下半场时，双方胜负始终在一两分之间摆动。结果以七十对七十打成平局，于是延长五分钟再战，还是各得八分，不相上下。直到最后一霎间，西南军区八号球员忽然夺球远射，球刚离手，锣声就响了，球也同时进篮。军事学院仅以七十八对八十的二分之差败于西南军区。
    在举行篮球赛时，一万五千公尺的自行车预赛同时在球场外围的跑道上进行。成千成万观众一再热情地向每一个自行车运动员欢呼鼓掌，同时又紧张地注意着篮球网下运动员的动作。运动场上充满了紧张热烈的空气。
    今天还举行了五场男子排球赛和五场女子排球赛、两场棒球赛和两场足球赛。棒球和足球的分组循环赛已经结束。取得足球决赛权的有空军、华东军区、华北军区和东北军区四个单位。取得棒球决赛权的有公安部队、华北军区和西北军区。篮球的分组循环赛也即将结束。
    今天还举行了四场拔河比赛。军事学院十二个高级干部组成的拔河队，以二比零的绝对优势，拉倒了公安部队的小伙子。
    装甲部队的摩托车运动员作了非常出色的表演。他们首先把三轮摩托车附车下的轮子腾空，侧着车子行驶；然后又在车上作了骑人、单臂驾驶、停车、拆换车轮、互换司机、倒坐驾驶等技巧表演。操纵这种动作必须具有高度的技术水平和强壮的身体和腕力。
    今天还举行了两万公尺的摩托车比赛，通过十道障碍的六千公尺越野赛马次赛，一千二百公尺武装赛马次赛。总后方勤务部的骑兵运动员作了六千公尺越野赛马表演。
    文艺比赛继续进行。
