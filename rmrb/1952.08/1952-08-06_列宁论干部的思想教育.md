    Lenin on the Ideological Education of Cadres
    Soviet Union Kondratiev

    The Communist Party and Comrade Stalin educate our cadres with Lenin's brilliant thought. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and Comrade Stalin—who consider ideological work to be of particular significance—cadres in various departments of our country have undergone valuable Leninist training. The Party follows Lenin's behests, giving great attention to educating the Soviet people with socialist ideas, providing them with political training, raising their Marxist-Leninist consciousness, and arming them in the struggle against bourgeois ideology hostile to Leninism.

    The stipulation that advanced social thought possesses a great mobilizing, organizing, and transforming power is a great achievement of Leninism. In his early works, Lenin comprehensively expounded the role of thought in social life, in the practical activities of the working class, and in its struggle for the revolutionary transformation of society. Vladimir Ilyich pointed out the complete falsity and groundlessness of the bourgeois objectivists' assertion that there exists non-class thought, exposing them as spokesmen for the bourgeoisie: "The question can only be like this: bourgeois ideology or socialist ideology. There is no middle road here (because humanity has not produced any 'third' ideology, and in general, in a society divided by class contradictions, there can never be non-class or supra-class thought)."

    Lenin, proceeding from the fact that socio-political thought has a profound Party spirit, taught us to consciously stand on the side of the revolutionary working class. "Lack of Party spirit," he wrote, "is the ideology of the bourgeoisie. Party spirit is the ideology of socialism."

    From this, what conclusions should be drawn about practical activities? If there is no neutral, supra-class thought, then forgetting the necessity of educating workers in the spirit of Marxism under the conditions of capitalist society will result in them being captured by bourgeois ideology, the assertion about the "permanence" of capitalist slavery being the foundation of bourgeois ideology.

    Lenin, in his book "What Is To Be Done?" convincingly elucidated that only socialist ideology—the theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship being the foundation of socialist ideology—can guide the working class to complete liberation from exploitation.

    After emphasizing the paramount importance of scientific socialism for the victory of the proletarian class struggle and the significance of the Party as the conscious vanguard of the working class, Lenin instructed that without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary action, and only a political party guided by advanced theory can fulfill the role of an advanced fighter.

    The great and insurmountable strength of the Bolshevik Party lies in the fact that it is armed with the most advanced theory, embodying the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our era. The Party educates the working masses in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, bravely and confidently guiding them towards the victory of communism in our country.

    Lenin paid the most concentrated attention to the ideological education of Party cadres and revolutionary socialist intellectuals. He said, "The Party should constantly propagate proletarian ideology—the doctrine of scientific socialism, that is, Marxism—protect it from being distorted, and further develop it."

    Lenin's works themselves are first and foremost models of militant propaganda of Marxism, examples of an uncompromising attitude towards distorting Marxist science, and examples of creatively developing Marxist science.

    The crushing of reactionary Machism and the further elaboration of Marxist philosophy in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" can be taken as an outstanding example of concern for the ideological education of cadres. Lenin relentlessly opposed dogmatism and scholasticism, often regarding Marxism as a militant guide to action. "It is necessary to understand this indisputable truth, that Marxists should take into account the living life and the exact facts of reality, and not continue to adhere to yesterday's theory..." This instruction of Lenin's is of invaluable significance for the ideological education of our cadres.

    The working class, as an oppressed class under the conditions of capitalist slavery, cannot solve the problem of cultivating and ideologically educating the cultural and technical cadres necessary for the proletarian dictatorship. This task can only be truly raised and resolved after the proletariat seizes power, at which time, "breaking all resistance from the capitalists—not only military and political, but also ideological, the ideological being the most profound and the most powerful" is put on the agenda.

    It is not only necessary to transform the economy of society, but also to transform the spiritual outlook of the working people. Lenin taught that the younger generation should be cultivated to build a new life.

    The Party and the working class cannot treat the ideological direction of people's education impartially: "All arrangements for education," Lenin instructed, "...should be permeated with the spirit of the proletarian class struggle..."

    In order to place the cause of educating laborers on a new track, it is necessary to cultivate new intellectual cadres and give them ideological training. At the same time, it is necessary to ideologically rearm those old intellectual cadres who are already serving the proletariat.

    Vladimir Ilyich constantly treated the teacher cadres with great attention, believing that under the conditions of Soviet power, the people's teachers should be raised to a height they had never reached before. Lenin especially emphasized the necessity of ideological education for teachers. "Now, we should cultivate a new contingent of teachers, this new contingent should be closely linked with the Party, with the Party's ideology, should be imbued with the spirit of the Party, should attract the working masses to their side, educate them in the communist spirit, and make them concerned about becoming a communist."

    In one of his last essays (in essence his political testament), "Pages from a Diary," Lenin re-raised the issue of the ideological training and education of people's teacher cadres, instructing that they should be transformed from pillars of the capitalist system into pillars of the Soviet system.

    The Bolshevik Party resolutely implemented Lenin's instructions on teachers, caring for their education and cultivation. The Soviet people's teachers are a reliable force in our socialist intelligentsia and the entire army of laborers who are building communism.

    During the transition period from socialism to communism, the task of the communist education of the people requires arming cadres with Marxism-Leninism on a new and broader scale. The Party and Comrade Stalin himself have carried out enormous work in implementing Lenin's instructions on the ideological education of the Soviet intelligentsia (including Soviet teachers). The publication of Stalin's "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)' "Resolution on How to Carry Out Party Propaganda Work Due to the Publication of the 'History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course'" are landmarks of great significance in this cause. The Party has attracted millions of people to participate in the study of Leninist revolutionary theory, and to participate in the study of the Marxist-Leninist materialist science of the laws of natural and social development.

    The Lenin-Stalin Party tirelessly cares for the broad development of ideological work, with the aim that our cadres become cadres with Marxist cultivation and Bolshevik training. In this regard, the decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues and the articles published by our Party's organ, "Pravda," on exposing the anti-Soviet cosmopolitanism and nationalism that have appeared in literature and art, play a great role that cannot be re-evaluated.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and Comrade Stalin gave enormous help to our scholars and educators through discussions on philosophy, biology, and linguistics. These discussions showed that the conscious application of dialectical materialism by Soviet scientists opened up unprecedented prospects for scientific creation for them. Lybesinskaya, an outstanding Soviet scientific innovator, said on this issue: "Every scientific worker needs dialectical materialism as much as breathing needs air."

    Stalin's work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" is of great significance for the ideological education of scientific teacher cadres. Stalin's instruction that without disputes and freedom of criticism, no science can develop, pointed out the path to overcome outdated views and outdated theories in science, and pointed out the path to expel ideologically hostile views from science.

    Lenin's entire activity was a model of uncompromising and militant spirit on ideological issues. He cared for protecting cadres from the influence of non-proletarian ideas, and called on cadres to fight against reactionary and hostile ideas.

    Now, the issue of fighting against the ideology of American imperialism, poisoned by the poison of carrion, is particularly acute. At present, all ideological work in the United States is subordinate to one purpose—to justify the historically unheard-of acts of hatred of humanity by American aggressors and to deceive other nations in order to enslave them. The academic institutions of the United States are not led by true scholars, but by pure warmongers. The president of Columbia University, the largest university in the United States, is still General Eisenhower, whose scientific worth is sufficiently illustrated by the fact that, by his own admission, he has not finished reading a book in ten years.

    Why does an unlearned person need to occupy such a high scientific position?

    This can be seen clearly from the general's first speech at the university, in which he demanded "bloodshed, sacrifice, death," and threatened to fire those teachers who dared to promote philosophies hostile to "free enterprise."

    Exposing the corrupt and reactionary ideas of American war instigators is an urgent and important task of our ideological work.

    ×××

    The creative power of advanced social thought—the thought of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin—is great.

    The glorious obligation of instilling these ideas in the broad masses of the Soviet people and educating the growing generation in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and loyalty to the Lenin-Stalin Party falls on the Soviet intelligentsia (including Soviet teachers). In order to successfully solve this task, implementing Lenin's instructions on the ideological education of intellectual cadres is of great significance.

    列宁论干部的思想教育
    苏联  康德拉基也夫
    共产党和斯大林同志以列宁的英明思想教育我们的干部。在布尔什维克党和斯大林同志——他们认为思想工作具有特殊的意义——的领导下，我们国家各工作部门的干部经受了宝贵的列宁主义的锻炼。党遵循着列宁的遗训，而给予极大的注意去以社会主义思想教育苏联人民，给他们以政治上的锻炼，提高他们的马克思—列宁主义的觉悟性，在和敌对列宁主义的资产阶级思想的斗争中武装他们。
    关于先进的社会思想具有伟大的动员、组织和改造力量的问题的规定，是列宁主义的巨大功绩。列宁在他早期的著作中，就全面地阐发了思想在社会生活中、在工人阶级的实践活动及其为社会的革命改造的斗争中的作用。弗拉基米尔·伊里奇指出资产阶级客观主义者关于存在着非阶级的思想的论断的全部虚伪性和毫无根据，揭露出他们是资产阶级的代言人：“问题只能是这样：资产阶级思想或者是社会主义思想。这里没有中间道路（因为人类没有产生出任何‘第三种’思想，而且一般地在为阶级矛盾所分裂了的社会里，永远也不可能有非阶级的或超阶级的思想）。”
    列宁从社会政治思想具有深刻的党性一事实出发，教导我们自觉地站在革命的工人阶级方面。“无党性，——他写道——，是资产阶级的思想。党性是社会主义的思想。”
    由此，关于实践活动应该得出什么样的结论来呢？如果没有中立的、超阶级的思想，那末，在资本主义社会条件下忘记了以马克思主义精神教育工人的必要性，结果便会使他们为资产阶级思想所俘掳，关于资本主义奴隶制的“永久性”的断言是资产阶级思想的基础。
    列宁在其所著“做什么？”中具有说服力地阐明了：只有社会主义思想——关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的理论是社会主义思想的基础——，能够引导工人阶级从剥削中得到完全解放。
    列宁在强调说明科学的社会主义对于无产阶级阶级斗争的胜利具有头等重要性，和党作为工人阶级的觉悟的先锋队的意义以后，他指示说，没有革命的理论，就不可能有革命的行动，只有受先进理论所指导的政党，才能实现先进战士的作用。
    布尔什维克党的伟大的不可克服的力量，就在于它是为最先进的理论所武装着，体现着我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心。党以马克思列宁主义的精神教育劳动群众，勇敢地、满怀信心地引导他们走向我国共产主义的胜利。
    列宁对于党的干部和革命的社会主义知识分子的思想教育问题，给予最集中的注意。他说，“党应当经常宣传无产阶级思想——科学的社会主义学说，也即马克思主义——，保护它使之不被歪曲，并进一步发展它。”
    列宁的著作本身首先就是关于马克思主义的战斗性的宣传的范例，对曲解马克思主义科学采取不调和态度的范例，也是创造性地发展马克思主义科学的范例。
    在“唯物论与经验批判论”一书中，反动的马赫主义之被粉碎和对马克思主义哲学的进一步阐发，可以作为关怀干部的思想教育的卓越的典型。列宁无情地反对教条主义和学究习气，常常把马克思主义看作行动的战斗性的指南。“必须懂得这一不可争辩的真理，即马克思主义者应当顾及到活生生的生活和现实的确切的事实，而不继续墨守昨天的理论……”。列宁的这一指示对于我们干部的思想教育具有宝贵的意义。
    工人阶级在资本主义奴隶制社会条件下是被压迫的阶级，不能够解决为无产阶级专政所必需的文化技术干部的培养和思想教育的问题。这个任务，只有在无产阶级取得政权以后，才能真正提出和得到解决，这时候，必须“打破资本家的一切反抗——不仅是军事上的和政治上的，而且还有思想上的，思想上的是最深刻的和最强大的”，已提到日程上来了。
    不仅需要改造社会的经济，而且必须改造劳动人民的精神面貌。列宁教导说，应当培养年青的一代去建设新生活。
    党和工人阶级不能毫无偏袒地对待人民教育的思想方针：“教育事业的一切安排，——列宁指示说，——……都应当渗透着无产阶级阶级斗争的精神……。”
    为要把对劳动者的教育事业安置在新的轨道上，必须培养新的知识分子干部，在思想上给他们以锻炼。同时，必须从思想上再武装那些已在为无产阶级服务的那些旧知识分子干部。
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇经常以极大的注意对待教师干部，他认为，在苏维埃政权条件下，人民教师应该提高到他从来还没有达到过的高度。列宁特别强调对教师的思想教育的必要性。“现在，我们应当培养一支新的师资人员的队伍，这支新的队伍应当和党、和党的思想密切联系，应当浸透着党的精神，应当把工人群众吸引到自己方面来，以共产主义精神教育他们，使他们关心于成为一个共产主义者。”
    列宁在其死前的一篇论文（实质上是他的政治遗嘱）“日记几则”中，重新提出了人民教师干部的思想锻炼和思想教育的问题，他指示说，应当把他们从资本主义制度的支柱改变成苏维埃制度的支柱。
    布尔什维克党坚决地实现了列宁关于教师的指示，关心地教育和培养他们。苏联的人民教师是我们的社会主义知识分子和正在建设共产主义的整个劳动者大军的一支可靠的部队。
    ×××
    在从社会主义到共产主义的过渡时期，对人民的共产主义教育的任务要求以马克思—列宁主义武装干部具有新的、更广泛的规模。党和斯大林同志本人在实现列宁关于对苏维埃知识分子（其中包括苏维埃教师）进行思想教育的指示方面，进行了巨大的工作。斯大林的“联共（布）党史简明教程”的出版和联共（布）中央“关于因‘联共（布）党史简明教程’出版而应如何进行党的宣传工作的决议”，在这一事业中是具有重要意义的标志。党吸引了数百万人参加列宁主义的革命理论的研究，参加关于自然和社会发展规律的马克思—列宁主义的唯物主义科学的研究。
    列宁—斯大林的党不倦地关心着思想工作的广阔发展，以期我们的干部成为具有马克思主义的教养和布尔什维克的锻炼的干部。在这一点上，联共
    （布）党中央关于思想问题的决定和我党机关报——“真理报”所发表的关于揭露在文学和艺术中出现的敌视苏联人的世界主义和民族主义表现的文章，它们所起的伟大作用是难以重新估价的。
    联共（布）党中央和斯大林同志通过关于哲学、生物学和语言学问题的讨论，给予我们的学者和教育家以巨大的帮助。这些讨论表明，苏维埃科学家对于辩证唯物主义的自觉的运用，给他们打开了科学创造的空前的远景。卓越的苏维埃科学革新者列别森斯卡娅关于这一问题说道：“每一个科学工作者之需要辩证唯物主义，就如同呼吸需要空气一样。”
    斯大林的著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”对于科学教师干部的思想教育具有重大意义。斯大林关于没有意见的争论和批评自由，任何科学都不会有发展的指示，指出了克服科学中的陈旧观点和陈旧理论的道路，指出了从科学中驱逐在思想上敌对我们的观点的道路。
    列宁的全部活动是在思想问题上的不调和性和战斗性的典范。他关心地保护干部免受非无产阶级思想的影响，号召干部同反动的、敌对的思想作斗争。
    现在，同美帝国主义的为腐尸的毒所毒化的思想作斗争的问题是特别尖锐的。目前，美国的一切思想工作都服从于一个目的——为历史上所没有听见过的美国侵略者的仇恨人类的行为作辩护和欺骗其他民族以便奴役他们。美国的学术机关不是由真正的学者领导，而是由纯粹的战争贩子领导的。美国最大的大学哥伦比亚大学校长至今仍是艾森豪威尔将军，他的科学身价由以下事实足以说明：据他自己承认，十年来没有读完过一本书。
    为什么需要一个不学无识的人占据这样高的科学地位呢？
    这可从将军在该大学的第一次讲话中看得清楚，在讲话中他要求“流血、牺牲、死亡”，并以解雇来威胁那些敢于宣传敌视“自由经营”的哲学的教师。
    揭露美国战争挑拨者的腐朽的、反动的思想，是我们的思想工作的迫切的和重要的任务。
    ×××
    先进的社会思想——马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的思想的创造的力量是伟大的。
    在广大的苏维埃人民群众中灌输这些思想和以苏维埃爱国主义精神、以忠诚于列宁——斯大林党的精神教育正在成长的一代的光荣义务，落在苏维埃知识分子（其中包括苏维埃教师）的身上。为了顺利地解决这一任务，实现列宁关于对知识分子干部进行思想教育的指示具有巨大的意义。
