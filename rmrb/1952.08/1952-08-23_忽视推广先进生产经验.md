    Ignoring the Promotion of Advanced Production Experience
    To the Editor: We are workers from the 152nd Production Team of the First Mine of the Jingxing Coal Mine. In June of this year, the mine sent technician Pei Dekang to lead us to Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong to learn advanced coal mining methods for thin coal seams. When we returned and conveyed this to the workers in our team, everyone was very enthusiastic and said, "Now we have a solution! The Hongshan Coal Mine completes two cycles of extraction per day, and we must strive to achieve three cycles." So we improved the electric "liuzi" (coal transport tool) that was not working well in the past, made all preparations, and began to experiment with the new method of coal mining on July 16th. The first day's results were very good, reaching three cycles. Each worker produced 2.8 tons of coal, which is double the efficiency of the past. If the relevant departments can pay attention to and support us, the productivity can be further improved. But the reality is not like this. We encountered many difficulties, and the relevant personnel did not resolve them. For example, the roof of our mine is very bad and requires many props, but the mine does not adequately supply us with them. Even for eight days from July 18th to 25th, we were not issued a single new prop. We had no choice but to dismantle old props for use, which led to a near-collapse accident on July 27th. After everyone's courageous rescue, the situation was turned from danger to safety. Afterwards, Mine Director Song Yusheng only asked, "Did it collapse?" He didn't mention the issue of props at all.
    Our production has increased, but there are not enough coal trucks. The coal is piled up at the working face and cannot be transported out, so production cannot continue. In order to solve this problem, Gao Migui went to the main roadway to find Section Chief Han Fengshan of the Third District to ask for trucks. Section Chief Han not only did not solve the problem, but criticized Gao Migui, "Who told you to crawl out?" Until now, coal trucks are still not supplied normally.
    We are using highly efficient Soviet coal cutting machines. He Fengshu, chief of the Mechanical and Electrical Section, did not study the machine's performance and subjectively told the driving workers, "This kind of coal cutting machine is easy to burn out and cannot be driven fast." Therefore, a shift only dares to cut 20 to 30 meters. After our research, we have increased it to 50 meters. Even so, it is still far from the actual efficiency of the machine. Because the leading cadres do not solve the wind pipe problem, the pneumatic picks cannot be used, and we still use hand picks to dig coal feet. The workers said, "Complete mechanized coal mining, why are we still using this clumsy thing?"
    The workers in our team have a common desire—to successfully test the advanced production methods of the Hongshan Coal Mine and then promote them to all work teams in the mine. However, the relevant personnel do not pay attention, and our enthusiasm and strength cannot be brought into play. We demand that they quickly change this conservative work attitude.

### 忽视推广先进生产经验

    忽视推广先进生产经验
    编辑同志：我们是井陉煤矿第一矿一五二生产小组的工人。今年六月，矿方派技术员裴德康领我们到山东洪山煤矿学习薄煤层的先进采煤法。我们回来向小组工人传达时，大伙非常起劲地说：“这一下可有办法了！洪山煤矿一天回采两循环，我们要争取做到三循环。”于是我们改进了过去不好使唤的电镏子（运煤工具），做好一切准备，在七月十六日开始试验新法采煤。第一天成绩很好，达到了三循环。每工产煤二点八吨，比过去的工作效率提高了一倍。如果有关部门能够重视并支持我们，生产率还可以再提高。但事实不是这样，我们遇到很多困难，有关人员并不给解决。例如，我们矿的顶板很坏，需要很多支柱，但矿上并不充分供给我们。甚至从七月十八日到二十五日的八天中，没有发给我们一根新支柱。我们没法子，只好拆旧支柱应用，以致在七月二十七日几乎发生塌顶事故，经大伙奋不顾身的抢救，才转危为安。事后，宋玉生矿长只问了一句：“塌了没有？”对支柱问题只字不提。
    我们生产提高了，运煤车不够用。煤堆在工作面运不出去，就不能继续生产。为了解决这个问题，高米贵到大巷找三区区长韩凤山要车。韩区长不但不解决问题，却批评高米贵：“谁叫你爬出来的？”直到现在煤车还是不能正常供应。
    我们用的是效率很高的苏联割煤机。机电股长何凤书不研究机器的性能，就主观地对开车工人说：“这种割煤机容易烧坏，不能开快。”因此，一班只敢割二十米到三十米。经我们研究后，已提高到五十米。就是这样，距机器的实际效能还很远。因为领导干部不解决风管，放着风镐不能使用，我们仍然使手镐挖煤脚。工人们说：“全部机械化采煤，为啥还让我们用这个笨家伙？”
    我们小组的工人都有一个共同的愿望——把洪山煤矿的先进生产方法试验成功，然后推广到全矿各工作组去。可是，有关人员并不重视，我们的热情和力量也就不能发挥。我们要求他们迅速改变这种保守主义的工作态度。
