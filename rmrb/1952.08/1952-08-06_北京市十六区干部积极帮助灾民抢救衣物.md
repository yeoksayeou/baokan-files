    Cadres in Sixteen Districts of Beijing Actively Help Disaster Victims Rescue Clothing
    Editor: Mentougou, in the sixteen districts of Beijing, suffered a rainstorm on July 21st. Even the steel-reinforced concrete telephone poles were knocked down, and more than 500 houses were damaged, with streets temporarily submerged in water.

    The flood caused by the rainstorm inflicted considerable losses on the masses, but there were no casualties among the disaster victims. The reason for this was that all the cadres and activists from various government departments, streets, and villages in the entire district were mobilized to help the masses in the rescue efforts. For example, the four cadres of the Dongxinfang Street Government, along with the cadres and police officers from the police station, led the activists of the entire street to rescue all the furniture and clothing from more than 100 houses that were flooded and about to collapse within two hours. At that time, many district and village cadres displayed a high degree of self-sacrifice. District cadre Fu Wanxin and correspondent Ma Yubao risked their lives to rescue an old man from the river. CPC District Committee cadre Li Chunming and correspondent Li Zhengyong also braved the heavy rain to rescue disaster victims from the river. Many similar events occurred. Many disaster victims are talking about it: "In the past, when natural disasters struck, who cared about life or death? Now, there is rescue, condolences, and resettlement. The cadres are truly serving the people! If it weren't for them, we would have been washed away by the water." Li Hui

    北京市十六区干部积极帮助灾民抢救衣物
    编辑同志：北京市十六区门头沟在七月二十一日遭了一场暴雨，钢骨水泥的电线杆子都被冲倒了，被冲坏房屋五百多间，街道一时浸在水里。
    这场暴雨酿成的水灾，给群众造成相当大的损失，但灾民无一伤亡。原因是全区各机关、各街村干部和积极分子，当时全体动员，帮助群众抢险。例如，东辛房街政府的四个干部，和派出所的干部和警士，带领全街积极分子，在两小时内从一百多间被水淹住快要倒塌的房屋里，抢救出全部家具和衣物。当时许多区村干部表现了高度的自我牺牲精神。区干部傅万信、通讯员马玉保舍身到河里抢救了一个老汉。中共区委员会干部李春明、通讯员李正永也都冒着大雨，到河里抢救灾民。像这样的事，出现了很多。许多灾民都在谈论：“过去闹天灾，谁来管死活？如今又是抢救，又是慰问，又是安置，干部真是为人民服务呀！要没有他们，我们怕都给水冲走了”。李辉
