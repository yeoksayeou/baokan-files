    Oppose the American Plot to Plan a Pacific Aggression Organization

    The United States is stepping up its aggression in the Pacific region. At the end of last month, the United States and the Japanese Yoshida government signed a military base agreement and announced the continuation of stationing troops in Japan. Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson held the first meeting of the so-called "ANZUS Council" with the foreign ministers of Australia and New Zealand in Honolulu. The purpose of the United States in convening the Honolulu meeting was to consolidate the aggressive ANZUS "Three-Nation Security Treaty" and prepare to use this as a basis to combine the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and the US-Philippines "Mutual Defense Treaty" to expand the "Pacific Pact" similar to the "North Atlantic Treaty."

    However, this American aggression plan has encountered serious and complex difficulties. First of all, the people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific region resolutely oppose this organization that threatens peace. No matter what banner of "defense" or "security" the United States is waving, its aggressive conspiracy has long been seen through by the people of all countries. Especially in countries that have signed military treaties with the United States, the people's opposition is even stronger because their national sovereignty is being infringed upon by the United States. Secondly, important Asian countries such as India, Burma, and Indonesia have refused to participate in this aggressive organization of the United States. The British "Times" also said that "without their participation, the Pacific Pact would be difficult to live up to its name." Third, the United States must bring Japan and the Philippines into the Pacific Pact. Because Japan is the main base and center of aggression for the United States in the Far East. However, this has aroused the concerns of Australia. Countries that suffered greatly from Japanese occupation and war threats during World War II cannot but worry about the resurgence of Japanese militarism. This situation was clearly demonstrated at the meeting. According to Agence France-Presse, on the issue of rearming Japan, Australia succumbed to the United States on the one hand and "urged the United States to act with extreme caution" on the other.

    In the process of planning to establish a Pacific aggression organization, the United States has always cast Britain aside, and Britain did not participate in this meeting. This shows that the United States is doing its best to exclude British forces in the Pacific and Far East regions. And in fact, the ANZUS "Three-Nation Security Treaty" has separated Australia and New Zealand, Britain's largest autonomous territories in the Far East, further from Britain and pulled them into the arms of the United States. The result of the United States' intensified planning of the Pacific Pact has also deepened the contradictions between the United States and Britain in the Pacific.

    The Chinese people and the people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific region are seriously vigilant about the United States' aggressive activities and war conspiracies. We resolutely oppose the aggressive ANZUS "Three-Nation Security Treaty" and any aggressive treaty. We believe that with the rising tide of the peace movement in Asian and Pacific countries, the American conspiracy will eventually go bankrupt, and the struggle for peace by the people of Asian and Pacific countries will eventually be victorious.

### 反对美国策划太平洋侵略组织的阴谋

    反对美国策划太平洋侵略组织的阴谋
    美国正在太平洋地区加紧进行侵略活动。上月底，美国和日本吉田政府签订了军事基地协定，并宣布继续驻军日本。本月初，美国国务卿艾奇逊又和澳大利亚与新西兰外长，在檀香山举行了所谓“澳、新、美理事会”第一届会议。美国召集檀香山会议的目的，是为了巩固侵略性的美澳新“三国安全条约”，并准备以此为基础，结合美日“安全条约”和美菲“联防条约”，扩大类似“北大西洋公约”的“太平洋公约”。
    但是美国这一侵略计划遭到了严重的和复杂的困难。首先，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民都坚决反对这种威胁和平的组织。不论美国打着什么“防御”或“安全”的招牌，美国的侵略阴谋是早已被各国人民看穿了。特别是在和美国签订了军事条约的国家，由于他们的国家主权被美国所侵害，人民的反对更加强烈。其次，亚洲的重要国家像印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等都拒绝参加美国的这一侵略性的组织。英国的“泰晤士报”也说，“没有它们的参加，太平洋公约是很难名符其实的”。第三，美国要建立太平洋公约就一定要把日本和菲律宾拉进去。因为日本是美国在远东的主要基地和侵略中心。然而这却引起了澳大利亚的疑虑。在第二次世界大战中曾备受日本占领的痛苦和战争威胁的国家，不能不担心日本军国主义的再起。这种情况在这次会议上表现得很明显。据法新社称，关于重新武装日本问题，澳大利亚一方面向美国屈服，一方面又“促请美国极端审慎行事”。
    美国在策划建立太平洋侵略组织的活动中，一直把英国抛在一边，这次会议也没有英国参加。这说明了美国在太平洋及远东地区是极力排斥英国的势力的。并且事实上，美澳新“三国安全条约”已使英国在远东最大的自治领——澳大利亚与新西兰，和英国分离得更远，而被拉到美国的怀里去了。美国加紧策划太平洋公约的结果，也使美英在太平洋的矛盾日益加深了。
    中国人民和亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民，正严重警惕着美国的侵略活动和战争阴谋，我们坚决反对侵略性的美澳新“三国安全条约”以及任何侵略性的条约。我们相信，在亚洲及太平洋区域各国的和平运动日益高涨的形势下，美国的阴谋诡计终将破产，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民为和平而进行的斗争终将得到胜利。
