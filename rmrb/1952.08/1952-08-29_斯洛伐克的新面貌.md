    The New Face of Slovakia
    Today in 1944, under the leadership of the Slovak Communist Party, the Slovak people launched an armed uprising against the German fascist occupiers, delivering a serious blow to the collapsing Hitler bandits. The patriotic heroes who participated in the uprising persisted in their struggle behind enemy lines until the glorious Soviet army liberated the entire territory of Czechoslovakia in May 1945.

    Since liberation, Slovakia has been changing its face by leaps and bounds; this formerly backward and impoverished agricultural region is now rapidly transforming into one of the industrial centers of Czechoslovakia.

    Before liberation, one-third of the Slovak population lived in inhumane conditions; unemployment plagued the working people, and hundreds of thousands were forced to wander abroad because they could not find jobs; due to poverty and oppression, the mortality rate of the people was shockingly high. However, all these ugly phenomena of the bourgeois-landlord rule have now been rapidly eliminated. Factories have been returned to the people, farmers have received land, new industrial cities have replaced remote and backward rural areas, and the popularization of culture and education has freed people from ignorance forever.

    The speed of Slovakia's industrial development is astonishing. At the end of 1951, Slovakia's industrial production was already three and a half times that of pre-war 1937, and it will increase by another 26 percent this year. The increase in industrial output this year alone is equal to its total production in 1937. The increase in heavy industrial output is even more significant, reaching six and a half times the pre-war level by the end of this year. In recent years, Slovakia has established 68 large-scale new factories; in addition, 39 factories will be completed this year, and 50 factories and workshops will be greatly expanded and modernized. Construction projects of particular importance for the development of Slovak industry are the "Huko" steel plant being built near Košice, the large hydroelectric power station on the Váh River, and the large water gate in the Orava Valley. When the "Huko" steel plant is fully completed in 1955, Slovakia's steel production, calculated by population ratio, will exceed that of the major capitalist country of Great Britain. In 1955, Czechoslovakia's steel production will jump to sixth place in the world. After the completion of the large hydroelectric power station on the Váh River, it will greatly increase Czechoslovakia's power generation. By 1955, Slovakia's power generation will be equal to the total power generation of the entire Czechoslovakia in pre-war 1937.

    Before liberation, Slovakia's agriculture was backward, and most of the land was controlled by churches, nobles, and landlords. Now, agricultural production cooperatives have been established one after another, and thousands of tractors and seeders have brought rich harvests to the land. Because farmers have realized the superiority of agricultural collectivization, they have voluntarily joined agricultural cooperatives. Slovakia now has nearly a thousand higher-level cooperatives, owning more than a quarter of all arable land.

    Economic development has created unlimited possibilities for full employment and improved living standards for the working people of Slovakia; those who were forced to wander abroad for a living in the past have now returned to their hometowns with excitement and joy to participate in the construction of their motherland. Workers' wages in 1950 were 73 percent higher than in 1937. The improvement of living conditions has reduced the mortality rate by 18 percent, while the birth rate has increased by 27 percent.

    The improvement of economic life has created conditions for the development of cultural undertakings. Illiteracy has been eliminated throughout the region; the circulation of books and periodicals has increased tenfold or twentyfold compared with the past. Thousands of young people have gained access to education, and the number of students in universities and technical schools is increasing rapidly. In 1938, Slovakia had only one university; now the number of universities has increased to seven; originally, the number of people studying in industrial and agricultural technical schools was only 68, but now it has increased to 5,000, and will reach 16,000 in 1955. A huge modern industrial technical college is now under construction in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Other cultural, educational, and welfare institutions such as libraries, cinemas, theaters, hospitals, and nurseries are also increasing rapidly.

    Under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and with the enthusiastic help of the Czech people, the Slovak people have made significant achievements in various constructions. The speed of Slovakia's industrial development is rare in the world, and it will rapidly become one of the most advanced industrial regions in the world.

    斯洛伐克的新面貌
    一九四四年的今天，斯洛伐克人民在斯洛伐克共产党的领导之下，举行了反抗德国法西斯占领者的武装起义，给濒临崩溃的希特勒匪徒以严重的打击。参加起义的爱国志士们一直在敌后坚持斗争，直到一九四五年五月光荣的苏军解放了捷克斯洛伐克全境。
    解放以来，斯洛伐克飞跃地改变着自己的面貌；这个原来十分落后贫困的农业地区，现在正在迅速地转变为捷克斯洛伐克的工业中心之一了。
    解放以前，斯洛伐克三分之一的人口生活在非人的境遇中；失业伴随着劳动人民，数十万人因为找不到职业而被迫流浪国外；由于贫困和压迫，人民的死亡率高得惊人。但是，这一切资产阶级——大地主统治时期的丑恶现象，现在已被迅速地清除了。工厂还给了人民，农民得到了土地，新的工业城市代替了偏僻落后的农村，文化、教育的普及，使人们永远摆脱了愚昧无知的状态。
    斯洛伐克工业发展的速度是惊人的。在一九五一年年底，斯洛伐克的工业生产量已等于战前一九三七年的三倍半，今年又将增加百分之二十六。仅仅今年工业增加的数量，就等于它在一九三七年全年的生产量。重工业产量的增加更加显著，到今年年底，将等于战前的六倍半。数年来，斯洛伐克已建立起六十八个规模巨大的新工厂，另外，三十九个工厂将在今年完工，五十个工厂与车间将要大加扩充与现代化。对于发展斯洛伐克工业具有特别重要意义的建设工程，是正在科息斯附近建设的“胡科”大钢铁厂、伐河上的大水电站与奥拉伐山谷中的大水闸。当“胡科”钢铁厂在一九五五年全部完工以后，斯洛伐克的钢产量，如以人口比例计算，将超过主要的资本主义国家英国。一九五五年，捷克斯洛伐克的钢铁生产量，将跃居于世界的第六位。伐河上的大水电站建造完成后，将大大地增加捷克斯洛伐克的发电量，到一九五五年斯洛伐克的发电量将等于战前一九三七年捷克斯洛伐克全国的发电量。
    解放以前，斯洛伐克的农业是落后的，大部分土地掌握在教堂、贵族与地主手中。现在，农业生产合作社已一个个地建立起来，成千架的拖拉机、播种机给土地带来了丰收。由于农民认识到了农业集体化的优越性，他们都自愿地加入了农业合作社，斯洛伐克现在有将近一千个较高形态的合作社，拥有全部可耕地的四分之一以上。
    经济的发展，为斯洛伐克的劳动人民创造了充分就业与提高生活水平的无限可能；从前为了生活被迫流浪国外的人，现在已带着兴奋、喜悦的心情重返故乡，参加祖国的建设工作。工人的工资在一九五○年就比一九三七年提高了百分之七十三。生活条件的改善，使人口的死亡率降低了百分之十八，而出生率则增加了百分之二十七。
    经济生活的改善，给文化事业的发展创造了条件。全境文盲已被扫除；书刊的发行量比从前增加了一、二十倍。成千的青年获得了就学的机会，大学和技术学校的学生人数迅速增加着。在一九三八年，斯洛伐克只有一所大学，现在大学已增为七所；原来在工农业技术学校中学习的人数只有六十八名，现在已增为五千人，并且将在一九五五年达到一万六千人。在斯洛伐克的首府布拉的斯拉发，现在正在建设一所巨大的现代化的工业技术学院。其他如图书馆、影剧院、医院、托儿所等文教福利机构也正在迅速增加。
    在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导与捷克人民的热情帮助之下，斯洛伐克人民在各种建设上已经取得了重大的成就。斯洛伐克工业发展的速度在世界上是罕见的，它将迅速地成为世界上最先进的工业地区之一。
