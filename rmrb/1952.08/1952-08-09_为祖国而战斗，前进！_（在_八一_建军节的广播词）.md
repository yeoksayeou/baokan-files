Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force Combat Hero Liu Yuti:

Respected leaders, comrades of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Ground, Naval, and Air Forces, fellow countrymen:

I am extremely happy and honored to represent the Volunteer Army Air Force in returning to the motherland to visit the PLA's 25th Anniversary Sports Meet and to celebrate the founding anniversary of our great motherland's protector – the PLA – together with the people of the motherland. This honor belongs to Chairman Mao, to all comrades of the Volunteer Air Force, to all comrades of the Volunteer Army, and to all the people of the country. Comrades, our Volunteer Air Force asked me to tell you that although they cannot personally fly here to congratulate you, they will create new victories in Korea to celebrate the great festival of the PLA.

On the Korean front, I shot down and damaged seven enemy aircraft, including the Sabre jets boasted by U.S. imperialism. Although this is only the beginning of victory, the initial victory of our Volunteer Air Force has severely struck the enemy, and they no longer dare to flaunt their power on the Korean battlefield. What force enabled our young Volunteer Air Force to defeat the so-called "powerful" U.S. Air Force and achieve victory? Comrades, the main thing is our hatred of imperialism and our love for the motherland and peace. I joined the revolution in my teens and witnessed the Japanese imperialist planes strafing my beloved comrades and compatriots, bombing the cities and villages of the motherland, and my heart was filled with hatred. I remembered this hatred and made up my mind that if I had the chance in the future, I would become an air force pilot to severely punish these murderous aerial bandits. Under the nurturing of the Party for more than ten years, my dream came true. When the U.S. imperialist aerial bandits were destroying the peaceful villages of Korea and massacring the peaceful residents of Korea, I flew the planes donated by the people of the motherland across the Yalu River. Looking down from the air, the beautiful and free land of Korea was almost reduced to ashes. I felt both sad and angry. I thought of the motherland across the river, the vast territory of the motherland, the hardworking and brave people, and her history of many disasters. We have personally defended her, shed blood and sweat for her, and contributed our fighting youth. Now the people of the motherland are carrying out construction in various fields under the leadership of Chairman Mao. I will never allow any imperialism to invade our great motherland again. If that imperialism dares to invade it, we will beat it hard and resolutely annihilate it.

That's how my fighting courage and determination came about. Once, when we set out for battle, we found enemy planes, and we asked the superiors for instructions and then tracked them down. While we were chasing, there was a peaceful Korean village in front of me, green trees surrounded white houses, which looked very beautiful, but in a blink of an eye, it was billowing with smoke. I knew that this was another blood debt owed to the people by the American aerial bandits, and the new and old hatred aroused my anger. My heart felt like it was being cut with a knife, and I immediately aimed the nose of the plane at the target, chased after it and bit it tightly, and I had to shoot it down, so that the Korean people could see with their own eyes the fate of the American plane that destroyed their village. Comrades, the enemy is brutal and fierce to the bare-handed people of Korea, but when they encounter our Volunteer Air Force fighters, they are timid and afraid of death. As soon as the enemy plane saw me, it fled in panic. I chased it tightly and didn't let go, all the way to the sea. I hit it hard with a few cannons. The enemy plane caught fire and received its due punishment. When I returned to the land, I found that there were enemy planes bombing the railway again. I felt even more uncomfortable, feeling that I had not done a good job in completing the task entrusted to me by the motherland and the Korean people. Why were the enemy planes still wantonly destroying there? A higher sense of responsibility and hatred made me bravely rush down with the team again, and shot down another enemy plane. Later, on the way back, I suddenly found sixty or seventy enemy planes hovering over the bay, probably preparing to wait for us to return and then return to throw bombs, or wanting to regroup and return. The victorious belief of shooting down two enemy planes encouraged me, and I must not watch these beasts go to bomb the land of Korea again, nor can I let them fly back neatly. I aimed at a pair of twin planes, rushed down, and when I reached the firing range, the enemy planes fled in panic. I fired at one of them and shot down another one. Just as all the enemy planes gathered to surround me, I pulled the control stick and flew high into the clouds and safely returned to the base.

Our battle in Korea is to defend peace and to defend the happiness of the next generation. Therefore, this year on "June 1st," in order to celebrate the happiness of the children of the motherland, the troops sent me back to the country amidst frequent battles to celebrate their festival with the children. In Beihai Park, the children tightly surrounded me and asked me to tell combat stories. In other places, the children warmly gave me red scarves, airplane models, and their most beloved things. Medals filled my chest. A six-year-old child, Zhang Mao Mao, gave me a small handkerchief with the words Zhang Mao Mao written crookedly on it. This was probably the first time she had written Chinese characters. Many children wrote letters and poems to me. Hou Jinghui, a member of the Juvenile Pioneer Team of Sifabu Street Elementary School, wrote in a poem to me: "Uncle, don't worry, I want to be Chairman Mao's good child now, and I want to be Chairman Mao's good fighter in the future, to defend the great motherland, to defend Chairman Mao, to defend you, the hero! I want to be ready at all times!" The noble and enthusiastic feelings of the children of New China deeply moved me. For these children, I vowed to fight a hundred times harder and never let disaster befall our lovely children. When I was with the children, they innocently and kindly told me their future wishes: some wanted to be engineers, some wanted to be writers, some wanted to be people's teachers, some wanted to be doctors... more wanted to be pilots, to fly with me in the sky of the motherland and defend the sky of the motherland. I said to them: Children, as long as you work hard, all these ideals can be realized in the Mao Zedong era. I will definitely fight to realize these ideals for you.

During my return to the motherland this time, when I arrived at the Beijing Railway Station, I was once again warmly welcomed by the people. From the East Station to the Temple of Heaven, it took us two and a half hours. The children embraced and kissed me even more affectionately. The young people lifted us up and ran all the way to the Temple of Heaven. What can explain the people's love for us? Because the people trust that we can protect their peaceful and happy lives, so that they can concentrate on building the motherland; because the people trust that we can severely strike the American aerial bandits, so that their labor can create the fruits of peaceful construction.

But what we have done is not enough. This time, when I returned to the country to visit the PLA's sports meet, the comrades gave me the task of humbly learning from the PLA's fine traditions and the advanced experience of training to become a modernized national defense force; and to bring the spirit of the conference back to the troops, so that every Volunteer Air Force comrade can more actively exercise, improve culture, and further master technology and tactics; at the same time, to convey the love and expectations of the people of the motherland to the comrades of the troops, so that they have more firm confidence and eliminate more American bandits. Comrades, I assure you: When we return to the front, we will definitely shoot down more enemy planes, so that the American aggressors will not dare to invade our motherland's airspace, and give the bandits who dare to invade our motherland the punishment they deserve. Compatriots, we assure you: We must defend you in the battle in Korea. You can study, work, and produce with peace of mind! We will resolutely complete the tasks entrusted to us by the people of the motherland. We will definitely achieve new and greater victories to answer your care and support for us.

Long live the great people of the motherland!
Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
Long live Chairman Mao! (Xinhua News Agency)

    为祖国而战斗，前进！
    （在“八一”建军节的广播词）
    中国人民志愿军空军战斗英雄  刘玉堤各位亲爱的首长，人民解放军陆、海、空军同志们，全国同胞们：
    我能够代表志愿军空军，回到祖国来参观人民解放军建军二十五周年的体育运动大会，和祖国人民一起来庆祝我们伟大祖国的保卫者——人民解放军的建军节日，感到十分的高兴和光荣。这光荣是属于毛主席、属于志愿空军全体同志，属于志愿军全体同志们，也是属于全国人民的。同志们，我们的志愿空军托我告诉你们，他们虽然不能亲自飞来祝贺你们，他们在朝鲜会创造新的胜利，来祝贺人民解放军的伟大节日。
    在朝鲜前线我打落、打伤了七架敌机，包括美帝国主义吹嘘的佩刀式在内。虽然，这仅仅是胜利的开始，但我们志愿空军初步的胜利已经沉重地打击了敌人，它在朝鲜战场上再也不敢任意耀武扬威。是什么力量使得我们年青的志愿空军打击了号称“强大”的美国空军取得胜利呢？同志们，主要的是我们对帝国主义的仇恨和对祖国、对和平的热爱。我在十几岁就参加革命，亲眼看到日本帝国主义的飞机扫射着自己亲爱的同志和同胞，轰炸着祖国的城市和农村，我的心里充满着仇恨。我记住了这些仇恨，打定了主意，在将来有机会一定要当一名空军驾驶员，来重重惩罚这些杀人的空中强盗。十多年来在党的培养之下我的梦想实现了。当美帝国主义空中强盗毁灭着朝鲜的和平村庄，屠杀着朝鲜的和平居民的时候，我驾驶着祖国人民捐献的飞机，飞过了鸭绿江。我从空中往下一望，美丽的自由的朝鲜土地几乎变成一片灰烬。我看了又难受又气愤。我想到隔一条江的祖国，祖国的广阔的国土，勤劳勇敢的人民和她的多灾难的历史。我们是亲手保卫过她、为着她流血、流汗，贡献了自己战斗的青春。现在祖国人民正在毛主席领导下进行各方面的建设。我绝不能允许任何帝国主义再来侵犯我们伟大的祖国。如果那个帝国主义敢来侵犯它，我们一定狠狠揍它，坚决歼灭它。
    我的战斗的勇气和决心，就是这样来的。有一次我们出发战斗，发现有敌机，我们请示了上级就跟踪追击。正在追着的时候，在我的前下方有一片朝鲜的和平村庄，绿的树围着白的屋，看上去非常美丽，但是它转眼间冒起了冲天的烟火。我知道这又是美国空中强盗欠人民的一笔血债，新仇旧债激起了我的愤怒，我的心好像刀割一样，立即把机头对准目标，追上去紧紧咬住它，非把它打下来不可，我要使朝鲜人民亲眼看到炸毁他们村庄的美国飞机的下场。同志们，敌人对待朝鲜赤手空拳的人民是残暴凶狠的；但碰到我们志愿空军战士却是胆怯的、怕死的。敌机一看到我，就仓皇逃跑。我紧紧追着它不放，一直追到海面上。我狠狠揍了它几炮。敌机着火了，受到它应有的惩罚。当我又回到陆地上空，发现又有敌机在轰炸铁路。我心里更难受，觉得我没有很好完成祖国和朝鲜人民委托给自己的任务，敌机为什么还在那里放肆破坏呢？更高的责任心和仇恨心使我带着队伍奋勇地又冲下去，又打掉了一架敌机。后来在归航的路上，突然又发现六七十架敌机在海湾上空盘旋着，大概是准备等我们回去以后再回到那边扔炸弹，或者想整队回航。击落了两架敌机的胜利信念鼓舞着我，我决不能眼望着它们这群野兽再去轰炸朝鲜的土地，也不能让它们整整齐齐飞回去。我看准一对双机，冲下去，到射击距离时，敌机仓皇逃跑了。我对准其中
    一架开火，又打落了一架。正当所有的敌机集拢来想包围我的时候，我一拉操纵杆，已经高飞到云层上面，安然回到基地了。
    我们在朝鲜的战斗，是为了保卫和平，为了保卫下一代的幸福。因此今年“六一”，为了庆贺祖国孩子的幸福，部队在频繁的战斗中派我回国和孩子们一起庆祝他们的节日。在北海公园，儿童们紧紧围住我，要我讲战斗故事。在其他的地方，儿童们热情地把红领巾、飞机模型，把他们最心爱的东西送给我。纪念章挂满了我的胸前。一个六岁的孩子张毛毛送我一块小手帕，上面歪歪斜斜写着张毛毛几个字，这恐怕是她第一次写出的中国字吧。许多孩子写信、写诗送给我。司法部街小学少年儿童队队员侯景慧送给我的诗上写着：“叔叔您放心，我现在要做毛主席的好儿童，将来要做毛主席的好战士，保卫伟大的祖国，保卫毛主席、保卫英雄的您！我要时刻准备着！”新中国儿童们这样崇高热烈的感情深深感动着我。为了这些孩子，我立誓要百倍努力地战斗，绝不能让灾难落到我们这些可爱的孩子们的头上。我和小朋友们在一起的时候，他们天真地亲切地告诉我他们将来的愿望：有的要当工程师，有的要当作家，有的要当人民教师，有的要当医生……更多的要当驾驶员，要和我一起飞翔在祖国的天空，保卫祖国的天空。我向他们说：小朋友，你们只要自己努力，所有这些理想在毛泽东时代都是可以实现的。我一定要为了你们实现这些理想而斗争。
    在我这次回到祖国，到达北京车站的时候，我又一次受到人民热烈的欢迎。从东车站到天坛，我们足足走了两个半钟头，小朋友们更亲热地抱着我，吻着我。青年们把我们抬了起来，一路跑着跟到天坛。用什么来解释人民对我们这样的热爱呢？因为人民信赖我们能够保卫他们和平幸福的生活，使他们集中精力建设祖国；因为人民信赖我们能够狠狠地打击美国空中强盗，使他们的劳动能够创造和平建设的成果。
    但我们做得还很不够。这次回国参观解放军全军体育运动大会，同志们给我的任务是要虚心学习人民解放军优良传统和锻炼成为现代化国防军的先进经验；并且要把大会的精神带回部队去，使每一个志愿空军同志更积极锻炼身体、提高文化，进一步掌握技术和战术；同时要把祖国人民对我们的热爱和期望传达给部队的同志，使他们有更坚强的信心，消灭更多的美国强盗。同志们，我向你们保证：回到前线，我们一定能够更多地击落敌机，使美国侵略者不敢侵略我们祖国的领空，给敢于侵略我们祖国的强盗们以应有的打击。同胞们，我们向你们保证：我们在朝鲜战斗，一定要保卫着你们。你们安心地学习、工作、生产吧！祖国人民托付给我们的任务，我们一定坚决完成。我们一定取得新的更大的胜利，来回答你们对我们的关怀与支援。
    伟大的祖国人民万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    毛主席万岁！（新华社）
