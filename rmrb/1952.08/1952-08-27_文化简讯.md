Central Ministry of Culture Establishes China Slide Company

Over the past two years, slides have played a significant role in propaganda and education among the masses, and they have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people across the country. In order to strengthen the promotion and leadership of slide work nationwide, improve the quality of slide projectors and slides, and enable them to play a greater role in propaganda and education, the Central People's Government Ministry of Culture formally established the China Slide Company on the 20th of this month.

The China Slide Company has been expanded on the basis of the Electro-Optical Education Tool Manufacturing Institute of the Social and Cultural Affairs Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture. In the past two years, it has produced 3,400 slide projectors, 7,000 sets of slide lenses, and 120 kinds of slides, distributing 49,000 sets of color printed slides and 46,000 rolls of filmstrips. However, on the one hand, due to the lack of manufacturing and printing equipment, the manufacturing of slide projectors and the printing of slides are mostly entrusted to private manufacturers, so the quality cannot be improved in a timely manner, which is far from meeting the urgent needs of the people across the country; on the other hand, because close ties have not been established with national slide manufacturing and propaganda institutions, the role of promoting and leading slide work nationwide has not been significant. These difficulties and shortcomings will be gradually overcome and corrected in the future.

    中央文化部成立中国幻灯公司
    两年来，幻灯片在群众中已起了重大的宣传教育作用，它受到全国广大群众的热烈欢迎。中央人民政府文化部为了加强今后对全国幻灯工作的推动和领导，提高幻灯机和幻灯片的质量，使它发挥更大的宣传教育作用，已在本月二十日正式成立了中国幻灯公司。
    中国幻灯公司是在中央文化部社会文化事业管理局电化教育工具制造所的基础上扩展起来的。两年来已出幻灯机三千四百架，幻灯镜头七千套，幻灯片一百二十种，发行彩色印刷片四万九千套，卷片四万六千卷。但是，一方面因为制机和印刷设备的缺乏，幻灯机的制造和幻灯片的印刷工作大部委托私营厂商，因此在质量上都不能及时提高，远远赶不上全国群众的迫切需要；同时在另一方面，因为和全国幻灯制造和宣传机构没有建立密切联系，因此对全国幻灯工作的推动和领导起的作用不大。今后将逐步克服和纠正这些困难和缺点。
