    The Cultural Advance of the Fourth Field Army Based on Accelerated Literacy
    Wu Ming
    After basically eliminating illiteracy, the Fourth Field Army issued the
    "Elementary School Chinese Teaching Implementation Plan." After strict placement tests, all participating cadres and soldiers were transferred to Chinese textbook teaching. Currently, 70 to 80 percent of the troops are continuing their studies in classes at or above the fourth grade of primary school (those with less than 1,000 characters, the semi-literate, only account for about 2 percent). After they have a sufficient foundation in Chinese, they will begin to study cultural and scientific knowledge such as arithmetic, nature, history, and geography (some units have already started teaching in this area).
    The Eighth Platoon, led by the famous training model Li Guofu, originally had mostly illiterate soldiers, and Li Guofu himself only knew 700 characters. Now, the entire platoon can not only read general books and newspapers but also write articles of several hundred characters. Their Chinese has reached the level of upper primary school. In a certain unit's machine gun company, the Li Shusen study group of five people originally had only one person who knew 300 single characters, while the others did not know a single character. However, after half a year of cultural studies, they are all second-year students in upper primary school in Chinese. The famous combat hero Li Wanyu, who had been awarded eight major and five minor merits, could not even write his own name completely when he participated in the National Combat Heroes Congress in 1950. Now, he is a student in the second grade of upper primary school. The Second Platoon of the Third Company of a certain unit, which he leads, was originally mostly illiterate. However, under the organization and leadership of Li Wanyu, most of the platoon has now reached the level of upper primary school. The eight people with the worst acceptance ability that Li Wanyu personally tutored are now all students above the fourth grade of elementary school. In a certain regiment, the illiterate, those with less than 1,000 characters, originally accounted for 84.7 percent, but now those who have reached the level of fourth grade of elementary school or above account for 78.7 percent of the total (the slightly poorer results are mostly due to official duties, transfers, sick leave, etc.).
    For several months, reading books and newspapers has become an indispensable part of the soldiers' lives. The soldiers accurately calculate the time when the People's Daily, the Soldier's Daily, Soldier's Life, and other newspapers and periodicals are delivered to their company. Many people spend most of their allowances on buying books. The soldiers of a certain unit's communications company subscribed to five newspapers themselves, and even the cooking squad subscribed to the People's Daily. When a certain unit's machine gun company elected a representative to go to Guangzhou to participate in the Third Cultural Teaching Congress, the soldiers of the entire company entrusted the representative to bring back books worth more than six million yuan. Li Guochuan, a member of the Youth League in a certain unit, bought eight books with his entire month's allowance after he had managed to learn more than 2,000 characters. Many party members have bought documents such as "On the Party" and "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists." The regimental library of a certain regiment has more than 2,000 books, which are often all borrowed. In a certain unit's Second Company, only two people in the entire company do not borrow books from the book group. Now, the windowsills, tables, and schoolbags in the soldiers' living quarters can no longer hold their books, and many platoons and squads have started to build their own bookshelves.
    Each company's club has become a small cultural center. The wall newspaper alone maintains more than 30 submissions every day, and sometimes (such as during festivals) it can reach 100 to 200 submissions. Every time a movie is watched, the wall newspaper is filled with articles expressing feelings about the movie the next day. Many units require that the wall newspaper submissions must be "three goods" – good content, good sentences, and good fonts – to be selected.
    What is even more exciting is that with the improvement of culture, various tasks in the troops have been significantly improved. Originally, eleven company commanders in a certain regiment could not read military teaching materials. Now, they can all prepare lesson plans before military classes, have outlines for speeches, take notes at meetings, and often use written reports. Tang Guilin, the deputy political instructor of a certain unit's communications company, originally only knew a few hundred characters and relied on his memory for everything, and others wrote on his behalf. Now, he can write work summaries with a beginning, an end, and clear content. Everyone takes turns taking minutes at each platoon and squad meeting. When evaluating models for the May Fourth Youth Day this year, most of the materials were organized by the platoons and squads themselves. The head of the cooking squad in a certain unit keeps a daily food report and writes a summary to the company headquarters every ten days. Currently, in order to consolidate the gains, many tasks are carried out in writing as much as possible. In this way, they improve their work through cultural learning and consolidate and develop the achievements they have learned in their work.
    The soldiers have broadened their horizons by reading a large number of books and newspapers. When they see the great construction of the motherland or the victory news from the Korean front in the books and newspapers, their excitement is like they have won a great victory themselves. Huang Shuixiang, a soldier in the Second Company of a certain unit, grew up in the mountainous area of Guangxi and had never studied before. After he gained the ability to read, he specifically looked for books about the great motherland to read. He said, "I feel even more that our motherland is great and lovable."
    Through cultural learning, the soldiers have become more loving and united. A certain company has soldiers from 21 provinces. In the past, although they were also united politically and in life, there was always some degree of estrangement in terms of emotions and habits because they did not speak the same language. In cultural learning, the communication of language has accelerated, and the emotions have become more harmonious. Soldiers from the Northeast are afraid that soldiers from Guangdong and Guangxi will not pronounce the sounds accurately, and soldiers from Guangdong and Guangxi are worried that the northern soldiers will be affected by the heat and affect their learning. Therefore, everyone is always actively and proactively trying to find ways to help each other.
    After many soldiers gained writing ability, they practiced writing letters to their families to report good news. An old lady from the Northeast traveled thousands of miles to the troops to find her son. Seeing that her son was actively learning culture, she was greatly moved. Before leaving, she said, "Child, learn, learn well! None of our ancestors for three generations has ever studied. Chairman Mao led us to turn over and asked our children to learn culture. What else can I say!" The child also expressed his determination to his mother: "I am still young now, I must study culture well and be a good soldier of the National Defense Army, so that I am worthy of my mother!" The mother left happily, and the child became even more active. When the child estimated that his mother was about to arrive home, he immediately wrote a letter of comfort.
    The achievements of the past six months have been achieved through considerable arduous efforts. Because all comrades have recognized the great significance of learning culture, they have shown a high degree of enthusiasm. If there is no classroom, they build it themselves. If it is not possible to build it, they build a grass shed. Some people cannot even build a grass shed because of other work tasks, so they take classes under the shade of trees. If there is no table, they use the sandbox and their own knees. If there is not enough paper, they use leaves. When starting to learn phonetic symbols, some comrades in the south cannot pronounce them accurately, so they use chopsticks to press their tongues to practice. One comrade put a small stone in his mouth to bite the sound accurately. After more than ten days, the small stone was smoothed, and the sound was also bitten accurately. When the light in a certain unit is not enough, the soldiers roll white cardboard into a trumpet shape to gather moonlight instead of a lamp. If the lessons learned during the day have not been reviewed, they secretly review them in bed at night with a small flashlight. When the Li Shusen study group practiced writing, everyone's hands were so swollen that they could not hold chopsticks. No matter how busy the official duties are, the class must be made up, and the homework must be handed in. The soldiers said, "It doesn't matter if you eat one less meal, it's no problem if you don't sleep for two nights, but you can't miss class." As for the small creations in cultural learning, there are even more. For example, students made phonetic film clips, literacy slides, cultural targets, established cultural hospitals (to heal each other's article problems) and cultural sanatoriums (to distinguish between homophones, synonyms, and homographs), and made their own chalk, bamboo pens, pine oil lamps, moonlight lamps, as well as portable small desks and small benches that can hold books and can be used as seats.
    Because they have displayed a high degree of revolutionary heroism in their studies, a large number of learning models have emerged. In a certain army unit alone, the number of people who have made meritorious service in learning has reached 5,754, including 4,814 students, 518 teachers, and 422 cadres. Many famous combat companies have now become learning model units, such as the "Iron Second Company" from Jinggangshan, the Seventh Company of a certain unit personally cultivated by Comrade Liu Zidan – the "Iron Company," and the "Shenshan Community Company," which almost always made meritorious service in various combat tasks. The famous "Tashan Hero Regiment" was also praised in learning. Many heroes who participated in the National Combat Heroes Congress in 1950, such as Li Guangzheng, Li Wanyu, Ning Zhengui, Liu Xihong, and Qian Anliang, were again selected as learning models. At the Third Cultural Teaching Congress convened by the entire army on "July 1st," they gloriously reunited, exchanged learning experiences, and encouraged each other: "Heroes must always move forward!"
    Another important gain in cultural teaching is that the broad masses of intellectuals and workers and peasants in our troops have become more closely integrated. At the beginning of cultural learning, the leadership called for a "respect teachers and love students" movement throughout the army. All comrades responded to this call, and good results have now been received. The noble qualities and learning spirit of cadres and soldiers from worker and peasant backgrounds have educated intellectuals, and comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds have further seen the role of intellectuals in the troops. Intellectuals have also been well-trained in teaching. Therefore, everyone has become more closely integrated in terms of class viewpoints, thoughts, and feelings. The teachers said, "No matter how great our difficulties are, they are solved as soon as we get to the class." This means that they have understood relying on the masses and contacting the masses. The students said, "We have achieved results in learning, and our teachers have made the greatest efforts!" In life, the soldiers are considerate to the teachers, caring and asking about their well-being, washing their clothes, and fetching water for them, and some even put some sugar or licorice in the water when fetching it. In particular, the respect for teachers in cultural learning has moved the teachers. The teachers are constantly encouraging themselves: "With such good students, what reason do we have not to teach them well?" From the deeds of thousands of meritorious model teachers, we can see that they are also progressing rapidly.

    第四野战军在速成识字基础上的文化进军
    吴明
    第四野战军在基本上消除了文盲以后，又发布了
    “小学语文教学实施方案”，经过严格的编班测验，全部参加学习的干部、战士，都转入了语文课本教学。现在部队中百分之七十到八十的人，进入了初小四年级以上的班级继续学习（千字以下的半文盲仅占百分之二左右）。待他们具备了相当的语文基础之后，即开始学习算术、自然、史地等文化科学知识（有些单位已开始了这方面的教学）。
    著名的练兵模范李国富领导的第八班，原来绝大部分战士是文盲，李国富本人也只认识七百字；现在全班不仅都能阅读一般的书报，而且能写几百字的文章了，他们的语文都已达到高小程度。某部机炮连李树森学习小组的五个人，原来只有一个人认识三百个单字，其他都是一个大字也不识，但经过了半年的文化学习，在语文方面他们都是高小二年级生了。曾立过八大功五小功的著名的战斗英雄李万余，一九五○年他参加全国战斗英雄代表大会时，连自己的名字也写不全，但现在，他已是高小二年级的学员了；他领导的某部三连第二排，原来全排绝大多数是文盲，但在李万余的组织领导下，现在全排多半人都已达到高小程度，李万余亲自包教的八个接受能力最差的人，现在都是初小四年级以上的学员。某团千字以下的文盲原来占百分之八十四点七，但现在已达到初小四年级以上水平的占全体百分之七十八点七（其他成绩稍差的多半因为公差勤务、调遣、病假等情）。
    几个月来，阅读书报，对战士们来说，已经成为他们生活中不可缺少的部分。战士们精确地计算着人民日报、战士报、战士生活等报刊发到他们连队的时间。许多人把他们津贴费的大部分拿来买书。某部通讯连战士自己订了五份报，连炊事班也订了人民日报。某部机枪连推选代表去广州参加第三届文化教学代表大会的时候，全连战士托代表捎书的钱就在六百万元以上。某部青年团员李国川刚突击识会了两千多字，就拿全月的津贴费买了八本书。许多党员都买了“论党”、“论共产党员的修养”等文件。某团团图书馆有二千余册书籍，经常全部借出。某部二连全连人不到图书组借书看的仅两个人。现在，在战士们的住室中的窗台上、桌子上、书包里已摆不下他们的书，许多班排都已动手建造自己的书架子。
    每连的俱乐部，成了一个小型的文化馆。只墙报一项，每天都保持三十篇以上的稿件，多的时候
    （如节日）可到一、二百篇。每次看完一部电影，第二天墙报上就贴满了影片观后感的文章。许多单位的墙报稿件必须做到三好——内容好、语句好、字体好才能选用。
    更使人兴奋的是，随着文化的提高，部队中各项工作都显著地提高了。某团原来有十一个连长不能阅读军事教材；现在，他们上军事课前都能做好教案，讲话有提纲，开会作记录，汇报也常用书面了。某部通讯连副指导员汤桂林原来只认识几百字，一切问题靠脑子记，需要写的东西由别人代笔；现在他能写工作总结了，有头有尾，内容分明。班、排每次开会都由大家轮流作记录。今年五四青年节评模范时，大部分材料是由班排自己整理的。某部炊事班长，每天记伙食日报，按旬向连部写总结。目前为了巩固已得的成绩，许多工作都尽量通过书面来进行。这样他们通过文化学习提高了工作，又在工作中把已学得的成绩巩固和发展起来。
    战士们由于大量地阅读了书报，眼界打开了。他们从书报上看到祖国的伟大建设，或朝鲜前线的胜利消息，那种兴奋的心情，就好像自己打了大胜仗
    一样。某部二连战士黄水香，生长在广西大山区里，过去没念过书，在他获得了阅读能力后，就专门找有关伟大祖国的书来看，他说：“我更感到我们祖国的伟大可爱了。”
    通过文化学习，战士们更加友爱团结起来。某连有二十一个省籍的战士，以往他们虽然在政治上、生活上也很团结，但由于言语不通，在情感和习惯上总还有某种程度上的隔阂；在文化学习中，加速了言语的沟通，情感上也更加融洽起来。从东北来的战士生怕两广的战士念不准音，两广的战士又担心北方战士会因天热而影响学习，因而大家总在积极地主动地想办法互相帮助。
    许多战士有了写作能力以后，就练习写信向家中报喜。东北有一个老太太，跋涉万里到部队来找儿子，一看儿子正在积极地学文化，受到了极大的感动。临走时，她说：“孩子，学吧，好好地学吧！咱祖宗三代没有一个人念过书。毛主席领导我们翻了身，又叫我们的孩子学文化，我还有啥话可说！”孩子也向母亲表示了决心：“我现在还年青，我一定好好地学好文化，当好国防军的战士，这才对得起妈妈！”妈妈高兴地走了，孩子更积极起来。孩子估计妈妈快要到家的时候，马上写了封安慰的信。
    半年来的成绩，是经过了相当艰巨的努力才得来的。由于全体同志认清了学文化的重大意义，他们表现了高度的积极性。没有课堂，就自己动手来建造；没有可能建造时就搭草篷；有的因为其他的工作任务连草篷也不能搭，就在树荫下上课。没有桌子，就利用沙盘和自己的膝盖。纸不够用，就利用树叶。开始念注音符号，南方的同志有的念不准，就用筷子压着自己的舌头来练；有一个同志为了咬准音，在自己嘴里放了块小石头，十几天后，小石头磨滑了，音也咬准了。某部灯光不够，战士们用白纸壳卷成喇叭形，聚月光而代灯。白天学的课没复习完，夜间就在被窝里用小手电偷着复习。李树森学习小组练习写字的时候，大家的手练得肿的不能拿筷子了。公差勤务再忙，课得补，作业得交。战士们说：“饭少吃一顿不要紧，觉两夜不睡没问题，但课不能不上。”至于说到在文化学习中的小创造，那就更多了。像学员们制造了拼音洋片、识字幻灯、文化打靶，建立了文化医院（互相医治文章的毛病）和文化疗养院（分别同音、同义、同形的字），自制了粉笔、竹笔、松油灯、月光灯，以及可以携带的小书桌，可以装书又可以坐人的小板凳等。
    由于他们在学习中发挥了高度的革命英雄主义，大批的学习模范涌现出来了。仅某军一个单位在学习上立功的人数即达五千七百五十四人；其中学员立功者四千八百十四人，教员立功者五百十八人，干部立功者四百二十二人。许多著名的战斗连队，如今又成了学习模范单位，像从井冈山下来的“钢铁第二连”、刘子丹同志亲手培植的某部七连——“钢铁连”，过去差不多各种战斗任务都立功的“神山社连”等；著名的“塔山英雄团”在学习中也受到表扬；许多参加一九五○年全国战斗英雄代表大会的英雄，像李广正、李万余、寗振贵、刘希洪、钱安良等又被选为学习模范，在“七一”全军召开的第三届文化教学代表大会上，他们又光荣地会师了，他们互相交流学习经验，互相勉励着：“英雄要永远前进！”
    在文化教学中另一个重要的收获是，我们部队中广大知识分子和工农分子更进一步地结合起来了。文化学习一开始，领导上就号召在全军中展开“尊师爱生”运动，全体同志都响应了这个号召，现在已收到良好的效果。工农出身的干部、战士的高贵的品质及学习精神教育了知识分子，工农出身的同志进一步看清了知识分子在部队里的作用；知识分子在教学中自己也得到很好的锻炼。因而大家从阶级观点上、思想情感上更加紧密地结合在一起了。教员们说：“我们有天大的困难，一到班里就解决了。”这就是说他们已经懂得了依靠群众和联系群众。学员们说：“我们学习获得成绩，我们的教员是尽了最大的努力的！”在生活上战士们对教员体贴备至，问寒问暖，代洗衣服、打水，有的打水时还在水里放上些糖或甘草。特别是在文化学习上对教员的尊重，更使教员们感动，教员们时刻勉励自己：“有这样好的学员，我们有什么理由不把他们教好呢？”从千百个立功的模范教员的事迹中，我们可以看出他们也是飞快地进步着。
