(Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, August 20th) After the promulgation of the "Implementation Outline for National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" and related laws, people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia Province held discussions or issued statements, expressing their warm support. More than 120 Hui teachers among the primary and secondary school teachers in Ningxia Province who are participating in ideological remolding studies hailed that this outline will bring unlimited prosperity and happiness to all ethnic groups. Ma Jinku, the Imam of the South Great Mosque in Yinchuan, specially gathered Hui propagandists, reading group leaders, and more than 500 Hui men and women near the mosque to publicize the contents of the outline to them. Everyone believed that this was a great happy event for all ethnic minorities in our country.

Hui democratic personages in Ningxia Province, such as Ma Quanliang, also issued statements one after another, expressing their gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. They believe that the ethnic policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government have eliminated centuries of discrimination and estrangement between ethnic groups and developed the political, economic, and cultural construction of all ethnic groups. The promulgation of the outline and related laws will further bring happiness to all ethnic minorities.

Tao Yile, a Mongolian from the Alxa Banner Autonomous Region who came to the Ningxia Cadre School for advanced studies, happily said: Since the implementation of regional autonomy in the Alxa Banner, the Mongolian people have become their own masters, and the "Bags" (administrative villages) have completely changed their appearance. Now, the Mongolian herdsmen can freely graze their cattle and sheep on their beloved grasslands. New yurts can be seen everywhere in the sandy areas. The herdsmen all say: Thank the Communist Party for helping us implement regional autonomy. We have not only increased a large number of livestock, but also our population has prospered.

In order to implement this outline in the areas where ethnic minorities live in Ningxia Province, the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government decided to hold the second enlarged meeting of the commission on August 21 to specifically discuss the steps and methods for promoting national regional autonomy.

    宁夏省各民族人士
    拥护民族区域自治实施纲要
    【新华社银川二十日电】“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”及有关法令公布后，宁夏省各民族人士纷纷举行座谈会或发表谈话，表示热烈的拥护。正在参加思想改造学习的宁夏省中、小学教师中的一百二十多名回民教师，欢呼这一纲要将给各民族带来无限的繁荣和幸福。银川南大寺伊斯兰教教长马金库，特地召集了该寺附近的回族宣传员、读报组长和五百多个回族男女，向他们宣传纲要内容，大家都认为这是我国各少数民族的一件大喜事。
    宁夏省回族民主人士马全良等也纷纷发表谈话，感谢中国共产党和中央人民政府。他们认为：共产党和人民政府的民族政策已经消除了各民族间千百年来的歧视和隔阂，发展了各民族政治、经济、文化建设。纲要和有关法令的公布，将进一步给各少数民族带来幸福。
    前来宁夏干部学校深造的阿拉善旗自治区蒙民陶义乐高兴地说：阿拉善旗自实行区域自治后，蒙民当家作主，各“巴格”（行政村）完全变了面貌，现在蒙族牧民们已可以在自己心爱的草原上自由地放牧牛羊了，在沙窝里到处可看到新添置的蒙古包，牧民们都这样说：感谢共产党帮助我们实行区域自治，我们不但增加了大量牲畜，并且人口也兴旺了。
    宁夏省人民政府民族事务委员会为了在该省境内少数民族聚居区实行这个纲要，决定在八月二十一日举行第二次委员会扩大会议，具体讨论有关推行民族区域自治的步骤和办法。
