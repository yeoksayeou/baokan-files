    Xuzhou-Suqian, Northern Jiangsu Health Work Team
    Forcibly Inoculates the Masses
    Creating Negative Impact
    Editor: In July of this year, the Xuzhou-Suqian County health work team went to the countryside to inoculate the masses with cholera and typhoid vaccines. The health work team did not conduct publicity and mobilization work among the masses beforehand, and did not fully explain the benefits of vaccination. Therefore, many people were unwilling to be vaccinated. Some people said that vaccination was "painful and delayed production," so they hid themselves. When the health work team discovered this kind of thinking among the masses, they did not actively carry out publicity work; instead, in order to complete the "task" as soon as possible, they even adopted coercive inoculation methods. Some team members even climbed over walls in the middle of the night to enter the homes of the masses and forcibly vaccinate people. I suggest that the leading organs of Xuzhou-Suqian County educate the health work team to correct this bad work style. Cheng Shuzhen
    Editor's Note: Inoculating the masses is originally a good thing, but the Xuzhou-Suqian County health work team ruined it. The main reason is that they did not explain the rationale clearly to the masses. The leading organs should make correct decisions for various tasks, and the staff executing the tasks must have a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the people; but this alone is not enough, and they must also pay great attention to working methods. Our working method is the mass line method, which is "consulting with the masses when things happen," so as to turn the opinions of the leadership into the opinions of the masses, and make the masses consciously move forward on the road pointed out by the leading organs. Otherwise, it is possible to end up "contrary to one's wishes," and even arouse opposition from the masses.

    苏北邳睢县卫生工作队
    强迫给群众打针
    造成不良影响
    编辑同志：今年七月间，邳睢县卫生工作队下乡给群众注射霍乱伤寒疫苗。卫生工作队事先没有向群众进行宣传动员工作，没有充分地把注射疫苗的好处说清楚，因此，很多群众不愿意注射疫苗。有些人说，注射疫苗“又痛又耽搁生产”，于是就藏起来了。卫生工作队发现了群众这种思想情况，还不积极进行宣传工作；而为了早日完成“任务”，他们甚至采取了强迫注射的办法。有些队员竟半夜翻墙进入群众的家里，抓人打针。我建议邳睢县领导机关教育卫生工作队改正这种不良作风。    程树榛
    编者按：给群众注射疫苗，本来是一件好事情，但邳睢县卫生工作队把它办坏了。主要的原因是没有把道理给群众说清楚。领导机关应该对于各种工作作出正确的决定，执行任务的工作人员必须有高度的为人民服务的热情；但仅仅这样是不够的，还必须十分讲求工作方法。我们的工作方法就是群众路线的方法，就是“有事和群众商量”，以便把领导方面的意见变成群众的意见，使群众自觉地向领导机关指出的道路前进。否则，就有可能弄得“事与愿违”，甚至引起群众的反对。
