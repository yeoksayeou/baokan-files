    Visiting Yaoshanggou, a Model Village for Substitute Farming
    Wang Shiyuan
    Recently I visited Yaoshanggou Village in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, a model village for substitute farming.
    Wang Jinyun, the secretary of the CCP Yaoshanggou Village Branch, and Liu Haiyan, the Civil Affairs Commissioner of the village government, informed me of the increasing land yields year by year for the families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers in the village: In 1948, the average grain yield per mu of substitute-farmed land was 9 dou, 8 sheng, and 3 he; in 1949, it reached 1 shi, 2 dou, and 3 sheng; in 1950, it increased to 1 shi, 3 dou, and 8 sheng; last year—1951—the Party branch put forward a resounding slogan to all the farmers in the village: "Ensure that the yield of substitute-farmed land exceeds the level of ordinary people." The farmers in the whole village actively responded, and the average yield per mu of substitute-farmed land increased to 1 shi, 8 dou, and 4 sheng, exceeding the average yield of ordinary people by 5 sheng. This year, the substitute farming plans formulated by the village's agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams all propose guaranteeing a further increase of 5 dou and 5 sheng per mu of substitute-farmed land on the basis of last year, reaching a high yield of 2 shi and 3 dou, 9 sheng.
    This is not an ordinary, simple number. This number contains the high patriotic enthusiasm and determination to defend peace of the farmers in Yaoshanggou.
    The farmers of Yaoshanggou are now living a happy and peaceful life and are working hard to build a better future. As a result of organized labor, the crops are growing more vigorously year by year. The "Golden Queen" corn has already passed the height of people's heads, and the millet seedlings have submerged people's thighs. This year's harvest will greatly exceed last year's. New houses and cave dwellings have been built everywhere in the village, and many families have installed bright glass windows in their new houses. Young women and children wear brightly colored floral cloth purchased from the supply and marketing cooperative. The whole village is filled with a thriving scene.
    I admire this peaceful and happy scene. But when talking to the villagers, they always tell you about the tragic days of the past, and then look around at the current situation and say meaningfully: "Water has its source, and trees have their roots. We can't forget the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army." Han Shuanzhu, the leader of the model substitute farming group, started from his life of being a farmhand for half his life, and talked about emancipation and becoming a model. He said: "Who did we rely on to be emancipated? We relied on Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and the People's Liberation Army. I will always remember our army. When substitute farming for the families of soldiers, we always got up at the first crow of the rooster." Yang Chunlei, a farmer in his forties, spoke cheerfully about his white flour and floral quilt. He said: "In the past, we had little land and no houses, and doors without windows. Now we eat well, dress well, and even want to make a floral quilt. All of this is thanks to our millions of people's army."
    After talking with many farmers, I remembered what Secretary Wang Jinyun told me at the beginning: "People have established a life-and-death relationship with our army since the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the land reform, it has become even more closely connected."
    The American imperialist aggression against Korea and our country has made ordinary farmers here understand such a truth: "To build, we still have to rely on the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteers to defend our country." Shi Qingyun, an ordinary member of a mutual aid team, said at a forum: "We can use single-blade plows, sprayers, organize mutual aid, establish production cooperatives, become a model village in the province, and formulate our own three-year construction plan. If the American devils were not being beaten by the Volunteers on the Korean front, these would be impossible!"
    I visited many militiamen in Yaoshanggou Village. These young people are very enthusiastic about strengthening national defense. Since the American imperialist aggression against Korea, they have signed up to join the army three times, but each time they have not achieved their wish. Zhang Jinyuan, 21 years old, said: "If we can't go to the front right now, we should do a good job of substitute farming." He voluntarily carries coal and water for the family of soldier Han Ruzhong, and has not missed a day for several months.
    The Civil Affairs Commissioner of the village told me: "The masses know for whom the substitute farming work is being done, and now the preferential treatment work is really easy to do. As soon as the branch and the village government issue a call, the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams automatically formulate substitute farming plans and sign contracts for contracted output and contracted work. When holding 'Patriotic Day' every month to check and revise the patriotic covenant, the masses earnestly check the substitute farming work. The slogan everyone puts forward is 'Soldiers' families first, then ourselves.' If someone fails to do so, everyone will raise their opinions to him. Everyone strives to be a model of preferential treatment work." Zhang Ezi, a middle-aged woman, said to me:
    "Men who are heroes and models are truly glorious. We are also glorious for doing a good job in substitute farming in the rear. If we can't win a badge, we can still win a certificate of merit; if we can't win a certificate of merit, we can still win praise at the 'Patriotic Day' meeting!"
    In a cornfield in the east of the ditch belonging to the family of a soldier, I saw the members of the Han Wanliang mutual aid team applying manure from their own toilets to the corn of the soldiers' family. The crops had been hoed three times and were more than one person tall. The team members said to me with confidence: "Chairman Mao called on us to work hard to support the front. We wrote in the patriotic covenant a guarantee: We must make the yield of the soldiers' family's land exceed our own. Everyone in the village wants to be a model of substitute farming, and of course we have a share."
    At lunchtime, I went to the home of soldier Han Ruzhang, and the whole family was eating noodles. This sixty-two-year-old ruddy-faced man told me that there were five people in the family, and two school-age children were studying in elementary school. I asked him what difficulties he had in his life. He picked up the noodles in his bowl with chopsticks and said: "We can eat a meal of white flour every day, what other difficulties are there?" In the evening, at the home of soldier Han Ruzhong, the old lady insisted on making pancakes for me. I repeatedly asked her not to bother, but she said: "I am not deliberately entertaining you. Our family has been getting better year by year in the past few years. When comrades come, it's like my children coming back! I don't treat you as outsiders."
    Indeed, the lives of the families of soldiers are improving day by day with the improvement of the lives of the vast masses. I have personally seen that several families of soldiers still have vat after vat of grain stored at home. According to statistics, there are a total of 45 households of martyrs' families, soldiers' families, and disabled soldiers in the village, of which more than 30 households have surplus grain. In addition to repairing houses, digging kilns, and buying cattle, etc., there are now eight families, each with more than ten shi of surplus grain.
    The families of martyrs and soldiers have a high social status in the village. Children going to school are given priority to the children of martyrs and soldiers; the supply and marketing cooperative gives priority to the families of martyrs and soldiers when buying goods; it has become a custom to offer New Year greetings to the families of martyrs and soldiers; whenever there is a village meeting, a "glory platform" is set up for the families of martyrs and soldiers in the venue. Respecting the families of martyrs and soldiers has become a trend.
    The families of martyrs and soldiers who are respected by the whole village are also striving to add glory to glory. In the home of Volunteer Han Jianghe, Han's wife, Xu Lamei, said to me: "Last year, when Jianghe joined the Volunteer Army to go abroad, I met him once. When we met, he showed me a row of badges (commemorative medals, awards) hanging on his chest. I thought: How glorious he is! After I came back, I made up my mind to work hard in production, improve my education, and be enthusiastic about work. I always want to win two badges." Han's mother smiled and commented on the whole family. She said: "In our family, Jianghe is number one, going abroad to Korea to resist America and aid Korea, and protect our country is the most glorious. Lamei is number two, plowing the land, hoeing seedlings, carrying manure, she can do all kinds of farm work and became a labor model in the county; Jianghe's father is number three, his work and production are good, and he was a model civilian worker in the previous years when he participated in the war. Even if I am not the best, but my family is a model soldiers' family, a model harmonious family, and a model healthy family, I also feel glorious." Speaking of this, she took out five glorious commemorative medals brought back by her heroic son from the front and the model civilian worker award flag that Jianghe's father had won a few years ago for me to see. Before leaving, Xu Lamei told me that Han Jianghe had written back to her to compete to see who progressed faster, and the two of them would strive for greater glory and go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao.

    访问模范代耕村窑上沟
    王士元
    最近我访问了山西省的模范代耕村——武乡县窑上沟村。
    中共窑上沟村支部书记王锦云和村政府民政委员刘海炎向我介绍了村里烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人的土地产量逐年上升的情况：一九四八年代耕土地每亩平均产粮九斗八升三合；一九四九年达到一石二斗三升；一九五零年增到一石三斗八升；去年——一九五一年党支部向全村农民提出一个响亮的号召：“要保证代耕土地产量超过一般群众水平。”全村农民积极响应，代耕土地每亩的平均产量提高到了一石八斗四升，超过一般群众的平均产量五升。今年，村里的农业生产合作社和互助组所订的代耕计划，都提出保证要在去年的基础上，每亩代耕土地再增产五斗五升，达到二石三斗九升的高额产量。
    这不是一个平常的、简单的数字。这个数字中间包含着窑上沟农民们的高度的爱国热情和保卫和平的决心。
    窑上沟的农民现在过着幸福的和平生活，并正在努力建设更美好的将来。由于组织起来劳动的结果，庄稼一年比一年长得旺。眼前“金皇后”玉茭已没过人头，谷苗已淹住了人的大腿，今年的丰收将要大大超过去年。村里到处有新修的房子和窑洞，不少人家在新的房窗上装了明亮亮的玻璃。年轻的妇女和孩子们，穿上了从供销社买来的鲜艳的花布。全村充满着一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    我羡慕这种和平幸福的景象。但和村里人谈起来，他们总要给你说一番过去的悲惨日子，然后环顾现在的情况，意味深长地说：“水有源，树有根，我们忘不了共产党、解放军。”模范代耕组长韩拴柱，从他给人做了半辈子长工的生活谈起，一直谈到翻身，谈到当模范。他说：“咱翻身是靠的谁呀？靠的毛主席和共产党、解放军。我永远记着咱们的军队。给军属代耕的时候，我们总是鸡叫头遍就起床。”四十多岁的农民杨春雷，兴高彩烈地说起他的白面和花被子。他说：“从前少地没房，有门没窗，如今吃好穿好，还想盖个花花被子。这都是凭咱有几百万人民军队。”
    我和许多农民谈话以后，记起了支部书记王锦云开初给我说的：“人们从抗日战争时期起，就和咱军队建立下生死关系，土地改革以后，越发成了血肉连心。”
    美帝国主义对朝鲜和我国的侵略，使这里的普通农民都懂得了这样一个道理：“要建设，还得凭解放军、志愿军给咱保江山。”一个普通的互助组员史清云在一个座谈会上说：“我们能够使用单把犁、喷雾器，组织互助，成立生产合作社，当上全省的模范村，订自己的三年建设计划，要没有志愿军在朝鲜前线打击美国鬼子，这些都休想得到！”
    我访问了许多窑上沟村的民兵。这些青年对加强国防非常热心。自从美帝国主义侵略朝鲜以来，他们已经三次报名要求参军，但每次都没达到愿望。二十一岁的张金元说：“眼下不能上前方，就该把代耕工作做好。”他自动给军属韩如忠家义务担煤担水，至今数月，一天都没误过。
    村里的民政委员告诉我：“群众认识了代耕工作是为了谁，现在优抚工作真好做了。支部和村政府
    一号召，该订代耕计划，该订包产、包工合同的，农业生产合作社和互助组就自动订了。每月举行
    ‘爱国日’检查修订爱国公约的时候，群众都认真地检查了代耕工作。大家提的口号是‘先军属后自己’，那家没做到，大伙就向他提出意见。大家都争取做优抚工作模范。”中年妇女张娥子对我说：
    “人家男子汉当英雄模范，真正够上光荣。咱在后方作好代耕工作也很光荣。咱争不上个牌牌子（奖章）吧，还争不上个奖状；争不上奖状吧，还争不上个在‘爱国日’会上表扬！”
    在沟东军属的一块玉茭地里，我看见韩万良互助组的组员们正在用自己的茅粪给军属家的玉茭上追肥。庄稼已经锄过三遍，长得有一人多高。组员们满有信心地对我说：“毛主席号召我们努力支援前方，我们在爱国公约上写下保证：一定叫军属土地产量超过自己。全村人个个都想争个代耕模范，我们当然有份。”
    吃午饭时，我到了军属韩如章家里，全家正在吃面条。这位六十二岁的红光满面的老人告诉我：家里有五口人，两个学龄儿童都在小学念书。我问他生活上有什么困难，他用筷子挑起碗中的面条说：“天天能吃上一顿白面，还有啥困难？”傍晚在军属韩如忠家里，老大娘一定要给我烙饼吃，我再三请她不要费事，她却说：“我这可不是专意招待你，这几年我们家里一年比一年好了，同志们来了，还不和我孩子回来一样！我可不把你当外人看待。”
    的确，军属的生活，随着广大群众的生活的改善，一天一天在改善着。我亲眼看见好几家军属的家里，到现在还存着一缸一缸的粮食。据统计，全村共有烈属、军属、残废军人四十五户，其中有三十多户有余粮，除去修房、打窑、买牛等等，如今还有八家，每家余粮都在十石以上。
    烈属、军属在村里有很高的社会地位。孩子们上学，先尽烈属、军属子弟；供销社买货，先尽烈属、军属家庭；给烈属、军属贺年拜节，已经成了习惯；每逢村中集会，会场里都为烈属、军属设有“光荣台”。尊敬烈属、军属，已经成为风气。
    受到全村尊敬的烈属、军属们，也在争取光荣上加光荣。在志愿军韩江河同志的家里，韩同志的爱人徐腊梅对我说：“去年，江河参加志愿军出国时，我去见了一面。碰到一块，他就让我看他胸前挂着的一排子牌牌（纪念章、奖章）。我就想：人家多光荣哩！我回来以后，下定决心，努力生产，提高文化，热心工作，总要争上两个牌牌。”韩同志的母亲笑眯眯地评论着全家。她说：“在咱家，江河数第一，出国到朝鲜，抗美援朝，保家卫国，最光荣。腊梅数第二，犁地、锄苗、担粪，庄稼活样样能干，当了县里劳动模范；江河爹数第三，工作、生产都好，前几年参战当过模范民工。就算我顶不行，不过我家是模范军属、模范和睦家庭、模范卫生家庭，我也觉得光荣。”说到这里，她从柜里拿出他的英雄儿子从前方捎回来的五个光荣纪念章和江河父亲前几年得的模范民工奖旗给我看。临走，徐腊梅告诉我：韩江河曾写信回来和她比赛看谁进步得快，他们俩要争取更大的光荣，到北京去见毛主席哩。
