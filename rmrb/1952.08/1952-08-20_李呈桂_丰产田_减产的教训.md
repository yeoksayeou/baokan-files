    The Lesson of Li Chenggui's Reduced Yield on "High-Yield Fields"
    Editor: The "New Hunan Daily" published the following news on July 24th: Li Chenggui of Liling, Hunan, a nationally renowned model for high-yield rice, harvested only 529 catties of grain from his one-mu-plus high-yield field this year. I read this news to students at the people's school and members of the mutual aid team, and we discussed and studied the matter. Everyone believes that Li Chenggui is a truly capable farmer, and his high-yield experience has played a significant role throughout the country, especially in Hunan. The reduction in yield on Li Chenggui's high-yield field was mainly due to the lodging of the rice, but Li Chenggui had already introduced methods to prevent "green wind" (lodging) in June. Many farmers learned this method, and it was very effective. Why didn't he use it himself? If the reason for the lodging was that "the plowing was too shallow, the sun was too harsh, and too many people were treading on it," then why didn't Old Li use his own "deep plowing and careful cultivation" experience?
    We know that this cannot be entirely blamed on Li Chenggui; ultimately, it is a problem of leadership. The main reason for the yield reduction is said to be shallow plowing. Why didn't the leadership provide scientific and technical guidance? It is said that Old Li was too busy with meetings and other work and had no time to take care of the "high-yield field." Why didn't the leadership try to help him reduce meeting time and other work so that he could concentrate on high-yield farming? It is said that the people who visited trampled the field too much. Why didn't the leadership properly dissuade them? The rice had been lodged for more than ten days, but why did the leadership still say there was no problem? Zhang Shen, the deputy county head of Liling County who is in charge of local production work, and other cadres only checked Li Chenggui's mutual aid team's plan to challenge farmers across the country once, and later the plan was lost, and they didn't even remember the contents of the plan. This kind of blind complacency and bureaucratic style of not conducting thorough inspections is extremely harmful.
    The reduction in yield on Li Chenggui's "high-yield field" is an extremely profound lesson for us farmers and rural cadres. This incident also shows that our production cannot be separated from leadership, and if cadres do not lead in a thorough and dedicated manner, it will be difficult to improve production. Therefore, I have two suggestions: (1) The leadership should improve its leadership of agricultural production. Every district and township cadre should recognize the importance of leading agricultural production work and overcome paralysis, complacency, and an undedicated work style. (2) We must continue to cultivate the Li Chenggui mutual aid team. Li Chenggui himself has a lot of confidence, and the leadership must continue to vigorously cultivate him and the mutual aid team he leads, strengthen scientific and technical guidance, solve all problems within the team, and help team members with more difficulties increase their yields (this year, the yields of households with difficulties were as low as 300 catties per mu). More importantly, they should try to reduce the time Li Chenggui spends attending meetings and doing other work as much as possible so that he can concentrate on high-yield work and create more valuable experiences with his wisdom and high level of production enthusiasm.

### 李呈桂“丰产田”减产的教训

    李呈桂“丰产田”减产的教训
    编辑同志：七月二十四日新湖南报登了这样一条消息：全国著名的水稻丰产模范——湖南醴陵李呈桂，今年有一亩多丰产田只收了五百二十九斤谷。我把这条消息读给民校学员和互助组组员听，并且和他们讨论研究了这件事。谁也相信，李呈桂是真正的作田能手，他的丰产经验，已在全国特别是湖南起了很大的作用。李呈桂丰产田的减产，主要是因为禾倒了，但李呈桂早在六月间就介绍了防止“青风”（倒伏）的办法，好多农民学习了这个办法，很有效果，为什么他自己不去用呢？要说倒禾的原因是“耕浅了，晒狠了，踩的人太多了”，那么老李那个“深耕细作”的经验，自己为什么又不去用呢？
    我们知道，这完全不能怪李呈桂；归根究底讲起来，是领导方面的问题。减产的主要原因，说是耕浅了，为什么领导方面不给予科学技术的指导呢？说是老李工作忙，开会多，无暇照顾“丰产田”，为什么领导方面不想法帮他减少会议时间和别的工作，让他集中精力搞丰产呢？说是参观的人下田踩得多，为什么领导方面不好好劝阻呢？老李的禾倒下去十多天了，领导方面为什么还说没有问题呢？在当地领导生产工作的醴陵县副县长张伸同志和其他干部，对李呈桂互助组向全国农民挑战的计划书，只检查过一次，后来连计划书也不见了，计划内容都不记得了。这种盲目自满的情绪和不深入检查的官僚主义作风，是极端有害的。
    李呈桂“丰产田”的减产，对我们作田人和农村干部是一个极其深刻的教训。这件事也说明了：我们的生产是离不开领导的，干部不好好深入领导，生产就难搞好。因此，我有两个建议：（一）领导方面要改进对农业生产的领导。每一个区乡干部都应认识农业生产工作领导的重要性，克服麻痹、自满的思想和不深入的工作作风。（二）必须继续培养李呈桂互助组。李呈桂本人信心是很足的，领导方面必须继续大力培养他和他所领导的互助组，加强科学的技术指导，解决组内一切问题，帮助困难多的组员提高产量（今年困难户产量每亩低到三百多斤）；更重要的是尽可能想法减少李呈桂参加开会的时间和别的工作，让他集中精力搞丰产工作，凭着他的智慧和高度的生产积极性，创造更多的宝贵经验。  邓赓梅
