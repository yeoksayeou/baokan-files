    Communist Party Member Wang Jiachang Actively Leads the Masses in the Struggle Against Natural Disasters
    Editor: Wang Jiachang, a Communist Party member from Jianhe Village, Er District, Qixian County, has fully demonstrated the spirit of a Communist Party member who is unafraid of difficulties and is firm and courageous in the struggle against natural disasters, and has won the praise of the local people.
    After Jianhe Village suffered a hailstorm, Wang Jiachang responded to the Party's call and actively led the masses to replant late crops during the day and made radio propaganda at night. He slept very little every day. When the masses lacked seeds, he ran to villages more than ten miles away that had not been affected by the disaster to buy seeds. Under his influence, the village's plan to replant one thousand acres of land was successfully completed. Soon, there was another torrential rain, and the flood control canal near the south of Jianhe Village had a very rapid flow. Wang Jiachang was afraid of causing a flood, so he mobilized more than eighty people to rescue it. When everyone arrived at the canal, the flood control canal had already breached more than two zhang (丈, a Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters) wide, and the flood was about to submerge the crops. Wang Jiachang immediately jumped into the turbulent water to block the breach, disregarding his own safety. Under his leadership, twenty-three activists, including Mang'er and Zhiwa'er, also jumped into the water. They fought the flood for two hours and finally blocked the breach, rescuing more than two hundred acres of land. I think Wang Jiachang's exemplary actions deserve praise.

    共产党员王嘉昌积极领导群众和自然灾害作斗争
    编辑同志：我县二区涧壑村的共产党员王嘉昌，在和自然灾害作斗争中，充分表现了共产党员不怕困难、坚毅勇敢的精神，得到当地群众的称赞。
    涧壑村受了雹灾以后，王嘉昌响应党的号召，白天积极带领群众抢种晚庄稼，黑夜作广播宣传，他每天都睡觉很少。当群众缺少种子时，他跑到十里以外没有受灾的村子去买种子。在他的影响下，全村抢种一千亩土地的计划胜利完成。不久，又下了一场急雨，靠近涧壑村南的防洪大渠水流很急，王嘉昌怕造成水灾，就发动了八十多个群众去抢救。在大家到达水渠的时候，防洪渠已经决口两丈多宽，洪水快要淹没庄稼了。王嘉昌马上奋不顾身地跳到湍急的水流中去堵口。在他的带动下，积极分子忙儿、智娃儿等二十三人也跟着跳下水去。他们和洪水搏斗了两小时，终于堵住了决口，抢救了二百多亩土地。我认为王嘉昌这种模范行动值得表扬。    中共山西省祁县县委    武景信
