    Leng Guiman Creates Automatic Stop Device for Broken Spindles on Twisting Frames
    Editor: Leng Guiman, a maintenance worker at the Northeast Wafangdian Textile Factory, has successfully created an automatic stop device for broken spindles on twisting frames.
    Since the "Quality Remedial Class" at the Northeast Wafangdian Textile Factory, Leng Guiman has further realized the importance of improving product quality. However, the products from the twisting frames often have oil stain defects, resulting in significant waste. More than 90% of these oil stain defects are caused by the spindles continuing to rotate after the yarn breaks, causing the yarn ends to come into contact with the grease on the traveller, thus contaminating the yarn ends with oil and causing them to be wound onto the bobbin. With the help of technician Yang Min, Leng Guiman painstakingly researched and created an automatic stop device for broken spindles on twisting frames. After installing this device on the twisting frames, the spindle stops rotating when the yarn breaks, eliminating the phenomenon of oil stain defects. Calculated on the basis of a 5,000-spindle twisting frame, this can increase production and save the country the equivalent of one hundred tons of grain in wealth annually.

    冷贵满创造捻线机断头锭子自停装置
    编辑同志：东北瓦房店纺织厂保全工冷贵满，创造捻线机上的断头锭子自停装置成功。
    东北瓦房店纺织厂自“质量补课”后，冷贵满进
    一步认识到了提高产品质量的重要。但捻线机上的产品，因常发生油污疪点，浪费很大。而油污疪点的造成，百分之九十以上是因为纱断头后锭子不停的回转，线头和钢领上的黄油接触，线头沾上了油，再缠在木管上而造成。冷贵满在技术员杨民的帮助下，经苦心钻研，创造了捻线机断头锭子自停的装置。捻线机安上这一装置后，当线一断，锭子便不转了，免除了油污疪点的现象。仅以五千锭捻线机计算，全年可为国家增产节约价值一百吨粮食的财富。　东新
