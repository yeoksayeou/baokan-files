Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 17th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continue to fiercely annihilate invading enemy troops. East of the Bukhan River, a group of enemy troops launched an attack on one of our army's outpost positions on the 12th. After inflicting casualties on the enemy, our small number of defending troops proactively and temporarily withdrew from the area. By late night on the 13th, our army suddenly launched a powerful counterattack, quickly recovering this outpost position and continuously repelling more than ten enemy counterattacks, killing and wounding over a hundred enemy soldiers. On the morning of the 15th, the enemy again used forces ranging from one company to one battalion to attack this outpost position multiple times, but all were repelled by our army. Afterwards, the enemy increased their forces, attempting to continue their invasion, and were met with fierce bombardment from our army's artillery. That afternoon, the enemy changed to small-scale forces and continued with five charges, which were again repelled. In the continuous four-day battle, the enemy suffered over five hundred and sixty casualties.

On a position in the northwest of Cheorwon, our defending troops continuously defeated four invasions by two companies of the U.S. invading army's 2nd Division on the 14th, killing and wounding 183 enemy soldiers.

Our army, guarding the Gao County line on the east coast, launched a counterattack on the enemy on a high ground south of Gao County on the 11th, wiping out an entire company of the defending enemy, the Li pseudo-army, killing and wounding more than 250 enemy soldiers.

The heroic Korean and Chinese People's artillery units inflict serious losses on the enemy in manpower and material every day. On the 11th, our artillery destroyed four enemy tanks, shot down two enemy helicopters, two reconnaissance planes, and one artillery spotting plane, and destroyed three enemy howitzers in the southwest of Kimhwa area. On the 12th, the artillery units destroyed two more enemy tanks and four vehicles. In these two days, the enemy killed and wounded by our artillery reached 555.

Our army's powerful coastal defense artillery, on the 13th, again sank enemy minesweeper No. 507 on the sea east of Gao County on the east coast. In the previous few days, our coastal defense artillery had already sunk enemy destroyer No. 635 in this area.
