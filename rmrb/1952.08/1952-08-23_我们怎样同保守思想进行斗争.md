How We Struggle Against Conservative Thought
Li Shouqi, Guo Yumin, Deputy Secretary of the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China, Shijingshan Power Plant

    The Shijingshan Power Plant has been studying the Soviet Union's advanced experience in the power industry and has been using low-value coal for power generation for more than three months. During these three months, in order to promote this advanced experience, we have waged a persistent struggle against conservative thinking and have come to realize that in order to win the struggle against conservative thinking, we must abide by the principle taught to us by Comrade Mao Zedong: "Using different methods to solve different contradictions" – a "principle that Marxists and Leninists must strictly observe." Some comrades here call this "prescribing the right medicine for the illness."

    In the Shijingshan Power Plant, the process of burning low-value coal is also a process of advanced thought fighting against conservative thought. At the beginning of burning low-value coal, people with conservative ideas raised various reasons to oppose it. Later, in the face of every difficulty, some people always put forward conservative opinions, hindering the continued promotion of this advanced experience. If these conservative ideas are not overcome, the work of burning low-value coal cannot move forward. These conservative ideas are extremely complex, and different people have different manifestations on different issues. Here, we will only give a few examples:

    At the beginning of burning low-value coal, the conservative thinking of Wang Wenbin, the deputy director in charge of operations, was quite serious. Wang Wenbin is a Communist Party member, from a veteran worker background, and has worked in this factory for thirty-one years. He has excellent technical skills and a lot of experience, but he is limited by empiricism, and is often hesitant in the face of new things, and dares not boldly abandon the old ways. After the issue of burning low-value coal was raised, he still based his thinking on the lessons learned from the failure of burning low-value coal during the Japanese puppet regime, and first considered a series of difficulties. In addition, most of the technicians in the factory at that time also disagreed with burning low-value coal. They underestimated the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and only weighed this issue based on old materials, quotas, and technical standards, as well as their own conservative estimates. The conclusion was: "To burn low-value coal, equipment must be changed; this furnace is designed for burning good coal," "To burn low-value coal, Soviet experts must be invited," and so on. These opinions of the technicians made Deputy Director Wang Wenbin lose confidence in burning low-value coal, and for a long time he was unable to actively and proactively lead this work.

    Among the workers, although production enthusiasm was high, there was also conservative thinking. For example, after the "Red May" competition began, the leadership organized the trial burning of low-value coal. At that time, the workers had just been educated by the "Three-Anti" movement and were very enthusiastic. When the burning of a certain furnace was basically successful, the workers of other boilers automatically wrote notes asking the leadership to approve their burning of low-value coal as well. If it was not approved once, they would write a second time. However, when faced with specific difficulties, various conservative ideas followed. Such a situation occurred in the pulverized coal furnace: there were eight coal feeding nozzles on the pulverized coal furnace. At the beginning of the trial burning of low-value coal, only a kind of low-value coal with a relatively high calorific value and easy to ignite, which they called intermediate material, was burned in nozzles No. 7 and No. 8. Later, the other six nozzles were also mixed with other low-value coal. These low-value coals were not as easy to ignite as the intermediate material. In addition, burning more in nozzles No. 7 and No. 8 could reduce costs, so the workers of the three shifts only burned in nozzles No. 7 and No. 8. As a result, the combustion in the furnace was unbalanced, the flame position was abnormal, which not only affected the boiler output and increased coal consumption, but also easily formed nodules. Engineer Zhao Rongchen and some workers proposed to adopt a mixed combustion method for all eight nozzles, but this was opposed by most of the workers. Some people said that after mixed combustion, the intermediate material would be burned less, and the plan to reduce costs could not be completed; some people said that this would make the coal mill difficult to grind; some people said that if the fire went out after nozzles No. 7 and No. 8 were mixed, it would be difficult to ignite. After the Party organization made some explanations and persuasive education to them, although the workers abandoned the first two reasons and accepted the method of mixed combustion, they still did not dare to open the large air damper, still fearing that the cold air would blow in and extinguish the fire. Why were everyone so afraid of extinguishing the fire? On the one hand, it was because when there were new changes in the coal situation, the workers could not grasp the new operating rules and had no certainty that the fire would not be extinguished (extinguishing the fire is a very disgraceful thing in the boiler workshop). That is to say, there were still technical difficulties. But on the other hand, it also showed that the workers did not have enough confidence in the advanced experience of burning low-value coal and still had many doubts. In addition to this, there was another situation, which was that the labor attitude of a few workers was not correct. For example, when many workers broke the fear of extinguishing the fire, burned mixed coal, and opened the air damper, there were still some workers who refused to open the air damper. The reason was that after opening the air damper, they needed to concentrate on adjusting the air volume at all times, otherwise the fire would be extinguished, while closing the air damper would be more "worry-free," so they were unwilling to open the air damper. This was even more of a manifestation of backward thinking.

    From the above examples, it can be seen that the content and expression of conservative thinking are complex. In the process of promoting advanced experience, if these ideas are not specifically analyzed, the essential problems are not found, and then these problems are not solved in response to various ideological obstacles, even if conservative thinking is scolded all day long, the result will be useless. For example, for Deputy Director Wang Wenbin, the Party organization analyzed that the ideological root cause of his disagreement with burning low-value coal was mainly the fault of empiricism, so it helped him according to this characteristic. For example: using the fact that the workers and masses continued to boldly create and overcome difficulties to help him analyze and understand the various favorable conditions in the current production; through everyone's research and debate in various meetings, enlighten him to learn the thinking methods of those comrades with advanced ideas who were not bound by past experience, and criticize his own empiricist thinking methods; at the same time, help him solve various difficulties in practical work, such as strengthening the work of the technical research association, establishing a coal consumption problem research group, etc. The Party organization also repeatedly helped Comrade Wang Wenbin to understand the great significance of burning low-value coal and encouraged him to overcome the courage of difficulties. When Comrade Wang Wenbin's conservative thinking was broken, he boldly took charge of leading this work. When encountering major difficulties, he even went to the workshop to operate himself. Due to his active leadership and the efforts of the workers and masses, the quantity and types of low-value coal burned increased day by day.

    For those technicians who ignored the creative power of the workers, the main thing was to encourage and promote them to combine with the workers through technical research associations and other methods, so that they could recognize the great and unparalleled creative power of the working class from practice and correct their dogmatic tendencies. At the same time, through the criticism of their own conservative thinking by leading cadres, organizing various reports criticizing conservative thinking, and using individual talks with technicians, they were inspired to consciously conduct self-criticism. For example, when the workers accepted the suggestion of Soviet experts and tried to strengthen and improve the dust blowing work, so that the steam temperature greatly broke through his planned quota, engineer Zhao Rongchen reviewed and said: "When making the plan, I considered all aspects, but I forgot the creativity and enthusiasm of the workers."

    For the conservative thinking among the workers, different methods were also used to solve it specifically. For example, when solving the problem of workers' fear of extinguishing the fire, the Party organization, on the one hand, carried out ideological education against the concern of fear of extinguishing the fire, and on the other hand, improved it from the equipment and operation aspects. The Party organization first started with the backbone members of Zhang Chundi's class, who were young, dared to work, and had less serious conservative thinking. They were told the harm of burning intermediate material alone in nozzles No. 7 and No. 8, and the necessity of mixed combustion, and the workers were encouraged to carry out bold experiments. The workers were afraid that points would be deducted after the fire was extinguished, and the factory director immediately said that the factory director would be responsible for the fire. Then the Power Industry Management Bureau announced that during the three months of trial burning of low-value coal, extinguishing the fire would not affect the reward and would not be counted as an accident. The administrative side also added oil injection nozzles to solve the problem of ignition after the fire was extinguished. Later, when the workers were still afraid to open the air damper, in addition to ideological criticism, the responsible cadres of the general branch, the branch secretary of the boiler workshop, and the Party members personally went to the workshop to encourage the workers to open the air damper, and Deputy Director Wang Wenbin also personally operated and led the workers to solve the operational difficulties. For those workers who wanted to save trouble and refused to open the air damper, the Party organization criticized the error of their labor attitude and at the same time used various examples of correct labor attitude to enlighten them.

    This series of struggles against conservative thinking is also a good education for the Party organization and leading cadres themselves. To specifically struggle against conservative thinking, we must first overcome our own bureaucratic work style and strive to go deep into the masses and go deep into reality. In the process of burning low-value coal, the responsible cadres of the Party's general branch, the branch secretary of the boiler workshop, and the Party members were always paying attention to the ideological changes of the cadres and the masses and used various methods to go deep into the masses to understand the situation. The Party's general branch and administrative leadership regularly studied the various problems of the boiler workshop that day every night. Without conducting these investigations and research, and only conducting generalized leadership from a high position, it would be impossible to "prescribe the right medicine for the illness." Secondly, the Party organization must have unwavering confidence in promoting advanced experience, otherwise, the struggle against conservative thinking will be weak and it will be more difficult to support the large and small improvements and creations of the masses, so that they will not be suppressed by conservative elements.

    我们怎样同保守思想进行斗争
    中共石景山发电厂总支委员会副书记  李寿祺　郭玉民
    石景山发电厂学习电力工业中的苏联先进经验，采用燃烧低值煤发电办法已经三个多月了。三个多月来，为了推行这项先进经验，我们曾经同保守思想进行了坚持不懈地斗争，并体会到要想取得对保守思想斗争的胜利，就必须遵守毛泽东同志教导我们的：“用不同的方法去解决不同的矛盾”这一“马克思列宁主义者必须严格地遵守的一个原则。”我们这里有些同志把这叫做“对症下药”。
    在石景山发电厂，燃烧低值煤的过程，也是一种先进思想同保守思想进行斗争的过程。在开始燃烧低值煤时，有保守思想的人曾经提出各种各样的理由来加以反对，其后在每一个困难面前，又总有人提出保守的意见，阻碍这项先进经验的继续推广。这些保守思想不被克服，燃烧低值煤的工作就无法前进。这些保守思想是极其复杂的，不同的人在不同的问题上各有不同的表现。这里，我们只举出几个例子：
    在燃烧低值煤之初，负责领导运行工作的副厂长王文斌的保守思想就是相当严重的。王文斌是共产党员，老工人出身，在这个厂已经工作了三十一年。他的技术很好，经验很多，但是受着经验主义的限制，在新事物面前常犹疑不决，不敢大胆抛去旧的一套。这次燃烧低值煤的问题提出来后，他还是根据过去日伪统治时烧低值煤失败的教训，首先考虑到的是一连串的困难。加之当时厂子里大多数的技术人员也是不同意烧低值煤的。他们对工人的积极性和创造性估计不足，只是根据旧的材料、定额和技术标准以及自己的保守估计来权衡这一问题，结论是：“要烧低值煤得改换设备，这炉子是为烧好煤设计的”，“要烧低值煤得请苏联专家来”等等。技术人员的这些意见，更使王文斌副厂长对烧低值煤失去信心，很长时间不能积极主动地来领导这一工作。
    在工人中间，虽然生产热情很高，但也同样有保守思想。例如红五月竞赛开始后，领导方面组织试烧低值煤工作，那时工人们刚刚经过“三反”运动的教育，热情很高。当某号炉燃烧大体成功后，其他锅炉的工人们便自动地写条子要求领导方面批准他们也烧低值煤，一次批不准，再写第二次。但是，当遇到了具体困难时，各种保守思想便随之而来。在煤粉炉就曾发生这样的情况：煤粉炉上有八个给煤的嘴子。开始试烧低值煤时，只在第七号和第八号嘴子中试烧一种含热量较大，容易点火的低值煤，他们把这种煤叫作中间物。后来，另六个嘴子也掺烧了其它低值煤，这些低值煤不如中间物容易点火，加以多烧七、八号嘴子可以降低成本，于是三个班的工友们便都只烧七、八号嘴子，结果，炉膛内燃烧不平衡，火焰位置不正常，不但影响锅炉出力，增加煤耗，并且容易结瘤。工程师赵荣琛和有些工人提出要八个嘴子同时都采取混烧的办法，可是却遭到了大多数工人的反对。有人说，混烧以后，中间物烧得少了，降低成本的计划完成不了；有人说这样烧磨煤机不好磨；有人说，七、八号嘴子混烧后假如灭了火就不好点了。当党的组织向他们进行了某些解释与说服教育后，虽然工人们放弃了前两种理由，接受了采用混烧的办法，可是仍然不敢开大风门，还是怕冷风吹进去后火会熄灭。为什么大家这样怕灭火呢？一方面固然是由于在煤的情况有了新的变化时，工人们摸不着新的操作规律，没有把握可以不灭火（灭火是锅炉车间很不光彩的事），这就是说在技术上还存在困难。但是另一方面它也同样说明工人们对燃烧低值煤的先进经验，还没有足够的信心，还存在着不少的疑虑。除此而外，还有一种情况，这就是少数工人的劳动态度是不正确的。例如当许多工人打破了怕灭火的顾虑，燃烧了混煤、打开了风门后，仍有一部分工人不肯开风门。原因是打开风门后，需要时时刻刻聚精会神地调节风量，否则就会灭火，而关上风门则可以“省心”点，因此他们不愿开风门。这更是落后思想在作祟。
    从以上的例子中可以看出，保守思想的内容及其表现形式是复杂的。在推广先进经验的过程中，假若不对这些思想进行具体的分析，找出本质问题，而后针对各种不同的思想障碍去解决这些问题，纵然是整天把保守思想痛骂得体无完肤，结果也是无济于事的。比如，对于王文斌副厂长，党组织分析了他之所以不同意燃烧低值煤的思想根源主要是经验主义作怪，就根据这个特点对他进行帮助。例如：以职工群众不断大胆创造克服困难的事实，帮助他分析和认识目前生产中的各种有利条件；通过各种会议中大家的研究和争论，启发他学习那些有先进思想的不拘守过去经验的同志们的思想方法，批判自己经验主义的思想方法；同时帮助他解决实际工作中的各种困难，如加强技术研究会的工作，成立煤耗问题研究小组等。党组织还反复地帮助王文斌同志认识燃烧低值煤的重大意义，鼓舞他克服困难的勇气。当王文斌同志的保守思想被打破后，他就大胆负责地来领导这一工作。遇到重大的困难时，他甚至到车间去亲自动手操作。由于他的积极的领导和职工群众的努力，使得燃烧低值煤的数量和种类日益加多。
    对于那些忽视工人的创造力量的技术人员，主要的是通过技术研究会等方式鼓励推动他们去和工人结合，使他们从实践中认识工人阶级的伟大的无比的创造力量，纠正他们的教条主义倾向。同时，通过领导干部对自己的保守思想的批判，组织各种批判保守思想的报告，以及用和技术人员个别谈话的方式，启发他们自觉地进行自我批评。例如工程师赵荣琛，当工人们接受苏联专家的建议，设法加强并改进了吹尘工作，使汽温大大突破了他的计划定额时，他检讨说：“在做计划时，我各方面都考虑到了，就是忘记了工人的创造性和积极性。”
    对于工人中的保守思想，也是采用不同方式具体解决。例如在解决工人怕灭火的问题时，党组织一方面针对怕灭火的顾虑进行思想教育，一方面从设备和操作方面加以改进。党组织首先从年轻敢干保守思想不太严重的张春弟班的骨干分子着手进行教育。告诉他们七、八号嘴子单烧中间物的危害，和混烧的必要性，鼓励工人们大胆进行试验。工人们怕灭火后要扣分，厂长立即表示灭火后由厂长负责。接着电业管理总局又宣布了在试烧低值煤的三个月期间，灭火不影响奖励，不算事故。行政方面又添置了喷油嘴子，解决灭火后的点火问题。后来工人仍不敢打开风门时，党组织除了进行思想批判以外，总支、支部和行政等方面的负责干部又亲自到车间去鼓励工人开风门，王文斌副厂长并且亲自动手操作，领导工人解决操作困难。对于那些想省事而不肯开风门的工人，党组织则批判他们劳动态度的错误，同时用各种正确的劳动态度的事例对他们进行启发教育。
    对保守思想进行的这一系列的斗争，对于党组织和领导干部本身也是一个很好的教育。要具体地同保守思想进行斗争，首先必须克服我们自身的官僚主义作风，努力深入群众深入实际。在燃烧低值煤的过程中，党的总支的负责干部，锅炉车间的支部书记和党员们，大家每时每刻都在注意干部和群众的思想变化，采用各种办法深入群众了解情况。党的总支和行政领导方面每晚定时研究当天锅炉车间的各种问题。不进行这些调查研究，仅只高高在上地进行一般化的领导，就无法做到“对症下药”。其次，党组织对推广先进经验必须具有坚定不移的信心，否则，对保守思想的斗争就将软弱无力，更不容易支持群众中的大大小小的改进创造，使它们不受保守主义者的压制。
