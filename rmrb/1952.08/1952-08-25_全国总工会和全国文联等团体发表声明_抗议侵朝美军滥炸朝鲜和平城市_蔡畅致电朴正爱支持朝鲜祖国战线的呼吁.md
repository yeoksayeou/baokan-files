Xinhua News Agency, August 24th -- The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on the 23rd, protesting the U.S. military's indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities in Korea. The full text is as follows:

The heinous American aggressors, after their conspiracy to obtain at the negotiating table what they could not achieve militarily failed, just as their serious military failures also failed, recently shamelessly clamored to comprehensively destroy 78 peaceful cities in northern Korea from the air, and attempted to use the inhumane method of mass slaughtering unarmed peaceful residents to salvage their defeat. We, the Chinese working class and the broad masses of the people, express our infinite anger at this unprecedented atrocity of the bloodthirsty American imperialists. In addition to further strengthening resistance against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we once again warn the American aggressors that any intimidation and blackmail are absolutely impossible to subdue the Korean and Chinese people. The attempt to realize your conspiracy to detain Chinese and Korean prisoners of war through so-called "military pressure" will never succeed. Any so-called "military pressure" of yours will be completely bankrupt in the face of the heroic struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

We want to tell the American aggressors: The issue of prisoner repatriation must be resolved through negotiation on a fair and reasonable basis. Base conspiracies and atrocities such as "military pressure," indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities, and delaying and sabotaging armistice negotiations will absolutely not solve the problem, and will be condemned by the people of the world. The direct organizers and executors of this unprecedented atrocity—American war criminals—will be sanctioned by the people of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, August 24th -- The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the All-China Association of Literary Workers and other literary and art organizations jointly issued a statement protesting against the U.S. imperialists' indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and villages in Korea. The full text is as follows:

We, representing the literary and art workers of the All-China, express our firm support for the appeal of the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front regarding the protest against the U.S. military's indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and villages in Korea.

The heinous, savage and brutal American aggressors, while destroying international law and frantically conducting bacteriological warfare, abusing prisoners, and sabotaging armistice negotiations, have also planned and frantically bombed peaceful towns and villages in northern Korea, massacring large numbers of peaceful residents. This is something that the people of the world cannot tolerate. This new plan of extermination, formulated by the Truman butchers, clearly exposes the American aggressors' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression.

Obviously, no matter how crazy the American aggressors are, they cannot scare the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world. The strength of our peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is incomparably strong. We solemnly warn the American aggressors here: You must immediately stop this new extermination atrocity, and must abandon unreasonable demands at the Korean armistice negotiation conference in accordance with international practice, so that the Korean issue can be resolved on a fair and reasonable basis. Otherwise, under the powerful blows of the Korean and Chinese troops, and with the concerted efforts of all the people in the world who advocate justice and fight for peace, you will surely suffer an even greater defeat.

Xinhua News Agency, August 24th -- Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, sent a telegram to Madame Park Jung-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, expressing her infinite anger at the American aggressors' indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and villages in northern Korea. The telegram is as follows:

Madame Park Jung-ae, Korean Democratic Women's League, Pyongyang:

After the failure of large-scale use of bacteriological warfare, the inhumane American aggressors openly announced the indiscriminate bombing of 78 peaceful cities in Korea in order to kill innocent residents, women and children.

Chinese women feel infinite anger at the cruel atrocities of U.S. imperialism. We firmly support the Korean Fatherland Front's appeal to the people of the world, and will make a hundredfold effort to fight for the support of our Korean brothers and sisters.

We firmly believe that the flesh-and-blood friendship and firm unity forged by the Chinese and Korean people in battle will shatter all the conspiracies and tricks of the American imperialist bandits. With the deep sympathy and support of the people of the world, our common struggle against American aggression and in defense of peace in Asia and the world will surely achieve final victory.

    抗议侵朝美军滥炸朝鲜和平城市
    蔡畅致电朴正爱支持朝鲜祖国战线的呼吁
    【新华社二十四日讯】中华全国总工会二十三日发表声明，抗议侵朝美军滥炸朝鲜和平城市，全文如下：
    万恶的美国侵略者，企图在谈判桌上取得它在军事上所不能取得的东西的阴谋，终于如同它在军事上遭到的严重失败一样，也同样遭到了失败以后，最近更无耻地扬言要从空中全面破坏朝鲜北部七十八个和平城市，又企图以大规模地屠杀手无寸铁的和平居民的灭绝人性的方法，来挽救其失败了。我们中国工人阶级及广大人民对于嗜杀成性的美帝国主义这种史无前例的暴行，除表示无比的愤怒，进一步加强抗美援朝外，并再次警告美国侵略者，任何恫吓和讹诈是绝不可能屈服朝、中人民的，妄图用所谓“军事压力”来实现你们扣留中、朝战俘的阴谋，是永远也不能得逞的。你们的任何所谓“军事压力”，必将在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇斗争面前，遭到全部的破产。
    我们要告诉美国侵略者：遣俘问题必须在公平合理的基础上协商解决。“军事压力”、滥炸和平城市、拖延和破坏停战谈判等卑鄙阴谋和暴行，绝对不能解决问题，必将受到世界人民的谴责。制造这种史无前例的暴行的直接组织者与执行者——美国战犯，必将受到世界人民的制裁。

    【新华社二十四日讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会暨中华全国文学工作者协会等文学艺术团体联名发表声明，抗议美帝国主义滥施轰炸朝鲜和平城乡，全文如下：
    我们代表中华全国文学艺术工作者，对朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会关于抗议侵朝美军滥炸朝鲜和平城乡的呼吁，表示坚决的支持。
    穷凶极恶、野蛮残暴的美国侵略者，在破坏国际公法疯狂进行细菌战争、虐杀俘虏、破坏停战谈判的同时，竟又有计划的疯狂的滥炸朝鲜北部和平城乡、大量杀害和平居民，这是举世人民决不能容忍的；这个新的灭绝人性的计划，是杜鲁门屠夫们拟定的，这个铁的事实，明显的暴露了美国侵略者扩大侵略战争的阴谋。
    很显然，不论美国侵略者如何疯狂，是吓不倒朝中人民以及世界人民的，我们以苏联为首的和平阵营的力量是强大无比的，我们在这里严正警告美国侵略者：你们必须立即停止这种新的灭绝人性的暴行，必须根据国际惯例，在朝鲜停战谈判会议上放弃无理的主张，使朝鲜问题在公平合理的基础上求得解决。否则，在朝中部队有力的打击下，以及在全世界所有主张正义与为和平而斗争的人民一致努力下，你们将必定遭到更大的惨败。
