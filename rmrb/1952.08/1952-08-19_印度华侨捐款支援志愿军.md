Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: Overseas Chinese in India are enthusiastically donating funds to support the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers fighting on the Korean front. As of July this year, donations from overseas Chinese in India to resist America and aid Korea have reached more than 27,600 Indian rupees, equivalent to over 130 million RMB. Donating to support the Chinese People's Volunteers has become a mass movement among overseas Chinese workers, clerks, students, teachers, and businessmen. Not only have overseas Chinese in major cities like Calcutta and Mumbai actively participated in the movement, but also those scattered in small towns have responded enthusiastically. Through this movement, the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese in India has been further heightened.

Many overseas Chinese wrote letters when donating, expressing their sincere support for the Central People's Government and enthusiastically supporting the great movement of the people of the motherland to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country. Many overseas Chinese wrote letters of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteers. Some overseas Chinese schools, shops, and individuals have also established long-term donation plans.

    许多侨胞在捐款时写信表示衷心拥护中央人民政府，并热烈支持祖国人民伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国运动。许多侨胞写信慰问中国人民志愿军。有些华侨学校、商店和个人还订立了长期的捐献计划。
