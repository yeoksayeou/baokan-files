Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 23rd: On August 21st, the United Nations Disarmament Commission continued to discuss the Soviet proposal, which calls for immediate discussion on the issue of violations of the ban on bacteriological warfare, the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, and the punishment of violators of the ban on bacteriological warfare.

At the meeting, Soviet representative Malik spoke first. In his speech, Malik used many concrete facts to illustrate the deceptive nature of the speech made by the US representative at the Disarmament Commission meeting on August 15th, in which the US representative attempted to defend the US government's refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol. Malik revealed the true reason why the US had refused to ratify this protocol for more than twenty years.

Afraid that the Soviet representative would further reveal the true reason for the US government's refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol and the truth about the US's expanding preparations for bacteriological warfare, US representative Cohen attempted to prevent the Soviet representative from finishing his speech midway through Malik's address.

The US representative, invoking the rules that the US and British bloc had forcibly imposed on the committee—namely, that any discussion of "specific accusations" regarding violations of the ban on bacteriological warfare and the use of bacteriological weapons was prohibited in the committee—moved that the committee chairman prohibit Malik from finishing his speech.

Not only that, but he also disregarded the facts and attempted to convince the committee representatives that when he spoke to the committee on August 15, he was not attacking the Soviet Union, but merely explaining the US government's attitude towards the Geneva Protocol, and that he was citing "appropriate" quotations when explaining this attitude.

Soviet representative Malik immediately denounced this absurd action by the US and revealed the motive behind the US representative's attempt to prevent the Soviet representative from finishing his speech.

Malik said: The Soviet delegation understands very well why US representative Cohen does not like what the Soviet representative said in his speech. It is perfectly natural that he does not like these words. What I am talking about now is not the issue of the US aggressors using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China—which is what he is most afraid of—what I am talking about is the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, and what I am saying is that the Disarmament Commission must pay special attention to this issue. I am now listing concrete facts to prove that the US government refuses to ratify the Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological weapons. In view of these facts, the United Nations Disarmament Commission should immediately pay attention to the issue of banning bacteriological weapons.

I am quoting statements made by US officials in US newspapers. If the US representative does not like to listen, that is his own business, but the United Nations Disarmament Commission has no right to avoid the issue of banning bacteriological weapons—this vile and shameful weapon of mass murder. I request permission to continue my speech and ask the chairman to tell the US representative to be patient and listen to all the ruthless facts that I intend to make clear here. In addition, I am prepared to talk about some of the things that the US representative mentioned in his speech on August 15 regarding bacteriological weapons (which he has talked about again in the committee) and present my responses to his untenable arguments. Given that the US representative has the opportunity to speak without any restrictions, I request that I be given at least this opportunity as well. Under the current circumstances, I do not intend to talk about the issue that the US representative is most afraid of, namely the use of bacteriological weapons by the US armed forces against the people of Korea and China. I reserve the right to talk about this issue later.

With the exception of the Turkish representative, who cowardly spoke in support of the US representative, no representative on the committee agreed with the US representative's attempt to prevent the Soviet representative from finishing his speech. The chairman of the committee, the Dutch representative, said in response to the US representative's action that he could not prevent the Soviet representative from continuing his speech and finishing his remarks, because there was no sufficient reason to do so.

The Soviet representative concluded his speech. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled to be held on August 22nd.

### 联合国裁减军备委员会继续讨论苏联建议  马立克痛斥美国拒绝禁用细菌武器

    联合国裁减军备委员会继续讨论苏联建议
    马立克痛斥美国拒绝禁用细菌武器
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日电：在八月二十一日，联合国裁减军备委员会继续讨论苏联的建议，苏联的建议要求立即讨论关于破坏细菌战禁令、禁止使用细菌武器和惩罚细菌战禁令违反者的问题。
    开会时，苏联代表马立克首先发言。马立克在他的发言中以许多具体的事实说明美国代表在裁减军备委员会八月十五日的会议上的发言的欺骗性，美国代表在发言中曾企图为美国政府拒绝批准日内瓦议定书一事辩解。马立克揭露了美国二十多年来一直拒绝批准这个议定书的真正原因。
    美国代表柯亨害怕苏联代表进一步揭露美国政府拒绝批准日内瓦议定书的真正原因和美国扩大准备细菌战的真相，所以在马立克发言的中间柯亨曾企图阻止苏联代表作完他的发言。
    美国代表援引美国在美英集团支持下给委员会强行安排下的规则——即禁止在委员会中就关于破坏细菌战禁令和使用细菌武器的“具体指责”作任何讨论——而提出动议，要求委员会主席禁止马立克作完他的发言。
    不但如此，他又不顾事实，企图使委员会代表们相信：八月十五日他在委员会发言的时候，并没有攻击苏联，不过仅仅说明美国政府对于日内瓦议定书的态度，而在说明这种态度的时候援引了“适当”的引用语而已。
    苏联代表马立克立即痛斥美国的这种荒谬行动，并且揭露了美国代表阻止苏联代表作完他的发言的企图的动机。
    马立克说：苏联代表团很了解美国代表柯亨为什么不喜欢苏联代表在发言中所说的话。他不喜欢这些话，是完全自然的。我现在所谈的并不是美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的问题——他最怕的就是这个问题——我现在所谈的是禁止细菌武器的问题，我所说的是：裁减军备委员会必须特别注意这个问题。我现在正在列举具体的事实，证明美国政府拒绝批准禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。鉴于这些事实，联合国裁减军备委员会就应该立即注意关于禁止细菌武器的问题。
    我是在引证美国官员在美国报纸上发表的谈话。如果美国代表不爱听，那是他自己的事情，但是联合国裁减军备委员会却没有权利避而不谈禁止细菌武器——这种卑鄙可耻的大规模杀人武器——的问题。我要求容许我继续发言，并请求主席告诉美国代表忍耐一下听完我打算在此地说清楚的全部的、无情的事实。另外，我准备谈谈美国代表于八月十五日关于细菌武器问题的发言中所提到的一些事情（他在委员会上已经再度谈论这些事情），并且提出我对于他的站不住脚的论调的答复。鉴于美国代表有不受任何限制发言的机会，我要求至少也给我以这种机会。在目前的情况下，我不打算谈论美国代表最害怕的问题，就是美国武装部队对朝中两国人民使用细菌武器的问题。我保留以后再谈这个问题的权利。
    除了怯懦地发言表示支持美国代表的土耳其代表以外，委员会中没有一个代表赞成美国代表妄想阻挠苏联代表作完他的发言的企图。委员会主席、荷兰代表在答复美国代表的行动时说道：他不能禁止苏联代表继续发言，说完他的话，因为没有什么充分的理由。
    苏联代表结束了他的发言。委员会的下次会议订于八月二十二日举行。
