Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 25th: 475,000 coal miners belonging to the United Mine Workers of America began a strike on the 23rd, holding a ten-day "Memorial Day" to express their condolences for the companions who have died and been disabled in coal mine accidents over the past decade. During this memorial period, all bituminous and anthracite coal mines employing members of the United Mine Workers of America nationwide will be shut down. At the same time, the United Mine Workers of America is demanding that the employers improve safety conditions in the mines during these ten days.

The frequent occurrence of accidents causing worker deaths and disabilities in American industry is due to the increasingly deteriorating working conditions and the constant intensification of the speed-up system. American monopoly capitalists only care about seeking high profits and completely disregard the safety of workers' lives, so tragedies often occur in the workplace. Since the outbreak of the Korean War and the commencement of large-scale military production, the rate of worker injuries and deaths has increased even more severely. According to statistics from the United Mine Workers of America, from December 23, 1951, to the end of July this year, 334 miners died in work-related accidents, and approximately 20,040 people became disabled. Even US President Truman had to acknowledge in a speech on June 2nd this year that the number of work accidents in the United States today is more serious than in 1948. Work accidents increased by 4 percent in 1950 and another 9 percent in 1951. Truman also said:

“In recent years, thousands of miners have died in work accidents, and thousands of miners have been injured.”

### 美国四十七万煤矿工人罢工

    美国四十七万煤矿工人罢工
    【新华社二十五日讯】华盛顿消息：美国联合煤矿工人工会所属四十七万五千名煤矿工人在二十三日开始罢工，举行十天“追悼日”，对过去十年来因煤矿中发生不幸事件而死亡的和残废的同伴们表示哀念。在这个纪念期间，全国一切雇用联合煤矿工人工会会员的软硬煤煤矿均将停工。同时，联合煤矿工人工会要求资方在这十天内改善矿坑内的安全条件。
    美国工业中所以经常发生造成工人死亡和残废的事故是由于工人们的劳动条件日益恶化和赶快制度不断加强的结果。美国垄断资本家只顾谋取高额的利润，完全忽视工人们的生命安全，因此工作中时常发生惨剧。自从朝鲜战争爆发及大量军事生产开始以来，工人的伤亡率增加得更厉害。据联合煤矿工人工会统计，从一九五一年十二月二十三日到今年七月底，就有三百三十四名矿工因工作中发生事故而死亡，有约两万零四十人变成残废。就连美国总统杜鲁门都不得不在今年六月二日发表的一次演说中承认，美国今日工作事故之多，比一九四八年时还要严重。工作事故在一九五○年增加了百分之四，一九五一年又增加了百分之九。杜鲁门又说：
    “近年来，成千的矿工因工作事故死亡，成千的矿工受伤。”
