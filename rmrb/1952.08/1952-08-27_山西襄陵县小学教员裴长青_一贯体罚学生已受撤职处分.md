To the Editor: Pei Changqing, a teacher at Sitou Village Primary School in the Fourth District of Xiangling County, Shanxi Province, has a terrible ideology and work style and consistently uses savage beating as a means to abuse students. Since May of this year alone, he has beaten and verbally abused students dozens of times. Now, the Education Section of the Xiangling County People's Government has given him the punishment of dismissal.

On May 4th, Pei Changqing led students to Xinmin Village to do propaganda work. When students Liu Jinshuo and Xi Shitai made mistakes while playing the waist drum, he slapped them heavily on the spot, knocking them to the ground. After returning to school, he "interrogated" these two students until late at night. When Zhang Xigeng, a teacher at the school, offered his opinion, Pei Changqing felt that Zhang Xigeng was undermining his authority in front of the students and flew into a rage. When Zhang Mingjun and seven other fourth-grade students tore a hole in a window paper while playing, he made them kneel as punishment. Once, when Deng Yuanhuan, a first-grade student, spoke a little louder, he was brutally beaten, so much so that he wet his pants. When student Deng Jieshi offered a bowl of water to a passerby, Pei Changqing said it was a "violation of school rules" and made Deng Jieshi kneel. When students were walking home after school, if he saw anything displeasing on the road, he would order the students to kneel at the crossroads.

Pei Changqing's actions of physically punishing students were completely conscious. He consistently adopted an antagonistic attitude towards the Party, the Communist Youth League, the People's Government, and trade union organizations. Before this year's "May Day," the head of the County Education Section had reported to the primary school teachers on the issue of strictly prohibiting corporal punishment, but after May, his behavior of physically punishing students became even more severe. In order to beat students, he specially made a hand paddle with the words "Promote Your Progress" written on it, and he often used this hand paddle to intimidate students.

Pei Changqing's extremely egregious practices severely damaged the children's spirits and aroused dissatisfaction among the local masses. The villagers reflected:

"When the children in our village see the teacher, they are as scared as if they have seen a wolf!" Only after Pei Changqing was dismissed did the masses say, "Now that's great!"

To this day, cases of primary school teachers physically punishing students continue to occur, and Pei Changqing's incident is just one example. We suggest that local people's governments conduct in-depth inspections and correct this error.

    山西襄陵县小学教员裴长青
    一贯体罚学生已受撤职处分
    编辑同志：山西襄陵县四区寺头村小学教员裴长青，思想作风恶劣，一贯用野蛮的打骂手段来虐待学生。仅从今年五月起，他就打骂学生数十次。现在襄陵县人民政府教育科已给他以撤职处分。
    五月四日，裴长青领了学生到新民村去作宣传工作。学生刘金锁、席世泰两人打错了腰鼓，他当场就重重地打他们耳光，把他们打得躺在地上。回校后，他又“审讯”这两个学生，一直到深夜。该校教员张西庚向他提出意见，他认为张西庚在学生面前下他面子，就大发脾气。四年级学生张明俊等八人玩耍时把窗纸撕坏了一格，被他罚了跪。有一次，一年级学生邓元环说话声音高了一些，被他毒打一顿，直打到尿了裤子。学生邓结实端了一碗水给一个过路人喝，他说是“违反校规”，罚邓结实跪。他在学生放学回家时，如在路上看到不顺眼的事，就会叫学生跪在十字路口。
    裴长青这种体罚学生的行动，完全是有意识的。他对党、团、人民政府和工会组织一贯采取对立的态度。今年“五一”以前，县教育科长曾向小学教员报告了严禁体罚的问题，但他在五月以后，体罚学生的行为更厉害了。他为了打学生，专门做了一个手板，上面写了“促你进步”四个字，经常拿这个手板来威吓学生。
    裴长青这种极端恶劣的做法，严重地摧残了儿童的精神，并引起当地群众的不满。该村群众反映说：
    “我们村里娃娃见了教员就像见了狼一样，吓得不行！”裴长青被撤职后，群众才说：“这下可好了！”
    到现在为止，各地小学教员体罚学生的情形还是不断发生，裴长青的事件只是一个例子。我们建议各地人民政府深入检查并纠正这种错误。
