    Powerful Actions by the People of Western Europe Against American War Plans
    Following the announcement by Britain and France that they were preparing to delay their arms expansion steps due to severe economic crises, the American arms expansion and war preparation plan in Western Europe has recently suffered another serious blow. This is the heroic struggle of the Belgian people against the extension of conscription, under the call of the Belgian Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor. This struggle has forced the Belgian government to shorten the conscription period from the original two years to twenty-one months. At the same time, several other member states of the so-called European Defense Community have also refused to extend conscription according to the wishes of the United States.
    The struggle of the Belgian people is by no means merely a domestic event; it is a powerful expression of the opposition of the people of Western Europe to American war plans. Belgium is one of the countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the so-called European Defense Community. The Belgian government, which has undertaken the task of arms expansion and war preparation, decided in March of last year to extend the conscription period from one year to two years in order to expand its armed forces according to American orders. This measure by the Belgian government, like its measures to expand military bases and increase military budgets in the country, serves the interests of the United States. This seriously damages the interests of the Belgian people and increasingly turns Belgium into a tool for America's planned war. The Belgian people launched a strong protest movement, resolutely opposing the extension of conscription and resolutely opposing the militarization of Belgium. In July of this year, more than 10,000 Belgian soldiers who had completed one year of service resolutely demanded to be discharged; on August 9, more than one million workers held a nationwide general strike to support the soldiers' demands, bringing this movement to a climax. In Belgium, with a population of eight million, such a large-scale action against arms expansion and war preparation could not but alarm the Belgian government and its American masters. After this, the other member states of the "European Defense Community" refused to extend the conscription period at the Paris conference on August 12, precisely because the governments of these countries feared the opposition of the people. This shows how unpopular the American arms expansion and war preparation policy is in Western Europe.
    It is known that the American plan to invade the world is mainly built on the policy of arming its vassal states. Therefore, in Western Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific region, it is trying to piece together aggressive blocs, attempting to drive the people of various countries to act as cannon fodder for its aggression. But this American policy is running into obstacles everywhere in the world. The aggressive blocs in the Middle East and the Pacific region planned by the United States have repeatedly suffered setbacks and have made no progress so far due to the firm opposition of the people of various countries, the refusal of many important countries to participate, and the sharp contradictions between the United States and Britain. In Western Europe, since the end of World War II, the United States has attempted to bind Western European countries to the American war chariot through aggressive measures such as the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty. In February of this year, the United States also forced the so-called North Atlantic Treaty countries, mainly Western European countries, at the Lisbon Conference to establish fifty divisions of aggressive troops by the end of this year. For this purpose, on May 27 of this year, the United States forced Western European countries to sign the so-called "European Defense Community Treaty" and the "General Treaty" for rearming West Germany. However, this series of war deployments by the United States in Western Europe not only failed to achieve its expected goals, but instead aroused even stronger opposition from the people of Western European countries. In recent months, the vigorous movement of the people of Western European countries against the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Treaty," the tide of protests encountered by Plague General Ridgway everywhere in Western European countries, and the struggle of the Belgian people and subsequently the Italian people against the extension of conscription, have created serious difficulties for the United States in promoting its arms expansion and war preparation plan in Western Europe. In Belgium alone, due to the victory of the Belgian people's struggle, 20,000 soldiers will be discharged in November and December of this year, leaving all three divisions of the Belgian army understaffed. Now, the struggle of the people of Western European countries against American war plans is continuing to develop. The people of Western European countries have become increasingly aware that the arms expansion and war preparation policy of American imperialism is incompatible with the interests of the people themselves.
    The victorious struggle of the Belgian people against the extension of conscription has important significance for thwarting American war plans. This is because the American arms expansion and war preparation actions in Western Europe and its aggressive war in Korea, as well as the conspiracy to expand this aggressive war, are the two main wheels in its plan to promote a world war. However, the United States has suffered a serious setback in its war of aggression against Korea and has been forced to conduct armistice negotiations with the Korean and Chinese side; at the same time, in Western Europe, the American arms expansion and war preparation plan is suffering one blow after another. Therefore, as long as the Chinese and Korean people, the Asian people, the Western European people, and the people of all countries in the world unite and continue to wage a resolute struggle to smash the American arms expansion and war preparation policy, they will surely be able to completely defeat the evil conspiracy of the United States to launch another world war.

### 西欧人民反对美国战争计划的有力行动

    西欧人民反对美国战争计划的有力行动
    在英法两国由于陷入严重的经济危机而被迫宣布准备延缓扩军步骤之后，美国在西欧推行的扩军备战计划最近又遭受到另一个严重的打击。这就是比利时人民为反对延长兵役期限在比利时共产党和总工会的号召之下，所进行的英勇斗争，这个斗争已迫使比利时政府将兵役期限由原定的两年缩短为二十一个月。同时，所谓欧洲防御集团的其他几个成员国家也都拒绝按照美国的意旨延长兵役期限。
    比利时人民的斗争绝不仅仅是一个国内事件；它是西欧人民反对美国战争计划的强有力的表现。比利时是北大西洋公约及所谓欧洲防御集团国家之一；承担了扩军备战任务的比利时政府，为了按照美国的命令扩充其武装部队，于去年三月即决定将兵役期限由一年延长到两年。比利时政府的这一措施正如它在国内扩充军事基地、增加军事预算等措施一样，都是为美国的利益服务的。这严重地损害了比利时人民的利益，并使比利时日益沦为美国计划中的战争的工具。比利时人民展开了强烈的抗议运动，坚决反对延长兵役期限、坚决反对比利时军国主义化。今年七月，一万多服役期满一年的比利时士兵坚决要求退伍；八月九日一百多万工人为支持士兵的要求举行了全国总罢工，而使这一运动进入了高潮。在八百万人口的比利时，发生了这样规模浩大的反对扩军备战的行动，是不能不使比利时政府和它的美国主子感到惊慌的。在这以后，“欧洲防御集团”的其他成员国家在八月十二日的巴黎会议上，都拒绝延长兵役期限，这也正是由于这些国家的政府害怕人民的反对。由此可以看出，美国在西欧推行的扩军备战政策是如何地不得人心。
    人们知道，美国侵略世界的计划主要是建筑在武装它的附庸国家的政策上。因此，它在西欧，在中东，在太平洋区域都在努力拼凑侵略集团，企图驱使各国人民充当它的侵略炮灰。但是美国的这种政策在世界各处都在碰壁。美国策划中的中东及太平洋区域的侵略集团，由于各国人民的坚决反对，许多重要国家的拒绝参加，加上美英之间的尖锐矛盾，而一再遭受挫败，至今毫无进展。在西欧，美国自第二次世界大战结束以来，即通过马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约等等侵略措施，企图将西欧各国捆绑在美国的战车上。今年二月，美国并在里斯本会议上迫使所谓北大西洋公约国家，其中主要是西欧国家在今年年底以前建立五十个师的侵略部队。为了这个目的，美国并在今年五月二十七日迫使西欧国家签订了所谓“欧洲防御集团条约”和重新武装西德的“一般性条约”。但是美国在西欧的这一系列的战争部署，不但不能达到它预期的目的，反而激起了西欧各国人民更为强烈的反对。最近几个月来，西欧各国人民蓬勃展开的反对“一般性条约”和“欧洲防御集团条约”的运动、瘟疫将军李奇微在西欧各国到处遇到的抗议怒潮、比利时人民以及继此而起的意大利人民反对延长兵役期限的斗争，形成了对美国在西欧推行扩军备战计划的严重困难。仅在比利时，由于比利时人民斗争的胜利，今年十一月及十二月即将有两万士兵退役，而使比利时所有的三个师的人员都将缺额。现在，西欧各国人民反对美国战争计划的斗争还在继续发展，西欧各国人民已经一天比一天更清楚地认识到美帝国主义者的扩军备战政策是与人民自身的利益不能两立的。
    比利时人民反对延长兵役期限的胜利斗争，对于挫败美国战争计划，有着重要的意义。因为美国在西欧的扩军备战行动和它在朝鲜所进行的侵略战争以及企图扩大这个侵略战争的阴谋，是它推动世界战争计划中的两个最主要的车轮。然而美国在侵略朝鲜的战争中已遭受到严重的挫败，并被迫来与朝中方面进行停战谈判；同时在西欧，美国的扩军备战计划也正连续遭受着一次又一次的打击。因此，只要中朝人民、亚洲人民、西欧人民与世界各国人民在一起，继续为粉碎美国的扩军备战政策而进行坚决的斗争，就一定能够彻底挫败美国企图发动另一次世界大战的罪恶阴谋。
