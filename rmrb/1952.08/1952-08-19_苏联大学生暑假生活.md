Soviet University Students' Summer Vacation Life
Olga Shuravleva, Fourth-Year Student, Moscow University

Editor's Note: Soviet students are now enjoying their summer vacation. We have specially asked Olga Shuravleva, a student at Moscow University, to write this article to introduce their summer vacation life to our readers.

Dear friends! I am very happy to fulfill your request: to talk about how we spend our summer vacation.

A few days ago, I just returned from a tour of Leningrad. This tour was organized by our school's trade union. A total of one hundred top students and active members from various departments participated in the tour. During this time, we visited Leningrad's theaters, parks, and museums. The Chinese Art Exhibition particularly interested me. This exhibition was held in one of our country's richest museums, the State Leningrad Exhibition Hall.

The Soviet state and the Communist Party have created all the conditions for the study of our young men and women. Because of this, I, the daughter of a lathe operator in a textile factory, entered one of our best institutions of higher learning—the State Moscow University—after graduating from middle school. I am now studying in the Department of Linguistics. This department trains teachers and literary editors for publishing houses and newspaper editorial departments. I specialize in modern Soviet literature and plan to work in a publishing house or newspaper editorial department after graduation.

I am an excellent student. The Communist Youth League members of the Department of Linguistics have shown me great trust and have therefore elected me as a member of the Communist Youth League University Committee. The Communist Youth League Committee receives letters from all corners of the country every day. In these letters, students talk about where they are currently, how they are spending their summer vacation, what new things they have seen, and what interesting meetings and acquaintances they have had. Every student can rest according to his or her own interests and wishes. Our university has its own sanatoriums. One of them is located on the southern coast of the Crimean Peninsula, another in the seaside area of the Gulf of Riga, and there is also a sanatorium in the picturesque Krasnovidovo area near Moscow. I have vacationed there twice. Every student can obtain a vacation permit. They receive great discounts, and many students who need treatment also enjoy free benefits given by the school's trade union. Not long ago, a sports camp was established near the Krasnovidovo sanatorium. Two hundred university athletes are preparing there for the autumn sports competitions. We like sports and spend a lot of extracurricular time on them. Recently, our university's basketball team won third place in the national college competition in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine.

Some students spend their summer vacation like this: They have organized rest, and many students form groups of three or five to visit various republics and states.

Several such groups are currently in the Caucasus, on the Baltic coast, in the Urals, and in the Far East. After they return, they exchange their tour impressions and exchange photos. Such trips help us to better understand nature and the customs of our people.

In the summer, students become regular guests of the great Stalinist communist construction projects. These future geologists, soil scientists, geographers, and historians actively participate in construction work as technicians and assistants. Not long ago, our university newspaper dedicated an entire issue to students participating in scientific research expeditions.

These expeditions are led by famous professors and scholars. The East Siberian expedition of the Institute of Geographical Sciences gave student groups important and interesting tasks to investigate the East Sayan Mountains. The group had to traverse 850 kilometers of sparsely populated areas, map the ridge areas, measure the height of the peaks, conduct animal observations, and write route records.

Students participating in the Caspian coastal lowland expedition conducted large-scale scientific research work. Their work contributes to the formulation of irrigation plans for the Caspian coastal lowlands. They often use the results of scientific research as the basis for their graduation theses and research assignments.

Harvesting has begun in collective farms and Soviet farms. Hundreds of students have gone to help the "Memory of Ilyich" and "Road of Ilyich" collective farms located in the Zaraisky District of the Moscow Region. Students participate in harvesting, help organize rational crop rotation plans, and study how to utilize the region's resources. In the evenings, students become active participants in amateur theater troupes, organizers of interesting lectures, and initiators of various sports activities for young farmers. Those students who return to their hometowns to rest also give lectures and reports. For example, Mikhailov, a student in the Department of Economics, gave a report entitled "The Great Victory of the Chinese People," Pyotr Petrov, a fourth-year student in the Department of History, spoke on "The National Liberation Struggle of the People of the Far East," and Kutsimin, a second-year student in the Department of Physics, spoke on "American Aggression in Korea," etc.

Dear friends! The Communist Party, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin himself have shown fatherly concern for the youth. We must study hard and work hard to repay our motherland and Comrade Stalin for their care for the youth.

    苏联大学生暑假生活
    莫斯科大学四年级学生  奥丽加·淑拉夫列娃
    编者按：苏联学生现在正在愉快地过他们的暑假。我们特请莫斯科大学学生奥丽加·淑拉夫列娃写了这篇文章，介绍她们在暑假期中的生活情形给我国的读者。亲爱的朋友们！我十分愉快地来执行你们的要求：讲一讲我们是如何过暑假的。
    几天以前，我刚从列宁格勒参观回来。这次参观是由我们学校的工会组织的。参加参观的共有一百个优等生和各系的积极分子。在这个时间内，我们到过列宁格勒的剧院、公园和博物馆。中国艺术展览会特别使我感到兴趣，这个展览会是在我国最丰富的博物馆之一，国立列宁格勒陈列馆里举行的。
    苏维埃国家和共产党为我国青年男女的学习创设了一切的条件。由于这样，我，一个纺织工厂的镟工的女儿，在中学毕业以后，就进入了我国最优秀的最高学府之一——国立莫斯科大学。我现在在语言学系学习。这个系是培养教师、出版社和报刊编辑部的文学编辑的。我专门研究现代苏联文学，大学毕业以后，想到出版社或报纸编辑部去工作。
    我是学习的优等生。语言学系的共青团员们对我表示很大的信任，因此选我为共青团大学委员会的委员。共青团委员会每天收到全国各个角落的来信，在这些信里，同学们讲他们目前在什么地方，如何过他们的暑假，看到了些什么新的事物，以及有些什么有趣的会见与认识。每一个学生都可以按照他自己的兴趣和愿望去休息。我们的大学有自己的休养所。其中有一所疗养院位于克里米亚半岛南岸，另外一所在里加湾的海滨区，在莫斯科附近风光绮丽的克拉斯诺维多夫地方，也有一座休养所，我在那里休养过两次。每一个学生都可以获得休养的许可证。他们得到很大的减价优待，而许多需要治疗的学生还享有学校的工会所给予的免费优待。不久以前，在克拉斯诺维多夫的休养所附近成立了运动营。二百个大学运动员们正在那里准备秋季运动竞赛。我们喜欢运动，并为它付出了许多课外活动的时间。最近，我们大学的篮球队在乌克兰首都基辅的比赛中获得了全国高等学校的第三名。
    有一些同学这样过着他们的暑假：他们有组织地休息，许多学生三五成群地组成小组，到各共和国和各州去游览旅行。
    有若干个这样的小组现在正在高加索，在波罗的海沿岸，在乌拉尔和远东。他们回来以后，就交换自己的参观印象和交换照片。这样的旅行帮助我们更好地认识大自然和我国人民的习俗。
    在夏天，学生们成为伟大斯大林共产主义建设工程的经常的客人，这些未来的地质学家、土壤学家、地理学家、历史学家们以技士和帮工的资格，积极地参加了建设工作。不久以前，我们大学的报纸把整个篇幅献给了参加科学研究勘察队的同学们。
    这些勘察队是由著名的教授和学者所领导的。地理科学研究学院的东西伯利亚勘察队给学生小组以重大的和有兴趣的任务，去调查东萨扬斯基山区。小组要通过八百五十公里的人口稀少的地区，绘制山脊地区的地图，测量山峰的高度，进行动物观察，并写成路线的记录。
    参加里海滨海低地勘察队的学生们，进行了大规模的科学研究工作。他们的工作有助于里海沿海低地灌溉计划的制订。他们常常把科学研究的结果作为毕业论文和研究作业的基础。
    在集体农庄与苏维埃农庄中已开始收获。数百个同学已到位于莫斯科州查拉依斯基区的“伊里奇的纪念”和“伊里奇的道路”两个集体农庄去帮忙了。学生们参加了收割工作，帮助组织合理的轮种计划，并研究如何利用地区的富源。到了晚上，学生们就成了业余剧团的积极参加者，有兴趣的演讲会的组织者，以及青年农民各种体育活动的发起者。那些回到故乡去休息的同学们也作讲演和报告。如经济系的学生米哈依洛夫作了题为“中国人民的伟大胜利”的报告，历史系四年级学生彼得洛夫讲“远东人民的民族解放斗争”，物理系二年级学生库齐明讲“美国在朝鲜的侵略”等。
    亲爱的朋友们！共产党、苏维埃政府和斯大林同志本人对青年们表现了慈父般的关怀。我们一定要好好学习、努力劳动来报答我们祖国与斯大林同志对青年们的关怀。
