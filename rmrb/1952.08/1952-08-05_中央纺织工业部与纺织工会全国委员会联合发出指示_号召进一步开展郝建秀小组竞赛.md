The Central Textile Industry Department of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union jointly issued a directive on July 25th to further promote the Hao Jianxiu Group Competition. The directive first pointed out that after the Hao Jianxiu Group issued a challenge to the nation's fine yarn workers on May 14th, it was met with enthusiastic responses from the broad masses of workers and staff in various departments of the textile industry. As of the end of June, 455 workshops and groups from 70 factories in Qingdao, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Jinan, Tangshan and other cities, as well as Northeast, Northwest, Southern Jiangsu, and Shanxi, had responded to the Hao Jianxiu Group’s challenge. Facts have proven that the Hao Jianxiu Group Competition has powerfully promoted the ongoing campaign to increase production and practice economy. Currently, many regions and factories have seen a comprehensive competition upsurge, and new production records and advanced experiences are constantly emerging. However, the development of this competition is uneven. Some regions have only mobilized a few advanced groups to respond to the challenge and have not yet formed a mass movement; some regions have launched the competition, but due to a lack of specific leadership, they have fallen into a state of laissez-faire.

The directive pointed out that the key to further developing the Hao Jianxiu Group Competition lies in strengthening leadership. The directive requires textile administrative departments and trade union organizations at all levels to cooperate closely and, under the leadership of the Party, regard the Hao Jianxiu Group Competition as the central link in the current patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy. Boldly and vigorously mobilize the masses, widely publicize the significance of the Hao Jianxiu Group Competition to the workers and staff, and mobilize them to study the challenge conditions of the Hao Jianxiu Group. Based on the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy, and starting from the existing level of their own units, formulate realistic and feasible conditions that are a step higher than the original foundation to respond to the challenge. Through the Hao Jianxiu Group Competition, comprehensively launch a patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy. According to the current specific situation and requirements of the textile industry, the guiding principle of the competition should focus on saving raw materials, improving product quality, and reducing costs, and achieving increased production through saving raw materials. This guiding principle must be implemented to avoid the phenomenon of blind competition. The content of the competition should focus on further promoting and consolidating the Hao Jianxiu work method and the 1951 weaving work method, as well as other advanced production experiences. This is an important method to make the competition regular and ensure the completion of the task of increasing production and practicing economy. All regions should step up the work of summarizing and preserving the work method in preparation for the Preservation Work Method Conference to be held in the fourth quarter. In the competition, vigorously carry out production reforms and prepare for economic accounting. In order to continuously deepen and improve the movement, after the competition is launched, the responding groups should be regularly inspected and evaluated, and experiences should be summarized in a timely manner. Units and individuals who have made inventions, creations, rationalization proposals, and have achieved success in the competition should be given material and spiritual rewards. Attention should also be paid to improving working conditions and doing a good job in summer labor protection to encourage and maintain the enthusiasm of the workers and staff in the competition, so that the movement can develop sustainably and solidly, and strive to over fulfill the national production plan and the task of increasing production and practicing economy by 37,844 billion yuan!

    中央纺织工业部与纺织工会全国委员会联合发出指示
    号召进一步开展郝建秀小组竞赛
    中央人民政府纺织工业部与纺织工会全国委员会于七月二十五日联合发出进一步开展郝建秀小组竞赛的指示。指示首先指出：五月十四日郝建秀小组向全国细纱工人发出挑战后，得到了纺织工业各个部门广大工人职员的热烈响应。至六月底，向郝建秀小组应战的已有青岛、上海、天津、武汉、重庆、济南、唐山等市以及东北、西北、苏南、山西等地七十个工厂的四百五十五个车间和小组。事实证明：郝建秀小组竞赛，已有力地推动了正在开展的增产节约运动。目前已有不少地区和不少工厂出现了全面竞赛热潮，新的生产纪录和先进经验正在不断涌现。但是这一竞赛的发展还不平衡，有些地区只发动了几个先进小组应战，还未形成群众性的运动；有些地区的竞赛虽已开展起来，但因缺乏具体领导，陷于自流状态。
    指示指出进一步开展郝建秀小组竞赛的关键在于加强领导。指示要求各级纺织行政部门和工会组织必须密切配合，在党的领导下，把郝建秀小组竞赛作为目前开展爱国增产节约运动的中心环节。放手地大力发动群众，向职工群众广泛宣传郝建秀小组竞赛的意义，发动他们研究郝建秀小组挑战条件，根据增产节约的要求，从自己单位现有水平出发，制订出较原有基础提高一步的、切实可行的条件来应战。通过郝建秀小组竞赛全面开展爱国增产节约竞赛运动。根据目前纺织工业的具体情况和要求，竞赛的方针应以节约原料、材料、提高产品质量、降低成本为主，从节约原料中达到增产。这一方针必须贯彻，以避免盲目竞赛的现象。竞赛内容应以进一步推广和巩固郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法以及其他先进生产经验为主，这是使竞赛走向经常化和保证完成增产节约任务的重要方法。各地应加紧进行总结保全工作法，准备迎接在第四季召开的保全工作法会议。竞赛中应大力进行生产改革，做好经济核算的准备工作。为使运动不断深入提高，竞赛开展起来后，对应战小组应进行定期检查评判，及时总结经验。对发明、创造、合理化建议以及竞赛有成绩的单位和个人，应给以物质和精神的奖励。并注意改进劳动条件和做好夏季劳动保护工作，以鼓舞与保持职工群众的竞赛热情，使运动持久和巩固地发展下去，为超额完成国家生产计划和增产节约三万七千八百四十四亿元的任务而奋斗！    （新华社）
