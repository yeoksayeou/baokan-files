Reader's Letter

    To the Editor: On July 13th, we convened a forum of newspaper readers from over a dozen organizations to hear their opinions on the issue of reading and studying newspapers among cadres in the organizations. The forum revealed that reading and studying newspapers in various organizations is happening in an unstructured way. Some leading cadres not only fail to actively organize cadres to read newspapers but also intentionally or unintentionally hinder the development of reading and studying newspapers. The chairman of the trade union of the state-owned Tongfeng Flour Mill actually believes that "if workers read newspapers, they won't be able to concentrate on their work, which might damage the machines and affect production." Therefore, he plans to reduce the number of newspapers subscribed to for the workers. Some leading cadres in other organizations also believe that "we are so busy with work, where do we have time to read newspapers? Organizing reading will affect our work." Cadres do not get leadership support for reading newspapers, and as a result, many difficulties arise. Many cadres in the organizations feel that there are not enough newspapers to read. The Municipal Women's Federation, with more than twenty cadres, subscribes to only one newspaper. This newspaper is kept in the director's room, and when the director is not home, the door is locked, so everyone often cannot see the newspaper. The Machine Factory, with 472 people, subscribes to four newspapers. Only the manager, the secretarial section, and the trade union can see the newspapers; other sections and workshops cannot. Comrades from the factory's Party committee also often cannot see the newspapers. There are more than 2,600 stevedores in Xinxiang City, but only 25 newspapers are subscribed to for them; and more than 4,000 construction workers have only about 20 newspapers. Workers have a very urgent need to study current affairs, but no one cares about this issue. Workers reflect, "We want to study, but there is no place; we want to read newspapers, but we can't find them." Since the "Three-Anti" Movement, some organizations have emphasized that office expenses are low, so they do not have the resources to subscribe to newspapers and even want to reduce the number of newspapers subscribed to. This situation must be changed quickly. We have already notified the leading cadres of all departments to recognize the importance of studying newspapers ideologically, correct all kinds of erroneous views, and formulate specific measures to strengthen the reading and studying of newspapers.

    中共新乡市委宣传部纠正某些人对读报的错误看法
    编辑同志：七月十三日，我们召开了十几个机关的报纸读者座谈会，听取他们对于机关干部读报学习问题的意见。从座谈会上反映的情况看来，各机关的读报学习都是自流的。有些领导干部，不但不积极组织干部读报，反而有意无意地阻碍着读报学习的开展。公营同丰面粉厂工会主席竟认为“工人读报，干起活来精神不集中，可能把机器弄坏了，会影响生产。”因此，他准备减少给工人订的报纸的份数。有些机关的领导干部也认为“工作这么忙，那有时间读报？搞读报就会影响工作。”干部读报得不到领导方面的支持，于是发生了许多困难。许多机关干部都觉得缺少报纸看。市妇联有二十多个干部，只订了一份报纸。这份报放在主任屋里，主任不在家，就把门锁上了，大家经常看不到报纸。机器厂有四百七十二人，订了四份报纸，除了经理、秘书科和工会能看到报纸以外，其他科、车间都看不到报纸。该厂党委会的同志也经常看不到报纸。新乡市共有两千六百多个搬运工人，只有二十五份报，有四千多个建筑工人，也只有二十多份报纸。工人对于时事学习的要求非常迫切，可是没有人关心这个问题。工人反映说：“想学习没地方，想看报找不到。”“三反”运动以后，有些机关强调办公费少，没有力量订报纸，还想减少报纸的份数。这种情况是必须迅速改变的。我们已通知各部门的领导干部，要从思想上认识学习报纸的重要性，纠正各种错误看法，订出加强读报学习的具体办法。    中共新乡市委宣传部
