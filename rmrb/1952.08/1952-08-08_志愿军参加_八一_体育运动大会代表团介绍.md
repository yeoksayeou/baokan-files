Introduction to the Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers Participating in the "August 1st" Sports Meet

    The delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) returning to China, invited to participate in the Chinese People's Liberation Army's "August 1st" Army Day 25th Anniversary Sports Meet, consists of 649 cultural, sports, and art representatives and other staff members selected from various branches and units of the CPV. It includes CPV Air Force combat heroes Zhang Jihui, Zhao Baotong, Liu Yuti, and over eighty other combat heroes and people's meritorious workers.
    The delegation consists of three sub-delegations. The first sub-delegation is the visiting group, comprising 119 representatives and staff. They are cadres from the military, political, and logistics departments of various units of the CPV. The Chinese People's Volunteers inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of their predecessor, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and have achieved great results not only in combat style but also in carrying out sports and cultural activities within the troops. The main task of the visiting group is to visit the "August 1st" Sports Meet, observe and learn from the experiences of various units of the People's Liberation Army in carrying out cultural and sports activities, and bring the spirit of this conference back to the Korean front. This will help to launch more in-depth and widespread mass cultural and sports activities in the entire CPV army, to better serve the great struggle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.
    The second sub-delegation is the sports delegation, consisting of 137 athletes and staff, including 23 female comrades. They are outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland with high cultural cultivation, political awareness, and considerable physical training. The heroic CPV commanders and fighters, in order to complete the sacred task entrusted to them by the people of the motherland—resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and protecting their homes and defending the country— persisted in physical training even in the difficult environment of the Korean War. Like in combat, CPV commanders and fighters used the terrain and objects of Korea to conduct various sports activities on hillsides, in gullies, or in forest clearings. After receiving the invitation to visit the "August 1st" Sports Meet, the CPV commanders and fighters intensified their sports training. Except for units performing combat duty, all companies held small selection competitions. Qu Guimin, a propagandist who performed a great service and two minor services, is a scuba diving athlete. Wang Xixian, a special-class meritorious worker who moved two enemy time bombs and rescued five locomotives, is a 5,000-meter race athlete. After a short month of practice and training, the CPV sports delegation became more refined. They are participating in the sports meet's competitions including men's basketball, football, men's volleyball, women's volleyball, obstacle course, dressed race, motorcycle, and also track and field, swimming, horizontal bar, parallel bars, weightlifting, cycling, tug-of-war, etc. On their way back to the motherland's capital from the Korean front, the sports delegation held friendly matches with basketball and volleyball teams in Shenyang, Tangshan, and Tianjin. Because they humbly observed and learned in the competition, they made great progress in technology. The women's volleyball team had the upper hand in the friendly matches along the way. As Li Sai, the leader of the sports delegation, said: "Our team has grown in battle."
    The third sub-delegation is the art troupe, consisting of 393 people, including a 115-soldier dance team. In early July, the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers convened an army-wide art performance review conference, reviewed the achievements of the army's art work, exchanged experiences in art work, and selected excellent programs to return home to participate in the "August 1st" Sports Meet art competition performance. These programs reflect various aspects of the CPV's combat and life in various art forms such as dance, drum, Sichuan storytelling, and chorus. The programs performed by the dance team are all extracted from the rich combat life. For example, the Engineer Dance was created by the soldiers of the CPV engineer unit to commemorate their completion of the "August 1st" Road in one month. The movements in the dance, such as opening mountains, sawing trees, and building bridges, fully express the soldiers' real life. The CPV dance is no longer just a simple "dancing" of "actions." From the Tunnel Dance, people can see how the CPV troops have exerted a high degree of creativity, prevented and attacked enemies with "superior" equipment since the Fifth Battle. Even people who have never been to Korea can feel as if they have personally been to the tunnel from these vivid images. In order to show the CPV's growing strength, the artillerymen also use dance to express the power of their group artillery. Other dances, such as the Telephone Soldier Dance, the Soldier Dance, and the Vegetable Planting Dance, all have their own characteristics.
    Among the songs and performances of the CPV Art Troupe, the reconnaissance hero Han Qifa, self-composed and sung by soldier Liu Peng, the crosstalk "Home on the Position" created by Wang Jianfeng, and the "Cook's Four Seasons Tune" self-composed and sung by cook Zhang Fusheng are all programs that vividly reflect the optimism and heroism of the CPV. This kind of mass cultural activity has truly become a powerful assistant to political work in the Korean battlefield. On the position, the enemy used propaganda planes, propaganda tanks..., to carry out shameless propaganda to us, and the soldiers universally launched cultural activities, and launched fierce battles with the enemy on the ideological front. Once the enemy used loudspeakers to broadcast "Si Lang Visits His Mother", and the cultural and entertainment soldiers in the class led everyone to sing the national anthem. In one position, many comrades were injured, and the entertainment soldiers took the lead in speaking allegro while bandaging the wounds. Mass performances were carried out in the troops, and sometimes the troops would comfort each other. This not only greatly strengthened the unity between the brother troops, but also promoted the revolutionary heroic competition.
    The mass cultural work in the Korean battlefield is so universally and deeply integrated with combat life and tasks. It can be fully seen from the CPV art programs that the vast number of CPV soldiers have extremely rich artistic talents and wisdom. (Xinhua News Agency)

    志愿军参加“八一”体育运动大会代表团介绍
    应邀参加中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会的中国人民志愿军归国代表团，是由志愿军各个兵种和各个单位中选拔出来的文化、体育、文艺代表及其他工作人员共六百四十九人所组成，其中包括志愿军空军战斗英雄张积慧、赵宝桐、刘玉堤和八十多个战斗英雄、人民功臣。
    代表团一共包括三个分团。第一分团是参观团，参观团代表及工作人员共一百十九人。他们都是人民志愿军各部队军事、政治和后勤等部门的干部。中国人民志愿军继承和发扬了中国人民解放军的前身——中国工农红军的光荣传统，不仅在战斗作风上，而且在开展部队的体育和文化活动方面也有很大成绩。参观团的主要任务是参观这次“八一”体育运动大会，观摩、学习人民解放军各部队各单位开展文化体育活动的经验，并把这次大会的精神带回朝鲜前线去，在志愿军全军中更深入更广泛地展开群众性的文化体育活动，更好地为抗美援朝的伟大斗争服务。
    第二分团是体育代表团，由一百三十七个运动选手和工作人员组成，其中有二十三个女同志。他们都是具有高度文化教养、政治觉悟和有相当体育锻炼的祖国人民的优秀儿女。英勇的人民志愿军指挥员战斗员们，为了完成祖国人民交给他们的抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣任务，即使在朝鲜战争的困难环境下，还是坚持着体育锻炼。像作战一样，志愿军指挥员战斗员们利用朝鲜的地形地物，在山坡上、山沟里或林间空地中进行各种体育活动。当接到邀请参观“八一”体育运动大会的通知以后，志愿军的指战员们便更加紧了体育运动的锻炼。除了正在执行战勤任务的部队以外，各连队都举行了小型的选拔竞赛活动。努力开展阵地文化娱乐活动，立过一大功、两小功的宣传员屈贵民，是一个潜泳的选手。搬走敌人两枚定时炸弹，救出五台机车的特等功臣王希贤，是五千公尺赛跑的选手。经过短短一个月的练习和锻炼，志愿军的体育代表团的队伍更加精练了。他们已经参加体育运动大会的比赛项目有男子篮球、足球、男子排球、女子排球，超越障碍、着装赛跑、摩托等；另外有田径、游泳、单杠、双杠、举重、自行车、拔河等。体育代表团由朝鲜前线回到祖国首都的途中，曾和沈阳、唐山、天津各地的篮排球队，举行友谊比赛。由于他们在比赛中虚心观摩、学习，在技术上获得了很大的进步。女子排球队在沿途的友谊比赛中，都占着优势。正如体育代表团领队黎塞同志所说：“我们的球队是在战斗里成长的。”
    第三分团是由三百九十三人组成的文艺队，其中有一百一十五个战士的舞蹈队。七月上旬，中国人民志愿军政治部召开了全军文艺演出检阅大会，检阅了全军文艺工作的成绩，交流了文艺工作经验，并评选出精彩节目，归国参加“八一”体育运动大会文艺竞赛会演。这些节目以舞蹈、大鼓、四川评书、合唱等各种艺术形式，反映出中国人民志愿军战斗与生活的各种方面。舞蹈队所表演的节目，都是从丰富的战斗生活里提炼出来的，如工兵舞就是志愿军工兵部队的战士们，为了纪念他们一个月内完成了“八一”路的修筑而创造的，舞蹈里的动作如开山、锯树、修桥等都充分地表现了战士们的现实生活。志愿军的舞蹈，已经不仅只是简单地把“动作”“舞蹈化”了，像坑道舞，人们可以看出五次战役以来，志愿军部队是怎样发挥着高度的创造性，阻止和打击了“优势”装备的敌人，连没有到过朝鲜的人，从这些鲜明的形象里，都能感到像是自己亲身到坑道里去过一样。为了表现志愿军的愈战愈强，炮兵们也通过舞蹈来表现自己群炮的威力，其他如电话兵舞、战士舞、种菜舞等，都是各有其特点。
    志愿军文艺工作团的歌咏、演唱节目里像战士刘鹏自编自唱的侦察英雄韩起发，王剑峰创造的对口相声“阵地之家”及炊事员张福生自编自唱的“炊事员四季调”等都是些生动地反映了志愿军的乐观主义与英雄气概的节目。这种群众性的文艺活动，在朝鲜战地已真正成为政治工作的有力助手了。在阵地上，敌人用宣传飞机，宣传坦克……，向我们进行无耻宣传，战士们就普遍地展开文艺活动，在思想战线上，跟敌人展开了激烈的战斗。有次敌人用喇叭筒向我们播送“四郎探母”，班里的文化娱乐战士就领着大家唱国歌。有个阵地，好些同志负了伤，文娱战士一面包扎着伤口，一面就带头说起快板来。部队里都开展了群众性的演出，部队之间有时就互相慰问，这不但大大地加强了兄弟部队之间的团结，而且还推动了革命的英雄主义竞赛。
    朝鲜战地的群众性文艺工作就是这样普遍与深入地结合着战斗生活与任务。从志愿军文艺节目中可以充分看出：中国人民志愿军广大战士有着极其丰富的文艺才能和智慧。（新华社）
