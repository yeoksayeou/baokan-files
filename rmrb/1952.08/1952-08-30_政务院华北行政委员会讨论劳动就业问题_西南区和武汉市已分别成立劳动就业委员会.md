Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: The North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council held a meeting in mid-August to study the current labor employment issues in the North China region. After Vice Chairman Zhang Su conveyed the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on labor employment issues, representatives from various provinces and cities attending the meeting introduced the situation and experiences of labor employment work in their respective areas. The meeting conducted detailed discussions on issues such as the registration methods for the unemployed and underemployed, vocational training, relief measures, placement work, and how to prevent the creation of new unemployment. In his concluding remarks, Vice Chairman Zhang Su pointed out that the current unemployment problem is a temporary difficulty encountered in the course of progress, and the large-scale development of national economic construction provides favorable conditions for solving the unemployment problem. He believes that to do a good job in labor employment, it is first necessary to have a correct view of this issue, to recognize both the favorable conditions and the difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose impatient emotions and passive waiting attitudes, and to adopt a comprehensive, long-term, and active approach to solve the problem of labor employment. Finally, he requested all regions to formulate work plans and quickly establish labor employment committees.

In the past three years, the labor employment work in various parts of the North China region has achieved considerable results. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, and the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin, the number of unemployed and underemployed people who have been helped to find employment by the People's Government has reached more than 300,000 (this does not include the number of people who have been helped to solve their livelihood problems through methods such as work relief and production self-rescue). Various regions have also universally established production and education centers to provide regular shelter and education for a large number of homeless children, the elderly, the weak, and the disabled. Since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the decision on labor employment issues, various regions have further attached importance to the issue of labor employment. Shanxi Province, Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan have established labor employment committees at the provincial and municipal levels, and have decided to start registration work in September. Other provinces and cities are also preparing to establish similar leadership organizations.

This newspaper reported: According to Xinhua News Agency, the Southwest Region and Wuhan City have established labor employment committees respectively. The Southwest Region Labor Employment Committee was formally established at the administrative meeting held by the Southwest Military and Political Committee on August 23. Sun Zhiyuan is the director of the committee, and Yu Jiangzhen, Cai Shufan, Chu Tunan, and Hu Zi'ang are the deputy directors.

The Wuhan City Labor Employment Committee has been formally established through the 64th administrative meeting of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government. Wang Renzhong is the chairman of the committee, and Chen Jingyu, Zhao Min, Shen Ziqian, Zhou Bin, and Peng Yan are the vice chairmen. Since the liberation of Wuhan, it has solved the labor employment problems of a large number of people. According to preliminary statistics, the Wuhan City Unemployed Workers Relief Office, the Municipal Personnel Bureau, the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Education Bureau, and the Municipal Democratic Youth Federation have solved the employment problems of more than 60,000 people. However, there are still some workers, intellectuals, former military officers, and former staff members who are in a state of unemployment or underemployment. The Wuhan City Labor Employment Committee will register these people and gradually provide them with cultural, political, and technical education in order to solve their employment problems.

    政务院华北行政委员会讨论劳动就业问题
    西南区和武汉市已分别成立劳动就业委员会
    【新华社二十八日讯】政务院华北行政委员会于八月中旬举行会议，研究了华北区当前的劳动就业问题。会议由张苏副主任传达了中央人民政府政务院关于劳动就业问题的决定后，各省市出席会议人员介绍了各地进行劳动就业工作的情况和经验。会议对失业、半失业者的登记办法、转业训练、救济办法、安置工作以及如何防止造成新的失业现象等问题，都作了详尽的讨论。张苏副主任在会议总结中指出：目前的失业问题是前进中遇到的暂时困难，随着国家经济建设的大规模发展，给解决失业问题提供了有利的条件。他认为要做好劳动就业工作，首先必须对这一问题有正确的看法，既要认识有利的条件，又要看到困难的一面。因此，必须反对急躁的情绪和消极等待的态度，要采取全面的、长期的和积极的方针，去解决劳动就业的问题。最后，他要求各地制订出工作计划，并迅速建立劳动就业委员会。
    三年多以来，华北区各地的劳动就业工作有不少成绩。据河北、山西、平原、察哈尔及北京、天津两市不完全的统计，各地失业者、半失业者经人民政府帮助就业的已达三十万人以上（采用以工代赈、生产自救等办法帮助失业者解决生活问题的人数还不包括在内）。各地并普遍举办了生产教养院，对大批流浪儿童和老弱残废的人，进行经常的收容教养工作。自中央人民政府政务院公布了关于劳动就业问题的决定后，各地对劳动就业问题已进一步引起了重视，山西省、北京、天津及唐山等市已成立了省和市一级的劳动就业委员会，并决定自九月份即着手进行登记工作，其它省、市亦正准备成立类似的领导组织机构。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西南区和武汉市已分别成立劳动就业委员会。西南区劳动就业委员会在西南军政委员会八月二十三日举行的行政会议上正式成立。该会以孙志远为主任，于江震、蔡树藩、楚图南、胡子昂为副主任。
    武汉市劳动就业委员会已经武汉市人民政府第六十四次行政会议通过正式成立。该会以王任重为主任委员，陈经畬、赵敏、申子谦、周彬、彭炎为副主任委员。武汉市自解放以来，曾解决了大批人员的劳动就业问题，据初步统计，仅经武汉市失业工人救济处、市人事局、民政局、教育局和市民主青年联合会等单位解决就业问题的就达六万余人。但目前还有一部分工人、知识分子以及旧军官、旧职员等，处于失业或半失业状态。武汉市劳动就业委员会将把这些人加以登记，逐步地予以文化、政治和技术的教育，以便解决他们的职业问题。
