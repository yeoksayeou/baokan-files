Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 12th: This agency's special correspondent comments on an international commentary published by the British Information Services on the 9th, titled "The Korean Stalemate Remains Unbroken," stating: At the armistice negotiation table, the US side is now at its wit's end, unable to come up with any new tricks to defend their unreasonable demand for the forced detention of prisoners of war. Besides repeatedly requesting adjournments, they are always "speechless" even when they do attend meetings. Outside the negotiation tent, they have plenty to say, but it all boils down to the same old tune of so-called "military pressure." And regarding the prisoner of war issue, the only obstacle to the swift realization of a truce, they are equally "speechless." To break this criminal silence, the US aggressors, unable to speak for themselves, have had to call upon their little partner, the British government, to lend a few words and find some theoretical basis for their so-called "opposition to forced repatriation" principle. It is in this context that the British Information Services, representing the views of the British government, published such an extremely absurd commentary.

The British Information Services acknowledges that after more than a year of negotiations, only the prisoner of war issue is now the problem, preventing the signing of an armistice agreement in which all clauses have been agreed upon. Needless to say, the British Information Services does not blame the US side for causing the stalemate by insisting on the forced detention of prisoners of war, but as usual, puts all the responsibility on our side. But the British Information Services cannot deny that this kind of rhetoric can no longer deceive the world. The US side's crimes of maltreating and massacring prisoners of war, and their unreasonable demand to detain prisoners of war at the expense of disrupting negotiations, have aroused opposition and condemnation from people all over the world (including the people of the United States and Britain). The British Information Services admits that now "often" people ask: Why do the governments of the United States and Britain refuse the demands of the Korean and Chinese sides? They question: Is it reasonable to allow peace in the Far East to be hindered for the sake of detaining tens of thousands of prisoners of war?

For the British government, it is indeed very difficult to answer these questions from the people of the world, especially the British people. Of course, it cannot honestly tell the British people that this is the master plan of the American bosses: the detained prisoners of war can be used as cannon fodder for aggressive wars. For example, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on August 10th, US aggressor commander Van Fleet ordered those of our captured personnel whom he unilaterally and illegally "released" to join the Rhee Syngman army. If the negotiations are delayed as a result, the American arms dealer bosses can earn more dollars in a tense international situation; if the British government is obsequious enough, it may be able to get a little share of it. But it is always necessary to come up with some ways to deceive public opinion, one cannot remain silent. Therefore, the British Information Services has found three "very pertinent reasons" for the US's so-called "opposition to forced repatriation." Now let's see if these three reasons are really "pertinent."

The first reason put forward by the British Information Services is: "For thousands and tens of thousands of ordinary people, appropriate standards of common humanity should be granted." What are the so-called "appropriate standards of common humanity?" The British Information Services, feeling guilty, dares not say. Everyone knows that the "appropriate standards of common humanity" is none other than respecting human rights, allowing everyone to reunite with their loved ones, and live a peaceful life. What our side has consistently advocated on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war is precisely this standard. And the US side's maltreatment and massacre of prisoners of war on Koje Island, forcing prisoners of war to tattoo their bodies and write pledges in blood, and forcibly detaining a large number of prisoners of war, preventing them from returning home, all these crimes violate this standard. The British Information Services' presentation of such a reason to defend the US side is precisely a slap in the face of the US side. In this sense, this slap is indeed very "pertinent."

The second reason put forward by the British Information Services is even more absurd. It said that if all prisoners of war were to be repatriated, then "the United Nations forces would have to shoot or bayonet" those so-called "prisoners of war who refuse repatriation," and it would be "simply impossible" for American or British soldiers to carry out such "barbaric and brutal tasks." What are the facts? The British government has always listened to the words of the American generals, and it certainly remembers that an American general named Colson once assured the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island in early May: "I can inform you that after you release General Dodd unharmed, we will no longer conduct forced screening or any rearming actions of prisoners of war in this prisoner of war camp, and at the same time, we will no longer conduct any screening in name only." This is enough to show that the so-called "prisoners of war who refuse repatriation" are the prisoners of war detained by the US side in preparation for rearmament. Therefore, rifles and bayonets are obviously not needed to repatriate these prisoners of war, the problem can be solved as long as the US side abandons its conspiracy to detain prisoners of war. However, the governments of the United States and Britain are unwilling to do so, and would rather order their troops to carry out "barbaric and brutal tasks." They have long used "shooting or bayoneting," plus flamethrowers and tanks, to deal with those Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who firmly demanded repatriation. On May 29, British troops, along with American troops, threw tear gas into the 66th prisoner of war camp on Koje Island, and then rushed into the prisoner of war camp, brandishing bayoneted rifles, destroying the prisoners' living quarters, and firing warning shots at prisoners who were singing collectively. In the series of bloody incidents of massacre of prisoners of war that occurred on Koje Island in June, British troops were involved! The British Information Services now pretends to be so forgetful and describes itself as so innocent, its brazenness is truly astonishing!

The British Information Services uses a distortion of the provisions of the Geneva Convention as its third reason. It first says that "the governments of the member states of the United Nations have agreed to abide by this convention, although it may not be formally binding on these governments." The British Information Services here clearly dares not openly say that the governments of the United States and Britain have not violated the Geneva Convention, so it makes such a cunning reservation from the beginning. It seems that since the Geneva Convention has no formal binding force on them, they can of course violate this convention. Then it makes a distorted interpretation of three articles in the convention, attempting to absurdly prove that if all prisoners of war are repatriated according to our demands, it would be "completely contrary" to the Geneva Convention. Like a merchant selling counterfeit goods, it asks people to "not doubt" its interpretation, because anyone with a brain will see through its lies with just a little doubt.

It first quotes Article 118 of the Convention: "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities." The British Information Services deliberately separates the event of "release and repatriation" into two separate things, "release" and "repatriation," and makes a big fuss about the "release" issue, while leaving "repatriation" aside. According to the interpretation of the British Information Services, prisoners of war should first be released, so that they are "no longer prisoners of war" but "free men." In other words, there would be full justification for detaining them to serve as cannon fodder. This interpretation is obviously in no way similar to the provisions of the Geneva Convention. According to the Geneva Convention, the "release and repatriation" of prisoners of war is one thing, that is, the release and repatriation of all prisoners of war to their homes. The British Information Services did not look at the fact that Article 118 stipulates the "release and repatriation of prisoners of war," not the "release of prisoners of war and the detention of 'free men'" as it hoped. Such an attitude of speaking nonsense and talking nonsense, appearing in a commentary published by a national official organ, cannot but be surprising.

Based on this utterly absurd distortion of Article 118, the British Information Services then quotes Article 6 of the Geneva Convention, which stipulates that no special agreement shall adversely affect the rights of prisoners of war as defined by the present Convention. The British Information Services said: Therefore, the right of prisoners of war to "be released" must not be restricted. But what are the rights of prisoners of war stipulated by the Geneva Convention? This is that when they are still in the enemy's prisoner of war camp, they should be treated humanely, and when the hostilities between the two sides end, they should be immediately released and repatriated home. Our position is precisely to protect this right of prisoners of war; and it is the US side that wants to use special agreements to restrict the right of prisoners of war to be released and repatriated. The British Information Services' attempt to conceal the truth, falsely claiming the right to not restrict the right of prisoners of war to "be released," while actually restricting the right of prisoners of war to be repatriated, is extremely despicable.

Finally, the British Information Services mentioned Article 46 of the Convention. This article stipulates that if the detaining Power decides to transfer prisoners of war to another place after they have arrived at the prisoner of war camp, it shall take into consideration the interests of the prisoners themselves, and in particular shall avoid increasing the difficulties of their repatriation, and stipulates that the transfer should always be humane. Article 119 of the Convention stipulates that the repatriation of prisoners of war should also be carried out under such conditions. Article 46 stipulates only the technical issues of transferring and repatriating prisoners of war, for the purpose of implementing the principle of repatriating prisoners of war. The British Information Services here is clearly at its wits' end, racking its brains, trying to rape the articles, confuse right and wrong, and deceive public opinion. The British Information Services describes the US side's crimes of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and forcing them to serve as cannon fodder for Rhee Syngman and Chiang Kai-shek as protecting the "individual rights" of prisoners of war and ensuring that prisoners of war receive "humane treatment." Such nonsense has long been refuted by the countless massacres in the US prisoner of war camps on Koje Island and Colson's confession. The British Information Services is still taking out this rag to cover up the US side's ugliness, indicating that it has reached the end of its rope.

On the one hand, the British government blindly follows the US war policy, lowering the living standards of the British people, and recently has been trying to freeze workers' wages. On the other hand, it wants to use its official propaganda organs to shamelessly defend the US side's unreasonable demands, hoping to deceive the British people. This will not achieve its purpose. The British government's slavish attempt to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the US side, no matter what alms it may get from its Wall Street bosses, cannot find the slightest reason for the US's plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and cannot find any excuse for the Anglo-American violation of the Geneva Convention and inhumane treatment of prisoners of war. On the contrary, this will only further expose the ugly accomplice face of the Churchill government in front of the British people and the people of the world.

### 新华社记者  评英国新闻处为美方扣留战俘辩护的谬论

    评英国新闻处为美方扣留战俘辩护的谬论
    【新华社开城十二日电】本社特派记者评论英国新闻处在九日发表的一篇题为“朝鲜的僵局仍然没有打破”的国际评论说：在停战谈判的会议桌上，美方现在已经理屈词穷，想不出什么新花样来替他们强迫扣留战俘的无理主张辩护了。他们除了一再要求休会以外，即使来开会也总是“无话可说”。在会议帐篷外面，他们的话虽然不少，但是说来说去，无非是所谓“军事压力”的老调而已。而关于唯一障碍停战迅速实现的战俘问题，他们也同样是
    “无话可说”的。为了打破这种犯罪的沉默，自己无话可说的美国侵略者只好请出他的小伙计英国政府来给他帮几句腔，替他的所谓“反对强迫遣返”的原则找一些理论上的根据。就在这种情况下，代表英国政府意见的英国新闻处发表了这样的一篇极端荒谬的评论。
    英国新闻处承认在谈判进行了一年多以后，现在只是一个战俘问题在作怪，以致所有条文都已商妥的停战协定不能签字。不用说，英国新闻处决不责怪因为坚持强迫扣留战俘而使谈判陷于僵局的美方，而照例地把责任一古脑儿推给我方。但是英国新闻处不能不承认，这种花言巧语的伎俩已经欺骗不了世界。美方的虐待和屠杀战俘的罪行，以及他们的不惜破坏谈判而要扣留战俘的无理主张，已经引起了全世界人民（包括美国和英国的人民）的反对和责难。英国新闻处承认，现在“常常”有人要问：为什么美国和英国的政府要拒绝朝中方面的要求？他们责问说：为了扣留几万名战俘而让远东和平受到障碍，难道是合理的吗？
    在英国政府说来，要回答世界人民，特别是英国人民的这些责问，的确是很为难的。它当然不能老老实实地告诉英国人民，说这是美国老板们的锦囊妙计：扣留下来的战俘可以充当侵略战争的炮灰，例如根据美联社汉城八月十日电，美国侵略军司令范佛里特在他片面非法地“释放”我方被俘人员时，就命令他们去参加李承晚的军队。如果谈判因此而拖延下去，美国军火商老板们就可以在紧张的国际局势中赚更多的美元；英国政府如果巴结得好，或许还可以从这里面分得一点。但是总要想出
    一些办法来欺骗舆论，总不能沉默下去的。因此英国新闻处为美国的所谓“反对强迫遣返”找出了三点“十分中肯的理由”。现在我们来看看这三点理由究竟是否“中肯”吧。
    英国新闻处提出的第一个理由是：“对于几千几万普通人，应该给予人类共同的适当标准的待遇。”所谓“人类共同的适当标准”是什么呢？英国新闻处作贼心虚地不敢说出来。谁都知道，“人类共同的适当标准”不是别的，就是要尊重人权，要使每个人都能和他们的亲人团聚，能过和平生活。我方在遣返战俘问题上所一贯主张的恰恰就是这一个标准。而美方在巨济岛上虐待和屠杀战俘，强迫战俘在身上刺字和写血书，硬要扣留大批战俘，不让他们回家，所有这些罪恶行为无一不是违反了这个标准。英国新闻处提出这样一个理由来替美方辩护，恰好打了美方一记嘴巴。在这个意义上说来，这记嘴巴打得的确是很“中肯”的。
    英国新闻处提出的第二个理由就更荒唐了。它说，如果要遣返全部战俘，那末“联合国军就得开枪射击或者用枪刺去对付”那些所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘，而要美国或英国的士兵去执行这样“野蛮和凶残的任务”，“简直是不可能的”。事实是怎么样的呢？英国政府一向是听从美国的将军们的话的，它当然记得有一位名叫柯尔生的美国将军曾经在五月初向巨济岛上的朝中战俘保证说：“我可以通知你们，在你们不加伤害地释放了杜德将军以后，我们不再对这个战俘营里的战俘进行强迫甄别或任何重新武装的行动，同时不再进行任何有名无实的甄别。”这就已经足够说明所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘，就是美方扣留下来准备加以重新武装的战俘。因此要遣返这些战俘，步枪和刺刀显然是用不着的，只要美方放弃扣留战俘的阴谋，就可以解决问题。但是，美国和英国的政府都不愿这样做，而宁愿叫它们的军队去执行“野蛮和凶残的任务”，它们早就已经用“开枪射击或者用枪刺”，还加上喷火器和坦克，去对付那些坚决要求遣返的朝中战俘。五月二十九日，英国军队曾经和美国军队一起向巨济岛上的六十六号战俘营投掷催泪弹，然后又挥舞着上了刺刀的步枪冲进战俘营，捣毁战俘们的住室，并且向集体唱歌的战俘鸣枪威吓。在六月份巨济岛上发生的一连串屠杀战俘的流血事件中，都有英国军队的份！英国新闻处现在装得如此健忘，把自己说得如此清白，其厚颜无耻的程度实在是可惊的！
    英国新闻处用对日内瓦公约条文的曲解来作为它的第三个理由。它首先说“联合国诸会员国政府是曾经同意遵守这一公约的，虽然它对于这些政府也许并无正式的约束力”。英国新闻处在这里显然不敢公然说美国和英国政府没有违反日内瓦公约，因此一开始就作了这样一个狡猾的保留。似乎日内瓦公约对他们既无正式约束力，他们当然可以违反这个公约。接着它对公约中的三条条文作了歪曲的解释，企图荒谬地证明如果按照我方要求遣返全部战俘，就会“全然违背”日内瓦公约。它像贩卖假货色的商人似的要求人们对于它所作的解释“毋庸怀疑”，因为任何有头脑的人只要稍为怀疑一下，就会拆穿它的鬼话的。
    它首先引用了公约第一一八条：“在积极的敌对行动停止以后，应立即释放与遣返战俘。”英国新闻处故意把“释放与遣返”这一件事割裂为“释放”与“遣返”两回事，并且在“释放”问题上大做文章，而把“遣返”丢在一边。按照英国新闻处的解释，战俘应该首先予以释放，这样他们就“不再是战俘”而是“自由人”了，换句话说，就可以完全有理由把他们扣留下来充当炮灰了。这种解释显然与日内瓦公约的条文毫无相同之处。按照日内瓦公约的规定，战俘的“释放与遣返”是一件事情，就是释放并遣返全部战俘回家。英国新闻处没有看一看，在一一八条中规定的是“释放与遣返战俘”，而不是如它所希望的“释放战俘与扣留‘自由人’”。这种信口开河、胡说八道的态度，见之于一个国家的官方机关所发表的评论中，实在不能不令人惊异。
    根据这种荒谬绝伦的对第一一八条的曲解，英国新闻处接着又引用了日内瓦公约第六条，这一条中规定任何特别协定都不得限制公约所赋予战俘的权利。英国新闻处说：因此，不得限制战俘的“被释放”的权利。但是日内瓦公约规定的战俘的权利是什么呢？这就是当他们还在敌方战俘营中时，他们应当受到人道待遇，而当双方敌对行为结束时，他们应当被立即释放与遣返回家。我方的主张正是为了保护战俘的这种权利；而想用特别协定来限制战俘的被释放与遣返的权利的恰恰就是美方。英国新闻处企图用遮遮掩掩的手法，假不得限制战俘“被释放”权利之名，而行限制战俘被遣返权利之实，实在卑鄙已极。
    最后，英国新闻处提到公约第四十六条。这一条规定战俘在到达战俘营以后，收容国如决定移送战俘于他处，须考虑战俘本身的利益，尤其应该避免增加他们遣返的困难，并且规定移送应该永远是合乎人道的。公约第一一九条规定，遣返战俘也应该在这种条件下进行。第四十六条所规定的只是移送与遣返战俘的技术问题，为的是实施遣返战俘的原则的。英国新闻处在这里显然是穷极无聊，挖空心思，企图强奸条文，混淆是非，借以欺骗舆论。英国新闻处把美方强迫扣留战俘并强令他们替李承晚、蒋介石充当炮灰的罪行说成是为了保护战俘“个人权利”，保障战俘受到“人道待遇”。这种谰言早就被巨济岛上美方战俘营中的无数次屠杀事件和柯尔生的供词驳得一文不值了。英国新闻处到现在还拿出这块破布来给美方遮丑，说明它已经到了黔驴技穷的地步。
    英国政府一方面一味追随美国的战争政策，压低英国人民的生活水准，最近并又在企图冻结工人的工资，另一方面则想通过其官方宣传机关来这样无耻地为美方的无理要求辩护，希图欺骗英国人民。这是达不到目的的。英国政府这种奴颜婢膝地为美方火中取栗的做法，不管它可能从它的华尔街老板那里得到什么施舍，总不能为美国的强迫扣留战俘的方案找到半点理由，总不能替美英合伙违反日内瓦公约和对待战俘的惨无人道的罪行找到任何口实，相反的，这只有在英国人民和全世界人民面前，进一步暴露了邱吉尔政府的丑恶的帮凶的脸嘴而已。
