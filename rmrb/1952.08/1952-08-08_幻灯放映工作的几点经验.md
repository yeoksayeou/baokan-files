    Some Experiences in Lantern Slide Projection Work
    Comrade Editor: Linjin County, Shanxi Province, is vigorously carrying out lantern slide projection work in rural areas. So far, twelve lantern slide stations have been established, and the activities of the lantern slide stations are mostly within a radius of ten li. According to the statistics for April, May, and June of this year alone, the stations have shown slides a total of sixty-eight times, with 31,000 viewers. The lantern slides shown included twenty-five types such as "The Leaping Forward New China" and "How the Volunteer Army Captured American Soldiers Alive." Lantern slide projection has been enthusiastically welcomed by the peasant masses, who say, "The 'local movies' are really not bad. They can tell people about current affairs and policies, and they are really a good thing for stimulating the mind."
    The Linjin County People's Cultural Center has gained the following experience in establishing rural lantern slide stations: First, before promotion, demonstration screenings should be carried out in a planned way to attract the attention of cadres and the masses. Second, slides should be supplied in a timely manner, and the content should be fresh and practical. This is an important link in consolidating and developing lantern slide stations. If the slides are not supplied in time or are always the same one or two, the masses will get tired of watching them and feel that "it's not interesting." In order to avoid the above situation, the People's Cultural Center purchased a large number of slides in Beijing, Shanghai, Taiyuan and other places, and established a slide exchange system between stations. Comrades from the Cultural Center also combined the local situation and used glassine paper to mimeograph a set of lantern slides every day to supply to each station. In addition, each station also organized some amateur painters to introduce the model figures and model deeds of their villages. In this way, the problem of slide supply was solved. Third, the screenings should be colorful and audible so that the masses will enjoy watching them. The music should be able to change with the content of the slides. When the Chengdong Lantern Slide Station showed slides, it used a storytelling format for explanation. The masses reflected that "We listened to the music and watched the movie. This is much better than watching a play (referring to old plays)." Fourth, the content of the slides should pay attention to the storyline. The stronger the storyline, the more popular it is with the masses. Without continuous pictures, the masses do not have a deep impression after watching them and do not like to watch them very much. Fifth, the Cultural Center should establish a sound system, hold lantern slide conferences regularly, exchange slides and experiences between stations. Staff should also go to the countryside regularly to demonstrate guidance and help solve difficult problems.   Linjin County Cultural Center, Shanxi Province    Du Bo

    幻灯放映工作的几点经验
    编辑同志：山西临晋县正在大力开展农村幻灯放映工作。到现在为止，已经建立了十二座幻灯站，幻灯站的活动大都在附近十里的范围内。单就今年四月、五月、六月三个月的统计，各站共放映了六十八次，观众三万一千人。放映的幻灯片有“飞跃前进的新中国”、“志愿军是怎样活捉美国兵的”等二十五种。幻灯放映受到了农民群众热烈的欢迎，他们说：“土电影”可真不差，能告诉人们时事政策，真是个开动脑筋的好东西。
    临晋县人民文化馆在建立农村幻灯站的工作中，摸索到下面几点经验：一、推广以前，要有计划地进行示范放映，以引起干部和群众的注意。二、片子要及时供应，内容要新鲜、切合实际。这是巩固和发展幻灯站的重要一环。片子供应不上或老是原来的一两部，群众会看腻的，觉得“没有意思”。为了避免上述情况，人民文化馆在北京、上海、太原等地购买了大批片子，并且在站与站之间建立了片子交换制度。文化馆工作同志又结合当地情况，每日用玻璃纸石印幻灯片一套，供应各站。另外，每站还组织了一些业余画家，介绍本村的模范人物和模范事迹。这样，便解决了片子的供应问题。三、放映时要有色有声，使群众喜看爱看。音乐要能随片子内容的变化而变化。城东幻灯站放映片子时，用说唱形式作说明，群众反映说：“曲子也听啦，电影也看啦，这比看戏（指老戏）好得多。”四、片子的内容，应注意故事性，故事性越强，越受群众欢迎。没有连续性的画幅，群众看了印象不深，不大爱看。五、文化馆要建立健全的制度，定期举行幻灯会议，各站互换片子，交流经验。工作人员还要经常下乡示范督导，帮助解决困难问题。   山西临晋县文化馆    杜波
