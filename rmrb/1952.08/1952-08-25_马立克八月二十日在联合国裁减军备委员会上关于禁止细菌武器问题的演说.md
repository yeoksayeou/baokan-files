Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 22nd: On August 20th, Soviet representative Malik delivered a speech at the United Nations Disarmament Commission meeting on the issue of prohibiting bacteriological weapons.

Malik pointed out: The speech made by the U.S. representative at the United Nations Disarmament Commission on August 15th was merely another attempt by the U.S. government to justify and conceal its refusal to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol regarding the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, and its refusal to abide by this protocol, which has become a recognized and important international legal norm prohibiting bacteriological warfare.

The Geneva Protocol has been signed by forty-eight countries, of which forty-two have officially ratified it. Only six countries, led by the United States, have not yet ratified the Geneva Protocol.

The attitude adopted by the United States on this issue is the same as that adopted by Japanese militarists. The Japanese militarists refused to ratify this international agreement prohibiting bacteriological weapons because they were preparing for aggression and war at the time.

During the trial of Japanese war criminals in Khabarovsk in December 1949, all documents irrefutably proved that Japanese militarists not only prepared bacteriological weapons but also used them against the Mongolian People's Republic, the Soviet Union, and China. Malik said: These historical facts all illustrate that those who take the path of aggression and prepare for war avoid ratifying the Geneva Protocol prohibiting bacteriological weapons.

The U.S. ruling clique has adopted the same attitude on this issue.

The United States has avoided ratifying the Geneva Protocol for more than twenty years since signing it.

U.S. representatives argued that the United States adopted an isolationist policy after the First World War and therefore did not ratify the Geneva Protocol. This explanation is not worth refuting.

Facts recorded in official documents of the U.S. Congress prove that the real reason why the United States did not ratify the Geneva Protocol before the Second World War was not "isolationism" but imperialism—because the U.S. ruling clique attempted to prepare a weapon of mass destruction and use it to wage war against all countries and peoples they distrusted. Their plan stemmed from a shameless and cruel idea: that this weapon could kill more people and cost less money.

Based on the above reasons, the U.S. ruling clique had long avoided ratifying the Geneva Protocol before the Second World War. In April 1947, after the war, they openly tore off all pretense and formally removed the issue of ratifying the Geneva Protocol prohibiting bacteriological weapons from the Senate's agenda. The U.S. ruling clique openly pursued a policy of aggression and preparation for a Third World War and announced their official policy of striving for world leadership (the so-called striving for world leadership is to establish a "position of strength," implement "power politics" to strive for hegemony in dominating the world). They said without concealment that they refused to ratify the Geneva Protocol and insisted that it was outdated.

The Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use of weapons of mass destruction, is a major obstacle to their policy of aggression and preparation for another world war.

All these well-known facts fully expose the arguments that the U.S. representative to the United Nations wants to use to justify and conceal the U.S. attitude as untenable. In the eyes of every fair and objective person, it is very clear that what has obstructed the United States from ratifying the Geneva Protocol in the past and present is not "isolationism" but imperialism.

Malik continued: Facts have proven that the United States has long embarked on the path of preparing for bacteriological warfare. According to materials from American newspapers and statements from American officials, the whole world knows that the U.S. government has been carrying out and is still carrying out a broad plan to prepare for bacteriological warfare. This plan includes: extensively utilizing scientific research on various bacteriological weapons, researching the use of certain bacteria as weapons for mass slaughter of people, greatly increasing the construction of laboratories, and conducting experiments both domestically and abroad to test the effectiveness of bacteriological weapons.

All of this is proven not only by news reports but also by official statements and documents.

Malik then cited a report from a subcommittee meeting of the House Appropriations Committee as an example. At this meeting, General Bullene, Commander of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, requested a significant increase in funding for research and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction in the U.S. military budget for 1953, citing the need to complete the tasks assigned to the Chemical Corps by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. He also said that the appropriation applied for in 1953 exceeded the expenses incurred in 1951 and 1952.

Representative Riley, a member of the House Appropriations Committee subcommittee, asked him why the funding for bacteriological warfare was being increased. Bullene replied: There are two reasons. He said: First, this matter has received greater attention, and people are taking this work more seriously. Second, many new laboratories have been established, and work will be carried out on a larger scale next year. Laboratories in some places are still under construction.

Representative Floyd, another member of the subcommittee, asked him whether great attention had been paid to "research" on bacteriological and chemical warfare. Bullene's answer was affirmative. He said: People consider this a very urgent matter. Research work has been going on for ten years, and now is the time to mass-produce things that can be used as weapons.

Representative Sykes, Chairman of the subcommittee, said: As reported in the newspapers, the purpose of the bacteriological warfare research program is to enable the United States to conduct this war on the other shore.

Malik continued: The above words of U.S. officials prove that the United States has been extensively preparing for bacteriological warfare. This is also proven by the words of General Armstrong, Deputy Surgeon General of the U.S. Army Medical Department. In a speech he gave to the U.S. Army Medical Corps on February 11 this year regarding scientific research, he said: A novel type of research is now being carried out in the military field, specifically research on atomic, chemical, biological, and radiation warfare. The scale of this research program is unprecedented. Armstrong also admitted that some troops have been dispatched for field research, especially in foreign countries. He said: These troops are mainly working in Korea and Japan.

In addition, officials have confirmed that U.S. aggressors not only used bacteriological weapons but also dispatched special Army medical teams to Korea to check the effectiveness of this weapon of mass destruction.

While preparing for the extensive use of bacteriological weapons, the U.S. ruling clique is actively influencing the psychology and opinion of the American people, making them believe that the use of this base and vicious weapon is justified.

First of all, they are making every effort in newspapers and in the United Nations to overturn a long-established belief of the people of European countries and the world: that the use of weapons of mass destruction, especially bacteriological weapons, is base and inhuman.

A campaign is now openly underway to create confusion among the American people on this issue. They are trying to convince the American people that the use of bacteriological weapons is "humane." None other than General Bullene said in Dallas on March 31 this year: If it is necessary to kill the enemy, using poison gas and other chemical weapons is the most humane and cheapest.

General Bullene also said that poison gas does not destroy materials, it only destroys people and labor, so it is more advantageous to use poison gas for warfare. The words of this American general reveal the intention of the ruling clique: to destroy as many people as possible, but to preserve the materials belonging to these people, in order to plunder these materials for their own use.

From the words of Lieutenant Colonel Hays, chief of the finance department of the U.S. Chemical Corps, we can know the scale of the preparation work for weapons of mass destruction that is being carried out. At a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee subcommittee on January 31, 1950, Lieutenant Colonel Hays said that the value of the materials currently stored for the U.S. armed forces to use for chemical warfare is estimated to be approximately $1.5 billion.

Next, Malik cited an article by U.S. military expert Baldwin published in the February 1950 issue of "The Atlantic Monthly." Mr. Baldwin wrote about U.S. policy: "But to others, our record is not clean, and objective history cannot conceal this. We have rarely advocated limiting terror; we have almost never supported the faint calls for limiting war. We have not ratified the 1899 Hague Convention prohibiting the use of dumdum bullets in war. We have also never ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons and poison gas... The blinding flash over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, was the culmination of the United States' practice of using any means to achieve its goals. On this day, we joined the ranks of those who use new weapons of terror to exterminate mankind... We desperately engage in total war, and we do our best to make this war all-encompassing..."

Next, Malik exposed the claim made by the U.S. representative that there are various technical difficulties in using bacteriological weapons, and that it is also difficult to manufacture bacteriological weapons, so it is impossible for the U.S. armed forces to use bacteriological weapons as untenable.

Firstly, there is enough material to deny and refute this statement in American newspapers, special articles, and official speeches.

Malik continued: It is already very clear that while the United States refuses to ratify the Geneva Protocol and pursues a policy of expanding armaments and preparing for a new war, it is also conducting a frenzied campaign to manufacture bacteriological weapons and prepare for bacteriological warfare.

Malik said: The United Nations, especially the United Nations Disarmament Commission, cannot turn a blind eye to reality, nor can it ignore these facts. The urgency of this issue is also very clear, because the U.S. armed forces are currently using bacteriological weapons, thereby blatantly violating international agreements.

The recent International Red Cross Conference has confirmed that the whole world opposes the U.S. policy on this issue.

Malik pointed out: The International Red Cross Conference paid special attention to the fact that some governments have not ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting bacteriological weapons and expressed shock at this. The conference said in its resolution: The conference firmly believes that all governments that have not yet acceded to or ratified the aforementioned protocol should accede to or ratify this protocol. The conference called on national Red Cross societies to appeal to the governments of all countries that have not yet ratified the Geneva Protocol to ratify this protocol in the shortest possible time. This is the essence of the issue.

On important international issues directly related to peace and war, the U.S. ruling clique has been completely isolated. In front of the people of the whole world, they are very isolated. They alone oppose the prohibition of bacteriological warfare, and they alone are preparing for and launching bacteriological warfare. The committee cannot ignore this fact and cannot ignore this international issue that is of vital importance to the cause of peace. The committee must immediately study the issue of prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons and destroying the prohibition of bacteriological warfare, and study the issue of punishing violators of the prohibition of bacteriological warfare.

On the one hand, the U.S. government and its representatives in the United Nations agencies are trying to deny that the U.S. military is using bacteriological weapons. On the other hand, they refuse to express opposition to the use of these weapons and refuse to condemn this heinous way of war...

The committee must immediately discuss the issue of bacteriological weapons and authoritatively express in the name of the United Nations that it is in favor of immediately condemning bacteriological warfare and stopping these shameful war crimes.

The sole purpose of the U.S. representative in resuming the discussion of the bacteriological weapons issue in the Disarmament Commission is to justify and conceal the U.S. ruling clique's refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol prohibiting bacteriological weapons.

It is very obvious that the publication of this speech, like previous official statements from the United States, is because the U.S. ruling clique hopes to be free to continue using these shameful bacteriological weapons.

The most convincing evidence of this is the well-known fact that throughout the entire process of discussing the issue of the use of bacteriological weapons, the U.S. government has consistently refused to condemn bacteriological warfare. In March of this year, the U.S. government undermined the discussion of the bacteriological weapons issue in the United Nations Disarmament Commission and obstructed the passage of the proposal submitted by the Soviet Union to call on all countries that have not yet acceded to or ratified the Geneva Protocol to immediately accede to or ratify this protocol. The U.S. representative did everything possible to slander the Geneva Protocol, which declares bacteriological weapons illegal. He completely failed, because all members of the Security Council who have ratified the Geneva Protocol have once again expressed their commitment to the obligations stipulated in the Geneva Protocol. Therefore, on this issue, the United States has been morally and politically isolated and has suffered a defeat.

The U.S. government has also tried every possible means to prevent the International Red Cross Conference from passing a resolution on ratifying the Geneva Protocol. This attempt also failed.

Under these circumstances, the U.S. representative was forced to issue a statement at the United Nations Disarmament Commission, once again attempting to conceal and justify the U.S.'s refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol. In fact, this statement is equivalent to the United States formally refusing to ratify the Geneva Protocol at the United Nations Committee meeting, openly declaring the U.S.'s aggressive intentions to use bacteriological weapons and conduct bacteriological warfare; and that is exactly how people think of it.

There is no doubt that there will not be a single honest person in the whole world who will support the attitude of those who are preparing to use shameful and base bacteriological weapons and are preparing to launch a criminal bacteriological war. The United Nations Disarmament Commission cannot ignore this important international issue either. The direct responsibility of the Disarmament Commission is to study the issue of prohibiting bacteriological weapons and to do its best to take all measures to ensure that the recognized international legal norms prohibiting bacteriological weapons stipulated in the Geneva Protocol ratified by forty-two countries can be strictly and accurately fulfilled and observed. This is one of the most important tasks and direct responsibilities of the Disarmament Commission. In line with this noble humanitarian principle, and in an effort to strive for the consolidation of peace and international security, the Soviet delegation suggests that the committee discuss the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union: to prohibit the use of bacteriological weapons, to prevent the destruction of the bacteriological warfare prohibition, and to punish violators of this prohibition.

    马立克八月二十日在联合国裁减军备委员会上关于禁止细菌武器问题的演说
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日电：八月二十日，苏联代表马立克在联合国裁减军备委员会会议上就禁止细菌武器问题发表演说。
    马立克指出：美国代表八月十五日在联合国裁减军备委员会上的发言只是美国政府再度为它拒绝批准一九二五年关于禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书和拒绝遵守这个议定书进行辩解和掩饰的企图，而这个议定书已成为一个公认的禁止进行细菌战的重要国际法准则。
    日内瓦议定书是由四十八个国家签订的，其中已有四十二个国家正式批准这个议定书。只有以美国为首的六国尚没有批准日内瓦议定书。
    美国在这个问题上所采取的态度与日本军国主义分子采取的态度是一样的。日本军国主义分子不肯批准这个禁止细菌武器的国际协定，因为他们当时正在准备侵略和战争。
    一九四九年十二月在伯力审判日本战争罪犯的时候，一切文件都无可辩驳地证明了日本军国主义者不仅准备细菌武器，而且还对蒙古人民共和国、苏联和中国使用了这种武器。马立克说：这些历史的事实都说明那些采取侵略道路和进行战争准备的人们都避不批准禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。
    美国统治集团在这个问题上也采取了同样的态度。
    美国自从在日内瓦议定书上签字后，二十多年以来一直避不批准这个议定书。
    美国代表们辩解说：自从第一次世界大战之后，美国便采取了孤立主义政策，因此没有批准日内瓦议定书。这种解释是不值一驳的。
    美国国会的正式文件中所记载的事实证明：美国在第二次世界大战以前不批准日内瓦议定书的真正理由并不是“孤立主义”，而是帝国主义——是因为美国统治集团企图准备一种大规模杀人的武器，并用它来对他们所不信任的一切国家和人民进行战争。他们这种打算是从一种无耻的、残忍的想法出发的，即：这种武器可以多杀人，少花钱。
    美国统治集团根据上述的理由，在第二次世界大战以前曾长期避不批准日内瓦议定书。到了战后的一九四七年四月便公然撕毁了一切假面具，正式把批准禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书问题从参议院的议程中撤销了。美国统治集团公开地实行侵略和准备第三次世界大战的政策，并且宣布他们争取世界领导权的正式政策（所谓争取世界领导权就是建立“有实力的局面”、实行“强权政治”以争取统治世界的霸权），他们就不加隐讳地说：他们拒绝批准日内瓦议定书，并硬说它已经过时了。
    禁止使用大规模杀人武器的日内瓦议定书，是他们的侵略政策和准备另一次世界大战的政策的一大障碍。
    所有这些人人知道的事实，充分揭穿了美国驻联合国的代表想为美国的态度辩解和掩饰的论据都是站不住脚的。在每一位公正客观的人士看来，过去和现在阻挠美国批准日内瓦议定书的不是什么“孤立主义”，而是帝国主义，这一点是十分明显的。
    马立克继续说道：事实都证明：美国早就走上了准备细菌战的道路。根据美国报纸的材料以及美国官员的声明，全世界都知道美国政府已经进行而且仍在继续进行一个准备细菌战争的广泛计划。这个计划包括：广泛地利用科学研究各种各样的细菌武器，研究利用某些细菌作为大规模屠杀人民的武器，大大地增建实验室，并在国内外进行实验以检查细菌武器的效力。
    所有这一切不仅从报上的消息得到证明，而且从官方的声明和文件中也得到证明。
    马立克然后引证了关于众议院拨款委员会的小组委员会会议的一个报告为例。美国陆军部化学兵团司令布伦将军在这个会议上，以必须完成美国参谋长联席会议交给化学兵团的任务为理由，要求在美国一九五三年的军事预算中，大大增加研究和制造大规模杀人武器的拨款。他还说：为一九五三年所申请的拨款超过了一九五一年和一九五二年所花的费用。
    众议院拨款委员会小组委员会委员、众议员里雷问他，为什么要增加细菌战的拨款。布伦回答说：有两项理由。他说：第一，这件事情已获得更大的注意，人们已更严重地看待这种工作。第二，许多新的实验室已经成立，明年就要更大规模地进行工作。某些地方的实验室还在建造之中。
    小组委员会另一位委员、众议员佛勒德问他：在关于细菌战和化学战的“研究”方面是否已给予很大的注意。布伦的回答是肯定的，他说：人们认为这是一件非常迫切的事情，研究工作已经进行了十年之久，现在已经到了大批生产可以用作武器的东西的时候了。
    小组委员会主席、众议员赛克斯说：正如报纸所报道的，细菌战的研究计划的目的是使美国得以在彼岸进行这种战争。
    马立克继续说道：美国官员以上这些话，证明了美国已在广泛进行细菌战的准备工作。美国陆军部军医署副署长阿姆斯特朗将军的话也证明了这一点。他在今年二月十一日对美军军医团发表一篇关于科学研究的演说，他说：现在正在军事方面进行一种新颖的研究，具体说来，就是进行原子、化学、生物、辐射线战争的研究。这个研究计划规模之大是空前的。阿姆斯特朗并且承认：已派出一些部队进行实地研究，特别是在国外进行这种研究。他说：这些部队主要是在朝鲜和日本进行工作。
    另外，官方并证实了美国侵略者不仅使用细菌武器，而且还派遣特别陆军医疗队到朝鲜去检查这种大规模杀人武器的效验。
    美国统治集团在准备广泛使用细菌武器的时候，正积极地影响美国人民的心理和舆论，使他们认为这种卑鄙恶毒的武器的使用是有道理的。
    首先，他们正在报纸上和联合国里面竭力推翻欧洲各国和全世界各国人民的一种久已确定的信念：使用大规模杀人的武器，特别是细菌武器，是卑鄙和残无人道的。
    现在正在公开进行使美国人民在这个问题上发生模糊观念的运动。他们企图使美国人民相信使用细菌武器是“合乎人道的”。不是别人，就是这个布伦将军于今年三月三十一日在达拉斯城说：如果需要杀死敌人的话，用毒气与其他化学武器是最人道与最廉价的。
    这个布伦将军还说：毒气并不毁灭物资，只是毁灭人民与劳动力，所以利用毒气进行战争更为有利。这位美国将军的话就暴露了统治集团的意图是：尽可能毁灭大量的人民，但要保存属于这些人民的物资，以便掠夺这些物资，以供己用。
    从美国化学兵团财务处处长海斯中校的话中，可以知道正在进行的大规模杀人武器的准备工作的规模。海斯中校在一九五○年一月三十一日在众议院拨款委员会的小组委员会上说：目前供美国武装部队用来进行化学战争的储存物资价值估计约为十五亿美元。
    接着马立克引证美国军事专家鲍尔温刊载在一九五○年二月的“大西洋月刊”上的文章。鲍尔温先生写到美国的政策时说：“但在别人看来，我们的纪录是很不清白的，而客观的历史也不能掩饰这一点。我们很少主张限制恐怖；对于限制战争的微弱的呼声，我们几乎是从来不曾加以声援的。我们并未批准一八九九年关于禁止在战争中使用达姆弹的海牙公约。我们也从未批准一九二五年关于禁止在战争中使用细菌武器和毒气的日内瓦议定书。……一九四五年八月六日，广岛上空眩目的一闪，是美国为了达到目的可以不择手段的做法到了登峰造极的地步的表现。在这一天，我们加入了使用新的恐怖武器来灭绝人类的那些人的行列中，……我们拚命地进行总体战争，我们尽了我们最大的力量来使这种战争无所不包，……”
    接着，马立克揭露美国代表所说的使用细菌武器有各种技术上的困难、制造细菌武器也有困难、因而美国武装部队不可能使用细菌武器这种说法是站不住脚的。
    首先在美国的报纸、专文与官方发言中就可以找到足以否认与驳斥这个说法的东西。
    马立克继续说：这已很明显了：美国一面拒绝批准日内瓦议定书及奉行扩充军备与准备新战争的政策，同时却在进行制造细菌武器的狂热运动，准备细菌战。
    马立克说：联合国、特别是联合国裁减军备委员会，不能对现实视若无睹，也不能忽视这些事实。这个问题的迫切性也是很明显的，因为美国武装部队目前已在使用细菌武器，从而彰明较著地破坏了国际协议。
    最近的国际红十字大会已证实了全世界都反对美国在这个问题上的政策。
    马立克指出：国际红十字大会特别注意到若干政府还没有批准禁止细菌武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书，并对此表示震惊。大会在决议中说：大会坚决认为：一切尚未参加或批准上述议定书的政府应该参加或批准这个议定书。大会号召各国红十字会呼吁一切尚未批准日内瓦议定书的国家的政府在最短期内批准这个议定书。这是问题的本质。
    在直接与和平和战争有关的重要的国际问题上，美国统治集团已完全孤立了。在全世界人民面前，他们十分孤立，只有他们反对禁止细菌战，只有他们在准备与发动细菌战。委员会不能忽视这个事实，不能忽视这个对和平事业至关重要的国际问题。委员会必须立即研究禁止使用细菌武器和破坏细菌战禁令的问题，并研究惩罚细菌战禁令违反者的问题。
    美国政府与它在联合国机构中的代表们，一方面竭力矢口否认美国军队使用细菌武器，另一方面却拒绝表示反对使用这些武器并拒绝谴责这个罪恶的战争方式……。
    委员会必须立即讨论细菌武器的问题，并以联合国的名义，权威地表示它赞成立即谴责细菌战，制止这些可耻的战争罪行。
    美国代表在裁减军备委员会中恢复讨论细菌武器问题的唯一目的，是要为美国统治集团拒绝批准禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书一举辩护和掩饰。
    十分明显，这篇演说的发表，像美国历次官方声明一样，是由于美国统治集团希望让他们自由地继续使用这些可耻的细菌武器。
    关于这一点，最具有说服力的证据就是这样一个人所共知的事实：在讨论使用细菌武器的问题的整个过程中，美国政府自始至终拒绝谴责细菌战。在今年三月间，美国政府破坏联合国裁减军备委员会关于细菌武器问题的讨论，并阻挠通过苏联所提出的关于呼吁所有尚未参加或批准日内瓦议定书的国家立即参加或批准这个议定书的提案。美国代表竭尽一切力量，诽谤宣布细菌武器为非法的日内瓦议定书。他彻底地失败了，因为安全理事会中已经批准日内瓦议定书的所有理事国，都再一次地表示承当日内瓦议定书所规定的义务。因此，在这个问题上，美国在道义上和政治上都陷于孤立，遭受了失败。
    美国政府又千方百计地阻止国际红十字大会通过关于批准日内瓦议定书的决议。这种企图也失败了。
    在这种情况下，美国代表被迫在联合国裁减军备委员会发表声明，再一次企图为美国拒绝批准日内瓦议定书的行为掩饰和辩解。事实上，他这种声明就等于美国在联合国委员会会议上正式拒绝批准日内瓦议定书，公开宣布美国使用细菌武器和进行细菌战的侵略意图；而且人们也正是这样想的。
    毫无疑问，在全世界上不会有任何一个诚实的人支持那些正在准备使用可耻的和卑鄙的细菌武器、正在准备发动罪恶的细菌战的人们的态度。联合国裁减军备委员会也不能够漠视这个重要的国际问题。裁减军备委员会的直接责任是研究禁止细菌武器的问题，并尽它的力量采取一切措施保证四十二个国家批准的日内瓦议定书所规定的公认的禁止细菌武器的国际法准则能够得以严格和确切的履行和遵守。这是裁减军备委员会的一个最重要的任务和直接的责任。苏联代表团本着这种高尚的人道主义的原则，为了努力争取和平的巩固和国际安全，建议委员会讨论苏联提出的建议：禁止使用细菌武器，防止破坏细菌战禁令，并惩罚这一禁令的违反者。
