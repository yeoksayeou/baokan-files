Overcoming the Non-Proletarian Ideology of Leading Cadres is Key to Promoting Advanced Experience
Gao Shijin, Deputy Director of the Northeast Textile Industry Bureau

In the past two years, our Northeast state-owned textile industry has made certain achievements in promoting advanced experience. However, in some factories, there are still the following undesirable phenomena: First, inadequate efforts to promote existing mature advanced experience; second, turning a blind eye to or insufficiently valuing immature, piecemeal advanced experience among workers; and third, unwillingness to promote "other people's" advanced experience, always wanting to create their own system. The reason for these situations is mainly that our leaders at all levels have insufficient understanding of the importance of promoting advanced experience. They do not understand that promoting advanced experience is a basic method for improving productivity, increasing the strength to resist America and aid Korea, accelerating China's industrialization, and improving the living standards of the working people. There are still more or less remnants of non-proletarian ideology at work in their minds. This is mainly manifested in the following aspects:

(1) Satisfaction with one's own general leadership methods and existing achievements. Some leading cadres believe that it is very good that the production plan has been completed or exceeded. They are busy all day with "urgent" daily work, turning a blind eye to constantly occurring new things; and they do not have enough determination to persist in promoting already mature advanced experience. Even if they start to promote a certain advanced experience, it is often just a general call, tightening at first and then loosening, stopping when encountering difficulties.

(2) Failure to value the creativity of the masses, and lack of concern for the working conditions and lives of the masses. When they discover some creativity in their work, they also think that "there is nothing remarkable" and that it is not worth "making a fuss about." They treat it indifferently and do not take it seriously. They neither study, summarize, nor encourage or cultivate the creativity of workers. As a result, the creative enthusiasm of workers is suppressed and cannot be brought into play. In addition, the lack of concern of many leading cadres for the working conditions and lives of workers also hinders the promotion of advanced experience. When promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method last year, some factories did not focus on strengthening the maintenance of flat cars and effectively regulating the temperature and humidity of the workshop, so that the machine operation was stable and smooth. As a result, the yarn breakage rate of these factories was as high as 30% to 40%, and the workers were busy with piecing ends all the time, and could not take into account learning the Hao Jianxiu work method. In the fine spinning workshop of one factory, there was no light on a section of many spindles on two rows of machines against the wall. When the night came, the workers were working in the dark, which of course made it difficult to promote advanced experience. Some factories found that the sweeping pushers were not enough, the wiping boards were not easy to use, the flannel was worn out, and the small iron skewers of the winding skin rollers and the large bamboo skewers of the winding flying flowers were not available during the promotion. …Workers have suggested these problems to the leadership many times, but they have not been resolved. For example, when promoting the 1951 Weaving Work Method, the Northeast Textile Industry Bureau has clearly instructed all factories not to arbitrarily change the wage quota of weaving workers during the promotion, but individual factories still arbitrarily revised piece-rate wages when the workers' tending ability and the amount of weaving were slightly improved, which affected the workers' morale. These leadership thoughts and styles lacking mass viewpoint are a major obstacle to the promotion of advanced experience.

(3) Some leading cadres have a floating style, only love to shout slogans and do not deal with actual work. When they promote advanced experience, they ignore a series of organizational education work and research and inspection work, often making the promotion work a mere formality; even the advanced experience is vague about what it is all about. For example, when the Hao Jianxiu work method was first promoted last year, some factories adopted a comprehensive promotion method without careful education, key training, typical demonstrations, and other arduous work. Some issued "Hao Jianxiu Worker" aprons indiscriminately; others inserted red flags indiscriminately and carried out "all-red" competitions. As a result, the number of "Hao Jianxiu workers" recorded on the reports was large, but there were not many who truly learned and conscientiously implemented the Hao Jianxiu work method. Some factories one-sidedly emphasized reducing leather roller waste, believing that "reducing the leather roller waste rate is the concentrated expression of the Hao Jianxiu work method," and rewarded as long as the leather roller waste was reduced to a certain amount. As a result, although the leather roller waste was reduced on the surface, a large amount of leather roller waste was found in the wool roller waste, the sweeping cotton, the toilet, the dining room, and under the floor, causing great waste.

(4) Some leading cadres like to be unconventional, are obsessed with their own "creations," always want to do something different, make a splash, and are unwilling to effectively promote "other people's" advanced experience. After the 1951 Weaving Work Method was summarized, the Northeast Textile Industry Bureau was preparing to promote it, but the leading comrades of individual cotton mills believed that the 1951 Weaving Work Method was not necessarily suitable for the situation of the factory, saying that mechanically copying the 1951 Weaving Work Method could not make the factory workers feel cordial and easy to understand. They insisted on promoting the work method of the workers in their own factory (this worker was one of the creators of the 1951 Weaving Work Method who participated in the National Weaving Conference). They continued to bury their heads in summarizing the doffing work method of a certain group in the fine spinning workshop of the factory. This work method was produced under the ideological guidance of simply emphasizing non-breaking ends of doffing in order to reduce the leather roller waste. According to the performance test results, although there were few ends broken, it took 70 to 100 seconds to doff a set of yarn. This fundamentally violated the purpose of the fine spinning workshop to try its best to reduce the doffing time and improve the machine operation efficiency. After these shortcomings and errors were pointed out, the leaders of the factory still did not take it seriously. Of course, this kind of thinking of doing something different is not unique to this factory.

It can be seen from the above situation that earnestly overcoming the non-proletarian ideology of cadres at all levels and resolutely eliminating the influence of bourgeois enterprise management methods on us is an important key to doing a good job in promoting advanced experience.

### 克服领导干部的非无产阶级思想是推广先进经验的关键

    克服领导干部的非无产阶级思想是推广先进经验的关键
    东北纺织工业管理局副局长  高士瑾
    两年来，我们东北国营纺织工业，在推广先进经验方面获得了一定的成绩。但在有些工厂里，却还有以下几种不好的现象：一、对已有的成熟的先进经验推广不力；二、对工人中未成熟的点滴先进经验熟视无睹或不够重视；三、不愿推广“人家的”先进经验，总想自己另搞一套。所以产生这些情况，主要是由于我们各级领导干部对推广先进经验的重要意义认识不足，不懂得推广先进经验是提高生产力增加抗美援朝力量加速中国工业化和改善劳动人民生活的基本方法，他们头脑中还有或多或少的非无产阶级思想残余在作祟。这主要表现在以下几方面：
    （一）满足于自己一般化的领导方法和已有的成绩。有些领导干部认为生产计划已经完成或超过了，就很不错。他们整天忙于眼前“紧迫”的日常工作，对于不断发生的新鲜事物，熟视无睹；对于已经成熟的先进经验，又无足够决心坚持推广。即使着手推广某项先进经验，也往往是一般号召，前紧后松，遇难而止。
    （二）不重视群众的创造，不关心群众的劳动条件和生活。发现了工作中有某些创造，也认为“没有什么了不起”，值不得“大惊小怪”，漠然视之，不以为意。既不研究、总结，也不鼓励、培养工人的创造。结果，工人的创造热情被压制不能发挥。此外，很多领导干部对工人劳动条件和生活不关心，也妨碍先进经验的推广。去年开始推广郝建秀工作法时，有些厂没有着重加强平车检修工作，并有效地调节车间温湿度，使机台运转平稳、圆滑，因之，这些厂的细纱断头率高达百分之三十到四十，看台工一味忙于接头，也顾不上学习郝建秀工作法。有一个厂的细纱车间，靠墙的两列机台上很多车头有一段毫无灯光，一到夜晚工友都在摸着黑干活，这当然难以推广先进经验。有的厂在推广中发现扫地推子不够用，擦板不好使，呢子磨光了，卷皮辊的小铁签子和卷飞花的大竹签子都没有……这些问题工人向领导方面提议数次，也一直不能解决。又如在推广一九五一织布工作法时，东北纺织工业管理局已经明文指示各厂在推广中不得擅自改变织布工人的工资定额，但仍有个别厂在工人看台能力和织布数量稍有提高时，就擅自改订计件工资，影响工人情绪。这些缺乏群众观点的领导思想和作风，是推广先进经验的一个很大的障碍。
    （三）有些领导干部作风飘浮，只爱空喊不务实际。他们推广先进经验时，忽视一系列的组织教育工作和研究检查工作，往往使推广工作流于形式；甚至连先进经验到底是怎么一回事也模糊了。例如去年开始推广郝建秀工作法时，有些厂不经过耐心教育、重点培养、典型示范等艰苦工作，就采取全面铺开的推广办法。有的滥发“郝建秀工作者”围裙；有的乱插红旗，进行“满堂红”竞赛。结果，表报上面记载的“郝建秀工作者”数目很多，但真正学会和认真执行郝建秀工作法的并不多见。有的厂一味强调减少皮辊花，认为“降低皮辊花率是郝建秀工作法的集中表现”，只要皮辊花减到一定数量即行奖励。结果虽然表面上皮辊花减少了，但是羢辊花里、扫地棉里、厕所、饭厅、以及地板下面都发现了大量皮辊花，造成了极大的浪费。
    （四）有些领导干部喜欢标新立异，醉心于自己的“创造”，总想另搞一套，一鸣惊人，不愿切实推广“人家的”先进经验。一九五一织布工作法总结出来以后，东北纺织工业管理局就准备推广，但个别棉纺厂的领导同志则认为一九五一织布工作法并不一定适合本厂情况，说什么硬搬一九五一织布工作法不能使该厂工人感到亲切易懂，坚持要推广他们自己厂里工人的工作法（这个工人是参加全国织布会议的一九五一织布工作法的创造者之一）。并继续埋头总结该厂细纱车间某小组的落纱工作法，这一工作法是在单纯为了减少皮辊花强调落纱不断头的思想指导下所产生的。经表演试验结果，断头虽然很少，但是落一次纱竟需七十秒至一百多秒的时间。这就根本违反了细纱车间必须尽力减少落纱时间提高机台运转效率的目的。这些缺点和错误，经指出后，该厂领导同志还不以为然。像这种另搞一套的风头思想，当然并不是这一个厂所独有的。
    从上述情况可以看出，切实克服各级干部的非无产阶级思想，坚决清除资产阶级管理企业方法对我们的影响，乃是做好推广先进经验工作的重要关键。
