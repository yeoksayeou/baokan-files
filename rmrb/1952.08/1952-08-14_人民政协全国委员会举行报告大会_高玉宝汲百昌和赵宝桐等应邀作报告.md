Guo MoRuo spoke after each person finished their report. He pointed out that the heroic model figures of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have a high degree of patriotism and love for the people, and therefore can clearly distinguish between love and hate, and between the enemy and ourselves; they have a high degree of self-sacrifice, and therefore can be indomitable and courageous in advancing; they have a firm proletarian stance, and therefore can implement the revolutionary collectivist ideology; they have a high degree of responsibility and discipline, and therefore can love their work and do their work well; they have a strong spirit of learning, and therefore can continuously improve their political, cultural and professional level; they can master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and therefore can continuously progress and continuously make contributions to the people. Guo MoRuo called on everyone to learn from the heroic models in order to welcome the national large-scale upsurge of economic construction, and to build our motherland into a strong fortress of peace like the Soviet Union!
