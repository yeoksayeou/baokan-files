    Patriotic Health Campaign in Yangjiata Village, Lishi, Shanxi Ensures a Bumper Harvest This Year

    Editor: The patriotic health campaign in Yangjiata Village, Ninth District, Lishi County, Shanxi Province, has become a regular movement. This is a remote mountain village, and in the past, most villagers did not pay attention to hygiene, believing that "if it's not dirty, you won't get sick," so many people were often ill. This spring, the village launched a patriotic health campaign. The village branch and village cadres conducted in-depth health education for the masses through reading newspapers. Through democratic discussion and election, a health group was established to specifically lead the patriotic health work. A plan of "four cleans and five eliminations" was formulated. All households in the village sweep the inside of their cave dwellings and courtyards once a day, and the streets are swept every three days; individuals wash their hands and faces every day, wash their clothes every ten days, often air their bedding, and food must be clean, etc. In order to implement this plan, in addition to strengthening health education for the villagers, the health group conducts inspections street by street and household by household every five days, and monthly evaluations and rewards are given. Therefore, everyone in the village is clean, and every household is clean. Yang Jiyin cleaned up the 30-year accumulation of dirt outside his gate and sent it to the fields as fertilizer; Luo Pengzu repaired the latrine pit that was detrimental to public health. The whole village cleared eleven unnecessary manure piles, and the toilets of each household were tidied up, and the eating utensils were covered with wiping cloths. Therefore, this summer, the number of flies in the village has been reduced by two-thirds compared with previous years, and men, women, old and young are very healthy, and no one has been ill. Because men, women, old and young have gained health, this year's crops were cultivated earlier and better. In previous years, the crops were only hoed twice by the beginning of autumn, but this year, the third hoeing has also been completed. Although it is dry, the seedlings are growing very luxuriantly. The masses said: "A bumper harvest is expected this year!"

    山西离石杨家塌村爱国卫生运动保证了今年丰收
    编辑同志：山西省离石县九区杨家塌村爱国卫生运动已形成一个经常性的运动。这里是个偏僻的山村，以往一般村民都不重视卫生，认为“不干不净，吃了没病”，所以有很多人经常闹病。今春该村开展了爱国卫生运动，村支部及村干部通过读报，对群众进行了深入的卫生教育，通过民主讨论选举，建立了卫生小组，专门领导爱国卫生工作。并订出“四净五灭”的计划，全村各户每天打扫窑内、院子一次，三天扫街道一次；个人每天洗手脸，十天洗一次衣服，经常晾晒被褥，食物要干净等。为了贯彻这个计划，除对村民加强卫生教育外，卫生小组每五天逐街逐户检查一次，每月进行评比奖励。因此全村人人清洁，家家清洁。杨继银把大门外积存三十年的脏土都打扫了，送上地作了肥料；雒彭祖修理了有碍公共卫生的便坑。全村共清除了十一个不必要的粪堆，各家的茅厕都经过了整理，饮食用具都用拭布遮盖。所以，今年夏天村里的苍蝇比往年减少了三分之二，男女老少都很健康，没有一人害过病。由于男女老少获得了健康，今年的庄稼耕作得又早又好。往年到立秋庄稼才锄二遍，今年三锄也结束了。虽说天旱，但苗子都长的很茂盛，群众说：“今年丰收有望！”
