Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, August 21st: The battles on the Korean front remained quite frequent and intense in July. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' ground forces engaged in 238 battles with the enemy troops this month, and conducted small-scale counter-attacks in certain areas. Our forces annihilated a total of 19,502 enemy soldiers throughout the month, including 9,420 American and British invading troops.

	The battles for the control of certain hilltops on the front lines were the fiercest in July. During these hilltop battles, under the guidance of the Korean-Chinese People's forces' operational principle of annihilating enemy manpower and accumulating small victories into large ones, we achieved victories with mass casualties inflicted on the enemy through meticulous organization and preparation, excellent command skills, and a brave and resolute fighting style. For example, in the battle for the nameless heights west of Tieyuan and east of Shangpu-ri, the US 2nd Infantry Division was annihilated by our forces with a loss of over one thousand troops as soon as they entered the position. There were many such battles in other areas of the front. Late at night on July 8th, the enemy, with a battalion-sized force, attacked a position held by our troops southeast of Gimcheon. Our small number of defenders fought fiercely with the enemy for more than an hour, inflicting heavy casualties on them, and then proactively retreated into tunnel fortifications to continue fighting. The following evening, under the cover of intense artillery fire, our forces, in coordination with the brave fighters inside the tunnels, launched a victorious counter-attack, wiping out most of the invading enemy forces. Afterwards, although the enemy launched fourteen consecutive counter-attacks, they were all repelled by our forces. In this battle, our forces killed or wounded more than 1,100 enemy soldiers. On the evening of July 10th, a unit of our forces on the eastern front launched a counter-attack against a hilltop position held by the enemy south of Goseong, wiping out an entire company of Rhee Syngman's puppet troops guarding the position. Subsequently, the enemy launched thirteen counter-attacks, all of which were resolutely repelled by our forces occupying the hilltop position. On the afternoon of the 12th, enemy warships, artillery and ground artillery furiously bombarded the hilltop, and then, under the cover of artillery fire, a battalion-sized force charged towards the hilltop. However, even with such concentrated firepower, the enemy could not get their infantry to the top of the hill; their continuous twenty-plus charges were all bravely repelled by our forces. It was not until the 14th that our forces proactively withdrew from this area and returned to our own positions. In these two days and three nights of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered over 1,300 casualties.

	Our artillery units have been conducting accurate and intense bombardments of enemy positions every day, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, which has become a serious threat to the enemy's forward troops. In the month of July, our artillery fire killed or wounded more than 3,200 enemy soldiers, accounting for about one-sixth of the total number of enemy soldiers annihilated throughout the month. The increasingly widespread sniper movement launched by our infantry sharpshooters has also achieved greater and greater results. In July, our brave snipers killed or wounded 3,526 enemy soldiers, which is 461 more than the 3,065 in June, and more than 1.6 times the 1,355 in May.

	The results of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in July are as follows
	(Incomplete Statistics):
	I. A total of 19,502 enemy soldiers were annihilated, including 8,962 American soldiers, 458 British soldiers, 33 Canadian soldiers, and 10,049 Rhee puppet soldiers.
	II. Main Captures: One rocket launcher, one recoilless gun, two flamethrowers, one rocket launcher, 96 light and heavy machine guns, 623 various guns, five radio stations, and 49 various communication devices.
	III. Our ground artillery and air force shot down 120 enemy aircraft, damaged 149 enemy aircraft, for a total of 269 enemy aircraft shot down or damaged. 61 enemy tanks were destroyed, and 38 enemy tanks were damaged. 28 enemy artillery pieces were destroyed. 57 enemy vehicles were destroyed and 30 enemy vehicles were damaged.

    朝中部队七月份歼敌一万九千余
    击落击伤敌机二百多架毁伤敌战车近百辆
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】七月份朝鲜前线的战事仍然相当频繁而激烈。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的地面部队在这个月中共与敌军作战二百三十八次，并在某些地方进行了小规模的反击战。我军全月共歼灭敌军一万九千五百零二名，其中有美英侵略军九千四百二十名。
    七月份前线某几个山头的争夺战是最激烈的战斗。在这些山头争夺战中，朝中人民军队在歼灭敌军有生力量，积小胜为大胜的作战方针的指导下，以精密的组织准备，优良的指挥艺术和勇猛坚决的战斗作风，取得了大量杀伤敌人的胜利。例如在铁原以西上浦防以东无名高地的争夺战中，美国侵略军第二师刚进入阵地就被我军歼灭了一千数百名。在前线其他地区也有不少这样的战斗。七月八日深夜，敌军以一个营的兵力进犯金城东南我军某处阵地。我少数守军与敌激战一个多小时，取得大量杀伤敌人的战果以后，主动转入坑道工事继续战斗。次日傍晚，我军在猛烈炮火的掩护下，和坑道内的勇士们配合举行胜利的反击，将进犯敌军大部歼灭。以后，虽然敌军连续地进行了十四次反扑，但都被我军击退。在这次战斗中，我军共毙伤敌军一千一百多名。七月十日晚，东线我军某部向高城以南一个敌军的山头阵地发起反击，将守敌李承晚伪军的一个连全部歼灭。接着敌军进行了十三次反扑，都被占据山头阵地的我军坚决击退。十二日下午，敌军的军舰大炮和地面炮火向这个山头疯狂轰击，接着以一个营兵力在炮火掩护下向这个山头猛扑。但是敌军使用这样集中的火力也不能把他们的步兵送上山顶；他们连续进行的二十多次冲锋都被我军英勇击退。直到十四日，我军才主动撤出这个地方回到自己的阵地上。在这两天三夜的激烈战斗中，敌军伤亡达一千三百多名。
    我军炮兵部队每天都向敌军阵地进行准确而猛烈的轰击，杀伤了很多敌军，这已成为敌军前沿部队的严重威胁。在七月份的一个月中，我军炮火杀伤敌军三千二百多名，约占全月歼敌总数的六分之一。我军步兵射击手们所开展的日益广泛的狙击运动，也取得了越来越大的战果。七月份中，被我英勇的狙击手们所毙伤的敌军达三千五百二十六名，比六月份的三千零六十五名多四百六十一名，比五月份的一千三百五十五名多一点六倍以上。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军七月份的战果如下
    （不完全统计）：
    一、共歼灭敌军一万九千五百零二名，其中包括美军八千九百六十二名，英军四百五十八名，加拿大军三十三名，李伪军一万零四十九名。
    二、主要缴获：火箭炮一门，无座力炮一门，火焰喷射器两具，火箭筒一个，轻重机枪九十六挺，各种枪六百二十三枝，电台五部，各种通话机四十九部。
    三、我地面炮火与空军共击落敌机一百二十架，击伤敌机一百四十九架，共计击落击伤敌机二百六十九架。击毁敌军战车六十一辆，击伤敌军战车三十八辆。击毁敌军各种炮二十八门。击毁敌军汽车五十七辆、击伤敌军汽车三十辆。
