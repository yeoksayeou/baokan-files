Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 11th: The plenary session of the Korean Armistice Talks delegations of both sides resumed on the 11th, after a week-long recess at the suggestion of the other side. At the meeting, General Nam Il, the chief representative of our side, pointed out that both sides had reached agreement on the textual details of the draft armistice agreement. The only reason hindering the Korean armistice was the other side's insistence on detaining prisoners of war (POWs) and their refusal to concretely implement the POW repatriation clauses already agreed upon by both sides. General Nam Il reiterated our side's firm position to enable the POWs of both sides to return home and live peaceful lives based on the agreements reached. At the meeting on the 11th, the chief representative of the other side, Harrison, continued to adopt an attitude of refusing to negotiate and refusing to discuss, adhering to his absurd claim of detaining POWs, and once again suggested a seven-day recess until August 19th. General Nam Il sternly pointed out that for two months, the other side had disregarded the desire of the people of the world for an early armistice and had repeatedly unilaterally requested recesses. In June, the other side unilaterally announced recesses three times. In the past half month alone, there have been fourteen days of recess. The other side's renewed proposal for a seven-day recess only exposed the other side's deliberate attempt to delay the armistice talks and obstruct the Korean armistice. The other side must bear all the responsibilities arising therefrom. Facts and time will surely tell the other side that if the other side is willing to achieve an armistice on the Korean battlefield, it must abandon its claim to detain POWs and its attitude of refusing to negotiate and refusing to meet, and sit down at the negotiating table honestly and negotiate a solution to the POW issue on the reasonable basis of our plan. General Nam Il's main speech was as follows:

    "The staff officers of both sides have reached an agreement on the textual details of the draft armistice agreement, and the Korean armistice is within reach. The only question at present is whether your side is truly sincere in concretely implementing the POW repatriation clauses already agreed upon by both sides and realizing the Korean armistice. According to Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement, our side believes that both sides must repatriate all foreign POWs held by them, namely, United Nations forces POWs and Chinese People's Volunteers POWs. As for Korean POWs held by both sides, that is, South Korean army and Korean People's Army POWs, those whose families are in the area held by the detaining side may be allowed to return home locally without being repatriated. Our side has also specifically suggested that, based on this principle, both sides re-verify the lists exchanged on December 18, 1951, to finally determine the list of POWs to be repatriated by both sides. This is the only reasonable solution for the concrete implementation of the POW repatriation clauses already agreed upon by both sides, and it is also a compromise solution that conforms to the Geneva Convention and reasonably meets the requirements of both sides. However, when the Korean armistice is within reach, your side is doing everything possible to obstruct the arrival of the armistice. Your side refuses to conduct any discussions in the meeting and repeatedly suggests long-term recesses, with fourteen days of recess in the past half month alone. Your side is attempting to implement so-called 'military pressure' outside the meeting, carrying out indiscriminate bombing of our peaceful towns and residents. Your side should have thoroughly understood that all these methods are absolutely impossible and do not contribute to the solution of the problem in the slightest. The POW issue must be resolved through consultation on a fair and reasonable basis. Our side's plan is the only reasonable solution to the POW issue."

    朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会复会
    我重申解决遣俘问题的合理方案
    哈利逊蓄意拖延谈判再次要求休会七天
    【新华社开城十一日电】朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会，在对方建议下休会一星期后，十一日复会。我方首席代表南日将军在会上指出：双方对于停战协定草案的文字细节已达成协议，阻碍着朝鲜停战的唯一原因在于对方坚持扣留战俘的主张，拒绝具体实施双方已经协议的遣俘条款。南日将军重申我方根据已达成的协议使双方战俘得以遣返回家过和平生活的坚定立场。对方首席代表哈利逊在十一日会上，仍然采取了拒绝协商和拒绝讨论的态度，坚持其扣留战俘的荒谬主张，并再次建议休会七天到八月十九日。南日将军严词指出：两个月来，对方不顾世界人民要求早日达成停战的愿望，连续片面要求休会。六月份内对方三次片面宣布休会。而最近半个月以来，更休会了十四天。对方再次提出休会七天只是暴露了对方蓄意拖延停战谈判，阻挠朝鲜停战。对方必须担负由此而产生的一切责任。事实与时间必定会告诉对方如果对方愿意在朝鲜战场上达成停战，就必须放弃扣留战俘的主张与拒绝协商，拒绝开会的态度，而老老实实地坐在会议桌上，在我方方案的合理基础上协商解决遣俘问题。南日将军主要发言如下：
    “双方参谋人员对于停战协定草案的文字细节已经取得了协议，朝鲜停战举手可及。目前唯一的问题是你方是否确有诚意具体实施双方已经协议的遣俘条款，实现朝鲜停战。根据停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款，我方认为双方必须遣返其所收容下的全部外籍战俘，即联合国军战俘与中国人民志愿军战俘。而双方收容的朝鲜籍战俘，亦即南朝鲜军及朝鲜人民军战俘中其家在收容一方地区者，则可以许其就地回家，不必遣返。我方并曾具体建议根据这一原则，双方重新校正一九五一年十二月十八日所交换的名单，以最后确定双方遣返的战俘名单。这是具体实施双方已协议的遣俘条款的唯一合理方案，这也是符合于日内瓦公约在合理程度上适合双方要求的折衷方案。但在朝鲜停战举手可及的时候，你方却千方百计地阻挠停战的到来。你方在会内拒绝进行任何讨论，一再建议长期的休会，在最近半个月内就休会了十四天。你方在会外妄图施行所谓‘军事压力’，对我方和平城镇和居民进行狂轰滥炸，你方应该已经彻底了解，所有这些办法是绝对行不通的，丝毫无助于问题的解决的。遣俘问题必须在公平合理的基础上经由协商求得解决。我方方案是解决遣俘问题唯一合理的方案。”
