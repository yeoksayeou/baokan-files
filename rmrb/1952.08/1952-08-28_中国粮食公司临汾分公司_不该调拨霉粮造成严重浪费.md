    China Grain Company Linfen Branch
    Should Not Have Transferred Moldy Grain, Causing Serious Waste
    Editor: On August 13th, the Linfen Branch of the China Grain Company transferred ten truckloads of millet to the Liulihe Grain Company in Hebei Province. Upon inspection at the destination, it was discovered that the millet had a foul odor. After checking with a thermometer, the grain temperature was above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The millet had turned blackish-green and formed into clumps, rendering it inedible. In one inspected truck (60,000 catties), 1,677 catties were inedible. The complete loss figures for the remaining nine trucks have not yet been tallied. This grain cannot be sold. According to the escorting comrade, "The grain was already moldy when it was dispatched from Yuci. After loading, it rained for several days en route." However, rain en route would only cause the grain near the surface of the bags to mold. The fact that the millet inside the bags had formed into clumps weighing six or seven catties indicates that it had been moldy for a long time. The Linfen Grain Branch's transfer of a large quantity of spoiled millet has caused a significant waste of national manpower and resources, for which it should bear full responsibility. I suggest that the Linfen Grain Branch inspect its storage and transportation work, investigate the cause of this transfer of bad millet, propose solutions, and provide suggestions for future improvements to ensure the effective management of grain storage and transportation.

### 中国粮食公司临汾分公司  不该调拨霉粮造成严重浪费

    中国粮食公司临汾分公司
    不该调拨霉粮造成严重浪费
    编辑同志：中国粮食公司临汾分公司在八月十三日调往河北省琉璃河粮食公司十车小米。到站检查时，发觉小米有臭味，经用测温器检查，这些粮食热度在华氏五十度以上，小米已变为黑绿色，结成米块，不能食用。在已查明的一车（六万斤）粮食中，不能食用的就有一千六百七十七斤，其余九车还没有统计出完整的损失数字。这些粮食都不能出售。据押运同志谈：“在榆次发车时，粮食就已霉坏了，装车以后，在中途又遇了几天雨”。但中途遇雨，只能使靠包皮的粮食霉坏了，这些米包中间结成六、七斤重的米块，显然是早已霉坏了的。临汾粮食分公司这次调运大量坏米，给国家造成大量人力物力的浪费，应负完全责任。我建议临汾粮食分公司检查储运工作，查明这次调运坏米的原因，提出处理办法和今后改进的意见，切实做好粮食储运工作。　　　　　　　　李金声
