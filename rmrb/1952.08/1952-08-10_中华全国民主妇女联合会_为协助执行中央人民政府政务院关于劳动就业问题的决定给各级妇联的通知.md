The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated a decision on labor employment issues on August 4th. This decision not only stipulates solutions to the employment problems of various unemployed individuals, but also points out the path for intellectual women who were discriminated against and unable to find jobs in the old society, as well as the vast number of women engaged in household labor. This provides more favorable conditions and new strength for implementing the policy of equality between men and women and serving women. Women's federations at all levels should resolutely assist the government in realizing this decision by actively carrying out the following specific tasks.

First, widely publicize the spirit and content of the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on labor employment issues to the masses. In cities, grassroots women's representative meetings should be convened to convey and discuss this decision in order to strengthen the masses' confidence in employment prospects, enhance their enthusiasm for learning in preparation for employment, overcome possible symptoms of impatience for employment among the masses, and prevent departmentalism in the leadership of women's federations. At the same time, in publicizing labor employment, we must do our utmost to prevent the mood of belittling household labor, and consciously explain the significance of household labor, so that family women who cannot and do not need to be employed for the time being can be content with household labor. When transferring women to employment, priority should be given to solving the occupational problems of unemployed women, followed by women seeking employment; priority should be given to solving the occupational problems of women with financial difficulties and skills, followed by women who are not very financially difficult or have no special skills. This principle should be combined with a unified plan for employment allocation and carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. According to the current situation, it may be necessary to use family handicraft industry and handicraft mutual aid and cooperation to solve the employment problems of a large number of family women for a considerable period of time. In this regard, women's federations should not only vigorously promote it, but also become a powerful assistant to the cooperative headquarters in organizing the vast number of family women to participate in family handicraft production. To this end, cadres of women's federations should conscientiously study and research the decision of the Government Administration Council on labor employment issues in order to implement it.

Second, women's federations in all cities should systematically investigate the situation of women's unemployment or job seeking: such as the number of people, their ideological situation, education level, whether they have special skills, the degree of urgency in seeking work, and what difficulties they have in employment, etc. At the same time, they should closely contact relevant departments such as production, trade, education, health, and cooperation to understand in detail the development and construction situation and the need for personnel, so as to have a clear understanding of the situation and cooperate with relevant departments to solve the labor employment problems of women step by step.

Third, in order to solve the unemployment and job-seeking problems of many women, it is necessary to mobilize and organize women to actively transform their thinking and learn knowledge and skills. Due to the discrimination against family women in the old society, they generally lack culture and skills. Even among them, a large number of intellectual women have wasted or reduced their original culture and technology due to long-term unemployment. There must be two basic conditions for employment: one is a correct concept of serving the people, and the other is business knowledge or skills, so as to avoid the lack of appropriate personnel to supply when the country needs staff. The large-scale construction of our country is about to begin, and the door to women's employment will become increasingly wider. Therefore, women's federations at all levels, especially urban women's federations, should foreseeably mobilize and organize women to improve their thinking and cultivate cultural knowledge and technical skills as a regular task and as a central link in solving women's labor employment problems.

Fourth, with the continuous increase in the number of employed people, childcare work will become increasingly urgent. Women's federations in various places should expand and develop children's care undertakings, and use the strength of mass organizations to develop mass mutual aid and self-run nurseries to adapt to the new situation.

Women's federations in various places, especially in large and medium-sized cities, should report to us at any time the experience and problems found in the process of carrying out the above work.

    中华全国民主妇女联合会
    为协助执行中央人民政府政务院关于劳动就业问题的决定给各级妇联的通知
    中央人民政府政务院于八月四日颁布了关于劳动就业问题的决定。这个决定不仅对各种失业人员的就业问题规定了解决的办法，而且给在旧社会被人歧视找不到职业的知识妇女以及广大家庭劳动妇女指出了道路。这对于贯彻男女平等政策及我们为妇女服务增加了便利的条件和新的力量。各级妇联应坚决为协助政府实现这一决定而积极地进行如下具体工作。
    第一，根据中央人民政府政务院关于劳动就业问题的决定的精神和内容，广泛地向群众进行宣传。在城市要普遍召开基层妇女代表会议，传达、讨论这一决定，以加强群众对就业前途的信心，提高群众准备就业能力的学习情绪，克服群众中可能产生的就业急性病，防止妇联领导上的本位主义；同时在宣传劳动就业中要极力防止轻视家庭劳动的情绪，要有意识地说明家庭劳动的意义，使不能和暂时不必就业的家庭妇女安于家庭劳动。在输送妇女就业时，应先解决失业妇女的职业问题，后解决求业妇女的职业问题；先解决生活困难和有技能的妇女的职业问题，后解决生活不很困难或并无专长的妇女的职业问题。这一原则应结合统一调配就业的计划，有计划有步骤地进行。按照目前情况，有可能在一个相当时期内，还要采用家庭手工业和手工业互助合作方式来解决大批家庭妇女劳动就业问题。在这方面，妇联不但要极力宣传，而且要成为合作总社组织广大家庭妇女参加家庭手工业生产的有力助手。为此，妇联干部对政务院关于劳动就业问题的决定，应认真学习研究，以求贯彻执行。第二，各城市妇联应有计划地调查妇女失业或求职情况：如人数多少、思想情况、文化程度、有无专长、要求工作迫切的程度、以及就业有何困难等等，同时要密切和生产、贸易、教育、卫生、合作等有关部门联系，详尽地了解发展建设的情况和需要人员的情况，做到心中有数，以便配合有关部门按步就班地解决妇女的劳动就业问题。
    第三，为了解决许多妇女的失业求业问题，必须动员和组织妇女积极改造思想和学习知识技能。家庭妇女由于过去受旧社会的歧视，一般缺乏文化和技能，即使其中有大批的知识妇女，也由于长期不就业而荒废或降低了原有的文化和技术。在就业上必须具备两个基本条件，一是有为人民服务的正确观念，另一是有业务知识或技能，以免在国家需要工作人员的时候却没有适当人员来供给。我国大规模的建设即将开始，妇女就业之门将日臻广阔，因此各级妇联特别是城市妇联，应有预见地将动员和组织妇女群众、提高思想、培养文化知识和技术能力，作为经常工作，并作为解决妇女劳动就业问题的中心一环。
    第四，随着就业人数的不断增加，儿童托管工作也将日益迫切，各地妇联应扩大和发展儿童保育事业，运用群众组织力量发展群众互助自办的托儿站，以适应新的情况。
    各地妇联特别是各大、中城市妇联在进行上项工作过程中的经验和发现的问题，希随时报告我们。
