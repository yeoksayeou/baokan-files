Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 8th. Disregarding the serious protest of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government on July 12th, and disregarding the resolute opposition and serious warnings of the people of the whole country, the US invading air force in Korea, following the serious provocative incident on July 11th of strafing and killing and wounding Chinese people, again intruded into China's Northeast airspace at 00:28 on August 7th, and bombed the Liangmindianzi area, seriously injuring two residents. At 17:15 on the same day, four US aircraft again intruded into the Dadonggou area and indiscriminately strafed. In total, from July 30th to August 7th, the US invading air force in Korea intruded into China's airspace a total of 79 sorties, 398 aircraft times, details as follows:

    On July 30th, one batch of US aircraft, totaling two sorties, intruded near Andong, China.

    On August 1st, seventeen batches of US aircraft, totaling eighty-four sorties, intruded into areas including Dadonggou, Andong, Changdianhekou and 15 kilometers west of it, 20 kilometers southeast of Kuandian, 24 kilometers south of Huanren, Lagushao, Ji'an, Tonghua and 35 kilometers northwest of it.

    On August 2nd, eleven batches of US aircraft, totaling eighty sorties, intruded into areas including Dadonggou, Langtou, Andong, Guanshui, Lagushao, 10 kilometers south of Kuandian, and 10 kilometers north of Yongdianhekou.

    On August 3rd, nine batches of US aircraft, totaling forty-two sorties, intruded into areas including Andong, Langtou, Jiguan Mountain northwest of Fengcheng, Stone City northeast of Fengcheng and 30 kilometers north of it, Changdianhekou, Lagushao, northeast of Kuandian, 28 kilometers south of Tumen, and 8 kilometers southwest of Huichun.

    On August 4th, nine batches of US aircraft, totaling fifty-six sorties, intruded into areas including Langtou, Andong and 25 kilometers northwest of it, Changdianhekou, 15 kilometers southeast of Kuandian, 35 kilometers east of Yongdianhekou, and Ji'an.

    On August 6th, seventeen batches of US aircraft, totaling eighty sorties, intruded into areas including Andong, Dadonggou, Stone City northeast of Fengcheng, Jiguan Mountain northwest of Fengcheng, Changdianhekou, Lagushao, Ji'an and Huangbaidianzi northeast of it.

    On August 7th, nine batches of US aircraft, totaling thirty-three sorties, intruded into areas including Fuyoujie, Shizhuzi, Ji'an, Changdianhekou, Weisha River, Langtou, Andong, Jiuliancheng, Yongdianhekou, Gulouzi, Jiguan Mountain, Laogugou, Liangmindianzi, and Dadonggou. Among them, one aircraft dropped twenty-one bombs over Liangmindianzi at 00:28, seriously injuring two of our residents. Another four aircraft strafed Dadonggou at 17:15.

On the one hand, the American aggressors refuse to negotiate at the armistice talks, attempting to eliminate the negotiations through long-term adjournment. On the other hand, disregarding the serious protests and warnings of the Chinese government and people, they continue to intensify direct provocations against China, intruding into China's airspace, indiscriminately bombing and strafing, and seriously injuring Chinese residents. These insane crimes of the US government clearly prove that they are deliberately creating a more serious situation in the Far East in order to expand the war. The American imperialists may still be妄想 [wan xiang, have delusions] that they will be able to escape the serious responsibility for the consequences of their crimes. However, their妄想 [wan xiang, delusions] will inevitably be proven futile.

    不顾我国政府与人民的严重抗议和警告
    美机竟又侵入我东北挑衅
    滥施轰炸和扫射并重伤我国居民二人
    【新华社沈阳八日电】美国侵朝空军不顾我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长七月十二日的严重抗议，不顾我全国人民的坚决反对和严重警告，竟继其七月十一日扫射并杀伤我国人民的重大挑衅事件之后，复于八月七日零时二十八分侵入我国东北领空，并投弹轰炸我良民甸子地区，致重伤居民二人。同日十七时十五分，美机四架又侵入我大东沟地区滥行扫射。总计自七月三十日至八月七日共八天中，美国侵朝空军共七十九批，三百九十八架次侵犯我国领空，详情如下：
    七月三十日美机一批共二架次侵入我国安东附近。
    八月一日美机十七批共八十四架次侵入我大东沟、安东、长甸河口及其以西十五公里、宽甸东南二十公里、桓仁南二十四公里、拉古哨、辑安、通化及其西北三十五公里等地区。
    八月二日美机十一批共八十架次侵入我大东沟、浪头、安东、灌水、拉古哨、宽甸以南十公里、永甸河口以北十公里等地区。
    八月三日美机九批共四十二架次侵入我安东、浪头、凤城西北之鸡冠山、凤城东北之石头城及其以北三十公里、长甸河口、拉古哨、宽甸东北、图们南二十八公里、晖春西南八公里等地区。
    八月四日美机九批共五十六架次，侵入我浪头、安东及其西北二十五公里、长甸河口、宽甸东南十五公里、永甸河口东三十五公里、辑安等地区。
    八月五日美机六批共二十一架次侵入我清源、新宾、安东及其以西二十公里、大东沟、通化、辑安、临江西北二十公里等地区。
    八月六日美机十七批共八十架次侵入我安东、大东沟、凤城东北之石头城、凤城西北之鸡冠山、长甸河口、拉古哨、辑安及其东北之黄柏甸子。
    八月七日美机九批，共三十三架次侵入我富有街、石柱子、辑安、长甸河口、苇沙河、浪头、安东、九连城、永甸河口、古楼子、鸡冠山、老古沟、良民甸子、大东沟等地区。其中一架于零时二十八分在良民甸子上空投弹二十一枚，重伤我居民二人。另四架于十七时十五分在大东沟进行扫射。
    美国侵略者一方面在停战谈判上拒绝协商，企图以长期休会来使谈判趋于消灭，另一方面又不顾我国政府与人民的严重抗议和警告，继续加紧对我国直接挑衅，侵犯我国领空，滥施轰炸和扫射，并重伤我国居民。美国政府这种疯狂罪行，显然证明他们是在蓄意造成远东更加严重的局势以便扩大战争。美帝国主义者或者还在妄想他们将能逃脱对他们的罪行的后果所负的严重责任。但是，他们的妄想必将被证明是徒然的。
