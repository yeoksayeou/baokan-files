Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong: News of another "riot" has recently emerged from Geoje Island, where the U.S. side maintains a strict information blockade. According to a Busan dispatch from the Associated Press on the 7th, a thousand "refugees" on Geoje Island rioted because of reduced rice rations. An International News Service dispatch from Geoje Island on the 8th further revealed that the rice ration for 80,000 "refugees" on Geoje Island had been reduced from 900 tons to 370 tons in July. And "officials on this troubled island unanimously believe that this riot was instigated by the Communists." The U.S. side is currently revealing very little about the detailed circumstances of this "riot." But people still remember that the U.S. side once classified a large number of prisoners of war as so-called "South Korean civilians" or "refugees" and forced 27,000 of them to wear military uniforms, making them serve as cannon fodder for the Syngman Rhee gang. People also remember that the U.S. side cut off and reduced the rations of prisoners of war on Geoje Island in early June in an attempt to force them to submit. Obviously, behind the news of the "refugee riot" lies a sinister fact: the American aggressors are using a starvation policy to force the so-called "refugees" to serve as soldiers in the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

    美迫使巨济岛“难民”当炮灰
    【新华社开城讯】美方实行严密消息封锁的巨济岛上，最近又传出了“暴动”的消息。据美联社釜山七日电称，巨济岛上有一千“难民”因为大米口粮减少而发生暴动。国际新闻社巨济岛八日电进一步透露，巨济岛上八万“难民”的大米配给，在七月间已经由九百吨减少到三百七十吨。而“这个多事之岛的官员一致认为：这次骚动是共产党挑起来的”。关于这次“暴动”的详细情形，美方现在透露得很少。但是人们都还记得，美方曾经把大批战俘分类成为所谓“南朝鲜平民”或“难民”，并且强迫其中的两万七千人穿上军衣，使他们充当李承晚匪帮的炮灰。人们也还记得，美方在六月初曾经断绝和削减巨济岛上战俘的口粮，企图迫使他们屈服。显然，在“难民暴动”的消息后面，隐藏着一个阴森的事实：美国侵略者正在用饥饿政策逼迫所谓“难民”充当李承晚伪军。
