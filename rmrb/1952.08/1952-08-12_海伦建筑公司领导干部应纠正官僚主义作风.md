    Leaders and Cadres of Hailun Construction Company Should Correct Bureaucratic Work Styles

    To the Editors: Leaders and cadres of the Hailun Construction Company in Heilongjiang Province still exhibit serious bureaucratic work styles and a singular focus on profit-making after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. This has caused great dissatisfaction among workers and resulted in significant losses in construction projects.

    Last year, when repairing a grain roasting machine, the construction company told workers that it would take 220 workdays, using standard materials. However, when work started, substandard materials were used, causing workers to spend an extra 90 workdays. Manager Gao Dejing said at the time, "Go ahead and do it. These materials are harder to work with, so we can add some workdays for you." But when the final accounts were settled, wages were still calculated based on the original 220 workdays. When workers questioned this, Manager Gao replied, "Take it or leave it. If you don't want it, leave it here." According to worker Bai Fengming, "This year, when repairing the city gate, the construction company gave us 19 workdays, but we worked 26 days. The wage rate for a major workday is 17 cents, totaling more than 30,000 yuan, but the most we earned was 19,000 yuan." Furthermore, because technicians did not carefully study the designs, rework was often necessary due to non-compliance with repair requirements, and workers were not paid for this rework.

    The company's leaders and cadres not only fail to care about workers' illnesses and injuries but also withhold workers' welfare and medical expenses. Since the construction company was established, workers have had to bear their own medical expenses whenever they are injured.

    In addition, the company's leaders and cadres do not go deep into the field but rely on feudal foremen to control the worksite, undermining labor organization. This spring, when repairing the classroom wall at No. 2 Elementary School, foreman Fan Peng insisted that the workers had not poured the mortar properly. The workers had to tear down the repaired wall to show him, and he accused them of sabotage and threatened to strike. Later, a joint inspection by the administration and the trade union confirmed that it met quality standards.

    The company's leaders and cadres, for the sake of mere profit, disregard the needs of national construction work. For example, the Zayin River Bridge is an important transportation structure, and the transportation section chief personally contacted the construction company, but the construction company refused to undertake the project. They also refused to undertake another project. We believe the above problems are very serious and hope that the company's leaders and cadres will conduct a deep self-criticism.

### 海伦建筑公司领导干部应纠正官僚主义作风

    海伦建筑公司领导干部应纠正官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：黑龙江省海伦建筑公司领导干部，在“三反”、“五反”运动后，仍存在着严重的官僚主义作风，和单纯盈利观点，引起工人很大不满，使修建工程也遭受很大损失。
    去年修炒粮机，建筑公司向工人讲好用二百二十个工，以标板来做，但开工时却用了次板，使工人多做了九十个工。高德镜经理当时说：“你们干吧，这样板子比较难做，可以给你们加上点工。”但到完工算账时，还是按原来二百二十个工开的工资。工人提出质问时，高经理答复说：“你们爱要不要，不要就放到这里。”另据白凤鸣工友讲：“今年修建城门，建筑公司给我们十九个工，我们做了二十六个工，大工工资是十七分，计三万多元，可是我们最多的才挣一万九千元。”又由于技术员设计时不仔细研究，往往因为不合修主要求而返工，返工时也不给工人工资。
    这个公司的领导干部，不但不关心工人的疾病伤亡，反而扣留工人的福利费和医药费。自建筑公司成立以来，工人每逢负伤以后，都要自己负担医药费。
    此外，这个公司的领导干部不深入现场，而依靠封建把头掌握工地，破坏劳动组织。今年春季，在第二完小修教室大墙时，监工员范鹏硬说工人没把浆灌好，工人们只好把修好的墙拆开来给他看，他反说工人破坏，要罢工。后来经行政、工会共同检查，才证实了合乎质量标准。
    这个公司的领导干部，为了单纯盈利，不顾国家建设工作的需要。如札音河桥梁是重要的交通建筑，交通科长亲自和建筑公司联系，可是建筑公司就没有包修这个工程。另有一工程他们也没有包修。我们认为上述问题是很严重的，希望这个公司的领导干部作深刻检讨。
