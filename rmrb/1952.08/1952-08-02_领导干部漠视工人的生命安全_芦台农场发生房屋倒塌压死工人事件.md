Leading Cadres Disregard Workers' Life Safety
House Collapse at Lutai Farm Kills Workers

    According to a letter from Dai Guoen, Chairman of the Ninghe County Federation of Trade Unions in Hebei Province: The leading cadres of the state-owned Lutai Farm do not pay attention to the safety of workers and have not promptly resolved the workers' housing problems, resulting in a serious incident in which workers' dormitories collapsed and workers were crushed to death. During heavy rain on the night of July 8, the five rooms occupied by workers of the first team, first squad of the agricultural team of the farm were flooded, with water accumulating to a depth of four inches inside. At 3:00 PM on the 9th, it rained again, and the workers could not work in the fields and were resting in the rooms. At 3:15 PM, the house suddenly collapsed, burying ten workers, three of whom died on the spot, one was seriously injured, and five were slightly injured. The main reason for this incident is that the leading cadres of this farm are indifferent to the safety of workers' lives. This house was built as a temporary dormitory for temporary workers in the summer of 1951 by the former farm manager. The construction cost for each room was only equivalent to eighty catties of corn. The roof beams were only two inches thick, and the pillars were only three inches thick. To prevent rain leakage, the roof was plastered with about five inches of mud. Therefore, the house was top-heavy and extremely dangerous. This year, the newly appointed farm manager, due to a shortage of housing because new houses had not yet been built, slightly repaired this house and let the workers live in it again. A few days before the accident, the farm manager came to inspect and found that the house was not strong enough, but he did not pay attention to it. Dai Guoen suggested that in order to seriously resolve this issue, all kinds of bureaucratic work styles should be eliminated, and the direct persons responsible for this incident should be given due punishment.

    In addition, according to a letter from the State-Owned Farm Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, our bureau received a long-distance telephone call from the state-owned Lutai Farm at 8:00 PM on July 9 reporting the incident of a house collapse crushing workers to death and injury. The next day, we sent people to investigate the actual situation, express condolences to the injured workers and the families of the deceased, and assist the farm in handling the aftermath. We believe that the leading cadres of the farm should be primarily responsible for this incident. They inspected the house before the rain but failed to resolve the problem in time. This proves that they still have a serious bureaucratic work style of disregarding worker safety. The current farm manager has voluntarily requested to be punished. In order for the farm to truly learn from this incident, our bureau has instructed the farm manager to conduct a review of this incident and conduct another in-depth examination of the bureaucratic work style in front of the masses. We are also prepared to give them appropriate punishment.

    The occurrence of this incident proves that our bureau still has a bureaucratic work style. In order to solve the housing problem for the farm's employees, we have decided to establish three work stations on the farm, but failed to promptly supervise and assist the farm in completing all the projects before the rainy season. In addition to conducting a profound self-criticism and strengthening inspection work, we will also circulate this matter to all state-owned farms, instructing the farm managers to immediately cooperate with the employees to conduct an in-depth inspection of the condition of all houses and employee dormitories on the farm, examine the ideology of relying on the working class to run the farm well and the farm's democratic management system, and immediately improve any problems found. Finally, our bureau will submit the responsibilities for this incident to the higher authorities for due punishment.

### 领导干部漠视工人的生命安全  芦台农场发生房屋倒塌压死工人事件

    领导干部漠视工人的生命安全
    芦台农场发生房屋倒塌压死工人事件
    据河北省宁河县总工会主席戴国恩来信：国营芦台农场的领导干部不重视工人的安全，没有及时解决工人的住宿问题，以致发生了工人宿舍倒塌，工人被压死的严重事件。七月八日夜间大雨，该场农业队第一中队第一小队工人居住的五间房子，被雨水侵入，室内积水深四寸。九日下午三点钟，天又下雨，工人不能到田间工作，都在屋中休息。到三时十五分，房子突然倒塌，压住工人十名，其中三名当场死亡，一名受重伤，五名受轻伤。这个农场的领导干部对工人的生命安全漠不关心，是造成这次事件的主要原因。这所房子是在一九五一年夏季由前任农场场长经手给临时工人盖的临时性宿舍。每间房子的建筑工资只合八十斤玉米，房檩只有二寸粗细，房柱只有三寸粗细，为了防止漏雨，房顶抹了约五寸厚的泥土。因此，房子头重脚轻，极其危险。今年新任场长因新房还没有盖好，房屋缺乏，把这所房子略加修理，又让工人住了进去。事故发生的前几天，场长曾来检查，当时已发现房子不够坚固，但并没有加以注意。戴国恩提出，为了严肃地解决这个问题，应该肃清各种各样的官僚主义作风，给这一事件的直接责任者以应得的处分。
    又据中央人民政府农业部国营农场管理局来信称，我局在七月九日晚八时接到国营芦台农场报告房屋倒塌压死压伤工人事件的长途电话，第二天即派人前往调查实际情况，慰问负伤职工及死者家属，并协助该场处理善后事宜。我们认为，这次事件，主要应由该场的领导干部负责。他们在下雨以前检查了这所房屋，但并未能及时解决问题。这证明他们至今还存在着漠视工人安全的严重的官僚主义作风。现该场场长已自动请求给予处分。为了使该场能切实接受这次事件的教训，我局已指示该场场长对此事件进行检讨，并在群众面前再次深入检查官僚主义的工作作风。我们还准备给予他们以适当的处分。
    这一事件的发生，证明了我局还存在着官僚主义作风。为了解决该场职工的住宿问题，我们已决定在该场建立三处工作站，但未能及时督促并协助该场在雨季前全部竣工。我们除作深刻检讨，加强检查工作外，并将此事通报各国营农场，指示各场场长立刻协同职工，深入检查全场房屋及职工宿舍状况，检查依靠工人阶级办好农场的思想和农场的民主管理制度，发现问题，立即加以改进。最后，我局将就这一事件所应负的责任，呈请上级给予应得的处分。
