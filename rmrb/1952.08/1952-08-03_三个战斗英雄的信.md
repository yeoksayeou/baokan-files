Letters from Three Combat Heroes

Editor's Note: We are publishing here three letters written by famous combat heroes of the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the eve of this year's "August 1st" Army Day. One is from Bao Renchuan, deputy commander of the "Tashan Heroic Regiment" and Tashan hero, to Dong Quanzhong, father of the people's hero Dong Cunrui who sacrificed himself to blow up a bunker. Another is from "Lone Courage Hero" Mao Guo to Luo Diekai, father of martyr Luo Shengjiao. The third is from female combat hero Guo Junqing to textile industry model worker Hao Jianxiu. These letters fully express the heroes' love for the motherland and the people, their hatred for the enemy, and their determination and confidence in defending the motherland and world peace.

Letter from "Tashan Hero" Bao Renchuan to the Father of People's Hero Dong Cunrui

Dear Uncle Dong Quanzhong: I am Bao Renchuan, deputy commander of the Fourth Field Army "Tashan Heroic Regiment" – Tashan Hero. As the "August 1st" Army Day approaches, it reminds me of our comrade-in-arms, People's Hero Dong Cunrui, because his heroic deeds and great patriotic spirit are constantly inspiring us to move forward!

Under your nurturing and the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, Comrade Dong Cunrui raised his class consciousness, joined the People's Army, and became an excellent Communist Party member. On May 26, 1948, in the Battle of Longhua in Rehe Province, he responded to the Party's call, picked up explosives, braved the enemy's intense fire, and bravely stepped forward to carry out a demolition mission. When, under the cover of his comrades' firepower, he rushed to a bridge-shaped bunker built over a ditch, he realized that there was no way to place the explosives. If placed on the ground, he feared that the explosives would not be able to destroy the bunker. At that critical moment, he did not think of his own life and safety, but how to complete the task assigned by the Party. In order to annihilate the enemy and liberate the broad masses of the people, he raised the explosive package high with one hand, using his own body as a blasting frame, and lit the fuse with the other. In a deafening explosion, the enemy's bunker was blown to smithereens, and Comrade Dong Cunrui also gloriously sacrificed himself. When his comrades-in-arms advanced along the path opened up by the hero, everyone shouted: "Learn from Comrade Dong Cunrui's great spirit of self-sacrifice!" Under his inspiration, they quickly eliminated the enemy and liberated Longhua City.

Heroes never die. Comrade Dong Cunrui not only lives forever in the hearts of the people of the whole country, but also his heroic deeds and noble spirit will always educate and encourage us, making us more active in our work and braver in battle. Today, when I recall the situation during the Tashan blocking operation, I feel even more the greatness of Comrade Dong Cunrui. In October 1948, in order to ensure that fraternal units completed the task of liberating Jinzhou, we blocked hundreds of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit reinforcements on the Tashan line. At that time, I was the deputy battalion commander and personally led the troops to guard the forefront of the position. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army launched fierce attacks from the sea, air, and land, doing everything in its power. The artillery fire turned our positions upside down, but the soldiers crawled out of the soil and continued to strike the enemy, preventing them from advancing an inch. The enemy's elite troops, boasting of being the "Zhao Zilong Division," rushed towards our positions using group charges and broke through a company's position. Seeing that the situation was very critical at the time, I thought to myself: In order to liberate the entire Northeast, we must not let the enemy advance a single step even if it costs us our lives. We must learn from the great spirit of People's Hero Dong Cunrui. I immediately personally led a commando team to counterattack the enemy. After a fierce battle, we recaptured the position and forced more than two hundred enemies to surrender to us, turning the battle from danger to safety.

Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we fought from the Northeast to Zhangjiakou, liberated Pingjin, and then marched south for thousands of miles, all the way to the southern coast of the motherland. After completely sweeping away the imperialist forces and Chiang Kai-shek's gang, we guarded the motherland's coastal defense line, protecting our beloved motherland. We are striving to strengthen national defense construction and build a modern and powerful national defense army.

Uncle Dong Quanzhong: Although Comrade Dong Cunrui gloriously sacrificed himself for the people and the motherland, tens of thousands of heroes and models have emerged behind him, advancing heroically under the glorious banner of Mao Zedong! At the same time, I hope that you will also actively respond to Chairman Mao's call on the agricultural production front, vigorously carry out drought prevention and drought resistance work, improve seeds and farming methods, produce more grain, practice strict economy, increase more wealth for the country, and enable the motherland to achieve victory simultaneously on the economic construction front and the national defense construction front!

Uncle Dong Quanzhong: With our People's Liberation Army's steel warriors guarding the motherland and world peace, please work hard and produce with peace of mind! We have the power to strike at any enemy who dares to invade our country! In order to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, I am writing this letter to extend my sincere condolences to you!
With best regards,
Bao Renchuan

Letter from "Lone Courage Hero" Mao Guo to the Father of Martyr Luo Shengjiao

Dear Uncle Luo Diekai: On the occasion of commemorating the 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, I am writing to extend my cordial greetings to you.

Your son, the immortal internationalist fighter Comrade Luo Shengjiao, heroically sacrificed himself to save a drowning Korean boy, Cui Ying. His great patriotism and internationalism have become a model for us to learn from.

At present, the aggressive camp headed by US imperialism is conspiring to undermine the Korean armistice talks and actively preparing to expand the war. The warmongers are seriously threatening peace and security in Asia and the world. In order to defend our motherland, we must quickly establish a strong, regularized, and modernized national defense army. I have responded to Chairman Mao's call and am actively studying culture, because only by improving our cultural level can we master modern military science and technology and completely crush any enemy who dares to invade us!

Uncle Luo Diekai: Although your son gloriously sacrificed himself, we are still alive, and we will definitely fight heroically on the front lines like Comrade Luo Shengjiao to protect you and the people of the whole country who are carrying out large-scale economic construction, allowing you to live a good life.

Uncle Luo Diekai: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army has been able to defeat enemies at home and abroad in the past 25 years. In the future, the People's Liberation Army will surely become a strong fortress for defending world peace. I hope you can work with peace of mind and use the practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the national defense construction of the motherland. We will also repay you by studying hard!
With best regards,
Mao Guo

Letter from Female Combat Hero Guo Junqing to Model Worker Hao Jianxiu

Dear Comrade Hao Jianxiu: I have long heard of your name and your brilliant achievements on the economic construction front. On the occasion of commemorating the 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, I am writing to pay my respects to you.

Under the Party's cultivation, you responded to Chairman Mao's wise call, promoted the spirit of patriotism, actively studied and created the Hao Jianxiu work method, promoted the movement to increase production and practice economy, and increased a large amount of wealth for the country, directly enhancing the power of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. Your contribution to the motherland is great and worthy of our learning!

Recalling the past, the old society did not treat women as human beings. They suffered all kinds of discrimination and oppression, and they would not even dream of becoming heroes or models! After liberation, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led women to stand up. Women participate in various jobs in the new China, and thousands of model figures have emerged. Like you, who created the Hao Jianxiu work method, as well as female driver Tian Guiying, female tractor driver Liang Jun, the Party's good daughter Zhao Guilan, female air force parachutist Lin Li, medical workers Ding Zhihui and Li Landing, etc., have all made brilliant contributions to the people and won unlimited glory on the economic construction and national defense construction fronts!

I used to be a poor child. My father was frozen to death in the mountains, and my family was oppressed by the landlords and had no food to eat. Since joining the People's Army, I have been educated by the Party, which has improved my class consciousness, and I have understood the revolutionary principles, and I know that in order to liberate the people of the whole country, we must overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's gang and drive out imperialism and establish a people's democratic regime. After several years of combat life, my contribution to the motherland is very small, but under the Party's cultivation, I have received high honors. In June of this year, the higher authorities transferred me to study culture, and earnestly taught us: In order to defend the motherland and consolidate the victory of the people, we must build a strong and modern national defense army. Without culture, it is impossible to be a better national defense army fighter. Therefore, I made up my mind to learn culture well. Before joining the army, I was illiterate. Although I learned some words in the gaps between battles after joining the army, it was still far from enough. Now, after more than three weeks of study, I am able to write general articles, and I can recite, write, and speak more than two thousand three hundred words. I have taken two arithmetic tests, and the results of each test are full marks. Although I have achieved these results, this is only the beginning of my studies. There are still many difficulties. My illness often occurs, and when I encounter difficult things to learn, I sometimes lack confidence. Whenever this happens, the Party teaches me not to bow my head to difficulties. At the same time, I also think of your and many other heroes and models' spirit of diligent study and creation, and I muster my courage and strengthen my confidence to continue my efforts.

Today, US imperialism continues to invade Korea, deliberately undermining the armistice talks, and conspiring to launch a new war of aggression. Recently, it has intensified its efforts, sending its air force to continuously invade our country's northeastern airspace, indiscriminately strafing and killing our people. In order to counter this arrogant and shameless provocation by US imperialism, we must continue to strengthen the practical actions of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to completely smash its aggressive conspiracy. I will work harder to study culture and be a modern national defense army fighter, defend our motherland's economic construction and the people's peaceful and happy life. At the same time, I also hope that you will work tirelessly and actively on the economic construction front, use your brains, and strive to create more new records.

Salute to the labor models fighting on the front of increasing production and practicing economy! And wish you victory and progress on the economic construction front!
Guo Junqing

    三个战斗英雄的信
    编者按：我们在这里发表中国人民解放军第四野战军著名战斗英雄在今年“八一”建军节前夕写的三封信，一封是“塔山英雄团”副团长——塔山英雄鲍仁川写给舍身炸碉堡的人民英雄董存瑞的父亲董全忠的信，一封是“独胆英雄”毛国写给罗盛教烈士的父亲罗迭开的信，第三封是女战斗英雄郭俊卿写给纺织工业劳动模范郝建秀的信。这些信充分表现了英雄们对祖国和人民的热爱和对敌人的憎恨，表现了英雄们保卫祖国和世界和平的决心和信心。
    “塔山英雄”鲍仁川给人民英雄董存瑞的父亲的信
    亲爱的董全忠伯伯：我是第四野战军“塔山英雄团”副团长——塔山英雄鲍仁川，当“八一”建军节来临的时候，使我想起了我们的战友——人民英雄董存瑞同志，因为他的英雄业绩和伟大的爱国主义精神，时时刻刻都在鼓舞着我们前进！
    董存瑞同志在你的养育下，在党和毛主席的教导下，提高了阶级觉悟，参加了人民军队，并成为一个优秀的共产党员。一九四八年五月二十六日，在热河省隆化战斗中，他响应了党的号召，抱起炸药，冒着敌人炽烈的炮火，勇敢地上前执行爆破任务。当他在战友们的火力掩护下冲到一个修建在沟上的桥形碉堡前时，发觉没法放炸药。如果放在地上，又怕炸药炸不破碉堡，在那个紧急关头，他想到的不是自己的生命和安全，而是怎样完成党所交给的任务。为了歼灭敌人解放广大人民，他一只手高高地托起了炸药包，把自己的身体当炸药架子，一只手拉开了导火索，在轰然巨响声中，敌人的碉堡被炸成粉碎，董存瑞同志也同时光荣地牺牲了。当他的战友们踏着英雄所开辟的道路前进时，人人高喊着：“学习董存瑞同志的伟大的自我牺牲精神！”在他的鼓舞下，迅速地消灭了敌人，解放了隆化城。
    英雄是永远不死的。董存瑞同志不但永远活在全国人民的心里，而且，他的英雄的业绩和崇高的伟大精神永远教育和鼓舞着我们，使我们在工作中更积极，在战斗中更勇敢。今天，我回忆起塔山阻击战时的情况，越发感到董存瑞同志的伟大。一九四八年十月，我们为了保证兄弟部队完成解放锦州的任务，在塔山一线阻击蒋匪的数十万援军。那时我是副营长，亲自带领着部队守卫在阵地最前沿。蒋匪军从海上、空中和陆上，竭尽全力猛烈攻击，炮火把我们的阵地炸得翻过来，战士们却从土里爬出来继续打击敌人，使敌人寸步不能前进。敌人夸称为“赵子龙师”的精锐部队，用集团冲锋的方法扑向我们的阵地，并把一连的阵地突破了。我看到当时的情况非常危急，心里想：为了解放全东北，拼死也不能让敌人前进一步，我们要学习人民英雄董存瑞的伟大精神。我立刻亲自带领突击队向敌人反击，经过一场激烈的拼杀，又把阵地夺了回来，还迫使两百多敌人向我们投降，使战斗转危为安。
    我们在毛主席的英明领导下，从东北打到了张家口，解放了平津，紧接着南下千里进军，一直打到了祖国的南海边，把帝国主义势力和蒋匪帮彻底扫清以后，就守卫在祖国的海防线上，保卫着可爱的祖国。为了加强国防建设，建设一支现代化的强大国防军而奋斗。
    董全忠伯伯：董存瑞同志虽然为人民为祖国而光荣地牺牲了；但是，在他的后面又涌现出来成千上万的英雄模范，在毛泽东的光辉旗帜下英勇前进！同时，希望您也在农业生产战线上，积极响应毛主席的号召，大力展开防旱、抗旱工作，改良种籽和耕作方法，多打粮食，厉行节约，为国家增加更多的财富，使祖国在经济建设战线上和国防建设战线上同时取得胜利！
    董全忠伯伯：有我们人民解放军的钢铁战士们保卫着祖国和世界和平，请您积极劳动安心生产吧！我们有力量打击任何敢于侵犯我们祖国的敌人！为了纪念“八一”建军节二十五周年，特写这封信向您致以恳切的慰问！此致敬礼  鲍仁川  七月二十日
    “独胆英雄”毛国给罗盛教烈士的父亲的信
    亲爱的罗迭开伯伯：在纪念“八一”建军节第二十五周年的时候，特写信向您致以亲切的慰问。
    您的儿子——不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教同志，为援救一个溺水的朝鲜少年崔?而壮烈牺牲，他这种伟大的爱国主义和国际主义精神，已经成为我们学习的榜样。
    目前以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营，正在阴谋破坏朝鲜停战谈判，积极准备扩大战争，战争贩子们严重地威胁着亚洲和世界的和平与安全。为了保卫我们的祖国，必须迅速建立一支强大的正规化现代化的国防军。我响应了毛主席的号召，正在积极学习文化，因为提高了文化水平，才能掌握近代化的军事科学和技术，才能彻底粉碎任何敢来侵犯我们的敌人！
    罗迭开伯伯：您的儿子虽然光荣地牺牲了，可是，还有我们活着，我们一定像罗盛教同志一样，英勇地战斗在最前线，来保卫您过好日子，保卫全国人民正在进行的大规模经济建设。
    罗迭开伯伯：在毛主席的领导下，人民解放军在过去二十五年来，能够战胜了国内外敌人，今后，人民解放军也必定能够成为保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。希望您安心生产，用增产节约的实际行动来支援中国人民志愿军和祖国的国防建设；我们也一定用学好文化来报答您！此致敬礼  毛国  七月二十日
    女战斗英雄郭俊卿给劳动模范郝建秀的信
    亲爱的郝建秀同志：我早就听说到你的名字和你在经济建设战线上的光辉成绩，在纪念“八一”建军节第二十五周年时，特写信向你致敬。
    你在党的培养下，响应了毛主席的英明号召，发扬了爱国主义精神，积极钻研，创造了郝建秀工作法，推动了增产节约运动，为国家增加了大量财富，直接增强了抗美援朝的力量。你对祖国的贡献是伟大的，值得我们向你学习！
    回忆过去旧社会不把妇女当人看待，她们受尽了歧视和压迫，连做梦也不会想到能当上英雄或模范！解放后，共产党和毛主席领导着妇女们翻了身，在新中国的各种工作岗位上，都有广大妇女参加，并且涌现成千上万的模范人物。像创造了郝建秀工作法的你，还有女司机田桂英，女拖拉机手梁军，党的好女儿赵桂兰，女空军跳伞员林莉，医务工作者丁志辉和李蓝丁等，都在经济建设和国防建设战线上为人民创造了光辉的功绩，获得了无限光荣！
    我过去也是一个穷孩子，父亲被冻死在山上，家里受地主的压迫，没有饭吃。自从参加了人民军队以后，受到党的教育，使我提高了阶级觉悟，懂得了革命道理，知道要想解放全国人民，必须打倒蒋匪帮和驱逐帝国主义，建立人民民主政权。我经过了数年的战斗生活，对祖国的贡献很小，但在党的培养下，我得到了很高的荣誉。今年六月，上级调我来学习文化，并谆谆教导我们说：为了保卫祖国，巩固人民的胜利，必须建设一支强大的现代化国防军。如果没有文化，就不可能当一个更好的国防军战士。所以，我下了决心，一定学好文化。参军前我一字不识，参军后在战斗空隙虽然也学会了一些字，可是还差得很远。现在，经过三个多星期的学习，我已经能够写作一般的文章了，并且三会
    （会念、会写、会讲）两千三百多字。算术测验了两次，每次的成绩也都是满分。虽然获得了这些成绩，但这仅仅是学习的开始，还有许多的困难，自己的病常常犯，再碰上难学的东西，有时就信心不足。每当这个时候，党就教育我不要向困难低头。同时，也想到你和许多英雄模范那种钻研创造的精神，我又鼓起勇气加强信心来继续努力。
    今天，美帝国主义仍然继续侵略朝鲜，并蓄意破坏停战谈判，阴谋发动新的侵略战争，最近更变本加厉，派遣空军连续侵袭我国东北领空，滥施扫射，杀伤我国人民。为了回击美帝国主义这种狂妄无耻的挑衅行为，我们必须以继续加强抗美援朝的实际行动，来彻底粉碎它的侵略阴谋。我要更加努力学习文化，做一个现代化的国防军战士，保卫我们祖国的经济建设和人民的和平幸福生活；同时，也希望你在经济建设战线上，不懈不怠的积极劳动，开动脑筋，为创造更多的新纪录而奋斗。
    向战斗在增产节约战线上的劳动模范们致敬！并祝你在经济建设战线上胜利前进！
    郭俊卿  七月二十日
