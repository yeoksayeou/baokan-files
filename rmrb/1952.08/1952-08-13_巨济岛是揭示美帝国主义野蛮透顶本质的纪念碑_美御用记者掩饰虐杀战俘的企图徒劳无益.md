Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th -- The U.S. Information Service, an official U.S. agency, published on August 5th a ridiculous dispatch from Geoje Island by Howard, the Far East news editor of the "Christian Science Monitor." This dispatch distorted the truth of the massacre on Geoje Island nearly two months ago, attempting to portray Geoje Island, which has become an "island of terror" due to the insane slaughter of prisoners of war by the U.S. aggressors, as a "monument revealing the utterly savage nature of communism." It is obvious that the U.S. official propaganda machine only published such an article today as if it had found a treasure, and this is not accidental. The U.S. aggressors know that even if they can manipulate the voting machine at the Toronto International Red Cross Conference, they cannot shirk their responsibility for persecuting and slaughtering prisoners of war. Therefore, they hope that Howard can defend them as a so-called eyewitness. But unfortunately, like all American propagandists, Howard is a clumsy liar. Not only has he failed to achieve the goal of distorting the facts, but he has also made it clearer that it is the U.S. aggressors who brutally abuse and slaughter prisoners of war who are utterly savage.

Howard was an eyewitness to the massacre on Geoje Island on June 10th. According to reports from U.S. news agencies at the time, the U.S. aggressors used more than 1,000 soldiers in this massacre. Under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, they rushed into the prisoner-of-war camp No. 76 and fired about 1,000 flamethrower rounds, concussion grenades, tear gas grenades, and rifle grenades at thousands of unarmed prisoners of war. U.S. soldiers stabbed and hacked prisoners of war with bayonets and threw concussion grenades into the densely packed prisoner groups, resulting in casualties everywhere. The U.S. executioner, Boatner, admitted that 170 prisoners of war were killed or injured in this massacre. Even Howard had to admit that he "walked through Camp 76, which was still on fire and the air was filled with tear gas." He admitted that the prisoners of war hid in trenches to "escape the United Nations forces' concussion grenades, tear gas, and tanks," and said, "more than 30 prisoners were killed." However, after he was forced by the facts to downplay the behavior of the U.S. aggressors, which showed their utterly savage nature, he obviously felt that even this understatement would inevitably arouse dissatisfaction and anger among the American people and the people of the world towards the inhuman behavior of the U.S. aggressors. Therefore, he quickly repeated the lies of Clark and Boatner, saying that the prisoners of war had powerful handmade knives, and that U.S. soldiers did not fire a single shot, and even that the more than 30 prisoners of war who were killed were not killed by the U.S. military, but by the prisoners themselves! Thus, Howard came to the startling conclusion: "This is a vivid picture showing communist terrorist activities." According to Howard's logic, it seems that flamethrowers, grenades, tanks, and bayonets cannot kill people, and only unarmed prisoners of war can kill people. The prisoners of war hid in trenches to escape the flamethrowers, concussion grenades, tear gas, and the tanks and infantry rushing towards them. This is a "terrorist activity," while using these vicious weapons against unarmed prisoners of war is in accordance with the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. How absurd and shameless! It can be seen that in order to cover up the utterly savage behavior of the U.S. aggressors, Howard had to fall into ridiculous incoherence.

In his dispatch, Howard also shamelessly spread rumors that our captured personnel were killing each other in the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island. In fact, this lie had long been debunked. Everyone still remembers that after the Dodd incident, the U.S. aggressors frantically tried every means to deny their crimes of murdering and abusing prisoners of war. One of them was to slander the large number of casualties among prisoners of war as a result of infighting among our captured personnel. But the truth of the matter was revealed long ago by Colson, the person in charge of the U.S. Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp at the time, in his reply to our captured personnel. He "admitted that there had been bloodshed, resulting in many prisoners of war being killed or injured," and he also guaranteed that he "would do everything in his power to prevent violent acts and bloodshed from happening again." According to Colson's statement published by the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, he admitted to this crime after receiving instructions from his superiors to "not admit anything untrue." According to reports from our captured personnel Wang Jiati and Tan Guangqing, who were forced by the U.S. side to engage in espionage activities in our rear areas, the U.S. side often subjected them to illegal torture, beatings, and even executions in their prisoner-of-war camps in order to force our captured personnel to "refuse repatriation." Choi Song-ok, a Korean People's Army sergeant who escaped from Camp 76 on Geoje Island, also accused that there were "four gallows used to kill and threaten our captured personnel" in Camp 76. In the face of these many witnesses, Howard's lies appear extremely shameless.

It can be seen that in all of Howard's rumors and lies, there is nothing new. What he said was said by Clark, Boatner, and many U.S. news agencies long ago. He just copied these lies in order to get a few dollars from Wall Street. The facts have fully demonstrated that Geoje Island is a monument revealing the utterly savage nature of U.S. imperialism; liars like Howard, like Clark, Boatner, and Harrison, are all products of this utterly savage imperialism. As long as they can get dollars, they can do anything shameless and tell any vile lies.

### 巨济岛是揭示美帝国主义野蛮透顶本质的纪念碑  美御用记者掩饰虐杀战俘的企图徒劳无益

    巨济岛是揭示美帝国主义野蛮透顶本质的纪念碑
    美御用记者掩饰虐杀战俘的企图徒劳无益
    【新华社开城十二日电】美国官方机关美国新闻处在八月五日发表了“基督教科学箴言报”远东新闻编辑海瓦德从巨济岛发出的一篇荒诞的通讯。这篇通讯歪曲了将近两个月以前美方在巨济岛的大屠杀的真相，企图将由于美国侵略者疯狂虐杀战俘而成为“恐怖之岛”的巨济岛，说成是“揭示共产主义野蛮透顶本质的纪念碑”。显而易见，美国官方宣传机关迟至今天才把这样一篇文章如获至宝地发表出来，并不是偶然的。美国侵略者知道，他们纵然能够在多伦多国际红十字大会上操纵表决机器，却并不能就此推卸他们迫害和屠杀战俘的罪责，因此他们指望海瓦德能够以所谓目击者的身份替他们辩护。但是不幸得很，像所有美国的宣传家一样，海瓦德是一个拙劣的撒谎者。他不但没有能够达到歪曲事实的目的，反而使人更清楚地看到：野蛮透顶的不是别人，正是残暴地虐待和屠杀战俘的美国侵略者。
    海瓦德是六月十日巨济岛上大屠杀案的目击者，据美国通讯社当时透露，美国侵略者在这一次大屠杀中使用了一千多名士兵，他们在坦克和装甲车掩护下冲入第七十六号战俘营场，向赤手空拳的数千名战俘发射了约一千发喷火弹、震荡手榴弹、催泪性手榴弹和枪榴弹。美国士兵用刺刀刺死和砍劈战俘，并且往挤得密密的俘虏群中扔震荡手榴弹，以致战俘死伤遍地。美国刽子手波纳承认在这次屠杀中死伤战俘达一百七十人。就是海瓦德也不得不承认他在事后“走过第七十六号营场，当时这个营场仍在着火，空气中有催泪性毒气”。他承认战俘们藏在壕沟里面“躲避联合国军的震荡手榴弹，催泪性毒气和坦克”，并且说“有三十多个俘虏被击毙”。但是，在他被事实所迫，不得不轻描淡写地承认了美国侵略者这种表现他们的野蛮透顶本质的行为之后，他显然感觉到即使是这种轻描淡写的暴露也必然会引起美国人民和世界人民对美国侵略者这种不人道行为的不满与愤怒，因此，他赶紧重复克拉克和波纳的一套谎话，说什么战俘们有厉害的手制的刀子，还说美国士兵一枪未放，甚至说被击毙的三十多名战俘不是美军打死的，而是俘虏自己杀死的！这样海瓦德于是得出一个惊人的结论说：“这是一幅显示共产党恐怖行动的生动图画。”按照海瓦德的逻辑，似乎喷火弹、手榴弹、坦克、刺刀都不能杀人，而只有赤手空拳的战俘才能杀人。战俘躲在壕沟里以逃避向他们发射去的喷火弹、震荡手榴弹、催泪性毒气和向他们冲去的坦克和步兵，这是一种“恐怖行动”，而使用这些恶毒的武器来对付赤手空拳的战俘，倒是符合于日内瓦战俘公约的行为。这是多么荒谬与无耻！人们可以看出，海瓦德为了掩饰美国侵略者的野蛮透顶的行为，就不能不使自己陷于可笑的语无伦次的地步。
    海瓦德在他的通讯里还无耻地造谣说我方被俘人员在巨济岛战俘营中自相残杀。其实这个谎言也是早就破产了的。大家都还记得，在杜德事件发生以后，美国侵略者在曾经手忙脚乱地想尽各种办法来抵赖他们屠杀虐待战俘的罪行，其中之一就是把战俘的大量伤亡污蔑说是我方被俘人员自相残杀的结果。但是事实的真相早就由当时的美方巨济岛战俘营负责人柯尔生在给我方被俘人员的答复中说出来了。他“承认有过流血事发生，结果有许多战俘被打死或打伤”，他还保证“愿尽自己的一切力量，使暴力行动与流血事件不再发生”。而根据美国众议院军事委员会所公布的柯尔生的声明，他是在获得他的上级总部的“不要承认任何不真实的事情”的指示之后承认了这一罪行的。根据被美方强迫派来我方后方地区从事特务工作的我方被俘人员王家悌、谭广清等人的报告，美方为了强迫我方被俘人员“拒绝遣返”，经常在其战俘营中对他们进行非法刑讯、吊打以至处死。从巨济岛七十六号战俘营中脱险归来的朝鲜人民军下士崔松玉也控诉说：在七十六号战俘营中有“用以屠杀和威胁我们被俘人员的四个绞刑台”。在这许多人证面前，海瓦德的谎言就显得极端无耻了。
    人们可以看到，在海瓦德的所有这些造谣撒谎中，一点没有什么新的东西，他所说的话，都是克拉克、波纳以及许多美国通讯社早就说过了的，他只是为了获得华尔街的几块美元，把这些谎话照抄一遍而已。事实已经完全说明：巨济岛是揭示美帝国主义野蛮透顶本质的纪念碑；海瓦德之流的撒谎家，和克拉克、波纳、哈利逊一样，都是这个野蛮透顶的帝国主义的产物，他们只要能得到美元，是什么无耻的事情都干得出，什么下流的谎话都说得出的。
