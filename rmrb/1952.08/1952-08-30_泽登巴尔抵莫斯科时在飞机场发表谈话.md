Xinhua News Agency, August 29th, Moscow dispatch: TASS Moscow dispatch: Upon arriving in Moscow, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, Tsedenbal, delivered the following speech at the airport: Dear comrades!

	As I now arrive in the capital of the Soviet Union—Moscow—I would like to extend on behalf of the Mongolian people our deep gratitude and heartfelt congratulations to the great fraternal Soviet people, and convey to our friends and protectors—the entire friendly Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the great friend of the Mongolian people—Marshal J.V. Stalin—the warmest and most sincere gratitude from our people and the government of the Mongolian People's Republic for their constant care and the valuable assistance they have consistently provided in the construction of the Mongolian People's Republic.

	The powerful, constructive, and creative labor of the Soviet people, who stand at the forefront of the invincible camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, the epoch-making achievements they have attained in the victorious construction of communism, and the grand new plan of the next Soviet Five-Year Plan—all these inspire the Mongolian people to engage in peaceful labor, thereby further promoting and consolidating the economic, cultural, and political development of the Mongolian People's Republic.

	The unbreakable friendship of many years between the Soviet and Mongolian peoples and the truly fraternal, selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to Mongolia have been and will continue to be a constant source of inspiration and joy for the Mongolian people, the unshakable foundation of all their current and future victories, and a strong guarantee of the freedom and independence of our people.

	This fraternal and unbreakable friendship between the Mongolian and Soviet peoples is the pride and hope of the Mongolian people.

	For the benefit of our working people, for the cause of peace and friendship among nations, the Mongolian People's Republic is expanding and consolidating its international ties and fraternal cooperation with other friendly nations; in consolidating and promoting such ties and cooperation, we have always received and continue to receive assistance from our powerful friend, the Soviet Union, as well as from the wise teacher of the Mongolian people, Comrade J.V. Stalin. Due to the defeat of Japanese imperialism, and especially due to the great victory of the hundreds of millions of friendly Chinese people, our international position has been unprecedentedly consolidated; due to the glorious historical victory of the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, the Mongolian and Chinese peoples have the closest and ever-strengthening friendly relations.

	As long as the Mongolian people continue to receive the multifaceted assistance of the Soviet Union, consolidate their fraternal friendship with the great Soviet people, and their friendship and cooperation with the great Chinese People and the People's Democracies, as long as they follow the path indicated by the great sons and beloved leaders of our people, Sukhe-Bator and Choibalsan, the Mongolian people will surely be able to achieve further victories in peaceful, constructive labor.

	Long live the great Soviet Union—the strong bastion of world peace!

	May the sincere and fraternal friendship between our two peoples flourish!

	Glory to the great leader of the people, the wise teacher and friend of the Mongolian people—Comrade J.V. Stalin!

    泽登巴尔抵莫斯科时在飞机场发表谈话
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席泽登巴尔抵达莫斯科时，在机场发表谈话如下：亲爱的同志们！
    当我现在抵达苏联首都——莫斯科——的时候，我谨代表蒙古人民向伟大的兄弟般的苏联人民致深切的感激与由衷的祝贺，并把我国人民和蒙古人民共和国政府的最热烈的衷心的感激，转达给我们的朋友和保护者——全体友好的苏联人民、苏联政府和蒙古人民的伟大朋友——约·维·斯大林大元帅，感谢他们的经常关怀和在蒙古人民共和国建设过程中经常给予的宝贵援助。
    站在不可战胜的和平、民主与社会主义阵营前列的苏联人民的强有力的、具有建设性与创造性的劳动，他们在胜利的共产主义建设中得到的划时代的成就，苏联的下一个五年计划的伟大的新方案——这一切都鼓舞蒙古人民从事和平劳动，借以进一步促进与巩固蒙古人民共和国的经济、文化和政治的发展。
    苏联人民与蒙古人民之间存在着的许多年的牢不可破的友谊和苏联对蒙古的真正兄弟般的无私的援助，过去是、今后也还是蒙古人民的经常的鼓舞力量与快乐的源泉，是他们目前和将来的一切胜利的不可动摇的基础，是我国人民的自由与独立的强有力的保证。
    蒙古人民和苏联人民的这种兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊是蒙古人民的骄傲和希望。
    为了我国劳动人民的利益，为了和平事业与各国友谊，蒙古人民共和国正在扩展与巩固它和其他友邦的国际联系与兄弟般的合作；在巩固和促进这种联系与合作方面，我们一向得到、现在也仍然得到我们强有力的朋友苏联以及蒙古人民的英明导师约·维·斯大林同志的帮助。由于击溃了日本帝国主义，特别是由于亿万友好的中国人民获得了伟大胜利，我国的国际地位有了空前的巩固；由于中国人民得到了光荣的历史性的胜利以及成立了以毛泽东主席为首的中华人民共和国，蒙古人民和中国人民有了最亲密和日益增强的友谊关系。
    只要蒙古人民经常得到苏联的多方面的帮助，巩固他们与伟大的苏联人民的兄弟般的友谊以及他们与伟大的中国人民和各人民民主国家的友谊与合作，只要遵循我们人民伟大的儿子与敬爱的领袖苏赫—巴托尔及乔巴山所指示的道路，蒙古人民就一定能够在和平的、建设性的劳动中，得到进一步的胜利。
    伟大的苏联——世界和平的坚强堡垒——万岁！
    愿我们两国人民的真诚的兄弟般的友谊发扬光大！
    光荣归于伟大的人民领袖、蒙古人民的英明导师与朋友——约·维·斯大林同志！
