    Combat Hero Li Wanyu on the Cultural Front
    Qiao Lin
    Among the delegates attending the First National Congress of Combat Heroes was a hero named Li Wanyu. Li Wanyu was an outstanding Communist Party member, his chest adorned with medals, who had performed eight major merits and five minor merits for the people.
    Li Wanyu had worked for others since he was a child and never attended school. When he came to Beijing for the meeting in 1950, he was still illiterate. After seeing all kinds of new tanks, artillery, and airplanes in Tiananmen Square, in addition to being happy, he had this thought: "I am still an illiterate person; how can I master these new weapons?" When the combat heroes were signing the peace declaration, Li Wanyu's heart was pounding. He picked up the pen and wrote "Li Wan" in a crooked manner. He could not write the word "Yu" no matter what. Seeing that others were waiting to sign, he blushed and drew a circle under "Li Wan." After signing, he felt very sad: "I can't even sign a peace declaration properly. How can I use new weapons to defend the motherland and world peace?" He thought about it again and again, and couldn't even close his eyes at night. Finally, he made up his mind: "I must strive to improve my education!"
    He expressed his determination to learn to read to the heroes who attended the meeting. On the train back to the unit, he took out a notebook and asked his comrades to write some characters to teach him. After returning to the unit, the military leaders asked him what he wanted. He said: "I have no other requests, only one: let me learn to read!" The military leaders nodded and smiled.
    Li Wanyu entered the training regiment to study. He studied culture for more than three months before being hospitalized due to illness. In the hospital, he did not relax his studies. His cultural textbook was placed beside him, and he would pick it up and read it whenever his mind was clear. After staying in the hospital for more than three months, he could recognize more than a thousand characters when he was discharged.
    The unit began a rapid literacy campaign, and he was transferred to the Second Guard Company to participate in pilot studies. In his studies, he truly did not let a minute go by in vain. During the day, when he felt dizzy from studying in the classroom, he would take the single-character booklet to the hilltop to read. At night, he would lie in bed and close his eyes, recalling the single characters he had learned during the day. If he couldn't remember a character, he would use a flashlight to illuminate the single-character booklet to see what the character looked like. In the morning, as soon as he got out of bed and entered the classroom, he would carefully write out the single characters he had learned the day before. He said: "If you recall the single characters at night and write them out in the morning, the single characters won't be able to run away." Due to his diligent study, he learned phonetic symbols and pinyin in four hours, and more than a thousand new characters in six days. Adding the more than a thousand characters he originally knew, he had learned all the more than two thousand characters in the study book.
    Li Wanyu returned to his company with great joy. He was assigned to the fourth-grade class. As the platoon leader of the second platoon, he not only continued to actively engage in learning himself but also vigorously led and motivated the entire platoon to study.
    At the beginning of the study, some comrades lacked a correct understanding of the study and lacked confidence in their studies. Comrade Yu Gen believed that his mind was rusty and that studying would be useless. Li Wanyu told him the story of "the old platoon leader learning culture without fear of difficulties" and said, "Comrade, didn't I used to be illiterate? What about now? I have already learned all the characters in the single-character booklet. We have eliminated the eight million Chiang Kai-shek bandits with legs. Can't we deal with these few thousand single characters without legs? Make up your mind to learn! I guarantee that you won't fall behind." Yu Gen was so moved that he tightly grasped his hand and said, "Platoon leader, please rest assured, I will study hard!"
    For the sake of the entire platoon's learning, Li Wanyu considered day and night: "How can we ensure that everyone learns well and that no one falls behind?" He thought that to achieve this goal, it was necessary to leverage the power of the masses. Therefore, he selected two comrades from each squad to serve as assistant teachers, one to teach the southern comrades and one to teach the northern comrades. He himself also served as an assistant teacher, responsible for helping the eight comrades who everyone thought were the most difficult to teach.
    During the intense study period, the platoon still had some comrades who had to stand guard and go on errands every day as usual. These comrades who did not attend classes during the day had to make up for their lessons in the evening. Sometimes, when three comrades from different grades went on errands, the teachers had to take turns helping them make up for their lessons. Seeing this situation, Li Wanyu felt that this was a waste of manpower and time and came up with a new method: every day, the comrades from the same grade would be assigned to stand guard and go on errands, and in the evening, the teacher only needed to conduct one centralized makeup lesson.
    Peng, the company instructor, was from the south. During "dictation," everyone could not understand what he was saying. If they could not understand what he was saying, how could they write it down? This difficulty had to be overcome with the help of the instructor. Li Wanyu thought of a solution himself and also researched it with everyone. A solution was finally found. He suggested that Instructor Peng make special preparations before each "dictation": first, read the text to be dictated several times, and have a comrade with correct pronunciation listen and point out any unclear pronunciations. After the pronunciations were completely accurate, then teach "dictation." This method was widely welcomed by teachers and students.
    When practicing writing, he encouraged the comrades to boldly ask questions and answer questions on the wall newspaper to practice writing. However, some comrades were still unable to grasp the essentials of writing, so he told everyone: "Start by writing about things you are familiar with, write whatever you think, write whatever you see. That is the trick to writing. If you see that the squad leader is studying well, write about the squad leader's learning spirit." As a result, the wall newspaper column was filled every day. Mutual questions and answers, mutual challenges, and mutual praises encouraged everyone's learning enthusiasm and also allowed everyone to practice writing. Li Wanyu also stipulated that the squad leaders, deputy squad leaders, assistant teachers, and mutual aid group leaders should report to him once a day, and the content of the report should be written on a piece of paper. After reading the reports, he would write down the important points and summarize them separately to the party members, the Communist Youth League members, and the masses every week, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages of learning and the existing problems. He would also carefully revise each person's report and then return it to everyone. The comrades said: "The method that the platoon leader thought of is really good. The platoon leader understands the students' situation, everyone practices writing, and it saves time for reporting together. It's really a triple win!"
    In order to constantly stimulate the learning enthusiasm of all the comrades in the platoon and prevent anyone from falling behind, Li Wanyu also selected a comrade with good study habits from each squad to form a commando group, which regularly conducted random tests in each squad. If they found that the results were good, they would praise them. If they found that the results were poor, the commando group would provide tutoring and be responsible for helping them catch up. Li Wanyu carried a loudspeaker with him every day. When he encountered someone who was studying well, he would broadcast praise in a timely manner. When he encountered any good experiences, he would broadcast and introduce them in a timely manner.
    Under such heavy work tasks, Li Wanyu did not relax his own studies at all. After his homework was corrected by the teacher, he would always look at it carefully several times. If the teacher drew red lines next to some sentences, he would repeatedly study where the problem was. After finding the problem, he would create suitable sentences again for the teacher to see until the teacher said it was correct. The teacher also circled any misspelled or wrongly written characters in the homework. When Li Wanyu saw a red circle, it was like seeing an enemy, and he would stare at it intently, always trying to figure out the reason for the mistake. Because of his diligent study, the red lines and red circles drawn by the teacher in his homework became fewer and fewer.
    Li Wanyu not only studied well himself and led the entire platoon to study well but also often told the comrades in other platoons about his experiences and insights. He often said to the comrades: "Learning well by yourself will not eliminate the enemy; learning well by the whole platoon will not eliminate the enemy; we must exchange experiences with each other; so that all the comrades in the army can learn well, in order to eliminate the enemy!"
    Now, Li Wanyu has entered the second-grade class to study. His platoon has become the platoon with the best learning results in the entire company, and a large part of the comrades have entered the higher grades to study. The documents that had been packed away in bundles for many days have now been taken out and placed in drawers or carried with them. He used to be unable to write his own name well, but now he can read the entire "Communist Party Member Textbook" and "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members." Not long ago, but he and his platoon have undergone great changes. Yes, this is a great change! These people's heroes created many miracles on the military front in the past, and now they have created new miracles on the cultural front. Li Wanyu, this outstanding people's hero, this combat hero who met Chairman Mao in Beijing, has once again made a great contribution in his studies and gloriously participated in the Third Cultural Teaching Congress of the South China Military Region. At the meeting, he met again some of the nationally renowned heroes he had met in Beijing, as well as some new heroes on the cultural front. He once again expressed his determination to the heroes: "We have gone from being illiterate to initially acquiring culture. This is a great change; this is also the beginning of a greater change! I must consolidate my existing achievements, continue to improve my education, and advance towards the goal of a modern national defense army!"

    战斗英雄李万余在文化战线上
    乔林
    在出席第一次全国战斗英雄代表会议的代表里，有一个英雄的名字叫李万余。李万余是一个胸前挂满奖章、为人民立了八大功五小功的优秀的共产党员。
    李万余从小就给人做工，没进过学堂门，一九五○年到北京开会的时候，还是个文盲。他在天安门看见了各种新式的坦克、大炮和飞机以后，除了高兴以外，还有这样一个想法：“我现在还是个睁眼瞎子，怎么能掌握这些新式武器呢？”战斗英雄们在和平宣言上签名的时候，李万余的心直跳，他提起笔，歪歪扭扭写了“李万”两个字，“余”字怎么也写不上来了。他见别人都等着笔签名，就红着脸在“李万”下面画了一个圈。签了名，他心里很难过：“我在和平宣言上签个名也签不好，怎么能使用新武器来保卫祖国和世界和平呢？”他想来想去，夜里连眼也合不上，最后他下了决心：“我一定要努力提高文化！”
    他向到会的英雄们表示了自己要学文化的决心。在回部队的时候，他坐在火车上，就拿出个本子，请同志们写些字教给他认。回到部队以后，军首长问他有什么要求，他说：“别的要求什么也没有，只有一个要求：让我去学文化！”军首长点头笑了。
    李万余进教导队学习了。他学了三个多月文化，就因病进了医院。他在医院里，并没有放松学习，文化课本就放在自己身旁，脑子清醒一点就拿起课本念。他住了三个多月医院，出院的时候他已经能认一千多字了。
    部队开始速成识字运动，他被调到警二连去参加试点学习。在学习中，他真是连一分钟也不让它白白过去。白天，他在课堂里学得头昏脑胀了，就把单字本带到山头上去念。晚上，他躺在床上，又闭着眼睛，回忆一天学过的单字。有的字记不起来了，他就用手电照照单字本，看看那个字到底是啥样子。早上，他一起床走进课堂，把头一天学过的单字仔细默写一遍。他说：“晚上把单字回忆一遍，早上默写一遍，单字就开不了小差。”由于他的勤学苦练，他四个钟头学会了注音符号和拼音，六天学会了一千多生字。加上他原识的一千多字，他已经把学习本上两千多字全部学会了。
    李万余带着满心的高兴，回到了自己的连队。他被编到初四级学习。他是二排的排长，他不但自己继续积极地投入了学习，而且还有力地领导带动了全排的学习。
    学习刚开始，有些同志对学习缺乏正确的认识，学习信心也不足。余根同志认为自己脑子上了锈，学了也是白搭。李万余就讲“老排长学文化不怕困难”的故事给他听，并且说：“同志，你看我从前不也是一字不识吗？现在呢？已经把单字本上的字全学会了。咱们把长着腿的八百万蒋匪也消灭了，对这没有长腿的几千单字还没办法吗？你下决心学吧！我保证叫你不掉队。”感动得余根紧紧握住他的手说：“排长同志，请你放心，我一定好好学习！”
    为了全排学习，李万余不分日夜地考虑：“怎样才能叫大伙都学得好，叫一人也不掉队呢？”他想，要达到这个目的，必须发挥群众的力量；于是，他从每个班里挑出两个同志当小教员，一个教南方同志，一个教北方同志；他自己也当了小教员，负责帮助八个大家认为最难教的同志。
    在学习紧张进行的时候，排里还是照例每天有些同志要站哨、出公差。这些白天没有听课的同志，到晚上就要补课；有时候，有三个不同年级的同志出了公差，就得叫教员轮流去帮他们补课。李万余看见这种情况，觉得这样太浪费人力和时间，想出了一个新的方法：每天都叫同一个年级的同志去站哨、出公差，晚上只要教员去集中补一次课就行了。
    连里的彭教员，是个南方人，“听写”的时候，大家听不清他的话。听不清他说的是什么，怎么写呢？这个困难要帮助教员克服。李万余一面自己想办法，一面又和大家一起研究。办法到底被他找着了，他建议彭教员在每次“听写”以前做好特殊的准备工作：先把要念的课文多念几遍，叫一个发音正确的同志听着，指出发音不清的地方，完全都读准了以后，再去教“听写”。这个办法受到教员和学员的普遍欢迎。
    在练习写话的时候，他鼓励同志们在墙报上大胆地提问题和解答问题，来练习写话。但是有些同志还摸不着写话的要领，他就告诉大家：“先从自己熟悉的事情写起，想什么就写什么，看见什么就写什么，这就是写话的窍门。你看见班长学习好，就把班长的学习精神写出来。”这一来，墙报栏上每天都贴得满满的了。互相问答、互相挑战和互相表扬，又鼓励了大家的学习情绪，又叫大家练习了写话。李万余又规定正副班长、小教员、互助组长每天向他作一次汇报，汇报的内容要写在纸条上。他看了汇报以后，把重要的地方记下来，每星期分别向党员和青年团团员和群众作一次总结，指出学习中的优缺点和存在的问题。他还把每人的汇报条仔细修改一遍，再发还给大家。同志们说：“排长想的这个办法真好，排长了解了学员情况，大家练习了写话，又节省了在一起汇报的时间，真是一举三得！”
    为了经常激发全排同志们的学习情绪和防止有人掉队，李万余又在每班抽一个学习好的同志，组织成突击组，经常到各班进行抽测。发现成绩好的就进行表扬，发现成绩较差的，就由突击组补课，负责叫他赶上去。李万余天天把广播筒带在身边，遇见学得好的就及时广播表扬，遇见有什么好的经验就及时广播介绍。
    在工作任务这样繁重的情况下，李万余一点儿也没放松自己的学习。他的作业给教员修改以后，他总要细心地看几遍，有些句子旁边被教员划上了红线，就再三研究毛病在哪里；找到毛病就又重新造合适的句子给教员看，直到教员说对了为止。作业上的一些错字，别字，教员也划上了红圈圈，李万余看见一个红圈圈，就像看见一个敌人一样，死死盯住它，总要把写错的原因捉摸出来。由于他这样刻苦地钻研，在他的作业中，教员划的红线红圈就愈来愈少了。
    李万余不但自己学习得好，把全排的学习领导得好，而且还经常把自己的经验和体会告诉别排的同志。他常对同志们说：“光自己学好了，消灭不了敌人；全排学好了，也消灭不了敌人；必须互相交流经验；叫全军的同志都学好，才能消灭敌人！”
    现在，李万余已经到高二级学习了。他的排成了全连学习成绩最好的排，有一大半同志都到高年级学习了。多少日子以来被打在被包里的文件，现在都拿出来，放到抽屉里或带在身上。他以前写不好自己的名字，现在能把“共产党员课本”和“论共产党员的修养”全部看下来。时间不长，但是他和他的排已经起了很大的变化。是的，这是一个很大的变化！这些人民的英雄们，过去在军事战线上创造了很多奇迹，现在又在文化战线上创造了新的奇迹。李万余，这个出色的人民功臣，这个到北京见过毛主席的战斗英雄，这次在学习中又立了一大功，光荣地参加了华南军区第三届文化教学代表大会。在会上，他又会见了在北京见过面的一些全国闻名的英雄，以及在文化战线上的一些新的英雄。他又向英雄们表示了决心：“我们从不识字到初步取得文化，这是一个很大的变化；这也是一个更大的变化的开始！我一定要巩固现有成绩，继续提高文化，向现代化国防军的目标前进！”
