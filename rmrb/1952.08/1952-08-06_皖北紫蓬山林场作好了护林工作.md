    Zibengshan Forest Farm in Northern Anhui Does a Good Job in Forest Protection
    Editor: There is a lot of wasteland in Zibengshan, Feixi County, Northern Anhui. After liberation, the People's Government established a forest farm here. The forest farm formulated a plan to eliminate barren mountains and wasteland, protecting the original wild trees on the one hand, and planting trees on a large scale on the other. However, the local people were accustomed to reclaiming wasteland by burning, and felling trees, sometimes cutting down even the small saplings.
    After the "Three-Anti" Movement this year, the enthusiasm of all the staff greatly increased. They took the initiative to contact the masses, strengthened the publicity and education work on afforestation and forest protection to the masses, and launched a large-scale afforestation and forest protection movement. In less than half a year, the forest farm reorganized and organized forest protection and soil conservation committees in fifteen townships in the surrounding four districts, seventy-four village-level forest protection and soil conservation general groups, and one hundred and eighty forest protection and soil conservation groups. In the past, many older children often cut down young trees along with grass when grazing and cutting grass. After receiving forest protection education, they not only stopped destroying trees themselves, but also actively prevented others from cutting down seedlings and cutting grass indiscriminately.
    Now the forest farm often goes to various villages to hold meetings to explain the policies of forest protection and afforestation, and uses slideshows for publicity. The forest farm has also formulated rules for logging trees with various villages. Villages needing timber must apply to the forest protection organization and be approved by the district government. The forest farm has also jointly stipulated pastures and grazing routes for grazing livestock with farmers, which not only takes care of the interests of the masses, but also does a good job in forest protection. The masses are very satisfied with these measures.

    皖北紫蓬山林场作好了护林工作
    编辑同志：皖北肥西县紫蓬山有很多荒地。解放以后，人民政府在这里设立了林场。林场订立了消灭荒山荒地的计划，一面保护原有的野生树木，一面大量地植树造林。但当地群众习惯于开荒烧垦、砍伐树木，有时把小树苗都砍光了。
    今年“三反”运动以后，全场职工的积极性大为提高，他们主动地联系群众，对群众加强了造林护林的宣教工作，展开了大规模的造林护林运动。在不到半年的时间内，林场改组和组织了周围四个区十五个乡的护林保土委员会、七十四个村的护林保土总组和一百八十个护林保土小组。过去许多年龄较大的儿童，在放牧和割草时，常把幼树连草一起砍去。他们受了护林教育以后，不但自己不再破坏林木，而且主动地阻止别人乱砍树苗和乱割草。
    现在林场经常到各村开会讲解护林造林政策，并用幻灯进行宣传。林场又和各村拟定了采伐树木的规则，各村需用木材，一定要向护林组织申请，经区政府批准。林场还和农民共同规定了放牧牲畜的牧场牧道，既照顾了群众利益，也作好了护林工作。群众对这些措施都很满意。    李星谷
