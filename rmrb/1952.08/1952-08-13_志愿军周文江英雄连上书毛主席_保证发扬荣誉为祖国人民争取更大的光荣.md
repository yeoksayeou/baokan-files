Volunteer Army Zhou Wenjiang Hero Company Writes to Chairman Mao
Guaranteeing to Carry Forward Honor and Win Greater Glory for the Motherland and People
Respected Chairman Mao: In order to defend the security of the motherland and world peace, we joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and went to the forefront of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. For nearly two years, we have completed all combat missions and were honored with the glorious title of "First-Class Meritorious Company" in the Second Battle. We know that our honor was obtained under the ardent support of the broad masses of people in the motherland, the correct command of the superiors, the strong cooperation of brother troops, and especially under the wise leadership of the Party and you. Therefore, this honor should belong to the Party, you, and the people of the motherland. We are determined to learn more modestly, maintain our honor, carry forward our honor, and win glory for our beloved leader! Win glory for the people of the motherland!

Chairman Mao! Every comrade in our company thinks of you all the time. In the most difficult environment and the most intense battles, the moment we think of you, we immediately gain infinite strength, and no difficulty can stop us. I remember during the Xixingli battle of the Changjin Lake campaign, in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees, we ate one meal of frozen potatoes every day. Under the cover of dozens of enemy planes and intense artillery fire, the enemy desperately tried to break through and attacked and counterattacked us frantically. The mountain was filled with smoke. In this most tense moment, we thought of the Party and of you, and immediately gained infinite courage. Political Instructor Zhu Liangyu shouted your name before sacrificing himself. The third platoon deputy's feet were frostbitten, and three toenails fell off, but he still insisted on fighting. Deputy Company Commander Zhou Helin and six comrades from the second platoon repelled three enemy charges, fought continuously for seventeen hours, held the mountain, and pinned down the enemy, and finally cooperated with brother troops to annihilate the enemy. Respected leader! It is you who encouraged us and gave us the strength to overcome all difficulties, enabling us to advance from victory to victory!

A few days ago, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Commemorative Medal was issued. Your golden image is hanging on our chests. The comrades all smiled and said, "Chairman Mao is with us every day, and our fighting will is even stronger." Chairman Mao! All of us comrades assure you: We are determined to work hard to improve our skills and improve our combat techniques in peacetime, and to eliminate the enemy more firmly and bravely in combat. We will definitely shatter the US imperialist conspiracy to expand the war of aggression and make the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Commemorative Medal even more glorious and splendid! The entire comrades of the Zhou Wenjiang Hero Company of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    志愿军周文江英雄连上书毛主席
    保证发扬荣誉为祖国人民争取更大的光荣
    敬爱的毛主席：为了保卫祖国的安全和世界和平，我们参加了中国人民志愿军，走上了抗美援朝的最前线。将近两年以来，我们完成了历次战斗任务，并在二次战役中荣获“一等功臣连”的光荣称号。我们知道，我们的荣誉是在祖国广大人民的热烈支援，是在上级首长的正确指挥和兄弟部队的有力配合，特别是在党和您的英明领导之下获得的。因此，这个荣誉，应该属于党和您以及祖国人民。我们决心更加虚心地学习，保持荣誉，发扬荣誉，为我们敬爱的领袖争光！为祖国人民争光！
    毛主席！我们全连每一个同志无时无刻不在想念着您。在最艰苦的环境和最激烈的战斗中，一想起您，我们立刻生长了无穷的力量，任何困难也不能阻挡我们。记得长津湖战役西兴里战斗时，在零下三十度的严寒中，我们每天吃一顿冰冻的土豆。敌人在数十架飞机和猛烈的炮火掩护下，拼死突围，疯狂地向我们攻击反扑。山头上打得烟火弥漫。在这最紧张的时候，我们想起了党，想起了您，就立刻增加了无限的勇气。政治指导员朱良玉同志在牺牲前高呼着您的名字。三排副的脚冻烂了，三个指甲冻掉了，还是坚持作战。副连长周和林同志和二排的六个同志，打退了敌人三次冲锋，连续战斗了十七小时，守住了山头，扭住了敌人，最后并配合兄弟部队，歼灭了敌人。敬爱的领袖！是您鼓舞着我们，给我们以排除万难的力量，使我们从胜利走向胜利！
    前几天，抗美援朝纪念章发下来了。您的金像挂在我们胸前。同志们都喜笑颜开地说：“毛主席天天跟我们在一起，我们的战斗意志更加坚强了。”毛主席！我们全体同志向您保证：我们决心在平时努力练好本领，提高战斗技术，在战斗中更加坚定勇敢地消灭敌人。我们一定粉碎美帝国主义企图扩大侵略战争的阴谋，让抗美援朝纪念章更加光辉灿烂！  中国人民志愿军周文江英雄连全体同志
