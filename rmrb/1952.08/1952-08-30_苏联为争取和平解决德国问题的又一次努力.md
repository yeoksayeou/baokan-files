    Another Soviet Effort to Achieve a Peaceful Resolution of the German Question
    On August 23rd, the Soviet government once again sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, suggesting that a four-power representative conference be held in October to discuss issues such as preparing a peace treaty with Germany and establishing an all-German government. This is another demonstration of the Soviet Union's unremitting efforts to restore German unity and peace. The Soviet government also published the U.S. government's note of July 10th, further exposing the conspiracy of the United States, Britain, and France to continue delaying the resolution of the German question. For the seven years since the end of World War II, the United States, Britain, and France have tried every possible means to obstruct the restoration of German peace and unity, in an attempt to permanently divide Germany and use West Germany as a base for aggression. This policy, which completely violates the interests of the German people and threatens world peace and security, has been strongly opposed by the German people and the people of the world. In contrast, the Soviet Union has continuously put forward proposals for a peaceful resolution of the German question over the past seven years, which have been warmly supported and praised by the people of Western Europe and the world.
    The unification of Germany can only be achieved through the establishment of an all-German government through free all-German elections. This is a fact that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France cannot deny. The people of all Germany are in favor of holding free elections, which shows that holding such elections is not only necessary but also entirely possible. However, the United States, Britain, and France insist on establishing an international investigation team that is unacceptable to the German people to investigate whether the conditions for holding elections exist. Their purpose is obviously not to prepare for elections but to obstruct their progress.
    The Soviet note advocates the rapid holding of a four-power representative conference to conduct direct negotiations on the conclusion of a peace treaty and other related issues. This is a legitimate way to peacefully resolve the German question. However, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are using the excuse that a peace treaty with Germany cannot be drafted before the establishment of an all-German government, and insist that the four-power conference be limited to discussing the establishment of an investigation team. This is an attempt to evade discussing the substantive issues related to German peace and unity, and to continue to delay a reasonable resolution of the German question.
    The Soviet government's note once again proves that the Soviet Union's consistent position on the German question is to fully respect German sovereignty, conform to the interests of the German people, and contribute to the peace and security of Europe and the world. Only by following the Soviet Union's proposal, with the four powers promptly drafting a draft peace treaty with Germany, and the German people freely electing to establish a unified all-German government, can Germany restore peace and unity at an early date and consolidate lasting peace in Europe.

### 苏联为争取和平解决德国问题的又一次努力

    苏联为争取和平解决德国问题的又一次努力
    苏联政府八月二十三日再度照会美英法三国政府，建议在十月举行四国代表会议，讨论准备对德和约及成立全德政府等问题。这又一次表明苏联为争取恢复德国统一与和平而进行着不懈的努力。苏联政府并发表了美国政府七月十日的照会，美英法三国继续拖延解决德国问题的阴谋是更加昭然若揭了。第二次世界大战结束七年以来，美英法三国千方百计阻挠德国和平与统一的恢复，以图永久分裂德国并利用西德作为侵略基地。这种完全违背德国人民利益、威胁世界和平与安全的政策，遭到德国人民和世界人民的强烈反对。与此相反，苏联七年来不断提出和平解决德国问题的建议，得到了西欧和世界各国人民的热烈拥护与赞扬。
    德国的统一只有通过全德自由选举成立全德政府才能实现，这是美英法三国政府也无法否认的事实。全德国的人民都赞成举行自由选举，说明进行这种选举不仅是必要的而且是完全可能的。但是，美英法三国却坚持要成立德国人民所不能接受的国际调查团，调查是否存在举行选举的条件。其目的显然不是为了筹备选举而是阻挠选举的进行。
    苏联照会主张迅速举行四国代表会议，就缔结和约及其他有关问题进行直接谈判，这是和平解决德国问题的正当途径。但是美英法三国政府竟以在全德政府未成立以前不能拟订对德和约为藉口，坚持四国会议只限于讨论关于成立调查团的问题。这是企图规避讨论有关德国和平与统一的实质问题，继续拖延德国问题的合理解决。
    苏联政府的照会，再次证明苏联关于德国问题的一贯主张，是完全尊重德国主权、符合德国人民利益的，并且有助于欧洲和世界的和平与安全。只有按照苏联的主张，由四国从速拟就对德和约草案，同时由德国人民自由选举成立全德统一政府，才能够使德国早日恢复和平与统一，巩固欧洲的持久和平。
