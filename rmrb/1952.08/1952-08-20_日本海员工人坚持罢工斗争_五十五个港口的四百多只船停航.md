Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The strike by Japanese seamen is continuing. The impact of the strike is growing. According to the Seamen's Union, as of 3:00 PM on the 18th, the strike had halted 424 ships in 55 ports across the country.

The seamen are striking to demand an increase in retirement allowances. They have already held two 48-hour strikes since August 7th, and started a 120-hour strike on the 15th. Because the capitalists are still insisting on refusing the seamen's reasonable demands, the Central Executive Committee of the Seamen's Union decided on the 18th that after the 120-hour strike ends, it will immediately launch another 72-hour strike starting from 0:00 on the 20th.

In other news: Japanese workers belonging to the U.S. military's Yokosuka Ordnance Depot at Oppama held a 24-hour strike on the 15th to demand wage increases and improved working conditions, and were preparing to hold a second strike on the 19th. On the 17th, the U.S. military authorities were forced to accept the workers' demands, and the strike ended victoriously.

    日本海员工人坚持罢工斗争
    五十五个港口的四百多只船停航
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：日本海员工人的罢工仍在继续中。罢工的影响越来越大，据海员工会的消息，到十八日下午三时为止，罢工已使全国五十五个港口的四百二十四只船停止航行。
    海员工人是为了要求增加退职金而罢工的。他们从八月七日起接连举行了两次四十八小时的罢工，并从十五日起举行一百二十小时的罢工。因为资方迄今还在坚持拒绝海员工人的合理要求，海员工会中央执行委员会已在十八日决定在一百二十小时的罢工结束以后，紧接着将从二十日零时起再举行一次七十二小时的罢工。
    又讯：属于驻日美军兵站司令部追滨兵工场的日本工人，为了要求增加工资和改善劳动条件，曾在十五日举行了二十四小时的罢工，并准备在十九日举行第二次罢工。十七日，美军当局已被迫接受工人的要求，罢工已胜利结束。
