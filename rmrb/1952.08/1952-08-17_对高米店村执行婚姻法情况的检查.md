    Inspection of the Implementation of the Marriage Law in Gaomi Dian Village

    Editor: After the People's Daily published an article by Lansheng in the "Readers' Letters" column on July 17th, entitled "Suggestion to Inspect the Implementation of the Marriage Law in Gaomi Dian Village," the People's Supervision Committee of our county, the Democratic Women's Federation of the county, and the Democratic Women's Federation of the Third District jointly sent people to Gaomi Dian Village to conduct an inspection. Although the situation reflected by Comrade Lansheng did not completely match the facts, it is a fact that village cadre Wang Wenxi accepted "bride price" when his daughter got married. This bad habit of buying and selling marriage is not allowed by the Marriage Law. This shows that we have not done enough to implement the Marriage Law. We have criticized Wang Wenxi's mistake at a mass meeting and conducted publicity on the Marriage Law. We also criticized the village head Wang Tingxiang for his wrong attitude towards his wife and asked Wang Tingxiang to make a self-criticism. In the future, we must strengthen the publicity of the Marriage Law and strive to implement it.

### 对高米店村执行婚姻法情况的检查

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对高米店村执行婚姻法情况的检查
    编辑同志：七月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载岚生“建议检查高米店村执行婚姻法的情况”一文后，我县人民监察委员会、县民主妇女联合会和第三区民主妇女联合会立即派人共同到高米店村作了检查。虽然岚生同志所反映的情况和事实有一些不符的地方，但村干部王文喜在女儿结婚时接受“彩礼”却是事实。这种买卖婚姻的恶习，是婚姻法所不容许的。这可以说明我们对婚姻法的贯彻还不够。我们已经在一次群众大会上，把王文喜的这一错误作了批判，并进行了婚姻法的宣传。我们对村长王廷祥对待老婆的错误态度，也进行了批评，并让王廷祥作了检讨。今后，我们一定要加强对婚姻法的宣传，并努力予以贯彻执行。
