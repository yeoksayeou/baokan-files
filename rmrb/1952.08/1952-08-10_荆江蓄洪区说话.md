Editor's Note: This "Dandan" (a type of folk singing) is one of the artistic programs participating in the sports competition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's "August 1st" Army Day. The author, Wang Fengming, is a hero from a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, who has been awarded four major merits and one minor merit, and received the "Hard Struggle" Medal and the "Brave" Medal, and was awarded the honorary title of "People's Hero". Wang Fengming is from Haicheng, Liaodong, and was originally a carpenter. He only attended school for two or three years. After joining the army in 1948, he often performed "Kuaiban" (a type of rhythmic storytelling), and later practiced writing, compiling more than a dozen scripts to coordinate with the company's educational work. "Speaking for the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area" is one of his excellent works. Due to space limitations, a section has been abridged in this publication.

The Jingjiang River, rolling with waves. To safely divert the flood, a sluice gate was built, eradicating the thousand-year flood disaster, and the flood diversion area happily spoke.

(Tune of "Taiping Nian")

(Spoken) It speaks of me!

(Sung) Called the flood diversion area, truly of great capacity; the people happily praise me. Living in the border area between Hubei and Hunan, growing up in the new country of the Mao Zedong era.

I wanted to be born a long time ago, but I hated that the society at that time was too corrupt; the reactionary governments were all bastards, and never planned to build anything, they only knew how to exploit.

The water of the Yangtze River rushed out of the Three Gorges, and it was really ferocious when it flowed to the Jingjiang area. The flow is rapid and the waves are high, but the Jingjiang River channel is curved and narrow. During the rainy season, the flood rises, and the river embankment is often washed away by the water, and thousands of acres of fertile land become a vast expanse of water. Children can't find their mothers, and everyone loses their homes.

The Kuomintang reactionaries don't care about people's lives, those guys should really be killed, using the name of repairing the embankment, only talking and not doing, scraping oil everywhere. They cheated the money into their hands, and spent it on eating, drinking, whoring and gambling. If they were to repair the embankment, they wouldn't be willing to spend it. They don't care about the people suffering from disasters, staring with two eyes, they pretend to be blind.

(Tune of "Yun Su")

Fortunately, the Communist Party came, and the people turned over to be masters, the working class came to lead, and Chairman Mao was wise and had a way. Eliminate water disasters and develop water conservancy, and call for flood diversion and repair of sluice gates. Therefore, I was born and serve everyone in society. I was born to be quiet and not to move, I don't want to walk or climb. My whole body is very strong; steel and iron bones for a brain, iron plate lips, cement chin; for hygiene and to save trouble, I didn't keep my hair.

My mouth has fifty-four throat holes, it is a modern large sluice gate. The diversion dike is my two big dragon whiskers; the windbreak forest and bank protection stones are my armor. My head is in Taipingkou, Hubei, and my feet extend to Huangshan, Hunan. If you ask how big I am, take a look at the People's Daily and you will know.

(Tune of "Jinqian Lianhualuo")

I guard Jingjiang with great prestige, and my name spreads all over the world. International friends have also come to visit me, from various countries in Asia and the Pacific. I can't remember the exact day they came, it was probably before June 18th. They first went to Huangshantou, and looked at my tail - that is the control gate. Then they came to Taipingkou and visited my head.

They said: If this gate were put in a capitalist country, it would take ten or eight years to complete it.

They also said: Only the People's Republic of China can truly do what it says. Seeing your strength is so strong, it makes our confidence in peace even greater. I was so happy to hear these words that I bloomed, and I opened my mouth so wide that I couldn't close my teeth.

(Shandong Kuaishu)

I feel that the motherland is really great, and the plan was completed in just over two months. This is all, Chairman Mao's leadership has a way; and that, people from all walks of life actively participate. The Soviet elder brother is also very concerned, and sent Comrade Bukov, a water conservancy expert. The workers, peasants and soldiers are even more incomparable, each and every one of them is enthusiastic and energetic. The workers went to install the big sluice gate, and the farmers carried soil and dug mud. And our People's Liberation Army, wherever there is difficulty, there he is, regardless of day or night, sunny, rainy, or strong wind. It's like going to the battlefield, charging into battle to kill the enemy. This is really the power of the masses to move mountains, and even rivers and seas can be moved. The great task was completed ahead of schedule, and a completion monument was built on my head. I am like a unicorn king, crawling on the riverbank to observe. If the flood doesn't come, I rest, and when the flood comes, I bare my teeth. Open my flood inlet, and swallow it in one gulp, like drinking fragrant tea when thirsty, drinking tens of billions of tons is nothing. After eating and drinking enough, close my mouth, and pull it little by little into Dongting Lake. If Dongting Lake can't hold it, it doesn't matter, I still have a control gate on my butt. Close it and it's fine, it's guaranteed to be safe. The folks should just focus on production, from now on, there is no need to worry, be afraid, or flee in all directions. I am not saying that we can be careless and not be vigilant, but we should actively prevent floods and add oil. This is just the beginning of water control, and it will only be a complete conquest when the water damage is completely turned into water conservancy. The people's lives will always be guaranteed, and there will be a good harvest in a peaceful and prosperous land. The country's construction will be even more developed, so that the motherland will move towards industrialization as soon as possible, and stride forward towards a communist society, at that time, a happy life will belong to all of us.

    荆江蓄洪区说话
    王凤鸣
    编者按：这篇单弦是参加中国人民解放军“八一”建军节体育运动大会文艺竞赛节目之一。作者王凤鸣是人民解放军第四野战军某部曾立四次大功，一次小功，得到“艰苦奋斗”奖章和“勇敢”奖章、并荣获“人民功臣”光荣称号的英雄。王凤鸣是辽东海城人，木工出身。他只上过两三年学。一九四八年参军后经常说快板，以后又练习创作，配合连队教育工作编了十几个剧本。“荆江蓄洪区说话”是他的优秀作品之一。本刊发表时因篇幅关系节略了一段。
    荆江的水，卷着浪花。为安全分洪建闸，千年的洪水灾害连根拔，蓄洪区高兴地也说了话。
    （太平年调）
    （白）它说我呀！
    （唱）叫蓄洪区，真是肚量大；人民高兴地把我夸。住在湖北湖南两交界，生长在毛泽东时代的新国家。
    我很早以前就想要出世，恨只恨那时的社会太腐化；反动政府都是混蛋，从来就不打算建设，它专门会扒。
    长江的水冲出了三峡，流到了荆江一带实在凶煞。流又急来浪又大，偏偏那荆江的河道弯曲又窄狭。到了雨汛期，洪水往上发，江堤常被那水冲垮，千万亩良田变成汪洋一片，孩子找不到娘，人人都没了家。
    国民党反动派不把人屎拉，那帮小子实在该杀，利用修堤的名义，光说不做，到处把油刮。把钱财骗到手，吃喝嫖赌花。要是修堤，他舍不得往外拿。老百姓受灾受害，他们不管，瞪着两个眼睛，他硬装瞎。
    （云苏调）
    幸亏来了共产党，人民翻身当了家，工人阶级来领导，毛主席英明有办法。消除水患兴水利，号召分洪修水闸。因此我才出了世，在社会上服务为大家。我生来好静不好动，不想走来也不想爬。浑身上下长得非常坚固；钢骨铁筋的脑袋瓜，铁板的嘴唇，洋灰的下巴；为讲卫生图省事，我没留头发。
    我的嘴有五十四个喉咙眼，是一个近代化的大水闸。引水堤那是我的两根大龙须；防浪林、护堤石，那就是我的盔甲。头在湖北太平口，脚伸到湖南省黄山底下。要问我到底有多么大，看一看人民日报你就知道啦。
    （金钱莲花落调）
    我镇守荆江威风大，名贯全球传遍天下。国际友人也来参观过我，来自亚洲和太平洋的各个国家。他们来的日子我可记不准，大概是没过六月十八。他们先到黄山头去了一趟，看了看我的尾巴——就是那个节制闸。随后又来到太平口，参观了一下我的脑袋瓜。
    他们说是：这个闸要是放到资本主义国家，给它个十年八年也完不成它。
    他们又说：只有中华人民共和国，真是说到那就做到那。看到了你们的力量这样强大，使我们和平的信心更增加。我听了这些话乐得开了花，乐得我把嘴张开多大，合不上牙。
    （山东快书）
    我感到祖国真是伟大，两个多月的时间就完成计划。这都是，毛主席领导有办法；还有那，各界人民踊跃参加。苏联老大哥也很关心，派来了布可夫同志水利专家。工农兵群众更是没比，个顶个热朝天劲头大。工人去安那大水闸，农民挑土把泥挖。还有咱人民解放军，那里有困难那里有他，不分那白天黑夜、天晴、下雨、大风刮。好像是上了战场，冲锋陷阵把敌杀。这真是群众的力量能移山，就是那江湖河海也能叫它搬家。伟大的任务提前完成，又在我的头上修了个落成纪念塔。我好比独角大王一只兽，爬在江沿上来观察。洪水不来我就休息，洪水来了我就呲牙。张开我的进洪口，一口就把它吞下，好比是口渴了喝香茶，喝它个几十亿吨也不算啥。吃饱喝得了，把嘴一闭，再一点一点地往洞庭湖里头拉。假若是洞庭湖里装不下，不要紧，我屁股上还有个节制闸。把它关上就没事，保险一点也不差。老乡们只管安心生产吧，从今后，再不用提心吊胆、担惊受怕、四面逃荒乱搬家。我并不是说可以麻痹大意不警惕，更应该积极防洪把油加。这才是治水的刚开始，把水害完全变成水利才算彻底征服了它。人民的生活永远有保障，万里平康一片好庄稼。国家的建设更发达，叫祖国早点走向工业化，向着那共产主义社会大步前进，那时候，幸福的生活属于我们大家。
