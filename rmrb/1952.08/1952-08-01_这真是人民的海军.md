"This is truly the People's Navy"

	In May, the season for large yellow croaker arrived on the seas of Zhoushan. To protect the production of the vast number of fishermen and prevent harassment by the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the People's Navy patrolled the fishing grounds day and night. On May 20th, as our patrol gunboat sailed to the waters off Yang'an, we spotted a sailboat with its sail lowered, drifting with the wind to our left front. The soldiers guessed: there must have been an accident with this fishing boat, because during the fishing season, fishing boats rarely sail alone. We quickly sailed towards the sailboat.

	This fishing boat belonged to the Sixth Village of Daizhong District, Gaoting County, Dinghai. The fishermen had discovered a large shark near the Zhongshan Islands. Eight people spent an entire day, risking their lives, to finally catch it. It was estimated that this large shark weighed about 12,000 catties and was worth more than 50 shi of rice. The fishermen, carrying the fish, happily headed back. However, the boat was too small and the fish was too big. Tying the heavy shark to the stern of the boat, it took them a night and a morning to drag it for fifteen nautical miles. Just then, a northwest wind suddenly rose on the sea. The fishermen originally wanted to anchor at Mount Putuo, waiting for the wind to change direction before sailing. However, the northwest wind did not stop, and the large shark and the small sailboat were blown to the southeast sea instead. The fishermen were extremely anxious and could not think of a good solution. Throwing the fish away would not only mean that the labor of eight people for more than a day was wasted, but they would also lose a net. Drifting with the wind would soon take them to Yushan, occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Just as they were in a critical situation, our gunboat arrived. The fishermen were so happy that they could hardly express it.

	The political instructor and the captain understood the situation and decided to use Gunboat No. 4 to tow the fish and Gunboat No. 2 to tow the boat, sending them back to the harbor. The comrades immediately jumped into the water to organize the cables. This was during high tide, and the tidal waves were like mountain peaks, making it difficult for everyone to even open their eyes. However, to protect the interests of the fishermen, the comrades worked tirelessly and finally tied the shark securely with thick cables.

	The fishermen had not eaten for a day and a night, and the comrades quickly invited them to eat. Many comrades, fearing that the fishermen would get cold, took off their coats and put them on them. The fishermen were so grateful to see the comrades caring for them in this way that they were moved to tears.

	The gunboat towed the fishing boat to the harbor, and everyone helped the fishermen carry the big fish to the fish market. To show their appreciation, the fishermen insisted on giving the comrades a large basket of yellow croaker. The comrades politely declined. The fishermen then wrote down the names of the two gunboats and the names of the captain and the political instructor. They said gratefully, "This is truly the People's Navy!"

    “这真是人民的海军”
    五月，舟山海面上大黄花鱼汛期来到了。人民海军为了保护广大渔民生产，防止蒋匪残余侵扰，不分昼夜地在渔场周围巡逻。五月二十日，我们的巡逻炮艇开到佯鞍海面时，发现左前方有一只落了篷的帆船，正在随风漂荡。战士们猜测：这只渔船一定是发生了事故，因为在渔汛期，渔船很少是孤独航行的。我们连忙向帆船驶去。
    这只渔船是定海县高亭区岱中第六村的。渔民们在中山列岛附近发现了一条大鲨鱼，八个人费了一个整天的时间，冒着生命的危险，终于把它捕获了。估计这条大鲨鱼约有一万二千斤重，可值五十多石大米。渔民们带着鱼，高高兴兴地往回走。可是船太小，鱼太大，把笨重的鲨鱼系在船尾上，费了一夜和一个上午，才拖了十五海里。就在这个时候，海面上忽然刮起西北风来了。渔民们本想在普陀山抛锚，等着风向变了，然后开船。可是西北风一直不停，大鲨鱼和小帆船，反倒被风吹到东南海面去了。渔民们焦急万分，想不出好办法。把鱼扔掉吧！不只八个人一天多的劳动算白费了，而且还要赔上一张网。随风漂流吧，很快就要漂到蒋匪盘踞的渔山去了。他们正在十分危急的时候，我们的炮艇赶到了。渔民们高兴得简直无法形容。
    指导员和艇长了解了情况，决定用四号艇拖鱼，二号艇拖船，把他们送回海港。同志们立刻跳下水去整理缆绳。这时正是涨潮时期，潮头像一座一座的山头，把大家打得连眼都睁不开。但是，为了保卫渔民的利益，同志们不辞辛苦，终于用粗大的缆绳把鲨鱼捆牢了。
    渔民们一天一夜没吃饭了，同志们连忙请渔民吃饭。很多同志怕渔民受冻，把身上的大衣脱下来让他们穿上。渔民们看到同志们这样爱护他们，都感激得流泪了。
    炮艇把渔船拖到海港，大家又帮助渔民们把大鱼抬到渔市场。渔民们为了表示心意，一定要送一大篮黄花鱼给同志们。同志们婉言谢绝了。渔民们就把两只炮艇的名字和艇长、指导员的名字记下来。他们感激地说：“这真是人民的海军”！
