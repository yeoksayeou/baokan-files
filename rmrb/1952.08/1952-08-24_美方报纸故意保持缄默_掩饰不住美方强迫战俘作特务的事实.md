Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 22nd: This reporter reports: U.S. newspapers deliberately remain silent to cover up Harrison's failure to accept General Nan Ri's challenge. General Nan Ri's challenge was to ask if Harrison dared to deny that on the list of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war held by the U.S. side, there were a large number of people who were forced to receive spy training in Tokyo and then parachuted into North Korea. After the last plenary meeting, British and American news agencies did not mention this at all, because if this matter were revealed, it would be a devastating blow to Truman's recent remarks. Truman recently said: "We cannot forcibly send prisoners of war back for humanitarian and moral reasons."

General Nan Ri has human and material evidence to prove that Harrison's claim that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war whose names have been deleted from the list have "escaped" is another blatant lie. In fact, these so-called "escaped" prisoners have been forced to serve as U.S. special agents and parachuted down in the skies over northern Korea, and have now been captured by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Harrison, who has been talking about "not using bayonets to forcibly repatriate anyone" for weeks, dares not deny that the U.S. side blatantly violated the Geneva Convention, tortured Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, and used bayonets to threaten to tattoo them, so that they could become tools of the U.S. intelligence agencies.

The U.S. news blockade explains the secret of Harrison's recent shameless remarks to reporters; Harrison said: "We don't have as many prisoners as they want us to repatriate - specifically, they want us to repatriate 20,000 Chinese prisoners." Where did these people disappear to? Well-known facts provide the answer, and these facts show that Harrison and Truman are big liars and big hypocrites who use the high-sounding tune of "humanitarian and moral reasons" to cover up the fact that they are forcibly detaining Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war.

Thousands of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war have been tortured, tattooed, tormented, and killed because they refused to work for U.S. intelligence agencies or because they insisted on going home. The U.S. side transported a large number of Kuomintang bandit instructors from Taiwan to Geoje Island to help them do this dirty work.

At least five Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who Harrison said had "escaped" were personally forced to become special agents and later parachuted into North Korea as witnesses. They are now with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and their personal experiences expose the lies of Harrison and Truman that prisoners of war are not being sent back to their country for so-called "humanitarian and moral reasons."

In addition, there is human evidence to prove that at least five Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war on Geoje Island had their hands and feet cut off and their internal organs removed for experimentation. Their graves, as well as the hundreds of graves on the island, are silent proof of the American massacre of prisoners of war.

Dodd and Colson, the U.S. camp commanders on Geoje Island, admitted in May that "there had been bloodshed, resulting in many prisoners of war being killed or injured by the United Nations forces," and that they had "forcibly screened prisoners of war." This situation was revealed in a statement issued by Clark in Tokyo.

According to U.S. sources alone, after Boatner succeeded Dodd and Colson as the commander of the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp, more than 800 of our prisoners of war were killed or injured in order to forcibly carry out "screening" and intimidate them to give up their right to return home. Despite protests from the Korean-Chinese side, the U.S. representative has so far failed to make any responsible explanation for the massacre of prisoners of war on Geoje Island and the mainland.

Obviously, Truman and the U.S. State Department think that the world has forgotten the bloody events on Geoje Island, and they can now talk about the "humanitarian and moral reasons" that are strangling the hope of a Korean armistice. However, Truman's invitation for neutral countries to investigate Geoje Island was rejected, which is still fresh in the minds of all those who want peace in Korea. The cruelty and shamelessness of the Geoje Island massacre are so unprecedented that no country with national integrity dares to cover up such bloody crimes committed in the name of "non-forcible repatriation," which is actually the detention of prisoners of war.

No matter what hypocritical nonsense Truman and Harrison say, the fact is that the U.S. Air Force is bombing civilians in northern Korea, killing and injuring thousands of Korean women and children in Pyongyang, completely disregarding the Geneva Convention. The U.S. side does not comply with the provisions of the draft armistice agreement that have been agreed upon, and refuses to let all prisoners of war go home, and they are trying to undermine the armistice negotiations that have been going on for nearly fourteen months.

### 美方报纸故意保持缄默  掩饰不住美方强迫战俘作特务的事实

    美方报纸故意保持缄默
    掩饰不住美方强迫战俘作特务的事实
    【新华社开城二十二日电】本社记者报道：美方报纸故意保持缄默，以掩饰哈利逊之未能接受南日将军的挑战。南日将军的挑战是问哈利逊敢不敢否认美方所拘的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的名单上，有大批的人在被迫到东京受间谍训练后空降到北朝鲜境内。美英通讯社在上次全体会议后，对这一点只字不提，因为这件事情如果透露，对杜鲁门最近的谈话，将是一个击中要害的打击。杜鲁门最近说：“我们为了人道和道义的理由不能把战俘强迫送回去。”
    南日将军掌握有人证物证，足以证明哈利逊所谓战俘名单上删去名字的中国人民志愿军被俘人员已经“逃亡”一说又是一个漫天大谎。其实这些所谓“逃亡”的俘虏已被迫充当美国特务在朝鲜北部的天空中空投下来，而且现在已被中国人民志愿军俘获。几星期来一直大谈其“不用刺刀强迫遣返任何一个人”的哈利逊，不敢否认美方曾明目张胆地破坏日内瓦公约，拷打中国人民志愿军被俘人员，用刺刀威胁着在他们身上刺字，以使他们成为美国情报机关的工具。
    美国的新闻封锁说明了哈利逊最近对记者发表的厚颜无耻的谈话的秘密；哈利逊说：“我们没有他们要我们遣返的那么许多俘虏——具体地说，他们要我们遣返两万中国俘虏。”这些人消失到什么地方去了呢？众所周知的事实提供了答复，这些事实表明哈利逊和杜鲁门是大骗子和大伪善家，他们用“人道和道义的理由”的高调来掩盖强迫扣留朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员的事实。
    成千的中国人民志愿军被俘人员遭到拷打、刺字、折磨和屠杀，因为他们拒绝替美国情报机关当特务，或者因为他们坚持要回家。美方从台湾运了大批国民党匪帮的教官到巨济岛去帮同干这件肮脏的事情。
    至少有五个据哈利逊说已经“逃跑”的中国人民志愿军被俘人员是亲身被迫当特务、后来被空降到北朝鲜去的人证。他们现在和中国人民志愿军在一起，他们的亲身经历揭露了哈利逊和杜鲁门所说的战俘由于所谓“人道和道义的理由”不把他们遣送回国的谎言。
    此外还有人证足以证明在巨济岛上至少有五个中国人民志愿军被俘人员曾被割去手足，挖去内脏，供实验之用。他们的坟墓以及岛上的好几百个坟墓就是美国残杀战俘的沉默的证明。
    巨济岛上的美方战俘营长官杜德和柯尔生在五月间曾供认“有过流血事件发生，结果有许多战俘被联合国军队打死或打伤”，并曾“对战俘进行强迫甄别”。这种情况是克拉克在东京发表的声明中透露的。
    仅仅根据美国的消息，在波纳继杜德、柯尔生之后担任巨济岛俘虏营长官后，就有八百多个我方被俘人员被杀死或打伤，以强迫进行“甄别”，并恫吓他们要他们放弃回家的权利。尽管朝中方面提出抗议，美方代表迄今一直没有对在巨济岛和大陆上屠杀战俘的事件作任何负责的交代。
    显然，杜鲁门和美国国务院以为世界已经忘记了巨济岛血腥事件，他们现在可以大谈其扼杀朝鲜停战的希望的“人道和道义的理由”了。但是，杜鲁门要求中立国家到巨济岛调查的邀请之遭受拒绝，在所有要求在朝鲜实现和平的人们的脑海里记忆犹新。巨济岛屠杀事件的残忍和无耻是如此史无前例，任何一个有国格的国家都不敢为这种在“不强迫遣返”实际是扣留战俘的名义下所干的血腥罪行进行掩饰。
    不管杜鲁门和哈利逊说些什么伪善的鬼话，事实是：美国空军正在轰炸朝鲜北部的平民，在平壤炸死和炸伤了成千的朝鲜妇女和儿童，完全藐视日内瓦公约。美方不遵守停战协定草案中业经协议各款的规定，拒绝让全体战俘回家，他们就企图这样来破坏进行了近十四个月的停战谈判。
