    Seven. One day, while herding pigs near the school entrance, I remembered the kind Teacher Zhou and decided to go in and see him. As soon as I entered the school, the local tyrant Baozhang came and beat me severely with his cane, cursing, "You eat from my bowl, so you have to listen to me… If I see you playing here again, I'll break your legs!"
    Eight. When I was nine years old, my family could not make ends meet, so I went with my father to Dalian, where I studied for seven days, then did odd jobs and learned carpentry... I never studied again.
    Nine. I have loved listening to stories since I was a child. In Dalian, in front of my uncle's house, there was a storyteller who told stories of the Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, and Song Dynasties. I would stand and listen until midnight without feeling tired.

    七、有一天我放猪放到学校门口，想起了好心的周老师，就决定进去看看他。我才进了学校，阎王保长来了，用文明棍狠狠地打我，骂我：“你端我的碗，就得受我管……我再看你到这里来玩，把你腿给打断！”
    八、我九岁那年，家里生活无法维持，我就跟父亲到大连，在那里读了七天书，便做零工、学木匠……再也没念过书。
    九、我从小喜欢听故事。在大连，我叔叔家门前有一个说书的，说的是隋唐五代和大宋的故事，晚上我站着听到半夜也不觉得累。
