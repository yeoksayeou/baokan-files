    Editor: With your introduction and help, on the afternoon of the 13th, we held a pleasant and exciting joint celebration with the soldiers of a certain company of the People's Liberation Army.
    Long ago, when we saw the news in the newspaper that the students of the Affiliated Girls' Middle School of Beijing Normal University were helping the soldiers carry out recreational activities, everyone unanimously requested to have a joint celebration with the soldiers, to play collective games and dance group dances with them. After the People's Daily introduced us and contacted the relevant departments, on the 13th, despite the fatigue after listening to the report in the morning, we braved the rain to reach the camp. We were warmly welcomed and entertained by the soldiers. The leaders of the company headquarters told us that the soldiers were very happy to hear that we were going to have a joint celebration, and they had all learned the song scores of the collective dance we were going to teach them, waiting for us. This further increased and encouraged the emotions of every student. However, the rain kept falling, and we couldn't play in the yard, so we had to divide into groups and go to each class, chatting, singing, and playing games with the soldiers in their rooms. The soldiers talked about their cultural studies, telling us how to overcome difficulties in learning, how to promote the spirit of mutual assistance, and also talked about the benefits of dancing and singing for a while after being tired from studying. These deeply moved us and made us want to actively help the soldiers carry out recreational activities. Enthusiastic singing and laughter filled every room. The students and soldiers intimately started playing games together. Later, we performed the prepared programs for the soldiers. Before the program was finished, the soldiers had to start their cultural studies, and everyone had to reluctantly part ways.
    After returning to school, the students discussed how to learn from the soldiers' spirit of overcoming difficulties. Everyone said that because of the bad weather, the prepared group dance and other games could not be held. Next time, we will take advantage of a good weather day to have a joint celebration with the soldiers and teach them everything we have learned and know.
    All students of Class 27, Beijing Russian Language School

### 北京俄文专修学校同学和战士联欢

    北京俄文专修学校同学和战士联欢
    编辑同志：在你们的介绍和帮助下，十三日下午，我们与解放军某连队的战士们愉快地兴奋地在一块举行了一次联欢会。
    很早以前，当我们在报纸上看到北京师范大学附属女子中学的同学帮助战士们开展文娱活动的消息后，大家就一致要求和战士们开联欢会、和战士们一起做集体游戏、跳集体舞。经过人民日报介绍和有关部门联系后，十三日，我们不顾上午听报告后的疲倦，冒雨到达营地，我们受到战士们热情的欢迎和招待，连部的首长告诉我们，战士们听见我们要去联欢，非常高兴，都学会了我们准备教他们跳的集体舞的歌谱子等待着我们，这更增加和鼓舞了每个同学的情绪。但是雨老是不停，院子里不能玩，我们只好分成小组到各班，在战士们的房里和他们聊天、唱歌、游戏。战士们谈到了他们学文化的情况，告诉我们怎样克服学习上的困难，怎样发挥互助精神，又谈到在学习疲倦后，跳一会儿舞，又唱一会儿歌对他们学习的好处。这些深深地感动了我们，使我们更想积极帮助战士们开展文娱活动了。每个屋子里响起了热情的歌声和笑声。同学们、战士们亲热地在一块开始游戏。后来，我们又给战士们表演了准备好的节目。节目还未演完，战士们要开始文化学习，大家才不得不依依不舍地分手。
    回到学校以后，同学们谈论起怎样学习战士们克服困难的精神，大家都说，这次由于天气不好，准备好的集体舞和其他的游戏都没能举行，下次再抽一个好天气的日子去和战士们联欢，把我们学会的，所知道的都教给战士们。
