A Brief Review of Political and Legal Work

Why did the Hebei Provincial People's Court Wrongfully Judge the Zheng Luoquan and Others False Accusation Case?

The Hebei Provincial People's Court's erroneous conviction of Zheng Luoquan and five others for "murder," causing revolutionary cadres and activists to suffer unjust grievances for a long time, is a painful lesson. Why did the Hebei Provincial People's Court wrongfully judge this case? The main reason is that some trial personnel and leaders in the court had unclear class standpoints and were infected with serious old judicial styles, which led to major errors in their viewpoints and methods. The prominent manifestation was listening to only one side and making subjective assumptions. They unilaterally believed that the plaintiff was a revolutionary cadre for many years and superficially saw that the alleged facts had some basis and the evidence was solid, thus developing a preconceived notion that Zheng Luoquan must be a counter-revolutionary element. Under the dominance of this preconceived notion, their subsequent investigation was merely to find evidence for the conclusion that had already been made. Even the opinions of landlords, rich peasants, and reactionary secret societies were accepted as strong materials and firmly believed as long as they fit their own conclusions. On the other hand, the opposing materials, regardless of whether they came from many party members, cadres, and the broad masses, were all considered "biased" and "protecting" the defendant, the result of the defendant "luring the masses" and "conspiring." Their trial was extremely undemocratic and unserious: in the entire file of tens of thousands of words, except for the plaintiff's accusations, there were no cross-examination statements and records of the defendant's rebuttal reasons. Only close questioning in the courtroom was seen, forcing the defendant to find materials consistent with the plaintiff's accusations, while the defendant's rebuttals were not objectively analyzed at all, but arbitrarily considered "cunning" and "denying."

Secondly, the Hebei Provincial People's Court completely ignored the relevant historical facts in handling this case, and only examined individual facts in isolation, which was also a mistake. The crimes Zheng Luoquan was accused of were "plotting murder, arresting and killing anti-Japanese cadres, assassinating family members of martyrs, extorting money and property from the people, raping women, killing people to marry concubines, organizing gangster spies into assassination groups, and the masses hated him to the bone, demanding that the government impose the death penalty." This should obviously be regarded as a counter-revolutionary case. Whether Zheng Luoquan was a counter-revolutionary element should be regarded as the basic key to the problem. To clarify this point, it is necessary to examine the entire history, not just a few points accused by Zheng Yi in isolation. However, the Hebei Provincial People's Court did the opposite. They completely adopted the erroneous method of accusing and saying only that point. The Hebei Provincial People's Court was not completely unaware of Zheng Luoquan's merits in protecting our anti-Japanese personnel when he was the village chief of Yingdi Village, rescuing our personnel who were captured by the enemy several times, and often sheltering anti-Japanese cadres in the village; however, when dealing with the Zheng Luoquan case, they completely did not consider these circumstances, did not analyze and judge whether Zheng Luoquan was a revolutionary cadre or a counter-revolutionary element, and simply affirmed the facts accused by Zheng Yi.

Thirdly, the ultra-class viewpoint in observing problems, not looking at problems from the essence of class. They only saw that Zheng Yi's family was inclined to resist Japan, but they completely disregarded their family's failure to implement the semi-real wage system, their exploitation and abuse of hired laborers, and their opposition to Zheng Luoquan's implementation of the "unified progressive tax," considering it only as "stubbornness" and "unwillingness to suffer losses" of ordinary farmers. Zheng Yi did not hesitate to absorb landlords and rich peasants when he collected materials of "the masses" opposing Zheng Luoquan in order to frame him, but such a serious fact was not valued! It seemed that as long as Zheng Yi's family had been reclassified as a well-to-do middle peasant component, the class nature of his stance and actions could be completely ignored.

The Hebei Provincial People's Court's handling of the problems that occurred in the land reform movement also showed great deviations. Zheng Yi's family was classified as a rich peasant, which was determined by the work team and the masses at the time; and because Zheng Yi's family had hired long-term laborers before and after the War of Resistance Against Japan, and had exploited and abused hired laborers, the masses could not clearly calculate the proportion of exploitation income, and it was easy to confuse them with rich peasants. This was not an isolated phenomenon at the time. The death of Zheng Yi's brother, Zheng Shenghua, from being beaten, was also not an isolated phenomenon. In the vigorous land reform movement at that time, in the sharp struggle, it was also difficult to completely avoid this phenomenon. Such problems must be handled in accordance with the spirit of the entire policy of dealing with the problems left over from the people within the land reform; however, the Hebei Provincial People's Court abandoned the historical situation at that time and singled out individual problems to settle old scores, arbitrarily believing that it was "plotting murder," and the result of doing so would inevitably arouse the opposition of the broad masses.

Although this case has gone through many twists and turns, it was finally handled correctly. In addition to giving the deserved punishment to Zheng Yi himself for harboring resentment and making false accusations, appropriate punishments were also given for the errors of the Hebei Provincial People's Court, and necessary follow-up work was carried out. This approach is completely correct. In order to deeply learn from the lessons of this event, it is very necessary for the Hebei Provincial People's Court to conduct a serious and systematic review.

### 河北省人民法院为什么错判了郑洛权等被诬告案

    河北省人民法院为什么错判了郑洛权等被诬告案
    河北省人民法院错判郑洛权等六人“杀人罪”，使革命干部和积极分子长期蒙受不白之冤，这是一个沉痛的教训。河北省人民法院为什么会错判了这一案件呢？主要的原因，是法院中的某些审判人员和负责人阶级立场不明确，传染了严重的旧司法作风，使他们在观点上和方法上都发生了很大的错误。突出的表现，是偏听偏信，主观臆断。他们片面地根据原告是多年的革命干部，表面地看到所告事实有根有苗，证据确凿，因此就产生了郑洛权必是反革命分子的成见。在这种成见的支配下，他们后来所进行的调查只不过是给已经做好的结论寻找证据。甚至连地主、富农和反动会道门分子的舆论，也是只要适合自己的结论，就当成有力材料，深信不疑。而反面的材料，则不管是来自许多党员、干部和广大的基本群众，也一概认为是“偏袒”、“包庇”被告，是被告“拉拢群众”和“串供”的结果。他们的审判极不民主，极不认真：在全卷不下数万言的笔录中，除原告的控词外，竟找不到对于被告所提出的反驳理由的对证口供和笔录。只看见法庭上的穷追逼问，硬要在被告方面找出与原告控词相符的材料，而对被告提出的反驳则完全不作客观的分析，只是武断地认为“狡猾”、“抵赖”。
    其次，河北省人民法院在处理这一案件中，对于有关的历史事实完全不顾，只是孤立地考查个别事实，这种方法也是错误的。郑洛权被控的罪名是
    “阴谋杀人，捕杀抗日干部，暗杀抗属，讹诈民财，强奸民女，杀人娶妾，组织流氓特务结为暗杀集团，群众恨入骨髓，要求政府处以极刑”。这显然是应该当作反革命案件去看的。郑洛权是不是反革命分子，应该看作问题的基本关键。而要弄清这点，就必须考察全部历史，而不应孤立考察郑义所控告的几点。但河北省人民法院恰恰相反。他们完全采取了告那一点说那一点的错误方法。郑洛权在任应敌村长时保护我方抗日人员过境、几次营救我方被敌抓去的人员、经常在村里掩护抗日干部等功绩，河北省人民法院并不是完全不知道；但在处理郑洛权案时却完全不把这些情况估计进去，对郑洛权究竟是革命干部还是反革命分子也不做分析判断，就孤立地肯定了郑义所控告的事实。
    再次，是观察问题上的超阶级观点，不从阶级本质上看问题。他们只看到郑义的家庭是倾向抗日的家庭，而对他家不实行半实物工资制、剥削和虐待雇工，反对郑洛权贯彻“统一累进税”等明显的地主、富农立场，完全不加考虑，认为只是一般农民的“死把”（意指固执）和“不愿吃亏”。郑义为陷害郑洛权而到处搜罗“群众”反对郑洛权的材料时，不惜吸收地主、富农参加，这样严重的事实竟都不被重视！好像只要郑义的家庭已经改订成富裕中农成份，其所站的立场及所作所为的阶级性质就可以完全不问了。
    河北省人民法院对于土地改革运动中所发生的问题的处理，也同样表现了很大偏差。郑义家被划为富农，当时是由工作组和群众讨论划定的；而且因为郑义家在抗战前后雇过长工，有过剥削和虐待雇工的行为，群众计算不清剥削收入的比重，是很容易与富农混淆的。这在当时并非个别现象。郑义之兄郑生华被打伤致死，也不是个别现象。在当时轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动中，在尖锐的斗争中，也是难于完全避免的现象。这种问题，必须根据对待土地改革中人民内部积留问题的整个政策的精神去处理；而河北省人民法院却抛开当时历史情况，单独把个别问题提出来算旧账，武断地认为“阴谋杀人”，这样做的结果，必然是激起广大群众的反对。
    这个案件虽然经过许多曲折，但最后终于得到了正确的处理。除对挟嫌诬告的郑义本人给了应得的惩处外，对河北省人民法院的错误也作了适当的处分，并进行了必要的善后工作。这种作法是完全正确的。为了深刻地接受这一事件的教训，认真地系统地进行一次检讨对于河北省人民法院是十分必要的。
