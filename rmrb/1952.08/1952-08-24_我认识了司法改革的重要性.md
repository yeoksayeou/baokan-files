    I Recognize the Importance of Judicial Reform
    Comrade Editor: After reading the news published in the People's Daily for several days concerning the nationwide judicial reform movement and the revealed facts, I deeply recognize the importance of building a people's judiciary and the significance of carrying out the judicial reform movement.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people have seized their own political power, but there are still counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the people's judicial organs and hold important positions, directly endangering the people and undermining revolutionary order. This is intolerable to the people of the whole country! This judicial reform movement, launched nationwide, will not only purge these counter-revolutionaries from the people's judicial organs, but also thoroughly eliminate old legal viewpoints and carry out ideological remolding in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. Therefore, this is not only a reform in the judicial field, but also a fierce ideological and political struggle waged by the people of the whole country to consolidate their own political power. Therefore, we should participate in this movement with the attitude and enthusiasm of masters, conduct in-depth propaganda among the masses, so that the broad masses can recognize the serious harm brought to the people by old legal viewpoints, and expose the facts of illegal and undisciplined behavior of judicial personnel, in order to promote the development of the movement.
    In the past, judicial work was relatively neglected. Some people were unwilling to do judicial work. Through this movement, we should deeply criticize this kind of thinking, so that everyone has a correct understanding of the seriousness of judicial work and its great political significance.　　An Ruixia

    我认识了司法改革的重要性
    编辑同志：看到人民日报连日刊载的有关全国司法改革运动的消息和揭发出来的一些事实，我深刻认识到人民司法建设的重要性和进行司法改革运动的意义。
    在共产党领导下，人民掌握了自己的政权，但在人民司法机关却还有反革命分子混入，并担任重要职务，直接危害人民，破坏革命秩序。这是全国人民不能容忍的！这次在全国范围内展开的司法改革运动，不仅要在人民司法机关中清洗这些反革命分子，更要彻底肃清旧法观点，进行一次思想改造，以巩固人民民主专政。所以这不仅是司法界的一次改革，而且是全国人民为巩固自己政权而进行的一次激烈的思想和政治斗争。因此，我们应该以主人翁的态度和热情参加这一运动，深入群众进行宣传，使广大群众都认识到旧法观点给人民带来的严重危害，揭发司法人员的违法乱纪的事实，以推动运动的开展。
    过去，司法工作是比较不受人重视的。有些人不愿作司法工作。通过这次运动，应深刻批判这种思想，使每个人对司法工作的严肃性和它重大的政治意义都有正确的认识。　　安瑞霞
