Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 8th: Our country's basketball team, attending the 15th International Olympic Games, at the invitation of Finnish progressives, went to Tampere, the third largest city in Finland, on the 6th to conduct a friendly match with the local workers' basketball team. This match was a very lively event in the city's history. Due to the rain that day, many residents wore raincoats or held umbrellas to watch the game at the stadium. Among them were old women with canes. Many people stood far away to watch because they could not squeeze into the stadium. Due to the wet field, the players on both sides could not fully demonstrate their skills, but their performance was still very exciting, repeatedly winning enthusiastic applause from the audience. As a result of the match, our country's basketball team won with a score of 46 to 24.

The members of our country's basketball team received a warm welcome from the local people in Tampere. When they had not yet arrived at the station, many welcomers were waiting at the station in the rain. The welcomers took them to rest in the workers' hotel, which the workers themselves had built in their spare time to use as a club. Our players were invited to visit the place where Lenin and Stalin first met in 1918. This place has been turned into a museum, and an old man who manages the museum enthusiastically told everyone about the meeting of these two revolutionary mentors, and guided everyone to visit the furniture used by Lenin during his exile in Finland, which is displayed in the museum.

When our team left Tampere, many people surrounded the team's car and bid them farewell enthusiastically. An old lady even tried to squeeze out of the crowd to see them off. Our players were deeply moved.

Our basketball team also held a match with the Finnish national basketball champion team in Helsinki on the 4th. Our football team visited Turku, the second largest city in Finland, and competed with the local football team, also receiving a warm welcome.

    我国出席奥林匹克运动会球队
    在芬兰各地比赛受到热烈欢迎
    【新华社赫尔辛基八日电】我国出席第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的篮球队，应芬兰进步人士的邀请，在六日赴芬兰第三大城市坦培累，和当地工人篮球队进行了友谊比赛。这次比赛在该城历史上是很热闹的一次，由于当天下雨，许多居民就穿着雨衣或撑着雨伞到运动场看比赛，其中还有拄着拐杖的老妇人。有许多人因为不能挤进运动场就站在老远的地方观看。由于场地潮湿，双方球员虽无法大显身手，但是他们的表演仍然很精彩，屡屡博得观众的热烈掌声。比赛结果，我国篮球队以四十六比二十四获胜。
    我国篮球队员在坦培累受到了当地人民的热烈欢迎。当他们还未到达车站时，许多欢迎者就冒着雨在站上迎候。欢迎者把他们送到工人们自己在业余时间修建起来作为俱乐部用的工人饭店中休息。我国球员曾被邀参观了列宁和斯大林一九一八年第一次会面的地方，这个地方已经辟为博物馆，管理这所博物馆的一位老人热情地向大家谈述了这两位革命导师会面的情况，并指引大家参观馆内陈列的列宁在流亡芬兰期间所用过的家具。
    当我国球队离开坦培累时，许多人包围了球队的车子，热情道别，有一位老太太还努力从人丛中挤过来欢送。我国球员深深受到感动。
    我国篮球队在四日还曾与芬兰全国篮球冠军队在赫尔辛基举行了比赛，我国足球队曾访问芬兰第二大城市土尔库和该地足球队进行比赛，也受到热烈的欢迎。
