New China's First Domestically Produced Locomotive "August 1st"
Wu Ling

The entire staff of the Sifang Railway Factory are working hard to build New China's first domestically produced locomotive before "August 1st."

On July 26th, the locomotive was basically completed. In the evening, the square south of the factory's locomotive yard was packed with people, all waiting for news of the test run results. Around 7:30 PM, the people who conducted the test run returned. One of the crew members jumped off the train before it reached the factory and shouted to everyone: "It runs very well!" Warm applause and cheers of "We have won!" resounded from the train and below. The driver said triumphantly: "It runs very smoothly. On the way back, we ran at a speed of seventy-two to seventy-five kilometers per hour, and the train was still not jumping or swaying. If an ordinary train ran like that, people probably wouldn't be able to stand on the water tank!" During the test run, they constantly measured the temperature of the axles, and the temperature of the main axle was only 55 degrees Celsius (according to regulations, it should be below 70 degrees). Factory Director Liu Wei said excitedly: "This is the result of all the employees paying attention to improving quality and technology after our 'quality make-up lesson.'"

This is a brand-new ㄇㄎ一 (MK1) type locomotive. It has a powerful traction force and can drive trains carrying more than 3,000 tons of goods at high speed. Strict inspection and test runs have proven that the quality of this new locomotive has reached the required standards. Because every worker cares about its quality with a sense of ownership, every part has been finely processed and carefully inspected. In order to make the boiler strong and durable, they adopted advanced electric welding methods, electrically welding all the stay bolts and front and rear tube sheets. They used nodular cast iron (this type of iron is resistant to high pressure and has the properties of steel and ductile cast iron) to manufacture steam towers, ejectors, and other high-pressure bent pipe joints. These parts made of nodular cast iron were tested under a water pressure of 25 kilograms per cubic centimeter without any sweating or leakage. To ensure quality, the factory's technicians and inspectors also put in a lot of effort, often cooperating with the workers on site to improve technology. The workshops also established a "three-check system" (self-inspection, group leader inspection, foreman inspection). "Not letting a single bad piece of work pass!" has become everyone's consciously executed slogan.

The making of this locomotive fully demonstrates the infinite wisdom and creative talent of the working class of New China. In the manufacturing process, difficulties arose constantly, especially since some parts that used to be purchased from imperialist countries now had to be manufactured by themselves. This was an arduous task. When encountering difficulties, the employees often encouraged themselves by learning from the spirit of hard fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteers, so their enthusiasm for labor was very high. The radius link was an important part of the locomotive's traction system, and everyone racked their brains for this piece. At first, some people said: "This thing has always been made by foreigners, we can't make it." After repeated experiments by veteran technician Ding Xuewen, the problem of carburizing the material was solved. But after it was made, it still didn't work. Everyone was very anxious, and later they discovered that the "live block" on the radius link was unsuitable because the curvature was incorrect, the grinding was uneven, and the contact surface was small. This is how the radius link was finally made. Another example is the main accessories of the braking system—the brake operating valve and the independent operating valve—which were also successfully manufactured with the close cooperation of workers and technicians. In practical training, the workers deeply realized that overcoming difficulties means defeating the shameless economic blockade of the imperialists.

The vigorous development of rationalization proposals and the promotion of the Soviet Union's advanced production experience over the past two years have created favorable conditions for the trial production of the locomotive. Since the launch of the patriotic production increase and conservation movement, all production teams in the factory have formulated advanced production plans, and the enthusiasm for labor production has been increasing day by day. The mechanical workshops have widely promoted the high-speed cutting method, and the mechanical processing efficiency has increased by an average of 50%. The Tang Zongyu cylinder casting team in the foundry workshop adopted the Kovalev working method and the assembly line operation method, which reduced the casting of each cylinder from more than 70 work hours to 26 work hours. The locomotive workshop created a car-levering machine and a wind-powered boiler transport machine, which saved a lot of manpower and shortened the time for levering cars and transporting boilers. Thanks to the unity and selfless labor of all employees, the manufacturing man-hours of this locomotive were reduced from 6,000 (department-set plan) to more than 3,600, saving the country more than 280 million yuan in wealth.

The appearance of New China's first domestically produced locomotive shows the superiority of the new democratic political system, and illustrates that under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class has no insurmountable difficulties. Today, the first domestically produced locomotive has appeared in the motherland, and tomorrow more domestically produced locomotives will carry large quantities of materials, galloping on the people's railways.

    新中国第一台国产火车头“八一号”
    吴凌
    四方铁路工厂的全体职工，在“八一”前紧张地赶造新中国第一台国产火车头。
    七月二十六日，这台机车基本上已经完工了。傍晚，该厂机车场南边的广场上挤满了人，都等待着试车结果的消息。将近七点半钟，试车的人们回来了，有一位乘务员不等机车到厂，就跳下车来向大家高呼：“跑得很好！”车上车下响起热烈的掌声，欢呼着“我们胜利了！”司机得意地说：“跑得挺稳，回来时我们跑七十二到七十五公里的速度，车还是不跳不摆。一般的车要是这样跑，水柜上恐怕早就站不住人啦！”他们在试车时不断地量车轴的温度，大轴的温度只有摄氏五十五度（按规定应在七十度以下）。厂长刘伟兴奋地说：“这是我们经过‘质量补课’以后，全体职工都重视了提高质量、提高技术的结果。”
    这是一台崭新的冖丂一型的火车头，它具有强大的牵引力，能带动载有三千吨以上货物的列车快速运转。经过严格的检验和试车证明，这台新火车头的质量已达到了应有的标准。由于每一个工人都以主人翁的态度来关心着它的质量，因此，每一个配件都经过精细加工和缜密的检查。为了使锅炉结实耐用，他们采用了先进的电焊法，电焊了全部螺撐和前后管钣。他们用球墨铸铁（此种铁，耐高压，具有钢和延性铸铁的性质）制造蒸气塔、射水器等高压弯管接头。这些用球墨铸铁制造的部分，经每立方公分二十五公斤水压，并没有冒汗、泄漏的现象。为了保证质量，厂里的技术员、检查员也下了很大功夫，他们经常配合现场的工人，改进技术；车间也建立起“三检制”（本人检查、组长检查、工长检查）。“不让一件坏活混过去！”成为每个人自觉执行的口号。
    这台机车的制成，充分地表现出新中国工人阶级的无穷智慧和创造才能。在制造过程中，困难不断地发生，特别是有些过去一向依靠向帝国主义国家购买的配件，现在都要由自己来制造。这是一个艰巨的任务。当遇到困难的时候，职工们常常以学习中国人民志愿军艰苦战斗的精神来鼓励自己，因此劳动热情十分高涨。月牙板是机车牵引的重要机件，为了这块东西大家费透了心机；开始曾有人说：“这玩艺儿过去向来是外国造的，咱制不得。”经过老技工丁学文多次的试验，才解决了渗碳对料问题。但是做好以后，仍是不行；大家都很着急，后来才发现月牙板上的“活块”因弧度不对，磨得不平，接触面小了，所以不适用。这样，才把月牙板制成。又如制动部分的主要配件——制动司轫阀和独立司轫阀，也在工人和技术人员的密切合作下，制造成功了。在实际的锻炼中，工人们深深地体会到：克服困难，就可以战胜帝国主义者无耻的经济封锁。
    两年多以来合理化建议的蓬勃开展和推广苏联的先进生产经验，为试制机车创造了优越的条件。自开展爱国增产节约运动以来，全厂各生产小组都订出了先进的生产计划，劳动生产的热情日趋高涨。机械车间普遍推广了高速切削法，机械加工效率平均提高百分之五十。翻砂车间唐宗玉汽缸铸造小组采用了郭瓦廖夫工作法和流水作业法，使每个汽缸的铸造由七十多工缩短到二十六工。机车车间创造了撬车机、风力锅炉运送机，节省了许多人工，缩短了撬车和运送锅炉的时间。由于全体职工团结一致和忘我地劳动，使这台机车的制造工时由六千工（部定计划）缩短到三千六百余工，为国家节省了二亿八千多万元的财富。
    新中国第一台国产火车头的出现，显示了新民主主义政治制度的优越性，说明了中国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，没有克服不了的困难。今天在祖国出现了第一台国产火车头，明天将有更多的国产火车头运载着大量的物资，驰骋在人民的铁道上。
