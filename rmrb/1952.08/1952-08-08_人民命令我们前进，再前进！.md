The People Order Us to Advance, Advance Again!
Volunteer Army Air Force Combat Hero Zhao Baotong

When I received the notice to return from the Korean front to the motherland to attend the 25th Anniversary Sports Meeting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army “August 1st” Army Day, my comrades were all happy for me and for the honor of our Volunteer Air Force. Because I could see Beijing, where Chairman Mao lives, and the beloved people of the motherland, and the representatives of all services and arms of the People's Liberation Army participating in the sports meeting. We must return to learn humbly and bring the love of the people of the whole country for the Volunteer Air Force back to the troops.

When our delegation's special train entered the Beijing Railway Station, the representatives of workers, students, and children who welcomed us ran along with the carriages. Young workers and students carried us all the way to the station square outside the platform. The Young Pioneers swarmed up to hug my neck, asking us questions about our well-being, asking if we were tired from fighting, and if we were in good health. Before this, I had flown the plane donated by the people of the motherland to Korea to severely punish those American aerial bandits for the motherland and the Korean people. When I saw the rosy faces of the children we had personally protected, and heard them affectionately call me Uncle Volunteer Army, I understood even more that being a people's soldier is my greatest happiness and glory. They put red scarves around my neck and threw bouquets of flowers into my arms. I understand that these red scarves, these young voices, represent the motherland, ordering me to advance, advance again, to strike the enemy more bravely and ruthlessly, to protect the motherland, protect peace, and protect every young and beautiful life, so that they can study in peace and grow up beautifully.

But at that time, I really couldn't say a word. I could only keep shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great people of the motherland!" The honor belongs to Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland. I am just a member of the people of the motherland, carrying out the will of the people of the motherland. I often ask myself: Who enabled me, a pig-herding child, an ordinary worker, to master modern flight technology? It is the people of the motherland, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao! What gave me a hundredfold courage and infinite strength to severely strike those shameless enemies? It is the Party and Chairman Mao who gave me cultivation and education. I flew the plane donated by the people of the motherland, with the determination to avenge the Korean people, that I created the achievement of shooting down or damaging eight enemy planes in one month. Before this, I heard the report from the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army, knowing that the people of the motherland donated airplanes for us, donating thousands of them at a time. An old Uyghur mother in Xinjiang, over a hundred years old, was still donating the money she earned from collecting firewood every day to the Volunteer Army to buy airplanes. At that time, my wingman Comrade Fan Wanzhang and I couldn't sleep at night after hearing this, always thinking: The people of the motherland are working hard every day, saving every penny to support us, for what? The great actions of the people of the motherland gave me unparalleled strength. I am proud to be a person of the new China, and I am proud of the justice of our war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. I knew that behind me was the power of 500 million people of the motherland supporting me. Not long after this, I set a record of shooting down two enemy planes in one sortie. Then, in one month, I shot down or damaged a total of eight enemy planes. In battle, I had only one belief, which was how I could better and more effectively eliminate the enemy, and use our victory to answer the people of the motherland's ardent expectations for our Volunteer Air Force. I remember once on the way back from the war zone, we saw a group of old crow-like enemy planes strafing the kind and peaceful people of Korea over a small city. When I saw this situation, I became furious. I dove down, aimed at one of them, and blasted it with a few shells. Seeing it fall down smoking, I felt unspeakable joy. But I was not satisfied with this. This was just the beginning of my fight for the people of the motherland and revenge for the Korean people. After I shot down five enemy planes, I felt dizzy once while preparing for battle, and lay dazed under the plane. When the aviation doctor came to me and asked me, a force supported me, making me unwilling to tell the truth, because this was exactly when the people needed me. I insisted on getting on the plane. When I discovered the enemy plane, strong hatred made me violently attack the enemy. The flight speed was too fast, the fuselage was out of control, and I rushed under the enemy plane. I quickly grabbed the control stick with both hands and pulled it up violently, and then I fainted. What force made me sober up, stay calm, and continue to fight? It was the motherland, Chairman Mao, and the people calling me, enabling me to fight powerfully again. I think this is a fundamental reason why our young Volunteer Air Force can defeat the American aerial bandits.

Especially after my combat deeds spread to the motherland, I received a continuous stream of congratulatory letters from every corner of the motherland. In less than a month, I received many congratulatory letters. From Nanjing alone, there were more than a hundred letters. The people who wrote these letters included workers, young students, cadres, shop assistants, and citizens, and even more were the little brothers and sisters who were carrying their schoolbags to school. They sent me their beloved study excellence medals, and the Young Pioneers sent me their most precious red scarves. A primary school student in Nanjing tore off the photo on his study certificate to send to me because he didn't have a photo. Two worker brothers in Siping, Northeast China, drew my combat deeds into picture albums and mailed them to me. Many reading groups wrote letters to me collectively; many Young Pioneers aspired to be air force pilots; many children used their small hands to decorate the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu exquisitely and sent them to me; many teachers told me that they were using my stories to educate students. Model workers told me about their production increase achievements, saying that I had brought glory to the working class of the new China. What particularly moved me was that they told me their most sacred wish—applying to join the Party—and let me be happy with them. Young students told me that they wanted to be our reserve force, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the battle post.

Dear comrades, I did not expect that I only did so little, and the people of the motherland gave me such great honor. I am a soldier, and a soldier loves his honor. But from the bottom of my heart, I feel that what I have done is not commensurate with the honor I have received. Especially this time when I returned to the motherland, I saw the arduous combat paths taken by the glorious People's Liberation Army and many hero models and people's meritorious officials who had been tempered in battle for a long time. Compared to their merits for the people of the motherland, what is my little deed? The people love me and care for me so much, and they have educated me once again: making me love the motherland and the people a hundredfold more. I can only strike the enemy better and more to answer the people's love for me. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached photo)

    人民命令我们前进，再前进！
    志愿军空军战斗英雄  赵宝桐
    当我接到通知，要我从朝鲜前线回到祖国，来参观中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会的时候，同志们都为我、为我们志愿空军的荣誉而高兴。因为我可以看到毛主席所住着的地方——北京，看到亲爱的祖国人民和参加运动大会的人民解放军各兵种的代表。我们回来要虚心学习，并把全国人民对志愿空军的热爱带回部队中去。
    当我们代表团的专车进入北京车站的时候，欢迎我们的工人、学生和儿童的代表跟着车厢跑。青年工人、学生把我们一直抬到月台外面的车站广场上。少年儿童队员们一直拥上来搂住我的脖子，向我们问长问短，问我们作战辛苦了，身体健康不。在这以前，我驾着祖国人民所捐献的飞机，去到朝鲜为祖国和朝鲜人民重重地惩罚了那些美国空中强盗。当我看到经我们亲手保卫着的儿童红红的脸，听到他们亲切地叫我志愿军叔叔的时候，我就更加明白了，作为一个人民战士真是我最大的幸福和光荣。他们把一个个红领巾扣在我脖子上，把一束束鲜花丢到我怀里。我明白这些红领巾，这些年青的声音正是代表祖国，命令我前进，再前进，要更英勇，更无情地打击敌人，奋不顾身来保卫祖国、保卫和平、保卫每一个年青美丽的生命，让他们安心学习，美好地成长起来。
    但是当时我真是说不出一句话来，我只能不住地喊出：“毛主席万岁！”“伟大的祖国人民万岁！”荣誉是属于毛主席、属于祖国人民的。我不过是祖国人民的一分子，执行了祖国人民的意志。我常常问我自己：是谁，使我一个放猪的孩子，一个普通的工人能够掌握现代化的飞行技术呢？是祖国人民，是中国共产党和毛主席！是什么使我有百倍的勇气和无限的力量来狠狠打击那些无耻的敌人呢？是党、是毛主席给我的培养教育。我驾驶的是祖国人民捐献的飞机，抱着为朝鲜人民复仇的决心，才创造了一个月打落、打伤敌机八架的成绩。在这以前，我听到志愿军归国代表的传达报告，知道祖国人民为我们捐献飞机，一捐就是几千架。新疆维吾尔族有一个一百多岁的老妈妈，还在每天将她老人家拾柴的钱捐给志愿军买飞机。那时我和我的僚机范万章同志听了晚上连觉都睡不着，总是想着：祖国人民为了支援我们每天省吃俭用辛勤地劳动着，为了什么？祖国人民伟大的行动使我产生了无比的力量，我以我是新中国的人民而自豪，为我们从事的抗美援朝战争的正义性而自豪。我知道在我背后有着祖国五亿人民的力量在支持着我。在这以后不久，我就创造了一次击落敌机两架的纪录。接着在一个月内，我一共打落、打伤了八架敌机。在战斗的时候，我只有一个信念，就是我怎样才能更好、更多地消灭敌人，以我们的胜利来回答祖国人民对我志愿空军的热望。记得一次我们从战区归航的路上，看到了一群老乌鸦般的敌机，正在一个小城市上空蹶着屁股扫射着朝鲜善良的和平人民。我一见到这情况，火就来了。我一头冲下去，瞄准了其中的一架，狠狠地揍了它几炮。看到它冒着烟掉下去，心里真是有说不出的愉快。但是我并没有因此而满足，这不过是我为祖国人民而战为朝鲜人民报仇的开始。当我击落敌机五架以后，有一次准备战斗的时候，我有些头昏，迷迷糊糊躺在飞机下面。当航空医生走到我跟前问我的时候，有一种力量支持着我使我不愿说出实话，因为这正是人民需要我的时候。我坚持着上了飞机。当我发现了敌机，强烈的仇恨使我猛烈地冲击敌人，飞行速度太快，机身控制不住，冲到敌机下边去，我赶紧用双手抱住操纵杆，猛烈地往上一拉，自己就昏了，是什么力量使我清醒过来，保持沉着，继续战斗呢？是祖国、毛主席和人民在召唤着我，使我又有力的战斗下去。我想，这就是我们年轻的志愿空军能够战胜美国空中强盗的一个根本原因。
    尤其是当我的战斗事迹传到祖国以后，我就接连不断接到从祖国各个角落寄来的慰问信。在不到一个月的时间，我收到好多封慰问信。光是从南京一个地方，就来了一百多封。这些写信的人有工人、有青年学生、有干部、有店员、有市民，更多的是正背着书包上学的小弟弟、小妹妹们。他们把自己心爱的学习优胜纪念章送给我，少年儿童队员把他们最珍贵的红领巾寄给我。南京一个小学生因为手头没有照片，就把他的学习证书上的照片撕下来送给我。东北四平的两位工人兄弟把我的战斗事迹画成画册邮寄给我。许多读报组集体给我写信；许多少年儿童立志要当空军；许多孩子用他们的小手把毛主席、朱总司令的像精致地装饰好了寄了来；许多教员告诉我他们正在把我的故事教育学生。模范的工人告诉我他们的增产成绩，说我替新中国的工人阶级增了光。特别使我感动的是他们把自己最神圣的愿望——申请入党的事告诉给我，让我和他们一同高兴。青年学生们告诉我他们要做我们的后备军，准备随时响应祖国的号召，到战斗的岗位上去。
    亲爱的同志们，我没有料想到自己只做了这么一点事情，祖国人民给我这样大的荣誉。我是一个战士，战士是热爱自己的荣誉的。但我从心底觉得我所做的和我所得到的荣誉是不相称的。特别是我这次回到祖国，看到了久经战斗锻炼的、光荣的人民解放军和许多英雄模范、人民功臣们所走过的艰苦的战斗道路来，比起他们为祖国人民立的功绩来，我这点点事迹算得什么呢？人民这样热爱我，关怀我，又一次教育了我：使我对祖国和人民更加百倍地热爱，我只有更好地更多地打击敌人，才能回答人民对我的热爱。（新华社）（附图片）
