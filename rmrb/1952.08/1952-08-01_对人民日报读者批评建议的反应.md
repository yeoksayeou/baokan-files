Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions for the People's Daily

Editor's Note: We are now publishing below a summary of the "Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions for the People's Daily" from various relevant parties.

    ▲ The Northwest General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore has accepted the suggestions put forward in the letters from readers Zhang Wu and Li Xianzhang (original letters published in this column on July 9th). In order to meet the urgent need for cultural food among workers on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, they dispatched a mobile sales team of seven people to work on the Tianshui-Lanzhou line in mid-June. Now, it has been decided that the Gansu branch will be responsible for organizing onboard service teams for the Tianshui and Baoji-Tianshui sections, so as to supply books and periodicals in a timely manner. The General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore also attaches great importance to the demands of the workers on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway. They have suggested that the Northwest General Branch urge the Gansu branch to organize an appropriate number of mobile book supply teams, and consider absorbing the experience of establishing the Huaihe branch specifically for the Huaihe River project workers, in order to establish a temporary branch for the workers on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway.

    ▲ The Beijing Electricity Bureau and the Beijing Tap Water Company have accepted a citizen's suggestion on "improving the method of paying electricity and water bills" (original suggestion published in this column on July 9th). The Beijing Electricity Bureau now arranges monthly meter readings and specified payment dates by district and day. Regarding the issue of organizing citizens to pay collectively, they are contacting and researching with relevant authorities, and will conduct publicity among the masses. The Beijing Tap Water Company has investigated the situation of collective payment of water bills by dozens of households in Xiangluying Toutiao, and plans to use meter reading time to publicize and promote the new payment method to water users.

    ▲ The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government attaches great importance to the suggestion put forward by the Political Department of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army that "revolutionary soldier's certificates should be transferred to the families of revolutionary soldiers quickly" (original suggestion published in this column on July 16th). They have prepared to notify the relevant county people's governments to handle this issue quickly; and instruct governments at all levels to pay attention to this issue in future work.

    ▲ Liang Xun, a comrade from the Construction Section of the United Xianglan and Xianghong Banner People's Government in Suiyuan Province, wrote a letter agreeing with Comrade Du Zhong's opinion on "Mongolian and Han people in the Ik Zhaomeng Autonomous Region requesting the Suiyuan Branch of the People's Bank of China to improve its loan business" (original suggestion published in this column on July 16th). According to his understanding, the United Xianglan and Xianghong Banner also has similar shortcomings in its loan work, and these shortcomings have caused dissatisfaction among the local people. He suggests that the Suiyuan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China solve this problem quickly.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    编者按：今将各有关方面“对人民日报读者批评建议的反应”摘要发表于后。
    ▲新华书店西北总分店接受读者张午、李宪章来信提出的建议（原信刊七月九日本栏）。他们为了满足天兰线工人对于文化食粮的迫切需要，已在六月中旬，派出由七个人组成的书刊流动推销组，到天兰线工作。现在又决定由甘肃分店负责组织天兰、宝天段随车服务队，以便及时供应书刊。新华书店总店也很重视天兰线工人的要求，他们已建议西北总分店督促甘肃支店组织适当数量的图书流动供应队，并考虑吸收专为治淮民工设立淮河支店的经验，为天兰线工人设立临时支店。
    ▲北京电业局和北京市自来水公司接受一市民关于“改进交纳水电费的办法”的建议（原建议刊七月九日本栏）。北京电业局每月抄表及限定交款日期，现已按区逐日排列。关于组织市民集体交费问题，他们正和有关机关联系、研究，并将向群众进行宣传。北京市自来水公司已调查了香炉营头条数十户用水户集体交纳水费的情况，准备利用查表时间，向用水户宣传推广新的交费办法。
    ▲中央人民政府内务部很重视中国人民志愿军某部政治处提出的“应该把革命军人证明书迅速转给革命军人家属”的建议（原建议刊七月十六日本栏）。他们已准备通知各有关县人民政府，迅速处理这个问题；并责成各级人民政府在今后工作中注意这个问题。
    ▲绥远省厢蓝厢红联合旗人民政府建设科梁薰同志来信，同意杜仲同志关于“伊克昭盟自治区蒙汉人民要求人民银行绥远分行改进贷款业务”的意见（原建议刊七月十六日本栏）。根据他的了解，厢蓝厢红联合旗在贷款工作中也有类似缺点，这些缺点已引起当地人民的不满。他建议人民银行绥远省分行迅速解决这个问题。
