    Suggestion to Check the Work Assignments of the Second Phase Graduates of East China Revolutionary University
    To the Editors:
    Approximately four thousand students graduated from the second phase of the East China People's Revolutionary University and participated in the land reform work in northern Anhui and other regions starting in October 1950. It has been almost two years now, and they are still working in the northern Anhui area. As far as we know, some of these cadres studied in university science and engineering colleges, but are now being kept in district and township positions doing work such as cultural station staff, clerks, and mail clerks. One student who studied railway engineering and was assigned to Feixi County in northern Anhui requested a job transfer, but his superiors told him: "Stay here and work diligently; when Feixi has a railway in the future, we will need you." A group of former engineering college students working as village primary school teachers in Lujiang County, northern Anhui, have "returned home" because they "couldn't get their thinking right." There are also some who are preparing to "return home." We suggest that the Personnel Department of the East China Military and Political Committee investigate this situation and take appropriate action quickly.

    建议检查华东革大二期毕业学员的工作分配情况
    编辑同志：华东人民革命大学第二期毕业的学员四千人左右，于一九五○年十月起参加皖北等地的土地改革工作，到现在快二年了，他们仍然留在皖北一带工作。据我们知道，这批干部中有些人是在大学理工学院学习过的，现在却被留在当地区、乡做文化站、文书、收发等工作。被留在皖北肥西县的一个学铁路工程的学员要求调动工作时，他的上级说：“你留下来安心工作，将来肥西有铁路时用得着你的。”在皖北庐江县做乡村小学教师的一批进过工学院的学员，因为“思想搞不通”而“复员”回家去了。还有些人正准备“复员”。我们建议华东军政委员会人事部检查一下这种情况，并迅速作适当处理。汪向东  徐铭  高省之
