Editor's Note: This newspaper has received a letter from all 58 students of the political science and law education workers—teachers of political science and law departments from universities across the country—at the Central School of Political Science and Law for Cadres, expressing their support for the judicial reform movement. The original letter is as follows:

Editor,
After reading the People's Daily editorial of August 17, "Judicial Work Must Be Thoroughly Reformed," and the report of August 23 by Minister of Justice Shi Liang of the Central Ministry of Justice, "On Thoroughly Reforming and Consolidating People's Courts at All Levels," we unanimously believe that launching a judicial reform movement is completely correct and in line with the demands of the broad masses of the people.

We are educators from political science and law departments of universities across the country, currently studying at the Central School of Political Science and Law for Cadres. Since liberation, although we have made some improvements in the content and methods of teaching under the leadership of the People's Government, serious chaos still exists in practice. The main reason for this is the insidious influence of reactionary old legal viewpoints. For example, civil procedure law teachers still find the "three-part syllogism judgment" – main text, facts, and reasoning – fascinating; commercial law teachers consider negotiable instruments law to be a "universal" law and lecture based on old legal provisions; criminal law textbooks still contain the fallacy of "equality before the law" regardless of friend or foe; when teaching the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries, they emphasize "not pursuing past offenses"; civil law still talks about the absolute "principle of freedom of contract" divorced from the New Democratic policy, and even uses the civil law textbook written by Japanese fascist Waga Sakae as a reference; some even cloak themselves in Marxism-Leninism and, under the guise of "comparative critique," instill bourgeois reactionary legal theories into students; and many more use old legal viewpoints to formally view current policies and decrees. These kinds of reactionary old legal theories and ideas are, to varying degrees, a part of the teaching content, and even dominate certain courses, directly causing serious harm to the people's political science and law education work. This is clearly completely contrary to the New Democratic national construction and the demands of the broad masses of the people.

The vigorous ideological remolding movement is currently being carried out across the country. For political science and law educators, criticizing and eliminating old legal viewpoints is one of the specific contents of ideological remolding and a major key to future curriculum reform in political science and law departments. Only by thoroughly eliminating old legal viewpoints can we talk about the task of cultivating a large number of political science and law cadres in the future. Therefore, we unanimously believe that this great judicial reform movement is an excellent opportunity for our self-transformation. We not only express our sincere support and endorsement, but also resolve to comprehensively, systematically, and deeply examine teaching ideology and content during the movement, mobilize the broad masses of teachers and students to use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to expose and criticize the old legal viewpoints in teaching and their harmfulness, and transform and improve ourselves in the great practical movement. At the same time, we hope that all political science and law educators in universities across the country will actively respond to and participate in this great movement, strictly carry out ideological criticism, and jointly strive to eliminate anti-people old legal viewpoints and strive for the complete victory of the judicial reform movement!

All students of political science and law education workers at the Central School of Political Science and Law for Cadres – Wang Xiaowen, Professor of the Law Department of Shanghai College; Wang Jin, Professor of the Law Department of Guangxi University; Lu Gandong, Professor and Dean of the College of Arts and Law of South China United University; Song Enpu, Lecturer of Shanghai College; Lou Bangyan, Professor of the Department of Political Science of Peking University; Huang Delu, Professor of the Department of Politics of Chongqing University; Cao Shaolian, Director of the Department of Politics of Wuhan University; Wang Dehui, Director of the Department of History and Politics of Lingnan University, and 50 others (signed).

### 在中央政法干部学校学习的各大学教师致函本报  拥护司法改革和反旧法观点运动

    在中央政法干部学校学习的各大学教师致函本报
    拥护司法改革和反旧法观点运动
    编者按：本报顷接中央政法干部学校政法教育工作者全体学员——全国各大学政法学系教师五十八人来函，表示拥护司法改革运动。原函如下：
    编辑同志：我们读了八月十七日人民日报“必须彻底改革司法工作”的社论及八月二十三日中央司法部史良部长“关于彻底改造和整顿各级人民法院的报告”以后，我们一致认为开展一个司法改革运动，是完全正确和符合广大人民的要求的。
    我们是来自全国各高等学校政法学系的教育工作者，现在中央政法干部学校学习。解放后我们在人民政府领导下，对教学内容和方法虽然有些改进，但实际上还存在着严重的混乱现象。其主要原因，就是反动的旧法观点在作祟。例如诉讼法教师对“三段论法的判决”——主文、事实、理由的一套仍然津津有味；商事法教师把票据法认为是“世界性”的法律，而依据旧法条文讲解；刑法教材中还有不分敌我的“法律面前人人平等”的谬论；讲授惩治反革命条例时强调“不究既往”；民法还讲什么离开新民主主义政策的绝对的“契约自由原理”，甚至以日本法西斯分子我妻荣所著的民法教本为参考教材；有的则披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，以“比较批判”为名，向学生灌输资产阶级的反动法学理论；更有不少人用旧法观点从形式上来看待现行政策法令。这类反动的旧法理论和思想，在教学中或多或少地作为教学内容的一部分，甚至在某些课程中占着统治地位，直接给人民政法教育工作造成了严重危害。这和新民主主义的国家建设和广大人民的要求，显然是完全背道而驰的。
    轰轰烈烈的思想改造运动，目前正在全国普遍开展，对于政法教育工作者，批判和肃清旧法观点正是思想改造的具体内容之一，也是政法学系今后课程改革的主要关键。只有把旧法观点彻底肃清，才能谈到今后培养大批政法工作干部的任务。所以我们一致认为这个伟大的司法改革运动，正是我们自我改造的一个极好机会。我们不仅表示热诚拥护和支持，并决心在运动中全面地系统地深入检查教学思想和教学内容，发动广大师生以批评与自我批评的武器，揭发和批判教学中的旧法观点和它的危害性，在伟大的实际运动中改造自己，提高自己。同时希望全国各大学政法教育工作者都来积极地响应和参加这个伟大的运动，严格地进行思想批判，共同为肃清反人民的旧法观点而奋斗，争取司法改革运动的彻底胜利！
    中央政法干部学校全体政法教育工作者学员——上海学院法律系教授王效文、广西大学法律系教授王觐、华南联合大学文法学院教授兼院长卢干东、上海学院讲师宋恩溥、北京大学政治学系教授楼邦彦、重庆大学政治系教授黄德禄、武汉大学政治系主任曹绍濂、岭南大学历史政治系主任王德辉等五十八人（签名）。
