    Immediately Strengthen Leadership on Cadre Reading and Studying Newspapers
    Editor's Note: Since March 22nd of this year, when the broad readership began to expose the situation of neglect of reading and studying newspapers by staff members of various organs, enterprises, schools, and hospitals in this column, the issue of strengthening reading and studying newspapers has attracted the attention of all parties. According to recent letters received by this newspaper, the Party committees of fourteen cities, fourteen special districts, and twenty-seven counties in twenty-three provinces have conducted in-depth inspections of the reading and study of newspapers by staff members of their subordinate departments and have formulated measures to strengthen current affairs study. We believe that after inspecting the situation of cadres reading and studying newspapers, it is essential to immediately strengthen ideological leadership on cadre reading and studying newspapers and establish and adhere to various practical and effective learning systems. We hope that Party committees and relevant departments in various regions will frequently write to us about their experiences and results in carrying out newspaper reading work.

    立即加强关于干部读报学习的领导
    编者按：广大读者从今年三月二十二日开始在本栏揭发各地机关、企业、学校、医院等部门工作人员忽视读报学习的情况以来，加强读报学习的问题，已经引起了各方面的重视。从本报最近收到的来信看来，已经有二十三个省的十四个市、十四个专区、二十七个县的党委，对所属部门工作人员的读报学习情况，进行了深入的检查，并且订出了加强时事学习的办法。我们认为，在检查了干部读报学习的情况以后，立即加强关于干部读报学习的思想领导，建立并坚持各种切实有效的学习制度，是十分必要的。希望各地党委和有关部门把开展读报工作的经验及效果，经常写给我们。
