An introduction to the Chinese version of Issue 153 of the Cominform organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!"

This issue contains the resolutions of the Special Session of the World Peace Council in Berlin, and publishes an editorial entitled "The Power of the Peace Camp is Infinite." The editorial states: Peace cannot be waited for, peace must be striven for. Communist and Workers' Parties must tell all working people and all people of goodwill: the fate of peace and the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact depend on their efforts; they must strengthen their determination to defend peace to the end, and mobilize and lead them to actively struggle for the maintenance and consolidation of peace.

This issue contains an article by Grenier, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, entitled "The Great Communist Construction Projects of the Soviet Union." He said: The current great construction projects in the Soviet Union differ from previous construction projects in the Soviet Union in terms of scale, nature, and tasks. The current project is not only to make rational use of the natural resources of a certain region, but also to fundamentally change the original appearance of some areas and to achieve unprecedented development of industry and agriculture in these areas. Grenier then introduced the overall picture of several communist construction projects under construction in the Soviet Union, and cited the recession of the French economy as a comparison. Grenier finally said: The great communist construction projects of the Soviet Union clearly prove that Stalin's country is working for peace, and the infinite creative talents of the Soviet people are serving peace. These projects increase the working class's confidence in achieving final victory throughout the world. This also explains why every working man and woman in France unanimously responded to Thorez's solemn declaration: the French people will never fight against the Soviet people.

This issue also contains excerpts from a speech by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, at the Romanian Coal Miners' Representative Conference: "Strive for Greater Victories in the Socialist Construction of the Romanian People's Republic." Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out the achievements of the Romanian coal mining industry since liberation and the improvement of miners' lives, and exposed the activities of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, one of the former secretaries of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, who attempted to sabotage the development of the coal mining industry, as well as the anti-Party economic policies of the Pătrășcanu, Ana Pauker, and Georgescu group. He then said: The Five-Year Plan and the National Electrification Plan have put extremely important tasks on the coal mining industry. The party organizations in the mining areas must constantly ensure that the party's line is correctly implemented and thoroughly eliminate the influence of right-leaning deviations in the party and economic work in the mining areas. Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized: We must and can increase coal production, reaching 2.6 times the 1950 output in 1955, and ensure that production reaches 20 to 25 million tons during the second five-year plan.

This issue also contains an article by Werner, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, entitled "Schumacher, Vetter and others are Shameless Traitors Who Betray the West German Working Class." He said: The West German working class's dissatisfaction with the current political and economic situation is growing day by day. The working class demands resolute and effective action, even a general strike, to oppose the policies of the Bonn government. The right-wing leaders of the German Trade Union Federation betrayed the workers' fighting actions, and they tried to divert workers from the current fundamental task—opposing the militaristic "General Treaty." They openly declared that whoever raises political issues in the struggle is against the trade union. However, this plan of the right-wing trade union leaders has been慘败 suffered a miserable defeat in many places, and the broad masses of workers have condemned the so-called "trade union neutrality" line. The working masses are awakening and are advancing on the road of unity. Werner said: Progressive forces must strengthen their work in the trade unions, and must combine the struggle for a peace treaty, against the "General Treaty," and for mobilizing the masses to safeguard their urgent demands.

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一五三期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五三期已经出版。
    本期刊载了世界和平理事会柏林特别会议的各项决议，并发表了题为“和平阵营的力量是无穷的”的社论。社论说：和平不能等待，和平必须争取。共产党和工人党必须告诉一切劳动人民、一切善良人士：和平的命运、五大国和平公约的缔结有赖于他们的努力；必须加强他们把和平维护到底的决心，动员和领导他们为维护和巩固和平而积极斗争。
    本期刊载了法国共产党中央委员会委员格勒尼埃的文章：“苏联伟大的共产主义建设工程”。他说：苏联目前的伟大建设工程，无论在规模、性质及其任务上，都和苏联以前的建设工程不同。目前的工程不仅是要合理使用某一地区的天然资源，而且还要根本改变某些地区的本来面目，并使这些地区的工业和农业得到空前的发展。格勒尼埃接着介绍了苏联正在建设中的几个共产主义建设工程的全貌，并举出法国经济衰退的情形作为对比。格勒尼埃最后说：苏联伟大的共产主义建设工程明白地证明：斯大林的国家在为和平而努力，苏联各族人民的无限创造才能都是为和平而服务的。这些工程增加了工人阶级对于在全世界取得最后胜利的信心。这也说明了为什么法国每一个男女工人都异口同声响应多列士的庄严声明：法国人民永远不对苏联人民作战。
    本期并刊载了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌—德治在罗马尼亚煤矿工人代表会议上的演说摘要：“为争取罗马尼亚人民共和国社会主义建设更大的胜利而奋斗”。乔治乌—德治指出了解放以来罗马尼亚煤矿工业的成就和矿工生活改善的情形，并揭露了工人党中央委员会前任书记之一卢加企图破坏煤矿工业发展的活动和卢加、安娜·波克、乔治斯库集团反党的经济政策。他接着说：五年计划和全国电气化计划，给煤矿工业提出了极其重大的任务，采矿地区的党组织必须经常地保证党的路线得以正确执行，把矿区党和经济工作中的右倾偏向的影响彻底清除。乔治乌—德治强调说：我们必须而且能够增加煤产量，在一九五五年达到一九五○年产量的二点六倍，并保证在第二个五年计划期间达到两千到两千五百万吨产量。
    本期还刊载了德国统一社会党中央委员会书记处书记维尔纳的题为“舒马赫、费特等是出卖西德工人阶级的无耻叛徒”一文。他说：西德工人阶级对于目前政治和经济形势的不满一天比一天高涨，工人阶级要求采取坚决的、有效的行动，甚至举行总罢工，反对波恩政府的政策。德国工会联合会的右翼领袖背叛了工人们的战斗行动，他们力图使工人不注意当前的基本任务——反对军国主义的“一般性条约”。他们公然宣称，谁在斗争时提出政治问题谁就是反对工会。但是右翼工会领袖这个计划在许多地方遭到了惨败，广大的工人群众斥责所谓“工会中立”路线。工人群众正在觉醒过来，他们正在联合道路上前进。维尔纳说：进步力量必须加强在工会中的工作，必须把争取缔结和约、反对“一般性条约”，和动员人民群众维护他们迫切要求的斗争结合起来。
