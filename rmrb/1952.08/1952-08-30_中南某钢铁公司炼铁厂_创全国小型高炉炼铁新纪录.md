The staff of an iron and steel plant in Central-South China, by studying the advanced Soviet experiences of the All-Wind Rapid Method and light-alkaline heavy material operations, have created the highest national record for iron smelting in small blast furnaces. Currently, the utilization coefficient of a certain small blast furnace in the plant has reached 0.948 tons per cubic meter, and the coke-to-iron ratio has also been reduced from 1.316 to 0.926. The average daily output of this furnace from January to July this year has exceeded the original plan by 97.5 percent, an increase of 40 percent compared to the same period last year, creating 2 billion yuan in wealth for the country.

The specific experiences they gained from studying the advanced Soviet iron smelting methods are: (1) Fully utilize equipment capacity according to specific Soviet standards, increase the air volume, and accelerate the descending speed of the furnace charge. (2) In terms of batching, change from the past strong-alkaline slag to light-alkaline slag, reduce limestone, and increase ore; at the same time, accurately grasp the raw material composition of the plant according to Soviet batching regulations for proportioning. (3) Strictly control the accuracy of raw materials according to Soviet technical regulations to reduce the impact of ash content and uneven size of raw materials on output and quality. (4) Strictly implement the furnace door maintenance system to ensure production safety. (5) Learn from the Soviet method of judging the composition of iron from iron water sparks and surface crystallization to improve technology.

The emergence of the new iron smelting record has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the plant's administrative and technical personnel and workers to actively learn from advanced Soviet experiences. Currently, some technical personnel and workers in the plant are actively learning Russian in order to directly read Soviet technical books and improve their technical level.

    中南某钢铁公司炼铁厂
    创全国小型高炉炼铁新纪录
    中南某钢铁公司炼铁厂职工学习苏联全风快速法与轻碱性重料作业的先进经验，创造了全国小型高炉炼铁的最高纪录。目前该厂某号小炼铁炉产量的利用系数已达到零点九四八立方公尺一吨，焦铁比率也由一点三一六降低到零点九二六。该炉今年一月至七月的平均日产量，已超过原订计划的百分之九十七点五，较去年同时期提高了百分之四十，为国家创造了二十亿元的财富。
    他们在学习苏联先进炼铁工作法中所获得的具体经验是：（一）按苏联的具体标准，充分利用设备能力，加大风量，加快炉料下行速度。（二）在配料上，由过去的强碱性渣改为轻碱性渣，减少石灰石，加重矿石；同时根据苏联配料规定，确切掌握本厂原料成份，进行配制。（三）根据苏联技术规定，严格掌握原料精度，以减少由于原料的灰份与大小不匀对产量、质量的影响。（四）严格执行维护炉门制度，保证生产安全。（五）学习苏联从铁水火花与表面结晶上看铁的成份，以提高技术。
    炼铁新纪录的出现，大大鼓舞了该厂行政、技术人员与工人们积极学习苏联先进经验的热情。现在该厂有些技术人员和工人正在积极学习俄文，以便直接阅读苏联技术书籍，提高自己的技术水平。
