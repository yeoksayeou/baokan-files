    Commemorating the 15th Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident
    Japan-China Friendship Association Sends Letter to Pay Tribute to the People of Our Country
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 8th] To commemorate the 15th anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident, the Standing Council of the Japan-China Friendship Association sent a letter to the Chinese people on July 7th, expressing their oath to fight against the resurgence of Japanese militarist forces, to prevent the "July 7th" Incident from recurring, and to promote peaceful and friendly relations between the people of China and Japan. The full text of the Japan-China Friendship Association's letter to the Chinese people is as follows:
    Today, as we commemorate the 15th anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident, when the past Japanese militarists began their violent war of aggression against your country's territory and people, we review the path the Japanese people have taken and consider Japan's current international position. We would like to reaffirm to your people our determination to carry out the Japan-China friendship movement and extend our heartfelt respect.
    At present, you are giving our Japanese people warm friendship and sympathy, as can be fully understood from the recent Sino-Japanese trade agreement. The Japanese people enthusiastically support this agreement and hope that it can be realized. This is clearly demonstrated by the enthusiastic welcome that the people gave to Mr. Hoashi Kei and Mr. Miyakoshi Kisuke, two directors of our association, upon their return to Japan on July 1st. Requests to hear the reports of the two gentlemen are widespread, from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south. Telegrams and letters from all over the country requesting the convening of welcome report meetings for the two gentlemen have piled up in the office like a mountain. This does not only mean the Japanese people's strong desire for Sino-Japanese trade, but also reflects their ardent desire for Sino-Japanese friendship and peace.
    However, various obstacles still exist in the face of the people's ardent desire. It is manifested in the fact that instead of establishing normal neighborly relations with your government representing 470 million people, it concluded the "Sino-Japanese Treaty" with the Taiwan regime in exile, and did not issue passports to the Japanese workers' representatives invited by your country's trade unions to attend the May Day celebrations, and even threw them into prison. These facts are closely linked to the revival of militarism, which seeks to create new terrors and disasters for Japan and Asia while the bloodstains of the "July 7th" Incident are not yet dry. We, the Japanese people, will never allow the "July 7th" Incident to recur, and we must insist on peace and friendship between Japan and China. In order to oppose the path to war and destruction, we must fight to the end.
    At this time, we have learned in detail about the situation of the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing. The purpose of the meeting, which is based on mutual respect and friendship and preventing the threat of war, regardless of all thoughts, beliefs, and political views, is completely consistent with the intentions of our association. The Standing Council of our association supports this peace conference and has decided to send representatives to attend. Our association's representatives will participate in the conference for peace and friendship and raise various issues existing between Japan and China.
    On behalf of the people's friendship and enthusiasm, I wish your country's peaceful construction great success!

    纪念“七七”十五周年
    日中友协写信向我国人民致敬
    【新华社八日讯】日中友好协会常任理事会为纪念“七七”十五周年，在七月七日致书中国人民，表示誓为反对日本军国主义势力的再起、不让“七七”重演和推进中日两国人民间的和平友好关系而奋斗。日中友协致中国人民书的全文如下：
    今天，我们在迎接过去日本军国主义者对贵国领土和人民开始进行狂暴侵略战争的“七七”十五周年之际，回顾日本人民所走过来的道路，并想到目前日本所处的国际地位，谨向贵国人民重新表示开展日中友好运动的决心，并致以由衷的敬意。
    现在，你们对我们日本人民是如何地给与热诚的友谊和同情，从最近的中日贸易协议来看，即可充分了解。日本人民是怎样热烈地拥护这个协议，希望它能够实现，明显地表现在本协会理事帆足计和宫腰喜助两位先生七月一日回国以来，人民对他们的狂热的欢迎上，希望听到两位先生报告的请求，北至北海道，南达九州，至为普遍。来自全国各地的要求召开欢迎两氏报告会的电报和信件，已像山一样积满办公室。这并非仅仅是意味着日本人民对日中贸易的热望，而且也反映了他们对日中友好与和平的热烈愿望。
    然而，在人民的这种热烈愿望面前，尚存在着各种各样的障碍。它表现在：不和代表四亿七千万人民的贵国人民政府建立正常的邻邦关系，反而与台湾亡命政权缔结了“日华条约”，以及“五一”节时不发给被贵国工会邀请观礼的日本工人代表以护照，并将他们投入狱中等等事实上。这些事实是与“七七”血迹未干，即又图给日本和亚洲制造新的恐怖和灾难的军国主义的复活，密切相连的。我们日本人民无论如何也不让“七七”重演，无论如何也必须坚持日中两国的和平与友好，为了反对走向战争与毁灭，我们一定坚决斗争到底。
    当这个时候，我们详尽地得知在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的情形，会议的不分一切思想、信仰、政治见解，建筑在互相尊重与友谊基础上的和平友好及防止战争威胁的宗旨，是与我们协会的意图完全一致的。我们协会的常任理事会支持这个和平会议，并已决定派代表出席。我们协会的代表将为和平与友好参加会议，提出存在于日中两国间的各种问题。
    谨代表人民的友谊与热情，祝贵国的和平建设获得伟大的成功！
