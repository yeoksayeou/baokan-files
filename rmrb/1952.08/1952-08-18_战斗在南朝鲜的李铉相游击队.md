    The Lee Hyun-sang Guerrilla Unit Fighting in South Korea
    In Korea, anyone who knows Mount Jiri knows Lee Hyun-sang; even those who don’t know Mount Jiri know about the people's guerrilla unit led by Lee Hyun-sang, which frequently inflicts heavy blows on the enemy. Lee Hyun-sang and his tens of thousands of South Korean youth are now inseparable from the name Mount Jiri.
    The Lee Hyun-sang People's Guerrilla Unit was formed after the Jeju Island people's armed uprising in 1948 against the "May 10th" traitorous election struggle, during the Suncheon people's riot. They were railway workers from Suncheon, Gwangju, Hwasun, and other places, the majority of workers from local factories and mines, and South Korean soldiers who revolted in Honam (Note: Refers to the plain from Gunsan to Mokpo, commonly known as the "Honam Plain") and Yeongnam (Note: Refers to the area south of the Sobaek Mountains). These patriotic young men and women joined the guerrilla units led by Kim Ji-hoe, Choi Hyun, Hong Soon-seok, and others, under the unified command of Lee Hyun-sang, inheriting General Kim Il-sung's excellent traditions from the anti-Japanese war, and fighting with unwavering loyalty for the liberation of the fatherland.
    In order to attack the northern part of the Republic, the enemy attempted to first wipe out the guerrilla units in the rear. In December 1949, the Lee Hyun-sang People's Guerrilla Unit raided Jinju City, the base of the enemy's so-called "suppression operation," and liberated all of Jinju. Subsequently, more than a dozen cities and hundreds of towns and villages in Gwangju, Gwangyang, Jangheung, Naju, Hampyeong, Gangjin, Goheung, Yeongam, Gokseong in Jeolla Province, and Geochang, Hapcheon, and Hadong in Gyeongsang Province were simultaneously liberated. This is the famous "Great Victory of Jinju." This battle disrupted the invaders' timetable for advancing north.
    For five years, the enemy mobilized hundreds of thousands of so-called "suppression" troops, using aircraft, tanks, and various new types of killing weapons, and constantly launched "suppression" offensives. However, none of their conspiracies ended without a miserable defeat. The enemy never managed to pull down the Republic's flag from the peaks of Mount Jiri, and to this day, the forests here remain the burial ground for enemies who venture to attack.
    Recently, although the reactionary newspapers have repeatedly spread rumors that "the guerrilla units in the Mount Jiri area have been completely ‘suppressed’ and ‘eliminated’," the enemy has never been able to cross the Mount Jiri area since 1948 until now. It has always been under the control of the people's guerrilla unit and is safe and sound. Even the enemy admits bluntly that "Mount Jiri is a ‘non-South Korea’ within ‘South Korean’ territory." In fact, it not only does not belong to the jurisdiction of the puppet regime, but is also the mortal enemy of the invaders and traitors.
    The Lee Hyun-sang People's Guerrilla Unit has developed and grown stronger in the great Korean People's Anti-Aggression War. After the Lee Seung-man gang, under the direction of the United States, launched an attack on the northern half of Korea on June 25, 1950, the Lee Hyun-sang People's Guerrilla Unit launched more extensive activities behind enemy lines to cooperate with the heroic counterattack of the People's Army. They constantly carried out surprise attacks on the enemy, contained the enemy, and paved the way for the People's Army's advance. When the enemy fled in panic to the narrow area east of the Nakdong River and concentrated all their forces to shift the front line to the Nakdong River, a fierce battle of offense and defense began. The Lee Hyun-sang People's Guerrilla Unit decided to assist the People's Army in its operations, and on August 1, they crossed the Nakdong River and engaged the 10th Regiment of the puppet National Defense Forces' 3rd Division in Changnyeong and Uok-myeon. The reconnaissance and assault groups of the People's Guerrilla Unit haunted the enemy's surroundings, moved horizontally between Daegu and Cheongdo, destroyed a large number of highways, railways, and bridges, paralyzed the enemy's transportation and communication, and repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. A certain reconnaissance group of the Lee Young-hoe People's Guerrilla Unit, under the command of Lee Hyun-sang, raided the US military radio station in Chugyeongsan, 30 li from Daegu, on August 11, and seized many confidential documents, thereby learning the location of the "US Military Nakdong River Front Command." At dawn on August 27, Lee Young-hoe led his troops to attack this "command" located in Goaam area of Changnyeong County, killing more than a hundred US military officers on the spot and capturing more than 30 tanks and military trucks. This "command" disintegrated as a result.
    After the heroic People's Army carried out a strategic retreat, the task of the People's Guerrilla Unit became even more important, so their activities also expanded. They reorganized various guerrilla units in the southern half and, with Mount Jiri as the center, united closely under the command of Lee Hyun-sang, maintained close contact with the People's Army troops remaining in the area, and widely launched guerrilla warfare, creating countless brilliant achievements.
    In April 1951, the People's Guerrilla Unit developed to the stage of attacking large cities. On April 20, they captured Gwangju City and attacked the headquarters of the Lee Seung-man puppet army's 20th Regiment; and on May 27, they liberated Chungju City, rescuing hundreds of patriotic men from prison. This series of attacks sent chills down the enemy's spine.
    Faced with the new situation, in order to launch an organized and unified guerrilla war, Lee Hyun-sang convened an operational meeting on August 15, 1951, in the guerrilla area of Unbong Mountain, Namwon County, Jeolla Province, with the deputy captains and political commissars of the guerrilla units from various regions participating. The conference resolved to strengthen the unified leadership and contact of the five regional guerrilla units and to launch a military and political offensive under the leadership of Lee Hyun-sang. Thus, in September, when the five grains began to appear on the Honam Plain, all the units sharing the unified operation, under the name of the joint forces, launched a fierce struggle in their respective areas against the enemy's grain grabbing and protecting the people's autumn harvest. On October 16, the guerrilla unit in the Seodaesan area of North Jeolla Province attacked Jiwon-myeon, Geumsan County, a granary area, and seized more than 4,000 sacks of grain from the enemy, distributing them to the hungry and cold farmers. The struggle of the People's Guerrilla Unit received enthusiastic support from farmers in various places.
    The farmers around Mount Jiri and Mount Baekun all loved the People's Guerrilla Unit, and they spared no effort to assist the activities of the People's Guerrilla Unit, often providing them with supplies, rescuing their wounded, and scouting enemy positions. On several occasions, the People's Guerrilla Unit avoided enemy ambushes thanks to farmers reporting enemy situations.
    After the August Conference, with the direct support of the people, the People's Guerrilla Units in various regions, within four months, swept through more than 20 cities such as Geochang, Hamyang, Jangsu, Muju, Jeongeup, and Sooncheon, and wiped out the puppet military and police outposts and countless police headquarters and branches, paralyzing and disrupting the enemy's administrative system in vast areas.
    During this period, the People's Guerrilla Unit carried out more than 2,000 struggles to blow up railways, bridges, and cut off the enemy's transportation network. On September 13, a brave and resourceful engineering assault group blew up the Chupungnyeong Tunnel on the Gyeongbu Line, paralyzing the enemy's heart transportation. On the Gyeongbu and Jeolla Lines, the guerrilla unit also constantly attacked the enemy's military trains.
    Taking advantage of the Korean armistice negotiations, the vicious American bandits, with the US 5th Air Force and armored units as the vanguard, mobilized two divisions of the puppet army and police terror groups, totaling hundreds of thousands of troops, and under the direct command of the US military, launched a so-called "joint military-police suppression" for about 70 days from December 1951.
    After surrounding the guerrilla area in one, two, and three layers, the enemy desperately compressed the area towards various strongholds, attempting to cut off the guerrilla unit's communication and activities. The bandits set fires everywhere and killed people everywhere. Countless innocent farmers died tragically at their hands; the mountains and fields turned into a sea of fire, and the countryside turned into ruins. This is the enemy's so-called "scorched earth tactics."
    In the two provinces of Jeolla, the bandits burned down more than 60,000 farmhouses in just two months. After this looting spree, they drove more than 200,000 elderly and weak farmers into the snowy mountains and fields. They attempted to cut off the connection between the farmers and the guerrilla unit by extremely horrific means, so more than 17,000 farmers died tragically under the guns and knives of the murderers. According to a report by the US Congress, in December 1951 alone, 1,655 children under the age of 15 were shot, stabbed, or buried alive in this area, of which 964 were infants under the age of 10. They also massacred 161 elderly people over the age of 50 in the same cruel way.
    Lee Hyun-sang had long anticipated that the enemy would launch such an offensive. Before the enemy launched the offensive, he had already dispersed and reorganized the People's Guerrilla Unit into countless elite groups, who moved in and out of the encirclement and resolutely met the enemy's mad attack.
    The notorious "Capital Division" of the puppet National Defense Forces was used as the vanguard of this "suppression." In early December, one of its battalions began to search and encircle Hill 1815 of Mount Jiri. Lee Hyun-sang directly commanded the guerrilla unit, cleverly luring the enemy deep into the narrow valley near the highest peak. In that snowy valley, the People's Guerrilla Unit launched a counter-encirclement, annihilating the enemy. At the same time, Lee Hyun-sang dispatched a large number of propaganda organizers more extensively to the cities and villages of Geumju, Gwangju, and Hwasun to continue to consolidate local organizations, strengthen propaganda work, and break the enemy's conspiracy to isolate the People's Guerrilla Unit.
    The enemy's "Capital Division" suffered more than 3,500 casualties in this "suppression," and the other two divisions of the puppet National Defense Forces were also routed in February of this year. Their corpses were scattered in the mountains and fields that they themselves had burned. The bandits received their due punishment.
    On April 4 this year, Lee Hyun-sang convened a joint conference of the People's Guerrilla Units in Jeolla and Chungcheong Provinces, attended by the party committees of each province, and the captains and political commissars of each guerrilla unit. According to the struggle situation after the "August Conference," the conference resolved to strengthen political propaganda and to effectively use the dispersed group struggle form to continue to widely launch struggles.
    The Lee Hyun-sang People's Guerrilla Unit fighting in South Korea is a heroic unit, a people's unit. They are not only able to win every battle, but also constantly train cadres under extremely difficult conditions and educate all members with Marxism-Leninism. In the Mount Jiri area, there are cadre training institutions such as party schools, political colleges, and youth league colleges, and a large number of young people are recruited from all aspects. Therefore, they are not only an invincible army fighting for justice, but also a people's army with thoughts, and growing in military and political maturity.

### 战斗在南朝鲜的李铉相游击队

    战斗在南朝鲜的李铉相游击队
    在朝鲜，只要晓得智异山的人，没有不晓得李铉相的；甚至不晓得智异山的，也晓得由李铉相领导的、经常给敌人以沉重打击的人民游击队。李铉相及其所部十几万南朝鲜青年，已经与智异山的名字分不开了。
    李铉相人民游击队是继一九四八年济州岛人民武装抗暴斗争之后，在反抗“五·一○”亡国选举斗争的顺天人民暴动中形成的。他们是顺天、光州、和顺等地的铁路工人，和当地工厂、矿山的大部分工人，以及在湖南（按：指从群山到木浦的平原，通称“湖南平原”）、岭南（按：指车岭山脉以南地区）等地起义的南朝鲜士兵组织起来的。这批爱国的男女青年们，分别参加在金志会、崔显、洪顺石等所领导的游击队里，在李铉相的统一指挥下，继承着金日成将军在抗日战争中的优良传统，无限忠诚地为解放祖国而战斗。
    敌人为了要向共和国北部进攻，企图先扑灭后方的游击队。一九四九年十二月，李铉相人民游击队奇袭了敌人的所谓“讨伐作战”的根据地晋州市，解放了晋州全部。接着全罗南道的光州、光阳、长兴、罗州、咸平、康津、高兴、灵岩、谷城和庆尚南道的居昌、陕川、河东等十几个城市及几百个村镇都同时获得了解放。这就是著名的“晋州大捷”。这一战打乱了侵略者北进的时间表。
    五年来，敌人前后动员了几十万所谓“讨伐”的兵力，使用飞机、坦克和各种新式杀人武器，不断发动“讨伐”攻势。然而他们的阴谋没有一次不是以惨败而结束的。敌人一次也没能从智异山的峰巅上拔下共和国国旗，直到今天，这里的森林依然是冒险进攻的敌人的葬身之地。
    最近，反动报纸虽然屡次造谣说：“智异山区的游击队已完全被‘讨伐’‘肃清’”，可是，自从一九四八年直到现在，敌人始终没能逾越智异山区一步，这里一直在人民游击队的控制下，安全无恙。甚至敌人也直认不讳地说：“智异山是‘韩国’领土内的‘非韩国’”。事实也的确如此，它不仅不属傀儡政权的管辖，而且还是侵略者和卖国贼的死对头。
    李铉相人民游击队是在伟大的朝鲜人民反侵略战争中发展和壮大起来的。在一九五○年六月二十五日，李承晚匪帮在美国指使下向朝鲜北半部发动进攻后，李铉相人民游击队在敌后展开了更广泛的活动，以配合人民军的英勇反击。他们不断对敌人进行奇袭，牵制敌人，替人民军铺平了进攻的道路。当敌人仓皇地向洛东江以东的狭小地区败走，并且集结全力把战线转移到洛东江的时候，炽烈的攻防战开始了。李铉相人民游击队决定协助人民军作战，他们于八月一日跨过洛东江，在昌宁与右玉面的傀儡国防军第三师第十联队接了火。人民游击队的侦察组和袭击组，出没于敌人的周围，纵横活动于大邱、清道之间，破坏大批的公路、铁道和桥梁，瘫痪了敌人的运输和联络，一再给予敌人以惨重的打击。在李铉相指挥下的李永会人民游击队的某侦察组，于八月十一日奇袭了离大邱三十里的秋景山美军无线电台，卤获了很多机密文件，从而得知“美军洛东江前线司令部”的位置。八月二十七日拂晓，李永会率部袭击了位于昌宁郡高岩地区的这个“司令部”，当场击毙了美军军官百余名，俘获坦克和军用卡车三十多辆。这个“司令部”就此瓦解。
    当英雄的人民军执行战略撤退以后，人民游击队的任务更加重要了，因此，他们的活动也跟着扩大了。他们在南半部重新组织了各种游击队，并以智异山为中心，紧密团结在李铉相的指挥下，和留在当地的人民军部队取得密切联系，广泛地展开游击战争，创造了无数的光辉战绩。
    人民游击队在一九五一年四月曾发展到对大城市进攻的阶段。他们于四月二十日打下了光州市，攻击了李承晚伪军第二十联队本部；又于五月二十七日解放了忠州，救出了狱中的几百名爱国志士。这一连串的袭击，使敌人不寒而栗。
    面临着新的形势，为了展开有机的统一的游击战争，李铉相就于一九五一年八月十五日在全罗北道南原郡云峰山游击区召开了一个有各地区游击部队的副队长和政治委员参加的作战会议。大会决议：加强五个地区游击部队的统一领导和联系，并以李铉相为首统一展开军事的和政治的攻势。于是，当湖南平原地区五谷开始登场的九月里，在联合部队的名义下，所有分担统一作战的各部队，都在自己活动的区域内，分别展开了反对敌人抢粮和保护人民秋收的炽烈的斗争。十月十六日，全罗北道西台山地区的游击队进攻了谷仓地带锦山郡济源面，从敌人手中夺取了四千余麻袋的粮食，分配给饥寒的农民们。人民游击队的斗争受到各地农民的热烈支持。
    智异山和白云山周围的农民们都热爱人民游击队，他们不惜牺牲性命去协助人民游击队的活动，经常接济他们，救护他们的伤员，侦察敌情。有好几次就是由于农民报告了敌情，人民游击队才避开了敌人的伏击。
    八月会议以后，各地区人民游击队在人民的直接支持下，于四个月之间遍袭居昌、咸阳、长水、茂朱、井邑、顺等二十多个城市，扫荡了傀儡军警驻屯所和无数的警察本署和支署，瘫痪和打乱了敌人广大地区的行政系统。
    在这个期间，人民游击队进行了两千多次爆破铁路、桥梁与截断敌人交通网等的斗争。智勇双全的工兵奇袭组，于九月十三日炸毁京釜线上的秋风岭隧道，瘫痪了敌人的心脏运输。在京釜线和全罗线上，游击队也不断袭击敌人的军用列车。
    穷凶极恶的美国强盗们利用朝鲜停战谈判的时机，以美军第五航空队和装甲部队作先锋，动员了两个师团的傀儡军和警察恐怖团等几十万兵力，在美军的直接指挥下，自一九五一年十二月起，展开了大约七十天的所谓“军警联合讨伐”。
    敌人把游击区一层，两层，三层地包围以后，拼命地向各据点压缩，企图切断游击队的联络和活动。强盗们到处放火，到处杀人。无数无辜的农民都惨死在他们的手下；山野变成了火海，农村变成了废墟。这就是敌人的所谓“焦土战术”。
    在全罗南北道，不过两个月的时间，强盗们就烧掉了六万多户农舍。在这一阵掠夺之后，他们把二十多万老弱农民驱入冰雪的山野。他们企图用极其恐怖的手段割断农民与游击队的联系，因此有一万七千多名农民惨死在杀人犯的枪刀下。据美国国会的一个报告统计：一九五一年十二月份，仅在这一带被枪杀、刺死或活埋的十五岁以下的儿童就有一千六百五十五名，其中不满十岁的幼儿就占九百六十四名。他们又以同样残酷的方法虐杀了五十岁以上的老人一百六十一名。
    李铉相早已预料到敌人会发动这样的攻势。在敌人没有发动攻势以前，他已经把人民游击队分散改编成无数的精锐小组，他们进出于包围网内外，坚决地迎击敌人的疯狂进攻。
    臭名昭著的傀儡国防军的“首都师团”被作为这次“讨伐”的先锋。十二月初旬，其中的一个大队开始向智异山一八一五高地搜索包围。李铉相直接指挥着游击部队，巧妙地诱敌深入最高峰附近的狭谷地带。在那个积雪的狭谷里，人民游击队展开了反包围，把敌人全部歼灭。同时，李铉相更广泛地派遣了大批的宣传组织员深入锦州、光州、和顺等城市和乡村去，继续巩固各地组织，加强宣传工作，打破敌人企图孤立人民游击队的阴谋。
    敌人的“首都师团”在这次“讨伐”中死伤了三千五百多名，傀儡国防军的其他两个师团在今年二月里也被打得溃不成军。他们的尸体满布在曾被他们自己烧光的山野里。强盗们受到了应得的惩罚。
    今年四月四日，李铉相召开了全罗、忠清等道的人民游击队联席会议，到会的有各道党委、各游击队的队长和政委们。大会根据“八月会议”以后的斗争形势，决议加强政治宣传，并且有效地运用分散小组的斗争形式继续广泛地展开斗争。
    战斗在南朝鲜的李铉相人民游击队是一支英雄的部队，人民的部队。他们不仅能百战百胜，而且还在极端困难的条件下，不断地培养干部，用马克思、列宁主义教育全体队员们。智异山区里设有党校、政治学院和民青学院等干部培养机构，大批的青年从各方面吸收进来。因此，他们不仅是一支为正义而战的常胜部队，而且是一支有思想的、在军事上和政治上日益成熟的人民的军队。（原载七月十三日朝鲜“劳动新闻”，马超群摘译）
