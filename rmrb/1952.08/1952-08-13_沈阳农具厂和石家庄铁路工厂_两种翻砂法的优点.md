    The Shenyang Farm Tool Factory's Yang Shoukun innovated the double-scale molding method by reforming the old molding method for sand casting. Following this, Liu Xizhen of the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory created the sweep molding method for sand casting. These two advanced experiences are of great significance and have a significant impact on the development of China's sand casting industry.

    The tools used in Yang Shoukun's double-scale molding method are very simple, requiring only two sandboxes and a pattern plate. His operation involves nailing (or casting) two matching halves of the pattern symmetrically onto both sides of a pattern plate (wood or metal). During molding, a sandbox is placed on each side of the pattern plate, and dowel pins are used to pass through and secure the upper and lower sandboxes and the pattern plate. For molding, the upper sandbox is filled with sand and rammed. The sandbox is then inverted, and the other sandbox is filled. After opening the boxes and removing the pattern plate, the upper and lower sandboxes are joined. The resulting sand mold can then be used for casting.

    Liu Xizhen's sweep molding method requires more tools. In addition to the upper and lower sandboxes, a set of sweep molding mechanisms is needed. The operation of the sweep molding method involves creating a template by digging a hole in the middle of an iron or lead plate according to the pattern's shape, making it a sweep board. The pattern is then fixed on a base plate, and the sweep board is placed on top. A sandbox is placed on the sweep board (both the sandbox and sweep board have tenons), filled with sand, and rammed. When the pattern base plate is lifted and the pattern removed, the sweep board prevents the sand from flowing out, ensuring the sand mold is smooth and complete. While this molding method is more complex than the double-scale method in terms of operation, the pattern removal is easier and less strenuous.

    Compared to the old sand casting methods, these two new sand casting methods have many advantages. First, according to the old sand casting method, the pattern is embedded in the sand mold. When removing the pattern, a layer of water must first be applied, and then pattern drawing pins are nailed to the wooden pattern. The pattern is then carefully tapped with a bar to vibrate it and separate it from the molding sand before the pattern is removed. After the pattern is removed, a mold repair is required. These few procedures often take up a quarter to a half of the total molding time, consuming a lot of time. The double-scale molding method and the sweep molding method, on the other hand, make pattern removal simple and convenient. Second, when the upper and lower sandboxes are closed after removing the pattern in the old molding method, misalignment often occurs, causing the two halves of the pattern to not align completely, resulting in defective products during casting. With the double-scale molding method and the sweep molding method, the sandboxes are positioned when making the sand mold, which can ensure no misalignment and guarantee the quality of the castings. When the Shenyang Farm Tool Factory used the old method for molding, the defective product rate was often between 20% and 30%. After using the double-scale molding method, defective products were eliminated. After the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory used the sweep molding method, defective products were also eliminated.

    Finally, since the old molding method requires meticulous movements when removing the pattern, it requires very skilled workers. The new molding method can overcome some technical limitations. When the Shenyang Farm Tool Factory used the old molding method to make sprayer foot rests, skilled workers of the third grade or above could only make 15 boxes per day. After adopting the double-scale molding method, apprentices could make 50 boxes per day. After the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory used the sweep molding method, work that originally required fifth-grade workers could be done by fourth-grade workers, and efficiency increased by three and a half times. The apprenticeship period can be shortened by half. What is even more important is that the machining departments are now widely promoting high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods, which have rapidly increased processing efficiency. However, when the sand casting methods were still at the old level and production capacity could not keep up with the needs of the machining workshops, Yang Shoukun and Liu Xizhen's advanced experiences in reforming the old molding methods timely solved the problem of improving the production capacity of the sand casting workshops, enabling the balanced development of production in both the sand casting and machining departments.

    Currently, both of these new molding methods still have some limitations in their application and need to be further improved. For example, the double-scale molding method is most suitable for making castings with relatively simple shapes and rounded corners. The sweep molding method is suitable for making castings with more complex shapes and right-angled deep grooves. In addition, the moisture content of the molding sand used in the sweep molding method must be very suitable, because if there is too much moisture, the molding sand will stick to the wooden pattern; if there is too little, the molding sand will easily fall off and damage the pattern.

    沈阳农具厂和石家庄铁路工厂
    两种翻砂法的优点
    沈阳农具厂杨守训改造旧造型法创造了翻砂的双称造型法以后，石家庄铁路工厂刘喜振又创造了翻砂的漏模造型法。这两项先进经验对我国翻砂工业的发展有很大的意义和作用。
    杨守训双称造型法所用的工具很简单，只要两个砂箱和一块模型板。他的操作过程是把两个对半的模型，上下相称地钉（或浇铸）在模型板（木板或金属板）的两面，造型时，在模型板上、下各放一砂箱，再用插销把上、下砂箱和模型板贯穿和固定起来。造型时，把上面的砂箱填砂撞好后，翻转砂箱再填另一个砂箱，然后开箱取出模型板，把上、下砂箱合好，取去砂箱，留下来的砂型就可以浇铸。
    刘喜振的漏模造型法，所用工具较多，除了上、下砂箱外，还有一套漏模机构。漏模翻砂造型法的操作方法，是在一块铁版或铅版的中间，按模型外形挖一孔，做成漏板，另将模型固定在一底板上，用此漏板套在上面，然后将砂箱放在漏板上（砂箱与漏板均有笋头）填砂捣实，等到揭开模型底板取出模型时，漏板挡住了砂子外流，可保砂型光滑完整。这种造型法在操作方面，虽然比双称造型法复杂一些，但在起型的动作方面，却比双称造型法容易而省力。
    这两种新的翻砂法，比之旧的翻砂方法，有很多优点。首先，按照旧的翻砂法，模型是嵌在砂型里的，在起模型时，要先刷一道水，然后用起型针钉在木型上，小心地用棒敲打，震动木型，使它和型砂分离后才取出模型；起型后，还要进行一次修型工作。这几道工序，往往占去全部造型时间的四分之一到二分之一，花费时间很多。而双称造型法和漏模造型法，起型时却很简单方便。其次，旧造型法起型后把上下砂箱合拢起来时，往往发生偏箱现象，使两个对半的模型不能完全吻合，铸造时产生废品。双称造型法和漏模造型法，砂箱在做砂型时即有定位，因而可以保证不偏箱，也保证了铸件的质量。沈阳农具厂用旧法造型时，铸件废品率经常在百分之二十至三十之间，用双称造型法后，消灭了废品。石家庄铁路工厂用漏模造型法后，也消灭了废品。
    最后，旧造型法取出模型时既然需要细致的动作，因此需要很熟练的工人，而新造型法则可突破某些技术上的限制。沈阳农具厂用旧造型法做喷雾器脚登架时，三级以上的技术工人，每天只能做十五箱，采用双称造型法后，徒工每天也能做五十箱。石家庄铁路工厂用漏模造型法造型后，原来需要五级工人作的活，四级工人就可以做了，并提高效率三倍半。学徒年限可以缩短一半。而更其重要的，是目前机械加工部门正广泛地推行高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法，加工效率迅速提高，但翻砂方法还停留在旧的水平上，生产能力赶不上加工车间的需要的时候，杨守训和刘喜振改造旧造型法的先进经验，适时地解决了提高翻砂车间生产能力的问题。使翻砂与加工两个部分的生产，得以平衡发展。
    目前，这两种新的造型法，在运用中都还有某些局限，需要进一步加以改良。例如双称造型法最适于做形状比较简单的和具有圆角的铸件。漏模造型法则适于做形状比较复杂的和具有直角深槽的铸件。此外，漏模造型法所用的型砂的水份必须十分适宜，因为水份多了，型砂就沾木模；太少了，型砂就易掉落，损坏模型。
