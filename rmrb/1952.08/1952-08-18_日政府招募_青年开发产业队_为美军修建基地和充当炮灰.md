Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 15th: The Japanese Yoshida government is recruiting unemployed rural youth in various places to organize so-called "Youth Development Industrial Corps," to make them engage in various kinds of labor constructing military bases and to drive them to serve as cannon fodder for the US military invading Korea.

In order to exploit the large number of unemployed youth in rural areas, the Yoshida government, as early as last year, used the pretext of "developing industry" and "increasing production" to lure them to join the so-called "Youth Development Industrial Corps" or "Youth Production Increase Corps," but in reality, it drove them to engage in various kinds of work constructing military bases and developing power sources. For example, the "Youth Development Industrial Corps" in Yamanashi Prefecture is being used to build dams in order to establish a hydroelectric power station to supply the military industry with electricity; in Kumamoto Prefecture, the "Youth Development Industrial Corps" is being used to develop the foothills of Mount Aso in the prefecture, making it a military base. These deceived unemployed Japanese rural youth are not only being mobilized to build military bases for the US military, but some have already been sent to Korea to serve as cannon fodder for the US military invading Korea. As early as the end of last year, the Kyodo News Agency's correspondent in San Francisco reported that, according to a wounded soldier who returned to the United States from Korea, the so-called Japanese "Youth Production Increase Corps" had already recruited several thousand people, and some of them had been sent to Korea to serve as so-called "mopping-up troops" or "police forces," fighting against the Korean People's Guerrilla Army and guarding roads, supplies, and buildings near the front line.

The Yoshida government is now actively expanding the "Youth Development Industrial Corps." In order to assist in completing the plan to recruit the "Youth Development Industrial Corps," the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has prepared to recruit 500 members in each prefecture and 2,500 members in Hokkaido, and plans to submit a budget of 3.4 billion yen to the Diet as subsidies for the "Youth Development Industrial Corps" for the establishment of training centers and the purchase of equipment.

This measure by the Yoshida government has been criticized by Japanese public opinion. Even the bourgeois newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out: "People should pay attention to the situation of establishing wartime labor service corps and volunteer corps (referring to organizations in which Japanese militarism forcibly engaged youth and teenagers in so-called 'labor service' during the war). It is not necessary to organize this movement to establish the 'Youth Development Industrial Corps' throughout the country, but it must be avoided, and attention should be paid to this totalitarian tendency."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 16th: According to TASS, Tokyo, August 14th: Many news reports in Japanese newspapers mention that the work of militarizing Japan has been increasingly intensified. "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun" wrote that one-third of the 35,000 new recruits of the Japanese "Police Reserve Force" will be trained in the use of tanks. The "Police Reserve Force" will also be trained in the use of anti-aircraft guns. The newspaper admitted that the US warships leased to the "Maritime Safety Agency" are intended for offensive operations.

Under the "Security Agency" there is an aviation department, which is currently studying the issue of using fourteen airfields as air bases.

"Hokkaido Shimbun" wrote that two aviation schools will be established under the "Police Reserve Force" next year.

"Mainichi Shimbun" reported that Japan will establish an association to promote munitions production. The president of this association is Kyogo Kiyoshi, the former president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. This association has about 200 experts in the manufacture of machine guns, cannons, tanks and other weapons. These experts include many former senior engineering officers of the army. "Asahi Shimbun" said: "Eighty-six companies related to arms production have joined the association."

    日政府招募“青年开发产业队”
    为美军修建基地和充当炮灰
    【新华社十五日讯】东京消息：日本吉田政府正在各地招募农村失业青年，组织所谓“青年开发产业队”，使他们从事各种修建军事基地的劳动，并驱使他们充当侵朝美军的炮灰。
    为了利用农村中大量存在着的失业青年，吉田政府早在去年以前就以“开发产业”、“增产”为名，诱骗他们参加所谓“青年开发产业队”或“青年增产队”，而实际上则驱使他们从事各种修建军事基地和开发电源的工作。例如，山梨县的“青年开发产业队”正被用来修筑堤坝，以便建立供给军需工业以电力的水力发电站；在熊本县，“青年开发产业队”被用来开拓该县的阿武隈山麓，使之成为军事基地，这些被欺骗的日本农村失业青年，不单被动员去为美军建设军事基地。而且已有人被送到朝鲜去充当侵朝美军的炮灰。电通社驻旧金山记者早在去年年底就已报道，据一个从朝鲜回到美国的伤兵透露：所谓日本“青年增产队”早已招募了好几千人，他们当中的一部分人已被送到朝鲜去，充当所谓“清剿部队”或“警察部队”，和朝鲜人民游击队作战，并守卫前线附近的道路、供应品和建筑物。
    吉田政府现在正在积极扩充“青年开发产业队”。农林省为了协助完成招募“青年开发产业队”的计划，已经准备在每县招收队员五百人，在北海道招收两千五百人，并计划向国会提出三十四亿日元的预算，作为“青年开发产业队”的补助费，以供建立“青年开发产业队”的训练所和购置装备之用。
    吉田政府这种措置已经遭到日本舆论的抨击。甚至资产阶级报纸“朝日新闻”都指出：“人们应该注意建立那种战时的勤劳奉仕队和义勇队（按系日本军国主义在战时强制青年和少年从事所谓‘劳动服务’的组织）的局面。全国并无必要组织这种建立‘青年开发产业队’的运动，而是必须予以避免，并应该留意这种极权主义的倾向。”
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社东京十四日讯：日本报纸上的许多新闻都提及日本军国主义化的工作已日益加紧。“产业经济新闻”写道：日本“警察后备队”的三万五千名新兵中有三分之一将受使用坦克的训练。“警察后备队”还要受使用高射炮的训练。该报承认租借给“海上保安厅”的美国军舰是打算用于攻势作战的。
    在“保安厅”下有一个航空部，该部目前正在研究将十四个飞机场当作飞机基地使用的问题。
    “北海道新闻”写道：明年将在“警察后备队”下面成立两个航空学校。
    “每日新闻”报道，日本将成立一个促进军火生产的协会。这个协会的会长为三菱重工业公司前社长乡古洁。这个协会约有两百个制造机关枪、大炮、坦克和其他武器的专家。这些专家中包括许多从前的陆军高级工兵军官。“朝日新闻”说：“和军火生产有关的八十六家公司都参加了这个协会。”
