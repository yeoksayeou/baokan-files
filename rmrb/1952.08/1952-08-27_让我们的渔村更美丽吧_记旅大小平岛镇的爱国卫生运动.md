    Let's Make Our Fishing Village More Beautiful
    —A Record of the Patriotic Health Campaign in Xiaopingdao Town, Lushun-Dalian
  　Wen Er　Zuo Feng
    Taking the Lushun-Dalian southern route bus, about 20 miles out of Dalian, one can see a narrow peninsula stretching into the sea. Over 500 households reside on the island, the majority of whom are fishermen. Because of its beautiful scenery, it has always been known as one of the eight scenic spots of Lushun-Dalian.
    However, despite its beautiful natural environment, the sanitary conditions of Xiaopingdao Town have always been poor. Everyone in the town says that it used to be a very dirty place. Filth could be seen everywhere, whether on the streets or the coast. Garbage and clam shells accumulated over a century were scattered all over, and fish and shrimp water was everywhere. As for every corner of the wall, it was not only overgrown with weeds, but also frequently found with feces. In the summer, the fishy smell accompanied by the stench, coupled with the buzzing flies, made it impossible to approach.
    But today, this fishing village has undergone a fundamental change. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the fishermen worked hard to catch fish, and their lives have improved. The town mayor told us that soon after the patriotic health campaign was launched, when the residents understood the importance of hygiene, they took action one after another. Half of the village's population participated in the hygiene training classes to learn hygiene knowledge, even many old ladies in their sixties and seventies. They knew that paying attention to hygiene was not only good for themselves, but also a patriotic action. From the road to the coast, men and women, young and old, worked together, and in three days, they filled over 500 carts of garbage and clam shells, accumulated over a century, into the sea. They repaired the roads and squares, and cleared all the dirt. They fenced up all the chickens and ducks, and everyone agreed not to spill fish and shrimp water everywhere. Even the large pond behind the village was sprinkled with disinfectant every few days, eradicating the breeding of mosquito larvae.
    The enthusiasm of the fishermen in participating in the patriotic health campaign is indescribable. Everyone was a participant in the movement. For example, Grandma Lü Guixiang, who is 79 years old, did not want to fall behind, so she spent three days making a wooden cage to catch mice. If there were horse carts without manure covers and vendors without fly-proof equipment, they couldn't even think of coming to the street. If anyone's chickens and ducks ran out, even the children could offer their opinions. We walked into the streets and alleys, into any square, and could not see any filth. Not only were the streets swept very clean, but even the corners of the walls were no longer found with excrement, and even weeds were rare.
    We visited several families and deeply felt how great the changes brought to the fishermen by the patriotic health campaign were! Walking into the courtyard of Qiao Shufen, the leader of the model hygiene team—the 20th hygiene team, we first saw a basin of clear water placed next to the door, and next to it were towels and soap. Her mother told us that their family members not only washed their hands before meals and after using the toilet, but also washed their hands at any time after picking up something or finishing work. For this reason, they specially set up a place to wash their hands here. Walking into the inner room, we saw another strange thing: on a bright and clean coffee table, there was a porcelain pot: the pot was filled with boiling water, but the spout was covered with a paper cover. Perhaps our surprise attracted the owner's attention, Qiao Shufen smiled and explained to us, "We don't have a thermos, so we use a teapot to hold boiling water, but we are afraid that dust will fall into it from the spout, so we cover it with a paper cover!" Then she told us that they have to uncover the kang mat every morning and clean the kang once; the quilt is almost sunned every day; and the floor is rinsed with water every week. The provisions in the patriotic pact, such as sunning the quilt once every three days, changing the shirt twice a week, and washing hair and trimming nails frequently, have become the living system of their whole family.
    Guided by the hygiene team leader, we visited more than a dozen households in the group. It seemed that every family was very clean, and most of them achieved the degree of "clean windows and bright tables, spotless." You can even touch the wires and the cabinets and boxes with a picky eye, and there is no dust at all; as for the kang and the floor, it's just like it was just swept. In the kitchen of Qiao Chuanlong's family, Grandma Qiao, who is almost 60 years old, showed us a gauze frame. The gauze frame covered the food, and the top was covered with two layers of gauze. Grandma Qiao said, "It is true that flies cannot fly into the gauze, but perhaps fly droppings will fall into it, so I covered it with another layer, which is safer."
    Perhaps some people will say: This is a model hygiene team, it is natural for them to do well in hygiene. Then, let's take a look at the home of farmer Wang Jianxin. This is a very ordinary family. When we went there, it was about 5:30 in the afternoon, and Aunt Diao Lanfang, who is 56 years old, had already prepared dinner. Why did she make dinner so early? It turns out that her three children often need to take a bath. Especially in the summer, they wash more frequently, almost once a day. So she has to make dinner early every day to prepare to bathe the children. She told us, "The children are used to washing, if sometimes they are not given a bath, as soon as it gets dark, one by one they clamor: 'I want to take a bath, I want to take a bath'." Therefore, she is often forced to make dinner early. In addition to bathing the children, she has another job - washing the ducks. This is not done by her personally, but every few days she drives the ducks to the sea to wash. For the toilet, which is the most unsanitary place, she scrubs it with water every day. Of course, this is only part of her work, but it can be seen that she is a very hygienic person!
    When we went to visit the home of the stall vendor Meng Zhaoxing, who had always been considered the "dead corner" with the worst hygiene, we were even more surprised: because his sanitary condition was also so good. It turns out that this old man Meng Zhaoxing is a temple keeper, and he is the most superstitious in the town. If anyone has a headache or fever, he will ask the gods for help; the grease on the walls of his house has been shining for decades, and he never touches it. But the patriotic health campaign broke his superstition. After he repeatedly heard some hygiene knowledge, he finally made up his mind to improve hygiene. He asked someone to paint the walls with white lime and moved the earthen stove outside; the house and yard were cleaned every day. Not only that, but even the carrying pole for selling goods was brushed with seawater every few days, and he also prepared gauze, sleeves, and masks. When selling sweets and snacks, he did not use his hands, but used clips instead.
    Shi Xiangyun, the director of the Women's Federation, told us: "Due to the launch of the patriotic health campaign, many living habits of the masses have also undergone unprecedented changes. In the past, in the summer, even adults walked barefoot, but now even children wear shoes; in the past, people generally drank cold water, but now they drink boiled water instead. For example, Grandma Liu, who is 61 years old, after the launch of the patriotic health campaign, found a jar and a small bowl, and she used them to serve boiled water for her family to drink.
    This change also happened on the ship, on the bodies of the people fishing at sea. In the past, many people thought that "fishermen cannot pay attention to hygiene," "mixing with fish and shrimp all day long, no matter how clean they are, they can't wash away the fishy smell." But today, the situation is completely different. We met fisherman Wang Zhaoming in the village. He was wearing a set of half-new blue uniforms and a blue hat, and we could not smell any fishy smell on him. Until he introduced himself, we realized that he was originally a person who had just returned from fishing. He said: "We not only pay attention to hygiene at home, but also pay attention to hygiene on the boat. In the past, fishing boats were not brushed for many days, and the fishy smell could be smelled from a long distance. Now, we go out to sea twice a day, and we have to brush the boat twice; as soon as the fish is unloaded, we wash it with seawater. When fishing at sea, we also have to cover the fish with sacks to avoid flies. In this way, the flies on the boat have been greatly reduced, which ensures the hygiene of the fish." He also told us that now, every time he comes back from fishing, he must first wash his body with seawater, and after going ashore, he changes into a new set of clothes. Therefore, the fishy smell that he had thought he could not wash away for many years is gone. In fact, not only is he personally like this, but many fishermen are like this. And the most common phenomenon is: they also bring boiled water to drink when they get on the boat; the phenomenon of throwing fish intestines on the beach like in the past is gone. Because everyone knows that this is very detrimental to public health, so now every time they cut fish intestines, they bury them with soil or transport them to the ocean and throw them away. In the past, many fishermen urinated and defecated on the coast after getting off the boat, but now this situation is no longer visible.
    Because of this, the incidence of diseases here has been greatly reduced. According to the town mayor's estimate, in previous summers, due to eating fruits indiscriminately and drinking raw water, more than 60% of the fishermen suffered from diarrhea. This year, they went out to investigate and found only a few, less than 1% of the town's residents. The benefits brought by the patriotic health campaign to the people of the fishing village are endless. Let us carry out the patriotic health campaign in depth, so that our lives will be happier and our fishing village will be more beautiful!

### 让我们的渔村更美丽吧——记旅大小平岛镇的爱国卫生运动

    让我们的渔村更美丽吧
    ——记旅大小平岛镇的爱国卫生运动
  　文尔　左烽
    乘上旅大南线公共汽车，出大连二十里，人们便可看见一个狭长的半岛，伸入海面。岛上共住着五百多户人家，其中绝大部分是渔民。由于它的风景幽美，因此一直被称为旅大八景之一。
    可是，尽管它的自然环境多么美丽，小平岛镇过去的卫生状况却一向不好。镇上的每一个人都说，这里原是个很肮脏的地方。无论在大街或海岸，都可看到污秽。积存达百余年的垃圾、蛤蜊壳散布四处，鱼水虾汤到处皆是。至于每个墙角，那就不仅是杂草丛生，还经常发现粪便。夏天一到，腥味伴着臭味，再加上那嗡嗡乱飞的苍蝇，使人无法走近。
    但是如今，这个渔村却发生了根本的变化。渔民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，努力捕鱼，生活好了。镇长告诉我们：开展爱国卫生运动不久，当居民们知道了讲卫生的道理后，便纷纷地行动起来。全村有一半人口参加了卫生训练班，学习卫生常识，连许多六、七十岁的老太太也参加了。他们知道：讲卫生不仅对自己有好处，而且也是一种爱国行动。从马路到海岸，男女老少一齐动手，用三天的时间，将积存百余年的五百余车垃圾和蛤蜊壳，全部填到海里去。他们修补了马路、广场，将所有脏物全部清除。把鸡鸭全部圈起来，大家都相约不再乱泼鱼水虾汤。连村后的大水塘，也隔几天就撒消毒水，根绝了孑孓的繁殖。
    渔民踊跃地参加爱国卫生运动的情况，是无法形容的。谁都是运动的参加者。譬如说：七十九岁的吕桂香老大娘，自己不甘落后，花费了三天时间做了一个木笼捉耗子；如果有不带粪兜的马车和没有防蝇设备的小贩，他就休想到街上来；谁家的鸡鸭要跑出来，连小孩子也能给他提出意见。我们走进大街小巷，走进任何一个广场，都看不到污秽。不仅街面上扫的非常清洁，就连墙角里也再见不到大小便，甚至连青草也很少了。
    我们访问了几个家庭，深深感到：爱国卫生运动给渔民带来的变化是多么巨大！走进模范卫生组——第二十组卫生组长乔淑芬家的院子，我们首先看见门旁放着一盆清水，旁边是手巾、胰子，她的母亲告诉我们：他们家的人不仅在饭前便后洗手，即拿了什么东西，或干完活之后，也都随时洗手；为此，他们专门在这儿设立了一个洗手的地方。走进里屋，我们又看到一件奇怪的东西：在一张擦得明亮的茶几上，放着一把瓷壶：壶里盛着开水，但壶嘴上却套了一个纸套。也许是我们的惊异引起了主人的注意，乔淑芬就笑着对我们解释说：“我们没有暖壶，就用茶壶盛开水，但又怕从壶嘴里掉进灰尘，所以才用纸套上！”接着她又告诉我们：他们每天早晨都要揭开炕席，把炕打扫一次；被，几乎是天天晒；地，每星期都用水冲刷。爱国公约上订的：三天晒一次被，一星期换两次衬衣，以及常洗头、剪指甲等条文，已经成为他们全家的生活制度。
    由卫生组长做向导，我们又走访了该组的十多户人家。看来家家都很洁净，大部做到“窗明几净，一尘不染”的程度。任你去挑剔地摸摸电线，摸摸柜箱，灰尘是根本没有的；至于炕上、地下，那简直就像刚扫过似的。在乔传隆家的厨房，快到六十岁的乔老大娘指给我们一个纱布架看。纱布架罩着饭菜，盖上面覆着两层纱布。乔老大娘说：“盖上一层纱布苍蝇固然飞不进去，可是说不定苍蝇屎会掉进去，所以我又盖了一层，这才保险。”
    也许有人会说：这是模范卫生组，他们卫生搞的好是自然的事。那么，我们再看看农民王建新的家。这是一个很平常的家庭，我们去时是下午五点半左右，五十六岁的刁兰芳大娘已经把晚饭做好了。为什么她把饭做得这样早呢？原来是：她家的三个孩子，经常要洗澡。特别是夏天，洗的更勤，差不多一天一回。所以她每天都得把饭早早做好，准备给孩子们洗澡。她告诉我们：“孩子洗惯了，如果有时不给他们洗，一到傍黑，一个个就嚷嚷着：‘我要洗澡，我要洗澡’。”因此常常逼得她不能不早做饭。除了给孩子洗澡，她还有一件工作——就是给鸭子洗澡。这倒不是她亲自动手，而是隔几天她就把鸭子赶到海里去洗。对于最有碍卫生的便所，她每天用水刷一遍。当然，这还只是她工作的一部分，不过由此可以看出：她是个很讲究卫生的人！
    当我们去访问了一向被人认为卫生最不好的“死角”——摊贩孟兆兴家时，我们更加惊异：因为他的卫生状况也是那样良好。原来这孟兆兴老人是一个看庙的，在镇里最迷信不过，谁要是有点头痛脑热的病，他就去求神告佛；他家的墙上几十年的油灰都发了亮，他从不去触动一下。但爱国卫生运动打破了他的迷信思想，当他反复地听到了些卫生常识后，也终于下了决心，也要把卫生搞好。他求了一个人，把墙刷上了白石灰，把土炉挪到外边；家里、院子天天打扫。不仅如此，连卖货的担子也隔几天就用海水刷一次，自己又备置了纱布、袖套、口罩，卖糖果、点心时，都不用手拿，改成用夹子夹了。
    妇联主任史湘云告诉我们：“由于开展了爱国卫生运动，群众的许多生活习惯，也发生了从未有过的变化。从前每到夏天，连大人都光着脚走路，而现在连孩子都穿上鞋；从前人们普遍喝凉水，而现在改喝开水了，例如六十一岁的刘老大娘在爱国卫生运动展开后，就找了一个坛子，一个小碗，由她盛开水给家人喝。
    这个变化也发生在船上，发生在海上打鱼的人们的身上。在过去，许多人认为“渔民不能讲卫生”，“一天到晚和鱼虾在一起混，管怎么干净，也洗不掉腥味”。但是今天，情形却完全不同了。我们在村里碰到渔民王兆明，他身上穿着一套半新的蓝制服，戴着一顶蓝帽，从他身上闻不到一点腥味。直到他自我介绍时，我们才知道：他原来是一个打鱼才回来的人。他说：“我们不仅在家里讲卫生，在船上也同样讲卫生。过去渔船多少日子也不刷，那股腥臭味隔老远都能闻到。现在，我们一天出两回海，便要刷两回船；只要鱼卸完了，我们便用海水冲一遍。在海里钓鱼时，我们也要用麻袋把鱼盖上，以免落上苍蝇。这样一来，船上的苍蝇大大减少了，使鱼的卫生也得到了保证。”他还告诉我们：现在，每次打鱼回来，他必先用海水把身上洗一遍，上了岸后，他就再换一套新衣。因此多年认为洗不掉的腥味也没有了。事实上，不仅他个人如此，许多渔民都是这样。而最普遍的一个现象是：他们上了船，也同样带着开水喝；像过去那样把鱼肠子扔到海滩上的现象也没有了。因为大家都知道：这样很有碍于公共卫生，因此现在每当割鱼肠子时，就用土埋起来，或者用船运到海洋里扔掉。过去有很多渔民，下船之后在海岸上大小便，现在这种情形根本看不见了。
    正因为如此，所以这里的疾病已大大减少了。据镇长估计，往年夏天，由于乱吃水果和喝生水，渔民总有百分之六十以上患泻肚病，今年他们四出调查，却只发现很少几个，不到全镇居民的百分之一。爱国卫生运动给渔村人民带来的好处，是说不完道不尽的。让我们将爱国卫生运动深入开展起来，使我们生活更幸福，让我们的渔村更加美丽吧！
