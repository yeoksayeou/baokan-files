Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 7th: Following the conclusion of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, peace organizations and peace-loving people in India are enthusiastically launching a campaign to nominate delegates and actively prepare for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing in September this year.

More than twenty newspapers across India have prominently published the full text of the declaration of the preparatory meeting. Professor Kosambi, the chief Indian delegate to the preparatory meeting, held a press conference upon his return and wrote an article entitled "Striving for Peace in Asia and the Pacific Region, Striving for World Peace," which was widely published in many newspapers and periodicals across India. Indian delegates Yannick and Singh, upon their return, gave detailed reports on the preparatory meeting to the Indian people at several public gatherings in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Delhi. Romesh Chandra, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-India Peace Council and Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, is also writing a weekly column reporting on the preparatory work. These reports and articles have received widespread attention from people of all walks of life. In Delhi, many important representatives from various fields with different party affiliations and viewpoints have expressed their willingness to support the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

India has now established the Indian Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, with its headquarters in Delhi. The Preparatory Committee held a meeting on July 30th. Members of the Preparatory Committee include representatives from various progressive groups in Delhi and many members of parliament from various parties and factions, including three members of parliament from the Congress Party, Communist Party of India representatives Gopalan and Helen Mukerji, Workers and Peasants Party representative More, and Socialist Party parliamentary leader Mrs. Kripalani, and others. The Preparatory Committee has decided to designate the week from August 3rd to 10th as "Asia Week," and August 10th as "Asia Day," specifically to widely publicize the significant meaning of convening the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. In addition, the Preparatory Committee decided to convene launching meetings in most provinces across India at the end of August to discuss various issues and select delegates to attend the All-India launching meeting. The All-India launching meeting will be held in Delhi in early September, at which time a broadly representative delegation from India to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will be elected. These decisions and calls of the Preparatory Committee have been warmly responded to and supported by trade unions, peasant organizations, student federations, and women's associations across India, as well as the broad masses of the Indian people.

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: Jakarta News: Under the leadership of the Indonesian National Peace Committee, the broad masses of the Indonesian people are actively preparing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing in September.

Representatives of the Indonesian National Peace Committee and other organizations held a meeting on July 27th and formally established the Indonesian Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, responsible for promoting preparatory matters. The Preparatory Committee elected Sidik Tabahti, Member of Parliament from the Indonesian Farmers' United Front, as Chairman, ethnic entrepreneur Apin Tonga as Vice Chairman, Nasution and Shaing, Chairmen of the Indonesian National Peace Committee, as Secretary-Generals, and nineteen other members. The Preparatory Committee decided to hold a peace exhibition in Indonesia during the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

The Indonesian National Peace Committee also selected Pastor Utosia to participate in the preparatory work for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Utosia departed from Jakarta on July 5th and arrived in Beijing on July 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: TASS, Karachi, June 6th: The "Sind Observer" reported that Shakur, a member of the Executive Committee of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, issued a statement on the tasks of the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Shakur, who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in China, recently returned home. In his statement, Shakur said that the people of Pakistan can contribute to peace as long as they oppose any rearmament plans and refuse to allow their armed forces to be used for any war of aggression. Shakur said, "If peace in the Asian and Pacific region is guaranteed, it will be a great contribution to world peace."
