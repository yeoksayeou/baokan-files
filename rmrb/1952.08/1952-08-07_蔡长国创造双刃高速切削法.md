    Cai Changgui Creates Double-Edged High-Speed Cutting Method
    Cai Changgui, deputy leader of Group One in the Sixth Workshop of the Tenth Machinery Factory, created an advanced working method of "one cut, two edges, multiple clamping" in high-speed cutting when machining tap milling cutters. The characteristic of this working method is to modify the single-edged lathe tool for the outer circle of the tap milling cutter into two edges. At the same time, using a milling machine mandrel to clamp six milling cutters at a time, and implementing high-speed cutting, the spindle speed is increased from 55 revolutions per minute in the past to 150 revolutions per minute, and the cutting speed is increased from 61 meters per minute in the past to 183 meters per minute. It can save the country wealth equivalent to 6.2 tons of grain per day.
    Inspired by Cai Changgui's creation of double-edged cutting, Ma Dianliang then created a double-edged milling cutter for drill bits. This workshop is vigorously promoting this experience to form a double-edged cutting upsurge. Zhao Baoqi

    蔡长国创造双刃高速切削法
    机械第十厂第六车间车工一组副组长蔡长国，在车丝锥铣刀的时候，创造了在高速切削当中用“一刀二刃多卡活”的先进工作法。这个工作法的特点，是把丝锥铣刀外圆的单刃车刀改做两个刃。同时，利用铣床蕊胎连卡六个铣刀，并实行高速切削，使主轴转数由过去的每分钟五十五转提高到一百五十转，切削速度由过去的每分钟六十一公尺提高到一百八十三公尺。一天能给国家节省价值六点二吨粮食的财富。
    在蔡长国创造双刃切削的启示下，马殿良接着创造出双刃车钻头铣刀的工具。这个车间正在大力推广这个经验，以形成双刃切削高潮。赵宝祺
