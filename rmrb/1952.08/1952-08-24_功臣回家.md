    Hero Returns Home
    Cháng Róng
    Han Linxiang is a driver in the motor transport team of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He is from Beijing and a member of the Communist Party. On the Korean front, he demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, driving safely for 20,000 *li* under constant air raids to ensure the supply of military needs. He was awarded a first-class merit and a military medal from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    In July, he returned to China on official business and took the opportunity to visit his long-separated home. The changes in his home surprised him. His elder brother had become an outstanding Grade A worker at the Beijing Telephone Bureau’s Fifth Bureau and an Grade B labor model of the Beijing Telephone Bureau. His sister-in-law was a street representative, a member of the Public Security Committee, a leader of the sanitation team, and a member of the district epidemic prevention committee. His little nephew had also started school and could sing "The East is Red." He curiously touched his uncle's gun, saying innocently, "Second Uncle, I want to go with you to fight the American devils!" The old grandmother, who loved Linxiang the most, was comforted by her grandson's plump and tall physique, smiling incessantly with tears of joy rolling down her wrinkled face. After a long while, she uttered one sentence: "Chairman Mao's army is truly strong and powerful!"
    The residents of the courtyard welcomed this hero of the people as if he were their own relative. Family woman Hu Guangxi had only moved here for over a year and had not met Linxiang. She knew that the volunteer army was fighting to protect her happy life, so she usually treated Linxiang's grandmother like her own elder, often washing her clothes, taking apart her quilt, cleaning her house, and sometimes helping her cook. This time, she was even happier when Linxiang returned. She washed Linxiang's clothes clean and also helped her husband (a cook) cook meals to welcome the people's hero. Zhang Jiuzhou, sixty-nine years old (who used to be a car driver himself), enthusiastically asked Linxiang to repeatedly tell him combat stories, inquiring whether he could still go to Korea to do transportation work.
    While Han Linxiang was at home, his commendation for merit happened to be mailed from Korea. On July 31, the people of the Third District of Beijing held a grand meeting at the Sanyi Elementary School playground to announce and celebrate Han Linxiang's meritorious service and that of his family. Before the meeting, people crowded the nearly two-mu-large playground, and the surrounding walls and houses were full of people. Everyone was talking about this good news, and everyone felt excited and proud that their district had produced a hero of the people. When Han Linxiang appeared in the crowd, the sound of firecrackers and applause interrupted people's conversations, and everyone scrambled to see their hero. Chen Minghao, a nine-year-old student at Sanyi Elementary School, gave a speech at the meeting saying, "Please, Uncle, return to the Korean front and tell those uncles who haven't come here: the children of the motherland love you, support you, and we are all learning from the fighting spirit of the uncles!"
    Amidst the thunderous applause of the masses, Han Linxiang told everyone his combat stories. "One night, we had to complete a transportation mission of 300 kilometers. The American aerial bandits continuously dropped more than 30 flares, followed by a barrage of machine-gun fire. I immediately turned off the lights and asked my assistant Jiang Jintu to peer out of the car to discern the direction of the enemy plane from the landing point of the flares. Seeing the enemy plane twist its rear, I immediately increased the horsepower and sped forward using the light of the enemy's flares. When we arrived at Qiuchuanli, the enemy plane fired blindly at us again and chased us for more than 40 *li*. Seeing that the situation was not right, I stopped the car suddenly, letting the enemy plane go ahead. Then, with a sharp turn, I plunged into the woods beside the road. The enemy plane circled above the woods for several laps, dropping four bombs for nothing and firing seven bursts of machine-gun fire, then slipped away..." Han Linxiang's speech was frequently interrupted by the applause of the masses.
    After the meeting, people flocked to Han Linxiang's home, asking him to sign their diaries and to continue telling combat stories.
    The love and respect of the people of the motherland for Comrade Han Linxiang added new fighting strength to him. He told reporters: "The love of the people of the motherland for me far exceeds my contribution to the people of the motherland. During the two weeks of my stay at home, almost every day five or six people came to see me, even old ladies in their seventies and young children in their seven or eight years old. Many people wanted me to sign autographs for them. My handwriting is very bad, but I signed for more than three hundred people. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where would I have received such honor!" When he returned to Korea, he carefully carried a plaster statue of Chairman Mao with him, which was a gift of sympathy given to his family by a trade union group this year on "August 1st" Army Day. Han Linxiang said: "I want to strive for more and greater victories for the people of the motherland under the supervision of Chairman Mao!"

    功臣回家
    长荣
    韩林祥是志愿军某部汽车运输队的司机，北京人，共产党员。在朝鲜前线上，他发挥了高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，在不断的空袭下安全行车二万华里，保证军需供应，立了一等功，并荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的军功章。
    七月间，他因公回国，顺便回到久别的家中探望。家中的变化引起了他的惊奇。哥哥已经成为北京市电话局第五局的甲等优秀工作者和北京市电话局乙等劳动模范；嫂嫂当了街代表、治安委员、卫生组长和区防疫委员会的委员；小侄子也进了学校，会唱“东方红”了。他好奇地摸着叔叔的枪，天真地说：“二爹（叔叔），我跟你去打美国鬼子！”最疼爱林祥的老祖母从孙孙的又胖又高的体格得到了安慰，只是合不住嘴地笑，热泪不时滚在带有皱纹的脸上。她半天才说出一句话：“毛主席的队伍真是兵强马壮啊！”
    同院的居民像招待自己亲人似地欢迎着这位人民的功臣。家庭妇女胡广喜才搬到这里一年多，没有和林祥见过面。她知道志愿军在为保卫她的幸福生活而战斗，平常就把林祥的祖母当做自己的老人一样看待，经常替她洗衣服、拆被子、打扫房子，有时还帮助她做饭。这次林祥回来，她更乐了。她把林祥的衣服洗得干干净净，还帮助自己的丈夫（厨工）做饭，欢迎人民的功臣。六十九岁的张九洲（过去他也是汽车司机）热情地请林祥给他反复讲述战斗的故事，探询着自己是否还可以到朝鲜去作运输工作。
    韩林祥在家的时候，碰巧他的立功喜报从朝鲜寄回来了。七月三十一日，北京市第三区人民在三义小学的操场上举行了向韩林祥及其家属报喜贺功的大会。开会以前，人们拥挤在将近两亩大的操场上，周围的墙壁上和房子都站满了人。大家都在交谈着这个喜讯，每个人都为自己区内出了人民功臣而感到兴奋和骄傲。韩林祥出现在人群中时，鞭炮声和鼓掌声打断了人们的谈话，大家都争着要看看自己的功臣。三义小学九岁的学生陈明浩在大会上献词说：“请叔叔回到朝鲜前线，告诉那些没有来的叔叔们：祖国的孩子热爱你们，支援你们，我们都在学习着叔叔们的战斗精神！”
    韩林祥在群众的雷动掌声中给大家讲述自己的战斗故事。“有一夜，我们要完成三百公里的运输任务。美国空中强盗一连投下三十多枚照明弹，跟着照明弹就是一排机关枪。我马上灭了灯，叫助手蒋近徒探头到车外，从照明弹落下来的地方判清敌机正扭转了屁股，我马上加大了马力，借着敌人照明弹的光向前飞驶。到了秋川里，敌机又向我们盲目地射击，并且直追了我们四十多华里。我看来势不对，车猛一停，就把敌机让到前面去了。随着来了个大转弯，钻到路旁的树林里去。敌机在树林上面盘旋了好几圈，白送了四枚炸弹，打了七排机关枪，溜走了……。”韩林祥的讲话，不时为群众的掌声打断。
    散会后，人们都蜂拥到韩林祥的家里，要他在自己的日记本上签字，要他继续讲战斗故事。
    祖国人民对韩林祥同志的热爱和尊敬，给他增添了新的战斗力量。他对记者说：“祖国人民对我的热爱远超过我对祖国人民的贡献。我在家停留的两个星期中，几乎每天都有五、六个人来看我，连七十多岁的老太太和七、八岁的小学生也来看我，有许多人要我签名留念。我的字写得很坏，但我给三百多人签了名。要不是共产党和毛主席，我从那里会得到这样的荣誉！”他返回朝鲜时，把一个毛主席的石膏塑像小心翼翼地带在身上，这个石膏像是今年“八一”节一个工会小组送给他家的慰问品。韩林祥说：“我要在毛主席的督促下，给祖国人民争取更多更大的胜利！”
