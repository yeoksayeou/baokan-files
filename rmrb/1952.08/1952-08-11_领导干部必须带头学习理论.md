    Leading Cadres Must Take the Lead in Studying Theory
    Currently, the theoretical study of in-service cadres nationwide has gradually begun in the Northeast, North China, and Northwest regions, and the general cadres are very enthusiastic about learning. In this study movement, the leadership of leading cadres plays a significant role. For example, the advanced cadre study group organized by the Northeast Bureau, headed by Comrade Gao Gang, has greatly promoted the study movement in the Northeast. However, some places still do not fully recognize the importance of leading cadres taking the lead in learning. We recently received a letter from a reader from the Subei Administrative Office, who passionately proposed strengthening learning in light of the impending large-scale construction, and then painfully stated the adverse phenomena caused by their leaders' lack of concern for learning. He said: "In the office, our leading comrades are caught up in the busy circle of work day and night. Not to mention helping comrades learn, even the level of the leading comrades themselves is limited. The new undertaking is so complex, scientific, and precise, but our leading comrades originally did not study, and now they have no time to study. This situation is serious. As for the learning of general cadres, it has not received the necessary guidance and attention. The political study every morning often becomes formalism, without leadership, without a plan. Every time it is time to study, everyone sits together and chats nonsense, sometimes it is as difficult to speak as squeezing toothpaste. Even comrades with high enthusiasm for learning get headaches at the study meeting and would rather read a book by themselves." He also said: "There is an argument here that unilaterally emphasizes 'learning in work'. However, if we do not study theory and do not build our cause on a scientific theoretical foundation, this is very dangerous. Below, due to the lack of learning, the tendency of not asking about politics and the old working methods are very common. For example, in the Shuyang County Farm and the local township government, because the cadres did not study Chairman Mao's 'Get Organized' well and did not understand the direction of the development of New Democratic agriculture, phenomena such as mutual aid groups buying land, hiring workers, and lending money at usurious rates are very common in the high-yield village they jointly cultivated. The county farm only focuses on technical guidance and does not feel these phenomena, and some comrades in the district committee even said: 'There is no problem with mutual aid groups hiring workers'. There are also old-fashioned phenomena in the promotion of technology in the farm. District and township cadres say that they feel worried when they hear about high yields, feeling that the leadership is at a dead end and there is no way out." It can be seen that improving the political theory learning of in-service cadres is not only related to future construction work, but is also urgently needed at present.
    The situation described in the letter from the reader in Subei is what we must prevent and overcome. Conversely, we must promote the spirit of the cadres of the Northeast Industrial Department studying today. The study of senior cadres in the Northeast Industrial Department directly led to improvements in work. It improved the theoretical level of senior cadres themselves, and thus also improved the level of work. As pointed out in the circular of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "The theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industrial Department has indeed solved many problems in their own work in the past two years, which is also an important gain from their study." It clarified the thinking of leaders, thereby unifying the thinking of general cadres. For example, regarding the issue of the factory director responsibility system in Northeast industry, initially many cadres had inconsistent ideas, so of course they could not fully consciously accept the work. Later, after study, incorrect ideas were corrected, and the planning of work was significantly improved. Another example is the issue of industrial investment. Initially, all departments raised issues from their own local needs. Later, because leading cadres educated cadres to grasp the main contradictions in their study of "On Contradiction," cadres in all units corrected their views of not taking care of the overall situation, and unified their understanding and pace.
    The leading study of senior cadres can quickly form a learning atmosphere, making it easier to establish a learning system, and the problems in learning are also easier to solve. The experience of theoretical study by senior cadres of the Northeast Industrial Department shows that the study of senior cadres, especially leading cadres, is one of the important links in promoting the study of in-service cadres. Leading cadres in various regions should accept the experience of the Northeast Industrial Department and strengthen their own study to lead the study of all cadres.

    领导干部必须带头学习理论
    目前全国在职干部的理论学习已逐渐在东北、华北、西北等区展开，一般干部的学习情绪都很热烈。在这个学习运动中，领导干部的带头是有重大作用的。如东北局以高岗同志为首所组织起来的高级干部学习组对于东北的学习运动就起了很大的推动作用。但是有些地方对于领导干部带头学习的重要意义仍然认识不足。我们最近收到一封从苏北行署寄来的读者信件，他热情地提出了在大规模建设即将到来的今天必须加强学习之后，随即沉痛地申述他们的领导同志如何不关心学习所造成的不良现象。他说：“在机关里我们的领导同志，朝夕陷于工作忙乱的圈子里，不要说帮助同志们学习，就是领导同志本身水平的提高也受了限制。新的事业是这样复杂和富于科学性、精确性，可是，我们的领导同志原来便没有学过，现在又没有时间学习。这种情况是严重的。至于一般干部的学习，更是没有受到必要的指导和重视。每天早上的政治学习，经常成为形式主义，无领导，无计划，每到学习时间大家坐在一起瞎扯，有时就像是挤牙膏式的难于发言。甚至学习情绪高的同志，到了学习会上也头痛，宁愿自己一个人看看书。”他又说：“我们这里有一种论调，就是片面强调‘在工作中学习’。可是，我们如果不学习理论，不将自己的事业建筑在科学的理论基础上，这是很危险的。在下面，由于缺少学习，不问政治的倾向和老一套的工作方法是很普遍的。例如，在沭阳县农场和当地乡政府，由于干部没有很好学习毛主席的‘组织起来’，不了解新民主主义农业发展的方向，以致在他们共同培养起来的丰产村里，互助组买田、雇工、放高利贷的现象很普遍。而县农场只偏重技术指导，对这些现象无所感觉，区委有的同志甚至说：‘互助组雇工没问题’。在农场推广技术方面，也存在老一套的现象。区乡干部说，听到丰产便发愁，感到领导是走头无路，没办法。”由此可见，提高在职干部的政治理论学习，不仅关系到今后的建设工作，即在眼前也是迫不及待的。
    像苏北读者来信所说的这种情况是我们所必须防止与克服的。反过来，我们必须提倡今天东北工业部干部学习的精神。东北工业部高级干部的学习直接引起了工作上的改进。它提高了高级干部本身的理论水平，因而也提高了工作水平。正如中共中央东北局通报所指出的：“工业部高级干部理论学习，两年多以来确曾解决了他们自己工作中的许多问题，这也是他们学习的重要收获。”它明确了领导者的思想，从而也就统一了一般干部的思想。如东北工业中关于厂长负责制的问题，起初许多干部思想是不一致的，这样当然就不能完全自觉地接受工作，后来经过学习，纠正了不正确的思想，工作的计划性就有显著的提高。又如工业投资问题，起初各部门都从自己局部需要来提问题，后来由于领导干部在学习“矛盾论”中，教育干部要抓住主要矛盾，使各单位干部都纠正了自己不照顾全局的观点，而统一了认识，统一了步调。
    高级干部的带头学习，能够迅速形成学习的风气，使学习制度容易建立，学习中的问题也容易解决。东北工业部高级干部理论学习的经验，说明了高级干部，特别是领导干部的学习，是推动在职干部学习的重要环节之一。各地领导干部都应该接受东北工业部的经验，加强自己的学习，以带领全体干部的学习。
