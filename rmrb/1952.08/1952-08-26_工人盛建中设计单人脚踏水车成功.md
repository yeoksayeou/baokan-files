    Worker Sheng Jianzhong Successfully Designs Single-Person Treadle Waterwheel
    Editor: Sheng Jianzhong, a technician at the public-owned Xinhua Factory in Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, and a provincial industrial labor model, saw that the old-fashioned waterwheels in rural areas required three or four people to tread, which was very strenuous. He wanted to improve the old waterwheel. His idea immediately received support from his superiors. With the cooperation of the workers, after continuous research and experimentation, he finally designed a lightweight waterwheel that saved three-quarters of the manpower compared to the old waterwheel. The farmers praised this waterwheel for being well-made.
    The structure of the new waterwheel is very simple. Make a square wooden frame 38 inches high and 34 inches wide. Install two flywheels on both sides of the wooden frame (each 32 inches in diameter, 130 catties in weight, 5 inches in thickness and outer circumference width, filled with gravel). Connect the two wheels with a bent axle (48 inches long, 11 minutes in diameter) and install it on the horizontal bar in the middle of the wooden frame; the bent axle is 15 inches from the ground; below the bend of the bent axle, install an iron hook pedal, and then connect the wooden gear on the bent axle (10 inches in diameter) with the wooden gear (30 inches in diameter) installed on the head axle of an ordinary waterwheel; shorten both ends of the ordinary waterwheel axle, and install it in the middle of the front two vertical columns of the square wooden frame with a ball bearing ring (the height is the same as the bent axle). This completes the process. The principle of this waterwheel is to use the power generated by the rotation of the two flywheels to drive the waterwheel, so as long as one person lightly steps on the waterwheel pedal, the waterwheel can be brought up.

    Editor's note: The principle of the single-person treadle waterwheel designed by Sheng Jianzhong is roughly the same as the principle of the single-person treadle waterwheel trial-produced by Zhao Luoyao, a farmer from Lincheng County, Hebei Province, and Peng Wanyi and Liu Renbiao, farmers from Hengshan County, Hunan Province. This kind of waterwheel can also be promoted. Sheng Jianzhong's spirit of caring about agricultural production and actively modifying waterwheels to help farmers solve production difficulties is very good.

    工人盛建中设计单人脚踏水车成功
    编辑同志：浙江桐庐县公营新华厂技工、省工业劳动模范盛建中看到农村的旧式水车需要三、四个人踏水，很费气力，就想把旧水车改良一下。他的意见立即得到上级的支持。他在工人们的配合之下，经过不断的研究和实验，终于设计出比旧水车省四分之三的人力的轻便水车。农民们都称赞这种水车造得好。
    新水车的构造很简单。做好一个高三十八吋，阔三十四吋的方木架，木架两边装上两只飞轮（每只直径三十二吋，重一百三十斤，厚度及外围圈阔度都是五吋，内装满石子），用弯地轴（轴长四十八吋，直径十一分）贯连两轮，装置在木架中腰横档上；弯轴离地面十五吋；在弯轴的弯肚下部，装上一个铁钩踏板，再把弯轴上的木齿轮（直径十吋）与普通水车车头轴上装置的木齿轮（直径三十吋）互相搭起来；把普通水车车轴的两头截短，用弹子圈装在方木架的前两根直柱中腰（高度与弯轴同）上。这样就成功了。这种水车的原理是利用两只飞轮旋转所发生的力量来带动水车，所以只要一人轻轻踏动水车踏板，就可以把水车上来。

    编者按：盛建中设计的单人脚踏水车的原理和河北临城县农民赵洛耀，湖南衡山县农民彭文一、刘仁标所试制的单人脚踏水车的原理大致相同。这种水车也可以推广。盛建中关心农业生产，积极改制水车帮助农民解决生产困难的精神是很好的。
