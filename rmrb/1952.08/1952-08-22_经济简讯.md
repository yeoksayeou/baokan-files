    The North China Region has purchased 26.6% of its annual wheat procurement plan.
    As of July 15th, the amount of wheat purchased by state-owned grain companies and cooperatives in the North China region had reached 26.6% of the annual procurement plan. Hebei province performed better, while Shanxi province lagged. This year, state-owned grain companies and cooperatives in the North China region divided their labor in wheat procurement. Grain companies controlled the main markets in larger towns, while cooperatives were responsible for the primary markets in smaller towns and rural areas. This approach took care of all aspects and also focused on the key areas of procurement. In terms of procurement volume, grain companies and cooperatives in various regions accommodated the wheat purchasing needs of private merchants and the masses. For example, in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces, the procurement volume of grain companies and cooperatives in larger towns accounted for 80% of the wheat on the market; the procurement volume in the primary markets accounted for 70%, with the remainder purchased by private merchants and farmers.
    Shandong farmers are actively engaged in capturing and eliminating autumn locusts.
    Under the slogan "Capturing and eliminating autumn locusts means a good harvest," Shandong farmers are actively mobilized to capture and eliminate autumn locusts. Since mid-to-late July, autumn locusts have appeared in more than 20 counties in six special districts, including Tengxian, Tai'an, Zibo, Jiaozhou, Huimin, and Dezhou, affecting an area of more than 450,000 mu. Most of the affected areas are in reed marshes near lakes and coastal areas, with Tengxian special district being the most severely affected. After discovering locust nymphs, Party and government leading organs in various regions immediately mobilized farmers to capture and eliminate them. The People's Governments in areas with severe locust infestations in Tengxian special district have now organized locust control command structures at all levels. The Shandong Provincial Institute of Plant Protection and the Xuzhou Locust Control Station have dispatched experts and technicians to areas with dense autumn locust populations to guide farmers in capturing and eliminating them. In Tengxian special district, 130,000 farmers are participating in locust control, and in Zibo special district, more than 17,000 farmers are engaged in locust control daily. In Pei County, Tongbei and other counties that are more seriously affected by locusts, nearly 100,000 farmers have been concentrated in the deep reed marshes with dense locust nymphs, cutting grass in a planned manner while spraying "666" powder and throwing medicated bait. In less than five days, locust nymphs have been eliminated in an area of more than 100,000 mu.
    The production and market trading of major industrial products in Shanghai are better than in the same period last year.

According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the city's commodity circulation volume in May reached 100.27% of that in January this year, and in June it exceeded January by 11.86%, also exceeding June of last year by 8.4%.

June exceeded January this year by 25.48% and exceeded the same period last year by 20.4%. The operating rate and output of private factories are also constantly increasing. In June, the number of factories in operation accounted for 90%. The output of Shanghai's major industrial products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, flour, paper, gold pens, electrolytic copper, wire nails, matches, and soap all increased compared to the same period last year. The situation for private commerce has also improved rapidly, with turnover increasing month by month in May and June, and the situation in July is even better. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau, the output of taxed industrial products mostly exceeded June, with flour exceeding by 73%, laundry soap by 50%, automobile tires by 245%, and enamel washbasins by 16%. According to a typical survey of seven medium-sized cotton cloth stores, the turnover in the first ten days of July increased by 34.3% compared to the last ten days of June. The improvement in the native product industry is even more significant.

    华北区收购小麦已达到全年收购计划百分之二十六点六
    华北区国营粮食公司和合作社收购小麦的数量，到七月十五日止已达到全年收购计划的百分之二十六点六。其中河北较好，山西较差。今年华北区国营粮食公司收购小麦时，和合作社进行了分工，粮食公司掌握较大城镇的主要市场，合作社负责小城镇和农村初级市场。这样就照顾了全面，又掌握了收购重点。在收购量的比重上，各地粮食公司和合作社都照顾私商和群众的购麦要求。如河北、平原两省粮食公司和合作社在较大城镇中的收购量共占上市小麦的百分之八十；在初级市场的收购量占百分之七十，其余都为私商和农民购买。
