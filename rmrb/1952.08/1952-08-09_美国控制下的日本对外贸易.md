Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 22nd: The "Pravda" correspondent in Tokyo, Koren, wrote: Japan's foreign trade once showed some improvement, but it has been declining since this spring. According to the most optimistic estimates of local observers, Japan's exports this year will only be equivalent to half of last year's, not to mention being far behind pre-war levels.

Textiles, one of Japan's important exports, mainly cotton textiles, are also under threat. Cotton textiles shipped by sea in May decreased by one million yards compared to April. From May to June, Japan's silk exports decreased by a quarter. In just one month, steel exports decreased from 281,000 tons to 69,498 tons. Exports of pig iron, non-ferrous metals, machinery, and light industrial products have decreased significantly. The warehouses of Japanese factories and merchants are filled with manufactured goods that cannot be sold. Bank managers are racking their brains trying to protect their loans from the impact of borrowers going bankrupt. Banks had recklessly lent 1.5 billion yen to some companies.

Why is Japan's foreign trade so weak? Koren answers this question by saying: Japan's slave-like dependence on the United States, and the extremely bad influence it has on the Japanese economy, especially on Japan's foreign trade, has now become apparent. The fact that Japan's exports dropped sharply shortly after the entry into force of the separate treaty once again proves that American imperialists are not only using this treaty to prepare for another war, but also to further enslave Japan.

Under the guise of so-called "special procurement orders," the United States continues to ship goods, raw materials, and fuel urgently needed by Japan abroad for the Korean War. The United States pays prices for goods under "special procurement orders" that are lower than domestic and export prices in Japan.

The obligations imposed on Japan by the so-called "Japan-US Economic Cooperation Plan" force Japanese industries to purchase expensive American raw materials.

In order to better control the economy of this occupied country, the United States promised to lend money to Japanese state-owned and private manufacturers. This money quickly returned to American merchants with huge profits. However, in order to repay their debts, Japanese factory owners must, on the one hand, reduce the prices of export goods to seek profits, and on the other hand, intensify the exploitation of workers.

Koren continued to write: Since Japan's foreign trade is under the control of the United States, it has become a tool for the United States to expand its market in Southeast Asia. However, in Southeast Asia, Japan's exports have encountered desperate resistance from Britain, which is eager to maintain its position in Southeast Asia. The influx of cheap Japanese goods has forced Britain to adopt more effective methods than ordinary competition. Under British coercion, Malaya, Thailand, New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan, Burma, and other countries have stopped or almost stopped importing Japanese goods. This measure has significantly affected Japan's foreign trade and has had an adverse impact on Japan's entire economic life. The production index has begun to decline. Government loans to support threatened business sectors have worsened the already strained financial situation and increased the unbearable burden on the Japanese working people.

Koren pointed out: Most Japanese merchants firmly demand an opportunity to develop international trade relations, especially trade relations with China. Manufacturers and merchants raised these demands at their gatherings and meetings. They established a Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference. This movement by business people has been supported by Japanese progressive groups, because this movement is in line with Japan's vital interests and the goals of free and independent development of the Japanese economy.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 23rd: Kyodo News reported: According to statistics from the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board, in the past two years, the United States' so-called special procurement orders (military supplies ordered by the United States for its aggression against Korea) in Japan have reached 645,864,000 US dollars.

    美国控制下的日本对外贸易
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科七月二十二日讯：“真理报”驻东京记者科仁写道：日本对外贸易一度有些起色，但是在今年春天以来一直在衰落。据当地观察家最乐观的估计，日本今年的出口将仅仅相当于去年的一半，不用说，自然更大大落后于战前的水平。
    日本重要输出品之一的纺织品，主要是棉织品，也受到了威胁。五月份由海船外运的棉织品比四月份减少了一百万码。从五月到六月，日本外销的丝减少了四分之一。仅仅在一个月之内，钢铁的输出从二十八万一千吨减少到六万九千四百九十八吨。铣铁、有色金属、机器和轻工业品的出口大大减少了。日本工厂和商家的仓库堆满了无法销出的制成品。银行经理们绞尽脑汁想法使他们放出的贷款不受借款者破产的影响。银行曾经轻率地拿出十五亿日元贷给某些公司。
    日本的对外贸易为什么这样疲弱不堪呢？科仁回答这个问题说：日本像奴隶一样依附美国，对于日本经济特别对于日本对外贸易产生的极为恶劣影响，现在已经表现出来。单独和约生效后不久，日本的输出就急剧下降，这个事实再度证明美帝国主义者不仅利用这个和约来准备另一次战争，而且还要进一步奴役日本。
    在所谓“特需订货”的伪装下，美国继续把日本急迫需要的货物、原料和燃料运出国外以供朝鲜战争之用。美国支付“特需订货”的货物的价格低于日本国内和出口的价格。
    所谓“日美经济合作计划”强加于日本的义务，硬使日本工业购买价格高昂的美国原料。
    为了更好地控制这个被它占领的国家的经济，美国答应贷款给日本国营和私营制造商。这些钱很快地带着巨额利润回到了美国商人手里。但是，日本厂主为了清偿债务，就必须一方面削减出口货的价格以谋取利润，另一方面愈益加紧对工人的剥削。
    科仁继续写道：日本对外贸易既然已在美国的控制之下，就变成了美国在东南亚扩大市场的工具。但是，在东南亚，日本的出口货遇到了极欲在东南亚保持地位的英国的拚命抵制。日本廉价货物的进攻使英国不得不采取比普通的竞争方式更为有效的办法。在英国的强迫下，马来亚、泰国、新西兰、澳大利亚、巴基斯坦、缅甸及其他一些国家，已经停止或差不多停止了输入日本货物。这个措施显著地影响了日本的对外贸易，并对日本整个的经济生活发生了不利的影响。生产指数已开始下降。政府为了支持受到威胁的企业部门而给予的贷款使紧张的金融局势愈益恶化，并且加重了压在日本劳动人民身上的难以忍受的负担。
    科仁指出：大多数日本商人坚决要求给他们一个发展国际贸易关系的机会，特别是与中国的贸易关系。制造商和商人在他们的集会和会议上提出了这些要求。他们成立了一个日中贸易促进会议。企业界人士的这个运动得到了日本进步团体的支持，因为这个运动符合于日本的切身利益，符合于日本经济的自由与独立发展的目标。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社东京七月二十三日电：共同社报道：根据日本经济安定本部的统计，两年来美国在日本的所谓特需订货（美国为侵略朝鲜而订购的军用品）已达六亿四千五百八十六万四千美元。
