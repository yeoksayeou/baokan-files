    Northwest Institute of Technology Graduates
    Determined to Dedicate All Their Strength to the Motherland's Industrialization
    Respected Chairman Mao: We are a group of young people about to embark on the motherland's industrial construction. With boundless, profound, and sincere enthusiasm, we report our joy and determination to you.
    In the three years since liberation, we have, through study and political movements, raised our political consciousness and love for the motherland. On the eve of our taking up our posts, the Government Administration Council issued instructions to place us in the most appropriate jobs. This vivid fact makes us feel even more deeply the Party's care for us young people, and the glory and happiness of young people in the Mao Zedong era!
    Since birth, we have lived in the old society amid turbulent and uneasy sounds of gunfire. Being deprived of education, unemployment, and displacement constantly threatened us. Our deeply painful past experiences make us cherish today's happiness and strengthen our determination to strive for a better tomorrow.
    Chairman Mao: Our motherland is so vast and expansive, with so many resources and treasures waiting to be developed and utilized. The prospects for our motherland are just as the martyr Fang Zhimin said: "Everywhere is active creation, everywhere is progress changing with each passing day... Bright gardens will replace desolate wastelands!... And the mother who gave birth to us will also be most beautifully decorated..." Thinking of these things fills us with joy and excitement as we are about to participate in the motherland's industrial construction!
    Respected Chairman Mao: We solemnly assure you: We will resolutely obey the motherland's assignments and serve the people wholeheartedly. We will humbly learn from our worker comrades, improve our class consciousness and professional skills, and work tirelessly for the industrialization of the motherland and the socialist future!

    西北工学院本届毕业生
    决心为祖国工业化而献出一切力量
    敬爱的毛主席：我们是一群即将投入祖国工业建设事业的青年。我们怀着无比深厚、真挚的热情向您报告我们的欢乐和决心。
    解放后三年来，我们在学习和政治运动中，提高了政治觉悟和对祖国的热爱。在我们走上工作岗位的前夕，政务院发布指示，要把我们放在最适当的工作岗位上。这个生动的事实，使我们更深刻地感到党对我们青年的关怀，感到毛泽东时代青年的光荣和幸福！
    我们出生以来，在旧社会中，一直是在动荡不安的炮火声中过日子。失学、失业和流亡经常威胁着我们。过去灾难深重的遭遇，使我们更加懂得珍惜今天的幸福和争取更美好的明天的决心。
    毛主席：我们祖国是多么辽阔广大，多少富源宝藏在等待着开发和利用。我们祖国的远景，正像方志敏烈士所说的：“到处都是活跃跃的创造，到处都是日新月异的进步，……明媚的花园，将代替了凄凉的荒地！……而生育我们的母亲，也会最美丽地装饰起来……。”一想起这些，我们为即将参加祖国工业建设而感到欢愉和激动！
    敬爱的毛主席：我们庄严地向您保证：我们坚决服从祖国分配，全心全意为人民服务。我们要虚心向工人同志学习，提高阶级觉悟和业务水平，为祖国的工业化和社会主义的前途而不倦地工作！
