    Capital "August 1st" Night

    As night fell, hundreds and thousands of people in Beijing flocked to the People's Stadium to celebrate the joyous "August 1st" Army Day evening with representatives from the People's Liberation Army and the returning representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's sports and art delegations.

    The dazzling colored neon lights illuminated the square in a riot of colors, and the red five-pointed star at the top of the flagpole sparkled in the night sky. Commander-in-Chief Zhu's inscription, "Train yourselves to become men of iron constitution and defend our most beloved country," radiated golden light under the lights.

    "The evening party begins!" Fireworks burst forth in the center of the square, and colorful sparks streaked across the night sky. Thunderous applause and cheers erupted from the crowd.

    After the fireworks, the dancing began. Tens of thousands of spectators cheered and rushed onto the field from the stands like a tide. Music was broadcast from the loudspeakers, and tens of thousands of feet leaped and danced, transforming the wide square into a sea of ​​boiling humanity.

    The heroes and model workers of the People's Liberation Army, wearing their hero medals, and the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, wearing the "Resist America, Aid Korea" commemorative medals on their chests, became the center of attention for tens of thousands of people. Groups of young men and women warmly shook hands with the soldiers, and everywhere you could hear: "Comrade, let's dance!" Representatives of the Air Force in black flight suits and students in white formed a circle, while representatives of the Southwest Military Region in ethnic minority dance costumes were surrounded by Young Pioneers wearing red scarves. The music from the loudspeakers constantly changed, and the formations on the dance floor also constantly changed. Standing on the stands and looking down at the entire scene, one could only see a sea of dancing flowers.

    People enthusiastically celebrated this great festival and revelled until late at night.

    首都“八一”之夜
    当夜幕降临的时候，北京市成百成千的人群涌进了人民体育场，与解放军各代表队和志愿军归国代表团的体育、文艺代表们欢度“八一”节的愉快之夜。
    耀眼的各色霓虹灯把广场照得千紫万红，旗杆顶上的红五星在夜空中闪烁着。朱总司令的题字：“锻炼自己成为铁的体质，保卫我们最可爱的国家”，在灯光下放射着金色的光辉。
    “晚会开始了！”广场中心焰火齐放，五彩的火花划破了夜空。人群里响起了雷动的掌声和欢呼。
    焰火过后，舞蹈开始了。上万的观众欢呼着，从看台上像潮水一样地奔向场上。扩音器播送出乐曲，千万只脚跳跃着，宽阔的广场变成了一片沸腾的人海。
    佩带着英雄奖章的解放军的英雄模范们，胸前挂着抗美援朝纪念章的志愿军代表们，成了万人环绕的中心。群群的男女青年们，热情地握住战士们的手，到处可以听到：“同志，我们来跳舞吧！”穿着黑色飞行衣的空军代表和穿着白衣的学生围成一圈，穿着少数民族舞衣的西南军区代表，又被戴着红领巾的少年儿童队围住，扩音器里不断变换着乐曲，舞场上也不断变换着队形。立在看台上俯瞰全场，只见一片花朵舞动。
    人们热烈庆祝这伟大的节日，一直狂欢到夜深。
