    A Brief Review of Cultural Life

    The song "I am a Soldier," published today, won first prize in the singing category of the "August 1st" Army Day Sports Meet's literary and artistic competition. The works that won first and second prizes alongside it, "The Spoken Words of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area" and "Soldier's Home," have already been published in the "Resist America, Aid Korea Special Edition" of this newspaper on the 10th of this month. Other winning songs and vocal performances will also be published in this newspaper successively.

    These singing programs, as well as the dance programs that won prizes in the competition, attracted the audience of the conference and were enthusiastically loved by soldiers, cadres, and the masses alike. They were also praised by musicians, dancers, and artists. The achievements of the troops' mass literary and artistic activities are significant.

    The common characteristic of these works is that they reflect the fighting life of the soldiers, express the heroic spirit and revolutionary optimism of the soldiers, and they have a strong combativeness and mass character.

    "I am a Soldier" is an outstanding mass song, concise and powerful, with full and strong fighting emotions. With concise words, it generalizes, but by no means conceptually, the characteristics of the people's army and its glorious history. The lyrics, through the voice of a soldier, express our army's determination to oppose aggression and defend peace, demonstrating their vigorous fighting spirit and belief in victory. The lyrics are easy to understand, and the tune is appropriately and closely combined with the content of the lyrics. This song has been universally appreciated by the participants of the conference, and it was already popular among some troops and the masses. It will undoubtedly gain even wider circulation in the future.

    "The Spoken Words of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area" is a single-string ballad written and performed by combat hero Wang Fengming. The successful creation by a soldier of such a work with the theme of praising the great construction projects of New China demonstrates the breadth of thought of our troops, the breadth of their vision, and that they are not only engaged in combat and consolidating national defense, but also concerned with all new things and the construction of the motherland. The use of folk art forms familiar and loved by the broad masses of the people, its lively and humorous and friendly language, as well as the use of metaphors, exaggerations, and personification, are one of the elements of the success of this ballad. The author's imagination is rich, and he skillfully depicts the construction of a project and the local natural environment without being boring. He introduces the huge scale of the project and its function to the audience in a general and vivid way. It can be believed that, after the author's performance, an ordinary farmer will also understand the general situation of the project and its significance in economic construction. The author's hatred and satire of the old society, his praise of the new society, his love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and his feeling of pride and pride in the great strength of the Chinese people, are all vividly conveyed from the lyrics.

    The above are just two examples.

    The successful creations participating in the literary and artistic competition all have similar characteristics. They come from the rich soil of life, are filled with the lively thoughts and feelings of the masses, and are connected to the tradition of national art and literature, while being full of creativity.

### 部队创造了好的群众文艺作品

    部队创造了好的群众文艺作品
    今天刊载的“我是一个兵”这一首歌，得到了“八一”建军节体育运动大会文艺竞赛中歌唱节目的一等奖。和它同时分别获得一、二等奖的作品荆江“蓄洪区说话”、“战士之家”，已发表在本月十日本报“抗美援朝专刊”上，另外还有一些得奖的歌曲和演唱作品也将陆续在本报发表。
    这些歌唱节目以及同时在竞赛中得奖的舞蹈节目，吸引了此次大会的观众，为战士、干部和群众所一致热烈爱好，也受到了音乐家、舞蹈家和文艺家的称赞。部队的群众文艺活动的成绩是很大的。
    这些作品的共同的特色是它们反映了战士的斗争生活，表现了战士的英雄气概和革命的乐观主义精神，它们具有强烈的战斗性和群众性。
    “我是一个兵”是一首杰出的群众歌曲，简洁有力，具有饱满的强烈的战斗情绪。它以简练的词句，概括地，却决不是概念化地，说出了人民军队的特质和它的光荣历史。歌词通过一个战士的口吻，表达了我们军队的反对侵略、保卫和平的决心，表现了他们的旺盛的斗志和胜利的信念。歌词通俗易懂，曲调恰当地紧密结合着词的内容。这首歌受到了大会参加者的普遍的赞赏，它原已在一部分部队和群众中流行，今后无疑将获得更加广泛的流传。
    荆江“蓄洪区说话”是战斗英雄王凤鸣自编自唱的一篇单弦唱词。战士成功地创作了这样一首以歌颂新中国伟大建设工程为主题的作品，表明了我们的部队的思想的广阔，他们的眼界的宽大，他们不仅从事着战斗和巩固国防，也关心着一切新事物和祖国的建设事业。它所采用的为广大人民所熟悉和爱好的民间文艺形式，它的明快的诙谐的和亲切的语言，以及比喻、夸张和拟人法的运用，是这首词的成功的要素之一。作者的想像是丰富的，他巧妙地把一个工程的建设和当地的自然环境，毫不枯燥地描画了出来，他既概括又形象地向听众介绍了这个工程的巨大规模及其作用。可以相信，经作者这样一唱，一个普通农民也会了解这个工程的一般情况和它在经济建设上的意义。作者对旧社会的憎恨和讽刺，对新社会的歌颂，对党和毛主席的爱戴，以及中国人民的伟大力量而感到自豪和骄傲的心情，都生动地从唱词中传达了出来。
    以上仅仅是两个例子。
    参加文艺竞赛的成功的创作，都具有这种相类似的特色。它们是从丰富的生活土壤中来的，是充满了群众的生龙活虎般的思想感情的，它们是联系着民族文艺的传统，而又富于创造性的。
