    Heroic Port on the Coastal Defense Line - Wonsan
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporters Cheng Yi and Zhao Pu

    We visited the heroic port of Wonsan, standing on the east coast of Korea. This, the second largest city in North Korea, is known as the "Korean Sevastopol" in the struggle against American aggression.

    The struggle of this heroic city is a glorious epic. As early as October of the previous year, when the enemy landed in Wonsan, the people of Wonsan cooperated with their own troops in a heroic seven-day and night defense. The American invading army lost more than 3,000 men before temporarily occupying the city. During the two and a half months of enemy occupation, blood-stained Wonsan did not yield. The guerrillas organized and led by the local Labor Party waged a tenacious struggle against the enemy in the streets and suburbs until their own troops re-entered Wonsan. After that, the people of Wonsan cooperated with the troops to repel four enemy landing attempts.

    From February of last year to today, the enemy has not given up its aggression against Wonsan and its delusion of landing there. Looking east from the mountains, one can see the gray enemy ships emerging and disappearing in the vast ocean, and at night one can clearly see the fire from the enemy ships' gunports. Enemy ships and planes dump tons of steel on the city every day, the city is filled with smoke, and the sound of explosions never ceases. The enemy has repeatedly arrogantly declared that Wonsan is a "dead port," but Wonsan is alive, it is alive and fighting. Korean and Chinese People's forces guard this heroic city, monitoring the turbulent sea with huge cannons, and frequently engaging in fierce artillery battles with enemy ships appearing in the distance; the heroic air defense forces guard the sky, using sudden and fierce shooting to punish American aerial bandits, enemy planes often crash into the ocean trailing smoke; powerful infantry forces guard the front lines day and night, and have repelled many enemy landing attempts.

    In the smoke-filled city, the Korean people work tensely and calmly on the land filled with bomb craters: line repairmen climb onto telephone poles to repair the wires; female police officers calmly direct vehicles rushing in all directions. The heroic people of Wonsan have shattered the enemy's conspiracy with their own fighting and labor, standing like a steel giant, with their chests out, in front of the enemy.

    In the years of arduous struggle, the people of Wonsan have united into a strong whole under the goal of "Defending the City, Defending the Coastal Defense." The fighting has not only defeated the enemy, but also tempered the people. Everyone here has become a veritable veteran. As soon as the air raid siren sounds, pedestrians on the ground quickly enter the basement, the crowded market immediately becomes empty, leaving only the disciplinary team members faithfully guarding the goods. After the enemy planes wreak havoc, medics with red cross armbands rush from all directions to the bombed areas, and women and children repair the bombed bridges and roads in the smoke. The youth, women, elderly, children, poets, and writers of Wonsan City have all joined various organizations needed for the war, mobilized to serve the war, and everyone is fighting heroically.

    In August of last year, the enemy dispatched dozens of warships and nearly a hundred planes to launch a landing invasion of Wonsan. The Wonsan City Committee of the Korean Labor Party and the Wonsan City People's Committee immediately issued a battle call, and the people of the city took up various weapons and solemnly swore to General Kim Il-sung: We will not allow the enemy to occupy an inch of land, and we will fight to the end to defend Wonsan! The City Democratic Youth League organized the city's youth into a youth team to cooperate with the troops in guarding the city, some rushed to the front line to fight alongside the defending troops; the workers insisted on production while dispatching a large number of manpower to transport ammunition to the front line; the rescue team organized by the Women's League rescued and transported the wounded on the front line; the elderly also used hoes and shovels to help the defending troops dig trenches; the children helped carry mud and wood in the trenches. The people of the city cooperated with the defending troops to fight fiercely with the enemy for seven days and nights, and finally sank four enemy ships, shot down ten enemy planes, and repelled the enemy's attack.

    Touring along the bullet-scarred city of Wonsan, one is immediately shocked by the strong labor and iron will of the people of Wonsan. They have moved almost the entire city of Wonsan underground. People have overcome many difficulties and used arduous labor to build factories, schools, hospitals, theaters, nurseries, canteens and homes underground. Before the war, Wonsan had seventeen primary schools, ten middle schools, and five or more specialized schools. Now, in addition to the four specialized schools, the rest are still in session, and a nursery has also been established to house four hundred homeless children. The four hospitals are treating and rescuing the wounded every day. State-owned stores and consumer groups are supplying the items needed by citizens. The "Gangbuk Daily," which sells 12,000 copies a day, is also published as usual, and the radio station sets up the broadcaster on the street to broadcast the good news of victory to the people of the city. The underground cinema is showing newsreels of the heroic struggle of the people of Wonsan and films of the defense of Stalingrad during the Soviet Patriotic War. The underground theater performs short plays depicting the Republic hero Heo Eul-ryong sinking two enemy ships in the defending troops and the dance of Republic hero Bae Gyeong-ho shooting down thirteen enemy planes. These films and dramas reflecting combat and life are regarded by the people as part of their struggle life. The people of Wonsan said in a firm tone: "Learn from the heroes of Stalingrad!"

    The female workers of a certain textile factory carried heavy machine parts to the rear before the enemy once occupied Wonsan; after Wonsan was liberated, they immediately returned to install and repair the machines, and personally built new workshops on the ruins. Four female workers were killed by shells while carrying wood. The workers buried the bodies of their companions and immediately continued the construction work, and finally resumed production within half a month. In order to supply the frontline soldiers with the need for vegetables, the elderly cultivated green vegetables on the ruins, and some elderly people also collected bomb fragments from the rubble every day with crutches and gave them to the country to make guns and cannons to fight the enemy. The children helped the guerrillas cut off enemy wires and collect enemy intelligence when the enemy occupied Wonsan. Now, they also do their best to serve the motherland. The students of Wonsan Municipal No. 1 Middle School collected two and a half tons of scrap iron for the country in half a year, and planted 210,000 trees. They also organized ten consolation evenings for the defending troops and wrote more than two hundred letters of consolation in two months. Writers and playwrights formed a mobile troupe and performed for the soldiers in the front lines at the risk of artillery fire. Shin Heung-soon, secretary-general of the Gangwon-do Arts Alliance, won the Republic's Third-Class National Flag Medal last year for creating two plays that inspired the people's fighting spirit.

    The destruction of Wonsan by the American aggressors is something that the people of Wonsan will never forget. On the wall of the underground office of Kang Lee-seop, the principal of Municipal No. 2 Middle School, hangs a huge map of the school: the school was originally built on the seaside, with tall and beautiful buildings shaded by green trees. However, it is now a ruin, with only a few bare trunks lying beside the dense bomb craters. This old educator in his fifties pointed to the school map and said:

    "Let me and the children look at it every day, and always remember who destroyed our school!" He has been engaged in education for more than 30 years. During the Japanese occupation, he was imprisoned for opposing the Japanese ban on teaching Korean. After the "August 15" liberation of Korea, he helped the government establish this school and loyally educated the new generation. After the American air pirates bombed his school, he organized the students to transport equipment, dig caves, move the school underground, and insist on teaching. He is now planning to send more than 40 graduating students to various combat positions to defend the motherland. The people of Wonsan are defending their city with such an unwavering fighting will and a high degree of confidence in victory. Their struggle demonstrates a truth to the people of the world: "The people are unyielding."

### 海防线上的英雄港——元山

    海防线上的英雄港——元山
    新华社记者  成一  赵普
    我们访问了屹立在朝鲜东海岸上的英雄港——元山市。这座北朝鲜第二大城，在反抗美国侵略的斗争中，被称为：“朝鲜的塞瓦斯托波尔”。
    这座英雄城市的斗争，就是一部光辉的史诗。远在前年十月间敌人在元山登陆时，元山的人民就曾经配合自己的部队进行了七昼夜英勇的保卫战。美国侵略军损失了三千多人，才暂时侵占了这个城市。在敌人占领的两个半月中，血染的元山并没有屈服。当地劳动党所组织和领导的游击队在街巷和市郊同敌人进行了顽强的斗争，一直到自己部队重新进入元山。在这之后，元山人民又配合部队击退了敌人四次登陆进攻。
    从去年二月到今天，敌人没有放弃过对元山的侵犯和从那里登陆的妄想。登山东望，可以看见出没在浩瀚海洋里的灰色敌舰，入晚可以清晰地看见敌舰上炮弹出口的火光。敌舰和敌机每天都将整吨的钢铁向这座城市倾泻，市区里弥漫着硝烟，爆炸声终日不绝。敌人曾屡次狂妄地宣称元山已是“死港”，但是，元山是一直活着的，它活着而且战斗着。朝、中人民部队守卫着这座英雄的城市，用巨大的炮口监视着波涛滚滚的海面，经常和在远处出现的敌舰展开猛烈的炮战；英勇的防空部队警备着天空，用突然的猛烈的射击来痛惩美国空中强盗，敌机常常拖着烟尾巴跌到海洋里；强大的步兵部队日日夜夜守卫在前哨阵地上，他们曾击退了敌人多次的登陆进攻。
    在硝烟弥漫的市区里，朝鲜人民在布满着弹坑的土地上紧张、镇定地工作着：修线工人爬到电线杆上修复着电线；女警士沉着地指挥着奔向各方的车辆。英勇的元山人民用自己的战斗和劳动粉碎了敌人的阴谋，像一个钢铁的巨人，挺着胸膛站在敌人面前。
    在艰苦战斗的岁月中，元山人民在“保卫城市、保卫海防”的目标下，团结成了一个坚强的整体。战斗，不仅击败了敌人，而且锻炼了人民。这里的每一个人都成了名符其实的老兵。空袭警报一响，地面上的行人就迅速地进入地下室，人群拥挤的市场立即空旷起来，只剩下纠察队员忠诚地看守着货物。等到敌机施虐以后，带着红十字臂章的救护队员从各处迅速地奔向被炸地点，妇女和儿童在硝烟中抢修着被炸毁的桥梁和道路。元山市的青年、妇女、老人、儿童和诗人、作家都参加了各种战争所需要的组织，动员起来为战争服务，每一个人都在英勇战斗。
    去年八月，敌人出动了数十艘兵舰和近百架飞机，在元山发起登陆进犯。朝鲜劳动党元山市委员会和元山市人民委员会立即发出战斗的号召，全市人民都拿起各种武器，遥向金日成将军庄严地宣誓：不让敌人侵占一寸土地，誓为保卫元山而战斗到底！市民主青年联盟将全市青年组织成一支青年队，配合部队警戒市区，有的奔赴火线，与守备部队并肩作战；工人们一面坚持生产，一面抽调大批人力向火线上运送弹药；妇女同盟组织的救护队在火线上抢救和运送伤员；老人也拿着洋镐铁锹紧张地帮助守备部队挖掘战壕；儿童们在战壕里帮助搬运泥土和木料。全市人民配合守备部队与敌人激战了七昼夜，终于击沉了四艘敌舰，击落了十架敌机，打退了敌人的进攻。
    沿着元山市弹痕累累的市区巡行，人们就立刻为元山人民坚强的劳动和钢铁的意志所震惊。他们几乎将整个元山市都迁入了地下。人们克服了重重困难，用艰巨的劳动在地下建筑了工厂、学校、医院、剧院、养育院、食堂和住宅。战前，元山有十七所小学，十所中学和五所专科以上的学校，现在除了四所专科以上的学校外，其余都在照常上课，并且还设立了一所养育院，收容四百名无家可归的儿童。四所医院，每天都在治疗和救护着伤员。国营商店和消费组在供应着市民需要的物品。每天销售一万二千份的“江北日报”也照常出版，广播电台将广播器设在街头向全市人民播送胜利的消息。地下电影院里放映着元山人民英雄斗争的新闻纪录片和苏联卫国战争中斯大林格勒保卫战的影片。地下剧院演出着表现守备部队中的共和国英雄许乙龙击沉敌舰两艘的短剧和共和国英雄裴京浩击落敌机十三架的舞蹈。这些反映战斗和生活的影片和戏剧，被人们看成为斗争生活的一部分。元山的人民用坚定的口吻说：“向斯大林格勒的英雄看齐！”
    某纺织工厂的女工们在敌人一度占领元山以前，曾背着沉重的机器零件转移到后方；元山解放以后，她们马上就回来装置和修补好机器，亲自动手在废墟上修建新的工作间。有四个女工在搬运木材时被炮弹炸死了，工人们掩埋好同伴的尸体，马上又继续进行修建工作，终于在半个月内就恢复了生产。老人们为了供应前线战士们蔬菜的需要，在废墟上垦种了一片片绿油油的青菜，有些老人每天还扶着拐杖在瓦砾堆里收集炸弹片献给国家，制造枪炮去打敌人。孩子们在敌人占领元山时，曾帮助游击队割断敌人电线、收集敌人情报，现在，他们也尽一切力量为祖国服务。元山市立第一中学的学生在半年中就收集了两吨半废铁献给国家，还植了二十一万株树。他们并且在两个月中给守备部队组织了十次慰问晚会和写了两百多封慰问信。作家和戏剧家们组成了移动剧团，冒着炮火到前沿阵地为战士们演出。江原道艺术同盟书记长申兴顺去年创作了两个鼓舞人民斗志的剧本，因而获得了共和国三级国旗勋章。
    美国侵略者对元山的破坏是元山人民永远不能忘却的。市立第二中学校长姜利燮的地下办公室的墙壁上，挂着一幅巨大的校舍图：校舍原来是建筑在海滨，绿树掩映着高大美丽的楼房。但是，现在那里已是一片废墟，只有几棵光秃的树干倒在密密的弹坑边。这个五十多岁的老教育家指着校舍图说：
    “让我和孩子们每天都看着它，时刻都记着是谁破坏了我们的学校！”他从事教育事业已经三十多年，在日寇统治时期，因为反对日寇禁止教授朝鲜文坐过监牢。“八一五”朝鲜解放以后，他帮助政府创办了这所学校，忠心耿耿地教育着新的一代。当美国空中强盗把他的学校炸毁以后，他组织学生冒着炮火搬运器材，挖掘山洞，将学校迁入地下，坚持了教学。现在他正在计划保送即将毕业的四十多个学生到保卫祖国的各种战斗岗位上去。元山人民就是用这样坚不可拔的战斗意志，高度的胜利信心，保卫着自己的城市，他们的斗争向全世界人民昭示了一个真理：“人民是不屈的”。
