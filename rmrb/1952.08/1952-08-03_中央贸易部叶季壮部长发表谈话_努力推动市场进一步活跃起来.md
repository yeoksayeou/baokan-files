Minister Ye Jizhuang of the Central Trade Department Speaks
Striving to Further Revitalize the Market

    To understand the recent national market situation, a reporter visited Minister Ye Jizhuang of the Central People's Government Trade Department, who kindly offered the following remarks:

    The national market, after nearly four months of large-scale processing and ordering by the state-owned economy, the issuance of large amounts of industrial and commercial loans by the National Bank, the state-owned trade system launching industrial product promotion campaigns, and the large-scale purchase of new wheat, tea, and silk, especially since the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the urban-rural materials exchange conferences in various regions, has become more active day by day. The sluggish phenomenon that appeared in February and March of this year has basically passed. Private industrialists and merchants in major and medium-sized cities and many small towns have also begun to move, and their confidence and enthusiasm in operating businesses legitimately are gradually increasing.

    The correct and resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's and the Central People's Government's policies on industry and commerce by various state-owned economic departments is the fundamental reason for the market's increasing activity. The amount of funds invested by state-owned trade in market purchases, entrusting processing to industrialists and merchants, and placing orders has increased month by month. Taking February as 100, it had increased to 196.5 by June.

    With the strong support of the state-owned economy, the operating conditions of private industry and commerce have begun to improve. Since April, a series of exchange conferences in various forms held in various places have played a direct role in promoting the exchange of urban and rural materials and revitalizing the market, and have effectively encouraged the enthusiasm of private industrialists and merchants for production and operation. The increase in the enthusiasm of private industrialists and merchants for operation is most clearly reflected in the monthly increase in the funds of private merchants in Shanghai going to the countryside. According to statistics registered by Shanghai private merchants with the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce: the funds of Shanghai private merchants going to the countryside were 114.8 billion yuan in January of this year, but sharply decreased to around 68 billion yuan in February and March. In April, it continued to decrease to 56.6 billion yuan. After the state's strong support and encouragement in various ways to private merchants, it surged to 94.3 billion yuan in May. After the East China Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Conference in June, it further increased to 142.9 billion yuan, exceeding any month in the first half of this year. The recent materials exchange conference in the Central and Southern regions, due to the attraction of many private import and export merchants, has also played a role in promoting the exchange of materials between domestic and foreign markets.

    At present, the turnover of private commerce in major cities across the country has increased significantly. For example, the turnover of hardware, steel, pigments, chemical raw materials and other businesses in Shanghai increased by 70% to 100% in June compared to May. The turnover of 14 wholesale households in the department store industry in Tianjin increased by 25% in June compared to May, exceeding the same period last year by 6.4%. According to key investigations, the business conditions of twelve major industries such as private department stores, electrical materials, local products and food, paper stationery, and tea in Beijing have all tended to improve after the "Five-Anti" campaign. The turnover in June generally increased by 20% to 60% compared to the previous month, and some increased by more than 100%.

    At the same time, the recovery of private industrial production in major cities across the country is also quite rapid. The industries with the largest increase in production and sales are cotton weaving, dyeing and finishing, matches, and papermaking. The output of sixteen industries such as cotton weaving, papermaking, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and acids and alkalis in Tianjin increased by an average of 25% in June compared to May. The recovery and development of industrial production in Shanghai is particularly rapid. From the perspective of industrial turnover, taking the index of January this year as 100, it fell to 65.94 in February, but quickly rebounded to 109.27 in May, and further rose to 125.48 in June, equivalent to 120.74% of the same period last year.

    It can be seen that, on a nationwide scale, market activity and economic prosperity are not only promising, but are gradually becoming a reality before our eyes!

    In order to further revitalize the market and prepare for the upcoming national economic construction, first, the industrial and commercial administration departments and state-owned trade departments of local people's governments are required to better implement the seven policies on private industry and commerce explained by Director Chen Yun at the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, stand firm, and further unite private industrialists and merchants to legally operate businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. At the same time, the policies explained by Director Chen Yun should be widely and deeply communicated to every industrialist and merchant in every town and city across the country, so that those who have not yet understood the policies among them can immediately understand them and give play to their enthusiasm for production and operation; those who already understand them should become even more active. Second, major administrative regions and provinces have mostly held or are holding urban-rural materials exchange conferences and have achieved considerable results. This experience should be promoted, and materials exchange conferences with the main task of carrying out short-distance materials exchange should be held at the prefectural, county, and even district levels. Third, state-owned trade departments should give full play to the patriotic enthusiasm of all employees, quickly do a good job in inventorying warehouses, reviewing commodity prices, and ranking commodities, and should strengthen internal connections between various companies and departments, obtain the cooperation of relevant departments, and widely and deeply carry out industrial product promotion campaigns. Fourth, according to the principles instructed by Director Chen Yun and the recent specific instructions of the Central Trade Department, individual improper methods in import and export management and domestic market management should be quickly and reasonably improved; the idea of local trade companies or cooperatives purchasing all agricultural and sideline products in individual regions should be quickly corrected, so as to plan and lead private merchants to conduct urban-rural exchanges and domestic-foreign exchanges, further revitalize the market and prosper the economy.

    中央贸易部叶季壮部长发表谈话
    努力推动市场进一步活跃起来
    记者为了解最近全国市场情况，特往访中央人民政府贸易部叶季壮部长，承发表谈话如下：
    全国市场，经过近四个月来国营经济的大量加工、订货，国家银行发放大批工商业贷款，国营贸易系统开展工业品推销运动，以及大量收购新麦、茶叶和蚕丝，特别是从中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议和各地区城乡物资交流大会举行以来，已经一天比一天更趋活跃，今年二三月间一度呈现的呆滞现象，基本上已经过去。全国各大中城市和不少小城镇的私营工商业者也已动了起来，他们正当地经营业务的信心和积极性正在逐步提高。
    各个国营经济部门正确地坚决地贯彻了毛主席及中央人民政府的工商业政策，是使市场日趋活跃的根本原因。国营贸易对市场收购、委托工商业者加工、订货的投放金额，逐月增加，以二月份为一百，到六月份已增加到一百九十六点五。
    在国营经济的大力扶植下，私营工商业的经营情况开始好转。四月份以来，各地举行的一系列不同形式的交流会议，对于交流城乡物资、活跃市场更起了直接的推动作用，并且有效地鼓舞了私营工商业者生产和经营的积极性。私营工商业者经营积极性的提高，最明显地反映在上海市私商下乡资金逐月增加的情况上。根据上海私商向市工商局登记的统计：上海私商下乡资金在今年一月是一千一百四十八亿元，二、三月份剧减到各为六百八十亿元左右，四月份续减到五百六十六亿元，经国家对私商大力扶助和多方鼓励后，五月份激增到九百四十三亿元，六月份开过华东区城乡物资交流大会后，更增加到一千四百二十九亿元，超过今年上半年任何一个月。最近中南区的物资交流大会，由于吸引了许多私营进出口商的参加，对于内外物资交流，也起了推动的作用。
    目前，全国各大城市私营商业的营业额都显著增加。例如：上海市五金、钢铁、颜料、化工原料等商业的营业额，六月份比五月份增加七、八成到一倍。天津市百货业中十四个批发户的营业额，六月份比五月份增加百分之二十五，超过去年同期百分之六点四。北京市私营百货、电料、土产食品、纸张文具、茶叶等十二个主要行业的营业情况，根据重点调查，在“五反”后业务都趋向好转，六月份营业额一般比上月增加百分之二十到六十，有的增加一倍多。
    同时，全国各大城市私营工业生产的恢复也相当迅速。产销量增加比重最大的有棉织、染整、火柴、造纸等行业。天津市棉织、造纸、制药、酸碱等十六个行业六月份产量比五月份平均增加百分之二十五。上海市工业生产的恢复和发展尤为迅速，从工业营业额来看，以今年一月份的指数为一百，二月份曾降到六十五点九四，但五月份已迅速回升到一百零九点二七，六月份又上升到一百二十五点四八，相当于去年同期的一百二十点七四。
    由此可见，就全国范围来说，市场活跃，经济繁荣不仅是前途在望，而且已在日渐地变为眼前的现实了！
    为了进一步活跃市场，为即将开始的全国经济建设作好准备，首先要求各地人民政府工商行政管理部门和国营贸易部门更好地执行陈云主任在全国工商联筹备代表会议上所说明的对私营工商业的七项政策，站稳立场，进一步团结私营工商业者合法地经营有利于国计民生的业务。同时，应当把陈云主任说明的政策，广泛、深入地传达给全国每个城镇的每个工商业者，使他们中间某些至今还未了解政策的能够立即了解，发挥生产和经营积极性；已经了解的进一步活跃起来。第二，各大行政区和各省大都已举行过或正在举行城乡物资交流大会，得到不少成绩，应当推广这种经验，立即在各专区、各县、甚至区一级普遍举行以开展短距离物资交流为主要任务的物资交流大会。第三，国营贸易部门应发挥全体职工的爱国热情，迅速做好清查仓库、审查商品价格以及商品排队等工作，并应加强各公司、各部门之间的内部联系，取得各有关部门的配合，广泛地、深入地开展工业品推销运动。第四，应根据陈云主任指示的原则及中央贸易部最近的具体指示，即将有关出入口管理和国内市场管理中个别的不妥善的办法迅速予以合理的改善；对于个别地区地方贸易公司或合作社一律包购农副产品的思想，迅速予以纠正，以便有计划的领导私商进行城乡交流与内外交流，进一步活跃市场与繁荣经济。（新华社）
