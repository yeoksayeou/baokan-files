Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, August 10th—The 18th International Red Cross Conference concluded on the afternoon of the 7th.

The two plenary sessions on the 7th mainly discussed the following issues: re-examining the Chinese proposal condemning the United States for violating the Geneva Conventions, reviewing the Polish proposal on ratifying and complying with the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological weapons, and the Soviet proposal for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons. The results of the conference's work show that the individuals leading the conference and those who support them did not want to uphold the spirit of international cooperation at the conference; they adopted an evasive attitude toward participating in resolving various fundamental issues that are unsettling world public opinion, while the main task of the Red Cross should be to seek solutions to these problems. At the same time, the leaders of the conference and the countries that support them refused to express condemnation, or even their attitude, towards the acts of the American interventionists in Korea who flagrantly violated the Geneva Conventions. They also refused to make effective decisions on such an important issue as the prohibition of atomic weapons.

At the insistence of the Chinese delegation, the Chinese proposal, which was unfairly and hastily rejected by the General Committee last week, was brought up again for consideration by the conference at the plenary session on the morning of the 7th. The conference chairman, Macaulay (Canada), initially ruled to remove the three paragraphs in the proposal describing the US massacre of prisoners of war and civilians, as well as indiscriminate bombing, and rewrite the final two paragraphs as follows: "The 18th International Red Cross Conference condemns any acts that seriously violate the Geneva Conventions and violate the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross;

requests national Red Cross societies to work together to mobilize world public opinion to strive for the immediate cessation of all atrocities violating the Geneva Conventions so that the dignity of these conventions may be maintained."

Obviously, removing the aforementioned three paragraphs meant completely omitting the accusations against US atrocities in Korea. However, even after Macaulay made such a modification, under the interference of the US and other Western countries' delegations, he quickly changed his mind. He even fragmented the Chinese proposal, saying that this proposal, which only condemned in principle any serious violation of the Geneva Conventions, could not find a reason to be passed. Under the guise of "political" and "violation of rules," the Chinese proposal, which truly conformed to the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross, was once again unreasonably rejected. The thief trembled all over when he heard the word "thief" mentioned, which is a clear proof.

As previously reported, the Polish proposal on requiring all countries to ratify and comply with the Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological weapons had already been passed by the General Committee. Although the US and other countries' delegations attempted to kill this proposal at the plenary session, it was still passed.

On the issue of banning atomic weapons, the Soviet delegation submitted a proposal to the conference requesting governments to agree to conclude a convention to immediately, effectively, and unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons, which are weapons of mass destruction of people. The Soviet proposal requested national Red Cross societies to fulfill their responsibilities, requesting them to call on their governments to immediately conclude a convention prohibiting atomic weapons. However, the leaders of the conference used an amendment proposed by the British delegation to completely distort the significance of the Soviet recommendation to prohibit atomic weapons. The British amendment was: "Requests governments to agree on a plan for the international control of atomic energy within the scope of universal disarmament…." Its purpose was to effectively cancel the Soviet proposal to prohibit atomic weapons. The revised Soviet proposal was submitted to the plenary session of the conference after being passed by the General Committee. Soviet representative Slavin said at the plenary session on August 7th that the British amendment to the original proposal was not intended to prohibit atomic weapons effectively as soon as possible, but to delay it. He said that millions of people demand the prohibition of atomic weapons because they are the greatest threat to world peace and security, but the draft resolution now put forward has become a mockery of this demand. He expressed the hope that the conference would pass the Soviet proposal. The justice of the Soviet demands and the close relationship between this demand and the main tasks of the Red Cross were understood by the vast majority of representatives. The Soviet proposal was supported by representatives from Czechoslovakia, Poland, and India. The representative of the Belgian Red Cross proposed his own proposal, which in principle did not contradict the Soviet proposal. However, the leaders of the conference did not want the conference to pass such a proposal. As soon as the Belgian delegation submitted its proposal, the chairman hurriedly announced a recess. He warned that he could not allow continued discussion of these proposals. During the recess, the leaders of the US delegation vigorously campaigned in the conference lounge, trying to prevent the Soviet and Belgian proposals from being passed. After the resumption of the meeting, the Belgian proposal was rejected by a vote of forty-four to twenty-six, with one abstention. The delegations of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, as well as the delegations of Belgium and India, voted in favor of the Belgian amendment. Then the Soviet proposal was rejected by a vote of fifty-five to sixteen. Then, the Soviet proposal distorted by the British amendment was passed by a vote of fifty-two to sixteen (Soviet Union, China, and other countries). Several delegations (India, Indonesia, and other countries) did not participate in the vote.

The conference passed the Norwegian proposal that had been passed by the General Committee earlier, which requested governments to quickly ratify the four 1949 Geneva Conventions.

The conference elected a five-member standing committee of the Red Cross organization, including Bashkov, Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Red Cross Society.

The conference unanimously accepted the invitation from the Indian delegation to hold the next International Red Cross Conference in India in 1956.

### 第十八届国际红十字大会闭幕  美英集团操纵大会再次否决我国谴责美国暴行的提案并无理否决关于禁止原子武器的提案

    第十八届国际红十字大会闭幕
    美英集团操纵大会再次否决我国谴责美国暴行的提案并无理否决关于禁止原子武器的提案
    【新华社多伦多十日电】第十八届国际红十字大会已在七日下午闭幕。
    七日的两次全体会议，主要是讨论下列问题：重新审核谴责美国违背日内瓦公约的中国提案，审查关于批准和遵守一九二五年禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的波兰提案和无条件禁止原子武器的苏联提案。大会工作的结果表明：领导大会的人物以及支持他们的人并不想在大会上维护国际合作的精神；他们对于参加解决各项使世界舆论为之不安的基本问题，采取了规避的态度，而红十字会的主要任务正应该是求得这些问题的解决。同时，大会的领导人物和支持他们的国家，对于美国干涉者在朝鲜横暴地违反日内瓦公约的行为，拒绝表示谴责，甚至拒绝表示他们的态度。对于禁止原子武器这样重要的一个问题，他们也拒绝作出有效的决定。
    在中国代表团的坚决要求下，上星期在总务委员会被不公平而草率地否决了的中国提案，在七日上午的全体会议上又再度提出来让大会审议。大会主席马考莱（加拿大）第一次裁决：取消提案中叙述美国屠杀战俘和平民以及滥肆轰炸的三段，结尾的两段改写如下：“第十八届国际红十字大会谴责任何严重破坏日内瓦公约和违反红十字人道原则的行为；
    要求各国红十字会共同努力，动员世界舆论争取立即终止违反日内瓦公约的一切暴行，使这些公约的尊严得以保持。”
    很明显的，取消上述叙事的三段，就是完全略去了对美国在朝鲜暴行的指责。但是，马考莱即使作了这样的修改，在美国和其他西方国家代表团干涉的影响下，他很快又变了念头。他甚至于割裂了中国提案，说这个只是在原则上谴责任何严重破坏日内瓦公约行为的提案不能找到可以通过的理由。在“政治的”和“违背规则”的借口下，真正符合于红十字人道原则的中国提案又一次被无理否决。贼在听到提及“贼”字时，就全身发抖，这是一个明显的证明。
    前已报道，波兰提出的关于要求各国批准和遵守禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的提案在总务委员会已经通过。尽管美国和其他国家的代表团企图在全体会议上扼杀这个提案，可是，这个提案还是通过了。
    在禁止原子武器问题上，苏联代表团向大会提出了一个提案，要求各国政府同意缔结一项公约：立即有效地、无条件地禁止原子武器这种大规模屠杀人民的武器。苏联提案要求各国红十字会履行它们的职责，要求它们呼吁它们的政府立即缔结一个禁止原子武器的公约。然而大会的领导人物却借着英国代表团提出的修正案来完全歪曲苏联要求禁止原子武器的建议的意义。英国的修正案是：“要求各国政府在普遍裁军的范围内协议一个国际管制原子能的计划……。”它的目的是在实际上取消苏联的禁止原子武器的提案。被修改了的苏联提案经总务委员会通过后，提交到大会全体会议。苏联代表司拉文在八月七日全体会议上发言说：英国对原提案提出的修改，其目的不在于尽早有效地禁止原子武器，而是在于推迟它。他说：千百万人民要求禁止原子武器，因为它是对世界和平与安全的最大威胁，然而现在提出来的决议草案，却成了对这种要求的嘲弄。他表示希望大会能通过苏联的提案。苏联要求的正义性以及这种要求与红十字的主要任务的密切关联的关系，是绝大多数代表都明白的。苏联建议得到捷克斯洛伐克、波兰与印度代表的支持。比利时红十字会代表提出他自己的与苏联提案在原则上并不矛盾的提案。然而大会的领导人物并不想大会通过这种提案。比利时代表团一提出它的提案之后，主席赶紧就宣布休会。他警告说，他不能容许对这些提案继续讨论下去。在休会的时候，美国代表团的领袖们在会议休息室中大肆活动，竭力阻止苏联和比利时的提案获得通过。复会后表决的结果，比利时提案以四十四票对二十六票被否决，一票弃权。投票赞成比利时修正案的有苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的代表团以及比利时和印度的代表团。接着苏联提案以五十五票对十六票被否决。然后，被英国修正案所歪曲了的苏联提案以五十二票对十六票（苏联、中国及其他国家）被通过。若干代表团（印度、印尼及其他国家）都没有参加投票。
    大会通过了总务委员会早些时所通过的挪威提案，这个提案要求各国政府迅速批准一九四九年的四个日内瓦公约。
    大会选举了红十字机构的五人常设委员会，其中有苏联红十字会副主席巴什科夫。
    大会一致接受了印度代表团提出的下届国际红十字大会于一九五六年在印度举行的邀请。
