Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, August 8th: The International Red Cross Conference continued its plenary session on the 6th, discussing the joint proposal by Britain and Belgium, passed by the General Affairs Committee, regarding a so-called investigation into the U.S.'s violation of the Geneva Conventions.

    Su Jingguan, chief representative of the People's Republic of China delegation, issued a statement. He once again condemned the U.S. military's various atrocities in Korea in violation of the Geneva Conventions and its heinous crimes of conducting germ warfare against the Korean and Chinese people. He pointed out that these atrocities of the United States are evidenced by various proofs brought by the Chinese delegation. However, in the General Affairs Committee of the conference, the Chinese delegation's proposal on "Measures to Safeguard the Dignity of the Geneva Conventions" was rejected almost without discussion. Su Jingguan expressed protest against this and once again requested the conference to reconsider the Chinese delegation's proposal to condemn the atrocities of the U.S. military in Korea in violation of the Geneva Conventions and conducting germ warfare.

    S. A. Slaven, chief representative of the delegation of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union, then spoke. He pointed out that the purpose of the Anglo-Belgian proposal is to cast doubt on the atrocities and germ warfare atrocities of the U.S. military, as if these matters have not yet been confirmed. However, former U.S. prisoner-of-war camp commanders Colson and Dodd have already admitted to the atrocities in the Geoje Island and Busan prisoner-of-war camps. Letters from prisoners of war and many dispatches from British and American journalists have also confirmed the above situation. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team confirmed the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States. The true facts, the bacteriological bombs dropped by U.S. planes and insects carrying bacteria, and the confessions of U.S. pilots who dropped these bacteriological bombs are all there. There are also the victims among the peaceful residents of northern Korea and China. In the United States, there are also specially established institutions for cultivating various bacteria. The Chinese and Korean representatives brought evidence to prove all this, and the fact that bacteria were used has been definitively confirmed by authoritative international investigation teams. Therefore, no new evidence and new investigations are needed. Slaven said that the purpose of the Anglo-Belgian proposal is to deceive world opinion and sow the seeds of doubt, so as to exonerate the U.S. military from its crimes of using bacteriological weapons, mass slaughtering unarmed peaceful residents, and committing atrocities against prisoners of war. Based on the above circumstances, the Soviet delegation will vote against the Anglo-Belgian proposal.

    In their speeches, which totaled only twenty minutes, the Chinese and Soviet representatives were interrupted by Chairman Macaulay twenty times on the absurd grounds that the content of their speeches "involved politics." Only because the Chinese and Soviet representatives repeatedly protested the chairman's unfair attitude were they able to finish speaking.

    Before the vote on the Anglo-Belgian proposal, Li Dequan, chief representative of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, delivered a speech. She protested the chairman's discriminatory and unjust attitude toward the Chinese proposal and stated the Chinese delegation's attitude towards the issue of investigation. She said: "The Chinese people have never refused and will never refuse any fair, sincere, and independent international persons and organizations to investigate the atrocities and germ warfare of the American troops. But the Chinese delegation has clear reasons to be convinced that the Chinese people will certainly refuse any investigation by individuals or organizations like the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross, because it is merely a tool of a certain Western country. To ensure the fairness and effectiveness of the investigation, it is necessary to obtain the consent of the two victimized countries—the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This investigation must be conducted by persons who are also considered fair, independent, and sincere by the governments of the two countries, and representatives from the governments of both countries must participate in all investigation activities."

    She said: "Since the conference completely disregards the Chinese delegation's speeches and repeated requests, and does not say a word of condemnation or even disapproval of the various inhumane acts of the U.S. military in Korea, and now decides to vote on the Anglo-Belgian proposal, the Chinese delegation must formally inform the conference: Because the Anglo-Belgian proposal is worded vaguely and can be interpreted in various ways, and it does not include some of the conditions necessary to ensure a truly fair, sincere, and independent investigation as pointed out in my speech, the Chinese delegation therefore believes that there is no reason to be bound by this proposal. We request the conference to record this important statement of our delegation in the conference minutes."

    Next, the voting machine started, and the conference passed the Anglo-Belgian proposal with sixty-nine votes to twelve. The Soviet Union and the delegations of the People's Democratic countries voted against it, and the Chinese delegation abstained.

Su Jingguan's Statement at the Plenary Session of the International Red Cross Conference on the 6th

    The Chinese delegation has been granted permission by the chairman to make a statement on this issue—the issue of ratifying, popularizing, and implementing the Geneva Conventions. As you all know, the 1949 Geneva Conventions are a definite advancement in international law in terms of wartime humanity. I believe that everyone present will agree with me that faithfully implementing and strictly enforcing these conventions is beneficial to mankind because doing so protects the victims of war.

    Undoubtedly, the Geneva Conventions were signed not for them to be violated later. Whenever there is a violation of the conventions, it means that these conventions have not been faithfully implemented or strictly enforced. These facts of violation of the conventions, if brought up to the conference, are entirely for the purpose of implementing the conventions, and therefore must never be regarded as "matters outside the topic" and forbidden to be spoken about; nor can this be lightly dismissed as "political propaganda."

    Ladies and gentlemen! At this very moment, serious violations of the Geneva Conventions are constantly occurring in Korea. We are delegations of signatory countries to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. We have an obligation to ensure that this convention is respected, so we believe it is our right to bring these matters to the attention of the conference. If the people attending this conference are truly concerned about humanitarianism and the implementation of the aforementioned conventions, then everyone should have a sense of responsibility to humanity, abandon prejudices, and seriously study these facts. It is for this reason that we insist on presenting our proposal on "Measures to Safeguard the Dignity of the Geneva Conventions" to the plenary session again and requesting its adoption.

    As you all know, this proposal was submitted to the General Affairs Committee on July 28th. When the General Affairs Committee first discussed this proposal on July 30th, in my speech, I listed many irrefutable facts proving that the U.S. armed forces in Korea have been and continue to commit a series of atrocities in violation of many provisions of the three Geneva Conventions regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, regarding the improvement of the situation of the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field, and regarding the protection of civilians in wartime. These facts also prove that the seriousness of these events has reached the extent of serious violations of the provisions of these conventions. I also accused that germ warfare, which even Hitler dared not try in World War II, was and still is being carried out in northern Korea and even in Northeast China. I have repeatedly announced that the Chinese delegation has brought various complete pieces of evidence, including films, recordings, photographs, and other documents, books, etc., and requested the conference authorities to assist in submitting these materials to the conference for fair study. Obviously, without such assistance from the conference authorities, the Chinese delegation, only as guests of the Canadian Red Cross, would not be able to do so. I regret to say that the conference authorities directly refused to provide such assistance. There was no film projector, no room for displaying pictures, and especially our proposal was rejected in the General Affairs Committee almost without discussion, and the report of the General Affairs Committee did not even mention such a thing. This is very unfair, and I request that my protest be officially recorded in the conference minutes.

    Ladies and gentlemen! The serious acts of undermining the Geneva Conventions committed in Korea, and the germ warfare being carried out there, have not only been proven by the evidence we have brought, but also repeatedly reported and confirmed by Western newspapers and many eyewitnesses.

    It is useless to close your eyes to the clear truth and merely talk about "ratifying, popularizing, and implementing the Geneva Conventions." If the serious accusations in the Chinese delegation's proposal are lightly dismissed under the pretext of "purely political propaganda," then the prestige of this international conference will be fatally damaged, and the future of the International Red Cross will be greatly threatened. Therefore, the Chinese delegation once again strongly requests the conference to reconsider the aforementioned proposal requesting condemnation of the atrocities and germ warfare of the U.S. armed forces in Korea.

    中苏代表在国际红十字大会上
    谴责美军违反日内瓦公约和细菌战的罪行
    我国代表团声明不受所谓英比联合提案的约束
    【新华社多伦多八日电】国际红十字大会在六日继续举行全体会议，讨论大会总务委员会通过的英国和比利时建议所谓对美国违反日内瓦公约事进行调查的联合提案。
    中华人民共和国代表团首席代表苏井观发表声明。他再一次谴责美军在朝鲜违反日内瓦公约的种种暴行和对朝中人民进行细菌战的滔天罪行。他指出：美国的这些暴行有中国代表团带来的各种证据为证。但是，在大会总务委员会上，中国代表团提出的关于“维护日内瓦公约尊严的措施”的提案，几乎没有经过讨论就被否决了。苏井观对此表示抗议，并再一次要求大会重新考虑中国代表团提出的谴责在朝美军违反日内瓦公约的暴行和进行细菌战的提案。
    苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会代表团首席代表司拉文接着发言。他指出：英比提案的目的在于对美军暴行和细菌战暴行投以疑云，好像这些事还没有得到证实的样子。但是，美国前战俘营长官柯尔生和杜德已经承认了巨济岛和釜山战俘营的暴行。战俘的信件、英美记者的许多电讯也证实了上述情况。国际民主法律工作者协会调查团证实了美国使用细菌武器。真实的事实、美机投掷的细菌弹和带有细菌的昆虫、投掷这些细菌弹的美国飞行员的供词，件件俱在。朝鲜北部和中国的和平居民中的受难人也在。在美国，还有特别设立的培养各种细菌的机构。中国和朝鲜代表带来了证明这一切的证据，使用细菌的事实已有权威性的国际调查团肯定证实。因此，不再需要任何新的证据和新的调查。司拉文说：英比提案的目的在于蒙蔽世界舆论，播下怀疑的种子，这样来为美军开脱他们使用细菌武器、大规模屠杀没有武装的和平居民和对战俘的暴行等罪行。基于上述情况，苏联代表团将投票反对英比提案。
    中国和苏联代表在总共不过二十分钟的发言中，被主席马考莱以所谓发言内容“涉及政治”的荒谬理由，一连打断了二十次。只是由于中苏代表一再对主席这种不公平的态度提出抗议，他们才能说完话。
    在对英比提案进行表决之前，中国红十字会代表团首席代表李德全发表演说。她抗议主席对于中国提案所采取的歧视的和不公正的态度，并表明中国代表团对于调查问题的态度。她说：“中国人民从来没有拒绝并且将来也不会拒绝任何公正、真诚和独立的国际人士与团体来调查美国军队的暴行和细菌战。但是中国代表团有明显的理由可以确信：中国人民一定会拒绝任何像所谓红十字国际委员会这样的个人或团体来进行调查，因为它只不过是某个西方国家的工具而已。要保证调查的公正和有效，就必需取得两个受害国家——中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的同意。这种调查必须由两国政府也认为公正、独立和真诚的人士来进行，并且必须由两国政府各派代表参加全部调查活动。”
    她说：“既然大会完全不顾中国代表团的发言和一再提出的要求，对于美军在朝鲜的各种不人道行为不说一句谴责的话、甚至连不赞成的表示也没有，而现在又决定对英比提案进行表决，中国代表团不得不正告大会：因为英比提案措词颇为含糊，它可以作各种不同的解释，并且它又没有把我的发言中所指出的为了保证真正公正、真诚和独立的调查所必要的一些条件包含在内，中国代表团因此认为没有理由使自己受这种提案的约束。我们要求大会把我国代表团这个重要的声明记入在大会记录。”
    接着，表决机器开动了，大会以六十九票对十二票通过了英比提案，苏联及各人民民主国家代表团投票反对，中国代表团弃权。苏井观在国际红十字大会六日全体会议上的声明
    中国代表团得到主席的允许，对这个问题——批准、普及和实施日内瓦公约的问题发表声明。诸位都知道，一九四九年的各日内瓦公约是国际法在战争人道方面的一个确实的进步。我相信，在座诸君都会同意我的意见，忠实地实施并严格地执行这些公约，是有利于人类的，因为这样做保护了战争受害者。
    毫无疑问，日内瓦公约之所以签订，并不是为的让它后来被破坏。无论什么时候有违反公约的情事发生，那意思就是说，这些公约并没有得到忠实实施或严格执行。这些违反公约的事实，如果提到大会上来，那完全是为了实施公约，因此绝不能被目为“正题以外的事”而禁止发言；更不能把这说成
    “政治宣传”而轻轻地搁开。
    诸位女士！诸位先生！就在目前，严重违反日内瓦公约的情事正在朝鲜不断地发生着。我们是一九四九年的日内瓦公约签约国的代表团。我们有义务保证这个公约受到尊重，因此我们认为把这些事情提请大会注意是我们的权利。假如出席这次大会的人们果真关切人道主义，果真关切上述公约的实施，那么每一个人都应该抱着对人类的责任感，捐弃成见，认真研究一下这些事实。就是为了这个缘故，我们才坚持主张再把我们关于“维护日内瓦公约的尊严的措施”提案向全体大会提出，请求通过。
    诸位都知道，这个提案是在七月二十八日向总务委员会提出的。当七月三十日总务委员会第一次讨论这提案的时候，我在发言中列举了许多无可辩驳的事实，证明美国在朝鲜的武装部队过去和现在一直不断地在犯一连串的暴行，违反了关于战俘待遇、关于改善战地武装部队伤者病者境遇以及关于战时保护平民的三个日内瓦公约的许多条款。这些事实还证明，这些事件的严重性已达到了严重地违反了这些公约的规定的程度。我还指责过，甚至希特勒在第二次世界大战中都不敢一试的细菌战，过去和现在仍在朝鲜北部、甚至在中国的东北进行。我曾经一再宣布中国代表团带来各种完完全全的证据，有电影、录音、照片和其他文件、书籍等，并要求大会当局协助，把这些材料提交大会作公正的研究。显然，如果没有大会当局这种协助，中国代表团仅以加拿大红十字会宾客的身份，是不能这样作的。我遗憾地说，大会当局直截地拒绝给予这种协助。没有电影放映机，没有展览图片的房间，而尤其是我们的提案几乎没有经过讨论，就在总务委员会中被否决了，总务委员会的报告甚至没有提到这么一回事。这是非常不公平的，我要求把我的抗议正式列入大会记录。
    诸位女士！诸位先生！在朝鲜所犯的严重破坏日内瓦公约的行为，和在该地进行的细菌战，不仅已由我们带来的证据证明，而且西方报纸和许多目击者亦曾多次报道和加以证实。
    在明白的真理面前闭上眼睛，一味空谈“批准、普及和实施日内瓦公约”是没有用的。假如以“纯系政治宣传”为藉口，轻轻推开中国代表团提案中的严重指责，那么这个国际会议的威望就会受到致命伤害，国际红十字的前途也会大大地受到威胁。因此，中国代表团再一次强烈地要求大会重新考虑上述要求谴责在朝美国武装部队的暴行和细菌战的提案。
