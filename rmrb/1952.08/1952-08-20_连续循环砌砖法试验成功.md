    Successful Experiment with Continuous Circular Bricklaying Method

    To the Editor: When promoting the Su Changyou continuous bricklaying method at the construction site of a technical school affiliated with the state-owned Taiyuan Engineering Company, technicians Zhai Fengsong and Zhao Xiaofeng went deep into the site, studied the technology, and discovered that the continuous segmented bricklaying method still had some inconveniences, because workers had to adjust the string line every time they finished a section of bricklaying; if two teams used the continuous circular bricklaying method, they could save the time of adjusting the string line and improve labor efficiency. The results of their trial use of the circular bricklaying method showed that in the past, one skilled worker and two assistants at the construction site could only lay 800 bricks per person per day in nine hours; now, two bricklaying teams (two skilled workers and six assistants) can lay a total of 11,086 bricks in nine hours a day, increasing production efficiency by four and a half times compared to before the promotion of advanced working methods. The quality has also been greatly improved. The Party committee of the construction site attaches great importance to this advanced working method and is now vigorously promoting it.

    连续循环砌砖法试验成功
    编辑同志：公营太原工程公司某技术学校现场工地，在推广苏长有连续砌砖法时，技术人员翟凤松和赵晓峰深入现场，钻研技术，发现连续分段砌砖法还有些不便之处，因为工人每砌完一段砖后，需再调回头提线；如果使用两个小组，运用连续循环砌砖法，就可以省去调回头提线的时间，并提高劳动效率。他们试用循环砌砖法的结果，过去该工地一个大工，二个小工，平均每人每天九小时只能砌砖八百块；现在，两个砌砖小组（两个大工，六个小工），每天九小时共砌砖一万一千零八十六块，比推广先进工作法以前提高生产效率四倍半。质量也大大地提高。该工地党委对这项先进工作法很重视，现在正大力推广。    王士俊
