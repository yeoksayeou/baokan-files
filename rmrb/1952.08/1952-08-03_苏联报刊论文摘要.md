	Continuously Improve the Work of Selecting and Allocating Cadres

	The editorial in the twelfth issue of "Bolshevik Magazine" points out several problems in improving the work of selecting and allocating cadres, summarized as follows:

	What does it mean to correctly select cadres and correctly assign them work? Comrade Stalin instructed: "In selecting personnel, first, we must base it on political indicators, that is, whether they are worthy of political trust; second, we must base it on competence indicators, that is, whether they are suitable for a specific job." When selecting cadres, both indicators should be used as a basis; one cannot become bogged down in transactional views of professional competence, only caring about the professional level of staff; nor can one make political views all-encompassing and the only thing that matters, only paying attention to the political outlook of staff without caring about their professional level.

	Some leaders in Party and Soviet organs complain that they lack "suitable staff." They are accustomed to relying on a small group of cadres, not paying attention to those who are loyal to the Party, familiar with their work, and capable people who have matured. They are afraid to boldly promote young cadres, or they are simply impatient to "take care" of them, unwilling to trouble themselves. Such leaders do not deeply study the cadres who are growing, do not regularly cultivate and educate them, but prefer to associate with that same small group of staff, busily transferring them from one position to another, even when they have made major mistakes.

	Naturally, this complaint of "not enough staff" cannot stand up to any criticism. There are many capable and talented people, one only needs to understand them and promote them in a timely manner.

	Women cadres are a rich reserve force from which the Party can draw new strength. In all sectors of our national economy, women cadres are working successfully. The number of women experts with higher education has more than doubled compared to 1940 before the war, now exceeding 830,000. But at the same time, it is proven that the factor of conservative thinking has not been completely eradicated in the work of selecting women cadres. Leaders of some local organs do not have enough understanding of women cadres. They have not noticed that in recent years the training of women cadres in all national economic and cultural sectors has been greatly improved, and have not noticed that the base and reserve force for promoting women cadres has expanded unprecedentedly. Party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations should better utilize the growing opportunities in promoting women cadres, and more bravely promote advanced women to leadership positions in all national economic and cultural sectors. Promoting women to leadership positions is a vitally important national task.

	The ability to recognize people is a valuable quality of Bolshevik organizers. Understanding cadres makes it possible for Party committees to recognize those who should be promoted to leadership positions, ensuring that no mistakes occur in the selection of staff. It is necessary to carefully study the political and professional levels of staff in order to allocate cadres in such a way that everyone feels they are in the right place and can better发挥their talents. Studying cadres is a major and meticulous task. Judgments of people should not be based solely on resume materials, casual remarks, or initial impressions, lacking knowledge of the person themselves, and failing to conduct practical reviews of them in their actual work. Their strengths and weaknesses can be recognized in the work of cadres, in their implementation of Party and government resolutions. Therefore, leaders must maintain more contact with Party members, activists, and the broad masses of workers, and consider their opinions on staff.

	Everyone knows that cadres are not ready-made and dropped from the sky. The qualities they should possess are acquired in the course of work and cultivated by the Party organization through its Bolshevik education system. Now, when the Soviet people are striving to carry out the glorious task of building communism, it is especially important to improve the education of cadres day by day, because raising the level of leadership in any part of our construction first requires relying on the Marxist-Leninist cultivation and proficiency of Party, Soviet, economic, and other staff.

	Honesty and Principle in Economic Work

	The Truth Daily published an editorial on July 1st, pointing out that economic workers must lead economic work with a spirit of complete responsibility for the interests of the state. A summary follows:

	Under socialism, being a leader in economic work means gaining the trust of all the people, gaining great glory and honor. The vast majority of Soviet economic workers are deeply aware of their responsibility to the people and the country, and have therefore been striving to complete their tasks—not formally but creatively and energetically.

	However, we can still encounter economic leaders who have deviated from the correct path and lowered themselves to the level of political philistines. These people do not treat the state with an honest attitude, or they place the interests of their departments and localities above the interests of the state.

	This incorrect attitude of certain economic workers towards the interests of the state is manifested in reporting the implementation of production plans not according to the products produced. In addition, individual economic workers attempt to reduce the production volume of their enterprises when reporting, in order to obtain smaller production plans, so that they do not have to be too strained when implementing the plans.

	In the work of leading production, various irresponsible attitudes and lax phenomena, non-master attitudes towards equipment and its use, waste of materials, and slackness of work are all completely contrary to the interests of the state. In many enterprises, the fact that substandard products or low-quality output harms the interests of the state cannot be ignored either.

	These facts indicate the need to strengthen supervision of compliance with state laws, and the need to strengthen the systematic inspection of the implementation of orders from higher authorities.

	The mission of Party organizations is to arm our economic cadres with Marxist-Leninist theory, to strictly demand of themselves and their staff in a spirit of honesty and principle, and to educate economic cadres with a spirit of uncompromising criticism of shortcomings.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    不断地改进选拔和分配干部的工作
    “布尔什维克杂志”第十二期的社论指出改进选拔和
    分配干部的工作方面的几个问题，摘要如下：
    正确地选拔干部和正确地给干部分配工作是指什么呢？斯大林同志指示说：“挑选工作人员，第一，要依据政治的标志，就是说，他们是否值得政治上的信任；第二，要依据办事的标志，就是说，他们是否适合于做某一具体工作。”在选择干部时，应当同时以这两个标志为根据；不能把对业务的看法变得事务主义的，仅仅关心工作人员的业务水平；也不能把对政治的看法变得无所不包的唯一的东西，仅仅注意工作人员的政治面貌，而不关心他们的业务水平。
    党和苏维埃机关的有些领导者们抱怨他们缺乏
    “适宜的工作人员”，他们习惯于依靠一小群干部，而不注意那些忠于党，并熟悉于自己工作的、已经成熟的、有能力的人们。他们不敢放手提拔年轻干部，或者只是不耐烦“照顾”他们，不愿自找麻烦。这样的领导者没有深刻地研究正在成长的干部，没有经常对他们进行培养和教育，却宁愿和老是那么一小群工作人员发生关系，于是，忙着把他们从这岗位调到那个岗位，甚至在他们犯了重大错误的时候也还是这样做。
    自然，这种“工作人员不够”的抱怨是经受不起任何批评的。有能力有天才的人很多，只需要了解他们并及时提拔他们。    
    妇女干部是丰富的后备力的所在，党可以从那里汲取新的力量。在我国国民经济的各部门，妇女干部都成功地工作着。受过高等教育的妇女专家人数，已比战前的一九四○年增加了两倍以上，现在已超过八十三万人。但与此同时，事实证明在选拔妇女干部的工作上，保守心理的因素还没有完全根绝。一些地方机关的领导者们对妇女干部了解不够，他们没有注意到近年来在所有的国民经济和文化部门中对妇女干部的培养已经大大地改善，没有注意到提拔妇女干部的基础和后备军已空前扩大了。党、苏维埃、职工会和共青团组织应当更好地利用在提拔妇女干部方面的增长着的机会，更勇敢地把先进的妇女提升到所有国民经济和文化部门的领导工作上去。把妇女提拔到领导岗位上去是一个极关重要的国家任务。
    对人的识别是布尔什维克组织者的宝贵品质。对干部的了解使党委会有可能认出那些人应当被提升到领导工作上去，保证在选拔工作人员时不发生错误。必须把工作人员的政治和业务水平，细心研究一番，才有可能在分配干部时，使每人都能感到各得其所，并更好地发挥他的才能。研究干部是一件重大的、细致的工作。对人的判断不要仅仅依据履历表的材料、偶然的议论、初次的印象，而缺乏对他本身的认识，在活生生的工作中，又对他不作切实的审查。在干部的工作中，在他对党和政府的决议的执行中，可以认识到他的优点和缺点。因此，领导者必须和共产党员、积极分子、广大的劳动群众更多地保持接触，并考虑他们对工作人员的意见。
    大家知道，干部并不是现成地由天上掉下来的。他们所应具有的品质是在工作过程中获得的，是党组织用它的布尔什维克教育制度所陶冶出来的。现在当苏联人民正在努力从事实现共产主义建设的辉煌任务的时候，逐日地改善对干部的教育就更显得特别重要，因为要在我们任何部分的建设方面提高领导水平，首先都非依靠党、苏维埃、经济部门和其他的工作人员的马列主义修养和他们的熟练程度不可。
    经济工作中的诚实和原则性
    真理报七月一日发表社论，指出经济工作者必须以对国家利益完全负责的精神来领导经济工作。摘要如下：
    在社会主义条件下做一个经济工作的领导者，这就意味着得到全体人民的信任，得到伟大的光荣和荣誉。苏联绝大多数经济工作者都深切地意识到自己对人民和国家的责任，因而一直努力于完成自己的任务——不是形式地而是创造性地、奋发地完成它。
    然而，现在我们也还可以遇到这样的经济领导者，他们离开了正确道路，降低到政治庸人的水平。这些人不以诚实的态度对待国家，或者是把本部门和地方利益置于国家利益之上。
    某些经济工作者对待国家利益的这种不正确态度，表现在不是按生产出来的产品，报告执行生产计划的情况。此外，个别经济工作者在报告时企图缩小本企业的生产量，以便得到比较不大的生产计划，这样在执行计划时可以不必过于紧张。
    在领导生产工作中，各种不负责任的态度和松弛的现象，对设备及其使用的非主人翁的态度，浪费物资和工作的懈怠，都是完全违背国家利益的。在许多企业中，出产不合标准的产品或质量低的产量，使国家利益受到损害的事实，也是不可忽视的。
    这些事实说明必须加强对遵守国家法律的监督，必须加强对执行上级机关的命令情况的系统检查。
    党组织的使命是要以马克思列宁主义理论武装我们的经济干部，要以诚实和原则性的精神严格地要求自己和所属工作人员并以对缺点不妥协的精神来教育经济干部。
