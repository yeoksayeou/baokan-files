Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th: The American air force carried out another brutal bombing of residential areas in Pyongyang at noon on the 4th. Many elderly people, women and children were killed. Civilians who did not have time to escape to air-raid shelters were strafed by American fighter planes on the streets.

The people of Pyongyang protest the atrocities of the American invaders. Korean newspapers point out that the U.S. Air Force's barbaric bombing of Pyongyang and other cities in northern Korea is directly related to the Americans' behavior in the Korean armistice negotiations at Panmunjom. Korean newspapers say that this bombing is part of the so-called "military pressure" exerted on the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegations, and the U.S. side vainly attempts to rely on this pressure to achieve its unreasonable demands. However, such barbaric acts by the American invaders can never subdue the heroic Korean people, but will only arouse stronger anger from the Korean people and the people of the world.

    美机又滥炸平壤居民区
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社平壤讯：美国空军在四日中午对平壤的居民区又施行残暴的轰炸。不少老年人、妇女和儿童被炸死。没有来得及逃往避弹壕的平民，在大街上遭到美国战斗机扫射。
    平壤的人民抗议美国侵略者的暴行。朝鲜报纸指出：美国空军对平壤和朝鲜北部其他城市的野蛮轰炸，与美国人在板门店朝鲜停战谈判中的行为有直接的关系。朝鲜报纸说：这种轰炸是对朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军代表团实施所谓“军事压力”的一部分，美方妄想依靠这种压力来达到它的无理要求。但是，美国侵略者的这种野蛮行为决不可能使英勇的朝鲜人民屈服，而只能引起朝鲜人民和全世界人民更强烈的愤怒。
