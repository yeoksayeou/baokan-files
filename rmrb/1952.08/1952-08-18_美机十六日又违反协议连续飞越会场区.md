Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th. U.S. military aircraft once again violated the agreement, continuously flying over the Panmunjom conference area from 7:45 PM to 7:55 PM on August 16th. This violation of the agreement has been confirmed by a joint investigation by security officers from both sides. Our Chief Liaison Officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, protested to the U.S. Chief Liaison Officer regarding this matter on the 17th. Since the U.S. Chief Delegate Harrison adopted the tactic of continuous long-term adjournments to sabotage the Korean armistice talks, this is the fifth time that U.S. military aircraft have violated the agreement by flying over the conference area. The other four times were on August 4th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. Although the evidence is conclusive, the U.S. side, apart from reluctantly admitting responsibility for the incidents on the 10th and 11th, still flatly denies the incident on the 4th, and has not yet dealt with the incident on the 12th. When admitting the incidents on the 10th and 11th, the U.S. side, as usual, expressed "regret" and promised to "continue efforts to avoid the recurrence of such incidents." But before the words were even finished, incidents of U.S. aircraft violating the agreement occurred continuously. Sources here pointed out: This kind of faithless behavior on the part of the U.S. side is obviously one of the despicable means to sabotage the armistice negotiations.

    美机十六日又违反协议连续飞越会场区
    【新华社开城十七日电】美方军用飞机又一次违反协议，在八月十六日下午七时四十五分至七时五十五分，连续飞越板门店会场区。这一违反协议事件经双方安全军官共同调查证实。我方首席联络官张春山上校十七日就此事对美方首席联络官提出抗议。自美方首席代表哈利逊采取连续长期休会的破坏朝鲜停战谈判策略以来，这是美方军用飞机第五次违反协议飞越会场区。另外四次是在八月四日、十日、十一日和十二日。虽然证据确凿，但美方除勉强承认十日和十一日两次事件的责任外，对四日的事件仍矢口抵赖，而对十二日的事件则至今未作处理。美方在承认十日、十一日两次事件时，照例表示“遗憾”，并且承诺“将继续努力避免这类事件的重复发生”。但是话犹未已，美机违反协议的事件又连续发生。此间人士指出：美方这种毫无信义的行为，显然是破坏停战谈判的卑劣手段之一。
