    The Happy Life of the Korean People in Mingyan Village, Northeast China
    To the Editor: I am reporting to you on the situation of the people in a Korean village in Northeast China after their liberation.
    By the Tumen River in Northeast China (Helong County, Jilin Province) is Mingyan Village, entirely populated by 204 Korean households. Before liberation, the peasants lived a life of misery under the oppression of the reactionaries. After the land reform, each person had three mu of land, and more than 90 percent of the labor force participated in mutual aid teams. The number of draught cattle in the village increased from 60 to more than 180, the number of carts increased from 50 to more than 90, and the number of farm tools increased from more than 90 to more than 250, including new-style farm tools such as paddy field plows and combined shovels and harrows. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the whole village launched a patriotic production increase movement. Last year, the whole village harvested more than 676,000 kilograms of grain from 375 hectares of paddy and dry land, with an average yield of more than 4,135 kilograms per hectare for paddy fields and an average yield of 1,350 kilograms per hectare for dry land, creating an unprecedented record. Peasants who used to pick up bad potatoes from the landlords' fields are now storing grain in overflowing granaries; peasants who used to live with their livestock are now living in new houses; peasants who used to be unable to afford even hemp clothing now have clothes for work, clothes for everyday wear, and clothes for going out. The whole village has also bought nine sewing machines. In the past, the whole village only had seven wells, but now there are more than 100 new-style wells, with an average of one well for every two households, making life more convenient for the peasants. In the past, more than 40 percent of school-age children in the village could not afford to go to school, and only one person attended middle school. Now, a primary school has been established in the village, and all school-age children in the village are attending school. At the same time, a kindergarten has also been established, and more than 40 middle school students are studying in other places. In addition, the whole village has six year-round night schools with more than 220 students. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated in the village. The village subscribes to more than 90 copies of the Northeast Daily, Jilin Daily, and Northeast Korean People's Daily, with an average of one newspaper for every two households. There is also a club in the village.
    The Korean people of Mingyan Village, living a happy life, unanimously praise Chairman Mao: "Your leadership has given us today's happiness. You are our sun, and we will always follow you!"

    东北明岩村朝鲜族人民的幸福生活
    编辑同志：我向你们报告东北一个朝鲜族村人民翻身后的情况。
    东北图们江边（吉林省和龙县）有一个明岩村，全村二百零四户完全是朝鲜族人民。解放前，农民们在反动派压榨下过着痛苦不堪的日子。土地改革后每人有了三亩地，百分之九十以上的劳动力都参加了互助组。全村的耕牛由六十头增加到一百八十多头，大车由五十辆增加到九十多辆，农具由九十多付增加到二百五十多付，内有水田洋犁、综合铲趟机等新式农具。在共产党、人民政府领导下，全村开展了爱国丰产运动。去年全村三百七十五垧水、旱地，打了六十七万六千多公斤的粮食，水田每垧平均产量八千二百七十多斤，旱田每垧平均产量二千七百斤，创造了空前的纪录。过去常年在地主的地头上拾坏土豆吃的农民，现在是粮食堆满仓了；过去是人和牲口住在一起的农民，现在都盖了新房子；过去是麻布衣也穿不上的农民，现在干活有干活的衣服，家常有家常的衣服，出门有出门的衣服了。全村还买了九架缝衣机。过去全村只有七口水井，现在有一百多口新式水井，平均两户就有一口，农民们感到方便了。过去全村有百分之四十以上的学龄儿童上不起学，上中学的只有一人，现在村里建立了一所小学，全村学龄儿童都上学了，同时还建立了一所幼儿园，并有四十多名中学生在外地求学。另外，全村有了常年夜校六处，学员二百二十多名。全村基本上消灭了文盲。村中订有九十多份东北日报、吉林日报和东北朝鲜人民报，平均两户有一份报纸。村中还有一个俱乐部。
    过着幸福生活的明岩村朝鲜族人民一致歌颂毛主席：“您的领导使我们有了今天的幸福。您是我们的太阳，我们永远跟着您走！”
