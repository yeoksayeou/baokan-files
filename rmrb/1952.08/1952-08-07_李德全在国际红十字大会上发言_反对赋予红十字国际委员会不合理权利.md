Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 6th - The International Red Cross Conference held a joint meeting of the Representative Committee and the Council on the morning of the 4th, and a plenary meeting in the afternoon. At the meetings, the reports and resolutions passed by several committees, including General Affairs, Relief, Health Care and Social Assistance, and Youth, as well as the Legal Sub-Committee, were presented for study and approval.

On the morning of the 4th, when the draft amendment to the International Red Cross Charter passed by the Legal Sub-Committee was put to a vote, Li Dequan, chief delegate of the Chinese Red Cross Society delegation, once again emphasized that the draft charter grants unreasonable rights to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is very wrong. She said: "The International Committee of the Red Cross is only a group of twenty-five Swiss citizens, and not democratically elected by the national Red Cross societies. Therefore, this organization must not be placed above the national Red Cross societies, controlling their work. Moreover, the committee's own actions have proven that it is biased and has abandoned the principles of the Geneva Conventions." The Soviet and Romanian delegations spoke out in agreement.

At the plenary meeting in the afternoon, when the meeting heard the reports and adopted resolutions of the Health Care and Social Assistance Committee and the Relief Committee, Wu Yunfu, representative of the Chinese Red Cross Society delegation, said: "The Chinese Red Cross Society delegation suggested last week in the Relief Committee to provide relief to the famine-stricken people of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. This suggestion is entirely based on the serious and urgent needs of the people in the famine areas, and it is entirely in line with the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross - to eliminate human suffering. In order to respect and widely absorb various opinions, we have discussed with the representatives of Canada and Australia. As a result, the three delegations unanimously agreed on a revised draft resolution. However, when this revised draft was submitted to the Relief Committee for further discussion, the Canadian representative reversed his original idea, so the final resolution did not mention the serious famine relief in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. The Chinese delegation also voted in favor of this resolution at the time, but at the same time, we cannot help but feel deeply regret that the suffering of the people of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa has been ignored, and we express our reservations on this point."

    李德全在国际红十字大会上发言
    反对赋予红十字国际委员会不合理权利
    【新华社多伦多六日电】国际红十字大会在四日上午举行代表委员会和理事会的联席会议，在下午举行全体会议。会议上，总务、救济、保健护理及社会救助、青少年等几个委员会以及法律小组委员会所通过的报告和决议都提了出来，让会议研究和批准。
    四日上午，当法律小组委员会所通过的修改国际红十字章程的提案付诸表决时，中国红十字会代表团首席代表李德全再次强调提出：章程草案赋予红十字国际委员会不合理的权利，是很不对的。她说：“红十字国际委员会只是二十五个瑞士公民组成的团体，而不是由各国红十字会经过民主选举产生的，因此决不能让这个组织的地位处在各国红十字会之上，控制它们的工作，更不要提这个委员会自己的所作所为已经证明它是偏私的，而且还是抛弃了日内瓦公约的原则的了。”苏联和罗马尼亚代表团都发言表示同样的态度。
    在下午的全体会议上，当会议听取保健护理及社会救助委员会和救济委员会的报告及所通过的决议时，中国红十字会代表团代表伍云甫发言说：“中国红十字会代表团上星期在救济委员会上建议救济东南亚、中东和北非的饥荒人民，这建议完全基于饥荒地区人民的严重而急迫的需要，而且完全符合红十字会的人道原则——消除人类的痛苦。为了尊重并广泛吸收各种不同的意见，我们曾经和加拿大和澳大利亚代表商讨过。结果，三国代表团一致同意了一个修正的决议草案。然而，当这个修正草案再次提交救济委员会进一步讨论时，加拿大代表却一反他原来的主意，所以最后通过的决议完全没有提到要救济东南亚、中东和北非的严重灾荒。中国代表团当时也投票同意这个决议，但是同时我们却不能不为东南亚、中东和北非人民的痛苦之受到忽视而深感遗憾，并对这一点表示保留。”
