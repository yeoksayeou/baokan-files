    Learning from the Wen County Court Incident
    -- Summary of Readers' Letters
    Following the report "Pingyuan Province Exposes Serious Violations of Law and Discipline in Wen County Court Case" on page three of this newspaper on July 21st, readers from various locations have continuously written letters expressing their support for the people's government's execution of the main culprits in the case, Wang Gaosheng and others, and have offered opinions on issues such as the judicial organs conducting inspections of bureaucratic work styles in connection with this case.
    Xia Shengqian from the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League wrote, "In today's era, it is intolerable that there are still individuals like Wang Gaosheng in the organs of the people's government who harm the interests of the people. The people's government's handling of the Wen County Court case is completely correct." Gao Naifu from the Jiankang Road Post Office in Nanjing wrote, "The party and government leading organs in Wen County should thoroughly examine bureaucratic practices, trace the roots of the problem, and restore the prestige of the party and the people's government among the masses." Qiu Zhongxun from Zhongbeixie Village, Tianjin County, Hebei Province, suggested "establishing a people's complaint mailbox within the Supreme People's Court, assigning a dedicated person to be in charge, and accepting people's complaints about violations of law and discipline by staff members of various levels of organs." Zhu Junhua, Wu Xihua, Shen Xinchi, Qin Zhongqi and others from the Su'nan District Farmers' Association wrote: "The People's Court should only be an institution that serves the people, and it must not become a tool for oppressing the people. We will never allow elements like Wang Gaosheng, who are domineering and overbearing, to be entrenched in the People's Court." Zhang Xipo from the Department of Law at Renmin University of China wrote: "The People's Court is a tool for consolidating the people's government. The people demand that every judicial worker of the people have a pragmatic work style and revolutionary moral qualities. The criminals in the Wen County Court case have become dregs among judicial personnel and must be swept away. Courts in various localities should also use this incident to thoroughly examine the illegal and undisciplined situations of the staff in their departments and seriously deal with them."

    接受温县法院事件的教训
    ——读者来信综述
    七月二十一日本报第三版报道了“平原省揭发温县法院严重违法乱纪案件”后，各地读者连续来信表示拥护人民政府对该案主犯王高升等执行枪决的判处，并对司法机关应结合这一案件进行官僚主义作风的检查等问题提出了意见。
    青年团湖南省工作委员会夏胜千来信说：“在今天，人民政权的机关中还有王高升这样危害人民利益的家伙，这是不能令人容忍的。人民政府对温县法院案件的处理是完全正确的。”南京市建康路邮局高乃富来信说：“温县党、政领导机关应该彻底检查官僚主义，追根求源，以挽回党和人民政府在群众中的威信。”河北省天津县中北斜村邱钟洵来信建议“在最高人民法院内设立人民检举信箱，委派专人负责掌管，接受人民对各级机关工作人员违法乱纪事件的检举”。苏南区农民协会朱俊华、吴锡华、沈辛墀、秦中奇等来信说：“人民法院只应该是为人民办事的机构，而不能成为压迫人民的工具。我们决不容许在人民法院内还盘据着像王高升这样横行霸道的分子。”中国人民大学法律系张希坡来信说：“人民法院是巩固人民政权的工具。人民要求每一个人民的司法工作者都有实事求是的作风，都有革命的道德品质。像温县法院的那些罪犯，已经成为司法人员中的败类，必须予以扫除。各地法院也应通过这一事件，彻底检查一下本部门工作人员的违法乱纪情形，并加以认真处理。”
