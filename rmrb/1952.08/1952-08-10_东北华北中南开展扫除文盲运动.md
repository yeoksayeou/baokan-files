    Literacy Campaigns Launched in Northeast, North, and Central-South China
    [By Our Newspaper] Currently, rapid literacy methods are being vigorously promoted in a planned manner across the country, launching literacy campaigns. Following the Northeast People's Government Education Department and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions jointly convening a conference on promoting rapid literacy methods in May, and the Northwest Region convening a conference on workers and peasants education in June to discuss promoting rapid literacy methods, the Central-South and North China regions also convened regional conferences in July to discuss vigorously launching literacy campaigns. The Northeast Region also recently established a regional literacy campaign committee to strengthen leadership in promoting rapid literacy methods and launching literacy campaigns.
    From July 1st to 6th, the Central-South Military and Political Committee Education Department and the Central-South Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee jointly convened a conference on promoting rapid literacy methods. At the meeting, Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, and Zhao Yimin, Director of the Culture and Education Committee, delivered reports respectively, providing clear and detailed instructions on the significance, conditions, methods, and steps of promoting rapid literacy methods and launching worker-peasant literacy campaigns. The conference finally formulated a specific plan for promoting rapid literacy methods in the region, deciding to eliminate illiteracy among worker-peasant cadres in the region within two years, eliminate illiteracy among workers within five years, and universally eliminate illiteracy among peasants within ten years. After the meeting, Central-South regions, based on the spirit of the meeting and combined with local conditions, formulated plans for further promoting rapid literacy methods and are preparing to train a large number of teachers. For example, Hunan Province began organizing 42 outstanding teachers who attended the regional conference at the Culture and Education Department to study from July 8th. On July 13th, it also began organizing some full-time teachers transferred from various special districts to study. At the same time, it plans to train a large number of full-time teachers in conjunction with worker-peasant teacher training classes, and to train full-time teachers of employee schools across the province in stages, as the backbone for carrying out the rapid literacy campaign.
    The North China Administrative Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council held a meeting on July 28th to discuss the issue of promoting rapid literacy methods throughout the North China region. Wei Zhen, Deputy Director of the Culture and Education Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee, reported on the situation of promoting rapid literacy methods in the North China region and put forward requirements and steps for carrying out literacy campaigns in the future. Before July 1st, more than 5,800 experimental classes had been opened in the North China region, with a total of approximately 275,000 people initially succeeding in learning. In Tianjin, 160,000 workers and citizens have graduated from experimental classes. The broad masses of workers and peasants have shown great enthusiasm and joy in rapid literacy learning. Cultural learning has enabled them to see a bright future, and labor enthusiasm has also risen unprecedentedly. Various places have demonstrated great ambition and determination in carrying out this movement. At a conference of more than 1,200 people in Hebei Province in July to promote rapid literacy, it was required that illiteracy among cadres above the district level be completely eliminated before October, and efforts should be made to eliminate illiteracy among 10 million peasants within three years. The Party's leading organs and the People's Governments in various provinces are determined to solve this problem of eliminating illiteracy, which has been a long-standing problem in Chinese history, within a few years. The meeting discussed the guiding principles, requirements, steps, teacher training, organizational leadership, and other issues related to promoting the literacy campaign. Qi Jianhua, the creator of the rapid literacy method, was invited to speak at the meeting.
    At the conclusion of the North China Region conference on promoting rapid literacy methods, Director Liu Lantao pointed out that the key to carrying out the literacy campaign lies first in strong leadership, being able to attach importance to it ideologically, and providing the necessary personnel and funding to ensure the development of the campaign. Secondly, it is necessary to implement the leadership method of the mass line, organize all possible cultural forces, and form a strong army to eliminate illiteracy, to meet the needs of a large-scale literacy campaign. Liu Lantao finally pointed out: After this task is determined, it must be actively and resolutely implemented. In the beginning, it is necessary to grasp the key points, gain experience, and promote it on a large scale. The region's more than 60 million peasants should become the focus of eliminating illiteracy, because peasants are the source of workers, soldiers, and cadres. He requested that the Government Administration Council's North China Administrative Committee formulate a plan for promoting rapid literacy methods throughout the region based on the conditions of each province, and gradually promote its realization. In realizing this great task, on the one hand, we must see various favorable conditions, and on the other hand, we must fully see the difficulties that may be encountered. It is wrong to adopt a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude or a rash and impetuous attitude towards Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method. The North China Region Rapid Literacy Committee was formally established at the meeting, with Liu Lantao, Director of the North China Administrative Committee, serving as the director, and Zhang Su, Deputy Director of the North China Administrative Committee, and Zhang Panshi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, serving as deputy directors. The Literacy Committee established an office under it.
    The Northeast Region has now established a literacy campaign committee. The literacy campaign committee held its first meeting on July 29th, studying and determining the implementation plan for the Northeast Region to promote rapid literacy methods and carry out literacy campaigns, and put forward solutions to the existing problems in the current work and the guidelines and methods for further carrying out the work in the future. Since mid-May, the preparatory work for promoting rapid literacy methods in the Northeast region has made great progress in the past two months. Provinces and cities, and various industrial systems have vigorously carried out the work of training teachers and focusing on pilot rapid literacy classes, and have trained more than 60,000 cadres and teachers, and have created many practical experiences from them. At present, the main industrial and mining sectors have largely entered the stage of gradual promotion, and the rural areas have entered the stage of training teachers in counties and districts and focusing on pilot implementation. However, some serious problems have also arisen in the work: the main ones are the deviations of being eager for quick results and acting rashly; there are also a few areas where there is a phenomenon of being stable but not advancing, one-sidedly emphasizing pilot projects, and the leadership's strength is trapped in pilot work for a long time, while relaxing the necessary control and guidance over the overall work, reducing the effectiveness of the preparatory work. In addition, there is a phenomenon of one-sidedly emphasizing "easy to learn" and "learn quickly" in propaganda work, while neglecting to inspire the masses' consciousness, initiative, and fighting spirit in learning. In teaching work, there is a more common deviation of formalism, such as mechanically transporting and applying certain teaching forms, simply pursuing speed and not paying attention to actual results. The main reasons for these deviations are that some culture and education departments and culture and education workers have unclear ideas, lack a deep understanding of the rapid literacy method itself and the policy of promoting it step by step from point to surface, and regard the promotion of rapid literacy method as a purely technical problem, while relaxing the arduous and meticulous work and ideological leadership. In order to effectively improve the work and strengthen the leadership in promoting rapid literacy methods and carrying out literacy campaigns, the Northeast Literacy Campaign Committee proposed that: all localities in the region should establish leading bodies of literacy campaign committees at the provincial (municipal), county, district, and village levels. The literacy campaign committees of the provinces and cities must be established quickly, and those below the county and district levels should be established gradually according to the working principle of steady progress, to avoid falling into formalism. At the same time, the Northeast Literacy Campaign Committee, in view of the fact that a large number of illiterate people will soon become non-illiterate after the promotion of rapid literacy method, proposed that preparations should be made as soon as possible for the consolidation and improvement work after the elimination of illiteracy, and instructed the office to start drafting specific plans and measures related to this work.

    东北华北中南开展扫除文盲运动
    【本报讯】全国各地目前正有计划地大力推行速成识字法，开展扫除文盲运动。继五月间东北人民政府教育部和东北总工会联合召开推行速成识字法会议、六月间西北区召开讨论推行速成识字法的工农教育会议之后，中南区和华北区也在七月间分别召开了全区性的会议，讨论大力开展扫除文盲运动。东北区也于日前成立了全区识字运动委员会，加强对推行速成识字法、开展识字运动的领导。
    七月一日至六日，中南军政委员会教育部和中南总工会筹备委员会联合召开推行速成识字法会议。会上中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢、文教委员会主任赵毅敏分别作了报告，对推行速成识字法、开展工农识字运动的意义、条件、方法和步骤等，作了明确和详尽的指示。会议最后制定了全区推行速成识字法的具体计划，决定两年以内扫除全区工农干部中的文盲，五年以内扫除工人中的文盲，十年以内普遍扫除农民中的文盲。会后，中南各地根据会议精神，结合各地具体情况，制定进一步推行速成识字法的计划，并正着手进行大量培养师资的准备工作。如湖南省自七月八日开始组织出席全区会议的优秀教师四十二人在文教厅学习。七月十三日，又开始组织从各专区调来的部分专任教师学习，同时计划结合工农师资训练班训练大批专任教师，并分期轮训全省在职职工学校专任教师，作为开展速成识字运动的骨干。
    中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会于七月二十八日举行会议，讨论在华北全区推行速成识字法问题。华北行政委员会文教局副局长魏震在会上报告了华北区推行速成识字法的情况并提出今后开展识字运动的要求与步骤。在七月一日以前，华北全区共开办了五千八百多个实验班，初步学习成功的共约二十七万五千多人。天津市已有十六万工人和市民从实验班毕业。广大工农群众对速成识字学习表现了高度的热情和喜悦。文化学习使他们看到了远大前途，劳动热情也空前高涨。各地对开展这一运动表现了很大的气魄和决心。河北省在七月召开的一千二百多人的推广速成识字大会上，要求在十月以前全部扫除区级以上干部中的文盲，争取三年内扫除农民文盲一千万人。各省党的领导机关和人民政府都有决心要在几年时间内解决这个中国历史上长期不能解决的扫除文盲问题。会议讨论了推行识字运动的方针、要求、步骤以及师资培养、组织领导等问题。速成识字法的创造人祁建华应邀在会上讲了话。
    华北区推行速成识字法会议结束时，刘澜涛主任指出开展识字运动的关键，首先在于坚强的领导，能从思想上予以重视，并供应必需的人员和经费等，以保证运动的开展。其次必须贯彻群众路线的领导方法，组织一切可能组织的文化力量，组成一支强大的扫除文盲大军，适应大规模识字运动的需要。刘澜涛最后指出：这一任务确定之后，就要积极坚决贯彻完成，开始必须掌握重点，取得经验，大量推广。全区六千多万农民应成为扫除文盲重点，因为农民是工人、战士和干部的来源。他要求政务院华北行政委员会应根据各省情况制定全区推广速成识字法的计划，逐步推广实现。在实现这一伟大任务时，一方面要看到各种有利条件，同时也必须充分看到可能遇到的困难。对祁建华速成识字法采取怀疑观望态度和轻率急躁态度都是不对的。会上正式成立了华北区速成识字委员会，华北行政委员会主任刘澜涛任主任，华北行政委员会副主任张苏和中共中央华北局宣传部长张磐石任副主任，识字委员会下设办公室。
    东北区现已成立识字运动委员会。识字运动委员会于七月二十九日召开首次会议，研究并确定了东北区推行速成识字法、开展识字运动的实施计划，并提出了解决目前工作中所存在的问题和今后进一步开展工作的方针和办法。自五月中旬至现在两个多月来，东北全区推行速成识字法的准备工作已有很大成绩。各省市、各产业系统都大力进行了训练教员和重点试办速成识字班的工作，已训练出干部、教员六万余人，并从中创造了许多实际经验。目前主要的工、矿部门大体上已进入逐步推广阶段，农村方面已转入县、区的训练教员和重点试行阶段。但在工作中也产生了较为严重的问题：主要是急于求成、草率从事的偏向；也有少数地区有稳而不进的现象，片面强调试点，领导力量长期陷于试点工作中，对全面工作则放松了应有的掌握和指导，降低了准备工作的效果。此外，宣传工作上则有片面强调“容易学”和“赶快学”的现象，而忽视启发群众学习上的自觉性、积极性和斗争精神。在教学工作中，则是较普遍地存在着形式主义的偏向，如机械搬运和套用某些教学形式，单纯追求时间快，不注意实际效果。产生这些偏向的原因，主要的是某些文教部门和文教工作者思想不明确，对速成识字法本身以及由点到面稳步前进的推行方针缺乏深刻认识，把推行速成识字法看作单纯的技术问题，而放松了艰苦细致的工作和思想领导。为了有效地改进工作和加强推行速成识字法、开展识字运动的领导，东北识字运动委员会提出：全区各地应建立省（市）、县、区、村各级识字运动委员会的领导机构，目前各省、市的识字运动委员会须迅速建立，县、区以下则按稳步前进的工作方针逐步建立，避免流于形式。同时东北识字运动委员会鉴于推行速成识字法后不久即将有大批文盲变为非文盲，提出对于扫除文盲后的巩固提高工作应及早进行准备，并责成办公室着手拟订有关这一工作的具体计划和办法。
