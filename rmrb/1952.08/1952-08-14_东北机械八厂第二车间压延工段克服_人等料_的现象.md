To the Editorial Board:

    In the past, the rolling mill section of the second workshop of the Northeast No. 8 Machinery Factory often experienced workers waiting for materials because the heating furnace was too small and the amount of iron produced was insufficient. At the end of June this year, the workers renovated the heating furnace, increasing the amount of iron smelted per furnace from the original 150 pieces to 250 pieces, thus avoiding the phenomenon of workers waiting for materials. In addition, the distance between the heating furnace and the machinery has also been increased, avoiding cramped conditions during operation. The temperature of the furnace is also not as scorching as it used to be. These improvements have greatly increased the workers' enthusiasm for production.

    东北机械八厂第二车间压延工段克服“人等料”的现象
    编辑同志：东北机械八厂第二车间压延工段，过去由于加热炉太小，烧出的铁不够用，经常发生人等料的现象。今年六月底，职工们改修了加热炉，使每炉的烧铁量由原来的一百五十块，提高到二百五十块，避免了人等料的现象。另外加热炉和机械的距离也较前迁远了一些，避免了在操作方面的架手架脚现象。炉的温度也不像从前那样烤人了。这些改进，大大提高了职工们的生产热情。
