A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editor, People's Daily: We completely agree with the criticisms made by the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions' work team in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on July 18th regarding our factory's production management, labor protection, and other aspects. We will now explain our solutions as follows:

    (1) The problem of unreasonable production quotas and more penalties than rewards in administrative management, causing many skilled workers to be penalized and demoted to "probationary workers," does indeed exist. Our factory's production quotas and reward/punishment measures were established in May 1950. At that time, our starting point was to reduce substandard cloth and increase the rate of standard cloth. Looking back now, we did not solve the problem of high substandard cloth rates by improving workers' skills and strengthening political and ideological education, but instead used simple penalties to solve it, which was obviously wrong. After deep reflection, we announced in July that we would adopt new methods.

    (2) The issue of the administrative grassroots organization not adapting to the needs of production is also a fact. We are currently studying how to improve the organization to meet the needs of production.

    (3) Regarding the issues of high workshop temperatures, poor working conditions, excessive meeting times, and workers not being able to rest, some of these have already been resolved, and we are working to resolve others.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    晋生纺织厂着手解决生产管理和劳动保护问题
    编辑同志：人民日报七月十八日“读者来信”栏发表的山西省总工会工作组，对我厂生产管理、劳动保护等方面提出了批评，我们完全同意。现将我们解决的办法分述于后：
    （一）生产定额不合理，行政管理方面处罚多于奖励，使很多技工被处罚后降为“预备工”的情况确实存在。我厂生产定额及奖惩办法是一九五○年五月份规定的，当时我们的出发点是为了减少次布，增加正布率。现在检查起来，我们没有从提高职工技术、加强政治思想教育方面来解决次布多的问题，而用单纯的处罚来解决，这显然是错误的。我们经深刻检讨后，于七月份已宣布改用新办法。
    （二）关于行政基层组织不适应生产需要的问题，这也是事实。现我们正研究改进组织，以适应生产需要。
    （三）关于车间温度高、劳动条件差、会议时间多、工人不得休息的问题，到目前止，有的我们已经解决了，有的我们正设法解决。
