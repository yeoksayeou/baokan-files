    Korean Children Living in the Hungarian Capital
    In October of last year, two hundred Korean children who had lost their parents in the war arrived in Budapest at the invitation of the Hungarian government.
    They would study and live in Hungary under the care of the Hungarian government and people. At the Budapest station, the Korean children were warmly welcomed by representatives of the Hungarian government and people's organizations, and a group of Hungarian children. As they stepped out of the carriages carrying flowers, the Hungarian children's band, innocent and enthusiastic, played the solemn Internationale. The welcomers and the new little guests could not understand each other's languages, but they understood each other nonetheless. The Hungarian children clearly knew that these were the sons and daughters of Korean heroes whose parents had been killed by the American devils and whose homes had been destroyed by the American bandits. For the sake of revenge, they had even taken up arms to fight the invaders at such a young age.
    For more than half a year, these Korean children have received meticulous care and attention from the Hungarian government and people. Near Freedom Hill in Budapest, the Hungarian government specifically designated ten hectares of land to establish the Kim Il-sung School to accommodate them. There are verdant pine forests, green lawns, sunlit classrooms, spacious dormitories, cultural and recreational and sports facilities, as well as a medical room specifically established to take care of the children's health. The children live a happy and fulfilling life there.
    Under the guidance of four Korean teachers and eight Hungarian teachers, the children here are learning their native language, history, and geography, while also studying Hungarian language, history, and literature. The children are very diligent in their studies, as evidenced by their progress in learning Hungarian. When they first arrived in Hungary, they only knew one Hungarian word - Rákosi. Now, some of the older ones can understand the Hungarian teachers' lectures to some extent and have begun to study physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics in Hungarian.
    The children live a collective life in the school, and they have their own organization – the Young Pioneers. Among the schools in Budapest, Kim Il-sung School enjoys a very high reputation. If a Hungarian Young Pioneer group is able to go to the Korean children's school on Sunday for a get-together, it is the greatest pleasure for them. During the get-together, the Korean and Hungarian children play ball, dance, play chess, play games, and talk together.
    The children are particularly fond of literature, art, music, and dance. Some of them are learning the piano, and some have shown special talent in poetry and painting. Hungarian writers and artists often visit them and give them special help. In March of this year, one of them, a fourteen-year-old named Hong Eun-hyung, wrote a long poem in Korean dedicated to the sixtieth birthday of the Hungarian people's leader, Comrade Rákosi, and in June of this year, with the help of teachers and classmates, he has begun to translate his work into Hungarian.
    The children love their leader as much as they love their own fathers. They are constantly concerned about General Kim Il-sung and the people and struggles of their motherland. Because of this, the school has specially prepared a radio for the children that can receive both long and short wavelengths, so that they can listen to news about Korea broadcast by Pyongyang and Moscow every day.
    On April 4th, when celebrating Hungarian National Day, and on May 1st, when celebrating International Labor Day, people could see Korean children holding portraits of General Kim Il-sung and the Korean flag marching together with the parading crowds. Wherever these Korean children, who are cared for and loved by the Hungarian people, go, flowers and smiles greet them.
    These Korean children, who lost their parents due to the aggression of American imperialism, have regained happiness and tranquility under the care and attention of the Hungarian people. They will grow up there and be cultivated into useful talents for Korea.

### 生活在匈牙利首都的朝鲜孩子们

    生活在匈牙利首都的朝鲜孩子们
    去年十月间，在战争中失去了父母的两百名朝鲜儿童，应匈牙利政府的邀请，到达了布达佩斯。
    他们要在匈牙利政府和人民的照顾下，在匈牙利读书和生活。在布达佩斯的车站上，朝鲜儿童受到了匈牙利政府、人民团体的代表和一队匈牙利少年儿童们的热烈欢迎。当他们捧着鲜花从车箱里走下来的时候，天真而热情的匈牙利小朋友们的乐队奏起了庄严的国际歌。欢迎者和新来的小客人们不能互通语言，但是他们却是互相了解的。匈牙利儿童清楚地知道，这些就是父母被美国鬼子所杀害、家园被美国强盗所毁坏的朝鲜英雄们的儿女，为了复仇，他们即使在这样幼小的年纪，就曾经拿起武器打击过侵略者。
    半年多来，这些朝鲜儿童受到了匈牙利政府和人民的无微不至的关心和照顾。在临近布达佩斯的自由山上，匈牙利政府特地辟出了十公顷的地方，建立了一所金日成学校，来安顿他们。那里有青翠的松林，碧绿的草地，阳光充足的课室，宽敞的宿舍，还有文化娱乐和体育设备以及专门为了照顾孩子们的健康而设立的医疗室。孩子们就在那里过着愉快幸福的生活。
    在四名朝鲜教员和八名匈牙利教员的指导下，孩子们在这里学习着本国的语文、历史、地理，同时也学匈牙利的语文、历史和文学方面的课程。孩子们对于学习是很努力的，这可以从他们学习匈牙利文的进度上表现出来。在刚到匈牙利的时候，他们只懂得一个匈牙利文字——拉科西。而现在，他们中间的一些年龄较大的已能够初步地听懂匈牙利教员们的讲话，并开始用匈牙利文来学习物理、化学、生物和数学了。
    孩子们在学校中过着集体的生活，他们有自己的组织——少年先锋队。在布达佩斯的学校中间，金日成学校有着很高的声誉。如果那一个匈牙利少年先锋队的小组能够在星期日去和朝鲜小朋友们联欢的话，对于他们来说那就是最大的愉快。在联欢的时候，朝鲜的和匈牙利的小朋友们在一起打球，跳舞，下棋，做游戏和谈话。
    孩子们特别喜爱文学、艺术、音乐和舞蹈。他们中间有些人正在学钢琴，有些人在诗歌和绘画方面表现出特别的才能。匈牙利的作家和艺术家们常常访问他们，给他们以特别的帮助。今年三月间，他们中间的一个十四岁的孩子洪恩炯，用朝鲜文写了一首献给匈牙利人民领袖拉科西同志六十岁寿辰的长诗，而在今年六月，他在教员和同学的帮助下，已经开始把自己的作品翻译成匈牙利文了。
    孩子们像热爱自己的父亲一样热爱自己的领袖。他们每时每刻都在关心着金日成将军，关心着祖国的人民和斗争。因为这样，学校特地为孩子们准备了一个无线电收音机，能收长短波长的广播，好让他们每天都能收听到平壤和莫斯科所广播的关于朝鲜的消息。
    在今年四月四日庆祝匈牙利国庆日的时候，在庆祝五一国际劳动节的时候，人们可以看到高举着金日成将军画像和朝鲜国旗的朝鲜儿童们和游行的群众队伍一起前进。这些被匈牙利人民所关怀和热爱的朝鲜孩子们走到那里，鲜花和微笑就在那里迎接他们。
    这些因遭受美帝国主义的侵略而失去了父母的朝鲜孩子们，在匈牙利人民的关怀与照顾下，重新得到了幸福和安宁。他们将在那里长大起来，被培养成朝鲜的有用的人材。
