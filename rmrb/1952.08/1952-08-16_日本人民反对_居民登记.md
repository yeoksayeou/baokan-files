    Japanese People Oppose "Resident Registration"
    From July 1st to 5th, the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan implemented the so-called "Resident Registration" nationwide. Its purpose was to strengthen political oppression of the Japanese people, prepare for the restoration of the conscription system, and facilitate the implementation of a harsh taxation system.
    The so-called "Resident Registration" forces every Japanese citizen to fill in their name, address, and other information on a resident registration card. It is normally compared with the household registration, and detailed investigations are carried out when moving. It also stipulates that every citizen must carry a "Resident Registration Card" with them. The so-called "Forced Investigators" have the right to question pedestrians anywhere on the street, just like the former military police. In order to implement this fascist measure, the Yoshida government used a budget of 360 million yen.
    The Japanese people carried out fierce struggles against resident registration throughout the country. Twelve universities in Tokyo, including Tokyo University, resolved to refuse registration. On July 3rd, 300 students in Tokyo gathered at Shibuya Station and burned 2,000 "Resident Registration Cards" on the spot. More than 1,000 workers, students, and citizens in Tokyo held a lecture meeting. The Yoshida government dispatched 150 police officers to attack the participating masses. The residents of Kushiro City and Kamikawa Town in Hokkaido unanimously resolved to return their "Resident Registration Cards." All 637 households in Hinocho 3-chome, Matsuzaka City, Mie Prefecture, refused to register. All the investigators also resigned in opposition to resident registration. The Women's Association of Maidashi Town in Fukuoka launched a campaign for all residents to unanimously return their registration cards in order to oppose conscription. In Kyoto, the Municipal Workers' Union also resolved to refuse registration. The Japanese people's struggle against resident registration is part of the struggle against conscription and against re-militarization. The "Peace Movement Month" is currently underway throughout Japan, actively promoting the anti-conscription movement.

    日本人民反对“居民登记”
    七月一日至五日，日本吉田反动政府在全国实施了所谓“居民登记”，其目的是为了加强对日本人民的政治压迫，准备恢复征兵制，并便于实行严酷的征税制度。
    所谓“居民登记”是强制每一个日本国民在居民登记证上填好姓名、住址及其他事项，平常与户籍对照，迁移时还要详细调查，并规定每一个国民要随身携带“居民登记证”。所谓“强制调查官”有权在路上随地盘问行人，就像从前的宪兵一样。吉田政府为了实行这个法西斯措施，曾使用了三亿六千万日元的预算。
    日本人民在全国各地进行了反对居民登记的激烈斗争。东京的东京大学等十二个大学都决议拒绝登记。七月三日，东京有学生三百人在涩谷车站集合，当场烧毁了两千张“居民登记证”。东京工人、学生、市民一千多人举行了讲演会，吉田政府竟出动一百五十名警察，对与会群众实行攻击。北海道钏路市和上川町的居民全体一致决议退回“居民登记证”。三重县松板市日野町三丁目的住民六百三十七家全体拒绝登记。调查员也反对居民登记而全体辞职了。福冈的马出町妇女会为了反对征兵，发动全体居民一致退回登记证。在京都，市工会也决议拒绝登记。日本人民反对居民登记的斗争是反对征兵、反对重新军国主义化斗争的一部分。现在日本全国各地正在进行“和平运动月”，积极推进反对征兵运动。
