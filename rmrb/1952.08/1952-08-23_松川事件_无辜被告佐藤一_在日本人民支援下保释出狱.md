Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: Satoichi, one of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" who was persecuted by the Japanese reactionaries and became ill, was released on bail on July 3rd thanks to the unanimous demands of the Japanese people.

Satoichi was illegally arrested and imprisoned by the Yoshida government in 1949. During three years of unjust imprisonment, Satoichi suffered from severe pulmonary tuberculosis and later contracted dysentery. As early as last year, the defendant's defense lawyers, based on a hospital certificate, requested the Sendai High Court to terminate Satoichi's detention so that he could be released for treatment. However, this reasonable request was unreasonably rejected by the Sendai High Court authorities at that time. As a result, Satoichi's condition continued to deteriorate, and his life was in danger.

The Japanese people expressed extreme concern after learning about Satoichi's condition. Trade unions, farmers' organizations, democratic groups, student groups, and youth and women's organizations across the country unanimously demanded that the Sendai High Court immediately release the ailing Satoichi. The defendant's defense lawyers' team also demanded an immediate end to Satoichi's detention. Under the demands and pressure of the people nationwide, the Sendai High Court was finally forced to grant Satoichi bail on July 3rd.

After his release, Satoichi expressed his sincere gratitude for the just support of the people across the country and resolutely said: "I will continue to fight tenaciously in the future."

    “松川事件”无辜被告佐藤一
    在日本人民支援下保释出狱
    【新华社讯】东京消息：被日本反动派迫害致病的“松川事件”无辜被告之一佐藤一，在日本人民的一致要求下，已经在七月三日保释出狱。
    佐藤一是在一九四九年被吉田政府非法逮捕入狱的。在三年冤狱生活中，佐藤一患了严重的肺结核病，后来又患痢疾。被告辩护律师早在去年就根据医院的证明，要求仙台高等裁判所对佐藤一终止拘押，使他能够出狱治病。但是，这个合理的要求当时竟被仙台高等裁判所当局无理拒绝。因此佐藤一的病情日益恶化，生命处于危险的状态中。
    日本人民得悉佐藤一的病情以后，表示极度关怀。全国的工会、农民组织、民主团体、学生团体、青年妇女组织等，一致要求仙台高等裁判所迅速释放患病的佐藤一，被告辩护律师团也要求立即停止对佐藤一的拘押。在全国人民的要求和压力下，仙台高等裁判所终于在七月三日被迫准许保释佐藤一。
    佐藤一在出狱后，对全国人民的正义支援表示十分感谢，他坚决地说：“今后还要顽强地进行斗争”。
