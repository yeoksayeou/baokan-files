    CCP Fuping County Committee of Shaanxi Province Conducts Self-Criticism for Neglecting the Study of Current Events by Leading Cadres

    To the Editor: Many staff members of various agencies in Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, do not pay attention to reading newspapers and studying. Recently, we tested the current affairs learning of cadres at the county level. The questions were very simple, but many people could not answer them or answered them incorrectly. Two hundred and eighteen people participated in the test, but only thirty-seven passed, and many submitted blank papers. Judging from the situation in various departments, cadres in administrative departments read newspapers better, while cadres in enterprise departments read newspapers the worst. Many people revealed various confused ideas in their answers. Many cadres directly leading agricultural production did not know what the three main forms of agricultural cooperation and mutual assistance were. Some said they were "drought prevention and resistance, rushing to plant, and rushing to harvest," "mutual aid groups, reading groups, and people's schools," and others said they were "farm tools, waterwheels, and fertilizers," or "working together during busy farming seasons and individually during slack seasons, working together on major tasks and individually on minor tasks." One-third of the people did not know what the Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was about, and the answers of the remaining two-thirds were also mostly incorrect. Some people said that the meeting was "initiated by Malik and held in New York," and others said that it was "initiated by Curie and held in Vienna." How serious is this lack of general current affairs knowledge!

    The study of newspapers by机关 cadres has not been done well, and the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee should be mainly responsible. During this year's spring plowing production, we discovered that some leading cadres did not read the newspapers, and therefore did not understand the basic principles of this year's agricultural production. However, we did not pay attention to it at the time. After the People's Daily criticized the phenomenon of neglecting reading newspapers, we have not been vigilant. The higher-level Party committee instructed us to strengthen the leadership of the cadres' reading and study of newspapers, but we have not seriously implemented this instruction. This not only shows that we do not care about the political and current affairs study of cadres, but also shows that we have committed errors of disorganization and lack of discipline. Although some cadres have a purely professional point of view and a tendency not to ask about politics, this is not the main reason for neglecting the phenomenon of reading newspapers. In this test, we deeply felt that leadership's emphasis is the key to doing a good job in reading newspapers and studying. In the future, we must strengthen the leadership of the staff's reading and study of newspapers, so as to change the situation of thin political air in the agencies.

    中共陕西富平县委检讨忽视领导干部时事学习
    编辑同志：陕西省富平县各机关许多工作人员不注意读报学习。最近，我们测验了县级各机关干部的时事学习情况。出的题目很简单，但有许多人却答不出或答不对。参加测验的有二百一十八人，只有三十七人及格，有不少人交了白卷。从各部门情况看来，行政部门的干部读报情况较好，企业部门的干部读报情况最差。许多人在答案中，暴露了各种混乱思想。很多直接领导农业生产工作的干部，不知道三种农业合作互助的主要形式是什么。有人说是“防旱抗旱、抢种、抢收”“变工组、读报组、民校”，有人说是“农具、水车、肥料”，有人说是“农忙伙干农闲单干，农业伙干副业单干，大活伙干小活单干”。有三分之一的人不知道亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议是怎么回事，其余三分之二的人的答案也多不正确。有些人说这个会是“马立克发起的，在纽约举行”，有人说是“居里发起的，在维也纳举行”。这种缺乏一般时事常识的现象，是多么严重呵！
    机关干部的读报学习一直没有搞好，主要应由县委宣传部负责。在今年春耕生产中，我们即发现某些领导干部不读报，因此不了解今年农业生产的基本方针。但是，当时我们并没有加以注意。人民日报对忽视读报的现象提出批评以后，我们还没有警惕起来。上级党委指示我们对机关干部的读报学习加强领导，我们还没有认真执行这个指示。这不仅说明我们对干部的政治和时事学习不关心，而且说明我们犯了无组织、无纪律的错误。某些干部虽然存在着单纯业务观点和不问政治的倾向，但这不是造成忽视读报现象的主要原因。在这次测验中，我们深深感到领导重视是搞好读报学习的关键。今后，我们一定要加强对机关工作人员读报学习的领导，以便改变机关中政治空气稀薄的情况。
