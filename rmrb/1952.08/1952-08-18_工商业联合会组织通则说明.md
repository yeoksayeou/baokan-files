Explanation of the Organizational Regulations for the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce
(Report made at the 147th Meeting of the Government Administration Council on August 1, 1952, and approved at the same meeting)
Xue Muqiao, Director of the Central Private Enterprise Bureau

Today, on behalf of the Central Private Enterprise Bureau, I am presenting the draft Organizational Regulations for the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, hoping for approval and promulgation. Now, for the sake of facilitating discussion, I will briefly explain to the Government Administration Council some of the issues we considered when drafting these regulations and the basic spirit of these regulations.

First is the issue of the nature and tasks of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Article 1 of the Organizational Regulations stipulates that "The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is a people's organization jointly formed by various types of industrialists and businessmen." The so-called various types of industrialists and businessmen here include state-owned enterprises and cooperatives, private enterprises, and joint state-private enterprises. Among these categories, it goes without saying that private industrialists and businessmen constitute the majority, and they need such an organization to maintain close contact with the government more than state-owned enterprises and cooperatives do. Therefore, in the local Federations of Industry and Commerce, private industrialists and businessmen are the most numerous. This is in line with the actual situation and actual needs. However, China's New Democratic economy is an organic whole, and the private economy cannot prosper independently without state-owned economy and cooperatives. The private economy needs the leadership and assistance of the state-owned economy and needs to cooperate with the cooperatives through division of labor. Therefore, state-owned enterprises and cooperatives should also participate in the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and assume certain responsibilities within this organization.

Now, our All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is different from the old chambers of commerce in the past. It is an organization of various types of industrialists and businessmen in a New Democratic country, and it undertakes two aspects of tasks: On the one hand, it "leads industrialists and businessmen to abide by the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government," and on the other hand, it "represents the legitimate interests of private industrialists and businessmen, reflects opinions and suggestions to the People's Government or relevant authorities." In addition, it should also "guide private industrialists and businessmen to develop production and improve management under the state's overall economic plan," represent private industrialists and businessmen "to negotiate with trade unions on labor-management relations and other issues," and "organize industrialists and businessmen to study, transform their thinking, and participate in various patriotic movements." All of the above tasks are in line with the interests of the state and the people, and also in line with the interests of the industrialists and businessmen themselves. If private industry and commerce abide by the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government, and conform to the state's overall economic plan, they can develop soundly; this is the path that private industry and commerce in New Democratic countries must follow. Therefore, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has the responsibility to educate private industrialists and businessmen with the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government, and guide them to develop in a direction that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Secondly, how to ensure that large, medium, and small industrialists and businessmen each find their place. It should be acknowledged that large industrial and commercial households, especially large factories, have more employees, larger output, and higher technology, and occupy an important position in the economy; however, small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households should also be given appropriate consideration because of their large number. The old chambers of commerce before liberation were often controlled and monopolized by a few upper-level large households, and small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen not only did not enjoy equal rights, but even did not get the opportunity to speak. This situation has been improved to some extent after liberation, and everyone has begun to pay attention to taking care of small and medium-sized industries and small and medium-sized enterprises, especially after Premier Zhou raised the issue of enabling small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen to enjoy equal rights at the Third Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last October, this issue has attracted more attention from the local Federations of Industry and Commerce. However, two years of experience have shown that in large cities and general medium-sized cities, it is actually difficult for one Federation of Industry and Commerce to take care of large, medium, and small enterprises in the whole city. In order to alleviate this difficulty, district offices of the Federation of Industry and Commerce have recently been established in some cities to contact small and medium-sized enterprises through these district offices. This method partially solves this problem. However, because the offices are not democratically elected, they cannot fully represent the interests of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, Article 9 of the Organizational Regulations stipulates that "In large and medium-sized cities where industry and commerce are relatively developed, the municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce may establish district Federations of Industry and Commerce or district branches," becoming a level of organization of the Federation of Industry and Commerce.

In large and medium-sized cities, the municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce is a unified organization of the industrial and commercial circles of the whole city, which plays a general role in political and economic mobilization and promotion, and centrally reflects the problems and opinions of various strata of the industrial and commercial circles. In terms of economic activities, its focus should be on city-wide and industry-wide (i.e., related to more than two industries) activities; in the government's processing, ordering, purchasing, and exclusive sales for various industries, it can play a role in guaranteeing and supervising. After the establishment of district-level organizations, the municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce can reflect the opinions of representatives of the industrial and commercial circles at the municipal level to a greater extent, and can use more strength to take care of large industrial and commercial enterprises that occupy a particularly important position in the city, while the district Federation of Industry and Commerce or district branch mainly takes care of small and medium-sized enterprises in the district, and becomes an organization that can truly reflect the opinions of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen and represent the interests of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen; in this way, large, medium, and small industrialists and businessmen in the whole city can truly achieve their respective roles. The district Federation of Industry and Commerce or district branch is organizationally led by the municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and follows the decisions and instructions of the municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce on issues related to the whole city; however, the district Federation of Industry and Commerce or district branch should maintain considerable independence within its district. All levels of Federations of Industry and Commerce are in a hierarchical relationship, and they are also subject to the supervision and guidance of the People's Government at the same level.

In small cities with tens of thousands of people, the number of private industrial and commercial households is not large, the difference between large and small is not large, and the contradictions are not sharp. The municipal or county Federation of Industry and Commerce can directly lead all industrialists and businessmen through industry organizations.

Third is the issue of the nature and status of trade associations. Trade associations are long-standing organizations in the industrial and commercial circles, and in the past, they were member units of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. They had greater feudal guild characteristics before liberation. After liberation, some trade associations have been initially transformed, especially the "Five-Anti" movement has played a considerable role in promoting the transformation of trade associations. However, in terms of organization, trade associations are still independent organizations. They represent the industrial and commercial households in their respective industries to participate in the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and their income and expenditure and the appointment and removal of cadres are not supervised by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, which undermines the unity of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. Therefore, Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Organizational Regulations stipulates that "The municipal and county Federations of Industry and Commerce shall have as members the state-owned, private, and joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises, cooperatives, or cooperative federations within the area of the municipality or county"; that is to say, the Federation of Industry and Commerce no longer takes trade associations as its members, but directly absorbs industrial and commercial households as its members. However, this does not mean to abolish the organization of trade associations, but to change the nature of trade associations and turn them into professional organizations under the leadership of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. This change creates more favorable conditions for further eliminating the feudal guild nature of trade associations.

After thorough reorganization, trade associations still have an important role to play in handling public-private relations, labor-management relations, organizing processing and ordering, and in the future implementation of a planned economy by the state. Therefore, in large and medium-sized cities, the organization of trade associations can be continued to be preserved in industries that have a role in the national economy. For certain industries with similar business operations and a small number of households, they can be appropriately merged under the voluntary principle of industrialists and businessmen. For some scattered small industries, trade committees can be maintained without establishing an office according to the will of the majority of industrialists and businessmen in the industry. When there are problems, the trade committee will consult to solve them. If there are major issues involving the entire industry, a general meeting or a representative meeting of the industry can be convened. The trade association can organize groups according to similar business or according to region; the industry groups in the district are under the dual leadership of the trade association and the district Federation of Industry and Commerce or the district branch. In large and medium-sized cities with district-level organizations, trade associations should mainly focus on economic activities, such as organizing various processing orders, implementing production and sales plans, evaluating tax burdens, and price negotiations in the same industry. All political activities of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen should be led by the district Federation of Industry and Commerce or the district branch. When they have disputes in the implementation of the decisions of the trade association or trade committee on economic aspects, they can also be assisted by the district Federation of Industry and Commerce or the district branch to resolve them.

Small cities with a small number of industrial and commercial households can set up trade committees and trade groups under the Federation of Industry and Commerce. All political and economic activities of the industrial and commercial circles, except for city-wide (county) and industry-wide activities that should be directly promoted by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, can be promoted through the trade committee. The industry group is an organization that assists the trade committee in promoting its work, not a level of organization, and cannot play an independent role.

Fourth is the organization of handicraftsmen, peddlers and vendors. In large and medium-sized cities, handicraftsmen (except those who have participated in trade associations or trade committees), peddlers and vendors generally do not need to establish city-wide joint organizations, but are respectively organized under the district Federation of Industry and Commerce or the district branch. If there are a large number of handicraftsmen, peddlers or vendors in a district, they can also establish a joint association of handicraftsmen, peddlers or vendors (vendors can also establish a joint association according to the market), and can be divided into groups by industry or by region. If some cities have already established city-wide joint associations of handicraftsmen, peddlers or vendors, they can maintain the status quo, and if there is no need to exist, they will be terminated when they voluntarily end. In order to take care of the interests of these small industrialists and businessmen, a number of representatives of handicraftsmen, peddlers and vendors can also be absorbed into the Federation of Industry and Commerce in large and medium-sized cities to form various specialized committees to study and guide their production and management issues. Small cities can organize handicraftsmen, peddlers and vendors into various trade committees and trade groups, or they can set up their own trade committees or trade groups.

The purpose of the above provisions is to make the Federation of Industry and Commerce truly a people's organization that obeys the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government and represents the interests of various types of industrialists and businessmen; to make large, medium, and small industries and large, medium, and small enterprises participating in the Federation of Industry and Commerce each find their place (provincial and national organizations should also take care of large, medium, and small cities); to strengthen the unity of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and clarify its internal division of labor. These are some of the more important issues we considered when drafting the Organizational Regulations of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. In addition, the articles are mostly based on the current practices in various places and there are no major changes, so no further explanation will be given.

    工商业联合会组织通则说明
    （一九五二年八月一日在政务院第一百四十七次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    中央私营企业局局长  薛暮桥
    今天我代表中央私营企业局，提出我们所起草的工商业联合会组织通则，希望核准公布。现在为着便于讨论，我把我们起草这个通则时曾经研究过的几个问题，和这个通则的基本精神，来向政务会议作一个简单的说明。
    首先是工商业联合会的性质和任务问题。组织通则第一条就规定，“工商业联合会是各类工商业者联合组成的人民团体”。这里所谓各类工商业者包括着国营企业和合作社、私营企业、公私合营企业等。在这各类中间，不言而喻私营工商业者占着多数，他们比国营企业和合作社更需要通过这样一个组织，来与政府密切联系。所以在各地的工商业联合会中，私营工商业者人数最多。这是符合于实际情况和实际需要的。但我国的新民主主义经济是一个有机的整体，私营经济不可能离开了国营经济和合作社而单独繁荣。私营经济需要国营经济来领导和帮助，并需要与合作社分工合作。因此国营企业和合作社亦应参加工商业联合会，并在这个组织中担负一定的责任。
    现在我们的工商业联合会与过去的旧商会不同，它是新民主主义国家各类工商业者的组织，它担负着两方面的任务：一方面是“领导工商业者遵守共同纲领及人民政府的政策法令”，另一方面是“代表私营工商业者的合法利益，向人民政府或有关机关反映意见，提出建议”。此外它还应该“指导私营工商业者在国家总的经济计划下，发展生产，改善经营”，代表私营工商业者“与工会协商有关劳资关系等问题”，“组织工商业者进行学习、改造思想和参加各种爱国运动”。以上各项任务，都是符合于国家和人民的利益，同时亦符合于工商业者自身的利益的。私营工商业如果遵守共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令，并符合于国家总的经济计划，是可以健全发展的；这是新民主主义国家的私营工商业所必须遵循的道路。因此工商业联合会有责任用共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令来教育私营工商业者，并引导他们朝着有利于国计民生的方向发展。
    其次是如何使大中小工商业者各得其所。应该承认，大工商户特别是大工厂职工多，产量大，技术高，在经济上确占重要地位；但中小工商业户则因户数众多，亦应予以适当的照顾。解放前的旧商会常常是由少数上层大户把持包办，中小工商业者不但享受不到平等权利，甚至得不到发言的机会。解放后这种情况已经有所改进，大家开始注意到要照顾中小行业和中小企业，特别是在去年十月政协全国委员会第三次全体会议中周总理提出要使中小工商业者享有平等权利以后，这个问题更引起各地工商业联合会的注意。但两年来的经验证明，在大城市和一般中等城市，由一个工商业联合会来照顾全市的大中小企业，事实上是有困难的。为着解除这个困难，近来在某些城市已成立了工商联的区办事处，通过这些区办事处来联系中小企业。这个办法，部分地解决了这个问题。但因办事处不是民主产生的，还不能完全代表中小工商业者的利益。因此组织通则第九条规定，“在工商业较发达的大、中城市，市工商业联合会得在区设立区工商业联合会或区分会”，成为工商联的一级组织。
    在大城市和中等城市，市工商联是全市工商界的统一组织，在政治上、经济上起一般号召、动员和推动的作用，并集中反映工商界各阶层的问题和意见。在经济活动方面，其重点应是全市性和通业性
    （即关系两个行业以上的）的活动；在政府对各行业进行加工、订货、代购、包销中，则可起保证和监督的作用。在成立了区一级的组织以后，市工商联便可以较多地反映市一级工商界代表人物的意见，并可以用较多的力量来照顾在全市中占特别重要地位的大工商业，而区工商联或区分会则主要照顾本区的中小企业，并成为确能反映中小工商业者意见，和代表中小工商业者的利益的组织；这样使全市的大中小工商业者真能达到各得其所。区工商联或区分会在组织上受市工商联领导，在有关全市的问题上遵行市工商联的决定和指示；但区工商联或区分会在本区的范围内应保持相当大的独立性。各级工商联均是上下级的关系，它们又受同级人民政府的监督和指导。
    在几万人口的小城市，私营工商业户数不多，大小之间差别不大，矛盾较不尖锐，可以由市或县工商联通过行业组织来直接领导全体工商业者。
    第三是同业公会的性质和地位问题。同业公会是工商界历久相沿的组织，过去且是工商业联合会的会员单位，它们在解放前有更大的封建行会性。解放后有些同业公会得到了初步的改造，特别是“五反”运动对同业公会的改造起着相当大的推动作用。但在组织上，同业公会仍然是各自独立的组织，它代表本行业的各工商户来参加工商业联合会，其经费的收支和干部的任免，均不受工商业联合会监督，这样就破坏了工商业联合会的统一性。所以组织通则第五条第一款规定“市、县工商业联合会以本市、县区域内的国营、私营及公私合营之工商企业、合作社或合作社联合社为会员”；这就是说工商业联合会不再以同业公会为其会员，而直接吸收工商业户为其会员。但这并不是要废弃同业公会这一组织，而是要把同业公会的性质改变，变为工商业联合会领导下的专业性的组织。这一改变，为进一步清除同业公会的封建行会性创造了更为有利的条件。
    同业公会在彻底改组后，对处理公私关系，劳资关系，组织加工订货，和在今后国家实行计划经济时，仍有其重要作用。因此，在大城市和中等城市，凡属对国家经济有作用的行业，可继续保存同业公会的组织。对某些经营业务相近，户数不多的行业，可以在工商业者的自愿原则下适当合并。对某些分散的小行业，则可以根据该行业大多数工商业者的自愿，保持同业委员会而不必建立办事机构，遇有问题，由同业委员会来会商解决。如果有涉及全行业的重大问题，则可召集行业全体会议或代表会议。同业公会下可按业务相近，或按地区组织小组；区的行业小组，受同业公会及区工商联或区分会双重领导。在有区一级组织的大中城市，同业公会主要应是在经济方面的活动，如组织各种加工订货，执行产销计划，评议税负，同业议价等。中小工商业者的一切政治性的活动，应该由区工商联或区分会来领导。他们在执行同业公会或同业委员会关于经济方面的决定发生争执时，也可以由区工商联或区分会来协助解决。
    工商业户数不多的小城市可以在工商业联合会下设立同业委员会及同业小组。工商界一切政治的经济的活动，除全市（县）性和通业性的应由工商联直接推行外，都可以通过同业委员会来推行。同业小组是辅助同业委员会推行工作的组织，不是一级组织，不可能起独立的作用。
    第四是手工业者，行商和摊贩的组织。在大城市和中等城市，手工业者（除已参加同业公会或同业委员会者外）行商和摊贩一般地可不必建立全市性的联合组织，而分别组织到区工商联或区分会之下。在一区之内如果手工业者，行商或摊贩户数很多，也可以建立手工业者，行商或摊贩的联合会（摊贩也可以按市场建立联合会），并得按行业或按地区分编小组。若干城市的手工业者、行商或摊贩已经建立全市性的联合会的，可以维持现状，如无存在必要，在他们自愿结束时即行结束。为着照顾这些小工商业者的利益，在大中城市的工商业联合会内，也可以吸收若干手工业者，行商及摊贩的代表，组织各种专门委员会，来研究和指导他们的生产、经营问题。小城市可以把手工业者、行商和摊贩分别组织到各同业委员会及同业小组中去，也可以让他们建立自己的同业委员会或同业小组。
    以上这些规定，目的在使工商业联合会真正成为服从共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令，并代表各类工商业者利益的人民团体；在使参加工商业联合会的大中小行业和大中小企业均能各得其所（省和全国性的组织且应照顾到大中小城市）；在加强工商业联合会的统一性，并明确其内部的分工。这是我们在起草工商业联合会组织通则时考虑到的几个比较重要的问题，此外条文多系参考各地现行办法规定，没有什么重要变更，所以不再作说明。
