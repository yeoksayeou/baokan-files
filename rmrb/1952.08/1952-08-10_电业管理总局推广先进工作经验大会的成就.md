The recently concluded conference on popularizing advanced work experience, convened by the State Electricity Administration of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, indicates that a large-scale movement to promote advanced experience is about to unfold throughout the national electricity system.

Over the past two or three years, thanks to the continuous improvement of the political consciousness and technical level of electricity workers across the country, the enthusiastic study of advanced Soviet experience, and the concrete assistance of Soviet experts, a large number of advanced experiences have emerged in various local electricity departments. As many as sixty-five different types were demonstrated and introduced at this conference alone. Many of these are key and systematic advanced experiences in improving the entire electricity production process. These include burning low-value coal (formerly called inferior coal), rapid overhaul, and scientific routine inspection methods in power generation, and adjusting power load in power supply. These experiences have been effective in some electricity departments and are the biggest secrets to increasing production, practicing economy, and reforming production in the electricity sector.

Burning low-value coal is not only a more effective way to reduce costs than simply lowering the coal consumption rate, but it also saves a large amount of good coal for use in the undertakings that need it most. Many power plants in Northeast China have already switched entirely to generating electricity with low-value coal. In Guannei (inside the passes), the Shijingshan Power Plant has also achieved success in mixing low-value coal, saving 80 percent of good coal from its total fuel consumption. In the early days of liberation, fuel costs at this plant accounted for 50 percent of the cost of power generation. After efforts to reduce the coal consumption rate, it was lowered to 38 percent. After burning a large amount of low-value coal, it has been reduced to 27 percent, making the cost of power generation 43 percent lower than the national standard.

The rapid overhaul method is also an advanced Soviet experience, an advanced experience for increasing the effective power supply time of power equipment. The Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant took only one-third of the nationally prescribed standard time to overhaul No. 1 boiler unit in July, including one day for operational testing. In terms of additional power generation alone, this is worth 2.8 billion yuan.

The scientific routine inspection method is a scientific management method for operations in the electricity system. It embodies scientific theory, operating procedures, accident handling procedures, and the responsibility system in charts and diagrams, making these procedures and systems easy for workers to grasp and thus easy to implement. The scientific routine inspection method requires planned, purposeful, and focused inspections, avoiding the phenomenon of workers becoming overly fatigued when practicing "three diligences" and "five diligences". By inspecting according to this method, the inspection time only takes up one-third, and the remaining two-thirds can be used to consider the problems of machine operation, thus making it easier to achieve safe and economical operation. The scientific routine inspection method uses instruments, meters, alarms, signals, etc. to replace simple empirical estimates, and judgments are made according to charts, so it is also a scientific management method combined with the training and education of workers. Practice has proven the superiority of this inspection method. The routine inspection method for the steam turbine workshop created by the Tong Huizeng group of Shijingshan over the past two years can achieve the goals of safe and economical operation and avoid the shortcomings of excessive worker fatigue. This method has been promoted in various departments of the Shijingshan Power Plant. The scientific routine inspection method is based on the advanced experience of the Shijingshan Power Plant and the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant, which has been summarized and improved.

Adjusting the power load is a key issue in the power supply system, an effective way to improve equipment utilization, and the foundation for supplying sufficient and inexpensive power. Taiyuan City's electricity has been adjusted twice, once in December last year and again in June this year, with great success. By reducing peak loads and increasing late-night loads, the Taiyuan Electricity Bureau has been able to supply electricity to some new power users and users who have increased their power consumption, which is equivalent to saving the state approximately 7 billion yuan in equipment investment.

In addition, the advanced experience of using a simple reverse balance method to calculate boiler thermal efficiency enables workers to take on the complex and heavy work that was previously performed by engineers and technicians. The method of treating boiler water with continuous surface blowdown and the addition of trisodium phosphate solves the water quality problem that was previously considered to be closely related to generator operation.

Although the superiority and importance of advanced experience is very obvious, it has been hindered by all kinds of conservative ideas during the promotion process. Some people even openly opposed it. Some administrative and technical cadres at the Shijingshan Power Plant believe that low-value coal is stone, which cannot be ground, cannot be burned, is not easy to ignite, and is easy to extinguish, and that burning low-value coal is not as good as burning furnace ash. Some people emphasize the difficulties, saying that low-value coal has a lot of ash and is prone to caking in the furnace, so equipment must be modified; for rapid overhaul, they emphasize that equipment conditions and technical conditions are not sufficient to implement it. Some people hold a passive or complacent attitude, thinking that promoting advanced experience is troublesome, and that it is okay to have no advanced experience and still achieve good results. When the Tangshan Power Plant carried out rapid overhaul, the overhaul schedule was the most important work and had to be done by technical personnel. However, the technical personnel of the Tangshan Power Plant were initially afraid of trouble and only recorded it in writing without drawing detailed tables. They did not draw them until they were urged again by their superiors. They adopted the attitude of "promote if you are told to promote, and don't promote if you are not told to promote," and were indifferent to the success or failure of the promotion of advanced experience.

Although the vast majority of electricity backbones from all over the country who came to Beijing to participate in the conference on popularizing advanced work experience had a welcoming attitude towards advanced experience, some cadres expressed doubts about advanced Soviet experience and distrust of the advanced experience created by the workers. They expressed doubts about the fact that the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant's major overhaul took only four days. Starting from the old way of thinking, they raised many technical questions: Is the boiler cooling time included in the overhaul time? If the cooling time is included, plus the oven baking time, the actual overhaul time will be very short; how long after the turbine is shut down should the large cover be opened, and what work should be done before opening the large cover; should measurements be taken after the overhaul? In order to solve similar technical questions and conservative ideas that may be encountered in the future promotion of advanced experience, the conference on popularizing advanced work experience answered these technical questions in as much detail as possible in group discussions and individual conversations. In order to explain the overhaul items and overhaul schedule of the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant, they specifically went to Tianjin to retrieve the overhaul schedule. The explanation of the technical problems greatly increased the confidence and determination of administrative cadres and engineering technicians to promote advanced experience.

At the same time, the conference used the examples of advanced factories to illustrate that the key to promoting advanced experience lies in the determination of leading cadres and relying on the masses of workers. For example, after the Shijingshan Power Plant burned low-value coal, the task of supplying pulverized coal greatly increased, and all the coal mills were working. There was no spare coal mill. If this situation continued for a long time, it would make it impossible to burn low-value coal. But this situation finally changed. The production capacity of each coal mill increased from 5.7 tons of coal per hour to 15 tons of coal per hour. This improvement was the result of changing the ratio of large and small steel balls in the coal mill (large balls crush coal blocks, and small balls grind the crushed coal into fine powder) based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, improving the hot air temperature to make the coal easier to crush and grind, and strengthening the connection between the miller and relevant departments, etc., based on the valuable experience of veteran workers when grinding low-value coal (high ignition point, high ash content). For example, when the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant began to formulate a rapid overhaul plan, middle-level cadres had three conservative ideas: How fast can the rapid overhaul be? Can the quality be guaranteed if it is fast? What to do if there are not enough people? The leading cadres of the plant took the overhaul schedule to the group, and cadres at all levels participated in the group discussion. As a result, the plan of the plant department was compressed from seven days to five days. The group drew up an overhaul schedule, which solved the technical personnel's ideological problem of "how fast can it be?" The Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant also solved the problem of "Can rapid overhaul guarantee quality?" by handing over the overhaul quality standards to the workers. They also strengthened the technical study of skilled workers and apprentices. They practiced in advance what could be practiced in advance, and learned according to the schedule what could not be practiced. In this way, the personnel problem of "few skilled workers and many apprentices" was solved.

    电业管理总局推广先进工作经验大会的成就
    新华社记者  王华东
    最近由中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局召开的推广先进工作经验大会表明：一个大规模地推广先进经验的运动即将在全国电业系统中展开。
    两、三年来，由于全国电业职工政治觉悟和技术水平不断提高，热烈学习苏联先进经验以及苏联专家的具体帮助，各地电业部门已出现了大量的先进经验，仅这次大会上表演、介绍的，就有大小六十五种之多。其中不少是在改进整个电业生产方面带关键性的、系统的先进经验。如发电方面的燃烧低值煤（原来叫劣煤）、快速检修、科学巡回检查法，供电方面的调整电力负荷等。这些经验在某些电业部门已经行之有效，是电业部门增产节约改革生产工作最大的窍门。
    烧低值煤不仅是比单纯降低燃煤率更为有效的降低成本的办法，而且可节省大量好煤，用到最需要好煤的事业上去。东北许多发电厂已全部用低值煤发电。在关内，石景山发电厂混烧低值煤，也已获得成功，节省好煤占全部燃料的百分之八十。在解放初期，该厂燃料成本占发电成本的百分之五十，经过努力降低燃煤率后，降低到百分之三十八；大量燃烧低值煤后，已降低到百分之二十七，使发电成本比国家规定标准降低了百分之四十三。
    快速检修法也是苏联的先进经验，是增加电力设备有效供电时间的一种先进经验。天津第一发电厂七月大修一号机炉，检修时间包括运转试验一天在内，只占国家规定标准的三分之一。这样，仅就多发电量来说，即值二十八亿元。
    科学巡回检查法是电业系统运行方面的科学管理方法。它把科学理论、操作规程、事故处理规程和负责制都用图表具体化了，使这些规程和制度成为容易为工人所掌握的东西，因此也就易于贯彻。科学巡回检查法要求有计划、有目的、有重点地进行检查，避免了实行“三勤”“五勤”时工人过于疲劳的现象。按这一方法进行检查，检查时间只占三分之一，余下的三分之二时间，便可用来考虑机器运转的问题，因此更容易达到安全运转和经济运转的目的。科学巡回检查法是用仪器、表计、警报、信号等代替了单纯的经验估计，按图表进行判断，因此又是一个和培养教育工人相结合的科学管理方法。这种检查法经过实践，已证明了它的优越性。二年来石景山佟惠增小组所创造的汽机车间的巡回检查法，既能达到安全、经济运转的目的，又能避免工人过度疲劳的缺点。这一方法在石景山发电厂各部门中得到推广。科学巡回检查法便是根据石景山发电厂和天津第一发电厂的先进经验加以总结和提高而来的。
    调整电力负荷是供电系统的关键问题，是提高设备利用率的有效办法，是供应足够的、廉价电源的基础。太原市的电力在去年十二月和今年六月先后进行了二次调整，收到了巨大的成绩。由于压低了高峰负荷，提高了深夜负荷，太原电业局已另外供应了一些新增电力用户和增加电力的电力用户的用电，等于给国家节省了约七十亿元的设备投资。
    此外，如用简易的反平衡法求锅炉热效率的先进经验，使过去由工程师、技术人员担任复杂繁重的工作，可以由工人来担负。用表面连续排污和加磷酸三钠的办法处理炉水，解决了过去一向认为和发电机运转关系很大的水质问题。
    先进经验的优越性和重要性虽已十分明显，但是在推广过程中还曾经受到各式各样的保守思想的阻碍。有些人甚至公开反对。石景山发电厂部分行政、技术干部，认为低值煤是石头，不能磨，不能烧，不易发火，却容易熄灭，烧低值煤不如烧炉灰。有些人强调困难，说低值煤灰分多，容易在炉膛里结瘤，非改造设备不可；对快速检修，强调设备条件、技术条件不够不能实行。有些人抱消极或自满态度，认为推广先进经验是找麻烦，认为没有先进经验成绩也不错呀。唐山发电厂进行快速检修，检修进度表是最重要的工作，要由技术人员来做。可是唐山发电厂的技术人员，起初怕麻烦，只用文字记载了一下，不愿划精细的表格，在上级再次督促下才划出来。他们采取了“叫推广就推广，不推广就不推广”的态度，对先进经验推广的成败，漠不关心。
    这次到北京参加推广先进工作经验大会的各地电业骨干，虽然绝大部分对先进经验抱着欢迎的态度，但也有部分干部对苏联先进经验表示怀疑，对职工们创造的先进经验不信任。他们对天津第一发电厂大检修时间只有四天表示怀疑。他们从旧的一套出发，提出了许多技术方面的疑问：锅炉冷却时间是否计算在检修时间之内，冷却时间如果计算在内，加上烘炉的时间，真正检修的时间便很短了；汽机停机后多少时间揭大盖，揭大盖前做什么工作；检修后是不是要做测定。推广先进工作经验大会为了解决今后在推广先进经验中可能遇到的类似的技术疑问和保守思想，曾在小组讨论会上和个别谈话中尽量详细地解答了这些技术问题。为了说明天津第一发电厂的检修项目和检修进度，特地到天津去把检修进度表取来。由于对技术问题进行了解释，大大增加了行政干部和工程技术人员推广先进经验的信心和决心。
    同时大会用先进厂的事例来说明：推广先进经验的关键在于领导干部决心和依靠工人群众。如石景山发电厂燃烧低值煤之后，煤粉供应的任务大大增加，全部磨煤机都参加了工作，没有备用的磨煤机，这种情况如果长期继续下去，便会使燃烧低值煤成为不可能的事。但是这种情况终于改变了，每部磨煤机的生产能力由每小时磨五点七吨煤，提高到每小时磨十五吨煤。这一提高是根据苏联专家的建议，改变了磨煤机内大小钢球的比率（大球把煤块击碎，小球把碎煤磨细），是根据老工人的宝贵经验，在磨低值煤（着火点高，灰分多）的情况下，提高了热风温度，使煤容易击碎磨细，加强了司磨和有关部门的联系等一系列改革的结果。又如天津第一发电厂在开始制订快速检修计划时，中级干部存在着三种保守思想：快速检修能快到什么程度？快能不能保证质量？人员不够怎么办？该厂领导干部把检修进度表拿到小组去，各级干部也参加了小组的讨论，结果把厂部的计划由七天压缩到五天。小组订出了检修进度表，使工程技术人员“到底能快到什么程度”的思想问题解决了。天津第一发电厂又用检修质量标准交给工人的办法，“快速检修能不能保证质量”的问题，也同样解决了。他们又加强技工和徒工的技术学习，能事先演习的便事先演习，不能演习的便按进度表进行学习。这样，便解决了“技工少、徒工多”的人员问题。
