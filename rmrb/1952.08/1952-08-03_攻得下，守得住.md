　　Can Attack and Can Defend
　　By Gong Jiemin and Yang Yang, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

After the enemy's "Autumn Offensive" was completely crushed by us last fall, for several months, the enemy no longer had the strength to launch large-scale offensives. However, the enemy was still not reconciled, and they frequently sent small units to harass us. But this kind of harassment did not benefit them. Every time they paid the price of many casualties, and in the end, they retreated in defeat. The soldiers of our army who were firmly guarding the front-line positions were constantly looking for opportunities to annihilate the enemy with flexible tactics. The battle of the eighth company of a certain unit to counterattack Height 662 is a brilliant example. With two platoons of troops, they captured this height in one fell swoop, completely annihilating more than 100 enemies who stubbornly resisted by relying on the terrain, and capturing 23 prisoners alive. In the five days that followed, the enemy launched continuous attacks, trying to recapture this height, but each time they were completely defeated. The enemy suffered more than 1,000 casualties in total, but they did not advance an inch. The warriors who captured and defended this height and won more with less were commended by the leaders of our army.

Height 662 is located in the east of the North Han River. The enemy regarded it as important as a "lifeline" and it was an outpost for their attacks on our army. This spring, the enemy painstakingly built fortifications on this height, turning it into a key position. There were clusters of bunkers on the height, connecting communication trenches, and more than a dozen semi-tunnel shelters. The area around the position was covered with landmines, and there were four rows of deer antlers and circular barbed wire. Defending here were three platoons of the 3rd Division Search Team of the Li pseudo-army and a firearms platoon of the 3rd Battalion of the 23rd Regiment. On the flanks and to the rear of the height were other pseudo-army companies, forming a deep deployment. The enemy artillery groups and tank guns in the vicinity of Longhudong and Yuyunli could also directly support this place. The enemy frequently launched attacks on our positions from here with small units. Our army commanders regarded this height as a nail that the enemy had driven into our front-line positions. In order to remove this nail, from the regimental and battalion leaders to the company combat teams, repeated reconnaissance was carried out before the battle, until every soldier was familiar with the terrain, understood the heart of the enemy's fortifications, and understood the enemy's troop deployments, firepower positions, and firepower control zones. Commanders at all levels also carefully studied the weaknesses of the enemy's defensive area and decided where to attack from. At the same time, before the counterattack, a combat plan was made on how to firmly defend the height after the victory of the attack and defeat the enemy's counterattacks.

On the night the battle began, the counterattack troops climbed towards the height under cover of darkness, felt their way to the front, and waited in hiding for the signal to attack. Our powerful artillery inflicted devastating casualties and psychological suppression on the enemy, and the assault group launched a fierce attack like a sharp knife. Because of the meticulous reconnaissance beforehand, a group from the 4th Squad of the 2nd Platoon smoothly felt their way in from the gate of the enemy's barbed wire, and the enemy had not yet noticed when they were only a few dozen meters away from them. Some enemies were blocked in the caves and became prisoners without firing a single shot. Other groups detoured to the enemy's flanks, cutting off the enemy's retreat. The main force charged fiercely from the left, beginning to divide and encircle the enemy. In ten minutes, they rushed to the main peak, destroying the enemy's command headquarters (company headquarters). After completely annihilating the enemy here, our army took advantage of the victory to attack the two unnamed heights in front. In the battle, the brave men of the assault team displayed an extremely tenacious combat spirit, charging upwards fiercely. New recruit Pan Shilu strived to be the first to climb the mountain, inserted himself into the enemy's ranks single-handedly, and killed fifteen enemies in one breath. When soldier Wang Deke was searching the enemy's shelters, the enemy stubbornly refused to surrender, so he cleverly threw in a grenade, killing seven enemies. He was wounded in the leg, but he did not leave the front line. Our army's artillery coordinated with the charging soldiers, accurately bombarding, causing the enemy's firepower deployment system to quickly disintegrate. The enemy's attempts to block our assault troops' advance with artillery fire were unsuccessful. The soldiers said while celebrating the victory of the counterattack: "Our artillerymen stopped the enemy's artillery from speaking, and we should really commend our artillery brothers."

After capturing this height and repelling the enemy's counterattacks, the soldiers reinforced the fortifications until they were as strong as copper walls and iron ramparts. They wrote a couplet on both sides of the fortifications: the first line is "Anger to death Truman"; the second line is "Worry to death Syngman Rhee". The horizontal inscription is "Indestructible". The soldiers said with full confidence in victory: "If we attack, we can capture it; if we defend, we can hold it. Under our positions is the enemy's graveyard."

    攻得下，守得住
    志愿军某部  宫洁民、杨杨
    去年秋天敌人的“秋季攻势”被我彻底粉碎以后，好几个月来，敌人再也没有力量发动大规模的攻势了。可是敌人还不服气，他们经常派出一些小的部队向我袭扰。但是，这种袭扰，并没有使他们得到便宜。他们每一次都付出许多人死伤的代价，最后还是败退了回去。固守在前沿阵地的我军的战士们，更不断地寻找机会，以机动灵活的战术歼灭敌人。某部八连反击六六二高地的战斗，就是其中一个光辉的范例。他们以两个排的兵力，一举攻占了这块高地，全部歼灭了据险顽抗的敌人一百多名，活捉了二十三个俘虏。在以后紧接着的五天中，敌人连续发动攻击，想夺回这块高地，但每一次都被彻底打败了。敌人前后一共死伤了一千多人，也没有前进一步。攻克与坚守这个高地、以少胜多的勇士们，受到了我军首长的嘉奖。
    六六二高地位于北汉江东部。敌人把它看作“生命线”一样重要，是他们向我军进攻的前哨阵地。今年春天，敌人费尽心机在这个高地上构筑工事，把它变为一个要点阵地。高地上地堡成群，交通沟互相连接，还有半坑道式的掩蔽部十余处。阵地周围遍地埋着地雷，并有鹿砦四道和环形的铁丝网。据守在这里的，有李伪军三师搜索队的三个排和二十三团三营的一个火器排。高地的侧后，还有另外的伪军连队，形成纵深配备。附近龙虎洞及鱼云里一带的敌炮群及坦克炮，也能直接支援这里。敌人经常从这儿以小部队向我阵地袭击。我军指挥员把这个高地看成是敌人楔入我前沿阵地的一个钉子。为了拔掉这个钉子，从团营首长到连的战斗小组，都在战前进行了反复的侦察，一直到每个战士都熟悉了地形，弄清了敌人工事的腹心地带，了解了敌人的兵力部署、火器位置和火力控制地带。各级指挥员还仔细研究了敌人防御地区的弱点，决定从那里进攻。同时，在反击前就作出了进攻胜利后如何固守高地，打垮敌人反扑的战斗方案。
    战斗开始的那天晚上，反击部队趁黑夜向高地爬进，摸到前沿，隐蔽着等待进攻信号。我强大炮火给敌以歼灭性的杀伤及精神上的压制，突击组像一把尖刀似地猛攻。由于事先进行了细密的侦察，二排四班的一个小组顺利地从敌人阵地铁丝网的门口摸进去，一直到接敌数十公尺时，敌人尚未发觉。有的敌人被堵在洞内，一枪未发就当了俘虏。其他的小组迂回到敌人侧后，切断了敌人的后路。主力从左猛冲，开始分割围歼。十分钟便冲上了主峰，捣毁了敌人指挥机关（连部）。全歼这里的敌人后，我军复乘胜攻击，直扑前面两个无名高地。战斗中，突击队的勇士们发挥了无比顽强的作战精神，往上猛冲。新战士潘士禄争取了登山第一名，单枪插入敌阵，一气打死十五个敌人。战士王德科搜索敌人掩蔽部时，敌人顽不缴枪，他机敏地投进一个手雷，炸死了七个敌人。他的腿部受了伤，也不下火线。我军的炮火配合着冲锋的战士，准确地轰击，使敌人的火力配备系统很快解体。敌人以炮火阻击我突击部队前进的一切企图，都没有成功。战士们在庆祝反击胜利时说：“我们的炮手们停止了敌炮的发言权，真该给炮兵老大哥们请功。”
    夺下这个高地并打退了敌人的反扑之后，战士们把工事加修得像铜墙铁壁一般。他们在工事两边写上了一副对联，上联是“气死杜鲁门”；下联是“愁死李承晚”。横额是“坚不可摧”。战士们都满怀胜利信心地说：“攻就攻得下，守就守得住。我们阵地下边就是敌人的坟墓。”
