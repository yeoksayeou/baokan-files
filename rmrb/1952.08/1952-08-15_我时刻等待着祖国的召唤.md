    I am Constantly Waiting for the Motherland's Call

    Editor: I am a student who has been recuperating in school for nearly a year. During these days, I have experienced the care of the People's Government for us young students more and more deeply every day. Recently, after reading the notice published in the People's Daily regarding the adjustment of the People's Scholarship for students in national universities and secondary schools, and other news about the state's large-scale training of cadres, I felt very excited.

    In the old society, I failed the university entrance examination for three consecutive years. Later, I was fortunate enough to pass, but I was overwhelmed by the hardships of life. During my time out of school, I worked as a technical assistant in a hospital for two years, but all my savings were used up within four months of entering school. Later, I had to live by selling clothes and borrowing money. In such circumstances, I did not study well, and my health was also ruined. My experience is just an ordinary example of millions of young people in the old society.

    After liberation, we have the care and love of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. With the improvement of the country's economic situation, our lives have improved. Now we can not only study with peace of mind, but also recuperate with peace of mind. The tragic fate of the youth in the old society is gone forever. Facing the bright future, I must exercise, study hard, improve my ideological awareness, and constantly wait for the motherland's call. Huang Minghua

    我时刻等待着祖国的召唤
    编辑同志：我是一个在学校里养病将近一年的学生，在这些日子里，我一天比一天更深刻地体验到人民政府对我们青年学生的关怀。最近读了人民日报上公布的关于调整全国高等学校及中等学校学生人民助学金的通知，和其他关于国家大量培养干部的消息后，我感到非常的兴奋。
    在旧社会里，我曾接连地考了三年大学都考不上，后来侥幸考上了，又被困苦的生活压得透不过气来。在失学期间，我曾经在医院里当了两年的技术助理员，但是所有的积蓄，在我入学后四个月就用光了。后来只好靠卖衣物、借贷过日子。在这样的情况下，书没有念好，身体也弄坏了。像我这样的遭遇，只不过是旧社会千百万青年中的一个普通例子罢了。
    解放后，我们有了共产党和毛主席的关怀和爱护，随着国家经济情况的好转，我们的生活得到了改善。现在我们不但可以安心读书，而且可以安心养病，旧社会青年的悲惨命运永远一去不复返了。面对着美好的前途，我一定要锻炼身体，努力学习，提高思想觉悟，时刻等待着祖国的召唤。  黄明华
