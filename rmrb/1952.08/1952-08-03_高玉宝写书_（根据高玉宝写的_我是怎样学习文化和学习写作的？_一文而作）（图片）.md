    X. In my seventeenth year (1943), the enemy puppets' rule in Northeast China became even more cruel. My grandfather, mother, uncle, and a younger brother all died in Dalian.
    XI. My father and I could no longer live in Dalian, so we had to return to the countryside empty-handed.
    XII. Life became even harder, and I had to work as a laborer again. In the evenings, I took care of my father's illness and stole time to read books under the oil lamp (books borrowed from fellow workers). My father often scolded me for wasting lamp oil, so I covered the lamp with a piece of torn paper and secretly read.

    十、我十七岁那年（一九四三年），敌伪在东北的统治更残酷了。我爷爷、母亲、叔父和一个弟弟都死在大连了。
    十一、我们父子没法再住在大连了，只好两手空空回到乡下。
    十二、生活更苦了，只得再当劳工。我晚上照顾父亲的病，偷空在油灯下看书（从工友借来的书）。父亲常骂我浪费灯油，我就用一张破纸遮住灯光，偷偷地看。
