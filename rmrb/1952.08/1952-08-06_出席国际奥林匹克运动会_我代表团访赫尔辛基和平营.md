Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 4th: The Chinese delegation participating in the 15th International Olympic Games visited the Helsinki Peace Camp on the afternoon of the 2nd, expressing the Chinese delegation's ardent desire to promote peace and strengthen the international friendship of athletes from all countries to the youth of various countries in the camp.

This peace camp was organized by the Finnish Peace Committee and the Finnish Democratic Youth League, with the intention of promoting world peace and international friendship during the Olympic Games. At its peak, it gathered more than two thousand young people from various countries. When our delegation visited, there were still about three hundred people living here. When our delegation arrived, they welcomed us at the entrance of the camp with flowers in their hands, constantly cheering and paying their respects. The weather was sunny that day, and everyone happily held an informal gathering outdoors in the bright sunshine, mutually expressing their will to strive for peace. Warm cheers repeatedly rang out in the meeting place. At the meeting place, a red flag sent by Chinese youth to Finnish youth in 1950 was hung, with congratulatory messages from Chinese youth to Finnish youth, which became a symbol of the lasting friendship between the two peoples. At the gathering, youths from various countries sang the "World Democratic Youth March" together in their own languages. Our athletes, in groups of three or five, or individually, were surrounded by young people from various countries, who requested our representatives to sign autographs and take photos together. When our delegation left, they were deeply excited by such warm friendship.

    出席国际奥林匹克运动会
    我代表团访赫尔辛基和平营
    【新华社赫尔辛基四日电】参加第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的我国代表团二日下午访问赫尔辛基和平营，向营中的各国青年表达了中国代表团对促进和平和加强各国运动员的国际友谊的热切愿望。
    这个和平营是芬兰和平委员会和芬兰民主青年联合会组织的，用意在于在奥林匹克运动会期间促进世界和平和国际友谊。这里最热闹的时候曾聚集着各国的两千多个青年。当我国代表去访问时，这里还住着三百人左右。当我国代表团抵达时，他们都拿着鲜花在营门口欢迎，并且不断地欢呼致意。这一天天气晴朗，大家欢乐地在户外明朗的阳光下举行了不拘形式的集会，相互表示了争取和平的意志。会场中屡次响起热烈的欢呼。在集会地点，张挂着一面中国青年在一九五○年送给芬兰青年的红旗，上面有中国青年对芬兰青年的祝词，这成了两国人民持久友谊的象征。在集会上各国青年各以自己的言语一同唱起了世界民主青年进行曲。我国运动员三五成群地或个别地被各国青年所包围，他们纷纷要求我国代表签名留念和共同拍照。我国代表团离去时，都为这样热情的友谊深深地感到兴奋。
