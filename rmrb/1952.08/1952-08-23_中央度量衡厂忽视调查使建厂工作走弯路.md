    Central Metrology Factory's Neglect of Investigation Led to Detours in Construction
    Ji Chongwei, Director of the Design Department, Ministry of Light Industry, Central People's Government

    The capital construction work of the Central Metrology Factory, affiliated with the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government, began preparations in the second half of 1950. In January 1951, a factory construction plan was drafted, a site was selected, land was purchased, and contacts were made with domestic and foreign companies to order machinery. In April, the Yongmao Construction Company of Beijing was commissioned to design factory buildings and dormitories, and construction began in October. Now, the first phase of construction, including factory buildings, dormitories, and walls, is nearing completion. Half of the machines ordered domestically have been shipped to the site, and some of the machines ordered from abroad have also arrived. However, because the types and scale of the factory's products have not been finally determined, and the planning and design work have not been based on accurate survey data, the factory buildings already built and the machines purchased cannot be put into production in a timely manner, resulting in the backlog of over 10 billion yuan of state funds. The second phase of the project also cannot proceed, and a new survey and design are now required.

    The main reason for the errors in the capital construction work of the Central Metrology Factory is the lack of thorough investigation and research. The purpose of building the factory was to support the country's implementation of a unified metric system, to manufacture verification instruments, local standard instruments, and other industrial metrological instruments. However, what specific products would be produced? What specifications? And what would be the output? These questions were not thoroughly investigated and clarified during the factory construction. In the past year or more, the Ministry of Light Industry has convened many meetings to discuss these issues, and there have been many opinions from various parties, but none of them were based on accurate data, so no definite conclusions could be reached. Therefore, the factory still does not have a complete plan and design, and important issues such as the size of the factory, the construction of factory buildings, the arrangement of machinery and equipment, and the production process have not been determined. Under these circumstances, hastily building factory buildings and purchasing machines inevitably led to the backlog and waste of funds.

    Since the promulgation of the Interim Measures for Capital Construction Work by the Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government has reviewed the factory's capital construction work during the "Three-Anti" campaign. It was found that there were errors of principle in the work, such as being eager to achieve quick results and neglecting investigation and design, which violated the basic capital construction procedures. It was decided to "make up" the lessons in accordance with the procedures. Starting with investigation and research, a new design will be carried out after the product tasks are determined. Before the design work is completed, all new projects will be stopped to avoid greater waste. At the same time, an investigation team was sent to the Northeast, East China, and other places to investigate the production and sales of metrological instrument industry in order to determine the types, specifications, and scale of the factory's products based on actual needs. Now, the investigation work has been completed, and preparations for the design work are being actively carried out.

    中央度量衡厂忽视调查使建厂工作走弯路
    中央人民政府轻工业部设计处处长　季崇威
    中央人民政府轻工业部所属中央度量衡厂的基本建设工作，从一九五○年下半年即开始筹备。一九五一年一月间开始草拟建厂计划，选择厂址，购买土地，向国内外接洽订购机器。并于四月间委托北京市永茂建筑公司设计厂房、宿舍，十月份开始施工。现在第一期建筑的厂房、宿舍、围墙等工程，即将完成。在国内订购的机器已有半数运抵现场，在国外订购的机器也运到了一部分。但由于该厂的产品种类和规模没有最后确定，计划和设计工作都没有正确的调查资料作根据，所以现在已经建造的部分厂房和购买的机器不能及时地转入生产，积压国家资金一百余亿元，第二期工程也没法进行，现在还得重新调查和设计。
    造成中央度量衡厂基本建设工作的错误的主要原因，是没有作周密的调查研究的结果。建设该厂的目的，是为了配合国家推行统一的度量衡公制，制造检定用器、地方标准器及其他工业用的度量衡仪器。但是，具体生产哪几种产品呢？什么规格呢？产量又多大呢？在建厂时都没有深入调查清楚。过去一年多的时间内，中央轻工业部虽然召集过多次会议来讨论这些问题，各方的意见也不少，但也都没有正确的资料作根据，所以仍然得不出肯定的结论。因此，该厂到现在还没有一个完整的计划和设计，从而工厂规模的大小、厂房的建筑、机器设备的排列及生产程序等重要问题，都没有确定。在这种情况下，草率建筑厂房和购买机器，就必然造成资金的积压和浪费。
    自政务院颁布基本建设工作暂行办法以后，中央人民政府轻工业部在“三反”运动中检查了该厂的基本建设工作，认为在工作中存在着急于求成，忽视调查和设计的违反基本建设程序的原则性的错误，并决定按程序重新“补课”。先从调查研究入手，待产品任务确定后重新进行设计；在设计工作没有完成以前，停止进行一切新的工程，以免造成更大的浪费。同时并派出调查小组分赴东北、华东等地调查度量衡仪器工业的产销情况，以便根据实际的需要，确定该厂的产品种类、规格和规模。现在，调查工作已经完毕，正积极从事设计的准备工作中。
