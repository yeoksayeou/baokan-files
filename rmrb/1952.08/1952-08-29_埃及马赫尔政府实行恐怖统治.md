Xinhua News Agency, August 28th, Cairo Dispatch: Naguib, the head of the Egyptian military group that launched the military coup on the night of July 22nd, and Maher, the Egyptian Prime Minister who came to power with his support, are intensifying the implementation of a fascist reign of terror domestically with the support of American and British imperialism.

On August 13th, the Egyptian government dispatched a large number of military police to carry out a bloody suppression of striking workers at the Kafr el-Dawar textile factory near Alexandria, who were demanding a wage increase. As a result, six workers were shot and killed, and more than twenty were injured. According to a United Press International dispatch from Cairo on the 14th, the Maher government, after the bloody suppression, conducted a lightning-speed roundup, arresting a total of 567 workers and handing them over to a specially established five-member military tribunal for trial. This military tribunal has the final authority to handle the accused workers. On August 18th, this military tribunal sentenced one of the accused workers to death and has already issued secret verdicts on the first batch of twenty-nine workers on trial. Newspapers in Beirut pointed out that the Egyptian government's chief prosecutor had requested that twenty-eight of the twenty-nine workers be sentenced to death.

Following the bloody suppression of the striking workers, the Maher government searched the Wafd Party's newspaper, "Al Misri," on the 14th and arrested all of its personnel. On the 16th, Egyptian government police arrested another group of workers and students. On August 26th, the Egyptian military authorities announced that the content of all sermons given during prayers in mosques must be reviewed by the military in advance.

Despite the fact that the Maher government is intensifying its reign of terror with the support of American and British imperialism, Egyptian workers are still persisting in their struggle to improve their lives and fight for national independence. According to a Reuters dispatch from Cairo on the 17th, of the 10,500 workers at the Kafr el-Dawar textile factory, the vast majority, except for more than 3,000, are continuing to strike.

    埃及马赫尔政府实行恐怖统治
    【新华社二十八日讯】开罗消息：在七月二十二日晚发动军事政变的埃及军人集团首领纳吉布和在他的支持下上台的埃及首相马赫尔，在美英帝国主义的支持下，正在国内加紧实施法西斯恐怖统治。
    八月十三日，埃及政府派遣大批军警，对亚历山大港附近的卡夫尔·厄尔·达瓦尔纱厂要求增加工资的罢工工人进行血腥镇压，结果共枪杀工人六人，打伤二十余人。据合众社开罗十四日电透露，马赫尔政府在血腥镇压之后，又进行闪电式的围捕，共捕去五百六十七个工人，并把这些工人交给特别设立的五人军事法庭审讯，这个军事法庭具有处理被控工人的最后权力。八月十八日，这个军事法庭已把被控工人中的一个判处死刑，并已对第一批受审的二十九个工人提出秘密的判决。贝鲁特的报纸指出，埃及政府首席检察官曾要求把那二十九个工人中的二十八个判处死刑。
    继对罢工工人实行血腥镇压以后，马赫尔政府又在十四日搜查华夫脱党机关报“埃及人报”，逮捕了该报全体人员；十六日，埃及政府警察又逮捕了一批工人和学生。二十六日，埃及军事当局宣布，所有在回教堂中礼拜时讲道的内容，都要预先经过军方审查。
    尽管马赫尔政府在美英帝国主义支持下加紧实行恐怖镇压，但是埃及工人仍坚持为改善生活、争取民族独立而斗争。据路透社开罗十七日电透露：卡夫尔·厄尔·达瓦尔纱厂的一万零五百工人中，除三千多名外，绝大多数仍继续罢工。
