The conference was attended by 130 representatives from 58 organizations. The conference decided that Japan would send representatives to the International Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights and established a preparatory committee in Tokyo to launch a movement to defend youth rights.
    The Tokyo Preparatory Committee recently decided to convene the Japanese Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights on August 14th and 15th, and a large cultural festival will be held during the conference on August 15th. The preparatory committee has called on all Japanese youth, regardless of their ideology or religious beliefs, to unify their will and actions and unite to defend the rights and freedoms of Japanese youth. The preparatory committee is mobilizing youth in workshops, schools, and rural areas to discuss the holding of the Japanese Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights, and is calling on workers in small businesses, tenant farmers, and other unorganized youth and women to participate in the signature campaign against conscription.
