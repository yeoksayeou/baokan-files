    Engineer Zhang Youling Reviews His "Masterpiece" Ideology
    Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on August 16th published a letter from Comrade Lu Da, a worker at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, using the factory building of the plant's machine repair shop as a typical example to criticize my "masterpiece" ideology. His opinions broadly represent the opinions of the worker masses towards me and are completely correct. Before the "Three-Anti" Movement, the Central Finance and Economics Committee organized a basic construction inspection team to come to Taiyuan for an inspection, but at that time I did not have enough understanding of my mistakes. It was not until after the launch of the great "Three-Anti" Movement, especially when drawing a clear line with bourgeois ideology, that I realized the seriousness of my mistakes.
    In 1950 and 1951, the projects I designed in Taiyuan were all within the scope of heavy industry. Before liberation, the construction of China's general heavy industry relied on foreign designs, and domestic engineers at most only had the position of assistants, so naturally there was no talk of work experience. In the past, although I had designed some light industrial factory buildings, the design standards were generally based on drafts from certain British and American imperialist machinery companies, everywhere considering the promotion of products by imperialist countries and the profits of capitalists. Even at that time, they could not take into account China's actual situation; in today's new democratic New China, of course, they are even more unrealistic. When I first arrived in Taiyuan in the autumn of 1949, seeing the grand scale of future construction, I thought my chance to show my skills had come, and I could do a "career" worthy of myself, others, and the country. In fact, these two fine-sounding words, "career," represented many bourgeois and petty-bourgeois consciousnesses, status, reputation, money, aloofness, experts...almost my entire "philosophy of life"; and although I also cared a little about loving the motherland and workers' welfare, they were far behind. In the two years I worked in Taiyuan, I thought I had worked hard and contributed greatly, but I didn't realize that I was completely "going my own way" with old ideas and spoiled the important task that the people had entrusted to me. What a painful thing this is! I should thank Comrade Lu Da for his criticism of me. I also saw in the People's Pictorial in July 1952 a photo of most of the windows of this machine repair shop building being painted with white powder, and I deeply felt that I had "overreached myself" and let the people down. I believe that this example not only makes me more deeply aware of my wrong ideas, but also allows general old technical personnel or senior intellectuals to use this as a reference to check whether they have "masterpiece" ideas or other bourgeois ideas that harm the people.
    The "Three-Anti" Movement educated me and gave me a considerable transformation
    (Thorough transformation still depends on my future efforts and the help of comrades). In the past four months, I have completed four or five engineering designs of various sizes, and to varying degrees, I am working towards the direction of increasing production and practicing economy. In terms of steel, I have saved 158 tons for the country, which is worth more than 1.1 billion yuan in Renminbi at a value of 7.38 million yuan per ton. If this number is said to be a saving, it is only equal to one-third of what I wasted in my work in Taiyuan; further analysis, it is not so much a saving as a reduction in waste. In other words, without the education of the "Three-Anti" Movement, I would have spent more than 1.1 billion yuan in the above designs. This shows that waste can be created carelessly and easily, while savings must be achieved with painstaking effort and careful calculation. The size of the savings is secondary, and the main thing is its spirit, just like every bricklayer can break one less brick every day, and the wealth saved across the country is incalculable. We engineering and technical personnel must recognize this point.
    In the future, I must often use the method of criticism and self-criticism to review the errors and shortcomings in my work and correct them in a timely manner. I will work hard to transform myself in order to become an engineer who serves the people and benefits the workers. I hope that comrades who care about me will continue to guide me in this regard.　Zhang Youling

专栏：对人民日报读者  批评建议的反应

    张有龄工程师检讨“杰作”思想
    编辑同志：八月十六日人民日报“读者来信”栏，登载了太原钢铁厂工人鲁达同志的来信，以该厂机修厂厂房作典型例子，批判了我的“杰作”思想。他的意见普遍地代表了工人群众对我的意见，是完全正确的。在“三反”运动以前，中央财政经济委员会曾组织基本建设检查团到太原来作过一次检查，但那时我对我的错误还没有足够的认识。一直到伟大的“三反”运动开展后，尤其在与资产阶级思想划清界限时，我才认清了自己错误的严重性。
    一九五○年、一九五一年两年中，我在太原设计的工程都属于重工业范围。解放前我国一般重工业的建设都是依赖外国人设计，国内的工程师们顶多只有助理的地位，自然谈不到工作经验。过去我虽设计过一些轻工业厂房，但设计标准一般是根据某些英美帝国主义机器公司所出的草图，处处为着帝国主义国家推销产品和资本家的利润打算，就是在当时也不能照顾到我国的实际情况；在今天新民主主义的新中国，当然就更不切实际了。当我在一九四九年秋初到太原时，看到将来建设规模的宏巨，以为自己一显身手的机会到了，可以做一番对己对人对国家都无愧的“事业”。其实，“事业”这两个好听的字却代表了许许多多资产阶级和小资产阶级的意识，地位、名誉、金钱、清高、专家……几乎是我整个的“人生哲学”；而关于爱护祖国、工人福利虽然也曾挂怀一二，却远远瞠乎其后。在太原工作两年中，自以为劳苦功高，不晓得自己完全是怀着旧思想“独行其是”，而把人民交给我的重大任务做坏了。这是何等痛心的事！鲁达同志对我提出批评，我应该向他致谢。我在人民画报一九五二年七月号上也看见这座机修厂房大部窗的玻璃都涂了白粉的照片，深深感到自己“弄巧成拙”，对不起人民。我认为，这个事例，不但使我更深刻地认识自己的错误思想，一般旧技术人员或高级知识分子，也可以此为借镜，检查一下自己有无“杰作”思想或其他为害人民的资产阶级思想。
    “三反”运动教育了我，使我得到了相当的改造
    （彻底的改造还有赖于今后自己的努力和同志们的帮助）。最近四个月我完成了大小四五项工程设计，在不同程度上正向着增产节约的方向努力。在钢材上，已替国家省下了一百五十八吨，若以每吨七百三十八万元计值，合人民币十一亿多万元。如果把这一个数目说成是节约，它不过等于我在太原工作中所浪费的三分之一；进一步分析，与其说是节约，不如说是少浪费了。换一句话说，如果没有“三反”运动的教育，我在以上这几项设计中，必然要多化十一亿多万元。这可以说明：浪费是漫不经心、轻而易举就可造成的，而节约则必须煞费苦心、精打细算才能作到。节约数目的大小是其次，主要在于它的精神，正如每一个泥瓦工每日能少打碎一块砖，全国节约的财富就不可计算。我们工程技术人员必须认识这一点。
    今后，我一定要经常用批评与自我批评的方法，检讨自己工作中的错误和缺点，并及时加以纠正。我要努力改造自己，以期做到一个为人民服务、为工人造福的工程师。希望爱护我的同志们不断地在这方面指导我。　张有龄
