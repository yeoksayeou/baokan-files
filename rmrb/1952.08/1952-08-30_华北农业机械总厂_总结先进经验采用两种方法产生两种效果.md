North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
Summarizes Advanced Experiences Using Two Methods, Producing Two Effects

How should advanced production experiences be summarized? The Beijing North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory adopted two different methods, producing two different effects.

Jiao Xinglin's work method in the factory's foundry workshop is a sand casting operation method created by concentrating everyone's strengths. If this experience is promoted, it can not only increase production but also reduce the scrap rate. However, because the summary adopted a top-down method without mass approval, it encountered great resistance in promotion.

In early June, the leadership discovered that Jiao Xinglin's output often exceeded the task by 22 percent, and the scrap rate was only 3 percent (compared to the general 12 percent). Therefore, the Party, the Trade Union, the Youth League, and the administrative leadership sent people to talk to Jiao Xinglin to summarize his advanced experience. Without group discussion, a meeting was convened of workshop activists and Jiao Xinglin's Wang Fushou plowshare group (out of the group of eighteen, only five attended). It was formally announced that Jiao Xinglin's work method was an advanced work method. Although some young workers spoke on the spot to express their support, they did not know the detailed content of this work method. Because the workers and masses did not have a full discussion, the advanced work method was difficult to be accepted by the masses. If the leadership insisted on promoting it, the workers had nothing to say, but in reality, they were paying lip service. Some workers said, "I've done this before! There's nothing to it!" Other workers said: "Master Jiao is young and strong." "The leadership favors Jiao Xinglin!" Therefore, although it was promoted with great fanfare and a promotion meeting was held, the effect was not significant. The young worker Ma Shilin said: "Master Jiao's experience has been promoted, but it hasn't been spread widely!"

Later, when the factory summarized the advanced experience of Zhang Jingtong in the carpentry workshop, it adopted the mass line method of bottom-up, so the promotion was rapid and the results were remarkable. Ordinary workers made one hundred plow handles per day, while Zhang Jingtong made more than one hundred and forty. After the factory leadership discovered this, they sent technicians to study his work experience, and initially summarized four major characteristics: good preparation, appropriate tool placement, accurate axe strikes, and quick discernment of grain direction. The leadership then convened production group meetings and workshop skill exchange meetings to mobilize everyone to discuss and see whose skills were better. Because of the process of brewing and comparison, Zhang Jingtong's advanced work method was quickly recognized by everyone.

At the group and workshop skill exchange meetings, the staff and workers spoke enthusiastically, and many people put forward valuable opinions. Inspector Li Shutang said: "Master Zhang has always had high output and good quality, and we must all learn his skills." Du Quanzhi said: "Master Zhang's No. 2 plane is too big. If we switch to a No. 3 plane, the work will be easier and faster." These opinions further supplemented and developed Zhang Jingtong's working methods. After the skill exchange meeting, the factory leadership organized a promotion and demonstration meeting of Zhang Jingtong's work method. Since then, a high tide of learning Zhang Jingtong's work method has been set off throughout the carpentry workshop. So far, those who have learned Zhang Jingtong's work method account for 86 percent of the total number of people in the entire workshop. The average output has increased from more than one hundred plow handles per person per day to about two hundred and thirty. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 华北农业机械总厂  总结先进经验采用两种方法产生两种效果

    华北农业机械总厂
    总结先进经验采用两种方法产生两种效果
    先进生产经验怎么总结呢？北京华北农业机械总厂采用了两种不同的方法，产生了两种不同的效果。
    这个厂铸工车间的焦兴林工作法，是集中大家优点而产生的一种翻砂操作方法，如果推广这一经验不但能够提高产量，而且可以降低报废率。但由于总结中采取了由上而下的未经群众公认的方法，因而在推广中遭受到很大的阻力。
    六月初，领导上发现焦兴林的产量经常超任务百分之二十二，报废率只有百分之三（一般的百分之十二）。于是党、工会、青年团和行政领导上，便派人下去找焦兴林谈话，总结他的先进经验。没经过小组酝酿就召开车间积极分子及焦兴林所在的王福寿犁尖组会议（全组十八人，那次只有五个人到会），正式宣布焦兴林工作法是先进的工作法，当场虽然有些青年工人发言表示拥护，但是他们并不知道这个工作法的详细内容是什么。因为没有经过工人群众充分的讨论，先进的工作方法是很难被群众接受的。领导方面如果硬要推广，工人也没有什么好说，但是实际上是口服心不服的。有的工人说：“以前我这样干过呀！没有什么！”又有的工人说：
    “焦师傅年壮有力气。”“领导上偏爱焦兴林！”因此，虽然大张旗鼓地宣传了，还开过推广大会，可是效果并不大。青年工人马士林说：“焦师傅的经验推是推了，就是没有广！”
    该厂在后来总结木工车间张景通先进经验时，采取了自下而上的群众路线的方法，因而推广迅速，成绩显著。一般工人每天做犁把一百根，张景通每天做一百四十多根。工厂领导方面发现后，便派技术人员去研究他的工作经验，初步总结出四大特点，即准备工作做得好、工具放得适当、斧子下得不落空、刮大面顺丝直丝辨别快。领导方面随即召开生产小组会和车间窍门座谈会，发动大家讨论，看谁的窍门好。因为经过了酝酿比较的过程，张景通先进的工作法，很快便被大家公认了。
    在小组和车间的窍门座谈会上，职工群众热烈地发言，有不少人还提出了很有价值的意见。检验员李树棠说：“张师傅向来是产量高，质量好，咱大伙一定要学习他的窍门。”杜全芝说：“张师傅用的二号刨嫌大，如果改用三号刨，工作上更省劲、更轻快。”这些意见，又进一步补充和发展了张景通的工作方法。开罢了窍门座谈会之后，工厂领导方面又组织了张景通工作法的推广和表演大会，自此，整个木工车间便掀起了学习张景通工作法的高潮。到目前为止，学会张景通工作法的已占全车间总人数的百分之八十六。平均产量已由每天每人生产犁把一百多根提高到二百三十根左右。　（新华社）
