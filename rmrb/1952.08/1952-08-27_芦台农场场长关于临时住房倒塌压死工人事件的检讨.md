　　芦台 Farm Director's Self-Criticism Regarding the Collapse of Temporary Housing and the Death of Workers
　　We sincerely accept the criticism from Comrade Dai Guoen, Chairman of the Ninghe County Federation of Trade Unions in Hebei Province, published in the People's Daily on August 2nd, regarding the collapse of our farm's temporary dormitory, which resulted in the death and injury of workers, as well as the criticism and instructions from the State Farms Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture regarding this incident.
　　Our thinking on "relying on workers to run the farm well" was not clear enough, and we had serious bureaucratic tendencies in our leadership style, neglecting the safety and welfare of the workers. This is the root cause of this incident. Before the incident, although we knew that the temporary dormitory was not strong enough, we did not conduct an in-depth inspection. Therefore, we did not discover the basic shortcomings of the house, and of course, it was impossible to take effective measures to prevent the incident. I am primarily responsible for this incident. Three days after the incident, the farm's Party general branch began a profound self-criticism within the Party and has reported its opinions on Party disciplinary actions to the higher-level Party committee. On the administrative side, a meeting of all cadres was convened, and I made a self-criticism at the meeting, calling on all cadres to examine and reflect on their work and thoughts through this incident and to propose opinions on the punishment of those responsible for the incident.
　　This house was built last summer for temporary short-term workers who came to the farm to weed, and it was not intended as a permanent dormitory for the workers. The house was indeed simple. When it was built, the pillars were buried shallowly, and the terrain was low-lying, making it easy to flood during heavy rains, so the foundation was very unstable. This year, the farm's production tasks increased, and the number of personnel increased from more than 500 to more than 1,500, so there was not enough housing. Because the new dormitory had not yet been completed, the house was repaired for temporary use. On July 4th, I went to inspect it once, and the comrades said that it was too crowded. I felt that the house was still habitable, and since the new house was only ten days or so away from completion, the workers could move soon, so I replied, "We will move into the new house in a few days." This shows that my inspection work was not thorough enough, and I was negligent, which prevented me from preventing this serious accident. In addition to having reported the details of the incident and the proposed punishment for the responsible personnel to the higher authorities for approval, we also make the above self-criticism.

### 芦台农场场长关于临时住房倒塌压死工人事件的检讨

    芦台农场场长关于临时住房倒塌压死工人事件的检讨
    八月二日人民日报登载的河北省宁河县总工会主席戴国恩同志对我场临时宿舍倒塌，压死压伤工人事件的批评，和中央农业部国营农场管理局关于这一事件对我们的批评和指示，我们是诚恳接受的。
    我们“依靠工人办好农场”的思想不够明确，在领导作风上有严重的官僚主义，不关心工人的安全和福利问题，这是这次事件发生的根本原因。在这次事件发生前，我们虽然知道临时宿舍房子不够坚固，但没有深入检查，因此没有发现房子的基本缺点，当然就不可能采取有效措施，防止这次事件的发生。这次事件首先要由我来负责。事件发生后第三天，农场的党的总支就开始在党内进行深刻检讨，并已将党内处分意见报告上级党委。行政方面也召开了全体干部会议，我在大会上作了检讨，并号召全体干部通过这次事件来检查和检讨自己的工作和思想，并提出对这次事件有关责任人员的处分意见。
    这所房子是去年夏季给来场拔草的临时短工搭盖的，并不是给工人同志们建筑的永久性宿舍。房子的确简陋。搭盖的时候，柱子埋的浅，地势又洼，下大雨时容易浸水，根基很不稳固。今年农场生产任务加大，人员由五百余人增至一千五百余人，房子不够住；又因新建宿舍尚未完成，所以把这座房子又加以修理临时住用。七月四日，我曾去检查过一次，同志们提出住的太挤；我觉得屋子还可以住，而且距新房交工日期只有十来天，不久就可迁移，因此就答复说：“过几天就搬进新屋子去。”这说明我检查工作很不深入，麻痹大意，以致未能防止这一严重事故的发生。我们除已将事情的经过及有关责任人员应受处分报请上级批示外，并作如上检讨。芦台农场场长　李　直
