Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: China's six major people's organizations - the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation , the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, sent telegrams to the Japanese people from all walks of life on August 22nd, warmly welcoming the Japanese people to send representatives to Beijing to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and unanimously hoped that the Japanese representatives could visit various parts of China after the meeting to enhance friendship and unity between the Chinese and Japanese people, so as to exert greater strength in the great struggle to defend Asian peace.

    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions said in a telegram to Japanese workers: "The peace and security of Asia has been severely threatened. The Korean armistice negotiations are still being delayed and obstructed. After launching a barbaric bacteriological warfare, the American aggressors recently bombed the Yalu River power plant in an attempt to expand the war. In Japan, after the unilateral 'peace treaty with Japan' came into effect, the 'Subversive Activities Prevention Act' was recently passed, further depriving the Japanese people of their democratic rights and accelerating Japan's militarization, making the people in the Asian and Pacific regions who suffered from Japanese imperialism during the Second World War feel the new threat of war again. Japanese workers have shown unparalleled courage in the great struggle against foreign occupation, for national independence, against reactionary rule, for the people's democratic freedom, and for peace in Asia and the world. We are keenly concerned about your every struggle. We firmly believe that the united struggle of Japanese and Chinese workers will play an important role in stopping American imperialist aggression and saving Asian peace. Therefore, we warmly support the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and sincerely welcome Japanese workers to send representatives to participate in the conference. "
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions said in telegrams to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Industrial Unions Conference, the Japan Joint Wage Struggle Liaison Council, and the Japan Liaison Office of the World Federation of Trade Unions: "Since the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held in June this year, the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific regions has greatly developed. We believe that the participation of Japanese worker representatives in the conference will further increase the strength of defending peace."
    Cai Chang, chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, said in a telegram to Japanese women: "We are very excited to learn that prominent figures from all walks of life in Japan held a preparatory meeting in Osaka to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. We express our heartfelt respect to the Japanese women who love peace and are determined to actively struggle to save peace. We believe that you will overcome all difficulties and send your own representatives to attend the meeting."
    The All-China Democratic Youth Federation pointed out in a telegram to the Japan Youth Fatherland Front: The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will undoubtedly make a great contribution to strengthening the unity of the people of all countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts and to the struggle for peace. Therefore, it is extremely important for the Japan Youth Fatherland Front to widely mobilize peace-loving youth from all walks of life in Japan, regardless of political views or religious beliefs, to elect their own representatives to attend the conference and discuss peace issues that are closely related to the Japanese people and youth. The Chinese youth are determined to fully support the Japanese youth's struggle for peace and wish them victory.
    The All-China Students' Federation said in a telegram to the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation: "Chinese students have suffered from long-term imperialist aggression and oppression, know the preciousness of peace, and are determined to dedicate their strength to the cause of defending peace. We believe that Japanese youth and students who love peace and their motherland will also unite to strive for peace so that Japanese youth will no longer suffer the ravages of war. You can believe that Chinese students will definitely support you with all their strength. We are waiting for the representatives you send to attend the meeting and sincerely invite your representatives to visit various parts of China after the meeting and meet with the vast number of Chinese students."
    The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles said in a telegram to the Japanese cultural and literary and art circles: "Under the oppression of internal and external reactionaries, the Japanese people have shown the courage and determination to fight for peace, democracy, independence, and freedom. Japanese cultural figures, like the people of the whole country, are making extremely valuable efforts for this struggle. Now that the American imperialist war of aggression is seriously threatening peace in Asia and the world, the people of our two countries and all scientists, educators, writers, artists, scholars, and professors should unite more closely and fight to the end to defend peace and culture!"
    The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce said in a telegram to the Japanese business community: "Many people in the Japanese business community long for peace and oppose war, because the war-mongers' rearmament policy has shrunk Japan's industry and commerce, and the US embargo measures have caused the greatest obstacles to Japan's foreign trade. The people of both China and Japan eagerly hope that China and Japan will live in peace and develop normal trade relations between the two countries. The Sino-Japanese trade agreement signed in Beijing on June 1st expresses the wishes of the people of the two countries. We warmly welcome the arrival of your representatives and to visit various aspects of our country's construction work after the meeting to promote trade relations between the two countries and enhance the friendship between the people of the two countries."

    我六大人民团体分电日本人民
    欢迎日本人民派代表参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【新华社二十三日讯】我国六大人民团体——中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会、中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会，于八月二十二日分别致电日本各阶层人民，热烈欢迎日本人民派遣代表来北京参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，并一致希望日本代表们在会后能到我国各地参观，借以增进中、日两国人民之间的友谊和团结，以便在保卫亚洲和平的伟大斗争中发挥出更大的力量。
    中华全国总工会在致日本工人的电文中说：“亚洲的和平与安全已遭受到严重的威胁。朝鲜停战谈判仍被拖延着和阻挠着，美国侵略者自发动灭绝人性的细菌战以后，最近又轰炸了鸭绿江发电厂，妄图扩大战争。在日本，在片面‘对日和约’宣布生效后，最近又通过了‘防止破坏活动法’，进一步剥夺日本人民的民主权利，加速日本的军国主义化，使在第二次世界大战中遭受日本帝国主义摧残的亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，重新感受新的战争威胁。日本工人在反对外国占领、争取民族独立、反对反动统治、争取人民的民主自由、以及争取亚洲与世界和平的伟大斗争中，表现了无比的英勇。我们热切地关怀着你们的每一个斗争。我们坚信，日本工人和中国工人团结一致的斗争，必能在制止美国帝国主义侵略、拯救亚洲和平的斗争中起重要作用。所以我们热烈拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，并热诚地欢迎日本工人派遣代表来参加大会。
    中华全国总工会在给日本工会总评议会、全日本产业别工会会议、日本工资共同斗争联络会和世界工联日本联络事务局的电文中说：“自今年六月亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议开过以后，亚洲及太平洋区域的和平运动已有了很大的发展。我们相信：大会如有日本工人代表参加，将更增加保卫和平的力量。”
    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅在致日本妇女的电文中说：“闻悉日本各界著名人士在大阪召开了参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议，我们非常兴奋。对于热爱和平、决心为拯救和平而积极斗争的日本妇女，我们表示衷心的敬意。我们相信你们一定会克服一切困难，选派自己的代表出席会议。”
    中华全国民主青年联合总会在致日本青年祖国战线的电文中指出：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议对于加强亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民的团结，对争取和平的斗争，无疑地将会有巨大的贡献。因此，日本青年祖国战线广泛动员全日本各阶层爱好和平的青年，不分政治见解、宗教信仰，推选自己的代表出席会议，讨论与日本人民和青年有切身关系的和平问题，是具有极其重要的意义的。中国青年决以全力支持日本青年争取和平的斗争，并祝他们获得胜利。
    中华全国学生联合会在致全日本学生自治会联合总会的电文中说：“中国学生曾遭受过帝国主义的长期侵略和压迫，知道和平的可贵，并决心把自己的力量献给保卫和平事业，我们相信，热爱和平、热爱祖国的日本青年学生，也一定会团结起来争取和平，使得日本青年不再遭受战争的浩劫。你们可以相信，中国学生一定用全力支持你们。我们等待着你们选派出席会议的代表，并热诚地邀请你们的代表们在会后访问中国各地，和中国广大学生见面。”
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会在致日本文化界、文学艺术界的电文中说：“日本人民在内外反动派压迫之下，表现了为和平、民主、独立、自由而斗争的勇气和决心。日本的文化界人士也和全国人民一样，正为这种斗争而尽着极可宝贵的努力。现在正当美国帝国主义的侵略战争严重地威胁着亚洲和世界和平的时候，我们两国人民和所有的科学家、教育家、文学家、艺术家、学者、教授们，应该更紧密地团结起来，为保卫和平、保卫文化而奋斗到底！”
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会在致日本工商界的电文中说：“日本工商业界有很多人士渴望和平、反对战争，因为战争贩子们的备战政策使日本的工商业萎缩，而美国的禁运措施又使日本的对外贸易受到了最大的阻碍。中、日两国的人民都热烈企望中、日两国和平相处，发展两国间的正常贸易关系。今年六月一日在北京签订的中日贸易协议，正表达了两国人民的愿望。我们热烈欢迎你们代表的到来，并在会后参观我国各方面的建设工作，以促进两国的贸易关系，增进两国人民的友谊。”
