    Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meetings are a Good Way to Lead Mutual Aid Teams
    Editor: This year, the leading cadres of the Fifth District of Shouyang County piloted the leadership method of "Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meetings" in Nanxia Village (including four administrative villages), and achieved good results. This spring, they led the mutual aid team leaders of these villages to hold several meetings, but because there was no timely inspection and summary after the meetings, they did not know what role each meeting played, so this type of meeting could not be sustained. Recently, the leading cadres of the Fifth District studied the experience of leading production in various places as reported in the newspapers and consciously established "Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meetings." They personally led the mutual aid team of Zhang Zhongzheng, a labor model in Nanxia Village, to create typical experiences; at certain times, they stipulated the content of the Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meetings in advance, asked everyone to prepare well, and solve problems at the meetings. This approach has indeed played a significant role. For example, the problem of "how to equate sideline production with agriculture" in the Nanxia Village mutual aid teams could not be solved for a long time. At the liaison meeting, they introduced and studied Zhang Zhongzheng's team's method of equating agricultural and sideline production, which solved the problem and consolidated and improved many mutual aid teams. The mutual aid team leaders all said, "The liaison meetings solve problems very well." Since the implementation of the liaison meetings, the number of mutual aid teams in Nanxia Village has quadrupled. In early August, all the cadres in the district who led production in the villages participated in the Mutual Aid Team Leader Liaison Meeting in Nanxia Village, preparing to learn from the experience and promote this leadership method throughout the district.

    互助组长接头会是领导互助组的好办法
    编辑同志：今年寿阳县五区领导干部在南下庄
    （包括四个行政村）试行了“互助组长接头会”的领导方法，收到了很好的效果。今年春天，他们领导这几个村的互助组长，开过几次会，但因会后没有及时检查总结，不知道每次会到底起了什么作用，因此这种会议没有能够坚持下来。最近，五区领导干部学习了报纸上介绍的各地领导生产的经验，自觉地建立了“互助组长接头会”。他们亲自领导南下庄劳动模范张中正的互助组，以便创造典型经验；到了一定时候，事先规定了召开互助组长接头会的内容，要大家作好准备，在会上解决问题。这种作法，确是起了不小作用。例如，南下庄互助组的“副业与农业结合怎样等价”的问题，长期不能解决，他们在接头会上介绍和研究了张中正组农副业结合的等价办法，便解决了这个问题，使许多互助组巩固和提高了。互助组长们都说：“接头会很解决问题”。实行接头会以来，南下庄的互助组已经发展了四倍。八月初，全区各村领导生产的干部都到南下庄参加了互助组长接头会，准备吸取经验，在全区推广这个领导方法。
