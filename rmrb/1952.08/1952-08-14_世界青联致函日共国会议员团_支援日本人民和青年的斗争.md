Xinhua News Agency, Prague: The Japanese Communist Party Parliamentary Group, in response to the bloody suppression by the American and Japanese reactionaries of the Japanese people participating in the May Day demonstrations, published an appeal to the world on May 24, calling on the people of the world to support the persecuted Japanese people. After receiving this appeal, the World Federation of Democratic Youth sent a letter to the Japanese Communist Party Parliamentary Group on July 10, expressing sympathy and support for the struggle of the Japanese people and youth. The letter from the World Federation of Democratic Youth stated:

    The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has lodged a serious protest against the appalling police brutality in suppressing the May Day demonstrations. It now reiterates its protest, demanding the immediate release of those arrested and the punishment of the criminal murderers.

    On behalf of millions of young people around the world, we express our deepest sympathy and support to the Japanese people and youth who are fighting for peace and independence.

    We are convinced that no persecution measures can shake the common will of the Japanese people and youth. On the contrary, their struggle will only be strengthened, because they believe that the cause of peace will surely triumph, and the happy tomorrow of the people of all countries will surely come.

    世界青联致函日共国会议员团
    支援日本人民和青年的斗争
    【新华社讯】布拉格消息：日本共产党国会议员团，为美、日反动派残暴镇压参加“五一”节示威游行的日本人民的流血事件，曾在五月二十四日发表告世界书，向世界人民呼吁声援遭受迫害的日本人民。世界民主青年联盟在收到这一呼吁书之后，已在七月十日致函日共国会议员团，表示同情和支持日本人民和青年的斗争。世界民主青年联盟的信说：
    世界民主青年联盟书记处已对这种镇压“五一”节示威游行的骇人听闻的警察行凶行为提出严重抗议，现在它再度提出抗议，要求立即释放被捕者，并惩办犯罪的凶手。
    我们谨代表全世界千百万青年，对为争取和平与独立而斗争的日本人民和青年表示最深切的同情和支持。
    我们确信任何迫害措施都不能动摇日本人民和青年的共同意志，相反地，他们的斗争只会加强，因为他们相信和平事业一定会胜利，各国人民幸福的明天一定会来到。
