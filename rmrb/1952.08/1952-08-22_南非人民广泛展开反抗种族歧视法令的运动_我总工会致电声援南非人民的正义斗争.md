Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: The non-white people of the Union of South Africa have launched a large-scale movement against unjust racial discrimination laws in all central regions of the country since June 26th. A large number of non-white people have formed volunteer teams and taken organized actions to break through the constraints of various fascist racial laws formulated by the South African authorities. The Malan government of South Africa has carried out brutal suppression of this movement, ordering the arrest of Sisulu and Kachalia, joint secretaries of the National Action Committee of the African National Congress of the Union of South Africa and the South African Indian Congress, who led the movement, as well as many others. By mid-July, more than 450 people had been arrested. On July 15th and 16th, the Malan government also sentenced Dadoo, Chairman of the South African Indian Congress, Kothong, a member of the Executive Committee of the African National Congress, Max, Chairman of the Transvaal Branch of the African National Congress, and Popapuke, the secretary, who had been unreasonably detained earlier, to imprisonment.

    A communique issued by the National Action Committee of the African National Congress of the Union of South Africa and the South African Indian Congress pointed out that South African fascists are meticulously imitating Hitler, using the despotic "Suppression of Communism Act" to prevent the people's resistance movement. However, this brutal act will only arouse more resolute resistance from the South African people. The communique stated, "The scale of the resistance movement is growing deeper and wider, and this movement is penetrating into new regions and new corners of the country. The forces of freedom have united as never before."

    After receiving the communique issued by the National Action Committee of the African National Congress of the Union of South Africa and the South African Indian Congress regarding the situation of the South African people's movement against racial discrimination laws, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Congress to express its support. The telegram stated: "The Chinese working people fully support the just struggle of the non-white people (including Indians and other Asian people) of South Africa against racial discrimination and national oppression policies and for basic rights. We wish you to strengthen your unity and achieve final victory in the struggle against imperialist enslavement." At the same time, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to Malan, the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, protesting the South African government's brutal measures to suppress the South African people, demanding an immediate end to the persecution, the abolition of racial discrimination laws, and the immediate release of all persons arrested and sentenced for resisting unjust laws.

    南非人民广泛展开反抗种族歧视法令的运动
    我总工会致电声援南非人民的正义斗争
    【新华社二十一日讯】南非联邦非白色人民从六月二十六日开始在全国各中心地区展开大规模反抗不公正的种族歧视法令的运动。大批非白色人民组成志愿队，采取有组织的行动，冲破南非当局制定的各项法西斯种族法令的约束。南非马兰政府对这个运动进行横暴的镇压，下令逮捕了领导这个运动的南非联邦非洲人国民大会与南非印度人大会全国行动委员会的联合书记西苏鲁和加查里亚以及其他许多人，到七月中旬为止，被捕者已有四百五十多人。马兰政府还在七月十五日和十六日，把前此无理拘禁的南非印度人大会主席达杜、非洲人国民大会执行委员会委员柯吞、非洲人国民大会川斯伐尔省分会主席麦克斯和书记波帕朴等人分别判处徒刑。
    南非联邦非洲人国民大会与南非印度人大会全国行动委员会发表的公报指出：南非法西斯分子无微不至地模仿着希特勒，他们用专制的“镇压共产主义法”来阻止人民的反抗运动。但是，这种横暴的行为只有激起南非人民更坚决的反抗。公报说：“反抗运动的规模已日益深广，这个运动正在深入到全国新的地区和新的角落里去。自由的力量已空前地团结起来。”
    中华全国总工会在接到南非联邦非洲人国民大会与南非印度人大会全国行动委员会所发表的关于南非人民反抗种族歧视法令运动情况的公报以后，已去电该会表示声援，电文说：“中国劳动人民完全支持南非的非白色人民（包括印度人及其他亚洲人民）反对种族歧视和民族压迫政策与争取基本权利的正义斗争。祝你们加强团结，在反对帝国主义奴役的斗争中取得最后胜利。”中华全国总工会同时致电南非联邦政府总理马兰，抗议南非政府镇压南非人民的暴戾措施，要求立即停止迫害行为，取消种族歧视法律，并立即释放一切因反抗不公正的法律而被捕和被判刑的人士。
