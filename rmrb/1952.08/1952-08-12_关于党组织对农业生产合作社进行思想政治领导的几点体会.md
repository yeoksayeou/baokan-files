    Some Experiences in the Ideological and Political Leadership of Party Organizations in Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Li Jianbai, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    The mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural Heilongjiang Province started relatively early, and the vast majority of farmers have participated in various types of mutual aid groups. Since last year, individual mutual aid groups have developed in the direction of agricultural production cooperatives, and relatively well-established permanent mutual aid groups have also demanded to develop into agricultural production cooperatives. Based on this actual situation and the guidelines instructed by the higher-level Party committee, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee decided to pilot agricultural production cooperatives with emphasis and planning. In the process of piloting, due to the Party committee's attention to ideological and political leadership, the piloting work went relatively smoothly.
    
    I. The Party's Ideological and Political Work in the Process of Organizing Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    Many agricultural production cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province were established on the basis of several years of mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the past few years of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, farmers have gained many benefits: in the initial recovery of production, they overcame the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power; in the continued development of production, the role of mutual aid and cooperation has been further developed, and farmers have further realized the benefits of being organized. In particular, the more consolidated permanent mutual aid groups in the past few years, relying on the Party's regular leadership and the efforts of well-known labor models in the province, have greatly increased land yields. From these facts, farmers clearly see that only by organizing can they move towards prosperity. On the other hand, many farmers have personally experienced that small mutual aid groups can no longer meet the requirements for further development of production; the provincial labor model conference held this spring also criticized capitalist tendencies, making everyone clearly understand the path of agricultural production cooperatives; coupled with the emergence of individual agricultural production cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province, the Party's call to "improve the form of mutual aid and cooperation organizations and establish agricultural production cooperatives" has been widely welcomed by the masses of farmers.

    Despite this, farmers still exposed many ideological problems in the process of organizing agricultural production cooperatives. Some farmers mistakenly thought that agricultural production cooperatives were "merging everything together," so some agricultural production cooperatives were formed according to the idea of "merging everything together." Some participated with a try-it-and-see attitude because of insufficient understanding and confidence in the nature and future of agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, in a family, some people joined the cooperative, and some did not; or some land was put into the cooperative, and some was not; or some livestock was put into the cooperative, and some was not, and even only bad land was put into the cooperative, and good land was not. On specific issues, farmers had even more ideological problems. For example, how to allocate fodder when horses are fed together? How to provide seeds for large-scale planting? ... Of course, farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives also have a sense of excitement. They feel that agricultural production cooperatives are much more advanced than other forms of production organization. "Taking the first step towards 'society' (socialism) is admired and learned by everyone."

    In the process of organizing agricultural production cooperatives, the ideological changes of Party members and cadres are also complex. For example, a few Party members and cadres understood agricultural production cooperatives from the perspective of farmers' egalitarianism, so they adopted the method of "merging everything together" when organizing agricultural production cooperatives; a few cadres were greedy for more and bigger, and organized agricultural production cooperatives everywhere regardless of whether the conditions were mature; a few Party members and cadres adopted simplified and average apportionment methods when solving specific problems in organizing agricultural production cooperatives; a few Party members and cadres accommodated the ideas of backward members, did not formulate articles of association, and even falsely reported the achievements of agricultural production cooperatives in order to deceive higher-level approval. The existence of these phenomena aggravated the Party committee's responsibility for ideological and political leadership in the process of piloting agricultural production cooperatives.

    The Party organizations in Heilongjiang Province adopted a positive but cautious approach in piloting agricultural production cooperatives. Because leading farmers to organize agricultural production cooperatives is a new task, and everyone has no experience, a little carelessness will undermine the prestige of agricultural production cooperatives among the masses, create more difficulties for organizing agricultural production cooperatives in the future, and affect the current patriotic production increase campaign and the lives of farmers. Therefore, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee strictly stipulated that each county should only focus on piloting one or two agricultural production cooperatives, and they must be run well in order to gain experience and set a good example for farmers. When selecting key points, it is required to select places where the foundation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is better, the leadership of the local branch is stronger, and all aspects of work have a certain foundation. In addition, the county party committee must directly lead all key pilot areas for agricultural production cooperatives, and the provincial party committee must also provide regular care. In some places, the masses are very enthusiastic and firmly demand to pilot agricultural production cooperatives. In response, the Party organization examines and controls them, and strengthens guidance. For some agricultural production cooperatives that do not meet the conditions, the members should be persuaded to change to permanent mutual aid groups, and then organized after the conditions are met. Obviously, if the above methods are not or cannot be mastered, it will inevitably cause confusion.

    Secondly, strengthen the education of members of agricultural production cooperatives. In addition to explaining the correctness of the Party's agricultural collectivization policy, it is also necessary to publicize the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives based on the farmers' personal experience that small mutual aid groups cannot meet the requirements for further development of production. It is necessary to make everyone understand that the method of land pooling, collective operation, and dividend distribution according to shares can eliminate the disputes often caused by small mutual aid groups in solving the problems of cultivation sequence and rotation of hoeing; agricultural production cooperatives have more convenient conditions than mutual aid groups for exerting the effectiveness of new farm tools and improving technology; collective feeding of horses, collective cultivation, and collective meals during busy farming seasons can save labor, save time, improve efficiency, and give full play to everyone's expertise. In addition, it is necessary to specifically explain the method of dividend distribution according to shares, eliminate concerns about being at a disadvantage, and make farmers realize that participating in agricultural production cooperatives is definitely not at a disadvantage, and make them understand that the method of agricultural production cooperatives is more reasonable than that of mutual aid groups. Criticize the wrong understanding of agricultural production cooperatives and the wrong practices in organizing agricultural production cooperatives, and continuously strengthen collectivism education and education on the future of social development. In terms of leadership, it is necessary to oppose the impatience and greed for more and bigger ideas in organizing agricultural production cooperatives, carefully examine the agricultural production cooperatives that have been formed, educate the cadres leading agricultural production cooperatives to master the guidelines, move forward steadily, and specifically solve the various specific problems in agricultural production cooperatives, so as to obtain a solid foundation for agricultural production cooperatives from the beginning of their establishment in all aspects.

    II. The Party's Ideological and Political Work in Consolidating Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    After the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, the Party needs to carry out a series of ideological and political work to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives. Generally speaking, the leadership is prone to breathe a sigh of relief after the formation of agricultural production cooperatives. For example, some leading cadres neglected the complexity of agricultural production cooperatives and relaxed their leadership because they were satisfied with the high enthusiasm of the masses. In fact, when agricultural production is fully launched, how the leadership, especially the county leadership, maintains regular leadership over agricultural production cooperatives while taking care of various aspects of work—solving many specific problems in agricultural production, launching a comprehensive patriotic production increase campaign in rural areas, and paying attention to the leadership of various types of mutual aid groups that exist in large numbers in rural areas—is very important. Only in this way can we gain experience and set a good example. Therefore, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee often reminds Party committees at all levels to allocate a certain amount of effort to systematically study and solve various problems in agricultural production cooperatives in a timely manner to ensure the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives and prepare conditions for further agricultural collectivization.

    In newly formed agricultural production cooperatives, the common phenomenon is that planning and organization are not strong. Farmers are very unfamiliar with production and management, and cannot fully exert the production efficiency of agricultural production cooperatives, that is, they cannot fully exert their superiority. This is manifested in having a complete plan, but no specific implementation of the plan. For example, when cultivating, there is no specific calculation of how long it will take, how much labor will be needed, and no order of cultivation is set, and they are done when they are thought of. And everyone is satisfied with completing the cultivation on time, or completing it earlier than usual, but cannot make careful calculations and strive to increase income more. Secondly, although agricultural production cooperatives already have a general organization and division of labor, there are no necessary cultivation teams when cultivating, and the division of labor is not fixed, and work is often temporarily assigned. Many jobs are roughly estimated, a few more people are not idle, and a few less people can also complete it. And the labor discipline of some agricultural production cooperatives is very lax, and members can work if they want to, and they can take a break if they don't want to. Some members say: "Anyway, if you work one day less, you will record one day less work, and no one cares if you suffer a loss." The attendance rate of some agricultural production cooperatives sometimes only reaches 60% to 70%, and there is a serious phenomenon of "underemployment" and "absenteeism," which greatly affects production. Therefore, the main reason for the above phenomenon is that those who participate in agricultural production cooperatives, whether cadres or farmers, were accustomed to small-scale agricultural management in the past, and accustomed to doing things when they thought of them. On the other hand, farmers' individualism also often conflicts with the collective interests of agricultural production cooperatives, and some people sometimes put their personal interests first. In order to overcome these shortcomings, in addition to strengthening education on organization and planning for members, the Party organization must also strengthen ideological education on collectivism to promote the transition of farmers' thinking from individualism to collectivism, and help them transition from small-scale management to larger-scale management.

    In order to strengthen the organization and planning of agricultural production cooperatives, attention must be paid to establishing and implementing fair and reasonable systems. Of course, in the beginning of the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, it is impossible to try to establish complex systems all at once, but we must not ignore the establishment of fair and reasonable systems because of this. Now some agricultural production cooperatives only record missed work, not actual work, and do not distinguish between skilled and unskilled labor, and light and heavy work when recording work hours. Naturally, there will be bad phenomena such as everyone rushing to do light work and arriving late and leaving early. If the leadership has partiality in handling problems, it will cause more chaos. Therefore, in addition to inspiring everyone's enthusiasm, the Party committee must also help establish fair and reasonable systems. Because establishing fair and reasonable systems in agricultural production cooperatives is one of the basic methods to consolidate labor discipline; it is also the key to consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. Now the Party organization in Heilongjiang Province is promoting various reasonable work recording methods.

    In addition, the Party committee must ensure that there is full democratic life within the agricultural production cooperative, and the leading personnel of the agricultural production cooperative must seriously promote democratic style. This is a very important thing. The cadres leading agricultural production cooperatives originally have a certain prestige among the masses. However, some individuals began to develop a sense of pride and complacency after the formation of agricultural production cooperatives. And some farmers do not ask about the leadership's affairs and bury themselves in work. On the surface, it seems that there is no problem, but in reality, it is not so. In this way, it is necessary to ensure that there is full democratic life within the cooperative, promote criticism and self-criticism, so that everyone cares about the affairs of the cooperative, actively puts forward opinions, cherishes public property, maintains collective interests, so that the whole cooperative is well-informed, and problems can be solved in a timely manner. This is the most practical collectivism education.

    Farmers' participation in agricultural production cooperatives is another step forward on the road of agricultural collectivization; but many people still have the ideas of individual economy and capitalist economy. For example, some farmers feel that collective labor is too tense and unfree; some feel that if they do not participate in agricultural production cooperatives, they can operate independently, which is both free and profitable; some feel that if they do not participate in agricultural production cooperatives, they can also find some work to supplement their income... This requires the Party committee to conduct ideological and political education frequently to solve these problems. As for paying attention to improving farmers' production technology and criticizing conservative ideas throughout the entire production process, it should not be ignored.

    In order to carry out regular political mobilization work within agricultural production cooperatives, the Party's organizational structure must also be adjusted according to the organization of agricultural production cooperatives. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee has initially stipulated that district cadres who are separated from production should concurrently serve as political workers and conduct systematic political work for members. Many agricultural production cooperatives have been initially consolidated because they can get the Party's regular leadership.

    The above are some experiences of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee on the ideological and political leadership of agricultural production cooperatives. Because agricultural production cooperatives are still in the initial stage of creation and key promotion, these experiences are very incomplete and can only be used as a reference.

    关于党组织对农业生产合作社进行思想政治领导的几点体会
    中共黑龙江省委宣传部部长  李剑白
    黑龙江省农村的互助合作运动开始较早，绝大多数农民都已参加了各种类型的互助组。从去年起，有个别互助组向农业生产合作社的方向发展，比较定型的有基础的常年互助组也都有向农业生产合作社发展的要求。根据这种实际情况和上级党委所指示的方针，黑龙江省委决定有重点有计划地试办农业生产合作社。在试办过程中，由于党委注意了思想政治领导工作，试办工作比较顺利。
    一、在组织农业生产合作社过程中党的思想政治工作
    黑龙江省的很多农业生产合作社，都是在几年来的互助合作运动基础上建立起来的。在几年来的互助合作运动中，农民得到了很多利益：在初期恢复生产中，克服了劳力、畜力不足的困难；在继续发展生产的过程中，互助合作的作用更加发挥，农民进一步体会到组织起来的好处。特别是几年来较巩固的常年互助组，依靠了党的经常领导和全省著名劳动模范的努力，土地的产量已大大提高。从这些事实中，农民清楚地看到，只有组织起来才能走向富裕。另一方面，有很多农民亲身体验到小型互助组已经不能满足进一步发展生产的要求；今春举行的全省劳动模范大会上又批判了资本主义倾向，使大家明确地认识了农业生产合作社的道路；加上黑龙江省已有个别农业生产合作社的组织出现，所以党的“提高互助合作组织形式，成立农业生产合作社”的号召，受到了农民群众的普遍欢迎。
    尽管如此，在组织农业生产合作社的过程中，农民仍然暴露了许多思想问题。有的农民误以为农业生产合作社就是“归大堆”，因而有的农业生产合作社是按照“归大堆”的想法组成的。有的因为对农业生产合作社的性质、前途认识不足，信心不高，而抱着试试看的态度参加的。因而一家之中，一部分人入社，一部分人不入社；或一部分土地入社，一部分土地不入社；或一部分牲口入社，一部分牲口不入社，甚至只拿坏地入社，不拿好地入社。在具体问题上，农民的思想问题更多。例如马在一起喂，草料怎么摊？大田播种，种籽怎么出？……当然，参加农业生产合作社的农民，也有一种兴奋的情绪，他们感觉到农业生产合作社比其他生产组织形式都先进得多，“奔‘社会’（社会主义）比别人先走一步，大家羡慕，人人学习”。
    在组织农业生产合作社的过程中，党员、干部的思想变化也是复杂的。例如：有少数党员、干部，是从农民的平均主义思想出发去了解农业生产合作社的，因而在组织农业生产合作社时，也就采用了“归大堆”的办法；有少数干部贪多图大，不管条件是否成熟，到处组织农业生产合作社；有少数党员干部在解决组织农业生产合作社中的具体问题时，采取了简单化的平均摊派的办法；有少数党员干部迁就落后社员的思想，不订立章程，甚至还有假报农业生产合作社的成绩，借以骗取上级承认、批准的。这些现象的存在，加重了党委在试办农业生产合作社的过程中的思想政治领导的责任。
    黑龙江省的党组织在试办农业生产合作社时，采取了积极而又慎重的方针。因为领导农民组织农业生产合作社是一件新的工作，大家都没有经验，稍一不慎就会在群众中破坏了农业生产合作社的威信，给今后组织农业生产合作社造成更多的困难；并且会影响到当前的爱国增产运动，影响到农民的生活。所以黑龙江省委严格规定每县只能重点试办一两个农业生产合作社，而且必须办好，以便取得经验，给农民作好样子。在选择重点时，要求必须选择这样的地方：生产互助合作运动的基础较好，当地支部的领导较强，各方面的工作也都有一定的基础。此外，凡是重点试办农业生产合作社的地方，县委须直接加以领导，省委也要经常予以照顾。有的地方，群众积极性很高，坚决要求试办农业生产合作社。对此，党组织加以审查和掌握，并加强指导。对一些确实不具备条件的农业生产合作社，要说服社员，让他们改为常年互助组，待条件具备后再组织。很显然，如果没有或不能掌握上述的办法，必然会引起混乱的。
    其次，加强对农业生产合作社社员的教育。这除了说明党的农业合作化的政策的正确性以外，还要根据农民的切身体验——小型互助组不能适应进一步发展生产的要求，来宣传农业生产合作社的优越性。要使大家明白：土地入股，集体经营，按股分红的办法，可以消除小型互助组在解决耕作先后、轮流铲趟问题中常常引起的纠纷；农业生产合作社对发挥新农具效能，提高技术，比互助组有更多便利条件；集体喂马，集体耕作，农忙时集体吃饭，可以节省人工，节省时间，提高效率，并能发挥大家的专长。此外，要具体地解释入股分红的方法，消除怕吃亏等顾虑，使农民认识到参加农业生产合作社决不吃亏，而且使他们懂得农业生产合作社的办法比互助组的更加合理。批判对农业生产合作社的错误了解，以及组织农业生产合作社时的错误作法，不断地加强集体主义教育和社会发展前途的教育。在领导方面则必须反对在组织农业生产合作社中的急躁情绪和贪多图大的思想，认真审查已组成的农业生产合作社，教育领导农业生产合作社的干部掌握方针，稳步前进，具体解决农业生产合作社中的各种具体问题，从各方面求得农业生产合作社在组成之初就有巩固的基础。
    二、巩固农业生产合作社中的党的思想政治工作
    在农业生产合作社建立之后，党须要进行一系列的巩固农业生产合作社的思想政治工作。一般地说，领导方面容易在组成农业生产合作社之后，松一口气。例如有些领导干部就因为满足于群众情绪高，劲头大，忽视了农业生产合作社的复杂性而放松了领导。事实上，当农业生产全面展开的时候，领导方面，特别是县的领导方面，如何在照顾多方面的工作——解决农业生产上的许多具体问题，发动农村的全面的爱国增产运动，以及注意领导农村大量存在的各种类型的互助组的情况下，保持对农业生产合作社的经常领导是非常重要的。只有这样，才能取得经验，作好样子。所以黑龙江省委经常提醒各级党委必须分出一定的力量，系统地研究和及时解决农业生产合作社中的各种问题，以保证农业生产合作社的巩固和发展，为农业的进一步合作化准备条件。
    在新组成的农业生产合作社中，普遍存在的现象是计划性和组织性不强。农民对生产经营很生疏，不能充分发挥农业生产合作社的生产效能，就是说不能充分发挥其优越性。这表现在有整个计划，但没有具体执行计划。例如耕作时没有具体计算需要多长时间，需要多少劳动力，没有定出耕作次序，现想现作。并且大家满足于按时耕作完毕，或比一般提前完成，而不能精打细算，争取更多地增加收入。其次，农业生产合作社虽已有了一般的组织和分工，但在耕作时却没有必要的耕作队，分工不固定，常常临时分配工作。许多活都是大约估计的，多几个人闲不着，少几个人也可以干完。而且有些农业生产合作社的劳动纪律很松懈，社员愿干就干，不愿干就可以歇工。有的社员就这样说：“反正少干一天活少记一天工，自己吃亏别人管不着。”有的农业生产合作社的出勤率有时只达到百分之六七十，存在着严重的“窝工”“旷工”现象，影响生产很大。所以造成上述现象，主要是因为参加农业生产合作社的，无论干部，无论农民，过去都习惯于小规模的农业经营，习惯于现想现作。另一方面，农民的个人主义思想也时时和农业生产合作社的集体利益发生矛盾，有些人有时就把个人利益放在了第一位。为了克服这些缺点，党组织除应对社员加强组织性和计划性的教育外，还须要加强集体主义的思想教育，以促进农民思想从个人主义向集体主义的过渡，帮助他们从小经营过渡到较大的经营。
    为了加强农业生产合作社的组织性和计划性，必须注意建立和执行公平合理的制度。当然，在农业生产合作社开始建立的时候，也不能企图一下建立起复杂的制度，但决不能因此而不注意建立公平合理的制度。现在就有些农业生产合作社记工时，只记误工，不记上工，对于劳动技术熟练不熟练，活轻活重，一律不分。这样自然就会发生大家抢干轻活和迟到早退等等的不良现象。如果领导方面在处理问题时再有亲疏远近之分，那就会造成更多的混乱现象。因此，党委除了应启发大家的积极性外，还必须帮助建立公平合理的制度。因为在农业生产合作社建立公平合理的制度，是巩固劳动纪律的基本方法之一；也是巩固农业生产合作社的关键。现在黑龙江省的党组织，正在推行各种合理的记工法。
    此外，党委还必须保证农业生产合作社内部有充分的民主生活，农业生产合作社的领导人员则须认真发扬民主作风，这是一件十分重要的事情。领导农业生产合作社的干部在群众中本来都有一定的威信。但其中有个别人在组成农业生产合作社之后，开始产生了骄傲自满的情绪。而有一部分农民对领导方面的事情不闻不问，埋头干活。表面上看来没有问题，实际上并不如此。这样就必须保证社内有充分的民主生活，发扬批评和自我批评，使大家关心社里的事情，积极提出意见，爱护公共财产，维护集体利益，使全社上下通气，有问题能够及时得到解决。这是一种最实际的集体主义教育。
    农民参加了农业生产合作社，是在农业合作化的道路上又进了一步；但是许多人还残存着个体经济、资本主义经济的思想。例如：有的农民感觉集体劳动太紧张，不自由；有的感到如果不参加农业生产合作社，那就可以单独经营，这又自由，又多得利；有的感到如果不参加农业生产合作社，还可以找些活作，补助收入……这就要求党委须经常地进行思想政治教育，以解决这些问题。至于在整个生产过程中，注意提高农民的生产技术，批判保守思想，也是不应忽视的。
    为了在农业生产合作社内部进行经常的政治鼓动工作，党的组织机构也必须按农业生产合作社的组织加以调整。黑龙江省委已经初步规定了由脱离生产的区干部兼任政治工作人员，向社员进行系统的政治工作。有不少农业生产合作社因为能够得到党的经常的领导，因而初步巩固。
    以上是关于黑龙江省党组织对农业生产合作社的思想政治领导的几点体会。因为农业生产合作社还处在初创和重点推广的阶段，这些经验是很不完全的，仅可作为参考。
