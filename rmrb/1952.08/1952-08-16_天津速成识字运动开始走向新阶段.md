    The Tianjin Rapid Literacy Movement Enters a New Stage

    The rapid literacy movement in Tianjin has been unfolding systematically and gradually. To date, there are over 3,000 literacy classes in various districts and factories throughout the city, with over 170,000 students. The work of training teachers is nearing completion, and the entire movement is beginning to move towards a stage of universal mobilization. It is estimated that a new high tide will appear in the next two to three months.

    At the beginning of January this year, Tianjin began to hold experimental classes for the rapid literacy method. At that time, two typical classes were identified, namely a textile worker class (studying intensively away from production) and a mass amateur experimental class (including dispersed workers, shop assistants, housewives, small vendors, etc.). At the same time, thirty-one teachers from workers' spare-time schools and mass literacy spare-time schools were selected to observe and learn in the classes to train teachers. The experimental results were very good, and the general students achieved the required results within the specified time. The experience of training teachers with the class proved that the method of teaching and training at the same time is the most effective method for training a large number of teachers in a short period of time.

    After the victorious conclusion of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau first formulated the city's 1952 literacy movement work plan based on the experimental results and combined with the specific conditions of Tianjin, and determined to solve the literacy problem of 320,000 illiterates and semi-illiterates in 1952. Among them, 120,000 are industrial workers, 70,000 are other workers, 50,000 are farmers, and 80,000 are general working citizens and housewives. The basic literacy problem of existing illiterate and semi-illiterate workers in factories and enterprises with more than 300 people should be solved within this year. At the same time, literacy movement committees were established at all levels throughout the city. Mayor Huang Jing served as the director of the Municipal Literacy Movement Committee, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Huang Huoqing, and Director of the Municipal Culture and Education Committee Huang Songling served as deputy directors, and Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Liang Hanbing served as the secretary-general. The Municipal People's Government also issued the "Decision on Promoting the Rapid Literacy Method and Carrying out the Literacy Movement," explaining the great political significance of eliminating illiteracy among workers and peasants and its importance to the development of industrial and agricultural production. Subsequently, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also issued the "Instructions on Promoting the Rapid Literacy Method and Carrying out the Literacy Movement," requiring "all learning organizations such as workers' spare-time schools, literacy classes, and literacy groups under the jurisdiction of trade unions at all levels, which are equivalent to the level of primary classes in spare-time schools, should uniformly use the rapid literacy method for teaching. We should continuously create and summarize teaching experience, exchange it in a timely manner, and plan to train a large number of mass teachers among the working masses to lay the foundation for the widespread development of the literacy movement." At the same time, the Tianjin Municipal Women's Federation also formulated a work plan for carrying out the rapid literacy movement among women based on the decision of the Municipal People's Government, deciding that the focus of work in June, July, and August would be on training teachers, and after September, it would shift to massively mobilizing and organizing women to participate in literacy learning. This mobilized forces from all sides to carry out this work.

    In order to ensure the glorious task of solving the literacy problem of 320,000 people in the city in 1952, it is first necessary to train teachers. Since the relevant leading organs of Tianjin Municipality began experimenting with the rapid literacy method in January this year, they have grasped this work and successively trained the first batch of 628 teachers in nine experimental classes using the methods of "observing with the class, studying documents, and group discussions." After returning to their respective districts, industrial trade unions, and factories, these teachers became the backbone of promoting the rapid literacy method. Under the leadership of the relevant parties, they opened experimental classes one after another, served as lecturers, and absorbed workers, teachers and students from mass spare-time schools and worker-peasant normal schools, as well as some literate women to observe and learn, further training a large number of teachers. To date, the city has trained 4,044 full-time teachers and 103 mass teachers (i.e., non-full-time "little teachers"). Starting in July, all kinds of amateur primary schools in the city have completely adopted the rapid literacy method, first solving the literacy problem of illiterates and semi-illiterates. It is planned to train a large number of mass teachers among the third and fourth grade students of the current amateur primary schools and the worker-peasant laboring masses. This will lay the foundation for the development of the literacy movement throughout the city.

    Based on our experience, the experience of "observing with the class, studying documents, combined with discussions" in training teachers is valuable. All districts and industrial trade unions have achieved great results in training teachers with this experience. Throughout the entire internship, we repeatedly adopted methods such as organizing intern teachers to listen to the teaching reports of lecturers, observing teaching in the field, repeated discussions, in-depth understanding, collective lesson preparation, trial drafting of lesson plans, group demonstrations, large group demonstrations, revising lesson plans, and making summaries, to dispel layers of doubts for the intern teachers. At the same time, for teachers with lower levels of education and a lack of experience in adult teaching, in addition to the above methods, we also added the process of group teaching, so that they could learn faster and correctly grasp the spirit and essence of this teaching method. However, in the process of training teachers, it must be emphasized that the rapid literacy method is a revolutionary teaching method that connects with reality and implements the mass line, and the requirements for teachers should be strict. Because this teaching method is not a purely technical issue, but a major innovation in teaching ideology. Therefore, attention should be paid to the ideological situation of intern teachers from beginning to end, and they should be continuously given political education, and their old teaching methods should be broken from the ideological level. They should be made to realize that if teachers lack a mass viewpoint and a high sense of responsibility to serve the people, it will be difficult for them to understand and grasp the characteristics of adults and the principles of going from easy to difficult, and it will be even more difficult to do a good job in mobilizing work in teaching. If the thoughts and feelings of teachers and students are not consistent and the students are mentally scattered, it will be difficult to complete the blitz-style combat learning task.

    Secondly, Tianjin's experience proves that it is necessary to fully estimate the enthusiasm and consciousness of the working people in learning culture, otherwise it will make the leadership passive. Although Tianjin decided to solve the literacy problem of 320,000 illiterates and semi-illiterates in 1952, in fact the literacy movement plans of various districts exceeded the tasks assigned by the city. At the same time, after mobilization and education, the learning enthusiasm of the students is very high, and many mass teachers (i.e., "little teachers") have emerged. Based on their own learning experience, they publicized everywhere, and some automatically organized literacy classes, absorbing a dozen or even dozens of illiterates nearby to teach the pinyin of phonetic symbols and blitz-style new words. The leadership should seize and lead this spontaneous learning activity to avoid falling into passivity.

### 天津速成识字运动开始走向新阶段

    天津速成识字运动开始走向新阶段
    天津市速成识字运动已经有计划地逐步地展开。到目前为止，全市各区、各厂已有识字班三千余班，学员超过十七万人。培养师资的工作即将完成，整个运动开始走向普遍发动的阶段。估计在最近二、三月内，即将出现新的高潮。
    今年一月初，天津开始举办速成识字法实验班，当时确定两种典型班，即纺织工人班（脱离生产集中学习）与群众业余实验班（包括分散的工人、店员、家庭妇女、小商贩等）。同时抽调工人业余学校及群众识字业余学校教师三十一人，随班见习，培养师资。实验结果很好，一般学员都在规定时间内取得了应有的成绩。而随班培养教师的经验证明了边教边训练的方法，是在短期内培养大批师资的最有效的方法。
    在“三反”“五反”运动胜利结束后，天津市教育局首先根据实验的结果，结合天津市的具体情况，制订了全市一九五二年的识字运动工作计划，确定在一九五二年内解决三十二万文盲、半文盲的识字问题。其中产业工人十二万人，其他工人七万人，农民五万人，一般劳动市民及家庭妇女八万人。三百人以上的工厂企业现有工人文盲半文盲基本的识字问题都要在这一年内解决。同时建立了全市各级识字运动委员会。由黄敬市长任市识字运动委员会主任，总工会黄火青主席，文教委员会黄松龄主任任副主任，由市教育局局长梁寒冰任秘书长。市人民政府并发布了“关于推行速成识字法开展识字运动的决定”，说明扫除工农文盲的重大政治意义及其对发展工农业生产的重要性。接着天津市总工会也发布了“关于推行速成识字法开展识字运动的指示”，要“各级工会所属工人业余学校、识字班、识字组等学习组织，凡相当于业余学校初级班程度的，应一律改用速成识字法教学。从中不断地创造和总结教学经验，及时加以交流，并有计划地大量地在职工群众中培养群众教师，为广泛开展识字运动打下基础”。同时天津市民主妇联也根据市人民政府的决定，制定了在妇女群众中开展速成识字运动的工作计划，决定在六、七、八三个月工作重点为培养师资，九月以后，即转入大量动员和组织妇女参加识字学习。这样就动员了各方面的力量来进行这个工作。
    为了保证一九五二年完成在全市范围内解决三十二万人的识字问题的光荣任务，首先必须培养师资。天津市各有关领导机关从今年一月间开始实验速成识字法以来，即抓住了这一工作，先后在九个实验班中，以“随班见习，研究文件，小组讨论”的方式，培养了第一批教师六百二十八名。这批教师回到各区、各产业工会和各工厂，就成了推广速成识字法的骨干，在各有关方面的领导下，纷纷开设实验班，担任主讲教员，吸收工人、群众业余学校和工农师范学校教师、学员以及部分识字妇女见习，进一步培养了大批师资。迄今为止，全市已培养出专职教师四千零四十四人，群众教员（即非专职的小先生）一百零三人。从七月份开始，全市各种业余初等学校已完全改用了速成识字法，首先解决文盲、半文盲的识字问题。计划在现在业余初等学校的三、四年级学员及工农劳动群众中再培养大批群众教师。这样即为全市开展识字运动奠定了基础。
    根据我们的体会，“随班见习、研究文件结合讨论”这一培养师资的经验，是宝贵的。各区和各产业工会以此经验培养师资，都收到很大成绩。在整个见习过程中，我们反复采用了组织见习教师听取主讲教员的教学报告、实地观摩教学、反复讨论、深入体会、集体备课、试拟教案、小组示教、大组示范、修改教案、作出小结等方法，为见习教员破除了层层疑难，同时对文化程度较低、缺乏成人教学经验的教师们，除采用以上方法外，还加入了小组试教的过程，通过试教使其较快的学会，并能正确的掌握这一教学方法的精神及实质。但在培养师资过程中，必须强调速成识字法是联系实际、贯彻群众路线的革命教学法，对教师的要求应该严格。因为这种教学法不是单纯技术问题，而是教学思想上的大革新。因此，要自始至终地注意见习教师的思想情况，不断向他们进行政治教育，从思想上打破他们老一套的教学方法。应该使他们认识到：如果教员缺乏群众观点和为人民服务的高度责任感，就很难领会和掌握成年人的特点和由易到难等原则，更难作好在教学中的鼓动工作。如果教员和学员的思想、感情不一致，学员精神涣散，就难以完成突击式的战斗的学习任务。
    其次，天津的经验证明：必须充分估计劳动人民学习文化的积极性与自觉性，否则就会使领导陷于被动。此次天津市虽然决定在一九五二年解决三十二万文盲、半文盲的识字问题，但事实上各区的识字运动计划超出了市里所布置的任务。同时经过动员、教育之后，学员们的学习情绪非常高涨，其中涌现了不少群众教师（即小先生）。他们根据自己的学习经验，到处宣传，有的自动组织了识字班，吸收附近的十几个甚至几十个文盲进行注音符号的拼音和突击生字的教学。这种自发的学习活动，领导上应当抓紧领导，以免陷于被动。
