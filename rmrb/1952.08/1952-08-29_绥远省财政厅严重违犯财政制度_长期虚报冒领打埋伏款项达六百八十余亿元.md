The Suiyuan Provincial People's Government Department of Finance's execution of financial regulations is extremely chaotic. Over the past two years, the amount of falsely reported, embezzled, and hidden funds, according to what has been ascertained, amounts to more than 68 billion yuan (RMB). The department did not seriously investigate these issues during the "Three-Anti" movement. It was not until the North China Administrative Committee Finance Bureau of the Central People's Government's State Council sent a financial inspection team to the department in mid-June that this problem was basically clarified.

The Suiyuan Provincial Department of Finance violated financial regulations and repeatedly submitted false budget and final accounts. For example, the department reported to the Central Ministry of Finance in its 1950 final accounts that "revenue and expenditure were equal," but inspection revealed that the province over-reported expenditures and under-reported revenues by a total of more than 26.76 million catties of millet, equivalent to 24.9 billion yuan. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the department continued to falsely report funds; when reporting the 1952 annual budget to the higher authorities, it under-reported 16.6 billion yuan for items such as the 1951 inventory, and under-reported 57 percent of the province's industrial and commercial tax allocation target, attempting to hide funds in the revenue. The Provincial Department of Finance used these illegal means to establish "small ledgers" and "small treasuries." The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance and the North China Administrative Committee of the State Council repeatedly instructed all localities to strictly abide by financial discipline and abolish "small ledgers" and "small treasuries," but the Provincial Department of Finance ignored them. It was not until this financial inspection team conducted an in-depth investigation and pointed out this problem that the department transferred the "small ledgers" into formal accounts and merged the "small treasuries" with the financial treasury around the end of June.

The Provincial Department of Finance did not truly comply with the budget final account reimbursement system. More than 8 million catties of millet pre-paid in 1950 have not yet been reimbursed; of the more than 140 billion yuan pre-paid in 1952, less than 4 billion yuan had been reimbursed by the beginning of July. The reimbursement system is very unsound, with some units only spending money without reimbursing, and some allocating funds without a budget or plan.

The seriousness of the Suiyuan Provincial Department of Finance's errors in not implementing financial regulations lies in the consistent concealment and false reporting over the past two years, deceiving the higher authorities; in the "Three-Anti" movement, no comprehensive and in-depth inspection was carried out. After the "Three-Anti" movement, when the North China Administrative Committee Finance Bureau sent an inspection team to conduct inspections, the leading cadres of the department were still perfunctory and evasive, and extremely dishonest. Director Jin Chongzhi affirmed in meetings or individual talks, and in the "Suiyuan Province Review of Violations of Financial Regulations in the Past Two Years" document, that only 10 billion yuan had been falsely reported. After the inspection team discovered some false reporting materials through preliminary inspection, Jin Chongzhi and Cao Yun, deputy director of the accounting department, still refused to admit it. After the inspection team went through account checking and verification and presented conclusive evidence, Jin Chongzhi said: "If we report truthfully, what kind of first-level finance is this?" After repeated research and discussion, he finally admitted his mistake. According to Cheng Linbin, director of the Provincial Finance and Economic Committee (former director of the Finance Department's Accounting Department), when Jin Chongzhi and others were clearing the inventory in February this year, Cheng Linbin and others estimated that the accumulated inventory over the past two years was 80 billion yuan, while Jin Chongzhi believed it was over 100 billion yuan. It can be seen that Jin Chongzhi "knew clearly" about the falsely reported and embezzled assets. Admitting only 10 billion yuan of false reporting and embezzlement in the "Three-Anti" movement was clearly intentional concealment. This kind of erroneous behavior is absolutely unacceptable, and the relevant cadres should not only make a profound review, but also be subject to the deserved punishment.

    绥远省财政厅严重违犯财政制度
　　长期虚报冒领打埋伏款项达六百八十余亿元
    绥远省人民政府财政厅执行财政制度极为混乱，两年来，虚报、冒领、打埋伏的款项，据已查清的，就有人民币六百八十余亿元。该厅在“三反”运动中并没有认真检查这些问题，直至中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会财政局于六月中旬派财政检查组到该厅进行检查后，始将这一问题基本上查清了。
    绥远省财政厅违反财政制度，屡次虚报预决算。例如，该厅一九五○年向中央财政部所报决算称“岁出岁入均相抵”，但经检查证实，全省多报支出与少报收入共合小米二千六百七十六万余斤，折款二百四十九亿元。“三反”运动后，该厅仍继续虚报款项；在向上级报告一九五二年度全年预算时，即少报一九五一年家底等项一百六十六亿元，并少报全省工商业税分配任务数的百分之五十七，企图在收入上打埋伏。该省财政厅用这些非法手段，建立了“小柜账”和“小柜库”。中央人民政府财政部及政务院华北行政委员会曾再三指示各地严守财政纪律，取消“小柜账”、“小柜库”，但该省财政厅竟置之不理。直到这次财政检查组进行深入检查，指出这一问题后，该厅始于六月底前后将“小柜账”转入正式账，“小柜库”与财政库合并。
    该省财政厅没有真正遵守预决算报销制度。一九五○年预付的粮款，至今尚有八百多万斤小米没有报销；一九五二年预付款一千四百余亿元，到七月初报销的尚不到四亿元。报销制度很不健全，有的单位只管花钱不管报销，有的在拨付款时既无预算又无计划。
    绥远省财政厅不执行财政制度的错误的严重性，在于两年来一贯的隐瞒虚报，欺蒙上级；在“三反”运动中，也未进行全面、深刻的检查。“三反”运动后，华北行政委员会财政局派检查组进行检查时，该厅领导干部还是应付、搪塞，极不老实。靳崇智厅长在会议上或个别谈话中，以及在“绥远省关于两年来违反财政制度检讨”文件内，都肯定只虚报一百亿元。检查组经过初步检查，发现了若干假报材料后，靳崇智和主计处副处长曹澐仍坚不承认，检查组历经查账、对证，拿出真凭实据后，靳崇智还说：“如果据实上报，这还算什么一级财政？”又经反复研究讨论，最后他才承认错误。据该省财政经济委员会程林彬处长（前财政厅主计处处长）谈，靳崇智在今年二月间和他清理家底时，程林彬等估计两年来家底累积有八百亿元，而靳崇智认为在千亿元以上，可见靳崇智对虚报冒领的家当是“心中有数”的，在“三反”运动中只承认虚报、冒领一百亿元，显然是有意的隐瞒。这种错误行为是绝对不能容许的，有关干部除了应作深刻检讨外，并应受到应得的处分。
