    Hungarian Exhibition Held in Beijing
    By Suo Beike, Minister of Foreign Trade of the Hungarian People's Republic
    August 20th is the day the Hungarian people celebrate the promulgation of their constitution. On this day, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic is holding an exhibition in Beijing, the capital of liberated China. This exhibition will further strengthen the relationship between the people of China and Hungary.
    The Hungarian people deeply understand the great historical significance of the friendship between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and also deeply understand the great historical significance of the increasingly close relationship between China and Hungary. Our people's leader, Rakosi, said at the Second Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party: "The victory of the Chinese revolution achieved by the heroic Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong is a clear demonstration of the growth and consolidation of the peace camp... A country with 475 million people, which had been a hunting ground and base for capitalists and imperialists for more than a century, has, with the sincere help of the Soviet Union, broken free from the shackles of imperialism and joined the camp of peace and socialism. This is a major victory of world historical significance, the greatest achievement in human progress since the Great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 and the defeat of fascism." Millions of Hungarian working people visited the New China Exposition held in Budapest last December, which shows the Hungarian people's deep sympathy and interest in the great construction work of the Chinese people. At the same time, the Hungarian people express their sincere admiration for the self-sacrificing spirit of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army in supporting the Korean people's struggle for freedom against American aggression.
    The exhibits displayed in the Hungarian Exhibition held in Beijing and the achievements of Hungary's socialist construction show that every Hungarian working man and woman is working diligently to do their daily work better to strengthen the peace camp. This exhibition introduces Hungary's peaceful construction, especially showing the progress the Hungarian people have made in the work of rebuilding their motherland with the constant assistance of the Soviet Union.
    Under the leadership of Comrade Rakosi, the Hungarian people have repeatedly defeated the sabotage conspiracies of American imperialism and its servants. Hungary, which was once a country ruled by feudal landlords and capitalists, has now become a People's Republic of working people. After successfully completing the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the Hungarian people immediately began to implement the first Five-Year Plan for socialist construction in 1950. According to this plan, Hungary will transform from a backward agricultural country into an industrial country with advanced agriculture. The achievements of our socialist industrialization are the main focus of this exhibition. When the Chinese people visit the exhibition, they will first get a glimpse of the development of our heavy industry. Our exhibition has the latest machine equipment: boring lathes, turning lathes, deep drilling equipment, all of which are designed and manufactured according to Soviet experience. The exhibition also displays the essence of Hungary's new transportation industry, such as models and samples of diesel engines, trains, buses, freight cars, "Csepel" brand motorcycles, and other transportation tools. There are also a large number of tractors manufactured by the "Red Star" tractor factory. In addition, there are electrical equipment, precision instruments, new geological equipment, optical instruments for medical and industrial use, which are sufficient to show the development of Hungarian industry. The exhibition also has many products of Hungarian light industry, such as radios, electrical appliances, textiles, shoes and other daily necessities. The situation of agricultural production occupies a prominent position in the exhibition, with photos and charts illustrating how state-owned farms and production cooperatives in socialist agricultural areas are increasing production.
    Simultaneous with the holding of the exhibition, we celebrate the second anniversary of trade between the Hungarian People's Republic and liberated China. Since the signing of the first Sino-Hungarian goods exchange agreement, our relationship has continued to develop. The cultural cooperation agreement concluded last year has brought new cultural wealth to both sides. The performance of Chinese young artists in Hungary and the visit of the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe to China are sufficient to illustrate this. In terms of our economic relations, according to the agreement signed last January, we import a large amount of major industrial raw materials and agricultural products, and ship machines and industrial products to the fraternal Chinese people in exchange. We have significantly increased the export of a larger amount of electrical equipment than last year. The Hungarian people regard this continuous expansion of relations with the People's Republic of China as one of the important factors in their progress. Comrade Rakosi once pointed out: Without the increasing contact with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, it would be impossible to complete our Five-Year Plan to build our future. He said: "The experience gained by the people's democratic countries and the exchange of experience are also very important, because the development of these countries is very similar to ours, so these useful experiences can be easily applied to our country... Our industrial development has greatly benefited from the help of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the fact that our trade with the Soviet Union and other friendly countries that implement planned economies is growing. The friendly mutual assistance between socialist countries is not comparable to the relationship between capitalist countries in the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Alliance." This new relationship of mutual assistance and friendly support in all aspects also links the people of China and Hungary. Under the leadership of the Soviet Union and the great Stalin, the people of China and Hungary are advancing confidently on the road of peaceful construction. An indestructible alliance unites us all in the victorious camp of peace.

    在北京举行的匈牙利展览会
    匈牙利人民共和国对外贸易部长  索贝克
    八月二十日是匈牙利人民庆祝他们宪法颁布的日子。在这一天，匈牙利人民共和国政府在解放后的中国的首都北京举办一个展览会。这个展览会将使中匈两国人民的关系更进一步密切起来。
    匈牙利人民深知苏联与人民民主国家的友谊的重大历史意义，也同样深知中匈两国关系日益密切的重大历史意义。我们人民的领袖拉科西在匈牙利劳动人民党第二次代表大会上说过：“英勇的中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下所取得的中国革命的胜利，是和平阵营的壮大和巩固的明证……拥有四亿七千五百万人民、曾经成为资本家和帝国主义者的猎场和基地达一个多世纪之久的国家，在苏联的真诚帮助下，挣脱了帝国主义的枷锁，参加了和平和社会主义阵营。这是具有世界历史意义的重大胜利，是自从一九一七年伟大的十月社会主义革命以来和战败法西斯以来，人类进步中最伟大的成就。”千百万匈牙利劳动人民在去年十二月参观了在布达佩斯举行的新中国博览会，这显示匈牙利人民对中国人民巨大建设工作的深切同情和兴趣。同时，匈牙利人民对于从事英雄战斗的中国人民志愿军在支援朝鲜人民争取自由反抗美国侵略者的战争中的自我牺牲精神，衷心表示敬佩。
    在北京举行的匈牙利展览会中所陈列的展览品以及匈牙利社会主义建设的成就，说明每一个匈牙利的劳动男女都是在辛勤地要把每天的工作做得更好以加强和平阵营。这一个展览会介绍了匈牙利的和平建设，特别是显示出匈牙利人民如何在苏联经常的援助下在重建祖国的工作中所获得的进步。
    在拉科西同志的领导下，匈牙利人民一次又一次击败了美帝国主义及其仆从的破坏阴谋。匈牙利曾经是一个封建地主和资本家统治的国家，现在已成为劳动人民的人民共和国了。匈牙利人民胜利地提前完成了三年计划后，在一九五○年立即开始实行建设社会主义的第一个五年计划。按照这个计划，匈牙利将从一个工农业落后的国家成为一个具有先进农业的工业国家。我们社会主义工业化的成就是这次展览会的主要中心。中国人民参观展览会时将首先获得关于我们重工业发展的景象。我们展览会中有最新式的机器器材：钻孔车床、旋床、深度钻孔设备，这些都是根据苏联经验而设计和制造的。展览会中并陈列出匈牙利新的运输工业的精华，像柴油发动机、火车、公共汽车、运货车、“赛佩尔”牌机器脚踏车等模型和样本以及其他运输工具。还有“红星”拖拉机厂制造的大量拖拉机。此外还有电气设备、精确仪器、新式的地质器材、医疗用及工业用的光学器械，这些都足以表明匈牙利工业的发展。展览会中还有许多匈牙利轻工业的制成品，如收音机、电气用具、纺织品、鞋子和其他日用品。农业生产情况在展览会中占着显著的地位，有照片和图表说明在社会主义农业区的各处国营农场和生产合作社如何在增加生产。
    与举行展览会的同时，我们庆祝匈牙利人民共和国与解放后的中国进行贸易的两周年。自从第一个中匈货物交换协定签订以来，我们的关系已经不断发展。去年缔结的文化合作协定，给我们双方带来文化上的新财富，中国青年艺术工作者在匈牙利的演出和匈牙利国家人民文工团在中国的访问都足以说明这一点。就我们的经济关系方面说，根据去年一月签订的协定，我们输入大量主要的工业原料和农产品，把机器和工业品运给亲如兄弟的中国人民以作交换。我们比去年显著地增多了更大量的电气器材的输出。匈牙利人民把这种与中华人民共和国联系的不断扩展看作是他们进步的重要因素之一。拉科西同志曾经指出：没有与苏联和人民民主国家日益增加的联系，就不可能完成我们的五年计划以建设我们的将来。他说：“各人民民主国家所获得的经验以及经验交流也是很重要的，因为这些国家的发展情况与我们的极为相似，因此这些有用的经验可以很容易应用到我们的国家里来……我们的工业发展大大得力于经济互助委员会的帮助，以及我们与苏联和实行计划经济的各友好国家之间贸易日益增长的事实。社会主义国家间的友好互助，与马歇尔计划和大西洋联盟的各资本主义国家之间的关系，是不可同日而语的。”在各个方面进行互助与友好支援的这样一种新的关系同样把中匈两国人民联结起来。在苏联和伟大的斯大林领导之下，中匈两国人民满怀信心地向着和平建设的大道迈进。一个不可摧毁的联盟把我们全体团结在胜利的和平阵营之中。
