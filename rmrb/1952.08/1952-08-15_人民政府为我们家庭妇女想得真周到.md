Reader's Letter:

    The People's Government is so Thoughtful for Us Housewives
    Editor: After reading the "Decision on Labor Employment Issues" of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, I was very excited.

    I am a housewife. After liberation, through study, I realized that if women want to achieve complete liberation, they must first strive for economic independence and avoid dependence. So I longed to find a job. Starting last year, I worked as a temporary replacement for a sick staff member at a school for more than a year. My health is relatively weak, and the full-day work, plus housework, often makes me feel tired and unable to cope. Later, that staff member recovered and returned to work, so I had to stay at home again. I hope to find a job soon, and I hope to find a part-time job (many housewives share the same hope). I was very anxious about this. Just then, the "Decision on Labor Employment Issues" was published. The People's Government is so thoughtful and truly understands the thoughts of us housewives, stating in the decision that we can work half a day or several hours a day. This is such a perfect consideration! I sincerely thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. I am determined to study hard and prepare to participate in work. Jing

    人民政府为我们家庭妇女想得真周到
    编辑同志：我读了中央人民政府政务院“关于劳动就业问题的决定”以后，非常兴奋。
    我是一个家庭妇女。解放后经过学习，我认识到妇女如果想得到彻底解放，首先要争取经济上的独立，不可有依赖性。所以我渴望着找到职业。从去年开始，我在某学校代理一位有病的职员工作了一年多。我的身体比较弱，全天的工作，加上家务，使我常常感到疲乏，支持不住。后来那位职员病愈复职，我就只好又呆在家里。我希望很快能找到工作，并且希望能找到工作半天的工作（很多家庭妇女都和我有同样的希望）。我为此十分着急。正在这时，“关于劳动就业问题的决定”公布了。人民政府可想得周到，真猜透了我们家庭妇女的心思，决定中说可以让我们每天工作半日或几小时。这是多么完满的照顾！我真衷心感谢毛主席、共产党。我决心努力学习，准备参加工作。静
