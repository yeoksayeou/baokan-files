    The notice requires all levels of Federations of Industry and Commerce (or preparatory committees) to follow the "Decision on Launching a Study Movement for Ideological Remolding Among People from All Walks of Life" and the "Notice on Leading People from All Walks of Life to Study the Common Program" of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and according to the resolution of the Preparatory Representatives Meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, mobilize local industrialists and businessmen to increase their attention to study, consciously participate in this great study movement, in order to comprehensively and deeply grasp the content and spirit of the Common Program in understanding and action. On the basis of the victory of the "Five-Antis" movement, further enhance the understanding of policies, consolidate the victory of the "Five-Antis" movement, and enable industry and commerce to further achieve healthy development.
    The notice points out: Studying the Common Program must be linked to reality, combined with one's own thoughts and business, and appropriately展开 criticism and self-criticism, clarify the correctness and superiority of New Democracy; at the same time, correct erroneous ideas and erroneous behaviors that violate the interests of the state and the people. Therefore, the following key points must be grasped in the study: (1) Clarify the spirit and essence of New Democracy, its differences from old democracy; and the meaning of the people's democratic dictatorship. (2) Recognize the definite status, future, and responsibilities of private industrialists and businessmen in New Democratic China; and recognize the duality of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, continue to overcome its backward and negative aspects, and fully develop its progressive and positive aspects, in order to further promote the enthusiasm for production and operation. (3) Deeply understand the great significance of the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and the relationship between the state's overall economic plan and the development of our private industry and commerce. Only in this way can normal public-private relations and labor-capital relations be established, and the policy of "both public and private benefit" and "both labor and capital benefit" be correctly implemented. (4) Promote the spirit of New Patriotism, unite international friends, and recognize the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation for safeguarding lasting world peace.
    Regarding the learning organization and learning methods, the notice decides that the Federations of Industry and Commerce (or preparatory committees) at all levels, under the unified leadership of the local consultation committee's study committee, may establish industrial and commercial study sub-committees to promote and group learning according to actual needs. Grouping methods can generally be based on regional grouping, while appropriately considering industry characteristics. If there is no study committee organizer in the local area, it should contact the local consultation committee (or the standing committee of the people's representative conference) to study the learning methods and steps, and formulate a learning plan. In addition to grading according to the level of proficiency, learning methods can also include holding study lecture meetings or study symposiums, adopting lectures or symposiums for learning.
    The Federations of Industry and Commerce (or preparatory committees) at all levels may consider the specific circumstances and set up learning guidance institutions or guidance personnel to help and promote learning; at the same time, other measures can be taken to cooperate with the work of the local study committee. In the learning process, attention should be paid to strengthening publicity, such as through publishing publications, or using big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, or organizing radio listening, etc., to cooperate with the development of the movement.
    The study of the Common Program is a relatively long-term one. In the learning process, this committee will, according to the spirit of the notice of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, arrange temporary studies on relevant policies, laws, and current affairs in stages according to specific circumstances. The Federations of Industry and Commerce (or preparatory committees) in various places must appropriately combine these two natures—temporary and relatively long-term learning.
    The notice requires all localities to report on the learning situation to this association at any time in order to summarize the experience of various places, leverage collective strength, and effectively improve learning.

    全国工商联筹备委员会向各级工商联发出通知
    要求全面推动工商业者学习共同纲领
    【新华社二十五日讯】为了有计划、有组织地全面推动工商界学习共同纲领，中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会于二十五日向各级工商联（或筹备会）发出关于工商界开展共同纲领的学习的通知。
    通知要求各级工商联（或筹备会）必须依照中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会“关于展开各界人士思想改造的学习运动的决定”和“关于领导各界人士进行共同纲领的学习的通知”，并根据全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议的决议，发动当地工商业者提高对学习的重视，自觉地参加这一伟大的学习运动，以求在认识上和行动上，全面与深入地掌握共同纲领的内容和精神，在“五反”运动胜利的基础上，进一步提高对政策的认识，以巩固“五反”运动的胜利，使工商业进一步获得健康的发展。
    通知指出：学习共同纲领必须联系实际，并结合自己的思想和业务，适当地展开批评与自我批评，明确新民主主义的正确性与优越性；同时并纠正违反国家和人民利益的错误思想和错误行为。因此，在学习中必须掌握下列几个要点：（1）明确新民主主义的精神和实质，它与旧民主主义的不同点；以及人民民主专政的意义。（2）认清私营工商业者在新民主主义中国的一定的地位、前途及其责任；并认识到中国民族资产阶级的两面性，继续克服其落后消极的一面，充分发挥其进步积极的一面，以求进一步发扬生产经营的积极性。（3）深切了解工人阶级和国营经济领导的重大意义，以及国家总的经济计划对我们私营工商业的发展的关系。必须如此，才能建立正常的公私关系和劳资关系，正确地贯彻“公私兼顾”和“劳资两利”的政策。（4）发扬新爱国主义精神，团结国际友人，认清中苏友好合作对保卫世界持久和平的重大意义。
    关于学习组织和学习方法，通知决定各级工商联（或筹备会），在当地协商委员会所属学习委员会的统一领导下，视实际的需要，得设立工商界学习分会，负责推动并分组学习。分组方法，一般可按地区分组，而适当地照顾行业性。如果当地尚无学习委员会组织者，应与当地协商委员会（或人民代表会议常务委员会）联系，研究学习办法与步骤，并订出学习计划。学习方法除按程度高低编级外，并可举办学习演讲会，或学习座谈会，采取听课或座谈方式，进行学习。
    各级工商联（或筹备会）得斟酌具体情况，设置学习辅导机构或辅导人员，帮助与推动学习；同时可采取其他各种措施，配合当地学习委员会工作。在学习过程中，应注意加强宣传，例如通过出版刊物，或利用大字报、黑板报、或组织收听广播等，以配合运动的展开。
    关于共同纲领的学习是比较长期性的。在学习过程中，本会将根据人民政协全国委员会的通知的精神，视具体情况分期布置有关政策、法令和时事等临时性的学习。各地工商联（或筹备会）必须适当地把这两种性质——临时性的与比较长期性的学习，妥善地结合起来。
    通知要求各地随时向该会汇报学习情况，以便总结各地经验，发挥集体力量，有效地改进学习。
