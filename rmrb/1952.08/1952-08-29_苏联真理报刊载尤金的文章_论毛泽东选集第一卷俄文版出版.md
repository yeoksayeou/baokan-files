　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 28th: "Pravda" published a lengthy article by Yudin on the 26th, discussing the recently published first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Russian in Moscow. Yudin wrote: "The publication of the collection of works by Comrade Mao Zedong, the outstanding leader of the Chinese people, is a major event not only for the Chinese Communist Party but also for the international communist movement. For more than 30 years, the Chinese Communist Party has led the Chinese people in the struggle to break free from the shackles of foreign imperialism and eliminate the oppression of feudal landlords. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is an event of world historical significance. After the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia and the victory of the Soviet Union in the Second World War, the victory of the Chinese Revolution is the most significant event in modern history, giving world imperialism, especially American imperialism, a new and irreparable blow. This victory once again most convincingly proves the invincible power of the Leninist thought that illuminates the victorious path of the great Chinese people." Yudin pointed out: "The Chinese Communist Party has accumulated rich experience in national liberation and anti-feudal struggle, which is an inspiring example for the communist parties and people of colonies and dependent countries in their liberation struggles."

　　Yudin gave a detailed introduction to the content and historical background of the first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Yudin wrote: "The works of Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, most completely and powerfully expound the history of the Chinese Communist Party and the history of the Chinese Revolution in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. In the process of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, the Chinese Communist Party has always put forward clear fighting slogans, and at every stage, it has given a correct assessment of the nature and development prospects of the Chinese Revolution. Mao Zedong's works are of particular interest to Marxists because he elucidates revolutionary experience from a Marxist-Leninist point of view. In the first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Strategic Problems in China's Revolutionary War" has enormous theoretical value. The last article in the first volume is Mao Zedong's philosophical work "On Practice." This work is well-known to our wide readership. "On Practice" proves that the Chinese Communist Party is nurtured in accordance with the philosophical principles of Marxism-Leninism. The revolutionary strategy and tactics of the Chinese Communist Party are formulated based on the laws of materialist dialectics applied to the specific circumstances of China."

　　Yudin concluded: "The first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is evidence of the great vitality of Marxist-Leninist thought. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party is resolutely fighting for the realization of Marxist-Leninist thought. The Chinese Communist Party has accepted Marxism-Leninism not dogmatically but creatively, and has successfully applied Marxist theory to China, thus greatly enriching Marxist theory. All fraternal communist parties, all fighters for peace, democracy, and socialism, will find many outstanding examples of heroic revolutionary wars in Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Many people will more deeply understand how irresistible historical laws are, and how the people guided by Marxist thought are opening the path to socialism. No matter how the imperialists of many countries, especially the American and British imperialists, try to obstruct the Chinese revolution with their intervention, they are weak and powerless, and have been driven out of China together with their lackeys – the despicable Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The Soviet people will study Mao Zedong's works with the greatest attention, and these works clearly embody the idea of the unbreakable friendship between the people of the two great countries. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is an indestructible force and guarantee for further consolidating the socialist camp and strengthening this camp's struggle for lasting peace, and for the freedom and equality of all peoples."

    苏联真理报刊载尤金的文章
　  论毛泽东选集第一卷俄文版出版
    【新华社莫斯科二十八日电】真理报二十六日刊载尤金一篇长文，论述不久前在莫斯科出版的俄文毛泽东选集第一卷。尤金写道：杰出的中国人民领袖毛泽东同志的文集的出版，不但对于中国共产党，而且对于国际共产主义运动，都是重大事件。中国共产党三十多年来领导着中国人民，进行摆脱外国帝国主义枷锁和消灭封建地主压迫的斗争。中国人民革命的胜利是有世界历史意义的事件。在苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命和苏联在第二次世界大战中取得胜利之后，中国革命的胜利是现代历史上最重大的事件，它使世界帝国主义首先是美帝国主义受到新的无法补救的打击。这个胜利再一次最令人信服地证明了照耀着伟大中国人民胜利道路的列宁主义思想无往不胜的力量。尤金指出：中国共产党累积了民族解放和反封建斗争的丰富经验，这种经验对于殖民地和附属国的共产党和人民说来，是鼓舞他们进行解放斗争的范例。
    尤金详细地介绍了毛泽东选集第一卷的内容和时代背景。尤金写道：中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛泽东的著作，最完全最有力地用马克思主义—列宁主义的精神阐明了中国共产党历史、中国革命历史。中国共产党在反帝反封建革命过程中经常提出明确的斗争口号，它在每一个阶段都给了中国革命性质和发展前途以正确的估计。毛泽东的著作特别使马克思主义者感到有兴趣，因为他用马克思主义—列宁主义的观点阐明革命经验。在毛泽东选集第一卷里面，“中国革命战争的战略问题”有着巨大的理论价值。第一卷中最后一篇是毛泽东的哲学著作“实践论”。这篇著作是我们广大读者所熟知的。“实践论”证明中国共产党是按照马克思主义—列宁主义的哲学原则教养起来的。中国共产党的革命战略和策略，都是根据运用到中国现实的具体情况中去的唯物辩证法法则制定出来的。
    尤金最后写道：毛泽东选集第一卷是马克思主义—列宁主义思想所具有的伟大活力的证据。中国共产党正在毛泽东领导下为马克思主义—列宁主义思想的实现而坚决斗争着。中国共产党不是教条地而是创造地接受了马克思主义—列宁主义，成功地把马克思主义的理论运用到中国去，因此大大地丰富了马克思主义的理论。一切兄弟共产党，一切拥护和平、民主和社会主义的斗士们，都会从毛泽东同志的著作中找到许多关于英勇的革命战争的卓越范例。许多人会更深刻地了解到历史法则是怎样不可违拗的，以马克思主义思想为指南的人民又是怎样打开走向社会主义之路的。不管许多国家的帝国主义者，特别是美英帝国主义者，怎样企图以他们的干涉来阻止中国的革命，但是他们是软弱无力的，而且是和他们的奴才——可鄙的蒋介石匪帮一起被赶出中国了。苏联人民将以最大的注意力研究毛泽东的著作，这些著作明确地体现着两大国人民牢不可破的友谊的思想。中苏人民的友谊是进一步巩固社会主义阵营并且加强这个阵营争取持久和平、争取各国人民自由和平等的斗争的不可摧毁的力量和保证。
