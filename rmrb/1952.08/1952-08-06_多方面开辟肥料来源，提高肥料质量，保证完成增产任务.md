    Develop Fertilizer Sources in Multiple Ways, Improve Fertilizer Quality, and Ensure the Completion of Production Increase Tasks
    This year, the amount of fertilizer accumulated and applied by farmers in our country has greatly increased compared to previous years. However, in terms of the current requirements for increased production, the amount of fertilizer already applied is still far from sufficient, and the quality is generally not high. The preparation of base fertilizer needed for autumn wheat planting and next year's spring plowing is also insufficient. In areas where the Patriotic Production Increase Movement is not well-developed, many farmers still have concerns about increasing fertilizer application, so naturally, they cannot accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. In areas where the Patriotic Production Increase Movement is better developed, farmers, responding to the call to increase yield per unit area, have used fertilizers as much as possible on the autumn fields, and there is a lack of base fertilizer for planting wheat in the autumn. Some people, in order to save base fertilizer for the wheat fields, are afraid to apply more top dressing fertilizer now. This problem of insufficient fertilizer urgently needs to be solved.
    Mobilize the Masses to Widely Carry Out the Fertilizer Accumulation Movement
    How can this problem be solved?
    Some people believe that farmers have already utilized their fertilizer to the "maximum" this spring. Bed soil and wall plaster that have not been changed for many years have been changed, and manure piles, pen bottoms, and toilets that have not been moved for many years have been dug up. In the clean-up campaign, decades of accumulated dust have been swept away, and there is no place to find more fertilizer. If more fertilizer is to be applied, the government must find a way to lend commercial fertilizer. Some cadres lack the spirit of actively overcoming difficulties, which further encourages the psychology of some farmers relying solely on the government.
    This idea that farmers have already utilized their fertilizer to the maximum is extremely harmful. The notice on carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on July 10 pointed out: "The existing commercial fertilizer, in terms of supply quantity and for improving soil fertility and soil structure, can only serve as supplementary fertilizer. Therefore, solving the problem of insufficient fertilizer for the vast number of farmers mainly depends on farm fertilizer; this huge potential force must be well-exploited and utilized."
    There are many sources of farm fertilizer. There are still many fertilizer resources that can be used that have not been fully utilized, waiting for us to develop them in a planned and led manner. Many areas, even relatively developed agricultural production areas like Pingyuan Province, still have many farm households without toilets, or with toilets but without pits. Many areas raise pigs without pens, or have pens but do not pay attention to regularly cleaning and bedding them. As long as these unreasonable situations are changed, a large amount of fertilizer can be added. Some areas advocated raising pigs this spring, but did not solve the problems of pig feed and sales well, causing some losses to the masses. The cadres responsible for this work have therefore taken a negative attitude towards raising pigs and do not actively try to solve the problems encountered, which has caused even greater losses to the masses. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government pointed out in the notice on carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement that "the most effective method of accumulating fertilizer at present is raising pigs, and the pig raising and fertilizer accumulation movement should be vigorously carried out." Relevant departments should actively assist farmers in solving the problems of pig feed sales and preventing swine fever, mobilize farmers to increase the number of pigs raised in a planned manner, and strengthen guidance on the methods of repairing pens and accumulating fertilizer.
    Cultivating green manure ("plowing under green manure") is a simple and highly effective fertilizer source. Some areas do not have the habit of cultivating green manure, and some areas, although they have the habit of cultivating green manure, are not accustomed to using leguminous plants as green manure, or the sowing is not dense enough. Correcting these shortcomings can greatly increase soil fertility. All localities should prepare green manure seeds for autumn sowing as soon as possible, and quickly plant beans to plow under as green manure on the land where wheat has been harvested but no other crops have been sown. It is also the most appropriate season for cutting grass to compost manure. Various weeds are growing vigorously and have not yet seeded, making them good materials for composting manure. Cutting weeds along the edges of fields and roads is also very beneficial for preventing insect pests. (When cutting grass for plowing under in mountainous areas, do not scrape off the grass along with the roots and soil on the hillside. Although this is good for accumulating fertilizer, it is very harmful to soil and water conservation and will cause long-term disasters.) In addition, areas near cities should make greater use of urban manure. Areas near lakes and rivers can pull aquatic plants and dig lake mud, and coastal areas can use inedible fish and shrimp skins to compost fertilizer. Many people discard large amounts of pig bones, sheep bones, and other animal bones, which is a great waste. If these things are collected, a large amount of bone meal can be made.
    Various fertilizer accumulation methods that the masses already have and have newly created should be promoted. The method of using Zaza bacteria to make fertilizer created by the Keshan Agricultural Experiment Station in Northeast China should be widely used. Farms in areas with suitable conditions should cultivate Zaza bacteria and widely promote this technology of cultivating bacteria to make manure.
    Overcome Conservative Thinking and Strengthen Technical Guidance
    Some farmers, especially farmers in areas with extensive cultivation, still believe that crops can grow without fertilizer. Farmers in these areas have just been liberated from the shackles of feudal forces, or are still being oppressed by feudal forces. They do not have the power or interest to improve the soil and increase soil fertility. Although most areas have already broken away from this state, many farmers are still unwilling to greatly increase the amount of fertilizer applied. This spring, some farmers believed that they used more base fertilizer than in previous years, so it didn't matter whether they applied top dressing fertilizer or not. Education should be carried out using examples of advanced farmers who have increased production by applying more fertilizer. Organizing farmer representatives to visit high-yield fields and inviting high-yield models to give reports are also good methods.
    A more common concern is that some farmers are afraid that applying too much fertilizer will "burn" the crops, cause the crops to grow "mad" (only grow leaves, not seeds), or make the crops easy to lodge. This concern is very common. These phenomena have indeed occurred in some places. This year, the wheat of Chen Xingbang, a "wheat lodging expert" from Shandong, and labor model LÃ¼ Hongbin lodged due to improper fertilization. This year, rice in many places in Hunan also lodged due to improper fertilization. This is because many production activists do not understand fertilization techniques and scientific knowledge, do not understand the principles of mixed fertilization and split application, and do not understand what kind of fertilizer is needed for what kind of crop. Therefore, the fertilizer used is large in quantity but improper. The most common situation is that there is too much nitrogen fertilizer and too little phosphate and potash fertilizer; some people apply unfermented soybean cake to the fields; some people blindly use large amounts of lime and gypsum; and some people think that multiple applications are too troublesome, so they apply all the fertilizer at once. These are the reasons why crops grow "mad" and lodge, and it is not because too much fertilizer is used. To solve this problem, technical guidance must be strengthened. State-owned farms and agricultural technology extension stations should strive to play a technical leadership role. All cadres who go to the countryside to work should learn some agricultural production techniques to guide the masses of farmers. Cadres of cooperatives who do fertilizer sales work should be familiar with the methods of fertilizer application and help farmers maximize the effectiveness of fertilizer.
    Improve Fertilizer Quality and Improve Fertilizer Accumulation Methods
    To completely solve the fertilizer problem, we should not only develop fertilizer sources and increase the quantity of fertilizer, but also pay attention to improving the quality of fertilizer. Cadres and farmers in many areas have now paid attention to increasing the amount of fertilizer applied, but have neglected the quality of fertilizer. Some fertilizers are mostly soil and little manure. Some fertilizers are not completely composted and cannot be absorbed by crops. Some fertilizers are also mixed with bacteria, insect eggs, and weed seeds. Some fertilizer is piled up in a bad way, allowing chickens and dogs to spoil it, and wind, sun, and rain to wash it away. As a result, the effectiveness of these fertilizers is lost by 20 to 60 percent. Some toilets and livestock pens are open-air and often do not have soil padding or covering. Manure left for ten days will lose 70 percent of its fertilizer effect. Some people do not know to store and place grass ash separately, but pour it into toilets and manure piles. This causes chemical changes between the grass ash and the manure, causing the ammonia fertilizer in the manure to turn into gas and volatilize, reducing the fertilizer effect. These situations show that fertilizer accumulation methods must be greatly improved. The Northeast region has paid attention to improving the method of accumulating and composting manure. The Northeast Region Fertilizer Work Conference held in June this year specifically proposed that attention should be paid to selecting manure piling locations and implementing a semi-underground type piling method (digging pits on the spot, building walls around them with soil, and sealing the top with mud), laying a layer of manure, padding a layer of soil, frequently turning and watering to promote fertilizer fermentation and decomposition. These methods are worth promoting universally. In terms of improving fertilizer quality, technical guidance needs to be strengthened in particular. The leadership must never be satisfied with the numbers of fertilizer accumulated, but must both advocate rationally applying more fertilizer and advocate using good fertilizer as much as possible.
    Commercial fertilizer can only be used as supplementary fertilizer for the time being. However, in order to change the habit of many farmers ignoring commercial fertilizer, we must strive to pave the way for commercial fertilizer and do a lot of hard work. Many farmers are still very skeptical about the effectiveness of commercial fertilizers, especially chemical fertilizers. Guo Yougen, a labor model from Shouchang, Zhejiang, even planned to throw the fertilizer powder awarded to him by the government into the river. He said, "Using this thing will ruin the fields." Some county and district cadres believe that promoting commercial fertilizer is not their job and does not count as "their achievements," so they do not pay attention to helping supply and marketing cooperatives promote commercial fertilizer. Some cooperative cadres also do not do hard sales work and technical guidance work, and sit and wait for customers to come to their door, leaving a lot of fertilizer stockpiled. These biases must be corrected. Cadres of some village joint cooperatives in Haiyang County, Shandong, seized the opportunity to apply top dressing fertilizer after the rain and peddled fertilizer door-to-door in the rain. As a result, the amount of fertilizer sold greatly increased, and the masses were very satisfied. This proactive spirit is worth learning for cooperative cadres everywhere.
    The Fertilizer Accumulation Movement is an Important Part of the Patriotic Production Increase Movement
    The importance of fertilizer in agricultural production should be fully recognized. We oppose the extremely absurd bourgeois "law of diminishing returns of land." We believe that with the progress of science and technology and changes in production methods, the fertility of the land can be continuously increased. To make the fertility of the land continuously grow, in addition to improving agricultural tools and using new-style agricultural tools and mechanical agricultural tools, it is also necessary to reasonably increase the application of fertilizer. Soviet agricultural expert Lysenko said in the article "Preliminary Results of the Application of Michurin Agricultural Biological Science in China" (see "China Agricultural Newspaper" No. 13, 1952): "The application of machines and fertilizers in agricultural production makes the output grow rapidly, much faster than the growth rate of labor investment per unit area." The high-yield experience of agricultural labor models in various parts of our country has proved that applying more fertilizer, applying good fertilizer, and applying fertilizer reasonably are the basic keys to increasing production. If the work of applying top dressing fertilizer is not done well, this year's production increase task will be greatly affected. If the fertilizer accumulation work is not done well, there will be no guarantee for the production increase of late rice, next year's wheat, and other crops.
    We should regard fertilizer accumulation work as a perennial task in agricultural production. Agricultural leading organs at all levels, every village, mutual aid group, and agricultural production cooperative, and every farm household should formulate practical and feasible annual fertilizer accumulation plans as far as possible based on specific conditions. In the past, the fertilizer accumulation plans in various places were mostly proposed at the same time as the winter and annual production plans. These plans were mostly formulated based on the estimated amount of fertilizer already available in that year, so the plans themselves had a great deal of blindness. The Northeast Region Fertilizer Work Conference held in June this year proposed a method of separating the annual fertilizer accumulation plan from the annual production plan. It is stipulated that the period from the spring plowing of each year should be regarded as the beginning of the next fertilizer accumulation year, correcting the method of proposing fertilizer accumulation and application plans at the same time as the production plan in autumn and winter in previous years. This method is correct. In order to implement the policy of perennial fertilizer accumulation and ensure the realization of the fertilizer accumulation plan, it is also necessary to strengthen specific leadership and guidance. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government pointed out in the notice on carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement:
    "To carry out fertilizer accumulation work, we must first strengthen organizational leadership, designate special personnel to be responsible at all levels, organize cadres to go deep into the countryside to widely publicize, conduct specific technical guidance, and mobilize farmers to formulate plans. Launch a fertilizer accumulation competition and pay attention to timely summing up and promoting good experiences." Party organizations at all levels should lead and help farmers implement these regulations in the Patriotic Production Increase Movement.
    The summer hoeing and weeding work in various places has ended one after another. In terms of temperature and weed growth, it is the best season for accumulating fertilizer. Areas that have already launched a perennial fertilizer accumulation movement should push the movement to a climax during this period. Areas that have not yet turned fertilizer accumulation work into a perennial movement should seize this opportunity, take mutual aid and cooperation organizations as the core, immediately launch a mass-based long-term fertilizer accumulation movement, and regard the fertilizer accumulation movement as an important part of the Patriotic Production Increase Competition. Doing a good job in the fertilizer accumulation movement enriches the content of the production increase competition movement and can enhance the confidence of the broad masses of farmers in striving for production increase.
