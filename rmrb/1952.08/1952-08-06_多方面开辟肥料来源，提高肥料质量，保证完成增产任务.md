    Develop Fertilizer Sources in Multiple Ways, Improve Fertilizer Quality, and Ensure the Completion of Production Increase Tasks
    This year, the amount of fertilizer accumulated and applied by farmers in our country has greatly increased compared to previous years. However, in terms of the current requirements for increased production, the amount of fertilizer already applied is still far from sufficient, and the quality is generally not high. The preparation of base fertilizer needed for autumn wheat planting and next year's spring plowing is also insufficient. In areas where the Patriotic Production Increase Movement is not well-developed, many farmers still have concerns about increasing fertilizer application, so naturally, they cannot accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. In areas where the Patriotic Production Increase Movement is better developed, farmers, responding to the call to increase yield per unit area, have used fertilizers as much as possible on the autumn fields, and there is a lack of base fertilizer for planting wheat in the autumn. Some people, in order to save base fertilizer for the wheat fields, are afraid to apply more top dressing fertilizer now. This problem of insufficient fertilizer urgently needs to be solved.
    Mobilize the Masses to Widely Carry Out the Fertilizer Accumulation Movement
    How can this problem be solved?
    Some people believe that farmers have already utilized their fertilizer to the "maximum" this spring. Bed soil and wall plaster that have not been changed for many years have been changed, and manure piles, pen bottoms, and toilets that have not been moved for many years have been dug up. In the clean-up campaign, decades of accumulated dust have been swept away, and there is no place to find more fertilizer. If more fertilizer is to be applied, the government must find a way to lend commercial fertilizer. Some cadres lack the spirit of actively overcoming difficulties, which further encourages the psychology of some farmers relying solely on the government.
    This idea that farmers have already utilized their fertilizer to the maximum is extremely harmful. The notice on carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on July 10 pointed out: "The existing commercial fertilizer, in terms of supply quantity and for improving soil fertility and soil structure, can only serve as supplementary fertilizer. Therefore, solving the problem of insufficient fertilizer for the vast number of farmers mainly depends on farm fertilizer; this huge potential force must be well-exploited and utilized."
    There are many sources of farm fertilizer. There are still many fertilizer resources that can be used that have not been fully utilized, waiting for us to develop them in a planned and led manner. Many areas, even relatively developed agricultural production areas like Pingyuan Province, still have many farm households without toilets, or with toilets but without pits. Many areas raise pigs without pens, or have pens but do not pay attention to regularly cleaning and bedding them. As long as these unreasonable situations are changed, a large amount of fertilizer can be added. Some areas advocated raising pigs this spring, but did not solve the problems of pig feed and sales well, causing some losses to the masses. The cadres responsible for this work have therefore taken a negative attitude towards raising pigs and do not actively try to solve the problems encountered, which has caused even greater losses to the masses. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government pointed out in the notice on carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement that "the most effective method of accumulating fertilizer at present is raising pigs, and the pig raising and fertilizer accumulation movement should be vigorously carried out." Relevant departments should actively assist farmers in solving the problems of pig feed sales and preventing swine fever, mobilize farmers to increase the number of pigs raised in a planned manner, and strengthen guidance on the methods of repairing pens and accumulating fertilizer.
    Cultivating green manure ("plowing under green manure") is a simple and highly effective fertilizer source. Some areas do not have the habit of cultivating green manure, and some areas, although they have the habit of cultivating green manure, are not accustomed to using leguminous plants as green manure, or the sowing is not dense enough. Correcting these shortcomings can greatly increase soil fertility. All localities should prepare green manure seeds for autumn sowing as soon as possible, and quickly plant beans to plow under as green manure on the land where wheat has been harvested but no other crops have been sown. It is also the most appropriate season for cutting grass to compost manure. Various weeds are growing vigorously and have not yet seeded, making them good materials for composting manure. Cutting weeds along the edges of fields and roads is also very beneficial for preventing insect pests. (When cutting grass for plowing under in mountainous areas, do not scrape off the grass along with the roots and soil on the hillside. Although this is good for accumulating fertilizer, it is very harmful to soil and water conservation and will cause long-term disasters.) In addition, areas near cities should make greater use of urban manure. Areas near lakes and rivers can pull aquatic plants and dig lake mud, and coastal areas can use inedible fish and shrimp skins to compost fertilizer. Many people discard large amounts of pig bones, sheep bones, and other animal bones, which is a great waste. If these things are collected, a large amount of bone meal can be made.
    Various fertilizer accumulation methods that the masses already have and have newly created should be promoted. The method of using Zaza bacteria to make fertilizer created by the Keshan Agricultural Experiment Station in Northeast China should be widely used. Farms in areas with suitable conditions should cultivate Zaza bacteria and widely promote this technology of cultivating bacteria to make manure.
    Overcome Conservative Thinking and Strengthen Technical Guidance
    Some farmers, especially farmers in areas with extensive cultivation, still believe that crops can grow without fertilizer. Farmers in these areas have just been liberated from the shackles of feudal forces, or are still being oppressed by feudal forces. They do not have the power or interest to improve the soil and increase soil fertility. Although most areas have already broken away from this state, many farmers are still unwilling to greatly increase the amount of fertilizer applied. This spring, some farmers believed that they used more base fertilizer than in previous years, so it didn't matter whether they applied top dressing fertilizer or not. Education should be carried out using examples of advanced farmers who have increased production by applying more fertilizer. Organizing farmer representatives to visit high-yield fields and inviting high-yield models to give reports are also good methods.
    A more common concern is that some farmers are afraid that applying too much fertilizer will "burn" the crops, cause the crops to grow "mad" (only grow leaves, not seeds), or make the crops easy to lodge. This concern is very common. These phenomena have indeed occurred in some places. This year, the wheat of Chen Xingbang, a "wheat lodging expert" from Shandong, and labor model Lü Hongbin lodged due to improper fertilization. This year, rice in many places in Hunan also lodged due to improper fertilization. This is because many production activists do not understand fertilization techniques and scientific knowledge, do not understand the principles of mixed fertilization and split application, and do not understand what kind of fertilizer is needed for what kind of crop. Therefore, the fertilizer used is large in quantity but improper. The most common situation is that there is too much nitrogen fertilizer and too little phosphate and potash fertilizer; some people apply unfermented soybean cake to the fields; some people blindly use large amounts of lime and gypsum; and some people think that multiple applications are too troublesome, so they apply all the fertilizer at once. These are the reasons why crops grow "mad" and lodge, and it is not because too much fertilizer is used. To solve this problem, technical guidance must be strengthened. State-owned farms and agricultural technology extension stations should strive to play a technical leadership role. All cadres who go to the countryside to work should learn some agricultural production techniques to guide the masses of farmers. Cadres of cooperatives who do fertilizer sales work should be familiar with the methods of fertilizer application and help farmers maximize the effectiveness of fertilizer.
    Improve Fertilizer Quality and Improve Fertilizer Accumulation Methods
    To completely solve the fertilizer problem, we should not only develop fertilizer sources and increase the quantity of fertilizer, but also pay attention to improving the quality of fertilizer. Cadres and farmers in many areas have now paid attention to increasing the amount of fertilizer applied, but have neglected the quality of fertilizer. Some fertilizers are mostly soil and little manure. Some fertilizers are not completely composted and cannot be absorbed by crops. Some fertilizers are also mixed with bacteria, insect eggs, and weed seeds. Some fertilizer is piled up in a bad way, allowing chickens and dogs to spoil it, and wind, sun, and rain to wash it away. As a result, the effectiveness of these fertilizers is lost by 20 to 60 percent. Some toilets and livestock pens are open-air and often do not have soil padding or covering. Manure left for ten days will lose 70 percent of its fertilizer effect. Some people do not know to store and place grass ash separately, but pour it into toilets and manure piles. This causes chemical changes between the grass ash and the manure, causing the ammonia fertilizer in the manure to turn into gas and volatilize, reducing the fertilizer effect. These situations show that fertilizer accumulation methods must be greatly improved. The Northeast region has paid attention to improving the method of accumulating and composting manure. The Northeast Region Fertilizer Work Conference held in June this year specifically proposed that attention should be paid to selecting manure piling locations and implementing a semi-underground type piling method (digging pits on the spot, building walls around them with soil, and sealing the top with mud), laying a layer of manure, padding a layer of soil, frequently turning and watering to promote fertilizer fermentation and decomposition. These methods are worth promoting universally. In terms of improving fertilizer quality, technical guidance needs to be strengthened in particular. The leadership must never be satisfied with the numbers of fertilizer accumulated, but must both advocate rationally applying more fertilizer and advocate using good fertilizer as much as possible.
    Commercial fertilizer can only be used as supplementary fertilizer for the time being. However, in order to change the habit of many farmers ignoring commercial fertilizer, we must strive to pave the way for commercial fertilizer and do a lot of hard work. Many farmers are still very skeptical about the effectiveness of commercial fertilizers, especially chemical fertilizers. Guo Yougen, a labor model from Shouchang, Zhejiang, even planned to throw the fertilizer powder awarded to him by the government into the river. He said, "Using this thing will ruin the fields." Some county and district cadres believe that promoting commercial fertilizer is not their job and does not count as "their achievements," so they do not pay attention to helping supply and marketing cooperatives promote commercial fertilizer. Some cooperative cadres also do not do hard sales work and technical guidance work, and sit and wait for customers to come to their door, leaving a lot of fertilizer stockpiled. These biases must be corrected. Cadres of some village joint cooperatives in Haiyang County, Shandong, seized the opportunity to apply top dressing fertilizer after the rain and peddled fertilizer door-to-door in the rain. As a result, the amount of fertilizer sold greatly increased, and the masses were very satisfied. This proactive spirit is worth learning for cooperative cadres everywhere.
    The Fertilizer Accumulation Movement is an Important Part of the Patriotic Production Increase Movement
    The importance of fertilizer in agricultural production should be fully recognized. We oppose the extremely absurd bourgeois "law of diminishing returns of land." We believe that with the progress of science and technology and changes in production methods, the fertility of the land can be continuously increased. To make the fertility of the land continuously grow, in addition to improving agricultural tools and using new-style agricultural tools and mechanical agricultural tools, it is also necessary to reasonably increase the application of fertilizer. Soviet agricultural expert Lysenko said in the article "Preliminary Results of the Application of Michurin Agricultural Biological Science in China" (see "China Agricultural Newspaper" No. 13, 1952): "The application of machines and fertilizers in agricultural production makes the output grow rapidly, much faster than the growth rate of labor investment per unit area." The high-yield experience of agricultural labor models in various parts of our country has proved that applying more fertilizer, applying good fertilizer, and applying fertilizer reasonably are the basic keys to increasing production. If the work of applying top dressing fertilizer is not done well, this year's production increase task will be greatly affected. If the fertilizer accumulation work is not done well, there will be no guarantee for the production increase of late rice, next year's wheat, and other crops.
    We should regard fertilizer accumulation work as a perennial task in agricultural production. Agricultural leading organs at all levels, every village, mutual aid group, and agricultural production cooperative, and every farm household should formulate practical and feasible annual fertilizer accumulation plans as far as possible based on specific conditions. In the past, the fertilizer accumulation plans in various places were mostly proposed at the same time as the winter and annual production plans. These plans were mostly formulated based on the estimated amount of fertilizer already available in that year, so the plans themselves had a great deal of blindness. The Northeast Region Fertilizer Work Conference held in June this year proposed a method of separating the annual fertilizer accumulation plan from the annual production plan. It is stipulated that the period from the spring plowing of each year should be regarded as the beginning of the next fertilizer accumulation year, correcting the method of proposing fertilizer accumulation and application plans at the same time as the production plan in autumn and winter in previous years. This method is correct. In order to implement the policy of perennial fertilizer accumulation and ensure the realization of the fertilizer accumulation plan, it is also necessary to strengthen specific leadership and guidance. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government pointed out in the notice on carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement:
    "To carry out fertilizer accumulation work, we must first strengthen organizational leadership, designate special personnel to be responsible at all levels, organize cadres to go deep into the countryside to widely publicize, conduct specific technical guidance, and mobilize farmers to formulate plans. Launch a fertilizer accumulation competition and pay attention to timely summing up and promoting good experiences." Party organizations at all levels should lead and help farmers implement these regulations in the Patriotic Production Increase Movement.
    The summer hoeing and weeding work in various places has ended one after another. In terms of temperature and weed growth, it is the best season for accumulating fertilizer. Areas that have already launched a perennial fertilizer accumulation movement should push the movement to a climax during this period. Areas that have not yet turned fertilizer accumulation work into a perennial movement should seize this opportunity, take mutual aid and cooperation organizations as the core, immediately launch a mass-based long-term fertilizer accumulation movement, and regard the fertilizer accumulation movement as an important part of the Patriotic Production Increase Competition. Doing a good job in the fertilizer accumulation movement enriches the content of the production increase competition movement and can enhance the confidence of the broad masses of farmers in striving for production increase.

    多方面开辟肥料来源，提高肥料质量，保证完成增产任务
    今年我国农民积肥施肥的数量，比往年大为增加了，但就当前的增产要求来说，已施的肥料的数量还很不够，质量一般也还不高，秋季种麦和明年春耕需要的基肥，准备的还很不够。在爱国增产运动开展得不好的地区，许多农民对于增施肥料还有顾虑，自然不可能大量增积肥料。在爱国增产运动开展得较好的地区，农民们响应提高单位面积产量的号召，已把肥料尽量地用到了秋田里，秋天种麦已缺乏基肥；而有些人为了要给麦田留基肥，现在不敢多上追肥。这个肥料不足的问题，迫切需要加以解决。
    发动农民群众广泛开展积肥运动
    怎样解决这个问题呢？
    有些人认为：今年春天农民的肥料已经利用“到顶”了，多年没有换的炕土、墙皮都换过了，多年没有动过的粪堆、圈底、厕所都挖过了。在清洁大扫除运动中，把几十年的积尘都打扫了，再也没有地方找更多的肥料了。如果还要增施肥料，只有请政府设法贷给商品肥料。有些干部缺乏积极地克服困难的精神，这就更加助长了一些农民单纯依靠政府的心理。
    这种认为农民的肥料已经利用到顶的想法是极为有害的。中央人民政府农业部七月十日发出的开展积肥运动的通知中已经指出：“现有商品肥料在供应数量上和对提高地力、改良土壤结构来说，只能充作补助肥料。因此解决广大农民肥料不足的问题，主要是依靠农家肥料；必须很好地发掘和发挥这个巨大的潜在力量。”
    农家肥料的来源是很多的。现在还有许多可作肥料的富源没有被充分利用，等待着我们有计划有领导地加以开发。许多地区，甚至像平原省这样农业生产比较发达的地区，也还有很多农家没有厕所，或者有厕所而没有坑。许多地区养猪而没有圈，或者有圈而不注意经常起圈垫圈。只要把这种不合理的情况加以改变，就可以增加大量的肥料。有些地区曾在今春提倡养猪，但没有很好地解决猪的饲料和销路问题，使群众受了一些损失，负责这种工作的干部，因此对养猪这件事采取了消极的态度，不去积极设法解决碰到的问题，这就使群众受了更大的损失。中央农业部在关于开展积肥运动的通知中指出“目前积肥最有效的方法就是养猪，应该大力开展养猪积肥运动”。有关部门应当积极协助农民解决猪的饲料销路和防治猪瘟等问题，发动农民有计划地增加养猪的数量，并在修圈积肥的方法上加强指导。
    栽培绿肥（“压青”）是一个方法简单而效力很大的肥源。有些地区还没有栽培绿肥的习惯，有些地区虽有栽培绿肥的习惯，但不习惯用豆科植物作绿肥，或者播种不够稠密。改正了这些缺点，就可以大大增加地力。各地目前应该及早准备秋季播种的绿肥种籽，在小麦已经收割但未播种其他作物的土地上，赶紧种豆压青。目前也是割草沤粪的最适当的季节。各种杂草长得正旺，又还没有结籽，正是沤粪的好材料。割去地边路边的杂草，对于防治虫害也有很大好处。（山区割草压青时，不可把山坡上的草连根带土刮掉，这样对于积肥虽有好处，对于水土保持却有很大害处，将会造成长远的灾患。）此外，城市附近地区应该更多地利用城粪。滨湖靠河地区，可以扯水草、挖湖泥，滨海地区可以利用不能吃的鱼类和虾皮沤肥料。许多人把大量的猪骨羊骨和其他兽骨抛弃了，这是一项很大的浪费；如果把这些东西搜集起来，可以制成大量的骨粉。
    群众已有的和新创造的各种积肥方法，都应该加以推广。东北克山农业试验场创造的用扎扎菌造肥料的方法，应该广泛地加以利用，有条件的地区的农场，都应培制扎扎菌，并广泛地推广这种培菌造粪的技术。
    克服保守思想，加强技术指导
    有些农民，特别是耕作粗放地区的农民，还认为土地不上粪，也可以长庄稼。这些地区的农民刚解脱封建势力的束缚，或者还在受着封建势力的压迫，他们还没有力量或没有兴趣改良土壤，增进地力。绝大部分地区虽然已经脱离了这种状态，但很多农民还是不愿意大量增加施肥的数量。今春有些农民认为用的基肥比往年多了，施不施追肥不要紧了。应该用先进的农民多施肥料增加产量的实例，进行教育。组织农民代表到丰产田里参观，请丰产模范作报告，也是很好的方法。
    更普遍的一种思想顾虑是有些农民害怕多施肥料，会把庄稼“烧坏”，会使庄稼长“疯”（只长叶子，不结籽），或使庄稼容易倒伏。这种思想顾虑是很普遍的。有的地方确实发生过这些现象。今年山东“窝麦能手”陈兴邦、劳动模范吕鸿宾的麦子，都因施肥不当而倒伏了；今年湖南不少地方的稻子，也因施肥不当而倒伏了。这是因为，许多生产积极分子不懂得施肥的技术和科学知识，不懂得混合施肥、分期施肥的道理，不懂得那种作物需要那种肥料。因此，用的肥料多而不当。最普遍的情况是用氨肥多而用磷肥、钾肥太少；有人把没有发酵的豆饼上到地里；有人盲目地大量地使用石灰、石膏；有人嫌多次施肥太麻烦，就一次把肥料全部用上。这是庄稼长“疯”、倒伏的原因，而不在于肥料用得太多。为了解决这个问题，必须加强技术指导。国营农场、农业技术推广站要努力发挥技术领导作用；凡是到农村做工作的干部，都应该学会一些农业生产技术，以便指导农民群众。合作社做推销肥料工作的干部，更要熟悉肥料的施用方法，帮助农民发挥肥料的最大的效力。
    提高肥料质量，改进积肥方法
    为了完满地解决肥料问题，不只应该开辟肥源，增加肥料的数量，还必须注意提高肥料的质量。许多地区的干部和农民，现在已经注意了增加施肥的数量，但是忽略了肥料的质量。有些肥料是土多粪少。有些肥料没有完全沤透，不能为庄稼吸收。有些肥料还混有病菌、虫卵、草籽。有些肥料堆积方法不好，任凭鸡狗糟蹋，风吹日晒，雨水冲洗，结果，这些粪肥的效力损失了百分之二十到六十。有些厕所、畜圈是露天的，常常又不垫土盖土；粪便放置十天，便会损失肥效百分之七十。有些人不知道把草木灰单存单放，而倒在厕所里和粪堆上；这样就使草木灰和粪便发生化学变化，使粪里的氨肥变成气体挥发出去，降低了肥效。这些情况说明，积肥的方法必须大加改善。东北区已经注意改进积蓄堆肥的方法。今年六月间举行的东北区肥料工作会议，特别提出，要注意选择堆粪地点，并实行半地下型堆积法（就地挖坑，周围用土打墙，用泥土封住上面），铺一层粪，垫一层土，勤翻勤浇水，促进肥料发酵腐熟。这些办法是值得普遍推广的。在提高肥料质量方面，特别需要加强技术指导。领导方面决不可单纯满足积肥数字，既要提倡合理地多施肥料，又要提倡尽可能地施用好的肥料。
    商品肥料目前还只能当作补助肥料。但是，为了改变许多农民忽视商品肥料的习惯，我们必须努力为商品肥料开辟道路，要作许多艰苦的工作。许多农民对商品肥料，特别是对化学肥料的效用还很怀疑。浙江寿昌劳动模范郭有根竟打算把政府奖给他的肥田粉丢到河里，他说：“用这种玩意儿会把田弄坏的。”有些县区干部认为推销商品肥料不是自己的工作，不算“自己的成绩”，就不注意帮助供销合作社推广商品肥料。有些合作社干部也不作艰苦的推销工作和技术指导工作，坐等顾客上门，把不少肥料积压了下来。这些偏向必须加以纠正。山东海阳县某些村联合社干部抓紧了雨后要施追肥的时机，冒雨挨户兜售肥料，结果，售肥数量大为增加，群众都很满意。这种积极主动的精神是值得各地合作社干部学习的。
    积肥运动是爱国增产运动的重要组成部分
    应当充分认识肥料在农业生产中的重要性。我们反对资产阶级的极端荒谬的“土地报酬递减率”，我们认为，随着科学技术的进步，生产方法的改变，土地的肥力是可以不断增加的。要使土地肥力不断增长起来，除了改进农具、使用新式农具和机械农具之外，还必须合理地增施肥料。苏联农学专家卢森科在“米邱林农业生物科学在中国应用的初步成果”一文（见“中国农报”一九五二年第十三期）中说：“在农业生产上应用机器和肥料使产量迅速增长，要比单位面积上劳力的投资增长的速度迅速得多。”我国各地农业劳动模范的丰产经验，都证明了多施肥、施好肥和合理施肥是增加产量的基本关键。不做好施用追肥的工作，今年的增产任务将受极大的影响；不做好积肥工作，今年的晚稻、明年的小麦等作物的增产就没有保证。
    我们应当把积肥工作当做农业生产中的常年工作。各级农业领导机关，每个农村、互助组和农业生产合作社以及每家农户，应当根据具体条件，尽可能地订出切实可行的常年积肥计划。过去各地的积肥计划，大都是在冬季和一年的生产计划同时提出的。这种计划多是根据当年已有的肥料估计订出的，因此计划本身带有很大盲目性。今年六月召开的东北区肥料工作会议，提出了把积肥年度计划和生产年度计划分开的办法。规定自每年春耕时起，作为下一个积肥年度开始的时期，纠正了历年到秋冬时和生产计划同时提出积肥施肥计划的办法。这个办法是正确的。为了贯彻常年积肥的方针，保证积肥计划的实现，还必须加强具体的领导和指导。中央农业部在关于开展积肥运动的通知中指出：
    “开展积肥工作，首先应该加强组织领导，逐级指定专人负责，组织干部深入农村广泛宣传，具体进行技术指导，发动农民订出计划。展开积肥竞赛并要注意及时总结和推广好的经验。”各级党的组织应当在爱国增产运动中，领导帮助农民实现这些规定。
    各地的夏锄和薅秧工作已陆续结束，就气温和杂草生长情况来说，正是积肥的最好的季节。已经开展了常年积肥运动的地区，应在这个时期把运动推向高潮；还没有把积肥工作变成常年运动的地区，应该抓紧这个时机，以互助合作组织为核心，立即把群众性的长期的积肥运动开展起来，并把积肥运动作为爱国增产竞赛的一个重要部分。积肥运动开展得好，就充实了增产竞赛运动的内容，就可以提高广大农民群众争取增产的信心。
