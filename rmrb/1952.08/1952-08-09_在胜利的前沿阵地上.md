    On the Front Lines of Victory
    Han Zi
    This time, I followed the division commander to the front lines, winding through communication trenches over mountains and ridges. More than half of this curving, long trench was hewn from solid rock; even the earthen trenches had been hardened like iron by the footsteps of thousands of soldiers. We passed through two relatively long sections facing the enemy and blockaded by enemy artillery fire. The surroundings were densely dotted with shell craters, with scattered gravel on the trench tops. We even picked up two freshly made shell fragments inside the trench. Every day, hundreds to thousands of shells were falling on this position, but thanks to the soldiers' daily repairs, the entire trench rarely collapsed. The division commander, walking ahead, kept saying, "Look, this is our soldiers' work." He tapped the sides with his stick, a smile on his face in the solid echo. I was also deeply moved, feeling that I was walking the heroic path to the front lines. At every intersection, the soldiers marked with wooden signs: "Victory Road," "Advance Road." These were truly fitting names.
    Along the way, we could find the soldiers' "homes"—tunnels that burrowed deep into the mountains, and small stone houses. Most of them were hidden, with rain cloths or cotton door curtains hanging at the entrances. Peering inside, you could see soldiers on duty, guarding their posts. Some were line protection teams, others were manning telephone extensions. ... At the sunlit entrances, the soldiers' young, rosy faces were visible as they focused on their textbooks and picture books. Everywhere, we could hear the sound of stone-cutting. These soldier-stonemasons were engaged in tireless labor. Sometimes, a heavy sound like artillery fire would boom, which was the sound of them blasting through stubborn rocks. Although the explosives still emitted a pungent, bitter smell, the victorious battle was advancing the engineering work. The division commander visited each of these soldiers' homes, the completed and uncompleted tunnels, firing points, artillery positions, ammunition depots..., not missing a single place where he could set foot. He groped his way inside, either standing straight or bending over, trying to see the surroundings in the darkness, studying their positions, directions, exits, depths, and the degree of solidity, as well as their tactical significance, etc., expressing his opinions of praise and criticism. We stayed for a long time in a tunnel of a certain company. In the light of an oil lamp, the political instructor pointed to the neat stone walls and told us that this was the most solid bluestone. This very long tunnel was completed by six soldiers who worked fourteen hours a day, day and night, for sixty-one days. They used less than ten kilograms of explosives, stubbornly carving it out inch by inch. After completion, seven pickaxes were worn down to three or four inches in length, and a meter-long drill became a dozen centimeters, and the hammer became a ball. We listened silently, as if we could see the sweating soldiers still swinging their strong arms here. It was these warriors who opened up all the mountains and built their steel positions. I had heard that they liked the story of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains. In fact, these people who admired the Foolish Old Man had created even more brilliant achievements than the Foolish Old Man himself. The division commander stroked the stone wall quietly and said:
    "This doesn't look like it was carved by hand, it looks like it was cut by a machine. It shows the soldiers' strong will, which is also the will to fight. A soldier who has made a tunnel must also improve his thinking by one step." But I did not hear him say this praise to the soldiers who were working. On the position of a certain company with relatively strong fortifications, he still seriously and sincerely instructed the political instructor:
    "I always hope you don't be proud. Although you shake your head and say:
    'We are not proud.' But I don't listen to what you say, I only look at your fortifications. If the fortifications do not meet the standards, it shows that you are proud. In order to deal with the ferocious American imperialism, we have to study and repair our fortifications every day. It doesn't matter if the soldiers are a little tired at ordinary times, this is to protect them, and it is really being responsible to the people and soldiers." I also heard him tell this opinion to the Party committee of this regiment that had just won a battle, believing that pride and complacency are a manifestation of low ideological level, and that only by striving for perfection can we effectively deal with the enemy.
    The most moving thing on this position is still the soldiers' fighting and life.
    Enemy planes were screaming overhead in batches, answered by the fierce firing of anti-aircraft weapons. The soldiers competed to tell us about the embarrassing appearance of these "bad guys" catching fire and crashing. In the continuous explosions of bombs and shells, I did not see a single panicked soldier; several cave entrances were transmitting the sound of gongs and drums and talking fast board. The admirable sentries were fearlessly monitoring the enemy. Where we passed, they all came over to salute and warmly told us to do a good job of camouflage: wear masks and not expose ourselves outside the communication trenches. I saw that the division commander listened to them very much. He immediately made a camouflage hat next to a sentry, as if telling me: Obeying the soldiers' discipline has the most sublime significance. There were also soldiers pulling small carts filled with gravel from the tunnel entrances. They also stood at attention and saluted the division commander. The division commander was busy making way and expressing his condolences to them. They were all smiling and extremely happy. I asked
    a soldier named Xiao Haiqing, who was full of sweat: "Are you tired?" An unexpected answer was: "I was born in a poor peasant family." This time, the division commander laughed loudly. We savored this soldier's honest answer for a long time.
    We had been to two artillery positions. In this place where several bombs and 10,000 shells had fallen, our artillery had not stopped firing at the enemy for a single day. They were the powerful guardians of the entire position; and they had cleared the way for the attacking troops several times. Just the day before, a mountain gun had hit five out of five targets, annihilating more than sixty enemies who were throwing grenades at friendly troops. The division commander told them the news that the friendly troops had come to report their meritorious service. A gun at the very front severely restricted the enemy's freedom of action, and had already hit more than 300 enemies. Gunners Li Haiquan and Zhuang Yuezhong effectively suppressed the enemy in several coordinated counterattacks and were awarded second-class merit. At our temporary meeting, they also reported their meritorious deeds. I pinned Mao Zedong badges on them and gave five colored portraits of the leader to the entire company, and the soldiers immediately passed them around to look at. I knew that there was no need for many words here, only sincerely wishing them: "In front of Chairman Mao, your artillery will definitely fire better." The division commander said to me:
    "Their artillery here has really fed the enemy."
    We had also seen the enemy's positions and even the enemy's activities several times through the firing ports and artillery observation mirrors. I saw the division commander observing very carefully, as if studying bacteria under a microscope. He was trying his best to find out their original form in disguise, with a thoughtful expression on his face. This was the most real face of a commander. Being able to see the enemy was very exciting to me. I felt that the most ferocious enemy in the world was in front of us, and our artillery muzzle was also aimed at them. I personally saw our shells exploding on the enemy's positions. Our comrades in the front-line group had never allowed the enemy to cross their positions; the section of the position at the very front had been captured in several outstanding counterattacks in the past six months. They stood menacingly in front of the enemy.
    I also want to talk about the soldiers' lives. I feel that the creative power of life is active everywhere. Red flowers and green leaves in shell casings at stone cave entrances or window openings are often fresh. It is said that in spring, the surroundings of the houses are simply decorated like a garden. Pine branches are also tied into arches and railings, forever like a festival. Brooms made of branches diligently serve the people every day; even the communication trenches are swept clean. The toilet is a hundred meters away and also has its hidden part. The troops launched a warm fly-killing, rat-catching, cleaning and hygiene campaign, and hygiene conventions were posted in the kitchen and living rooms. In the soldiers' small houses, all kinds of self-made utensils and daily necessities are placed in an orderly manner, with bottles and cans, wooden cabinets and iron boxes, everything available. There are also portraits of leaders and pictures in the rooms. Every class has a small stove for boiling water. Even if they have to carry water from the bottom of the mountain through the blockade, their water tanks are always full. It is said that they also often use gasoline barrels to make bath pools and take baths.
    The young new soldiers from the south have not only grown taller in the past year, but many have become stronger. They climb mountains, carry wood, walk, run and jump together, each like a dragon and a tiger. The division commander squinted his eyes and looked at them, fully showing his inner love. We sat on a clean bed in a class for a long time, carefully looking at the united and friendly life of this class and their healthy faces. The division commander praised the squad leader and told him the responsibility of the squad leader:
    "The motherland and their parents have handed over these young lads to you, you must be responsible for them, like their mother. Being a squad leader is not only to lead them to fight, but also to make them healthy and lively, without any sick people. Although we are on the position, we are not like the enemy's troops who are always worried about being beaten and panicking all day long. In addition to combat readiness, we can do our best to make life better here and make everything clean and hygienic." He also repeatedly told them to dry their quilts and spread grass, pay attention to diet, and at the same time assured them that comrades in the rear will send them green vegetables and save white flour to send to the front.
    Some soldiers were eating, so we went in to take a look. They had enough rice and flour and non-staple food, half coarse and half fine grains, with bean sprouts, tofu, and plenty of oil in the basin. We ate dumplings, steamed buns, pancakes, noodles, fried dough twists, etc., the same as the soldiers.
    The life in front of us aroused many memories for the division commander and the soldiers.
    How fast the changes have been in a year. Compared with the days of a handful of fried noodles and a mouthful of snow, sleeping on oilcloth and sheltering from the wind and rain, it is really two kinds of life; but both kinds of life are for victory. The soldiers did not complain about the hardships of those days, but believed that going through such hardships had well-trained themselves. They used their labor to improve their lives. They also repeatedly said that they wanted to thank the support of the people of the motherland and the efforts of the transportation personnel. Without the supply of materials, it would be impossible to improve their lives.
    We did not return the same way at night, but passed through a slope along a cliff. Although we had been walking on the position for thirteen hours, our steps were still light. The pine forest seemed to cheer and welcome us. It was a truly pleasant day. The division commander said in front:
    "The position has improved, the soldiers' bodies have become stronger, combat and work are improving, and the strongest are the soldiers' perseverance and their discipline. It seems that as long as the superiors give any task or suggest any method, they will do it no matter what. The determination of our commanders is based on these, with such soldiers, how can we not win!" This seemed to be his conclusion after inspecting the position today.

    在胜利的前沿阵地上
    菡子
    这次我随着师长去前沿阵地，顺着交通沟翻山过岭。这弯曲的长沟，一半以上是从山石中劈出来的；就是那些土沟也已由万千个战士的脚步，踏成硬铁一般。我们经过两段较长的、面对敌人而为敌炮所封锁的地方，四周密布着弹坑，沟顶有碎石散落着，甚至就在沟内我们还拣到两块最新的弹片。每天，在这阵地上，正落着数百发至数千发炮弹，但整个壕沟，由于战士们每天的修补，还是很少倒塌的地方。师长在前面连连地说：“你看看，这就是我们战士的劳作。”他用棍子向两旁敲着，在坚实的回声里露着微笑。我也很感动，自己正走着英雄的通向前沿的道路。战士们在每个路口用木牌标着：“胜利路”、“前进路”。这原是相称的命名。
    沿途都可以找到战士的“家”，有转弯抹角深入山肚的坑道，有小小的石屋。它们大都是隐蔽的，门上垂着雨布或棉门帘，探身进去，可以看见值班的战士正严守着自己的岗位，有的是护线组，有的是电话分机。……在晒着阳光的洞口，露着战士们年青红润的脸，正注视手中的课本和画册。到处还听见打石的响声，这些战士兼石匠正进行着不疲倦的劳动。有时传出炮击似的重音，这是他们炸开顽石的突破口的声音。虽然炸药还吐散着呛人的苦味，但胜利的战斗却把工程向前引进了。师长一一访问了这些战士的家、完成和未完成的坑道、火力点、炮位、弹库……，没有漏掉一个可以插足的地方，他直着或弯着身子摸索进去，尽量在黑暗中探视四周，研究它们的位置、方向、出口、纵深和坚实的程度以及在战术上的意义等等，说出自己赞赏和批评的意见。我们在某连的一条坑道里待了好一会，在油灯的光芒下，指导员指着整齐的石壁告诉我们，这是最坚实的青石，这一条很长的坑道，是由六个战士，每天不分昼夜工作十四小时，在六十一天中完成的；他们用了不到十公斤的炸药，硬是一分一厘地劈出来的。完工以后，有七把洋镐磨成三、四分长，一公尺多长的钎子变成十几公分了，锤子也变成一个球了。我们默默地听着，仿佛看见流着汗的战士还在这里挥动着他们健壮的臂膀。就是这些勇士，辟开了所有的山肚，建设了自己的钢铁阵地。我曾听说他们喜欢愚公移山的故事，其实这些敬仰愚公的人们，自己就创造了比愚公更辉煌的业绩。师长抚摸着石壁静静地说：
    “这那里像是手工劈出来的，简直像机器削的。在这里显出我们战士刚强的意志，也就是战斗的意志，一个战士做过一道坑道，他的思想一定也提高一步。”可是我没有听见他把这个夸奖，说给正在劳作的战士们听，就在工事较强的某连阵地上，他还严肃诚恳地嘱咐指导员：
    “我永远希望你们不要骄傲。虽然你摇着头说：
    ‘我们不骄傲。’可是我不听你嘴里怎么说，我只看你们的工事，工事不合标准，就说明你们在骄傲。为了对付凶恶的美帝国主义，我们每天都得研究和加修我们的工事，平时让战士们劳苦一点不要紧，这就是对他们的爱护，也真正是对人民和战士负责。”我还听见他把这意见告诉这个刚打过胜仗的团的党委，认为骄傲自满是思想水平低的表现，精益求精，才能有效地对付敌人。
    在这阵地上最动人的还是战士的战斗和生活。
    敌机成批地在头上叫，回答它们的是高射武器的激烈的射击。战士们争着告诉我们这些“坏蛋”着火降落的狼狈模样。在连续的炸弹和炮弹的爆炸声中，我没有看见一个惊慌失措的战士；有好几个洞
    口却正传出锣鼓的响声和说快板的声音。令人起敬的岗哨，正在无畏地监视着敌人。在我们路过的地方，他们都过来敬礼，满怀热情地关照我们搞好伪装：带上口罩，不暴露在交通沟外。我看出师长很听他们的话，他有一次立刻在岗哨旁边做了个伪装帽，仿佛告诉我：遵守战士的纪律，有最崇高的意义。还有战士拉着装满碎石的小车正从坑道口出来，他们也给师长立正敬礼，师长忙着让路，并向他们表示慰问，他们都笑着，高兴极了。我问了
    一个满面大汗名叫萧海清的战士：“你累不累？”一句出乎意外的答语是：“我是贫农出身。”这次师长朗声笑了。我们很久地回味着这个战士诚实的回答。
    我们到过两个炮兵阵地。在这落了几处炸弹和一万发炮弹的地方，我们的炮没有一天停止过对敌人的射击。他们是整个阵地有力的守卫者；并几次为出击的部队开了路。就在前天，一门山炮曾五发五中，歼灭正向友军投掷手榴弹的六十几个敌人，师长把友军前来报功的消息告诉了他们。在最前沿的一门炮，严厉地不让敌人有行动自由，已经击中敌人三百余名。炮手李海泉、庄岳忠在几次配合反击中有效地制压了敌人，立了二等功。在我们临时举行的会议上，他们还报告了立功事迹。我给他们戴上毛主席纪念章，还把五张彩色的领袖像送给全连，战士们马上一一传过去看。我知道在这里用不着很多的言辞，只挚诚地预祝他们：“在毛主席面前，你们的炮一定打得更好。”师长对我说：
    “他们这里的炮，可真是喂饱了敌人。”
    我们还几次在射口和炮兵观察镜里看见敌人的阵地甚至敌人的活动。我看见师长十分仔细地观察着，好像从显微镜中研究细菌似的。他在竭力弄清它们在伪装中的原形，脸上显现着富有思想的表情，这是一个指挥员最真实的面容。能够看到敌人，在我可是很激动的，我感觉着：前面就是世界上最凶恶的敌人，而我们的炮口也正对着他们。我亲眼看见我们的炮弹正在敌人的阵地上爆炸。我们前沿小组的同志也从来没有让敌人越过自己的位置；在最前面的一段阵地，就是在这半年中经过几次出色的反击战夺过来的。它们是那样虎视耽耽地兀立在敌人的前面。
    还想说一说战士们的生活。我觉得在任何地方都活跃着生命的创造力。石洞口或窗户口，用炮弹壳装着的红花绿叶，经常是新鲜的，据说在春天，住屋四周简直打扮得像个花园。松枝也被扎成牌楼、扶栏，永远像节日一样。用树枝扎成的扫把，每天勤劳地为人们服务；就是那些交通沟里也扫得干干净净。厕所在百公尺以外，也有它的隐蔽部。部队展开了热烈的灭蝇捕鼠清洁卫生运动，伙房和住室里都贴着卫生公约。在战士们的小屋里各种自制的用具和日常用品都放得井井有条，瓶瓶罐罐，木橱铁箱，应有尽有。房里还有领袖像和画片。每一班都有烧水的小灶，即使要通过封锁网从山底背上水来，他们的水缸也总是满满的，据说他们还经常用汽油筒做澡池，洗澡。
    南方来的年轻新战士在这一年多来不但长高了个子，很多都变得更结实了。他们在一起比爬山，比扛木头，走路跑着跳着，个个生龙活虎似的。师长眯着眼睛望着他们，充分显出内心的喜爱。我们在一个班干净的床铺上坐了好久，仔细看着这一班人团结友爱的生活和他们健康的脸孔。师长夸奖了班长，并告诉他班长的责任：
    “祖国和他们的父母把这些年青小伙子交给你了，你就得对他们负责，像他们的母亲一样。当班长的不仅要带他们打仗，还要使他们健康活泼，没有病号。虽说我们在阵地上，但我们不是敌人那样老愁挨揍、成天慌慌张张的部队，除了战斗准备，我们尽可以在这里把生活搞得好些，把一切弄得清洁卫生。”他还再三关照他们要晒被子和铺草，注意饮食，同时向他们保证，在后方的同志将给他们送青菜，并节约白面送给前方。
    有战士在吃饭，我们就钻进去看看，他们有足够的米面和副食，粗细粮各半，有豆芽，豆腐，盆里油水也不少。我们吃到的就有饺子、馒头、烙饼、面条、油果子等等，战士们和我们吃的一样。
    这眼前的生活，引起师长和战士们的许多回忆。
    一年的变化多快，比起一把炒面一口雪，身垫油布头顶风雨的日子，真是两种生活；但这两种生活都是为了胜利。战士们没有埋怨那些日子的艰苦，倒是认为经过那样的艰苦，很好地锻炼了自己。他们用自己的劳动来改善自己的生活。他们还再三说要谢谢祖国人民的支援和运输人员的努力，没有物质的供应，要想改善生活也是不可能的。
    晚上没有照原路回来，我们沿着一道绝壁通过斜坡。虽说已在阵地上走了十三小时，我们的脚步还是轻快的，松林也似乎欢呼迎接我们，这真是愉快的一天。师长在前面说：
    “阵地进步了，战士的身体壮了，战斗和工作都在提高，最强的是战士的毅力和他们的纪律性，看上去，只要上面交什么任务，提什么办法，他们怎么也得办到。我们指挥员的决心就是根据这些来的，有这样的战士哪有不打胜仗的！”这似乎是他今天视察阵地的结论。
