    Recreational Activities Liven Up Military Life
    Editor: Our base transit station used to perform very poorly in terms of recreational activities. For example, during the afternoon activity time, apart from a few people playing basketball, there were no other activities. The Saturday evening parties were also similarly unsuccessful, with most comrades not participating; I was one of them. The main reason was a failure to appreciate the important significance of these activities. As a result, our place was lifeless day in and day out.
    Since we read in the newspaper the inscriptions by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu calling for the development of sports and the strengthening of the people's physique, and Comrade Xiao Hua's article calling for vigorous development of military cultural activities, we have paid attention to recreational activities. The leaders personally participated in volleyball, basketball and other activities. What particularly moved the comrades was that our Station Master Xie, who is over fifty years old, also learned to dance group dances with the comrades, which greatly encouraged the comrades below. Some comrades who did not like to participate in activities also automatically joined in.
    Now, the vast majority of comrades in our station participate in recreational activities, and people have become more lively. We have deeply realized the great significance of recreational activities in enhancing physical strength and regulating the spirit.

    文娱活动使部队生活活跃起来了
    编辑同志：我们基地转运站过去在文娱活动方面作得很差。比如每天下午的活动时间，除了少数几个人玩玩篮球外，就没有别的活动。星期六的晚会，也同样搞不起来，大部分同志都不参加，我就是其中的一个。主要原因是没有体会到这些活动的重要意义，因此我们那里一天到晚都是死气沉沉的。
    自从我们看到报纸上毛主席、朱总司令亲笔题字要开展体育运动，增强人民体质，和萧华同志号召大力开展部队文艺活动的文章后，我们对文娱活动注意了。首长们亲自参加了排球、篮球等活动。特别使同志们受感动的，是我们的谢站长五十多岁了，也和同志们在一块学跳集体舞，这对下面同志有很大的鼓舞。一些不爱参加活动的同志，也自动地参加了。
    现在，我们站上绝大多数的同志，参加了文娱活动，人也变得活泼了。我们已深深体会到文娱活动对增强体力、调剂精神的重大意义。
