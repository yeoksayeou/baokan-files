Report on Work in North China and Several Major Tasks for the Future
(Report delivered at the First Plenary Session of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council on August 15, 1952)
Liu Lantao, Director of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council

In the first half of this year, leadership organs above the county level throughout the region concentrated their main efforts on the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns and achieved great success. This great revolutionary movement concluded victoriously in June.

Under the great call of Chairman Mao to "Increase Production and Practice Economy to Support the Chinese People's Volunteers," and on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, our overriding central task now is to vigorously develop industrial and agricultural production and broadly promote the exchange of materials in order to strengthen economic construction. All other tasks should be subordinate to and serve this central task, just as all tasks in the past during the war period had to be subordinate to and serve the victory of the war.

Now I will briefly report to you on several major tasks to be undertaken in the future for your review.

I. On Industrial Production

The various industries in the North China region, including steel, iron, coal, electricity, machinery, cement, and textiles, have generally recovered and in some parts exceeded their historical peak levels after three years of effort. According to the central government's policy of comprehensive recovery and key construction, the planned output of steel ingots and pig iron in the region this year should be more than 70 percent higher than last year, with other increases as follows: steel products more than doubled, machine tools one and a half times, electric motors two and a half times, and coal and electricity each 18 percent. The tasks assigned to us by the Central People's Government are significant, but our current actual leadership strength and work experience are still insufficient. This requires us to study diligently, overcome difficulties, and continuously improve in order to victoriously complete this significant task.

Private industry has also developed greatly with the support of the state in various aspects. Taking Tianjin as an example, by the end of 1951, the number of private industrial enterprises had increased by 53 percent compared to the end of 1949, and the number of employees had increased by 43 percent. In Beijing, the number of employees in private industry increased by 60 percent in 1951 compared to 1949, and during the same period, the total value of production was more than eight times that of 1949.

In the second half of the year, efforts should be focused on the following specific tasks:

(1) Fully promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy. This campaign aims not only to comprehensively fulfill this year's state plan and the plan to increase production and practice economy, but more importantly, to focus on improving production management, improving labor organization, improving technology and product quality, establishing cost management and planning management, so that the production competition campaign becomes the most effective production reform movement, laying the foundation for economic accounting and completely ending the transformation process of turning old enterprises into new ones, so that we can master systematic management experience.

The original target for the region's increase production and practice economy task was four trillion yuan, but due to the extensive discussions by employees, the exploration of potential, and selfless labor, it has now increased to six trillion yuan. The competition campaign has been fully launched and has achieved considerable success; however, the following three issues urgently need to be resolved: First, pay attention to safety facilities and worker health. In the past six months, accidents have occurred repeatedly, and deaths and injuries have increased. The number of casualties in factories and enterprises in Tianjin from January to June this year increased by 42 percent compared to the same period last year. Local authorities should concentrate their efforts to resolve this issue. Second, although product quality has improved since the campaign, the rate of defective and substandard products is still high, and the phenomenon of waste products and rework is also very serious. Production should be increased on the premise of improving quality, and further efforts should be made to achieve low cost, high quality, and good value for money. Third, it is necessary to seriously promote advanced production experience, earnestly study and solve new problems arising in the promotion of advanced experience and production reform, so that the backward parts catch up with the advanced units and production is carried out in a coordinated manner; and organizing rhythmic production according to indicator charts is the basic way to solve this problem.

Capital construction has already occupied a very important position this year and must be well grasped and led, strictly in accordance with the "Interim Measures for Capital Construction Work" promulgated by the central government, and efforts should be made to learn this work.

(2) While strengthening the leadership of state-owned and public-owned factories and mines, strengthen the leadership of private enterprises. Private industry accounts for a considerable proportion of industrial production in North China, with more than 600,000 employees and a total product value of about 36 percent of the total industrial product value. Therefore, it is necessary to earnestly implement the relevant policies pointed out by Director Chen Yun in his "Speech at the Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce," so that all legitimate private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood can achieve further development. At present, all provinces and cities have adopted various effective measures—processing orders, loans, sales, etc.—to solve some new problems that have arisen in further developing production on the basis of the victory of the "Five-Anti" movement. For example, in the first half of this year, Beijing increased processing orders by 114 percent compared to the same period last year, and the processing volume of major commodities in the second quarter increased by more than 70 percent compared to the first quarter, thereby driving the production of more than 30 types of industries, 3,000 factories, and nearly 20,000 employees in private dyeing, knitting, and chemical industries. For example, the Tianjin Trust Company has purchased finished products from private factories at a discounted price of more than 450 billion yuan in the past five months, accounting for 67.8 percent of the company's total purchases during this period. The Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China provided loans of more than 450 billion yuan to private industrial and commercial households from June 1 to July 24, benefiting about 20,000 industrial and commercial households.

(3) Strengthen the leadership of handicraft production. In addition to 14 large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Taiyuan, there are also 76 larger towns with a population of more than 10,000 in the region, with about 65,000 industrial and commercial households, and various types of handicraft production in the vast rural areas are even larger in quantity. These handicraft producers should be given sufficient attention and necessary guidance and support.

II. On Agricultural Production

The planned grain output for the region this year has exceeded the pre-war total output by 3 percent; the planned cotton output has exceeded the pre-war peak output by 70 percent.

The main feature of this year's agricultural production is the unprecedented large-scale and vigorous patriotic production increase competition campaign throughout the region, which has greatly promoted the production enthusiasm of farmers and greatly tapped the potential capacity of agricultural production. This competition campaign is also a good way for farmers to conduct self-criticism, self-education, and overcome conservative thinking, and promote advanced production experience, thereby advancing various tasks in rural areas. Our main measures can be divided into the following aspects:

(1) The agricultural production increase competition is closely combined with political tasks. Therefore, the patriotism and collectivism of farmers have been greatly enhanced, and have become the main driving force for promoting production increases. "Compare production increases, compare mutual assistance, compare cooperation, and compare patriotism" has become the action slogan of the vast number of farmers, and the concept of "labor is glorious" has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. In this way, the production cause of the vast number of working farmers is linked with the national construction tasks, correcting the erroneous tendency of purely "getting rich" in some areas in the past.

(2) The production increase competition campaign is combined with the mutual assistance and cooperation movement. This year, more than 60 percent of the agricultural labor force in the region has been organized, and more than 80 percent in advanced areas. In mutual aid teams, year-round mutual aid accounts for about one-third of the total. More than 1,600 agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the region, establishing a new direction for agricultural production cooperativization. The significant features of this year's mutual aid and cooperation movement are: First, it is closely integrated with technology, so that agricultural productivity can be rapidly developed on the basis of organization. Second, "combination contracts" are signed between mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives. Through this contract, production cooperation and supply and marketing cooperation are combined, further strengthening the connection between the state and farmers, industry and agriculture, and cities and villages. Strive to organize 80 percent of the agricultural labor force this year, while preventing formalism. Agricultural production cooperatives will be the focus of pilot projects this year, and will have new developments next year.

(3) Develop water conservancy on a large scale. Water conservancy construction is a long-term and important construction task in agricultural production in North China. This year, the two major water conservancy projects of diverting the Yellow River to benefit the Wei River and the Huangyang Gate have been completed, and the construction of the Guanting Reservoir has begun. Great achievements have been made in mobilizing the masses to widely develop small-scale water conservancy construction. According to incomplete statistics, the irrigated area of ​​cultivated land in the region has been expanded by more than 8 million mu this year.

(4) Continuing to overcome various disasters is an important link in striving for increased production in rural areas. North China suffered from floods in the south and droughts in the north, insect pests, and frost last year, and the disasters were severe and long-lasting. Thanks to the deep concern and clear instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the policy of combining mass mutual assistance with state assistance and combining solving the current difficulties of the masses with long-term construction was implemented, allocating large amounts of disaster relief grain, loans, and issuing large amounts of winter clothing, giving full play to all the strength of the masses, providing sufficient conditions for overcoming the famine, and the local leadership organs attached great importance to disaster relief work, so that it was possible to victoriously overcome the very serious disasters and lay the foundation for this year's agricultural production increase. At the beginning of this year, efforts were put into the struggle against drought and disaster prevention, and thanks to the timely instructions from the central government and the vast number of masses who have rich experience in disaster prevention and resistance, it is generally possible to put out disasters at any time they occur. In addition to preventing and controlling pests such as aphids and locusts, we must pay special attention to strengthening the leadership of flood control work to ensure that there are no major dangers during the flood season. Areas prone to early frost should mobilize the masses to prepare for frost prevention.

(5) The state has given various assistance to agricultural production, providing farmers with means of production and means of livelihood through loans and material exchanges, and solving many difficulties in production for farmers. In order to meet the needs of farmers for borrowing and saving, and to limit the development of rural usury, banks can establish a large number of financial groups in rural areas to actively carry out savings and loan work; supply and marketing cooperatives can establish credit departments to handle credit business concurrently; and mobilize the masses to pilot credit cooperatives.

In general, thanks to the above efforts and timely rainfall, agricultural production has achieved new achievements this year. The average yield per unit area of ​​wheat in the region this year has exceeded 30 percent of last year, and many new high-yield records and high-yield models have emerged, implementing the policy of combining universal production increase with the cultivation of high-yield models. According to the current situation, if there are no irresistible natural disasters, a bumper harvest of autumn crops is very promising. The Beginning of Autumn has passed, and we should actively prepare for autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, wheat planting, and strive to complete the autumn tax collection task. After the autumn harvest, widely carry out mass appraisal and comparison campaigns. On the basis of the appraisal and comparison campaigns, hold local labor model conferences or labor model representative conferences, summarize experience, and conduct awards to welcome new production tasks next year.

III. On Trade Work

With the rapid recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, the people's demand for the development of trade work is also becoming more and more urgent. In 1952, the total value of state-owned trade purchases and sales in North China increased greatly compared to 1951. In recent years, legitimate private commerce has also developed greatly, with increases in the number of households and capital, and its scope of activities has also become increasingly broad. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the prices of more than 4,000 kinds of commodities in North China decreased by an average of about 5 percent.

After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, we adopted a series of measures to eliminate the temporary economic stagnation, smooth the exchange of materials, and gradually restore processing orders, purchases, loans, and other businesses to private industry and commerce. After the North China Material Exchange Conference in May and more than 1,200 small material exchange meetings held in various provinces, cities, and counties, and participation in material exchange conferences in other regions, the total transaction amount was about 2 trillion yuan, plus 90 percent of the 1.6 trillion yuan contracts signed at the North China Material Exchange Exhibition last fall have been fulfilled, and the native products in the North China region have been basically sold. In terms of major materials, public and private transactions have developed compared to the same period last year. At present, although there are still some backlogs of industrial products, it is estimated that a new and lasting prosperous situation will soon appear due to various favorable conditions and efforts in all aspects. To this end:

(1) A production increase and economy practice competition campaign is also being launched in the trade and cooperation system, closely cooperating with the two major production increase competition campaigns in industry and agriculture. This movement focuses on exceeding the completion of purchase and sales plans, accelerating capital turnover, saving commodity circulation costs, and reducing costs. In terms of business style, the competition content of "low price, good quality, good attitude, fair scales and full measures" has also been put forward, which has been warmly welcomed by the masses. The more profound purpose of this movement is to mobilize all employees to conduct inventory and asset verification, thoroughly investigate warehouses, sort commodities, disclose costs, review prices, accelerate commodity circulation, and save expenses and reduce costs at every link, in order to lay the foundation for the implementation of economic accounting by trade and cooperation departments. A larger-scale material exchange conference is planned to be held in Tianjin in October this year, and various forms of material exchange meetings should also be held in various places.

(2) Widely carry out urban and rural material exchange work, strengthen wholesale and retail business, and especially strengthen the management of primary markets. In the future, state-owned trade and cooperatives should establish department store wholesale warehouses in important economic centers, sign contracts with each other according to plans, directly allocate goods, and strictly implement the allocation and settlement and cash management systems. At present, vigorously organize the movement to promote industrial products, and use all public, private, and cooperative forces to send industrial products to the rural market.

IV. On Financial Work

Ensure the completion of the tax revenue tasks assigned to us by the central government. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the patriotic production increase and economy practice competition movement was fully launched, the market became increasingly active, the wheat harvest was bumper, and the autumn harvest is promising, and a new economic situation that is more prosperous than in the past will inevitably appear. If we can seriously tap the potential economic power and oppose conservative thinking, this year's tax revenue task can be completely completed and strive to exceed. In addition, this year's agricultural tax per mu in North China has been reduced by 12 percent compared to last year, and it is stipulated that all surcharges should be abolished and arbitrary apportionments should be prohibited. As long as we earnestly implement the tax revenue policy of "investigating fields and determining output, calculating and collecting taxes according to rates, and reducing and exempting taxes according to law," the agricultural tax revenue task can not only be successfully completed, but also further encourage the production enthusiasm of farmers and promote the development of the patriotic production increase movement, as can be clearly seen from this year's summer tax collection.

Implement the financial supervision system, strictly enforce financial discipline; thoroughly clean up finances and verify the family property. Not only should each province, city, and special zone conduct inspections according to the instructions of the central government and make special reports, but each county (banner) must also conduct inspections and cleanups in the spirit of the "Three-Anti" movements without exception, report to higher levels, and at the people's representative conference, the county head should report the financial work and cleanup results to the people's representatives from all walks of life and listen to the opinions of the people's representatives. In the future, the local financial revenue and expenditure situation should be reported to the people's representative conference and the people's government committee regularly and form a system.

In order to implement the unified management of village (town) local finances and prohibit arbitrary apportionments, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, the scope of guarantees, permissions, and prohibitions is stipulated as the basic policy for rectifying village finances.

Mobilize the masses to investigate fields and determine output to make the burden more fair and reasonable.

Establish and improve economic construction financial institutions at all levels, earnestly study enterprise financial management, and strictly implement the central government's capital construction appropriation procedures.

V. While completing the above economic and financial tasks and welcoming large-scale national economic construction, we must further consolidate and strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship.

Economy and politics cannot be separated. At present, we must further expand people's democracy to give full play to the high enthusiasm and creativity of the people in various national construction tasks; at the same time, we must further eliminate counter-revolutionaries to ensure the smooth progress of national economic construction.

(1) The first county head conference in North China last year decided that the people's representative conferences of all counties (banners) should exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress to elect county heads, deputy county heads, and members of the county people's government, in order to further expand people's democracy, thoroughly overcome the serious bureaucratic style in the organs of power, strengthen the connection between the people's government and the people, and consolidate the mass foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship. Since then, people's representative conferences have been held in all counties, of which 110 counties have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress. The remaining 200 counties (banners) must fully exercise the functions and powers of the county people's congress this winter and next spring in conjunction with the central work and the anti-bureaucracy struggle, in order to further strengthen the construction of the people's democratic regime.

(2) In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, the problems exposed in the court work are extremely serious and urgently need to be rectified and transformed. The methods of rectification and transformation are mainly three aspects: ideological struggle, organizational adjustment, and strengthening leadership, namely: First, eliminate the reactionary Six Laws viewpoints and the Kuomintang judicial style of the old judicial personnel; second, clean up some bad elements with deep-rooted bad habits, doing evil, and irreparable, adjust some personnel who are not suitable for trial work, and at the same time, transfer a group of strong cadres to serve as leadership backbones; finally, people's governments at all levels should strengthen regular inspections and leadership of the people's courts.

VI. Vigorously promote the Qi Jianhua rapid literacy method and strive to basically eliminate illiteracy in the region in four or five years.

It is required that by the end of this year, the semi-literacy and illiteracy of about 20 to 30 percent of the nearly 60,000 district-level cadres should be eliminated first; among the more than 2.5 million employees, the semi-literacy and illiteracy of the more than 800,000 industrial workers should be eliminated first. The focus of eliminating illiteracy is farmers, because the vast number of farmers are the reserve force of workers and soldiers. Only by completely eliminating the semi-literacy and illiteracy of farmers, especially young and middle-aged farmers, can the historical task of eliminating illiteracy be fundamentally completed. This year, only key experiments can be carried out in rural areas, actively training teachers and organizing teams to eliminate illiteracy. After gaining experience, it will be fully promoted. We must allocate necessary cadres and funds to do this work well.

VII. On the issue of rectifying and training rural cadres.

Due to the profound impact of the "Three-Anti" movement above the county level, and also because some rural cadres have committed errors of corruption, waste, and coercion and commandism, and some of them are very serious, the vast number of masses and rural cadres are urgently demanding to solve this problem in order to promote democracy, strengthen unity, educate cadres and the masses, improve work, and strengthen rural construction. According to the above situation, the main methods for rectification and training in rural areas should be: On the one hand, the main cadres of the county are directly responsible for concentrating the main rural cadres in batches for rectification and learning and inspection work. At the same time, work teams are sent to the villages to carry out work, and then the two sides meet (for example, in the form of a representative meeting) to solve the problem.

The rectification and training of rural cadres must be combined with rural production, urban and rural material exchange, and the work of the people's representative conference, and cannot be separated from each other, and must ensure that rectification, production, and work are not delayed.

VIII. Pay attention to the leadership of minority nationality work and regional autonomous region work.

(1) In areas where various minority nationalities live, we should implement national regional autonomy and earnestly help various national autonomous regions carry out various construction tasks.

(2) For scattered minority nationalities, we must guarantee their equal rights, pay attention to guaranteeing and improving their lives, so that each can get what they want, and we must respect their customs, religious beliefs, and languages ​​and writing.

(3) Help the construction work of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, so that the economic construction of Inner Mongolia and North China can be more closely coordinated.

(4) Organize the study of national policies in a planned way.

The above are the main tasks we should do in the future. Other tasks such as the patriotic health movement, the construction of old base areas, ideological transformation work, militia work, and labor employment should be implemented in accordance with the instructions of the central government and existing plans, and will not be described in detail here.

Finally, we must accept the profound lessons of the "Three-Anti" movement, earnestly strengthen ideological and policy leadership, enhance the mass viewpoints of state personnel, and make them put the interests of the state and the people first. The various policies and laws of the Central People's Government must be organized for cadres to earnestly study, and important policies and laws should be conveyed and discussed at the people's government committees, people's representative conferences, and people's congresses at all levels, and implementation measures suitable for the local specific conditions should be formulated. Second, strengthen the planning of various tasks, tap the great potential strength of the broad masses of the people, and constantly overcome various conservative ideas. Third, grasp the central work, promote advanced work experience, boldly mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and implement the work methods of the mass line to make our work more in-depth and thorough.

Thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and the joint efforts of staff at all levels and all the people, we have achieved great success in various aspects of our work, but the shortcomings in our work must also be actively overcome by effective methods. In this way, we can achieve greater success.

    关于华北工作情况和今后几项主要工作的报告
    （一九五二年八月十五日在政务院华北行政委员会第一次委员会议上的报告）
    政务院华北行政委员会主任　刘澜涛
    今年上半年全区县以上的领导机关，集中主要力量进行了“三反”和“五反”斗争，获得了很大成绩。这一伟大的革命运动，已于六月间胜利结束。
    在毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召下，在“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上，我们今后压倒一切的中心任务，就是全力发展工业和农业生产，广泛促进物资交流，以加强经济建设工作。其它各项工作都应服从并服务于这个中心工作，如同过去在战争时期一切工作都要服从并服务于战争的胜利一样。
    现在我向大家扼要报告今后要做的几项主要工作，请予审查。
    一、关于工业生产
    华北区的各种工业，包括钢、铁、煤、电、机械、水泥及纺织等在内，经过三年来的努力，大体已经恢复到并且部分地超过了历史上的最高水平。根据中央全面恢复与重点建设的方针，今年全区钢锭与生铁的计划产量要比去年提高百分之七十以上，其他提高的比例是：钢材一倍以上，工作母机一倍半，电动机二倍半，煤、电各百分之十八。中央人民政府给予我们的任务是重大的，但我们目前的实际领导力量和工作经验还是很不够的，这就需要我们努力学习，克服困难，不断进步，以胜利地完成这一重大任务。
    私营工业经过国家多方面的扶持，亦有很大发展。以天津市为例，一九五一年年底较之一九四九年年底，私营工业的户数增加百分之五十三，职工数增加百分之四十三。北京市私营工业职工人数一九五一年比一九四九年增加百分之六十，同期，生产总值等于一九四九年的八倍多。
    下半年应集中力量作好下列具体工作：
    （一）全面推进增产节约竞赛运动。此次竞赛运动，不仅要全面完成今年的国家计划和增产节约计划，更重要的目标是集中在改进生产管理，改善劳动组织，提高技术及产品质量，建立成本管理和计划管理，使生产竞赛运动成为最有效的生产改革运动，以打下经济核算制的基础，彻底结束将旧企业转变为新企业的改造过程，使我们能够掌握系统的经营管理经验。
    全区增产节约任务原订为四万亿元，由于职工的广泛讨论、发掘潜力和进行忘我的劳动，现在已经增加到六万亿元。竞赛运动已经全面展开，并已获得相当成就；但下列三个问题尚亟待解决：第一、注意安全设施和工人健康。半年以来，事故迭出，死伤增加。天津市全市工厂企业今年一至六月份发生的伤亡事故，较去年同期增加百分之四十二。对此问题，各地应集中力量加以解决。第二、运动以来产品质量虽有改进，但劣品、次品率仍高，废品及返工现象亦很严重。应在提高质量的前提下增加产量，进一步做到成本低、质量好，物美价廉。第三、必须认真推广先进的生产经验，切实研究并解决在推广先进经验和生产改革中所产生的新问题，使落后的部分跟上先进的单位，协调地进行生产；而按指示图表组织有节奏的生产，则是解决这一问题的基本办法。
    基本建设，在今年已经占了一个很重要的地位，必须很好地掌握与领导，完全按照中央颁布的“基本建设工作暂行办法”办事，并努力学会此项工作。
    （二）在加强对国营、公营厂矿企业领导的同时，加强对私营企业的领导。私营工业在华北的工业生产中，占有相当比重，计有职工六十余万人，产品总值约占全部工业产品总值的百分之三十六左右。因此，必须认真执行陈云主任“在中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上的讲话”中所指出的有关政策，使一切正当的有利于国计民生的私营工业，获得进一步的发展。现在各省、市均已采取各种有效措施——加工订货、贷款、包销等，以解决在“五反”运动胜利的基础上进一步发展生产中所发生的一些新问题。例如北京市今年上半年加工订货较去年同期增加百分之一百一十四，第二季度主要商品的加工数量比第一季度增加百分之七十强，从而带动了私营染织、针织、化工等三十余种行业、三千余户工厂和近二万职工的生产。再如天津信托公司，五个月来共收购私营工厂的成品折价四千五百余亿元，占该公司这一时期收购总额的百分之六十七点八。人民银行天津市分行，自六月一日至七月二十四日对私营工商户贷款四千五百余亿元，得到扶持的工商户约二万户。
    （三）加强对手工业生产的领导。全区除北京、天津、唐山、太原等十四个大中城市外，还有一万人口以上的较大城镇七十六个，工商业户约六万五千户，广大乡村中各种类型的手工业生产，数量更大。对于这些手工业生产者，应足够重视，予以必要的指导与扶持。
    二、关于农业生产
    全区今年粮食的计划产量已超过战前总产量百分之三；棉花计划产量超过战前最高产量的百分之七十。
    今年农业生产的主要特点，是全区展开了空前规模的轰轰烈烈的爱国增产竞赛运动，高度发扬了农民的生产积极性，大大地发掘了农业生产上的潜在能力。这一竞赛运动，同时也是农民进行自我批评、自我教育和克服保守思想、推广先进生产经验的良好方式，从而使农村中的各种工作都向前推进了一步。我们的主要措施可分以下几方面：
    （一）农业增产竞赛和政治任务紧密结合。因此，农民的爱国主义精神和集体主义精神大为增强，并成为推动增产的主要动力。“比增产、比互助、比合作、比爱国”成为广大农民的行动口号，“劳动光荣”的观念深入人心。这样，就将广大劳动农民的生产事业和国家建设任务联系起来，纠正了过去某些地区单纯“发财致富”的错误倾向。
    （二）增产竞赛运动和互助合作运动相结合。今年全区组织起来的农业劳动力已达到百分之六十以上，先进地区已达到百分之八十以上。在互助组中，常年互助约占总数的三分之一。全区已建立了农业生产合作社一千六百多个，树立了农业生产合作化的新方向。今年互助合作运动的显著特点：一是和技术密切结合，使农业生产力在组织起来的基础上得到迅速发展。二是互助组、农业生产合作社和供销合作社之间订立“结合合同”，经过这种合同，把生产合作和供销合作结合在一起，使国家和农民、工业和农业、城市和乡村的联系更进一步密切起来了。争取在今年以内把百分之八十的农业劳动力组织起来，同时防止形式主义。农业生产合作社今年是重点试办，明年将有新的发展。
    （三）大量发展水利。水利建设是华北农业生产上的长期性的重要建设任务。今年已经完成了引黄济卫、黄杨闸两大水利工程，开始了官厅水库的修建。在发动群众广泛发展小型水利建设方面，获得了很大成绩，据不完全统计，今年全区已扩大了耕地灌溉面积八百余万亩。
    （四）继续战胜各种灾害，是争取农村增产的一个重要环节。华北去年南涝北旱，虫害霜冻，灾重灾长。由于毛主席和中央人民政府的深切关怀和明确指示，实行群众互济和国家帮助相结合、解决群众当前困难和长期建设相结合的方针，拨发大批赈粮、贷款和发放大批寒衣，充分发挥群众的一切力量，使战胜灾荒有了充足的条件，又加各地领导机关十分重视救灾工作，因而得以胜利地战胜了十分严重的灾害，并打下今年农业增产的基础。今年一开始，便投入了防旱抗旱和防灾的斗争，由于中央的及时指示和广大群众已有了防灾抗灾的丰富经验，一般做到了灾害随时发生随时扑灭。当前除防治蚜虫、蝗虫等灾害外，要特别注意加强对防汛工作的领导，保证在大汛时期不出大危险。早霜地区则要发动群众做好防霜准备工作。
    （五）国家对农业生产给了多方面的援助，通过贷款和物资交流等工作，供应了农民以生产资料和生活资料，解决了农民在生产上的许多困难。为了解决农民的借贷和储蓄的需要，并限制农村高利贷的发展，可由银行在农村中大量建立金融小组，积极开展储贷工作；供销合作社成立信贷部，兼办信贷业务；发动群众试办信贷合作社。
    总起来说，由于以上各方面的努力和雨水及时，今年农业生产已获得了新的成就。今年全区小麦单位面积产量平均超过了去年百分之三十，而且出现了许多丰产新纪录和丰产模范，贯彻了普遍增产和培养丰产典型相结合的方针。按现在情况，如果没有不可抗拒的自然灾害，大秋作物的丰收是很有希望的。立秋已过，应积极准备作好秋收、秋耕、种麦等工作，并努力完成秋征任务。秋收后，广泛开展群众性的评比运动，在评比运动的基础上，召开各地的劳动模范大会或劳动模范代表会议，总结经验，进行奖励，以迎接明年新的生产任务。
    三、关于贸易工作
    随着工业和农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，人民对于发展贸易工作的要求也越来越迫切。一九五二年华北国营贸易收购总值与推销总值均较一九五一年大为增加了。这几年来，正当的私营商业也有很大发展，户数、资金都有增加，其活动范围也日益广阔。“三反”“五反”运动后，华北四千余种商品的价格平均降低了百分之五左右。
    “三反”“五反”后，我们曾采取了一系列的措施，来消除暂时出现的经济呆滞现象，畅通物资交流，并逐步恢复对私营工商业的加工订货和收购、贷款等业务。经过五月华北区物资交流大会和各省、市、县所举行的一千二百多次小型物资交流会，并参加其他大区的物资交流大会，全部成交总额约二万亿元，加上去秋华北物资交流展览会上所订的一万六千亿元的合同已有百分之九十兑现，现华北全区土产已基本上推销出去。在主要物资方面，公私交易比去年同期都有发展。目前工业品虽仍有某些积压现象，但由于各种有利条件和各方面的努力，估计很快就要出现新的持久的繁荣局面。为此：
    （一）在贸易、合作系统也正在展开一个增产节约竞赛运动，和工业、农业两大增产竞赛运动密切配合。这个运动以超额完成购销计划、加速资金周转、节省商品流转费用、降低成本为中心内容。在经营作风方面，也提出了“价廉物美，态度好，秤平斗满，尺码足”的竞赛内容，受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎。这一运动更深刻的目的，是要发动全体职工进行清产核资，彻查仓库，商品排队，公开成本，审查价格，加速商品流转，在每个环节上节省开支降低成本，以便为贸易合作部门实行经济核算制打下基础。今年十月间准备在天津召开一次规模更大的物资交流大会，同时各地亦应召开各种形式的物资交流会议。
    （二）广泛开展城乡物资交流工作，加强批发、零售业务，特别加强初级市场的管理。今后国营贸易和合作社应在重要经济中心设立百货批发栈，彼此按计划签订合同，直线拨货，并严格执行划拨清算和现金管理制度。目前，大力组织推销工业品的运动，运用一切公营、私营及合作社力量把工业品送到农村市场去。
    四、关于财政工作
    保证完成中央所给予我们的税收任务。“三反”“五反”运动后，爱国增产节约竞赛运动全面展开，市场日趋活跃，小麦丰收，秋收有望，经济上必然会出现较之以往更为繁荣的新气象。我们如能认真发掘经济的潜在力量，反对保守思想，今年的税收任务是完全可以完成并争取超过的。此外，华北今年的农业税每负担亩较去年减少百分之十二，并规定取消一切附加，禁止任意摊派，只要认真贯彻“查田定产，依率计征，依法减免”的税收政策，农业税收任务不仅可以顺利完成，而且将会进一步鼓舞农民的生产积极性，推动爱国增产运动的开展，这从今年夏征中已可明显地看出来。
    实行财政监察制度，严格财政纪律；彻底清理财政，查清家底。不仅各省、市、专区应按中央指示进行检查，作出专门报告，各县（旗）亦须无例外地以“三反”精神进行检查与清理，层报上级，并在人民代表会议上，由县长向各界人民代表报告财政工作和清查结果，听取人民代表的意见。今后，应定期将地方财政收支情况，向人民代表会议和人民政府委员会报告，并形成制度。
    为实行村（乡）镇地方财政的统一管理，禁止任意摊派，根据毛主席的指示，规定了保证、准许和禁止的范围，作为我们整顿村财政的基本方针。
    发动群众查田定产，使负担更加公平合理。
    建立和健全各级经济建设财务机构，认真学习企业财务管理，严格执行中央基本建设拨款程序。
    五、与完成上述各项财经任务、迎接大规模的国家经济建设同时，必须进一步巩固与加强人民民主专政。
    经济和政治是不能分离的。目前要进一步扩大人民民主，以发挥人民群众在国家各项建设工作中的高度积极性和创造性；同时也要进一步肃清反革命分子，以保障国家经济建设的顺利进行。
    （一）去年华北第一次县长会议决定所有县（旗）的人民代表会议，都要代行人民代表大会的职权，选举县长、副县长及县人民政府的委员，以进一步扩大人民民主，彻底克服政权机关中严重的官僚主义作风，加强人民政府与人民群众的联系，巩固人民民主专政的群众基础。以后，各县都普遍召开了人民代表会议，其中有一百一十个县已经代行了人民代表大会的职权。其余二百余县（旗）务须在今冬明春结合中心工作和反官僚主义斗争全部代行县人民代表大会职权，以进一步加强人民民主政权的建设工作。
    （二）在“三反”“五反”斗争中暴露了法院工作中的问题是极端严重的，亟须整顿和改造。整顿和改造的办法，主要是思想斗争、组织调整和加强领导三方面，即：一要肃清旧司法人员中反动的六法观点和国民党的司法作风；二要清洗一些恶习甚深、为非作歹、不堪改造的坏分子，调整一些不适宜于作审判工作的人员，同时要调派一批坚强干部充任领导骨干，最后；各级人民政府要加强对人民法院的经常的检查和领导。
    六、大力推广祁建华速成识字法，争取在四、五年内大体上扫清全区的文盲。
    要求在今年年底，首先扫除近六万区级干部中约占百分之二十至三十的半文盲和文盲；在二百五十余万职工中，首先扫除八十余万产业工人中的半文盲和文盲。扫除文盲的重点是农民，因为广大农民是工人和士兵的后备力量，只有彻底扫除了农民中的特别是青壮年农民中的半文盲和文盲，才能从根本上完成扫除文盲这一历史任务。今年在农村中还只能进行重点试验，积极训练师资，组织扫除文盲的队伍，待取得经验后，再全面推广。我们必须拿出必需的干部和经费，作好此项工作。
    七、关于整训农村干部问题。
    由于县以上“三反”运动的深刻影响，也由于一部分农村干部犯有贪污、浪费及强迫命令的错误，个别的并很严重，因而广大群众和农村干部都迫切要求解决这个问题，借以发扬民主、加强团结，教育干部和群众，改善工作，加强农村建设。根据以上情况，在农村进行整训的主要方法应当是：一方面由县的主要干部直接负责，将农村主要干部分期分批集中，进行整风学习与检查工作，与此同时，即派工作队到村进行工作，然后双方会面（例如用代表会等形式）解决问题。
    农村干部的整训工作，必须和农村生产、城乡物资交流及人民代表会议的工作结合进行，不能彼此分离，切实做到整风、生产、工作都不耽误。
    八、注意少数民族工作和区域自治地区工作的领导
    （一）在各少数民族聚居的地区，应贯彻实现民族区域自治，切实帮助各民族自治区进行各项建设工作。
    （二）对于散居的少数民族，必须保障其平等权利，注意保障和改善其生活，使之各得其所，并须尊重其风俗习惯、宗教信仰和语言文字。
    （三）帮助内蒙古自治区的建设工作，使内蒙与华北两区域在经济建设上更加密切配合。
    （四）有计划地组织民族政策的学习。
    以上各项，就是我们今后应该做的主要工作，其它如爱国卫生运动、老根据地建设、思想改造工作、民兵工作和劳动就业等项工作，均应根据中央指示和已有计划贯彻实施，在此即不详述。
    最后，我们必须接受“三反”运动的深刻教训，认真加强思想政策领导，增强国家工作人员的群众观点，使他们把国家和人民的利益放在第一位。对中央人民政府各项政策法令，务须组织干部切实学习，重要的政策法令并应在各级人民政府委员会、人民代表会议和人民代表大会上传达讨论，制订适合当地具体情况的执行办法。第二、加强各种工作的计划性，发掘广大人民的伟大潜在力量，不断克服各种保守思想。第三、抓住中心工作，推广先进的工作经验，放手发动群众，依靠群众，贯彻群众路线的工作方法，把我们的工作搞得更深入、更透彻。
    由于毛主席、中央人民政府的英明领导，和各级工作人员及全体人民的共同努力，我们在各项工作方面，都已获得了很大成绩，但我们工作中所存在的缺点，也必须采取有效的办法，积极予以克服。这样，我们就能获得更大的成绩。
