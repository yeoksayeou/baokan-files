    People of France, Austria, and Other Countries Prepare to Welcome the World People's Peace Congress
    [Beijing News] A compilation of news reports: People in countries such as France, Austria, and Japan are actively preparing to welcome the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna at the end of this year.
    In France, the decision of the World Peace Council to convene the World People's Peace Congress has resonated deeply among people of all walks of life. Various discussion meetings held throughout France have studied concrete suggestions for consolidating the cause of world peace. Peace supporters in many provinces are planning peace gatherings on August 24th (the eighth anniversary of the French people's armed uprising against the German fascist aggressors). At a peace gathering held in a district of Marseille, peace supporters explained the tasks of the World People's Peace Congress to the masses and raised 40,000 francs on the spot as expenses for carrying out propaganda activities to welcome the World People's Peace Congress. French farmers, who have been hit hard by the continuous rise in industrial product prices and the increasing taxes, are increasingly determined to defend peace. They are actively preparing for the work of the farmers' peace conference scheduled for November. In the Lower Pyrenees province, fifteen mayors of the East Oloron and West Oloron districts issued a call to residents to hold local peace conferences, their slogans being: Oppose the ratification of the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Agreement" on the rearmament of West Germany, stop the wars in Indochina and Korea, immediately ban atomic and bacteriological weapons, and universally reduce armaments. The East Oloron and West Oloron district peace conference held on August 10 supported the call of the fifteen mayors. The National Committee of the French Republican Youth League also issued a declaration calling on French youth to actively participate in the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress. At present, the preparation work for the World People's Peace Congress has become a new driving force for the actions of peace supporters throughout France. More and more French people are now united under the banner of peace.
    The Austrian people warmly welcome the World People's Peace Congress being held in Vienna. The Austrian Peace Committee has received many resolutions and letters from groups and individuals expressing their willingness to help with the preparations for the Congress. In order to welcome the Congress, the Austrian people are stepping up their struggle for peace. The Austrian people are fiercely protesting against the US seizure of Salzburg farmers' land to build barracks, tank testing grounds and ammunition depots. Peace fighters conducted a poll among the residents of Salzburg on the issue of US war preparations in western Austria, and more than 90% of all residents resolutely opposed these war preparations. Many slogans appearing in Vienna, Salzburg and Linz read: "Yankees get out of Austria! We oppose American war gambling! Long live world peace!"
    The Japanese people are actively preparing for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and the World People's Peace Congress. In order to promote this preparatory work, the Japanese Committee for the Defense of Peace decided to convene the Japanese National Conference for the Defense of Peace in Tokyo on September 10.

    法奥等国人民筹备迎接世界人民和平大会
    【本报讯】综合消息：法国、奥地利和日本等国人民目前都在积极筹备迎接今年年底在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会。
    在法国，世界和平理事会召开世界人民和平大会的决定，在各阶层人民中引起了深刻的反响。在法国全国各地举行的各种讨论会，都研究了巩固世界和平事业的具体建议。许多省的和平拥护者都在八月二十四日（法国人民武装起义反抗德国法西斯侵略军八周年纪念日）布置和平联欢会。在马赛一个区举行的和平联欢会，和平拥护者在会上向群众解释了世界人民和平大会的任务，并当场募集了四万法郎，作为进行迎接世界人民和平大会的宣传活动的费用。由于工业品价格不断上涨，赋税日益增加而遭到打击的法国农民保卫和平的决心越来越强了。他们正在积极筹备定于十一月举行的农民拥护和平会议的工作。在下比利牛斯省，东奥洛隆和西奥洛隆区的十五个市长向居民发出举行地方和平会议的号召，他们的口号是：反对批准关于重新武装西德的“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团协定”，停止印度支那和朝鲜的战争，立即禁止原子和细菌武器，普遍裁减军备。八月十日举行的东奥洛隆和西奥洛隆区和平会议支持了十五个市长的号召。法国共和青年联盟全国委员会也发表了号召法国青年积极参加世界人民和平大会筹备工作的宣言。目前，世界人民和平大会的准备工作，已成为法国各地和平拥护者行动的一个新的推动力。现在已有越来越多的法国人民团结在和平旗帜之下。
    奥地利人民热烈欢迎世界人民和平大会在维也纳举行。奥地利和平委员会已收到许多团体和个人的决议案和信件，表示准备帮助大会的筹备工作。为了迎接大会，奥地利人民正加紧进行争取和平的斗争。奥地利人民激烈抗议美国没收萨尔斯堡农民的土地，以建造军营、坦克试验场及军火库的行为。和平战士们就美国在奥地利西部进行战争准备的问题在萨尔斯堡居民中进行了民意测验，全部居民中有百分之九十以上都坚决反对这些备战活动。在维也纳，萨尔斯堡及林嗣出现的许多标语都写道：“美国佬滚出奥地利！我们反对美国的战争赌博！世界和平万岁！”
    日本人民正在积极筹备亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和世界人民和平大会。为了推动这一筹备工作，日本保卫和平委员会决定九月十日在东京召开日本全国保卫和平大会。
