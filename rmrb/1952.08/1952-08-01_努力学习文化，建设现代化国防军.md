Strive to Learn Culture and Build a Modern National Defense Army

The "Character Regiment Commander" - Li Xinyun

Editor: A "Character Regiment Commander" has emerged in a certain unit of the North China Military Region. The "Character Regiment Commander" is named Li Xinyun and is a civil servant.

Li Xinyun was originally semi-illiterate, a student in the first grade of the "On-the-Job Primary School." After a month of intensive literacy training, he mastered more than 2,000 characters. Within two weeks of returning, he read novels like "New Children's Heroes," "Prosperity for Both People and Wealth," and "The Hurricane," as well as many newspapers and magazines. This miracle caused a sensation among his comrades, and they called him the "Character Regiment Commander."

Wang Jun, who lives with Li Xinyun, is a fourth-grade student in the "On-the-Job Primary School." His education level used to be much higher than Li Xinyun's. Seeing that Li Xinyun could read novels as thick as bricks, he was somewhat skeptical. He wanted to test Li Xinyun. He read "The Hurricane" with Li Xinyun and discussed the book's contents with him. Li Xinyun was not only able to accurately tell the stories in the book, but also gave an analysis and critique of the characters. Wang Jun was convinced and happily said, "The intensive literacy method really solves the problem!"

After Li Xinyun became the "Character Regiment Commander," he actively thought of ways to train his "troops." He thought: commanding more than 2,000 characters is the same as commanding more than 2,000 soldiers. They must be well-trained to listen to commands and win battles. Therefore, in his spare time, he either went to the library to read or sat in his room writing a diary. He read many books and received a new education, and his class consciousness and political level gradually improved. With culture, his brain worked better, and studying military and political affairs was no longer as difficult as it used to be.

Li Xinyun is not satisfied with his current achievements. He recently made a study plan: First, in his spare time, take advantage of every opportunity to write the more than 2,000 characters several times; Second, write a diary every day; Third, take notes when listening to lectures; Fourth, in addition to doing his job better, seize the time to read newspapers and books every day and be friends with the library.

As soon as his plan came out, his classmates said, "Aren't you going to be promoted to 'Character Division Commander'?" He grinned and said, "Let's all become 'Character Division Commanders' in the whole army!"

Studying Culture on the Position

On the morning of June 13, I arrived at a certain battalion of the anti-aircraft artillery unit. The battalion instructor introduced me to some information and then excitedly said to me, "Go and see the Fourth Company, it's really like a 'Culture Mountain' there, and the soldiers have all become 'Culture People'!"

The Fourth Company is stationed on a beautiful little mountain. During the afternoon break, I walked to the hillside and saw groups of soldiers, some holding meetings under the trees and others reading books and learning Pinyin. A large group of soldiers was engaged in recreational activities on the top of the mountain. The green anti-aircraft guns stretched into the sky, and in front of each gun was a small group of soldiers. Some soldiers were monitoring the sky with binoculars, and some were sitting in the gun positions reading language textbooks.

The deputy company commander took me to visit the company's club. The club was full of the soldiers' homework, including more than a dozen poems and rhythmic dialogues. The deputy company commander said that the soldiers who could write such short poems were still illiterate twenty days ago.

I also visited the library. There are hundreds of books here, including comic strips, popular combat literature, and Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and other works. The deputy company commander said: Before the intensive literacy method was implemented in the army, there were very few books here, and even fewer people came to read them. After the intensive literacy method was implemented, the books here were not enough. To meet the needs of the soldiers, the company bought a batch of new books; the soldiers also donated many books, and Zhang Jingyan (a soldier) alone donated more than fifty books. The cultural officer told me that the soldiers had recently bought nearly a hundred books, and they had bought forty or fifty dictionaries alone.

Talking about the soldiers' learning enthusiasm, the deputy company commander pointed to squad leader Wang Derun, who was reading a book at the entrance of the club, and said, "Look at him, he's simply buried in the book." He said that Wang Derun had read seven books with tens of thousands of words in a day and a half. Before the intensive literacy learning was implemented in the army, he was still a semi-literate person who could not recognize five hundred characters.

I walked to Wang Derun and saw that he was reading a very thick "Collection of Plays." I asked him if he could understand it, and he said very modestly: "There are still some characters that I don't recognize, but I can understand the meaning." Wang Derun has the best way to read books. He needs a "treasure" (soldiers call dictionaries "treasures") and two "tools" (notebook and pen) to read a book. When he encounters unfamiliar characters, he writes them down in his notebook and then looks them up in the dictionary. Every time he finishes reading a book, he learns a lot of new characters.

We have established a "Unmanned Library" in our company

Editor: Last November, our company collected more than 160 kinds of books and magazines and 17 comic books and organized a library. At first, this library was managed by a dedicated person. After a week of experimentation, a difficulty arose: there were too many people reading books, and one person could not manage it. The Revolutionary Military Committee held a meeting to discuss this issue. Everyone studied the experience of the "unmanned bookstore" at the Beijing Railway Station and came to the conclusion that as long as there is sound organization and discipline and everyone is educated to cherish the library, we can create an "unmanned library."

The company leaders mobilized the comrades and mobilized Party members and Youth League members to play an exemplary role; and used the assembly time to introduce the procedures for borrowing books in detail, and explained that the "unmanned library" is based on everyone's political consciousness and mutual supervision, and every comrade has the right to read and the obligation to keep it. In other words, the "unmanned library" is also a library responsible for everyone. The borrowing regulations were posted in the library, several pencils and a borrowing registration book were prepared, and then it was opened.

After the "unmanned library" was opened, some bad phenomena occurred. Some borrowers did not return the books on time or crumpled them by putting them in their pockets. We used a loudspeaker to mention the names of these comrades during meals and criticized this phenomenon at the squad meeting. This phenomenon was quickly corrected. When the books and magazines were checked and sorted at the end of last year, only one of the original books was missing (a comrade took it away when he was transferred); but thirteen more books and magazines and three more comic books were added. This is because the comrades who had books saw that the books were kept in the "unmanned library" as well as they were kept by themselves, and they could also be provided for everyone to read, so they automatically sent their books to the "unmanned library."

    努力学习文化，建设现代化国防军
    “字团长”——李新云
    编辑同志：华北军区某部出现了一个“字团长”。“字团长”名叫李新云，是个公务员。
    李新云原来是个半文盲，是“在职小学”一年级的学员。经过一个月的速成识字学习，他掌握了两千多字。回来后两个星期，他就读了“新儿女英雄传”、“人财两旺”、“暴风骤雨”等小说和很多报刊。这一件奇迹轰动了同志们，大家就叫他“字团长”。
    和李新云住在一起的王俊，是“在职小学”四年级学员。他的文化程度，过去比李新云高得多。他看到李新云也能读像砖头那样厚的小说了，有些半信半疑。他想试试李新云到底怎么样。他和李新云在一起读“暴风骤雨”，并和李新云谈论这本书的内容。李新云不但能够正确地讲出书里的故事，并且对书里的人物作了一番分析批判。这一下，王俊服气了，他高兴地说：“速成识字法真能解决问题啊！”
    李新云当了“字团长”以后，就积极想法来训练他的“队伍”。他想：指挥两千多字和指挥两千多战士一样，必须把他们训练好了，他们才能听指挥，才能打胜仗。因此，他在业余时间，不是跑到图书馆看书，就是坐在屋里写日记。他看了许多书，受了新的教育，他的阶级觉悟和政治水平逐步提高了。有了文化，脑袋也就更好使了，学习军事和政治，再也不像过去那样困难了。
    李新云并不满足于现有的成绩。他最近订了一个学习计划：一，在业余时间，利用一切机会，把两千多字多写几遍；二，每天写一篇日记；三，在听课时记笔记；四，除了把本职工作做得更好以外，每天抓紧时间看报、看书，和图书馆做朋友。
    他这个计划一订出来，同班的同志们都说：“你这不是又要升‘字师长’了吗？”他把嘴一咧说：“咱们全军的同志要一起来当啊！”    马骏
    在阵地上学文化
    六月十三日上午，我到了高射炮部队某营。营教导员给我介绍了一些情况，然后兴奋地对我说：“你到四连去看看吧，那里真像一座‘文化山’，战士们都成了‘文化人’啦。”
    四连驻在一座风景幽美的小山上。在下午休息时间，我走到半山腰，看见一伙一伙的战士，有的在树底下开会，有的在看书、学拼音。山顶上有一大群战士正进行娱乐活动。绿油油的高射炮伸向天空，每门炮的跟前都有一小组战士。有的战士提着望远镜监视着天空，有的坐在炮位上念语文课本。
    副连长带我参观了连的俱乐部。俱乐部里贴满了战士的作业，其中有十几首诗歌和快板。副连长说，能作这样短小诗歌的战士，二十天前还是文盲。
    我又参观了图书室。这里有数百册书，其中有连环画，有通俗战斗文艺书籍，还有毛主席的“论人民民主专政”等著作。副连长说：部队推行速成识字法以前，这里的书很少，来看书的人更少。速成识字法推行以后，这里的书就不够用了。为了满足战士的要求，连里买了一批新书；战士们又捐献了许多书，仅张景炎（战士）一人就捐了五十多本。文化干事对我说，战士最近买的书将近一百册，光字典就买了四、五十本。
    谈到战士的学习情绪，副连长指着正在俱乐部门口看书的班长王德润说：“看看他吧，简直是钻到书里去了。”他说，王德润在一天半的时间中，看了有几万字的七本书。而在部队推行速成识字学习以前，他还是一个认不到五百字的半文盲。
    我走到王德润身旁，看见他正在看一本很厚的
    “剧本选集”。我问他能不能看懂，他很谦虚地说：“有些字还不认识，不过能看懂意思。”王德润看书最有办法，他看一本书要一件“宝贝”（战士称字典为“宝贝”），两样“家伙”（学习本和钢笔）。看书碰上生字，就在学习本上记下来，然后就查字典。每看完一本书，他就学会了不少生字。

    我们连里设立了“无人图书室”
    编辑同志：去年十一月间，我们连里搜集了一百六十多种书刊和十七本小人书，组织了一个图书室。开始，这个图书室是由专人负责管理的。经过一星期的试验，发生了一个困难：看书的人多，一个人管理不过来。革命军人委员会开会讨论了这个问题。大家研究了北京车站“无人售书处”的经验，得出一个结论：只要有健全的组织纪律，教育大家爱护图书室，就可以创办一个“无人图书室”。
    连首长就对同志们进行了动员，发动党、团员起模范作用；又利用集合时间，详细地介绍了借书的手续，并说明“无人图书室”是建立在大家的政治自觉、互相监督的基础上，每个同志都有阅读的权利和保管的义务。换句话说，“无人图书室”也就是大家负责的图书室。图书室内张贴了借书的规章，准备了几支铅笔和一个借书登记簿，然后就开幕了。
    “无人图书室”开办后，曾经发生过一些不好的现象。有些借书人不按时送还，或把书装在裤兜里弄皱了。我们用广播筒在吃饭时提出了这些同志的名字，并在班务会议上批评了这种现象。这种现象很快就纠正了。在去年年底清查整理书刊时，原有的书只少了一本（一个同志调动工作时带走了）；但却多出了十三本书刊和三本小人书。这是有书的同志看到在“无人图书室”保存书和自己保存一样，并且还能供给大家阅读，所以自动地把自己的书送到了“无人图书室”。
