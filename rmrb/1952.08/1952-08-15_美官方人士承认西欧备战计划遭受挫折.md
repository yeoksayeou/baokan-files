(Combined dispatches) U.S. officials have publicly admitted that the North Atlantic Group's war preparations plan has suffered serious setbacks, following the British government's announcement of a delay in its military expansion plan and France's expression of its inability to complete its own. General Bradley, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated in a speech on CBS on the 10th that the North Atlantic Treaty nations would not be able to achieve the goal of establishing 50 divisions this year and 96 to 98 divisions by 1954. A Paris dispatch from the International News Service on the 10th stated: "Key members of Ridgway's headquarters told INS reporters that they did not believe that more than 35 or 40 divisions of troops (including poorly equipped reserves) and more than 1,500 aircraft could be obtained by the end of 1952." "Senior Allied officers predict that the Atlantic Pact defense plan's 1952 goals will fall short by ten to fifteen divisions and 2,500 combat aircraft." In February of this year, the United States expended considerable effort to force the Lisbon meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council to pass a plan to establish 50 divisions by the end of this year, but it met a wall after five months of practical testing.

The main reason why the military expansion of the North Atlantic countries cannot be completed as planned is the severe economic crisis in these countries. British Prime Minister Churchill said when announcing the reduction of the military expansion plan that it was necessary to reduce military production and increase export production in order to save Britain from bankruptcy. After not receiving the dollar arms orders promised by the United States, France is also planning to reduce military expansion expenditures to save the French financial crisis. The economic situation of other Western European countries is also equally serious. An Associated Press dispatch acknowledged that the development of the economic crisis in Western European countries has "far outstripped General Ridgway's speed in establishing his Western European army."

Faced with the crisis in war preparations, the United States and its Western European vassal states are blaming each other. United Press said: "European sources believe that the reason for the delay in the (military expansion) plan should be attributed to the United States' delay in delivering the arms it promised to provide and its reduction in military aid. U.S. sources say that if the Europeans made the maximum effort as they promised, they could do better." This reflects the confusion and anxiety within the North Atlantic aggressive bloc caused by the failure to complete the war preparation plan. According to the "New York Herald Tribune," "The United States and France have quarreled over the issue of US aid distribution, resulting in mutual animosity. The United States' refusal to hold a North Atlantic Alliance Council meeting before the presidential election has caused unease among the French and some other European governments."

The incurable crisis within the North Atlantic aggressive bloc has caused great panic among the American ruling groups. They are worried about their servants' rule over the people of Western Europe, and they are also worried about their own control over their Western European servants. Regarding these two points, Agence France-Presse said: "American reporters stationed in Italy, Britain, France, and Belgium are now expressing greater anxiety, fearing that these countries will collapse under heavy pressure." The Associated Press said: "...The United States' leadership role in the great alliance against communism has been temporarily weakened. The power of U.S. diplomats to persuade leaders of other governments to make extraordinary decisions for the benefit of the entire alliance has also been limited."

### 美官方人士承认西欧备战计划遭受挫折

    美官方人士承认西欧备战计划遭受挫折
    【本报讯】综合消息：在英国政府宣布延缓扩军计划，法国表示无力完成扩军计划以后，美国官方人士也公开承认，北大西洋集团备战计划业已遭到严重挫折。美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷十日在哥伦比亚广播公司发表演说称：北大西洋公约国家将不能达到在今年建立五十师以及到一九五四年建立九十六师到九十八师的目标。国新社巴黎十日电说：“李奇微总部的要员向国新社记者透露，他们不相信到一九五二年底能够得到三十五师或四十师以上的军队（包括装备恶劣的后备部队在内）和一千五百架以上的飞机。”“盟国高级军官预言：大西洋公约防御计划一九五二年的目标将差十个到十五个师和两千五百架作战飞机不能完成。”今年二月间美国曾经化了很大力气迫使北大西洋集团理事会里斯本会议通过在今年年底建立五十师的计划，但在五个月的现实考验中碰了壁。
    北大西洋各国扩军之所以不能完成计划，主要是由于这些国家发生了严重的经济危机。英国首相邱吉尔在宣布削减扩军计划时曾说，必须减少军备生产，增加出口生产，俾使英国免于破产。法国在得不到美国所承诺的美元军火订单以后，也已在计划削减扩军经费，以挽救法国财政破产的危机。其他西欧国家的经济情况也是同样严重的。美联社的电讯承认，西欧各国经济危机的发展已“远远超过了李奇微将军建立其西欧军的速度”。
    面对着备战计划的危机，美国与其西欧仆从国家之间互相埋怨。合众社说：“欧洲方面人士认为（扩军）计划迟延的原因应该归咎于美国迟迟不交付它所答应给予的军火并削减军事援助。美国人士说：欧洲人如果照他们所答应的那样作最大限度的努力的话，他们就可以做得更好些。”这反映出北大西洋侵略集团内部已因备战计划的不能完成而显出混乱和不安。据“纽约先驱论坛报”称，“美、法两国因美援分配问题发生争吵，以致彼此反目。美国拒绝在总统选举以前举行北大西洋联盟理事会会议，法国与欧洲其他某些国家的政府对这件事感到不安。”
    北大西洋侵略集团内部不可救药的危机已经在美国统治集团中引起极大的惊慌。他们为他们的仆从们对西欧人民的统治担心，他们也为自己对西欧仆从们的控制担心。关于这两点，法新社说：“美国驻意大利、英国、法国和比利时的记者现在都更焦灼地表示不安，他们害怕这些国家会因重压而垮台。”美联社说：“……美国在对付共产主义的伟大联盟中的领导作用已暂时削弱了。美国外交人员劝说其他政府的领袖为了整个联盟的利益而作出不同寻常的决定的力量也受到了限制。”
