Dear leaders and comrades of the People's Liberation Army, dear compatriots across the country:

I am Zhang Jihui, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force. This time, I was invited from the Korean front to return to the country to visit the sports meet of the People's Liberation Army celebrating the 25th anniversary of "August 1st" Army Day. I feel particularly honored and excited. This is the first time in my life that I have felt so happy and joyful. I love Beijing as much as the Soviet people love Moscow, because this is the heart of our great motherland and the place where our great leader Chairman Mao is. Not long ago, I happened to pass through Tianjin on business. I stopped the car for a few hours. In order to see Tiananmen Square where Chairman Mao inspected our great strength, I specially bought a ticket to Beijing, watched Tiananmen Square for a few minutes, and then took the car back to the front. This time, when the train of our Volunteer Army delegation arrived at the Beijing Railway Station, the people from all walks of life in the beloved capital of the motherland were there to warmly welcome us. The military band played the majestic Chinese People's Volunteer Army battle song, colorful flags fluttered, and the voices of "Long Live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" and "Long Live Chairman Mao!" resounded throughout the station. As soon as our team was organized, a group of children lined up and ran to offer us flowers. A little girl, when giving me flowers, hugged me tightly, kissed me. Due to excessive excitement and tension, she could hardly breathe. She said, "Volunteer Army Uncle, you have worked hard, you are finally back!" She was so moved that her eyes contained happy tears. I was extremely moved at the time, and I also hugged her tightly. I couldn't hear many of the words she said clearly. A group of young people and students also rushed up and surrounded me, lifting several of us up high. I was lifted up several times, which moved me so much that I almost forgot myself. My feelings and everyone's feelings have merged together, emitting a resonant cry. So we shouted together: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live the Volunteer Army!". At this moment, I thought of the situation of our fighting on the Korean front. I thought this was Beijing where Chairman Mao lived. The love of the people of the motherland for us moved me too much. I felt that this was the greatest honor in my life. I felt that this was not just love for me alone, but love for the entire Volunteer Army, and love for Chairman Mao.

After I shot down the American so-called jet ace pilot George Davis, I first received many congratulatory letters and telegrams from leaders and comrades at all levels of the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army. Subsequently, the higher-level leaders announced that the Volunteer Army leading organ specially awarded me the title of "Special Class Hero" and issued a notice to the entire army for commendation. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea also awarded me a military medal. At the award ceremony, the leaders spoke, also commending me and encouraging me to better improve my technical tactics and strike the enemy more heavily. After the news of my shooting down Davis was announced in the newspapers, congratulatory letters from the people of the motherland flew in from all places and corners like snowflakes (from Northeast to Northwest, from Guangzhou to Inner Mongolia, including those from organs, factories, schools, troops, and rural areas). I have received over seven hundred letters so far. All these letters moved me infinitely. Because of the tense and busy nature of my combat work, I did not have time to reply to each one. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades, compatriots, and children who sent letters here. Your letters are encouraging me to strive for greater victories.

I used the time between battles to read these letters one by one. Excessive excitement and emotion sometimes made me repeatedly read those passionate and expectant sentences until late at night. When I read that the leaders, comrades, and people of the motherland were cheering for the victory of our young Volunteer Air Force and expecting us to strike the American air pirates more heavily, I deeply felt the glory and importance of the task we shoulder standing at the forefront of opposing American aggression and defending world peace. From the letters of the people of the motherland, I saw the hearts of the people of the motherland. All the children from Class 6 of the second grade of Donggong Street Elementary School in Beijing sent me a notebook on "June 1st" International Children's Day. The letter, signed with the names of all the children, said: "With your and the Volunteer Army Uncles' fighting, we can live happily in the happy motherland. We hope you shoot down more American planes and record your battle deeds in this notebook so that we can listen to them when we meet in the future." I thought this was not only the children's expectation of me, but also the fervent feelings of the people of the motherland and all peace-loving people in the world. At that time, I thought: Dear people of the motherland! We must live up to your earnest expectations and create greater victories to repay the people of the motherland.

A child in Guizhou wrote to me saying: I am sending you my favorite red scarf, which is a corner of the national flag. Let it flutter on your chest and order you to bravely advance. Yuan Zili, a little brother from Beijing No. 5 Middle School, also enclosed a photo of himself in the letter he sent me. He said: He wants me to be his brother, and he wants to learn from me and become a people's air force pilot when he grows up. A young comrade in Shanghai saved his allowance and sent me a subscription to a magazine. Dai Yuefang, a comrade from Peking University, wrote to me saying that she saw Chairman Mao and the Volunteer Army returning delegation, and she is determined to be a good daughter of Chairman Mao. All these congratulatory telegrams and letters expressed the most fervent wishes of the leaders, comrades of the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army as well as the people of the motherland to us, giving me the greatest encouragement and infinite strength. The support of the people of the motherland is an important source of strength for us to defeat the American air pirates. Once last year when I returned to the motherland, I wanted to inquire about a place at the station. After several worker comrades knew that I was a Volunteer Army Air Force soldier, they immediately enthusiastically asked for me. When I thanked them, one of them asked me, have those planes we donated arrived at the Korean front yet? Before I could answer, another comrade excitedly added, "Our Shandong alone donated an air force division!" These few words of the worker comrades kept turning over in my mind. After I returned to the front, I told this news to my comrades, and everyone excitedly said to me: We must use victory to repay the concern of the people of the motherland.

When I learned that I had shot down the American air pirate jet ace pilot Davis, I was also particularly happy. From that time on, I often thought in my mind, how could a child from an ordinary peasant family like me progress to become a people's air force soldier like today and make some contributions to the cause of defending the motherland and defending peace? I think this is also a question that everyone cares about.

When I started learning about the Air Force, I wanted to be an excellent fighter pilot, a good soldier of Mao Zedong. Through the cultivation of the Party and my own efforts, I overcame many hardships and difficulties in my studies. Through hard study and hard training, I gradually mastered flying skills.

When the flames of American imperialism's aggression burned to the Yalu River, I resolutely joined the Volunteer Army at the call of the motherland. Flying to the front line of resisting America and aiding Korea, we know that the planes we are driving are donated by the people of the motherland, and they are the blood and sweat of the people of the motherland. I must take good care of these weapons and give the American aggressors a heavy blow. Every time we drive the planes donated by the people of the motherland and fly to the war zone, we feel that the hearts of the 500 million people of the motherland are looking forward to us bringing them victory. Therefore, we have greater strength to defeat the invading American air pirates.

The disaster that the American robbers brought to the Korean people strengthened my hatred for American imperialism. All comrades who fly over Korea will realize that Korea is indeed a place with beautiful mountains and rivers, but the American robbers destroyed the peaceful and happy life of the Korean people. When we fly in combat over Korea, we see that the cities and villages of Korea have become scorched earth and piles of rubble. When we searched for the enemy in the air, we sometimes clearly saw the smoke after the bombs that the enemy had just dropped exploded. We know that in this short period of time, countless children will lose their mothers, and many mothers will lose their beloved children. At this time, I think of our motherland's beautiful cities and villages, and I also think that our fighting the enemy here is directly defending the happy lives of our own mothers and fathers and millions of children, and is defending our motherland's cities and villages from being bombed, and is defending the sacred territory of the motherland, the peaceful people, and all peace-loving mankind.

When we heard that the army comrades were being bombed and strafed by enemy planes, we urgently requested to sortie, wishing to immediately fly the planes to strike the crazy air pirates.

All the staff and maintenance comrades gave me great encouragement, which moved me very much. They worked in the freezing cold of minus 30 or 40 degrees Celsius, and in the case that their hands would stick to the plane as soon as they touched it, they enthusiastically and actively made all preparations for take-off. They did not care about their frozen and rotten hands. All of them were for winning the air battle, and they all looked forward to my flying into the sky to shoot down American planes.

My shooting down Davis and all the enemy planes were achieved under the direct coordination and cover of my close comrades-in-arms, and were the result of the help and education of higher-level leaders and all comrades at all times. Today, I have received such honor, which should first of all be attributed to the education and training of the Party and Chairman Mao, to the encouragement and support of the people of the motherland, and to the help and education of higher-level leaders and all comrades.

In air combat, I have always been determined to defeat the enemy. In peacetime and on combat duty, I often think of the great heroic figures and the sacrificed beloved comrades-in-arms, such as Comrades Dong Cunrui and Liu Hulan. Although they are dead, the people will always remember them, and the people will always call them heroes. I have infinite respect for them. Once in an air battle, after a very fierce battle, the shells were used up, and the oil was running out. At this time, my situation was quite bad, and enemy planes were chasing behind. At that time, after five or six minutes of fighting, I immediately thought: Simply not being afraid of death is not a great person. I must be determined to find an opportunity to collide with the enemy. Finally, I found the opportunity to collide, and I was getting closer and closer to the enemy. I could almost see the figure of the enemy. Obviously, the enemy did not have such courage. And he panicked and turned down, and crashed into the mountain due to the low altitude and died. This time was not only a victory in action, but also a victory in will. I thought about why I could defeat the enemy. The main reason is that Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland gave me courage and strength. The love of the people of the motherland for me far exceeds my contribution to the motherland.

On the occasion of commemorating the 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the All-Army "August 1st" Sports Games are being held, which not only strengthens physical exercise, but also cultivates excellent qualities of bravery, perseverance, agility, tenacity, and collectivism. At the same time, this conference is a great demonstration to American imperialism. I know that the motherland's national defense army is moving towards regularization and modernization. I will visit this sports meeting and learn well from the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, and then pass it on to the air force comrades of the Volunteer Army after I go back. If American imperialism still frantically carries out sabotage of the armistice negotiations, we resolutely swear: We must follow the instructions of higher-level leaders and the expectations of comrades and the people of the motherland: better improve our technical tactics, strengthen our combat will, and fight more bravely with my comrades in the Korean front, severely strike the American air pirates, and contribute all our strength to the motherland, to the Korean people, and to defending world lasting peace, to create new victories, and to respond to the enthusiastic concern and love of higher-level leaders and all comrades and the people of the motherland for us.

    创造新的胜利，回答祖国人民的热爱
    中国人民志愿军空军战斗英雄张积慧广播词亲爱的解放军各位首长和同志们，亲爱的全国同胞们：
    我是中国人民志愿军空军战士张积慧。这次由朝鲜前线应邀回国参观解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会，使我感到特别光荣和兴奋，是我有生以来第一次感到这样的愉快和高兴。我热爱北京就好像苏联人民热爱莫斯科一样，因为这是我们伟大祖国的心脏，是我们伟大领袖毛主席所在的地方。不久以前，有一次我有事路过天津，停车几个小时，我为了看看毛主席在那检阅我们伟大力量的天安门，专门买票到北京，在天安门前看了几分钟，又坐车回前方了。这次当我们志愿军代表团的列车到达北京车站时，可爱的祖国首都各界人民，都在那里热烈的迎接我们，军乐队奏着雄壮的中国人民志愿军战歌，五彩旗帜飘扬，“中国人民志愿军万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的声音，响遍了整个车站，当我们的队伍刚一整顿好，一群小朋友们就排成了一大队，跑来向我们献花。一个小女孩子在给我献花时，紧紧地抱着我，亲我，吻我，由于过度的兴奋紧张，她气都喘不出来了，她嘴里说：“志愿军叔叔，你们辛苦了，你们可回来了！”她感动得眼睛含着快乐的眼泪，我当时感动极了，也紧紧地抱着她，她说的很多话也听不清了。一群青年们和学生们也蜂拥般地跑上来把我包围起来，把我们几个人都高高地抬起来了，我被抬了好几次，这使我感动得几乎忘了自己，我和大家的感情已融合在一起，发出了共鸣的呼声，于是我们就一同喊出了：“毛主席万岁！”“志愿军万岁！”。这个时候，我想起了我们在朝鲜前线作战的情形，我想到这就是毛主席住的北京，祖国人民对我们的热爱使我太感动了，我感到这是我有生以来最大的光荣，我感到这不是对我一个人的热爱，这是对全体志愿军的热爱，是对毛主席的热爱。
    在我击毙了美国所谓喷气机王牌驾驶员乔治·戴维斯以后，首先接到了志愿军、解放军各级首长和战友们的许多贺信、贺电，随后上级首长又宣布志愿军领导机关特授予我“特等功臣”称号，并通报全军表扬；朝鲜民主主义人民共和国又授予我军功章，在授奖大会上首长讲话时，也是嘉奖我、鼓励我，要我更好地提高技术战术，更沉重地打击敌人。当我打掉戴维斯的消息在报上宣布以后，祖国人民的贺信，又从各个地方、各个角落像雪片一般地飞来（从东北到西北，从广州到内蒙，包括机关的、工厂的、学校的、部队的、农村的），前后我已收到了七百多封来信。所有这些来信使我无限的感动，因为我战斗工作的紧张的繁忙，没有时间一一回信，谨在这里向所有来信的同志们、同胞们和小朋友们致以衷心的感谢。你们的来信，鼓励着我争取更大的胜利。
    我利用战斗空隙的时间一封一封地看了这些来信，过度的兴奋和激动使我有时直到深夜还在反覆阅读那充满热情和期望的语句，当我读到各位首长们、同志们和祖国人民为我们年青志愿空军的胜利而欢呼，以及期望我们更沉重地打击美国空中强盗的时候，我深深感觉到：站在反对美国侵略，保卫世界和平最前线的我们所担负任务的光荣和重大。从祖国人民的来信上就看到了祖国人民的心。北京东公街小学二年级六班全体小朋友们在“六一”国际儿童节的时候，给我寄来了一本笔记本，在签满了小朋友们名字的信上，这样说：“有了你们和志愿陆军叔叔们的战斗，我们可以在幸福的祖国愉快地生活了。我们希望你多多打下美国飞机将你的战斗事迹都记在这个本子上，将来见面的时候读给我们听。”我想这不仅是孩子们对我的期望，也是祖国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈的心情。那时我想：亲爱的祖国人民啊！我们一定不辜负你们的殷切期望，一定要创造更大的胜利来回答祖国人民。
    贵州有一位小朋友给我来信说：把我最喜爱的红领巾寄给你，那是国旗上的一角让她飘扬在你的胸前，让他命令你勇敢前进。北京第五中学袁自立小弟弟寄给我的信里还装着他一张照片，他说：要我作他的哥哥，他要向我学习，长大了也要当人民空军。上海有一个青年同志把自己的津贴节省下来，捎给我订杂志。北京大学戴月芳同志给我来信说：她看到了毛主席和志愿军归国代表团，她坚决作毛主席的好儿女。所有这些贺电和信件表达了志愿军和解放军的首长们、同志们以及祖国人民对我们最热烈的愿望，给了我最大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。祖国人民的支援是我们战胜美国空中强盗重要力量的源泉。我去年有一次回到祖国的时候，在车站上要打听一个去处，几位工人同志知道我是志愿军空军战士以后，立刻热情地替我问到了。当我向他们致谢的时候，他们中间的一个这样问我，咱们捐献的那些飞机都到了朝鲜前线没有，还没有等我回答，另一个同志就兴奋地添了一句：“光咱们山东就捐了一个空军师哩！”工人同志们的这几句话一直在我脑子里不时的在翻转着，当我回到前线以后，我把这个消息告诉了战友们，大家都激动地和我说：我们一定要用胜利来回答祖国人民的关怀。
    当我知道了我击落美国空中强盗喷气机王牌驾驶员戴维斯的时候，我也特别高兴，从那时起我脑子里经常想，像我这样一个普通农民家庭出身的孩子，怎么进步到成为今天这样一个人民空军战士，能在保卫祖国，保卫和平的事业上作出一些贡献？我想，这也是大家所关心的一个问题。
    当我开始学空军的时候，我就想将来要作一个优秀的驱逐机驾驶员，作一个毛泽东的好战士，经过党的培养和我自己的努力，使我在学习中克服了许多艰苦困难，经过了苦学苦练使我逐渐掌握了飞行技术。
    当美帝国主义侵略的火焰烧向鸭绿江的时候，在祖国的召唤下我奋然参加了志愿军。飞到了抗美援朝的最前线，我们知道我们驾驶的飞机，是祖国人民捐献的，是祖国人民的血汗，我一定要好好爱护这些武器，狠狠地给美国侵略者以沉重的打击，每当我们驾驶着祖国人民捐献的飞机，飞向战区的时候，我们就感到五万万祖国人民的心，在盼望着我们带给他们胜利，因而，我们就有了更大的力量，打败来侵犯的美国空中强盗。
    美国强盗带给朝鲜人民的灾难使我更加强了对美帝国主义的仇恨心，凡是飞行在朝鲜上空的同志都会体会出来，朝鲜的确是一个山青水秀的地方，可是美国强盗破坏了朝鲜人民和平幸福的生活；当我们在朝鲜上空战斗飞行的时候，却看见朝鲜城市和乡村，都变成了一片焦土成了瓦砾堆。我们在空中搜索敌人的时候，有时很清楚的看到敌人刚投下的炸弹爆炸后的烟雾。我们知道在这短短的时间里，无数孩子将失去他们的母亲，也将有许多的母亲失去他心爱的孩子，这时使我就连想到我们祖国美丽的城市和乡村，也想到我们在这里打击敌人，就是直接保卫我们自己的母亲和父亲和千百万的孩子的幸福生活，就是保卫我们祖国的城市和乡村不受轰炸，就是保卫祖国神圣的领土，和平的人民以及所有爱好和平的人类。
    当我们听到陆军同志们受到敌机轰炸、扫射的时候，我们就迫切地要求出击，恨不得马上驾驶飞机去打击疯狂的空中强盗。
    所有的工作人员和机务工作同志，他们都给我很大的鼓励，使我很受感动，他们都在零下三、四十度的冰天雪地里工作，在手一摸到飞机就要黏到飞机上的情况下，热心积极地为起飞作好一切准备，手都冻烂了也毫不顾惜，他们都为的是取得空战胜利，都盼望着我飞到天空打掉美国飞机。
    我击落戴维斯和所有的敌机，都是在亲密的战友们直接协同掩护下取得的，是上级首长和全体同志们时时刻刻帮助教育所得来的。今天我得到了这样的荣誉，应该首先归功于党和毛主席对我的教育和培养，归功于祖国人民对我的鼓励和支持，归功于上级以及全体同志们对我的帮助和教育。
    在空战中，我从来都是抱定坚决战胜敌人的信心，在平常和战斗值班时常想起伟大的英雄人物和牺牲的亲爱战友，就像董存瑞和刘胡兰同志那样，他们虽然死了，可是人民永远纪念着他们，人民永远称他们是英雄，我对他们是无比的敬爱。有一次空战中经过非常激烈的战斗以后，炮弹打光了，油也快完了，可是这时我的处境相当恶劣，后边有敌机追着，当时我经过五、六分钟的搏斗，我就立时想起：单纯不怕死不是伟大的人，我要决心找机会和敌人相撞，终于我找到了相撞机会，和敌人越来越近，人影都快看着了，显然敌人是没有这样勇敢精神的，而他惊慌地倒转了下去，因高度低而撞至山上毙命了。这一次不仅是动作上的胜利，而且也是意志上的胜利。我想为什么能战胜敌人，主要的就是毛主席和祖国人民给了我勇敢和力量。祖国人民对我的热爱远远超过了我对祖国的贡献。
    当此纪念祖国人民解放军的“八一”建军节二十五周年的时候，举行全军“八一”运动大会，它不但加强体格锻炼，而且要养成勇敢、坚毅、机敏、顽强、集体主义的优良品质，同时这次大会是向美帝国主义的大示威。我知道，祖国的国防军正在走向正规化和现代化，我参观这次运动大会，要好好地向解放军同志们学习，回去以后好传达给志愿军的空军同志们。假如美帝国主义仍旧疯狂进行破坏停战谈判的话，我们坚决宣誓：一定要按照上级首长的指示和同志们、祖国人民的来信期望的那样：更好地提高技术战术，加强战斗意志，和我的战友们一道更加勇敢地战斗在朝鲜前线，狠狠地打击美国空中强盗，为祖国、为朝鲜人民、为保卫世界持久和平而贡献所有的力量，来创造新的胜利，回答上级首长及全体同志们和祖国人民对我们的热烈关怀和爱戴。（新华社）
