One day, as dusk deepened and the sky grew dark, two reconnaissance squads of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army appeared on the mountain road, their figures indistinct. Staff Officer Yin led the way, followed closely by the liaison officer. Squad Leader Han Qifa of the Seventh Squad, a tall man, walked vigorously, while Wu Weihe, shorter in stature, rapidly moved his legs back and forth to keep up. The heroes, their feet sinking into snowdrifts, followed closely, sweat soaking through their clothes like rain. Comrade, if you ask where these heroes are going, listen as I tell you the whole story from beginning to end.

After the Third Campaign broke through the 38th parallel, we advanced victoriously to the Han River. MacArthur suffered three consecutive defeats, and we completely shattered his frantic arrogance. He was beaten black and blue, his mind in a panic, panting for breath, restless day and night. As he fled, he turned his head to look, and thought, "Eh! The Volunteer Army isn't chasing my tail? Why don't I grit my teeth and turn back, so I can save face in the United Nations?" With the treacherous heart and胆敢 of a dog, he harbored妄想, and thus continuously sent reconnaissance troops to Lichuan.

Our wise leaders were able to make a judgement, knowing that the enemy was up to no good again. In order to thoroughly understand the enemy's tricks, it was necessary to infiltrate deep behind enemy lines and capture a鬼子 officer to understand the overall plan. The command issued an order, assigning the task to two squads of the reconnaissance company. Therefore, the heroes braved the wind and snow to hurry on their way, not fearing to cross mountains and ridges in the dark night. The northwest wind was like a small knife, specifically刮脸, and the breath froze into琉璃团 on their eyebrows. Uphill, they had to grab onto thorny bushes; downhill, it felt like riding a rake, sliding down with a "哧溜" sound. It was only because the comrades had a strong determination to complete the task that they did not fear even the highest mountains. They quickly climbed over the mountains and ridges, climbing in one breath to the summit of Five Hundred and Eighty Meter Peak. At this time, the wind stopped and the clouds dispersed, but only a patch of bright white light was visible outside the pine forest; Han Qifa carefully looked over the mountain ridge, and was startled! Large and small electric lights encircled the mountaintop. Staff Officer Yin and Han Qifa secretly rejoiced, they estimated that this nearby area must be an important organ of the enemy's advance troops; The American鬼子 were afraid of the Korean guerrillas, so they made it so brightly lit to ensure safety. This is what is called贼人心虚胆子小, Humph! American鬼子, you've miscalculated, not only did you not block the Korean guerrillas, but increasing the target area conveniently aided the reconnaissance members. Seventh Squad Leader Han Qifa saw a large road below the mountain, leading south to Daegu and north to Lichuan, and upon closer inspection to the south, there was a large village from which several telephone wires stretched out. At this time, he heard a "嗡隆嗡隆" sound coming from the village, "Ya! What kind of机关 is this?" Some said it was the enemy's night flight; others said it seemed like the enemy's vehicles were about to move. Staff Officer Yin listened carefully and disagreed, he judged that it was the enemy's radio; thinking of this, he immediately ordered the Seventh Squad Leader: (Spoken) "Seventh Squad Leader." "Present!" "We will deploy forces outside the village to provide cover, you take a group and quickly enter the village without delay, you must capture a living officer, and the time must not exceed half past two." Han Qifa, upon hearing this, quickly prepared, and took two people, dividing into two groups to approach the village.

The reconnaissance members approached the village, and without mentioning it, let's talk about the enemy's sentry, named "奥地安". He suffered from a condition where every sound was a possible threat, and his legs trembled at the sound of gunfire. The daytime was still bearable, but he feared the dark nights; he feared the dark shadows of the large trees on the mountain, which seemed to move the more he stared. He feared the north wind blowing through the electric wires, which made him feel numb and his heart sore! If a sound were to come out of nowhere, it would scare him into a cold sweat. Tonight, it happened to be his turn to stand guard, and he muttered, shivering: He muttered about Truman, you shouldn't have sent troops to fight in Korea, across the sea, how did the Korean people bother us? He muttered about Truman, he shouldn't have dragged him to the front line, so his family could not be reunited. He muttered about standing guard in the middle of the night, enduring the cold and fear alone, Truman, if you want to fight, fight yourself! Here's a rifle for you, you stand guard; if the guerrillas come, I'll secretly take a "health pill" first. The more he thought about it, the more afraid he became, he felt his hair standing on end, his spine cold, as if a large centipede had crawled up it. He coldly looked into the distance: "Eh! The tree trunks by the side of the road are moving again, the more I say they are moving, the more they move, in the past I was just imagining things because I was timid, how come today the tree trunks are still moving forward?" He strengthened his courage, loaded his gun, and just as he opened his throat to shout, Han Qifa was truly resourceful and brave, having already circled behind him, snatching the gun with his left hand and blocking the 鬼子's mouth with his right. This 鬼子 felt uncomfortable all over, (Spoken) How could he be comfortable! He hurriedly dropped the carbine to the ground, dumbfounded, unable to speak. Han Qifa asked: "Where do your officers live?" Wang Desheng blocked the 鬼子's chest with a submachine gun. The 鬼子 didn't know what was happening, desperately begging to God, frantically making the sign of the cross all over his body. Han Qifa thought, "That's right, he doesn't understand Chinese, let me try gesturing to him." First, he patted his shoulder to indicate his rank, then gestured to a pistol and belt, and the 鬼子 understood, pointing with his hand to the inside. Han Qifa saw a small jeep at the entrance, and quickly called to Wang Desheng, "Quick, take this guy back to the mountain."

He and Wu Weihe did not delay, taking several steps, like a ferocious tiger going down the mountain. They arrived at the front, hid their figures, and listened carefully: "Hey! The sound of telegrams being sent inside the room, '嘀嘀??' rings happily." (Spoken) Peeking through the crack in the door, he saw electric lights inside the room, and two American 鬼子 sitting next to the radio. Looking further inside: a呢子 coat hung at the doorway of the inner room, the gold badges on the shoulders shining brightly. Han Qifa understood at a glance, he judged that there must be an officer in the inner room. He thought, "I'll shoot those two 鬼子 in the outer room, and then capturing the officer won't be difficult," thinking this, he whispered to Wu Weihe, "Do this and that, and that and this," Wu Weihe nodded in agreement, and turned to the back of the house; the 鬼子 inside the room didn't know anything, snoring soundly in his sleep.

This kid was dreaming of good things, dreaming that their America had occupied all of Korea, and proudly walking north, standing at the edge of the Yalu River, looking at China; China has vast land and abundant resources and treasures, this piece of肥肉 is truly tempting, hurry up and enter China, pile up silver into stacks, pile up gold into mountains. At that time, they could arbitrarily do whatever they wanted, and prepare their strength to invade the Soviet Union again. The more this kid thought about it, the more excited he got, the more comfortable he felt on the hot炕头, at this time, Han Qifa had already prepared the grenade, unscrewed the cap, pulled the pin, and kicked the door in half with one foot, throwing it in with a "喀?" sound, a earth-shattering explosion with black smoke. The two 鬼子 in the outer room screamed哇哇, their two little lives were finished. The officer in the room was awakened, his good dream unfinished, he mumbled in his sleep: "Hello! Whose plane is dropping bombs here?" Upon closer listening, he realized something was wrong, why were the soldiers in the outer room screaming! "Oh! Maybe the guerrillas have come, I must run quickly, don't delay!" He scrambled out of bed and ran outside, not even bothering to put on his shoes, if you wanted to run, you should have ran through the door, he stubbornly drilled through the window, the Korean window was small, and the 鬼子 was big, he drilled, hey, just right, half inside and half outside, he couldn't get out and couldn't go back, his head was "不楞" [Note 1] frantically. He hit a nail, causing him to bleed profusely as he rubbed his head and shouted.

Wu Weihe thought to himself, "You've come at the right time, I've been waiting here for you for a long time," he ran forward and grabbed his hair with one hand, and hurriedly blocked his mouth with the other, clamping his neck and dragging him outside, squeezing the small window until it was in disarray. At this time, gunfire rang out all around, Han Qifa said: "Wu Weihe, I'll cover you, quickly take this guy up the mountain"; Wu Weihe pulled the 鬼子 and walked outside, the 鬼子 lay on the ground and didn't move, at this time, the gunfire all around became even more intense, Han Qifa hurriedly carried the 鬼子 on his shoulder, shouting "Wu Weihe, you lift his legs, let's haul him up the mountain," Wu Weihe said "Good, good, good!" The two of them seemed to be carrying a large carrying pole. Just as they reached the hillside, the 鬼子撒泼打滚 and kept shouting, they couldn't hold him down three times in a row, the 鬼子 was afraid of death, and lay on the ground like a corpse, not moving. At this time, Han Qifa didn't delay, he stepped forward and spoke to him with a gentle expression, gesturing as he talked: "The Volunteer Army doesn't kill prisoners, as long as you quickly come with us, we guarantee your life will be safe." He reached out and took out a first-aid kit, bandaging the 鬼子's wound. The 鬼子 felt relieved at once, thinking: "Following them is a way to live, if I try to耍“泥腿” [Note 2], I'll definitely go to hell," he said "OK" [Note 3] and followed them, Han Qifa was truly happy in his heart. He brought the 鬼子 to the predetermined meeting point, and Staff Officer Yin led the troops back into the mountains at dawn, returning to our own position, only to find out that this 鬼子 was an officer in charge of telegrams. The tricks played by the enemy were completely mastered by us, we built strong defensive works; and launched the defensive battle on the south bank of the Han River. Han Qifa victoriously completed the task, and his heroic deeds spread everywhere.

    侦察英雄韩起发（山东快书）
    中国人民志愿军某部战士  刘鹏
    有一天，黄昏已过天色晚，山路上，影影绰绰出现了志愿军的两个侦察班。殷参谋带队头前走，身后边紧跟着联络员。七班长韩起发个大走的猛，吴维和的个子矮，他两腿插上插下紧倒换。英雄们脚踩雪窝紧紧跟着，热汗如雨湿透衣衫。同志，你要问英雄们往那里去？听我从头到尾细说根源。
    三次战役突破三八线，咱们乘胜进到汉江南，麦克阿瑟连续吃了三次败仗，疯狂的气焰叫咱一棒全打完。打得他头破血流惊魂不定，吁吁喘喘日夜不安，他正自逃跑扭头一看，咦！志愿军没跟着我的屁股撵哪？我何不硬着头皮转回去，在联合国里也好转转脸面。他贼心狗胆生妄想，于是就不断派侦察部队到利川。
    咱们英明的首长能判断，知道敌人又在那儿打鬼算盘。为了彻底弄清敌人的鬼把戏，就必须深入敌后抓一个鬼子的军官了解全盘。指挥机关下命令，把任务交给侦察连的两个班，因此上，英雄们顶着风雪来赶路，那怕翻山越岭在夜黑天。西北风像小刀子专刮脸，呵气霜雪挂在眼眉上冻成琉璃团，上坡得搬着刺棵子；下坡好像坐着耙犁哧溜一声下了山。只因为同志们完成任务的决心大，那怕它高山高上天。翻山越岭走的快，一股劲爬上了五百八十公尺的顶盖山。这时间风也停来云也散，但只见松林外边白亮亮的光一片；韩起发翻过山岭留神看，吓！大小电灯在山头上围了一个圈。殷参谋、韩起发二人心暗喜，他们估计这附近一定是敌人先头部队的重要机关；美国鬼子害怕朝鲜游击队，才弄得这样亮堂堂的图安全。这才叫贼人心虚胆子小，哼！美国鬼子你错打算盘，不但没挡住朝鲜游击队，增大目标倒给侦察员添了方便。七班长韩起发见山下有一条大公路，往南通大邱、往北通利川，再仔细往南看有一个大村庄，从村里拉出了几根电话线。这时间听见村子里边嗡隆嗡隆响，呀！这是搞的啥机关？有的说这是敌人的夜班飞机；有的说好像是敌人的汽车要动弹。殷参谋细听全不对，他判断这是敌人的无线电；想到这里他马上命令七班长：（白）“七班长”。“有！”“我们在村外边布置兵力作掩护，你带着一个组迅速进村别怠慢，要抓住一个活军官，时间不能超过两点半。”韩起发闻听忙准备，带着两个人分成两路靠近村庄前。
    侦察员靠近村庄且不表，再说敌人的哨兵名叫
    “奥地安”。他害了草木皆兵的吃惊病，听见枪响腿肚子发颤颤。白天的日子还好过，就怕下晚夜黑头天；他害怕山上大树那一堆黑影，怎么越瞅越动弹？他害怕北风刮电线，叫的他混身发麻心发酸！要是那里冷个仃的出个响声，吓的他混身冒汗打寒颤。今夜晚正赶上他站岗，哆哩哆嗦直叨念：他叨念杜鲁门，你不该发兵打朝鲜，隔着大海朝鲜人民那点碍着咱？他叨念杜鲁门，不该拉他上前线，一家老少不团圆。他叨念半夜三更站大岗，挨冻受怕一人担，杜鲁门，愿意打仗你自己打吧！给你发棵步枪你站站；要是来了游击队，抽冷子我得先吃“卫生丸”。他越思越想越害怕，只觉着头发根发悚、脊梁骨冰凉、活像爬上来一条大蚰蜒。他冷眼往远处一看：咦！道旁的树棵子又直动弹，说动弹他越动弹，往日里是我心虚胆小看花眼，怎么今天树棵子还往前搬？他强壮着胆子，把枪顶上了火，扯开了嗓子刚要喊，韩起发真是机动又勇敢，早绕到了他身后边，左手夺枪右手把鬼子嘴堵严。这个鬼子觉着混身不舒坦，（白）那还能舒坦啦！忙把卡宾枪撂下地，目瞪口呆发不了言。韩起发问：你们军官在那里住？王德胜把冲锋枪堵在鬼子的胸前。鬼子不知这是怎么回事呀，一个劲的哀告上帝，混身上下忙忙乎乎把十字架划个欢。韩起发一想，对呀，中国话他不懂，我跟他比划比划试试看。先拍肩膀比肩牌，又比划手枪和皮带，这个鬼子明白啦，用手一指在里边。韩起发一看门口有辆小吉普，忙叫王德胜，快把这个家伙带回山。
    他跟吴维和不怠慢，几个箭步，好似猛虎下了山。来到跟前、荫蔽身形、侧耳一听：嘿！屋子里发电报的声音嘀嘀??响的欢。（白）顺着门缝往里一看，屋里安着电灯，有两个美国鬼子坐在报话机旁边。又往里看：里屋门口挂着一件呢子大衣，肩膀上的金牌明光闪闪。韩起发一看明白了，他判断里屋一定有军官。他想我打死外屋这两个鬼子，再抓军官不费难，想到这附耳告诉吴维和，这般如此、如此这般，吴维和听罢点点头，转身到了房后边；屋里这个鬼子一点也不知道哇，呼噜呼噜睡的正甜。
    这小子作梦想好事，梦见他们美国占领了全朝鲜，得意洋洋往北走，站在鸭绿江边把中国看；中国地大物博财宝多，这块肥肉可真眼馋，赶紧快把中国进，银子堆成垛、金子堆成山。到那时横行霸道随意胡干，准备好力量再进攻苏联。这小子越想越带劲，热炕头越烙越舒坦，说时迟来那时快，这时候，韩起发已准备好了手榴弹，拧开盖，拉住弦，一脚把屋门踹成两半，“喀?”一声掷进去，惊天动地冒黑烟。炸的外屋那两个鬼子哇哇叫，两条小命完了蛋。惊醒屋里那个军官，他的好梦没作完，他稀里糊涂说梦话：哈啰！那里的飞机往我这里扔炸弹？仔细一听不对劲，为什么外屋的士兵直叫唤！噢！大概是来了游击队，我得快跑别迟延！钻出被子就往外边跑，连鞋子都没顾得穿，要跑你可打门上跑哇，他硬从窗户往外钻，朝鲜的窗户小、鬼子个又大，他一钻，嘿，正合适、里一半来外一半，他出不来也回不去，脑袋使劲“不楞”〔注一〕的欢。一下子碰在钉子上，碰的他鲜血直流抚着脑袋光叫唤。
    吴维和暗说你来的好，我在这里等你老半天，跑上前一手抓住头发，一手忙把嘴堵严，夹住脖子就往外边搬，在小窗里拖出来，把小窗户挤的稀糊烂。这时四周枪声响，韩起发说：吴维和我掩护你，快把这个家伙带上山；吴维和拉着鬼子往外走，鬼子躺在地下不动弹，这时四周枪声更激烈，韩起发忙把鬼子背在肩，叫声吴维和你抬着腿，咱俩把他整上山，吴维和说声好、好、好！两人好像抬着一条大扁担。刚刚走到山坡上，鬼子撒泼打滚直叫唤，三把两把没搂住，鬼子摔在地上边，左拉右扯他不走，鬼子怕死、像块死肉躺在地上不动弹。这时间韩起发不怠慢，走向前和颜悦色比比划划向他谈：“志愿军这个杀头的没有，只要你赶快跟我们走，保险你生命得安全。”伸手取出救急包，把鬼子伤口包扎完。鬼子一见心有底啦，心想：跟着走是活路，要耍“泥腿”〔注二〕一定得进鬼门关，说了声“OK”〔注三〕跟着走，韩起发心里真喜欢。把鬼子带到预定的集合点，殷参谋带着队伍趁着拂晓翻进了山，回到咱们的阵地上，才知道这个鬼子是管电报的一个军官。敌人耍的鬼把戏，叫咱完全掌握在手中间，咱们构筑了坚强的防御工事；展开了汉江南岸的守备战。韩起发胜利圆满完成任务，英雄事迹到处传。
    〔注一〕摇摆的意思。
    〔注二〕即耍赖皮。
    〔注三〕即“好”的意思。
    按：这个演唱获得“八一”建军节体育运动大会
