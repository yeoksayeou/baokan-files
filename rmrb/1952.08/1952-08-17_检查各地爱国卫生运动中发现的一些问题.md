In order to urge and assist various regions in carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign, the central health departments successively sent inspection teams to major administrative regions for inspection. The teams to North China, Northwest China, Northeast China, and Southwest China inspected a total of 1,106 units, including rural areas, factories, schools, hospitals, street residential areas, enterprise departments, government agencies, and troops, in Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, Guisui, Baotou, Taiyuan, Yangquan, Anyang, Puyang, Heze, Xinxiang, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Qinhuangdao in North China; Xi'an, Lanzhou, Weinan, and Lantian in Northwest China; Shenyang, Dalian, Fushun, Anshan, Benxi, Andong, Yingkou, Jilin, Yanji, Tumen, Mudanjiang, Harbin, Qiqihar, Siping, Changchun, Jinzhou, Baichengzi, Kuandian, and Kaitong in Northeast China; and Chongqing, Beibei, Bishan, Qingmuguan, Dali, and Eryuan in Yunnan Province in Southwest China.

The inspection teams saw many places where sanitation and cleaning were done very well. These places were roughly: 1. Urban residential areas and rural areas where the masses were mobilized through propaganda and education; 2. Organs, troops, and factories where the leaders attached importance to sanitation work; 3. Corners where sanitation work was the worst and most "famous" in the past, but now have attracted attention. For example, in Liulin Village in Pingyuan Province, sanitation work was relatively good in the past. Cleaning and sweeping in the village has become a regular job, and a "responsibility system" has been implemented by designating cleaning areas. The peasants themselves have built bathhouses and nurseries, and the whole village is very clean. No infectious diseases have occurred in the past few years. Xiaodongzhuang and Shandongzhuang in Qinhuangdao City are areas where poor people live. The houses are small and dense, and the sanitation situation was the worst in the past. This time, the district government mobilized the masses to carry out a large-scale cleanup, filling in the stinking ditches and turning them into wide roads. Now every household is clean, and flies are almost extinct. Facts have proved that the people have the enthusiasm and strength to do a good job in sanitation work, as long as the leading organs pay attention to leadership, carry out propaganda, education, and organizational work well, sanitation work can be done well. Since the anti-bacterial warfare and the Patriotic Health Campaign, most leading organs and leading cadres have attached importance to this campaign, and generally have achieved results. The places visited by the inspection teams this time, such as Fushun, Tumen, Harbin, and Kuandian County in Northeast China, Hebei Province in North China, some rural areas in Pingyuan Province, Kangbao County in Chabei, Chongqing City in Southwest China, Xi'an City, Chang'an County and parts of the army in Northwest China, have done relatively well in sanitation work.

The inspection teams also found that sanitation work in many places was still not done well, mostly in organs, mining areas, enterprise departments, and hospitals. Some of these places have not yet been mobilized for the health campaign, some have just "coped" with it, and some still do not move after being urged and inspected. For example, in the Shanxi Provincial People's Government organs, there was garbage everywhere indoors and outdoors, flies breeding in the toilets, rotten meat in the kitchen, and dirty clothes in the dormitories. The streets of Yangquan City were piled with garbage everywhere, the catering industry was not managed, and there were no wells or toilets in the mining areas. Workers drank sewage from river ponds and defecated everywhere. The sanitation conditions of some sanatoriums in Beidaihe, Hebei Province, were terrible, with the sanatoriums of the North China Military Region and Hebei Province being the worst. The newly built buildings of the Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical College were not cleaned properly and were very dirty. Some factories in Northeast China did not pay enough attention to the health of workers, such as the Anshan Machinery Factory, the Huojian Factory and the Paper Mill in Qiqihar. In the railway department of Dalian City, seven kitchens were inspected, and maggots were found in the sauce jars and soy sauce in five of them. Dalian Native Produce Company sold some fish, meat, and fruits that had deteriorated due to poor storage. The slaughterhouse in Shenyang City threw dead pigs in the air-raid shelter, and the stench was unbearable. From this inspection, we can see that the Patriotic Health Campaign in various places still has the following problems that must be resolved:

1. Some leading organs and leading cadres have not paid enough attention to the Patriotic Health Campaign. Some of them do not care about sanitation work; some simply push it to the health department or lower levels; some only make general calls and do not provide specific leadership. For example, the organization in Pingyuan Province that leads the health campaign forgot about an important instruction issued by the higher authorities and only found it during this inspection. Harbin Electric Fourth Factory transferred the higher authorities' instructions on the health campaign layer by layer from the chief engineer to the lower levels, all the way to the cooks for them to read. The cooks threw the document on the kitchen chopping board. The head of the Anshan Public Security Bureau told his subordinates to use only one-eighth of their strength to engage in the health campaign when deploying work. In many places in Northeast China and Hebei Province, the health campaign was pushed to the health department to be carried out alone.

2. The health department's organization is not sound. Some do not actively work through the leadership, but emphasize that the higher authorities do not care; some medical departments have a simple treatment perspective and do not pay attention to the health campaign.

3. In factories and enterprises, some people mistakenly believe that the health campaign conflicts with production. Leaders only see the urgency of production tasks and ignore the health of workers. Some factory leaders do not know how to care for workers. They only know that workers should be given good medical care when they are sick, but do not know that they should do a good job in sanitation and safety work in peacetime to fundamentally protect the health of workers.

4. Some leading cadres underestimate the power of the masses. Some are biased towards pharmaceutical methods and ignore the various methods created by the masses. For example, in cities such as Andong and Jinzhou in Northeast China, after using drugs for disinfection, some people developed the idea of relying on drugs, and the cleaning and sanitation movement was extremely incomplete. Some health agencies and some leaders in Northwest China believe that the cultural and economic conditions of the people in Northwest China are relatively poor, and they are afraid that the health campaign will not be successful. But the fact is not like this. In Xi'an City, the areas where many working people live on the edge of the city and at the station, the health campaign has been done very well, while many organs, schools, and factories with better material conditions have not done well in sanitation work.

In addition, the mutual cooperation of various departments in the movement in some places is not good enough, and the problem of combining the health campaign with other work has not been resolved. Also, some places' sanitation work plans lack specific requirements and cannot be implemented. Some places lack inspection, or inspection cannot promote work. The propaganda work of the health campaign in some places has not been deeply popularized among the masses. Some places have a simple task perspective, such as catching mice and only handing in the specified number, leaving the excess for the next task. Some places have developed complacency and complacency after the movement was launched, causing the movement to stagnate.

In addition to understanding the situation in various places, the inspection teams in various places also helped the local areas to mobilize and arrange the health campaign. Some groups made commendations and criticisms on the spot during the inspection, and some groups had newspaper reporters participate, publishing typical examples in the newspapers, which greatly promoted the sanitation work in various places. Many places have formulated plans to improve sanitation work after the inspection, and the Patriotic Health Campaign has made new progress.

### 检查各地爱国卫生运动中发现的一些问题

    检查各地爱国卫生运动中发现的一些问题
    为了督促与帮助各地开展爱国卫生运动，中央卫生部门曾先后派检查组赴各大行政区进行检查。赴华北、西北、东北、西南的各组，在华北的张家口、宣化、归绥、包头、太原、阳泉、安阳、濮阳、菏泽、新乡、唐山、石家庄、保定、秦皇岛，西北的西安、兰州、渭南、蓝田，东北的沈阳、大连、抚顺、鞍山、本溪、安东、营口、吉林、延吉、图们、牡丹江、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、四平、长春、锦州、白城子、宽甸、开通，西南的重庆、北碚、璧山、青木关、云南省的下关、洱源等地检查了农村、工厂、学校、医院、街巷居民区、企业行业部门、政府机关和部队等共一千一百零六个单位。
    检查组在各地看到了很多卫生清洁工作做得很好的地方。这些地方大致是：一、经过宣传教育，发动了群众的城市居民区和农村；二、首长重视卫生工作的机关、部队、工厂；三、过去卫生工作最坏，最“出名”，而现在引起注意的角落。其中如平原省的柳林村，过去的卫生工作就比较好，村里的清洁打扫已成为经常工作，并划定打扫区域实行“责任制”，农民自己办了澡堂和托儿所，全村都很清洁，几年来没有发生过传染病。秦皇岛市的小东庄和山东庄，是贫苦人民聚居地区，房屋矮小密集，过去卫生情况最坏，这次区政府发动群众进行了大扫除，填平臭水沟变成了大马路，现在家家清洁，苍蝇几乎绝迹。事实证明，人民群众都有做好卫生工作的热情和力量，只要领导机关注意领导，很好地进行宣传教育和组织工作，卫生工作就能做好。各地自进行反细菌战、开展爱国卫生运动以后，大部分领导机关和领导干部都重视这一运动，一般都是有成绩的。这次检查组所到的地方，如东北的抚顺、图们、哈尔滨和宽甸县，华北的河北省，平原省的部分农村，察北的康保县，西南的重庆市，西北的西安市、长安县和部分军队，卫生工作都做得比较好。
    这次检查组也发现了许多地方的卫生工作还做得不好，这些地方大多是机关、工矿区、企业部门和医院。这些地方的卫生运动有的还没有动，有的则“应付”了一下，有的经过督促检查还是不动。如山西省人民政府机关，室内室外到处有垃圾，厕所里生苍蝇，厨房里放着臭肉，宿舍里放着脏衣服。阳泉市街到处堆积垃圾，饮食行业未加管理，工矿区无水井、无厕所，工人吃河池中的污水，到处大便。河北省北戴河有一些疗养院的卫生情况恶劣，其中以华北军区的疗养院与河北省疗养院为最坏。河北医学院附属医院新盖的楼房，不好好打扫，弄得很脏。东北有些工厂对工人的卫生健康未很好注意，如鞍山机械工厂、齐齐哈尔的火硷厂、造纸厂等。在大连市的铁路部门中，检查了七个厨房，其中五处的酱缸、酱油中有蛆。大连市土产公司因货品保管不好，有一些鱼、肉、水果腐败了还拿来出卖。沈阳市的屠宰场，将死猪扔在防空洞里，臭不可当。从这次检查中看到，各地的爱国卫生运动，还有下列这些问题必须解决：
    一、部分领导机关和领导干部，对爱国卫生运动未引起足够的重视。他们有的对卫生工作不过问；有的把它往卫生部门或下级一推了事；有的则只作了一般号召，未进行具体领导。如平原省领导卫生运动的机构，把上级发下去的一个重要指示压下忘掉了，这次检查中才追查出来。哈尔滨电工第四厂把上级关于卫生运动的指示，由总工程师往下层层批转，一直批到炊事员那里传阅，炊事员把文件扔在厨房案板上。鞍山市公安局长在布置工作时叫下面只用八分之一的力量来搞卫生运动。在东北和河北省的许多地方，都把卫生运动推给卫生部门单独去搞。
    二、卫生部门组织不健全，有的自己不主动地通过领导去进行工作，而强调上级不管；有的医疗部门有单纯的治疗观点，不重视卫生运动。
    三、在工厂企业中，有的人错误地以为卫生运动和生产矛盾。领导人只看到生产任务紧要，忽视了工人的健康。有的工厂领导干部不知道怎样去爱护工人，他们只知道工人生了病时要很好地医疗照顾，而不知道应该在平时做好卫生安全工作，从根本上保障工人的健康。
    四、有的领导干部对群众力量估计不足。有的偏重药品办法，而忽视群众创造的各种办法。如东北的安东、锦州等城市用了药物消毒，某些人就滋长了依赖药物的思想，清洁卫生运动做得极不彻底。西北某些卫生机关和某些领导人，认为西北地方人民的文化、经济条件比较差，卫生运动怕搞不起来。但事实并不是这样，西安市的城边、车站许多劳动人民聚居的地方，卫生运动做得很好了，而物质条件较好的许多机关、学校、工厂，卫生工作反而没有做好。
    另外，有的地方在运动中各个部门的互相配合还做得不够好，卫生运动与其他工作互相结合的问题也未解决。还有一些地方订的卫生工作计划缺乏具体的要求，不能贯彻执行。有的地方缺乏检查，或者检查不能推动工作。有的地方卫生运动的宣传工作还没有深入普及到群众中去。有的地方有单纯任务观点，如捉了老鼠只按规定数目交，多的留下等待下次任务。有的地方在运动展开后就发生了麻痹自满情绪，使运动停顿。
    这次各检查组在各地除了解情况外，并帮助当地进行了卫生运动的动员、布置工作。有的组在检查中当场提出表扬和批评，有的组还有报纸的记者参加，将典型事例发表在报纸上，对各地卫生工作起了很大的推动作用。许多地方在检查后已订出改进卫生工作的计划，爱国卫生运动已有新的进展。
