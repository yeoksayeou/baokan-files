    “August 1st” Sports Meet Athletes Implemented the Spirit of "Studying Humbly, Competing to Improve, Uniting and Progressing"
    At the "August 1st" Sports Meet, athletes from all participating teams implemented the spirit of "studying humbly, competing to improve, uniting and progressing" during the competitions and performances, and all made great progress.
    On the sports field, the athletes all maintained an attitude of humbly learning. Liu Yongfu, the first-place winner in the middleweight weightlifting category, saw that the squat snatch posture of Yin Guohua, the lightweight champion, was very good, and mastered the technique after practicing for two days. Yuan Cuiying, the first-place winner in the women's 50-meter freestyle swimming event, noticed that Wu Chuanyu swam freestyle very well, and voluntarily asked him for advice. Although the Northwest Military Region basketball team lost both of their first two games, they were not discouraged. They actively observed the strengths of brotherly teams to improve themselves and put forward the slogan: "One game, one step forward." They finally won in the third game. Although the performance of the Military Academy team in some events was relatively poor, they always actively engaged in learning with full spirit and a humble attitude.
    The athletes fully demonstrated the excellent work style of hard study and hard training of the People's Army on the sports field. Track athlete Yi Taotege came from the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia. Although he was not accustomed to the heat of Beijing, he still practiced with Li Diansheng and others under the scorching sun every day. They won the first and second place respectively in the 5,000-meter race final. The Navy swimming team stipulated a certain training plan, and the athletes completed it according to the plan every day. They also organized mutual aid groups to correct each other's movements and summarize their experiences every day. They came from Guangzhou and felt that the water in the Beijing swimming pool was cold, but they still insisted on practicing. Initially, their results were slightly worse than in Guangzhou, but by the time of the finals, they had improved compared to Guangzhou.
    In terms of unity and friendship, the athletes fully promoted the glorious tradition of the People's Army. At the end of the first match of the tug-of-war championship final between the Volunteer Army and the Northwest Military Region, athlete number 310 of the Northwest Military Region fainted and could not continue the competition. In the second match, the Northwest Military Region had only eleven people left, but the Volunteer Army abandoned this opportunity to win easily and voluntarily reduced one person as well. In the soccer match between the Air Force and the Military Academy, the Military Academy's goalkeeper was injured during the competition, and the Air Force soccer team sent a special person to the hospital to express their condolences. Jiang Jinfu (East China Military Region), the first-place winner in the pommel horse final, bent his legs when jumping on the pommel horse before the competition. He exchanged experiences with athletes from the Air Force, Public Security Force, and Southwest Military Region, and corrected the shortcoming of bending his legs during the preliminary competition. Xiong Kaifa (Navy), the first-place winner in the men's 100-meter freestyle swimming event, did not know how to do the vertical flip turn, so Ye Ziyou of the Air Force patiently taught him. The Navy's underwater swimming group and underwater swimming athletes from fraternal units studied underwater swimming methods together. They did not distinguish between team boundaries and unreservedly shared their experiences with each other.
    Thousands of athletes are rapidly progressing under this spirit of "studying humbly, competing to improve, uniting and progressing." Zheng Sufei, who won first place in both the women's 200-meter breaststroke and 400-meter freestyle swimming events, had a result of three minutes and fifty-five seconds when she first practiced the 200-meter breaststroke after arriving in Beijing from Central South. In the preliminary round, she improved to three minutes and fifty-one seconds, and in the final, she improved to three minutes and thirty-eight seconds and seven tenths. Gu Changshuo, the first-place winner in the men's high jump, jumped one meter seventy-two when he first arrived in Beijing from the Southwest, and jumped one meter seventy-six in the final. Wu Yuanjin, the first-place winner in the men's long jump, could only jump five meters eighty-three in East China; in Beijing, he improved to six meters and eight centimeters; and in the final, he was able to jump six meters thirty-eight and a half centimeters.

    “八一”体育大会运动员贯彻了大会“虚心学习、竞相进取、团结进步”的精神
    “八一”体育运动大会各代表队运动员在竞赛和表演过程中，贯彻了大会“虚心学习、竞相进取、团结进步”的精神，都有很大的进步。
    在运动场上，选手们都抱着虚心学习的态度。中量级举重第一名刘庸福，看见轻量级冠军殷国华的下蹲式抓举的姿势很好，练了两天就掌握了要领。女子五十公尺自由式游泳第一名袁萃英，发现吴传玉自由式游的很好，就自动请教他。西北军区篮球队虽然两战两败，但他们毫不灰心，仍然积极地观摩兄弟代表队的长处来改进自己，并提出：“打一场，进一步”的口号，终于在第三场比赛时获胜。军事学院代表队某些项目的成绩虽然比较差，但他们始终以饱满的精神、谦虚的态度积极地进行学习。
    选手们在运动场上充分发扬了人民军队勤学苦练的优良作风。径赛选手伊套特格，是从内蒙古大草原来的，虽然他很不习惯北京的炎热，但他仍和李殿生等每天一道在烈日下练习，他们在五千公尺赛跑决赛时分别得到第一、第二名。海军的游泳队规定了一定的练习计划，运动员每天按计划完成，并组织了互助小组，互相纠正动作，每天总结经验。他们来自广州，感到北京游泳池水凉，但他们仍然坚持练习，起初成绩比在广州时差一点，但到决赛时比在广州时有了进步。
    在团结友爱方面，选手们充分地发扬了人民军队的光荣传统。志愿军和西北军区拔河冠军决赛第一场终了时，西北军区的三一零号运动员昏倒不能继续比赛，第二场西北军区就只剩下十一个人，但志愿军放弃了这个可以轻易取胜的机会，也自动地减少一人。空军和军事学院比赛足球，军事学院守门员在竞赛时负伤，空军足球队派了专人去医院慰问。木马决赛第一名蒋进富（华东军区），竞赛前跳木马时弯腿，他和空军、公安部队、西南军区的选手们互相交换经验，在预赛时就改正了弯腿的缺点。男子百公尺自由式游泳第一名熊开发（海军），不会竖轮式转身，空军的叶子由就耐心地教他。海军的潜泳小组和兄弟部队的潜泳选手们一起研究潜泳的方法，他们不分队的界限，都毫无保留地把经验介绍给对方。
    数千选手们都在这种“虚心学习、竞相进取、团结进步”的精神下迅速地进步着。获得女子二百公尺蛙式和四百公尺自由式游泳两项第一名的郑素绯，她刚从中南到北京时练习二百公尺蛙式游泳的成绩是三分五十五秒，预赛时进到三分五十一秒，决赛时进到三分三十八秒七。男子跳高第一名顾昌硕，从西南刚到北京时跳一公尺七二，决赛时跳一公尺七六。男子跳远第一名吴愿金，在华东时只能跳五公尺八三；到北京时进到六公尺零八；决赛时就能跳到六公尺三八点五。（新华社）
