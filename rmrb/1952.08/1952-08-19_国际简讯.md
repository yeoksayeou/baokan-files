Albania Protests Provocative Actions by Italian and Greek Reactionaries

The Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Italian representative office in Tirana, lodging a strong protest against Italian aircraft violating Albanian airspace three more times between July 16 and July 28, 1952. Albanian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Prifti sent a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General, informing the United Nations of nine new incidents of Greek armed forces violating Albanian airspace and territory from July 7 to August 2, 1952. He requested the United Nations to take immediate measures to stop such hostile actions that could endanger the cause of peace.

U.S. Promises to Support British Request for British Troops to Remain in Japan

The Italian newspaper "Avanti!" reported: According to sources close to the British Foreign Office, during Acheson's last visit to London, Eden managed to have Britain and the United States "resolve" the issue of British interests in Japan. Apparently, this was Acheson's quid pro quo for Eden's concessions on the Korean issue, formally agreeing to support the British proposal to the Yoshida government to conclude a British-Japanese agreement similar to the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement" so that countries belonging to the British Empire could continue to station troops in Japanese territory.

According to Eden's proposal, Japan should cede ten military bases to countries belonging to the British Empire. These troops can enjoy extraterritorial rights and free labor (such as local warehouses, transportation, fuel, electricity, and labor). In addition, the Japanese government must pay the British Empire £4 million annually to compensate for other occupation expenses.

Correction: In the article "The Superiority and Characteristics of China's 1952 National Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budget" in the 84th issue of the "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Special Issue" on the 17th, the last section of "(1) Superiority" stating "...the wholesale price index of six major cities, taking January and February of 1950 as 100, was 113 in January and February of 1951." Both "January and February" should be "December". We hereby make a correction.

    阿尔巴尼亚抗议意、希反动派的挑衅行为
    阿尔巴尼亚外交部致意大利驻地拉那代表团照会一件，对意大利飞机在一九五二年七月十六日和二十八日间又三次侵犯阿尔巴尼亚领空的事件提出强硬的抗议。阿尔巴尼亚外交部副部长普里夫蒂致函联合国秘书处，通知联合国关于从一九五二年七月七日到八月二日希腊武装部队侵犯阿尔巴尼亚领空和领土的九次新事件。要求联合国立即采取措施以制止这种足以危害和平事业的敌视行动。
    美国答应支持英国要求英军留驻日本
    意大利的“前进报”报道：据接近英国外交部人士消息，上次艾奇逊访问伦敦时，艾登设法使英美双方“解决”了英国在日本的利益问题。显然这是艾奇逊作为艾登在朝鲜问题上让步的交换条件，正式答应了支持英国向吉田政府所提的建议，订立一个与美日“行政协定”相似的英日协定，以便英帝国所属的各国可以继续在日本领土内驻军。
    根据艾登的建议，日本应将十个军事基地让给英帝国所属的各国。这些驻军可以享受治外法权与免费的劳务（例如当地的仓库、运输、燃料、电力与劳动力等）。此外，日本政府每年还要支付英帝国四百万英镑，以补偿其他的占领费用。更正十七日“抗美援朝专刊”第八十四期“我国一九五二年度国家财政收支预算的优越性和特点”一文中“（一）优越性”部分的末段“……六个大都市的批发物价指数，如以一九五○年一、二月为一○○，则一九五一年一、二月为一一三。”其中两个“一、二月”，均应为“十二月”。特此更正。
