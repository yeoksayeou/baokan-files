Economic Life Brief Commentary

    The serious violation of national financial discipline by the Suiyuan Provincial Department of Finance in falsely reporting and illegally claiming large amounts of funds from the state is intolerable. Since 1950, the department has established its own "private coffers" with illegal gains from false reporting and illegal claims, which currently amount to over 68 billion yuan. During the "Three-Anti" Movement, the Suiyuan Provincial Department of Finance did not seriously examine these errors. After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the department continued to disregard instructions from higher authorities on strictly enforcing financial discipline. When inspection teams went to investigate, the department dared to perfunctorily deal with them and attempt to conceal this serious error. Judging from this incident, the Suiyuan Provincial Department of Finance can be said to have reached a point of lawlessness.

    What is even more serious is that Jin Chongzhi, the director of the provincial Department of Finance, not only failed to conduct a deep self-criticism regarding this serious incident, but instead said, "If we report truthfully, what kind of first-level finance would this be?" Clearly, they regarded the "first-level finance" under the unified leadership of the central government as their own independent kingdom. As a result, they acted recklessly, disregarded laws and discipline, completely undermining the discipline and dignity of the national financial system, and throwing Suiyuan Province's financial situation into chaos. The leading cadres of the Suiyuan Provincial Department of Finance must conduct an in-depth examination based on this incident and thoroughly correct their mistakes. The cadres who bear primary responsibility should be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.

    Similar phenomena of violating financial discipline, like that of the Suiyuan Provincial Department of Finance, exist to varying degrees in other regions. This illustrates the importance of strengthening financial supervision work. Relevant leading organs should pay sufficient attention to this issue, establish and improve financial supervision institutions, combine mass-based bottom-up inspection and supervision, thoroughly investigate the phenomena of violating financial discipline that have already occurred, and prevent the continued occurrence of such phenomena. All inspected units must welcome such inspections and assist inspection personnel in their work, so as to rely on everyone's strength to do a good job in financial work.

### 建立严格的财政监察工作和违反财政纪律的现象作斗争

    建立严格的财政监察工作和违反财政纪律的现象作斗争
    绥远省财政厅向国家大量虚报、冒领款项的严重违反国家财政纪律的行为，是令人不能容忍的。从一九五○年起，该厅就以虚报、冒领的非法所得，建立了本省的“小家当”，据目前已经查清的，即达六百八十多亿元。在“三反”运动中，绥远省财政厅并未认真检查这些错误；在“三反”运动后，该厅对上级关于严格执行财政纪律的指示，仍然置之不理；在检查组前往检查的时候，该厅竟敢敷衍、搪塞，企图把这一严重错误隐瞒过去。就这一事件而论，绥远省财政厅可说已经发展到无法无天的地步。
    更严重的是，该省财政厅长靳崇智对于这一严重事件，不但不进行深刻检讨，反说：“如果据实上报，这还算什么一级财政呢？”显然，他们把在中央统一领导下的“一级财政”，看成了自己的独立王国。于是胡作非为，目无法纪，完全破坏了国家财政制度的纪律与尊严，并使绥远省的财政状况，陷于混乱状态。绥远省财政厅的领导干部必须根据这一事件，进行深入的检查，彻底改正自己的错误；负主要责任的干部，并应受到应得的处分。
    类似绥远省财政厅这种破坏财政纪律的现象，在其他地区，也或多或少的存在着。这就说明了加强财政监察工作的重要性。各有关领导机关，应当足够地重视这个问题，建立并健全财政监察机构，结合群众性的自下而上的检查和监督，彻底检查已经发生的违犯财政纪律的现象，并防止这种现象的继续发生。各个受检查的单位，必须欢迎这种检查，帮助检查人员进行工作，以便依靠大家的力量，把财政工作做好。
