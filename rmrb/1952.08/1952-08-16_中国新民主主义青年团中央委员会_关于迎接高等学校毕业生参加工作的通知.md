    Notice from the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League
    Regarding Welcoming College Graduates to Participate in Work

    This summer, a large number of college graduates across the country will be assigned by the People's Government to various construction posts to work. Based on past experience, after graduates participate in work, due to differences in environment and living habits, many people are prone to emotional fluctuations and even some ideological problems. They also often encounter some practical difficulties in their work. These problems need to be appropriately resolved to better leverage their work enthusiasm. Therefore, the youth league grassroots organizations in all units that have graduates assigned to work, in addition to assisting the Party committee in doing regular ideological education work for graduates, should also conduct the following work according to the specific circumstances:

    I. Do a good job of receiving graduates and introducing the situation. The league organizations of relevant units can, under the leadership of the Party, organize small-scale welcome parties or get-togethers independently or jointly with the administration and trade unions (for example, factories use workshops as units, and larger agencies use departments as units). Invite responsible comrades from the Party and government to speak or give reports, introduce the relevant situation of the unit, and point out the issues that should be paid attention to in the work. At the same time, graduates who were assigned to the unit last year can be invited to talk about their situation and experience after participating in the work. Such meetings should be lively, joyful, and have ideological content, and should not be extravagant, wasteful, or perfunctory.

    II. Pay attention to the specific assistance to graduates participating in the work. Close contact can be established with them through small-scale forums, heart-to-heart talks, and individual connections of assigned league members (league members among the graduates should be quickly incorporated into the league branch to participate in organizational life). Timely understand their problems and difficulties in work, ideology, and life, and give them sincere care and enthusiastic help. Their reasonable demands and correct opinions should be promptly and responsibly reflected to the Party and administration, and assist the Party and administration to appropriately resolve them. For certain incorrect thoughts or unreasonable demands, they should be patiently explained and persuaded through appropriate methods, and an indifferent attitude or simple organizational means should not be used to deal with them.

    When college graduates participate in work, they generally have high hopes and enthusiasm. If the league organization can assist the Party committee in doing the above work, it will play a great role in consolidating their work enthusiasm and leveraging their work initiative. The league grassroots organizations of all relevant units should give sufficient attention to this work and provide specific leadership. The league committees of all provinces and cities should report the situation and experience of carrying out this work to the Central Committee of the League. August 14th

    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    关于迎接高等学校毕业生参加工作的通知
    今年暑期，全国将有大批高等学校毕业生由人民政府统一分配到各种建设岗位工作。根据过去经验，毕业生参加工作后，由于环境和生活习惯等不同，许多人常易引起情绪波动，甚至产生一些思想问题。他们在工作中也常常碰到一些实际困难。这些问题，需要帮助他们适当地解决，以便更好地发挥他们的工作积极性。因此，凡是分配有毕业生参加工作的单位的青年团基层组织，除协助党委做好对毕业生的经常的思想教育工作外，还应根据具体情况，进行如下工作：
    一、做好接待毕业生和介绍情况的工作。各有关单位的团组织，可在党的领导下单独地或与行政、工会共同地组织小规模（例如工厂以车间为单位，较大的机关以部门为单位）的欢迎会或联欢会，请党、政负责同志讲话或作报告，介绍本单位的有关情况，指出工作中应注意的问题，同时还可请去年分配到本单位的毕业生讲述他们参加工作后的情况和经验。这样的会要开得活泼愉快和有思想内容，不可铺张浪费或流于形式。
    二、注意对参加工作的毕业生的具体帮助。可通过小型的座谈会、谈心会、分配团员个别联系等方式，和他们取得密切联系（毕业生中的团员，应迅速编入团支部过组织生活），及时了解他们在工作、思想、生活等方面的问题和困难，给予真诚的关心和热情的帮助。对于他们的合理的要求和正确的意见，应及时向党和行政作负责的反映，并协助党和行政加以适当解决。对于某些不正确的思想或不合理的要求，则应通过适当方式对他们进行耐心的解释和说服教育，不应采取漠不关心的态度或用简单的组织手段去处理。
    高等学校毕业生参加工作时，一般都是抱着很高的希望和热情的。如果团的组织能够协助党委做好上述工作，对于巩固他们的工作热情，发挥他们的工作积极性，将会起很大作用。各有关单位的团基层组织，应对这一工作给以足够的重视，并加以具体领导。各省、市团委应将进行这一工作的情况和经验报告团中央。  八月十四日
