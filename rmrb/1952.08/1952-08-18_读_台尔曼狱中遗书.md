    Reading "Telmann's Last Testament from Prison"
    Translated by Jiang Chengfan, published by World Knowledge Press, June 1952, first edition, Qi Rong
    Comrade Ernst Thälmann, the former chairman of the German Communist Party and a beloved leader of the German people, was murdered by Nazi bandits eight years ago. Thälmann was arrested in the spring of 1933, a few weeks after the Nazi bandits set fire to the German Parliament. He spent eleven long years in prison, and on this day eight years ago, August 18, 1944, he was finally murdered. This small booklet is one of his last testaments, written in the Bautzen prison. Reading it today still has a very profound educational significance. As Goethe quoted in this book, "Letters are one of the most important monuments that an individual can leave behind," this letter is an important monument left behind by Thälmann himself. The unwavering integrity and dauntless fighting spirit that Thälmann demonstrates in this letter are a great encouragement to every soldier who opposes fascist warmongers and fights for peace and freedom today. In this book, we can see a great personality dedicated to the cause of communism, the best example worthy of our efforts to learn from.
    This book first shows us that a true communist fighter is full of infinite confidence in the great cause he is engaged in, and no test can change his strong will to fight to the end for this ideal. Life in a Nazi prison was inhuman: "The loneliness of long-term imprisonment, the prison environment that kills the soul, the four bare walls, and the long-term lack of freedom inevitably produce temporary mental depression and cries of despair." (Page 5 of this book) Here, Thälmann regretted that "the most active years of my mature prime have been sacrificed behind bars" (page 32), "When I think of how many things have slipped away during my years of imprisonment, I have to close my eyes" (page 5). However, Thälmann was never overwhelmed by suffering, but conquered it. The torture of long-term prison life only made him stronger, "creating a virtue from suffering" (ibid.). What was supporting Thälmann? It was confidence in the victory of communism: "Purity of faith always constantly pulls us out of this oppressive, desolate, and almost uncomforting prison atmosphere. The certainty of the cause, as a reviving force encouraging individuals in prison, is a force that produces such great effects. It is precisely this firm foundation of man that supports man in all difficult encounters, providing spiritual courage, strength, and determination." (ibid.) Because of this, Thälmann victoriously overcame all trials. Nazi agents brutally tortured him, using every possible method to try to force a confession from him, and even trying to destroy his nerves with hypnosis, but all failed. His iron will never wavered for a moment, never surrendered for a moment.
    The communist cause is great and arduous. "The communist cause is a long-term, cruel, difficult, and victorious struggle." (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists") Therefore, one of the most valuable qualities of a communist fighter is his indomitable fighting spirit. Thälmann taught his young comrades in the letter he replied to, and he also teaches us:
    "Remember, people are placed in front of life's arrangements of struggle, not to make them succumb to it, but to make them masters of it, to make them understand its cold but necessary language, so that they become younger and rise from the abyss to new life." (Page 33) "Only struggle has meaning in life!" (Page 4) Precisely because he had such a profound understanding of the meaning of struggle, Thälmann never missed any favorable opportunity to strike at the enemy. During the period of the Nazi gang's preliminary trial of Thälmann, he "appeared not as a defendant defending against the prosecution, but as a plaintiff accusing the prosecution of manufacturing blatant lies." (Page 15) This was a sensational event, and even the insidious enemy was greatly shocked. They were afraid that Thälmann would expose them in public. The Thälmann case shocked the world, and well-known figures from all walks of life organized a Thälmann Committee. World public opinion was also concerned about this matter. These many situations forced the Nazi regime not to hold a trial. Thälmann wrote with regret about losing such a powerful opportunity to expose the enemy: "This is a great disappointment to me. I could not experience this great joy and this powerful trial drama, and our party and my friends had to regretfully lose this victory that the trial would surely bring us." (Page 18) What great spirit, what high fighting spirit! If it were not for the cowardice of the Nazi bandits, the second Leipzig trial would be immortal in history.
    This letter also tells us that a true communist fighter must be a patriot and an internationalist. Let's see what our beloved Comrade Thälmann said: "The people to whom I belong, the people I love, are the German people, and my nation is the German nation that I admire with great pride, a brave, proud, and tenacious nation. … My life and work have always known only one thing, and that is: for the benefit of the working German people, to dedicate my spirit, my knowledge, my experience, my activity, and even my entire life, to strive for the future benefits of Germany, the benefits of the victorious socialist free struggle, and to strive for the new revival of the German nation." (Page 35) A true proletarian fighter not only loves his own country, but also loves the working people of all countries, because he deeply understands that the interests of the proletariat of the world are consistent and their cause is common. Comrade Thälmann never regarded his cause as something isolated, but connected it with the struggle of the working people all over the world. He said: "My destiny is entrusted to the core of world events, entrusted to the flames of the current political atmosphere, and entrusted to the turbulent life of the working people." (Page 34) "The martyrdom I have undertaken, the martyrdom for the great socialist ideal of the twentieth century, is not alone and isolated, not separated from the German people, but is shared by many unnamed imprisoned comrades, and it is echoed in the life of the huge mass movement, which movement has inspired and encouraged the entire people in the socialist Soviet Union, and has also been ideologically and organizationally developed in many other parts of the world." (Page 36)
    Thälmann loved the people of his country so much and maintained such close ties with the masses, and therefore was able to win the support and trust of the people. "Most of the German people today (referring to the time of writing the letter) have been taught by the Nazi regime, and some Germans, formerly on the left or even with leftist ideas, have trusted us and our party."
    (Page 4) From the following small matter, we can also clearly see how much the German people loved Comrade Thälmann: on the way from the Hanover Judicial Prison to the Bautzen Penal Prison in Saxony, he stayed for a while in a tavern, when people recognized him, "The restaurant owner, his wife, and all the employees all ran out to see me. It was not until half past six in the evening that our journey could continue. At this time, these people all stood outside, giving me a farewell with smiles and silent blessings. The innkeeper's daughter held the child in her arms and gave me the last farewell salute, and thinking that I could unexpectedly enjoy such silent pleasure, my tears could not help but well up." (Pages 26-27)
    Comrade Thälmann has left us. The evil German fascist beasts murdered his precious life. But his spirit continues to live, forever lives, burning in the hearts of every peace and democratic fighter. The German fascist murderers have been overthrown, but their inhuman fascist spirit has not died out, but has been completely inherited and intensified by the American imperialist cannibals. Therefore, the task before every peace and democratic fighter today is still arduous. Let us keep Comrade Thälmann's last words in mind. "Be tenacious, loyal, and firm in character, and have confidence in victory in action. Only in this way can we master our destiny, can we complete our revolutionary tasks for the great historical mission that falls on our shoulders, and can we help true socialism achieve final victory. …”
    "Only those who fight every day for freedom and life deserve freedom and life!" (The last words of Thälmann's Last Testament from Prison) Excellent primary school teacher Liu Rong, Beijing Yucai Primary School Correspondence Group
    Comrade Liu Rong is the homeroom teacher of Class 2, Grade 2 of the five-year consistent experimental class at Beijing Yucai Primary School. She has been working at Yucai Primary School for six years now. She has been working diligently for six years and has achieved many results. This shows that she is a people's teacher who is willing to strive for the cause of education.
    During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Liu Rong followed the organization's assignment and resolutely took up the post of primary school education. After entering Beijing, some old classmates expressed many voices of "regret" and even "unfairness" to Comrade Liu Rong: "Why are you still staying in elementary school?" "Why not promote you?" "Go south to develop!" However, Comrade Liu Rong replied: "I really don't feel that my work is not important in any way, and I don't feel that it is any worse than yours."
    In the first three and a half years, she served as the homeroom teacher of four classes and also taught arithmetic and nature. It was almost half a year to change jobs. This one hasn't been mastered yet, and you have to learn that one from scratch, but she didn't complain at all. Whatever work was assigned, she would study and do it steadily. If she couldn't do it well for a while, she wouldn't be afraid to redo it ten or twenty times. In Jingxing, Hebei in 1948, three schools merged, and the students' levels were very uneven. Comrade Liu Rong spent almost all of her spare time on a dozen students who were older and had poor levels. Regardless of wind, rain, day, or night, she would go to various places to tutor the students. Because she was too tired, she suddenly gave premature birth one night. The next day, colleagues and students went to see her. She was lying on the kang and was still arranging extracurricular studies for the students and entrusting her unfinished tasks to the comrades.
    In the autumn of 1950, the leadership selected Comrade Liu Rong to take on the work of the experimental class. Because all the children in the school were boarding, the children who were just entering school were not used to leaving their mothers to live a collective life, and they had different personalities. Almost all of them didn't like to listen to the teacher, so the classes and queues were chaotic everywhere, falling to the east and leaning to the west, crying and shouting. Comrade Liu Rong led the nannies to carefully take care of the six- and seven-year-old children's food, clothing, and daily life, approached the children, and introduced them to each other, so that the children could understand the school and the teacher. The children's emotions gradually stabilized and gradually became accustomed to collective life.
    After two months of efforts, she carefully studied the children's thoughts and feelings, learned to say the words they liked to hear, learned how to teach the first-grade class, how to cultivate the children's personality, and improved the work step by step. Her class of children also grew up step by step.
    In terms of teaching, Comrade Liu Rong fully grasped the leading role of the teacher. She said: "To teach children well, the teacher must teach well. To teach well, the teacher must be prepared." Therefore, before teaching each lesson, she made full preparations in advance: repeatedly comprehending the content of the teaching materials, carefully observing the children's thoughts, feelings, and life, and learning their language. She observed the surrounding environment, sought all available intuitive teaching materials, and carefully recorded the children's strengths and mistakes in learning. She used these as the basis and tool for teaching, and under the guidance of the teaching principles, she formulated specific implementation methods. She made detailed lesson plans for every lesson she taught throughout the year. Therefore, in teaching, every word she said penetrated the children's hearts.
    She also constantly combined classroom teaching to tell children many stories about Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao, and gradually cultivated the children's self-consciousness. Now every child will seriously use the words "The great Lenin is very serious about everything" to criticize those who do not study seriously. Comrade Liu Rong also encouraged the children to read extracurricular reading materials such as comic strips and the Chinese Young Pioneers. She first took the initiative to introduce some stories to everyone, mobilized everyone's emotions, and then helped them read a part. As a result, the children became interested in reading. This not only broadened the children's knowledge and cultivated the habit of reading, but also improved their enthusiasm for learning. The students' academic performance has also gradually consolidated and improved.
    Comrade Liu Rong is also good at inducing children through classroom teaching and the power of the organization. For example, through the "Red Scarf" class, she inspired the children's desire to join the Young Pioneers; and through the "Good Things" class, she guided the children to strive to meet the conditions for joining the team from actual activities, and specifically guided them on how to do it.
    In teaching, Comrade Liu Rong not only taught seriously herself, but also strictly required the children to learn seriously, and did not allow the slightest carelessness. For example, during the exam, a student did very well in the whole paper, but only dropped a punctuation mark, or omitted the word "China" in the place where he should answer "Chinese Communist Party", he could not get a score of five. She insists on having review classes and comprehensive assessment and summary every week for her language classes, clearly pointing out the shortcomings in teaching, and requiring them to be improved within the next week. Therefore, the learning results are very consolidated.
    Comrade Liu Rong also pays great attention to the teaching of other subjects. She often exchanges students' learning situations with arithmetic teachers and personally listens to other teachers' classes. In her lesson plan book, she recorded the arithmetic grades of all students, and helped other teachers improve their teaching and helped children learn specifically.
    In terms of moral education, she initially encountered many difficulties, but she was not intimidated by the difficulties, but actively sought ways to solve the difficulties. On the one hand, she deepened her understanding of the children's personalities, and on the other hand, she worked hard to learn the advanced educational theories of the Soviet Union. She found valuable materials in Makarenko's collection of educational papers—organizing children's collective activities and using the power of the collective to help individual weaker children progress. She followed this principle to solve problems and changed the past practice of teachers handling everything personally. If she encountered a slightly major problem, or a student made a relatively serious mistake, she would bring it to all the children, explaining the impact of this matter on the entire class, how everyone should pay attention to it, how to deal with it, and calling on everyone to help the students who had made mistakes. For example, there was a child named Bi Manping, who was quite willful at ordinary times. Once, during an art class, she cried and made a lot of noise in the classroom because of a small matter, which affected the students' learning. After class, the children ran to tell Comrade Liu Rong the news, some with angry expressions, some with indifferent expressions, and some thought that the teacher should punish Bi Manping severely this time. But Comrade Liu Rong did not do this. In her spare time, Comrade Liu Rong gathered all the students together, explaining Bi Manping's mistake of making noise in the classroom, which was not only that she should not be angry and impolite to the teacher, but the most important thing was that it hindered everyone's learning, thereby inspiring the children's awareness of "collective interests". It was really strange. In the past, when Bi Manping made a mistake, she would always remain silent when the teacher criticized her. After a while, the old problem would happen again. But this time it was different. She frankly admitted her mistake in front of everyone and guaranteed that she would no longer be angry in the classroom, otherwise the students could give her opinions. The other children agreed with her opinion and helped her with an attitude of friendship. Since then, Manping has never been angry in the classroom again, and other willful children have received the same education.
    Comrade Liu Rong also made the children realize the close relationship between collective honor and personal honor from the positive side, so that the children often realized that collective honor is more important than personal honor. She often raised the honor of the class in front of the children based on the personal interests of each child, and asked the children to work hard for it, so that the children slowly felt this point. Sometimes, when Comrade Liu Rong came back after going out for something, the children would rush to report the news and say, "Teacher, our whole class was very disciplined today. We didn't speak in class, and we stood very neatly in line." The children were obviously proud of the honor of their collective. Through many beneficial activities, such as rehearsing dances, systematically and extensively observing nature, planting flowers and vegetables, and eliminating flies, the new morals and qualities of the children were gradually cultivated. Huang Ying's mother, Comrade Zhang Huanlian, wrote in a letter: "...I have already seen the results of your hard work in Huang Ying. She is looking forward to joining the team all day long and being a good student of Chairman Mao. Every time she goes home, she says, 'Mom, when will I be nine years old?' At the same time, she has a collective concept. She always says, 'We are really a model class,' etc., but sometimes she also says sadly, 'Our group is just ruined by one person, and as a result, we are not a model.' Her little heart has a strong collective concept and is full of enthusiasm for loving the motherland. She loves Chairman Mao and loves Stalin..."
    Comrade Liu Rong is an ordinary, loyal, and unassuming worker. She has always been down-to-earth and meticulously engaged in her work. This is her advantage that is worth learning from.

专栏：

    读“台尔曼狱中遗书”
    江程繁译  世界知识出版社一九五二年六月初版  齐荣
    前德国共产党主席，德国人民敬爱的领袖爱尔恩斯特·台尔曼同志，被纳粹匪徒杀害已经八周年了。台尔曼是在一九三三年春，在纳粹匪徒纵火焚毁德国议会后数星期被捕的。他在狱中度过了十一年的漫长岁月，到八年前的今天，即一九四四年八月十八日，终于惨遭杀害。这一本小册子，是他写于包岑狱中的最后遗书之一。我们在今天读到它，依然有着非常深刻的教育意义。正如在这本书中台尔曼所引的歌德的一句话：“信件就是个人所能遗留的最重要的纪念碑之一”，这封信就是台尔曼自己遗留下来的重要纪念碑。台尔曼在这封信中所表现出来的坚贞不屈的气节和那大无畏的战斗精神，对于今天每一个反对法西斯战争贩子，为和平为自由而斗争的战士都是极大的鼓舞。我们可以在这本书中看到一个为共产主义事业献身的伟大人格，一个值得我们努力学习的最好榜样。
    这本书首先让我们看到：一个真正的共产主义战士对自己所从事的伟大事业是充满无穷信心的，任何考验都不能改变他为这个理想而奋斗到底的坚强意志。在纳粹监狱中的生活是非人的：“长年囚禁中的寂寞，戕杀心灵的监狱环境，四面赤裸的墙，和长年的无自由，是免不了会产生一时的精神怨郁和绝望的呼号的。”（本书第五页）在这里，台尔曼惋惜他“成熟的壮年的最有活动力的岁月牺牲在铁窗内”（三二页），“当我想到在我监禁岁月中多少事情已经溜了过去的时候，我就不得不闭上眼睛”（五页），然而台尔曼决没有被痛苦压倒，反而征服了痛苦，长期监狱生活的折磨只是使他锻炼得更坚强，“从苦难中造成一种德性”（同上）。是什么东西在支持台尔曼呢？是对共产主义胜利的信心：“信仰的纯笃总是不断地把我们从这种重压的、荒凉的、几乎毫无安慰的监狱气氛中拔出来的。对于事业的确信，作为鼓励狱中个别的人的苏生的力量，那是发生多么伟大的效果的一种力量。正是人的这种坚定的基础，使人在一切艰难的遭遇中得到支持，得到精神上的勇气，得到力量和坚定。”（同上）正因为如此，台尔曼胜利地战胜了一切考验。纳粹特务野蛮地拷打他，用尽一切方法企图逼出他的口供，甚至想用催眠术来摧毁他的神经，然而都失效了。他钢铁的意志一刻也没有动摇过，一刻也没有屈服过。
    共产主义事业是伟大的，又是艰巨的。“共产主义事业，是一个长期的、残酷的、艰难的、胜利的斗争过程。”（刘少奇：“论共产党员的修养”）因此，一个共产主义战士的最可宝贵的品质之一就是他那不屈不挠的战斗精神。台尔曼这样教导他所复信的年青战友，也同样教导我们：
    “记着，人们被生活安排在斗争面前，不是为了让他们屈服于它，而是要使他们做它的主宰，是为了使他们了解它那冷酷的然而必要的语言，好让他们变得更年轻的从深渊中高升到新生。”（三三页）“在生命中只有斗争是有意义的！”（四页）正因为对于斗争的意义有这样深刻的体会，台尔曼从不放过任何一个有利的打击敌人的机会。在纳粹匪帮对台尔曼进行预审的期间，他“不是作为对公诉辩护的被告，而是作为控诉那制造瞒天大谎的公诉机关的原告出现的。”（十五页）这是一件耸人听闻的事情，甚至连阴险的敌人也感到大大的惊骇，他们害怕台尔曼使他们当众出丑。台尔曼案件惊动了世界，世界各阶层人民的知名人士组织了一个台尔曼委员会，世界舆论也都关切这件事情。这许多情势迫使纳粹政权不敢举行审判了。对于失掉了这么一个有力的揭露敌人的机会，台尔曼惋惜地写道：“这对我是极大的失望。我竟不能体验这巨大的快乐以及这有力量的审判活剧，而我们的党和我的朋友们也不得不很遗憾地失去了这个在审判中一定会带给我们的胜利。”（十八页）这是多么伟大的气概，多么昂扬的战斗精神！如果不是由于纳粹匪徒的怯懦，第二个莱比锡审判将永垂史册而不朽。
    这封信还告诉我们：一个真正的共产主义战士必然是一个爱国主义者与国际主义者。看我们敬爱的台尔曼同志怎样说罢：“我所属的人民，我所爱的人民，是德国人民，我的民族是我带着极大的骄傲所敬仰的德意志民族，就是勇敢，骄傲和顽强的民族。……我的生命和工作从来只知道一件事，那就是：为了劳动的德国人民的利益，把我的精神，我的学识，我的经验，我的活动力，甚至我的全部生命都献出来，争取德国未来的好处，胜利的社会主义自由斗争的好处，争取德国民族的新的复兴。”（三五页）一个真正的无产阶级战士，他不仅仅热爱着自己的国家，同时他也热爱着一切国家的劳动人民，因为他深刻地了解到全世界无产阶级的利益是一致的，他们的事业是共同的。台尔曼同志从不把自己的事业看做是什么孤立的东西，而是把它和全世界劳动人民的斗争相联系起来的。他说：“我的命运是寄托于世界大事的核心，寄托于目前政治空气的火焰，并寄托于劳动人民奔腾澎湃的生活。”（三四页）“我所承担起来的殉道事业，为了二十世纪伟大的社会主义理想的殉道事业，并不是单独的和孤立的，不是和德国人民分开的，而是由许许多多无名的坐牢的同志分担的，它在巨大的亿万群众运动的生活中得到了回声，这种运动在社会主义苏联启发了全体人民的运动，鼓舞了全体人民，在世界上其他许多地方也得到了思想上的和组织上的发展。”（三六页）
    台尔曼如此热爱自己国家的人民，如此和群众保持密切的联系，因而能赢得人民的拥护与信任。“大部分的德国人民在今天（按指写信的当时）已经受过纳粹政权教训了，在从前左翼的以至有左倾思想的一部分德国人，已经信任我们和我们的党”。
    （四页）只从下面一件小事中，我们也可以清楚地看出德国人民是如何挚爱台尔曼同志了：在从汉诺威司法监狱被转送到萨克森的包岑判罚监狱的途中，他在一个酒馆中逗留了一会，这时人们认出了他，“饭店主人和他妻子以及所有的员工，全都跑出来看我。直到晚上六点半钟，我们的旅程才能继续进行。这时候，这些人全站在外面，用微笑和静默的祝福来给我送别。店主女儿抱着孩子在她臂上给我最后一次的送别敬礼，想到我能够意外地享受这样沉默的愉快，我的眼泪不禁夺眶欲出。”（二六——二七页）
    台尔曼同志离开我们了。万恶的德国法西斯野兽杀害了他宝贵的生命。但他的精神却继续活着，永远活着，燃烧着每一个和平民主战士的心。德国法西斯凶手被打倒了，但他们那灭绝人性的法西斯精神并未死灭，却由美帝国主义吃人者完全继承下来而且变本加厉了。因此，摆在今天每一个和平民主战士面前的任务仍然是艰巨的。让我们把台尔曼同志的遗教谨记在心。“在品格上要顽强、忠诚和坚定，在行动中要有胜利的信心，这样，也只有这样，我们才能主宰我们的命运，才能为落在我们肩上的伟大的历史使命去完成我们革命的任务，才能够帮助真正的社会主义取得最后胜利。……”
    “只有那些为争取自由和生命而每天斗争的人，才配得到自由和生命！”（台尔曼狱中遗书的最后一语）优秀的小学教师刘容北京育才小学通讯组
    刘容同志是北京育才小学五年一贯制实验班二年二班的班主任。她在育才小学工作，到现在已是第六个年头了。她六年如一日地埋头苦干，取得了不少的成绩。这说明了她是一个愿为教育事业奋斗的人民教师。
    在第三次国内革命战争期间，刘容同志听从了组织的分配，毅然走上了小学教育的岗位。进北京后，一些旧时的同学对刘容同志发出许多“惋惜”甚至“不平”的声音：“怎么你还在小学里呆着？”“怎么不提拔提拔？”“快南下去开展开展吧！”然而刘容同志回答说：“我实在感觉不到我的工作有那一点不重要，更感觉不到有那一点不如你们。”
    开头的三年半中，她担任过四个班的班主任，还教过算术，教过自然。差不多是半年一换工作。这件还没摸熟，又得从头去学那一件，但她没有一点怨言，分配到什么工作，就踏踏实实地去学去做，一时做不好，不怕十遍二十遍地重做。一九四八年在河北井陉时，三个学校合并，学生的程度很不齐，刘容同志几乎将全部课余的时间都花到十几个年龄大程度差的学生身上。不管是风里、雨里、日里、夜里，到时候就分别到各处去给学生补习功课。因过于劳累，一天晚上忽然早产了。第二天同事和同学们去看她，她躺在炕上，还在给学生们安排课外学习，并把自己未完成的任务委托给同志们。
    一九五○年秋天，领导方面选择刘容同志去担任实验班的工作。因为学校的孩子全部是住校，初入学的儿童不习惯于离开妈妈过集体生活，而且他们又具有不同的性格，差不多都不爱听教师的话，于是上课站队处处混乱，东倒西歪，哭哭叫叫。刘容同志带领着保育员细心地料理这些六、七岁的孩子们的衣食起居，和孩子们接近，并给他们互相介绍小朋友，让孩子了解学校，了解老师。孩子们的情绪渐趋安定，逐渐习惯于集体生活。
    经过两个来月的努力，她仔细地研究孩子们的思想情感，学会说她们爱听的话，学习一年级的课该怎么教，怎么培养孩子们的个性，一步步改进工作，她的班的孩子也就一步步成长起来。
    在教学方面，刘容同志充分掌握了教师的主导作用。她说：“要孩子学好必须老师教好，老师要教好必须准备好。”因此她每教一课，事先都进行充分的准备：反复体会教材的内容，细心观察儿童们的思想情感、生活，学习他们的语言。她观察四周围的环境，谋求一切可资利用的直观教材，并且留心记录儿童们在学习中出现的优点和错误。她以这些为教学的根据和工具，在教学原则的指导下，制订具体的实施办法。一年来她教的每一课都作了详尽的教案。因此在教学中，她的每一句话都深入儿童的心灵。
    她还不断地结合着课堂教学，给儿童讲了许多关于列宁、斯大林、毛主席的故事，逐渐培养了儿童们的自觉性。现在每个孩子都会严肃地用“伟大的列宁，对每件事情都很认真”的话来批评学习不认真的人。刘容同志还启发儿童们阅读连环图画、中国少年报等课外读物。她先主动地给大家介绍一些故事，把大家的情绪鼓动起来，再帮助他们读上一部分。于是孩子们对阅读发生了兴趣。这不仅扩大了儿童的知识面，培养了读书的习惯，而且提高了学习的积极性。同学们的学习成绩也就逐渐巩固、提高了。
    刘容同志还善于通过课堂教学和组织的力量，去诱导孩子们。比如通过“红领巾”课启发孩子们加入少年儿童队的要求；又通过“好事情”课引导儿童们从实际活动中努力达到入队条件，并且具体指导他们应该怎样去做。
    在教学上刘容同志不仅自己认真地教，同时也严格要求儿童认真地学，不容许有丝毫的马虎。比如考试时某一个学生全篇都考的非常好，就只掉了一个标点符号，或是应该回答“中国共产党”的地方遗漏了“中国”二字，都不能得五分。她的语文课每周都坚持有复习课和全面的考核、总结，明确指出教学方面的缺点，要求在下周内一定要改进。因此学习的成绩是很巩固的。
    刘容同志对其他学科的教学也非常注意。她经常和算术科教师交换学生的学习情况，亲自去听各科老师上课。在她的教案本上记着全部学生的算术科学习成绩，随时帮助其他教师提高教学，具体帮助孩子学习。
    在品德的培养方面，最初她曾遇到不少的困难，但她并不为困难所吓倒，而是积极地去寻求解决困难的途径。她一方面深入了解孩子的个性，另一方面努力学习苏联的先进的教育理论。她在马卡伦柯的教育论文集中发现了宝贵的材料——组织儿童的集体活动，用集体的力量去帮助个别较差儿童进步。她遵循着这个原则来着手解决问题，改变了过去遇事都由教师个人处理的作风。如果遇到稍为重大的问题，或者某一同学发生比较严重的过错时，她就把它提到全班孩子面前，说明这件事对全班的影响，大家应该怎样重视它，处理它，号召大家都来帮助犯过的同学。例如有一个孩子叫毕曼平，平时相当任性，有一次上美术课时她因一点小事就在课堂上大哭大闹，影响了同学们的学习。下课后孩子们纷纷跑来告诉刘容同志这消息，有的孩子带着气愤的神色，有的倒是满不在乎的样子，有的以为这一下老师应好好处罚毕曼平一顿了。可是刘容同志并不这样做。在课余的时间，刘容同志把全班学生召集到一块，说明毕曼平在课堂上吵闹的错误，不仅在于她不该发脾气，对老师不礼貌，而最主要的是妨碍了大家的学习，从而启发了孩子们对“集体利益”的自觉，真奇怪，过去毕曼平犯了错误以后，老师批评她时，她总是不啃声，过了不久，老毛病又犯起来了。但这次却不同了，她坦然地在大家的面前承认了错误、保证以后不再在课堂上发脾气，否则同学们可以给她提意见。其他孩子同意了她的意见，而且还以一种友谊的态度来帮助她。从此以后，曼平再不在课堂上发脾气了，其他任性的孩子，也受到了同样的教育。
    刘容同志还从积极方面使孩子们认识到集体荣誉与个人荣誉间的密切关系，让孩子们常常认识到集体的荣誉重于个人的荣誉。她在孩子们面前经常就每个孩子切身的利益提出班的荣誉，要求孩子们为它而努力，使孩子们慢慢地感受了这一点。有时刘容同志因事外出回来，孩子们就纷纷去报告消息说：“老师，今天我们全班都很守纪律，上课时我们没有说话，站队时我们站得很整齐。”孩子们显然在为自己的集体的荣誉而感到骄傲。再通过许多有益的活动，如排练舞蹈，系统广泛地观察自然，种花种菜，消灭苍蝇等等，逐渐培养了儿童的新道德、新品质。黄英的妈妈张焕莲同志来信说：“……你们的艰辛工作，我已经在黄英身上看到了成绩。她整天盼望着入队，作毛主席的好学生，每次回家都说：‘妈妈，我什么时候才够九岁？’同时她有集体观念，她总是说：‘我们真是模范班’等等，但有时也伤心地说：‘我们这一组就是给一个人破坏了，结果我们不是模范。’她小小的心灵里就有了强烈的集体观念，充满了热爱祖国的热情，她热爱毛主席、热爱斯大林……”
    刘容同志是一个平凡的、忠实的、不露锋芒的工作者。她一贯踏踏实实地、精雕细刻地从事工作。这是她值得我们学习的优点。
