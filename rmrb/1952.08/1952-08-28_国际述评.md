Continue to Strengthen and Consolidate the Great Alliance Between China and the Soviet Union

The Chinese government delegation headed by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, arrived in Moscow on the 17th of this month and was warmly and grandly welcomed by the Soviet government. Soviet Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers Molotov, Mikoyan, and Bulganin, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Kumykin, and diplomatic envoys from various people's democratic countries and many Asian countries stationed in Moscow all went to Moscow Central Airport to welcome the Chinese government delegation.

The composition of our government delegation is as follows: Chief Representative Zhou Enlai; Representatives Chen Yun, Li Fuchun, Zhang Wentian, Su Yu; Advisors Wang Heshou, Chen Yu, Song Shaowen, Liu Yalou, Luo Shun Chu, Qiu Chuangcheng, Wang Daohan, Wang Zheng, Shi Zhe, Xu Yixin, Chen Jiakang.

Premier Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of our government delegation, pointed out in his speech at the airport upon arriving in Moscow: "The delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China has come to Moscow this time to continue to strengthen the friendly cooperation between the two countries and to discuss various related issues." This undoubtedly has great significance in the history of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union.

The two great powers of China and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in February 1950, thereby forming a permanent and unbreakable brotherly alliance. The facts of the past two years have shown that the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union has played an extremely important role in safeguarding peace and security in the Far East and the world. Precisely because of this, all peace-loving people enthusiastically hail the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people in peaceful construction. These achievements have greatly increased the strength to defend world peace and have infinitely encouraged the victorious confidence of the people of all countries in the struggle for peace. At the same time, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have also achieved significant accomplishments in the work of building a great motherland, and have greatly enhanced the strength of the country. These achievements of the Chinese people are inseparable from the selfless and enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet government and people. For this reason, the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union has become more consolidated and powerful over the past two years.

The talks between our government delegation in Moscow and the Soviet government will undoubtedly have extremely important roles and contributions to the continued development of friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, to the peaceful construction endeavors of the people of China and the Soviet Union, and to the peaceful construction endeavors of the people of the world.

The Soviet People are Advancing Towards Communism

On August 20, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) issued a statement signed by Comrade Stalin regarding the convening of the Nineteenth Congress of the Party. The statement decided that the date for the congress would be October 5, 1952, and stipulated the agenda of the congress and the procedures for electing delegates. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) also published draft directives on the Soviet development five-year plan for 1951-1955, and draft revisions to the Party Constitution.

Thirteen years have passed since the Eighteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1939. During this period, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Stalin and the Bolshevik Party, have written glorious pages in human history. In the unprecedented Great Patriotic War, the Soviet people paid a huge price to defend their socialist motherland and rescued human civilization from the clutches of fascism, winning peace and progress for the world. After the war, the Soviet people devoted themselves wholeheartedly and steadfastly to peaceful construction, completing the first post-war five-year plan and restoring the national economy to a level that greatly exceeded pre-war levels. Large-scale communist construction projects are being carried out in full swing on the Volga, Don, Dnieper, and Amu Darya rivers. The Soviet people's historic victory over fascism, their great achievements in peaceful labor after the war, and their unwavering adherence to a peaceful foreign policy have brought huge and profound impacts on international life. Facts are increasingly proving that the Soviet Union is the hope and beacon of the people of the world, and a strong fortress of peace and democracy. These victories and achievements of the Soviet people are a shining testament to the invincible power of communist ideology and the strong vitality of the Bolshevik Party.

In order to welcome the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, an unparalleled wave of labor enthusiasm and political enthusiasm is now sweeping across the vast territory of the Soviet Union. Millions of Soviet people, educated by the Leninist-Stalinist party, are contributing new labor achievements to the Party Congress. The Fifth Five-Year Plan, which is to be discussed and adopted at the Party Congress, unfolds a bright and boundless vista of happiness before the Soviet people. The draft plan stipulates that by 1955, the level of Soviet industrial production will be about 70 percent higher than in 1950, the total grain output will increase by 40 to 50 percent, and the national income will increase by at least 60 percent. As "Pravda" stated:

"The Fifth Five-Year Plan heralds a new and tremendous upsurge in the Soviet national economy and guarantees a further and significant improvement in the material welfare and cultural level of the people." The completion of this plan will undoubtedly take the Soviet Union a big step forward from socialism to communism.

The Chinese people and all progressive people in the world are watching every step the Soviet people take towards communism under the leadership of the great Bolshevik Party, and listening to every good news from their peaceful labor front. Every achievement of the Soviet people's peaceful labor is an encouragement to peace-loving people and a blow to the imperialist warmongers. All those who love peace and believe in a bright future for mankind are paying great attention to the convening of the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and will draw endless inspiration from it.

Welcoming the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference

The success of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has greatly encouraged the struggle of the people of various countries in this region to defend peace. At present, the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are launching extensive and enthusiastic activities to welcome the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing.

After returning to their countries, the representatives of various countries who attended the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference widely conveyed the achievements of the preparatory meeting to the people through newspapers, press conferences, and various mass gatherings, making the people of various countries deeply aware that to save the peace of the Asian and Pacific regions and the peace of the world, it is necessary to unite all peace-loving people of all countries and wage unremitting struggles against the instigators of war. This has played an important role in promoting the peace movement of the people of various countries. While conveying the situation of the preparatory meeting, the representatives of various countries also reported on the tremendous achievements of the new China in peaceful construction that they witnessed with their own eyes, as well as the evidence of the United States' germ warfare crimes. This made the people of various countries further realize the urgency and importance of defending peace.

Due to the extensive activities of peace fighters in various countries, the movement to prepare for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has had a tremendous impact on the people of various countries. The Soviet people warmly support the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and the issues on the agenda of the conference are widely discussed in Soviet newspapers, radio broadcasts, and meetings. In India and Japan, the peace movement is higher than at any time in the past. On the basis of strengthening the unity of various peace organizations and mass groups, the peace movement in India is developing rapidly and extensively. "Asia Week" was held across India from August 3rd to 10th. In Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Julongdu and many other cities and villages, peace advocates used door-to-door propaganda, discussions, and public gatherings to widely publicize the significance of convening the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and called on the people of the country to prepare for the conference. Trade union organizations in East Punjab Province and other places in India successively convened peace conferences and elected representatives to attend. The All-India Sponsors Conference of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will also be held on September 9 to discuss the preparatory work for participating in the Peace Conference and to formulate proposals to be submitted to the Peace Conference. The Japan Peace Protection Committee, with the support of various trade unions, democratic groups, and social celebrities, has launched a "Peace Movement Month" from June 25 to August 15, stipulating that it will launch a national movement aimed at supporting the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Activities for electing representatives in various parts of Japan are in full swing, and more than 200 candidates for representatives have been elected. In fighting Korea and Vietnam, the broad masses of people warmly support the convening of the Peace Conference and actively prepare to participate in the conference; in Vietnam, even the people in the French-occupied areas held gatherings in support of the Peace Conference. In Mongolia, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Nepal, and other Asian countries and Australia, New Zealand, and Latin American countries, the broad masses of people support the convening of the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, and they are actively electing representatives to attend the Peace Conference; students in Sydney, Australia, have organized a "Strive to go to Beijing Committee." The enthusiasm and efforts of the people of various countries are a strong guarantee for the victory and success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

The peace movement in the Asian and Pacific regions is inseparable from the world peace movement. In a recent letter to the National Peace Committees of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the Secretariat of the World Peace Council pointed out: "The peace work in the Asian and Pacific regions is an important part of the entire world peace work, and the successful holding of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will greatly help the preparations for the World People's Peace Congress in December this year." At present, the peace organizations and all peace-loving people in the Asian and Pacific regions are striving to further advance the peace movement in this region, create conditions for the victory and success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and further welcome the convening of the World People's Peace Congress.

专栏：国际述评

    继续加强和巩固中苏两国的伟大同盟
    以我中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来为首的我国政府代表团于本月十七日到达了莫斯科，受到苏联政府热烈盛大的欢迎。苏联部长会议副主席莫洛托夫、米高扬和布尔加宁、苏联外交部部长维辛斯基、苏联对外贸易部部长库米金等，以及各人民民主国家和许多亚洲国家驻莫斯科的外交使节，都曾到莫斯科中央飞机场欢迎我国政府代表团。
    我政府代表团的组成如下：首席代表周恩来；代表陈云、李富春、张闻天、粟裕；顾问王鹤寿、陈郁、宋劭文、刘亚楼、罗舜初、邱创成、汪道涵、王诤、师哲、徐以新、陈家康。
    我政府代表团首席代表周恩来总理于抵达莫斯科时在飞机场上发表的谈话中指出：“中华人民共和国政府代表团这次来到莫斯科，是为了继续加强两国之间的友好合作，并商谈各种有关问题。”这在中苏两国友好关系的历史上无疑是具有重大意义的。
    中苏两大国于一九五○年二月签订了友好同盟互助条约，从而结成了永久的、牢不可破的兄弟同盟。两年多以来的事实说明：中苏两国的伟大同盟对保障远东及世界的和平与安全已发生了极其伟大的作用。正因为如此，一切爱好和平的人民都以最大的热情，欢呼苏联人民在和平建设中的辉煌成就。这种成就大大地增加了保卫世界和平的力量，并无限地鼓舞着各国人民争取和平斗争的胜利信心。与此同时，中国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，在建设伟大祖国的工作中，也获得了重大的成就，并使国家的力量大大增强。中国人民的这种成就与苏联政府和人民的大公无私的热情援助是分不开的。由于这种缘故，中苏两国的伟大同盟两年多以来是更加巩固和强大了。
    我国政府代表团到莫斯科与苏联政府之间的会谈，对于中苏两国友好关系的继续发展，对于中苏两国人民的和平建设事业，对于全世界人民的和平建设事业，无疑都将有极为重要的作用和贡献。
    苏联人民向共产主义前进
    八月二十日，苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会发布了由斯大林同志签署的关于召开第十九次代表大会的声明。声明中决定代表大会召开的日期是一九五二年十月五日，并规定了代表大会的议程和代表的选举程序。同时，苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会并公布了关于一九五一——一九五五年苏联发展五年计划的指示草案，和关于党章的修正草案。
    自一九三九年苏联共产党召开第十八次代表大会以来，已经过去十三年了。在这一时期中，苏联人民在伟大的斯大林和布尔什维克党的领导下，在人类历史上写下了光荣的篇页。苏联人民在史无前例的伟大的卫国战争中，曾付出了巨大的代价，捍卫了社会主义祖国，并从法西斯魔爪下拯救了人类的文明，赢得了世界的和平与进步。在战后，苏联人民专心一意、坚定不移地从事和平建设，完成了战后第一个五年计划，使国民经济恢复并大大超过了战前水平。规模宏大的共产主义建设工程，正在伏尔加河、顿河、第聂伯河和阿姆河上全力进行着。苏联人民对法西斯的历史性胜利，战后和平劳动的伟大成就，以及始终不渝地坚持和平外交政策，给国际生活带来巨大的深刻的影响。事实日益证明着：苏联是全世界人民的希望和灯塔，是和平民主的强大堡垒。苏联人民的这些胜利和成就，是共产主义思想的无敌力量的光辉证明，是布尔什维克党的强大生命力的光辉证明。
    为了迎接苏联共产党的第十九次代表大会，在辽阔广大的苏联国土上，现在正到处掀起了无可比拟的劳动热潮和政治热潮。在列宁—斯大林党教养下的千百万苏联人民，正以新的劳动成就贡献给党的代表大会。准备在党的代表大会上讨论并通过的第五个五年计划，在苏联人民面前展开了一片光明灿烂、幸福无疆的远景。计划草案规定，一九五五年苏联工业生产水平要比一九五零年提高约百分之七十，谷物总产量要增加百分之四十到五十，国民收入至少增加百分之六十。正如“真理报”所称：
    “第五个五年计划预示着苏联国民经济将有新的、巨大的高涨，并保证人民的物质福利与文化水平将有进一步的、显著的提高。”这个计划的完成，无疑会使苏联从社会主义向共产主义前进一大步。
    中国人民和全世界进步人民正在注视着苏联人民在伟大的布尔什维克党领导下走向共产主义的每一步伐，倾听着他们在和平劳动战线上的每一捷音。苏联人民和平劳动的每一成就，都是对爱好和平人民的鼓舞，都是对帝国主义战争贩子的打击。一切爱好和平和相信人类美好未来的人们，都对苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的召开，寄以极大的关怀，并将从中汲取无穷的鼓舞力量。
    迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平
    会议
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的成功，给予这一区域各国人民保卫和平的斗争以极大的鼓舞。目前，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民正在展开广泛热烈的活动，以迎接即将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的各国代表返国后，曾通过报纸、记者招待会和各种群众性的集会，向人民广泛传达了筹备会议的成就，使各国人民深切地认识到：要拯救亚洲及太平洋区域的和平与全世界的和平，就必须团结各国所有的爱好和平的人民，对战争挑拨者进行不懈的斗争。这对于推动各国人民保卫和平运动起了重要的作用。各国代表在传达筹备会议情况的同时，并报告了他们亲眼看到的新中国进行和平建设的巨大成就，以及美国进行细菌战的罪证。这使各国人民进一步认识到保卫和平的迫切性和重要性。
    由于各国和平战士的广泛活动，筹备参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的运动，已在各国人民中发生了巨大的影响。苏联人民热烈拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，在苏联的报刊上，广播上和会议上，广泛地讨论着这一会议议程上的一切问题。在印度和日本，和平运动比过去任何时期都要高涨。在各种和平组织和群众团体加强团结的基础上，印度的和平运动正迅速而广泛地发展起来。印度全国各地从八月三日至十日举行了“亚洲周”。在加尔各答、孟买、马德拉斯、朱龙多以及其他许多城市和乡村，和平拥护者利用逐屋宣传、开讨论会和举行公众集会等方式，广泛地宣传了召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的重大意义，并号召全国人民作好筹备工作。印度东旁遮普省等地工会组织先后召开和平会议，推选出席代表。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议全印赞助人大会也将于九月九日召开，讨论参加和平会议的筹备工作，并将拟定向和平会议提出的提案。日本拥护和平委员会在各工会、民主团体和社会名流的支持下，已发起自六月二十五日起至八月十五日止的“和平运动月”，规定要展开一个以拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议为目标的国民运动。日本各地推选代表的活动正在热烈进行，目前选出的代表候选人已达二百多人。在战斗的朝鲜和越南，广大的人民都热烈拥护和平会议的召开，并积极筹备参加大会的工作；在越南，甚至法占领区的人民也举行了支持和平会议的集会。在蒙古、缅甸、高棉、印尼、巴基斯坦、锡兰和尼泊尔等其他亚洲国家和澳洲、新西兰、拉丁美洲各国，广大人民都支持召开亚洲及太平洋和平会议，他们正积极推选出席和平会议的代表；澳大利亚悉尼的学生并组织了“争取赴北京委员会”。各国人民的热情和努力，是使亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议获得胜利和成功的有力保证。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国的和平运动是与世界和平运动分不开的。世界和平理事会书记处在最近发出的致参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各国和平委员会的信中指出：“亚洲及太平洋区域和平工作是整个世界和平工作中重要的一部分，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议能够胜利地开好，对于今年十二月世界人民和平大会的准备工作，也有很大的帮助。”目前，亚洲及太平洋区域各国的和平组织和所有爱好和平的人民，正努力把这一区域的和平运动向前推进一步，为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的胜利和成功创造条件，并进一步迎接世界人民和平大会的召开。
