    Xinhua News Agency, 4th. London dispatch: Britain's serious economic crisis has forced the Conservative government to decide to reduce Britain's expansion plan and shift forces to increase exports to avoid the ever-increasing trade deficit leading Britain to economic bankruptcy.
    This decision by the Conservative government was announced to Parliament by British Prime Minister Churchill on July 30th. Churchill said: "Generally speaking, the decision we have made will change military production, limit the demands of military production on the machinery industry, and in the coming years enable a valuable part of the productivity of the machinery industry to be freed up to expand our exports of civilian goods." Churchill admitted that years of military expansion and war preparation had damaged Britain's economic lifeline. Continuing in this way would only make Britain weaker and weaker. He said: "Without a solid economic foundation, a lasting military force cannot be guaranteed, and a defense plan cannot stand without economic resources to implement it."
    Despite this, Churchill still stated that he would try his best to carry out the U.S.-ordered expansion plan. He guaranteed that Britain would "stand shoulder to shoulder" with the United States and other "allies" in Europe. He refused to specify to what extent Britain's expansion plan would be reduced, but he said that the original 4.7 billion pound expansion plan, scheduled to be completed in three years, would be extended to four to five years.
    Before Churchill announced the above decision, the British Parliament had conducted two days of discussion on Britain's critical economic situation, and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler reported to the members of Parliament. In his report, Butler stated that in addition to cutting military production, the Conservative government would also sell more British military supplies to foreign countries in exchange for food and raw material imports. In addition, the Conservative government also decided to further reduce imports (including already repeatedly reduced food imports and industrial products such as paper, pulp, and tobacco), and decided to continue to implement the policy of effectively freezing British workers' wages. In his report, Butler, as usual, asked workers to step up production, strive to save, and endure sacrifices.
    From these measures of the Conservative government, the severity of the British economic crisis can be clearly seen. Churchill said: "We must now report to the Lower House and the world that our financial reserves are being further tightened." Britain's current gold reserves are less than 1.7 billion U.S. dollars, which makes Britain "helpless and too easily at the mercy of unexpected events occurring abroad." Churchill also said: "It is a tragedy for the United Kingdom and the Dominions that a once-mighty British Empire, which is still quite large, must worry about how we can pay the bills every month. I fully admit that I am distressed by the thoughts and developments I see around me."

    Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Paris dispatch: France recently requested the United States to give French industry 623 million U.S. dollars in military orders in the next three years so that France can obtain the U.S. dollars that are increasingly depleted in the current trade crisis to maintain French industrial and military production. However, the United States formally rejected France's request on July 30 because of insufficient financial resources. This incident reflects that the North Atlantic Group's war preparation plan has encountered a new crisis.
    The French request was personally submitted by French Prime Minister Pinay to U.S. Ambassador Dunn in a memorandum on July 21. According to Agence France-Presse, the memorandum emphasized that if the United States does not give France this batch of orders, French factories will close down. "In this way, it may bring serious difficulties to the country and society. At that time, France may be in a position to have to reconsider its expansion plan."
    Since February this year, when the United States decided at the Lisbon meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Council to have France spend 1.4 trillion francs in 1952 to expand its military and prepare for war, the then French Faure government, which was already deeply mired in economic and political crises, wanted to raise this huge amount by increasing taxes. The result was that it was overthrown due to strong opposition. Later, its successor, the Pinay government, used a series of methods such as desperately cutting civil affairs expenditures, industrial construction costs, social insurance funds, and issuing public debt indiscriminately, but still could not raise enough war expenditure. French Air Force Chief of Staff Mondel admitted to the National Assembly in June: "Now there is a clear imbalance between our military burden and the country's financial capacity."
    In this case, the only hope of the Pinay government was that the Americans would quickly fulfill the promise they had made at the Lisbon meeting to give France huge military orders. Many French officials have repeatedly revealed this anxious mood. For example, Air Force Chief of Staff Mondel said on June 18: If there are no orders, the air force business may decline. On July 25, Defense Minister Pleven also said: "In order to develop or maintain our military strength, the issue of overseas orders must be resolved. I hope the highest authorities in Washington pay attention to these issues."
    However, the Washington authorities did not satisfy the hopes of the Paris authorities. In a reply delivered by U.S. Ambassador Dunn to the French government on July 25, it only promised to give France 185 million U.S. dollars in orders. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson said on July 30 that Washington was forced to do so because Truman's original request for "foreign aid" appropriations had been greatly reduced by Congress—from 7.9498 billion U.S. dollars to 6.03194 billion U.S. dollars.
    Associated Press said: "The US decision greatly surprised the French government... Newspapers and social people were also shocked by it. The newspapers said that in this way, France will not be able to fulfill its promise at the Lisbon meeting to equip and establish ten new divisions. Newspapers said: Several French military equipment factories will have to close, and at least 25,000 people will lose their jobs as a result."
    Judging from the current situation in Western Europe, "not being able to fulfill the promises at the Lisbon meeting" is not limited to France. Agence France-Presse issued a telegram from Washington on July 24, saying: "Well-informed sources here hint that senior US government leaders may want to revise the military expansion plans of the North Atlantic countries, because this plan is considered too large... It is clear that the North Atlantic Treaty member states cannot establish 50 divisions, nor can they obtain 4,000 aircraft in 1952... The impact of the US Congress's reduction of foreign aid appropriations, the Korean War, and the US steel strike have all made the current situation more complicated."

    北大西洋侵略集团备战计划遭到严重危机
    英法两政府供认深陷在经济危机中无力完成美国扩军命令
    【新华社四日讯】伦敦消息：英国严重的经济危机已迫使保守党政府不得不决定缩小英国的扩军计划，转移力量来增加出口，以免一天大似一天的入超把英国导向经济破产。
    保守党政府的这个决定，是英国首相邱吉尔于七月三十日向议会宣布的。邱吉尔说：“一般说来，我们所作的决定将改变军事生产，限制军事生产对机器工业的要求，并在今后几年中使机器工业的生产力能腾出有价值的一部分来扩充我们民用品的出口。”邱吉尔承认，几年来扩军备战已经损害了英国的经济命根。这样下去只能使英国日趋孱弱。他说：“如果没有稳固的经济基础，就不能保证持久的军事力量，而防务计划如果没有经济资源来贯彻实行，也就站不住脚。”
    尽管如此，邱吉尔却仍然表示它还要竭力把美国命令的扩军计划执行到底。他保证英国要和美国以及其他在欧洲的“盟国”“肩并肩地站在一起”。他拒绝具体说明，英国的扩军计划将缩减到什么程度，不过他说，原定三年完成的四十七亿英镑扩军计划，将延长到四年至五年才能完成。
    在邱吉尔宣布上项决定以前，英国议会已对英国危急的经济情势进行了两天的讨论，英国财政大臣巴特勒向议员们作了报告。巴特勒在报告中表示：保守党政府除削减军火生产外，还要把更多的英国军火出售给外国，以换取粮食与原料进口。此外，保守党政府还决定进一步削减进口（其中包括已经一再减少的食物进口和纸张、纸浆、烟草等项工业品的进口），决定继续实行实际上冻结英国工人工资的政策。巴特勒在报告中和往常一样地要求工人加紧增加生产，努力节约，忍受牺牲。
    从保守党政府的这些措施中，可以明显地看出英国经济危机的严重性。邱吉尔说：“我们现在要向下院和全世界报告，我们的财政储备已在进一步抽紧”。英国目前的黄金储备不足十七亿美元，这使英国“毫无办法，太易于听凭国外发生的意外事件所摆布”。邱吉尔又说：“一个一度是气焰万丈而目前仍然是相当庞大的不列颠帝国必须担心我们如何能支付每个月的账单，这对于联合王国与各自治领说来实在是一个悲剧，我完全承认：我为我在四周所见的思想和事态发展而苦恼。”
    【新华社四日讯】巴黎消息：法国最近要求美国在今后三年给法国工业以六亿二千三百万美元的军火订货，以便法国能得到它在目前的贸易危机中日趋耗竭的美元，来维持法国的工业与军事生产。但是，美国因为财力不足已在七月三十日正式拒绝了法国的要求。这一件事反映了北大西洋集团的备战计划已遭到了新的危机。
    法国的要求是由法国总理比内在七月二十一日亲自以备忘录方式提交美国大使邓恩的。据法新社透露，这个备忘录强调：如果美国不给法国这批订单，法国的工厂就要倒闭。“这样，就可能带给国家和社会方面严重的困难。那时，法国就可能处于不得不重新考虑扩军计划的境地。”
    自从今年二月间，美国在北大西洋公约理事会里斯本会议上决定要法国在一九五二年度拿出一万四千亿法郎来扩军备战以后，当时已经深陷在经济危机和政治危机之中的法国富尔政府想用增税的办法来筹措这笔巨额费用，结果因为遭到强大的反对而倒了台。后来它的继任者比内政府就使用了拚命削减民政开支、工业建设费用、社会保险经费和滥发公债等一连串办法，但是仍然无法筹足这笔战争开支。法国国防部空军总长蒙代尔六月间在国民议会承认：“现在我们的军事负担和国家的财政能力之间有着显明的不平衡。”
    在这种情况下，比内政府唯一的指望就是：美国人赶快实践它在里斯本会议上曾经答应过要给法国巨额军火订货的诺言。法国许多官员都一再流露出这种操切的心情。例如空军总长蒙代尔在六月十八日就说：如果没有订货，空军事业就可能倒退。七月二十五日，国防部长普利文也说：“为了发展或维持我们的军事力量，必须解决海外订货问题。我希望华盛顿最高当局注意这些问题。”
    但是，华盛顿当局却没有满足巴黎当局的希望。在由美国大使邓恩七月二十五日交给法国政府的覆文中，它只答应给法国一亿八千五百万美元的订货。美国国务卿艾奇逊在七月三十日表示，华盛顿这样作是不得已的，因为杜鲁门原来所要求的“援外”拨款已经被国会大大削减——从七十九亿四千九百八十万美元削减到六十亿三千一百九十四万美元了。
    美联社说：“美国的决定使法国政府大吃一惊。……报纸和社会人士也为之震惊。各报都说：这样一来，法国就不能履行在里斯本会议上的诺言，装备并建立十个新的师了。报纸说：有几家法国军备工厂只好关门，至少有二万五千人因此失业。”
    从目前西欧的情形看来，“不能履行在里斯本会议上的诺言”的还不止法国一国。法新社在七月二十四日从华盛顿发出的一条电讯说：“此间消息灵通人士暗示：美国政府高级领袖们可能要修改北大西洋各国的扩军计划，因为这个计划被人认为太大了。……很清楚地，北大西洋公约成员国不可能建立五十个师，也不可能在一九五二年获得四千架飞机。……美国国会的削减援外拨款、朝鲜战争和美国钢铁罢工的影响，都使目前形势更加错综复杂。”
