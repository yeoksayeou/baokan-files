    The Phenomenon of Falsely Reporting Achievements Must Be Thoroughly Eliminated
    Comrade Editor: The South Station Repair Shop of the Shijiazhuang Vehicle Depot, during a recent work inspection, discovered that the phenomenon of falsely reporting achievements in the past among Groups A, B, and C was very serious. For example, some only wrote the vehicle number and added work afterward; some, because they had no work to do, took materials but couldn't use them, so to account for them and complete the task, they hid the materials; some also wrote work done on one vehicle under multiple vehicle numbers.
    The reason why the repair shop's groups falsely reported achievements is that, in addition to serious ideological errors on the part of the personnel involved, it is inseparable from the bureaucratic approach of the leadership. Some leading cadres do not go deep into the field to inspect work, but are satisfied with the achievements reported from below. For example, after a group leader is on duty, they report the progress of completing targets to the foreman. After listening to the report, the foreman does not ask how it was completed or whether it is true, and blindly praises the group for completing or exceeding the target. For groups that have not completed the target, they do not understand the reasons why they cannot complete the target, and simply criticize them. More seriously, some leading cadres know that the accounts reported from below are false, but do not immediately correct them. Therefore, in order to avoid criticism, the workers try various ways to falsely report achievements.
    After this inspection, the leading cadres of the repair shop and the relevant personnel of each group have conducted self-criticisms, and pledged to conduct in-depth work inspections in the future, establish a spirit of being earnestly responsible to the country and the people, and thoroughly eradicate the bad practice of falsely reporting achievements.　Xiao Guo

    应彻底消灭假报成绩的现象
    编辑同志：石家庄车辆段南站检修所，在最近检查工作的时候，发现过去甲、乙、丙三班假报成绩的现象非常严重。例如有的只写车号，事后添活；有的因没有活做，领来材料以后用不出去，为了出账好完成任务，就把材料藏起来了；也有把在一个车上干的活多写几个车号的。
    检修所各班所以假报成绩，除有关人员有严重的错误思想外，是和领导方面的官僚主义分不开的。某些领导干部不深入现场检查工作，满足于下面所报的成绩。如小组长值班后，向工长汇报完成指标的情况，工长听完汇报后，不问是怎么完成的，是否真实，就盲目地表扬完成或超过指标的小组。对于没有完成指标的小组，也没有了解其不能完成指标的原因，就予以批评。更严重的是，有些领导干部明知下面报的是假账，也不立即纠正。因此，工人们为避免受批评，就想种种办法来假报成绩。
    经过这次检查以后，检修所的领导干部和各班的有关人员，都进行了检讨，并保证以后深入地检查工作，树立起对国家人民认真负责的作风，以彻底铲除假报成绩的恶劣作风。　小郭
