To our beloved Chairman Mao: We are the 470 undergraduate and special course graduates of Northeast Normal University this year. We are writing this letter to express our joy and to make a guarantee to you.

Beloved Chairman Mao! It is you and the Party who have opened up infinitely broad prospects for us young people, enabling each of us to contribute our talents to the motherland and the people. You are like our loving parents, deeply concerned about our studies and health, and demanding that we become teachers of the new China. Each of us is determined to be a good son and daughter of Mao Zedong and a good student of Mao Zedong.

On the eve of the motherland's large-scale economic construction, we will undertake the task of developing secondary education, educating young people for the motherland, and cultivating intermediate construction talents and primary school teachers. We recognize the arduousness of this task, and we also feel its greatness and glory.

We have completed our preparations before departure and are quietly awaiting your instructions and summons. Here, let us solemnly swear to you and the Party:

	We guarantee to unconditionally and consciously obey the organization's assignments, whether it is in the city or the countryside, whether it is in the Central Plains or the frontier, we will go wherever we are needed.

	We guarantee to do a good job as teachers for life, and we will never waver.

	We will intensify our self-transformation, work hard to study, and make ourselves people's teachers with a firm communist world outlook and mastery of Marxist-Leninist weapons.

	We will inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of the Chinese nation and Chinese youth, give full play to our initiative and creativity, overcome all difficulties, and use revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to complete all the tasks you and the Party have entrusted to us.

	All graduates of the 1952 summer term of Northeast Normal University
