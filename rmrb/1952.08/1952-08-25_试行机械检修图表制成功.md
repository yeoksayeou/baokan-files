    Successful Trial of Mechanical Repair Chart System

    Editor: The 808 Mechanical Mining Area of the No. 5 Well of the Datong Coal Mine No. 2 Mine has successfully trialed a mechanical repair chart system.

    In the mining area of a coal mine, the safe operation of machinery is extremely important. If a piece of machinery fails, production in the entire area will stop. In the past, due to poor organization, a lack of planning before each day's work, and a lack of responsibility on the part of some repair personnel, mechanical accidents frequently occurred. In June alone, there were 26 such incidents.

    After the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign in July, the electrical and mechanical technician of this area, Ren Binggang (a member of the Communist Youth League), and the leading cadres of the area, drawing on the experience of the mechanical repair responsibility system of the No. 3 Air Shaft of the No. 2 Mine, and based on the principles of the chart system, studied with the workers and created a method of carrying out repairs according to a chart. After three tests and revisions, it has been successfully trialed.

    The repair chart system is a method of carrying out repair work rhythmically according to when each part of the machine should be repaired and the time required for each repair task. They numbered all twelve repair workers in the area and wrote them on the chart. After the workers go down the well, they complete their tasks according to the work specified below their number. After one task is completed, they proceed to another task indicated on the chart. This overcomes the past phenomenon of the team leader temporarily assigning work after going down the well, which wasted time, and at the same time strengthens the workers' sense of responsibility. As a result, the number of mechanical accidents in July decreased by 82 percent compared to June, and twelve repair workers were also saved (originally twenty-four). Ma Liang

    试行机械检修图表制成功
    编辑同志：大同煤矿第二矿五号井八○八机械回采区，试行机械检修图表制成功。
    在煤矿的回采区内，机械的安全运转是十分重要的。一件机械发生故障，全区生产就会停止。过去这个区由于组织的不周密，每天工作事先缺乏计划，以及某些检修人员责任心不强，经常发生机械事故，仅六月份就发生二十六次。
    七月份展开增产节约运动后，这个区的机电技术员任秉刚（青年团员）和区的领导干部，吸取了二矿三号风井机械检修专责制的经验，根据图表制的原理，和工人们互相研究，创造出一种按图表进行检修的办法。经过三次测定和修改，已经试验成功。
    检修图表制是按照各部机器应该在什么时候检修和每一件检修工作所需要的时间，有节奏地进行检修工作。他们把全区十二个检修工人编成号码，写在图表上，工人们下井后就按照号码下面规定的工作完成自己的任务。待一件工作完成后，就又按照表上指示的另一个任务进行工作。这样做，克服了过去下井后由组长临时分配工作以致浪费时间的现象，同时加强了工人们的责任心。因此，七月份的机械事故比六月份减少百分之八十二，还节省了十二个检修工（原来二十四个）。　马　良
