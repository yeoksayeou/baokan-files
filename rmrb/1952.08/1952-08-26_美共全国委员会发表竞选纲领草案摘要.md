    Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 24th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on August 24th: The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States has announced that the Communist Party will hold a one-day representative meeting in New York on September 6th to discuss the Communist Party's 1952 election campaign.

    The National Committee's statement said that the Communist Party will nominate candidates to participate in the election of local public officials in New York State, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and certain other states.

    The National Committee released to the press a summary of the draft platform for the 1952 election, which put forward the party's basic demands regarding foreign and domestic policy.

    The Communist Party believes that "the overwhelming majority of the American people demand peace and the establishment of friendly relations with all countries in the world," and therefore demands: an immediate ceasefire in Korea; a declaration that atomic bombs and germ warfare are illegal; the abandonment of American military bases in Japan; the withdrawal of occupying forces from Japan; the establishment of a unified and democratic Germany; and the establishment of normal trade relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies. The Communist Party demands: the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact to resolve differences between the United States and the Soviet Union through negotiation, and the unconditional granting of independence to Puerto Rico.

    In terms of domestic policy, the Communist Party suggests abolishing the McCarran Act and the reactionary Taft-Hartley Act, declaring amnesty for all political prisoners, and simultaneously demanding the passage of laws prohibiting the persecution of Black people and other religions and races.

    For the sake of peace and to defend the living standards of American workers and farmers, the Communist Party demands an end to all forms of peacetime conscription; the restoration of a peacetime economy and the cancellation of war preparations expenditures.

    In order to combat corruption within government institutions, the Communist Party demands the establishment of an investigative body to help eliminate all corruption at all levels of government.

    The Communist Party platform concludes: "The greatest task of the American people is to fight against the danger of war and fascism, and to strive for peace and democracy."

    在国内政策方面，共产党建议废除麦卡伦法和反动的塔夫脱—哈特莱法，宣布大赦一切政治犯，同时要求通过法律，禁止对黑人和其它宗教和种族的迫害。
    为了和平的利益并保卫美国工人和农民的生活水准，共产党要求停止各种形式的和平时期征兵；恢复平时经济并取消备战的开支。
    为了与政府机构内的贪污现象作斗争，共产党要求成立一个调查机构，来帮助肃清政府各级机构中的一切贪污现象。
    共产党纲领结语说：“美国人民的最大的任务是为反对战争和法西斯主义的危险，为争取和平与民主而斗争。”
