In response, our chief representative, General Nam Il, lodged a serious protest with the U.S. side again on the 28th. The full text of the protest is as follows:

To: Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation, Major General Harrison:

　　According to your recent reports, in August, your side killed five and wounded sixty-four of our captured personnel, an increase of four deaths and twelve injuries compared to the figures initially acknowledged by your side. In response, I lodge a serious protest with your side and demand that your side clearly inform us of the exact number of our captured personnel killed and wounded by your side. Your side must immediately cease this brutal and cowardly behavior of completely tearing up the 1949 Geneva Convention, and provide a complete and responsible account of every incident of prisoner of war abuse and killing.

    南日将军再度抗议美方屠杀战俘
    【新华社开城二十八日电】八月十一日以来，美方连续屠杀我方被俘人员。据美方报道透露，我方被俘人员死伤数字已增加至六十九人。为此，我方首席代表南日将军二十八日向美方再度提出严重抗议。抗议全文如下：
    联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊少将：
  　根据你方最近的报道，八月份内你方打死我方被俘人员五人，打伤六十四人，比较你方最初所承认的数字增加死者四人，伤者十二人。对此，我向你方提出严重抗议，并要你方明告我方，你方究竟打死打伤了多少我方被俘人员。你方必须立即停止这种彻底撕毁一九四九年日内瓦公约的残暴卑怯行为，并对每一次虐杀战俘事件作完全和负责的交代。
　　朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    一九五二年八月二十八日
