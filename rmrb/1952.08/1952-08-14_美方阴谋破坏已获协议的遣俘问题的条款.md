Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 13th: A special correspondent for this agency reports: Harrison's refusal to fulfill Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement concerning the release and repatriation of all prisoners of war demonstrates to the world that, despite agreement reached by both sides on all clauses in the draft agreement, the US side is still plotting to obstruct the signing of the armistice agreement. At the second delegation conference held this month, General Nam Il emphasized that the last remaining question was whether the US representative was “truly sincere in fulfilling the agreed-upon clauses regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war and achieving a Korean armistice."

On the 11th, Harrison reiterated his old tune of sabotaging the negotiations by saying "I have nothing to say," causing the meeting to recess again for a week, to reconvene on August 19th. But this time, he revealed the US side's conspiracy to undermine the agreed-upon clauses regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war.

Harrison said he was "prepared to act according to the terms of Article 51." Article 51 states: "Upon the coming into effect of this Armistice Agreement, both sides shall forthwith release and repatriate all prisoners of war then held by them." However, he then contradicted himself by saying that only 83,000 Korean and Chinese POWs would be repatriated.

Harrison emphasized the words "Upon the coming into effect of this Armistice Agreement," but dared not offer further explanation, further exposing the US side's deceitful conspiracy. Behind these vile, roundabout words lies the shameless plot of the US side to forcibly detain 20 percent of the Korean People's Army POWs and 68 percent of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs who are from North Korea, and hand them over to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, the sworn enemies of the Korean and Chinese people. According to Clark headquarters in Tokyo, 27,000 Korean People's Army prisoners of war have already been unilaterally "released" in South Korea, which is in fact a transfer of these prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee gang.

Clearly, the US side's conspiracy of playing with the lives of prisoners of war is easily exposed, whether at the conference table or outside the conference tent. This explains why Harrison hastily requested a recess after a thirty-five-minute meeting. He said: "Since neither of us is changing our position, there seems to be no reason to hold plenary meetings every day." But the fact is that the US side is conspiring to play tricks with the wording of the agreed-upon clauses of the draft armistice agreement, and is attempting to strangle the hope of a Korean armistice. This is something that a recess cannot hide.

### 美方阴谋破坏已获协议的遣俘问题的条款

    美方阴谋破坏已获协议的遣俘问题的条款
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者报道：哈利逊拒绝履行停战协定草案中关于释放和遣返全部战俘问题的第五十一款。这种行为使全世界都看到了：尽管协定草案中的各款都已得到双方同意，可是美方仍在阴谋阻挠停战协定的签订。在本月举行的第二次代表团大会上，南日将军曾强调指出，剩下的最后一个问题是美方代表是否“真有诚意履行已得协议的关于遣返战俘问题的各款，实现朝鲜停战”。
    十一日，哈利逊又重弹他那破坏谈判的老调说：“我没有话说”，使会议再次休会一个星期，到八月十九日再开。但是这一次他揭开了美方企图破坏已得协议的关于遣返战俘问题的各款的阴谋。
    哈利逊说，他“准备照着第五十一款的条文行事”。第五十一款写道：“在本停战协定生效时，双方应尽速释放和遣返各自拘留的全部战俘。”可是他随即自相矛盾地说，只有八万三千名朝中战俘将被遣返。
    哈利逊强调“本停战协定生效时”这几个字，但又不敢作进一步的解释，这就更加暴露了美方的欺骗阴谋。在这种卑鄙的转弯抹角的话后面，掩藏着的是美方企图强迫扣留家在朝鲜北部的百分之二十的朝鲜人民军战俘和百分之六十八的中国人民志愿军战俘，并把他们交给朝中人民的死敌李承晚和台湾的蒋介石的无耻勾当。据东京的克拉克总部说，朝鲜人民军被俘人员已有二万七千人在朝鲜南部片面“释放”，实际上就是把这些被俘人员移交给李承晚匪帮。
    显然，美方以战俘生命玩弄阴谋的勾当，无论是在会议桌上，或是在会议帐篷外，都是一戳就破的。这就说明为什么哈利逊开了三十五分钟的会，就慌慌忙忙地要求全体会议休会。他说：“既然我们都不改变我们的主张，似乎没有理由每天举行全体会议。”但是，事实是美方阴谋对停战协定草案业经获致协议的条款在文字上耍花样，并正在企图借此扼杀朝鲜停战的希望。这是休会也掩盖不了的。
