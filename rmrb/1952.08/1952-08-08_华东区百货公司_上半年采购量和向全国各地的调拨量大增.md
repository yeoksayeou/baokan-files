    East China District Department Store
    Greatly Increases Procurement and Allocation to All Parts of the Country in the First Half of the Year

    The East China District Company of the state-owned China Department Store Company, the main procurement station for domestic daily-use general merchandise, has greatly increased the quantity of general merchandise purchased in Shanghai and allocated to all parts of the country this year. According to statistics, in the first half of this year, the value of general merchandise allocated by the East China District Company of the China Department Store Company has increased by more than double compared with the first half of last year, and is still continuing to increase. The value of general merchandise allocated by the East China District Company in the second quarter increased by 97% compared with the first quarter, and from July 1st to the 29th, it had already increased by 27.82% compared with June. The allocation volume of some autumn goods greatly exceeded last year. For example, wool yarn increased by nearly two times compared with the first half of last year, towels increased by nearly 1.3 times, toothpaste increased by 2.5 times, and soap increased by more than 10 times.

    In March of this year, the East China District Company of the China Department Store Company implemented the policy of "'Five-Anti' Movement without hindering production," and expanded processing, ordering, and procurement business for private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Starting in May, it further signed long-term ordering contracts and long-term exclusive sales contracts with more than 300 private factories in more than 20 industries. Therefore, the total value of goods purchased by the East China District Company of the China Department Store Company in Shanghai in the first half of the year increased by 1.26 times compared with the same period last year. After April, under the unified dispatch of the head office of the China Department Store Company, the East China District Company of the China Department Store Company increased the allocation volume to department stores in all parts of the country, and as a result, most of the non-branded goods and slow-selling goods purchased since March to take care of private enterprises were also allocated.

    In order to support state-owned department stores in various regions in launching industrial product promotion campaigns, the East China District Company of the China Department Store Company is working hard to improve procurement and allocation work. For example, when the representative of a department store from another region stationed in the East China District Company requests a certain brand of goods that cannot be purchased, the East China District Company tries its best to satisfy them with other brands of goods of the same quality, and invites them to visit samples and introduces the quality and specifications of these goods to them. This enables the purchasing plans of foreign companies to be completed on time. In terms of allocation procedures, in the past, after representatives of department stores from various regions requested certain goods, the East China District Company generally took more than five days to deliver the goods to the transportation department for shipment. Since July, due to system improvements, it can generally be done in only four days. In August, it will continue to improve and strive to do it in no more than three days. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 华东区百货公司  上半年采购量和向全国各地的调拨量大增

    华东区百货公司
    上半年采购量和向全国各地的调拨量大增
    国营中国百货公司国内日用百货的主要采购站——华东区公司，今年在上海采购百货的数量和向全国各地调拨的数量大大增加。据统计：今年上半年，中国百货公司华东区公司已调拨的百货的金额比去年上半年增加一倍多，目前仍在继续增加中。华东区公司第二季度调出百货金额比第一季增加百分之九十七，七月份到二十九日止，就已比六月份增加百分之二十七点八二。有些秋令商品调出量大大超过去年，如毛线比去年上半年增加近两倍，毛巾增加近一点三倍，牙膏增加两倍半，香皂增加十倍以上。
    今年三月间，中国百货公司华东区公司执行“‘五反’生产两不误”的方针，对有利于国计民生的私营工业扩大加工、订货、收购业务，五月份起，更进一步和二十多个行业中的三百多家私营工厂订立长期订货合同与长期包销合同。因此，中国百货公司华东区公司上半年在上海市进货总金额比去年同期增加一点二六倍。四月份以后，在中国百货公司总公司统一调度下，中国百货公司华东区公司对全国各地百货公司增加了调拨量，且因此连三月份以来为照顾私营企业而收购的非名牌货和滞销商品，也大部调出。
    中国百货公司华东区公司为了支持各地国营百货公司展开工业品推销运动，正努力改进采购工作和调拨工作。例如：外区百货公司驻华东区公司代表所要求的某种牌号商品无法购到时，华东区公司便尽量以质量相同的其他牌号商品来满足他们，并请他们参观样品，向他们介绍这些商品的质量、规格。这样就使外区公司的进货计划能按时完成。在调拨手续上，过去各地百货公司代表提出要求某种商品后，华东区公司一般总要五天以上的时间才能将货物送到运输部门启运。七月份起，由于制度改进，一般能做到只需四天时间。八月份将继续改进，争取做到不超过三天。（新华社）
