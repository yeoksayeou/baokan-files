    The Party Organization of Fengtai Locomotive Depot Persisted in Leading the Ideological Struggle Against Xi Neng'an
    Chen Chunsen
    The primary-level Party organization of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau conducted a series of serious struggles against Xi Neng'an, the former head of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, for his erroneous thinking of deviating from the leadership of the Party in production management, and his shameful behavior of jointly falsely reporting achievements with Li Yonglu to fraudulently obtain the title of meritorious worker.
    As early as 1950, when Li Yonglu went to the Tianjin Railway Administration and the Ministry of Railways to "report his merits," workers were secretly discussing: "What meritorious model! Isn't it just that whoever the depot chief wants to be a model becomes a model!" This criticism was valid, but unfortunately, it did not attract the attention of the Party branch and the leadership at the time. During the cadre rectification campaign in September 1950, Party members and the masses of workers raised more than 400 opinions to leaders such as Xi Neng'an, but they did not attract the attention of the leadership. From that time on, Xi Neng'an adopted an attitude of malicious retaliation and suppression towards the Party's general branch and branch. He consciously wooed some people, formed a kind of force, controlled the leadership of the Party, government, and trade union, acted arbitrarily, distorted the principles of the Party, groundlessly insisted that the deputy secretary of the general branch, Guo Fushun, was "taking over administrative work," and blamed the secretary of the general branch, Wang Rong, for launching the masses to make suggestions.
    Seeing that Xi Neng'an's problem was quite complicated, the Party general branch reported it to the Fengtai Regional Party Committee and requested assistance in handling it. At that time, the Fengtai Regional Party Committee clearly saw that Xi Neng'an's arrogance and recklessness were not only because of the corrupt small group at play, but also because the erroneous thinking of individual deputy directors of the Beijing Railway Bureau and the director of the Locomotive Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, etc., who placed blind faith in Xi Neng'an instead of relying on the masses, was actually supporting him. Therefore, starting from 1950, the Fengtai Regional Party Committee criticized Xi Neng'an and his superior supporters on the one hand, and reported to the Beijing Railway Branch Party Committee to handle this issue on the other hand. However, the Branch Party Committee regarded Xi Neng'an's mistake as a problem between Xi Neng'an and Wang Rong, the secretary of the general branch. Based on this erroneous understanding, a compromise method of transferring Wang Rong away from the locomotive depot was adopted. Due to this erroneous measure, the democratic life within the Party was severely undermined, Xi Neng'an's mistakes were not corrected, and Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu's behavior of jointly fraudulently obtaining the title of meritorious worker was not exposed. Xi Neng'an's evil tendencies became increasingly rampant, and the phenomena of liberalism and disunity within the Party also became increasingly serious. What was particularly serious was that, as a result of Xi Neng'an's reliance on bad elements, a bad phenomenon of impure Party organization and lax discipline was created. Some Party members who lacked training in intra-Party struggle, seeing that Xi Neng'an had power and influence, dared not approach the Party organization and went to approach Xi Neng'an; some workers believed that the Party branch had no power and that "Xi Neng'an's words were indeed effective."
    Xi Neng'an's patriarchal leadership also seriously hindered the democratic reform and production of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot. Under his leadership, the production management structure of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot could not be thoroughly reformed for a long time, and the Production Management Committee and the Workers' Representative Assembly were merely formalities. Xi Neng'an favored his "own cultivated typical locomotives" and discriminated against and squeezed out other contracted locomotive groups, so that their production enthusiasm was greatly affected and they often failed to complete production tasks.
    The Tianjin Railway Bureau Party Committee, seeing that the leadership problem of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot was quite serious, had long criticized Xi Neng'an's mistakes. However, due to the inconsistency in the understanding of Xi Neng'an between the Tianjin Railway Bureau Party Committee, the director of the Locomotive Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, and the Beijing Railway Branch Party Committee, this issue was delayed for a period of time and was not resolved. After repeated consideration by the Tianjin Railway Bureau Party Committee, it was decided to dispatch a work team to improve the Party's work and solve the leadership problem of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot. After arriving in September last year, the work team participated in the general branch committee of the Party in the locomotive depot, conducted in-depth investigation and research, and looked for the key to the problem. After more than a month of work, it was found that the focus of various problems in the locomotive depot was that Xi Neng'an's leadership had serious errors. If Xi Neng'an's problem could not be solved, it would be difficult for the Party organization to play a fighting and leading role, the enthusiasm of the masses of workers would not be fully utilized, and improving production would become empty talk. Based on this understanding, the Party general branch decided to make the task of fully resolving Xi Neng'an's problem the central task of the first stage of rectifying the organization, completing the democratic reform of the locomotive depot, and preparing for production reform.
    At this time, Xi Neng'an and his gang still adopted double-dealing tactics towards the Party organization and the work team. They still believed in the ghost methods of deceiving superiors and falsely reporting achievements that they had used for many years, believing that these ghost methods were "very effective," and thinking that "this work team will just stay for a few days and then leave," and that "as long as everyone conceals it together, the work team will have no way to deal with it." Therefore, some people with insufficient willpower were still full of worries.
    In order to thoroughly correct Xi Neng'an's mistakes, the Party's general branch committee and the trade union organization first conducted extensive education on promoting democracy among Party members and the masses of workers, criticized Xi Neng'an's erroneous thinking of arrogance, complacency, and disregard for organization, helped Party members and the masses eliminate all worries, overcome liberalism, and boldly and responsibly conduct criticism and self-criticism, exposing Xi Neng'an's shortcomings and mistakes, and put forward suggestions for improvement. In addition, the work team solemnly stated that it would resolutely support the struggle of the masses, and that the matter must be thoroughly investigated, and even if it took several months, it would continue to investigate until the problem was completely resolved. The enthusiasm of the masses in criticizing the leadership style had been suppressed by Xi Neng'an for a long time, and once it received the correct support from the leadership, this enthusiasm was highly developed.
    Based on the spirit of "curing the disease to save the patient," and in accordance with the instructions of the superior Party committee, the Party general branch patiently conducted persuasion and education to Xi Neng'an, helping him to recognize his mistakes and striving for him to consciously correct his mistakes. For some Party member cadres who blindly echoed Xi Neng'an's erroneous thinking, they were helped to recognize right and wrong, correct their blindness, and educated to honestly examine the mistakes of participating in small groups, and consciously rely on the Party organization.
    Thanks to the strong support of the leadership, the consciousness of Party members and the masses was greatly improved. They raised many opinions on Xi Neng'an's mistakes. Some Party members wrote written reports of more than 10,000 words, exposing Xi Neng'an and some problems in the Party and government work. Party member cadres who had been wooed by Xi Neng'an in the past also gradually realized. In the past, they always thought, "I was promoted by Chief Xi, how dare I criticize him?" Now they realize that blindly following individuals without the leadership of the Party will inevitably make mistakes. They decided to break away from Xi Neng'an's circle, work hard, correct mistakes, and at the same time, actively fight against Xi Neng'an's erroneous thinking. As a result, Xi Neng'an's corrupt small group began to disintegrate, and Xi Neng'an's error of deviating from the leadership of the Party in production management could no longer be concealed. However, his and Li Yonglu's vile behavior of fraudulently obtaining the title of meritorious worker had not yet been publicly exposed. During the "Three-Anti" movement, the Party general branch further mobilized Party members and non-Party members, and the factory's Party members began to expose the facts of doing big and small "black work" for Li Yonglu's No. 1939 "model locomotive." At this time, the general branch committee found that the problem was even more serious and worked hard to mobilize the workers to continue to expose it. As a result, the workers said what had been suppressed in their hearts for a long time: "Li Yonglu's meritorious service is fake," "'No. 1939' model locomotive is not real," "They say 100,000 kilometers of safe driving, but I don't know how many accidents they have concealed," "They say they extended the Class A inspection to the outside world, but secretly the depot chief asked us to do black work for the 'No. 1939' locomotive".... The big secret that Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu had covered up for more than three years was exposed this time. At this time, the general branch also made careful checks and analyses based on the materials exposed by the masses, proving that Xi Neng'an, Li Yonglu, and others did have the behavior of fabricating achievements and fraudulently obtaining the title of meritorious worker.
    However, Xi Neng'an did not examine himself for such a serious incident, and still wanted to shirk responsibility.
    In order to educate Xi Neng'an again, the Party general branch decided to publicly announce the mistakes of Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu to the workers and staff members after a period of intra-Party ideological struggle, and called for the launch of a mass ideological struggle throughout the depot. Subsequently, more than 90 workers' and staff members' groups throughout the depot universally and practically discussed the mistakes of Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu. They also supplemented the exposure of many erroneous facts of Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu, criticized the thinking of Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu, believed that their thinking "is not the thinking of the working class" and "does not meet the conditions of a Communist Party member," and actively put forward opinions on how to deal with it.
    At this time, Xi Neng'an still wanted to shift his mistakes to others. He said that the reason why he made mistakes was because he "was surrounded by others" and "was fooled by others." He continued to use double-dealing tactics against the Party, admitting his mistakes in person, but secretly engaging in private small group activities behind his back, and still asking people with political problems to write false self-criticisms for him. At this point, the general branch committee and all Party members believed that Xi Neng'an was beyond redemption, and unanimously decided to expel him from the Party.
    After the decision to expel Xi Neng'an and others from the Party was announced, all the workers in the depot were very excited. They unanimously believed that "this is true democracy," and that "the democratic reform work that the Fengtai Locomotive Depot has not completed for a long time in the past three years has been basically completed after correctly solving the Xi Neng'an problem and after the 'Three-Anti' movement."
    The reason why Xi Neng'an's problem was able to be resolved correctly can be summarized as that the Party organization relied on the masses, conducted systematic investigation and research, and was thus able to find the main problems at that time from the complex and numerous phenomena, and grasp the main problems, promote democracy, actively support the masses, launch ideological struggle, and persist in this ideological struggle, and achieve victory.
    When intra-Party democracy was not promoted and ideological struggle was not launched in the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, the Party organization was controlled by Xi Neng'an and lacked fighting power. But after the ideological struggle was correctly carried out, the Party organization realized its leading role.
    The Xi Neng'an and Li Yonglu incident gave us many lessons. The most basic and important of these is that we must strengthen intra-Party democratic life and strengthen the Party's supervision and inspection of economic work. The reason why Xi Neng'an's mistakes developed to such a serious degree was first because the leadership of the superior Party lacked strict supervision and inspection of the work of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, and did not support the opinions from Party members and the masses of workers. In this way, Xi Neng'an became a special figure not subject to supervision from any party. Later, the leading comrades of the Beijing Railway Branch Party Committee, the Tianjin Regional Committee of the Railway Trade Union, and the Locomotive Department of the Tianjin Railway Bureau inspected the work of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot several times, and some of them even stayed there for three or four months. Some of them criticized Xi Neng'an with "sharp words," but because this top-down inspection and criticism lacked a mass base, they did not find serious problems, and of course, they did not solve the Xi Neng'an problem early. From this, it should be concluded that in order to truly cherish cadres, improve leadership, and improve work, the leading comrades of the superior Party should go to the masses to listen to the opinions of the masses, mobilize the masses to review cadres, and assess cadres, and combine top-down inspection with bottom-up inspection, and combine leadership supervision with mass supervision, in order to understand the truth of things and fully understand cadres. Otherwise, if the masses are not taken seriously, and problems are handled with a mindset of eagerness for success, or even an attitude of accommodating and condoning cadres' mistakes, such leaders, even if they move from leading organs to lower levels, are only moving their positions and cannot solve any problems. The basic key to why the Beijing Railway Branch Party Committee failed to solve the Xi Neng'an problem in the Fengtai Locomotive Depot for a long time lies here.
    In the year or so after liberation, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot was once a relatively advanced locomotive depot due to the effective promotion of advanced Soviet railway experience by the workers and staff; but since 1951, due to Xi Neng'an's erroneous leadership, the production of the entire depot has fallen into a backward state. The correct solution of the Xi Neng'an problem this time has purified the Party organization, improved the consciousness of Party members and the masses, and laid the foundation for future production reform. Now, a study movement is being carried out throughout the depot, and criticism and self-criticism have been launched among Party members and non-Party members to eliminate all false reports, so that everyone can treat the various undertakings of the Party and the state with a loyal attitude. After the movement was launched, the bad habits of making false reports and concealing accidents left over from the old railway, which had not been eliminated since liberation, have been criticized by the masses, the phenomenon of making false statistics and falsely reporting achievements has been basically eliminated, and new records of 500 kilometers of full-load and over-axis movement have continued to appear, and the production indicators of the entire depot are steadily rising. For example, the daily car kilometers of freight locomotives in the entire depot were only 341.5 kilometers in May this year, but reached 413.9 kilometers in July, an increase of 21.2 percent.
    After solving the Xi Neng'an problem and basically completing the democratic reform, production reform has become the central task of the current stage of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot. However, the production problems of the entire depot are also serious, and it is still necessary to solve them carefully and patiently. For a locomotive depot that has suffered serious setbacks, being impatient will be detrimental. In order to consolidate the achievements of the previous stage of the movement, and to implement production reform, promote advanced production experience, rectify and implement the economic accounting system on the basis of democratic reform, the Party organization of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot must vigorously mobilize the masses, give play to the creativity of the masses, and give play to the fighting power of the Party, so that production reform and the competition movement can move forward steadily under the leadership of the Party and the supervision of the masses.

    丰台机务段党组织坚持领导了对奚能安的思想斗争
    陈春森
    北京铁路分局丰台机务段党的基层组织对于前丰台机务段段长奚能安在生产管理中脱离党的领导的错误思想，及其和李永禄共同假报成绩、骗取功臣称号的可耻行为，曾进行了一系列的严肃斗争。
    早在一九五○年李永禄到天津铁路管理局和铁道部去“表功”时，工人们就暗地议论：“什么功臣模范！还不是段长叫谁当模范，谁就成了模范！”这种批评是有道理的，可惜当时没有引起党支部和领导方面的重视。一九五○年九月干部整风期间，党员和工人群众曾给奚能安等领导人提出四百多条意见，也没有引起领导方面的注意。从这个时候起，奚能安对党的总支和支部采取了恶意报复、打击的态度。他有意识地拉拢一些人，形成一种势力，控制着党、政、工会的领导，独断专行，歪曲党的原则，无中生有地硬说总支副书记郭福顺“包办行政”，并责备总支书记王荣不该发动群众提意见。
    党总支看到奚能安的问题已经相当复杂，就报告了丰台地区党委，请求帮助处理。当时，丰台地区党委清楚地看到：奚能安所以如此傲横、狂妄，不仅因为有着腐朽的小集团在作怪，而且还因为北京铁路分局个别副局长和铁道部机务局局长等人的偏信奚能安而不依靠群众的错误思想实际上在支持着他。于是从一九五○年起，丰台地区党委会一面对奚能安及其上级支持者进行了批评；一面报请北京铁路分党委处理这一问题。而分党委却把奚能安的错误当成奚能安和总支书记王荣之间的关系问题。根据这一错误的认识，就采取了把王荣调离机务段这样一种妥协的办法。由于这一错误的措施，就使党内民主生活受到了严重的摧残，使奚能安的错误没有得到纠正，而奚能安和李永禄共同骗取功臣称号的行为也没有被揭发出来，奚能安的邪气也就愈益嚣张，党内的自由主义和不团结现象也因而日趋严重。特别严重的是由于奚能安依靠坏分子的结果，曾经造成党内组织不纯、纪律松弛的恶劣现象。某些缺乏党内斗争锻炼的党员，看到奚能安有权有势，竟不敢靠近党的组织，而去靠拢奚能安；某些工人则认为党支部没有力量，“确是奚能安说话顶事”。
    奚能安家长式的领导，也严重地妨碍了丰台机务段的民主改革和生产。在他的领导下，丰台机务段的生产管理机构长期得不到彻底改造，生产管理委员会、职工代表会徒具形式。奚能安偏袒他“自己培养的典型机车”，歧视和排挤别的包车组，以致使他们的生产情绪受到很大的影响，常常不能完成生产任务。
    天津铁路局党委会看到丰台机务段的领导问题相当严重，早就批评过奚能安的错误。但由于天津铁路局党委和铁道部机务局长及北京铁路分党委之间，对奚能安的认识不一致，曾使这个问题拖延了一个时期，未得到解决。后经天津铁路局党委反覆考虑，才决定派遣工作组去，以改进党的工作，解决丰台机务段的领导问题。工作组于去年九月到达后，参加了机务段党的总支委员会，深入调查研究，找寻问题的关键。经过一个多月的工作，发现机务段各种问题的焦点是奚能安的领导有着严重的错误。如果奚能安的问题解决不了，党的组织就很难发挥战斗的作用和领导的作用，工人群众的积极性就不会充分发挥出来，改进生产也会成为空话。根据这一认识，党总支决定把全力解决奚能安问题作为整顿机构、完成机务段民主改革、准备生产改革的第一阶段的中心任务。
    这时奚能安一伙人仍然对党的组织和工作组采取两面手段。他们还迷信于他们长年使用的欺瞒上级、虚报成绩的鬼办法，认为这些鬼办法“很有效”，认为“这个工作组来住些日子也就过去了”，“只要大家一齐隐瞒，工作组也没办法”。因此，某些意志不够坚强的人仍然是顾虑重重。
    为了彻底纠正奚能安的错误，党的总支委员会和工会组织，首先在党员和工人群众中广泛地进行了关于发扬民主的教育，批判了奚能安骄傲自满、目无组织的错误思想，帮助党员群众打消一切顾虑，克服自由主义，大胆地负责地进行批评和自我批评，揭露奚能安的缺点和错误，提出改进意见。此外，工作组并郑重表示，坚决支持群众的斗争，事情一定要弄个水落石出，那怕需要几个月的时间，也要追查下去，使问题得到彻底解决。群众在批评领导作风方面的积极性，长期遭到奚能安的压抑，一旦得到领导方面的正确支持，这种积极性便高度地发扬起来。
    党的总支本着“治病救人”的精神，按照上级党委的指示，对奚能安耐心地进行了说服教育，帮助他认识错误，争取他自觉地改正错误。对于盲目附和奚能安的错误思想的某些党员干部，则帮助他们认清是非，纠正其盲目性，并教育他们老老实实地检讨参加小集团的错误，自觉地依靠党的组织。
    由于领导方面的大力支持，党员群众的觉悟大大提高，他们对奚能安的错误提了许多意见，有的党员写了一万多字的书面报告，揭露奚能安以及党、政工作上的一些问题。过去被奚能安拉拢的党员干部，也逐渐觉悟了。他们过去总认为“我是奚段长一手提拔起来的，那敢批评他”；现在认识到脱离党的领导而盲从个人一定要犯错误。他们决定脱离奚能安的圈套，努力工作，改正错误；同时，积极向奚能安的错误思想作斗争。于是，奚能安的腐朽的小集团开始瓦解了，奚能安在生产管理中脱离党的领导的错误，再也无法掩盖了。但是，他和李永禄骗取功臣称号的恶劣行为还没有被公开揭发出来。在“三反”运动中，党总支又进一步发动了党内外群众，工厂的党员便开始揭发为李永禄他们的一九三九号“模范机车”做大小“黑活”的事实。这时，总支委员会发现问题更加严重，努力发动工人继续揭露。于是工人们纷纷说出长时期闷在肚子里的话：“李永禄这个功臣是假的”，“‘一九三九号’模范机车可不是真的”，“说是十万安全公里，那不知隐瞒了多少事故”，“对外说延长甲检，背地里段长却叫我们给‘一九三九号’机车做黑活”……。奚能安和李永禄掩盖了三年多的大黑幕，这一下就被揭开了。这时，总支又根据群众揭露的材料，作了仔细的查对、分析，证明奚能安、李永禄等确有伪造成绩、骗取功臣称号的行为。
    但是，对于这样严重的事件，奚能安还不检讨，还想推脱。
    党总支为了再次教育奚能安，在进行了一个时期的党内思想斗争之后，决定把奚能安、李永禄的错误公开向职工群众宣布，号召展开全段的群众性的思想斗争。接着，全段九十多个工人职员小组普遍切实地讨论了奚能安、李永禄的错误，他们并补充揭露了奚能安、李永禄的许多错误事实，批判了奚能安李永禄的思想，认为他们的思想“不是工人阶级的思想”，“不合共产党员的条件”，并积极提出处理的意见。
    这时，奚能安仍然想把自己的错误转嫁到别人身上。他说他所以犯错误，是因为“受了别人的包围”，是“上了别人的当”。他继续对党耍两面手段，当面承认错误，背地则仍然秘密地搞私人小集团活动，仍然叫有政治问题的人替他写假检讨。至此，总支委员会和全体党员认为奚能安已不可救药，一致决定把他清除出党。
    奚能安等清除出党的决定宣布以后，全段工人十分兴奋。一致认为“这就是真正的民主”，“丰台机务段三年来长期没有完成的民主改革工作，在正确地解决了奚能安问题以后，在‘三反’运动以后，已经基本上完成了。”
    奚能安的问题所以能够获得正确的解决，概括地说，是因为党组织依靠群众，进行了系统的调查研究，因而能够从复杂纷繁的现象中找出当时的主要问题，并抓住主要问题，发扬民主，积极地支持群众，展开了思想斗争，并把这种思想斗争坚持下去，取得了胜利。
    在丰台机务段党内民主没有发扬、思想斗争没有展开的时候，党的组织受着奚能安的控制，缺乏战斗力量。但在正确地开展了思想斗争之后，党的组织就实现了自己的领导作用。
    奚能安、李永禄事件给予我们的教训是很多的。其中最基本最重要的一条，就是必须加强党内的民主生活，加强党对经济工作的监督和检查。奚能安的错误所以发展到这样严重的地步，首先由于上级党的领导方面对丰台机务段工作缺乏严格的监督和检查，而对来自党员群众和工人群众的意见又不予以支持。这样，奚能安就变成了不受任何方面监督的特殊人物。后来，北京铁路分党委、铁路工会天津区委会和天津铁路局机务处的领导同志虽然到丰台机务段检查过几次工作，有的还住在那里工作了三、四个月之久，有的对奚能安批评得也真是“言词激厉”，只因这种自上而下的检查和批评失去了群众基础，就没有发现严重问题，当然，更没有及早解决奚能安问题。由此，应该得出结论：为了真正地爱护干部，改善领导，改进工作，上级党的领导同志应该到群众中去听取群众的意见，发动群众来审查干部，考核干部，把自上而下的检查和自下而上的检查结合起来，把领导监督和群众监督结合起来，才能认识事物的真相，才能全面地认识干部。否则，如果不把群众放在眼里，带着好大喜功的思想去处理问题，甚至对干部的错误抱迁就姑息的态度，这样的领导者即使从领导机关到了下层，也只是位置的转移，也不可能解决什么问题。北京铁路分局党委所以长期未能解决丰台机务段奚能安的问题，其基本关键就在这里。
    丰台机务段在解放后的一年多内，由于职工群众带头推行苏联铁路先进经验有成效，曾经是一个比较先进的机务段；但从一九五一年以后，由于奚能安的错误领导，全段生产便陷入落后状态。这次奚能安问题的正确解决，纯洁了党的组织，提高了党员和群众的觉悟，为今后生产改革打下了基础。现在全段正在开展一个学习运动，在党内和党外群众中展开了批评和自我批评，以消灭一切假报告，使大家用忠诚的态度对待党和国家的各项事业。运动展开以后，旧铁路遗留的、解放后一直未被清除的做假报告、隐瞒事故的坏习气，已受到了群众性的批评，作假统计和假报成绩的现象已基本消灭，全段满载超轴五百公里运动的新纪录也继续出现，全段生产指标正步步上升。如全段货物机车日车公里今年五月份只三百四十一·五公里，七月份达到了四百一十三·九公里，提高了百分之二十一·二。
    在解决了奚能安问题和基本完成民主改革之后，生产改革已成为丰台机务段现阶段的中心任务。但全段的生产问题也是严重的，还必须继续细致地、耐心地加以解决。对于这样一个遭受过严重挫折的机务段，急于求成将会不利。为了巩固前一阶段运动的成果，并在民主改革的基础上，实行生产改革，推行先进生产经验，整顿和贯彻经济核算制，丰台机务段党的组织还须大力发动群众，发挥群众的创造性，发挥党的战斗力量，使生产改革和竞赛运动在党的领导和群众的监督下稳步前进。
