    Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Trade Union Begins to Emphasize Workers' Sports Activities

    Editor: The criticism made by reader Qin Gang in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on July 28th regarding our lack of emphasis on workers' sports activities is entirely correct. We have made a preliminary examination and believe that although we established a sports preparatory committee in the past, we did not actually do any sports work. Last August, the construction of the bureau's building required a woodworking workplace and a place to store equipment, so the playing field was occupied. When comrades raised criticisms, we studied them and thought they were right, but we did not actively think of ways to solve the problem. Everyone asked to borrow a playing field nearby, but we subjectively thought that people would definitely not lend it, so we did not contact them. Last August, we planned to establish a telecommunications bureau representative team, but it has not been established yet, and the sportswear purchased at that time has not been used. In May of this year, the workers organized a basketball team to compete with outside teams. At that time, they asked us to borrow sportswear, but we mechanically thought that this was issued to the representative team, so we did not lend it to them. This is not right. This proves that we did not study and solve problems when we encountered them, and we treated the legitimate demands of the masses with a bureaucratic attitude. Now, we know that this is wrong, and we have organized a team to investigate the sports equipment of each unit. We are also preparing to reorganize the sports preparatory committee. Regarding the playing field problem, a preliminary reasonable solution has been reached. In the future, we will definitely improve sports work gradually based on the actual situation and opinions of each unit.

专栏：对人民日报读者  批评建议的反应

    北京电信局工会开始重视工人体育活动
    编辑同志：七月二十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载读者琴岗对我们不重视工人体育活动的批评，这个批评是完全正确的。我们初步作了检查，认为我们过去虽然建立了体育筹备委员会，但对体育工作，实际上并没有作。去年八月，本局盖房需要木工工作场地和存放器材的地方，就占用了球场。同志们提出批评，我们研究了一下，认为是对的，但没有积极地想办法来解决问题。大家要求在附近借球场，我们便主观地认为人家一定不借，就不去联系。去年八月，我们准备成立电信局代表球队，直到现在还没有成立，当时所买的运动衣，也存着没有使用。今年五月，工人们组织篮球队要和外面球队比赛，当时他们向我们借运动衣，我们机械地认为这是发给代表队的，就没借给他们。这是不对的。这证明我们遇到问题没去研究解决，用官僚主义的态度来对待群众的正当要求。现在，我们知道这样作是不对的，我们已组织了一个小组，调查各单位体育活动的设备，我们还准备改组体育筹备委员会。关于球场问题，已得到初步合理的解决。以后我们一定根据各单位的实际情况和意见，逐步改进体育工作。
