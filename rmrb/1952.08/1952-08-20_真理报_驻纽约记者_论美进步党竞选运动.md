    Xinhua News Agency, August 19th (Moscow dispatch by TASS): "Pravda" correspondent in New York, Litoshenko, commented on the results of the US Progressive Party's national convention held in Chicago in early July, saying that the Progressive Party unites democratically-minded Americans who are seeking a way out of the vicious cycle of Wall Street's aggressive two-party system. The American working people are realizing more and more clearly that neither of the two parties of American monopoly capital, whether Republican or Democrat, intends to realize the American people's desire for peace. The entire course of events has taught millions of Americans to distinguish the true meaning of the hypocritical promises of these two Wall Street parties, and they call the Republican and Democratic parties "parties of broken promises."

    Litoshenko recalled that the American Progressive Party has appeared on the American social stage as a fighter for peace for four years. It protested against the intervention of American imperialists in Korea, demanded an immediate end to this action, and condemned all other aggressive measures of the Washington ruling group.

    Litoshenko wrote that the Progressive Party's election platform is in line with the interests of the vast majority of American working people who desire peace, work, and democracy. Its presidential candidate, Hallinan, and vice-presidential candidate, Mrs. Bass, are known as loyal fighters for peace and freedom.

    Litoshenko continued, the American ruling group is doing everything possible to suppress the voice of the Progressive Party. Radio and television stations are closed to the Progressive Party. Wherever people begin to show concern for the Progressive Party, the bourgeois newspapers immediately use the vicious weapons of rumor and slander to defame it.

    American progressive forces must conduct their election campaign in the face of increasing police terror. Fascist organizations such as the "American Legion" and the "Veterans of Foreign Wars Association," under the open protection of the authorities, disrupt the Progressive Party's election meetings. For example, lawless thugs prevented the Progressive Party from holding an election meeting in Gary, the center of the large steel industry. Nevertheless, the Progressive Party overcame numerous obstacles and launched its campaign.

    Litoshenko concluded by saying that regardless of the outcome of the November elections, the Progressive Party's active participation in this election will strengthen the unity of forces fighting for peace and against the aggressive policies of the Wall Street rulers.

    论美进步党竞选运动
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”驻纽约记者李托希科就美国进步党七月初在芝加哥举行的全国代表大会的结果评论说，进步党团结着有民主思想的美国人，他们寻找着出路，以摆脱华尔街侵略性的两党制度的恶性循环。美国劳动人民一天比一天更清楚地认识到：美国垄断资本的两个政党，不论是共和党还是民主党，都没有打算实现美国人民的和平愿望。事态的整个发展过程使美国千百万人学会了分辨这两个华尔街政党的虚伪诺言的真实意义，他们把共和党和民主党叫做“食言的党”。
    李托希科追述道：美国进步党成立四年以来以和平战士的姿态出现在美国的社会舞台。它抗议美国帝国主义者干涉朝鲜，要求立即停止这种行动，并谴责华盛顿统治集团其他一切的侵略措施。
    李托希科写道：进步党的竞选纲领是符合希望和平、工作与民主的美国绝大多数劳动者的利益的。它的总统候选人哈利南和副总统候选人巴斯夫人是以忠实的和平与自由的战士出名的。
    李托希科继续写道，美国统治集团竭尽全力来压制进步党的声音。电台和电视广播台都向进步党关门。凡是人们开始对进步党表示关怀的地方，资产阶级报纸便连忙使用造谣和诽谤的恶毒武器来进行中伤。
    美国进步力量必须在警察恐怖加剧的情况下进行竞选。“美国退伍军人团”和“国外战争退伍军人协会”之类的法西斯组织在当局公开的庇护下，捣乱进步党的竞选会议。例如，无法无天的流氓匪徒不让进步党在大钢铁工业中心格利城举行竞选会议。但是，尽管如此，进步党仍然克服了重重的阻碍，展开了它的竞选活动。
    李托希科最后说，不管十一月份选举的结果怎样，进步党积极参加这次竞选，必将加强为争取和平，反对华尔街统治者的侵略政策而斗争的力量的团结。
