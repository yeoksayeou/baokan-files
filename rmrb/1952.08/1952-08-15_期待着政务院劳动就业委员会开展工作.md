    Looking forward to the State Council Labor Employment Committee to carry out its work
    Editor: After the newspaper published the "Decision on Labor Employment Issues" of the State Council of the Central People's Government, the People's Daily editorial "Implementing Comprehensive Labor Employment in a Planned and Step-by-Step Manner" and the "List of the State Council Labor Employment Committee," we were truly excited. We looked at it again and again, read it again and again, which made us moved to tears. When we told our relatives and friends, they were as excited as we were. They all said: This is another miracle and an unprecedented great happy event in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. This unprecedented joy not only vibrates the heartstrings of many unemployed middle-aged and older people, but also reduces the burden and concerns of many young people in employment on their families. We are happy that we will have the opportunity for unprecedented universal employment. From now on, "housewives" and "age unqualified" are no longer obstacles for us to participate in the construction of the motherland. In addition to intensifying our studies, we are also eagerly looking forward to the State Council Labor Employment Committee to carry out its work. Because, as the People's Daily editorial said: "This is a new task, a very arduous and meticulous task, we must carry it out with a high sense of responsibility and a serious and conscientious attitude. ... In particular, it is necessary to fight against those departmentalism that disregards the overall situation, negative resistance and simple relief ideas, in order to implement the State Council's decision on labor employment issues."

    期待着政务院劳动就业委员会开展工作
    编辑同志：报纸上发表了中央人民政府政务院“关于劳动就业问题的决定”，人民日报社论“有计划有步骤地实现全面的劳动就业”和“政务院劳动就业委员会的名单”以后，我们真是太兴奋了。我们看了又看，读了又读，使我们激动得热泪欲流，我们走告亲戚朋友时，她们都和我们一样的兴奋。她们都说：这是共产党、毛主席领导下的新中国的又一奇迹，又一空前大喜事。这种空前的喜悦，不独震荡着许许多多中年以上失业者的心弦，同时也减少了多少青年在职者对家庭的负担和顾虑。我们欢喜的是：我们将得到空前未有的普遍就业的机会。从今而后，“家庭妇女”、“年龄不合格”等，已不再是我们参加祖国建设事业的障碍了。我们除了加紧学习外，更以迫切的心情期待着政务院劳动就业委员会开展工作。因为正如人民日报的社论所说：“这是一件新的工作，是十分繁重的细致的工作，我们必须以高度的负责精神和严肃认真的态度去进行。……特别是要向那些不顾全局的本位主义思想、消极抗拒和单纯救济的思想作斗争，才能贯彻执行政务院关于劳动就业问题的决定。”家庭妇女  沈子成  李锦等
