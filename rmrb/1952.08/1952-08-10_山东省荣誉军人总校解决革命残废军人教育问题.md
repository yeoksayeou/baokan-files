    Shandong Province Honors Military Personnel General School Solves Education Problems for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers

    Editor: The situation reflected in the letter "Concern for the Health and Education of Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers" published in the People's Daily's Reader's Letters column on July 17th is accurate. When Shandong Province's First Honors Military Personnel Middle School moved from the countryside to Jinan City in January of this year, it only had one building (about sixty rooms). Later, some more houses were built, but they were still not enough. Later, due to the start of the "Three-Anti" movement, the school's construction project was suspended. The school buildings were already insufficient, and this spring a new batch of students was received, making the housing even more inadequate. There is no auditorium or dining hall at all. The General School has studied these situations several times, and has now requested and been approved by higher authorities to build some dormitories; as for the dining hall, courtyard walls, sports grounds, etc., designs have also been made and budgets created, and construction can begin after approval by higher authorities. In the past, our education of revolutionary disabled soldiers was carried out in isolation, and the connection with relevant departments was very poor, so problems such as selecting teaching materials and hiring teachers were not solved in a timely and comprehensive manner. After the East China Military and Political Committee instructed the establishment of a "Honors School Working Committee" in June 1952, it has been established in this province and has already begun to work. In the future, the committee will specifically implement and solve the educational policies and some major issues for revolutionary disabled soldiers according to the instructions of higher authorities.

### 山东省荣誉军人总校解决革命残废军人教育问题

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    山东省荣誉军人总校解决革命残废军人教育问题
    编辑同志：七月十七日人民日报读者来信栏刊载的“关心革命残废军人的健康和教育”一信所反映的情况是确实的。山东省第一荣誉军人中学在今年一月由农村移到济南市时，只有一座楼房（约六十余间）。以后又修建了一部分房舍，但仍不足用。后因“三反”运动开始，学校的修建工程停顿下来。本来校舍就不够用，今春又接收了一批新学员，房子就更不够用了。礼堂、饭厅根本就没有。总校对这些情况曾研究过数次，现在已经请示上级批准修建了一些宿舍；至于饭厅、院墙、运动场等也经过设计，造了预算，等到上级批准后即可动工修建。我们对革命残废军人的教育，过去是孤立进行的，和有关部门联系很差，因而对选定教材、聘请教员等问题，没有及时地全部地加以解决。一九五二年六月华东军政委员会指示成立“荣校工作委员会”以后，本省已经成立，并已开始办公。该会今后对革命残废军人的教育方针和一些重大问题，将根据上级指示具体贯彻和解决。
