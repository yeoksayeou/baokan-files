The West German People's Movement Against the "General Treaty" is Growing

[Report from our newspaper] Integrated news: Since the West German Federal Assembly passed the "General Treaty" on first reading on July 10, the West German people's protest movement against the "General Treaty" has been expanding. As of August 7, more than 8 million people in West Germany have expressed their opposition to the Bonn revanchists' anti-national policies, opposition to the separate "General Treaty," and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty with a unified Germany in a public opinion poll.

Now people from all walks of life in West Germany, including people with different political views and religious beliefs, have joined the struggle against the "General Treaty."

The "Workers' Group for Mutual Understanding Among the German People" recently held a meeting in Stuttgart, advocating continuous struggle against the military "General Treaty." The Baden-Baden-Württemberg "Workers' Committee Against Remilitarization and for a Peace Treaty" and the Hesse "Workers' Committee for Promoting Mutual Understanding Among the German People and for Striving for a Just Peace Treaty" have issued declarations calling on the people of the two states to continue to fight against Adenauer's military treaty.

Representatives of various youth groups in West Germany met in Bremen, firmly protesting against remilitarization and demanding immediate Four Power negotiations on the German peace treaty issue. Seventy-eight Catholic youth leaders in West Germany established the "Catholic Youth Group Against Rearmament Policy" in Essen to organize the struggle against Adenauer's war plan. They issued a declaration pointing out that it is necessary to stop the ratification of the "General Treaty" and the re-implementation of militarism.

Some civilian industrialists in West Germany have also begun to openly express their opposition to the "General Treaty." The Bavarian Chamber of Industry and Commerce recently held a meeting in Coburg, expressing opposition to the "General Treaty" and the "European Army Treaty."

The "West German Central Committee of the Association of Victims of Nazism," which includes representatives from all walks of life, issued a communiqué on the association's conference in Frankfurt. The communiqué stated: Determined to use all means to strengthen the struggle for German unification and against the military "General Treaty." A conference was recently held in Nuremberg, attended by members of various political parties and men and women with various beliefs. The former Mayor and Police Chief of Munich-Glockenbach, Christian Democratic Union member Elfer, shouted at the conference: "Down with the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty!" The masses participating in the conference held up long banners with the words: "Those who are in favor of the General Treaty are not Germans!" "Strive for freedom through a peace treaty!" The conference unanimously passed a resolution urging the Bonn parliament to refuse to ratify the military "General Treaty." The "West German Association for the Defense of Democratic Rights" recently called for uniting all forces to fight against Adenauer's war policy and against depriving the people of their basic civil rights.

In order to facilitate the implementation of the general war treaty, the West German reactionary parties manipulated the parliament on July 19 to pass the anti-labor "Factory Law" on the third reading. The purpose of this "Factory Law" is to deprive workers of their main democratic rights in order to step up large-scale military expansion and war preparations in West Germany. The passage of this reactionary bill has been strongly opposed by West German workers. As of July 27, more than 500,000 workers have passed resolutions expressing their firm rejection of this "Factory Law." 300,000 miners in the Ruhr, 65,000 metalworkers in Stuttgart, 20,000 workers in Munich, 10,000 workers in Nuremberg, and many other workers in other places have passed resolutions protesting the passage of the "Factory Law."

At present, the West German workers' struggle against the "Factory Law" has been closely integrated with the powerful West German movement against the "General Treaty" and striving for an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

    西德人民反对“一般性条约”运动日益壮大
    【本报讯】综合消息：自从西德联邦议会在七月十日一读通过“一般性条约”后，西德人民反对“一般性条约”的抗议运动已日益扩大。到八月七日为止，西德已有八百多万人在民意投票中表示反对波恩复仇主义者的反民族政策，反对单独的“一般性条约”，要求与统一的德国缔结和约。
    现在西德各阶层人民，包括政治见解和宗教信仰各不相同的人们都纷纷加入了反对“一般性条约”的斗争行列。
    “工人争取德国人民互相了解团”最近在斯图加特举行会议，主张对军事性的“一般性条约”进行不断的斗争。巴登—巴登堡州“工人反对重新军国主义化争取缔结和约委员会”和黑森州“工人促进德国人民相互了解与争取缔结公正和约委员会”都发表宣言，号召该两州人民继续为反对阿登纳的军事条约而斗争。
    西德各种青年团体代表们在不来梅开会，坚决抗议重新军国主义化，要求就对德和约问题立刻举行四大国谈判。西德七十八位天主教青年领袖为了组织反对阿登纳战争计划的斗争，在埃森成立了“天主教青年反对重新武装政策团体”。他们发表宣言，指出必须制止批准“一般性条约”和重新实行军国主义。
    西德某些民用工业资本家也开始公开表示反对“一般性条约”。巴伐利亚州工商联合会最近在科登堡举行会议，表示反对“一般性条约”和“欧洲军条约”。
    包括各阶层代表的“纳粹主义受害者协会西德中央委员会”就该协会在法兰克福举行的大会发表公报，公报表示：决心用一切办法，加强争取德国统一、反对军事性的“一般性条约”的斗争。纽伦堡最近举行了各政党党员以及有着各种不同信仰的男女们参加的大会。前慕尼黑—格拉巴什市长兼警察局长、基督教民主党党员艾尔费尔在大会上高呼：“打倒巴黎条约和波恩条约！”参加大会的群众高举起长旗，上面写着：“赞成一般性条约的不是德国人！”“通过和约争取自由！”大会最后一致通过决议，敦促波恩议会拒绝批准军事性的“一般性条约”。“西德保卫民主权利斗争协会”最近曾号召团结一切力量为反对阿登纳的战争政策，反对剥夺人民的基本公民权利而斗争。
    西德各反动政党为了便于一般性战争条约的实施，更于七月十九日操纵议会三读通过了反劳工的
    “工厂法”。这个“工厂法”的目的在于剥夺工人的主要民主权利，以便在西德加紧大规模扩军备战。这一反动法案的通过，遭到西德工人强烈的反对。到七月二十七日为止，已有五十多万工人纷纷通过决议，表示坚决拒绝这个“工厂法”。鲁尔有三十万矿工，斯图加特有六万五金工人，慕尼黑有两万工人，纽伦堡有一万工人以及其他各地许多工人，都通过决议，抗议通过“工厂法”。
    目前，西德工人反对“工厂法”的斗争，已经和西德反对“一般性条约”及争取尽早缔结对德和约的强大运动紧密地结合在一起了。
