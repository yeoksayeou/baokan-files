    Today, the second year of the Huai River harnessing project has successfully concluded. As the fundamental project to control the Huai River is about to enter its third year, the people along the Huai River are excited and sincerely grateful to the Soviet experts for their great contribution to the Huai River harnessing project. The help of Soviet advanced experience has forged an unforgettable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union in peaceful construction.
    The greatest help that Soviet experts have provided to the Huai River harnessing project is to point out the direction of scientific and technological progress in water conservancy construction for the Chinese people. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the idea of "channeling the Huai River" was also proposed, and a huge plan for channeling the Huai River was formulated with the help of American experts. However, after decades of discussion on how to effectively harness the Huai River, no conclusion was reached. Their common focus and the basic content of all plans was to view water as a disaster and to simply dispose of it into the sea. But what is the fundamental principle of the new China in governing the Huai River today? Soviet expert Bukov told us: "In the Soviet Union, water is considered the wealth of the people." According to Chairman Mao's instruction to "transform the water disaster of the Huai River into water conservancy," Bukov first studied the historical hydrological conditions of the Huai River, and then personally went to the Huai River basin for inspection. He broke the old rules of seeking self-interest and governing in segments, and began to carry out a fundamental plan for the entire Huai River basin, helping us to determine the large-scale construction of reservoir projects in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River and lake storage projects, and the opening of general irrigation canals in the lower reaches and the diversion of the Huai River's main and tributary streams below Wuhe County in northern Anhui, requiring the interception and storage of 20 billion cubic meters of floodwater. This has transformed the Huai River harnessing project from a temporary one to a permanent one, and from passive harm reduction to active benefit creation. The benefits of the Huai River harnessing project in the past two years have fully proved that the central government's policy on harnessing the Huai River and the direction of water conservancy development proposed by Soviet experts are completely correct.
    In the various specific design works of the Huai River harnessing project, Bukov unreservedly passed on the advanced Soviet technology to the Chinese people. This not only directly helped and accelerated the progress of the Huai River harnessing project, but more importantly, promoted a major reform of Chinese technical thinking. When planning the flood storage project above Zhengyangguan in northern Anhui, according to old technical viewpoints, it was once planned to first build temporary grass dams to achieve partial control of floods, because to completely control floods, a series of sluices and dams had to be built, and such a large project was considered impossible to complete in the short term. Bukov personally inspected the terrain above Zhengyangguan, and after scientific and precise analysis, he believed that it was entirely possible to build a fully controlled flood storage project. He also introduced the advanced Soviet experience of not using foundation piles and sheet piles based on our existing technical capabilities and conditions, and helped design and encouraged the Chinese people to manufacture hydraulically operated gate valves themselves, solving many difficult problems, and finally successfully completing the Runheji diversion gate in more than three months. Following the successful completion of the Runheji diversion gate, huge projects such as the Gaoliangjian water intake gate of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal and the control gate on the Dongfei River were completed in a short period of time in the second year of the project.
    The characteristics of the application of Soviet advanced experience in the Huai River harnessing project are: economical, time-saving, and safe. For example, in the five sluice projects designed in the Subei area, the adoption of Soviet advanced experience saved the country 15 billion yuan of wealth. However, the promotion of Soviet advanced experience was not entirely smooth, and the conservative thinking of many technicians hindered their progress. For example, when Bukov suggested using impermeable clay layers instead of sheet piles, some technicians had various doubts and concerns: Impermeable clay layers are useful, but we have no experience with them, can they really be impermeable? For the joint between the impermeable clay layer and the concrete, is the asphalt felt lining the burlap bags likely to crack due to vibration? In order to promote Soviet advanced experience, the project command conducted planned education for cadres using successful Soviet examples, and conducted multiple tests before construction, proving that Soviet advanced experience was completely correct, which eliminated the doubts of many people.
    During the construction period of the Huai River harnessing project, Soviet experts did not spare any effort to visit the site and provide various assistance. In April of this year, Minister of Water Conservancy Fu Zuoyi, together with Soviet experts Bukov and Shabayev, inspected the three reservoirs built in the upper reaches of the Huai River and put forward many important suggestions. For example, the slope of the water-facing slope of the Baisha Reservoir earth dam was originally one to three. Since the gate valves could not be installed this summer, the slope might collapse if the water level dropped sharply. Therefore, it was suggested to modify the slope and add buttresses. It was also suggested to add a tens of meters of anti-leakage layer at the bottom of the dam in front of the reservoir, so that the reservoir would be safer.
    The spirit of wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people and the meticulous and serious working style of the Soviet experts moved every Huai River harnessing worker and expressed infinite admiration. During the construction period, Bukov had a relapse of his eye disease three or four times due to overwork. The doctor advised him to seek timely treatment, but he still insisted on working despite his illness. Often, a problem could not be solved, and he could not sleep all night. When conducting engineering design and hydrological calculations, Bukov calculated at the same time as the Chinese technicians, and then cross-checked the results. When inspecting the reservoir project in the upper reaches of the Huai River this year, Bukov and Shabayev did not spare any effort to climb mountains and wade through water, sometimes even in the rain, helping to push cars, often working day and night, fully demonstrating the noble spirit of internationalism.
    In the Huai River harnessing project, the superiority of Soviet advanced experience and the working methods of Soviet experts have greatly educated many engineering personnel. An experienced engineer said: "In the past, when we built sluices, we never used piles, regardless of the soil quality. The Runheji diversion sluice project without any foundation piles is truly a great revolution in sluice construction." Another engineer said with emotion: "Soviet advanced experience has broken our outdated engineering views and strengthened our confidence in relying on ourselves, which will undoubtedly play a significant role in China's future water conservancy construction work."

    苏联先进经验和治淮
    新华社记者  茀君、人怡
    今天，治淮第二年度工程胜利结束了。当根治淮河工程即将进入第三个年头的时候，淮河沿岸的人民，都怀着兴奋的心情，衷心地感激苏联专家对治淮工程的巨大贡献。苏联先进经验的帮助，使中苏两国人民在和平建设中结下了难忘的友谊。
    苏联专家对治淮工程最大的帮助是：给中国人民提出了水利建设事业中的科学技术的进步方向。国民党反动统治时期也曾提出过“导淮”，并在美国的专家帮助下订出巨册的导淮计划；但对于如何治好淮河，闹了几十年却无定论，他们的共同着眼点和所有计划的基本内容都是视水为灾难，送到大海里了事。可是，今天新中国治理淮河的根本方针是什么呢？苏联专家布可夫告诉我们：“水，在苏联被认为人民的财富。”根据毛主席“要将淮河的水患变为水利”的指示，布可夫首先研究了淮河的历史水文情况，接着又亲自到淮河流域进行查勘。他打破了过去各求己利、分段治理的陋规，而着手进行淮河流域性的根治计划，帮助我们确定了在淮河上、中游大规模建造水库工程和湖泊蓄洪工程，在下游开辟灌溉总渠和皖北五河县以下淮河干支流分泄等工程计划，要求拦蓄洪水二百亿立方公尺。这就使治淮工程由临时性走上永久性，由消极的除害转向积极的兴利。两年来治淮工程的效益，充分证明中央人民政府治淮方针和苏联专家提出的发展水利的方向是完全正确的。
    治淮工程的各种具体设计工作中，布可夫又毫无保留地把苏联的先进技术交给了中国人民。这不仅直接帮助和加速了治淮工程的进度，更重要的是推动了中国技术思想的重大改革。规划皖北正阳关以上的蓄洪工程时，根据旧的技术观点，曾拟先建筑临时性的草坝求得对洪水的半控制，因为要完全控制洪水必须建造一系列的水闸和堤坝，而这样大的工程被认为在短期内根本不能完成的。布可夫亲自勘察了正阳关以上的地形，经过科学地精密分析，认为建造一个全控制的蓄洪工程完全可能。他又根据我们现有的技术能力和条件，介绍了苏联不用基桩和板桩的先进经验，并帮助设计和鼓励中国人民自己制造液压启闭式的闸门，解决了许多难以解决的困难，终于使润河集分水闸在三个多月中胜利完成。继润河集分水闸胜利的完成，第二年度工程中又在短时间内修成了苏北灌溉总渠的高良涧进水闸和东淝河上的控制闸等巨大工程。
    苏联先进经验应用到治淮工程中的特点是：经济、省时、安全。如苏北区设计的五个水闸工程中，因接受了苏联先进经验，使国家节省了一百五十亿元的财富。但是推广苏联先进经验并不是十分顺利的，不少技术人员的保守思想阻碍了他们的前进。如布可夫建议用不透水的粘土层代替板桩，有些技术人员们就曾发生各种疑问和顾虑：不透水粘土层是有用的，但我们对此无经验，能否真正不透水呢？不透水粘土层与混凝土间的接缝用柏油油毛毡衬麻袋，油毛毡是否会震裂呢？工程指挥机关为了推广苏联先进经验，用苏联成功的实例对干部进行了有计划的教育，并在施工前作了多次试验，证明苏联先进经验是完全正确的，这才消除了不少人的怀疑。
    治淮工程施工期中，苏联专家又不辞劳苦亲临现场给以各种帮助。今年四月，中央人民政府水利部部长傅作义偕同苏联专家布可夫和沙巴页夫视察淮河上游建造的三个水库，提出了许多重要的建议。如白沙水库土坝迎水坡的坡度原为一比三，由于今夏尚不能安装闸门，如水位骤然下降可能会发生坍坡现象，因此建议修改了坡度，并增设戗台；又建议在水库前坝底加铺数十公尺的防漏层，这样水库就更加安全了。
    苏联专家全心全意为中国人民服务的精神和细致认真的工作作风，使每个治淮人员都极为感动，并表示无限的敬仰。施工期间，布可夫曾因过度疲劳，眼病复发三、四次，医生劝告他，要他及时治疗，但是他仍然带病坚持工作。往往因为一个问题不能解决，以致一夜不能入睡。在进行工程设计和水文计算时，布可夫都是在和中国技术人员计算的同时，自己亲自动手试算，然后将计算的结果互相核对。今年视察淮河上游水库工程时，布可夫和沙巴页夫不辞劳苦，爬山涉水，有时甚至还要淋雨，帮助推汽车，经常是夜以继日地工作，充分表现了崇高的国际主义的精神。
    治淮工程中，苏联先进经验的优越性和苏联专家的工作方法，使许多工程人员受到很大教育。一个有经验的工程师说：“我们以往建闸，不论土质好坏，从没有不用桩的，润河集分水闸工程完全不用基桩真是建闸工程上一个大革命。”另一个工程师感动地说：“苏联的先进经验，打破了我们陈旧的工程观点，增强了我们依靠自己的信心，这对新中国今后的水利建设工作，无疑的将起重大的作用。”
