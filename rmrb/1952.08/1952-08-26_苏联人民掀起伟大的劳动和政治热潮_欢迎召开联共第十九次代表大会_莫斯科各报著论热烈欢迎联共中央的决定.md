Xinhua News Agency, August 24th Dispatch: According to TASS, the Soviet people warmly welcomed the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) to convene the 19th Congress. In the past few days, a great labor upsurge and political upsurge has unfolded across the Soviet Union. Hundreds of thousands of working people have been studying the documents issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with great interest. Meetings have been held in factories, mines, collective farms, government offices, and schools. At these meetings, working people have expressed their determination to strengthen the power of the Soviet motherland through selfless labor, and to greet the upcoming Congress with new labor achievements. In Moscow, Leningrad, the Donets coal region, the Dnieper region, Kiev, Minsk, Baku, and other places, many factory workers participated in Stakhanovite work shifts to welcome the Congress. Workers at the Moscow Hammer and Sickle Steel Plant launched a new socialist labor competition, guaranteeing to complete their production plans ahead of schedule and to produce a large number of additional products beyond the plan. Workers in Leningrad, manufacturing orders for communist construction projects and other hydroelectric power stations, also put forward guarantees for manufacturing high-quality products. Machine-building workers and miners in Ukraine, collective farmers in Belarus, loggers in the Karelo-Finnish Republic, workers at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station construction site, and others, all expressed joy and excitement at their meetings, stating: "It is a great happiness to live and work in the Soviet land that is advancing towards communism. We must gloriously complete all the tasks assigned by the Party." To welcome the 19th Congress, collective farmers in various regions have pledged to complete the harvesting work before the opening of the Congress and to fulfill this year's economic plan.
Xinhua News Agency, August 24th Dispatch: Moscow newspapers warmly welcomed the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) to convene the 19th Congress. According to TASS Moscow: "Pravda," "Izvestia," "Trud," "Komsomolskaya Pravda," "Krasnaya Zvezda," and other Moscow newspapers all published editorials on this matter on the 21st and 22nd.
"Pravda's" editorial on the 21st, entitled "Marching Under the Banner of the Lenin-Stalin Party Towards the Victory of Communism," said: "The Soviet people welcome the decision of the Party Central Committee to convene the 19th Congress with the greatest enthusiasm. The draft directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the USSR for 1951-1955 (the Fifth Five-Year Plan) and the draft amendments to the Party Constitution, present to our Party and the Soviet people a magnificent vista of further progress towards communism. The Fifth Five-Year Plan foreshadows a new and enormous upsurge in the Soviet national economy and guarantees a further and significant improvement in the material well-being and cultural standards of the people. In the Soviet Union, peaceful construction is developing on a massive scale, and the welfare of the masses is constantly improving; while in capitalist countries, a frenzied arms expansion movement is accelerating, civil construction funds are being cut, unemployment is increasing, and millions of working people are suffering from poverty and hunger." Pravda continued: "The Soviet people, engaged in peaceful construction labor, are successfully solving the tasks of building communism. The construction of the huge water conservancy projects on the Volga, Don, Dnieper, and Amu Darya rivers, carried out on the initiative of Comrade Stalin, marks a new stage in the development of Soviet productive forces. The first completed great communist project - the Lenin Volga-Don Canal - has already opened to navigation. This historical victory of the Soviet state has had a tremendous impact on international life. For decades, the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to the Lenin-Stalin policy of peace, tirelessly striving for peace and international cooperation, and fighting against the imperialist warmongers. The Lenin-Stalin foreign policy, and the Soviet Union's persistent and resolute struggle for peace and international cooperation, has won the sympathy and support of millions of people in all countries of the world." The editorial concluded: "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, closely united around its Central Committee and united around Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of all progressive humanity, is welcoming its 19th Congress."
Pravda's editorial on the 22nd said: "The convocation of the 19th Party Congress is an event of historical significance in the life of all Soviet people. The draft Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the level of industrial production will increase by approximately 70 percent in five years, and that total industrial output will increase by approximately 12 percent annually. The draft new Five-Year Plan provides all Soviet people with a concrete program for how they should fight daily to strengthen the power of the Soviet motherland. The completion of this plan will enable the Soviet Union to take a big step forward from socialism to communism."
"Izvestia's" editorial on the 22nd said: "The Soviet state has traversed a glorious and heroic path in the years since the 18th Party Congress. These years have witnessed many events of great historical significance - events that have brought about major changes in the political life of the world's people, and have once again irrefutably demonstrated the great power of Leninism and the wise leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party and the unparalleled power of the Soviet state. The draft new Five-Year Plan and the draft amendments to the Party Constitution reflect the great creativity of the Soviet system and its leading force - the Lenin-Stalin Party, and point out new prospects for the creative labor of all the peoples of the Soviet motherland for the victory of communism."

    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联人民热烈欢迎苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会关于召开第十九次代表大会的决定。几天来，苏联全国各地展开了伟大的劳动热潮和政治热潮，成千成万的劳动人民都以极大的兴趣学习苏联共产党中央委员会颁发的文件，各工厂、矿场、集体农场、机关、学校纷纷举行集会，会上劳动人民都表示决心以忘我的劳动加强苏维埃祖国的力量，以新的劳动成就来迎接即将举行的代表大会。莫斯科、列宁格勒、顿尼兹煤区、第聂伯河地区、基辅、明斯克、巴库等地许多工厂职工都参加了迎接代表大会的斯塔哈诺夫式工作班。莫斯科锤子与镰刀钢铁厂的工人们展开了新的社会主义劳动竞赛，他们保证提前完成生产计划，并超过生产计划更多地生产大批产品。列宁格勒为共产主义建设工程及其他水电站制造订货的工人也提出了制造上等产品的保证。乌克兰的机器制造业工人和矿工、白俄罗斯的集体农民、卡累利阿—芬兰共和国的伐木工人、卡霍夫卡水电站工地上的工人等等，都在他们的集会上欢欣鼓舞地表示：能够在走向共产主义的苏维埃国土上生活和工作，便是一个极大的幸福，我们一定要光荣地完成党所规定的一切任务。为了迎接第十九次代表大会，各地集体农民纷纷保证在代表大会开幕前完成收割工作，并完成今年一年的经济计划。
    【新华社二十四日讯】莫斯科报纸热烈欢迎苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会关于召开第十九次代表大会的决定。据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”、“消息报”、“劳动报”、“共青真理报”、
    “红星报”及莫斯科其他各报都分别在二十一日和二十二日就此事发表了社论。
    “真理报”二十一日以“在列宁—斯大林党的旗帜下走向共产主义的胜利”为题的社论说：苏联人民以最大的热情欢迎党中央委员会关于召开第十九次代表大会的决定。第十九次党代表大会关于一九五一年——一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示草案和关于党章的修正草案，在我们的党和苏联人民面前展开了向共产主义进一步迈进的辉煌远景。第五个五年计划预示着苏联国民经济将有新的、巨大的高涨，并保证人民的物质福利与文化水平将有进一步的、显著的提高。在苏联，和平建设正在庞大的规模上发展，群众的福利正在不断提高；而在资本主义国家里面，疯狂的扩张军备运动正在加速进行，民用建设经费被削减，失业人数日益增加，千百万劳动人民正在遭受贫穷和饥饿的折磨。真理报接着说：从事和平建设劳动的苏联人民正在顺利地解决建设共产主义的任务。在斯大林同志的倡议下进行的伏尔加河、顿河、第聂伯河和阿姆河上的巨大水利工程的建设，标志着苏联生产力发展的新阶段。第一个完工的伟大共产主义工程——列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河已经开航了。苏维埃国家的这一个历史性的胜利，对于国际生活发生了巨大的影响。几十年以来，苏联始终坚持着列宁—斯大林的爱好和平的政策，不倦地为争取和平与国际合作、为反对帝国主义战争贩子而斗争。列宁—斯大林的外交政策，苏联为和平与国际合作而进行的始终不懈的坚决斗争，已经赢得了全世界各国千百万人民对苏维埃国家的同情和支持。社论最后说：苏联共产党紧密地团结在它的中央委员会周围、团结在所有进步人类的伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志的周围，迎接它的第十九次代表大会。
    真理报二十二日的社论说：第十九次党代表大会的召开是全体苏联人民生活中有历史重要性的事件。第五个五年计划草案规定使工业生产水平在五年中约提高百分之七十，使工业总产量每年增加约百分之十二。新五年计划草案给全体苏联人民提出了日常应如何为加强苏维埃祖国的力量而斗争的具体纲领。这个计划的完成，将使苏联由社会主义向共产主义前进一大步。
    “消息报”二十二日的社论说：苏维埃国家在第十八次党代表大会以后的这些年中走过了光荣英勇的道路。这些年中发生了许多具有重大历史意义的事件——使世界人民的政治生活发生了重大改变的事件，并且又一次无容置疑地证明了列宁主义思想的伟大力量以及列宁—斯大林党的英明及苏维埃国家无比强大的威力。新五年计划草案和党章的修正草案反映了苏维埃制度及其领导力量——列宁—斯大林党的伟大创造力，并给苏维埃祖国各族人民指出了为着共产主义胜利的创造劳动的新远景。
