    Wang Fengwu Winch Team's New Record for Safe Operation
    Editor: The Wang Fengwu winch team of the No. 1 Mine No. 4 Well of the state-owned Datong Coal Mine, using a makeshift old winch, has created a new record of more than 900 days of safe operation, correcting the erroneous thinking of some workers who believed that "accidents are unavoidable with old machines."
    Wang Fengwu is an old worker with more than 20 years of experience. He is very clear about the entire structure, performance, and accident-prone parts of the winch. He tells all the workers in the team without reservation about the experience he has accumulated in his work. Therefore, every worker in his team knows the "temperament" of the machine very well. Based on the machine's condition, their team regularly inspects the accident-prone parts and establishes a maintenance system. For example, if some parts of the machine often overheat, the workers solve the problem by adjusting the tightness of the screws and frequently adding oil. In order to eliminate hidden accidents, the Wang Fengwu team pays great attention to learning operational techniques. To this end, they established a "Special Technology Research Association."
    The Wang Fengwu team knows that to eliminate accidents, they must rely on the cooperation of workers in related trades. They have established contact with the can loaders at the wellhead and at the bottom of the well, and there are accurate signals for raising and lowering coal and people, starting and stopping the winch, and the speed of the winch. These have created favorable conditions for safe operation, and therefore more than 900 days without accidents.
    Currently, their team is working towards 1,500 days of safe operation. Ma Liang

    王凤梧绞车组安全运转的新纪录
    编辑同志：国营大同煤矿第一矿四号井王凤梧绞车组，使用东拼西凑起来的破绞车，创造了九百多天安全运转的新纪录，纠正了部分工人认为“机器陈旧，避免不了事故”的错误思想。
    王凤梧是有二十多年工作经验的老工人，他对整个绞车的构造、性能和容易发生事故的部位，都非常清楚。他把自己在工作中积累起来的这些经验，都毫无保留地告诉了全组的工人。因而他小组里的每个工人对机器的脾气也都摸的很清楚。针对机器的情况，他们小组对容易发生事故的部位经常进行检查并定出保养制度。比如机器有些部分经常发热，工人们就用调整螺丝的松紧和勤浇油的办法来解决这个问题。为了消灭隐形事故，王凤梧小组非常注意操作技术的学习。为此，他们建立了“特殊技术研究会”。
    王凤梧小组知道要消灭事故，必须依靠有关工种的工人的配合。他们和井口、井底的装罐工人都建立了联系，上下煤上下人，绞车的开、停，以及绞车运转的快慢都有准确的信号。这些，都给安全运转创造了有利条件，因而九百多天无事故。
    目前他们小组正为一千五百天安全运转而努力。马　良
