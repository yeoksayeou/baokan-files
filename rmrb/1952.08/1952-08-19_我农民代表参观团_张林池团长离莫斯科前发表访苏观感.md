Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th (Delayed Dispatch): After a three-and-a-half-month visit to the Soviet capital Moscow and Eastern and Western Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and the Kazakh Republic, the Chinese Farmer Representative Delegation left here on the 13th to return to China. Before his departure, the head of the delegation, Zhang Linchi, made the following remarks to reporters:

    In addition to participating in the May Day celebrations in Moscow and listening to a comprehensive introduction to the Soviet agricultural situation, we divided into five groups and visited seventy-two collective farms, twenty-eight state farms, twenty-two machine tractor stations, twenty-seven scientific research institutions, fifteen agricultural schools, and many great industrial and cultural welfare constructions in Ukraine, the Caucasus, and Kazakhstan, such as the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the Donbas coal mines, the Zhdanov Steel Plant, the Baku submarine oil fields, and the Kharkov Tractor Factory. We went to temperate and subtropical zones, mountainous and plains areas, arid and rainy regions, and areas that mainly focus on grain, industrial crops, or animal husbandry.

    In these three months or so, with the kind care and assistance of the Soviet Communist Party and government, and the warm hospitality of the Soviet people, especially the collective farmers, our visit has been very fruitful. We will never forget such great friendship. We have personally witnessed the Soviet people carrying out great peaceful construction in a vibrant manner, moving towards a communist society. We have personally witnessed the highly mechanized socialist agriculture with collective management, its scale, superior organization, and superb technology are unmatched in the world.

    The collective farms we saw have a land area of hundreds or thousands of hectares or more (each hectare is equal to fifteen mu), up to ten or twenty thousand hectares, hundreds or thousands, or even tens of thousands of heads of cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs, cash income of millions or even tens of millions of rubles or more, and grain income of millions or even more than ten million kilograms. Collective farms develop diversified economies mainly based on a certain crop. Especially since merging into large collective farms, the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry has become better, and production has developed faster.

    The use of land, means of production, and labor are all socialized in collective farms. Collective farms produce in a planned way according to the tasks prescribed by the state. Members are organized into production teams and production groups according to production needs and their respective talents to carry out collective labor, and they are paid according to the quantity and quality of their labor. About 20 percent of the income is drawn each year as a public accumulation fund for expanded reproduction. Each farming household, while ensuring that the main labor force is put into collective production, also retains a quarter to one hectare of homestead garden to operate personal sideline occupations. There, the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man has been fundamentally eliminated, labor has become glorious, the system of remuneration according to labor prevents the emergence of egalitarianism of eating from the same pot, and personal interests and public interests are rationally combined. There, enthusiastic labor competitions are launched everywhere, and labor heroes emerge everywhere.

    We saw that agriculture has been highly mechanized everywhere. The mechanization of the entire process of grain production, including plowing, harrowing, sowing, intertillage, weeding, fertilizing, pest control, harvesting, threshing, and transportation, has reached 80 to 90 percent. The mechanization of industrial crops such as tobacco transplanting, harvesting of sugar beets, cotton, and flax, and pruning of tea is also being rapidly promoted. Milking cows, shearing sheep, watering livestock, preparing feed, planting trees, and digging ponds and canals, many of these heavy labors are done using machines. Machines are used in more than 170 kinds of agricultural work. Mechanization has improved labor conditions and greatly improved labor productivity.

    We saw that advanced science and technology are being used everywhere in agricultural production, especially grass crop rotation systems, seed selection, deep plowing, close planting, fertilization, irrigation, and pest control. We saw that using airplanes to spray pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers also achieved good results. Advanced agricultural technology ensures the annual increase in yields. The combination of agricultural scientific research institutions and practice, the close contact between scientific workers and the vast number of farmers, their spirit of constantly summarizing the experience of advanced farmers and promoting new scientific achievements, as well as the large number of schools and training classes for training agricultural technical personnel – all of this guarantees the continuous progress of agricultural technology.

    We have seen the great spirit and achievements of the Soviet people in transforming nature. Stalin's plan for transforming nature is being rapidly realized, and the plan to build protective forest belts has been completed ahead of schedule everywhere. Just as the Lenin Volga-Don Canal was opened to navigation, we visited the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station in Ukraine and the Mingechaur Hydroelectric Station under construction in Azerbaijan. In vast dry areas, especially in Azerbaijan and the Kazakh Republic, people are carrying out huge water conservancy projects, overcoming the threat of drought, and developing cotton, tobacco, and grape industries.

    We also personally witnessed that collective farmers, no matter what nationality they are, whether they are in the mountains or on the plains, or whether they mainly manage grain or industrial crops, are living a prosperous, cultured, and happy life. We saw that each labor-day remuneration in the collective farms we visited was five kilograms of grain and five to ten rubles, and some were four to five kilograms of grain and twenty to thirty-nine rubles. Generally, collective farm peasants can work more than 300 labor days a year, and they can get a part of supplementary income from their homestead gardens. The families of collective farmers and state farm workers we visited all had clean and comfortable houses, equipped with electric lights and radios, planted with flowers and trees, and subscribed to books and newspapers. Each farm has clubs, libraries, nurseries, kindergartens, and state-established schools, clinics, and maternity rooms.

    During the visit and study, we deeply realized that agriculture must take the road of collectivization. Only collectivization can prevent farmers from taking the painful road of capitalism and lead them to the happy road of socialism. Only collectivization can make good use of machines and advanced agricultural technology, and manage diversified economies, in order to highly develop agricultural productivity, guide farmers to a happy and prosperous life, and ensure the state's adequate supply of grain, livestock products, and industrial raw materials. The development history of the collective farms we visited tells us that to achieve agricultural collectivization, we must first carry out arduous educational work on individual farmers, especially through typical demonstration methods to convince farmers of the superiority of collective management. Experience shows that state support and rewards play a major role in agricultural collectivization. The Soviet state provides collective farms with various conveniences and assistance in terms of land use, machinery, cadres, and credit. The state's tractor stations uniformly control tractors and other agricultural machines, cultivate for collective farms, and become a lever for the state to lead and help collective farms.

    During this visit, we were also deeply moved by the Soviet people's high degree of patriotism and internationalism. The Soviet people love their motherland. They are working selflessly for peaceful construction and for a happy today and tomorrow. The Soviet people love peace and have always stood at the forefront of defending world peace. The Soviet people care about the freedom and liberation of people all over the world and especially love the Chinese people. Wherever we visited, we received fraternal, sincere, and warm welcome. They treated us as if we were their own relatives. The Soviet people's spirit of patriotism and internationalism has left a very deep impression on our minds. We are grateful to the Soviet people. We will resolutely struggle to consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship and defend world peace.

    我农民代表参观团
    张林池团长离莫斯科前发表访苏观感
    【新华社莫斯科十三日电】（迟到）中国农民代表参观团在苏联首都莫斯科和东西乌克兰、南北高加索、哈萨克共和国作三个半月参观后，于十三日离此返国，代表团团长张林池在临行前对记者发表观感如下：
    我们除在莫斯科参加了五一节盛典和听取了关于苏联农业情况的全面介绍之外，曾分五组在乌克兰、高加索、哈萨克各地参观了七十二个集体农场、二十八个国家农场、二十二个机器拖拉机站、二十七个科学研究机关、十五个农业学校和许多伟大的工业和文化福利建设，如第聂伯水电站、顿巴斯煤矿场、日丹诺夫炼钢厂、巴库海底油田、哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂等。我们到了温带和亚热带，山区和平原，干旱和多雨的地区，到了以谷物、以工业作物或以畜牧业为主的地区。
    在这三个多月中，在苏联共产党和政府的亲切关怀和协助下，在苏联人民特别是集体农民的热情款待下，我们的参观有了很大收获。对于这样伟大的友谊，我们将永志不忘。我们亲眼看到了苏联人民在沸腾地进行伟大的和平建设，向着共产主义社会迈进。我们亲眼看到了集体经营的高度机械化的社会主义农业，它的规模之巨大，组织之优越，技术之高超，都是举世无双的。
    我们看到的集体农场，土地面积都在几百几千公顷以上（每公顷合十五市亩），多至一两万公顷，牛马羊猪几百头几千头多至几万头，现金收入几百万多至千万卢布以上，粮食收入几百万以至一千多万公斤。集体农场以某一作物为主地发展着多种经济，特别是合并成大集体农场以来，农牧业配合得更好、生产发展得更快。
    集体农场土地的使用、生产资料和劳动方面都社会化了。集体农场按照国家规定的任务有计划地生产。成员根据生产需要和各自的才能组织在生产队、生产组中进行集体劳动，按照劳动的数量和质量取得报酬。每年从收入中抽出百分之二十左右，作为扩大再生产的公积金。每个农户在保证把主要劳力放在集体生产上，还保有四分之一到一公顷的宅旁园圃来经营个人副业。那里，人剥削人的现象已根本消灭，劳动成为光荣，按劳取酬的制度使吃大锅饭的平均主义的思想无从产生，个人利益和公共利益得到合理的结合。那里，到处展开热烈的劳动竞赛，到处出现劳动英雄。
    我们看到了农业都已经高度机械化。谷物生产的耕地、耙地、播种、中耕、除草、施肥、杀虫、收获、脱粒、运输整个过程机械化达到百分之八、九十。工业作物如烟草的栽苗，甜菜棉花麻类的收获，茶等的剪枝的机械化也在迅速推广中。挤牛奶，剪羊毛，牲畜饮水，饲料的准备，林木种植，池塘和水渠的挖掘，许多这类繁重的劳动都使用机器。机器从事的农业工作在一百七十种以上。机械化改善了劳动条件，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    我们看到了农业生产到处运用着先进的科学技术，特别是牧草作物轮种制、选种、深耕、密植、施肥、灌溉、防治虫害等，我们看到了用飞机喷药杀虫、除草和施肥也得到很好的效果。先进农业技术保证着产量的年年提高。农业科学研究机关和实践相结合，科学工作者和广大农民密切联系起来，他们不断地总结先进农民的经验和推广新的科学成果的精神，以及大批培养农业技术人材的学校和训练班，——这一切保证着农业技术的不断进步。
    我们看到了苏联人民改造自然的伟大气魄和成就。斯大林改造自然计划在迅速地实现，到处提前完成了营造防护林带计划。正是列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河通航的时候，我们参观了乌克兰的第聂伯水电站和阿塞拜疆在建筑中的明格雀尔水电站。在广大的干燥地区，特别是阿塞拜疆和哈萨克共和国，人们进行着巨大的水利建设，战胜着干旱威胁，发展着棉花、烟草和葡萄业。
    我们也亲眼看到了集体农民，不论他们是那一种民族，在山区还是在平原，以经营谷物还是工业作物为主，都过着富裕的有文化的幸福生活。我们所见的集体农场每个劳动日报酬是五公斤粮食和五到十卢布，有些报酬是四、五公斤粮食和二十到三十九卢布。一般集体农场农民每年可作三百多个劳动日，并且从他们宅旁园圃的副业上可得一部分补充收入。我们访问过的集体农民和国家农场工人的家庭，都有整洁舒适的房屋，装备着电灯、收音机，种着花木，订阅着书报。每个农场都有俱乐部、图书馆、托儿所、幼儿园和国家设立的学校、医务所、助产房。
    在参观学习中，我们深深地体会到了：农业必须走集体化的道路。只有集体化才能使农民不走痛苦的资本主义道路，而走幸福的社会主义道路。只有集体化才能很好地使用机器和先进的农业技术，并经营多种经济，以便高度发展农业生产力，引导农民走向幸福富裕的生活，并且保证给国家充足的粮食、畜产品和工业原料。我们所访问的集体农场的发展历史告诉我们：要达到农业集体化，必须首先对个体农民进行艰苦的教育工作，特别是通过典型示范方法使农民信服集体经营的优越性。经验说明：国家的扶助和奖励，对于农业集体化起着重大的作用。苏维埃国家在土地使用、机器、干部、信贷等方面给集体农场以种种方便和帮助。国家的拖拉机站统一掌握着拖拉机和其他农业机器，给集体农场耕种，成为国家领导和帮助集体农场的杠杆。
    在这次参观中我们也深深为苏联人民高度的爱国主义精神和国际主义精神所感动。苏联人民热爱祖国。他们为了和平建设，为了幸福的今天和明天而忘我地劳动着。苏联人民热爱和平，一向站在保卫世界和平的最前列。苏联人民关怀全世界人民的自由和解放并特别热爱中国人民，我们参观所到之处，都受到兄弟般的诚挚、热烈的欢迎，他们对待我们如同对待亲人一样。苏联人民这种爱国主义与国际主义精神在我们思想中留下极深刻的印象，我们感激苏联人民。我们将为巩固中苏友好、保卫世界和平而坚决奋斗。
