Excerpts from Soviet Newspaper Articles

    Leading the Economy Specifically and Effectively
    The "Pravda" published an article by Struyev, Secretary of the Stalin Oblast Committee of Ukraine, on July 29, entitled "Leading the Economy Specifically and Effectively." The following is a summary:
    The improvement of industrial work in the Oblast is the result of enhancing the combat effectiveness of primary Party organizations at the enterprise level, strengthening the Party organizations' influence on the masses, and leading the economy more specifically and effectively.
    As everyone knows, the skillful combination of the Party's political work and economic work is one of the conditions for Bolshevik leadership.
    The Party organization of Gorlovka City has done a lot of work, which has enabled some coal industry trusts in the city to complete the state plan systematically. However, the work of some individual mines is not up to standard. The work of one of the largest mines, Mine No. 8, is particularly unsatisfactory.
    The Party Oblast Committee carefully studied the work of this enterprise. The results showed that although many staff members of the Party Gorlovka City Committee and the Kalinin District Committee often went to the mine, they did not deeply study the production situation and the content of the Party's work.
    The in-depth inspection of the economic activities and Party work of Mine No. 8 by the Oblast Committee revealed the main shortcomings and mobilized all miners to eliminate them. The Party organization and economic leaders focused their attention on overcoming the mine's backwardness. The technical plan formulated with the participation of all miners was guaranteed by the Party's organizational work and mass political work. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members were added to the underground work sections and coal mining teams. Subsequently, five new Party groups were established in some important production sections. Practical assistance was also given in stipulating effective supervision of the mine management's economic activities and in organizing substantive, militant, and progressive political mobilization.
    The upsurge of mass political work in the mine, the improvement of miners' cultural, living, and production conditions, promoted the development of extensive socialist competition, increased labor productivity, and the good use of mining technology. Now the work of Mine No. 8 is done much better, and all its employees are successfully fulfilling their duties.
    To lead the economy specifically means to have a deep understanding of the work of various enterprises, not to judge the work achievements of a city or a district in general and on average, but to judge the work achievements separately according to each mine, each factory, each workshop, and each work section. Only by deeply analyzing the activities of this or that industrial area and analyzing the activities of the factory can correct conclusions be drawn, and weak points can be discovered, so that necessary measures to eliminate shortcomings can be taken in advance. For advanced enterprises, this can more quickly pay attention to and summarize good experiences, and turn this experience into the property of other enterprises.
    The Plan of War, Poverty, and Hunger
    The "Izvestia" published an article by Alekseyev on July 13, refuting the reactionary works of a group of paid scholars of American imperialism in recent times. The following is a summary: At the end of 1951, the book "Economic Mobilization and Stabilization" was published in the United States. This book is a collective creation of a group of scholars at Princeton University, edited by Professors Cardle and Wallace; at the same time, the books "Mobilization Economics and Inflation" by Harvard University Professor Harris and "American Inflation from 1940-1948" by Professor Cardle were also published. The content of these books is similar to the above-mentioned books, as well as the book "Fiscal and Financial Policy" by Professor Lindholm, published a year earlier.
    Scholars bought by monopoly capitalists are doing their best to praise the expansion of armaments, regarding it as a "reliable" means to obtain "full employment" for the whole people and expand the scale of production. These hired scoundrels do not hide the fact that their so-called "full employment" for the whole people refers to: greatly expanding the size of the army, increasing the number of employees in military industries, while greatly reducing civilian industries... and retaining a "small" reserve army of the unemployed (even if it is one to two million people).
    Marxist-Leninist economic science, relying on the study of a large amount of practical material, affirms that the growth of military industries will lead the economy of capitalist countries to one-sided and deformed development. Under the state of a wartime economy, efforts are made to expand armaments, strategic raw materials, military supplies, and other materials necessary for war. At the same time, the production of mass necessities is sharply reduced. The reduction in people's purchasing power caused by military preparations further shrinks the sales market. The expansion of armaments, which intensifies the basic contradiction of capitalism—the contradiction between the social nature of production and the capitalist form of ownership of the results of this production—can only deepen economic chaos and accelerate the inevitable collapse of capitalism.
    Life refutes the predictions of the paid scholars of imperialism about the "post-war prosperity" of American industry. Contrary to this prediction, the index of industrial production in the United States began to decline as early as two years before the end of World War II. In 1949, the industrial production of the United States was only equivalent to 73.6 percent of the highest level of American industrial production in 1943. In 1950, due to the military adventure launched by the American aggressors against the people of Korea and China, the exploitation of the American working class and all working people was greatly strengthened. The barbaric exploitation of the American working people and the plunder of the people of dependent countries and colonies once made the production curve of American industrial products (mainly military supplies) show an upward trend. But by 1951, the growth of American industrial production stopped, and a crisis of overproduction appeared in some civilian industrial sectors.
    Although the American economy, eroded by irreconcilable contradictions, is encountering more and more difficulties, the authors of the book "Economic Mobilization and Stabilization" are suggesting to the American government not only to continue but also to strengthen the militarization of the entire national economy. According to Edward Shaw and Lowry Tarsis, economics professors at Stanford University who participated in the editing of this book, the militarization of industry should increase the scale of American industrial production to 150 percent of the 1950 level by 1956.
    As Lenin said, in the era of imperialism, especially during the general crisis of capitalism, when the bourgeois state "is becoming more and more closely intertwined with the omnipotent alliance of capitalists," monopoly capitalists widely use the financial resources of the state budget to enrich themselves. During periods of war and military preparation, open and covert acts of embezzling the state treasury are especially intensified.
    Therefore, when the American ruling clique and its accomplices in dependent countries are strengthening preparations for a new world war, Cardle, Harris, and other lackeys of monopoly capital are trying to estimate the price that mankind may pay for waging a war to establish the world hegemony of American imperialism. Based on the experience of the previous two world wars and the growing armed power of modern armies, these paid scholars "calculate" the value of human blood and the size of dividends with a cruel calmness. According to Harris's "calculation," the Third World War will make the broad strata of American taxpayers bear an expenditure of three trillion US dollars. In comparison, the American consumption in the Second World War was 300 billion US dollars, and the World War of 1914-1918 was 30 billion US dollars.
    Acting in accordance with the instructions of monopoly capital plunderers, the modern apologists of imperialism arbitrarily say that increasing military budget appropriations can give the development of productivity a "positive impact," can cause industrial prosperity, promote increased employment, eliminate unemployment, and equalize personal income. The lackeys of imperialism repeatedly state that budget expenditures are distributed equally among all classes and people's groups in bourgeois society. They talk about the growing role of taxation in "alleviating" property inequality, the "benefits" of budget deficits, and the "good influence" of public debt on social progress and national wealth growth.
    But reality clearly refutes the hypocritical imperialist propaganda. In the last war and the post-war period, the tax rates of direct and indirect taxes in the United States have increased sharply, new taxes have been implemented, the tax threshold has been lowered, and some preferential treatments for millions of taxpayers have been reduced or even completely abolished. As a result, the number of taxpayers has increased sharply, while the tax revenue has increased from 5.5 billion US dollars in the 1937-1938 budget year to 69.4 billion US dollars in the 1952-1953 budget year, in other words, an increase of 11.6 times!
    Cardle, Wallace, and Harris, like all apologists of imperialism, are "scientifically arguing" for the necessity of implementing a more cruel "squeeze the poor" policy. When making a financial summary of the Second World War, Cardle blamed the US government for "not squeezing hard enough" the pockets of ordinary taxpayers, as if this was "one of the main factors that caused inflation during the war and the post-war period." When making plans for the arms expansion from 1952-1955, the authors of the book "Economic Mobilization and Stabilization" suggested to the US government to expand the number of taxpayers and advocated raising tax rates.
    At the same time, the US government, which serves Wall Street, is using various methods to exempt the profits of monopoly capital from taxation. This government openly stated that levying high taxes on profits would make entrepreneurs lose interest in expanding the production of military necessities. In 1951, the profits of American monopoly capital were 44.8 billion US dollars, compared with 41.4 billion US dollars in 1950 and only 3.3 billion US dollars in 1938.
    The ideologists of American imperialism are doing their best to defend the anti-people domestic policy of American monopoly capital and their foreign expansion policy. They have been silent about the increasingly destructive impact of the rule of American monopoly capital not only on the economy of the United States itself but also on the economic development of the countries in the imperialist camp.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    具体地、有效地领导经济
    “真理报”七月二十九日发表了乌克兰斯大林州州委
    书记斯特鲁耶夫的以“具体地和有效地领导经济”为题
    的论文，摘要如下：
    本州内工业工作的改善，是提高企业基层党组织的战斗力、加强党组织对群众的影响和更具体地和更有效地领导经济的结果。
    众所周知，党的政治工作和经济工作的巧妙结合，是布尔什维克领导条件之一。
    高尔洛夫市的党组织曾作了许多工作，致使城内一些煤业托辣斯有步骤地完成了国家计划。但是，也有个别的矿场的工作不够标准。最大矿场之一——第八号矿场的工作是特别不能令人满意的。
    党的州委会曾仔细地研究了这个企业的工作情况。结果发现党的高尔洛夫市委会和加里宁区委会的许多工作人员虽然也常到矿场上去，但并没有深入地研究生产情况和党工作的内容。
    州委会对第八号矿场的经济活动和党的工作的深入检查，揭露出了主要的缺点并动员全体矿工来消灭它们。党组织和经济领导者把注意力集中在克服矿场的落后上面。在全体矿工参与下所制订的技术方案获得了党的组织工作和群众政治工作的保证。在地下工段，在采煤小队里，又增添了共产党员和青年团员，随后，在一些重要的生产工段，建立起五个新的党小组。在规定对矿场管理当局的经济活动的有效监督方面，在组织实物的、战斗性的、前进性的政治鼓动方面，也都给予了实际的帮助。
    矿场的群众政治工作的高涨，矿工的文化、生活和生产条件的改善，促使广大的社会主义竞赛获得开展，促使劳动生产率提高和对矿业技术的良好使用。现在第八号矿场的工作做得好多了，它的全体员工顺利地执行着自己的职责。
    具体地领导经济——就是说要深刻地了解各企业的工作情况，不是笼统地和平均地判断一个城市或一个区的工业的工作成绩，而是要分别地按照每个矿场、每个工厂、每个车间和每个工段来判断工作的成绩。只有深刻地分析这个或那个工业区的活动、分析工厂的活动情况，才可以作出正确的结论，才能发现薄弱的地方，因此才能事先采取消灭缺点的必要措施。对于先进的企业来说，这样可以更快地注意和总结良好的经验，使这个经验变成其他企业的财产。
    战争、贫穷与饥饿的计划
    消息报七月十三日发表亚历克赛也夫的论文，驳斥近来美帝国主义的一群御用学者们的反动著述，摘要如下：一九五一年末，在美国出版了“经济动员和稳定”一书，这本书是普林斯敦大学一群学者们的集体创作，主编为卡德莱和华莱斯两教授；同时出版的还有哈佛大学教授亨里斯的“动员经济学和通货膨胀”，卡德莱教授的“一九四○——一九四八年美国的通货膨胀”两书，在内容上与上述各书相近的还有早一年出版的林德赫尔姆教授所著的“财政和金融政策”。
    为垄断资本家收买的学者们以全力颂扬军备扩张，把它看做是获得全民“充分就业”和扩大生产规模的“可靠”手段。这些被雇佣的下流文人们没有隐瞒他们的所谓全民“充分就业”就是指：大量扩张军队的编制人数，增加军事工业的从业人员，同时大大缩减民用工业……并保留一个“不大”的失业后备军（即使是一——二百万人也好）。
    马列主义的经济科学依靠对大量实际材料的研究，肯定了军事工业的增长会使资本主义国家的经济走向片面的畸形发展。在战时经济的状态下，尽力扩大军备，战略原料、军需品和进行战争所必需的其他物资的生产，同时，大众必需品的生产则急剧减缩。因军事准备所引起的人民购买力的降低使销售市场更加缩小。使资本主义的基本矛盾——生产的社会性和这种生产成果的资本主义占有形式之间的矛盾——尖锐化的军备扩张，则只能加深经济的混乱并加速不可避免的资本主义崩溃的来临。
    生活驳斥了帝国主义的御用学者们关于美国工业
    “战后繁荣”的预言。与这个预言相反，美国的工业生产指数早在二次大战结束的前两年便开始下降。一九四九年美国的工业生产只相当于一九四三年美国工业生产最高水平的百分之七十三点六。一九五○年由于美国侵略者发动了对朝中人民的军事冒险，于是对美国工人阶级和所有劳动人民的剥削也大大加强。对美国劳动人民的野蛮剥削和对附属国和殖民地人民的掠夺曾使美国工业品（主要是军需品）产额曲线呈现了上升的趋向。但到一九五一年时，美国工业品的生产额的增长即告中止，而在一些民用工业的部门中则出现了生产过剩的危机。
    虽然被不可调和的矛盾所侵蚀的美国经济正在越益遭到更多的困难，但“经济动员和稳定”一书的作者们却向美国政府建议，不仅要继续而且还要加强全部国民经济的军国主义化。根据参预本书编辑工作的斯坦福大学经济学教授爱德华·萧和劳利·塔西斯的意见，工业的军国主义化应当使美国的工业生产规模到一九五六年增加为一九五○年水平的百分之一百五十。
    正如列宁所说，在帝国主义时代，特别是在资本主义总危机时期中，当资产阶级的国家“愈来愈密切地与资本家的全能的联盟打成一片”的时候，垄断资本家就广泛地利用国家预算的财源使自己致富。在战争和军事准备时期中，公开的和隐蔽的盗窃国库的行为尤其被加紧进行着。
    因此，当美国统治集团和它的附属国的助手们在加强对新的世界战争的准备的时候，卡德莱、亨里斯和其他垄断资本的走卒们就企图预计，为进行建立美帝国主义的世界霸权的战争，人类可能付出的代价。根据前两次世界大战的经验及增长中的现代军队的武装威力，这些御用学者们以一种残忍的冷静来“计算”人类血液的价值和股息的大小。依照亨里斯的“计算”，第三次世界大战将使美国广大阶层的纳税人担负三万亿美元的支出，与之相较，第二次世界大战美国的消耗是三千亿美元，而一九一四——一九一八年的世界大战则是三百亿美元。
    遵照垄断资本掠夺者们的指示而行动的帝国主义的现代辩护人武断地说，仿佛军事性预算拨款的增加可以给予生产力的发展以“积极的影响”，可以引起工业的繁荣、促进就业的增加，消灭失业并平均个人的所得。帝国主义的仆从们在反复地申述，仿佛预算支出是在资产阶级社会的各阶级和人民团体中平均分配着，他们谈到课税对“减轻”财产不均现象的作用在增长，谈到预算赤字的“利益”，谈到公债对于社会进步和国家财富增长的“良好影响”。
    但是现实明显地驳斥了虚伪的帝国主义的宣传。在上次大战和战后时期中，美国的直接和间接税的税率急剧提高，实行了新的课税，税的起征点降低了，对数百万纳税人的一些优待被减少或者竟完全废止了。结果是使纳税者的人数急剧增加，而税收数字则由一九三七——一九三八预算年度的五十五亿美元增加到一九五二——一九五三年度的六百九十四亿美元，换句话说，就是增加了十一点六倍！
    卡德莱、华莱斯和亨里斯正像所有帝国主义的辩护者那样，“在科学地论证”更残酷地推行“压榨穷人”政策的必要性。卡德莱在为第二次世界大战作财政总结时，曾责备美国政府，说它“没有用力挤压”普通纳税人的口袋，仿佛这正是“造成战争和战后时期中通货膨胀的主要因素之一”。在为一九五二——一九五五年的军备扩张作计划时，“经济动员和稳定”一书的作者们向美国政府建议扩大纳税人的数字，并主张提高税率。
    与此同时，为华尔街服务的美国政府正在以各种方法使垄断资本的利润免受课税。这个政府公开地表示，对利润课以高税会使企业家失去对扩大生产军用必需品的兴趣。一九五一年美国垄断资本的利润是四百四十八亿美元，与之相较，一九五○年是四百一十四亿美元，而一九三八则只有三十三亿美元。
    美帝国主义的思想家们正在尽力为美国垄断资本反人民的国内政策和他们的对外扩张政策辩护。美国垄断资本的统治不仅对美国本身的经济而且对帝国主义阵营各国的经济发展所产生的破坏影响均愈益增加，他们对此则一直缄口不言。
