    Youth League Member Xiao Zhenxing Rushes to Plug the Breach
    Editor: The crops in Huzhu Village, Eighth District, Changbei County, Liaoxi, are growing luxuriantly. When the villagers mention this year's crops, they say, "If it weren't for that young man Xiao Zhenxing, the village's more than one hundred hectares of crops wouldn't look like this!"
    Xiao Zhenxing is the secretary of the Youth League branch in Huzhu Village. On the afternoon of May 18th this year, he and four other Youth League members went to the Fourth Village to attend a meeting. On the way, they saw that the water upstream of the river embankment was unusually turbulent. They immediately ran over and saw that the river water was continuing to rise, and a section of the dangerous embankment more than one zhang long was in danger of breaching. Because they were going to a meeting, they did not bring tools for repairing the embankment. Xiao Zhenxing said, "I'll stay here to watch the embankment, you quickly mobilize the masses to come to the rescue."
    Xiao Zhenxing patrolled the embankment, extremely anxious. Suddenly, the low-lying part of the river embankment made a "whoosh" sound, and a five-foot-long breach opened up. Xiao Zhenxing immediately pounced on it, using his entire body to block the breach. He lay across the breach, tightly closing his mouth, raising half of his head, and enduring the fierce impact of the floodwater rushing down from the mountains.
    The masses in Sanjianfang Village, about half a li away, heard that the river embankment was about to breach, and immediately gathered more than thirty people, bringing tools, and rushed to protect the embankment. They rescued the exhausted Xiao Zhenxing and began to block the breach. Liu Kui, who had suffered from floods every year before liberation, said, "In the past, my family's crops were flooded every year. After liberation, the People's Government built river embankments, and we only had a few good years. If it weren't for Xiao Zhenxing this year, our crops would have been ruined again." The masses competed to invite Xiao Zhenxing to their homes to rest and eat. But Xiao Zhenxing, after catching his breath for a while, braced himself and went with the other four Youth League members to the Fourth Village to attend the meeting. Wang Kehuang

    青年团员萧振兴抢堵决口
    编辑同志：辽西昌北县八区互助村的庄稼长得很茂盛。老乡们提起今年的庄稼就说：“要不是萧振兴这小伙子，全村一百多垧庄稼那能有这个样子！”
    萧振兴是互助村的青年团支部书记。今年五月十八日下午，他和四个青年团员到四屯去开会，在路上看到河堤上游的水异常凶猛。他们立刻跑过去，看见河水正在继续上涨，一丈多长的险堤有决口的危险。他们因为是去开会，并没有携带修堤的工具。萧振兴说：“留下我看堤，你们快去发动群众前来抢险。”
    萧振兴在堤上巡视着，十分焦急。那河堤的低洼处突然“涮”的一声，开了一个五尺来长的口子。萧振兴立刻扑上去，用整个身体堵住决口。他横卧在决口上，紧闭着嘴，抬起半个头，忍受着山上冲下来的洪水的凶猛撞击。
    离这里约有半里路的三间房屯的群众听说河堤要决口了，立时聚拢了三十多人，带着工具，赶来护堤。他们救下精疲力竭的萧振兴，动手堵住决口。在解放前历年遭受水灾的刘魁说：“过去我家的庄稼年年被淹，解放后人民政府修了河堤，才过了几年好光景。今年要不是萧振兴，我们的庄稼又完啦。”群众争着要萧振兴到他们家里休息、吃饭。但萧振兴喘息了一会儿，又撑起身子和其他四个团员到四屯去开会了。  王克煌
