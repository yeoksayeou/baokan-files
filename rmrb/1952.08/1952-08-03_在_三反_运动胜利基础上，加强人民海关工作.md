    Strengthening People's Customs Work on the Basis of the Victory of the "Three-Anti" Movement
    Kong Yuan, Director of the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government
    (I)
    When customs is mentioned, people easily associate it with the customs of old China, regarding it as a mere tax collection agency, and neglecting the fact that "the customs policy and foreign trade policy of New China have become important tools for protecting the development of New China's industry." (Liu Shaoqi) The customs agency is an important component of the state apparatus that implements foreign trade policy, and the close integration of customs work and foreign trade work is inseparable. This is a major characteristic that distinguishes the independent and autonomous People's Customs from the semi-colonial old China customs. The basic tasks of New China's customs are: to practically supervise import and export trade, collect tariffs, and crack down on smuggling, thereby implementing the state's foreign trade control and protection trade policies. Over the past two years, China's foreign trade has been rapidly recovering and developing on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The total trade volume in 1950 far exceeded the highest figures in many years before liberation, and 1951 increased by 33 percent compared to 1950. The total trade value between China and the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries has exceeded that with capitalist countries. The semi-colonial nature of foreign trade, which was long controlled by imperialism in old China, has been fundamentally transformed in the short span of two years since the founding of the country.
    Under the leadership of the Central People's Government and with the help of local Party and government organs, New China's customs has adapted to the above-mentioned foreign trade situation, determined new work directions, and implemented fundamental customs reforms by reforming organizational systems, adjusting staff composition, transforming ideological styles, formulating the Provisional Customs Law of the People's Republic of China and customs tariffs, and unifying national operations; thereby gradually strengthening the supervision and management of foreign trade, opposing the "blockade" and "embargo" of American imperialism, and preventing economic aggression by capitalist countries. In addition, based on the socialist nature of state-owned trade with the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries, the economic mutual assistance and cooperation between fraternal countries, and the characteristics of planned and large-scale centralized management, a new type of customs supervision system and centralized tax payment system have been created. Generally speaking, in the past two years, customs work has played a certain role in implementing the state's foreign trade control and protection trade policies, completing tariff revenue tasks, cracking down on illegal smuggling activities, and protecting the recovery and development of production. The promulgation and implementation of the Provisional Customs Law of the People's Republic of China has changed the face of Chinese customs and laid the foundation for the construction of People's Customs. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have proved that the Customs Law has become a powerful weapon against the "three evils," "five poisons," and all smuggling and illegal activities. However, due to the deep-rooted influence of the old customs traditions of the Chinese and foreign bourgeoisie, and insufficient vigilance against the attacks of illegal bourgeois elements after liberation, there are still considerable weaknesses and loopholes in customs business systems and working methods, which greatly weakens the actual supervisory role of customs in foreign trade.
    (II)
    Based on the experience of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the influence of bourgeois ideology in foreign trade and customs work is first manifested in neglecting the role of state control policies and actual customs supervision. Many staff members do not realize that the import and export license system is the primary key to implementing foreign trade control and protection trade policies, and lack the viewpoint of fighting against smuggling activities. In actual work, they do not proceed from an overall and holistic viewpoint, isolating customs work from foreign trade management work, and are only satisfied with the fact that the foreign trade administration has issued a license, and the customs will release the goods. Sometimes, licenses are issued incorrectly, or the goods do not match the license, or even if there is no license, they are easily released. The result of various forms of neglect of the license system is actually a partial abandonment of the task of implementing foreign trade control, causing many losses. Facts have proved that if customs can conscientiously implement actual supervision, many losses can be avoided. For example, the case of the "Xie Mao Hang" in Wuhan Customs, which falsely reported the names and specifications of goods, disrupted the licensing system, and evaded taxes and exchanged foreign currency, prevented the occurrence of similar cases in the future and avoided significant and greater losses.
    Secondly, in the understanding of cases of foreign exchange evasion and speculation, there is a so-called view of emphasizing taxes and downplaying foreign exchange, and a laissez-faire attitude is adopted in actual work. Obviously, foreign exchange evasion and speculation are essentially smuggling activities of gold and silver currency, which not only evade foreign exchange controls, but also disrupt foreign trade controls and customs laws. Therefore, strict implementation of foreign exchange controls must be one of the important responsibilities of customs in implementing foreign trade control and protection trade policies. In the past, we had an unclear understanding of this issue and did not handle foreign exchange evasion and speculation from the perspective of overall foreign trade control. We only examined the price of goods from a purely tax perspective, neglecting to check whether there was foreign exchange evasion and speculation based on the actual name, specifications, quantity, and price of imported and exported goods. Therefore, in practice, we abandoned the responsibility of implementing foreign exchange controls and indulged in foreign exchange evasion and speculation. Even if cases of foreign exchange evasion and speculation were found, they were not strictly handled as smuggling cases.
    Third, in the work of inspecting goods, there is a strong purely tax-oriented view, and there is a failure to deeply recognize that the inspection work is a major link in the actual supervision of cargo transportation by the People's Customs, and a lack of supervision and anti-smuggling perspectives. Therefore, even if, from a formal point of view, the goods and the license are consistent, a large number of smuggled goods, damaged goods, and substandard goods are privately transported or mixed in the cargo. On the other hand, because most export goods are tax-free, except for individual customs, there is generally little supervision and inspection of export goods, forming a serious loophole for export smuggling, which in turn creates conditions for import smuggling.
    Fourth, the mistaken one-sided emphasis on "taking into account both public and private interests," "treating everyone equally," and "freedom of domestic trade" has led to a lack of vigilance against the destructive nature of illegal private merchants' "five poisons," and lax supervision and inspection of their illegal activities. In price surveys, there is no clear reliance on state-owned enterprises, reliance on shop employee unions and activists, and prices are often reduced (tax evasion) or increased (foreign exchange speculation) based solely on quotations from private merchants, making tax evasion and foreign exchange evasion appear to be "legal." For goods with serious smuggling, timely and proactive cooperation with relevant departments to take effective control measures is lacking, allowing them to circulate freely in the domestic market, forming a major loophole.
    Fifth, there is insufficient vigilance against the impurity of customs organizational components, the intricate historical relationships between some old personnel and bourgeois elements, the filth and poison left over from the old customs, and the danger of bourgeois erosion of our revolutionary ranks. There is a lack of strict and systematic transformation and review in the ideological education, use, and deployment of staff. The "Three-Anti" movement exposed the phenomenon of corruption in the customs system, especially in the South China Customs, which has a particularly complex environment, which is very serious.
    (III)
    In order to adapt to the ever-expanding foreign trade situation and meet the large-scale economic construction tasks on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, in the future, we should focus on giving play to the actual supervisory role of customs in foreign trade, build a sound and strong customs organization, systematically criticize the anti-people customs thinking of the bourgeoisie, eliminate the influence of the old Chinese customs traditions, continuously improve business and working methods, implement the Customs Law, and strive to both facilitate the expansion of foreign trade and accelerate the construction of the people's economy, and prevent the "five poisons" and "three evils."
    First, in order to expand foreign trade, we must strengthen the supervision and management of trade with capitalist countries, adhere to the provisions of the Customs Law, establish an actual supervision system based mainly on import and export licenses for the export and import of various goods and currencies, protect legitimate trade, and strictly supervise private import and export trade, so as to promote the organization and planning of public-private trade and overcome blind competition and chaos. To this end, it is necessary to closely integrate the actual supervision of customs with the administrative management of foreign trade; strengthen the supervision of import and export foreign exchange, prevent foreign exchange evasion and speculation, and stipulate that foreign exchange evasion and speculation should be handled by customs as smuggling cases. Establish an overall view of customs supervision of cargo transportation, inspection and tax assessment, and investigation and prohibition of smuggling. Clarify that the inspection work is an important link in customs supervision and anti-smuggling, and the responsibility of the inspectors is not only for pure tax collection, but also to prevent smuggling and foreign exchange evasion. Under necessary conditions, customs supervision and anti-smuggling personnel should also participate in the inspection work.
    Second, systematically and universally launch a struggle against smuggling. Strengthen the customs' anti-smuggling force, improve anti-smuggling methods, and establish a systematic investigation and research work. Cracking down on smuggling should not only become an important link in the current entire customs work, but also mobilize a wider range of forces. Especially in areas where smuggling is serious, under the guidance and help of local government organs and groups, relevant departments should be coordinated to launch a broad mass patriotic anti-smuggling movement, and implement the policy of combining customs' specialized anti-smuggling work with the mass anti-smuggling struggle. Strictly implement the law that all import and export cargo and passenger luggage are only allowed to pass through customs-designated locations, support customs in all localities in handling cases according to law, and severely punish those who violate laws and regulations.
    Third, gradually improve the supervision, inspection, and taxation system for cargo transportation to the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries based on necessity and possibility. It should be clearly recognized that the nature of trade with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries is different from that with capitalist countries. There are no issues such as aggression and sabotage in our trade with fraternal countries. Therefore, foreign trade control is not to perform the duty of protecting the national economy from aggression and sabotage, but to become a means for me and fraternal countries to plan and mutually promote economic development. If we do not understand this fundamental characteristic and mechanically apply the customs supervision methods for trade with capitalist countries, it is completely wrong. For the current Sino-Soviet railway intermodal transport cargo, the simplest supervision and inspection procedures should be implemented in order to speed up cargo transportation, promote the planning of cargo transportation and handover, and improve and promote the centralized tax payment system that has already been implemented. However, it is also completely wrong to think that there is no need for supervision of cargo transportation to fraternal countries, and that customs will have nothing to do. Customs work should and can play a certain important role in supervising and inspecting the actual implementation of national trade plans, collecting customs statistical materials necessary for national economic plans, and preventing or proving possible shortcomings, accidents, losses, etc. in the loading, unloading, storage, handover, transportation, and delivery of goods.
    Fourth, adjust institutions, transfer cadres, train new-style customs staff, and strengthen the ideological, organizational, and institutional construction of the People's Customs. Based on the new situation of foreign trade and the principle of streamlining, study the division of labor and cooperation between customs and foreign trade management agencies, and prepare for the establishment and merger of some customs institutions nationwide. With the focus on strengthening the customs at major ports of trade with capitalist countries, reallocate leading cadres within the scope of national customs, adjust the composition of staff, boldly promote cadres, and solve the current difficulties in the shortage of backbone personnel. Conduct in-depth review of business thinking, summarize the experience of the Three-Anti movement, systematically strengthen political education for employees, further draw ideological boundaries, overcome the influence of bourgeois thinking, transform the work style, and establish the view of relying on the masses and relying on the whole to do a good job in customs work.
    All customs work should be carried out in order to implement Chairman Mao's instructions on increasing production and practicing economy, continue to strive for streamlining and economy within the customs itself, eliminate corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; and should give play to the active role of customs in increasing production and practicing economy by improving the actual effectiveness of customs work, implementing foreign trade control, completing national tax revenue tasks, cracking down on smuggling and tax evasion, preventing foreign exchange evasion and speculation, promoting the organization and planning of cargo transportation, and avoiding the backlog and loss of goods.

    在“三反”运动胜利基础上，加强人民海关工作
    中央人民政府海关总署署长  孔原
    （一）
    提起海关，人们容易联想到过去旧中国的海关，把它看成是单纯的税收机关，忽略了“新中国的海关政策与对外贸易政策已经成为保护新中国工业发展的重要工具。”（刘少奇）海关机构是实行对外贸易政策的国家机关的重要组成部分，海关工作与对外贸易工作的密切结合不可分离，这是独立自主的人民海关区别于半殖民地的旧中国海关的重大特点。新中国海关的基本任务是：实际监管进出口贸易，征收关税和查禁走私，以此来贯彻实行国家对外贸易管制与保护贸易的政策。两年多来，我国对外贸易，在平等互利基础上，正在日益迅速的恢复发展中，一九五○年贸易总额即远超过解放前许多年的最高数字，一九五一年比一九五○年又增长了百分之三十三。我国对苏联和新民主主义国家的贸易总值已超过对资本主义国家的贸易。旧中国长期受帝国主义控制的半殖民地性对外贸易，在开国以来短短的两年时间中已经根本转变了。
    新中国海关在中央人民政府的领导和各地党政机关的帮助下，适应上述对外贸易的情况，确定了新的工作方向，并从改建组织制度，调整员工成分，改造思想作风，制定中华人民共和国暂行海关法和海关税则，统一全国业务等方面，来贯彻海关的根本改革；从而逐步加强对外贸易的监督管理，反对美帝国主义的“封锁”“禁运”，防止资本主义国家的经济侵略。此外，并基于国营对苏联及各新民主主义国家贸易的社会主义性质，兄弟国家间经济上互助合作，有计划的、大量集中的经营方式等特点，创建了新型的海关监管制度和集中纳税制度。总的说，两年多来，海关工作对贯彻国家对外贸易管制与保护贸易政策，完成关税税收任务，查禁非法走私行为，保护生产的恢复与发展起了一定作用。中华人民共和国暂行海关法的颁布实施，改变了中国海关的面貌，奠定了人民海关建设的基础，在“三反”“五反”运动中证明海关法已成为反对
    “三害”“五毒”及一切走私违法行为的有力武器。但由于过去海关传统的中外资产阶级影响根深柢固，和解放后对资产阶级不法分子的进攻警惕不够，因而在海关业务制度工作方法上还存在相当严重的弱点漏洞，大大削弱了海关在对外贸易中的实际监督作用。
    （二）
    根据“三反”“五反”运动的经验，在对外贸易与海关工作中的资产阶级思想影响，首先表现在忽视国家管制政策和海关实际监督的作用，许多工作人员没有认识进出口许可制度是贯彻执行对外贸易管制与保护贸易政策的首要关键，缺乏与走私行为作斗争的观点。在实际工作中，不从全面的整体的观点出发，把海关工作与对外贸易管理工作孤立起来，只满足于形式上的外管机关发了许可证，海关就放行，有时许可证发错了或证货不符甚或无证也轻易放行了事，种种忽视许可制度的结果，实际上部分的放弃实行对外贸易管制的任务，造成许多损失。事实证明：如果海关能认真执行实际的监督，是可以避免许多损失的，如武汉关查获的“协贸行”伪报货物名称、规格，破坏许可制度，偷税套汇案件，就防止了以后类似案件的发生，避免了重大的和更多的损失。
    其次表现在对逃汇套汇案件的认识上，存在着所谓重税轻汇的观点，而在实际工作中采取放任态度。显然，逃汇套汇实质上就是金银货币的走私行为，不仅是逃避外汇管制，同时是破坏对外贸易管制与海关法令。因此，严格执行外汇管制必须是海关贯彻对外贸易管制与保护贸易政策的重要职责之
    一。过去我们对这一问题认识不清，没有从整个对外贸易管制的观点出发来处理逃汇套汇问题，只是单纯地从税收观点审查货价，忽视了从实际进出口货物的名称、规格、数量、价格，审核有无逃汇套汇情况，因而就在实际上放弃了执行外汇管制的职责，放任了逃汇套汇的行为，即使查到逃汇套汇案件，也就没有严格按照走私案件处理。
    第三，在查验货物工作中存在着浓厚的单纯税收观点，未能深刻认识验货工作是人民海关实际监管货运的一个主要环节，缺乏监管和查私观点。因此，即使从形式上看，货物和许可证是相符的，但大批私货、坏货、次货却在货运中被私运或蒙混夹带进来。另一方面因出口货大部免税，除个别海关外，一般对出口货物很少监管查验，形成了出口走私的严重漏洞，反过来又为进口走私造成条件。
    第四，错误地片面强调“公私兼顾”、“一视同仁”、“国内贸易自由”，对不法私商“五毒”的破坏性缺乏警惕，对其违法行为放松了监管查验工作。在物价调查中，没有明确依靠国营企业，依靠店员工会和店员积极分子的思想，常常仅凭私商报价，无原则地降低货价（漏税）或提高货价（套汇），使偷税漏税逃汇套汇行为披上“合法”的外衣。对走私严重的物品，未能及时主动的和有关主管部门配合，采取有效的管制办法，任其在国内市场自由流通，形成很大的漏洞。
    第五，对海关组织成分的不纯，部分旧人员与资产阶级分子间千丝万缕的历史关系，旧海关遗留下来的污毒和解放后资产阶级对于我们革命队伍侵蚀的危险性警惕不足，在工作人员的思想教育、使用配备上，缺乏严格的系统的改造和审查。“三反”运动中暴露出海关系统的贪污现象，尤其是环境特别复杂的华南海关，十分严重。
    （三）
    为在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，适应日益扩大的对外贸易形势，迎接大规模的经济建设任务，今后应以发挥海关在对外贸易中的实际监督作用为中心，建设健全有力的海关组织，有系统地批判资产阶级的反人民海关的思想，肃清旧中国海关传统的影响，不断改进业务和工作方法，贯彻实行海关法，力求既有利于扩大对外贸易，加速人民经济建设，又能防止“五毒”和“三害”。
    第一，为了扩大对外贸易，必须加强对资本主义国家贸易的监督管理，坚持海关法的规定，对各种货物货币的输出输入，建立以进出口许可证件为主要依据的实际监管制度，保护合法的贸易，严密对私营进出口贸易的监管，以促进公私贸易的组织性计划性，克服盲目竞争与混乱现象。为此必须使海关的实际监督和对外贸易的行政管理密切结合起来；加强对进出口外汇的监管，防止逃汇套汇行为，规定逃汇套汇行为应由海关按走私案件处理。树立海关监管货运、验估征税、查禁走私等各项业务的整体观点。明确验货工作为海关监管、查私的重要环节，验货员的责任，不仅在于单纯税收，并应防止走私逃汇，在必要条件下，海关监管、查私人员应同时参加查验工作。
    第二，有系统地普遍展开反对走私的斗争。加强海关查私力量，改善查私方法，建立系统的调查研究工作。查禁走私不仅应成为当前全部海关工作的重要环节，而且必须动员更广泛的力量，尤其在走私严重地区，应在地方政府机关团体的指导帮助下，协同有关部门，发动广泛的群众性的爱国主义的反走私运动，贯彻海关专门查私工作与群众反走私斗争相结合的方针。严格实行一切进出口货运旅客行李只准经由设关地点通过的法令，支持各地海关依法办事，严惩违法乱纪分子。
    第三，根据必要与可能，逐步改进对苏联及各新民主主义国家货运的监管验征制度。应明确认识对苏联及人民民主国家和对资本主义国家的贸易性质不同。我们与兄弟国家间的贸易，不存在侵略破坏等类的问题，因而对外贸易管制不是执行保护本国经济使不受侵略、破坏的职责，而是成为我与兄弟国家有计划的相互促进经济发展的手段。如果不了解这个根本特点，机械地搬用对资本主义国家贸易的海关监管办法，是完全错误的。对目前中苏铁路联运货物，应执行最简便的监管查验手续，以便加速货运，促进货运与交接的计划性，并将业已实行的集中纳税制度，加以改善和推广。但因此就以为对兄弟国家的货运没有必要监管，海关将无事可做，也是完全不对的。海关工作在监督检查国家贸易计划实际执行情况，收集国家经济计划所必须的海关统计材料，预防或证明对货物装卸、存储、交接、运发过程中可能发生的缺点事故损耗等方面，应该而且可能起一定的重要作用。
    第四，调整机构，调配干部，培养新式海关工作人员，加强人民海关的思想建设、组织建设与制度建设。根据对外贸易的新情况与精简的原则，研究海关与对外贸易管理机构的分工配合问题，准备全国海关若干机构的增设与裁并。并以加强对资本主义国家贸易各主要口岸海关为重心，在全国海关范围内重新调配领导干部，调整工作人员的成分，大胆提拔干部，解决当前骨干缺乏的困难。进行深入的业务思想检讨，总结三反的经验，有系统地加强员工政治教育，进一步划清思想界限，克服资产阶级的思想影响，改造工作作风，树立依靠群众依靠整体做好海关工作的观点。
    海关的一切工作，均应为了贯彻毛主席关于增产节约的指示，继续努力于海关本身的精简节约，肃清贪污浪费与官僚主义；并应从提高海关工作的实际成效，贯彻实行对外贸易管制，完成国家税收任务，查禁走私漏税，防止逃汇套汇，促进货运组织性计划性，避免货物积压损耗等方面发挥海关在增产节约中的积极作用。
