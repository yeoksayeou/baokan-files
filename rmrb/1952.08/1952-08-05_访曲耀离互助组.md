Visiting Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team
By our reporter Lu Sheng

A few days before "July 1st," I visited Qu Yaoli, a national model for high cotton yields, and the mutual aid team he leads. I arrived at Qu Yaoli's home before noon. The yard was quiet and empty then. A small blackboard hung on the courtyard wall, with the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team's agricultural activities for the most recent ten days written on it:

"(1) The entire team will universally carry out the third irrigation, completing five cotton irrigations in ten days. Pruning and topping should also be completed simultaneously.
(2) Pay attention to preventing pests and diseases at all times, thoroughly eliminate cotton aphids, and ensure that cotton seedlings are not damaged in the slightest.
(3) Apply two large carts of manure per mu to the wheat fields for replanting. Each person should first complete the task of replanting one mu in ten days. (Note: Because it has not rained since the wheat harvest until now—June 23rd—they plan to ensure that each person utilizes all water sources to complete the replanting of one mu. 'Replanting' refers to sowing autumn crops in the harvested wheat fields.)
(4) The entire team will prepare patriotic public grain in three days, ensuring that every grain is full and every measure is clean.
(5) The entire team will strengthen current affairs and political study. Male and female team members will take time to attend people's schools every day, and the team will collectively read the newspaper once every five days."

According to local cadres, the origin of this blackboard is as follows: When Qu Yaoli visited factories in Beijing and Tianjin last year, he saw that workers wrote their main tasks on the blackboard every day to carry out production in a planned manner. He thought this method was very good, so he advocated implementing this method in the mutual aid team this year.

At this time, Qu Yaoli's wife, Hui Zhongkan, was cooking lunch in the kitchen. She said, "It's dry now. To make the cotton seedlings grow well, we have to irrigate and hoe diligently. They have to go to the fields before dawn and eat breakfast and lunch in the fields, and they still come back late at night. Sometimes, if they can't finish irrigating a field, they have to irrigate it at night with the lights on." After a while, lunch was ready, and Qu Yaoli's niece-in-law, Xiulan, and Qu Yaoli's child carried the food and drove the mule to deliver food to the field. They drove a horse back around one o'clock. Hui Zhongkan explained, "Last year, there was a bumper cotton harvest, and the team's mules and horses increased to six (from the original three). This year, livestock can graze and pull waterwheels in shifts. The livestock rests, but people don't."

In the afternoon, we went to see the cotton fields of Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team. Looking southwest from the village, the fields were a sea of oily green, with male and female farmers in white clothes everywhere. Some were hoeing weeds, some were bending over to prune branches, and some were watching the ridges and irrigating cotton. Everyone was working hard and happily. Every large cotton field had a well, and livestock were constantly pulling waterwheels beside the wells.

After walking for a while, we saw an old man meticulously trimming cotton branches. He would trim the branches in his cotton field for a while, and then go to another cotton field nearby to compare them. The one he was comparing it to was the experimental field of Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team. The cotton seedlings in this field grew particularly well. Other cotton seedlings were only seven or eight inches tall, but these cotton seedlings were already more than a foot tall, and the leaves were lush, the stems were strong, and the color was dark green. He told us, "This year, in order to teach his cotton planting techniques to everyone, Qu Yaoli opened this 'small farm' for experiments. This year, we are experimenting with what kind of seeds to plant, how many seedlings to keep, and how much fertilizer to apply, so that we can increase the yield. Next year, we will use this method to plant cotton." The old man said, "This method is very good. This year, we are all improving our techniques by looking at the cotton planting methods in this field. When the experiments are successful in the fall, we will have more basis for planting cotton next year."

The cotton fields of Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team are about three miles away from the village. As it was getting dark, all the members of Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team were still continuing to irrigate the cotton in a tense manner. Qu Yaoli and Deputy Team Leader Gao Jindong said, "Now the weather is dry. After irrigating the first water and hoeing the weeds, we have to irrigate the second water. Now our entire team is universally irrigating the third water. We want to ensure that the cotton seedlings are not damaged in the slightest in the dry and windy days, and produce more and better cotton for the country."

Last fall, Qu Yaoli met Chairman Mao in Beijing, participated in the celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and visited steel mills, mechanized farms, textile factories, and farm implement factories in Beijing. His political awareness has greatly improved. When he returned to the village, he promoted everywhere: Organize, study each other, improve technology; learn from the working class's collective production methods and universally increase the unit area yield of cotton.

Since then, Qu Yaoli and his mutual aid team have taken the lead in responding to every call from the People's Government and every hope of the working class for cotton farmers. Last year, under the influence of this team, the entire Qu Zhuangtou administrative village ginned all the cotton to full specifications and sold and stored it all to the state.

This spring, in order to take the lead in the patriotic increase production competition, he first rectified the mutual aid team he led. After detailed discussions by all team members, a production increase plan for 1952 was formulated, requiring that the team's 50 mu of irrigated cotton fields produce an average of 630 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 180 jin compared to the average yield of 450 jin per mu last year. Among them, Qu Yaoli's 22 mu of cotton fields must produce an average of 780 jin of seed cotton per mu. The whole team will also create a new record of 1,000 jin per mu in three mu of high-yield fields. After the whole team formulated the production increase plan, they jointly launched a challenge competition to cotton farmers across the country with Wu Xuanwen, a cotton planting model from Jiangxi Province, and Zhang Defang, a cotton planting model from Hebei Province.

This year, Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team's cotton fields have been plowed four times and harrowed four times (originally planned three plows and three harrows), and harrowed eight times (originally planned six harrows), and deeply plowed once with a new-style plow, making the soil fine, broken, and even. Their mutual aid team applied 10,000 jin of base fertilizer (sheepfold manure) per mu of cotton field, and they also bought 2,400 jin of oil cake and 479 jin of fertilizer powder as top dressing. The team's two-mu experimental field and three-mu high-yield field averaged 13,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu (originally planned 10,000 jin), and 80 jin of bone meal (originally planned 15 jin). They also plan to use 120 jin of soybean cake and fertilizer powder as top dressing.

This spring, the People's Government called for drought prevention and drought resistance. Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team took the lead in drilling wells and carrying water to irrigate wheat, promoting a well-drilling campaign throughout the village. Soon, 67 new wells were drilled in the entire village, increasing the village's irrigated cotton fields from 676 mu to more than 900 mu (the village has a total of 2,351.7 mu of cotton fields). The village also ordered more than 50 new-style waterwheels (the village originally had 66). They are always ready to fight against drought.

Qu Yaoli goes to the farm every half month to study cotton planting techniques. He often leads the whole team to study and improve farming methods. In order to universally promote scientific cotton planting techniques, he made reports at various county and district meetings and suggested that the village government establish a cotton planting technology research committee, with a cotton planting technology promotion group under it. Everyone elected him as the technical instructor. In the village's 44 mutual aid teams, each team has a "Qu Yaoli cotton planting technology instructor." In addition to systematically teaching technology to each team according to the agricultural activities of each period, Qu Yaoli also often uses field visits to teach everyone to learn new technology to plant cotton. This year, Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team selected two mu of land near the village by the roadside as an experimental field for improving cotton planting techniques. Every time he teaches a technique, he first demonstrates it in this field for everyone to see. After the wheat harvest, when the weather was dry and there was no rain, he called on everyone to irrigate the cotton early and first irrigated the first water in this field. The cotton seedlings that had been irrigated with the first water grew normally, and the cotton seedlings that had not been irrigated did not grow for a long time. The cotton farmers who had not dared to irrigate early saw this fact and also believed that it was better to irrigate early. Some farmers saw Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team irrigating the cotton fields at night, and they also turned on the lights to irrigate at night. When applying top dressing, some cotton farmers did not believe in the method of applying top dressing in stages, and some people found it troublesome and wanted to apply it all at once. In order to correct these wrong ideas and practices, Qu Yaoli selected a few cotton plants and weeds in the two-mu experimental field for experimentation. He applied the fertilizer powder that should have been used in three times to these cotton plants and weeds at one time, and the leaves of the cotton plants and weeds were burned yellow. Many cotton farmers saw this fact and believed in the benefits of applying top dressing in stages.

On June 27th, during the "Patriotic Day," the cadres and cotton farmers in Qu Zhuangtou Village saw that the cotton seedlings in the entire village were indeed growing well, and they proposed to increase the patriotic production increase plan to produce more cotton for the country. Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team increased the original plan of producing 630 jin of seed cotton per mu of cotton field to 651 jin. The secretary of the CCP village branch called on all mutual aid teams and cotton farmers in the village at the "Patriotic Day" meeting to continue to work hard, earnestly learn Qu Yaoli's cotton planting techniques, and strive to make Qu Zhuangtou Village a patriotic high-yield model village.

Why are the production emotions of Qu Yaoli and the members of Qu Yaoli's Mutual Aid Team so high? I remembered the conversation of Qu Yaoli and other labor models at a symposium in Beijing last October. At that time, Li Shunda, Han En, Lu Hongbin and other nationally famous agricultural labor models also participated in the symposium. These four people, except for Qu Yaoli, were all in Beijing for the second time. Their feelings were: "The unity between workers and peasants is getting closer year by year, and the mutual assistance between urban and rural areas is getting closer day by day." Qu Yaoli began to realize that producing more and better cotton is of great help to the country's industrial production, and he also began to realize that the working class and the peasants are a pair of working brothers in building the motherland, and the working class is the leader in creating a new society. Therefore, he said at the time: "We workers and peasants used to be separated by a mountain, but today we are as close as a family. I didn't know the great spirit of the working class in creating wealth for the country and the people in the past, but now I have seen it with my own eyes; when I return to the village, I must lead the cotton farmers and brothers to organize and produce more and better cotton for the country." This speech he gave eight months ago has become the actual action of all their team members and cotton farmers in the village today.

    访曲耀离互助组
    本报记者  鲁生
    “七一”前几天，我访问了全国植棉丰产模范曲耀离和他领导的互助组。我在中午以前到了曲耀离的家里。那时院里寂静无人。院墙上挂着一块小黑板，上面写着曲耀离互助组最近十天的农事活动：
    “（一）全组普遍进行第三次浇田，在十天里完成五次浇棉的任务，整枝打切也要同时完成。
    （二）随时注意防止病虫害，彻底消灭棉蚜，保证棉苗不受丝毫损害。
    （三）回茬的麦田每亩要上两大车粪，在十天里每人先完成回茬一亩的任务。（按：因为从割麦后到这时——六月二十三日——没有下过雨，所以他们计划每人要保证利用一切水源浇地完成回茬一亩的任务。“回茬”就是在收割了的麦田里播种秋禾。）
    （四）全组在三天里把爱国公粮准备好，做到粒粒饱满，斗斗干净。
    （五）全组加强时事政治学习，男女组员每天抽空上民校，五天集体读报一次。”
    据当地干部谈，这块黑板的来历是这样的：曲耀离去年在北京、天津参观工厂时，见到工人每天把主要工作写在黑板上，有计划地进行生产。他认为这个办法很好，今年就提倡在互助组里也实行这办法。
    这时曲耀离的妻子惠忠看正在厨房里做午饭。她说：“现在天旱了。为了使棉苗长得好，就得勤浇勤锄。他们天不明就要上地，早饭午饭都在地里吃，回来还在大天黑。有时浇不完一块田，夜里打着灯还要浇。”一会儿午饭做好了，曲耀离的侄媳秀兰和曲耀离的小孩挑着饭赶着骡子去地里送饭，将近一点钟她们又赶着一匹马回来。惠忠看解释说：“去年棉花丰收了，组里的骡马就增加到六头（原有三头）。今年牲口可以轮流吃草轮流拉水车。牲口歇人不歇。”
    下午我们去看曲耀离互助组的棉田。出村向西南方向望去，一片油绿色的棉田里，到处是穿白色衣服的男女农民。他们有的驾锄耘草，有的弯腰整枝，有的看畦浇棉，大家都在紧张地愉快地劳动着。每一大块棉田里都有一眼水井，牲口在井边不停地拉着水车。
    走了一段，看到一个老汉正在精细地整理棉枝。他在他的棉田里整一会枝，又到附近另一块棉田里去比一比。他比的那一块就是曲耀离互助组的试验田。这块田的棉苗长得特别好。别的棉苗只有七、八寸高，这块棉苗已有一尺多高了，而且叶肥茎壮，色泽深绿。他告我们说：“今年曲耀离为了把他的植棉技术都教给大家，就开辟了这块‘小农场’作试验。今年试验下什么种籽，留多少苗，上多少肥料，才能使产量提高，明年就用这种方法来植棉。”老汉说：“这种办法很好，今年我们都是看着这块田的植棉办法来改进技术的。等到秋后试验好了，明年我们种棉就更有根据了。”
    曲耀离互助组的棉田距村子约有三里远。天快黑了，曲耀离互助组全体组员还在继续紧张地浇棉花。曲耀离和副组长高进东说：“现在天气干旱，浇过头水锄过草，就得浇二水。现在我们全组正在普遍浇三水。我们要做到棉苗在天旱风吹的日子里不受一点损害，为国家生产更多更好的棉花。”
    ×    ×    ×
    曲耀离去年秋天在北京会见了毛主席，参加了中华人民共和国成立二周年纪念典礼，还参观了北京的炼钢厂、机耕农场、纺织工厂和农具工厂。他的政治认识大大提高了一步。他回到村里，就到处宣传：组织起来，互相研究，提高技术；学习工人阶级的集体生产办法，普遍提高棉花的单位面积产量。
    从那时起，人民政府的每一个号召，工人阶级对棉农的每一个希望，曲耀离和他的互助组都带头响应。去年全曲庄头行政村在这个组的影响下，都把棉花轧得完全合规格，全部售储给国家。
    今年春天，他为了在爱国增产竞赛中起带头作用，首先整顿了他领导的互助组。经过全体组员的详细讨论，订出了一九五二年的增产计划，要求全组五十亩水地棉田，每亩平均产籽棉六百三十斤，比去年每亩平均产量四百五十斤提高一百八十斤；其中曲耀离的二十二亩棉田，每亩平均要产籽棉七百八十斤。全组还要在三亩丰产田里创造每亩产一千斤的新纪录。全组订出增产计划后，就和江西省植棉模范吴宣文，河北省植棉模范张德芳两个互助组联名向全国棉农发起挑战竞赛。
    曲耀离互助组的棉田，今年做到了四犁四耙（原计划三犁三耙）耢八遍（原计划耢六遍），还用新式犁深翻了一遍，使土壤细碎绵匀。他们互助组的每亩棉田上了一万斤底肥（羊圈粪），他们还买了两千四百斤油饼和四百七十九斤肥田粉作追肥。全组的二亩试验田和三亩丰产田每亩平均上一万三千斤底肥（原计一万斤），八十斤骨粉（原计十五斤）。还准备用一百二十斤豆饼和肥田粉作追肥。
    今年春天，人民政府号召防旱抗旱。曲耀离互助组首先带头打井挑水浇麦，推动全村掀起了打井运动。很快全村就打了六十七眼新井，使全村水地棉田由六百七十六亩增加到九百多亩（全村共两千三百五十一亩七分棉田）。全村还订购了五十多部新式水车（全村原有六十六部）。随时准备向旱灾作斗争。
    曲耀离每半月到农场去研究一次植棉技术。他经常领导全组研究改进耕作方法。为了普遍推广科学的植棉技术，他到县、区的各种会议上作报告，还建议村政府成立起植棉技术研究委员会，下设植棉技术推广小组。大家公推他做技术指导员。全村四十四个互助组里，每组都有一个“曲耀离植棉技术传授员”。曲耀离除按各个时期的农事活动有计划地到各组传授技术外，还经常运用田间参观的形式，教导大家学会新的技术植棉。曲耀离互助组今年在离村较近的路边选出二亩地作改进植棉技术的试验田。他每传授一次技术，便先在这块田里做出样子来让大家看。麦收后天旱不雨，他一面号召大家提前浇棉，一面先在这块田里浇头水。浇过头水的棉苗生长正常，没有浇水的棉苗迟迟不长。原来不敢早浇的棉农看到这个事实，也相信了还是早浇好。有的农民看到曲耀离互助组夜里浇棉田，也打起灯来在夜里浇。施追肥时，有些棉农不相信分期施追肥的办法，有些人嫌麻烦，想一次施完。曲耀离为了纠正这些错误想法和做法，就在二亩试验田里选出几株棉花和野草做试验。他把应当分三次用的肥田粉，一次给这几株棉花和野草用上，棉花和野草的叶子都被烧黄了。许多棉农看到这种事实，就相信了分期施追肥的好处。
    六月二十七日过“爱国日”时，曲庄头村的干部和棉农看到全村的棉苗的确长得好，纷纷提出增订爱国增产计划，为国家生产更多的棉花。曲耀离互助组把原来每亩棉田产六百三十斤籽棉的计划增加到六百五十一斤。中共村支部书记在“爱国日”的大会上号召全村互助组和棉农继续努力，认真学习曲耀离的植棉技术，为争取曲庄头村成为爱国丰产模范村而奋斗。
    ×    ×    ×
    曲耀离和曲耀离互助组的组员们的生产情绪为什么这样高呢？我想起了去年十月曲耀离等劳动模范在北京一次座谈会上的谈话。当时参加座谈会的还有李顺达、韩恩、吕鸿宾等全国著名的农业劳动模范。这四个人，除了曲耀离以外，其余都是二次来北京。他们的感想是：“工农团结一年比一年紧，城乡互助一天比一天亲。”曲耀离开始认识到生产更多更好的棉花，对国家的工业生产帮助很大，也开始认识到工人阶级和农民是建设祖国的一对劳动兄弟，而工人阶级更是创造新社会的带头人。因此，他当时曾说：“我们工农过去隔着一座山，今天亲如一家人。从前我不知道工人阶级为国家为人民创造财富的伟大精神，现在亲眼看见了；回到村里一定要带领棉农兄弟们组织起来，为国家生产更多更好的棉花。”他八个月前的这段谈话，到今天已经变成他们全体组员和全村棉农们的实际行动了。
