    A Letter to Our Beloved Chairman Mao: Guarantee to Study Culture Well and Become Excellent National Defense Army Soldiers
    Respected Chairman Mao: We want to report a big thing to you. We have come to the Central South Military Region Cadre Cultural Fast Training School to study.

    Chairman Mao: In the old society, we were all children of poor and oppressed farmers. At that time, how could we have imagined being able to go to school and study? Today, we have entered our own school to study, to get rid of the "illiterate" label, how happy we are! Chairman Mao! These are all the fruits of your leadership in our struggle. We sincerely thank you and thank the Party.

    We know that studying culture is a very important task. You said, "An army without culture is a stupid army." Indeed, without culture and scientific knowledge, we cannot master modern weapons, and we cannot adapt to combined arms operations. Then, it will be very difficult for us to build a strong, modern, and regular national defense army. In the past, because we lacked culture, we often encountered many difficulties in our work, which often caused losses that could have been avoided. All of these have made us deeply realize that to be a qualified national defense army soldier, we must study culture well.

    Chairman Mao! We express our determination to you and guarantee to study humbly, attentively, and patiently, respect teachers, obey leadership, abide by school rules, strive to overcome difficulties in learning, and strive to complete our learning tasks. We must win a great victory on the cultural front.
    Bao Renchuan, Tian Guangwen, Li Shuting, Mao Guo, Guo Junqing

    写给敬爱的毛主席  保证学好文化做一个优秀的国防军战士
    敬爱的毛主席：我们要向您报告一件大事情，我们已到中南军区干部文化速成学校来学习了。
    毛主席：我们在旧社会里都是受压迫的穷苦农民的孩子；那时，那想到能上学念书？今天我们进了自己的学校念书，要摘掉“文盲”帽子，我们心里多么高兴啊！毛主席！这都是您领导我们斗争得来的果实，我们衷心感谢您，感谢党。
    我们知道：学习文化是非常重要的任务。您说“没有文化的军队是愚蠢的军队。”的确，没有文化，不懂得科学知识，就不能掌握现代化武器，就不能适应联合兵种作战，那么，我们要建设一支强大的、现代化、正规化的国防军就很困难。过去我们因为缺乏文化，在工作中常常遇到许多困难，常使工作遭到本来可以避免的损失。这些都使我们深深体会到：要做一个够格的国防军战士，就必须学好文化。
    毛主席！我们向您表示决心，保证虚心、专心、耐心地学习，尊重教员，服从领导，遵守校规，努力克服学习中的困难，争取完成学习任务，要在文化战线上打个大胜仗。
