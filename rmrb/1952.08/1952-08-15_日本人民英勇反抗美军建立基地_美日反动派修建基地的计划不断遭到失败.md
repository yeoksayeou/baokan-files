Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The struggle of the Japanese people against turning Japan into a U.S. military base is forcing the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries’ plans to requisition land and build military bases in several areas to repeatedly fail.

    As early as the period of preparing to sign the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement," the U.S. military in Japan had already decided to use Monbetsu Town, on the coast of the Hidaka region in Hokkaido, as a U.S. military training ground. This training ground, including land and sea, covers an area of 3,800 cho, and its establishment will cause a huge loss of more than 250 million yen annually in agriculture and fishery to 2,500 farmers and fishermen. The local people have launched a struggle against the establishment of the U.S. military training ground since February. On June 15th, the townspeople held another meeting, resolving "not to let American soldiers step into Hidaka" and "absolutely oppose the requisition of land according to the Administrative Agreement, completely refuse, and resolutely resist." In order to forcibly implement its plan to turn Monbetsu Town into a training ground, the American occupiers even drove 35-ton tanks into the town, threatening to hold exercises there on June 27th. However, due to the brave and resolute resistance of the residents of Monbetsu Town, the U.S. military was finally forced to cancel the exercise and withdraw from Monbetsu Town. The people of Monbetsu Town also firmly stated that in order to recover Tomihama, another training ground designated by the U.S. military before the conclusion of the "Administrative Agreement," they will continue to struggle.

    The people of Oita Prefecture are also resolutely fighting against the establishment of military bases by the U.S. military. The U.S. military plans to requisition 2,000 cho of land in the three villages of Kuju, Shiratani, and Tono in Naoiri County of the prefecture to establish military bases. On May 16th, the people of the three villages held a meeting, deciding to launch a struggle against the U.S. military's occupation of land, and resolved to protest to the prefectural authorities and the U.S. military headquarters. After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration march in front of the prefectural government. Under the influence of the people's struggle, the local prefectural and village councils also resolved to oppose the U.S. military's requisition of land.

    While fighting against the American occupation forces, Japanese farmers have also launched a struggle against the "Police Reserve Force" forcibly requisitioning land to build military bases. In Kodama County, Saitama Prefecture, farmers had reclaimed part of the local former Japanese military airfield into farmland after the war. After the separate peace treaty came into effect, the "Police Reserve Force" actually notified them that they would take over the old site of the airfield as a base. After receiving this notice, the farmers immediately held a village meeting, deciding to send a delegation to the Saitama Prefectural Government, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the "Police Reserve Force" headquarters to petition, and called on nearby residents to unite and struggle, driving away the "Police Reserve Force" personnel who were sent to survey and cut grass. Under the strong resistance and struggle of the farmers, the "Police Reserve Force" was forced to abandon the plan to requisition the reclaimed land in the old site of the airfield. They sent people to Minamigobara Village in the same county to investigate unreclaimed land, attempting to relocate the base there. However, the "Police Reserve Force" also encountered fierce opposition from the local people in Minamigobara Village. The residents of Minamigobara Village first resolved to oppose the requisition of any land to build military bases, and the people of nearby villages unanimously responded to the resolution of Minamigobara Village, uniting to oppose the requisition of land in any way. This spirit of solidarity and struggle of the farmers forced the "Police Reserve Force" authorities to finally announce the suspension of the requisition of land in the area.

    With the support of their worker brothers, the farmers of Nagano Prefecture, after a fierce struggle, also defeated the conspiracy of the "Police Reserve Force" to encircle the Mihara Ranch in the prefecture to establish a training ground. The workers' and farmers' congresses of Nagano City and Matsumoto City, as well as the prefectural farmers' general mobilization meeting and the prefectural celebration of the "May Day" festival, passed resolutions opposing the requisition of Mihara Ranch and held tough negotiations with the prefectural government and the prefectural assembly. Under the pressure of the people of the prefecture, the agricultural committee of the prefectural assembly finally dared not agree to the demands of the "Police Reserve Force" and recognized the farmers' right to use Mihara Ranch.

    日本人民英勇反抗美军建立基地
    美日反动派修建基地的计划不断遭到失败
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：日本人民反对变日本为美国军事基地的斗争，正迫使美、日反动派在若干地区征用土地建筑军事基地的计划不断遭到失败。
    早在准备签订美日“行政协定”的时期，驻日美军就已决定将北海道日高地方沿海的门别町作为美军的演习场。这个演习场连陆地和海面在内，面积共达三千八百町步，它的设立将使二千五百名农民和渔民每年在农业和渔业上遭受两亿五千万日元以上的巨大损失。当地的人民从二月起就展开了反对美军设立演习场的斗争。六月十五日，町民又举行了一个大会，决议“不让美国大兵走进日高一步”、“绝对反对按行政协定征用土地，全面拒绝，坚决抵抗”。美国占领者为了强行其变门别町为演习场的计划，竟将三十五吨重的坦克开进市镇中，威胁地要在六月二十七日在该地举行演习。但是，由于门别町居民英勇坚决的反抗，终于迫使美军取消了演习，并撤出了门别町。门别町人民并坚决表示：为了收回“行政协定”缔结前美军即已指定的另一演习场富滨，还要继续进行斗争。
    大分县的人民也坚决进行反对美军设立军事基地的斗争。美军计划征用该县直入郡的久住、白丹、都野这三个村镇的二千町步的土地建立军事基地。三个村镇的人民在五月十六日召开了大会，决定展开反对美军侵占土地的斗争，并决议向该县当局和美军司令部提出抗议，会后群众并在县政府前面举行了示威游行。在人民斗争的影响下，当地的县议会和村议会也决议反对美军征用土地。
    日本农民在与美国占领军进行斗争的同时，也展开了反对日本“警察后备队”强征土地建立军事基地的斗争。在埼玉县的儿玉郡，农民在战后曾把当地的前日军飞机场的一部分开垦成了耕地。单独和约生效后，“警察后备队”竟通知要接收飞机场的旧址作为基地。农民们在接到此项通知后，立即举行村民大会，决定派遣代表团往埼玉县县政府、农林省和“警察后备队”总部请愿，并号召附近居民团结起来进行斗争，赶走派来进行测量和割草的“警察后备队”。“警察后备队”在农民们坚强的抵抗和斗争下，被迫放弃了征用飞机场旧址中开垦地的计划，他们另外派人到该郡南共和村去考察未开垦的土地，企图把基地改设在那里。但是，“警察后备队”在南共和村也同样遭到了当地人民的激烈反对。南共和村的居民首先决议反对征用任何土地来建筑军事基地，附近村庄的人民一致响应南共和村的决议，团结在一起反对以任何方式征用土地。农民们这种团结的斗争精神，迫使“警察后备队”当局最后不得不宣布中止征用该地的土地。
    长野县的农民在工人兄弟的支持下，经过激烈的斗争以后，也打败了“警察后备队”企图圈占该县美原牧场设立演习场的阴谋。该县长野市和松本市的工农大会以及县农民总奋起大会和全县庆祝“五一”节大会，纷纷通过决议，反对征用美原牧场，并与县政府和县议会进行了强硬的谈判。县议会农业委员会在全县人民的压力下，终于不敢答应“警察后备队”的要求，承认了农民对于美原牧场的使用权。
