Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 23rd. Harrison now appears not only as a liar, but also as a braggart. At the armistice talks on the 19th, Harrison, contrary to his usual "nothing to say," surprisingly posed as a victor, continuing to boast about his bankrupt so-called "military pressure." Harrison's "victorious" posture, after the United States was forced to sit down for negotiations for more than a year because of its failed war of aggression, seems particularly ridiculous.

What is the "victory" Harrison is boasting about? It is this: the most ferocious American imperialism in the world, at the cost of a large amount of manpower and material resources, has conducted a war of aggression on the small Korean peninsula for more than two years, and as a result, it is still stuck near the 38th parallel, the place where it launched its aggression, and can no longer move forward. On the other hand, the Korean and Chinese People's forces, which Harrison calls "defeated," have become stronger and stronger in the war against aggression, thwarting the American aggressors' plan to enslave the entire Korea and then invade China. They are now standing like mountains in front of the American aggressors, preventing them from crossing the line. Even the American aggressive group has to admit the strength of the Korean and Chinese People's forces. Hudson, who once served as the commander of the U.S. Army's 40th Infantry Division in Korea, said frankly after returning to the United States: "Whenever the Communists decide to attack, they can drive the United Nations forces out of Korea." U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins' remarks in Tokyo on July 15 also show that the only issue the American aggressors are considering now is how to "prevent the United Nations forces in Korea from being annihilated."

At this time when the American aggressors' defeat is already set, the U.S. side still pretends to be a "victor" and tries to scare the Korean and Chinese side with "military pressure." This is obviously deceiving oneself and others, and it is useless. Even the U.S. side itself has no confidence in whether "military pressure" can force the Korean and Chinese side to accept the U.S. side's demand for the forced retention of prisoners of war. The "New York Times" of August 3 said: "Launching a limited offensive against the superior Communist forces could cause significant casualties without achieving significant results." The "Christian Science Monitor" of August 12 was even more pessimistic. It said: "No matter how high the price paid for the Allied offensive on a local scale, it does not seem likely to force concessions at Panmunjom." The American aggressors know that it is as difficult to gain any advantage on the land battlefront as it is at the negotiating table, so they now have to place their only hope on air raids. But the "New York Times" of August 3 admitted that, due to "the few good military targets left in North Korea," "it is doubtful whether air raids alone can force the enemy to make any major concessions." Therefore, the New York Times concluded for the American aggressors themselves: to force the Korean and Chinese side to yield, the U.S. side "apparently has not yet found an effective way to use pressure on the Communist side."

Now it is very clear that the actual result of the U.S. side's so-called "military pressure" is only a sharp increase in U.S. military casualties. In May, 5,361 U.S. troops were wiped out, not much different from the previous months, but when the U.S. side strengthened its military offensive in June, the number of U.S. troops wiped out increased to 11,220, and it reached 8,962 in July. This further exposed the weakness of insufficient U.S. military strength. And in order to put together the badly damaged air force to conduct air raids on North Korea, the United States has had to send aircraft originally intended for Western Europe to Korea.

The more the American aggressors strengthen the so-called "military pressure," the more they trap themselves in the quagmire they created.

### 哈利逊竟继续吹嘘其早已破产的“军事压力”

    哈利逊竟继续吹嘘其早已破产的“军事压力”
    【新华社开城二十三日电】哈利逊现在显出他不仅是一个说谎家，而且是一个吹牛大王。在十九日的停战谈判会议上，哈利逊一反“无话可说”的常例，竟然以胜利者自居，继续吹嘘其早已破产了的所谓“军事压力”。哈利逊这种“胜利者”的姿态，在美国因为侵略战争失败而被迫坐下来进行了一年多谈判以后，看来特别可笑。
    哈利逊所吹嘘的“胜利”是什么呢？这就是：世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义，用大量的人力物力作为代价，在小小的朝鲜半岛上进行了两年多的侵略战争，结果仍然停留在它发动侵略的地点三八线附近，再也无法前进。而被哈利逊称做“失败了”的朝中人民部队方面，却在反侵略战争中愈战愈强，粉碎了美国侵略者奴役全朝鲜，进而侵略中国的计划，现在正屹立如山地站在美国侵略者面前，使它无法越雷池一步。就连美国侵略集团也不得不承认朝中人民部队的强大。曾经在朝鲜担任美军第四十步兵师师长的胡德逊在回到美国以后就率直地说：“共军什么时候决定进攻，就什么时候都能把联合国军队赶出朝鲜。”美国陆军参谋长柯林斯七月十五日在东京发表的谈话，也说明美国侵略者现在唯一考虑的问题，是如何“防止联合国在朝鲜的军队被歼灭”。
    在这美国侵略者的败局已定的时候，美方还伪装
    “胜利者”，企图拿“军事压力”来吓唬朝中方面，显然是欺人自欺，毫无用处的。就是美方自己，对于“军事压力”能否迫使朝中方面接受美方的强迫扣留战俘的要求，也毫无信心。八月三日的“纽约时报”就说：“对优势的共军发动一个有限度的攻势，可能将造成重大的死伤，而得不到显著的结果。”八月十二日的“基督教科学箴言报”说得更悲观。它说：“联军的进攻在局部规模上所付的代价无论多大，也不像会逼得出在板门店的让步来。”美国侵略者自知要在陆地战线上得到什么便宜，也就像在谈判桌上一样困难，因此他们现在只好把唯一的希望寄托在空袭上。但是八月三日的“纽约时报”又承认，由于“北朝鲜所剩的良好的军事目标很少了”，“因此可以怀疑仅空袭一法是否就能够逼迫敌人作任何重大让步”。于是，纽约时报替美国侵略者自己作出了结论：要迫使朝中方面屈服，美方“显然至今还找不到一个对共方使用压力的有效办法”。
    现在已经看得很清楚，美方施行所谓“军事压力”的实际结果，只是美军伤亡的激剧增加。在五月份，美军被歼五千三百六十一人，和以往的几个月差不了多少，而到美方加强军事进攻的六月份，美军被歼的数字就增加到了一万一千二百二十人，七月份也达到八千九百六十二人。这就使美军兵力不足的弱点更加暴露。而为了拼凑损失惨重的空军力量对朝鲜北部进行空袭，美国已不得不将原来预备拨到西欧去的飞机送到朝鲜来。
    美国侵略者越是加强所谓“军事压力”，就越是把他们往他们自己制造的泥淖里陷下去。
