    A Record of the Naval Athletes' Aquatic Sports Performance
    Ding Mang
    On the afternoon of August 2nd, the four banks of Beihai Park in Beijing were densely packed with spectators. Filled with boundless love for the People's Liberation Army, they were waiting to watch the aquatic sports performance by naval athletes.
    In the center of Beihai Park, reflecting the green waves, a small boat carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Light balloons draped in red floated in the air. To the majestic sounds of the "People's Liberation Army March," the performance began.
    Sampans are the light cavalry of the navy. On shallow, sandy shores where warships cannot land, and in choppy anchorages where warships cannot communicate, the sampan plays its unique role. Today, the sampan is dressed in the navy's most solemn festive attire—hung with dazzling full flags, resembling a vast fleet at sea, passing the reviewing stand under the guidance of speedboats. The athletes stood at attention, raising their oars in salute. Next, the sampans performed various formations of a fleet in navigation and combat. The athletes, moving in unison, raised and lowered thirty-six white oars simultaneously, the grayish-blue "fleet" advancing through the waves at a speed of six nautical miles per hour (approximately eighteen li). From this action, as synchronized as a pendulum, the audience saw the collective spirit and skilled rowing techniques of the naval athletes.
    On the pier to the left of the reviewing stand, fully armed naval athletes appeared. Wearing white sailor uniforms and heavy steel helmets, with round-disc submachine guns slung across their backs, they began crossing Beihai Park under the guidance of a red battle flag. The audience watched this orderly armed procession, mentally weighing the weight of the helmets and guns against the width of the water, and the entire venue was silent. On the southeast coast of the motherland, in stormy dusks or foggy dawns, naval soldiers often swim across miles of shoals or canyons like this, appearing on islands battered by waves. Song Renfu, Song Xizeng, Yu Xinyong, and other athletes have all swam thousands of meters in raging waves. Armed swimming is a manifestation of the navy's strong and unyielding will to defend the motherland. As the athletes gradually approached the landing point, the triangular squad formation transformed into a combat team formation. A red flare signaled the order to charge, and they shouted as they charged ashore with their guns. Flags waved, a blaze of red, and cheers shook the entire venue. An ordinary swimmer typically takes eighteen to twenty minutes to swim 800 meters in swimming attire. However, naval athletes, carrying fifteen jin (approximately 7.5 kilograms) of weight, swam 800 meters in just sixteen minutes. The audience unanimously praised the extraordinary technique and physical strength of the naval athletes in long-distance swimming with a load.
    In the sampan race, Sampan No. 5 was in the lead. On this sampan was an athlete named Wang Xinlei, who once fell into the sea while on duty and victoriously fought the wind and waves for an hour and a half.
    After the sampan race, the athletes wearing red swimming caps, formed a triangular formation, swimming from five corners towards the center, forming a red five-pointed star, surrounding the image of the leaders. Amidst cheers, water splashed high, reflecting the sun, a dazzling and eye-catching display of iridescent light. Just as the audience was enthusiastically applauding this scene, white light balloons and doves simultaneously rose from around the leader's image, circling in the wave-rippled sky above Beihai Park. At this moment, from the four banks, from the mountains, from the children climbing the trees and the old men waving banana-leaf fans, a thunderous cheer erupted simultaneously.
    Finally, swimmers wearing red and yellow swimming suits, lined up in a horizontal formation, each team wearing different colored caps, swimming towards the reviewing stand using various styles such as breaststroke, butterfly stroke, sidestroke, and backstroke, surrounding the reviewing stand and cheering once more by splashing water, concluding the performance.
    The aquatic sports performance fully demonstrated the will of our army's aquatic athletes to defend peace, their steadfast and courageous spirit, their extraordinary swimming skills, and their strong physical strength. (Xinhua News Agency)

    记海军运动员的水上体育表演
    丁芒
    八月二日下午，在北京北海的四岸，观众站得密密层层。他们怀着对人民解放军的无限敬爱，等着看海军运动员的水上体育表演。
    在映着绿色波光的北海正中央，小艇载着毛主席和朱总司令的巨像。披着红彩的轻气球在空中随风飘荡。在“解放军进行曲”的雄壮的乐声中，表演开始了。
    舢板是军舰的轻骑兵。在浅水的沙岸，军舰无法登陆时，在风起浪涌的锚地，军舰无法联络时，舢板便发挥了他特有的作用。今天，舢板穿上了海军的最隆重的节日礼服——悬挂着灿烂夺目的满旗，好像海上浩荡的舰队，在汽艇引导下，通过主席台。运动员们都立桨致敬。接着，舢板表演了舰队在航行和战斗中的各种队形。运动员们一俯一仰，三十六根白桨同时扬起，同时着水，青灰色的“舰队”，以每小时六海里（约合十八华里）的速度，破浪前进。观众们从这和钟摆一样整齐合拍的动作中，看出了海军运动员的集体主义精神和熟练的划桨技术。
    在主席台左侧的码头上，出现了全副武装的海军运动员。他们穿着白色的水兵服，戴着沉重的钢盔，横背着圆盘冲锋枪，在一面战斗的红旗的引导下，开始横渡北海。观众注视着这整齐的武装行列，心里都掂量着钢盔和枪的重量与水面的宽阔，全场屏声静气。在祖国东南沿海，在刮着风暴的黄昏或在笼罩着浓雾的黎明，海军战士们常常这样地游过几里长的浅滩或峡谷，出现在浪涛击岸的海岛上。宋仁福、宋锡增、于信涌以及其他运动员，都曾经在惊涛骇浪里游过一万几千公尺。武装游泳正是海军保卫祖国的坚强不屈的意志的表现。当运动员们逐渐接近登陆点，班三角队形变成战斗小组队形。一颗红色信号弹发出冲锋的号令，他们呼喊着端着枪冲上岸。旗帜挥动，一片红光，欢呼声震动全场。一个普通的游泳员，穿着游泳衣游八百公尺，一般也得费十八至二十分钟。而海军运动员们载着十五斤重量，游八百公尺，只费了十六分钟。观众们一致赞扬海军运动员负重长途游泳的非凡技术和体力。
    舢板竞赛中，五号舢板驶在最前面。这艘舢板上有一个名叫王鑫垒的运动员，曾经在执行任务时掉在海里，胜利地与风浪搏斗过一个半小时。
    舢板竞赛以后，戴着红色游泳帽的运动员们，排成三角队形，分别从五个角向中心游去，组成了一个红五角星，环护着领袖像。在欢呼声中，水花高高溅起，映照着太阳，一片琉璃的光彩耀人眼目。观众们正为这景象热烈鼓掌时，从领袖像四周，白色的轻气球和鸽子同时飞起，在波光摇漾的北海的上空回旋。这时，从四岸，从山上，从爬在树上的儿童和挥着芭蕉扇的老人的口里，同时爆发了雷鸣似的欢呼。
    最后，穿着红黄两色游泳衣的游泳员们，排成横队，各队戴着不同颜色的帽子，分别用蛙式、蝶式、侧泳、仰泳等各种姿势，向主席台游去，围着主席台再一次打水欢呼，结束了表演。
    水上体育表演，充分表现了我军水上运动员保卫和平的意志，坚毅勇敢的精神，非凡的游泳技术与坚强的体力。（新华社）
