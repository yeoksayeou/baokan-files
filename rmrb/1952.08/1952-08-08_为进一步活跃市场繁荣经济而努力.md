    Strive to Further Activate the Market and Prosper the Economy
    Director of the Trade Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council, Li Zheren

    Since the North China Economic Conference in March, the North China market has been improving daily. The reason for the improvement is primarily the development of materials exchange work. In April and May, we held the North China Regional Materials Exchange Conference in Tianjin, with a total transaction value of over 745.4 billion yuan; we participated in the East China Regional Materials Exchange Conference, with a total transaction value of over 169.8 billion yuan. In addition, we participated in the Central South Regional and are participating in the Southwest Regional Materials Exchange Conferences. At the same time, provinces, cities, special districts, counties, and towns widely organized various forms of small-scale materials exchange fairs (temple fairs, medicinal herb fairs, mule and horse fairs, general merchandise fairs, etc.), developing short-distance, mass-based materials exchange. According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of June, over 1,200 small-scale materials exchange fairs were held throughout the North China region this year, with a total transaction value of over one trillion yuan. Through the above efforts, plus the fact that 90 percent of the 1.6 trillion yuan contracts signed at the North China Regional Materials Exchange Exhibition last autumn have been fulfilled, the entire North China region's local products have been sold out, and some stockpiled industrial products have been sold. Secondly, the gradual restoration and increase of processing orders, purchases, and loans have supported industrial production and resolved many operational difficulties for private industrialists and merchants. For example, the total value of processing orders in Beijing in the first half of this year increased by 114 percent compared to the same period last year, and the quantity of major commodities processed in the second quarter increased by more than 70 percent compared to the first quarter, thereby driving the production of more than 30 industries, including private dyeing and weaving, knitting, and chemicals, involving more than 3,000 factories and nearly 20,000 workers. In terms of purchasing industrial products, Tianjin Trust Company alone purchased over 452.8 billion yuan worth of goods from private industrialists and merchants from February to June, accounting for 67.8 percent of the company's total purchases during these five months. In terms of loans, the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China provided loans of 451.3 billion yuan to private industrialists and merchants from June 1st to July 24th, supporting approximately 20,000 industrial and commercial households. Thirdly, a large amount of production materials were supplied to farmers, supporting agricultural production. As of July 10th, over 708.77 million catties of various fertilizers had been sold throughout the region, equivalent to 142 percent of the total supply for the entire year last year. In the first half of the year, approximately 30,000 new-style walking plows were supplied to farmers throughout the region, equivalent to 164 percent of the total supply for the entire year last year; 92,916 waterwheels, equivalent to 128 percent of the total supply for the entire year last year; 60,000 sprayers, equivalent to 90 percent of the total supply for the entire year last year; 8.69 million catties of cottonseed oil soap, equivalent to 835 percent of the total supply for the entire year last year. In addition, according to statistics from the first quarter alone, more than 134,000 pieces of old-fashioned agricultural tools, as well as a large number of livestock and seeds, were supplied. The sales volume of some industrial products in the first half of the year also increased compared to the same period last year. For example, taking the sales volume in the first half of last year as 100, in Hebei Province: general merchandise was 152, cotton cloth was 144.88; in Shanxi Province: general merchandise was 308, cotton cloth was 267.72. Fourthly, as of mid-July, the region had completed 102 percent of the cotton purchase plan for January to August; as of early July, the pre-purchase of cotton had completed 87 percent of the plan. In short, through the above efforts, the North China market has become increasingly active.

    However, the stockpiling of industrial products in cities and industrial and mining enterprises in North China is still serious, while there is a shortage of industrial products in rural areas. At many small-scale materials exchange fairs in various places, industrial products suitable for rural needs are in short supply. If this situation is not rapidly and thoroughly changed, it will be detrimental to the development of the patriotic production increase and economy movement in industry and agriculture, and to national fiscal revenue. Therefore, activating materials exchange and promoting industrial products have become central issues that must be resolved in current economic work.

    The reasons for the current stockpiling of industrial products, on the state-owned trade departments and cooperatives' side, besides the fact that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns have just ended and all forces only recently turned to business, are mainly: many staff members of state-owned trade and cooperatives still have remnants of capitalist business ideology and bureaucratic work style, which hinders the development and improvement of current trade work. They have a simple profit-seeking viewpoint, blindly pursue the market, and have no idea of the goods in stock. Some state-owned trade units and state-owned industrial and mining enterprises have departmentalism views. For the benefit of their own units, they even deceive and trick each other, do not disclose real costs, and even have so-called "confidential figures" and "hidden profits," which increases the cost of goods and hinders large-scale sales. Secondly, state-owned trade does not rely enough on cooperatives to promote industrial products. Thirdly, a small number of trade staff, after the "Three-Anti" campaign, developed the erroneous sentiment of not wanting to deal with capitalists, which also affected the development of business. In addition, in the private industrial and commercial sector, a few people still lack a correct understanding of the policies of the People's Government, are worried, and their enthusiasm for business has not been fully restored.

    However, a further active situation in the North China market will soon arrive because: 1. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns eliminated the "three evils" and "five poisons," creating extremely favorable conditions for the development of the national economy and legitimate private industry and commerce. Because North China's industrial and agricultural production has reached and exceeded the level before the Anti-Japanese War, with the development of production, the sale of large quantities of local products, the adjustment of wages, the implementation of the subsidy system, the fall in prices, and the increase in state investment, people's purchasing power is increasing day by day, and the market for industrial products has expanded compared to before. In addition, with the bumper harvest of summer wheat and the promising autumn harvest, the peak season is coming. Based on these basic favorable conditions, we estimate that after the efforts of August, a new prosperous situation will appear in the North China market in September and October. This is certain and without doubt.

    Regarding the fundamental way to further activate the market and prosper the economy, we believe that we must first earnestly implement and execute the spirit of Director Chen Yun's report at the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. This report is a concretization of the economic policies of the Common Program under the current circumstances and is necessary for strengthening unity, production, and economic prosperity after the "Five-Anti" campaign. Therefore, the financial and economic departments of the people's governments of each province and city should convene professional meetings separately to specifically resolve the main problems raised by private industrialists and merchants in various places, in order to give play to their enthusiasm for production and business. Regarding this issue, major cities in North China have already done a lot of work, but it is not enough, and it should be continued to be resolved based on the principles of Director Chen Yun's report.

    In order to implement Director Chen Yun's report, it is also necessary, on the basis of cherishing the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres, activists, and workers, and consolidating the leadership of the working class, to correctly resolve the ideological problem of some trade cadres not wanting to deal with the bourgeoisie. This is so that they can both draw a clear ideological line with the capitalists, stand firm, grasp policies, and be vigilant against the capitalists committing the "five poisons" again, and also, from actively dealing with the capitalists, unite and promote the capitalists to actively engage in legitimate industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

    Second, it is imperative to vigorously launch a movement to promote the sale of industrial products. The sales task of industrial products in North China in the second half of this year is very large. Taking the actual performance in the second half of last year as 100, the sales plan for the second half of this year is: cotton yarn 133, cotton cloth 134, coal 141, general merchandise 160. Summer goods are required to be sold out in the third quarter. This requires resolutely implementing the instructions of the Central Trade Department on promoting industrial products and earnestly implementing the policy of wholesale as the main focus. The targets of wholesale are cooperatives, government agencies, troops, organizations, factories, schools, and private peddlers. At present, some units and cadres have the monopolistic idea of not wanting to wholesale to private merchants and peddlers. They do not understand that only by organizing all forces can large quantities of industrial products be sent to all levels of the market, especially the rural market, for the vast number of consumers, especially farmers, to choose and purchase. In rural areas, according to the needs of farmers in various places, a method of limited-term consignment sales without returns can be adopted for cooperatives, that is, cooperatives first take goods from state-owned companies, sell the goods within a limited time and then pay. If the goods are not sold out after the deadline, the remaining goods will be purchased by the cooperative. This can both solve the problem of insufficient funds for cooperatives and sell a large number of stockpiled industrial products. The length of the consignment sales period can be determined according to the speed of turnover of different commodities. The period for faster turnover can be shorter, and the period for slower turnover (such as coal) can be longer (two or three months); however, the cooperative must earnestly guarantee to settle accounts and pay on time. In cities, bicycles, radios, cigarettes, matches, and goods that cannot be sold after the summer can be sold on credit to organized consumers (cooperatives, government agencies, organizations, troops, workers, students); however, the agency must guarantee to deduct payments in installments and settle accounts on time. In order to prevent malpractices, it must be stipulated that: hot-selling goods are not allowed to be sold on credit, private merchants and unorganized consumers are not allowed to be sold on credit, and the types of goods sold on credit are not allowed to be increased without authorization. Regardless of whether it is a credit sale or consignment sale, it is a temporary measure, and it should be stopped once the market situation is completely active. In the movement to promote industrial products, it is also necessary to especially emphasize the rapid and thorough investigation of warehouses, the sorting of commodities, the inspection of prices, and the public disclosure of costs to the local financial and economic committee. Existing goods should be sorted into summer goods, fast-selling goods, slow-selling goods, and defective goods, and wholesale and retail prices and regional price differences should be adjusted according to market supply and demand and the principle of benefiting production, transportation, and sales. For goods with excessively high prices and excessive profits, prices must be appropriately reduced, and "sorting (goods), setting (prices), and selling (goods)" must be done simultaneously. Summer goods should be rapidly and vigorously sold out. Fast-selling goods should be prepared in large quantities, transferred in a timely manner, and supplied sufficiently. It is not allowed for the phenomenon of warehouse stockpiling and out-of-stock at the storefront or the disconnection of brand and market prices to occur. Defective and substandard goods should be devalued according to quality. Provinces and cities can hold exhibitions of stockpiled commodities to display the stockpiled commodities for customers to choose and salespersons to promote. This thorough investigation of warehouses and sorting of commodities is an important step to overcome blind management, strengthen planned management, accelerate capital turnover, improve management, and vigorously promote industrial products. Therefore, the top leaders must be responsible, personally take action, and earnestly and comprehensively do this work.

    Third, it is necessary to complete the task of purchasing agricultural, sideline, local, and special products. Cooperatives and private merchants should also vigorously organize the sale of small-scale local products in order to continue to increase farmers' purchasing power and open up a broad market for industrial products. The North China plan for purchasing grain in the second half of the year is 165 percent of the actual performance in the same period last year. On the one hand, North China lacks grain, and on the other hand, some areas (Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shanxi, and parts of Pingyuan) have surplus grain after the bumper harvest. Therefore, in addition to actively completing the task of purchasing grain, it is also necessary to do a good job in the intra-regional grain allocation. As of July 15th, the purchase of wheat has completed 26.6 percent of the plan. In the future, the policy of relying on cooperatives and implementing price policies based on quality should be continued. Cotton purchase is the central task of the autumn purchase work. The cotton purchase plan from September to December this year is 169 percent of the actual purchase in the same period last year, and all will be contracted by cooperatives. The main links in cotton purchase, in addition to deeply carrying out the patriotic cotton sales and storage movement, doing a good job in recovering pre-purchased cotton, fully supplying materials, and maintaining stable cotton prices, also need to solve the problem of supplying cotton batting and cotton for local spinning, and appropriately manage cotton peddlers. State-owned trade and cooperatives have a large plan to purchase local products in the second half of the year, some of which will be exported to the Soviet Union and Eastern European new democratic countries. After a large number of local products are exported, we can exchange them for the machinery needed for our industrial construction from the Soviet Union and Eastern European new democratic countries. This is of extremely important significance to our country's economic construction. Therefore, companies and cooperatives at all levels in North China should strictly complete the task of purchasing local products according to the time, quantity, and specifications stipulated in the contract.

    In order to further organize material exchanges in a planned way, we plan to hold a regional material exchange conference this autumn. Provinces and cities can also convene separately. Small-scale material exchange fairs below the provincial level should be widely promoted in order to sell scattered, diverse, and small local products that are closely related to the interests of the vast number of farmers, and to supply farmers with daily necessities, industrial products, and handicrafts.

    In order to complete the above tasks, we have launched a patriotic production increase and economy competition movement in state-owned trade and cooperatives throughout North China, in order to give play to the positive factors of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, promote the wisdom, ability, and enterprising spirit of all employees, carry out major improvements in trade and cooperation business, and support the patriotic production increase and economy movement in industry and agriculture. The state-owned trade system in the entire region plans to reduce commodity circulation costs by 520 billion yuan, and cooperatives plan to increase production and economize by 1,343 billion yuan. The central content of the competition is to complete and strive to exceed purchase and sales plans, accelerate capital turnover, reduce commodity circulation costs, improve storage and transportation management, reduce damage and consumption, and reduce costs. To this end, it is necessary to: (1) Mobilize and rely on employees to conduct asset inventory and verification, thoroughly investigate warehouses, sort commodities, and inspect prices. (2) Carry out rationalization proposals, promote advanced experience, improve business techniques, and improve work efficiency. (3) Examine and criticize capitalist business ideology and business methods such as simple profit-seeking viewpoints, departmentalism, and blindly pursuing the market; strengthen political leadership, strengthen the planning and organization of business, overcome blindness, in order to realize socialist business methods. (4) State-owned enterprises and cooperatives must resolutely implement the regulations of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council on publicly disclosing costs to the local financial and economic committee before August 15th, completely eliminate the "business secrets" of the capitalist nature of state-owned enterprises and cooperatives; those who fail to disclose costs or falsely report costs by the deadline shall be punished. State-owned trade must further implement the policy of relying on and supporting cooperatives, cooperatives must first complete the tasks entrusted by the state, and then meet the needs of members, and must strengthen their sense of responsibility and prepare to fulfill the contract provisions. (5) In order to strengthen contact with relevant departments in the competition, the successful experience of Baoding City's state-owned trade companies, cooperatives, banks, and transportation departments signing mutual support competition agreements can be promoted. (6) Establish the business ideology and business style of state-owned trade and cooperative staff to serve the people, serve production, abide by policies and laws, strictly abide by contract credit, ensure genuine goods at fair prices, and facilitate the masses, and appropriately improve employee welfare.

    In implementing the above tasks, special attention should be paid to extensive publicity, following the mass line, using brains, using minds, finding tricks, etc., and timely promoting advanced experience, completely acting in accordance with trade laws and trade policies, improving the quality of work, in order to meet the arrival of the great, planned, large-scale economic construction.

    为进一步活跃市场繁荣经济而努力
    政务院华北行政委员会贸易局局长  李哲人
    三月华北经济会议以来，华北市场已日趋好转。好转的原因，首先是开展了物资交流工作。四五月间，我们在天津举办了华北区物资交流大会，成交总额达七千四百五十四亿余元；参加了华东区物资交流大会，成交总额达一千六百九十八亿余元，此外，还参加了中南区和正在参加着西南区的物资交流会。同时，各省、市、专区和县镇广泛地组织了各种形式的小型物资交流会（庙会、药材大会、骡马大会、百货大会等），开展了短距离的群众性的物资交流。据不完全统计，截至六月底，今年华北全区共举办小型物资交流会达一千二百余次，成交总值约一万亿元以上。经过以上努力，加上去秋华北区物资交流展览会上所订一万六千亿元的合同百分之九十已经兑现，因而华北全区土产已经销完，并推销了一部分积压的工业品。其次，逐步恢复与增加了加工订货、收购和贷款等业务，支持了工业生产，并解决了私营工商业者经营上的不少困难。例如北京市今年上半年加工订货总值较去年同期增加了百分之一百一十四，第二季度主要商品的加工数量比第一季度增加了百分之七十强，从而带动了私营染织、针织、化工等三十多种行业，包括三千多家工厂和近二万职工的生产。在收购工业品方面，仅天津市信托公司一家，从二月到六月收购私营工商业的商品就达四千五百二十多亿元，占该公司这五个月的收购总额的百分之六十七点八。在贷款方面，人民银行天津分行自六月一日至七月二十四日对私营工商业户放款达四千五百一十三亿元，得到扶持的工商户约二万户。第三、供应了农民大量的生产资料，支持了农业生产。截至七月十日止，全区各种肥料已销出七亿零八千七百多万斤，相当于去年全年供应数百分之一百四十二。上半年全区已供应农民新式步犁约三万部，相当于去年全年供应数的百分之一百六十四；水车九万二千九百一十六架，相当于去年全年供应数的百分之一百二十八；喷雾器六万架，相当于去年全年供应数的百分之九十；棉油皂八百六十九万斤，相当于去年全年供应数的百分之八百三十五；此外，仅据第一季度统计，并供应了旧式农具十三万四千多件，及大批牲畜、种籽。上半年部分工业品的推销额，比去年同期也有增加。如以去年上半年推销额为一百，河北省：百货为一百五十二，棉布一百四十四点八八；山西省：百货为三百零八，棉布为二百六十七点七二。第四、截至七月中旬，全区收购棉花已完成一至八月份计划的百分之一百零二；截至七月上旬，预购棉花已完成计划百分之八十七。总之，经过以上努力，华北市场已日趋活跃。
    但目前华北城市与厂矿工业品的积压，仍然是严重的，而农村则感工业品缺乏。在各地不少的小型物资交流会上，凡适合农村需要的工业品都呈现供不应求的现象。这种情况，如不迅速彻底改变，对工农业爱国增产节约运动的开展和国家财政收入，都是不利的。因此，活跃物资交流，推销工业品，就成为当前经济工作中必须解决的中心问题。
    目前工业品积压的原因，在国营贸易部门和合作社方面，除了因为“三反”“五反”刚结束，全部力量不久前才转向业务外，主要原因是：国营贸易与合作社的不少工作人员尚残存着资本主义经营思想与官僚主义作风，这种思想作风阻碍着当前贸易工作的开展和改进。他们存有单纯利润观点，盲目追逐市场，对库存商品心中无数。有些国营贸易单位与国营厂矿之间，相互存有本位主义观点。他们为了本单位利益，竟然尔虞我诈相互捉弄，不公开真实成本，甚至有所谓“保密数字”和“暗藏利润”，以致商品成本加大，妨碍大量卖出。其次是国营贸易依靠合作社去推销工业品不够。第三，少数贸易工作人员，在“三反”后产生了不愿和资本家打交道的错误情绪，也影响了业务的开展。此外，在私营工商业方面，有少数人仍对人民政府政策缺乏正确认识，心存顾虑，经营积极性尚未完全恢复起来。
    但华北市场进一步的活跃局面很快即会到来，因为：一、“三反”“五反”清除了“三害”和“五毒”，给国家经济和正当私营工商业的发展，创造了极有利的条件。由于华北工农业生产已达到和超过抗日战争前的水平，随着生产发展，大量土产推销、工资调整、补贴制的实行，物价下落及国家投资增多，人民购买力日益提高，工业品市场已较前扩大，加之夏麦丰收，秋收有望，旺季即将到来。基于这些基本的有利条件，我们估计：经过八月份的努力，九、十两月华北市场就会出现新的繁荣局面，这是定而无疑的。
    进一步活跃市场繁荣经济的根本办法，我们认为首先必须认真贯彻、执行陈云主任在中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上的报告的精神。这个报告，是共同纲领的经济政策在目前情况下的具体化，是“五反”后加强团结生产和繁荣经济所必需。因此，各省市人民政府财经部门，均应分别召开专业会议，具体地解决各地私营工商业者所提出的主要问题，以发挥他们生产和经营的积极性。关于这个问题，华北各大中城市已经进行不少工作，但还不够，还应本着陈云主任的报告原则，继续加以解决。
    为了贯彻陈云主任的报告，还必须在爱护干部积极分子和职工的革命热情以及巩固工人阶级领导的基础上，正确解决某些贸易干部不愿和资产阶级打交道的思想问题。使他们既能与资本家划清思想界限，站稳立场，掌握政策并警惕资本家再犯“五毒”，又能从积极与资本家打交道中，来团结、推动资本家积极经营有利于国计民生的正当工商业。
    第二、必须大力开展推销工业品运动。今年下半年华北工业品销售任务是很大的。如以去年下半年实绩为一百，今年下半年销售计划为：棉纱一百三十三、棉布一百三十四、煤炭一百四十一、百货一百六十。夏令货要求在第三季度全部销完。这就必须坚决贯彻中央贸易部关于推销工业品的指示和认真地执行以批发为主的方针。批发的对象是合作社、机关、部队、团体、工厂、学校和私商小贩。目前有些单位和干部中有不愿批发给私商、小贩的包办思想，他们不了解只有组织了各方面的力量才能把大批的工业品送到各级市场，特别是农村市场，以供广大消费者特别是农民选购。在农村中可根据各地农民需要，对合作社采取限期代销不退货的办法，即合作社先向国营公司取货，限期卖货后交款。如过期卖不完，所余货物就由合作社购买。这样既可解决合作社资金不足的困难，又可把积存的工业品大批卖出。代销期限的长短，可按不同商品周转快慢而定。周转快者期限可短些，周转慢者（如煤）期限可长些（两月或三月）；但合作社必须切实保证按期结账付款。在城市中，可赊销给有组织的消费者（合作社、机关、团体、部队、工人、学生）以自行车、收音机、纸烟、火柴和一过夏季便不能推销的商品；但须由机关保证，分期扣款，按时结账。为了防止弊端，必须规定：不许赊销热货，不许赊给私商和无组织的消费者，不许擅自增加赊销商品种类。无论赊销或代销，都是临时办法，俟市场情况完全活跃后，即应停止采用。在推销工业品运动中，还必须特别强调迅速彻查仓库，商品站队，检查价格，向当地财委公开成本。要将现存货分别排成夏季货、顺销货、滞销货、残次货，并根据市场供求情况和产、运、销三方面有利的原则，调整批发与零售价格及地区差价。对价格过高利润过大的商品，必须适当降价，并要“边排（队）、边定（价）、边销”。对夏季货应迅速大力推销出去。对顺销货要大量准备、及时调拨、充分供应。不允许发生仓库积压而门市脱销或牌、市价脱节的现象。对残、次货应按质贬价。各省市可以举办库存商品展览会，把积压的商品展览出来，以供顾主选择与售货员推销。这一彻查仓库商品排队的工作，是克服盲目经营、加强计划经营、加速资金周转、改善管理及大力推销工业品的重要步骤，所以必须首长负责，亲自动手，认真地全面地作好这
    一工作。
    第三、必须完成收购农、副、土、特产品的任务，合作社及私商并要用力组织小型土产的推销，以便继续提高农民购买力，为工业品开辟广阔市场。华北下半年收购粮食计划为去年同期实绩的百分之一百六十五。华北一方面缺粮，一方面有些地区（察哈尔、绥远、河北、山西、平原部分地区）丰收后又有余粮，所以除积极完成收购粮食任务外，并须作好区内粮食调剂工作。小麦收购，截至七月十五日已完成计划百分之二十六点六。今后应继续贯彻依靠合作社的方针和执行依质论价的价格政策。收购棉花是秋后收购工作的中心。今年九月至十二月收棉计划为去年同期实购的百分之一百六十九，全部归合作社包收。收购棉花的主要环节，除深入开展爱国售棉储棉运动，作好收回预购棉花工作，充分供应物资，保持棉价稳定外，还须解决絮棉供应和土纺用棉问题，并适当对棉贩加以管理。国营贸易和合作社下半年收购土产计划很大，其中一部分将输向苏联和东欧新民主主义国家。大批土产输出后，就可以从苏联和东欧新民主主义国家换回我们工业建设上所需要的机器，这对我们祖国经济建设有极重要的意义，因此，华北各级公司和合作社均应严格按合同规定的时间、数量、规格，完成土产收购任务。
    为了进一步有计划地组织物资交流，我们打算在今年秋季举行一次全区性的物资交流大会。各省市也可分别召开。省以下的小型物资交流会应广泛提倡，以推销零散的、种类繁多的、与广大农民利益有密切关系的小土产，并供应农民以日用必需的工业品和手工业品。
    为了完成以上各项工作，我们已在华北全区国营贸易与合作社展开了爱国增产节约竞赛运动，以发挥“三反”“五反”运动的积极因素，发扬全体职工的智慧、能力和进取心，进行贸易、合作业务的大改进，并支持工农业的爱国增产节约运动。全区国营贸易系统计划降低商品流通费用五千二百亿元，合作社增产节约一万三千四百三十亿元。竞赛的中心内容是完成并争取超过购销计划，加速资金周转，降低商品流通费用，改善储运保管，减少伤耗，降低成本。为此，必须：（一）发动和依靠职工进行清产核资，彻查仓库，商品排队，检查价格。（二）开展合理化建议，推广先进经验，改进经营技术，提高工作效率。（三）检查与批判单纯营利观点、本位主义和盲目追逐市场等资本主义经营思想与经营方式；加强政治领导，加强业务的计划性和组织性，克服盲目性，以实现社会主义的经营方法。（四）国营企业和合作社必须坚决贯彻政务院华北行政委员会关于八月十五日前向当地财委公开成本的规定，彻底取消国营企业与合作社的资本主义性质的“营业秘密”，如过期不公开成本或假报成本，应受处分。国营贸易要进一步贯彻依靠与扶助合作社的方针，合作社要首先完成国家委托的任务，然后满足社员需要，并要加强责任心，准备实现合同规定。（五）为了在竞赛中加强与各有关部门的联系，可推广保定市各国营贸易公司与合作社、银行及运输部门签订相互支持竞赛的协议书的成功经验。（六）树立国营贸易与合作社工作人员为人民服务、为生产服务、遵守政策法令、严守合同信用与货真价实，便利群众的经营思想与经营作风，并适当提高职工福利。
    在执行上述各项任务中，特别要注意广泛宣传，走群众路线、动脑筋、用心思、找窍门等以及及时推广先进经验，完全按照贸易规律和贸易政策去办事，提高工作质量，以便迎接伟大的、有计划的、大规模的经济建设的到来。
