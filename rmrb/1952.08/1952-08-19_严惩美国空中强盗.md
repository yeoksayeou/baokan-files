Severely Punish American Air Pirates
Chen Bing

On June 25th, an anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, guarding a bridge in the upper reaches of the North Han River, thwarted the attacks of five waves of enemy aircraft totaling forty-eight sorties within two hours, creating a glorious record of shooting down and damaging eight enemy aircraft in a single battle.

At 1:15 PM, two large formations of enemy aircraft appeared in the clouds from direction number four. The sound of their engines grew louder, breaking the rare silence of the Korean front.

The battle alarm sounded on the position. Gunners leaped out of their rest areas and immediately went to their combat posts. Rangefinder operators accurately reported the enemy aircraft's altitude; the gun barrels rotated flexibly with the high-altitude enemy planes.

At an altitude of three thousand meters, four enemy planes, formed in a column, began to dive; their target was a location in direction number fourteen.

"Fight resolutely, comrades! Today is the second anniversary of the Korean war against aggression. We must strive to shoot down enemy planes and avenge the Korean people!"

"The opportunity to make merit has come, comrades! Aim and strike hard!"

The soldiers encouraged each other.

The enemy planes dove down, one close behind the other. Strings of rockets with fiery tails poured down, and batches of bombs and napalm bombs kicked up huge pillars of smoke. A booming echo resounded from the distant valley.

"Aim at the lead plane! Fire! Fire! Fire!" A barrage of shells, spewing flames, roared out; our anti-aircraft machine guns also spat out streams of fire.

A metallic cracking sound rang out in the air. At an altitude of sixteen hundred meters, a shell hit the belly of an enemy plane; the enemy plane shook its wings, flashed with fire, and crashed in a fiery trail onto a ridge, burning up.

At the same time, a black dot tumbled in the air. Several minutes later, a red and white parachute fluttered in the wind. The enemy pilot had bailed out.

"Capture the prisoner!" Scout and Communist Party member Ji Zhenqing, and telephone squad leader and Communist Party member Jia Fu'en shouted as they slung their rifles over their backs and ran toward the hillside where the enemy pilot had landed. Telephone squad deputy leader and Communist Party member Yang Yanxiao had been bedridden with illness for over a month, but as soon as he heard about capturing the prisoner, he immediately got out of bed, grabbed his gun, and limped toward the hillside still under enemy strafing fire.

From the enemy aircraft circling high in the clouds, four more planes dived down. Like hungry wolves, they spat fire, strafing the mountain gully, and coordinating with the first wave of enemy aircraft, they used machine guns and rockets to block every path from the foot of the mountain to the ridge, attempting to hinder our soldiers climbing the cliffs to capture the prisoner.

The enemy planes crisscrossed, strafing. A fragmentation shell exploded a dozen meters away from the third artillery position, and a flat piece of shrapnel wounded Comrade Zhu Jie, the third gunner, in the lower abdomen. The third gun also malfunctioned and could not fire. At that moment, Instructor Qiao Hengbin appeared through the smoke in front of the third gun. The soldiers were very excited and made a solemn guarantee to the instructor: "Please rest assured, Instructor! We will definitely maintain and carry forward our heroic and tenacious fighting style, and we will avenge the fallen Korean comrades and our glorious Comrade Zhu Jie who was wounded! We guarantee to repair the gun within ten minutes and strive to shoot down a second enemy plane!"

"Fight well! Hit them hard! The opportunity to make merit has come, comrades!"

"We will not only maintain the honor of being a collective Third-Class Meritorious Unit for the entire battalion, but also strive to add merit upon merit, become a collective First-Class Meritorious Unit, and strive for each of us to wear a medal on our chest!"

Fourth gun commander, Communist Party member and Second-Class Meritorious Hero He Fenglin, and second gun commander, Communist Party member Li Bin, both proactively directed their anti-aircraft guns, using a fierce net of fire to cover the comrades of the third gun while they carried out front-line repairs.

Twenty minutes later, before the third wave of enemy aircraft had flown away, the fourth wave of four "Mustangs" came with a helicopter. The enemy helicopter flew low, circling, grazing the treetops on the hilltop. Suddenly, two red signal flares rose from the pine forest. When Comrades Ji Zhenqing, Jia Fu'en, and others charged through the layers of fire and approached the hilltop, they saw the helicopter lower a rope ladder and rescue the enemy pilot who had bailed out and landed.

Just as the third wave of enemy aircraft was covering the retreat of three damaged enemy planes in a panic, four "Mustangs" used a "scissor" formation to dive straight into our position, hoping to disperse our concentrated firepower and cover the helicopter's ascent and escape.

"Aim at the helicopter! Fire! Fire! Fire! Hit it hard!" Another storm of shells roared out of the gun barrels. Instantly, white puffs of smoke formed around the enemy helicopter. Our machine guns on the hillside were also roaring.

"Stay calm, aim at the reticle, align the scale, and hit it hard! Comrades, strive to shoot down the helicopter and bring honor to the entire battalion!" Anti-aircraft machine gun platoon leader and Communist Party member Duan Yingtang personally ran to first gunner and Communist Party member Li Zhongxiao to encourage him. Li Zhongxiao replied solemnly, "Please rest assured, Platoon Leader! As long as we have people and guns, we guarantee to shoot down the helicopter, maintain the honor of our battalion as a Third-Class Meritorious Unit, and will never let American air pirates run rampant." Third gunner and Youth League member Gong Wenxiang proactively corrected the speed and elevation angle, and second gunner and Communist Party member Chen Tingzhong also tightly focused the crosshairs of the sight on the big belly of the helicopter. "Thump thump thump thump thump!" They fired a rapid burst. The helicopter, which had just reached an altitude of seven hundred meters, burst into flames, reared up with a long black tail, and crashed straight into a wheat field a thousand meters away from the position. Two enemy pilots who bailed out died, and one pilot was captured by a neighboring unit.

A silver-gray "Mustang" recklessly increased its throttle and dived down. The gunners said, "Come on! Even if dozens more come down, we'll smash you to pieces!" Before this diving enemy plane had time to fire, it was hit in the belly by three of our shells and exploded. Flashing with several balls of fire, it crashed into a small grove of trees, trailing a plume of smoke. The wreckage of this enemy plane was only six hundred meters away from the helicopter's remains.

Our army's accurate and fierce shooting forced the last wave of enemy aircraft, carrying two wounded "Mustangs," to rise to an altitude of five thousand meters in terror and flee.

A burst of victorious cheers rang out on the position. A fierce battle lasting two hours had thus ended victoriously.

On the banks of the rolling North Han River, three pillars of smoke from raging fires rose. In the ashes of piles of broken lead and aluminum, lay the charred remains of enemy aircraft riddled with bullet holes; on the beach twenty meters away, lay the curled and charred bodies of three American pilots.

The next day, the commendation order that spread throughout the army read:

"... On June 25th, the enemy attempted to destroy our bridge in a certain location, concentrating a large number of aircraft to strafe and bomb. All the brave warriors of a certain anti-aircraft artillery battalion guarding the bridge, with resourceful and composed combat, shot down three enemy aircraft and damaged five others in just two hours, severely打击 (dǎ jī - strike a blow to, attack) the arrogance of the American air pirates and protected the safety of the bridge. After discussion and approval by the military merit evaluation committee, the battalion is awarded a collective Second-Class Merit."

    严惩美国空中强盗
    陈兵
    六月二十五日，警卫着北汉江上游某地大桥的一支志愿军高射炮部队，在二小时内粉碎了分五批共四十八架次的敌机的侵袭，创造了在一次战斗中击落击伤敌机八架的光辉纪录。
    下午一时十五分，二个大编队的敌机群在四号方向的云端出现了，发动机响声由远而近，打破了朝鲜前线稀有的寂静。
    阵地上响起了战斗警号。炮手们跃出休息室立即走上各自的战斗岗位。测远机手精确地报告着敌机的高度；炮管随着高空敌机灵活地转着圈子。
    在三千公尺的上空，四架敌机摆成一路队形开始俯冲了；目标是十四号方向的一个目标。
    “坚决打呀！同志们！今天是朝鲜反侵略战争两周年纪念日，我们要争取击落敌机，替朝鲜人民报仇呀！”
    “立功的机会来了，同志们瞄准狠狠地打呀！”
    战士们互相鼓励着。
    敌机一架挨紧一架猛冲下来了，一串串带着火尾的火箭炮弹向下倾泻，一批批的炸弹、凝固汽油弹崩起了巨大的烟柱。从远处的山谷里传来了轰隆隆的回响。
    “瞄准领航机！打！打！打！”连珠炮弹喷着火焰呼啸着射出去了；我们的高射机枪也吐出一条条火链。
    空中响起了一种金属碎裂的声音。在一千六百公尺的上空，一发炮弹命中了一架敌机的肚子；敌机抖着翅膀，闪着火光，拖着一条烈焰撞落在一座山岗上焚毁了。
    同时，有一个黑点在空中翻滚，几分钟以后一个红白相间的花伞迎风飘拂着降落下来。这是敌机驾驶员跳伞了。
    “抓俘虏呀！”侦察员、共产党员吉振清，电话班班长、共产党员贾福恩一边喊着，一边背上步枪就朝敌机驾驶员降落的山坡飞跑。电话班副班长、共产党员杨彦小生病卧床一个多月了，但是一听说抓俘虏连忙下床，抓起了枪，一跛一拐地就往还在敌机扫射封锁下的山岗上走去了。
    从正在高云盘旋的敌机群中又窜下来四架，它们像饿狼一样吐着火舌向山沟扫射，配合着第一批敌机，用机枪和火箭炮弹把由山脚通到山脊的每条小路封锁起来，企图堵塞和阻击我翻着崖坡上山抓俘虏的战士。
    敌机穿插扫射着。一颗杀伤弹落在距离三炮阵地十多公尺远的地方爆炸了，平飞的破弹皮打伤了三炮手朱杰同志的小腹。三炮也出了故障，不能射击了。正在这时，忽然指导员乔恒斌同志穿过硝烟出现在三炮跟前，战士们都非常激动，向着指导员提出庄严的保证：“请指导员放心！我们一定保持和发扬英勇坚强的战斗作风，一定要替朝鲜死难的同志和我们的光荣挂彩的朱杰同志报仇！保证在十分钟内把炮的故障排除，争取击落第二架敌机！”
    “好好地打呀！狠狠地揍呀！同志们立功的机会到了！”
    “我们不但要保持全营集体三等功臣的荣誉，还要争取功上加功，当个集体一等功臣，争取每人胸前都挂个军功章！”
    四炮车长、共产党员、二等功臣何丰林，二炮车长、共产党员李斌都主动指挥自己的高射炮，用猛烈的火网掩护三炮同志进行阵前抢修。
    二十分钟以后，第三批敌机还没有飞走，第四批的四架“野马”又带着一架直升飞机闯来了。敌人的那架直升机擦着山顶的树丛低飞绕圈子。突然，松树林中就升起了二颗红色信号弹；当吉振清、贾福恩等同志冲过重重火网迫近山头的时候，就看见直升机放下一把软梯，把跳伞落地的那个敌机驾驶员救上飞机了。
    正当第三批敌机掩护着三架被击伤的敌机狼狈窜逃的时候，四架“野马”就用“剪子轴”阵形猛冲直插入我方阵地，希望分散我方密集火力，掩护直升飞机上升逃命。
    “瞄准直升机！打！打！打！狠狠地打！”又是一阵暴风骤雨似的炮弹长啸着飞出炮口了。刹时，在敌人直升飞机的周围就织成了一朵朵白色的烟球。山坡上的我方机枪也在怒吼了。
    “沉着气，瞄准光圈，对好标尺，狠狠揍它！同志们，争取击落直升机为全营增光呀！”高射机枪连一排长、共产党员段应堂亲自跑到一枪手、共产党员李忠孝跟前鼓舞他。李忠孝沉重地回答说：“请排长放心！只要有人有枪，保证击落直升机，保持咱营三等功臣的荣誉，决不让美国空中强盗横行。”三炮手、青年团员巩文祥主动修正速度升降角，二炮手、共产党员陈停中也把瞄准镜上的十字焦点紧紧对准直升机的大肚子。“通通通通通！”就来了个快点射。刚飞到七百公尺空中的直升机，便冒出一团烈火，竖起尖长的黑尾巴，笔直地坠毁在距离阵地千把公尺远的麦地上了。两个敌机驾驶员跳伞摔死了，一个驾驶员当了友邻部队的俘虏。
    一架银灰色的“野马”竟不顾死活地加大油门、猛冲下来。炮手们说：“来吧！再下来几十架也要揍你个稀巴烂！”冲下来的这架敌机还没有来得及射击，就被飞上天空的我方的三颗炮弹命中腹部爆炸了，闪着几团火光，拖着一条烟柱，翻着筋斗坠毁在一片矮树林中了。这只敌机的残骸离开直升机的尸体不过六百公尺。
    我军准确猛烈的射击，迫使最后一批敌机带着两架负伤的“野马”丧魂落魄地上升到五千公尺的高空，一溜烟地逃跑了。
    阵地上响起了一阵胜利的欢呼声。一场延续两个钟头的激战就这样胜利结束了。
    在滚滚东流的北汉江江畔，升起了三堆烈火熊熊的烟柱，在一堆堆破铅烂铝的灰烬中，躺着烧剩半截的弹痕累累的敌机机身；二十公尺外的沙滩上，蜷曲着三个烧得焦黑的美国驾驶员的尸体。
    第二天，传遍全军的记功令上写着：
    “……六月二十五日，敌人企图破坏我某地大桥，集中了大量的机群进行扫射轰炸，我守卫在大桥附近的高射炮某营全体勇士们，以机智沉着的战斗，仅在二小时内即击落敌机三架，击伤五架，严重地打击了美国空中强盗的气焰，保卫了大桥的安全。经军评功委员会讨论并批准给予该营集体记二等功一次。”
