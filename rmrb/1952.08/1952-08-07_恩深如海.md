    Kindness Deeper Than the Sea
    Xin Ke
    In Lhasa and the areas where the People's Liberation Army marches and is stationed, a Tibetan phrase is spreading among the Tibetan people—"Rinchen" (meaning kindness deeper than the sea). This is used to express gratitude for the People's Liberation Army's great actions in relieving their suffering from diseases.
    As early as the march into Tibet, the People's Liberation Army's reputation for treating Tibetan compatriots along the way had already crossed the Kang-Tibetan corridor and spread into the Tibetan region. Last November, troops stationed in Lhasa specifically established an army-civilian clinic for the Tibetan people, with departments for dermatology, venereal diseases, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, surgery, and ENT, providing free diagnosis and treatment of various diseases for Tibetan compatriots. Since then, even more people have sought medical treatment from the People's Liberation Army. In the five months leading up to the end of April this year, the clinic had already treated over 8,000 Tibetan people for a total of 20,256 visits, with the cost of medication alone estimated at over 200 million RMB.
    The Tibetan people who have received treatment all say excitedly, "The People's Liberation Army not only provides free treatment, but also gives the best and most effective medicine, and the doctors care for the patients like their own family." They spread the word everywhere, and the number of people seeking treatment is increasing. Last October, the advance detachment into Tibet only treated 156 people. In December, the Lhasa Army-Civilian Clinic had 1,293 outpatient visits, and this increased to 6,140 visits in April this year. The people of Lhasa have developed a habit: when they are sick, they go to Mi Mang Mi Kang (People's Clinic). Sometimes, when patients follow their old custom and seek divination from lamas, the lamas' response is: "Go to the doctors of the People's Liberation Army!" Many sick lamas also come to the clinic for treatment.
    In the past, due to the lack of scientific advancement, disease had become a serious threat to the lives of the Tibetan people. Many sick people died or contracted chronic viruses due to the lack of scientific treatment. The infant mortality rate was as high as 40 percent or more. Now, the doctors of the People's Liberation Army are doing their best to treat Tibetan compatriots. When there are many patients, they postpone their dinner time; the doctors who make house calls often go out to treat patients at any time, day or night, rain or shine. Many Tibetan people have been cured of dangerous diseases and chronic viruses, including syphilis, pneumonia, edema, and various other forms of tuberculosis. In the past, the Tibetan people left childbirth to fate, but now they have adopted scientific methods and invite the female doctors of the People's Liberation Army to deliver babies for expectant mothers. The Tibetan people use "Rinchen" to describe the People's Liberation Army, which also expresses their love for the big family of the motherland. Qinrao Norbu, Director of the Medical Bureau of the Tibetan local government, said: "We sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army doctors for their noble act of saving many critically ill patients."
    After the child of Lobsang Tsocu, a Tibetan aristocrat, was cured of pneumonia and whooping cough, he personally ran to the clinic to thank the doctors: "Last year, a similar illness killed one of my sons; this year, this child was also on the verge of death, but you saved him. Our whole family will never forget your kindness." After the illness of Gongdelin Xiangzi (a lama official title), one of the four lineages of Tibet, was cured, he asked the sick lamas in the temple to go to the clinic for treatment. The People's Liberation Army doctors have revived many sick children from the brink of death, and their parents said with infinite joy: "The child's life was given by the People's Liberation Army. When he grows up, we will tell him to repay the People's Liberation Army and Chairman Mao well." Tibetan Western-style doctor Lobsang Yangpei was so moved that he automatically helped the clinic with translation and treatment work. He said:
    "The People's Liberation Army doctors work tirelessly and selflessly to treat the Tibetan people. I am very happy to help the clinic."
    The Tibetan people spread the word, and everyone knows that the People's Liberation Army can relieve them of the suffering of disease. Every day, there is an endless stream of people coming to the clinic for treatment, including lamas from the three major monasteries of Lhasa wearing red robes, colorfully dressed Tibetan aristocratic men and women, Tibetan military officers and soldiers, urban workers, citizens, and merchants; there are also herdsmen and farmers who have traveled long distances from the pastoral areas of northern Tibet, southern Tibet, and rear Tibet. These people from different regions and different occupations all praise in unison: "The doctors are good! The People's Liberation Army is good! Chairman Mao is good! We will never forget the People's Liberation Army's kindness, which is as deep as the sea."

    恩深如海
    辛可
    在拉萨以及进藏人民解放军经过与驻扎的地区，藏族人民流传着一句藏语——“仁青”（恩深如海的意思），这是用来感谢人民解放军为他们解除疾病痛苦的伟大行动的。
    早在进军的时候，人民解放军沿途为藏胞治病的美名，已穿过康藏通道，传进了西藏地区。去年十一月底，进驻拉萨的部队，特地为藏胞创办了一个军民门诊所，分设皮肤、花柳、小儿、妇产、内外和五官等科，免费为藏胞诊治各种病症。从此，请解放军看病的人更多了。到今年四月底的五个月中，门诊所即已为八千多个藏民治疗了二万零二百五十六次，所需费用单以药品一项计算，就值人民币二亿多元。
    看过病的藏族人民都兴奋地说：“解放军治病既不要钱，又都是给的最好最有效验的药，而且医生们像亲人一样地关怀病人。”他们到处宣扬，就诊的人越来越多了。去年十月份，进藏先遣部队只治了一百五十六个人，十二月份，拉萨军民门诊所门诊次数就达一千二百九十三次，今年四月份，更增加到六千一百四十次。拉萨市民养成了这样一个习惯：有了病就到米茫米康（人民门诊所）去。有时，病人照过去的习惯去找喇嘛打卦，喇嘛打卦的回答是：“去找人民解放军的医生吧！”有病的喇嘛也多半到门诊所来治病了。
    在过去由于科学不发达，疾病成了藏族人民生活上一个严重的威胁。有不少生病的人，因缺乏科学治疗，死的死了，或染上了慢性病毒。婴儿的死亡率竟达百分之四十以上。现在，人民解放军的医生竭尽全力为藏胞治病，病人多时，他们就推迟晚饭的时间；出诊的医生往往不分昼夜和晴雨随时应邀外出治病。许多藏族人民在这里治好了危险的疾病和慢性病毒，包括梅毒，肺炎，水肿和其他各种结核病。过去藏族人民对生育是听天由命的，现在也采用了科学的方法，请人民解放军的女医生为产妇接生。藏族人民用“仁青”来形容人民解放军，也表示了对祖国大家庭的热爱。西藏地方政府医药局长钦绕诺布说：“我们衷心感谢人民解放军医生救活许多垂危病人的崇高行为。”
    西藏贵族洛桑错固的幼儿，患肺炎和百日咳被治好后，他亲自跑到门诊所向医生道谢：“去年这样的病，害死了我的一个儿子；今年这个孩子眼看也快死了，可是你们给救活了。我们全家永远忘不了你们的恩德。”西藏四林之一功德林相子（喇嘛官名）的疾病告愈后，他叫寺里有病的喇嘛，都到门诊所去看病。人民解放军医生把许多生病的幼儿，从死亡的边缘复活过来，他们的双亲无限惊喜地说：“孩子的命是解放军给的，长大以后叫他好好报答人民解放军和毛主席。”藏族西医洛桑洋沛感动地自动帮助门诊所作翻译和治疗工作。他说：
    “人民解放军的医生不辞劳苦毫无代价地为西藏人民治病，我是非常高兴帮助门诊所做事的。”
    藏族人民一传十，十传百，都知道人民解放军能给他们解除疾病的痛苦。每天来门诊所看病的络绎不绝，有披着红色袈裟的拉萨三大寺的喇嘛，有服装鲜艳的西藏贵族男女，有藏军官兵，有城市工人、市民、商人；也有从藏北牧区、藏南及后藏远道赶来的牧民、农民等。这些来自不同地区、不同职业的人们，都异口同声地赞扬说：“医生好！人民解放军好！毛主席好！我们永远不会忘记人民解放军的如海深恩。”
