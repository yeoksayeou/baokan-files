Thoroughly Eliminate Anti-People Old Legal Views
Li Guangcan, Li Jianfei

(I)
In the "Three-Anti" movement in the judicial organs, we not only understood the corruption and violation of laws and disciplines of some judicial personnel, but also saw the strong old legal views existing in many judicial workers.

The so-called old legal viewpoint refers to the "Six Codes" of the Kuomintang reactionaries and all their reactionary legal viewpoints, including the entire set of anti-people rule of law left by the reactionary rulers, from the ideological system of law to the judicial organization system and many methods and styles of ruling and suppressing the people. After liberation, although the reactionary regime was overthrown, because many old judicial organs were peacefully taken over, a large number of old judicial personnel were retained, and some revolutionary cadres were also affected by the old laws and old judicial personnel due to their vague positions and viewpoints, the old legal viewpoints were not eliminated, but existed quite universally. In the current judicial reform movement, we must regard the thorough liquidation and elimination of old legal viewpoints as one of the most important tasks.

(II)
What are the manifestations of the old legal viewpoint?

First, it violates the principle of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and serves the enemies of the people with fallacies such as the so-called "equality before the law for everyone" and "no investigation of past events." Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The state apparatus, such as the army, police, and courts, is an instrument of class oppression." This means that the people's judicial organs should protect the interests of the people and exercise dictatorship over the enemy, implementing merciless suppression. However, people with old legal viewpoints regard the people's judicial work as merely a technical work to resolve disputes within the people, and only as work to handle general criminal and civil cases. In the land reform, some judicial personnel treated landlords and peasants equally, adopting an attitude of "treating everyone the same" regardless of the enemy and ourselves, making the landlords arrogant and sophistical in court; while the peasants were restricted when speaking. A sub-court of the People's Court in a certain district of a certain county in northern Anhui strictly announced the so-called twelve "court rules" when opening the court for trial, scaring the peasants to speak; but the landlords talked freely. These judicial personnel did not understand that the people's court was to ensure that peasants could carry out the anti-feudal struggle in an orderly manner and suppress the resistance of landlords, so they actually supported the landlords. The masses in Hangzhou reported the traitor and secret agent Xu Shuanglin three times, but the People's Court refused to convict him on the grounds that "the defendant committed the crime during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang" and considered it "statute-barred," which is also a typical example.

Second, they are indifferent to the interests of the state and the people. For example, the Shenyang Private Merchant Technician Cooperative contracted the production of a surge protector for a state-owned repair factory. Due to the poor quality of the bakelite joint plate, an explosion occurred during use, resulting in deaths and equipment damage. After four tests by the Power Supply Bureau and others, it was proved that the surge protector did not meet the specifications, and the repair factory demanded compensation for the damage. A judicial officer of the Northeast Branch of the Supreme People's Court handled the case and ruled: "From the perspective of long-term interests... in accordance with the spirit of benefiting both public and private... ordering the appellant (private merchant) to bear less losses is equivalent to developing industry, cultivating and caring for technology,... In order not to destroy the development of such private electrical industries, we should take care of their future operations. If they are made to bear two-thirds of the direct losses, it will affect the restoration and development of their enterprises. The appellee is a state-owned enterprise, and its development will not be affected by such losses. Therefore, it is ruled that the appellant shall bear one-third of the losses, and the appellee shall bear two-thirds of the losses." Isn't this a very obvious distortion of the economic policy of the People's Government, shirking the responsibility for the crime of illegal capitalists cutting corners, and taking it for granted that state-owned enterprises suffer losses? This is how old legal views help illegal bourgeois elements undermine the country's economic construction.

Third, there is a serious detachment from the masses, making the judicial organs "bureaucratic," developing into a "master" style of suppressing the people, as well as old mechanical procedures, cumbersome procedures, simply sitting in court and interrogating, delaying case handling, and so on.

Many judicial personnel believe that without procedures or incomplete procedures, cases cannot be handled. If divorce cases that have not been mediated by the district are accepted, they must be sent back to the district for re-mediation in order to comply with the procedures. Some women are obviously suffering from the persecution of feudal families and are in danger of their lives, but some judicial organs refuse to deal with them because these women cannot write complaints. In the event of civil cases involving criminal cases, they only handle the civil part and are unwilling to handle the criminal part together, and the parties must file a separate lawsuit for the criminal part. Some courts have to go through more than 30 procedures from the beginning to the end of handling a case. Cumbersome and slow old judicial procedures have been used almost unchanged in some judicial organs.

Fourth, emphasizing the so-called "judicial independence." Because the people's judiciary is a component of the people's regime, and because of the characteristics of China's revolutionary development and the current conditions, a dual leadership system must be implemented: the central government should exercise unified leadership in terms of national policies, guidelines, laws, and regulations; how to specifically implement them locally should also be subject to the leadership of the local government. This is conducive to the unified leadership of the central government and also conducive to adapting to local conditions. However, the old legal viewpoint requires mystifying and specializing judicial work. It transplanted the so-called "separation of powers" of the bourgeoisie's "judicial independence" (the bourgeoisie's judiciary is not actually independent, but only a deception), inappropriately emphasizing the vertical system of judicial organs unilaterally. They believe that the county and city heads concurrently serving as court presidents violates the spirit of "judicial independence"; they believe that the president's control over the judgments of cases infringes on the power of the judges. Some people believe that since suppressing counter-revolutionaries is judicial work, it should not be handled by military courts, otherwise it will "hinder" the judicial organs from exercising their functions "independently."

Fifth, detaching from mass movements, detaching from central work, handling cases in isolation, thinking that "engaging in movements is not the court's business," "taking the mass line to handle cases is sometimes right, sometimes not necessarily"; believing that taking the mass line is the line and method of general work, not or not completely the line and method of judicial work; some people even put forward the so-called "judicial line" to oppose the mass line. As a result, some courts have become detached from the masses, detached from politics, detached from the leadership of party and government organs, and suspended in mid-air.

(III)
To eliminate the old legal viewpoint and establish the people's legal viewpoint, it is necessary to carry out in-depth ideological struggle. This is one of the basic tasks in the current construction of the people's judiciary.

People with old legal viewpoints are reluctant to part with the "Six Codes." They believe that "the Six Codes are the most complete legislation," that "the provisions of the old Six Codes are concise and meaningful." They like to compare the provisions of the "Six Codes" with our current legal provisions. When they see that the two seem to be the same on the surface, they are very satisfied. When they see that they are different, they do not criticize the old, but criticize the new, trying to make our laws conform to the style of the old laws.

A judicial worker who studied old laws made this self-criticism:

"Regarding the old law, I adopted an attitude of 'critically accepting' rather than completely abolishing it. In fact, I used a new coat to decorate my ugly face of maintaining the old law. My so-called 'critically accepting' was looking at the problem from the point of view that 'the old law is useful,' finding a market for the old law under the good name of 'critically accepting,' and looking at the new and old laws in isolation and making formal comparisons. Believing that as long as the new law has it, it will no longer be the old legal viewpoint, so I boldly used the old concepts to explain it; what the new law does not have, I feel at a loss, and when I encounter specific problems, I wrap the old concepts in a new coat, hoping to supplement it in secret."

Another judicial worker reviewed and said: "My view on the 'Six Codes' is: Although the 'Six Codes' have been abolished, the new laws that will be formulated in the future will still be a set that is 'almost the same.' The problem with China in the past was not that the laws were bad, but that the government did not act according to the laws. Therefore, I think that the 'Six Codes' do not really need to be completely abolished, just delete or modify those parts that conflict with the current regime and policies."

Some judicial workers believe that "new laws only exist under the scale of old laws," "the foundations may be different, but laws are still laws after all"; "some clauses of the old law have international universality." Some even dogmatically believe that after the country's construction is further regularized, the old laws he is familiar with will be useful.

Some people also say: You cannot criticize the old law until you first formulate your own complete set of laws. They believe that using Marxism-Leninism can only criticize other theories, but not the old law. They portray the law as a mysterious and elusive thing to show the "independence" and profoundness of the law. All of these show that the old legal viewpoint is deeply rooted in the minds of some people. They often play a role in various issues in various forms. It is impossible to accept new viewpoints without eradicating these old legal viewpoints. To eradicate these old legal viewpoints, we must conduct in-depth criticism and ideological struggle, and thoroughly solve the problem of where the ass is sitting.

Some so-called "legal experts" have forgotten that their golden signboard was hung up in the legal career of the old society; what they are "specialized" in is no longer in line with the needs of today's people's era. But they cling to the old law and ignore or despise the rich judicial experience created by the masses of the people in the long-term revolutionary movement, clamoring that the new China has "no law," and even publishing the fallacy that "bad law is better than no law." What is the fact? Although the laws of our country are not yet complete today and need to be continuously summarized by the people's creation to gradually complete them; but if we can face up to the history of the Chinese people's judiciary and the creation of the masses for more than 20 years, it should be said that the laws of our country are already quite rich. The fact that our People's Government has promulgated many important basic laws and many other laws, regulations, ordinances, and resolutions in the past three years is clear evidence. But some "legal experts" stubbornly refuse to admit that this is the law, and absurdly advocate using the "Six Codes" they like by "changing its face." If we do not carry out a resolute struggle against this tendency, the people's judicial organs will lose the role of the people's democratic dictatorship weapon, and the construction of the people's judiciary will become impossible.

It should be pointed out that the people's law can only be created by the people themselves, and can only be created under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This creation requires breaking all the shackles of the old law, not being restricted by any old law, and relying on the conscious will and revolutionary struggle practice of the masses of the people. We can only have one policy for the old legal viewpoint, that is, to thoroughly eliminate it. Any form and any degree of retention is wrong.

Judicial workers across the country, rise up and fight to thoroughly eliminate old legal viewpoints and establish people's legal viewpoints!

    肃清反人民的旧法观点
    李光灿　李剑飞
    （一）
    在司法机关的“三反”运动中，我们不仅了解了某些司法人员的贪赃枉法和违法乱纪行为，同时也看到了许多司法工作人员中存在着浓厚的旧法观点。
    所谓旧法观点，就是国民党反动派的“六法全书”及其一切反动的法律观点，包括反动统治者所遗留的反人民的整套法治，从法律的思想体系到司法的组织制度以及许多统治、压制人民的方法和作风。解放以后，反动政权虽然被推翻了，但因有许多旧司法机关被和平接管，旧司法人员被大量留用，有些革命的干部也由于立场观点模糊，受了旧法律和旧司法人员的影响，所以旧法观点并未肃清，而且相当普遍地存在着。在目前的司法改革运动中，我们必须把彻底清算与肃清旧法观点当做最重要的任务之一。
    （二）
    旧法观点有那些表现呢？
    第一，违反巩固人民民主专政的原则，用敌我不分的所谓“法律面前人人平等”和“既往不究”等谬论来为人民的敌人服务。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中明白指出：“军队、警察、法庭等项国家机器，是阶级压迫阶级的工具。”这就是说，人民的司法机关要保护人民的利益，向敌人实行专政，实行无情的镇压。但是，具有旧法观点的人，却把人民司法工作看作只是在人民内部排解纠纷的技术工作，只是处理一般刑事民事案件的工作。在土地改革中，有的司法人员把地主和农民同样看待，采取了不分敌我的“一视同仁”态度，使地主在法庭上趾高气扬，狡赖诡辩；而农民在讲话时反而受到限制。皖北某县某区人民法庭分庭在开庭审判时，严格宣布所谓“庭规”十二条，吓得农民不敢讲话；地主们却侃侃而谈。这些司法人员不懂得人民法庭就是要保障农民有秩序地进行反封建的斗争，镇压地主的反抗，因而他们在实际上支持了地主。杭州市群众三次检举汉奸特务分子徐双林，人民法院却以“被告犯罪在国民党反动统治时期”为理由，认为“已失时效”，而不予判罪，也是典型的例子。
    第二，是对国家和人民的利益漠不关心。比如，沈阳市私商技工社为国营某修理厂承制塞流器，因胶木接头板质量不好，使用时爆炸，造成死亡和器材损失。经电业局等四次试验结果，证明塞流器不合规格，修理厂要求赔偿损害。最高人民法院东北分院一个司法人员承办此案，判决说：“从长远利益计……按照公私两利精神……令上诉人（私商）少担负损失即等于发展工业，培养及照顾技术，……为了不摧残此类私人电业上之发展，即应照顾其今后营业，如使其负担直接损失三分之二，则即影响其企业的恢复和发展。而被上诉人系国营企业，在其发展上不致受此种损失而影响。故判上诉人负担三分之一，被上诉人负担三分之二。”这不是极明显地歪曲了人民政府的经济政策，为不法资本家偷工减料的罪行脱卸责任，而以国营企业遭受损失为理所当然吗？旧法观点就是这样帮助不法资产阶级分子破坏国家经济建设的。
    第三，是严重的脱离群众，使司法机关“衙门化”，发展为压制人民的“老爷”作风，以及旧的机械程序，手续繁琐、单纯坐堂问案、拖延办案等等。
    有许多司法人员认为，没有程序或程序不完备，就无法办案。受理了未经区上调解过的离婚案件，便一定要送回区上去从新调解，以求合于程序。有的妇女明明在受着封建家庭的迫害，有生命危险，而某些司法机关却因这些妇女不会写状子而不予处理。遇着民事牵涉刑事的案件，便专门办理民事部分而不肯把刑事部分合并处理，一定要当事人另案提起刑事部分的诉讼。有的法院办理一件案子，从始到终要经过三十几道手续。繁琐迟滞的旧司法程序，在某些司法机关中几乎是原封不动地被搬用了。
    第四，强调所谓“司法独立”。由于人民司法是人民政权的组成部分，由于中国革命发展的特点以及目前的条件，必须实行双重领导：在全国的方针、政策、法令等方面，应由中央统一领导；如何在当地具体执行，则应同时受地方的领导。这样既利于中央的统一领导，又利于地方的因地制宜。但旧法观点却要求把司法工作神秘化、特殊化。它把资产阶级的所谓“三权鼎立”的“司法独立”（资产阶级的司法在实际上也不是独立的，而只是一个欺骗）搬了过来，不适时宜地片面强调司法机关的垂直系统，对县、市长兼任法院院长，认为违反了“司法独立”的精神；对院长掌握案件的判处，认为是侵犯了审判员的权力。有的人认为镇压反革命既是司法工作，就不应由军法处办，否则就会“妨碍”了司法机关“独立”行使职权。
    第五，脱离群众运动，脱离中心工作，孤立办案，认为“搞运动不是法院的事”，“走群众路线办案有时对，有时就不见得”；认为走群众路线是一般工作的路线和方法，而不是或不完全是司法工作的路线和方法；有人竟至提出所谓“司法路线”来和群众路线相对立。这样，有些法院就脱离了群众，脱离了政治，脱离了党政机关的领导，在半空孤悬起来。
    （三）
    要肃清旧法观点，建立人民的法律观点，必须深入地开展思想斗争。这是目前人民司法建设中的基本任务之一。
    具有旧法观点的人舍不得“六法全书”，他们认为“六法全书是最完备的立法”，认为“旧六法的条文言简而意赅”，他们喜欢拿“六法全书”的条文和我们现行的法律条文对比。看到两者在表面上似乎相同时，就很满意，看到不同时，他们不去批判旧的，而是对新的横加挑剔，企图使我们的法律合乎旧法律的格调。
    有一位学过旧法的司法工作者这样作自我检讨：
    “对于旧法，我是抱了‘批判地接受’、而不是彻底废除的态度。其实，我是用了一件新外衣，装饰了我维护旧法的丑恶面貌。我那种所谓‘批判地接受’，是从‘旧法有用’的观点上看问题的，是在
    ‘批判地接受’的美名下为旧法找销路，把法律孤立起来看，把新旧法律作形式上的比较。认为只要是新法中有的，就不会再是旧法观点，就放胆地用旧的概念给以说明；新法中所没有的，就感到不知所措，在遇到具体问题时，就用新外衣裹上旧概念，希望在暗中给以补充。”
    另一位司法工作者检讨说：“我对于‘六法全书’的看法是：‘六法全书’虽说废除了，但将来新定出来的法，也还是‘差不多’的一套。过去中国的毛病，并不是法律不好，而是政府没有照法律做。因此认为‘六法全书’实在用不着全部废除，只要把那些和现在的政权、政策相抵触的部分删除或修改一下就够了。”
    还有的司法工作者认为：“新法律只是在旧法的尺度下存在着”，“基础尽可不同，法律终归还是法律”；“旧法的某些条款有国际通用性”。甚至武断地认为：在国家建设进一步正规化以后，他所熟悉的旧法律就会用得着了。
    还有的人说：不先把自己的法律制订成完整的一套，就不能批判旧法。以为运用马克思列宁主义只能批判别的学说，而不能批判旧法。他们把法律描写成神秘的、不可捉摸的东西，以显示法律的“独立性”和高深莫测。所有这些，都说明旧法观点在一部分人的头脑中是根深柢固的。他们时常在各种问题上通过各种形式发挥作用。不根除这些旧法观点，要接受新的观点是不可能的。而要根除这些旧法观点，就必须进行深入的批判和思想斗争，彻底解决屁股坐在那边的问题。
    有一些所谓“法律专家”，他们忘记了自己的这个金字招牌是在旧社会的法律生涯中挂了起来的；他们所“专”的东西已经不合乎今天人民时代的需要了。但他们却死抱着旧法不放，而忽视或轻视长期革命运动中由人民群众所创造的丰富的司法经验，大叫新中国“无法”，甚至发表“恶法胜于无法”的谬论。事实怎样呢？我们国家的法律今天固然还不完备，需要不断地总结人民的创造，使它逐渐完备起来；但我们如果能正视二十多年来中国人民司法的历史和群众的创造，应该说我们国家的法律已经相当丰富了。三年来我们人民政府已公布了不少重要的基本大法和其他许多法律、法令、条例和决议，就是明证。但有些“法律专家”却硬不承认这是法律，荒谬地主张将他们所喜爱的“六法全书”
    “改头换面”来用。如果不和这种倾向进行坚决的斗争，人民的司法机关就会丧失其人民民主专政武器的作用，人民司法的建设就会成为不可能。
    应该指出，人民的法律只有人民自己才能创造出来，只有在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指导下才能创造出来。这种创造，需要打破一切旧法的束缚，不受任何旧法的限制，依靠着人民群众自觉的意志和革命斗争的实践。我们对于旧法观点只能有一个方针，那就是彻底肃清它。任何形式和任何程度的保留都是错误的。
    全国的司法工作人员起来，为彻底肃清旧法观点和树立人民法律观点而斗争！
