    The People Love Their Own Airplanes
    Moved Aviation Athletes
    To the Editor: We are athletes participating in the "August 1st" Sports Meet aviation performance. The "August 1st" Sports Meet has ended, and it has left a deep impression on our minds. After the performance on August 10th, we got off the plane, and a comrade told us: "There was an old woman in her sixties who wanted to squeeze into the venue. The ticket inspector said very kindly to her that those without tickets could not enter. She said anxiously: 'Comrade, let me in! You don't know, I suffered enough from enemy planes in the past, and I have been looking forward to seeing the people's planes fly into the sky to protect us every day. Today, my wish has come true. I came from Tianjin last night, let me see my own plane.'"
    "Let me see my own plane," this is not just a simple saying of one person, but the wish of the people of the whole country. On August 10th, although the weather was very bad and low clouds filled the sky above the airport, we still performed with full confidence. When we flew over the airport for the first time, the sea of people under the wings was applauding and cheering for us. Our blood was boiling, and we felt that our responsibility was even greater. We are even more determined to continue to study aviation technology and improve our political understanding.

    人民热爱自己的飞机
    感动了航空运动员
    编辑同志：我俩是参加“八一”体育运动大会航空表演的运动员。“八一”体育运动大会已经结束了，它在我们脑海里留下了深刻的印象。八月十日表演完毕后，我俩下了飞机，一个同志告诉我们说：“有一位六十多岁的老大娘，想挤进会场，检票员就很和气地对她说没有票的不能进去。她着急地说：同志，让我进去罢！你不知道啊，我过去受够了敌机带来的苦头，我天天都在盼望着能亲眼看到人民的飞机飞上天空，保护我们。今天我的愿望实现了。我是昨天晚上从天津赶来的，让我看看自己的飞机罢。”
    “让我看看自己的飞机罢”，这不是一个人的简单言语，而是全国人民的愿望。八月十日那天，虽然天气很坏，低云布满了机场的上空，但是我们仍信心百倍地进行了表演。当我俩第一次飞过机场的上空时，机翼下的人山人海正在向我们鼓掌、欢呼。我们的血沸腾着，感到自己的责任倍加重大。我们更加坚定了我们的意志，要继续努力学习航空技术，提高政治水平。　　　　赵瑞清　张仲仁
