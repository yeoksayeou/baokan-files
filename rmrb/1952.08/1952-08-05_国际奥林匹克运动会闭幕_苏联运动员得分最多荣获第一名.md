    国际奥林匹克运动会闭幕
    苏联运动员得分最多荣获第一名
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会在三日闭幕。这次运动会从七月十九日开始连续进行了十六天，七十个国家的将近七百个运动员参加了各项竞赛。
    苏联运动员就获得的分数来说在比赛中获得第一名。苏联的选手创造了两项世界纪录、三项欧洲纪录和十二项苏联纪录。
    下午七时举行闭幕仪式。旗手们开始进入中央体育场。他们举着参加奥林匹克运动会的各个国家的国旗前进。每个旗手的旁边都走着本国一个运动员。按照传统，希腊旗手走在队伍的前面。当苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的国旗出现时，全场响起了热烈的掌声。擎着苏联国旗的是获得本届运动会中量级举重冠军的苏联选手罗玛金，苏联选手、世界纪录保持者齐宾娜和他并肩走着。
    旗手们在主席台前围成半圆形。接着，国际奥林匹克运动委员会主席艾德斯特隆登上主席台，宣布第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会闭幕。这时乐声响彻全场，奥林匹克火炬熄灭。
    接着，礼炮齐鸣，奥林匹克会旗徐徐降下。在合唱队和乐队演奏的奥林匹克运动会会歌声中，奥林匹克会旗被拿出运动场。参加奥林匹克运动会的各国旗手，按着乐声的节奏跟在后面。最后，第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会就在芬兰国歌声中结束。
    芬兰总统巴锡基维、总理吉科宁，以及芬兰政府和各国外交使团的人员都参加了闭幕仪式。
