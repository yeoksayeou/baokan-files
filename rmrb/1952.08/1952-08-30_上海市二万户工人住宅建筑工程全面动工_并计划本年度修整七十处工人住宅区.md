Following the completion of 1,002 units of worker housing in Cao Yang New Village, Shanghai has commenced the full-scale construction of a large worker housing project, starting on the 15th of this month. This batch of 20,000 units of worker housing, capable of accommodating 100,000 people, is expected to rise from the fields of weeds and puddles by the turn of spring and summer next year. These worker residences are distributed across nine locations near the factory districts of East Shanghai, West Shanghai, and South Shanghai, covering an area of more than 4,000 mu. The total length of roads paved within the 20,000 worker housing units is 145 kilometers, equivalent to paving a road from Shanghai to Wuxi.

The construction of these residences fully complies with the principles of "sturdy, practical, economical, and rapid." All residences face south or southeast. Every one to two hundred households are arranged in groups, with four to five mu of open space in between for children to play. Every five to six thousand households are divided into a "neighborhood" or "village." The central area of each "neighborhood" or "village" generally has public buildings such as health clinics, nurseries, cooperatives, bank offices, and post offices. Primary schools are distributed in suitable locations, with children walking to school for no more than ten minutes. To facilitate residents, small vegetable markets, hot water shops, and stores will also be set up in a decentralized manner. In addition, space has been reserved in advance for public buildings such as cultural palaces, sports fields, and cinemas to accommodate future development.

Since August 15th, construction workers have begun this massive construction project with unprecedented enthusiasm. In the near future, the number of workers participating in the construction will reach approximately 13,000.

The Shanghai Municipal People's Government cares about the lives of working people and is vigorously improving the environmental sanitation of the original worker residential areas in the city. This year, it plans to renovate 70 worker residential areas. Twenty have already been completed, and work is underway in other areas. Upon completion of the entire project, the benefited area will be approximately five million square meters, benefiting more than 300,000 people.

According to investigations, there are more than 160 relatively concentrated worker residential areas in the city. During the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, most worker residential areas lacked underground drainage systems and had no decent sidewalks. "After a day of rain, you'd wear galoshes for ten days," and open-air stinking ditches were everywhere. In the summer, the stench was overwhelming, and mosquitoes and flies were rampant. Some areas did not even have a garbage can, and drinking water had to be bought half a mile away. Last year, the Municipal People's Government conducted investigations and studies on all worker residential areas and first renovated Yaoshui Lane, Shihuyao, and Hongzhen District, which received enthusiastic support from local workers and their families. This year, the Municipal People's Government decided to continue renovating 70 worker residential areas. The renovation includes burying drainage pipes and manholes, building roads, filling in stinking ditches, removing graves, adding latrines and garbage cans, and sweeping streets and spraying insecticides, installing water stations and street lights, etc. As of now, the renovation of twenty locations has been completed, and environmental sanitation has been greatly improved compared to the past. For example, in the Xilingjia residential area in Nanshi, more than 1,500 meters of drainage pipes of various diameters were buried, and 4,600 square meters of main and branch roads were paved. The Municipal People's Government spent more than 300 million yuan on drainage pipes and roads alone. The sanitation team of the Sanitation Bureau filled in stinking ditches and ponds in the area, placed more than a dozen garbage cans, built a public toilet, and sprayed insecticides twice. The Public Utilities Bureau installed three water supply stations in the area to ensure an adequate supply of tap water. Workers and their families living in these twenty locations are all grateful to the People's Government for their "tremendous benefits." As rickshaw puller Cui Changlai said: "Now we don't have flies and mosquitoes in our homes. Only the People's Government cares about us." (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海市二万户工人住宅建筑工程全面动工
    并计划本年度修整七十处工人住宅区
    继曹杨新村一千零二户工人住宅完工后，上海市大规模的工人住宅建筑工程，已于本月十五日开始全面动工兴建。这批能够容纳十万人的二万户工人住宅，预计明年春夏之交就将在现在还是遍地野草、水洼的工地上出现。这批工人住宅分布在沪东、沪西、沪南工厂区附近的九个地方，占地四千多亩。二万户工人住宅内铺筑的道路总长有一百四十五公里，等于铺筑一条从上海到无锡间的道路。
    这批住宅的建筑，完全符合了“坚固、合用、经济、迅速”的原则。住宅全部向南或向东南。每一、二百户排列成组，其间留有四、五亩空地，供儿童游戏之用。每五、六千户划分为一个“里”或“村”。“里”“村”的中心地区一般都有卫生所、托儿所、合作社、银行办事处、邮亭等公共建筑，小学则分布在适当地点，孩童上学步行至多不超过十分钟。为了便利住户，又将分散设置小菜场、热水店、商店等。此外还预先留下了文化宫、运动场、电影院等公共建筑的地位，以便将来配合发展。
    从八月十五日起，建筑工人们已经以空前高涨的劳动热情开始这批巨大规模的工程建筑了，不久的将来，参加建筑的工人将达一万三千人左右。

    上海市人民政府关心劳动人民的生活，大力改善市内原来工人住宅区的环境卫生。本年度计划修整七十处工人住宅区，现已有二十处完工，其他地区也正努力施工中。全部工程完工后，受益面积约五百万平方公尺，受益人口在三十万以上。
    据调查，市内比较集中的工人住宅区有一百六十余处。在帝国主义和国民党反动派统治时期，工人住宅区大都没有地下沟管的排水设备，也没有较好的行人道，“下一天雨，穿十天套鞋”，到处都是露天臭水沟，到了夏天，臭气薰人，蚊虫、苍蝇到处乱飞。有的地区连一个垃圾箱也没有，吃用的自来水要跑到半里路外去买。去年，市人民政府对所有的工人住宅区作了调查和研究，首先修整了药水弄、石灰窑与虹镇区等地方，得到了当地居住的工人和工人家属的热烈拥护。今年市人民政府决定继续修整七十处工人住宅区，修整内容包括埋设沟管、阴井，建筑道路；填平臭水沟，移除坟墓，添设大小便池和垃圾箱，并打扫路街，喷洒杀虫药剂；装设给水站和路灯等。截至目前止，已有二十处的修整工程已经竣工，环境卫生较前大为改善。如南市西凌家住宅区，共埋各种口径的沟管一千五百多公尺，铺设干、支道路面积四千六百平方公尺。单是沟管和道路，市人民政府即用去三亿余元。卫生局清洁队在该区填平了臭水沟池，放置垃圾箱十多个，又造了一个公共厕所，喷洒了两次杀虫药剂。公用局在该区装设了三个给水站保证了自来水的充分供应。居住在这二十处的工人及其家属们，都感谢人民政府对他们的“天大的好处”。如三轮车工人崔昌来说：“现在我们家里苍蝇蚊子没有了，只有人民政府才关心我们。”　（新华社）
