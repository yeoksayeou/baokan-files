Editor's Note: On June 27th, this newspaper published a letter on page 2 regarding the urgent need of farmers in mountainous areas of Shanxi Province for new-style agricultural implements, and suggested that the units related to this issue should conduct a serious examination and provide a public response. Some units have already conducted examinations separately. The Agricultural Policy Department of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory have also held several meetings specifically to discuss this issue. This problem, which mountainous farmers have repeatedly requested to be solved but has not been, has been given attention by the relevant departments. Some units related to this issue, such as the Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute, have not yet responded. We hope they can quickly write to us with their examination results.

The letter from the Agricultural Policy Department of the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture

Comrade Editor: After reading the self-criticism from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory regarding the hillside plow issue, which your newspaper requested our department to forward, we believe that this self-criticism is largely accurate.

Regarding this issue, we have held two meetings for self-criticism. In the past, our ideological leadership over the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory and other agricultural implement factories has been insufficient. In the past, in manufacturing and promoting new-style agricultural implements, we favored the plains areas and did not pay enough attention to the mountainous areas, which are the most difficult and lacking in agricultural implements. We also failed to fully implement the guidelines and tasks proposed at each agricultural implement conference. On the issue of the hillside plow, we did not promptly urge the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory and the Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute to take it seriously.

We are very grateful to the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union and the People's Daily for the opinions they have put forward to us. In the future, we must overcome various incorrect work styles, care about the most urgent demands of the broad masses of people, thoroughly implement the guidelines of the agricultural implement conference, and proactively contact the broad masses of farmers and agricultural organizations in various regions to improve and enhance our work.

Attached note: The "Changzhi Agricultural Implement Station in Shanxi" mentioned in the letter from our department published in the People's Daily on June 27th is a mistake for "Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Implement General Station." The Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Implement General Station was originally affiliated to the Shanxi Agricultural Extension Institute (belonging to the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture). Now the organization of this agricultural implement general station has been abolished, and its business operations have been merged into the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union, becoming the agricultural implement section of this union.

The letter from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory

Comrade Editor: After reading the letter from the Agricultural Implement Section of the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union regarding the hillside plow issue published in the People's Daily on June 27th, we successively convened meetings of leading cadres and all design personnel to examine our business ideology and work style.

(1) Our Process of Designing the Hillside Plow

We began designing the hillside plow in the spring of 1950 and completed the second design drafting work in September 1950. From October 1950 to March 1951, we successively produced five units and distributed them to Shanxi, Ningxia, Hubei and other places for testing; and in November 1950, Comrade Li Zhenyu from our factory took advantage of his trip to Taiyuan to participate in the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Exhibition to bring a hillside plow and conduct a test in the suburbs of Taiyuan. However, because the land tested in Taiyuan was not mountainous, we entrusted the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Extension Institute to continue the test in the mountainous areas, and instructed them to promptly inform us of the test results by letter. However, we did not receive their test report for a long time. On July 3, 1951, the Changzhi Enterprise Company of Shanxi sent a letter requesting the blueprints for the hillside plow. We informed them on the one hand that this type of plow was still in the testing phase and could not be manufactured in large quantities; on the other hand, we inquired about the test results from the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Implement General Station. It wasn't until November 5, 1951, that we received a letter from the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Implement General Station stating that the hillside plow had been tested once in Xinxian on October 11 and still had many shortcomings, and that a detailed test report would be sent later. We did not actively urge them afterwards. After the letter on this issue was published in the People's Daily on June 27 this year, we received a letter from the Eighth New Agricultural Implement Testing and Evaluation Group of Shanxi Province on July 11 regarding the improvement suggestions for the hillside plow.

At the National Agricultural Implement Conference convened by the Central Ministry of Agriculture in December 1951, everyone unanimously agreed that agricultural machinery design and research work must be divided and cooperated, and carried out with special responsibility; and it was considered that the hillside plow was not suitable for testing and research in Beijing. The conference resolved that our factory should assist the Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute in continuing the research. We wrote to the Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute on January 21 this year to discuss the method of carrying out design and research work. However, by April this year, we had not yet received a reply from the Northwest Agricultural Implement Research Institute. Fearing that we would delay the design and research work of the hillside plow, we drew cadres in early May this year to re-trial-produce the hillside plow in addition to the originally scheduled design and research tasks. The ten trial-produced hillside plows have now been completed and will be distributed to various places for testing within days. During the autumn plowing, we will also send technicians to key stations to personally conduct tests and listen to the opinions of farmers.

(2) Our Self-Criticism

What we should first criticize is our business thinking. We took the initiative to design the hillside plow in the spring of 1950, but up to now, we have not yet tested a result. It is entirely reasonable for mountainous farmers to make their demands and questions. The design work of the hillside plow has been delayed for a year and a half without results. The basic reason is that our pure economic viewpoint is at play. We believe that the hillside plow is not as important as the plow used in the plains, and we believe that even if the hillside plow is successfully designed, the demand will not be large, and it will not have much effect on expanding our factory's production; therefore, we have not actively carried out design and testing. For three years, as soon as all flat-land agricultural implements were successfully trial-produced, we immediately sent technicians to various places to conduct tests, listen to the opinions of farmers, and then improve them according to the opinions of farmers, so they were successful relatively quickly. For example, the No. 25 plow designed last year was initially successful in five months; the No. 20 plow designed this year was also successful in four months. But the hillside plow is not like this. This is enough to prove that we have not attached importance to the design work of the hillside plow. Before this examination, we also believed that it was right to first improve the flat-land agricultural implements and put the hillside agricultural implements behind; after this examination, we realized that doing so was actually thinking for the benefit of our factory, and we were not concerned enough about the urgent needs of mountainous farmers who are economically impoverished and particularly lack agricultural implements. This pure economic viewpoint is a manifestation of the residual bourgeois business ideology in our thinking.

Our work style is not solid enough. The hillside plow designed in 1950, we knew that there were still many shortcomings, but we still took it out for exhibition. In our product catalogs, and in the commemorative booklets that we gave to the representatives attending the agricultural implement conference in 1951, the "hillside plow" was printed. Our design and publicity are all based on the "reputation" of our factory and the economic interests of our factory. This is precisely the reflection of the decadent bourgeois ideology and work style on us.

This examination is of great benefit to us in improving our business work in the future. We will start with the design and research work of the hillside plow to improve our work. We must, under the leadership of the higher authorities, take the initiative to join hands with various brother factories and agricultural implement research institutes in various places, and under the support and supervision of the farmer brothers in the mountainous areas, complete the design and research work of the hillside plow as soon as possible; and during the autumn plowing, select technicians to carry hillside plows to participate in the test, and ensure that the design and trial-production tasks for 1952 are completed ahead of schedule, in order to respond to the concern of the broad farmer brothers for our factory's design and manufacture of new-style agricultural implements.

The letter from the Consultative Committee of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles of Shanxi Province

Comrade Editor: Regarding the issue of the mountain farmers in our province requesting the supply of hillside plows, we have conducted an inspection. The results of the inspection are answered as follows: The People's Representative Conference of All Circles of our province has held two general meetings and two expanded consultative committee meetings for the first session, and one general meeting for the second session. These five meetings received a total of 104 proposals requesting the supply of new agricultural tools, of which 27 requested the supply of hillside plows; these 27 proposals were proposed by the Standing Committee of the People's Representative Conference of eleven counties including Pingshun and Anze, as well as Chen Fengyi in Jincheng, Yang Zhiyuan in Zuoquan, and 32 other representatives. These proposals were classified and sorted by the Proposal Sorting Committee of the General Assembly, classified and reviewed by the Proposal Review Committee, presented in reports at the General Assembly, and decisions were made. After the meeting, the association immediately sent a letter to the relevant departments of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government for handling. The government also reported on the handling of the proposals of the previous meeting at the next meeting. However, because our province could not manufacture hillside plows, the proposals on hillside plows in previous meetings were all answered with words such as "transfer to the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory for manufacturing" and "being researched and tested, and will be supplied in large quantities once successful." After the closing of the first People's Representative Conference of the second session in our province this year, Zhou Guangchu and other seven provincial representatives from Fushan County also reflected the opinions of the masses who urgently requested the supply of hillside plows, and the association also reported them to the Provincial People's Government. Regardless of the proposals at the meeting or the reflections at ordinary times, although the association conveyed them in a timely manner, it did not promptly check and urge them. This shows that we did not pay enough attention to the proposals of the people's representatives and the opinions reflected by the people, and the work was not thorough enough. This is worthy of our inspection. We must pay attention to correcting it in the future.

Consultative Committee of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles of Shanxi Province

The letter from the Department of Agriculture of the People's Government of Shanxi Province

Comrade Editor: The mountain farmers in our province urgently need hillside plows. For two years, mountain farmers have continuously requested the government to manufacture and promote hillside plows through the Shanxi Daily and the People's Representative Conference of all circles in the province. During the Winter of 1950, when Shanxi convened a provincial conference of industrial and agricultural labor models, Li Zhenyu and two comrades from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory under the Central Ministry of Agriculture came to our province with a hillside plow for testing and public exhibition. At that time, due to the cold weather and frozen ground, only part of the test was carried out, and the hillside plow was left to the Shanxi Agricultural Extension Institute to be tested in the coming year. However, during the spring plowing in 1951, the extension institute did not grasp this matter. It was not until July 1951 that the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory sent a letter urging that the Provincial Agricultural Implement General Station conducted tests in Xinxian and other places, and reported the test results to the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory in November. This report had already included all the test details, but the drafter added the words "details will be reported later" at the end of the document, causing the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory to wait for detailed reports and fail to design and manufacture earlier. For this phenomenon, not only should the Agricultural Extension Institute and Agricultural Implement Station of our province conduct inspections, but we, the leadership of the Department of Agriculture, should also be primarily responsible for failing to earnestly supervise and inspect. We have conducted a profound inspection and distributed the five trial-produced hillside plows sent by the Central Ministry of Agriculture to various mountainous areas for testing, and will be responsible for completing this testing work. In addition, we will also organize, summarize, and promote the experience of labor models such as Li Shunda and Lian Quanbao in using seven-inch walking plows in mountainous areas, so as to solve the current technical guidance problems for mountain farmers using walking plows.

    中央农业部农政司、华北农业机械总厂等单位
    关于忽视山地犁问题的检讨和答复
    编者按：本报在六月二十七日第二版发表了关于山西省山区农民迫切要求供应新式农具的信件，并建议和这个问题有关的单位，认真进行检查，公开答复。有些单位已经分别作了检查，中央农业部农政司和华北农业机械总厂并且数次召开会议，专门讨论了这个问题。这个山区农民群众多次要求而未得解决的问题，已被有关部门重视起来了。有些和这个问题有关的单位，如西北农具研究所等还没有答复，希望能够很快把检查结果写信告诉我们。
    中央人民政府农业部农政司的信
    编辑同志：我们看了华北农业机械总厂请我司转给你们的关于山地犁问题的检讨，认为这个检讨尚属正确。
    对于这个问题，我们先后开会检讨了两次。我们过去对于华北农业机械总厂以及其他农具工厂的思想领导是不够的。我们过去对于制造和推广新式农具，偏重了平原地区，而对于最艰苦、最缺乏农具的山区却关心不够。我们对于每次农具会议提出的方针任务，也未能完全贯彻执行。在山地犁这个问题上，我们就没有及时督促华北农业机械总厂和西北农具研究所把它重视起来。
    我们很感谢山西省合作社联合社和人民日报给我们提出的意见。我们今后一定要克服各种不正确的工作作风，关心广大人民最迫切的要求，彻底贯彻农具会议的方针，主动联系广大农民及各地农业机构，来改进和提高我们的工作。
    中央人民政府农业部农政司
    附告：六月二十七日人民日报登载的我部来函所称“山西长治农具站”系“山西省农具总站”之误。山西省农具总站原附设于山西农业推广所（属于山西省农业厅），现在这个农具总站的机构已撤销，它的经营部分合并于山西省合作社联合社，成为这个联合社的农具科。
    华北农业机械总厂的信
    编辑同志：我们看了六月二十七日人民日报所载山西省合作社联合社农具科关于山地犁问题的信件以后，先后召开了领导干部及全体设计人员的会议，检查了我们的经营思想和作风。
    （一）我们设计山地犁的经过
    我们在一九五零年春开始设计山地犁，到一九五零年九月完成了第二次设计绘图工作。自一九五零年十月到一九五一年三月，陆续制出五部，分发给山西、宁夏、湖北等地试验；并在一九五零年十一月派我厂李振宇同志趁前往太原参加山西省农业展览会之便，携带一部山地犁，在太原郊外作了一次试验。但因在太原试验的土地并非山地，就委托山西省农业厅农业推广所继续到山区试验，并嘱托他们把试验结果及时函告我们。可是很久没有接到他们的试验报告。一九五一年七月三日山西长治企业公司来信要山地犁的蓝图。我们一方面函告他们这种犁还在试验阶段，还不能大量制造；一方面催询山西省农具总站试验结果。直到一九五一年十一月五日，收到山西省农具总站的信，信中说：山地犁于十月十一日曾在忻县试验一次，尚有很多缺点，待以后再将详细试验报告寄来。我们以后也没有主动积极地加以催促。今年六月二十七日人民日报发表了关于这个问题的信件以后，我们在七月十一日接到山西省新农具第八试验鉴定组有关山地犁改进意见的信。
    在一九五一年十二月中央农业部召开的全国农具会议上，大家一致认为农业机械设计研究工作必须分工合作，专责进行；并认为山地犁不宜在北京试验研究。会议决议由我厂协助西北农具研究所继续研究。我们在今年一月二十一日写信给西北农具研究所，商量进行设计研究工作的办法。但到今年四月，还没有接到西北农具研究所的回信。我们恐怕耽误了山地犁设计研究工作，就在今年五月初抽调干部在原订设计研究任务之外，重新试制山地犁。现在试制的十部山地犁已经做好，日内即可分发各地试验。到秋耕的时候，我们还要派技术人员到重点站亲自作试验，听取农民的意见。
    （二）我们的检讨
    我们首先应该检讨的是我们的业务思想。我们在一九五零年春主动设计山地犁，但一直到了现在，还没有试验出个结果。山区农民提出他们的要求和质问，是完全合理的。山地犁的设计工作一直拖延了一年半而没有结果，基本原因是我们的单纯经济观点在作祟。我们认为山地犁不如平原用的犁重要，认为山地犁即便设计成功了需要量不大，它对于扩大我厂的生产没有多大作用；因此，我们没有积极地进行设计和试验。三年以来，所有平地农具一旦试制成功，我们马上派技术人员到各地去试验，听取农民的意见，再根据农民的意见，加以改进，因此成功得比较快。像去年设计的二十五号犁，五个月就初步成功了；今年设计的二十号犁，四个月也成功了。可是山地犁就不是这样。这足以证明我们对山地犁的设计工作是没有重视的。在这次检查以前，我们还认为首先改进平地农具，把山地农具放在后边的看法是对的；经过这次检查以后，我们才认识到这样作其实是为本厂的利益着想，而对经济贫困、特别缺乏农具的山区农民的迫切要求却不够关心。这种单纯经济观点，是我们思想中残余的资产阶级经营思想的表现。
    我们的工作作风是不够踏实的。一九五零年设计的山地犁，我们明知道还有许多缺点，但仍然拿出去展览了。在我们的出品目录上，在一九五一年我们赠给参加农具会议的代表们的纪念册上，都印有“山地犁”。我们的设计和宣传都是从本厂的“名誉”、本厂的经济利益出发的。这正是资产阶级的腐朽思想作风在我们身上的反映。
    这次检查，对于我们今后改进业务工作是有很大好处的。我们就从山地犁的设计研究工作开始，来改进我们的工作。我们一定要在上级领导下，主动地和各兄弟厂以及各地农具研究所携起手来，在山区农民弟兄的支持和监督下，从速完成山地犁的设计研究工作；并在秋耕期间，选派技术人员携带山地犁去参加试验，保证提前完成一九五二年的设计试制任务，以答复广大农民弟兄对我厂设计制造新式农具的关怀。　　　　华北农业机械总厂
    山西省各界人民代表会议协商委员会的信
    编辑同志：关于我省山地农民要求供应山地犁问题，我们已经作了检查。兹将检查结果答复如次：本省各界人民代表会议，第一届开过两次大会、两次扩大协商委员会议，第二届开过一次大会。这五次会议共收到要求供应新式农具的提案一百零四案，其中要求供应山地犁者二十七案；这二十七案是平顺、安泽等十一个县的人民代表会议常务委员会以及晋城陈凤仪、左权杨志远等三十二位代表提出的。这些提案，都经过大会提案整理委员会分类整理，由提案审查委员会分类审查，在大会上提出报告，并做了决定。会毕，本会当即备函转送山西省人民政府承办部门办理。政府也在下次会议上对上次会议的提案做过办理情形的报告。惟因本省不能制造山地犁，所以对历次会议关于山地犁的提案，都是以“转请中央农业部和华北农业机械总厂制造”以及“正在研究试验，一经成功即行大量供应”等词答复代表。今年我省第二届第一次人民代表会议闭会后，又有浮山县的省代表邹光初等七人反映了群众迫切要求供应山地犁的意见，本会也都转告省人民政府。不论会议上的提案或平时的反映，本会虽然都及时转达了，但却没有及时检查、催办。这说明我们对人民代表的提案和人民反映的意见重视不够，工作不够深入。这是值得我们检查的地方。今后务必注意纠正。
    山西省各界人民代表会议协商委员会
    山西省人民政府农业厅的信
    编辑同志：我省山区农民迫切需要山地犁。二年来，山区农民曾通过山西日报社和省各界人民代表会议，不断要求政府制造和推广山地犁。一九五零年冬山西召开全省工农业劳动模范大会时，中央农业部所属华北农业机械总厂曾派李振宇等二同志携带一部山地犁来我省试验，并做公开展览。当时因天冷地冻，只进行了部分试验，就把山地犁留给山西农业推广所，留待来年试验。但一九五一年春耕时，推广所并没有抓紧这件事。直到一九五一年七月华北农业机械总厂来信催促，才由我省农具总站在忻县等地进行试验，十一月把试验结果报告华北农业机械总厂。这个报告本已把试验情况全部列入，但拟稿人却在文后赘上“详情续报”字样，致使华北农业机械总厂因等待详细报告，未能提早设计制造。对于这种现象，不仅我省农业推广所和农具站应作检讨，我们农业厅的领导方面由于未能认真督促检查，也应当首先负责。我们已经作了深刻检讨，并把中央农业部发来的五部试制山地犁，分发各山区进行试验，并要负责完成这一试验工作。此外，我们并将各地劳动模范如李顺达、连全保在山地使用七寸步犁的经验加以整理总结和推广，以便解决当前山区农民使用步犁的技术指导问题。
