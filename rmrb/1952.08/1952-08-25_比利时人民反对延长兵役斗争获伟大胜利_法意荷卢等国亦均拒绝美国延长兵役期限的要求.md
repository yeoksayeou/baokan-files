    The Belgian People's Struggle Against Extending Military Service Wins a Great Victory
    France, Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Other Countries Also Refuse the United States' Demand to Extend Military Service Terms
    [Report from this newspaper] Comprehensive news: Following the announcement by Britain and France that they are preparing to reduce their expansion plans, the expansion plan of the North Atlantic Group, orchestrated by the United States, has suffered another setback. Under pressure from their people, Western European governments have refused to agree to the United States' demand to extend military service terms.
    The matter first occurred in Belgium. More than one million Belgian working people responded to the call of the Belgian Communist Party and the General Labour Federation and held a national general strike on August 9th to oppose the government's extension of military service from one year to two years. During the strike, large-scale demonstrations were held in Brussels and many other places.
    The movement against extending military service had already begun among Belgian soldiers even earlier. According to the obligations undertaken by the Belgian government at the Lisbon meeting of the Atlantic Council, Belgium must greatly expand its armed forces, extend the term of military service from twelve months to twenty-four months, and massively conscript reservists. Belgian soldiers and people are firmly opposed to extending the term of military service. The ten thousand soldiers whose service expired on July 26 demanded to be sent home. The protest movement has also spread to the Belgian troops serving as occupying forces in West Germany. Belgian soldiers are demanding the abolition of the law extending military service, the release of soldiers arrested for participating in the struggle, and the cessation of the conscription of reservists. They have received the broad support of the Belgian working people, who have suffered the most from the policies of militarization and military expansion.
    The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party issued a message in the "Red Flag" newspaper, paying tribute to all soldiers and workers who bravely opposed the extension of military service, emphasizing that the general strike had achieved a great victory, and calling on the people to continue to strengthen the struggle.
    The Belgian government, panicked by the firm will of the broad masses of people to oppose the extension of military service, asked the other five member states of the "European Defense Community" – France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg – to jointly discuss the issue. These six countries held a meeting in Paris on August 12. However, within two hours of the start of the meeting, they unanimously announced that an agreement on the "standardization" of military service terms was currently impossible, and that all countries refused to extend the military service term to two years. Under pressure from the people, the Belgian cabinet decided on the 13th to actually shorten the originally determined military service term of twenty-four months to twenty-one months. Norwegian Defense Minister Lange also stated that Norway could not extend the term of military service at this time.

    比利时人民反对延长兵役斗争获伟大胜利
    法意荷卢等国亦均拒绝美国延长兵役期限的要求
    【本报讯】综合消息：继英法两国宣布准备削减扩军计划之后，美国所策划的北大西洋集团扩军计划又遭到了另一挫折。西欧各国政府在人民的压力下拒绝答应美国的延长兵役期限要求。
    事情首先发生在比利时。比利时一百多万劳动人民响应比利时共产党和总工会的号召，于八月九日举行了全国总罢工，反对政府把兵役期限从一年延长到两年。在罢工期间，布鲁塞尔及其他许多地方并举行了大示威。
    反对延长兵役期限的运动更早就已在比利时士兵中展开了。根据比利时政府在大西洋公约理事会里斯本会议上所承担的义务，比利时必须大大扩充它的武装部队，必须把兵役期限从十二个月延长到二十四个月，并且大规模征召后备兵。比利时的士兵和人民都坚决反对延长兵役期限。在七月二十六日服役期满的一万个士兵就要求把他们放回家去。抗议运动并已波及在西德充当占领军的比利时军队。比利时士兵们要求取消延长兵役期限的法律，同时要求释放因参加斗争而被捕的士兵，停止征召后备兵等。他们获得因为军国主义化和扩军运动政策而受害最深的比利时劳动人民的广泛支持。
    比共中央委员会政治局曾在“红旗报”上发表文告，向英勇反对延长兵役期限的全体士兵和工人致敬，强调总罢工获得伟大的胜利，同时号召人民继续加强斗争。
    由于广大人民表示了反对延长兵役期限的坚决意志，使得比利时政府惊惶失措，便要求“欧洲防御集团”的其他五个成员国——法国、西德、意大利、荷兰和卢森堡共同商议这一问题。这六个国家于八月十二日在巴黎举行会议。但是他们开会还不到两个钟头，就一致宣布：目前不可能得到兵役期限“标准化”的协议，各国都拒绝把兵役期限延长到二年。比利时内阁迫于人民的压力，已于十三日决定实际上把原已确定的兵役期限二十四个月缩短为二十一个月。挪威国防部长兰赫尔亦声称：挪威现在不能延长军役期限。
