Xinhua News Agency, August 26th:
In New Zealand, the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has attracted the attention of the broad masses of people. Montagu, the secretary of the New Zealand Peace Council, has been elected as a member of the New Zealand Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. He recently sent a letter to the Preparatory Committee in Beijing saying: they believe that they can elect a broad-based delegation, including people from all walks of life, to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th:
Rewi Alley, the New Zealand representative attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, recently published an article entitled "A New Step Towards Peace - The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference," in which he discussed the important significance of convening the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. He said: Today, people all over the world are demanding peace and a better life. However, wars are still going on, civilians are being massacred, people are paying unprecedentedly heavy taxes for military expansion, and science is being used to invent new weapons of mass destruction. We see children with missing arms and legs in Korea, and in the United States, we see children cowering under desks during bombing tests. Despite these facts, "peace" remains the most popular word in all languages. Without peace, other things that humanity needs cannot have full meaning. For hopeful young people, peace is life.

Everywhere in the world, mothers who have lost their children, displaced people, and all people who long for security in order to progress, are all sending out a unified call: "Peace." From bomb-damaged London to the wharves of New Zealand and Australia, from factories in India to factories in Japan, the call is the same. Everyone's hope is the same hope.

Rewi Alley continued: In such a situation, the meeting of many representatives from Asian and Pacific countries in Beijing in June this year to discuss the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was a historically significant step. These representatives discussed ways to unite their people to strive for peace. They expressed their views on the threats to peace. They armed themselves with facts so that they could better fight for peace. Then they returned to their own countries to prepare for the next step. At the great conference to be held in Beijing this autumn, we will see the results of their work, and this conference will further advance their work. Participating in this conference will be delegations from many countries, many races, and with various beliefs, people with different political views and different backgrounds, but who are willing to come to the meeting because they realize that the cause of peace is worth every effort and sacrifice, people who trust the call issued by the Preparatory Committee. The peace movement is an unadulterated people's movement. Its foundation is the most solid—the desire for peace, which is now the first element people need to continue to move forward.

When talking about the significance of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, Alley said: This conference is not an international court that attempts to resolve individual disputes, nor is it an official body that pretends to be able to solve all problems. It is an organization that promotes true understanding and sympathy among people, that wants to clear away some of the filth of fascism and other fascist theories, let fresh air and light enter everyone's consciousness, and give peace a richer meaning—giving the peace movement greater strength.

Rewi Alley also said: There is no doubt that we will all learn something from each other, and when we leave, we will know a lot and be greatly encouraged. There are many puddles on the road to peace that need to be drained, and these puddles may be deeply hidden in the minds of some people. Peace warriors must use all the weapons they can get to deal with these difficulties. If this great conference can provide many such weapons for everyone to use—whether in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Indonesia, Burma, or all our beloved different countries with colored people—then the conference's achievements will even be greater than the achievements expected by its most enthusiastic initiators.

Rewi Alley finally enthusiastically praised the achievements of New China, saying: On the way to and from Beijing, the representatives will see a vibrant and determined China, a China that has undergone amazing changes in the three years since liberation. The China they will see is a force for peace and construction; a China that is working in an organized, planned, and scientific way; a steel-like China where the people are masters and will no longer bow to any plundering groups; a civilized China that extends warmth and friendship to those who come with friendship and sincerity—a China that, together with all great countries striving for peace, is one of the leaders in the future human world. The most precious hope of the vast Chinese people is to strive for lasting peace. We can see the expression of this hope everywhere in China.

    迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    新西兰人民选出筹备委员准备推选代表团
    新西兰代表路易·艾黎热烈赞扬新中国的建设成就
    【新华社二十六日讯】在新西兰，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开已引起广大人民的注意。新西兰和平理事会秘书蒙太施已被推为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议新西兰筹备委员，他最近致函北京的筹备委员会说：他们相信能够选出一个广泛性的，包括各阶层人民的代表团来北京出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    【新华社二十六日讯】出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的新西兰代表路易·艾黎最近发表题为“和平的新步骤——亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”的文章，内中谈到召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的重要意义。他说：今天，全世界人民都要求和平和美好的生活。可是，战争却正在进行，平民被屠杀，为了扩军，人民缴纳了空前未有的重税，科学被人用来发明大规模毁灭人类的新武器。我们在朝鲜看见断手缺足的残废儿童，在美国也看见在投弹试验中缩在课桌底下吓得发抖的儿童。尽管有这些事实，“和平”仍然是所有语言中最得人心的字眼。没有和平，人类所需要的其他东西就不可能具有充分的意义。对于满怀着希望的青年们说来，和平就是生命。
    在世界各地，失去了孩子的母亲们、流离失所的人们、渴望得到保障以求进步的一切人们，大家都发出了一致的呼声：“和平”。从被炸弹破坏了的伦敦到新西兰和澳大利亚的码头，从印度的工厂到日本的工厂，这种呼声是一样的。大家的希望是同一个希望。
    路易·艾黎接着说：在这样的情况下，来自亚洲国家及太平洋国家的许多代表在今年六月份在北京聚会讨论了召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的事宜，这是一个具有历史意义的步骤。这些代表讨论了使他们的人民团结起来争取和平的办法。他们表示了他们对和平所受到的威胁的看法。他们以事实武装了自己，以使自己能够更好地为和平而斗争。然后他们回到他们自己的国家去准备下一个步骤。今年秋天即将在北京召开的伟大的会议上，我们将看见他们的工作成绩，这次会议又将把他们的工作更向前推进一步。参加这次会议的将有许多国家，许多种族，和有各种信仰的代表团，将有政治见解不同，背景不同，但是由于他们认识到和平事业值得付出一切努力和忍受一切牺牲，因而愿意前来开会的人们，将是信任筹备会议发出的号召的人们。和平运动是一个不折不扣的人民运动。它的基础就是现在人们要想继续前进的第一要素——对和平的愿望。这种基础是最巩固的。
    艾黎谈到亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的意义时说：这次会议不是企图解决个别纠纷的国际法院，不是一个装扮得很像是可以解决一切问题的官方机关。它是促进人们真正了解和同情的一个组织，它要清除法西斯主义和其他的法西斯理论的一些污秽，让新鲜空气和光线进入各人的意识，使和平得到更丰富的意义——给和平运动更大的力量。
    路易·艾黎又说：毫无疑问，我们都会彼此学得一些东西，在我们离开时，我们知道得很多，并且会得到很大的鼓励。在通往和平的道路上有许多水坑需要汲干，这些水坑或许就深深地藏在某些人们的思想里面。和平战士们必须以他们能够得到的一切武器去对付这些困难，如果这次伟大的会议能够提供很多这样的武器给大家使用——无论是在哥斯达黎加，危地马拉，印尼，缅甸或所有我们亲爱的不同的有色人种国家——那么，这次会议的成就甚至将比它的最热心的发起人所期望的成就还要大。
    路易·艾黎最后热烈赞扬新中国的成就说：在来往北京的途中，代表们将看见一个生气勃勃的、坚定的中国，一个在解放后的三年中有了惊人改变的中国。他们将看见的中国是和平和建设的力量；是一个正在以有组织、有计划的科学方式工作着的中国；是一个人民当了主人、不会再向任何掠夺集团屈膝的钢铁似的中国；是一个向那些带着友谊和诚意前来的人们伸出热情和友谊之手的文明的中国——是一个和所有争取和平的伟大国家一起、作为未来人类世界中的领袖之一的中国。中国广大人民最宝贵的希望是争取持久的和平。我们在中国任何地方，都可以见到这种希望的流露。
