Xinhua News Agency, August 18th—The China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) held a national organizational propaganda work reporting meeting in Beijing on August 5th, which successfully concluded on August 14th. The meeting mainly exchanged views on three issues: the nature and tasks of the Association, the organizational line, and ideological remolding, and submitted suggestions to the Central Standing Committee. The meeting also discussed some specific issues related to the Association's work.

The meeting determined that the nature of the China Association for Promoting Democracy is: "a united front of new democratic political parties with petty-bourgeois intellectuals as its main component." The task of the Association is to unite the masses around it under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to carry out self-education and self-remolding so that they can actively participate in the construction of the new China. The meeting held that in order to better unite, educate, and remold the masses with whom it is connected, it should correctly represent their legitimate demands (i.e., those that conform to the Common Program) and assist the government in implementing policies.

The meeting determined that the future development targets of the China Association for Promoting Democracy should be educators, cultural publishing workers, science and technology workers, medical and health workers, and government employees, with a focus on primary and secondary school teachers and staff and cultural publishing workers.

Regarding the standards for the ideological remolding of members, the meeting held that the Common Program should be the unified yardstick, but the unified yardstick is not a limit, and anyone can continue to move forward according to their own determination and efforts. Members are willing to arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought on a voluntary basis, and the Association's organization should encourage and help them.

Xu Guangping, Secretary-General of the China Association for Promoting Democracy headquarters, gave a report on organizational and propaganda work over the past year at the meeting, and Lin Handa, Minister of the Organization Department, gave a concluding report on the meeting. Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman, gave speeches at the opening and closing sessions respectively.

During the meeting, Xu Bing, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, and Hu Sheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, both gave reports, providing many opinions on the issues discussed at the meeting.

    民主促进会开全国组织宣教工作汇报会议
    着重讨论了会的性质任务、组织路线及思想改造等问题
    【新华社十八日讯】中国民主促进会全国组织宣教工作汇报会议八月五日在北京召开，已于八月十四日胜利闭幕。这次会议主要针对会的性质任务、组织路线及思想改造等三个问题交换了意见，并向中央常务理事会提出了建议。会议又讨论了一些有关会务的具体问题。
    会议认为民主促进会的性质是：“以小资产阶级知识分子为主要成分的统一战线的新民主主义的政治党派”。会的任务就是要在中国共产党领导下，团结周围所联系的群众来进行自我教育和自我改造，使能积极参加新中国的建设事业。会议认为：为了更好地团结、教育、改造所联系的群众，应该正确地代表他们的正当要求（即符合于共同纲领的要求），协助政府，贯彻政策。
    会议认为：民主促进会今后发展的对象应是教育工作者、文化出版工作者、科学技术工作者、医药卫生工作者、机关工作者等，而以中小学教职员和文化出版工作者为主。
    关于会员思想改造的标准，会议认为应以共同纲领为统一的尺度，但统一的尺度不是限度，任何人都可以按照自己的决心和努力，继续前进。会员在自觉的基础上，愿以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装自己，会的组织应当予以鼓励和帮助。
    中国民主促进会总部秘书长许广平曾在会上作了一年来组织、宣教工作报告，组织部部长林汉达作了会议的总结报告。民主促进会主席马叙伦、副主席王绍鏊分别在开幕及闭幕会上作了讲话。
    会议期间，中共中央统战部副部长徐冰及中共中央宣传部副秘书长胡绳都作了报告，对于会议所讨论的问题提供了许多意见。
