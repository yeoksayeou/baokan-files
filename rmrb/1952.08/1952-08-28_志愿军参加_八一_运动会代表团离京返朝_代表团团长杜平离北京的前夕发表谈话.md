Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, invited back to the country to participate in the 25th Anniversary Sports Meet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Army Day, have left Beijing in batches on the 22nd and 26th to return to the Korean front. Representatives from the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, the Beijing Branch of the Resist America and Aid Korea Committee, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education, and Beijing People's Organizations went to the station to see them off.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Du Ping, the leader of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation invited back to the country to participate in the 25th Anniversary Sports Meet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Army Day, gave a speech to our agency's reporter on the eve of his departure from Beijing to return to the Korean front.

Delegation Leader Du Ping said: The "August 1st" Sports Meet has given our Volunteer Army delegation rich learning content. From the various competitions, performances, and exhibitions of the conference, we have seen the significant achievements of the People's Liberation Army in cultural learning, sports, military technology, and literary and artistic activities. PLA athletes have created six national records since liberation; various literary and artistic troupes have performed many excellent literary and artistic programs that implement the policy of serving the soldiers and have combat and mass characteristics; many troops have eliminated illiteracy and launched a major advance in cultural and scientific knowledge. All of this powerfully demonstrates that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a powerful force with high cultural attainments and a healthy physique, and shows the tremendous efforts made by the People's Liberation Army to defend national construction and world peace.

Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army must vigorously develop cultural and sports activities in the troops, improve military technology, and strengthen modern military construction in order to better undertake and complete the glorious tasks of defending the motherland, defending world peace, and defeating the US imperialist aggressors. Therefore, we must strive to learn the spirit of the "August 1st" Sports Meet, and learn from the collectivism and revolutionary heroism of the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who study diligently, practice hard, unite and help each other, and overcome difficulties. We must deeply spread this spirit to the broad commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army, and launch a wide-ranging learning movement in the front and rear, in the mountains and forests, in the tunnels and fortifications, so that combat and learning are combined, and sports and military training are combined, to further enhance the combat power to strike against the American aggressors.

Delegation Leader Du Ping described the excited mood of the Volunteer Army delegation representatives after seeing the great achievements of the motherland's various constructions. He said: After we returned to the country, we personally saw that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the motherland have displayed a high degree of initiative and unparalleled creativity in creating their own happy lives and defending world peace, and have achieved brilliant results in various constructions. The people of the motherland have not only enthusiastically launched the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, and fully supported our Volunteer Army's victorious operations on the Korean battlefield, but also realized Chairman Mao's instructions ahead of schedule, and strived for a fundamental improvement in the country's economic situation, laying a solid foundation for the motherland's large-scale construction in the future. The beautiful and happy future of the great motherland has been brilliantly displayed in front of the people of the whole country, which is the greatest encouragement and support for our Volunteer Army, and has infinitely enhanced our fighting will and fighting power. At present, the US aggressors are still delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, maintaining international tensions; and are continuing to expand their armaments, stepping up the arming of Japan and West Germany, and actively preparing to expand the war of aggression. However, we have seen the rapid growth of the motherland's strength, and our confidence in defeating all the enemy's conspiracies is growing stronger and stronger. We will fight to the final victory for a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue, and for the defense of the motherland, the defense of the Far East and world peace.

Delegation Leader Du Ping, on behalf of all the representatives of the Volunteer Army delegation, expressed deep gratitude to the people of the motherland, the people of the capital, and the People's Liberation Army for their warm reception, and for the honorary awards given to the Volunteer Army delegation for their literary and artistic programs and sports events at the "August 1st" Sports Meet.

    志愿军参加“八一”运动会代表团离京返朝
    代表团团长杜平离北京的前夕发表谈话
    【新华社二十七日讯】应邀归国参加中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会的中国人民志愿军代表团代表，已于二十二日和二十六日分批离开北京返回朝鲜前线。先后前往车站欢送者，有中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部、中国人民抗美援朝总会、北京市抗美援朝分会、北京市人民政府文教局、北京市人民团体等代表。
    【新华社二十七日讯】应邀归国参加中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会的中国人民志愿军代表团杜平团长于离开北京返回朝鲜前线前夕，对本社记者发表谈话。
    杜平团长说：“八一”体育运动大会给了我们志愿军代表团丰富的学习内容。从大会的各项竞赛、表演和展览中，我们看到了人民解放军在文化学习、体育运动、军事技术和文艺活动等方面的重大成就。解放军运动员创造了六项解放后全国的最高纪录；各个文艺代表队表演了许多优秀的、贯彻了为兵服务方针的、具有战斗性和群众性特色的文艺节目；许多部队已经消除了文盲，展开了文化科学知识的大进军。所有这些，都有力地说明了中国人民解放军是一支具有高度文化素养和健壮体魄的强大的部队，显示了人民解放军为保卫祖国建设，保卫世界和平所作的巨大努力。
    我们人民志愿军为了更好地担负和完成保卫祖国、保卫世界和平、打败美帝国主义侵略者的光荣任务，必须大力开展部队文化体育运动，提高军事技术，加强现代化的军事建设。因此我们要努力学习“八一”体育运动大会的精神，学习人民解放军指挥员、战斗员们勤学苦练、团结互助、克服困难的集体主义和革命英雄主义的精神。我们要把这种精神深入地传播到志愿军广大指挥员、战斗员中去，在前方和后方、山野和深林、坑道和工事中，展开一个广泛的学习运动，使战斗和学习结合起来、体育运动和练兵结合起来，进一步增强打击美国侵略者的战斗力量。
    杜平团长叙述了志愿军归国代表团代表们看到祖国各项建设的伟大成就后的兴奋心情。他说：我们归国之后，都亲眼看到在毛主席英明领导下，祖国人民为创造自己的幸福生活和保卫世界和平，发挥了高度的积极性和无比的创造性，获得了各项建设的辉煌成绩。祖国人民不但热烈地开展了抗美援朝运动，全力支援了我们志愿军在朝鲜战场的胜利作战，而且提前实现了毛主席的指示，争取了国家经济情况的根本好转，为祖国今后大规模建设打下了稳固的基础。伟大祖国的美好幸福的前途，已灿烂地展现在全国人民的面前，这对我们志愿军是一个最大的鼓舞和支持，使我们无限地增强了战斗意志和战斗力量。目前，美国侵略者还在拖延朝鲜停战谈判，保持国际间的紧张局势；并在继续扩充军备、加紧武装日本和西德，积极地准备扩大侵略战争。但是，我们看到祖国力量在迅速壮大，我们打败敌人一切阴谋的胜利信心就越来越提高。我们将为争取公平合理地解决朝鲜问题，为保卫祖国，保卫远东与世界和平而战斗到最后胜利。
    杜平团长代表志愿军归国代表团全体代表，对祖国人民、首都人民和人民解放军的热情招待，“八一”体育运动大会给予志愿军代表团的文艺节目和体育项目以荣誉奖励表示深切感谢。
