    New Methods to Shorten Mail Delivery Time
    Comrade Editor: Xue Shenxiu, a mail carrier from the 12th Branch of the Beijing Post Office, has created a "fast delivery method" that reduces the average delivery speed for regular, registered, and printed mail from 103 seconds per household to 26 seconds per household. The average delivery speed for newspapers has been reduced from 41 seconds per household to 18 seconds per household.
    The characteristics of Xue Shenxiu's "fast delivery method" are mainly: establishing close ties with the masses through daily preparation work, and shortening delivery time as much as possible. Following the principle of "voluntariness," he has agreed on different signals with recipients based on whether they are "doorbell households," "deep courtyard households," or "shallow courtyard households." He agreed with "doorbell households" that one ring means regular mail; two rings mean a newspaper; and three rings mean registered mail. The recipient immediately comes out to collect the mail upon hearing the doorbell; if they hear the registered mail ring, they bring their stamp to collect the mail. He also agreed on different methods with "deep courtyard households" and "shallow courtyard households." As a result, the delivery time has been greatly shortened.

    缩短邮件投递时间的新方法
    编辑同志：北京邮局第十二支局邮递员薛慎修，创造了“快速投递法”，投递平常、挂号、印刷邮件的平均速度由一百零三秒一户缩短到二十六秒一户。投递报纸的平均速度由四十一秒一户缩短到十八秒一户。
    薛慎修“快速投递法”的特点主要是：通过日常的准备工作，和群众取得密切联系，尽量缩短投递时间。并遵循“自愿”的原则，根据“电铃户”、“深院户”、“浅院户”的不同情况，和收件人约定了不同的信号。和“电铃户”约定：按一下电铃，就是平常信；按两下电铃是报纸；按三下电铃就是挂号信。收件人听到电铃声音，立即出来取邮件；如果听到挂号信的铃声，就带着图章出来取信。和“深院户”、“浅院户”也分别约定了办法。因而大大缩短了投递时间。
