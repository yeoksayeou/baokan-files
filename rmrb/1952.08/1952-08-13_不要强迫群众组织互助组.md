    Do Not Force the Masses to Organize Mutual Aid Teams
    Comrade Editor: Cadres from Duan Wanglianzi Village, Liaocheng County, Pingyuan Province, returned from a meeting in the district and made two green hats out of paper. They held a mass meeting in the evening, and the cadres said, "We must all organize to cooperate in production. Whoever does not obey will wear this green hat." The masses all said, "No objections, we will obey the assignment." That's how the village was organized for production. Of course, everyone's production enthusiasm was not high. Some were scrambling to do their own work, some were not putting in effort when working for others, and some felt that they had cattle and farm tools and would be at a disadvantage to cooperate with others. These people were either arguing or causing trouble, and two groups have already disbanded. Forcing the masses to cooperate in this way not only fails to achieve the goal of increasing production, but also hinders production and leaves a bad impression on the masses. I hope that this village will quickly correct this commandist work style, and I suggest that all localities pay attention to and check this situation when organizing mutual aid and cooperation.

    不要强迫群众组织互助组
    编辑同志：平原省聊城县段王连子村的干部从区里开会回来，就用纸糊了两顶绿帽子。晚上开了群众会，干部说：“我们大家要组织起来互助合作生产，谁不服从，谁就戴戴这顶绿帽子。”群众都说：“没意见，服从分配。”这村就这样组织起来生产了。当然，大家的生产情绪都不高。有的争着干自己活，有的给人家干活不用力气，有的认为自己有牛有农具，和人合作是吃亏了。这些人不是吵嘴，就是闹别扭，现已散了两组。这样强迫群众互助合作，不但不能达到提高生产的目的，反而阻碍了生产，还给群众留下坏的影响。我希望这个村迅速纠正这种强迫命令的工作作风，并建议各地在组织互助合作时注意和检查这种情况。张民生
