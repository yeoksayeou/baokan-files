    Determined to be a Servant of the People
    Comrade Editor: After reading the "Decision on Labor Employment Issues" of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government, I was extremely excited. I am a housewife living in Beijing, and also a mother of five children. I have a high school education, but for the past twenty years or so, under the rule of the reactionaries in the old society, I couldn't find a job because I didn't have any special "connections," and I lived a parasitic life at home. I felt ashamed of this, but there was nothing I could do. I never expected that the Communist Party would come, we would be liberated, and today the government is considering our employment issues, giving us housewives, who were never valued in the past, the opportunity to come out and serve the people. How exciting this is! I am preparing myself, I will devote all my energy to wholeheartedly being a loyal and honest servant of the people.

    决心做一个人民勤务员
    编辑同志：看了中央人民政府政务院“关于劳动就业问题的决定”，我万分兴奋。我是住在北京的一个家庭妇女，也是有了五个孩子的母亲。我有着高中的文化程度，但二十几年来，在反动派统治的旧社会里，因为我没有特别“门路”而找不到职业，一直在家庭里过着寄生式的生活。对此，感到可耻，但又无可如何。万没想到，共产党来了，我们解放了，今天政府又考虑到我们的就业问题，使我们这些过去一向不被人重视的家庭妇女，也有机会出来为人民服务。这是多么令人兴奋的事！我准备着，我将拿出我所有的精力来全心全意地做一个忠诚老实的人民勤务员。  薛泽晖
