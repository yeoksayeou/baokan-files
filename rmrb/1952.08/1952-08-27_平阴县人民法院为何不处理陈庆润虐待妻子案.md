    Why Doesn't Pingyin County People's Court Handle Chen Qingrun's Wife Abuse Case?
    Comrade Editor: Chen Li, a woman from Xiguadian Village, Pingyin County, Shandong Province, is thirty-three years old this year. She married Chen Qingrun of the same village thirteen years ago. The couple had a good relationship after their marriage. Now they have two boys, one eight years old and the other five years old, and a girl less than one year old. After Chen Qingrun committed adultery with another married woman in 1948, his heart changed. He constantly beat and scolded Chen Li, and did not engage in production, eating and drinking lavishly every day. Chen Li led the children to farm, and even with all the work, they often did not have enough to eat. Chen Li spoke to the village cadres, but they did not care; she spoke to her parents-in-law, but they also said they could not manage it. When Chen Li returned to her parents' home, her mother also advised her: "Just endure it!" In such circumstances, Chen Li felt that there was no way out. One night in June last year, Chen Li drank a cup of kerosene that had been used to soak five boxes of matches to commit suicide. After drinking it, Chen Li looked at her three sleeping children and thought of their suffering in the hands of a stepmother. Then she took the two older children and threw herself into a water pit. After being discovered, the two children had already died, and Chen Li was rescued by a doctor. After this, the village cadres instructed the masses: "If the higher-level government comes to investigate, say that the children fell into the water pit and drowned themselves, and the adults went down to rescue the children." They gave Chen Li the same instruction, saying, "Otherwise you will pay with your life."
    After I learned about this situation, I thought that this was caused by Chen Li's low awareness, not understanding policies and laws, and not knowing how to rely on the People's Government to solve the problem, which caused this tragic event; this event should be used to educate the masses. In July last year, I submitted a written appeal to the County People's Court about this situation. However, the court has not taken any action. Chen Li spends every day in tears, and even wants to commit suicide again. In May this year, I urged the relevant cadres in the district and county, and the reply was that "it will be dealt with soon." However, three months have passed, and it still has not been dealt with. I request the relevant higher authorities to order the County People's Court to handle the matter promptly, and to investigate the reasons for the delay in handling it during the judicial reform movement.

    平阴县人民法院为何不处理陈庆润虐待妻子案
    编辑同志：山东省平阴县西瓜店村妇女陈李氏，今年三十三岁，十三年前和同村陈庆润结婚。婚后夫妇感情还好，现在有两个男孩，大的八岁，小的五岁，和一个不到一岁的女孩。陈庆润在一九四八年和另一已婚的女人通奸后，就变了心，不断打骂陈李氏，也不事生产，每天大吃大喝。陈李氏领着孩子种地，忙来忙去还常常吃不饱。陈李氏向村干部说，村干部不管；向公婆说，公婆也表示无法管。陈李氏回娘家时，娘也劝她：“熬着吧！”在这样情况下，陈李氏感到已经没有生路。去年六月间的一个晚上，陈李氏便喝了一杯泡过五盒火柴的煤油自杀。喝后，陈李氏又看看正睡着的三个孩子，并想到孩子落在继母手中的苦楚，于是她便带着大的两个孩子一同投入水坑。被人发觉后，两个孩子已经死去，陈李氏经医生救活。这以后，村干部向群众布置：“如果上级政府来调查，就说小孩是自己掉到水坑里淹死的，大人是为捞小孩下去的。”对陈李氏也同样布置，并说“不然你得偿命”。
    我知道这情况后，想到这是由于陈李氏觉悟低，不懂政策法令，不知依靠人民政府解决问题，才造成这惨痛事件；应该通过处理这一事件，教育群众。去年七月，我便把这一情况书面向该县人民法院申诉。但该院一直未作处理。陈李氏每天用眼泪过日子，甚至又想自杀。今年五月，我又向该区、县有关干部催促，答复说是“就要处理”。但三个月过去了，到现在仍然没处理。我要求有关上级责成该县人民法院迅速处理，并在司法改革运动中检查拖延处理的原因。李泽民
