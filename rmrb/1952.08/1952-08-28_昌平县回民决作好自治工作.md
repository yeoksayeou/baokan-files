    Changping County Hui People Resolve to Do a Good Job in Autonomous Work

    Editor: We, the representatives of the Hui People's United Association of Changping County, Hebei Province, support the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" and related decisions published in the People's Daily on August 13th and 14th. Before liberation, our Hui people had been under the rule and oppression of feudal forces and reactionaries, which resulted in our backwardness in political, cultural, and economic aspects. Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we have been liberated and gained true freedom. Recently, after seeing the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" and related decisions, all the Hui people in the county are even more jubilant. From now on, all the Hui people in the county will work harder in production and study, respond to all calls of the People's Government, do a good job in the autonomous work of the Hui people, and strive to strengthen the unity among fraternal ethnic groups, in order to thank Chairman Mao for his concern and love for our minority nationalities.

    昌平县回民决作好自治工作
    编辑同志：我们河北省昌平县回民联合总会代表全县回民拥护八月十三、十四日人民日报刊载的
    “中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”及有关决定。解放前，我们回民一直受着封建势力和反动派的统治、压迫，以致我们在政治、文化、经济各方面都很落后。在我们伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，我们才得到了解放，得到了真正的自由。最近，当我们看到“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”及有关决定后，全县回民更是欢欣鼓舞。今后，全县回民当更加努力生产、努力学习，响应人民政府一切号召，并作好回民自治工作及努力加强兄弟民族间的团结，以答谢毛主席对我们少数民族的关心和爱护。　　　　河北省昌平县回民联合总会
