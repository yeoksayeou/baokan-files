Two Issues School Administrators Should Pay Attention to When Implementing the Five-Year Elementary School System
    —Experiences from Six Five-Year Elementary School Experimental Classes in Beijing
  　Tu Zhongshun
    The five-year elementary school system will be implemented in the fall of 1952. Here, based solely on the experiences of the six five-year elementary school experimental classes in Beijing, I want to point out two issues that schools should pay attention to in administration, for reference by elementary schools across the country when implementing the five-year system.
    First, attention must be paid to ideological leadership.
    When experimenting with the five-year elementary school system in Beijing, most teachers felt that this task was glorious and were happy to accept it. However, in general, the understanding of this task was insufficient. It was not closely linked to the interests of the entire working people and the country's various construction undertakings. It was not recognized that the implementation of the five-year elementary school system is a reflection of our country's New Democratic education policy. Therefore, it was regarded as the work of a few teachers in the experimental class, as the glory of a few individuals. In addition, some school administrative departments did not pay enough attention to this, and did not promptly understand the teachers' thoughts, thereby failing to grasp ideological leadership. As a result, some schools did not transform it into a collective task for all members of the school, and failed to mobilize the collective power to complete this task. This time, the experimental work in Beijing gained a very profound lesson in this regard: schools where the administration paid attention to ideological leadership saw smoother work, while the opposite was true. For example, at the First Central Elementary School in the Sixth District of Beijing, for a long time after the experimental class was established, the school administration did not give enough attention to the experimental work. Therefore, although the teachers worked hard, it was only individual efforts, and they could not form an organized force. Other teachers, although wanting to help the experimental class, felt that they did not know where to start. The teaching and life guidance experience gained by the teachers in the experimental class did not attract the attention of other classes and did not have the due influence on them. However, at the Second Central Elementary School in the Third District of Beijing, because the principal and the director of teaching affairs paid special attention to this issue from the beginning, after accepting this task, they conducted a relatively in-depth mobilization among all teachers, repeatedly explaining the importance of the curriculum reform of the five-year elementary school system. Principal Chen Junping also told everyone about the fact that children of farmers in the old liberated areas generally had the opportunity to smoothly enter higher education, which greatly encouraged all teachers, making each teacher feel a glorious sense of responsibility for this work. Later, after enlightenment and deliberation, and discussions by the Party and Youth League groups, through a democratic method combining leadership and the masses, people with teaching talent and experience were carefully selected to undertake this work. When the list of these teachers was announced, a general assembly of all teachers was held. The elected teachers made guarantees at the meeting, and through the speeches of many people, a good education was conducted for all teachers, making everyone feel the glory of this work, and also consolidating the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the elected teachers. In this way, every teacher in the school would not adopt an indifferent attitude towards the experimental work, and the teachers participating in the experimental work would not feel lonely and lack courage.
    When the experimental work began, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government organized an experimental work committee including the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, the principals and directors of teaching affairs of six schools, and the Chinese and arithmetic textbook compilation committees. It also convened a symposium on life guidance for lower grade children, and hired Soviet experts to hold elementary education lectures twice a week. In the second semester, it also mobilized the six schools to jointly organize teaching and research groups in various subjects, extensively organized the experimental class teachers, and promoted them to learn from each other in an organized manner and to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in an organized manner. This played a great role in researching and solving problems, and enabled teachers to establish confidence in this work.
    When the five-year elementary school system is promoted nationwide, because administrative leaders at all levels lack experience, teachers are not sufficiently prepared ideologically, the teaching syllabus has not yet been issued, and there are still many problems to be studied in teaching methods and life guidance, this may affect teachers' confidence. However, the experimental experience of the six elementary schools in Beijing can prove that the above problems are not unsolvable. When the six elementary schools in Beijing started the experiment, there were also many difficulties, but through efforts, all the difficulties were basically overcome, and certain achievements were made. According to our experience, as long as we establish a high degree of confidence, use revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to solve problems, resolutely rely on the masses, use all possible forces to mobilize, and pay attention to ideological leadership, then any difficulty can be overcome and any problem can be solved.
    Second, attention should be paid to selecting and cultivating teachers, and implementing the system of homeroom teachers following the class as much as possible.
    According to the experience of the experimental classes of the six elementary schools in Beijing, the most important condition for selecting teachers is to require teachers to have a certain political level. In addition to paying attention to political conditions, teachers with teaching experience in lower, middle, and upper grades should also be selected separately so that they can help each other based on their existing experience. However, the first class should preferably select teachers who are relatively good in all aspects, so as to make it the focus of a certain place or school, and accumulate experience for future work.
    Cultivating and improving teachers, and leading teachers to study, must simultaneously emphasize politics, professional skills, and culture, with improving political and ideological level as the main key, and should be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. It is also necessary to criticize the viewpoint of teachers who simply value professional skills and do not care about politics at any time. Because if such a viewpoint exists among teachers, it is easy to create pride, complacency, individualism, detachment from the masses, and mutual disunity; it will not only fail to improve professional skills and fail to fulfill the responsibilities that people's teachers should fulfill, but will also leave a bad influence on colleagues and children.
    The issue of homeroom teachers following the class may still be hesitant or feel difficult for some people. In fact, it is not only a workable system, but also an excellent teaching system that fully conforms to the New Democratic education policy. It enables teachers to truly be fully responsible for children, and enables children to receive all-round development education. The experience of the experimental classes in the six elementary schools in Beijing has provided strong proof for this point. Wang Qi, the director of teaching affairs of the Second Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University, said:
    "The teachers of the experimental class know the personality and characteristics of each child in their class very well, so they can earnestly try to help children overcome their shortcomings and cultivate their excellent character. These are all the benefits of implementing the homeroom teacher following the class system." We affirm that the system of homeroom teachers following the class is the direction of our future elementary school teaching system and must be implemented. Therefore, teachers should be determined to study hard and not limit themselves to teaching the subjects of a certain grade or two grades, so that their professional level will not improve. The system of homeroom teachers following the class can also prevent teachers from adopting an objectivist attitude towards students, thinking that they can only teach children for one or two years, and they can ignore their future development.
    In some areas, the quality of elementary school teachers is relatively low, and there may be some difficulties in implementing the teaching system of homeroom teachers following the class. However, as long as the school administration seizes the time, leads teachers to study in a planned manner, and improves their political and professional levels, the quality of teachers can be improved. As for the concern that not changing teachers for several years may affect children due to a teacher's shortcomings, as long as we strengthen political study, carry out ideological transformation movements, and master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, the problem is entirely possible to solve. Naturally, when the conditions for teachers are not mature, the teaching system of homeroom teachers following the class can be postponed; but it must be affirmed that this is an excellent system, and we must work hard in this direction.
    Now, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government is concentrating outstanding teachers and experts from all over the country to prepare the teaching syllabus. The People's Education Press also guarantees to complete the two textbooks of Chinese and arithmetic within two years. The teaching materials for the remaining subjects are also being organized to find solutions. In addition, major cities across the country have provided some valuable experience for new teaching methods in the work of experimenting with the five-year elementary school system. These preparations have created many conditions favorable for promoting this new school system. Elementary school teachers across the country, we should welcome the reform of the elementary school system with great excitement, and promote its smooth realization with a hundredfold confidence. We firmly believe that with everyone's joint efforts, we will definitely be able to create more valuable experience with a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods, overcome difficulties, and complete the glorious and arduous task entrusted to us by the motherland.

    推行小学五年一贯制时学校行政应注意的两个问题
    ——北京市六个小学五年一贯制实验班的经验
  　屠忠顺
    一九五二年秋季将开始推行小学五年一贯制，这里我想仅就北京市六个小学五年一贯制实验班的经验，举出学校行政上应该注意的两个问题，以供各地小学实施五年一贯制时的参考。
    第一、必须注意思想领导。
    北京市在实验小学五年一贯制时，大多数的教师都感觉这个任务是光荣的，都乐于接受这一任务。但一般对这一任务认识不足，没有把它和整个劳动人民的利益和国家的各项建设事业紧密地联系起来；没有认识到小学五年一贯制的实施，是我们国家新民主主义教育政策的体现，因而把它看成是实验班几个教师的工作，看成是少数几个人的光荣。加上有些学校行政方面，对此没有足够的重视，没有及时摸清教师思想，从而抓紧思想领导，致使有些学校，就没有把它变成学校所有成员集体的任务，没有发动集体的力量去完成这一任务。这次北京市的实验工作，在这一点上，获得了一个极深刻的教训：学校行政注意了思想领导的，工作就顺利些，反之，困难就多些。比如北京市第六区第一中心小学，自开办实验班后一个长时间内，学校行政上没有对实验工作予以足够的重视，因此教师虽然努力，但也只是个别的努力，不能形成有组织的力量。其他的教师虽想对实验班予以帮助，也感觉无从下手。而实验班教师钻研所得到的教学和生活指导方面的经验，也没有引起其它各班的注意，并对各班发生应有的影响。可是北京市第三区第二中心小学，因为开始时校长和教导主任就特别注意了这个问题，所以在接受这一任务后，他们就在全体教师中进行了比较深入的动员，再三说明小学五年一贯制实验课程改革的重要。校长陈君平同志并把他在老解放区所看到的农民子女普遍获得顺利升学机会的事实告诉大家，给全体教师很大的鼓舞，使每个教师对这一工作都有一种光荣的责任感。以后又经过启发、酝酿，党和青年团小组的讨论，通过领导和群众相结合的民主方法，慎重地选择了有教学才干和教学经验的人来担任这一工作。公布这些教师的名单的时候，又举行了全体教师大会，当选的教师在大会上提出了保证，通过许多人的发言，对全体教师进行了一次很好的教育，使大家都感到这一工作的光荣，同时也巩固了当选教师的热情和责任感。这样，全校个个教师都不会对实验工作采取漠不关心的态度，而参加实验工作的教师也不会感到孤单，缺乏勇气。
    当实验工作开始时，中央人民政府教育部曾组织了包括北京市文教局、六个学校校长、教导主任的实验工作委员会及语文、算术教材编选委员会。又曾召集关于低年级儿童生活指导问题的座谈会，并聘请苏联专家举行两周一次的小学教育讲座。到了第二学期，又发动六校联合组织各科教学研究组，把实验班教师广泛地组织起来，推动他们有组织地相互学习，有组织地学习苏联的先进经验。这样做，对研究、解决问题，起了很大的作用，使教师们建立了对这一工作的信心。
    小学五年一贯制在全国范围内推行时，因为各级行政领导缺乏经验，教师思想准备不够，教学大纲还未颁发，教学方法、生活指导等方面也都还有许多问题须待研究，这就可能影响教师们的信心。但北京市六个小学的实验经验，可以证明上述的问题并不是不能解决的。北京市六个小学开始实验时，困难也是很多的，但经过努力，所有的困难基本上都克服了，而且获得了一定的成绩。根据我们的经验，只要建立高度的信心，以革命的精神、革命的办法来解决问题，坚决依靠群众，利用一切可能发动的力量，注意思想领导，那末，任何的困难都能克服，任何问题都能解决的。
    第二、应当注意选择、培养教师，并尽可能实行班主任跟班走的制度。
    根据北京市六个小学实验班的经验，选择教师，最重要的条件，是要求教师有一定的政治水平。除去应注意政治条件外，还应当分别选取具有低、中、高年级的教学经验的教师，使之根据已有经验，相互帮助。但最初的一班，最好选择各方面都比较优良的教师，以之作为某一地某一校的重点，为以后的工作积累经验。
    培养、提高教师，领导教师学习，必须政治、业务、文化三者同时并重，而以提高政治思想水平为主要关键，并应有计划、有步骤地进行。而且必须随时批判教师中的单纯重视业务而不问政治的观点。因为教师中如果存在有这样的观点，就容易造成骄傲自满、个人英雄主义、脱离群众、互相不团结的现象；不仅不能提高业务，不能很好地尽到人民教师应尽的责任，并将使这些旧思想、坏作风对同事对儿童都留下不良的影响。
    班主任跟班走问题，目前可能有些人还表示犹疑，或者感觉有困难。实际上它不仅是一个行得通的制度，而且是一个完全符合新民主主义教育方针的优良的教学制度。它使教师真正能做到对儿童全面负责，使儿童获得全面发展的教育。北京市六个小学实验班的经验，对这一点给了有力的证明。北京师范大学第二附属小学的教导主任汪琪同志说：
    “实验班的教师，对他们班上每一个孩子的个性、特点都摸得很熟，因此能够认真地设法帮助孩子们克服缺点，并培养孩子们优良的性格，这都是实行班主任跟班走的制度的好处。”我们肯定地说，班主任跟班走的制度，是我们将来的小学教学制度的方向，是一定要实行的。因此，教师们应当下定决心，努力学习，不要把自己限于只能教某一年级或某两个年级的功课，使业务水平老提不高。班主任跟班走的制度，还可以避免教师们对学生采取客观主义的态度，以为自己只能教孩子们一两年，以后他们的发展如何，可以不闻不问。
    有些地区小学教师的质量比较低，在实行班主任跟班走的教学制度时，可能有些困难。但只要学校行政上抓紧时间，有计划地领导教师进行学习，提高他们的政治水平和业务水平，教师的质量是可以提高的。至于认为几年不换教师，一个教师的缺点可能影响儿童，这种顾虑，只要加强政治学习，开展思想改造运动，掌握批评和自我批评的武器，问题也是完全有可能解决的。自然，在教师的条件不成熟的时候，班主任跟班走的教学制度可以暂缓施行；但必须肯定这是一种优良的制度，一定要向这方面努力。
    现在中央人民政府教育部正集中全国的优秀教师和专家们在编制教学大纲。人民教育出版社也保证要在两年内完成语文、算术两种课本。其余各科教材亦在组织力量设法解决。加上全国各大城市在实验小学五年一贯制的工作方面，对新的教学方法提供出了一些有价值的经验。这种种准备，给我们创造了很多有利于推行这一新学制的条件。全国小学教师同志们，我们应该以万分兴奋的心情来迎接小学学制的改革，并以百倍的信心促其顺利地实现。我们深信在大家共同努力之下，一定能以革命的精神、革命的办法创造出更多的更宝贵的经验，战胜困难，完成祖国付托给我们的光荣而艰巨的任务。
