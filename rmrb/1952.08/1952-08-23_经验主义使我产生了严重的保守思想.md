Empiricism Has Given Rise to My Serious Conservative Thought
Wang Wenbin, Deputy Director of Shijingshan Power Plant

The work of promoting advanced experience has promoted production reform in enterprises and has also helped cadres who manage enterprises to carry out ideological transformation. The Shijingshan Power Plant's learning of the Soviet advanced experience of burning low-value coal is a good start to transforming my conservative thinking.

I am of worker origin and have worked at the Shijingshan Power Plant for thirty-one years. After liberation, the Party promoted me to be the deputy director of the plant. Although I have worked very hard and wholeheartedly wanted to do my job well, because I often considered issues from the narrow experience of the past, my conservative thinking was quite serious. The Party has constantly educated me, but I have not corrected this shortcoming well. In the process of burning low-value coal, this conservative thinking was more concentratedly exposed.

From October of last year, the Shijingshan Power Plant intermittently conducted experiments on burning low-value coal, and officially began burning low-value coal during the Red May competition this year. From the time the suggestion of burning low-value coal was put forward to the time the Party's general branch committee made a decision, and even for a considerable period after the start of burning, I was always hesitant and lacked confidence, and I did not actively and proactively lead this work in the experiment. Because, based on past experience, I believed that this plant had tried to burn low-value coal several times during the Kuomintang and Japanese puppet rule due to other reasons, and all of them failed. Now that it is proposed to burn low-value coal again, the first thing I thought of was the lessons of past failures. I was worried that the ash content of low-value coal was too high, the heat content was very small, and after burning, it would not be possible to reach the rated output, and safe operation would also be affected. What if a power outage accident occurred? I ignored the great creative power of the awakened working class, especially after the "Three-Anti" movement, and I did not analyze the difference between today's factory and the past, and I did not pay attention to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Naturally, subjectively I did not despise the creativity of the workers, and I myself had had many creations. However, when considering problems, I first thought of my own experience, and whether things could be done often depended on past experience. This affected my ability to quickly and sharply accept advanced experience.

In addition, veteran workers sometimes accepted some fragmented theoretical knowledge from technicians and used it as the basis for their narrow experience. I myself was the same. This time, many technicians, based on their calculations and estimates, also believed that low-value coal could not be burned. These statements further fueled my conservative thinking. Therefore, when discussing burning low-value coal, I always thought that others were considering "cost" and I was considering "safety." Everyone had their own reasons, and no one could convince anyone else. In addition, I over-considered the difficulties and did not dare to boldly break through these difficulties, so I lacked even more confidence in the work of burning low-value coal.

In the process of burning low-value coal, the Party educated me in various ways. The Party had a very clear understanding of my shortcomings. The comrades of the general branch committee gradually helped me understand the great significance of burning low-value coal, helped me analyze the favorable conditions for today's production, pointed out the shortcomings of my way of thinking, and encouraged me to boldly take responsibility and gradually conduct experiments in a planned way. The Party also used various ways to help me solve various problems in the promotion work. From these inspirations and educations, my ideas gradually changed. After I understood the great significance of burning low-value coal, I no longer thought that the dispute between me and everyone was that you were calculating "cost" and I was talking about "safety"; at the same time, I also saw that many comrades immediately thought about how to overcome the difficulties after raising them, and what I often thought about was not how to overcome the difficulties, but just said that it could not be done, that is, retreating in the face of difficulties. Especially when the masses responded to the Party's call and took action, the problems were solved one by one, the difficulties were broken through one by one, and what I thought was impossible was done. The facts gave me greater education, and my doubts were dispelled.

From these vivid facts, my conservative thinking was strongly criticized. I also further realized that the reason why my conservative thinking is so deeply rooted is inseparable from my lack of love for learning and my bureaucratic style of work. Because I am busy coping with daily affairs, I have not grasped technical learning and theoretical learning tightly, and I often stop when I encounter difficulties, and I cannot often do more investigation and research work. In the future, I must seriously solve these two problems in order to effectively overcome my conservative thinking that comes from empiricism.

### 经验主义使我产生了严重的保守思想

    经验主义使我产生了严重的保守思想
    石景山发电厂副厂长　王文斌
    推广先进经验的工作，推动了企业中的生产改革，也帮助管理企业的干部进行了思想改造。石景山发电厂学习苏联先进经验燃烧低值煤，就是改造我的保守思想的一个很好的开始。
    我是工人出身，在石景山发电厂工作已经三十一年。解放后，党提拔我做本厂的副厂长。在工作中，我虽然也很努力，一心一意想把工作作好，但是由于考虑问题时常从过去的狭隘的经验出发，因而我的保守思想是相当严重的。党曾不断对我进行教育，但我并没有很好纠正这一缺点。在燃烧低值煤的过程中，这种保守思想更集中地暴露出来了。
    去年十月起，石景山发电厂就曾断断续续地做燃烧低值煤的试验，今年红五月竞赛中正式开始燃烧低值煤。从提出燃烧低值煤这个意见到党的总支委员会做出决定，以至开始燃烧以后的相当时间，我一直是犹疑不决，信心不足，在试验中也没有积极主动地领导这一工作。因为我根据过去的经验，认为这个厂在国民党和日伪统治时代，由于其他原因也曾几次试烧低值煤，结果都失败了。现在又提出要烧低值煤，我首先想到的就是过去失败的教训。担心低值煤灰分太大，含热量很小，燃烧后无法达到定额出力，安全运转也会受到影响，万一造成停电事故时怎么办？我忽视了觉悟了的、特别是“三反”运动以后工人阶级的伟大的创造力量，也没有分析今天的工厂与过去的不同，没有重视苏联的先进经验。自然，在主观上我并不轻视工人的创造，我自己也曾有过不少创造。但是，在考虑问题时，首先想到的是自己的经验，事情能不能办成，常是依靠过去的经验而定。这就影响了我不能锐敏地迅速地接受先进经验。
    另外，老工人们有时也从技术人员那里接受一些零碎片断的理论知识，并把它作为自己的狭隘经验的根据。我自己也是如此。这次，许多技术人员根据他们的计算和估计，也认为低值煤是不能烧的。这些说法更助长了我的保守思想。因此，在讨论燃烧低值煤时，我总以为别人考虑的是“成本”，我考虑的是“安全”，大家各有道理，谁也不能说服谁。加以我过多地考虑困难，不敢大胆地去突破这些困难，因而对烧低值煤的工作更是信心不足。
    在烧低值煤过程中，党曾经通过各种方式对我进行了教育。党对我的缺点是了解得很清楚的。总支委员会的同志们逐步地帮助我认识烧低值煤的重大意义，帮助我分析今天生产的有利的条件，指出我的思想方法的缺点，鼓励我大胆负责有计划地逐步地进行试验。党还运用各种方式帮助我解决推广工作中的各种问题。从这些启发教育中，我的想法逐渐改变，当我懂得了烧低值煤的重大意义后，就不再认为我和大家的争执是你算“成本”我讲“安全”了；同时，我也看到许多同志在提出困难后立刻就想着如何去克服它，而我想的常常不是如何克服困难，只是说不能做，也就是在困难面前退缩。特别是当群众响应了党的号召行动起来以后，问题一个个地解决了，困难一个个地被突破了，我认为不成的都做成了，事实给了我更大的教育，我的疑虑也就打消了。
    从这些生动的事实里，我的保守思想受到了有力的批判。我也进一步认识了我的保守思想所以这样根深蒂固，和我的不爱学习以及工作中的事务主义是分不开的。因为忙于应付日常事务，对技术学习和理论学习都抓得不紧，常常遇到困难就停止下来，也不能经常地多做调查研究工作。今后，必须认真地解决这两个问题，才能有效地克服我的来自经验主义的保守思想。
