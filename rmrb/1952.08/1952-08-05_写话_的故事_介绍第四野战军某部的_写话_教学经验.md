    Editor's note: After the students have achieved the goal of rapid literacy, how to turn the "two abilities" (reading and writing) into "four abilities" (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) is an important issue. The pilot experience of a unit of the Fourth Field Army proves that after students have initially learned to write and take dictation, question-and-answer writing activities become the most effective way to improve students' writing skills and develop the "four abilities." Combined with reading, after only about ten hours of teaching, students who previously couldn't write at all can write fluent short essays of more than 300 words. This article vividly introduces this experience in a story format.

    Searching for Solutions to Difficulties
    Instructor Wang hadn't slept well for the past two or three nights, troubled by a problem. The soldiers had learned about two thousand characters and could speak fluently, so why was writing so difficult for them? They couldn't write a few sentences in two hours, always repeating phrases like "Resist America, Aid Korea," "Strive to Learn Culture," and "I want to study hard."
    He raised this issue during the teaching research group meeting. Comrades believed that this was an inevitable stage in writing practice, and after a month or two, they would naturally write more and better. However, Instructor Wang didn't think so. There were only a few months left for this year's cultural education, and arithmetic would be taught later. If a solid foundation in language wasn't laid now, it would be difficult to complete this year's plan. Besides, the soldiers were usually full of energy, but they would break into a sweat when they wrote. If he couldn't help them solve this difficulty, could he still be considered a good instructor? Finally, the political instructor came up with an idea: "Why don't you talk to a few soldiers first to see exactly where their difficulties in writing lie?"
    During the lunch break, he spoke with Wang Wenxian, a student of average ability.
    "Do you find writing difficult?"
    "Yes, it's terrible. Writing the other day gave me a headache."
    "Why do you always write the same old things like 'Strive to Learn' and 'Resist America, Aid Korea'? Usually, you have so much to say and speak so well!"
    "Instructor Wang, my mind is so confused when I write. I want to write this sentence, and then I want to write that sentence. I can't write two words in this sentence, and I can't remember a few words in that sentence. After thinking about it, I see that class is almost over, so I just pick a few sentences I see every day and write them down."
    "The sentences you're saying right now are quite good. Writing them down would make a pretty good piece of writing. Why don't you write like that?"
    "It would be easier to write those sentences; I only wouldn't know how to write about three words. But that's because you asked me. Usually, you always say to write what you think in your heart, what you say, and what you see with your eyes. You don't know, I think, say, and see so much, where do you want me to start?"
    Instructor Wang spoke with three more people, and their opinions were similar. From this, he realized that if he asked them a question and had them write down their answers, it would be easier for them.
    During the teaching research group meeting that evening, everyone said this was a good idea. The teaching group leader also added a very good suggestion: "The students in your class are still at a very low level. Don't ask questions that are too difficult. It's best to ask questions that everyone can answer. For the first question, just ask them to answer in one or two sentences. You can gradually increase the difficulty later. If you ask questions that are too difficult at the beginning, I'm afraid everyone won't be able to answer. You should first set an example for everyone."

    The First Question-and-Answer Writing Practice
    On the first day of question-and-answer writing practice, Instructor Wang asked the following questions: "What is your name?", "How old are you this year?", "Where are you from?", "Who else is in your family?", "What do they all do?", "What year did you join the army?", "What was life like before you joined the army?", and "What is life like after you joined the army?" After asking the first question, he had everyone write. After a few people finished writing, he asked the second question, and so on, question by question.
    At first, the classroom was quiet, with only the sound of pens scratching on paper. By the third sentence, everyone stopped writing. Some scratched their heads, while others discussed with the people next to them. It turned out that many people didn't know how to write the names of their hometowns and were stumped.
    "Comrades, you can look up the characters you don't know in the character dictionary, ask the people in your group, or ask me."
    "Instructor, how do you write 'Tongliao'?"
    "Instructor, the character 'Shao' in 'Shaoguan' is not in the character dictionary."...
    This one sentence took up a quarter of an hour.
    After class, Instructor Wang looked at everyone's assignments and saw that they had improved a lot compared to last time.
    Wang Wenxian wrote:
    "My name is Wang Wenxian, I am twenty-five years old this year, I am from Chifeng County in Rehe Province, my family has a father (亲), mother (亲), two older brothers, two older sisters-in-law (嫂), and four nephews (侄). My oldest brother works in the district, my father (亲) and second brother farm at home, and my second sister-in-law is the head (任) of the women's association. I joined the army in 1948. Before joining the army, I worked for the big landlord carrying 和 (活), and I also worked as a pig herder (倌). My life (活) was very hard. After joining the army, I fought from Northeast China to Guangdong and received one major merit and two minor merits. Now I am studying culture and military affairs. I think my life (活) is very good. This is all thanks to the Party (党) and Chairman Mao."
    Zhang Dacheng was a comrade who did very well in his studies, but he didn't write very well.
    "Zhang Dacheng: Twenty-four years old, from the Northeast, father, older brother, older sister-in-law, younger brother, and younger sister are all farmers, joined the army in 1949, very bitter, very good."
    Why didn't he write well? It turned out that he was on guard duty the previous class and was late, so he didn't see the instructor's demonstration. "It's all my fault for being careless!" Instructor Wang angrily knocked himself on the head.
    Looking at everyone's assignments: the second, third, and fourth sentences all had an extra "I" character. If this character wasn't causing trouble, everyone could write a relatively fluent short essay. Why did everyone use so many "I" characters? "Wang Youming, Wang Youming, it's all your fault for not using your brain. Why did you put a 'you' character in every question? 'You' are called what, 'you' are how old this year...'" After understanding this, Instructor Wang criticized himself.

    Encountered Difficulties
    The second time, the questions were about their learning situation. At the beginning of the class, Instructor Wang first picked a few assignments from the previous class and read them to everyone.
    "Everyone always says that writing is difficult. You wrote so well this time; it's already a small essay."
    Learning from the previous lesson, Instructor Wang explained the question-and-answer writing method again before posing the questions for everyone to answer. The first question was, "Did you study at home?" The second question was, "Why didn't you study?" (For people who had studied for a few days: "Why was your study time so short?") Everyone wrote very well.
    Then he posed the third question: "Without education, what difficulties do you encounter in your work?" Some students finished quickly. The instructor then posed the fourth question.
    "Instructor, too fast. I haven't finished the previous one yet!" Wang Wenxian was the first to object. "I haven't finished either," "I've only written half"... everyone clamored.
    "Those who haven't finished should continue writing. I'll write the questions on the blackboard. You can look at them later."
    That evening, Instructor Wang raised two issues at the teaching research group meeting:
    "Some people write quickly, and some people write slowly. For example, Zhang Dacheng answered all eight questions, Wang Wenxian only answered four, and Zhu Xiaoxian only answered three. What should we do about this?"
    "My intention was to have everyone write more, but when I asked, 'Why didn't you study at home?' seventeen out of twenty people only wrote one sentence. Wang Wenxian wrote the most, with only two or three sentences: 'Because my family was poor, where would we get the money to study? We couldn't even afford to eat.' How can we get everyone to write more?"
    Regarding the first question, everyone said that fingers are of different lengths, and students' abilities vary, so how can everyone write at the same speed?
    Regarding the second question, Instructor Liu from a higher level introduced his experience:
    "At the beginning, my class didn't write much either, but once I inspired them, they wrote more. For example, if a student writes 'My family was too poor to afford school,' you should ask, 'How poor was your family?', 'How much does it cost to study for a year? How much work does it take away?', 'If you don't have money to study, will people let you?'..." As soon as Instructor Wang heard this, he felt like a door had opened in his mind, illuminating everything.
    The political instructor sat next to him and didn't say a word the whole time. Finally, everyone sought his opinion. He said:
    "I don't have any opinions on the second question. I've been thinking about the first question. Students' abilities vary, but not by that much. Instructor Wang, why don't you talk to the students who write quickly and the students who write slowly?"

    Overcoming Difficulties and Advancing by Leaps and Bounds
    During the lunch diagnosis time, Instructor Wang spoke with Zhang Dacheng and Zhu Xiaoxian. Why did Zhang Dacheng write so quickly? He said:
    "The biggest difficulty for us uneducated people in learning to write is that our hands can't keep up with our minds. Writing is already slow, and if you run into a few characters you don't know how to write, by the time you find the character, the sentence you wanted to write is long gone. When you think of another sentence, it's a different sentence. The character you worked so hard to find can't even be used. So, starting with the third sentence, I used a new trick. I left the characters I didn't know blank and just kept writing. After I finished answering all the questions, I turned to the character dictionary, textbooks, and asked the people in my group and the instructor to fill in the blanks. Instructor Wang, look..."
    Before Zhang Dacheng could finish speaking, Zhu Xiaoxian interrupted: "So that's how it is. What you said is absolutely right. The reason why I write slowly is that I spend all my time thinking about individual characters."
    As Instructor Wang listened, he thought: Although the political instructor has a low level of education, he has been eating revolutionary meals for many years and is truly remarkable.
    That evening, Instructor Wang prepared a lesson plan well, anticipating the problems that students might encounter.
    The next day, at the beginning of the class, Instructor Wang first introduced Zhang Dacheng's and Zhu Xiaoxian's experiences and lessons learned. Everyone said, "So that's the trick!"
    This time they were writing about "Your Home". Instructor Wang first asked, "What was your family's life like before liberation?" He asked everyone to write as much detail as possible. After speaking, he walked around the classroom, looking at what everyone was writing. Zhu Xiaoxian wrote, "Before liberation, my family was very poor," and put down his pen. "How poor was your family?" Instructor Wang asked. He wrote again, "The whole family of five relied on my father to work for others to support us. We couldn't eat enough or wear enough." Instructor Wang asked again, "What were the summers like? What were the winters like? What was it like during the New Year?" "Aren't you telling us to write faster? If I write according to what you're asking, wouldn't it turn into a sob story? Where would it end?" "It doesn't matter. There are only two or three questions today. Write as much as you can."
    There were also others who finished writing and were waiting. Instructor Wang introduced Zhu Xiaoxian's situation to everyone, and those who had finished writing immediately picked up their pens and started writing furiously.
    This class lasted for two full hours. Let's take a look at the first question that Wang Wenxian wrote:
    "Before liberation, my family rented two mu of land from the big landlord Hu Heixin. The grain we harvested was enough to pay the rent but not enough to pay off our debts. We were hungry (饥) year after year. In the year I turned eight, we had a drought (旱) and disaster (灾). We couldn't pay the rent, and my father was arrested (押) and taken to the police station. In the winter, three feet of snow fell, and even the trees froze to death. The three of us brothers were all bare-bottomed (腚) and didn't dare to get off the kang. When the New Year came, the landlord's family cooked dumplings, but our family of five drank a few mouthfuls of thin gruel (粥) and went to bed early, lying on the kang listening to the firecrackers of the landlord's family. ..."

    Cannot be Complacent, Must Improve
    After eight question-and-answer writing practices, students were generally able to write short essays of more than 500 words. It coincided with the regiment's celebration meeting, and Instructor Wang was elected as a youth model by everyone to introduce his experience on stage.
    After talking about his experience, he said the following: "The main reason I have been able to achieve this little success is that the political instructor has led well, and other instructor comrades in the company have also given me a lot of help. The most important thing is that I understand the difficulties of the students at all times and in all places. Once the difficulties are clear, it is easy to find a solution. This is completely what the political instructor taught me.
    "There are still a few problems that have not been resolved in our experience: How to combine question-and-answer writing with lecturing? How to combine question-and-answer writing with reading reference materials? How to transition from question-and-answer writing to general writing? We have already started working on this, but we don't have much experience yet.
    "Question-and-answer writing is a good way to improve writing skills. I hope everyone will adopt it! There are still many immature aspects in our experience, and I hope everyone will revise and supplement them in the course of implementation!"
    The audience erupted in applause like a storm.

    “写话”的故事
    ——介绍第四野战军某部的“写话”教学经验
    郑力
    编者按：在学员们达到速成识字的目的以后，如何使他们将“两会”变成“四会”，是一个重要的问题。第四野战军某部的试点经验证明：在学员初步学会写字、听写以后，问答写话活动就成为提高学员写作能力、发展“四会”的最有效的办法。结合阅读，经过只十小时左右的教学，便能使完全不会作文的学员会写三百字以上的通顺的短文。本文用故事体裁，生动地介绍了这个经验。
    研究难点找办法
    王教员近来两三宵没睡好觉，有一个问题叫他苦恼。战士们学会了两千来字，说起话来也能滔滔不断，为什么写起话来却是这么困难？两个钟头写不出几句话，老是“抗美援朝”、“努力学文化”、“我要好好学习”这一套。
    教学研究组开会的时候，他提出了这个问题。同志们认为这是写话的一个必经阶段，等一两个月，自然会慢慢地写得多、写得好。可是王教员不这么想。今年的文化教育，只剩下几个月的时间了，以后又要教算术，如果现在不给语文打好基础，要完成今年的计划，那是困难的。再说战士们平日都像生龙活虎，可是一写起话来，却别得满头大汗。要是不能帮助他们解决这个困难，还能算一个好教员吗？最后还是指导员给出了个主意：“你先找几个战士聊聊，看他们写话的困难究竟在哪里？”
    午间休息的时候，他找了一个中等程度的学员王文先谈话。
    “你看写话难不难？”
    “可不是，前天写话把我的脑袋都弄痛了。”
    “为啥你们一写就是‘努力学习’、‘抗美援朝’这老一套呢？平常你们的话不是挺多、说得也挺好吗？”
    “王教员，写话时脑子乱极了，又想写这句，又想写那句；这句话当中有两个字不会写，那句话当中也有几个字记不住。想来想去，眼看快下课了，只好拣天天见面的几句话写上去。”
    “你说的这几句话就挺好，写下来就是一篇挺好的写话，干吗你不这样写呢？”
    “这几句话要写倒差不多，只有三个字不会写。不过这是你问到我了，平常你总说写你心里想的、口里说的、眼睛里看到的，你不知道我想的、说的看到的可真太多了，叫我从哪里下手呢？”
    王教员又找三个人谈了话，他们的意见都差不多。从这儿他悟出个道理——要是我问他们一句话，让他们把答话写出来，一定比较容易。
    晚上教学研究组开会，大家都说这是个好主意。教员组长还提了个很好的补充意见：“你们这一班学员程度还很低，出问题不要太难，最好出一些大家都能答得上的问题；第一次的问题，只要用一两句话就能答完，以后可以逐步加深。如果一开始问题出得太难，恐怕大家不会答。你先作个样子给大家看。”
    第一次问答写话
    问答写话的第一天，王教员出了这样几个问题：“你叫什么名字？”、“你今年多少岁？”、“你是什么地方人？”、“你家里还有些什么人？”、“他们都是干什么的？”、“你是那一年参军的？”、“参军以前生活怎样？”、“参军以后生活又怎样？”问了第一句，就让大家写；有几个人写完了，再问第二句；这样一句、一句往下问。
    开始教室里静悄悄的，只听见笔在纸上刷刷地响。写到第三句话的时候，大家都停下笔来，有的搔脑袋，有的跟旁边的人商量。原来很多人不会写自己家乡的地名，被难住了。
    “同志们，不会写的字可以查单字本，可以问同组的人，也可以问我。”
    “教员，通辽两个字怎样写？”
    “教员，韶关的‘韶’字单字本上没有。”………
    为这句话就耽误了一刻钟。
    下课以后，王教员看大家的作业本，比上一次进步多了。
    王文先是这样写的：
    “我叫王文先，我今年二十五岁，我是热河省赤峰县人，我家里有父親（亲）母親（亲），两个哥哥，两个少（嫂）少，四个至（侄）儿，大哥在区下工作，父親（亲）跟二哥在家种地，二少（嫂）是父（妇）女会主人（任）。我是一九四八年参的军，参军以前给大地主扛和（活），还当过猪官（倌），生和（活）很苦。参军以后，从东北打到广东，立了一大功两小功，现在学文化学军事，我感想生和（活）很好。这都是?（党）和毛主席给我们的。”
    张大成是功课很好的一个同志，他却写得不很好。
    “张大成：二十四岁，东北人，父亲、哥哥、嫂嫂、弟弟妹妹，都是种地的，四九年参军，很苦，很好。”
    他为什么写不好呢？原来上一课轮到他站岗，迟到了，没有看到教员的示范。“都怪我粗心！”王教员生气地敲了一下自己的脑袋。
    再看每个人的作业：第二句、第三句、第四句都多了一个“我”字，如果没有这个字捣蛋，每个人都可写出一篇比较通顺的短文。为什么大家用这么多“我”字呢？“王友明啦王友明，这都怪你自己不用脑子，为什么你在每一句问话里都安上一个‘你’字呢？又是‘你’叫什么，又是‘你’今年多少岁，……”想通了这个道理，王教员把自己批评了一顿。
    碰到了困难
    第二次问的是学习情况。一上课，王教员先把上一课的作业挑几篇给大家念了一遍。
    “大家总说写话困难，这一次你们写得多好，已经是一篇小文章了。”
    接受上次的教训，王教员又把问答写话的方法再讲了一遍，然后才提出问题让大家回答。第一个问题是“你在家念没念过书？”第二个问题是“为什么你不念书呢？”（对于念过几天书的人问：“为什么你念书的时间这样短？”）大家都写得很好。
    接着提第三个问题：“没有文化，工作上有些什么困难？”有的学员很快就写完了。教员便提出了第四个问题。
    “教员，太快了，前面的我还没写完哩！”王文先第一个提意见。“我也没写完”，“我才写了一半”……，大家都嚷开了。
    “没写完的还是写你的，问题我写在黑板上，待会儿你们再看好了。”
    晚上王教员在教学研究组的会上提出了两个问题：
    “有人写的快，有人写的慢，像张大成把八个问题都答了，王文先只答了四个，朱小贤只答了三个，这怎么办？”
    “我本意让大家多写点，可是问‘为什么你在家不念书呢？’二十个人当中，十七个人都只写了一句。像王文先算是写得最多的，也只有两三句话：‘因为我家里穷，那有钱念书呢，连吃饭都顾不上。’怎样才能使大家写得多呢？”
    对于第一个问题，大家都说，十个指头有长短，学员程度有高有低，哪能都写得一般快呢！
    对第二个问题，高一级的刘教员介绍了自己的经验：
    “我那一班开头大家也写不多，可是一经启发，他们就写多了。比如说学员写‘家里穷念不起书’，你就该问‘家里怎么穷法？’、‘念一年书要花多少钱？耽误多少工夫？’、‘没有钱去念书，人家让不让？……’”王教员一听，心里就像开了一扇门，豁亮了。
    指导员坐在旁边一直没吱声，最后大家征求他的意见。他说：
    “第二个问题我没啥意见，我一直在考虑第一个问题。学员程度有高低，但总差不了那么远。王教员，你还是找写得快的跟写得慢的学员了解一下吧！”
    克服了困难，大步前进
    中午诊断时间，王教员找张大成跟朱小贤谈话。张大成为什么写得快呢？他说：
    “我们大老粗学写话，最大的困难是手不应心。本来写字就慢，要是再碰上几个不会写的字，等你把字找出来，想写的那句话早忘的没影啦。回头再想出来的又是另外一句话，费了劲找出来的那个字还用不上。所以我从第三句话起就用了个新道道，不会写的字空下，只管往前写。赶到把问题都答完了，再翻单字本、找课本、问同组的人、问教员，把空着的字补进去。王教员，你看……”
    朱小贤不等张大成说完就插进去了：“原来是这么会事，你说的一点儿也不差，我为啥写的慢，时间都花在想单字上了。”
    王教员一面听一面想：指导员虽说文化程度低，但多吃几年革命饭，可真不简单。
    晚上，王教员好好地准备了一个教案，把学员可能发生的问题都作了准备。
    第二天一上课，王教员先介绍了张大成跟朱小贤的经验教训，大伙儿都说：“原来窍门在这儿！”
    这一次写的是“你的家”。王教员先问：“解放以前你家里的生活怎样？”让大家写得越详细越好。说完了就在教室里四处走，看大家写了些什么。朱小贤写了一句“解放前我家里很穷”，就把笔放下了。“你家里怎么穷法呢？”王教员问了一句。他又写了“全家五口人，指着父亲给人扛活来养活，吃不上，穿不上。”王教员又问：“吃不上穿不上，夏天的光景怎样？冬天的光景又是怎样？过年的时候又是个啥光景？”“你不是叫我们写快些吗？照你问的写起来不变成诉苦了吗？哪还有个完。”“没关系，今天只有两三个问题，你写得越多越好。”
    别的人也有写完了等着的，王教员把朱小贤的情形跟大家一介绍，写完了的人也马上拿起笔，刷刷地写开了。
    这一堂足足写了两个钟头，咱们看看王文先写的第一个问题吧：
    “解放以前，我家租种大地主胡黑心两垧地，打的粮食够了交租不够还债，一年年拉几（饥）荒。我八岁那一年，赶上闹汗（旱）栽（灾），交不上租子，父亲压（押）进了派出所。冬天下三尺深的雪，连树都冻死了，我们弟兄三个都光着定（腚），不敢下炕。到了年下，地主家煮饺子，咱家老小五口喝了几口稀竹（粥）早早就睡了，躺在炕上听地主家的炮仗响。……”
    不能自满，还要提高
    搞了八次问答写话，学员们普遍能写五百字以上的短文了。刚好赶上了团里的庆功大会，王教员被大家选成青年模范，上台去介绍经验。
    他谈完了经验，最后说了这么几句：“我能够取得这么一点成绩，主要是指导员领导得好，连里其他的教员同志也给了我许多帮助。顶重要的是我随时随地了解学员的困难，把困难搞清楚了，想办法也就容易了。这一点完全是指导员教给我的。
    “在我们的经验里还有几个问题没有解决：问答写话怎样跟讲课结合？怎样跟阅读参考读物结合？问答写话怎样过渡到一般的写作上去，我们已经开始搞了，还没有啥经验。
    “问答写话是提高写作能力的一个好办法，我希望大家都来采用！我们的经验里还有许多不成熟的地方，希望大家在执行当中修正，补充！”
    台下发出了像暴风雨一样的掌声。
