    Taiyuan Construction Engineering Company Neglects Safety Work
    To the Editor: The leading cadres of the Taiyuan Construction Engineering Company are solely pursuing production tasks and neglecting safety work, resulting in five consecutive accidents involving injuries and deaths in the nine days from July 25th to August 2nd. The most serious of these was the collapse of the dormitory of Engineering Team 6 at the Dayingpan construction site on August 2nd, which resulted in eight workers being seriously injured and four slightly injured. This is because the leading cadres of this company, in order to save money and rush to complete the task, built a simple dormitory capable of accommodating more than 500 people in less than ten days. According to the original plan, this house was to be more than five meters wide and twenty meters long. Later, the company's leadership, in order to save materials, changed it to eleven meters wide and twenty meters long, and used two- or three-inch thick rafters as pillars. The supporting force of the pillars was small, and they were buried shallowly in the ground; the walls were made of tied reed stalks, with a layer of mud smeared on top; and a thick layer of mud was applied to the roof for rain protection. This made the house heavy at the top and light at the bottom, making it very unstable. The project was not yet completed, and it had not been inspected, but the leading cadres ordered more than eighty workers to move in, resulting in the accident.
    I believe that the occurrence of the above problems is intolerable. The leading cadres of the Taiyuan Construction Engineering Company should make a deep self-criticism and take effective measures to deal with these problems. Mu Jiang

    太原建筑工程公司忽视安全工作
    编辑同志：太原建筑工程公司领导干部单纯追求生产任务，忽视安全工作，致在七月二十五日到八月二日的九天中，连续发生五次伤亡事故。其中最严重的一次是八月二日大营盘工地工程六队宿舍倒塌，工人重伤八名，轻伤四名。这是因为这个公司的领导干部为了省钱和赶任务，不到十天就盖起容纳五百多人的简陋宿舍。这房子按原来规定是五公尺多宽，二十公尺长。后来，公司的领导方面，为了节省材料，把它改为宽十一公尺、长二十公尺，并且用二、三寸粗的椽子做柱子。支柱的力量小，往地下埋的又浅；墙壁是用扎的苇秆做的，上面抹了一层泥；在屋顶抹了很厚的泥以便防雨。这就造成房子的上重下轻，很不稳固。工程还没完毕，也没有经过检验，领导干部就叫八十多个工人搬进去住，因而造成了事故。
    我认为上述问题的发生是不能令人容忍的。太原建筑工程公司领导干部应作深刻检讨，并应采取有效措施处理这些问题。牟江
