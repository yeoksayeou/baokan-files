Xinhua News Agency, 9th August: TASS, New York, 8th August: The "American Peace Crusade" organization has written to the three US presidential candidates—Democrat Stevenson, Republican Eisenhower, and Progressive Hallinan—denouncing the US Air Force Department's plan to indiscriminately bomb seventy-eight North Korean cities.

The letter said: "Parents who have lost their sons and peace-loving people all over the world are expecting you, as candidates for the highest leadership of this country, to protest this plan and to strive for an immediate end to the Korean War and to resolve all unresolved issues at the peace conference table." The letter also said: "We can only unite with the people of the world to question: Does the United States really need peace?" The letter was signed by Richardson and Uphouse, the two chairmen of the "American Peace Crusade."

The "American Peace Crusade" organization also sent the same letter to Truman, requesting him to order General Clark to issue an order to immediately implement a ceasefire and hold a peace conference to resolve all outstanding issues.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th August: TASS, New York, 7th August: A delegation representing the American Women for Peace Committee and several other progressive women's groups visited the United Nations headquarters on the 6th, demanding that the United Nations Secretary-General rescind the cruel order of Backus, commander of the US Fifth Air Force, to destroy seventy-eight cities in Korea.

The delegation's statement said: The United Nations was established to ensure peace. "It is certainly not the UN’s function to cause millions of men, women and children to lose their families, drive them into the fields and highways, displace them, and starve them to the point of near death."

The statement said: In Korea, "a ceasefire can and must be declared immediately. Bombing seventy-eight cities cannot bring peace."

The American women representatives denounced General Backus's barbaric order as an act of provocation. They said: "We look to you with excitement and extreme sadness, and deeply regard this action as shameful."

The statement insisted that the Korean War must be stopped and the threat of a new world war eliminated. The statement was signed by Dr. Baorong, Chairman of the American Women for Peace Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th August: TASS, Oslo, 7th August: "Freedom Daily" published interviews with several prominent Norwegians, protesting the crimes of the American interventionist army's intention to bomb seventy-eight cities in North Korea.

Member of Parliament Follis said: "I have no other name for this matter than barbarism."

Nilsson, director of the Oslo People's Theatre, said: "These are the same methods used by Hitler. I hope the Norwegian government will protest."

Artist Reda Ole said: "Anyone with a kind heart who does not feel numb, regardless of his political views, cannot but protest the crime of mass destruction of Korean cities. It is a disgrace to us to do this in the name of the United Nations."

Xinhua News Agency, 9th August: TASS, London, 8th August: According to news published in newspapers in Canberra, Labor Senator Morrow asked the Australian Senate to protest the bombing of North Korean cities. Morrow mentioned the news published in the newspapers that the US military command had specified the bombing of seventy-eight cities; he said that if this were done, "the result must be the wanton destruction of many civilian men and women, children and their homes." The leader of the government faction in the Senate rejected Morrow's proposal that the Australian Senate protest to the United Nations against the barbaric bombing of North Korean cities by the US Air Force.

    美国和平十字军及美国妇女代表
    斥美军滥炸朝鲜北部计划并要求立即停火
    挪威著名人士和澳工党参议员亦谴责美军罪恶计划
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社纽约八日讯：“美国和平十字军”组织顷致函三位美国总统候选人——民主党的史蒂文森、共和党的艾森豪威尔和进步党的哈利南——斥责美国空军部将滥炸七十八个北朝鲜城市的计划。
    这封信说：“失掉儿子的父母们和全世界各国爱好和平的人民都在期望着作为本国最高领袖候选人的你们抗议这个计划，并且为立即停止朝鲜战争和在和平会议桌上来解决一切未解决的问题而努力。”这封信又说：“我们只有和全世界人民联合在一起来质问：美国是否真正需要和平。”在这封信上签名的有“美国和平十字军”的两位主席李查逊和厄普豪斯。
    “美国和平十字军”组织并以同样的信寄给杜鲁门，要求他命令克拉克将军发布命令，立即实行停火，举行和平会议来解决一切悬而未决的问题。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社纽约七日讯：代表美国妇女和平委员会和其他几个进步妇女团体的一个代表团，于六日访问联合国总部，要求联合国秘书长撤销美国第五航空队司令巴喀斯的炸毁朝鲜七十八个城市的残忍的命令。
    代表团的声明说：联合国的建立是为了保障和平。“联合国的职掌决不是使千万男女妇孺丧失他们的家庭，把他们赶到田野和公路上去，流离失所，饥饿到奄奄一息的地步。”
    声明说：在朝鲜，“是能够而且必须立刻宣布停火的。轰炸七十八个城市决不能带来和平”。
    美国妇女代表们斥责巴喀斯将军的野蛮命令为一种挑衅的行为。她们说：“我们怀着激动和极端悲痛的心情来看你，并且深以这种行动为可耻。”
    声明中坚持必须停止朝鲜战争和消除新的世界战争的威胁。声明由美国妇女和平委员会主席巴奥朗博士签名。
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社奥斯陆七日讯：“自由报”发表了挪威若干著名人士的谈话，抗议美国干涉军打算轰炸朝鲜北部七十八个城市的罪行。
    国会议员佛里斯说：“我对这件事情除了称为野蛮以外没有其他的称呼。”
    奥斯陆人民剧院导演尼尔森说：“这些都是和希特勒使用过的相同的方法。我希望挪威政府提出抗议。”
    艺术家雷达·奥里说：“凡是感觉没有麻木的一个心地仁慈的人，不管他的政治见解如何，都不能不抗议大规模毁灭朝鲜城市的罪行。用联合国的名义做这件事情是我们的一个耻辱。”
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社伦敦八日电：据报纸刊载的堪培拉消息说，工党参议员毛罗要求澳大利亚参议院抗议轰炸北朝鲜城市的举动。毛罗提到报纸所载美军司令部指明要轰炸七十八个城市的消息；他说，如果这样干，“其结果一定是许多男女平民、儿童和他们的家园遭到恣意的摧毁”。参议院中政府派的领袖拒绝了毛罗提出的澳大利亚参议院向联合国抗议美国空军野蛮轰炸北朝鲜城市的建议。
