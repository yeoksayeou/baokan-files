The long-term aggression of imperialism and the long-term reactionary rule of the Kuomintang created a serious unemployment phenomenon in Chinese society and left a large number of unemployed people to the new People's Republic of China. In the past three years, the People's Government has done a lot of work in solving labor employment problems and in providing relief to unemployed people who are temporarily unable to find employment and have financial difficulties, and has achieved remarkable results. First of all, the People's Government adopted a policy of taking over all former public employees when taking over the collapsed reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. A large number of unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals left over from the reactionary rule have been re-employed due to the economic recovery and development and the expansion of various construction works in the past three years. As of December 1951, more than 1.2 million unemployed workers had been re-employed, of which approximately 600,000 were newly hired by state-owned industrial and mining enterprises. Since liberation, approximately one million unemployed intellectuals have participated in various jobs through various training programs, recruitment, and individual placements. In rural areas, land reform has been completed in areas with more than 400 million agricultural people. The unemployed vagrants, former military officers returning to their hometowns for production, and landlords who never engaged in production were allocated land and engaged in labor production just like the peasants. Now, whether in urban or rural areas, the number of employed people is much higher than at any time in history, and the number of people with labor but not working and the number of people without employment opportunities have been greatly reduced compared to any time in history.

However, there are still some unemployed intellectuals, former military officers, and former officials left over from the old society who have not been completely reformed or lack specialized knowledge and skills. Their employment problems cannot be completely solved until the country's construction and various aspects of work have not been developed on a large scale. At the same time, due to the continuous reorganization of the social economy in the past three years and its progress on the path of new democracy, many non-productive industries that are not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood and industries that rely solely on shoddy workmanship and speculation to make money have gradually been eliminated. The industries that once provided corrupt, extravagant consumption for landlords, bureaucrats, and compradores are declining, which inevitably leads to new unemployment and underemployment. After production reform and the improvement of labor organization and the promotion of advanced production methods in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises, labor efficiency has been reasonably improved, and the original employees in the enterprises have surpluses. In addition, many urban housewives (many of whom are educated women) were discriminated against in the old society and could not find jobs, but now they are demanding employment. Some of them used to rely on their husbands for a living and did not want to find jobs, but their thinking has changed in the past three years since liberation, and they are also demanding employment. They are a considerable number of surplus laborers in the cities. In rural areas, there was a surplus of rural labor in the past due to insufficient cultivated land. After the land reform, everyone had land to cultivate and food to eat, but the situation of insufficient cultivated land was basically unchanged, and there was still a large surplus of labor. With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the possible improvement of agricultural tools under the current conditions, such as not actively seeking ways in agriculture, sideline occupations, forestry, animal husbandry, and handicrafts, the surplus of rural labor will be even greater. The surplus rural labor is currently flowing blindly to the cities in an unorganized and unplanned manner, which has also increased the unemployment and underemployment phenomenon in the cities. However, we must recognize that the new unemployment and underemployment problems in cities that accompany economic restructuring and the surplus of urban and rural labor that is revealed due to production reform, social reform, land reform, and organization are inevitable temporary difficulties in the course of advancement, which are fundamentally different from the unemployment problems under reactionary rule.

The employment problem of various unemployed people in cities and the full application of the large amount of surplus labor in urban and rural areas are problems that must be solved in large-scale national construction, and they can be gradually solved under the premise of forward development in production. In order to greet the large-scale national construction that is about to begin, comprehensively solve the employment problems of various unemployed people, gradually eliminate unemployment and underemployment, and plan to fully apply the large amount of surplus labor in urban and rural areas to production and other social undertakings, and further gradually achieve unified allocation of labor, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government convened a special meeting on labor employment issues in July. The results of the meeting's discussions and research are summarized as follows:

(1) All public and private enterprises should abide by the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government and actively develop production and business. In the large-scale economic construction that the country is about to begin, all public and private enterprises that meet the needs of the country and the people have a future. Even if some enterprises encounter temporary difficulties, they should overcome their own difficulties by actively developing production and business, and should not try to solve the problem by dismissing employees, in order to protect the interests of employees and avoid increasing unemployment. The dismissal of employees must be handled in accordance with the Trade Union Law and other relevant laws.

All public and private enterprises should adopt a policy of taking over all surplus employees resulting from the implementation of production reform and the reasonable improvement of labor efficiency. The original enterprise unit should continue to pay the original wages (included in the enterprise cost) and must not dismiss them. And this condition should be used to conduct training in batches to improve their business skills and political and cultural level, in preparation for the expansion of the enterprise or to be assigned by the state. This is also beneficial to encouraging employees to create inventions and put forward rationalization proposals. If some private enterprises must change their business due to economic restructuring and the industry has no future, in principle, labor should change its business at the same time as capital. If the application for business conversion and the plan to open a new business have been approved by the industrial and commercial administration department, and after consultation between labor and capital, a plan for the transfer of employees with capital is formulated based on the plan of the new business and the conditions of the existing employees, and there are still some employees who cannot be placed in the new business, the capital side may apply to the labor department for dismissal in accordance with the Trade Union Law and other relevant laws, and may dismiss them according to law after approval by the labor department. If some private enterprises are indeed losing too much money and are unable to continue operating, and after consultation between labor and capital, they are still unable to develop their business and must shrink or close their business, the closure of the business should be approved by the industrial and commercial administration department, and the dismissal of some or all employees should also be approved by the labor department. If they expand their business or resume operations in the future, they should give priority to the reinstatement of the original employees.

The labor department should carefully handle the dismissal issue based on the current situation and taking into account the interests of both labor and capital. Reasonable dismissal applications should be approved. Any attempt to dismiss employees under false pretenses, or to close down without approval, or to stop work, stop paying wages, or stop providing meals without authorization should be resolutely stopped.

In order to stabilize the economic situation and reduce unemployment, the industrial and commercial administration departments should handle applications for closure and business conversion carefully, and should also pay attention to controlling applications for opening a business, and should thoroughly understand the applicant's financial situation, reasons for opening a business, and business plan, in order to avoid blindly opening a business and blindly closing a business, resulting in unemployment. In order to correctly handle these issues, the industrial and commercial administration departments in large and medium-sized cities may set up an advisory committee to invite the labor department, trade unions, industrial and commercial federations, and other relevant agencies and organizations to participate.

In order to protect the health of employees, improve labor productivity, and expand employment, the eight- to ten-hour work system should be resolutely implemented in a planned and step-by-step manner. All larger public and private industrial, mining, transportation, and transportation enterprises should implement the eight-hour work system as much as possible. Those with raw materials, sales channels, and technical conditions may change the current one-shift or two-shift system per day to two-shift or three-shift system per day. State-owned stores and cooperatives in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas should also implement the eight-hour work system as much as possible. The daily working hours for jobs that are harmful to health should be less than eight hours. All overtime work in public and private enterprises should be strictly restricted.

Unemployed workers should be universally registered and introduced to employment or given retraining. For unemployed workers who cannot be employed or participate in retraining immediately, those who are truly in financial difficulties should be resettled by adopting methods such as "work-for-relief," "immigrant reclamation," and "production for self-rescue," or given temporary relief or long-term relief.

For the laboring women and other housewives among the unemployed and employed employees, they should be organized to process for factories or engage in other handicraft production as much as possible according to the conditions of raw materials and sales channels, and they should be absorbed into other jobs according to needs and possibilities.

(2) On the issue of intellectuals, the basic situation is that there are too few intellectuals and they cannot meet the needs of large-scale national construction. However, there is currently a group of unemployed intellectuals in society, most of whom do not have specialized knowledge and skills, which is exactly what the colonial economy and the old education system of old China have created. Their thinking is slower to progress, some people are beginning to be somewhat aware, some are still relatively backward, and some people's political and historical situation is indeed more complicated. Most of them are middle-aged, have more family burdens, generally do not want to go to the countryside, let alone work in remote areas, and some people do have difficulties if they go to work in other places. All of these are the reasons why they have not been able to obtain employment opportunities earlier. Among them, there are also some people who have never participated in any occupation for various reasons in the past, and housewives from intellectual families account for a large proportion of them. On the other hand, some enterprises and institutions in the past were only willing to accept young student cadres, and they also had concerns about absorbing these unemployed intellectuals to participate in work. Now we must break this concern, proceed from reality, proceed from the overall situation, and adopt the policy of widely absorbing, educating, reforming, and using the existing unemployed intellectuals; otherwise, we cannot meet the urgent needs of the large-scale national construction that is about to begin. In particular, departments such as education, health, trade, and cooperation must pay attention to absorbing these unemployed intellectuals, training and reforming them, using them, and continuing to reform them in their work; at the same time, the unemployed intellectuals themselves should also recognize their ideological shortcomings and strive to reform themselves. For people who have had some problems in the past, as long as they honestly explain the situation clearly, we should still adopt the policy of educating, reforming, and using them. For the few unemployed intellectuals who can apply for universities or secondary vocational schools, we can help them apply for further study to meet the needs of the further development of national construction.

Among the unemployed intellectuals, there are also some people who have considerable knowledge and have a considerable reputation in the local area, but they are old and weak and cannot undertake hard work. Appropriate measures should be taken to absorb them to participate in appropriate work and take care of them. Appropriate relief should also be given to unemployed intellectuals who are generally old and weak, completely unable to work, and truly in financial difficulties.

For housewives from intellectual families who are now demanding to come out to work, special consideration should also be given to the fact that most of them have the burden of family affairs. Appropriate measures should be gradually taken in an organized and planned manner to absorb them to participate in work, such as asking them to work half a day or a few hours a day, and giving them a certain amount of living allowance. This is also a win-win situation.

(3) A large number of former military officers and former officials left over from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang were generally supporters of the reactionary rule. Although some of them still have antagonistic sentiments towards the People's Government, most of them have expressed their willingness to stand with the people and make meritorious service to atone for their sins under the influence of the great victory of the people in the past three years.

Most of the former military officers and former officials have returned to their hometowns for production and have been allocated land in the land reform to engage in agricultural labor. After they returned to their hometowns, some of them were dissatisfied with the local masses, and the peasant masses supervised them, which is very natural and necessary. However, as long as they do work hard in production or engage in other legitimate occupations, abide by government laws, and have no reactionary behavior, and have been in the local area since the day of liberation for three years, they should change their status as former military officers and former officials with the approval of the township people's congress and the county people's government, and re-establish their new status according to the nature of their labor or occupation (those who also have the status of landlord should be dealt with according to the regulations on changing the status of landlords). Former military officers and former officials scattered in the cities, some of whom have ways to make a living, some of whom have found jobs, but some of them are engaged in improper business, and some people are indeed in financial difficulties. These two types of people should be registered, and the policy of education, reform, and use should be adopted. They should be trained, reformed, and helped to change careers in a planned and phased manner, so that they can continue to reform in labor and work. Similarly, former military officers and former officials should also strive to reform themselves and explain their history clearly. Those who have no major political or historical problems and have sincerely confessed should still adopt the policy of education, reform, and use. A small number of senior former military officers and former officials who are unable to participate in training and change careers and are truly in financial difficulties should also be given appropriate consideration in handling them if they have no significant bad deeds in the past and are not unpopular with the people.

In addition, there are some people among the former military officers and former officials who participated in the Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition, the Anti-Japanese War, and those who were demobilized and returned to their hometowns after the uprising. If they have no significant bad deeds in history, they should be given preferential consideration in handling them.

(4) The large amount of surplus labor in rural areas is different from the unemployed and underemployed in cities. They have food to eat and land to cultivate. However, they have a large amount of potential labor that has not been brought into play, and we should actively find ways to bring it into production. At the same time, the cultivated land is insufficient, and it is not enough to cultivate under the current technical conditions. Further development will definitely produce more surplus labor. This is the most fundamental issue. Therefore, from a fundamental perspective, we must plan and step-by-step immigrate to the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest regions, and carry out reclamation to expand the cultivated area without destroying soil and water conservation and without hindering the development of animal husbandry. Develop small-scale water conservancy on a large scale, turn dry land into watery land, improve seeds, improve farming techniques, promote intensive farming, and increase the yield per unit area. In densely populated areas, there is also a large amount of abandoned land, such as sandy land, alkaline land, and red land, which experience has proven can be utilized. Rural surplus labor should be organized to cultivate these abandoned land. Land improvement, soil improvement, flood storage cultivation of lakes, and soil and water conservation work in mountainous areas should also be carried out in a planned manner.

In addition, planned development of marketable sideline occupations, handicrafts, and preliminary processing of agricultural and sideline products, afforestation, fish farming and fishing, dredging rivers, building roads, and constructing large-scale water conservancy projects can all accommodate a large number of surplus labor. The relevant departments should formulate plans and implement them step by step in accordance with local conditions. In particular, the General Cooperative should promote handicrafts production cooperatives as much as possible for handicraft products that are conducive to both domestic sales and exports.

It is necessary to actively carry out organization and carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement. On the basis of organization, it will be easier to promote immigration and reclamation, land improvement, and small-scale water conservancy projects.

The development of cities and industries and the development of various aspects of national construction will absorb entire batches of labor from rural areas, but this work must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and it is impossible to absorb a large number of people in the short term. Therefore, we must vigorously persuade the peasants to overcome the peasants' blindly flowing to the cities.

(5) For the unemployment problem of minority ethnic residents scattered in cities, the current focus is on the unemployment of the Hui people. We must pay close attention to helping solve it. Because their customs are different from the Han people, and the scope of employment is narrow, we must find ways to give them broad opportunities for employment and career change. In addition to helping them find employment sporadically, it is best to absorb them into industrial and mining enterprises in batches in a planned manner, and their customs should be respected as much as possible.

(6) Proper arrangements must be made for returned refugees and poor overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese affairs agencies and local civil affairs agencies should pay close attention to this. We must make full use of all opportunities to help them find jobs or arrange for production, and we must not allow them to become unemployed, out of school, or displaced. A portion of those who have no labor, are poor and have no support, and are in financial difficulties must be given relief.

(7) A group of old, weak, disabled, and homeless children in society who have lost their labor force and are poor and have no support should be taken in, educated, or given relief separately in a planned manner. Some of them who can still engage in light labor can also be organized to produce and subsidize their lives. As for vagrants and beggars who have labor, they should be forced to work. If conditions permit, it is best to centrally take them in and reform them through labor. (8) All unemployed people in cities should be registered uniformly. All workers and staff who were originally engaged in physical or mental labor in public and private industrial and commercial enterprises, transportation, transportation undertakings, handicraft workshops, and institutions, organizations, and schools, as well as construction workers and porters without fixed employers who have no fixed jobs after unemployment, seasonal workers whose industries have declined and cannot find jobs, intellectuals with a junior high school education or above who are unemployed, independent producers, merchants, vendors, capitalist agents, and small industrialists and businessmen who have stopped working and closed their businesses, who have no other income, are in financial difficulties, and require employment to engage in wage labor, as well as former military officers and former officials who have no jobs, are in financial difficulties, and require employment should be registered uniformly. After registration, they will be handled separately according to different situations. Generally, they should be trained in batches and phases in a planned manner, and then their job problems should be gradually solved according to the needs of national construction and development and their own conditions. In order to meet the needs of the work, political training, employment training, and career change training should generally be handled by the employing departments. Unemployed people who are registered and are truly in financial difficulties should be given appropriate relief.

In order to solve the labor employment problem uniformly and gradually achieve unified allocation of labor, labor employment committees should be established in the central government, large administrative regions, provinces, and large cities, and working bodies with full-time personnel in charge must be established to guide the labor departments and other relevant departments in handling the registration and handling of all unemployed people. Cities under the jurisdiction of provinces may also establish labor employment committees with the approval of the provincial people's government if necessary.

In short, to deal with the employment problem of the unemployed and underemployed in cities, and to deal with the problem of the huge amount of surplus labor in urban and rural areas, we must consider the needs of national construction, consider the overall situation, proceed from reality, aim at long-term goals, and start with what we can and should do now, in order to gradually eliminate unemployment and enable the surplus labor in urban and rural areas to fully exert its potential labor capacity in a planned manner, create more wealth for the country and society, and promote the country's economic construction and other constructions to develop even further.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于劳动就业问题的决定
    帝国主义长期的侵略与国民党长期的反动统治，在中国社会上造成了严重的失业现象，并且把大量的失业人员遗留给人民的新中国。三年以来，人民政府在解决劳动就业问题上，在救济一时难以就业而又生活困难的失业人员上，做了不少工作，也有了显著成绩。首先，对国民党反动统治崩溃时所有旧公教人员，人民政府在接管时采取了全部包下来的政策。反动统治遗留下来的大批失业工人和失业知识分子，由于三年来经济的恢复和发展与各项建设工作的展开，绝大部分业已重新就业。截至一九五一年十二月为止，失业工人重新就业者已达一百二十余万人，其中国营工矿企业新吸收的职工约六十万人。失业知识分子，解放以来，经过各种训练招聘以及个别安置而参加各种工作者，约有一百万人。在农村中，由于已有四万万以上农业人口的地区完成了土地改革，农村中的无业游民、还乡生产的旧军官以及从来不事生产的地主也和农民一样分得一份土地，从事劳动生产。现在无论在城市或在农村，劳动就业的人数较之历史上的任何时期都多得多，有劳动力而不劳动的人和没有就业机会的人较之历史上的任何时期都大大减少了。
    但是，还有一部分旧社会遗留下来的失业知识分子和旧军官、旧官吏，由于自身未经改造，或者缺乏专门的知识和技能，在国家各项建设和各方面工作还未大量发展起来以前，就业问题尚不能完全解决。同时，由于社会经济三年来不断地进行改组，在新民主主义道路上向前迈进，许多非生产的不利于国计民生的行业和专靠偷工减料、投机捣把来发财的行业逐渐被淘汰，过去专供地主官僚买办腐化享乐奢侈消费的行业日趋没落，这就必然发生新的失业半失业的现象。工矿交通企业经过生产改革与劳动组织的改进、先进生产方法的推广等，劳动效率合理地提高了，企业中原有的职工就有了剩余。此外，城市中广大的家庭妇女（其中有许多是具有相当文化程度的知识妇女），有的过去在旧社会受到歧视而找不到职业，现在要求就业；有的过去是靠丈夫生活而不想找职业，解放三年来思想起了变化，也要求就业。她们是城市里相当大的一批剩余劳动力。在农村中因已耕的土地不足，农村劳动力过去就有剩余。土地改革后，人人有地种、有饭吃了，但已耕土地不足的情况基本并未改变，劳动力仍有大量剩余，加以互助合作运动的开展与目前条件下可能的农具改良，如不在农业、副业、林业、畜牧业、手工业等方面积极设法，农村劳动力的剩余将更加多，农村中的剩余劳动力目前是在无组织无计划地盲目地向城市流动着，这也增加了城市中的失业半失业现象。但我们必须认清城市中伴随着经济改组而来的新的失业半失业问题及因生产改革、社会改革、土地改革、组织起来而显现出来的城乡剩余劳动力，是前进中不可避免的一时的困难，这与反动统治下的失业问题本质上是完全不同的。
    城市各种失业人员的就业问题和城乡大量剩余劳动力之充分应用的问题，是在大规模的国家建设中必须解决的问题，在生产向前发展的前提下也是完全可以逐步得到解决的。中央人民政府政务院为了迎接即将开始的大规模的国家建设，全面解决各种失业人员的就业问题，逐步消灭失业半失业现象，有计划地把城乡大量的剩余劳动力充分应用到生产事业及其他社会事业中来，并进而逐步做到统一调配劳动力，特于七月召开了劳动就业问题的专门会议。兹将会议讨论研究的结果，综合起来，做如下的规定：
    （一）一切公私企业，均应遵守共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令，积极发展生产和营业。在国家即将开始的大规模经济建设中，一切适合国家和人民需要的公私企业都是有前途的。某些企业即令一时发生困难，也应从积极发展生产和营业中来克服本身的困难，不得从解雇职工上想办法，以保障职工利益，避免增加失业。解雇职工必须按工会法及其他有关法令的规定办理。
    一切公私企业，对于因实行生产改革、合理地提高了劳动效率而多余出来的职工，均应采取包下来的政策，仍由原企业单位发给原工资（计入企业成本之内），不得解雇。并应利用这种条件，进行分批轮训，提高他们的业务技术与政治文化水平，以备本企业扩大时使用或听候国家统一调配。这对鼓励职工创造发明和提出合理化建议的积极性也是有好处的。某些私营企业因经济改组关系，本行业确无前途必须转业者，原则上应该是劳动随资本同时转业。如果转业申请和计划开设的新业已得工商管理部门核准，又经过劳资双方协商，根据新业的计划和现有职工的条件拟出职工随资本转移的方案后，仍有一部分确实无法在新业中安置的职工，资方可按照工会法及其他有关法令的规定向劳动部门申请解雇，经劳动部门批准后，得依法解雇。某些私营企业确属亏本过甚，无力继续经营，经劳资协商后，仍无法开展业务，必须紧缩营业或歇业时，歇业应经工商管理部门批准，解雇一部或全部职工亦应经劳动部门批准；如将来再扩大营业或复业时，应尽先使原职工复工。
    劳动部门应根据目前情况，照顾劳资双方利益，慎重处理解雇问题。对于合情合理的解雇申请应予批准；对于假藉口实，企图解雇职工，或未经批准歇业，擅自停工、停薪、停伙者，均应坚决制止。
    工商管理部门为了稳定经济情况，减少失业现象，对于歇业、转业的申请固应慎重处理，对于开业的申请亦应注意掌握，确实了解申请者的资金情形、开业理由和业务计划等，以避免盲目开业、盲目歇业，结果造成失业的现象。为正确处理这些问题，大中城市的工商管理部门得设一谘询性质的委员会，邀请劳动部门、工会、工商业联合会及其他有关机关、团体参加。
    为保障职工健康，提高劳动生产率，并扩大就业面，应有计划有步骤地坚决贯彻八小时至十小时工作制，一切较大的公私营工矿交通运输企业均应尽可能实行八小时工作制。凡属有原料，有销路，技术条件许可者，可将现行的每日一班制或两班制改为每日两班制或三班制。大中城市和工矿区的国营商店、合作社也应尽可能实行八小时工作制。有害健康的工作，每日工作时间还应低于八小时。一切公私企业的加班加点，均应受严格的限制。
    对于失业工人，应普遍予以登记，并分别介绍就业或予以转业训练。对于不能即时就业或参加转业训练的失业工人，生活确实困难者，应采用“以工代赈”、“移民开垦”、“生产自救”等方法予以安置，或予以临时救济或长期救济。
    对于失业的和在业的职工家属中之劳动妇女及其他家庭劳动妇女，应尽可能根据原料和销路的条件，组织她们替工厂加工或进行其他手工业生产，并依据需要和可能吸收她们参加其他工作。
    （二）在知识分子问题上，基本情况是知识分子太少，不能适应国家大规模建设的需要。但是，目前在社会上却有一批失业知识分子，其中绝大部分是没有专门学识和技能的，这正是旧中国殖民地化的经济和旧的教育制度所造成的。他们的思想进步较慢，有些人开始有些觉悟，有些人还比较落后，还有些人政治历史情况确实比较复杂。他们大部是中年人，家庭拖累较多，一般不愿到农村，更不愿到边远地区工作，有些人如果到外地工作，家庭也确有困难。这一切都是他们未能早日获得就业机会的原因。其中也有一部分人，过去由于种种原因从来未参加过任何职业，家庭知识妇女在其中占很大比重。另一方面，过去某些企业和机关只愿意接受青年学生干部，而对吸收这些失业知识分子参加工作也有顾虑。现在必须打破这种顾虑，从实际出发，从全局出发，对现有失业知识分子采取广泛吸收、教育、改造、使用的方针；否则不能适应即将开始的大规模国家建设的迫切需要。特别是教育、卫生、贸易、合作等部门必须注意吸收这些失业知识分子，训练改造他们，使用他们，并在工作中继续改造他们；同时失业知识分子本身也应当认识自己思想上的缺点，努力改造自己。对一般历史上多少有些问题的人，只要他们忠诚老实地交代清楚，仍应采取教育、改造、使用的方针。对失业知识分子中少数可以投考高等学校或中等专业学校者，可以帮助他们投考，继续深造，以适应国家建设进一步发展的需要。
    失业知识分子中还有一批具有相当学识、在地方上有相当声望的人士，但因年老体弱，不能担任辛劳工作者，应采取适当办法，吸收他们参加适当工作，予以照顾。对一般年老力衰，完全失去工作能力生活确实困难的失业知识分子，亦应给以适当的救济。
    对于现在要求出来工作的知识分子出身的家庭妇女，还应特别照顾到她们大部分有家庭事务的拖累，逐步地有组织有计划地采取适当办法，吸收她们参加工作，譬如要她们半日工作或每天工作几小时，而给予一定的生活补助。这也是两利的办法。
    （三）国民党反动统治遗留在社会上的一大批旧军官、旧官吏，过去一般是反动统治的支持者，虽然有的人至今对人民政府尚存有对立情绪，但多数人在三年来人民伟大胜利的感召之下，已表示靠拢人民，愿意立功赎罪。
    旧军官、旧官吏中，大部分已还乡生产，在土地改革中分得了土地，从事农业劳动。他们还乡以后，一部分为当地群众所不满者，农民群众曾对他们加以管制监督，这是很自然的，也是正确的和必要的。不过，只要他们确实好好劳动生产或从事其他正当职业，遵守政府法令，没有任何反动行为，自当地解放之日起已满三年者，就应该经乡人民代表大会通过，县人民政府批准，改变他们旧军官、旧官吏的成份，按其所从事的劳动或职业的性质另订新的成份（兼地主成份者，自应按关于地主改变成份的规定处理）。流散在城市中的旧军官、旧官吏，有的生活有办法，有的已找到职业，但也有些人从事不正当的经营，还有一些人确实生活很困难。对后两种人，应该予以登记，采取教育、改造、使用的方针，有计划地分期分批地予以训练，改造他们，帮助他们转业，使他们从劳动中、工作中继续改造。同样，旧军官、旧官吏也应当努力改造自己，交代清楚自己的历史。凡政治历史问题不大且已真诚交代者，仍应采取教育、改造、使用的方针。少数高级旧军官、旧官吏，无法参加训练转业，而生活确实困难者，如果过去没有显著劣迹，民愤不大，在处理时亦应适当予以照顾。
    此外，在旧军官、旧官吏中还有一些人曾经参加过辛亥革命、北伐战争、抗日战争和起义后资遣还乡的，如果他们在历史上并无显著劣迹，处理时应优予照顾。
    （四）农村中大量的剩余劳动力不同于城市的失业半失业人员。他们是有饭吃有地种的。但他们有大量的潜在的劳动力没有发挥出来，应该积极设法使之发挥到生产上来。同时已耕的土地不足，在目前的技术条件下就不够种，进一步向前发展，定会产生更多的剩余劳动力。这是一个最根本的问题。因此，从根本打算，必须有计划有步骤地向东北、西北和西南地区移民，在不破坏水土保持及不妨害畜牧业发展的条件下，进行垦荒，扩大耕地面积。大量发展小型水利，变旱地为水地，改良种子，改良耕作技术，提倡精耕细作，提高单位面积产量。在人口密集的地区，也还有大量的废弃土地，如沙地、碱地、红土地等，经验证明是可以利用的，应组织农村剩余劳动力把这些废弃土地垦植起来。整修土地，改良土壤以及湖泊的蓄洪垦植与山地的水土保持工作等，亦应有计划地进行。
    此外，有计划地发展有销路的副业、手工业和农副产品的初步加工，植树造林，养鱼捕鱼，疏浚河道，修筑道路以及建设大型水利工程等，都是可以容纳大批剩余劳动力的，各主管部门应订出计划，因地制宜，逐步推行。尤其是合作总社，对既有利于国内销售又有利于出口的手工业品，应尽可能组织手工业生产合作社加以推广。
    必须积极开展组织起来，进行互助合作运动。在组织起来的基础上，移民垦荒、整修土地、进行小型水利等项工作，将更便于推行。
    城市与工业的发展，国家各方面建设的发展，将要从农村吸收整批的劳动力，但这一工作必须是有计划有步骤的进行，而且在短时期内不可能大量吸收。故必须大力说服农民，以克服农民盲目地向城市流动的情绪。
    （五）对散居在城市的少数民族居民的失业问题，目前主要是回民的失业半失业问题，必须切实注意帮助解决。他们由于风俗习惯与汉族不同，就业范围狭小，必须设法给以宽广的就业转业的机会，除零散地帮助他们就业外，最好是有计划地成批地吸收到工矿企业中去，并应极力尊重他们的风俗习惯。
    （六）对归国的难侨和贫苦侨民，必须有妥善的安置。侨务工作机关和当地民政机关对此应切实注意。必须充分利用一切机会，帮助他们找到职业，或者安置生产，切勿使他们失业失学，流离失所。其中一部分无劳动力、贫苦无依、生活困难者，必须切实予以救济。
    （七）社会上还有一批丧失劳动力贫苦无依的老弱残废和流浪儿童，应有计划地收容教养或分别予以救济。其中有部分尚可从事轻劳动者，亦可组织他们生产，补助生活。至对于有劳动力的游民乞丐，则应强迫劳动，条件可能时最好是集中收容，劳动改造。（八）城市中的一切失业人员，应统一办理登记。凡原在公私工商企业、交通、运输事业、手工作坊及机关、团体、学校中从事体力或脑力劳动的工人、职员以及无固定雇主的建筑工人、搬运工人，于失业后尚无固定职业者，季节性工人其行业已经衰落无法找到工作者，具有初中以上文化程度的知识分子而失业者，已停工歇业的独立生产者、行商摊贩、资方代理人及小工商业主，现确无其他收入，生活困难，要求就业从事雇佣劳动者，以及现在尚无职业的旧军官、旧官吏，生活困难，要求就业者，均一律进行登记。登记以后，根据不同情况，分别处理。一般应有计划地分批分期地予以训练，然后根据国家建设发展的需要与他们本人的条件，逐步解决他们的职业问题。为切合工作的需要，政治训练、就业训练和转业训练，一般均应由用人部门办理。失业人员登记以后，生活确属困难者，应适当予以救济。
    为统一解决劳动就业问题，进而逐步做到统一调配劳动力，中央、大行政区、省和大城市均应设立劳动就业委员会，并须建立有专人负责的办事机构，指导劳动部门及其他有关部门办理对一切失业人员的登记处理事宜。省辖市视工作需要，报经省人民政府批准后，亦得设立劳动就业委员会。
    总之，处理城市的失业半失业人员的就业问题，处理城乡巨量剩余劳动力的问题，必须根据国家建设的需要，从全局设想、从实际出发、从长远打算着眼、从当前要办能办的事着手，才能逐步做到消灭失业，并有计划地使城乡剩余劳动力能以充分发挥其潜在的劳动能力，为国家为社会创造更多的财富，促进国家的经济建设及其他各项建设的更加向前发展。
