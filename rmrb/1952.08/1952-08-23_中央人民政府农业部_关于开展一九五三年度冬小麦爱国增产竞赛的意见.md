    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government
    Opinions on Launching the 1953 Winter Wheat Patriotic Production Increase Competition

    1.  Wheat is one of China's main commercial grains. With the increasing development of economic construction and national defense, and the improvement of people's lives, the country's need for wheat is growing. Increasing wheat production is extremely important. The leading organs in all winter wheat producing areas should launch the 1953 winter wheat patriotic production increase competition as early as possible, fully prepare for sowing, and strive for a bumper harvest next summer.

    2.  The launch of the competition should be based on state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams, absorbing individual farmers to participate, and actively driving them to organize. After the nationwide challenge is initiated, the province will organize a bumper harvest banner to respond to the challenge and challenge the entire province. Then, the competition will be widely launched with the county as a unit. Strive to simplify the levels, quickly implement, and strive to complete the mobilization half a month before the autumn harvest, giving participating units sufficient time to prepare.

    The form of competition should be suitable for attracting the participation of the vast number of farmers. First, organize competitions between villages or districts to fully mobilize. Then, organize farmers within a district or village to find objects with similar conditions, discuss competition conditions face-to-face, and widely launch competitions between cooperatives, teams, and households. In major winter wheat producing areas, strive to involve more than half of the farmers in the movement.

    State-owned farms can organize several competition groups within the scope of large administrative regions or provinces, stipulate competition conditions, and launch competitions. Competitions should also be organized among employees within the farm.

    3.  The conditions of the competition should focus on universally improving the yield per unit area. First, compete for the average yield of the entire winter wheat sown area. Secondly, compete for high yields or new records. New records should be based on the original highest winter wheat yields in the country and various regions as standards, and strive to break through. The area for setting high yields and new records can refer to the award-winning area in the "Interim Measures for Rewarding Bumper Harvests" of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in 1952, which will be promulgated soon. Competition conditions, except for new records, should be divided into several standards from low to high, so that farmers with poor production conditions have the possibility to participate in the competition.

    The production increase plan should be active and feasible. The content should be simple, specific, and easy to grasp. The yield should be adapted to the production increase methods. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to fully discuss, explore potential production forces, find ways to increase production, and implement the advanced experience of bumper harvest models into the plan. Summarizing and promoting advanced bumper harvest experience is one of the central contents of the patriotic production increase competition, and should be carried out actively, in a planned and step-by-step manner, to improve winter wheat cultivation methods in all aspects. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government will soon promulgate guiding documents on winter wheat bumper harvest technology, which can be implemented with reference to local conditions. Adequate estimates and sufficient material preparations should be made for possible droughts, floods, winds, freezing, and pests.

    4.  Strengthen the leadership of the winter wheat patriotic production increase competition. First of all, in-depth patriotic education should be carried out to reverse the tendency of "emphasizing cotton and neglecting wheat" in wheat and cotton producing areas, and ensure the implementation of the national winter wheat sowing plan. Combine production with politics, and create a patriotic production increase upsurge in rural areas. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government intends to continue to implement the current method for the award-winning area for the 1953 winter wheat bumper harvest award. Localities should promulgate winter wheat bumper harvest award standards, combined with typical bumper harvest stories, widely publicize, and actively guide the masses to strive for increased production.

    Secondly, autumn work is extremely busy. Localities should be presided over by the chief leaders personally, establish an autumn appraisal committee, strengthen organizational leadership, properly arrange various autumn tasks, and lead state-owned farms and rural cooperative mutual aid organizations to rectify before the autumn harvest, formulate autumn work plans, cooperate in allocating labor and livestock, arrange farm work, improve labor efficiency, and ensure that winter wheat sowing is timely and well-sown, laying the foundation for increased production.

    Finally, change the habit of extensive winter wheat cultivation. After sowing, organize topdressing, irrigation, and disaster prevention by season, carry out seasonal competitions and appraisals, and ensure the realization of the production increase plan. Next summer harvest, launch a mass appraisal movement, earnestly summarize according to the competition conditions, and reward bumper harvest models.

### 中央人民政府农业部  关于开展一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛的意见

    中央人民政府农业部
    关于开展一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛的意见
    一、小麦为我国主要商品粮食之一，随着经济建设和国防事业日益发展，加以人民生活改善，国家对小麦的需要与日俱增。增产小麦是极其重要的。各冬小麦产区的领导机关应及早发动一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛，充分做好播种前的准备工作，争取明年夏季丰收。
    二、竞赛的发动，应以国营农场、农业生产合作社和互助组为基础，吸收个体农民参加，并积极带动他们组织起来。全国性挑战发起后，由省组织丰产旗帜应战，并向全省挑战，随即以县为单位普遍展开。力求简化层次，迅速贯彻，争取于秋收前半月发动完毕，给参加单位以充分时间进行准备。
    竞赛形式，应该适合于吸收广大农民参加。首先要组织村与村或区与区之间的竞赛，全面发动。然后要在一区、一村内组织农民，自找条件相近的对象，当面商定竞赛条件，普遍展开社与社、组与组和户与户之间的竞赛。在主要冬小麦产区，要争取半数以上的农户参加到运动中来。
    国营农场可以大行政区或省为范围，根据条件组织几个竞赛集团，规定竞赛条件，展开竞赛。农场内部职工之间也应组织竞赛。
    三、竞赛的条件应集中在普遍提高单位面积产量上。首先要比赛冬小麦全部播种面积的平均产量。其次可比赛高额产量或新纪录。新纪录应以全国和各地原有冬小麦最高产量分别作为标准，争取突破。划定高额产量和新纪录的面积，可参照即将公布的中央人民政府农业部一九五二年丰产奖励暂行办法中的获奖面积。竞赛条件，除新纪录以外，都应由低到高，分别层次，提出几种标准，要使生产条件较差的农民有参加竞赛的可能。
    增产计划应该是积极的，而又是可能实现的。内容要简单具体，易于掌握。产量应与增产办法相适应。要发动群众充分讨论，发掘生产潜在力量，找寻增产门路，把丰产模范们的先进经验贯彻到计划中去。总结与推广先进的丰产经验，是爱国增产竞赛中心内容之一，应该积极地有计划有步骤地进行，从各方面改进冬小麦的耕作方法。中央人民政府农业部即将公布冬小麦丰产技术的指导性文件，各地可参照执行。对可能遭遇到的旱、涝、风、冻及病虫等灾害，应作足够估计和充分的物质准备。
    四、要加强冬小麦爱国增产竞赛的领导。首先应深入进行爱国主义教育，扭转麦、棉产区“重棉轻麦”的偏向，保证执行国家冬小麦播种计划。把生产与政治结合起来，在农村中掀起爱国增产热潮。中央人民政府农业部对于一九五三年度冬小麦丰产奖励的获奖面积，仍拟按今年办法执行，各地应颁布冬小麦丰产奖励标准，结合丰产典型事迹，广为宣传，积极引导群众争取增产。
    其次，秋季工作极其繁忙，各地应由首长亲自主持，成立秋季评比委员会，加强组织领导，妥善安排秋季各种工作，领导国营农场和农村合作互助组织，在秋收之前进行整顿，制订秋季工作计划，合作调配劳畜力，安排农活，提高劳动效率，保证冬麦播种工作适时、种好，打下增产基础。
    最后，要改变冬小麦耕作粗放的习惯。播种之后要按季节组织追肥、灌溉及防治灾害，开展季节性竞赛与评比，保证实现增产计划。明年夏收时要发动群众性评比运动，认真按竞赛条件进行总结，并奖励丰产模范。
