    Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 31st – Li Dequan, Chief Representative of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, spoke at the General Committee meeting of the International Red Cross Conference on the morning of the 29th, exposing the true face of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The full text of the speech is as follows:
    The Chinese delegation believes that, according to the Geneva Conventions, the International Committee of the Red Cross, under the Red Cross flag, is not an impartial and neutral organization. The whole world knows that tens of thousands of peaceful residents in Korea have been subjected to massacres by the armies of a Western country. Many undefended cities and villages have been destroyed and bombed. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which claims to be able to work freely in cooperation with the invading forces in South Korea, has neither reported nor exposed these crimes. When a fact-finding mission organized by the Women's International Democratic Federation presented the International Committee of the Red Cross with evidence of civilian massacres, the International Committee of the Red Cross refused to investigate.
    It is known that in the POW camps on Geoje Island, Busan, Yeongcheon, and Nonsan, the POWs did not abandon their right to repatriation. All the POWs have long suffered torture, repression, and collective massacre. Even yesterday, the newspapers here published these messages. The representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross stationed in South Korea, having seen these crimes, has never exposed them, but instead claimed that the situation in the POW camps was good.
    The whole world knows that the International Committee of the Red Cross once covered up the brutal crimes of the Nazi concentration camps, deceiving the Allied countries. Today, the International Committee of the Red Cross is inheriting its shameful history and using the same methods to deceive the mothers and women of Korea, saying that the conditions in the POW camps are good. Look, this is its impartiality and neutrality.
    Facts have proved that the International Committee of the Red Cross is not an impartial and neutral organization. It has degenerated into a tool for concealing crimes and an obstacle to the Red Cross movement. The Chinese delegation cannot agree with the report of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
    Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 31st – Li Dequan, Chief Representative of the Chinese Red Cross delegation to the 18th International Red Cross Conference, spoke at the General Committee of the Conference on the afternoon of July 29 during discussions on the draft amendments to the International Red Cross Statute. The full text of the speech is as follows:
    The Chinese delegation fully agrees with the amendments proposed by the Red Cross Societies of Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union regarding the review of the draft International Red Cross Statutes and Rules.
    The Chinese delegation insists that the conference adopt the amendments, and that the spirit of the statutes should be reasonable and democratic.
    The International Committee of the Red Cross occupies a position of supreme power, far exceeding its status. The International Committee of the Red Cross is a Swiss organization composed entirely of Swiss citizens and is an organization on an equal footing with the Red Cross Societies of other countries. However, according to the draft statutes, the International Committee of the Red Cross consistently occupies a position higher than that of the Red Cross Societies of all countries. In particular, Article 7 of the draft statutes stipulates that the International Committee of the Red Cross has the power to recognize new Red Cross Societies, which violates democratic principles. Only the Red Cross Association, composed of the Red Cross Societies of all countries, has this power. The amendments proposed by the four Red Cross Societies are fair and necessary. All international organizations should be based on democratic principles, and the International Red Cross organization is no exception. If the International Red Cross organization is not democratic, it will not be an international, independent, impartial organization. The International Committee of the Red Cross occupies a position of supreme power, which is not in line with democratic principles. Why does it enjoy such rights?
    During the Second World War, the activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross violated humanitarian principles. It has lost its neutrality and impartiality. Its attitude towards the Korean War clearly proves this. The clauses in the draft statutes concerning the privileged position of the International Committee of the Red Cross should be amended in accordance with the suggestions of the four countries.
    Based on the above reasons, the Chinese delegation believes that the purpose of the four Red Cross Societies' amendments is to strengthen the International Red Cross organization and make it a democratic and worldwide organization. The Chinese delegation warmly supports the amendments and requests that they be adopted in their entirety.
    Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 31st – On the 29th, the International Red Cross Conference held separate meetings of various committees.
    At the meeting of the General Committee, Ruegger, the Chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross, made a report on the activities of the organization, shamelessly and deceptively promoting its "impartiality" and "neutrality." Representatives of the Red Cross Societies of the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania spoke in succession after Ruegger's report, listing various facts since World War II to illustrate how the International Committee of the Red Cross had tacitly condoned the atrocities committed in Nazi concentration camps. In particular, in Korea, tens of thousands of peaceful residents in North Korea were massacred by the American invaders, and scenes of terror, abuse, and massacres occurred everywhere in the POW camps in South Korea. However, the International Committee of the Red Cross has never revealed these facts to the world, nor has it condemned these inhuman acts. Soviet representative Slavin said: "If we examine what this organization has done to alleviate human suffering, we can find that it has not followed the humanitarian traditions of the Red Cross, but has only been keen on covering up the crimes of war criminals." He also said: This committee calls itself an international committee, but this is not the case. In fact, it is just an organization of Swiss people. Ruegger and his assistants were in a terrible predicament. The two of them spoke several times in a row, but could only stammeringly say: "The International Committee of the Red Cross does not intend to make a defense reply because none of these accusations have been substantiated." Chairman François-Poncet (France) repeatedly used his all-powerful weapon: "Don't talk about politics!" in an attempt to prevent the representatives of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries from speaking, but without success.
    Next, the Soviet representative suggested that the conference not adopt the report of the International Committee of the Red Cross because it was complete nonsense. He said that the conference should not decide to provide any financial assistance to this committee, and he suggested amending the International Red Cross Statute to abolish the unreasonable provisions that give the International Committee of the Red Cross absurd rights—such as the right to recognize the Red Cross organizations of various countries and handle violations of the Geneva Conventions. This motion was supported by the delegations of China, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Korea. Seeing that no one at the meeting could accuse the Soviet motion of being incorrect, the chairman, under the behind-the-scenes direction of the United States, hurriedly started the voting machine and unreasonably rejected the aforementioned Soviet motion.

### 中苏等国代表在国际红十字大会上  斥责红十字国际委员会掩饰战犯罪行

    中苏等国代表在国际红十字大会上
    斥责红十字国际委员会掩饰战犯罪行
    【新华社多伦多三十一日电】中国红十字会代表团首席代表李德全在二十九日上午国际红十字大会总务委员会会议上发言，揭露红十字国际委员会的面目。发言全文如下：
    中国代表团认为依照日内瓦公约，在红十字旗帜下的红十字国际委员会不是一个公正无私的中立机构。全世界都知道朝鲜的成万和平居民遭到一个西方国家军队的集体屠杀。许多不设防的城市和村庄遭到破坏和轰炸。自称在南朝鲜和侵略军队合作时能自由工作的红十字国际委员会，对这些罪行却不报告也不揭发。当国际民主妇女联合会组织的调查团向红十字国际委员会提出屠杀平民的证据时，红十字国际委员会却拒绝进行调查。
    人们知道：在巨济岛、釜山、永川、论山的战俘营内，战俘们都不放弃他们的遣返的权利。所有的战俘长期地遭受酷刑、镇压、集体屠杀的迫害，就在昨天，此间报纸还发表这些消息。驻南朝鲜的红十字国际委员会代表，见到这些罪行，从来没有揭发过，反而声称战俘营里的情况良好。
    全世界都知道红十字国际委员会曾经掩盖过希特勒战俘营的残酷罪行，欺骗各盟国。今天，红十字国际委员会继承它可耻的历史，又在使用同一方法来欺骗朝鲜的母亲和妇女，说战俘营的情况是良好的。看，这就是它的公正无私和中立。
    事实证明：红十字国际委员会不是一个公正无私的中立机构。它已堕落到变为掩盖罪行的工具，成为红十字运动的障碍。中国代表团不能同意红十字国际委员会的报告。
    【新华社多伦多三十一日电】中国红十字会参加第十八届国际红十字大会代表团首席代表李德全七月二十九日下午在大会总务委员会上讨论国际红十字章程草案修正案时发言。发言全文如下：
    中国代表团完全同意波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、苏联各国红十字会所提出的关于审查国际红十字章程和规则草案的修正案。
    中国代表团坚持大会通过修正案，章程的精神应该是合理的、民主的。
    红十字国际委员会占据着最高权力的地位，大大地超过了它的身份。红十字国际委员会是一个完全由瑞士公民组成的瑞士机构，并且是和其他各国的红十字会处于平等地位的机构，然而根据章程的草案，红十字国际委员会就始终占据着高于各国红十字会的地位。特别是章程草案的第七条规定红十字国际委员会有权承认新的红十字会，这是违反民主原则的。只有由所有各国红十字会组成的红十字会协会才有这种权力。四国红十字会提出的修正案是公平的、必要的。一切国际组织都应建立在民主的原则上，红十字国际组织自不能例外。假如红十字国际机构不是民主的，就不成为一个国际的独立的公正无私的机构了。红十字国际委员会占据着最高权力的地位，和民主的原则不相符合。为什么它享有这样的权利呢？
    在第二次世界大战中，红十字国际委员会的活动是违背人道原则的。它已丧失了中立性和公正无私的立场。它对朝鲜战争的态度格外明显地证明了这点。章程草案中有关红十字国际委员会特权地位的各条款应当按照四国的建议予以修改。
    根据上述的理由，中国代表团认为四国红十字会修正案的目的是在加强国际红十字组织，使它成为民主的和全世界的组织。中国代表团热烈地支持修正案，并要求全部通过这个修正案。
    【新华社多伦多三十一日电】二十九日，国际红十字大会由各委员会分别举行会议。
    在总务委员会的会议上，红十字国际委员会主席吕格作了该机构活动的报告，无耻而欺骗地宣传其
    “公正”和“中立”。苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚红十字会代表在吕格报告后，相继发言，列举第二次世界大战以来的种种事实，说明红十字国际委员会曾经怎样点头默许纳粹集中营施行暴行的情况，尤其这次在朝鲜，千千万万朝鲜北部的和平居民遭到美国侵略者屠杀，南朝鲜的战俘营里到处发生恐怖的威胁、虐待和大屠杀，但是，红十字国际委员会却从来没有把这些事实向全世界揭露，也没有谴责这是不人道的行为。苏联代表司拉文说：“假如我们考查一下这机构曾做了些什么减轻人类痛苦的工作，我们便可以发觉，它并没有遵从红十字会的人道传统，而仅是热中于替战争罪犯掩饰罪行。”他又说：这个委员会自称为国际的委员会，然而事实并不是这样的。事实上，它不过是一批瑞士人的组织罢了。吕格和他的助手狼狈不堪，他们两人曾经一连好几次发言，但是，只能支吾其词地说：“红十字国际委员会不打算作申辩的答复，因为这些指责没有一项是证实了的。”主席法朗索阿—庞赛（法国）曾一再用出他那万能武器：“不要谈政治！”企图阻止苏联、中国和其他国家的代表发言，但是都没有成功。
    接着，苏联代表建议大会不要通过红十字国际委员会的报告，因为这完全是一套废话。他说：大会不应决定对这委员会给予任何财政援助，他并建议修改国际红十字章程，取消其中赋与红十字国际委员会以荒唐权利——如由它承认各国的红十字会组织并处理违犯日内瓦公约事宜——的不合理规定。这个动议获得中国、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、朝鲜代表团的支持。眼看着会议上没有人能够指责苏联的动议有什么不正确，受美国在幕后指使的主席就急急忙忙开动表决机器，无理地否决了上述苏联的动议。
