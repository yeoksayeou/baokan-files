        Timely and Thorough Inspection of Patriotic Increase Production Movement Should Be Conducted in All Areas
        ——Summary of Readers' Letters

    Some readers' letters reflect the situation that the patriotic increase production movement has not yet been launched in some areas. At the same time, they expose the formalism of certain cadres and the bad behavior of making false reports. Now, two letters are selected and published to draw everyone's attention.
    Xie Guocheng and Jiang Linxiu from the Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Lucheng County Committee in Shanxi Province wrote that Taitong Village in Lucheng District 1 was originally a typical village in the district for patriotic increase production. The village has 225 households and 3,840 mu of land. On July 22, Lucheng District 1 held an inspection conference on the patriotic increase production movement, attended by more than 70 people, including the main cadres, labor models, mutual aid team leaders, and technicians from various villages. The secretary of the CPC Taitong Village Branch made a report at the meeting on "How to lead the patriotic increase production competition and ensure the realization of production increase tasks." He said that the masses in Taitong Village had high confidence in increasing production. There were 16 mutual aid teams in the village, including six high-yield teams and twelve high-yield households. These teams and households paid attention to farming techniques, applying 15 more dan of fertilizer per mu than last year, and generally harrowing the land three times and raking it three times. After listening to his report, the participants formed five inspection teams, including field observation and individual interviews, to conduct on-site inspections in Taitong Village. The results showed that the actual situation was completely different from the report.
    Out of the 191 female laborers in the village, none participated in agricultural production. Many farmers did not know what patriotic increase production was about (the inspection team interviewed eight people, and five of them did not know). Some middle peasants still had ideological concerns that "increasing production would increase the burden." The farmers in the village did not actively improve their farming techniques, and no one in the village tried new farm tools. Only half of the village's farmland had been hoed twice. The amount of fertilizer applied was indeed large, averaging more than 200 dan per mu, but it was all applied at once. The farmers in the village generally believed that "grain can be harvested without paying attention to technology."
    Chen Yuntian from the People's Government of Leting County, Hebei Province, wrote that the inspection team sent by the Tangshan Special District Patriotic Increase Production Competition Evaluation Committee to Leting County inspected the patriotic increase production competition movement in Caigezhuang Village, Leting District 1, on July 27. This village has 2,005 mu of cultivated land and 209 households, of which 26 households formed six long-term mutual aid teams, 85 households formed 20 temporary mutual aid teams, and 98 households were "going it alone."
    The village cadres said that 70% of the farmers in the village had made production increase plans. The actual situation was that some teams had made plans, but only a few team members knew about these plans. The household plans were generally made by men, and the women did not know about them. Some of the six long-term mutual aid teams did not evaluate work, and some did not calculate work points, so the production enthusiasm of the team members was not high. Some people formally joined the mutual aid teams, but in reality, they were still working alone. Many farmers were still worried that increasing production would increase the burden. For example, farmer Zhao Xicang's "production increase plan" stated that his land's annual output was 60 jin per mu, and this year it would be increased to 100 jin; in fact, the annual output of his land was already more than 100 jin. The cadres and party members in the village were mostly immersed in production and did not care about politics. According to Comrade Wu Jitai, the secretary of the CPC District Committee of this district, "The village branch has not held a meeting in a year, and most of the village cadres are pushed to move, and they don't move without being pushed." Therefore, the patriotic increase production competition movement in the village has not really been launched.
    Readers' letters said that the CPC Lucheng County Committee in Shanxi Province has instructed all districts to learn from the lessons of Taitong Village and conduct a general and in-depth inspection of the patriotic increase production movement to overcome bureaucratic work styles; the leading organs of Leting County, Hebei Province, have also sent capable cadres to Caigezhuang Village to strengthen the leadership of the production increase competition movement.
    Readers suggest that the leading organs in various places should promptly inspect the patriotic increase production movement so that this movement can be better developed.

### 各地应该及时深入检查爱国增产运动——读者来信综述

    各地应该及时深入检查爱国增产运动
    ——读者来信综述
    有些读者来信反映了若干地区的爱国增产运动还没有开展起来的情况，同时揭发了某些干部形式主义的作风和作假报告的恶劣行为。现在选择两封信发表出来，以便引起大家的注意。
    中共山西潞城县委员会办公室谢过成、江潾秀来信说，潞城一区台东村原是全区的爱国增产典型村，该村有二百二十五户，三千八百四十亩地。七月二十二日，潞城一区召开了包括各村主要干部、劳动模范、互助组长、技术员共七十多人的爱国增产运动检查大会，中共台东村支部书记在会上作了“如何领导爱国增产竞赛运动，保证实现增产任务”的报告。他说，台东村群众增产信心很高。全村共有十六个互助组，就有六个丰产组，十二个丰产户。这些组、户都很讲究耕作技术，每亩地比去年多施肥十五担，一般土地都耙了三遍，耢了三遍。”参加会议的人听完了他的报告，便组成田间察看、个别访问等五个检查小组，到台东村实地检查。结果发现实际情况和报告的完全不一样。
    该村共有一百九十一个妇女劳动力，根本没有参加农业生产。许多农民还不知道爱国增产是怎么回事（检查组访问八个群众，就有五个不知道）。有些中农还有“增产便要增加负担”的思想顾虑。该村的农民并没有积极改进耕作技术，全村没有一个人试用新农具。全村只有一半的耕地锄过两遍。施肥量的确很多，每亩平均在二百担以上，但都是一次施上的。该村的农民还普遍认为“不讲究技术一样能打粮食”。
    河北乐亭县人民政府陈云田来信说：唐山专区爱国增产竞赛评比委员会派到乐亭县的检查组，在七月二十七日检查了乐亭一区蔡各庄村的爱国增产竞赛运动。这村有二千零五亩耕地，二百零九户，其中有二十六户组成六个长年互助组，八十五户组成了二十个临时互助组、还有九十八户是“单干”的。
    该村干部说，全村有百分之七十的农民订了增产计划。实际情况是有些组订了计划，但只有少数组员知道这些计划。户的计划一般是男人订的，妇女们都不知道。六个长年互助组有的不评工，有的不计工，组员的生产积极性并不高。有些人形式上参加了互助组，实际上还是单干。不少农民还顾虑增加生产要增加负担。例如，农民赵希仓的“增产计划”上说他的土地常年产量是每亩六十斤，今年要增至一百斤；实际上他的土地的常年产量已在一百斤以上。该村的干部、党员多是埋头生产，不问政治。据这个区中共区委书记吴季太同志说：“村支部一年来没有开过会，大部分村干部是推推动动，不推不动。”因此，该村的爱国增产竞赛运动并没有真正开展起来。
    读者来信说，中共山西潞城县委员会已指示各区接受台东村的教训，普遍而深入地检查一次爱国增产运动的情况，克服官僚主义作风；河北乐亭县的领导机关也已派遣得力干部到蔡各庄村加强增产竞赛运动的领导。
    读者建议各地领导机关及时检查爱国增产运动的情况，以便使这一运动更好地开展起来。
