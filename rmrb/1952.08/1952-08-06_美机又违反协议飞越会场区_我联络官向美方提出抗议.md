Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 5th - US aircraft violated the agreement again on the 4th by flying over the Panmunjom conference area. Our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, lodged a protest with the US liaison officer on the 5th regarding this matter. Between 7:20 PM and 8:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th, US jet aircraft flew over the balloons marking the conference area three times in succession. The weather was excellent at the time, and the US aircraft flying over could be seen clearly. Each time an overflight occurred, the duty police of our side at the Joint Office of the Security Officers of the Conference Area requested the duty police of the US side to jointly inspect the situation. However, the duty police of the US side, in violation of the past agreement between the two sides, refused to jointly inspect. Two days before this incident of deliberate US sabotage of the agreement, namely on August 2nd, the US side shelled the Panmunjom conference area.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 5th - Alan Winnington, correspondent for the British Daily Worker, reported: US jets flew three times last night between the US balloons marking the Panmunjom conference area. This provocative action, violating the neutral zone agreement, followed the event the day before when the US military again forced the negotiations to adjourn for another week at Harrison and shelled the conference area. It is now evident that the US side seems to be playing a new trick – in addition to their usual tactics of trying to make Panmunjom cease to be a conference area, they are adding the scheme of trying to make the negotiations fall into a state of quasi-permanent adjournment. A US military police captain, full of airs and graces, responsible for the security of Panmunjom, refused to conduct an investigation when notified by the captain of the Korean military police to conduct a joint investigation. This fact clearly shows that both incidents of violating the neutral zone agreement and the refusal of the US military police to investigate were carried out on orders from higher authorities; otherwise, no captain would dare to refuse to handle normal procedures. Many people personally witnessed three jets, then two, and finally one jet streaking across the neutral zone.

    美机又违反协议飞越会场区
    我联络官向美方提出抗议
    【新华社开城五日电】美机四日又违反协议，飞越板门店会场区。我方首席联络官张春山上校五日就此事向美方联络官提出抗议。四日下午七时二十分到八时之间，美方喷气式飞机连续三次从标志会场区的汽球之间飞过。当时天气极好，可以清楚地看见飞越的美机。会场区安全军官联合办事处我方值班警察在每次飞越发生时，都要求美方值班警察共同视察。而美方值班警察竟违反过去双方的协议，拒绝共同视察。在这一次美方蓄意破坏协议事件发生前两天，即八月二日，美方曾炮击板门店会场区。
    【新华社开城五日电】英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿报道：美国喷气机昨晚三度从标志着板门店会议区的美国汽球中间飞过去。这个违反中立区协议的挑衅行动，是紧接着美军在哈利逊再度强使谈判休会一周的前一天炮轰会议区的事件以后发生的。现在看得出来：美方似乎在耍一套新花样——在他们那一套设法使板门店不成其为会议区的惯技以外，再加上他们想使谈判陷于类乎永久休会状态的诡计。美方负责板门店安全的一个臭架子十足的军事警察上尉，在接到朝鲜军事警察队长要他共同进行调查的通知的时候，竟然拒绝调查。这个事实明确地说明了：两次违反中立区协议的事件，以及美方军事警察拒绝调查，都是奉高级方面的命令行事的，否则没有一个上尉敢于拒绝办理正常的手续。有许多人亲眼看见了三架喷气机，后来是两架最后又是一架喷气机，一溜飞过中立区。
