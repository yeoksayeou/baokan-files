Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th. Our special correspondent reports: The U.S. side's recent propaganda about "intensifying the bombing" of seventy-eight cities in North Korea is seen here as a major part of Washington's conspiracy to stifle the armistice negotiations through a lengthy recess and to undermine the armistice negotiations by taking provocative actions outside the conference tent.

The key issue at Panmunjom now is no longer to put forward specific proposals, but to implement the principles of the draft armistice agreement unanimously agreed upon by both sides. Despite the obstructionist tactics adopted by the U.S. side, which have dragged the negotiations on for more than thirteen months, all articles of the 63-clause draft armistice agreement have been agreed upon, and the agreement can come into effect as soon as both sides sign it. The only remaining obstacle now is the U.S. side's refusal to allow all prisoners of war to return home to a peaceful life in accordance with the provisions of the already agreed-upon terms.

Authoritative sources said: The sooner the war planners in Washington abandon their illusions of forcing our side to accept their conditions at the negotiating table, the sooner an armistice in Korea can be achieved. Neither the walkout disruption tactics nor the so-called military pressure can make the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers "yield" to the U.S. demand to forcibly detain prisoners of war, including more than 13,000 Chinese prisoners of war.

Authoritative sources pointed out: The United States military has already been defeated in its first large-scale military confrontation with the liberated people of Asia. Their plan of aggression has been crushed in Korea. If they insist on disrupting the armistice negotiations and destroying the hope for an armistice in Korea, the question is how deep they are prepared to sink into the quagmire of failure.

The most important point that the U.S. propaganda about bombing refuses to reveal to the world is that these bombings are mainly aimed at North Korean civilians.

The U.S. government's war of intervention has become a war against the old, weak, women, and children in the rear of Korea. The U.S. troops on the front lines do not dare to attack the fortified and increasingly powerful Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, because the casualties suffered by the U.S. military are heavy.

The U.S. representatives' political blackmail with the lives of prisoners of war at the recent administrative meeting of the delegation was unsuccessful. Now, they are attempting to achieve Washington's ulterior motives with the lives of unarmed Korean women and children. According to incomplete figures up to May of this year, 18,000 Korean children under the age of fourteen have died as a result of U.S. bombing. Recently, in the much-publicized U.S. bombing of Pyongyang, more than 10,000 civilians were killed and injured, most of whom were women and children. This is what the "New York Times" editorial calls "destroying as much as our air force can destroy."

People can see how despicable the U.S.'s large-scale bombing and massacre of civilians is from the following prominent facts.

(1) More than two years of war have proved that no matter how the U.S. Air Force bombs and strafes, it cannot cut off the transportation and supply lines of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Van Fleet had to admit that bombing and strafing could not stop the growth of the military strength of the Korean-Chinese side. The United States has suffered heavy losses in personnel and aircraft in this failed attempt, especially in the past two months. The increasing losses of their air force show that the powerful anti-aircraft artillery and the growing air force of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have made U.S. air strikes on military targets dangerous and costly.

(2) The Pentagon has admitted the vulnerability of the United States on the ground. The U.S. military could not reach the Yalu River and was driven back to the 38th parallel. They suffered a tragic defeat in last summer and autumn's offensives, with heavy losses, and have made no progress on the battlefield since then.

(3) In the face of the powerful coastal defense artillery and troops of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the U.S. Navy has proven to be ineffective. Recent U.S. news has had to admit the loss of four warships and severe damage to an aircraft carrier.

From the above, people can see that the bankrupt U.S. "military pressure" is reduced to indiscriminately bombing non-military targets, leveling peaceful towns and slaughtering Korean women and children, completely disregarding the Geneva Convention.

It is pointed out here that forcing the armistice negotiations to recess, slaughtering Korean women and children, and provocative actions such as bombing and strafing Chinese cities, etc., have exposed to the world that the United States is unwilling to resolve the only remaining prisoner of war issue on an equal footing. These provocative actions by the United States are part of Washington's conspiracy to stifle the armistice negotiations and expand the war. The Chinese and Korean people have seen through this conspiracy and are united closely to resolutely strike the arrogant U.S. aggressors until they have to abandon their conspiracy.

### 我方人士揭穿美方叫嚣轰炸朝鲜城市的阴谋  指出美方破产的“军事压力”所剩内容仅是屠杀朝鲜妇孺

    我方人士揭穿美方叫嚣轰炸朝鲜城市的阴谋
    指出美方破产的“军事压力”所剩内容仅是屠杀朝鲜妇孺
    【新华社开城十七日电】本社特派记者报道：美方最近宣传说将“加紧轰炸”北朝鲜的七十八个城市，此间认为这是华盛顿用长期休会扼杀停战谈判和在会议帐篷外面采取挑衅行为以破坏停战谈判的阴谋的一个主要部分。
    目前板门店的关键问题不再是提具体建议，而是履行双方一致同意的停战协定草案的原则。尽管美方采取阻挠手段，使谈判拖了十三个多月，可是包含六十三款的停战协定草案的各条都已得到协议，只要双方一签字，协定就可生效了。现在剩下的最后一个障碍是美方不肯按照已经取得协议的条款的规定，让全部战俘回家过和平生活。
    权威人士说：华盛顿的战争策划者越早放弃他们怀抱着的在谈判席上强迫我方接受他们条件的幻想，朝鲜停战就越早可以取得。逃会的破坏策略也好，所谓军事压力也好，都不能使朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军向美国强迫拘留战俘的要求“屈服”，这些战俘中有一万三千多名中国战俘。
    权威人士指出：美国军队在和被解放了的亚洲人民第一次大规模的军事交锋中已经打败了。他们的侵略计划在朝鲜已被粉碎了。如果他们坚持破坏停战谈判并摧毁朝鲜停战希望的话，问题是他们准备陷入到失败的泥淖里多么深。
    美国关于轰炸的宣传中不肯向世人道破的极重要的一点是：这些轰炸主要是对付北朝鲜平民的。
    美国政府所进行的干涉战争已变成对后方的朝鲜老弱妇孺进行的战争。前线上的美军部队不敢向工事坚固、火力日益强大的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军进攻，因为美军所遭受的伤亡是惨重的。
    美方代表在最近的代表团行政性会议上以战俘的生命进行政治敲诈没有成功。现在，他们企图以赤手空拳的朝鲜妇孺的生命来达到华盛顿不可告人的目的。根据到今年五月为止的不完全数字，已有一万八千名十四岁以下的朝鲜儿童死于美国轰炸之下。最近，在美国对平壤进行的大吹大擂的轰炸中，有一万多平民被炸死和炸伤，其中大多数是妇孺。这就是“纽约时报”社论所说的“我们的空军能毁灭多少就毁灭多少”。
    人们从下面的突出事实中可以看到美方大规模轰炸屠杀平民是多么卑怯。
    （一）两年多的战争证明了美国空军随便怎样轰炸和扫射都不能切断朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的交通与供应线。范佛里特也不得不承认轰炸与扫射并不能制止朝中方面军事实力的增长。美国在这个失败了的尝试中特别在过去两个月内蒙受了在兵员和飞机方面的惨重损失。他们空军的损失越来越大，这说明了朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军强大的高射炮火与日益壮大的空军使美国空军袭击军事目标变成了很危险、代价很大的事情。
    （二）五角大楼已承认美国在地面上的脆弱。美军打不到鸭绿江，而且被逐回三八线。他们在去年夏季与秋季的攻势中遭到了悲惨的失败，损失重大，从那以后他们在战场上一直毫无进展。
    （三）在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军强大的海防炮与部队面前，美国海军已证明起不了作用。美国最近的消息不得不承认损失了四艘战舰，一艘航空母舰受重创。
    人们从以上这些可以看到，美国的破了产的“军事压力”所剩下的内容仅仅是滥炸非军事目标、夷平和平城镇与屠杀朝鲜妇孺而完全置日内瓦公约于不顾。
    此间指出：强行使停战谈判休会、屠杀朝鲜妇孺与轰炸扫射中国城市的挑衅行动等等，使美国向全世界暴露了他们并不愿在平等的基础上解决剩下来的唯一的一个战俘问题。美国的这些挑衅行动是华盛顿扼杀停战谈判与扩大战争的阴谋的一部分。中朝人民识破这个阴谋，并紧密团结起来，予狂妄的美国侵略者以坚决的打击，直到它不得不放弃它的阴谋计划为止。
