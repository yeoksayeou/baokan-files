The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, in recent years, with a fighting spirit, have responded to Chairman Mao's great call to implement cultural education in the army, and have launched a wave of cultural learning. The term "illiterate" will basically become a thing of the past among the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army.

As early as 1950, the General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission compiled and issued a complete set of textbooks for the army's accelerated primary schools and junior middle schools, and has since distributed 20 million copies. All military and political schools have attached cultural preparatory courses, and specialized cultural accelerated schools have been gradually established, reaching hundreds to date. On the cultural education front, heroic warriors, like fighting a war, are exerting their amazing perseverance and creative wisdom. Many cultural warriors like Gao Yubao who study diligently and assiduously, typical examples of mutual learning such as the Li Guofu squad and the Li Shusen group, and vivid examples of overcoming difficulties in learning by using "moonlight lamps" and self-made motor instruments have emerged. In the movement of respecting teachers and loving students, commanders and fighters of worker-peasant origin and intellectual cadres are more closely united. The continuous creation of teaching methods is like "a hundred flowers blooming." Following Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method, Cao Weimin, Sun Keding and others have engaged in creative research on rapid arithmetic. Zeng Duanyi, Tang Bin, Zhou Bin and others created a new writing method. Like the new record movement on the motherland's production front, they are making the greatest efforts to improve teaching efficiency and shorten the time required for teaching.

The People's Liberation Army's promotion of rapid literacy methods is carried out in a prepared, planned, and steady manner. Each military region has universally opened experimental classes, gained experience, and then used demonstration teaching methods to universally train cultural teachers. After making substantial preparations, they began to fully implement rapid literacy teaching. In the process of carrying out rapid literacy teaching, each military region also frequently checked the effectiveness, summarized experience, and promptly overcame deviations such as "seeking speed without success" and relaxing the consolidation stage of rapid literacy, avoiding the emergence of a large number of "dropouts" and "half-baked" phenomena. The recent All-Army Cultural Education Symposium, based on the educational policy of being rapid, practical, and yet formal, concentrated existing experience and formulated the "Draft Teaching Plan for Rapid Literacy of Primary School Chinese and Arithmetic in the Armed Forces." Under the slogan of "Consolidate and Persist," all comrades in the army are actively striving for higher goals.

The work of eliminating illiteracy and improving culture in the People's Liberation Army currently focuses on popularizing primary school classes and gradually expanding middle school classes. The curriculum of each primary school class focuses on Chinese, followed by arithmetic, and then learning common knowledge of natural sciences, history, and geography. In terms of primary school Chinese education, on the basis of effectively completing rapid literacy, the policy of mastering key points and gradually improving is adopted; lectures, reading, and writing are combined; reading aloud, reading more, and writing more; fully utilizing students' experience and stimulating thinking methods; and focusing on basic training in characters, words, and sentences. According to existing experience, it only takes 650 teaching hours (including rapid literacy) to raise the Chinese proficiency of an illiterate person to the level of a senior primary school graduate. In terms of primary school arithmetic education, emphasis is placed on correctly applying the function of multiplication tables; combining adults' existing arithmetic knowledge, understanding ability, and mental arithmetic ability, systematically and thoroughly reorganizing existing teaching materials, appropriately arranging difficulties, and focusing on breakthroughs; combining lectures and exercises, and paying attention to using physical objects, diagrams, and models for teaching. By doing this, it only takes about 320 teaching hours to largely complete the arithmetic learning of senior primary school.

Under the leadership of the Party committees at the regimental level and above, all units have established cultural education committees and their offices, mobilizing a considerable number of cadres to form inspection teams to promptly grasp the development of the cultural learning movement. Communists and Youth League members in the companies played a pioneering role in learning culture and became a shock force in learning culture. Leading organs at all levels have made good material guarantees for cultural education, such as textbooks, classrooms, paper, and writing materials. Many cadres have voluntarily given up their residences and converted them into offices for cultural teachers. Various excellent popular reading materials are being compiled, printed, and purchased in large quantities. Various newspapers and periodicals are reporting and guiding cultural learning with great coverage. A film about Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method is being produced at an accelerated pace; various military regions have also created many songs, dramas, and dances to cooperate with the cultural learning movement.

Over the past three years, the army's cultural education has received enthusiastic help and guidance from many people in the national education circles, and the experience of the army's cultural education has assisted the literacy movement of workers and peasants in various places. Currently, dozens of worker-peasant accelerated schools are using the cultural textbooks compiled and printed by the General Political Department of the Military Commission. In the Southwest and other places, the troops have helped local areas open many experimental classes for rapid literacy methods; in East China and other places, they have sent army cultural teachers to participate in worker-peasant education work.

    解放军各部队展开大规模文化学习运动
    人民解放军各部队指挥员、战斗员，近年来以战斗的姿态，响应毛主席关于在军队中实施文化教育的伟大号召，掀起了文化学习热潮。“文盲”这个名词，在人民解放军指战员中就要基本上成为过去的了。
    早在一九五○年，中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部就编发了全套的部队速成小学与初级中学的课本，至今已发行两千万册。各军事、政治学校都附设文化预科，而专门的文化速成学校已逐步建立，至今已达数百所。在文化教育战线上，英雄的战士，像打仗一样地发挥着他们惊人的毅力与创造性的智慧，出现了不少高玉宝式的苦学苦练的文化战士和李国富班、李树森组等互助学习的典型，以及使用“月光灯”、自造电动机仪器等克服困难进行学习的生动范例。在尊师爱生运动中，工农出身的指战员和知识分子干部更亲密地结合起来。教学方法上的不断创造，正如“百花齐放”一般。继祁建华速成识字法之后，出现了曹卫民、孙克定等人从事关于速成算术的创造性的研究。曾端仪、唐斌、周斌等人创造了新写字法。像祖国生产战线上的新纪录运动一样，他们正以最大的努力来提高教学效率，缩短教学所需的时间。
    人民解放军各部队推行速成识字法，是有准备、有计划地稳步进行的。各军区普遍开办了实验班，取得经验后，又用观摩教学的方法，普遍训练了文化教员；大体准备妥当之后，才开始全面展开速成识字教学。各军区在进行速成识字教学中又经常检查效果，总结经验，及时克服“求速不求成”以及放松速成识字的巩固阶段等偏向，避免了大量“掉队”与“夹生饭”等现象的产生。最近的一次全军文化教育座谈会，又本着速成的、联系实际的、但又是正规的教育方针，集中了已有的经验，制订了
    “部队小学语文、算术速成教学方案”（草案）。全军同志在“巩固起来，坚持下去”的口号之下，更加积极地奔赴更高的目标。
    人民解放军扫除文盲提高文化的工作，目前仍着重普及小学班，逐渐扩大中学班。各小学班课程以语文为主，算术次之，随后再学习自然、历史、地理常识。小学语文教育方面，在速成识字切实完成的基础上，采用掌握重点逐步提高的方针；讲课、阅读、写作三者结合进行；熟读、多看、多写；充分利用学员经验，启发思考的方法；注重字、词、语句的基本训练。根据现有经验，从文盲提高到高级小学毕业的语文程度，只需六百五十个教学小时
    （包括速成识字在内）。小学算术教育方面，则强调正确地发挥口诀的作用；结合成人已有的算术知识、理解能力和心算能力，系统地周密地改组现有教材，恰当地排列难点，予以重点突破；讲练结合，注意运用实物、图解、模型进行教学。这样做，只要有三百二十小时左右的教学时间，就可以大体完成高级小学的算术学习。
    在团以上各级党委领导下，各部队都设立了文化教育委员会及其办公室，调集相当数量的干部，组成检查队，及时地掌握文化学习运动的发展。连队的共产党员与青年团员，在学习文化中起了先锋作用，成为学习文化的突击力量。各级领导机关为文化教育做好了有关课本、课堂、纸张、笔墨等物质保证。许多干部自动地让出了自己的住所，改为文化教员的办公室。各种优良的通俗读物正在大批地编印和选购中。各种报刊都以极大篇幅报道与指导着文化学习。有关祁建华速成识字法的影片，正在加紧制作；各军区并创作了许多歌曲、戏剧、舞蹈，配合文化学习运动。
    军队的文化教育，三年来曾得到全国教育界许多热心的帮助与指导，而军队文化教育的经验又协助了各地工农群众的识字运动。目前已有数十处工农速成学校采用着军委总政治部编印的文化教材。在西南等地，部队帮助地方开办了许多速成识字法实验班；华东等地，则派出了军队的文化教员参加工农教育工作。
