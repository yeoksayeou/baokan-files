    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives convened its second provisional joint meeting of directors and supervisors in Beijing on July 18th to discuss the "All-China Federation of Cooperatives 1951 Work Summary and 1952 Work Plan Highlights" and to re-elect the Standing Council, among other matters. Attendees included Cheng Zihua, Meng Yongqian, and Liang Yao, vice-chairmen of the Board of Directors; Xue Muqiao, Nan Hanchen, Yao Yilin, Wu Juenong, Zhang Qinqiu, Liu Ziju, Luo Qiong, Deng Jie, Yang Gangyi, Zhang Lisen, Yan Guhang, Chen Yifan, Guo Xianrui, Wang Chun, Chen Naijun, Wu Guangqing, and Deng Chenxi, directors; Ye Jizhuang, chairman of the Board of Supervisors; Yu Shude, vice-chairman; and Sun Xiaocun, Zhang Xinyi, and Luo Jun, supervisors, totaling twenty-five people.

    Vice-Chairman Cheng Zihua delivered a report at the meeting on the "All-China Federation of Cooperatives 1951 Work Summary and 1952 Work Plan Highlights," pointing out that due to the implementation of the correct policy of "upper-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives, and grassroots cooperatives serving members" by cooperatives in various regions, significant improvements and developments have been made in both the organization and business of cooperatives over the past year, and some basic experiences have been gained. First, the focus was placed on economic crop areas, which on the one hand, laid a solid foundation for the state to control industrial raw materials and export goods; on the other hand, because the rural economy in these areas is more commercialized and the purchasing power of farmers is higher, doing a good job in these areas makes it easier to drive the work in general crop areas. Second, there are two experiences in business organization: one is the establishment of a sales department to purchase agricultural crops and supply raw materials to factories and consumer goods to urban people, and the other is the establishment of a supply department to organize the sales of industrial products and provide production and living materials to the people. In this way, the supply and marketing business can be carried out actively, avoiding the phenomenon of neglecting one thing for another. Third, in the organizational construction of grassroots cooperatives, the establishment of cooperatives in market towns or districts has changed the past situation of "four fews and one many" (few members, little capital, few transactions, little income, and much expenditure) in villages, making it difficult to expand business, and due to the concentration of funds and the expansion of business, the economic status of cooperatives in rural areas has been improved; however, in some old liberated areas, because the past cooperatives were established in small mountain villages, the masses have long-standing habits and welcome this form, so there is no need to force changes. In sparsely populated areas, it is also necessary to adapt to local conditions and not adhere to the establishment of cooperatives in market towns or districts. The reorganization of urban consumer cooperatives into large cooperatives based on residential areas is as successful as the establishment of cooperatives in market towns or districts in rural areas. Fourth, cooperatives are no longer many isolated small shops, but a whole with unified planning. It is wrong to recognize cooperatives as ordinary small shops because they not only fulfill the general task of material exchange to improve the lives of the working people, but also serve agricultural production in a planned and organized manner in supply and marketing operations, promoting and helping to improve agricultural production, and carrying out "pre-purchases" from farmers, beginning to combine farmers' production plans with the state's production plans. The "combination contracts" signed by cooperatives in various regions with mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives are a good way to achieve this combination. These measures are conducive to guiding farmers to move towards the road of collectivization.

    Vice-Chairman Cheng Zihua continued: In the great "Three-Anti" movement, cooperative cadres systematically criticized the past profit-only view in the work of cooperatives, cleared out corruption and waste, and combated bureaucracy, thereby enhancing the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees, which brought a new atmosphere to the cooperatives and laid an ideological and mass foundation for improving work in the future.

    Regarding the key points of the cooperative's work in the second half of this year, Vice-Chairman Cheng Zihua proposed to strengthen the work of county and city cooperatives and the leadership of grassroots cooperatives, vigorously implement the democratic system of cooperatives, strengthen the planning and statistics work of cooperatives at all levels, promote the new accounting system, and implement four fixed rates, such as capital and commodity turnover rate, circulation cost rate, damage rate, and net profit rate, to improve business management and improve the work of cooperatives. In the second half of this year, a mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy will be launched to strive to complete the plan of increasing production and practicing economy by five trillion yuan in the national cooperative system in 1952.

    The meeting unanimously agreed to and approved Vice-Chairman Cheng Zihua's report. At the same time, it approved two decisions on reforming and reorganizing supply and marketing operations, as well as the "Resolution on Improving and Adjusting the Organizational Structure of Cooperatives at All Levels," "1951 Cooperative Profit and Loss Situation and Surplus Distribution Method," and "Planned Steps for Rapidly Establishing an Independent System of Industrial Production Cooperatives."

    Finally, the meeting approved the appointment and removal of directors and supervisors and re-elected the Standing Council. The new Standing Council members are Bo Yibo, Cheng Zihua, Zhang Qilong, Meng Yongqian, Liang Yao, Yao Yilin, Li Zheren, Chen Yifan, Zhang Lisen, Yang Gangyi, and Luo Jun, totaling eleven people.

    全国合作总社召开第二次临时理事、监事联席会议
    批准合作社去年工作总结和今年计划要点
    中华全国合作社联合总社于七月十八日在北京召开第二次临时理事、监事联席会议，讨论“全国合作社联合总社一九五一年工作总结和一九五二年工作计划要点”以及改选常务理事会等事项。出席的有理事会副主任程子华、孟用潜、梁耀，理事薛暮桥、南汉宸、姚依林、吴觉农、张琴秋、刘子久、罗琼、邓洁、杨刚毅、张立森、阎顾行、陈一帆、郭献瑞、王纯、陈乃君、武光清、邓辰西，监事主任叶季壮、副主任于树德，监事孙晓村、张心一、罗俊等共二十五人。
    程子华副主任在会上作了关于“全国合作社联合总社一九五一年工作总结和一九五二年工作计划要点”的报告，指出：由于各地合作社贯彻了“上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务”的正确方针，因而一年来各地合作社在组织上和业务上都有着显著改进和发展，同时并取得一些基本经验。首先是将工作重点放在经济作物区，这就一方面为国家掌握工业原料和出口物资奠定了可靠的基础；另方面，因为这些地区农村经济商品化程度较高，农民购买力也较高，把这些地区工作作好，就容易把一般农作物地区的工作带动起来。其次，在业务组织上的经验有两个：一个是成立推销部门收购农作物供应工厂原料及城市人民消费，一个是成立供应部门，组织工业品推销，供给人民生产和生活资料，这样，就使供销业务均能主动进行，避免了顾此失彼现象。第三，在基层社的组织建设上，实行集镇或区建社后，改变了过去村村有社“四少一多”（社员少、资金少、交易少、收益少，开支多），难以扩大业务的现象，并由于资金集中，业务扩大，提高了合作社在农村中的经济地位；但在有些老解放区，由于过去的合作社是从山沟小村建立起来的，群众已有长期习惯，并欢迎这种形式时，则不必强予变更。在地广人稀的地区，亦应因地制宜，不必拘泥于以集镇或区来建社。城市消费合作社，按居住区改建大社后，如同农村以集镇或区建社是一样成功的。第四，目前合作社已不是许多孤立的小店铺，而是有着统一计划的整体，如果把合作社作为普通的小店铺来认识是错误的。因为它不仅实现一般的物资交流任务来改善劳动人民的生活，而且在供销业务上有计划有组织地为农业生产服务，促进和帮助了农业生产的提高，并向农民进行“预购”，开始把农民的生产计划与国家的生产计划结合起来。各地合作社与互助组和农业生产合作社订立的“结合合同”，就是这种结合的一种良好办法。这些措施，均有利于引导农民向着合作化的道路前进。
    程子华副主任继指出：在伟大的“三反”运动中，合作社干部系统地批判了过去合作社工作中存在着的单纯营利观点，清除了贪污、浪费，打击了官僚主义，因而提高了广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，这就给合作社带来了新的气象，为今后改进工作打下了思想基础和群众基础。
    对合作社今年下半年工作要点，程子华副主任提出要加强县、市合作社工作和对基层社的领导，大力贯彻合作社的民主制度，加强各级合作社的计划统计工作，推行新的会计制度；试行资金和商品周转率、流通费用率、伤耗率、纯利率等四项定率，来改善业务管理，将合作社工作提高一步。并在今年下半年开展群众性的增产节约运动，为完成一九五二年在全国合作社系统中增产节约五万亿元的计划而奋斗。
    会议一致同意和批准了程子华副主任的报告。同时批准了关于改革和整理供应和推销业务的两个决定，以及“改进和调整各级合作社组织机构的决议”、“一九五一年合作社损益情况和盈余分配办法”、“为迅速建立工业生产合作社的独立系统的计划步骤”。
    最后，会议批准了理事、监事任免案和改选了常务理事会。新的常务理事为薄一波、程子华、张启龙、孟用潜、梁耀、姚依林、李哲人、陈一帆、张立森、杨刚毅、罗俊等十一人。
