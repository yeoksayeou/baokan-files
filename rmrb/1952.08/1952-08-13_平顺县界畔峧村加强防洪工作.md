    Jiebankao Village, Pingshun County, Strengthens Flood Control Work
    To the Editor: Last year, our village did not pay enough attention to flood control work. The floods washed away more than 500 field embankments (stone walls built alongside terraced fields are called field embankments) and damaged 16.5 mu of land. On July 25th of this year, the Chinese Communist Party branch of our village held a meeting to specifically study and discuss the People's Daily editorial published on July 20th, "Raise Vigilance and Strive to Overcome This Year's Floods." During the discussion, everyone felt that although most people did not pay attention to flood control work last year, some people did. Model worker Yang Fengshan led his mutual aid team (now changed to an agricultural production cooperative) to build five "flood control diversion channels," which protected the safety of more than 100 mu of land in the whole team. Everyone said: This year, we should carry forward the existing flood control experience of the masses and do a good job in flood control.
    After this discussion, everyone paid attention to flood control work. Model worker Yang Fengshan led 36 members of the agricultural production cooperative to repair five water channels, twelve "recumbent ox pits," and eighteen reservoirs in four days, and also built three new flood control channels. Under their impetus, the masses of the whole village built twenty-five new large flood control diversion channels, forty "recumbent ox pits" and reservoirs, and two water cellars in seven days, and also repaired nine wells and three large pools that had been dug in the spring for drought prevention. As a result, all 650 mu of autumn crops in the village were not affected by the recent heavy rains.

    平顺县界畔峧村加强防洪工作
    编辑同志：去年我村不重视防洪工作，被洪水冲塌了五百多个地堰（梯田旁边垒上一层石头叫地堰），冲坏了十六亩五分地。今年七月二十五日，我们村的中共支部开了会，专门学习和讨论了人民日报七月二十日登的“提高警惕，为战胜今年的洪水而奋斗”的社论。在讨论的时候，大家感到去年大多数人虽然没有重视防洪工作，但也有些人是注意了的。劳动模范杨峰山就曾领导他的互助组（现在已改为农业生产合作社）修了五道“防洪顺水渠”，保卫了全组一百多亩地的安全。大家都说：今年应当发扬群众已有的防洪经验，作好防洪工作。
    经过这次讨论，大家都注意防洪工作了。劳动模范杨峰山领导农业生产合作社的社员三十六人，四天里修理了五道水渠、十二个卧牛坑、十八个蓄水池，又新修了三道防洪渠。在他们的带动下，全村群众在七天里新修了二十五道大的防洪顺水渠，四十个卧牛坑和蓄水池，二个水窖，又修理了春季防旱时打好的九口井和三个大水池。这样，全村六百五十亩秋庄稼在最近下大雨时都没有受到洪水的侵袭。
