Xinhua News Agency, 7th. London "Daily Worker" reporter Alan Winnington reported from Panmunjom on the 6th: The US side has rejected the protest lodged by the Korean and Chinese side regarding the shelling of the conference area on August 2nd. They flatly denied that these shells could be proven to be theirs and said that there was no need for an investigation at all. However, due to the insistence of the Korean side, they reluctantly agreed to reconsider the evidence – there were many eyewitnesses to the incident. But more important than the shelling incident is the US side's attitude towards the investigation. From their attitude, it can be seen that they do not want to negotiate, nor do they want to fulfill the basic terms of the neutral zone agreement. This is similar to their attitude last year, when they used the means of the summer and autumn offensives, which ultimately suffered defeat, to delay negotiations and threaten the Korean and Chinese side. This series of events and the provocative attitude of the US side in refusing to take appropriate action should be viewed from this perspective.

    美方拒绝调查炮击会场区事件
    妄图制造挑衅拖延停战谈判
    【新华社七日讯】伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿六日自板门店报道：美方拒绝了朝中方面就八月二日炮击会场区事件所提出的抗议。他们干脆否认这些炮弹可以被证明是他们的，并且说根本用不着调查。但是由于朝鲜方面的坚持，他们勉强地同意重新考虑这些证据——事件的目击者很多。但是比炮击事件更重要的是美方对于调查的态度，从他们的态度可以看出他们不想谈判了，也不想履行中立区协定的基本条款了。这和他们去年的态度相似，去年八月他们是用结果遭受了失败的夏季与秋季攻势的手段来拖延谈判并威胁朝中方面的。对目前这一系列的事件和美方拒作适当处理的挑衅态度，应该从这一个角度来看。
