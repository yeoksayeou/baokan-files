    Chongqing Xinhua Daily Editorial Department Examines Reports on Out-of-District Abundant Harvest Experiences
    Comrades Editors: The People's Daily's "Newspaper Review" column on July 23, in its article "Correcting Two Deviations in the Propaganda of Promoting Advanced Agricultural Abundant Harvest Experiences," criticized the editor's note of our newspaper regarding the promotion of advanced agricultural production experiences from other regions. After seeing the report, a few comrades believed that our newspaper had previously conducted some publicity on the advanced experiences of abundant harvests in other regions (such as Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience) and had not adopted an attitude of refusing to introduce them. However, after our examination and discussion, we unanimously believe that the People's Daily's criticism of us is necessary and completely correct. When some readers asked our newspaper to introduce more abundant harvest experiences from other regions of the country, we neither actively took measures in practice to introduce them critically in conjunction with the actual conditions of our region, nor did the editor, in the editor's note, use the reason that the experiences of other regions may not be suitable for our region to express a refusal to satisfy readers' requests. This in effect refused the introduction of advanced experiences from other regions, which is obviously wrong. At the same time, our editorial department did not discover the above-mentioned errors for a long period of time, which also shows that we were not clear in our understanding of how to correctly promote the propaganda of advanced agricultural production experiences in the past.
    The criticism from the People's Daily has been of great help to us, enabling us to have a further understanding of how to promote advanced agricultural experiences in the future, as well as advanced experiences in industry and other fields.

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

    重庆新华日报编辑部检查关于对外区丰产经验的报道
    编辑同志：七月二十三日人民日报“报纸述评”栏登载的“纠正推广农业丰产经验宣传中的两种偏向”一文中，曾对本报关于推广外区农业生产先进经验的编者按语提出批评。我们见报后，有少数同志认为本报过去对外区农业丰产的先进经验（如对曲耀离的种棉经验），曾进行过一些宣传，并未采取拒不介绍的态度。但是，经过我们检查和讨论后，一致认为人民日报对我们的批评是必要的，也是完全正确的。当有些读者向本报提出多多介绍全国其他地区的丰产经验的要求时，我们既未在实际上积极采取办法，结合本区情况批判地进行介绍，而编者反在按语中以外区经验不一定适合本区为理由，表示拒绝满足读者要求，这在实际上就拒绝了外区先进经验的介绍，显然是不对的。同时，我们编辑部在一个很长的时期内，对上述错误始终没有发现，也就说明了我们过去对应如何正确地进行推广农业生产先进经验的宣传在认识上是不明确的。
    人民日报的批评对我们帮助很大，使我们对今后如何宣传农业的先进经验及对工业和其他方面的先进经验的问题，有了进一步的认识。
