    The Peace Movement in Indonesia
    Chen Lian
    Indonesia is a rich and beautiful country. It is "like a belt of emeralds, surrounding both sides of the equator." The vast Pacific and Indian Oceans embrace its more than two thousand islands, large and small. The glorious sun shines particularly brightly on its evergreen mountains, fields, villages, and cities. Everywhere there are green coconut groves and rubber plantations; rich deposits of oil and tin ore are buried underground. Here live more than 81 million people (according to the latest Java Bank annual report figures) who love peace, freedom, and art. They have endured more than 350 years of imperialist rule and plunder. Imperialism has not only drained their blood and sweat but also monopolized their rich resources. Their lives are extremely impoverished. But their struggle for freedom and peace, for survival and happiness, has never been interrupted.
    At present, due to the intensified pursuit of a war-preparatory policy by U.S. imperialism, the peaceful lives of the Indonesian people have been severely threatened. U.S. imperialism is attempting to include Indonesia in its "Pacific defense line." It has created the U.S.-Japan, U.S.-Philippines, and U.S.-Australia-New Zealand military agreements, forming an arc-shaped encirclement of Indonesia. The eastern territory of Indonesia—West Irian—is still occupied by the Netherlands. U.S., Dutch, and other imperialists are expanding their military aggression bases there. The former Sukiman cabinet, following the war-preparatory policy of U.S. imperialism, accepted the "Embargo Act," participated in the signing of the unilateral "Japanese Peace Treaty" in San Francisco, and also concluded the "Mutual Security Act Agreement." This has placed the Indonesian people in a position of being tied to the American war chariot. However, due to the strong opposition of the Indonesian people to Sukiman's path, the Sukiman cabinet finally fell.
    U.S. imperialism's war-preparatory policy has directly hit the Indonesian economy and the people's lives. Especially after the implementation of the "Embargo Act," rubber exports, which account for 50 percent of Indonesia's national income, have decreased by 30 percent (compared to the first and second halves of 1951). At the beginning of 1952, Indonesia had 300,000 tons of rubber that could not be exported (accounting for 43 percent of the annual output of 700,000 tons), and the drop in rubber prices has reduced the purchasing power of the broad masses of people who depend on rubber for their livelihoods (such as the rubber-producing area of Jambi) by 70 percent. Coupled with the dumping of Japanese goods, Indonesia's weak national industry has encountered a serious crisis. By the beginning of 1952, about 60 to 70 percent of the sarong factories in Java had closed down or reduced production; textile production decreased by 50 to 60 percent. Unemployment and famine are becoming increasingly serious. In the capital, Jakarta, there are more than 300,000 unemployed and semi-employed vagrants (out of a total population of over two million). In the Lesser Sunda Islands province with a population of four million, there are 420,000 famine victims, and in all of Java, there are over one million famine victims.
    Under such circumstances, the Indonesian people deeply feel the threat of war and hate the disasters brought to them by U.S. imperialism. For their own bright future, they have risen to support the peace movement.
    After the Stockholm Peace Appeal of 1950 reached Indonesia, the National Peace Committee of Indonesia and 19 local branches were established one after another. Soon, 550,000 people signed the Peace Appeal. They also held peace rallies and organized a "Peace Train" during the "May Day" celebrations last year. At the "May Day" peace rallies in various places, more than a million people held high the banner of peace and unanimously raised their hands to approve the World Peace Council's resolutions to defend peace. Subsequently, Indonesia launched a signature campaign demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, and the number of respondents was even greater, with 650,000 signatures. Many activists emerged in the signature campaign. For example, Mustofa, a youth from the Indonesian Plantation Workers Union, collected 10,000 signatures by himself. The workers not only signed themselves but also took the declaration to seek signatures from others. Farmers and farm workers near Siantar, Sumatra, said while signing: "Why shouldn't we want peace? During the more than three years of Japanese occupation, we were robbed of everything. We were left only to starve, eat wild grass, and wear ragged burlap pants. And now the American 'embargo' is driving us towards unemployment, hunger, and death..." They requested the signature teams to go deep into the villages and farms to publicize the truth about peace. Indonesian Muslims said: "Our religious name is Islam, which means peace and truth! We want truth, and we also want peace." In May and June of this year, Indonesia launched a signature campaign in various places to oppose U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare. In the Tinggir City area of central Sumatra alone, 11,000 people signed in mid-June. Nirawati, a member of the Awakened Women's Association in that area, collected 800 signatures by herself. The Indonesian peace movement has not only received the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of workers and peasants but also the approval of people from all walks of life in society. National capitalists, Luchito, chairman of the Indonesian Central Economic Council, Budiningrat, professor at Gadjah Mada University, Makono, president of the State Bank, and parliamentarians from various parties in the National Assembly, such as Sunarjo, Sidik, Gusnan, Basri, Suyono, and Dayudin Noor, and many other well-known figures in society have also participated in the peace signature campaign. Sunarjo once said: "As long as it is a matter that is beneficial to peace, I approve of it regardless of where it comes from." In the National Assembly, the vast majority of parties oppose the "Japanese Peace Treaty" and the "Mutual Security Act Agreement." The Indonesian people know that defending peace is the common cause of people all over the world.
    With the vigorous development of the peace movement of people in all countries of the world, the peace movement of the Indonesian people has also united with the international peace movement. In previous international peace conferences, the Indonesian people overcame various difficulties, sent their own representatives to attend, and supported the world peace movement. At the same time, the representatives also brought back the friendship of the people of all countries, giving the Indonesian people infinite encouragement. Especially after the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in early June this year, the Indonesian peace movement entered a new stage.
    The National Peace Committee of Indonesia has sent Pastor Utosia to Beijing to participate in the preparatory work, and the Indonesian Preparatory Meeting has been established domestically. It is planned to widely publicize the significance of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and launch discussions on peace issues in the Asian and Pacific region between July and September. In order to welcome the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, Indonesia is actively selecting representatives and plans to hold a "Peace Week" at the end of September. At that time, exhibitions, receptions, mass rallies, etc. will be held in various places. The peace-loving people of Indonesia will, together with the peace-loving people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific region, set off a high tide of the peace movement.
    We believe that "peace can be saved, and peace must be saved." The people of Asia and the Pacific region have the power to make the turbulent waves on the vast Pacific and Indian Oceans become songs of peace, songs of joy, and songs of happiness.

    保卫和平运动在印尼
    陈莲
    印度尼西亚是个富饶而美丽的国家。它“好像一条翡翠之带，围绕在赤道的两旁”。苍苍茫茫的太平洋和印度洋，拥抱着它那大小二千多个岛屿。辉煌的太阳特别鲜艳地照耀着它那终年常绿的山林、原野、乡村和城市。到处是苍绿的椰子林和树胶园；地下埋藏着丰富的石油和锡矿。在这里，生活着八千一百余万（根据最近爪哇银行年报数字）爱好和平、自由与艺术的人民。他们经受了三百五十余年帝国主义的统治和掠夺。帝国主义不但吸尽了他们的血汗，而且还垄断着他们富饶的资源。他们的生活是极端贫困的。但他们争取自由与和平，争取生存与幸福的斗争从来没有间断过。
    目前，由于美帝国主义备战政策的加紧推行，印尼人民的和平生活已受到严重的威胁。美帝国主义企图把印尼划入它的“太平洋防线”之中。它制造了美、日，美、菲，美、澳、纽三个军事协定，构成对印尼的弧形包围圈。印尼东部的领土——西伊里安——仍然为荷兰所占领。美、荷等帝国主义正在那里扩大着军事侵略基地。前苏基曼内阁追随着美帝国主义备战政策，接受了“禁运案”，参加了旧金山片面的“对日和约”的签订，并又订立了“共同安全法协定”。这使印尼人民面临着被缚在美国战车上的运命。但由于印尼人民强烈反对苏基曼的道路，苏基曼内阁终于倒台了。
    美帝国主义的备战政策已直接打击了印尼的经济和人民的生活，尤其在“禁运案”实行后，占印尼国民收入百分之五十的树胶输出已减少了百分之三十（一九五一年上半年与下半年比较）。一九五二年初印尼已存下三十万吨树胶无法输出（占年产七十万吨百分之四十三），而树胶跌价使依赖树胶为生的广大人民的购买力（如占卑产树胶区）已降低了百分之七十。再加上日货的倾销，印尼微弱的民族工业遭遇了严重的危机。爪哇的花裙工厂，到一九五二年初为止，约有百分之六、七十倒闭或减产；纺织业生产减少百分之五、六十。失业、饥馑日趋严重。首都雅加达就有三十万以上无业和半失业的游民
    （该市人口共二百余万）。小巽达省人口四百万，便有四十二万饥民，全爪哇饥民已达百余万人。
    在这样的情况下，印尼人民深感到战争的威胁，痛恨美帝国主义带给他们的灾难。他们为了自己美好的将来，起来拥护和平运动了。
    一九五○年斯德哥尔摩和平宣言传到印尼后，印尼全国和平委员会及各地十九个分会先后成立了。不久就有五十五万人在和平宣言上签名。他们又在去年“五一”节举行了和平集会，举办了“和平列车”。在各地“五一”节和平集会上，百余万群众都高举着和平的旗帜，并一致举手赞成世界和平理事会保卫和平的各项决议。嗣后印尼又展开了要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动，响应的人数更多，签名的有六十五万人。在签名运动中涌现了许多积极分子。例如印尼农园工会的青年慕斯托发，他一个人便征集了一万个人签名。工人们不但自己签了名，还带了宣言去征求别人签名。苏门答腊先达市附近的农民和农场工人在签名时说：“我们怎么不要和平呢。日本三年多的占领，把我们什么都抢光了。我们只落得挨饿，吃野草，穿一条破麻袋裤，而现在美国的‘禁运’，又把我们赶向失业、饥饿和死亡……”他们要求签名队深入乡村和农场，宣传和平的道理。印尼的回教徒说：“我们的教名伊斯兰，其含义就是和平与真理！我们要真理，我们也要和平。”今年五、六月间，印尼各地为反对美帝国主义的细菌战，曾发动签名运动。仅在苏门答腊中部丁宜市区，六月中便有一万一千人签名。该地觉醒妇女会会员尼拉瓦蒂一个人便征集了八百个人签名。印尼的和平运动不仅得到广大工农群众的热烈支持，社会上各阶层的人士也同样赞成。民族资本家、印尼中央经济理事会的主席鲁其多，卡渣马达大学教授布第宁格拉，国家银行总裁马哥诺，国会中各党派的议员苏纳约、西狄克、古斯南、巴斯利、苏约诺、打友丁·诺尔等不少社会著名人士也都参加了和平签名。苏纳约曾说过这样的话：
    “只要有利于和平的事情，不论来自那方面我都赞成。”在国会里绝大多数的党派都反对“对日和约”，反对“共同安全法协定”。印尼人民知道：保卫和平是全世界人民的共同事业。
    随着世界各国人民和平运动的蓬勃开展，印尼人民的和平运动也与国际上和平运动联合起来了。历届国际性的和平会议中，印尼人民都克服各种困难，派遣自己的代表出席，支持了世界和平运动。同时，代表们也带回世界各国人民的友谊，给印尼人民以无限的鼓舞。尤其在今年六月初亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议之后，印尼和平运动走上了新的阶段。
    印尼全国和平委员会已派乌托西亚牧师来北京参加筹备工作，在国内则成立了印尼筹备会议。拟定在七月至九月间，广泛地宣传亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的意义，展开对亚洲及太平洋区域和平问题的讨论。为了迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，印尼已在积极推选代表，并拟于九月末举行“和平周”。届时各地将分别举行展览会、招待会、群众大会……。印尼爱好和平的人民将和全亚洲及太平洋区域各国的和平人民一道，掀起一个和平运动的高潮。
    我们相信，“和平可以拯救，和平必须拯救”。亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，是有力量使那苍苍茫茫的太平洋和印度洋上的汹涌的波涛，成为和平的歌唱，快乐的歌唱，幸福的歌唱的。
