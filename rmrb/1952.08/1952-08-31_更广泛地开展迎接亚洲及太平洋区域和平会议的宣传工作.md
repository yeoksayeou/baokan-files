    More Broadly Carry Out Propaganda Work to Welcome the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will soon be held in Beijing. This is a major event in the movement to defend peace in the Asian and Pacific regions and to defend world peace. The Asian and Pacific regions include more than thirty countries with a population of 1.6 billion (two-thirds of the world's total population). In June of this year, representatives from twenty-six countries came to Beijing to participate in the preparatory work for this conference. After the representatives returned to their countries, they launched large-scale publicity and preparatory work for the conference. The vast number of peace-loving people in various countries have unanimously expressed their warm support for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and actively elected representatives to attend the conference. Currently, people in various parts of Japan have held many grand gatherings and elected more than 400 representative candidates. India held a nationwide "Asia Week", calling on people from all over the country to enthusiastically participate in the peace movement, and achieved significant results. Our people are the initiators of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. From the beginning, the broad masses of our people have warmly supported the convening of this conference. Now, as the conference is about to open victoriously, we should further expand the propaganda and discussion of this conference, so that everyone in the country knows the important significance and role of this conference, and all support this conference with practical actions, so that the conference can achieve greater results and more effectively safeguard peace and security in the Asian and Pacific regions.

    Tell Everyone the Significance of Convening This Conference
    The people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions want peace and oppose war. They are looking forward to a peaceful life, willing to have friendly exchanges with each other, and oppose foreign aggression. However, imperialist aggressors have repeatedly dragged the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions into the disaster of war. Due to the aggression of Japanese imperialism, the Asian and Pacific regions suffered the deaths and injuries of tens of millions of people and the loss of countless properties during World War II. The people of all countries have suffered all kinds of pain from the war. After the Soviet army joined the Asian battlefield and cooperated with the people of various countries to defeat Japanese imperialism, peace in Asia and the Pacific was restored. After Japan surrendered, the people of all countries were working hard to heal the wounds of war and build their own peaceful lives. The Soviet people built a great communist construction project like the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, making "five seas navigable", and are striving to turn the deserts of Central Asia and Siberia into fertile fields, and are now implementing the large-scale Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. After overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Chinese people, although in an environment of being invaded by US imperialism, still strived for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation, restored production, and started construction in various aspects. We carried out huge water conservancy projects such as harnessing the Huai River, built the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway that we had been looking forward to for decades, and are about to start large-scale economic construction. The people of other countries are also working hard to build a better life. However, US imperialism is reviving Japanese militarism and plotting to launch another world war. It is expanding its aggressive forces everywhere, establishing military aggression bases throughout the Asian and Pacific regions, and frantically carrying out war propaganda and expanding its armaments and preparing for war. It forcibly occupied our country's Taiwan and launched a war of aggression against Korea. The Korean armistice negotiations have not reached a final agreement for more than a year due to the procrastination and sabotage of the US aggressors. In the war of aggression against Korea, the United States also used the most cruel bacteriological weapons, and recently systematically and indiscriminately bombed 78 peaceful cities and countless peaceful villages in North Korea, clamoring to expand this barbaric war of aggression. In Vietnam, US aggressors are also supporting French colonialists in cruelly massacring the Vietnamese people who are demanding national independence. US aggressors are stepping up their efforts to manage Japan as a base for aggression in the Far East. The US-Japanese reactionaries have signed a unilateral peace treaty with Japan and a series of other war treaties. The United States has established more than 600 military bases in Japan. It is not only restoring the Japanese army, but also starting to restore the Japanese navy and air force. The US aggressors, on the one hand, are asking the reactionary Japanese government to pass many reactionary fascist laws to suppress the Japanese people's struggle for peace, democracy, and independence; on the other hand, they are releasing and employing a large number of Japanese war criminals and militarists, and actively antagonizing the people of Asian and Pacific countries.

    In the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia, US aggressors have forced the governments of many countries to sign a number of aggressive agreements, forcing them to expand their armaments and prepare for war. At the same time, US aggressors use methods such as blockades and embargoes to control the economic lifeline of many countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, and prevent cultural exchanges between the people of various countries, lowering the living standards of the people of many countries and hindering mutual understanding and friendly exchanges between the people of various countries.

    These measures of the US aggressors to launch and prepare for war directly violate the interests of the people of all countries and seriously threaten peace and security in the Asian and Pacific regions.

    However, the people of all countries have the power to stop the US imperialist war of aggression. This is because: on the one hand, the imperialist war group has many insurmountable weaknesses. There are contradictions everywhere within the imperialist camp. For example, the United States and Britain both wanted to organize a Pacific aggressive group with themselves as the head, but neither succeeded. On the other hand, the strength of the peace camp is unprecedentedly strong. The Soviet Union, which had defeated German and Japanese fascism, has unprecedentedly increased its national strength; the powerful new China has stood up; China and the Soviet Union have formed an invincible anti-aggression alliance; and the movement of the people of the world to defend peace is also growing stronger. Taking the countries of the Asian and Pacific regions as an example, in the Stockholm Peace Declaration signature campaign in 1950, 356 million people in 24 countries (including the Soviet Union) in the Asian and Pacific regions signed. Last year, in the signature campaign launched by the World Peace Council calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, the number of people who signed in 19 countries (including the Soviet Union) in the Asian and Pacific regions reached more than 488 million. Under such circumstances, in order to safeguard peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, on the one hand, the people of all countries in the peace camp must work hard to enhance their national defense and economic strength and resolutely resist US imperialist aggression. On the other hand, it is necessary to further unite all peace-loving people in various countries to jointly oppose aggression and stop war. The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is to better unite the forces of the people of all countries in the struggle for peace and to mobilize more people to participate in the movement to defend peace. The representatives attending the meeting from various countries will seek through consultation an effective way to consolidate peace and security in the Asian and Pacific regions, as a program of action for the people of all countries to defend the struggle for peace, and everyone will work together to repel the current threat of war.

    It Must Be Explained That Only by Uniting the Forces of Peace Can War Be Stopped
    Some people ask: "Since the warmongers want to launch a war, and they control the governments of the United States and many other countries, how can we, the peace-loving people who are unarmed, stop them from launching a war of aggression?" Regarding this question, Stalin said long ago: "If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the warmongers can succeed in deceiving the masses of the people with a web of lies, deceiving the masses of the people and dragging the masses of the people into another world war, then war may become inevitable."

    The truth is here. The number of warmongers is very small. They are just a small number of monopoly capitalists and big landlords of US imperialism and its vassal states and a group of their lackeys. These people want to make a fortune in war preparations and wars, but they cannot fight by themselves, because even if they all stand up in a team, they cannot form a few companies. But they control the governments and propaganda machines (newspapers, radio stations, movies, publishing institutions, education departments, etc.) of many countries, disseminate a large amount of war propaganda, and create international tensions. They create many absurd theories, for example, they say that "war is inevitable," as if the people of all countries cannot live without fighting. They fabricate all kinds of lies, for example, they say that the Soviet Union and China are preparing to launch a world war; they describe the war of aggression they launched in Korea as a "police action" to "maintain freedom and justice." In various capitalist countries, this kind of propaganda fills every day. Although this propaganda cannot deceive the broad masses of the people of various countries, it has a great deceptive effect on those who do not know the truth. If the peace advocates of various countries effectively expose this deception, they can further isolate the warmongers, and no one will follow them, and it will be more difficult for them to expand the war of aggression.

    In various countries, there are also many people who do not care or do not care much about the international situation. Some people do not know that the current threat of war is so serious; some people feel that war or peace does not seem to have much to do with them; and some people take a pessimistic attitude and feel that there is no way to stop the warmongers' conspiracy. These kinds of people are easily dragged into the disaster of war by the warmongers. Therefore, we should awaken those people, so that they know the threat of war, and know that everyone will suffer disaster if war breaks out; and know that as long as everyone unites and works hard, they can stop the evil conspiracy of the warmongers.

    The achievements of the people of various countries in the struggle to defend peace in recent years have been manifested in various aspects. The Chinese and Korean people's heroic war of resistance against US imperialist aggression has disrupted the aggressive steps of US imperialism and forced it to sit down and conduct armistice negotiations. The Japanese people's struggle for peace, democracy, and independence has encountered many difficulties in the progress of Japan's remilitarization. The four million people's parade and demonstration in Japan during this year's "May Day" made the US-Japanese reactionaries panic. Recently, the US-Japanese reactionaries' plan to expand armaments has also been hit by the Japanese people. They planned to recruit 4,500 new recruits in Niigata Prefecture, but only 20 people applied. The movement of the people of other countries to defend peace has also played a role in various aspects. For example, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, US aggressors forced the governments of one or twenty Latin American countries to provide cannon fodder, and many governments also agreed; but under the strong opposition of the people of various Latin American countries, the US plan failed, and except for the Colombian government sending a thousand soldiers to Korea, no other country sent a single soldier. Therefore, if the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions further strengthen unity and resolutely struggle, it will make it more and more difficult for the US imperialist war plan to be realized, and it will be able to safeguard peace in the Asian and Pacific regions.

    On the eve of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, we, the Chinese people, warmly welcome representatives from all countries to come to Beijing to participate in the conference. Everyone, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, nationalities, and occupations, under the general goal of safeguarding peace and security in the Asian and Pacific regions, makes more and better efforts to benefit the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions and benefit all mankind.

### 更广泛地开展迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的宣传工作

专栏：宣传员讲话

    更广泛地开展迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的宣传工作
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议不久就要在北京举行了。这是保卫亚洲及太平洋区域和平、保卫全世界和平的运动中的一件大事。亚洲及太平洋区域包括三十多个国家，人口有十六亿（占全世界总人口的三分之二）。今年六月，有二十六个国家的代表先后到北京参加了这个会议的筹备工作。各国代表回国后，在国内大规模地展开关于这个会议的宣传工作和筹备工作。各国广大爱好和平的人民，对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议一致表示热烈拥护，并积极选举出席会议的代表。现在日本各地人民举行了许多盛大的集会，选出了四百多代表候选人。印度举行了全国规模的“亚洲周”，号召各地人民热烈参加和平运动，获得了重大成绩。我国人民是亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的发起者。我国广大人民一开始就是热烈拥护这个会议的召开的。现在，当会议不久就要胜利开幕的时候，我们应该更进一步展开对于这个会议的宣传和讨论，让全国所有的人都知道这次会议的重要意义和作用，都用实际行动来支持这个会议，使会议能收到更大的效果，更有效地保卫亚洲、太平洋区域的和平与安全。
    要把召开这个大会的意义告诉大家
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民都是要求和平反对战争的。他们都盼着过和平生活，愿意互相友好来往，反对外国侵略。可是，帝国主义侵略者却屡次把亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民拖到战争的灾难里去。由于日本帝国主义的侵略，亚洲及太平洋区域各国在第二次世界大战中死伤了成千成万的人，损失了无数财产。各国人民受尽了战争的种种痛苦。苏联军队参加亚洲战场后，配合各国人民打败了日本帝国主义，恢复了亚洲、太平洋的和平。日本投降以后，各国人民正在努力平复战争创伤，建立自己的和平生活。苏联人民兴建了像列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河从而使“五海通航”的伟大共产主义建设工程，在努力使中亚细亚和西伯利亚的沙漠变成良田，现在又实行着大规模发展国民经济的第五个五年计划。中国人民在推翻了国民党的反动统治之后，虽然处在遭受美帝国主义侵略的环境之下，仍然争取了国家财政经济情况的根本好转，恢复了生产，开始了各方面的建设。我们进行了根治淮河那样巨大的水利工程，把盼望了几十年的成渝铁道修成了，并即将开始大规模的经济建设。其他各国人民也同样在努力争取建设美好的生活。可是美帝国主义却正在复活日本军国主义，阴谋发动另一次世界大战。它到处扩张它的侵略势力，在亚洲及太平洋区域各地普遍建立军事侵略基地，并疯狂地进行战争宣传和扩军备战。它强占了我国的台湾，发动了对朝鲜的侵略战争。朝鲜停战谈判，也因美国侵略者的拖延和破坏，以致一年多还没有达成最后协议。在侵略朝鲜战争中，美国又使用了最残酷的细菌武器，最近并在有计划地狂轰滥炸北朝鲜的七十八个和平城市和无数和平乡村，嚷叫着要扩大这种野蛮的侵略战争。在越南，美国侵略者也在支持法国殖民者残酷地屠杀要求民族独立的越南人民。美国侵略者正在加紧把日本经营成为一个在远东进行侵略的基地。美日反动派订立了片面的对日和约和一连串的其他战争条约。美国在日本建立六百多处军事基地。它不独正在恢复日本的陆军，而且在开始恢复日本的海军和空军。美国侵略者一面叫日本反动政府通过许多反动的法西斯法律来镇压日本人民要求和平、民主、独立的斗争；一面又大批释放和起用日本的战争罪犯和军国主义分子，积极与亚洲、太平洋各国人民为敌。
    在美洲、澳洲和东南亚各地，美国侵略者强迫许多国家的政府订立了好些侵略性的协定，迫使它们扩军备战。同时，美国侵略者用封锁、禁运等办法，控制亚洲及太平洋区域许多国家的经济命脉，并阻止各国人民的文化交流，使许多国家人民的生活水平降低，而且阻碍了各国人民间的相互了解和友好往来。
    美国侵略者这些发动战争和准备战争的措施，都是直接违反各国人民的利益，严重地威胁亚洲及太平洋区域的和平与安全的。
    但是，各国人民有力量制止美帝国主义的侵略战争。这是因为：一方面，帝国主义战争集团有许多不可克服的弱点。帝国主义阵营内部到处是矛盾。例如，美、英两国都想以自己为首组织一个太平洋侵略集团，但都没有搞成。另一方面，是和平阵营力量的空前强大。曾经击溃德、日法西斯的苏联，国力空前增涨；强大的新中国站起来了；中苏两国又结成了不可战胜的反侵略同盟；而且，全世界人民保卫和平的运动也越来越壮大了。拿亚洲及太平洋区域各国来说，在一九五○年的斯德哥尔摩和平宣言签名运动中，亚洲、太平洋区域二十四个国家（包括苏联）有三亿五千六百余万人签名。去年世界和平理事会发起的要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动，亚洲、太平洋区域十九个国家（包括苏联）中签名的人数达四亿八千八百万以上。在这样的形势之下，要保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，一方面是和平阵营各国人民要努力增强自己的国防力量和经济力量，坚决抵抗美帝国主义的侵略。另一方面，是要进一步团结各国的所有爱好和平的人民，共同来反对侵略，制止战争。这次召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，就是为了把各国人民争取和平的力量更好地团结起来，并发动更多的人来参加保卫和平的运动。各国到会的代表将通过协商求得一个巩固亚洲及太平洋区域和平与安全的有效办法，作为各国人民保卫和平斗争的行动纲领，大家一致努力，打退当前的战争威胁。
    要说明必须团结和平力量才能制止战争
    有人问：“既然战争贩子们想发动战争，而他们又控制了美国和其他许多国家的政府，我们这些手无寸铁的和平人民，怎么能制止他们发动侵略战争呢？”关于这个问题，斯大林早就说过：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那么战争就可能变得不可避免。”
    道理就在这里。战争贩子的人数是很少的。他们只是美帝国主义和它的各附庸国的一小撮垄断资本家、大地主和他们的一批走狗。这些人想在备战和战争中大发横财，可是他们自己是打不了仗的，因为他们全体站起队来也编不成几个连。但他们控制了许多国家的政府和宣传机器（报纸、广播电台、电影、出版机构、教育部门等等），大量散播战争宣传，并且制造国际间的紧张局势。他们制造许多荒谬的理论，比如，他们说，“战争是不可避免的”，好像各国人民不打仗就过不了日子。他们捏造种种谎话，比如，他们说苏联和中国在准备发动世界大战；他们把他们在朝鲜发动的侵略战争说成是“维护自由、正义”的“警察行动”。在各个资本主义国家里，每天充满了这种宣传。这种宣传虽然不能欺骗各国广大人民，但对那些不明真相的人却有很大的欺骗作用。各国的和平人士如果有效地揭穿他们这种欺骗，就能够使战争贩子更加陷于孤立，更没有人跟它走，它要想扩大侵略战争，困难就更大了。
    在各个国家里，还有许多人是不关心或不大关心国际形势的。有的人还不知道目前的战争威胁是这样严重；有的人则觉得战争也好，和平也好，似乎对他的关系不大；有的人则抱悲观态度，觉得没有办法制止战争贩子的阴谋。这样几种人都是很容易被战争贩子拖进战争灾难中去的。所以，我们应该唤醒那些人，使他们知道战争的威胁，知道如果发生战争每一个人都会遭受灾难；而且知道只要大家团结努力，就能够制止战争贩子的罪恶阴谋。
    几年来各国人民保卫和平斗争的成绩，已经从各方面表现出来。中国人民和朝鲜人民英勇地抗击美帝国主义的侵略的战争，已经打乱了美帝国主义的侵略步骤，迫使它不得不坐下来进行停战谈判。日本人民争取和平、民主、独立的斗争，使日本重新军国主义化的进行遭遇了许多困难。今年“五一”节日本四百万人的游行示威，使美日反动派慌了手脚。最近美日反动派的扩军计划也遭受了日本人民的打击。他们计划在新潟县招募四千五百名新兵，结果应征的只有二十人。其他各国人民保卫和平的运动，也在各方面起了作用。例如，朝鲜战争发生后不久，美国侵略者曾经强迫拉丁美洲一、二十个国家的政府出炮灰，有许多政府也答应了；可是在拉丁美洲各国人民强烈的反对下，结果美国的计划落了空，除了哥伦比亚政府派了一千个兵到朝鲜之外，其他各国一个兵也没有。所以亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民如果进一步加强团结，坚决斗争，就能使美帝国主义战争计划的实现愈来愈困难，就能保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平。
    在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议举行的前夕，我们中国人民热烈欢迎各国代表来北京参加会议，大家不分政治见解、宗教信仰、民族和职业的不同，在保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平与安全这个总的目标之下，做出更多的更好的工作，造福于亚洲、太平洋区域的十六亿人民，造福全人类。
