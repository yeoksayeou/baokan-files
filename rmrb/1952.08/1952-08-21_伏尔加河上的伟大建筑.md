Great Construction on the Volga River
    Shaboshnikov, Chief Engineer of the Construction Project of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station in the Soviet Union.
    Editor's Note: August 21st of this year marks the second anniversary of the decision by the Soviet Council of Ministers to build a large hydroelectric power station near Kuibyshev. We are publishing this article by Comrade Shaboshnikov, Chief Engineer of the Construction Project of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, to introduce the progress of the project.
    It has been two years since the Soviet government issued the decision to build a large hydroelectric power station near Kuibyshev on the Volga River. The entire construction project of the hydroelectric power station will take five years to complete. One figure can provide a concept of the project that should be completed in such a short time: the volume of earthwork reaches 150 million cubic meters. If these soils are loaded in train carriages connected one after another, their length can circle the equator four times.
    The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station is the largest hydroelectric power station in the world. Its power generation capacity is about two million kilowatts. In years with normal water levels, the hydroelectric power station will generate about 10 billion kilowatt-hours of cheap electricity. This electricity will supply industrial enterprises in Moscow, Kuibyshev, and Saratov. A considerable portion of the electricity will be used to irrigate one million hectares of arid land on the Volga River's plains. Extremely valuable crops – wheat – will grow here.
    The Soviet people call this construction, as well as the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, the Turkmen Main Canal, and the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station, Communist constructions and Stalin constructions, because these construction projects were carried out under the suggestion of Stalin, the leader of the Soviet people. The realization of these construction projects will guarantee a new upsurge and prosperity of the national economy and culture.
    In the past two years, significant changes have taken place on the banks of the Volga River near Kuibyshev. This is a summary of 1951: Last year, the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station completed more than 8 million cubic meters of earthwork and completed more than 70,000 square meters of residential area. On both the left and right banks of the river, railways leading to the foundation pits of the future dam were built, and more than 200 kilometers of high-voltage power lines were erected.
    The construction plan for 1952 is more than three times that of last year. The earthwork alone reaches 28 million cubic meters. It must be pointed out that the hydraulic mechanization part accounts for 18 million cubic meters. The construction project is now starting a new stage – pouring concrete for the main project of the hydroelectric power station, namely the foundation of the hydroelectric power station project and the buildings of the locks below the navigation canal. The first batch of automatic concrete factories equipped with crushers can guarantee the output of 6,000 cubic meters of concrete in one day and night.
    The entire construction project's duration and scale are precisely carried out according to the approved plan and the prescribed work schedule. Thus, the construction and assembly project plan for 1951 has been completed ahead of schedule. Similarly, we also completed the plan for the first half of 1952 ahead of schedule. This has made it possible for us to greatly increase the speed, expand the construction site, and scale in the construction process.
    In order to start the concrete project of the main buildings of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station at the end of the second year, the hydraulic machinery personnel, excavator operators, and technicians of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station project have completed truly huge projects. The workers who built the first dam on the Volga River around the foundation pit of the hydroelectric power station raised the riverbed by 400 meters. On the left bank of the river, a dam made of steel piles and gravel appeared, firmly defending the foundation pit of the hydroelectric power station.
    In the foundation pit behind this dam, hundreds of machines are working – electric excavators, dredgers, giant trucks, dump trucks, and bulldozers. The Soviets accurately master this technology and create miracles with their own hands. The names of the famous excavator operators – work team leaders Vasily Laminna, Mikhail Yevits, Boris Kovalyenko, and others – are spread inside and outside the construction site.
    Here, I would like to especially mention the youth excavator operator work team led by Boris Kovalyenko. Their powerful excavating machines pioneered a record of excavating 100,000 cubic meters of soil in a month on the construction site. This achievement was made possible to a large extent by improving the structure of the excavator's bucket. After Boris Kovalyenko took on the job of excavator operator on the construction site, he worked with machine construction workers from the Urals to study the structure of the excavator. He paid close attention to the fact that excavating the coal seam with the excavator's bucket was more effective than working on wet clay. Kovalyenko came up with the idea of ​​manufacturing a bucket with a new structure. Everyone supported him. His proposal was accepted, and the bucket was modified, and the excavator's excavation rate was significantly improved.
    Our construction site is a real university. People work and study here. We have teaching factories that train highly skilled experts, hydraulic technical schools that train highly skilled experts, and night industrial technical schools. The people of free labor, the masters of the country who deeply care about the common cause, manage this building and its most perfect Soviet technology, opening up unlimited possibilities for creative labor.
    By the end of this year, tens of thousands of cubic meters of concrete will be piled up in the depression of the hydroelectric power station.
    Another concrete project will be carried out this year – the locks below the navigation canal. It is located on the left bank of the river. The main project of the foundation pit lock construction is completed by electric dredgers. Today, their work has reached the level of building the future lock. The dam blocking the water of the Volga River protects the two foundation pits and the buildings of the hydroelectric power station and the lock. For example, on the left bank of the river, the dam stretches for about five kilometers. The spring flood of the Volga River is a severe test for the construction workers of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station. But these two dams – important buildings of hydraulic engineering – will certainly withstand this test.
    This spring, the construction workers of the hydroelectric power station began to build the third dam, which is built around the foundation pit of the spillway dam, and its scale exceeds the previous two. The dam extends for about eight kilometers. By the end of this year, hydraulic mechanization personnel alone will冲积 (I can not translate this as I do not know the actual intent of this word in this context.) 6 million cubic meters of soil for this dam. A lot of soil on the dam is piled up by the joint work team of excavator operators and automatic loading and unloading truck drivers.
    The huge scale of the project and the very short timeframe require us to mechanize to the maximum extent and to plan the entire production process with absolute precision. Last year, the railway trunk line was built, and this year, on all the land of the construction site, a new railway branch network directly reaching the construction site will be laid. All goods will be sent directly from the supply factory to there, and will be used or built immediately. We have a transfer station here.
    This year, the entire construction project of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station is huge, but in 1953, it will develop to a scale larger than that of 1952. Various preparations have long been carried out on our construction site to successfully complete this leap. The production and technology base has been greatly expanded. Two mechanical repair factories and two automatic repair factories, four repair shops and four motor vehicle yards, two woodworking factories, and many other factories have started operation.
    The growing army of construction workers has received great care. It is particularly obvious that now residential buildings with an area of ​​100,000 square meters have been completed. Many cultural, daily life, and commercial buildings, including four middle schools, four kindergartens, three clubs, a bread factory, etc., are under construction.
    Our great construction project has received the care and support of the entire Soviet country. We do not feel any lack of anything. Excavators and trucks, steel bars and cement, wood and bricks – all of these are supplied to us in such quantities that we can complete the planned
    All necessities are fully guaranteed. Our hydroelectric power station construction workers are full of creativity and are confident that they will never disappoint people's expectations in front of the motherland and in front of the people. The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station will start generating electricity in 1955.

    伏尔加河上的伟大建筑
    苏联古比雪夫水力发电站建筑工程总工程师　沙波希尼科夫
    编者按：今年八月二十一日是苏联部长会议发布关于在古比雪夫附近建筑大水力发电站决定的两周年，我们特发表古比雪夫水力发电站建筑工程总工程师沙波希尼科夫同志写的这篇文章，介绍工程进展的情况。
    苏联政府发布在伏尔加河上古比雪夫附近建筑大水力发电站的决定到现在已经两年了。水力发电站的整个建筑工程需时五年完成。有一个数字可以对在这样短的时间内应该完成的工程提供一个概念：土方工程的体积达一亿五千万立方公尺。如果将这些土壤装载在前后连接的火车车厢内，其长度可以环绕赤道四周。
    古比雪夫水力发电站是世界上最大的水力发电站。它的发电能力约二百万瓩。在水位正常的年份、水电站将发出约一百亿瓩时的廉价电力。这些电力将供应莫斯科、古比雪夫与萨拉托夫的工业企业。相当大的一部分电力将用来灌溉伏尔加河沿岸草原上的一百万公顷的干旱土地。这里将生长起极珍贵的农作物——小麦。
    苏联人民把这个建筑，以及列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河、斯大林格勒水力发电站、土库曼大运河和卡霍夫卡水电站等都叫做共产主义建设、斯大林建设，因为这些建设工程是在苏联人民的领袖斯大林建议之下进行的。这些建设工程的实现，将保证国家经济和文化的新的高涨与繁荣。
    两年来，在古比雪夫附近的伏尔加河岸上，发生了意义重大的改变。这就是一九五一年的一些总结：去年古比雪夫水力发电站完成了八百多万立方公尺土方的工程，落成了七万平方公尺以上面积的住宅区。在河的左右两岸，建筑了通往未来堤坝的基坑的铁路，架设了二百公里以上的高压电线。
    一九五二年的建筑计划相当于去年的三倍多。仅土方工程就达二千八百万立方公尺。必须指出，其中水力机械化部分就占去一千八百万立方公尺。建筑工程现在开始了新的阶段——浇灌水电站主要工程的混凝土，即水力发电站工程的基础和通航运河下面部分的水闸的建筑物。第一批装置有碎石机装备的自动混凝土工厂能够在一昼夜之间保证出产六千立方公尺的混凝土。
    整个建筑工程的期限和规模精确地按照通过的计划和规定的工作进程表进行。这样，一九五一年的建筑装配工程计划已提前完成。同样，我们也提前完成了一九五二年头半年的计划。这就使得我们有可能在建筑过程中大大地增加速度、扩大工程的工地和规模。
    为了使古比雪夫水力发电站主要建筑物的混凝土工程能在第二年年底开始动工，古比雪夫水电站工程的水力机械人员、掘土机手和技师们完成了真正巨大的工程。在水电站基坑周围修建了伏尔加河上第一道堤坝的工人们，把河床提高了四百公尺。在河的左岸出现了由钢桩、砂石筑成的堤坝，牢固地捍卫着水电站的基坑。
    在这个堤坝后面的基坑里，成百部机器——电力掘土机、吸泥机、巨型载重卡车、自卸卡车、开路机正在工作着。苏维埃人精确地掌握着这种技术，亲手创造了奇迹。在建筑工地内外传诵著名的掘土机手——工作队长华西里·腊敏娜、米哈依尔·叶维茨、鲍里斯·科伐连科和其他等人的名字。
    这里要特别提一下以鲍里斯·科伐连科为首的青年掘土机手工作队。他们的强大掘土机器，在工地上首创了一个月内掘土十万立方公尺泥土的纪录。这种成绩之所以成为可能，在相当大的程度上有赖于改进了掘土机槽斗的构造。鲍里斯·科伐连科在工地上担任了掘土机手的工作后，就和乌拉尔的机器建筑工人一起合作，研究掘土机的构造。他非常注意掘土机的槽斗在煤层上掘土比之在潮湿的粘土上工作来得更有效果这件事。科伐连科产生了制造有新结构的槽斗的想法。大家都支持他。他的提议被接受，并改装了槽斗，掘土机的掘土率显著地提高了。
    我们的建筑场所就是真正的大学。人们在这里工作和学习。我们有培养极熟练的专家的教学工厂，有培养高度熟练的专家的水力技术专科学校和夜间工业专科学校。自由劳动的人们，深深关怀共同事业的国家的主人们所管理着的这个建筑物及其最完善的苏维埃技术，为创造性劳动开辟了无限的可能性。
    到今年年底在水电站的洼地将堆砌起成万立方公尺的混凝土。
    今年将进行另一个混凝土工程——通航运河的下面部分的水闸。它位于河的左岸。基坑水闸建筑的主要工程是由电力吸泥机完成着。今天它们的工作已达到建筑未来水闸的水平了。堵住着伏尔加河水的堤坝，保卫着两个基坑以及水电站和水闸的建筑物。例如，在河的左岸，堤坝伸展约五公里。伏尔加河的春汛是对古比雪夫水电站建筑工作者们的严重考验。但这两个堤坝——水力技术工程的重要建筑，必能经得起这种考验。
    今年春天水电站建筑工人们开始建筑第三道堤坝，它是围着溢水堤坝的基坑而建造的，其规模超过前两个。堤坝伸延约八公里。到今年年底，仅水力机械人员就要为这个堤坝冲积六百万立方公尺的土壤。堤坝上的不少土壤是由掘土机手和自动装卸卡车驾驶员联合工作队所堆积的。
    工程的巨大规模以及十分短促的期限，责成我们要机械化到最大限度，并绝对精确地计划整个的生产过程。去年建筑了铁路干线，而今年在建筑现场的所有土地上，要铺设直接抵达工地的新铁道的支线网。一切货物将从供应工厂直接送往那里，立刻运用或进行建筑。我们这里设有转运站。
    今年古比雪夫水电站的整个建筑工程是巨大的，但是在一九五三年它将发展到比一九五二年规模更大的程度。在我们的建筑工地上早已进行了各种准备，以胜利地完成这种跃进。生产技术基地大大地扩大了。两个机械修理工厂和两个自动修理工厂、四个修理厂和四个汽车场、两个木工厂以及许多其他的工厂开工了。
    正在成长着的建筑工人大军受到了巨大的关怀。特别明显的是，现在已有十万平方公尺面积的住宅落成了。许多文化的、日常生活的和工商业建筑物，其中包括四个中学、四个幼儿园、三个俱乐部、面包工厂等正在建筑中。
    我们的伟大建筑工程得到全苏维埃国家的关怀和支持。任何东西我们都不感到缺乏。掘土机和卡车，钢筋和水泥，木材和砖头——这一切都以这样的数量供给我们，使我们在规定期限内完成计划的
    一切必需品都得到充分的保证。我们水电站建筑工作者们，充满了创造力，并确信决不在祖国面前、在人民面前辜负人们的期望。古比雪夫水力发电站在一九五五年开始发电。
