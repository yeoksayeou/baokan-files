Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Should Further Strengthen the Enthusiasm for Production and Operation
Chen Shutong, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have brought about a completely new atmosphere across the country. Through these movements, industrial and commercial figures have been criticized and educated by the people of the whole country, and their political understanding has been improved compared to before. After the "Five-Anti" movement, the People's Government adopted a series of effective measures, such as expanding processing and ordering, reasonably adjusting labor and processing fees, adjusting regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences, lowering bank interest rates, expanding lending, improving taxation, and improving market management. These measures specifically implemented the principles proposed by Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council, in his speech at the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, which were to adjust the relationship between public and private sectors and the relationship between labor and capital on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Recently, various forms of materials exchange meetings have been held in various regions, which has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of private industrial and commercial figures for production and operation, and the national market has begun to show a lively atmosphere. Taking East China as an example, the turnover of public, private, and cooperative enterprises in the region in April was 100.45 percent of the same period last year, and in May it was 105.76 percent of the same period last year. The market situation in the whole region was even better in June and July. In June, the turnover of public, private, and cooperative enterprises in Shanghai exceeded 8.4 percent of the same period last year.

Under the strong support of the national economy and factual education, private industrial and commercial figures have shown a new and legitimate enthusiasm in business operations. This is first and foremost reflected in the national and rural materials exchange conferences, in which private industrial and commercial figures mostly compete to participate. For example, during the Fuzhou exchange conference, an admission ticket was used by eighteen people in rotation in one day. The recent Central South China materials exchange conference attracted more than 4,000 representatives from all over the country, and most of the representatives were able to actively exchange. For example, private industrial and commercial figures in Guangdong and other places generally exceeded the original plan, and some even completed the purchase and sale plan by more than six times. At the same time, the proportion of transactions by private merchants has gradually increased. In the Central South China materials exchange conference, private enterprises accounted for 37.6 percent of purchases and 21.4 percent of sales. In the East China materials exchange conference, the proportion of transactions by private merchants accounted for about 25 percent. In the materials exchange conferences at the provincial level in Jiangsu, Fujian, Anhui, and other provinces and in some special zones in Zhejiang and northern Jiangsu, the proportion of transactions by private merchants was 50 to 70 percent, and the proportion of transactions by private merchants in local primary markets was even greater. Recently, the purchase and sales figures of local private enterprises in the Nanchang materials exchange conference were 167 times greater than the transaction volume of Nanchang private merchants participating in the Central South China exchange conference in March, and 30.4 times greater than the transaction volume of participating in the East China exchange conference in May.

Private enterprises have also shown a new atmosphere in terms of operating style. In order to expand business, industrial and commercial figures in various places have taken the initiative to contact production and sales areas to understand the situation and restore and establish trade relations. For example, Tianjin recently organized more than 200 people from 27 industries to go to Northeast and North China with samples and purchase and sales plans to conduct transactions. Tianjin Fushenghao, due to its adoption of the business policy of in-depth contact with production and sales areas, strengthening services, and small profits but quick turnover, achieved a turnover of 4 billion yuan from January to June with less than 200 million yuan of funds, and more than 1 billion yuan in July alone. As a result of improved management, reduced costs, and improved quality, private cigarette factories in Tianjin have opened up a sluggish situation. The sales volume of each factory in July increased by one to six times compared with May and June. Under the same circumstances, Shanghai's private papermaking industry's output in July exceeded the highest monthly output last year, an increase of 40 percent compared with the same period last year. The output of matches in Guangzhou in May and June reached the highest level before the war in 1936, exceeding the monthly output during the peak season last year. In addition, good results have been achieved in various places in fulfilling the signed contracts on schedule. For example, in June, the fulfillment of private industrial and commercial contracts in Shanghai accounted for 90.86 percent of the contracts that should have been fulfilled. Only a few were due to unexpected changes in production or transportation conditions, and the fulfillment was postponed or canceled with the consent of both parties to the contract. At the same time, the specifications and quality of the products were also strictly in accordance with the provisions of the contract. These situations all illustrate the tremendous changes in the operating style of private industrial and commercial figures after the "Five-Anti" movement.

However, it should be pointed out that at present, some private industrial and commercial figures still hold a negative attitude towards business operations because their understanding of the "Five-Anti" movement is not correct enough, and they still have some prejudices about the relationship between public and private sectors, taxation, and the relationship between labor and capital. Some shirk their responsibilities in factory production management, forming a phenomenon of no one being responsible; some still stick to the old set of styles and produce shoddy goods; some have serious dependence ideas, one-sidedly requiring state-owned trade to underwrite their slow-selling goods, and requiring the amount of loans to be equal to or even exceed their total operating funds. In addition, there are still a few industrial and commercial figures who still try to speculate in their operations, and even relapse into their old ways and repeat the "five poisons." For example, Tianjin Tongxingcheng Rubber Factory cut corners and reduced materials and falsely reported costs for processing military supplies; another example is that a few industrial and commercial figures in Tianjin resisted taxation. These phenomena actually occurred after the "Five-Anti" movement today, which cannot but be said to be serious. These lawless elements will be severely punished by the government and the people.

Now, the peak trading season after the autumn harvest is coming, and the country's large-scale economic construction will also begin. Our industrial and commercial figures must clearly recognize their due responsibility in prospering the market and national economic construction, and the bright future of legitimate private industry and commerce. After the "Five-Anti" movement, enterprise management has more favorable conditions. The facts in recent months have also proved that those who are engaged in economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and who can abide by government laws and actively engage in management have received government support and have achieved great development. Therefore, those who are currently active should become more active, and those who still have doubts, concerns, and are negative should immediately change their minds, correctly promote the enthusiasm for production and operation under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the working class, and strive to further prosper the market and welcome the country's large-scale economic construction.

Vigorously developing urban and rural materials exchange is an important link in promoting market prosperity at present, and it is also a favorable way to develop the business of private industry and commerce. Private industrial and commercial figures should make correct purchase and sales plans and actively participate in exchange meetings. In the future, they should pay special attention to the exchange business at the county and district levels, which is mainly based on short-distance exchanges. The contracts for the exchange of materials must be earnestly fulfilled, and the quantity, specifications, and delivery time of the products must meet the contract requirements. To this end, each enterprise should improve production management, promote advanced technology, reduce costs, improve quality, and hold labor-capital consultation meetings to achieve obedience to the leadership and supervision of the working class, labor-capital unity, and good production. In terms of purchase and sales, they should proceed in a planned manner according to the contract, establish new business ethics, and strictly prevent the "five poisons." They should also face the countryside, face the consumer masses, strengthen the spirit of service, and implement the policy of small profits but quick turnover, so as to continuously expand production and expand the scale and scope of exchanges.

Finally, I hope that our local federations of industry and commerce will strengthen the policy propaganda and education of members of the masses in future economic activities, do a good job of production mobilization and exchange organization in a planned and specific manner, and at the same time strengthen investigation and research, pay attention to new market situations and existing problems at any time, report the situation to the People's Government in a timely manner, make suggestions, and closely connect with the preparatory committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, so that our work can be better coordinated.

    私营工商业应进一步加强生产经营的积极性
    中华全国工商业联合会  筹备委员会主任委员  陈叔通
    “三反”、“五反”运动使全国气象焕然一新，经过这次运动，工商业者受到了全国人民的批评和教育，政治认识已较前提高。“五反”后，人民政府采取了一系列的有效措施，如扩大加工订货，合理地调整工缴费，调整地区差价与批发零售差价，降低银行利率，扩大放款，改进税收，改善市场管理等工作，具体的贯彻了中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会陈云主任在全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上的讲话中提出的在“三反”“五反”胜利的基础上调整公私关系、劳资关系的原则；最近各地区又举行了各种不同形式的物资交流会议，因而大大地鼓舞了私营工商业者生产和经营的积极性，全国市场已开始出现活跃的气象。以华东区为例，四月份全区公私营企业和合作社的营业额为去年同期的百分之一○○·四五，五月份为去年同期的百分之一百○五·七六，六、七月全区市场情况更好，六月份上海全市公私营企业和合作社营业额已超过去年同期百分之八·四。
    在国家经济大力扶持和事实教育下，私营工商业者在业务经营上出现了新的正当的积极性。首先明显地反映在各地城乡物资交流大会上，私营工商业者，大都争先参加。如福州市交流大会交易时，一张入场证在一天内竟有十八人轮流使用。最近中南区物资交流大会，到会地区代表遍及全国，达四千余人，大部分代表，都能积极交流，如广东等地私营工商业者，一般超过原订计划，个别甚至超过六倍的完成了购销计划。同时，私商交易比重，逐渐增加，中南区物资交流大会，购进方面私营占百分之三七·六，销售方面私营占百分之二一·四，华东区物资交流大会中，私商交易比重约占百分之二十五，苏南、福建、安徽等省区和浙江、苏北若干专区一级物资交流大会中，私商交易比重为百分之五十至百分之七十，各地初级市场的私商所占交易比重则更大。最近，南昌市物资交流大会中的本市私营企业购销数字，比三月间南昌市私商参加中南区交流大会的成交额大了一六七倍，比五月间参加华东区交流大会的成交额大三○·四倍。
    私营企业在经营作风方面，也出现了新的气象。为了扩展营业，各地工商业者主动联系产销地区了解情况，恢复和建立贸易关系。如天津市最近有二十七个行业组织了二百余人，携带样品和购销计划，分赴东北、华北各地进行交易。天津市复生号由于采取了深入联系产区销区，加强服务，薄利多销的经营方针，以不足两亿元资金，一月至六月，营业额达四十亿元，七月份一个月更超过十亿元。由于改善经营，降低成本，提高品质的结果，天津市各私营烟厂打开了滞销局面，七月份各厂销售量较五、六月增加一倍至六倍。同样情形下，上海私营造纸业，七月份产量已超过去年最高月产量，较去年同期增加百分之四十。广州市五、六月份的火柴产量达到了战前一九三六年的最高水平，超过去年最旺期的月产量。此外，各地在如期履行签订合同方面，也有很好的成绩，如六月份上海市私营工商业对到期合同的履行，已履行占应履行的百分之九十·八六，只有少数是由于生产或交通情况，发生意外变化，经由合同双方同意延期履行或予以取消。同时，产品规格和品质，也认真执行合同的规定。这些情形，都说明了私营工商业者在经过“五反”运动后，经营作风上的巨大转变。
    但是，应该指出，目前也还有部分私营工商业者，由于他们对“五反”运动的认识，还不够正确，对于公私关系、税收和劳资关系，都还存在着一些偏见，因而对业务经营抱消极态度。有的在工厂生产管理上，推脱责任，形成无人负责现象；有的至今还固守老一套作风，粗制滥造；有的存在着严重的依赖思想，片面地要求国营贸易包销其滞销货，要求贷款的数字与其全部购销数字相等，甚至超过其全部经营资金。另外，尚有少数工商业者，在经营上仍图投机取巧，甚至故态复萌，重犯“五毒”，如天津同兴成橡胶厂，对加工军用物资，偷工减料，虚报成本；又如天津市少数工商业者抗拒税收。这些现象，竟又发生在“五反”运动之后的今天，不能不说是严重的。这些不法分子，必将受到政府和人民的严惩。
    现在，秋收后的贸易旺季即将到来，国家大规模的经济建设，也就要开始，我们工商业者，必须明确认识自己在繁荣市场和国家经济建设中的应有责任和正当的私营工商业的光明前途。“五反”运动之后，企业经营更具备了有利条件，最近几个月来的事实，也已证明，凡是有利于国计民生的经济事业，而又能遵守政府法令积极从事经营者，均得到政府的扶助并获得了很大的发展。因此，目前表现积极的应该更加活跃起来，至今还有怀疑、顾虑、消极的，应该立刻转变过来，在国营经济和工人阶级领导下，正确地发扬生产和经营的积极性，为进一步繁荣市场和迎接国家大规模经济建设而努力。
    大力开展城乡物资交流，是目前促进市场繁荣的重要环节，也是发展私营工商业业务的有利途径。私营工商业者应做好正确的购销计划，积极参加交流会议，今后尤应重视县、区一级以短距离交流为主的交流业务。交流物资大会合同，必须切实履行，在产品数量、规格和交货时间方面都要符合合同规定。为此，各企业应改善生产管理，提倡先进技术，降低成本，提高质量，开好劳资协商会议，做到服从工人阶级领导与监督，劳资团结，搞好生产。在购销方面，应根据合同有计划地进行，树立新的商业道德，严格防止“五毒”。并要做到面向农村，面向消费群众，加强服务精神，贯彻薄利多销方针，从而达到不断扩大生产，扩大交流规模与范围。
    最后，希望我们各地工商业联合会，在今后的经济活动中，应加强对会员群众的政策宣传教育，有计划地、具体地做好生产动员和交流组织工作，同时加强调查研究，随时注意新的市场情况和存在的问题，适时的向人民政府反映情况，提出建议，并密切与全国工商业联合会筹备委员会的联系，使我们的工作更好地配合起来。
