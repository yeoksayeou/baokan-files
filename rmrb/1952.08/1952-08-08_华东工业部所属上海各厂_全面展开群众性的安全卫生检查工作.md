The mass safety and hygiene inspection campaign has been fully launched in state-owned, publicly owned, and joint state-private factories in Shanghai under the East China Industrial Department. By July 31st, workers in 38 factories under the department, including steel, machinery, electrical appliances, and chemical industries, had submitted more than 33,000 suggestions for improvement in safety and hygiene, creating favorable conditions for future safe production. In order to ensure the success of the safety and hygiene inspection, the East China Industrial Department sent five deputy ministers, eighteen bureau and division chiefs, and forty-four section chiefs to go deep into the factories to assist in the work. Currently, twenty factories have entered the processing stage, eighteen factories have widely mobilized the masses, and the inspection work in a small number of factories will soon be fully launched.

The rapid progress of safety and hygiene inspection work in various factories is due to the leadership's full mobilization and reliance on the masses. In the mobilization phase, each factory addressed the workers' idea that "suggestions have been made many times, but they are not useful" by having responsible cadres such as the Party Committee Secretary, Military Representative, or Factory Director openly review past mistakes in neglecting safety and hygiene work. At the same time, they adopted the method of "making suggestions, inspecting, and solving problems simultaneously" to further mobilize the masses, which achieved good results. For example, from July 12th to 18th, the workers of Huatong Electric Motor Factory only made more than 100 suggestions. After the leadership conducted two profound self-criticisms to everyone and immediately solved the female workers' request in the Third Workshop to add dust-proof caps, within two days, the factory workers submitted more than 2,000 suggestions for improvement related to safety and hygiene. The workers in each workshop automatically inspected every machine, every belt, and even every screw.

The facts of the safety and hygiene inspection work in various factories prove that as long as the leaders at all levels earnestly mobilize and rely on the masses, improving safety and hygiene conditions will be very smooth. Among the more than 33,000 suggestions made by the workers, almost every suggestion is followed by a solution, of which more than 25,000 suggestions can be solved by spending a small amount of money or without spending any money. For example, after the workers of Tianyuan and Tianli Electrochemical Plants put forward more than 3,000 suggestions, the administrative leaders were initially a little afraid, and some cadres said: "So many problems cannot be solved in three years." However, after mobilizing the workers to use their brains to find solutions, the workers used waste materials and made improvements in their spare time. Some did not cost a penny, and some only cost a small amount of money to solve 90%. The iron weight of the large kiln gate of the plant was very dangerous and needed to be fitted with a protective fence. The workers found some scrap iron and old materials to remodel it, and the installation was completed without spending a penny. The workers of the factory said: "Safety and hygiene are our own business." We should make more suggestions, use our brains more, do more, and think of more ways. Facts have also proved that through mass inspections, not only the unreasonable situations in factory production management, the cooperation of various departments, labor organization, and operating procedures have been exposed, creating important conditions for future production reform and democratic management; at the same time, because the threat to workers' safe production has been eliminated, the production enthusiasm of the workers has also been improved. For example, after the inspection of Tianyuan and Tianli Electrochemical Plants, the daily output of bleaching powder increased by 44% compared with before the inspection. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 华东工业部所属上海各厂  全面展开群众性的安全卫生检查工作

    华东工业部所属上海各厂
    全面展开群众性的安全卫生检查工作
    群众性的安全卫生大检查，已在华东工业部所属上海各国营、公营及公私合营的工厂中全面展开。到七月三十一日，该部所属钢铁、机械、电器、化工等三十八个工厂的职工，已提出有关安全卫生方面的改进意见，达三万三千多件，为今后进行安全生产创造了有利条件。华东工业部为了把安全卫生大检查作好，特派出五个副部长、十八个局长和处长及四十四个科长，分别深入各厂协助进行工作。目前，已有二十个工厂进入处理阶段，十八个工厂广泛的发动了群众，还有少数工厂的检查工作最近就要全面展开。
    各厂安全卫生检查工作进展得如此迅速，是由于领导方面充分发动与依靠群众的结果。各厂在发动群众阶段，都针对职工“提了好多次意见，都没有用处”的想法，由党委书记、军代表或厂长等负责干部，在职工面前公开检讨过去不重视安全卫生工作的错误，同时还采用“边提意见、边检查、边解决问题”的方式，进一步发动群众，收到了良好的效果。如华通电机厂从七月十二日到十八日，工人们只提出了一百多条意见，后经领导方面向大家进行了两次深刻的检讨，又立即解决了第三工场女工提出增添遮灰帽子的要求，于是在两天内，全厂工人又提出了两千多条有关安全卫生的改进意见。各车间的工人，都自动地检查每一部机器、每一根皮带甚至每一颗螺丝。
    各厂进行安全卫生检查工作的事实证明：只要各级领导方面认真地发动与依靠了群众，改进安全卫生条件是十分顺利的。在职工们所提出的三万三千多条意见中，差不多每条都是一条意见后面跟着一个解决办法，其中有二万五千多条意见都是花少数钱或不花钱就可以解决的。如天原和天利电化厂的职工提出三千多条意见后，行政领导方面起初有些害怕，有的干部说：“这样多的问题，三年也解决不完。”但是，发动职工群众动脑筋找办法以后，工人们利用废料，在工余时间进行改进，有的不花一个钱，有的只花少数钱就解决了百分之九十。该厂大窑闸门的铁重头很危险，需要加装防护栅，工人们就找了些废铁、旧料改制起来，结果没有花一个钱就安装好了。该厂工人说：“安全卫生是我们自己的事。”应当作到多提意见、多动脑筋、多动手、多想办法。事实还证明：通过群众性的检查，不但暴露了工厂生产管理、各部门的工作配合、劳动组织及操作规程等方面的不合理的情况，为今后进行生产改革和民主管理创造了重要条件；同时由于解除了工人安全生产的威胁，广大工人的生产情绪也提高了。如天原和天利电化厂在检查后，漂粉日产量比检查前提高了百分之四十四。（新华社）
