The militia and the people's self-defense forces are armed organizations of the people who do not leave production. They are a unique product of the Chinese people's revolution and one of the manifestations of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking. It has a glorious history of struggle in the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. As early as the domestic revolutionary war period from 1927 to 1936, the people in the revolutionary base areas established organizations such as the Red Guards. These mass armed forces played a major role in coordinating the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to carry out the land revolution struggle, in expanding the Red Army, and in smashing the Kuomintang reactionary army's many encirclements and suppressions. In the struggle to defeat the Japanese aggressors and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, the running dogs of American imperialism, the militia and self-defense forces were powerful assistants and powerful reserve forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, making significant contributions. This armed force has grown from 2.2 million during the War of Resistance Against Japan to 5.5 million during the Third Revolutionary Civil War. Now, it has become the powerful reserve force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army of ×× million people all over mainland China, and a powerful assistant to the Chinese People's Liberation Army in defending the motherland and defending world peace.

    The Militia during the War of Resistance Against Japan

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Communist Party regarded the construction of the militia as an important aspect of the construction of the anti-Japanese base areas and as an important part of the army-building plan, regarding the militia, guerrillas, and regular army as a three-in-one military organization. Party committees at all levels and military regions transferred many outstanding cadres to participate in the militia construction work; the people's government used various methods to improve the political status of the militia, reward militia heroes, and promote revolutionary heroism; the army allocated a certain number of weapons to the militia and helped them conduct military and political training. Therefore, in the Liberated Areas, the organization of the militia and self-defense forces gradually developed and grew stronger with the changes in the situation of the enemy and us, and with the development of mass movements such as rent reduction and interest reduction and democratic political construction.

These armed people democratically elected their own squad leaders, platoon leaders, and company commanders, and established their own leading organs – people's armed committees at all levels. Under the leadership of the people's armed committees at all levels, villages set up companies, districts set up battalions, and counties set up regiments, unified command, unified dispatch, and became a unified combat system.

The militia's weapons initially consisted of native guns, cannons, and red-tasseled spears, with a few people using some grenades and rifles allocated by the army. After they used these weapons to achieve victory, they actively created and added various weapons. Some donated money to purchase them, and some built factories to manufacture them themselves. Therefore, hand grenades, landmines, stone mines, magnetic mines, "one-shot Mausers," and rifle bullets made from modified waste cartridges increased significantly in many areas. They used these very poor weapons to fight against the Japanese imperialists, who had modern equipment, and used them to seize the enemy's new weapons and arm themselves. Therefore, by the middle of the War of Resistance Against Japan, they already had a variety of weapons: Japanese-made Type 38 rifles, Mauser pistols, and light machine guns.

An American journalist once described the militia and self-defense forces during the War of Resistance Against Japan in this way:

"At the entrance of each village, militiamen in plain clothes guarded, carrying all kinds of captured Japanese weapons, from Tommy guns to hand grenades, and all kinds of local weapons, from muzzle-loading cannons firing landmines to red-tasseled spears. When anyone approached, villagers, often women or children, either herding sheep or spinning thread, blocked the road and demanded to see passes.

"If there was any delay, guerrillas immediately appeared from behind nearby thatched houses or bushes. The passes had to be clear. Everyone had to produce a pass, whether in uniform or not." The American journalist wrote:

"If the enemy moves, the people of the nearest village immediately get a report from the mounted scouts at the gate of the Japanese garrison. The alarm bells ring, the people hide their food and retreat into the mountains, and the militia lay landmines and set up traps. News is transmitted to other villages by simple methods, such as beacon fires or lowering flags on hilltops." He also wrote:

"The army and militia allow the Japanese to enter a certain distance, and then salute them with a series of ambushes and makeshift encirclements." (See "The Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army in the Eight Years of the War of Resistance" pages 210-212. Edited by the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the Eighteenth Group Army, published by the North China Xinhua Bookstore.) It should be mentioned that the thing that the militia feared the most was the widespread and skillful use of landmines. Once the enemy stepped into the Liberated Area, they were like being caught in a minefield, unable to advance or retreat, unable to sit or lie down in peace, and in constant danger of death.

In order to deal with the Japanese invaders' "Three Alls Policy," the militia led the villagers in implementing "empty houses and clear fields," transferring or burying grain, firewood, and all infrequently used items. The people only prepared a carrying pole with a simple bundle of luggage at one end and pots, bowls, basins, spoons, and a small amount of food at the other. Whenever there was enemy activity, people would carry their burdens and move; the militia would cooperate with the army to fight the enemy near the villages, preventing the enemy from advancing and covering everyone's safe transfer. Whenever spring plowing and autumn harvesting came, and the enemy went out to plunder, the militia cooperated with the army to attack the enemy day and night, covering the masses in spring plowing and autumn harvesting, so that the enemy's carts and mules, which were prepared to seize grain, often could only carry their own corpses and wounded soldiers back.

The militia also frequently learned the methods used by the army to conduct political warfare against the enemy, attacking and disintegrating the enemy and puppet personnel spiritually, suppressing enemy spy activities, and destroying puppet regimes. They persuaded some of the enemy and puppet personnel, secretly monitored others, and openly punished others, causing them to leave the puppet regime or actually work for us.

The rear traffic war was mainly undertaken by the militia and the masses. In the autumn of 1940, in the famous "Hundred Regiments Offensive" launched by our army, 350,000 people in the central Hebei area alone participated in the struggle to destroy roads. In 1942, the militia in northwestern Shanxi alone harvested more than 10,000 catties of enemy wires, destroyed more than 40 walls, and burned more than 20 bridges. In January 1943, the militia and armed forces and the people of the coastal area of Shandong, in order to cooperate with the anti-"mopping up" campaign in the Yimeng area, launched a continuous four-day Wanren Great Destruction campaign on the Lin (Yi) Zhu (Cheng) Highway, which stretched for 200 li from Jiuqudian in the north to Chongxing in the south, from Shadun in the west to Guojiawan in the east. Under the cover of the militia, men, women, old and young picked up shovels, spades, and hoes to break roads, burn bridges, destroy watchtowers, level walls, and cut electric wires. In order to persist in a long-term struggle, the militia, self-defense forces, and people in various places also transformed the terrain. The plains of central Hebei and southern Hebei almost all roads were dug into ditches eight feet wide and about ten feet deep, so that the enemy's fast troops could not move here, but the "ditches" could cover the transfer of the anti-Japanese military and civilians, so the masses called them "anti-Japanese ditches." In 1943, various parts of southern Hebei further transformed the terrain. Even people who were very familiar with the local terrain were often confused by the new terrain. The Yancheng area of northern Jiangsu launched a movement to dig ditches and build dams, so that the villages in the plains were connected, and the ditches were connected. The water network area was sealed off layer by layer, so that the enemy's motorboats could not move. Central Hebei, southern Hebei, and other places further carried out tunnel warfare, digging tunnels about four feet high and three feet wide underground, connecting villages and townships, and even counties, so that hundreds of miles could be freely transferred without leaving the ground, forming an underground transportation network. The tunnels have many hidden entrances and exits, large and small bunkers, many twists and turns, many forks, air vents, and simple anti-virus equipment. Ingenious camouflage is also set up at the entrances and exits, and pitfalls are set up, and landmines are buried on the left, right, up and down of the entrances and exits, so that one can attack or defend. In the mountainous areas such as Taihang, the militia also led the masses to open up cave dwellings like tunnels in the mountain ravines. These huge projects are all the creation of tens of thousands or millions of people.

The militia adopted highly decentralized tactics to wear down the enemy. They were in groups of three and five, all over the mountains and plains, appearing and disappearing without a fixed place, and cooperating with the regular army and guerrillas to strike the enemy at any time and any place, putting the enemy in a state of panic. When they encountered a powerful enemy, they temporarily dispersed and hid, and flexibly looked for opportunities to strike the enemy. Everyone called this combat style "sparrow warfare." An even more important means of killing and wounding the enemy was landmines, which was a combination of rifles and landmines: if the enemy did not step on a landmine, they would use rifles to shoot, causing the enemy to panic or be forced into a minefield or mine cluster. Li Yong, a first-class militia hero in the Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-Japanese Base Area, and his team used the tactics of combining guns and mines to kill or wound 364 enemy and puppet troops and destroy 25 enemy vehicles in an anti-"mopping up" campaign.

After 1943, the militia organization expanded further with the widespread and in-depth development of the rent reduction and interest reduction movement, and became stronger as it was further tempered by the war. The militia captured more weapons from the Japanese invaders and armed themselves; they enriched themselves with more combat experience. They were not only able to cooperate with the army to smash the enemy's "mopping up" operations, but also able to actively attack the enemy, encircle the enemy, remove the enemy's strongholds, and expand the base areas. They were not only able to cooperate with the army to strike the enemy, but also able to stand alone and persist in combat in the temporary absence of main forces. This made the army's operations more mobile, and the opportunities to annihilate a large number of enemies increased.

During this period, the joint defense operations implemented by the militia in the heartland of the Liberated Areas were more advanced than the highly decentralized "sparrow warfare" and the struggle to defend the villages in the previous period. The so-called joint defense operation is that, according to the natural terrain and combat needs, the militia of several villages jointly formulate a joint defense convention. If something happens in one village, several villages will provide reinforcements and jointly encircle and attack the enemy. Zhai Baixiao, a militia hero in Lan County, Jin Sui Base Area, united the militia in many villages and established a joint defense alert line as long as 80 li, with densely deployed sentries and smooth intelligence. When the enemy and puppets came, they would be attacked by countless militia from all directions. In June 1944, more than 500 enemy and puppet troops drew up a seven-day "mopping up" plan and launched a large-scale invasion. The militia, who cooperated in this operation, fought so hard that they were dizzy. After only two days of "mopping up," they fled back in embarrassment. There were many joint defense organizations like this or even stronger in the anti-Japanese base areas at that time.

During this period, in order to support the struggle of the militia in the marginal areas, the militia in the heartland of the Liberated Areas formed temporary "rotation teams" and "armed work teams" that left production, and went to the marginal areas bordering the enemy in rotation, cooperating with the local militia to actively launch military or political offensives against the enemy, encircling the enemy's strongholds, so that the enemy did not dare to take a step out of the stronghold; or cooperating with the regular army to remove the enemy's strongholds and expand the base areas. According to incomplete statistics in 1943, the enemy strongholds besieged by the militia in cooperation with the army or alone included Zhilan and Chakou strongholds in the Eighth Military Sub-district of the Jin-Sui Military Region; Panlong Town in Wuxiang County in the Taihang Mountains; Qinyuan and Yanzhai strongholds in the Taiyue Mountains; Southwest Sheng strongholds in the Beiyue District; Yefang and Changweizi strongholds southeast of Xuzhou in northern Jiangsu; and Baishan and Duozhuang strongholds in central and southern Shandong.

The militia's landmine warfare also shifted from explosive defense to explosive offense. The militiamen said: "Our landmines must be able to walk and run to the vicinity of the enemy's stronghold to explode."

In 1944, in the struggle of the militia in the Taiyue District to besiege Qinyuan City, they used 5,000 landmines to set up many minefields, mine clusters, and mine nets, so that the enemy did not dare to leave the city, and 940 lives were lost in the sound of landmine explosions, and finally abandoned the city and fled.

The militia's adoption of various methods to strike the enemy resulted in remarkable achievements. According to the statistics of the materials in 1943 alone, the militia in the Shandong Military Region fought 8,852 times in one year, killing, wounding, and capturing 6,809 enemy and puppet troops; the militia in a certain sub-district of the Beiyue District fought 396 times in one year, killing, wounding, and capturing 380 enemy and puppet troops, including the bombing of enemy chief Ite, a major; the militia in the Taihang District fought 15,349 times in one year, killing, wounding, and capturing 1,132 enemy and puppet troops; the militia in northwestern Shanxi fought 1,208 times in half a year (April to September) in 1943, killing, wounding, and capturing 665 enemy and puppet troops. In addition, the militia in central Hebei, southern Hebei-Shandong-Henan, southern Hebei, Taiyue, central China, and southern China also achieved great results. It is roughly estimated that in 1943 alone, the militia in the Liberated Areas killed, wounded, and captured no less than 50,000 Japanese and puppet troops.

In August 1945, the Soviet Union sent troops to the Northeast and quickly eliminated one million of the Japanese invading elite Kwantung Army. The Japanese authorities were forced to announce their unconditional surrender. However, because the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group colluded with the Japanese and puppets under the direction of American imperialism and instigated the Japanese and puppet troops to refuse to surrender to our Liberated Area military and civilians, the militia again participated in the army and the war on a large scale and joined the People's Liberation Army in the counter-offensive. The militia cooperated with the regular army to recover lost territories on the one hand, and fought back against the attacks of the Kuomintang bandit troops from behind on the other hand. The ever-victorious People's Liberation Army and the long-trained militia finally defeated the enemy and won the victory.

In the counter-offensive, the militia surged into the counter-offensive battlefield in entire companies, battalions, and even entire regiments on the basis of the "rotation team" and "armed work team." They were responsible for rescuing the wounded, guarding prisoners, blockading key points, building fortifications, battlefield alerts, feint attacks, containment, siege, and other combat tasks, cooperating with the regular army to recover the enemy's peripheral strongholds and directly approaching transportation routes and major cities.

The militia in the Taihang Mountains participated in the war with 450,000 people (including self-defense forces) in several months of counter-offensive. In addition to cooperating with the army to recover the towns of Lincheng, Xiangyuan, Fengfeng, and Guantai, they also fought alone 666 times, killing, wounding, and capturing 1,467 Japanese and puppet troops. In the Taiyue Mountains, the militia expeditionary force participating in the war in entire battalions and regiments reached more than 15,000 people in two months of counter-offensive (not including self-defense forces and scattered militia participating in the war). In addition to cooperating with the regular army to recover many towns such as Pinglu and Xiaxian, they also achieved great results alone. According to statistics from only ten counties, about 2,000 enemy and puppet officers and soldiers, including deputy division commanders and below, were killed, wounded, or captured.

In short, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the militia and the people's self-defense forces stood with the army on the front line of the War of Resistance Against Japan from beginning to end, playing a major role in finally defeating the Japanese invaders. Chairman Mao said: "The reason why this army (referring to the People's Liberation Army) is powerful is also because there are such vast mass armed organizations as the people's self-defense forces and the militia, which cooperate with it in combat. In the Chinese Liberated Areas, all young men and women, and even old men and women, are organized into the anti-Japanese people's self-defense forces on a voluntary, democratic, and non-separated from production basis. The capable elements in the self-defense forces, in addition to those who join the army and guerrillas, are organized into the militia. Without the cooperation of these mass armed forces, it would be impossible to defeat the Japanese invaders." (April 24, 1945 "On the Coalition Government")

The Militia during the Third Revolutionary Civil War

During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the militia created more glorious historical traces than during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

The vigorous land reform movement in the Liberated Areas and the dark and gloomy tragedy in the Chiang-controlled areas and the Kuomintang bandit army's mad attacks on the Liberated Areas formed a sharp contrast, which aroused the high hatred and fighting spirit of the vast number of people and militia against the enemy. The vast number of militia showed an invincible heroic spirit in participating in the war.

In the early days of the Third Revolutionary Civil War, due to the Kuomintang bandit army's mad attacks and the People's Liberation Army's concentration of forces to carry out the policy of mobile annihilation warfare, one of the main tasks of the militia and self-defense forces was still to carry out guerrilla warfare and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to defend the Liberated Areas. However, at this time, they could not only fight in a decentralized manner to wear down the enemy, but also fight in a more concentrated manner and annihilate the enemy in batches. In a small area in the Taiyue Mountains, the militia killed, wounded, and captured more than 11,000 bandit troops in one year from July 1946 to June 1947.

The militia launched a larger-scale explosive offensive and a more powerful blockade and siege against the Kuomintang bandit army entrenched in strongholds. The militia in the Taihang and Taiyue Mountains created "explosive joint defense," "flying explosion," "blockade and siege," "minefield," "mine net," "horse trap pit," and other tactics, putting the Kuomintang bandit army in a predicament where every tree and bush was a soldier and every stone was a mine.

The militia's method of dealing with the enemy who disturbed our villages from within the strongholds was to let them "enter easily and leave with difficulty." The joint defense battle became stronger. On December 9, 1947, four battalions of bandit troops stationed in Anyang (now under the jurisdiction of Pingyuan Province) attacked our hinterland in six routes. When they advanced to the Gangxi area, they fell into the minefield of our local militia. The bandit army was in chaos and fled back in embarrassment. The militia, who had been prepared in advance, attacked from all directions. Although the bandit army retreated, it suffered 51 casualties.

It was no longer uncommon for the militia to annihilate small groups of enemies and remove strongholds without the cooperation of the main force during the Third Revolutionary Civil War. The militia led by Liu Huaisong in Xiuwu County (now under the jurisdiction of Pingyuan Province) in the Taihang Mountains disguised themselves as bandit troops and went deep into the enemy area, capturing all 44 members of the medical team under the cover of a platoon of bandit troops without firing a shot. The Tangyin militia, with the cooperation of a small number of guerrillas, annihilated a squad of bandit troops in the Shangzhuang stronghold in one and a half hours, killing 5 enemies and capturing 11 enemies. The Pinglu militia in the Taiyue Mountains sank enemy ships on the Yellow River and annihilated more than 70 members of the puppet county government's armed forces. Zhang Ximan's combat team, a militia hero in Jiexiu County, Shanxi, annihilated an entire company of enemies (110 people) in the Sendai battle and captured all personnel and guns.

The above are several main combat methods. In addition, the militia also used
"digging out the heart," "eagle catching rabbit," "intimidation warfare" and other tactics to capture scattered enemy and puppet personnel or important officials everywhere, creating an extreme state of terror for the enemy.

In July 1947, our army began a strategic counter-offensive. In the counter-offensive, the militia was put into battle on a larger scale.

The participating militia were no longer decentralized small organizations, but had organizations that were roughly the same as the army organizations, and there were command organizations from companies to regiments. Some of these militia teams were called "Children's Soldiers Regiment," and some were called "Backbone Regiment" or "Field Militia Regiment." About fifty such militia regiments were based in Shandong. Thirty-six were in the Taiyue Mountains. A dozen or dozens of regiments were based in the Taihang Mountains, the Lvliang Mountains, and in each Liberated Area. They took turns to mobilize and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to participate in various major battles.

The participating organizations of the Self-Defense Forces were even larger, with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people participating in the work of supporting the front line. They also had squads, platoons, companies, and even battalions and regiments' organizational and command organs. Under the unified command, they were responsible for transporting ammunition and food, rescuing and transporting the wounded, and helping soldiers build fortifications and other war services. They often volunteered to participate in war service, so they showed a high degree of awareness and a high degree of organization and discipline when completing various tasks.

This large army of the people became an indispensable and important force in every battlefield and major battle of the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive, such as the Liaoshen Campaign and Jinzhou Campaign in the Northeast, the Jinan Campaign and Huaihai Campaign, and the Shanghai Campaign in East China. They not only participated in many large and small battles within the scope of this area, but also participated in long-distance battles for thousands of miles, some lasting up to a year. For example, the Children's Soldiers Regiment formed by the Shandong militia followed the army to Fujian; the "Field Regiment" or "Backbone Regiment" formed by the Shanxi militia went as far west as Liangzhou, Gansu, as far north as Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia, and as far south as the Funiu Mountains south of the Yellow River; the expeditionary force of the Hebei militia went as far north as Chahar and as far south as the south bank of the Yellow River; and the militia in Longdong, Shaanxi, cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to expedition to Ningxia, Gansu, and Sichuan. The scale of participation in the war, the length of time, and the distance were unprecedented. They were not only responsible for transporting grain and ammunition, repairing railways, covering transportation, and rescuing the wounded, but also responsible for escorting prisoners of war, capturing scattered bandits, battlefield alerts, and other combat tasks, and actively helping the troops annihilate the enemy.

In addition to a large number of long-distance participation in the war, due to the fact that the main force was transferred to the counter-offensive front line, the rear main force was small, and the militia and self-defense forces left in the rear were also responsible for the major tasks of surrounding and blockading the enemy's isolated strongholds, suppressing remnants of bandits and secret agents, and consolidating the rear.

During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the militia and self-defense forces also made a special contribution, that is, a large number of them participated in the People's Liberation Army. Under the encouragement of the victory of the war, the militia in many areas often joined the army collectively in large numbers with their commanders. After the militia joined the army, they only needed to undergo a short period of training before they could go to the front line to fight, and under the active help of the veteran soldiers in the battle, their combat effectiveness was rapidly improved.

The Militia Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China

Since the birth of the People's Republic of China, the militia system has been stipulated as one of the military systems of the People's Republic of China. Article 23 of the Common Program of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference stipulates: “The People’s Republic of China implements the militia system to protect local order, establish a national mobilization foundation, and prepare to implement the compulsory military service system at an appropriate time.” This puts forward new tasks and new development directions for the militia.

In the past three years, the militia has been increasingly universally established throughout the country. Under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, a unified organization and a unified system have been established, and it has rapidly developed into an army of ×× million (excluding self-defense forces) in mass movements such as land reform, resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and patriotic high yield. They have taken on the glorious tasks of annihilating remnants of bandits, defending the coast and border, protecting the progress of land reform, protecting production and construction, and suppressing counter-revolutionary activities in the stance of masters, in coordination with the People's Liberation Army and local public security forces, becoming one of the important forces in maintaining revolutionary order and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

Since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and occupied our territory of Taiwan, it has continued to violate our country's territorial waters and airspace. The people of the whole country are outraged by the aggressive actions of American imperialism, and have launched a great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country. The militia in the Northeast, which is at the forefront of national defense, on the one hand, volunteers to organize stretcher teams, transport teams, etc. to resist US aggression and aid Korea and go to the Korean front to cooperate with the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to fight and attack the American aggressors; on the other hand, they strengthen their preparedness and guard the river defense and the border of the motherland day and night, preparing to attack any aggressors who dare to invade our country's border. The militia in other parts of the country also participated in the Chinese People's Volunteers by the thousands in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The militia left in the rear also redoubled their efforts to consolidate the security of the rear.

Now, the militia organization is continuing to develop. After the realization of the universal militia system, the militia will have greater development. At the same time, they are closely watching the aggressive actions of American imperialism, actively strengthening training, and preparing to respond to the call of the motherland at any time.

With the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army, and with the mass armed forces as the powerful assistant and reserve force of the People's Liberation Army, any aggressive conspiracy of imperialism will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

    中国人民解放军的有力助手和强大后备军——民兵
    人民革命军事委员会人民武装部资料组
    民兵和人民自卫队，是不脱离生产的人民群众的武装组织，是中国人民革命的特殊产物，是毛主席战略思想的体现形式之一。它在中国人民的解放事业中，有着光荣的斗争历史。早在一九二七至一九三六年的国内革命战争时期，革命根据地的人民就建立了赤卫队等组织。这些群众武装对于配合中国工农红军进行土地革命斗争，对于扩大红军和粉碎蒋介石反动军队的多次围攻，都起了重大的作用。在战胜日本侵略者和消灭美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石匪军的斗争中，民兵、自卫队是中国人民解放军的有力助手和强大的后备力量，作了重大的贡献。这支武装力量由抗日战争时期的二百二十万人，发展到第三次国内革命战争时期的五百五十万人，现在更成为遍布全国大陆的××万人的中国人民解放军的强大后备军，成为中国人民解放军为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的强大的助手。
    抗日战争时期中的民兵
    抗日战争时期，中国共产党把民兵建设当作抗日根据地建设的一个重要方面，当作建军计划的重要部分，把民兵、游击队和正规军作为三位一体的军事组织。各级党委、各个军区抽调了许多优秀干部参加民兵建设工作；人民政府用各种方法提高民兵的政治地位，奖励民兵英雄，发扬革命英雄主义；军队则抽出一定数量的武器发给民兵，并帮助其进行军事政治训练。因之，在解放区，民兵和自卫队的组织，随着敌我斗争形势的变化，随着减租减息、民主建政等群众运动的开展而逐步发展壮大起来。
    这些武装起来的人民群众，以民主的方式选举了自己的小队长、分队长和中队长等，并建立了自己的领导机关——各级人民武装委员会。在各级人民武装委员会领导之下，村设中队、区设大队、县设总队，统一指挥，统一调遣，成为一个统一的战斗体系。
    民兵的武器，在开始只有土枪、土炮和红缨枪，少数人使用着由军队所拨给的一些手榴弹和步枪。当他们运用这些武器取得胜利之后，就积极创造和添置各种武器。有的捐款购置，有的设厂自造。因此，手榴弹、地雷、石雷、磁雷、一响毛瑟、废弹壳改装的步枪子弹等，在许多地区大量增加。他们就用这些很坏的武器和有着近代化装备的敌人——日本帝国主义进行斗争，并用以夺取敌人的新式武器，武装自己。因之，在抗日战争的中期，他们已经有了多种多样的武器：日造的三八式步枪、驳壳枪和轻机关枪。
    一位美国记者曾经这样描写抗日战争时期的民兵和自卫队：
    “每一村的进口处有便衣民兵守卫着，他们带着各种各式的缴获的日本武器，从汤姆枪到手榴弹，各种各样的当地武器，从前膛炮发射的地雷到红缨枪。当任何人走近时，村人、常常是妇女或儿童，或在放羊或在纺线，挡住了路，要看路条。
    “如有任何延迟，游击队马上从邻近的茅草房子或是树丛后面出现了。路条是一点也含糊不得的。个个人都得拿出路条来，无论是穿军衣或不穿的。”这位美国记者写道：
    “如果敌人移动，最近村子里的人们马上就得到驻在日本驻屯的大门口的骑马侦探的报告。警钟响了，人民把粮食收藏起来，躲避到山里去，民兵去敷设地雷，和布置好圈套。消息以简单的方法，如烽火、或打下山顶上的旗杆之类传到别的村子去。”又写道：
    “军队和民兵允许日本人进入到某种距离，然后敬以一连串的埋伏和临时性的包围。”（见“抗战八年来的八路军与新四军”一书第二一○——二一二页。第十八集团军总政治部宣传部编，华北新华书店版）应当提到，民兵最使敌人害怕的东西，还是广泛巧妙地使用着的地雷。敌人一踏入解放区，就如陷入雷阵一样，进退两难，坐卧不安，随处都有死亡的危险。
    为了对付日本强盗的“三光政策”，民兵领导着村民进行空室清野，把粮食、柴草和一切不常用的东西都转移出去或埋藏起来。老百姓只准备一付挑篮，一头是捆好的简单的行李，一头是锅、碗、盆、杓和少许食粮。一有敌情，人们便挑起担子转移；民兵就配合军队在村庄附近和敌人进行战斗，阻止敌人前进，掩护大家安全转移。每当春耕秋收、敌人四出掠夺时，民兵就配合军队日夜袭击敌人，掩护群众进行春耕和秋收，使敌人准备抢粮用的大车、驮骡，常常只能载着自己的死尸和伤兵回去。
    民兵还经常学习军队所用的办法，对敌人进行政治战，从精神上打击和瓦解敌伪人员，镇压敌探奸细活动，摧毁伪政权。对于敌伪人员，有的进行劝说，有的暗地监视，有的公开惩办，使其脱离伪政权或在实际上为我工作。
    敌后的交通战，主要是民兵和群众来担任的。一九四○年秋，在我军发动的有名的“百团大战”中，仅冀中一个地区就有三十五万群众参加了破路斗争。一九四二年，仅晋西北的民兵就收割了敌人一万多斤电线，毁围墙四十多座，烧桥梁二十多座。一九四三年一月，山东滨海区的民兵武装和人民群众，为了策应沂蒙区的反“扫荡”战，曾在北起九曲店、南迄重兴、西自沙墩、东至郭家湾，绵延二百里的临（沂）诸（城）公路上展开连续四天的万人大破击。在民兵的掩护下，男女老幼拿起铁锹、铲子、锄头，破路、烧桥、毁岗楼、平围墙、割电线。为了坚持长期斗争，各地民兵、自卫队和人民群众还改造了地形。冀中、冀南等平原地区几乎把全部道路都挖成宽八尺、深约丈许的道沟，使敌人的快速部队在这里不能行进，但“道沟”可掩护抗日军民的转移，因此，群众称之为“抗日道沟”。一九四三年，冀南各地进一步把地形加以改造。虽然很熟悉当地地形的人也常为新的地形所迷惑。苏北盐阜一带开展了挖沟打坝运动，使平原地带村村相连，沟沟相通。水网地带则层层封锁，使敌人的汽艇不能行驶。冀中、冀南等地更开展了地道斗争，在地下挖成约高四尺、宽三尺的地道，村和村通，乡和乡通，甚至县和县通，几百里的幅员可以不出地面，自由转移，形成一种地下交通网。地道中有许多隐蔽的出入口，有大小不同的掩体，有许多曲折部，有许多岔路、通气口和简单的防毒设备。在出入口又置有巧妙的掩蔽物，并设陷坑，出入口的左右上下埋设地雷，使进可以攻，退可以守。在太行等山区，民兵也率领群众在山沟里开辟了山连山的地道式的窑洞。这些巨大的工程，都是几十万人或几百万人的创造。
    民兵采取了高度分散的作战方法，来消耗敌人。他们三人一群，五人一伙，漫山漫野，出没无定，随时随地配合正规军和游击队打击敌人，使敌人陷于风声鹤戾草木皆兵的境地。遇见强大的敌人，他们就暂时分散和隐蔽起来，机动灵活地寻找机会打击敌人。大家称这种战斗方式为“麻雀战”。杀伤敌人的更重要的手段是地雷，是步枪和地雷的结合：敌人不踏上地雷就用步枪打，使敌人慌乱，或被逼到雷阵和雷群中。晋察冀抗日根据地的一等民兵英雄李勇和他的小组，曾以枪雷结合的战术，在一次反“扫荡”战中毙伤敌、伪军三百六十四名，炸毁敌人汽车二十五辆。
    一九四三年以后，民兵组织随着减租减息运动的普遍深入而更加扩大，并因进一步受到了战争的锻炼而更加坚强。民兵从日寇手中缴获了更多的武器，武装了自己；以更多的战斗经验丰富了自己。他们不但能够配合军队粉碎敌人的“扫荡”，而且能够主动地攻击敌人，围困敌人，拔除敌人的据点，扩大根据地。他们不仅能够配合军队打击敌人，而且能够在暂时无主力部队的情况下独当一面地坚持战斗。这样就使得军队作战更加机动，大量歼灭敌人的机会更加增多。
    这一时期，各地民兵实行的联防作战，比较前一时期的高度分散的“麻雀战”和各自保卫村庄的斗争形式更加提高了。所谓联防作战，就是根据自然地形和战斗的需要，由数村民兵共同订立联防公约，一村有事，数村增援，合力围击敌人。晋绥根据地岚县的民兵英雄翟白小，联合了许多村的民兵，建立起一条长达八十华里的联防警戒线，密布哨兵，情报灵通。敌伪来犯，便会受到无数民兵四面八方的攻击。一九四四年六月，五百多个敌伪军订出七天的“扫荡”计划，大举进犯，被这联合作战的民兵打得昏头昏脑，刚刚“扫荡”两天，便狼狈回窜。像这样的或者比这更坚强的联防组织，在当时的抗日根据地里是很多的。
    在这一时期内，解放区腹心地区的民兵为了支持边沿地区民兵的斗争，组成了临时脱离生产的“轮战队”、“武工队”等，轮番不断地开赴接敌边沿地区，配合当地民兵主动地向敌人展开军事的或政治的攻势，围困敌人据点，使敌人不敢走出据点一步；或是配合正规军拔除敌人据点，扩大根据地。据一九四三年不完全的统计，民兵配合军队或单独围困的敌人据点，在晋绥军区八分区有芝兰、岔口等据点；在太行山区有武乡县蟠龙镇等据点；太岳山区有沁源、阎寨等据点；在北岳区有西南升等据点；在淮北有徐州东南的叶坊、长圩子等据点；在鲁中南有白山、垛庄等据点。
    民兵的地雷战，也由爆炸防御转到爆炸进攻。民兵们说：“我们的地雷要会走路，跑到敌人据点附近去爆炸。”
    一九四四年，太岳区民兵围困沁源城的斗争中，曾以五千颗地雷布置了许多雷阵、雷群、雷网，使敌人不敢出城一步，使敌人九百四十条性命丧失在地雷爆炸声中，最后弃城而逃。
    民兵采用各种方法打击敌人的结果，创造了可观的战绩。仅以一九四三年的材料统计，山东军区的民兵一年中作战八千八百五十二次，毙伤俘敌伪六千八百○九名；北岳区的某一个分区的民兵，一年中作战三百九十六次，毙伤俘敌伪三百八十名，其中炸死敌酋井手大佐一名；太行区民兵一年内作战一万五千三百四十九次，毙伤俘敌伪一千一百三十二名；晋西北民兵在一九四三年半年中（四月至九月）作战一千二百○八次，毙伤俘敌伪六百六十五名。此外，冀中、冀鲁豫、冀南、太岳、华中、华南等地区的民兵也获得巨大战果。大体估计，一九四三年一年内各解放区民兵毙伤俘日伪当不下五万人。
    一九四五年八月，苏联出兵东北，迅速消灭了日本侵华精锐关东军一百万，日本当局被迫宣布无条件投降。但是，由于国民党蒋介石反动集团在美帝国主义指使下，勾结日伪，唆使日伪军拒绝向我解放区军民缴械，因此，民兵又大规模参军参战，随同人民解放军投入了反攻作战中去。民兵一方面配合正规军收复失地，一方面还要还击来自背后的国民党匪军的攻击。百战百胜的人民解放军和久经锻炼的民兵，终于打败了敌人，获得了胜利。
    在反攻作战中，民兵在“轮战队”、“武工队”的基础上，整连整营甚至整团地涌上反攻的战场。他们担负救护伤员，看押俘虏，封锁要隘，构筑工事，战场警戒，佯攻，牵制，围困等战斗任务，配合正规军收复敌人的外围据点，直逼交通要道和各大城市。
    太行山区的民兵，在几个月的反攻作战中，参战人数达四十五万之众（包括自卫队）。他们除配合军队收复了临城、襄垣、峰峰、观台等城镇以外，还单独作战六百六十六次，毙伤俘日伪军一千四百六十七名。太岳山区的民兵，在两个月的反攻作战中，整营整团参战的民兵远征队即达一万五千人以上（自卫队及零散参战的民兵不在内）。除配合正规军收复了平陆、夏县等许多城镇外，并单独获得很大战绩。仅十个县的统计，即毙伤俘敌伪正、副师长以下官兵约两千人。
    总之，在抗日战争中，民兵和人民自卫队自始至终和军队一起站在抗日战争的前线，对于最后打败日本侵略者起了重大作用。毛主席说：“这个军队（按指人民解放军）之所以有力量，还由于有人民自卫军与民兵这样广大的群众武装组织，和它一道配合作战。在中国解放区，一切青年，壮年，甚至老年的男人与女人，都在自愿的民主的与不脱离生产的原则下，组织在抗日人民自卫军之中。自卫军中的精干分子，除加入军队及游击队者外，则组织在民兵之中。没有这些群众武装力量的配合，要战胜日本侵略者是不可能的。”（一九四五年四月二十四日“论联合政府”）
    第三次国内革命战争时期中的民兵
    在第三次国内革命战争时期，民兵创造了比抗日战争时期更加光辉的史迹。
    解放区轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，和蒋管区的暗无天日的惨象以及蒋匪军向解放区的疯狂进攻形成尖锐的对比，这激发了广大人民和民兵对敌的高度仇恨和战斗精神。广大的民兵在参战中显示了不可战胜的英雄气概。
    第三次国内革命战争的初期，由于蒋匪军的疯狂进攻和人民解放军集中兵力执行运动歼灭战的方针，民兵和自卫队作战的主要任务之一，仍是开展游击战争，配合人民解放军保卫解放区。但是，这时他们已经不但可以分散作战，消耗敌人，而且可以比较集中地作战、成批地歼灭敌人。在太岳山区一个不大的地区里，在一九四六年七月至一九四七年六月的一年中，民兵即毙伤俘匪军达一万一千人以上。
    民兵对于固守据点的蒋匪军，展开了更大规模的爆炸攻势和更加有力的封锁围困。太行山区和太岳山区的民兵，在战术上创造了“爆炸联防”、“飞行爆炸”、“封锁围困”、“雷阵”、“雷网”、“陷马坑”等，使蒋匪军处于草木皆兵、乱石皆雷的困境。
    民兵对付由据点内出扰我方村庄的敌人的方法，是让他们“好进难出”。联防战斗更加坚强了。一九四七年十二月九日，驻安阳（今平原省属）城的匪军四个营，分六路向我腹地进攻。进至岗西一带，即陷入我当地民兵的雷阵之中。匪军顿时大乱，狼狈回窜。而预先布置好的民兵，这时又从四面八方打来。匪军虽然退了出去，但伤亡达五十一人。
    民兵在无主力军队配合的时候，歼灭小股的敌人，拔除据点，在第三次国内革命战争中，已经不是少见的事情了。太行山区修武县（今平原省属）刘怀松所领导的民兵，曾化装匪军深入敌区，一枪未发即全部俘掳了在匪军一排掩护下的卫生队人员四十四名。汤阴民兵在少数游击队配合之下，一个半小时歼灭了上庄据点的匪军一个小队，毙敌五名，俘敌十一名。太岳山区平陆民兵于黄河水面击沉敌船，歼灭伪县政府武装七十余人。山西介休县民兵英雄张锡满战斗队在仙台战斗中，一次歼敌一个连
    （一百一十人），俘获全部人枪。
    以上是几种主要的战斗方法。此外，民兵还以
    “掏心战”、“鹰抓兔”、“恐吓战”等战术，到处捕捉敌伪零散人员或重要官员，造成敌人的极端恐怖状态。
    一九四七年七月我军开始了战略反攻。在反攻中，民兵更大规模地投入了战斗。
    参战的民兵，已经不是分散的小型组织，而是有了和军队组织大体相同的编制，从连到团都有指挥机构。这种民兵队伍有的叫作“子弟兵团”，有的叫作“基干团”或“野战民兵团”。像这样的民兵团，山东曾有五十个，太岳山区有三十六个，太行山、吕梁山以及各个解放区，都有十几个或几十个团。他们轮番出动，配合人民解放军参加各个较大的战役。
    自卫队的参战组织更为庞大，往往是几万或几十万人参加支援前线的工作。他们也有着小队、分队、中队甚至大队、总队的编制及指挥机关。在统一指挥之下，他们担负转运弹药粮食，抢救、抬运伤员以及帮助战士构筑工事等各种战争勤务。他们往往是自报奋勇，争相参加战勤，因此在完成各项任务时，都表现了高度的自觉性与高度的组织性和纪律性。
    这一支人民群众大军，在人民解放军反攻作战的每一个战场和各个较大的战役中，如东北的辽沈战役、锦州战役，华东的济南战役、淮海战役、京沪战役中，都成为不可缺少的重要力量。他们不仅参加本区范围内的许多大小战役，而且作数千里的远距离参战，时间有的长达一年。如山东民兵所组成的子弟兵团曾随军参战到达福建；山西民兵所组成的“野战团”或“基干团”，曾经西至甘肃凉州，北至绥远、内蒙，南至黄河以南伏牛山区；河北民兵的远征部队曾北至察北地区，南至黄河南岸；陕西陇东的民兵曾配合人民解放军远征宁夏、甘肃、四川各地。其参战规模之大、时间之长、距离之远，为空前未有。他们不仅担负着运送粮弹、抢修铁路、掩护交通、抢救伤员等战争勤务，而且也担负着解送战俘、捕捉散匪、战场警戒等战斗任务，积极帮助部队歼灭敌人。
    在反攻作战中，民兵除了大批远征参战之外，由于主力部队开赴反攻前线，后方主力部队较少，留在后方的民兵和自卫队，还担负了包围、封锁敌人的孤立据点，镇压残匪和特务等巩固后方的重大任务。
    在第三次国内革命战争时期，民兵自卫队还有一个特殊的贡献，就是大批地参加人民解放军。很多地区的民兵，在战争胜利的鼓舞之下，常常和他们的指挥员一起，大批集体入伍。民兵入伍后，只需经过短期的训练，就可以开赴前线作战，并在战斗中，在老战士的积极帮助之下，迅速地提高了战斗力。
    中华人民共和国成立以来的民兵
    中华人民共和国诞生以来，民兵制度已规定成为中华人民共和国的军事制度之一。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第二十三条规定：“中华人民共和国实行民兵制度，保卫地方秩序，建立国家动员基础，并准备在适当时机实行义务兵役制。”这就给民兵提出了新的任务和新的发展方向。
    三年以来，民兵已在全国日益普遍地建立起来。在中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会的领导之下，建立了统一的组织，统一的制度，并在土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、爱国丰产等群众运动中，飞速发展成为××万的大军了（自卫队未统计在内）。他们以主人翁的姿态，协同人民解放军和地方公安部队，担负起剿灭残匪、保卫海防、边防、保卫土地改革的进行、保卫生产建设、镇压反革命活动等光荣的任务，成为维护革命秩序、巩固人民民主专政的重要力量之一。
    美国帝国主义发动侵朝战争并霸占我国领土台湾以来，不断侵犯我祖国的领海、领空，全国人民为美帝国主义的侵略行为所激愤，掀起了伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国运动。处在国防最前线的东北民兵，一方面志愿组织抗美援朝担架队、运输队等开赴朝鲜前线，配合中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军作战，打击美国侵略者；另一方面又加强戒备，日夜守卫着江防及祖国的边疆，准备打击任何敢于侵犯我们祖国边境的侵略者。其他各地的民兵，也在抗美援朝运动中，成千成万地参加了中国人民志愿军。留在后方的民兵也加倍地巩固了后方的治安。
    现在，民兵组织正在继续发展，在实现普遍民兵制度之后，民兵将有更大的发展。同时他们正严密注视着美帝国主义的侵略行动，积极加强训练，准备随时响应祖国的号召。
    中国人民有了强大的中国人民解放军，又有了作为人民解放军的强大的助手和后备军的群众武装，任何帝国主义的侵略阴谋将必然遭到可耻的失败。
