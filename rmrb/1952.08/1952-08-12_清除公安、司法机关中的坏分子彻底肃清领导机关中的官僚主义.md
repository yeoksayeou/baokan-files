Column: Brief Commentary on Political and Legal Work

    The "Songzailing Incident" in Enping County, Guangdong Province, has exposed serious impurities existing in some of our public security and judicial organs. The public security and judicial organs of Enping County have virtually become tools for the landlord class to suppress the peasants. Important positions in these departments were controlled by opportunists and counter-revolutionaries. These bad elements infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and engaged in activities entirely in accordance with the landlord-tyrant's poisonous plan to murder peasants. They mixed into the revolutionary ranks to continue their counter-revolutionary activities, causing irreparable losses to the people and seriously damaging the prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the masses.

    The "Songzailing Incident" tells us that the enemies of the people will never be reconciled to their demise; they will not only harm us from the outside, but also try every possible means to use the destructive elements hidden within the revolutionary ranks to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. We must accept the painful lessons of the "Songzailing Incident," quickly and thoroughly rectify our important tools of the people's democratic dictatorship—the public security and judicial organs—and resolutely eliminate all internal traitors and opportunists. Without doing so, the regime of the people's democratic dictatorship cannot be consolidated.

    This tragic incident also fully exposes the serious bureaucratic style of work existing in some of our leading organs. The public security and judicial organs of Enping County had already become corrupt and deteriorated, but its superior leading organs knew nothing about it. The public security organs of Enping County had never solved a single bandit-spy case, which also failed to arouse the attention and vigilance of the superior organs. In the "Songzailing Incident," the county people's court made a murderous judgment against the peasants He Zhaoting and others based on fabricated facts and evidence, while Xie Chuang, the commissioner and president of the Yuezhong People's Court, casually approved "agreement" when reviewing such a major case without even studying the case. Does the duty of a provincial people's court only extend to forwarding cases to the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court for review? With such a seriously irresponsible bureaucratic and red-tape style of work in the higher-level organs, the scheming destructive elements in the lower-level organizations can naturally murder revolutionary people smoothly and without obstruction! Therefore, while rectifying organizational structures, we must thoroughly examine and liquidate the bureaucratic style of work in the leading organs, and establish a revolutionary style of work that is conscientious and responsible, pays attention to investigation and research, and maintains contact with the masses.

### 清除公安、司法机关中的坏分子彻底肃清领导机关中的官僚主义

    清除公安、司法机关中的坏分子彻底肃清领导机关中的官僚主义
    广东省恩平县“松仔岭事件”，暴露出我们某些公安、司法机构存在着严重的不纯现象。恩平县的公安、司法机关，实际上已经成了地主阶级镇压农民的工具。这些部门的重要职务被投机分子和反革命分子所掌握。这些坏分子钻入革命阵营，完全按照地主恶霸谋杀农民的毒计，从事活动。他们混入革命队伍，继续进行反革命活动，给人民造成不可挽回的损失，极严重地损害了党和人民政府在群众中的威信。
    “松仔岭事件”告诉我们：人民的敌人决不会甘心于自己的死亡；他们不仅要从外部来危害我们，而且千方百计地利用潜藏在革命阵营内部的破坏分子进行反革命的破坏活动。我们必须接受“松仔岭事件”的惨痛教训，迅速地、彻底地整顿我们人民民主专政的重要工具——公安、司法机关，坚决把一切内奸分子和投机分子清除出去。不如此，人民民主专政的政权就不能巩固。
    这一惨痛事件也充分暴露了我们某些领导机关存在着严重的官僚主义作风。恩平县的公安、司法机关早已腐烂变质，但是它的上级领导机关竟一无所闻。恩平县的公安机关从未破获一件土匪特务案件，也全然没有引起上级机关的注意和警惕。在“松仔岭事件”中，县人民法院根据捏造的事实和证据对农民何兆廷等作了谋杀性的判决，而粤中人民法院复核时，专员兼法院院长谢创对这样的重大案件，竟不研究案情，就轻率地批了“同意”。广东省人民法院则简单地照转最高人民法院中南分院复核，难道一个省人民法院的职务只限于照转案件吗？上级机关存在着这种严重不负责任的官僚主义和文牍主义的工作作风，下层机构中的阴谋破坏分子自然可以顺利无阻地谋害革命人民了！因此，在整顿组织机构的同时，必须彻底检查和清算领导机关中的官僚主义作风，树立认真负责、注意调查研究和联系群众的革命工作作风。
