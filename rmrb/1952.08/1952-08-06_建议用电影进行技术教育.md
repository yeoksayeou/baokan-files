    Suggestion to Use Films for Technical Education

    Comrade Editor: The motherland's large-scale economic construction is about to begin, requiring a large number of skilled workers and technical cadres. However, at present, our country has few technical schools, few teachers, and insufficient equipment. To train a large number of skilled workers and technicians in a short period of time, we must adopt various revolutionary methods. To cultivate a large number of technicians among the working masses, we must use effective methods to break the conservative thinking of some workers and enable them to accept and create advanced production methods.

    In the past, when I was studying technical theory and practicing, I watched several technical education films, which greatly helped my learning at the time. Because it uses practical images to explain principles in a simple and easy-to-understand way, and uses practical actions to illustrate work methods, it is easier to understand and more vivid and interesting than reading books or listening to professors in class. Moreover, it is especially convenient for factories, schools, farms, hospitals, etc. with large numbers of people. Therefore, I suggest that our country's film studios, the Academy of Sciences, schools, factories, farms, hospitals, and other units closely cooperate to produce a large number of educational films with technical theories, design methods, operation methods, manufacturing methods, repair methods, basic operation methods, and management methods as the subject matter. These films should be specifically for factories, mines, farms, schools, etc. to train technical personnel. Huang Fuxin

    建议用电影进行技术教育
    编辑同志：祖国大规模的经济建设即将开始，需要大量技术工人和技术干部。但目前我国的技术学校少，师资少，各种设备不够多，要在短期内训练出大量技术工人和技术员就必须采用各种革命的方法。要在工人群众中大量培养技术员，要用有效方法打破某些工人的保守思想，使他们接受和创造先进生产方法。
    我过去学习技术理论和实习时，看过几部技术教育的电影片，对我当时的学习帮助很大。因为它用实际的形象，深入浅出地说明原理，用实际的动作说明工作的方法，比看书本或在课堂上听教授讲解更觉容易明白和生动有趣。而且对于人数众多的工厂、学校、农场、医院等，应用起来尤为方便。所以我建议我们国家的电影制片厂和科学院、学校、工厂、农场、医院等密切联系，大量拍制以技术理论、设计方法、操作方法、制造方法、修理方法、基本作业方法、管理方法等，作为题材的教育片子。专供厂矿、农场、学校等培养技术人材之用。    黄孚新
