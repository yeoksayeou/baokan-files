Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Sydney dispatch: The Australian people are enthusiastically supporting the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and are actively preparing to participate in the conference.

The Most Reverend Dr. Booth, the Archbishop of Melbourne, Rev. Dr. Ball of the Church of Scotland, Rev. Dr. Benson of the Wesleyan Church, and Rev. Dickson of the Independent Congregational Church, all prominent religious figures in Melbourne, recently issued a statement supporting the proposal to send an Australian delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The University of Sydney has established a "Students for Beijing Committee" to select a student representative to attend the conference. In addition, Mullin, secretary of the South Coast Labour Council of Australia, recently announced that the council had decided to hold a special meeting of the Labour Council and the various branches of the metal industry to select South Coast representatives to attend the meeting in Beijing.

Bolton, the chief representative of Australia to the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and Australian peace activists are promoting the importance of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in various places. On the evening of July 18, Bolton and Dr. Wood, a leader of the Methodist Church, delivered speeches in Melbourne. The meeting hall was filled with 2,000 people, and many more stood in the street listening. Lambourn, a spokesman for the Australian Pacific Peace Committee, has spoken at many union rallies, calling for the defense of peace in the Pacific. He said that he had met many people who supported the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference at rallies of miners, dockworkers, boilermakers, steelworkers, and construction workers.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Bangkok dispatch: Thailand's people's peace movement organizations are uniting the broad masses of the people and actively preparing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The Thai Peace Committee has recommended Dr. Nai Charoon Sukhsang, chairman of the committee, to participate in the Thai Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. According to the "Cao Thai Daily" in Bangkok, Nai Charoon Sukhsang wrote to various Thai newspapers after the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, saying that the Thai Peace Committee had decided to hold a meeting in Bangkok in August to discuss the selection of Thai representatives to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the proposals to be put forward at the peace conference, and other issues. Representatives from various fields and organizations will be invited to participate in the meeting to hear opinions from all sides.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: North Vietnamese dispatch: Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam Lien Viet Front, and Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, recently jointly issued a letter to all Vietnamese people, calling on all Vietnamese people to respond to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference scheduled to be held in Beijing in September.

The letter to all Vietnamese people first pointed out that peace in the Asian and Pacific regions is being severely threatened due to the frantic pursuit of a policy of aggressive war by the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States. The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference at this time is very timely.

The letter to all Vietnamese people said that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has made a great contribution to the movement for national independence and world peace. We, the Vietnamese people, warmly welcome this conference. The National Committee of the Vietnam Lien Viet Front and the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace have established domestic preparatory committees to carry out preparatory work, send representatives to participate in the work of the preparatory committee in Beijing, and begin selecting representatives to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

The letter to all Vietnamese people then issued a call to all Vietnamese people, saying that all people's organizations in the Vietnam Lien Viet Front and all Vietnamese peace fighters must widely and deeply publicize the great significance of this conference among the people. The Vietnamese military and civilians must redouble their enthusiasm for patriotic competition, resolutely eliminate more of the enemy's active forces, develop guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, oppose the enemy's plots of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," and achieve the 1952 patriotic production increase and thrift plan. Discussions should be launched in villages, institutions, schools, enterprises, and military units in enemy-occupied and liberated areas, and resolutions should be made to oppose the use of bacteriological weapons by American imperialism in Korea and Northeast China, and at the same time, continue to collect signatures on the declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact. All organs of public opinion, all people's organizations, as well as religious circles, cultural circles, literary and art circles, and all people who love independence, freedom, and peace, should enthusiastically support the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

The letter to all Vietnamese people concluded by saying: "We are deeply convinced that the peace forces of the Asian and Pacific regions, combined with the peace forces of the world, will smash the war plans of the imperialist bloc and its running dogs. Due to the long-term determination of the Vietnamese people under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh to resist, and the close unity of the peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, we will certainly be able to eliminate the French colonial aggressors and defeat the American imperialist interventionists, obtain the complete independence of the three nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and contribute to the defense of world peace."

    告全国人民书说：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议对于争取国家独立和世界和平的运动有巨大的贡献。我们越南人民热烈地欢迎这个会议。越南国民联合战线全国委员会和越南保卫世界和平委员会已成立了国内的筹备委员会去进行筹备工作，派出代表参加在北京的筹备委员会工作，并开始选出代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    告全国人民书接着向越南全国人民发出号召说：在越南国民联合战线中的各人民团体和越南的所有和平战士，都要把这次会议的重大意义，广泛而深入地在人民群众中宣传。越南军民要加倍振奋地进行爱国竞赛，决心消灭更多敌人的有生力量，发展敌后游击战，反对敌人的“以战养战”和“利用越南人打越南人”的阴谋，实现一九五二年爱国增产节约计划。在敌占区和解放区的各村庄、机关、学校、企业及各军事单位要展开讨论，并做出决议，反对美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器，同时并继续征集在要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言上的签名。各舆论机关，各人民团体，以及宗教界，文化界，文艺界和所有爱好独立、自由、和平的人士，要热情支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
