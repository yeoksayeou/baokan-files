Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Following their disastrous defeat in the Hoa Binh campaign, the French invading forces in Vietnam are intensifying their policy of destroying peaceful Vietnamese villages and savagely massacring the Vietnamese people.

According to the Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnamese Labor Party's central organ newspaper, "People's Weekly," recently published an article accusing the French aggressors of sabotaging dikes, water conservancy projects, and other criminal acts in the Vietnamese countryside. The article stated: For several years, the French colonialists have consistently attempted to create famine in Vietnam by destroying sluice gates and water conservancy facilities. After suffering defeats in Hoa Binh province, the French army's atrocities have become even more frenzied. Between April and May, French military aircraft successively bombed reservoirs in the central Vietnamese provinces of Nghe An and Ha Tinh, and the Bai Thuong River sluice gate in Thanh Hoa province. From June 11th to 12th, sixteen French military aircraft frantically bombed water conservancy projects in the areas of Bon Thich and Phong Liao in northern central Vietnam. Another group of French military aircraft frantically bombed the Lien Son sluice gate in Vinh Phuc province and a sluice gate called "Khuong," located five kilometers south of Thai Nguyen city, on June 12th. When Vietnamese farmers attempted to repair these peaceful water conservancy facilities, French military aircraft also frantically opened fire.

When the French invading forces "mopped up" the countryside, they used extremely barbaric methods and massacred large numbers of Vietnamese people. In March, the French army buried twenty-three Vietnamese elders alive in one instance in Ha Nam province. In April, the French army leveled several prosperous villages while conducting "mopping up" operations in Thai Binh province. In Hai Duong province, the French army recently held a shooting competition targeting Vietnamese women working in the fields. In Quang Ngai province, when the French army went to the countryside to loot grain, they captured women, drove them to the riverbank, snatched the children from their arms and threw them into the river, and used the children floating in the river and the mothers going into the river to rescue their children as shooting targets.

In the cities occupied by the French army, the French colonialists are intensifying the implementation of fascist terror policies. The French colonialists have established concentration camps in cities such as Ninh Binh, Bac Ninh, and Dong Trieu, imprisoning thousands of unarmed Vietnamese civilians, including the elderly, children, and women. The French army forces them to bask in the sun when the weather is hot and to be drenched in the rain when the weather is cold. Hundreds of prisoners have already been tortured to death in the concentration camps.

    侵越法军的野蛮暴行
    【新华社十九日讯】侵越法军在和平城战役遭受惨败后，正变本加厉地施行破坏越南和平农村和野蛮地屠杀越南人民的恐怖政策。
    据越南通讯社讯：越南劳动党中央机关报“人民”周刊最近一期发表一篇论文，控诉法国侵略者在越南农村破坏堤坝、水利工程等罪恶行为。论文说：几年来法国殖民者一贯以破坏水闸和水利设施的行动企图在越南制造灾荒。在和平省遭受失败后，法军的这种暴行已越发疯狂。在四月到五月间，法军飞机接连地炸毁了中越义安、河静两省的蓄水池和清化省拜赏河的水闸。六月十一日到十二日，十六架法军飞机在中越北方本适和访寮一带轰炸水利工程。另一批法军飞机在六月十二日疯狂轰炸永福省连山的水闸和距太原城南五公里的一个名叫“况”的水闸。当越南农民抢修这些和平的水利设施时，法军飞机还疯狂地开火扫射。
    侵越法军在下乡“扫荡”时，使用十分野蛮的手段，大量屠杀越南人民。三月间，法军在河南省一次就活埋了二十三个越南老人。四月间，法军在太平省进行“扫荡”时，夷平了几个繁荣的村庄。在海阳省，法军最近举行了一个以在田间劳动的越南妇女为目标的射击竞赛。在广仁省，法军在下乡抢掠粮食时，捕捉妇女，赶她们到河边，把她们怀里的孩子夺过去摔到河里，并把在河中漂浮的孩子和下河抢救儿女的母亲作为射击的标的。
    在法军占领下的城市，法国殖民者正加紧实施法西斯的恐怖政策。法国殖民者在宁平、北宁和东潮等城市设立了集中营，囚禁数千名手无寸铁的越南平民，其中包括老人、儿童和妇女。法军在天气热的时候赶他们去晒太阳，在天气寒冷时赶他们去淋雨。数以百计的被囚者已在集中营里被折磨致死。
