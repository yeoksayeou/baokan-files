    Yangquan Coal Mine No. 4 Should Emphasize and Improve Employee Health Work

    To the Editor: The leading cadres of Yangquan Coal Mine No. 4 do not pay enough attention to health work. The mine's health clinic is less than ten meters away from the toilet and less than five meters away from the staff dormitory and kitchen, but they do not pay attention to improving the sanitation of the toilet and kitchen. The toilet lacks proper facilities. Hundreds of patients visit the clinic every day and gather there, breathing foul air. The food prepared in the workers' dining hall is very poor. On the 20th, the steamed buns for the 22nd and 23rd are already made, left cold on the table, and covered with flies. People have repeatedly raised concerns with the leading cadres and the administrative head, but they ignore them. The administrative head not only fails to educate the cooks and find ways to improve the food service, but also joins the cooks in taking a confrontational stance, saying, "It won't work if we don't do it this way, otherwise we can't do it."

    The above issues have been raised repeatedly, but they have not been resolved. I suggest that the leading cadres of the Fourth Mine should quickly organize health workers to conduct appropriate inspections and deal with unhygienic conditions.

    阳泉煤矿第四矿应重视和改进职工卫生工作
    编辑同志：阳泉煤矿第四矿的领导干部，对卫生工作极不重视。该矿卫生所距离厕所不足十公尺，距离职员宿舍和厨房不足五公尺，但并不注意改善厕所和厨房的卫生工作。厕所没有完善设备，每天成百的病人在卫生所看病时，就群集在那里呼吸着很臭的空气。工人食堂做的饭很坏，二十号就把二十二、三号的馒头做好了，冷着放在桌上，让苍蝇去爬。有人给领导干部和事务长再三提出意见，他们也不理睬。事务长不但不去教育炊事员，设法改善膳食工作，反而同炊事员一起采取对抗态度说：“不这样做就不行，不然我们是不能干。”
    以上这些问题，大家也三番五次的提过意见，但始终不能解决。我建议四矿领导干部，应迅速组织卫生工作人员，对不合卫生条件的现象做适当的检查和处理。    零一
