Judicial Reform Begins in the Entire Northeast Region
Beijing Judicial Reform Committee Established and Plan Formulated

[This newspaper reported] Judicial reform has begun in the entire Northeast region. On July 9th, the Northeast Region held its Third Judicial Work Conference to discuss and deploy judicial reform work. Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, delivered an important report at the meeting. Gao Chongmin, Minister of Justice of the Northeast People's Government, concurrently called on judicial departments at all levels in the Northeast to resolutely implement the central government's policy on judicial reform work. Song Guangchang, Deputy Minister of Justice of the Northeast People's Government, proposed reform steps and plans based on the existing problems in Northeast judicial work. On July 28th, the Northeast People's Government also issued the "Instructions on Launching the Judicial Reform Movement to Purify People's Courts at All Levels," requiring people's courts in each province and city to first carry out the reform work of their own organs, and at the same time select one or two county and city people's courts to conduct key experiments, learn from experience, and promote overall progress. The instructions also pointed out that it is necessary to mobilize the masses and litigants to report and expose problems; conduct in-depth work inspections; systematically collect materials; earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism; and oppose simplistic and hasty work styles.

According to the deployment of the regional judicial work conference and the instructions of the Northeast People's Government, the people's judicial organs in the Northeast Region and various provinces and cities successively and systematically began judicial reform work from late July to early August. As of August 4th, the key inspection work of the Northeast Branch of the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice of the Northeast People's Government had been basically completed, and it is now entering the stage of comprehensively and systematically criticizing old legal viewpoints and old judicial work styles. In this stage, it is stipulated that leading cadres should take the lead in conducting self-examination to promote criticism and self-criticism among all staff. On August 5th, Shenyang City convened a meeting of all staff members of the city and district people's courts to make a mobilization report on judicial reform, and then conducted deliberation in connection with the mobilization report and study documents. Most people exposed some problems and expressed their determination to transform themselves; however, a few people lacked understanding of judicial reform work, refused to expose their true thoughts, and only labeled themselves with the empty title of "unstable position," or said: "I have too many old legal viewpoints, how can I check them?" Some still have the ideas of "waiting to be purged" and "waiting to be transferred." After four days of study and attitude checks, these incorrect thoughts and attitudes were basically reversed, and the transition to universal inspection began on the 11th. According to the city's proposed judicial reform work plan, symposiums of litigants will be held in districts later to widely solicit opinions from the masses; key inspection teams will be organized to clarify key people and key events, and select typical examples for public criticism; finally, the leadership will make correct conclusions and conduct organizational handling through the masses. The People's Courts of Rehe Province and Chengde City also began studying documents and preliminarily reviewed their work in early August. The People's Court of Rehe Province has now sent letters to county party committees, county people's governments, public security bureaus, and provincial-level organs, requesting assistance in widely collecting opinions from the people. The People's Courts of Rehe Province and Chengde City have established inspection teams and begun to inspect the cases they have handled in the past.

[This newspaper reported] The judicial reform movement is underway in Beijing. Since the establishment of the Beijing People's Court, although it has made great achievements in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship system and implementing the various policies of the People's Government, the "Three-Anti" movement has exposed the serious impurity in the organization and ideology of the city and district-level people's courts. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, the Beijing People's Court had a total of seventy-four judges, of whom forty-seven were old judicial personnel. Only a few of these old judicial personnel have been educated and reformed since liberation. In general, their positions are unstable, and they have serious old legal viewpoints. Some cannot distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and some even stand on the anti-people's position. Therefore, various illegal and undisciplined incidents have occurred. For example, the old judicial personnel Zhang Kaiming dared to privately set up a "fortune-telling office" at home, colluding with black lawyers to solicit lawsuits. Old judicial personnel Gao Shangzhi often exonerated landlords, suppressed farmers' accusations against landlords, and openly opposed on-site trials, believing that this was "selling wild medicine, which is indecent!" Some old judicial personnel wrote petitions and gave ideas to the parties in the cases they handled, thereby extorting money. Others said to the defendant when sentencing a criminal case: "I originally sentenced you to two years, but the president changed it to five years." And he showed the defendant the draft of the verdict to ingratiate himself with the defendant. Even worse, they used despicable means of threatening and enticing female parties in handling cases. The Beijing People's Court has dealt with these illegal and undisciplined phenomena in a timely manner. Some bad elements who seriously violated the law have been arrested and brought to justice. Although illegal and undisciplined incidents have been significantly reduced after the "Three-Anti" movement, the old legal viewpoints still seriously exist in the Beijing People's Court. Some old cadres who have studied old laws in the past, although they have participated in the revolution for many years, have not cleared their old legal viewpoints; some old cadres and newly joined cadres have unknowingly become prisoners of the old law, thus bringing undue losses to the work. Therefore, it is very necessary and timely for Beijing to carry out judicial reform.

The Beijing Municipal People's Government has now approved the Beijing Judicial Reform Plan, deciding to focus on the ideological transformation of anti-old legal viewpoints, and pointed out that ideological transformation, organizational rectification, system establishment, and work style transformation should be combined. This judicial reform movement is expected to last one and a half months. At the beginning, leading cadres of the Municipal People's Court and presidents of the District Courts will concentrate on checking and reviewing in the Municipal People's Court, and other cadres will also participate in making suggestions, collecting and providing materials; then all cadres will start learning, carry out criticism and self-criticism, check and review old legal viewpoints and wrong behaviors; finally, summarize the experience of learning and propose improvement methods.

The Beijing Judicial Reform Committee has been officially established, with Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu serving as the director, and Deputy Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Feng Jiping, President of the Municipal People's Court Wang Feiran, and Vice President He Shenggao serving as deputy directors. The Beijing Judicial Reform Committee also plans to widely solicit opinions and materials on judicial reform from the citizens through district people's representative conferences and other means.

    东北全区开始进行司法改革
    北京市司法改革委员会成立并订出计划
    【本报讯】东北全区开始进行司法改革。七月九日，东北区曾举行第三届司法工作会议，讨论和布置了司法改革工作。东北人民政府副主席林枫在会上作了重要报告。东北人民政府司法部兼部长高崇民号召东北各级司法部门坚决贯彻中央关于司法改革工作的方针。东北人民政府司法部副部长宋广常根据东北司法工作目前存在的问题，提出了改革的步骤和方案。七月二十八日，东北人民政府并发布了“关于开展司法改革运动纯洁各级人民法院的指示”，要求各省、市人民法院首先做好本机关的改革工作，同时选择一、二个县、市人民法院进行重点试验，吸取经验，推动全面。指示并指出：必须发动群众和诉讼当事人进行检举揭发；深入检查工作；系统地收集材料；认真开展批评和自我批评；反对简单化和草率粗糙的作风。
    东北区和各省、市人民司法机关根据全区司法工作会议的布置和东北人民政府的指示，在七月下旬到八月初旬，先后有计划地开始了司法改革工作。截至八月四日，最高人民法院东北分院和东北人民政府司法部的重点检查工作已基本完成，现正转入全面地和系统地批判旧法观点和旧司法作风的阶段。在这一阶段中，规定由领导干部带头进行自我检查，以推动全体工作人员进行批评和自我批评。沈阳市在八月五日召开了市、区人民法院全体工作人员会议，作了司法改革的动员报告，随后即联系动员报告和学习文件进行酝酿。大多数人都暴露了一些问题，表示决心改造自己；但也有少数人对司法改革工作缺乏认识，不肯暴露真实的思想，只给自己扣上个“立场不稳”的空帽子，或者说：“我的旧法观点太多啦，怎样检查？”有的还存在着
    “等清洗”、“等转业”的想法。经过四天的学习和检查态度以后，基本上扭转了这些不正确的思想和态度，从十一日开始转入了普遍的检查。根据该市拟定的司法改革工作计划，以后将分区召开诉讼当事人座谈会，广泛征求群众意见；组织重点检查组，搞清重点人和重点事件，并选出其中的典型进行大会批判；最后由领导方面做出正确结论，通过群众进行组织处理。热河省和承德市人民法院也在八月初旬开始学习文件，并初步检讨了工作。热河省人民法院现已函请各县县委、县人民政府、公安局和省直属机关协助广泛收集人民群众的意见。热河省和承德市人民法院已成立了检查小组，开始检查过去所处理的案件。
    【本报讯】北京市开展司法改革运动。北京市人民法院成立以来，虽在巩固人民民主专政制度和贯彻人民政府各项政策方面有很大成绩，但在“三反”运动中，暴露了市、区级人民法院在组织上和思想作风上还存有严重不纯的现象。“三反”运动以前，北京市人民法院共有审判人员七十四人，其中有旧司法人员四十七人。这些旧司法人员在解放以后只有少数得到教育改造，一般地都是立场不稳，并存有严重的旧法观点。有的敌我不分，有的甚至根本站在反人民立场。因此，就造成了各种违法乱纪事件。例如旧司法人员章开铭，竟敢在家中私设“问事处”，勾结黑律师，包揽词讼。旧司法人员高尚志，经常为地主开脱，压制农民对地主的控诉，并公然反对就地审判，认为这是“卖野药，不成体统！”有的旧司法人员在自己承办的案件中，给当事人写状子，出主意，借此敲诈勒索。还有的旧司法人员在宣判刑事案件时对被告说：“我原判你二年，院长给改成了五年。”并且把判决底稿拿给被告看，向被告买好。更恶劣的，是在办案中对女当事人进行威胁利诱的卑鄙手段。这些违法乱纪现象，北京市人民法院已及时作了处理。其中有些严重违法的坏分子并已逮捕法办。经过“三反”运动以后，违法乱纪事件虽已显著减少，但是旧法观点在北京市人民法院中还是严重地存在着。有些过去学过旧法律的老干部，虽然参加革命多年，但旧法观点并没有得到清算；也有些老干部和新参加工作的干部不知不觉地做了旧法的俘虏，因而给工作带来了不应有的损失。所以北京市进行司法改革是非常必要和适时的。
    北京市人民政府现已批准北京市司法改革计划，决定以反旧法观点的思想改造为重点，并指出要把思想改造、整顿组织、建立制度、改造作风结合起来进行。这次司法改革运动，预计为期一个半月。开始时，市人民法院领导干部和区法院院长将集中在市人民法院带头检查和检讨，其他干部也参加提意见，搜集并提供材料；接着全体干部展开学习，进行批评和自我批评，检查并检讨旧法观点及错误行为；最后再总结学习的经验，提出改进的办法。
    北京市司法改革委员会已正式成立，由张友渔副市长兼任主任，市公安局副局长冯基平，市人民法院院长王斐然，副院长贺生高兼任副主任。北京市司法改革委员会并计划通过区各界人民代表会议及其他方式，广泛向市民群众搜集有关司法改革的意见与材料。
