    A New Type of Ranch
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    Three hours north of Zhangbei County, Chahar Province, by car will bring you to the Chabei Ranch, directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government.
    This is a place of beautiful scenery. The vast grassland is like an endless carpet, dotted with newly built gray-white ranch offices and stables. Groups of brown horses, cattle, and snow-white sheep graze there quietly.
    The Chabei Ranch was established in 1950. The task of this ranch is to breed high-quality draft horses, cattle, and sheep imported from the Soviet Union, and to cultivate new livestock breeds using hybridization methods, and to promote them to North China, Inner Mongolia and other regions.
    This ranch is already taking shape. It has more than 400 employees, 90,000 mu of land (including 60,000 mu of grassland and 30,000 mu of arable land), more than 300 Soviet purebred horses, more than 200 Merino sheep, and more than 50 head of dual-purpose Shorthorn dairy and beef cattle. There are also more than 3,000 Mongolian sheep, more than 100 Mongolian cattle, and more than 100 Mongolian horses used to cultivate new breeds. There is also a branch farm specializing in the production of horse feed. The ranch has established six fine horse breeding stations in Zhangbei, Shangyi and other counties to carry out horse hybridization and promotion among herders, and it has also jointly established seven cattle and sheep breeding stations with the Chahar Provincial People's Government, using advanced breeding methods to promote new breeds.
    In just two years, the Chabei Ranch has achieved considerable results. In 1951, the conception rate of stallions in the ranch was 75.8% (the conception rate of stallions in well-performing horse farms in the past did not exceed 70%), the foaling rate was 90.9%, and the survival rate was 96.6%. The conception rate of ewes was 98.3%, the lambing rate was 145%, and the survival rate was 98.8%. The conception rate, calving rate, and survival rate of cattle were all 100%. The ranch has also achieved certain results in promoting crossbred improved breeds in pastoral areas. In 1951, a total of more than 2,370 civilian horses were bred, with a conception rate of 30%. This year, it is planned to crossbreed 4,320 horses. According to statistics at the end of June this year, the six fine horse breeding stations have overfulfilled their tasks. Now, the scope of crossbreeding is expanding day by day, and herders in Kangbao, Guyuan and other places are also bringing horses to the breeding stations for crossbreeding.
    The Chabei Ranch has adopted advanced Soviet experience in the feeding and management of stallions, cattle, and sheep, from the construction of stables to the feeding, training, artificial insemination, and medical treatment of livestock. This is one of the fastest and most thorough ranches in our country to adopt advanced Soviet experience. This is mainly because the leading cadres of the ranch are determined to accept Soviet experience, and Soviet experts have provided specific guidance and patient assistance to the work of the ranch. Every time a new job is done or an old method is changed, Soviet experts always explain why the new method should be implemented, compare it with the old method, and then personally do it once for the staff to see before letting the staff try it out. In 1951, after the stallions gave birth to foals, there was not enough mare's milk, and many foals had to eat cow's milk. Soviet experts pointed out that the main reason for the lack of mare's milk was improper feeding of pregnant mares. Pregnant mares should not be fed according to the general stallions, but should be appropriately increased in feed. This year, the ranch adopted the suggestions of Soviet experts, and the mare's milk is now sufficient. Recently, a Soviet expert discovered a wild grass called "fragrant wormwood" on a hillside, and he immediately suggested that the ranch send people to collect it. He said that this "fragrant wormwood" contains a large amount of vitamins, which can be used as feed; and it contains "santonin" ingredients, which can deworm sheep. Based on the expert's opinion, the ranch immediately sent people to collect fragrant wormwood.
    In the early days of the ranch's construction, many employees, especially those who had worked in old ranches, had conservative ideas, and they resisted advanced experience. Wang Xixian, a technician, had worked in the Tongliao horse farm run by the Japanese for six years. He was familiar with the Japanese method of feeding and managing horses. He believed that in order to train horses, he must first conquer them by force; the Soviet method of training horses, like coaxing children, was kind and patiently guided, and he believed that this could not train good horses. However, facts have proved that by implementing the Soviet training method, more than 20 adult stallions were trained within a year, which would not have been possible with the old method.
    The conservative ideas of local herders were also very serious at first. This affected the ranch's crossbreeding promotion work. Last year, when the ranch began to use Soviet stallions to mate with civilian horses, many herders said, "Soviet stallions can only be displayed in government agencies, they cannot be used." They were particularly opposed to the method of artificial insemination for horses, believing that it was completely unreliable. In order to solve these conservative ideas among the herders, the Chabei Ranch organized an exhibition and competition at the temple fair in Zhangbei County in May this year. At this competition, Soviet stallions and Mongolian horses raced and competed in pulling carts. At that time, ordinary Soviet stallions and famous Mongolian fast horses raced for 1,200 meters. When the Soviet stallions reached the finish line, the Mongolian horses were 353 meters behind; when competing in pulling carts, pulling 2,500 kilograms of goods and walking 3,000 meters, the Soviet stallions, which did not often pull carts, did not pant at all when they reached the finish line, while the Mongolian horses, which often pulled carts, could only pull 260 meters before they could not pull anymore. The temple fair also exhibited hybrid foals born by artificial insemination, and also demonstrated the method of artificial insemination on the spot. These practical educations have made herders begin to change many wrong views.
    Some herders' horses have been mated with Soviet stallions, and this year they have given birth to foals. These foals are all very good. A herder in Zhangbei Chengguan had a mare that gave birth to a hybrid foal, and the whole family was overjoyed and invited the villagers to visit. The herder stroked the foal's back and said, "What a good foal! It's big, and its body shape and coat color are all good. This foal is much better than its mother!" Li Zhanlin, a herder in Eryanjing, Zhangbei County, had two horses conceived last year, one by artificial insemination and one by natural mating. This year, both horses gave birth to foals, and both foals were equally lively and lovely. Li Zhanlin led the foals around to publicize, so that many herders knew the benefits of Soviet stallions and the benefits of artificial insemination.

### 一个新型的牧场

    一个新型的牧场
    本报记者  朱波
    从察哈尔省张北县乘汽车北行三小时，就可到达中央人民政府农业部直接领导的察北牧场。
    这是一个景色秀丽的地方。广阔的草原像一块没有尽头的地毯，点缀着新建的灰白色的牧场办公室和马厩。一群群棕色的马、牛和雪白的绵羊，在那里静静地吃草。
    察北牧场是在一九五○年建立的。这个牧场的任务是繁殖从苏联输入的乘挽兼用的优良种马和种牛、种羊，并利用杂交的方法培育新的牲畜品种，向华北、内蒙等地区推广。
    这个牧场已经初具规模。它有四百多名职工，九万亩土地（其中草原有六万亩，其它三万亩是可以耕种的土地），三百多匹苏联纯血马，二百多只美利奴羊，五十多头短角乳肉兼用的种牛。另有培育新品种用的三千多只蒙古羊，一百多头蒙古牛，一百多匹蒙古马。还有一个分场，专门生产马粮。这个牧场在张北、尚义等县设立了六个良马配种站，以便在牧民中进行马匹杂交推广，它还和察哈尔省人民政府共同建立了七处牛、羊配种站，采用先进的配种方法推广新品种。
    察北牧场在短短的两年中间，获得了相当显著的成绩。一九五一年该场的种马受孕率为百分之七十五点八（过去成绩优良的马场的种马受孕率不超过百分之七十），产驹率达百分之九十点九，成活率为百分之九十六点六。种羊受孕率为百分之九十八点三，产羔率为百分之一百四十五，成活率为百分之九十八·八。种牛的受孕率、产犊率、成活率都是百分之百。该场在牧区推广杂交良种的工作，也获得一定的成绩。一九五一年共配民马二千三百七十多匹，受孕率为百分之三十。今年计划杂交配种四千三百二十匹马，据今年六月底的统计数字，六个良马配种站已经超额完成任务。现在，杂交配种的范围一天比一天扩大，康保、沽源等地牧民，也带马到配种站进行杂交配种。
    察北牧场对种马、种牛、种羊的饲养管理，从马厩的建筑到牲畜的饲养、调教、人工授精和医疗，都采用了苏联的先进经验。这是我国接受苏联先进经验最快的和最彻底的一个牧场。这主要因为，该场的领导干部接受苏联经验的决心很大，苏联专家对该场的工作，又作了具体的指导和耐心的帮助。每做一件新的工作，或改变一种旧的方法的时候，苏联专家总要说明为什么要实行新的方法，并和旧的方法加以比较，然后亲自做一遍给职工看，再让职工去试做。一九五一年，种马产马驹后，马奶不够用，很多小驹要吃牛乳。苏联专家指出马奶不够用的主要原因是对怀孕母马饲养不当，怀驹的母马不应按照一般的种马来饲养，而应适当地增加饲料。今年该场采纳了苏联专家的建议，母马的马奶都够用了。最近苏联专家在一个山坡上发现了一种名叫“香蒿”的野草，他马上建议牧场派人采集。他说，这种“香蒿”含有多量维他命，可以作为饲料；并且含有“山道年”成份，羊吃了这种香蒿，可以除虫。牧场根据专家的意见，马上派人采集香蒿。
    在建场初期，许多职工，特别是那些在旧牧场工作过的职工，曾经存在着保守思想，他们抗拒先进经验。技术工人王希贤在日本人办的通辽马场工作过六年，他熟悉日本人那一套饲养管理马匹的方法，他认为要想调教马匹，首先要以武力征服了它；苏联的调教马匹的方法，像哄孩子一样，亲切而且耐心地加以诱导，他认为这是不能调教出好马来的。但是，事实证明，实行苏联的调教方法，在一年以内调教出二十多匹成年种马，这种成绩，用旧的方法是不可能出现的。
    当地牧民的保守思想最初也是很严重的。这就影响了牧场的杂交推广工作。去年牧场开始用苏联种马和民间的马匹进行交配的时候，很多牧民说：“苏联种马只能在机关里摆样子，不能使用”。他们特别反对对马匹实行人工授精的方法，认为这是完全不可靠的。察北牧场为了解决牧民中这些保守思想，在今年五月张北县的庙会上，组织了一次展览比赛会。在这次比赛会上，用苏联种马和蒙古马赛跑，并比赛拉车。当时用普通的苏联种马和有名的蒙古快马赛跑一千二百公尺，苏联种马到达终点的时候，蒙古马落后三百五十三公尺；比赛拉车时，拉二千五百斤的东西，走三千公尺，不常拉车的苏联种马拉到终点，一点也不气喘，常拉车的蒙古马只拉了二百六十公尺就拉不动了。在庙会上还展览了以人工授精生出的杂种驹，当场还表演了人工授精的方法。这些实际的教育，使牧民开始改变了许多错误的看法。
    有些牧民的马匹和苏联种马交配了，今年生了小驹。这些小驹个个都是很好的。张北城关一个牧民的母马生了一个杂种驹，全家人欢天喜地，邀请乡亲们前去参观。这个牧民抚摸着马驹的背说：“多好的驹子！个子大，体型、毛色没有不好的地方，这驹子比它娘可好多了！”张北县二眼井牧民李占林的两匹马在去年受胎，一匹是人工授精，一匹是本交，今年两匹马都生了驹，两匹马驹同样的活泼可爱。李占林牵着小驹到处宣传，使许多牧民知道了苏联种马的好处和人工授精的好处。
