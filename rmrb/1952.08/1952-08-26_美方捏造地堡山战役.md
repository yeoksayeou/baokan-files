Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 25th: Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker," reports: The recent incessant clamoring by the U.S. side to publicize the "Bunker Hill Battle" is a ploy to deceive the public and create sensational news. The U.S. side's fabrication of the Chinese People's Volunteers suffering such-and-such losses at Bunker Hill is merely a habitual trick of theirs to use computers to cover up their own losses. Now that there are no military secrets involved, it wouldn't hurt to talk about the real situation at Bunker Hill.

The name of this mountain cannot be found on any map. This mountain is a position of the U.S. troops, and it has some importance to them in terms of combat because it commands their other positions from a high vantage point. However, Bunker Hill itself is controlled by higher ground overlooking it, and these highlands are firmly in the hands of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The U.S. side's propaganda that "they can see the backyard of the Chinese army" from Bunker Hill is completely nonsense. They want to hold Bunker Hill because from this mountain, the Chinese People's Volunteers can see the backyard of the U.S. army even more closely. The Chinese People's Volunteers only launched small-scale offensives against this mountain, but it has already caused the U.S. military to suffer about 700 casualties.

The reporter has studied the recent military situation and knows that since the demarcation line was determined last November, the front line east of Panmunjom has gradually shifted south to the U.S. military's Bunker Hill position. This mountain is near the road that the U.S. delegation must pass when traveling between Panmunjom and Munsan, which is also one of the reasons why the U.S. side is making such a fuss. The fact that the positions in this area are gradually shifting south not only exposes the bankruptcy of the propaganda about Bunker Hill but also the "military pressure" that the U.S. side boasts about. The U.S. side now prohibits the disclosure of the unit numbers of the troops near this area, which also shows the kind of losses they have suffered here.

    美方捏造地堡山战役
    【新华社开城二十五日电】伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿报道：美方最近吵嚷不休地宣传“地堡山战役”，这是为了欺骗公众和制造耸人听闻的新闻。美方捏造中国人民志愿军在地堡山受到如何如何的损失，这原是美方为了掩饰自己的损失而惯耍的一套计算机把戏。现在已没有军事保密问题存在，因此不妨说说地堡山的实情。
    这座山的名字在地图上是找不到的。这座山是美国军队的一个阵地，在作战方面对他们有一些重要性，因为它居高临下地控制着他们的其他阵地。可是地堡山本身又受着俯瞰它的高地所控制，而这些山地却稳稳地掌握在中国人民志愿军的手中。美方宣传说，从地堡山上“他们可以看到中国军队的后院”，这完完全全是胡说。他们想守住地堡山，因为从这座山上中国人民志愿军可以更近地看到美国军队的后院。中国人民志愿军只对这座山发动过小规模进攻，可是就已使美军伤亡约七百人之多。
    记者曾研究过最近的军事情况，知道从去年十一月确定分界线以来，板门店以东的战线逐渐南移到美军的地堡山阵地。这座山就在美方代表团往返于板门店和汶山之间时必经的道路附近，这也是美方大声吵嚷的一个原因。这一带阵地逐渐南移的事实，不但使关于地堡山的宣传破了产，而且使美方大事吹嘘的“军事压力”也破了产。美方现在禁止透露这个地区附近的军队的番号，这也说明他们在这里受到了怎样的损失。
