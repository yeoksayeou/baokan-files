Celebrating the Great Achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Liu Ningyi
    The 25th Anniversary Sports Meet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, celebrating the "August 1st" Army Day, solemnly opened in the capital of our great motherland, Beijing, on August 1st. I, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, extend warm congratulations to the conference!
    In this sports meet, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved outstanding results in military sports competitions, general sports competitions, cultural test competitions, and literary and artistic competitions. On the afternoon of August 2, naval athletes held a water armed swimming performance in Beihai, demonstrating their extraordinary skills and physical strength in long-distance swimming with weight. An ordinary swimmer wearing a swimsuit would generally take 18 to 20 minutes to swim 800 meters, while naval athletes carrying 15 kilograms of weight swam 800 meters in only 16 minutes. According to statistics on August 6, at least four track and field event results have broken the highest national records since liberation. Following this, the high jump result was announced as 1.76 meters, breaking the highest national record of 1.75 meters since liberation. The men's 800-meter relay final result was one minute 35.7 seconds, breaking the highest national record of one minute 42 seconds since liberation. In terms of literary and artistic competitions, the fighting and mass character of the PLA's literary and artistic work has been fully demonstrated. This is also the fine tradition inherited and developed by the PLA's literary and artistic work in various development stages. In terms of cultural learning, there have also been tremendous achievements. The cultural learning exhibition of the sports meet troops tells us many amazing achievements, especially reflecting that since the People's Liberation Army implemented Qi Jianhua's "rapid literacy method," some troops have basically eliminated illiteracy. The exhibition is full of charts, photos, comic strips, posters, vivid objects, assignments, and exceptionally exquisite teaching tools and instruments invented and created by the vast numbers of teachers and students. This shows that the people's revolutionary fighters have unparalleled creative genius and have created a miracle in the history of cultural learning that China has never seen in thousands of years.
    All of the above shows that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has not only been able to defeat all enemies at home and abroad and gained rich experience in army building and combat over the past 25 years, but has also achieved remarkable and brilliant achievements in cultural education, sports, military technology, and literary and artistic activities. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has developed and grown unprecedentedly. The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country feel very honored to have such a powerful revolutionary armed force. In the past three years, while defending the cause of defending the motherland, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has directly participated in reclamation, afforestation, railway construction, highway construction, factory construction, water conservancy construction, and other work. They are not only a great force for military construction and national defense construction, but also a huge force for production construction and cultural construction, which is even more worthy of our boasting.
    In the past three years, the Chinese working class has also achieved brilliant results on the production front. In the future, we will also vigorously promote the "rapid literacy method" among the working masses, carry out the movement to eliminate illiteracy, and vigorously promote sports activities among the workers so that the workers have a strong body and excellent qualities of courage, perseverance, resourcefulness, and collectivism.
    New China is advancing rapidly. The People's Liberation Army has established a brand-new air force, navy, armored forces, artillery, and various special forces on the basis of a strong army. However, this is only the beginning of our great construction project. In the future, we must continue to work together and strive to build a strong national defense force and economic force, and fight to the end to defend the security of the motherland and to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    庆祝中国人民解放军的巨大成就

    庆祝中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会已于八月一日在伟大祖国的首都——北京隆重地开幕了，我代表中华全国总工会向大会致以热烈的祝贺！
    在这次运动大会中，中国人民解放军在军事体育比赛、一般体育比赛、文化测验比赛、文艺比赛等方面，都获得了卓越的成绩。八月二日下午，海军运动员在北海举行水上武装游泳表演，表现了他们负重长途游泳的非凡技术和体力，一个普通的游泳员，穿着游泳衣游八百公尺，一般也得费十八至二十分钟，而海军运动员们载着十五斤重量游八百公尺，只费十六分钟。据八月六日统计，已至少有四项田径赛的成绩突破了解放后全国的最高纪录。接着又公布了跳高成绩为一点七六公尺，突破了解放后全国一点七五公尺的最高纪录，男子八百公尺接力决赛的成绩是一分三十五秒七，突破了解放后全国一分四十二秒的最高纪录。在文艺比赛方面，充分地表现了解放军文艺工作的战斗性和群众性的特色，这也是中国人民解放军在各个发展时期文艺工作所继承和发扬的优良传统。在文化学习方面，也同样有着巨大的成就，体育运动大会部队文化学习展览会告诉我们很多惊人的成绩，特别是反映了人民解放军自实行祁建华“速成识字法”以来，某些部队已基本上消灭了文盲。在展览会上布满了图表、照片、连环画、挂图，逼真生动的实物、作业，和广大教员与学员所发明创造的异常精致的教学用具、仪器等，这说明人民革命战士有着无比的创造天才，创造了中国几千年来在文化学习史上所没有过的奇迹。
    以上的一切，说明了中国人民解放军二十五年来在中国共产党和毛主席、朱总司令英明的领导下，不仅能战胜国内外的一切敌人，获得了丰富的建军作战经验，而且在文化教育、体育运动、军事技术和文艺活动等方面也获得了显著辉煌的巨大成就，中国人民解放军已经空前地发展与壮大起来了，中国工人阶级和全国人民有着这样强大的革命武装力量是感觉非常荣耀的。三年来，中国人民解放军一面捍卫着保卫祖国的事业，一面直接参加垦荒、植林、修铁路、筑公路、建工场、修水利等工作，他们不仅是军事建设、国防建设的伟大力量，同时也成为生产建设、文化建设的巨大力量，这就更值得我们夸耀了。
    三年来，中国工人阶级在生产战线上也获得了辉煌的成绩，今后我们也将在工人群众中大力推广“速成识字法”，开展扫除文盲的运动，也要在工人群众中大力提倡体育活动，使工人同志们具有健壮的身体与勇敢、坚毅、机智和集体主义的优良品质。
    新中国在急速地前进，人民解放军在强大的陆军的基础上建立了崭新的空军、海军、装甲兵、炮兵和各种特种部队，但这仅仅是我们伟大建设工程的开始，今后我们必须共同不断地努力，为建设强大的国防力量和经济力量而奋斗，为保卫祖国的安全，为保卫远东和世界的和平奋斗到底。
