    State-run Ranch Changes the Face of the Prairie
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    The public ranch in the Xilingol-Chahar area of Inner Mongolia is located on a vast prairie, with the winding Shanding River flowing past its southern edge. The newly built houses and white Mongolian yurts indicate that this is a newly established ranch.
    The Xilingol-Chahar area public ranch was established in 1950, raising livestock such as horses, cattle, sheep, and camels. The ranch has commodity farms and breeding farms, each with grazing groups and milk groups.
    The main task of the commodity farm is to maintain the livestock of the herders, that is, to buy the sick, thin, and small livestock from the herders, raise them to be strong, fat, and large, and then sell them back to the herders. In the past two or three years, the commodity farm has achieved great results. In the first half of 1952 alone, more than 10,000 head of livestock were raised and sold through the commodity farm. The breeding farm was established in 1951, and its main task is to breed Mongolian horses, Mongolian cattle, and Mongolian sheep. Its breeding stock is selected from the livestock raised on the commodity farm. Recently, the breeding farm has added the task of improving livestock breeds, crossbreeding Soviet stallions with Mongolian horses to cultivate new breeds. Each branch farm has a milk extraction team, specializing in the production of butter, milk tofu, milk wine, and so on.
    When this ranch was established in 1950, it had nothing except some livestock bought from the herders. Some of the employees in the ranch were local workers with old animal husbandry experience, but new workers accounted for a large number, and there were very few technicians. These added many difficulties to the work of the ranch. However, the employees were not intimidated by the difficulties. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, they put forward the slogan of overcoming any difficulties that arise. If they did not understand animal husbandry technology, they would learn from the masses; if they had any difficult problems, they would mobilize everyone to find solutions. The ranch grew stronger day by day.
    Here is a story:
    In this area of the prairie, frost occurs around the "Grain Full" season every year, and herders' livestock die from the frost every year. When the staff in the ranch learned about this situation, they were all very anxious. Because the ranch had not yet built cold-proof facilities, and the newly purchased livestock were thin and sick, lacking the strength to resist the cold. Everyone thought for several days, but could not come up with a good solution. At this time, someone suggested, why don't livestock die in winter?
    (Livestock also die in winter, but in small numbers) Ask the herders here, and they will surely be able to think of a good solution. A word reminded everyone, and people went to the local herders to inquire about the reasons for the livestock freezing to death around the "Grain Full" season. After investigation and research in various aspects, it was found that the main reason for the livestock freezing to death around the "Grain Full" season was that local herders did not pay attention to the seasonal climate. As soon as spring arrived, they released the livestock, and the livestock would shed their hair after eating green grass. When the old hair was falling out and the new hair had not grown out
    (late spring and early summer), the weather changed, and the livestock could not withstand the attack of the severe cold, and a stampede inevitably occurred. In this cold weather, after the livestock ran and sweated, they would freeze to death. Therefore, if the livestock could be prevented from stampeding when the frost came around the "Grain Full" season, they would not freeze to death. The ranch analyzed the above situation and decided to put the herds in leeward grasslands and set up livestock pens to prevent stampedes, which completely prevented this natural disaster. For more than two years, the ranch has used this method and has not frozen a single head of livestock to death.
    The ranch also went through a long period of exploration in order to improve animal husbandry methods. In the early days of the ranch's establishment, some workers who had grazed in the local area still used the old methods of the past, driving the herds out and then ignoring them. This method has many disadvantages. There is dew on the grass in the morning, and all kinds of insects crawl onto the grass leaves. Livestock are prone to disease if they eat grass with insects. The staff in the ranch paid attention to this, and would not graze until the dew had fallen (when the dew falls, the insects also crawl down); the incidence of livestock diseases was greatly reduced. The herders here graze during the day, but the weather is hot during the day, and the horses are too hot to eat grass; in the cool evening, when the horses want to eat grass, it is time to herd them back. If the horses do not eat grass, their performance and physique will definitely deteriorate. The ranch changed this method and made it a rule to graze the horses at night and rest during the day. This is suitable for horses. When local herders graze horses, they generally drive the herds to a grassland and do not move for a long time. This is bad for both livestock and grasslands. Livestock like to eat fresh grass leaves. If they stay in a grassland for a long time, most of the grass leaves are eaten, and the grass stalks are trampled by the livestock, which the livestock do not like to eat; if the green grass is damaged too much, it is not easy to grow well. The ranch changed this old method. They first selected the grasslands, and then drove the herds there. After the livestock had eaten through this grassland once, they immediately changed to a new grassland, so that the livestock could eat their fill and protect the grassland.
    The Xilingol-Chahar area public ranch uses these new methods to raise its own herds. The livestock are getting fatter and stronger day by day. At first, the ranch's livestock were not as good as the local herders' livestock, and the herders also looked down on the ranch's staff. One herder said: "Let's try it and see who can herd the herds well." However, after a few months, the situation changed. The herders of Huangqi and Daying had a herd of five or six hundred horses, which used to be better than the herds in the ranch. After three or four months, the ranch cured the sick horses and fattened the thin horses, and quickly turned them into herds of horses that were even stronger than the herders' horses.
    The situation of other livestock is the same. The ranch adopted new sheep-raising methods, and three-month-old lambs can kill twenty-five catties of net meat, while the herders' three-month-old lambs are at most less than twenty catties. The general dairy cows in the ranch can squeeze seven catties of milk a day, while the herders' dairy cows can squeeze at most four or five catties a day. When a herder visited the breeding farm, he saw
    a brown stallion with white hooves. This horse was originally a bad horse he had sold. He hugged the neck of the stallion and said: "This is my horse! Last year I sold you as waste, and now you have become so fat and strong!" This herder insisted on staying in the farm to learn new horse-raising methods. What made the herders envious was not only this, but also those groups of lambs and calves, which attracted the local herders every time they went out to pasture. A herder said to the sheep-herding workers: "What method do you use to divide the sheep so quickly, and the young livestock grow so neatly?" The worker told him: "The method is very simple. We have mastered the time for breeding and producing young livestock. When it is time for breeding, we will combine the wethers and ewes (usually separated). In this way, the ewes will give birth to lambs at the same time, and it will be easy to divide the flock when the time comes." Originally, the herders' wethers and ewes (the same is true for other livestock) were not separated, and the mating time of the sheep was difficult to control. Therefore, ewes gave birth to lambs all year round. The lambs did not grow uniformly, and it was difficult to divide the flock. The herders did not pay attention to dividing the flock (separating the large sheep from the small sheep), and the lambs grew very large without being weaned, which was harmful to both the large and small sheep. After listening to the sheep-herding worker's words, the herder thought for a long time and said: "Your method is good, I will definitely do it according to your method." A herder named Batu Ba in Silangcheng Village helped out in the ranch for a period of time and learned new animal husbandry methods. After he returned home, he also used new methods to raise his own livestock, and his herd has become the best herd in Silangcheng.
    The animal husbandry methods of the Xilingol-Chahar area public ranch have won the praise of local herders. Many herders have begun to accept these new methods. In the near future, when these new animal husbandry methods are widely promoted, the face of the entire prairie will undergo a great change.

### 公营牧场改变着草原的面貌

    公营牧场改变着草原的面貌
    本报记者　朱波
    内蒙古锡察区公营牧场设在一片广阔的草原上，闪电河的流水从南边弯弯曲曲地流过它的身旁。新建的房舍，白色的蒙古包，都说明这是一个新建的牧场。
    锡察区公营牧场成立于一九五○年，场内饲养着马、牛、羊、骆驼等牲畜。牧场下设商品场和繁殖场，每个场里设有放牧小组和牛奶小组。
    商品场的主要任务是保养牧民的牲畜，即买进牧民的病畜、瘦畜、小畜，养成壮的、肥的、大的，再卖给牧民。两三年来，商品场获得了很大的成绩，仅一九五二年上半年经过商品场养好出售的牲畜即达一万多头。繁殖场是在一九五一年建立的，它的任务主要是繁殖蒙古马、蒙古牛和蒙古羊。它的种畜都是从商品场养好的牲畜中挑选的。最近繁殖场增添了改良牲畜的品种的任务，以苏联种马和蒙古马进行杂交，培育新的品种。各分场都设有挤牛奶小组，专门制造黄油、奶豆腐、奶子酒等。
    这个牧场在一九五○年建场时，除了从牧民中收买来的一些牲畜外，其他什么也没有。场内的职工有一些是从当地吸收的有旧的畜牧经验的工人，但新工人占了很大的数目，技术人员很少。这些都给牧场工作增加了很多困难。但是，职工们并没有被困难吓倒，他们在党和人民政府领导下，提出了有什么困难就克服什么困难的口号。不懂畜牧技术，就向群众学习；有了疑难问题，就发动大家想办法。牧场一天天壮大起来。
    有这样一个故事：
    在这一带草原上，每年“小满”前后要上一次冻，每年都有牧民的牲畜要被冻死。场内工作人员知道了这个情况，大家都很焦急。因为场内还没有建设防寒设备，而新买的牲畜又都是瘦的和病的，没有抵抗寒冷的力量。大家想了几天，也没有想出好办法来。这时有人提出，为什么冬季不冻死牲畜呢？
    （冬季也有冻死牲畜的时候，但是为数很少）问问这里的牧民，一定能想出好办法。一句话提醒了大家，人们分头向当地牧民访问“小满”前后冻死牲畜的原因。经过各方面调查研究，发现在“小满”前后冻死牲畜的主要原因是当地牧民不注意季节气候。他们一到春季就把牲畜放出去了，牲畜吃了青草就要脱毛。正在旧毛脱落新毛没有长出来的时候
    （春末夏初），天气变了，牲畜受不住严寒的袭击，必然发生惊群的现象，在这寒冷的天气里，牲畜奔驰出汗以后，就要冻死了。因此，如果在“小满”前后上冻时，能够不使牲畜惊群，它们就不会被冻死。牧场分析以上这种情况，决定把牧群放在背风的草地上，并设立牲畜圈不使惊群，结果完全防止了这种天灾。二年多来牧场利用这个办法，没有冻死过一个牲畜。
    牧场为了改善畜牧方法，也经过很长时期的摸索。在建场初期，有些曾在当地放牧的工人，还使用过去的旧方法，把牧群赶出去就不管了。这种办法有很多害处。早晨的草上有露水，各种虫子都爬到草叶上来，牲畜吃了带有虫子的草，很容易得病。牧场里职工注意了这一点，一定等到露水落下去了（露水落下去，虫子也爬下去了）再放牧；牲畜得病的大为减少。这里的牧民都是白天放牧，但白天天气炎热，马热得吃不下草去；晚晌天气凉爽，马想吃草了，又到收牧的时候了。马吃不进草去，它的性能体质一定要变坏。牧场改变了这种办法，定为夜里放马，白天休息。这对马是适宜的。当地牧民放马时，一般都是把牧群赶到一个草地里，很长时间不移动地方。这对牲畜和草原都有坏处。牲畜喜欢吃新鲜的草叶，在一块草地待久了，草叶多被吃光，草茎被牲畜踏来踏去，牲畜都不喜欢吃；青草受损失过重，也不易长好。牧场改变了这种旧方法。他们先把草地选好，然后再把牧群赶去。牲畜在这个草地吃过一遍以后，立刻再换一块新的草地，这样牲畜吃的饱，又能保护草原。
    锡察区公营牧场用这些新的方法饲养自己的牧群。牲畜一天天肥壮起来了。起初牧场的牲畜比不上当地牧民的牲畜，牧民们也瞧不起牧场的人员。有一个牧民说：“试试吧，看谁的牧群放得好。”但是，几个月以后，情况变了。黄旗、大营的牧民有一个五、六百匹马的马群，曾经比牧场里的马群好。过了三、四个月，牧场把病马治好，把瘦马养肥，很快变成比牧民的马还健壮的马群。
    其它牲畜的情况也是一样。牧场采用了新的牧羊方法，三个月的小羊能杀二十五斤净肉，而牧民的三个月的小羊最多不到二十斤。牧场里一般的乳牛每天可挤七斤牛奶，而牧民的乳牛每天最多只能挤四、五斤。有一个牧民参观繁殖场时，看见
    一匹棕色白蹄的种马，这匹马原来是他卖掉的一匹坏马。他抱着这匹种马的脖子说：“这是我的马呀！去年我把你当作废物卖掉，现在你变成这样肥壮了！”这个牧民一定要留在场里，学习新的养马方法。使牧民羡慕的还不止于此，那一群群的小羊、小牛，每次出牧时，都吸引着当地的牧民。有一个牧民向放羊的工人说：“你们用什么方法把羊群分得这样快，小牲畜又长得这样整齐？”工人告诉他说：“方法很简单。我们掌握了配种和生产小牲畜的时间，到配种的时候，再把犍羊和母羊合群（平时分开），这样母羊生小羊的时间是统一的，到分群时就好办了。”原来牧民的犍羊和母羊（其它牲畜也是一样）是不分群的，羊的交配时间很难掌握，因此，一年四季都有母羊生小羊。小羊长的不齐，分群时很困难。牧民不注意分群（把大羊和小羊分开），小羊长了很大不能断奶，这对大羊、小羊都有害处。这位牧民听了牧羊工人的话，想了好一会说：“你们这办法好，我一定按着你们的方法做。”四郎城村有一个名叫巴图巴的牧民，在牧场里帮过一个时期的忙，学了新的畜牧方法。他回家后，也以新方法来饲养自己的牲畜，他的牧群已成为四郎城最好的牧群了。
    锡察区公营牧场的畜牧方法获得了当地牧民的好评。许多牧民开始接受了这些新方法。在不久的将来，当着这些新的畜牧方法普遍推广以后，整个草原的面貌就要大变了。
