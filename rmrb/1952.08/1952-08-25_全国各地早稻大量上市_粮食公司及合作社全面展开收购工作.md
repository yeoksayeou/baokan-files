Early Rice Enters Market in Large Quantities Across the Country
　　Grain Companies and Cooperatives Fully Commence Procurement Work
　　Early rice has entered the market in a steady stream across the country, and state-owned grain companies and cooperatives have fully commenced procurement work.

　　This year, early rice has generally seen a bumper harvest. In the early rice producing areas of Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, production generally increased by 10 to 20 percent compared to last year. Early rice in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi successively entered the market in mid-June. Early rice in Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Sichuan also entered the market successively in mid-July. In August, early rice entered the market in large quantities in various regions. In Nanchang, Ji'an, and Fuzhou in Jiangxi, and in Nanxian, Anxiang, and Huarong in the lakeside producing areas of Hunan, the daily market volume exceeded one million catties. In Jinhua, Lanxi, Ningbo, Longyou, Huangyan, and Yueqing in Zhejiang, and in Changsha, Hengyang, and Changde in Hunan, and in Qujiang, Huizhou, and Shantou in Guangdong, the daily market volume was also between 200,000 and 500,000 catties.

　　State-owned grain companies in various regions have promptly arranged procurement work based on the market situation of early rice. They have also absorbed the experience of wheat procurement and continued to entrust cooperatives to purchase on their behalf in rural primary markets, implementing the principle of simultaneous urban and rural procurement. In July, the national monthly plan for the purchase of rice (including rice converted from paddy) was completed at 247 percent, and the procurement plan was also exceeded in early August. Due to the large-scale procurement by the state, the price of early rice has been stabilized. According to a survey of 24 major markets in Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, the market price and the listed price were basically consistent in early August, which shows that the state's procurement plan has basically met the needs of farmers selling grain.

　　In the work of procuring early rice, the grain companies and cooperatives have been well integrated. In a few areas, the procurement work was affected and the market price was low because state-owned grain companies and cooperatives failed to sign procurement contracts in a timely manner. Relevant leading authorities in various regions are correcting this phenomenon.

　　Grain companies in various regions have correctly grasped regional price differences, which has encouraged the enthusiasm of grain merchants for rational operation. In early August, state procurement accounted for 78.4 percent of the market volume in 14 regions of Zhejiang, and private merchants accounted for 21.6 percent. During the same period, in the six major markets of Hankou, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Hengyang, and Jiujiang, state procurement accounted for 60.6 percent of the market volume, and private merchants accounted for 39.4 percent. However, there are still cases of regional price differences being too tight or too wide in some areas. For example, the price difference between rice in Nanxian and Anxiang in the lakeside area of Hunan and Changsha and Hankou reached 18.4 to 29.7 percent. The price difference between rice in Xinfeng, southern Jiangxi, and Nanxiong, Guangdong, reached 61.1 percent, which is too large. On the other hand, the regional price difference of rice in Guangzhou and Huizhou, Qujiang, and Zhujiang in Guangdong, and in Changsha and Xiangyin, Yiyang, and Wangcheng in Hunan, is too small. These phenomena should be appropriately adjusted.

### 全国各地早稻大量上市  粮食公司及合作社全面展开收购工作

    全国各地早稻大量上市
    粮食公司及合作社全面展开收购工作
    全国各地早稻源源上市，国营粮食公司和合作社已全面展开收购工作。
    今年早稻普告丰收。湖南、江西、广东、浙江早稻产区，一般都比去年增产一成到二成。广东、广西、江西的早稻在六月中旬即相继上市。湖南、湖北、浙江、四川的早稻也在七月中旬陆续上市。八月份各地早稻大量上市，江西南昌、吉安、抚州，湖南滨湖产区的南县、安乡、华容等地，每日上市量在百万斤以上，浙江金华、兰溪、宁波、龙游、黄岩、乐清，湖南长沙、衡阳、常德，广东曲江、惠州、汕头等地，每天上市量也在二十至五十万斤之间。
    各地国营粮食公司根据早稻上市的情况，及时布置了收购工作，并吸取收购小麦的经验，继续委托合作社深入农村初级市场代购，贯彻城乡兼收的方针。七月份全国完成收购大米（其中包括谷折米）的月计划的百分之二百四十七，八月上旬也超过了收购计划。由于国家的大量收购，保持了早稻价格的稳定。根据湖南、湖北、广东、江西、浙江五省二十四个主要市场的调查，八月上旬市价和牌价基本上是吻合的，这就说明国家的收购计划，基本上满足了农民售粮的要求。
    在收购早稻的工作中，粮食公司与合作社是结合得很好的。在少数地区，由于国营粮食公司和合作社迟迟未订代购合同，影响了收购工作，发生了市价偏低的现象。各地有关领导机关正在纠正这种现象。
    各地粮食公司正确地掌握了地区差价，这就鼓励了粮商合理经营的积极性。八月上旬，浙江十四个地区国家收购量占上市量百分之七十八点四，私商收购量占二十一点六；同一时间汉口、广州、长沙、南昌、衡阳、九江六大市场，国家收购量占上市量百分之六○点六，私商收购量占百分之三十九点四。但个别地区的地区差价仍有偏紧偏宽现象，如湖南滨湖地区南县、安乡与长沙、汉口的稻米差价达百分之十八点四到二十九点七，赣南信丰与广东南雄的稻米差价达百分之六十一点一，这都是过大的；而广东的广州与惠州、曲江、珠江等地，湖南的长沙和湘阴、益阳、望城等地稻米的地区差价，又嫌过小；这种现象都应加以适当的调整。
