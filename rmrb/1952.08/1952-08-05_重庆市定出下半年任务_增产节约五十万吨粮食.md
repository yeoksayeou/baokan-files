    Chongqing Sets Second Half Task
    Increase Production and Practice Economy by 500,000 Tons of Grain
    The first session of the Third Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference was held from July 28th to 30th. The conference summarized the government work of 1951 and the achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and determined that achieving and striving to overfulfill the task of increasing production and practicing economy by 500,000 tons of grain in Chongqing this year would be the central task for the second half of 1952.
    Mayor Cao Diqiu pointed out in his report that due to the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in Chongqing, the development of increased production movements in various regions, the increase in national investment, the increase in farmers' purchasing power after the land reform in rural areas, the full opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and the increasing improvement of water and land transportation conditions, the conditions for the further prosperity of industry and commerce in Chongqing have been fully met. Cao Diqiu pointed out that in the second half of this year, in addition to continuing to strengthen urban-rural exchanges to strive for further market prosperity, a broad and in-depth patriotic production increase competition movement should be launched. In the industrial sector, state-owned enterprises should carefully check this year's production increase and economy practice plans and the completion status in the first half of the year, and set specific goals for the second half of the year. Administrative leaders at all levels and grassroots trade unions should regard discovering and promoting advanced production experience as an important part of carrying out the production increase and economy practice movement.
    During the conference discussion, the representatives unanimously supported Mayor Cao Diqiu's report. Representatives from workers, farmers, culture and education, industry and commerce, and other sectors all expressed in group discussions and plenary speeches that they would definitely complete the glorious task of increasing production and practicing economy by 500,000 tons of grain, and ensure that they would take the lead in implementing the resolutions of the conference among the masses. Worker and farmer representatives also exchanged experiences in carrying out production increase competitions at the conference. Representatives from State-owned Steel Plant 101 and the privately-owned Shashi Yarn Factory proposed to launch competitions in factories and enterprises, put forward more rationalization proposals, improve work efficiency, and create new records. Representatives of suburban farmers proposed to check production plans, continue to work hard to prevent floods, droughts, and pests, and do a good job in autumn harvesting and seed selection. Representatives from industry and commerce expressed that they would overcome difficulties, actively operate, strive to improve product quality, and promote urban-rural trade to further prosper the market.

    重庆市定出下半年任务
    增产节约五十万吨粮食
    重庆市第三届第一次各界人民代表会议已于七月二十八日到三十日举行。会议总结了一九五一年的政府工作和“三反”、“五反”运动的成就，确定了以实现并争取超额完成重庆市今年增产节约五十万吨粮食为一九五二年下半年的中心任务。
    曹荻秋市长在报告中指出：由于重庆市“三反”“五反”运动的胜利，各地增产运动的开展，国家投资的增大，农村土地改革后农民购买力的提高，成渝铁路的全线通车，水陆运输条件的日益改进，重庆市工商业进一步繁荣的条件已完全具备。曹荻秋指出，今年下半年除继续加强城乡交流以争取市场的进一步繁荣外，应广泛和深入地展开爱国增产竞赛运动。在工业方面，各国营企业应认真检查今年增产节约计划与上半年完成情况，订出今年下半年的具体奋斗目标。各级行政领导与基层工会应把发现与推广先进生产经验作为开展增产节约运动的重要环节。
    会议讨论中，代表们一致拥护曹荻秋市长的报告。工人、农民、文教、工商等各界代表都在小组讨论和大会发言中表示一定完成增产节约五十万吨粮食的光荣任务，保证带头在群众中贯彻执行大会的决议。工人、农民代表们并在会议上交流了开展增产竞赛的经验。国营一零一钢铁厂、私营沙市纱厂的工人代表们提出要在工厂、企业中展开竞赛，多提合理化建议，提高工作效率，创造新纪录。郊区农民代表提出要检查生产计划，继续努力防涝、防旱、防虫，做好秋收选种工作。工商界代表表示要克服困难，积极经营，努力提高产品质量，搞好城乡贸易，使市场进一步繁荣。
