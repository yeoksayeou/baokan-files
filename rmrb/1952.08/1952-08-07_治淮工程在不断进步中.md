In the past two years, the Huai River project has made great progress in all aspects. The plans for design, planning, and construction have been continuously improved, and the experience accumulated in the construction process has become richer. This will greatly accelerate the progress of the Huai River project in the future and ensure continued and further major victories.

The Huai River project began in 1950. At that time, it was just after a major flood in the Huai River basin, and at the beginning of construction, the situation was urgent, and preparations in all aspects were insufficient. At that time, the State Council of the Central People's Government put forward the policy of: comprehensive storage and drainage, joint protection by three provinces, and turning water hazards into water conservancy. However, due to the extreme lack of comprehensive data on the Huai River, it was impossible to propose a complete and practical plan on how to effectively manage the Huai River at that time. Now, in the past two years of construction, a gradual understanding of the overall situation of the Huai River has been achieved. Therefore, based on the Huai River management policy of the State Council of the Central People's Government, there is a clearer understanding of how to specifically carry out the Huai River project. After surveying and calculation, the Huai River Commission determined that to thoroughly manage the Huai River, it is necessary to simultaneously address flood control, river regulation, and the extensive development of ditches, ponds, and dams, with close coordination. In terms of flood control, taking the largest flood year of the Huai River with 76 billion cubic meters of floodwater as an example, it is required to be able to store 20 billion cubic meters of floodwater in the upper and middle reaches. To complete this water storage task, a plan was formulated to build thirteen large-scale valley reservoirs and seventeen lake and depression flood storage projects in the upper and middle reaches. In terms of river regulation and the extensive development of ditches and ponds, complete plans have generally been made. For example, Fuyang and other regions in Henan Province in the upper reaches of the Huai River have made a five-year plan for the extensive development of ditches and ponds. There are clear goals for how many ditches to open, how many ponds to dig, and how many wells to drill in five years. From the perspective of the entire Huai River project, the progress of the project is increasingly on a normal track.

Not only is there a relatively complete plan for the entire basin, but there has also been significant progress in the specific design of certain projects. For example, when designing the Shimantan and Banqiao reservoirs in Henan at the beginning, although a plan for irrigation and benefiting the people was also proposed, it was very unspecific, and the original goal was not achieved during construction. The design of the Foziling Reservoir in the second year's project was a big step forward. After the completion of the Foziling Reservoir, it can store 500 million cubic meters of floodwater, reduce the flood peak of the Pi River, a tributary of the Huai River, irrigate 500,000 mu of farmland, and generate 4,000 kilowatts of electricity to develop agricultural product processing. The navigation of the Pi River has also been facilitated, allowing 50-ton wooden boats to travel directly from the Huai River to the Dabie Mountains. In the future, it is also planned to build a scenic and beautiful sanatorium area around the reservoir. In this way, the goal of multi-objective benefit is truly achieved. The Foziling Reservoir adopted the form of a continuous arch dam, which was also decided after detailed exploration, precise calculation, and very careful research. Before the decision, five different dam styles were proposed simultaneously. After careful planning and repeated research, an effective number was often calculated repeatedly seven or eight times before finally adopting the continuous arch dam form based on the principles of solidity and economy. The Dabie Mountains are an earthquake zone, and this type of dam is particularly suitable for earthquake zones.

In the past two years, the technical nature of various projects has been increasing day by day, which is manifested in the increasing use of machinery to replace the crude and simple tools of the countryside and to replace manpower. This can be seen in the reservoir project and many culvert gate projects. Although the number of culvert gates built in the second year of the Huai River project was less than that in the first year, the amount of concrete used was equivalent to three times that used in the first year. More than 110 kilometers of light railway were laid on the Baisha Reservoir construction site, and more than 5,000 dump trucks and flat cars were used to replace "a carrying pole and two baskets" to transport earth, with a daily soil volume of 40,000 cubic meters. There is a larger flat car, which the migrant workers call "turtle car", each car can carry more than 2,000 kilograms of soil, and only two migrant workers can push it and run on the railway. More than 30 bulldozers were often operated on the Baisha Reservoir construction site to pull sheep's horn rollers to replace stone rollers to compact the earth on the earth dam. After the bulldozer runs back and forth three times, the soil is compacted flat and solid. Dozens of workers operate more than 30 bulldozers on the construction site, with a daily soil volume of more than 40,000 cubic meters. Nearly 300 machines were used on the Foziling Reservoir construction site. Among them are grouting machines, rock drills, sawing machines, generators, pile drivers, concrete mixers, air compressors, electric winches, etc. The electric winch can replace manpower to raise 0.4 cubic meters of concrete from ground level to more than 200 feet.

In the two years of Huai River management, work efficiency has also increased day by day with the accumulation of experience and the continuous improvement of work methods. Difficult river dredging projects accounted for about half of the first year's project, and increased to 90 percent in the second year, and very difficult projects such as cutting ridges were also added. If difficult work is converted and calculated according to the basic formula, the overall work efficiency of the second year's project increased by 96 percent compared with the first year.

Now, all aspects of the Huai River project are advancing rapidly. A responsible comrade of the Huai River Commission once told reporters: "Based on the experience of the past two years, it is estimated that with the improvement of work efficiency and the strengthening of technicality, we will also greatly reduce the use of manpower and accelerate the progress of the project." Yes, the progress of all aspects of the Huai River project will ensure greater victory in the Huai River project. The number of migrant workers mobilized in the second year of the Huai River project was only about one-tenth more than that in the first year, but the projects completed (excluding projects run by farmers themselves) exceeded nearly twice that of the first year, which is a sufficient and powerful proof.

    治淮工程在不断进步中
    新华社记者  冒茀君
    两年来，治淮工程在各方面都获得很大的进步。在设计、规划、施工等各方面的计划都日臻完善，施工过程中积累的经验也更加丰富。这就大大加速今后治淮工程的进行，并保证继续获得更进一步的重大胜利。
    治淮工程是从一九五○年开始的。当时正是淮河流域发生大水灾之后，施工之初，情况紧迫，各方面准备都很不足。当时中央人民政府政务院提出：蓄泄兼筹，三省共保，变水害为水利的方针。但由于淮河全面的资料极其贫乏，究竟怎样治好淮河，一时提不出完整切实的计划。现在，在两年来的施工过程中，对淮河全面情况逐渐了解，因此根据中央人民政府政务院的治淮方针如何具体做好治淮工程，也有了更明确的认识。经过查勘计算之后，治淮委员会确定要彻底治好淮河必须从控制洪水、整理河道、广开沟洫塘坝三方面同时着手，密切配合。在控制洪水方面，如以淮河最大洪水年份发生洪水七百六十亿立方公尺计算，要求在上、中游能拦蓄洪水二百亿立方公尺。为了完成这个蓄水任务，拟定了在上、中游建造十三处大型山谷水库和十七处湖泊洼地蓄洪工程的计划。在整理河道和广开沟塘方面，一般也都有了完整的计划，如淮河上游河南省阜阳等专区在广开沟塘方面已作出了五年计划。五年中要开多少沟，挖多少塘，打多少井，都有了明确的目标。从整个治淮工程来看，工程的进行已日益走上正常的轨道。
    不仅在全流域方面有了比较完整的计划，在某些工程的具体设计上，也有了显著的进步。如开始在设计河南的石漫滩、板桥两座水库时，虽然也提出灌溉兴利的计划，但是非常不具体，施工中也未能达到原有的目标。第二年度工程中佛子岭水库的设计就大大的进了一步。佛子岭水库完成之后，可以拦蓄洪水五亿立方公尺，降低了淮河支流淠河的洪水峰，能灌溉五十万亩农田，还可发电四千瓩，以发展农业品加工事业，淠河的航运也便利了，可使五十吨的木船能从淮河直通大别山区，将来并拟在水库周围建造一个风景幽美的休养区。这样，便真正达到了多目标兴利的目的。佛子岭水库采取连拱坝的形式，也是经过详细勘察、精密计算和非常慎重研究之后决定的，未决定之前曾同时拟出五种不同的坝的式样，经过精密筹划，反覆研究，一个有效数字往往反覆计算达七、八次，最后才在坚固、经济等原则下，采用连拱坝的形式。大别山区是地震区，而这种坝正是特别适用于地震区的。
    两年来，各项工程的技术性日益加强，这表现在一天多似一天的采用机械代替了农村粗陋简单的工具，代替了人力。这可以从水库工程和许多涵闸工程中看出来。第二年度治淮工程中建造的涵闸座数虽比第一年少些，但所用的混凝土却相当于第一年所用的三倍。白沙水库工地上曾铺设轻便铁道一百一十多公里，开动五千多辆斗车和平车代替“一根扁担两只筐”来运土，每天上土经常达四万公方。有一种较大的平车，民工们叫它“鳖车”，每车能推土二千斤以上，只要两个民工就能在铁道上推着飞跑。白沙水库工地上又经常开动三十多部推土机拉着羊角碾代替石硪在土坝上压土。推土机来回三遍，土压得又平又结实。工地上几十个工人操纵着三十多部推土机，每天上土四万多公方。佛子岭水库工地上，使用的机器近三百部。其中有灌浆机、开山机、锯木机、发电机、打桩机、混凝土拌合机、空气压缩机、电动卷扬机等等，电动卷扬机可以代替人力把点四公方的混凝土由地平线升高到二百英尺以上。
    治淮两年来工作效率随着经验的累积和工作方法的不断改进，也一天一天提高了。第一年工程中困难的疏浚河道工程约占一半，第二年增加到百分之九十，而且还增加了切岭等非常艰难的工程。如将难工折合，按照基本方计算，第二年工程整个工作效率较第一年提高了百分之九十六。
    现在，治淮工程各方面都在迅速地向前推进着。治淮委员会一位负责同志曾对记者说：“根据两年来的经验估计，随着工作效率的提高，技术性的加强，今后我们也将大大减少人力的使用，并加速工程的进展。”是的，治淮工程各方面的进步，将保证治淮工程获得更大的胜利。第二年治淮工程动员的民工数只比第一年约多十分之一，但所做的工程（不包括农民自办的工程），却超过第一年将近一倍，这就是一个充分有力的证明。
