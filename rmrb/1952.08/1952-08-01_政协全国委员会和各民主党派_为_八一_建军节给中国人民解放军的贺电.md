To the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all commanders and fighters:

	The "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising took place twenty-five years ago today. All the people of China are jubilantly welcoming this glorious Army Day. On this great day, we, the various democratic parties, extend our warm congratulations and highest respect to you!

	The great day of "August 1st" opened up a new historical era for the Chinese revolution. Marshal Stalin pointed out in 1926: "In China, it is armed revolution against armed counter-revolution. This is one of the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, and it is also one of the advantages of the Chinese revolution." The "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising in 1927 was the day the Chinese people began to create their own armed revolutionary forces. Due to the birth, growth, and strengthening of the Chinese people's armed forces, the Chinese people's revolution has achieved today's brilliant victory and established the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people's armed forces have not only overthrown the domestic feudal, comprador-fascist reactionary regime, but also completely ended the imperialist rule in China for more than a hundred years. The success of the Chinese people's armed revolution proves that imperialist armed aggression can be defeated, and the national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies have a bright and victorious future.

	After the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising, the Chinese people's armed forces grew from a small number of Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to become today's powerful national defense force. The Chinese people's armed forces have consistently demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. Today, we not only have the strength to defend the security of our motherland, but also stand in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union to jointly shoulder the task of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. This is the glory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This is the glory of all the Chinese people. This glory is the result of the bloodshed and sacrifice of revolutionary martyrs, the result of the heroic struggle of the entire revolutionary ranks, and the result of the wise and correct leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao.

	The revolutionary armed forces led by Chairman Mao are not only armed with guns and cannons, but also armed with spirit and thought. The Chinese people's revolutionary ranks have armed themselves with Marxism-Leninism since their birth. The Chinese people's revolutionary ranks are composed of workers and peasants, led by the proletariat. This is a concrete manifestation of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution's "taking the working class as the leader and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation." Our People's Liberation Army is also a production force for national construction. Especially in the past three years, in addition to performing military tasks, it has also participated in national reclamation, farming, afforestation, road construction, water conservancy construction, factory construction, and other production work, truly practicing the provisions of the Common Program that "in peacetime, participate in agricultural and industrial production in a planned way to help the country's construction work." This is the traditional spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army since the "August 1st" Army Day. With this great spirit, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people will always be victorious! Forever glorious!

	But today we must also point out that the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism is frantically expanding its armaments and strengthening its armed forces. They are actively reviving Japanese militarism in Asia and West German Nazism in Europe. They are using the so-called "Atlantic Treaty" to establish a European aggressive army, and are plotting to establish a "Pacific Treaty" to establish an Asian aggressive army. They are attempting to establish a worldwide armed counter-revolutionary alliance to carry out comprehensive armed aggression against the world. In the war of aggression against Korea, US imperialism has used all shameless and deceitful means for a year to hinder the Korean armistice negotiations, slaughter our prisoners of war, and indiscriminately bomb water and electricity equipment related to the peaceful life of the Chinese and Korean people. US imperialism is also inhumanely carrying out germ warfare in Korea and in our Northeast, and recently has been constantly using its air force to invade our country's airspace and its navy to invade our country's territorial waters, provoking the Chinese people in an attempt to expand the war of aggression.

	The Chinese people love peace. We want peace in China, peace in all of Asia, and peace in the whole world. We Chinese people are even more determined to safeguard the security of our motherland and world peace. Our Chinese People's Liberation Army has been tested in twenty-five years of revolutionary struggle. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has been forged in the struggle of "armed revolution against armed counter-revolution." The Chinese people's armed forces have defeated the imperialist armed aggression in the past; they are defeating them now; and they will surely defeat them in the future. We must heighten our vigilance, step up our training, and strengthen our just struggle against aggression, for peace, and to defend our country. Victory and glory will always belong to us!

	Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
	Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
	Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!
	Long live the People's Republic of China!

### 政协全国委员会和各民主党派  为“八一”建军节给中国人民解放军的贺电

    政协全国委员会和各民主党派
    为“八一”建军节给中国人民解放军的贺电中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会毛主席中国人民解放军朱总司令暨全体指挥员战斗员同志们：
    “八一”南昌起义到今天已经二十五周年了。全中国人民都在欢欣鼓舞地迎接着这个光荣的建军节。在这个伟大的节日，我们各民主党派谨向你们致热烈的庆贺和崇高的敬礼！
    “八一”这个伟大的日子为中国的革命开辟了一个新的历史时代。斯大林大元帅在一九二六年曾经指出：“在中国，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命，这是中国革命的特点之一，也是中国革命的优点之一”。一九二七年“八一”南昌起义是中国人民开始创造自己武装革命力量的日子。由于中国人民武装力量的诞生、成长、壮大，中国人民革命获得了今天辉煌的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。中国人民的武装力量不但推翻了国内封建买办法西斯的反动政权，而且彻底结束了帝国主义在中国百余年来的统治。中国人民武装革命的成功证明了帝国主义的武装侵略是可以被击败的，而殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动更有了光明胜利的前途。
    “八一”南昌起义后，中国人民的武装由少数的工农红军，发展壮大，成为今天强大的国防力量。中国人民的武力一贯地发挥着高度的爱国主义和高度的国际主义精神。今天我们不仅有力量保卫我们祖国的安全，并且站在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营中共同担负保卫亚洲和世界和平的任务。这是中国人民解放军的光荣。这是全中国人民的光荣。这种光荣，是革命先烈流血牺牲的结果，是全体革命队伍英勇战斗的结果，是伟大领袖毛主席英明正确领导的结果。
    毛主席所领导的革命武装，不仅是枪炮的武装，还有精神思想上的武装。中国人民的革命队伍从诞生之日起就用马克思列宁主义武装了自己。中国人民的革命队伍是工农人民组成的、无产阶级领导的。这是中国新民主主义革命“以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础”的具体表现。我们的人民解放军也是国家建设的生产队伍，特别最近三年来，除担任军事上的任务外，还参加了国家的垦荒、种地、植林、修路、兴筑水利、建造工厂等等生产工作，真正实践了共同纲领上“在和平时期，有计划地参加农业和工业的生产，帮助国家的建设工作”的规定。这是“八一”建军以来中国人民解放军的传统精神。有了这种伟大的精神，中国人民解放军和中国人民就永远胜利！永远光荣！
    但在今天我们还要指出，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，正在疯狂地扩充军备，加强武装。他们在亚洲积极地恢复日本的军国主义，在欧洲积极地恢复西德的纳粹主义。他们用所谓的“大西洋公约”以建立欧洲侵略军，并阴谋成立“太平洋公约”以建立亚洲侵略军。他们妄图成立全世界武装的反革命大联合，对全世界进行全面武装侵略。美帝国主义在侵略朝鲜的战争中，一年来使用一切无耻欺骗手段，阻碍朝鲜停战谈判，屠杀我战俘，并滥炸有关中朝人民和平生活的水电设备。美帝国主义并灭绝人性地在朝鲜和在我国东北进行着细菌战，最近更不断地用空军侵犯我国的领空，用海军侵犯我国的领海，向中国人民挑衅，以图扩大侵略战争。
    中国人民是爱好和平的。我们要中国的和平，要全亚洲的和平，要全世界的和平。我们中国人民更有坚强的决心保卫我们祖国的安全和世界的和平。我们中国人民解放军是经过了二十五年革命斗争的考验的。中国人民解放军是在“武装的革命反对武装的反革命”斗争中锻炼出来的。对帝国主义的武装侵略，中国人民的武装力量过去曾打败了他们；现在正在打败他们；将来也必定同样地打败他们。我们要提高警惕，加紧锻炼，加强我们反对侵略、争取和平、保家卫国的正义斗争。胜利和光荣永远属于我们！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民解放军朱总司令万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
