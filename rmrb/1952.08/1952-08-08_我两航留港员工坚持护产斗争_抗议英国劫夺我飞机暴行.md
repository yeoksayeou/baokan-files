Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 7th: Our correspondent reports: The British government's use of force to seize our civil aviation aircraft and warehouses in Hong Kong for American imperialist elements, and the persecution of our employees remaining in Hong Kong to protect state property, fully exposes its hostile attitude towards the Chinese people. Our two airlines' employees in Hong Kong resolutely protest against the atrocities of British imperialism and bravely continue the struggle to protect our assets.

The British government's means of seizing this property of our country were extremely brutal. After the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council illegally "awarded" 40 Central Air Transport Corporation aircraft and other assets in Hong Kong to the American swindler Chennault on July 28th, the British government in Hong Kong began its seizure atrocities at midnight on the same day. More than a thousand fully armed British military police launched a surprise attack around 2:00 AM in three routes towards Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport, where our aircraft and materials were stored, as well as the Whampoa Dock and the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, two warehouse areas.

About 500 British military police who raided Kai Tak Airport arrived at the airport in armored vehicles at 1:55 AM, carrying submachine guns, rattan shields, and tear gas, and immediately surrounded the north, south, and east zones of the airport where our aircraft were parked. The British police immediately ordered our employees guarding the area to leave their posts, but the employees, bearing the sacred responsibility of protecting our national property, immediately refused sternly. The British police then used violence against our asset-protecting employees. In the east zone, five or six British police officers dealt with one of our employees, beating and dragging them to push them into police cars. Employees Ye He and Ouyang Duo, among others, were surrounded and beaten by more than ten British police officers, and were bruised all over from head to toe. Our employees immediately pointed out to the British police officers sternly, "We are ordered by the Central People's Government to guard our national property here. We will never leave without orders from superiors!" However, the British superintendent present shouted at our employees barbarously, "I am your superior. I want you to leave this place immediately!" Then he ordered the British police to beat our employees together. For a time, batons rained down, and no one was spared. When the British police surrounded the more than 20 employees living in the office building in the south zone, they all held hands firmly, resolutely refused to leave their posts, and sent representatives to question the British police, "What reason do you have to force us to leave?" But a British superintendent grabbed the hair of this employee representative and said, "There is no reason to talk!" Then all the British police present punched and kicked and used gun barrels to beat our more than 20 employees. Worker Liu Muyang was knocked unconscious on the spot, and Zhu Jinbiao, Wu Tengsheng, and several others were beaten until their heads bled. The British police also pushed our employees one by one towards the top of the stairs, and then pushed them down the stairs, many employees were knocked unconscious and continued to be beaten by the British police. When our employees were finally escorted into police cars by the British police due to their serious injuries, they all shouted the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang the national anthem and "Ode to the Motherland," the magnificent singing resounding throughout Kai Tak Airport. All the employees in the north zone were also subjected to beatings by the British police without exception. After worker Chen Ming was seriously injured, he still shouted, "Comrades, persist in the struggle, we will surely win!" By 3:50 AM, the airport area where our aircraft were parked was completely controlled by the British police by force, and all 160 of our employees in the airport area were illegally arrested by the British police and successively sent to the Kowloon City Police Station for detention.

The warehouse of the China National Aviation Corporation at the old site of Whampoa Dock was simultaneously raided by the British military police in Hong Kong by land and sea. The British police, holding submachine guns, who first entered the door forced the worker on duty to hand over the key to the gate. The worker sternly refused, and a British superintendent beat the worker with the butt of a gun. Then a large number of British police rushed into the warehouse and began a frenzied humiliation and search of the 42 employees inside the warehouse. Many employees' watches and pens were snatched, and even the employee committee's funds of HK$600 were looted. Finally, the British police grabbed 42 employees and put them into police cars, carrying seven or eight people at a time, and escorted them to the Hung Hom Police Station.

Another route of British police raided the warehouse of the China National Aviation Corporation at the old site of the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, numbering about 400 people. They climbed over the wall like robbers and rushed in after opening the gate. Our employees, who were sleeping soundly, were pushed out of the dormitory to an open space outside, without any explanation, and were subjected to bright spotlights shining in their eyes and forcibly searched. Our employees immediately sent representatives to question the British police as to what reason they had to use force to seize our national property and use violence against employees responsible for protecting the property of the motherland. But an unreasonable British superintendent raised his fist and roared, "This is the reason!" and continued to insult our employees. After dawn, our employees, regardless of the British police's obstruction, raised the national flag and sang the national anthem in unison to protest to British imperialism, and unanimously swore to continue to resolutely assume the responsibility of protecting our assets.

After the British government's seizure atrocities occurred, the representatives of the Central Air Transport Corporation and the China National Aviation Corporation in Hong Kong went to see the Commissioner of Police of the British government in Hong Kong, McKerron, at 11:00 AM on the 29th to lodge a strong protest against the above-mentioned incident. The representatives of the two airlines emphasized that our staff members were ordered by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to stay in Hong Kong to protect our assets. They could not accept any orders other than those of the Central People's Government. Now the British government police have dispatched a large number of military police to use force to coerce the staff to leave their posts. The British government should be fully responsible for all the serious consequences caused by this illegal act. However, the British government continued to persecute our 202 arrested employees guarding Kai Tak Airport and the warehouse at the old site of Whampoa Dock by barbaric means. In the police station, the British police drove our employees to open-air places to bask in the sun all day long. When it rained at night, they drove our employees to let the rain wet them and shone bright spotlights in their eyes. They even unreasonably refused to allow our employees' families to send food. However, all our employees responded to all the atrocities of British imperialism with resolute struggle. The British government in Hong Kong was finally forced to release all the Chinese employees it had arrested around 2:00 AM on July 30th.

The British government has now illegally handed over the civil aviation aircraft it seized from our country to American imperialist elements, expressing its respectful loyalty to its American masters in a very thoughtful manner. On the third day after the forced seizure, the British government in Hong Kong issued a special gazette authorizing its Civil Aviation Director and any police officer to use all necessary force to hand over the aircraft to the so-called American "Civil Air Transport." Personnel from the so-called "American Civil Air Transport" have gone to Hong Kong from Taiwan to carry out "takeover" activities. These activities show the ugly state of the British government's slavishness to American imperialism, and at the same time, make people realize how cunning and hateful the British government's conspiracy was to previously acknowledge that these aircraft belonged to China under the protest of our people, while at the same time issuing "detention orders" and condoning Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to explode and sabotage, and finally playing the trick of so-called "property rights litigation" to achieve the purpose of seizure.

Our two airlines' asset-protecting employees who are still in Hong Kong and sticking to their posts feel very angry about the British government's seizure of our aircraft and warehouses in Hong Kong and the atrocities of persecuting them. They pointed out that the British government's action is completely a further specific manifestation of following the United States and adopting a hostile attitude towards our People's Republic of China. All employees unanimously expressed their firm support for the serious protest statement made by Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government regarding this atrocity of the British government; and they are determined to continue to wage an unyielding struggle to protect our national property with the support of the people of the whole country!

    我两航留港员工坚持护产斗争
    抗议英国劫夺我飞机暴行
    【新华社广州七日电】本社记者报道：英国政府用武力替美帝国主义分子劫夺我国在香港的民航飞机和仓库，并迫害我留港保护国家财产的职工的横暴事件充分地暴露其与中国人民为敌的态度。我两航留港职工坚决抗议英帝国主义的暴行，并英勇地继续坚持护产斗争。
    英国政府劫夺我国这一笔财产时，手段极其横暴。英国政府枢密院司法委员会在七月二十八日非法将我留港的中央航空公司飞机四十架及其他资财“判给”美国骗子陈纳德后，香港英国政府在同日午夜就开始其劫夺暴行。全副武装的英国军警千余人，在午夜二时左右分三路向存放着我国飞机和物资的香港启德机场以及庇利船厂和新亚药厂等两个仓库地区举行突袭。
    突袭启德机场的英国军警约五百人，在午夜一时五十五分乘着冲锋车，携带着机关枪、藤牌及催泪弹等到达机场，随即把停放着我国飞机的机场北区、南区和东区团团包围。英警一开始就命令在那里看守的我国员工离开岗位，但负着保护我国家财产的神圣责任的员工们当即严词拒绝。英警于是就向我护产员工横施暴力。在东区，五、六个英警对付我一个员工，连打带拖地要把我员工推上警车。员工叶和及欧阳铎等这时被十多个英警围殴，从头至脚被殴得遍体鳞伤。我员工即严正地向英警指出：“我们奉中央人民政府的命令，在这里看守我们国家的财产，没有上级的命令，我们决不离开！”但在场的英籍帮办却横蛮地指着我员工大叫：“我就是你们的上级，我要你们即刻离开此地！”接着他就下令英警一齐向我员工殴击，一时棍如雨下，无一幸免。南区办公楼上住着的我二十多个员工，当被英警包围时，全体手挽着手，坚决地拒绝离开岗位，并派代表质问英警：“你们凭什么理由迫我们走？”但一个英籍帮办竟一把抓住这个员工代表的头发说：“没有道理讲！”跟着全部在场英警即拳脚交加并用枪杆向我二十多个员工打过来，刘木养工友当场被击晕倒，朱锦标、吴腾生等数人被打得头破血流。英警还将我员工一个个推向梯口，再从梯口连推带打地推下楼梯，许多员工被跌晕倒后还继续受到英警的殴击。当我员工因受伤甚重最后被英警押上警车时，全体一致高呼“毛主席万岁！”的口号和高唱国歌和“歌唱祖国”，雄壮歌声震荡着整个启德机场。在北区的全体员工亦无例外地遭受英警的毒打，工友陈明被打至重伤后，仍高喊：“同志们：坚持斗争下去，我们一定会胜利的！”至三时五十分，我停放飞机的机场区即全部被英警用武力控制，机场区的我员工一百六十人亦全部被英警非法逮捕，并先后被送到九龙城警署拘禁。
    庇利船厂旧址我中国航空公司仓库，与启德机场同时受到香港英国军警水陆两面的突袭。首先进门的拿着冲锋枪的英警逼我值班守卫的工友交出大门的锁匙，这位工友严正拒绝，一个英籍帮办就用枪柄向这个工友殴击；跟着大队的英警就冲进了仓库，对仓库内的四十二个员工开始了疯狂的殴辱和搜劫。许多员工的手表、钢笔被抢走，连那里员工学委会的经费港币六百元也被劫去。最后，英警竟以七、八个人抬一个人，将四十二个员工抓上警车，押往红磡警署。
    另一路突袭新亚药厂旧址我中央航空公司仓库的英警约达四百人。他们像强盗一样爬墙而入，打开大门后，大批英警即蜂拥入内。正在熟睡中的我方员工，不由分说即被英警推到宿舍外面的一个空场上，并被他们用强光的射灯照射眼睛和强行搜身。我员工当即推出代表质问英警有什么理由用武力劫夺我国家财产和暴力对付负责保护祖国财产的员工。但一个蛮不讲理的英籍帮办，竟高举拳头咆哮说：“这就是理由！”并继续对我员工横施侮辱。天亮后，我员工不顾英警的阻止，高升国旗，齐唱国歌，向英帝国主义表示抗议，并全体一致宣誓继续坚决负起护产的责任。
    英国政府劫夺暴行发生后，我中央航空公司和中国航空公司的留港代表即在二十九日上午十一时前往见香港英国政府警务处处长麦景陶，就上述事件提出强硬抗议。两航空公司代表强调指出：我工作人员是奉中华人民共和国中央人民政府之命，留港护产，他们除了中央人民政府的命令之外，其他一切命令概不能接受，而现在英政府警方，竟出动大批军警，用武力胁迫各工作人员脱离岗位，这种非法行为所引起一切严重后果，应由英国政府负其全责。但英国政府反而继续用野蛮手段迫害我被捕的看守启德机场和庇利船厂旧址仓库的二百零二名员工。在警署中，英警白天把我员工逐到露天的地方晒了一整天太阳，晚上下雨，又把我员工赶去让雨淋，并用强光射灯照射眼睛；甚至无理拒绝我员工家属去送食品。但是，我全体员工以坚决的斗争来回答英帝国主义的一切暴行。香港英国政府最后不得不在七月三十日晨二时左右把捕去的我国员工全部释放。
    英国政府现已把劫夺去的我国民航飞机，非法交给美帝国主义分子，十分周到地表示其对美国主子的恭顺效忠。在武力劫夺后的第三天，香港英国政府即发表特别宪报，授权给所属民航处长及任何警察官员得使用一切必要的武力，将这批飞机交给所谓美国“民用航空运输公司”。从八月二日开始，香港英国政府即派出武装警察将存放在前新亚药厂内的中央航空公司的飞机器材和存放在前庇利船厂内的中国航空公司的飞机器材扫数运走。所谓“美国民用航空运输公司”的人员，已从台湾前去香港进行“接收”活动。从这些活动中看到英国政府对美帝国主义的奴颜婢膝的丑态，同时更加使人们认识英国政府以前一面在我国人民抗议下不得不承认这些飞机是中国所有，一面又发布“扣押令”并纵容蒋匪特务爆炸破坏，终于玩弄所谓“产权诉讼”的把戏来达到劫夺目的的阴谋伎俩，是如何狡猾可憎。
    现在仍留香港坚持岗位的我两航空公司护产员工对英国政府劫夺我国留港飞机和仓库，并向他们迫害的暴行感到非常愤怒，他们指出：英国政府的这一行动，完全是追随美国，对我中华人民共和国采取敌视态度的进一步的具体表现。全体职工一致表示坚决拥护中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长就英国政府这一暴行提出的严重抗议声明；并决心在全国人民的支持下，继续为保护我国家财产进行不屈的斗争！
