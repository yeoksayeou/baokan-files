Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 20th. US Senior Liaison Officer McCaslin admitted on the 20th that US aircraft did violate the agreement by flying over the Panmunjom meeting area on August 16th. However, he attempted to deny another incident of US aircraft flying over the meeting area on August 12th. Since August, the US side, disregarding its previous guarantees, has continuously created six incidents of damaging the meeting area, which clearly indicates that the US side is attempting to tear up the agreements between the two sides. At the liaison officers' meeting on the 20th, our senior liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, sternly pointed out: The US side should take thorough measures to address the recent continuous violations of the meeting area. Our side is not satisfied with the US side's existing measures.

Regarding the multiple incidents since August, the US side, unable to deny them, was forced to admit responsibility for four of them. Today, as with each admission, they hypocritically expressed "regret" and claimed that they "will make every effort to ensure that violations of this nature do not occur." However, each time, no sooner were the words spoken than new incidents of violating the agreement immediately occurred. In order to remove a few items from their ugly record of violating the agreement, McCaslin chose the August 12th incident to quibble over. In fact, this incident, like other incidents admitted by the US side, was jointly confirmed by the security officers of both sides. Similarly, the US side groundlessly denied another incident of flying over the meeting area on August 4th. The US side's attempt to use empty denials to whitewash their dishonorable record of violating the agreement will only make it blacker and blacker.

    美方被迫承认十六日美机侵越会场区事件
    【新华社开城二十日电】美方首席联络官麦卡塞二十日承认，八月十六日美机确曾违反协议，飞越板门店会场区，但对八月十二日另一次美机飞越会场区事件却企图抵赖。八月以来，美方不顾自己历次保证，连续制造了六次破坏会场区的事件，这明白表示美方正企图把双方协议加以撕毁。我方首席联络官张春山上校在二十日的联络官会议上严词指出：美方应对最近连续侵犯会场区的事件采取彻底措施，我方对美方的现有措施不能满意。
    对于八月以来的多次事件，美方赖不胜赖，曾被迫承认其中四次的责任。今天也同每次承认时一样，他们虚伪地表示“遗憾”，声言“将尽一切努力以保证此种性质的侵犯事件不致发生”。但是每一次总是言犹在耳，新的破坏协议事件又立刻发生。为了从他们丑恶的破坏协议纪录中减去几个项目，麦卡塞选择了八月十二日的事件进行狡赖。事实上，这次事件也正如美方承认的其他事件一样，是双方安全军官共同确认的。同样，美方对八月四日的另一次飞越会场区事件也毫无道理地抵赖。美方想用空口否认来涂改他们不名誉的破坏协议的纪录，结果只会愈涂愈黑而已。
