Why the Hao Jianxiu Work Method of the State-Owned Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory Cannot Be Consolidated
    Xue Wenguang Li Zihua Li Shumin Zhu Zhirong

    Since the state-owned Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method last September, 80% of the spinning frame operators quickly learned it, and the amount of roller waste also decreased from an average of 148 pounds per shift to 47 pounds. However, since the beginning of this year, not only have the original achievements not been consolidated and improved, but the enthusiasm of workers to learn and implement the Hao Jianxiu Work Method has gradually declined. Since switching to Indian cotton in June, workers have found the cotton difficult to spin and no longer implement the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, with a widespread belief that "the raw cotton is bad, so the Hao Jianxiu Work Method cannot be implemented." Recently, a survey by the North China Textile Administration Bureau of more than 30 frame operators at the factory found that only one person fully implemented the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. As a result, the factory-wide roller waste has increased from an average of just over one pound per person per day to 3.5 pounds.

    Why has this phenomenon occurred? We believe the basic reason is that the factory and workshop cadres have not truly recognized the superiority of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in their thinking, nor the significance of its promotion for increasing production and practicing economy.

    When the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was first promoted last year, some cadres had serious championship-ism thinking, simply pursuing the reduction of roller waste and neglecting ideological and technical education for the workers. Many administrators in the spinning workshop were afraid that their class would produce more roller waste than other classes. When they saw that a worker in their class produced too much roller waste, they would glare at the worker and scold, "Why are you producing so much roller waste? Go back and study!" Some administrators, in order to maintain the model status of their class as having "low roller waste," even condoned the workers' erroneous behavior of discarding and hiding roller waste. Therefore, many workers did not thoroughly learn the Hao Jianxiu Work Method at the time, and some were unwilling to learn because of the cadres' attitude.

    The workshop cadres' thinking is inseparable from the education provided to them by the factory's leading cadres. For example, after the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method was completed, many cadres believed that "the task is over once the promotion is complete," and did not pay attention to the consolidation work after the promotion. Shortly after the promotion work was completed, the "little teachers" were transferred back to participate in production or take on other work; the factory and workshop promotion committees shirked their responsibilities and became mere formalities. Although the trade union also came up with propaganda methods such as the "honor roll," its effect was small because it was not combined with mobilizing and educating the workers. For more than half a year, except for one two-day inspection by a few "little teachers," there has been no in-depth inspection. Recently, in the case of poor raw cotton quality and increased yarn breakage rate, the leading cadres not only failed to resolutely lead the workers to implement the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, but also expressed doubts about the Hao Jianxiu Work Method themselves. Therefore, it has further fueled the workers' reluctance to implement advanced working methods.

    Therefore, we believe that to consolidate the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, we must first ensure that the cadres have sufficient understanding of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. At present, it is even more necessary to mobilize and educate the workers to thoroughly master the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in order to overcome the difficulties caused by the increase in breakage due to poor raw cotton. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational leadership for promoting advanced working methods, and the factory and workshop promotion committees must be strengthened. Thirdly, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological and technical education of workers. Recently, the No. 4 Factory has begun to select several workers to specifically serve as "little teachers," and to carry out practical education to everyone through the model deeds of Wang Shuzhen in adhering to the implementation of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. But this is far from enough and requires continued and redoubled efforts.

    国营天津第四棉纺织厂郝建秀工作法为什么不能巩固
    薛文广  李子华  李淑敏  朱志荣
    国营天津第四棉纺织厂，自去年九月推广郝建秀工作法以后，不久便有百分之八十的细纱挡车工学会了郝建秀工作法，皮辊花也由每班每日平均一百四十八磅降低到四十七磅。但是，今年以来，不但原有成绩没有得到巩固和提高，职工学习和执行郝建秀工作法的热情也逐渐低落。自今年六月份改用印度棉后，工人见花不好纺，更不执行郝建秀工作法了，普遍存在着“原棉不好，不能执行郝建秀工作法”的想法。最近，华北纺织管理局检查组测定了这个厂三十多个挡车工，其中完全执行郝建秀工作法的只有一人。因此全厂皮辊花也由每人每日平均出一磅多，增加到三·五磅。
    为什么产生以上现象呢？我们认为基本的原因是厂和车间干部的思想上还没有真正认识到郝建秀工作法的优越性，及推广它后对增产节约的意义。
    去年开始推广郝建秀工作法时，部分干部存在着严重的锦标主义思想，单纯追求皮辊花数的减少，忽视向职工进行思想教育和技术教育。细纱车间不少管理员，怕自己领导的班比别班皮辊花出得多，见班内那个工人皮辊花出多了，就瞪着眼睛骂工人：“你们为什么出这么多皮辊花，回去研究研究吧！”有些管理员，为保持自己班“皮辊花少”的模范牌子，竟姑息工人丢藏皮辊花的错误行为。因此，许多工人在当时就未彻底学会郝建秀工作法，有的也因为干部抱着这样的态度，而不高兴学习。
    车间干部的这种思想，是和厂的领导干部对他们的教育不能分开的。例如郝建秀工作法推广工作结束后，许多干部认为“推广完了，任务也就完了”，而不重视推广后的巩固工作。推广工作结束后不久，“小先生”都被调回参加生产，或担任其他工作；厂和车间推广委员会，互相推诿责任，形同虚设。虽然，工会也曾想出了“光荣榜”等宣传鼓动的办法，但因为没有和发动教育职工相结合，作用也就很小。半年多以来，除有一次抽几个“小先生”进行了二天检查外，没有深入检查过。最近，在原棉质量不好，纱的断头率增加的情况下，领导干部不但未坚决领导工人执行郝建秀工作法，反而也对郝建秀工作法表示怀疑。因此，也更助长了工人不愿执行先进工作法的情绪。
    因此，我们认为要巩固郝建秀工作法，首先必须使干部对郝建秀工作法有足够的认识，在目前，更要动员与教育职工彻底掌握郝建秀工作法，才能克服因原棉不好而造成断头增加的困难。其次，要加强推广先进工作法的组织领导，厂和车间的推广委员会必须健全起来。再次，要加强职工的思想教育和技术教育工作。最近四厂已开始抽出了几个工人专门担任“小先生”工作，并通过王淑珍坚持执行郝建秀工作法的模范事迹，向大家进行实际教育。但这是很不够的，须继续加倍努力。
