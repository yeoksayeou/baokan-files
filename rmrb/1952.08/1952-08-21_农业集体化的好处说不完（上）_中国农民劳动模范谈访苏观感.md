    The Benefits of Agricultural Collectivization are Endless (Part 1)
    --Chinese Model Farmers Discuss Their Impressions of Visiting the Soviet Union

"The benefits of agricultural collectivization are endless"—this was the common impression that model farmers from the Chinese Farmers Delegation shared with reporters before leaving Moscow to return to China. They gained this impression from visiting many rural areas in Ukraine, the Caucasus, and Kazakhstan.

Li Shunda, a nationally renowned model of high agricultural yield from Shanxi, said:

    "Soviet collectivized agriculture is truly good. The Soviet Union has vast land, and after collectivization, the land is concentrated, allowing for the full utilization of labor and machinery. Judging from the Soviet experience, collectivization requires linking small plots of land into large ones, manufacturing large quantities of machinery, and organizing the labor force. The Soviet Union uses machines for almost the entire farming process. Therefore, collective farmers don't have to work from dawn to dusk like our farmers. Their labor is not strenuous, but their harvests are abundant. They have clubs, libraries, nurseries, and kindergartens. Everyone rests on Sundays. Their homes have electric lights, radios, and some have cars and telephones. This happy life is brought about by agricultural collectivization.

    Our agricultural production cooperatives will further develop into collective farms. We must tell our farmers more about the benefits of collectivization. We must run our agricultural production cooperatives well, accumulate more public property, and make good use of new farm implements. We must establish the idea of collectivization among the broad masses of farmers, and at the same time develop industry to manufacture agricultural machinery. Our agriculture must guarantee sufficient raw materials for industry, and industry will supply agriculture with machinery, starting with a large number of new and simple farm implements that China can use today.

    This visit has resolved some ideological issues and learned some agricultural techniques. Our area has many mountains and little land. We have been contemplating how to open up the road to developing production. After the visit, we learned that developing diversified economies and using methods of fixed labor quotas with rewards for exceeding them can develop production. Regarding pasture crop rotation, we initially doubted whether planting pasture on good land would be wasting the land, and whether we could use this method with our limited land. Later, we learned that in Ukraine, if the land is not left fallow and rotated, one mu (approximately 0.16 acres) can only yield 240 jin (approximately 265 lbs) of wheat per year. However, using fallow and pasture rotation to improve soil fertility can yield 467 jin (approximately 515 lbs) per mu. Moreover, fallow land and pasture land save labor, and planting pasture can develop animal husbandry, while livestock can supply the fields with fertilizer, supply industry with hides and furs, and supply people with meat and milk. Knowing these benefits has dispelled our doubts. Our agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative has already formulated a three-year plan. This year, we planted ten mu of pasture and bought fifty sheep, and one head each of cattle, horses, and donkeys. This is just the beginning. In the future, we will improve 'tiao cha' (a traditional farming technique) in a more planned way. Seeing the water conservancy in the Soviet countryside reminded us that even small mountain gullies in our area, with a little artificial work, can be dammed to form reservoirs for irrigation and fish farming.

    The Soviet people, regardless of their age or gender, treated us like family. Although we didn't speak the same language, they were very warm. Everywhere, people presented us with flowers and the most precious gifts—bread, salt, and fatty meat. One piece of bread was so large that two people couldn't lift it. Many responsible cadres from collective farms, machine tractor stations, state farms, and agricultural science research institutions patiently explained all the issues to us. They said: 'Every bit of experience, no matter how small, must be told to you without omission, so that you can take it back to build a new China.' This deeply moved us."

Geng Changsuo, the leader of the "Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative" in Hebei, which has won the national title of model of comprehensive high yield, said:

    "The benefits of Soviet collectivized agriculture are endless. We are often threatened by drought and floods. But in the Soviet Union, slopes are not dry, and depressions are not flooded. Good crops grow everywhere because the Soviet Union does not rely on the weather. The great Stalin Plan for the Transformation of Nature is changing the climate. Windbreaks, field protection forest belts, canals, and artificial rain keep the soil adequately moist. We have seen this with our own eyes.

    In Ukraine, where we visited, collective farms with 10,000 to 20,000 mu of land are considered small, and those with 100,000 to 200,000 mu are common. We saw tractors and combine harvesters doing work that is incomparably more efficient than manual labor. A 'Stalin-80' tractor, with two five-bottom plows, can plow 450 mu of land in one day to a depth of nine inches, with only two or three people. In our area, the same amount of land would require 150 people, 150 cattle, 150 plows, and 30 harrows to plow 450 mu in one day, and only to a depth of four inches. If we wanted to plow nine inches deep, it would require twice the manpower and animal power. A 'Stalin-80' tractor, with two combine harvesters, can harvest and thresh wheat on 900 mu of land in one day, and also eliminate pests, with a total of 14 people including the harvester operator and three truck drivers. In our area, the same amount of land would require 360 people to harvest wheat, 120 people and 60 cattle and 60 carts to haul the wheat to the threshing ground, 180 people and 60 cattle to thresh the wheat, and 180 people and 180 cattle and 180 plows to eliminate pests. After collectivization and mechanization, labor efficiency has increased more than tenfold.

    The life of collective farmers is truly enviable. They eat bread, meat, and milk. On Sundays, they wear either serge or silk. They sleep on wire beds. Their houses have running water, electric lights, radios, and complete sets of cabinets, tables, and chairs. Every collective farm has a club, a library, a radio relay station, and a movie theater. Collective farmers sing while they work. There is no phenomenon of people exploiting people. Everyone is very happy. This kind of life can only be achieved through collectivization. After seeing it, it is truly enviable. We must strive to achieve this kind of life in China. First, farmers must recognize these benefits and work together.

    We learned many things from this visit. For example: there are fixed quotas for work, with rewards for exceeding the quotas and deductions for failing to meet them. Nurseries are paid for by the collective farm, giving full play to the strength of women. We also learned about the experience of high corn yields. In Ukraine, corn yields can reach 2,773 jin per mu, and generally around 1,000 jin. Our agricultural production cooperative only yields 326 jin per mu. Ukrainian collective farmers increase corn yields by deep plowing, using corn stalks to accumulate snow in winter, applying fertilizer more often, and artificial pollination. We can use their experience as soon as we get back.

    When we arrived in the Soviet Union, we felt even more the strength of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. We were warmly received everywhere. Wherever we went, we were surrounded by the enthusiasm of the Soviet people."

Han En, the leader of the "Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative" in Jilin, said:

    "We saw that in the collectivized Soviet countryside, land had been consolidated from small plots into large ones. The state's machine tractor stations used machinery to cultivate the land for collective farmers. Mechanization has greatly reduced labor, and many women participate in production. It is common for old women to earn more than 500 labor days a year. Barren land also produces good crops. Foxes are also raised as domestic animals. Water that used to flow away for nothing can now be used to generate electricity. Collective farmers do not eat from a common pot, but rather distribute the fruits of their labor according to their work. More work means more income, with rewards for exceeding quotas. Each collective farmer family also has its own private plot and a certain number of livestock.

    Seeing the Soviet countryside, we feel that our path is broad. Our agricultural production cooperative is a preliminary form of collectivization. Soviet collective farms developed from nothing, from small to large. The Soviet Union's road today is our road tomorrow. We came here as students and learned many good things. We must redouble our efforts when we return. As long as everyone works hard, then Soviet collectivized agriculture is not far from us.

    When we participated in the May Day celebration in Moscow, the marchers held high Chairman Mao's image and threw flowers at us. During our visits to various places, Soviet friends patiently told us all of their experiences."

Jin Shilong, the leader of the "Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative" in Jilin, which has won the national title of model of comprehensive high yield, said:

    "The Soviet Union's experience in agricultural collectivization tells us that the transition from a dispersed, individual small-peasant economy to collective agriculture requires many conditions. First, there must be the correct policies of the Party. Second, there must be national industrialization, with industry supplying the agricultural machinery needed for collectivization. Third, there must be state guidance and assistance, such as through state farms and machine tractor stations demonstrating large-scale production, the use of machinery, and advanced scientific farming methods to farmers.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we must study the Soviet Union's experience in agricultural collectivization and, based on China's specific circumstances, gradually collectivize our agriculture. China must first develop industry, and at the same time run agricultural production cooperatives well. In agricultural production cooperatives, we must formulate practical regulations, formulate various work quotas and workpoint calculation methods, improve labor organization, and develop diversified economies. We must first run agricultural production cooperatives well and promote them, and then, in a prepared and step-by-step manner, develop them into collective farms.

    This time, I deeply felt the high spirit of internationalism of the Soviet people. They frequently asked about China's construction, farmers' lives, the Korean War, and the situation of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Wherever we went, we received warm welcomes and receptions, and even young children waved to us. Their naturally expressed emotions moved us very much."

    农业集体化的好处说不完（上）
    ——中国农民劳动模范谈访苏观感
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　李何
    “农业集体化的好处说不完”——中国农民代表参观团中的劳动模范在离莫斯科返国之前向记者谈了他们这个共同观感。这个观感是他们这次参观乌克兰、高加索和哈萨克的许多农村得来的。
    全国著名的农业丰产模范山西的李顺达说：
    “苏联集体化的农业真好。苏联地大，经过集体化之后，把土地集中起来，能够充分地使用劳动力和机器。从苏联的经验看来，要集体化就要把小块土地联成大块，要制造大批机器，要把劳动力组织起来。苏联差不多整个农作过程都用机器。所以集体农民不像我们农民那样从天亮劳动到天黑。他们劳动不繁重，收获却很多。他们有俱乐部、图书馆、托儿所、幼儿园。星期天大家休息。他们家里有电灯、收音机，有些有汽车、电话。这种幸福生活，是农业集体化带给的。
    我们的农业生产合作社再进一步发展就是集体农场。我们要把集体化的好处多多告诉自己的农民。我们要办好农业生产合作社，多多积累公共财产，好好使用新式农具。我们要在广大农民中树立集体化思想，同时要发展工业，制造农业机器。我们的农业要保证给工业足够的原料，而工业将供给农业以机器，首先是大批今天中国就可以用的新式简单农具。
    这次参观解决了思想上的一些问题，学得了一些农艺经验。我们那里山多地少，我们曾经盘算怎样打开发展生产的道路。参观以后，知道用发展多种经济和劳动有定额，超额有奖励的办法，可以发展生产。对于牧草作物轮种制，我们在开始时怀疑把好地种牧草，是不是辜负了土地，我们地少能不能用这种方法。后来知道在乌克兰土地如果不休闲和不轮种，一市亩一年只打二百四十市斤麦子，用休闲和轮种牧草来改换地力的，一亩能打四百六十七斤麦子；而且休闲地和牧草地省工，同时种牧草可以发展养畜业，而牲畜又可以供给田地以肥料，供给工业以皮毛，供给人以肉和乳。知道了这些好处，我们的怀疑打消了。我们的农林畜牧生产合作社已经订了三年计划，今年种了十亩牧草，买了五十只羊，牛、马、驴各一头。这是开始。以后还要更有计划地改进‘调槎’。看见苏联农村的水利，想起我们那里小山壑稍施人工，也可以堵成蓄水池来灌溉和养鱼。
    苏联人民不论男女老幼，待我们都像亲人一样。虽然语言不通，但亲热得很。处处人们献给我们鲜花和最贵重的礼物——面包、盐和肥肉。有一块面包大得两个人都端不动。许多集体农场、机器拖拉机站、国家农场、农业科学研究机关的负责干部对我们耐心地讲解一切问题，他们说：‘有一点一滴经验，都要毫不遗漏地告诉你们，好叫你们带回去建设新中国。’这使我们十分感动。”
    获得全国全面丰产模范称号的“耿长锁农业生产合作社”的领导人河北的耿长锁说：
    “苏联集体化农业的好处说不完。我们那里常受旱涝的威胁。但在苏联，坡地不旱，洼地不涝，都长得好庄稼。因为苏联不靠天吃饭。伟大的斯大林改造自然计划改变着气候。防风护田林带、水渠和人造雨，使土壤保有充足水分。这是我们亲眼见到的。
    我们到过的乌克兰，那里集体农场有土地一两万亩的算小的，有一、二十万亩的很平常。我们看到了拖拉机和联合收割机做着比人工效率高得不可比拟的工作。一辆“斯大林八十号”拖拉机，带两个五铧犁，用两三个人一天耕四百五十亩地，深达九寸。同样大的地，在我们那里，要用一百五十个人、一百五十头牛、一百五十付犁、三十付耙，一天才能耕四百五十亩地，而且只能耕四寸深；如果要耕九寸深，还要加一倍的人力和畜力。一辆“斯大林八十号”拖拉机，带两辆联合收割机，一天能在九百亩的土地上收麦打麦，附带灭?，收割机手连三辆运输汽车司机等共用十四个人。同样大的地，在我们那里，割麦时得用三百六十个人，把麦拉到打麦场得用一百二十个人和六十头牛、六十辆车，打麦得用一百八十个人、六十头牛、灭?得用一百八十个人、一百八十头牛和一百八十副犁。集体化和机械化以后，劳动效率何止提高十倍。
    集体农民的生活真是令人羡慕。他们吃的是面包、肉、牛奶，星期天穿的不是哔叽就是绸子，睡的是钢丝床，房子里有自来水、电灯、收音机，柜橱桌椅齐备。每个集体农场都有俱乐部、图书馆、无线电转播站、电影场。集体农民一面工作一面唱歌。那里没有人剥削人的现象，大家都很快乐。这种生活只有集体化才能得来。看了之后，真使人羡慕。我们一定要努力争取这种生活在中国实现。这先要农民大伙认识这种好处，携起手来干。
    这次学习到许多东西。比如：工作有定额，超额的有奖励报酬，不足定额的扣减报酬。托儿所归集体农场公家负担，把妇女力量发挥出来。我们也学到玉蜀黍丰产的经验。乌克兰玉蜀黍有一亩产二千七百七十三斤的，一般也产一千斤左右。我们农业生产合作社每亩只产三百二十六斤。乌克兰的集体农民是用深耕、冬天利用玉蜀黍秆积雪、多施一次肥和人工受粉的办法来提高玉蜀黍产量的。他们的经验，我们带回去就可以用。
    我们到了苏联，更感觉到中苏两国人民友谊的牢固。我们到处受到热情招待，到那里去都在苏联人的热情的包围中。”
    吉林“韩恩农业生产合作社”的领导人韩恩说：
    “我们看到集体化了的苏联农村，土地都由小块联成了大块，有国家的机器拖拉机站用机器替集体农民耕作。机械化使劳动大大减轻，妇女参加生产的很多，老太太一年得五百多个劳动日报酬的是常事。歹地也长出好庄稼，狐狸也养成家畜，以前白白流走的水现在也可用来发电。集体农民并不吃什么大锅饭，而是按劳动分果实，多劳多得，超额的给奖励。每户集体农民还有自己的宅旁园圃和一定数目的家畜。
    一看苏联农村，就觉得我们的道路是广阔的。我们的农业生产合作社就是初步的集体化。苏联的集体农场是由无到有，由小到大。苏联今天的道路，就是我们明天的道路。我们这次来当学生，学到了许多好东西，回去要加倍努力。只要大家努力，那么苏联的集体化农业离我们是不远的。
    我们参加莫斯科五一节典礼的时候，游行的人们高举着毛主席的像，并把花掷给我们。我们在各地参观时，苏联朋友都是耐心地把他们的经验全部告诉我们。”
    获得全国全面丰产模范称号的“金时龙农业生产合作社”的领导人吉林的金时龙说：
    “苏联农业集体化的经验告诉我们：由分散的个体的小农经济到集体经营的农业，需要许多条件。第一是党的正确政策。第二是国家工业化，由工业供应集体化所需要的农业机器。第三是国家的指导和帮助，如通过国家农场和拖拉机站在大规模生产、使用机器和先进科学耕作方法方面给农民示范。
    我们要在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，研究苏联农业集体化的经验，根据中国具体情况，把我们农业逐步地集体化起来。中国目前首先要发展工业，同时要办好农业生产合作社。在农业生产合作社里要制定切合实际的章程，制定各种工作定额和计工办法，改善劳动组织，发展多种经济。我们首先把农业生产合作社办好、推广，然后有准备有步骤地发展到集体农场。
    这次深深地感到苏联人民的高度国际主义精神。他们经常询问中国建设、农民生活、朝鲜战争和中国人民志愿军的情况。每到一个地方，我们都受到热烈的欢迎和招待，连小娃娃都向我们招手。他们自然地流露的感情，使我们非常感动。”
