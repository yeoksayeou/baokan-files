Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 8th: The representatives of the United States, Britain, France, Canada, and Japan met in Washington on July 28th to discuss Far Eastern trade issues, particularly trade with the People's Republic of China.

	It is evident from press reports that the United States, which initiated this conference, intends to establish a kind of "international" control system to control trade between the People's Republic of China and countries dependent on the United States. This control is, in effect, an economic blockade against China, preventing these countries from engaging in any trade with China, particularly hindering Japanese business circles from expanding trade with China. The United States plans to force Japan to accept an agreement compelling it to violate its own interests by not trading with China. Moreover, the United States intends to shift Japanese exports to Southeast Asian countries to push British goods out of the Southeast Asian market.

	The American plan has met with opposition from Britain, because Britain is very afraid of Japanese goods competing with it in Southeast Asia. Britain's refusal to allow Japan to participate in the so-called "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade" demonstrates this sentiment, because if Japan were to participate in this agreement, Japan would enjoy "most-favored-nation" rights, making it impossible for Britain to take special protectionist measures to deal with Japanese competition.

	The Washington conference reflects the sharpening contradictions between Britain and Japan, and between Britain and the United States, in the Far East.

    美国在华盛顿五国会议上受到反对
    英日和英美的矛盾更趋尖锐
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社纽约八日讯：美国、英国、法国、加拿大与日本的代表七月二十八日在华盛顿开会，讨论远东的贸易问题，特别是与中华人民共和国的贸易问题。
    从报上的消息显然可以看出，发起这次会议的美国，是想建立一种“国际的”管制制度，控制中华人民共和国与依靠美国的国家之间的贸易，这种控制实际上就是对于中国实行经济封锁，阻止这些国家对中国进行任何贸易，特别是要阻止日本工商界扩大对于中国的贸易。美国打算迫使日本接受一种协定，强迫它违反本国的利益，不与中国贸易。而且美国还打算把日本的输出转到东南亚各国，为的是要把英国货排出东南亚市场。
    美国的计划受到英国的反对，因为英国很害怕日货在东南亚和它竞争。英国不准日本参加所谓“关税与贸易一般协定”，表现了这种心情，因为假若日本参加了这个协定，日本就享有“最惠国”的权利，使英国无法采取特别的保护措施来对付日本的竞争。
    华盛顿会议反映了英日与英美在远东矛盾的更趋尖锐化。
