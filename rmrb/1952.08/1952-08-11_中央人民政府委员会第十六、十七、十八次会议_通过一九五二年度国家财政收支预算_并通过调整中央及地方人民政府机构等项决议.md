Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The 16th, 17th, and 18th meetings of the Central People's Government Committee were held on August 6th, 7th, and 8th, respectively.

	The 16th meeting listened to and approved the report by Bo Yibo, Minister of Finance of the Central People's Government, on the implementation of the 1951 national budget and the compilation of the 1952 national budget draft, and adopted the 1952 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget. Regarding the implementation of the 1951 national budget, Minister Bo pointed out in his report: The 1951 national budget was prepared under the circumstances of large-scale aggression against Korea by American imperialism, the occupation of our territory Taiwan, and direct threats to the security of mainland China. At that time, it had been less than a year since the national financial work implemented unified leadership and unified management, and financial strength could not yet balance revenue and expenditure; the state could not yet fully guarantee the supply of essential goods for people's lives; and the prices that had just stabilized were in danger of fluctuating again. Therefore, in preparing the 1951 national budget, it was necessary to start from the worst possible situation the country might encounter, with the basic principles of ensuring national defense needs, stabilizing prices, and striving for improvement in the financial and economic situation. However, our country's financial and economic strength, based on the movement to resist America and aid Korea, the land reform movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the restoration and transformation of the people's economy, has developed forward at an unprecedented speed. Especially after the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements this year, the results of the implementation and accounting of the 1951 national budget showed a situation far better than originally expected: not only was revenue and expenditure balanced, but there was also a surplus, and in terms of expenditure, in addition to fully ensuring national defense needs, great efforts were made to stabilize prices. The Central People's Government took decisive steps to further implement the appropriation and settlement system in cash management following the cash management measures of 1950, and effectively controlled and managed grain, cotton cloth, and certain important industrial raw materials related to the people's livelihood, and organized urban and rural material exchanges throughout the country. Thanks to these rational measures, the national market basically achieved stability in 1951 despite the Korean War. More funds were allocated for the restoration and transformation of the economy and cultural undertakings than in 1950, thereby accelerating the speed of economic and cultural restoration and transformation. Due to the growth of national economic strength, people's lives have improved, and people's purchasing power has also greatly increased.

	When speaking about the compilation of the 1952 national budget, Minister Bo Yibo pointed out: We already have experience in simultaneously conducting the war to resist America and aid Korea, stabilizing prices, and carrying out key construction, and we have achieved the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Based on this, the basic principle for compiling the 1952 national budget is: to continue to consolidate national defense, stabilize prices, and carry out comprehensive restoration and key construction. The 1952 budget revenue will increase by 41.66 percent compared to the actual revenue in 1951, and the 1952 budget expenditure will increase by 55.52 percent compared to the actual expenditure in 1951. Minister Bo Yibo then used various specific facts and figures to illustrate that the total revenue and total expenditure of the 1952 national budget had been completely balanced during compilation. Minister Bo Yibo said: This is the most favorable situation that has emerged in our country since the establishment of the Central People's Government under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. Production recovery, balanced revenue and expenditure, and stable prices mark a fundamental improvement in our country's financial and economic situation. We have completed ahead of schedule the instructions put forward by Chairman Mao in his report to the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 6, 1950, namely: "To achieve a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, three conditions are required: (1) the completion of land reform; (2) the reasonable adjustment of existing industry and commerce; (3) a substantial reduction in the expenses required by state institutions. To achieve these three conditions, a considerable amount of time is required, approximately three years, or even a little more. The entire Party and the people of the whole country should strive to create these three conditions." Because we have completed Chairman Mao's instructions ahead of schedule in the past two years, we have laid a good foundation for our country's large-scale economic construction in the future. This year, national construction work is being carried out under even more favorable conditions, that is, on the basis of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the movement to increase production and practice economy. We believe that even better situations will emerge in the future.

	Minister Bo Yibo pointed out that the reasons why we were able to achieve such great achievements are, first, the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the various policies stipulated by the Central People's Government, as well as the joint efforts of all parties; second, the implementation of democratic reforms in various enterprises; third, based on the great victories of the war to resist America and aid Korea, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and peasants has been unprecedentedly high, and a patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy has been launched; fourth, the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union.

	Minister Bo Yibo also pointed out in his report that there are still serious shortcomings in financial and economic work, namely: (1) There is insufficient estimation of the potential capacity of our country's existing financial and economic resources and the speed of their development. In terms of the target figures of the revenue plan, whether in terms of taxation or in terms of enterprise production and profit plans, the planned target figures are always set too low, not keeping up with actual development, and are often broken by the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. This is due to insufficient estimation of the enthusiasm and creativity that the victorious people—especially the working class and the peasantry—can unleash under the superior people's democratic system and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, thus sticking to conventions and not daring to move forward, which must be combated. (2) The financial supervision system has not been strictly implemented, financial discipline is lax, some organs have departmentalism, conceal from the state, and fail to hand over the funds that should be handed over, while others use the money they receive inappropriately or not at all. (3) There is a lack of good control and leadership over basic construction projects. From financial and economic leading organs at all levels to factory and mine leaders, the important link of basic construction is neglected. Many basic construction plans, designs, and construction tasks are blindly entrusted to old technical personnel who have not been reformed, which has caused incalculable waste. In order to meet the high tide of economic construction, striving to tap the potential economic strength, opposing conservative tendencies, establishing a financial supervision system, opposing departmentalism, and strengthening the leadership of basic construction are the main keys to whether the national budget for 1952 can be correctly implemented, and efforts must be made to achieve it.

	In concluding his report, Minister Bo Yibo said with confidence: We firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, on the basis of the three major movements, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the movement to increase production and practice economy, and with the efforts of the people of the whole country, we will surely be able to victoriously complete and exceed the various target figures stipulated in the 1952 national budget, and establish a good foundation for large-scale economic construction in the future. However, he also pointed out that while implementing the increase production and practice economy movement, it is necessary to pay close attention to the safety, health, and indispensable welfare of employees. If only the former is paid attention to and the latter is forgotten, that is wrong. Precisely in this aspect, we have shortcomings that must be corrected.

	After Minister Bo Yibo's report, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Committee Member Cheng Qian, Committee Member Huang Yanpei, Committee Member Fu Zuoyi, Committee Member Ma Xulun, Committee Member Shen Junru, Committee Member Ma Yinchu, Committee Member Zhang Bojun, Committee Member Guo Moruo, Committee Member Situ Meitang, Committee Member Zhang Zhizhong, Committee Member Xu Teli, and Committee Member Fu Dingyi of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who attended the meeting, spoke one after another, expressing their excitement and admiration for the fundamental improvement in our country's financial and economic situation in just two or three years, achieving the goals of consolidating national defense, stabilizing prices, comprehensive restoration, and key construction. They unanimously believed that the main reason why our country has achieved such great achievements in all aspects should be attributed to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. Vice Chairman Li Jishen said: The 1952 national revenue and expenditure budget proposed by Minister Bo Yibo demonstrates that the People's Republic of China loves peace and is powerful in defending peace. Committee Member Cheng Qian said: The basic principle for compiling the 1952 national revenue and expenditure budget is in line with the requirements of the general public and the direction is completely correct, which lays a solid foundation for large-scale construction in the future. Committee Member Huang Yanpei said: In the past, we were a country riddled with holes, but after the people stood up, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, we have achieved great achievements in all aspects in a very short period of time, which is a miracle. In order to adapt to the rapid development of our country's economic and cultural undertakings, all departments should be closely connected under the overall plan to avoid blindness. Committee Member Fu Zuoyi said: Financial abundance, balanced revenue and expenditure, and stable prices are the first time in Chinese history. The budget proposed this time is a budget for the development of production, a budget for the happiness of the people, and a budget for the guarantee of peace. Committee Member Ma Xulun said: The great strength of the Chinese people is fully demonstrated in Minister Bo's report and the 1952 national fiscal revenue and expenditure budget. Committee Member Shen Junru said: The great achievements we have made in all aspects demonstrate the superiority of the people's democratic regime. I hope that the people of the whole country will unite, especially the cultural and educational workers and intellectuals, to respond to Chairman Mao's call, carry out self-reform, in order to better struggle for the construction of the country. Committee Member Ma Yinchu said: The main reasons why we have been able to achieve such great achievements in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects are correct leadership, proper command, capable cadres, and popular support. Committee Member Zhang Bojun said: Minister Bo Yibo's report is a great education for the people of the whole country, especially for the people of the democratic parties. It makes us more trusting in the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. Committee Member Guo Moruo said: It is a great joy and worth celebrating to complete Chairman Mao's instructions ahead of schedule. Only in a people's country can we concentrate the strength of all aspects for construction, which will inevitably guarantee the victory over the enemy and safeguard world peace. Committee Member Situ Meitang said: As an overseas Chinese who has lived abroad for a long time, I feel very excited. The leaping progress of the motherland in all aspects will inevitably be supported by millions of patriotic overseas Chinese, and I sincerely congratulate the powerful motherland. Committee Member Zhang Zhizhong said: Such reports and budgets have never been heard of during the Kuomintang rule, and no one in Chinese history could do it, but under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, we have completely achieved a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, which can only make people excited and admire. Committee Member Xu Teli said: In the future development of enterprise production, attention should be paid to the increase of actual wages and the widespread implementation of labor insurance, which will guarantee the lives of the broad masses of workers and enable them to devote themselves to the public wholeheartedly. Committee Member Fu Dingyi said: In addition to sincerely thanking Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, educators must strive to cultivate talents and serve the construction of the country.

	The 17th meeting listened to the report on the work in Northeast China by Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, the report on the work in Northwest China by Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and the report on the work in East China by Chen Yi, Committee Member of the East China Military and Political Committee. After listening to the explanation by Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, the meeting approved the "Decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on the Unified Method for Concluding Treaties, Agreements, Protocols, Contracts, etc., with Foreign Countries." After listening to the explanation by Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture of the Central People's Government, the meeting approved the "Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic" and the "Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Bulgaria." After listening to the explanation by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, the meeting passed the "Resolution on Adjusting the Structure of the Central People's Government" and the "Resolution on Adjusting the Structure of Local People's Governments." In addition, various appointment and removal lists were also passed and approved.

    中央人民政府委员会第十六、十七、十八次会议
    通过一九五二年度国家财政收支预算
    并通过调整中央及地方人民政府机构等项决议
    【新华社十日讯】中央人民政府委员会第十六次会议、第十七次会议、第十八次会议，分别在八月六日、七日、八日举行。
    第十六次会议听取和批准了中央人民政府财政部薄一波部长所作的关于一九五一年度国家预算的执行情况及一九五二年度国家预算草案编成的报告，并通过了一九五二年度国家财政收支预算。关于一九五一年度国家预算的执行情况，薄部长在报告中指出：一九五一年度国家预算，是在美帝国主义大举侵略朝鲜、侵占我国领土台湾、直接威胁中国大陆安全的情况下编制的。那时，全国财政工作实行统一领导与统一管理还不到一年，财政力量还不能平衡收支；国家还不能对人民生活的主要必需品完全保证供应；刚刚稳定下来的物价，还有重新波动的危险。因此，在编制一九五一年度国家预算时，曾不能不从国家可能遭遇到的最坏的情况出发，而以确实保证国防需要、稳定物价与力争财政经济情况好转为基本方针。但是我们国家的财政经济力量，在抗美援朝运动、土地改革运动、镇压反革命运动及人民经济恢复与改造的基础上，却以空前的速度向前发展着。尤其是经过今年“三反”“五反”的伟大运动，使得一九五一年度国家预算执行和核算的结果，出现了远比原来预计良好的情况：收支不仅平衡，而且还有结余，在支付上除完全保证了国防需要外，曾以极大的力量稳定了物价。中央人民政府以坚决的步骤，在现金管理方面继一九五○年现金管理的措施进一步地实现了划拨清算制，对关系人民生计的粮食、纱布及某些重要工业原料，又切实地加以掌握与管理，并在全国范围内组织了城乡物资交流，由于这些合理措施，一九五一年全国市场虽在朝鲜作战情况下，基本上做到平稳。并在恢复与改造经济及文化事业方面拨付了比一九五○年更多的资金，从而也就加速了经济及文化事业的恢复与改造的速度。由于国家经济力量的增长，人民生活已有所改善，人民购买力也有很大的提高。
    薄一波部长在说到一九五二年度国家预算的编制时，指出：我们已经有了抗美援朝、稳定物价及重点建设同时进行的经验，以及取得了“三反”“五反”的伟大胜利。在这一基础之上，编制一九五二年度国家预算的基本方针是：继续巩固国防、稳定物价、并进行全面恢复和重点建设。一九五二年预算收入比一九五一年实际收入将增加百分之四十一点六六，一九五二年预算支出比一九五一年实际支出将增加百分之五十五点五二。薄一波部长接着以各种具体事实及数字，说明一九五二年度国家预算的总收入及总支出在编制时已经完全达到平衡。薄一波部长说：这是中央人民政府成立以来我们国家在毛主席的英明领导下所出现的最有利的情况。生产恢复、收支平衡、物价稳定，标志着我国财政经济情况已根本好转。我们已经提前完成了毛主席在一九五○年六月六日中共中央七届三中全会报告中所提出的指示，即：“要获得财政经济情况的根本好转，需要三个条件，即：（一）土地改革的完成；（二）现有工商业的合理调整；（三）国家机构所需经费的大量节减。要争取这三个条件，需要相当的时间，大约需要三年时间，或者还要多一点。全党和全国人民均应为创造这三个条件而努力奋斗。”由于两年以来，我们提前完成了毛主席的指示，就给我国今后大规模的经济建设奠定了良好的基础。而今年则是在更有利的条件下进行国家建设的工作，即是在“三反”“五反”运动和增产节约运动的基础上进行的，我们相信：今后会有更好的情况出现。
    薄一波部长指出，我们能够获得这样巨大成绩的原因，首先是毛主席的领导和中央人民政府所规定的各项政策的正确，以及各方面的共同努力；第二是各企业实行了民主改革；第三是在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命，以及“三反”“五反”运动的伟大胜利基础之上，广大工农群众的生产积极性空前高涨，开展了爱国增产节约运动；第四是苏联的无私的帮助。
    薄一波部长在报告中也指出了在财经工作中还存在着的严重缺点，那就是：（一）对于我们国家现有财政经济的潜在能力及其发展的速度估计不足，在收入计划的指标数字上，不论在税收方面或在企业生产及利润的计划方面，计划指标数字总是打的偏低的，赶不上实际的发展，常常被群众的积极性与创造性所打破。这是由于对胜利了的人民——特别是工人阶级和农民阶级，在优越的人民民主制度下，在毛主席和共产党领导下，所能发挥出来的积极性与创造性估计不足，因而墨守成规，不敢前进，必须与之作斗争。（二）没有严格地实行财政监督制度、财政纪律松弛，某些机关有本位主义，对国家隐瞒，该上缴的款不上缴，有的则是领到钱之后，该用而不用。（三）对于基本建设工程没有很好地掌握与领导。从各级财经领导机关直至厂矿负责人对基本建设这一重要环节是忽视的，许多基本建设的计划、设计、施工任务，是盲目地依靠没有经过改造的旧技术人员去做，这就造成了不可计算的浪费。为了迎接经济建设的高潮，努力发掘经济的潜在力量、反对保守倾向，树立财政监察制度、反对本位主义，加强基本建设的领导，是一九五二年能否正确实现国家预算的主要关键，必须力争其实现。
    薄一波部长在结束报告时，充满信心地说：我们深信：在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，在三大运动、“三反”“五反”运动和增产节约运动的基础上，在全国人民的努力下，必能胜利地完成并超过一九五二年度国家预算所规定的各项指标数字，为今后大规模的经济建设树立良好的基础。但他同时指出，在实施增产节约的同时，必须十分注意职工的安全、健康和必不可少的福利，如果只注意前一方面，忘记后一方面，那是不对的，恰恰我们在这一方面是有缺点的，必须力予纠正。
    在薄一波部长报告以后，李济深副主席、程潜委员、黄炎培委员、傅作义委员、马叙伦委员、沈钧儒委员、马寅初委员、章伯钧委员、郭沫若委员、司徒美堂委员、张治中委员、徐特立委员以及列席会议的中国人民政协全国委员会符定一委员均相继发言，对我们国家在短短的二三年时间内，财政经济情况就能以根本好转，做到巩固国防、稳定物价、全面恢复、重点建设，都表示感奋与赞佩，一致认为我们国家在各方面能够获得如此巨大的成绩，主要应该感谢毛主席和中国共产党的领导。李济深副主席说：薄一波部长所提出的一九五二年度国家收支概算，正显示了中华人民共和国是爱好和平而且有力保卫和平的。程潜委员说：编制一九五二年度国家收支概算的基本方针，正合乎现在一般人民的要求，方向也是完全正确的，这就为将来的大规模建设打下了巩固的基础。黄炎培委员说：过去，我们是百孔千疮的国家，但在人民站起来之后，在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，在很短的时间之内，就在各方面都取得了伟大成就，这是一个奇迹。为了适应我们国家经济、文化事业的急速发展，各部门应在总的计划下密切联系，避免盲目性。傅作义委员说：财政丰裕、收支平衡、物价稳定是中国有史以来的第一次。这次提出的预算，是生产得到发展的预算，人民得到幸福的预算，也是和平得到保障的预算。马叙伦委员说：从薄部长的报告和一九五二年度的国家财政收支概算上，完全显示了中国人民的伟大力量。沈钧儒委员说：我们在各方面取得的伟大成绩，正好说明人民民主政权的优越性，希望全国人民团结起来，尤其希望全国文教工作者、知识分子，响应毛主席的号召，进行自我改造，以便更好地为国家的建设而奋斗。马寅初委员说：我们所以能够在军事、政治、经济、文化各方面取得这样巨大的成绩，主要是领导正确，指挥得当，干部得力，人民拥护。章伯钧委员说：薄一波部长的报告，对全国人民，尤其是对各民主党派人士是一大教育，它使我们更为信任毛主席和中国共产党的领导。郭沫若委员说：提前完成毛主席的指示，是一大喜事，是值得庆贺的。只有在人民国家，才能集中各方面的力量用于建设，这就必然保证了战胜敌人，保障了世界和平。司徒美堂委员说：作为一个久居海外的华侨身分来说，感到非常兴奋。祖国在各方面的飞跃进步，必然会受到千百万爱国华侨的拥护，衷心为强大的祖国而庆幸。张治中委员说：这样的报告和预算，在国民党统治时期是从来没有听到过的，也是在中国历史上谁都办不到的，但是我们在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下完全做到了财政经济情况的根本好转，这只能使人兴奋、佩服。徐特立委员说：在今后的企业生产发展中，应注意实际工资的增加和劳动保险的广泛实行，这将使广大工人的生活得到保障，更可以全力为公。符定一委员说：除了衷心感谢毛主席和中国共产党之外，教育工作者必须努力造就人材，为国家的建设服务。
