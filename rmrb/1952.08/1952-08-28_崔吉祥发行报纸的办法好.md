    Cui Jixiang's Method of Distributing Newspapers is Good
    To the Editor: Cui Jixiang, a rural postal worker from the Jincheng County Post Office in Shanxi Province, has a very good method for distributing newspapers. It is introduced as follows:
    Cui Jixiang has three methods for distributing newspapers: First, he often promotes newspaper subscription competitions between villages based on the specific conditions in the countryside. For example, the Shenjiang Village has a larger population and better economic conditions than the Nanya Village, but it subscribes to fewer newspapers than the Nanya Village. He then conducts propaganda among the people of Shenjiang Village, calling on them to read newspapers, and soon the number of newspaper subscriptions in Shenjiang Village increased. Second, he can deeply understand the work situation of the village cadres. Based on the needs of their work, he explains the importance of subscribing to newspapers to cadres who are not active in subscribing, and sometimes gives appropriate criticisms. Third, he can deliver newspapers to subscribers in a timely manner. He said: "Just asking everyone to subscribe to newspapers, but not delivering the newspapers to everyone on time, will not help everyone learn regularly." Therefore, he often goes out on duty on time regardless of wind or rain; when he cannot ride a bicycle, he walks ten or twenty miles to deliver the newspapers on the same day. During the "Three-Anti" movement, the number of newspaper distributions by other postal workers was greatly reduced, but his number of subscribers increased by more than ten households.

    崔吉祥发行报纸的办法好
    编辑同志：山西晋城县邮局乡邮工崔吉祥，发行报纸的办法很好，现介绍如下：
    崔吉祥发行报纸的办法有三：第一，他常根据农村中的具体情况，促使村和村开展订报竞赛。如申匠村比南压村人口多，经济条件也好，但报纸却比南压村订的少，他就向申匠村人民进行宣传，号召他们读报，不久申匠村就增加了订报数目。第二，他能深入的了解村干部工作情况，根据工作的需要对订报不积极的干部说明订报的重要性，有时也适当地进行一些批评。第三，他能及时地给订户送到报纸，他说：“光叫大家订报，不给大家按时送到报纸，就不能经常帮助大家学习。”因之，他经常是风雨无阻地按时出班；不能骑车子时，他走十里二十里地也要当天把报送出。“三反”运动中别的邮工报纸发行数目大减，而他的订户却增加了十余户。松　浩
