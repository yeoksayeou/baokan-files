Northeast Regional Level Cadres Study "On Contradiction"
According to the *Northeast Daily* news: Now, the Northeast level organizations, such as the General Office of the Northeast People's Government, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Personnel, the Northeast People's Government People's Economic Planning Committee, the Northeast Cooperative Business Management Committee, the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration Bureau, the Northeast Women's Federation... and other units, have all successively and universally begun to study Comrade Mao Zedong's great philosophical work "On Contradiction"; especially the responsible cadres above the level of department and bureau directors in various departments, who deeply feel the importance of studying this work, and their enthusiasm for learning is very high.

According to the feedback from various units, the vast majority of comrades participating in the study of "On Contradiction" can carefully read and strive to understand its spirit and essence. Some comrades have read it repeatedly seven or eight times, and have read some reference documents and some other works of Comrade Mao Zedong around this work. Some units, in addition to reading, also conduct multiple informal discussions, first to understand its content, and then to conduct in-depth discussions.

The study and discussion meetings of various units are mostly led by the main responsible comrades themselves and held regularly. For example, the Ministry of Industry, which has always conducted cadre theoretical education well, studies for one hour every day and discusses once a week, and has persisted for a long time without interruption. They began to study "On Contradiction" in mid-May, and by the end of June they had discussed it five times, and everyone spoke very enthusiastically at each discussion meeting. Other departments such as the Ministry of Finance have also held multiple discussions.

When conducting discussions, various units are mostly able to conduct in-depth understanding based on the viewpoints and methods of "On Contradiction," and in connection with the problems in the current revolutionary struggle and practical work. For example, at a discussion meeting on June 11, the Ministry of Industry discussed issues such as "What is the main contradiction in the current work (referring to the Ministry of Industry)?" During the discussion of each issue, there were various different opinions and debates, and finally Minister Wang Heshou made an important speech on the disputed issues, which was very enlightening and helpful to the comrades present. As another example, at a discussion meeting on June 18, the Ministry of Education discussed issues such as "What were the main contradictions in the Northeast education work before this ideological remolding movement?" "Before the ideological remolding movement, which occupied the main position in the minds of teachers, was it bourgeois ideology or the ideology of the working class?" When Vice Ministers Dong Chuncai and Zou Lufeng of the ministry spoke at the discussion meeting, they conducted specific analysis based on concrete materials, so that everyone generally reached a consensus on the issues in dispute. In addition to focusing on the study of what contradictions exist in the current Northeast countryside, which contradiction is the main one, and how to solve it, the Ministry of Agriculture also discussed issues such as "The contradiction between conservatism in work and the development of the situation," "Why are we not good at summarizing experience," and "Why can't we grasp the main contradictions" at two expanded discussion meetings of cadres above the section chief level. Because the comrades attending the meeting had prepared in advance and designated central speakers, the discussion meeting was also relatively substantial. It also had a great enlightening effect on the thinking of the comrades.

For example, when the Ministry of Public Security convened cadres above the section chief level on June 21 to casually talk about their experiences after reading "On Contradiction," some comrades reviewed and said: In the past, they only looked at problems from the phenomenon, and their work was rough, and they could not grasp the essence of things. After studying "On Contradiction," they realized that only by conducting specific analysis can they grasp the essence of things and find solutions to problems. Some comrades said: The reason why the work was not in-depth in the past was because of ideological laziness, and they were unwilling to conduct systematic investigation and research work. Some comrades said: In the past, they often regarded partial experience as universal truth and mechanically applied it everywhere. This is a narrow empiricist way of thinking, so the work achievements are not great. Some comrades said: In the past, because they were not good at using scientific ideological methods, they often could not grasp the key issues, and their sense of fresh things was not sensitive enough, and their understanding often lagged behind the objective reality.... Therefore, everyone generally felt that studying "On Contradiction" was very helpful for their ideological enlightenment and future work improvement.

Various units also felt some difficulties in studying "On Contradiction." For example, some comrades participating in the study in units such as the Northeast Cooperative Business Management Committee and the Northeast Women's Federation felt very strenuous in their studies because of the limitations of their theoretical level. They still cannot well understand the spirit of the document, nor are they good at connecting practical problems to conduct research. The leadership also needs to provide specific help and find ways to solve it.

### 东北区级机关干部学习“矛盾论”

    东北区级机关干部学习“矛盾论”
    据东北日报讯：现在东北一级的机关，如东北人民政府办公厅、工业部、财政部、公安部、教育部、民政部、农业部、林业部、司法部、劳动部、贸易部、人事部、东北人民政府人民经济计划委员会、东北合作事业管理委员会、东北邮电管理总局、东北妇联……等单位，都已先后普遍地开始学习毛泽东同志的伟大的哲学著作“矛盾论”；特别是各部门局、处长以上的负责干部，更深感学习此一著作的重要，学习热情很高。
    根据各单位的反映，所有参加学习“矛盾论”的同志，绝大多数都能认真地阅读，努力领会它的精神与实质。有的同志已经反覆阅读了七八遍，并围绕着此一著作阅读了一些参考文件及毛泽东同志某些其他著作。有的单位，除了阅读之外，还进行多次的漫谈，首先搞通它的内容，然后再进行深入的讨论。
    各单位的学习讨论会，大都由主要负责同志亲自领导，定期举行。如干部理论教育一向进行得较好的工业部，每日学习一小时，每周讨论一次，长期坚持下来，从未间断过。他们自五月中旬开始学习
    “矛盾论”，至六月底已讨论了五次，在每次讨论会上，大家发言都很热烈。其他如财政部等部门的学习也都已进行过多次的讨论。
    各单位在进行讨论时，多能根据“矛盾论”的观点和方法，联系当前革命斗争与实际工作中的问题，进行深刻的领会。如工业部在六月十一日的一次讨论会上，曾讨论了“目前工作上（指工业部）的主要矛盾是什么”等问题，在讨论每一问题时，都有各种不同的意见展开论争，最后并由王鹤寿部长对于所争论的问题，作了重要的发言，对与会同志的启发和帮助很大。再如教育部于六月十八日的
    一次讨论会上，曾讨论了“在此次思想改造运动以前在东北教育工作中所存在的主要矛盾方面是什么”“在思想改造运动以前，在教员思想中占主要地位的是资产阶级思想还是工人阶级思想”等问题，该部董纯才和邹鲁风副部长在讨论会上发言时，都根据具体材料进行了具体的分析，使大家对争论的问题大体上都取得了一致的认识。农业部在两次科长以上干部的扩大讨论会上，除了着重研究目前东北农村有些什么矛盾、哪个矛盾是主要的及如何解决等问题之外，还讨论了“工作保守和形势发展的矛盾”、“为什么不善于总结经验”、“为什么抓不住主要矛盾”等问题，由于事前与会同志都作了准备，并指定了中心发言人，所以讨论会亦较为充实。对同志们思想启发作用也很大。
    如公安部于六月二十一日召集科长以上干部漫谈阅读“矛盾论”后的心得时，有的同志检讨说：过去只从现象上去看问题，工作粗枝大叶，无法把握事物的本质，学习“矛盾论”后，才知道只有进行具体分析，才能把握事物的本质和找到解决问题的方法。有的同志说：以往工作所以不深入，原因是思想上懒惰，不愿意进行系统的调查研究工作。有的同志说：过去常常把片面的经验当作普遍的真理，到处机械地搬用，这是狭隘的经验主义的思想方法，所以工作成绩不大。有的同志说：过去因为不善于运用科学的思想方法，所以往往把握不住关键性的问题，对新鲜事物的感觉亦不够敏锐，认识常常落后于客观实际……。因之，大家普遍地感觉到，学习“矛盾论”后，对于自己的思想启发和今后工作的改进都有很大帮助。
    各单位在学习“矛盾论”中亦感到一些困难，如东北合作事业管理委员会、东北妇联等单位的某些参加学习的同志，因为理论水平限制，感到学习很吃力，还不能很好领会文件的精神，也不大善于联系实际问题进行研究。还需要领导上具体帮助，设法解决。
