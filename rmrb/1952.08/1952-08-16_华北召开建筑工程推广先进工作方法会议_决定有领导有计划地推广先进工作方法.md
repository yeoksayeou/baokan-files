    North China Convenes Meeting on Promoting Advanced Working Methods in Construction Engineering
    Decides to Promote Advanced Working Methods with Leadership and Planning
    The Industry Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council and the North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened the North China Construction Engineering Promotion of Advanced Working Methods Conference from July 21st to 26th. The conference studied the problems in promoting advanced working methods in the construction industry in the North China region and the related issue of fixed workers.

    According to the representatives from various parts of North China who attended the meeting, there are currently 493 bricklaying and carpentry teams in major cities in North China, with approximately 9,500 people studying advanced working methods, and 110 tools have been created and improved. After implementing advanced working methods, these teams have significantly increased production efficiency and saved a large amount of wealth for the country. However, in the process of promoting advanced working methods, there are still serious conservative ideas and resistance to the promotion of advanced experience. Some cadres, seeing that workers were not proficient enough in mastering new working methods and had some problems in their work, strongly criticized them. Some administrative cadres used bureaucratic attitudes to dampen the enthusiasm of workers. The accumulation of rationalization proposals from workers is even more common. Some leading cadres support the promotion of advanced working methods in words, but in practice, they don't care; some provinces and cities attach importance to this work, but remain in the pilot stage for a long time without launching a mass movement. Some workers, especially veteran skilled workers, also have conservative ideas. They do not welcome and are not accustomed to new working methods. Some veteran skilled workers in Beijing said, "Without your method, we still built the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the past." This greatly hinders the learning of advanced working methods by ordinary workers.

    On the first day of the meeting, Liu Xiufeng, Deputy Director of the North China Administrative Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said: The construction industry is an important part of China's industrial construction, national defense construction, and other constructions. When the country's large-scale construction is about to begin, basic construction must be raised to a very important position. He pointed out that the direction of increasing production and practicing economy in the construction industry is to improve project quality, increase output, and reduce costs, which is to achieve "fast, good, and economical." In order to achieve this goal, we must learn from and promote advanced experience. In the past, as a result of reactionary rule, China lacked experience in large construction factories, large projects, and important national defense projects; therefore, we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in surveying, design, drawing, and construction. The process of promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the advanced experience we have created is a process of struggle between advanced and conservative ideas, a process of advanced workers helping intermediate and backward workers learn, and a process of technicians helping workers to jointly create and improve each other. The promotion of advanced working methods must be based on the workers' consciousness and willingness, and must not be forced. Therefore, he emphasized that the key to promoting advanced working methods lies in leadership, that is, leading cadres must carry out in-depth and specific organizational work, do more ideological education work among technicians and workers, and give play to the creativity of technicians and skilled workers. At the same time, he also pointed out that it is necessary to promote the main advanced experiences that play a decisive role, and to synthesize and unify many tricks and creations into several main experiences and promote them throughout the region.

    Based on the above situation and the instructions of Deputy Director Liu Xiufeng, the meeting determined that in the future, advanced working methods should be publicized with great fanfare, and advanced working methods should be promoted with leadership and planning. Finance and Economic Committees of each province and city, as well as state-owned construction companies and even construction sites, should establish committees for promoting advanced working methods to strengthen the leadership of the promotion work. At the same time, strengthen the communist and patriotic education of employees, encourage employees to learn new working methods with a new labor attitude, and overcome the conservative, championship-seeking, and formalistic ideas of some employees.

    At the meeting, representatives from various provinces and cities drafted promotion plans, guaranteeing that before the end of this year, more than 50% of the workers in various regions would learn and adopt advanced working methods; strive to cultivate one or two model teams with excellent political and technical skills in each construction site.

    The meeting also focused on the issue of fixed workers. Since construction workers have always been mobile and scattered, it is not easy to conduct organized education. Therefore, from the perspective of promoting advanced working methods to improve the labor productivity of the construction industry, fixing workers is very necessary. However, in most areas of North China, the construction industry only has eight months of construction period in a year, and the Suiyuan province is even shorter, only five months. If all construction workers are fixed for a long time now, it will not be conducive to the development of the construction industry. Based on this situation, the meeting determined two types of fixed methods: one is long-term workers, who are fixed in the company year-round; the other is seasonal workers, who are fixed as company workers only for five to eight months in the form of a contract. Representatives from various regions, based on the specific conditions of their regions, planned to fix long-term workers to account for 10% to 30% of all workers before the end of the year, striving to reach 30%. Seasonal workers generally plan to strive to fix 50% to 60% before the end of the year.

    During the meeting, the representatives exchanged experiences in learning advanced working methods through performances and visits. The worker representatives stated that after returning to the construction sites, they must play a leading role and work hard to promote advanced working methods.

    The meeting also studied issues such as quotas, rewards, labor protection, worker welfare, and site management caused by the promotion of advanced working methods.

    华北召开建筑工程推广先进工作方法会议
    决定有领导有计划地推广先进工作方法
    政务院华北行政委员会工业局和中华全国总工会华北工作委员会，在七月二十一日到二十六日，联合召开华北建筑工程推广先进工作方法会议。研究了华北全区建筑工业推广先进工作方法中的问题，和与此相联系的固定工人的问题。
    据参加会议的华北各地代表反映：目前华北各大城市已有四百九十三个瓦工和木工小组，约九千五百多人学习了先进工作方法，已创造和改进工具一百一十件。这些小组实行了先进工作方法以后，都显著地提高了生产效率，为国家节省了大量财富。但是，在推广先进工作方法中，还遇到严重的保守思想，抵抗先进经验的推广。有的干部看见工人由于掌握新工作方法不够熟练而在工作中有点毛病时，就大加指责。有些行政干部用官僚主义态度，打击工人的积极性。至于积压工人合理化建议的情形，更为普遍。也有些领导干部口头上支持推广先进工作方法，实际上却不管；有些省市重视了这一工作，但却长久地停留在典型试验阶段，没有发动群众性的运动。某些工人，特别是老技术工人中也有保守思想。他们不欢迎和不习惯新的工作方法。北京有些老技术工人说：“不用你这法子，当年也把太和殿盖起来了。”这对于一般工人学习先进工作方法的阻碍很大。
    会议第一天，华北行政委员会副主任刘秀峰到会讲话。他说：建筑工业是目前我国工业建设、国防建设和其他建设的重要组成部分，当国家大规模建设即将开始时，基本建设必须被提到十分重要的地位。他指出建筑工业的增产节约方向是：提高工程质量、增加产量、降低成本，就是要做到“快、好、省”。为了达到这个目的，就必须学习和推广先进经验。过去由于反动统治的结果，中国建筑大工厂、大工程和重要国防工程的经验，是十分缺乏的；因此从勘查设计、制图施工等方面都要认真学习苏联的先进经验。推广苏联先进经验和我们创造的先进经验的过程，是先进思想和保守思想斗争的过程，也是先进工作者帮助中间的和落后的职工学习的过程，也是技术人员帮助工人共同创造、互相提高的过程。先进工作方法的推广，必须建筑在工人的自觉、自愿的基础上，不能强迫命令。因此，他着重指出，推广先进工作方法的关键在于领导，就是领导干部必须进行深入和具体的组织工作，在技术人员和工人中多做思想教育工作，发挥技术人员和技术工人的创造性。同时，他又指出要推广那些起决定作用的主要先进经验，要把许多窍门和创造综合，统一为几种主要的经验，在全区推广。
    会议根据以上情况和刘秀峰副主任的指示，确定今后应大张旗鼓地宣传先进工作方法，有领导、有计划地推广先进工作方法。各省、市财政经济委员会和公营建筑公司以至工地都应成立推广先进工作方法委员会，以加强推广工作的领导。同时加强对职工的共产主义和爱国主义的教育，鼓舞职工以新的劳动态度学习新工作方法，克服部分职工存在的保守主义、锦标主义和形式主义思想。
    会上，各省市代表都拟出了推广计划，保证各地在今年年底以前，发动百分之五十以上的工人学会并采用先进工作方法；争取每个工地培养一个到两个政治和技术都相当优秀的模范小组。
    会议也集中研究了固定工人的问题。由于建筑工人历来就是流动的、分散的，不容易有组织的进行教育，因此，从推广先进工作方法以提高建筑业的劳动生产率方面来说，固定工人是十分必要的。但华北大部分地区建筑工业在一年内，只有八个月的施工期，绥远省更短，只有五个月。假如目前就把全部建筑工人长年固定下来，也不利于建筑工业的发展。会议根据这种情况，确定了两种固定办法；一种是长期工，即长年固定在公司里；另一种是季节工，即以合同形式，只在五个月到八个月期间内，固定为公司的工人。各地区代表们根据本地区具体情况，分别计划到年底以前，固定长期工应占全部工人的百分之十到百分之三十，争取到百分之三十。季节工一般都计划在年底以前争取固定百分之五十到六十。
    在会议期间，代表们通过表演、参观，互相交流了学习先进工作方法的经验。工人代表们表示回到工地后，一定要起带头作用，努力推广先进工作方法。
    会议对因推广先进工作法所引起的定额、奖励、劳动保护、工人福利和工地管理等问题也作了研究。
