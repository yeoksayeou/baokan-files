    Experiences in Promoting Advanced Experiences
    Comrade Editor: The Wuxi Private Lixin Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory began promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in November of last year, and soon all 200+ roving frame operators in the entire fine spinning workshop had learned it. I am a production committee member of the factory's trade union and am also responsible for promotion work. In my work, I deeply realized that to promote advanced work methods well, it is necessary to specifically explain the value and significance of advanced work methods to the workers. For example, when I explained to the workers, "If every fine spinning worker in textile factories in southern Jiangsu masters the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, they can increase production by more than 2,000 pieces of yarn each year, which can weave more than 60,000 more bolts of cloth," it greatly motivated the workers' production enthusiasm. At the same time, I believe that when starting to promote, the workers in the promotion team must establish close contact with the surrounding employees and constantly spread their learning gains and experiences. Our factory first promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in my group. At that time, the employees in my group did not forget to talk to workers in other groups about the benefits of learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and their own experiences while eating in the dining hall. Now, our factory is vigorously promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and other work methods. The workers in the winding shop have recently learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and the results are very good, with the amount of oily yarn produced dropping from eight to ten pounds per day to 1.2 pounds.

    推广先进经验过程中的体验
    编辑同志：无锡市私营丽新纺织印染厂自去年十一月开始推广郝建秀工作法，不久全细纱间二百多个挡车工便都学会了。我是厂工会生产委员，也负责推广工作。在工作中，我深深体会到，要把先进工作法推广好，必须要具体地向工人说明先进工作法的价值和意义。如当我向工人说明“苏南每个纺织厂的细纱工人，如果都掌握了郝建秀工作法，每年可增产二千多件纱，可多织六万多匹布”后，大大地激励了工人们的生产情绪。同时，我认为开始推广时，推广组的工人一定要和周围职工取得密切联系，随时传播自己学习的收获和经验。我厂先在我那个组推广郝建秀工作法，当时，我组里的职工，在饭堂里吃饭时也不忘和别组工人谈学习郝建秀工作法的好处和自己的体验。现在，我厂正在大力推广郝建秀工作法和其他各种工作法。洋线间工人最近也学习了郝建秀工作法，成绩很好，由每天出油纱八磅至十磅降至一点二磅。私营丽新纱厂工业劳动模范　李霞影
