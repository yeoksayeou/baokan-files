    On a New Front
    – Record of the PLA Soldiers Participating in the Jingjiang Diversion Project
    Xing Shicao

    In late June, we visited the Jingjiang Diversion Project with excitement and admiration. We were all moved. This was not only because we personally saw the nation's first modern sluice gate and the long and sturdy levee, but mainly because such a vast project could be completed perfectly to specifications in just two and a half months. Before this, friends from capitalist countries who visited the construction site believed that such a project would take three or four years to complete; however, we quickly built it successfully even with technical conditions that were not yet perfect. What was the reason for this? There are certainly many reasons, but one very important reason is the result of the round-the-clock hard work of the 300,000-strong labor army. And among these 300,000 people, the 100,000 PLA soldiers played a major role.

    On the 25th, we visited the Jingjiang Diversion Headquarters in Shashi. They were in a meeting. Participants included generals and the vice-governor of the province. There were maps on the table, and maps on all the walls, but these were not military operation maps, but blueprints of water conservancy projects. They were studying future water conservancy work. This meeting reminded me of the joint meetings often held by military and political leaders during the People's Liberation War to save the people from the enslavement of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous regime. Now, for the growth of rice ears on the plains on both sides of the Jingjiang River, for the blooming of lotus flowers in the ponds, for the happy lives of millions of people, they are holding meetings here again, working hard to eliminate natural disasters. They have moved from one front to another, but there is something that remains unchanged, and that is a strong spirit of serving the people.

    One day, we went to see General Tang Tianji, the chief commander. On his desk, I saw thick books such as "Water Conservancy Engineering" and "Jingjiang Water Conservancy Data." He said calmly to us: "The Jingjiang Diversion is something we are not familiar with, but we follow Chairman Mao's instructions, learning while doing, planning while revising. Under the guidance of the thought of 'promoting people's interests and eliminating evils,' everyone works together, and thus the unfamiliar and vast project was finally completed ahead of schedule."

    This earnest learning attitude and the spirit of being responsible to the people and the motherland are the fundamental reasons why our generals and soldiers can also achieve victory on the water conservancy engineering front. Take the troops' participation in the gate construction project as an example. After a short period of study, many soldiers can skillfully use cement mixers. Some learned the entire set of steel bar technology in five days, and some learned concrete pouring, tamping, curing, and other technologies. The specifications of the work meet the requirements, and the efficiency is comparable to that of ordinary workers. When a certain unit poured the 44-hole gate foundation of the diversion gate, it completed the task in just over seven hours and created a new record. The cement mixer of a group of engineers from a certain unit exceeded the work efficiency of technical workers and won the title of "Glorious Locomotive." In this way, in a short period of time, they learned new scientific knowledge and engineering technology, and won the praise of technicians and workers on the construction site.

    At the celebration meeting, we heard such a story: A soldier named Li Shijun heard many unheard-of names of machine parts when he started learning the cement mixer. Such as exhaust valves, percolation filters, etc., which he found really difficult. But after patient study, he mastered it freely in just over ten days. Later, someone asked him: "How could you learn to master such a complex machine in such a short period of time?" He replied: "The principle is very simple. When I think that I am learning for the people, I have the courage, I am not afraid of difficulties, and the enthusiasm for studying is greater. I constantly ask the workers for advice. During meals and breaks, I recite those names and memorize those principles, and slowly I learned it."

    The soldiers not only demonstrated their wisdom and tireless learning attitude, but also demonstrated the glorious tradition of the People's Army of being firm, resolute, and capable of enduring hardship.

    In the Jingjiang Diversion Project, the construction of the Huangtian Lake New Embankment was the most difficult. Huangtian Lake is actually a silt pool. To build a dike, the silt must first be drained to see the hard bottom before filling in the soil. This entire project relied on the soldiers' two hands and some simple tools to remove the silt one handful at a time, and then fill the new soil in one basket at a time. Eighteen days later, Huangtian Lake was finally cut in two, and a levee more than 4,000 meters long was built to block the flood from rushing into Hunan.

    In this silt drainage project, an outstanding combat hero became a labor model. His name is Yan Shanlin, a platoon leader. In the past days of war, he had been stabbed by the enemy and had his leg bone broken. But at the beginning of the diversion project, he said: "I will never let this disability affect my work."

    He jumped into the silt and worked under the scorching sun and the attack of heavy rain. His hands and feet were scratched by shells and water chestnuts, and the stench of rotten plants made it difficult for him to breathe. But all this did not delay him in the slightest. When carrying soil to build the embankment, he carried a load of more than one hundred kilograms and ran back and forth.

    The thousands of heroes there not only possess this spirit of perseverance and hard work, but also brought into play the collective wisdom, reformed many tools, and created many new operating methods, which greatly improved work efficiency. Comrade Li Guoren, a 22-year-old squad leader, improved the operating methods by leading the masses, ensured that everyone's bodies became stronger day by day, and continuously improved work efficiency. His entire squad of ten people extracted 35.5 cubic meters of soil from a distance of 320 meters within nine hours. He himself participated in a total of 56 working days, extracting 145.7 cubic meters of soil, about 700,000 kilograms. The road he traveled back and forth calculated to be 7,300 li, which means he had to walk 130 li and transport more than 10,000 kilograms of soil every day.

    According to the statistics of the Diversion Headquarters, the labor efficiency of each soldier exceeded that of an ordinary migrant worker by more than two times on average. But they are not proud or complacent. They are always looking forward. Wei Yutao, the artillery company commander of a certain unit, said well when he attended the celebration meeting: "The motherland's construction cause is constantly advancing. This is a cause of seeking happiness for the people. I will always be loyal to these causes. In order to continuously improve the lives of the people and to build our country, I will contribute everything I have."

    在新的战线上
    ——记参加荆江分洪工程的解放军健儿们
    邢石操
    六月下旬，我们怀着兴奋和敬佩的心情，参观了荆江分洪工程。我们都受到了感动。这不仅因为我们亲身看到了全国第一的现代化的水闸和长而坚固的大堤，主要的还是因为这样浩大的工程，竟能在短短的两个半月当中，完全合乎规格地圆满竣工。在这之前，那些来自资本主义国家的朋友们到工地看了以后，都认为这样的工程需要三、四年才能完成；可是我们竟在技术条件还不十分完备的情况下，很快的建造成功了。这是什么原因？原因固然很多，但很重要原因之一，是由于三十万劳动大军日夜辛勤劳动的结果。而在这三十万人里面，十万解放军健儿又起了主力作用。
    二十五日，我们在沙市访问了荆江分洪总指挥部。他们正在开会。参加会议的有将军，也有省副主席，桌子上是地图，四壁也是地图，不过这不是军用作战地图，而是一些水利工程的蓝图。他们正在研究未来的水利工作。这个会议使我联想起在人民解放战争期间，为了把人民从蒋介石卖国政权奴役下拯救出来，军政首长们常常举行这样的联席会议。现在，为了荆江两岸平原上稻穗的成长、池塘里荷花的盛开，为了数百万人民幸福的生活，他们又在这里举行会议，为消灭天灾而努力。他们从一个战线转到另一个战线，但是这里面有一种东西是不变的，那就是强烈的为人民服务的精神。
    有一天，我们到总指挥唐天际将军那里去。在他的办公桌上，我看到了“水利工程学”、“荆江水利资料”等厚厚的书籍。他安详地对我们说：“荆江分洪是我们不熟悉的东西，可是我们遵照着毛主席的指示，一面做一面学，一面计划一面修正。在‘为人民兴利除弊’的思想指导下，大家一齐努力，于是生疏而又浩大的工程，终于提前完成。”
    这样恳切的学习态度和对人民对祖国负责的精神，是我们的将军和战士在水利工程战线上同样能获得胜利的基本原因。就拿部队参加建闸工程来说吧，有不少的战士，经过短时间的学习，就能随手应心地使用水泥拌合机。有的在五天之内学会全套钢筋技术，有的学会浇灌混凝土、捣固、养护等技术。工作的规格既合乎要求，效率也和普通工作不相上下。某部在浇灌进洪闸四十四孔闸基的时候，仅用七个多钟头，就完成了任务并创造了新纪录。某部工兵连一个小组的水泥拌合机，超过了技术工人的工作效率，荣获“光荣机车”称号。就是这样，在短短的时间内，他们学会了新的科学知识和工程技术，博得了工地上技师和工人们的称赞。
    我们在庆功会上听到这样一个故事：有一个名叫李士俊的战士，开始学习水泥拌合机的时候，听到许多从未听过的机件名称。如排气凡尔、滤渗器等等，他实在感到困难。但是经过耐心的学习，十多天就驾驭自如了。后来有人问他：“这样短的时间，你怎么就能学会掌握这样复杂的机器呀？”他回答道：“道理很简单，当我一想到我是在为人民而学习的时候，我就有了勇气，就不怕困难，钻研的劲头就大了。我不断地向工人请教。吃饭的时候，休息的时候，我就背诵那些名称，熟记那些原理，慢慢的就学会了。”
    战士们不仅表现了他们的智慧和不倦的学习态度，他们还表现出人民军队刚毅果敢、吃苦耐劳的光荣传统。
    在荆江分洪工程当中，要算修筑黄天湖新堤最艰苦。黄天湖实际上是一个淤泥潭，要筑堤就要先排淤，见到硬底再填土。这全部工程都靠战士们两只手和一些简单的工具，把淤泥一把把的排出去，再把新土一筐筐的填起来。十八天之后，终于把黄天湖一刀两断，筑起一条长达四千多公尺的大堤，拦住洪水，不得冲向湖南。
    在这次排淤工程当中，有一个出色的战斗英雄，变成了劳动模范，他的名字叫颜山林，是一个排长。他在过去战争的日子里，曾被敌人刺伤过，打坏过腿骨。但他在分洪工程开始时表示：“我决不因为这点残废而影响工作。”
    他跳在淤泥里面冒着烈日的曝晒和急雨的袭击劳动着，手脚被贝壳、菱角划破了，腐烂的植物的恶臭，使他难以呼吸。但是这一切都没有使他耽误过一点工。在担土筑堤的时候，他挑着一百多斤的担子，来回奔跑。
    那里的千万英雄们，不仅具有这种坚忍不拔、刻苦耐劳的斗争精神，他们还发挥了集体的智慧，改造了许多工具，创造了许多新的操作方法，使工效大大提高。二十二岁的班长李国仁同志，由于领导群众，改善了操作方法，保证了大家身体日益强壮，工效不断提高，全班十个人，九小时之内，在三百二十公尺的远距上，取了三十五方半土。他自己共参加了五十六个劳动日，取土一四五·七公方，约有七十万斤。来回走的路，计算起来有七千三百里，这就是说每天要走一百三十里路，运一万多斤土。
    根据分洪总指挥部的统计，平均每个战士的劳动效率超过一个普通的民工两倍多。可是他们并不骄傲居功，他们永远在向前看。某部炮兵连长魏玉桃出席庆功大会的时候说得好：“祖国的建设事业，正在不断地前进，这是为人民谋幸福的事业，我将永远忠于这些事业。为了人民生活的不断改善，为了建设我们的国家，我要贡献出我的一切。”
