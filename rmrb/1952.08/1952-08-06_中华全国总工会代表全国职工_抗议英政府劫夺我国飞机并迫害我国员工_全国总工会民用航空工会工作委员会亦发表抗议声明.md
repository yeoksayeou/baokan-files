Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has lodged a strong protest against the British government's seizure of the "Two Airlines" aircraft and persecution of Chinese employees protecting the assets. The protest stated: "The 'Two Airlines' aircraft left in Hong Kong, belonging to the Chinese people, are the property of the Chinese people. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly pointed out that only our Central People's Government and personnel entrusted by the Central People's Government have the right to dispose of this property, and no one is allowed to infringe, move, or damage it by any means. However, under the instigation of American imperialism and in collusion with the Kuomintang remnant clique, the British government has carried out a series of conspiratorial actions against this property, causing the Chinese people's property to be unreasonably detained in Hong Kong for more than two years. Recently, the British government even used the legal trick of 'property rights litigation' to award it to the American imperialist element Chennault, and has resorted to violence against our asset-protecting employees, subjecting them to beatings, arrests, and detention. All of this can only show that the British government is acting in accordance with the will of American imperialism and is hostile to the Chinese people.

All the workers of the People's Republic of China are filled with boundless anger at the British government's actions against the Chinese people. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, representing all the workers of New China, fully supports and resolutely backs the protest statement of Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of our Central People's Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and points out to the British government: The property of the Chinese people is inviolable, and the workers of New China must not be unreasonably beaten and detained. We solemnly warn the British government that it must immediately cease its illegal seizure, return all the property of the 'Two Airlines' left in Hong Kong, and guarantee the freedom and safety of our asset-protecting employees."

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Civil Aviation Trade Union Working Committee issued a statement on the 4th, lodging a strong protest with the British government against the illegal actions of the Hong Kong British government in seizing our aircraft left in Hong Kong and persecuting our employees left in Hong Kong. It also expressed full support for Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu's protest statement and resolved to fight to the end to defend the legitimate rights and interests of the motherland.

The statement pointed out: This incident once again proves that the British government is blindly following the will of American imperialism and deliberately hostile to our people. All the aircraft and equipment of the "Two Airlines" left in Hong Kong are the sacred and inviolable property of the Chinese people, and the British government is absolutely not allowed to seize them under any pretext or by playing any tricks.

The statement continued: All the aircraft and equipment of the "Two Airlines" in Hong Kong have always been an inseparable part of the Chinese people's property. Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of our Central People's Government made a solemn statement on this fact as early as December 3, 1949. For more than two years, our civil aviation employees protecting assets in Hong Kong have been actively striving for the early return of this part of the Chinese people's property to the motherland, and have waged a heroic and unyielding struggle against the British government, American imperialism, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. However, the British government has always complied with the demands of American imperialism and carried out all kinds of obstruction and sabotage against us. First, they prevented our aircraft from taking off and returning to the country, then they condoned the Kuomintang bandits and special agents to explode and sabotage, and then they played legal tricks and planned a so-called "property rights litigation," so that recently they openly seized all the property left in Hong Kong by our "Two Airlines" companies, including 70 aircraft. This series of illegal actions by the British government, in addition to arousing the unparalleled anger of all our civil aviation employees, has made us more clearly aware of the British government's policy of following American imperialism and being extremely unfriendly to the Chinese people.

The statement concluded: All the aircraft and equipment of the "Two Airlines" left in Hong Kong are the sacred property of the People's Republic of China, and we will never sit idly by while the British government wantonly seizes them. Therefore, we must once again lodge a serious protest with the British government and solemnly warn the British government: You must immediately cease your illegal seizure, return all the property of the "Two Airlines" left in Hong Kong, and guarantee the freedom and safety of our asset-protecting employees. Otherwise, you will bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this incident.

    中华全国总工会代表全国职工
    抗议英政府劫夺我国飞机并迫害我国员工
    全国总工会民用航空工会工作委员会亦发表抗议声明
    【新华社五日讯】中华全国总工会对英国政府劫夺我国两航飞机并迫害我护产员工提出坚决的抗议。抗议书称：“中国人民的两航留港飞机，是中国人民的财产，中华人民共和国中央人民政府一再指出，该项财产只有我中央人民政府和中央人民政府委托的人员才有权处置，决不容许任何人以任何手段侵犯、移动或损坏。但是英国政府在美帝国主义指使下，并勾结国民党残余集团对该项财产施行了一系列的阴谋手段，致使中国人民的该项财产无理地被扣留在香港达两年多之久，而最近英国政府竟以‘产权诉讼’的法律骗局判给美国帝国主义分子陈纳德，并对我护产员工横施暴力，进行殴击、逮捕和拘禁，这一切都只能说明英国政府是在顺从着美帝国主义的意旨与中国人民为敌。
    中华人民共和国的全体工人，对英国政府这种与中国人民为敌的行为，具有无限的愤怒，中华全国总工会，代表新中国全体职工完全拥护和坚决支持我中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长的抗议声明，并向英国政府指出：中国人民的财产是不能侵犯的，新中国的工人更不能被无理地殴击和拘禁。我们严正地警告英国政府，必须立即停止你们的非法劫夺行为，交还两航留在香港的全部财产，并保证我护产员工的自由与安全。”
    【新华社四日讯】中华全国总工会中国民用航空工会工作委员会在四日发表声明，对香港英国政府劫夺我留港飞机，迫害我留港员工的非法行为，向英国政府提出坚决抗议。并表示完全拥护章汉夫副部长的抗议声明，决心为保卫祖国的合法权益而斗争到底。
    声明指出：这一事件再一次证明了英国政府是一味顺从美帝国主义的意旨，蓄意与我国人民为敌的。两航留在香港的全部飞机和器材是中国人民神圣不可侵犯的财产，绝对不允许英国政府以任何藉口和玩弄任何花样来进行劫夺。
    声明继称：两航在香港的全部飞机和器材，一向是中国人民财产不可分割的一部分，我中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理也早在一九四九年十二月三日，就这一事实做了郑重的声明。两年多来我民航在香港的护产职工一直为这一部分属于中国人民的财产早日回到祖国而积极地奋斗着，并曾与英国政府、美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮进行了英勇不屈的斗争。然而英国政府始终顺从美帝国主义的要求，对我们进行了百般阻挠和阴谋破坏。始则不让我们的飞机起飞回国，继则纵容国民党匪特爆炸破坏，再则玩弄法律骗局，策划了一套所谓“产权诉讼”，以致最近竟公然对我两航公司留在香港的包括七十架飞机在内的全部财产进而劫夺。英国政府这一系列的非法行为除激起了我全体民航职工无比的愤怒外，更加使我们清楚认识了英国政府追随美帝国主义和对中国人民极不友好的政策。
    声明最后指出：两航留在香港的全部飞机和器材是中华人民共和国的神圣财产，我们绝不能坐视英国政府肆意劫夺而置之不理，因此，我们要再一次地向英国政府提出严重抗议，并严正地警告英国政府：必须立即停止你们的非法劫夺行为，交还两航留在香港的全部财产，并保证我护产员工自由与安全，否则，你们要负由这一事件所引起的全部责任和一切后果。
