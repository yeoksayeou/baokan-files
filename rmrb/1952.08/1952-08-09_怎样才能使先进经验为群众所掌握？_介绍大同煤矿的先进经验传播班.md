How Can Advanced Experiences Be Mastered by the Masses?
    ——Introducing the Advanced Experience Dissemination Class of Datong Coal Mine

From July of last year to June of this year, Datong Coal Mine summarized and promoted a total of more than twenty advanced experiences, increasing the mine's mechanical efficiency from about 42 percent to 82 percent. The average monthly progress of mechanical tunneling teams has more than doubled. The efficiency of pneumatic drill operators has increased by half to two times. Each coal cutting machine has increased from one cycle of work per day and night to one and a half to two cycles, exceeding the quota of 40 cycles per month stipulated by the Central Coal Mine Administration for Datong Coal Mine. The main reason why Datong Coal Mine has enabled the vast majority of workers to master advanced experiences and achieve such great results is the holding of "Advanced Experience Dissemination Classes."

The "Advanced Experience Dissemination Class" not only implemented the principle of combining theory with practice, but also carried out the summary and promotion of advanced experiences in a guided and step-by-step manner from beginning to end. The effect of holding the "Advanced Experience Dissemination Class" can be seen particularly clearly in the process of summarizing and promoting the "Ma Liuhai Multi-Channel Cyclic Tunneling Method." Although each mechanical tunneling team in Datong Coal Mine implemented two-and-a-half channel cyclic operations in the first half of last year, the efficiency was still not high, and it varied greatly. For example, in June of last year, the average monthly progress of each team in the mine was only 134 meters, while the Ma Liuhai team reached as high as 318.71 meters. In July, the mine held an "Advanced Experience Dissemination Class" to promote the experience of the Ma Liuhai team, but the Ma Liuhai team's drilling was slow, so the rapid drilling method of the Wang Zhande team was also promoted. Beforehand, the "Advanced Experience Dissemination Class," with the help of the wellhead technicians, summarized their experiences, with Ma and Wang acting as instructors and the technicians acting as teaching assistants, explaining them one by one with the aid of charts and figures. For example, the main reason why the Wang Zhande team drilled quickly was that they adopted different angles, positions, and distances of blast holes according to the hardness of the coal quality. The technicians used diagrams and figures to explain from a mechanical point of view why the angle, size, and position arrangement of blast holes should be different in different coal quality situations. In this way, the actual experience of the workers was combined with theory, and the workers said that it was easy to understand and easy to learn after listening. However, "seeing is believing," and some workers still had resistance to advanced experiences after listening to the lectures. Therefore, after the lectures, the Ma Liuhai and Wang Zhande teams held on-site demonstrations one after another, finally convincing some people with conservative ideas. After visiting the Ma Liuhai team's performance, the old worker Zhao You said: "In the past, I stuck to my old technology and didn't believe in other people's experience. After seeing this, my eyes are clear." After understanding the advanced experience technically and accepting it ideologically, each team immediately formulated specific promotion plans and signed collective contracts with the administrative side to ensure the implementation of the promotion plans. In this way, in August of last year, four of the 19 mechanical tunneling teams in the mine exceeded 400 meters, three teams exceeded 300 meters, and six teams exceeded 200 meters. The average tunneling efficiency increased by 30 to 150 percent compared with June. Later, the workers proposed that although the promotion of the experiences of the Ma Liuhai and Wang Zhande teams had improved efficiency, the problem of the connection between transporters and tunnelers had not been solved; the blast holes were not deep enough, and the holes were difficult to drill in the interbedded coal seams. The mine leadership further adopted the Kovalev work method, absorbing the experiences of the Zhao You team in learning from the Soviet Union's "rhythmic production according to instruction charts," the Sheng Diancai team's deep-hole operations, and the Wang Shouming team's drilling in interbedded coal seams, and continued to hold several "Advanced Experience Dissemination Classes" to promote them. Due to this continuous summarization and promotion, promotion and summarization, the Ma Liuhai team's rapid tunneling experience became more abundant and complete, and finally the "Ma Liuhai Multi-Channel Cyclic Tunneling Method" was summarized. At the same time, the vast majority of workers mastered advanced experiences better, and the promotion achievements were greater. For example, the Liu Shouren team only started using mechanical tunneling in the second half of December last year, but the monthly progress in April of this year reached 551.42 meters, which even exceeded the Ma Liuhai team's progress in the same month.

The "Advanced Experience Dissemination Class," this organizational form and working method for summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, was found in Datong Coal Mine after a period of exploration. After Datong Coal Mine began implementing mechanized production in August 1950, in order to make the workers' operating techniques and working methods adapt to the requirements of mechanization, training classes for coal cutting machines and electric drills were opened. However, the training classes could only help workers understand some basic theoretical issues about machinery, while what the workers urgently needed were the specific experiences of each link in the work process. Therefore, in the first half of last year, many advanced producer conferences, labor model symposiums, and work-type symposiums were held to exchange production experience. These meetings, because they did not absorb the participation of technical personnel, could not comprehensively improve the workers' experience. The workers felt scattered after listening, and they knew what it was, but not why it was; at the same time, they were limited to oral conversations and did not have on-site visits, which could not break the conservative thinking among the workers. Therefore, some advanced experiences still remained in some advanced teams. In July of last year, the leadership accepted this experience and lesson, and proposed to use the "Advanced Experience Dissemination Class" to summarize and promote advanced experiences in order to quickly improve the workers' operating techniques and working methods and give full play to mechanical efficiency. However, it encountered many ideological obstacles: some cadres believed that the workers would exchange experience themselves and did not need technical personnel; some technical personnel believed that to improve the workers' operating techniques, they could only transfer workers away from production and open technical training classes. After several "Advanced Experience Dissemination Classes," some people who originally held skeptical and opposing attitudes reversed their views. At a meeting to summarize the "Advanced Experience Dissemination Class," Chief Engineer Zhang Jiying said: "It's not that the workers' experience is useless, but that we didn't help them summarize it in the past." Some people who originally neglected the role of technical personnel also realized that without the help of technical personnel, the experiences of Ma Liuhai and others could not be summarized so well. From then on, the "Advanced Experience Dissemination Class" held once a month gradually became popular throughout the mine.

    怎样才能使先进经验为群众所掌握？
    ——介绍大同煤矿的先进经验传播班
    新华社记者  任家骥
    大同煤矿从去年七月到今年六月一共总结和推广了二十多种先进经验，使全矿的机械效能约由百分之四十二提高到百分之八十二。机械掘进小组月进度平均提高了一倍以上。风钻手打眼效率提高了半倍到两倍。每台割煤机由一昼夜工作一个循环增为一个半到两个循环，超过了中央煤矿管理总局给大同煤矿规定的每月工作四十个循环的定额。大同煤矿使广大工人都能掌握先进经验并取得这样大的成绩，主要是由于举办了“先进经验传播班”。
    “先进经验传播班”，不仅贯彻了理论和实际相结合的原则，而且自始至终是有领导、有步骤地进行先进经验的总结和推广工作。举办“先进经验传播班”的效果，在总结和推广“马六孩多孔道循环掘进工作法”的过程中，可以特别明显地看得出来。大同煤矿各个机械掘进小组，虽在去年上半年都实行了两个半孔道循环作业，但效率仍不高，并且高低不一。如去年六月份，全矿各组平均月进度只一百三十四公尺，而马六孩小组却高达三百一十八点七一公尺。七月间，矿上举办“先进经验传播班”，推广马六孩小组的经验，但马六孩小组打眼较慢，所以同时又推广王占德小组的快速打眼方法。事前，“先进经验传播班”在井口技术员帮助下，把他们的经验总结好，由马、王二人当教员讲授，技术员当助教，用图表和数字一一辅助讲解。如王占德小组打眼快的主要原因，是根据煤质的硬度，采取不同的炮眼的角度和位置距离，技术员就用图和数字，从力学上来说明为什么在不同煤质的情况下，炮眼的角度大小和位置排列就应不同的道理。这样就使工人的实际经验和理论结合起来，工人听了之后，都说容易懂，容易学。但是，“耳听不相信，眼见才放心”，有些工人听讲之后，对先进经验仍有抵抗情绪。因此，在讲课之后，马六孩和王占德小组又先后举行实地表演，终于使某些有保守思想的人心悦诚服。老工人赵有在参观马六孩小组表演之后说：“过去我守着那点老技术，不相信人家的经验，这一看，眼睛算亮了。”当技术上懂得了、思想上接受了先进经验之后，各小组紧接着就制订具体的推广计划，并和行政方面订立集体合同，以保证推广计划的实现。这样，在去年八月份，全矿十九个机械掘进小组中，就有四个组超过四百公尺，三个组超过三百公尺，六个组超过二百公尺，掘进效率平均较六月份提高百分之三十到百分之一百五十。其后，工人们又提出：推广马六孩和王占德小组的经验，虽提高了效率，但搬运工和掘进工联系问题还没解决；炮眼打得不深，在夹石煤层中眼不好打。矿的领导方面便进一步采取郭瓦廖夫工作法，吸取赵有小组学习苏联“按指示图表有节奏生产”、盛佃才小组的深孔作业和王守明小组在夹石煤层中打眼等经验，继续举办了几次“先进经验传播班”予以推广。由于这样不断地总结、推广，推广、总结，就使马六孩小组的快速掘进经验更加丰富、完整，最后总结出“马六孩多孔道循环掘进工作法”，同时也就使广大工人对先进经验掌握得更好，推广成绩更大。如刘守仁小组去年十二月下半月才开始使用机械掘进，但今年四月份的月进度就达到了五百五十一点四二公尺，这个进度甚至超过了马六孩小组同月份的进度。
    “先进经验传播班”，这一总结和推广先进经验的组织形式和工作方法，在大同煤矿是经过一段摸索过程才找着的。大同煤矿一九五○年八月开始实行机械化生产后，为了使工人操作技术和工作方法适应机械化的要求，曾开办割煤机、电钻等训练班。但训练班只能帮工人了解一些关于机械的基本理论问题，而工人迫切需要的是工作过程中各个环节的具体经验。于是，去年上半年，就召开了多次先进生产者会议、劳动模范座谈会和工种座谈会，交流生产经验。这些会，由于没有吸收技术人员参加，不能综合、提高工人的经验，工人听了之后感到零乱，知其然不知其所以然；同时，仅限于口头交谈，没有实地参观，不能打破职工中的保守思想。所以，一些先进经验仍停留在某些先进小组中。去年七月，领导方面接受了这一经验教训，提出用“先进经验传播班”来总结和推广先进经验，以迅速提高工人的操作技术和工作方法，充分发挥机械效能。但又遇到不少思想障碍：有些干部认为工人自己就会交流经验，不需要技术人员；部分技术人员认为要提高工人操作技术，就只有抽调工人脱离生产，开办技术训练班。经过几次“先进经验传播班”后，原来一些抱怀疑、反对态度的人都扭转了自己的看法。在一次总结“先进经验传播班”的会议上，总工程师张继英说：“工人的经验不是没用，而是过去我们没去帮助他们总结。”一些原来忽视技术人员作用的人，也认识到没有技术人员的帮助，马六孩他们的经验便不可能总结得那样好。从此以后，一月一次的“先进经验传播班”才逐渐普及到全矿。
