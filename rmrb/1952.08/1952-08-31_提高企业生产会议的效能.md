"Labor Daily" published an editorial on August 9th, pointing out the importance of holding good enterprise production meetings. The following is a summary:

    The wealth of experience accumulated in our industry proves definitively that production meetings are a reliable means of promoting the initiative of the working people. At these meetings, workers criticize shortcomings in labor and production organization, offer their own suggestions, and help discover and utilize new potential. In the process of discussing issues, valuable initiatives are generated, and the exchange of advanced experience is promoted.

    To facilitate work, fundamental production issues, such as how to use machines, how to fight against non-productive waste, how to improve product quality and reduce costs, etc., should be brought up for discussion at production meetings. Bringing these issues to the attention of all personnel can elicit a constant stream of valuable suggestions, unearth new potential, and enhance everyone's sense of responsibility for their work.

    The suggestions, advice, and criticisms offered by workers at production meetings embody their vast practical experience. No detail of this valuable experience should be allowed to go to waste. No critical opinion should be lightly dismissed or ignored. However, in reality, we are still far from implementing all the suggestions made at production meetings and regularly taking measures to eliminate shortcomings as quickly as possible based on critical remarks.

    The responsibility of trade union organizations is to ensure the effectiveness of production meetings. They should raise the issue of those workshop and enterprise leaders who suppress the initiative of competitors with indifference to higher-level economic organizations and trade union organizations. Every instance of a bureaucratic attitude towards valuable suggestions should alert trade union leaders, because neglecting workers' advice and suggestions hinders the development of workers' initiative more than anything else.

    Mass production committees in factories and workshops should establish strict systems to supervise the implementation of suggestions from production meetings. The details of these suggestions should be displayed in prominent places in the workshops, along with the exact dates for their implementation and the names of the responsible individuals. This public registration can enhance the sense of responsibility for implementing the suggestions. It must be understood that activity at meetings can only be enhanced when people see that their appropriate advice is valued and their suggestions are implemented.

    To date, some enterprises have hastily held production meetings without preparation, merely to complete formalities. Furthermore, because these meetings are only held during daytime shifts, the number of participants is artificially reduced. Sometimes the suggestions made at meetings are too general. For example, the Third Textile Workshop of the Furmanov Second Factory in Ivanovo regularly passes resolutions of this kind, which have no concrete constraints: "Work according to charts," "Improve product quality," "Ensure machines are repaired." Of course, such general resolutions cannot bring any benefit.

    Trade union organizations should convene production meetings regularly, not temporarily. They should notify workers of the agenda, location, and time of the meetings in advance. They should encourage foremen, economic personnel, and planners to participate in the discussions. This will make it possible to analyze savings targets more deeply, explain the causes of non-productive waste, and more comprehensively determine the effectiveness of any suggestion.

Preparing for the New School Year
    "Pravda" published an editorial on August 4th entitled "Preparing for the New School Year," excerpts of which are as follows:

    The period of preparation for the new school year is the most important stage in the further improvement of all work in Soviet schools. During this period, school workers summarize the past school year, formulate methods for improving the quality of teaching, and pay attention to the school's preparation of curriculum materials.

    The key to the success of all work in Soviet schools lies first and foremost in the teachers. The people's teachers are held in the greatest respect in our country. Comrade Stalin instructed: "The people's teacher is one of the most necessary parts of the great working people of our country who are building a new life on a socialist basis."

    In August, all regions should hold routine district teacher conferences. The conferences should deeply analyze the summaries of the previous semester, help teachers to start the new school year in an organized manner on the basis of criticism and self-criticism, overcome the shortcomings in their work, and widely adopt the experience of excellent teachers and schools.

    The task of improving the quality of school teaching should be the focus of attention for all workers in national education.

    It is important to ensure that all students receive the necessary textbooks at the start of the school year. The printing of textbooks should be accelerated, and the publication and supply plans for textbooks should be completed in a timely manner. All measures should be taken to ensure that the school's material and technical preparations for the new school year, such as repairing school buildings and providing schools with physical teaching materials, instruments, and teaching stationery, are completed in a timely manner.

    The preparation of schools for the new school year is an important matter for the state. Local Party organizations, Soviets, trade unions, and youth league organizations should regularly care about schools and place the preparation of schools for the new school year under constant social supervision.

    提高企业生产会议的效能
    “劳动报”八月九日发表社论，指出开好企业生产会议的重要，摘要如下：
    我们工业中所累积的大量经验非常确凿地证明：生产会议是发扬劳动人民首创性的可靠手段。在这种会议上，工人们批评劳动和生产组织中的缺点，提出自己的建议并帮助发现和运用新的潜力。在讨论问题的过程中，产生一些宝贵的创议，并促使先进经验得到交换。
    为了有利于工作，应当把生产的根本问题，如怎样使用机器，怎样向非生产性的耗费进行斗争，怎样提高产品质量和降低成本等等问题，提到生产会议上来讨论。使全体人员注意到这些问题，可以引出源源不绝的宝贵建议，发掘新的潜力并提高每个人对工作的责任感。
    工人们在生产会议上所提出的建议、忠告和批评，是他们的大量实践经验的体现。对于这些宝贵经验的任何细节都不应使其落空。对于任何一个批评的意见都不应轻轻放过，或不加注意。但是，实际上，大家现在还远没有做到使生产会议上所提出的各种建议，都付诸实施，并且经常根据批评性的发言，采取以尽快消灭缺点的办法。
    职工会组织的责任是要使生产会议发生效能，它应当向上级经济组织和职工会组织提出那些以冷淡态度压制竞赛者的首创性的车间和企业领导人的问题。凡以官僚主义态度对待宝贵建议的每一事实都应引起工会领导者的警惕，因为漠视工人的忠告和建议比任何事物都更会阻碍工人的首创性的展开。
    工厂和车间的群众生产委员会应当确立严密的制度。监督生产会议的建议的实施，这些建议的条文应当揭示在车间的显著地方，同时并应指出实行这些建议的确切日期和有关负责者的名字。这种公开的登记可以提高实现建议的责任感。必须懂得：只有当人们看到他们的适当的忠告被重视，他们的建议被实施的时候，会议上的积极性才能提高。
    到现在为止，仍有一些企业为了办形式手续，而匆忙地、毫无准备地举行生产会议。此外，由于这种会议只是在日班时间举行，也就人为地缩小了会议参加者的人数。有时会议上的建议过于一般化。例如在伊万诺沃的富尔曼诺夫第二工厂的第三纺织车间，经常通过这类毫无具体约束的决议：“依照图表工作”，“改善产品质量”，“保证修好机器”。当然，这种一般性的决议是不能带来任何好处的。
    职工会组织应当不是临时而是定期地召集生产会议。它应当预先将会议的议程、地点和时间通知工人们。它应当吸引领班、经济人员和计划人员参加问题的讨论。这样才可能更深刻地分析节约指标，说明造成非生产性耗费的原因，并更全面地确定任何一个建议的效果。
    做好新学年的准备
    “真理报”八月四日发表以“做好新学年的准备”
    为题的社论，摘要如下：
    在苏维埃学校全部工作进一步改善的道路上，准备新学年的时期是最重要阶段。在这个期间，学校工作者做出上学年的总结，拟定提高教学工作质量的办法，注意学校对课程的教材的准备工作。
    苏联学校全部工作的成功关键，首先在于教师。人民教师在我国受到最大的尊敬。斯大林同志指示说：“人民教师是在社会主义基础上建设着新生活的我国伟大劳动人民队伍的最必要部分之一”。
    八月间，各地都要举行区的例行教师会议，会议应该根据上学期的总结深刻分析，在展开批评与自我批评的基础上，协助教师有组织地开始新学年，克服自己工作中的缺点，广泛采用优秀的教师和学校的经验。
    提高学校教学工作质量的任务，应当是国民教育全体工作者的注意中心。
    在学年开始时，使全体学生得到所需要的教科书是很重要的。应当加速教科书的印刷工作，及时完成教科书的出版和供应计划。应当采取一切办法，使学校对新学年的物质、技术准备工作如修建校舍，以实物教材、仪器和教学文具供给学校等等得以及时完成。
    学校对新学年的准备工作是国家的重要事情。地方党组织、苏维埃、职工会和青年团组织应当经常关心学校，把学校对新学年的准备工作置于始终不懈的社会监督之下。
