    Editor's Note: In our country, infringing upon human rights is an illegal act. State personnel should lead by example, be law-abiding, and responsibly safeguard the democratic rights of the people. Anyone who infringes upon human rights should be sanctioned. The incident in which Shen Hao, the magistrate of Huairen County, Chahar Province, was punished for illegally detaining Dai Baoqian, a former staff member of the Agriculture and Forestry Section of the Huairen County People's Government, should attract the attention of all state personnel. Leadership organs in all regions should use this incident to educate cadres on safeguarding the democratic rights of the people.

    The case of Shen Hao, magistrate of Huairen County, Chahar Province, abusing his authority and illegally detaining Dai Baoqian, a former staff member of the Agriculture and Forestry Section of Huairen County, has been thoroughly investigated by personnel dispatched by the Chahar Provincial People's Procuratorate, and the truth has been clarified. The Chahar Provincial People's Supervisory Committee has decided to give Shen Hao a demerit of one grade.

    Dai Baoqian, a former staff member of the Agriculture and Forestry Section of Huairen County, was transferred to work in Huairen County on January 6th of this year. Because his revolutionary worldview had not yet been established, he wanted to engage in revolution but was afraid of hardship, and he was never at ease in his work. Therefore, when his hemorrhoids relapsed in late February, he repeatedly requested a long leave to return home (Tianjin) for treatment. At that time, the "Three-Anti" movement was in full swing, and Gu Qin, the head of the Agriculture and Forestry Section, and Shen Hao, the county magistrate, believed that his illness was not serious, so they did not approve his request for leave and asked him to be treated locally. However, he insisted on leaving, saying, "My illness cannot be cured here. Whether you let me go or not, I will leave." He also said, "I may or may not return after I leave." Under these circumstances, County Magistrate Shen Hao asked Yuan Shaozhi, a staff member of the Personnel Section, to consult the Personnel Section of the Yanbei Special District to see how to handle this issue. Feng Qihan, a staff member of the Personnel Section of the Special District, replied: "If the explanation is ineffective, he may be approved to leave the job." Therefore, on February 19th, the County Personnel Section issued Dai a departure certificate, allowing him to return to Tianjin.

    On May 21st, Dai Baoqian personally went to Huairen County to request reinstatement and to obtain his relevant档案 material. On the 22nd, Dai Baoqian found Shen Hao for this purpose. Shen Hao replied, "It is impossible to continue working. The government cannot allow people to come and go as they please; the档案 material are kept by the government and cannot be given to an ordinary citizen. If you find a job, the government can transfer the materials to you." Seeing that the problem could not be solved, Dai Baoqian's attitude became a little unfriendly, saying, "Can't I solve any problem after traveling back and forth in vain?" Shen Hao was also a little irritated, saying, "Who told you to come?" As a result, the two began to argue with each other, making unfounded arguments. Dai Baoqian questioned Shen Hao: "Why don't you treat cadres when they are sick? Is this how you, as county magistrate, are irresponsible to cadres?" Shen Hao also flew into a rage: "What are you doing, acting like a hooligan in the government!" Dai Baoqian became even angrier, saying, "Why do you, as a county magistrate, swear at people?" Shen Hao became even more annoyed, saying, "I swore at you, go to the Special District to sue me!" Dai Baoqian said, "You are a bureaucrat!" Shen Hao said:
    "I am a bureaucrat, get out of here!" Dai Baoqian said, "I won't leave even if you send me to the court!" At this time, Shen Hao recklessly said, "Okay! I'll send you to the court!" As he spoke, he ordered the communication orderly to tie up Dai Baoqian. After Dai Baoqian was tied up, his attitude softened, and he asked Shen Hao and Yuan Buli, the secretary of the county government, to untie him and not send him to the court, expressing his willingness to admit his mistakes. But Shen Hao ignored him, wrote a note, stamped it with the county magistrate's seal, and ordered the communication orderly to send Dai Baoqian to the court.

    During Dai Baoqian's detention, the county repeatedly consulted the Personnel Section of the Yanbei Special District by telephone. Feng Qihan, a staff member of the Personnel Section of the Special District, did not consult the section chief on whether it was appropriate to handle such an important issue in this way, but made a reply without authorization, and did not report to the section chief afterwards. This is a serious act of disorganization and indiscipline.

    After the incident occurred, County Magistrate Shen Hao neither formally reported to his superiors nor took further action. Even when Lu Fenggang, a cadre from the Provincial Public Security Department who was working in the countryside to clear up backlog cases, criticized his approach, he ignored it. After the Huairen County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this incident, it convened a county party committee meeting on the 26th, decided to immediately release Dai Baoqian, and ordered Shen Hao, as a member of the county party committee, to write a written self-criticism. However, Shen Hao did not implement the county party committee's decision after the meeting, neither releasing Dai Baoqian nor writing a self-criticism, saying something like "I won't make a self-criticism even if you expel me from the Party." It was not until March 2nd that he released Dai Baoqian under pressure from all parties. At this time, Dai Baoqian had been illegally detained for as long as twelve days. Afterwards, with the urging and assistance of the higher authorities, Shen Hao gradually realized his mistakes and made a profound self-criticism at the county-level agency cadre meeting. Zhu Chuanshi, a staff member of the County People's Government, said, "This incident has greater educational significance for those of us who have worked in the old society. In the past, no one would dare to say it was wrong if superiors punished subordinates more severely than this; now, the magistrate of the People's Government cannot break the law."

    In this province-wide movement to learn from the lessons of the Zhang Shunyou incident and universally examine bureaucracy in Chahar, this incident was re-exposed. Although Dai Baoqian himself has some shortcomings, this does not in any way offset the seriousness of the mistakes committed by County Magistrate Shen Hao. Entrusted by the people, Shen Hao, as the county magistrate, not only did not abide by the law and set an example in complying with the government's policies and laws, but instead abused his authority, violated human rights, and demonstrated a full-fledged bureaucratic style and privileged mentality. In order to educate himself and all cadres, the Chahar Provincial People's Supervisory Committee decided, with the approval of the Provincial People's Government, to give Shen Hao a demerit of one grade. Feng Qihan, a staff member of the Personnel Section of the Yanbei Special District, was also given a demerit for his disorganization and indiscipline in handling this incident.

    怀仁县县长沈浩非法扣押戴宝谦受到处分
    编者按：在我们的国家里，侵犯人权是违法的行为。国家机关工作人员应以身作则，奉公守法，并负责地保障人民的民主权利。谁要侵犯人权，谁就应该受到制裁。察哈尔省怀仁县县长沈浩非法扣押前怀仁县人民政府农林科科员戴宝谦而受到处分的事件，应引起全体国家工作人员的注意。各地领导机关都应该以这个事件来向干部进行保障人民民主权利的教育。
    察哈尔省怀仁县县长沈浩滥用职权、非法拘押怀仁县前农林科科员戴宝谦一事，经察哈尔省人民检察署派员认真调查，事实真相已经弄清。察哈尔省人民监察委员会已决定给予沈浩以记大过一次的处分。
    怀仁县前农林科科员戴宝谦，今年一月六日调到怀仁县工作。由于他的革命人生观尚未确立，心里想革命，但又怕吃苦，工作一直不安心。因此，当二月下旬他的痔疮病复发后，便几次要求请长假回家（天津）医治。当时正在“三反”运动紧张时期，农林科科长顾勤、县长沈浩等认为他的病并不严重，所以没有批准他请假的要求，让他在本地治疗。他却坚持要走，说：“这里治不了我的病，让走也走，不让走也走。”并说：“走后也许回来，也许不回来。”在这种情况下，县长沈浩便让人事科科员袁绍芝请示雁北专署人事科，看如何处理这一问题。专署人事科科员冯启汉答覆：“如解释无效，可批准他离职。”于是，二月十九日，县人事科便给戴开了离职证，让他回到天津。
    五月二十一日，戴宝谦亲自到怀仁县要求恢复工作，并要索取有关他的档案材料。二十二日戴宝谦为此找到了沈浩。沈浩回答说：“继续工作不可能。政府，不能随便想来就来，想走就走；档案材料由政府保存，也不可能随便给一个老百姓。如果找到工作，政府可以给你把材料转去。”戴宝谦见问题不能解决，态度便有点不好，说：“难道我徒劳往返，就不能解决一点问题吗？”沈浩也有点动气，说：“谁叫你来的？”于是，双方便互相强词夺理地争吵起来。戴宝谦质问沈浩：“为什么干部病了你不给治？你这个县长就这样对干部不负责任？”沈浩也大发雷霆：“你来政府耍什么赖皮！”戴宝谦越发生气，说：“你当县长为什么随便骂人？”沈浩也更加恼火，说：“我骂了你啦，你到专署告我去吧！”戴宝谦说：“你这个官僚主义！”沈浩说：
    “我就官僚，你给我走！”戴宝谦说：“你送我法院我也不走！”此时沈浩竟放肆地说：“好！就送你去法院！”说着便命令通信员把戴宝谦捆了起来。戴宝谦被捆后，态度软下来，向沈浩和县府秘书袁步礼请求把他解开，不要送法院，表示愿意承认错误。但沈浩没有理会，写了个便条，盖上县长的手章，命通信员把戴宝谦送法院去了。
    在戴宝谦被押期间，县里曾用电话向雁北专署人事科数次请示。专署人事科科员冯启汉对于处理这样重要的问题这样处理是否妥当不请示科长，擅自作了答覆，而在事后也没有向科长报告。这是一种严重的无组织无纪律行为。
    事情发生后，县长沈浩既没有向上级正式报告，也没有作进一步的处理。甚至当省公安厅下乡清理积案的干部吕凤岗对他这种做法提出批评时，他还是置之不理。中共怀仁县委发觉这一事件后，在二十六日召开了县委会议，决定立即将戴宝谦放出，并责成作为县委委员的沈浩写书面检讨。但会后沈浩并没有执行县委的决议，既没有释放戴宝谦，也没有写检讨，并说什么“开除我的党籍我也不检讨”。直到三月二日，他才在各方催促下把戴宝谦释放。此时戴宝谦已被非法拘押达十二天之久。之后，又经过上级的督促帮助，沈浩才逐渐认识了自己的错误，在县级机关干部大会上作了深刻的检讨。县人民政府工作人员朱传诗说：“这件事对我们在旧社会作过事的人，有更大的教育意义。过去上级处分下级，比这再重也没人敢说不对；现在人民政府的县长，犯了法也不行。”
    在这次察哈尔全省各地接受张顺有事件的教训，普遍检查官僚主义的运动中，这一事件被重新揭发出来。虽然戴宝谦本人有些缺点，但这丝毫也不能抵消县长沈浩所犯错误的严重性。沈浩受人民的委托，身为县长，不但不奉公守法，以身作则地遵守政府的政策法令，反而滥用职权，侵犯人权，表现了十足的官僚主义作风和特权思想。为教育其本人和全体干部，察哈尔省人民监察委员会决定并经省人民政府批准，给沈浩以记大过一次的处分。雁北专署人事科员冯启汉在处理这一事件中，表现了无组织无纪律，也给予记过处分。
