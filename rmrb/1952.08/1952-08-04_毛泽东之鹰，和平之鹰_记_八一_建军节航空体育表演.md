    Mao Zedong's Eagles, Eagles of Peace
    ——A Record of the August 1st Army Day Aviation Sports Performance
    Lin Gang
    A clear sky. The azure sky, boundless and cloudless, is more vast and unfathomable than the ocean. The morning sun shines brilliantly on the airport, filled with a festive atmosphere. The Five-Star Red Flag, the "August 1st" Army Flag, and countless red flags are waving everywhere in the wind. Today – August 3rd, the aviation sports athletes of New China are holding our country's first aerial acrobatic performance and parachute jump performance here. This is a moving program of the August 1st Army Day Sports Meeting. Thousands of the capital's working people are crowded around the runway, dressed in brightly colored costumes, waiting eagerly for the appearance of "Mao Zedong's Eagles."
    At exactly 9:00 AM, the commander-in-chief announced the start of the aviation sports performance. The noisy voices quieted down, and tens of thousands of eyes searched the blue sky. With the roar of engines, three green divine eagles – Mao Zedong's Eagles – formed a "pin" character formation, flying neatly and low past the reviewing stand, paying tribute to the leaders and expressing welcome to the people of the capital. Each cockpit of the aircraft had a red flag inserted, fluttering in the wind. When the audience discovered that the leading red flag was embroidered with a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, a storm of applause and cheers immediately erupted on the ground, lasting for a long time. In our era, all creation and happiness are inseparable from the name of Chairman Mao. In order to express our love and respect for our great leader, the creator and leader of the people's aviation cause – Chairman Mao Zedong, the people of our country affectionately call the divine eagles of the motherland "Mao Zedong's Eagles" – Eagles of Peace. They vigilantly defend the sacred airspace of the motherland. They opened up new air routes over the Kangzang Plateau. They bombed the ice dams of the Yellow River. They participated in the work of surveying the Northeast Shelterbelt. They transport fine breeds of Donghu fish fry to various places and help farmers eliminate locust plagues. They carry peaceful people freely flying around in the sky of the motherland.
    The aviation sports performance is divided into two parts: aerial acrobatics and parachute jumping. The names of the eight aviation sports athletes participating in this aerial performance are: Liu Heqiao, Ding Jinzhang, Wang Qinli, Li Guangqing, Tang Yuan, Chen Zhiyuan, Cao Faliang, and Lu Lanqiao. The vast majority of them are sons of workers and peasants. The first program of the aerial acrobatics was a solo performance by Ding Jinzhang, the son of a carving worker and a young aviation athlete. His golden airplane performed complex skills in the clear sky – continuously looping, rolling, flying inverted, and diving. The second program was a formation aerial acrobatics performance, led by aviation athlete Wang Qinli. He is a member of the Communist Youth League. In August 1951, the aircraft he was flying went to Anci and Wuqing counties in Hebei Province to exterminate locusts. Wang Qinli was still a student at Fu Jen Catholic University when Beijing was liberated. From a young age, he loved sports and developed a strong physique, which prepared important conditions for him to become a pilot later. From his student days, he yearned to soar freely in the blue sky of the motherland, determined to dedicate himself to the aviation cause of the motherland. This dream was finally realized in the Mao Zedong era. Three airplanes constantly changed formations, performing excellent collective aerial acrobatics in the air, sometimes circling and looping, sometimes rolling, sometimes flying inverted, sometimes ascending in a straight line, always maintaining a certain interval and distance, as coordinated and consistent as one airplane. Finally, the two airplanes behind followed the front one in a spiral descent from an altitude of 800 meters, drawing a spiral line with an extremely extended pitch in the sky. The young flying athletes demonstrated their skillful techniques and precision.
    Now, a hazy black dot appears on the transparent horizon in the distance, gradually expanding from far to near. This is a fiery red fighter jet. The pilot is Liu Heqiao, the captain of the aerial acrobatics performance team, the son of a tenant farmer and a Communist Party member. He is only twenty-three years old. The speed of the fighter jet is so fast that people's eyes often cannot keep up with it. At a moment when people are inadvertently distracted, it dives into the airport with an agile posture. The performance begins, the airplane rolling its fuselage horizontally around its longitudinal axis, while rushing towards the sky in a straight line like a rocket. Then, it flips halfway over in the sky, its belly facing the sky, and somersaults along an arc with a diameter of 600 meters from high altitude. Using the same technique, the airplane then draws two huge circles tangent to each other in front of us, reaching to the sky and the ground, with a powerful momentum. This is a vertical figure-eight stunt. The audience unanimously cheered madly for the unparalleled bravery of "Mao Zedong's Eagles," for the young pilot's skillful technique and fearless courage. At this time, the airplane sped directly into the high altitude like lightning, and suddenly, in a flash when people's eyes did not even have time to see its movements clearly, it quickly switched direction by 180 degrees, speeding back along the same flight path it had come from! It was simply like being bounced back by a spring of infinite power. The audience was attracted by this flying stunt, everyone holding their breath. The performance continued, the fiery red fighter jet rolling and looping as lightly as a swallow, and once again performed the vertical figure-eight stunt. Then, sometimes flying inverted, sometimes obliquely rising straight into the sky. Finally, a heart-pounding scene appeared again, it dived down from an altitude of 1,700 meters, its nose pointing straight down to the ground. It was not until it was close to the ground that it suddenly raised its head, alternately rolling from side to side, its engine singing a majestic song straight into the sky. Its shadow disappeared in the deep and distant clear sky in an instant.
    In our country, the sons of workers and peasants have become excellent pilots. The skillful and accurate movements of the acrobatic performance fully demonstrated the extraordinary courage, high intelligence, and excellent academic achievements of workers and peasants. When young people from worker and peasant backgrounds began to learn aviation, it was very difficult because they lacked education. However, what difficulties can stop the will of Communist Party members and the awakened workers and peasants? "Everything for the prosperity of the motherland!" Supported by this noble idea, their spirit of studying and learning was ten times stronger. While learning culture, they also learned flight theory. After a short period of training, they understood the basic principles of flight and mastered flight techniques. Our country's superior new democratic system has opened up broad prospects for workers and peasants, and their creative talents and wisdom can be developed without limit.
    The parachute jump performance began at 9:40 AM. The airport returned to silence at this time. A silver transport plane slowly flew from south to north. When flying over the airport, it dropped five peanut-sized black particles. The five "peanuts" fell vertically and rapidly towards the ground. Only after descending to a height of one or two hundred meters did the parachutists leisurely open their parachutes, and then the parachutes slowly descended into the wind. This was a delayed parachute jump performed by five outstanding parachutists. After flying around the outside of the airport for a week, the transport plane re-entered the airspace above the airport. This time, it was the parachute jump performance by female parachutists (six of whom were students who participated in the military cadre school the year before last). Ten female parachutists jumped out of the cabin almost within two seconds. The snow-white parachutes, set off by the blue sky, looked extremely beautiful. The parachutes were filled with wind, and the young female parachutists calmly manipulated the parachute cords, facing away from the wind, drifting and descending in mid-air. When landing, they brought their feet together, squatted down with the momentum, and stood up. The skillful technique demonstrated extraordinary training. The entire audience could not help but feel proud of these brave daughters of the motherland.
    Finally, five transport planes flew in, one higher than the other in order, forming an oblique "one" shape, flying to the airspace above the airport. At the same location, one hundred parachutists jumped down one after another. The sky was suddenly densely covered with countless colorful parachutes, white, red, yellow, blue, green, orange..., the entire airspace above the airport seemed to be covered with a riot of color.
    Amidst the enthusiastic cheers of the entire audience, the parachutists ran to the front of the reviewing stand. They were all wearing parachutist uniforms and parachutist helmets, with a short knife slung diagonally across their waists. Thirty of them were armed with submachine guns. They were performing a fully armed parachute jump. The parachutists were radiant and extremely healthy, their faces blackish red. Cui Hanqing, the captain of the parachute jump performance team and the first parachutist in New China, reported to the commander-in-chief: "All parachutists have landed safely." Then, the enthusiastic audience rushed over like a raging wave, tightly wrapping the parachutists. Volunteer Army soldiers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, government cadres, young workers, male and female students, and Young Pioneer members presented them with flowers, hugged them, and kissed them wildly, picking up the female parachutists and throwing them into the air. The scene of enthusiastic cheers lasted for a long time.
    The aviation sports performance ended with a large-scale collective parachute jump performance.
    The wonderful program of more than an hour left people with a deep and unforgettable impression. In order to exercise the body, defend the motherland, and defend peace, our country will widely develop aviation sports. The first aviation sports performance will have a huge impact among the vast number of young people in our country. Our country has countless outstanding young people who aspire to "dedicate themselves to the aviation cause of the motherland." They are paying close attention to the growth of the pioneers of aviation sports. From now on, they are cultivating their excellent political qualities and strong bodies. In the happy Mao Zedong era, the ideals of our young people will surely be realized. They are the aviation sports athletes of tomorrow.
    Mao Zedong's Eagles – Eagles of Peace soar bravely in the vast sky of the motherland, faithfully defending the airspace of the motherland and the happy life of the people of the motherland. The development and strengthening of our country's aviation cause will greatly enhance the power to defend world peace. Peace is always invincible.

    毛泽东之鹰，和平之鹰
    ——记“八一”建军节航空体育表演
    林钢
    晴朗的天。蔚蓝色的天空，万里无云，比海洋还要辽阔和深不可测。朝阳灿烂地照耀着充满节日气氛的机场。五星红旗、“八一”军旗和数不清的红旗，到处迎风招展。今天——八月三日，新中国的航空体育运动员们在这里举行我国第一次飞行特技表演和跳伞表演。这是“八一”建军节体育运动大会的一个动人的节目。跑道周围挤满了成千上万的首都劳动人民，他们穿着色彩鲜艳的盛装，怀着热切的心情等候“毛泽东之鹰”的出现。
    上午九时正，总指挥宣布航空体育表演开始。嘈嚷的人声静寂下来，千万双眼睛向碧空探索。随着马达的轰响，三架绿色的神鹰——毛泽东之鹰，组成“品”字队形，整齐地在检阅台前低飞而过，向首长们致敬，向首都人民表示欢迎。飞机的座舱上面，各插着一面红旗，迎风腊腊作响。当观众发现为首一架的红旗上绣着毛主席的巨像时，地面上立即煽起了暴风骤雨般的掌声与欢呼，经久不息。在我们这个时代，一切创造和幸福都是和毛主席的名字分不开的。为了表示对于我们伟大的领袖、人民航空事业的创造者和领导者——毛泽东主席的热爱与崇敬，我国人民把祖国的神鹰昵称为“毛泽东之鹰”——和平之鹰。它警觉地捍卫着祖国神圣的领空。它开辟了康藏高原的新航线。它轰炸黄河冰坝。它参加勘察东北防护林带的工作。它运送东湖优良品种的鱼苗到各地、帮助农民消灭蝗灾。它载着和平的人们自由地在祖国的天空飞来飞去。
    航空体育表演共分两个部分：飞行特技和跳伞。参加此次飞行表演的八个航空体育运动员的名字是：刘鹤翘、丁锦章、王溱礼、李广庆、唐渊、陈志远、曹发良和鲁蓝桥。他们绝大多数是工农的儿子。飞行特技的第一个节目是雕刻工人的儿子、青年航空运动员丁锦章的单机表演。他的金黄色的飞机在晴空里表演了复杂的技巧——连续地翻筋斗、横滚、倒飞和俯冲。第二个节目是编队飞行特技表演，由航空运动员王溱礼领导。他是一个青年团员。一九五一年八月，他所驾驶的飞机曾至河北省安次、武清两县灭蝗。王溱礼在北京解放时还是辅仁大学的学生，从小喜欢运动，锻炼成了一副强壮的体格，给他以后当飞行员准备了重要的条件。从学生时代起他就神往于自由地翱翔在祖国碧蓝的天空，立志献身祖国的航空事业。这个梦想在毛泽东时代终于实现了。三架飞机不断变换着队形，在空中表演着出色的集体飞行特技，忽而回翔着翻筋斗，忽而横滚，忽而倒飞，忽而直线上升，始终保持着一定的间隔和距离，如同一架飞机般的协同一致。最后，后面两架飞机随着前面一架从八百公尺高空作螺旋式下降，在天空中画出了一道螺距极端延长的螺旋线。年青的飞行运动员们显示了自己的纯熟的技巧和精确性。
    现在，在远方透明的天边出现了一个矇眬的黑点，自远而近，逐渐扩大。这是一架火红色的战斗机。驾驶者是飞行特技表演队队长刘鹤翘，佃农的儿子，共产党员。他只有二十三岁。战斗机的速度是那样快，以致于人们的眼睛常常赶不上它。它在人们偶不经意之际，以矫捷的姿态俯冲进入了机场。表演开始，飞机一面围绕自己的纵轴横着机身打滚，一面成直线地像火箭般向天空冲去。然后，在天空里翻半个身，肚皮朝着天，自高空沿着有六百公尺直径的圆周的弧线，鹞子大翻身地翻了个大筋斗。用同样的技法，飞机接着在我们面前画出两个弧线相切的巨大的圆形，上顶天，下接地，气贯长虹。这是垂直“8”字特技。观众一致狂热地为“毛泽东之鹰”的无比神勇而欢呼，为青年飞行员熟练的技术和无畏的勇敢而欢呼。飞机这时又风驰电掣地直入高空，突然，在人们的眼睛都来不及看清楚它的动作的一刹那，它迅速地转换了一百八十度的方向，沿着飞去时的同一航线疾驶回来，不！简直像是被一根无限威力的弹簧弹了回来的。观众被这一飞行绝技所吸引了，个个屏息静气。表演继续着，火红色的战斗机像燕子般轻巧地打着滚和翻着筋斗，又一次表演了垂直“8”字特技，然后，一忽儿倒飞，一忽儿又斜刺地向天空直升。最后，再度出现了一个惊心动魄的场面，它从一千七百公尺的高空，机头向下朝地直栽的俯冲下来，临近地面的时候，才猛然翘起头来，左右交替地打着横滚，马达高唱雄壮的歌声向天空直冲而去。它的影子转瞬间便消失在深而远的晴空里。
    在我们的国家里，工农的儿子当了优秀的飞行员。特技表演娴熟、准确的动作，充分显示了工农劳动者非凡的勇敢、高度的智慧和优良的学习成绩。工农出身的青年，开始学习航空的时候，因为没有文化，是很艰难的。然而什么困难可以阻住共产党员和觉悟了的工农劳动人民的意志呢？“一切为了祖国的强盛！”在这一崇高的思想支持下，他们钻研学习的精神十倍地顽强。边学文化，边学飞行理论，经过短短时间的训练，便通晓了飞行的基本原理，掌握了飞行技术。我国优越的新民主主义制度替工农劳动人民开辟了广阔的前途，他们的创造才能与智慧，可以得到无限止的发展。
    跳伞表演于九时四十分开始。机场此时重又归于寂静。一架银色的运输机自南往北地徐徐飞过。飞到机场上空时，它丢下来了五个落花生般大的黑粒粒儿。五颗“落花生”垂直地急速地向地面降落，下降到一二百公尺以后，跳伞运动员们才不慌不忙地把伞打开来，然后伞迎着风缓缓下降。这是由五个卓越的跳伞运动员表演的迟缓跳伞。运输机在机场外面绕飞一周后，再度进入机场上空。这一次是女跳伞运动员们（她们当中有六个是前年参加军事干校的学生）的跳伞表演了。十个女跳伞运动员几乎是在二秒钟内全部跳出了机舱，雪白的降落伞，被蓝天衬托着，显得美丽极了。降落伞鼓满了风，青年女跳伞运动员们安详地操纵着伞带，背向着风，在半空里飘飘荡荡地下降。着陆的时候，双脚并拢，身子顺势往下一蹲，就站立起来了。娴熟的技术显示了非凡的训练。全场观众莫不为祖国这些勇敢的女儿们感到骄傲。
    最后飞来了五架运输机，顺序一架高过一架，编成斜写的“一”字，飞至机场上空。在同一地点，先后跳下来一百名跳伞运动员。天空中顿时密布无数五彩缤纷的降落伞，白的、红的、黄的、蓝的、绿的、橙的……，整个机场上空好像开遍了万紫千红的花朵。
    在全场观众热烈的欢呼声中，跳伞运动员们跑步来至检阅台前，他们一律穿戴着跳伞服和跳伞帽，腰间斜佩一柄短刀。其中三十名手执着冲锋枪，他们是全副武装跳伞的。跳伞运动员神彩奕奕，身体健壮极了，脸色黑里见红。跳伞表演队长、新中国第一名跳伞员崔汉卿向总指挥报告：“跳伞人员全部安全降落”。于是，热情的观众像狂澜似地奔来，紧紧地裹住了跳伞运动员们，志愿军战士、解放军战士、机关干部、青年工人、男女学生、少年儿童队员们向他们献花、拥抱、狂吻，把女跳伞运动员们抱起来，抛到半空中。热烈欢呼的场面长久地持续着。
    航空体育表演在大规模的集体跳伞表演中结束。
    一个多钟头的精彩节目留给人们深刻难忘的印象。为着锻炼身体，保卫祖国，保卫和平，我国将要广泛地发展航空体育运动。首次航空体育表演在我国广大青年之间，将会发生十分巨大的影响。我国有着无数把“献身祖国的航空事业”作为志愿的优秀青年，他们怀着极大的注意关怀着航空体育运动的开拓者们的成长。他们从现在起就在培养自己优良的政治品质和健壮的身体。在幸福的毛泽东时代，我国青年们的理想必定可以得到实现。他们是明天的航空体育运动员。
    毛泽东之鹰——和平之鹰神勇地翱翔在祖国辽阔的天空，忠诚地捍卫着祖国的领空和祖国人民幸福的生活。我国航空事业的发展与壮大，必将大大地增强保卫世界和平的力量。和平永远不可战胜。
