The Story of "Red Army Ancestor"
　　Lao Chen

I'm going to tell a story about the "Red Army Ancestor" here. This story is circulating among the people of Panjiahe in Xunyang County, Shaanxi Province. It once inspired the people of Panjiahe to fight heroically against the enemy, and it was also used by the people as a weapon to fight against the enemy.

In the spring of 1934, Sun Guang, the battalion commander of a certain unit of the Red Twenty-fifth Army (now the commander of the Shangluo Military Sub-district in Shaanxi), led a guerrilla force of more than one hundred people (which later grew to more than three hundred) to Panjiahe. The guerrilla force took Jiulong Mountain in Panjiahe as its base, destroyed the Kuomintang's township offices, and controlled an area of ​​hundreds of miles around Panjiahe. It confiscated the property of twelve landlords and bullies, including Zeng Mingshun (because of the urgency of time, the land was not divided), and distributed it to more than two thousand poor peasants. From this time on, people began to sing red songs: High mountains cannot block the sun, the dark night will pass and the sky will dawn; the flood is rolling and making waves, the Communist Party has come to Panjiahe. The birth of the Communist Party shakes the foundation, and the demon dynasty is in turmoil. When the sun comes out, the red glow is rosy, and the water of Panjiahe rolls over silver flowers. Flowers bloom, fruits are borne, everyone is happy and laughs; fight the local tyrants, eliminate the evil gentry, and the fruits of labor return home. Heavens above, earth below, the suffering people have help; [Note 1] the Communist Party is the true emperor, the kindness of the emperor is better than parents. The water of Panjiahe rustles, and to turn over, you must rely on the Communist Party.

The singing, like a torrent, flowed from upper Panjiahe to lower Panjiahe, all the way to the border between Zhen'an County and Yunxi County in Hubei Province. The tide of people's revolution was stirring up.

In this red guerrilla force, there was a doctor surnamed Gao. People affectionately called him "Old Gao". This Old Gao is the origin of the "Red Army Ancestor". "Without money, it's hard for a doctor to come to your door." In the past, countless people in Panjiahe died or became disabled because they could not afford medical treatment. From the day the red guerrilla force arrived in Panjiahe, Old Gao, this respectable Communist Party member, worked day and night to treat the people. In more than a year, he successively cured more than one hundred peasants of sores and other diseases, without taking a penny. The measles that was prevalent locally also came to an end at this time. People called Old Gao "Enlightened Divine Doctor". The most unforgettable thing was that when he was treating a poor old woman surnamed Liu for typhoid fever, he stayed in the thatched shed for four days and four nights, finally bringing the dying old woman Liu back to life. Usually, Old Gao tirelessly educated the peasants, patiently cultivated activists, and fought against the landlord class together with the masses. The people of Panjiahe said: "Old Gao is a good example of the Communist Party; the Communist Party is the savior of the suffering people." This idea was deeply buried in the hearts of the people of Panjiahe.

In September 1935, on an unfortunate day, this red guerrilla force was surrounded by Ai Guangqing's reactionary self-defense regiment of Yunxi County, Hubei Province, and Zhang Deyi's self-defense force of Six Lines Township in Xunyang County at the Foyemiao Temple on Jiulong Mountain. More than three hundred people were surrounded tightly. After a fierce battle, one morning, the Red Army broke through. During the breakout, Doctor Gao and a Red Army soldier surnamed Cui heroically sacrificed at the same time. Grief invaded the hearts of everyone in Panjiahe. People cried like they had lost their relatives. The corpses of Doctor Gao and the Red Army soldier surnamed Cui were buried by the people of Panjiahe in the land of a farmer surnamed Cao in Nianzigou. From this day on, the people of Panjiahe fell into the fire pit again. Ai Guangqing and Zhang Deyi's counter-revolutionary self-defense force carried out a "major purge." The landlords' lackeys, armed with guns, took back the fruits that the peasants had gained in the revolution, and emptied the homes of the peasants who had been given the landlords' property. Activists in the revolutionary struggle, such as Xiang Xuebang and Li Bencheng, were imprisoned and brutally beaten. The landlords' activities of forcing rent and forcing "top hand" (deposit) became even more vicious.

Although the Red Army retreated, the people of Panjiahe did not forget the struggle. They firmly remembered what Battalion Commander Sun Guang of the Red Army said when he left: "We will be back! As long as everyone unites and struggles, victory will eventually be ours!" From then on, people constantly struggled for survival, and at the same time, they hung a plaque of "Red Army Ancestor" in front of Doctor Gao's tomb, using myths to spread the influence of the Red Army. Thus, the myths that "the Red Army lived for the poor, and will bless the poor even after death" and "the Red Army Ancestor is powerfully responsive" spread. People used seeking medical treatment as a pretext to burn incense and worship at Doctor Gao's grave, taking the opportunity to publicize the benefits of the Red Army. The myths became more and more magical, and more and more people came to burn incense. Peasants in the areas of upper and lower Panjiahe, Maoping, Guojiagou, and other areas within a radius of two or three hundred miles were attracted. At first, some people came purely to make wishes and seek medical treatment; but while seeking medical treatment, they received propaganda and education, and their thoughts gradually turned towards revolution and embarked on the road of struggle. In order to carry out organized struggle, the local people established the "Red Army Ancestor Incense Association," and the peasant Lin Zhengrong became the head of the association. The masses agreed to renovate the Red Army's tomb and renamed Nianzigou "Red Army Gully." The tomb was enlarged, the worship platform was repaved, flagpoles stood like a forest on both sides of the tomb, and cypresses were planted all around. The plaque of "Every Request is Answered" was hung up.

With the prosperity of the "incense," the peasants met to brew struggles. In the autumn of 1939, there was a drought, and peasants in Panjiahe generally launched a movement against grain, against taxes, and against rent. The landlords, bullies, and reactionary self-defense forces searched for grain from house to house. The peasants hid the grain in the mountains. The pigs and cattle of more than thirty peasant households were taken away by the enemy. The reactionary township head Zhang Deyi discovered the political significance of the peasants' propaganda of the "Red Army Ancestor's" power in the search for grain, so he mobilized his lackeys to suppress the peasants. More than two hundred reactionary self-defense force members spread throughout Panjiahe, using guns to threaten the peasants, forbidding them from burning incense and making wishes to the "Red Army Ancestor". Reactionary announcements were posted everywhere, which wrote: "Those who go to the 'Red Army Ancestor's' grave will be fined two dou of rice per person; those who meet to go to the grave will be punished as 'Red Army riots', and severely punished." After this, the people of Panjiahe no longer burned incense and worshiped openly during the day, but at night and at dawn, people still went to the grave to pray. Doctor Gao and the Red Army will always live in the hearts of the people of Panjiahe. Every night, children gathered in groups of three or five in the moonlight to sing nursery rhymes, pouring out the suffering of the people of Panjiahe and recalling the Red Army: Old Mother Moon, round and round, shedding tears in the middle of the night; Daddy's eyes are swollen from crying, Mama's voice is hoarse from crying. Red Army Uncles, since you left, we poor people have nothing to rely on anymore. The water in the river flows endlessly, the bitterness in my heart cannot be expressed; tears roll down and wet the pillow, when will the days of suffering come to an end. Mountains upon mountains are layered high, our grievances are higher than the mountains. No reliance, no worries, we are like a stone falling on a thorn bush; wolves in front, tigers behind, foxes and dogs bully us; lackeys collect grain from house to house, tying us with ropes and ropes. The storm and dark clouds will not last long, the sun will come out when the wind blows; the lamp in front of the wind cannot be lit, the night is only one night long; I hope the Red Army Uncles will come back soon, we will clap our hands here. Righteousness suppresses evil, evil will be subdued, and the "stick guests" [Note 2] will be destroyed; doves and gulls, you fly fast, bring our wishes to the Communist Party: You say that the children of Panjiahe have lost their mothers, and the melon that leaves the seedling is difficult to grow.

In the autumn of 1940, peasants in Maoping and Guojiagou sculpted two statues of Red Army soldiers in gray uniforms sitting in two mountain caves. People worshiped and made offerings all day long, still calling them "Red Army Ancestor"; and renamed those two mountain caves "Red Army Ancestor Cave". During the same period, peasants in Hongyan also sculpted a "Red Army Ancestor" statue in "Hongyan Temple," and the temple was renamed "Red Army Ancestor Temple." There was also a gathering on the fifteenth day of October every year, called the "Red Army Ancestor Fair." Every time the fair was held, thousands of peasants came to worship the "Red Army Ancestor." In the autumn of 1941, the influence of the "Red Army Ancestor" extended to the border between Yunxi and Zhen'an counties. The people on the border between Yunxi and Zhen'an counties also sculpted "Red Army Ancestor" statues in Huoshigou and Ya'erdong. The influence of the Red Army, like a monthly rose, bloomed redder and redder in the hearts of the people on the border of Xunyang, Yunxi, and Zhen'an counties.

With the support of peasants in Hongyan, Maoping, Guojiagou, and other places, the people of Panjiahe launched struggles against grain, against taxes, against rent, and against conscription in the autumn of 1941. Young men organized "Home Guard Teams," dispersed in the mountains and forests during the day, and patrolled and stood guard at night to protect the villages. The landlords' rents were dragged down softly, and the puppet land tax grain and township and village public expense grain were delayed in payment. Old men and women "cried poverty" everywhere. The struggle became more acute when the enemy came to conscript soldiers in October. One night, Zhang, the puppet village deputy, brought five lackeys to conscript soldiers in Huayuan Village. The people knocked them down into the river. Zhang Deyi, the puppet township head, was angered and led more than two hundred self-defense force members to carry out a major purge in the mountains, arresting eight young peasants in Huayuan Village and torturing them severely. When the news reached Maoping and Hongyan, peasants from both places gathered at the "Red Army Ancestor" temples in both places to protest. The enemy became even more frantic, surrounding the "Red Army Ancestor" temple in Hongyan one night. In the pitch-black night, the assembled peasants injured six lackeys with wooden sticks and broke through. The enemy rushed to the temple, destroyed the "Red Army Ancestor" statue, and the next day arrested people everywhere, imprisoning more than a dozen innocent peasants. The "Red Army Ancestor" statue in Maoping was also destroyed by the lackeys, and the temple was torn down.

Panjiahe became the red heart of the people on the border of Xunyang, Zhen'an, and Yunxi counties. Its every breath touched the people in the area within a radius of two or three hundred miles. In order to suppress the people on this land, the enemy increased a battalion of troops. Taxes and grain were increased, and the landlords' rent and deposits were also increased. The "Red Army Ancestor" grave was not allowed to be worshiped anymore; but people wrote "Red Army Ancestor Shows Great Power" on a piece of red paper and enshrined it at home, praying every morning and evening: People don't know relatives, the poor know relatives, everyone thinks of the Red Army in their hearts; white clouds fly by, thinking of relatives, looking up at the sky until their eyes turn red. "Red Army Ancestor" bless us, but hope that the savior will return soon. Every road leads to Yan'an, Yan'an is the heart of the people; the mountains are high and the road is far, it is difficult to travel, telling our suffering to the sky. Red Army, Red Army, don't forget, Panjiahe is now a big fire pit.

The more violently the enemy oppressed, the more courageously the people of Panjiahe struggled. And through the tempering of the struggle, the people understood the tactics of the struggle even more. In 1945, the people of Panjiahe launched an even larger-scale struggle. This struggle changed its form. At the beginning of the struggle, people carried out more than a month of political education and propaganda offensive in the puppet self-defense force through social relations. More than one hundred of the more than two hundred members of the puppet self-defense force changed their thinking and leaned towards the people. It was summer harvest, the landlords urged rent, the township office requisitioned grain, the self-defense force was only outwardly obedient, and most of the rent and grain requisitioned were dragged down. Activities to promote the "Red Army Ancestor" were reactivated. On October 15th, the "Red Army Ancestor Incense Association" was restored. Zhang Deyi drove the self-defense force to monitor and suppress the revolutionary activities of the people, but the self-defense force did not satisfy Zhang Deyi. Zhang Deyi personally came out to suppress, and was hit in the head by a flying cold stone one night. He fired his pistol randomly, injuring two peasants, and ordered the puppet self-defense force to arrest the peasants. The next day, thousands of petitioning peasants from Hongyan, Maoping, Panjiahe, and other places swarmed to the Six Lines Township Office. Zhang Deyi was forced to release the arrested peasants and promised to reduce grain and rent. The struggle of the people of Panjiahe was victorious, and an immortal stone monument was erected on the grave of the "Red Army Ancestor".

The sound of liberation reached Shuhekou (a place name on the border between Shaanxi and Hubei), the Red Army is back! Panjiahe raised the cheers of the people. From the winter of 1947 to the winter of 1948, the outposts of three or four guerrilla teams came and went in the Shuanghe, Panjiahe, and Shuhekou areas. The people of Panjiahe were busy sending grain, carrying stretchers, and making military shoes, supporting their own troops and attacking the enemy. In the summer of 1949, the People's Liberation Army, advancing westward from Yunyang, Hubei, arrived at Shuhe. The enemy fled at the sight of the wind. The people of the Panjiahe area, together with the guerrillas, seized the guns of the "stick team". Finally, in the Xishahe area, the enemy's E'bao Fourth Regiment and Ninety-eighth Brigade all surrendered to our army. The people were victorious, and Panjiahe was at peace.

In the three years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of Panjiahe have carried out movements such as rent reduction and anti-bullying, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance to America and aid to Korea, and land reform. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the people recovered decades of blood debts. Sun Bin, the evil reactionary ringleader who had brutally suppressed the revolutionary activities of the people of Panjiahe in those years, was publicly tried and executed. Ai Guangqing, the mastermind who surrounded and attacked the guerrillas, also fell in front of the masses. Zhang Deyi fled, and people are trying to capture him. Grievances have been avenged, land has returned home, and suffering will never return.

The "Red Army Ancestor" has taken root in the hearts of the people in the Panjiahe area, and it is becoming more and more consolidated day by day. Now, whenever the "Red Army Ancestor" is mentioned, people say with a smile: "At that time, we worshiped the 'Red Army Ancestor' like our own ancestors. We knew that the Red Army would grow from small to large. If there is a root, it will grow a trunk, grow branches, bloom, and bear fruit. Calling the Red Army Old 'Ancestor' is what it means." The revolutionary sparks have already spread across the wilderness. Now, the people of Panjiahe have won victory, and Panjiahe is full of red flags of production, which are also red flags of victory.

[Note 1] "Dabang" means backing.
[Note 2] "Stick guest" is the contemptuous name of the people of Panjiahe for the reactionary self-defense force.

    “红军老祖”的故事
    老沉
    我这里讲一个“红军老祖”的故事。这故事流传在陕西省洵阳县潘家河一带的人民中间。它曾经鼓舞着潘家河一带的人民向敌人英勇斗争，也曾经被人民用作向敌人进行斗争的武器。
    一九三四年春天，红二十五军某部的孙光营长（现在是陕西商雒军分区司令员）带着一支一百多人
    （后来发展到三百多人）的游击队来到了潘家河。游击队以潘家河的九龙山为根据地，摧毁了国民党的乡公所，控制了潘家河一带百十里地的地区，没收了曾明顺等十二家地主恶霸的财物（因为时间仓促，没有分田），分给了两千多贫苦农民。从这时起，人们唱起了红色的歌曲：山高遮不住太阳，黑夜过去天要亮；洪水滚滚掀波浪，潘家河来了共产党。共产党出世地基动，妖魔王朝齐动荡。太阳一出红霞霞，潘家河的水浪翻银花。开了花，结了瓜，个个欢喜笑哈哈；打土豪，除劣绅，劳动的果实回了家。天皇皇，地皇皇，苦难的人民有搭帮；〔注一〕共产党是真人皇，人皇的恩情赛爹娘。潘家河水哗啦啦的响，要翻身得靠共产党。
    歌声像激流一样，从上潘家河流向下潘家河，一直流向镇安县和湖北省郧西县的边界。人民革命的浪潮掀动起来了。
    在这支红色游击队中，有一位姓高的医生。人们都亲切地喊他为“老高”。这位老高，就是“红军老祖”的起源。“没钱大夫难上门”，潘家河一带过去不知有多少人因为没钱治病而死亡，或变成残废。从红色游击队到达潘家河的那天起，老高，这位可敬的共产党员，就日夜不断地为人民治病。一年多的时间，先后医好了一百多个农民的疮和别的病，分文不取。当地流行的麻疹，也在这时断了根。人们都称老高为“得道神医”。最令人难忘的，是他在给一个姓刘的孤老婆婆医治伤寒病的时候，整整在茅草棚里守了四天四夜，终于使奄奄一息的刘老婆婆活转过来。平时，老高不倦地教育农民，耐心地培养积极分子，并和群众一起向地主阶级进行斗争。潘家河的人民都说：“老高是共产党的好样子；共产党是苦难人民的救星。”这种思想深深地埋进了潘家河人民的心底。
    一九三五年九月，不幸的一天，这支红色游击队被反动的湖北省郧西县艾光清的自卫团和洵阳县四行乡的张德义自卫队包围在九龙山的佛爷庙。三百多人被围得水泄不通。经过激战之后，在一个早晨，红军突围了。在突围的时候，高医生和一个姓崔的红军战士同时壮烈牺牲。悲痛侵袭着潘家河每个人的心。人们像失掉了亲人一样嚎啕大哭。高医生和姓崔的红军战士的尸体，被潘家河的人民掩埋在碾子沟一个姓曹的农民的地里。从这一天起，潘家河的人民又陷入了火坑。艾光清和张德义的反革命自卫队来了一次“大清乡”，地主的爪牙们荷枪实弹，把农民在革命中得到的果实又抢回去了，并把分得地主财物的农民的家搜刮一空。革命斗争中的积极分子向学榜和李本成等十二人被禁闭起来，遭到残酷的吊打。地主们逼租、逼着上“顶手”
    （押金）的活动也更凶恶了。
    红军虽然撤退了，但潘家河的人民却没有忘记斗争。他们牢记着红军临走时孙光营长所说的话：“我们还会回来的！只要大家团结一致地进行斗争，胜利终久是我们的！”从那时起，人们为生存而不断地进行斗争，同时在高医生的坟墓前挂起“红军老祖”的匾额，利用神话来传播红军的影响。于是，
    “红军活为穷人，死也会保佑穷人”，“红军老祖威灵显应”的神话传播开了。人们以求医为名，在高医生的坟前烧香祭奠，借机宣扬红军的好处。神话越来越神奇，烧香的人也越来越多。上下潘家河、毛坪、郭家沟等方圆两三百里地区的农民，都被吸引了来。开始，有人是单纯来许愿求医；但在求医时受到宣传教育，思想都逐渐倾向革命，走上斗争的道路。为了进行有组织的斗争，当地人民成立了“红军老祖香火会”，农民林正荣当了会首。群众公议兴修红军坟墓，把碾子沟改为“红军沟”。坟墓垒大了，拜台重新铺过，坟墓两旁旗杆如林，四周栽了柏树，“有求必应”的匾牌挂了起来。
    随着“香火”的兴旺，农民便约会酝酿斗争。一九三九年秋天干旱，潘家河一带的农民普遍掀起了抗粮、抗款、抗租的运动。地主恶霸们和反动自卫队一起，挨门挨户地搜索粮食。农民把粮食藏到山里。三十多户农民的猪牛被敌人拉走了。反动乡长张德义在搜粮中发现了农民们宣扬“红军老祖”威灵的政治意义，于是调集爪牙，对农民实行镇压。二百多人的反动自卫队撒布在潘家河，用枪威吓农民，不准向“红军老祖”烧香许愿。反动布告到处张贴，上面写着：“凡上‘红军老祖’坟者，单独的每人罚米二斗；约会上坟者以‘红军暴动’治罪，严惩不贷。”这以后，潘家河的人民没有在白天公开烧香祭奠的了，但在夜里和拂晓时分，人们仍然上坟祷告。高医生和红军永远活在潘家河人民的心中。每到夜晚，孩子们三五成群地在月光下唱着歌谣，倾吐着潘家河人民的苦难，追忆着红军：月老娘，圆巴巴，半夜三更泪洒洒；爹爹哭肿了眼，妈妈把嗓子都哭哑。红军伯伯自从你走后，咱穷人没啥再靠挂。河里的水流不尽，心里的苦情说不清；眼泪滚滚湿了枕头，苦难的日子啥时才到头。山叠山来层层高，咱们的冤仇比山高。没依靠，没牵挂，咱好比石头掉在刺枯架；前是狼，后是虎，狐群狗党来欺压；爪牙挨户强收粮，绳捆索绑整得辣。暴雨乌云不久长，风吹之时会出太阳；风前的灯来点不亮，黑夜不过是一夜长；但愿红军伯伯早回来，咱们这里拍巴掌。正压邪来邪要降，棒子客〔注二〕来要灭亡；鸽子鸥子你飞得快，把咱的心愿捎给共产党：你说潘家河的孩没了娘，离秧的瓜儿难成长。
    一九四零年秋天，毛坪和郭家沟的农民又在两座山洞里塑起了两个穿灰军服的红军战士坐像。人们成天敬拜供奉，仍称为“红军老祖”；并把那两个山洞改称“红军老祖洞”。同一时期，红岩的农民也在“红岩寺”塑了一个“红军老祖”像，其寺庙就改称为“红军老祖庙”。每年十月十五日还有集会，叫“红军老祖会”。每逢过会的时候，有成千的农民前来敬拜“红军老祖”。一九四一年秋天，“红军老祖”的影响扩展到了郧西和镇安两县的边界。郧西和镇安两县边界的人民，也在火石沟和垭儿洞塑起了“红军老祖”像。红军的影响像月季花一样，一月比一月更红地怒放在洵阳、郧西、镇安三县边界人民的心中。
    潘家河人民在红岩、毛坪、郭家沟等地农民支援下，一九四一年秋天又发动了抗粮、抗款、抗租税和反抗抓丁的斗争。年青的小伙子组织起“保家队”，白天疏散在山林里，夜晚巡逻放哨，保卫村庄。地主们的租子被软拖下来，伪田赋粮、乡保公费粮也拖延不交。老汉、老婆们到处“叫穷”。十月间敌人来拉壮丁的时候，斗争更尖锐了。一个晚上，伪乡队附张某带了五个爪牙在花园村拉壮丁，人民把他们打倒在河里。伪乡长张德义恼了，率领着两百多名自卫队实行大清山，逮捕了花园村的八个青年农民，严刑拷打。消息传到毛坪和红岩，两地的农民同时在两地的“红军老祖”庙前集会，实行抗议。敌人更疯狂了，在一个晚上包围了红岩的“红军老祖”庙。在伸手不见五指的黑夜里，集会的农民用柴棒打伤了六个狗腿子，突围了。敌人赶到庙里，把“红军老祖”像毁掉，第二天又张牙舞爪地到处捕人，把十几个无辜的农民关进了牢狱。毛坪的“红军老祖”像也被爪牙们捣毁了，庙被扒了。
    潘家河成了洵阳、镇安、郧西三县边界人民的红色心脏。这里的一呼一吸牵动着方圆两三百里地区的人民。敌人为镇压这块土地上的人民，增加了一个大队的兵力。款粮更加重了，地主们的租粮和押金也加重了。“红军老祖”坟不许祭奠了；但人们用一张红纸条写上“红军老祖大显威灵”的牌位，供奉在家里，每天早晚祷告：人不知亲穷知亲，个个心里念红军；白云飞过想亲人，仰天看穿了红眼睛。“红军老祖”多保佑，但望救星早回临。条条路通向延安城，延安城是人民的心；山高路远难通行，望空祷告诉苦情。红军红军你别忘记了，如今潘家河是个大火坑。
    敌人越压榨得凶，潘家河人民的斗争越勇猛。而且经过斗争的锻炼，人民更懂得了斗争的策略。一九四五年，潘家河的人民掀起了更大规模的斗争。这次的斗争改变了方式。斗争开始，人们通过社会关系，在伪自卫队中进行了一个多月的政治教育和宣传攻势，两百多人的伪自卫队，有一百多人思想起了变化，倾向人民。夏收了，地主们催租，乡公所征粮，自卫队在其中只是阳奉阴违，租粮、征粮大部被拖了下来。秋收时，反动派要征的一百多石田赋粮，只收起了二十多石。宣扬“红军老祖”的活动也重新活跃起来。十月十五日，“红军老祖香火会”又恢复了。张德义驱使自卫队监视、镇压人民的革命活动，但自卫队并没有使张德义满意。张德义亲自出马来镇压，在一个晚上被一块飞来的冷石头打破了头。他拿着手枪乱打，打伤了两个农民，又命令伪自卫队逮捕农民。第二天，红岩、毛坪、潘家河等地上千请愿的农民拥向了四行乡公所，张德义被迫释放了被捕的农民，并答应减粮减租。潘家河人民的斗争胜利了，“红军老祖”的坟墓上树起了一块永垂不朽的石碑。
    解放的炮声响到了蜀河口（陕西、湖北交界处一地名），红军回来了！潘家河扬起了人民的欢呼声。一九四七年冬天到一九四八年冬天，三四支游击队的前哨出入在双河、潘家河、蜀河口一带。潘家河的人民忙着送粮，出担架，做军鞋，支援自己的队伍，打击敌人。一九四九年夏天，经湖北省郧阳西进的人民解放军开到了蜀河。敌人望风而逃。潘家河一带的人民和游击队一起，收缴了“棒子队”的枪枝。最后在西沙河一带，敌军鄂保四团和九八旅全部向我军缴械。人民胜利了，潘家河太平了。
    解放后的三年多来，潘家河的人民在共产党和人民政府领导下，开展了减租反霸、镇压反革命、抗美援朝、土地改革等运动。在镇压反革命运动中，人民讨还了几十年的血债。万恶的反动头子、当年残酷镇压过潘家河人民革命活动的孙斌，被公审枪决了。当时围打游击队的主使人、反革命分子艾光清，也在群众面前倒了下去。张德义逃跑了，人们正设法捉拿。冤仇报了，土地回了家，苦难一去不复返了。
    “红军老祖”在潘家河一带人民的心中扎下了根，而且一天比一天巩固。如今一提到“红军老祖”，人们就笑着说：“当时我们供奉‘红军老祖’就像自己的祖先一样。我们知道红军是会由小到大的。有根，就会长干、生枝、开花、结果，称红军老‘祖’，就是这个意思。”革命的星星之火，已经烧遍了原野。现在，潘家河的人民胜利了，潘家河满山遍野都飘着生产的红旗，也是胜利的红旗。
    〔注一〕“搭帮”即靠山的意思。〔注二〕“棒子客”，是潘家河一带人民对反动自
    卫队的鄙称。
