    Further Development and Improvement of the North China Propaganda Network
    Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    The Party's propaganda network work in the North China region has been further developed and improved during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the patriotic production increase campaigns in industry and agriculture. According to incomplete statistics from the five provinces and two municipalities in North China, the number of Party propagandists has increased to 971,400, accounting for 1.4 percent of the total population of the region. This is an increase of more than 381,600 people compared to the end of last year. Currently, 80 to 90 percent of Party branches in each province and city have established propaganda networks. The mass propaganda force has also greatly developed.

    In the past six months, Party organizations in various provinces and cities in the North China region have carried out partial rectification of the Party's propaganda network during various movements, purging corrupt and degenerate elements as well as other impure elements, making the organizational members more pure and capable. The leadership system of Party committees at all levels over the propaganda network has also been improved. For example, systems such as propagandist representative meetings, propagandist meetings, and propaganda training have generally been maintained. The leadership methods of the propaganda network have also been created and improved. Therefore, the proportion of propaganda networks that regularly play a role has increased. For example, in Chahar, the proportion of rural propaganda networks that regularly play a role has increased from 20 percent last year to 34 percent now, and urban propaganda networks have increased from 30 percent last year to 60 to 70 percent now.

    In the development of propaganda network work, organizing competitions for propaganda network work is one of the leading methods to comprehensively consolidate and improve propaganda network work. The Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the basis of previous evaluations of model propagandists, organized propaganda network work competitions in May of this year. Currently, 300 to 400 branches across the province have launched challenges and responses, launching a heated propaganda competition. This competition not only requires every Party grassroots organization and propagandist to exert a high degree of enthusiasm, but also requires Party committees at all levels to improve and strengthen political and ideological leadership over the propaganda network. The development of propaganda network work competitions has not only directly and powerfully promoted the patriotic production increase and economy drive, but also comprehensively consolidated and improved propaganda network work. However, this type of competition has not been widely carried out in the North China region.

    In order to regularize propaganda network work, in addition to improving the leadership system, the following key aspects should also be grasped: First, implement the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, regularly inspecting patriotic pacts and production plans, as well as other central tasks. Since the Second District Ninth Police Station in Beijing created the "Resist America, Aid Korea Inspection Day" for street residents last year, and the Weishe Village in Pingding, Shanxi, created the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, provinces and cities in North China have paid attention to promoting this system among urban residents and in rural areas. Shanxi Province has already had 30 percent of its branches leading the masses to establish this system. Experience in various places—especially in Shanxi—proves that wherever this system is established, it greatly enriches the political life of the rural masses, raises the patriotic thinking of farmers, gives play to the role of patriotic pacts, and enables various tasks to be carried out smoothly. The establishment and maintenance of this system also promotes the regularization of propagandist activities. Second, promote reading groups. Reading newspapers is a propaganda method that can be carried out regularly and is loved by the masses. Reading groups in the North China region have greatly developed this year. Tianjin has more than 12,400 groups. Suiyuan Province has more than 10,200 groups. Shanxi Province has the fastest development and the largest number of reading groups, with 100,000 groups and 1.5 million members. Among them, Changzhi and Yuci prefectures are doing the best, and most counties have achieved village-by-village reading groups. The masses say, "When newspapers arrive in the village, the masses are happy, and work is energetic." Because most of the reading groups in Shanxi Province are developed in conjunction with mutual aid teams, the masses also say, "Sitting down is a reading group, standing up is a mutual aid team." Most reading groups are led by propagandists or have propagandists as the backbone. Therefore, reading newspapers has become the main content of propagandists' regular activities. At the same time, it is also one of the basic ways for propagandists to strengthen their self-education. Third, develop mass propaganda forces. Since the North China Bureau issued a circular on the experience of Daming County, Hebei, in developing mass propaganda forces, Party organizations in various places have attached importance to the work of establishing mass propaganda forces and have achieved certain results. Mass propaganda organizations in Hebei generally have these two types: One is reading groups, broadcasting groups, village theater troupes, and propaganda teams without fixed division of labor that are established and active independently. This type of organization exists everywhere and is the most numerous. The other is a comprehensive propaganda team with a system and division of labor, uniformly led by the village cultural and educational committee. This form is more common in Daming County, Hebei. Both of these mass propaganda teams have the unified leadership of the Party and have propagandists as the backbone, giving play to the role of mass propaganda organizations.

    At present, there are still some problems in the Party's propaganda network work in the North China region: First of all, the leadership system is not yet sound enough. For example, there is a lack of regular and systematic investigation and research on the ideological situation of the masses; a lack of in-depth and specific inspection of propaganda network work; and a lack of specific assistance to propagandists. This is more obvious in the leadership of county and district Party committees and more urgently needs to be resolved. Secondly, the ideological level and propaganda ability of propagandists cannot fully meet the needs of the work. For example, the masses say that the propagandists' propaganda is "old-fashioned," and the propagandists also feel that they "have nothing to say," and their enthusiasm is not high. Some also speak carelessly and make mistakes. The establishment of the propaganda network is not balanced. There are still 10 to 20 percent of branches in the region that have not established a propaganda network, and in individual areas (such as Tongxian Prefecture in Hebei), more than 30 percent of branches have not been established. Some branches have been established, but there are too few propagandists to meet the needs of the work. Among the propaganda networks that have been established in rural areas, about 20 percent have little or no effect. Party committees at all levels have not yet summarized and promoted the experience of factory and mine propaganda network work well. In order to overcome these shortcomings and further advance propaganda network work, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward the following guiding principle for the construction of the propaganda network in the future: The Party's propaganda network should focus on consolidation and improvement, and make necessary developments. The mass propaganda force should continue to develop and strengthen the Party's unified leadership. Regarding the consolidation and improvement of the Party's propaganda network, the North China Bureau specifically pointed out that Party committees at all levels should grasp the following key aspects: (1) Improve the leadership system. In addition to adhering to the various systems for leading the propaganda network stipulated by the Central Committee, it is necessary to emphasize improving the ideological research system, inspection system, and training system of county and district Party committees. Necessary rectification should be carried out for the speakers, leadership should be strengthened, and experience should be created. (2) Train and educate propagandists. In addition to conducting centralized training and general training for propagandists, Party committees at all levels should also organize propagandists to study on their own to improve their ideological level and working ability. (3) Enrich the content of propagandists' activities. Special attention should be paid to promoting the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system, developing reading groups, and mass propaganda forces in all urban and rural grassroots organizations. Regarding the development of the propaganda network, the North China Bureau requires that all factory and mine branches should establish a propaganda network this year, and those that have already been established should be appropriately developed again. The number of propagandists in all larger factories and mines should be developed to no less than 5 percent of the total number of employees in order to meet the requirements of propaganda and mobilization work penetrating into production. Branches in rural areas that have not established a propaganda network should be established this year; those with too few should be appropriately developed; each mutual aid team and agricultural production cooperative should have a propagandist. The mass propaganda force should generally seek further development and expansion and be rectified and improved. However, the Party's unified leadership must be strengthened.

    华北宣传网工作进一步发展和提高
    中共中央华北局宣传部
    华北区的党的宣传网工作，在“三反”、“五反”运动和工、农业爱国增产运动中，有进一步的发展和提高。据华北五省二市的不完全统计，党的宣传员已发展到九十七万一千四百余人，占全区人口总数的百分之一点四。比去年年底增加了三十八万一千六百多人。各省、市目前均有百分之八十至九十的党支部建立了宣传网。群众宣传队伍也有很大发展。
    半年来，华北区各省、市的党的组织，在各项运动中，对党的宣传网进行了部分的整顿，清洗了贪污蜕化分子以及其他不纯分子，使组织成员更加纯洁和精干。各级党委对宣传网的领导制度也更加健全，例如，宣传员代表会议、宣传员会议、宣传传授等制度一般都能坚持。宣传网的领导方法，也有所创造和改进。因此，经常起作用的宣传网比例增加。如察哈尔农村宣传网经常起作用的由去年的百分之二十增加到现在的百分之三十四，城市宣传网由去年的百分之三十增加到现在的百分之六十至七十。
    在发展宣传网工作中，组织宣传网工作的竞赛，是全面地巩固和提高宣传网工作的领导方法之一。中共山西省委宣传部在过去的评选模范宣传员的基础上，在今年五月份组织了宣传网工作竞赛，现全省已有三、四百个支部发起挑战、应战，展开了热烈的宣传竞赛运动。这一竞赛不仅要求每个党的基层组织和宣传员发挥高度的积极性，同时要求各级党委健全和加强对宣传网的政治思想领导。宣传网工作竞赛的开展，不仅直接有力地推动了爱国增产节约运动，而且使宣传网工作也得到全面的巩固和提高。但是华北区尚未普遍开展这种竞赛。
    为了使宣传网工作经常化，除了要健全领导制度外，还应抓住下列几个环节：首先推行“爱国检查日”制度，定期检查爱国公约和生产计划及其他中心工作。自去年北京市二区第九派出所创建了街道居民的“抗美援朝检查日”和山西平定维社村创建了“爱国检查日”制度以来，华北各省、市均曾注意了在城市居民中及农村中推广这种制度，山西全省已有百分之三十的支部领导群众建立了这一制度。各地——特别是山西的经验证明：凡是建立了这一制度的，便大大地充实了农村群众的政治生活，提高了农民的爱国主义思想，发挥了爱国公约的作用，使各种工作都能得到顺利的开展。而这一制度的建立和坚持，又促进了宣传员活动的经常化。其次，推广读报组。读报是能够经常进行而又为群众所喜爱的宣传方式。华北区的读报组今年有很大的发展。天津市已有一万二千四百多个组。绥远省已有一万零二百多个组。山西省读报组发展最快，数目也最多，全省已有十万个组，组员达一百五十万人。其中尤以长治、榆次两专区作得最好，大部县份已达到村村有读报组。群众说“报纸到了村，群众开了心，工作起了劲”。由于山西省的读报组大部分是结合互助组发展的，所以群众又说：“坐下是读报组，站起来是互助组”。读报组大部是以宣传员为领导的，或以宣传员为骨干的，因此读报工作就成了宣传员经常活动的主要内容。同时，也是宣传员加强自我教育的基本方式之一。第三，发展群众宣传队伍。自华北局通报了河北大名县发展群众宣传队伍的经验以后，各地的党组织都重视了对于建立群众宣传队伍的工作，并已取得一定的成绩。河北的群众宣传组织大体有这两种类型：一种是单独建立、单独活动的读报组、广播组、村剧团以及无固定分工的宣传队等。这种组织，各地都有，数量最多。另一种是由村文教委员会统一领导的、有制度、有分工的综合宣传队，这种形式在河北大名县较普遍。这两种群众宣传队，都有党的统一领导，有宣传员作为骨干，发挥了群众性的宣传组织的作用。
    目前华北区的党的宣传网工作中，还存在着一些问题：首先是领导制度还不够健全。例如：缺乏经常的系统的对群众思想情况的调查研究；缺乏对宣传网工作的深入具体检查和对宣传员的具体帮助等。这在县、区两级党委领导上比较明显，也更迫切需要解决。其次宣传员的思想水平和宣传的能力还不能完全适应工作的需要。例如群众说宣传员的宣传“老一套”，而宣传员也感到“无话可说”，情绪不高。也有的信口开河，发生了错误。宣传网的建立还不平衡，全区还有百分之十至二十的支部尚未建立宣传网，个别地区（如河北通县专区）还有百分之三十以上的支部未建立。有的支部虽已建立，但宣传员太少，不能适应工作需要。在农村已建立的宣传网中，约有百分之二十左右的宣传网，起作用很小或完全不起作用。各级党委对厂矿企业宣传网的工作经验，还未很好地加以总结和推广。为了克服这些缺点，并把宣传网工作向前推进一步，中共中央华北局提出了今后的建设宣传网的方针：党的宣传网以巩固和提高为主，并作必要的发展。群众宣传队伍要继续发展，并加强党的统一领导。对于巩固提高党的宣传网问题，华北局具体指出，各级党委应抓住如下几个环节：（一）健全领导制度。除坚持中央所规定的有关领导宣传网的各项制度外，要强调健全县、区两级党委的思想研究制度、检查制度和传授制度。对报告员应作必要的整顿，加强领导，并创造经验。（二）训练教育宣传员。各级党委对宣传员除进行集训、普训外，还应组织宣传员自己学习，以提高其思想水平和工作能力。（三）充实宣传员的活动内容。要特别注意在一切城市、农村的基层组织中推广“爱国检查日”制度、发展读报组和群众宣传队伍。对于发展宣传网问题，华北局要求所有厂矿企业支部今年都应建立宣传网，已建立的应再作适当发展。一切较大厂矿的宣传员应发展到不低于职工总数的百分之五，以适应宣传鼓动工作深入到生产中去的要求。农村中凡未建立宣传网的支部，应在今年内建立起来；数量太少的应适当发展；各互助组、农业生产合作社均应有宣传员。群众宣传队伍，一般应再求发展扩大，并予以整顿提高。但须加强党的统一领导。
