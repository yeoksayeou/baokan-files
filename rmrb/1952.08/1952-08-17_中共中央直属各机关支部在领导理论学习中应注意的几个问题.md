Several Issues that Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs' Branches Should Pay Attention to When Leading Theoretical Study
    Zeng San

    The Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs (hereinafter referred to as "Central Direct") have already begun studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." How should the Central Direct organs' branches lead this study? Based on the "Branch Work Outline" passed by the First Party Congress of the Central Direct organs last year, I offer the following suggestions:

    I. Leading and organizing the study of organ personnel is the primary task of organ branch work.

    In recent years, the Central Direct organs' branches have regarded leading and organizing the cultural, political, and theoretical study of organ personnel (both Party members and non-Party members) as their primary task. This is also stipulated in the "Branch Work Outline."

    The "Branch Work Outline" stipulates: Party branch work in organs is political and organizational work; do not confuse Party branch work in organs with the administrative work of the organs. Like our Central Direct organs, the staff are all state personnel and belong to the working class. Why do we still need political work? We need political work, on the one hand, to ensure the completion of administrative tasks, and on the other hand, to educate organ personnel. We know that although organ personnel all belong to the working class, they come from all strata of society and are constantly influenced by various strata. In fact, there are impure thoughts. Therefore, it is necessary to raise their class consciousness and consolidate the Party organization of the organs and strengthen the combat effectiveness of the Party organization of the organs through such education. That is to say, we must use the ideology of the working class, the ideology of Marxism-Leninism, to overcome the non-working-class and non-Marxist-Leninist ideas in the minds of the staff. Therefore, leading and organizing the study of organ personnel is the primary task in political work and the primary task in the entire branch work. Comrade Liu Shaoqi taught us that we should raise the organization and leadership of study to the height of political work. This instruction has extremely profound significance, and we must resolutely implement it. Years of experience have shown that the personnel of organs that have grasped the key link of leading study have vigorous vitality, and have made rapid progress in both business and ideology.

    II. Strengthening unified and centralized activities is the key to ensuring good theoretical study.

    "Party branches of the Central Direct organs should, as a principle, carry out Party activities in as unified and centralized a manner as possible." This is stipulated in the "Branch Work Outline." In this work of leading and organizing the study of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," we must act in accordance with this regulation. Why is such a regulation necessary? Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Party":

    "The Party Constitution stipulates: In a factory, mine, rural area, enterprise, street, organ, and school, no matter how many Party members there are, from three Party members to thousands of Party members, only one unified Party organization is established, which becomes the basic organization of the Party and becomes the fighting fortress of the Party in the masses of this factory, mine, organ, school, etc. The basic organization of the Party is generally called the Party branch, and specially called the Party general branch or the Party factory, organ, and school committee. Within the Party branch, the method of organizing Party members into several groups should be adopted, which is convenient and useful for work, but the role of the groups should not be overemphasized. Many tasks should not be decentralized to the groups, but should be carried out by the branch in a unified and centralized manner. Only those tasks that are inconvenient to be carried out by the branch in a centralized manner should be decentralized to the groups." ("On the Party," page 128. Emphasis added by the author.)

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report was made at the Seventh National Congress of the Party in 1945. Due to our lack of practical experience, for a long time, some of our organ branches did not give due attention to this instruction of Comrade Liu Shaoqi. In the winter of 1948, Comrade Liu Shaoqi specially emphasized this point at a general branch meeting of the Central Direct organs. At that time, we actually mistakenly regarded the Party group as the basic organization of the Party, and therefore pushed many tasks to the groups. Some organs divided the branches too small, and the branch activities there were actually equal to group activities. Now the Central Direct organs are more expanded and concentrated than in the past, and this instruction is even more important for us. This backward and decentralized mode of activity can no longer be allowed to continue. Now we have basically realized the importance of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's instruction, so the above-mentioned clear regulations are made in the "Branch Work Outline."

    Resolutely implementing this provision is an important key to organizing the study of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." It is not a simple task to organize thousands of cadres to study such a scientific masterpiece as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" within a year. Our organs have been concentrated in the convenient city of Beijing. If we still use the past methods in rural areas and do not regard the Central Direct organs as "one organ," do not conduct studies in a unified way, and do not concentrate the guiding forces, but let each department act on its own and conduct studies in a decentralized manner, then we will definitely not learn well, or at least some organs will not learn well. Therefore, it is entirely necessary for the Party Committee of the Central Direct organs to uniformly stipulate the study steps and methods, and to conduct centralized guidance and answer questions. In this way, thousands of comrades participating in the study, under the leadership of a Party Committee of the Central Direct organs and with the help of a collective guiding force, are studying at the same time, inspiring and promoting each other, and may achieve relatively good results. Therefore, I believe that in order to enable the Central Direct organs to study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" according to plan, we must strengthen unified and centralized branch activities and strengthen the unified and centralized leadership of the Party Committee over study.

    III. What should the General Branch Committee (or Directly Subordinate Branch Committee), Branch Committee, and Group Leader do?

    The overall plan for studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," inviting people to make enlightening reports, answering difficult questions, etc., has been or will be uniformly stipulated and carried out by the Party Committee of the Central Direct organs. What should the General Branch Committee or the Directly Subordinate Branch Committee do? I think their task is to specifically implement the study plan of the Party Committee of the Central Direct organs. Specifically, there are about the following aspects:

    (1) Understand the cultural, political, and theoretical level of the staff of the organ, mobilize them to participate in the study, and strive to learn well; at the same time, correctly organize the classes. When conducting study mobilization and class organization, on the one hand, it is necessary to oppose the idea of "aiming too high," and on the other hand, it is also necessary to oppose the idea that individual comrades who can participate in the advanced group study dare not participate.

    (2) Understand the study situation, study progress, study results, and problems that occur in the study (if a study group is established, it can be carried out through or in cooperation with the study group leader), and organize timely and effective guidance work. Organize and lead the work of the tutor (or tutor group).

    The task of the organ study tutor, according to the regulations of the Party Committee of the Central Direct organs, is: "A. Convey the opinions of the Party Committee's guiding group on carrying out the study and guide the study of this unit; B. Help the comrades participating in the study answer questions." Establishing and training study tutors is still a brand-new task for our Central Direct organs; the General Branch or Branch Committee must constantly help these tutors, discuss work methods with them, provide them with work conveniences, help them summarize experiences, etc.; this work cannot be handed over to the education committee member alone.

    (3) Conduct attendance work on the comrades participating in the study through the Branch Committee or the Party Group Leader, such as whether they have studied on time and seriously, whether they have taken notes, and whether there are any ideological deviations in the study, etc.

    According to the "Branch Work Outline," the Branch Committee under the General Branch also has an education committee member. The task of this education committee member is to be responsible for checking and supervising various studies under the plans stipulated by the Party Committee of the Central Direct organs and the General Branch Committee. However, he is not mainly responsible for checking the degree of understanding of various issues in the study; this responsibility should mainly be borne by the General Branch Committee. Only when the residence of this branch is too far from the General Branch does the education committee member there have more responsibilities—not only responsible for attendance, but also responsible for helping the General Branch Committee check everyone's understanding of various issues in the study.

    In order for the General Branch Committee or the Directly Subordinate Branch Committee to uniformly and centrally lead and organize various studies, the work of the education committee member must be strengthened. Some organs have cultural and educational sections or education sections. Such departments should actually become assistants to the education committee member; some organs have many tutors, and they should be organized to become powerful assistants to the education committee member; it is best to use both assistants and divide the work and cooperate. If neither of these two conditions is met, the following two methods can be adopted to strengthen the work of the education committee member: either increase the number of education committee members, or separate several educations and set up one education committee member for each. Some organs organize the study group leader and the study tutor and establish a "task force" under the leadership of the education committee member. This method can also strengthen the work of the education committee member, so it can also be adopted.

    I believe that this division of labor between the Organ Party Committee, the General Branch Committee (Directly Subordinate Branch Committee), the Branch Committee, and the Group Leader in leading and organizing theoretical study is necessary.

### 中共中央直属各机关支部在领导理论学习中应注意的几个问题

    中共中央直属各机关支部在领导理论学习中应注意的几个问题
    曾三
    中共中央直属各机关（以下简称中直）已经开始学习“毛泽东选集”了。中直各机关支部应该怎样来领导这一学习呢？根据去年中直机关第一次党代表大会通过的“支部工作纲要”，我提出几点意见：一、领导和组织机关工作人员
    学习是机关支部工作的首
    要任务
    中直各机关支部，近几年来已把领导和组织机关工作人员（党员和非党员）的文化、政治和理论学习当成首要的任务。在“支部工作纲要”上也这样规定了。
    “支部工作纲要”规定：机关中的党的支部工作，是政治工作和组织工作，不要把机关中的党的支部工作和机关的行政工作混淆起来。像我们中直这样的机关，工作人员都是国家工作人员，都属于工人阶级，为什么还需要政治工作呢？我们需要政治工作，一方面是为了保证行政任务的完成，另一方面是为了对机关工作人员进行教育。我们知道，机关工作人员虽说都属于工人阶级，但是由于他们来自社会各阶层，又经常受着各阶层的影响，事实上存在着思想不纯的现象。所以提高他们的阶级觉悟，并经过这样的教育来巩固机关党的组织，加强机关党组织的战斗力是十分必要的。这就是说，必须以工人阶级的思想、马克思列宁主义的思想，去克服工作人员头脑中的非工人阶级的、非马克思列宁主义的思想。因此，领导和组织机关工作人员的学习，是政治工作中的首要工作，也是整个支部工作中的首要任务。刘少奇同志教导我们说，要把组织和领导学习提到政治工作的高度。这个指示有极为深刻的意义，我们必须坚决加以执行。几年来的经验证明，凡是抓住领导学习这一环节的机关，其工作人员都有蓬勃的朝气，不论业务方面或思想方面都是进步很快的。二、加强统一的集中的活动是
    保证学好理论的关键
    “中直各机关党的支部应以尽可能统一地集中地进行党的活动为原则。”“支部工作纲要”上是这样规定了。在这次领导和组织学习“毛泽东选集”的工作中，我们就要按照这一规定去作。为什么要有这样的规定呢？刘少奇同志在“论党”中说：
    “党章规定：在一个工厂、矿山、农村、企业、街道、机关和学校中，不论党员有多少人，从三个党员起，到几千个党员止，都只成立一个统一的党的组织，成为党的基础组织，成为党在这个工厂、矿山、机关和学校等等群众中的战斗的堡垒。党的基础组织，一般称为党的支部，特殊地称为党的总支部或党的工厂、机关、学校委员会。在党的支部之内，将党员编入若干小组的办法，是应该采用的，对工作有些便利，有些作用，但不应该过分强调小组的作用，不应将许多工作分散在小组去进行，而应由支部统一地集中地去进行，只有由支部集中进行不方便的，才分散到小组去进行。”（“论党”一二八页。着重点是我加的——笔者）刘少奇同志这个报告是一九四五年在党的第七次全国代表大会上作的。由于我们的实际经验不足，在很长的一段时间内，我们有些机关支部没有对刘少奇同志的这一指示给予应有的注意。一九四八年冬季，刘少奇同志又在中直机关的一个总支大会上特别强调了这一点。当时我们实际上还是把党的小组误认为党的基础组织，因而把许多工作都推到小组去进行。有的机关因为把支部划得很小，那里的支部活动实际上等于小组活动。现在中直机关比过去更加扩大，更加集中，这个指示对于我们就更加重要了。这种落后的、分散的活动方式是不能再允许它继续存在了。现在我们已经基本上认识了刘少奇同志这一指示的重要性，所以在“支部工作纲要”上作了上述的明确的规定。
    坚决执行这一条规定，对于组织“毛泽东选集”的学习来说，是一个重要的关键。要组织数千干部在一年的时间内学完“毛泽东选集”这样一部科学巨著，不是一件简单的工作。我们的机关，已经集中在交通方便的北京城，如果还沿用过去在农村的方法，而不把中直机关当作“一个机关”看，不统一地进行学习，不将辅导的力量集中使用，仍由各部门各自为政、分散地进行学习，那是一定学不好的，至少有一部分机关学不好。所以由中直机关党委统一地规定学习步骤、学习方法，集中地进行辅导学习和解答问题是完全必要的。就一个部门来说，学习的领导又应该集中在总支委员会（或直属支部委员会），如果让分支部委员会（或小组长）去领导学习，也是领导不好的。比如某小组的组长是学文化的，那他怎么能领导他的组员学理论呢？一个较大的部门，应由总支委员会统一地布置学习，集中地请人讲授和解答问题；否则由各分支部委员会去布置学习，就一定会发生步骤不统一、学习不深入、了解不一致等毛病。
    这次中直机关党委规定，中直各机关都要在八月底以前学完“实践论”和“矛盾论”，好从九月一日起，全中直机关按照统一的计划齐头并进地学习。又决定在中直机关党委领导下成立学习辅导组，进行集体的辅导工作，在每一个学习阶段都要作启发报告并解答问题。这样，数千参加学习的同志在一个机关党委领导之下、在一个集体的辅导力量帮助之下，又是同时学习，互相启发，互相推动，就可能有比较良好的成绩。所以我认为，要使中直各机关都能按计划把“毛泽东选集”学好，就必须加强统一的集中的支部活动，加强党委对学习的统一的、集中的领导。三、总支委员会（或直属支部
    委员会）、分支部委员会
    和小组长应该做些什么
    关于学习“毛泽东选集”的总的计划、请人作启发报告、解答疑难问题等等，已经或者将要由中直机关党委统一地规定和进行。总支委员会、或直属支部委员会应该做些什么呢？我认为它们的任务，就是如何具体执行中直机关党委的学习计划：具体说来，约有下列几方面：
    （一）了解本机关工作人员的文化、政治和理论水平，动员他们参加学习，并且要努力学好；同时正确地编好班级。在进行学习动员和编级时，一方面要反对“好高鹜远”的思想，另一方面也要反对个别同志的明明可以参加而不敢参加高级组学习的思想。
    （二）了解学习情况、学习进度、学习成绩以及学习中发生的问题（如果成立了学习小组，可通过或协同学习小组长进行），组织及时的有效的辅导工作。组织和领导辅导员（或辅导员小组）的工作。
    机关学习辅导员的任务，照中直机关党委的规定是：“甲、传达党委辅导组关于进行学习的意见并指导本单位的学习；乙、帮助参加学习的同志解答问题。”设立和培养学习辅导员，对于我们中直各机关，还是一个崭新的工作；总支部或支部的委员会必须经常地帮助这些辅导员，和他们讨论工作方法，给他们以工作的便利，帮助他们总结经验等；不能把这一工作只交给教育委员一人去做。
    （三）通过分支部委员会或党的小组长对参加学习的同志进行考勤的工作，如是否按时认真学习了，是否作了笔记，在学习中有无思想偏向等等。
    按“支部工作纲要”规定，总支部下面的分支部也设有教育委员。这个教育委员的任务是要在中直机关党委和总支委员会规定的计划之下对各种学习负检查督促之责。但是，大家在学习中对于各种问题的了解程度，他不负主要的检查责任；这种责任主要的应由总支委员会来担负。只有这个分支部的住地离总支部太远时，那里的教育委员才负有更多的责任——不仅负责考勤，而且要负责帮助总支委员会检查大家在学习中对各种问题的了解程度。
    总支委员会或直属支部委员会为了统一地集中地领导和组织各种学习，教育委员的工作必须加强。有的机关设有文教科或教育科，这样的部门实际上应该成为教育委员的助手；有的机关的辅导员很多，就应该把他们组织起来，作为教育委员的有力助手；最好能把两个助手都使用起来，分工合作。这两个条件都没有的，可以采用下述的两种办法来加强教育委员的工作：或者是增加教育委员，或者是把几种教育分开，各设教育委员一人。有的机关把学习小组长和学习辅导员组织起来，在教育委员领导之下成立“干事会”，这种办法也能够加强教育委员的工作，因此也是可以采用的。
    机关党委、总支委员会（直属支部委员会）、分支部委员会、小组长在领导和组织理论学习中的这种分工，我认为是必要的。
