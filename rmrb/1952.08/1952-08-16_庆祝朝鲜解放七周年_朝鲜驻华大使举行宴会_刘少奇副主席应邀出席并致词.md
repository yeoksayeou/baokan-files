Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Kwon O-jik, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, held a banquet in Beijing on the evening of the 15th to celebrate the seventh anniversary of Korea's liberation on "August 15th."

Those invited to attend included: Liu Shaoqi and Li Jishen, Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government, Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the State Council, Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court, Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, heads of various departments of the Central People's Government, leaders of various democratic parties, and Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and over two hundred other people.

Du Ping, head of the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the "August 1st" Sports Meeting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and volunteer air force heroes Zhang Jihui, Zhao Baotong, and Liu Yudi were also invited to attend the banquet.

Diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from various countries stationed in China were also invited to attend.

Ambassador Kwon O-jik delivered a speech first. He said: Today is the seventh anniversary of the day when the great Soviet army liberated Korea from the barbaric rule of Japanese imperialism. The brilliant achievements made by the Korean people in the years after liberation are the result of the creative efforts of the Korean people who love their motherland and the selfless and enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet people. However, in order to turn Korea into its colony and use it as a base for attacking China and the Soviet Union, U.S. imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea. The American aggressors tried to conquer the Korean people by savage and tyrannical means, but this estimate was fundamentally wrong. During the two years of the Fatherland Liberation War against American aggression, the Korean people, both at the front and in the rear, were completely united, rallied around their beloved leader General Kim Il-sung, and exerted infinite strength for the victory of the motherland, achieving great victories.

Ambassador Kwon O-jik said: During the difficult period of the Korean People's Liberation War, the great Chinese brothers, recognizing that the Korean people's struggle was their own struggle, directly participated in the war to drive out the foreign aggressors, giving the enemy a heavy blow. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the heroic Chinese people, who have undergone long-term training and achieved brilliant victories in human history, are leading the Korean people's anti-aggression struggle to victory.

Ambassador Kwon O-jik concluded by saying: The Korean people's struggle to defend their motherland and defend peace is receiving warm support and solidarity from the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving camp around the world. Today, as the Korean people, who are in the midst of a difficult war environment, greet the "August 15th" Liberation Anniversary, they have a firmer determination and will win the final victory in their just cause.

Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi then delivered a speech, stating: On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the liberation of Korea, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the Korean people and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on behalf of the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China. Under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have achieved significant victories in their heroic struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and have made brilliant contributions to defending world peace. For the independence and liberation of Korea, and for the security of China, the Chinese people will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people and strive for the final victory over the U.S. imperialist aggressors. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi concluded by wishing the Korean people greater victories in the Liberation War and wishing the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people longevity.

The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

    庆祝朝鲜解放七周年
    朝鲜驻华大使举行宴会
    刘少奇副主席应邀出席并致词
    【新华社十五日讯】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使权五稷于十五日晚间在北京举行宴会，庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放七周年纪念。
    应邀出席的有：中央人民政府副主席刘少奇、李济深，政务院副总理郭沫若，最高人民法院院长沈钧儒，中国人民革命军事委员会代总参谋长聂荣臻，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席陈叔通，中央人民政府外交部副部长章汉夫，以及中央人民政府各部门首长、各民主党派负责人和北京市人民政府副市长吴晗等二百余人。
    前来北京参加中国人民解放军“八一”体育运动大会的中国人民志愿军代表团团长、中国人民志愿军政治部副主任杜平及志愿军空军英雄张积慧、赵宝桐、刘玉堤等亦应邀出席了宴会。
    应邀出席的还有各国驻华使节和使馆人员。
    权五稷大使首先致辞。他说：今天是伟大的苏联军队把朝鲜从日本帝国主义的野蛮统治下解放出来的七周年纪念日。朝鲜人民在解放后的数年中，所获得的辉煌成就是热爱自己祖国的朝鲜人民的创造的努力和苏联人民的大公无私的热诚援助的结果。但是，美帝国主义为了想把朝鲜变为它的殖民地，并想把它作为进攻中国和苏联的基地，发动了侵略朝鲜的战争。美国侵略者曾想用野蛮横暴的手段征服朝鲜人民，但是，这种估计是根本错误了。朝鲜人民在反对美国侵略的祖国解放战争的两年中，前线和后方完全一致，团结在自己敬爱的领袖金日成将军的周围，为了祖国的胜利发挥了无穷尽的力量，取得了伟大的胜利。
    权五稷大使说：在朝鲜人民解放战争的艰苦时期，伟大的中国弟兄们，认识到朝鲜人民的斗争就是自己的斗争，直接参加了赶走外来侵略势力的战争，给敌人以沉重的打击。在伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，经过长期的锻炼并获得了人类史上辉煌胜利的英雄的中国人民，把朝鲜人民的反侵略斗争引向胜利。
    权五稷大使最后说：朝鲜人民的为了保卫祖国、保卫和平的斗争，是受着以苏联为首的各人民民主国家和全世界爱好和平阵营的热烈支持与声援的。今天在艰苦的战争环境中迎接“八·一五”解放纪念日的朝鲜人民，有着更坚定的决心，将在自己的正义事业中赢得最后的胜利。
    刘少奇副主席继起致辞称：欣逢朝鲜解放七周年纪念日，我谨代表中国人民、中华人民共和国政府，向朝鲜人民及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府致热烈的祝贺。朝鲜人民在金日成将军领导下，在反对美帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争中，业已取得重大的胜利，并对保卫世界和平作了辉煌的贡献。为了朝鲜的独立解放，为了中国的安全，中国人民将永远坚定地和朝鲜人民并肩前进，为最后战胜美帝国主义侵略者而奋斗。刘少奇副主席最后祝朝鲜人民在解放战争中获得更大的胜利，并祝中朝人民牢不可破的友谊万岁。
    宴会在热烈友好的气氛中进行。
