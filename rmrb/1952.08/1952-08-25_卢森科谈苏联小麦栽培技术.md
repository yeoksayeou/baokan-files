Lysenko Discusses Soviet Wheat Cultivation Techniques

Editor's Note: This is a report given by Soviet agronomist Lysenko on August 4, 1952, at the Shuangqiao Mechanized Farming School near Beijing. The principles of wheat cultivation techniques he discusses are the result of years of practice and research by Soviet agricultural scientists, farm workers, and collective farm members. While the specific examples may not be entirely applicable to all regions of our country, the direction he points out is entirely correct. Principles such as grass-arable rotation and narrow-row close planting have been effective in many farms and among farmers in our country. Our agriculture is currently not able to implement large-scale mechanization, but as long as we pay attention to improving cultivation techniques, yields can still be greatly increased. According to Lysenko's estimates, under the same current conditions, even without increasing any other investment, simply by improving sowing methods, especially by universally promoting uniform and close planting, our country could increase wheat production by several million tons a year. Our agricultural leading bodies and agricultural science and technology personnel should, based on the principles discussed by Lysenko, combined with the abundant harvest experiences and specific conditions of various regions, strive to experiment and research, and continuously advance our country's wheat cultivation techniques.

Cultivation technology is the use of human power to create the most favorable conditions for crops to achieve high yields. Wheat, like other crops, has certain requirements for external conditions for growth and development. How to create conditions to meet its needs is what cultivation technology needs to solve. However, increasing production cannot be approached in isolation from a single technique, but rather the entire set of techniques should be studied. Because each technique is interconnected, we call it a comprehensive cultivation technique. The timing of the implementation of each item of the entire set of comprehensive techniques varies, and we can discuss them separately:

I. Tillage Work

For wheat to obtain high yields, it must first have neat and strong seedlings. To achieve this, the land must be prepared with intensive cultivation. Tillage is the main measure to maintain soil moisture and fertility to ensure the growth of neat and strong seedlings. (In areas where soil moisture is lacking, tillage is even more important.) In the Soviet Union, the first step in tillage is to remove stubble, and then use a compound plow (a plow with a small foreplow) for plowing. The plowing depth has strict regulations, and it must not be less than twenty centimeters at the shallowest.

Correct grass-arable rotation is also an item of intensive cultivation work, and it is also a major way to maintain soil moisture and increase soil fertility. The experience gained by the famous Soviet soil scientist Williams in twenty years of experimental research fully proves that only by using the correct grass-arable rotation system can stable and high yields be obtained. On the same area of land, under the intensive cultivation system, planting rye for twenty years resulted in an average yield of 906.8 jin per mu per year; in twenty years, the highest yield per mu was 933.4 jin, and the lowest was 826.8 jin. Williams determined the grass-arable rotation system based on his experiments and widely promoted this farming system.

In order to maintain soil moisture and fertility, weeds must never be allowed to grow on fallow land; the soil must be loosened after rain to prevent the soil surface from forming a hard crust. However, do not plow countless times, but rather adapt to the specific requirements of the soil, using a tine harrow to harrow the land or using a cultivator for cultivation. This can not only remove weeds but also loosen the soil to allow air to circulate. The depth of the last cultivation before sowing wheat should not exceed the depth of wheat sowing (five to six centimeters).

In China, it is relatively rare to sow wheat on summer fallow land, and most land is planted with wheat immediately after harvesting autumn crops. Therefore, it is very important to carry out appropriate cultivation on the previous crop land in order to create favorable conditions for wheat growth. In the Soviet Union, there is a certain system for cultivation, that is, cultivation must be from deep to shallow, and the depth of the last cultivation must not exceed the depth of wheat sowing. If the previous crop is corn, the initial cultivation depth is twelve centimeters, and the final cultivation depth should not exceed five to six centimeters. The number of cultivations should be determined according to the specific situation; too many will excessively damage the soil structure.

If the previous crop is not a cultivated crop, the field must also be kept free of weeds at all times; after the crop is harvested, plowing must be carried out at the latest fifteen to twenty days before sowing wheat. After the soil is plowed, it is very loose and will sink downward within a certain period of time, so it should be plowed early. If sowing is done immediately after plowing, the soil will sink just when the wheat is sprouting and taking root, which will damage the wheat seedlings' roots, causing a large number of seedlings to die during the winter, thereby reducing yield. The reason why the depth of the last cultivation before sowing wheat should not exceed the depth of wheat sowing is also the same.

The specific tillage system should be determined according to the soil, climate, and other conditions of various regions; however, the above-mentioned principles are generally feasible. Judging from the farming situation of Chinese farmers, many places violate the above-mentioned principles. For example, in Tongxian County in 1949-1950, the land was plowed only when sowing was imminent, and it was plowed very deep (compared to the depth of wheat sowing). In some areas of the south, after harvesting rice, the land is not prepared, and wheat is sown directly into furrows made by a plow knife without covering the soil, which cannot maintain soil moisture and fertility and is detrimental to wheat growth. In some areas of the north, some farmers use a heavy iron plate behind the sowing drill to cover the soil, which causes great damage to the soil structure; this kind of farming tool and farming method needs to be improved. Under such a farming system, the yield is naturally very low, and occasional high yields cannot be stabilized. How to achieve high yields and stabilize them is the responsibility of agricultural scientific workers.

II. Sowing Amount and Sowing Method

Based on scientific research and long-term production practice, the Soviet Union has accumulated a lot of experience in sowing amount, and based on this experience, it has determined the sowing amount standards for various regions:

The sowing amounts on this table have become the legal sowing amounts in the Soviet Union. The sowing amount in each region is mainly determined according to the amount of rainfall. The smallest numbers in the table are the sowing amounts for areas with low rainfall (about 300 mm of rainfall per year). The largest numbers are the sowing amounts for areas with high rainfall (about 750 mm of rainfall per year). Stakhanov workers use even higher sowing amounts, 7 million grains per hectare (equivalent to 467,000 grains per mu in China); this is because they can better coordinate various production factors and master a high degree of production technology. Therefore, they can also obtain higher yields.

Because wheat grain weights are different, in order to ensure that there are enough seeds in a certain area, the amount of seeds used should be calculated in terms of the number of grains when specifying the amount of seeds used. The provisions in the above table are only general standards. There should still be differences in each small area or collective farm. They can use this legal amount as a basis, adapt to local conditions, and stipulate the local and their own farm's sowing amount. If it is fallow land and the tillage work is done well, the sowing amount can be reduced by 10%; conversely, if it is not fallow land, the tillage work is poor, and the soil moisture is insufficient, the amount of seeds needs to be increased by 5% to 10%. This is because, even though the seeds used are the best grains and have a high germination rate, 10% to 15% will still be lost due to underground pests and other reasons. If the tillage and other work are done well, the possibility of seed and seedling loss is small, so a little less than the above standard can be sown. Conversely, it is necessary to sow more than the standard to ensure that there are enough wheat seedlings per mu. The sowing amount should also be different depending on the variety and the time of sowing. If the sowing is not timely, the tillering rate is small, so it should be sown more than the prescribed standard. In short, the principle of the legal sowing amount can be appropriately and flexibly applied within a certain limit according to different specific conditions. For example, the Lenin Collective Farm stipulates that the sowing amount is 5 million grains per hectare, equivalent to 1.4 quintals; equivalent to 19 jin per Chinese mu. The land is cultivated using grass-arable rotation, and the row spacing is 15 centimeters. In 1950, on 653 hectares of land, the average yield was 25 quintals per hectare, equivalent to 333.3 jin per mu in China; in the same year, wheat was sown on another 77 hectares of land, using 10% less sowing amount than the former, and the average yield was 53 quintals per hectare, equivalent to 706 jin per mu in China. The sowing amount of the latter was less, but the yield per unit area was twice that of the former, just because the specific conditions of the two were different: the latter was fallow land, and the former was continuous cropping land. This example also shows that it is very beneficial to implement a correct rotation system and sow wheat using fallow land.

The following is a Soviet experiment on the relationship between wheat sowing density and yield:

The above table is the result of a three-year experiment. We can clearly see that the more sowing amount, the higher the general harvest amount. At the same time, it can also be seen that the yield of the first crop planted after fallow is much higher than the second, while the sowing amount can be relatively reduced.

What row spacing is appropriate? In the past, the Soviet Union generally adopted the narrow-row sowing method with a row spacing of 15 centimeters. In recent years, practical experience has proved that a row spacing of 15 centimeters is still too wide, so it has been reduced to 7.5 centimeters. The previous sowing machines were all suitable for a row spacing of 15 centimeters; now, in order to meet the new needs, farm implement factories are mass-producing sowing machines with a row spacing of 7.5 centimeters.

The yield per unit area of land sown with wide rows is low. Soviet experimental research institutions use wider row spacing when breeding new varieties in order to enable a small number of seeds to produce more seeds and accelerate the speed of new seed propagation. In production, seeds are not lacking, and narrow-row sowing is generally adopted. Because narrow-row sowing can make the seeds spread evenly, make full use of soil fertility, and allow plants to develop evenly; avoid direct sunlight on the ground to reduce soil moisture evaporation; at the same time, because wheat plants are luxuriant and there is less idle land, it can also inhibit weed growth. Using the same amount of seeds for wide-row sowing, because the seeds are squeezed into a line, many plants will be squeezed to death; the gaps between the rows are larger, which cannot make full use of soil fertility, resulting in waste, and creates favorable growth conditions for weeds.

In the Soviet Union, in addition to narrow-row sowing, cross-sowing is also used, that is, sowing once vertically and horizontally on a piece of land. The sowing amount per mu is the same as for narrow-row sowing. Because it requires two operations, the consumption of machine fuel is more, and the sowing cost is higher. However, this can spread the seeds more evenly, allow the plants to grow better, and the yield can be greater, and the extra wheat harvested can make up for the consumption during sowing and have a surplus.

Regarding the influence of row spacing and sowing density on the tillering of crops, the following table can be used to illustrate:

[Note] "Sowing with 15 cm and 45 cm spacing alternately" means that the spacing between the first and second rows is 15 cm wide, the spacing between the third and second rows is 45 cm wide, the spacing between the third and fourth rows is again 15 cm wide, and so on. "Effective tillering" refers to tillers that can grow ears of wheat.

From this table, it can be seen that the tillering of wider row spacing is a little more; however, the number of plants per square meter of wider row spacing is much less, and the yield per unit area is still not as high as that of narrow row spacing.

III. Sowing Depth

Sowing depth has a great relationship with crop growth and yield. Especially for wheat crops, only at a suitable depth can roots be well formed and tillers grow well. The following table is an experimental result of the relationship between sowing depth and plant development of winter wheat in the Soviet Union:

It can be seen from the above table that the influence of sowing depth on the number of tillers is not very great, but there are significant differences in the overwintering mortality rate. Undoubtedly, inappropriate sowing depth will cause a large number of wheat seedlings to die, thereby reducing yield. In the Soviet Union, it is generally stipulated that a depth of five to six centimeters is the best.

IV. Sowing Time

Whether the sowing time is appropriate or not is also one of the important factors affecting yield. Because each crop has a certain growth period; if it cannot reach the growth date it needs, it will reduce production. Especially for winter wheat, it needs to complete its tillering development before overwintering. If the sowing time is delayed and it cannot complete its tillering development before overwintering, then it will delay its tillering period to next spring; in this way, it undoubtedly delays and shortens its development period, so it cannot make it ear well, and it will inevitably reduce production. The following is an experimental result of the influence of winter wheat sowing date on yield at the Barnauri Breeding Station in Siberia, Soviet Union (this place has a cold climate and originally did not grow winter wheat): It can be seen from the table that the sowing date has a great influence on yield. (The yield in 1946 in the table was particularly low because the local area was particularly dry that year.) After long-term experimental research, the Soviet Union has stipulated the sowing dates for various regions; this date has become legal. In China, the sowing dates in various regions vary greatly, and the sowing period in the same region is very long, which is not good. Because the sowing date has a great impact on yield, even if all aspects of conditions are well coordinated, simply delaying the sowing date will also reduce yield. Therefore, I hope that agricultural scientific workers will conduct investigations and research in various regions of China, combine the soil, climate, and technical conditions of various regions, and stipulate the sowing dates in detail for each region. This is of great significance.

V. Seed Issues

"It is difficult to fatten a thin mother." Without good seeds, good crops cannot be grown. When sowing, it is necessary to strictly select pure and high-quality seeds; otherwise, even if other conditions are well coordinated, it is difficult to achieve high yields. Last year, when I went to the Bohai region, I saw that the farms did not pay attention to this work either. Their seeds were mixed with a lot of impurities. The seeds of the old folks looked clean on the surface, but upon careful inspection, at least 10% of impurities were mixed in. If the impurity rate of seeds is reduced to the minimum, and other technologies are coordinated, the yield can be increased by 10% to 15%. In the Soviet Union, there are strict legal regulations on the purity and germination rate of seeds. If these regulations are violated, the responsible agricultural technicians will be subject to certain penalties. If major losses are caused in production due to violations of the regulations, strict legal sanctions will also be imposed. Collective farms must also sow in accordance with the legally prescribed seed quality, and if it does not meet the regulations, it will also be punished. But so far, no one has been punished, because no one has violated the legal regulations.

In China, there are currently no such legal regulations; however, I think we should study them in detail and formulate a system. The establishment of a system is not to punish anyone, but to hope that everyone will pay attention to this issue.

Because seeds are of great significance in agricultural production, the Soviet Union has strict regulations on seed propagation. Seed propagation stations are set up in various places, and farms and agricultural cooperatives also reserve seed areas. The former is specially for supplying farms and agricultural cooperatives with the good varieties they need, and the latter is for farms and agricultural cooperatives to collect seeds themselves. China should also establish such a system for propagating good varieties.

VI. Field Management

The content of field management work includes overwintering protection, snow accumulation, topdressing, irrigation, spring harrowing, etc.; spring harrowing is especially important.

Spring harrowing of winter wheat has become a legal and compulsory work in the Soviet Union. Because the wheat fields have undergone rain and snow in the autumn and winter, the ground has formed a hard crust, and there are many remaining dead grasses and fallen leaves, which is a great obstacle to the activities of soil microorganisms. Therefore, it is necessary to use a harrow to loosen the soil, allow air to circulate, and create a favorable environment for soil microorganisms. Some wheat seedlings will be damaged during harrowing, but the new emergence rate after harrowing far exceeds the harrowing damage rate. The following table is an experimental result of spring harrowing in Omsk, Siberia, Soviet Union:

[Note] The dates in the table are all in May. Because the local climate is very cold and thaws late, the spring harrowing time is at the end of April.

It can be seen from the above table that not harrowing certainly does not cause any damage to the wheat seedlings, but its new emergence rate is also very small. After artificial harrowing, although there is some slight damage to the wheat seedlings, the new emergence rate has obviously increased. The damage rate after harrowing with a tractor tine harrow is the largest, but its new emergence rate is even greater. Therefore, we must vigorously promote the spring harrowing of wheat.

The time for spring harrowing of wheat is, in principle, as early as possible. As soon as the spring thaw begins, as long as horses or tractors can go to the field to work, they should start immediately. If you wait until the ground has formed a hard crust after thawing, it will be too late. If the spring harrowing work can be carried out correctly, the yield can be increased by 10%.

The application of fertilizer must be appropriate. Applying too much fertilizer and lacking fertilizer are equally harmful. The amount of topdressing applied to wheat should be determined with reference to the amount of base fertilizer, and should be applied as early as possible during the early spring snowmelt, and not later than after thawing. Spring harrowing should be carried out immediately after fertilization. If two topdressings are applied, the second one should be applied when the wheat is bolting.

Snow accumulation in the field is also very important. Snow accumulation is to increase soil moisture. In areas with heavy snowfall in winter, the significance of this work is very great. The method of snow accumulation is generally to use straw stalks as barriers to prevent snowflakes from blowing out of the field; or use the straw stalks of the previous crop, leaving a row unpulled at appropriate intervals as a barrier to block snow.

Irrigation also has a great impact on wheat growth. The following is an experimental result of the impact of irrigation on the root development of winter wheat in the Soviet Union:

It can be clearly seen from the above table that irrigation has a great impact on wheat growth. Wheat seedlings that have been irrigated and topdressed have about 60% more tillering roots than those that have not been irrigated, and the yield is more than doubled. Experiments have proved that wheat needs irrigation most during the bolting and flowering stages. Of course, irrigation before sowing is also very important; this can ensure that wheat seedlings have enough moisture during the seedling stage, so that the seedlings grow and develop neatly and strongly. As for the amount of irrigation and irrigation methods, they should be determined according to soil conditions and specific conditions.

The above are several important tasks in field management. These tasks must be carried out correctly in order to obtain high yields. The famous Soviet agronomist Timiryazev once said: "To obtain high yields, we must ask the plants what they need, and we will supply them with what they need."

VII. Harvest

Everyone knows that crops are cultivated for harvest. However, many people still do not pay enough attention to the harvest work. Due to improper harvesting, the fruits of labor are often subject to unnecessary losses. The suitable harvesting period for wheat is generally in the "wax ripening stage," that is, the stage when the wheat grains are broken with a fingernail and no milky juice is found. If artificial harvesting is used, it should be done earlier. Because artificial harvesting is very slow, if you do not start harvesting earlier, the ones harvested in the later stages will inevitably lose grains due to excessive maturity; at the same time, because the wheat plants still have after-ripening effect after artificial harvesting (the nutrients in the wheat leaves and stems continue to be transported to the ears of wheat), harvesting earlier will not affect the yield. Harvesting with a combine harvester, which cuts and threshes immediately, can and should be done later than artificial harvesting.

× × ×

The above discussion is only about the general principles of wheat cultivation technology; the examples cited are only experimental materials from local areas in the Soviet Union. Therefore, if it is mechanically applied to various parts of China in its entirety, it may not be appropriate. However, I am pointing out a direction, and this direction has been proven correct by years of experimental research in the Soviet Union. I hope that everyone will study it in detail according to the specific conditions of various regions of China, formulate a plan applicable to China, and apply it specifically in practice. As long as everyone does this, I believe that it will play a great role in production in a few years.

### 卢森科谈苏联小麦栽培技术

第2版()
专栏：

    卢森科谈苏联小麦栽培技术
    编者按：这是苏联农学专家卢森科一九五二年八月四日在京郊双桥机耕学校的报告。他所谈的小麦栽培技术的原则，是苏联农业科学工作者和农场工人、农庄庄员多年实践、研究的成果。其中具体的事例在我国各地不一定完全适用，但他所指出的方向是完全正确的。其中草田轮作、窄行密植等原则，在我国已有不少农场和农民行之有效。我国农业目前还不可能实行大规模的机械化，但只要注意改进栽培技术，产量还是可以大大增加的。据卢森科估计，在目前同样的条件下，即使不增加别的任何投资，只要改善了播种方法，特别是普遍推广了均匀密植的办法，我国一年就可以增产数百万吨小麦。我国的农业领导机关和农业科学技术工作人员应当根据卢森科所谈的原则，结合各地的丰产经验和具体条件，努力试验研究，把我国的小麦栽培技术不断向前推进。
    栽培技术，就是用人力来给农作物创造最有利的条件，使它达到高额产量。小麦也和其他作物一样，它对生长发育的外界条件也有一定要求。如何创造条件来满足它的需要，这便是栽培技术所要解决的问题。不过，提高产量不能孤立地单从某一项技术着手，而应研究整套的技术。因为每一项技术都是相互关联的，所以我们把它叫做综合性的栽培技术。实施整套综合技术的各个项目的时间有先后，这里可以分开来讲：
    一、整地工作
    小麦要能获得高额产量，首先要有整齐健壮的幼苗。要做到这样，就要用精耕的办法修整土地。整地是保持土壤水分和肥力以保证幼苗生长整齐健壮的主要措施。（在土壤水分缺少的地区，整地工作更为重要。）苏联在耕地之前首先灭茬，然后再用复式犁（带有小前犁的犁）进行翻耕。耕翻深度有严格的规定，最浅不能少于二十公分。
    正确的草田轮作，也是精耕工作的一项，它也是保持土壤水分和增加土壤肥力的一个主要方式。苏联著名土壤学家威廉斯在二十年的试验研究工作中得到的经验，充分地证明：只有利用正确的草田轮作制，才能获得稳定而高额的产量。他在同样面积上，在精耕制度下，种植黑麦二十年，每年每亩平均产量是九○六点八斤；二十年中每亩最高产量是九三三点四斤，最低是八二六点八斤。威廉斯根据他的实验确定了草田轮作制，并广泛地推行了这种耕作制度。
    为了保持土壤的水分和肥力，在休闲地上，绝对不能让杂草滋生；雨后必须松土，不使土壤表面结成硬壳。但不能无数次地耕翻，而要适合土壤的具体要求，使用钉齿耙耙地或利用中耕器中耕。这样既可除草，又可疏松土壤使空气流通。小麦播种前最后一次中耕的深度不应超过小麦播种的深度（五至六公分）。
    在中国，用夏季休闲地播种小麦的比较少，大部分土地是收了秋之后接着种麦。因此，在前作地上进行适当的中耕以便为小麦生长创造有利条件，是一个很重要的问题。在苏联，中耕是有一定制度的，就是中耕必须由深而浅，最后一次深度不得超过小麦播种深度。如前作是玉米，初次中耕深度是十二公分，最后一次中耕深度不能超过五至六公分。中耕次数要根据具体情况决定，过多了会使土壤结构遭到过分的破坏。
    如果前作物不是中耕作物，也要保持田间经常没有杂草；作物收获后，最晚要在小麦播种前十五天到二十天进行翻耕。土壤经过翻耕后很松软，在一定时间内要向下沉实，因此要早耕。如果在耕地后立即播种，恰好在小麦出芽生根的时候土壤下沉，就会损伤小麦幼根，使麦苗在越冬期间大量死亡，因而减低产量。种麦前最后一次中耕深度不得超过小麦播种深度，也是这个道理。
    具体的整地制度，要根据各地的土壤、气候等条件决定；但上面说的原则是一般可行的。就中国农民的耕作情况看，许多地方违反了以上所谈的原则。如一九四九年—一九五○年在通县所看到的，都是临播种时才耕地，而且耕得很深（和小麦播种深度比较）。南方有些地区在水稻收割后不整地，马上用犁刀耠沟播下麦子，又不盖土，这样就不能保持土壤水分和肥力，对小麦的生长也是不利的。在北方有些农民在播种的耧后用一块很重的铁板盖土，这对土壤结构起了很大的破坏作用；这种农具和耕作方法需要加以改善。在这样的耕作制度下，产量自然是很低的，偶有高额产量也是不能稳定的。如何达到丰产和稳定它，这就是农业科学工作者的责任了。
    二、播种量和播种方法
    根据科学的研究试验和长期的生产实践，苏联在播种量上积累了不少经验，并根据这些经验确定了各个不同地区的播种量标准：
    这个表上的播种量，在苏联已成为法定的播种量。各地区的播种量主要是根据降雨量规定的。上表数字最少的，是降雨少的地区（每年降雨量约三○○公厘）的播种量。数字最多的是降雨量多的地区（每年降雨量约七五○公厘）的播种量。斯达哈诺夫工作者采用的播种量更高，每公顷七百万粒（合中国每亩四十六万七千粒）；这是因为他们能更好地配合各个生产因素，掌握了高度的生产技术。因此，他们也就能获得更高的产量。
    小麦的粒重不同，因此，为了保证在一定面积内有足够的种子量，在规定种籽用量时应该用粒数计算。以上这个表的规定还只是一般的标准。在每一个小地区或集体农庄，仍要有所不同。他们可以依据这个法定量做基础，适应当地情况，规定当地的和本农庄的播种量。如果是休闲地而且整地工作做得很好，可减少百分之十的播种量；反之，既不是休闲地，整地工作又差，土壤水分不足，就需要增加百分之五到百分之十的种子。这是因为，种籽虽是用最好的籽粒和有高度发芽率的；但因地下害虫及其他原因，也要损失百分之十到十五。整地等工作做得好的，种籽和幼苗损失的可能小，这就可以比上述标准少播一些。反之，就要比标准多播一些，才能保证每亩地上有足够的麦苗。品种不同，播种早晚不同，播种量也应有所不同。播种不适时的分蘖率小，就应比规定的标准多播一些。总之，法定播种量的原则在一定限度之内是可以根据具体条件的不同，适当灵活地应用的。如列宁集体农庄规定每公顷播种量是五百万粒，合一点四公担；每市亩合十九斤。土地是施行草田轮作的，行距是十五公分。一九五○年在六百五十三公顷土地上，平均每公顷产麦二十五公担，合中国每亩三三三点三斤；同年在另一块七十七公顷地上播种小麦，播种量比前者少用百分之十，平均每公顷收了五十三公担，合中国每亩七○六斤。后者播种量少而单位面积产量比前者大一倍，就因为两者的具体条件不同：后者是休闲地，前者是连作地。这个例子也可说明实行正确的轮作制，用休闲地播种小麦，是有很大好处的。
    下面是苏联小麦播种密度和产量的关系的一个试验结果：
    上表是经过三年实验的结果。我们可以很明显地看出，播种量较多的，一般的收获量都较高。同时也可以看出，经过休闲后第一次种的作物，产量比第二次要高得多，而播种量反可相对地减少。
    播种行距怎样才算适当？苏联过去一般都采用行距十五公分的窄行播种法。最近几年根据实践的经验证明，十五公分的行距还是太宽，于是又缩小到七点五公分。以前的播种机都是适合十五公分行距用的；现在为了适应新的需要，农具厂正大量制造七点五公分行距的播种机。
    宽行播种的田地的单位面积产量是低的。苏联试验研究机关在繁殖新品种时，为了使少数种籽能产生较多的种籽，加快新种的繁殖速度，才采用较宽的行距播种。在生产中，种籽不缺乏，一般都采用窄行播种。因为窄行播种可使种籽撒布均匀，充分利用地力，植株可以平均发育；避免阳光直射地面，以减少土壤水分的蒸发；同时，因小麦植株繁茂，空闲地少了，又可抑制杂草生长。用同样多的种籽实行宽行播种，则因种子挤在一条线上，有很多植株要被挤死；行间空隙较大，不能充分利用地力，形成浪费，并为杂草创造了有利的生长条件。
    在苏联，除窄行播种外，还采用交叉播种的办法，就是在一块地上纵横播种各一次。每亩的播种量和窄行播种是一样的。因为进行两次作业，机器油料消耗较多，播种费用要大一些。但这样能把种子播布得更均匀，使植株长得更好，产量可以更大，多收的麦子可以弥补播种时的消耗而有余。
    关于行距和播种密度对作物的分蘖的影响，可用下表说明：
    〔注〕“十五公分和四十五公分相间播种”是指第一、二行间是十五公分宽，第三行和第二行间是四十五公分宽，第三、四行间又是十五公分宽，依此类推。“有效分蘖”是指能长麦穗的分蘖。
    从这个表看，行距较宽的分蘖较多一些；但行距宽的每平方公尺的株数少得多，单位面积产量仍没有行距窄的地高。
    三、播种深度
    播种深度对作物的生长和产量有很大关系。尤其是麦类作物，只有在适宜的深度下才能很好地形成根系，长好分蘖。下表是苏联冬小麦播种深度和植株发育关系的一个试验结果：
    从上表可以看出，播种深度对分蘖数目的影响还不很大，而在越冬死亡率上却有显著的差异。无疑的，播种深度的不恰当，会使麦苗大量死亡，因而减低产量。在苏联一般规定以五至六公分深为最好。
    四、播种时期
    播种的时期恰当不恰当，也是影响产量的重要因素之一。因为每种作物都有它一定的生育期限；如果不能达到它所需要的生育日期，就会减产。特别是冬小麦，它需要在越冬以前完成它的分蘖发育。如果把播种时间耽误了，不能在越冬以前完成它的分蘖发育，那它就把分蘖期延到明春；这样，无疑地延迟和缩短了它的发育期，因而不能使它很好地抽穗，必然减低了产量。下面是苏联西伯利亚巴尔尼乌里育种站冬小麦播种期对产量影响的试验结果（这个地方气候冷，原来不种冬小麦）：从表内可以看出，播种期对于产量有很大影响。（表内一九四六年的产量特别低，是因为这一年当地特别受旱的缘故。）苏联经过了长期的试验研究，规定了各地区播种的日期；这个日期已经成为法定的了。在中国各个地区的播种期相差很大，在同一地区内播种期拖得很长，这是不好的。因为播种期对产量的影响很大，即使各方面条件都配合得好，只是播种期晚了，也同样会减低产量。所以我希望农业科学工作者，在中国各个地区进行调查研究，结合各地土壤、气候和技术条件，把各地的播种日期详细规定出来。这是有很大意义的。
    五、种籽问题
    “母瘦子难肥”。没有优良的种子，是长不出好庄稼的。在播种时必须严格地选用纯净而优良的种籽；否则，尽管其他条件配合得很好，也很难达到高额产量。去年我到渤海区，看到农场对这一工作也没有重视。他们的种籽里面夹杂着很多杂物。老乡们的种籽从表面上看好像还干净，仔细检查起来，至少有百分之十的杂质夹在里面。如果把种籽的夹杂率降到最低度，再配合其他技术，可以提高产量百分之十至十五。在苏联，对于种籽的纯度、发芽率是有严格的法律规定的。如果违反了这些规定，负责的农业技术人员要受到一定的处分。如因违反了规定在生产上引起了重大损失时，还要受到严格的法律制裁。集体农庄也要按照法定的种籽质量进行播种，如果不符合规定，也要受罚。但至今还没有受罚的，因为没有人违反法律的规定。
    在中国目前还没有这样的法律规定；但是我想应该详细研究，订出一个制度来。订立制度不是为了处罚谁，而是希望大家对这个问题重视起来。
    正因为种籽在农业生产上有着重大意义，所以在苏联对于种籽的繁殖也有严格的制度规定。各地都设有种籽繁殖站，各农场和农庄自己也留有种籽区。前者是专门供给农庄和农场需要的优良品种的，后者是农场、农庄自己采种用的。在中国也应该建立起这种繁殖良种的制度。
    六、田间管理
    田间管理工作的内容，包括越冬保护、积雪、施追肥、灌溉、春耙等；春耙工作尤其重要。
    冬小麦的春耙工作，在苏联已经成为法定的必行工作。因为麦地经过秋季冬季的雨雪，地面结成了硬壳，而且残存着许多枯草落叶，这样对土壤微生物的活动是极大的障碍。所以必须利用耙来疏松土壤，使空气流通，为土壤微生物创造有利的环境。在耙地时会损伤一些麦苗，但是耙过以后的新生率是远远超过耙地损伤率的。下表是苏联西伯利亚鄂木斯克地方的一个春耙试验结果：
    〔注〕表中的日期都在五月。因当地气候很冷，解冻晚，所以春耙时间在四月末。
    从上表可以看出，不耙对麦苗当然没有什么损伤，但它的新生率也就很少。经过人工耙地后，麦苗虽然有一些轻微的损伤，但新生率显然增多了。用拖拉机钉齿耙耙后的损伤率最大，但它的新生率是更大的。所以我们必须大力提倡小麦的春耙工作。
    小麦春耙工作的时间，原则上是越早越好。春季刚解冻时，只要马或拖拉机能够下地工作，就应立即开始。若等到化冻后地面已结成了硬壳时再耙，就晚了。如能正确地执行春耙工作，就可以提高百分之十的产量。
    施用肥料必须适当。施肥过多和缺肥是同样有害的。小麦施用追肥的数量，应参照基肥的数量来决定，并应及早在早春化雪时施下，不要迟至解冻以后。施肥后应即行春耙。如果施用两次追肥，第二次应在小麦抽秆时施下。
    田间积雪工作也很重要。积雪是为了增加土壤水分。在冬季多雪的地区，这个工作的意义很大。积雪的方法，一般是以藁秆作障，阻挡雪花不使吹飘田外；或利用前作物藁秆，每隔适当距离内留一行不拔去，作为挡雪的屏障。
    灌溉对小麦生育也有很大影响。下面是苏联关于灌溉对冬小麦根系发育的影响的一个试验结果：
    从上表可以明显地看出，灌溉对小麦生育的影响很大。经过灌溉并施用追肥的麦苗，比不灌溉的麦苗的分蘖根增加了百分之六十左右，产量提高两倍以上。经过实验证明，小麦在抽秆及开花期最需要灌溉。当然，在播种前灌溉也非常重要；这可以保证小麦幼苗期有足够的水分，使幼苗生长发育整齐健壮。至于灌溉量和灌溉方法，应根据土壤情况和具体条件来决定。
    以上谈的，是田间管理中的几项重要工作。必须正确地执行这些工作，才能得到丰产。苏联著名农学家季米里亚捷夫曾经说：“要想获得丰产，就必须向植物询问，看它需要什么，我们就供给它什么。”
    七、收获
    谁都知道，栽培作物是为了收获。但是很多人对于收获工作还是不够重视的。由于收获不当，劳动的果实常常受到不必要的损失。小麦适宜的收割期一般是在“腊熟期”，即用指甲掏破麦粒而没有发现乳浆的时期。如果是用人工收割，就应当早些。因为人工收割很慢，如果不早些开始收割，到后期收割的就不免因过分成熟而落粒；同时，由于人工收割后麦棵还有后熟作用（割下后麦叶麦秆中的养分向麦穗继续输送），所以早些收割不会影响产量。用康拜因机收割，割了马上就要脱粒，就可以而且应当比人工收割的时间晚一些。

    以上所谈的只是小麦栽培技术问题的一般原则；所举的例子只是苏联局部地方的试验材料。因此，如果把它全盘机械地搬到中国各地应用，也许有些不恰当。不过，我是指出一个方向，这方向在苏联经过多年实验研究已经证明是正确的。我希望大家根据中国各地具体情况，详细加以研究，订出适用于中国的方案来，并在实践中具体地应用。只要大家这样做，我相信几年以后在生产上是会起很大作用的。
