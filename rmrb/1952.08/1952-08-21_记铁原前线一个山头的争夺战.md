    The battle for an unnamed height west of Tieyuan is a typical battle in the mountain warfare on the Korean front in recent months. From June 8th to August 3rd, for fifty-seven days, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies fought repeatedly with the American invading army on this small height, annihilating approximately two thousand American soldiers with flexible tactics and at a very small cost.

    This height is a narrow and long hill, over 200 meters high, 300 meters long from north to south, and only ten meters wide at the top, located between the enemy and our front lines. Our army's position was to its west, and the enemy's to the east. Since the beginning of June, repeated battles have been constantly occurring on this hill.

    On June 7th, a company of the American invading army's 45th Division secretly occupied this hill, attempting to spy on our army's position. The next day, our brave soldiers launched a counterattack against this group of enemies, driving them off the hill in one fell swoop, killing and wounding more than fifty of them. After this blow, the enemy dared not venture onto this hill again. They built fortifications on the eastern slope, attempting to gradually push towards the top. At this time, our army had already built fortifications on the hillside, controlling the top. On June 24th, the enemy army launched another attack on this hill, and the fierce battle lasted for three full days. The small number of our troops defending the summit continuously repelled six enemy charges and launched three counter-charges against the enemy, achieving the result of annihilating more than 240 enemies, then moved into tunnel fortifications to continue their defense. At this time, the enemy only managed to climb to the top of the hill with the superior force of one company. However, only one day later, our counter-attacking troops, in coordination with the brave soldiers defending the tunnels, fiercely counterattacked this enemy force which had not yet gained a foothold, quickly drove the enemy off the hill, occupied the favorable terrain of the hill, and continuously repelled six enemy reinforcements, killing and wounding more than 300 enemy soldiers. After the victory, our soldiers voluntarily withdrew from this hill. On the 29th, when the enemy cautiously climbed up this hill, it was deserted.

    The American invading army's 45th Division suffered more than 8,000 casualties in continuous operations in this area and could not continue fighting, so it had to be replaced by the American invading army's 2nd Division in mid-July. But the fate of the 2nd Division was even more tragic than that of the 45th Division, as it encountered an even greater blow on this small hilltop. On the night of July 17th, our army's long-range artillery fire and short-range artillery fire simultaneously bombarded fiercely, destroying most of the bunkers and shelters that the enemy had operated on this height for about twenty days in just six minutes. At this time, several of our assault teams immediately inserted into the enemy's ranks under the cover of dense machine gun fire, annihilating the entire company of the 23rd Regiment of the US 2nd Division. After our army completely occupied this hill, it immediately stepped up the construction of fortifications in preparation for repelling the enemy's counterattack. The next day, the US 2nd Division once again attacked this height with two companies to two battalions of infantry, eight aircraft, and more than ten tanks. Our army relied on the favorable terrain to carry out courageous resistance, continuously crushing sixteen frenzied charges by the enemy, killing and wounding more than 550 enemy soldiers, and holding the hill.

    After suffering heavy blows, the American invading army continued to attack this small hill after this battle. But what they encountered was still our army's strong resistance and counterattack. On July 19th, our army killed and wounded more than 250 American soldiers with artillery fire who were trying to invade. On the 22nd, our infantry killed and wounded more than 140 enemy soldiers with fierce gunfire. After a long period of fierce fighting, this small hill had been stripped bare by artillery fire and bombs, turning into a scorched and barren mountain. For the American invading army, this is their graveyard.

    记铁原前线一个山头的争夺战
    新华社记者　丁德润
    铁原以西一个无名高地的战斗，是几个月来朝鲜战线上山地争夺战中的典型战斗。从六月八日到八月三日的五十七天中，朝中人民军队在这个小小的高地上与美国侵略军进行反复的争夺战，用灵活的战术和很小的代价歼灭美军约两千名。
    这个高地是一个狭长形的小山岗，高二百多公尺，南北长三百多公尺，山顶只有十多公尺宽，位于敌我战线之间。它的西边是我军阵地，东边是敌军阵地。从六月上旬以来，在这个山头上不断发生反复的争夺战。
    六月七日，美国侵略军第四十五师的一个连偷偷地侵占了这个山头，妄图进窥我军阵地。第二天，我军勇士们就向这股敌人发起反击，一举将敌人赶下山去，杀伤其五十多名。敌人经这一打击后，不敢再贸然进到这个山头来了。他们在东面山坡上构筑工事，企图逐步地推向山顶。这时我军已在山坡上构筑了工事，控制了山顶。六月二十四日，敌军再次向这个山头发起攻击，激烈的争夺战延续了整整三天。据守山顶的我军少数部队连续打退敌军六次冲锋，并向敌人进行了三次反冲锋，取得歼敌二百四十多名的战果后，转入坑道工事继续坚守。这时敌军才用一个连的优势兵力爬上了山顶。但是仅仅隔了一天，我军反击部队就在据守坑道的勇士们的配合下，猛烈反击这股尚未站住脚跟的敌军，迅速就把敌军赶到山下去，并占据山头的有利地形，连续打退敌军援兵的六次反扑，杀伤敌军三百多名。获胜的我军战士们在这次战争后主动地撤离这座山头。二十九日，敌军战战兢兢地爬上这个山头时，山上已闃无一人。
    美国侵略军第四十五师由于在这一带的连续作战中伤亡了八千多人，不能继续作战，于是不得不在七月中旬换上美国侵略军第二师来接防。但是美二师的命运却比四十五师还要悲惨，它在这个小山顶上碰到了更大的打击。七月十七日夜，我军远射程炮火和近射程炮火同时猛烈地轰击，仅仅六分钟，就将敌军在这个高地上经营了二十天左右的地堡和掩蔽部大部摧毁。这时我军数支突击队马上在密集的机枪火力的掩护下，插入敌阵，将美军第二师第二十三团的一个连全部歼灭。我军在全部占领这个山头以后，即加紧修筑工事，准备迎击敌人的反扑。第二天，美军第二师即以两个连到两个营的步兵、八架飞机和十多辆战车，再次猛犯这个高地。我军凭借有利地形进行勇猛的抗击，连续打垮敌人十六次疯狂的冲锋，毙伤敌军五百五十多名，守住了这个山头。
    遭受惨重打击的美国侵略军，在这次战斗以后，仍然不断地进犯这座小山。但他们所遇到的仍然是我军坚强的阻击和反击。七月十九日，我军用炮火毙伤正图进犯的美军二百五十多名。二十二日，我军步兵用炽烈的枪火又毙伤了一百四十多名敌军。经过长期的激烈的争夺战，这个小小的山头已被炮火、炸弹打得寸草不存，变成了一座焦黄的秃山。对于美国侵略军来说，这是他们的大坟场。
