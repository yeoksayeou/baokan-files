    Guo Huaixiu of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army Overcomes Illiteracy
    To the Editor: I never went to school and don't recognize many characters, but I always wanted to tell the sisters across the country about the suffering I endured in the old society and how I was liberated and able to learn to read.
    I loved learning since I was little, but in the old society I never had the opportunity to go to school. When I was seventeen, my parents arranged a marriage for me. After the marriage, my husband's family treated me like an animal. My relationship with my husband's family deteriorated day by day, and I had the idea of getting a divorce. On the other hand, I also worked hard to study on my own. I practiced writing characters wherever I went, when I was cooking, when I was rolling noodles; in the dustpan, in the toilet. I secretly wrote behind people's backs, of course, with very little effect. Later, Chairman Mao liberated my hometown, and the village established women's literacy classes, but my mother-in-law wouldn't let me go; remedial classes were opened in the county town, and I wanted to go, but my mother-in-law blocked me in every possible way. I insisted on studying on my own. I went to pick up the slates that the elementary school students threw away to practice writing; at night, I secretly turned over my husband's family's old books and bound them into a notebook; without ink, I secretly took my husband's family's ink to use. But how unfree I was, I was still not liberated.
    I was determined to break free from the shackles. I demanded a divorce. But my husband threatened me, saying, "Even if you die, your bones will be crushed into oil, you can't leave." But I believed that as long as there was the Communist Party, all the unreasonable things in the old society would be completely overthrown. Later, the people's government sent a work team to our village to mobilize the masses to oppose traitors, oppose bullies, catch special agents, etc., and mobilize women to participate. This strengthened my fighting will. I boldly launched a struggle against the feudal family. Finally, I got divorced and joined the revolutionary ranks. Under the education of the Party, my class consciousness gradually increased, and in May 1949, I gloriously joined the Party.
    Recently, the higher authorities transferred me to participate in cultural studies, and the organization prepared tools for our studies, such as books, notebooks, and pens. Editor, comparing the present and the past, can you say that my heart is not filled with infinite emotion? I am full of strength, and I have great confidence in learning. I will definitely, under the leadership of the Party, work hard to improve my cultural, political, and professional level, and strive to do more work for the people.

    解放军某部郭怀秀文化翻身
    编辑同志：我没有上过学校，不认识多少字，但我总想把我在旧社会所受的痛苦和我怎样得到解放，怎样能够学习文化的情况，告诉全国的姊妹们。
    我从小很爱学习，可是在旧社会里一直没有进学校的机会。我十七岁那年，经父母包办结婚了。婚后，婆家把我当牛马看待。我和婆家的关系一天比一天坏，我有了要离婚的念头。另一方面，我也自己努力学习。我成天走到那里就在那里练习写字，做饭时写，赶面条时也写；在簸箕里写，在厕所里也写。我背着人暗暗地写，当然效果很小。后来，毛主席解放了我的家乡，村里成立了妇女识字班，但婆婆不让我去；县城里开办了补习班，我想去，婆婆更是百般阻挡。我坚持自己学习，我去拾小学生们扔掉不用的石板来练习写字；夜里，我暗暗地把婆家的老书翻过来订了个本子；没有墨，就暗暗地拿婆家的墨用。可是我多不自由啊，我还是没有解放。
    我决心挣脱枷锁。我要求离婚。可是我那丈夫却威胁我说：“你即使死了，骨头压成油也不能走。”但我相信只要有共产党，旧社会一切不合理的东西会被全部推翻的。后来，人民政府派了工作组到我们乡里，发动群众反奸，反霸，捉特务等等，并动员妇女们参加。这便加强了我的斗争意志。我大胆地和封建家庭开展了斗争。终于我离婚了，并参加了革命队伍。在党的教育下，我的阶级觉悟渐渐提高，一九四九年五月我光荣地入了党。
    最近，上级调我参加文化学习，学习工具譬如书、本子、笔，组织上都为我们准备好了。编辑同志，把现在和过去对比一下，你说我心中能不无限感慨吗？我满身都是力量，我对学习有很大的信心。我一定在党的领导下，努力提高文化，提高政治水平、业务水平，争取多为人民做些工作。
