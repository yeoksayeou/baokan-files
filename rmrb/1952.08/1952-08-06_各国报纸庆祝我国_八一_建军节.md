The Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, continuing to establish heroic achievements in annihilating the American and British imperialist beasts on the Korean front. These great victories show that the Chinese People's Army cannot be defeated by any invading army, and that it is a powerful armed force that will surely achieve final victory. The editorial concluded: The Chinese People's Liberation Army will certainly be able to smash all aggression by imperialist interventionists in the future. They will not only firmly defend the People's Republic of China, but will also make greater contributions to the cause of safeguarding lasting peace in Asia and the world. Greater glory and honor belong to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers!

The Chinese People's Liberation Army's achievement of such victories is by no means accidental. This is because this army is composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. It regards striving for the genuine liberation of the Chinese people and wholeheartedly defending their interests as its lofty mission. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is armed with the invincible weapon of Marxism-Leninism and the advanced military science of the Soviet Union. After a long period of revolutionary combat training, it has grown into a seasoned and invincible people's revolutionary armed force. The editorial concluded: The glorious armed force of 500 million Chinese people—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—has become an incomparably powerful force for defending peace in Asia today. It is deeply respected and trusted by the people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific region. The Korean people wholeheartedly congratulate their true comrades-in-arms—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—on the brilliant anniversary of its founding.

    The organ of the Vietnamese People's Army, "People's Army," published an editorial in its latest issue commemorating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The editorial stated that in the twenty-five years of struggle, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has continuously grown, overcome many difficulties, experienced many hardships, and achieved great victories. The editorial continued: Since its founding, the Vietnamese People's Army has continuously learned from the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Chairman Mao Zedong's military thinking. Thanks to their valuable experience, we have achieved many victories since the launch of the border offensive, eliminating more than 30,000 enemy troops; after the victory in the Hoa Binh campaign, we further strengthened our political study in order to ideologically transform ourselves. On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we pay tribute to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has carried out twenty-five years of great struggle, and express our gratitude to Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. We pledge to continue to learn from the Chinese People's Liberation Army so as to improve our political, tactical, and technical levels; we will continuously learn from the Chinese People's Liberation Army's heroic and unwavering fighting spirit in order to eliminate more enemy troops and carry out our struggle in the enemy's rear; we will continuously learn from and embody the Chinese People's Liberation Army's spirit of self-reliance in action in order to complete production and economic plans in accordance with President Ho Chi Minh's orders.

    The Indian "Free Press" published an editorial on August 1st entitled "Salute to the Chinese People's Liberation Army," stating: The victory of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army has inspired the people of dependent and colonial countries. The People's Liberation Army of New Democratic China is forever a comrade of peace fighters struggling against the imperialist warmongers' conspiracy to launch a third world war. The founding anniversary of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army will be warmly celebrated everywhere in the world. On this day, people all over the world will once again demand the conclusion of a five-power peace pact with China's participation to ensure world peace. The "Free Press" concluded: Salute to the great Chinese People's Liberation Army—the ever-vigilant vanguard defending world peace. Let the people throughout India pay tribute and offer congratulations to the People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. The Benares Hindi monthly "New China" published an editorial entitled "Salute" in its eleventh issue published on August 1st, praising the high degree of organization and political consciousness of the Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers and their contribution to the cause of peace in Asia.

The editorial stated: The mainstay of peace in Asia is precisely the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" published an article entitled "An Army that Deals Blows to U.S. Imperialism," detailing the history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the past twenty-five years, and stating: "The army of 475 million people is invincible. The long and glorious history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is inseparable from the Chinese people's struggle for freedom and independence. Its victory is the victory of the Chinese workers and peasants advancing towards socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea has dealt a devastating blow to the American interventionists, proving that it is an invincible force."

    The Polish "Trybuna Ludu" published an editorial on August 1st entitled "Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," stating: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army grew out of the people. As the liberator of the people, it defends the Chinese people, opposes the conspiracies of American imperialism, and opposes the threat of the Japanese Bushido army that the United States is reviving. The Chinese Volunteers, fighting alongside their Korean brothers to resist the American murderers, are defending China's freedom and defending peace in the Far East. Maintaining a comrade-in-arms relationship with the invincible Soviet Army and the armies of the People's Democracies, the strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a powerful obstacle on the path of America's arrogant provocations against the People's China, a powerful obstacle on the path of America's expansionist aggression in the Far East, and an unbreakable link in the anti-imperialist world front led by Stalin. On the occasion of the glorious festival of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Polish people extend their heartfelt congratulations to the fraternal Chinese people and their army, wishing them to strengthen their fighting forces and wishing them further success in our common struggle for world peace."

    The Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" wrote: The democratic countries and working people of the world are joyfully celebrating the founding anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In talking about the struggle carried out by the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, it said: The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have dealt heavy blows to the American interventionist army. The Bulgarian people extend brotherly congratulations to the Chinese people and their army, and hope that they will achieve new victories in the struggle against the American robbers and for peace, as well as in their work for the prosperity of the People's Republic of China.
