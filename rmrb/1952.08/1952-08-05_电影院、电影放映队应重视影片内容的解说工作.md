Cinemas and Film Projection Teams Should Emphasize Explaining Film Content

Editor's Note: We published a short commentary entitled "Helping Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Watch Movies" on page three of this newspaper on June 15th, a summary of readers' letters entitled "More Publicity Should Be Done Before and After Film Screenings" in the Reader Letters column on June 30th, and "China Film Management Company Head Office Pays Attention to the Publicity and Explanation of Translated Films" on page three of this newspaper on July 3rd. Some places have already begun to pay attention to this work, but many cinemas and film projection teams do not pay enough attention to this work, and very few cinemas issue brochures before screenings. Here we publish four readers' letters and submissions on this issue. The situation reflected by reader Zuo Hua Wu is noteworthy. The experience of the General Political Department Film Team of the Military Commission in conducting film explanation work in a certain army, as reported by Ding Xian Ge, and the method recommended by Xi Jin You of the Wuhan Zhongyuan Cinema of adding subtitles to explain films during screenings, are also worthy of reference by various screening institutions.

Suggest Cinemas Issue Film Brochures

Editor: Our impressions after watching Soviet films several times are always vague. Sometimes we regard progressive characters as backward, and even revolutionary characters as reactionary. For example, when we watched the Soviet film "The Defence of Tsaritsyn," we found the characters and events confusing. Some classmates in our school said, "I don't understand it, I might as well not watch it." After the Soviet film "A Happy Life" was screened, many people were also confused about its entire content. Therefore, I suggest that cinemas issue brochures. The relevant leading departments should pay attention to this work in order to achieve the educational purpose of films for the audience. Zuo Hua Wu

Explanatory Work Should Be Carried Out When Showing Films to Farmers

Editor: More and more films are being shown in the countryside. It is so exciting that we can watch movies frequently now. I have one request: the comrades of the film projection teams who go to the countryside should often carry out the work of explaining the films when showing them.

A few months ago, the masses of Huinan Town in Southern Jiangsu watched the Soviet film "Lenin in 1918." Due to the lack of necessary explanatory work, the audience did not understand the content of the film, and therefore this good film failed to play its due role. Although Chinese films are more familiar, the content of the films cannot be fully understood either.

We think that it is certainly good to explain the film before it is shown, but if it is a large venue with many people and disorder, the effect of explanatory work before the screening is not very good. If the explanation is carried out according to the development of the film's plot, this is what the masses need most. In order to give full play to the educational role of films, I request that every comrade of the projection team who goes to the countryside can do this. Ye Yan

Welcome to Wuhan Zhongyuan Cinema for Coordinating Subtitle Explanations When Showing Films

Editor: Wuhan Zhongyuan Cinema has recently added concise subtitle explanations when showing films, which is one of the most effective ways to help the audience (especially workers and peasant audiences) understand the content of the film. Taking my viewing of the Polish film "Warsaw Street" this time as an example, because I read the subtitle explanations while watching the film, I had a deeper understanding of the film's content. If there were no subtitle explanations, I would not have known that the deep cave was the sewer; if there were no subtitle explanations, I would not have understood the complex relationships of the characters in the film so clearly, and I would not have understood the German invaders' vicious national oppression policy against Polish Jews so thoroughly.

I think this practice of Zhongyuan Cinema is very good and worthy of promotion. Therefore, I suggest that if cinemas in various places have not adopted this method, they should quickly adopt it universally. Xi Jin You

Doing a Good Job in Film Explanation Can Strengthen the Educational Role of Films for the Masses

Editor: In the past, the comrades of the film projection team of the General Political Department of the Military Commission did not pay much attention to the explanation and publicity of film content, thinking that it was a burden. Although some publicity work was done in the past, it was mostly just reading the story of the brochure rigidly before the film was shown. No timely explanation was carried out during the screening, nor were other effective methods used to help soldiers watch films; therefore, soldiers could not understand some translated films. For example, in "The Third Blow," the soldiers could not distinguish which were German invaders and which were Soviet Red Army soldiers. In the film "Chapayev," there was a scene in which the White Army used "spiritual tactics," rushing up beating drums and holding guns. Because the soldiers did not understand what was going on, they wanted to applaud and welcome them. The soldiers generally could not understand the film "Sverdlov."

Based on the above situation, the film team of the General Political Department of the Military Commission conducted a special film propaganda work experiment in a certain army. Our experience is as follows: 1. Do a good job of explanation before the screening, but you should not simply read the story. It is difficult to explain the story completely before the audience has watched the film. You should focus on explaining what the central meaning of the film is and what you can learn from the film. Briefly put forward a few points. 2. Focus on doing a good job of timely explanation during the screening. During the film screening, seize the gaps and introduce the main characters of the film and explain important plots in a timely manner. This work is the key to enabling the audience to understand the film. For example, when screening "The Revolutionary Cradle: Vyborg Side," when the protagonist Maxim appeared on the screen, quickly introduce to the audience: "This is Maxim." When anarchists appear, immediately explain: "These are counter-revolutionaries, they are carrying out rumors and sabotage activities." This method was praised by the soldiers, who said: "We were just confused, and just wanted to ask others what was being performed in the film, and the projectionist explained it clearly." In this way, soldiers can understand many translated films. 3. Hold a forum after the screening, which is one of the good methods to use collective strength to help soldiers understand the content of the film more deeply and accept the film's education. This work should be valued by the political work departments at all levels of the troops, and they should organize projectionists to assist in the discussion.

When the projectionist carries out the above work, the projectionist must fully understand the content of the film and be familiar with every shot of the film in order to do a good job of explanation during the screening. The projection team must first study and grasp the central content of each newly screened film. When explaining during the screening, the explanation should be short and clear. The projectionist must grasp the situation in the shots, so that his voice is not too loud and does not conflict with the sound of the film, so as to not hinder the audience from listening to the film's dialogue, and to help the audience understand the film's content.

### 电影院、电影放映队应重视影片内容的解说工作

专栏：读者来信

    电影院、电影放映队应重视影片内容的解说工作
    编者按：我们曾于六月十五日在本报三版发表了“帮助工农兵看电影”的简评，六月三十日在读者来信栏发表了读者来信综述“电影放映前后应多作宣传工作”，七月三日本报三版发表了“中国影片经理公司总公司注意关于翻译片的宣传解释工作”。这项工作，有些地方已经开始注意做了，但还有不少电影院和电影放映队对这项工作不够重视，很少电影院在放映前发说明书。这里我们发表了四封有关这一问题的读者来信和来稿。读者左华五所反映的情况是值得注意的。丁宪阁所报道的军委总政治部电影队在某军试验作电影解说工作的经验及席金友所推荐的武汉中原电影院在放映电影时配上字幕说明的办法，也值得各放映机构参考。
    建议电影院发电影说明书
    编辑同志：我们数次看过苏联影片后，所得到的印象总是模糊的。有时把进步的人物当成是落后的，甚至把革命的人物当成反动的。例如我们看苏联影片“保卫察里津”时，就觉得其中的人物、事件混淆不清。我校有的同学说：“看不懂，趁早别看算了。”苏联影片“幸福的生活”放映后，也有不少人弄不清它的全部内容。所以我建议电影院发说明书。有关的领导部门应对此项工作加以重视，以达到电影对观众的教育目的。  左华五
    给农民放映电影要进行解释工作
    编辑同志：电影越来越多地深入到农村中放映了，现在我们能经常看电影，这是多么兴奋的事啊。我有一个要求：深入到农村中去的电影放映队的同志们，在放电影的时候，应该时常对电影进行解说的工作。
    几个月以前，我们苏南惠南镇群众看过苏联影片“列宁在一九一八”，由于缺乏必要的解释工作，观众看不懂这部影片的内容，因而这部好影片未能起应有的作用。看中国片子，虽然比较熟悉一些，但是影片的内容也不能完全看懂。
    我们觉得，在没有放映电影以前，对影片作一番解说固然是好的，但是如果是大场子，人多秩序乱，放映前作解说工作的效果也不太好。如果按照影片情节发展，进行解说，这是群众最需要的。为了发挥电影的教育作用，我要求每一个深入农村的放映队同志，都能做到这一点。  叶言
    欢迎武汉中原电影院放映影片时配合字幕说明
    编辑同志：武汉中原电影院最近在放映影片时配上简明的字幕说明，这是帮助观众（特别是工农观众）了解影片内容的最有效的办法之一。就以我这次看波兰电影“华沙一条街”来说，因为我在看影片时看了字幕说明，就使我对电影内容有了比较深刻的了解。假如没有字幕说明，我就不会知道那深邃的大洞就是下水道；假如没有字幕的说明，我就不会这样清楚地了解影片中人物的复杂关系，不会那样彻底地了解德寇对波兰籍的犹太人的民族高压政策的毒辣。
    我认为中原电影院的这种做法是非常好的，是值得推广的。因此，我建议：假如各地影院没有采用这种办法的话，应该赶快普遍采用起来。  席金友
    做好影片解说工作能加强影片对群众的教育作用
    编辑同志：关于电影内容的解释、宣传工作，过去军委总政治部电影放映队的同志们是不大重视的，认为这是一种负担。过去虽也作了一些宣传工作，但多在电影放映前死板地按说明书的故事念一遍，在放映间没有进行过及时的解释，也没有采用别的有效方法，帮助战士看电影；所以战士们对有些翻译影片看不懂。如“第三次打击”，战士们就分不清影片中那些是德寇，那些是苏联红军。影片“夏伯阳”中有一个镜头，本来是白党军队使用“精神战术”，打着鼓、端着枪冲上来的情形，战士们因为没有弄清是怎么回事，便很想鼓掌欢迎。“斯维尔德洛夫”一片，战士们也普遍看不懂。
    根据以上情况，军委总政治部电影队在某军专门作了电影宣传工作的试验，我们的体会是这样：一、作好放映前的解释工作，但不应单纯地把故事念一遍，因每部影片的故事在观众没有看电影前，你想把故事完全讲明白，这是很难的。应着重说明影片的中心意义是什么，从这部影片里学习些什么？简单扼要地提出几点。二、着重做好放映间的及时解释工作。在电影放映时，抓紧空隙，及时地介绍影片的主要人物和解释重要的情节。这一工作是使观众看懂电影的关键。如放映“革命摇篮维堡区”时，银幕上出现了影片主角马克辛时，赶紧给观众介绍：“这就是马克辛”。出现无政府主义者时，马上说明：“这是反革命分子，他们进行造谣、破坏活动。”这种办法得到战士们的赞扬，他们说：“我们刚刚糊涂，正想问别人影片里所表演的是怎样回事时，放映员给解释清楚了。”这样作，有许多翻译影片，战士们都可以看懂了。三、映后开座谈会，这是运用集体力量帮助战士更深刻地了解影片内容，接受影片教育的良好方法之一。这项工作应得到部队各级政治工作部门的重视，由他们组织放映员协助进行讨论。
    在放映员进行以上工作时，放映员必须对影片的内容完全了解，对影片的每个镜头都要熟悉，这样才能作好放映中的解释工作。放映队必须对每部新放映的影片，先研究、掌握它的中心内容。在放映中解说时，解说词要简短、明了，放映员必须掌握镜头中的情况，使自己讲解的声音不要太大，不要与影片的声音冲突，做到既不妨碍观众去听影片的对话，又帮助观众去了解影片内容。  丁宪阁
