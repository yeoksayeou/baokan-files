    Military Dependent Wang Lao Fei Actively Leads the Masses to Participate in the Patriotic Production Increase Movement
    Editor: Model military dependent Wang Lao Fei, 61 years old, is the director of the Hexi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huguan County, Shanxi Province. He is a second-class agricultural labor model in Shanxi Province and also a military dependent representative attending the Shanxi Provincial People's Representative Conference. He actively leads the masses to participate in the patriotic production increase movement. He organized the masses to form mutual aid groups early on. Then he took the lead in using new farm tools. In the spring of 1950, he tried using a new-style walking plow for the first time, but failed, and was criticized by some. However, he persisted in trying, and finally succeeded. Mutual aid groups in various villages in the district accepted Wang Lao Fei's experiences and lessons, and also adopted new-style walking plows. Soon, there were fifty or sixty new-style walking plows in the entire district. Before long, Wang Lao Fei's mutual aid group also used weeding hoes, small seeders, corn threshers, insecticide sprayers, thermometers, and other new-style agricultural implements. Every year during cultivation, he leads the group members to use chemicals to treat seeds and improve the soil, etc. In the past, the average yield per mu of land here was only seven dou of grain, but now it can produce two shi and five dou per mu. This year, Wang Lao Fei has further organized an agricultural production cooperative, with more than 350 mu of land and more than 400 sheep joining the cooperative. They plan to increase production by 70 jin of grain per mu this year.
    Although Wang Lao Fei is old, he still declines to have others plow for him and helps others accumulate fertilizer. He often writes letters to encourage his son to work hard. This year on May Day, he even challenged his son to strive to make contributions to the motherland together.

    军属王老肥积极领导群众参加爱国增产运动
    编辑同志：模范军属王老肥，现年六十一岁，山西省壶关县河西村农业生产合作社主任。他是山西全省二等农业劳动模范，也是出席全省各界人民代表会议的军属代表。他积极领导群众，参加爱国增产运动。他老早便组织群众成立了互助组。接着他又带头使用新式农具。一九五○年春天，他第一次试用新式步犁，失败了，并且受到了一些非难。但是他坚持试用的结果，终于得到成功。全区各村的互助组接受了王老肥的经验教训，也纷纷采用新式步犁。全区很快便有了五、六十张新式步犁。不久，王老肥的互助组内又使用了耘锄、小型播种机、玉米脱粒机、杀虫喷雾器、温度表等新式农业器械。每年耕作时，他都领导组员用药剂拌种、改良土壤等等。过去，这里每亩土地平均只产七斗粮，现在每亩可以产两石五斗了。今年，王老肥更进一步组织了农业生产合作社，入社土地计有三百五十多亩，羊四百多只。他们计划今年每亩增产七十斤粮食。
    王老肥虽然年老了，但他还谢绝代耕，并帮助别人积肥。他常写信鼓励他的儿子好好工作。今年“五一”节时，他更向儿子提出挑战，争取共同为祖国立功。    高虎如
