    Fire Zone Should Be Sealed Off Promptly

    Editor: The old lane mining area of the No. 211 production team of the No. 1 Mine of the Jingxing Coal Mine, due to technical personnel’s measurement errors, led to the excavation of the old mining fire zone (this fire zone was discovered in 1949 and was sealed off at the time), causing air leakage in the old mining fire zone. On July 26th, the temperature in this mining area was as high as 47 degrees Celsius, and on the 30th, it reached 56 degrees Celsius. However, the leading cadres of this mine did not pay attention to this problem and delayed the sealing work for four days until the 30th. I believe that the negligence and neglect of safety by the leading cadres of this mine is intolerable. If the old mining fire zone is not sealed and blocked in time, the fire zone will spread and expand, causing disasters. I hope they can be vigilant. Mao Shifen

    发火区应该及时严密封闭
    编辑同志：井陉煤矿第一矿第二一一生产小组的老法回采区，由于技术人员测量错误，以致掘进了老塘发火区（这个发火区在一九四九年发现，当时曾经密闭），引起老塘发火区漏风。七月二十六日这个回采区温度高达摄氏四十七度，三十日达五十六度。但是这个矿的领导干部并不重视这个问题，拖延了四天，到三十日才准备做封闭工作。我认为这个矿的领导干部这种麻痹大意、忽视保安的态度，是不能容忍的。老塘发火区如不及时密闭堵塞，发火区将会蔓延扩大，造成灾害，希望他们能够引起警惕。毛士芬
