    Editor's Note: Since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, many factories and mines have been promoting advanced experiences and have achieved certain results. However, how to promote advanced experiences? Many leading cadres in factories and mines still lack experience in this regard; some leading cadres in factories and mines even hold incorrect attitudes. In order to exchange experiences in promoting advanced experiences, we have organized this exchange and discussion of work experiences on the theme of "How to Promote Advanced Industrial Experiences" in order to seek some correct methods so that our Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign can develop victoriously. There are many problems in promoting advanced experiences. This time we mainly study and discuss three issues: 1. What attitude should leading cadres hold towards promoting advanced experiences? 2. What ideological concerns do the masses of workers and staff have about promoting advanced experiences? How should leading cadres help them dispel their concerns? 3. How to organize the masses to learn from advanced experiences? We hope that leading cadres (including administration, Party branches, trade unions, the Communist Youth League), technicians and workers can put forward their work experiences and various problems for research based on the actual situation of promoting advanced experiences in various factories and mines.

    Why Our Plan for Promoting Advanced Experiences Has Not Been Completed
    Xue Qi, Director of Hegang Mining Bureau

    Before May of this year, the Hegang Mining Bureau, according to instructions from higher authorities, pointed out to the entire bureau that promoting advanced experience was the basic method for increasing production and practicing economy, and carried out some ideological education and organizational work to promote advanced experience, and formulated the "Decision on Requirements and Specific Measures Plan for Promoting Advanced Experience." However, as of mid-July, the state of learning advanced experiences in the entire bureau was not satisfactory. The entire promotion work was slow and stagnant. Advanced experiences were neither widely nor rapidly promoted, and promotion plans were generally not completed. For example, it was originally stipulated that seven rapid tunneling teams should promote Cui Guoshan's tunneling experience, but only two teams implemented it; it was originally planned that nine drilling rigs would learn Ma Wenzhi's rapid drilling experience, but only three drilling rigs learned it. The situation in other types of work is also roughly the same.

    If the plan for promoting advanced experience is not completed, the plan for increasing production and practicing economy cannot be completed. According to statistics from three mines: among the 89 direct labor groups, only 29 groups completed the plan, and among the 55 indirect labor groups, only 39 groups completed the plan. Moreover, these groups only completed the production plan, and the savings plan was not completed.

    Why can't advanced experience be promoted for a long time? You can often hear everyone has some reasons: First, workers have conservative ideas and are unwilling to learn advanced experience; Second, the technical conditions are not enough, and the natural conditions are not good; Third, the materials are not supplied, and the work is not well coordinated. These three situations are indeed the main problems in the work of promoting advanced experience, but where is the key to solving these problems?

    There is no doubt that workers have conservative ideas. This is because they have used an operating method for a long time and are familiar with this operating method. When they have not really understood the advantages of the new method from the point of view of reason and practice, they naturally find it difficult to accept the new method. At the same time, in the process of learning, some workers often have some concerns, such as fear that the quota will be raised, etc. But as long as the leading cadres earnestly and specifically carry out ideological education work for the workers, these problems are not difficult to solve.

    Let's examine the situation of our propaganda and education work. On July 14, we conducted a test among engineers, technicians, trade union chairmen, Party branch secretaries, and pit and workshop directors. The topic was to explain the specific content of certain advanced experiences in the coal mine system. Only 45 out of 284 people passed the exam. Someone even said: "Lv Wenping's experience (mechanized coal mining) is the same as Cui Guoshan's experience (rapid tunneling)." This shows that some cadres do not even understand what the content of advanced experience is. How can they educate workers? Of course, they can only shout empty slogans about promoting advanced experience; some people even mystify advanced experience. The result of this propaganda and education can only make the workers confused and do not know where the advanced experience is good. Another shortcoming in propaganda and education work is that the upper-level cadres talk a lot, but do not pay attention to listening to the opinions and requirements of the masses below. In this way, it is impossible to solve the problems that the masses need to solve most. For example, some wage problems and welfare problems cannot be solved in time, thus affecting production. From here, it can also be seen where the key to the so-called problem of workers' ideological incomprehension lies.

    The situation that the technical conditions are not enough and the difficulties caused by the changes in natural conditions also exist. For example, the drilling team has had many accidents because many technical problems have not been scientifically solved. However, can this be regarded as an insurmountable objective difficulty? Suppose the leadership can organize the technicians into the work of promoting advanced experience in a timely manner, let them go deep into the site and take various necessary technical measures in time, wouldn't the various technical difficulties in the promotion work be solved!

    The so-called problems of insufficient material supply and poor coordination of work are not insurmountable difficulties, but a manifestation of our organizational work and management work failing to keep up with the creative labor of workers. Here is an example: the drilling rig room leaked, and the drilling team asked for iron plates. The iron plate in the warehouse was pressed under other materials. The warehouse management personnel, because they were afraid of trouble, told the drilling team that "there was no iron plate," so that the problem was delayed for a long time and could not be solved. The cadres of the business departments and auxiliary workshops do not have a clear view of serving the direct production site and serving the work of promoting advanced experience. When the lower levels come to ask for materials, some people treat them with an attitude of "I won't serve you." They still think that they are "managing the lower levels." As a result, the site is often affected by the shortage of raw materials. The coordination between various types of work is a specific organizational work that must be carried out in the promotion of advanced experience. However, our efforts in this area are also not enough. The reason why various organizational work cannot keep up with the needs of promoting advanced experience is related to the fact that the leading agencies of our bureau and mine have not been organized. When dealing with problems, these agencies still follow the old rules and use the old methods, "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts." There is no complete set of methods and systems. Therefore, the workers said: "We have circulation here (referring to circulation charts), but you don't circulate; we want guarantees, but you don't guarantee?"

    From these situations, it can be clearly seen that the key problem in the failure to complete the plan for promoting advanced experience is that cadres at all levels have not plunged themselves into the upsurge of promoting advanced experience, have not earnestly learned advanced experience, and have not transformed their ideological style and work methods according to the needs of promoting advanced experience.

    Based on the shortcomings in the work during this period, we will immediately take the following measures to quickly reverse this situation. First, we must concentrate the propaganda forces of the Party, administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League, and use various forms to carry out in-depth propaganda work so that everyone can understand the benefits of advanced experience and know the content of advanced experience. At the same time, we must continuously carry out ideological struggle and resolutely expose and criticize the bureaucratic work style of those who talk empty words, sing high-pitched tunes, and do not take responsibility for solving problems. Second, we must organize to solve problems and create conditions for promotion work. For example, organize various business departments to go deep into the site, be responsible separately, and solve various problems in promotion work; organize meetings of various types of work on the site to solve the problems of coordination between various types of work and material supply, so as to carry out production according to the instruction charts; organize technicians to solve the changes in natural conditions and technical problems in production; all pit and workshop entrances should establish advanced experience promotion committees, and advanced experience exchange meetings will be held separately according to the system. Third, establish various necessary systems, such as the special responsibility system and reward system for promotion work, and strengthen cadre learning to ensure the smooth progress of promotion work.

    If we can earnestly transform our ideological style and work methods, thoroughly criticize bureaucratic work style, the situation of promoting advanced experience work can be greatly changed.

    Why Our Work in Promoting Advanced Experience Took a Detour
    Qiao Guiyuan, Manager of the Civil Engineering Company of the State Electric Power Administration

    In the process of promoting Su Changyou's bricklaying method, the Eleventh Engineering Team of our Civil Engineering Company of the State Electric Power Administration encountered an abnormal phenomenon. There were four bricklaying teams on this construction site that adopted Su Changyou's bricklaying method, while other bricklayers still used the old method. Recently, the walls built by these four groups were of very poor quality: the walls were not straight, the brick seams were uneven, and the vertical seams were insufficient in mortar. Some needed to be reworked. On the other hand, the walls built by the bricklayers who did not learn Su Changyou's bricklaying method maintained their general quality. Why is the quality of the advanced experience learning group worse? Supervisor Shen Zhongxiang said: "Of course, the quality of the houses built by the post office on the east side is good if they lay a brick in three minutes." According to him, the reason for the poor quality is that learning advanced experience has improved work efficiency. This is obviously wrong. The superiority of Su Changyou's bricklaying method has been proven by countless facts. The Eighth Engineering Team of our engineering company has already achieved very good results in promoting Su Changyou's bricklaying method, and the promotion situation on other construction sites is also normal. So, what is the reason for the poor quality of these four groups?

    After preliminary inspection, we believe that the reason why the Eleventh Engineering Team did not achieve the expected results in promoting advanced experience lies in the fact that the leadership of our engineering company treated the work of promoting advanced experience on this construction site with a bureaucratic attitude.

    Promoting advanced experience is a process of struggle between advanced ideas and backward conservative ideas, and a complex and meticulous process of production reform. Therefore, in the process of promoting advanced experience, the leadership must carry out in-depth and specific ideological education and careful organizational work. But we treat this work with a perfunctory attitude. At the beginning of the promotion of Su Changyou's advanced experience, because some larger projects had not yet started, we sent an advanced experience promotion team that had undergone short-term training to the Eleventh Engineering Area to carry out promotion work. At that time, we just made a general arrangement at the meeting and thought that everything would be fine and advanced experience could be smoothly promoted. When arranging work, we did not understand the ideological status of the on-site responsible cadres and workers and the situation of the promotion team. Later, various projects started one after another. Because the project of the Eleventh Engineering Team was not large and relatively simple, we relaxed our leadership and did not go there for in-depth investigation and inspection, let alone provide specific assistance on the site. We were not aware of it until the problem occurred on the construction site and the user unit raised objections.

    Due to the bureaucracy of the leadership, we could not correct the incorrect thinking and style of the on-site responsible cadres and the leader of the advanced experience promotion team in time. The leader of the construction site had a very serious conservative ideology and held a negative attitude towards promoting advanced experience. At the same time, he did not pay enough attention to the project on this construction site, so he completely abandoned leadership over the promotion work. The two supervisors on the construction site did not pay attention to the work of promoting advanced experience, and even held a skeptical attitude towards advanced experience. After the problem occurred, they thought that "it's okay if it's fast." The leader of the promotion team sent to the construction site also lacked a correct understanding of his task. When he arrived at the construction site, he wanted to be a supervisor. In addition, the leader of the construction site abandoned leadership over the promotion work, and this team leader soon left production. As a result, the promotion work was only carried out by a few bricklayers in the promotion team who could not fully master the new bricklaying method, and completely fell into a state of free flow with no one in charge. Under such circumstances, how could the promotion work not have problems!

    Accepting the lessons of this failure, we deeply realize that the bureaucratic work style of the leadership is the biggest obstacle to promoting advanced experience. If we only make arrangements and mobilization, without conducting in-depth investigation and research, without carrying out specific ideological education and organizational work, and without conducting regular inspection, supervision and assistance, advanced experience cannot be smoothly promoted. In the future, we will strive to overcome the bureaucratic work style of the leadership and carry out the work of promoting advanced experience in an organized and planned manner with a serious and responsible attitude.

### 怎样推广工业的先进经济？

    怎样推广工业的先进经济？
    编者按：增产节约运动开始以后，许多工厂、矿山都在推广先进经验，并已收到一定的成绩。但是，怎样才能推广先进经验呢？很多工厂、矿山的领导干部对此还缺乏经验；有些工厂、矿山的领导干部甚至还抱有不正确的态度。为了交流推广先进经验中的经验，我们特组织这样一个以“怎样推广工业的先进经验”为题的工作经验的交谈和讨论，以便寻求一些正确的方法，使我们的增产节约运动能够胜利地向前发展。推广先进经验工作中的问题很多，我们这次主要是研究和讨论三个问题：一、领导干部对推广先进经验应该抱什么态度？二、职工群众中对推广先进经验有些什么思想顾虑？领导干部应该怎样帮助他们解除顾虑？三、如何组织群众学习先进经验？我们希望领导干部（包括行政、党支部、工会、青年团）、技术人员和工人，都能根据各工厂、矿山推广先进经验的实际情况，将工作经验和各项问题提出来进行研究。
    我们推广先进经验的计划为什么没有完成
    鹤岗矿务局局长  薛奇
    在今年五月以前，鹤岗矿务局就根据上级指示，向全局指出推广先进经验是增产节约的基本方法，并作了一些推广先进经验的思想教育工作和组织工作，制定了“推广先进经验的要求和具体措施计划的决定”。但是，到七月中旬为止，全局学习先进经验的状况是不能令人满意的。整个推广工作是迟滞不前的，先进经验推广得既不普遍又不迅速，推广计划一般都没有完成。比如，原来规定要有七个快速掘进组推广崔国山的掘进经验，结果只有两个组实行了；原订九台钻机要学习马文志的快速钻进经验，结果只有三台钻机学了。其他各工种的情况也大体如此。
    推广先进经验的计划没有完成，增产节约计划也就无法完成。据三个矿的统计：八十九个直接工种的小组中，只二十九个小组完成了计划，五十五个间接工种的小组中，仅三十九个小组完成了计划。并且，这些小组也只是完成了生产计划，节约计划并未完成。
    为什么先进经验迟迟不能推广呢？常常可以听到大家有这么一些理由：第一，工人有保守思想，不愿学习先进经验；第二，技术条件不够，自然条件不好；第三，材料供应不上，工种配合不好。这三种情况确实是推广先进经验工作中的主要问题，但是，这些问题不能解决的关键又何在呢？
    工人有保守思想是不容置疑的。这是因为他们长时期地沿用一种操作方法，熟悉了这种操作方法，当他们还没有从道理上和实践中真正体会到新的方法的优越性时，他们自然很难接受新的方法。同时，在学习的过程中，部分工人也常常还会有一些顾虑，例如怕定额提高了等等。但是只要领导干部认真地具体地对工人进行了思想教育工作，这些问题是并不难解决的。
    我们检查一下我们的宣传教育工作的状况。七月十四日，我们在工程师、技术员、工会主席、党的支部书记以及坑长车间主任等人员中进行了一次测验，题目是说明煤矿系统中某些先进经验的具体内容。在二百八十四人中仅有四十五人考试及格。有人竟说：“吕文平经验（机械化采煤）和崔国山经验（快速掘进）一样。”这说明某些干部自己还不懂得先进经验的内容是什么，他们怎样去教育工人呢？当然就只有空喊推广先进经验了；有些人甚至把先进经验神秘化起来。这样宣传教育的结果，只能让工人莫名其妙，而不知先进经验究竟好在何处。宣传教育工作中的另一个缺点是：上边的干部讲得很多，而不注意倾听下面群众的意见和要求。这样就不能有的放矢地解决群众所最需要解决的问题。比如，有些工资问题、福利问题不能及时解决因而影响生产。从这里也就可以看出所谓工人思想不通问题的关键何在了。
    技术条件不够以及因自然条件的变化而造成的困难的情况也是存在的。比如钻探队就曾因为许多技术问题没有得到科学地解决而发生了多次事故。但是，这难道可以算是不可克服的客观困难吗？假使领导方面能够及时地把技术人员组织到推广先进经验的工作中去，让他们深入现场及时采取各种必要的技术措施，推广工作中的各种技术上的困难不就是可以解决了吗！
    所谓材料供应不上和工种配合不好的问题，也并不是什么不可克服的困难，而是我们的组织工作和管理工作赶不上工人创造性的劳动的一个表现。这里有一个例子：钻探的机房漏雨，钻探队提出要铁板。仓库中的铁板压在别的材料的下面了，仓库管理人员因为怕麻烦，竟然告诉钻探队说“没有铁板”，以致这个问题拖延很久不得解决。业务部门的干部和辅助车间为直接生产的现场服务，为推广先进经验工作服务的观点是不明确的。下边来要材料时，有人竟以“我不侍候你”的态度相待，他们仍然认为自己是“管下级”的。因之，现场上常因原材料不够用而影响生产。各工种间的配合，是推广先进经验中必须进行的一项具体的组织工作。但是，我们在这方面的努力也是不够的。各种组织工作所以赶不上推广先进经验的需要，是和我们局矿的领导机构办事机构未能组织起来有关的。这些机构在处理问题时还是因循旧例用老一套的办法，“头疼医头，脚疼医脚”，没有一套成套的办法与制度。因此工人们说：“我们这里有循环（指循环图表），你们不循环；我们要保证，你们保证不？”
    从这些情况已经可以很清楚地看出，推广先进经验的计划所以不能完成，关键问题是各方面的干部还没有把自己卷进推广先进经验的热潮中去，没有认真地学习先进经验，没有根据推广先进经验的需要来改造自己的思想作风和工作方法。
    根据这一时期工作中的缺点，我们将立即采取以下几种措施，以便迅速扭转这种情况。第一，必须集中党、行政、工会、青年团的宣传力量，利用各种形式深入地进行宣传工作，使人人都能懂得先进经验的好处，知道先进经验的内容。同时，必须不断开展思想斗争，坚决揭发批判那些说空话、唱高调，而不负责任解决问题的官僚主义作风。第二，必须组织起来为推广工作解决问题创造条件。比如，组织各业务部门深入现场，分头负责，解决推广工作中的各种问题；组织现场各工种的会议，解决各工种的配合问题和材料供应问题，作到按指示图表进行生产；组织技术人员解决自然条件变化以及生产中的技术问题；各坑口车间都应成立推广先进经验委员会，并将按系统分别召开推广交流先进经验的会议。第三，建立各种必要的制度，如推广工作的专责制、奖励制，并加强干部的学习等，以保证推广工作顺利进行。
    假使我们能够认真地改造我们的思想作风和工作方法，彻底批判官僚主义作风，推广先进经验工作的状况是可以大大改变的。
    我们推广先进经验的工作为什么走了弯路
    电业管理总局土木建筑工程公司经理  乔贵元
    我们电业管理总局土木建筑工程公司所属第十一工程组，在推广苏长有砌砖法的过程中，曾经发生了一个不正常的现象。这个工地上有四个瓦工组采用了苏长有砌砖法，其他瓦工仍沿用旧法。最近，这四个小组砌的墙质量很差：墙面不直、砖缝大小不一、竖缝灰浆不足，有的须要返工。而没有学习苏长有砌砖法的瓦工所砌的墙反而保持了一般的质量。为什么学习先进经验小组的质量反而会坏呢？监工员沈忠祥说：“东边邮局盖房子用三分钟砌一块砖当然可以质量好。”照他的说法，质量坏的原因是因为学习了先进经验提高了工作效率。这显然是错误的。苏长有砌砖法的优越性已经为无数次的事实所证明。我们工程公司的第八工程组，推广苏长有砌砖法就已经收到了很好的效果，其他工地的推广情况也还正常。那么，这四个小组质量坏的原因究竟何在呢？
    经过初步检查，我们认为十一工程组推广先进经验所以没有收到预期的结果，关键在于我们工程公司的领导方面用官僚主义的态度对待这一工地的推广先进经验工作。
    推广先进经验是一个先进思想同落后的保守思想的斗争过程，是复杂的细致的生产改革过程。因之，在推广先进经验的过程中，领导方面就必须进行深入的具体的思想教育工作和周密的组织工作。而我们却是用草率从事的态度来对待这一工作。在开始推广苏长有的先进经验时，因为有些较大的工程还没有开工，就派了一个经过短期训练的推广先进经验小组到十一工程区进行推广工作。当时只是在会议上做了一般的布置就以为百事大吉，先进经验可以顺利推广了。在布置工作时，对于现场负责干部和工人的思想状况以及推广小组的情况是不了解的，以后各处工程纷纷开工，因为十一工程组的工程不大并且比较简单，因而又放松了领导，没有到该处去作过深入的调查和检查，更没有对现场进行过具体的帮助，直到工地发生了问题，使用单位提出了意见前，我们还一无所知。
    由于领导上的官僚主义，所以也就不能即时纠正工地负责干部和推广先进经验小组组长的不正确的思想和作风。工地的组长保守思想很严重，对推广先进经验持消极态度，同时，对这一工地的工程也不够重视，因而对推广工作完全放弃领导。工地的两个监工员对推广先进经验工作也不重视，甚至对先进经验持怀疑态度，发生了问题后，还认为是“快了就好不了”。派到工地去的推广小组的小组长，对自己的任务也缺乏正确的认识，到了工地就想当监工员。加上工地组长对推广工作放弃领导，这个小组长不久就脱离了生产。于是，推广工作就只剩下推广小组的几个还不能完全掌握新砌砖法的瓦工在那里搞，完全陷于无人负责的自流状态。在这种情况下，推广工作怎么能不发生问题呢！
    接受了这次失败的教训，我们深深认识到领导方面的官僚主义作风是推广先进经验的最大的障碍。只布置动员，不进行深入的调查研究，不进行具体的思想教育和组织工作，不进行经常的检查督促和帮助，先进经验是不可能顺利推广的。我们今后将努力克服领导方面的官僚主义作风，以严肃认真的态度有组织有计划地进行推广先进经验工作。
