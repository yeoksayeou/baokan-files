    The Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives of Shanxi Province have been severely punished by the North China Administrative Council Trade Bureau and the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative through a public reprimand and fines for seriously violating contracts for the purchase of homespun cloth.
    At the North China Region Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition last autumn, the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives of Shanxi Province signed two contracts for the purchase of homespun cloth; the contracts stipulated that the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative would purchase 5.5 million square feet of homespun cloth from the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives from November of last year to March of this year.
    After the contracts were signed, the price of homespun cloth changed. At the end of November and the beginning of December last year, homespun cloth flowed out of Pingyuan Province, and the price rose, making it difficult to purchase cloth at the original reference price of 1,000 yuan per square foot; meanwhile, the price of homespun cloth in Shanxi Province fell, and purchasing at the Pingyuan Province price would result in losses. Later, although the price of homespun cloth in Pingyuan Province fell, the cadres of the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, due to their one-sided "benevolence" viewpoint, were unwilling to explain to the disaster victims and appropriately adjust the price of cloth purchase or delivery according to market conditions. The Changzhi Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative was also unwilling to accept the goods for fear of losing money. As a result, the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative adopted the method of "postponing delivery," and the Changzhi Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative adopted the method of "not accepting goods after the deadline," and both parties completely violated the contracts.
    In order to maintain the credibility of the contracts and solve the problem of material exchange between Pingyuan and Shanxi provinces, the Contract Inspection Committee of the Finance and Economics Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative persuaded the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in March of this year to determine the price of each square foot of homespun cloth at 1,020 yuan based on the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual concession and consideration for the production of disaster victims in Pingyuan, and partially revised the contract to resolve the dispute. However, the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, due to the trouble caused by their purely profit-seeking viewpoint, deliberately undermined the implementation of the original contract. The Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, because it was "afraid of losing money," only took away samples of the best-quality first-class cloth produced in Puyang (according to the contract, the homespun cloth to be delivered was divided into two types, Puyang-produced and Anyang-produced, each with first, second, and third-class cloth). When it went to accept the cloth according to the new contract, it only carried samples of the first-class Puyang-produced cloth, and even after the deadline, it only inspected and accepted 290,000 square feet of the first batch of 600,000 square feet, and did not accept the second batch of 600,000 square feet at all, and did not pay on time. The Changzhi Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, citing the reasons that the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative delivered the cloth three days late and the quantity was insufficient and the quality was too poor, only accepted 34.11 percent of the homespun cloth delivered by the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative during the inspection.
    The Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative should bear the main responsibility for the failure to deliver goods on time and the poor quality. Although Wang Zepu, the manager of the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, promised when revising the contract, "The cloth we collect is of very good quality, and the proportion of first-class and second-class cloth specified can be exceeded," he only made arrangements at each level after the meeting, but did not check it well, and blindly believed that there was no problem with the implementation of the contract, so that the one-sided "benevolence" viewpoint of cadres at all levels was not corrected in time, and the quality was not carefully controlled when collecting cloth, so that the goods could not be concentrated in time and the quality did not meet the requirements of the contract. For example, the contract stipulates that first-class cloth accounts for 30 percent, second-class cloth accounts for 45 percent, and third-class cloth accounts for 25 percent, but the homespun cloth collected only in the Liaocheng Special District, first-class cloth accounted for only 4 percent, and second-class cloth only accounted for 21.2 percent. However, on the side of the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives of Shanxi Province, the main reason for violating the contract was the purely profit-seeking viewpoint. They did not responsibly think about how seriously their actions would affect the supply of cloth to the members, the continuation of production by disaster victims, the turnover of funds, and the credit between the cooperatives! As a result, by June of this year, only one-sixth of the delivery volume of the original contract had been realized. In fact, at that time, the people of Shanxi Province still had to go to Pingyuan and Hebei provinces to buy cloth, while Pingyuan Province had a backlog of 30 million square feet of homespun cloth!
    In early June of this year, based on the fact that the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative caused losses to the Changzhi Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative due to overdue delivery and poor quality, the Trade Bureau of the North China Administrative Council and the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative ruled that the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative should compensate the Changzhi Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative 20,055,000 yuan. Also, based on the fact that the Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative caused losses to the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative due to its failure to accept goods within the time stipulated in the contract, its failure to inspect goods according to the stipulated types of cloth, and its intentional pickiness and refusal to accept goods, the authorities ruled that the Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative should compensate the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative 6.8 million yuan. On July 29, the Trade Bureau of the North China Administrative Council and the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative circulated this decision throughout the region, severely criticizing the serious errors of the Pingyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative for its bureaucratic work style and one-sided benevolence viewpoint, and the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives for their purely profit-seeking viewpoint and destruction of contract implementation.

    平原省及山西长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社
    严重破坏贸易合同分别受到处分
    平原省供销合作总社与山西省长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社，严重地破坏了土布代购合同，已受到华北行政委员会贸易局与华北供销合作总社通报批评及罚款的严格处分。
    在去年秋季华北区城乡物资交流展览大会上，平原省供销合作总社和山西省长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社签订了两件土布代购合同；合同规定平原省供销合作总社从去年十一月到今年三月代长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社收购五百五十万方尺土布。
    合同签订后，土布价格变化了。去年十一月底，十二月初平原省土布外流，价格上涨，因而按原来每方尺一千元的参考价格不好收布；而山西省的土布价格下落，按平原省价格收购就要赔钱。后来，平原省土布价格虽然下落，但平原省供销合作总社干部由于存在片面的“恩赐”观点，不肯向灾民解释，根据市场情况，适当调整收布或交布价格。长治专区供销合作总社也因“怕赔钱”而不肯收货。于是，平原省供销合作总社就采取了“缓期交货”，长治专区供销合作总社采取了“过期不收”的办法，双方把合同彻底破坏。
    中共中央华北局财经工作委员会合同检查委员会和华北供销合作总社为了维护合同的信用与解决平原、山西两省物资交流问题，在今年三月间说服平原省供销合作总社与长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社双方本互助互让和照顾平原灾民生产的精神，确定每方尺土布价格一千零二十元，并部分修订了合同以解决纠纷。但长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社因为单纯营利观点作怪，就蓄意破坏原合同的贯彻。榆次专区供销合作总社因为“怕赔钱”，就只拿走质量较好的濮阳产头等布样（按合同规定，所交土布分濮阳产与安阳产两种，每种都有头、二、三等布），到按新合同收布时，只拿着濮阳产头等布样，而且过了时间去把第一批六十万方尺验收了二十九万方尺，第二批六十万方尺却根本不收，并且不按期付款。长治专区供销合作总社，以平原省供销合作总社交布迟到三天和数量不足、质量太差的原因闹蹩扭，验收时只收了平原省供销合作总社运交土布的百分之三十四点一一。
    这次没有按时交货、质量太差，应由平原省供销合作总社负主要责任。平原省供销合作总社经理王泽普在修订合同时，虽曾应承说：“我们收的布质量很好，规定的头等布、二等布的比例，可以超过。”但开会后回去只是层层布置，却没有很好检查，盲目地认为合同的执行没有问题，使得各级干部的片面“恩赐”观点没有及时纠正，收布时没有认真掌握质量，以致到时货物不能及时集中，质量够不上合同的规定。例如：合同规定头等布百分之三十，二等布占百分之四十五，三等布占百分之二十五，但是只聊城专区收的土布，头等布就只占百分之四，二等布只占百分之二十一点二。但在山西省长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社方面，破坏合同的主要原因是单纯营利观点。他们没有负责地想想：他们这样做，将会怎样严重地影响社员布匹的供应、灾民生产的持续、资金的周转和社与社间的信用！结果，到今年六月为止，还只实现了原合同交货量的六分之一。实际上，当时山西省人民还得跑到平原、河北省去买布用，平原全省却积压了土布三千万方尺！
    华北行政委员会贸易局和华北供销合作总社在今年六月初根据平原省供销合作总社由于过期交货、质量太差，因而给长治专区供销合作总社造成损失的事实，裁决平原省供销合作总社给长治专区供销合作总社赔偿二千零五十万五千元，又根据榆次专区供销合作总社由于不按合同规定时间接货，不按规定布种验收，有意挑剔拒收，因而给平原省供销合作总社造成损失的事实，裁决榆次专区供销合作总社给平原省供销合作总社赔偿六百八十万元。华北行政委员会贸易局和华北供销合作总社并在七月二十九日将这一决定通报全区，严厉批评平原省供销合作总社由于存在官僚主义作风与片面恩赐观点，长治、榆次两专区供销合作总社由于存在单纯营利观点破坏合同贯彻的严重错误。    （新华社）
