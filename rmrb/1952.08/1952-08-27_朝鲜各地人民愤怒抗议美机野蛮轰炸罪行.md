    Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on August 23rd: "Pravda" reporter Dekachenko, in a dispatch from Pyongyang, reported on the mass meetings of the Korean people protesting against the recent atrocities of the invading army.
    Dekachenko wrote: "The Korean people's anger at the recent atrocities of the US imperialist aggressor army is difficult to describe in words. The appeal issued by the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Fatherland Front on August 20th in the Korean newspapers inspired the cities and villages of the Republic, the troops of the Korean People's Army, the troops of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the guerrilla columns in the South. Mass rallies were spontaneously held across the country. The patriotic people of Korea and the Chinese People's Volunteers expressed their firm belief that the enemy will never be able to destroy the fighting spirit and will of the Korean people to strive for victory, will never be able to force the suffering Korean people to accept barbaric armistice conditions, and will never be able to commit crimes with impunity."
    Dekachenko pointed out: "The appeal has won the warm support of all the Korean people. The residents of Pyongyang could not hold a city-wide conference on August 20th because the city was bombed by US aircraft. They held meetings in gorges, valleys, and mountains to support the appeal of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Fatherland Front."
    Dekachenko described a meeting held by residents in the northern part of Pyongyang, saying: "Speakers at the meeting included workers, artisans, teachers, postal and bank employees, pastors, and factory owners. Their social status, age, political and religious beliefs were different. Although they spoke differently, their thoughts, will, and emotions were consistent: to unite more closely under the banner of freedom and peace, to smash the barbarous plans of the interventionists, to safeguard the rights of the Korean people, and to save democracy."
    Dekachenko continued: "The radio station of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean Central News Agency have reported that the appeal of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Fatherland Front has won the support of all patriots. The working people in urban and rural areas, the soldiers of the Korean People's Army, and the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers are angrily protesting against the recent crimes of the US interventionist army, protesting against the man-hating plan to destroy seventy-eight cities in Korea."
    Dekachenko pointed out: "Meetings in support of the appeal of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Fatherland Front were also held in cities and villages in South Korea. The radio station of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea broadcasted reports of meetings held in Seoul, Busan, Incheon, Gwangju, and the Jirisan guerrilla zone. All the patriotic people of Korea support the appeal of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Fatherland Front and express their determination to fight to the end for the honor, freedom, and independence of the motherland, and to thwart the sinister plans of the interventionists."

    朝鲜各地人民愤怒抗议美机野蛮轰炸罪行
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：真理报记者德卡诚科在一篇发自平壤的通讯中，报道了朝鲜人民集会抗议侵略军最近暴行的情况。
    德卡诚科写道：朝鲜人民对美帝国主义侵略军最近暴行所表示的愤怒，是难于用文字形容的。朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会八月二十日在朝鲜各报发表的呼吁书，鼓舞了共和国的城市和乡村、人民军的部队、中国人民志愿军的部队和南部的游击队的纵队。全国各地自发地召开群众大会。朝鲜的爱国人民和中国人民志愿军表示他们的坚定的信心：敌人决摧毁不了朝鲜人民争取胜利的战斗精神和意志，绝不能强使苦难深重的朝鲜接受横蛮的停战条件，绝不能不受惩罚的犯罪。
    德卡诚科指出：呼吁书获得朝鲜全体人民的热烈拥护。平壤居民不能在八月二十日举行一个全城的大会，因为城市受到美机的轰炸。他们在山峡、山谷和群山里举行了拥护朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会的呼吁书的大会。
    德卡诚科描写了平壤北城的居民所举行的一次会议的情况，他说：在会上讲话的有工人、工匠、教员、邮局和银行职员、牧师和厂主。他们的社会地位、年龄、政治和宗教的信仰各不相同。他们说的话虽然不一样，他们的思想、意志和情绪却是一致的：在自由和平的旗帜下更紧密地团结起来，打垮干涉军的野蛮计划，维护朝鲜人民的权利，拯救民主。
    德卡诚科继续写道：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的电台以及朝鲜中央通讯社都报道说：朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会的呼吁书获得全体爱国人士的支持。城乡劳动人民、人民军和中国人民志愿军的战士愤怒抗议美国干涉军最近的罪行，抗议毁灭朝鲜七十八个城市的仇恨人类的计划。
    德卡诚科指出：南朝鲜的城市和乡村也举行了拥护朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会的呼吁书的大会。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的电台广播了汉城、釜山、仁川、光州、以及智异山游击区举行会议的情况。朝鲜的全体爱国人民都拥护朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会的呼吁书，并表示决心为祖国的荣誉、自由和独立战斗到底，挫败干涉军的罪恶计划。
