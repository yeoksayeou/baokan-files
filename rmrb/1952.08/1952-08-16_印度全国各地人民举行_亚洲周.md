    Several thousand people attended the public gathering for "Asia Week" held in Calcutta. The West Bengal Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of India called on the Indian people to strive for the success of "Asia Week" by conducting door-to-door propaganda, holding group meetings, and organizing public gatherings and parades. Mass organizations such as the West Bengal Branch of the All-India Trade Union Congress, the West Bengal Branch of the All-India Farmers' Association, and the West Bengal Women's Self-Defense League also called on their members and the people to fully support and participate in "Asia Week" to prepare for the upcoming Peace Conference for the Asian and Pacific Regions.

The resolution endorsed the holding of the Peace Conference for the Asian and Pacific Regions in Beijing to discuss ways to end wars in Asia.

    On August 8th, the Manikhtala district of Calcutta established a district peace committee, which included fifty prominent local figures.

The meeting broadcast recordings of confessions from American air force prisoners of war who had participated in American germ warfare. Professor Kosambi, Vice Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, who chaired the meeting, said: The Chinese people are living a very peaceful and happy life. The founders of New China have changed people's character. The Chinese people have only one request, which is to let them create their own future in peace and stability. Dr. Anand, Vice Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, said that the purpose of the Pacific Pact is to tighten the chains of enslavement around the necks of Asians. Peace worker Mrs. Mehta said that the All-India Peace Council has received many reports indicating that people across India are enthusiastically participating in "Asia Week."
