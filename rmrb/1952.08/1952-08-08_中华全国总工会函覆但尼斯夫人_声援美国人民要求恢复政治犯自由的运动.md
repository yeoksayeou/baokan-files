    Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently received a letter from Mrs. Dennis, the wife of the General Secretary of the American Communist Party, calling for support for the movement of the American National Conference to Save Victims of the Smith Act to fight for the release of the unreasonably arrested leaders of the American Communist Party and other political victims. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions replied to Mrs. Dennis on August 6th. The full text of the letter is as follows:
    Dear Friend Mrs. Dennis,
    We have read your letter and appeal of June 2nd and, on behalf of the Chinese working class, firmly support you and the American National Conference to Save Victims of the Smith Act's movement to demand the restoration of freedom to American political prisoners.
    The American ruling class's sentencing and imprisonment of Dennis and eleven other leaders of the American working class is aimed at suppressing the vanguard of the American working class—the American Communist Party,打击striking at the American labor movement, strengthening discrimination against black people, and stifling the growing American peace movement. This reactionary measure by the American government does not prove its strength, but rather illustrates its weakness, because it fears the power of the people, so it openly adopts Hitler's fascist rule methods. This despicable action shows that the American government is anti-American people, and it is the common enemy of peace-loving and democratic people all over the world.
    The American government is trying to promote its war policy aimed at seeking greater profits for Wall Street, so on the one hand, it is launching a war of aggression in Korea, delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, and inhumanly conducting germ warfare in Korea and China, using the pretext of "voluntary repatriation" to refuse to repatriate Chinese and Korean prisoners of war in a conspiracy to expand the war. On the other hand, it is suppressing the people's movement for peace and democracy at home, persecuting the leaders of the American Communist Party and other democrats. However, these atrocities at home and abroad will only arouse the will of peace-loving people all over the world to more resolutely defend peace and democracy. We believe that with the unity of the American working people and the support of the people of the world, the American people's democratic and free rights can be saved. We wish you and other American friends final victory in the movement to rescue Dennis, the loyal son of the American people, and other victims.
    With fraternal greetings,
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    August 6, 1952

    中华全国总工会函覆但尼斯夫人
    声援美国人民要求恢复政治犯自由的运动
    【新华社七日讯】中华全国总工会最近收到美国共产党总书记但尼斯的夫人的来信，呼吁声援美国拯救史密斯法受难者全国会议为争取释放被无理逮捕的美共领袖及其他政治受难者的运动。中华全国总工会于八月六日函复但尼斯夫人，该信全文如下：但尼斯夫人亲爱的朋友：
    我们读到了你六月二日的信和呼吁书，谨代表中国工人阶级坚决支援你和美国拯救史密斯法受难者全国会议要求恢复美国政治犯自由的运动。
    美国统治阶级对于但尼斯等十一位美国工人阶级领袖的判决与监禁，旨在镇压美国工人阶级的先锋队——美国共产党，打击美国的工人运动，加强对黑种人民的歧视并窒息在生长中的美国和平运动。美国政府这种反动的措施不是证明它强大，而是说明它的脆弱，因为它惧怕人民的力量，所以公开采取了希特勒的法西斯统治手段，这种卑鄙行动说明美国政府是反美国人民的，它也就是全世界爱好和平与民主的人民的共同敌人。
    美国政府企图推行它旨在为华尔街牟取更大利润的战争政策，所以一方面在国外发动侵朝战争，拖延朝鲜停战谈判，并绝灭人性地在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战，藉口“自愿遣返”，拒绝遣返中朝战俘以阴谋扩大战争。另一方面在国内镇压人民要求和平民主的运动，迫害美共领袖及其他民主分子。但是它在国内外的这些暴行，只有引起全世界爱好和平的人民更坚决地保卫和平民主的意志。我们相信在美国劳动人民团结一致与全世界人民的支持下，美国人民的民主自由权利是可以拯救的。祝你和其他美国朋友们在营救美国人民忠实的儿子但尼斯及其他受害者的运动中取得最后的胜利。
    致以兄弟的敬礼。
    中华全国总工会
    一九五二年八月六日
