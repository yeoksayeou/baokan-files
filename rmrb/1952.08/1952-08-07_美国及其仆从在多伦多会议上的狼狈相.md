Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 6th: Our special correspondent reports: The final meeting of the General Committee of the International Red Cross Conference concluded on the afternoon of the 2nd. From the meetings of the General Committee, one can conclude that those in control of the meeting tried every possible means to obscure the truth and undermine humanitarian principles. However, they not only failed to achieve their intended goal, but also further exposed their true colors before the people of the world.

    The discussions in the General Committee meetings in recent days have focused on three proposals. These three proposals are: China's proposal to stop the atrocities of the American invading army in Korea that severely violate the Geneva Conventions in order to maintain the dignity of the conventions; the Soviet Union's proposal to ban the use of atomic bombs; and Poland's proposal to ratify and abide by the Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons. These proposals expressed a sincere desire to work together to study the problems of all countries, especially those affected by war, and are truly plans to alleviate human suffering. Therefore, these proposals fully embody the spirit of true humanitarianism.

    In sharp contrast to these proposals, Chairman François-Poncet painstakingly prevented the meeting from seriously discussing the above proposals; at the same time, the American delegation and its lackeys insisted that the delegations of China, North Korea, the Soviet Union, and other democratic countries were "inserting political issues," using this so-called "no discussion of political issues" as a cowardly pretext to distort or reject the proposals put forward by China, the Soviet Union, and Poland to safeguard humanitarian principles.

    The reporter has never seen anyone use the phrase "no discussion of political issues" so shamelessly as a shelter to hide their embarrassment in the face of truth and true humanitarianism, because their relationship with truth and true humanitarianism is like the North and South Poles. Everyone saw when Mr. François-Poncet, who claimed to be "impartial," was eager to heavily bang his gavel. The head of the Soviet Red Cross delegation, Slavin, sarcastically said: "Mr. Chairman, I am very grateful to you, because you have never forgotten to remind me and the representatives of other democratic countries that we can only say a few words."

    Once, Nicholson, the chief representative of the American Red Cross delegation, went on stage to explain that he had enthusiastically applauded some words of a speaker, but later suddenly realized that he had clapped for the wrong thing. He looked ashamed when he explained, which was indeed a comical scene. People could see that when the representative of the North Korean Red Cross accused the United States of wantonly violating the Geneva Conventions, the chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Ruegger (who was originally anxiously discussing with Marshall, the chief observer from the American government attending the conference and a member of the U.S. State Department's Policy Planning Staff), and his delegation hurriedly walked out of the venue with the South Korean puppet representative from New York to discuss strategy. People can also see the following absurd facts: some delegations, on the pretext of technical errors, attempted to shamelessly cancel the Polish proposal passed at the previous meeting of the General Committee; the United Kingdom and other delegations trembled in the face of the truth and humanitarianism expressed in the Soviet Union's proposal to ban atomic bombs, and they advocated amending the proposal with "international control of atomic energy, etc." in order to invisibly cancel the proposal; as previously reported, the Chinese proposal was rejected in a hasty vote. In order to prevent the Chinese and North Korean delegations from raising objections and accusations, the Belgian, Australian, and British delegations proposed that "investigations" be conducted and "whether the facts raised in the proposal of the delegation of the People's Republic of China are correct" be "determined."

    At the General Committee meetings and several meetings of the Legal Subcommittee, the Chinese delegation exposed this trick of distorting the truth and facts. As Su Jingguan, the chief representative of the Chinese government, said at the General Committee meeting on July 31: "When I made these accusations, I said that we carry with us films, recordings, photos, and letters from prisoners of war as evidence to prove that these accusations are all facts, and we have requested more than once to exhibit these evidences at the conference. However, the conference has so far ignored our request. I believe that the conference is not afraid of the truth. I must solemnly point out again that the Chinese delegation requests an opportunity to exhibit these evidences. If the conference does not do so, I doubt whether there is any reliable basis for those accusations that what we have said here is political in nature." The final answer of those in control of the conference to China's request was a flat "no." They also did not provide any technical assistance when the Chinese delegation held its own exhibition.

    After all kinds of tricks had failed, the manipulators of the conference used the last resort of Western diplomacy, allowing the Belgian, Australian, and British delegations to jointly submit the following proposal at the last meeting of the General Committee on the 2nd: "In view of the fact that Article 7 of the International Red Cross Statute specifically stipulates that the International Committee of the Red Cross is responsible for handling complaints concerning so-called violations of humanitarian conventions... It is hereby invited that: (A) the relevant governments agree to conduct investigations on a mutually agreed basis; (B) the national Red Cross societies cooperate to achieve this goal." The intention of this proposal is obviously to dispatch the American tool—the International Committee of the Red Cross—to carry out unspeakable evil deeds.

    The Chinese delegation issued a statement on this proposal, saying that the conference unjustly set aside China's proposal to condemn the United States for violating the Geneva Conventions, and deliberately ignored the evidence presented by China. Now to talk about "investigation" is simply extremely unreasonable. Later, France and other countries suggested deleting several paragraphs concerning the International Committee of the Red Cross from the Belgian, Australian, and British draft, which is tantamount to acknowledging the notoriety of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Chinese delegation solemnly stated its position before the vote. During the vote, the delegations of China, the Soviet Union, and other people's democratic countries abstained. The joint proposal of the three countries was actually passed at the meeting. When this joint proposal is submitted to the plenary session next week, the Chinese delegation will raise this issue again, just as the Soviet and Polish delegations have reserved the right to raise the original proposals at the plenary session.

    The last vote on the afternoon of the 2nd was on the Brazilian proposal. The purpose of this proposal was to blatantly change the basic principles, statutes, and rules of the International Red Cross in order to give the remnant Kuomintang bandits the legal right to attend the meeting. But this proposal was rejected, because it seemed that the manipulators of the conference were somewhat hesitant, and they also felt that at this extremely embarrassing moment, it was not worth it to make themselves too bad on this issue for the small group of Kuomintang elements in Taiwan. The representatives of the remnant Kuomintang bandits withdrew from the meeting on July 31. Here, the withdrawal of the Kuomintang clowns from the meeting was as unnoticed as the flight of a few filthy flies.

### 美国及其仆从在多伦多会议上的狼狈相

    美国及其仆从在多伦多会议上的狼狈相
    【新华社多伦多六日电】本社特派记者报道：国际红十字大会总务委员会的最后一次会议已于二日下午结束。从总务委员会的会议中可以得出一个结论，就是把持会议的人曾想尽千方百计来蒙蔽真相和破坏人道原则，可是，他们不但没有达到预期的目的，反而在全世界人民面前进一步暴露了他们的面目。
    总务委员会会议最近几天的讨论，集中在三个提案上。这三个提案是：中国所提的关于制止侵朝美军严重破坏日内瓦公约的暴行以维护公约尊严的提案；苏联所提的关于禁止使用原子弹的提案；波兰所提的关于批准和遵守禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的提案。这些提案表现了协力研究一切国家的问题、特别是受战争之害的国家的问题的诚挚愿望，并且真正是解除人类痛苦的计划。因此，这些提案充分体现了真正人道主义的精神。
    与这些提案适成尖锐对比的是：主席法朗索阿—庞赛处心积虑不让会议认真讨论上述提案；同时，美国代表团及其仆从一味声称中国、朝鲜、苏联以及其他民主国家的代表团“插入政治问题”，用这个所谓“不谈政治问题”的幌子，卑怯地歪曲或否决了中国、苏联、波兰所提出的维护人道主义原则的提案。
    记者从来没有见过有人这样无耻地使用“不谈政治问题”这句话作为庇护所，以掩饰他们在真理和真正的人道主义面前的狼狈情景，因为他们与真理和真正的人道主义的关系，犹如南北两极。每个人都看到自命“公正”的法朗索阿—庞赛先生在什么时候急于要重重地敲他的小椎。苏联红十字会代表团团长司拉文讽刺得好：“主席先生，我很感谢你，因为你从来没有忘记提醒我以及其他民主国家的代表只能说一些些的话。”
    有一次，美国红十字会代表团首席代表尼科逊上台发言，只是为了要解释这样一点：他对一个发言者的一些话热烈鼓掌，后来却忽然发现他拍错了手。他在解释时脸有惭色，这的确是一个滑稽场面。人们可以看到，当朝鲜红十字会代表指责美国恣意破坏日内瓦公约时，红十字国际委员会主席吕格（原来在和美国政府出席大会的首席观察员、美国国务院政策室人员马舍尔不安地商谈），与他的代表团这时便匆匆地与从纽约来的南朝鲜傀儡代表走出会场去商谈战略。人们也可以看到以下这些荒唐的事实：有些代表团藉口技术上的错误，企图无耻地取消在总务委员会前次会议上通过的波兰提案；英国和其他代表团在苏联提出的禁止原子弹的提案所表现的真理和人道主义面前发抖，他们主张以“国际管制原子能等等”办法来修正这个提案，以便无形中取消这个提案；前已报道，中国的提案在匆促的表决中被否决了。为了防止中国和朝鲜代表团提出不满的意见和指责，比利时、澳大利亚和英国代表团提出提案，主张“调查”并“确定中华人民共和国代表团提案中所提出的事实是否正确”。
    在总务委员会会议和法律小组委员会的几次会议上，中国代表团都揭露了这种歪曲真理和事实的诡计。如中国政府首席代表苏井观在七月三十一日的总务委员会会议上所说的：“我在提出这些指责时说过，我们随身带有影片、录音、照片和战俘信件等证物足以证明这些指责都是事实，我们曾不止一次地要求把这些证物在大会上展览。但是，大会迄今一直不曾理会我们的要求。我相信大会不会害怕真理。我必须再郑重地指出，中国代表团要求一个展览这些证物的机会。如果大会不这样做，我怀疑那些说我们在这里发表的谈话是政治性质的指责有什么可靠的根据。”把持大会的人们对于中国的要求的最后答覆是一个干脆的“不”字。中国代表团自己举行展览，他们也没有给以任何技术上的帮助。
    在各种各样的诡计都遭到失败以后，会议的操纵者用出了西方外交的最后一套手段，让比利时、澳大利亚和英国代表团在二日总务委员会最后一次会议上联名提出下面一项提案：“鉴于国际红十字章程第七条特别规定红十字国际委员会负责处理有关所谓违犯人道主义公约的控诉……兹邀请：（甲）有关政府同意在共同商定的基础上进行调查；（乙）各国红十字会协力相助以达到这个目的。”这个提案的用意显然在于派遣美国御用工具——红十字国际委员会去进行不可告人的罪恶勾当。
    中国代表团就此提案发表声明说：会议不公正地撇开了中国谴责美国违反日内瓦公约的提案，并且故意地忽视中国所提出的证据，现在却来谈“调查”，这简直是横蛮无理之至。后来法国及其他国家建议在比、澳、英三国草案中删去关于红十字国际委员会的几段，这就无异承认红十字国际委员会的恶名劣迹。中国代表团在表决前严正地表明了自己的立场。表决时，中国、苏联和其他人民民主国家的代表团都弃权。三国联合提案竟在会议上通过。在这个联合提案提交下周的全体大会时，中国代表团将再度提出这个问题，就像苏联和波兰代表团都保留了在全体大会上提出原提案的权利一样。
    二日下午最后表决的是巴西的提案。这个提案的目的是要明目张胆地改变国际红十字的基本原则、章程和细则，以便使国民党残余匪帮有合法的权利出席会议。但是这个提案被否决了，因为看来会议的操纵者有些犹豫，他们也觉得在这个极为窘迫的时候，犯不着在这个问题上为台湾那一小撮国民党分子把自己搞得太糟。国民党残余匪帮的代表在七月三十一日退出了会议。在这里，国民党小丑的退出会议，就像几只龌龊苍蝇的飞开一样，毫不为人注意。
