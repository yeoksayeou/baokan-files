To the People's Supervision Committees of all major administrative regions, provinces, and cities:

Regarding the bureaucratic errors of relevant agencies and personnel in the provinces of Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Chahar in the case of Zhang Shunyou, a carter worker in Shanxi Province, reporting counter-revolutionary elements, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has exposed and dealt with them. The People's Supervision Committees of Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Chahar provinces have also given appropriate administrative punishments to the relevant agencies and personnel involved in the incident.

Relevant materials regarding the "Zhang Shunyou Incident" have been published in the People's Daily. This incident shows that these agencies and personnel have serious bureaucracy, lack a mass viewpoint, have a vague stance, and cannot distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. This is manifested in: a lack of concern and sympathy for the people's immediate suffering and just demands, and a lack of hatred for counter-revolutionary elements. They did not understand that Zhang Shunyou's personal interests were consistent with the interests of the state and the people in reporting counter-revolutionary elements, and therefore did not welcome, support, or encourage him. They mistakenly adopted an attitude of targeting the person instead of the matter, believing that Zhang Shunyou's "motives were impure" and that he was acting out of "personal interest." Thus, they adopted a perfunctory, procrastinating, dismissive, and irresponsible bureaucratic attitude toward Zhang Shunyou's report. Some agencies and personnel even handcuffed and detained Zhang Shunyou, adopting a suppressive attitude towards the whistleblower, which was an even more serious error. It also shows that these agencies and personnel are careless in their work and lack a system for receiving the people and handling people's complaints. Responsible cadres are aloof and do not understand the situation; lower-level cadres do not report or ask for instructions, and there is no organization or discipline.

Receiving the people and handling their complaints is an important task. People's Supervision Committees at all levels must earnestly implement the "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. By receiving the people and handling their complaints, we will inspire the broad masses of the people to actively supervise government agencies and personnel, educate cadres, correct shortcomings in our work, and strengthen the ties between the government and the people. If we fail to correctly treat the work of receiving the people and handling their complaints, we will become divorced from the masses. Currently, in receiving the people and handling their complaints, many places have situations similar to the "Zhang Shunyou Incident," which are causing dissatisfaction among the people. Therefore, supervisory organs and their staff at all levels must study the "Zhang Shunyou Incident," learn from the lessons of the "Zhang Shunyou Incident," and overcome and prevent bureaucracy and erroneous thinking in receiving the people and handling their complaints. Through this study, conduct a serious inspection of the work of receiving the people and handling their complaints. Check whether there is an irresponsible bureaucratic style of pushing things out the door, transferring cases layer by layer without handling them, perfunctory responses, and other similar situations. Check for unfair handling, retaliation, and other errors. Check whether our attitude in receiving the people and handling their complaints is realistic, conscientious, and responsible in resolving problems, and whether reporting and summarizing are timely, and whether a clear and responsible explanation is given to the complainant for the handling of each case. Furthermore, during the inspection, it is necessary to promptly study, inspect, and handle cases that have not yet been investigated and resolved, as well as backlogged cases.

After studying the "Zhang Shunyou Incident" and inspecting the work of receiving the people and handling their complaints, the People's Supervision Committees at all levels must make a summary and report it level by level to the People's Supervision Committee of the Central People's Government.

### 中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会  关于接受张顺有事件的教训、检查接见人民和处理人民控告的通知

    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会
    关于接受张顺有事件的教训、检查接见人民和处理人民控告的通知各大行政区及省、市人民监察委员会：
    在山西省赶车工人张顺有检举反革命分子的事件中，山西、绥远、察哈尔三省有关机关和人员的官僚主义错误，中共中央华北局已进行了揭发和处理。山西、绥远、察哈尔三省人民监察委员会亦对该事件中的有关机关和人员给予了适当的行政处分。
    “张顺有事件”的有关材料均已登载于人民日报。这一事件说明，这些机关和人员有严重官僚主义，缺乏群众观点，立场模糊，敌我不分，表现在：对群众的切身痛苦和正义要求不关心、不同情，对反革命分子不仇恨。不懂得张顺有在检举反革命分子这件事上，其个人利害和国家人民的利害是一致的，因而未予欢迎、支持和鼓励，错误地采取对人不对事的态度，认为张顺有“动机不纯”，为“个人利益”出发，于是对待张顺有的检举采取敷衍拖延，拒绝不管，不负责任的官僚主义态度。甚至有的机关和人员给张顺有带上手铐，加以扣押，对检举者采取打击的态度，错误更为严重。同时也说明这些机关和人员，在工作上粗枝大叶，缺乏接见人民与处理人民控告的制度。负责干部高高在上，不了解情况；下面干部则不报告，不请示，无组织无纪律。
    接见人民和处理人民的控告是一件重要的工作。各级人民监察委员会必须认真地执行中央人民政府政务院“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”。通过接见人民和处理人民控告，会启发广大人民群众积极地监督政府机关和工作人员，教育干部，纠正我们工作中的缺点，密切政府与人民的联系。如果不能正确地对待接见人民工作和处理人民控告，我们便会脱离人民群众。目前，在接见人民和处理人民控告上，许多地方存在着类似“张顺有事件”的情形，为人民群众所不满。因此，各级监察机关及其工作人员要学习“张顺有事件”，接受“张顺有事件”的教训，克服和防止在接见人民和处理人民控告上的官僚主义和错误思想。通过这个学习，把接见人民和处理人民控告的工作认真地进行一次检查。检查在接见人民和处理人民控告上，是否存在推出门不管，层层转办，层层不办，敷衍应付等不负责任的官僚主义作风和处理不公，打击报复等错误的情形。检查我们接见人民和处理人民控告的态度，是否实事求是，认真负责地解决问题，报告、总结是否及时，每一案件的处理是否都向控告人做了清楚负责的交代。并且在检查中，要对尚未查清与处理的案件及积压的案件，迅速地进行研究、检查与处理。
    各级人民监察委员会在进行“张顺有事件”的学习，并检查了接见人民与处理人民控告的工作之后，须要做出总结，逐级上报中央人民监察委员会。
    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会
    一九五二年八月二十五日
