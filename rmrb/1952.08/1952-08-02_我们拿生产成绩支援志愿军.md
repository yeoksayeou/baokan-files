    We Support the Volunteer Army with Production Achievements
    To all commanders and combatants of the Volunteer Army: On the great 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, the greatest gift we, the farmers of Xigou Village, want to give you is the achievements we have made on the production front.
    In early April this year, the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative launched a comprehensive production increase competition to national labor models and fellow farmers. So far, we have overfulfilled the spring and summer production plans. In the spring drought prevention and resistance campaign, our cooperative accumulated snow to conserve moisture on 240 mu, repaired three canals, and dug ten water storage ponds. In terms of fertilization, each mu was applied with 116 dan of base fertilizer (exceeding the original plan by 6 dan), and each mu of the 10 mu of high-yield land was applied with 180 dan of base fertilizer (exceeding the original plan by 50 dan). Seventy percent of the land was deep ploughed with a single-blade plow, and seed dressing with pesticides was also carried out. In order to ensure increased yields, 200 retaining walls were built, 20 mu of soil was improved, and five and a half mu of beach land was reclaimed.
    Secondly, we have also developed agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. This year, a total of 2,752 trees were planted (more than double the original plan), and one head each of new breeding stock and draught cattle, ten pigs, and 471 sheep were purchased.
    Significant achievements have also been made in providing preferential treatment to military families. Five of the eight military families in the village have joined agricultural cooperatives. In order to increase the yield of land belonging to military families (increasing the yield by 40 jin per mu, 5 jin more than the masses), each mu of land was applied with 110 dan of manure (10 dan more than the masses) and tilled three times. In addition, 65 retaining walls were built for military families, 20 more than the original plan. Before July 23rd, all autumn crops of the eight military families had been weeded twice, and 60 percent of the land had been top-dressed with fertilizer. The eight military families also actively participated in the production increase competition, and Wang Buqiao and Shen Jilan were elected as spring patriotic production models. Shen Jilan was also elected as a military family model and deputy director of the agricultural, forestry and animal husbandry production cooperative.
    In early June this year, we also drafted a three-year construction plan for Xigou Village. This plan is: (1) to concentrate efforts to generally increase unit area yield, reclaim 120 mu of beach land, and increase grain production by 45 percent; (2) to appropriately delineate forest areas and develop 1,000 mu of forest slopes within three years, planting 17,700 trees; (3) to vigorously develop animal husbandry, increasing breeding stock by two head, breeding 42 head of livestock and 900 sheep within three years, and raising 100 pigs, with an average of three chickens per person. After the completion of the above plan, the total income will exceed last year's by 134.9 percent.
    Comrades, your victory guarantees our victory, and our victory strongly supports you. Let us stand on different fronts and fight to the end for a common goal!
    All members of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, all members of mutual aid teams, and all villagers of Xigou Village, Ping Shun, Shanxi

    我们拿生产成绩支援志愿军
    志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：在伟大的“八一”建军节二十五周年的时候，我们西沟村农民要送给你们的最大礼物，就是我们在生产战线上已经取得的成绩。
    今年四月初，李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社向全国劳动模范、农民兄弟提出了全面增产竞赛。到现在为止，我们已超额完成了春夏两季的生产计划。在春季防旱抗旱运动中，我们合作社积雪保墒二百四十亩、修渠三条、掘蓄水池十个。在施肥方面，每亩上底粪一百一十六担（超过原来计划六担）、十亩丰产地每亩上底粪一百八十担（超过原来计划五十担）。百分之七十的土地是用单把犁深耕的，还做到用药剂拌种。为了保证提高产量，还修筑塌岸二百道，改良土壤二十亩，并兴修了五亩半滩地。
    其次，我们还发展了农林畜牧事业。今年共植树二千七百五十二株（超过原来计划一倍多），新买种畜、耕牛各一头、猪十口、羊四百七十一只。
    优待军属工作也获得了许多成绩。全村八户军属，有五户加入了农业合作社。为了提高军属的土地的产量（每亩增产四十斤，比群众多五斤），每亩地都上了一百一十担粪（比群众多十担）、耕做三遍。另外，还为军属修筑了塌岸六十五道，比原来的计划多修了二十道。七月二十三日前，八户军属的秋庄稼全已锄过两遍，百分之六十的土地上了追肥。八户军属也积极参加了增产竞赛运动，王补巧、申记兰还当选了春季爱国生产模范，申记兰又被选为军属模范和农林畜牧生产合作社副社长。
    今年六月初，我们还拟订了西沟村的三年建设计划。这计划是：（一）集中力量普遍提高单位面积产量，兴修滩地一百二十亩，增产粮食百分之四十五；（二）适当划分林区，三年内发展林坡一千亩，植树一万七千七百株；（三）大力发展畜牧事业，三年内增加种畜两头，繁殖牲口四十二头、羊九百只，养猪一百口，每人平均养鸡三只。以上计划完成后，其总收入将超过去年的百分之一百三十四点九。
    同志们，你们的胜利保证了我们的胜利，而我们的胜利也有力地支援着你们。让我们站在不同的战线上为着共同的目的而奋斗到底吧！
    山西平顺西沟村李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社全体社员、互助组全体组员和全村群众
