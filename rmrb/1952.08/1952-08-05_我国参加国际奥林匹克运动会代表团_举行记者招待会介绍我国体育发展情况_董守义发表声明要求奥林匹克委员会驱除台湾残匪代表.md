Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 4th: (Delayed) The Chinese sports delegation participating in the 15th International Olympic Games held a press conference here on July 31st. Rong Gaotang, head of the delegation, and Dong Shouyi, chief advisor and member of the International Olympic Committee, issued statements at the press conference.

	In his statement, Rong Gaotang emphasized the regrettable fact that the Chinese delegation could not participate in the Olympic Games in time for the competition due to various unreasonable obstructions and delayed invitations. Rong Gaotang said: However, the delegation has arrived after all, bringing with it the friendly feelings of the Chinese people and Chinese athletes towards the people and athletes of Finland and other countries, as well as a sincere desire to promote contacts and exchange of sports activities between countries.

	Rong Gaotang then introduced the sports situation in New China, saying: Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, sports activities have developed unprecedentedly due to the development of economic and cultural construction and the improvement of people's living standards.

	The All-China Athletic Federation was reorganized into the All-China Sports Federation, becoming the leading organization for all sports activities in the country. After the reorganization, 370 sports organizations have been established in administrative regions above the county level. At the same time, sports activities have been launched among the broad masses of workers. For example, in the first half of 1951, the number of people participating in sports activities in Shenyang was six and a half times more than in the past. Railway workers alone organized 3,200 basketball teams in 1951. Millions of people participated in broadcast calisthenics. The South China volleyball team, with worker and peasant athletes as its core, won the 1951 national volleyball championship, which shows the achievements of sports activities. Although the Chinese government has huge construction tasks to carry out, it still allocates a large amount of funds to promote popular sports. In this way, in the short three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's new sports activities have shown new vitality. Chinese sports workers are following Chairman Mao's instructions to promote sports and strengthen the people's physique, and are now working hard to improve the people's sports level. They are willing to strengthen international sports activities together with athletes and sports workers from other countries. Rong Gaotang finally thanked the people of Helsinki for their friendly reception on behalf of the Chinese sports delegation.

	Dong Shouyi delivered a personal statement after Rong Gaotang. The only legitimate Chinese member of the International Olympic Committee said in his statement: I deeply regret that the International Olympic Committee has always refused to recognize the All-China Sports Federation - that is, the Chinese Olympic Committee. The All-China Sports Federation is the legitimate and only Chinese national sports organization, both in fact and in accordance with the Olympic Charter. In addition, inviting the Chinese Kuomintang sports organization in Taiwan to participate at the same time is a violation of the Olympic Charter. Dong Shouyi pointed out: The Taiwan Kuomintang clique has long been spurned by the Chinese people and all upright people in the world, and cannot represent the Chinese people at all, and should not be allowed to use the name of the Chinese Olympic Committee to carry out activities.

	Dong Shouyi severely criticized the shameless role played by Hao Gengsheng, the representative of the Kuomintang. Hao Gengsheng shamelessly claimed to be the "Acting Chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee," spreading slanderous lies, insisting that Dong Shouyi, who had arrived here a few days ago with the Chinese sports delegation as a free and healthy member of the International Olympic Committee, had died in a "concentration camp." Dong Shouyi reiterated the statement in his telegram to the former President of the International Olympic Committee, that among the three Chinese members of the International Olympic Committee, only he is qualified to be a representative of the Chinese Olympic Committee, because he is the only one who performs his duties as a member of the International Olympic Committee and the only Chinese representative who carries out his activities as a member of the All-China Sports Federation - that is, the Chinese Olympic Committee, while the other two - Kong Xiangxi and Wang Zhengting have long been spurned by the Chinese people. According to Article 11 of the Olympic Charter, they should be immediately deprived of their qualifications as members of the International Olympic Committee, because they are completely unable to perform their duties and are not qualified to carry out activities as representatives of the Chinese Olympic Committee at all. Dong Shouyi emphasized: In order to maintain the dignity and integrity of the Olympic Charter, and to maintain the honor of the International Olympic Committee, the International Olympic Committee should immediately recognize the All-China Sports Federation and expel the Kuomintang organization in Taiwan from the Olympic Committee and relevant international federations.

	Dong Shouyi concluded: I am confident that the friendship between the Chinese people, Chinese athletes and sports workers and the people, athletes and sports workers of all other countries, and the exchange of experience in sports will be enhanced and developed.

    我国参加国际奥林匹克运动会代表团
    举行记者招待会介绍我国体育发展情况
    董守义发表声明要求奥林匹克委员会驱除台湾残匪代表
    【新华社赫尔辛基四日电】（迟到）参加第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的中国体育代表团于七月三十一日在此间举行记者招待会，代表团团长荣高棠和总指导、国际奥林匹克委员会委员董守义在招待会上发表了声明。
    荣高棠在声明中着重指出令人遗憾的事实，即：由于种种不合理的阻挠和迟发邀请而造成的延搁，中国代表团不能及时参加奥林匹克运动会比赛。荣高棠说：但是代表团毕竟来了，而且带来了中国人民和中国运动员对芬兰及其他国家的人民和运动员的友好感情，以及促进各国联系和交流体育活动的真诚愿望。
    荣高棠接着介绍新中国的体育情况说：在中华人民共和国建国以来，由于经济和文化建设的发展以及人民生活水准的提高，体育活动已有了空前的发展。
    中华全国体育协进会改组成为中华全国体育总会，成为全国所有体育活动的领导机关。改组以后，县以上的行政区已组织了三百七十个体育组织。同时体育运动已在广大的劳动群众中展开。例如在一九五一年上半年，沈阳参加体育活动的人比过去多六倍半。仅仅铁路工人在一九五一年就组织了三千二百个篮球队。数百万人民参加了广播早操。以工农运动员为核心的华南排球队赢得了一九五一年全国排球赛锦标，由此可以看出体育活动的成就。中国政府虽有庞大的建设任务要进行，但仍拨出大量款项提倡人民体育运动。这样，在中华人民共和国建国后短短的三年中，中国的新体育活动已经显示了新的生命力。中国体育工作者遵循毛主席的提倡体育和锻炼人民体格的指示，现正在努力提高人民的体育水平。他们愿意和其他国家的运动员和体育工作者共同加强国际的体育活动。荣高棠最后代表中国体育代表团感谢赫尔辛基人民的友好接待。
    董守义继荣高棠之后发表个人声明。这位国际奥林匹克委员会中唯一合法的中国委员在声明中说：我对于国际奥林匹克委员会一直拒绝承认中华全国体育总会——即中国奥林匹克委员会——深表遗憾。中华全国体育总会无论在事实上或是依照奥林匹克章程，都是合法的和唯一的中国全国性体育组织。此外，同时邀请在台湾的中国国民党体育组织参加，是违反奥林匹克的章程的。董守义指出：台湾国民党集团早已被中国人民和全世界正直的人民所唾弃，绝不能代表中国人民，并且不应该允许它利用中国奥林匹克委员会的名义进行活动。
    董守义严厉指责国民党代表郝更生所饰演的厚颜可耻的角色。郝更生无耻地自称“中国奥林匹克委员会代理主席”，散布诬蔑的谎话，硬说几天前以国际奥林匹克委员会委员身份自由健壮地偕同中国体育代表团飞抵此间的董守义已死于“集中营”。董守义再度强调他致国际奥林匹克委员会前主席的电报中的声明，即国际奥林匹克委员会的三个中国委员中，只有他有资格是中国奥林匹克委员会的代表，因为他是唯一执行他作为国际奥林匹克委员会委员的职责而且唯一进行他作为中华全国体育总会——即中国奥林匹克委员会——的会员的活动的中国代表，而其他两个人——孔祥熙和王正廷早已被中国人民所唾弃，依照奥林匹克章程第十一条，他们应该立刻被剥夺国际奥林匹克委员会的委员资格，因为他们完全不能执行职责，而且根本没有资格作为中国奥林匹克委员会的代表进行活动。董守义强调说：为了维护奥林匹克章程的尊严和完整，为了维护国际奥林匹克委员会的荣誉，国际奥林匹克委员会应该立即承认中华全国体育总会，并将台湾国民党的组织从奥林匹克委员会和有关的国际联合会中驱逐出去。
    董守义最后说：我确信中国人民、中国运动员和体育工作者和其他一切国家的人民、运动员和体育工作者之间的友谊和在体育方面的经验交流，一定会获得增进和发展。
