    4. Mr. Zhou came to my house and told my parents not to worry about my tuition, and that I didn't need to buy books either. My parents agreed to let me go to school. But after only a little over a month of schooling, I was seen by the traitorous head of the Baojia system, Zhou Chang'an.
    5. Zhou Chang'an immediately ran to my house to demand tax money. He said, "You have money to send him to school, but no money to pay taxes? This is official business, and you must pay today! If you really don't have money, then tell Yubao to herd pigs for me, and I'll pay the tax for you."
    6. My parents had no choice but to send me to herd pigs for the tyrannical Baojia head, and I dropped out of school.

    四、周先生到我家里，对我父母说不要我的学费，书也用不着买。父母答应了我去读书。可是我才念了一个多月书，就被汉奸保长周长安看见了。
    五、周长安马上跑到我家要税钱。他说：“有钱供大学堂，没有钱纳税？这是公事，今天不给钱可不行！要是真没有钱，就叫玉宝给我放猪去，那税钱我替你缴上。”
    六、父母没有法子，就叫我给阎王保长去放猪，我就失学了。
