    Chongqing's private industry and commerce have rapidly recovered since June, and the sluggish situation that emerged since February this year has basically passed. The transaction volume of the city's twelve major markets in June increased by 24% compared with May, and the transaction volume of most industries is close to the level before the "Five-Anti" campaign. The transaction volume of medicinal materials, cloth, department stores, flue-cured tobacco, new medicines, and fruits has exceeded December of last year. The total transaction volume of eighteen major markets, including cotton cloth, grain, mountain products, and medicinal materials, in the first ten days of July increased by 27% compared with the first ten days of June. Now merchants from all over are flocking to Chongqing to purchase goods. The flow of local and special products from small and medium-sized towns to Chongqing is also increasing day by day.
    After the end of the "Five-Anti" movement in Chongqing in early June, the Municipal People's Government and the state-owned economy used great efforts to help private industry and commerce resume business. In June, more than 110 new factories and shops were added in the city, and the number of employees increased by more than 3,500. In the urban area alone, 353 private industrial and commercial enterprises increased their capital. More than 110 factories and businesses in six industries, including local product export, electrical equipment, soap, pigments, books and educational supplies, and cigarettes, have jointly organized material exchange mobile groups to purchase and sell materials in medium and small cities and towns in southern Sichuan, western Sichuan, northern Sichuan, and eastern Sichuan.

    重庆市私营工商业迅速恢复
    重庆市私营工商业六月份以来迅速恢复，今年二月以来出现的呆滞情况基本上已经过去。全市十二个主要市场六月份交易额比五月份增加百分之二十四，大部分行业交易量接近“五反”前水平。药材、布匹、百货、烟叶、新药、水果等业交易量已超过去年十二月。棉布、粮食、山货、药材等十八个主要市场，七月上旬总成交量比六月上旬增加百分之二十七。现在各地商贩纷纷到重庆进货。中小城镇土产、特产涌向重庆的也一天比一天增多。
    重庆市“五反”运动六月初结束后，市人民政府和国营经济以极大的力量帮助私营工商业恢复业务。六月份全市新增工厂、商店一百一十多家，职工增加三千五百多人。私营工商业增加资金的，仅城区就有三百五十三家，土产输出、电工器材、肥皂、颜料、图书教育用品、卷烟等六个行业中的一百一十多家厂、商，已联合组织物资交流流动小组，到川南、川西、川北、川东等中、小城、镇购销物资。（新华社）
