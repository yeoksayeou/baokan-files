    The China Textile Workers' Sanatorium, established by the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union on the coast of Qingdao, was officially established in mid-August. The first group of sanatorium members totals 282 people, including labor models, advanced workers, cadres newly promoted from workers, engineers, and technical personnel.

    The sanatorium is located on the coast east of Zhan Shan in Qingdao. This area is a resort suitable for recuperation, backing onto mountains and facing the sea, with beautiful scenery and a good climate. There is a sea bathing beach nearby, as well as famous historical sites such as Zhan Shan Temple. The entire sanatorium construction project occupies an area of more than 7,900 square meters. Currently, only two sanatorium buildings have been completed, one called Glory Building and the other called Happiness Building, as well as some game and sports venues. The sanatorium buildings are spacious and clean, with complete facilities, including a club, reading room, and bathroom. Each room has heating equipment, and the beds are soft and comfortable. The sanatorium members from all over the country were particularly excited upon entering the sanatorium, with some saying that it was simply entering a paradise for textile workers.

    When the sanatorium held its opening ceremony on August 15, Qian Zhiguang, Vice Minister of the Central Textile Industry Department, and Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union, attended and delivered speeches.

    中国纺织工人休养院成立
    中国纺织工会全国委员会在青岛海滨开办的中国纺织工人休养院已在八月中旬正式成立。首批来院的休养员共二百八十二人，其中有劳动模范、先进工作者、新从工人中提拔的干部、工程师和技术人员。
    休养院设在青岛市湛山东面的海滨上。这地区是适合于休养的胜地，背山面海，风景幽美，气候良好，附近有海水浴场，还有湛山寺等名胜古迹，整个休养院的建筑工程共占用面积七千九百多平方公尺，现在只修好两座休养大楼，一座叫光荣楼，一座叫幸福楼，和一些游戏与运动的场所。休养楼内宽敞清洁，设备齐全，有俱乐部、阅览室和浴室，每个房间都有暖气设备，床铺又软又松。从各地来的休养员进院后都格外兴奋，有的说这简直是进了纺织工人的乐园了。
    该院在八月十五日举行开幕典礼时，中央纺织工业部钱之光副部长和中国纺织工会全国委员会主席陈少敏等都亲临讲话。
