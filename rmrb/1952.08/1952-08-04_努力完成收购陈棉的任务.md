    Strive to Fulfill the Task of Purchasing Stored Cotton
    In June, the national cotton purchasing task only completed 52.16% of the planned amount. In the first and middle ten days of July, the cotton purchasing task only completed 46.25% of the monthly plan. If this situation, where the purchasing work lags behind the plan, is not changed in time, it will seriously affect the supply of raw cotton to spinning mills.
    Why has this situation arisen? The main reason is that some cadres of state-owned cotton purchasing agencies and cooperatives in some areas believe that new cotton is about to enter the market, that cotton farmers have little stored cotton left, and that the cotton purchasing work is nearing completion, so they have relaxed. Currently, cotton purchasing work has stalled in many parts of the country. For example, in northern Anhui, except for Anqing, all other areas have stopped purchasing cotton; the Luoning Cooperative in Henan Province posted a notice saying "Stop Buying Cotton" because it was engaged in other businesses. This practice is clearly wrong. On a national scale, this year's cotton purchasing task has not yet been fully completed, and some cotton farmers still have a certain amount of stored cotton to sell. Therefore, in areas where the cotton purchasing task has not been completed, it is necessary to make a final effort to strive for the complete and victorious completion of this year's cotton purchasing task.
    Of course, there are some new difficulties to overcome in the cotton purchasing work at present. For example, those who have stored cotton until now and have not yet sold it are mostly those who do not need the money urgently and have more serious "wait-and-see" mentality. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to strengthen patriotic education for them and focus on using facts to explain to them that cotton prices are stable, and waiting and waiting will only lead to the accumulation of cotton in their own hands; any lucky or speculative mentality regarding prices is unfavorable to both the country and themselves. At the same time, economic departments should strengthen the supply of production and living materials to cotton farmers. As long as these tasks are done well, the cotton purchasing task can certainly be completed.

### 努力完成收购陈棉的任务

    努力完成收购陈棉的任务
    六月份全国收购棉花任务只完成收购计划的百分之五二．一六，七月上、中旬收购棉花任务只完成月计划的百分之四六．二五。这种收购工作落后于计划的情况如不及时转变，将严重影响纱厂原棉的供应。
    为什么会造成这样一种状况呢？主要是部分地区的国营购棉机构和合作社的干部认为新棉即将上市，棉农所存陈棉已经不多，购棉工作已接近完成，因此产生了松一口气的现象。目前全国不少地区的购棉工作陷于停顿。如皖北地区除安庆一地外，其他各地都已停止购棉；河南省洛宁合作社因为开展其他业务，就贴出“停止收棉”的条子。这种作法显然是错的。就全国来讲，本年度的购棉任务尚未全部完成，部分棉农仍有一定数量的存棉可以出售。因此在未完成购棉任务的地区，必须最后努一把力，争取本年度购棉任务全部胜利完成。
    当然，购棉工作目前是有一些新的困难需要克服的。譬如：凡是把棉花存到现在而仍未出售的人，多是不等钱用和“看涨惜售”思想较严重的人，因此就要继续对他们加强进行爱国主义教育，并着重用事实向他们说明棉花价格是稳定的，等来等去，也不过是把棉花积压在自己手里就是了；凡是在价格上抱侥幸、投机取巧心理，对国家对自己都是不利的。同时，经济部门应加强对棉农生产、生活资料的供应。只要做好这些工作，购棉任务是一定能完成的。
