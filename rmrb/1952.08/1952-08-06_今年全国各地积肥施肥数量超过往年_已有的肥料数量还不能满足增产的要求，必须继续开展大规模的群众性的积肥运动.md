This year, the amount of manure accumulated and applied by farmers in various regions across the country during the spring season, as well as the amount of fertilizer supplied to farmers by the state, have both exceeded previous years. Farmers in many regions without the habit of applying fertilizer and in regions with extensive cultivation methods have begun to break with past conventions and pay attention to fertilizer application. In general areas of North China, the amount of fertilizer applied by farmers has increased by 15 to 20 percent compared to last year. The amount of fertilizer applied by farmers in the East China region has also increased significantly. The amount of base fertilizer applied by farmers in Shandong Province has increased by one-third compared to last year. The amount of base fertilizer applied by general farmers in Anhui Province has increased by 20 to 30 percent compared to last year. The total amount of soybean cake and chemical fertilizers sold in the entire East China region has increased by 60 to 70 percent compared to last year. The average amount of fertilizer applied to various crops in the Northwest region has increased by 20 percent compared to last year. The plan for supplying fine fertilizer in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province this year exceeds three and a half times the amount supplied last year. In Northeast China, the area of fertilized land accounted for 44.7 percent of the cultivated land area in 1949, reaching 60 percent last year and 65 percent this year. The amount of fertilizer applied per unit area of farmland in Northeast China has also increased year by year. In 1949, the average amount of fertilizer applied per hectare of land was 10 to 12 cartloads (approximately 1,500 jin per cartload), reaching 18 to 20 cartloads this year. In the Central-South and Southwest regions, land reform has just ended or is still in progress, and farmers' ability to invest in production is insufficient. Therefore, the amount of manure accumulated and applied in the spring season is not enough. However, in areas where land reform ended earlier and have already transitioned to production, the amount of manure accumulated and applied by farmers has increased rapidly. In some areas, the amount of manure accumulated this summer has increased by 50 to 70 percent compared to last year.

The significant increase in the amount of manure accumulated, applied, and supplied in various regions is a major progress in China's agricultural production. However, in terms of the overall situation of the country, the increased amount of fertilizer is still not sufficient to meet the needs of comprehensively increasing the yield per unit area this year. Even in the areas with the most fertilizer application, the amount of fertilizer applied by general farmers should and can still be increased. The amount of base fertilizer applied by farmers in the East China region during spring sowing was generally 10 to 20 percent less than the amount stipulated in this year's high-yield plan. In many places in the Northeast region, the fertilizer application plan was not completed during spring plowing and sowing. Heilongjiang Province only reached 40 percent of the fertilizer application plan. The amount of manure accumulated and applied by farmers in Hunan Province in the Central-South region this spring was one-third less than the amount needed to complete the high-yield plan. In many places in the Central-South, Southwest, and East China New Areas, farmers, especially the newly liberated poor peasants and farm laborers, are still planting rice seedlings in plain water this year. Some have just weeded the first crop of rice seedlings and no longer have the strength to apply top dressing fertilizer.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer, the Central Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on July 10 regarding launching a manure accumulation campaign, calling on farmers across the country to launch a large-scale manure accumulation campaign; and reminding local leading organs to regard manure accumulation work as a regular task of agricultural production. The Northeast Agricultural Department convened a fertilizer work conference in June, which determined this year's manure accumulation policy: to carry out a mass-based perennial manure accumulation campaign, fundamentally improve manure accumulation methods, open up fertilizer sources from multiple aspects, increase soil fertility, and increase yield per unit area. Other provinces and regions have also formulated manure accumulation plans and launched perennial or summer manure accumulation campaigns. Many regions have already made manure accumulation a major component of the current patriotic production increase competition.

    今年全国各地积肥施肥数量超过往年
    已有的肥料数量还不能满足增产的要求，必须继续开展大规模的群众性的积肥运动
    今年春季全国各地农民积肥、施肥的数量，和国家供给农民的肥料的数量，都超过了往年。许多没有施肥习惯的地区和耕作粗放的地区的农民，开始打破了过去的惯例，注意了施肥工作。华北一般地区农民施肥数量比去年增加了百分之十五到二十。华东区农民施肥数量也显著增加了。山东农民施用的基肥，比去年增加了三分之一。安徽一般农民施用的基肥，比去年增加了百分之二十到三十。华东全区销售的豆饼和化学肥料，比去年增加了百分之六十到七十。西北区各种作物施肥数量平均比去年增加了百分之二十。陕西关中地区今年供应细肥料的计划，超过去年供应数的三倍半。东北一九四九年施肥面积占耕地面积的百分之四十四点七，去年达到了百分之六十，今年达到了百分之六十五。东北农田单位面积施肥量也逐年提高了。一九四九年每垧地平均施肥十车到十二车（每车约一千五百斤），今年达到十八车到二十车。中南、西南两区的土地改革刚刚结束或正在进行，农民投资生产的力量不足，因此，春季积肥施肥的数量都不够多；但土地改革结束较早、已经转入生产的地区，农民积肥施肥数量增加得很快。有些地区今年夏季积肥数量比去年增加了百分之五十到七十。
    各地积肥、施肥、供肥数量大大增加，这是我国农业生产上的一个很大的进步。但是，就全国总的情况来说，肥料增加的数量，还不敷今年全面提高单位面积产量的需要。就在施肥最多的地区，一般农户的施肥量还是应当增加而且可以增加的。华东区农民今春播种时施用的基肥，一般比今年丰产计划的规定要少百分之十到二十。东北区很多地方在春耕播种时也没有完成施肥计划，黑龙江省只达到施肥计划的百分之四十。中南区湖南省农民今春积肥施肥的数量，比完成丰产计划需要的数量少三分之一。中南、西南、华东新区许多地方的农民，特别是刚翻身的贫雇农，今年仍然是插白水秧，有的刚薅过头道秧，就再无力施追肥了。
    为了解决肥料不足的问题，中央农业部已在七月十日发出了关于开展积肥运动的通知，号召全国农民开展一个大规模的积肥运动；并提醒各地领导机关，把积肥工作作为农业生产的经常工作。东北农业部在六月间召开了肥料工作会议，决定了今年的积肥方针：开展群众性的常年积肥运动，根本改善积肥方法，从多方面开辟肥源，增进地力，提高单位面积产量。其他各省区也纷纷制订积肥计划，开展常年的或夏季的积肥运动。很多地区都已把积肥作为当前爱国增产竞赛的主要内容。
