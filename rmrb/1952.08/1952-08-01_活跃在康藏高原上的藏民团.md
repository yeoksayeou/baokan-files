    On the eve of "August 1st" Army Day, this reporter visited the Tibetan People's Regiment of the Xikang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in a certain area of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province. Under the cultivation of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, this unit has rapidly grown into a new type of force in just one year since its establishment last year on "August 1st." They have not only inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army but have also become very strong through work and study.

    When this reporter visited the regiment, they had just returned from a rush on the production front and were advancing towards culture. Que Zha, the Deputy Chief of Staff who led the regiment in land reclamation and production, told me about their land reclamation process: When the Tibetan Plateau just began to thaw, the Tibetan People's Regiment received the task of land reclamation and production. The task required the regiment to play a leading and exemplary role in this year's major production campaign in the Tibetan Autonomous Region; to use inland farming methods to lead Tibetan farmers gradually towards scientific agricultural production. After the task was assigned, each company and soldier wrote guarantees and resolutions, unanimously proposing to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao and work hard in production. At that time, the regiment faced the difficulties of a shortage of agricultural tools and the imminent sowing season. However, the soldiers displayed a heroic and tenacious fighting spirit, putting forward the slogan of "overcoming difficulties, seizing the agricultural season, rushing to reclaim and sow." A red flag competition campaign was launched between platoons and squads. The soldiers were divided into four groups based on their physical strength: digging soil, breaking soil, picking grass, and sowing seeds. The digging soil group guaranteed deep digging; the breaking soil group guaranteed fine breaking; the picking grass group guaranteed clean picking; and the sowing group guaranteed even sowing. The breaking soil group went up the mountain to cut wood and made sturdy and durable wooden hoes. The picking grass group also created a grass-raking tool that could break soil and rake grass, greatly increasing the speed of picking grass. In the heat of the labor competition, the soldiers finally overcame various difficulties and completed the sowing work.

    In late spring and early summer, the rivers on the plateau were still covered with thin ice. The soldiers had to wade through the water, breaking the ice to reclaim land several miles away. Every afternoon, they often encountered storms from the plateau and gravel or ice mixed in the wind. The soldiers turned their bodies against the wind and continued to cultivate on the plateau with deep roots and thick grass. The soldiers constantly used the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting on the Korean front to encourage themselves, and many vivid and moving stories emerged. Tibetan soldier Song Erji was sent to the mountains to rush to transport charcoal, with a deadline of twelve days. He carried more and transported faster, completing the task half the time ahead of schedule. When a certain company was digging a canal, the stratum was all large stones. After digging for a day, the hoes were all rolled up, but only a layer of soil was uncovered. They immediately held a meeting to discuss and created a method of digging with oak wooden sticks, and the canal was completed in just one day. Thanks to the soldiers' perseverance, a thousand acres of wasteland were reclaimed into fertile fields in just forty days, and highland barley, wheat, potatoes, and vegetables were planted using the spot-planting method. Now the wheat and highland barley on the newly reclaimed land have already headed. The nearby Tibetan farmers all praised: Only Chairman Mao's troops can grow such good crops.

    The Tibetan People's Regiment is not only a fighting team and a production team, but it has also accepted the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army in cultural learning. This reporter visited a club of a certain unit. It showcased the excellent academic achievements of the soldiers. The soldiers are learning Chinese in accordance with the principle of voluntariness, and their enthusiasm is very high. From the beginning, they put forward the slogan of "capturing the cultural bunker." Everyone used their allowances to buy pens and notebooks and made learning plans. The soldiers took out their notebooks to write whenever they had free time. The cooks also learned to write in front of the stove. During the breaks in production, they also had counselors to teach and learn. A soldier named Dingji Jiangcuo originally only planned to recognize two thousand characters this year. But in this rapid literacy learning campaign, he only spent four days intensively studying, and he memorized all the two thousand characters taught. A week later, he was able to recognize more than eight hundred characters without phonetic symbols. In the study, leaders at all levels played a leading role, which encouraged everyone's learning enthusiasm. Wona, the head of the regiment, studied hard every day from early to late and was never absent from class, which was praised by the leaders of the military sub-district. The Han Chinese cultural teachers also carried forward the spirit of high national unity and friendship, paying attention to solving the difficulties of Tibetan soldiers in learning Chinese. They not only taught patiently in the classroom but also helped the soldiers after class. Li Weisheng, a cultural teacher in a certain unit, in order to make it easier for the soldiers to accept new words, in addition to using objects and drawing teaching, he also collected some Tibetan vocabulary for comparison and explanation. When some words could not be explained, he used expressions to explain them. With the enthusiastic help of commanders and fighters, cultural learning has achieved great results. Soldiers generally can recognize about 400 characters, and the most can recognize more than 1,500 characters. A very small number of soldiers with slow progress have also learned pinyin. Now the learning craze is continuing to rise.

### 活跃在康藏高原上的藏民团

    活跃在康藏高原上的藏民团
    新华社记者  王世晋
    “八一”节前夕，记者在西康省藏族自治区某地访问了藏族人民的子弟兵——中国人民解放军西康军区藏民团。这支部队在毛主席和共产党的培植下，从去年“八一”建团以来，只一年光景，已很快地成长为一支新型的部队了。他们不但继承和发扬了人民解放军的优良传统，并在工作和学习中锻炼得十分坚强。
    记者访问该团时，他们刚从生产战线上突击归来，向文化进军。领导该团开荒生产的副参谋长却札对我叙述了他们开荒生产的经过：当康藏高原上刚开始解冻的时候，藏民团就接受了开荒生产的任务。任务要求该团在藏族自治区今年的大生产运动中起带动作用和示范作用；运用内地的耕作方法，带领藏族农民逐步走向科学的农业生产的道路。任务布置下来以后，各个连队和战士都写了保证书和决心书，一致提出要做毛主席的好战士，努力生产。当时该团面临农具少和播种期迫近的困难。但战士们发挥了英勇顽强的战斗精神，提出了“克服困难，争取农时，抢开抢种”的口号。班、排间展开了红旗竞赛运动。战士们根据体力的强弱，分成了挖土、打土、检草、播种四个组。挖土组保证挖得深；打土组保证打得细；检草组保证检得净；播种组保证播得匀。打土组上山砍木料制成了坚实耐用的木锄。检草组也创造了一种耙草工具，可以打土又可以耙草，大大地增加了检草速度。在火热的劳动竞赛中，战士们终于战胜了各种困难，完成了播种工作。
    在春末夏初的时候，高原上的河流还结着薄冰。战士们必须涉水破冰到几里路以外去开荒。每到下午，常会遇到从高原上袭来的暴风和夹杂在风里的砂砾或冰块。战士们将身子背着风向，继续在根深草厚的高原上开垦。战士们时刻以在朝鲜前线战斗的志愿军的英勇事迹来鼓舞自己，出现了许多生动感人的事迹。藏族战士宋而吉被派到山上去抢运木炭，限期是十二天。他多背快运，提前一半时间完成了任务。某连在挖水堰时，因地层全是大石头，挖了一天，锄头都挖卷了，却只揭开了一层土。他们立即开会讨论，创造了用青杠木棍挖掘的办法，只一天时间就把水堰修通了。由于战士们坚韧不拔的毅力，短短的四十天内，一千亩荒地被垦成了良田，并用点种的方法种上了青稞、小麦、洋芋和菜蔬。现在新垦土地上的小麦、青稞已经出了穗。附近的藏族农民都称赞说：只有毛主席的队伍才能种出这样的好庄稼。
    藏民团不仅是一支战斗队和生产队，在文化学习上也接受了人民解放军的优良传统。记者曾参观了某部俱乐部。这里展示了战士们学习文化的优良成绩。战士们在自愿的原则下学习汉文，他们的热情非常高。一开始他们就提出了“攻下文化碉堡”的口号。大家都用津贴费买了钢笔和笔记本，订立了学习计划。战士们一有空就拿出本子来写。炊事员们在灶门前也学习着写字。在生产空隙时间，他们还有辅导员来包教包学。一个叫丁吉降错的战士，原来只计划在今年认识二千个字。但是在这次开展速成识字学习中，他只突击了四天，就把所教的二千多个单字都记了下来。一个星期以后，他并能撇开注音符号而认识八百多字了。在学习中各级领导都起了带头作用，鼓舞了大家的学习情绪。该团团长沃纳每天都起早睡晚地苦学，从不缺课，受到了军分区领导机关的表扬。汉族文化教员们也发扬了高度的民族团结友爱的精神，注意解决藏族战士学习汉文的困难。他们不但在课堂上耐心讲授，在下课后还帮助战士们。某部文化教员李薉生为了使战士们容易接受生字，除了采用实物、绘图教学外，他还收集了一些藏语语汇来对照讲解。有些字不能解释时，他就用表情来说明。指挥员和战斗员们在文化教员的热情帮助下，文化学习获得了很大的成绩。战士中一般已能识四百字左右，最多的已能识一千五百字以上，极少数进度慢的战士也学会了拼音。现在学习热潮正在继续高涨中。
