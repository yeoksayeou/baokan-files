    Central Ministry of Agriculture Issues a Notice on "Emphasizing the Prevention and Control of Autumn Locusts"
    Due to the failure to completely eradicate summer locusts in some areas and the relaxation of prevention and control work against autumn locusts, autumn locusts have begun to appear in these areas. In more than ten counties around Weishan Lake to Dongping Lake in Shandong and Pingyuan provinces, the autumn locust situation is quite serious. Among them, Jialiang County in the Huxi area of Pingyuan Province has the highest density, with more than 600 locust nymphs per square foot, exceeding the severity of the summer locusts before the wheat harvest.
    In order to ensure that farmers obtain a bountiful autumn harvest for their year's hard work, the Central People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture has issued a "Notice on Emphasizing the Prevention and Control of Autumn Locusts." The notice emphasizes that autumn nymphs develop quickly and are difficult to catch and kill. A slight relaxation will cause serious disasters, and the results of summer locust control will be completely wasted. To this end, all localities should immediately raise their vigilance, quickly and closely check for nymphs and hatching, and strictly monitor the activities of locust nymphs. In sparsely populated coastal saline-alkali wastelands, lake marshes, and river flooding areas, locust control organizations must be greatly strengthened, equipped with sufficient personnel, prepared to grasp the locust situation, and adopt a tactic of complete annihilation, mainly through drug and mechanical elimination, supplemented by manual capture and killing, under unified leadership, with partitioned responsibility to completely eradicate them. Regarding locusts that have been scattered and spread over a larger area, it is necessary to pay attention to new developments, universally mobilize the masses, use manual capture and killing as the main method, supplemented by focusing on the use of drugs and machinery, and earnestly do a good job in joint prevention at the junction of regions, providing mutual support regardless of province or county, in order to ensure that no locusts escape the net and guarantee the autumn harvest.

    中央农业部发出“重视防治秋蝗”的通知
    由于部分地区夏蝗未能彻底扑灭，并放松了对秋蝗的防治工作，目前这些地区已陆续发生秋蝗。山东、平原两省自微山湖至东平湖周围十多个县，秋蝗情况相当严重，其中平原省湖西专区嘉祥县最密处每平方尺有六百多个蝗蝻，严重程度超过了麦收前的夏蝗。
    为确保农民一年辛劳而获得丰盈的秋收，中央人民政府农业部特发出“重视防治秋蝗”的通知。通知中强调指出：秋蝻发育快、捕打难，稍一松懈，就将造成严重灾害；而防治夏蝗的成果，也将全功尽弃。为此，各地应立即提高警惕，迅速而又严密地查蝻、查孵化，严格监视蝗蝻的活动，在人烟稀少的沿海盐碱荒地，湖沼洼地和河流泛滥区，都必须大大加强治蝗机构，配备足够力量，准备掌握蝗情，采取以药械消灭为主、人力捕打为辅的一鼓歼灭的战术，在统一领导下，分区包干，以求彻底扑灭。对部分被打分散、面积扩大了的蝗虫，必须重视新的发展，普遍发动群众，以人力捕打为主、重点使用药械的办法，并在地区交界处切实做好联防，不分省县相互支援，以达到不让蝗虫漏网，保证秋收。（新华社）
