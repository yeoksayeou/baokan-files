    To the Editor: Regarding the reader Su Jinping's complaint, published in the "Reader's Letters" section on July 9th, accusing our county's Public Security Bureau cadres, Chen Jinbao and others, of interfering in freedom of marriage and infringing upon human rights, we immediately dispatched suitable cadres from the County People's Government Public Security Bureau, People's Supervision Committee, CCP County Committee Discipline Inspection Committee, CCP Third District Committee, and the Third District Office to Dongxue Village to investigate this incident. After investigation, we confirmed that Su Jinping's complaint was basically consistent with the facts, but a few points should be supplemented and clarified: Chen Jinbao and village cadres did not say "people with the same surname cannot marry." Regarding the issue of withholding the migration certificate: Su Jinping took a letter of introduction from the district to the County Public Security Bureau to obtain a migration certificate. The letter of introduction stated she was looking for Su Peiyuan, but she herself said she was "looking for her father." Li Zhentao, a cadre in the Public Security Bureau's household registration section, issued the migration certificate to her, but then felt something was wrong. Without consulting his superiors, he notified Chen Jinbao and requested a review. If there were any problems, it should be taken back. Chen Jinbao then kept the migration certificate. The detention of Su Peisheng was the idea of village cadres like Su Yuchao. Limiting Su Peiying to ten days to bring Su Jinping back from Beijing was requested by Su Jinping's brother, Su Jindong, and the village cadres; Zhang Hongkai, secretary of the district office, agreed. These two matters were unrelated to Chen Jinbao, as he had already left Dongxue Village at that time.
    This incident shows that some of our county's cadres still have insufficient understanding of the Marriage Law, and some cadres still have the bad habit of commandism. Our Party and government leading organs are responsible for the inadequate education of cadres. In addition to strengthening cadre education in the future and having the cadres involved in this incident conduct self-criticism, we have also instructed the Party and government discipline inspection organs to give appropriate punishment according to the severity of the mistakes of the relevant cadres.

### 故城县党政领导机关  检查干部干涉婚姻自由事件

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    故城县党政领导机关
    检查干部干涉婚姻自由事件
    编辑同志：七月九日“读者来信专页”刊登了读者苏金平控诉我县公安局干部陈锦宝等干涉婚姻自由、侵犯人权的谈话，我们立即从县人民政府公安局、人民监察委员会、中共县委纪律检查委员会、中共三区区委会和第三区区公所等机关，抽派了适当的干部，到董学村去检查这一事件。经过调查，肯定苏金平的控诉基本上是符合事实的，但有几点应该加以补充和说明：陈锦宝和村干部等都没说过“同姓不能结婚”的话。关于扣留迁移证的问题：苏金平拿了区的介绍信到县公安局去领迁移证，介绍信上写的是找苏佩元，但她自己却说是“去找父亲”。公安局户籍股干事李振涛把迁移证发给了她，又觉得不对头，未向领导同志请示，就通知陈锦宝，还要审查一下，如有问题，即予收回。陈锦宝就把迁移证留下了。扣押苏佩生是村干部苏玉超等的主张。限苏佩英十天把苏金平从北京找回，是苏金平的哥哥苏金栋和村干部们这样要求的，区公所秘书张鸿凯同意了。这两件事和陈锦宝无关，当时他已离开董学村了。
    这件事说明我县有些干部对婚姻法的认识还很不够，有些干部还存在着命令主义的不良作风。我们党政领导机关对干部教育不够，是应该负责的。我们除了在今后加强干部教育，并让和这件事有关的干部进行检讨外，并责成党政纪律检查机关根据各有关干部错误的轻重，分别给以适当处理。  中共故城县委员会  故城县人民政府
