Report on Carrying Out the Patriotic Health Campaign
(Summary of a report given by Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, at the First Session of the Fourth Beijing Municipal People's Congress on August 11, 1952)

The effects of Beijing's patriotic health campaign have been significant. We can cite two examples to illustrate this: First, the number of flies and mosquitoes in the city has indeed been greatly reduced this year. Even the fish and meat markets, which are most prone to attracting flies, have very few flies this year. In the work of mosquito control, eight area branches in the Third, Fourth, and Seventh Districts have successively achieved the elimination of mosquito larvae; Second, the incidence and mortality rates of infectious diseases have been significantly reduced. Taking the incidence and mortality rates of the nine major acute infectious diseases as an example, if we take the incidence and mortality rates from April to June 1951 as 100, the incidence rate for the same period in 1952 decreased to 71, and the mortality rate decreased to 46.

The major clean-up work was carried out quite thoroughly. From mid-March to early April, continuous clean-up was carried out in more than 95 percent of the areas in the city. During the clean-up period, the amount of garbage transported out of the urban area each day increased by about one-third compared to normal. From mid-March to mid-July, a total of more than 268,000 cubic meters of garbage were cleared. The "Xu Zhuangyuan Mansion" in Suzhou Hutong in the First District had not been cleaned for more than forty years, and was covered with dust and weeds. The non-tourist areas of the Forbidden City had polluted canals, and a garbage accumulation of more than 183,000 cubic meters, some of which dated back to the Ming Dynasty. Through this health campaign, these long-standing dirt and filth have been cleared and are being cleared. Many large courtyards where working people live have now been cleaned up.

Secondly, the various sanitary projects constructed by the Municipal People's Government over the past three years to improve the people's environmental sanitation are also of great significance. During this patriotic health campaign, we first dredged the lower reaches of the Longxu Canal, converted the open ditch into a covered ditch, and diverted it eastward into the city moat. We also excavated the reed marshes and depressions in the Taoranting area and Longtan inside Zuo'anmen to turn them into living water lakes. Depressions such as Taiping Lake, Paoju, and Beiguanting were filled and leveled. Seven major open ditches in the city, such as the Tielukub in Nanheng Street, were converted into sewers this year. Together with the new sewers built to solve the problems of sewage and rainwater drainage in other areas, a total of about 30 kilometers of new sewers were built (including sewers in the suburbs, a total of 46.4 kilometers were built this year), and 60 kilometers of sewers were renovated.

Some of these projects have been completed, and some are under construction. Thousands of working people are now working tirelessly on various construction sites to change the filthy environment.

The broad masses of people have been eliminating disease-carrying animals with great enthusiasm. As of the end of July, according to incomplete statistics, the city has caught more than 583,000 rats and blocked more than 440,000 rat holes; eliminated more than 140 million adult flies, and, more importantly, eliminated fly pupae and maggots, estimated to total more than 1 billion; in order to eliminate the living conditions of mosquitoes and flies, more than 68,000 manure pits in the city have been covered, and more than 17,000 manure pits have been deepened; a total of more than 11,000 large and small water pits have been filled, nearly 50,000 tree holes have been blocked, and insecticide has been sprayed on nearly 300,000 square meters of mosquito breeding areas. The sanitary conditions of food and drink have also been initially improved. Health training and vaccination work have been widely carried out throughout the city.

The depth and breadth of this health campaign are unprecedented. Through this campaign, not only has the public's level of health knowledge been raised and the capital's sanitary conditions further improved, but also the public's health habits have been established, and the unhealthy habits have been changed.

This campaign proves that the wisdom of the masses is inexhaustible. In the face of the great strength of the masses, there are no insurmountable difficulties. In the category of rat-catching tools alone, the masses have manufactured as many as 65 kinds.

The shortcomings and problems that currently exist in the work are, first of all, that a relaxed mood and a sense of complacency are growing in a few cadres and masses. Some people think that "this year's health work has been done almost enough," "doing health work will affect production," and "health work is like a gust of wind that will pass." Responsible cadres of some agencies and organizations have not paid enough attention to health work, thinking that health work is the business of the health departments.

Secondly, there are still some blank spots in some places. In addition, in the vaccination work, due to the careless style of a few medical staff, the health training also has a tendency to be formalistic to some extent.

As for the removal of feces, it is still not done very well. Some pits in the Seventh District have no soil to fill, a large number of mosquito larvae breed in the paddy fields in the Eighth District, it is difficult to completely eliminate the garbage disposal sites for a while, and the water volume in rivers and lakes is insufficient, which still inevitably breeds some mosquitoes, larvae, etc. These are all problems that need to be gradually solved in the future.

From the work of the past four months, the most fundamental experience we have gained is that to do a good job in health work, we must mobilize the masses. This is the key that determines everything. Only with the conscious efforts of the masses can health work be more universal and in-depth. In particular, the broad masses of housewives play a decisive role in the environmental sanitation of the family.

Secondly, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses and improve the working level of the masses, it is necessary to conduct in-depth inspections, conscientiously summarize, promote advanced experiences, and promptly give commendations and criticisms during the movement. In particular, publishing criticisms in newspapers and carrying out challenge-response and red flag competitions have greatly promoted the movement. At the same time, at an appropriate time in each task, it is necessary to establish systems in a timely manner to consolidate the work enthusiasm of the masses.

At present, Beijing's patriotic health campaign is in the most decisive stage. From August 4th to 10th, a patriotic health campaign shock week was launched throughout the city. According to our plan, in September, we will continue to block rat holes with rat catching as the focus, and implement a "clear the fields" policy to isolate rats from all food and eliminate their living conditions.

In order to successfully complete the great task of the patriotic health campaign, all agencies, troops, factories, schools, shops, streets, villages, and towns must formulate practical and feasible plans to ensure that these "six pests" – rats, flies, mosquitoes, lice, fleas, and bedbugs – are gradually and completely eliminated in each unit. Units or individuals who do not work hard to eliminate these "six pests" must be criticized, and units or individuals who eliminate them thoroughly should be commended. Certain units that are still "blank spots" or do not pay attention to the patriotic health campaign must immediately change this irresponsible attitude towards the people and earnestly do a good job in the health work of the unit.

    关于开展爱国卫生运动的报告
    （一九五二年八月十一日在北京市第四届第一次各界人民代表会议上的报告摘要）
    北京市人民政府副市长  吴晗
    北京市的爱国卫生运动，所收到的效果是很显著的，我们可以举两个例子来说明：第一、今年本市的苍蝇、蚊子确实大大地减少了。一些最容易招惹苍蝇的鱼肉市场到这时候还很少看到苍蝇。在灭蚊工作中，在三区、四区、七区已经先后出现了八个没有孑孓的地区分会；第二、传染病的发病数和死亡数显著地减少了。以危害较大的九种急性传染病的发病数和死亡数为例，如以一九五一年四至六月的发病数与死亡数各为一百，则一九五二年同期发病数减到七十一，死亡数减到四十六。
    清洁大扫除工作进行得相当彻底，从三月中旬到四月上旬，在全市有百分之九十五以上的地区都进行了不断的扫除。在扫除期间，城区每日运出的垃圾较平时平均增加了约三分之一。从三月中旬到七月中旬，共清除了垃圾二十六万八千多公方。一区苏州胡同“徐状元府”四十多年未曾打扫过，尘土堆积，蓬蒿遍地。故宫非游览区，河渠污浊，垃圾存量达十八万三千多公方，有些并且是明朝遗留下来的。通过这次卫生运动，这些积世的污秽都已经清除和正在清除。许多劳动人民聚居的大杂院，现在都收拾得干干净净了。
    其次，为了改善人民的环境卫生，市人民政府三年多以来修建的各项卫生工程也是具有重要意义的。在这次爱国卫生运动期间，我们首先疏浚了龙须沟的下游，并改明沟为暗沟，改道向东流入护城河，又掏挖了陶然亭地区和左安门内龙潭的苇塘洼地使之变为活水湖。太平湖、炮局、北官厅等洼地均加以填垫，市内南横街铁辘轳把等七处较大的明沟今年一律改建下水道，连同为解决其他地区污水、雨水排泄的困难，共新建下水道约三十公里（连同郊区的下水道，今年共新建四十六点四公里），整修下水道六十公里。
    以上这些工程有的已经完工，有的正在施工。数千劳动人民现在正在各个工地，为改变污秽环境而进行不倦的斗争。
    广大人民以高度的热情来消灭病媒动物。截至七月底，据不完全的统计，全市共捕鼠五十八万三千余只，堵鼠洞四十四万多个；消灭成蝇一亿四千多万头，尤其重要的是消灭蝇蛹和蛆，估计总数在十亿以上；为了消灭蚊蝇的生存条件，全市有六万八千多个粪坑加了盖，有一万七千多个粪坑加深了；共填平了一万一千多个大小水坑，堵树洞近五万个，在近三十万平方公尺的孳生孑孓的地方喷射了杀虫药剂。　饮食物的卫生状况，也有了初步改善。卫生训练和预防接种工作，已在全市普遍展开。
    这次卫生运动的深入和广泛是空前的，通过这次运动不仅提高了群众的卫生知识水平，进一步改善了首都的卫生状况，并且建立了群众的卫生习惯，改变了不讲卫生的风气。
    这一次运动证明：群众的智慧是无穷无尽的，在伟大的群众力量面前，没有不可克服的困难。仅捕鼠工具一项，群众自己制造的即达六十五种。
    目前工作中存在的缺点和目前存在的问题，首先是在少数的干部和群众中，正滋长着松懈情绪和麻痹思想。有人以为“今年的卫生工作，做得差不多了”，“搞卫生会影响生产”，“卫生工作像一阵风，刮过去就完了”。若干机关、团体的负责干部还没有足够地重视卫生工作。以为卫生工作是卫生部门的事。
    其次，有些地方还存在着空白点。此外，在预防接种工作中，由于少数医护人员仍有粗枝大叶作风，卫生训练，也多少存在着形式主义的倾向。
    至于粪便的清除还作得不很好，七区有些坑洼无土可填，八区稻田大量孳生孑孓，垃圾待运场一时难以全部取消，以及河湖水量不足，还难免孳生一些蚊虫、孑孓等，都是今后需要逐步解决的问题。
    从四个月来的工作中，我们取得的最根本的一条经验是：要做好卫生工作，必须发动群众，这是决定一切的关键。唯有在群众自觉地努力下，才可能使卫生工作更加普遍、深入。尤其是广大的家庭妇女，对于家庭的环境卫生，起着决定的作用。
    其次，为鼓舞群众情绪，提高群众的工作水平，在运动过程中，必须深入检查，认真总结，推广先进经验，并及时提出表扬与批评。尤其是登报批评，开展挑战应战和红旗竞赛，对运动的推动作用很大。同时，在每一项工作进行到适当时期，必须及时地订立制度，以巩固群众的工作热情。
    目前，本市的爱国卫生运动，正处在最有决定性的阶段。自八月四日到十日在全市范围内开展了爱国卫生运动突击周，根据我们的计划，九月份，将再以捕鼠为重点，继续堵塞鼠洞，并实行“坚壁清野”，使老鼠与一切食物隔绝，以消灭其生存条件。
    为了胜利完成爱国卫生运动的伟大任务，各机关、部队、工厂、学校、商店、街道、村镇都必须订出切实可行的计划，保证在各个单位内逐步彻底消灭这“六害”——老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子、虱子、跳蚤、臭虫。凡是不努力消灭这“六害”的单位或个人都必须受到批评，凡是消灭彻底的单位或个人都应受到表扬。某些直到现在还是“空白点”或不重视爱国卫生运动的单位，必须立刻改变这种对人民不负责的态度，切实认真地把该单位的卫生工作做好。
