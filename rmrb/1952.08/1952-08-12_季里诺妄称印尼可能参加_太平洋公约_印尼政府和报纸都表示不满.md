    Quirino Falsely Claims Indonesia Might Join "Pacific Pact"
    Indonesian Government and Newspapers Express Dissatisfaction
    Indonesian Economic Minister Accuses the United States of Manipulating Tin Prices
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 8th] Jakarta News: Indonesian government officials and Indonesian newspapers have expressed strong dissatisfaction with the statement made by Philippine puppet President Quirino to a United Press reporter in Manila on August 4th, saying that Indonesia would participate in the "Pacific Pact" if invited.
    Indonesian Prime Minister Wilopo told an Antara News Agency reporter that Indonesia is now more committed than ever to pursuing an independent foreign policy, and Indonesia is not considering any pacts. He said that economic cooperation with other countries is more important than any pact, and Indonesia will never join any "defensive alliance."
    "Kompas," the organ of the Indonesian Socialist Party, said, "If Quirino wanted to express an opinion at the request of a reporter, he could have made a statement on Philippine policy, but he should never have made a statement on Indonesian politics. Although he visited Indonesia, he cannot use this as a reason to express opinions on Indonesian politics, let alone express his personal opinions on Indonesian politics in a statement."
    "Abadi," the organ of the Indonesian Masyumi Party, denounced Quirino's statement as "untrue." The newspaper also pointed out that Quirino may be attempting to express opinions on Indonesian politics as part of political propaganda in the upcoming Philippine presidential election.
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 8th] TASS Jakarta, August 7th: Indonesian Economic Minister Sumarno issued a formal statement to the press, expressing surprise at the report published in the newspaper that US Senator Johnson accused Indonesia of "bad faith."
    In his statement, Sumarno explained that the rise in tin prices was caused by the United States hoarding large quantities of tin and attempting to become the sole buyer of this metal. When the United States gains this position, it will force tin-producing countries to lower tin prices to a level that the United States deems appropriate.
    Sumarno concluded: "We emphasize again that the US policy of manipulating prices will force tin-producing countries not only to stop producing tin but also to stop producing other important raw materials."

    季里诺妄称印尼可能参加“太平洋公约”
    印尼政府和报纸都表示不满
    印尼经济部长指责美国操纵锡价
    【新华社八日讯】雅加达消息：印尼政府人士和印尼报纸对于菲律宾傀儡总统季里诺八月四日在马尼拉向美国合众社记者发表谈话说，印尼如果接到邀请，就会参加“太平洋公约”一事，表示强烈的不满。
    印尼总理韦洛坡对安塔拉通讯社记者说，印尼现在比以往更要奉行独立的外交政策，印尼没有想到任何公约。他说，与其他国家在经济上合作比任何公约更为重要，印尼决不加入任何“防御联盟”。
    印尼社会党机关报“指南针报”说：“假如季里诺应记者之请而要发表一点意见，他原可以就菲律宾政策发表声明，而决不应就印尼的政治发表声明。他虽然曾到印尼访问过，但他不能以此为理由而就印尼的政治发表意见，更不用说在声明中就印尼的政治发表他个人的意见了。”
    印尼玛斯友美党机关报“永恒报”斥责季里诺的声明“不真实”。该报并指出，季里诺可能是尝试对印尼的政治发表意见，以作为在即将到来的菲律宾总统选举中进行的政治宣传的一部分。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社雅加达七日讯：印尼经济部长苏玛南对报界发表正式声明，对于报纸上发表的美国参议员约翰森在报告中指责印尼“不守信用”一事，表示诧异。
    苏玛南在他的声明中解释说：锡价的上涨，是由于美国囤积大量的锡并企图成为此种金属唯一的买主而造成的。当美国获得这种地位时，它就要迫使产锡国家把锡价降低到美国认为合宜的水平。
    苏玛南最后说：“我们再次强调指出，美国操纵价格的政策将迫使产锡国家不仅停止产锡，而且也停止生产其他重要的原料。”
