    Certain Units of the Tianjin Railway Administration Falsely Reported Achievements and Have Been Dealt With

    To the Editor: The fact that Comrade Guo Zhongxia pointed out in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on July 22nd that our Administration's Tianjin, Guye, and Kouquan stations had falsely reported loading achievements is indeed true. The details of the situation and the results of our handling are reported as follows:

    The course of events was as follows: On June 30th, our Administration discovered that the number of cars loaded throughout the Administration had suddenly increased, exceeding the general loading pattern. We immediately assigned the Statistics and Transportation Departments to conduct inspections separately. As a result, we found that some stations reported 397 cars that had not yet been loaded by 6:00 PM as loaded at 6:00 PM (railway car loading is limited to 6:00 PM), because they attempted to increase the loading performance for June. This seriously affected the accuracy of statistical figures and planning work. This was extremely wrong. In order to correct this bad practice of not following the system, we published the results of the inspection in the Railway Worker's Newspaper and the Tianjin Daily, and the leaders of the Railway Administration also criticized the stations that falsely reported achievements at a telephone conference. The stationmasters of these stations were also ordered to make self-criticisms. In addition to strictly enforcing various statistical reporting systems, we will continue to strengthen education for on-site employees to prevent similar errors from happening again.

### 天津铁路管理局某些单位假报成绩已予处理

    天津铁路管理局某些单位假报成绩已予处理
    编辑同志：郭中霞同志在七月二十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏中指出我局天津、古冶和口泉车站有假报装车成绩的现象，是确有其事的。现把经过的情形和我们处理的结果报告如下：
    事情经过是这样的：六月三十日，我局发现全局装车数量突然增多，超出了一般的装车规律。我们即指派统计、车务两处分别进行检查。结果，我们查出有些车站把十八点尚未装好的三百九十七个车，报在十八点了（铁路装车以十八点为限），原因是他们企图提高六月份的装车成绩。结果严重地影响了统计数字和计划工作的准确性。这是非常错误的。为纠正这种不按制度办事的坏作风，我们曾把检查的结果，分别在铁路工人报和天津日报上公布了，同时路局的领导方面在电话会议上对假报成绩的各站也进行了批评。并责令这几个车站的站长作了检讨。现我们除严格各种统计报告制度外，还要继续加强对现场职工进行教育，以防止类似错误再发生。
    天津铁路管理局统计处、车务处
