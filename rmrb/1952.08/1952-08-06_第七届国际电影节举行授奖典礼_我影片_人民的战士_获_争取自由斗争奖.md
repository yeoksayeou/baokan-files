    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社卡罗维·发利讯：在捷克斯洛伐克的卡罗维·发利举行的第七届国际电影节已胜利闭幕。电影节在三日举行了授奖仪式。
    捷克斯洛伐克总理萨波托斯基在授奖仪式上发表演说，他着重指出了本届电影节在政治和文化上的重大意义，并预祝参加电影节的人们在宣传本届电影节的口号——“为和平、为新的人、为人类更美好的将来！”——中所表现的理想时获得更大的成就。萨波托斯基的演说一再为听众的掌声所打断。布拉格音乐学院院长、国际电影节评判委员会主席布劳西尔接着发言，他详细地叙述了在本届电影片中得奖的影片的特点，和得奖国家的电影事业的伟大成就。
    本届电影节得奖影片如下：
    苏联影片“难忘的一九一九年”得“特等奖”。苏联和德意志民主共和国电影工作者共同摄制的影片“我们拥护和平”和德意志民主共和国影片“不速之客”同得和平奖。中华人民共和国影片“人民的战士”和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国影片“重返前线”获得“争取自由斗争奖”。捷克斯洛伐克五彩片“明天处处欢乐歌舞”获得“国际友谊奖”。匈牙利影片“火的洗礼”获得“劳动奖”。罗马尼亚影片“米特里亚·柯可尔”和印度影片“巴不拉”获得“争取社会进步斗争奖”。

    【新华社布拉格四日电】我国参加在捷克斯洛伐克的卡罗维·发利举行的第七届国际电影节比赛的影片和电影工作者，已得到四个奖。在三日举行的授奖仪式上，我国故事片“人民的战士”荣获“争取自由斗争奖”，“内蒙人民的胜利”的剧本作者王震之获得电影剧本奖，“翠岗红旗”的摄影师冯四知获得摄影工作奖，中国纪录影片“抗美援朝”和“抗战的越南”获“劳动人民争取和平斗争奖”。国际电影节评判委员会对“人民的战士”的评语说：“这部影片有力地表现了中国劳动人民在解放战争中所取得的历史性胜利，并表现了中国共产党怎样提高中国人民的阶级觉悟，因而打败反动派的武力。”
    朝鲜新闻片和文献纪录片多部因为摄影师的英勇精神和影片对朝鲜前后方情况的真实描写，特别是因为提供了不容抵赖的证据，证明美帝国主义者在朝鲜进行细菌战的野蛮行为，因而获得了战斗报道奖。
    当评判委员会宣布颁奖给中国和朝鲜摄影师时，全场肃然起立，为在朝鲜反对美国侵略者的斗争中牺牲的全体摄影师默哀。
    参加电影节的我国代表团即将前往捷克斯洛伐克各地，参加正在进行中的劳动人民电影节。在国际电影节上得奖的中国影片，都将在这次电影节中放映。
