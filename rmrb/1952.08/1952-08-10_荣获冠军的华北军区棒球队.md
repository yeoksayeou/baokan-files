The North China Military Region baseball team, which won the championship in the "August 1st" Sports Meet with repeated victories, consists of squad leaders and soldiers from various companies, except for one platoon leader and one deputy platoon leader. They were originally scattered in various companies of a certain regiment. In the second half of 1949, the leadership called for the development of baseball sports. Because baseball has a special effect on exercising physical strength and eyesight, cultivating the revolutionary heroism of brave and enterprising regular soldiers, agile and flexible movements, rapid and decisive judgment, and cooperation, and it is a very meaningful collective game that can absorb dozens of people at the same time, which can enliven the cultural life of the troops. At that time, young soldiers enthusiastically responded to the call of their superiors and organized baseball teams in their companies, going to the playground to practice during their game time every day.

These young soldiers were mostly farmers who had just put down their hoes to join the army, and had never seen baseball before. Baseball has strict rules and requires precise calculations, making it a very complex ball skill. When they first learned to play baseball, they were not skilled and were often hit by the ball, resulting in bruises on their noses and swollen and bruised bodies, hands, or legs. At that time, the troops had financial difficulties, and there were very few baseball equipment. But all these difficulties did not stop the young soldiers from moving forward. If they didn't have a ball, they would use thread to wrap it into a ball; or they would use cotton inside and sew pigskin outside to use as a ball; the bats were made of whittled wooden sticks; the gloves, chest protectors, masks, and knee pads were made from old cannon covers. They practiced all day long, and the balls were quickly broken. Some soldiers sacrificed sleep time to mend them. Chen Chunlan, the captain of the baseball team, always had thick, swollen fingers when she first started practicing. Jiang Mengxi, who is now one of the most outstanding players, has lost count of how many times his thighs and elbows have been scraped while practicing sliding. The young soldiers practiced with the spirit of fighting, and many quickly became excellent baseball players.

At the end of 1949, in order to increase the interest of the vast number of soldiers, promote revolutionary heroism, and more widely promote this beneficial sport, the regiment's leadership held a baseball team observation competition. After the meeting, fifteen excellent players were selected from each company to form the regiment's baseball team. The regiment invited experts to train them, stipulating that they should gather to practice during their daily game time, and later specifically transferred them to a company and assigned them to guide and coach in various companies. Among these fifteen people, there were seven Communist Party members, five Communist Youth League members, and four who had performed meritorious service in combat. They made covenants as if they had accepted a combat mission, and made guarantees to the Party and the League to study and practice diligently. A year later, they trained into an excellent baseball team, cultivated their accurate pitchers Zou Guozhong and Gong Tingqing, and outstanding catchers Jiang Mengxi and Zhang Shuque. In October 1950, this young baseball team participated in the sports meeting held in Beijing for the first time, and won the championship in the competition with the five baseball teams in the military group. In order to promote the development of baseball in the whole army, they held a successful performance at the "May Fourth" All-Army Basketball and Volleyball Competition last year. This year, they gloriously represented the North China Military Region in the All-Army "August 1st" Sports Meet as a regiment baseball team and won the championship.

This glorious baseball team, due to their demonstration role and personally going to various troops to promote coaching, has made great contributions to the widespread development of baseball in the North China troops. In 1949, there were only three baseball teams established at the same time as them in the entire North China Military Region, but now every regiment has a baseball team. In their regiment, each company even has two baseball teams, and generally speaking, they all play very well. Baseball has become a favorite sport for the vast number of soldiers.

Developing baseball sports is of great significance for regular soldiers, especially for enabling soldiers to develop strong physiques and agile movements. The soldiers all call this baseball squad the "Strongman Squad." Once when repairing the auditorium, heavy stone bars could not be moved by four people, but two of their team members could lift them up and run away. This "Strongman Squad" can also disassemble and assemble weapons with the most rapid movements. In terms of learning culture, because they are full of energy, their grades are excellent. This year, four study models have emerged from this baseball team. As Chen Chunlan, the captain of the baseball team, said after winning the championship in the All-Army competition: "We are not just playing for fun, nor are we competing for championships, because we are the people's soldiers, and we shoulder a glorious mission. We must train ourselves to become invincible warriors, to defend our most beloved motherland, and to defend the beautiful lives of our people!" (Xinhua News Agency)

    荣获冠军的华北军区棒球队
    谢丁
    在“八一”体育运动大会上屡战屡胜、荣获冠军的华北军区棒球队，除了其中有一个排长和一个副排长之外，都是连队的班长和战士。他们原来是分散在某团各个连队里的。一九四九年下半年，领导上号召开展棒球体育运动。因为棒球对锻炼体力、视力，培养正规军人勇敢进取的革命英雄主义精神、敏捷灵活的动作、迅速果决的判断力和配合协同等方面有特殊的作用，而且这是一种可以同时吸收几十个人参加的很有意义的集体游戏，可以活跃部队的文化生活。当时青年战士们热烈地响应了上级的号召，在自己的连队里组织起棒球队，每天游戏时间到操场上去练习。
    这些青年战士大都是刚扔下锄头参军的农民，完全没有见过棒球。而棒球有严格的规则，需要精确的计算，是很复杂的一种球艺。他们刚学打棒球时不熟练，往往被球打得鼻青眼肿，身上青一块紫一块，撞肿了手或跌破了腿。当时部队经费还困难，打球的用具也很少。但这一切困难都没有阻挡住青年战士们前进。没有球，他们就用线来缠成球；或者里面用棉花外面缝上猪皮当球打；棒子是用木棍削成的；手套、胸衣、面罩和护膝是用旧炮衣改做的。他们整天地练，球很快地打烂了。有的战士就牺牲睡眠时间来缝补。棒球队队长陈春兰在当初练球时，手指总是肿得粗粗的。现在已经成为最优秀球员之一的姜梦喜，已经记不清练滑垒时大腿和臂肘被擦破过几次了。青年战士们以战斗的精神来练习，许多人都很快地成了优秀的棒球队员。
    一九四九年年底，团的领导上为了提高广大战士的兴趣，发扬革命英雄主义，更广泛地推动这个有益的运动，举行了全团棒球队观摩比赛大会。会后在各连选出十五名优秀的球手，组成团的棒球队。团里请了专家来训练他们，规定他们在每天游戏时间集合起来练球，后来并专门把他们调集到一个连里，并分配他们到各个连队去指导教练。这十五个人当中，有七位共产党员，五位青年团员，其中四个是在战斗中立过功劳的。他们如同接受了作战任务一样，都订了公约，并向党、团提出保证进行勤学苦练。一年之后，他们练成了一个优秀的棒球队，培养了自己百发百中的投球手邹国忠、龚廷清，和出色的接球手姜梦喜和张舒悫。一九五○年十月，这个年青的棒球队首次参加了北京市举行的体育大会，和军人组的五个棒球队比赛时得到了优胜。为了推动全军开展棒球运动，他们又在去年“五四”全军篮排球比赛大会上，举行了一次成功的表演。今年，他们以一个团的棒球队光荣地代表华北军区参加全军“八一”体育运动大会，并荣获冠军。
    这个光荣的棒球队，由于他们的示范作用和亲自到各个部队去推广教练的结果，对华北部队普遍开展棒球运动有很大贡献。在一九四九年和他们同时成立的棒球队，全华北军区只有三个，而现在每个团都有棒球队了。而在他们团里，每个连队甚至有两个棒球队，而且一般说都打得很好。棒球已经成为广大战士最爱好的一种体育活动了。
    开展棒球体育运动对于正规军人来说有很大意义，特别是使战士们锻炼坚强的体格和敏捷的动作。这个棒球班，战士们都喊他们为“大力士班”。有一次修礼堂，沉重的大石条四个人搬不动，他们两个队员就能抬起来飞跑。这“大力士班”还能以最迅速的动作来拆装武器。在学文化方面，由于他们精力充沛，成绩都是优良的。今年，这个棒球队里就产生了四个学习模范。正如棒球队长陈春兰在全军比赛荣获冠军之后所说：“我们不是单纯好玩，也不是为了争夺锦标，因为我们是人民的战士，在我们的肩上担负着光荣的使命。我们必须把自己锻炼成为无敌的勇士，保卫我们最可爱的祖国，保卫我们人民美好的生活！”    （新华社）
