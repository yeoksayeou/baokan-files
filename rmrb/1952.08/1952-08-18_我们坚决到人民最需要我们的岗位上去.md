    We are determined to go to the posts where the people need us most
    Editor: After reading the Central Personnel Department’s plan for unified allocation of university graduates based on the principle of "concentrated use and key allocation," we wholeheartedly support this wise decision and are determined to implement this plan with practical actions. New China is a country rich in organization and planning. The Party and the government have made precise and detailed plans for the overall and long-term interests of the country when allocating cadres in a planned and focused manner. Today, we have clearly realized that without the overall long-term interests, there is no personal interest or future to speak of. Unified allocation precisely demonstrates the care and importance the Party and the People's Government attach to us, placing us in the posts where the people need us most, enabling us to play the greatest role, and making us the most useful people. We must not fail the Party and the People's Government's cultivation and the ardent expectations of the people of our motherland.
    Over the past month, leading comrades have given us several reports, which have given us a clearer understanding of the magnificent construction of the motherland and the inevitable victory of Mao Zedong's cause. We thought: a large number of master machine tools must be manufactured in order to develop the motherland's heavy industry. Similarly, a large number of excellent people's teachers must be cultivated to nurture more construction cadres. As the People's Daily editorial stated, "Without educational construction, economic construction cannot develop alone." All graduating students of Beijing Normal University vow to accept the unified allocation of the People's Government with perseverance and joy, and dedicate all our strength to educating the new generation.
    We recognize that doing so is not only our glorious task but also our sacred right. All of our graduating students stated: We will not emphasize personal interests, we will not care about personal gains and losses, and we will actively meet new work tasks.
    Many students have sent letters of determination to the school: requesting to be assigned to remote areas, and to learn from outstanding people's education workers across the country, and strive to be models in teaching work.
    All Graduating Students of Beijing Normal University, 1952

### 我们坚决到人民最需要我们的岗位上去

    我们坚决到人民最需要我们的岗位上去
    编辑同志：看到中央人事部按照“集中使用、重点配备”的原则统一分配高等学校毕业生的方案以后，我们衷心拥护这一个英明的决定，并决心以实际行动来贯彻这一方案的实现。新中国是一个富于组织性和计划性的国家，党和政府有计划有重点地分配干部，对于国家整体及长远利益都作了精密和细致的打算。我们今天已经认识清楚：没有整体的长远的利益就谈不到什么个人的利益和前途。统一分配正说明党和人民政府对我们的爱护、重视，要把我们放到人民最需要的岗位上去，要我们发挥最大的作用，让我们成为最有用的人。我们绝不能辜负党和人民政府的培养和祖国人民对我们的殷切期望。
    一个多月来，领导同志们向我们作了好几个报告，使我们对祖国壮丽的建设，对毛泽东事业的胜利的必然性，有了更明确的认识。我们想到：必须制造大批工作母机，才能发展祖国的重工业，同样，必须培养大批优秀人民教师才能哺育更多的建设干部。诚如人民日报社论所说“没有教育建设，经济建设也不可能单独发展”，我们北京师范大学全体毕业同学誓以坚毅的精神，愉快地接受人民政府的统一分配，为教育新的一代而献出一切力量。
    我们认识到：这样作不但是我们光荣的任务，而且是我们神圣的权利。我们全体毕业同学表示：不强调个人兴趣，不计较个人得失，积极迎接新的工作任务。
    不少同学向校方送去了决心书：要求分发到边远地区去，并要向全国优秀的人民教育工作者学习，在教学工作中争取作模范。
    北京师范大学一九五二年全体毕业同学
