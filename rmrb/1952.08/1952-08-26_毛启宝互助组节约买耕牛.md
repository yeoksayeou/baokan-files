    Mao Qibao Mutual Aid Team Saves Money to Buy Oxen

    Editor: The Mao Qibao Mutual Aid Team in Xidu Township, District One, Hengyang County, is one of the better teams in the township. On the evening of August 11th, the whole team met to discuss ways to save money during the autumn harvest. Initially, some members disagreed, feeling that "after working hard all year, and finally seeing the harvest, even if we don't hold a big feast, we should still eat some good meals." However, most members believed that they should save. In the end, everyone decided to contribute 3,000 yuan per person per day (buying three catties of rice only costs 2,100 yuan, leaving 900 yuan for vegetables). Whoever's field is being harvested will be responsible for the meals. In this way, they saved 954,000 yuan compared to when they used to have especially good meals during harvest.

    When deciding what to do with this money, some members suggested buying clothes, while others suggested building a thatched hut as a meeting room. Team leader Mao Qibao said, "We didn't complete the rice planting plan on time this year, mainly because we suffered from waiting for oxen to plow the fields." Everyone agreed that he was right and decided to buy a large ox.

### 毛启宝互助组节约买耕牛

    毛启宝互助组节约买耕牛
    编辑同志：衡阳县一区西渡乡毛启宝互助组是全乡比较好的一个组。八月十一日晚，全组开会商议了在秋收期间的节约问题。开始个别组员不同意，他们觉得“一年累到头，好容易望到收获，即使不办‘五酒四饭’，也应该吃几顿好饮食。”但大部分组员认为应该节省。最后大家决定每人每天凑三千元（买三斤米只需二千一百元，还有九百元买菜），在谁家“杀禾”（即收割），就托谁家代办伙食。这样一来，比过去“杀禾”特别吃好饭时节省人民币九十五万四千元。
    决定这笔钱的用途时，有的组员主张买衣服穿，有的主张架一间茅屋作会议室。组长毛启宝说：“我们今年没有如期完成插秧计划，主要是吃了等牛犁田的亏。”大家听了很对，决定买一头大黄牛。
