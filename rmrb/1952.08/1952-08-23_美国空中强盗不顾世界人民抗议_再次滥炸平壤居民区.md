　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 22nd. American aerial bandits, disregarding the opposition and protests of kind people all over the world, once again conducted a planned and barbarous bombing of residential areas in Pyongyang. A squadron of approximately 30 American B-29 bombers indiscriminately bombed the western and northern districts of Pyongyang for six hours, starting from 9:35 PM on the 20th. This area, which has no military targets, had already been largely reduced to ruins after continuous frenzied bombing and burning by American planes on July 11th, August 4th, and August 10th. However, the murderously inclined American aerial bandits were still unwilling to spare the surviving peaceful residents, the few intact residences, and the mud houses awaiting repair. They once again dropped more than 1,500 bombs, incendiary bombs, and time bombs on this area, killing more than 240 elderly people, women, and children; burning down more than 950 civilian houses and mud dwellings; and destroying 13,000 pyong of cultivated land full of crops in the northern district. Longxingli, and Kanxing Third and Fourth Villages in the western district, where there were the most houses and the highest density of residents, were subjected to twelve concentrated bombings in succession. The First Municipal Hospital, bookstore, and schools in the western district of Pyongyang were all destroyed by American aerial bandits as targets for cruel destruction. Together, internal affairs members and People's Air Defense self-defense team members of Pyongyang City were dispatched, risking their lives, to rescue more than 200 citizens buried in the rubble of the disaster area.

    The recent series of brutal and bloody crimes committed by American invading bandits, who frantically bombed and strafed residential areas in Pyongyang and massacred peaceful residents in large numbers, completely exposed the truth about the plan shamelessly clamored by the U.S. Fifth Air Force Command to destroy 78 "military targets" in North Korea. The American invaders' evil plan is to use their brutal force to destroy peaceful cities and towns, and to massacre peaceful residents in large numbers, in order to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations and expand the war. This kind of extremely ferocious and bloody atrocity has aroused the Korean people's unparalleled anger and hatred. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the appeal of the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front and are determined to fight to the end, together with progressive people all over the world, to crush the aggressors' evil conspiracy.

    美国空中强盗不顾世界人民抗议
    再次滥炸平壤居民区
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】美国空中强盗不顾全世界善良人民的反对和抗议，又一次对平壤市居民聚集地区，进行有计划的野蛮轰炸。美国B—29型轰炸机编队约三十架，从二十日下午九时三十五分起，彻夜滥炸平壤市西区和北区一带达六小时之久。这个毫无军事目标的地区，在七月十一日、八月四日、八月十日连续遭美国飞机疯狂炸射和焚烧以后，大部已成废墟，但是嗜杀成性的美国空中强盗，仍不肯放过劫后余生的和平居民和少数完整的住所以及正待修建的土窟民房，又一次在这个地区投掷了一千五百多颗炸弹、烧夷弹和定时炸弹，杀害了老弱妇孺二百四十多人；烧毁民房、土窟九百五十多所，并破坏了北区一万三千坪长满庄稼的产地。房舍最多、居民最稠密的西区龙兴里和坎兴三里、四里等地，连续遭到十二次的集中轰炸。平壤市西区的第一市立医院和书店、学校，都被美国空中强盗当成残酷破坏的目标而加以毁灭。平壤市的内务员们和人民防空自卫队员们一起，星夜出动，冒险抢救了灾区埋在土堆里奄奄一息的市民二百多人。
    最近期间美国侵略强盗狂炸滥射平壤居民区，大量屠杀和平居民的一连串残暴血腥罪行事实，完全暴露了美国第五航空队司令部所无耻叫嚣的破坏朝鲜北部七十八个“军事目标”的计划真相。美国侵略者的罪恶计划就是以其残暴力量毁灭和平城乡，大量屠杀和平居民，以便破坏朝鲜停战谈判，扩大战争。这种穷凶极恶的血腥暴行，激起了朝鲜人民的无比愤怒和敌忾，他们一致表示坚决拥护朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线的呼吁书，决心和全世界进步人类一道，为粉碎侵略者的罪恶阴谋而斗争到底。
