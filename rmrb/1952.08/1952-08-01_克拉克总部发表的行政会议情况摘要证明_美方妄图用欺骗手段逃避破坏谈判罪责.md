Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 31st: The US side is now desperately trying to evade responsibility for bringing the Korean armistice negotiations back to a standstill. On the very day that Harrison fled the public meeting of both delegations, Clark Headquarters in Tokyo issued a summary of the 18 days of administrative meetings. Of course, anyone hoping to find in this lengthy article the so-called "sincerity" in seeking an armistice that the US side claimed to possess on July 1st would be sorely disappointed. However, from this summary, one can see how the US side, taking advantage of the confidentiality of the administrative meetings, exhausted all means in a futile attempt to induce the Korean and Chinese side to accept their unreasonable demand for forcibly retaining prisoners of war.

The US side's summary shows that the US side consistently adhered to the so-called "non-forcible repatriation" principle throughout the administrative meetings. Needless to say, this is merely another way of phrasing the already bankrupt so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle. The US side's principle is inconsistent with both the principle of promptly releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war held by both sides after the armistice, as stipulated in Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement, and the principles of the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. To put it bluntly, the US side's so-called principle is that they must forcibly detain a large number of our prisoners of war. This clearly completely violates their promise made on July 1st to negotiate in accordance with the principles of Article 51 of the draft agreement.

In order to force the Korean and Chinese side to accept this extremely unreasonable principle, the US side resorted to all sorts of tricks in the administrative meetings. From the US side's summary, it can be seen that the US side adopted two different attitudes before and after proposing the unreasonable plan to repatriate only 83,000 of our personnel on July 13th. Before July 13th, the US side tried everything possible to lure our side into its trap, in the words of Clark Headquarters in the summary, to seek "gaps" in our suggestions, attempting to retain as many of our prisoners of war as possible. After July 13th, the US side had exhausted its schemes and was met with our side's stern refutation and exposure, so the US side adopted an attitude of refusing to negotiate and delaying negotiations.

On the first day of the administrative meetings, the US side asked our side to explain "how [we] understand" Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement, attempting to induce our side to deviate from the principle of prisoner repatriation stipulated in Article 51 in order to pave the way for the US side to forcibly retain prisoners of war. Of course, as Clark Headquarters admitted in the summary, this move "did not succeed" and instead suffered a severe blow from our side. Then, the US side expressed its willingness to consider making administrative changes to the names and categories of captured personnel, attempting to exclude a large number of our captured personnel from being counted as prisoners of war so that the US side could arbitrarily detain them. After General Nam Il reiterated our side's principle of prisoner repatriation based on Articles 51 and 52 of the draft agreement on July 6th, Harrison shamelessly asked our side on July 7th: "Since your side's principle is to be implemented, and you insist that we return 20,000 Chinese prisoners to your control, how do you plan to reconcile this contradiction?" Anyone with a little rationality knows that it is Harrison himself who should answer this question. As long as Harrison abandons his unreasonable demand that violates the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, this contradiction can be resolved immediately. Harrison, who regards the issue of prisoner repatriation as a human trafficking deal, attempted to use this shameless trick to induce our side to haggle with him. Needless to say, Harrison's move failed again.

Harrison was clearly unwilling to give up his tricks. He even further attempted to fabricate fake repatriation lists to deceive and perfunctorily deal with the situation. On July 8th, Harrison asked our side if we had any intention that "the list could include the names of Chinese prisoners to be repatriated at the exchange location, and also the names of Chinese prisoners who would be released on oath (according to Article 52) without being brought to Panmunjom." That is to say, to have our side agree to the US side detaining our prisoners of war through "release on oath." However, people know that Article 21 of the Geneva Convention clearly stipulates that the method of "release on oath" must be adopted only if the laws and consent of the prisoner of war's home country allow and agree, and if the prisoner of war is not forced to accept it. Since neither Korea nor China has such legal provisions, nor have they agreed to the US side doing so, the US side has no basis to adopt this provision. General Nam Il gave the US side a strong refutation of this in his speech on July 18th. On July 10th, Harrison began to "explore the classification of 'escapees'." The US side insisted that our side had mentioned on December 30th of last year and January 3rd of this year that escapees could not be repatriated, which is a complete lie. The US side's purpose is to attempt to use "escape" as an excuse to forcibly detain our prisoners of war. General Nam Il later revealed that the so-called "escaped" prisoners of war in Harrison's mouth were actually those who had been detained by the US side and forcibly used as US spies. This completely exposed the US side's shameless face.

After all these tricks failed, the US side proposed an unreasonable plan to repatriate 83,000 of our personnel on the 13th. Our side pointed out on the 18th that the US side's plan violates the principles stipulated in Articles 51 and 52 of the armistice agreement, does not conform to our side's realistic repatriation figure of nearly 110,000 people, including 20,000 Chinese volunteer prisoners of war, based on the principle of classification, and also harbors ulterior motives, and therefore cannot be accepted by our side. After this, the US side adopted an attitude of refusing to negotiate, unreasonably repeating that their plan was "firm, final, and unchangeable." Harrison simply repeated an old saying at meetings for many consecutive days: "I have nothing to say." They hoped to hide behind the confidential nature of the meeting and drag it on day after day, so that they could both achieve the goal of delaying the armistice negotiations and avoid being condemned by the people of the world.

Regarding the meetings after July 13th, Clark Headquarters obviously has nothing to say, just like Harrison. However, Clark Headquarters still made despicable provocations in the summary. It is already very clear that after failing to force our side to accept its unreasonable plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the American aggressors vainly attempted to undermine the brotherly unity of the Chinese and Korean people through shameless provocations. This is completely daydreaming. General Nam Il sternly exposed this conspiracy in his speech on July 25th. The historical fact is that the Korean and Chinese people will never accept any unreasonable plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war, whether it is so-called "military pressure," or deception and blackmail, or provocative conspiracies, cannot change our side's firm position in the slightest. Any means of deceiving and obscuring the facts cannot allow the US side to shirk its responsibility for delaying and undermining the armistice negotiations.

### 克拉克总部发表的行政会议情况摘要证明  美方妄图用欺骗手段逃避破坏谈判罪责

    克拉克总部发表的行政会议情况摘要证明
    美方妄图用欺骗手段逃避破坏谈判罪责
    【新华社开城三十一日电】美方现在竭力企图逃避他们使朝鲜停战谈判重新陷于僵局的责任。就在哈利逊从双方代表团公开会议上逃走的那一天，东京的克拉克总部发表了一篇关于十八天行政性会议情况的摘要。当然，谁如果要想从这篇冗长的文章里找到美方在七月一日所曾经声言过的所谓觅求停战的“诚意”，那是会大失所望的。但是从这篇摘要中，人们可以看到美方怎样利用行政会议的秘密性，用尽各种手段来徒劳地企图诱使朝中方面接受他们的强迫扣留战俘的无理主张。
    美方的摘要表明：美方在行政性会议中自始至终坚持着所谓“不强迫遣返”战俘的原则。不用说，这不过是早就破产了的所谓“自愿遣返”原则的另
    一种说法而已。美方的这个原则既不合乎停战协定草案第五十一款所规定的停战以后尽速释放和遣返双方所收容的全部战俘的原则，也不合乎一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约的原则。如果直截了当地说，那末，美方的所谓原则，就是他们一定要强迫扣留大批我方战俘。这显然完全违背了他们在七月一日所作的按照协定草案第五十一款的原则进行协商的诺言。
    为了强使中朝方面接受这个极端无理的原则，美方在行政性会议上大耍手腕。从美方这篇摘要里可以看出来，美方在七月十三日提出仅仅遣返我方八万三千人的无理方案之前和以后，采取了两种不同的态度。在七月十三日以前，美方想尽一切办法来使我方上他的圈套，用克拉克总部在摘要中的话来说，就是找寻我方建议中的“空隙”，企图尽可能多扣留我方战俘。在七月十三日以后，美方的计谋已经用尽，而且遭到了我方的严正驳斥和揭露，于是美方采取了拒绝协商、拖延谈判的态度。
    在行政性会议的第一天，美方就要求我方解释我方对停战协定草案第五十一款“如何了解”，企图诱使我方背离第五十一款所规定的遣俘原则，来为美方强迫扣留战俘铺平道路，当然，如克拉克总部在摘要里所承认的，这一着“没有成功”，反而遭到了我方严正的打击。接着美方又表示愿意考虑对被俘人员名称和类别作行政性的改动，企图把大批我方被俘人员不算作战俘，以便让美方任意扣留。在南日将军七月六日重申我方根据协定草案第五十一款、五十二款提出的遣俘原则以后，哈利逊在七月七日又无耻地向我方探听说：“我方的原则既要实施，而你方又坚持要我方将两万名中国俘虏归回你方控制之下，这种矛盾你方打算怎样调和起来呢？”任何稍有理性的人一看就知道，应该回答这个问题的恰恰就是哈利逊自己。只要哈利逊放弃他那个违反一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约的无理主张，这个矛盾立刻就可以解决。把遣返战俘问题当成人口买卖的哈利逊，企图用这种无耻伎俩来诱使我方和他讨价还价。用不着说，哈利逊的这一着又失败了。
    哈利逊显然还不肯放弃他的诡计。他竟进一步企图制造假的遣返名单来欺骗和搪塞。七月八日，哈利逊询问我方是否有这样的意思，就是“名单上可以有要在交换地点遣返的中国俘虏的名字，也可以有不必带到板门店而（按照第五十二款）宣誓释放的中国俘虏的名字”。这就是说，要我方同意美方经“宣誓释放”而扣留我方战俘。但是，人们知道，日内瓦公约二十一条明明规定，“宣誓释放”的办法必须在战俘所属国家的法律允许和同意及并非强令战俘接受的情况下方得采取，而朝中两国既没有这样的法律规定，也没有同意美方这样做，因此美方没有任何根据采用这条规定。关于这一点，南日将军在七月十八日的发言中，已经给予美方有力的驳斥。七月十日，哈利逊又开始“探讨关于
    ‘逃亡者’的分类”。美方硬说我方在去年十二月三十日和今年一月三日曾提过逃亡者可以不遣返，这完全是撒谎。美方的目的是企图用“逃亡”作为藉口来强迫扣留我方战俘。南日将军后来揭发了哈利逊嘴里的所谓“逃亡”了的我方被俘人员，原来是被美方扣留下来强迫充当了美方的特务。这就使美方的无耻嘴脸完全暴露了出来。
    在这一切诡计都破产以后，美方在十三日提出了遣返我方八万三千人的无理方案。我方在十八日指出美方这个方案既违反停战协定第五十一款和五十二款所规定的原则，又不合于我方根据分类原则所要求的包括两万志愿军战俘在内并接近十一万人的切合实际的遣俘概数，而且还包藏着不可告人的祸心，因而是我方所绝对不能接受的。在此以后，美方就采取了拒绝协商的态度，蛮不讲理地重复说他们的方案是“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”。哈利逊在连续许多天的会议上只是重复一句老话：“我无话可说。”他们希望就这样躲在这个会议的秘密性质后面一天又一天地拖下去，这样就既可以达到拖延停战谈判的目的，又可以不致于受到全世界人民的斥责。
    对于七月十三日以后的会议，克拉克总部显然和哈利逊一样，已经无话可说了。但是克拉克总部在摘要中还来作卑鄙的挑拨。事情已经很清楚，美国侵略者在无法迫使我方接受其强迫扣留战俘的无理方案以后，就妄想用无耻的挑拨来破坏中朝人民的兄弟般的团结。这完全是在白日作梦。南日将军在七月二十五日的发言中已经严正地揭露了这个阴谋。历史的事实是：朝中人民绝不接受任何强迫扣留战俘的无理方案，无论是所谓“军事压力”，无论是欺骗讹诈，无论是挑拨阴谋，都不能丝毫改变我方的坚定立场。任何欺骗和蒙蔽事实的手法，都不能使美方推卸它拖延和破坏停战谈判的罪责。
