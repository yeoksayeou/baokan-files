    CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau Propaganda Department
    Circular on the Experience of Political Theory Study by Senior Cadres of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department
    The Northeast People's Government Industry Department's senior cadres' theoretical study has been ongoing since the beginning of 1950. They have studied "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" (New Economic Policy period), "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" (sections directly related to current work); "The Communist Manifesto," "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific;" and after July 1, 1951, began studying Party history and the eight conditions for Party membership. After the publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," they immediately organized the study of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" article by article. Theoretical study was interrupted during the "Three-Anti" movement, but they studied relevant policy instructions on "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Since May of this year, theoretical study has resumed, mainly focusing on Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction."
    Their study organization has two parts. One part is based on the department as a study unit, with cadres above the level of division chief within the department and the directors of various bureaus in Shenyang forming a small group, led by the director of the office. The other part consists of each bureau in Shenyang establishing a study unit, with cadres above the level of division chief in the bureau organizing a study group, led by the bureau director. In total, more than fifty cadres at the bureau and division chief level participated in the study. Over the course of more than two years of study, significant achievements have been made:
    First, a learning system has been maintained. The theoretical study of senior cadres of the Industry Department has persisted for more than two years since 1950, basically adhering to the weekly study day and time. They study every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon and Tuesday and Friday evenings for two hours each, totaling twelve hours of study per week. Only when work tasks are heavy are study sessions temporarily reduced. This fact shows that the excuse of "being too busy with work to study" often given in the past is untenable. Although some senior cadres do face some difficulties in terms of study time due to heavy workloads, these difficulties can be completely overcome and the conflict between work and study time can be appropriately resolved as long as they persevere.
    Second, a climate of conscious study has been established. Senior cadres' study of Marxism-Leninism mainly relies on self-study; therefore, this kind of study must have a higher degree of consciousness. However, some comrades' consciousness cannot be cultivated all at once and requires a relatively long period of effort. The situation in the Industry Department is no exception. When they initially organized the study, they strongly emphasized study discipline, established a sign-in and leave system, and criticized those who were absent without reason. The minister personally supervised the process. Experience has shown that this approach was entirely necessary at the beginning. Only after this stage, when everyone has gradually realized the role of study from their work, can they gradually deepen their understanding of the importance of theoretical study and gradually study consciously. Now, most leading comrades in the Industry Department can seize the time to study and often look for reference books. For example, when studying "On Contradiction," many comrades studied Stalin's "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics." The study of Soviet treatises on advanced science in industrial construction is even more widespread.
    Third, work has improved by combining theory with business and ideological viewpoints. In terms of guiding ideology, they regard studying theory as a weapon for understanding the laws of things and guiding work, and connect it with solving problems in their work. The theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industry Department has indeed solved many problems in their own work over the past two years, which is also a significant gain from their study. From the transition from the New Record Movement to the establishment of production responsibility systems, technical management, economic accounting, and from the restoration of production to capital construction, many comrades have gained clearer understanding and deeper insights after studying at each stage of the transition and on some of the issues within each stage. For example, in 1950, when the leadership proposed establishing a production responsibility system to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible for production management, although cadres generally recognized this, some comrades opposed relying on the working class, democratic management, and the factory director responsibility system. Some comrades did not initially realize in their minds that production could not be improved without relying on the working class and that the factory director responsibility system was essentially responsible to the working class. More than two years of experience has shown that the process of study is a process of continuously correcting incorrect ideas and improving ideological levels. Therefore, the planning of work in the department has improved significantly as a result of studying political theory. For example, in this year's increase production and practice economy movement, many bureaus had already made preparations ideologically and organizationally. The methods and steps proposed when formulating the increase production and practice economy plan were also clear and specific, so the increase production and practice economy plan was easily implemented after discussion by employees. In the past, some bureaus haggled over the execution of tasks and emphasized difficulties. Now, not only has this situation changed, but there have also been many improvements in the work.
    The significant achievements in the theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industry Department are mainly due to the following two reasons:
    First, the attention and determination of the main leading cadres are important conditions for doing a good job in study. First of all, the leadership has always regarded leading study as an important part of leading work. Work and study are not opposed to each other, but unified. Because leading industrial production is a very complicated task and a new topic for many comrades, "study, study, and study again" is even more important. The Industry Department leadership encourages cadres to study technology (because this is a very important issue in industrial construction), but also points out that if only technical study is pursued without simultaneously studying economic theory and political theory, without studying Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, the entire work cannot move forward, and deviations may even occur due to a failure to comprehend Party policies. Especially for leading cadres, if they do not study theory, it is impossible to understand and master the laws of development in industrial construction, thereby guiding our industrial construction and pushing it forward. The experience of the Industry Department proves that only by studying theory can we gradually learn how to grasp the main problems and key problems in our work, so as to appropriately arrange these problems and solve them correctly. Only by studying theory can we gradually improve work efficiency, and only then can we break away from busy affairs and solve key problems.
    In the theoretical study of the Industry Department, the main leading cadres can set an example. The minister and vice ministers often participate in the study, and the leadership provides guidance or answers to the difficult questions raised during the study. This not only vigorously promoted the study of senior cadres within the department and the study of its subordinate bureaus (such as the Machinery, Electricity, Electrical Engineering, and Light Industry Bureaus, which are units with better study), but also greatly improved the cadres' enthusiasm and confidence in learning, and continuously improved the cadres' theoretical level.
    The attention and determination of leading cadres are very important. With it, study discipline can be easily implemented and study can be sustained.
    Second, striving to connect with reality in study, giving play to the guiding role of theory in work, and gradually improving cadres' understanding and interest in theoretical study are the central links in doing a good job in study.
    The Industry Department conscientiously implements the principle of "unity of learning and application," so that study is linked to reality, opposing rote memorization of books. They recognize that Marxist-Leninist theory is not a ready-made prescription, it can only give us the viewpoints and methods for understanding and solving problems. The most fundamental problem in linking theory with practice lies in understanding and mastering the Marxist viewpoint and method to analyze and solve problems. Therefore, the Industry Department leadership regards the study of basic theory as a fundamental method for unifying cadres' thinking, methods, and viewpoints, thereby unifying the pace of work to implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, as well as improving the fundamental methods of cadres in service.
    In their theoretical study, on the one hand, they often seize prominent problems in their work and use the weapon of theory to analyze them and resolve the contradictions within them. At the same time, they focus on the problems of cadres' ideological understanding, such as the issue of industrial investment, which is related to the entire policy of developing industry. However, in the past, various departments often emphasized their own needs, and from the surface, it seemed that "there were sufficient reasons to convince people." However, these opinions that seemed "reasonable" from a local or superficial perspective were often observed in isolation from the Party's general policy of developing industry. If ideological understanding is not improved, and a unified understanding is not sought in terms of ideological methods, then these seemingly "reasonable" local viewpoints are difficult to overcome and persuade. During the study of "On Contradiction," due to the leadership's enlightenment, many cadres realized the significance of solving the main contradiction, grasping the main contradiction, and grasping the main problems. Therefore, many comrades realized that the reason why it was easy to waver in grasping plans in the past was because they were not clear enough about how to implement the key issues in the development of industry in the actual execution of the plan. The responsible comrades of each unit changed the practice of only seeking investment for their own departments without considering the overall situation. In this way, unified ideological understanding also unified the pace of work. The same was true in the issue of capital construction. When the basic construction of industry has been put in the first place, it is necessary to concentrate and strengthen this work with great efforts. In the process of implementation, some units are unwilling to transfer cadres or unwilling to transfer good cadres, while the study of "On Contradiction" helped the leadership to solve this problem smoothly. In addition, some comrades only pay attention to the future direction in capital construction and are divorced from the actual situation. For example, in the construction of basic construction, they only see that they should move towards the fixed worker system, the factory construction, etc., but not pay enough attention to the poor engineering quality caused by the lack of technical responsibility system. Some comrades only pay attention to the present and cannot see the future development direction, so they are conservative in many work policies. After the study of "On Contradiction," the problem of "the relationship between today and tomorrow" was initially clarified.
    The experience of theoretical study in the Industry Department proves that theoretical study must be linked to reality, and in linking with reality, linking with thought and linking with work is a unified and inseparable whole.
    In terms of learning methods, the Industry Department often adopts informal talks and free debates to achieve the goal of exchanging ideas and unifying understanding. For some incorrect opinions, they do not adopt dogmatic criticism or label them, but seek solutions in the debate of problems. Although this learning method is not the only complete method, it is a pragmatic method for solving problems in the current situation.
    The experience of senior cadres in the Industry Department in conducting theoretical study has specifically illustrated the importance of theoretical study and the possibility of doing a good job in theoretical study. Especially after the great victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, the political and ideological level of cadres has greatly improved, and the enthusiasm for studying political theory has also greatly increased, creating extremely favorable conditions for systematic political theory study. At present, the Northeast is facing large-scale economic construction with key points, and new things are constantly emerging. Systematic study of Marxist-Leninist theory, study of Mao Zedong Thought, and study of economic knowledge by the whole Party is even more important. The theoretical study of senior cadres in the Industry Department has provided us with a good experience.

    关于东北人民政府工业部高级干部政治理论学习的经验通报
    东北人民政府工业部高级干部理论学习，从一九五○年初开始一直坚持到现在，共学习了“联共（布）党史简明教程”（新经济政策时期），“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”（与当前工作直接有关的部分）；“共产党宣言”、“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”，一九五一年“七一”后开始学习党史及党员标准的八个条件；“毛泽东选集”出版后即组织逐篇学习“毛泽东选集”；“三反”运动中理论学习虽中断，但学习了有关“三反”“五反”的政策指示；自今年五月起，又恢复理论学习，主要是学习了毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”。
    他们的学习组织有两个部分，一部分是以部为学习单位，由部内处长以上干部及在沈阳的各局局长成立一小组，由办公室主任担任组长；另在沈阳的各局各成立一个学习单位，由局属处长以上干部组织学习小组，由局长任组长。参加学习的总计有局、处长以上干部五十多人，在两年多的学习过程中有了显著的成绩：
    第一、坚持了学习制度，工业部高级干部理论学习从一九五○年到现在，坚持了两年多，基本上坚持了每周的学习日和学习时间。他们每周星期三、星期六的整个下午和星期二、星期五的晚上各两小时都在进行学习，每周学习时间共十二小时，只有在工作任务繁忙时，才临时减少学习次数。这个事实表明了：过去有不少人所谓“工作忙没有时间学习”的借口是立不住脚的。虽然一部分高级干部，由于工作任务繁忙，在学习时间上的确有一些困难，但是，只要能坚持，这个困难就完全可以克服，工作和学习时间上的矛盾也可以获得适当的解决。
    第二、树立了自觉学习的风气。高级干部学习马克思列宁主义，基本上依靠自修，因此，这种学习就必须带有更高的自觉性。但有些同志的自觉性并不是一下子就可以养成的，须要经过一个较长期的努力过程，工业部的情形并不例外，他们开始组织学习时，曾十分强调了学习纪律，建立了签到和请假制度，无故不出席即要受到批评，部长并亲加督促。经验证明开始时这样作法是完全必要的，只有经过这一阶段之后，大家已逐步从工作中明显地体会到了学习的作用后，才能逐步加深对理论学习重要性的认识，也才能逐步自觉地学习。现在工业部多数负责同志，都能抓紧时间学习，并能经常找参考书，例如学习“矛盾论”时，许多同志学习了斯大林同志的“马克思主义与语言学问题”。至于学习苏联在工业建设上先进科学的论著则更为普遍。
    第三、结合业务和思想观点，提高了工作。在领导思想上，他们把学习理论当作认识事物规律和指导工作的武器，联系解决工作中的问题。工业部高级干部理论学习，两年多来确曾解决了他们自己工作中的许多问题，这也是他们学习的重要收获。从新纪录运动转入建立生产责任制、技术管理、经济核算及由恢复生产转到基本建设，每个阶段的转变及每个阶段内的一些问题，不少同志都是经过学习后才更加认识明确和体会深刻的。例如：一九五○年，当领导上提出建立生产责任制以消灭生产管理上的无人负责现象时，在干部中虽然一般地认识到了，但有的同志却把依靠工人阶级、民主管理和厂长负责制对立起来，有的同志开始并没有在思想上真正认识到不依靠工人阶级，就不能搞好生产，厂长负责制实质上就是对工人阶级负责。两年多的经验证明，学习的过程正是不断地纠正不正确思想的过程和提高思想水平的过程。因此，该部在学习政治理论中，工作的计划性有较显著的提高。例如今年的增产节约运动，很多局早就在思想上组织上作了准备，制订增产节约计划时，提出的方法和规定的步骤也都明确、具体，因而增产节约计划经过职工讨论后，就很容易贯彻。过去有的局在执行任务上，好讲价钱，强调困难，现在不仅改变了这种情况，而且工作也有了许多改进。
    工业部高级干部理论学习所以能有较显著的成绩，主要有以下两个原因：
    一、主要领导干部的重视和决心，是搞好学习的重要条件。首先，领导上始终把领导学习看作是领导工作的重要部分，工作和学习并不是对立的，而是统一的。由于领导工业生产是一个十分复杂的任务，对于许多同志来说都是一个新的课题，“学习，学习，再学习”，就更有它的重要意义。工业部领导上一方面鼓励干部学习技术（因为这是工业建设中一个非常重要的问题），一方面又指出如果只有技术学习，而不同时钻研经济理论和政治理论，不研究马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想，则整个工作不能前进，甚至不能体会党的政策而发生偏向；特别是领导干部，如果不学习理论，就不可能懂得与掌握工业建设中的发展规律，从而去指导我们的工业建设并把它推向前进。工业部的经验证明：只有学习理论，才能够逐渐学会如何抓住工作中的主要问题、关键问题，从而去恰当地安排这些问题和正确地解决这些问题。也只有学习理论，才能够逐渐提高工作效能，也才能够从繁忙的事务里摆脱出来，解决关键问题。
    工业部在理论学习中，主要的领导干部都能以身作则，部长、副部长都经常参加学习，学习中提出的疑难问题，领导上随时指导大家研究或给以解答。这样，不仅有力地推动了部内高级干部的学习，推动了所属各局的学习（如机械、电业、电工、轻工业等局，都是学习较好的单位），而且也大大提高了干部的学习热情和信心，使干部的理论水平不断提高。
    领导干部的重视和决心，是十分重要的，有了它，学习纪律才容易贯彻，学习也才能坚持。
    二、在学习中力求联系实际，发挥理论对工作的指导作用，逐步提高干部对理论学习的认识和兴趣，这是搞好学习的中心环节。
    工业部的学习认真执行了“学用一致”的原则，使学习联系实际，反对照搬书本；他们认识到马克思列宁主义理论并不是一个现成药方，它只能给我们以认识问题和解决问题的观点和方法。理论与实际联系，最根本的问题在于懂得和掌握马克思主义的观点、方法，去分析问题和解决问题。因此，工业部领导上，把学习基础理论作为统一干部思想、方法、观点从而统一工作步调以贯彻党的方针路线以及提高在职干部的根本方法。
    他们在理论学习中，一方面经常抓住工作中突出的问题，以理论的武器去分析它，解决其中的矛盾，同时，又着重注意干部思想认识上的问题，如工业投资问题，这是关系着发展工业的整个方针问题，但过去各部门往往强调本部门的需要，而且从表面看似乎“都有足以说服人的理由”，可是这种从局部看或从表面看来似乎“都有理由”的意见，常常是从离开党发展工业的总方针而孤立观察的，如果不在思想上提高，不在思想方法上求得一致的认识，则这种似乎“有理由”的局部观点很难克服与说服。在“矛盾论”学习的过程中，由于领导上的启发，许多干部体会到必须解决主要矛盾，抓住主要矛盾，抓住主要问题的意义，因而使许多同志认识到过去掌握计划上所以容易摇摆，就因为对于如何在实际执行计划中对贯彻发展工业的重点问题还不够明确，使各单位负责同志转变了不照顾全局只为本部门争投资的作法，这样，统一了思想认识，也就统一了工作步调。在基本建设问题上也有同样情形，当工业的基本建设已提到了首位，必须以极大力量集中加强这一工作的时候，在执行中有的单位却不愿抽干部或者不愿意抽好的干部，而“矛盾论”的学习，帮助了领导上顺利地解决了这个问题。此外，有的同志在基本建设中只注意于将来的方向而与现实情况脱节，如基本建设中的施工，只看到将来应该走向工人固定化、施工工厂化等方面，对现实存在的由于缺乏技术责任制而发生的工程质量低劣的问题却注意得不够；另有一些同志，只注意现在，看不到将来的发展方向，因此在许多工作方针上保守。经过“矛盾论”的学习，初步搞清了“今天与明天的关系”的问题。
    工业部理论学习的经验证明：理论学习必须联系实际，而联系实际中，联系思想、联系工作完全是一个统一的不可分割的整体。
    工业部在学习方法上，经常采取漫谈、自由争辩来达到交流思想、统一认识的目的，对于某些错误的意见，也不是采取武断式的批评或者去扣帽子，而是在对问题的争辩中去求得解决。这种学习方法虽然不是唯一的完整的方法，但却在目前情况下是实事求是的、解决问题的方法。
    工业部高级干部进行理论学习的经验，已具体地说明了理论学习的重要性，和搞好理论学习的可能性。特别是“三反”运动的伟大胜利后，干部的政治思想水平有了很大的提高，学习政治理论的热情也大大提高，给系统的政治理论学习创造了极为有利的条件。目前东北正面临着有重点的大规模经济建设，新的事物不断出现，全党系统地学习马克思列宁主义理论，学习毛泽东思想，学习经济知识就更显得重要。工业部高级干部的理论学习已给我们提供了一个良好的经验。
