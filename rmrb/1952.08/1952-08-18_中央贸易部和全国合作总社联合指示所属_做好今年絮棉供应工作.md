The Central Ministry of Trade and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives jointly issued instructions to their subordinates to improve the supply of floss cotton this year and stabilize floss cotton prices. In August and September of last year, due to insufficient supply of floss cotton, speculators took the opportunity to drive up prices, and floss cotton prices fluctuated for a time. Later, state-owned trading departments, in conjunction with cooperatives, vigorously transferred and supplied the cotton, and prices dropped to a reasonable level in early October. In order to prevent this situation from happening again this year, the Central Ministry of Trade and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have formulated specific plans for the amount of floss cotton supplied in various regions, and required that all regions complete the transfer and transportation before mid-August, so as to timely process the floss and prevent supply interruptions. The instructions stipulate that local cotton yarn and cloth companies should be responsible for immediately allocating a large amount of coarse lint and some yellow cotton, which are most suitable for floss use, to cooperatives, department stores, and retail companies for processing and supplying directly to consumers. This year, the sales prices of floss cotton in various regions will be uniformly controlled by the local trade administrative departments, and in principle, will be slightly lower than the prices stabilized after October last year. In order to fully supply the needs of the masses for floss cotton, private merchants and peddlers in non-cotton producing areas may carry out trafficking under the leadership and organization of the trade administrative departments. Under the conditions of very stable national financial and commodity prices, as long as all regions do a good job in supplying floss cotton, floss cotton prices can be completely stabilized.

    做好今年絮棉供应工作
    中央贸易部和全国合作总社联合指示所属做好今年絮棉供应工作，稳定絮棉价格。去年八、九月间因絮棉供应不足，投机商贩曾乘机哄抬价格，絮棉价格一度发生波动，后经国营贸易部门结合合作社大力调运供应，十月初价格才降至合理水平。今年为了防止这一情况的发生，中央贸易部和合作总社对各地絮棉供应数量，均制订了具体计划，并要求各地在八月半以前调运完毕，以便及时弹制熟絮，不使供应发生脱节现象。指示中规定各地花纱布公司应负责将最适于絮用的大量粗绒及部分黄花，即时拨给合作社、百货公司、零售公司，加工弹制，直接供应消费者。今年各地的絮棉销售价格，由当地贸易行政部门统一掌握，原则上比去年十月份稳定后的价格稍低一些。为了充分供应群众絮棉的需要，非产棉区的私商小贩，可在贸易行政部门的领导组织下进行贩运。在全国金融物价十分稳定的条件下，只要各地做好絮棉供应工作，絮棉价格是完全可以稳定的。
