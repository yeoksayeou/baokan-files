Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, August 1st: The General Committee of the International Red Cross Conference discussed the issue of ratifying, popularizing, and implementing the Geneva Conventions at its July 30th meeting. At the meeting on the 30th, Su Jingguan, the chief representative of the Chinese government delegation, spoke, condemning the crimes of the U.S. interventionists in slaughtering and mistreating prisoners of war, indiscriminately bombing and massacring peaceful residents, and even conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. He pointed out that these crimes seriously violated the Geneva Conventions and contravened the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross. Su Jingguan proposed a motion calling on national Red Cross societies to mobilize world public opinion to demand an immediate end to all atrocities violating the Geneva Conventions occurring in Korea.

Kim Min-san, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, delivered a speech at the meeting in angry tones, filled with factual evidence, exposing the U.S. interventionist army's atrocities in Korea that violated the Geneva Conventions. Spreading germ-carrying insects, torturing and slaughtering prisoners of war, refusing to repatriate prisoners of war, indiscriminately bombing civilians—these acts all proved their serious violation of the basic principles that the Red Cross must concentrate its efforts to defend. The condemnations by the Chinese and Korean representatives clearly caused great panic among the U.S. representative and its lackeys. The chairman of the International Red Cross Conference, Macaulay (Canada), repeatedly interrupted the speeches of the Chinese and Korean representatives; he even prevented the Korean representative from finishing his speech. Sandström (Sweden), Chairman of the Board of Governors of the League of Red Cross Societies, also arbitrarily proposed that the chairman prohibit these speeches in the future. Polish representative Domańska, in her speech, cited more facts that she had personally witnessed in Korea regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by the U.S. military. She put forward a proposal urging governments that have not yet ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use of Bacteriological Weapons to recognize and ratify this protocol. The proposal also requested national Red Cross societies to work towards this end.

Despite so many facts exposing the actions of the U.S. interventionist army in Korea, the uneasy Nicholson, Vice-Chairman of the American Red Cross, attempted to cover up the matter. In his speech, he stated that he "decided not to answer" all the irrefutable facts and evidence presented by the Chinese, Korean, and Polish delegations. After the U.S. representative spoke, the chairman hurriedly announced the end of the discussion, disregarding the fact that many representatives had requested to speak. At the afternoon meeting, the chairman again prevented discussion of the Chinese delegation's proposal. These facts are very interesting. For days, the controllers of the conference had repeatedly extended their tentacles, probing whether the above-mentioned proposals would be put forward, and if so, when, where, and how they would be put forward, and doing everything possible to prevent these proposals. This has been a notable feature of this conference so far.

Without allowing the representatives to discuss the Chinese delegation's proposal, the chairman held a vote, and the Chinese proposal was unreasonably rejected by a vote of sixty to thirteen. After a brief discussion, the Polish proposal was passed by a vote of forty-nine to eight, with twenty-four abstentions. Those who voted against included the U.S. Red Cross delegation (the U.S. and British governments only sent "observer" delegations), and many Western government delegations, such as France and Italy, abstained.

    中、朝、波代表在国际红十字大会上发言
    谴责美国破坏日内瓦公约的罪行
    我代表要求立即制止一切违反日内瓦公约的暴行
  【新华社多伦多一日电】国际红十字大会总务委员会七月三十日的会议讨论关于批准、普及和施行日内瓦公约的问题。在三十日的会议上，中国政府代表团首席代表苏井观发言，谴责美国干涉者屠杀和虐待战俘、滥炸和屠杀和平居民以至在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的罪行。他指出：这些罪行严重地破坏了日内瓦公约，并违反了红十字会的人道原则。苏井观提出一项提案，号召各国红十字会动员全世界舆论，要求立即停止在朝鲜发生的一切违反日内瓦公约的暴行。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表金民山以愤怒的语调在会上发表了一篇有充分事实根据的演说，揭露美国干涉军在朝鲜所进行的违反日内瓦公约的暴行。撒布带菌毒虫，拷打并屠杀战俘，拒绝遣返战俘，不分皂白地集中轰炸平民——这些行径都证明他们严重地违反了红十字会必须集中力量来捍卫的基本原则。中国和朝鲜代表的谴责，显然使美国代表和它的奴才们极感恐慌。国际红十字大会主席马考莱（加拿大）一再打断中、朝代表的发言，他甚至不让朝鲜代表讲完。红十字会协会理事会主席桑兹特朗（瑞典）也蛮横地提议主席以后禁止这些发言。波兰代表杜迈斯卡在发言中举出了她在朝鲜亲眼看见的关于美军使用细菌武器的更多事实。她提出了一项提案，敦促尚未批准一九二五年关于禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的各国政府承认并批准这个议定书。提案并要求各国红十字会为这个目的而努力。
    尽管有这样多的事实，暴露了美国干涉军在朝鲜的行径，然而，局促不安的美国红十字会副主席尼科逊，却企图把事情掩盖过去。他在发言中声明“决定不回答”中国、朝鲜和波兰代表团所提出的一切无可辩驳的事实和证明。美国代表发言后，主席不顾已经有许多代表要求发言的事实，急急忙忙宣布讨论结束。在下午会议上，主席又阻止对中国代表团提案的讨论。这些事实是很有意思的。大会的控制者几天来接连伸出触角，试探上述提案是否会提出，如果提出的话，将在何时、何地用何种方式提出，并尽一切力量企图阻止这些提案。这是这次大会至今为止的一个显著特点。
    主席没有让代表们对中国代表团的提案进行讨论，就举行表决，中国提案以六十对十三票被无理否决。在经过一个简短的讨论后，波兰提案以四十九票对八票获通过，二十四票弃权。投反对票的有美国红十字会代表团（美、英两国政府仅派遣“观察员”代表团出席），许多西方国家的政府代表团，如法国、意大利等都弃权。
