    Beijing Youth Students Enjoy a Happy Summer Life
    Bai Sheng
    Beijing's young students and children are enjoying a happy summer life. During the summer, they are engaged in various beneficial activities, increasing their knowledge, getting adequate rest, and improving their physical health, preparing them with abundant energy for the new semester.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Youth League and student unions in various schools, summer life committees have been formed to help students enliven their summer lives. Many schools have established summer children's parks, youth parks, youth palaces, children's palaces, cultural palaces, clubs, and other organizations. According to the interests and hobbies of the students, various activity groups have been organized for literary reading, scientific research, specimen collection, aviation models, movies, drama, dance, music, art, news reading, swimming, and other activities. Summer camps, the most beloved by the vast number of young students and children, have been established in the most beautiful scenic spots in the suburbs of Beijing. The first batch of one thousand young university students participating in the coastal summer camp have all arrived at Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe, enjoying a happy coastal holiday. More than two thousand students are camping collectively in the Great Awakening Temple and Tanzhe Temple in the suburbs of Beijing. Many students from Peking University and Tsinghua University have organized many tour groups and visiting groups to visit and travel to Dalian, Guanting Reservoir, Baiyangdian, Heilongtan, and other places. Students from Yenching University have set up rest stops in Yenching Garden to entertain students from the city. Many middle school students are camping collectively in universities with beautiful scenery.
    Students from many schools have organized visits to new-type factories, farms, and schools inside and outside Beijing, as well as comfortable hospitals and sanatoriums. Students from the Municipal No. 5 Girls' Middle School and the Hui Nationality College visited the Fengtai Railway Bridge Factory, and the workers warmly welcomed the students in the rain. Students from the Municipal No. 3 Girls' Middle School and the attached middle school of the Central University for Nationalities visited the Qinghe Woolen Mill and held a get-together with the workers. Many students also visited the Shuangqiao Farm and Wulidian Farm in the suburbs of Beijing, where they saw many cotton plants in full bloom cultivated according to the Soviet close-planting experience. The botany group of the Affiliated Women's Middle School of the Teachers College visited Sun Zhenhai, the creator of the "new propagation method of Populus tomentosa."
    The Beijing Municipal Student Summer Life Guidance Committee has also established an amateur art school to cultivate a large number of activists who love cultural and artistic activities; and has prepared a large number of famous literary works for students of various schools to borrow. Students are widely reading "The Story of Zoya and Shura", "Biography of Liu Hulan", "Lovely China" and "An Ordinary Soldier". These excellent literary works have a profound impact on the students, and the images of heroes educate and encourage the students to move forward. Many school's literary reading groups have held symposiums and discussions, inviting writers to meet with students to discuss reading experiences and reading methods. Students from the Municipal No. 8 Boys' Middle School visited Chen Dengke, the farmer-turned-writer and author of "Living People's Pond". The literary reading groups of the Municipal No. 3 Girls' Middle School and the Municipal No. 8 Boys' Middle School visited Malaqinfu, the young Inner Mongolian writer and author of "People of the Horqin Grassland." This twenty-one-year-old Mongolian writer cordially told the students about his situation when he wrote the novel "People of the Horqin Grassland" in Chinese. From this novel, people not only see the new life of the Mongolian people, but also the author's artistic expression talent.
    Many middle schools and primary schools' Young Pioneer team members enthusiastically participated in aviation model training classes. They are working hard to study and manufacture various models, and are preparing to hold a small exhibition. Everyone decided to make a catapult plane before the end of the summer vacation and organize a competition performance. They gave the airplane models they made themselves to Zhang Jihui, Zhao Baotong, and Liu Yuti, the volunteer air force heroes returning from the Korean front. More than 13,000 young students and children in the capital held get-togethers with the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army on the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day.
    The capital's cinemas have stipulated preferential treatment for young students and children. The Beijing Municipal Student Summer Life Guidance Committee and the Beijing Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have prepared dozens of educational films for the students, such as "Shangrao Concentration Camp", "Steel Warrior", "White-Haired Girl", "Sverdlov", "Tractor Drivers", "Red Scarf", "Danya", etc., which are being shown in various districts one after another. The Beijing Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also invited Soviet expert Comrade Konitieva to give a report to the students on "The Summer Life of Soviet Students." Comrade Konitieva used many specific facts to introduce the happy and happy life of Soviet students during the summer vacation.
    Students who stay in school and at home automatically organize themselves to do radio gymnastics, listen to the radio, and learn Russian. Many students also organize evening parties at sunset and moonlight parties to enrich their activities. The Beijing Municipal Student Summer Life Guidance Committee also holds various lectures to enrich students' knowledge.
    The summer life has not only consolidated and expanded the students' knowledge, but also fully developed the students' collectivist spirit, enhanced their physical health, and cultivated their lively and cheerful character.
