Xinhua News Agency, 2nd August: The construction of the "People's Heroes Monument to those who sacrificed themselves for the country" officially commenced on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army. The monument is located in the southern part of Tiananmen Square in the capital.

On September 30, 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference decided to erect a People's Heroes Monument in the capital, Beijing, to commemorate the people's heroes who sacrificed themselves in the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution. At 6 p.m. that day, all the representatives attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a foundation-laying ceremony for the monument in Tiananmen Square. Chief representatives of various units of the CPPCC, headed by Chairman Mao, took turns shoveling earth to lay the cornerstone of the monument. Over the past two years, outstanding architects and experts from all over the country have designed more than 100 patterns, and after soliciting opinions from people from all walks of life through various channels, the relevant parties have summarized and revised them into the final design.

The monument is divided into three parts: the stele body, the pedestal, and the platform, with a total height of 36.5 meters. The stele body is about 30.5 meters high and 6.5 meters wide. The front will be engraved with the eight characters "人民英雄永垂不朽" ("The People's Heroes are Immortal"), personally written by Chairman Mao, and the back (the back of the stele) will be engraved with the inscription "人民英雄永垂不朽" ("The People's Heroes are Immortal") passed by the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The "waist" part of the pedestal is more than 4 meters high and about 25 meters wide on each side. There is a door in the center of the east and west sides, with stairs leading to the top of the pedestal. The remaining parts are divided into ten sections, each section is 2.5 meters high and 5.5 meters to 10.5 meters wide. Each section is decorated with white marble reliefs showing the heroic history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle over the past century, especially the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War. There will also be an exhibition room with marble walls inside the pedestal. The lowest level of the monument is a square platform about 1 meter high and 50 meters long and wide. The entire monument, except for the relief part, is built of granite and weighs more than 10,000 tons.

The People's Heroes Monument Construction Committee has been formed by representatives from seventeen units, including the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Peng Zhen, Mayor of Beijing, is the chairman of the committee, Zheng Zhenduo and Liang Sicheng are the vice-chairmen, and Xue Zizheng is the secretary-general. The committee has an engineering office, which brings together outstanding architectural experts and art workers from all over the country, and divides them into seven groups, including design, construction, quarrying, and art work, to carry out the work. In addition, a special committee, led by Fan Wenlan, director of the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is responsible for studying the historical materials needed for the relief paintings. At present, the work of drilling the foundation of the monument has been completed, and the construction officially started on the "August 1st" Army Day, and it is planned to lay the foundation before winter. Since the granite carving and the ten large white marble reliefs are very huge and detailed works, the entire project of building the People's Heroes Monument is expected to be completed on the National Day in 1955.

    为国牺牲人民英雄纪念碑“八一”正式兴工
    【新华社二日讯】“为国牺牲人民英雄纪念碑”的建筑工程，在伟大的中国人民解放军建军二十五周年纪念日正式兴工。碑位在首都天安门广场的南部。
    一九四九年九月三十日，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议曾决定，为了纪念在人民解放战争和人民革命中牺牲的人民英雄，在首都北京建立人民英雄纪念碑。当天下午六时，出席中国人民政治协商会议的全体代表，在天安门前广场举行了建立纪念碑的奠基典礼，以毛主席为首的政协各单位首席代表一一执锨铲土，奠下了纪念碑的基石。两年多来，全国优秀的建筑师和专家们先后设计了一百多种图案，经有关方面通过各种方式征求各界人民的意见，现在，已经归纳、修正成最后的图样。
    纪念碑分碑身、台座和月台三部分，共高三十六公尺半。碑身高约三十公尺半，宽六公尺半，正面将刻着毛主席亲笔所写的“人民英雄永垂不朽”八个大字，背面（碑阴）将刻着中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议所通过的“为国牺牲人民英雄纪念碑”碑文。台座“束腰”部分，高四公尺多，每面宽约二十五公尺；东、西两面正中各辟一门，内有阶梯通到台座上面；其余部分分成十格，每格高二公尺半，宽五公尺半至十公尺半不等。每格都以汉白玉石浮雕分别显示一百年来中国人民革命斗争、特别是抗日战争和人民解放战争的英勇史迹。台座内部还有大理石墙面的陈列室。纪念碑的最下层是一个高约一公尺、长宽各五十公尺的正方形大月台。全部纪念碑，除浮雕部分外，都用花岗石筑成，重量在一万吨以上。
    人民英雄纪念碑兴建委员会已由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、中国人民革命军事委员会总政治部、北京市人民政府等十七个单位推派代表组成。由北京市人民政府彭真市长任主任委员，郑振铎、梁思成任副主任委员，薛子正任秘书长。委员会下设工程处，集合全国优秀的建筑专家和美术工作者，分设计、施工、采石、美术工作等七组，进行工作。此外，专设一个委员会，在中国科学院现代史研究所所长范文澜领导下，研究浮雕画面所需的史料题材。现在，钻探纪念碑地基的工作已经完成，“八一”建军节正式开工，计划在冬季以前打好地基。由于花岗石雕砌和十面汉白玉大浮雕的雕塑是非常巨大而细致的工作，兴建人民英雄纪念碑的全部工程，预计将在一九五五年国庆节完成。
