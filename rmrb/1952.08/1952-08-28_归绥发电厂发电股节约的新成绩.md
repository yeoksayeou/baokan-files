    New Achievements in Conservation by the Guisui Power Plant's Generation Division
    Editor: The Guisui Power Plant's Generation Division in Suiyuan Province successfully modified an extractor to improve vacuum, which will save the nation over 200 million yuan in wealth annually.
    In June of this year, the plant leadership decided that the Generation Division should overhaul a certain generator. Trade Union Chairman Zheng Ziwen (a Communist Party member) thought it necessary to increase the vacuum so that another generator could increase its power generation and carry a greater load, otherwise it would affect the power supply. Therefore, he tried to mobilize the experienced workers to study the problem together, and called on everyone to come up with solutions through the workshop blackboard newspaper, first writing down their opinions for everyone to discuss. Experienced workers and workers put forward many suggestions, and Zheng Ziwen, based on these suggestions, led everyone to discuss and experiment. After a month and a half of research, with more than twenty failures in between, Zheng Ziwen finally found the key in the experiment of modifying the extractor. He found a way to increase the water pressure to increase the water flow rate and improve the vacuum. After Zheng Ziwen and the experienced workers successfully experimented, the vacuum increased from 82% to 98%. After the vacuum was improved, coal consumption decreased accordingly, and the machine efficiency also improved, which can save the country more than 200 million yuan in wealth annually.

    归绥发电厂发电股节约的新成绩
    编辑同志：绥远省归绥发电厂发电股，改装抽出器提高真空试验成功，全年可为国家节省二亿多元的财富。
    今年六月这个厂的领导方面，决定要发电股检修某号发电机。工会主席政子文（共产党员）想，必须加大真空，使另一个发电机能够提高发电量多带负荷，不然就会影响供电。于是他就设法发动了老师傅一起研究，并通过车间黑板报号召大家想办法，首先把自己的意见写出来让大家讨论。老师傅和工人们提出了很多意见，政子文根据这些意见，领导大家展开讨论并进行试验。经过一个半月的钻研，其间失败了二十多次，最后，政子文从改装抽出器的试验中找到了窍门，他设法加大了水的压力，使水的流速加大，提高真空。政子文和老师傅们试验成功后，真空由百分之八十二提高到百分之九十八。真空提高后，煤耗随之降低了，机器效率也提高了，全年可为国家节省二亿多元的财富。刘　羽　冠　冠
