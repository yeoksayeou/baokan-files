    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Bucharest: According to the Romanian News Agency, Apostol, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, delivered a speech at the Bucharest rally celebrating the eighth anniversary of Romania's liberation on the 22nd. The following is a summary:
    Eight years ago, thanks to the glorious victory of the Soviet army in defeating the Nazi army, the Romanian people were able, under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, to forever shatter the shackles of the fascist dictatorship and turn their guns against the mortal enemy of the Romanian people—German fascism. The liberation of Romania from the shackles of foreign imperialism and fascist dictatorship marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the Romanian people, signifying the true national and social revival of the Romanian people, and embarking on the path of great revolutionary transformation. The draft of the new Constitution of the Romanian People's Republic enshrines the historic victory won by the Romanian people on August 23, 1944, after centuries of struggle for freedom and national independence, and enshrines the victory won by the working class in its heroic struggle, in alliance with the working peasants, to overthrow forever the capitalist-landlord regime and the shackles of imperialism.
    Thanks to the struggle waged by our working people under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, and thanks to the substantial and multifaceted assistance from the Soviet Union, the economic face of our country has changed dramatically in the eight years since liberation. During the period from the implementation of nationalization to today, our industrial production has almost tripled compared to 1948. The focus of industrialization is the development of heavy industry. Our Party and government have paid special attention to the development of the mining, metallurgy, and petroleum industries. Coal production is now nearly twice that of 1938. The machine-building industry, which Romania never had before, has now become a major sector of our industry. In the year and a half of struggle to realize the Five-Year Plan, many industrial enterprises have been put into operation, expanded, or equipped with modern machinery, many cultural institutions and thousands of workers' houses have been built, and the national electrification plan has achieved its first successes.
    After our Party's Central Committee eliminated the right-leaning deviation, the work of industrialization in our country began to advance at an even faster pace. On our country's great socialist construction sites, projects such as the "Lenin" hydroelectric power station, the Danube-Black Sea Canal, the "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" combined factory, and the "Iskra" printing plant are being accelerated. In the second quarter of this year, the amount of investment in the national economy increased by 40.6 percent compared to the same period last year.
    Our people are also greeting the National Day with brilliant achievements in agriculture. The situation in agriculture has also changed compared to 1948. Because our Party has followed Stalin's doctrine on the socialist transformation of agriculture, and because of the increasing adoption of the outstanding experience of the Bolshevik Party, the socialist sector in agriculture accounts for about 16 percent of the cultivated area. Hundreds of state farms equipped with various agricultural machines have been established, and nearly two hundred machine tractor stations have been set up for use by collective farms and agricultural cooperatives. Despite the fierce opposition of the rich peasants, despite the activities of sabotaging state farms and collective farms, and despite the opportunist policies pursued by those right-leaning deviationists who obstructed the establishment and development of mutual aid teams, more than 1,400 collective farms and more than 900 mutual aid teams have been established. Thanks to these changes in agriculture, the 1951 harvest was able to exceed that of 1950 by 20 percent and, for the first time, exceeded the pre-war 1938 level of agricultural production.
    There are now three socio-economic components in our economy: the socialist component, small commodity production, and private capitalist component. The socialist component is the foundation for the country's development along the socialist road, and it plays a leading role in our economy because it is the most advanced economic component. In this component, the phenomenon of man exploiting man has been eliminated, and it guarantees the complete consistency of the productive forces and production relations, thereby guaranteeing the unprecedented surge in the development of our country's productive forces, and it also guarantees the full expression of the creativity of the working people, because they know that they are working for themselves, not for the exploiters.
    Along with the victories achieved in the economic field, the living standards of the working people have also improved. The most precious right of our working people—the right to work freely for themselves and for society—is fully guaranteed. This right is guaranteed by the existence and development of the socialist structure in the national economy, and by the fact that the factories, mines, and land resources are socialist property and the wealth of all working people.
    Unemployment and crises will never happen again in our country. The working class is growing stronger year by year; it is stipulated that the number of workers will increase by 247,640 in 1953 alone. The result of crushing the right-leaning deviation in our Party's line has improved the supply to the working people and raised their living standards. According to the decision of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers, currency reform and price reductions (the prices of the most essential items have been reduced by an average of 15 percent) have been completed in January of this year. In the second quarter of 1952, urban residents obtained 23 percent more daily necessities through socialist trade than in the first quarter of this year, and rural residents obtained 21.6 percent more daily necessities in the second quarter than in the first quarter. The new draft constitution guarantees the working people the right to rest and recreation. All workers and office staff in our country enjoy annual paid holidays and the right to stay in the most beautiful resorts, which were formerly only for the exploiting classes. The trade unions will send 300,000 workers and staff to the mountains or the seaside for their holidays this year alone.
    Our people's achievements in the cultural field are equally important. The new draft constitution stipulates that the right to education is guaranteed to all working people in the Romanian People's Republic. In 1951, the number of illiterates decreased by 2.5 million compared to 1941. After the education reform, the children of the working people, who had no opportunity to study under the rule of the bourgeois-landlord regime, can enter schools at all levels. The number of secondary school students has increased to four times that of 1938, and the number of university students in 1951 has increased to twice that of 1938. A high tide of training intermediate technical personnel is currently unfolding, and there are now more than 200,000 students receiving this training. Science, art, and literature have never enjoyed such a lofty status as they do under the people's democratic regime. They are developing vigorously, constantly serving the people and the interests of the motherland. The state budget allocates more than 5.3 billion lei for social and cultural measures in 1952 alone.
    Our working people, who are enthusiastically building socialism, are discussing the new draft constitution in every factory and collective farm. Our motherland has only been liberated by the Soviet army for eight years, and it is able to record these great achievements in the country's fundamental law, which our working people are proud of. These achievements prove that our people, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, are advancing along the correct path, along the path leading to socialism and peace, the path of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

    阿波斯托尔在布加勒斯特庆祝罗马尼亚解放八周年大会上的讲话
    【新华社讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社消息：罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席、罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记阿波斯托尔，在二十二日布加勒斯特庆祝罗马尼亚解放八周年大会上发表演说，摘要如下：
    八年以前，由于苏联军队击败了纳粹军队、获得了辉煌的胜利，罗马尼亚人民才有可能在罗马尼亚共产党的领导下，永远粉碎了法西斯独裁政权的枷锁，并把枪口转向罗马尼亚人民的死敌——德国法西斯主义。罗马尼亚从外国帝国主义与法西斯独裁政权的枷锁中获得解放，就意味着罗马尼亚人民历史上新纪元的开始，意味着罗马尼亚人民真正的民族与社会复兴，意味着走上了伟大革命转变的道路。罗马尼亚人民共和国新宪法草案，把几世纪以来就在为自由和民族独立而斗争的罗马尼亚人民在一九四四年八月二十三日获得的历史性胜利固定下来了，把工人阶级在与劳动农民结成联盟共同进行的永远推翻资本家——地主政权和帝国主义枷锁的英勇斗争中获得的胜利固定下来了。
    由于我们劳动人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下进行的斗争，由于苏联大量的、多方面的援助，在解放后八年的今天，我国的经济面貌已经大大改变。从实行国有化到今天这一段期间，我们的工业生产量几乎已达到一九四八年的三倍。工业化的中心是发展重工业。我们党和政府对发展采矿、冶金和石油工业曾给予特别注意。煤的产量已接近一九三八年的两倍。罗马尼亚从前所没有的机器制造工业，现在已成为我国工业的主要部门。在为实现五年计划而进行的一年半的斗争中，许多工业企业已经开工了、扩充了或是以现代化的机器装备起来了，许多文化机关和数千幢工人住宅已经建设起来，国家电气化计划已获得了第一批成绩。
    在我党中央委员会把右倾偏向消灭后，我国工业化的工作开始以更加迅速的速度前进。在我国伟大的社会主义建设工地上，“列宁”水电站、多瑙河—黑海运河、“乔治乌—德治”联合工厂、“火花报”印刷厂等工程正在加速进行。在今年第二季中，国民经济的投资额，比去年同一时期增加了百分之四十点六。
    我国人民并以农业方面的辉煌成就来迎接国庆节。农业方面的情况比起一九四八年也有了改变。由于我们的党遵循了斯大林关于农业的社会主义改造的学说，由于越来越多地采用了布尔什维克党的卓越的经验，农业中的社会主义部分约占耕地面积的百分之十六。数百个备有各种农业机器的国家农场已经成立，还设立了差不多两百个机器拖拉机站，供集体农场和农业合作社使用。尽管富农猛烈反对，尽管有破坏国家农场和集体农场的活动、尽管那些阻挠共耕互助组的成立和发展的右倾偏向分子奉行机会主义政策，仍有一千四百多个集体农场和九百多个共耕互助组成立起来了。由于农业方面的这些改变，一九五一年的收成才有可能超过一九五○年百分之二十，并首次超过战前一九三八年的农业生产水平。
    我们的经济中现在有三种社会经济成分：社会主义成分、小商品生产和私人资本主义成分。社会主义成分是国家沿着社会主义道路发展的基础，它在我国的经济中起着领导作用，因为它是最先进的经济成分。在这种成分中，已消灭了人剥削人的现象，它并保证生产力和生产关系的完全一致，从而保证我们国家的生产力的发展达到空前的高涨，它还保证劳动人民的创造力得以充分发挥，因为他们知道他们是为自己工作，而不是为剥削者工作的。
    与经济方面获得胜利的同时，劳动人民的生活水平也提高了。我国劳动人民的最宝贵的权利——为他们自己和为社会而自由工作的权利——得到了充分的保障。由于国民经济中社会主义结构的存在和发展，由于工厂、矿山、土地的富源都是社会主义财产、是全体劳动人民的财富，这种权利是有保障的。
    失业和危机再也不会在我国发生了。工人阶级正在一年年地壮大；规定单是一九五三年工人就要增加二十四万七千六百四十人。把我们党的路线中的右倾偏向粉碎的结果，改善了对劳动人民的供应，提高了他们的生活水准。根据罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会和部长会议的决定，改革币制和减低物价（最必需的物品的价格平均减低百分之十五）已经在今年一月间完成了。一九五二年的第二季度内，城市居民通过社会主义的贸易所获得的日用品比今年第一季度多了百分之二十三，乡村居民在第二季度所得的日用品比第一季度多了百分之二十一点六。新的宪法草案保证劳动人民有休养和休息的权利。我国的一切工人和机关工作人员每年都享有工资照付的假日和住在最美丽的休养地的权利，这些休养地在从前是仅仅属于剥削阶级的。各工会在今年一年内将送三十万工人和职员到山上或海边去度他们的假日。
    我国人民在文化方面的成就也是同样重要的。新宪法草案规定：保证罗马尼亚人民共和国内一切劳动人民的学习权利。在一九五一年中，文盲的数字比一九四一年减少了二百五十万人。在教育改革之后，劳动人民的儿女们都可以进入各级学校读书，这些劳动人民的儿女在资产阶级——地主政权统治之下是没有机会学习的。中等学校学生的数目增加到一九三八年的四倍，一九五一年的大学生的数目增加到一九三八年的两倍。目前正展开一个训练中等技术人材的高潮，现在受这种训练的学生有二十多万人。科学、艺术和文学从来没有享受过像在人民民主政权下所享受的这样崇高的地位。它们都在有力地发展着，不断地为人民和祖国的利益服务。国家预算中仅仅拨充一九五二年社会文化措施经费就有五十三亿多列伊。
    热情建设社会主义的我国劳动人民，正在每一个工厂、集体农场中讨论着新宪法草案。我们祖国仅仅被苏联军队解放八年，就能够在国家的根本法中记载下这些伟大的成就，我国的劳动人民都以此感到自豪。这些成就证明：我们人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，正沿着正确的道路前进，沿着导向社会主义与和平的道路，马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的道路前进。
