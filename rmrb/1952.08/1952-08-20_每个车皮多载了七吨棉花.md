    Each railcar loaded seven tons more cotton
    Comrade Editor: The Shanxian Station of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration and the Shanxian Office of the China Cotton Yarn & Fabric Company closely cooperated to improve cotton packaging technology, increasing the loading capacity from sixteen tons to twenty-three tons per car.
    In May of this year, the cotton loading capacity of each "ㄨ—" type standard car at Shanxian Station was 140 bales, weighing sixteen tons. After launching the full-load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer campaign, the station's employees took the initiative to contact the Shanxian Office of the China Cotton Yarn & Fabric Company to study ways to compact cotton packaging and improve loading methods. The station's freight director also personally went to the packaging site to study with the workers. After more than two months of efforts, the packaging machine has increased the average weight per bale from 220 jin to 265 jin, with a maximum of 280 jin; the loading capacity per car has increased from 140 bales to 174 bales, and the weight has increased from sixteen tons to twenty-three tons.
    Shanxian ships out more than 10 million jin of cotton annually. Due to the increased loading capacity, 95 railcars can be saved each year. If Shanxian's advanced packaging experience is promoted nationwide, its economic value will be significant. Han Jiaojin

    每个车皮多载了七吨棉花
    编辑同志：郑州铁路管理局陕县车站和中国花纱布公司陕县办事处密切配合，改进了棉花包装技术，装车量由每车十六吨提高到二十三吨。
    陕县车站今年五月间，每个“ㄨ—”型标准车棉花装载量是一百四十包，重十六吨。在展开满载、超轴、五百公里运动后，这个站的职工主动地和中国花纱布公司陕县办事处联系，研究紧缩棉花包装，改进装车方法；车站货运主任也亲自到打包现场和工人一起研究。经过两个多月的努力，打包机已做到了由平均每包二百二十斤，提高到二百六十五斤，最高达到二百八十斤；装载量每车由一百四十包提高到一百七十四包，重量由十六吨提高到二十三吨。
    陕县每年外运棉花达一千万斤以上，由于装载量的提高，每年可节省九十五辆车皮。陕县的先进打包经验，若推广全国，其经济价值是很大的。韩角今
