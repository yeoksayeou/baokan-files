    Hebei Province's Various Special Districts and Municipal Agencies Universally Inspect Cadres' Newspaper Reading and Learning

    To the Editor: The Propaganda Departments of the various Provincial, Municipal Party Committees in our province have universally inspected the newspaper reading situation of staff members in agencies at the same level, and have held current affairs quizzes. During the inspections, various localities found that, although great efforts were made last year to "oppose neglecting political orientation," and after the great "Three-Anti" movement, many leaders in agencies and some cadres have not thoroughly corrected the erroneous view of "only caring about professional work and not caring about politics." Therefore, the situation of cadres in various agencies neglecting reading newspapers and learning is still very serious. Most of the economic and business units and health departments have the worst newspaper reading and learning habits. Among the 103 cadres in the Tianjin Special District Bank and Native Produce Company, only 10 percent read the newspaper regularly. Among the 90 cadres in the Xingtai Special District Hospital, only 10 seriously read the newspaper. In the Tangshan City Kailuan Directly Subordinate Party Committee and other five departments, 1,170 people participated in the test, and 51 percent failed. In the Qinhuangdao City Bank and other four economic departments, 101 people participated in the test, and 90 percent failed. Some cadres did not know what the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements were, some cadres knew nothing about the Korean armistice negotiations, some cooperative cadres did not know what the nature of the cooperatives was, some economic and business departments' cadres did not know the significance of launching the patriotic production increase and economy practice movement, and some rural cadres did not know the direction of rural economic development. How can these people effectively implement the Party's various policies?

    The main reasons for the above phenomenon are that the leading cadres of these agencies do not have a sufficient understanding of the important significance of studying newspapers. They still have the purely technical viewpoint of "not caring about politics." Many leading cadres themselves are trapped in the mire of事務ism, and they cannot study well themselves, let alone guide and help others to study. Only one of the manager and four section chiefs of the Cangxian Special District Grain Company studied better, reading the newspaper 15 times a month. Of course, newspaper reading and learning in these agencies will fall into a leaderless, unregulated state. In order to overcome this very serious phenomenon, we must first correct the various erroneous understandings of leading cadres regarding newspaper reading and learning. Recently, we have issued a circular stipulating the following methods to strengthen current affairs learning:

    1. The propaganda departments of party committees at all levels should conduct a mass inspection of the newspaper reading situation of agency cadres, and leading cadres should make mobilization reports, explaining the important significance of reading newspapers, criticizing various erroneous ideas that neglect reading newspapers, and calling on cadres to consciously conduct inspections. After the inspection, establish a regular newspaper reading system.

    2. Leading comrades of all departments should set an example, do a good job in reading newspapers and learning, and promptly pay attention to and guide the learning of cadres in their own agencies. Leading cadres who do not pay attention to reading newspapers and learning should be criticized by the party committee at the same level or the party organization of their own agency.

    3. The party branches of agencies should regularly understand the newspaper reading and learning situation of their units, promptly carry out commendations and criticisms, and regularly hold current affairs reports, quizzes, etc., to strengthen the guidance and supervision of newspaper reading and learning. For comrades with low cultural level and no self-study ability, the branch should find ways to help them study.

### 河北省各专区、市级机关普遍检查干部读报学习情况

    河北省各专区、市级机关普遍检查干部读报学习情况
    编辑同志：我省各地委、市委宣传部普遍地检查了同级机关工作人员的读报情况，并且举行了时事测验。各地在检查中发现，虽然在去年曾经用很大的力量“反对不问政治倾向”，又经过了伟大的“三反”运动，但不少机关的领导方面及若干干部，并没有彻底纠正了“只管业务，不问政治”的错误观点；因此，各机关干部忽视读报学习的情况还是很严重的。多数经济企业单位和卫生部门干部的读报学习是最差的。天津专区银行和土产公司两个单位的一百零三名干部中，经常看报的仅有百分之十，邢台专区医院九十名干部中，认真读报的仅有十人。唐山市开滦直属党委等五个部门有一千一百七十人参加了测验，不及格的达百分之五十一。秦皇岛市银行等四个经济部门有一百零一人参加测验，不及格的占百分之九十。有的干部不知道什么是“三反”“五反”运动，有的干部对朝鲜停战谈判一无所知，有些合作社的干部不知道合作社是什么性质，有些经济企业部门的干部不知道开展爱国增产节约运动的意义，有些农村干部不知道农村经济发展方向，这些人怎么能够有效地贯彻党的各项政策呢？
    发生上述现象的原因，主要是这些机关的领导干部对学习报纸的重要意义认识不足，他们还存在着
    “不问政治”的单纯技术观点。不少领导干部自身陷于事务主义的泥坑中，自己还不能好好地学习，更不用说指导和帮助别人学习了。沧县专区粮食公司经理和四个科长，只有一个人学习较好，一个月看了十五次报。当然，这些机关中的读报学习要陷于无人领导，没有制度的自流状态了。为了克服这种非常严重的现象，首先必须纠正领导干部中对于读报学习的各种错误认识。最近我们已发出通报，规定了以下几种加强时事学习的办法：
    一、各级党委宣传部应将机关干部的读报情况做一次群众性的检查，并由领导干部做动员报告，说明读报的重要意义，批判忽视读报的各种错误思想，号召干部自觉地进行检查。检查之后建立经常的读报制度。
    二、各部门领导同志要以身作则，搞好读报学习，并及时注意和领导本机关干部的学习。不重视读报学习的领导干部，应受到同级党委或本机关党组织的批评。
    三、机关党的支部要经常了解本单位读报学习情况，及时进行表扬和批评，定期举行时事报告、测验等，以加强对读报学习的指导和督促作用。对文化程度过低、无自学能力的同志，支部要想法帮助他们学习。  中共河北省委宣传部
