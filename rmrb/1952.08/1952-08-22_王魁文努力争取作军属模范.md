    Wang Kuiwen Strives to Be a Model Military Family Member
    Editor: Please forward this to Minister Xie Juezai of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government. I was very happy to read Minister Xie's letter of慰问(wèiwèn - congratulations and solicitude) to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, revolutionary disabled veterans, the sick and wounded, and the families of martyrs and military personnel on the 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day (see the July 29th People's Daily).
    I am a family member of a soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. My eldest child, Wang Fulin, joined the revolutionary ranks in 1946, and a year ago, he joined the Volunteer Army. During this time, the Communist Party and the People's Government have shown meticulous care and concern for my family, sending us慰问(wèiwèn - congratulations and solicitude)gifts and letters during festivals and providing us with monthly living subsidies. From June of last year, I suffered from a period of lung disease, and the Sujiatun District People's Government introduced me to treatment and also issued me monthly recuperation subsidies. Now my illness is completely cured. I will write a letter to my eldest child to tell him about these things, so that he will eliminate more American devils in Korea. I will definitely follow Minister Xie's words in the rear, work hard in production, and step up my work. The five mu of dry land that the People's Government lent me, I have already worked it very well. Now the corn has matured, and the beans and sorghum are growing very thick. During the autumn harvest, I will pay the public grain to the People's Government in advance. In addition, I will take the lead in doing a good job in sanitation. On the production front and in various patriotic movements, I will strive to be a model military family member.

    王魁文努力争取作军属模范
    编辑同志：请替我转告中央人民政府内务部谢觉哉部长。我读了谢部长在“八一”建军节二十五周年纪念时给中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军、革命残废军人、伤病员及烈属、军属的慰问信（见七月二十九日人民日报），感到很高兴。
    我是中国人民志愿军军人的家属。我的大孩子王福林是一九四六年参加革命队伍的，一年前又参加了志愿军。这当中，共产党、人民政府对我家的关怀和照顾真是无微不至，逢年过节都给我家送慰问品和慰问信，每月还送生活补助费给我。从去年六月开始，我闹了一个时期的肺病，苏家屯区人民政府便介绍我去治疗，每月还发给我疗养补助费。现在我的病完全好了。我将把这些情况写信告诉我的大孩子，要他在朝鲜多消灭美国鬼子。我在后方一定按照谢部长的话，努力生产，加紧工作。人民政府贷给我的五亩旱田，我已经把它弄得很好。现在苞米已经成熟，豆子、高粱都长得很粗大。秋收时，我要提前向人民政府缴纳公粮。另外，我还要带头做好卫生工作。在生产战线上和各种爱国运动中，我都要争取作军属模范。
