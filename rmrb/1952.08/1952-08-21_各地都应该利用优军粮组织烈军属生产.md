    All Regions Should Use Preferential Grain to Organize Production for Families of Martyrs and Soldiers
    Editor: An old army dependent in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, said to me: "The People's Government sends us preferential grain every month, and it's just eaten up. I think it would be better to concentrate the preferential grain for production. If production is improved, our living difficulties will be solved, and the government will no longer need to provide preferential grain. This is good for the country." What this old man said is very correct. Originally, preferential grain was issued by the People's Government to relieve the lives of poor families of martyrs and soldiers in various places; the Central People's Government also instructed local People's Governments to use this preferential grain to organize families of martyrs and soldiers to carry out production, in order to gradually reduce the scope of relief. Therefore, I believe that not only should the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government pay attention to this issue, but all regions that have not used preferential grain to organize the production of families of martyrs and soldiers should do so as soon as possible.

### 各地都应该利用优军粮组织烈军属生产

    各地都应该利用优军粮组织烈军属生产
    编辑同志：河北省石家庄市的一位军属老大爷对我说：“人民政府月月发给俺优军粮，吃了就完了。我看不如把优军粮集中在一块搞生产好。生产搞好了，俺的生活困难解决了，政府就不用再给优军粮了，这对国家有好处。”这位老大爷的话很对。本来，优军粮是人民政府为了救济各地贫苦烈军属的生活而发的；中央人民政府也曾经指示各地人民政府要利用这种优军粮组织烈军属进行生产，以逐渐缩小救济范围。所以我认为，不仅石家庄市人民政府应该注意这一问题，凡是没有利用优军粮组织烈、军属进行生产的地区，都应该尽快做起来。
