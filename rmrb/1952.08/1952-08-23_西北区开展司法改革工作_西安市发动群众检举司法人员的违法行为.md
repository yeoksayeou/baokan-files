    Northwest Region Launches Judicial Reform Work
    Xi'an Mobilizes the Masses to Report Illegal Acts by Judicial Personnel
    [This Newspaper reports] The entire Northwest Region has now launched judicial reform work. The Judicial Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Northwest Branch of the Supreme People's Court convened a judicial symposium on July 2nd, attended by heads of courts from various provinces and cities in the Northwest Region. The meeting focused on reporting the impure organization and impure ideology existing in people's courts at all levels in the Northwest, and discussed the issues of eliminating reactionary old legal views and old yamen styles, thoroughly reforming and rectifying people's courts at all levels in the Northwest. The Political and Legal Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the Judicial Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and six other units formed the Northwest Judicial Reform Committee; and dispatched four inspection teams to southern Shaanxi and other places to assist in carrying out the judicial reform movement.
    As of August 11th, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xi'an had established judicial reform committees and assigned dedicated personnel to organize offices. Xing Zhaotang, Chairman of Ningxia Province, Zhao Shoushan, Chairman of Qinghai Province, and Fang Zhongru, Mayor of Xi'an, personally served as directors of the respective provincial and municipal judicial reform committees. Shaanxi and Xinjiang are also preparing to establish judicial reform committees. Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Qinghai convened joint meetings of county and city people's court presidents or vice presidents to convey, discuss, and arrange judicial reform work. Gansu Province also sent cadres to various special districts to convey the message. Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan and other cities have begun conducting publicity among the masses.
    [Another Report] Since August 1st, Xi'an has been conducting thorough ideological and work inspections among all judicial personnel in the city; at the same time, it has mobilized the masses to report illegal and derelict acts by judicial personnel.
    On August 1st, all judicial personnel in the city gathered to study documents. Ren Fuzhong, Deputy Director of the Xi'an Judicial Reform Committee, made a mobilization report, encouraging everyone to break through ideological concerns, launch self-criticism and mutual criticism, and criticize old legal views and old yamen styles from all aspects. On the afternoon of the 4th, Deputy Director Ren Fuzhong also gave a report on this movement to more than 2,000 propagandists in the city. After the meeting, various districts successively convened various meetings to mobilize the masses to participate in this movement. In order to cooperate with this movement, the Municipal People's Procuratorate set up eight complaint boxes throughout the city, and wrote an open letter to people from all walks of life in the city, requesting people from all walks of life to report illegal acts by judicial personnel, and to put forward requirements and opinions on the people's courts. After the mobilization, the masses were in high spirits, and as of the 12th, the masses had put forward more than 600 criticisms and suggestions.
    From the self-criticisms of judicial personnel and the letters from the masses, several main problems in Xi'an's judicial personnel and people's judicial work have been initially identified:
    (1) Feudal ideas that value men over women. For example, Wu Zifeng committed suicide due to mental abuse by her husband, but the court did not convict her husband. (2) No action is taken without accusation, no attention is paid even when accused, and cases are delayed after accusation. For example, a trial judge handling the family division case between Ma Tengqi and Ma Ruixiang, because he felt that the family division case was difficult to handle, simply put the case aside, calling it "suspension." (3) Simple civil or criminal viewpoint. For example, a unit of the People's Liberation Army was defrauded of 150 million yuan by an illegal businessman, Wang Qingan, to do business. The Criminal Court considered it a civil matter and pushed it to the Civil Court. The Civil Court ordered Wang Qingan to be released on bail, and Wang Qingan fled after being bailed out. He was later captured by the public security organs and sent back to the Criminal Court for handling. (4) Sitting in court and questioning, neglecting investigation and research. Using the excuse of too many cases, they delay in-depth contact with the masses, are unwilling to go out of the court to conduct investigation and research, resulting in subjective and one-sided judgments. Some trial judges even believe that "What do the common people know! What can be investigated from them!" (5) Emphasizing confessions and neglecting evidence, resulting in framing good people and infringing on human rights. For example, when the Xi'an People's Court handled the embezzlement case of Shen Baosheng of the Xi'an Branch of the Longhai Railway, it simply based its judgment of two years imprisonment on the materials of the Xi'an Branch and Shen Baosheng's confession, without investigating the whereabouts of the funds. During the "Three-Anti" movement, it was confirmed that the embezzler was Wang Mianzhi, making Shen Baosheng unjustly suffer two years of imprisonment. (6) Judicial formalism. Judgments adopt old-fashioned formats, such as clichés like "both parties," "litigation," and "based on the above conclusion," regardless of whether the masses understand them. Regardless of whether the prisoner admits it or not, or whether it has been investigated clearly, it is uniformly written "confesses without objection" and "recorded on file."
    In order to further carry out this movement, the Xi'an Judicial Reform Committee held an enlarged meeting on the afternoon of August 12th, and discussed and arranged the work for the next stage. The meeting decided that each district must assign special personnel to be responsible for this work, and attention must be paid to combining publicity with mobilizing reporting. Starting from August 13th, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and other groups will separately convene forums for people from different social strata (mainly parties involved) to break down the concerns of the masses and mobilize them to boldly offer opinions. Judicial personnel will shift from studying documents to discussing specific cases, conducting analysis and criticism, so as to deepen the movement a step further.

    西北区开展司法改革工作
    西安市发动群众检举司法人员的违法行为
    【本报讯】西北全区现已展开司法改革工作。西北军政委员会司法部和最高人民法院西北分院，曾于七月二日召集西北区各省、市法院负责人举行司法座谈会。会上着重汇报了西北各级人民法院所存在的组织不纯与思想不纯的情况，讨论了肃清反动的旧法观点和旧衙门作风、彻底改造和整顿西北各级人民法院的问题。西北军政委员会政治法律委员会、西北军政委员会司法部等七个单位，组成了西北司法改革委员会；并派了四个检查组，分赴陕南等地协助开展司法改革运动。
    截至八月十一日，甘肃、宁夏、青海、西安市都已成立了司法改革委员会，并抽出专人组织办公室。宁夏省主席邢肇棠、青海省主席赵寿山、西安市市长方仲如，亲自兼任各该省、市司法改革委员会主任。陕西、新疆司法改革委员会也正在准备成立。陕西、宁夏、青海分别召开了县、市人民法院院长或副院长联席会，传达、讨论和布置了司法改革工作。甘肃省并派干部分赴各专区进行传达。西安、兰州、西宁、银川等市已开始向群众进行宣传。
    【又讯】西安市自八月一日起，在全市司法人员中普遍进行深入的思想检查和工作检查；同时发动群众检举司法人员的违法渎职行为。
    八月一日，全市司法人员即集中进行文件学习。西安市司法改革委员会副主任任扶中作了动员报告，启发大家打破思想顾虑，展开检讨和互相批评，从各方面批判旧法观点和旧衙门作风。四日下午，任扶中副主任并向全市两千多名宣传员作了有关这一运动的报告。会后，各区即先后召开各种会议，发动群众参加这一运动。市人民检察署为了配合这一运动，在全市设立了八处控告箱，并给全市各界人民写了一封公开信，要求各界人民检举司法人员的违法行为，提出对人民法院的要求和意见。经过发动以后，群众情绪很高，截至十二日止，群众共提出批评意见和建议六百多件。
    从司法人员的检讨和群众信件中，初步看出了西安市司法人员及人民司法工作中几个主要问题：
    （一）重男轻女的封建思想。如乌子凤因受丈夫精神虐待自杀，但法院未对其丈夫判罪。（二）不告不理、告也不理、告下就拖。如某审判人员处理马腾祺与马瑞祥分家案，因觉得分家案难办，竟自动把案件放下，名为“休止”。（三）单纯民事或刑事观点。如人民解放军某部被不法商人王清安骗取一亿五千万元做生意，刑庭认为是民事，推到民庭，民庭令王清安取保交款，保出后王清安即逃跑了，后经公安机关捕回，又送刑庭处理。（四）坐堂问案，忽视调查研究。藉口案件多，深入群众耽搁时间，不愿走出法庭进行调查研究，以致产生主观片面的判决。有的审判员还认为“老百姓懂得甚么！向他们能调查出什么东西来！”（五）重视口供、忽略证据，以致冤了好人，侵犯人权。如西安市人民法院处理陇海铁路西安分局沈葆生贪污案时，单纯根据西安分局的材料和沈葆生的口供，不追查款项着落，判决徒刑二年。“三反”运动中证实贪污犯系王勉之，使沈葆生冤枉受刑二年。（六）司法八股。判决书采用老一套的格式，如“两造”、“讼争”、“基上论结”等陈词滥调，不管人民群众是否懂得。不论犯人是否承认，是否调查清楚，千篇一律写“供认不讳”、“纪录在卷”。
    为了更进一步开展这一运动，八月十二日下午，西安市司法改革委员会举行扩大会议，并对下一阶段工作作了讨论和布置。会议决定：各区必须设专人负责这一工作，并须注意宣传与动员检举相结合。从八月十三日开始，市总工会等团体分别召集各不同阶层群众（主要是当事人）的座谈会，打破群众顾虑，动员大胆提意见。司法人员则从学文件转入对具体案件的讨论，进行分析批判，使运动更加深入一步。
