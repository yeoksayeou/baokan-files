    Japanese Teachers and Staff Union Holds Public Opinion Poll
    Most Japanese People Support Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch] The Japanese Teachers and Staff Union recently conducted a public opinion poll on peace and war throughout the country. According to the results tallied from seven prefectures—Aomori, Fukushima, Gunma, Wakayama, Kagawa, Tokushima, and Ehime—the vast majority of Japanese people support peace and oppose the war preparations policies of the reactionary factions of the United States and Japan.
    The union raised a number of questions about peace and war, asking those participating in the poll to answer them. The majority of those participating in the poll indicated that they were opposed to the revival of Japanese militarism. For example, when asked "Are you willing to join the Police Reserve Force?" 79 percent of the people answered that they were unwilling, with only 8 percent saying they were willing to join. Another 8 percent indicated that they would only participate if it was unavoidable, and 6 percent did not express an opinion.
    In response to the question "Do you support a conscription system?" 72.4 percent expressed opposition, only 6.4 percent expressed support, 17 percent indicated that a conscription system could only be implemented if it was unavoidable, and 3.6 percent did not express an opinion.

    大多数日本人民都拥护和平
    【新华社讯】东京消息：日本教职员工会最近在全国各地举行了一次有关和平与战争的民意测验。根据青森、福岛、群马、和歌山、香川、德岛和爱媛这七个县统计的结果，表明绝大多数的日本人民都拥护和平，反对美、日反动派的备战政策。
    该工会提出一些有关和平与战争的问题，要求参加测验的人回答。大多数参加测验的人都表示他们是反对复活日本军国主义的。例如在问到“你是否愿意参加警察后备队”时，百分之七十九的人回答说不愿意，只有百分之八的人表示愿意参加。另外有百分之八的人表示在不得已的情形下才肯参加，还有百分之六的人没有表示意见。
    在回答“你是否赞成征兵制度”这一问题时，表示反对的人有百分之七十二点四，只有百分之六点四的人表示赞成，百分之十七的人表示在不得已的情形下才能实行征兵制度，有百分之三点六的人没有表示意见。
