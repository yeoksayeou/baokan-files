    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 13th: As the Korean armistice talks dwindle due to Harrison's repeated insistence on prolonged recesses, incidents of the U.S. side violating the neutralization agreement and undermining the safety of the conference area are increasing. On the afternoon of August 11th, three more U.S. aircraft intruded into the Panmunjom conference area. This marks the fourth provocative incident caused by the U.S. side since August. What is particularly serious is that the U.S. side has once again adopted its old tactic of flat denial, refusing investigation, and treating the agreements between the two sides as waste paper.
    Our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, lodged a protest with the U.S. side on the 12th regarding the most recent incident. Colonel Zhang pointed out: The recent series of incidents shows that the U.S. side is deliberately undermining the armistice negotiations and has no intention of abiding by the agreements between the two sides. However, the agreements reached between the two sides must not be arbitrarily torn up by the U.S. side, and the U.S. side must bear all the consequences arising therefrom.
    Sources close to the Korean-Chinese delegation here believe that the recent series of provocative incidents by the U.S. side closely corresponds to Harrison's unreasonable attitude inside the conference tent. On the afternoon of August 2nd, U.S. troops continuously shelled the conference area and its periphery for as long as three hours. The next morning, Harrison arrived at Panmunjom, said he had "nothing to say," and insisted on a week-long recess. On the third day (August 4th), U.S. aircraft flew over the conference area three times. On the afternoon of August 10th, U.S. aircraft again intruded into the conference area. On the 11th, Harrison returned to Panmunjom, said he had "nothing to say," and insisted on another week-long recess. That afternoon, U.S. aircraft blatantly intruded into the conference area again. Just hours before this incident occurred, our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, had lodged a protest with the U.S. side regarding the August 10th incident of U.S. aircraft flying over Panmunjom, demanding that the U.S. side restrain its military personnel to ensure compliance with the agreement.
    Sources here point out that Article 2 of the understanding reached by the liaison officers of both sides in October of last year regarding the resumption of the delegation meeting clearly stipulates: "Investigations into reported violations of the agreement will be conducted in accordance with the past practices of the liaison officers." And the established practice in the past was that neither party could refuse the other's request for an investigation. The U.S. side is openly violating the agreement and practices, refusing to conduct an investigation. This paradoxical attitude is clearly a deliberate attempt to provoke trouble.
    The U.S. side's approach reminds sources here clearly of the situation last August. At that time, the U.S. side created provocative incidents such as assassinating our military police and bombing the residence of our delegation, and refused to deal with them seriously and responsibly, and refused our request for a review. This August, the U.S. side is repeating the old tricks. In order to detain tens of thousands of our captured personnel, they refuse to meet, clamoring for a reckless bombing of 78 Korean peaceful cities; at the same time, they are constantly disrupting the conference area, sending aircraft to fly over the Kaesong neutral zone day and night, and stubbornly denying the incidents that have occurred. However, just as the U.S. side's various conspiracies ultimately failed last year, the U.S. side's new conspiracy this year will only meet with a more disgraceful failure.

### 开城人士揭露美方制造挑衅的新阴谋

    开城人士揭露美方制造挑衅的新阴谋
    【新华社开城十三日电】当朝鲜停战谈判会议因哈利逊一再坚持长期休会而愈开愈少的时候，美方违反中立化协议，破坏会场区安全的事件却愈来愈多。十一日下午，又有美机三架侵犯板门店会场区。这是八月以来美方制造的第四次挑衅事件。尤其严重的，是美方对这些事件又采取了矢口否认，拒绝调查，视双方协议如废纸的老办法。
    我方首席联络官张春山上校于十二日就最近一次事件对美方提出抗议。张上校指出：最近一连串的事件显示美方蓄意破坏停战谈判，已无意遵守双方协议。但是，双方达成的协议绝不容许美方任意撕毁，美方必须负起由此而产生的一切后果。
    接近朝中代表团的此间人士认为：美方最近制造的一系列挑衅事件是与哈利逊在会议帐篷内的无理态度密切应合的。八月二日下午，美方部队连续向会场区及其边缘炮击达三小时之久。第二天早晨，哈利逊来到板门店，“无话可说”，坚持休会一周。第三天（四日），美机三次飞越会场区。八月十日下午，美机又侵犯会场区。十一日哈利逊回到板门店，“无话可说”，坚持再休会一周。当天下午美机又公然侵犯会场区。仅仅在这一次事件发生前数小时，我方首席联络官张春山上校曾就八月十日美机飞越板门店事件对美方提出抗议，要求美方约束其军事人员，以确保对协议的遵守。
    此间人士指出：去年十月双方联络官对代表团复会事宜协议所达成的谅解第二条明确规定：“对于报称违反协议事件的调查，将按过去联络官的惯例进行。”而过去已经建立的惯例是任何一方要求调查，对方不得拒绝。美方公然违背协议及惯例，拒绝进行调查。这种悖谬态度，明明是蓄意寻衅。
    美方的这种做法使此间人士清楚记起去年八月的情况。当时，美方制造了暗杀我方军事警察、轰炸我方代表团驻地等挑衅事件，并拒绝作认真负责的处理，拒绝我方进行复查的要求。今年八月，美方又在重演旧剧。为要扣留成万名我方被俘人员，他们拒绝开会，叫嚣将对七十八个朝鲜和平城市狂轰滥炸；同时不断破坏会场区，派遣飞机日夜在开城中立区上空飞越，并对已发生的事件蛮横抵赖。但是，正如去年美方的种种阴谋终未得逞，今年美方的新阴谋也只会遭到更可耻的失败。
