Three Books Analyzing Imperialist Economic Aggression Against China
    Qian Jiaju
   "Imperialist Investment in China" "American Imperialist Economic Aggression in China" "British Enterprises in China and Their Profits" Written by Wei Zichu, Published by People's Publishing House.
    These three books are all pamphlets, totaling just over one hundred and thirty pages. However, they have mastered considerable and extensive data, and systematically and comprehensively analyzed imperialist economic aggression against China.
    For more than a hundred years, imperialists have continuously invested their bloody capital in China, sucking the blood and sweat of the Chinese people like blood vessels, creating countless cruel incidents; but in our historical data, we have never seen systematic analysis and records. From some dubious, fragmented records, the author of these three books made a relatively comprehensive estimate of imperialist investment in China and its exploitation of the Chinese people.
    These three books are full of numbers. However, the author does not simply list numbers, nor does he simply analyze numbers, but uses the theory of imperialist aggression against colonies and capital export as a basis to comprehensively analyze and summarize these statistical materials. In the book "Imperialist Investment in China," the author pointed out the imbalance in the development of investment in China by various imperialist countries. Based on major historical events such as the Boxer Rebellion, World War I, the "September 18th" Incident, and the "July 7th" Incident, he divided the stages, analyzed the changes in the quantity and proportion of investment in China by various imperialist countries in each stage, and explained the battle for the Chinese market by imperialist capital; among them, the development of American imperialist capital was particularly evident. In the second chapter of the book, "Characteristics of Investment," the author pointed out that direct investment—the direct and primitive form of imperialists exploiting the surplus labor of colonies—accounted for a particularly large proportion of these investments; at the same time, he pointed out the super-economic plunder nature of investment—real estate, political loans, "religious," "cultural," and "charitable" investments; this is closely related to imperialist privileges in China and China's economic backwardness. In analyzing the content of investment, the author proved that more than half of foreign investment was used for commercial and predatory undertakings, while only a little over ten percent was used for producers; at the same time, he pointed out the geographical concentration of investment, which is inseparable from the colonial dependence of China's industry. Most noteworthy is that the author proved from the analysis of the source of foreign investment and the extraction of profits that most of the funds of foreigners in China did not come from foreign countries, but were plundered from China; not only that, but the profits they took back from China far exceeded the funds they invested. In addition, the author also made some estimates and explanations of the high profit rate of foreign investment, its proportion in various economic sectors, and the changes after liberation.
    The statistical data used by the author are not without flaws, especially due to the lack of systematic records, it is necessary to select the investigations and estimates of imperialist institutions and their "scholars." Generally speaking, although these materials have been carefully sorted and re-estimated by the author, their certainty is still limited. But despite this, these materials are extremely powerful in explaining the above analysis. The use of statistics must be based on the theory of political economy and historical materialism, not simply looking for patterns from numbers. "Only by scientifically understanding the essence of social phenomena and the tasks facing the working class can statistics scientifically reflect real social relations" ("Struggle for Marxist-Leninist Statistical Theory," Soviet "Statistical Weekly," 1950, Issue 2, translated by Zha Rui). From a methodological point of view, this book provides an example of using statistical data—especially in the case where statistical data on China's economy generally have inherent defects—to study economic and historical issues. This is worth noting. Because up to now, there are still many statistical methods and tendencies in China's economic research work that pursue bourgeois formal mathematics and are divorced from the basis of political economy and historical materialism. Marx's instructions on the issue of wage rates are of particular importance to us: "Only after understanding the various relations on which the rate of profit is formed can statistics be applied to the realistic analysis of wage rates in various eras and countries" (Capital, Chinese edition, Volume III, Part 1, page 180). The author of this book basically correctly used the method of Marxist-Leninist statistics.
    The books "American Imperialist Economic Aggression in China" (actually a study of American imperialist investment in China) and "British Enterprises in China and Their Profits" are actually sub-volumes of the first book, that is, a more detailed and in-depth analysis of the investment of the United States and the United Kingdom. The methods used are still consistent with the first book. In these two books, the author made special chapters on the history, characteristics, and profits of capital exports from the United States and the United Kingdom, drawing materials up to after World War II. These analyses confirmed Lenin's foresight in the theory of imperialist capital export, and at the same time pointed out that although the United States is a rising imperialist country, it is the capital exporting country that "matured" (referring to overseas income exceeding capital export) the fastest and extracted the most profits.
    Regarding American investment, the author describes it from three aspects: enterprise investment, loan investment, and "religious" and "cultural" investment. Regarding British investment, only enterprise investment is described, but it is more detailed, and its capital system is analyzed. Concise text, clear viewpoints, and organized structure are all consistent advantages in the three books.
    Naturally, these three small books are not without shortcomings. First of all, in the book "American Imperialist Economic Aggression in China," due to the emphasis on statistics and estimates, the insidious nature of American imperialist aggression against China, especially in the chapter on "religious" and "cultural" aggression, is not described enough. The author used figures to prove that imperialists' investment in "cultural" and "charitable" undertakings in China was actually mainly based on the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, and the proportion of money remitted was very small, which is a good analysis. However, the aggressive nature of these "undertakings" and the harm of these undertakings to the Chinese people have not been well analyzed. Perhaps because the author did not have the opportunity to see the materials revealed by various cultural and religious groups in the past year when writing, we hope that this book will be supplemented when it is revised. Secondly, there are also some flaws in processing statistical materials. For example, in the two books "American Imperialist Economic Aggression in China" (pages 1-2) and "British Enterprises in China and Their Profits" (page 5), when quoting long-term statistics on capital exports from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the formalistic grouping method of ten-year periods for raw materials was also cited (although in the latter book, British capital exports were divided into three stages according to major historical events). Also, in the book "Imperialist Investment in China," Appendix 5 regarding the estimate of investment in China by various imperialist countries in 1945 is relatively rough in methodology, and the formulation of the reduction ratio is not well explained. In addition, there are some errors. For example, in the book "British Enterprises in China and Their Profits," the description of the name "Kaiping Company" on page 37 is incorrect. In fact, before the Kaiping Coal Mine was defrauded and occupied by the British, its English name was "Chinese Engineering and Mining Company," not as described in the book, named by the British. When the British defrauded and occupied it, it was agreed that the original Chinese and English names would remain unchanged, only adding the word "Limited" to become a limited company, which was precisely a conspiracy to deceive the Chinese people. On page 40 of "American Imperialist Economic Aggression," the original debt amount of the Qixing Company's Guangdong-Hankou Railway loan was four million pounds, which was later changed to 40 million Chinese currency, but the author wrote 4 million US dollars. On page 20 of the same book, "including 1,500 miles of the Zhuzhou-Qinzhou Railway," the original proposal was 1,500 miles, which was later changed to 1,100 miles, including 700 miles of the Zhuzhou-Qinzhou line and 400 miles of the Zhoujiakou (Henan) to Xiangyang (Hubei) line. (The last two errors were pointed out by Wang Jingyu in "Several Works Related to Imperialist Investment in China," published in the September 1951 issue of "Science Bulletin").

    三本分析帝国主义对华经济侵略的著作
    千家驹
   “帝国主义在华投资”  “美帝在华经济侵略”  “英国在华企业及其利润”  魏子初著  人民出版社出版
    这三本书都是小册子，合计不过一百三十页；但它们却是掌握了相当丰富和广泛的资料，比较系统地和全面地分析了帝国主义对华的经济侵略。
    一百多年来帝国主义者不断地以其血腥的资金投入中国，像吸血管一样吮取着中国人民的血汗，制造了无数的残酷事件；但在我们的历史资料中，却从未见有系统的分析与记载。这三本书的作者从一些真伪莫辩、零星片断的记录中，对帝国主义在华投资和其对中国人民的剥削，做了一个比较全面性的估计。
    这三本书都是充满了数字的书。但作者并不是单纯罗列数字，也不是单纯地分析数字，而是以帝国主义对殖民地的侵略和资本输出的理论为基础，来综合、分析并总结这些统计材料。作者在“帝国主义在华投资”一书中，指出了各帝国主义国家在华投资发展的不平衡性。他根据了历史上的重大事件，如义和团战争、第一次世界大战、“九一八”事变、“七七”事变等划分阶段，分析每一阶段各帝国主义国家在华投资数量和比重的变化，说明了帝国主义资本对中国市场的争夺战；其中特别显示出美帝国主义资本的发展。在该书第二章“投资的特点”中，作者指出这些投资中以直接投资——帝国主义剥削殖民地剩余劳动底直接的和原始的形态——所占成分特别大；同时指出了投资中的超经济掠夺性质——不动产、政治借款、“宗教”“文化”“慈善”等投资；这是和帝国主义在华特权与中国经济的落后性有密切关系的。在分析投资内容上，作者证明约有半数以上的外资是用于商业掠夺性的事业，而用于生产者不过百分之十几；同时指出其投资的地域集中性，这又是与造成中国工业的殖民地倚赖性分不开的。最值得注意的是，作者从外资的来源和利润榨取的分析上证明，外人在华的资金，大部并非来自外国，而是掠夺自中国；不但如此，其自中国所取回去的利润，远超过其所输入的资金。此外，作者对外人投资的高额利润率，及其在各经济部门中所占的比重，以及解放后的变化，也做了一些估计和说明。
    作者所运用的统计资料不是没有缺陷的，尤其是由于系统记录的缺乏，不得不选取帝国主义机构及其“学者”的调查与估计。一般说，这些材料虽经作者相当谨慎的整理和重新估算，其确实性仍然是有限制的。但尽管如此，这些资料对于说明上述那些分析还是极其有力的。统计的运用必须以政治经济学和历史唯物论的理论为基础，不是单纯的从数字找规律。“只有根据科学理解社会现象的本质和工人阶级面前的任务，统计学才能科学地反映实在的社会关系”（“为马克思列宁主义统计理论而斗争”，苏联“统计周报”，一九五○年第二期，查瑞传译）。本书从方法上说，提供了运用统计资料——特别是在我国经济的统计资料一般具有其先天缺陷的情形下——研究经济和历史问题的一个范例。这是值得注意的。因为到目前为止，在我国经济研究工作中还存在着许多追求资产阶级形式数学的、脱离政治经济学和历史唯物论基础的统计方法与倾向。马克思在研究工资率问题上的指示，对我们是具有特殊重要意义的：“只有先了解利润率所依以形成的各种关系，然后可以把统计应用在各时代各国家的工资率之现实的分析上”（资本论，中文本，第三卷上册，页一八○）。本书作者基本上是正确地运用了马克思列宁主义统计学的方法的。
    “美帝在华经济侵略”（实际是美帝国主义在华投资的研究）和“英国在华企业及其利润”二书，实际上是第一本书的分论，即对美、英二国投资更详细地更深入地加以分析。其所用的方法，仍与第一本书一致。作者在这二书中，对于美、英资本输出的历史、特点及其利润，各做了专章研究，取材直到第二次世界大战以后。这些分析证实了列宁对于帝国主义资本输出理论的预见性，同时指明，美国虽是个后起的帝国主义国家，但却是个“成熟”
    （指海外收益超过资本输出）得最快而榨取利润最凶的资本输出国家。
    在关于美国投资中，作者分企业投资、借款投资、“宗教”“文化”投资三方面叙述；在关于英国的投资中，只叙述企业投资，但比较详细，并分析了其资本系统。文字精简、观点清晰、组织有条理，在三本书中都贯串着这些优点。
    自然这三本小书也不是没有缺点的。首先，在“美帝在华经济侵略”一书中，由于偏重了统计和估计，对美帝国主义侵略中国的阴险性，特别是在“宗教”“文化”侵略一章中，叙述得很不够。作者用数字证明了帝国主义在华的“文化”“慈善”等事业投资，实际上是以中国人民的血汗钱为主，汇来的钱所占比重很少，这一分析是好的。但对这些“事业”的侵略性质和这些事业对于中国人民的危害性还没有很好地分析。也许因作者在撰著时没有机会看见最近一年来各地文化宗教等团体所揭发出来的材料，我们希望本书修订时补入。其次，在处理统计材料中也有些缺陷。例如在“美帝对华经济侵略”（页一—二）和“英国在华企业及其利润”（页五）二书中，引用英、美、法等国资本输出的长期统计时，将原材料的十年一期的形式主义分组法也照样引用了（虽然在后一书中对英国的资本输出另按历史重大事件分做三阶段）。又“帝国主义在华投资”一书中，附表五关于一九四五年各帝国主义国家在华投资的估计，方法上比较粗略，缩减比例的拟订，也没有很好地说明。此外，也有若干错误地方。如“英国在华企业及其利润”一书中，第三七页关于“开平公司”名称的叙述是错误的。事实上，开平煤矿在被英人诈骗霸占以前，其英文名称即是“中国工程与矿业公司”，非如该书所述系英人所取名。英人诈骗霸占时约定中英文原名称均不变，只加“有限”字样，改成有限公司，这正是欺矇中国人民的一个阴谋。“美帝在华经济侵略”第四十页，启兴公司粤汉铁路借款原定债额是四百万英镑，后改四千万中国币，作者却写了四百万美金。同书第二十页，“包括一千五百哩的株钦铁路”，实际上原提议是一千五百哩，后改为一千一百哩，包括株钦线七百哩，周（河南周家口）襄（湖北襄阳）线四百哩。（最后两点错误，是汪敬虞在“有关帝国主义在华投资的几种著作”一文中指出的，该文载一九五一年九月“科学通报”）。
