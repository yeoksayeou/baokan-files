    Sichuan 301 Factory Mobilizes the Masses to Reduce Costs
    Overfulfills Production Increase and Savings Plan for the First Half of the Year
    The state-owned Sichuan 301 Factory, in the production increase and savings campaign, reduced product costs by 11.36 percent, overfulfilling the production increase and savings plan for the first half of the year.
    The 301 Factory mainly manufactures potassium chlorate. The cost of producing one ton of potassium chlorate in the first half of this year was lower than last year as follows: electricity consumption decreased from 8,400 kWh to 6,900 kWh, the main raw material potassium chloride decreased from 821 kg to 802 kg, coal decreased from 2.8 tons to 2.3 tons; and management expenses decreased by 20 percent. Savings were also achieved in working capital and stagnant materials. This reduced the total cost of the product.
    The important reason for achieving this result is that the factory leadership, at the beginning of this year, clearly stipulated "reducing costs" as the focus of the production increase and savings campaign, based on the specific situation of the factory. According to this policy, quotas were strictly controlled, the masses were mobilized to practice strict economy, and various methods for saving production costs were proposed. For example, electricity consumption accounts for 30 percent of the cost, and reducing electricity consumption has a significant effect on reducing costs. The leadership immediately called on the masses to "save every kilowatt-hour of electricity and use it in the electrolysis tanks." At the same time, workers were mobilized to improve the electrical wiring, such as removing unused wires and straightening curved lines. Regular inspections of switches and fuses were conducted to prevent leakage. An electricity dispatch team was also organized to be responsible for the allocation of electricity. All employees and their families also voluntarily saved electricity. Last year, lights were left on all night, but now it is stipulated that lights be turned off on time. Electricity consumption for non-production purposes alone has decreased by 54.7 percent compared to last year.
    In terms of auxiliary materials, strict control was also exercised over the control figures for various consumption quotas to achieve maximum savings. Except for the manufacturing department, which exceeded the consumption quota due to the repair of the electrolysis tank that exploded at the beginning of this year, all other departments did not exceed the quota. The labor force was reduced by about 15 percent compared to last year. General reserve materials were compressed to within three months, and the turnover of working capital was 27 days less than last year. Stagnant materials worth a total of 3.4 billion yuan were cleared out, of which 600 million yuan worth has already been processed.
    Another reason for the cost reduction was the development of a mass-based rationalization proposal campaign. In the past six months, the factory adopted 79 rationalization proposals, saving more than 1.5 billion yuan in value. The factory's production increase and savings campaign is continuing.

### 四川三零一厂发动群众降低成本  上半年增产节约计划超额完成

    四川三零一厂发动群众降低成本
    上半年增产节约计划超额完成
    四川省国营三零一厂在增产节约运动中，降低产品成本百分之十一点三六，超额完成上半年的增产节约计划。
    三零一厂以制造氯酸钾为主。今年上半年生产一吨氯酸钾比去年的成本降低如下：电力由八千四百度降为六千九百度，主要原料氯化钾由八百二十一公斤降为八百零二公斤，煤由二点八吨降为二点三吨；管理费用降低百分之二十。在流动资金、呆滞材料方面均有节约。从而降低了产品的总成本。
    取得这个成绩的重要原因，是该厂领导方面本年初就根据该厂具体情况明确规定以“降低成本”为增产节约运动的重点。根据这一方针，严格控制定额，发动群众厉行节约，提出各项节省生产成本的办法。如电力消耗占成本的百分之三十，减少电力消耗对降低成本的作用很大，领导方面即号召群众“节省每一度电，用到电解槽中去”。同时发动工人改进了电线线路，如拆除空线，曲线改直。定期检查开关、保险，防止漏电。并组织了用电调度组负责调配电力。全体职工和家属也自动节约用电，去年通宵开灯，现在规定按时关灯，仅非生产用电就比去年降低百分之五十四点七。
    在辅助材料方面，也严格掌握各项消费定额的控制数字，做到最大限度的节约。全厂各部门除制造所因检修今年初爆炸的电解槽超出了消费定额以外，其余各部门均未超出。劳动力比去年减少百分之十五左右。一般储备材料压缩到三个月以内，流动资金的周转比去年少二十七天。清理出的呆滞材料共值三十四亿元，其中已处理的值六亿元。
    成本降低的另一原因是开展了群众性的合理化建议运动。半年来该厂共采用合理化建议七十九件，节约价值在十五亿元以上。现该厂增产节约运动正继续开展中。
