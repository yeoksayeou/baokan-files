    Do a Good Job Preparing for Winter Wheat Sowing
    The winter wheat sowing season is only a little over a month away. Preparations for sowing need to begin immediately. In the sowing preparations, in addition to accumulating fertilizer, the most important tasks are land preparation and the promotion of improved varieties.
    The key content of land preparation is plowing and cultivation. The purpose of plowing is to fully store summer rainwater and expand the weathering surface of the soil, increasing the effective nutrients in the soil. Therefore, it is not necessary to harrow and roll after each plowing. Too many harrowing and rolling operations may damage the granular structure of the soil. However, when a hard crust forms on the ground after rain, it is essential to harrow to aerate the soil. It is not necessary to deep plow every time. The first plowing should be deep, preferably no less than seven inches (some farmers do not have new-style walking plows, and after plowing with ordinary plows, they follow closely with a plow without a moldboard from the furrow to plow again to increase the depth, this method is worth promoting); the second plowing can be five or six inches deep; the last plowing can be less than five inches, and should be done fifteen to twenty days before sowing. There are two benefits to doing this: first, it allows each layer of soil to be turned to the surface for full weathering; second, it avoids damaging the young roots of crops when soil settles during simultaneous plowing and sowing. For land with previous crops (such as millet, corn, etc.), cultivation work should be done well. This is not only to make the millet and corn grow well, but also to prepare conditions for wheat sowing. The number of cultivation operations depends on the conditions of rain, soil, etc. Too many cultivation operations will excessively damage the soil structure, which has the same result as too few cultivation operations. The depth of cultivation should also go from deep to shallow, and the last cultivation should not exceed the depth of wheat sowing. It should be recognized that "deep plowing and fine harrowing" does not mean unlimitedly increasing the number of plowing and harrowing operations. Technical guidance must closely integrate scientific principles with actual situations and farmers' experience. It is not enough to conduct agricultural technical guidance based solely on a simplified slogan of "intensive cultivation and meticulous farming."
    Regarding the promotion of improved varieties, government procurement and lending can only be supplementary methods. The main method is to organize the masses to exchange seeds with each other. In order to do a good job in seed exchange, first of all, it is necessary to patiently and extensively conduct propaganda and education among farmers to make them generally recognize the importance of improved varieties, and use this year's examples to break the conservative thinking of some farmers. Secondly, farmers should be educated not to use wheat that has suffered from diseases and pests this year as seeds. Leaders in disaster areas should quickly help the disaster victims solve the problem of food rations and ensure that the high-quality seeds selected during this year's summer harvest are used for sowing. In order to promote the experience of close planting, some more seeds should be prepared appropriately. In addition, it must be noted that the principle of promoting improved varieties is to promote them locally. Improved varieties from other regions should not be easily promoted on a large scale until they have been successfully tested locally. Varieties that have achieved high yields locally for many years are varieties that are suitable for local climate, soil and other conditions, and should be further improved through continuous selection every year, rather than randomly replacing them with other varieties.
    Ensure that Every New-Style Walking Plow Plays its Role
    New-style walking plows have already played a huge role in agricultural production and are welcomed by the masses. In many areas, there has been a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand. However, some new-style farm implements have not yet played their due role. For example, some new-style walking plows have been stored in supply and marketing agencies for a long time without being sold to farmers. Some cadres only mobilize the masses to buy new-style walking plows, but cannot explain their benefits, nor do they know how to use and repair them. Some farmers bought new-style walking plows, tried them out, and felt that they were not as "smooth" to use as old plows, so they put them aside. In areas where the promotion of new-style farm implements has been relatively successful, some of these situations have also occurred; as for areas where the promotion has been worse, the situation is even more serious. Now our farm implement factories have limited production capacity. Under these circumstances, if we cannot give full play to the role of new-style walking plows that have already been produced, this is not only a major loss at present, but it will also affect the future work of further promoting new-style walking plows. In all areas where this situation has occurred, the leadership must seize the opportunity to conduct inspections, strengthen technical guidance, and organize comparative experiments between new and old plows, so that every new-style walking plow can play its due role. Only in this way can we pave the way for further promotion of new-style farm implements.

    经济生活简评
    作好冬小麦播种的准备工作
    现在离秋种小麦的季节只有一个多月了。播种的准备工作需要马上进行了。在播种准备工作中，除了积肥之外，最重要的是整地和推广良种。
    整地的重要内容是犁地和中耕。犁地的目的是充分储存夏季雨水和扩大土壤的风化面，增加土壤的有效养分。因此，不必在每次犁地之后都进行耙、耱。耙、耱次数太多，可能破坏土壤的团粒结构。但在雨后地面形成硬壳时，则一定要耙，使之通风。犁地时不必每次都实行深耕。第一次是应当深耕的，最好不少于七寸（有些农民没有新式步犁，他们用普通犁犁过后，紧跟着用一张不带犁面的犁，从犁沟中再犁一道以增加深度，这个办法值得推广）；第二次可犁五、六寸深；最后一次可少于五寸，并在播种前十五天到二十天进行。这样做有两个好处，第一是使每层土壤都能翻到地面，充分风化；第二是避免随耕随种、土壤沉实时，损害作物的幼根。有前作物（如谷子、玉米等）的土地，应把中耕工作做好。这不只是为了使谷子、玉米长得好，而且是给小麦播种准备条件。中耕次数的多少，要看雨水、土壤等条件来决定。中耕次数太多，也会过分破坏土壤结构，和中耕次数太少的结果是一样的。中耕深度也应由深而浅，最后一次不可超过小麦播种的深度。应该认识，“深犁细耙”决不是无限制地增加耕耙次数。进行技术指导要把科学的道理和实际的情况、农民的经验密切结合起来。只凭一个简单化的“精耕细作”的口号去进行农业技术指导是不行的。
    关于推广良种，由政府收购和贷放还只能是辅助的方式，主要的方法是组织群众互相调换。为了做好调剂种籽工作，首先要耐心地广泛地对农民进行宣传教育工作，使农民普遍认识改良品种的重要性，用今年的实例，打破若干农民的保守思想。其次要教育广大农民不要用今年得了病虫害的小麦作种籽。灾区的领导方面应当赶快帮助灾民解决口粮问题，保证把今年夏收时选出的优良种籽用来播种。为了推广密植经验，应该适当地多准备一些种籽。此外必须注意，推广良种以就地推广为原则，其他地区的优良种籽，在本地试种成功以前，不要轻易地大量推广。在当地连年获得高产量的品种，就是适合当地的气候、土壤等条件的品种，应当从年年精选中再求提高，而不要随便换用其他品种。
    要使每一张新式步犁都发挥作用
    新式步犁已经在农业生产上发挥了巨大的作用，受到广大群众的欢迎。很多地区发生了供不应求的现象。但有若干新式农具，却还没有发挥应有的作用。例如，有些新式步犁在供销机关存放很久，没有推销到农民手里。有的干部只是动员群众购买新式步犁，但说不出它有什么好处，也不懂得怎么使用和怎样修理。有些农民买了新式步犁，试用了一下，觉得还没有旧犁用着“顺手”，就放下不用了。在推广新式农具成绩较好的地区，还有一些地方发生了这样的情况；至于推广成绩较坏的地区，其情形就更严重了。现在我们的农具工厂的生产能力还很有限，在这种情况下，如果不能把已经生产出来的新式步犁的作用充分发挥出来，这不仅在目前是一种重大的损失，而且也会影响今后进一步推广新式步犁的工作。凡是发生了这种情况的地区，领导方面一定要抓紧进行检查，加强技术指导，组织新犁旧犁的对比试验，使每一张新式步犁都发挥出它应有的作用。只有这样，才能为进一步推广新式农具开辟道路。
