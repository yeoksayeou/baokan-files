TASS, New York, August 14th: "Chicago Daily News" reporter Leahy reported: The small number of listeners at Eisenhower's first speech after being nominated by the Republican Party as a candidate for the US presidency made his campaign leaders feel uneasy. On the evening of August 5th, when Eisenhower gave a speech at the Los Angeles Grand Theater, which can accommodate more than 100,000 people, only one or two thousand people attended. Leahy described Eisenhower's journey through the deserted streets to reach the Grand Theater. He said that the scene of Eisenhower and his entourage arriving at the Grand Theater was simply a splash of cold water, chilling his entourage and sympathizers. Eisenhower sat in the front seat of the car and, according to a pre-arranged plan, circled the venue, waving and smiling. When he mechanically waved to the deserted Grand Theater, you realized that he was the loneliest presidential candidate in history. Leahy concluded by writing that this failed bubble show of the Republican presidential candidate, "out of pity for him, it is best not to record it in history."

    艾森豪威尔竞选的可怜相
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：“芝加哥每日新闻”记者莱希报道：艾森豪威尔被共和党提名为美国总统候选人后发表第一次演说时，听者寥寥，这使他的竞选运动的主持人大感不安。八月五日晚间，艾森豪威尔在可容十多万人的洛杉矶大剧场发表演说，只有一两万人到场。莱希描写了艾森豪威尔穿过冷清清的街道到达大剧场的情形。他说，艾森豪威尔及其随从到达大剧场的场面简直是一瓢冷水，使他的随从和他的同情者为之寒心。艾森豪威尔坐在汽车的前座，按照事先想好的计划，绕场一周，挥手微笑。当他机械地向冷清清的大剧场四周依次挥手示意的时候，你便觉察出，他是历史上最寂寞的总统候选人。莱希最后写道，共和党总统候选人这出失败的打泡戏，为了“可怜他，最好别载入史册”。
