    Leadership Cadres in Certain Organs of Hengyang City Neglect Reading Newspapers and Learning

    Editor: The reading and learning of newspapers by cadres in various organs in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, lacks leadership, and some leading cadres do not pay attention to reading and learning newspapers. A test we recently held revealed many cadres' misconceptions. Many cadres did not know the significance and content of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing. Comrade Ying Shanhong, the propaganda minister of the Hengyang City Work Committee of the Communist Youth League, answered this question by saying, "The meeting seems to have discussed economic exchanges, cultural exchanges, and opposition to germ warfare, etc." Many people were also unaware of the French government's illegal arrest of French Communist Party leader Duclos. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a telegram of condolences to the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and various democratic parties issued protest telegrams, Zhou Anyi, deputy director of the Municipal Taxation Bureau, Zhang Xiaoliang, deputy chief of the Municipal Government Personnel Section, and Yang Xingzhou, deputy director of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, and others still did not know about this matter.

    It is difficult to do a good job in reading and learning newspapers by ordinary cadres if the leading cadres do not pay attention to reading and learning newspapers. We have instructed the branches of various organs to strengthen the organization and leadership of reading and learning newspapers, and will specifically study and solve the problem. Propaganda Department of the Hengyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    衡阳市某些机关的领导干部忽视读报学习
    编辑同志：湖南省衡阳市各机关干部的读报学习都缺乏领导，某些领导干部也不重视读报学习。我们最近举行的一次测验，揭露了很多干部的错误认识。很多干部不知道在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的意义和内容，青年团衡阳市工作委员会宣传部长应山红同志对这个问题的答案是“会议好像是讨论了经济交流，文化交流和反对细菌战争等问题”。对于法国政府非法逮捕法共领袖杜克洛的事件，很多人也不知道。在中共中央发表了致法共中央的慰问电，各民主党派发表了抗议电文以后，市税务局副局长周安一、市府人事科副科长张效亮、市财政经济委员会副主任杨兴洲等还不知道这件事情。
    领导干部都不重视读报学习，要搞好一般干部的读报学习是困难的。我们已指示各机关支部加强读报学习的组织与领导，并将具体研究解决这个问题的办法。中共衡阳市委宣传部
