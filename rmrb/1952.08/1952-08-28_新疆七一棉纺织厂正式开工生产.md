Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory Officially Starts Production

The construction project of the Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory, after more than a year of efforts by an engineering construction unit of the People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region and technical workers, engineers, and experts, has been successfully completed and officially started production in early July.

The July 1st Cotton Textile Factory is large in scale and has complete equipment. The factory buildings are all built of steel-reinforced concrete and are equipped with ventilation, spraying, heating, and running water facilities. The textile machines are all new-style machines. All commanders and fighters, workers, engineers, and experts who participated in this factory construction project worked with a high degree of enthusiasm to build the frontier of the motherland and assist the people of Xinjiang from beginning to end, overcame countless difficulties, and completed the construction task ahead of schedule. All the soldiers of a certain engineering construction unit who were in charge of logging worked non-stop during the "cold wave" to ensure the supply of timber for the factory construction, braving the severe cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius to fell trees on the Tianshan Mountains while lying on ice. Thanks to the soldiers' display of high labor enthusiasm and improved operating skills, production efficiency increased rapidly. The soldiers of the Seventh Company created a new record of pouring two column bases in half an hour in the construction of the concrete pillar foundation. Bulldozer operators drove vehicles on the rocky foothills, setting a record of pushing more than 400 cubic meters of soil in eight hours a day. The training team launched a red flag competition in paving the foundation, increasing from loading more than 50 trucks of soil per shift per day to more than 90 trucks per shift per day. The soldiers in charge of bricklaying improved their work efficiency by more than double after learning the Soviet Stakhanov method of bricklaying. In the installation of machinery, with everyone working together, the difficulties of not having unloading workers and the lack of sleepers, spikes, and rails were overcome, and the machines were quickly installed.

In the past, Xinjiang did not have a textile factory, and the working people had to wear rough and non-durable homespun cloth woven by hand. In the future, they can wear fine cloth produced by the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory.

### 新疆七一棉纺织厂正式开工生产

    新疆七一棉纺织厂正式开工生产
    新疆七一棉纺织厂建筑工程，经过人民解放军新疆军区某工程建设部队及技术工人、工程师、专家等年余努力，已胜利竣工，并于七月初正式开工生产。
    七一棉纺织厂规模宏大，设备完善。厂房全用钢骨水泥建成，装有通风、喷雾、暖气、自来水等设备。纺织机器全系新式机器。参加这一建厂工程的全体指战员和职工、工程师、专家们，自始至终抱着建设祖国边疆，援助新疆人民的高度热情进行工作，战胜了无数的困难，做到提前完成修建任务。某工程建设部队担任伐木工作的全体战士，为保证建厂木材的供应，在“寒潮”侵袭期间也不停工，冒着零下四十度的严寒，在天山上卧冰伐木。由于战士们发挥了高度的劳动热情，和操作技术的提高，生产效率飞速上升。七连战士在筑洋灰柱基中，创造了一个半钟头灌筑两个柱基的新纪录。推土机手，在山麓岩石上驾驶机车，创一天八小时推土四百多立方的纪录。教导队在垫地基中，展开了夺红旗运动，由每天每班装五十多车土，提高到每天每班装九十多车。负担砌砖工程的战士，自学习了苏联斯达哈诺夫的砌砖法后，工作效率提高一倍多。在安装机器中，在大家一齐动手下，克服了没有卸车工人及缺乏枕木、道钉、铁轨等的困难，把机器迅速安装起来。
    新疆过去因为没有纺织厂，劳动人民只得穿自己手工织的粗糙而又不耐久的土布，今后他们可以穿上七一棉纺织厂出产的细布了。
