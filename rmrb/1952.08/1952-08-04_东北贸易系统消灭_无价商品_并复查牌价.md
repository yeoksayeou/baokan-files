    Northeast State-Owned Trade System Eliminates "Priceless Commodities" and Reviews Price Tags
    Since May, the Northeast state-owned trade system has launched a campaign to "eliminate priceless commodities" and "review price tags." Up to now, more than a thousand "priceless commodities" in six major cities in the region have been given reasonable prices, and commodities with previously unreasonable prices have also been adjusted.
    In the work of eliminating priceless commodities in various parts of Northeast China, pricing staff were mobilized to meet with warehouse keepers and salespersons in warehouses and grassroots business departments to jointly inspect commodities and discuss pricing on the spot. When pricing, the pricing staff actively tried to find ways, study market conditions in producing areas, consult historical prices, refer to prices of various similar commodities, and repeatedly study with relevant specialized technical personnel. For example, the 80 kinds of commodities that had been stockpiled by the Northeast Industrial Equipment Company for six months without being priced were given reasonable prices after experts from the Northeast Institute of Technology and personnel from the Instrument Department of the China Medical University inspected them.
    In the work of reviewing price tags, the Northeast Trade Department and the commercial departments and bureaus of various provinces organized review teams to conduct key spot checks on professional companies in various places. In addition, various localities mobilized salespersons to expose slow pricing and unreasonable price tags, and organized joint meetings of pricing, warehousing, and sales personnel to jointly study prices based on sales conditions, variety ratios, regional price differences, customer feedback, and market prices. Shenyang City adopted this method to adjust 213 unreasonable price tags.
    Through this review, pricing cadres have further improved their policy and professional levels. All units have strengthened their pricing institutions. The pricing staff of Shenyang Department Store goes to the sales groups of various grassroots units every day to understand the situation, and generally resolves problems within three days after they are discovered. In order to ensure timely and accurate pricing in the future, the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government issued a draft of a price work liaison system in early June, stipulating that the allocation units must ensure that goods and prices go together. After the pricing units of various city and county companies receive the price notification from the allocation units, they should set reasonable selling prices on the same day and submit them to the sales units to which they belong.

### 东北贸易系统消灭“无价商品”并复查牌价

    东北贸易系统消灭“无价商品”并复查牌价
    东北国营贸易系统自五月以来展开了“消灭无价商品”和“复查牌价”运动。到目前止，全区六个主要城市，已把一千多种“无价商品”作出合理价格；以前牌价不合理的商品也作了调整。
    东北各地在消灭无价商品工作中，发动了物价工作人员到仓库及基层营业部与保管员、营业员见面，共同检查商品，就地商讨作价。在作价时，物价员积极地想办法，研究产地行情，查阅历史价格，参考各种类似商品价格，并请有关的专门技术人员反复研究。如东北区工业器材公司过去积压六个月而未作价的八十种商品，就是请东北工学院专家和中国医科大学仪器科人员检验后，订出合理价格的。
    在复查牌价工作中，东北贸易部、各省商业厅商业局都组织了复查组，对各地专业公司进行了重点抽查。此外，各地并发动营业员揭发作价迟缓和牌价不合理现象，组织物价、保管、营业员的碰头会议，根据销售情况、品种比值、地区差价、顾客反映和市场价格等各方面的参考材料共同研究牌价。沈阳市采取这种办法调整了二百十三种不合理的牌价。
    经过这次复查，物价干部进一步提高了政策水平和业务水平。各单位都加强了物价机构。沈阳市百货公司物价员每天都深入各基层单位的卖货组了解情况，发现问题后一般的都在三天内予以解决。为使今后作价及时和正确，东北人民政府贸易部在六月初颁发了物价工作联系制度草案，规定拨货单位必须保证货、价同行，各市县公司作价单位收到拨货单位的拨付价通知后，应在当日内作出合理售价，交到所属售货单位。    （新华社）
