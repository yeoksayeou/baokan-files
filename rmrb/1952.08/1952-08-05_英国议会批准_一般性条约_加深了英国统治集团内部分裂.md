    Xinhua News Agency, London, August 4th: The British Parliament's House of Commons approved the "General Treaty" signed by the United States, Britain, France, and the West German puppet government on August 1st.

    The "General Treaty," aimed at rearming West Germany, has caused long-term disputes within the British ruling group. Many figures, including Labour Party leaders, on the one hand, feared that approving this treaty would inevitably provoke fierce opposition from the British people, and on the other hand, worried that a revived German militarism would seriously threaten British interests; therefore, they advocated a delaying tactic. In the two-day debate held in the House of Commons, British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered two speeches within twenty-four hours, trying his best to defend the treaty in an attempt to win the support of the largest possible number of members of Parliament. However, the voting results showed that among the more than five hundred members of Parliament who participated in the vote, two hundred and fifty-three voted against approving the "General Treaty." The Conservative government barely managed to pass the motion to approve the treaty with a limited majority of forty votes. Prior to the vote, Labour Party members also put forward a motion of censure, arguing that approval was "inopportune." United Press International's London dispatch on August 1st believed that the British House of Commons' approval of the "General Treaty" deepened the divisions within the British ruling group.

    Labour Party leader Dalton's speech in the House of Commons on August 1st reflected the widespread anxiety and unease within the British ruling group. Dalton said that approving the "General Treaty" was "acting against the will of the British people." He also said: "British public opinion is not only unenthusiastic but also extremely disgusted with the proposal to quickly rearm Germany."

    英国议会批准“一般性条约”
    加深了英国统治集团内部分裂
    【新华社四日讯】伦敦消息：英国议会下院在八月一日批准了美英法三国和西德傀儡政府签订的“一般性条约”。
    以重新武装西德为目的的“一般性条约”，曾经在英国统治集团内部引起长期的争论。包括工党领导分子在内的许多人物，一方面害怕批准这个条约势必引起英国人民的激烈反对，另一方面又担心复活了的德国军国主义会严重威胁英国的利益；因此主张采取拖延的办法。在这次下院举行的两天辩论中，英国外交大臣艾登在二十四小时之内两次发表演说，竭力替这个条约辩护，企图争取下院最大多数议员的支持。但是表决结果，在参加投票的五百多名议员中仍然有二百五十三名投票反对批准“一般性条约”。保守党政府仅仅以四十票的有限多数票勉强使建议批准这个条约的动议获得通过。在表决以前，工党议员并提出谴责案，认为批准一举“不合时宜”。合众社伦敦一日电认为：英国下院批准“一般性条约”，加深了英国统治集团内部的分裂。
    工党领导人物之一达尔顿一日在下院的发言，反映了英国统治集团内部广泛的忧虑不安情绪。达尔顿说，批准“一般性条约”是“违反英国人民意志而行事的”。他又说：“英国舆论对于迅速重新武装德国的主张，不但不热心而且十分厌恶。”
