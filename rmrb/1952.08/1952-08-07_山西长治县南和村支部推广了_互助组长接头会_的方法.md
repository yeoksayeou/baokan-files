    In the spring drought prevention campaign, Nanhe Village, Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, established many mutual aid teams. However, because the wages within the teams were set too low, some people requested to withdraw. Liu Fulin, the branch secretary, sought advice from labor model Wang Dingxiang. Coincidentally, Wang Dingxiang had just returned from a mutual aid team representative meeting held by the special commissioner and was eager to lead the village's mutual aid teams effectively. When Liu Fulin raised the issue of consolidating the mutual aid teams, Wang Dingxiang proposed establishing a "mutual aid team leader liaison meeting" combined with the labor model network to exchange experiences within the village, learn from experiences of other villages, and promote the village's mutual aid and cooperative movement. Liu Fulin thought about it and felt this was a very good idea. He then brought it up at a meeting of all village cadres for discussion. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to adopt and promote it.

    The first mutual aid team leader liaison meeting was hosted by Liu Fulin and others. At this meeting, Wang Dingxiang and the team leaders discussed the issue of adjusting wages and proposed new suggestions. After these suggestions were implemented, the idea of everyone withdrawing and disbanding the teams quickly changed. In this way, everyone felt that the mutual aid team leader liaison meeting was very good and requested that such meetings be held frequently. Wang Dingxiang was elected as the convener of the liaison meeting. At the same time, it was requested that Wang Dingxiang solicit opinions from the team leaders the night before attending the labor model meeting at the Nangou Agricultural Production Cooperative, and after returning, hold a liaison meeting to convey the circumstances of the meeting discussions. From then on, the "mutual aid team leader liaison meeting" became an important method for the branch to lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    The "mutual aid team leader liaison meeting" is also a good way to promote advanced experiences. For example, at the second liaison meeting, Wang Dingxiang introduced the advanced experiences of the Nangou Agricultural Production Cooperative in organization, leadership, and life arrangements, solving the problem of the mutual aid teams' "varying progress of work." From then on, everyone felt they had a way to improve the mutual aid teams.

    As the sowing was about to be completed, Wang Dingxiang, according to the branch's instructions, convened another liaison meeting. At the meeting, Wang Dingxiang introduced his team's experience in fine and careful cultivation, and each team also checked its own farming situation. The inspection revealed that some teams lacked sufficient manure and soil, and their cultivation was rough. Everyone agreed that these shortcomings should be improved. This allowed each team to naturally learn from the experience of Wang Dingxiang's team.

    Due to the branch's good leadership of mutual aid and cooperation, thirteen more teams have been added to the village, and many teams want to emulate Wang Dingxiang's team. Currently, a heated patriotic production increase competition is underway between all teams and among the teams.

### 山西长治县南和村支部推广了“互助组长接头会”的方法

    山西长治县南和村支部推广了“互助组长接头会”的方法
    山西长治县南和村在春天防旱运动中，成立了很多互助组；但因组内工资定得太低，有些人要求退组，支部书记刘福林就去找劳动模范王定祥研究。恰好王定祥刚从专署开互助组代表会议回来，有心要把全村互助组领导好。当刘福林提出巩固互助组的问题时，王定祥就提出建立一个和劳动模范网相结合的“互助组长接头会”，以交流本村经验，学习外村经验，推动全村互助合作运动。刘福林想了一想，觉得这个办法很好。于是把它提到全村干部会议上去讨论。讨论结果，决定采用推广。
    第一次互助组长接头会是由刘福林等主持的。在这次会议上，王定祥和各组长研究了调整工资的问题，并提出了新的意见。这意见实行后，很快就改变了大家退组散伙的思想。这样，大家都觉得这个互助组长接头会很好，要求经常召开这种会议；并选举王定祥为接头会的召集人。同时要求王定祥每逢到南沟农业生产合作社参加劳动模范会议的前一夜，要徵求各组意见；回来后，开接头会传达会议讨论的情形。从此，“互助组长接头会”就成为支部领导互助合作运动的一种重要方法。
    “互助组长接头会”还是推广先进经验的一种好形式。例如在第二次接头会上，王定祥介绍了南沟农业生产合作社组织领导和安排生活的先进经验，解决了互助组“做活先后”的问题，从此大家觉得搞好互助组有了门道。
    当下种将要完毕的时候，王定祥根据支部的指示，又召开了一次接头会议。会上，王定祥介绍了本组的加工细作的经验，各组也都检查了自己的耕作情况。检查结果，发现有些组的粪土不足，耕作粗糙，大家认为这些缺点应当改进。这样使各组很自然地学习了王定祥组的经验。
    由于支部对互助合作领导得好，全村又增加了十三个组，并有许多组要向王定祥组看齐。目前全村组和组间展开了热烈的爱国增产竞赛运动。
