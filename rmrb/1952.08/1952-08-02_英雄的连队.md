    Heroic Company
    Chen Shuli
    The Eleventh Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a heroic company with a glorious history. Its predecessor was the Fifth Company of the Twelfth Regiment of the Fourth Division of the Third Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led by General Peng Dehuai. For twenty-three years, although its designation has changed several times, it has always maintained and carried forward the glorious traditions and fine combat style of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.
    During the five anti-encirclement campaigns in the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the Eleventh Company was one of the main Red Army companies defending the Central Soviet Area; it also made many military exploits during the world-shaking 25,000-li Long March. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, it fought in the Northeast, Northwest, North China, East China, Central South, and Southwest regions, participating in the famous Battle of Pingxingguan, Huaihai Campaign, Yangtze River Crossing Campaign, and the march into the Great Southwest, winning successive victories and writing a brilliant history with blood. Therefore, people habitually use the glorious title of "banner of victory" to praise this heroic company. Now, I will write down fragments of the Eleventh Company's glorious achievements below.

    Raising the Banner of Victory
    In the winter of 1935, after the Central Red Army and the Shaanxi-Gansu Red Army joined forces, they organized the famous Battle of Zhiluozhen (in Fu County, Shaanxi). This battle played a significant role in crushing the Kuomintang bandit army's encirclement and suppression of the Shaanxi-Gansu revolutionary base area. In this battle, the Eleventh Company, as a commando, bravely broke through the enemy's defensive position, opened the way for the assault, and enabled our army to completely annihilate the Kuomintang bandit army's 109th Division, thereby completely crushing the enemy's encirclement.
    After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang army collapsed at the mere sight of the enemy and retreated without a fight; the Japanese invaders were arrogant and rampant. On September 23, 1937, the Japanese invaders launched a large-scale attack on the Pingxingguan-Yanmenguan line, attempting to go straight to Taiyuan. The Eighth Route Army, which had gone north to resist Japan, organized the outstanding Battle of Pingxingguan at this time. In this outstanding battle, the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army, commanded by General Lin Biao, surrounded more than 4,000 men of a brigade of the Japanese invaders' elite main force, the Itagaki Division, and annihilated more than 3,000 men. This severely hit the Japanese invaders' aggressive ferocity and boosted the confidence of the people throughout the country in victory. The Eleventh Company, which was then under the 115th Division, repeatedly charged and fought hand-to-hand with the Japanese invaders, fought fiercely all day long, repelled the enemy's several counterattacks, and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy.

    Fighting in the Jiangsu-Shandong-Hebei-Henan Area
    During the long War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eleventh Company always undertook the most arduous combat tasks. It fought in the Jiangsu-Shandong-Hebei-Henan area, victoriously protecting the people and打击the Japanese invaders and puppet troops.
    The "Liangshan Annihilation Battle" in August 1939 played an important role in opening up and consolidating the Luxi Anti-Japanese Base Area. In this battle, the Eleventh Company served as a commando. The entire company first broke through the enemy's defense line, rushed into the enemy's阵地, and engaged in a bayonet charge with the Japanese invaders. Finally, together with fraternal companies, it created a model example of annihilating a Japanese invaders'大队 with one battalion, killing and wounding more than 400 Japanese invaders including the大队长 and others, and seizing three cannons and some other military supplies.
    In April 1942, the soldiers and civilians of the anti-Japanese base area were busy harvesting wheat. The Japanese army launched a joint encirclement attack from Shan County, Dangshan, and Yucheng on Yuezhai, the central area of the anti-Japanese base area. One day at dawn, the Eleventh Company was covering the transfer of the regimental headquarters when it unexpectedly encountered the Japanese invaders on the dam between Menglou and Yuezhai. A fierce counter-"mopping-up" battle began. Although the heroes took the combat action of deploying before the enemy and opening fire before the enemy, they were surrounded by the enemy's more than 50 vehicles and more than 1,000 troops (later increased to more than 3,000) after all, because of the disparity in strength. This was a serious test for the Eleventh Company. However, the commanders and combatants of the Eleventh Company were all brave and resourceful heroes armed with a high degree of patriotism. Everyone exhorted each other: "The task is important, the situation is serious, pay attention to using the terrain to preserve ourselves, save ammunition; with the greatest determination to sacrifice, wit, and courage, prepare to persist until the higher authorities need us to persist..." The party branch secretary stood at the forefront of the battle, calling on the communists to resolutely complete the task of covering the regimental headquarters. He said: As long as we have one person and one gun in the Eleventh Company, we will guarantee the safe transfer of the regimental leaders and direct organs. The warriors, relying on the Yellow River levee, launched a fierce battle with the enemy. Wounded soldiers did not leave the line of fire. Model health worker Li Yande was seriously wounded while bandaging the wounded. At this time, the enemy's tank drove towards him, and he still tried his best to push his comrades out of danger. When other comrades discovered that his leg had been crushed by the tank and went to rescue him, he still encouraged his comrades: "Don't worry about me, fight hard, kill a few more enemies to avenge me!"
    In the overwhelming sandstorm, the warriors fought for eight hours, repelling the Japanese invaders' frantic attacks again and again, forcing the heavily wounded enemy to stop attacking. The heroes seized this favorable opportunity and launched a fierce counterattack in two directions. This sudden action stunned the enemy, and the heroes successfully broke through the encirclement.
    The enemy's "joint sweep" was crushed. The Eleventh Company fought fiercely with thousands of enemies for a whole day with a small number of troops, destroying two enemy vehicles with eight casualties, and the wounded and killed devils completely filled three cars.
    In the autumn of 1944, in order to save the people in the occupied areas and consolidate and expand the anti-Japanese base areas, our army launched an offensive against the enemy. In the Battle of Weilou (now in Pei County, Shandong), the Eleventh Company again accepted the glorious task of突击. The warriors crossed three outer moats within minutes,拔毁鹿砦, and successfully climbed the more than 30-foot-high stockade wall. However, we only had three warriors occupying the breakthrough, but the enemy launched counterattacks with the strength of entire companies and platoons. The situation was quite critical. At this moment, Comrade Xu Guangfu, who had been wounded, stood up bravely, braved the enemy's dense artillery fire, and threw nearly a hundred grenades in succession in more than ten minutes, and finally defeated the enemy's several counterattacks with bayonet charges, consolidated the breakthrough, and enabled the follow-up troops to rush into the围砦and quickly wiped out the enemy. Xu Guangfu was therefore known as the first-class enemy-killing hero of the Jiluyu Military Region - the Iron Hero. Due to this victorious battle, our army recovered more than 200 square miles of land in less than a month.

    From Victory to Victory
    In the autumn of 1945, after the Japanese invaders announced their surrender, they still stubbornly resisted our army. In order to disarm the enemy army, the Jiluyu Military Region部队launched attacks one after another. In the battle to forcibly attack Changyuan County, the warriors of the Eleventh Company突进into the city in five minutes, defeating four counterattacks by the Japanese and puppet troops, expanding the breakthrough, and ensuring the victory of the battle. In this battle, our army completely annihilated more than 3,000 enemy troops.
    After the Japanese invaders surrendered, in the war against the Kuomintang bandit army's attack on the liberated areas, the Eleventh Company went north out of the Great Wall and fought in the Jicha-Sui area. In the Zhangjiakou defense battle, the Eleventh Company held on to the Maopaquan mountain, containing two battalions of the enemy's forces; although there was no food to eat or water to drink, they persisted in the battle for a whole day, and captured two American-style mountain guns from the enemy, forcing the attacking enemy to abandon many corpses and a large number of military supplies and flee in panic.

    Breaking Through the Natural Barrier of the Yangtze River
    On April 21, 1949, the People's Liberation Army resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to advance bravely and liberate the whole country, and launched the Yangtze River Crossing battle on a thousand-li front.
    Dense artillery fire fiercely bombarded the Jiangnan Chiang bandit army's defense line. The assault boats of the Eleventh Company heroes sailed towards the south bank like arrows.
    Thousands of boats advanced rapidly. The assault boat of the Eleventh Company always sailed in the forefront. When the boat passed the center of the river, the enemy began to shoot fiercely. The heroes of the Eleventh Company calmly fought back while speeding up the boat and quickly sailing to the south bank. As soon as the Ji Fengxiang班landed, they pounced on the enemy's bunker and planted the first red flag on the top of Junshan Mountain. The natural barrier of the Yangtze River, on which the Kuomintang bandit army finally relied, was broken through by the heroes in 25 minutes. After the end of the campaign, the师党委会gave the Eleventh Company the glorious title of "Heroic Company that First Planted the Red Flag in Jiangnan and Broke Through the Natural Barrier of the Yangtze River."

    Forcibly Attacking the Natural Barrier of Lijiazhai
    In the triangular area of Tongzi, Xishui, and Renhuai counties in Guizhou Province, there is a towering mountain peak, known as "Tianxian Lijiazhai." On the mountain peak, there is a man-eating "feudal kingdom," which heavily weighs on the heads of the people in northeastern Guizhou. The headquarters of the Chiang bandit army's "5th Column of the Sichuan-Guizhou Border Anti-Communist Salvation Army" is attached to this dangerous寨, ruling the people within eighty li around. After the Eleventh Company marched into the Great Southwest, it accepted the task of attacking Lijiazhai in the execution of bandit suppression tasks.
    Lijiazhai is indeed a dangerous寨that is not easy to攻下. More than 300 bandits固守inside the寨. The east and north sides of the寨are cliffs as high as 800 meters, and the south and west sides are steep slopes of 60 to 70 li. There are three stockade walls and four bunkers on the寨.
    The attack began. The heroes of the Eleventh Company moved forward wave upon wave, fought bravely, and successively captured two stockade walls, compressing all the bandits within the third stockade wall. Hero Liang Jingxi had been wounded twice when he突击the second stockade wall; but strong class hatred supported him, he broke into the third stockade wall with serious injuries, and used grenades to cover the comrades' attack, while encouraging everyone to advance bravely. At this moment, he was unfortunately seriously wounded for the third time and heroically sacrificed. The warriors of the Eleventh Company stepped on the heroes' blood and finally completely destroyed this feudal fortress that had been weighing on the people's heads for thousands of years.
    Although the Eleventh Company has made such outstanding contributions to the revolutionary cause, they have not become complacent because of this. In military training and the execution of other glorious tasks, they have continued to achieve new victories. At present, the heroes are carrying out new tasks of further modernization and regularization, and are advancing victoriously to improve culture and increase scientific knowledge, improve military technology and tactics, defend the motherland, and defend Asian and world peace!

    英雄的连队
    陈树立
    中国人民解放军某部十一连是一个有着光辉历史的英雄连队。它的前身是彭德怀将军领导的中国工农红军三军团四师十二团的第五连。二十三年来，番号虽几经改变，但它始终保持着并发扬了中国工农红军的光荣传统和优良的战斗作风。
    在第二次国内革命战争时期的五次反围攻斗争中，十一连是保卫中央苏区的红军主力连队之一；在震惊全世界的二万五千里长征中，又曾立过不少的战功。在抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争时期，它曾转战东北、西北、华北、华东、中南、西南诸地区，参加了有名的平型关战役、淮海战役、渡江战役和大西南进军，迭获胜利，用鲜血写下了光辉灿烂的史迹。因此，人们习惯地用“胜利的旗帜”这个光荣的称号来赞誉这个英雄的连队。现在，我把十一连的光辉战绩的片断写在下面。
    竖起胜利的旗帜
    一九三五年冬天，中央红军和陕甘红军会师以后，曾组织了有名的直罗镇（陕西鄜县属）战斗。这次战斗对于粉碎国民党匪军对陕甘革命根据地的围攻，起了重大的作用。在这次战斗中，作为突击队的十一连英勇地突破了敌人的防御阵地，打开了冲锋的道路，使我军得以全部歼灭国民党匪军的一○九师，从而彻底粉碎了敌人的围攻。
    抗日战争开始后，国民党军望风披靡，不战而退；日寇趾高气扬，十分猖獗。一九三七年九月二十三日，日寇大举进攻平型关、雁门关一线，企图直下太原。北上抗日的八路军，就在这时组织了出色的平型关战役。在这个出色的战役中，林彪将军指挥的八路军一一五师包围了日寇精锐主力部队坂垣师团的一个旅团四千多人，消灭了三千多人。严重地打击了日寇的侵略凶焰，鼓舞了全国人民的胜利信心。十一连当时隶属于一一五师，曾和日寇反复冲杀，白刃肉搏、血战竟日，打垮敌人数次反扑，给敌人以重大杀伤。
    转战苏鲁冀豫一带
    在长期的抗日战争中，十一连始终担任着最艰巨的战斗任务。它转战苏鲁冀豫一带，胜利地保卫着人民，打击着日寇和伪军。
    一九三九年八月的“梁山歼灭战”，对于开辟和巩固鲁西抗日根据地起了重要的作用。在这次战斗中，十一连担任突击队。全连首先突破敌人的防线，冲入敌人阵地，和日寇展开白刃战，最后和兄弟连队共同创造了以一个营歼灭日寇一个大队的模范战例，打死、打伤日寇大队长以下四百余名，缴获炮三门及其他军用品一部。
    一九四二年的四月，抗日根据地的军民正在忙着收麦。日军从单县、砀山、虞城向抗日根据地的中心区岳砦发动了合围进攻。某日拂晓，十一连正掩护团直属部队转移，不料在孟楼、岳寨之间的大堤上和日寇遭遇。一场剧烈的反“扫荡”战开始了。虽然英雄们采取了先敌展开、先敌开火的战斗动作，但毕竟因为敌众我寡，而被敌人的五十多辆汽车、一千多的兵力（后来增加到三千多）包围起来。这对十一连是一个严重的考验。但是，十一连的指挥员和战斗员都是以高度的爱国主义思想武装起来的、勇敢而机智的英雄。大家互相嘱咐：“任务重大，情况严重，注意利用地形保存自己，节省弹药；以最大的牺牲决心、机智和勇敢，准备坚持到上级需要我们坚持的时间……”党支部书记站在战斗的最前线，号召共产党员们坚决完成掩护团直属机关的任务。他说：只要有我们十一连的一人一枪，就要保证团首长和直属机关安全转移。勇士们凭借着黄河大堤，和敌人展开了激烈的战斗。负伤的战士都不下火线。模范卫生员李延德，给伤员裹伤时，自己也负了重伤。这时敌人的坦克迎面驶来，他仍努力把战友推出险地。当别的同志发现他的腿已被坦克轧断而去救护他的时候，他仍鼓励自己的战友：“不要管我，加油打吧，多打死几个敌人给我报仇！”
    在漫天的大风沙中，勇士们奋战了八个钟头，一次又一次地打退了日寇的疯狂进攻，迫使伤亡惨重的敌人停止了攻击。英雄们抓住这个有利时机，分两路发起了猛烈的反击。这突然的动作把敌人吓呆了，英雄们胜利地突出重围。
    敌人的“合击扫荡”被粉碎了。十一连以少数的兵力和数千敌人激战整日，以八人的伤亡击毁了敌人汽车两辆，毙伤的鬼子整整装满了三汽车。
    一九四四年秋天，我军为了拯救沦陷区的人民，巩固和扩大抗日根据地，向敌人发起攻势。在魏楼（今山东沛县属）战斗中，十一连又接受了光荣的突击任务。勇士们在数分钟之内就越过三道外壕，拔毁鹿砦，胜利地登上三丈多高的砦墙。但是，我们只有三个勇士占据着突破口，敌人却以整连、整排的兵力进行反扑。情势相当紧急。就在这时，已经负伤的许光福同志，挺身站起，冒着敌人的密集炮火，在十几分钟内，连续掷出近百个手榴弹，最后以白刃肉搏打垮了敌人的数次反扑，巩固了突破口，使后续部队冲进围砦，迅速消灭了敌人。许光福因此被誉为冀鲁豫军区的一等杀敌英雄——钢铁英雄。由于这一次的胜利战斗，不到一月，我军就收复了二百多平方里的土地。
    从胜利走向胜利
    一九四五年秋天，日寇在宣布投降以后，仍对我军进行顽抗。为了解除敌军的武装，冀鲁豫军区部队纷纷出击。在强攻长垣县的战斗中，十一连的勇士们用五分钟的时间突进城内，打垮日、伪军的四次反扑，扩大了突破口，保证了战斗的胜利。在这次战斗中，我军全歼守敌三千余人。
    日寇投降后，在反对国民党匪军进攻解放区的战争中，十一连北出长城，转战冀察绥地区。在张家口保卫战中，十一连坚守在马刨泉高山上，牵制住敌人两个营的兵力；虽然没饭吃，没水喝，仍坚持战斗一整天，并缴获敌人美式山炮两门，迫使进攻之敌，遗弃了不少的尸体和大批军用品仓惶溃退。
    突破长江天险
    一九四九年四月二十一日，人民解放军坚决执行了毛主席和朱总司令的奋勇向前、解放全国的渡江命令，在千余里的战线上，展开了渡江战。
    密集的炮火猛烈地轰击着江南蒋匪军的防线。十一连英雄们的突击船，箭一般地驶向南岸。
    万船疾进。十一连的突击船始终驶在最前面。船过江心，敌人开始了猛烈的射击。十一连的英雄们一面沉着应战，一面加快了行船速度，迅速驶抵南岸。姬凤祥班刚一上岸，便猛扑敌人的地堡，把第一面红旗插上了君山山头。国民党匪军所最后依恃的长江天险，在英雄们的面前，二十五分钟就被突破了。战役结束以后，师党委会把“首面红旗插江南、突破长江天险的英雄连”的光荣称号给予了十一连。
    强攻天险李家砦
    贵州省桐梓、鰼水、仁怀三县的三角地带，有一座高耸入云的山峰，号称“天险李家砦”。山峰上有一个吃人的“封建王国”，沉重地压在贵州东北部人民的头上。蒋匪军“川黔边区反共救国军第五纵队”司令部就依附着这个险砦，统治着周围八十里以内的人民。十一连进军大西南以后，在执行剿匪任务中，又接受了攻击李家砦的突击任务。
    李家砦确是一个不易攻下的险砦。砦内有三百余名土匪固守。砦的东、北两面是高达八百公尺的峭壁，南面、西面都是六七十里路的陡坡。砦上有三道砦墙，四个地堡。
    攻击开始了。十一连的英雄们前仆后继，英勇冲杀，连续夺下两道砦墙，把所有的匪徒压缩在第三道砦墙以内。英雄梁敬喜在突击第二道砦墙时，已负伤两次；但强烈的阶级仇恨支持着他，他带着重伤，突进了第三道砦墙，一面用手榴弹掩护同志们攻击，一面鼓励大家奋勇前进。就在这时，他不幸第三次负重伤，而英勇牺牲了。十一连的勇士们踏着英雄的鲜血，终于把这个压在人民头上几千年的封建堡垒彻底毁灭了。
    十一连虽然对革命事业有着这样卓越的贡献，但他们并没有因此而居功骄傲。在军事练兵和执行其他各项光荣任务中，又继续取得了新的胜利。目前，英雄们正在执行着进一步走向现代化、正规化的新任务，为提高文化和增加科学知识，提高军事技术和战术，保卫祖国，保卫亚洲和世界和平而胜利前进！
