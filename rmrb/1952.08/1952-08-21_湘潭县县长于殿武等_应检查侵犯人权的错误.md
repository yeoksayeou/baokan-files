    Xiangtan County Magistrate Yu Dianwu and Others
    Should Examine Their Mistakes in Violating Human Rights
    To the Editor: Zhao Lin, a civil affairs assistant in the Dongqu People's Government of Changsha County, Hunan Province, took leave in January of this year to return to his hometown of Baishi Township, 13th District, Xiangtan County, to handle divorce procedures. Because he was unable to complete the procedures at that time, Zhao Lin decided to return to his original work unit and deal with the divorce later. When Zhao Lin left, his younger sister saw him off. At the same time, a woman named Fang Juying from Baishi Township wanted to go with them to the Changsha County Trading Company to find her older brother and ask him to introduce her to a job. Because Zhao Lin's younger sister was not going to Changsha County, Fang Juying turned back. During this time, bad elements spread rumors that "Zhao Lin abducted a woman." The Baishi Township People's Government, believing the rumors, sent militiamen to arrest Zhao Lin on the way and send him to the 13th District People's Government. Zuo Yunquan, a member of the Baishi Township work team, even wrote a "certificate" stating that Zhao Lin had abducted a woman. (Editor's note: "Abducting women" is a term used in feudal society to slander love between men and women, and we should not continue to use it. If a woman is deceived and sold for money, vague terms such as "abduction" should not be used either.) On this day, the 13th District People's Government was holding a meeting of township work team leaders, and County Magistrate Yu Dianwu also came to participate. Liu Guiqiu, the public security assistant of the 13th District People's Government, said to Zhao Lin: "You abducted a woman, so we must detain you!" He immediately searched Zhao Lin and discovered that Zhao Lin was a Communist Party member. Liu Guiqiu then said to Zhao Lin: "You are a Party member and you still do this, so we must detain you even more." When County Magistrate Yu Dianwu heard this, he stomped his foot and said loudly: "Damn it! Take off his badge and detain him!" Zhao Lin was detained in the 13th District People's Government for six or seven days before being sent to the Civil Affairs Section of the Xiangtan County People's Government and then to the County People's Court. After the Xiangtan County Democratic Women's Federation learned about this, without conducting an in-depth investigation, it immediately wrote a "bill of indictment" and sent it to the County People's Court. The County People's Court detained Zhao Lin for more than 20 days without taking any action. It was not until the Changsha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent cadres to investigate Zhao Lin's return to his hometown that it was confirmed that the "Zhao Lin abducted a woman" incident was completely fabricated, and Zhao Lin was released.
    We believe that the relevant departments should examine this bureaucratic work style and the behavior that violates human rights.

    湘潭县县长于殿武等
    应检查侵犯人权的错误
    编辑同志：湖南省长沙县东区人民政府民政助理员赵霖，在今年一月间请假回原籍湘潭县十三区白石乡办理离婚手续。因当时没能办理妥当，赵霖便决定仍回原机关工作，离婚的事情以后再说。赵霖走时，他的妹妹给他送行。同时，白石乡一个叫方菊英的妇女，想和他们一起到长沙县贸易公司找自己的哥哥介绍工作。因为赵霖的妹妹不去长沙县，方菊英便转了回去。这当中，坏分子便造谣说：“赵霖拐带妇女。”白石乡人民政府听信了谣言，就派民兵把赵霖由途中抓回来，送交十三区人民政府。白石乡工作组干部左运泉还写了一份赵霖拐带妇女的“证明”。（编者按：拐带妇女是封建社会中侮蔑男女恋爱的用语，我们不应沿用。如果是骗了妇女去卖钱，也不应该用“拐带”之类的含混词句。）这天，十三区人民政府正在开乡工作组长会议，县长于殿武也来参加。十三区人民政府治安助理员刘桂秋对赵霖说：“你拐带妇女，要扣起你！”当即搜查赵霖身上，发见赵霖是共产党员。刘桂秋又对赵霖说：“你是党员还这样，更要扣起你。”县长于殿武听到了，把脚一顿，大声说：“妈的！把他的证章取下，扣起来！”赵霖在十三区人民政府被扣了六、七天后，又被送到湘潭县人民政府民政科转县人民法院。湘潭县民主妇女联合会知道这件事以后，也不深入了解情况，马上就写了“控诉书”送交县人民法院。县人民法院把赵霖扣了二十多天，没作任何处理。直到中共长沙县委员会派干部了解赵霖回乡的情况时，才证实“赵霖拐带妇女”一事完全是捏造的，才把赵霖释放了。
    我们认为，有关部门应该检查这种官僚主义作风和侵犯人权的行为。
