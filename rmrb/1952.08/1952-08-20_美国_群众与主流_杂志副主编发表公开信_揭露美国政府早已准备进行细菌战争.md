    Xinhua News Agency, Prague: The "New York Times" refused to publish a letter from Aptus, deputy editor of the magazine "Masses and Mainstream," to the newspaper. In this letter, Aptus cited an article written two years earlier by Baldwin, a military commentator for the "New York Times," to prove that the U.S. government was already prepared to wage germ warfare before the end of World War II in 1945.
    Aptus's letter was later published in the New York "Daily Worker" on July 31. The letter pointed out: "Baldwin, a military commentator for the 'New York Times,' wrote in the February 1950 issue of 'Atlantic Monthly' (page 38): 'Americans, in their own eyes, are a naive and idealistic nation, and they do not often exhibit the very cruel behavior shown by other nations. But in the eyes of others, our record is not very clean, and objective history cannot conceal this. We rarely advocate limiting terror; we have almost never supported the faint calls for limiting war. We have not ratified the Hague Convention of 1899 on the prohibition of the use of dum-dum bullets in war. We have also never ratified the Geneva Protocol of 1925 on the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons and poison gas...'
    '...We condemn Japan's use of bacteriological weapons against China, but in July and August of 1945, a ship full of American bacteriological weapons to destroy Japanese rice was sailing to the Mariana Islands...'
    '...The dazzling flash over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, was the culmination of the U.S.'s willingness to use any means to achieve its goals. On this day, we joined the ranks of those who use new weapons of terror to exterminate mankind,... We desperately waged total war; we did our best to make the war all-encompassing...'
    Aptus wrote: "The 'New York Times' has tried its best to refute the scientific evidence presented by China regarding the United States' germ warfare in Korea. Is the 'New York Times' now going to deny what its own military editor, Mr. Baldwin, said is true? If not, is it willing to publish this letter to allow readers to study what Mr. Baldwin said?"
    However, the "New York Times" did not dare to publish this letter because it exposed the U.S. government's unscrupulous face in waging war and proved that the germ warfare now being waged by the U.S. against the Korean and Chinese people was a long-planned and long-prepared act.
    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 2nd: TASS reported from Vienna on August 1st that according to the "Austrian People's Voice," after the United States transported tanks, artillery, shells, and explosives to Austria in accordance with its war preparation plan, it began to build warehouses in western Austria to store barbaric weapons - poison gas. One of the warehouses storing mustard gas (a blistering agent, a deadly poison gas) is built in the Lofe Valley in the province of Salzburg. The official name of this warehouse is "Chemical Ordnance Depot." The U.S. military authorities call poison gas "chemical ordnance." The underground warehouses are carefully camouflaged. There are signs in English around the warehouse warning American soldiers not to approach the warehouse. The sign reads: "Blistering Agent, Danger!"
    The "Austrian People's Voice" concluded: The Americans are trying every means to deny the fact that they are using poison gas in Korea. But if they are building poison gas warehouses even in Austria, where no war is taking place, then who will believe the Americans?

### 美国“群众与主流”杂志副主编发表公开信  揭露美国政府早已准备进行细菌战争

    美国“群众与主流”杂志副主编发表公开信
    揭露美国政府早已准备进行细菌战争
    【新华社布拉格讯】“纽约时报”拒绝刊登“群众与主流”杂志的副主编阿普脱克致该报的一封信，阿普脱克在这封信中援引“纽约时报”军事评论员鲍尔温两年前写的文章，证明早在一九四五年第二次世界大战快要结束之前，美国政府就已准备进行细菌战。
    阿普脱克的这封信后来在七月三十一日的纽约“工人日报”上发表了。信中指出：“纽约时报”的军事评论员鲍尔温在一九五零年二月份的“大西洋月刊”（第三十八页）上写道：“美国人在他们自己看起来，是一个天真的理想主义的民族，他们并没有其他民族所时常表现的那种非常残酷的行为。但在别人看来，我们的记录是很不清白的，而客观的历史也不能掩饰这一点。我们很少主张限制恐怖；对于限制战争的微弱的呼声，我们几乎是从来不曾加以声援的。我们并未批准一八九九年关于禁止在战争中使用达姆弹的海牙公约。我们也从未批准一九二五年关于禁止在战争中使用细菌武器和毒气的日内瓦议定书……”
    “……我们谴责日本对中国使用细菌武器，但在一九四五年的七月和八月，一艘满载美国细菌武器用以毁灭日本稻子的轮船却在开往马里亚纳，……”
    “……一九四五年八月六日，广岛上空眩目的一闪，是美国为了达到目的可以不择手段的做法到了登峰造极的地步的表现。在这一天，我们加入了使用新的恐怖武器来灭绝人类的那些人的行列中，……我们拚命地进行总体战争；我们尽了我们最大的力量来使战争无所不包。……”
    阿普脱克写道：“纽约时报费尽心机想驳倒中国提出的关于美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的科学证据。纽约时报现在是不是要否认它自己的军事编辑鲍尔温先生所说的确有其事的话呢？如果不的话，它是不是愿意把这封信登出来让读者们研究鲍尔温先生所说的话？”
    但是，“纽约时报”不敢将这封信登出来，因为这封信揭露了美国政府不择手段进行战争的面目，并证明了美国现在对朝中人民进行的细菌战是策划已久、早已准备进行的。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社维也纳二日讯：八月一日“奥地利人民之声报”的消息说：美国自从依照备战计划，把坦克、大炮、炮弹和炸药运到奥地利来以后，就开始在奥地利西部建筑储存野蛮武器——毒气的仓库。其中有一个储存芥子气（糜烂性毒气，是一种可致人死命的毒气）的仓库，建筑在萨尔斯堡省的洛费尔谷地。这个仓库的正式名称是“化学军需品仓库”。美国军事机关是把毒气称为“化学军需品”的。各地下仓库伪装得都很周密。周围有英文的牌子，警告美国士兵不要走近仓库。牌上写着：“糜烂性毒气，危险！”
    “奥地利人民之声报”在结语里写道：美国人千方百计地想否认他们在朝鲜使用毒气的事实。但是如果说他们甚至在没有发生任何战争的奥地利建造毒气仓库，那末有谁会相信美国的话呢？
