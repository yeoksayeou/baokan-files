    "Painless Childbirth" Will Relieve Women's Suffering During Childbirth
    To the Editor: I am forty-five years old this year. I have given birth to eight children and had one miscarriage. I have suffered greatly during childbirth. Even now, when I hear the words "giving birth," I feel scared. Although my husband is also a doctor, he is helpless with my pain and can only pace outside the delivery room, as anxious as an ant on a hot pan. Therefore, every time I give birth to a daughter, I feel infinite pity for her, thinking that she will also have difficulty escaping this terrible fate in the future. Therefore, I think it is somewhat unfortunate to be born a woman. I never dreamed that there would be a way to relieve women's pain during childbirth.
    Now, the "painless childbirth method" is to be promoted nationwide. In addition to being grateful to the People's Government for its close concern for women, I am even more grateful to the advanced and great Soviet scientists. In order to relieve the personal suffering of women, they have made such outstanding contributions to mankind. This makes me realize even more that only the people's scientists can truly seek happiness for mankind and gain the support and love of the people. Those imperialist accomplices, the "scientists," only know how to study how to control fertility and exterminate races. Therefore, their research can only be rejected and hated by the broad masses of people.

    “无痛分娩法”将解除妇女的产褥痛苦
    编辑同志：我今年四十五岁了，我生过八胎，小产一胎；饱受了产褥的痛苦，至今一提起“生孩子”，我就感觉到害怕。我丈夫虽然也是医生，他对我的痛苦却也无能为力，只能逡巡于产室之外，急得如热锅上的蚂蚁一样。因此，我每生一个女儿，就对她感到无限怜惜，觉得她将来也难挣脱这一可怕的命运。因此，我认为生为妇女真是有些不幸。我从来没有梦想过有什么办法可以解除妇女生产时的痛苦。
    现在，“无痛分娩法”要在全国推行。我除了感激人民政府对妇女的密切关怀之外，更要感激先进的伟大的苏联科学工作者。他们为了解除妇女的切身痛苦，对人类作了如此卓越的供献。这更使我认识到：只有人民的科学工作者才能真正为人类谋幸福，得到人民的拥护和敬爱。而那些帝国主义的帮凶“科学家”们，却只懂得研究怎样节制生育和灭绝人种，因此他们的研究只能遭到广大人民的唾弃和憎恨。
