    Sichuan 301 Factory's Experience in Carrying Out Rationalization Proposals
    Li Ce
    Six months ago, the former director of the state-owned Sichuan 301 Factory, relying on his understanding of production technology, was not receptive to workers' various proposals for reforming production. When a worker suggested using "natural crystallization" for manufacturing potassium chlorate (which has now been successfully tested), his comment was "I'm afraid it's not that simple." Last year, workers submitted a total of 155 rationalization proposals, most of which were not processed, and those that were adopted were not promptly rewarded.
    At the beginning of this year, the new director took office and learned from this lesson, listing the mobilization of workers and technical personnel to make rationalization proposals as an important task in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In the past six months, a total of 162 rationalization proposals have been received, and 79 have been adopted (the rest are still under study), creating wealth worth more than 1.5 billion yuan for the country. The methods adopted by the factory to carry out the rationalization proposal movement are as follows:
    At the beginning of this year's campaign to increase production and practice economy, a rationalization proposal committee was formed by 14 people, including the director, the chairman of the trade union, technical personnel, and veteran workers. Meetings are held every Tuesday and Thursday. At the first meeting, all rationalization proposals are reviewed, and committee members familiar with the content of the proposals are assigned to conduct detailed investigations. They present their opinions on Thursday. If the proposal can be adopted, relevant personnel are entrusted to conduct experiments, summarize the results, and affirm its value. If it involves improving production technology, it is listed as a new operating procedure, universally adopted, and the value of the savings and the award methods are announced in a timely manner. For immature proposals, technical personnel are organized to provide assistance to help them be realized. If a proposal cannot be adopted, the reasons are carefully explained. The Rationalization Proposal Committee also re-examined the suggestions that had been abandoned in the past. This work has powerfully encouraged workers and technical personnel to be bold in their creation and experimentation.
    In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, some production difficulties are encountered from time to time. The leadership, in response to these difficulties, proposes the main topics for carrying out rationalization proposals to the staff and workers, and publicizes them to the entire factory through newsletters and broadcasts, some with rewards offered. For example, all 64 electrolytic cells in the factory are on a single circuit. When one electrolytic cell malfunctions and needs to be repaired, all electrolytic cells must be shut down. The leadership encouraged everyone to find ways to change this situation. Wu Chengji, director of the power plant, proposed "diversion," but the experiment failed. Fan Haowen, a model worker from eastern Sichuan, designed a switch to install on every four electrolytic cells, and the experiment was quite successful. Veteran worker Ge Tianmin, with reference to these two improved methods, further designed a knife switch, so that when one electrolytic cell is broken, only that one is shut down, and the rest can continue to be powered. Each of the above suggestions for improving electrolytic cell switches has been repeatedly discussed by employees, who put forward supplementary and corrective opinions, thereby gradually improving them. Each workshop also adopts the same method, raising the main problems existing in the production of the workshop and calling on everyone to jointly find solutions. The main feature of this method is to give play to the collective wisdom and combine the theory of engineering and technical personnel with the practical experience of the working masses. In this way, not only have production miracles been created, but also the unity of employees has been strengthened.
    At the same time, the Rationalization Proposal Committee also stipulates a kind of initial creation right. That is to say, even if a comrade's proposal is not adopted at all, but because it points out the problems existing in production and thus leads to a solution, the original proposer should also be rewarded. This further increases the confidence of employees in making rationalization proposals, and all unreasonable phenomena in production are exposed and improved at any time; problems that cannot be solved for a while also attract the attention of the leadership.
    Carrying out rationalization proposals is a mass movement, and in-depth mobilization and careful organizational work must be carried out to do a good job. The factory first paid attention to mobilizing Party members and League members to take the lead in making rationalization proposals. In the first half of this year, Party members accounted for only 10 percent of the total number of employees, but they made 15 percent of the total number of rationalization proposals. League members accounted for 10 percent of the total number of employees, and they made 20 percent of the total number of rationalization proposals. Party member Xie Shuming and League member Fu Boqing have made the most rationalization proposals and created the greatest value. Secondly, it is to encourage veteran workers and technical personnel to make rationalization proposals. In the first half of the year, among the 162 rationalization proposals, 103 were made by veteran workers, 44 were made by new workers, and 15 were made by technical personnel. This shows the important role of veteran workers in carrying out rationalization proposals. At the same time, it must be pointed out that although the number of proposals made by technical personnel is small, their savings value is very large, accounting for about one-third of the total value of rationalization proposals. The factory also paid attention to mobilizing technical personnel to help workers revise rationalization proposals. In addition, general administrative and management personnel who make rationalization proposals in terms of production management, work systems, procedures, etc., are appropriately praised or rewarded after adoption. Therefore, new atmospheres have continuously appeared in the accounting, medical, and catering departments.
    The 301 Factory has achieved success in carrying out the rationalization proposal movement and has been praised by the leading organs. On the basis of carrying out rationalization proposals, the factory has promoted various advanced working methods, such as the Kovalev work method, the rapid maintenance method, and the assembly line operation method, which has driven various reforms in production. Conservative ideas have been generally recognized as unacceptable, and the spirit of bold creation and love for the motherland of employees has been fully brought into play.

    四川三零一厂开展合理化建议的经验
    李策
    半年以前，四川省国营三零一厂前任厂长自恃懂得生产技术，不虚心考虑工人对改革生产的各种创议。有一位工人提出制造氯酸钾可以采用“自然结晶”（现已实验成功），他的批语是“怕没有那么简单”。去年工人共提出一百五十五件合理化建议，大部分没有处理，采用的也不及时评奖。
    今年初，新任厂长到职，接受了这个教训，将发动工人、技术人员提合理化建议列为开展增产节约运动的重要课题。半年以来，共收到合理化建议一百六十二件，采用七十九件（其余正继续研究中），给国家创造了价值十五亿元以上的财富。该厂开展合理化建议运动所采用的办法如下：
    今年初增产节约运动开始，由厂长、工会主席、技术人员和老工人等十四人组成合理化建议委员会。每星期二、四开会一次，第一次会议上审查各项合理化建议，并责成熟习建议内容的委员进行详细调查，在星期四提出意见，可以采用的，就委托有关人员予以试验、总结、肯定下来。属于改进生产技术的，则列为新的操作规程，普遍采用，并及时公布节约价值及给奖办法。对于不成熟的建议，则组织技术人员给予帮助促其实现。不能采用的，也慎重说明原因。合理化建议委员会并重新审查了从前被遗弃的建议。这些工作，有力地鼓舞了工人、技术人员大胆创造、大胆尝试的热情。
    增产节约运动中，随时会碰到一些生产上的困难，领导方面针对这些困难，向职工提出开展合理化建议的主要课题，利用快报、广播向全厂公布，有的并提出悬赏。例如该厂六十四只电解槽，全是一条电路，一只电解槽发生故障，须要检修时，全部电解槽都要停电。领导方面即鼓励大家想法改变这种状况。动力所吴承基所长，提出“分流”，实验失败。川东劳动模范范浩文设计四个电解槽安装一个开关，实验后相当成功。老工人葛天民参照这两次改进的办法，进一步设计了闸刀开关，使坏一只电槽时只停一只，其余的照常供电。以上每项改进电解槽开关的建议，均经职工反复讨论，提出补充修正意见，因而逐次提高。各个车间也采取同样办法，提出本车间生产中存在的主要问题，号召大家共同想办法解决。此种方法的主要特点，是发挥集体的智慧，并使工程技术人员的理论与工人群众的实际经验相结合。这样，不仅创造了生产中的奇迹，也加强了职工的团结。
    同时，合理化建议委员会还规定了一种初创权。就是说，即使一位同志提出的建议，根本没有采用，但是由于指出了生产中存在的问题，从而得到解决，原提建议的人，也应该受到奖励。这更增加了职工提合理化建议的信心，生产中一切不合理的现象，随时都被揭发出来，得到改进；一时不能解决的，也引起领导方面的注意。
    开展合理化建议是一个群众性的运动，必须进行深入的动员和周密的组织工作，才能作好。该厂首先注意了发动党团员带头提出合理化建议。今年上半年，党员仅占职工总数的百分之十，提出的合理化建议占总数的百分之十五。团员占职工总数的百分之十，提出的合理化建议占总数的百分之二十。党员谢树明、团员傅伯卿都是提的合理化建议最多、创造价值较大的。其次，是鼓励老工人、技术人员提合理化建议。上半年一百六十二件合理化建议中，老工人提的有一百零三件，新工人提的有四十四件，技术人员提的有十五件。这说明老工人对开展合理化建议的重要作用。同时也须要指明，技术人员提的件数虽少，但其节约价值很大，约占合理化建议总值的三分之一。该厂并注意发动技术人员帮助工人修正合理化建议。此外，对一般行政管理人员在生产管理、工作制度、手续等方面提出合理化建议的，经采用后，也适当地给以表扬或奖励。因此，在会计、医务、伙食各部门，都不断地出现了新的气象。
    三零一厂开展合理化建议运动是有成绩的，已受到领导机关的表扬。在开展合理化建议的基础上，该厂推广了各种先进工作法，如郭瓦廖夫工作法、快速检修法、流水作业法，带动了生产上的各项改革。保守思想已公认是要不得的，职工们大胆创造和热爱祖国的精神，获得了充分的发挥。
