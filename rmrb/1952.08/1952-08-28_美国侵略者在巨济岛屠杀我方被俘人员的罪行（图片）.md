    The American aggressors have continuously massacred our captured personnel in Geoje Island and other prisoner-of-war camps. A bloody massacre was carried out on Geoje Island on the morning of June 10th, resulting in over 160 casualties among our captured personnel. The following two pictures were originally published in the "International Cultural Pictorial" published in Tokyo, Japan.
