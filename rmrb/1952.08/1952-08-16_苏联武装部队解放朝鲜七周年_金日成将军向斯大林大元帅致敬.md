Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 15th: TASS Moscow, August 15th: Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a telegram to Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. The telegram reads as follows: To Comrade Marshal Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Moscow Kremlin:

    On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the liberation of Korea from the yoke of Japanese imperialism by the powerful armed forces of the great Soviet Union, on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people, and in a personal capacity, I extend to you, the dear friend and liberator of the Korean people, the deep gratitude of the Korean people, and please convey this sentiment to the Soviet government, the Soviet army, and the entire Soviet people.

    Since the day Korea was liberated, the Soviet government has been promoting the establishment of a truly independent and people's democratic Korean state by various means and has been and continues to help Korea's economic and cultural development.

    Inspired by the great example of the Soviet Union, the Korean people resolutely began to engage in the construction of people's democracy. The warm support and multifaceted assistance of the Soviet Union have inspired the Korean people to move towards final victory in the struggle for freedom, independence, and peace, against the instigators of a new war—the American imperialists.

    The American imperialists have launched a bloody intervention in Korea. They have committed and continue to commit indescribable crimes against the Korean people. However, historical experience and the great victories achieved by the Korean people in the Korean War show that neither germ warfare nor other brutal crimes can destroy the will of the heroic Korean people who have risen up to wage a just war.

    We are fully determined to defend our freedom and independence in the struggle against the American and British interventionist forces, thereby contributing to the cause of peace. We will unswervingly and unyieldingly move forward along the path pointed out to the working people of the world by you, our beloved teacher; we will advance together with the entire democratic camp of freedom-loving people led by the great Soviet Union.

    From the bottom of my heart, I wish you, Comrade Chairman, good health and longevity, for the benefit of all progressive humanity.

    Kim Il-sung
    Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

    苏联武装部队解放朝鲜七周年
    金日成将军向斯大林大元帅致敬
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成致电苏联部长会议主席斯大林。电文如下：莫斯科克里姆林宫苏联部长会议主席约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林大元帅主席同志：
    值此伟大苏联的强大武装部队从日本帝国主义枷锁下解放朝鲜七周年之际，我谨代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体人民并以我个人的名义，向您，朝鲜人民的挚友和解放者，表示朝鲜人民深切感激之情，并请您把这个情意转达给苏联政府、苏联军队和全体苏联人民。
    从朝鲜得到解放的那一天起，苏联政府一直在用各种方法促进一个真正独立的人民民主的朝鲜国家的建立，曾经而且仍在继续帮助朝鲜的经济和文化发展。
    朝鲜人民在苏联的伟大榜样的鼓舞下，坚决地开始从事人民民主的建设。苏联的热烈支持和多方面的援助，鼓舞着朝鲜人民在争取自由、独立与和平、反对新战争煽动者——美帝国主义者的战斗中走向最后胜利。
    美帝国主义者已在朝鲜发动了血腥的干涉。他们曾经而且仍在继续对朝鲜人民干出难以形容的罪行。可是，历史经验和朝鲜人民在朝鲜战争过程中取得的巨大胜利表明：不论是细菌武器或者其他残暴的罪行，都不能摧毁英勇奋起进行正义战争的朝鲜人民的意志。
    我们有充分的决心，在反对美英干涉军的斗争中保卫我们的自由和独立，从而对和平事业有所贡献。我们要坚定不移地、百折不回地沿着您，我们敬爱的导师，给世界劳动人民指出的道路，向前迈进；我们要与伟大的苏联领导的整个爱好自由的人民的民主阵营踏着同一的步伐，一起前进。
    我从内心的深处祝您，主席同志，身体健康，万寿无疆，以造福全体进步人类。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相  金日成
