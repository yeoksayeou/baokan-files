    Nationwide Dockworkers Urgently Demand:
    Eradicate Poisoning Accidents from Handling Dangerous Goods

    Editor's Note: We have received letters from dockworkers and trade union workers from various regions, as well as other readers, requesting that relevant authorities promptly take effective measures to prevent poisoning accidents among dockworkers handling dangerous goods. We contacted the China Dockworkers' Union, who believe this is a problem that urgently needs to be resolved by the vast number of dockworkers across the country. The China Dockworkers' Union Correspondence Group has also written to us about their understanding of the situation and their suggestions for resolving this issue. In order to draw the attention of relevant authorities and facilitate an early resolution to this problem, we are publishing the letter from the China Dockworkers' Union Correspondence Group below.

    Comrade Editor: The hope that relevant authorities will promptly take effective measures to prevent poisoning accidents among dockworkers handling dangerous goods is indeed an urgent demand of the vast number of dockworkers across the country.

    To address this issue, the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government issued "Several Measures Concerning the Handling of Dangerous Goods" last October. However, some units have not paid enough attention to this issue, leading to continued incidents of worker poisoning. According to statistics, from January to July of this year, a total of seventeen worker poisoning accidents occurred in twelve locations, including Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuxi, Zhengzhou, Chongqing, Qiqihar, Harbin, Andong, Tianjin, Tonghua, and Teng County, resulting in 548 poisoned workers. Among these, asphalt poisoning accidents accounted for fourteen incidents, with 524 poisoned workers. This situation not only seriously endangers the lives and safety of dockworkers, causing widespread anxiety among them, but also harms the country's economic construction.

    Why do these heartbreaking events occur? First, the heads of shipping enterprises, warehouse keepers, vehicle escorts, and others are guilty of dereliction of duty, or even resort to deceptive means, disregarding the lives of workers by allowing them to handle toxic substances as if they were ordinary goods. This was the case in eight of the fourteen asphalt poisoning accidents this year. For example, Wu Baocheng, a dockworker from Wuzui in Tianjin County, noticed that the asphalt packaging he was handling was broken and powder was flying around. He raised this issue with Yao Bingquan, the vehicle escort, who replied: "If there is any danger, we will be responsible." He deceived the workers into handling the goods, resulting in the poisoning of eighteen workers. Another example is Sui Xinquan, a dispatcher from the Sixth Construction Section of a certain unit in Beijing, who used deceptive means on July 16th and 17th, resulting in the poisoning of thirteen carters (this incident has not yet been addressed).

    Second, inadequate packaging of dangerous goods is also an important cause of worker poisoning accidents. Currently, the asphalt being handled in various regions is packaged in straw bags. After being stored for a long time, the straw bags rot. If the weather is dry during handling, the asphalt powder will fly around, easily adhering to the workers' skin and being inhaled into their lungs. If the weather is humid, the asphalt easily dissolves and solidifies, making handling time-consuming and laborious, and increasing the risk of poisoning. On March 28th this year, the Chongqing Dockworkers' Company, due to worker poisoning, immediately suggested to relevant authorities in the Southwest that asphalt packaging be changed to wooden or iron barrels. However, this issue has not yet been resolved.

    In order to completely eradicate the occurrence of such unfortunate events, in addition to dockworkers' companies and trade union organizations vigorously strengthening worker safety education and on-site inspection work, we suggest:

    1. All units consigning dangerous goods must strictly abide by the regulations of the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government, and notify the dockworkers' company in writing of the name, nature, quantity, and packaging of the goods in advance. Responsible personnel of the dockworkers' company must inform the workers before handling. If the consigning unit or dockworkers' company engages in deceptive behavior towards workers again, the local people's government should impose severe penalties on the relevant personnel.

    2. We hope that relevant authorities, such as the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government, will conduct research on the properties of dangerous goods (especially easily toxic substances such as asphalt) and methods for preventing poisoning, and stipulate packaging markings and handling procedures for such goods.

    3. The suggestion from the Chongqing Dockworkers' Company to switch to iron or wooden barrels for asphalt packaging is one of the fundamental ways to solve the problem. We hope that the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Labor will pay attention to and promptly study this suggestion.

    This is the unanimous demand of the vast number of dockworkers across the country, and it is also an important task related to national economic construction that urgently needs to be resolved. We hope you will publish this letter in the newspaper so that this issue can be resolved more quickly.

### 全国广大搬运工人迫切要求  根绝搬运危险性物品中毒事故

    全国广大搬运工人迫切要求
    根绝搬运危险性物品中毒事故
    编者按：我们收到各地搬运工人和工会工作者以及其他读者的来信，要求各有关机关迅速采取有效办法防止搬运工人搬运危险性物品中毒事故的发生。我们曾和中国搬运工会联系。他们认为这是一个全国广大搬运工人迫切要求解决的问题。中国搬运工会通讯组并把他们所了解的情况和对解决这个问题的建议写给我们。为了引起各有关机关的重视，以便早日解决这个问题，今将中国搬运工会通讯组的来信发表于后。
    编辑同志：希望各有关机关迅速采取有效办法，防止搬运工人搬运危险性物品中毒事故的发生，的确是全国广大搬运工人的一个迫切要求。
    为了解决这个问题，去年十月中央人民政府劳动部曾颁布了“关于搬运危险性物品的几项办法”。但是，有些单位仍未重视这个问题，以致工人中毒事件继续发生。据统计，今年一月到七月，在北京、上海、南京、无锡、郑州、重庆、齐齐哈尔、哈尔滨、安东市及天津、通化、滕县十二个地方共发生工人中毒事故十七次，中毒工人五百四十八人。其中搬运沥青中毒事故占十四次，中毒工人五百二十四人。这个情况，不但使搬运工人的生命安全遭受严重危害，引起广大搬运工人的不安；而且也危害了国家的经济建设。
    为什么会发生这种痛心的事件呢？第一，是托运企业部门负责人、仓库保管员、车辆押运员等渎职失职，甚至采取欺骗手段，玩忽工人生命，让工人把有毒物品当作一般物品搬运。今年十四次沥青中毒事故中，这种情况就有八次。如天津县吴咀搬运工人吴宝成发现搬运的沥青包装破裂、粉末飞扬，向车辆押运员姚秉全提出意见。姚秉全却说：“发生危险，由我们负责。”欺骗工人搬运。结果造成了十八名工人中毒的事件。又如北京某单位第六施工所调配员隋鑫泉等在七月十六、十七日连续使用欺骗手段，造成了十三名赶车工人中毒事件（这一事件至今尚未处理）。
    第二，危险性物品包装不严，也是造成工人中毒事故的重要原因。现在各地搬运的沥青，都是草袋包装。堆放日久，草袋就糜烂了。如果搬运时气候干燥，沥青粉末飞扬，容易附着工人皮肤及吸入肺部；如果气候潮湿，沥青又易溶化凝固，搬运时费时费力，并会感染中毒。今年三月二十八日，重庆市搬运公司因工人中毒，当即向西南有关机关建议将沥青改用木桶、铁桶包装。但这个问题至今还未解决。
    为了彻底根绝这种不幸事件的发生，除了各地搬运公司及工会组织应该大力加强工人的安全教育和现场检查工作外，我们建议：
    一、一切托运危险性物品的单位，必须严格遵守中央人民政府劳动部的规定，事前将物品名称、性质、数量及包装情况书面通知搬运公司。搬运公司负责人员，必须在搬运前告诉工人。如果托运单位或搬运公司再有欺骗工人的行为，当地人民政府等应该给有关人员以严厉的处分。
    二、希望中央人民政府重工业部、卫生部、劳动部等有关机关对危险性物品（尤其是沥青等易中毒物品）的性能及预防中毒办法进行研究，并规定这类物品的包装标志和搬运接交办法。
    三、重庆市搬运公司关于改用铁桶或木桶包装沥青的建议，是解决问题的根本方法之一。希望重工业部及劳动部重视并迅速研究这个建议。
    这是全国广大搬运工人一致的要求，也是有关国家经济建设的一项急待解决的重要工作，希望你们把这封信在报上发表，以便使这个问题能更迅速地解决。中国搬运工会通讯组
