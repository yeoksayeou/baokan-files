    The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's directive on strengthening the people's supervision correspondents and the people's complaint reception rooms is an important measure to closely link the people's government with the masses, consolidate the victorious achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, eradicate corruption, theft, and other "three evils" and "five poisons," and ensure the smooth progress of our country's large-scale construction work. People's governments and people's supervisory organs at all levels should earnestly implement it.

    In the great anti-corruption and anti-theft movement, the people's supervision correspondents and the people's complaint reception rooms played an extremely important role. The people's supervision correspondents of the central government's directly affiliated organs and various provinces and cities have exposed many huge cases of corruption and theft, and have exposed the problems of certain responsible cadres of organs who were unwilling to take the lead in self-criticism, who were weak in leading the movement, or who were themselves not clean, through various means such as their own reporting, mobilizing others to report, and setting up suggestion boxes and anonymous complaint boxes. Timely resolution of these problems effectively promoted the development of the movement. The people's complaint reception rooms attracted a large number of people who could not or were unwilling to write letters to make oral complaints and reports, and provided a large number of materials and clues for various cases. Facts show that the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns nationwide was inseparable from the activities of the people's supervision correspondents and the people's complaint reception rooms in various organs. Not only that, but they also exposed illegal and undisciplined behaviors and bad work styles of state organ staff and certain important leading cadres in other aspects, making the movement develop into a great democratic construction movement that comprehensively solved the relationship between the Party and the masses, the relationship between the People's Government and the people, and the relationship between leaders and the led.

    But on the other hand, facts also prove that the work of the existing people's supervision correspondents and the people's complaint reception rooms is still far from meeting the actual needs. Leading organs below the special district level, which have more contact with the broad masses, have basically not yet been established; although leading organs at the provincial (municipal) level and above and the major departments of the central government have been established, they have not yet been universally established in the numerous directly affiliated organs. Some units with five or six thousand people have only two or three people's supervision correspondents, which is obviously not enough. Some of those that have been set up are also formalistic and do not play a major role. The difficulties that Zhang Shunyou encountered in the three provinces of Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Chahar when reporting counter-revolutionary elements are clear evidence.

    Why are many of the people's supervision correspondents and the people's complaint reception rooms that have been established not functioning effectively? The main reason is that some leading cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of this work and therefore do not pay enough attention to it. They do not help or check the work of the people's supervision correspondents and the people's complaint reception rooms, but let them drift along; they do not make the people's supervision correspondents public to the masses so that they can connect with the masses; nor do they give the people's supervision correspondents activity time and other necessary considerations. Some organs also delay handling and responding to complaint materials. Especially serious is that some leading cadres actually use their positions and powers to illegally withhold letters of complaint from the people's supervision correspondents and the masses that involve certain mistakes of their own, and do not allow them to be reported to higher levels; they even carry out overt or covert attacks and retaliation against the complainants. This situation makes the work of the people's supervision correspondents and the cadres of the people's complaint reception rooms encounter many difficulties, their enthusiasm for work is affected, mass complaints are restricted, and serious violations of discipline and bureaucracy such as those of Wang Gaosheng, the former president of the Wen County People's Court, cannot be overcome in a timely manner. Therefore, when implementing this directive of the Government Administration Council, in addition to universally developing people's supervision correspondents and establishing people's complaint reception rooms in accordance with the provisions of the directive, we must also take effective steps to overcome the existing bad phenomena. When implementing this directive of the Government Administration Council, local leading organs and leading cadres should, in accordance with the notice issued today by the Central People's Supervision Committee, earnestly study the lessons of the Zhang Shunyou incident, and earnestly check the work of receiving the people and handling the people's complaints, and check bureaucratic work styles. The provinces of North China, through the handling of the Zhang Shunyou incident and the associated check on bureaucracy, have alerted many leading cadres and effectively improved the work of receiving the people and handling the people's letters. This experience is worth promoting.

    In order to establish a closer connection between the work of the people's supervision correspondents and the broad masses, we should also resolutely implement the provision in the Government Administration Council's directive that the people's supervision correspondents should be democratically elected by the masses. This not only makes it easier for the people's supervision correspondents to collect the opinions of the masses, obtain the support of the masses, and inspire the masses' sense of ownership, but also strengthens the people's supervision correspondents' sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for work. Some organs have done this in the past, and the results have been very good and the effect has been great. The staffing of the people's complaint reception rooms must also be in accordance with the Government Administration Council's directive, selecting personnel "with a strong mass viewpoint, a certain level of policy, a serious and responsible attitude towards work, and enthusiasm and sincerity towards the masses"; personnel who are not enthusiastic about the masses and have little understanding of policies cannot be in charge of this work. Of course, we must also formulate some practical and feasible working systems, such as handling methods for various types of complaints and applications, strict reporting system in the work, inspection and summary system, division of labor responsibility system, and so on. Without these, it is not easy to do this work well by relying solely on the enthusiasm of the cadres.

    Those cadres of the people's complaint reception rooms who have achieved excellent work results in the past, and the people's supervision correspondents who have exposed major cases and provided valuable suggestions, should be rewarded and commended to set an example and call on cadres and the masses to learn from them. Those cadres of the people's complaint reception rooms and the people's supervision correspondents who are irresponsible in their work and have made mistakes should be criticized, disciplined, and even dismissed from their posts.

    When implementing this directive, all localities should not only educate the cadres who are directly engaged in this work on mass viewpoints and policies so that they have full confidence and determination to do this work well; at the same time, they should use various opportunities, use cadre meetings and mass meetings to publicize to the general cadres and the broad masses, and show the firm support of the leading organs for this work, and call on everyone to fearlessly expose and report all illegal and undisciplined behaviors and bad work styles to the people's supervision correspondents and the people's complaint reception rooms, so that state organs and their staff are constantly supervised by the people.

### 认真加强人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的工作

    认真加强人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的工作
    中央人民政府政务院关于加强人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的指示，是密切人民政府与人民群众联系、巩固“三反”“五反”胜利成果、根绝贪污盗窃等“三害”“五毒”、使我们国家的大规模建设工作能够顺利进行的重要措施。各级人民政府和人民监察机关应该认真执行。
    在伟大的反贪污、反盗窃运动中，人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室曾经起过极其重大的作用。中央直属机关及各省市的人民监察通讯员，曾经以自己检举、发动别人检举、设立意见箱、密告箱等各种方式，揭发过许多巨大的贪污盗窃案件，揭发过某些机关负责干部不肯带头检讨、对运动领导不力或自己手面不干净的问题，使这些问题得到及时的解决，有力地推动了运动的开展。人民检举接待室则吸引了大量不能写信或不愿写信的人进行口头的检举揭发，大量提供了各种案件的材料和线索。事实说明，“三反”“五反”运动所以能够迅速取得全国范围的伟大胜利，是和各机关人民监察通讯员及人民检举接待室的活动分不开的。不仅如此，他们还揭发了国家机关工作人员和若干重要领导干部在其他方面的违法乱纪行为和不良作风，使运动发展成为全面解决党与群众关系、人民政府与人民群众关系、领导与被领导关系的伟大民主建设运动。
    但在另一方面，事实又证明，现有的人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的工作，和实际的需要相比还是距离很远的。专区以下与广大群众接触较多的领导机关，基本上还没有建立；省（市）级以上领导机关及中央各大部门虽然已经建立，但在众多的直属机关中也还没有普遍建立。有的五、六千人的单位只有两三个人民监察通讯员，这是显然不够的。已经设立起来的，也还有一些是形式主义、不大起作用的。张顺有检举反革命分子时在绥远、山西、察哈尔三省所遇到的阻难，就是明证。
    已建立的人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室为什么会有许多不起作用的呢？主要的原因，是有些领导干部对这一工作的重大意义认识不足，因而不予重视。他们对人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室的工作不加以帮助和检查，而听其自流；不把人民监察通讯员向群众公开，使他们联系群众；也不给人民监察通讯员以活动时间和其他必要的照顾。对于检举材料，有的机关也拖延不办，不予答复。尤其严重的，是有的领导干部竟利用职权地位，把人民监察通讯员和群众的检举信件中涉及自己某些错误的非法扣留下来，不许上达；甚至对检举人实行明的或暗的打击与报复。这种情形，使人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室干部的工作发生许多困难，工作积极性受到影响，使群众性的检举受到限制，使前温县人民法院院长王高升之类的严重违法乱纪行为和官僚主义作风不能及时克服。因此，在执行政务院这个指示的时候，我们除了应该依照指示中的规定普遍发展人民监察通讯员和建立人民检举接待室以外，还必须采取有效步骤克服现存的不良现象。各地领导机关和领导干部在执行政务院这一指示时，应按照中央人民监察委员会今天发布的通知，认真研究张顺有事件的教训，并认真检查接见人民群众和处理人民控告的工作，检查官僚主义作风。华北各省经过张顺有事件的处理和联系检查官僚主义，警醒了许多领导干部，有效地改善了接见人民群众和处理人民来信的工作，这一经验值得推广。
    为了使人民监察通讯员的工作和广大群众建立更密切的联系，我们还应该坚决执行政务院指示中由群众民主推选人民监察通讯员的规定。这样做不但便于人民监察通讯员搜集群众意见，取得群众的支持，启发群众主人翁的自觉，而且可以加强人民监察通讯员的工作责任心和积极性。过去有些机关这样做了，结果很好，作用很大。人民检举接待室的干部的配备，也必须遵照政务院指示，选择“有坚强的群众观点，有一定的政策水平，对工作认真负责，对群众热情诚恳”的人员；对群众毫无热情、对政策很少了解的人员，是不能担任这项工作的。当然，我们还必须制定一些切实可行的工作制度，如对各类检举和申请的处理办法、工作中严格的请示报告制度、检查总结制度、分工负责制度等等。没有这些，单凭干部的热情也是不容易做好这个工作的。
    对于过去工作成绩优异的人民检举接待室干部、检举揭发了重大案件和提供了有价值的建议的人民监察通讯员，应该给予奖励和表扬，树立榜样，号召干部与群众向他们学习。对于工作不负责任和犯有错误的人民检举接待室干部和人民监察通讯员，应该进行批评、处分以至撤销职务。
    各地在执行这一指示的时候，不仅应该对直接担任这项工作的干部进行关于群众观点和政策的教育，使他们有充分的信心和决心做好这一工作；同时应该利用各种机会，利用干部会议和群众会议，对一般干部和广大群众进行宣传，并表明领导机关对这一工作的坚决支持，号召大家无顾虑地向人民监察通讯员和人民检举接待室揭发与检举一切违法乱纪行为和恶劣作风，使国家机关及其工作人员经常受到人民群众的监督。
