The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions convened a cadre meeting on July 20th, introducing a factory's experience in promoting advanced techniques.

Under the leadership of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Northeast People's Government, the work of promoting advanced experiences in factories and mines throughout Northeast China has been successful. Many important advanced experiences, such as high-speed cutting methods, multi-tool multi-edge cutting methods, the Hao Jianxiu work method, and the 1951 weaving method, have been preliminarily promoted. However, there are still many problems in the promotion of advanced experiences. For example, some units are still limited to general appeals and lack the leadership, organization, and purpose in their promotion; some units are satisfied with formalistic approaches and do not pay attention to the actual effect of the promotion; and some units even adopt hasty and crude methods to force workers to learn. Among the workers, phenomena such as outwardly learning but inwardly not learning, learning sometimes and not learning other times, or learning this and forgetting that, also occur.

In the increased production and economy campaign this year, a factory in Shenyang, under the unified leadership of the Party committee and with the joint efforts of the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, created a relatively successful experience in promoting advanced experiences (see page 2 of the People's Daily, July 14th). In order to promote this experience and solve the problems existing in the current promotion of advanced experiences, the Standing Committee of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions decided to convene a cadre meeting of the provinces, cities, and industrial trade unions. Comrade Qi Tinghan, chairman of the factory's trade union, vividly introduced their experience. The main contents of this experience are: First, it is necessary to break the conservative, complacent, and trouble-averse thinking of cadres, so that the entire factory, from the factory director to the group leaders, recognizes that promoting advanced experiences is the basic way to ensure the realization of advanced increased production and economy plans. Second, mobilize and educate workers to consciously learn advanced experiences. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to investigate what ideological concerns prevent workers from wanting to learn advanced experiences; summarize the ideological situation and operating techniques of advanced workers in creating advanced experiences, and let them report to everyone; mobilize everyone to generally examine their own thinking and dig out the roots of unwillingness to learn advanced experiences. Third, use the Kovalev work method to summarize the advanced experiences and tips of a group or a workshop into technical operating procedures, and mobilize everyone to learn technology, improve technology, and master advanced technical operating procedures. Fourth, provide timely rewards and conduct publicity work. Comrade Qi Tinghan's report was detailed and specific, and was warmly welcomed by everyone, who believed that the factory's work in promoting advanced production experience was thorough and meticulous, and was truly worthy of learning.

    东北总工会召开干部大会
    介绍某工厂推广先进经验的经验
    东北总工会于七月二十日召开各省市，各产业工会干部大会，介绍某厂推广先进经验的经验。
    在中共中央东北局及东北人民政府的领导下，东北各地厂矿推广先进经验工作是有成绩的。许多重要的先进经验，如高速切削法、多刀多刃切削法、郝建秀工作法与一九五一织布法等都已初步推广。但是，在推广先进经验中，还存在很多问题，如有些单位还只限于一般号召，缺乏有领导、有组织、有目的地推广；有些单位满足于形式主义的一套作法，不注意推广的实际效果；甚至有的单位采取急躁粗暴的方法，强制工人学习。而在工人群众中，也产生明学暗不学，时学时不学或学了这个丢了那个的现象。
    沈阳某工厂在今年增产节约运动中，在党委统一领导下，经过行政、工会、青年团共同努力，创造了比较成功的推广先进经验的经验（见人民日报七月十四日第二版）。为了将这经验加以推广，解决目前推广先进经验中存在的问题，东北总工会常务委员会决定召开各省市各产业工会干部大会，由某工厂工会主席齐廷汉同志生动地介绍了他们的经验。这经验的主要内容：一、要打破干部的保守、自满、嫌麻烦思想，使全厂从厂长到小组长等，都认识到推广先进经验，是保证实现先进增产节约计划的基本办法。二、发动教育职工，做到使全体职工自觉地学习先进经验。要达到这目的，就要调查有那些思想顾虑使工人不愿学习先进经验；总结先进工人创造先进经验的思想情况和操作技术，让他们向大家作报告；发动大家普遍检查自己思想，挖出不愿学习先进经验的根源。三、用郭瓦廖夫工作方法，把一个组、一个车间的先进经验和窍门，总结成技术操作规程，发动大家学习技术，提高技术，掌握先进的技术操作规程。四、及时奖励，进行宣传工作。齐廷汉同志报告得又详细又具体，受到大家热烈欢迎，认为某厂推广先进生产经验的工作，做得又深入又细致，真是值得学习。
