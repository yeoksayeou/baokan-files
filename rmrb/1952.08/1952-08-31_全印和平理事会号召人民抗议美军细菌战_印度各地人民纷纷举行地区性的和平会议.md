    Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: New Delhi delayed news: The Standing Committee of the All India Peace Council, at its meeting held from June 13th to 16th, passed a "Resolution on Germ Warfare." It condemned US imperialism for conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China and called on the people of India to rise up and protest against this crime of the US military.
    The resolution said: The members of the Standing Committee have made a very careful study of the evidence presented by impartial observers from many countries (including India) regarding the accusations of germ warfare in Korea and China. After studying these materials, we are deeply convinced without any doubt that the United States military has been using this inhuman and appalling means of mass extermination of human beings, spreading infectious disease bacteria on a large scale. This crime is being committed in the name of the United Nations, which is a great shame. We consider germ warfare to be a crime against human conscience and civilization, a threat to the arduous achievements of mankind's labor and talent in the struggle between life and death, and the people of India and their peace-loving ancient civilization and traditions can play an important role in the struggle to stop this means of war.
    The resolution concluded: "We appeal to all the people of India to understand this evidence, to unite in the millions to protest against this germ warfare, and to demand punishment for all the criminals who have committed this crime."
    Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: TASS, Delhi, August 27th: Preparations for convening the Third All India Peace Congress and participating in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference are being widely carried out in India. The recently held Patiala and East Punjab States Union Peace Conference called for a ban on foreigners recruiting Gurkha soldiers in India and for taking necessary measures to restore peace in Korea.
    Peace advocates in Bihar Province held a meeting in Gaya City. Dr. Kitchlew, Chairman of the All India Peace Council, pointed out the anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda conducted by American newspapers in India. He said: The achievements made by China in the past three years irrefutably prove that the Chinese people are vigorously engaged in national construction. Kitchlew said that the situation in the Soviet Union is also the same.
    The North Province Peace Conference, which has already closed, passed a resolution requesting the government to "implement a policy to prevent the expansion of war, and to implement a policy to ensure the realization of the right to national self-determination for the people of all countries who have become victims of imperialist aggression." The conference assured the Korean people that the Indian people will demand that their government not support the actions of the so-called "United Nations forces" in Korea, because they are using napalm bombs to bomb civilians and are barbarously persecuting prisoners of war. The conference expressed its solidarity with the Japanese people who firmly protested against the separate "peace treaty."

    全印和平理事会号召人民抗议美军细菌战
    印度各地人民纷纷举行地区性的和平会议
    【新华社三十日讯】新德里迟到消息：全印和平理事会常务委员会在六月十三日至十六日举行的会议中，曾通过了“关于细菌战的决议”。斥责美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战，并号召印度全国人民起来抗议美军的这种罪行。
    决议说：常务委员会的委员们对于许多国家（包括印度）的公正观察家所提出的关于在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的控责的证据，做了极细心的研究。我们研究了这些材料后，毫无怀疑地深信，美国军队已在使用这种不人道的骇人听闻的大规模灭绝人类的手段，大规模地撒播了传染病细菌。这种罪行以联合国的名义干出来，是一个奇耻大辱。我们认为细菌战是一种违反人类良心和文明的罪行，是对人类用勤劳和天赋在生与死的斗争中所获得的艰巨成就的一种威胁，印度人民和他们的爱好和平的古代文明和传统，在制止这种战争手段的斗争中，可以起着重要的作用。
    决议最后说：“我们吁请全体印度人民，都来了解这些证据，千千万万人联合起来，对这种细菌战提出抗议，并要求惩罚所有犯下这种罪行的罪犯。”
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社德里二十七日讯：印度广泛地展开了召开第三届全印和平大会和参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备工作。最近召开的巴地阿拉与东旁遮普士邦联盟和平会议，要求禁止外国在印度境内招募廓尔喀兵，并采取恢复朝鲜和平的必要措施。
    比哈尔省的和平拥护者曾在加雅城举行会议。全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士指出了在印度的美国报纸进行反苏、反共宣传。他说：中国在最近三年中获得的成绩无可辩驳地证明了中国人民正在大力进行国家建设。克其鲁说，苏联的情形也是这样。
    业已闭幕的北方省和平会议通过了一项决议，要求政府“执行防止战争扩大的政策，执行保证使成为帝国主义侵略牺牲品的各国人民实现民族自决权原则的政策。”会议向朝鲜人民保证：印度人民必将要求本国政府不支持所谓“联合国军”在朝鲜的行动，因为他们在使用凝固汽油弹轰炸平民，并对战俘进行野蛮的迫害。会议对坚决抗议单独“和约”的日本人民，表示声援。
