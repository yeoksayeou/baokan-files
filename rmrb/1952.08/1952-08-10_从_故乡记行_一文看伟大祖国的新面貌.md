    A View of the New Look of the Great Motherland from "A Trip to My Hometown"

    Editor: The article "A Trip to My Hometown" written by Hua Chen, an air force soldier of the People's Liberation Army, published in the People's Daily on July 13th, vividly and figuratively describes the thriving atmosphere in the new Chinese countryside and the close relationship between the government and the people.

    From this article, we can see the joyful and happy scenes in the countryside. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the peasants are confidently building a better life. "Ruinous walls and dilapidated houses are nowhere to be seen," and "rows of new houses" have been built; the number of draught animals and farm implements has increased sharply; the peasants have begun to organize themselves, and advanced farming methods are being spread; the population has increased rapidly; the children have entered schools: happy days have begun.

    Under the education of the Communist Party, the peasants' ability to manage their own affairs has been brought into play. The village chief and Third Sister-in-law mentioned in the article powerfully illustrate this point. A peasant who was once forced to flee famine by the reactionary rulers is now elected as the village chief, and his work is "one of the best in the township." Third Sister-in-law, a "foolish" woman who was once looked down upon and often beaten and scolded, is now the deputy township head, and when she handles things, she is "organized and methodical, just like a political instructor in a company." The motherland is growing, the people are growing, and everything is progressing by leaps and bounds! This is a true reflection of our new China.

    The people's government's meticulous care for the peasants is fully demonstrated in a small matter such as the township government notifying the peasants in the middle of the night to "press down the wheat stacks to prevent typhoons." The peasants actively pay public grain and donate airplanes and cannons, and enthusiastically respond to the call of the people's government. They say: "The people's government is truly our government. Now, whatever the government tells us to do, we don't hesitate." They know that without Chairman Mao, there would be no good days today! They piously hang Chairman Mao's portrait in the center of the room, where the idols used to be.

    This article describes the situation of a village, but it reflects the general scene of rural areas across the country moving forward. As an author who is a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, he naturally has deep feelings for all of this. However, when he thinks of the fact that American imperialism is carrying out a frenzied invasion in Korea, threatening the peaceful construction of the motherland, how can he not hate the enemy! "I will never allow the American devils to turn the thousands of villages in the motherland, as happy as my hometown, into piles of ashes... I will not allow the invaders to touch a single hair of the motherland!" This is precisely the common loud voice and heroic spirit of all the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army!

    After reading "A Trip to My Hometown," a surge of heat rises from the bottom of my heart, making me excited. The great motherland and the hardworking people are no longer abstract concepts. I think this article is an excellent patriotic teaching material and deserves to be recommended to readers.
                                                                                                           Qian Tonggang

### 从“故乡记行”一文看伟大祖国的新面貌

    从“故乡记行”一文看伟大祖国的新面貌
    编辑同志：人民日报七月十三日发表的人民解放军空军战士华晨同志写的“故乡记行”一文，生动地、形象地描述了新中国农村中欣欣向荣的气象和政府与人民的亲密关系。
    从这篇文章里，我们可以看到农村中欢乐、幸福的情景。在共产党的领导下，农民们正满怀信心地建设着美好的生活。“残墙、烂屋看不到了”，“成片的新屋”盖了起来；耕畜和农具激增着；农民已开始组织起来，先进的耕作方法在传播着；人口迅速地增加了；孩子们进了学校：幸福的日子开始了。
    在共产党的教育下，农民们管理自己事务的能力发挥出来了。文章里提到的村长和三嫂，有力地说明了这一点。一个曾被反动统治者逼得逃荒要饭的农民，现在当选为村长，而且他的工作是“全乡数得着的”。过去被人家看不起、常常挨打受骂的“傻”女人——三嫂，现在当了副乡长，处理起事情来，“头头是道，简直像连队里的一个指导员”。祖国在成长，人民在成长，一切都在飞跃地进步！这正是我们新中国的写照。
    人民政府对农民无微不至的关怀，就在乡公所半夜通知农民“压好麦秸垛防台风”这样一件小事上，充分地表现出来。农民则积极缴公粮、捐献飞机大炮，热烈地响应人民政府的号召。他们说：“人民政府才真是咱们的政府。现在政府叫咱干啥，没二话。”他们知道，没有毛主席，就没有今天的好日子！他们虔诚地把毛主席的像挂在屋子正中过去的神台上。
    这篇文章描述的是一个村庄的情形，但它反映了全国各地农村在前进中的一般景象。作为一个人民解放军战士的作者，对这一切都自然地有着深厚的感情。但是，当他联想到美帝国主义正在朝鲜进行疯狂的侵略，威胁到祖国的和平建设的时候，他怎能不憎恨敌人呢！“我决不容许美国鬼子把像我故乡一样幸福的千万个祖国的乡村变成灰堆，……我不容许侵略者触动祖国的一根毫毛！”这正是全体人民解放军战士共同的响亮的声音和英雄的气概！
    读了“故乡记行”，从心底冒出了一股热力，使我振奋。伟大的祖国，勤劳的人民，已经不是抽象的概念了。我觉得这篇文章是一篇极好的爱国主义的教材，值得向读者推荐。    钱统纲
