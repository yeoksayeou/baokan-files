The agricultural achievements of Li Chenggui, a nationally renowned model for high rice yields, have drawn widespread attention from farmers, agricultural technicians, and agricultural experts across the country, particularly in Central and Southern China. This year, Hunan Province vigorously promoted Li Chenggui's high-yield experience in agricultural production. From the spring plowing to the summer harvest, farmers from Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan formed visiting groups to observe Li Chenggui's farming practices in Xiafang Village, Baofeng Township, Liling County, Li Chenggui's hometown. Reporters also continuously visited this village. Visitors and reporters praised Li Chenggui's intensive cultivation, good seedlings, and improvements in agricultural technology. The vast number of farmers were very concerned about Li Chenggui's high-yield field (totaling 1.18 mu), which was planned to produce a high yield of 1,500 jin per mu. Local farmers in Liling, when passing through Baofeng Township, always inquired, "How are Li Chenggui's high-yield field seedlings growing?" After hearing rumors of the high-yield field lodging (falling over), they asked with concern, "Have the seedlings in the high-yield field stood up?" When they learned that the rice in the high-yield field had already emerged and flowered, and the "seedling frame" had grown luxuriantly, and the grains had begun to fill, they happily looked forward to its high yield.

However, on July 11th, when the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry appraisal team inspected the early rice yield of Li Chenggui's mutual aid team in Baofeng Township, they discovered an unexpected situation. Li Chenggui's mutual aid team's total of more than 39 mu of land had an average yield of 605 jin, roughly completing half of this year's early and late rice high-yield plan. Li Chenggui's own 13.9 mu of early rice had an average yield of 710 jin, of which 2.24 mu yielded 750 jin per mu. However, the high-yield field alone had a yield of only 529 jin per mu, less than half of the estimated harvest of early and late rice, and lower than the production level of ordinary fields within the team. The farmers who came to visit Li Chenggui's mutual aid team's "ban he" (harvest) were somewhat disappointed. Farmers and some agricultural technicians who had seen the seedlings in the high-yield field regretted its unfortunate fate. The Liu Qikui mutual aid team and the Yao Guoqing mutual aid team in Baofeng Township automatically discussed the reasons for the reduced yield of Li Chenggui's high-yield field at night. The members of these mutual aid teams all "felt sorry" for the high-yield field, saying, "The high-yield field has been ruined!"

Why Didn't the "High-Yield Field" Achieve a High Yield?

The seedlings in the high-yield field grew so evenly, and the emergence of spikes was so uniform, with an average of 43 stalks per plant and 124 grains per spike. When the field was flowering, the visiting group from Xishui County, Hubei Province, praised the high-yield field, saying, "We haven't seen such good seedlings along the way!" But why did the high-yield field harvest less grain than ordinary fields? The main reason is that shortly after the rice in the high-yield field flowered, when the green grains were filling with white milky juice, the field lodged (previously it lodged once, but only a part of it, and because the sun came out, the seedlings stood up a bit, but after a few days it fell again and never stood up again). By the time the early rice was harvested, the seedlings had been lying down for more than ten days, the spikes were lying in the soil, the roots had begun to rot, the grains stopped filling, and many spikes had turned into "empty grains" (with husks but no rice).

The reason for the lodging and reduced yield of the high-yield field was mainly that the amount of fertilizer applied was not well-coordinated with deep plowing and other conditions. This year, Li Chenggui applied 84 loads of fertilizer to the high-yield field, more than twice the already substantial amount of fertilizer applied last year. However, the dramatic increase in fertilizer application was not commensurate with the degree of deep plowing and other cultivation conditions in the high-yield field. According to experts, because there was a lot of nitrogen fertilizer, the seedlings grew very vigorously in the early stages, and the seedling frame was very luxuriant, but the stems were weak, and the degree of deep plowing of the soil was insufficient, which led to the lodging. After the lodging, Li Chenggui drained the water from the high-yield field to let the sun dry the tilted stalks. Normally, two days would have been enough, but because Li Chenggui went to Jiangxi to buy cattle and was not at home, the high-yield field was not irrigated, and the local cadres did not solve the problem, resulting in six consecutive days of drying. The field cracked, and the stalks were dried out, making it even more impossible to stand up. Another reason for the reduced yield was that too many people went down to the field to visit the high-yield field. It is estimated that there were no less than 40 visits, with more than 1,000 people. Visitors went down to the field to count plants and spikes, measure the height of the rice and the depth of the soil with standard rulers, and even dug up the root soil to smell the odor of manure. A technician in a visiting group from a certain place even pulled up an entire plant with its roots, saying he wanted to take it back to "study pests and diseases." Many visitors took a few spikes of grain with them when they left the high-yield field.

Learn Lessons, Strive for Comprehensive Harvest

Li Chenggui is recognized by the farmers in his hometown as a "farming expert," and "generations have been soil scholars." Li Chenggui's intensive cultivation is outstanding. During the appraisal, a professor of soil research at Hunan Agricultural College said, "I checked back and forth in the high-yield field and couldn't find a single weed. The soil is loose and soft, and the original sticky 'green clay' bad soil has begun to deteriorate due to intensive cultivation and fertilization." Li Chenggui did his best to strive for a high yield. But after all, he is a farmer, and his high yield depends on his past long-term accumulated experience. When the yield is raised to a certain level, it is not enough to rely on this experience alone to raise it further. It becomes the responsibility of agricultural science and technology workers to continue to increase the yield of high-yield models. The setback in Li Chenggui's high-yield field this time, in the final analysis, exposes some serious shortcomings in the leadership's work in cultivating labor models, establishing agricultural production banners, and we must draw serious lessons from the leadership issues.

The relevant leading organs and the Liling County People's Government have not had a deep enough understanding of the political significance of cultivating labor models, supporting the creative cause of advanced figures, and establishing high-yield banners for a long time in the past. The specific manifestations are in the following aspects:

(1) Lack of scientific and technical guidance for Li Chenggui's high-yield work. Li Chenggui is a farmer with extremely rich cultivation experience, but appropriate scientific and technical guidance is still necessary for his production experience to be improved, systematized, and better utilized. The creation of high-yield records has various complex factors. For example, on the issue of fertilization, it is generally said that the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland is currently insufficient, and we must vigorously promote the accumulation and application of fertilizer; but simply blindly increasing fertilizer, without considering the conditions of varieties, soil, deep plowing, and fertilizer mixing, will be harmful to agricultural production. In the future, strengthening technical guidance in agricultural production and constantly paying attention to summarizing and improving advanced high-yield experiences to educate the vast number of farmers will be an extremely important link in leading production.

(2) Insufficient concern for Li Chenggui himself and his creative cause. Li Chenggui wasted a lot of time from spring plowing to summer harvest because of meetings (some meetings were completely unnecessary) and could not concentrate on his high-yield career. When thousands of visitors stepped on the rice in the field many times, which was enough to affect the growth of the seedlings, Zhang Shen, the deputy county head of Liling County, who was stationed in Baofeng Township, did not take the necessary measures to dissuade visitors from stepping on the rice in the field. This shows that the leadership lacked sufficient concern for Li Chenggui's production.

(3) Lack of specific cultivation and political and ideological education for Li Chenggui's mutual aid team. The challenge plan issued by the mutual aid team to the whole country was formulated in early January 1952, and after its formulation, the county party committee universally issued it to various townships for reference, and all national newspapers published it in unison in early April. However, this plan was only formally inspected once at the end of June. During the inspection, it was found that the plan posted on the wall was missing, and Deputy County Head Zhang Shen and other cadres did not remember the specific content of the high-yield plan. Some poor and hired peasant members of the mutual aid team had very poor production conditions, and the yield per mu was as low as 300 jin, which was still far behind the production level of ordinary farmers in the township, thus affecting the high yield of the entire mutual aid team. When Li Chenggui was not at home, no one took care of irrigating his high-yield field, which further shows that this mutual aid team has not sufficiently exerted the role of being organized. There were some shortcomings in the evaluation of work points and labor prices in this mutual aid team; the mutual aid team's patriotic increase in production challenge plan did not become the action of every member. This shows that the leadership's understanding of cultivating labor models and the direction of agricultural production development is still very vague.

(4) The farmers said: "Lodging halves the harvest." When it came to the on-site appraisal, Li Chenggui's high-yield field had been lying down for more than ten days, but the leading cadres from the county to the township blindly said: "There is no problem, it is above 1,000 jin." And they organized farmers' representatives from all over Hunan Province to visit. This shows that there is a blind complacency and a bureaucratic style of not conducting in-depth inspections in the leadership of agricultural production, which is extremely harmful.

We must learn from the setbacks suffered by Li Chenggui's high-yield field and strive for a comprehensive harvest in 1952. Now Li Chenggui and the members of his mutual aid team are determined to grow late rice well. Li Chenggui also accepted the suggestion of the technical guidance cadres to try dense planting in 1.18 mu of late rice field, changing the original plant spacing of 1.2 chi and row spacing of 1.2 chi to 1 chi each, planting 1,200 more plants per mu than before. Their confidence is still very strong; the problem is that the relevant parties should provide practical and conscientious assistance. At the same time, it is necessary to explain to the masses the reasons why Li Chenggui's "high-yield field" did not achieve a high yield, to prevent the possible growth of conservative ideas as a result.

    李呈桂的“丰产田”为什么没有丰收
    雷金　方堤　罗光裳
    全国著名水稻丰产模范李呈桂在农业生产上的成就，已引起全国特别是中南各地农民、农业技术人员和农业专家们的广泛注意。今年湖南全省在农业生产中大力推广了李呈桂的丰产经验。从春耕到夏收，湖北、江西和湖南各地农民纷纷组成参观团，到李呈桂的家乡——醴陵县保丰乡夏坊村去观摩李呈桂的耕作情况。记者们也不断地访问这个村庄。参观的人和访问的人，都称赞李呈桂的精耕细作、良好的禾苗和农业技术上的改进。广大农民对李呈桂那块计划创造每亩一千五百斤高额产量的丰产田
    （共一亩一分八厘）十分关心，醴陵当地的农民路过保丰乡时，总要探问一下：“李呈桂的丰产田禾苗长得怎样了？”他们听到丰产田倒禾的传闻后，便关心地问：“丰产田的禾苗爬起来了吗？”当他们知道丰产田的稻子已出穗放苞，“苗架”已长得茂盛，谷子已开始灌浆时，便高兴地盼望它的丰收。
    七月十一日湖南省农林厅评比小组到保丰乡察看李呈桂互助组的早稻产量时，却发现了一种意外的情况。李呈桂互助组全组三十九亩多田，平均产量六百零五斤，大致上完成了今年早晚两季稻丰产计划的一半。李呈桂自己的十三亩九分田早稻，平均产量是七百一十斤，其中二亩二分四厘田，每亩产量达七百五十斤；惟独那块丰产田每亩产量只有五百二十九斤，不及早晚两季稻预计收获量的一半，而且低于组内一般田的生产水平。前来参观李呈桂互助组“扮禾”（收获）的农民都有些失望。曾经看见过丰产田禾苗的农民和一些农业技术人员，都惋惜丰产田的不幸遭遇。保丰乡刘起逵互助组和姚国卿互助组在夜晚自动讨论李呈桂丰产田减产的原因。这些互助组的组员们都替丰产田“抱不平”，大家说：“丰产田糟蹋了！”
    “丰产田”为什么没有丰收
    丰产田的禾苗长得那样匀称，出穗那样整齐，每蔸平均生长禾秆四十三根，每穗结谷一百二十四粒；放苞扬花时，湖北省浠水县参观团还称赞丰产田说：“一路上来，还没看到过这样好的禾苗呢！”但是为什么丰产田收的谷却比普通田还少呢？基本原因是丰产田的稻子扬花放苞后不久，青色的谷粒正在灌注白色的乳浆时，却倒禾了（以前倒禾一次，但只倒了一部分，后因出太阳，禾苗起来了一些，但过几天再倒下后，就再没起来了）。早稻收割时禾苗已经倒了十多天，穗子倒伏在泥土里，根部开始腐烂，谷粒不再灌浆，很多谷穗都变成了“乙谷子”（有壳无米的空谷子）。
    倒禾和使丰产田减产的原因，主要是施肥量没有和深耕等条件配合好。今年李呈桂在丰产田中上了八十四担肥料，超过去年已经相当丰足的施肥量一倍以上。但是施肥量激增的情况和丰产田的深耕程度及其他耕作条件是不相称的。据专家们说，因为氮肥很多，禾苗在前一个时期长得很猛，苗架很茂盛，但茎部软弱，而泥土深耕的程度又很不够，以致发生了倒禾的现象。倒禾以后，李呈桂曾将丰产田的水放干，让太阳把倾斜的禾秆晒起来。照例，晒两天就足够了；但因李呈桂到江西去买牛，不在家，丰产田没有灌水，当地干部又没解决这个问题，结果一连晒了六天，田都开坼了，禾秆晒“痨”了，更站不起来了。减产的另一个原因是前来参观丰产田的人下田踩得太多了。据估计前后不下四十余次，一千多人。参观者都下到田间去数禾蔸，数穗子，用标准尺测量禾高和土深，甚至将根土挖起来嗅嗅粪肥的气息。某地参观团中的一位技术人员竟将整个一棵禾连蔸拔起来，说要带回去“研究病虫害”。不少参观者在离开丰产田时都带上几根谷穗回去了。
    吸取教训，争取全面丰收
    李呈桂在自己的家乡被农民们公认为“作田里手”，“辈辈都是泥秀才”。李呈桂的精耕细作是出色的。评比时，湖南农学院的一位研究土壤的教授说：“我在丰产田里来回检查，找不到一根杂草，土壤松软，原先带有粘性的“青夹泥”的坏土壤，已由于精耕和施肥开始变质了。”李呈桂为了争取丰产，是尽了他自己的力量的。但他究竟是一个农民，他的丰产是靠过去长期积累的经验。产量提高到一定程度，再要提高，只凭这经验就不够了。继续提高丰产模范的产量，这就成为农业科学技术工作者的责任了。这次李呈桂丰产田的挫折，归根结底，暴露了领导方面在培养劳动模范、树立农业生产旗帜的工作中有些严重的缺点，必须从领导问题上吸取严重的教训。
    有关的领导机关和醴陵县人民政府，过去长时期对于培养劳动模范、支持先进人物的创造性的事业及树立丰产旗帜的政治意义，是认识得不够深刻的。具体的表现在以下几个方面：
    （一）对李呈桂的丰产工作缺乏科学和技术上的指导。李呈桂是个耕作经验极为丰富的农民，但是，还必须有适当的科学技术的指导，他的生产经验才能提高，才能系统化，才能更好地发挥作用。高额产量纪录的创造，有各种复杂的因素。例如施肥问题，一般说目前农田施肥量是不足的，还要大力提倡积肥和施肥；但仅仅盲目地增加肥料，而不顾及品种、土壤、深耕及肥料混合等各方面的条件，反会有害于农业生产。今后在农业生产上加强技术指导，并不断注意总结提高先进的丰产经验，用以教育广大农民，将是领导生产中极其重要的环节。
    （二）对李呈桂本人以及他的创造性的事业关心不够。李呈桂从春耕到夏收，因开会而浪费的时间是很多的（有些会完全不必要参加），不能集中精力在他的丰产事业上。当成千的参观者历次下田踩禾，足以影响禾苗的成长时，长驻保丰乡的醴陵县副县长张伸同志竟未作必要的措施，劝止参观者下田踩禾。这说明领导方面对李呈桂的生产缺少足够的关心。
    （三）对李呈桂互助组缺乏具体培养和政治思想教育。互助组向全国发出的挑战计划是在一九五二年一月初订立的，订立后并由县委普遍印发各乡参考，四月初全国各报一致刊载。但是这个计划仅仅在六月底被形式主义地检查过一次。在检查时，发现贴在墙上的计划不见了，副县长张伸和其他干部都不记得丰产计划的具体内容了。互助组内有的贫雇农成员生产条件很差，每亩产量竟有低到三百多斤的，还远远落后于本乡一般农民的生产水平，因此使整个互助组的丰产受到影响。李呈桂不在家时他的丰产田就没人照料灌水，这更说明这个互助组还没有足够地发挥组织起来的作用。这个互助组在评工记分、工价问题上都存在着一些缺点；互助组的爱国增产的挑战计划没有变成每个成员的行动。这说明领导方面对培养劳动模范和农业生产发展方向的认识还很模糊。
    （四）农民们说：“倒禾收一半。”临到实地评比时，李呈桂的丰产田已经倒禾十几天了，从县到乡的领导干部却还盲目地说：“没有问题，在一千斤以上。”并且还组织了湖南全省各地农民代表参观。这说明在农业生产的领导工作中存在着一种盲目自满的情绪和不深入检查的官僚主义作风，这是极端有害的。
    我们要从李呈桂的丰产田所遭到的挫折中吸取教训，争取一九五二年的全面丰收。现在李呈桂和他的互助组的组员们，决心要把晚稻种好。李呈桂并接受技术指导干部的建议，在一市亩一分八厘的晚稻田中试行密植，把原来的株距行距各一尺二寸改为各一尺，每亩较前多插一千二百蔸禾。他们的信心仍然很足；问题在于有关方面应该加以切实认真的帮助。同时，要在群众中解释李呈桂的“丰产田”没有丰收的原因，防止因此可能增长的保守思想。
