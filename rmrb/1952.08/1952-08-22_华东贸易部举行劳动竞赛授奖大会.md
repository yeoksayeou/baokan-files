The East China Military and Administrative Committee's Trade Department held an award ceremony for its various specialized district companies' patriotic rotating Red Flag labor competition, which successfully concluded its first phase from July 1st to July 31st. The award ceremony, attended by over 10,000 people, was held on August 9th. Zeng Shan, Vice Chairman of the East China Military and Administrative Committee, Hong Ze, Deputy Director of the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Shen Han, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, attended the meeting to offer their congratulations and provide work instructions.

Under the correct leadership and assistance of the Party committees, administrative bodies, and trade unions at all levels in the East China region, the Red Flag labor competition movement among district-level companies fully mobilized the masses and achieved remarkable results. Due to the implementation of the competition, in July, the state-owned trading companies in the entire East China region completed 105.4 percent of their supply targets and 104 percent of their sales targets, with sales volume more than doubling compared to July of the previous year. The erroneous idea that trade departments could not participate in competitions, which was held by many people before the competition, has been eliminated. Many leading cadres have realized that only by mobilizing the masses can all work be done well, and they have begun to go deep into the masses and establish close relationships with them. Due to the establishment of liaison contracts, work in various departments has been closely integrated, and the spirit of unity and mutual assistance has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Due to improvements in the work system and increased work efficiency, many companies and departments that used to work overtime have eliminated overtime during the competition.

The judging committee of the rotating Red Flag labor competition of various specialized district companies under the East China Trade Department awarded prizes based on three criteria: "the degree of completion of various targets," "the quality of policy implementation," and "the degree of mobilization of the masses to carry out rationalization proposals." The East China District Company of the China Industrial Equipment Company came in first place, won the Red Flag, and received a bonus of 12 million yuan. The second and third places went to the East China District Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company and the East China District Company of the China Grain Company, respectively, who also received bonuses. The East China District Company of the China Petroleum Company achieved significant results in mobilizing the masses, and the company's trade union received a bonus of 5 million yuan. The East China District Company of the China Native Produce Company achieved significant results in completing its tasks and was commended at the meeting.

In July, the rationalization proposal movement launched by various district-level specialized companies in the East China region received a total of 3,778 proposals, many of which were very valuable. Twenty-eight outstanding units and individuals who submitted rationalization proposals received bonuses ranging from 3 million to 500,000 yuan.

Zeng Shan, Vice Chairman of the East China Military and Administrative Committee, Hong Ze, Deputy Director of the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Shen Han, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, delivered speeches at the meeting. Representatives of the winning units and winners of rationalization proposal awards unanimously expressed in their speeches that they would accept the instructions of the leaders, remain modest and prudent, and strive for greater achievements. Various units also put forward August competition targets and letters of determination, and launched challenges to each other.

    华东贸易部举行劳动竞赛授奖大会
    华东军政委员会贸易部所属各专业区公司爱国主义循环红旗劳动竞赛，自七月一日起到七月三十一日止，第一阶段已胜利结束。八月九日，举行了一万多人的授奖大会。华东军政委员会副主席曾山，中华全国总工会华东办事处副主任洪泽和上海总工会副主席沈涵都到会祝贺并指示工作。
    华东区各区级公司的红旗劳动竞赛运动，在各级中共党委、行政、工会的正确领导帮助下，充分发动了群众，获得了显著的成绩。由于展开了竞赛，七月份全华东区国营贸易公司投放任务完成了百分之一百零五点四，销货任务完成了百分之一百零四，销货额比去年七月份增加了一倍以上。不少人在竞赛前认为贸易部门不能竞赛的错误思想已经消除了。许多领导干部已认识到只有发动群众，一切工作才能做好，他们开始深入群众，与群众建立了密切的关系。各部门由于订立了联系合同，工作已能密切结合，团结互助的精神空前提高。由于工作制度的改进和工作效率的提高，许多一向加班加点的公司、部门，在竞赛中已消灭了加班加点的现象。
    华东贸易部所属各专业区公司循环红旗劳动竞赛评奖委员会根据“完成各项指标的程度”、“执行政策的好坏”和“发动群众开展合理化建议的程度”等三个标准进行了评奖。中国工业器材公司华东区公司为第一，夺得了红旗，并得到奖金一千二百万元。第二、第三名为中国花纱布公司华东区公司和中国粮食公司华东区公司，他们也分别得到了奖金。中国石油公司华东区公司在发动群众方面有显著成绩，该公司工会得奖金五百万元。中国土产公司华东区公司在完成任务方面有显著成绩，在大会上得到了表扬。
    华东区各区级专业公司七月份开展的合理化建议运动，共收到了各种建议三千七百七十八件，其中有不少很有价值。有二十八个合理化建议优胜单位和个人，分别得到三百万元到五十万元不等的奖金。
    华东军政委员会曾山副主席，中华全国总工会华东办事处洪泽副主任，上海总工会沈涵副主席在大会上发表了演说。得奖单位代表、合理化建议得奖者在发言中一致表示接受首长们的指示，不骄不躁，为争取更大的成绩而努力。各单位并纷纷提出八月份竞赛指标和决心书，互相展开挑战。
