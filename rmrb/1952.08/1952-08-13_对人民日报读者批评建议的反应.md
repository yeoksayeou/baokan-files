Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions Regarding the People's Daily

    Editor's Note: We are now publishing below a summary of the responses from various relevant parties to the criticisms and suggestions made by readers of the People's Daily.

    ▲ The Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Public Health Engineering, based on the suggestion of reader Zhang Jin (original suggestion published in this column on June 18th), inspected the Yuhe Bridge project and discovered that some bridge sections constructed last winter had been damaged because they were not built strictly according to the original design. They have sent workers to repair the damage and have criticized the personnel responsible for construction and acceptance. To avoid such errors from recurring, they have decided to strengthen the acceptance system, stipulate quality standards, and conduct regular inspections.

    ▲ Zhang Mei, Director of the Chengzi Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, wrote to accept the criticism from reader Bei Fang (original criticism published in this column on June 25th) and conducted a self-criticism regarding the issue of workers taking sick leave at the mine. The number of workers taking sick leave at the mine has been increasing monthly, with the number in June more than double that of January. The main reasons for this are inadequate sanitation work and insufficient political education for employees within the mine. The mine is now actively working to improve this situation. The mine has stipulated necessary leave procedures based on different circumstances of injury, illness, and personal leave, and it does not require "at least seven procedures" as mentioned in Comrade Bei Fang's letter. However, it is true that the personnel section was not sufficiently concerned about the workers' difficulties and had a rigid attitude when managing the worker's leave system, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers. This will be corrected in the future.

    ▲ The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government believes that the suggestion from reader Wang Lu regarding "returning the photos of unsuccessful applicants after school enrollment in various middle schools" (original suggestion published in this column on July 9th) is correct. They have notified the local education administrative departments to inform their affiliated enrollment committees and secondary schools to return the photos of unsuccessful applicants.

    ▲ The General Office of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government accepted the opinion of reader Siqin (original opinion published in this column on July 16th). In the past, the office had only four Mongolian-language secretaries, but there were many documents, so they could only adopt a method of prioritized translation. Documents with a focus on agricultural areas were no longer translated into Mongolian. However, some departments did not attach enough importance to the work of translating official documents, resulting in the omission of certain documents that should have been translated, such as the investigation of livestock mortality mentioned by Comrade Siqin. Many Mongolian cadres in the province have raised opinions on this issue many times, but it could not be resolved in a timely manner due to the lack of translation cadres. The province is now actively cultivating translation cadres and has established a Mongolian translation section within the General Office, adding four translation cadres in order to strengthen the work of translating official documents.

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    编者按：今将各有关方面对人民日报读者批评建议的反应摘要发表于后。
    ▲北京市人民政府卫生工程局根据读者张瑾的建议（原建议刊六月十八日本栏），检查了御河桥桥梁工程，发现去年冬季修建的某些桥梁，因为没有严格地按照原来的设计施工，现已发生损坏现象。他们已派工前往修理，并对负责施工及验收的人员提出批评。为了避免此种错误再度发生，他们决定加强验收制度，规定质量标准，经常进行检查工作。
    ▲京西矿务局城子矿矿长张梅来信，接受读者北方的批评（原批评刊六月二十五日本栏），对于该矿工人请病假的问题作了检讨。该矿请病假的工人逐月增加，六月份的病假工比一月份增加了一倍多。其主要原因是矿内卫生工作和职工的政治教育工作做得不好。该矿现正积极改进这种情况。该矿根据伤、病、事假的不同情况，分别规定了必要的请假手续，并不像北方同志来信所说“至少要经过七道手续”。但人事股在掌握工人请假制度时，对工人疾苦关心不够，态度生硬，以致引起工人不满，确是事实。今后将要加以改正。
    ▲中央人民政府教育部认为读者王鲁关于“各地中学招生后应退还未录取者的相片”的建议（原建议刊七月九日本栏）是正确的。他们已通知各地教育行政部门转知所属招生委员会及中等学校，退还未录取者的照片。
    ▲绥远省人民政府办公厅接受读者斯琴的意见
    （原意见刊七月十六日本栏）。该厅过去只有四个蒙文秘书，但文件很多，只能采取重点翻译的办法。凡重点在农业地区的文件就不再译成蒙文。但某些部门对翻译公文工作重视不够，以致某些应该翻译的文件，像斯琴同志提出的调查牲畜死亡情况的公文，也有漏译现象。该省很多蒙族干部对这个问题曾多次提出意见，但因翻译干部缺乏，未能及时解决。该省现正积极培养翻译干部，并已在办公厅内设立蒙文翻译课，增加了四个翻译干部，以便加强公文翻译工作。
