To the Editor:

During the construction of a muffle furnace at the Taiyuan Machine Factory, two different technical approaches led to two different outcomes.

The muffle furnace is a piece of equipment used for heat-treating various machine parts. The Taiyuan Machine Factory planned to add this equipment at the end of 1950 to improve product quality. However, the initial large muffle furnace that was built was scrapped.

The process was as follows: Engineer Tian Cun was responsible for the design. He had achieved some success in other work; however, he did not fully understand the principles of a muffle furnace. Under the sway of arrogance and complacency, he relied on some Japanese technical books and, sitting in his office, drew up the blueprints for the large muffle furnace. Afterwards, he did not seek the opinions of veteran workers and technicians, only exchanging some academic opinions with a few engineers. He did not discuss at all important issues such as whether the furnace could be used or what the effects of its use would be. When the construction of the large muffle furnace began, workers pointed out that the furnace belly was too small, the chimney too large, and the flue too long, but this did not attract the attention of Engineer Tian Cun. After a year and an expenditure of 178.8 million yuan, the large muffle furnace was built. However, during testing, it used three tons of coal and burned for two full days and nights to reach 940 degrees, which was still 300 degrees short of the required heat. Thus, the large muffle furnace could not be used.

The failure of the large muffle furnace not only wasted a large amount of state resources, but more seriously, it affected the rapid improvement of product quality. At this time, veteran technical worker and production team leader Gu Zhixian and technician Xu Jin were very anxious and tried to solve this problem. They first used more than one hundred bricks to build a small furnace, which proved to be very effective in tests. Later, they received support from the factory leadership and assistance from another technician, Shi Yuqing, and finally completed the design of a small heat treatment furnace.

When the construction of the small heat treatment furnace began, many parts were missing. Waiting to make new ones would be time-consuming and expensive. At this time, the workers welded the furnace frame with scrap copper and used scrap iron sheets to replace the chimney. If there were small parts missing, they looked for them in the scrap iron pile. In this way, in just seven days, at a cost of less than two million yuan, the small heat treatment furnace was successfully built. The test results showed that the heat quickly reached 1200 degrees, and it only required 100 jin of coke fuel per day. The success of the small heat treatment furnace was the result of the close combination of workers and technicians.

This incident clearly tells us that Engineer Tian Cun made mistakes in the design of the large muffle furnace because he only valued Japanese technical books and did not value the suggestions of workers with practical production experience; he only drew pictures in the office and did not do practical experiments and research. Therefore, the result of dogmatic design that is divorced from reality is bound to be wrong. From what I understand, there are quite a few technicians with this kind of error, so I suggest that technicians must undergo ideological transformation. Only by correcting this one-sided and subjective way of thinking can we combine theoretical knowledge with practical experience, and only then can technicians and workers be better combined.

### 太原机器厂建设马弗尔炉时  两种技术思想造成两种后果

    太原机器厂建设马弗尔炉时
    两种技术思想造成两种后果
    编辑同志：太原机器厂在建设马弗尔炉时，由于两种不同技术思想的指导，引起了两种不同的后果。
    马弗尔炉是热处理各种机件的设备。太原机器厂为了提高产品质量，一九五○年底即计划增加这种设备。但最初建设的大马弗尔炉却报废了。
    事情的经过是这样：负责设计工程的是田村工程师。他在其他工作中曾作出一些成绩；但他并不太懂得马弗尔炉的原理。他在骄傲自满情绪的支配下，根据一些日本技术书籍，坐在办公室里，便把大马弗尔炉的图样绘出来。事后，他没有征求老工人和技术人员的意见，只和几位工程师交换了一些学术性问题的意见。他对于炉子究竟能否使用及使用效果如何等重要问题，则根本没有谈到。大马弗尔炉开始修建时，工人见到炉腹小、烟囱大、烟道太长，曾提过意见，但并没有引起田村工程师的重视。经过一年时间，化了一亿七千八百余万元，大马弗尔炉造成了，但在试验时用了三吨煤，烧了整整两昼夜，热量才达九百四十度，较实际需要热量还差三百度。大马弗尔炉就这样不能用了。
    大马弗尔炉的失败，不只浪费了国家大量财富，更严重的是影响了产品质量的迅速提高。这时，老技术工人、生产小组长谷智仙和技术员徐进都很着急，就捉摸着来解决这个问题。他们先用一百多块砖，做了个小炉，经试验效果很好。后来他们得到了工厂领导上的支持、又得到另一个技术人员石玉庆的帮助，终于完成了一座小热处理炉的设计工作。
    小热处理炉修建工程开始时，好多种零件都没有。如等着作新的，既费时间又费钱。这时，工人们便以废铜料焊成炉架子，废铁皮代替烟囱；缺小零件，到废铁堆去找。就这样，只短短七天时间，化了不到二百万元，小热处理炉便建造成功了。试炉结果，热量很快就达到一千二百度，而且每天只需要一百斤焦炭的燃料。小热处理炉的成功，是工人与技术人员紧密结合的结晶。
    这一件事，清楚地告诉了我们：田村工程师在设计大马弗尔炉时所以会犯错误，是因为他只重视日本技术书籍，不重视有实际生产经验的工人的建议；只坐在屋子里画图，而不做实际的试验和研究工作。因此，脱离实际的教条主义的设计，其结果必然是错误的。据我了解，有这种错误的技术人员还不是少数，所以我建议技术人员必须进行思想改造。只有纠正了这种片面主观的思想方法，才能把理论知识和实际经验相结合，也才能使技术人员和工人更好地相结合。张玉田
