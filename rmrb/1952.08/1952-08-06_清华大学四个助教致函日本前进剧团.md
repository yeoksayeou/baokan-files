    Four Teaching Assistants from Tsinghua University Send a Letter to the Japanese Zenshinza Theatre Company
    Dear Comrades of the Zenshinza Theatre Company: We extend our respects to the heroic Japanese people in their struggle, and we wish you complete victory!
    On May Day 1952, when the happy Chinese youth, with flowers, doves, and red flags, cheered in front of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, we did not forget that four million Japanese laborers were also bravely holding parades under the guns and bayonets of the reactionaries. In the face of such a powerful mass force, the reactionaries were defeated, and you achieved a glorious victory.
    Comrades, we are particularly concerned about your struggle. Because we have suffered from the oppression and devastation of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries for the past century, especially in the last few decades. They pushed the people's lives into an abyss of disaster, a tragic situation we will never forget. Today, the US-Japanese reactionaries are similarly creating unemployment, hunger, and death in Japan. The great Chinese Communist Party, leading the great Chinese people, rose up and defeated the enemy. 500 million people have already built a prosperous and happy country in Asia, launched a great economic construction, and defeated the most ferocious US imperialism. Therefore, we believe that the power of the people is invincible, and you will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve a great victory in your struggle.
    Comrades, we are particularly concerned about your struggle. Because today, the goals of the people's struggle around the world are the same: to strive for world peace and people's democracy, and to strive for a happy and prosperous future for mankind. A handful of warmongers are spreading bacteria in Korea, supporting Nazi elements in West Germany, and rebuilding militarism in Japan. They want to turn prosperous cities into ashes and drown peaceful people in a sea of blood. They are the most vicious enemies in human history. Wherever there is decay, darkness, and reaction, there are their footprints. And any struggle of yours, ours, and the people of the world directly strikes at these beasts, defending and striving for peace and the happiness of the people. Therefore, comrades, your victory and our victory are inseparable. We firmly believe that the Japanese people, in their arduous struggle, will eventually achieve victory and strive to live a peaceful and happy life like us.
    Comrades, your struggle is arduous and tortuous, but with the support of the working people of the world and the leadership of the Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism, you will achieve victory. The material support we few individuals can give you is very small (3.5 million RMB in donations – editor), but we are willing to offer you an even more precious gift, that is, the rich experience of the Chinese Communist Party's revolutionary struggle, concentrated in the works of the great Chairman Mao. This is a treasure trove of the source of all victories in struggle. The heroic Japanese people in their struggle can draw from here the experience of the Chinese people in defeating domestic and foreign reactionaries. We believe that progressive Japanese literary and art workers can draw greater inspiration from Chairman Mao's works, especially from documents related to literary and art theory such as "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and become stronger, wiser, and more powerful in the struggle!
    Comrades, let us celebrate the great victory of your heroic struggle with the new achievements of our great peaceful construction!
    Long live the great internationalist solidarity!

    清华大学四个助教致函日本前进剧团
    亲爱的前进剧团同志们：我们谨向英勇斗争中的日本人民致敬，并预祝你们获得完全的胜利！
    一九五二年“五一”节，当幸福的中国青年队伍带着鲜花、鸽子和红旗，在北京天安门前欢呼的时候，我们并没有忘记：日本的四百万劳动人民正在反动派的枪弹、刺刀之下英勇地同样举行了游行。在这样一个强大的群众队伍面前，反动派是失败了，你们取得了光辉的胜利。
    同志们，我们特别关心你们的斗争。因为我们在过去一百年来，尤其是最后数十年中，饱受了帝国主义和国民党反动派的压迫和摧残。他们把人民的生活推到了灾难的深渊，这种悲惨的情况是我们永世也不会忘记的。今天美日反动派正同样在日本制造失业、饥饿和死亡。伟大的中国共产党领导着伟大的中国人民奋起战胜了敌人，五万万人民已经在亚洲建立起富强康乐的国家，展开了伟大的经济建设，并且打败了最凶恶的美帝国主义。因此，我们相信，人民的力量是不可战胜的，你们在斗争中必然将战胜一切困难取得伟大的胜利。
    同志们，我们特别关怀你们的斗争。因为在今天，全世界人民斗争的目标是一致的，都是为了争取世界和平与人民民主，争取人类幸福美好的未来。一小撮战争贩子们，在朝鲜撒下细菌，在西德扶植纳粹分子，在日本重建军国主义，他们想把繁华的都市变成灰烬，把和平的人民沉溺在血海之中；他们是人类历史上最凶恶的敌人，那里有腐朽黑暗与反动的东西，那里就有着他们的足迹。而你们、我们和全世界人民的任何一个斗争都直接打击着这群野兽，保卫和争取着和平和人民的幸福。因此，同志们，你们的胜利和我们的胜利是分不开的。我们深信，在艰苦斗争中的日本人民，最后必能取得胜利，争取过着和我们一样的和平幸福的生活。
    同志们，你们的斗争是艰苦的，曲折的，但是，有着世界劳动人民的支援，有着用马克思列宁主义武装起来的共产党的领导，你们将取得胜利。我们几个人给你们的物质上的支援是很小的（三百五十万元人民币的捐款—编者），但是我们愿意献给你们一件更宝贵的礼物，那就是由伟大的毛主席的著作中所集中表现的中国共产党丰富的革命斗争经验，这是一切斗争胜利源泉的宝库，英勇斗争中的日本人民可以从这里吸取中国人民击败国内外反动派的经验。我们相信进步的日本文艺工作同志可以从毛主席的著作中，特别是像“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”等有关文艺理论的文件中，得到更大的启发，而在斗争中更坚强，更智慧，更有力！
    同志们，让我们用伟大的和平建设的新成就来庆贺你们英勇斗争的伟大胜利！
    伟大的国际主义团结万岁！
