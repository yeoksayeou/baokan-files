Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd—The draft of the new Party Charter prepared by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) has been published.

As everyone knows, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has revised its Party Charter several times in the past due to changes in circumstances, new tasks, and work experience. In 1922, when the CPSU shifted from retreat to preparing for an offensive after a year of implementing the New Economic Policy; in 1925, when the CPSU proposed the task of socialist industrialization; in 1934, when the CPSU proposed the Second Five-Year Plan to basically complete the task of socialist construction; and in 1939, when the Soviet Union completed the task of socialist construction and advanced towards communism, the Party Charter was revised. During these stages, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the Soviet people in completing unprecedentedly great work in human history. Now, as the Soviet Union is about to take a big step towards communism, the CPSU Central Committee has prepared a new draft Party Charter.

The new draft Party Charter is divided into twelve chapters and seventy-one articles. The title of the first chapter is "The Party. Party Members and the Obligations and Rights of Party Members." The title of the second chapter is "Candidate Members." The title of the third chapter is "The Organizational Structure of the Party and Intra-Party Democracy." The title of the fourth chapter is "The Highest Organs of the Party." The remaining chapters concern the structure, election, and work of Party organizations at all levels, as well as regulations regarding Party finances.

The new draft Party Charter states: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a voluntary fighting alliance composed of like-minded communists from the working class, working peasants, and working intellectuals. Its main tasks at present are: to build a communist society by gradually transitioning from socialism to communism, steadily improving the material and cultural standards of society, educating members of society in the spirit of internationalism and fraternal ties with the working people of all countries, and vigorously strengthening the socialist motherland’s active defense against acts of aggression by its enemies.

According to the new draft Party Charter, any worker or citizen of the Soviet Union who does not exploit the labor of others, accepts the Party Program and Party Charter, actively promotes its realization, works within a Party organization, and implements all Party resolutions can join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The obligations of Party members are: to safeguard the unity of the Party in every possible way; to actively fight for the realization of Party resolutions; to serve as a model in labor, to master work techniques, and to constantly improve production and professional skills; to increasingly strengthen ties with the masses; to raise their class consciousness and master the principles of Marxism-Leninism; to abide by Party and state discipline; to develop self-criticism and criticism from below, to expose shortcomings in work and strive to eliminate them, to oppose complacency and being blinded by achievements; to report shortcomings in work to the Party's leading organs, up to the Party Central Committee; to be loyal to the Party; to guard Party and state secrets and maintain political vigilance; and to resolutely implement instructions on the correct selection of cadres in any position entrusted by the Party.

Regarding the highest organs of the Party, the new draft Party Charter stipulates: The Party Congress of the CPSU elects the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission. The Central Committee establishes a Presidium to handle the work of the Central Committee between plenary sessions of the Central Committee; establishes a Secretariat to handle day-to-day work, mainly organizing inspections of the implementation of Party resolutions and the selection of cadres; and establishes a Party Control Committee to conduct Party discipline inspections and other work. The Central Auditing Commission checks whether the handling of affairs by the central organs of the Party is prompt and correct, checks whether the work of the Central Committee Secretariat is smooth, and audits the accounts of the CPSU Central Finance Department and enterprises.

The new draft Party Charter of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will be submitted to the 19th Congress of the CPSU (Bolsheviks), which will be held on October 5, for discussion and adoption. (The full text of the draft can be found on page 3 of today's newspaper – Editor)

    联共中央公布新党章草案
    将提交联共第十九次代表大会讨论通过
    【新华社莫斯科二十二日电】苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会草拟的新党章草案业已公布。
    大家知道，由于环境的改变、新的任务和工作经验，苏联共产党以前曾数次对党章进行过修改。在一九二二年联共在执行新经济政策一年之后由退却转向准备进攻的时候，在一九二五年联共提出社会主义工业化任务的时候，在一九三四年联共提出要基本上完成社会主义建设任务的第二个五年计划的时候，在一九三九年当苏联完成社会主义建设任务并向共产主义前进的时候，都曾修改了党章。在这些阶段里，苏联共产党领导苏联人民完成了人类历史上空前伟大的工作。现在，当苏联要向共产主义前进一大步的时候，联共中央又拟好了新的党章草案。
    新党章草案共分十二章，七十一条。第一章的题目是“党。党员和党员的义务与权利”。第二章的题目是“候补党员”。第三章的题目是“党的组织结构和党内民主”。第四章的题目是“党的高级机关”。其余各章是关于各级党组织的结构、选举、工作等以及党的经费的规定。
    新党章草案说：苏联共产党是工人阶级、劳动农民和劳动知识分子中思想一致的共产主义者所组成的自愿的战斗联盟。目前它的主要任务是：以由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义来建立一个共产主义社会，稳步提高社会的物质和文化水平，以国际主义及对各国劳动人民建立兄弟联系的精神教育社会的成员，极度加强社会主义祖国对其敌人侵略行动的积极防御。
    按照新党章草案规定，苏联任何劳动者、任何公民，凡是不剥削他人的劳动，接受党纲和党章，积极促其实现，在党的一个组织内工作并执行党的一切决议的，都可以参加苏联共产党。党员的义务是：尽一切可能护卫党的统一；积极为实现党的决议而斗争；在劳动上起模范作用，精通工作技术，不断提高生产和业务技能；日益加强和群众的联系；提高自己的阶级觉悟，精通马克思主义—列宁主义的原则；遵守党和国家的纪律；发展自我批评与从下面的批评，揭露工作缺点并力求消灭工作缺点，反对表面成绩和因工作有成就而冲昏头脑；向党的领导机关一直到党中央委员会报告工作上的缺点；忠实于党；保守党和国家的机密，保持政治警惕性；在党所付托的任何岗位上坚决执行关于正确选拔干部的指示。
    关于党的高级机关，新党章草案规定：由联共的党代表大会选举中央委员会和中央检查委员会。由中央委员会成立主席团，在前后两次中央委员会全体会议之间处理中央委员会的工作；成立书记处，处理日常工作，主要是组织对党的决议执行情形进行检查和选拔干部的工作；成立党的监察委员会，进行党的纪律检查及其他工作。中央检查委员会检查党的中央机关事务处理得是否迅速和正确，检查中央委员会书记处机构的工作进行得是否顺畅，审查联共中央财务处和企业的账目。
    苏联共产党新党章草案将提交十月五日举行的联共（布）第十九次代表大会讨论和通过。（草案全文见今日本报第三版——编者）
