Xinhua News Agency, August 28th dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin on August 27th: The Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of a German peace treaty on August 23rd has been warmly welcomed by public opinion in the German Democratic Republic.

All democratic newspapers in Berlin published the full text of the Soviet government's note of August 23rd on the front page and issued commentaries.

The "Neues Deutschland" editorial pointed out that the Soviet government's note is another step taken by the Soviet Union towards a peaceful resolution of the German question. The paper said: "In its recent note, the Soviet government has put forward clear and concrete proposals that are acceptable to all parties. Whoever rejects this proposal is unwilling to solve the German problem, but is intent on dividing Germany and launching a war." Commenting on the Soviet proposal to invite representatives from both the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to participate in negotiations on the German question, the paper said: "It is difficult to find a German who cherishes the interests of the German people who would not welcome this Soviet proposal." The paper called on all German people to unite against the Bonn war treaty and strive for a solution to the German question on the basis of the Soviet proposal.

The "Berliner Zeitung" sharply criticized the attitude of the Western countries and the Bonn government in forcing the German people to accept the aggressive Bonn separate "treaty" and emphasized that the Soviet government's note of August 23rd once again proved to the German people that in their struggle for a peace treaty and national unity, the Soviet Union is their greatest friend.

"Tribune" said: The German people should, based on the proposals put forward in the Soviet note, use practical actions and words to make their just demands to the Western countries.

The Central Committee of the "Association of Victims of Nazism," one of the people's organizations in the German Democratic Republic, also issued a statement welcoming the new Soviet note. The statement said: The Soviet note has given us new courage and strength, enabling us to fight even more energetically against the Bonn war "treaty" and to fight for the main task of the German people at present - to strive for peace and unity.

Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: According to the German News Agency: The West German people support the Soviet government's note of August 23rd to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of a German peace treaty.

The Executive Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement on the new Soviet note on the 26th, pointing out that the primary task of the German people at present is to prevent the Federal Parliament from ratifying the "General Treaty" under any circumstances. The responsibility of the parliamentarians should be to implement the proposals put forward in the Soviet note and to reach an understanding with the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on preparations for holding all-German elections. Our most important task is to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty and must force the Federal Parliament to take action. The statement called: "German compatriots, you should express your opinions in various ways, you should organize rallies, you should send delegations to the parliament, you should organize demonstrations and various mass actions to express the people's desire for a peace treaty and opposition to the general war treaty." The statement also pointed out that more than eight million West German people recently expressed their desire for an immediate peace treaty in a public opinion poll. Members and staff of the Social Democratic Party have also expressed their desire for a peace treaty, general elections, and a unified Germany. This desire is in line with the Soviet proposals, and on this basis, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party can unite to fight for the realization of their common demands.

On the 25th, all West German newspapers published the new Soviet note under large headlines. The "Bonn Review" was headlined: "The Soviets are willing to make peace immediately," and the "Stuttgarter Zeitung" was headlined: "Moscow Replies: The Soviets are willing to hold a four-power conference in October at the latest." Many newspapers called for a thorough study of the Soviet note.

Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: According to TASS: The East European People's Democratic countries warmly support the Soviet government's note of August 23rd to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of a German peace treaty.

Polish newspapers published the Soviet government's note of August 23rd and issued commentaries expressing support for the Soviet government's new proposals. "People's Tribune" said: The Soviet note is another significant expression of the Soviet peace policy, which aims to ensure peace in Europe and satisfy the legitimate desire of the German people to establish a unified, independent, and democratic Germany. The paper denounced the Western countries for deepening the division of Germany and turning West Germany into a military springboard for attacking Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union, as well as a base for launching a civil war in Germany. "Warsaw Daily" wrote: "Polish public opinion warmly welcomes the Soviet government's proposal to convene a four-power conference as soon as possible to discuss the German question. In accordance with the will of the people of all countries, this conference must resolve the German question and eliminate the danger caused by the revival of German militarism and its collusion with American imperialism."

Romanian newspapers also published the full text of the Soviet note on the front page under large headlines. "Spark" said: The German people and the people of all countries praise with great satisfaction the Soviet proposal to invite representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the four-power conference. The Romanian people are greatly concerned about the establishment of lasting peace in Europe and the democratic settlement of the German question, and they fully support the Soviet government's note on the German peace treaty. "Free Romania" pointed out: Stalin's wise policy of peaceful diplomacy, once again embodied in the new Soviet note, is the only correct policy that can ensure an early and peaceful resolution of the German question and maintain and consolidate peace in Europe and the world.

Czechoslovakia's "Truth Daily" pointed out that the Soviet note is very different from the notes and actions of the Western countries, and it reflects the Soviet government's efforts to resolve the German question on the basis of the Potsdam Agreement.

Bulgarian newspaper opinion also expressed warm support for the new Soviet note. "Fatherland Front" wrote: Our people are very satisfied with the Soviet's new note on the German peace treaty issue. We believe that this note is a document of great international significance, which provides the possibility of a peaceful and just solution to the German issue and the strengthening of peace in Europe and the world.

    东欧人民民主国家报刊支持苏联新建议
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十七日讯：苏联政府八月二十三日就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会受到德意志民主共和国舆论的热烈欢迎。
    柏林各民主报纸都在第一页全文刊载了苏联政府八月二十三日的照会，并纷纷发表评论。
    “新德意志”报社论指出，苏联政府的照会是苏联为了和平解决德国问题所采取的又一步骤。该报说：“苏联政府在最近的照会中提出了明确的、各方面都能接受的具体建议。谁要拒绝这个建议，谁就是不愿意解决德国问题，而是一心想要分裂德国，发动战争。”该报对苏联提出邀请德意志民主共和国和西德两方面的代表参加德国问题的谈判这一建议评论说：“很难找到一个德国人，他珍视德国人民的利益，而会不欢迎苏联这个建议。”该报号召全体德国人民团结一致，反对波恩的战争条约，争取在苏联建议的基础上解决德国问题。
    “柏林日报”尖锐地抨击强使德国人民接受侵略性的波恩单独“条约”的西方国家政府和波恩政府的态度，并强调指出：苏联政府八月二十三日的照会再度向德国人民证明了，在他们争取缔结和约和国家统一的斗争中，苏联是他们的最伟大的朋友。
    “论坛报”说：德国人民应该根据苏联照会所提出的建议，用实际行动和言论，向西方国家提出他们正义的要求。
    德意志民主共和国的人民团体之一，“纳粹受害者协会”中央委员会也发表声明，表示欢迎苏联新照会。声明说：苏联照会给了我们新的勇气和力量，使我们能更加精神百倍地对波恩战争“条约”进行斗争，为德国人民当前的主要任务——争取和平与团结而斗争。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据德意志通讯社讯：西德人民支持苏联政府八月二十三日就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会。
    德国共产党执行委员会于二十六日就苏联新照会发表声明，指出，德国人民目前的首要任务就是，在任何情况之下必须制止联邦议会批准“一般性条约”。议员们的责任应该是实行苏联照会中所提出的建议，并与德意志民主共和国的人民议会就准备举行全德选举问题取得谅解。我们最重要的任务是加速缔结一个和约，必须强迫联邦议会采取行动。声明号召：“德国同胞们，你们应该用各种方式来表达你们的意见，你们应该组织集会，应该派遣代表团到议会去，应该组织示威游行以及各种各样的群众性行动。借以表示人民要求和约和反对一般性战争条约的愿望。”声明并指出，最近有八百多万西德人民在民意投票中表示了要求立即缔结和约的愿望。社会党的党员们和工作人员们，也曾表示他们要求和约、举行全体选举和统一德国的愿望。这种愿望是符合苏联建议的，在这个基础之上，共产党与社会民主党能够团结在一起，为实现他们的共同要求而斗争。
    二十五日西德所有的报纸都以大字标题刊出了苏联的新照会。“波恩评论”报的标题是：“苏联人愿意立刻和平”，“斯图加特纪事报”的标题是：“莫斯科答复了：苏联人愿意至迟在十月里举行四国会议”。许多报纸要求对苏联照会进行彻底的研究。
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社讯：东欧各人民民主国家热烈拥护苏联政府八月二十三日就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会。
    波兰各报刊载了苏联政府八月二十三日的照会，并发表评论，表示支持苏联政府的新建议。“人民论坛报”说：苏联照会是苏联和平政策又一次显著的表示，这种政策的目的是确保欧洲和平和满足德国人民要求成立一个统一、独立与民主的德国的正当愿望。该报斥责西方国家加深德国的分裂，并把西德变成了进攻波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和苏联的军事跳板，以及在德国发动内战的基地。“华沙报”写道：“波兰舆论界热烈地欢迎苏联政府关于早日召开四国会议以讨论德国问题的建议。遵照各国人民的意志，这个会议必须解决德国问题，并消除由于德国军国主义的复活及其与美帝国主义的勾结而引起的危险。”
    罗马尼亚各报也在第一页以大字标题刊出了苏联照会全文。“火花报”说：德国人民和各国人民怀着极满意的心情赞扬苏联所提邀请德意志民主共和国与德意志联邦共和国代表参加四国会议的建议，罗马尼亚人民对于建立欧洲的持久和平和用民主方式解决德国问题抱着极大的关心，他们完全拥护苏联政府关于对德和约问题的照会。“自由罗马尼亚报”指出：再度体现在苏联新照会中的斯大林的英明的和平外交政策，是能够保证及早和平解决德国问题，维护与巩固欧洲及全世界和平的唯一正确的政策。
    捷克斯洛伐克“真理报”指出，苏联照会与西方国家的照会与行动迥然不同，它反映了苏联政府力求在波茨坦协定的基础上解决德国问题。
    保加利亚报纸舆论也对苏联新照会表示热烈支持。“祖国阵线报”写道：我国人民对于苏联关于对德和约问题的新照会感到非常满意。我们认为，这个照会是一个具有极大国际意义的文件，它提供了和平与公正地解决德国问题和加强欧洲与全世界和平的可能。
