To Comrades Yearning for the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital

Li Huanshan, Vice President of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital
Dai Zhengqi, Vice President of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital

Since the opening of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital in Beijing, we have received numerous letters daily. These letters come from cities and remote villages. Throughout the country, people express their enthusiastic congratulations on the hospital's establishment or make their own requests. These letters fully reveal the Chinese people's joyful and excited congratulations on the birth of this hospital. They also show our heartfelt welcome and gratitude for the achievements of Soviet medicine and the selfless assistance of the Soviet people and Soviet experts, as well as the boundless trust and expectations placed upon them. These letters are a very significant encouragement to us. All the working comrades in our hospital are working actively under this encouragement.

All the Soviet experts, led by President Prokharov, are handling each case and each problem prudently with a highly responsible revolutionary enthusiasm. In their socialist country, the Soviet Union, they used to work shorter hours each day. After coming to the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, they stipulated an eight-hour work system, but in reality, they have been working for ten hours almost every day since the hospital opened, sometimes even fifteen or twenty-four hours. Many experts came to work in the afternoon as soon as they arrived in Beijing, and some experts often used their nap or meal times for outpatient consultations. When serious patients arrive, they never delay for a minute and start diagnosis and treatment immediately. When the condition is dangerous, the president and experts even personally guard the patients until they are out of danger. Their attitude towards patients is also very kind and considerate. This working spirit, this spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism, of the medical workers cultivated and educated by the socialist country of the Soviet Union under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, has had a great influence and education on all the Chinese comrades in the hospital. All Chinese comrades have fully developed the advantages of Chinese medical workers, further studying the working attitude and style of Soviet experts, and learning the Soviet experts' selfless spirit of serving patients. Chinese and Soviet medical workers work together harmoniously in the hospital, working together to meet the aspirations and demands of the Chinese people and to eliminate the disaster of disease.

In the nearly two months since its opening, in addition to the regular work of the outpatient and inpatient departments, experts have made more than 60 outpatient consultations and five reports. More than 1,000 letters and specimens requesting answers from other places or personally sent have been received, and there have been many requests for visits and talks every day. The requirements are multifaceted. Many medical and health institutions and medical workers want to quickly understand and apply the advanced Soviet medical experience and working methods. Many comrades want to be told newer health knowledge so that they can be healthier and strive better for the construction of the motherland. Patients have even more demands: some ask about diagnosis, treatment, and the nature of medicines; some ask for treatment for chronic diseases or hopeless disabilities, such as late-stage cancers and hair loss; and some whose health has been damaged in the arduous revolutionary struggles or under the enemy's torture, also urgently request recovery. We receive more than 50 letters like this every day. In addition to the various requests for visits, talks, etc., in the case of extremely busy regular business, it is difficult for us to quickly satisfy or answer the comrades who are yearning for us.

In order to help comrades who are yearning for the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital to further understand this hospital, we would like to explain a few major issues here.

First of all, the organizational structure, working system, and medical style of this hospital are all based on the advanced experience of the socialist country of the Soviet Union as a guiding principle, and are stipulated according to the specific conditions of Chinese society. However, due to the short opening time, everything is in the trial and exploration period. The Chinese comrades in the hospital are also actively learning and cannot immediately become familiar with the advanced Soviet medical ideas and methods. In addition, the current hospital site is temporary and the place is small, and many facilities and measures cannot be fully established and implemented. Therefore, we cannot propose very mature experience at present. As for the issue of visits, when representative agencies want to visit, they must obtain the prior consent of the hospital. We are not preparing to receive visits and visits from individuals and smaller units for the time being.

Secondly, because there are too many letters from comrades requesting urgent answers, and the experts are very busy, and some letters are not written very specifically, we plan to summarize the same questions and answer them systematically in the newspaper, and answer individual special questions individually. Doing so may not fully meet the requirements of the comrades, but we believe that the comrades will understand.

Finally, regarding the procedures for seeking medical treatment. Because the current hospital site can only accommodate 80 beds and the outpatient quota is only 200 people, in order to take care of the overall situation, visitors must be introduced by the relevant authorities. For example, central government staff must obtain a letter of introduction from the Central Health Department's Health Office from the Beijing First, Second, Third, and Fourth Joint Outpatient Departments or Welfare Hospitals. Beijing citizens and municipal government staff must obtain a letter of introduction from the district health centers and municipal hospitals led by the Municipal Public Health Bureau. Soldiers in this city must obtain a letter of introduction from the Health Office directly under the General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission. Soldiers in major military regions must obtain a letter of introduction from the Medical Department of the Central Military Commission's Health Department. Staff and residents of other districts who come to seek medical treatment must obtain the consent and a letter of introduction from the health office of the agency designated by the Central Ministry of Health. Only those with the above procedures will be accepted, otherwise they will be invalid. We hope that comrades who seek medical treatment will pay attention to avoid futile trips.

In terms of outpatient service: when the initial consultation is full, you need to make an appointment. For follow-up visits, you must hold a follow-up appointment slip issued by the doctor. In terms of hospitalization, only those who are deemed necessary by the outpatient doctor can be admitted. Those requesting consultation must be contacted by each hospital through the organization, and patients or the original agency should not make appointments on their own. The hospital's neurology and pediatrics departments have opened. The tuberculosis department has been cancelled, and Soviet experts have gone to the Beijing Red Cross Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital to guide the work. Outpatient hours: registration is from 7:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily. Closing hours: surgery on Tuesday and Friday mornings, gynecology on Wednesday morning, skin and venereal diseases on Wednesday and Friday afternoons, otolaryngology on Thursday morning, dentistry on Thursday afternoon, neurology on Tuesday afternoon, Saturday afternoon and Sunday are not open. Visiting hours: Tuesday and Thursday afternoons from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., Sunday mornings from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., and afternoons from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Only one person can enter each time, and children under the age of 13 are not allowed to enter the ward. Outpatient and inpatient services are charged (detailed measures have been formulated).

In a hospital with such an important task, especially the Chinese comrades, we feel that our strength and experience are insufficient. We hope that comrades can offer us opinions and criticisms frequently with the enthusiasm to look forward to and care for us. We have the determination and confidence to cooperate closely with Soviet comrades under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party and the superiors, learn with an open mind, and strive to complete this important and glorious task.

### 写给热望于北京苏联红十字医院的同志们

    写给热望于北京苏联红十字医院的同志们
    北京苏联红十字医院副院长  李幻山  戴正启
    北京苏联红十字医院在北京开幕以来，每日都接到不少函件，这些函件来自都市，也来自辽远的乡村。在全国范围内，每日都有人向这个医院表示庆贺的热忱或提出自己的要求。在这些函件中充分流露出中国人民欢欣鼓舞地祝贺这个医院诞生的热烈情绪，同时也看出了我们对苏联医学上的成就和苏联人民、苏联专家无私援助的国际主义精神所表示的衷心欢迎和感激，以及所寄予的无限信任和期望。这些函件，对我们说是有着非常重大的鼓励意义的，我们医院中的全体工作同志，都在这一鼓励之下，积极地工作着。
    以甫罗哈洛夫院长为首的全体苏联专家们，都是以高度负责的革命热情领导全院同志审慎地处理着每一个病案和每一个问题。他们在社会主义国家的苏联每天工作的时间是较少的，来到北京苏联红十字医院以后便规定了八小时的工作制，而实际上自医院开幕以来几乎每天都是坚持着十小时的工作，有时甚至十五小时或二十四小时。很多专家刚到北京，下午便来上班，有的专家外出会诊时常常是利用午睡或吃饭时间。严重的患者到院时，他们从不耽搁一分钟，马上就动手诊治。病情危险时，院长和专家们甚至亲自守护着，一直到患者转危为安为止。他们对待病人的态度，也是非常的亲切体贴。斯大林同志所领导的社会主义国家苏联所培养与教育出来的医务工作者们的这种工作精神，这种革命人道主义的精神，给予全院的中国同志们以极大的影响与教育，所有中国同志们都充分发挥了中国医务工作者的优点，进一步学习苏联专家们的工作态度与作风，学习苏联专家的忘我地为病人服务的工作精神。中苏两国医务工作者在医院中水乳交融地在一起工作，共同为满足中国人民的热望与要求，为消灭疾病的灾难而努力着。
    开幕近两个月来，每天除了门诊和病房的经常工作外，专家们外出会诊六十余次，作了五次报告。外地寄来或亲自送来要求解答的函件及标本达一千余件，请求参观和谈话的也日有多起。要求是多方面的，有很多医药卫生机构及医务工作者要求能很快了解并运用苏联先进的医学经验和工作方法；很多同志要求告诉他们以更新的卫生知识，使自己身体更健康，更好地为祖国建设而奋斗。病者的要求更多：有的询问诊断、疗法和药物性质；有的要求医治慢性疾病或无望的残疾，如后期的癌瘤和脱发等；还有一部分是在艰苦的革命斗争中或敌人的酷刑下损坏了健康的，也迫切地要求复原。像这样的来信，每天就有五十封以上，加上各方面所提出来的如参观、谈话等多种多样的要求，在经常业务极端忙碌的情况中，我们很难使热望于我们的同志们迅速地得到满足或解答。
    为了帮助热望于北京苏联红十字医院的同志们进
    一步了解这个医院，这里提出几个主要问题加以说明。
    首先，这个医院的组织机构、工作制度与医疗作风等，都是以社会主义国家苏联的先进经验作为指导原则，根据中国社会的具体情况来规定的。但是由于开幕时间很短，一切都在试行与摸索期间，医院中的中国同志们也正在积极学习，不能即时熟习苏联的先进医学思想与方法，加之现在的院址是临时的，地方狭小，许多设备及措施不能全部建立及实行，因此目前还不能提出十分成熟的经验。至于参观的问题，有代表性的机关要参观时，须事先得到医院方面的同意，个人及较小单位的参观与访问，我们暂时不预备接待。
    其次，同志们所提出来的迫切要求解答的信件，因为数字太多，专家们非常忙，同时也有一些信件写得很不具体，所以我们准备把相同的问题综合起来系统地在报纸上作答复，个别特殊的问题个别答复。这样做可能不能完全满足同志们的要求，但我们相信同志们会予以谅解的。
    最后，关于求治的手续问题。因为目前的院址只能容纳八十张病床，门诊定额也只有二百人，为了照顾全面，来诊者必须经过有关机关的介绍。如中央机关工作人员必须至北京市第一、第二、第三、第四联合门诊部或福利医院开具中央卫生部机关卫生处的介绍信，北京市市民以及市级机关工作人员经由市公共卫生局领导的各区卫生所、市立医院开具介绍信，本市军人须至军委卫生部直属卫生处开具介绍信，各大军区军人由中央军委卫生部医疗处开具介绍信，外区机关工作人员及居民来诊治时须得到中央卫生部所指定的机关卫生处同意及开具介绍信，具备有上列手续的才予以接诊，否则无效，希望求治的同志们注意，以免往返徒劳。
    在门诊方面：初诊满额时就需要预约，复诊时须持有医师填发的复诊预约券诊病。住院方面须经门诊医师检查认为必要者始能收容。请求会诊者须由各医院经过组织接洽，病人或原机关请勿自行约请。本院神经科、小儿科已经开诊；结核科已取消，已有苏联专家去北京市红十字会结核防治院指导工作。门诊时间：挂号为每日上午七时半至十一时，下午二时至五时半。停诊时间：外科每星期二、五上午，妇科星期三上午，皮花科星期三、五下午，耳鼻科星期四上午，牙科星期四下午，神经科星期二下午，星期六下午和星期日不应诊。探病时间：星期二、四下午三时至五时，星期日上午十时至十二时，下午三时至五时，每次只能进入一人，十三岁以下儿童不得进入病房。门诊及住院一律收费（都订有详细办法）。
    在负有这样重大任务的医院中，尤其是中国同志，特别感到力量与经验的不足，希望同志们能本着热望与爱护我们的热忱，经常对我们提出意见与批评。我们有决心和信心在毛主席和中国共产党以及上级的正确领导下，和苏联同志密切合作，虚心学习，为完成这一重大、光荣的任务而奋斗。
