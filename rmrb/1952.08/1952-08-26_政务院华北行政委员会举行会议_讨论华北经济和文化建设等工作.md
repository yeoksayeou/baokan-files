Xinhua News Agency, August 24th. The first plenary meeting of the Government Administration Council's North China Administrative Committee was held from August 15th to 17th. The meeting was presided over by Director Liu Lantao. Deputy Directors Liu Xiufeng and Zhang Su, and committee members Wang Congwu, Ping Jiesan, Li Zheren, Zhou Shutao, Ulanhu, Zhang Pan, Shu Sheyu, Yang Xiufeng, Dong Qiwu, Dong Luan, Pan Changyou, Deng Chumin, Lai Ruoyu, Bo Yibo, and Han Zheli, among others, attended the meeting. Heads of the Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Committees of various provinces and cities in North China were also invited to attend.

At the meeting, the committee members listened to and discussed Director Liu Lantao's report on the work situation in North China and the main tasks for the future, Deputy Director Liu Xiufeng's report on several issues concerning the industrial production increase and thrift campaign in the North China region, and Deputy Director Zhang Su's report on the outline of the North China region's plan for eliminating illiteracy. The meeting also approved the draft of the North China Administrative Committee's provisional organizational regulations and the North China region's fiscal revenue and expenditure budget for 1952.

All committee members present unanimously agreed with the general principle of "going all out to develop industrial and agricultural production and extensively promoting material exchange to strengthen economic construction work" as the central task for the current period, as pointed out in Director Liu Lantao's report, as well as the arrangements for other tasks. Many committee members pointed out in their speeches that the patriotic production increase and thrift campaign carried out on the three fronts of industry, agriculture, and trade throughout the region has achieved considerable success, and the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of people has been further aroused, becoming a driving force for promoting various other tasks. Committee member Yang Xiufeng cited the work of summer grain collection and well-drilling for drought prevention in Hebei Province this year as examples, illustrating that the power of the masses is unlimited once they are mobilized, and the completion of various tasks generally exceeded the planned targets. He pointed out that as long as the leadership clearly grasps this key link, some tasks may seem very heavy from above, but they can be easily completed as long as the masses are mobilized. Some cadres in Hebei Province have been able to better understand this issue, because the masses in action have educated them and helped them begin to understand how to improve their work methods. The committee members and the heads of the Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Committees of various provinces and cities unanimously mentioned in their speeches that the mobilization of workers to formulate advanced production increase and thrift plans was a profound education for the conservative thinking of the leadership. The production increase and thrift plans in various places, after discussion by the masses, generally exceeded the planned targets, and many problems that the leadership thought were difficult to solve were resolved when they were brought to the masses.

Director Liu Lantao and Deputy Director Liu Xiufeng pointed out in their reports that the current industrial patriotic production increase and thrift campaign should not only comprehensively fulfill this year's national plan and production increase and thrift plan, but more importantly, focus on improving production management, improving labor organization, improving technology and product quality, establishing cost management and planned management, laying the foundation for economic accounting, and completely ending the transformation process of turning old enterprises into new enterprises, so that we can master systematic business management experience. At the same time, attention should be paid to solving problems such as safe production, improving quality, and promoting advanced production experience. The committee members present unanimously agreed, and based on their understanding of the situation, explained the importance of paying attention to these issues.

In terms of agricultural production, in addition to agreeing with the various requirements put forward in Director Liu Lantao's report, everyone believed that the mass appraisal campaign is a movement to promote advanced experience on the agricultural production front and is an important guarantee for increasing production, which must be vigorously promoted after the autumn harvest. Regarding the issue of the employment of surplus labor in rural areas, everyone unanimously agreed that labor should be organized into expanding agricultural reproduction according to different situations, and more ways should be found in areas such as canal construction, river management, well-drilling, afforestation, and intensive farming. At the same time, we should also try our best to absorb rural idle funds to appropriately develop handicrafts that are necessary for urban and rural people and cannot be replaced by urban industrial products. In addition, issues such as agricultural production cooperatives, rural credit, and the training of rural cadres were also discussed.

Regarding the work of material exchange, everyone believed that the leadership should first seriously disclose costs through the competition movement to eliminate the old work style in the business management of the state-owned trade and cooperative systems, improve the relationship between them, and further strengthen the supervision of cooperative members. Secondly, we should prepare for the material exchange conference after the autumn harvest as soon as possible and conduct serious investigations and research on the supply and demand relationship of commodities to overcome the blindness in material exchange.

When the meeting discussed the outline of the North China's plan for eliminating illiteracy, Committee member Shu Sheyu emphasized that literary and art workers, journalists, and painters must unite to cooperate with the task of eliminating illiteracy, and learn to write popular and easy-to-understand works for the masses. The attitude of "not being able to write without three thousand characters" must be resolutely changed. We must run newspapers and periodicals that farmers can understand. If we cannot run them for the time being, it would be good if major newspapers could attach a small sheet every week. In this way, the masses can know new things every day, which can consolidate the achievements of eliminating illiteracy. Committee member Dong Qiwu introduced the experience of the troops in promoting the quick literacy method and believed that the work of the consolidation stage should be highly valued. He pointed out that some difficulties in the consolidation work were caused by the shortcomings in the crash course in learning new characters. Therefore, during the crash course in learning new characters, we must conduct in-depth leadership and pay attention to the consolidation work.

In their speeches, the committee members also talked about issues such as national issues, the relationship between public and private sectors, and labor-capital relations, and put forward valuable opinions on how to deal with them specifically.

Director Liu Lantao made a summary of the meeting. He pointed out that the current patriotic production increase and thrift campaign, which combines industry, agriculture, and trade, is the first time in North China and has achieved preliminary results. In order to deepen the work in the future, Director Liu Lantao especially emphasized the need to strengthen specific organizational leadership and systematize the experience in the work. Secondly, he pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of private enterprises, give regular and specific guidance, so that they have a clear understanding of some principles and policies. As for the issues of working hours, wages, and welfare raised by workers in private enterprises in the "Five-Anti" movement, a large part has not yet been resolved. Liu Lantao pointed out that the Industrial Bureau, the Trade Union, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce must jointly formulate methods to give appropriate solutions. In addition, Director Liu Lantao made concise and clear instructions on rural production cooperatives, credit and savings work, financial work, democratic construction, and cadre issues. Regarding the leadership of future work, he particularly pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of ideological policies and fully trust the creativity of the masses. Among all staff members, it is necessary to clearly establish the concept that the interests of the country and the people come first, and to carry out work with caution and humility. In the work, we must give full play to the great potential of the broad masses of people, overcome various conservative ideas, strengthen planning, grasp the central link in the work, and be good at using typical experiences to guide the work and take our work a step forward.

    政务院华北行政委员会举行会议
    讨论华北经济和文化建设等工作
    【新华社二十四日讯】政务院华北行政委员会第一次全体委员会议于八月十五日至十七日举行。会议由刘澜涛主任主持。出席这次会议的有刘秀峰、张苏副主任，王从吾、平杰三、李哲人、周叔弢、乌兰夫、张磐石、舒舍予、杨秀峰、董其武、董鲁安、潘长有、邓初民、赖若愚、薄一波、韩哲一等十八位委员。并请华北各省市爱国增产节约竞赛运动委员会负责人列席。
    此次会议听取并讨论了刘澜涛主任关于华北工作情况和今后几项主要工作的报告，刘秀峰副主任关于华北全区工业增产节约竞赛运动的几个问题的报告，张苏副主任关于华北区扫除文盲工作计划纲要的报告。通过了华北行政委员会试行组织条例草案和华北区一九五二年度财政收支预算。
    到会各委员一致同意刘澜涛主任报告中所指出的：“全力发展工业和农业生产，广泛促进物资交流以加强经济建设工作”为当前中心任务的总方针及其他各项工作的安排。多数委员在发言中均指出全区在工业、农业、贸易三条战线上所开展的爱国增产节约竞赛运动，已获得相当成就，广大人民的劳动热情进一步被发动起来，已成为推动其他各种工作的动力。杨秀峰委员以河北省今年的夏征、打井防旱等工作为例，说明群众发动起来后力量是不可限量的，各项工作完成情况一般均超过预定计划。他指出：只要领导上清醒地抓紧这一环节，有些任务从上边看确是很重，但只要发动起群众来就容易完成。河北省有些干部已能较好地理解这个问题，因为行动起来的群众教育他们开始懂得怎样改进自己的工作方法。各委员和各省市爱国增产节约竞赛运动委员会的负责人的发言中一致提到在发动工人制订先进的增产节约计划中对领导上的保守思想是一次极深刻的教育。各地的增产节约计划经过群众讨论普遍地超过了预定指标，许多领导上认为不好解决的问题放到群众中去就解决了。
    刘澜涛主任、刘秀峰副主任在报告中指出：当前的工业爱国增产节约竞赛运动不仅要全面完成今年的国家计划和增产节约计划，更重要的是集中在改进生产管理，改善劳动组织，提高技术和产品质量，建立成本管理，计划管理，打下经济核算制的基础，彻底结束将旧企业转变为新企业的改造过程，使我们能够掌握系统的经营管理的经验。同时，注意解决安全生产、提高质量及推广先进生产经验等问题。到会委员表示一致同意，依据自己了解的情况，说明重视这些问题的重要性。
    农业生产方面，大家除同意刘澜涛主任报告中所提的各项要求外，认为群众性的评比运动就是农业生产战线上推广先进经验的运动，是增产的重要保证，秋后还须大力推行。关于农村剩余劳力的出路问题，大家一致认为应依据不同情况把劳力组织到扩大农业再生产方面去，要在修渠、治河、打井、造林、精耕细作等方面多想办法。与此同时，还应尽可能吸收乡村游资适当的发展城乡人民所必需而又为城市工业品所不能代替的手工业。此外对农业生产合作社、农村信贷、整训农村干部等问题，也进行了讨论。
    关于物资交流工作，大家认为领导上目前首先应通过竞赛运动，认真公开成本，以肃清国营贸易和合作社系统经营管理上的旧作风，改善相互间的关系，进一步加强社员对合作社的监督。其次应及早准备秋收后的物资交流大会，认真进行商品供求关系的调查研究工作，以克服物资交流中的盲目性。
    会议讨论到华北扫除文盲工作计划纲要时，舒舍予委员强调提出文艺工作者、新闻记者、画家均须一致起来配合扫除文盲任务，学习写通俗的群众易懂的作品，“非三千字不能下笔”的态度必须坚决改变。要办农民能看懂的报刊，一时办不起来，大报每周能附出一小张也好。这样可以使群众天天知道新东西，可以巩固扫除文盲的成绩。董其武委员介绍了部队推行速成识字法的经验，认为应十分重视巩固阶段的工作，他指出巩固工作的某些困难是由于突击生字时有缺点带来的，因此在突击生字时，必须深入领导，注意巩固工作。
    各委员的发言中还谈到民族问题、公私关系、劳资关系等各方面的问题，并提出了如何具体处理的宝贵意见。
    会议由刘澜涛主任作总结，他指出当前的工业、农业和贸易三方面互相结合的爱国增产节约竞赛运动，在华北还是第一次，现已获得初步成就。为了使今后工作深入一步，刘澜涛主任特别强调要加强具体的组织领导工作，并把工作中的经验加以系统化。其次，他指出必须加强对私营企业的领导，给予经常而具体的指导，使他们对一些方针、政策有明确的认识，至于私营企业工人在“五反”中提出的工时、工资、福利问题，很大一部分尚未得到解决，刘澜涛指出必须由工业局、工会、工商联共同拟出办法，给以适当解决。此外，关于农村生产合作社、信贷储蓄工作、财政工作、民主建设和干部问题，刘澜涛主任都做了扼要而明确的指示。他对今后工作的领导问题，特别指出要加强思想政策的领导，要充分相信群众的创造力。在全体工作人员中，要明确树立国家和人民利益第一的观念，要谨慎谦虚地进行工作。在工作中，要充分发挥广大人民的伟大潜力，克服各种保守思想，加强计划性，抓取工作中的中心环节，善于运用典型经验去指导工作，把我们的工作向前推进一步。
