    Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editor's Note: We are now publishing below a summary of the responses from various relevant parties to the criticisms and suggestions from readers of the People's Daily.

    ▲ The Agricultural and Forestry Departments of Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces sent letters accepting the suggestion of reader Yang Weide (original suggestion published in the "Letters to the Editor" column on July 16). The Agricultural and Forestry Department of Chahar Province stated in its letter: They had already discovered that the masses in some areas of the province were using incorrect methods for pruning branches, but they did not pay attention to this issue at the time. Now they have notified governments at all levels to publicize the correct pruning methods to the masses in order to correct the phenomenon of excessive branch cutting and damage to trees in the past. The Agricultural and Forestry Department of Suiyuan Province stated in its letter that they had also paid attention to this issue in the past; on July 12th of this year, they also decided to strengthen education on tree planting and protection among the masses during the forest protection work conference. Recently, they also plan to instruct various localities to pay special attention to this issue again.
    ▲ The Mudanjiang Municipal People's Government accepted the suggestion of reader He Zhengping (original suggestion published in the "Letters to the Editor" column on July 16). The stinky puddle in the southern district of the city has existed for a long time. After liberation, the Municipal People's Government began to fill it with cinder, dust, and other materials; however, because the puddle is very large, it has not been filled up in the past few years. Now the city is vigorously repairing the drainage sluice gates of the river embankment and has decided to mobilize cadres from government offices to dig ditches during the autumn voluntary labor day to drain the accumulated water in the puddle. In addition, it is also prepared to continue filling it with cinder and other materials, with a plan to bring its height level with the city streets within five years.
    ▲ The office of the Central People's Government's Committee for Economy and Austerity Inspection sent a letter stating that reader Shi Ying's suggestion regarding "various organizations should properly handle the spoils recovered during the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements" (original suggestion published in the "Letters to the Editor" column on July 23) demonstrated a responsible attitude towards state property and should be commended. They are now drafting measures for the handling of recovered spoils. Once the handling measures are determined, all the seized spoils will be fully processed.
    ▲ After Comrade Shan Jinrong's suggestion on improving the arrangement of Chinese typewriter fonts (original suggestion published in the "Letters to the Editor" column on July 23) was published, many readers sent letters supporting this suggestion. The seven typing schools in Beijing, Yanjing, Shucai, Peiying, Kun'guang, Huiru, Shucheng, and Yaohua, jointly sent a letter stating that in mid-April, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, they formed a font improvement group to study the work of reforming the fonts. They hope to get help from relevant departments and comrades who work in typing, so that the fonts can be reformed to better meet practical needs. Some readers have also put forward specific plans for improving the arrangement of fonts, which we have all forwarded to the Central Technical Administration for research and handling.
    ▲ The Labor and Wage Department of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications accepted the opinion of the Labor and Wage Section of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau (original opinion published in the "Letters to the Editor" column on August 9), and reviewed the mistake of "emphasizing unified methods in the past without taking into account special circumstances." Now the department has notified the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau to formulate measures for adjusting overtime pay.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    编者按：今将各有关方面对人民日报读者批评建议的反应摘要发表于后。
    ▲察哈尔、绥远两省农林厅来信接受读者杨维德的建议（原建议刊七月十六日“来信摘要”栏）。察哈尔省农林厅来信称：他们早已发现该省某些地区的群众用错误的办法修枝，但当时没有重视这个问题。现在他们已通报各级政府，向群众宣传正确的修枝方法，以纠正过去修枝时砍枝过多破坏林木的现象。绥远省农林厅来信称，他们在过去亦曾注意了这个问题；今年七月十二日在护林工作会议中又决定对群众加强植树护林的教育。最近，他们并拟再指示各地特别注意这个问题。
    ▲牡丹江市人民政府接受读者何正平的建议（原建议刊七月十六日“来信摘要”栏）。该市南区的臭水泡子由来已久，解放后，市人民政府即开始用炉灰、尘土等物填堵；但因水泡子很大，几年来还没填平。现在该市正大力修复江堤的排水闸，并决定动员机关干部在秋季义务劳动日中挖掘水渠，以便排除水泡子内的积水。此外，还准备继续用炉灰等物填堵，计划在五年内使它的高度可以和市内街道相平。
    ▲中央人民政府节约检查委员会办公室来信，认为读者史瑛关于“各机关应妥善处理‘三反’‘五反’运动中收回的赃物”的建议（原建议刊七月二十三日“来信摘要”栏），表现了对国家财产的负责精神，应该加以表扬。他们现在正在拟订关于追缴赃物的处理办法。待处理办法确定后，即可将缴回的赃物全部处理。
    ▲单锦蓉同志关于改进华文打字机字盘排列方法的建议（原建议刊七月二十三日“来信摘要”栏）发表后，很多读者来信支持这个建议。北京市燕京、树材、培英、坤光、慧如、树成、耀华七个打字学校联名来信说，他们七个学校在四月中旬由北京市文教局领导组成字盘改进小组，研究改革字盘的工作。他们希望得到有关部门和作打字工作的同志的帮助，以便把字盘改革得更切合实际需要。有些读者还提出了改进字盘排列方法的具体方案，我们都已转请中央技术管理局研究处理。
    ▲中央人民政府邮电部劳动工资处接受北京电信局劳动工资科的意见（原意见刊八月九日“来信摘要”栏），检讨了“过去强调统一办法，没有照顾特殊情况”的错误。现在该处已通知北京电信局拟具调整加班费的办法。
