    The Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an Agricultural Mutual Aid and Cooperation Work Conference from May 30th to June 6th to smoothly carry out the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Comrade Xi Zhongxun, at the preparatory meeting convened the day before the conference, emphasized that the land reform in the four provinces within the customs of the Northwest region has been basically completed, and Xinjiang will also be completed next year. In areas where land reform has been completed, the feudal landlord economy has been destroyed, and the development of a new democratic economy by organizing individual farmers has become the main trend in the development of the rural economy. Organizing individual farmers gradually into collective production through the mutual aid and cooperation movement has become the focus of rural work after the land reform, and all work should be adapted to this new situation and make new deployments. Therefore, Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out that this conference is of historical and great significance, and its task is to arouse the party's attention to this work ideologically, and to determine how to implement the Central Committee's policy based on the actual situation in the Northwest, and to formulate specific implementation plans for various places. Judging from the results of this conference, it has completed this task and is a successful conference.

    The conference first listened to the report by Comrade Cai Ziwei, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northwest Region, on the "Development of the Agricultural Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement in the Northwest Region and Future Opinions." Comrades from various places reported on the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in their respective regions, experiences and lessons, problems, and future opinions. The conference conducted relatively planned and prepared enthusiastic discussions on the above issues. Comrade Xing Yi of the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government also introduced the situation and problems of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in various parts of the country. Finally, Comrade Xi Zhongxun made a concluding report, determining the plan, steps, and guidelines for future development.

    The conference not only reflected the various situations, typical experiences, and various problems of the mutual aid and cooperation movement itself in a relatively in-depth and systematic manner, but also reflected the situation and problems of various aspects of rural work after land reform in a more comprehensive manner. As Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out: The current situation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Northwest can be summarized as rapid development, many problems, great impact, and weak leadership. This conference conducted heated discussions on these situations, experiences, and problems.

    The conference determined the plan, steps, and guidelines for the future development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Northwest: Under the principle of "mass development and steady improvement," first, universally and massively develop small-scale temporary seasonal mutual aid teams, consolidate permanent and fixed mutual aid teams, and focus on the trial operation of agricultural production cooperatives, striving to organize 60% to 70% of the labor force in agricultural population areas throughout the region within two or three years, and to trial-operate one to two agricultural production cooperatives in each county. To guide farmers to organize, all types of mutual aid and cooperation organizations should strive to produce more grain. Second, there should be correct methods for calculating work points and accounts. Third, the outlet for surplus labor should be resolved; it should mainly be invested in land processing and increasing sideline production.

    In order to achieve the above objectives, Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out: All rural work, such as finance, trade, health, cooperation, culture, public security, and democratic construction, should be carried out around the development of agricultural production and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out: The decisive link at present lies in strengthening the party's leadership and strengthening the ideological understanding of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. To this end, the whole party should study documents related to mutual aid and cooperation once to improve our leadership level. Further strengthen the party's work in rural areas, so that party members become the leading core of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. All rural party members and Youth League members should participate in mutual aid teams and play an active exemplary role. At the same time, labor models should be cultivated in a planned manner, and the party organization should be expanded step by step, and strive to complete the above tasks.

    西北局召开农业互助合作工作会议
    确定西北地区互助合作运动发展的计划、步骤和方针
    中共中央西北局为了顺利开展农村互助合作运动，特于五月三十日至六月六日召开了农业互助合作工作会议。习仲勋同志在会议前一天所召集的预备会上，强调指出：西北地区关内四省的土地改革已基本完成，新疆也将于明年完成。在土地改革已经完成的地区，封建的地主经济已经摧毁，个体农民组织起来发展生产的新民主主义经济就成了农村经济发展的主要趋势。把个体农民逐渐组织起来集体生产的互助合作运动已成为土地改革后农村工作的重点，一切工作也应适应这一新的形势而加以新的部署。因此习仲勋同志指出这次会议是具有历史性的重大意义的，它的任务是从思想上引起全党对这一工作的重视，并根据西北的实际情况确定如何贯彻中央的方针，订出各地具体施行的计划。根据这次会议的结果来看，它完成了这一任务，是一个成功的会议。
    会议首先听取了西北农林部部长蔡子伟同志关于“西北区农业互助合作运动发展情况和今后的意见”的报告，各地的同志汇报了本地区互助合作运动发展情况，经验教训，问题和今后意见，会议就以以上问题进行了比较有计划有准备的热烈讨论，中央人民政府农业部互助合作司邢毅同志并介绍了全国各地互助合作运动的情况和问题，最后由习仲勋同志作总结报告，确定了今后发展的计划、步骤和方针。
    会议不只是比较深入比较系统地反映了互助合作运动本身的各种情况、典型经验和各种问题，而且也比较全面地反映了土地改革以后农村工作各方面的情况和问题。正如习仲勋同志所指出的：西北目前的互助合作运动的情况，概括说来就是，发展很快、问题很多、影响很大、领导很弱。这次会议对这些情况、经验和问题都进行了热烈的讨论。
    会议确定了今后西北互助合作运动发展的计划、步骤和方针：在贯彻“大量发展、稳步提高”的方针下，首先普遍地大量地发展小型的临时季节性的互助组，巩固常年定型的互助组，重点试办农业生产合作社，争取两三年内，在全区农业人口地区把百分之六十至七十的劳动力组织起来，每县试办一至两三个农业生产合作社。要引导农民组织起来，首先要求各种类型的互助合作组织，努力争取多打粮食。其次应该有正确的计工算账的方法。第三要解决剩余劳力的出路；主要应投入土地加工；增加副业生产。
    为了达到上述目的，习仲勋同志指出：农村中一切工作，如金融、贸易、卫生、合作、文化、治安、民主建政等都应围绕发展农业生产、发展互助合作运动进行。
    习仲勋同志指出：目前决定的环节在于加强党的领导，加强对互助合作运动的思想认识。为此，全党都应学习一次有关互助合作的文件，提高我们的领导水平。进一步加强农村党的工作，使党员成为互助合作运动的领导核心，所有农村党员、团员都要参加互助组，起积极的模范作用。同时应有计划地培养劳动模范，有步骤地扩大党的组织，为完成上述任务而奋斗。
