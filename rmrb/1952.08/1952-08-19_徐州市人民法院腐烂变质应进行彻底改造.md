Must Thoroughly Reform Judicial Work

    The Corrupt and Degenerate Xuzhou People's Court Must Be Thoroughly Reformed

    In the great "Three-Anti" struggle, the Xuzhou People's Court exposed serious impurities in its politics, organization, and ideology. Most of the staff of the Xuzhou People's Court were old judicial personnel who had been retained. Most of the cadres newly assigned after liberation were also bad elements with impure components, unclear histories, and vile characters, who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. The former president, Wang Jingwu, had long been involved in Chiang Kai-shek's army, and later concealed his landlord background and criminal history to infiltrate the revolutionary camp and the Communist Party organization (he has been expelled from the Party and detained). The former director of the Civil Affairs Office, Yang Zhongxuan, was a former Kuomintang judicial officer captured by us during the Kuomintang's anti-communist war in 1941. The former deputy director of the Criminal Affairs Office, Feng Ziao, had served as a puppet army officer and bandit battalion commander, and infiltrated the revolutionary camp after being captured in 1941, sneaking into the Communist Party organization as a probationary member. In addition, there were three people who were expelled from the Party, two who wavered or defected, and two who were given probation within the Party or warnings. After these people were assigned to the People's Court, they colluded with the bad elements among the old judicial personnel and committed all kinds of evil deeds together. For the past three years, they have been guilty of corruption, perversion of justice, sheltering counter-revolutionaries, raping women, sheltering illegal capitalist elements, and making wrong judgments, which has completely corrupted and degenerated the Xuzhou People's Court.

    Corruption, Perversion of Justice, and Sheltering of Counter-Revolutionaries

    Among all the personnel of the Xuzhou People's Court, about 30% were involved in serious corruption. The former president, Wang Jingwu, accepted bribes and sheltered counter-revolutionaries as many as eleven times, and protected drug traffickers eight times. For example, the traitor Song Chaoquan led the reactionary "Ganzi Society" to cooperate with the Japanese invaders in attacking our Canal Detachment at Julang Bridge, killing our director of the Political Department, pistol captain, guard company commander, and 29 other commanders and fighters. His crime was heinous. However, Wang Jingwu, in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, only sentenced Song Chaoquan to seven years in prison because he accepted bribes. The former director of the Civil Affairs Office, Yang Zhongxuan, was guilty of corruption and perversion of justice as many as 42 times. The former deputy director of the Criminal Affairs Office, Feng Ziao, was also guilty of corruption and perversion of justice more than ten times. The former director of the Labor Reform Camp, Zhang Lindong (who has been detained), accepted bribes and allowed prisoners to live at home, and even asked them to go out and do business. When superiors came to inspect, the labor camp would send people to find the prisoners and bring them back to deal with the inspection. As a result, more than ten habitual bandits, financial criminals, and drug traffickers escaped; some criminals even made a fortune while in prison.

    Raping Women, Running Amok

    Four cadres and five bailiffs of the Xuzhou People's Court have raped women. As many as 22 women were raped. Zhang Xinghe, a retained personnel, even went to the home of a released female prisoner and used threats to commit rape. In addition, some people molested and insulted female parties involved in divorce cases and family members of prisoners. The phenomenon of abusing power and running amok was even more widespread. The former director of the Labor Reform Camp, Zhang Lindong, had more than 30 prisoners beat Zhang Lianhua, a prisoner who had been caught after escaping. Zhang Lianhua vomited blood from the beating and died soon after. When the nanny hired by judge Li Xusheng's family wanted to resign, his wife refused. Li Xusheng then wrote a complaint himself, acted as the judge himself, and had his wife act as the plaintiff, imprisoning both the nanny and the nanny's sister. A leading cadre of the court heard a female prisoner singing in the prison, and ordered the bailiffs to tie up 36 female prisoners in the prison with wires overnight.

    Sheltering Illegal Capitalist Elements

    The Criminal Affairs Office of the Xuzhou People's Court handled dozens of cases of illegal capitalist elements abusing and injuring apprentices. They sentenced the illegal capitalist elements to a maximum of only six months in prison with a one-year reprieve. After the illegal capitalist elements injured the apprentices and were sued in court, they said smugly, "At most, I'll stay in the court for two days, it doesn't matter." Li Jingui, the owner of a workshop, injured the right middle finger of his apprentice Li Zifa, which had festered, but still forced him to work. Li Zifa's injury became more and more serious, and he had to have surgery to amputate his middle finger, spending two dan of wheat for medical expenses. However, Li Jingui only paid a small amount of medical expenses and refused to let Li Zifa work in the shop again. In the spring of 1951, the shop was short of staff and had a lot of work, so Li Zifa was brought back. Soon, Li Zifa was again injured in the waist and face by Li Jingui with a wooden stick. The injury was so serious that it took more than a month to recover. Tang Yaozhen, an old judicial officer of the Xuzhou People's Court, only sentenced Li Jingui to six months in prison with a one-year reprieve when he tried this case, and did not ask about the execution of the sentence after the verdict was announced.

    Failure to Investigate and Research, Wrong Judgments

    Many staff members of the Xuzhou People's Court made judgments based solely on subjective assumptions when hearing cases, resulting in wrong judgments and the false accusation of good people. For example, the Xuzhou Cotton Weaving Industry Association lost more than 20 million yuan of association funds and suspected that the accountant Zai Linan had committed theft. The Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Zai Linan and transferred him to the court. Li Xusheng, who was handling the case in the court, did not investigate and research, and sentenced Zai Linan to fifteen years in prison without reporting it for review according to the procedures. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the real thief was discovered, but Zai Linan had been detained for a year. They were equally irresponsible in dealing with death penalty cases. For example, in October 1950, the murderer Ding Daosong falsely accused Wang Shixun of plotting to make money and kill him because he had a private feud with Wang Shixun. The person handling this case in the Xuzhou People's Court only sentenced Wang Shixun to death along with Ding Daosong based on Ding's one-sided confession. Fortunately, the Provincial People's Court sent it back for retrial during the review, and the truth was clarified after investigation. In August 1951, a peddler, Pan Youyin, was accused of stealing 130,000 yuan. The person in charge of the court did not ask in detail, and ordered Pan Youyin to hand over the original lost money in full, and filed the case. But after the case was closed, Pan Youyin was detained again for no reason and was not interrogated for three months. When Pan Youyin questioned, the court realized that the case had been closed, and there was neither a detention warrant nor a withdrawal warrant in the file. In the Xuzhou People's Court, there are many similar phenomena of illegal and derelict wrong judgments. There were more than 20 such cases handled by Feng Ziao, the former deputy director of the Criminal Affairs Office. More seriously, this situation continued to occur even after the "Three-Anti" movement.

    The crimes of these bad elements in the Xuzhou People's Court, such as corruption, perversion of justice, violation of laws and regulations, loss of position, and reckless judgments, have caused inestimable losses to the Party and the People's Government politically, and aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. In this judicial reform movement, the Xuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Government should resolutely rely on the masses to thoroughly transform this court, cleanse the bad elements, and eliminate the reactionary old legal views and old yamen style.

### 徐州市人民法院腐烂变质应进行彻底改造

专栏：必须彻底改革司法工作

    徐州市人民法院腐烂变质应进行彻底改造
    在伟大的“三反”斗争中，徐州市人民法院暴露了在政治上、组织上、思想作风上严重的不纯现象。徐州市人民法院工作人员大部分是留用的旧司法人员。解放后新配备的干部，也多数是成分不纯、历史不清、品质恶劣、混入革命队伍的坏分子。前院长王景武，曾长期在蒋匪军中混事，以后又隐瞒其地主成分和罪恶历史，混入革命阵营和共产党组织（已被开除党籍并加以扣押）。前民事处处长杨仲轩是一九四一年国民党发动反共战争中被我俘掳的国民党旧司法人员。前刑事处副处长冯子鏖曾当过伪军官、土匪营长，一九四一年被俘后混入革命阵营，并钻入共产党组织为候补党员。此外还有被开除党籍的三人，动摇或叛变脱党的二人，受留党察看和警告处分的二人。这些人被配备到人民法院后，就跟旧司法人员中的恶劣分子互相勾结，共同为非作歹。三年来，他们贪赃枉法、包庇反革命分子，强奸妇女，包庇不法资产阶级分子，错乱判案，已使徐州市人民法院完全腐烂变质。
    贪赃枉法，包庇反革命分子
    徐州市人民法院全部人员中，贪污情节严重、性质恶劣的约有十分之三。前院长王景武贪赃受贿后包庇反革命分子达十一次；包庇贩毒犯八次。如汉奸宋朝权曾率领反动的“杆子会”配合日寇在聚粮桥进攻我运河支队，杀害我政治部主任、手枪队长、警卫连长，以及其他指挥员、战斗员二十九人，罪大恶极。但王景武在镇压反革命运动中，因接受贿赂，仅判宋朝权徒刑七年。前民事处处长杨仲轩贪赃枉法达四十二次。前刑事处副处长冯子鏖贪赃枉法也达十多次。前劳教所所长张临东（已被扣押）贪污受贿，纵放犯人在家里居住，甚至还叫犯人出去做生意。上级去检查时，劳教所即派人到各处把犯人找回来支应一下。因而惯匪、金融犯、贩毒犯逃跑了十多人；有的犯人在监禁期中还发了财。
    强奸妇女，胡作非为
    徐州市人民法院有四个干部和五个法警都强奸过妇女。被奸污的妇女达二十二人。留用人员张兴河竟到被开释的女犯人家里，用威胁手段实行强奸。此外还有些人玩弄、侮辱过离婚案的女当事人和犯人家属。滥用职权、胡作非为的现象更为普遍。前劳教所所长张临东曾让三十多个犯人殴打逃跑后被捉回的犯人张连华，张连华被打得吐血，不久即死去。审判员李旭升家里雇用的褓姆要辞职，他的妻子不愿意，李旭升就自撰诉状，又自当审判员，叫他的妻子当原告，把褓姆和褓姆的姐姐一齐关押起来。该院一个领导干部听到一个女犯人在监所内唱戏，就令法警用电线把在监所的三十六个女犯人捆绑了一夜。
    包庇不法资产阶级分子
    徐州市人民法院刑事处曾处理不法资产阶级分子虐待、伤害学徒的案件数十件。他们对于不法资产阶级分子最多只判了半年徒刑，一年缓刑。不法资产阶级分子在打伤了学徒、被告到法院后，竟洋洋得意地说：“顶多蹲两天法院，没有关系。”某作坊老板李金桂把学徒李子法的右手中指打伤，已经溃烂，仍强迫其劳动。李子法伤势日重，不得不动手术把中指锯掉，用去小麦二石作医药费。但李金桂只负担少许医药费，并拒绝李子法再入店工作。一九五一年春，该店人少事多，又把李子法找回。不久李子法又被李金桂用木棍打伤腰部和脸部，伤势甚重，一个多月才养好。徐州市人民法院旧司法人员唐尧忱审理这一案件时，却只判处李金桂徒刑半年，并缓刑一年，宣判后也不过问执行的情况。
    不调查研究，错乱判案
    徐州市人民法院许多工作人员在审理案件时，单凭主观臆断判案，因此错判乱判，冤枉好人的事件层出不穷。例如徐州市棉织业公会遗失会款两千多万元，怀疑会计宰立南有窃盗行为，由市公安局把宰立南逮捕转送法院。法院承办这件案子的李旭升不调查研究，就判宰立南十五年徒刑，并不按手续呈报复核。这次“三反”、“五反”运动中，真正窃款人被发现了，但宰立南已被拘押了一年之久。对待判处死刑案件，他们也同样不负责任。如一九五○年十月，杀人犯丁道松因和王世训有私仇，诬咬王世训和他共同图财害命。徐州市人民法院承办这件案子的人仅根据丁犯片面口供，把王世训和丁道松同样判处死刑。幸经省人民法院复核时发回更审，经调查后才把真象弄清。一九五一年八月间，小贩潘有银被控告偷款十三万元。法院承办人未加详细询问，即令潘有银照数交出原先失款，把卷宗归档结案。但结案后潘有银又无故被扣押起来，三个月不审讯。潘有银提出质问时，法院才发觉案已结，卷内既无押票，又无提票。在徐州市人民法院，类似以上的违法失职错乱判案的现象很多。仅前刑事处副处长冯子鏖处理的案件中就有二十多起。更严重的，是这种情况直到“三反”运动以后还继续发生。
    徐州市人民法院这些恶劣分子贪赃枉法、违法乱纪、丧失立场、胡乱判案等危害人民的罪行，给党和人民政府在政治上造成不可估计的损失，引起群众极大不满。中共徐州市委和市人民政府在这次司法改革运动中，应坚决依靠群众，彻底改造这个法院，清洗坏分子，肃清反动的旧法观点和旧衙门作风。
