    Near Stalingrad
    I. Gandarov, Chief Engineer of Main Electrical Design, Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station
    Stalin Prize Winner
    On August 31, 1950, the Soviet Council of Ministers announced the decision to build the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station. This hydroelectric station is the second grand hydroelectric station after the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River.
    The Soviet government's decision pointed out the task of this great construction project: to fundamentally improve the climatic conditions of the Caspian lowland and eliminate the hot winds that damage crops along the Volga River.
    Utilizing the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station to irrigate 13 million hectares of desert and semi-desert land in the lower reaches of the Volga River will change the climatic conditions in these areas. Through irrigation systems, the arid grasslands will receive a constant flow of river water from the Stalingrad Reservoir, transforming them into lush wheat and cotton fields, pastures, and hayfields with stable and abundant harvests. Afforestation and irrigation, like water diversion, will completely change the economic and natural geographical conditions of the lower reaches of the Volga River and the Caspian coast, rapidly developing the region's productive forces.
    The hydroelectric station of the Stalingrad Hydropower Hub will supply electricity to the central region of the European part of the Soviet Union, the Volga region, and the central black earth zone. The power generation capacity of the hydroelectric station will be at least 1.7 million kilowatts, with an annual power generation of 10 billion kilowatt-hours in years with normal water levels.
    The cheap electricity from the Stalingrad and Kuibyshev, as well as a series of other hydroelectric and thermal power plants, will enable all sectors of industry and agriculture in the vast area from Moscow to the lower reaches of the Volga River to achieve unprecedented development.
    The construction of the Stalingrad Hydropower Hub is fundamentally improving navigation conditions in the lower reaches of the Volga River—a waterway that has always been very difficult due to shallow water, especially in arid years. Upstream from Stalingrad, the hydropower hub has created deep-water river areas over a long distance. The huge reservoir supplies the Volga River region below Stalingrad with an even water volume and provides the necessary depth of water for passenger and freight transport in the area.
    The Stalingrad Hydropower Hub makes it possible to build new railway and automobile river crossings across the Volga River without the need for special bridges. This will also promote the development of areas adjacent to the hydropower hub.
    Therefore, as a result of the construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, all the most important national economic problems of this vast area will be solved. The construction of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad Hydroelectric Stations on the Volga River, the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station on the Dnieper River, and the construction of the South Ukraine and North Crimea Canal, the Turkmen Main Canal, as well as the opening of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, all signify the beginning of a new era—an era of great hydraulic engineering construction projects, an era of creating the material and technical foundation of communism within the Soviet Union.
    The Stalingrad Hydropower Hub separates the Volga River upstream of Stalingrad, where the riverbed is divided into two branches by islands, with the right branch being the main stream. All reinforced concrete hydroelectric station construction projects are located on the left bank of half of the riverbed. Navigable locks, the overflow section of the dam, and the buildings of the hydroelectric station are distributed here. The construction of these main construction projects of the hydroelectric station does not involve the right bank branch of the river. Therefore, navigation through the Volga River will not be hindered in any way during the construction of the Stalingrad Hydropower Station. In the final stage of construction, when the construction project on the left bank of the river area is about to be completed, the dam will separate half of the riverbed on the right bank. A similar method was used in the autumn of 1951 when blocking the Don River bed for the construction of the Tsimlyansk Hydropower Hub.
    The scale of construction of the Stalingrad Hydropower Hub is many times larger than that of the project on the Don River. If the amount of earthwork in the construction of the Tsimlyansk Hydropower Hub was 76 million cubic meters, then in the construction of the Stalingrad Hydropower Hub, not including the irrigation system and the Volga-Ural Canal, it would be no less than 110 million cubic meters. 1.9 million cubic meters of cement and reinforced concrete were laid in the Tsimlyansk Hydropower Hub, but in the Stalingrad Hydropower Hub, the amount of cement and reinforced concrete work is more than 6 million cubic meters, more than twice as much.
    Construction work on the construction site of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station began in 1951. In the past year, basic auxiliary and preparatory work has been carried out, huge geological survey work has been completed, railway sidings have been laid, power transmission devices have been installed, and factories and motor vehicle yards for repairing machinery have been established.
    Last year, the Soviet state paid particularly great attention to the construction of housing and cultural institutions for the staff of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station. In the Soviet Union, builders receive care and attention from all sides. This year, hundreds of thousands of square meters of new housing will be built again for the builders of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station. The staff of the great construction project will receive well-equipped housing, many schools, hospitals, etc.
    This spring, the basic construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station has begun, and it is proceeding at a particularly high speed.
    Part of the huge repair-technical factory has started operation, which will repair excavators, bulldozers, and rock drills used in the construction project. The first cement mixing plant will soon start operation. The construction of the asphalt factory will be completed, and the sites for the buildings of two mechanized cement factories will be selected and prepared. These factories will be transported here from the Cossack towns of Tsimlyansk through the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. The construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station will have a huge and powerful cement factory. This factory will supply builders with no less than 16,000 cubic meters of cement every day during peak work periods.
    The construction work of the hydropower hub itself is expanding on a large scale. The foundation pit of the hydropower hub is protected by dams from the flow of the Volga River and the Akhtuba River.
    The builders blocked the Volga River and the Akhtuba River with dams. However, the Akhtuba River still provides water to the orchards and vegetable gardens along its banks. To this end, a 6-kilometer-long canal will be built south of the future hydropower hub, and the Akhtuba River will be connected to the Volga River in a new place.
    The excavation of the Volga-Ural navigable canal has already begun. It is 600 kilometers long and will connect the Volga River and the Ural River. Many powerful excavators are excavating day and night on this canal route.
    A working model of the hydropower hub was built in Stalingrad, which is called the "small Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station." This model expresses a 20-kilometer section of the Volga River bed with great accuracy, its very complex relief of the river bottom and banks. The model of the hydropower hub installed on this artificial river is one hundred and fiftieth of the actual size, and scientists have relied on the help of the model to carry out huge survey work.
    Only by widely using the latest Soviet technology in the construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station can it be possible to realize the construction of such a grand hydropower hub as the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station in a short period of time.
    There will be more machines and machinery near Stalingrad than during the work on the Lenin Volga-Don Canal.
    In addition to 300 cubic meter and 500 cubic meter suction dredgers, there will be suction dredgers working here that can excavate 1,000 cubic meters of soil per hour.
    Excavators, bulldozers, rock drills, and tractors released from the construction of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, after major repairs, have been lined up in large teams and are heading to the site of the great communist construction project, including the construction project of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station. Some of the construction personnel of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal have also come to the construction site of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station one after another. The workers of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, who have accumulated huge and rich experience in the construction of the firstborn of the great communist construction project, will demonstrate creative and highly productive labor in the construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station.
    In another four years, accurately within the time limit set by the Soviet government, the construction project of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station will definitely be completed. It is a huge step for the Soviet people in building the material and technical foundation of communism with fiery enthusiasm.

    在斯大林格勒近郊
    斯大林格勒水电站主要电力设计图案总工程师
    斯大林奖金获得者  伊·冈达洛夫
    一九五○年八月三十一日，苏联部长会议公布了关于建设斯大林格勒水电站的决定。这个水电站是次于伏尔加河古比雪夫水电站的第二个宏大的水电站。
    在苏联政府的决定中曾经指出这个伟大建设工程的任务：根本改善里海沿岸低地的气候条件，消灭侵害伏尔加河沿岸农作物的热风。
    利用斯大林格勒水电站，对伏尔加河下游一千三百万公顷的沙漠和半沙漠土地实行灌溉，将改变这些地方的气候条件。干旱草原可以通过灌溉系统，从斯大林格勒水库中得到川流不息的河水，从而把草原变成茂盛的麦田和棉田，变成牧场和具有稳固性丰收的刈草场。造林和灌溉、引水一样将使伏尔加河下游和里海沿岸的经济的、自然地理的条件完全改变，使该地区的生产力迅速发展起来。
    斯大林格勒水力枢纽的水电站，将把电力供给苏联欧洲部分中央地方、伏尔加河沿岸和中央—黑土地带。水电站的发电能力至少为一百七十万瓩，在水位正常的年份的发电量为一百亿瓩时。
    斯大林格勒和古比雪夫以及其他一系列的水力发电站和火力发电站的廉价电力，将使从莫斯科到伏尔加河下游广大地区的工农业所有部门获得空前发展。
    斯大林格勒水力枢纽站的建设，在根本上改善着伏尔加河下游的航行条件——这条航路由于水浅，特别在亢旱年月里，一向感到非常困难。从斯大林格勒溯流而上，水力枢纽站在很长的距离间，建立了深水的河流地区。巨大的水库供给斯大林格勒以下的伏尔加河地区以均等的水量，并为该地区的客货航运供应了必需的深度水量。
    斯大林格勒水力枢纽站使得建造横渡伏尔加河的新的铁路和汽车渡河点成为可能，而不需要建设特别的桥梁。这也将促进毗连水力枢纽站地区的发展。
    因此，由于建设斯大林格勒水电站的结果，就解决了这一广大地区全部的最重要的国民经济问题。伏尔加河上古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站的建设，第聂泊河上卡霍夫卡水电站及南乌克兰与北克里米亚运河、土库曼大运河的建设，以及列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的开航，都意味着新时代的开始——伟大水力技术建设工程的时代，在苏联境内创建共产主义的物质—技术基础的时代的开始。
    斯大林格勒水力枢纽站把伏尔加河在斯大林格勒上游地方隔开，在那里，河床被岛屿分成两条支流，其中右边的一条支流是主流。所有钢骨水泥的水电站建设工程都配置在左岸的河床的一半地方。在这里分布着通航水闸，堤坝的溢水路部分和水电站的建筑物。在建设水电站这些主要建设工程时，是不牵涉河的右岸支流的。因此，在建设斯大林格勒水力发电站时，通过伏尔加河的航行不会受到任何困难。在建设的最后阶段，即当左岸河流地区建设工程将要完成的时候，堤坝就要把右岸河床的一半隔开。当一九五一年秋为建设齐姆良水力枢纽站而遮挡顿河河床的时候，曾使用过类似的方法。
    建设斯大林格勒水力枢纽站的工程规模要比顿河上的工程规模大许多倍。如果说，在齐姆良水力枢纽站的建设上挖土工作数量为七千六百万立方公尺，那末，在斯大林格勒水力枢纽站的建设上，不算灌溉系统和伏尔加河—乌拉尔河运河，就不下于一亿一千万立方公尺。在齐姆良水力枢纽站曾铺设水泥及钢骨水泥一百九十万立方公尺，可是在斯大林格勒水力枢纽站，水泥及钢骨水泥的工作数量则是六百万立方公尺以上，多了两倍多。
    斯大林格勒水电站建筑现场上的建筑工作是一九五一年开始的。在去年间，曾进行了基本的补助和准备工作，完成了巨大的地质勘察工作，敷设了铁路专用线，装设了送电装置，建立了修理机械的工厂及汽车场。
    去年，苏维埃国家对建筑斯大林格勒水电站工作人员的住宅及文化机关的建设，给予特别巨大的注意。在苏联，建设者受到各方面的关怀和注意。今年，为了斯大林格勒水电站的建设者，将再建筑数十万平方公尺面积的新住宅。伟大建设工程的工作人员将得到附有设备齐全的住宅，许多所学校，医院等。
    今年春季，在斯大林格勒水电站上已开始基本建设，它正以特别的高速度进行着。
    巨大的修理—技术工厂一部分已开工，它将修理在建设工程上使用的掘土机、铲土机、攻坚凿地机。第一个混合水泥工厂，即将开工。沥青工厂的建设将告竣工，并为两所机械化的水泥大工厂的建筑物择好和准备妥当场所。这些工厂将由齐姆良的哥萨克村镇中经过列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河运到这里来。斯大林格勒水电站的建设将拥有巨大威力的水泥工厂。这个工厂在工作紧张时，将供给建设者每天不下于一万六千立方公尺的水泥。
    水力枢纽站本身的建设工作正在大规模地扩展着。水力枢纽站的基坑周围，用堤坝防护着伏尔加河及阿赫都布河的水流。
    建设者用堤坝把伏尔加河和阿赫都布河截断。可是阿赫都布河仍旧供给位于它沿岸的果园和菜园以水源。为此，在未来的水力枢纽站以南将修筑六公里长的运河，而在新的地方把阿赫都布河和伏尔加河联结起来。
    伏尔加河—乌拉尔河通航运河的开凿已经开始。它长达六百公里，将把伏尔加河和乌拉尔河联结起来。许多强大的掘土机，在这条运河路线上正日日夜夜不息地开凿着。
    在斯大林格勒修建了水力枢纽站的活动模型，它被称为“小型的斯大林格勒水力发电站”。这个模型以非常的正确性表达出伏尔加河河床二十公里的部分，它的河底和河岸的十分复杂的浮雕。在这条人工的河上装置的水力枢纽站的模型为实际尺寸的一百五十分之一，科学家们依靠该模型的帮助进行了巨大的勘察工作。
    只有在斯大林格勒水电站建设上广泛使用最新的苏联技术，才有可能在短时期内实现像斯大林格勒水电站这样宏大水力枢纽的建设。
    在斯大林格勒近郊的机器和机械将比在列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的工作还要多。
    除三百立方公尺的及五百立方公尺的吸土机以外，这里将有一小时可以掘出一千立方公尺泥土生产力的吸土机来工作。
    由建设列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河腾出来的掘土机、铲土机、攻坚凿地机、拖拉机，经过大修理后，已排成整列大队向共产主义伟大建设工程现场驶去，其中也包括斯大林格勒水电站的建设工程在内。列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的一部分建设人员，也陆续到斯大林格勒水电站建设现场来。在共产主义伟大建设工程初生儿的建设上积累了巨大而丰富的经验的列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河工作者们，将在建设斯大林格勒水电站上表现创造性的、高度生产效能的劳动。
    再过四年，准确地在苏联政府所规定的期限内，斯大林格勒水电站的建设工程定将完工。它是苏联人民以如火如荼的热情在建设共产主义的物质—技术基础上的巨大步伐。
