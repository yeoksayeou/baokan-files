    Congratulatory Letter to the Wounded and Sick Soldiers and Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers

    To the Comrades of the Wounded and Sick Soldiers and Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    On the occasion of the nationwide warm celebration of the 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, we extend our highest respect and cordial greetings to you—the glorious comrades of all wounded and sick soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers. At the same time, we also extend our condolences to the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers.

    Dear comrades of the wounded and sick soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers: You have fought heroically for the liberation cause of the Chinese people and for the defense of the security of the motherland and world peace, sparing no effort to shed your precious blood and sacrifice your health. Your noble behavior and noble qualities have aroused the infinite respect of the people all over the country and all peace-loving people in the world. The people of the whole country know that the great victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution, the great victory achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front, and the vigorous development and achievements of our country's various construction undertakings are inseparable from your heroic struggle and glorious achievements.

    Today, as we commemorate "August 1st," the American aggressors are still continuing to drag out the armistice negotiations in Korea and carry out a series of crazy provocations. After conducting bacteriological warfare against the Chinese and Korean people in violation of humanitarianism and international law, they recently bombed the Yalu River Shuifeng Power Plant and the peaceful city of Pyongyang, which are closely related to the peaceful life of the Chinese and Korean people, and continuously invaded our Northeast with aircraft, strafing and killing our peaceful residents. All these bloody facts clearly prove that the American aggressors have not abandoned their conspiracy to expand the war of aggression, which has aroused greater anger among the people of China and the world and has been unanimously condemned by the people of the world with justice.

    The American aggressors vainly attempt to use these provocative means to intimidate the Chinese and Korean people into submission, but they have not achieved their goal in the past, and they will never achieve their goal in the future. We Chinese people, together with the Korean people and the people of the world, have full confidence and sufficient strength to smash all the provocative actions of the American imperialists. At present, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the people of the whole country are carrying out a large-scale movement to increase production and practice economy, and are striving to further strengthen the country's economic construction. There is no doubt that with the progress of economic construction, our national defense strength will also be greatly enhanced. We must support the just struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with greater strength in order to win the final victory of the Korean anti-aggression war and a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue.

    Dear wounded and sick comrades, I hope you will recuperate with peace of mind and regain your health as soon as possible so that you can return to the fighting posts. Dear revolutionary disabled soldiers, I hope you will study hard, strive for progress, and always maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers, and actively participate in various construction work of the motherland as far as your physical condition permits. This is your glorious duty to the motherland. We believe that you, with your excellent revolutionary traditions, will certainly fulfill your glorious duty.

    中国人民抗美援朝总会
    给伤病员和革命残废军人的慰问信
    中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军伤病员和革命残废军人同志们：
    在全国人民热烈庆祝“八一”建军节二十五周年的今天，我们特向你们——光荣的全体伤病员及革命残废军人同志们致崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问，同时，并向革命烈士家属和革命军人家属致慰问之意。
    亲爱的伤病员和革命残废军人同志们：你们为了中国人民的解放事业，为了保卫祖国的安全与世界和平而英勇奋斗，不惜洒出自己宝贵的鲜血，牺牲自己的健康。你们这种崇高的行为和高贵的品质，引起了全国及全世界一切爱好和平的人民无限的崇敬。全国人民都晓得：中国人民大革命的伟大胜利，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线所获得的伟大胜利，以及我们国家各种建设事业所获得的蓬勃发展与成就，都是和你们英勇奋斗和光辉的功绩分不开的。
    在今天纪念“八一”的时候，美国侵略者仍然在朝鲜继续拖延停战谈判，并实行一连串的疯狂挑衅，在违反人道和国际公法对中朝人民进行细菌战之后，最近竟又滥肆轰炸和中朝人民和平生活有密切关系的鸭绿江水丰发电厂与和平城市平壤，并不断以飞机侵入我国东北，扫射、杀害我国和平居民。这一切血腥的事实，清楚地证明美国侵略者仍未放弃其企图扩大侵略战争的阴谋，已引起了全中国以及全世界人民更大的愤怒，受到全世界人民一致的正义声讨与谴责。
    美国侵略者妄想用这些挑衅手段威吓中朝人民屈服，但是他们过去既未达到目的，今后也是绝对达不到目的的。我们中国人民与朝鲜人民和全世界人民一道，有充分的信心，同时也有充足的力量，粉碎美帝国主义者的一切挑衅行动。现在全国人民正在“三反”、“五反”运动胜利的基础上，开展大规模的增产节约运动，为进一步加强国家经济建设而努力。毫无疑问，随着经济建设的进展，我们的国防力量也将大大增强。我们要以更大的力量支持中国人民志愿军的正义斗争，以争取朝鲜反侵略战争的最后胜利和朝鲜问题的公平合理解决。
    亲爱的伤病员同志们，希望你们静心疗养，早日恢复健康，以便重新走上战斗的岗位。亲爱的革命残废军人同志们，希望你们努力学习，力求进步，永远保持和发扬革命军人的光荣传统，在身体可能条件下，积极参加祖国各种建设工作。这是你们对祖国应尽的光荣职责。我们相信，有着优良的革命传统的你们，是一定会尽自己的光荣职责的。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会
    八月一日
