　　Along the winding trenches, I went to the front-line positions. Passing through two mountains in between, the area was not far from the front line, and the ground was covered with bullet marks. The first mountain was quite steep, and by the time I reached the summit, my clothes were soaked with sweat. From behind came a warm greeting: "Comrade, take a break and have some water before you go!" A soldier wearing a clean white apron and a beaming smile walked towards me with a bowl of boiled water. It was like seeing a spring in the desert, and I gulped down two bowls in one breath. Then, I took off my shirt to cool off in the breeze. The cook who brought me the boiled water looked at my sweaty bare back and said loudly, "Don't take it all off, be careful of catching a cold." His words were full of sincere concern. I accepted his advice, put on my clothes, lit a cigarette, and also handed him one, casually asking, "What unit are you with?" "Ninth Company." This company was not unfamiliar to me. I remembered that the director of the regiment's political department had once introduced to me that the Ninth Company was the best company in the entire regiment in terms of hygiene work, and had not had a single serious illness case in thirteen months.

　　The cook who brought me the boiled water was cooking, the firewood crackling loudly, and a fragrant smell of pea pods wafted from the pot. I asked, "How much do pea pods cost per pound?" The cook said proudly, "Didn't cost a penny, we grew them ourselves." The soldiers being able to eat the fresh vegetables they grew themselves would greatly improve the nutrition of the troops. After speaking, the cook placed the cleaver and spoon in an orderly manner in a tin box, covered with gauze. The place near the stove where dirty water was dumped was a pentagonal covered drain made of stone slabs. The dirty water was discharged underground, which did not attract flies or produce odors, truly hygienic and clean. I couldn't help but praise, "You are very particular, the hygiene work is done very well!"

　　The cook's eyes gleamed, and he said modestly, "We are far behind the platoons!" He introduced to me, "The hygiene work of the Third Platoon is the best in our company. The political instructor praised them the day before yesterday. In twenty days, they killed more than fifty thousand flies, captured more than a hundred rats, and there is not a single blade of grass within a hundred meters of the garrison..." This aroused my interest even more, and I decided to go to the Third Platoon first.

　　The Third Platoon leader had previously worked in the communications squad of the regimental headquarters. He was not tall but very sturdy. He recognized me, saluted me when we met, and we warmly shook hands. He inquired about the visit of the returning representatives to the motherland. After talking for a few sentences, I paused and asked him, "Are you doing well now?"

　　The Third Platoon leader's ruddy face revealed a smile, saying, "Thanks to Chairman Mao, since we came to the position, we have food to eat, clothes to wear, things to use, and no illnesses or disasters, everything is fine." Then he led me into their dugout. I had been away from the Korean front for almost half a year, and everything had changed, everything was moving forward on the road to victory. One could enter the dugout without having to lower their head, facing a slogan: "Do a Good Job in Hygiene Work, Smash Germ Warfare." Inside were two caves, the inner cave was used for sleeping and resting, deep underground; the other was an outer room, also called a club, also called a reception room, for meetings and study. A window opened in the upper left, and strong sunlight shone directly inside, bringing dryness and fresh air to the cave. The walls were plastered with paper. The ground was swept clean, and white insecticide powder was sprinkled in the corners, and it was almost impossible to see an ant. Seven or eight fly swatters made of cardboard were hanging on the wall, with several lines of words written on them: "Oppose germ warfare, let Truman perish with flies and mosquitoes." I stared blankly, probably the Third Platoon leader guessed what I meant, he pointed to a hill in the front left and said to me: "This spring, when the ground was covered with white snow, a large pile of flies was found on this hill; later, when we were building fortifications, we found three dead rats. The American devils wanted to use flies and rats to save their military failure, and attempted to poison us with bacteriological weapons. Since then, everyone has been mobilized to participate in hygiene work and fight against germ warfare." Then, a look of pride appeared on his face and he said: "Now, everyone has turned hygiene work into a system, and hygiene system into a habit of life." He introduced in detail the hygiene work of the troops on the position -- although the troops lived on the hilltop, and in the tense environment on the front line, everyone tried their best to keep the environment and utensils of the residence clean. The whole company launched the "Five Cleans, Three Kills" campaign (clean ground, clean bowls, clean chopsticks, clean basins, clean tables and chairs; kill flies, kill mice, kill mosquitoes), everyone generally bathed once a week, washed their feet twice a week, washed their shirts every three days, and aired their bedding every two days; washed their hands before meals; and ensured that they drank boiled water twice a day... The Third Platoon leader said: "In this way, our dugout can be considered a place where flies and insects have no place to stand!"

　　I immediately gave a thumbs up and said: "You really have a way, you have smashed the American devils' germ warfare."

　　The Third Platoon leader smiled, and said modestly: "We can achieve this result because of the help of the higher authorities and the people. The people of the motherland have sent us many effective medicines, and the higher authorities have formulated many good methods for us, which have promoted our hygiene work." Yes, the Third Platoon leader is right, we are smashing the germ warfare conspiracy of the American devils on the Korean front line. In addition to the efforts of the soldiers, it is mainly due to the support of the people of the motherland and the guidance of the higher authorities. Let me convey the achievements of hygiene work on the front line and the comrades' gratitude to the people of the motherland to the people of the whole country, and let us continue to work together to thoroughly smash the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism!

    这里没有苍蝇、蚊子站脚的地方
    ——记朝鲜前线阵地上一个连队的卫生工作
  　夏光
    沿着蜿蜒曲折的交通壕，我到前沿阵地去。中间通过两座山，这里离战线不远，遍地有弹痕。第一座山相当陡，爬到山顶，浑身衣衫被汗湿透了。在背后传出一声亲切的招呼：“同志，歇一歇，喝点水再走吧！”一位身着洁白围襟，笑容可掬的战士，舀了一碗开水向我走来。这好比沙漠里望见了泉水，我骨嘟骨嘟一口气喝了两碗。随着，我把上衣脱光在风头上取凉。给我送开水的炊事员望着我滴汗的赤膊，大声地说：“不要脱光，当心凉着受感冒。”话里充满了诚恳的关怀。我接受了他的意见，披上衣服，点着一支烟，同时也递给他一支，顺便问道：“你是那部分的？”“九连。”这个连并不陌生，我记得：团政治部主任曾经向我介绍过，九连是全团卫生工作最好的一个连队，十三个月来没有发生过一个重病号。
    给我送开水的炊事员正在煮菜，柴火烧得劈剥地响着，锅上冒着腾腾的热气，一股豆荚的香味扑鼻吹来。我问道：“豆荚多少钱一斤呀？”炊事员得意地说：“一个钱也没花，咱们自己种的。”战士们能够吃上自己种植的新鲜菜蔬了，这对部队营养将有莫大的改善。炊事员说完话，将菜刀和勺子有规则地放在一只洋铁箱子里，上面罩着纱布。锅台附近倒脏水的地方是用石片砌成的一个五角形暗沟口，脏水从地下排出去，不招苍蝇，又不生臭味，真是又卫生又干净。我不禁赞佩说：“你们真讲究，卫生工作做得真好！”
    炊事员两眼闪着光，谦逊地说：“我们跟班里比，还差老啦！”他向我介绍：“咱们连的卫生工作数三排最好，前天指导员还表扬了他们。他们在二十来天打死了五万多个蝇子，捕捉了一百多只老鼠，驻地一百公尺内找不到一根碎草叶……”这更引起了我的兴趣，我决定先到三排去。
    三排排长早先在团部通讯班工作过，个子不高，长得很结实。他认识我，见面就向我行了个礼，我们亲热地握住了手。他关切地问起我们归国代表访问祖国的情况。谈了几句，我转了口气问他：“现在你们很好吧？”
    三排长红润的脸孔露出笑容，说：“托毛主席的福，咱们打上阵地以来，有吃的，有穿的，有用的，又没病没灾，一切都挺好。”随即把我引进他们的隐蔽部，离开朝鲜前线快半年了，眼前的一切都变了样，一切都向着胜利的道路上前进着。隐蔽部用不着低头，就可以进去，迎面贴着一条标语：“做好卫生工作，粉碎细菌战”。里面有两个洞子，里边洞子是睡觉休息用的，深入地下；另一个是外间，也叫俱乐部，也叫会客室，供平时开会学习用的。左上方开着一个窗子，强烈的阳光直射到里面，并给洞里带来了干燥和清新的空气。墙上糊着纸。地扫得净光光的，墙角撒着白色的杀虫粉，简直见不到一个蚂蚁。壁上挂着七八个用硬纸做成的苍蝇拍，上面写着几行字：“反对细菌战，让杜鲁门和苍蝇、蚊子一起完蛋。”我出神地望着，大概三排长猜到了我的意思，他指着左前方一个山头对我说：“今年春天，遍地铺着白雪的时候，这个山头却发现一大堆苍蝇；后来我们做工事时又发现三只死老鼠。美国鬼子想用苍蝇、老鼠来挽救军事上的失败，企图用细菌武器来毒害我们。自打那以后，大家都动员起来参加卫生工作，跟细菌战展开斗争。”接着，他脸上流露出自豪的表情说：“现在，大家都把卫生工作变成制度，把卫生制度变成生活习惯了。”他详细地介绍部队在阵地上的卫生工作——部队虽然住在山头上，而且处在战线上的紧张环境里，大家都尽最大的力量保持了住地环境和用具的清洁，全连展开了“五净、三打”运动（地净、碗净、筷净、盆子净、桌椅净；打苍蝇、打耗子、打蚊子），大家普遍做到一星期洗一次澡，两天洗一次脚，三天洗一次衬衣，两天晒一次被服；做到饭前必须洗手；保证每天喝上两次开水……三排长说：“这样一来，咱们隐蔽部算没有苍蝇、虫子站脚的地方了！”
    我当时竖起大拇指说：“你们真有办法，算把美国鬼子的细菌战粉碎了。”
    三排长笑了笑，谦虚地说：“我们能取得这个成绩，是由于上级和人民的帮助。祖国人民给我们送来了许多有效的药品，上级给我们订出了许多好办法，推动我们搞好了卫生工作。”是的，三排长的话是对的，我们在朝鲜前线粉碎美国鬼子的细菌战阴谋，除战士们的努力外，主要是由于祖国人民的支援和上级的指导。让我将前线上卫生工作的成绩和同志们感谢祖国人民的心意转达全国人民，我们共同继续努力，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战而斗争吧！
