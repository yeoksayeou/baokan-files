Our Country's Recognition of the Geneva Conventions and Protocols Further Consolidates World Peace
Professor Chen Tiqiang, Tsinghua University

On July 13th, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government, issued two important statements: one statement recognized the four conventions signed in Geneva on August 12, 1949, in the name of China, namely, the "Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field," the "Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea," the "Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War," and the "Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War"; the other statement recognized the "Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare," signed in Geneva on June 17, 1925, to which China acceded on August 7, 1929, in the name of China. These international agreements were all signed by the Kuomintang reactionary government in the name of China. Article 55 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China shall examine all treaties and agreements concluded between the Kuomintang government and foreign governments, and shall recognize, abrogate, revise, or renegotiate them according to their content." After reviewing the above-mentioned Geneva Conventions and the Geneva Protocol, our Central People's Government believes that the content of each convention and protocol "is fundamentally conducive to lasting international peace and in accordance with humanitarian principles." The recognition of these conventions once again demonstrates the efforts of our government and people for the cause of peace and the sincerity of their love for peace. It more concretely demonstrates the high degree of principle and justice of our country's foreign policy.

Although the current four Geneva Conventions were signed in 1949, their history can be traced back to the second half of the 19th century. The Prisoner of War Convention replaced the 1929 Geneva Convention, which in turn evolved from the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions on the Laws and Customs of War on Land. The predecessor of the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field was the Geneva Convention, which was revised three times in 1864, 1906, and 1929. The Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea was derived from the Hague Convention No. 10 of 1907. The Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is a new convention, but its principles can be found in the third section of the Hague Convention on the Laws and Customs of War on Land.

Since the 18th century, with the intensification of competition among capitalist countries, the scale of wars has expanded, and the cruelty of wars has become even more shocking; at the same time, humanitarianism has gradually risen in human thought, and upright public opinion has demanded the abolition of war, or at least the limitation of its destructiveness. At that time, the rulers of European countries had to make some concessions to humanitarianism under the pressure of the people. The Geneva Conference of 1864 and the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907 were concrete manifestations of these concessions. These conferences adopted a series of conventions and declarations, codifying certain existing customs that reduced the harm of war and formulating rules to address specific issues. These conventions and declarations can be summarized into the following basic principles: (1) In war, harming the enemy is only a means of subduing the enemy, not an end in itself. Therefore, the means of harming the enemy are not unlimited, and all harm and destruction that is not militarily necessary should be prohibited; (2) Certain types of weapons and methods of warfare (such as dumdum bullets, poison gas, etc.) are considered to violate humanity and are prohibited from use; (3) Improve the treatment of prisoners of war and wounded and sick personnel, and reduce their suffering; (4) Respect the lives and property of civilians and prohibit direct attacks on them.

It is obvious that the Hague Conventions, the Geneva Conventions, and similar international treaties and customs will not be automatically observed by imperialist countries. Because the ruling groups of imperialist countries are keen on war, they do not hesitate to use inhumane means of warfare to pursue the interests of aggression. Therefore, imperialist countries will not be enthusiastic about complying with these rules, except for their own convenience or out of concern for retaliation from the other side. During the First and Second World Wars, imperialist countries violated the laws of war, especially during the Second World War, when Nazi Germany and fascist Japan unscrupulously violated these international rules. The atrocities of the Hitler bandits in the territories of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries were appalling. They completely disregarded the provisions of international law and inflicted extremely cruel and inhumane treatment on Soviet prisoners of war. Reichardt, the head of the prisoner of war department of the German Army Headquarters, openly ordered the entire army not to grant Soviet prisoners of war the treatment stipulated by the Geneva Convention. Soviet prisoners of war could be shot at any time; no Soviet political personnel were spared. A letter from Nazi war criminal Rosenberg to war criminal Keitel revealed: Soviet prisoners of war "mostly starved or froze to death, and thousands of prisoners of war died of typhus... Many prisoner of war camps had no houses, and prisoners of war slept in the open air in rainy or snowy weather." After July 1943, many prisoners of war were used as test subjects for germ warfare, resulting in death. The Nazis carried out large-scale, planned massacres in the occupied territories, with the aim of eliminating races. Millions of civilians were killed in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The town of Lidice in Czechoslovakia was razed to the ground. As a result of the bloody massacres in Poland, one-third of the Polish population was killed! In the Far East, Japanese imperialism killed more than 10 million of our people. The Nanjing Massacre alone killed 300,000 men, women, and children. During the war, the Japanese invaders also carried out inhumane chemical and bacteriological warfare in various parts of China.

However, the Hitler bandits and Japanese fascist war criminals miscalculated the power of the world's people and the power of international law. Since the emergence of the Soviet Union, "international treaties" and "international law" that are conducive to international peace are no longer empty rhetoric for the imperialists to deceive themselves, but have become real laws with real sanctioning power. The Nazis and Japanese war criminals did not recognize this point and were finally subjected to just sanctions in Nuremberg, Tokyo, and Khabarovsk.

The Second World War proved that the old laws of war had many imperfections. In 1945, various governments and the Red Cross expressed the hope that the old Geneva Conventions would be revised. In April 1949, the Swiss government convened a diplomatic conference in Geneva, attended by sixty-three countries. The Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe sent representatives to participate and played a decisive role in the conference. As a result, the four conventions mentioned above were adopted. A total of sixty-one countries, including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, signed and participated in these conventions.

One of the important characteristics of the new convention is that it explicitly stipulates the "individual responsibility" principle of Nuremberg. According to past international law, violations of international law, if carried out in the execution of state policy or in compliance with orders from superiors, did not entail individual responsibility. Article 129 of the current Prisoner of War Convention (as well as Article 49 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Article 50 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, and Article 146 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War) stipulates: Contracting States shall enact legislation to "provide effective penal sanctions" for those who seriously violate this Convention; at the same time, "Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts." This means that a criminal who violates the convention is not only considered a criminal in the victimized country, but also in a third country, and the third country has the obligation to arrest and bring such person to justice.

The second characteristic of the new convention is that the convention applies not only to wars declared between two contracting states, but also to any other armed conflict, even if one of the countries does not recognize the existence of a state of war (Article 2 of each convention). Especially after the First World War, in order to evade the sanctions of international law, imperialist countries often avoided taking formal declarations of war when engaging in aggression. For example, the Japanese invaders' aggression against China was "undeclared war" until 1941. The United States' aggression against Korea was also undeclared and was shamelessly described as a "police action." The above-mentioned provisions of the new convention effectively blocked the opportunity for imperialists to exploit loopholes. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a declaration on July 13, 1950, stating that the Korean People's Army strictly abides by the principles of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. The US imperialists can no longer use the excuse of "not recognizing" the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or the excuse that the war was not declared, to deny their responsibility for violating international law.

Like Nazi Germany and fascist Japan, the US aggressors seriously violated international law in the Korean War. Disregarding all international obligations, they carried out bloody massacres, abuse, and trampling of prisoners of war and Korean peaceful residents. As far as the Prisoner of War Convention is concerned, the convention clearly stipulates that "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities" (Article 118), but the US robbers arrogantly demanded to detain a large number of our captured personnel . The convention stipulates that "In no circumstances may a prisoner of war renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to him by the present Convention" (Article 7), but the US robbers insisted on putting forward the absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation." The convention stipulates that prisoners of war shall be treated humanely, prohibiting any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of prisoners of war. The convention specifically points out that prisoners of war shall not be subjected to physical mutilation "or to medical or scientific experiments of any kind which are not justified by the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner concerned and carried out in his interest" (Article 13), but the US robbers carried out large-scale massacres of our unarmed captured personnel and used our captured personnel as test subjects for atomic bombs and bacteriological warfare. The convention stipulates that prisoners of war shall be "protected especially against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity" (Article 13), "Prisoners of war are entitled in all circumstances to respect for their persons and their honour" (Article 14), but the US robbers forced tattoos on our captured personnel and often subjected them to threats and insults.

The US aggressors brazenly violated the Geneva Conventions and related international laws, stubbornly and recklessly, thinking they had succeeded. They obviously had not learned enough lessons from the fate of Hitler and Tojo. They also did not fully realize that today, international agreements for the maintenance of peace and humanitarianism are no longer "scraps of paper." The peace camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world firmly stand behind these agreements and vow to be their backing. Foreign Minister Zhou's statement added the power of China's 500 million people to the side of defending the Geneva Conventions, greatly increasing the prestige of these treaties. This will undoubtedly have an extremely significant impact on the struggle to maintain international law and international peace around the world.

The Geneva Protocol has a more extensive historical background than the Geneva Conventions. Since breaking away from the most barbaric state, mankind has already abandoned the use of poisons or poisonous weapons as means of warfare. Bourgeois international law scholars unanimously acknowledge that this is one of the oldest international customary laws. The Hague Convention of 1899 incorporated this customary law into its provisions. Article 23 of the Laws and Customs of War on Land stipulates: "In addition to the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially forbidden: (a) To employ poison or poisoned weapons; ... (e) To employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering." The term "poison" here refers to all forms of poisonous substances, naturally including bacteria. The Hague Conference of 1899 also unanimously passed a declaration prohibiting the use of poison gas (only the United States attempted to oppose it at the time). Article 171 of the Treaty of Versailles stipulates that poison gas or similar substances "have been outlawed," and Germany shall not manufacture or import them. The US-German Treaty of 1921 recognized that this provision was also effective for the United States. Article 5 of the Washington Treaty of 1922 recognized that poison gas and similar substances "have been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilized world," and the contracting states agreed to prohibit their use (the treaty later failed to take effect because France was dissatisfied with the submarine clauses). In addition to reiterating the provisions of the Washington Treaty, the Geneva Protocol of 1925 announced that this prohibition would be extended to bacteriological weapons. The Geneva Protocol has been ratified by forty-two countries. Only six countries, namely the United States, Japan, Brazil, El Salvador, Uruguay, and Nicaragua, have not ratified it.

These facts prove as solid as iron that the prohibition of chemical and bacteriological weapons has long been part of international customary law. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers' Investigation Team also affirmed this in their "Report on US Crimes in Korea." Even if we take a step back and say that before the Geneva Protocol was established, this customary law was not clear enough or specific enough, then the establishment of the Geneva Protocol can be said to have completely made up for these shortcomings. And since the Geneva Protocol has been ratified by forty-two countries, this protocol itself constitutes a standard of international law. As Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council, said, "it is equally binding on the conscience and practical actions of all countries." From this point of view, the United States' attempt to oppose the Hague Declaration in 1899 and its refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol after 1925 were both in vain. Even if robbers curse the laws that punish robbers all day long, this will not diminish the binding force of such laws. The law will one day put chains on the heads of robbers.

People may ask: Since the international law prohibiting poison gas and bacteriological warfare already has legal effect, why does the United States still refuse to ratify the Geneva Protocol, and why does the Soviet Union still call on all countries to ratify it?

We know that the United States' refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol has its own tricks. When discussing the ratification of the protocol in 1925, the US government was already considering using this "cheap and effective" weapon in the future. Even as far back as 1899, the US representative to the Hague Conference had already bluntly stated that the United States was unwilling to abandon this "means that may be used advantageously in the future." Today, US militarists are not only considering or planning to use this weapon, but are actually already using it in Korea and Northeast China. The United States' attempt to escape responsibility for this heinous crime by using "not ratifying the Geneva Protocol" as an excuse is obviously futile.

The United States' unwillingness to ratify the Geneva Protocol precisely exposes its sinister intentions. The Soviet Union's call in the United Nations Security Council for the ratification of the Geneva Protocol was precisely aimed at this point. This call is like a demon-revealing mirror. No matter how varied the demon's transformations, it will be exposed in its true form under the light of this mirror. There are now two paths in front of the US aggressors: either formally recognize the illegality of using poison gas and bacteriological weapons, or refuse to ratify the protocol, thus nakedly revealing themselves to the people of the world as murderers who violate humanitarianism and undermine international law.

We Chinese people ardently love peace and oppose war, especially the use of weapons that massively slaughter civilians to wage war. China has suffered from the scourge of poison gas and bacteria from Japanese invaders in the past, and today it is suffering from bacterial attacks from the United States. We hate the imperialists' use of such unscrupulous weapons to the core. We realize that the bacterial bombs falling on our heads today may fall on the heads of other peace-loving people in the world tomorrow. Therefore, we are the first to respond to the Soviet Union's call and recognize the Geneva Protocol. We will use practical actions to support this protocol, resolutely stop bacteriological and poison gas warfare, and bring the bacteriological war criminals to justice and punish them according to law.

In short, Foreign Minister Zhou's two statements fully express the Chinese people's desire to love peace and uphold humanitarianism. We believe that peace can be achieved, and justice will ultimately prevail. Only in this way can international law be truly implemented.

    我国承认日内瓦各项公约和议定书进一步巩固了世界和平
    清华大学教授  陈体强
    七月十三日我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长发表了两项重要声明：一个声明承认一九四九年八月十二日在日内瓦以中国名义签字的四个公约，即“改善战地武装部队伤者病者境遇之公约”，“改善海上武装部队伤者病者及遇船难者境遇之公约”，“关于战俘待遇之公约”及“关于战时保护平民之公约”；另一个声明承认一九二九年八月七日以中国名义加入的一九二五年六月十七日在日内瓦订立的“关于禁用毒气或类似毒品及细菌方法作战议定书”。这几项国际协定都是国民党反动政府以中国名义所签订。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第五十五条曾明确规定：“对于国民党政府与外国政府所订立的各项条约和协定，中华人民共和国中央人民政府应加以审查，按其内容，分别予以承认，或废除，或修改，或重订。”我中央人民政府对上述日内瓦各项公约及日内瓦议定书加以审查后，认为各该公约及议定书的内容“在基本上是有利于国际持久和平、并符合于人道主义原则的”。对于这些公约的承认，再一次说明了我国政府和人民对于和平事业的努力及酷爱和平的真诚。更具体表现了我国外交政策的高度原则性和正义性。
    现行的日内瓦四个公约虽然签订于一九四九年，但其历史可以推溯到十九世纪后半期。战俘公约是代替了一九二九年的日内瓦公约，而后者又是从一八九九年及一九○七年的海牙陆战法规与习惯公约演化出来的。改善战地武装部队伤者病者境遇公约的前身是经过一八六四、一九○六及一九二九年三次修订的日内瓦公约。改善海上武装部队伤者病者及遇船难者境遇公约则是从一九○七年的海牙第十号公约脱胎出来。战时保护平民公约是一个新公约，但它的原则可以从海牙陆战法规与习惯公约第三节中找到根源。
    十八世纪以来，随着资本主义国家间的竞争加剧，战争规模日益扩大，战争的残酷性更加怵目惊心；同时在这时候人道主义逐渐在人类思想中抬头，正直的舆论要求废止战争，至少限制战争的破坏性。当时欧洲各国的统治者在人民的压力之下不得不对人道主义作一些让步。一八六四年日内瓦会议和一八九九年及一九○七年海牙会议都是这种让步的具体表现。这些会议曾通过了一系列的公约和宣言，把某些减少战争祸害的、业已存在的习惯加以条文化，并制订若干规则来解决一些具体问题。这些公约和宣言归纳起来包括下列几条基本原则：（一）在战争中对敌人的伤害只是制服敌人的手段而不是目的，因此，伤害敌人的手段不是漫无限制的，凡非军事上所必要的伤害与破坏均应禁止；（二）某些种战争武器和方法（如达姆弹、毒气等）被认为违反人道，而被禁止使用；（三）改善战俘及伤病人员的待遇，减少其痛苦；（四）尊重平民生命财产，禁止对其直接攻击。
    海牙公约、日内瓦公约、以及类似的国际条约与习惯不会被帝国主义国家所自动遵守是很显而易见的。因为帝国主义国家的统治集团热衷于战争，他们不惜使用非人道的战争手段来追逐侵略的利益。因此，帝国主义国家除了为自己方便或顾虑对方报复之外，是不会热心遵守这些规则的。在第一次和第二次世界大战期间，帝国主义国家都曾破坏战争法规，特别是在第二次世界大战期间纳粹德国和法西斯日本，对于这些国际规则更是肆无忌惮地加以破坏。希特勒匪徒在苏联及东欧国家领土上的暴行令人发指。对于苏联的被俘人员，他们完全不顾国际法的规定，施行了极端惨酷的、非人道的待遇。德军总部战俘部长莱纳克曾公开下令全军，对苏军战俘不给予日内瓦公约所规定的待遇。苏军战俘随时可以被枪杀；苏军政治人员无一幸免。纳粹战犯罗森堡致战犯季特尔的信供出：苏军战俘“大部分饿死或冻死，成千的战俘死于斑疹伤寒……许多战俘营没有屋子，战俘们无论在下雨或下雪的天气都是露宿”。一九四三年七月以后，许多战俘被用作细菌战的试验品，而致死亡。对于占领地的平民，纳粹进行了大规模、以消灭人种为目的的、有计划的大屠杀。在苏联及东欧被屠杀的平民以百万计。捷克的莱迪斯地方被夷为平地。在波兰血腥屠杀的结果，波兰人被杀害的占全国人口三分之一！在远东方面，日本帝国主义杀害了我国人民在一千万人以上，仅仅南京一次大屠杀就杀死男女老幼三十万人。战争期间日寇并在中国各地进行惨无人道的化学战及细菌战。
    但是，希特勒匪徒和日本法西斯战犯们错误估计了世界人民的力量和国际法的力量。自从世界上出现了苏联以后，有利于国际和平的“国际条约”和“国际法”不再是帝国主义自欺欺人的口头禅，而成为真正具有制裁力量的实在法律。纳粹和日本战犯没有认识这点，终于在纽伦堡、东京和伯力受到了正义的制裁。
    第二次世界大战证明旧有战争法规有很多不完备的地方。一九四五年各国政府及红十字会表示希望对旧日内瓦公约加以修改。一九四九年四月由瑞士政府召集日内瓦外交会议，参加的国家有六十三个，苏联及东欧新民主主义国家都派代表参加，并在会议中起了决定性的作用。会议结果通过上面所举四项公约。签字参加这些公约的国家共六十一国，包括中、苏、美、英、法在内。
    新公约重要特点之一即把纽伦堡的“个人负责”原则加以明文规定。依照过去的国际法，违反国际法的事项，如系执行国家政策，或系奉行上级命令行为者不负个人责任。现行战俘公约第一二九条（以及改善战地伤者病者境遇公约第四九条，改善海上伤者病者及遇船难者境遇公约第五○条，战时保护平民公约第一四六条）规定：缔约国应制定立法，对严重破坏本公约的人“处以有效的刑事制裁”；同时，“各缔约国有义务搜捕被控为曾犯，或曾令人犯，此种严重破坏本公约行为之人，并应将此种人，不分国籍，送交各该国法庭”。这就是说：破坏公约的罪犯不仅在受害国被认为罪犯，即在第三国亦应被认为罪犯，该第三国有义务将此等人逮捕法办。
    新公约第二特点是：公约不仅适用于两缔约国间经过宣战的战争，并且适用于任何其他武装冲突，即使其中一国不承认有战争状态存在（各约第二条）。特别是在第一次世界大战以后，帝国主义国家为规避国际法的制裁，于从事侵略时，往往避免采取正式宣战方式。例如日寇侵略中国直到一九四一年以前都是“不宣而战”。美国侵略朝鲜也未经宣战，而是无耻地诡称为“警察行动”。新公约的上述规定有效地堵塞了帝国主义钻空子的机会。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相已于一九五○年七月十三日发表宣言，声明：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军严格遵守关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约的原则。美帝国主义不能再藉口“不承认”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，或藉口战争未经宣告，来抵赖违反国际法的责任了。
    和纳粹德国及法西斯日本一样，美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中严重地破坏了国际法。他们置所有国际义务于不顾，对战俘和朝鲜和平居民进行了血腥的屠杀、虐待和蹂躏。就战俘公约而言，该公约明明规定：“实际战事停止后战俘应即予释放并遣返，不得迟延”（第一一八条），而美国强盗们却狂妄地要求大批扣留我方被俘人员。公约规定“在任何情况下，战俘不得放弃本公约……所赋予彼等权利之一部或全部”（第七条），而美国强盗们却偏偏提出所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则。公约规定：战俘须受人道待遇，禁止拘留国之任何不法行为或不法行为以致战俘死亡或严重危害其健康，公约特别指出，不得对战俘加以肢体残伤，“或供任何医学或科学试验”（第十三条），而美国强盗们却对手无寸铁的我方被俘人员进行大规模屠杀，并把我方被俘人员当作原子弹和细菌战的试验品。公约规定：战俘应“免致遭受暴行或恫吓及侮辱”（第十三条），“战俘在一切情况下应享受人身及荣誉之尊重”（第十四条），而美国强盗们却强迫在我方被俘人员身上刺字，并经常施以威胁与侮辱。
    美国侵略者对于日内瓦公约以及有关的国际法悍然加以破坏，一味蛮横，自以为得计，他们显然没有从希特勒和东条的下场吸取足够的教训。他们也没有充分认识到，在今天，维护和平与人道主义的国际协定已经不再是“一张废纸”，以苏联为首的和平阵营及全世界爱好和平的人民都坚决站在这些协定的后面，誓为后盾。周外长的声明把中国五万万人民的力量投到保卫日内瓦公约的一边，更大大增加了这些条约的威信，这对于全世界维护国际法与国际和平的斗争无疑将发生极端重大的影响。
    日内瓦议定书比起日内瓦公约的历史背景更为悠久。自从脱离了最野蛮的境界以后，人类就已经摈弃了以使用毒物或有毒的武器作为战争手段。资产阶级国际法学者无不一致承认这是最古老的国际习惯法之一。一八九九年海牙公约曾把这条习惯法列入条文。陆战法规与习惯第二十三条规定：“兹特别禁止：（甲）使用毒物或有毒的武器……（戊）使用意在造成不必要痛苦的武器、投射体或物质”。这里所谓“毒物”，是指所有形式的毒质而言，自然包括细菌在内。一八九九年海牙会议并一致通过（当时只有美国企图反对）一项禁止使用毒气的宣言。凡尔赛和约第一七一条规定：毒气或类似物质“既经禁用”，德国不得制造或输入。一九二一年美国对德和约承认该项规定对美国亦属有效。一九二二年华盛顿条约第五条承认毒气及类似物质“既经文明世界普遍舆论所谴责”，各缔约国同意禁止使用（该约后因法国不满意其中潜艇条款，以致未能生效）。一九二五年日内瓦议定书除重申华盛顿条约的规定外，并宣布将此项禁令推广及于细菌武器。日内瓦议定书已经由四十二个国家批准，参加而未批准的仅仅有美、日、巴西、萨尔瓦多、乌拉圭、尼加拉瓜六国。
    这些事实铁一般地证明，对化学及细菌武器的禁止，老早已成为国际习惯法的一部分。在这一点上，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团在他们“关于美国在朝鲜的罪行的报告”中也曾加以肯定。就是退一万步来讲，即使在日内瓦议定书订立以前这习惯法还不够明确、不够具体，那末，日内瓦议定书的订立可以说完全弥补了这些缺陷。而日内瓦议定书既已得到四十二个国家的批准，这议定书本身已构成国际法的一个标准。正如苏联出席联合国安全理事会代表马立克所说“它对于各国的良知和实际行动是有着同样的约束力的”。这样看来，美国在一八九九年企图反对海牙宣言，及一九二五年以后拒绝批准日内瓦议定书，都是徒然的。尽管强盗一天到晚咀咒惩治强盗的法律，但这丝毫不能减损这种法律的拘束性。法律终有一天要把锁链套在强盗的头上。
    人们也许要问：既然禁止毒气及细菌战的国际法已经具备了法律效力，为什么美国至今还拒绝批准日内瓦议定书，而苏联还要号召所有国家来批准它呢？
    我们知道，美国拒绝批准日内瓦议定书是有它的诡计的。在一九二五年讨论批准该议定书时，美国政府已经在考虑将来使用这个“廉价而有效”的武器。甚至远在一八九九年，美国出席海牙会议代表就已经露骨地表示：美国不愿意抛弃这个“日后可能作有利使用的手段”。今天美国黩武主义者们不仅是在考虑或计划使用这种武器，而是实际上已经在朝鲜及我国东北使用起来了。对于这种滔天罪行，美国希图以“未批准日内瓦议定书”为藉口来逃避罪责，显然是徒劳的了。
    美国不肯批准日内瓦议定书恰恰暴露了它的罪恶用心。苏联在联合国安全理事会提出批准日内瓦议定书的号召也正是针对这点而发的。这个号召就像是一面照妖镜，无论妖魔怎样变化多端，在这镜子的光芒照耀之下，一定要原形毕露。现在摆在美国侵略者面前有两条路：或者正式承认使用毒气及细菌武器的非法性，或者拒绝批准议定书，因而赤裸裸地在全世界人民面前显出他们违反人道破坏国际法的杀人犯的原形。
    我们中国人民热烈爱好和平，反对战争，更反对用大规模屠杀平民的武器从事战争。中国过去曾遭受日寇的毒气和细菌的祸害，今天又遭受了美国细菌的袭击。我们对于帝国主义使用这种丧天害理的武器恨入骨髓。我们认识到：今天落在我们头上的细菌弹，明天就可能落在世界其他和平人民头上。因此我们首先响应了苏联的号召，承认了日内瓦议定书。我们将用实际行动来拥护这议定书，一定要彻底制止细菌及毒气战，并把细菌战犯捉拿归案，依法惩办。
    总之，周外长的两个声明充分表达了中国人民爱好和平、维护人道主义的意愿。我们相信和平是可以得到的，正义终将胜利，只有这样，国际法才能得到真正的实施。
