    Local Newspapers Should Emphasize the Propaganda Role of Editorial Cartoons
    To the Editor: We enjoy reading the editorial cartoons published in newspapers most because they help us understand current affairs profoundly through concrete images. For example, the editorial cartoon "The Aggressor's Delusion" published on page three of the July 3rd People's Daily told readers that after suffering a disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, the US imperialists were fantasizing about using the vile tactic of walking out of the negotiations to threaten our side into accepting their unreasonable proposals. However, what the US imperialists could not get on the battlefield, they would not get at the conference table either. This powerfully exposed the shameful behavior of the American aggressors and further aroused the broad masses of readers' hatred for the enemy. The propaganda role of editorial cartoons is significant. However, judging from the newspapers in various regions in July, the use of this propaganda weapon has not been sufficient. Taking the newspapers of major administrative regions in July as an example: the Northeast Daily reprinted five cartoons from the Soviet Crocodile magazine and the German "Cool Breeze" magazine; the Xi'an Masses Daily published eight cartoons, seven of which were reprinted from "Spark Magazine," "Crocodile Magazine," and "New German Newspaper"; the Shanghai Liberation Daily published four cartoons, two of which were reprinted; some newspapers did not publish any. The above situation shows that some newspapers have paid attention to reprinting some good cartoons, but they rarely organize their own creations; some newspapers have neither reprinted nor organized their own cartoons. They do not fully value the role of editorial cartoons. I hope that local newspapers should pay attention to editorial cartoons, do a good job in organizing cartoon creation, so that newspapers can regularly publish some editorial cartoons to help readers understand current affairs.

### 各地报纸应重视时事漫画的宣传作用

    各地报纸应重视时事漫画的宣传作用
    编辑同志：我们最喜欢看报纸上刊登的时事漫画，因为它通过具体的形象帮助我们深刻地了解当前的时事问题。如七月三日人民日报三版刊登的“侵略者的妄想”一幅时事漫画，就告诉读者：美帝国主义者在朝鲜战场上遭受惨败后，又幻想在谈判中利用逃会的卑污手段来威胁我方接受它的无理方案，但美帝国主义者在战场上得不到的东西，在会议上同样是得不到的。这就有力地揭发了美国侵略者的可耻行为，更加激发了广大读者对敌人的仇恨。时事漫画的宣传作用，是很大的。但从七月份各地的报纸来看，在这一宣传武器的运用上，是作得不够的。以七月份的各大行政区报纸为例：东北日报转载了苏联鳄鱼画报及德国“凉风”等杂志的五幅漫画；西安群众日报发表了八幅漫画，其中七幅是转载“星火杂志”、“鳄鱼画报”、“新德意志报”的；上海解放日报发表了四幅漫画，其中两幅是转载的；有些报纸则一幅也没有刊载。上述情况说明有些报纸已注意了转载一些好的漫画，但自己很少组织创作；有些报纸既没转载也没组织自己的漫画。他们还不十分重视时事漫画的作用。我希望各地报纸，应重视时事漫画，把组织漫画的工作作好，使报纸上能经常地刊载一些时事漫画，帮助读者了解时事问题。　　　　　　　　　　北　风　达英騄
