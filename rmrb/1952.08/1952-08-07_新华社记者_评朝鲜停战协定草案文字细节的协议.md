Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 6th: Our special correspondent reports: The textual details of the Korean Armistice Agreement draft have now been fully agreed upon. The only remaining issue is the use of the terms "Korea" and "United Nations Forces" in the agreement draft. The US side has overturned existing agreements and insists on referring to "Korea" as so-called "South Korea" in the Chinese text and referring to "United Nations Forces" as so-called "International Allied Forces" in the Korean text, and therefore has not been resolved. The agreement on the armistice agreement is the result of our side's firm efforts in the meetings of the staff officers of both sides. The only remaining issue is to resolve the repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with Articles 51 and 52 of the agreed-upon draft armistice agreement, so that the Korean peace expected by the world can be quickly realized. However, it is precisely on this only issue that the US side still insists on its absurd demands, insisting on detaining our captured personnel, and repeatedly abusing the shameless methods of adjourning and long recesses to refuse consultation, in order to obstruct the easily achievable Korean armistice.

When our side proposed terminating the administrative meeting on July 25, we suggested holding a staff meeting to agree on certain textual details of the draft agreement. Harrison opposed it at the time, arguing that it was useless to agree on the textual details of the draft agreement before an agreement was reached on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. However, when he could not refuse and had to agree to our proposal, Harrison deceived reporters outside the tent meeting, saying that General Nan Ri wanted the staff meeting to "draw up a new draft of the armistice agreement." This lie told by Harrison exposed his intention in agreeing to convene the staff meeting, which was to engage in further bargaining at the staff meeting and continue to obstruct the progress of the meeting.

With this aim, the US side initially refused to conduct discussions at the staff meeting. Subsequently, the US side launched various obstructionist tactics at the meeting, overturning the agreement on the terms "Korea" and "United Nations Forces," deliberately creating difficulties on Article 52 of the draft, continuing to make a fuss about the terms "captured personnel" and "prisoners of war," and attempting to confuse the repatriation of prisoners of war with their so-called "release" of prisoners of war illegally handed over to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs. It was only due to our side's firm efforts that the textual details of the draft armistice agreement were able to achieve substantial agreement in their entirety.

Now, the Korean armistice negotiations have reached a full agreement on everything except the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. The principles regarding the repatriation of prisoners have also been clearly stipulated in Article 51 of the draft armistice agreement. The article states: "When this armistice agreement comes into effect, all prisoners of war held by each side shall be released and repatriated as soon as possible, and the release and repatriation of these prisoners of war shall be carried out in accordance with the lists exchanged and corrected by both sides before the signing of this armistice agreement." The question now is: Is the US side willing to abandon their own invented unreasonable principle of "non-forcible repatriation" and abide by Article 51 of the agreed-upon draft to finally and quickly resolve the issue of prisoners of war? From the current signs, the US side has still not abandoned its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. They are not only continuing to adopt the method of long recesses in an extremely arrogant manner in an attempt to gradually cancel the negotiations, but also ridiculously spreading the illusion that so-called "military pressure" can force our side to accept its unreasonable plan. In fact, the US side is precisely under the cover of spreading this illusion that it is pursuing a policy of bloodshed in order to detain prisoners of war, not hesitating to continue or even expand the Korean War. The stubborn and crazy attitude of the US side has put the negotiations in a dangerous situation. Now is the time for the people of the world to further rise up and demand that the US side resolve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation in accordance with the provisions of the agreement.

### 新华社记者  评朝鲜停战协定草案文字细节的协议

    评朝鲜停战协定草案文字细节的协议
    【新华社开城六日电】本社特派记者报道：朝鲜停战协定草案的文字细节现在已经取得了全部协议，只有在协定草案中，关于“朝鲜”和“联合国军”这两个名词，由于美方推翻已有的协议，要在中文本中称“朝鲜”为所谓“韩国”，并要在朝文本中称“联合国军”为所谓“国际联合军”因此尚未解决。停战协定之取得协议，是我方在双方参谋人员会议上进行了坚定努力的结果。现在剩下的唯一问题，就是按照双方取得了协议的协定草案第五十一款和五十二款解决遣返战俘，使全世界期望的朝鲜和平能够迅速实现。而正是在这个唯一的问题上，美方却仍然坚持它的荒谬主张，一定要扣留我方被俘人员，并一再滥用逃会和长期休会的无耻办法，拒绝协商，来阻挠伸手可及的朝鲜停战的实现。
    在七月二十五日我方建议终止行政性会议时，我方提出了举行参谋会议以商定协定草案若干文字细节的建议。哈利逊当时就表示反对，他的藉口是在战俘遣返问题没有取得协议之前，商定协定草案的文字细节是没有用处的。可是当无法拒绝而不得不同意我方的建议时，哈利逊却在帐篷会议外面欺骗记者们说：南日将军要参谋会议“制订一个停战协定的新草案”。哈利逊撒的这个谎暴露了他所以同意召开参谋会议，是企图在参谋会议上再从事讨价还价，继续阻挠会议之进行。
    怀抱着这样的目的，美方在参谋会议上最初就曾拒绝进行讨论。接着美方就在会上展开了种种阻挠手段，推翻关于“朝鲜”与“联合国军”两个名词的协议，在草案第五十二款上故意刁难，继续在
    “被俘人员”与“战俘”这两个名词上大做文章，并且企图将遣返战俘与他们将战俘非法地移交给蒋介石、李承晚匪帮的所谓“释放”混为一谈。只是由于我方的坚定的努力，停战协定草案的文字细节才得以在实质上取得了全部协议。
    现在朝鲜停战谈判除了遣返战俘问题以外，已经全部达成协议了。关于遣俘的原则，也已经在停战协定草案第五十一款中有了明确的规定。该款条文称：“本停战协定生效时，各方所收容的全部战俘须尽速予以释放与遣返，此项战俘的释放与遣返须按照本停战协定签字前双方所交换并校正的名单执行之。”现在的问题是：美方愿不愿意放弃他们自己发明出来的“不强迫遣返”的无理原则，而遵照双方协议的草案第五十一款来最后迅速解决战俘问题？从现在的迹象看来，美方仍然没有放弃强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，他们不但蛮横已极地继续采取长期休会的办法力图逐渐取消谈判，并且还可笑地散布着所谓“军事压力”可以迫使我方接受其无理方案的幻想。实际上，美方正是在散布这种幻想的幕下，来推行其为了扣留战俘而不惜继续甚至扩大朝鲜战争的流血的政策。美方这种顽固而疯狂的态度，已使谈判处于险境。现在是全世界人民进一步起来要求美方按照协定条文来解决遣返战俘问题的时候了。
