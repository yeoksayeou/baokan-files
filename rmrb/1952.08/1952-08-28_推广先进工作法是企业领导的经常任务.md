    Promoting Advanced Work Methods is a Regular Task for Enterprise Leaders
    Li Dazhi, Peng Xiling

    Since the cotton textile factories in Tianjin switched to using lower quality raw cotton in June of this year, the yarn breakage rate in the spinning workshops and the cloth breakage rate in the weaving workshops have increased, and the roller lapping rate has risen. When workers saw that the work was not easy, some were anxious but had no solution; some even did cleaning work during meal times; some complained that the leadership should not have switched to using lower quality raw cotton. Many leading cadres in the factories did not actively try to improve technology and overcome difficulties. Not only did they fail to lead the workers to further master the 1951 Weaving Work Method and the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, but they also issued an erroneous statement: "The cotton is bad, the breakage rate is high, and the workers are already very tired. Isn't it too unconcerned for the masses to ask them to master advanced work methods?" When the workers saw that the leading cadres held such a skeptical attitude towards advanced work methods, they simply stopped implementing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method. As a result, in July, most of the state-owned cotton textile factories in Tianjin did not complete their production tasks.

    Can the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method solve the current difficulties encountered by the cotton textile factories in Tianjin? Yes, because these two work methods were originally the best weapons to overcome high breakage rates. Many outstanding workers in the Tianjin cotton textile factories, because they insisted on implementing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method, achieved excellent production results even when using the same raw cotton as other workers, which is proof. For example, spinning workers Fei Guizhen, Wang Dalian, etc., because they insisted on implementing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, each person produced only 1.3 to 1.4 pounds of roller lapping per shift (most spinning frame operators produced 3 to 4 pounds). Weaving workers Zhang Haiwu, Gao Liandi, etc., because they insisted on implementing the 1951 Weaving Work Method, each loom produced more than 37 to 38 yards per shift (the average weaving worker only produced 35 yards).

    Of course, poor raw cotton will increase production difficulties and also increase the difficulty of promoting advanced work methods, but these difficulties are not insurmountable. The state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory has set a good example. Technician Peng Xiling and others realized the importance of solving the difficulties of poor cotton sliver and roving quality caused by poor raw cotton, which could reduce the yarn breakage rate and roller lapping in the spinning workshops, and also help the spinning workshop workers implement the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. They went deep into the workshops to research a set of methods, such as re-beating the lower quality Indian cotton on the scutcher to clean it; and mixing the cotton lap, separating the cotton sliver before and after the steel wire brush in the carding machine, and the yarn sliver before and after the spinning frame in the roving workshop, so that the good cotton and bad cotton are mixed evenly. In order to make their methods more practical, they also convened workshop directors, regular shift administrators, maintenance workers, and veteran technical workers to hold discussions and research, and supplemented their correct opinions into the technical measures plan; then, they handed this plan over to the worker masses for discussion, and cooperated with the workshop cadres to carry out extensive publicity and education work among the workers, proposing the slogan "The front process serves the back process, and serves the Hao Jianxiu Work Method." After repeated study by the workers, they also put forward many suggestions to enrich the technical measures plan. This technical measures plan has been actively implemented by the worker masses, and most of it has been realized so far, and some have exceeded the original plan. For example, the re-beating of Indian cotton was originally planned to be 10,000 catties per shift per day, but now it has reached 13,000 to 14,000 catties; the regular lap rate has increased from 87.2% to 93.4%; the weight difference rate of cotton sliver and roving has been reduced from about 4% to 2%. The improvement of the quality of the front-end products has greatly helped the spinning workshop to improve production and promote advanced experience.

    From the above examples, it can be seen that promoting advanced work methods is a regular task for enterprise leaders, and should be consistently implemented, and should not retreat at the slightest difficulty. As long as the leading cadres and technical personnel can rely on the workers wholeheartedly, even if they encounter certain difficulties in production, they can be overcome, and advanced work methods can continue to be promoted.

    推广先进工作法是企业领导的经常任务
    李达之　彭熙龄
    天津各棉纺织厂自今年六月改用低级品质的原棉后，细纱间、织布间的断头率增多，皮辊花率上升。工人见活不好作，有的干着急也没有办法；有的在吃饭时间也做清洁工作；有的抱怨领导方面不该改用原棉。工厂的许多领导干部，也没有积极设法去改进技术，克服困难，他们不但没有领导工人进一步掌握一九五一织布工作法、郝建秀工作法，反发出一种错误的论调：“棉花坏，断头又多，工人干活已经很累了，再叫他们掌握先进工作法不是太没有群众观点了吗！”工人们见领导干部对先进工作法抱这样怀疑的态度，也就干脆不去执行郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法了。因此，七月份，国营天津各棉纺织厂大部分没有完成生产任务。
    推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法，能不能解决天津各棉纺织厂目前所遇到的困难呢？是能解决的，因为这两个工作法，原是克服断头多的最好武器。天津棉纺织厂的许多优秀工人，由于坚持执行郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法，他们和其他工人使用同样的原棉，却获得优异的生产成绩，就是证明。例如细纱工人费桂珍、王大连等，因为坚持执行了郝建秀工作法，每班每人皮辊花只出到一点三至一点四磅（一般细纱挡车工都出到了三至四磅）。织布工人张海武、高连弟等，因为坚持执行了一九五一织布工作法，每班每台产量达到三十七至三十八码多（一般的织布工人产量只达到三十五码）。
    当然，由于原棉不好，会增加生产的困难，也会增加推广先进工作法的困难，但这些困难也不是不可解决的。国营天津第二棉纺织厂就作出了一个良好的先例。该厂技师彭熙龄等认识到如果解决了因原棉不好而造成的棉条、粗纱质量不高的困难，细纱间的断头率和皮辊花便可减少，也能帮助细纱间工人推行郝建秀工作法的重要意义。便深入车间研究出一套办法，例如把质量比较坏的印度棉在清花机上加以返打一次，使之清洁；又用花卷掺和花、分清钢丝间刷车前后的棉条和粗纱间纺车前后排的纱条，使好棉和坏棉掺和得均匀。为使他们的办法能更切合实际，又召集车间主任、常日班管理员、保全员、老技术工人座谈研究，把他们正确的意见补充到技术措施计划中去；再把这计划交给工人群众讨论，并配合车间干部，在工人中展开广泛的宣传教育工作，提出“前纺为后纺服务，为郝建秀工作法服务”的口号。经过工人反复研究，他们又提出不少建议，充实了技术措施计划。这项技术措施计划经工人群众积极实行，至今大部分已实现，有的已超过原来的计划。如返打印度棉，原计划每班每日打一万斤，现已打到一万三、四千斤；正卷率由百分之八十七点二提高到了百分之九十三点四；棉条、粗纱轻重差异率由百分之四左右降低至百分之二。由于前纺产品质量提高，大大帮助了细纱车间提高生产和推广先进经验。
    从以上的例子中可以看出，推广先进工作法是企业领导的一项经常任务，应该坚持贯彻，不应该稍有困难，即表示退缩。只要领导干部、技术人员能全心全意依靠工人，即使在生产中碰到某些困难，也是可以克服的，可以继续推广先进工作法的。
