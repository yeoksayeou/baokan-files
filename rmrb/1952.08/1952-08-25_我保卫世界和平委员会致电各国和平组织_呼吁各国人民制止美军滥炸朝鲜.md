Xinhua News Agency, 24th. The China Peace Committee sent a telegram to the peace committees of all countries and all peace-loving people to jointly protest the recent barbaric bombing of peaceful cities in northern Korea by U.S. imperialism and resolutely stop this inhuman and brutal act by the United States. The telegram reads as follows:

To the Peace Committees of all countries and to all peace-loving people in all countries!

On August 18, the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland, representing the Korean people, justly accused and protested the serious crimes of the American aggressors' recent planned and indiscriminate bombing of 78 peaceful cities in northern Korea, massively destroying peaceful facilities in Korea, and collectively massacring peaceful Korean residents, and fervently appealed to peace-loving people all over the world to jointly stop this unprecedented beastly atrocity by the United States. The Chinese people support this solemn protest by the Korean people with infinite sympathy and strength and are willing to respond to this righteous call with practical actions.

As the facts pointed out in the Korean people's appeal, the American aggressors have long destroyed and trampled on all basic principles of international law and human morality in the war of aggression against Korea. For the past two years, the American aggressors have consistently carried out crimes of mass slaughter of peaceful people in Korea. They indiscriminately bomb undefended cities and villages, and use napalm bombs, gas bombs, and bacteriological weapons to achieve their goal of collectively massacring the Korean people. Because of military failures on the front lines and the bankruptcy of their conspiracies in the Kaesong negotiations, the American aggressors are attempting to further provoke a new war through this indiscriminate bombing, creating tension in the Far East and Asia. This is a serious threat to human dignity and world security, and it is intolerable not only to the Korean people and the Chinese people, but also to all peace-loving and just people in the world.

We, the Chinese people, are determined to stand with the Korean people and continue to fight to the end against aggression, to defend peace, and to stop the brutal crimes of the American aggressors. At the same time, we call on all peace-loving and just people in the world to unite and resolutely stop the realization of the American aggressors' shameful plan to destroy human life and civilization. We, like the Korean people, firmly believe that "American war criminals will be judged by all the good people of the world and will be subject to the legal sanctions they deserve!"

    我保卫世界和平委员会致电各国和平组织
    呼吁各国人民制止美军滥炸朝鲜
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会致电世界各国和平委员会和各国所有爱好和平的人们，共同起来抗议最近美帝国主义对朝鲜北部和平城市的野蛮轰炸，坚决制止美国这一灭绝人性的残暴行为。电文如下：各国和平委员会并转各国所有爱好和平的人民！
    八月十八日，朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会代表朝鲜人民，对美国侵略者最近有计划地狂轰滥炸朝鲜北部七十八个和平城市，大量毁灭朝鲜的和平设施，集体屠杀朝鲜和平居民的严重罪行，提出正义的控诉和抗议，并热望地呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民共起制止美国这种史无前例的野兽暴行。中国人民以无限的同情和力量支持朝鲜人民这种严正的抗议，并愿以实际行动来响应这个正义的呼吁。
    诚如朝鲜人民呼吁书上所指出的事实，美国侵略者在侵朝战争中早就破坏和蹂躏了所有国际公法和人类道德的基本原则。美国侵略者两年来在朝鲜一贯进行着大量屠杀和平人民的罪行。他们滥炸不设防的城市和乡村，使用凝固汽油弹、毒气弹和细菌武器，以达到它集体屠杀朝鲜人民的目的。美国侵略者因在前线上的军事失败和在开城谈判上的阴谋破产，于是妄图更进一步借此狂轰滥炸行为，进行发动新战争的挑衅，造成远东和亚洲的紧张局势。这是对人类尊严与世界安全的严重威胁，不仅为朝鲜人民、中国人民所不能容忍，全世界爱好和平正义的人民也都是不能容忍的。
    我们中国人民坚决与朝鲜人民一道，继续为反抗侵略、保卫和平、制止美国侵略者的残暴罪行而斗争到底。同时，我们呼吁世界一切爱好和平正义的人民共同起来，坚决制止美国侵略者毁灭人类生命与文明的可耻计划的实现。我们和朝鲜人民同样坚决地相信：“美国战犯必将受到全世界善良人民的审判，必将受到应得的法律制裁”！
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
    一九五二年八月二十三日
