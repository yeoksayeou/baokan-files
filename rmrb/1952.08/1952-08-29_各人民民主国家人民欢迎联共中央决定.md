Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: According to TASS, newspapers in the People's Democratic countries of the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania warmly welcomed the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) to convene the 19th Congress.

    In the German Democratic Republic, the editorial of "Neues Deutschland" stated: The working people of the world are all overjoyed to see the new Soviet Five-Year Development Plan. They are studying it and drawing from it new and infinite strength to fight for peace, a better life, and national independence. "Tribüne" published an editorial stating: The direction of the Five-Year Plan draft to be discussed at the 19th Congress of the CPSU once again proves to the world that the Soviet Union wants peace. The newspaper also called on the German people to learn from the Soviet people, to learn how to carry out peaceful construction, how to fight for peace, and how to defend their motherland from the conspiracies of the imperialists.

    The editorial of "Trybuna Ludu," the organ of the Polish United Workers' Party, stated: Each congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a historical event of great significance. This congress and its great ideological contributions will also be a powerful motivating force for the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish people. "Głos Pracy" stated: The past congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union not only indicated the road to Soviet development, but their resolutions were also extremely valuable instructions for the entire international workers' movement and valuable instructions for the people of the world fighting for peace and progress.

    Czechoslovakia's "Rudé Právo" stated: From every figure of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, one can faintly see the outline of communism, and the enviable, affluent, and happy life of the Soviet people, who are beginning to stride into a communist society under the wise leadership of the great Stalin.

    All national newspapers in Bulgaria published the decision of the CPSU Central Committee and the draft instructions on the new Five-Year Plan on their front pages with large headlines, and published many editorials and articles on the matter. Pavlov, Chairman of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, wrote in "Otechestven Front": The resolutions passed under the leadership of the great Stalin and summarized using creative Marxist methods will have an inestimable guiding role for us in solving the major theoretical, organizational, and technical problems we encounter in life.

    The editorial of Hungary's "Szabad Nép" said of the new Soviet Five-Year Plan: This plan, which guides the Soviet Union towards communism, will also guide all mankind towards the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism. For the People's Democratic countries, including Hungary, the Soviet Fifth Five-Year Plan is a vivid example of the road to a new life that these countries are now following. The Fifth Five-Year Plan is a serious warning to the warmongers and another powerful obstacle in the warmongers' path of war preparation.

    Romanian newspapers also launched heated discussions on the convening of the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. "Scînteia" published documents issued by the CPSU Central Committee on the front page under the large banner headline "Glory to the Great Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the Party of Lenin and Stalin - the Lighthouse of the Working People of the World!". The newspaper also published an editorial stating: The draft of the new Soviet Five-Year Plan strongly and clearly reflects the enormous superiority of the socialist economic system over the decadent capitalist system. It proves the Soviet Union's policy of peace and its strong confidence in the inevitable victory of the forces of peace.

    Albanian newspapers also published editorials one after another. The editorial of "Zëri i Popullit" stated: All peace-loving people will recognize that further consolidation of the socialist motherland will provide the most reliable guarantee for the cause of defending peace.

    Newspapers in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, published the full text of the documents issued by the CPSU Central Committee. Upon hearing the news of the convening of the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the people of Mongolia were very excited and encouraged, and launched heated discussions on the various documents.

    各人民民主国家人民欢迎联共中央决定
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社消息：德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚等人民民主国家的报纸，热烈欢迎苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会关于召开第十九次代表大会的决定。
    在德意志民主共和国，“新德意志报”的社论说：全世界的劳动人民在看到新的苏联发展五年计划时，莫不欢欣鼓舞。他们都在研究它，并且从它那里吸取为和平、为美好的生活及民族独立而进行斗争的新的无限的力量。“论坛报”发表社论说：将在联共第十九次代表大会上讨论的五年计划草案的方针，再一次向全世界证明了苏联是要和平的。该报并号召德国人民向苏联人民学习，学习怎样进行和平建设，怎样为和平而斗争，怎样保卫祖国以免帝国主义者的阴谋侵害。
    波兰统一工人党机关报“人民论坛报”的社论说：苏联共产党的每一次代表大会都是一个具有重大意义的历史事件。这次代表大会以及它的伟大的思想贡献对于波兰统一工人党和波兰人民来说，也将是一个有力的鼓动力。“劳动之声”报说：苏联共产党的历次代表大会不单指示了苏联发展的道路，而且它们的决议是对整个国际工人运动的非常宝贵的指示，是对全世界为和平与进步而斗争的人民的宝贵指示。
    捷克斯洛伐克的“红色权利报”说：从第五个五年计划的每一个数字都可以隐约地看见共产主义的轮廓，看见正在伟大的斯大林的英明领导下开始跨进共产主义社会的苏联人民的令人羡慕的富足、幸福的生活。
    保加利亚全国报纸都在首页以大字标题发表了联共中央的决定和关于新五年计划的指示草案，并就此事发表了许多社论和文章。保加利亚科学院主席巴夫洛夫在“祖国阵线报”上写道：在伟大的斯大林的领导下通过的、以具有创造性的马克思主义的方法加以概括的决议，对我们来说，将要对解决我们在生活中遇到的重大理论、组织与技术问题，起难以估计的指导作用。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”的社论谈到苏联新五年计划说：这一个引导苏联走向共产主义的计划，也将引导全人类走向和平、民主和社会主义事业的胜利。对于人民民主国家，包括匈牙利在内，苏联第五个五年计划是这些国家现在遵循的走向新生活的道路的一个生动范例。第五个五年计划是对战争制造者的一个严重警告，是战争制造者的备战道路上的又一个强大的障碍。
    罗马尼亚的报纸也就苏联共产党召开代表大会一事展开了热烈的讨论。“火花报”以首页地位在“光荣归于伟大的苏联共产党（布尔什维克）列宁—斯大林的党——世界劳动人民的灯塔！”的大字通栏标题下，刊载了联共中央发布的文件。该报并发表社论说：苏联新五年计划草案强烈而明显地反映了社会主义经济制度较之腐朽的资本主义制度具有的巨大优越性。它证明了苏联的和平政策及其对和平力量必胜的坚强信心。
    阿尔巴尼亚各报也纷纷发表社论。“人民之声报”的社论说：所有爱好和平的人民都会认识到：社会主义祖国的进一步巩固将使保卫和平的事业获得最可靠的保障。
    蒙古人民共和国首都乌兰巴托的报纸全文刊载了联共中央所发布的各项文件。听到苏联共产党召开代表大会的消息，蒙古全国人民都很兴奋鼓舞，并纷纷就各项文件展开热烈的讨论。
