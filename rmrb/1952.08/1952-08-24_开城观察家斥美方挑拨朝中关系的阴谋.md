Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 23rd: The fact that U.S. Chief Delegate Harrison openly attempted to sow discord between the Korean and Chinese peoples at the meeting table on August 19th shows that the U.S. side has reached the end of its rope.

The U.S. attempt to drive a wedge between Korea and China is nothing new. As early as July 18th, our Chief Delegate General Nam Il pointed out that the preposterous figure of 83,000 POWs put forward by the U.S. side, as well as the classification figures of withholding 20 percent of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war and 68 percent of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, harbored ulterior motives. The U.S. attempted to sow discord between the peoples of Korea and China by concentrating on detaining the vast majority of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, fantasizing that the Korean and Chinese People's Armies fighting side by side would allow them to handle Korean and Chinese prisoners of war separately, and let them detain any large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. General Nam Il clearly told the U.S. representative at that time that this despicable U.S. conspiracy would absolutely not succeed; the issue of POW repatriation in the Korean armistice negotiations must be resolved according to the principles of the Geneva Convention, in accordance with the POW repatriation clauses already agreed upon by both sides, and our concrete plan for repatriating prisoners of war to their homes to live in peace.

As expected, on August 19th, the U.S. representative once again openly and shamelessly provoked the relationship between Korea and China at the conference table. Observers here pointed out that this move by the U.S. side only shows that their so-called "military pressure" has gone bankrupt, and they have resorted to this extremely stupid trick out of sheer desperation. The unbreakable friendship forged with blood by the peoples of Korea and China in the struggle against aggression is destined to completely bankrupt any U.S. attempt to sow discord. If the U.S. still wants an armistice in Korea, it should abandon this ridiculous fantasy as soon as possible and honestly resolve the issue of POW repatriation according to the principles of the Geneva Convention and Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides.

### 开城观察家斥美方挑拨朝中关系的阴谋

    开城观察家斥美方挑拨朝中关系的阴谋
    【新华社开城二十三日电】美方首席代表哈利逊在八月十九日的会议桌上竟然公开挑拨朝中人民的关系，这说明美方已经到了穷途末路的境地。
    美方企图挑拨朝中关系的阴谋是由来已久的。早在七月十八日，我方首席代表南日将军就已经指出：美方所提出的荒谬的八万三千的遣俘概数以及扣留百分之二十朝鲜人民军被俘人员和百分之六十八中国人民志愿军被俘人员的分类数字，本身就包藏着不可告人的阴谋。美方企图以集中扣留绝大部分中国人民志愿军被俘人员的办法来挑拨朝中两国人民之间的关系，幻想并肩作战的朝中人民军队会允许他们分别处理朝中被俘人员，听任他们大批扣留朝中被俘人员的任何一部分。南日将军当时就已经明白地告诉美方代表：美方这种卑劣的阴谋是绝对不能达到目的的；朝鲜停战谈判中的遣俘问题必须根据日内瓦公约的原则，按照双方已经协议的遣俘条款和我方遣返战俘回家过和平生活的具体方案予以解决。
    一点也不出预料，八月十九日，美方代表又在会议桌上公然对朝中关系进行无耻挑拨。此间观察家指出，美方出此下着，只能表示他们的所谓“军事压力”已经破产，穷极无聊，才使出这种愚蠢透顶的伎俩。朝中人民在反侵略斗争中用鲜血凝结起来的牢不可破的友谊，注定美方任何挑拨伎俩都必然要完全破产。如果美方还要在朝鲜停战，就应该趁早收起这种可笑的幻想，老老实实地根据日内瓦公约和双方业已同意的停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款的原则解决遣俘问题。
