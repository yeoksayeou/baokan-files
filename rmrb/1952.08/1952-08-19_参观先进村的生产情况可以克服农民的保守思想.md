    Visiting the Production of Advanced Villages Can Overcome the Conservative Thinking of Farmers
    Editor: Yangzhuang Village in Yuanyang County, Pingyuan Province, was a famous "poor village." The village's land was all sandy and alkaline, with very little yield. After liberation, the masses organized and used various methods to improve the soil, greatly increasing crop yields. In the past, some land could only yield one hundred and ten jin of grain per mu, but now it has increased to more than seven hundred jin. In order to educate the masses and overcome the conservative thinking of farmers, the Yuanyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently organized 150 labor models, village cadres, and activists from 32 villages to visit the production situation in Yangzhuang Village. Some people said when they went, "Yangzhuang Village has bad land, everyone knows that, how can it increase production?" When they arrived in Yangzhuang Village, they first saw that the crops were growing very luxuriantly, and then listened to the report of Wang Baocai, a high-yield farmer. He said: "We organized mutual aid, and the strength is great! Before mutual aid, my land could only be plowed five inches deep; after mutual aid, it was plowed eight inches deep. In the past, my land could only yield 120 jin per mu, but this year it yielded 700 jin, increasing the yield by nearly five times per mu." The visitors freely interviewed people in the village and found that except for landlords, rich peasants, and four households of individual farmers, everyone else in the village was organized. Most mutual aid groups have implemented a work point system, and every household has made a production plan, and everyone knows what the plan contains. The visitors asked a fourteen-year-old girl in the village why she wanted to carry out the patriotic production increase movement, and the little girl answered logically and clearly. This surprised the visitors, who said: "This little girl is more enlightened than us!" The visitors truly saw that Yangzhuang Village had indeed changed, and unanimously expressed their intention to learn from it and overcome the conservative thinking that "production cannot be further improved."

    参观先进村的生产情况可以克服农民的保守思想
    编辑同志：平原省原阳县杨庄村是个著名的“穷村”。全村的土地都是沙碱薄地，出产很少。解放以后，群众组织起来，用各种办法改良了土壤，使农作物的产量大大提高。过去有些土地每亩只能收获百十斤粮食，现在已增加到七百斤以上。中共原阳县委员会为了教育群众，克服农民的保守思想，在最近组织了三十二个村的一百五十名劳动模范、村干部和积极分子，参观杨庄村的生产情况。去时有些人说：“杨庄村地不好，谁都知道，它还能增产？”他们到了杨庄村，首先看到庄稼长得十分茂盛，又听了丰产户王保才的报告。他说：“我们组织了互助，力量可大啦！没互助时，我的地只能犁五寸深；互助以后，犁到八寸深。往年我的地每亩只能收一百二十斤，今年收了七百斤，每亩产量提高了将近五倍。”参观的人在村里自由访问，发现全村除地主、富农和四户单干农民外，其余都组织起来了。大多数互助组都实行了计工评分，家家都订了生产计划，人人都知道计划的内容是什么。参观的人问村里一个十四岁的小姑娘，为什么要开展爱国增产运动，小姑娘答的头头是道。这使访问的人惊讶不止，说：“这小妮子比咱觉悟还高！”参观的人们真正看到杨庄村确是变了样子，一致表示要向它学习，克服“生产不能再提高”的保守思想。
