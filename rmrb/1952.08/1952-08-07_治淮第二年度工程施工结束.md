    The second year of the great Huai River harnessing project has been completed before the flood season. From the full commencement of work in mid-November of last year to mid-July of this year (with a short period of shutdown during the winter), the completed work on the Huai River includes 187 million cubic meters of earthwork, 400,000 cubic meters of stonework, and 55,000 cubic meters of concrete. In addition, the earthwork of small-scale projects such as digging ditches and building ponds and dams, which were self-organized by the people on both banks of the Huai River's main and tributary streams, also reached 100 million cubic meters. The total of the two earthwork figures is nearly 300 million cubic meters (when construction began last winter, this agency reported that the planned completion was nearly 400 million cubic meters, which included 200 million cubic meters of small-scale projects self-organized by the people; only half of this small-scale project was completed according to plan). The completion of this year's project has brought the great Huai River harnessing project a further victory compared to the first year. Of the entire Huai River harnessing project's plan to store 20 billion cubic meters of floodwater, 50 percent has now been completed after two years of hard work; river courses that have been silted up for decades have been initially cleared; irrigation projects have also begun to be built in some areas, laying a favorable foundation for large-scale farmland irrigation projects in the future. From now on, the people on both sides of the Huai River will be basically free from "minor rain, minor disaster," and the damage from "major rain, major disaster" will be greatly reduced. Even if a flood as large as that of 1950 occurs, it can effectively ensure that 24 million mu of farmland will no longer suffer from flooding. Moreover, the Subei Irrigation Main Canal has begun to irrigate farmland in the Subei area, and the Huai River has begun to benefit the people.
    
    The second year of the Huai River harnessing project began in November last year. Nearly three million people, including tens of thousands of various types of workers, 2.4 million laborers, and tens of thousands of cadres, participated in this great project. The main projects carried out in the second year are as follows: In terms of flood storage projects, the Baisha Reservoir and the Banqiao Reservoir were completed in Henan Province in the upper reaches; the survey, design, and drilling of the Nanwan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Huai River and the Boshan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Ru River were completed. In the Dabie Mountains in northern Anhui Province in the middle reaches, the Foziling Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Pi River is currently under construction of the dam in the scorching summer heat. In addition, the four lake flood storage projects completed in the first year in the upper reaches—Laowangpo, Wu Songhu, Jiaotinghu, and Tonghu—were reprocessed and improved this year, improving import and export equipment, dredging flood diversion channels, reinforcing village embankments, and reorganizing the internal drainage system of the flood storage area; In the middle reaches, the Menghe, Wabuhu, and Huayuanhu lake depression flood storage projects were also completed. The above-mentioned completed flood storage projects, together with the flood storage projects completed in the first year, can store a total of 10 billion cubic meters of Huai River floodwater. In terms of river course dredging and reorganization, the Honghe River, Ru River, and other tributaries of the Huai River were reorganized in Henan Province in the upper reaches this year; In addition to dredging the tributaries of the Huai River in the middle reaches (a total of 29 tributaries of the Huai River have been reorganized and dredged in the past year), a huge project was also carried out in Wuhe County east of Bengbu, diverting the Chonghe River and other tributaries directly into Hongze Lake and separating them from the main stream of the Huai River. This project has cut off a section of highland west of Hongze Lake and opened a new diversion river to Hongze Lake. At present, the entire project has not yet been completed. After the project is completed, the Tuohe River and other tributaries will be separated from the main stream of the Huai River. In addition, a project in the lower reaches of the Huai River, the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, which stretches 170 kilometers from Gaoliangjian on the east bank of Hongze Lake in the west to the coast in the east, is also the most important project in the second year. This irrigation main canal has been basically completed in the second year. In addition, more than 20 culverts and sluices have been built in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River in the past year. Among them, the Gaoliangjian intake gate on the Subei Irrigation Main Canal is a very large sluice.
    
    The scale of the second year of the Huai River harnessing project was larger than that of the first year. In terms of earthwork alone, about 100 million cubic meters were completed in the first year, excluding mass agricultural water conservancy projects, and more than 180 million cubic meters were completed in the second year, exceeding the first year by 87 percent. The second year's project was also more arduous than the first year's. The first year's project involved more embankment construction, while the second year's project was mostly difficult projects such as dredging river courses and building valley reservoirs. For example, at the Laolongtan construction site in the Huai River's main and tributary diversion project below Wuhe County, removing four meters of deep mud required the same amount of labor per cubic meter of earthwork as twice that of embankment construction; constructing reservoir earth dams and cutting ridges required the same amount of labor per cubic meter of earth as three times that of embankment construction. In addition, the continuous rain and snow encountered at the start of construction last winter and this spring seriously hindered the progress of the project. However, the Huai River laborers and workers displayed a high degree of work enthusiasm and creativity, and finally overcame all difficulties and successfully completed the task.
    
    At present, except for the Foziling Reservoir project in northern Anhui Province, which is still under construction, laborers and workers in other areas have been demobilized. The Huai River harnessing agencies at all levels are shifting to leading the flood control work of the Huai River; and will systematically train cadres and begin preparations for the third year of the Huai River harnessing project.

    治淮第二年度工程施工结束
    伟大的治淮第二年度工程已在汛前收工。自去年十一月中旬全面开工到今年七月中旬（冬季曾有短期的停工时间）的一年来，治淮已完成的工程，计土工一亿八千七百万公方，砌石四十万公方，混凝土五万五千公方。另外，淮河干支流两岸人民自办的开挖沟洫、建筑塘坝等小型工程的土方也达一亿公方。两项土方数字共计近三亿公方（按去冬开工时，本社曾报道计划完成近四亿公方，这四亿公方是包括了人民自办小型工程两亿公方，此项小型工程，按计划只完成了一半）。这一年度工程的完成，使伟大的治淮工程较第一年获得了更进一步的胜利。整个治淮工程中预计拦蓄洪水二百亿立方公尺的计划，经过两年来努力施工，现已完成百分之五十；淤塞了几十年的河道得到初步整理；部分地区并开始兴办了灌溉工程，为今后大规模兴办农田灌溉工程打下了有利的基础。从此，淮河两岸的人民基本上免除了“小雨小灾”，并大大减轻了“大雨大灾”的灾害，即使发生一九五○年那样大的洪水，也可以有效地保障二千四百万亩农田不再遭受水灾。而且苏北灌溉总渠已开始灌溉苏北区农田，淮河已开始为人民兴利了。
    第二年度治淮工程是从去年十一月开始施工的。参加这一伟大工程的一支劳动大军近三百万人，包括各种工人数十万人，民工二百四十万人，干部数万人。第二年度所做的主要工程：在蓄洪工程方面：上游河南境内修成了白沙水库和板桥水库；淮河干流上游的南湾水库和汝河上游的薄山水库完成了勘察、设计、钻探等工作。中游皖北境内大别山区渒河上游的佛子岭水库，现在正在酷热暑天里赶修拦河坝。另外，上游在第一年工程完成的老王坡、吴宋湖、蛟停湖、潼湖四处湖泊蓄洪工程，本年度又曾加工整理，改善了进出口设备，疏浚了引洪道，加固了村庄围堤和整理了蓄洪区内部排水系统；中游也修成了濛河、瓦埠湖和花园湖三处湖泊洼地蓄洪工程。上述已修成的蓄洪工程加上第一年度修成的蓄洪工程，共可拦蓄淮河洪水一百亿立方公尺。在河道疏浚和整理方面：今年上游河南境内整理了洪河、汝河等淮河支流的河道；中游除疏浚了淮河各支流外（一年来，淮河支流经整理疏浚的共二十九条），并在蚌埠以东五河县境内举办了工程浩大的、使漴河等支流直接流入洪泽湖与淮河干流分流的工程。这个工程已切断洪泽湖以西的一段高地，开出了一条通洪泽湖的新引河，目前全部工程还没有完成，在工程完毕后沱河等支流就将和淮河干流分流。除此而外，在淮河下游的一个工程，也是第二年度中最主要的工程，就是西起洪泽湖东岸高良涧，东到海滨，长一百七十公里的苏北灌溉总渠。这个灌溉总渠在第二年度一年中已经基本上修成了。此外，淮河上、中、下游一年来共建造了二十多座涵闸。其中苏北灌溉总渠上的高良涧进水闸，是一个很大的水闸。
    第二年度治淮工程的规模比第一年大。仅土工方面，第一年除群众性农田水利工程外，完成约一亿公方，第二年完成一亿八千多万公方，超过第一年的百分之八十七。第二年的工程也比第一年更加艰巨。第一年工程中筑堤工程较多，第二年工程中绝大部分是疏浚河道和修建山谷水库等困难的工程。如五河县以下淮河干、支流分流工程中老龙潭工地上排除四公尺深的稀泥，所做一公方土工需要的劳力相当于筑堤工程的一倍；修建水库土坝和切岭等工程做一公方土所需的劳力，相当于筑堤工程的三倍。加之，去冬今春开始施工时，又不断遇到雨雪，使工程的进行受到严重阻碍。然而治淮民工和工人们发挥了高度的工作积极性和创造性，终于战胜万难，胜利完成了任务。
    目前，治淮工程除皖北佛子岭水库工程仍在继续施工之外，其余各地民工和工人已经复员。各级治淮机构正转入领导淮河的防汛工作；并将有计划地训练干部，开始着手进行第三年度治淮工程的各项准备。（新华社）
