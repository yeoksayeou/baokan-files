　　Party Organizations in Soviet Organs

　　The "Pravda" editorial on July 18, entitled "Party Organizations in Soviet Organs," is abstracted as follows:

　　The most important task of the Party organizations in Soviet organs is to constantly remember their responsibility in the Soviet organs, to make themselves guardians of the actual system of the organs, and to show Bolshevik-style uncompromisingness in the struggle against everything that may harm the interests of the state.

　　The correct selection and allocation of cadres is a necessary condition for improving the work of Soviet organs. The Party organization should strive to strictly abide by the Bolshevik principles of cadre selection—selecting cadres according to their political and professional characteristics—tirelessly improve education, ideologically temper cadres, and help them improve their professional skills.

　　However, it must be pointed out that the Party organizations of many organs pay little attention to the selection and allocation of cadres, and little attention to their political education and tempering. Due to insufficient attention to the selection of cadres, some unfamiliar and unexamined people have infiltrated some organs.

　　The work of the Party organizations in Soviet organs should always be within the sight of the Party's municipal and district committees and become the object of their constant concern. However, some Party municipal and district committees do not pay enough attention to the content of Party work in the organs and do not provide regular leadership to the Party organizations.

　　Insisting on improving the work of Soviet organs means: waging an uncompromising struggle against conservatism and bureaucracy, and carrying out daily organizational and educational work in the organs. The Party organization should tirelessly care about expanding the political horizons of Soviet civil servants, strive to make every staff member aware of their responsibility for the work they are responsible for, so that they can show Bolshevik principles and vigilance in their work, and take the interests of the state as the starting point when solving major and minor problems.

　　Holding regular Party member meetings is of great significance for improving the Party's organizational and political work in Soviet organs. These meetings should systematically discuss urgent issues in Party life and Party work in the organs, and more boldly unfold criticism and self-criticism.

　　Local Party organs should more deeply study and summarize the practical experience of Party organizations and give them regular assistance.

　　The Philosophy of Savages

　　The "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article by Shershenko on July 6, denouncing several arguments of the reactionary philosophy in the capitalist world today. The abstract is as follows:

　　The beastly appearance of American imperialism is well known. The United States is now the center of world reaction, a breeding ground for this ideology of hatred for mankind and open blackmail and obscurantist philosophy.

　　In order to blind the consciousness of the masses, poison them with drugs, make them disbelieve in a bright future, and weaken the masses' struggle for their rights, the big capitalists have mobilized all ideological tools, including loyal servants like modern bourgeois philosophy.

　　The philosophical views that dominate the United States and its vassal states—are despicable and dirty preachings of a new world war, justifications for unparalleled crimes, and the spread of barbaric cannibalistic ideas.

　　The premonition of the collapse of capitalism fills the hearts of its servants with terror. American fascist philosophers are wailing about the demise of all mankind and the abyss into which all mankind seems to be falling. They are also clamoring: Moving towards decline seems to be the basic law of social development. Imperialist ideologues are trying to portray the demise of the entire capitalist system as the total collapse of the world, as a return to the "Stone Age."

　　Many philosophical lackeys of capitalism admit that they cannot find a way out. Therefore, the argument of worshiping death is now very popular in American and British philosophical works. In the book "Decadent Small Talk" written by Sperland, which is selling well in England, he demands the restoration of the right to suicide.

　　These philosophers are trying their best to educate people with the slogan of "mutual destruction" to prepare for any adventures that are beneficial to the imperialists. Therefore, they of course densely cover up the doomsday not in front of all mankind, but in front of capitalism, and at the same time, they also densely cover up the fact that the destruction of capitalism and the victory of communism will prevent the death of hundreds of millions of people and open up an era of real happiness and real human life.

　　The old British philosopher Russell, a loyal servant of American imperialism, warned the world: "The end of human life, perhaps, the end of all organic life on our planet, is waiting for the world."

　　× × ×

　　However, many philosophical servants of imperialism, according to their claims, are looking for some other, more realistic ways to be saved. They believe that there is a way, and that the capitalist system can be saved, and that way is to establish a world empire under American rule! American philosophers shamelessly declare that a new world war is the only realistic way to seize world domination.

　　Eliminating all humanity in people, depriving people of their self-esteem, eliminating conscience, teaching people to become beasts, and arousing the most despicable and barbaric instincts in people—is the current task of the ideological lackeys of the imperialist elements.

　　Malcolm Sharp, a reactionary professor at the University of Chicago, wrote: "People always unconsciously love to dominate and fight." Trotskyist swindler Berhanm said: "The living embryo of war exists in everyone's blood, but political science has not yet invented any special medicine that can cure it."

　　Other disciples of human slaughter are trying to justify war by citing the will of God. They clamor that for the sake of the sacred religious spirit, a third world war is inevitable.

　　In fact, war and the preparation for war are the speculative business of the capitalists, the yeast that can make the military industry grow, and the income of the bosses of these military industries will increase as a result. The predatory war waged by the United States in Korea is a vivid example of this argument.

　　The Malthusian theory of defending war is now the most popular in the United States.

　　Modern American quack sociologists Foote, Binder, Cook, etc. have revived Malthus's delirium and made it serve the cannibalistic theory and practice of American monopoly capital. For example, Binder recently published a book in New York entitled "The Rampant Growth of Population," openly calling for reducing the earth's population by 700 million people. This cannibalistic number calls for eliminating one-third of mankind!

　　Imperialist elements are trying to use Malthus's ideas to prove to the masses that it is not capitalism, not the bloody exploiters who get rich by earning their labor, who should be blamed for the suffering of the masses, but they themselves—the working people who dare to have children and thus promote "overpopulation." Relying on Malthus's theory, they have formulated imperialist war as the law of human social existence.

　　Malthus's theory has long been theoretically exposed by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and at the same time, it has been practically overthrown in the process of communist construction in the Soviet Union. Under the conditions of socialist production relations, it is impossible to talk about any overpopulation, let alone any "superfluous" people.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    苏维埃机关的党组织
    “真理报”七月十八日社论，以“苏维埃机关的党组织”为题，摘要如下：
    苏维埃机关的党组织的最重要任务是：经常记住自己在苏维埃机关中的责任，使自己成为机关的实际制度的守护者，并对一切足以损害国家利益的事物的斗争表现布尔什维克式的不妥协性。
    正确地选拔和分配干部是改进苏维埃机关工作的必要条件。党组织应当为争取严格遵守布尔什维克选拔干部的原则——依照他们的政治和业务标志选拔干部——而斗争，应当不倦地改善教育工作，从思想上来锻炼干部，并帮助他们提高业务水平。
    但是，必须指出，很多机关的党组织很少注意选拔和分配干部的问题，很少注意他们的政治教育和锻炼。由于对干部的选择没有加以充分的注意，使一些陌生的、未经审查的人钻入了某些机关。
    苏维埃机关中党组织的工作应当经常在党的市委和区委的视野之内，并成为他们经常关怀的对象。但是，一些党的市委会和区委会对于机关中党的工作的内容却没有足够的注意，对党组织没有进行经常的领导。
    坚持改进苏维埃机关的工作是指：向守旧的和官僚主义的现象作不妥协的斗争，在机关中进行日常的组织和教育工作。党组织应当不倦地关怀扩大苏维埃公务人员的政治视野，努力使每一个工作人员都觉悟到自己对所负工作的责任，使他们能在工作中表现布尔什维克的原则性和警惕性，在解决大小问题时以国家利益为出发点。
    定期举行党员大会对于改进苏维埃机关中党的组织和政治工作有着重大的意义。在这些会议上应当有系统地讨论党生活中的迫切问题和机关中党的工作问题，更勇敢地展开批评和自我批评。
    地方党的机关应当更深刻地研究和综合党组织的工作实践，并给它们以经常的帮助。
    野蛮人的哲学
    “共青真理报”七月六日发表舍尔申科的论文指斥现在资本主义世界反动哲学的几种论调。摘要如下：
    美国帝国主义的野兽外貌是世所周知的，美国现在是世界反动派的中心，是憎恨人类的这种意识形态和公开的讹诈和蒙昧哲学的温床。
    为了蒙蔽群众的意识以毒物来麻醉群众，使他们不相信光明的前途，并削弱群众争取自己权利的斗争，大资本家们动员了一切思想工具，其中就有现代资产阶级哲学那样的忠实奴仆。
    统治着美国及其附庸国的哲学观点，——就是卑鄙龌龊的新世界战争的说教，就是对绝无仅有的罪行的辩护，就是野蛮食人思想的传播。
    对于资本主义的崩溃的预感，使它的奴仆们的心中充满了恐怖。美国法西斯哲学家们哀号着全人类的灭亡和全人类仿佛都要跌下去的那一个深渊，他们还叫嚣着：向衰亡迈进，仿佛就是社会发展的基本法则。帝国主义的思想家们企图把整个资本主义制度的灭亡说成世界的总崩溃，说成回到“石器时代”去。
    资本主义的许多哲学走狗们招认着他们找不到出路。因此，崇拜死亡的论调，现在在美、英哲学的作品中是很流行的。在英国盛销的斯伯兰所著的“颓废小言”一书，就要求恢复人的自杀权。
    这些哲学家尽力用“同归于尽”的口号教育人们准备任何有利于帝国主义者的冒险活动。因此，他们当然把不是在全人类面前，而是在资本主义面前的末日密密地遮盖起来，同时，也把资本主义的毁灭和共产主义的胜利会防止数万万人们的死亡，并打开真正幸福的，真正人类生活的纪元的这一个事实也密密地掩饰起来。
    美国帝国主义的忠实奴仆英国老哲学家罗素警告世界说：“人类生命的末日，也许，是我们地球上一切有机生命的末日，在等待着世界”。
    ×    ×    ×
    然而，帝国主义的许多哲学仆役，根据他们的说法，正在寻找其他一些，更现实的得救的办法。他们认为，办法并不是没有，而资本主义制度是能够拯救的，这办法就是要在美国统治下建立起一个世界帝国！美国的哲学家们厚颜无耻地宣称，新的世界战争是攫取世界统治权的唯一现实的办法。
    消灭人的一切人性，褫夺人的自尊心，消灭良心，把人教养成野兽，挑起人的最卑鄙的、最野蛮的本能——就是帝国主义分子的思想走狗当前的任务。
    芝加哥大学反动教授玛尔科里姆·沙尔甫写道：“人总是不自觉地爱好统治和打仗”。托洛茨基派骗子别尔汗姆说：“战争的活胚胎存在于每个人的血液中，但是政治科学还没有发明出什么特效药来能够医治它。”
    其他屠杀人类的门徒们力图引证上帝的意志为战争进行辩护。他们叫嚣着为了神圣的宗教精神，第三次世界大战是不可避免的。
    实际上，战争和对战争的准备，就是资本家们的投机商业，就是能够使军事工业增长起来的酵母，这些军事工业的老板们的收入会因而增加起来。美国在朝鲜所进行的掠夺战争就是这种论点的鲜明的例证。
    为战争辩护的马尔萨斯理论在美国现在最为流行。
    现代的美国冒牌社会学者佛特、宾得尔、库克等把马尔萨斯的谵语复活起来，并使其服务于美国垄断资本的食人的理论和实践。例如宾得尔不久以前在纽约出版的“人口放肆的增长”一书中，公开号召把地球的居民缩减七亿人口。这个食人生番号召把人类消灭三分之一！
    帝国主义分子企图以马尔萨斯的思想向群众证明，对于群众的苦难应负其咎的不是资本主义，不是赚取他们的劳动而致富的血腥的剥削者们，而是他们自己—敢于有孩子并且因而促使“人口过剩”的劳动人民。他们倚靠马尔萨斯的理论，便把帝国主义的战争制定为人类社会存在的法则。
    马尔萨斯的理论早已被马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林从理论上予以揭露，同时在苏联的共产主义建设过程中也从实际予以推翻了。在社会主义生产关系的条件下，既不可能谈到有任何人口过剩之说，更谈不到有任何“多余”的人。
