Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 27th. The British accomplice troops, who are pulling chestnuts out of the fire for American imperialism in Korea, have recently suffered greatly increased casualties. In June, British troop casualties were 106, but in July they suddenly increased more than threefold to 458. If the casualties of the Canadian troops are included, then this number would be even larger. This is the result of the American aggressors using them to exert so-called "military pressure" on the Korean and Chinese side.

Commonwealth Division Commander Cassels recently admitted that the Korean and Chinese side's artillery is "bigger, better, and often more accurate than before." He admitted that the Commonwealth forces had "quite a few casualties." He said: "Almost every day, we have casualties." Cassels did not have the courage to explain to the British people: what is the purpose of sending hundreds and thousands of British soldiers to the distant Korean battlefield, which has nothing to do with them, to die unjustly? But now, when more British soldiers are being sent to the front line as cannon fodder simply because the American government wants to detain 20 percent of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war and 68 percent of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, it is very clear that they are fighting for the interests of the American government.

The British government is still shamelessly defending the U.S. side's unreasonable demand for the forced retention of prisoners of war. It is neither thinking of the British soldiers captured by the Korean and Chinese side nor does it want to end the bloodshed of British soldiers. In its view, the dollar is clearly of higher value than the lives of British youth. It is very clear that if the British government continues to follow the U.S. policy, then as long as the American aggressors do not give up the demand for the forced retention of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, they will certainly continue to use British soldiers as tools of so-called "military pressure" and drive them to their deaths. The U.S. government has long complained that Britain only undertakes "smaller tasks" in the Korean War. Now that it is encountering greater casualties due to strengthening the so-called "military pressure," it will undoubtedly make Britain share a greater portion of these heavy casualties.

For those British soldiers who are forced to serve as cannon fodder for the American war of aggression, there is a way to save themselves. The 212 Dutch, Belgian, and French officers and soldiers who recently canceled their contracts with the American aggressors and returned from Korea are their example. Otherwise, they have at least one other way out, which is to surrender to the Korean and Chinese side on the front line.

### 美国侵略者驱策英国士兵为其卖命

    美国侵略者驱策英国士兵为其卖命
    【新华社开城二十七日电】在朝鲜替美帝国主义火中取栗的英国帮凶军队，最近伤亡大大增加了。在六月份，英国军队的伤亡是一百零六人，七月份就突然增加了三倍多，达到四百五十八人。如果把加拿大军队的伤亡算在里面，那末这个数字就还要大。这是美国侵略者拿他们来对朝中方面实行所谓“军事压力”的结果。
    英联邦师师长卡塞尔最近承认朝中方面的大炮“比以前更大，更好，而且使用起来常是更为准确”。他承认英联邦军队“有不少的伤亡”。他说：“差不多每天，我们都有伤亡。”卡塞尔没有胆量向英国人民说明：成百成千的英国士兵被送到与他们毫不相干的遥远的朝鲜战场上去冤枉地送命，究竟是为了什么？但是，在现在，当更多的英国士兵仅仅因为美国政府要扣留百分之二十的朝鲜人民军被俘人员与百分之六十八的中国人民志愿军被俘人员而被送上前线去当炮灰的时候，他们是在为美国政府的利益卖命的这一点，就显得十分清楚了。
    英国政府直到现在都还在替美方的强迫扣留战俘的无理主张进行无耻的辩护。它既不肯为被朝中方面俘掳的英国士兵着想，也不想终止英国士兵的流血。在它看来，美元显然比英国青年的生命有更高的价值。事情很明显，如果英国政府继续追随美国的政策，那末只要美国侵略者一天不放弃强迫扣留朝中战俘的要求，他们就一定还要把英国士兵当作所谓“军事压力”的工具，驱策他们去送死。美国政府早就埋怨英国在朝鲜战争中只担负“较少的任务”。它现在正因为加强所谓“军事压力”而遭遇更大的伤亡，无疑的，它将要把这种惨重的伤亡让英国较多地分担一份。
    对于那些被迫充当美国的侵略战争的炮灰的英国士兵，拯救自己的办法并不是没有的。最近取消了和美国侵略者所订的契约而从朝鲜返国的二百一十二名荷兰籍、比利时籍、法国籍的官兵，就是他们的榜样。要不然，他们至少还有一条出路，那就是在前线上向朝中方面投降。
