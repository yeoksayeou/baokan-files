    Jingxi Mining Bureau, Datai Mine Director Yuan Shixian Conducts Self-Criticism for Neglecting Safety in Production

    To the Editor: The People's Daily published the criticism from the Wanping County Federation of Trade Unions, Hebei Province, on July 18th, regarding our mine's negligence of safety in production. We believe this criticism is fundamentally correct. Our self-criticism is as follows:

    Indeed, there are significant problems in the safety work at our Datai Mine. The number of work-related injuries this year has increased significantly compared to last year. We should raise our vigilance and actively find ways to improve this situation. I myself have the erroneous thinking of "emphasizing production and de-emphasizing safety." Therefore, after several serious injuries occurred, I still did not promptly conduct strict inspections and take appropriate action. Now, in addition to actively improving safety work, I am willing to accept the punishment given to me by higher authorities.

    The reason for the accident at the Muchengjian mine shaft that killed worker Zhao Changhui was the negligence of the leadership and the lack of strict inspection and repair procedures. Because the coal chute had only been in use for two months, and two sixth-grade technicians were specially assigned to oversee it, we relaxed our attention to the safety of the chute. Although the wooden platform at the upper opening of the chute had been repaired several times in June, it was not carefully inspected, leading to the fatal accident. After the accident, the rescue methods were inappropriate, and the time was delayed for too long. At that time, the leading cadres were all holding a meeting at the Datai Mine (Muchengjian is about six or seven *li* from the Datai Mine) and did not arrive at the scene for rescue. These are all facts. As for the criticism that "the mine shaft platform was already rotten, and workers had made several rationalization proposals, but Director Yuan ignored them," this is not entirely consistent with the actual situation.

    The sanitation and welfare work at the Datai Mine's Muchengjian lags far behind the development of production and the demands of the masses. Welfare work has been minimal for nearly a year since work began. Muchengjian has not even thoroughly resolved the issue of a proper toilet. The main reason for this is our insufficient subjective effort. Otherwise, the situation would have been better. The Datai Mine has now begun to address the drinking water and toilet issues for workers.

    京西矿务局大台矿长袁士先检讨不重视安全生产的错误
    编辑同志：七月十八日人民日报登载了河北省宛平县总工会对我矿不重视安全生产问题的批评。我们认为这一批评基本上是对的。现检讨如下：
    我们大台矿的安全工作，确实存在着很大问题，今年工伤数字较去年增加很多，我们应该提高警惕并积极设法改善这一情况。我自己有着“重生产轻保安”的错误思想，因之，在发生几次重伤之后，我仍然没有及时严格检查处理。现在，我除了积极改进安全工作外，并愿接受上级给我的处分。
    木城涧井盘发生事故砸死工人赵长会的原因，是领导方面疏忽大意和检修制度不严格。因为放煤立眼刚刚使用两个月，并派有两个六级技术工人专门掌握，我们便放松了对立眼安全的注意。虽然六月份曾将立眼上口木盘修理过几次，但并未仔细检查，以致发生死亡事故。事故发生之后，抢救方法不当，时间又拖延太长，当时领导干部都在大台矿开会（木城涧距大台矿约六、七里），没有赶到现场抢救，这都是事实。至于批评中指出的“井盘已经腐烂，工人曾几次提出合理化建议，袁矿长置之不理”，这一点与实际情况是有出入的。
    大台矿木城涧的卫生福利工作，远远跟不上生产的发展和群众要求，开工将近一年之久，福利工作做的很少，甚至木城涧连一个正式厕所都没有彻底解决，其中主要原因，乃是我们主观上的努力不够，否则，情况也会要好一些。大台矿现在已经着手解决工人喝水和厕所问题。    袁士先
