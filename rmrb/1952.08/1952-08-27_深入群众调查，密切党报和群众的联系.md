    Deepen Mass Investigation, Strengthen the Ties Between Party Newspaper and the Masses
    Dong Qian

    The Party newspaper is an important tool for the Party to connect with the masses, educate the masses, and serve the masses. Therefore, the Party newspaper editorial department must regularly understand and concentrate the masses' opinions and requirements for the newspaper, and improve their work accordingly. In the past, Party newspapers in various places listened to the opinions of readers and correspondents from all aspects on the work of the newspaper through forums, which achieved certain results. Since the spring of this year, according to the opinions reflected by the masses, the People's Daily and some local newspapers have criticized the erroneous tendency of some cadres to neglect reading newspapers and not caring about newspaper distribution through local party committees and the "Letters from Readers" column, thereby promoting newspaper reading and distribution. At the same time, the opinions of the masses on the editing work of the newspaper often become an important driving force for the editorial department to overcome shortcomings and improve its work. Recently, the People's Daily and Shanxi Daily and others sent cadres to various places to conduct investigations among the masses, with great results.

    The characteristic of this investigation method is that it breaks through the narrow circle and can more widely absorb the opinions of the masses on the newspaper. The scope of the People's Daily investigation included cities (Taiyuan, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Guihua) and some rural areas (six villages) in Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces; interviewed party and government agencies, mass organizations, factories, schools, reading groups, and individual readers, and participated in 22 forums held by local party committees, taking a total of one month and four days. Shanxi Daily also sent three investigation teams (two in rural areas, one in factories) to conduct investigations among the broad masses of workers and peasants. Both the People's Daily and Shanxi Daily have collected many readers' opinions on the newspaper, which is of great reference value for the improvement of their work in all aspects.

    The main gain of this investigation by the People's Daily is, first of all, the discovery that the content and form of the newspaper are not yet suitable for the needs of the broad masses. Many cadres and the masses pointed out: The People's Daily has a "very great guiding role" for various tasks, but it is "too deep, can't understand it," "not easy to read, not easy to listen to." These opinions made the editorial department more keenly feel the necessity of improving this aspect of the work.

    The second problem discovered in this investigation by the People's Daily is that some units still have a serious tendency to not attach importance to reading newspapers. Although this erroneous tendency was criticized by some newspapers in the previous period, it has not been completely corrected in some units. For example, in the Yuci Prefectural Committee organs, 70 percent of the cadres do not read newspapers, and 30 percent do not read them regularly or only read the headlines. The Second District Committee of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, with more than 40 people, only subscribed to one copy of the People's Daily, and this copy was placed in the home of the district party committee secretary. This situation is not an isolated phenomenon. According to Sun Shiwei of the Guihua Hui Autonomous Region Government, some responsible cadres have the People's Daily to read (in fact, they don't read it much), so they don't care whether the lower-level cadres have newspapers to read. Therefore, many cadres regard reading the People's Daily as a "political treatment." The result of leading cadres not fully utilizing newspapers and not paying attention to cadres' reading of newspapers is that newspapers are divorced from the broad masses of cadres and cannot play their due role. Regarding this situation, Lenin criticized it 30 years ago, saying that "we are not yet good at utilizing the little things we already have." Lenin personally checked the distribution of subscribers to Pravda. However, many leading cadres in our units turn a blind eye to the above situation. This is a phenomenon that urgently needs to be corrected.

    The third problem discovered in this investigation is that among the postal cadres who are in charge of newspaper distribution, many still do not attach importance to newspaper distribution. Some even regard newspaper distribution as a "burden," and do not treat this work with a serious and responsible attitude, and lack initiative and enthusiasm. Therefore, some post offices are afraid of the newspaper editorial department checking their work. For example, the Taiyuan City Post Office wanted to establish a distribution network in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, but it has never been established. It was not until this issue was checked and resolved at this forum that they felt that the inspection by the newspaper editorial department was "beneficial without any harm" to their distribution work, and thus automatically reviewed the shortcomings in the distribution work.

    The above three problems discovered in this investigation are all related to a fundamental problem, that is, how can the Party newspaper closely connect with the masses? This proves that this method of conducting investigations among the masses has a great effect. The experience of Shanxi Daily also proves the great role of this investigation method. The opening of the road to popularization by the newspaper was realized through the investigation and research work among the masses last year. When the issue of popularization began to be raised, many comrades in the Shanxi Daily editorial department held a hesitant attitude towards this issue, always feeling that there was a lack of methods. Although the leadership repeatedly mobilized and explained, their thinking was always somewhat unclear. It was not until the Shanxi Daily editorial department sent people to conduct in-depth investigations among the masses, drafted a popularization plan, and set an example that the road to popularization was gradually opened. Under the guidance of this policy, and through the efforts of the editorial staff, Shanxi Daily has achieved remarkable achievements in popularization in the past year. According to the recent investigation results of the newspaper among cadres and the masses, Shanxi Daily is no longer the "not hitting the point, not rooted in the heart," "hard and astringent" of last year, but "grasped correctly, explained thoroughly." The relationship between Shanxi Daily and the masses is even closer. Workers said: "Workers subscribe to the newspaper, and production takes the lead." Model workers said: "Model workers and newspapers cannot be separated from each other." Cadres said: "When cadres encounter difficulties, they turn to the newspaper." After Shanxi Daily adopted the method of taking the mass line last year and opened the road to popularization, it decided this year to use this method to open the road to strengthening the ideology of the newspaper. Now the newspaper is continuing to improve its work based on the results of this investigation.

    The strength of the Party newspaper lies in the leadership of the Party and in the closest connection with the masses. Party newspapers in various places should absorb the above experience and thoroughly overcome the tendency of "running a newspaper behind closed doors."

### 深入群众调查，密切党报和群众的联系

    深入群众调查，密切党报和群众的联系
    董谦
    党报是党联系群众，教育群众，为群众服务的重要工具。因此党报编辑部必须经常了解和集中群众对报纸的意见和要求，据此来改进自己的工作。过去各地党报曾通过座谈会的方式，听取各方面读者和通讯员对报纸工作的意见，取得一定的成效。今春以来，人民日报和若干地方报纸根据群众所反映的意见，通过地方党委和报纸“读者来信”栏，批判了部分干部忽视读报、不关心报纸发行的错误倾向，从而推动了读报工作和报纸发行工作。同时群众对报纸编辑工作的意见，也经常成为编辑部克服缺点、改进工作的重要动力。最近人民日报和山西日报等派干部深入各地群众进行调查，收效很大。
    这种调查方法的特点，是突破了狭小的圈子，能够更广泛地吸取群众对报纸的意见。这次人民日报调查的范围，包括山西、察哈尔、绥远三省的城市（太原、大同、张家口、归绥）和部分农村（六个村子）；访问了党、政机关，群众团体，工厂，学校，读报组以及个别读者，参加了当地党委召开的座谈会二十二次，共费时一月零四天。山西日报也派出了三个考察组（农村二、工厂一），分别到广大工人、农民群众中进行考察。人民日报和山西日报都收集了许多读者对报纸的意见，这对于它们各方面工作的改进，有很大的参考价值。
    人民日报这次调查的主要收获，首先是发现了报纸的内容和形式，还不适合广大群众的需要。很多干部群众指出：人民日报对各项工作的“指导作用非常大”，就是“太深，看不懂”、“读也不好读，听也不好听”。这些意见使得编辑部更痛切地感觉到改进这方面的工作的必要性。
    人民日报这次调查所发现的第二个问题，就是有些单位仍然存在着不重视读报的严重倾向。这种错误的倾向，在前一个时期虽受到若干报纸的批判，但某些单位并未得到彻底纠正。例如在榆次地委机关中，干部不看报者即占百分之七十，不经常或只看大标题者占百分之三十。太原市中共第二区区委会四十多人只订了一份人民日报，而这一份报纸还是放在区委书记的家里。这种状况并不是个别的现象。据归绥市回民区政府孙世伟的反映，有些负责干部有了人民日报看（其实也不大看），就不关心下级干部有没有报看了。因此不少干部把看人民日报当作“政治待遇”。领导干部不充分利用报纸和不重视干部读报工作的结果，使报纸与广大干部群众脱节而不能发挥应有的作用。对于这种情况，列宁在三十年前就提出了批评，说“我们还不善于来利用我们已有的那一点东西”。列宁曾亲自检查过真理报订报人的分布情形。可是，我们不少单位的领导干部，却对上述情况熟视无睹。这是急应纠正的现象。
    这次调查所发现的第三个问题，就是在掌握报纸发行工作的邮局干部中，仍有不少人不重视报纸发行工作。有些甚至把报纸发行工作看成“负担”，不以认真负责的态度对待这一工作，缺乏积极性主动性。因此有些邮局就害怕报纸编辑部去检查他们的工作。例如太原市邮局，他们要在太原钢铁厂建立发行网，但始终没有建立起来。直到这次座谈会上检查了并解决了这一问题后，他们才感到报纸编辑部的检查，对于他们的发行工作是“有百利而无一害”，因而自动检讨了发行工作中的缺点。
    这次调查所发现的上述三个问题，都是关联到一个根本问题，即党报怎样才能密切联系群众的问题。这就证明了这种深入群众进行调查的方法，是有很大作用的。山西日报的经验，也证明了这一调查方法的重大作用。该报打开通俗化的道路，就是通过去年深入群众调查研究工作来实现的。当通俗化的问题开始提出时，山西日报编辑部不少同志对这一问题都抱犹豫的态度，总觉得缺少办法。虽经领导上再三动员解释，他们的思想总有些不通。直到该报编辑部派人深入群众调查，草拟出通俗化方案，作出榜样后，才逐渐打开通俗化的道路。在这一方针的指引下，经过编辑部人员的努力，一年来山西日报在通俗化方面已获得显著的成就。据该报最近在干部群众中的调查结果，山西日报已不是去年的“说不在点上，扎不在心上”、“又硬又涩”，而是“抓对了，说透了”。山西日报和群众的关系更加密切了。工人说：“工人订了报，生产打头炮。”劳动模范说：“劳动模范和报纸谁也离不了谁。”干部说：“干部遭了难，就把报纸翻。”山西日报去年采用走群众路线的办法，打开通俗化的道路后，今年又决定运用这一办法，去打开加强报纸思想性的道路。现在该报正依据这次调查的结果，继续改进着自己的工作。
    党报的力量就在于党的领导，在于与群众最密切的联系。各地党报应吸取上述经验，彻底克服“关门办报”的倾向。
