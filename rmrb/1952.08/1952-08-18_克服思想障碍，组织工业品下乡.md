Overcoming Ideological Obstacles, Organizing Industrial Products to Go to the Countryside
Yu Jie, Director of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Trade Department

The Significance of Industrial Products Going to the Countryside

This spring, due to everyone being busy with the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, coupled with the slow business season, material exchange was sluggish, and public and private factories accumulated large quantities of goods. To support production, the People's Government adopted methods such as processing, ordering, and cash purchases, absorbing a large amount of inventory to solve market difficulties. However, some primary markets, due to infrequent restocking over time, had dwindling inventories, creating a disconnect between urban and rural areas.

In the past three months, under the correct leadership of the People's Government, the market has gradually become active; the movement for increased production and thrift has been widely launched; new wheat has entered the market; wool from pastoral areas has been massively listed; and local products from various places are also facing the production season. These factors will greatly promote material exchange in the Northwest region. This also presents us with a new task in financial and economic work, which is to take immediate action and quickly organize a large number of industrial products to go to the countryside to meet the objective needs of industrial production and the increasing purchasing power of rural areas.

Overcoming Several Ideological Obstacles

Some people are very active in leading production movements, which is correct, but they feel that leading material exchange is irrelevant or not very important. This is a one-sided way of thinking, which in the end is detrimental to production. Stalin said in his "Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to the Seventeenth Party Congress": "In order to make the national economic life very active and to stimulate the continuous expansion of production in industry and agriculture, there must be another condition, and that condition is the expanded commodity circulation between cities and villages, between regions, between provinces, and between various departments of the national economy." At present, our basic economic situation is that industrial output has increased significantly compared to last year, and agricultural production continues to develop. If the issue of material exchange is not properly resolved, it will stagnate the national economy. Last year, we already gained a lot of experience in this regard. Because various regions attached importance to material exchange, it promoted market prosperity and helped the recovery and development of production. Therefore, people's governments at all levels must organize their forces well and concretely lead this work.

Some people view industrial products going to the countryside simply from the perspective of sales, which is also incomplete. To get industrial products into the hands of farmers, we must first buy back their agricultural and sideline products to revitalize rural finance. Therefore, the state-owned economy should effectively lead various economic components and do a good job in purchasing grain, wool, and other local products. The situation in the Northwest in June: in some areas, farmers had a reluctance to sell new wheat. For example, in major grain-producing areas such as Weinan, Dali, and Xianyang, the amount of wheat entering the market only accounted for about 50% of the same period last year. There were also some unreasonable aspects in the control of agricultural product prices. For example, in Ankang, Baihe, Shiquan, and Pingli in southern Shaanxi, the average market price of wheat on June 15 was 17% to 28% lower than the current sales price; in Ankang, the main local product, tung oil, was being purchased by private merchants at lower prices due to the failure of local state-owned trade to purchase it effectively, with market prices 14% lower than the official price. This is obviously detrimental to increasing farmers' purchasing power, and this situation must be reversed quickly, with a large amount of agricultural products purchased to create a prerequisite for industrial products to go to the countryside.

Some people believe that the consumption of industrial products in rural areas is not large and lack confidence in industrial products going to the countryside. This is an underestimation of farmers' purchasing power. According to the development of the rural economy, farmers' purchasing power has greatly improved compared to last year. For example, the Gangu Trade Branch Company in Gansu sold more than 62.9 million yuan of various industrial products in just two days at a local temple fair; the state-owned trade mobile team in Angla District, Qinghai, sold five bolts of cloth in a herder village in Maniduo Lang. In particular, farmers have a more urgent need for production materials such as plowshares, hoe blades, and wool shears, and there is still a phenomenon of not being able to buy them. In May, the Northwest Industrial Equipment Company sold 30 tons of pig iron, a raw material for manufacturing agricultural tools, to small iron factories in Weinan, Baoji, and other places alone; people in pastoral areas in Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Ningxia have written letters to trade companies reporting their difficulties in purchasing materials and requesting the company to conduct transactions. This shows that the rural market is very broad.

How to Organize Industrial Products to Go to the Countryside

First, state-owned economy must take the lead, organizing cooperatives and private businesses to take comprehensive action. Since July, the Northwest state-owned trade system has launched an increase production and thrift competition movement, vigorously promoting industrial products. What should be resolved now is to quickly make the cooperative system pay attention to promoting industrial products and further adjust public-private relations. The primary prerequisite for doing this work well is for state-owned trade departments to carefully implement commodity sorting and price inspection, so that inventory commodities are in order, distinguishing their performance and suitable seasons and regions to facilitate sales. It is also necessary to calculate reasonable regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences, taking into account the interests of production, transportation, and consumption, so that private merchants can make profits and give full play to their enthusiasm for operation.

Second, convene internal "exchange meetings" within the company, requiring each sales department to submit its own sales plan. This will communicate the situation between the various sales departments and the warehouse, so that the salesmen can understand their assets, and the allocation of goods can also be based on this. State-owned trade departments should also take the initiative to invite procurement personnel from cooperatives to visit warehouses, exchange information, simplify procedures, expand consignment sales, and be responsible for delivery, so that cooperatives can truly play their role as assistants. In addition, under the leadership of the industrial and commercial administrative departments, professional companies should take the lead in convening private business symposiums, introducing commodities, explaining policies, dispelling their ideological concerns, and striving to conclude cash transactions at the meeting as much as possible, and implement the spirit of wholesale as the mainstay.

Third, widely sign supply contracts. In order to give play to planning in business and reduce customers' purchasing procedures, fixed supply contracts should be signed with various agencies, schools, and groups. Fixed wholesale relationships should also be established with private businesses through various federations of industry and commerce and trade associations, so that businesses in large and small towns can play their role actively and serve the industrial products going to the countryside.

Fourth, restore and develop mule and horse fairs, medicinal material and local product fairs, and various ancient fairs in ethnic minority areas in a planned manner. The characteristic of rural commerce is that it is highly seasonal. These ancient fairs have played a great role in material exchange among the people in the past. For example, in Liquan, Shaanxi, the total value of transactions at one ancient fair reached as much as 4.4 billion yuan. When holding such ancient fairs, public and private businesses should be organized to bring goods to the fairs, and management should be strengthened to eliminate bad rules and evil habits. Experience has proven that this is an effective way to organize industrial products to go to the countryside.

Fifth, consolidate and expand mobile trade teams to conduct transactions in remote mountainous and pastoral areas. This method has gained a lot of experience in ethnic minority areas. State-owned trade organizations in Wuqi in northern Shaanxi and Qilian Mountains in Gansu also did it last winter and this spring. In the future, when conducting mobile trade, cooperatives and legitimate private businesses should be absorbed to participate with their own goods and ensure their reasonable profits, but the behavior of illegal private businesses cheating farmers and herdsmen must be prevented. Now, commerce is very backward in many mountainous and pastoral areas, and this mobile trade team is very suitable for the characteristics of sparsely populated areas.

Sixth, it must be recognized that promoting industrial products to go to the countryside is a concrete manifestation of serving the people. Therefore, all purely profit-seeking views should be overcome, so that goods are genuine and prices are fair, reasonable profits are obtained, and rural areas are faced, serving farmers and production. This is the path that all commerce should follow.

Finally, it should be especially pointed out that due to the development of industry, the variety of industrial products in our country is constantly increasing. Whether public or private businesses, they should eliminate the "famous brand" mentality and strengthen the promotion of goods with good quality that have not yet opened up sales channels. Otherwise, it will lead to some goods being in short supply and some goods being unsalable, which is detrimental to both material exchange and production.

The peak season for the autumn and winter markets is coming soon. Public and private businesses should act together and strive for greater national economic prosperity.

    克服思想障碍，组织工业品下乡
    西北军政委员会贸易部部长  喻杰
    工业品下乡的意义
    今年春天，由于大家忙于“三反”“五反”运动，又值商业淡季，物资交流欠畅，公私工厂积压了大批的商品。人民政府为了支持生产，曾采取加工、订货、现款收购等方法，大批吸纳存货，以解决市场的困难。而一些初级市场，由于日久进货甚少之故，存量见薄，形成城乡脱节现象。
    最近三个月来，在人民政府的正确领导下，市场逐渐趋向活跃；增产节约运动普遍开展；新麦已经登场；牧区羊毛大量上市；各地土产也面临产季；铁路交通迅速发展；这些将大大促进西北地区的物资交流。也给我们财经工作提出一个新的任务，就是立即行动起来，迅速组织工业品大量下乡，以适应工业生产的客观需要与农村购买力提高的要求。
    克服几种思想障碍
    有些人对于领导生产运动很积极，这是对的，但对于领导物资交流则感到无关紧要或不甚重要，这是一种片面的思想方法，其结果反而不利于生产。斯大林“在第十七次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”中说：“为要使全国经济生活十分活跃起来，而工业与农业又有不断扩大生产的刺激，那就还要有一个条件，这个条件就是城市与乡村间，区与区间，省与省间，国民经济各部门间的扩展的商品流转。”目前我们的经济基本情况，是工业产量较去年显著增加，农业生产继续发展，如果不很好地解决物资交流问题，将会使国民经济停滞。去年我们在这方面已经取得不少经验，由于各地重视了物资交流，因而促进了市场的繁荣，帮助了生产的恢复与发展。因此，各级人民政府必须很好地组织力量，具体地领导这一工作。
    有些人单纯从销售工作来看工业品下乡，这也是不全面的。我们要把工业品送到农民手中，必须先买回农民的农副产品，使农村的金融活泼起来。因此，国营经济应切实领导各种经济成分，做好粮食、羊毛等土产的收购工作。六月份西北的情况：有些地区农民对新麦存有惜售思想，如渭南、大荔、咸阳等主要粮食产地，上市量只占去年同期的百分之五十左右；在农产品价格掌握上，亦有些不合理的地方，如陕南安康、白河、石泉、平利六月十五日小麦市价平均低于现行出售牌价百分之十七至二十八；安康主要土产漆油，由于当地国营贸易收购不力，私商乘机压价收购，市价低于牌价百分之十四。这对于提高农民购买力显然是不利的，必须迅速扭转这一情况，大量收购农产品，为工业品下乡创造前提。
    有些人认为农村工业品的消费量不大，对工业品下乡缺乏信心。这是对农民购买力估计不足的说法。根据农村经济发展状况，农民购买力较去年大有提高，例如甘肃甘谷贸易支公司仅在当地一个古会上，两天即出售各种工业品六千二百九十余万元；青海昂拉区国营贸易流动小组，在马尼多浪的一个牧民村里，即售出大布五匹，特别是农民对于犁铧、砍土镘、羊毛剪子等生产资料，需要更为迫切，还有买不到的现象。西北工业器材公司五月份仅在渭南、宝鸡等地小型铁工厂，售出制造农具原料的生铁即达三十吨；青海、新疆、宁夏一些牧区人民，纷纷写信给贸易公司报告他们购买物资的困难，要求公司前往交易，可见农村市场是非常广阔的。
    如何组织工业品下乡
    首先，必须以国营经济为领导，组织合作社、私营商业，全面行动起来。西北国营贸易系统已自七月起掀起一个增产节约竞赛运动，大力推销工业品。目前应该解决的是迅速使合作社系统立即重视推销工业品，并进一步调整公私关系。做好这一工作的首要前提，是国营贸易部门认真执行商品排队与价格检查，使库存商品有条不紊，分清性能与适销季节、地区，便利销售。并要兼顾生产、贩运、消费三方面利益的原则，核算出合理的地区差价与批发零售差价，使私商有利可图，发挥他们经营的积极性。
    第二，召开公司内部“交流会议”，要求各销货部门提出自己的销货计划。以此沟通各个销售部门与仓库之间的情况，使销货员摸清家底，也可以使调拨商品有所依据。各级公司之间也可以互相交换本公司本地积压的存货。同时国营贸易部门应主动邀请合作社的采购人员参观仓库，互通行情，简化手续，扩大代销，负责送货，使合作社确实发挥其助手作用。此外，并应在工商行政部门领导下，以各专业公司为主，分别召开私商座谈会，介绍商品，讲明政策，打消其思想顾虑，尽可能争取在会议上现款成交，贯彻以批发为主的精神。
    第三，广泛订立供应合同。为了发挥业务中的计划性，减少顾主的购货手续，应与各机关、学校、团体订立固定供应合同。并通过各工商业联合会、行业公会与私营商业建立固定的批发关系，要使大、小城镇的商业都能发挥其积极性，为工业品下乡服务。
    第四，有计划地恢复与发展各地的骡马大会，药材土产大会及少数民族地区的各种古会。农村商业的特点，是具有很大季节性，这些古会过去在人民群众中都有很大的物资交流作用，例如陕西醴泉在
    一次古会上成交总值达四十四亿之多。在召开这样的古会时，应组织公私商业携带货物赶会，并加强管理，取缔陋规恶习。经验证明：这是组织工业品下乡的有效办法。
    第五，巩固与扩大流动贸易小组，深入山区牧区交易。这种方法在少数民族地区已经取得不少经验，陕北吴旗、甘肃祁连山区的国营贸易机构去冬今春也曾经做过，今后在进行流动贸易时，应吸收合作社及正当私商自带货物参加，保障其合理利润，但必须防止不法私商欺骗农牧民的行为。现在很多山区、牧区，商业非常落后，这种流动贸易小组很适合地广人稀的特点。
    第六，必须认识推动工业品下乡是为人民服务的具体表现。因此，应克服一切单纯营利观点，做到货真价实，取得合理利润，面向农村，为农民服务，为生产服务，这是一切商业应遵循的道路。
    最后，应该特别指出：由于工业的发展，我国工业品的品种不断增加，无论公私商业均应革除“名牌货”思想，对质量好而没有打开销路的商品要加强推销，否则就会形成部分商品供不应求，部分商品滞销，对物资交流和生产均为不利。
    秋冬市场旺季即将到来，公私商业一致行动起来，争取国家经济更加繁荣。
