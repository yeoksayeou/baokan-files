Zhao Jinli, Xu Jingzhang, Zhang Junxian, and other three mutual aid teams in Douma Township, Xingping County, Third District, Shaanxi Province, after achieving a bumper wheat harvest this year, and after deliberation and discussion, have jointly proposed a 1953 wheat high-yield plan. The plan is as follows:

The three groups will plant 171 mu of Hanping dry wheat, with an average yield of 330 jin per mu next year, an increase of 53.2% compared to this year. Among them, the high-yield land is 24 mu (8 mu per group), with a yield of 500 jin per mu. In addition, each group will plant one mu of high-yield wheat, with a yield of more than 680 jin.

In order to accomplish the above tasks, their specific measures are:

(1) All wheat fields will be plowed three times (the first and third times to a depth of 5 to 6 inches, the second time to a depth of more than 7 inches), and harrowed five times, rolled seven times, or rolled twice. Break up the soil clods when preparing the land. High-yield land will be plowed four times (the first and fourth times to a depth of 5 to 6 inches, the second time with a 7-inch plow, and the third time with a 7-inch plow or a double-set plow), harrowed six times, rolled seven times, or rolled twice. All wheat fields will be cleared of tiles once in the spring, dung balls will be broken up once, and weeding will be done twice, and weeds will be removed, and the first weeding will be followed by rolling once.

(2) 50% of the wheat fields will be fertilized with 50 jin of bone meal per mu as base fertilizer, and all wheat fields will be top-dressed with 5,000 jin of manure per mu in winter, and 15 to 20 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu in spring; high-yield land will be fertilized with 4,000 jin of manure and 70 jin of bone meal per mu as base fertilizer, top-dressed with 6,000 jin of manure in winter, supplemented with 3,600 jin of wall soil manure, and 30 jin of chemical fertilizer (applied twice) and 600 jin of wood ash.

(3) All wheat fields will be strip-sown with dense planting, with 13 to 15 jin of seeds per mu. The variety is the improved variety "Bima No. 1," and the seeds are selected with a fine selection machine. High-yield land will be entirely seed-selected, and all seeds will be soaked in warm water, treated with pesticides, and sown in a timely manner.

(4) Use pesticides and local methods to prevent insects, prevent frost by burning fires, and drive away geese every night to protect the growth of wheat seedlings.

(5) Carry out a fertilizer accumulation campaign, using methods such as frequently lining livestock pens, pigsties, and toilets, exchanging wall soil, kang soil, city wall soil, and green manure, and collecting human waste to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer. There are a total of 15 livestock, plus 2 small ones, each producing 4 carts of fertilizer per month, for a total of 68 carts per month. Eleven pigs produce 1 cart of fertilizer per month each, for a total of 11 carts per month. The 26 male and female toilets each produce 1.5 carts of fertilizer per month, for a total of 39 carts per month. Exchanging kang and wall soil accumulates 112 carts of fertilizer, and green manure accumulates 30 carts of fertilizer, for a total of 1,558 carts of fertilizer accumulated throughout the year.

(6) Continue to consolidate and improve mutual aid organizations, strengthen confidence in increasing production under patriotic education. Truly combine production with politics, culture, technology, sideline occupations, and supply and marketing. Each group subscribes to one newspaper, regularly studies politics and advanced agricultural experience and science and technology. One member of each group learns one character every day, and one member of each group will participate in an agricultural technology class this winter to learn simple agricultural techniques. This winter, engage in sideline oil extraction of 50 sets (each set can earn 50,000 yuan, for a total of 2.5 million yuan), and grind 40 shi (stone) of tofu (40 seats). Each seat can earn 7,000 yuan, for a total of 280,000 yuan. All profits will be used to purchase fertilizer to expand reproduction. Each group will sign a contract with the cooperative to guarantee the sale of agricultural and sideline products to the state.

    陕西兴平县窦马乡赵近礼等互助组订出丰产计划
    争取明年小麦比今年增产二分之一多
    陕西省兴平县第三区窦马乡赵近礼、许敬章、张俊先等三个互助组，在今年小麦获得丰产后，经过酝酿讨论，已联合提出一九五三年小麦丰产计划。计划如下：
    三个组共种旱平地正槎小麦一百七十一亩，明年每亩平均产量要达到三百三十市斤，比今年增产百分之五十三点二。其中丰产地二十四亩（每组八亩），每亩产量要达到五百市斤。另外每组各种高额丰产小麦一亩，产量要达到六百八十市斤以上。
    为了完成上述任务，他们的具体办法是：
    （一）所有麦田耕三次（一、三次各深五至六寸，第二次深七寸以上），作到耙五、耱七或碾二次。整地时打碎土块。丰产地耕四次（一、四次深至五寸到六寸，第二次用七吋步犁深耕一次，三次用七吋步犁或双套犁耕一次），耙六次、耱七次或碾二次。全部麦田开春拾瓦片一次，打粪蛋一次，细锄二次，并拔净杂草，锄第一次后碾一次。
    （二）百分之五十麦田，每亩上基肥骨粉五十斤，全部麦田冬季每亩上追肥圈粪五千斤，春季每亩上化学肥料十五斤至二十斤；丰产地每亩上基肥圈粪四千斤及骨粉七十斤，冬季施追肥圈粪六千斤，补上墙土粪三千六百斤，化学肥料三十斤（分两次上）、草木灰六百斤。
    （三）全部麦田实行条播密植，每亩播种十三至十五斤，品种是“碧蚂一号”良种，用精选机选种，高额丰产地全部粒选，全部种子用温汤浸种、药剂拌种、及时下种。
    （四）用药剂及土法防虫，放火防霜，每晚赶雁，保护麦苗生长。
    （五）开展积肥运动，用勤垫牲畜圈、猪圈、厕所，换墙土、炕土、城墙土、沤青肥，收集人粪尿等方法大量积肥。共有牲畜十五头，还有二头小的，每头每月积肥四车，每月共积肥六十八车。猪十一口，每月每口积肥一车，每月共积肥十一车。男女厕所共二十六个，每个每月积肥一车半，每月共积肥三十九车。换炕、墙积肥一百一十二车，沤青肥积肥三十车，共计全年积肥一千五百五十八车。
    （六）继续巩固与提高互助组织，在爱国主义教育下，加强增产信心。切实作到生产与政治、文化、技术、副业、供销相结合，每组订报一份，经常学习政治及先进农业经验与科学技术，每组组员每天识字一个，每组一人今冬参加农业技术班，学习简单农业技术。今冬搞副业榨油五十副（每副可赚五万元，共可赚二百五十万元），磨豆腐四市石
    （四十座）。每座可赚七千元，共赚二十八万元，所获利润全部购买肥料扩大再生产。各组与合作社订立合同，保证将农副业产品售给国家。
