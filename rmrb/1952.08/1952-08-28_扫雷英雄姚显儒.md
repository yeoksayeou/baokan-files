Minesweeping Hero Yao Xianru
    Li Rui

    I was in an exhibition hall, viewing various anti-personnel mines used by the enemy. The comrade responsible for the explanation said to me with a smile, "The American devils really played a lot of tricks on the Korean battlefield. Take disrupting our transportation lines, for example. They threw caltrops, timed bombs, butterfly bombs, cluster bombs, flares, flash bombs... but each and every 'magic weapon' was 'broken' by our soldiers. Many strange things were things our volunteer soldiers had never seen before, of course, and hadn't been pre-trained to deal with. However, our volunteer army is the people's army, an army educated by the Communist Party. They love the motherland, love peace, love the Korean people, and they hate the American bandits to the core. This strong love and hate makes our soldiers brave, makes them capable. No matter what 'modernized' thing the enemy comes up with, as soon as it appears, someone will step forward, dare to approach it, and subdue it. If the first person fails, the second person will continue, until success. Since the beginning of the positional warfare with the enemy, the soldiers have also encountered some 'new' things. The enemy laid a lot of barbed wire in front of their positions, buried a lot of landmines, like the platform mines that explode when you trip a wire, the bounding mines that explode one meter in the air, the hand-grab mines tied to trees that explode when you touch the tripwire, the aerial illumination mines that light up the position like snow after exploding... these things could scare people at first, but in a few days, these 'hieroglyphics' of the enemy were completely bankrupt again. To tell the truth, it's really a 'miracle' that those who punctured the mystery of these 'modernized technologies' were often not technical experts, but ordinary soldiers who had never learned any technology..."
    This is indeed the truth. Our minesweeping hero, first-class people's meritorious worker, recipient of the Second Class Soldier's Honor Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Comrade Yao Xianru, is one of thousands of such heroes.
    "Child, protect the people's country!"
    Comrade Yao Xianru is from Lingtai County, Gansu Province. He suffered the pain of oppression by the landlord class since he was a child. The Northwest is a region with vast land and sparse population, but he never had his own land since he was born. From the age of seven or eight, he herded sheep for the landlord's family. The landlord's sheep ate so well that they were fat and plump, while he was so hungry that he was skin and bones. He said: One year during the Spring Festival, the landlord's family wore fur coats, sat around the stove, guessing fingers and drinking wine, while he stood outside in thin clothes, serving them. His hands were frozen stiff, and he accidentally broke a wine glass from the landlord's family. The landlord raised his cane and beat him until his head was bleeding. Later, his father took him back to beg for a living. His mother, because she had not eaten for several days, picked a few handfuls of wild alfalfa leaves from the landlord's field to feed the livestock, and the landlord's family instigated a large group of vicious dogs to bite his mother half to death. When Comrade Yao Xianru mentioned the suffering he had endured since childhood, a fiery light of hatred flashed in his eyes.
    He barely managed to grow up and have some strength, and he was conscripted into the army by the Kuomintang. Ma Hongkui was a murderous demon in the Northwest, treating soldiers ten times more cruelly than cattle and horses. Speaking of this, Comrade Yao Xianru waved his hand and said, "I don't want to mention those sufferings anymore. It would take three days and three nights to tell them all. In a word, being a soldier in the old society was not a life fit for humans."
    In 1949, the Great Northwest was liberated. The sunlight shone on every suffering person, and Comrade Yao Xianru began to return to his own ranks. Everywhere, everything, moved him. He said: "The most unforgettable thing for me is when my father came to see me after the liberation. All the brothers and officers in the company treated him so warmly. This one brought water, that one offered cigarettes, the company commander and instructor personally accompanied the old man to eat, and sent him travel expenses before he left... it was really as warm as a family. But before liberation, my father also came to see me once, not to mention that no one entertained him, he couldn't even enter the gate. I secretly spoke a few words with him outside, hiding it from the 'higher-ups', and we each shed a few tears. My father ran from hundreds of miles away, and left without even drinking a cup of hot water."
    Comrade Yao Xianru will never forget what his father said to him when they parted:
    "Child! The days of suffering are over. The world has turned upside down, so protect the people's country firmly. We can't let those bad elements turn the tables and ride on our heads again."
    "I can't go back, I still want to come back!"
    After the national liberation, Comrade Yao Xianru put down his gun and picked up his shovel. They sang while reclaiming wasteland on Huanglong Mountain. They were determined to turn the barren mountains into fertile land and build the motherland into a peaceful and beautiful garden.
    However, the flames of war ignited by the American bandits in Korea raged and burned to the Yalu River. American bandits' planes frantically bombed Northeast China. Comrade Yao Xianru, although in the far Northwest, felt like his heart was burning with fire. He put down his shovel and wiped his gun until it was bright. He resolutely requested to volunteer to go to Korea. When he was approved and took the train from the Northwest to the Northeast, he, like thousands of volunteer soldiers, wished he could cross over to Korea in one step and immediately fight the enemy.
    When he arrived in Korea, it was the harsh winter of ice and snow. Carrying seventy or eighty pounds of gear, he successfully completed the thousand-mile march in the snow. Because he never fell behind, never complained, and also helped other comrades, and did mobilization work along the way, he was awarded a meritorious service at the award ceremony for the successful completion of the march.
    The opportunity to kill the enemy finally arrived. The Fifth Campaign began. He and other comrades, like tigers coming out of the mountains, rows of sharp knives, pierced the heart of the enemy's position. They carried fried noodles, climbed several high mountains overnight, drank some rainwater when thirsty, and fell asleep in the rain when tired, but their spirit was very strong. He had only one thought in his mind: "Hurry up and intercept a batch of devils, hurry up and capture a group of prisoners."
    But, how unfortunate, a shrapnel from an enemy bomb injured his left foot on the march to the enemy's deep.
    When the superior ordered him to go down for recuperation, and the stretcher team was about to lift him onto the stretcher, he refused to go down at all costs. He struggled off the stretcher, and he asked to be allowed to follow the team slowly. But an order is an order, and an order must be absolutely obeyed. Finally, with tears in his eyes, he lay on the stretcher. But his heart was still following his comrades forward. On the stretcher, he cursed the enemy, shouting: "I can't go back to the motherland, I still want to come back!" The pain of the wound made him dizzy for a while, and then he woke up again. In his sleep, he was still with his comrades, charging towards the enemy. When he woke up, he found himself lying on the stretcher.
    "Avenge our family!"
    It was drizzling, and their stretcher team walked all night. At dawn, they arrived near Jiuhua Village. The stretcher squad leader placed them in the homes of nearby Korean villagers.
    The landlord was an old woman in her fifties or sixties, with hair already graying. This Korean old mother was very enthusiastic. As soon as she saw them, she personally ran up to help him onto the kang in the house, boiled water for him, and personally washed his face. She stroked his wound, and tears flowed in her eyes. She gestured, telling Comrade Yao Xianru: Her husband was a member of the Labor Party, and was killed by the American-Li bandits during the retreat of the People's Army. His son is now in the People's Army, fighting the enemy on the front lines. Living with her were only three daughters, the eldest sixteen years old, the second fourteen, and the youngest only twelve. She said, "When I see every volunteer soldier, it's like seeing my own son. When I see every wounded volunteer soldier, it's like seeing my own son injured..." As she spoke, she asked her daughter to cook for them. The three little girls also busied themselves with their mother, taking care of them.
    After a while, the old woman told them that in recent days, many villages in the vicinity had been hit by the devils' planes. In order to prevent accidents, it was best to take him to the cave above to rest. After she finished speaking, she and the stretcher squad leader helped Comrade Yao Xianru and placed him in the cave on the hillside. After a while, the old woman climbed up the mountain again, carrying a large wooden box of things, inside which were fragrant rice porridge, sauerkraut, and malt candy. The old woman served them bowl by bowl, and personally fed Comrade Yao Xianru. He and the stretcher squad leader were so moved that they shed tears.
    Before they had finished eating, the enemy's plane suddenly arrived. The old woman was worried about her three daughters at the foot of the mountain, so she hurried home. The stretcher squad leader also ran out right behind her. They had just left the cave when Yao Xianru heard the sound of a fire bomb exploding. Then thick smoke billowed up, and the house at the foot of the mountain was already on fire. At this time, where could Comrade Yao Xianru lie quietly! He ignored his pain and climbed down the mountain with difficulty. When he climbed down the mountain, the house where they had just rested was burning fiercely. The two older daughters had already been rescued from the fire, but they were burned all over. The twelve-year-old youngest daughter, burned beyond recognition, lay on the ground to the side, already dead. At this time, the old woman seemed completely insane. She would pounce on the body of her dead youngest daughter; then she would pounce on the burning house; then she would stretch out her hands, her eyes staring straight ahead, shouting loudly, running wildly towards the road, meaning to fight the American devils. The burned daughter stood aside blankly, without tears. The stretcher squad leader desperately pulled the old woman, not letting her pounce into the fire, but he couldn't hold her alone. At this time, Comrade Yao Xianru completely forgot his injuries and climbed forward to help the stretcher squad leader hold the old woman. He shouted:
    "Mother! With me here, I am your son, I will definitely avenge you!..." When the old woman saw Comrade Yao Xianru, whose legs were bleeding, climbing down the mountain, she seemed to wake up, no longer pouncing into the fire, and hugged his head and cried.
    One day, the old woman spent in the cave, crying, cursing, telling! Thousands of words always came down to two sentences:
    "Child! Avenge this blood feud for us!" "Don't worry, Mother! I will definitely avenge you!"
    In the evening, their stretcher left Jiuhua Village. The old woman and her second daughter sent them four or five miles. On a small hilltop, the old woman stood there blankly, watching their stretcher walk into the open space at the foot of the mountain. A mile or two away, Comrade Yao Xianru turned his head on the stretcher, and the Korean old mother was still standing on the hillside, waving to them.
    All the way back to the motherland. As soon as Comrade Yao Xianru closed his eyes, he saw the Korean old mother, the wind blowing her white hair, waving to him on the hilltop; as soon as he closed his eyes, he heard the Korean old mother's voice: "Avenge us, avenge us!"
    "I am a soldier, hurry back to the front!"
    "When the volunteer soldiers returned to the motherland, it was like an injured child returning to the arms of its mother, feeling warmth everywhere. At the station, people welcomed us in droves.慰问队 (comfort teams) shuttled like sparrows, one leaving and another coming. Women voluntarily organized to wash our clothes, and elementary school students stood in front of us holding flowers and shouting 'Volunteer Soldier Uncle'.... But the warmer the motherland, the less I could stay. I am a soldier, and I have not fulfilled my responsibility. I had only one thought: heal quickly, hurry back to the front!"
    "Everyone in the hospital took care of us so thoughtfully. The nurses rotated and constantly served by the bed, even more thoughtfully than family members. But the more thoughtful they were, the less I could stay. I am a soldier, and I have not completed my responsibility. I had only one thought: get well quickly, hurry back to the front!"
    "Every day I heard new news of the motherland's construction from the newspaper. Every day, new labor heroes created models. But the more good news there was, the less I could stay. I am a soldier, and I have not completed my responsibility. I had only one thought: heal quickly, hurry back to the front!"
    The above is Comrade Yao Xianru's state of mind when he was in the hospital. So after the surgery, when the wound had just healed, and there was still a big lump, he decided to be discharged. The doctor couldn't resist his repeated requests, and finally sighed, shook his hand tightly, and issued a certificate allowing him to be discharged.
    When he arrived at the convalescent regiment, he wished he could fly across the river, but things were not so convenient. The batch that was about to leave was already full, and he had to wait from the beginning. Yao Xianru said, "Wouldn't this make a person's hair turn white in anxiety?" He pleaded with the person in charge until his mouth was dry and his tongue was parched. Finally, the comrade in charge of repatriation in the regiment was moved by him and finally agreed to let him leave with this batch.
    He followed the original road, looking for his own unit. He longed to see his old chief and old comrades soon. He also longed to see the Korean mother again. When he passed through Jiuhua Village again at night, he hoped to find those remaining houses. But when he was injured and came back, he was lying on a stretcher, traveling at night, and it was raining, so he couldn't remember exactly where it was. Moreover, after these few months, many Korean villages had only names left. He finally didn't find where the old mother was. He stood for a while on the ruins of the village overgrown with weeds, and then strode forward, saying to himself, whether or not he saw the Korean old mother, it was the same, the main thing was to remember what she told him: "Avenge our family!"
    "Can't I provoke you? I'm going to provoke you!"
    When Comrade Yao Xianru first came back, their unit was in the second line, and he looked forward to being sent to the first line day and night. This opportunity finally came, and they accepted the task of defending Kaesong.
    He, like tens of thousands of other soldiers, saw the hydrogen balloons and searchlights in the sky above Panmunjom with his own eyes, and he also saw with his own eyes the enemy bombing the neutral zone, bombing Korean civilians to death, and killing Martyr Yao Qingxiang... all kinds of facts of undermining the negotiations. He also knew that the enemy openly proposed to take Kaesong, and the enemy said shamelessly at the meeting: "Let the planes and cannons talk to you." In Comrade Yao Xianru's own words, "It really made my lungs explode with anger."
    The soldiers' desire for battle was very high, and letters of determination requesting to attack the enemy were sent to the company headquarters like snowflakes. But under the education of the superiors, he established the idea of prolonged combat. He and all the soldiers in the class worked day and night to build fortifications, turning the hard rock into steel-like tunnels. At night, they constantly went out to ambush the enemy, constantly taking small groups forward to observe the terrain near the enemy's outpost positions. Twenty meters tonight, fifty meters tomorrow night, the further they went, the more skilled they became, the bolder they became. They were already very close to the enemy's front line of positions.
    When they took over, friendly troops had told them that there were many landmines in the enemy's positions. A few days before, a comrade who went out to reconnoiter was injured by a mine. So, when their group set off again one night to carry out a mission, the instructor instructed him: "Be careful of the enemy's landmines." Comrade Yao Xianru said, "Don't worry, instructor!" and set off like a gust of wind with the two young soldiers in the class - Zhang Zhenjiang and Luo Zhaocai.
    It was pitch black, but they had already become familiar with this area. They advanced quickly and quietly. Crossing the traffic trench, climbing over the small hill, crossing the ridges of the rice fields, wading through the small river at the foot of the mountain... Later, they were getting closer and closer to the enemy's position. The terrain could only be seen clearly at dawn, so they lay in the bushes, fully camouflaged. At dawn, they parted the trees and quietly explored forward. Sometimes they advanced stooping, sometimes they crawled on the ground.
    In a hillside overgrown with various weeds and small trees, just as Yao Xianru stepped over his left foot, he discovered a thin iron wire blocking his right foot in front of him. He looked left and right and realized that not far from him, there was a square thing. He thought, "Is this a landmine?" and immediately felt nervous. He waved to the comrades behind him and said softly, "We may have found a landmine! You stand back a little!" He then carefully walked to the front of the square thing and squatted down. Upon closer inspection, there was something protruding a few inches long on it. On that thing, several yellow-earth-colored iron wires, no thicker than hair, were stretched horizontally or diagonally. It could be determined that this was the enemy's landmine.
    Comrade Yao Xianru squatted there, staring fiercely at that strange thing. He remembered that the comrade who had come out for reconnaissance the previous week had been killed by this monster. He said in his heart, "What a vicious thing! You want to kill me, Yao Xianru? I won't trip your wire, I won't provoke you, let's see what you can do to me?" Thinking this, he carefully stepped over the wire, preparing to call the soldiers in the group to go around like this to continue moving forward.
    But, just as he passed, he suddenly thought, "No, if I go around like this, other comrades will come to reconnoiter or ambush at night, and if they are not careful, won't they still get hurt?" He decided to make a mark there and tell everyone when he got back. Thinking this, he took out a propaganda leaflet from his pocket and hung it on the small tree branch near the landmine. The meaning was to wait until he came back and everyone would discuss a solution.
    But he thought again, "This is still not right, what if someone else passes by here before I get back? Leaving this thing here is always a disaster." He decided to destroy it. He ran back to inform his young comrade Zhang Zhenjiang to bring the grass rope from the nearby rice field. He said, "We tie the rope to the wire, and pull it four or five meters away, the mine will explode, and we won't be in danger."
    Zhang Zhenjiang and Luo Zhaocai both advised him, "We don't understand this thing, so it's best not to provoke it easily. This is right in front of the enemy's position, and it's daytime. If it explodes, exposing our target, and the enemy starts shelling, wouldn't we not be able to complete the task of observing the terrain?"
    Yao Xianru felt that what they said made sense, but his heart was burning with anxiety. He thought that this was just the first landmine encountered, and there were many, many more of these things in the enemy's position. Could he let this square monster block the way forward? Many past events also rushed to his mind at this time. He thought of the suffering he had endured in the old society, the father's instructions to him after liberation, and the Korean old mother's voice of "Avenge me"... His blood boiled.
    He remembered the usual education of the superior party: "A communist is not bowing his head to difficulties, good party members not only do not evade difficulties, but also should go to the difficulties, overcome difficulties..." He thought of the hero of the army, first-class meritorious Liu Guangzi, in the Fifth Campaign, more than a hundred British devils surrounded him to capture him alive, but he was not afraid, not afraid of death, bravely counterattacked, and as a result, he captured sixty-three devils alone; he thought of the model party member of the army Li Bingqun, who, after exhausting the last bullet and killing a large number of enemies, had no way to retreat in all directions, and led all eight comrades in the class to jump off the cliff. He quietly said to himself: "Liu Guangzi can capture sixty-three devils alone, can't I, Yao Xianru, subdue this monster lying on the ground that can't move? Bah; dare not provoke you? What kind of man-eating dragon or fierce tiger are you? Today, I have to provoke you!"
    He stood up suddenly, and tightly held the hands of comrades Zhang Zhenjiang and Luo Zhaocai and said: "Young brothers! You retreat, take cover in the traffic trench, and monitor the enemy. I want to try this monster. You pay attention to my movements in the back, if it is successful, we all learn to sweep mines, and we will pull out the scorpion's tail of the enemy from now on, and we will open the way whether it is reconnaissance or attack;... If I sacrifice, you pay attention to how my actions make it sound, leaving an experience for future research. Anyway, sooner or later, we have to break this thing, you do it, I do it, he does it is the same." After saying that, without listening to the dissuasion of the two of them, he strode closer to the landmine again.
    He squatted by the landmine, thought about it, this mine will sound when tripped, first cut off the wire, then he bent down, and with a click, he bit the thin iron wire off with his teeth. After all three lines were bitten off, he dug out the entire mine along the four sides, held it in both hands, and turned to walk back.
    He also knew that biting off the wire was not the end of the matter, because he heard that another comrade from another company the week before had broken the wire, and then in a panic while holding it back, the mine fell to the ground and exploded, injuring that person. He calmly walked back to his traffic trench, then gently put it down and placed it on the edge of the traffic trench. He stood inside the traffic trench, and outside this traffic trench was a slope.
    He began to disassemble the cap and the blasting cap on the top. He told Zhang Zhenjiang and them that he was rotating from left to right, please pay attention. At this time, all his attention was focused on this small protruding thing. He had seen the explosion of the grenade, and he had countless times picked up the enemy's unexploded grenades and thrown them back to the enemy. Therefore, he naively thought: staring at it without blinking, if the dog days have a smoky look to explode, then he will lift it to the slope outside the traffic trench. But everything went smoothly, and the protruding little thing, the cap and the blasting cap, separated from the mine body below in his hand.
    The distance to "success" was so far and so near, so thrilling and so ordinary. The key lies in the first person's first determination and courage. In essence, Comrade Yao Xianru has already succeeded. But he could not be sure whether the monster has been controlled. He does not despise the enemy who has already been defeated in his hands. He picked it up, and forcefully throw it down the slope outside the trench, and when it was about to hit the ground, he bent over in the trench. He heard a "thud", this guy, made a sparse sound like a stone falling. It told Yao Xianru and Zhang Zhenjiang that the test was successful.
    "Yeah! Success, success, squad leader!" Zhang Zhenjiang and Luo Zhaocai ran over, patting his shoulders and becoming happy changing their voices. Comrade Yao Xianru also smiled, he had many happy things in his life, but it seems that none of them laughed so pleasantly this time.
    A person's interest is always particularly high for newly learned things, Yao Xianru did not rest for a minute, then patted his comrades on the shoulders, and said excitedly: "You cover me here, I will go and take a few 'tiger dolls' back." Then, he climbed forward again. Within ten minutes, he brought back ten platform mines, in addition, there were three illumination mines.
    Young people lack the patience to wait, Zhang Zhenjiang asked the squad leader to teach him immediately. Right next to the traffic trench, within a few minutes, Zhang Zhenjiang also
    "Graduated." "Squad leader! You cover me, let me also pick a few big melons back!" The young man said and ran out, and soon brought back three platform mines.
    In this way, the enemy's "magic weapons" shipped across the ocean, boasting "modernization," like the monsters that appeared in the Chinese old novel "Investiture of the Gods", were completely bankrupt in front of our ordinary soldiers.
    Front Line Landmine Relocation
    Comrade Yao Xianru became busier from now on, and he had one more job. He did not want to delay his work, so he used his rest time to teach the other comrades. After learning, they practiced on their own positions. He reassembled the mine, put it in a certain position, and the newly learned comrades took it down one by one. In order to prevent accidents and injuries, he quietly installed a safety pin on it beforehand, and stood aside to carefully check their actions. The learners did not know, so they were very serious and careful, he knew in his heart that the insurance would not hurt people during the practice.
    Soon, everyone learned. The regiment, the division, the nearby friendly troops, all invited him to spread the experience. Like sowing seeds, his experience became the experience of thousands of people, and his wisdom became the wisdom of thousands of people. In the dissemination, practice, and technical experience continues to develop. Naturally, in other troops, on other battle lines, minesweeping heroes like Yao Xianru also emerged, and in a short period of time, a "landmine relocation" movement was launched on the wide battle line. The various mines buried by the enemy in their front line positions the first night were carried back by our soldiers the next day. At first, the foolish enemy had no idea of this. When they were still relying on their landmines to be their watchdog, our soldiers had already rushed into their positions, and many enemies were captured without even having time to put on their shoes.
    Only when it started, these mines only helped us add some explosives, and help us dig trenches and fortifications, but it became more and more, our soldiers felt it was too wasteful to use it as explosives, and then they reassembled it and buried it in our position, letting these American-made landmines, waiting for their own master. Many enemies were blown to pieces in an attempt to sneak into our positions. Every soldier knows, "What the enemy has, he is most afraid of," because their leaders, their newspapers, are talking about the power of those things all day long.
    However, just this cannot satisfy our soldiers. They go one step further, climb to the enemy's position at night, remove their mines, and bury them in their position. The mines are still their mines, but the difference is that the buried place has changed, the mark has been changed, and the installation method has changed. In this way, during the day and night, on the enemy's position, there is often a sudden explosion. The enemy did not like these sounds, because these killing weapons they made, they shipped, and they buried underground, exploded not others, but themselves.

    扫雷英雄姚显儒
    李蕤
    我在一个陈列室里，参观了敌人的副防御工事各种地雷以后，一个负责讲解的同志笑着向我说：“美国鬼子在朝鲜战场上，确实玩了不少的鬼名堂。以破坏我们的交通线来说吧，三角钉也掷过，定时炸弹也掷过，什么蝴蝶弹子母弹也掷过，照明弹闪光弹也掷过，但是，一件一件‘法宝’，都被咱们的战士给‘破’了。有许多古怪的东西，确实是我们志愿军战士过去没有看见过的，当然也没有预先学习过对付它的办法。可是，咱们的志愿军，是人民的部队，是共产党教育着的部队，他们热爱祖国，热爱和平，热爱朝鲜人民，他们恨透了美国强盗。这个强烈的爱和恨，使我们的战士，成为勇敢的人，有本领的人，不论敌人什么‘近代化’的东西，只要一出现，便有人挺身出来，敢于去接近它，制服它，第一个人万一失败了，就有第二个人继续做，一直到成功为止。自从和敌人打阵地战以来，战士们也碰到一些‘新’东西，敌人在他们的阵地前面，敷设了许多铁丝网，埋了许多地雷，像今天咱们看的什么脚一绊线就爆炸的平台雷呀，跳一公尺高才爆炸的跳雷呀，绑在树上的、手一攀着绊丝就炸的手攀雷呀，爆炸后把阵地照得雪亮的空中照明雷呀……，这些东西，在最初是也能吓吓人的，但是，不要几天，敌人这些‘鬼画符’就又完全破产了。要说起来，也真是‘奇迹’，戳破敌人这些‘近代化技术’的神秘的，往往并不是什么技术专家，而是并没学过技术的普通战士，……。”
    这话是确实的。我们的扫雷英雄，一等人民功臣、荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国战士荣誉二级勋章的姚显儒同志，就是千百个这样英雄里的一个。
    “孩子，好好把人民江山保牢稳！”
    姚显儒同志，是甘肃省灵台县人。他从小就受尽了地主阶级压迫的痛苦。西北是地广人稀的地区，但他却一生下来就没有自己的土地。他七八岁起，就给地主家放羊，地主家的羊吃得又肥又胖，他却饿得骨瘦如柴。他说：有一年过年，地主一家人穿着皮袄，围着火炉，猜拳喝酒，自己穿着单衣在门外站着伺候，手冻硬了，一不小心，打碎了地主家
    一只酒盅，地主就举起手杖，把他打得头破血流。后来父亲就把他领回去，讨饭过日子。他的母亲因为几天没吃饭，在地主的田边揪了几把人家喂牲口的野苜蓿叶子，地主家的人就嗾出一大群恶狗，把他母亲咬个半死。提到从小受的苦处，姚显儒同志眼睛里就闪出仇恨的火光。
    好容易熬得成人，有了一把力气，他就被国民党抓去填了兵。马鸿逵是西北的杀人魔王，对待兵比对待牛马还残忍十倍。谈到这些，姚显儒同志挥挥手说：“这些苦楚，都不愿再提，要说起来，三天三夜也说不完的。一句话，在旧社会当兵，那根本不是人过的日子。”
    一九四九年，大西北解放了。太阳光照到每一个受苦人的身上，姚显儒同志开始回到自己的队伍里来。处处，事事，都使他受到感动。他说：“最使我难忘的，是解放后我的父亲来看我，全连的弟兄，长官，都那么亲热地招待他，这个送水，那个拿烟，连长指导员亲自陪老人家吃饭，临走送路费……，真是亲热得好像一家人。可是，解放前呢，我爹也来看过我一次，别说没人招待，连门也进不来呀。还是瞒着‘上边’，偷偷地在外面说了几句话，每人掉了几滴眼泪。父亲从几百里外跑来，连口热水也没喝就走了。”
    姚显儒同志永难忘掉父亲和他分别时说的话：
    “孩子！苦日子到了头了。世界翻过来了，好好地把人民江山保牢稳，可不能让那些坏东西们再反过手来，再骑在咱们的头上。”
    “我不能回去，我还要回来！”
    全国解放以后，姚显儒同志放下了枪，背起了铁锹。他们在黄龙山一边唱歌，一边开荒。他们决心要把荒山都开成肥沃的土地，把祖国建设成和平美丽的大花园。
    但是，美国强盗，在朝鲜烧起的战火，烈焰滚滚，烧到了鸭绿江边。美国强盗的飞机，疯狂地轰炸我国东北。姚显儒同志虽然在远远的西北，但心里就像被烈火烧着一样，他放下铁锹，又把枪擦得雪亮。他坚决请求志愿赴朝。当他获得批准，坐着火车，从西北向东北前进的时候，他和千万个志愿军战士一样，恨不得一步跨到朝鲜，立刻去打敌人。
    他到朝鲜的时候，正是冰天雪地的严冬。他背着七八十斤重的东西，胜利地完成了千里雪地行军。因为他从来不掉队，不叫苦，还帮助别的战友，沿途做鼓动工作，在胜利完成行军的评功会上，他被评上了功。
    好容易等到了杀敌的机会，五次战役开始了，他和别的战友们一道，像出山的猛虎一样，一排排的尖刀，插向敌人阵地的心脏。他们背着炒面，一夜爬几道高山，渴了就接些雨水喝喝，累了就躺在雨里睡一觉，但他们的精神十分旺盛，他心里只有一个念头：“赶快截住一批鬼子，赶快活捉一群俘虏。”
    但是，多么不幸，在插向敌人纵深的行军道上，敌人的炸弹碎片炸伤了他的左脚。
    当上级命令他下去休养，担架队把他往担架上抬的时候，他死活不肯下去，他从担架上挣扎下来，他请求准许他慢慢跟着队伍走。但命令是命令，命令是要绝对服从的，最后他噙着眼泪，躺上担架。但他的心，却还跟着战友们前进。他在担架上破口大骂着敌人，他高喊着：“我不能回祖国去，我还要回来！”伤口的疼痛，使他一阵昏昏迷迷，忽然又清醒过来，睡梦中他还和战友们在一道，在向敌人冲杀。醒来了，他却发现自己是躺在担架上。
    “替我们一家人报仇！”
    天下着小雨，他们的担架走了一夜，黎明的时候，到了九化里附近。担架班长把他们安置到附近朝鲜老乡的家里。
    房东是一个五六十岁的老太太，头发已经花白了。这个朝鲜老妈妈十分热情，一看到他们，便亲自跑上来，把他搀扶到屋子里的炕上，给他烧水，亲自替他洗脸。她抚摸他的伤口，眼里流下眼泪。她用手比划着，告诉姚显儒同志：她的丈夫是劳动党的党员，在人民军后退时期，被美李匪军杀死了。他的儿子，现在人民军，正在前线和敌人作战。和她在一起生活的，只有三个女儿，大的十六岁，第二个十四岁，最小的才十二岁。她说：“我看见每一个志愿军，就像看见自己的儿子，看到志愿军的每一个伤员，就像看到自己的儿子受伤……。”一边说一边就叫她的女儿替他们做饭，三个小姑娘也和妈妈一道忙来忙去，照顾他们。
    过了一会，老太太告诉他们，最近几天，附近的许多村庄都被鬼子的飞机打着了。为了防备意外，最好把他领到上面的山洞里休息。说完以后，她就和担架班长搀扶着姚显儒同志，把他安置到半山坡的洞子里。过了一会，老太太又顶着一大木盒东西，爬上山来，里面是香喷喷的香稻米粥、酸菜、麦饴糖。老太太一碗一碗给他们盛，并且亲自喂姚显儒同志，他和担架班长都感动得流下了眼泪。
    他们还没有吃完饭，敌人的飞机突然来到了。老太太记挂着山下三个女儿，便赶快往家里跑，担架班长脚跟脚也跑出来。他们刚刚出洞，姚显儒就听见燃烧弹爆炸的声音，接着浓烟四起，山下的房子已经着火了。姚显儒同志这时那里还能安静地躺着！就不顾自己的伤痛，从洞子里艰难地爬下山去。等他爬下山的时候，刚才他们休息过的房子，正在熊熊燃烧，两个大一些的女儿，已经被从火里救出来，但都已烧得满身是伤。那个十二岁的小女儿，烧得不像人形，在一边地下躺着，已经断了气。这时候，老太太似乎完全疯狂了，她一会扑到死了的小女儿身上；一会又往正燃烧着的房子里扑；一会又张着两手，两眼发直地高喊着，往大路上飞跑，意思是要找美国鬼子拚命。被烧伤的女儿呆呆站在一旁，已经没有眼泪。担架班长拚命拉着老太太，不让她往火里扑，但他一个人拉不住她。这时候，姚显儒同志完全忘掉了自己的伤，就爬上前去帮助担架班长，把老太太拉住。他高喊着：
    “阿母尼！有我在这里，我就是你的儿子，我一定替你报仇！……”老太太看见腿上流着血的姚显儒同志也爬下山来，仿佛清醒了过来，不再往火里扑，抱着他的头哭起来。
    一个白天，老太太就这样在洞子里过去，哭啊，怒骂啊，诉说啊！千言万语总归落到两句话上：
    “孩子！替我们报这血仇呀！”“放心吧，阿母尼！总要替你报仇的！”
    傍晚的时候，他们的担架，离开九化里。老太太和她的二女儿，送了四五里路。在一个小山头上，老太太呆呆站在那里，看着他们的担架走入山下的开阔地。一二里外，姚显儒同志在担架上回头看，朝鲜老妈妈还在山坡上站着，一直向他们招手。
    就这样，一直到祖国。姚显儒同志一闭上眼睛，就看到那个朝鲜老妈妈，风吹着她的白头发，在山头上向他招手；一合眼，就听到朝鲜老妈妈的声音：“替我们报仇呀，替我们报仇！”
    “我是战士，赶快再上前线去！”
    “志愿军的伤员一回到祖国，就像受伤的孩子回到母亲的怀抱，没有一处不感到温暖。车站上，人山人海地迎接我们。住院后慰劳队穿梭一样，一个没去，一个又来。妇女自动组织起来给我们洗衣服，小学生捧着鲜花站在面前喊志愿军叔叔，……。可是，祖国越温暖，我就越住不下去，我是个战士，我还没有尽到我的责任，我只有一个念头，伤赶快好，赶快再上前线去！”
    “医院里上上下下都照顾得那么周到，护士轮换不断地在床前服侍，真比家里人周到十分。可是，他们照顾得越周到，我越住不下去，我是个战士，我还没有完成我的责任。我只有一个念头：快快好吧，赶快再到前线去！”
    “每天从报纸上听到祖国建设的新消息，每一天，都有新的劳动英雄创造模范出现。但好消息越多，我就越住不下去，我是一个战士，我还没有完成我的责任。我只有一个念头：伤赶快好，赶快再上前线去！”
    以上就是姚显儒同志在医院里时候的心情，所以开过刀后，伤刚刚疗住口，还有一个很大的疙瘩，他就决心出院。医生经不住他三番五次地请求，最后只好叹一口气，紧紧地握了握他的手，签发了准许他出院的证明书。
    到了康健团，他恨不得插翅飞过江来，但事情偏偏不巧，要动身的一批已经满员，他自己得从头等起。姚显儒说：“这不要急白人的头发么？”他就口干舌焦地向负责人央求，最后，团里负责遣送的同志被他感动了，终于答应他和这一批一起出发。
    他顺着原路，寻找自己的部队。他渴望着很快看到老首长、老战友们。他也渴望再看见一下那个朝鲜妈妈。黑夜又经过九化里那一带的时候，他希望能找到那些残留的房子。但是，他负伤回来的时候，是躺在担架上，夜里行进，天又下雨，到底在那里，已经记不清了，而且，经过这几个月，不少朝鲜的村庄，已经只剩下名字。他终于没有找到老妈妈在哪里。他在生满荒草的村庄废墟上站了一会，就大踏步走向前方，他自己对自己说，见不见朝鲜老妈妈，反正是一样，主要的是要记得她交代的话：“要替我们一家人报仇！”
    “惹不得你么？我偏惹惹你看！”
    姚显儒同志刚刚回来的时候，他们的部队在第二线，他日夜盼望着赶快开到第一线。这机会终于来到了，他们接受了保卫开城的任务。
    他和成千成万别的战士一样，在阵地上亲眼看到板门店上空的氢汽球和探照灯，也亲眼看到敌人轰炸中立区，炸死朝鲜老百姓，打死姚庆祥烈士，……种种破坏谈判的事实。他也知道敌人明目张胆提出要拿开城，敌人在会场上撒赖说：“叫飞机大炮和你们讲话。”用姚显儒同志自己的话说：“真把我的肺都气炸了。”
    战士们求战的情绪很高，要求出击敌人的决心书雪片似的送到连部。但在上级的教育下，他树立了持久作战的思想。他和全班的战士一道，日日夜夜突击工事，把坚硬的岩石变成了钢铁般的坑道，他们夜里不断出去打敌人的伏击，不断带着小组往前面延伸，去观察敌人前哨阵地附近的地形。今天晚上二十公尺，明天晚上五十公尺，越往前他们越熟练，越往前他们越大胆，他们离敌人的阵地前沿已经很近了。
    他们接防的时候，友军便曾告诉他们，敌人的阵地上，有很多的地雷，几天之前，也有一个出去侦察的同志触雷受伤。所以，当有一天晚上他们的小组又出发执行任务的时候，指导员就嘱咐他：“小心敌人的地雷。”姚显儒同志说：“指导员放心！”就带着班里的两个年青的战士——张振江，罗兆材，一阵风似的出发了。
    天黑漆漆的，但他们已经把这一带摸熟了，他们轻轻地疾步前进着。穿过交通壕，爬过小山坡，越过稻田的田埂，涉过山脚下的小河……后来是离敌人阵地越来越近了。地形是要天亮才能看得清楚的，他们就伏在林丛里，全身都伪装好。天明了，他们就拨开树林，悄悄往前探索。有时俯着身子前进，有时就伏在地上向前匍匐。
    在一个生满各种杂草和小树的山坡里，姚显儒刚刚迈过左脚的时候，在右脚前面，却发现有一条细细的铁丝，拦着他的右脚，他左右一看，发觉离身边不远，有一个方方的东西，他想：“这就是地雷么？”立刻觉得紧张起来。他向后面的战友摇摇手，轻声说：“可能发现了地雷！你们往后面站一站！”他便小心翼翼地，走到那个方东西前面，蹲下身子。仔细一看，上面有个几寸长的突出的东西，在那个东西上面，或横或斜地扯着好几根黄土色的比头发粗不了多少的铁丝。完全可以断定，这就是敌人的地雷了。
    姚显儒同志蹲在那里，狠狠地盯着那个怪东西，他想起，上周那个夜间出来侦察的同志，就是被这怪物杀死的。他在心里说：“好凶恶的东西！你想杀死我姚显儒么？我不绊你的线，不惹你，看你怎么样我？”这样想着，他就小心地迈过铁丝，准备招呼同组的战士，也这样绕过去继续前进。
    但，刚刚过去，他忽然想：“不对，自己这样绕过去，别的战友们晚上再来侦察或者打伏击，一不小心，不是还会受伤么？”他决定在那里作个记号，回去告诉大家。这样想着，他就从口袋里掏出一张宣传品，挂在地雷附近的小树枝上。意思是等回来以后，大伙再商量办法。
    但他又一想：“这还不对，如果自己没有回去以前，又有人经过这里呢？留这东西，总是祸害。”他决定消灭了它。他跑回来通知小战友张振江，把附近稻田里的草绳拿来，他说：“我们把绳子缚在铁丝上，在四五米外一拉，雷也爆炸了，我们也没有危险。”
    张振江和罗兆材都劝他说：“对这东西不懂，最好不要轻易招惹它，这里就在敌人阵地前沿，又是白天，如果一爆炸，暴露了目标，敌人打起炮来，不是连观察地形的任务也完不成了么？”
    姚显儒觉得他们的话也很有道理，但是，心里却像火烧着一般焦躁。他想，这还不过是逢到的第一个地雷，在敌人的阵地上，这些东西还很多很多。难道能让这方形的怪物，挡住前进的道路？许多过去的事，也都在这时候一齐涌向心头，他想起在旧社会受的痛苦，想起解放后父亲对他的嘱咐，想起朝鲜那个老妈妈“替我报仇”的声音，……他的血沸腾了。
    他想起上级党平时的教育：“一个共产党员，是不向困难低头的，好的党员不单不回避困难，而且要走向困难，战胜困难……”他想起了本军的英雄、一等功臣刘光子，在五次战役中，一百多个英国鬼子围上来要活捉他，但他不畏惧，不怕死，奋身反击，结果一个人活捉了六十三个鬼子；他想起本军的模范党员李丙群，他在打尽最后一颗子弹、大量杀伤敌人以后，四面没有退路，就领着全班八个战友跳下悬崖。他悄悄对自己说：“刘光子一个人能活捉六十三个鬼子，我姚显儒就不能制服这个躺在地下不会动的怪物么？呸；不敢惹你？你是什么吃人的毒龙猛虎，今天我非惹惹你不可！”
    他霍然站起来，紧握着战友张振江和罗兆材的手说：“小弟弟们！你们往后退退，在交通壕里掩护我，监视敌人，我要试试这个怪物。你们在后面注意我的动作，如果成功了，咱们大家都学会扫雷，就从此拔掉了敌人的蝎子尾巴，以后不论侦察，出击，都打开了路；……。如果我牺牲了，你们注意我的动作是怎样弄响的，留个经验，以后继续研究。反正不论迟早，这东西咱们总得要破的，你做、我做、他做都是一样。”说完以后，也不听他们两人的劝阻，就大踏步又走近了那个地雷。
    他蹲在地雷边，想了一想，这雷是绊着线就响的，先把线弄断再讲，他就俯下身子，用牙齿咯吱一声，把那细铁丝咬断。三支线都咬断以后，他就缘着四边，把那整个的雷挖出来，双手抱起，转身向后面走。
    他也知道，咬断铁丝，并不算完事，因为听说上星期另一连有一个同志，就是弄断铁丝以后，在捧着回来的路上一慌张，雷跌到地上爆炸起来，把那人炸伤的。他很沉着地走回自己的交通壕，然后，轻轻地把它放下，搁到交通壕的边缘上，他站在交通壕里面，这个交通壕的外面，就是一个斜坡。
    他开始去卸上面的雷帽和雷管。他告诉张振江他们，他是自左向右旋转的，请他们注意。这时，他的全身的注意力都集中在这个小小的突出的东西上。他是看过手榴弹的爆炸的，他也曾无数次地把敌人掷过来还未爆炸的手榴弹重拾起来掷给敌人。因此，他天真地想：不转眼珠地盯着它，如果狗日的有点冒烟要炸的模样，就把它掀到交通壕外面的斜坡下面。但，一切进行得很顺利，那个突出的小东西，雷帽和雷管，在他的手里和下面的雷体分家了。
    “成功”的距离，是那样遥远又那样近，那样惊心动魄又那样平常。关键就在于第一个人的第一份的决心和勇敢。实质上，姚显儒同志已经成功了。但他还不能确信这怪物是不是已经被制死。他不轻视已经败到他手里的敌人。他把它抱起来，用劲地向交通壕外的斜坡下掼下去，在它快要触地的时候，他伏身在交通壕里。只听腾的一声，这个家伙，发出稀松的像石头落地似的响声。它告诉姚显儒和张振江他们，试验就这样成功了。
    “呀！成功啦，成功啦，班长！”张振江和罗兆材跑过来，拍着他的肩膀高兴得嗓子都变了。姚显儒同志也笑了，他一辈子也有许多高兴事，但似乎都没有这一次笑得那样惬意。
    一个人对于刚刚学会的新东西，兴头总是特别高的，姚显儒同志一分钟也没休息，就又拍拍战友们的肩膀，兴奋地说：“你们在这里掩护我，我再去抱几个‘老虎娃’回来。”说着，便又爬向前面去。十几分钟内，他又抱回十个平台雷，另外，还有三个照明雷。
    青年人是缺乏等待的耐性的，张振江要求班长立刻教会他。就在交通壕边，几分钟内，张振江也
    “出了师”。“班长！你掩护我，让我也去摘回几个大瓜来！”小伙子说着就跑出去，一会儿也抱回了三个平台雷。
    就这样，敌人飘洋过海运来的，吹嘘着“近代化”的“法宝”，就像中国旧小说“封神榜”上现原形的怪物一样，在我们一个普通战士的前面完全破产了。
    前线地雷大搬家
    姚显儒同志从此更忙起来，他多了一项工作。他不愿耽误分内的工作，就利用休息的时间，教其他的同志们。学会以后，就在自己的阵地上实习。他把雷重装起来，放在一定的位置，新学的同志挨着把它起下来。他为了怕万一出岔子伤人，事先悄悄地在上面安上保险插鞘，站在一旁细心检查他们的动作，学习的人并不知道，因此十分认真小心，他自己心里有数，保险不会在实习中伤人。
    很快的，大家都学会了。团里、师里，附近的友军，都邀他传播经验。像播种一样，他的经验成为千百人的经验，他的智慧成为千百人的智慧。在传播中、实习中，技术经验又不断发展。自然，在别的部队中，别一条战线上，也同样产生着姚显儒这样的扫雷英雄，很短的时间，广大的战线上，就掀起了“地雷大搬家”运动。头一天晚上敌人埋在他们前沿阵地上的各种地雷，第二天就被我们的战士背回来。最初，愚蠢的敌人哪料到这些？他们还凭仗着他们的地雷做他们的看家狗的时候，我们的战士已经冲入他们的阵地，许多敌人连鞋子也没有来得及穿就做了俘虏。
    才开始的时候，这些雷还只帮我们添些炸药，帮助我们挖挖坑道工事，但它越来越多，我们的战士嫌它作炸药用太可惜，就把它重新装置起来，埋在我们的阵地上，让这些美造的地雷，等待他们自己的主人。许多敌人在偷袭我们的阵地的时候，被炸得血肉横飞。每一个战士都知道，“敌人有什么，他就最怕什么”，因为他们的头目，他们的报纸，是整天宣传那些玩意的威力的。
    但是，仅仅这样，还不能使我们战士满足。他们更进一步，黑夜爬到敌人的阵地上，起下他们的雷，就埋在他们的阵地上。雷还是他们的雷，但不同的是埋的地方变了，标记换了，安装的方法变了。这样，白天和黑夜，在敌人的阵地上，经常发生突然爆炸的响声。敌人很不喜欢这些声音，因为这些他们自己制造、自己运来、自己埋在地下的杀人武器，炸的不是别人，正是他们自己。
