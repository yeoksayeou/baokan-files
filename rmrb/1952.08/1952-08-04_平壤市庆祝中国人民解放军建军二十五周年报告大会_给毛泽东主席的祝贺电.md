To the respected Chairman Mao Zedong:
    Today, as we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the mighty military force of the great Chinese people—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—we extend our warm congratulations to you, the founder and organizer of the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as to all the Chinese people and the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    The twenty-five-year historical path traversed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, founded and led by you and the Chinese Communist Party, is a glorious path of struggle against aggression and exploitation and for the freedom, unity, independence, and peace of the Chinese people.
    With the love and support of the entire Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, through glorious and arduous struggles, has achieved the unity, independence, and liberation of China.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army, educated in Marxism-Leninism and lofty patriotism and internationalism, has grown into an invincible army through long and arduous practical revolutionary struggles over the past twenty-five years. Today, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army stands firmly at its post, safeguarding the victorious achievements of the people's democracy won by the Chinese people. It is not only a fortress defending the Chinese people but also a powerful force safeguarding peace and security in Asia and the world.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army defeated American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, winning the unity, independence, and liberation of the Chinese people. Its glorious history serves as a living example for us, the Korean people, who are today fighting against the armed aggression of American imperialist aggressors and their lackey, the traitorous Lee Seung-man bandit gang, to achieve the reunification, independence, and liberation of our fatherland. The glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers are fighting heroically alongside us to eliminate and drive out our common enemy, the American aggressors. We, the Korean people, will never forget the immortal great feats established by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers on our soil and the noble blood they shed.
    Respected Chairman Mao Zedong, today, despite the lessons of repeated defeats in the face of the heroic struggles of the people of Korea and China, the American imperialists have not yet abandoned their ambitions to invade Korea and Asia. They have used bacteriological weapons with the aim of massacring large numbers of our Korean and Chinese people, and they are frantically bombing our power plants and peaceful residents. In order to forcibly detain our prisoners of war, they are engaging in cruel torture and murder, attempting to delay the armistice negotiations. However, these insane crimes of the American aggressors will surely be crushed by the united strength and heroic struggle of the people of Korea and China. We, the people of Korea and China, have the support and solidarity of hundreds of millions of working people and peace-loving people around the world, led by the great Soviet Union. We will surely achieve victory in the just struggle against the common enemy of mankind, American imperialism.
    On the occasion of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we respectfully wish the Chinese people even greater victories in the cause of building a people's China and strengthening national defense; for the more consolidated unity and victory of the people of Korea and China, we respectfully wish you boundless longevity.

    平壤市庆祝中国人民解放军建军二十五周年报告大会
    给毛泽东主席的祝贺电敬爱的毛泽东主席：
    今天我们庆祝伟大的中国人民的强大武力——中国人民解放军创建二十五周年，谨向您——光荣的中国人民解放军的创建者和组织者以及全中国人民和中国人民解放军指挥员、战斗员致热烈的祝贺。
    您和中国共产党所创建和领导的中国人民解放军所走过的二十五年的历史道路是反对侵略和榨取、争取中国人民自由统一独立与和平的光荣的斗争道路。
    中国人民解放军在全中国人民的热爱和支持下，通过光荣而艰苦的斗争，取得了中国的统一独立和自由解放。
    中国人民解放军是受马列主义和崇高的爱国主义、国际主义所教育的，它经过二十五年来长期而艰苦的实际革命斗争，已成长壮大为百战百胜的军队了。今天英雄的中国人民解放军正坚强地站立在保卫中国人民所业已取得的人民民主的胜利果实的岗位上，它不仅是保卫中国人民的堡垒，而且也是保卫亚洲及世界和平安全的一支强大的力量。
    中国人民解放军打垮了美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，赢得了中国人民的统一独立和自由解放，它的光荣的历史成了今天我们朝鲜人民为争取祖国统一独立和自由解放反抗美帝国主义武装侵略者及其走狗李承晚卖国匪帮而斗争的活榜样。光荣的中国人民志愿军将士们为了消灭驱逐共同的敌人美国侵略者，正和我们并肩英勇地战斗着。我们朝鲜人民将永远不会忘记中国人民志愿军将士们在我国疆土上所建立的不朽的伟大功勋和他们所流的高贵的鲜血。
    敬爱的毛泽东主席，今天美帝国主义者不顾其在朝中两国人民英勇斗争面前屡遭惨败的教训，到现在仍未放弃其侵略朝鲜和亚洲的野心，而以大量屠杀我们朝中两国人民为目的使用了细菌武器，并且穷凶极恶地轰炸我们的发电厂与和平居民，为了强迫扣留我方被俘人员，它正在疯狂地肆行着拷问虐杀，企图以此拖延停战谈判。但是美国侵略者这种疯狂的罪行，必将为朝中两国人民的团结力量和英勇的斗争所粉碎。我们朝中两国人民有着以伟大的苏联为首的全世界数万万劳动大众和爱好和平的人民的支持和声援，在反抗人类公敌美帝国主义的正义斗争中一定取得胜利。
    在庆祝中国人民解放军建军二十五周年的光荣节日之际，敬祝中国人民在建设人民中国和加强国防的事业上获得更巨大的胜利；为了朝中两国人民更巩固的团结和胜利，敬祝您万寿无疆。
    平壤市庆祝中国人民解放军建军二十五周年报告大会
    一九五二年七月三十一日
