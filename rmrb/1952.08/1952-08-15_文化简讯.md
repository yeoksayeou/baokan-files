    Ancient Grottoes Discovered in Yongjing, Gansu

    A group of ancient architectural grottoes has recently been discovered in the mountains on the north bank of the Yellow River in Yongjing County, Gansu Province. These grottoes are located near the ancient Bingling Temple, and there are more than 200 of them, large and small. According to preliminary investigations, exceptionally rich great artistic creations of the ancient working people of our country have been found in the various caves. These include murals, statues, and carvings from the Jin, Wei, Western Qin, early Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, dating back to the 3rd century AD. Among them, the artistic style of the stone pagodas and granary reliefs from the early Tang Dynasty is rarely seen in the ancient cultural relics discovered in China. In addition, there is a "Great Buddha" more than ten meters high, a "Reclining Buddha" more than ten meters long, and ruins of some ancient buildings near the grottoes. These grotto buildings are on the cliffs of the canyon, and the "sky bridges" and "plank roads" built in ancient times to access the grottoes have been completely destroyed, making it impossible to climb them under normal circumstances. The surveyors were only able to climb less than one percent of all the grottoes this time.
