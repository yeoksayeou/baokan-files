    New Victories in the Socialist Construction of People's Democratic Countries in Eastern Europe
    Second Quarter Industrial Production Plans All Exceeded
    [Xinhua News Agency] People's democratic countries in Eastern Europe have achieved new victories in building socialism and realizing large-scale industrialization. The second quarter industrial production plans of all countries have been exceeded, and the total industrial output has increased significantly compared with the same period last year. According to TASS reports: Romania completed 101.8 percent of its second quarter industrial production plan, Hungary completed 101.7 percent, Poland completed 100.4 percent, Albania completed 100.3 percent, and Bulgaria completed 100.2 percent. Czechoslovakia has completed 98.5 percent of its expanded industrial production plan for the first half of the year. Compared with the second quarter of last year, Albania's total industrial output increased by 28.3 percent, Hungary increased by 23.5 percent, Romania increased by 21.1 percent, Poland increased by approximately 20 percent, and Bulgaria increased by 19.4 percent. Czechoslovakia's total industrial output in the first half of this year increased by 18 percent compared to the same period last year.
    The rapid increase in the production of heavy industrial sectors and the successive commencement of industries producing new machinery are common characteristics of the economic construction of various people's democratic countries at the current stage. In the first half of this year, Czechoslovakia's light industrial output increased by 11 percent compared with the same period last year, but heavy industrial output increased by 26.6 percent. In the second quarter, Poland overfulfilled its production plans for a large amount of iron ore, zinc ore, copper ore, coke, petroleum, electricity, as well as automobiles, agricultural machinery, and industrial equipment. In the first half of this year, Romania's machinery industry began producing new types of machinery such as powerful tractors, long-arm cranes, and bulldozers. Compared with the second quarter of last year, Hungary's steel production increased by 15.8 percent, truck production increased by 76 percent, and diesel engine production increased by approximately 300 percent in the second quarter of this year; Bulgaria's milled iron production increased by 97 percent, ore production increased by 41 percent, electricity production increased by 40 percent, and coal production increased by 12 percent.
    This year, all people's democratic countries have successfully carried out basic construction work, and new industrial enterprises have been able to start construction on schedule or ahead of schedule. This has guaranteed the implementation of industrial production plans and created prerequisites for a new upsurge in industry. Czechoslovakia completed a total of 538 industrial and transportation construction projects in the first half of this year. A blast furnace and two open-hearth furnaces at the Gottwald Steel Plant, which has an annual steel production capacity of over one million tons, have commenced production, and a newly built large power station has begun supplying electricity. Bulgaria has allocated 96 billion leva this year for the construction of new industrial enterprises. The magnificent Lenin Steel Plant completed the construction of three workshops in June and is currently processing the installation of rolling mill and open-hearth furnace workshops. The "Studunna" water gate, which plays an important role in industrial construction, will be completed this year. Hungary's total investment in the first half of this year increased by 27.6 percent compared with the same period last year. The largest blast furnace in Hungary at the Gyosgyor Metallurgical Plant was completed in the second quarter and produced its first batch of products on May 10th. Romania's total investment in the second quarter of this year increased by 40.7 percent compared with last year. It is now fully engaged in the construction of the country's largest construction projects—the Danube-Black Sea Canal and the Lenin Hydropower Station. In the canal's construction zone, many machinery factories, building materials factories, and repair factories have commenced operations. They will continue to expand and develop, becoming the foundation for the industrialization of the Dobruja region. The construction plan for Poland's largest steel plant, the "Nowa Huta" Steel Plant, has been expanded by 1.4 times this year compared to last year. Forty new sets of equipment are scheduled to be completed and put into operation by the end of the year. Blast furnaces and rolling mills at the Czestochowa Steel Plant will also commence operations within this year.
    The timely and over-fulfillment of industrial production plans on a quarterly basis demonstrates the vigorous power of the people's democratic system and enables the people's democratic countries to rely on the endless potential unearthed in the implementation of plans to expand and complete large-scale construction plans ahead of schedule, and more rapidly achieve large-scale industrialization and socialist victory. Bulgaria's Five-Year Plan to lay the foundation for socialism was originally scheduled to be completed in 1953, with total industrial output increasing by 119 percent compared to 1948, and the ratio of industrial production to agricultural production becoming 45 to 55. However, in 1951, total industrial output had already reached 97 percent of the highest target of the Five-Year Plan, and this year's total industrial output is expected to increase by 24.4 percent compared to last year. This means that the Five-Year Plan will be completed one year ahead of schedule and will exceed the highest target of the plan by 16.5 percent. Czechoslovakia and Hungary have both expanded their Five-Year Plans last year on the basis of the quarterly over-fulfillment of industrial production plans. Czechoslovakia's total industrial output was expanded from the original target of a 57 percent increase over 1948 to a 92 percent increase, and heavy industry was expanded from a 93 percent increase to a 131 percent increase. Hungary's total industrial output was expanded from the original target of a 186.4 percent increase over 1949 to a 310 percent increase, and heavy industry was expanded from a doubling to a quadrupling. Poland's Six-Year Plan stipulates that this year's industrial output will increase by 71.1 percent compared to 1949, but in 1951, industrial output had already increased by 62.7 percent compared to 1949, and is expected to increase by 99 percent compared to 1949 this year. After completing the 1951 plan (the first year of the Five-Year Plan), Romania's industrial production increased by 28.7 percent compared to 1950, and industry accounted for 60.4 percent of the national economy. Albania's 1951 (the first year of the Five-Year Plan) industrial production plan was completed at 105.9 percent, and total industrial output increased by 47.1 percent compared to 1950.

    东欧人民民主国家建设社会主义的新胜利
    第二季工业生产计划均超额完成
    【新华社讯】东欧人民民主国家在建设社会主义和实现大规模工业化的道路上又获得了新的胜利，各国的第二季工业生产计划均已超额完成，工业总产量比去年同期有显著增加。据塔斯社报道：罗马尼亚完成了第二季工业生产计划的百分之一百零一点八，匈牙利完成了计划的百分之一百零一点七，波兰完成了计划的百分之一百点四，阿尔巴尼亚完成了计划的百分之一百点三，保加利亚完成了计划的百分之一百点二。捷克斯洛伐克上半年扩大的工业生产计划业已完成了百分之九十八点五。和去年第二季相比，阿尔巴尼亚工业总产量增加了百分之二十八点三，匈牙利增加了百分之二十三点五，罗马尼亚增加了百分之二十一点一，波兰增加了约百分之二十，保加利亚增加了百分之十九点四。捷克斯洛伐克今年上半年工业总产量比去年同期增加了百分之十八。
    重工业部门生产量的迅速增加和生产新机器的工业的陆续开工，是各人民民主国家在现阶段经济建设中的共同特点。捷克斯洛伐克今年上半年轻工业产量比去年同期增加了百分之十一，但重工业产量增加了百分之二十六点六。波兰第二季超计划生产了大量的铁矿砂、锌矿砂、铜矿砂、焦炭、石油、电力、以及汽车、农业机器和工业设备。罗马尼亚机器工业在今年上半年已开始生产强力的拖拉机、长臂起重机、铲土机等新型机器。和去年第二季相较，今年第二季匈牙利的钢铁产量增加了百分之十五点八，卡车增产百分之七十六，柴油引擎增产约百分之三百；保加利亚的铣铁增产百分之九十七，矿砂增产百分之四十一，电力增产百分之四十，煤增产百分之十二。
    今年内各人民民主国家都胜利地进行了基本建设的工作，新的工业企业都能如期和提前开工，这就保证了工业生产计划的执行，并为工业的新高涨创造了先决条件。捷克斯洛伐克今年上半年落成的工业和运输业的建筑共五百三十八所，年产钢铁一百万吨以上的哥特瓦尔德钢铁厂的一座鼓风炉和两座马丁炉已开工生产，新建成的一个大电力站已开始供电。保加利亚今年拨款九百六十亿利瓦用于建设新工业企业。宏伟的列宁钢铁厂在六月间完成了三个工场的建筑，正在加工进行辗钢工场、马丁炉工场的装设工作。在工业建设中占重要地位的“斯图敦纳”水闸将在今年竣工。匈牙利今年上半年投资总额比去年同期增加了百分之二十七点六。吉奥斯乔尔冶金厂的全匈牙利最大的一座鼓风炉已在第二季竣工，并在五月十日出产了第一批产品。罗马尼亚今年第二季投资总额比去年增加了百分之四十点七，现在正全力建设国内最大的建设工程——多瑙河—黑海运河和列宁水力发电站，在运河的建筑地带上，许多机械工厂、建筑材料厂和修理厂都已开工，它们将要继续扩充和发展，成为多布鲁查地区工业化的基础。波兰最大的钢铁厂“诺伐·胡塔”钢铁厂今年的建设计划比去年扩大了一点四倍，年底以前有四十组新装置要落成开工，捷斯托科发钢铁厂的鼓风炉和辗铁工场，都将在今年年内开工。
    工业生产计划的逐季如期超额完成，显示出人民民主制度的蓬勃有力，并使各人民民主国家能依靠在执行计划中发掘出来的无穷无尽的潜力，扩大和提前完成大规模的建设计划，更加迅速地取得大规模工业化和社会主义的胜利。保加利亚奠定社会主义基础的五年计划原定在一九五三年完成，工业总产量应比一九四八年增加百分之一百一十九，工业生产和农业生产的比率将成为四十五比五十五。但一九五一年工业总产量已达到五年计划最高目标的百分之九十七，今年工业总产量预计将比去年增加百分之二十四点四，这就是说五年计划将要提早一年完成，并将超过计划最高目标的百分之十六点五。捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利都在工业生产计划逐季超额完成的基础上，在去年扩大了五年计划。捷克斯洛伐克工业总产量由原定比一九四八年增加百分之五十七扩大到增加百分之九十二，重工业由增加百分之九十三扩大到增加百分之一百三十一；匈牙利的工业总产量由原定比一九四九年增加百分之一百八十六点四扩大到增加百分之三百一十，重工业由增加两倍扩大为增加四倍。波兰六年计划规定今年工业产量比一九四九年增加百分之七十一点一，但一九五一年工业产量已比一九四九年增加了百分之六十二点七，预计今年将比一九四九年增加百分之九十九。罗马尼亚完成一九五一年计划（五年计划的第一年）后，工业生产比一九五○年增加了百分之二十八点七，工业在国民经济中的比重达到百分之六十点四。阿尔巴尼亚一九五一年（五年计划的第一年）工业生产计划完成了百分之一百零五点九，工业总产量比一九五○年增加了百分之四十七点一。
