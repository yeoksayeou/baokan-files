Hailun Technology Extension Station of the Northeast Agricultural Department
Mobilizes the Masses to Increase Fertilizer Accumulation and Improve Fertilizer Quality

    The Hailun Technology Extension Station of the Northeast People's Government's Agricultural Department has decided to help seven villages, including Lusheng Village, launch a large-scale mass fertilizer accumulation campaign during the slack season after hoeing.
    The soil in Lusheng Village and the other six villages is relatively fertile, and there are many reclaimable mountain wastelands and meadows. Local farmers have not traditionally valued fertilizer accumulation. Farmers said, "Rather reclaim wasteland than apply manure," and "Applying manure is not as profitable as reclaiming wasteland." In the early stages of the government's call for fertilization, many farmers preferred to haul manure outside the village to fill ditches rather than take a few extra steps to send it to the fields. In recent years, with the government's strong call for fertilizer accumulation, farmers have begun to accumulate manure, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased year by year, but most farmers still follow the old method of "the same manure every three years" and are unwilling to actively accumulate manure. In rural areas, livestock manure is everywhere, and the roads are covered with a thick layer, but farmers do not bother to pick it up.
    Based on this situation, the Agricultural Technology Extension Station decided to cooperate with the local government to launch a large-scale mass fertilizer accumulation campaign in seven villages, including Lusheng Village, during the slack season after hoeing. Eleven mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives using new-style farm implements will take the lead in guiding ordinary farmers to participate. The plan is to apply twenty cartloads of manure per hectare (each cart weighing 2,000 catties) to 85% of the land in seven villages, including Lusheng Village.
    In order to expand fertilizer sources, the extension station requires farmers to achieve "three diligences" (diligence in getting up early, diligence in using bedding materials, and diligence in cleaning), and "four haves" (people have toilets, pigs have pens, cattle and horses have stalls, and every household has a manure pile); it requires the eleven new-style farm implement groups (cooperatives) to build a standard horse fence each. At the same time, it promotes the Zha Zha bacteria manure-making method, using straw or weeds as raw materials to produce fertilizer needed for 350 hectares of land. It advocates cutting green manure and using wheat straw, potato vines, etc. to make compost.
    In order to improve the quality of manure fertilizer and improve fertilizer accumulation methods, the extension station requires farmers to dig ditches around manure piles and build manure walls with earth to prevent chickens and dogs from trampling on them and fertilizer from being lost. Manure should be piled using the scientific method of laying a layer of manure and a layer of soil, ensuring at least three turnings, and frequent watering (but avoiding excessive water accumulation) to promote full fermentation and decomposition of the manure. It promotes the use of cellar-style covered toilets, which can prevent wind and rain, as well as block sunlight, reducing fertilizer loss. Grass ash should be accumulated and stored separately, and water should be poured on it to prevent wind from blowing it away; it should be ensured that it is not poured on manure piles or in toilets, so as to prevent the nitrogen fertilizer in the manure from turning into gas and volatilizing, reducing fertilizer effectiveness.
    Currently, this campaign has already begun. Lusheng Village Wang Yongzhen Agricultural Production Cooperative, taking advantage of the gaps during cloudy and rainy days, completely cleared the manure pits and horse pen manure that had been accumulated for many years in less than five days, unearthing a total of 500 cartloads of manure, enough for 25 hectares of land. The extension station took the lead in doing a good job in environmental sanitation, sharing responsibility with farmers for cleaning the streets in sections, and took the lead in building a cellar-style toilet as a demonstration for the masses. The extension station dispatched special personnel to guide farmers in using Zha Zha bacteria to make manure, improve manure piling methods, and helped farmers to formulate practical and easy-to-implement fertilizer accumulation plans. They also cooperated with local governments and health agencies in seven villages to absorb Party members, League members, women's directors, labor models, and activists to form a fertilizer accumulation inspection committee, dividing the work to go deep into villages, hamlets, groups, and households to carry out ideological mobilization and specific inspections. The committee is preparing to combine the summer hoeing competition campaign, with the eleven new-style farm implement groups (cooperatives) taking the lead in launching a red flag fertilizer accumulation competition between villages, hamlets, groups, and households.

    东北农业部海伦技术推广站
    发动群众增积肥料提高肥料质量
    东北人民政府农业部海伦技术推广站决定在挂锄期间，帮助禄生村等七个村庄，开展大规模的群众性积肥运动。
    禄生村等七个村庄的土质比较肥沃，当地可开垦的山荒、草甸子又多，当地农民一向不重视积肥工作。农民说：“宁肯开荒也不上粪”，“上粪不如开荒得利”。在政府号召施肥初期，许多农民宁肯把粪拉出屯外，填了壕沟，也不肯多走几步，送到田里。近年来政府大力号召积肥，农民已开始积肥攒粪，施肥数量逐年增加，但多数农民还是沿袭着“三年一样粪”的旧办法，不肯积极攒粪。在农村里面，牲畜粪便到处皆是，大道上铺着很厚一层，农民都不去拾拣。
    农业技术推广站根据这种情况，决定在挂锄期间，配合当地政府，在禄生村等七个村庄开展大规模的群众性的积肥运动，由十一个使用新式农具的互助组和农业生产合作社带头，引导一般农民参加。计划在禄生村等七个村庄的百分之八十五的土地上，每垧地上粪二十车（每车两千斤）。
    为了扩大肥料来源，推广站要求农民做到“三勤”（勤起、勤垫、勤打扫），“四有”（人有厕所、猪有圈、牛马有栏、家家有粪堆）；要求十一个新式农具组（社）各修好标准马栅一个。同时推广扎扎菌造粪法，用秸棵或杂草做原料，制造三百五十垧地所需的肥料。提倡割青，并用麦秸、土豆秧等做堆肥。
    为了提高粪肥质量、改善积肥方法，推广站要求农民在粪堆周围挖沟，用土筑粪墙，防止鸡狗糟蹋和肥分流失。堆粪要采用铺一层粪、垫一层土的科学方法，保证最少倒翻三次，并要勤浇水（但避免积水过多），以促进粪肥充分发酵腐熟。推广窖式有盖厕所，这样既能防止风吹雨打，又能遮挡日光，减少肥效损失。草木灰要单攒单放，并在上面浇水，防止风吹；保证不倒在粪堆上或厕所内，以免粪里的氮肥变成气体挥发，降低肥效。
    目前这一运动已经开展起来。禄生村王永珍农业生产合作社利用阴天下雨的空隙，不到五天工夫，已将积攒了多年的粪坑和马圈粪彻底清除了一次，共起出五百车粪，足够二十五垧地之用。推广站带头作好环境卫生工作，和农民分段负责清扫街道，并率先修好窖式厕所一处，为群众示范。推广站派遣专人指导农民使用扎扎菌造粪，改进堆粪方法，又帮助农民订出切实易行的积肥计划。他们还配合地方政府和卫生机构，在七个村吸收党员、团员、妇女主任、劳动模范和积极分子，组成积肥检查委员会，分工深入村、屯、组、户，进行思想动员和具体检查。委员会准备结合夏锄评比运动，由十一个新式农具组（社）带头发动村和村、屯和屯、组和组、户和户之间的夺红旗积肥竞赛。    （王锦威、李明发）
