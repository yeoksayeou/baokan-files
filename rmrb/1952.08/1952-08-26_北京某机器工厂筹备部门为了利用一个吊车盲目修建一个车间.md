Beijing Machine Factory Preparatory Department
Blindly Builds a Workshop to Utilize a Crane
Wang Jingzhi, Director of the Comprehensive Planning Office of the Central Heavy Industry Department

The preparatory department of a certain machine factory in Beijing blindly designed and built a foundry workshop simply to utilize a 25-ton crane. In addition, the design personnel lacked production knowledge, resulting in a series of errors in the construction work.

The 1950 National Machine Industry Conference decided that the Central Machine Industry Administration would establish a new type of machine factory in Beijing. To build a machine factory, a thorough investigation and research must first be conducted to determine the product plan and scale before design and construction can begin. The product plan for this factory was not finalized until July 1952, while its foundry workshop was completed at the end of 1951. When designing the foundry workshop, the factory's preliminary design had not yet been determined; however, the department in charge of preparing for the factory at that time, merely eager to utilize an existing 25-ton crane, hastily made a plant layout sketch in July 1950 (this sketch is now completely inapplicable). Based on this sketch, they presented the following design conditions to the construction company responsible for the civil engineering part of the foundry workshop design: a factory building area of 6,000 square meters, a crane lifting capacity of 25 tons, and a furnace maximum size of no more than 8 tons, etc. This set of so-called design conditions, because it was not based on comprehensive survey data and did not consider the issue from a holistic point of view, made the subsequent work very chaotic. For example, the charging platform was originally designed for an 8-ton furnace, but now a 3-ton furnace is installed. As a result, the charging platform appears particularly high and cannot be matched with the furnace; instead, the furnace must be matched with the charging platform. Furthermore, in order to build a baking oven, it was necessary to demolish the already built walls; to use electricity, additional investment was required for the construction of a transformer substation; to use water, additional investment was required for a water tower, and so on, creating great chaos in the financial work of capital construction. In addition, due to incomplete planning, workers arrived without a canteen or clinic; because there was no metalworking repair shop, a nearby mobile warehouse had to be used instead; because there was no fixed warehouse, coke and pig iron had to be piled up at the gate.

The designer's lack of understanding of the operation and production procedures of the foundry factory, as well as the failure to conduct investigations and research, were also the cause of design errors. For example, without investigating the weight of the 25-ton crane, only subjective estimation was used, and thus the impact force, bending moment, the weight of the crane itself, and the stress of the beam frame during crane activity were all miscalculated. The total weight of most of the factory's products is only three to five tons, and the weight of each casting is of course even smaller. Therefore, designing a crane based on a 25-ton casting is a waste.

Due to the unserious attitude of the preparatory workers, the construction of the entire factory is now in a state of confusion. This practice of treating capital construction work as child's play should be corrected urgently.

    北京某机器工厂筹备部门
    为了利用一个吊车盲目修建一个车间
    中央重工业部综合计划室主任　王敬之
    北京某机器工厂的筹备部门，仅仅为了利用一个起重二十五吨的吊车，就盲目设计和修建翻砂车间，再加上设计人员不懂得生产知识，因而造成了建设工作中的一系列的错误。
    一九五○年全国机器工业会议决议由中央机器工业管理局在北京筹设一个新型机器工厂。建设一个机器工厂，必需首先经过周密的调查研究，确定了产品方案和规模，才能进行设计与施工。这个工厂的产品方案到一九五二年七月才肯定，而它的翻砂车间已于一九五一年年底建设完了。设计翻砂车间时，工厂的初步设计还没有确定；但是，当时负责筹备该厂的部门，仅仅为了急于利用旧有的一个起重二十五吨的吊车，就在一九五○年七月匆匆地作了一个全厂的布置草图（这个草图在目前已完全不适用），并根据这个草图，向设计翻砂车间的土木建筑部分的建筑公司提出设计条件：厂房面积六千平方公尺，吊车起重能力二十五吨，熔炉最大不超过八吨等。这一套所谓设计条件，因为没有全面的调查资料做根据，也没有从全部的观点考虑问题，所以使以后的工作十分混乱。如加料台原是按八吨炉设计的，现在按装的是三吨炉，结果加料台显得特别高，不能配合熔炉，反而要熔炉配合加料台了。又如为了建设烘炉，不得不把已建好的墙拆除；为了要用电而追加变电所的建筑费；为了要用水而追加水塔的投资等等。造成基本建设的财务工作的极大混乱。此外，由于计划不周密，以致工人来了没有食堂，没有医务所；因为没有金工的修理车间，不得不用附近的活动仓库来代替；因为没有固定的仓库，不得不把焦炭和生铁堆在大门边。
    设计者对于翻砂工厂的操作和生产程序不甚了解，又不调查研究，也是造成设计错误的原因。如不调查二十五吨吊车的重量，只凭主观估计，于是把冲击力、弯距、吊车本身重量，和吊车活动时梁架的出力等都算错了。这个工厂的大部分产品的总重量不过三吨到五吨，每一个铸件的重量当然更小，因此，按起重二十五吨铸件来设计吊车，就成为浪费了。
    由于筹备工作者的不严肃的态度，现在，整个工厂的建设也处于茫无头绪之中。这种拿着基本建设工作当儿戏的作法，亟应纠正。
