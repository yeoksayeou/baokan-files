	The First Direct North-South Freight Train in Chinese History

	On June 18th, the Guangzhou South Station dispatched the first through freight train No. 19714 to Manchuria, a China-Soviet Union joint transport originating direct train. This train continuously passed through more than 20 marshalling stations in the country, traveling from the southernmost city in China to the northernmost border, making it the longest direct train in Chinese railway history. This train does not stop along the way and travels at the highest speed, saving a total of 3,537 car hours and 166,623,900 RMB for the country. It also reduces train reorganization operations at intermediate marshalling stations, saving manpower and material losses.
	Railway workers, with great excitement, prepared for the operation of this first long-distance originating direct freight train connecting China and the Soviet Union and running through the north and south. Three complete car groups used only four minutes and thirty-nine seconds to load the entire train. The shunting group contacted the loading and unloading complete car group to pre-assemble ten cars and hand them over to the train inspection group for inspection. Comrade Li Rong, a car inspector, said: "This train is connected with our Soviet elder brother, and the cars must be inspected carefully." When the locomotive was connected for air brake testing, workers replaced any exhaust valves that showed even a slight leak. They said: "This train is going to the farthest place, so everyone must pay attention and there can be no carelessness in the work." The goods transported by this train were rained on for days during customs declaration, and the packaging was wet. The weight on the cargo manifest was heavier than the weight weighed by the station. After loading, the station found that the vehicles were overloaded, some exceeding 200 kilograms, some exceeding 300 kilograms, and some exceeding 700 kilograms, requiring temporary weight adjustments. The South Station master and the chairman of the trade union immediately mobilized all employees to unite and help each other, completing this task before departure.
	Now, assembling China-Soviet Union joint transport direct freight trains has almost become a regular task for Guangzhou South Station. With the spirit of making persistent efforts, the workers are focusing on organizing sources of goods, learning advanced Soviet work methods, and gradually carrying out a 500-kilometer full-load and over-axle campaign, striving to save more funds for the country and complete greater transportation tasks.

    中国历史上第一次由南到北的直达货物列车
    广州南站于六月十八日开出了第一九七一四次到满洲里的中苏联运始发直达货物列车。这次列车连续通过国内二十多个编组大站，从中国最南方的城市到极北的边界，为中国铁路史上行程最长的一次直达列车。这次列车沿途不停，速度最高，共可节省三千五百三十七个车小时，为国家节省人民币一亿六千六百二十三万九千元；并可减少中途编组站的列车改编作业，节省人力物力的损耗。
    铁路职工们以极兴奋的心情，做好了这一次开行中苏联运、贯通南北的第一列长途始发直达货物列车的准备工作。三个整车组只用了四点三十九分钟，就把全部列车装完。调车组和装卸整车组取得联系，提前编好十个车，交列检组检查。检车员李荣同志说：“这一列车是和苏联老大哥接运的，必须把车子检查好。”在机车连接试风的时候，只要看到放风阀有一点漏风，工人们就把它换下来。他们说：“这一列车是到最远的地方去的，大家必须注意，工作不能有一点马虎。”这一列车所运的货物在报关时连日天雨，货物包皮被雨打湿了。货物报单上的重量比车站过磅的重。装车完毕后，车站发现车辆装载过重，有的超过二百公斤，有的超过三百公斤，有的超过七百公斤，必须临时调整重量。南站站长和工会主席立即动员了全体职工，团结互助，在开车前完成这个工作。
    现在，编组中苏联运直达货物列车几乎已成为广州南站的经常工作。职工们以再接再厉的精神，抓紧组织货源，学习苏联先进工作方法，逐步开展满载超轴五百公里运动，争取为国家节省更多的资金与完成更大的运输任务。　（刘家璹）
