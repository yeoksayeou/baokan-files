Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, 19th: Vincent Hallinan, the Progressive Party presidential candidate and a well-known West Coast lawyer, was released from prison on August 17th. Hallinan was arrested and imprisoned earlier this year after offending the U.S. government while serving as the defense attorney for Harry Bridges, a leader of the American Progressive Labor Union and president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. The U.S. Supreme Court, using "contempt of court" as a pretext, sentenced him to six months in prison and confined him to McNeil Island Penitentiary outside of Seattle.

On the 17th, hundreds of people lined up at the Seattle docks to welcome the newly freed Hallinan. The welcomers held signs that read "Peace!" "We want Hallinan for President!" and other slogans. When Hallinan stepped off the steamer from McNeil Island Penitentiary to the sound of music, smiling, Progressive Party Secretary Baldwin was the first to step forward to offer a warm welcome. Hallinan accepted flowers and addressed the friends who welcomed his release, saying, "I once said that if I went to prison, it would not bother me—and that is indeed the case. We who are imprisoned often gain greater strength and endurance from the stone walls and iron bars of prisons."

After returning to San Francisco, Hallinan will launch a campaign with Progressive Party vice-presidential candidate Mrs. Bass. During his imprisonment, Mrs. Hallinan has been doing preliminary campaign work on his behalf.

    进步党总统候选人哈利南获释
    【新华社十九日讯】旧金山消息：美国进步党总统候选人、西海岸著名律师哈利南已于八月十七日被释放出狱。哈利南是在今年年初担任美国进步工会领袖、国际码头与仓库工人工会主席布里治的辩护律师时触怒了美国政府，因而被捕下狱的。美国最高法院以“藐视法院”为藉口判处他六个月的徒刑，把他囚禁在西雅图市外麦克尼尔岛的监狱里。
    十七日那天，好几百人在西雅图码头上列队欢迎重获自由的哈利南，欢迎的人们手执标语牌，上面写着“和平”！“我们要哈利南作总统！”等标语。当哈利南在乐声中含笑地走出麦克尼尔岛监狱的汽船时，进步党书记鲍尔温首先上前表示热烈欢迎。哈利南接受了献花，并向欢迎他出狱的朋友们发表谈话说：“我曾经说过，如果我走进监狱去的时候，它不会使我烦恼的——而事实也的确如此。我们被关在监狱里的人往往从监狱的石壁铁栏中得到更大的力量和坚忍。”
    哈利南回到旧金山后，将与进步党副总统候选人巴斯夫人共同展开竞选活动。在他系狱期间，哈利南夫人已替他进行了竞选的初步工作。
