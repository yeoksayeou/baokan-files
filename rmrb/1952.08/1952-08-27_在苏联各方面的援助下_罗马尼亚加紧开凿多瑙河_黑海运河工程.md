Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: "Pravda" recently published an article by Grummberg, the director of the Danube-Black Sea Canal construction site in Romania, entitled "Learning from the Example of the Builders of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal." Grummberg said: The construction workers of the Danube-Black Sea Canal warmly welcomed the completion of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. They are increasingly strengthening their ties with the Soviet Union in science and technology. The Danube-Black Sea Canal could only be opened thanks to the Soviet Union's extensive and constant assistance. To open the Danube-Black Sea Canal, 120 million cubic meters of soil, including more than 15 million cubic meters of rock, must be excavated, and more than 1 million cubic meters of concrete must be poured. When studying the route, planning, and organizing the excavation of the canal, we relied on the Soviet Union's assistance in all aspects. The Soviet Union provided Romania with the latest equipment, materials, and experience applied in its great communist construction projects. We received dredgers from the Soviet Union that could dredge 200 cubic meters of mud per hour; we used powerful Soviet "Ural" crawler drilling machines to excavate 15 million cubic meters of rock, which is the main project of the canal. Cranes, tugboats, automatic loading and unloading trucks, and other machines we received from the Soviet Union have also greatly helped the canal project's progress. With the assistance of Soviet experts, we opened an automatic concrete factory to build the canal's locks. The factory has the latest Soviet equipment, exactly the same as that used on the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. This is the first time such equipment has been used in our country.
    Grummberg concluded by saying: The historical victory of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal construction workers has strengthened our confidence in turning our country's dry land into gardens.
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: The Romanian people are striving to complete their first socialist construction project, the Danube-Black Sea Canal, one year ahead of schedule (in 1953). The canal's concrete pouring project will begin this year.
    The total amount of work expected to be carried out this year is 70 percent more than last year, and the excavation work is equal to 80 percent of the total excavation volume in the three years since the canal's construction began. Thanks to the Soviet Union's large supply of machinery, the canal's excavation work is now about 87 percent mechanized, and transportation work is 95 percent mechanized.
    The Danube-Black Sea Canal was decided to be opened by the Romanian Workers' Party and the Romanian Council of Ministers in 1949. The canal runs approximately 120 li (approximately 60 kilometers) in southeastern Romania from "Black Water" town to near Constanta. The canal will allow the Danube to enter the sea near Constanta, which is 700 li (approximately 350 kilometers) shorter than the current route through Sulina. The voyage from the lower reaches of the Danube to the Black Sea will be shortened by five-sixths of the original distance, saving ships a lot of time, thereby improving transportation efficiency and reducing transportation costs. At the canal's entrance to the sea, a new seaport, Novodari, several times larger than the current Constanta, will be built, and the throughput of Romania's Black Sea ports will be greatly increased by then.
    Four industrial cities, Cernavodă, Medgidia, Poarta Albă, and Novodari, will emerge along the canal. These cities will provide a basis for the industrialization of the Dobruja region. Dobruja, which previously had no electricity supply except for Constanta, will become an important power center. Currently, several building materials factories, a repair shop sufficient to meet the needs of the entire Dobruja region, and the Ovidiu II thermal power plant, which supplies electricity to the equipment along the canal, have been completed. Transmission networks in various provinces of Dobruja, as well as new railways, highways, and warehouses, are being completed one after another. Rows upon rows of comfortable workers' apartments have been built in the areas of the aforementioned four new cities.
    After the canal is built, it will be able to guide the Danube's river water to irrigate 100,000 hectares (1.5 million mu) of arid wasteland during the Five-Year Plan period, and at the same time, 150,000 hectares (2.25 million mu) of protective forest belts will also be planted. Currently, several electric pumping stations, 24,000 meters of pumping pipes, and 225,000 meters of canals have been built in the canal area. Many pools have been drained, and hundreds of hectares of land have been reclaimed and planted with crops.

### 在苏联各方面的援助下  罗马尼亚加紧开凿多瑙河—黑海运河工程

    在苏联各方面的援助下
    罗马尼亚加紧开凿多瑙河—黑海运河工程
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”最近刊载罗马尼亚的多瑙河——黑海运河建设处处长格鲁姆堡的文章，题为“学习列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河建筑工人的榜样”。格鲁姆堡说：多瑙河—黑海运河的建筑工人热烈欢迎列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的完工。他们在科学和技术方面正日益加强着和苏联的联系。多瑙河—黑海运河完全由于苏联广泛而经常的援助才有可能开凿。开凿多瑙河—黑海运河必须挖去一亿二千万公方泥土，其中包括一千五百多万公方岩石，必须浇灌一百多万公方混凝土。在研究路线、计划和组织开凿运河的工作的时候，我们依靠了苏联各方面的援助。苏联把它在伟大共产主义建设工程中所应用的最新式的设备、材料和经验供给罗马尼亚。我们从苏联得到每小时挖泥二百公方的吸泥机；我们应用着苏联效力强大的“乌拉尔”式履带钻孔机来开凿一千五百万公方岩石，这是运河的主要工程。我们从苏联得到的起重机、拖船、自动装卸卡车以及其他机器，对运河工程的进行也有很大的帮助。在苏联专家协助之下，我们开设了自动混凝土工厂，以便建筑运河上的水闸，工厂中是苏联的最新式设备，跟列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河上运用的完全一样，这在我国还是第一次使用。
    格鲁姆堡最后说：列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河建筑工人历史性的胜利，增强了我们的信心，要把我国干燥的土地变为花园。
    【新华社讯】布加勒斯特消息：罗马尼亚人民正在争取提早一年（在一九五三年）完成他们的第一个社会主义建设工程——多瑙河—黑海运河。运河的浇筑混凝土工程今年即将开始。
    今年预计进行的工程总量比去年多百分之七十，其中挖掘工程等于运河兴工三年的挖掘总量的百分之八十。由于苏联大量供给机器，运河的挖掘工作已约有百分之八十七机械化，运输工作已有百分之九十五机械化。
    多瑙河—黑海运河是罗马尼亚工人党和罗马尼亚部长会议在一九四九年决定开凿的。这条运河在罗马尼亚东南部从“黑水”镇到康斯坦萨附近，长约一百二十华里。运河将使多瑙河经康斯坦萨附近入海，比现在经苏利那入海要近七百华里。多瑙河下游通达黑海的航程将比原来缩短六分之五，航行船只可以省去许多时间，从而提高运输效率并减低运输成本。运河的入海处将建筑一个比现在康斯坦萨大几倍的新海港诺沃达里，罗马尼亚的黑海港口的吞吐量到那时将大大增加。
    运河沿岸将出现契尔纳沃达、密吉迪亚、波塔·阿尔巴、诺沃达里四个工业城市。这些城市将使多布鲁查区获得工业化的基础。过去除康斯坦萨外毫无电力供应的多布鲁查将成为一个重要的电力中心。现在，运河区几个建筑材料工厂、一个足供全多布鲁查需要的修理厂、以电力供给运河沿岸设备的奥维第乌第二火力发电厂已经落成。多布鲁查各省的输电网以及新的铁路、公路、仓库正在相继宣告完工。在上述四个新城市的地区，都已盖起了成排成排的舒适的工人公寓。
    运河筑成后，在五年计划期间将可引导多瑙河的河水灌溉十万公顷（合一百五十万市亩）的干旱荒地，同时十五万公顷（合二百二十五万市亩）的防护林带也得植造起来。现在运河区已建筑了几个电力抽水站、二万四千公尺抽水管和二十二万五千公尺水渠。许多池沼已经抽干，成百公顷土地已经开垦出来种植了农作物。
