    The people's court is a weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship, and its most fundamental task is to suppress counter-revolutionaries and protect the people. However, some judicial workers, especially old judicial personnel who have not been reformed, have demonstrated a complete lack of people's standpoint, an inability to distinguish between friend and foe, and have even sided with the enemy, directly sheltering counter-revolutionary criminals, endangering the country and the people when trying counter-revolutionary cases.
    First, they often cite the "law does not apply retroactively" from old laws to pardon counter-revolutionary elements with deep blood debts from before liberation. They believe that crimes committed before liberation are "time-barred" and can be "ignored," arbitrarily reducing or canceling the punishment of counter-revolutionary elements. Li Dingtian, a counter-revolutionary criminal in the northern Sichuan region, killed nine revolutionary cadres including Liu Jun after the local Red Army's transferred in 1935. After liberation, he continued to carry out counter-revolutionary propaganda, threatening peasants and preventing them from joining farmers' associations. However, the trial personnel of a people's court in the Jian'ge sub-district of northern Sichuan, when handling this case, actually believed that "the defendant committed the murder before liberation" and that "past events should not be investigated." Now, he could only be convicted under Article 10, Paragraph 3 of the Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries for creating and spreading rumors. Therefore, he was only sentenced to three years in prison, completely wiping out Li's blood debt of nine lives. Wang Jinkui, a counter-revolutionary criminal in Xuzhou, served as a detective captain in the Chiang Kai-shek army and a plainclothes squad leader in the Japanese puppet army. He personally shot and killed Zhao Guangyou, the leader of our anti-Japanese guerrilla force, and also killed his wife. After liberation, he continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, and the masses hated him deeply. However, after being arrested by the public security organs and sent to the Xuzhou People's Court, the old trial personnel Yang Zhongxuan also used the reason of "not investigating the past" to lightly sentence him to only four years in prison. Later, after more than a thousand people jointly requested severe punishment, and after being criticized by the local Party and government leading organs, the sentence was changed to death. Everyone knows that during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the people suffered the massacre of counter-revolutionaries, and their blood feuds could only be kept in their hearts, with no place to complain. Only now that the people have seized power is it possible to investigate and bring these murderers to justice. But now someone comes out and says: "The law does not apply retroactively." May I ask, on whose side are they speaking? Whose interests are they trying to protect?
    Second, counter-revolutionary elements who conspire to organize riots or lie in wait for opportunities to sabotage are treated as ordinary "preparatory offenders" or "attempted offenders," advocating for lenient punishment, and even advocating "no punishment without explicit legal provisions." For example, the counter-revolutionary criminal Mou Jun, after liberation, lurked in Ya'an City, Xikang Province, organized personnel from the pseudo-Youth Army, colluded with bandit leader Li Lin, and prepared to attack Ya'an City from within and without. Mou was directly responsible for commanding the bandits in the city and for internal and external liaison. For such a counter-revolutionary criminal with serious crimes, the trial personnel of the People's Court of Xikang Province only sentenced him to six years in prison on the grounds that "the riot was unsuccessful." Another example is the counter-revolutionary criminal Ruan Xiongfei, who served as a reactionary officer in the Chiang Kai-shek army for many years. After liberation, he still gathered bad elements, forged seals, collected rifles, pistols, and 60mm mortars, and planned riots, conspiring to subvert our people's government. The trial personnel of the Xuzhou People's Court also sentenced him to only eight years in prison on the grounds that "the riot was unsuccessful." It was not until the suppression of the counter-revolutionaries that the sentence was changed to death after the masses firmly demanded it. May I ask: What are the intentions of being lenient towards those counter-revolutionary criminals who are constantly waiting for opportunities to riot and conspiring to subvert the people's regime? Is it necessary to wait until they have subverted our people's government and "achieved their goals" before severely punishing them? What other result can this have besides making it more convenient for counter-revolutionary elements to carry out sabotage activities?
    Third, the people's courts transplant the set of mechanical "judicial procedures" and "jurisdictional systems" of the reactionary courts, often emphasizing "not under the jurisdiction of this court," "must be prosecuted in a separate case," etc., ignoring counter-revolutionary criminals and allowing them to remain at large. For example, a trial personnel in Guiyang City, when hearing a civil case, when one of the parties revealed the other party's counter-revolutionary activities, used the excuse that this was a "criminal matter," which must be "tried separately," and that "he could not handle it," allowing the counter-revolutionary element to take the opportunity to escape. Fortunately, the clerk reported to the president of the court, and he was arrested and brought to justice. In a housing rental case in Nanjing City, Yu Youlan, Yin Lianbang, and others accused Chen Zhengwen and Wu Bingxing of being big bullies and counter-revolutionary elements in court. The personnel in charge of the Nanjing People's Court said: "I only handle civil matters. You should report the counter-revolutionary part to the criminal court or the public security bureau separately." Before a separate case could be reported, the counter-revolutionary element escaped. It was not until the masses reported it again during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries that he was arrested and brought to justice. If those who insist on this set of reactionary "judicial procedures" and "jurisdictional systems" are not intentionally opening a way out for counter-revolutionary elements, giving them a chance to escape, what else are they doing it for?
    In addition, there are many "theories" and "reasons" for exonerating counter-revolutionary elements. For example, Huang Zixian, an old judicial personnel of the People's Court of Hunan Province, reduced the sentence of a counter-revolutionary criminal who had been engaged in special agent activities for a long time before liberation and forged seals and extorted money from the masses after liberation, on the grounds that the criminal "has been harming the people all along, but is still young." The criminal did not receive the punishment he deserved and became even more unscrupulous, organizing three prison breaks and attempting to poison our guards. Huang Zixian, in the case of the trial of counter-revolutionary Su Songyang, even absurdly reduced the sentence on the grounds that he had "low culture, little study time, and insufficient class consciousness." Wu Heyong, a counter-revolutionary criminal in Zhejiang Province, served as a battalion commander in the puppet army, killing our revolutionary comrades Ye Weicheng and others, and also robbed civilians, burned civilian houses, and raped women. After liberation, he was still very reactionary. The prefectural-level court sentenced him to death with a two-year reprieve, which was already lenient. However, Wu Zongqi of the Provincial People's Court reduced the sentence to twelve years in prison during the review, using words such as "the crime is not serious overall." May I ask, what exactly counts as "serious crime"? What is especially reactionary is calling committing counter-revolutionary crimes "job-related crimes" and calling a counter-revolutionary element killing revolutionary personnel while resisting arrest "legitimate defense." If such judicial personnel are not themselves counter-revolutionary elements, then they are the shameful "obligatory lawyers" of counter-revolutionary elements!
    Just imagine, if we cannot eliminate the above-mentioned various extremely reactionary old legal viewpoints from the people's judicial organs and allow them to exist and spread, can our judicial organs be called revolutionary judicial organs of the people? Can they be called weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship? Can they defend the fruits of the people's revolution, strike and suppress the enemies of the revolution? On the contrary, they can only protect the enemy and endanger the revolutionary people! The people of the whole country rise up, thoroughly and ruthlessly expose all judicial personnel who adhere to reactionary old legal viewpoints, and resolutely eliminate reactionary old legal viewpoints!

    旧法观点是怎样包庇了反革命罪犯的
    周增华
    人民法院是人民民主专政的武器，镇压反革命和保护人民是它最根本的任务。但是，有一些司法工作者，尤其是没有经过改造的旧司法人员，却在审判反革命案件时表现了毫无人民立场，敌我不分；甚至是站在敌人方面，直接包庇反革命罪犯，危害国家和人民。
    第一，他们时常援引旧法中的“法律不溯既往”，来宽恕那些解放以前有血债的罪恶深重的反革命分子。他们认为解放前的犯罪“已失时效”，可以“不究”，随意减轻或取消对反革命分子的惩处。川北区反革命犯李定廷在一九三五年当地红军转移后，曾陆续杀死革命干部刘俊等九人，解放后又进行反革命宣传，威吓农民，不让农民参加农会。而川北剑阁分区某人民法院的审判人员在处理此案时，竟认为“被告杀人是在解放前”，“既往不究”，现在只能依据惩治反革命条例第十条第三款以制造和散布谣言论罪。所以只判了三年徒刑，把李犯杀害九条人命的血债一笔勾消了。徐州市反革命犯王金奎，当过蒋匪军的侦缉队长和日伪军的便衣班长，曾亲手枪杀我抗日游击队长赵广友，并杀害自己的妻子；解放后仍继续进行反革命活动，群众恨之入骨。但经公安机关逮捕送交徐州市人民法院后，旧审判人员杨仲轩也以“既往不究”为理由，只轻轻地判了四年徒刑。后经千余群众联名要求严惩，并经当地党政领导机关指责，才改判死刑。谁都知道，在国民党反动统治时期，人民遭受反革命的屠杀，血海深仇，是只能记在心里，无处申诉的。只有在人民掌握了政权的现在，才有可能来追究法办这些凶犯。可是现在竟有人跑出来说：“法律不溯既往”。请问这是站在什么立场说话呢？是要保护谁的利益呢？
    第二，对于阴谋组织暴乱或潜伏待机破坏的反革命分子，当作一般的“预备犯”或“未遂犯”主张从轻惩办，甚至主张“法无明文规定者不罚”。如反革命犯牟均，解放后潜伏在西康省雅安城，组织伪青年军人员，勾结匪首李驎，准备里应外合，攻打雅安城；牟犯并直接负责指挥城内匪徒及内外联络。对这样一个罪恶重大的反革命罪犯，西康省人民法院的审判人员竟以“暴动未遂”为理由，只判处六年徒刑。又如反革命犯阮雄飞，曾历任蒋匪军反动军官多年，解放后仍纠集坏分子，伪造印信，收集长短枪支和六○炮等武器，策划暴乱，密谋颠覆我人民政府，而徐州市人民法院的审判人员亦以“暴乱未遂”为理由，仅判八年徒刑。直至镇压反革命运动时期，才经群众坚决要求，改判死刑。请问：对于那些时常在待机暴动、阴谋颠覆人民政权的反革命罪犯实行宽纵，究竟是何居心？难道一定要等他们颠覆了我们的人民政府、“达到目的”之后再严惩吗？这样做除了使反革命分子在进行破坏活动时更加方便以外，还能有什么别的结果？
    第三，在人民法院中搬用反动法院那一套机械的“司法程序”和“管辖制度”，时常强调什么“非本庭管辖”，“须另案起诉”等等，对反革命罪犯置之不理，任其逍遥法外。如贵阳市一个审判人员在审理一件民事案中，对当事人的一方揭发另一方的反革命活动的罪行，即藉口这是“刑事部分”，须“另行审理”，“自己管不着”，不予受理，使反革命分子趁机脱逃。后幸经书记员报告院长，才追捕归案法办。南京市俞悠兰、尹联邦等在房屋租赁案件中，曾当庭检举对方陈正文、吴炳兴是大恶霸、反革命分子，南京市人民法院承办人员却说：“我只管民事，反革命部分你另向刑庭或公安局告发吧。”在另案告发以前，反革命分子逃了。直到镇压反革命运动时群众再度检举，才捕回法办。坚持这套反动的“司法程序”和“管辖制度”的人，如果不是有意给反革命分子网开一面，使其有机会脱逃，又是为了什么呢？
    此外，还有许多为反革命分子开脱罪责的“理论”和“理由”。例如，湖南省人民法院旧司法人员黄子岘给一个解放前长期从事特务活动、解放后又伪造印信、向群众进行敲诈的反革命犯减轻刑罚，理由是该犯“虽一贯危害人民，但年纪还青”。该犯没有得到应得的惩罚，更肆无忌惮，三次组织越狱，并企图毒杀我看守人员。黄子岘在审判反革命分子苏松杨案时，更荒唐地以“文化过低，学习时间很少，阶级觉悟不够”为理由而予以减刑。浙江省反革命犯吴鹤永曾任伪军营长，杀害我叶维成等二位革命同志，并曾抢劫民财、烧毁民房、强奸妇女，解放后仍很反动。专区级法院判其死刑，缓期两年执行，已属宽大；但该省人民法院吴宗岐在复核时却以“综合该犯罪恶尚非严重”等为词，减处徒刑十二年。试问究竟什么才算“罪情严重”呢？尤其反动的，是把犯反革命罪称为“职务犯罪”，把反革命分子拒捕时杀害革命人员叫做“正当防卫”。这样的司法人员如果本身不是反革命分子，那就是反革命分子的可耻的“义务律师”！
    试想，如果我们不能把以上形形色色的极端反动的旧法观点从人民司法机关中清除出去，而任其存在、散播，我们的司法机关能够称做人民的革命的司法机关吗？能够称做人民民主专政的武器吗？它们能够保卫人民革命的胜利果实、打击与镇压革命的敌人吗？完全相反，它们只能保护敌人，危害革命人民！全国人民起来，彻底地无情地检举揭露一切坚持反动旧法观点的司法人员，坚决肃清反动的旧法观点！
