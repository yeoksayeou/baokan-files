    Due to the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production in recent years, the people's living standards in the entire North China region have greatly improved, leading to an urgent need to raise their cultural level. At the same time, large-scale economic construction is about to begin nationwide, making it imperative to improve the cultural level of workers and peasants in order to better carry out economic construction. The Qi Jianhua rapid literacy method, which has been proven effective in literacy education and raising the cultural level of workers and peasants through experiments in various regions, provides us with the possibility of solving the literacy problem of workers and peasants in a relatively short period. Therefore, it is decided that within the entire North China region, the Qi Jianhua rapid literacy method will be vigorously promoted, and a planned, large-scale literacy campaign will be launched. Party committees at all levels should regard solving the literacy problem of workers and peasants as an important political task, overcome all difficulties with the greatest determination, and carry it out in a planned and led manner, striving to basically solve the problem of illiteracy and semi-literacy among workers and peasants within four to five years. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must lead the mass literacy movement in the same way as they lead other mass movements, take responsibility for solving the various difficulties in this massive undertaking, and oppose obstructing the development of the literacy movement under any pretext. The propaganda departments of the Party, the cultural and educational departments of the government, the propaganda and education departments of various people's organizations, and other forces that can be mobilized should form a large team to carry out the literacy movement. In order to specifically preside over and guide the literacy movement in their respective areas, literacy movement committees should be established at all levels. After the establishment of the North China-level literacy movement committee, it should promptly formulate and implement a plan for promoting the literacy movement throughout the region.

    中共中央华北局关于在华北全区推行祁建华速成识字法，开展扫除文盲运动的决定
    由于几年来工农业生产的恢复和发展，华北全区人民的生活已经大有改善，因而迫切要求提高自己的文化水平，同时全国大规模的经济建设即将开始，为了更好地进行经济建设，也迫切需要提高工农群众的文化水平。祁建华速成识字法，已经各地实验证明，是开展识字教育，提高工农群众文化水平的有效工具，这就使我们已经有了可能在较短时期内来解决工农群众的识字问题。为此决定：在华北全区范围内，大力推行祁建华速成识字法，开展一个有计划的大规模的识字运动。各级党委应将解决工农群众的识字问题，当做一项重要的政治任务，以最大决心克服一切困难，有计划有领导地来进行，争取在四、五年以内，基本上解决工农群众中文盲和半文盲的问题。因此，各级党委必须像领导其他群众运动一样来领导群众的识字运动，负责解决这一巨大工作中的各种困难，反对以任何藉口阻挠识字运动的开展。应将党的宣传部门、政府文教部门、各人民团体的宣传教育部门及其他可以抽调使用的力量，组成一个庞大的队伍，来开展识字运动。为了专责主持和指导所属各地的识字运动，各级应成立识字运动委员会。华北一级的识字运动委员会成立后，应迅速拟订全区推行识字运动的计划，公布施行。
