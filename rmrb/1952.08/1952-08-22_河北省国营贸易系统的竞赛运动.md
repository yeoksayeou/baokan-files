    Competition Movement in the State-Owned Trading System of Hebei Province
    The central requirement of the competition movement in the state-owned trading system of Hebei Province in the third quarter is to purchase wheat, vigorously promote industrial products, and increase production and practice economy by 230 billion yuan.
    This movement in Hebei Province has been fully launched since the beginning of June. The process of its launch is as follows: First, a struggle against capitalist management thinking was carried out among the responsible cadres of state-owned trade, and an inspection against waste was carried out in some areas and units, thereby laying an ideological foundation for the competition movement. In mid-June, focusing on Baoding City, a mobilization meeting for the competition of all state-owned trade employees in the city was held. At the meeting, Xue Xun, Deputy Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, made a mobilization report; in late June, a provincial signing conference for the competition was held. At the meeting, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, both made mobilization reports, and twelve key areas and companies solemnly signed competition agreements. In early July, the Provincial Department of Commerce organized an inspection team of more than 50 people to go to various special districts and cities to inspect and promote the movement, and to solve specific problems in the competition. As of July 15, more than 560 units in the provincial state-owned trading company system participated in the competition, accounting for 80% of the total; among them, 97% to 98% of the units in the department store and local product companies participated in the competition. At present, the morale of employees in various places is high, and many regions and units are challenging each other and holding competition signing conferences. Many units' sections, shares, and even individuals have formulated specific plans. For example, 14 state-owned trade units, 67 groups, and 1,072 people in Tangshan City have all formulated competition plans. Some companies have also signed contact contracts between various sections and shares within the company.
    There has been a significant increase in the completion of purchase and sales plans. In the first half of July, wheat purchases in Hebei Province increased by 127% compared with the second half of June, completing 60% of the monthly plan. As of July 20, the sales volume of department stores has completed 62% of the monthly plan, and it is expected that the full monthly plan can be completed on time (only 60% of the plan was completed in the entire month of June). The sales of slow-selling goods have begun to open up. For example, only more than 100 bicycles could be sold in the past month, but 1,600 bicycles were sold in the first ten days of July. Locally woven towels and steel seed pots that had not left the warehouse for two years have also begun to be sold. These achievements are due to the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees in the competition movement, changing old management styles and work methods, and improving work efficiency.
    Many units have overcome the past style of passively waiting for business and being bureaucratic. In the past, many unit salespeople sat still and often spoke unkindly. Now they are enthusiastic and amiable to buyers, able to introduce the quality and characteristics of products according to customer needs, and try their best to satisfy customers. At the end of June, Baoding Coal Construction Company organized 65 employees to go to 147 units in the rain to contact them, signed supply contracts, and sold more than 9,000 tons of coal, accounting for one-third of the sales volume in May.
    Many units have improved their work methods, and some technical creations and improvements have emerged. For example, the accounting section of the Provincial Salt Industry Company adopted direct recovery, which was one or two days earlier than the previous remittance, and adopted the method of frequent allocation and frequent withdrawal, which reduced cash backlog by more than 50%. The business, planning, and storage and transportation sections of Baoding Grain Company have strengthened their contact, improved storage methods, and adopted methods such as selling grain at the warehouse, collecting wheat at the warehouse, selling flour at the warehouse, transferring the original vehicle, and drawing hemp bag ropes, saving more than 200 million yuan in various expenses in more than 20 days. Comrades from the storage and transportation section of the Provincial Livestock Products Company created a wool soil cleaning machine. In the past, 13 people could clean 4,000 catties of wool per day, and the soil was not completely removed; now it only takes 6 people, and there is no longer any soil in the wool. They are now further studying the conversion of the wool soil machine to electricity. The company has also improved the wool pressing machine, increasing the weight of each package from 130 catties to 150 catties, and reducing the volume by 24%, which has more than doubled the loading capacity of each train car, greatly reducing transportation costs. Baoding Department Store Branch improved the paper cutting machine, increasing the daily paper cutting from 6.7 reams to 16.7 reams, increasing work efficiency by one and a half times.
    Solidarity and mutual assistance among employees have been strengthened. For example, employees of many companies in Shijiazhuang have automatically signed technical contract teaching contracts. The cooks of Baoding Department Store were impatient to take care of patients in the past, but now they propose to take good care of patients to serve the competition. Administrative work efficiency has been significantly improved. For example, before the competition, various companies in Baoding City only cleared two months of backlog accounts in two and a half months. After the competition, the same number of people cleared two and a half months of backlog accounts in only 18 days.
    The above achievements show that the political consciousness of employees has been greatly improved in the competition, and the potential strength of the state-owned trade system has been initially brought into play. At the same time, it proves that the competition movement is an important method to improve trade work and is the central link in completing various trade work tasks at present.
    The competition movement in the state-owned trading system of Hebei Province has gained the following experience. (1) The attention of the Party and the government is the primary key to the development of the competition movement. Without the strong leadership of the Party and government at all levels, it would be impossible for the movement to develop rapidly and comprehensively relying solely on the Provincial Department of Commerce and the store employee union. (2) It is necessary to strengthen political and ideological leadership and overcome ideological obstacles in the movement in a timely manner. At the beginning of the movement, some cadres and employees had a relaxed mood of "taking a break" after the "Three-Anti" campaign, some misunderstood the competition as "doing more work," and some were unwilling to do financial work and unwilling to deal with the bourgeoisie. Only by timely and correctly criticizing and solving these ideological problems of cadres and employees can the movement be carried out smoothly.
    (3) It is necessary to fully mobilize and rely on the masses of employees. In the past, some responsible cadres were not clear enough about the idea of relying on employees, did not pay attention to employees' rationalization proposals, and only organized the competition by increasing labor intensity, so the movement could not be sustained. (4) It is necessary to implement the policy of relying on cooperatives. For example, the Tianjin Special District Department Store Company signed a competition agreement with the cooperative and established business relations with 95% of the grassroots societies in the entire special district. As of July 17, they had completed 88% of the monthly plan, of which the sales amount through grassroots societies reached 68% of the company's total sales amount. (5) It is necessary to make full use of various opportunities to vigorously organize small-scale material exchange meetings. For example, Baodi, Jinghai, and Wuqing counties in Tianjin Special District combined the competition signing conference with the material exchange meeting, and on the spot, the state-owned company group and the grassroots cooperative signed 164 contracts (total amount of 1.2 billion yuan), which were all correct. (6) The business competition movement of the trade department must be closely combined with relevant departments to develop rapidly. The mutual support competition agreements signed between the state-owned trade companies in Baoding City and the cooperatives and transportation departments are a good way to overcome departmentalism and strengthen mutual contact. It is also a good way for state-owned trade, cooperative, banking, transportation, and other departments at all levels in Hebei Province to jointly organize a material exchange competition committee to lead the work in a unified manner. (7) It is necessary to properly solve the welfare problems of employees.

### 河北省国营贸易系统的竞赛运动

    河北省国营贸易系统的竞赛运动
    河北省国营贸易竞赛运动在第三季度的中心要求是收购小麦，大力推销工业品，并增产节约二千三百亿元。
    河北省这一运动从六月初至现在已全面发动起来。其发动过程是：首先在国营贸易的负责干部中进行了一次反资本主义经营思想的斗争，并在部分地区和单位进行了反浪费的检查，从而为竞赛运动打下了思想基础。六月中旬，以保定市为重点，举行了该市全体国营贸易职工的竞赛动员大会，会上省人民政府薛迅副主席作了动员报告；六月下旬，又召开了全省的竞赛签字大会，会上省人民政府杨秀峰主席和中共河北省委书记林铁同志均作了动员报告，并有十二个重点地区与公司隆重地签订了竞赛协议书。七月初，省商业厅组织了五十余人的检查组，分赴各专区、市检查推动，并解决竞赛中的具体问题。截至七月十五日止，全省国营贸易公司系统参加竞赛者共五百六十多个单位，占总数百分之八十；其中百货、土产两公司系统参加竞赛的单位达百分之九十七至九十八。目前各地职工情绪高涨，很多地区和单位相互进行挑战应战，并举行了竞赛签字大会。不少单位的科、股以至个人都制定了具体计划。例如唐山市十四个国营贸易单位、六十七个组、一千零七十二人，全部制订了竞赛计划。有些公司内部各科、股之间并签订了联系合同。
    在购销计划的完成上已有显著增加。七月上半月，河北省收购小麦比六月下半月增加了百分之一百二十七，完成月计划百分之六十。百货销售额，截至七月二十日止，已完成月计划百分之六十二，预计可按时完成全月计划（六月全月仅完成计划百分之六十）。滞销货已开始打开销路。如自行车，过去一个月只能销一百多辆，而七月头十天，就销出一千六百多辆。两年来没出仓库的土织毛巾、钢种盆均已开始有了销路。这些成绩，都是由于广大职工在竞赛运动中发挥积极性、创造性，改变旧的经营作风、工作方法，提高工作效率而获得的。
    许多单位克服了过去坐等生意和机关化的作风，过去许多单位售货员坐着不动，而且多出言不和，现在对买主态度热情和蔼，能根据顾客需要介绍商品质量、特点，尽量使顾客满意。保定煤建公司六月底组织了六十五个职工，冒雨分赴一百四十七个单位联系，签订了供应合同，售出煤炭九千余吨，占五月份销售量的三分之一。
    许多单位改进了工作方法，并出现了一些技术上的创造与改进。如省盐业公司会计科采取了直线回笼，较以前转汇提前了一、二天，并采用勤拨勤领方法，使现金积压降低了百分之五十以上。保定粮食公司业务、计划、储运各科加强了联系，改进了储藏方法，以及采取了就库售粮、就库收麦、就库售面粉、原车调拨、抽麻袋口绳等办法，二十余天节省了各种费用二亿多元。省畜产公司储运科同志创造了羊毛清土机，过去十三人日清毛四千斤，且抖土不净；现仅需六人，且毛内不再夹土。他们现进一步研究将羊毛土机改装电力。该公司又改进了羊毛榨包机，每包重量由一百三十斤增至一百五十斤，体积缩小百分之二十四，使每个车皮装载量增加一倍多，大大减低运费开支。保定百货分公司改进了裁纸机由日裁纸六·七领增至十六·七领，工作效率提高一倍半。
    职工间团结互助加强了。如石家庄不少公司的职工，自动订了技术包教包学合同。保定市百货公司炊事员过去不耐烦照顾病号，现在则提出好好照顾病号为竞赛服务。行政工作效率显著提高，如保定市各公司竞赛前两个半月才清理了两个月的积压账目，竞赛后同样人数仅十八天就清理了两个半月的积压账目。
    上述成绩，说明在竞赛中职工政治觉悟有不少提高，国营贸易系统潜在力量已初步发挥起来。同时，证明了竞赛运动是改进贸易工作的重要方法，是当前完成各项贸易工作任务的中心环节。
    河北省国营贸易系统的竞赛运动获得了如下的经验。（一）党和政府的重视是竞赛运动开展的首要关键。如果没有各级党、政的坚强领导，光靠省商业厅和店员工会，是不可能使运动迅速地全面地开展起来的。（二）必须加强政治思想领导，及时克服运动中的思想障碍。运动开始时，部分干部和职工存在着“三反”后歇歇的松懈情绪，有的把竞赛误解为“多干些活”，有的不愿作财经工作，不愿和资产阶级打交道。只有及时地正确地批判和解决干部和职工这些思想问题，才能使运动顺利开展。
    （三）必须充分发动与依靠职工群众。过去部分负责干部对依靠职工的思想不够明确，对职工的合理化建议不重视，只靠提高劳动强度来组织竞赛，这样运动是不能持久的。（四）必须贯彻依靠合作社的方针。例如，天津专区百货公司与合作社签订了竞赛协议书，并与全专区百分之九十五的基层社建立了业务关系。截至七月十七日，他们已完成月计划百分之八十八，其中通过基层社销货金额达该公司总卖钱额的百分之六十八。（五）必须尽可能利用各种机会，大力组织小型的物资交流会。例如天津专区宝坻、静海、武清三县，把竞赛签字大会与物资交流会结合起来，当场由国营公司小组与基层合作社签订了合同一百六十四件（总金额十二亿元），这都是正确的。（六）贸易部门的业务竞赛运动必须和有关部门密切结合，才能迅速开展。保定市各国营贸易公司之间与合作社及运输部门签定的相互支持竞赛的协议书是克服本位主义和加强互相联系的好办法。河北省各级国营贸易、合作社、银行、交通等部门，共同组织物资交流竞赛委员会，统一领导，也是好办法。（七）必须适当解决职工福利问题。
