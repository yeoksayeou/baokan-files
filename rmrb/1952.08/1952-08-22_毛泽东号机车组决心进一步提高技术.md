    The "Mao Zedong" Locomotive Team Resolves to Further Improve Technology

    Editor: After our "Mao Zedong" locomotive team accepted the challenge from Zheng Xikun in June, due to inadequate preparation and complacency, the locomotive was only in operation for nineteen days in June. Apart from exceeding the challenge target for traction ton-kilometers, all other indicators were not met. After the assistance of higher authorities, we inspected our work, criticized my pride and complacency, and further studied various advanced experiences. Only then did we overfulfill all challenge targets in July. Specifically: we traveled 15,226.2 kilometers, completing 108.8 percent of the plan; traction ton-kilometers reached 221 percent of the plan; average daily locomotive kilometers were 505 kilometers, 101 percent of the plan; and coal savings also exceeded the plan. However, we did not complete the technical speed of freight and material saving plans. This is because we did not sufficiently implement advanced working methods. We plan to seriously study the skills of artisans and operational techniques during the locomotive's overhaul in August, and further strengthen the implementation of various systems within the team to ensure that we can exceed the challenge conditions every month thereafter.

    毛泽东号机车组决心进一步提高技术
    编辑同志：我们毛泽东号机车小组在六月份向郑锡坤应战后，由于准备工作做得不好以及有自满情绪，六月份机车运用仅达十九天，除了超额完成牵引吨公里的应战条件，其他的指标都没完成。经过了上级的帮助，检查了工作，批判了我的骄傲自满情绪，进一步学习了各种先进经验，七月份才超额完成了各种应战指标。计：走行一万五千二百二十六点二公里，完成计划的百分之一百零八点八；牵引吨公里完成计划的百分之二百二十一；平均日车公里为五百零五公里，为计划的百分之一百零一；煤的节省也超过了计划。但是，我们没有完成货物技术速度和材料的节约计划。这是因为我们贯彻执行先进工作方法不够。我们计划在八月份大修机车期间，认真学习工匠化和操纵技术，并进一步加强贯彻组内的各种制度，保证以后每月都能超过应战条件。　郭树德
