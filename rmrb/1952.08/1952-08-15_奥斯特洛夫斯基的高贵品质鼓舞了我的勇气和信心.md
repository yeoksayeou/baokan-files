To the Editor:

    Three months ago, I was diagnosed with tuberculosis, a disease that is currently difficult to treat effectively, and the doctor told me to take a long rest. With a heavy heart, I left my job. I felt like everything was over. What pained me most was that I had worked for the reactionary ruling class for more than ten years in the old society, serving as a tool for their rule over the people. Now that I could serve the people, the illness robbed me of my health!

    During my recuperation, I lay in bed and read, intermittently, Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered," "Born of the Storm," and some essays, speeches, and letters. The author's vivid historical facts of dedicating his life to the struggle for socialist construction deeply moved me. The long-term pain of illness caused him to lose his health, to the point of disability. But the disease did not drain his energy; instead, it stirred his courage, and he worked tirelessly. In a letter to a friend, he said, "I am still alive. Don't mind the illness. I work like a loyal water buffalo from morning till night, until I use up the last bit of strength, knowing that this day has not been wasted." In his life, intense work became the best medicine: "The best and most precious medicine for treating all illnesses is labor." He once swore: "As long as my heart is still beating, I will dedicate my life to the Bolshevik education of the young generations of our socialist motherland until the last beat." (Letter to Stalin). What particularly moved me was that when he was working in the Red Army, the medical committee considered him disabled and unable to work, and issued him a certificate to receive state relief, but he refused to accept it and insisted on working. He felt that he was still useful to the country and could not let the country support him for nothing. What a noble Bolshevik quality of self-sacrifice. Stalin pointed out in his 1924 eulogy for Lenin: "We communists are people of a special character. We are made of special material." Ostrovsky's works gave me a more concrete understanding of the character that communists should have, made me love the Party more, and respect Chairman Mao more. I underlined these moving words in red, added circles and dots, and recited them repeatedly. They greatly inspired my courage and confidence. I firmly believe that I can still serve the people, and that I can contribute my extremely weak strength to the great struggle to build the motherland.

    Ostrovsky's noble qualities greatly encouraged my courage and confidence and helped me fight off the attack of the disease. Now, with light steps and a happy mood, I have returned to my job. Whenever I encounter difficulties at work, or when I show compromise and fear of difficulty, or when I lack energy and show weakness, I think of Ostrovsky's life and what he said, and my courage is strengthened a hundredfold. I will actively participate in work and strive to be a model worker.

### 奥斯特洛夫斯基的高贵品质鼓舞了我的勇气和信心

    奥斯特洛夫斯基的高贵品质鼓舞了我的勇气和信心
    编辑同志：三个月前，我被证实为一个结核病患者，这种病目前还不易于作有效的治疗，医生要我长期休养。我抱着沉重的心情，离开了工作岗位。我感到一切都完了。我特别痛心的是：过去在旧社会里为反动统治阶级工作了十多年，做了他们统治人民的工具，现在，可以为人民服务了，可是病魔却夺去了我的健康！
    在休养期间，我躺在床上，断断续续地读完了奥斯特洛夫斯基的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”“暴风雨所诞生的”两本长篇小说和一些论文、演讲、书信。作者贡献出了毕生精力，为社会主义建设而奋斗的生动史实，使我深受感动。长期病痛的侵袭，使他失去了健康，以至于残废。但疾病并没有吸干他的精力，反而鼓起了他的勇气，他始终是不疲倦地工作着。他给朋友的信中说：“我还活着，病，不用理他，我像一只忠心的水牛一样的工作着，由清晨到深夜，直到用完最后一点力气，深知这一天并未白过。”在他的生活中，紧张的工作成为治病的良方：“医治一切病痛的最好的最宝贵的药品，就是劳动。”他曾这样宣誓过：“只要我的心还在跳动，那么，我这一辈子，将献给对我们社会主义祖国的青年后代的布尔什维克教育事业，直到最后一次心跳为止。”（给斯大林的信）。特别使我感动的是，当他在红军部队工作期间，医疗委员会认为他已残废，不能工作，给予他享受国家救济金待遇的证明书，他不愿接受，仍坚持工作。他觉得他对国家还有用，不能让国家白白养活他。这是何等高贵的布尔什维克的自我牺牲品质。斯大林在一九二四年追悼列宁的演说中指出：“我们共产党员是具有特种性格的人。我们是由特殊材料制成的。”奥斯特洛夫斯基的著作，使我对共产党员应具有的性格有了更具体的认识，更热爱党，更敬爱毛主席。我把这些动人的词句，划了红线，加了圈点，反复地诵读着，它大大地鼓舞了我的勇气和信心，我坚信我还能为人民服务，我还能在为建设祖国的伟大斗争中，贡献出自己极其微弱的力量。
    奥斯特洛夫斯基的高贵品质大大地鼓励了我的勇气和信心，帮助我打退了病魔的进攻。现在，我以轻快的步伐，愉快的心情，重新走上了工作岗位。每当我在工作上遇到困难，表现妥协畏难的时候，每当我精力不够，表现软弱的时候，我想起了奥斯特洛夫斯基的生平和他所说的话，我就百倍地加强了勇气。我要积极地参加工作，争取做一位模范的工作人员。  王景祐
