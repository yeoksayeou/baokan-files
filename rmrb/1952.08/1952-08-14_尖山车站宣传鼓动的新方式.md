    To the Editor: Jianshan Station of the Jiamusi Railway Sub-bureau, in the campaign for full load, exceeding axle weight, and 500 kilometers, created a propaganda and mobilization form of "red flags blooming and bearing fruit," which further developed the past "all-red" competition and improved the production enthusiasm of the workers.

    The past "all-red" competition at this station could only show whether the task was completed or not, and could not show which units exceeded the task or consolidated their achievements. Therefore, some workers believed that "completing the task every day, without accidents, and getting a red flag is enough," and did not actively try to find tricks and create new records.

    In order to change this situation, all the propagandists of the Party branch created a propaganda and mobilization form of "red flags blooming and bearing fruit." The method is to prepare flowers, fruits, and doves of peace. On the basis of the "all-red" competition, if the workers exceed the task by 20%, the propagandists will insert a red flower on their red flag. If the achievement is consolidated for a week, a fruit will be tied on the red flower. If the task is exceeded by 30%, two flowers will be inserted, and two fruits will be tied if the achievement is consolidated for a week. And so on. If the task is exceeded by 60%, a dove of peace will be inserted on the red flag, and their deeds will be written on the "Hero Stage." At the same time, the administration will also give timely rewards.

    This kind of propaganda and mobilization has greatly encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm. In the past, two shunting engines often failed to complete the task, but now only one shunting engine is used to complete the task, and sometimes it can be completed ahead of schedule.

### 尖山车站宣传鼓动的新方式

    尖山车站宣传鼓动的新方式
    编辑同志：佳木斯铁路分局尖山车站在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，创造了“红旗开花结果”的宣传鼓动形式，进一步发展了过去的“满堂红”竞赛，提高了职工的生产积极性。
    这个车站过去的“满堂红”竞赛，只能说明完成任务了没有，而不能表现那些单位是超过了任务或巩固了成绩。因而部分职工认为“每天完成任务，不出事故，得到红旗就行”，而不去积极努力找窍门，创造新纪录。    
    为了改变这种情况，党支部的全体宣传员，创造了“红旗开花结果”的宣传鼓动形式。这个办法是把花、果、和平鸽准备好，在“满堂红”竞赛的基础上，如果工人们超过任务百分之二十，宣传员就在他们的红旗上插上一朵红花，如果成绩巩固了一周，就在红花上结一个果。超过任务百分之三十的开两朵花，巩固成绩一周的，结两个果。依此类推。如果超过任务百分之六十，就在红旗上插一只和平鸽，并把他的事迹写在“英雄台”上，同时，行政方面也及时给予奖励。
    这种宣传鼓动方式，对工人的生产积极性是一个很大的鼓舞。过去有两台调车机，还经常完不成任务，现在只用一台调车机就完成任务了，有时还能提前完成。  佳木斯铁路分局政治处宣传科
