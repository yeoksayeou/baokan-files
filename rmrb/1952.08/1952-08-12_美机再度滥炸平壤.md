Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 11th. American air force planes once again barbarously bombed residential areas of Pyongyang on the morning of the 10th. This is the latest large-scale bloody atrocity committed by the American aggressors in their indiscriminate slaughter of peaceful residents of Pyongyang, following similar bombings on July 11th and August 4th.

　　From about 1:30 AM to 4:00 AM on the 10th, large numbers of American air force heavy bombers carried out a frenzied attack on the densely populated western and central districts of Pyongyang, including the Daetodong-ri area. In order to slaughter more residents, the US planes dropped more than 500 large and small bombs, as well as many fragmentation bombs and time bombs. According to incomplete statistics, 676 houses and earthen shelters of Pyongyang residents were destroyed, large tracts of farmland were bombed, and more than 1,000 peaceful residents were killed or wounded, the vast majority of whom were elderly people, women, and children who were unable to escape in time.

　　The Pyongyang City Rescue Team, personally led by Vice Minister of the Interior Lee Pil-gyu and Park Hoon-il, risked their lives amidst the enemy's frenzied bombing to rescue more than 140 elderly, weak, women, and children who were buried under collapsed walls and rubble. Disregarding the danger, the nurses bandaged the wounds of the injured and sent them to hospitals for treatment. After the bombing, male and female members of the People's Self-Defense Forces, filled with boundless hatred for the American bandits, immediately organized the burial of the bodies of the victims, cleared the rubble, and filled in the roads. Their actions demonstrated the unparalleled heroic and tenacious spirit and firm fighting will of the Korean people.

　　Everyone who has been to Pyongyang knows clearly that the above-mentioned areas which were wildly bombed by the American aerial bandits are areas where workers, peddlers, and suburban farmers of Pyongyang City live. The people of Pyongyang City have held meetings one after another, strongly protesting the atrocities of the American bandits and denouncing the shameless lies of the murderers.

    美机再度滥炸平壤
    【新华社平壤十一日电】美国空军在十日晨对平壤居民区再一次进行野蛮的轰炸。这是美国侵略者继七月十一日、八月四日两次滥炸平壤之后的最近一次大规模屠杀平壤和平居民的血腥暴行。
    在十日晨一时半到四时许，大批美国空军重轰炸机，对人烟稠密的平壤西区和中区大驼岭二里等地，进行疯狂袭击。为了更多地屠杀居民，美机除投下大小炸弹五百多颗外，还投下许多杀伤弹和定时炸弹。据不完全统计，平壤居民的房舍和土窟六百七十六所被炸毁，大片田地被炸烂，和平居民一千多人被炸死炸伤，其中绝大部分是躲避不及的老年人、妇女和儿童。
    平壤市救护队在内务省副相李弼珪、朴勋一亲自率领下，在敌机狂轰滥炸的当时，冒险抢救出被颓垣碎石埋起来的老弱妇孺一百四十多人。看护员们不顾危险，为伤者包扎伤口，送往医院救治。在轰炸过后，人民自卫队的男女队员们怀着对美国强盗的无限仇恨，立即有组织地埋葬牺牲者的尸体、清理废墟、填平道路。他们的行动表现出朝鲜人民无比的英勇顽强精神和坚强的斗争意志。
    所有到过平壤的人们都清楚地知道：美国空中强盗所狂轰滥炸的上述地区是平壤市工人、小贩和市郊农民聚居的地区。平壤市人民纷纷集会，强烈抗议美国强盗的暴行并斥责杀人凶手的无耻谎话。
