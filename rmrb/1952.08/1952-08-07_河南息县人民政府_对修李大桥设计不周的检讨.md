Henan Xixian People's Government
Self-Criticism Regarding the Poor Design of the Xi Li Bridge

To the Editor: The criticism made by comrades Yan Yuanzhong and three others in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on July 9th regarding the poor design of the Xi Li Bridge built in our county is correct.

Our county's Xi-Xin Highway's Xi Li Bridge began design in October last year and was completed by the end of January this year, costing a total of 110,000 jin of grain. However, less than three months after completion, both end wing walls completely collapsed during river water rise. After inspection, there were three reasons: First, the main reason was that the wing walls were too narrow; second, the design did not fully understand the terrain and water conditions, resulting in insufficient designed drainage capacity; third, the contractor in charge, Yu Shaoshan, cut corners and the project quality was very poor. After the bridge collapsed, we went to the area to make a self-criticism to the masses, and the contractor in charge, Yu Shaoshan, also made a self-criticism to the masses for his erroneous behavior of cutting corners. After soliciting the opinions of the masses, we redesigned and rebuilt, completing the project in early July.

The reasons for this wasteful incident, in addition to Yu Shaoshan's poor design and cutting corners during construction, were our irresponsible attitude towards the people's construction endeavors. This is reflected in the fact that we did not thoroughly study the terrain and water conditions with the masses in the area beforehand, but one-sidedly believed in Yu Shaoshan's design, and at the same time, did not conduct strict inspections after construction. Therefore, the people's property suffered unnecessary losses. We sincerely accept this painful lesson and will resolutely overcome these errors in the future.

### 河南息县人民政府  对修李大桥设计不周的检讨

    河南息县人民政府
    对修李大桥设计不周的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报七月九日“读者来信”栏刊载鄢元中等四同志对我县建筑李大桥设计不周的批评是正确的。
    我县息信公路李大桥，于去年十月间开始设计，至今年一月底竣工，共开支粮十一万斤。但竣工未满三月，河水上涨时，两端翼墙全部倒塌。经过检查，有以下三个原因：一、主要是翼墙过窄；二、在设计时对地势水情了解不够，因而设计的排水量不够；三、包工负责人余少山偷工减料，工程质量很差。桥梁倒塌后，我们已到该地向群众作了检讨，包工负责人余少山也向群众检讨了偷工减料的错误行为。我们徵求了群众的意见后，重新设计，重新施工，并于七月初竣工。
    造成这件浪费事件的原因，除了余少山设计得不好，和施工时偷工减料外，是我们对人民建设事业采取不负责任的态度。这表现在：我们事前没有深入该地和群众认真研究地势、水情，而片面相信了余少山的设计，同时，施工后又没有进行严格的检查。因此，使人民财产遭受不应有的损失。我们诚恳地接受这一次沉痛的教训，今后要坚决克服这些错误。    河南省息县人民政府
