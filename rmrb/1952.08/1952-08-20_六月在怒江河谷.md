June in the Nujiang River Valley used to be a time of sorrow, bringing severe famine to the Lisu, Nu, and other fraternal ethnic groups living there. However, this year's June, in every village of the Lisu Autonomous Region of Bijiang County in the Nujiang River Valley, this sorrowful period has ended, and everywhere is filled with the joyful laughter of the people of all ethnic groups. For the first time in their history, the people of all ethnic groups have planted wheat on their own land and achieved a bumper harvest, victoriously overcoming the summer famine.

The Lisu Autonomous Region of Bijiang County is located on the slopes of the Biluo Snow Mountains and Gaoligong Mountains on both sides of the Nujiang River, and is one of the four counties in western Yunnan's Nujiang River Valley where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities. Corn, buckwheat, and potatoes are the main food crops for the people of all ethnic groups throughout the year. However, local farming techniques are very backward. To this day, they do not plow the fields, weed, or apply fertilizer, so the autumn harvest is not abundant, generally only enough to eat for seven or eight months. In addition, the people of all ethnic groups have never had the habit of planting spring crops. Apart from a very few families sporadically sowing a little spring potato and early-maturing corn, only a few dozen families in each district plant barley, and most of this barley is used for brewing wine. Therefore, during the spring harvest season in May and June, the Nujiang River Valley is a time when food is extremely scarce and the summer famine is extremely severe. The vast majority of the people of all ethnic groups have to rely on grass roots and wild vegetables to sustain their lives. Since liberation, the lives of the people of all ethnic groups in the Nujiang River Valley have improved greatly, but the annual summer famine has not been fundamentally resolved. In order to fundamentally solve this serious historical disaster, the People's Government of the Lisu Autonomous Region of Bijiang County organized more than 300 Lisu and Nu youths before last year's autumn harvest and transported 16,000 jin of wheat seeds from Lanping, preparing to plant them widely throughout the region.

In early October, the wheat sowing season was approaching. The Autonomous Region People's Government convened a meeting of representatives of farmers of all ethnic groups, repeatedly explaining to them the benefits of planting wheat and the reliable conditions for planting wheat in the region, and distributed all the wheat seeds to the farmers of all ethnic groups in the county as relief grain, calling on everyone to plant a widespread trial.

At that time, many farmers had great concerns in their minds. They were deeply afraid that the wheat would not sprout after being planted, or that if it was not planted well, they would not harvest any grain. Because no one had ever planted wheat in the Nujiang River Valley, they did not know how to plant it at all. In response to these ideological concerns of the masses, the Autonomous Region People's Government sent cadres to various districts to provide specific guidance, giving them detailed introductions to the Han people's experience in sowing wheat, organizing them to learn from those families who had planted barley, and mobilizing those farmers with barley planting experience to help them on the spot, completely solving the technical difficulties of everyone not knowing how to plant wheat. As a result, more than 38% of the families in the county tried planting wheat, sowing a total of 1,295 mu.

Because everyone adopted the advanced farming methods of the Han people: plowing the land well, harrowing it level, changing broadcasting to strip planting, and generally weeding one or two times, all the wheat seedlings grew taller than people. Not only was the trial planting successful in all villages in the county, but the first planting also yielded an unexpected bumper harvest, with an average harvest of about 400 jin of wheat per mu of slope land. For example, He Benpu, a Lisu farmer in the fifth district of Bijiang County, only planted half a sheng of wheat seeds this year and harvested five and a half dou of wheat (each dou equals 50 jin). Deng Anai, another Lisu farmer in the fifth district, obtained an even higher harvest. He harvested more than one shi of wheat with two and a half sheng of wheat seeds, creating a grain yield record never before seen in the history of the Nujiang River Valley.

The bumper wheat harvest has changed the face of the Nujiang River Valley. The people of all ethnic groups in the Lisu Autonomous Region of Bijiang County have basically overcome the serious summer famine that has lasted for many years. They are generally eating the newly harvested wheat and no longer need to eat grass roots and wild vegetables.

June in the Nujiang River Valley has now become a joyful time. On every hillside in the Lisu Autonomous Region of Bijiang County, there are groups of Lisu, Nu, and Minjia men and women busily and joyfully weeding in the cornfields, or hurriedly plowing the wheat fields that have just been harvested. This year's bumper wheat harvest has made them deeply aware of the benefits of advanced farming techniques, and they are determined to step up their learning of the advanced production experience of the Han people. Many people are already weeding the corn for the second or third time. Everyone's face is full of happy smiles, and hearty laughter and joyful songs accompany their tense labor throughout the day, floating in the Nujiang River Valley. They sing praises to the bumper wheat harvest, praise the vigorous growth of the corn, and enthusiastically sing about the beginning of a happy life for the people of all ethnic groups in the Nujiang River Valley.

    六月在怒江河谷
    新华社记者  唐西民
    六月，在云南怒江河谷，过去一向是使人愁苦的日子，它每年给这里的傈僳、怒族等各兄弟民族同胞带来了严重的饥饿。然而，今年的六月，在怒江河谷碧江县傈僳族自治区的每一个村子里，这种使人愁苦的日子已经完结了，到处都充满了各族人民底愉快的欢笑。各族人民今年有史以来第一次在自己的土地上种上了小麦，而且得到了丰收，胜利地战胜了夏荒。
    碧江县傈僳族自治区位于怒江两岸碧罗雪山和高黎贡山的山坡上，是云南西部怒江河谷的四个少数民族聚居县之一。包谷，荞子和洋芋，是这里各族人民一年到头的主要食粮。但是当地耕作技术非常落后，至今还不犁田，不锄草，不施用肥料，这样秋粮的收成就不丰富，一般的只能够吃七、八个月。加上各族人民过去都没有栽种小春作物的习惯，除极少人家零星撒种一点春洋芋和早熟包谷外，每区只有几十户人家种大麦，而这些大麦又多半是为了煮酒用的。因此，每年五六月间小春作物收获季节，在怒江河谷，却正是粮食空前缺乏，夏荒极其严重的时候，绝大多数的各族人民都不得不依靠草根、野菜来维持生活。一年一度的饥饿灾难，就这样一年又一年的磨难着怒江河谷的各族人民。解放以来，怒江河谷各族人民的生活，虽然已经有了很大改善，可是，每年的夏荒并没有得到基本解决。为了从根本上解决这个严重的历史灾难，碧江县傈僳族自治区人民政府就在去年秋收之前，组织了三百多个傈僳和怒族青年，从兰坪运回来一万六千斤麦种，准备在全区广泛栽种。
    十月初，小麦播种季节快要来到了。自治区人民政府召开了各族农民代表会议，向他们再三说明栽种小麦的好处，和在本区栽种小麦的可靠条件，并把麦种全部作为救济粮发给全县的各族农民，号召大家普遍试种。
    当时，在许多农民的心里都存在着很大的顾虑，他们深怕麦子种下去生不出来，或是种的不好收不到什么粮食。因为怒江河谷历来从没有人种过小麦，他们一点儿都不晓得究竟应该怎样种。针对着群众的这些思想顾虑，自治区人民政府派出干部分赴各区进行具体指导，给他们详细介绍了汉族同胞播种小麦的经验，并组织他们向那些种过大麦的人家学习，发动那些有种大麦经验的农民来实地帮助他们，彻底解决了大家不会种小麦的技术困难。结果，全县百分之三十八以上的人家都试种了小麦，一共播种了一千二百九十五亩。
    由于大家都采用了汉族的先进耕作方法：把地犁好，耙平，将撒播改为条播，并且普遍都锄过了一两遍草，所有的麦苗都长得比人还高，不但在全县各村到处都试种成功，而且第一次栽种就获得了意外的丰收，每亩坡地平均收获小麦四百斤左右。如碧江县五区傈僳族农民和本普，今年只种了升半麦种，就收了五斗半小麦（每斗合五十市斤）。五区的另一个傈僳族农民登阿奶获得了更高额的收成，他以二升半麦种收获了一石多小麦，创造了怒江河谷历史上从来未有的粮食丰产纪录。
    小麦的丰收，改变了怒江河谷的面貌。碧江县傈僳族自治区的各族人民今年已基本上克服了多少年来的严重夏荒，他们普遍都吃着刚收割下来的新麦，不再需要吃草根和野菜了。
    六月，在怒江河谷，如今已变成了欢乐的日子。在碧江县傈僳族自治区的每一个山坡上，到处都有成群集队的傈僳、怒族和民家族男女同胞，正在包谷地里紧张愉快地锄草，或是赶忙翻犁着那些刚收割完了的麦田。今年小麦的丰收已使他们深刻的认识到了先进耕作技术的好处，他们决心要加紧学习汉族同胞的先进生产经验，很多人已经是在第二、第三遍锄包谷了。他们每个人的脸上都充满了愉快的笑容，纵情的欢笑和快乐的歌声，整天伴随着紧张的劳动飘扬在怒江河谷，他们歌颂小麦的丰收，赞美包谷的旺盛，他们热情欢唱着怒江河谷各族人民幸福生活的开始。
