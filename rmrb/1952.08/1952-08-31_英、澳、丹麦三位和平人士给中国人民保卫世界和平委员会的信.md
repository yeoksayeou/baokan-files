Some time ago, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace distributed a booklet entitled "Shall Brothers Be...?" to peace activists in various countries. The main content of the booklet was articles and letters written by dozens of American and British prisoners of war, describing the humane treatment they received in our prisoner-of-war camps. This booklet was welcomed and valued by peace activists in various countries. Recently, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace received letters from Vakgendy, an employee of the Illawarra Peace Committee in Australia, Arthur Chung Bur, a member of the Esperanto Peace Committee in the United Kingdom, and Karl Shaw Ruan Sen of Copenhagen, Denmark. The letters described the condemnation of the American invasion of Korea by peace-loving people in various countries, as well as their activities in the cause of peace. The letters were filled with the friendship and respect of the people of various countries for the Chinese people. They all hope to learn more about the new China. Excerpts of the original translations are published below:

I. Letter from Vakgendy of Australia

I liked this booklet very much, mainly because it fully demonstrated the most basic Christian concept of "returning good for evil." This concept is often used when preaching in capitalist countries, but it has never been practiced. Indeed, there has rarely been an attempt to correct and eliminate the factors that breed evil. In our modern world, the greatest evil is germ warfare being waged in North Korea and Northeast China. The Illawarra Peace Committee—of which I am an employee—recently strongly protested the evil acts of American troops in conducting germ warfare in some areas of your country. We have sent this protest to our federal government and the United Nations Secretariat. In these protests, we talked about the United Nations' heinous act of adopting germ warfare—this is the ultimate in ugliness, the most extreme ugliness. We also recognize the ugliness of the Korean War itself, which is the base of ultimate ugliness; we further recognize that the excuse created by the United States for aggression caused the war, which is what John Pratt (who was dismissed from the University of London and the Far East Affairs Advisor of the British Foreign Office) called "the lie that led to the war," which refers to the United Nations condemning North Korea as the aggressor… Despite the confused ideas of many of our people, they are increasingly understanding the truth about British and American foreign policy. Dr. Bolton, who recently led a delegation to the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and the representatives he led held a large gathering. Despite the government's efforts to suppress them, it only further exposed their faces. The prosecutor's office prohibited the screening of films about germ warfare brought back by the representatives, confiscated the documents they brought back, and some local councils prohibited them from using auditoriums, etc. In any case, the power of the masses is strong, and the peace movement is growing. Although the Sydney City Council did not allow Dr. Bolton to borrow the South Town Hall, he still gave a speech to 1,500 people at the Theatre Royal last week, and then gave a speech to 1,000 workers at the Islington Railway Factory (Newcastle), which was the largest gathering in this factory since the war.

The Illawarra Peace Committee pays tribute to the great construction cause of the Chinese people. Your people have freed themselves from the chaos of past wars, corruption, exploitation, feudalism, and decline, and are building a new peaceful world for themselves—we pay tribute to your efforts, perseverance, and progress; more importantly, we express our sympathy for the price you have paid. At the same time, we are honored by your lofty struggle for peace, truth, justice, and "human brotherhood."

Many people have asked me for your booklet. I would be grateful if you could send me a few more copies.

II. Letter from Arthur Chung Bur of the United Kingdom

Thank you very much for the booklet you sent me not long ago. I have read it and lent it to my friends to read.

If this booklet is a true record of the treatment our prisoners of war received in Korea—and I have no reason to doubt it—then the Chinese people will eventually win the eternal praise of the Western people after this shameful war is over.

I think there are really many ordinary people, relatives and friends of our soldiers, who do not understand the war in Korea. The level of political education is very low, and the propaganda for continuing and expanding the war is terribly abundant. Even so, it is impossible to completely obscure the horrors of war, or the lack of moral principles of those so-called "free countries," from the eyes of our people. For example, we know that some people in our army almost used mutiny to oppose some of the cruel acts we committed in Korea. At the same time, the delay in peace talks also reflects the lack of good faith of the American or United Nations negotiators.

Unfortunately, few people deeply care about the work done by the United Nations. People have roughly realized that the United Nations is manipulated by the United States, but they have not realized how other Western countries have hindered the United Nations from developing into a tool for world peace. They agreed to refuse your great country to join the United Nations, and did not understand that this would fuel the danger of a Third World War.

Of course, the peace movement exists in Britain, and it carries out activities from political, religious, trade union, friendly association, and peace committee aspects. We will continue to work to enable the people of our two countries to break through the current difficulties and unite in friendship.

I express my most sincere respect for your work in the cause of world peace.

III. Letter from Karl Shaw Ruan Sen of Denmark

We have received the booklets you sent. Some of my colleagues have read them and discussed their contents with others. They are very useful. I would be grateful if I could get some future publications.

Unfortunately, few Danish workers understand any foreign languages. Today I discussed this issue with a friend who works in a factory in Copenhagen with 3,000 workers, and we agreed that many Danish workers are very interested in your country. He found that pictorial materials particularly aroused their interest. Two illustrated Chinese magazines he was holding, with a large color portrait of Mao Zedong printed on the front page, were widely circulated and cherished by the workers, and eventually stayed with them.

The language of pictures is universal, and we believe that through these pictures, Danish workers will have the opportunity to understand the new China. This will further promote peaceful and friendly relations. Therefore, I decided to write to you to ask if you could get us this kind of material—especially posters, reproduced photographs, illustrated magazines, etc.

### 英、澳、丹麦三位和平人士给中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的信

    英、澳、丹麦三位和平人士
    给中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的信
    不久以前，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会向各国和平人士分发了一本小册子“ShallBrothers    Be……”。小册子的主要内容是几十个美、英战俘所写的文章和信件，叙述他们自身在我方战俘营中所受的人道待遇。这本小册子得到了各国和平人士的欢迎和重视。最近中国人民保卫世界和平委员会收到了澳大利亚伊罗华拿和平委员会职员伐克坚地、英国世界语和平委员会委员亚瑟·郑伯、丹麦哥本哈根的卡尔·邵阮生的来信。信里叙述了各国爱好和平人士对美国侵朝战争的谴责，以及他们从事保卫和平运动的一些情况。信里洋溢着各国人民对中国人民的友情与敬意。他们都希望更多地了解新中国。现将原信译文摘要发表于下：
    一、澳大利亚伐克坚地的信
    我很喜欢这本小册子，主要是因为它充分地证明了最基本的“以善报恶”的基督观念。这种观念在资本主义国家里传教的时候，是常常用到的，然而从来没有实行过。向来的确是很少设法来纠正与消除那些使罪恶滋长的因素的，在我们现代的世界里，最大的罪恶就是在北朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战。伊罗华拿和平委员会——我是这委员会的一个职员——最近有力地抗议美国军队在你们国内某些地区进行细菌战的罪恶行为。我们已把这个抗议书寄到我们的联邦政府与联合国秘书处。在这些抗议书内我们谈到联合国采用细菌战的丑恶行为——这是丑恶的绝顶，丑恶的最绝顶。我们也认识到朝鲜战争本身的丑恶，这就是丑恶绝顶的基地；我们更认识到美国为侵略而创造的藉口引起了战争，这就是约翰·布拉特（他被解除了伦敦大学的职务及英国外交部的远东事务顾问）所说的“导致战争的谎言”，这谎言就是指联合国谴责北朝鲜为侵略者的……。尽管我们人民有不少混乱的想法，然而他们越来越明白了英美外交政策的真相。曾在最近率领代表团参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的博尔顿博士和他所领导的代表们举行了很大的集会。尽管我们的政府极力镇压，只不过是进一步地暴露他们的面目。检察处禁止放映代表们带回来的有关细菌战的电影，没收了他们带回来的文件，有些地方的议会禁止他们使用礼堂等等。不管怎么样，群众的力量是强大的，和平运动是生长着的。虽然悉尼市议会没有允许博尔顿博士借用南城市政厅，他上星期还是在天路尼戏院对一千五百人作了演讲，后来又在斯令顿铁路工厂（纽卡斯尔）对一千工人作了演讲，这是战后在这工厂里最大的集会。
    伊罗华拿和平委员会向中国人民伟大的建设事业致敬。你们的人民摆脱了过去的战争、腐败、剥削、封建与衰败的混乱现象，正在给自己建立着一个新的和平世界——我们向你们的努力、坚忍、进步致敬；更重要的是对你们所付出的代价表示同情。同时，我们对于你们为和平、真理、正义与“人类兄弟般的友爱”而进行的崇高斗争感到光荣。
    有很多人向我要你们的小册子。假如你能再给我寄几本来，则不胜感激。
    二、英国亚瑟·郑伯的信
    非常感谢不久以前你们寄给我那本小册子。我读过了而且还借给我的朋友读。
    如果这本册子是我们战俘在朝鲜所受到的待遇的真实记载——我没有理由怀疑这一点——那么在这个可耻的战争结束以后，中国人民最后一定会赢得西方人民永远的称赞的。
    我想，实在有很多普通的人，我国士兵的亲戚和朋友，还不了解在朝鲜的战争。政治教育的水准非常之低，而继续战争和扩大战争的宣传却多得可怕。虽然这样，要在我国人民眼前完全遮住战争的恐怖，或者遮住那些所谓“自由国家”缺乏道义原则的事实是不可能的。例如，我们知道，我们的军队中有些人几乎用叛变来反对我们这方面在朝鲜所作的某些残忍的行为。同时，和谈的拖延也反映了美国的或联合国的谈判代表们缺乏信义。
    不幸得很，很少人深切地关心于联合国所做的工作。人们大约已经了解到联合国为美国所操纵，但是，他们却没有了解到其他西方国家怎样地阻碍了联合国发展成为世界和平的工具。它们同意拒绝你们的伟大国家参加联合国，而并不了解这会助长第三次世界大战的危险。
    当然，和平运动在不列颠是存在着的，它从政治、宗教、工会、友好协会以及和平委员会等等方面来展开活动。我们将继续努力，使我们两国人民得以冲破目前的重重困难而友好团结。
    我对你们在世界和平事业方面的工作表示最诚恳的敬意。
    三、丹麦卡尔·邵阮生的信
    我们收到了你们寄来的小册子。我的一些同事们阅读了并与别人讨论了它们的内容。它们是十分有用的。如果我再能得到一些将来出版的刊物，我将不胜感激。
    不幸很少丹麦工人懂得任何外国语文。今天我和一个在哥本哈根某拥有三千工人的工厂里工作的朋友讨论了这个问题，我们一致认为许多丹麦工人对你们的国家发生很大的兴趣。他发现图片材料特别引起他们的兴趣。他拿着的两本有插图的中国杂志，首页印有巨幅的毛泽东彩色像，被工人们广泛地传阅并珍视，最后就留在他们那里了。
    图片的语言是举世皆通的，我们相信通过这些图片，丹麦工人将有机会了解新中国。这会更加促进和平与友好的关系。因此我决定写信给你们，问问你们是否能使我们得到这类材料——尤其是招贴画、复制的照片、有插图的杂志等。
