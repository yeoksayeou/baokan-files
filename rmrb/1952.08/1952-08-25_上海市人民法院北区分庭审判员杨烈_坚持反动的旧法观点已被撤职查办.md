Editor's Note: In people's courts across the country, many old judicial personnel who were retained and judicial cadres who were influenced by reactionary laws hold strong old legal views, which seriously harm the interests of the people when handling cases. The case of Yang Lie, a judge of the North District Tribunal of the Shanghai Municipal People's Court, who refused to accept Tan Su-yun's legitimate request for divorce and defended the feudal husbandly power interests of a counter-revolutionary element, is a prominent example. The Shanghai Municipal People's Court has now dismissed Yang Lie and initiated an investigation.

Tan Su-yun's Letter to the Shanghai Liberation Daily Editor:

I am very dissatisfied with the handling of my divorce case by Yang Lie, a judge of the North District Tribunal of the Shanghai Municipal People's Court. I am writing to you about the situation in the hope of obtaining a reasonable resolution.

I married Lu Xiao-dong (陆效东) in Chongqing in 1945. In August 1948, he went to the United States to study. After liberation, when I saw batches of students returning from the United States overcoming all obstacles and joyfully returning to the beloved and liberated motherland, I also hoped that he would return, study hard, reform himself, and serve the people. In early 1950, I received a letter from him stating that his passport in the United States was about to expire, so I ran around to handle the entry procedures for him. In April, I sent him the completed entry permit and sent a telegram, hoping for his return. But he wrote back saying that he would not return to the motherland, but would go to Taiwan to serve Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits. This fully demonstrated his reactionary thinking and he had not a trace of Chinese character. The following is part of his letter:

"…Yesterday, Mr. Cheng Tian-fang (程天放) from Taiwan replied, allowing me to return to Taiwan… I may not see you this time, and you must take some responsibility for that. When Shanghai was evacuated, you only cared about your parents and were unwilling to go to Taipei, which was also a mistake. …Many Chinese students want to harm me, and they want to force me to the mainland… This is an extraordinary event and not my intention… I grant you freedom of action (meaning freedom of marriage)… If you are smart and capable, you should think of going to Taiwan after the fall of Shanghai and Sichuan…"

He calls Cheng Tian-fang, a remnant element of the Kuomintang bandits, "Mr."; he considers the liberation of Shanghai and Sichuan as "fall"; he calls escaping to Taiwan "smart and capable"; he says that I did not want to follow the Kuomintang in fleeing, which was called a "mistake"; and he shamefully slanders the progressive Chinese students in the United States.

Originally, he was a Kuomintang member before he went to the United States. During his years at the pseudo-Shanghai Central Trust Bureau, he had done Kuomintang party work. Before liberation, he knew that my younger brother had joined the revolution, and he said: "I will never coexist with your younger brother."

After liberation, I have received a certain amount of revolutionary education. Seeing his letter and thinking of his previous reactionary words and deeds, I realized that I and he are politically incompatible. Based on the above reasons, I applied to the North District Tribunal of the Municipal People's Court in June 1951 to divorce Lu Xiao-dong.

Now my understanding is higher than before. Looking back at the handling of my divorce case by Yang Lie, a judge of the North District Tribunal, I feel that it is intolerable! He completely lost the position that a people's judge should have, and could not even distinguish between the people and counter-revolutionary elements. The questions he asked me during the interrogation are good proof. He completely ignored the main reason for my divorce request—Lu Xiao-dong's reactionary political and ideological views—but spent a great deal of energy and time asking me the following unimportant questions: "What is your relationship with Lu?" "When did he go to the United States?" "How did you two get together?" "How was your relationship after marriage?" "Did you have any children after marriage?"… I told him the reasons for requesting a divorce and showed him Lu's letter, but the answer I got was: "Looking at the letter, your feelings haven't reached the point of final rupture"; "You two married freely, and he seems to have good feelings for you in the letter." I repeatedly explained the reasons, but he replied: "There is no way to understand, and I cannot handle it based on your side alone." He even said: "Even if he is a counter-revolutionary element, you have to request a disposition after he is sentenced." Is this what a people's judge should say?

The result of the case was: "This case cannot be heard based on your side alone. There is no way to investigate your usual relationship, so it can only be suspended temporarily." Heavens! Lu Xiao-dong's political and ideological views are so reactionary, and now his whereabouts are unknown (he has not written since September 1950). How can both sides be heard?

According to Article 17 of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China: "If both the man and the woman voluntarily apply for a divorce, the divorce shall be granted. If one of the man and the woman insists on a divorce, and mediation by the district people's government and judicial organs is ineffective, the divorce shall also be granted." My husband agrees to the divorce, so why can't it be ruled? I feel that Judge Yang Lie's handling of my divorce case is completely inconsistent with the people's laws and inconsistent with reason. Obviously, he still maintains a reactionary stance, ideology, and views! He ignores the difference between revolution and counter-revolution, rejects the just demands of revolutionary women, defends the feudal husbandly power interests of counter-revolutionaries, and loses the most basic qualities of a people's judge. The Liberation Daily is the newspaper of the Communist Party, and I firmly believe that it will definitely speak for the people and make this case receive a reasonable resolution. I believe that a judge like Yang Lie, who has a reactionary stance and disregards the interests of the people, should be punished.

Sincerely,
Tan Su-yun

### 上海市人民法院北区分庭审判员杨烈  坚持反动的旧法观点已被撤职查办

    上海市人民法院北区分庭审判员杨烈
    坚持反动的旧法观点已被撤职查办
    编者按：在各地人民法院中有许多留用的旧司法人员和受了反动法律影响的司法干部，有着浓厚的旧法观点，在处理案件中严重地损害了人民的利益。上海市人民法院北区分庭审判员杨烈拒不接受谭素芸正当的离婚要求，维护反革命分子的封建夫权利益，是一个突出的例子。现上海市人民法院已将杨烈撤职查办。
    谭素芸给上海解放日报的信编辑同志：
    我对上海市人民法院北区分庭审判人员杨烈受理我所提出的离婚案的处理，很不满意。现在我把经过情形写给你们，希望能得到合理的解决。
    我和陆效东于一九四五年在重庆结婚。一九四八年八月他去美国留学。解放以后，当我看到一批批留美学生突破一切阻碍，欢乐地回到可爱的解放了的祖国时，我也期望他能回来，好好学习，改造自己，为人民服务。一九五○年初我接到他来信，说他在美护照快满期，我便东奔西走为他办理入境手续。四月间我把办妥的入境许可证寄给他，并拍了电报，盼望他归来。而他竟来信说不回祖国，要到台湾为蒋介石残匪服务去。这充分表现了他的反动思想，简直没有一点中国人的气味。下面是他信中的一部分：
    “……昨天台湾方面已有程天放先生之回信，允许我返台，……此次或不能见你，你也要负一部分责任。上海撤守，你只要父母亲而不愿赴台北，这也是失策。……许多中国同学要害我，他们并要迫我到大陆……事出非常，并非我故意为之……准许你自由行动（意指婚姻自由）……假使你聪明有为，你应想到上海沦落及四川失守后到台湾……”
    他把国民党残匪分子程天放称呼“先生”；对上海、四川的解放竟认为“沦落”；把逃到台湾称之谓“聪明有为”；我不愿跟着国民党逃，竟说是“失策”；并且可耻地诬蔑在美国的我国进步学生。
    原来他去美国以前已是国民党员，在伪上海中央信托局的几年工作中，曾做过国民党的党务工作。解放前他知道我弟弟参加革命，曾说过：“我和你弟弟不共戴天。”
    解放后，我已受到了一定的革命教育，看到他的信，联想到他以前的反动言语与行为，我和他在政治上已是水火不相容的了。基于以上原因，我在一九五一年六月向本市人民法院北区分庭要求和陆效东离婚。
    现在我的认识比以前提高了。回想起北区分庭审判人员杨烈对我要求离婚案件的处理，感到不能容忍！他完全失去了人民审判员应有的立场，连人民与反革命分子也不能区别。他在讯问我时所提出的问题，就是很好的证明。他对我提出离婚的主要理由——陆效东在政治上思想上的反动，完全不关心，却不惜化费很大的精力和时间来问我如下无关紧要的问题：“陆和你是何关系？几时他到美国？”“你们俩如何结合的？”“婚后感情如何？”“婚后生过子女吗？”……我把要求离婚的理由告诉他，把陆的信给他看，但得到的回答是：“看信，你们感情没有到最后决裂的地步”；“你们是自由结合的，信上他对你感情还好”。我又再三说明原由，而他却回答说：“没有办法了解，不能随你一方处理。”甚至他竟说：“即使他是反革命分子，也得在他判刑后才能请求处理。”这像是人民审判人员所说的话吗？
    案件处理的结果是：“本案不能听你一方所言，对于你们俩平时感情无从调查，只能暂行中止。”天哪！陆效东政治思想上那样反动，现在又不明他的下落（一九五○年九月以后一直没有来过信），试问怎么能听双方之言呢？
    根据中华人民共和国婚姻法第十七条的规定：“男女双方自愿离婚的，准予离婚。男女一方坚决要求离婚的，经区人民政府和司法机关调解无效时，亦准予离婚。”而我的丈夫是同意离婚的，为什么不能判决呢？我觉得杨烈审判员对我的离婚案的处理是完全不合乎人民法律，不合乎情理的。很明显的，他还保持着反动的立场、思想和观点！他不管革命和反革命的区别，拒绝革命妇女正义的要求，维护了反革命的封建夫权利益，失去了人民审判员的起码品质。解放日报是共产党的报纸，我深信它一定能替人民说话，使得这个案件能够得到合理的解决。我认为像杨烈这样立场反动、不顾人民利益的审判员，应受到处分。此致敬礼　谭素芸
