The Great Victory of the Hungarian People
    ——Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Promulgation of the Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic
    August 20th is the third anniversary of the promulgation of the Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic. The Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic, adopted in 1949, is the victorious fruit of the Hungarian people's long struggle for people's democracy, socialism, and a happy life. It reflects the fundamental changes that have taken place in Hungary's domestic political, social, and economic structures since its liberation with the assistance of the Soviet army, and it establishes Hungary's firm and unwavering direction toward socialism. In the three years since the promulgation of the constitution, the Hungarian people have victoriously continued to advance towards socialism along the path of people's democracy.
    On April 4, 1945, the great Soviet army liberated Hungary from the enslavement of German fascism, crushed the regime of Hungarian landlords and capitalists, and opened the path to socialism for the Hungarian people. As early as October 1944, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Hungarian people organized the Hungarian National Independence Front, which included various democratic parties, to carry out the struggle for national liberation and democracy. In December of the same year, elections were held in the liberated Hungarian territory, and a provisional People's Assembly was elected and a provisional government was established. After liberation, under the leadership of the Hungarian Communist Party and the people's leader Rakosi, the Hungarian people carried out the struggle to crush the counter-revolutionary activities of the reactionaries supported by foreign imperialists and to establish and consolidate the people's democratic system. In November 1945, elections to the National Assembly were held in accordance with the new election law. The newly elected National Assembly announced on February 1, 1946, the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Hungarian Democratic Republic. In May 1949, the third National Assembly election was held after liberation, and 96.15 percent of the voters voted to support the candidates of the National Independence Front. On August 20 of the same year, the National Assembly executed the will of the people, unanimously adopted the Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic, declared Hungary a people's democratic republic, and fixed Hungary's national policy of advancing toward socialism.
    The Constitution stipulates that the Hungarian People's Republic is a state of workers and working peasants, and all power belongs to the working people. The highest state power organ and local power organs at all levels are elected by the working people according to the principles of universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot, and the right to recall unqualified representatives can be exercised. In the elections of local power organs at all levels held on October 22, 1950, in accordance with the Constitution, 96.9 percent of the voters exercised their rights and elected 220,000 representatives and alternate representatives. 97.8 percent of the voters who cast their ballots supported the candidates put forward by the People's Democratic Front, supported the people's democratic system, and supported the Hungarian Working People's Party that led them towards socialism.
    The Constitution defines the new foundation of Hungary's social and economic structure. The land, all natural resources, means of transportation, postal and telecommunications services, banks, and state-owned agricultural enterprises of the Hungarian People's Republic are all state property, that is, property of the whole people. The Constitution recognizes and protects personal property acquired through labor and guarantees the right of inheritance. At the end of 1949, Hungary announced that it would nationalize enterprises employing more than ten workers and enterprises held by foreign capital, completing the work of industrial nationalization and creating decisive conditions for ensuring the implementation of the national economic plan.
    The Constitution defines and protects the rights of working peasants to land. The state promotes the development of socialist agriculture by establishing state-owned farms and agricultural machinery stations, and by helping to establish agricultural production cooperatives according to the principles of voluntariness and joint labor through various means. With the comprehensive assistance of the state, the socialist sector in agriculture accounted for one-quarter of the country's cultivated land area by the end of last year; in the second quarter of this year, the cultivated land area of state-owned farms increased by 41.4 percent compared with last year, and the cultivated land area of agricultural production cooperatives increased by 37 percent.
    The Constitution stipulates that the economic life of the Hungarian People's Republic shall be guided by the national economic plan in order to develop productive forces, increase national wealth, improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people, and strengthen national defense. In 1949, Hungary completed the three-year plan for the restoration and development of the national economy ahead of schedule, making the total industrial output exceed the pre-war level by 53 percent, and the proportion of industry in the national income increased from 32.8 percent in 1938 to 49.2 percent. From 1950, Hungary began to implement a five-year plan to promote national industrialization and lay the foundation for socialism. The expanded five-year plan in 1951 stipulated that Hungary's industrial production would double in five years, heavy industry would quadruple, light industry would increase by one and a half times, and the ratio of industrial and agricultural production would be eighty to twenty. Production is increasing year by year. In 1950, industrial production exceeded 1949 by 35 percent, and in 1951 it increased by 30.1 percent, and in the second quarter of this year it increased by 23.5 percent compared with the same period last year.
    The Constitution stipulates that the people have the right to work, the right to rest, and the right to receive state assistance when they lose their ability to work. The Constitution also stipulates that the Hungarian People's Republic implements the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." As early as during the three-year plan, Hungary had already eliminated unemployment. During the five-year plan, the number of workers will increase by 600,000 to 650,000. In 1950, the living standards of Hungarian workers and staff had increased by 87 percent compared with the pre-war year of 1938. At the end of 1951, Hungary abolished the rationing system, adjusted prices and wages, and greatly increased the real wages of workers and staff. At the same time, the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic Government promulgated an order on the issuance of pensions to the working people. Those who lose their ability to work due to accidents at work can receive a pension equal to 42 to 75 percent of their income, and male workers who are 55 years old and female workers who are 50 years old can enjoy the pension.
    The Constitution stipulates that the people have the right to education. In 1950, Hungary implemented eight-year compulsory education, and all school-age children have been enrolled in school. In the 1951-1952 academic year, Hungary had 1.25 million primary school students, 120,000 middle school students, and 46,890 university students. The children of workers and peasants accounted for 68 percent of middle school students and 57 percent of university students, in addition to the children of staff and intellectuals.
    The Constitution guarantees women equal rights with men in political, economic, social, and cultural life. Currently, there are two female members in the Presidium of the Hungarian Government, 71 female members in the National Assembly, and 66,000 female members in the local people's representative conferences at all levels. Many women have become business managers, doctors, and scientists. 533 women have been awarded the Order and Medal of the Hungarian People's Republic, and 20 women have been awarded the highest national award - the Kossuth Prize.
    The Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic is a summary of the brilliant victories that the Hungarian people have already achieved on the road of people's democracy, and it is a powerful guarantee for the Hungarian people to strive for socialist victory. Under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the people's leader Rakosi, the Hungarian people are advancing towards socialism and a bright future with full confidence.

    匈牙利人民的伟大胜利
    ——纪念匈牙利人民共和国宪法颁布三周年
    八月二十日是匈牙利人民共和国宪法颁布三周年纪念日。一九四九年通过的匈牙利人民共和国宪法，是匈牙利人民在争取人民民主、争取社会主义和幸福生活的长期斗争中赢得的胜利成果。它反映了匈牙利在苏联军队的援助下获得解放以后，在国内政治、社会和经济结构各方面发生的根本变化，并确定了匈牙利向社会主义前进的坚定不移的方向。在宪法颁布以来的三年中，匈牙利人民胜利地沿着人民民主的道路继续向社会主义前进。
    一九四五年四月四日，伟大的苏联军队从德国法西斯的奴役下解放了匈牙利，粉碎了匈牙利的大地主和资本家的政权，为匈牙利人民打开了走向社会主义的道路。早在一九四四年十月，匈牙利人民就在共产党的领导下，组织了包括各民主党派的匈牙利民族独立阵线，进行争取民族解放和民主的斗争。同年十二月，在解放了的匈牙利国土上举行选举，选出了临时人民议会，建立了临时政府。解放后，匈牙利人民在匈牙利共产党和人民领袖拉科西的领导下，进行了粉碎外国帝国主义者所支持的反动派的反革命活动和建立并巩固人民民主制度的斗争。一九四五年十一月根据新选举法举行了国民议会选举。新选出的国民议会在一九四六年二月一日宣布废除君主政权，建立匈牙利民主共和国。一九四九年五月举行解放后第三次国民议会选举，百分之九十六点一五的选民都投票拥护民族独立阵线的候选人。同年八月二十日，国民议会执行人民的意志，一致通过匈牙利人民共和国宪法，宣布匈牙利为人民民主共和国，使匈牙利向社会主义前进的立国方针固定下来。
    宪法规定匈牙利人民共和国是工人和劳动农民的国家，一切权力属于劳动人民。国家最高权力机关和各级地方权力机关均由劳动人民根据普遍、平等直接、不记名投票的原则选举产生，对不称职的代表可行使罢免权。一九五○年十月二十二日按照宪法举行的各级地方权力机关的选举中，百分之九十六点九的选民行使了他们的权利，选出了二十二万名代表和候补代表。占投票人数的百分之九十七点八的选民投票拥护人民民主阵线提出的候选人，拥护人民民主制度，拥护领导他们向社会主义前进的匈牙利劳动人民党。
    宪法确定了匈牙利社会和经济结构的新的基础。匈牙利人民共和国的土地、一切自然资源、运输工具、邮政和电讯事业、银行、国营的农业企业，都是国家的财产，即全民财产。宪法承认和保护个人因劳动所得的财产，并保障继承权。一九四九年年底，匈牙利宣布将凡雇用十名以上工人的企业以及外国资本所握有的企业收归国有，完成了工业国有化的工作，为保证国家经济计划的执行创造了决定性的条件。
    宪法确定和保护劳动农民对土地的权利，国家以建立国营农场和农业机器站，以及通过各种方式帮助按照自愿和共同劳动的原则建立农业生产合作社，以促进社会主义农业的发展。在国家的全面援助下，农业中的社会主义部分在去年年底已占全国耕地面积的四分之一；在今年第二季中，国营农场的耕地面积比去年增加了百分之四十一点四，农业生产合作社的耕地面积增加了百分之三十七。
    宪法确定以国民经济计划来指导匈牙利人民共和国的经济生活，以发展生产力、增加国家财富、提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平，并增强国防力量。一九四九年，匈牙利提前完成了恢复和发展国民经济的三年计划，使工业总产量超过战前水平百分之五十三，工业在国民收入中所占的比重，由一九三八年的百分之三十二点八增加到百分之四十九点二。从一九五○年起，匈牙利开始执行促进国家工业化和奠定社会主义基础的五年计划。一九五一年扩大了的五年计划规定，匈牙利工业生产在五年内将增加两倍，重工业将增加到四倍，轻工业将增加一倍半，工农业生产的比例将为八十比二十。生产年年都在增加。一九五○年工业生产超过一九四九年百分之三十五，一九五一年又增加了百分之三十点一，今年第二季比去年同期又增加了百分之二十三点五。
    宪法规定人民享有劳动权、休息权、及在丧失工作能力时得到国家救助的权利。宪法并确定匈牙利人民共和国实行“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的社会主义原则。早在三年计划期间，匈牙利就已经消灭了失业。在五年计划期间，工人数目将增加六十万到六十五万。一九五○年匈牙利职工生活水平已比战前一九三八年提高了百分之八十七。在一九五一年年底，匈牙利又废除了配给制，调整了物价和工资，使职工实际工资大为增加。同时匈牙利人民共和国政府主席团颁布了关于发给劳动人民年金的命令。因为工作中的意外事件丧失工作能力的，可以得到等于他们的收入百分之四十二到七十五的年金，年满五十五岁的男工和年满五十岁的女工都可以享受到年金。
    宪法确定人民有受教育的权利。匈牙利在一九五○年就实行了八年制的强迫教育，全部学龄儿童均已就学。在一九五一年——一九五二年学年中，匈牙利有一百二十五万小学生，十二万中学生，四万六千八百九十名大学生。工农的子女占中学生的百分之六十八，占大学生的百分之五十七，此外就是职员和知识分子的子女。
    宪法保障妇女在政治、经济、社会和文化生活中享有和男子同等的权利。现在，匈牙利政府主席团中有两个女委员，国民议会有七十一个女议员，各级地方人民代表会议有六万六千个女议员。许多妇女已成为企业经理、医生和科学家。五百三十三位妇女已荣获匈牙利人民共和国的勋章和奖章，二十位妇女荣膺国家最高勋奖——科苏斯奖金。
    匈牙利人民共和国宪法是匈牙利人民在人民民主道路上已经获得的光辉胜利的总结，是匈牙利人民争取社会主义胜利的有力保证。在匈牙利劳动人民党和人民领袖拉科西的领导下，匈牙利人民正满怀信心地向社会主义和美好将来前进。    （新华社）
