    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 3rd -- The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continue to strike at the invading enemy forces. On July 26th, an enemy battalion on the eastern front, under the cover of artillery fire, violently attacked the Bianyandong area, about ten kilometers northwest of Wendengli, and was repelled by our army after more than twenty consecutive assaults, with over two hundred enemy casualties. On the same day, on the western front, a vanguard unit of our army suddenly attacked an enemy position northwest of Lianchuan and quickly occupied the enemy's position. Subsequently, the enemy counterattacked the area with two platoons but were repelled by our army, with over eighty enemy casualties. From late night on the 27th to the morning of the 28th, our army repelled two enemy advances in the Yandong area west of Wendengli, killing and wounding thirty-nine enemy soldiers. On the 28th, a unit of our army launched a surprise attack on the enemy position at Gaoyangdaixi Mountain northwest of Lianchuan, killing and wounding fifty-five American invading soldiers entrenched there. On the 29th, the enemy launched four counterattacks against the area with forces ranging from one platoon to two companies, all of which were repelled by our army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 1st -- Our frontline reporter reports: Recently, the American Air Force invading Korea, under the instruction of the Pentagon's so-called "strengthening of air pressure," has been more active on the front lines. As a result of this increased activity, the battle achievements of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces in anti-air operations have increased sharply. According to statistics for the first half of July: Enemy aircraft were active over the front line, a stretch of about forty *li* wide, east of the Imjin River and west of Tieyuan, reaching 1,343 sorties, more than three times the number of enemy aircraft active in the area in April. In half a month, a unit of our army guarding this area damaged or destroyed 40 enemy aircraft with various anti-aircraft firearms, including 14 shot down and 26 damaged. The achievements of this half-month are equivalent to five times that of the area in April, slightly less than that of May, and exceed the 33 from June. The frantic activity of enemy aircraft is directly proportional to their loss rate, and the anti-aircraft gunners of the Korean and Chinese people are confidently striving to create greater victories.

    朝中人民部队继续打击进犯的敌军
    七月上半月铁原以西我对空作战中毁伤敌机四十架
    【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军继续打击进犯的敌军。七月二十六日，东线敌军一个营在炮火掩护下猛犯文登里西北约十公里的边岩洞地区，连续二十多次冲锋都被我军击退，敌军伤亡二百多名。同日，西线我军某部一支前哨部队突袭涟川西北某处的敌军阵地，迅速占领了敌人的阵地。接着，敌军以两个排向该地反扑，被我军击退，敌军伤亡八十多名。二十七日深夜至二十八日晨，我军在文登里以西岩洞附近地区击退敌军两次进犯，毙伤敌军三十九名。二十八日，我军某部突袭涟川西北高阳岱西山敌军阵地，盘踞该地的美国侵略军被毙伤五十五名。二十九日，敌军又以一个排至两个连的兵力向该地反扑四次都被我军击退。
    【新华社朝鲜前线一日电】本社前线记者报道：最近侵朝美国空军在五角大楼所谓“加强空军压力”的指令下，在前线活动更加频繁。这一频繁活动的结果，使朝中人民部队对空作战的战绩激增。据七月份上半月的统计：敌机在临津江以东，铁原以西约四十华里宽的战线上空活动达一千三百四十三架次，相当于四月份敌机在该地区活动架次的三倍强。守卫在这里的我军某部在半月内就以各种对空射击火器毁伤敌机四十架，其中击落十四架，击伤二十六架。这半个月的战绩相当于四月份该地区的五倍，相当于五月份的不足一倍，超过六月份的三十三架。敌机的疯狂活动和其损失率适成正比，朝中人民对空射击手们正满怀信心地争取创造更大的胜利。
