Among the thousands of athletes active in the "August 1st" Sports Meet, many are senior and middle-ranking cadres with extensive combat experience and remarkable achievements; they are athletes from the Military Academy. The tug-of-war team alone has six veterans of the Red Army with over twenty years of service. There are also combat heroes and model workers. During the long years of the Liberation War, they shed blood for the cause of the people's revolution and spent their youth in arduous struggles. Now in their thirties and forties, they have come to the capital to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the great founding of the army, joyfully participating in the sports meet and competing in various events with the vigorous young athletes.

These veteran athletes are all enthusiasts and organizers of sports in the military. Some participated in sports meets held by the Red Army during the Long March, and others participated in various sports meets in northern Shaanxi. During the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, they were active participants or organizers of sports meets in various regions. Today, seeing such a grand and unprecedented "August 1st" Sports Meet, they cannot help but recall the past.

In the years of war, the military's sports activities served more directly to improve combat effectiveness. At that time, sports became an important part of military training, a regular, combat-oriented, and widely popular activity. Du Wanrong, former Director of the Political Department of the Mianyang Military Sub-district in western Sichuan, who participated in the tug-of-war competition at the "August 1st" Sports Meet, recalled the sports activities during the Red Army era. At that time, in addition to marching and camping out, there were more than ten sports activities such as grenade throwing, bayonet drills, boxing, saber practice, crossing sky bridges, jumping over wooden horses, climbing obstacles, forming human ladders, riding horses, and swimming. Du Wanrong was a grenade thrower and shooter at the time, and his grenade throwing results reached over seventy meters. In addition, he was a mountain climbing enthusiast. When he was a company commander, he often trained his soldiers to run and climb mountains. In the mountainous areas of the south, there were no playgrounds, so he led his soldiers to run everywhere on the winding field ridges. Every morning, he also led fully armed soldiers to climb hilltops. Regiment Commander Lai Sheng Rong, also an athlete participating in the tug-of-war competition, stayed in western Fujian after the main force of the Red Army embarked on the Long March, persisting in guerrilla warfare. The mountainous areas of western Fujian are characterized by high mountains, steep ridges, dense bamboo forests, and many multi-story buildings. Counter-revolutionary armed forces – local militias – mostly lived upstairs. At that time, Red Army guerrillas often climbed up tall buildings to seize weapons from the militias and punish counter-revolutionaries who were hated by the masses. Sometimes, Red Army guerrillas were surrounded by the enemy in the woods, and the soldiers would climb up tall trees to shoot at the enemy without waiting for them to get close. The Red Army guerrillas were very agile and skillful in climbing tall buildings and big trees because they regularly practiced climbing in the bamboo forests. Regiment Commander Lai Sheng Rong was also a climbing expert in those years.

At that time, the brave soldiers possessed a strong revolutionary will and consciously trained their physical strength, preparing to defeat the enemy. Without sports equipment, the soldiers took the initiative to overcome difficulties, using hillsides as breastworks and felling large trees in the forest to make single-plank bridges; they borrowed peasants' hoe handles or wooden forks to make horizontal bars. When they had no other options, they would wrestle, throw stones, and climb walls. The soldiers climbed mountains when they were near mountains, swam when they were near rivers, and rode horses on the plains. Among them were swimming masters who crossed the Yan River in northern Shaanxi, and some who are still outstanding riders today. Shen Chun Guang, Director of the Political Department of the division, and a football player, liked to play ball. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the troops captured an enemy stronghold in Shandong, they obtained a basketball. Shen Chun Guang regarded it as a treasure, carrying it everywhere. When the basketball was damaged, he mended it again and again, reluctant to discard it. During frequent marches and battles, it was impossible to set up a basketball hoop, so he and his soldiers used wire to tie a hoop to a tree and shoot into it. In this way, Shen Chun Guang became an excellent ball player.

The leaders at all levels of the troops were not only organizers and motivators of sports activities, but were often active participants themselves. Du Wanrong still clearly remembers that during a sports meet held by the Red Army University and the directly subordinate units of the Central Column in Luding, western Sichuan, during the Long March, Commander-in-Chief Zhu participated and competed with them in ball games. At that time, the youth team in the troops was called the "Zhu De Youth Team," because Commander-in-Chief Zhu was always the most active athlete. Du Bo Ying and Ma Xiao Xian, who came to participate in the "August 1st" Sports Meet this time, were both members of the "Zhu De Youth Team."

Regular and rigorous physical training, cultivating the soldiers' strong physique and brave, fearless, and resolute spirit, became an important part of the invincible combat power of the people's army. Zhang Ye Guang, Deputy Regiment Commander of the football team, offered an example that fully illustrates this point. In 1941, in Xujialiugou, Juxian County, Shandong Province, the troops were surrounded by the enemy on five sides. The enemy had already completed the encirclement. The Japanese invaders estimated that our army would not be able to reach the Rizhao-Juxian Highway, seventy or eighty *li* away from Xujialiugou, until dawn at the earliest, so they planned to intercept us there. However, the Eighth Route Army soldiers, who had been trained, marched 140 *li* in a forced night march, crossed the highway in the middle of the night, and successfully broke through to the Wulian Mountain area, thwarting the enemy's vicious plan. During the Liberation War, Zhang Ye Guang led his troops to pursue the enemy three times south of the Yangtze River in Northeast China. They only ate one meal a day, pursued for 130 *li*, and one company annihilated an enemy battalion. Shi Zhen Hua, the basketball team member and regimental chief of staff, led soldiers to jump into the outer moat during the battle to attack Changzi City in the Shangdang Campaign, skillfully forming a human ladder to climb the city wall and bravely repulsed thirteen enemy counterattacks. After being wounded during the seventh counterattack, he was still able to persevere until the end of the battle, winning the glorious title of combat hero and receiving the lofty commendation of having his photograph taken under the red flag. These veteran soldiers, who have undergone rigorous training, still have strong physiques and are full of energy.

The veteran athletes demonstrated a brave, tenacious fighting spirit and excellent qualities such as discipline, friendliness, modesty, and close collaboration on the playing field of the "August 1st" Sports Meet. On the playing field and in the campgrounds, all their exemplary actions won the universal respect and praise of the young athletes, encouraging them to advance bravely.

These excellent athletes with extensive combat experience and remarkable achievements will lead thousands upon thousands of soldiers to advance on the glorious road of building a modernized national defense force. Today, they have come to the capital and personally participated in the grand sports meet, seeing the prosperity of the motherland and the heroic spirit of the younger generation, and feel boundless excitement and joy. Huang Chuanlong, Chief of Staff of a certain army who joined the Red Army in 1933, said: "Mao Zedong's soldiers are forever young and strong. We must teach the soldiers to always remember Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions: Train ourselves to become men of iron physique, to defend our most beloved country. We must advance with the youth towards new victories!"

    永远年轻健壮
    ——记军事学院运动员
    新华社记者  谢丁
    活跃在“八一”体育运动大会运动场上的数千健儿中，有许多是身经百战、功勋卓著的高级和中级干部，他们是军事学院的运动员。光一个拔河队就有六个是二十多年的老红军，另外有战斗英雄，也有模范工作者。在长期的解放战争年代里，他们为人民革命事业洒流过鲜血，在艰辛的斗争中度过自己的青春，现在都是三、四十岁年纪了。在庆祝伟大建军节二十五周年的时候，他们来到首都，兴高采烈地参加了体育运动大会，和生龙活虎般的青年运动员们在运动场上展开各项竞赛。
    这些老运动员都是部队中体育运动的爱好者和组织者，有的参加过红军在长征路上举行的运动会，有的参加过陕北的各次运动会。在抗日战争和解放战争时期，他们都是各个地区运动会的积极参加者或组织者。今天当他们见到这样隆重和空前盛大的“八一”体育运动大会，都不禁想起以往的情形。
    在战争的年代中，部队的体育运动是更直接地为提高战斗力而服务的。当时体育运动成为军事训练的重要部分，是经常的、战斗的和广泛群众性的活动。参加“八一”体育运动大会拔河比赛的原川西绵阳军分区政治部主任杜万荣，回忆了红军时代的体育活动，那时除了行军和打野外等锻炼之外，还有投弹、刺杀、拳术、劈刀、过天桥、跳木马、爬障碍、接人梯、骑马、游泳等十多种体育活动。当时杜万荣是投弹和射击的选手，投弹的成绩曾达到七十公尺以上。此外，他是爬山的爱好者，他当连长的时候，经常训练他的战士跑步、爬山。在南方的山区里没有操场，他率领战士们在弯曲的田坎里到处跑；每天早晨，他还率领着全副武装战士爬山头。赖胜荣团长也是参加拔河比赛的运动员，他是在红军主力长征后留在闽西坚持游击战争的。闽西地区高山峻岭，竹林茂密，多楼房。反革命武装——地方民团多住在楼上。当时红军游击队常常攀上高楼去缴民团的枪枝，惩治为群众痛恨的反革命分子。有时红军游击队被敌人包围在树林里了，战士们不等到敌人靠近便攀上大树射击敌人。红军游击队的战士们攀登高楼和大树非常敏捷灵巧，因为他们经常地在竹林里做爬高的锻炼。赖胜荣团长当年也是爬高的能手。
    当时英勇的战士们具有坚强的革命意志，都自觉地要锻炼自己的体力，准备去战胜敌人。没有体育的器械，战士们就自己动手克服困难，利用山坡作胸墙，到森林里砍伐大木来做独木桥；借用老百姓的锨柄或木叉来做单杠。他们在没有办法时就进行摔跤角力、掷石头、爬墙头等活动。战士们靠山就爬山，近河就游泳，在平原上就跑马。他们之中，有当年在陕北横渡延河的游泳健将，有的甚至直到现在还是出色的骑手。足球队员师政治部主任沈春光喜欢打球。抗日战争时期，部队在山东攻下敌人据点时得到一个篮球，沈春光便把它看做宝贝一样，到处背着走，篮球坏了补了又补，舍不得丢弃。在频繁的行军作战中，立不起球架子，他和战士们用铁丝扎一个框子绑在树上投空篮。就这样，沈春光练成为一个出色的球手。
    部队的各级首长不但是体育运动的组织者和鼓舞者，而且往往都是积极的参加者。杜万荣至今还清楚地记得，在红军长征到西康泸河时，红军大学和中央纵队直属队所举行的一次运动会上，朱总司令参加和他们赛球的情形。那时部队中的青年队就叫做“朱德青年队”，因为朱总司令当时总是最活跃的运动员。这次来参加“八一”体育运动会的杜伯英、马小先都曾是“朱德青年队”的队员。
    经常进行严格的体育锻炼，养成战士的坚强体质和勇敢无畏、坚毅的精神，成为人民军队无敌战斗力的重要部分。足球队长张野光副团长随便举出的一个例子就充分地说明了这点。一九四一年在山东莒县徐家柳沟，部队遭到敌人五路围攻。当时敌人已经合围了。日寇估计我军最快也要在拂晓时才能到达离徐家柳沟七八十里的日（照）莒（县）公路，所以他们准备在那里截击。但素有锻炼的八路军战士，一夜急行军一百四十里，在半夜时便穿过这条公路，向五莲山区胜利突围，粉碎了敌人的恶毒计划。在解放战争中，张野光在东北三下江南时率领部队追击敌军，一天只吃一顿饭，追出一百三十里，一个连消灭了敌人一个营。篮球队员、团参谋长师振华在上党战役攻击长子城战斗中，率领战士跳入外壕，熟练地搭成人梯攀上城头，奋勇打退了敌人十三次反冲锋。他在第七次反击时负伤后，仍能坚持到战斗胜利结束，赢得战斗英雄的光荣称号，获得在红旗下照像的崇高嘉奖。这些经过严格锻炼的老战士至今一直具有坚强的体魄，精力十分充沛。
    老运动员们在“八一”体育运动大会的运动场上表现了勇敢、坚毅的战斗精神以及遵守纪律、友爱谦虚、紧密协同等等的优良作风。在运动场上、在宿营地里，他们所有这些模范的行动，赢得青年运动员们普遍的尊敬和赞扬，鼓舞着青年运动员们勇敢前进。
    这些身经百战、功勋卓著的优秀的运动员们，将率领成千成万的战士向建设现代化国防军的光荣道路上迈进。今天，他们来到首都，并亲自参加了盛大的体育运动大会，看到祖国的兴旺气象和青年一代的英雄气概，都感到无限的兴奋和喜悦。一九三三年参加红军的某军参谋处长黄传龙说：“毛泽东的战士是永远年轻而健壮的，我们要教导战士们永远牢记朱总司令的指示：锻炼自己成为铁的体质，保卫我们最可爱的国家。我们要和青年们一道向新的胜利前进！”
