Short Commentary

    From the progress of the People's Representative Conference work in many regions, we can see the trends in the construction of democratic power in various places. One issue is particularly worth everyone's attention, and that is how to form the People's Representative Conference into a regular and consolidated system.

    It has been a year and six months since Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi instructed us that the system of People's Representative Conferences should become a systematic, regular, and consolidated system from top to bottom in our country. Most regions have followed Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's instructions, but there are still some regions where this system has not been able to achieve a regular and consolidated state. Why is this? What methods can be used to improve it? Some cadres believe that there is a contradiction between the central work and the work of the People's Representative Conference. Is this true? Obviously not. The central work and the People's Representative Conference are not two different or opposing types of work. The central work is the main task that the people currently need to handle; the People's Representative Conference is the system by which the people exercise their power to handle these tasks. Using this superior system of people's democracy to concentrate the will of the people and organize the people to carry out the central work can make the central work even better. Where is the contradiction in this? The reason why these cadres feel a contradiction is that when carrying out the central tasks, they are not good at convening the People's Representative Conference, but simply arrange things through cadre meetings in order to complete the tasks quickly. But since they have not convened the People's Representative Conference, they cannot see the great effectiveness of the People's Representative Conference in completing the task perfectly.

    Now, some regions have stipulated methods to ensure that the People's Representative Conference can be formed into a regular system. This method is: to instruct the higher-level people's government to arrange both the central work and the work of convening the People's Representative Conference at the same time. Taking the county as an example, it is stipulated that the county People's Representative Conference must be held once in the spring, with the implementation of the annual production task as the central topic; and once in the autumn, with the summary of the annual production, the promotion of material exchange, and the implementation of winter work as the central topics. The time for these two meetings must be fixed before spring plowing and after autumn harvest. A meeting should also be held in the summer, but because the situation varies from place to place, the time may not be fixed. If there are urgent tasks, a temporary People's Representative Conference can also be convened. The benefits of this unified arrangement closely combined with production are obvious. Because the most important work of the county is generally to organize agricultural production, strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and decide on various major measures to ensure production. Stipulating that the People's Representative Conference discuss these tasks at the most appropriate time will be approved by cadres and representatives, and the masses will definitely support it. Everyone will experience from practice that the People's Representative Conference not only has no contradiction with the central work, but can also better complete it. Over time, the People's Representative Conference will naturally be formed into a regular and consolidated system.

    Unified arrangements must revolve around a key issue, that is, the People's Representative Conference should focus on discussing production as the main content in the future. Because large-scale economic construction is about to begin, the most important affairs of the country and the people are to organize production. According to the results of the practice in most areas in the first half of this year, the People's Representative Conference, which focuses on production, is the best central place to promote production. It can eliminate the people's various ideological concerns about production and unify the people's ideological understanding; it can revise the government's production plan to make it more practical; it can give play to the enthusiasm of the people and representatives and come up with methods that cannot be conceived by a few cadres; and after the meeting, due to the exemplary role and active promotion of the representatives, it can quickly set off a high tide of mass production and overfulfill the task. This spring, farmers in various places had conservative ideas such as "fear of standing out" and "production reaching the top," which were overcome through discussions at the People's Representative Conference. The original plan of Pingyuan Province was to dig 20,000 wells, which was increased to 42,000 wells after discussions at the People's Representative Conference in various counties. The original plan of Xin County, Shanxi Province, was to build 82 small canals, which was increased to 209 after discussions at the People's Representative Conference. After discussing spring plowing at the People's Representative Conference, Chenliu County, Henan Province, immediately organized 2,127 mutual aid teams, and the amount of fertilizer applied increased by 20% to 40%. These all demonstrate the great effect of the People's Representative Conference in launching the patriotic production increase movement.

    In the future, the unified arrangement, ideological education, and supervision and inspection of the work of the People's Representative Conference should be closely combined with various central tasks, especially with production work. Not only should we arrange meetings, but also arrange what central work should be the main topic of discussion; not only should we check whether the meeting has been held, but also check what role the meeting has played in production. Only in this way can we give full play to the superiority of the people's democratic power system in the large-scale production movement in the future.

### 怎样使人民代表会议形成为经常巩固的制度

    怎样使人民代表会议形成为经常巩固的制度
    从许多地区推进人民代表会议工作的情况中，我们可以看出各地民主政权建设工作的动向，其中有一个问题特别值得大家注意，这就是怎样使人民代表会议形成为经常巩固的制度。
    自从刘少奇副主席指示我们应使人民代表会议的制度成为我们国家从上至下的系统的经常的巩固的制度以来，已经一年零六个月了，大部地区已遵照刘少奇副主席的指示办事，但还有一部分地区，这种制度并未能达到经常巩固的程度。这是为什么？有什么办法可以改进？有些干部认为中心工作和人民代表会议的工作发生矛盾，这是不是事实呢？显然不是。中心工作和人民代表会议并不是什么不同的或对立的两种工作。中心工作，是人民群众当前所要办理的主要事务；人民代表会议，就是人民行使自己的权力去办理这些事务的制度。以这种优越的人民民主制度来集中人民的意志，并组织人民群众去进行中心工作，就可使中心工作做得更好。试问这有什么矛盾呢？这些干部之所以感到矛盾，就是因为他们在执行中心任务的时候，不善于召开人民代表会议，而只是通过干部会议布置下去，以求迅速完成任务。但他们既然没有召开人民代表会议，就看不见人民代表会议能把任务完成得尽善尽美的伟大功效。
    现在，有些地区已规定了办法，使人民代表会议有保证能够形成为经常的制度。这个办法就是：责成上级人民政府，将中心工作和召开人民代表会议的工作，同时布置下去。以县为例，规定县人民代表会议春季必开一次，以贯彻全年生产任务为中心议题；秋季必开一次，以总结全年生产、推动物资交流、贯彻冬季工作为中心议题。这两次会议的时间必须固定于春耕前和秋收后。到了夏季也应召开一次，但因各地情况不同，时间可不固定，如有紧急任务，还可召开临时人民代表会议。这种密切结合生产的统一布置，它的好处是显而易见的。因为县的最主要工作，一般是组织农业生产，加强城乡物资交流和决定保障生产工作的各项重大措施。规定人民代表会议在最恰当的时候讨论这些工作，则干部和代表都将赞成，群众一定拥护。大家从实际中体验到人民代表会议不但和中心工作没有矛盾，而且能够更好地完成它，这样久而久之，人民代表会议就自然形成为经常巩固的制度了。
    统一布置必须围绕着一个关键问题，就是人民代表会议今后应以讨论生产为主要内容。因为今后大规模的经济建设即将开展，国家和人民的最重要的事务，就是组织生产，而以生产为中心内容的人民代表会议，根据今年上半年大部地区实践的结果，正是推动生产的最好的中心场所，它能够解除人民对生产的各种思想顾虑，统一人民的思想认识；能够修正政府对生产的计划，而使之切合实际；能够发挥人民和代表的积极性，想出非少数干部所能想得出来的办法；而在会后由于代表的模范作用和积极推动，能够迅速掀起群众生产的高潮，超计划地完成任务。如今春各地农民有“怕冒尖”、“生产到顶”等保守思想，都是经过人民代表会议的讨论，而加以克服的。平原省原计划打井二万眼，经各县人民代表会议讨论，增加为四万二千眼。山西省忻县原计划修小型水渠八十二道，经过人民代表会议讨论，增加为二百零九道。河南省陈留县在人民代表会议上讨论了春耕以后，立即组织了互助组二一二七个，施肥量增加了二成到四成。这些都说明人民代表会议对展开爱国增产运动的伟大功效。
    今后对人民代表会议工作的统一布置、思想教育与督促检查，都应该密切结合各种中心工作、特别是结合生产工作去进行。不但要布置开会，而且要布置以讨论什么中心工作为主要议题；不但要检查会议开了没有，而且要检查会议对生产起了什么作用。只有这样，才能在今后大规模生产运动中，充分发挥人民民主政权制度的优越性。
