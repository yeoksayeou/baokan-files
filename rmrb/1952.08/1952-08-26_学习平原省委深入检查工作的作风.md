A Brief Commentary on Party Life

    Learning from the Plain Province Party Committee's Style of In-depth Work Inspection
    On the foundation of the victories of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the responsible comrades of the CCP Plain Province Committee leading a large number of cadres to go down to factories and villages for in-depth work inspection is of great significance. This is an effective measure to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" campaign, establish a work style of connecting with the masses, and promote the advancement of industrial and agricultural production.
    Since entering the cities, many Party leading organs have not been able to guarantee the Party's leadership over economic construction well due to the existence of bureaucratic work styles detached from reality and the masses. This error has been cleared up in the "Three-Anti" movement; however, we should not think that inspecting bureaucracy is already "all done." The thorough overcoming of bureaucracy is still a long-term struggle process. We must continue to implement the spirit of opposing bureaucracy in various practical works and earnestly establish a new work style. It is undoubtedly of great significance that the responsible comrades of the Plain Province Party Committee personally lead cadres to go down to factories and villages to inspect work.
    The patriotic production increase and economy campaign currently being carried out across the country urgently requires the Party committee to strengthen ideological and political leadership. And one of the fundamental methods for the Party committee to lead the patriotic production increase and economy campaign is to conduct in-depth work inspections. Stalin once pointed out: "Well-organized inspection of implementation work is like a searchlight, which can help to find out the working condition of various organs at any time and expose bureaucrats and formalists at any time." ("Questions of Leninism," p. 639) Therefore, as long as we truly adopt a humble attitude of learning, go deep into workshops, investigate and study, and repeatedly think, we will definitely be able to understand the main situation, main experience, and main problems existing in the current patriotic production increase and economy campaign in the province, and thereby make a summary, put forward guiding opinions on the work, and ensure the smooth development of the campaign.
    It is very likely that some leaders will say: "If the head of the organization has to do everything personally, how can we manage to get everything done!" People who say these things may be very busy, but these people really don't know what they are busy with. If they say they are busy for work, they do not know the actual working conditions below; if they say they are busy for the masses, they do not know what requirements and opinions the masses have. These people are just busy with trivial matters, and their work efficiency and work time are very disproportionate. Some of them may not understand that after the principles are determined and the work is arranged, one of the decisive links to ensure the correct implementation of the principles is to correctly check the implementation of the work. The so-called checking work is not just to find the shortcomings and errors of the lower-level leading organs, but mainly to give them practical help and guide them to do their work well. Because some people do not understand that checking work has such a profound significance, they have adopted a negative attitude towards checking work; or they entrust the checking work to minor staff members. This is not allowed.
    The practice of the Plain Province Party Committee is correct. This practice should be paid attention to by the Party leading organs in various places. Only by adopting such a leadership method can we gradually eliminate the bureaucratic work style within the Party and establish a new work style that connects with reality and the masses.

### 学习平原省委深入检查工作的作风

    学习平原省委深入检查工作的作风
    在“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上，中共平原省委各负责同志率领大批干部下厂下乡深入检查工作，是有重大意义的。这是巩固“三反”成果，树立联系群众的工作作风，推动工农业生产前进的有效措施。
    进城以来，有不少党的领导机关，由于存在着脱离实际脱离群众的官僚主义作风，以致没有很好地保证党对经济建设的领导。这种错误已在“三反”运动中作了清算；但是我们不要以为检查了官僚主义就已经“万事大吉”，官僚主义的彻底克服还是一个长期的斗争过程。我们必须在各种实际工作中继续贯彻反对官僚主义的精神，认真建立新的工作作风。平原省委负责同志亲自率领干部下厂下乡检查工作，无疑是有着很大意义的。
    目前正在全国开展着的爱国增产节约运动，迫切需要党委加强思想政治领导。而党委领导爱国增产节约运动的根本方法之一，就是进行深入的工作检查。斯大林曾指出：“组织得完善的审查执行情况的工作，好似探照灯一样，能帮助随时查明各个机关底工作状况，随时揭破官僚主义者与形式主义者。”（“列宁主义问题”六三九页）因此，只要真正采取虚心学习的态度，深入车间，调查研究，反复思考，那么就一定能够了解到目前全省爱国增产节约运动的主要情况、主要经验、存在的主要问题，并由此作出总结，对工作提出指导性的意见，保证运动的顺利开展。
    很可能有些领导人会这样说：“什么都要首长亲自动手，那怎么忙得过来呢！”说这些话的人可能很忙，但这些人也确实不知道为了什么忙。说他们是为了工作，他们却不知道下边的实际工作情况；说他们是为了群众，他们又不知道群众有些什么要求和意见。这些人只是为琐碎的事务而忙碌不休，他们的工作效率和工作时间是很不相称的。其中有些可能是不懂得：在方针确定，工作布置下去后，保证方针正确贯彻的决定环节之一，就是正确地检查工作的执行情况。所谓检查工作，并不是专去找下级领导机关的缺点和错误，主要的还是为了给他们以实际的帮助，指导他们作好工作。因为有些人不了解检查工作有这样深刻的意义，所以对检查工作采取了消极的态度；或者把检查工作交给次要的工作人员去作。这是不容许的。
    平原省委的作法是正确的。这种作法应该为各地党的领导机关所注意。只有采取这样的领导方法，才能逐步肃清党内的官僚主义作风，树立起联系实际联系群众的新的工作作风。
