On the basis of the unprecedentedly high patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, Chahar Province has universally launched a campaign this year to guarantee high yields on the land of families of martyrs and military personnel. Since the main links for increasing yield per unit area, in addition to intensive cultivation and water conservancy construction, must also solve the problem of poverty-stricken families of martyrs and military personnel lacking fertilizer or having a shortage of fertilizer, Chahar Province specifically put forward the slogan "Ensure that the amount of fertilizer applied to the land of families of martyrs and military personnel is not lower than that of the masses." Last summer, the province widely launched a campaign to press green manure for families of martyrs and military personnel; this spring, a mass fertilizer donation campaign was launched; governments at all levels also systematically used preferential grain for military families to purchase fertilizer for families of martyrs and military personnel, and helped families of martyrs and military personnel raise sheep and feed pigs; cooperatives also gave priority to lending fertilizer to families of martyrs and military personnel when lending fertilizer. As a result, the amount of fertilizer applied to the land of most families of martyrs and military personnel in the province this year is no lower than that of the general masses, and the land of individual areas and individual households has even exceeded that of the general masses. According to statistics from five counties in northern Chahar, the area of ​​land fertilized by families of martyrs and military personnel exceeded that of the masses by 30%, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu exceeded that of the masses by 0.3 cartloads; in Chicheng County in southern Chahar, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land for families of martyrs and military personnel exceeded that of the masses by 1.5 cartloads; in Longguan County, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land for families of martyrs and military personnel exceeded that of the masses by two pack loads; according to statistics from 23 villages in the fifth district of Zhuolu County, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land for families of martyrs and military personnel exceeded that of the masses by three pack loads; in Yanggao County in northern Yanbei, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land for families of martyrs and military personnel exceeded that of the masses by one cartload.

The methods used in various parts of the province to solve the fertilizer problem for families of martyrs and military personnel are as follows:

(1) Launching a mass fertilizer donation campaign is the main method to ensure that the amount of fertilizer applied to the land of families of martyrs and military personnel is not lower than that of the masses. As a result of this campaign, according to statistics from only 12 counties, the fertilizer donated by the masses to families of martyrs and military personnel reached 422,930 cartloads, solving the fertilizer problem for 83,586 mu of land. The masses believe that donating fertilizer is one of their practical actions to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Su Zhanhai, a 12-year-old child in Yulintun, Huailai County, said: "I will donate three pack loads. I will play less after school and complete the three pack loads of manure." The women's director of the village said: "We women guarantee to donate 100 pack loads to show the strength of our women in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea." In less than three hours, the village donated 921 pack loads of fertilizer.

(2) Actively helping families of martyrs and military personnel raise sheep and feed pigs is also a good way to solve the problem of families of martyrs and military personnel lacking fertilizer or having a shortage of fertilizer. In 1951, Chicheng County in southern Chahar used 50,000 jin of preferential grain for military families to buy 700 piglets, and Longguan County used 40,000 jin of preferential grain for military families to buy 445 piglets and 25 sheep, which were distributed to poor families of martyrs and military personnel to help them develop sideline production and solve their fertilizer shortage problem. In addition, various places mobilized the masses to help families of martyrs and military personnel build pigsties.

(3) Last summer, the masses in various places universally launched a campaign to press green manure for families of martyrs and military personnel. Last summer, Chicheng County in southern Chahar pressed 5,108 cartloads of green manure for families of martyrs and military personnel, and each mu of cultivated land could get an average of 4 cartloads. Xihongmiao Village in Wanquan County pressed 1,600 pack loads of fertilizer for families of martyrs and military personnel. Therefore, topdressing fertilizer was applied to the land of families of martyrs and military personnel this year. However, this work was not done well in individual places. For example, Yulintun in Huailai County only sought quantity and not quality when pressing green manure for families of martyrs and military personnel. This is not right.

(4) Southern Chahar advocated building public toilets in every village to help families of martyrs and military personnel accumulate fertilizer; it also stipulated that the excrement of organs and schools should belong to families of martyrs and military personnel, and designated special personnel to be responsible for digging and padding the toilets, accumulating fertilizer, and distributing it to families of martyrs and military personnel for use according to the season. Chicheng County has now established 508 toilets. The excrement of organs and schools in the county has also been distributed to families of martyrs and military personnel. However, the Huailai County government exchanged the excrement that should have been distributed to families of martyrs and military personnel for vegetables. This is not right. The province plans to universally promote the practice of southern Chahar in the future, and proposes that every family of martyrs and military personnel in northern Chahar should be guaranteed to build a toilet.

(5) In addition to emphasizing that supply and marketing cooperatives should give priority to lending fertilizer to families of martyrs and military personnel when lending fertilizer, various counties also used preferential grain for military families to purchase fertilizer for families of martyrs and military personnel. According to statistics, the Chahar Southern Special Zone bought a total of 300,000 jin of dried manure, Huai'an County bought 17,517 jin of sesame cake, and Chicheng bought 40,000 jin of fertilizer. All were distributed to families of martyrs and military personnel who lacked fertilizer.

Thanks to the active help of the government and the masses, the fertilizer problem of families of martyrs and military personnel in the province has been basically solved. Families of martyrs and military personnel have responded well. For example, Cheng, a 70-year-old family member of a military personnel in Huailai County, said after receiving the fertilizer: "I will write a letter today to tell my son about the care the villagers have given me, so that he doesn't have to worry about me and fight the American devils well at the front!"

Although Chahar Province has solved the problem of fertilizer shortage for families of martyrs and military personnel this year by various methods, the amount of fertilizer applied to the land of individual villages and individual families of martyrs and military personnel has not reached the general level. For example, in Haierwa Village, Fifth District of Xuanhua, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land for the masses is five pack loads, while the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land for families of martyrs and military personnel is three pack loads. In order to correct this undesirable phenomenon, the village is now trying to apply topdressing fertilizer to the land of families of martyrs and military personnel.

In order to completely solve the fertilizer problem for families of martyrs and military personnel, in addition to planning to continue to adopt the above methods, the province also plans to use all the old revolutionary base area relief funds allocated by the central government to purchase sheep and distribute them to poor families of martyrs and military personnel in the old and semi-old revolutionary base areas. This will not only develop sideline production, but also help families of martyrs and military personnel accumulate fertilizer.

    察哈尔省这样解决了烈属、军属的土地施肥问题
    察哈尔省人民政府民政厅
    在群众爱国热情空前高涨的基础上，今年察哈尔省普遍开展了保证烈、军属土地丰产的运动。由于提高单位面积产量的主要环节，除精耕细作和兴修水利外，还必须解决贫苦烈、军属无肥缺肥的问题，所以察哈尔省具体提出了“保证烈、军属土地施肥量不得低于群众”的口号。去年夏季，该省各地便普遍开展了给烈、军属压绿肥的运动；今春又开展了群众性的献肥运动；各级政府并有计划地用优军粮给烈、军属购买肥料，帮助烈、军属养羊喂猪；合作社在贷放肥料时，也优先贷给烈、军属。这样就使得今年该省大多数烈、军属土地的施肥量已不低于一般群众，个别地区和个别户的土地还超过了一般群众。据察北五个县统计，烈、军属土地施肥面积超过群众的百分之三十，每亩地施肥量超过群众的零点三车；察南赤城县烈、军属的土地，每亩施肥量超过群众的一车半，龙关县烈、军属的土地，每亩施肥量超过群众的二驮，涿鹿县五区二十三个村统计，烈、军属的土地每亩施肥量超过群众的三驮；雁北阳高县烈、军属的土地，每亩施肥量超过群众的一车。
    该省各地为烈、军属解决肥料问题的方法有以下几种：
    （一）开展群众性的献肥运动，是保证烈、军属土地施肥量不低于群众的主要方法。这一运动开展的结果，仅据十二个县的统计，群众献给烈、军属的肥料即达四十二万二千九百三十车，解决了八万三千五百八十六亩土地的肥料问题。群众都认为捐献肥料是自己抗美援朝的实际行动之一。怀来县榆林屯十二岁的儿童苏占海说：“我献三驮。下学后少玩一会，就把三驮粪完成了。”该屯妇女主任说：
    “我们妇女保证献一百驮，也显示我们妇女抗美援朝的力量。”该屯不到三个小时内，便献出肥料九百二十一驮。
    （二）积极帮助烈、军属养羊、喂猪，也是解决烈、军属无肥缺肥问题的好办法。察南赤城县一九五一年用优军粮五万斤买小猪七百只，龙关县用优军粮四万斤买小猪四百四十五只、羊二十五只，发给了贫苦烈、军属，帮助他们开展副业生产，解决了他们的缺肥问题。此外，各地并发动群众帮助烈、军属盖了猪圈。
    （三）去年夏季各地群众普遍开展了给烈、军属压绿肥的运动。察南赤城县去年夏季给烈、军属压绿肥五千一百零八车，代耕地每亩平均可得四车。万全县西红庙一村，即给烈、军属压肥一千六百驮。因此今年给烈、军属的土地施了追肥。但这一工作仍有个别地方作得不好。如怀来县榆林屯在给烈、军属压绿肥时，只求数量不求质量。这是不对的。
    （四）察南提倡村村修建公共厕所，帮助烈、军属积肥；并规定机关、学校的粪便归烈、军属所有，确定专人负责挖厕、垫厕，把肥料积起来，按季节分给烈、军属使用。赤城县现已建立厕所五百零八处。该县机关、学校的粪便也都分给了烈、军属。但怀来县政府却把应分给烈、军属使用的粪便换菜吃了，这是不对的。该省计划今后普遍推广察南的办法，并提出在察北应保证烈、军属户户都修建厕所。
    （五）各县除强调供销合作社在贷肥时应优先贷给烈、军属外，又用优军粮给烈、军属购买肥料。据统计，察南专署共买大粪干三十万斤，怀安县买麻饼一万七千五百一十七斤，赤城买肥料四万斤。均发给了缺肥的烈、军属。
    由于政府和群众的积极帮助，该省烈、军属的肥料问题已经基本解决。烈、军属反映良好。如怀来县军属七十多岁的程老太太在分到肥料后说：“我今天就写信把乡亲们对我的照顾告诉我儿子，让他不要想我，好好在前方打美国鬼子！”
    今年察哈尔省虽然用各种方法解决了烈、军属的缺肥问题，但仍有个别村庄和个别烈、军属土地的施肥量未达到一般水平。如宣化五区海儿洼村，群众的土地每亩平均施肥五驮，而烈、军属的土地每亩平均施肥三驮。为了纠正这种不良现象，现在该村正设法给烈、军属的土地施追肥。
    为彻底解决烈、军属的肥料问题，该省除计划继续采用上述办法外，还打算把中央拨来的老区救济费全数购买羊只，分给老区、半老区的贫苦烈、军属。这样既能发展副业生产，又能帮助烈、军属积肥。
