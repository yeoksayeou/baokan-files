Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 14th: Recent activities of the U.S. military and the news revealed by the American press are increasingly exposing the fact that the U.S. side is conspiring to wreck the armistice negotiations and expand the war of aggression against Korea.

    A dispatch from Tokyo by United Press on the 11th nakedly revealed the aforementioned conspiracy of the U.S. side. This dispatch was written by Holbrecht, the Asia General Manager of the agency, who is very close to the U.S. military. He said without concealment: "The United Nations negotiators have again asked for a recess in the Korean armistice talks, to let the Communists know that the free countries are tired of this ridiculous negotiation and are willing to fight it out on the battlefield if the Communists refuse to agree to an honorable peace (i.e., accept the U.S.'s absurd and unreasonable conditions)." He said, "It is said that Van Fleet has already devised several plans for attacking the Communist forces," "Van Fleet is waiting for a signal from Clark or a signal from the highest United Nations authority in the United States through Clark."

    Various indications show that the U.S.'s conspiracy to expand the war is being intensified step by step. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on July 31, the U.S. aggressor troops are stepping up the concentration of troops. The dispatch said: "The Eighth Army in the Far East has two divisions of troops trained for landing behind enemy lines. General Weyland, commander of the U.S. Far East Air Force, recently said in Tokyo that the Air Force has increased its offensive aircraft; and the number of aircraft carriers and other warships of the Navy on both coasts of Korea is greater than ever before."

    At the same time, Clark has taken a series of measures to prepare for combat. According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 12th: "Reliable sources told a United Press reporter that when Clark took over the United Nations forces from Ridgway, he was not completely satisfied with the United Nations forces, so he made some changes to be better prepared for large-scale warfare that might occur if the armistice negotiations completely failed. People close to the commander-in-chief of the United Nations forces said that Clark now feels the situation is much better." The dispatch said, "One of the biggest changes Clark made" was to let Van Fleet focus on preparing for combat: "Van Fleet's current task is combat. He can now devote all his time, talent and energy to conducting the war." The dispatch revealed: "Since all the major Korean war plans are drafted at Clark's headquarters or passed down from Washington through his headquarters, Clark ordered his subordinates to be particularly careful to keep military secrets." While the American aggressors were actively carrying out military deployments, Clark, commander-in-chief of the U.S. aggressor troops in Korea, suddenly flew from Tokyo to Korea on the 12th. According to Reuters, Clark "will discuss future combat plans with Eighth Army Commander Van Fleet" and will go to the front to inspect.

    The above-mentioned situations, as well as the U.S. side's refusal to negotiate in the negotiations, the implementation of long-term recesses, repeated violations of the Kaesong Neutral Zone, and intensified bombing of peaceful towns in Korea, not only clearly show that the U.S. side currently has no sincerity in the armistice negotiations, but also shows that the U.S. side is actively conspiring to wreck the negotiations and expand the war of aggression against Korea.

    Observers here point out that if the U.S. side has not yet learned enough lessons from its failures, and dares to defy the world, recklessly wreck the negotiations, and expand the war of aggression against Korea, it will inevitably be severely punished by the strong Korean and Chinese People's Army, and face stronger condemnation and opposition from the people of the world. The facts are ruthless. Since October 25, 1950, under the blows of the Korean and Chinese People's Army, more than 500,000 U.S. and Rhee's troops have been wiped out, including more than 200,000 U.S. troops. American money and war materials have suffered serious consumption, the morale of the U.S. military is declining, and the United States is becoming more and more politically isolated. The desperate American aggressors have carried out poison gas warfare and even inhumane germ warfare, but they have been crushed by the heroic Korean and Chinese people. If the American aggressors dare to expand the war of aggression against Korea, they will never get any other result except to break their heads and bleed once again.

### 侵朝美军加紧进行扩大战争的阴谋准备

    侵朝美军加紧进行扩大战争的阴谋准备
    【新华社开城十四日电】最近美国军方的活动和美国新闻机关透露的消息，日益清楚地暴露出：美方正阴谋不惜破坏停战谈判，扩大侵朝战争。
    合众社在十一日从东京发出的消息，赤裸裸地暴露出美方的上述阴谋。这则消息是与美国军方十分接近的该社驻亚洲总经理霍布莱契特写的。他毫不掩饰地说：“联军谈判代表又要求朝鲜停战谈判休会，让共方知道自由国家对这种无聊的谈判已经感到厌烦，如果共方不肯同意一个荣誉的和平（即接受美方的荒谬无理的条件），他们情愿到战场上去打个结果出来。”他说：“据说范佛里特已经想好了几个进攻共军的计划”，“范佛里特正在等待克拉克发出的信号或是在美国的联合国最高当局通过克拉克发出的信号。”
    各种迹象表明：美方扩大战争的阴谋准备正在一步步加紧进行。据美联社汉城七月三十一日电透露，美国侵略军正在加紧集结军队。该电说：“第八军在远东已有两师受过敌后登陆训练的军队。（美远东空军司令）威兰将军最近在东京说：空军已经增加了进攻的飞机；而海军在朝鲜两海岸的航空母舰和其他军舰的数目也比以前任何时候都多。”
    与此同时，克拉克进行了一系列准备作战的措施。据合众社东京十二日电说：“可靠人士告合众社记者说：当克拉克从李奇微手中把联合国军接过来时，他对联合国军不是完全满意的，因而他作了若干变动，以便在应付停战谈判完全失败时所发生的大规模战事方面，能有更好的准备。这些接近联军总司令的人士说，克拉克现在感觉情况已好多了。”该电说：“克拉克所作的最大改变之一”，是让范佛里特专心准备作战：“范佛里特现在的任务是作战。他现在可以把他的全部时间、才能和精力用来进行战争。”该电透露：“由于一切主要的朝鲜作战计划都是在克拉克总部草拟的，或从华盛顿经过他的总部传下去，因此克拉克命令所属要特别谨慎的保守军事秘密。”在美国侵略者积极进行军事部署之时，侵朝美军总司令克拉克突于十二日由东京飞至朝鲜，据路透社透露：克拉克“将与第八军军长范佛里特讨论未来的作战计划”，并将到前线去视察。
    上述种种情形，以及美方在谈判中拒绝协商、实行长期休会、一再侵犯开城中立区、加紧进行轰炸朝鲜和平城镇的行为，不仅清楚地说明了美方目前对停战谈判毫无诚意，而且说明了美方正积极阴谋破坏谈判和扩大侵朝战争。
    此间观察家指出：如果美方还没有接受足够的失败教训，甘冒天下之大不韪，悍然破坏谈判，扩大侵朝战争，它必将受到坚强的朝中人民军队最严厉的惩罚，和全世界人民的更强烈的谴责和反对。事实是无情的。从一九五○年十月二十五日以来，在朝中人民军队的打击下，美、李侵略军已有五十多万人被歼灭，其中美军有二十多万。美国的金钱及战争物资遭到严重的消耗，美军的士气日益衰落，美国在政治上也愈加陷于孤立。走头无路的美国侵略者进行了毒气战以至灭绝人性的细菌战，但是都被英勇的朝中人民所粉碎。美国侵略者如果胆敢扩大侵朝战争，它除了再一次碰得头破血流而外，是决不能得到任何其他的结果。
