    Tangshan Railway Factory's Self-Criticism Regarding the Electrocution Death of a Worker

    To the Editor: Yang Zifeng's letter in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on July 25th criticized our factory for violating the People's Government's decrees by electrifying the power grid during the day, resulting in the death of a worker. This criticism is entirely correct.

    The occurrence of this incident was mainly due to the bureaucracy of our factory's leading cadres. For a long time, we were unaware that the power grid was energized during the day, nor did we read the "Tangshan Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau Provisional Measures for the Management of Power Grids" published in the Tangshan Labor Daily. After the incident, we made three written and oral self-criticisms. The occurrence of this unfortunate accident has greatly educated us. We hope the higher authorities will give us the punishment we deserve, and we are determined to improve our work. We have already provided appropriate compensation to the deceased and their families in accordance with the Labor Insurance Regulations. Regarding the management of the power grid, we have decided that our factory's Security Section will be responsible for following the power grid electrification times stipulated by the People's Government. We will also install 100 new warning signs, several red and green warning lights, and stipulate that regular inspections and repairs be carried out to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

    唐山铁路工厂对电网触死工人事故的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报七月二十五日的读者来信栏发表的杨紫枫批评我厂违反人民政府法令，昼间电网放电，造成触死工人事件。这个批评是完全正确的。
    这一事件的发生，主要是由于我厂领导干部的官僚主义造成的。我们长期地不知道电网上日间有电，也没有看唐山劳动日报上公布的“唐山市人民政府公安局管理电网暂行办法”。事件发生后，我们曾作了三次书面和口头检讨。这次不幸事故的发生，大大地教育了我们，我们希望上级给我们以应得的处分，并决心改进我们的工作。对于死难者及其家属，我们已按照劳动保险条例适当的处理了。至于电网的管理问题，决定由我厂保卫科负责，依照人民政府规定的电网放电时间，并新装标示一百个，红绿标灯数处，并规定按期检查，随时检修，保证今后不再发生类似事件。
