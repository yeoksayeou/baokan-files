Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th—General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, issued an order on the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the "August 15th" Korean Liberation Day, stating:

    Soldiers and non-commissioned officers of our Army, Navy, and Air Force! Comrade commanders and political workers!

    Dear comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers!

    Brothers and sisters of the entire nation!

    Today, amidst the great Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people, we celebrate the seventh anniversary of our country's liberation from the shackles of Japanese imperialist colonial rule, thanks to the great Soviet army.

    It has been more than two years since our peaceful construction was interrupted by the armed aggression of the U.S. imperialist aggressors. The U.S. aggressors launched this unprecedented and destructive criminal war, attempting to enslave our country and our people. However, due to the powerful blows of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the enemy has not achieved this goal, and their sinister plan of aggression has finally failed.

    The order pointed out: The U.S. aggressors have suffered irreparable military defeats in the two years of the war. The ferocious armed interventionists have suffered enormous losses in personnel and combat equipment. The order continued: In order to avenge their military defeats and delay their fate of destruction on the Korean battlefield, the U.S. fascist bandits are frantically bombing our cities, abusing and slaughtering our captured personnel, and using bacteriological and chemical weapons. At the same time, the U.S. imperialists do not want to resolve the only outstanding issue in the Panmunjom armistice negotiations—the repatriation of prisoners of war—on a legitimate basis that complies with the principles of the Geneva International Convention. However, the extremely vicious and inhuman criminal acts of the U.S. armed interventionists can only further expose them as enemies not only of the Korean people but also of the people of the world.

    The order stated: Brave soldiers and officers of the People's Army! Soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers! We, the Korean people, are confident that you will bring the banner of final victory with your heroic struggle.

    The guiding and directing force of the Korean people—the Korean Workers' Party—is contributing all its strength to winning the final victory over the hateful enemy. Our rear is as solid as a bronze wall.

    The Korean people are receiving sincere material and spiritual support and assistance from the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people of various people's democratic countries, as well as the peace-loving people of the world. In particular, the fraternal Chinese people have launched the Resist-U.S., Aid-Korea Movement and have sent their outstanding sons and daughters—the Volunteer Army troops—to directly aid us with force.

    We already possess all the conditions necessary for victory. However, victory will not come on its own. In order to expel and eliminate the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys from our national territory, you are required to fulfill your responsibilities to the people selflessly, with an indomitable spirit of perseverance and military combat skills.

    Soldiers and officers of the People's Army! Exert your greatest efforts to further strengthen the powerful force that defends the independence and freedom of our country from the aggression of the imperialist aggressors—the combat effectiveness of the People's Army.

    The order concluded: On the occasion of our national holiday—the seventh anniversary of the "August 15th" Liberation—while congratulating you, I order:

    To commemorate the seventh anniversary of "August 15th," the liberation of our country thanks to the great Soviet army from the shackles of Japanese imperialism, let each of the cities of Pyongyang, Wonsan, and Hamhung fire twenty salvos from two hundred and forty artillery pieces.

    Long live the seventh anniversary of the liberation of the Korean people!

    Long live the liberator of the Korean people—the great Soviet Union and its powerful army!

    Long live the international friendship and solidarity with the people of various people's democratic countries and the peace-loving people of the world, headed by the great Soviet people!

    Long live our glorious fatherland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

    Long live the heroic Korean People's Army!

    Long live the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers!

    Eternal glory to the soldiers of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as our patriotic martyrs, who heroically sacrificed themselves in the Fatherland Liberation War for the independence, freedom, and honor of our country!

    Send the U.S. armed aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang to their graves!

    “八·一五”朝鲜解放七周年纪念日
    金日成将军发布庆祝命令
    【新华社平壤十八日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军在“八·一五”朝鲜解放七周年纪念日发布命令称：
    我们陆、海、空军战士、下士同志们！指挥官和政治工作人员同志们！
    亲爱的中国人民志愿军同志们！
    全国同胞兄弟姊妹们！
    今天我们在朝鲜人民伟大的祖国解放战争的环境中，迎接我们祖国由于伟大的苏联军队而从日本帝国主义殖民地统治的羁绊下获得解放的七周年纪念日。
    自从我们的和平建设因为美帝国主义侵略者的武装进攻而中断以来，到现在已经两年多了。美国侵略者发动了这次史无前例的破坏性的罪恶战争，妄想奴役我们的国家与我国人民，但是，由于英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的强有力的打击，敌人并没有达到这个目的，敌人凶恶的侵略计划终于破产了。
    命令指出：美国侵略者在战争的两年中遭到了不可挽救的军事惨败。凶恶的武装干涉者在人员与战斗器材上遭受了莫大的损失。命令接着说：美国法西斯匪徒为了报复军事失败并延迟他们在朝鲜战场上毁灭的命运，正在疯狂地轰炸我们的城市，虐待和屠杀我方被俘人员，使用细菌及化学武器。同时，美帝国主义者并不想在符合日内瓦国际协定原则的正当基础上解决板门店停战谈判中唯一未解决的问题——战俘遣返问题。但是，美国武装干涉者们穷凶极恶丧失人性的犯罪行为，只能更加暴露他们不仅是朝鲜人民而且是全世界人民的仇敌。
    命令说：英勇的人民军全体将士们！中国人民志愿军将士们！我们朝鲜人民确信你们必将以自己英雄的斗争带来最后胜利的旗帜。
    朝鲜人民的指导与向导的力量——朝鲜劳动党为了对可恨的敌人赢得最后胜利，正在贡献着全部力量。我们的后方像铜墙铁壁一样地坚固。
    朝鲜人民受着苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家人民以及全世界爱好和平人民在物质上与精神上的真挚支持和援助。特别是兄弟般的中国人民展开了抗美援朝运动，派遣了自己优秀的儿女——志愿军部队直接用武力援助着我们。
    我们业已具有必胜的各种条件。但是，胜利是不会自己到来的。为了从我们祖国疆土上驱逐、消灭美国侵略者及其走狗，要求你们以百折不屈的坚韧刚毅精神和军事战斗技能，在人民面前忘我地完成自己的责任。
    人民军全体将士们！尽你们的最大力量，更进一步加强从帝国主义侵略者的侵略中捍卫我们祖国的独立和自由的强大力量——人民军的战斗力。
    命令最后说：值此我们民族的节日——“八·一五”解放七周年之际，在向你们祝贺的同时，我命令：
    为了纪念我们祖国由于伟大的苏联军队而从日本帝国主义羁绊下获得解放的“八·一五”七周年，在平壤、元山、咸兴各以二百四十门礼炮发炮二十响。
    朝鲜人民解放七周年万岁！
    朝鲜人民的解放者——伟大的苏联及其强大的军队万岁！
    与以伟大的苏联人民为首的各人民民主国家人民和世界爱好和平人民的国际友谊团结万岁！
    我们光荣的祖国朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    英雄的朝鲜人民军万岁！
    英雄的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    在争取我们祖国的独立自由与荣誉的祖国解放战争中英勇牺牲的人民军和中国人民志愿军将士以及我们的爱国烈士们永垂不朽！
    把美国武装侵略者和李承晚匪帮送进坟墓去！
