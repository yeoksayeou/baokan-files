The construction of old revolutionary base areas in North China has achieved great success. Since the Central People's Government sent a delegation to visit the people of the old revolutionary base areas in North China last year, and invited representatives from the old revolutionary base areas to participate in the National Day celebrations, the people of the old revolutionary base areas have further realized Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government's earnest concern for them, and their political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm have been greatly enhanced. Leading cadres at all levels in various regions have also recognized the great political significance of strengthening the construction of the old revolutionary base areas. This year, in accordance with the State Council's "Instructions on Strengthening the Work of Old Revolutionary Base Areas," North China has focused on the following tasks:

(1) Provinces and some special districts and counties have organized old revolutionary base area construction committees to strengthen leadership over the construction work of the old revolutionary base areas.

(2) They have begun to formulate more comprehensive and long-term construction plans. Provinces and some special districts, counties, and villages have all formulated comprehensive and long-term construction plans based on the principle of "combining solving the current living difficulties of the masses with long-term construction," and in accordance with the principle of focusing on restoring and developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production, based on the specific situation and local conditions.

(3) In order to ensure the realization of the plan, in addition to the loans and preferential relief funds allocated by the central government, various regions have also drawn a sum of funds from local finances to support the construction of the old revolutionary areas. The total amount of funds used in the region is more than 100 billion yuan. According to statistics from the three provinces of Pingyuan, Hebei, and Suiyuan, about 60 percent was used for economic construction, about 9 percent for transportation construction, about 11 percent for cultural, educational, and health undertakings, and about 20 percent for preferential treatment and relief undertakings.

(4) The three provinces of Chahar, Pingyuan, and Suiyuan, and some counties, have convened people's representative conferences in the old revolutionary base areas to further discuss the principles and tasks of old area construction. This is of great benefit to strengthening the connection between the people's government and the people of the old revolutionary base areas, concentrating mass opinion, and solving specific problems in the construction of the old areas.

(5) Various regions have organized a large number of cadres and cultural, educational, and technical personnel to go deep into the countryside to specifically lead the production work and cultural life of the old areas and help the masses solve difficulties.

These measures have greatly encouraged the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, and have brought the construction work of the old revolutionary base areas in North China to a new stage of organized and led mobilization of the masses for comprehensive construction. This spring, the cultivation and fertilization in the rural areas of various old revolutionary base areas have been greatly improved compared with previous years. Changzhi Special District has repaired and transformed 5.5 million mu of terraced fields. The old areas of 80 counties in Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar provinces have expanded paddy fields by more than 910,000 mu. Heshun County, Shanxi Province, originally had less than 100 mu of paddy fields, but this year it expanded to 19,000 mu. In terms of afforestation: 99 counties in Hebei, Shanxi, and Chahar planted more than 25.3 million trees; 13 counties in Hebei and Chahar closed mountains for forest cultivation of 135,000 mu; 43 counties in Hebei Province afforested 50,000 mu of sandy wasteland and sowed tree seeds on 17,000 mu of barren mountain land; many areas have planted a large number of fruit trees; and forest protection organizations have been consolidated more than before. The animal husbandry industry in the old areas has also developed greatly. According to statistics from 11 counties in Shanxi and Chahar provinces alone, the number of large livestock has increased by more than 15,000 heads; and the number of sheep in five counties has increased by 25,000. Fuping County, Hebei Province, originally had 75,000 sheep last year, and this spring it increased to 105,000. This spring, Hebei established 33 animal husbandry and veterinary stations in mountainous areas, initially solving the problem of preventing and controlling animal epidemics.

With the development of the patriotic production increase movement, mutual aid and cooperation have also taken a leap forward. For example, in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, the proportion of people participating in mutual aid teams last year was 45 percent of the total labor force, which increased to 77 percent this spring; the county added 4,800 new farm tools, most of which were purchased by mutual aid teams. In Jianping County, the proportion of male laborers participating in mutual aid teams increased from the original 30 percent to 71 percent, and the proportion of female laborers increased from 9 percent to 44 percent.

The cultural and educational work in the old revolutionary base areas has also developed considerably. Six counties in the old area of Chahar Province have newly established 156 schools, so that 80 percent of the villages have schools; school buildings have also been repaired, and four counties have built more than 3,800 school buildings.

At present, some leading cadres still lack confidence in building the old areas and are not effective in their leadership; or they only focus on solving current difficulties and neglect long-term construction. Many special districts and counties still do not have specific plans for building the old areas, or if they do have plans, they are too conservative. These places still need to be further improved.

    华北老根据地建设工作走上了新阶段
    各省和部分专区、县开始有组织有计划地发动老区群众进行全面的长期的建设工作
    华北区老根据地建设工作已有很大成绩。自去年中央人民政府派访问团访问了华北老根据地人民，并邀请各老根据地代表参加国庆观礼后，老根据地人民更进一步地体会到毛主席和中央人民政府对他们的殷切关怀，政治热情和生产热情大为提高。各地各级领导干部也认识了加强老根据地建设工作的重大政治意义。今年华北各地根据政务院“关于加强老根据地工作的指示”，着重进行了下列工作：
    （一）各省及部分专区和县组织了老根据地建设委员会，加强了对老根据地建设工作的领导。
    （二）开始制订了比较全面和长期的建设计划。各省及部分专区、县、村庄都本着“解决群众当前生活困难和长期建设相结合”的方针，按照以恢复和发展农林畜牧和副业生产为中心的原则，根据情况，因地制宜，确定了全面的长期的建设计划。
    （三）为了保证计划的实现，各地除了中央拨付的贷款和优抚救济款外，还从地方财政中抽出一笔资金，用于扶持老区建设。全区用款共计一千多亿元。根据平原、河北、绥远三省统计，用在经济建设方面的约占百分之六十，用在交通建设方面的约占百分之九，用在文教卫生事业方面的约占百分之十一，用在优抚救济事业方面的约占百分之二十。
    （四）察哈尔、平原、绥远三省和部分县都召开了老根据地人民代表会议，进一步讨论了老区建设的方针和任务。这对于加强人民政府和老根据地人民的联系、集中群众意见解决老区建设的具体问题，都有很大好处。
    （五）各地组织了大批干部和文教、技术人员，深入农村，具体领导老区的生产工作和文化生活，帮助群众解决困难。
    以上这些措施大大地鼓舞了老根据地人民的政治热情和生产热情，使华北老根据地建设工作走上了有组织有领导地发动群众进行全面建设的新阶段。今春各个老根据地农村在耕作、施肥方面比往年大为提高。长治专区共修整梯田改造土壤五百五十万亩。山西、河北、察哈尔三省八十个县的老区，共扩大水田九十一万多亩。山西省和顺县原有水田不到百亩，今年就扩大了一万九千亩。植树造林方面：河北、山西、察哈尔九十九个县植树二千五百三十多万株；河北、察哈尔十三个县封山育林十三万五千亩；河北省四十三县沙荒造林五万亩，在山荒地带播树种一万七千亩；不少地区大量种植了果树；护林组织也比以前巩固得多了。老区畜牧业也有很大的发展，仅据山西、察哈尔两省十一个县的统计，共增加大牲畜一万五千多头；五个县增加羊两万五千只。河北省阜平县去年原有羊七万五千只，今春增加到十万五千只。河北今春在山区建立了畜牧兽医站三十三处，初步解决了防治畜疫的问题。
    随着爱国增产运动的开展，互助合作也跃进了一步。如河北省武安县去年参加互助组的占总劳力的百分之四十五，今春增到百分之七十七；全县新添农具四千八百件，大部分是互助组购置的。建屏县参加互助组的男劳力由原来的百分之三十增加到百分之七十一，女劳力由百分之九增加到百分之四十四。
    老根据地的文教工作也有相当的发展。察哈尔省六个县老区新设立学校一百五十六处，使百分之八十的村庄有了学校；校舍也有所修补，四个县盖校舍三千八百多间。
    目前仍有部分领导干部，对建设老区信心不足，领导不力；或只重视解决当前的困难，忽视进行长期建设。不少专区和县对建设老区还没有具体计划，或有计划而太保守。这些地方都还须进一步改进。（华北行政委员会通讯组）
