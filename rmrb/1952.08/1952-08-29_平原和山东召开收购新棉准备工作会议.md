Pingyuan and Shandong Hold Meetings to Prepare for New Cotton Purchase

In order to successfully complete this year's new cotton purchasing task, the Pingyuan Province Cooperative General Headquarters convened a meeting of the special district and county cooperatives at the end of June to prepare for cotton purchasing. The meeting discussed autumn cotton purchasing plans, the establishment of cotton purchasing stations and processing plants, and the training of technical personnel.

Based on the experience of cotton purchasing work in 1951, the meeting believed that the establishment of cotton purchasing stations and processing plants this year should implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. Compared with last year, they should be appropriately concentrated, focusing on promoting the method of collective cotton sales. Last November, Tangyin County Cooperative established 24 cotton purchasing stations and 24 processing plants, equipped with 402 cadres, and purchased more than 698,000 catties of cotton. The representatives at the meeting conducted planning and accounting, preparing to set up only 14 cotton purchasing stations and 10 processing plants in November, equipped with 224 cadres (16 people per station). It is estimated that 2 million catties of ginned cotton can be purchased if the masses implement collective cotton sales. The county also plans to improve packaging technology, reduce administrative management costs, and accumulate funds of 1 billion yuan during the processing. The above facts prove that as long as careful accounting is carried out in the cotton purchasing and processing process, a large amount of expenses can be saved. This reversed the erroneous thinking of some cadres who violated the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, and made everyone revise the original plan. For example, Wen County originally planned to set up 11 cotton purchasing groups and 5 cotton purchasing stations. After discussion at the meeting, it absorbed the experience of organizing cotton farmers to sell cotton collectively and decided not to set up cotton purchasing groups anymore, and still be able to complete the task. Other county cooperatives also reviewed the waste phenomenon in last year's cotton purchasing work in the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, and rationally formulated this year's work plan for organizing cotton purchasing.

The Shandong Provincial Financial and Economic Commission convened a provincial cotton purchasing preparation work conference in early August. The meeting believed that making preparations on the basis of the successful conclusion of this year's cotton pre-purchase task to welcome the task of purchasing new cotton is the current urgent task of cooperatives in cotton-producing areas of the province. The meeting pointed out that in order to do this work well, the following work links must be grasped: First, cooperatives in various places should conduct extensive and in-depth patriotic education for cotton farmers, and organize collective cotton sales with mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives that have signed pre-purchase cotton contracts as the core. Second, do a good job in cotton grading and inspection, and correctly implement cotton price policies. Third, do a good job in cotton processing. Shandong Province's power processing equipment has greatly developed since last year, but most factories lack management experience. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the majority of employees to strengthen the management of processing plants. We must continuously improve technology, increase processing volume, reduce fuel consumption and cotton loss, and do a good job in fire prevention and theft prevention to eliminate all liability accidents. Fourth, do a good job in the supply of materials in the purchase of new cotton. The total value of materials that Shandong Province Cooperatives pre-ordered to supply to cotton farmers in the pre-purchase of cotton this year has accounted for 15.55% of the total value of pre-purchased cotton. It is necessary to maintain contract credit and supply on schedule. In August, preparations for organization and material allocation should be made in conjunction with relevant departments.

The meeting stipulated specific standards for the expense rate, capital turnover rate, and cotton loss rate of cotton purchasing stations and processing plants, so as to carry out a mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy through the work of purchasing new cotton.

    平原和山东召开收购新棉准备工作会议
    为了顺利完成今年收购新棉任务，平原省合作总社于六月底召开了各专区社和县社的收棉准备工作会议，讨论秋后收棉计划，收棉站、加工厂的设置和技术人员的训练等问题。
    根据一九五一年度收棉工作的经验，会议认为，今年设置收棉站和加工厂，应贯彻增产节约的精神，较去年适当的集中，着重推广集体售棉的方式。汤阴县社去年十一月份设立了二十四个收棉站，二十四个加工厂，配备干部四百零二人，收棉六十九万八千多斤；到会代表在会议上进行了计划与核算，准备在十一月份只设十四个收棉站，十个加工厂，配备干部二百二十四人（每站十六人），只要群众实行集体售棉，估计可收购皮棉二百万斤。该县并计划在加工过程中，改进打包技术、减少行政管理费用，积累资金十亿元。上述事实证明了在收棉与加工过程中，只要精细地核算，是能节省很大一笔费用的，这就扭转了某些干部的违背增产节约精神的错误思想，使大家修订了原订的计划。如温县原计划设十一个收棉小组，五个收棉站，经过会议讨论，吸收了组织棉农集体售棉的经验，决定不再设立收棉小组，仍可完成任务。其他各县社也都本着增产节约的精神，检查了去年收购棉花工作中的浪费现象，合理地制订了今年组织收购棉花的工作计划。
    山东省财政经济委员会在八月上旬召开了全省的收棉准备工作会议。会议认为，在今年预购棉花任务胜利结束的基础上作好准备工作，迎接收购新棉的任务，是该省产棉区合作社当前的紧急任务。会议指出：为了作好这一工作，必须掌握以下几个工作环节：一、各地合作社应广泛深入地对棉农进行爱国主义教育，以签订了预购棉花合同的互助组、农业生产合作社为核心，组织集体售棉。二、做好棉花分级检验工作，正确贯彻棉价政策。三、作好棉花加工工作。山东省的动力加工设备从去年以来有很大发展，但多数工厂缺乏管理经验，因此，必须依靠广大职工，加强加工厂的管理。要不断改进技术，提高加工量，减少燃料消耗和棉花损耗，并作好防火、防盗工作，消灭一切责任事故。四、作好新棉收购中的物资供应工作。山东省合作社今年在预购棉花中，预订供给棉农的物资总值已占预购棉花总值的百分之十五点五五。必须保持合同信用、按期供应。八月份即应结合各有关部门作好组织准备和物资调运。
    这次会议对收棉站和加工厂的费用率、资金周转率以及棉花损耗率等都规定了具体的标准，以便通过收购新棉工作，开展群众性的增产节约运动。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（李青林）
