Xinhua News Agency, 17th: As the US Air Force's plan to barbarously bomb 78 peaceful cities in North Korea has been severely condemned by the people of Asia and other countries, the US military leaders are hastily trying to cover up this criminal act, desperately trying to portray this massacre of peaceful residents as the bombing of "military targets." However, the flustered American generals inadvertently slapped themselves in the face, proving that the so-called "bombing of military targets" is entirely a fabrication by the American aggressors, aimed at covering up their conspiracy to deliberately massacre peaceful residents and continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea.

After the US Air Force authorities announced this barbaric bombing plan on the 5th, it immediately aroused protests and anger from the people of countries all over the world. Therefore, even "The Washington Post," a mouthpiece of Wall Street, expressed concern in an editorial on the 6th about the consequences of this action. The newspaper worried that "Asia and other countries are likely to raise criticisms against them (referring to the bombing) for what they may regard as wanton destruction of combat," and expressed doubt about whether "the military value of the targets designated for destruction is great enough to justify the other losses that these bombings will cause."

It is precisely because of the unanimous condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world that US generals, from the commander of the Fifth Air Force, Backus, to the commander of the US Far East Air Force, Weyland, the US Air Force Secretary Finletter, and even the Secretary of Defense Lovett, had to come out one by one to issue statements, insisting that the 78 peaceful cities in North Korea prepared for bombing were "military targets," trying to cover up the matter. However, the people of the world are obviously not so easily deceived, therefore, Weyland had to brazenly come out to lie again. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 13th: He said on the 13th that the news about the Allied Air Force commander having stipulated the bombing of 78 cities in North Korea "has been misunderstood," and that "this does not mean that we are about to set out to destroy these 78 cities or the targets near them that are militarily very important." Weyland attempted to use these flowery words to appease the anger of the people of the world. But, at this moment, Weyland revealed his true colors. Weyland said: "Many of the designated cities are currently not worth being targets for bombing." Weyland's statement completely exposed the lies of the aforementioned American generals, and also exposed the lies he himself had just told, proving that the so-called "bombing of military targets" is actually a load of nonsense. Now, the US Air Force is wantonly bombing these cities that are "not worth being targets for bombing," and its purpose is obviously to destroy these peaceful cities and massacre unarmed peaceful residents on a large scale.

People here pointed out that the US imperialists, disregarding international conventions and humanitarian principles, announced the large-scale bombing of peaceful cities in North Korea, not only exposing its barbaric and brutal nature of massacring peaceful residents; at the same time, it also shows that the US side is deliberately sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, which are the focus of attention of people all over the world, and is conspiring to continue and expand the war of aggression against Korea.

### 美方所谓轰炸“军事目标”是侵略者的藉口  其目的是为了掩盖屠杀和平居民和扩大战争的阴谋

    美方所谓轰炸“军事目标”是侵略者的藉口
    其目的是为了掩盖屠杀和平居民和扩大战争的阴谋
    【新华社十七日讯】由于美国空军宣布要对朝鲜北部七十八个和平城市进行野蛮轰炸的计划，受到了亚洲以及其他各国人民的严正谴责，美国军事首脑人物正急急忙忙掩盖这个罪恶行动，竭力想把这个对和平居民的屠杀行为说成是轰炸“军事目标”。然而，心慌意乱的美国将军却不小心打了自己的耳光，证明所谓“轰炸军事目标”云云，完全是美国侵略者编制的谎话，目的是为了掩盖其蓄意屠杀和平居民、继续并扩大侵朝战争的阴谋。
    美国空军当局在五日宣布这个野蛮轰炸的计划之后，立即引起了全世界各国人民的抗议和愤怒。因此，甚至像“华盛顿邮报”这样的华尔街的代言人，也在六日的社论中对于这个行动的后果也表示忧虑起来。该报担心“亚洲及其他各国对于它们
    （按指轰炸）或将视之为肆意破坏的战斗，很可能要提出责难”，并对“指定将破坏的各目标的军事价值，是否大到足以证明这些轰炸将引起的其他损失是正当的”一点，表示怀疑。
    正是由于全世界爱好和平的人民的一致谴责，美国将军们从第五航空队司令巴喀斯起，到美国远东空军司令威兰、美国空军部长芬立脱，以至国防部长罗维特，不得不一个个出来发表声明，一口咬定准备轰炸的朝鲜北部七十八个和平城市是“军事目标”，想把事情就此掩盖过去。然而，全世界人民显然并不那样容易欺骗，因此，威兰不得不再硬着头皮出来撒谎。据美联社东京十三日电：他在十三日说什么关于联军空军司令已规定轰炸北朝鲜七十八个城市的消息“已被误解了”，说什么“这并不意味着我们就要着手来毁灭这七十八个在军事上很重要的城市或者靠近它们的目标”。威兰企图用这一些花言巧语来平息世界人民的愤怒。但是，就在这个时候，威兰露出了马脚。威兰说：“被指定的城市有许多在目前是不值得作为轰炸目标的。”威兰的这句话完全揭穿了上述那些美国将军们的谎话，也揭穿了他自己刚刚说过的谎话，证明所谓“轰炸军事目标”实际上是一派胡言乱语。现在，美国空军却要对这些“不值得作为轰炸目标的”城市放肆地进行轰炸，其目的显然就是要想毁灭这些和平城市，大规模地屠杀手无寸铁的和平居民。
    此间人士指出：美帝国主义不顾国际公约和人道原则，宣布要对朝鲜北部和平城市的大肆轰炸的行为，不仅暴露出它屠杀和平居民的野蛮凶残的本质；同时，也说明了美方蓄意破坏为全世界人民所瞩望的朝鲜停战谈判，并阴谋继续和扩大侵朝战争。
