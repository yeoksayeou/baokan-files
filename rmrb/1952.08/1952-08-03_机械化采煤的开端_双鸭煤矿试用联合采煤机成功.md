    The Beginning of Mechanized Coal Mining
    Shuangyashan Coal Mine Successfully Trials Combined Coal Mining Machine
    The Shuangyashan Mining Bureau has successfully adopted the “Donbass” combine—a combined coal mining machine—from the Donbass coal mines of the Soviet Union.
    Coal mining is a complex and arduous task. The old-fashioned coal mining methods were very unscientific, and the lives of coal miners were constantly under serious threat. Therefore, the complete mechanization of coal mining has become the direction of coal mine development.
    Since the implementation of new coal mining methods in Northeast China's coal mines in 1949, all coal mining faces have been brought onto the right track, creating favorable conditions for mechanized coal mining. Therefore, the degree of mechanization has been increasing year by year in recent years. With the help of Soviet experts, in April 1952, the "Donbass" combine—a combined coal mining machine—began working on the right fourth road of the Lingdong Sixth Inclined Shaft of the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau. This new type of coal mining machine appeared for the first time in China's coal mining industry, and its significance is very important. In the past, mechanized coal mining mainly used coal cutting machines, but coal cutting machines only cut the entire coal into a gap about 1.8 meters deep, that is, only the slotting process could be mechanized, while unloading the coal required additional drilling and blasting, and the unloaded coal had to be loaded into the chute by workers. However, the combine can mechanize the entire coal mining process, such as slotting, unloading, and loading coal, at the same time. The combine's work efficiency is very high. For example, the speed of a general coal cutting machine is a maximum of 0.86 meters per minute, while the combine has four speeds that can be adjusted, with a maximum of 1.08 meters per minute. In the Soviet Union, using a combine for coal mining is 50% more efficient than using a coal cutting machine.
    When the workers first started using the combine coal mining machine, due to unfamiliarity with the operation, they could only complete one to one and a half cycles per day and night. After continuous improvement, as of May 25, they had reached two cycles, and the average daily output increased from 198 tons in the past to 379 tons. This not only created favorable conditions for increasing production, but also transformed heavy physical labor into mechanized labor. This is a pioneering feat in China's coal mining industry.
    On June 26, the Shuangyashan Coal Mine held a celebration meeting at the pithead where the combine was located to celebrate the success of the combine pilot project. At the meeting, representatives of various production groups unanimously expressed their determination to learn from the workers using the combine machine, learn from the advanced Soviet coal mining experience, and strive to create more wealth for the country.

    机械化采煤的开端
    双鸭煤矿试用联合采煤机成功
    双鸭山矿务局采用苏联顿巴斯煤矿的康拜因——联合采煤机成功。
    采煤是件复杂艰巨的工作，旧式的采煤方法很不科学，煤矿工人的生命时刻受着严重的威胁。因此，采煤全部机械化便成为煤矿发展的方向。
    东北煤矿从一九四九年实行新式采煤方法以来，所有采煤掌子都已步入正轨，给机械化采煤创造了有利条件。因此，几年来，机械化的程度是在逐年增加。在苏联专家的帮助下，一九五二年四月间，“顿巴斯”康拜因——联合采煤机开始在双鸭山矿务局岭东六斜井右四路工作了。这部新式采煤机首次出现在中国采煤工业上，其意义非常重大。过去机械化采煤主要是使用截煤机，但截煤机只是把整体的煤割成一条深约一米八的口子，也就是只能使掏槽这一过程机械化，而卸煤还得另打眼放炮，卸下的煤还得用工人装入溜子，而康拜因却能在同一时间内，使掏槽、卸煤、装煤等整个采煤过程机械化。康拜因的工作效率很高，如一般截煤机的速度，每分钟最高为零点八六公尺，而康拜因却有四种速度可供调节，最高每分钟为一点零八公尺，在苏联用康拜因采煤比用截煤机效率要高百分之五十。
    工人在开始使用康拜因采煤机时，由于操作不熟练，每昼夜只能作到一个到一个半循环，经过不断的改进，到五月二十五日止，已达到了两个循环，平均日产量由过去的一百九十八吨提高到三百七十九吨。这不仅给增产创造了有利条件，并且使笨重的体力劳动变为机械化了。这是中国采煤工业上的创举。
    六月二十六日，双鸭煤矿在康拜因所在坑口，举行了康拜因试点成功庆祝大会，会上，各生产小组的代表一致表示决心向使用康拜因机的工人学习，学习苏联采煤先进经验，为给国家创造更多的财富而努力。（刘佐魁、明）
