Continue the Efforts and Fight to Conquer Floods and Ensure a Bumper Harvest

The Chinese people have achieved preliminary victories in their fight against floods on the flood control front.

From late June to mid-August, the water levels of major rivers across the country have been generally stable. However, some local rivers experienced relatively large and intense floods during this period. The Daqing, Yongding, and Jiyun rivers in North China, the Min River in Fujian Province, the Xiang, Zi, and Yuan rivers in Hunan, and some rivers in Northeast China successively rose in July, some even causing floods. More than 40 percent of the causes of the rises were flash floods, while some were affected by rain-carrying typhoons.

Rivers where dangers occurred were mostly spared from accidents after active rescue efforts. Therefore, no major floods occurred during the past stage. According to incomplete statistics from the Central Ministry of Water Resources, the area of ​​flooded land in the country in July was approximately three million mu, a significant decrease compared to the same period last year.

This fact proves that the massive water conservancy projects and embankment reinforcement projects built in our country over the past two or three years have played a certain role. For example, the Hong River, one of the tributaries of the Huai River, had a very large water flow this year. However, because the Shimantan Reservoir and the Laowangpo flood storage depression stored and discharged part of the floodwater, reducing the flow in the upper reaches, the areas downstream of the Hong River, which used to breach every year, did not experience any accidents this year. The Daqing River and Zhang River embankments have also withstood the test of larger floods this year than in previous years after years of repair.

In recent years, leadership organs and the masses at all levels in riverine areas have gradually strengthened various flood control organizations, established and improved various flood control systems, and accumulated certain flood control experience, thereby gaining the initiative in flood control work. This year, flood control command organizations have been generally established in all river basins across the country, and leading cadres of local people's governments have directly participated in flood control command work. Many areas have established a system of specific responsibilities and rewards and punishments in flood control. The mass flood control teams formed in various places this year are very strong. In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River alone, the Jingzhou Special District formed a flood control army of 320,000 people before and during the major flood this year, who could immediately rush to rescue in case of danger. This year, various places have strengthened the flood reporting system, and many areas can predict the flood situation before the floods arrive, thereby increasing the predictability of flood control work. Before the arrival of a huge typhoon this year, East China arranged defense work two days in advance, gaining the initiative and reducing losses. The vast number of cadres and the masses demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and selflessly engaged in battles with floods, turning many dangerous projects into safe ones. For example, Bian Jing (Communist Party member), director of the Dayantang Town Tax Office in Lixian County, Hunan Province, and Bu Xiaoyu (alternate party member, now posthumously recognized as a full party member), deputy district chief of the Ninth District of Yiyang County, sacrificed their lives while leading the masses in rescue operations, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the local people. Xie Zhezhang, secretary of the Communist Party branch of Mawaitou Village in Xiongxian County, Hebei Province, and six workers, including Sun Dianlin, held each other tightly, blocking the breach in the embankment washed away by the flood, preventing the local embankment from collapsing. The people in the riverine areas automatically donated a large number of door panels, furniture, and trees to meet the needs of rescue operations; women and children in the riverine areas braved the heavy rain to transport flood control materials to the embankments and deliver meals to the workers in the struggle against floods. Farmers in some areas signed "Patriotic Flood Control Pledges" and launched flood control competitions. The vast number of farmers truly understand the principle that flood control is to protect production, and their enthusiasm for fighting floods has been unprecedentedly enhanced.

However, judging from the flood control work in the past stage, there are still some problems that must be solved in order to finally overcome the threat of floods.

Because China's water conservancy work has made tremendous achievements, many cadres and the masses have developed serious complacency. They believe that the existing water conservancy projects, flood control facilities, and flood control organizations are capable of preventing floods, so there is no need to do any more work. This is completely wrong. We have indeed built many water conservancy projects in recent years, but some of these projects have not yet undergone rigorous testing, and some have not been fully completed, their role is still very limited, and they cannot completely eliminate floods. Some people think that flood control work has to be done every year and is just a routine matter. Therefore, they do not make active preparations for flood control work before the floods arrive. Once the floods arrive, they are in a hurry to deal with them, and it is too late. The leading cadres of Wuchang County, Songjiang Province, did not make any preparations before the rainfall in late July; from July 21, there were continuous torrential rains, and the floodwaters rose sharply. Rescue was too late, causing the river embankment to breach and flood more than 1.3 million mu of land, causing serious losses to the masses. These people do not understand that before most rivers are completely controlled, we can only rely on flood control work to reduce or eliminate flood disasters.

It is also very necessary to eliminate bureaucratic work styles in flood control work. Flood prevention is like fighting a war. A slight oversight can lead to huge disasters. In the past stage of flood control work, a very small number of cadres and technical personnel showed extremely serious bureaucratic work styles. This spring, Liao Wenhui, director of the Sixth District Flood Control Command Post in Yutian County, Hebei Province, did not construct the embankment according to the prescribed standards when leading the masses to repair the embankment; after the flood control work entered a tense stage, he refused to listen to the command of the general headquarters, and excused himself by saying that it was difficult to walk on the embankment at night, resulting in a dike breach and flooding.

Flood reporting stations and hydrological stations are the eyes and ears of the flood control command department, and the information they provide is an important basis for the flood control command department to determine its policies. However, the information reported by some station staff is inaccurate, which will affect the entire flood control work, and the consequences are unimaginable. This bad style must be eliminated, and those who have committed this kind of error and whose nature is serious must be punished accordingly.

Correctly grasping the timing of flood diversion is also very important in flood control work. In late July, the Daqing River in Hebei Province surged upstream; on the morning of the 25th, the water level at the Xingaifang flood diversion gate in Xiongxian County rose to 14.87 meters, only 0.13 meters lower than the flood diversion water level. The responsible cadres of the local flood diversion department correctly analyzed and grasped the water situation, made up their minds not to divert the flood, and safely passed the flood period. On July 26, the water level of the Jiyun River at Jiuwangzhuang, Jixian County, rose to 9.10 meters, 0.18 meters lower than the flood diversion water level, but the flow rate had exceeded the guaranteed flow rate by 128 cubic meters per second. The competent department did not implement flood diversion according to the flood situation, and the river embankment collapsed on its own, flooding as much as 100,000 mu of land. These two examples fully illustrate that correctly grasping the overall situation to determine the timing of flood diversion is a very important issue.

By mid-August, most of this year's flood season has passed; however, according to past years' experience, there is still a great possibility of floods occurring in various rivers after mid-August. Flood control agencies at all levels and the vast number of cadres and the masses must not be complacent because no major floods have occurred in the past few months. They should closely monitor the flood situation and further improve flood control work on the existing basis. We must continue our efforts and fight to conquer floods and ensure this year's bumper harvest.

### 再接再厉，为战胜洪水、确保农业丰收而斗争

    再接再厉，为战胜洪水、确保农业丰收而斗争
    我国人民在防汛战线上和洪水进行斗争，已经取得了初步的胜利。
    自六月下旬到八月中旬这一阶段中，全国较大的江河的水势，基本上是平稳的。但若干地方性的河流，在这一时期曾经发生了较大较猛的洪水。华北区的大清、永定、蓟运等河，福建省的闽江，湖南的湘、资、沅等水和东北区部分河流，在七月份相继涨水，有的并酿成水灾。涨水原因有百分之四十以上是山洪暴发，有些则是受了挟雨台风的影响。
    发生险象的河流，经过积极抢护，大多没有出险。因此，过去这一阶段没有发生重大的水灾。据中央水利部不完全的统计，七月份全国淹地的面积约三百万亩，比去年同一时期大为减少。
    这种事实证明，我国两三年来兴修的巨大水利工程和堤防加固工程，已经发挥了一定的作用。例如，淮河支流之一的洪河，今年水势很大。但因石漫滩水库和老王坡蓄洪洼地蓄泄了一部分洪水，减少了上游的流量，所以洪河下游过去年年决口的地方，今年都没有出险。大清河、漳河堤防经过历年整修，也在今年承受了比往年为大的洪水的考验。
    几年来，沿河地区各级领导机关和群众逐渐加强了各种防汛组织，建立和健全了各种防汛制度，积累了一定的防汛经验，因而在防汛工作中争取了主动。今年全国各江河流域普遍建立了防汛指挥机构，当地人民政府的领导干部都直接参加了防汛指挥工作。许多地区在防汛中建立了专责制度和奖惩制度。今年各地组成的群众性防汛队伍是很强大的。仅长江中游的荆州专区在今年大汛前和大汛中就组成了三十二万人的防汛大军，遇有险象可立即前往驰救。今年各地都加强了报汛制度，许多地区在洪水到来以前，就能预知洪水的情况，因而增加了防汛工作的预见性。华东区今年在巨大的台风到来以前两天，就布置了防御工作，争取了主动，减少了损失。广大干部和群众发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，忘我地和洪水展开了战斗，使许多险工转危为安。例如，湖南省澧县大堰垱镇税务所所长边境（共产党员），益阳县九区副区长卜晓余（候补党员，现已被追认为正式党员）在领导群众抢险时，牺牲了自己的生命，换得了当地人民生命财产的安全。河北省雄县马务头村中共支部书记谢哲祥和民工孙殿林等六人，紧紧地抱在一起，堵住被洪水冲开的堤洞，使当地堤防没有出险。沿河地区的人民为了满足抢险的需要，自动献出大量的门板、家具和树木；沿河地区的妇女、儿童在和洪水斗争中，冒着大雨，向堤上运送防汛物料和给民工送饭。若干地区的农民订了“防汛爱国公约”，展开了防汛竞赛。广大农民真正认识了防汛就是保产的道理，和洪水斗争的积极性空前提高。
    但是，从过去这一阶段的防汛工作看来，还有些问题必须加以解决，才能最后战胜洪水的威胁。
    由于我国的水利工作已经有了巨大的成绩，许多干部和群众产生了严重的麻痹思想，他们认为已有的水利工程、防汛设施和防汛组织，已能防御洪水，因此不必再作什么工作了。这是完全错误的。几年以来我们的确兴修了许多水利工程，但是，这些工程有的还没有经过严格的考验，有的还没有全部完成，作用还很有限，还不能完全消灭水灾。有些人认为防汛工作年年要作，只是例行的公事，因此，在洪水到来以前，对防汛工作不作积极准备，一旦洪水到来，忙乱应付，为时已晚。松江省五常县领导干部在七月下旬降雨以前，没有进行任何准备工作；从七月二十一日起连降暴雨，洪水猛涨，抢救不及，致河堤决口，淹地一百三十多万亩，使群众遭受了严重的损失。这些人都不了解在大部河流没有实行根治以前，只有依靠防汛工作，才能减少或消灭洪水灾害。
    肃清防汛工作中的官僚主义作风，这也是十分必要的。防水如同打仗，稍一疏忽，就可能酿成巨大的灾害。在过去一个阶段的防汛工作中，有极少数干部和技术人员表现了极严重的官僚主义作风。今年春天，河北省玉田县六区防汛指挥所主任廖文惠领导群众修堤时，就不按规定的标准施工；防汛工作进入紧张阶段以后，他又不听总指挥部指挥，藉口天黑难走不上堤工作，结果造成决堤淹地事件。
    报汛站、水文站是防汛指挥部门的耳目，它们供给的情况是防汛指挥部门确定方针的重要依据。但有些站的工作人员报告情况却是不确实的，这将会影响整个防汛工作，其结果是不堪设想的。这种恶劣作风必须肃清，犯有这种错误而性质严重者，必须受到应得的处分。
    在防汛工作中正确掌握分洪时机，也是非常重要的。七月下旬，河北省大清河上游猛涨；二十五日晨，雄县新盖房分洪口门的水位涨到一四点八七公尺，距分洪水位仅低零点一三公尺。当地分洪部门负责干部正确分析和掌握了水情，下决心没有分洪，安全渡过了洪水期。七月二十六日，蓟县九王庄蓟运河水位上涨到九点一○公尺，较分洪水位低零点一八公尺，流量却已超过保证流量一百二十八秒立方公尺。主管部门没有根据洪水的情况实行分洪，河堤自行溃决，淹地达十万亩。这两个事例充分说明了正确地掌握全面情况以确定分洪时机，是一个十分重要的问题。
    到八月中旬，今年的汛期已经过去了一大半；但是，根据历年的情况，八月中旬以后，各江河仍有发生洪水的极大可能。各级防汛机构和广大干部群众，绝不要因为过去数月来没有发生较大的洪水，就麻痹大意，应该严密注视洪水的情况，在现有的基础上，进一步把防汛工作做好。我们要再接再厉，为战胜洪水，确保今年的农业丰收而斗争。
