    Importance of Surveying and Investigation Before Design

    To the Editor: After the People's Daily published an editorial on June 16th last year entitled "Construction is Impossible Without Engineering Design," many blind constructors reversed the tendency to start construction without design. This is very beneficial to basic construction work. However, judging from this year's basic construction projects, the design work is still not entirely practical. For example, some projects in Beijing started drawing designs blindly without proper surveying and investigation, resulting in waste and even disrupting the original construction plans.

    The Beijing Municipal Party School's building project already had lightning rods installed on the three surrounding buildings. They didn't need to install new ones, but they did anyway, wasting 8 million yuan. The foundation of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital construction site was not properly surveyed beforehand, and water appeared when digging the trenches. More than 4,000 wooden piles had to be driven in to strengthen the foundation, wasting more than 1 billion yuan. Similarly, in the case of the Shijingshan construction workers' dormitory, the construction site was not thoroughly investigated. The designer simply marked it on a 1:5000 map, and as a result, the doors of the building faced the mountain when construction was completed. The above problems show that dogmatism and empiricism still exist among our designers, and they underestimate the actual conditions of the construction site. Therefore, I suggest that those engaged in basic construction should earnestly study Chairman Mao's "On Practice." It should be emphasized that design and construction are impossible without thorough surveying and investigation.　Cheng Xu

    设计前应重视勘察和调查
    编辑同志：人民日报在去年六月十六日以“没有工程设计就不可能施工”为题发表社论后，许多盲目施工者都扭转了不设计就施工的倾向。这对基本建设工作益处很大。但从今年的基本建设工程中来看，设计工作还不是完全切合实际的。如北京的一些工程就是没有经过很好的勘察和调查，就盲目地搞起图样设计来，结果造成了浪费，甚至打乱了原来的施工计划。
    中共北京市委党校的楼房工程，周围原有的三座楼房均各设有避雷针，他们可以不必另设，可是也同样做了一份，浪费了八百万元。北京苏联红十字医院工地地基，由于事先没有很好的勘察，刨槽时出了水，不得不打上四千多根木桩，以使地基坚固，浪费了十亿多元。又如石景山建筑工人宿舍时，没有周密的调查施工地点，设计者只凭在一张五千分之一的地图上标志一下，结果施工时发现房门面朝山。上述问题说明了在我们的设计人员中，还存在着教条主义和经验主义的思想，轻视工地现场实际情况。因此，我建议搞基本建设的人员，应认真学习毛主席的“实践论”。并且应该强调没有周密的勘察和调查就不能设计和施工。　程序
