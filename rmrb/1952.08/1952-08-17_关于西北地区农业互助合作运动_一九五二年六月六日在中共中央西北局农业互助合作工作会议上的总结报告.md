This meeting is timely and necessary. The rural production mutual aid and cooperation movement is the biggest thing since the land reform. Everyone has talked a lot, I will only talk about a few issues.

I.

The land reform in the four provinces within the Northwest region has basically been completed. Xinjiang generally implemented rent reduction starting last winter, and land reform will also be implemented this autumn. Since liberation, the farmers' constantly increasing enthusiasm for production has increased even more after the land reform. The farmers' enthusiasm for production is also reflected in labor mutual aid and production cooperation. This year, agricultural labor mutual aid organizations in the Northwest region have developed greatly. According to incomplete statistics at hand, there are already more than 620,000 mutual aid teams in the five provinces and one city in the Northwest (statistics from only 213 counties, including 129 agricultural production cooperatives), with more than six million laborers organized into mutual aid teams. In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, the labor force organized accounts for about 45% of the total labor force; in individual places, like Gaoling County, almost 80% of the labor force is organized into mutual aid teams. The situation in Gansu and Ningxia provinces is generally the same. Qinghai Province has more, generally around 80%. The labor mutual aid movement in the new district's rural areas has mainly developed last year and this year. This year's development is even greater, with each province developing more than twice as much as last year.

This trend is very natural. Land reform solved the main conditions for farmers' production, namely land and a part of the main means of production, but did not solve all the farmers' production problems. Here is a material, a survey of Gaojiawan Village in Chang'an County: of the 167 farmer households in the whole village, eight hired peasant households still had no livestock at all; 107 poor peasant households only had 36 households with livestock, and 71 households still had no livestock; 52 middle peasant households also had five households lacking livestock. There was a great shortage of carts and waterwheels. Hired peasants had neither; the 107 poor peasant households only had two carts and three waterwheels; the 52 middle peasant households only had four carts, four small carts, and six waterwheels. Poor peasants still lacked many other farm tools, middle peasants also lacked some, and hired peasants lacked even more. It is very clear that organizing mutual aid to solve production difficulties has become an urgent need for farmers.

Let me give some more materials. Gao Sanjin mutual aid team in Weijia Village, Baishui County, Shaanxi Province, with eight people, weeded 194.6 mu of wheat fields in nine days, an average of 2.7 mu per person per day. Sixteen people in the same village who were not organized only weeded 174 mu in ten days, only 1.1 mu per person per day. The labor efficiency of the mutual aid team was more than twice that of an individual. In Chaoyi County, 3,000 mu of cotton fields in the third district and fifth township took ten and a half days to plant last year. This year, 96 mutual aid teams were organized, and it took only four and a half days to plant them. Zhao Jiantai and other nine mutual aid teams in Gaojia Village, Chunhua County, organized and freed up some labor to engage in sideline production, earning twelve dan of grain in two months. In many places, well digging and canal construction have been quickly successful because mutual aid teams were organized. The use of new farm tools and machinery is also easier to handle when organized. It is also very clear that organization is conducive to the rapid development of agricultural production, and makes it continuously improve, gradually getting rid of the backward state.

This great development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement is also the result of the farmers' high trust in the Party and the People's Government. When the farmers heard that Chairman Mao was calling on them to organize, they responded actively, saying "Chairman Mao's words are correct". The farmers fully believe in the Party's leadership. However, many of our Party organizations and cadres have great blindness in leading the farmers, in leading this labor mutual aid and production cooperation movement in the countryside. This blindness has greatly damaged the enthusiasm of the farmers and the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and will seriously damage the Party's prestige.

This blindness is manifested in the chaotic state of the movement. Spontaneous phenomena are still numerous. "Good match with good, bad match with bad," and "grab a handful and mix it all up," these are also spontaneous phenomena. Many mutual aid teams still lack leadership, problems occur and no one solves them, and some mutual aid teams are even controlled by rich peasants and even landlord elements. Not all of these 600,000 mutual aid teams that we have organized are reliable. Many of them are formal, made up, "forced to form groups," "copying the list," one order, a dozen mutual aid teams are set up in a village in one morning, "mutual aid teams when going out, but no mutual aid teams in the fields." Some mutual aid teams have indeed been organized to work together, but they don't calculate work points or accounts, "those who suffer losses suffer losses, those who benefit benefit," in short, there are many problems.

Now is the time to change these chaotic phenomena and eliminate the blind state of the movement.

After the land reform, we should continue to help the development of the farmers' individual economy on the one hand, and firmly guide the farmers' economy to gradually move towards collectivization through labor mutual aid and production cooperation on the other. This is the policy determined by our Party. Chairman Mao said in a speech entitled "Get Organized!" in 1943: "For the peasant masses, individual economy has existed for thousands of years, and each household is a production unit. This scattered individual production is the economic basis of feudal rule, which makes the peasants themselves fall into eternal poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize, and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." In another speech entitled "On Cooperatives" in the same year, he also said: "If we do not reform the mode of production from individual labor to collective labor, then the productive forces cannot be further developed. Therefore, the construction of labor mutual aid organizations based on individual economy (without destroying the foundation of individual private property), that is, farmers' agricultural production cooperatives, is very necessary. Only in this way can productive forces be greatly improved." He said, "Such a reform... is a revolution in the production system." He called this reform the "second revolution" after destroying the feudal exploitative relations. The Common Program also stipulated in Article 34 that "In all areas where land reform has been thoroughly implemented, the People's Government should organize farmers and all labor forces that can engage in agricultural production to focus on developing agricultural production and its sideline occupations, and should guide farmers to gradually organize various forms of labor mutual aid and production cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit." Chairman Mao's instructions and the provisions of the Common Program are very clear.

The rural areas have changed greatly in the three years after liberation, and the rural economy has undergone fundamental changes after the land reform. Looking at the survey materials of Gaojiawan Village in Chang'an County, which I mentioned earlier, the land reform there was only completed last spring, and the economy of 104 of the 107 poor peasant households has risen this year, and only three households have not risen because they are elderly or someone is sick. Only one year after the land reform, 30% of the poor peasants have now risen to become middle peasants. It is estimated that after two seasons of crops are harvested this year, the total income of poor peasants will increase by 20% to 25% compared with last year, and 40% compared with before the land reform. A considerable number of poor peasants will have the strength to buy livestock and add farm tools after the summer harvest or autumn harvest this year. There are also several survey materials, and the situation described is roughly similar. The comrades who surveyed Gaojiawan estimated that after this autumn, the proportion of poor peasants who rise to become middle peasants will reach 70% to 80%. This estimate may be too high. Roughly speaking, in areas like Guanzhong in Shaanxi, where land reform has been completed for more than a year, in another two or three years, and in other areas where land reform has just been completed this year, in another three to five years, middle peasants will become the majority of the rural population. This point can be foreseen. However, if we do not lead them and let the farmers' economy develop spontaneously, there will be another situation, that is, the rural class will be re-polarized, a few people will become rich peasants, and the majority of people will go bankrupt again, agricultural production will still remain in a backward state for a long time, it will be difficult to improve, and the development of the rural economy will be very slow and painful. In a new democratic country, although the rich peasant economy can be allowed to be preserved, it is by no means the direction of development of our farmers' economy, and it must be restricted. This is of course not to say that we are "allowing poverty and not allowing wealth," we are precisely asking all farmers to become rich, richer than rich peasants, that is, to take collective labor methods to surpass rich peasants. After the land reform, a certain degree of class polarization among the farmers is of course still not completely avoidable, but as long as we take the method of organizing farmers' mutual aid and cooperation, plus the country's economic and technical assistance, the majority of farmers may maintain the status of middle peasants, avoid re-bankruptcy, and become richer day by day. That's how it is.

Organizing farmers to carry out labor mutual aid and production cooperation or letting them develop spontaneously is a matter of two paths. Comrade Stalin said in "On Several Problems of Leninism": "What road can and should the peasant economy in our country develop along? The peasant economy is not a capitalist economy. The peasant economy, in the vast majority of peasant households, is a small commodity economy. And what is a small commodity peasant economy? It is an economy standing at the crossroads between capitalism and socialism. It can either develop to the capitalist side, as is the case in capitalist countries today, or it can develop to the socialist side, as will happen in our country under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship." He also said in "Foundations of Leninism": "Lenin correctly pointed out in his essay on cooperatives that agriculture in our Russia should develop along a new road, that is, the road of absorbing the majority of peasants to participate in socialist construction through cooperatives, and gradually instilling the principle of collectivism into agriculture, first instilling it into the sale of agricultural products, and then instilling it into the production of agricultural products." Developing rural labor mutual aid and production cooperation is an important way to "gradually instill the principle of collectivism into agriculture" (another way is to develop supply and marketing cooperatives, which we plan to discuss later), and the future is the collectivization of the agricultural economy, which is socialism. If the farmers' economy is allowed to develop spontaneously, the future will be capitalism, which will be full of suffering for the majority of farmers and the people of the country. The latter is to abandon the leadership of the working class, which is a right-wing tendency. The error of spontaneous phenomena in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement lies here.

Chairman Mao said in the article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "The serious problem is the education of the peasants. The peasant economy is scattered, and according to the experience of the Soviet Union, it takes a long time and careful work to achieve agricultural socialization." Lenin also said in his essay "On Cooperatives":

"But in order to enable all peasants to participate in cooperatives through the New Economic Policy - this requires a longer historical era. In the best case, we will have to spend a decade or two to pass through this historical era." Those who are unwilling to spend "effort," unwilling to do "careful work," unprepared to pass through "a longer period of time," and unprepared to "gradually" "attract" peasants to participate in collectivization do not understand the peasants and are bound to be divorced from the peasant masses. How can the masses be ordered around? The peasants said, "Wait and see after the autumn harvest," they want to see the facts, and they want to go through their own personal experience. It is very clear that for the peasants, we can only "gradually" "attract" them, here I will not go into other conditions, etc. for the time being. Labor mutual aid and production cooperation are, in any case, a transitional form from individual to collective. That is to say, they are all "based on individual economy" and "do not destroy the foundation of individual private property." Without the foundation of individual economy, they cannot attract peasants to collectivization. It is of course wrong to disregard the individual economy, to demand too much from the peasants too quickly, or even to rudely infringe upon the individual interests of the peasants.

The above is the basic situation of the current agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement in the Northwest region.

II.

What is the plan for the future? According to our actual situation and experience, what are the requirements for the future? What policies should we adopt?

According to a relatively appropriate estimate, last year, 1951, the total value of agricultural production in our Northwest region increased by about one-tenth compared with before liberation. We require that in the next four or five years, we strive to increase the total value of agricultural production in the region by about one-half compared with now. Areas with better conditions, such as Guanzhong in Shaanxi, should strive for even higher. Under the current conditions, this requirement is roughly appropriate. By next year, the agricultural areas of the five provinces in the Northwest will have completed land reform. After the land reform, we must undoubtedly concentrate all rural work on developing agricultural production and rural sideline occupations. The current state of agricultural production in the Northwest region is still very backward, and some conditions are difficult to change greatly in the short term. This stipulates that we can only first rely on our efforts to fully mobilize the farmers' enthusiasm for production and the power of organization, plus other necessary and possible assistance, so that the existing production capacity in rural areas can be maximized, and gradually improve their own conditions and continue to improve. As long as we truly devote all our energy to rural work to make such efforts, it is possible to increase the level of agricultural production in the Northwest by about half in four or five years.

In terms of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, our plan is that in the next two or three years, we will strive to ensure that 60% to 70% of the labor force in general agricultural areas is indeed organized; in the mutual aid teams, we will strive to ensure that year-round mutual aid teams account for about 20%; each county will try to run one to two agricultural production cooperatives, and hope to do so. Based on this foundation, after five years, more than half of the farmers will be organized into year-round mutual aid teams, and each township will have an agricultural production cooperative. According to experience, this requirement is also roughly appropriate.

Of the 600,000 mutual aid teams we have organized so far, 80% to 90% are small-scale, temporary, and simple labor mutual aid teams, that is, generally called "changing labor" or "exchanging labor." This is a very elementary form, but it is suitable for farmers' original mutual aid habits, convenient to combine, and also adapts to the farmers' current urgent needs. It can solve the difficulties of insufficient labor or livestock or farm tools, can rush to plant, weed, fight insects, or harvest in time, and can also free up some labor to engage in other production. This has already seen great benefits, so it is easily accepted by the vast majority of farmers and is convenient for large-scale development. It is wrong to look down on this kind of mutual aid team. In the next two or three years, we must still first actively and massively promote this kind of mutual aid team in all rural areas; and we are not afraid of trouble, not afraid of repeated efforts to work hard every year and every season, and help them solve various difficulties. If we universally, practically, and not formally achieve 60% of the farmers being organized into this kind of mutual aid team in two or three years, it will lay a good foundation for our agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement to continue to move forward.

Year-round mutual aid teams have already accounted for 30% to 40% of all mutual aid teams in the old liberated areas of northern Shaanxi. The labor mutual aid movement has some foundation, and simple labor exchange cannot meet the farmers' requirements for continued improvement of production. This kind of mutual aid team is bound to and necessarily gradually develop. It is more beneficial than general temporary and seasonal simple labor exchange, it can be further combined with improving technology and operating certain sideline occupations, it can purchase new farm tools or large livestock that individual farmers cannot afford or use, and it can do things that some farmers cannot do, such as building dams and repairing canals. Through this more fixed mutual aid team, we must gradually consolidate the collective labor habits of the peasant masses. At present, there are more of this kind of mutual aid team in Shaanxi, generally accounting for about 10% to 20% of the number of mutual aid teams, but it is not stable; other provinces have very few. After four or five years, it should become the majority of mutual aid teams, otherwise it will not be able to adapt to the development of rural production. However, in the next two or three years, it is appropriate to develop steadily in general newly liberated areas. Because its content is richer and its organization is larger, the problems are more complicated and numerous, and its establishment and consolidation require constantly solving many internal problems, and it needs a certain core element in it, and it is impossible to develop a lot in a short time. This kind of mutual aid team should still not be too large, and it is generally better to be small. Its content has simpler and more complex content, and it should generally be gradually simplified. The mutual aid joint team in Wangmang Village, Chang'an County is a new development, and it is only suitable for trial operation at present. The leading organs in various places should focus on studying the experience of this kind of mutual aid team, closely help consolidate the existing ones, and drive others. Each local party committee and county party committee should personally guide one or two such mutual aid teams, and conduct in-depth and systematic research.

As for agricultural production cooperatives, they should be controlled within the scope of trial operation for a period of time. This kind of agricultural production cooperative is undoubtedly the basic form of future transition from small-scale peasant economy to socialist collective farm. Several years later, it will undoubtedly be the main form of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement at that time. We must see this point. We must prepare for this. However, the development of this kind of agricultural production cooperative requires certain conditions: "The needs of the masses in production, the foundation of the mutual aid movement, the backbone of leadership, the enthusiasm of the masses, and full preparation." Moreover, universal promotion also requires certain corresponding other economic and technical conditions. We should prepare to conduct trials in a guided and planned manner based on conditions in three to five years. It is best that each provincial party committee and local party committee directly conduct one or two trials this year and next year, and then guide each county to conduct trials. One or two agricultural production cooperatives were established in the Northwest region this year. A few of them have certain foundations or are planned for trial operation, but most of them are blindly established, lack the necessary foundations and conditions, and lack leadership. This spring, a county in Mizhi "developed" 63 cooperatives, and a county in Zizhou also established 23 cooperatives in one county. This is blindly pursuing more, and also blindly pursuing bigger. These one hundred or so agricultural production cooperatives should be rectified separately. Those with considerable foundation and conditions should be included in the trial operation plan, strengthen leadership, and do it well. Those without foundation, without conditions, forced to establish, and unable to lead, should persuade the masses to change to other mutual aid teams.

This is our plan, steps, and policies for the future.

Now we will start by rectifying the existing various mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and strive to help them do well in this year's wheat planting and autumn harvest. This is to gain a reliable position for the future advancement of the movement, and we must not slack off.

It is correct to proceed steadily based on possible conditions, based on reliable positions, with preparation, and with leadership.

III.

In organizing mutual aid and cooperation, there are also the following issues that need to be resolved.

1. In organizing mutual aid and cooperation, we must resolutely consolidate the close unity of poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants, as well as all working people in rural areas. In mutual aid teams, we must not squeeze out poor peasants or hired peasants, nor must we suppress middle peasants. We must effectively help poor peasants and hired peasants solve various production difficulties, and at the same time, we must resolutely protect the interests of middle peasants. We must not discriminate against individual farmers outside the mutual aid teams, let alone attack them. We should educate the mutual aid teams to take the initiative to unite them. Poor peasants and hired peasants who have been allocated land are undoubtedly the most active part of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. However, after the land reform, middle peasants will gradually become the majority of the rural population. Insisting on uniting middle peasants is the most important point for our Party to consider in rural policies at any time.

2. Not calculating work points and accounts cannot guarantee mutual benefit among farmers. The exchange ratio of livestock labor and manual labor, as well as the remuneration for the use of other livestock and farm tools, should not be too low in the current situation of lack of livestock and farm tools in many places, harming the farmers' enthusiasm for caring for and adding livestock and farm tools, nor should it be raised too high, causing poor peasants and hired peasants to suffer losses. The calculation method should be suitable for local farmers' habits, simple and easy to implement, not too complicated or messy. Lenin said: "The best methods should be as few as possible, and the clever methods should be as rare as possible."

3. The mutual aid team must first do a good job in production, and the income must be more than that of general farmers. Whether this is achieved is the standard for checking the quality of the work of the mutual aid team. If this is not the case, how can the mutual aid team be consolidated, and how can it affect the surrounding farmers to organize? At the same time, the mutual aid team must first do a good job in agricultural production, good planting and more harvesting. The surplus labor force should first be used for land processing, such as improving farming methods, improving soil, repairing canals, building dams, increasing irrigated land, planting fruit trees, and afforestation. There are many such things. Second, according to local conditions, engage in various sideline occupations such as herding sheep, raising pigs, watching livestock, hitting mountain goods, engaging in handicrafts, and even driving cars and carrying feet, and combine them with agricultural production. However, mutual aid teams should not engage in commerce, and are not allowed to engage in hired labor exploitation (it is permissible to hire short-term workers and technicians when necessary), to prevent the growth of capitalist elements.

4. In order to expand production needs, it is permissible to equip some farm tools and livestock as public property in the mutual aid team, but it should mainly be to add large farm tools or new farm tools or large livestock that individual farmers cannot afford. It is wrong for some mutual aid teams to depreciate all the general farm tools owned by each household and turn them over to the public. If there are problems with the use or calculation of work points of certain farmers' original livestock and carts, these problems should be reasonably resolved first, and do not easily buy them for public ownership. Whether it is a mutual aid team or an agricultural production cooperative, the income from production should first be "returned to private ownership," and its public property must be gradually accumulated after the "private property" has increased, and through the voluntariness of all members. Pursuing too much public property too early is harmful and useless.

5. In the new district, in principle, rich peasants should not be absorbed into mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives. For the rich peasant elements who have now joined the team or the cooperative, if they have joined with hired labor or are taking the opportunity to exploit the labor of others, they must be resolutely cleaned out; if they have not brought hired labor, and they do abide by the rules, and the calculation of labor exchange and compensation wages are still reasonable, and the masses are willing, and the leading backbone in the team or the cooperative is relatively strong, they may not be ordered to withdraw, but they must not hold leadership positions. In the old district, rich peasant elements who have been equally divided and no longer have hired labor exploitation, and who do abide by the rules, and who have been approved by the masses, may be allowed to join the mutual aid team, but they must not hold leadership positions either. No one in the mutual aid team or cooperative is allowed to bring hired labor to join the team or the cooperative. The mutual aid team or cooperative is also not allowed to hire long-term workers to cultivate or work.

6. Landlord elements are not allowed to join the mutual aid team until they have been approved by the masses to change their composition. As for rural self-reformed bandits, puppet soldiers, junior officers, puppet staff, puppet security chiefs, etc., if they were originally from working people, and are not subject to control, as well as general rogues and other vagrant elements, as long as they are willing to work and produce, they may be allowed to join the mutual aid team (but they cannot be leaders) with the consent of the masses, so as to help and supervise their labor reform.

7. The mutual aid team should accept the family members of martyrs and military personnel with weak labor force into the team, and actively help them to improve their living conditions by working and producing. As for the family members of martyrs and military personnel who lack labor force and need to be cultivated on their behalf, they should be handled in accordance with the methods prescribed by the People's Government; however, if the members of the mutual aid team and the family members of martyrs and military personnel are willing to solve the problem of cultivation on their behalf by participating in the mutual aid team, it is also permissible. This principle also applies to isolated and widowed households. In addition, small land leasers (or small land operators), if they have labor force to transfer to agricultural labor, may be allowed to join the mutual aid team; but if no one participates in agricultural labor and only contributes land, they cannot join. Within the mutual aid team, the labor force of women shall be assessed and scored according to their actual labor situation in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women. It is wrong for some places to calculate women's labor on a half-labor basis across the board.

8. Rural cadres should not demand any special rights in the mutual aid team. Communists and members of the Communist Youth League in rural areas should actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and become models of active labor, discipline, and fairness in them.

9. Mutual aid teams and supply and marketing cooperatives should be linked, and "combination contracts" can be adopted to ensure supply and sales according to the plan. In this way, the mutual aid team can obtain more planned assistance from the national economy through the cooperative, and can gradually combine its production with the national plan.

10. The existing state-owned farms should be rectified, and those that are poorly run should be thoroughly reformed immediately. Next year, each county must set up a state-owned farm as a demonstration. Each province needs to add farm tool factories and agricultural technology promotion stations. At present, in solving the problem of farm tools, we should first focus on a large number of replenishing locally used farm tools, and gradually promote new farm tools suitable for local conditions. In promoting agricultural technology, we must also adopt the policy of combining scientific guidance with mass experience.

11. Regarding rural education, we oppose not publicizing to the masses or rarely publicizing, and we also oppose only talking about socialism abstractly and vaguely without linking it to reality or explaining the current policies of the Party specifically. There are too many meetings in rural areas, and too many meetings that do not solve the actual problems of the masses, and this should be changed. We are preparing to universally carry out the literacy movement in the rural areas of the Northwest next year or the year after, and hope to succeed in several years, so that the vast number of farmers can improve their cultural level.

Finally, let's talk about leadership. To run a mutual aid team well, first, there must be a strong and correct core, and second, there must be regular political work, that is, the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League must go in to work. Is it okay to leave the leadership of the Party? No, in that case, the mutual aid team will change, go down the wrong road, and even disintegrate. If the Party does not take control of the leadership, rich peasants, landlords, and bad elements will run in to sabotage. The Party must do these two things well: one is to constantly pay attention to discovering active elements in various mutual aid and cooperation organizations, cultivate them as backbones, and absorb some of the outstanding people among them as members of the Communist Youth League and Communist Party. One is to implement specific guidance on the mutual aid and cooperation movement in various places, constantly go deep into the masses, understand the problems and help them solve the problems. It is not enough to just sit in the office and point fingers. Holding meetings of mutual aid team representatives is also a way to train cadres and guide the movement. Each county must hold one or two such meetings every year, and each district and township should hold one every season to summarize experience and study problems. There is also an important method, which is to seize typical examples and promote them. Above, we stipulate that each local party committee and each county party committee must personally guide one or two mutual aid teams, which is what it means.

After the land reform, developing agricultural production has become the overriding work in rural areas. Is there any work greater than developing agricultural production? No. Organizing mutual aid and cooperation is the central link in developing agricultural production. Is this the case? We are currently launching a warm patriotic high-yield movement through mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Many tasks can be done well through this patriotic high-yield and mutual aid and cooperation movement, and a series of problems in rural work will also be solved through this movement. For example, can the problem of building a rural regime of the people's democratic dictatorship be separated from the matter of production and farmers' mutual aid and cooperation? Separated from production and mutual aid and cooperation, which are the things most closely related to the masses, what is the content of so-called building democratic politics? It is very clear that all rural work must revolve around developing agricultural production and developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement. All of our work must adapt to this new situation and make itself suitable for this new task. Comrades who do rural work must learn to organize the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and comrades who do economic work and other work such as culture and education must also learn this knowledge and work diligently among the masses. Chairman Mao had a passage saying "We Communists, no matter what issue, must be able to combine with the masses. If our party members sit in the house all their lives and do not go out, do not experience wind and rain, and do not see the world, what good is such a party member to the Chinese people? There is no good at all, we do not need such people to be party members. Our Communists should experience wind and rain and see the world. This wind and rain is the great wind and rain of the mass struggle, and this world is the great world of the mass struggle." ("Get Organized!") Now the literary and artistic comrades in Xi'an are carrying out rectification. Why have some of our writers not been able to write anything for a long time? It is because he locked himself in the house and "did not see the world." Separated from the mass struggle and the actual life of the masses, where will there be any "sense of fresh things," and where will he be able to write good works? I think everyone should read carefully the passage by Chairman Mao mentioned above. All comrades in the Party should always remember this point.

Our meeting is about to end. Around the autumn harvest this year, each province, each special zone, and each county must hold a meeting dedicated to discussing agricultural mutual aid and cooperation work, draw up a plan and method for carrying out this movement locally, and mobilize the whole party to implement it.

    关于西北地区农业互助合作运动
    ——一九五二年六月六日在中共中央西北局农业互助合作工作会议上的总结报告
    习仲勋
    这个会议开的很合时，很必要。农村生产互助合作运动是土地改革以后最大的事情，大家讲的很多，我只讲几个问题。一
    西北地区关内四省土地改革基本完成了。新疆去年冬天起普遍进行了减租，今年秋后也要实行土地改革。解放以来农民不断提高起来的生产积极性，在土地改革之后，越发提高了。农民的生产积极性同时也表现在劳动互助和生产合作方面。今年西北地区农业劳动互助组织发展很大。据手头不完全的统计，西北五省一市已经有六十二万多个互助组（只是二一三个县的统计，其中有农业生产合作社一百二十九个），有六百多万劳动力组织到互助组来。陕西省关中地区组织起来的劳动力占所有劳动力的百分之四十五左右；个别地方，像高陵县，几乎百分之八十的劳动力都组织到互助组来了。甘肃、宁夏两省一般也是如此。青海省多些，一般在百分之八十左右。新区农村的劳动互助运动，主要是去年和今年发展起来的。今年发展更大，各省比去年都发展一倍以上。
    这个趋势是很自然的。土地改革解决了农民生产的主要条件，即土地和一部分主要的生产资料，但是并未解决了农民所有的生产问题。这里有一个材料，长安县高家湾村调查，全村一六七户农民，土地改革后，八户雇农还全无牲口；一○七户贫农只有三六户有牲口，还有七一户没有牲口；五二户中农也有五户缺少牲口。大车、水车都很缺，雇农两样都没有；贫农一○七户只有两辆大车、三辆水车；中农也是五二户才有四辆大车、四辆小车、六辆水车。其他农具，贫农还缺的不少，中农也有缺的，雇农缺的更多。很明白，组织互助来解决生产困难已经成为农民的迫切需要了。
    再举一些材料。陕西省白水县魏家村高三进互助组八个人，九天时间锄了一九四点六亩麦田，平均每人每天锄二亩七，同村未组织起来的十六个人，十天只锄了一七四亩，每人每天只锄一亩一，互助组的劳动效率一个人就顶两个多人。朝邑县三区五乡三千多亩棉田去年种十一天，今年组织起九十六个互助组，四天半就种完了。淳化县高家村赵建台等九个互助组，组织起来余出一部劳动力搞副业生产，两个月赚得十二石粮食。许多地方打水井、修水渠都因为组织了互助组，很快便成功了。还有使用新式农具和药械，也都是组织起来好办。也很明白，组织起来利于农业生产迅速发展，并使之不断提高，逐渐摆脱落后状态。
    农村互助合作运动这个大发展，又是农民群众对党和人民政府高度信任的结果。农民们一听说是毛主席号召他们组织起来，都积极响应，“毛主席的话没错”。农民群众是充分相信党的领导的。但是，我们许多党的组织和干部，在领导农民中间，在领导农村这个劳动互助和生产合作运动中间，却存在很大的盲目性。这个盲目性对农民群众的积极性，对农村互助合作运动，都有很大的损害，并且将会严重地损害党的威信。
    这个盲目性表现在运动的混乱状态。自流现象仍然是不少的。“好搭好，赖搭赖”，“拉撒合拉撒”，这也是自流现象。许多互助组还缺少领导，发生问题没人解决，一些互助组甚至被富农以至地主分子把持。我们已经组织起来的这六十万个互助组并不都是牢靠的。其中有不少是形式的，凑数的，“硬编组”，“抄单单”，一个命令，一个村里一个早上就搞起十几个互助组，“出门是互助组，到地里都不见互助组了”。有些互助组确实组织在一起劳动了，但是，一不计工，二不算账，“吃亏的吃亏、便宜的便宜”，总之问题很多。
    现在已经到了必须改变这些混乱现象，消除运动的盲目状态的时候了。
    土地改革后，我们在农村，一方面应当继续帮助农民个体经济的发展，一方面又必须坚决引导农民经济经过劳动互助和生产合作逐步走向集体化。这是我们党确定的方针。毛主席在一九四三年一篇题目叫做“组织起来”的讲话里就说过：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位。这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化，而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社”。他在同年另一次题目叫做“论合作社”的讲话里并说：“如果不从个体劳动转移到集体劳动的生产方式的改革，则生产力还不能获得进一步的发展。因此，建设在以个体经济为基础（不破坏个体的私有财产基础）的劳动互助组织，即农民的农业生产合作社，就是非常需要了。只有这样，生产力才可以大大提高”。他说“这样的改革……就是生产制度上的革命”。他把这个改革叫做破坏了封建剥削关系之后的“第二个革命”。共同纲领也在第三十四条上规定了“在一切已彻底实现土地改革的地区，人民政府应组织农民及一切可以从事农业的劳动力以发展农业生产及其副业为中心任务，并应引导农民逐步地按照自愿和互利的原则，组织各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作。”毛主席这些指示和共同纲领这个规定都是说得十分明白的。
    解放后三年，农村变化很大，经过土地改革，农村经济更是从根本上起了变化。再举上面举过的长安县高家湾村调查材料看，那里是去年春上才完成土地改革的，今年一○七户贫农中间有一○四户经济都上升了，只有三户因为是孤老或者有人害病未曾上升。土地改革才过了一年，贫农内有百分之三十现在都上升成中农了。估计今年两季庄稼都收了后，贫农的总收入将比去年增加百分之二十到二十五，比土地改革前增加百分之四十。相当多的贫农将有力量在今年夏收或秋收后买牲口和添置农具。还有好几个调查材料，所说情况也大致相仿。到高家湾调查的同志估计，今年秋后，贫农上升做中农的将要达到百分之七、八十。这个估计可能太高。大致像陕西关中地区，即完成土地改革有一年以上的地区，再有两三年，其他今年刚完成土地改革的地区再有三五年，中农要变成农村人口的大多数，这点倒是可以预见的。但是，如果我们不去加以领导，任由农民经济自发地发展下去，那么还会有另外的情况，就是农村阶级重新分化，少数人变做富农，而大多数人又再行破产，农业生产依旧长期停在落后状态下，很难提高，农村经济发展十分迟缓而且痛苦。新民主主义国家里，富农经济虽然可以允许保存，但是它绝不是我们农民经济的发展方向，而且是要受到限制的。这当然不是说我们是什么“许穷不许富”，我们正是要求所有农民都富裕起来，比富农更富裕，即采取集体劳动办法赛过富农。土地改革后，农民中间一定程度的阶级分化也固然还不可以完全避免，但是，只要采取组织农民互助合作办法，加上国家经济上和技术上帮助，大多数农民就可能保持中农的地位，避免重新破产，而且一天天富裕起来。事情就是这样。
    把农民组织起来实行劳动互助和生产合作或者任其自流发展，乃是两条道路的问题。斯大林同志在“论列宁主义底几个问题”那本书上说：“在我们国家里，农民经济可能而且应当按什么道路发展呢？农民经济并不是资本主义经济。农民经济按绝大多数农户来说是小商品经济。而小商品农民经济又是什么呢？它是站在资本主义与社会主义间的十字路口的经济。它既可能发展到资本主义方面去，如现在资本主义国家里的情形那样，也可能发展到社会主义方面去，如在我们国家里，在无产阶级专政条件下所要发生的情形一样”。他又在“论列宁主义基础”一书上说：“列宁在他论合作制的论文中正确指示说：我们俄国的农业应当按新道路去发展，即经过合作社吸收多数农民来参加社会主义建设的道路，将集体制原则逐渐灌输于农业，起初灌输于农产品销售方面，然后灌输于农产品生产方面的道路去发展”。发展农村劳动互助和生产合作，就是“将集体制原则逐渐灌输于农业”的一个重要办法（另一个办法即发展供销合作社，我们准备以后再讨论它），前途是农业经济集体化，是社会主义。如果任由农民经济自流发展，前途则是资本主义，对于大多数农民和国家人民又是苦难重重。后者就是放弃工人阶级领导，是右的倾向。在农业互助合作运动上的自流现象，其错误就在这里。
    毛主席在“论人民民主专政”的文章里说，“严重的问题是教育农民。农民的经济是分散的，根据苏联的经验，需要很长的时间和细心的工作，才能做到农业社会化。”列宁在“论合作制”一文里也说过：
    “但是为要经过新经济政策来做到使全体农民个个都参加合作社——这就需要一个较长的历史时代。在最好的情况下，我们也要花一二十年的功夫，才能来通过这一历史时代。”那些不愿花“功夫”，不愿做
    “细心的工作”，不准备通过“较长的时间”，不准备“逐步地”去“吸引”农民参加集体化的人，是不了解农民的，必然脱离农民群众。群众哪里可以去命令的呢？农民们说：“秋后看”，要看事实，要经过他们自己切身的经验。很明白，对于农民，只能“逐步”“吸引”，这里我也暂且不去说到其他条件等等了。劳动互助和生产合作，无论如何终归是由个体走向集体的一种过渡形式。这就是说，它们都是“以个体经济为基础”，是“不破坏个体的私有财产基础”的。离开个体经济基础，它们也就不可能吸引农民过到集体化去。不照顾个体经济，过高过急地去要求农民，甚至粗暴地侵犯农民个体利益，当然是错误的。
    以上就是西北地区目前农业互助合作运动的基本情况。二
    今后计划呢？根据我们的实际情况和经验，今后要求如何？采取什么方针呢？
    按比较恰当的估算，去年，一九五一年，我们西北全区农业生产总值，大约比解放前增加十分之一左右。我们要求，今后四、五年内，争取全区农业生产总值比现在再增加二分之一左右。条件较好的地区，例如陕西关中等地区，还争取更高些。在现有条件下，这个要求大体是恰当的。到明年，西北五省农业地区就都要完成土地改革了。土地改革后，我们无疑地必须将农村的全部工作集中到发展农业生产和农村副业上面。西北地区目前的农业生产状况还是很落后的，某些条件短期内还难有大的改变，这点又规定了只有首先依靠我们努力去充分发动农民群众的生产积极性和组织起来的力量，再加上其他必要的和可能的帮助，使农村现有的生产能力尽可能地发挥起来，并逐渐改善自身条件，继续提高。只要确实把我们农村工作的全副精力来尽这样的努力，四、五年内使西北农业生产水平在大体上提高半倍，却是可能的。
    在农业互助合作方面，我们计划，今后首先在两三年内，争取一般农业地区都有百分之六十到七十的劳动力确实地组织起来；在互助组中，常年互助组争取占到百分之二十左右；每县都试办一个到两三个农业生产合作社，期望依据这个基础，到五年后做到有一半以上农户组织在常年互助组内，每个乡都有一个农业生产合作社。按照经验，这个要求也大体是恰当的。
    目前我们组织起来的六十万个互助组，百分之八、九十都是小型的、临时性的、简单的劳动互助组，即一般叫做“变工”或“换工”之类。这是一种最初级的形式，但是适合农民原有的互助习惯，结合方便，也适应农民当前迫切需要，可以解决劳力或牲口或农具不够的困难，可以应急赶时耕种、锄草、打虫或收割等等，也可以余出一些劳动力去从事其他生产，已经大见好处，因此容易被最大多数的农民接受，便利大量发展。看不起这种互助组是不对的。在今后两三年内，我们仍然必须首先积极地、大量地在所有农村推广这种互助组；并且不怕麻烦、不怕反复地每年、每季都用很大的力量去进行工作，帮助它们解决各种困难。如果普及地、确实地而不是形式地在两三年内做到有百分之六十的农户都组织到这种互助组来，就给我们农业互助合作运动继续前进打好了基础。
    常年互助组在陕北老区已经占到所有互助组中百分之三、四十。劳动互助运动有了一些基础，简单的变工不能满足农民继续提高生产的要求，这种互助组就必然也必要逐步发展。它比一般临时的和季节性的简单变工，好处更大，可以进一步和提高技术以及经营某些副业结合，可以置用某些单个农户置不起或用不了的新式农具或大牲口，可以办到某些农户办不到的事情，例如打坝、修渠等等。经过这种较定型的互助组，就得把农民群众集体劳动习惯逐渐巩固起来。目前这种互助组，在陕西多些，
    一般约占互助组数百分之十到二十，但是还不稳固；其他各省都很少。四、五年后，它应当成为互助组中的多数，否则不能适应农村生产发展。但是，两三年内，它在一般新解放区还以稳步发展为宜。因为它内容较丰富，组织性较大，所以问题也较复杂、较多，它的成立和巩固，需要经过不断解决内部许多问题，并需要其中有一定的核心分子，要短时间内发展很多是不可能的。这种互助组仍然不宜太大，一般地以小型为好。其内容有较简单的和较复杂的，也一般地应当由简渐繁。长安县王蟒村互助联组是一个新发展，目前还只宜试办。各地领导机关目前应当着重研究这种互助组的经验，密切帮助巩固已有的，带动其他。各地委、县委都要亲自指导一两个这种互助组，深入地、有系统地进行研究。
    至于农业生产合作社，则一个时期还应当控制在试办范围内。这种农业生产合作社无疑地是将来由小农经济过渡到社会主义集体农庄的基本形式。若干年后，它也无疑地将是那时农业互助合作运动的主要形式。我们必须看见这点。必须作此准备。但是，发展这种农业生产合作社需要有一定的条件：
    “群众在生产中的需要，互助运动的基础、领导的骨干、群众的积极性、并有充分的酝酿等。”而且，要普遍推广还需要一定相适应的其他经济上、技术上的条件。我们应当准备用三、五年的时间有领导地、依据条件有计划地加以试办。最好今年和明年各省委、各地委先直接试办一两处，然后指导各县都来试办。西北地区今年办起一二九个农业生产合作社，少数是有某些基础的，或有计划试办的，大多数则是盲目办起，缺少必要的基础和条件，没有领导的。米脂县一个县今年一个春天就“发展”六十三个社，子洲县也是一个县一办便是二十三个。这是盲目追求多，还有盲目追求大。这一百多个农业生产合作社，即应分别整顿。有相当基础和条件的，列入试办计划内，加强领导，确实办好。无基础、无条件、勉强办起又无力领导的，说服群众改成其他互助组。
    我们今后的计划、步骤、方针就是如此。
    现在我们就着手首先把现有各种互助合作组织加以整顿，在今年种麦、秋收中努力帮助它们办好。这是给今后运动前进取得可靠阵地，不可松懈。
    依据可能条件、依据可靠阵地、有准备地、有领导地稳步前进，才是正确的。三
    在组织互助合作中，还有以下一些问题需要解决。
    一、组织互助合作，必须坚决巩固贫农、雇农和中农以及农村中一切劳动人民紧密团结。在互助组内，不得排挤贫农、雇农，也不得压抑中农，应当切实帮助贫农、雇农解决各种生产困难，同时必须坚决保护中农利益。对互助组外的个体农民，不得歧视，更不得打击，应当教育互助组主动地去团结他们。分得了土地的贫农、雇农，无疑地是互助合作运动的最积极的部分。但是，在土地改革以后，中农将逐渐成为农村人口的大多数，坚持团结中农，无论何时都是我们党在考虑农村政策上最重要的一点。
    二、不计工算账，不能保证农民间互利。畜工和人工交换比例以及使用其他牲口、农具的报酬，在目前许多地方缺少牲口、农具的情况下，不可定的低了，伤害农民照管和添置牲口、农具的积极性，也不可提的过高，使贫农、雇农吃亏。计算办法要适合当地农民习惯，简便易行，不要太烦太杂，列宁说过：“高明办法要尽量少些，巧妙办法要尽可能稀罕”。
    三、互助组一定要首先搞好生产，收入比一般农户多。是否做到这点，是检查互助组工作好坏的标准。如果不是这样，如何能够把互助组巩固下来，又如何能够影响周围农民都组织起来呢？同时，互助组又一定要首先搞好农业生产，好种多收。长余的劳动力，第一，用到土地加工上，如改进农作法，改良土壤以及修渠、打坝、增加水地和种果树、造林等等，这些事情是很多的。第二，按当地条件，进行拦羊、养猪、看牲口、打山货、搞手工业以至赶车、赶脚等各种副业，和农业生产结合起来，但是，互助组不要经营商业，不许进行雇佣劳动剥削（必要时雇短工和技术人员则是可以的），防止资本主义成分滋长。
    四、为了扩大生产需要，在互助组内，置备一些农具和牲口作为公共财产，是可以的，但主要应当是添置一些单个农户办不起的大型农具或新式农具或大的牲口。有些互助组把各家自有的一般农具都去折价归公，则是不对的。某些农户原有的牲口、大车等，如果使用上或计工上有问题，应当先去合理解决这些问题，也不要轻易地收买做公有。不论互助组和农业生产合作社，生产所得应当首先“归私”，其公共财产必须在增加了“私人财产”之后，经过全体成员的自愿，逐渐地积聚起来。过早地追求过多的公共财产，有害无益。
    五、在新区，原则上不应当吸收富农加入互助组或农业生产合作社。对现在已经入组入社的富农分子，如果是带雇工加入或者借机取巧进行剥削他人劳动的，必须坚决清洗出去；如果并未带雇工，而且确实守规矩，计算换工和找补工资都还合理，群众也愿意，组内社内领导骨干又较坚强，也可不令其退出，但不得担任领导职务。在老区中经过平分土地而现在已经不再有雇工剥削的富农分子，也确实守规矩，经过群众同意，可以允许他加入互助组，但同样不得担任领导职务。互助组和合作社内任何人都不允许带雇工入组入社。互助组或合作社也不允许雇长工耕种或做工。
    六、地主分子在未经群众同意改变成份时，一律不许加入互助组。至于农村中自新土匪、伪军士兵、下级军官、伪职员、伪保长等，如果原是劳动人民出身，又不是管制对象，以及一般流氓和其他游民分子，只要他们愿意劳动生产，经过群众同意，可以允许他们加入互助组（但是不能当领导人），以便帮助和监督他们劳动改造。
    七、对劳动力较弱的烈士家属和军人家属，互助组应当接收他们入组，积极帮助他们劳动生产改善生活条件。至于缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属要代耕的，则按照人民政府规定的办法办理；但是如果互助组的成员和烈属、军属双方都愿意用参加互助组的办法解决代耕问题，也是可以的。对孤、寡家户，也适用这个原则。此外，小土地出租者（或小土地经营者），如果有劳动力转入农业劳动的，可以允许他们加入互助组；但是如果无人参加农业劳动只出土地的，则不能加入。互助组内，对妇女劳动力，依据男女同工同酬原则，按其实际劳动情况，评工记分。有些地方把妇女一律按半劳动力计工，是不对的。
    八、乡村干部在互助组内不应当要求任何特殊权利。农村中共产党员和青年团员应当积极参加互助合作组织，并成为其中积极劳动、遵守纪律、办事公道的模范。
    九、互助组和供销合作社应当联系起来，可以采取订立“结合合同”办法，互相保证按计划进行供应和推销。这样，互助组可以经过合作社取得国家经济更有计划的帮助，并可以逐渐使自己的生产和国家计划相结合。
    十、现有国营农场应当进行整顿，办得很坏的立即彻底改造。明年每县都要办起一个国营农场，作为示范。各省需要增设农具工厂和农业技术推广站。目前在解决农具问题上应当先以大量地增补当地通用的农具为主，逐步地推广适合当地条件的新式农具。在推广农业技术上，也必须采取科学指导和群众经验相结合的方针。
    十一、关于农村教育方面，反对不向群众宣传或很少宣传，也反对只是抽象地、空洞地讲社会主义而不和实际联系、不具体解释党的目前政策。农村里开会太多，不解决群众实际问题的会议太多，应当改变。我们准备明年或后年，在西北农村中普遍开展识字运动，并期在若干年内获得成功，使广大农民得以提高文化水平。
    最后讲到领导问题。一个互助组要办好，第一要有一个有力的、正确的核心，第二要有经常的政治工作，就是说，要有共产党和青年团进去工作。离开党的领导行不行呢？不行的，那样互助组要起变化，走错路，以至瓦解。如果党不去掌握领导，富农、地主和坏分子就要跑进去捣鬼的。党必须办好这样两件事：一件是在各个互助合作组织内，不断地注意发现积极分子，加以培养，作为骨干，并把他们中间一些优秀人物吸收做青年团员和共产党员。一件是对各地互助合作运动实行具体指导，经常深入群众中间，了解问题并帮助他们解决问题，只坐在机关指手划脚是不成的。开互助组代表会议，也是训练干部、指导运动的一个办法，各县每年都要开一两次这样的会议，各区各乡最好每个季节都开一次，总结经验，研究问题。还有一个重要办法，叫做抓住典型、推广开去。上面我们规定各地委、各县委都要亲自指导一两个互助组，就是这个意思。
    在土地改革以后，发展农业生产便成了农村中压倒一切的工作了。还有比发展农业生产更大的工作么？没有了。组织互助合作又是发展农业生产的中心环节。是不是这样呢？我们目前正在通过互助合作组织来发动一个热烈的爱国丰产运动。许多工作都可以通过这个爱国丰产和互助合作的运动去办好，农村工作中一系列的问题也将通过这个运动去解决。例如建设人民民主专政的乡村政权问题，可不可以离开生产和农民的互助合作这件事情呢？离开生产和互助合作这样和群众关系最大的事情，所谓建设民主政治又有什么内容呢？很明白，农村的一切工作都要围绕发展农业生产、发展互助合作运动进行。我们各项工作都要按照这个新情况，使自己变得适合于这个新任务。做农村工作的同志都要学会组织互助合作运动，做经济工作的同志以及其他像文化、教育等等工作的同志也都要去学习这门知识，并且到群众中间认真地工作起来。毛主席有一段话，说“我们共产党员，无论在什么问题上，一定要能够同群众相结合。如果我们的党员，一生一世坐在房子里不出去，不经风雨，不见世面，这种党员，对于中国人民究竟有什么好处没有呢？一点好处也没有的，我们不需要这样的人做党员。我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面，这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”（“组织起来”）现在在西安的文艺工作同志们正在进行整风。为什么我们有些作家很久写不出东西来呢？就是因为他把自己关在房子里，“不见世面”。和群众斗争和群众的实际生活隔离了，哪里会有什么“新鲜事物的感觉”，哪里会写得出好作品来呢？我想，大家应当好好读一读上面举的毛主席那一段话。全党同志都应当时刻记住这一点。
    我们这个会议现在要结束了。今年秋收前后，各省、各专区和各县都要召开一次这样专门讨论农业互助合作工作的会议，拟出当地开展这项运动的计划和办法，并动员全党加以贯彻。
