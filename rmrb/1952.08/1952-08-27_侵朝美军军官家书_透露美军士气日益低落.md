Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 26th: Under the powerful blows of the mighty Korean and Chinese People's Army, the morale of the American invading army is declining more and more. Several letters home from a U.S. military officer invading Korea, published in the August 8th issue of "U.S. News & World Report," vividly illustrate this point.

This American officer, fighting in the "forgotten war" in Korea without knowing why, revealed in his letters how afraid the U.S. troops were of being driven to attack the Korean and Chinese People's Army. In a letter from the Eighth Army rear area, he said: "Every time the telephone rings at night, we get chills, fearing that we might have to counterattack. We never know if we are really going to counterattack until we get close to the front line."

This American officer admitted that the Korean and Chinese People's Army was exceptionally strong, and U.S. casualties were heavy. In a letter from the combat training area, he said:

"Today I heard that two regiments on the front line are currently taking eight thousand shells a day from the Communists. Last week, a battalion advanced its position, resulting in about one hundred and fifty dead and wounded, and the loss of several tanks. If we attempt to break through the Chinese army's position head-on, then these deaths and injuries are just an indication of the casualties we may suffer." In a letter from the front line, he said: "In this area, the Chinese have more artillery than we do, and it's better than ours. Our battalion has suffered about thirty-five dead and wounded in three days. Every time our tank commander fires his 90mm cannon, the Chinese respond with 120mm cannon shells."

Faced with such a powerful Korean and Chinese People's Army, U.S. soldiers are not only afraid to attack but also tremble in fear of being attacked themselves. This officer described the situation where U.S. soldiers are startled by the slightest sound: "We lose about a hundred grenades every night—the guys just throw grenades at anything that makes a noise." This American officer, afraid of being killed, came up with the "most effective way" to deal with attacks from the Korean and Chinese side. He said: "Fortunately, our bunkers are very good, so if I am attacked and there is a serious breakthrough, I can order the men into the bunkers and notify the artillery to fire on our own positions."

These letters also revealed that the U.S. troops "are beginning to feel a lack of ammunition," and due to insufficient manpower, there are many "gaps" in the main line of U.S. defense. These "gaps" have become active areas for scouts from the Korean and Chinese side.

The American invaders are now clamoring every day to exert so-called "military pressure" on the Korean and Chinese side, and they are relying on such a bunch of good-for-nothings. It is clear that their "military pressure" will have no other result than causing greater casualties to the U.S. troops and further lowering their morale.

### 侵朝美军军官家书  透露美军士气日益低落

    侵朝美军军官家书
    透露美军士气日益低落
    【新华社开城二十六日电】在强大的朝中人民军队的有力打击下，美国侵略军的士气是愈来愈低了。八月八日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”所刊载的一个侵朝美军军官的几封家信，淋漓尽致地说明了这一点。
    这个在朝鲜的“被遗忘了的战争”中不知为何而战的美国军官，在信中透露了美军是如何害怕被驱策去向朝中人民军队进攻。他在从第八军后备区发出的一封信里说：“夜间每当电话铃一响，我们就浑身发冷，因为害怕我们可能要去反攻。在我们逼近前线之前，我们永远不知道是不是真的要去反攻。”
    这个美国军官承认朝中人民军队异常强大，美军伤亡惨重。他在从战斗演习区发出的一封信里说：
    “今天我听说，前线目前有两个团每天要挨共军八千发炮弹。上星期，一个营向前推进了它的阵地，结果死伤了一百五十人左右，还损失了几辆坦克。如果我们企图正面突破中国军队的阵地的话，那末这些死伤只是我们所可能遭受的伤亡的一个征象而已。”在从前线发出的一封信里，他说：“在本区内，中国人的大炮比我们的多，比我们的好。我们这一营在三天内大约死伤了三十五人。每当我们的坦克指挥官发射他的九十公厘口径大炮时，中国人便回敬一百二十公厘口径大炮炮弹。”
    面对着这样强大的朝中人民军队，美军士兵不但害怕进攻，而且胆战心惊地惟恐自己受到攻击。这个军官描写美军士兵草木皆兵的情形说：“我们每夜损失百来个手榴弹——弟兄们直把手榴弹往有声音的地方掷去。”这个惟恐被打死的美国军官想出了
    一着对付朝中方面进攻的“最有效的办法”。他说：“很幸运，我们的地堡好得很，所以要是我受到了进攻和严重的突破时，我就可以命令弟兄们到地堡里去，并通知炮队向我们自己的阵地开火。”
    这些信还透露了美军“开始感到弹药的缺乏”，并且由于兵力不足之故，在美军的主要防线上存在着许多“缺口”，这些“缺口”已经成为朝中方面斥堠队的活跃场所。
    美国侵略者现在天天叫嚷着要对朝中方面施行所谓“军事压力”，而他们所依靠的就是这么一批货色。很显然，他们的“军事压力”除了使美军遭受更大的伤亡，士气更加低落而外，不可能有其他的结果。
