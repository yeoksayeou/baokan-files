Sports in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
丁芒

Why was Zhang Jihui, a hero of the Volunteer Army Air Force, able to shoot down enemy planes without being affected by air pressure and centrifugal force during continuous and intense aerial combat? Why was Wang Guozhang able to jump into water more than three meters deep three times in the sub-zero cold to retrieve timed bombs? Why was Wang Yuzeng, who was not yet twenty years old, able to capture an American prisoner of war from the enemy's lair who was twice his size? Why do such heroic deeds frequently occur on the front lines: when ammunition runs out and reinforcements are exhausted, and the enemy charges up the hill, our heroic soldiers are able to throw the enemy down the mountain with their bare hands? —In addition to their invincible heroism and extraordinary skills, a strong physique is an important condition for them to achieve heroic feats.

In order to build up their bodies to defeat the American aggressors, defend peace, and defend the motherland, sports are widely carried out in the Volunteer Army. Leaders and commanders at all levels attach great importance to this work, calling on commanders and fighters to actively participate in sports activities, and trying to purchase a large number of balls and other sports equipment for distribution to the troops. After a certain division entered Korea, it held three cultural and sports meetings one after another under very difficult conditions. Last winter, in order to prevent the soldiers' feet from being frostbitten, a certain division universally carried out skating activities, and the division commander, deputy division commander, chief of staff, etc. all participated personally. The rear troops even regard sports activities as a military subject. Qi Xiangyu, the regimental commander of a certain regiment, often personally trained the soldiers to play basketball. Under the call and leadership of leading cadres, sports activities in the Volunteer Army are flourishing.

With the goal of winning the war as the main goal, Volunteer Army soldiers have all chosen the focus of sports exercise according to their own combat and work needs. In order to exercise rapid marching, and to be able to rush to the top of the mountain and occupy the commanding heights in a few minutes, the infantry units practice climbing and rapid marching every morning with more than 60 pounds of full equipment. In order to make the transfer of gun positions faster, and to load more shells in one minute, the anti-aircraft artillery units practice tug-of-war and weightlifting day and night.

Heroic soldiers with high wisdom have come up with various ways to carry out battlefield sports activities under extremely difficult environmental and material conditions. Whether at the front or in the rear, even every squad has single bars, parallel bars and pommel horse equipment. These sports equipment are all made by the soldiers themselves. They cut wooden sticks into round sticks and set them on tree branches to make single bars. Cut off a section of tree trunk, install four legs, and make a pommel horse, or build a pommel horse with stones. They tie stones to both ends of a wooden stick and use it as a weightlifting device; or use the wheels of a small train in a mine instead of a thousand-jin load. The front-line troops installed these in concealed areas, and sometimes after a battle, they would come back and practice on the single bars. Many Volunteer Army companies have basketballs and volleyballs. The soldiers nailed wooden box boards from canned food from the motherland to tree trunks as backboards, and if there was no basket, they would collect scrap iron to make their own, or use vine-like branches to replace them. Many volleyball nets are made of straw ropes. In order to prevent enemy air raids, the court is camouflaged with branches, and in the evening, the soldiers happily run on the court. When marching, the soldiers often carry wheels and wooden sticks, climb mountains and cross ridges, and as soon as they arrive at a new駐地 [zhùdì - garrison or station], they immediately install them.

In the dense forests of North Korea, it is rare to find a flat place. The soldiers use their game time to collect stones, raise the low-lying areas, and make ball courts. The mountain streams are very rapid, and in order to practice swimming, they often have to carry dry food and walk thirty or forty miles to find a small river. Soldier Qu Guimin and others came up with a way: block the downstream of the mountain stream with stones, and then block the stone crevices with military raincloth, so that the water gradually accumulates and can be used for swimming.

Sports activities in the rear organs and troops of the Volunteer Army are even more common. Many units do morning exercises early in the morning. Practice armed marching and grenade throwing, etc. Each battalion often organizes ball game competitions with each other, and some troops often hold friendship matches with local Korean government agencies and people's organizations.

The combination of sports activities according to actual needs and heavy labor exercises has greatly enhanced the physical fitness of the Volunteer Army soldiers, which has played a great role in improving the combat effectiveness and labor efficiency of the troops. Initially, it took dozens of people to drag a cannon for a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, but now it has reduced two-thirds of the manpower; initially, one person could only carry ten mountain artillery shells, but now they can carry more than twice as many as before. The Su Shiying squad, which guarded the 399.8 highland, repelled two consecutive attacks by the enemy's two companies in half an hour with continuous and accurate grenade throwing, and each person threw more than one hundred grenades. In the Battle of Ma Lian Shan, one soldier threw 170 grenades in a row, creating the highest record. Gu Mingfu, a combat model of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, increased the number of shells loaded per minute by one-third after two or three months of physical training. The Third Battalion of a certain unit once fought with thirty enemy planes for a whole day, creating the brilliant record of shooting down five enemy planes and damaging six. No soldier felt tired after the battle. The work efficiency of the transport units has also been greatly improved due to the enhanced physical fitness. More than 600 staff members of a certain unit have not had a single patient in the two years since they entered Korea.

This time, the delegation of the Volunteer Army participating in the People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Sports Meeting participated in basketball, volleyball, football, 1,500 meters and men's and women's relay races, high jump, swimming, dressing race walking, obstacle course, single and parallel bars, tug-of-war, weightlifting, motorcycle, bicycle competitions and other events, and exchanged sports experience with various PLA units. In the future, sports activities in the Volunteer Army will be further developed. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国人民志愿军中的体育运动
    丁芒
    为什么志愿军空军英雄张积慧能够在空战的连续激烈运动中，丝毫不受气压和离心力的影响而终于击落了敌机？为什么王国章能够在零下十几度的严寒，三次跳下三米多深的水里，起出定时炸弹？为什么不到二十岁的王玉增能够从敌人的巢穴里捉回一个比他高大一倍的美国俘虏？为什么在前沿阵地上经常出现这样的英雄事迹：当弹尽援绝、敌人冲上山头时，我们英勇的战士们，能够赤手空拳地把敌人摔下山去？——除了他们无敌的英雄气概和非凡的技术外，坚强的体质是他们成就英雄事业的一个重要条件。
    为了锻炼身体，以战胜美国侵略者、保卫和平、保卫祖国，志愿军部队中普遍开展着体育运动。各级领导机关和首长们，都十分重视这一工作，号召指挥员战斗员积极参加体育活动，并设法购置了大批球类和其他运动器具分发到部队中去。某师入朝后，在十分艰难的环境下，前后还召开了三次文化体育运动大会。去年冬季，为了防止战士们脚被冻坏，某师普遍开展了溜冰运动，师长、副师长、参谋长等都亲自参加。后方部队更把体育活动作为军事课目，某团团长祁相玉常常亲自训练战士们打篮球。在领导干部的号召和带头倡导下，志愿军各部队体育活动蓬勃地开展着。
    以一切为了战争胜利为目标，志愿军战士们都根据本身战斗和工作上的需要，各自选定体育锻炼的重点。步兵部队为了锻炼急行军，为了能在几分钟内冲上山头占领制高点，他们便每天早晨背着六十多斤重的全副装备，练习爬山和急行军。高射炮部队为了使炮位的转移更加迅速，为了在一分钟内装填更多的炮弹，便日日夜夜练习拔河和举重。
    有着高度智慧的英雄战士们，在环境和物质条件极端困难的情况下，想出各种办法来开展战地体育活动。无论前线或后方，甚至每一个班都有单杠、双杠和木马的设备。这些运动器具都是战士们自己制造的。他们用木头削成圆棍，架在树杈上制成单杠。砍下一段树干，安上四条腿，制成木马，或者用石块砌成木马。他们在一根木棍的两头绑上石块，当作举重器；或者用矿坑里的小火车轮子代替千斤担。前线部队把这些安装在隐蔽部里，有时打完一仗，回来就练单杠。志愿军许多连队都有篮球和排球。战士们把从祖国装罐头来的木箱板钉在树干上当作球架板，没有篮圈便检废铁来自己打造，或者用类似藤条的树枝来代替。很多排球网是用草绳编成的。为了防备敌人空袭，球场都用树枝伪装着，一到傍晚，战士们便愉快地在球场上奔驰起来。行军时，战士们常常带着车轮和木棍，爬山越岭，一到新的驻地，便又马上装置起来。
    在北朝鲜的丛山密林里，很少能找到一块平坦的地方。战士们便利用游戏时间检石块，把低地垫高，做成球场。山涧水流很急，为要练习游泳，常常要背着干粮走三四十里路，才能找到小河。战士屈贵民等曾经想出了一个办法：在山溪的下游用石头堵住，再把军用雨布挡住石缝，这样，水便逐渐积聚起来，可以游泳了。
    志愿军后方机关、部队的体育活动更为普遍。许多单位一清早便做广播体操。练习武装行军和投弹等。各营常常互相组织球类比赛，有些部队还常和当地朝鲜政府机关、人民团体举行友谊比赛。
    结合实际需要的体育活动和繁重的劳动锻炼，使志愿军战士们的体质都大大增强，这对于提高部队的战斗力与劳动效率，起了莫大的作用。某高射炮部队最初拖一门炮要几十人，现在减少了三分之二的人力；山炮弹最初一人只能揹十个，现在能背比过去增加一倍多。守卫三九九·八高地的苏世英班，以连续的准确的投弹，在半小时内击退敌人两个连的连续攻击，每个人都投弹达一百多个。马连山战斗中有一位战士连续投弹达一百七十个，创造了最高纪录。某高射炮部队战斗模范顾明富，经过两三个月的体力锻练，每分钟的装弹数增加了三分之一。某部三营有一次曾与三十架敌机整整战斗了一天，创造了击落敌机五架，击伤六架的辉煌战绩，战斗后没有一个战士感到劳累。辎重部队的工作效率，也因体质增强而大大提高。某部六百多名工作人员，入朝两年来没有发生一个病员。
    这次，志愿军参加人民解放军“八一”体育运动大会的代表团，参加了篮球、排球、足球、一千五百米及男女接力赛跑、跳高、游泳、着装竞走、超越障碍、单双杠、拔河、举重、摩托车、自行车竞赛等项目，和解放军各部队交流体育经验。将来志愿军中的体育活动将会更进一步地开展。（新华社）
