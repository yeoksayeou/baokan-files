    Shanghai Workers and Masses Gradually Launch Accelerated Literacy Learning

    The work of promoting the accelerated literacy method in Shanghai is unfolding among the working masses. In March of this year, Shanghai held its first experimental class for workers using the accelerated literacy method. After eight weeks of study (a total of 253 hours and 30 minutes of actual class time), the students increased their vocabulary from an average of 193 characters to 1,932 characters. Everyone could write simple letters and read "Labor Daily" and "Worker" bi-monthly magazine, and some could even write articles of more than 1,000 characters. Based on the experience of this experimental class, the Shanghai Municipal Staff and Workers' Spare-time Education Committee launched a series of experimental work. On the one hand, it opened another experimental class and a cadre study class. At the same time, it launched experimental work in 36 state-owned factories that had completed democratic reforms and entered production reform. After gaining experience, it was promoted in the whole factory and in the second batch of factories, and then gradually expanded to all factories in the city.

    The attention and leadership of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and the Party Committees at all levels under the Municipal Party Committee, first ensured the smooth promotion of the accelerated literacy method. On May 20, when the first experimental class graduated, comrades such as Tan Zhenlin from the East China Bureau personally participated. Comrade Tan Zhenlin also made an important speech, pointing out that Shanghai should systematically and universally promote the accelerated literacy method, and eliminate illiteracy among Shanghai workers within one or two years. Party committees at all levels have given great concern and serious leadership to the promotion of the accelerated literacy method. Most of the state-owned factories in the first batch to experiment with the accelerated literacy method have established accelerated literacy method promotion committees headed by responsible comrades from the Party Committee. The Party Committee of the No. 3 Plant of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company announced at a general meeting of cadres: "The promotion of the accelerated literacy method is one of the labor competition projects, and the promotion of the accelerated literacy method should be completed as a political task." The third deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the China Textile Machinery Factory personally convened meetings, listened to reports, and participated in specific leadership work. The leadership and support of the Party Committee encouraged the teachers' enthusiasm for work and the students' enthusiasm for learning.

    The Shanghai working class's enhanced awareness and urgent demand for cultural emancipation is another important condition for ensuring the smooth promotion of the accelerated literacy method. Wang Shusen, a worker at the No. 2 State-owned Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory, was recently promoted to section chief at the East China Textile Administration Bureau. He requested to be transferred back to the factory to participate in accelerated literacy learning. He said, "The higher-ups promoted me to section chief in the Textile Administration Bureau. Among the 21 comrades working together, 19 are college students. They not only understand Chinese characters, but also can read foreign languages. As a section chief, I am illiterate, and I dare not stamp my seal on tens of millions of yuan of banknotes. It is impossible not to be literate." The accelerated literacy class of the Shanghai Railway Bureau Electrical Machinery Repair Factory held a "Literacy Red Flag Competition," dividing a large wooden board into sixty squares, each square containing fifty characters. Below the squares were the names of the students, and above were models of the five-star red flag flying over Tiananmen Square, and Mao Zedong's portrait, with the words: "See whose red flag is the first to be planted on Tiananmen Square." On the morning of the fourth day of the single-character assault, the red flags of workers Shen Genfa and Chen Zuheng had already risen from the third square of 150 characters to the thirteenth square of 650 characters. Shen Genfa said: "Before liberation, I suffered a lot because I was illiterate. After liberation, I wholeheartedly wanted to study. I worked hard and learned for several years, but only recognized about two hundred characters. Now I never thought that in only fifty hours, I would recognize three thousand two hundred characters. I am truly grateful to Comrade Qi Jianhua for creating this good method, and I am even more grateful to Chairman Mao for his good leadership." Su Fengying, a female worker in the same factory, still had to cook at home after learning characters every day. Thinking of the benefits of literacy, she gritted her teeth and quickly progressed from recognizing more than one hundred characters to five hundred and fifty characters.

    The work of promoting the accelerated literacy method among Shanghai workers is progressing smoothly. From the initial experimental situation, the teaching progress is normal and the effect is great. For example, the experimental classes of the No. 9 State-owned Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory and the No. 3 Plant of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company generally completed the teaching tasks of phonetic alphabet and pinyin within 18 to 20 hours. In the experimental classes of the 36 factories, although there are also some difficulties, such as the inconsistent dialects of the students, the differences in levels and acceptance ability, and the lack of teaching experience, as long as the basic spirit of the accelerated literacy method is correctly grasped, the mobilization work is done in a timely manner in light of the ideological situation, and the teaching policy of linking with reality and taking the mass line is implemented, these problems can be solved. It is worth noting that some teachers do not have a sufficient understanding of the basic spirit of the accelerated literacy method, which has led to impatience. They have not fully realized that the "speed" of the accelerated literacy method is built on the basis of the masses' increased political awareness and urgent need for learning. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously carry out in-depth mobilization in light of the actual ideological situation of the students, and further enlighten and encourage their initiative and enthusiasm. All ideas that proceed from subjectivity, act rashly, and are eager for quick success have become major obstacles to the promotion of the accelerated literacy method. This is what Shanghai factories urgently need to pay attention to in their current work of promoting the accelerated literacy method. (Tian Zhongluo)

### 上海工人群众逐步展开速成识字学习

    上海工人群众逐步展开速成识字学习
    上海推行速成识字法的工作，正在工人群众中展开。今年三月间，上海举办了第一个工人速成识字法实验班。经过八个星期的学习（实际上课时间共二百五十三个小时又三十分钟），学员从原来平均识字一百九十三个，增加到一千九百三十二个。大家都能写简单的信稿，阅读“劳动报”和“工人”半月刊，有的还能写出一千多字的文章。根据这个实验班的经验，上海市职工业余教育委员会展开了一系列的实验工作，一方面开办了另一个实验班和干部学习班，同时在三十六个已完成民主改革进入生产改革的国营工厂中展开实验工作，取得经验后，在全厂和第二批工厂中推行，再逐步扩大到全市各工厂。
    中共中央华东局、上海市委和市委以下各级党委的重视和领导，首先保证了速成识字法的顺利推行。五月二十日，第一个实验班结业时，华东局谭震林等同志亲自参加，谭震林同志并作了重要的讲话，指出上海应该有计划地普遍推行速成识字法，在一两年内扫除上海工人中的文盲。各级党委对速成识字法的推行都给以极大的关怀和认真的领导。第一批实验速成识字法的国营工厂，大都成立了以党委负责同志为首的速成识字法推行委员会，上海钢铁公司第三厂的党委在全厂干部大会上宣布：“速成识字法的推行，是劳动竞赛项目之一，要把推行速成识字法作为一个政治任务来完成。”中国纺织机器厂党委第三副书记亲自召集会议，听取汇报，参加具体领导工作。党委的领导和支持，鼓舞了教师的工作热忱和学员的学习情绪。
    上海工人阶级觉悟的提高和要求文化翻身的迫切，是保证速成识字法顺利推行的另一个重要条件。国营上海第二棉纺织厂工人王树森，最近被提升到华东纺织管理局当科长，他要求调回厂参加速成识字的学习。他说：“上级提拔我到纺织管理局当科长，在一起工作的二十一位同志中，有十九位是大学生，他们不但懂中国字，还会看外国文。我当了科长不识字，几千万元的票子要我盖章，我不敢盖上去。不识字到底不行。”上海铁路局电机修制工厂的速成识字班办了一个“识字红旗竞赛”，在大木板上划成六十个格子，每格五十个字，格子下面是学员的名字，上面是天安门上飘着五星红旗的模型，和红旗并立的是毛主席的画像，上面写着：“看谁的红旗先插到天安门上”。突击单字的第四天早上，工人沈根发和陈祖衡的红旗已经从一百五十个字的第三格升到六百五十个字的第十三格了。沈根发说：“解放以前，因为自己不识字，吃尽了苦头。解放以后，我一心一意想读书，我拼命地啃，学了好几年，只识了二百来个字。现在想不到只有五十小时，我就认识了三千二百个字。我真感谢祁建华同志创造了这个好办法，我更感谢毛主席领导得好。”同厂女工苏凤英每天识了字回家还要烧饭。她想起识字的好处，咬了咬牙，很快就从认识一百多字进展到五百五十个字。
    在上海工人中推行速成识字法的工作，正在顺利地进行中。从初步的实验情况看来，教学的进度是正常的，效果也很大。如国营上海第九棉纺织厂、上海钢铁公司第三厂的实验班，一般都在十八小时到二十小时内完成了注音字母和拼音的教学任务。在三十六个厂的实验班里，虽然也存在着某些困难，如学员的方言口音不一致，水平和接受能力有差别，教学经验不丰富等等，但是只要正确地掌握速成识字法的基本精神，及时地针对思想情况做好动员工作，贯彻联系实际、走群众路线的教学方针，这些问题是可以解决的。值得注意的是部分教师对速成识字法的基本精神认识不足，因而产生了急躁的情绪。他们没有充分地认识到：速成识字法的“速”，是建筑在群众的政治觉悟提高、学习要求迫切的基础上的，因此必须不断地针对学员的实际思想情况，进行深入的动员，进一步启发和鼓励他们的积极性和主动性。凡是从主观出发，草率从事，急于求成的思想，都成了推行速成识字法的重大障碍。这是目前上海各工厂在推行速成识字法的工作中亟需注意的。（田钟洛）
