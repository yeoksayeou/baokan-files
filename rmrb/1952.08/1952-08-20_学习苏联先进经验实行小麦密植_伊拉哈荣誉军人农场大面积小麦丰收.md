    Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union and Implementing Close Planting of Wheat
    Large-Scale Wheat Harvest at the Yilahaha Veterans Farm

    This year, the Yilahaha Veterans Farm in Heilongjiang Province achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of wheat sown on a large area of 1,131 hectares (equivalent to 16,965 mu). The farm is now using combine harvesters and horse-drawn harvesters to concentrate all efforts on harvesting wheat.

    According to field investigations: the wheat on the farm is as high as 1.3 meters; an average of 388 ears grow per square meter; and each ear averages 26.6 grains. Based on this investigation, even after deducting losses in harvesting and threshing, the minimum yield per hectare can reach over 3,000 jin, exceeding the local farmers' normal annual yield (2,000 jin) by 50% and exceeding the farm's planned yield for this year (2,500 jin) by 20%.

    The reason for the bumper wheat harvest at the Veterans Farm is mainly due to learning from the advanced Soviet experience of close planting of wheat and implementing other advanced cultivation methods.

    1. Implementing close planting: All wheat at the Yilahaha Veterans Farm was sown using Soviet-style horse-drawn seeders and 24-row mechanical seeders. The row spacing is uniformly 15 centimeters. The sowing depth is 4 to 5 centimeters. Each row sows 75 fully germinated seeds per meter. 450 plants grow per square meter. The wheat sown by local farmers has a row spacing of 35 centimeters, and an average of 322 wheat ears grow per square meter, with an average of 21 grains per ear, and the grains are small and thin.

    2. Selecting superior varieties: All 1,100+ hectares of wheat in the farm are sown with the superior variety "Kewuhua" wheat. This type of wheat has a high yield and strong disease resistance. The seeds were all carefully selected using a Soviet-style wheat selection machine and disinfected with 0.3% copper sulfate. Wheat sown with such seeds is particularly strong. At the same time, because it was disinfected with copper sulfate, bunt disease was also eliminated.

    3. Implementing early sowing: In northern Manchuria, the earlier the spring wheat is sown, the better. Early planting can not only resist drought and preserve seedlings, but also mature early and avoid rust. This year, the Yilahaha Veterans Farm began sowing wheat as soon as the ground thawed, and all sowing was completed from April 7th to April 25th, ten days earlier than the sowing period of local farmers. This year, rust (stem rust) was relatively severe in the area. When rust occurred on the Veterans Farm wheat, it was already in the late milk stage, and the yield was only reduced by about 10%. The wheat sown by local farmers was sown later, and when rust occurred, it was mostly in the early milk stage, and some had just flowered, so they were severely affected and the yield was greatly reduced. The three years of experience in sowing wheat at the Veterans Farm show that early sowing does not contract rust disease, which has greatly educated local farmers.

    The above are several major experiences of the bumper wheat harvest at the Yilahaha Veterans Farm. However, there are still two important problems in cultivation at the Veterans Farm that should be resolved.

    1. It is necessary to implement a pasture-field crop rotation system. Last autumn, it rained for three consecutive months, and the Yilahaha Veterans Farm only plowed 300 hectares of land in total. When sowing wheat this spring, most of the wheat fields had to be plowed and sown immediately. At that time, the land had not completely thawed, and the initial plowing depth only reached 13 or 14 centimeters, and later reached 20 centimeters. If it is possible to deep plow to 25 centimeters in the autumn of the previous year, it can not only fully restore the soil fertility and completely eliminate weeds in the wheat fields, but also make the wheat sowing period earlier, thus further increasing wheat yield.

    From the perspective of the climate in northeastern North, after harvesting autumn crops such as soybeans and corn, the ground will soon freeze, making it difficult to fully implement autumn plowing. To solve this problem, it is only possible to learn from the advanced Soviet experience and implement a pasture-field crop rotation system. Implementing this cultivation system can improve soil structure, cultivate soil fertility, and increase the yield of various crops. The Yilahaha Veterans Farm has decided to implement an "eight-year pasture-field rotation system" starting next year, planning to make the average wheat yield reach at least 5,000 jin per hectare in five years, which will exceed the current normal annual yield of local farmers by 150%.

    2. This year, 2% of the wheat at the Yilahaha Veterans Farm suffered from loose smut. Disinfecting wheat seeds with copper sulfate can eliminate bunt, but it cannot prevent loose smut. The method to prevent loose smut is to soak the seeds in hot water. This year, the Yilahaha Veterans Farm sowed more than 1,100 hectares of wheat, using a total of more than 400,000 jin of seeds. It is very difficult to soak so many seeds in hot water. Under the condition of large-scale cultivation, to solve this problem, it is necessary to start by doing a good job in seed collection fields. If loose smut is eliminated in the seed collection fields, and the wheat harvested in the seed collection fields is used as the seeds for the next year, and the seeds in the seed collection fields are gradually expanded to the entire area, loose smut can be eliminated.

    This year, the wheat at the Yilahaha Veterans Farm has broken through the old level of yield in large-scale cultivation. However, this level is not very high. If we can well learn the Soviet Union's advanced cultivation techniques and cultivation systems, and ensure that 750 wheat ears grow per square meter, each ear produces 40 grains, and each thousand grains weigh 25 grams, then each square meter can harvest 1.5 jin of wheat, and one hectare can harvest 15,000 jin. Achieving this yield is not impossible. The Yilahaha Veterans Farm should strive to achieve higher yields in the future. (Ding Lushu)

### 学习苏联先进经验实行小麦密植  伊拉哈荣誉军人农场大面积小麦丰收

    学习苏联先进经验实行小麦密植
    伊拉哈荣誉军人农场大面积小麦丰收
    黑龙江省伊拉哈荣誉军人农场今年在一千一百三十一公顷（合一万六千九百六十五市亩）的大面积上播种的小麦，得到了全面的丰收。现农场正使用康拜因和马拉收割机，集中全力收割小麦。
    根据田间调查：该场的小麦高达一公尺三十公分；每一平方公尺平均成长三百八十八穗；每穗平均结籽二十六点六粒。根据这个调查，即使除去收割脱谷作业中的损失，每公顷最低产量还能达到三千斤以上，超过当地农民常年产量（二千斤）百分之五十，超过农场今年计划产量（二千五百斤）的百分之二十。
    荣誉军人农场小麦丰收的原因，主要是学习了苏联小麦密植的先进经验，并实行了其他先进的耕作方法。
    一、实行密植：伊拉哈荣誉军人农场全部小麦都是用苏联式马拉播种机和二十四行机械播种机播种的。行距一律是十五公分。播种深度为四公分到五公分。每一行每一公尺播种全部发芽的种子七十五粒。每一平方公尺生长四百五十株。当地农民播种的小麦，行距都是三十五公分，每平方公尺平均成长麦穗三百二十二个，每穗平均粒数二十一粒，而且粒子瘦小。
    二、选用优良品种：全场一千一百多公顷小麦，全部选用优良品种“克华”小麦。这种小麦产量高，抗病力强。种子都是用苏联式小麦精选机精选了的，又用千分之三的王铜消过毒。用这样的种子播种的小麦，株苗特别肥壮。同时因为用王铜消过毒，也消灭了腥黑穗病。
    三、实行早期播种：在北满种植春小麦，播种时间越早越好。种得早了不但可以抗旱保苗，还能早期成熟，免受锈病。今年伊拉哈荣誉军人农场的小麦在大地刚刚解冻时就开始播种，从四月七日到四月二十五日，全部播种完毕，比当地农民的播种期提前了十来天。今年当地锈病（杆锈病）比较严重，荣誉军人农场的小麦在发生锈病的时候，已至乳熟末期，仅减产百分之十左右。当地农民的小麦播种较晚，发生锈病时，大都在乳熟初期，有的刚刚扬花，因此受了严重的影响，减产甚多。荣誉军人农场三年播种小麦的经验，都是早期播种不染锈病，这给予当地农民很大的教育。
    以上是伊拉哈荣誉军人农场小麦丰收的几项主要经验。但是荣誉军人农场在耕作上还存在着下面两个重要问题，应该加以解决。
    一、必须实行牧草大田轮作制。去年秋天，一连下了三个月雨，伊拉哈荣誉军人农场一共只翻了三百公顷土地。今年春天小麦播种时，绝大部分麦田都要现翻现种，当时土地还没有完全解冻，最初翻地深度只达到十三、四公分，后来才达到二十公分。如果在头年秋季能够深耕二十五公分，不但可以充分恢复地力，彻底消灭麦田的杂草，而且可以使小麦播种期更加提前，这样就可以更加提高小麦产量。
    从东北北部的气候来看，大豆、玉米等秋季作物收割后，大地即将封冻，很难全部实行秋耕。为了解决这个问题，只有学习苏联先进经验，实行牧草大田轮作制。实行这种耕作制度，可以改良土壤组织，培养地力，提高各种作物的产量。伊拉哈荣誉军人农场已决定从明年开始实行“牧草大田八年轮作制”，计划在五年以后，使小麦平均产量最低达到每公顷五千斤以上，这样就可超过当地农民目前的常年产量的百分之一百五十。
    二、今年伊拉哈荣誉军人农场有百分之二的小麦发生了裸黑穗病。小麦种子用王铜消毒，可以消灭腥黑穗病，但是不能防治裸黑穗病。防治裸黑穗病的办法是实行温汤浸种。今年伊拉哈荣誉军人农场播种了一千一百多公顷小麦，共用种子四十多万斤，这么多种子实行温汤浸种，是很不容易的。在大面积耕种的情况之下，要解决这一问题，必须从作好采种田入手。如果在采种田中消灭了裸黑穗病，用采种田中收获的小麦作为明年的种子，渐渐地把采种田的种子扩大到全部面积上去，裸黑穗病便可消灭了。
    今年伊拉哈荣誉军人农场的小麦，已经突破了旧有的大面积耕种的产量水平。但是，这个水平还并不是很高的，如果能够很好地学习苏联的先进耕作技术和耕作制度，作到每平方公尺保证成长七百五十个麦穗，每穗生产四十个粒，每千粒重二十五克，则每一平方公尺，就能收获小麦一点五斤，一公顷就可以收获一万五千斤。达到这个产量并不是不可能的，伊拉哈荣誉军人农场今后应为达到更高的产量而奋斗。    （丁履枢）
