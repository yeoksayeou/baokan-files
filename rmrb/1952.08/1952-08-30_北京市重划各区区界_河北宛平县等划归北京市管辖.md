    Beijing Readjusts District Boundaries
    Wanping County, Hebei, etc., Placed Under Beijing's Jurisdiction

    [This newspaper reports] To strengthen district-level institutions in urban and suburban areas and to facilitate centralized leadership, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to expand the jurisdiction of districts and re-divide the boundaries of urban and suburban districts, effective September 1st. The new division is based on inner city, outer city, and suburban areas. The inner city is divided into: Dongdan District (mainly the original First District), Xidan District (mainly the original Second District), Dongsi District (mainly the original Third District), and Xisi District (mainly the original Fourth District). The outer city is divided into: Qianmen District (mainly the original Sixth District), Chongwen District (mainly the original Seventh District), and Xuanwu District (mainly the original Eighth District). The suburbs are divided into: Dongjiao District (mainly the original Tenth District), Nanyuan District (mainly the original Eleventh District), Fengtai District (mainly the original Twelfth District), Haidian District (mainly the original Thirteenth District), and Shijingshan District (mainly the original Fifteenth District). The district-level institutions of the original Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Districts are abolished, and their respective jurisdictions are merged into neighboring districts. In addition, in accordance with the needs of economic construction, the Mentougou area of Beijing and the mining areas west of it belonging to Hebei Province should be appropriately adjusted for unified management. The Beijing Municipal People's Government has reported this to the North China Administrative Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, and it has been decided to place the entire Wanping County of Hebei Province and parts of Fangshan and Liangxiang Counties under the jurisdiction of Beijing, merging them with the original Sixteenth District of Beijing to form the Jingxi Mining Area.
