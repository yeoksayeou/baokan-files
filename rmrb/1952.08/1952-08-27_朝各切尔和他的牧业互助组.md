	Chao Geqier and His Pastoral Mutual Aid Team

	In the vast grasslands of the Juwang Banner in the Ik Zhao League of Suiyuan Province, almost all herdsmen know the name of Chao Geqier, a model animal husbandman. Herdsmen often ride horses across dozens of miles of grassland to visit him, learning from him about grazing livestock and organizing pastoral mutual aid teams.

	Chao Geqier is the organizer of the first pastoral mutual aid team on the Ik Zhao League grasslands. In order to solve the difficulties of scattered management and lack of labor among herdsmen, he learned from the methods of agricultural mutual aid among the Han people and first organized twelve herding families. Over the past year, the mutual aid team has changed the backward "natural grazing" method to human-controlled grazing. Every family has built a pen, and several families have even built sheds and dug wells. The entire team has harvested more than 12,000 catties of grass, allowing livestock to eat well even in winter. The survival rate of the more than 300 newborn lambs reached 93 percent. This is a significant reform and achievement in animal husbandry methods.

	Chao Geqier is a 60-year-old Mongolian man from the Suboerhan area of the Fourth Nutu Nuke (district) of Juwang Banner. He has rich experience in animal husbandry. However, during the period of reactionary rule, his painstaking efforts in raising livestock were not even enough to pay the levies each year. What he remembers most vividly is that in 1940, the bandit leader Chen Changjie forcibly occupied his pasture. As he fled with the remaining flock, tears in his eyes, to Hangjin Banner, even the sheep were unwilling to leave their homes, some even trying to sneak back to their native Suboerhan pasture at night. He thought sadly: "Sheep are unwilling to leave the place where they grew up and grazed, how can herdsmen bear to abandon their pastures!"

	After liberation, Chairman Mao's brilliant ethnic policy brought him new hope. The Ik Zhao League established a national regional autonomous government, and the Mongolian people became their own masters. In 1950, Chao Geqier returned to Suboerhan with hope and suspicion. He saw that the Mongolian and Han people were united in overthrowing their common enemy, the local despots, and many Han farmers voluntarily returned the land that the landlords had forcibly occupied from the Mongolian people's pastures in the past to the returning Mongolian brothers for grazing. He also returned to his new pasture with his flock. He was moved by this reality and decided to use his grazing experience to develop animal husbandry well.

	Chao Geqier's sheep increased year by year. In 1950, he only had forty sheep, but now he has increased to seventy-eight. In the past two years, only three lambs have died. He attaches great importance to the feeding and management of livestock, studied grazing methods for each season, and usually pays attention to harvesting and storing forage in preparation for winter, and preventing livestock diseases.

	In the spring of 1951, he received education in patriotism and resistance against the United States and aid to Korea, and realized that "only by raising everyone's livestock well can we have more strength to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." He began to publicize to his neighbors the methods of improving the feeding and management of livestock. During the publicity, he found that some herdsmen had difficulties in harvesting grass and digging wells due to lack of labor. He discussed with everyone and decided to learn from the agricultural mutual aid team methods of the Han people. Thus, the first pastoral mutual aid team on the Ik Zhao League grasslands was born. Under the influence and help of Chao Geqier and his mutual aid team, 75 herdsmen in the Suboerhan grassland have formed nine pastoral mutual aid teams. This year, Chao Geqier also united nine mutual aid teams to challenge all herding brothers in the province, playing a great role in the provincial patriotic livestock protection competition.

	Chao Geqier's exemplary behavior has received the attention and praise of the Juwang Banner Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Juwang Banner People's Government. He was awarded the honorary title of "Model Animal Husbandman." Now, he not only actively promotes the experience of improving the feeding and management of livestock to the vast number of herdsmen, but also goes to villages where Han people live to publicize, so that many Han people who lacked grazing experience in the past have also become experts in grazing.

### 朝各切尔和他的牧业互助组

    朝各切尔和他的牧业互助组
    在绥远省伊克昭盟郡王旗辽阔的草原上，几乎所有的牧民都知道畜牧模范朝各切尔的名字。牧民们常常骑马跨越几十里的草原来访问他，向他学习放牧牲畜和组织牧业互助组的经验。
    朝各切尔是伊盟草原上第一个牧业互助组的组织者。他为了解决牧民们分散经营中缺乏劳力的困难，学习了汉人农业互助的办法，首先把十二户牧民组织起来了。一年来，互助组已经把落后的“天牧”方法改变为人牧，家家搭了圈，还有几户盖了棚、打了井。全组共打了一万二千多斤草，使牲畜在冬天也可以吃得很好。新生的三百多只羊羔，活成率达到百分之九十三。这是牧畜方法中的重大改革和成就。
    朝各切尔是郡王旗第四努图努克（区）素泊尔汗的一个六十岁的蒙族老人。他有着丰富的牧畜经验。但是，在反动统治时期，他苦心地饲养，每年增殖的牲畜还不够交摊派。尤其使他难忘的，是一九四零年匪首陈长捷强占了他的牧场，当他含着热泪带着被抢剩的羊群逃亡到杭锦旗去的途中，连那些羊也不愿离开故居，有的竟在晚上要偷着跑回自己生长的素泊尔汗牧场去。他沉痛地想：“羊不愿离开原来生长游息的地方，牧人怎能舍得丢下自己的牧场！”
    解放后，毛主席光辉的民族政策给他带来了新的希望。伊克昭盟成立了民族区域自治政权，蒙族人民自己当家作主了。一九五零年，朝各切尔怀着希望而又怀疑的心情回到素泊尔汗。他看到蒙汉人民团结一致打倒了他们共同的敌人恶霸地主，很多汉族农民自动把过去地主强占蒙民牧场开垦的土地让给回来的蒙族兄弟放牧，他也带着羊群回到了自己的新牧场。他被这种现实的生活感动了，决定要把自己放牧的经验拿出来，好好地发展牧畜业。
    朝各切尔的羊一年比一年多了。一九五零年他只有四十只，现在已经增加到七十八只。两年来，只死过三只小羊。他很重视牲畜的饲养管理，研究了各个季节的放牧方法，在平时还注意了打草储料，以备过冬，和预防牧畜疾病。
    一九五一年春天，他受到了抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，认识到“要把大家的牲畜都养好，才更有力量支援中国人民志愿军”的道理。他开始向邻居宣传改进饲养管理牲畜的方法。他在宣传中发现有的牧民因为劳力缺乏，打草、打井都有困难。他就和大家研究，决定学习汉人农业互助组的办法。于是伊盟草原上第一个牧业互助组产生了。在朝各切尔和他互助组的影响和帮助下，素泊尔汗草原上已经有七十五户牧民组成了九个牧业互助组。今年，朝各切尔还联合九个互助组向全省牧民兄弟提出挑战，在全省爱国保畜竞赛运动中起了很大作用。
    朝各切尔的模范行为，得到了中共郡王旗委员会和郡王旗人民政府的重视和表扬。他得到了“畜牧模范”的光荣称号。现在，他不仅积极地向广大牧民宣传改进饲养管理牲畜的经验，他还到汉人聚居的村庄去宣传，使很多过去缺乏放牧经验的汉人也成了放牧能手。尹明
