    A Brief International Commentary

    Some figures recently released by the U.S. government illustrate that the U.S. government, in order to push forward its policy of military expansion and war preparation, is more and more severely plundering the American working people.

    In order to pay for huge military expenditures, the U.S. government desperately increases taxes. According to an announcement by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service: In the past year, the American people paid a total of 65 billion U.S. dollars in taxes, an increase of 14.5 billion U.S. dollars over the previous year, reaching the highest record in history. In fact, the taxes paid by the American people are much more than this figure. Although the U.S. authorities emphasize that the largest increase in tax revenue is the corporate tax levied on enterprises, the fact that American monopoly capital obtained huge profits last year is enough to show that the taxes paid by major enterprises have been passed on to the vast number of consumers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder also admitted that more than 73 percent of income tax, which accounts for the largest part of tax revenue, is collected from people with meager incomes. Obviously, the heavy tax burden falls on the vast number of working people. At present, the direct and indirect taxes paid by every working person in the United States account for more than 30 percent of their income.

    In addition to bearing huge taxes, the American people also suffer from the disaster of rising prices. According to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the cost of living in the United States reached a new peak in July, an increase of 190.8 percent over pre-war levels. In the first year of the Korean War, the U.S. government paid 7 billion U.S. dollars to arms dealers due to rising prices. Truman recently estimated that the fiscal budget deficit for this year will reach 10.3 billion U.S. dollars.

    Under this plundering policy, the lives of the American people are deteriorating. This has aroused increasingly strong resistance from the American working people; in the past year, workers in various industrial sectors have continuously held strikes to demand wage increases. The unprecedented large-scale steelworkers' strike has just ended recently, and now 470,000 coal miners have gone on strike, which is undoubtedly a heavy blow to the U.S. war preparation plan. The increasing intensification of class contradictions in the United States will accelerate the growth of the U.S. economic crisis.

### 美国经济危机的增长

    美国经济危机的增长
    美国官方最近公布的一些数字，说明了美国政府为了推行扩军备战政策，正愈来愈厉害地掠夺着美国劳动人民。
    为了支付庞大的军事费用，美国政府拚命增加捐税。据美国国内税务局宣布：上一年度美国人民缴纳的税款共达六百五十亿美元，比前一年度增加了一百四十五亿美元，达到了历史上最高的纪录。实际上美国人民所付的税款，比这个数字还要多得多。尽管美国当局强调税收中增加最多的是从企业征收的公司税，但从去年美国垄断资本获得了巨额利润的事实，便足以说明各大企业所缴付的税款是转嫁给广大消费者了。美国财政部长斯奈德也曾承认，占税收最大部分的所得税中，有百分之七十三以上是从收入微薄的人们征来的。显而易见，沉重的捐税负担是落在广大劳动人民的身上。目前美国每一个劳动人民所缴纳的直接税和间接税，已占了他们收入百分之三十以上。
    美国人民除了负担巨额捐税外，还要遭受物价高涨的灾害。据美国劳工统计局报告，美国生活费用在七月份达到新的高峰，比战前提高了百分之一百九十点八。美国政府在侵朝战争第一年中，因物价上涨就向军火商补付了七十亿美元。杜鲁门最近估计本年度财政预算赤字将达一百零三亿美元。
    在这种掠夺政策下，美国人民生活日益恶化。这激起了美国劳动人民日益强烈的抵抗；一年来美国各工业部门不断发生工人为要求增加工资而举行的罢工。空前大规模的钢铁工人罢工最近刚刚结束，现在四十七万煤矿工人又举行了罢工，这对于美国的备战计划无疑是很沉重的打击。美国国内阶级矛盾的日益尖锐化，将使美国的经济危机愈加迅速地增长起来。
