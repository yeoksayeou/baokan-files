    Continuous Major Accidents Involving Casualties
    Editor: From May to early July this year, over sixty accidents, both major and minor, such as runaway mine cars and roof collapses, have occurred continuously at the No. 1 Mine of the Jingxing Coal Mine. In just twenty-two hours from July 7th to 8th, three tragic worker deaths occurred. The facts are as follows: At 9:40 PM on July 7th, worker Li Zengming from Team 206 was pushing coal from the fourth-level tunnel to the No. 3 blind shaft. Because a "safety gate" was not installed at the intersection of the tunnel and the blind shaft, and the "car stop" was not in place, Li Zengming and his coal car fell into the shaft and died. A similar accident occurred last November, resulting in the death of worker Zhang Laba. Afterward, the mine only installed "safety gates" at the site of the accident, neglecting other areas. Workers have repeatedly suggested that "safety gates" be universally installed at tunnel entrances, but relevant personnel emphasized that there was no budget for this and refused to handle it. After this accident, administrative cadres mistakenly believed it was "the worker's own fault." Most intolerable is the coal engineer Zhang Kuiwen, who not only failed to examine his own errors but said, "Even if 'safety gates' were installed, they would still fall to their deaths if they weren't closed." It is because of engineering personnel like Zhang Kuiwen, who disregard workers' lives, and some bureaucratic administrative cadres that at 9:35 AM on July 8th, Wang Mangmang, the head of the main shaft carpenter team of the mechanical and electrical section and an experienced technical worker, fell to his death in the shaft during a "climbing plate" accident while repairing the shaft's can guides. These bloody facts have not yet drawn the attention of relevant personnel, and they have not taken any effective measures to prevent such malignant accidents from happening again. At around 7 PM on July 8th, a blasting accident occurred in Team 151 of the third district, killing a worker.
    The above facts show that the administrative leaders and certain engineering and technical personnel of this mine seriously disregard the safety of workers' lives. This is because they have inherited the capitalist management viewpoint to manage the people's mines and have not truly established the idea of relying on the working class. As the workers say, "Our leaders only care about eating eggs and don't care whether the hen lives or dies." I believe that the relevant cadres of the mine should conduct ideological self-criticism and be duly punished for causing these serious fatal accidents.

### 连续发生重大伤亡事故

    连续发生重大伤亡事故
    编辑同志：井陉煤矿第一矿，从今年五月到七月上旬，连续发生溜车、冒顶等大小事故六十多起。仅七月七日到八日的二十二小时内，就发生三名工人死亡的惨痛事故。事实经过是这样：七月七日晚九点四十分钟，二零六组工人李增明从四层煤巷道往三号暗井推煤，因为巷道和暗井交接的地方没有安装“保安铁门”，“车挡”也没有挡上。李增明推煤车过去时，连车带人摔到井下而死。去年十一月间，该矿曾发生过同样的事故，摔死了工人张啦叭。事后矿方只在发生事故的地方安上了“保安门”，别处就不管了。工人曾多次提出意见，要求在巷道口普遍安装“保安铁门”。有关人员却强调没有这笔开支，不给办理。这次事故发生后，行政干部还错误地认为是“工人自己的过失”。最不能容忍的是煤师张奎文，他不但不检查自己的错误，却说：“就是安上‘保安铁门’不关也一样会摔死。”正因为有不顾工人生命安全的张奎文这样的工程人员和一些官僚主义的行政干部，以致在七月八日上午九点三十五分钟，机电股大井木匠组长、老技术工人王忙忙，在检修暗井罐道时，又发生了“爬盘”事故，摔死在井下。这些血的事实，仍然没有引起有关人员的注意，他们还没有采取任何有效措施来制止这样恶性事故的再次发生，七月八日晚七时许，三区一五一组又发生打炮崩死工人事故。
    以上事实，说明这个矿的行政领导干部和某些工程技术人员，严重地漠视工人生命安全。这是因为他们承袭了资本主义的经营观点来管理人民的矿山，没有真正树立依靠工人阶级的思想。正如工人们说的：“咱们的领导，光吃鸡蛋，不管鸡死活。”我认为，该矿有关干部，对造成这些严重的死亡事故，应该从思想上进行检查并受到应得的处分。
