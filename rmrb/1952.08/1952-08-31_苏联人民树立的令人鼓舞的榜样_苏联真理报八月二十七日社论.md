The public in all countries of the world is now studying and commenting with great attention on the news of the convocation of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), published in Pravda, and the documents related to the congress. Much attention is focused on the draft directives of the 19th Congress of the CPSU on the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union for 1951-1955.

The draft directives state: "This five-year plan is a plan for peaceful economic and cultural construction. This plan will further consolidate and expand economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and develop our economic relations with all countries willing to develop trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

The peaceful development of the Soviet economy stipulated in the Five-Year Plan stands in stark contrast to the economies of capitalist countries, which are militarizing their national economies, allowing capitalists to seize huge profits while impoverishing the working people."

This new grand plan for the peaceful development of the Soviet Union once again proves to the people of the world the great vitality of socialism and the fundamental superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system, and thus naturally arouses the greatest concern of the broadest sections of people in various countries.

Comrade Stalin, as early as twenty years ago, when talking about the results of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, emphasized the international impact of our economic development.

Comrade Stalin said: "As soon as we have carried out a construction work in two or three years, as soon as we have shown the first successes of the Five-Year Plan, the world has been divided into two camps: people in one camp are barking at us, while people in the other camp are astonished by the success of the Five-Year Plan; not to mention, we have our own increasingly strengthened camp all over the world, which is the camp of the working class in capitalist countries, who feel happy because of the success of the Soviet working class and are determined to help the Soviet working class, frightening the bourgeoisie all over the world.

What does this mean?

This means that the international significance of the Five-Year Plan, the international significance of all kinds of successes and achievements of the Five-Year Plan, is beyond doubt."

Since these talks were published, the Soviet people have successfully completed the Stalin Five-Year Plans one after another, and have achieved epoch-making victories. Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet people have built socialism and are gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. The achievements of peaceful construction in the Soviet Union are increasing every year, and their international significance is also constantly increasing.

The rich experience of the Soviet Union in successfully building socialism is an inspiring example for the working people of various people's democratic countries, who have freed themselves from the shackles of capitalism and, with the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union, are marching confidently towards a new and bright future. The further consolidation of the strength and regime of the Soviet Union and the further development of the Soviet economy are a guarantee for the people's democratic countries to achieve more and more achievements.

The great achievements of our national economy stand in sharp contrast to the economic decline of capitalist countries. Comparing the achievements of the Soviet socialist planned economy with the results of the anarchic and predatory economy of capitalist countries, the people of all countries will believe that the Soviet socialist system is superior to the outdated capitalist system. They find that in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the economy is constantly developing and progressing, while in the United States and other capitalist countries, there is a long-term recession, the number of unemployed is increasing, and the masses are becoming increasingly impoverished.

The achievements of the Soviet economy are indeed of great significance for the struggle for peace. The people of all countries who are fighting to maintain and consolidate peace and to oppose the imperialist conspiracy to instigate a new war look up with hope and pride to the great Soviet country, the impregnable fortress of world peace.

The working people of all countries know that all the historical victories of the Soviet people of all nationalities cannot but be attributed to the wise leadership of the Communist Party and the great leader and teacher J.V. Stalin. This is why the working people of the world regard the news of the convocation of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) as an epoch-making event.

The Chinese "Wenhui Daily" said: "The victories of the Soviet Union on all fronts are the common victories of the people of the world; because the strength of the Soviet Union marks the strength of the world's peace and democratic forces; the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union's communist construction inspire the people of the world to strengthen their struggle for people's democracy.

We, the Chinese people, seeing this glorious example of the Soviet Union, will surely strengthen our confidence, strive to defend peace, build our motherland, and march towards the future of socialism."

The Polish "People's Tribune" said: "The draft directives of the 19th Congress on the Fifth Five-Year Plan fill the hearts of every peace-loving person with pride, because this plan guarantees the further rapid development of the Soviet economy and guarantees the further consolidation of the Soviet Union, the fortress of the international peace camp. ... Millions of men and women all over the world are very excited to hear the news of the new Soviet Five-Year Plan, because they know that the further strengthening of the Soviet Union's strength is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the struggle against the imperialist warmongers."

The French "L'Humanité" pointed out: "The capitalist world is sinking deeper and deeper into the abyss of poverty and chaos, while the Soviet Union is constantly moving forward on the road to communism with one victory after another. What a stark contrast! Who can sincerely doubt the peaceful intentions of such a country and its government? The Soviet Union not only hopes for peace, but also believes that peace can be saved. ..."

The ruling groups of capitalist countries are doing everything possible to prevent their people from seeing the historic documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). The bourgeois newspapers publish all kinds of empty talk and lies, trying to prevent their masses from knowing the achievements of this socialist country. The American propaganda organs, which determine the direction of the bourgeois newspapers, are now trying to confuse readers and distort the current tasks of the 19th Party Congress. The imperialist warmongers have assigned the task to the profiteering press to use poisonous lies and slander to cover up the truth.

However, the truth cannot be covered up. No matter what obstacles the ruling classes of capitalist countries set up, the people will still see the truth.

In capitalist countries, the working class and its parties, who seriously fulfill their international obligations, are fulfilling the noble task of spreading the truth and will fulfill it to the end.

Therefore, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, located in Düsseldorf (West Germany), issued a statement on August 21, reminding the entire German people, especially all members and cadres of the German Communist Party, to pay attention to the great significance of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). The Central Committee called on all communists and all German patriots to "more resolutely refute the anti-people and anti-Soviet propaganda, and more diligently promote the great cause of peace of the Soviet Union and its party - the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)".

As the democratic public in various countries correctly emphasized in their talks, the convocation of the 19th Party Congress is an event of great international significance. Our Party will sum up the great achievements completed since the 18th Party Congress, and will formulate further work plans for a communist society. The working people of all countries have realized that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the inspirer and organizer of all the victories of the Soviet people.

Comrade Stalin said: If the Communist Party knows its goals and is not afraid of difficulties, then it is invincible. Today, we hear this sentence with particular force. The Lenin-Stalin Party is confidently leading the Soviet people towards the victory of communism!

    苏联人民树立的令人鼓舞的榜样
    ——苏联真理报八月二十七日社论
    全世界各国的公众现在正以极大的注意力，研究和评论真理报发表的关于召开苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会的消息，以及有关代表大会的文件。有很大的注意力都是集中于联共第十九次代表大会关于一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划的指示草案。
    指示草案说：“这个五年计划是和平的经济和文化建设的计划。这个计划将进一步巩固和扩大苏联与人民民主国家之间的经济合作，发展我们和所有愿意根据平等互利的原则发展贸易的各国之间的经济关系。
    五年计划中所规定的苏联经济的和平发展，与资本主义国家的经济恰恰相反，那些国家正在使国民经济军国主义化，使资本家攫取巨额利润，同时使劳动人民更加贫困。”
    这个新的使苏联和平发展的宏伟计划，又一次向全世界的人们证明了社会主义的伟大生命力和社会主义经济制度对资本主义经济制度的根本优越性，因而自然而然引起了各国最广泛人士的最大关心。
    斯大林同志早在二十年前谈到第一个五年计划执行的结果时，就曾着重指出我国经济发展在国际上的影响。
    斯大林同志说：“只须我们在两三年内进行了一番建设工作，只须我们显示了五年计划第一批成功，就使全世界分成了两个营垒：一个营垒里的人向我们狂吠不已，另一个营垒里的人却目睹五年计划成功而感觉惊异；更不必说，在全世界上都有我们自己日益加强起来的营垒，这就是资本主义各国工人阶级的营垒，他们因苏联工人阶级成功而感觉欢乐，决意帮助苏联工人阶级，而使全世界资产阶级胆战心惊。
    这是说明什么呢？
    这就是说，五年计划底国际意义，五年计划所有各种成功和成绩底国际意义，是不容怀疑的。”
    自从这些谈话发表以后，苏联人民顺利地一个接一个地完成了斯大林五年计划，取得了划时代的胜利。苏联人民在列宁—斯大林党的领导下已建成了社会主义并正从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义。苏联和平建设的成就每年都在增加而其国际意义也在不断增加。
    苏联胜利建设社会主义的丰富经验是鼓舞各人民民主国家劳动人民的榜样，他们已摆脱了资本主义的枷锁，在苏联的友好援助之下，满怀信心地朝着崭新的、灿烂的前途迈进。苏联的力量和政权的进一步巩固，苏联经济的进一步发展是各人民民主国家获得越来越多的成就的一个保障。
    我们的国民经济的伟大成就和资本主义国家经济的衰落恰成鲜明的对比。把苏联社会主义计划经济的成就跟资本主义国家无政府状态的掠夺性经济带来的结果加以比较，各国人民就会相信，苏联的社会主义制度比已经过时的资本主义制度优越。他们发现：在苏联和人民民主国家，经济不断发展，不断进步，而在美国及其他资本主义国家则是长期的不景气，失业人数增加，群众日益贫穷。
    苏联经济的成就对于争取和平的斗争的确有很重大的意义。为维护和巩固和平、为反对帝国主义煽动新战争的阴谋而斗争的各国人民，怀着期望和骄傲的心情仰望着世界和平的不可攻破的堡垒——伟大的苏维埃国家。
    各国劳动人民知道：苏联各族人民的一切历史性胜利的获得，都不能不归功于共产党和伟大的领袖与导师约·维·斯大林的英明领导。世界各国劳动人民之所以认为召开苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会的消息是一个划时代的大事，就是由于这个原因。
    中国“文汇报”说：“苏联在各个战线上的胜利，是全世界人民共同的胜利；因为苏联的强大，标志着世界和平民主力量的强大；苏联共产主义建设的辉煌成就，鼓舞着全世界人民为争取人民民主而加强奋斗。
    我们中国人民，看到苏联这种光辉的榜样，必然将更加强信心，努力保卫和平，建设祖国，向社会主义的前途迈进。”
    波兰“人民论坛报”说：“第十九次代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示草案使每一个爱好和平的人心中充满了骄傲，因为这个计划保证使苏联经济进一步迅速发展，保证国际和平阵营的堡垒——苏联——的进一步巩固。……全世界千百万男女听到苏联新五年计划的消息，都非常兴奋，因为他们知道，苏联实力的进一步加强是反对帝国主义战争贩子的斗争获得胜利的最可靠的保障。”
    法国“人道报”指出：“资本主义世界正一天一天陷入贫困和混乱的深渊，而苏联却在一个胜利接连一个胜利地沿着通往共产主义的道路不断前进，这是多么鲜明的一个对比！谁能够一心怀疑这样的
    一个国家及其政府的和平意愿呢？苏联不仅希望和平，而且相信和平是可以拯救的。……”
    资本主义国家的统治集团正竭尽所能不让他们的人民看到关于苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会的历史性文件。资产阶级报纸发表形形色色的空论和谎言，企图不让它们的人民群众知道这个社会主义国家的成就。决定资产阶级报纸路线的美国宣传机关，现在正尽力混淆读者视听，对第十九次党代表大会的当前任务加以曲解。帝国主义战争贩子给唯利是图的报界规定的任务是用有毒的谎言和毁谤来蒙蔽真理。
    但是，真理是蒙蔽不住的。无论资本主义国家的统治阶级设下什么障碍，人民还是会看到真理的。
    在资本主义国家中，严肃地履行着国际义务的工人阶级及其政党，正在履行传播真理的崇高任务，并将履行到底。
    所以，设在杜塞尔多夫（西德）的德国共产党中央委员会书记处于八月二十一日发表了一篇声明，提醒全德人民，特别是德国共产党的全体党员和干部，注意苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会的伟大意义。中央委员会号召所有的共产党员和全德的爱国人士“更加坚决地驳斥反人民的反苏宣传，更加努力地宣传苏联以及它的政党——苏联共产党（布尔什维克）——的伟大的和平事业”。
    正如各国的民主公众在他们的谈话中正确地强调指出的，第十九次党代表大会的召开是一件具有伟大的国际意义的事件。我们的党将总结自第十八次党代表大会以来完成的伟大业迹，并将为共产主义社会拟定进一步的工作计划。各国劳动人民都已认识到苏联共产党是苏联人民的一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者。
    斯大林同志说过：如果共产党知道它的目标，并且不怕困难，那末它就是不可战胜的。这句话我们今天听起来觉得特别有力。列宁—斯大林的党正满怀信心地领导着苏联人民走向共产主义的胜利！
