Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: According to TASS, approximately forty anti-war rallies were held in various parts of Japan on August 15th to commemorate the seventh anniversary of Japan's surrender. Simultaneously, Korean residents organized one hundred and twenty-five rallies to celebrate the seventh anniversary of Korea's liberation. A rally attended by over a thousand Japanese people passed a resolution protesting the implementation of conscription, demanding the dissolution of the "Police Reserve Force," and calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The Japan National Relief Association has decided to hold a month-long campaign against war and fascism, and to defend human rights. The Association will strive to secure the immediate release of those arrested in the so-called "Matsukawa Incident" and the Tokyo "May Day" incident.

In addition, to prepare for participation in the International Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights to be held in Vienna next February, Japanese youth representatives held a national youth conference against war and in support of rights in Tokyo from the 14th. Approximately 500 representatives from the All-Japan Youth Women's Conference, the Youth Fatherland Front, the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, and the youth departments of trade unions such as the National Railway and Coal Miners' Unions participated in the conference. They opposed rearmament and demanded reasonable wages.
