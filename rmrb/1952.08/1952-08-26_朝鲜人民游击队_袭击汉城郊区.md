    朝鲜人民游击队
    袭击汉城郊区
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社平壤二十二日讯：朝鲜中央通讯社报道：在南朝鲜作战的朝鲜人民游击队曾经袭击汉城和永登浦之间的工业区。
    朝鲜中央通讯社报道：在八月十七日，游击队对李承晚伪军和警察发动了两小时的进攻。在这次战斗中，游击队歼灭了许多李承晚伪军和伪警察人员，摧毁了永登浦的伪警察局及反动的恐怖组织“大韩青年团”的区团部。游击队并袭击了永登浦的火车站。
    游击队对汉城郊外的英勇的袭击，使美国和李承晚的军事当局陷于一片慌乱。大队美军和李承晚伪军仓皇出动，打算把游击队消灭，然而游击队在结束他们的战斗以后，没有丝毫损失便转移到别的地区去了。
