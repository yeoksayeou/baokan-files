Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: People from all walks of life in Japan are enthusiastically concerned about the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The work of preparing to participate in this peace conference has gradually developed into a mass movement.

The Japan Peace Protection Committee has put forward five proposals, including opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, abolishing the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and demanding overall peace negotiations, as proposals to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The Japan Peace Protection Committee has also decided to promote the peace movement according to the direction of the five proposals, with particular emphasis on promoting the opposition to rearmament and the opposition to the conscription movement, and to make promoting Sino-Japanese and Soviet-Japanese trade and promoting the success of the Korean armistice negotiations as important goals of the peace movement. In its specific guidelines for promoting the "Peace Movement Month" (June 25 to August 15), the Japan Peace Protection Committee also stipulates that a national movement with the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference as its goal should be launched. First, local organizations and various industries will discuss the significance of this peace conference separately, and then national organizations, famous people, and various localities will recommend representatives to attend the conference.

On July 17, Osaka held a preparatory meeting on Japan's participation in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Representatives from various political parties, trade unions, and other mass organizations, as well as well-known figures from the scientific and cultural circles, participated in the preparatory meeting. The meeting decided to establish the Japan Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

Now, a vigorous movement to elect representatives to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is being launched throughout Japan. In Kanagawa Prefecture, under the initiative of Kumao Terada, chairman of the local Peace Protection Association, pastors, prefectural assembly members, national capitalists, and trade union leaders, the Okayama Prefecture Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference was established, and almost all of the prefecture's major trade unions participated in this organization. On June 28, the preparatory committee held a peace conference, and the famous Japanese peace fighter Ikuo Oyama was also invited to attend. The peace conference elected Kumao Terada and agricultural scientist Kinichi Yoshioka as representatives to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and Eijiro Shiraga, chairman of the Okayama Prefecture Transport Workers' Union, Mr. Jiang of the United Democratic Front of Korean Residents, and Maeda of Okayama University as alternate representatives. In addition, the Okayama Prefecture Youth Conference has decided to send Nagai, the chairman of the conference, as a representative of rural youth in Japan to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. In Kanagawa Prefecture, an industrial zone in Japan, Masaji Tanaka, director of the Kanagawa Prefecture Trade Union Bureau, Takahashi of the Shinmei Branch of Ikegai Iron Works, Kusunoki of the Kawasaki Peace Protection Association, and Suzuki of the Yokohama Civil Affairs Group have been elected as representatives.

In addition, the Japan Government Officials (Government Agency) Trade Union Council decided to support the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference at an enlarged meeting of the executive committee on June 30 and will send representatives to participate. The meeting also decided that the current struggle policy of the trade union organization is to oppose the militarization and colonization of Japanese government agencies, and to demand the abolition of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and the "Administrative Agreement."
