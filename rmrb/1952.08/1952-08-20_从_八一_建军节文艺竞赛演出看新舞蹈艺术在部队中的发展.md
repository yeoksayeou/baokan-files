From the "August 1st" Army Day Art Competition Performance, Seeing the Development of New Dance Art in the Military
Wu Xiaobang

Five years ago, when the Northeast troops of the People's Liberation Army launched a military training movement, our dance workers, under the leadership of the Party, cooperated with the movement, using mass dance performances to encourage the soldiers' enthusiasm for military training. Starting from performing "Military Training Dance" and "Marching Dance," we elevated the dance activities in the military a step further.

After the nationwide liberation, with the improvement of the cultural life of the entire army, the soldiers demanded new developments in cultural and recreational activities. Thus, dance activities became one of the main cultural and recreational activities of the entire army. At the same time, since several dances reflecting the lives of soldiers had been popularized in the military, extensive soldier-performing-for-soldiers dance activities were carried out, bringing the army's dance activities to a climax.

After May of last year, the military's dance workers discussed how to master dance as a tool to reflect the lives of soldiers in more aspects. After this period of deliberation, new experiments were conducted, and the military's dance art took on a new look. The army's dance programs that competed in the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army were very exciting, and many new creations appeared in art.

In the six days of performances, 43 dance programs participated in the competition. Except for a few programs that still had problems in their creative ideas, many other programs more or less reflected the essence of the People's Liberation Army and the lives of the soldiers, which is the advantage of military dance art. On the other hand, because the new dance activities developed particularly fast within the military, a tendency of "simple life simulation" arose. This tendency also existed more or less in this performance program. Some people believe that this shortcoming is a crisis in dance creation, saying that it is completely unacceptable. In the eyes of our dance workers, this shortcoming is an inevitable stage in the development process. Military dance activities are still in their infancy. Simple life simulation is certainly insufficient, but from another perspective, this is also the result of starting from real life. We believe that further improvement can be achieved through this competition performance.

Compared with previous works, such as the "Marching Dance" in Northeast China in 1948, the "Artillery Dance" in North China in 1950, the "Soldier's Game Dance" in Central and South China in 1951, the Navy's "Sailor Dance" and "Happy Sailor," and the "Saber Dance" in Inner Mongolia in 1950, this competition program has made new progress and creation. For example, more than a dozen programs, such as the "Literacy Competition Dance" in Central and South China, the "Road Building Dance" and "Tibetan Cavalry Dance" in Southwest China, the "Short Break" of the Volunteer Army, and the Navy's "Engine Room Soldier Dance" and "Landing Dance," have made significant progress compared to the past. As for the creations of the broad masses of soldiers themselves, such as the "Tunnel Dance" of the Volunteer Army, which showed rich imagination and its healthy and simple style, are also worth praising. These many representative works prove the importance of going deep into life practice for doing a good job in creation. It also shows that the reason for the failure of the "Soldier Dance" and "Sea Reconnaissance Soldier" in East China is that they did not go deep enough into life and did not resolutely eliminate the creative ideas that were divorced from reality.

The following are my impressions of some of the new and excellent programs in this competition. The "Artillery Dance" and "Soldier's Game Dance" are earlier creations that are already familiar to everyone, so I will not discuss them here.

Southwest's "Road Building Dance." This dance reflects that our People's Liberation Army can not only fight victoriously against the enemy on the front line, but also overcome difficulties and struggles with nature, and successfully complete the project of opening the Kangzang Highway. Our Southwest dance workers have skillfully portrayed the PLA soldiers as so brave and decisive, and the magnificent pictures depict the epic story of the road building soldiers. This dance is also very high in technique. At the same time, every action is not ambiguous, they are very able to concentrate the action, so that every action can be understood and felt that there is a huge force in the dance, vividly illustrating that the PLA is an invincible hero. This dance can be said to be one of the excellent works of 1952, if we cut this work into six paintings, we will also be moved by the picture. Another feature is that in the accompaniment music, because it absorbs folk songs, it strengthens the effect of the dance and makes the characters more amiable and lovely.

The shortcoming of this program is that when the author created the characters, he did not highlight the two roles of the group leader and the model from beginning to end, and he did not explain the relationship between these two people and the masses clearly. A good dance must express the characters, and must not simply explain things, but must clearly portray the characters. Now the characters in this dance do not leave a deep impression on the audience, only through the collective human actions can some of the difficult process of road construction be felt, but the heroic and exemplary deeds are not fully expressed.

Central and South China's "Literacy Competition Dance." This program was created by Central and South China dance workers after participating in the soldiers' cultural studies. It reflects the soldiers' pleasant mood of learning culture, they cleverly combine dance and learning culture, and express the soldiers' enthusiasm for learning through the competition between Class A and Class B.

The greatest advantage of this program is that it can be popularized. The techniques used in it are familiar to the soldiers, so they can develop new creativity from the learning of this dance, and no longer stay in the past stage.

It is worth learning that Central and South China dance workers can break through the format of "Soldier's Game Dance" to reflect new life. But it also has its shortcomings: (1) It did not cooperate well with the music composer, so the music is not characteristic, but a simple soundtrack; (2) It did not boldly use the national and folk dance traditions to portray the characters in the shape, so that the steps used in the dance can hardly see the national characteristics. Especially in the happy ending after the competition, it also borrowed the Western collective dance form, lacking national characteristics.

Southwest's "Tibetan Cavalry Dance." This is one of the successful programs in the Southwest. The audience generally likes this work, feeling that it has majestic power and the strong life atmosphere of the Tibetan people, and it is very moving. But this dance is not well handled in the scene of practicing live ammunition shooting on horseback, shooting at the audience and shooting at each other. But this dance is basically successful in creation. The actors' skills are also very skilled.

Volunteer Army's "Short Break." Why do I want to introduce "Short Break" to the readers? Because in the past, there was a view in the military dance work that the Yangko steps (folk dance steps) could not be used to express the lives of soldiers, and the lives of soldiers must be expressed by another kind of dance steps. Because of the clear character image of "Short Break" in the performance, it proves that the folk dance steps can be developed, and it is also suitable for expressing the lives of soldiers. The Volunteer Army's dance workers boldly used folk dance steps, so that the audience could see the image and character of the most lovable people in the dance. The soldiers stepping on the folk dance steps appear more lovable as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the image. Although "Short Break" belongs to a kind of song and dance form, and is different from other dance forms, but from our dance tradition, because the actors of "Short Break" can use folk dance steps to produce new effects, I hope that the dance workers of the whole army will also strive to learn the excellent traditions of Chinese folk dance, and create healthy, lovely, lively, new representative national soldier images in the future.

Navy's "Engine Room Soldier Dance." This dance shows the Navy's enthusiasm for learning the technology of mastering the engine room, and beautifully shows the soldiers' love for machinery. The machine is beautified here. However, the creator did not focus on describing the ideological feelings of the two engine room soldiers. In the handling, the focus was on the engine room, so that the characters (the old engine room soldier and the new engine room soldier) were not highlighted, and the activities of the machine exceeded the characters. For example, the Soviet engine room dance we saw last year was different. It clearly showed the ideological qualities of the sailors.

The above are just some examples of excellent programs.

When the whole army eliminates illiteracy and improves culture in 1953, the soldiers' requirements for dance art will certainly be further improved. In order to meet the new requirements of the masses and meet the new tasks, dance workers must create better dance programs than this year. We believe that the military dance workers will further go deep into life, improve their skills, learn national forms, and give full play to greater creativity, and will certainly create greater achievements.

    从“八一”建军节文艺竞赛演出看新舞蹈艺术在部队中的发展
    吴晓邦
    五年前人民解放军东北部队发动练兵运动，我们舞蹈工作者曾在党的领导下配合了运动，通过群众性的舞蹈表演来鼓动战士们的练兵热潮。从演出“练兵舞”和“进军舞”开始，把部队中的舞蹈活动提高了一步。
    全国解放后，随着全军文化生活的提高，战士们对文娱活动要求着新的发展。于是舞蹈活动变成了全军主要的文娱活动之一。同时由于过去几个反映战士生活的舞蹈已在部队中普及，开展了广泛的兵演兵的舞蹈活动，使全军的舞蹈活动进入了高潮。
    去年五月以后部队的舞蹈工作者，讨论到如何掌握舞蹈这一个工具，使它更多方面地去反映战士生活。经过这一次酝酿，进行了新的试验，部队中的舞蹈艺术出现了新的面目。此次在庆祝人民解放军建军二十五周年纪念时竞赛演出的全军舞蹈节目，是十分令人兴奋的，在艺术上出现了不少新的创造。
    在六天的演出中，参加竞赛的舞蹈节目有四十三个。除个别节目在创作思想上还有问题以外，其它许多节目或多或少地都反映了人民解放军的本质和战士的生活，这是部队舞蹈艺术的优点。另一方面，由于新舞蹈活动在部队内发展得特别快，所以产生了“单纯的生活模拟”的倾向。这个倾向，在这次演出节目内也是或多或少存在的。有人认为这个缺点是舞蹈创作上的危机，说是完全要不得。在我们舞蹈工作者看来，这一缺点是发展过程中必经的阶段。部队舞蹈活动还是在萌芽的时期，单纯的生活模拟固然嫌不足，但从另一面看，这也是从生活实际出发的结果。我们相信，通过这次竞赛演出，可以获得进一步的提高。
    比起过去的作品来，如一九四八年东北的“进军舞”、一九五○年华北的“炮兵舞”、一九五一年中南的“战士游戏舞”、海军的“水手舞”和“快乐的水兵”、一九五○年内蒙的“马刀舞”等，这一次的竞赛节目，已有了新的进步和创造。比如说，中南的“识字竞赛舞”、西南的“筑路舞”和“藏民骑兵舞”、志愿军的“小休息”、海军的“轮机兵舞”和“登陆舞”等十几个节目，比起过去已有显著的进步。至于广大战士们自己的创作，如志愿军的“坑道舞”表现了丰富的想像力和它的健康朴素的作风也是值得赞美的。这许多代表性的作品，证明了深入生活实践对于搞好创作的重要性。同时也说明了像华东的“战士舞”和“海上侦察兵”之所以失败，也就是深入生活不够，没有坚决肃清脱离实际的创作思想的缘故。
    以下是我对此次竞赛中的一部分新的优秀节目的观感，“炮兵舞”和“战士游戏舞”是已经为大家所熟悉的较早的创作，这里略去不谈。
    西南的“筑路舞”。这一个舞蹈反映了我们的人民解放军不但能够胜利地在前线上和敌人作战，同时也能够克服艰难困苦和自然界作斗争，胜利地完成了开辟康藏公路的工程。我们西南舞蹈工作者有才能地把解放军战士刻划得如此英勇果敢，一幅幅雄壮的画面描画出筑路战士的史诗般的故事。这个舞蹈在技术上也是很高的。同时每一个动作都没有含糊过去，他们很能把动作集中起来，使每一个动作都能使人看得懂和感受到舞内有一种巨大的力量，形象地说明了解放军是无敌的英雄。这一个舞蹈可以说是一九五二年的优秀作品之一，如果我们把这一个作品切成六张画来看，也会被画面所感动的。还有一个特点，就是在伴奏音乐上，因为吸收了民歌，加强了舞的效果，使人物显得更加可亲可爱。
    这一个节目的缺点，是作者创造人物时，没有把组长和模范两个角色，从头到尾都突现出来，同时也没有把这两个人和群众的关系交代清楚。一个好的舞蹈必须表现人物，决不能单纯地说明事物，而是要清楚地刻划人物。现在这一个舞内的人物对观众的印象是不深的，只是通过集体的人的动作才感受到一些筑路的艰难过程，而没有把英勇模范的事迹充分表现出来。
    中南的“识字竞赛舞”。这一个节目是中南舞蹈工作者参加了战士的文化学习后创作的。它反映了战士们学文化的愉快情绪，他们巧妙地把舞蹈和学文化相结合起来，并通过甲乙两班的竞赛来表现战士们的学习的热情。
    这一个节目的最大的优点，就是能普及。其中使用的技术是战士们平时所熟练的，因而可以发挥战士们从这一个舞蹈的学习中发展新的创造性，而不再停留在过去的阶段上。
    中南舞蹈工作者能突破“战士游戏舞”的格式，去反映新的生活，是值得学习的。可是也还有它的缺点：（一）没有很好地和音乐作曲者精心合作，因而音乐没有特色，只是一种简单的配音；（二）在造型上没有大胆地从民族的和民间舞蹈传统的基础上去刻划人物，以致舞蹈中使用的步法几乎看不出民族的特点来。尤其在竞赛后愉快的收场上，还袭用了西洋的集体舞形式，缺乏民族色彩。
    西南的“藏民骑兵舞”。这是西南的节目中的成功的一个。观众普遍喜欢这一个作品，感到它有雄伟的力量和藏族的浓厚的生活气息，它很能感动人。可是这一个舞在练习马上实弹射击时，向观众射击和互相对射的场面是处理得不够好的。但这一个舞蹈在创作上基本是成功的。演员的技术也很熟练。
    志愿军的“小休息”。我为什么要把“小休息”提出来向读者介绍呢？因为过去在部队舞蹈工作中曾经有一种看法，认为秧歌步法（民间舞的步法）是不能用来表现战士生活的，战士的生活必须用另外的一种舞蹈步法来表现。由于“小休息”在演出上人物形象的显明，证明了民间的舞蹈步法是可以发展的，用于表现战士生活，也是适宜的。志愿军的舞蹈工作者大胆使用了民间舞蹈的步法，使观众看到舞蹈中的最可爱的人物的形象及其性格。战士们踏着民间舞蹈的步法，在形象上就更显得是可爱的中国人民志愿军。这一个舞蹈表现得很熟练，人物是生动的。虽则“小休息”属于一种歌舞形式，和其他舞蹈形式有所不同，可是从我们舞蹈的传统上来看，因为“小休息”的演员们能使用民间舞蹈的步法而产生了新的效果，所以我希望全军的舞蹈工作者也要努力学习中国民间舞蹈的优良传统，将来创造出健康的、可爱的、活泼的新的代表民族的战士形象来。
    海军的“轮机兵舞”。这个舞表现了海军对掌握轮机技术的学习热情，优美地显示了战士对机械的爱好。机械在这里被美化了。但创作者没有着重描写两个轮机兵的思想感情，在处理上，把重点放在轮机上，以致人物（老轮机兵和新轮机兵）就突不出来，机器的活动超过了人物。比如去年我们看到的苏联轮机舞，那就不同，它鲜明地使人看到了水兵的思想品质。
    以上仅是优秀节目中的一部分例子。
    当一九五三年全军消灭了文盲，提高了文化的时候，战士们对舞蹈艺术的要求一定会更加提高一步，舞蹈工作者为了满足群众的新的要求，迎接新的任务，必须创造比今年更好的舞蹈节目。我们相信，部队舞蹈工作者今后进一步深入生活，提高技术，学习民族形式，发挥更大的创造性，一定会创造出更大的成绩。
