    Li Changyou Corrects His Mistake of Looking Down on Receiving and Dispatching Work
    Editor: After reading the letter "Receiving and Dispatching Work Should Not Be Looked Down Upon" published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the July 29th People's Daily, I conducted a self-examination.
    I work in the receiving and dispatching section of the Secretariat of the Public Security Bureau of Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, but I used to look down on receiving and dispatching work. I did not realize that receiving and dispatching work is an important part of revolutionary work. On the contrary, I thought that doing receiving and dispatching work had "no future," and that "only people without ability do receiving and dispatching work." When someone asked me what I did, I was afraid to say I did receiving and dispatching work, and instead replied, "I do general work." Saying that I do receiving and dispatching work felt "unpleasant," and I always felt that "others looked down on me." After reading the letter "Receiving and Dispatching Work Should Not Be Looked Down Upon," I realized that my previous thoughts were very wrong. Now, I have realized the importance of receiving and dispatching work. In the future, I will definitely do my job well and never make mistakes such as accumulating and losing documents or leaking secrets.

    李长有改变了轻视收发工作的错误
    编辑同志：我看了七月二十九日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的“不应轻视收发工作”一信后，作了自我检讨。
    我在辽西省义县人民政府公安局秘书股做收发工作，但我过去是轻视收发工作的。我没有认识到收发工作是革命工作的重要一环。相反地，我认为作收发工作“没前途”，认为“没有能力的人才作收发工作”。当有人问我作什么工作时，我不敢说作收发工作，而答复：“作一般工作”。如说作收发工作，就感到“不好听”；也总觉得“别人瞧不起自己”。自从看了“不应轻视收发工作”一信后，我认识到自己以前的思想是非常错误的。现在，我已经认识到收发工作的重要性。今后我一定要作好我的工作，决不发生积压和遗失文件以及泄露机密等错误。    李长有
