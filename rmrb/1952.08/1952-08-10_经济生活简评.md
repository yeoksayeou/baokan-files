Economic Life Brief Commentary

    Systematically and Methodically Promote Various Advanced Experiences in the Power Industry System
    The Advanced Experience Promotion Conference of the Power Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department introduced more than sixty kinds of advanced experiences and inventions for improving power production to various bureaus and plants. How to promote them? This must be done systematically and methodically.
    First, it is necessary to focus on experiences that have a decisive significance, such as burning low-value coal, rapid overhaul, scientific routine inspection methods, adjusting power load, and assembly line methods in civil engineering and construction. These are all key to solving power production problems. Each bureau and plant must prioritize and promote them accordingly. Second, after identifying the key areas, each bureau and plant must also develop practical promotion plans based on the specific conditions of their own units, making full preparations ideologically, technically, and organizationally, and conducting various necessary experiments before gradually promoting them. Only in this way can the promotion work progress steadily. Third, each bureau and plant must pay attention to learning from the experiences of other units in promoting advanced experiences, constantly improving their own work, and avoiding rash actions.
    In order to promote advanced experience, it is necessary to oppose bureaucratic leadership methods, which involve not making plans, not making preparations, not conducting experiments, but holding several conferences and making several mobilization reports, and then handing over many important advanced experiences to the masses for learning and promotion all at once. This approach may "boom" open the situation at once, but various problems will inevitably follow and cannot be solved. The leadership will be completely passive, and the enthusiasm of employees to learn advanced experience will also decline. Leading comrades in various bureaus and plants should pay attention and avoid the occurrence of this phenomenon.

    经济生活简评
    有计划有步骤地推广电业系统中的各种先进经验
    中央燃料工业部电业管理总局的推广先进工作经验大会，向各局、厂介绍了改进电业生产的先进经验和发明创造有六十多种，怎样去推广呢？这就必须有计划有步骤地进行。
    首先，必须抓着有决定意义的经验，例如燃烧低值煤、快速检修、科学巡回检查法、调整电力负荷以及土木建筑方面的流水作业法等数种，都是解决电业生产的关键，各个局、厂必须分别轻重缓急，加以推广。其次，有了重点以后，各局、厂还必须根据本单位的具体情况，做出切实可行的推广计划，从思想上、技术上、组织上进行充分的准备，并先进行各种必要的试验，而后逐步推广。这样才能使推广工作得以稳步前进。再次，各个局、厂必须注意吸取其他各单位在推广先进经验中的教训，随时改进自己的工作，切忌草率从事。
    为了推广先进经验，必须反对官僚主义的领导方法，这就是不做计划、不做准备，不进行试验，开上几次大会，做上几次动员报告，就把许多重要的先进经验一下交给群众去学习、推广。这种做法，也许可以一下就“轰”开了局面，但是各种问题必然会接踵而至，并无法解决。领导方面既完全陷于被动，职工学习先进经验的热情也会低落。各局厂的领导同志都应注意，切忌这种现象的发生。
