I am very fond of ballad-singing art, and many literary and artistic workers and workers, peasants, and soldiers are also fond of ballad-singing art. It is loved because its form is simple and flexible, and it has a special and intimate national flavor. With a tap of bamboo clappers and a clang of iron pieces, one can start singing. It is very convenient to speak of heroes, sing of models, tell of characters, and narrate stories. This time, during the "August 1st" Army Day, many excellent ballad-singing programs were performed at the literary and artistic competition, proving that this form is suitable for the needs of soldiers and as a tool for propaganda and mobilization in the military.

After listening to the ballad-singing art created by soldiers and military literary and artistic workers, I couldn't help but cheer and was beyond words to describe my admiration and joy. Many ballad-singing works have been written in the past three years, but not many have been performed for a long time, widely circulated, and familiar and loved by the masses. Those formulaic and conceptual inferior goods have long been abandoned by performers and are not welcomed by the audience. How to develop this form further? This has become a problem that the majority of artists and ballad-singing writers urgently need to solve. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, some Quyi (Chinese folk art forms) theaters in Beijing only sold twenty seats a night, reaching the end of their rope. Many audience members also reflected: Is this supposed to be entertainment? It's practically listening to confessions and watching the struggle against embezzlers! The fundamental reason here is that the works cannot capture the audience, the performers have no use for their talents, and the audience feels bored. This time, the soldiers' ballad-singing programs opened up new avenues for ballad-singing art. Audiences and literary and artistic workers praised the good programs after listening to them. I believe that some of the most excellent ones have broken away from the shackles of the old ballad-singing form, abandoned those clichés, and used fresh, lively, bright, and powerful language. I believe that this new style of ballad poetry will not only be popular in the military but will also be loved by the general public, and there will be more and better new works.

The special performance of ballad art is to tell stories and describe heroes and their deeds while speaking and singing. It is more musical than storytelling (including novels) and poetry (including recitation poetry). The accompaniment of musical instruments adds to the touching power. "Reconnaissance Hero Han Qifa," "Lu Xiangyun Fighting Warships," and the "Speaking of the Flood Storage Area in Jingjiang" all took advantage of the special features of ballad art. Even from the beginning of these works, they have made new developments compared to the old ballads and general lyrics, attracting the audience and pointing out the theme from the very beginning.

	One day, after dusk and the sky was dark,
	On the mountain road, the silhouettes of two reconnaissance squads of the Volunteer Army appeared.
		--"Reconnaissance Hero Han Qifa"
	The water of the Jingjiang River rolled with waves.
	For the safety of flood diversion, sluices were built;
	Thousands of years of flood disasters were eradicated,
	The flood storage area happily spoke up as well.
		(Spoken) It said, that's me!
		(Sung) Called flood storage area! Truly generous,
	The people happily praise me.
	I live at the junction of Hubei and Hunan,
	Growing up in the new country of the Mao Zedong era.
		--"Speaking of the Flood Storage Area in Jingjiang"

Such beginnings are very clear and concise. There are people, events, time, and place, and the main topic is pointed out from the very beginning. Those authors who do not understand ballad-singing art, or who fill the space with idle talk and clichés, often write dozens of sentences without getting to the point, and when they finally get to the point, they have no more words to say. For example, there is a ballad called "The Volunteer Army Captured an American Soldier Alive," which has a hundred or so sentences. The author begins by writing, "The American imperialists are too cruel and tyrannical, enslaving the world with power, tearing up agreements unscrupulously, arming Japan to create war. . . ." He writes more than thirty sentences (one-third of the entire text) without getting to the point. How can people not be annoyed by stuffing a large pile of empty, conceptual, and boring nonsense into the audience's ears! More obviously, the same author wrote "Ode to Another Great Construction of the Motherland - Jingjiang Flood Diversion," and began by writing:

	The sun rises, red all over the sky,
	The new China has been established for two years, Chairman Mao leads the people to turn over, production and construction are in full swing. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Sentences like these can be used at the beginning of ballad-singing works that praise the harnessing of the Huai River, the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and the heroic deeds of any model. Many ballad lyrics contain such empty and boring language that is irrelevant to the theme and characters. Comparing such things with the ballad-singing works in the soldiers' literary and artistic competition makes them seem even more pale and weak. The main reason here is that some literary and artistic workers do not understand combat and do not have the experience of battlefield life, yet they insist on writing about heroic figures and combat stories, which is bound to fail. Like this author who praised the Jingjiang flood diversion, he also had no life experience and simply found some materials from newspaper news to start writing, which was also bound to fail. Performing such things to the masses not only fails to achieve the artistic propaganda effect but also reduces the influence of ballad-singing art among the masses and makes them tired of this form.

Some of the good ballad-singing works performed this time were created by soldiers. They themselves are heroic combatants, have enthusiastic combat emotions, and are also observers of battlefield life. They are as familiar with the characters they usually observe, experience, and understand as they are with themselves.

The author of "Reconnaissance Hero Han Qifa," Comrade Liu Peng, is himself an artillery soldier and is familiar with combat life such as marching, climbing mountains, night raids, and attacks. However, he had never been a reconnaissance soldier or captured prisoners. In order to express the story of the reconnaissance hero Han Qifa, he personally made several visits, learned about the time, place, how the reconnaissance was conducted, how the enemy was captured, and other situations. He then added his rich imagination and literary and artistic creation talents to write the initial draft of this excellent work. He also personally read it to Comrade Han Qifa, and after six revisions and many performances among the soldiers, it became the final draft. When he arrived in Beijing, he also sang it to Gao Yuanjun, a Shandong Kuaishu (a form of Chinese comedic storytelling) expert, several times. Comrade Gao Yuanjun also gave him advice on performance techniques. No wonder this program received a warm welcome from the masses during the competition performance. This creative attitude is serious. This spirit of being faithful to art is worth learning from.

"Reconnaissance Hero Han Qifa" is written in the form of Shandong Kuaishu. This form is freer than the form of drum poetry. It is not as constrained by rhymes, but rhymes in a generally similar way. Sometimes it is not a level tone character, but it can also be the next sentence. For example, "At this time, the wind stopped and the clouds cleared, but only a bright light was seen outside the pine forest." The word "light" is a departing tone, but it can also be the next sentence. If it were drum poetry, it would not be easy to sing, but it does not affect the singing of the lyrics in Shandong Kuaishu and instead appears to be more lively. Another feature of this form is that exclamatory words can be added to the lyrics, questions can be asked, answers can be given, and sudden sounds can be described. The example below can be understood:

	Wow! Big and small electric lights encircled the top of the mountain. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
	Ah! What kind of mechanism is this? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
	Thinking of this, he immediately ordered the seventh squad leader:
	(Spoken) "Seventh Squad Leader." "Present"! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
	Hello! Where did the plane come from to drop bombs on me? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
	Oh! It seems that the guerrillas are here. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

I think such a work is a new style of ballad poetry. It can unleash great possibilities in expressing the images of new characters and new heroes. Compared with drum poetry, it is richer in folk colors and closer to colloquial language. With the addition of the performer's body movements, gestures, and expressions, the images of the reconnaissance heroes can be vividly described. It is no accident that this form can quickly and widely spread among the troops. Let's look at how Comrade Liu Peng describes the reconnaissance squad climbing the mountain and the panic of the American soldiers:

	The northwest wind is like a small knife, especially scraping the face,
	The breath freezes into frosted glass on the eyebrows,
	We have to move the thorny bushes uphill;
	Going downhill is like sitting on a rake and sliding down the mountain with a whoosh.
	Just because the comrades are determined to complete the task,
	They are not afraid of the high mountains reaching the sky.
	They walked quickly over the mountains and ridges,
	And climbed to the top of Dinggai Mountain, 580 meters high, in one breath. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
	The more he (referring to the American soldier) thought about it, the more afraid he became,
	He only felt his hair tingling and his spine chilling, like climbing a big centipede. He looked coldly into the distance: Hey! The trees beside the road are moving again, saying they are moving, he is moving more and more. In the past, I was timid and small-minded and saw flowers, but how come the trees are still moving forward today?

Such an imaginative work is in stark contrast to formulaic and conceptual ballad-singing works, adding new vitality to our poetry creation. I don't need to spend much time analyzing and introducing the drum poems written by other military literary and artistic workers one by one, but one point can be made: they have all delved into the combat life of the company, have a clear class position and revolutionary optimism, seriously understand the soldiers' thoughts and feelings, and create together with the soldiers, which is the only way to produce more excellent works. Of course, it is not to say that all the ballads in the military are good. For example, "Heroic Platoon Leader Guo Zhongtian" uses more than 150 sentences in the full text, most of which describe the battle scenes, without portraying the image of the hero Guo Zhongtian. "Guo Zhongtian shouted and killed! The bayonet saw blood and launched a melee, defeating the enemy and occupying the mountain." How did he engage in melee combat? How did he defeat the enemy? How did he capture the mountain? It was not written how Guo Zhongtian showed his ingenuity and bravery in such a battle. There are many other places like this, and I won't give any more examples.

Overall, most of the ballad-singing programs in this competition performance were successful to varying degrees. Compared with past excellent ballad-singing works, they are in no way inferior, and some places are even more artistically infectious. This is the beginning of pushing ballad poetry to a higher stage. It will continue to absorb the characteristics of folk ballads, as well as the characteristics of poetry and music, to further express the combat scenes and the great deeds of the heroes in a more brilliant way. The creative enthusiasm of the military's literary and artistic workers and soldiers with creative talents is like the soldiers' combat enthusiasm, which will always maintain fresh life and combat vitality. They want to speak, sing, chant, dance, and open up the source of art in a strong and courageous, deep and broad way, to create better poems for the soldiers and the Chinese people. We believe that the military's ballad poetry will gradually improve and will achieve new and more perfect achievements with greater efforts.

    谈谈部队的说唱诗歌
    王亚平
    我是很喜爱说唱文艺的，不少文艺工作者和工农兵群众也是喜爱说唱文艺的。它之所以被人喜爱，是因为形式简便灵活，具有一种特别亲切的民族风味。竹板一敲，铁片一响，就唱将起来。说英雄，唱模范，讲人物，述故事，都十分方便。这一次“八一”建军节，文艺竞赛会演中演出了许多优秀的说唱节目，证明这种形式是适合战士们的需要的，是适合于作为部队中的宣传鼓动工具的。
    听了战士和部队文艺工作者创作的说唱文艺，我心里禁不住连声喝采，无法形容我的钦佩与喜悦。三年以来，说唱作品写出了很多，可是演唱得久，流传得广，被广大群众所熟悉与喜爱的，却并不多。那些公式化、概念化的劣等货，早已不被艺人演唱，也不受听众欢迎了。怎样把这种形式发展下去呢？这已经成为广大艺人和说唱文艺写作者所迫切需要解决的问题。在“三反”“五反”运动当中，北京市的曲艺园子，有的一夜只卖二十个座，已到了山穷水尽的地步。不少听众还反映：这那里是听玩艺？简直是听坦白，看斗争贪污分子来了！这里的根本原因，是作品抓不住听众，艺人无用武之地，听众感到了厌倦。这次战士们的说唱节目，给说唱文艺打开了新的道路，观众和文艺工作者听了那些好的节目以后，都赞不绝口。我认为其中几篇最优秀的，已摆脱了旧说唱形式的束缚，抛弃了那些陈词滥调，运用的是新鲜、活泼、明快、有力的语言。我相信这种新体的说唱诗歌，将不但在部队中流行，也将为一般群众所爱好，并且会有更多更好的新作品。
    说唱文艺的特殊性能，是边说边唱地述说故事、描写英雄人物和事迹。它比评书（小说在内）、诗歌（朗诵诗在内）更富有音乐色彩。加上乐器的伴奏，就更增加着感人的力量。“侦察英雄韩起发”
    “卢湘云打兵舰”、荆江“蓄洪区说话”等，都发挥了说唱文艺的特殊性能。单从这些作品的起头来看，也都比旧说唱以及一般唱词有了新的发展，一开唱就能做到吸引观众，点出主题。
    有一天，黄昏已过天色晚，
    山路上，影影绰绰出现了志愿军的两个侦察班。
    ——“侦察英雄韩起发”
    荆江的水，卷着浪花。
    为安全分洪建闸；
    千年的洪水灾害连根拔，
    蓄洪区高兴地也说了话。
    （白）它说我呀！
    （唱）叫蓄洪区！真是肚量大，
    人民高兴地把我夸。
    我住在湖北湖南两交界，
    生长在毛泽东时代的新国家。
    ——“荆江蓄洪区说话”
    这样的起头是很明快的。有人、有事、有时间、有地点，一开唱就指出了正题。那些不懂说唱艺术，或者是以闲话、滥调充塞篇幅的作者，却往往写了几十句，还没有扯到正题上，等刚一说到正题上，他反而没有词儿了。比如有一篇鼓词“志愿军活捉美国兵”，共有百十来句，作者一开头就写“美帝残暴太凶顽，奴役世界用强权，扯碎公约肆无忌惮，武装日本制造战端。……”一直写了三十多句（占全文三分之一）还没有说到正题。把一大堆空洞的、概念化的、枯燥乏味的废话硬朝听众耳朵里塞，怎么能不叫人厌烦呢！更明显的，同样有一个作者写“歌颂祖国的又一伟大建设——荆江分洪”，开始是这样写的：
    太阳一出红满天，
    新中国建立两周年，毛主席领导闹翻身，生产建设热火朝天。…………………………
    像这样的句子，放在歌颂修治淮河，修筑成渝铁路，以及歌颂任何英雄模范事迹等说唱作品的起头都可以使得。不少说唱词都存在着这样空洞乏味、与主题人物无关的语言。拿这样的东西来和战士文艺竞赛中的说唱作品作个比较，就更显得苍白无力了。这里的主要原因，是由于有些文艺工作者不懂得战斗，没有战场的生活体验，硬要去写英雄人物、战斗故事，当然要遭到失败。像这位歌颂荆江分洪的作者，他同样没有生活的体验，单从报纸新闻上找一点材料就动手去写，当然也要遭到失败。拿这样东西向群众演唱，不只起不到艺术的宣传效果，反而在群众中降低了说唱艺术影响，使群众厌倦了这种形式。
    此次演出的好的说唱作品中有些是战士们的创作。他们本身是英勇的战斗者，有热烈的战斗情绪，同时他们也是战场生活的观察者，他们平日所观察、体验、理解到的人物，就像熟悉他自己一样熟悉。
    “侦察英雄韩起发”的作者刘鹏同志自己是炮兵战士，对于行军、爬山、夜袭、攻击等战斗生活，都很熟悉。但他没有当过侦察员，也没有捉过俘虏，为了表现韩起发这个侦察英雄的故事，亲自做了几次访问，了解了时间、地点，如何进行侦察，如何捉获敌人等种种情况，加上他丰富的想像和文艺创作才能，就写成了这篇优秀作品的初稿，又亲自念给韩起发同志听，经过六次修改，在战士们中间多次演唱后，才成了定稿。到了北京，还当着山东快书专家高元钧同志唱了几遍，高元钧同志又在演唱技术上给他提了意见，无怪乎竞赛演出的时候，这个节目受到了群众的热烈欢迎。这样的创作态度，是严肃的。这样忠实于艺术的精神是值得我们学习的。
    “侦察英雄韩起发”是用山东快书的形式写的，这种形式比鼓词的形式自由些。它不太受韵辙的约束，而是押大致相同的韵，有时不是平声字，也可以当下句。比如“这时间风也停来云也散，但只见松林外边白亮亮的光一片。”“片”字是去声，也可以当下句。要是鼓词，唱起来就不合口，山东快书唱起来并不影响词句的唱腔，反而显得更活泼。这种形式又一个特点，是在演唱的词句中，可以加惊叹词，可以问，可以答，可以形容一种突来的声音。看下边的例子就可以明白：
    吓！大小电灯在山头上围了一个圈。…………………………………………
    呀！这是搞的啥机关？…………………………
    想到这里他马上命令七班长：
    （白）“七班长”。“有”！…………………………………
    哈啰！那里来的飞机往我这里扔炸弹？…………………………………………………
    噢！大概是来了游击队，……………………………
    我认为这样的作品，就是一种新的说唱体的诗歌。在表现新人物、新英雄的形象上，它能够发挥很大的可能性。它比起鼓词来，更富有民间色彩，更接近口语。加上演唱者的身段、手势、表情，可以活现地形容出侦察英雄们的形象，这种形式在部队中间能够迅速、广泛地流行决不是偶然的。再看刘鹏同志演唱侦察班爬山、美国兵慌恐的情形：
    西北风像小刀子专刮脸，
    呵气霜雪挂在眼眉上冻成琉璃团，
    上坡得搬着刺棵子；
    下坡好像坐着耙犁哧溜一声下了山。
    只因为同志们完成任务决心大，
    那怕它高山高上天。
    翻山越岭走的快，
    一股劲爬上了五百八十公尺的顶盖山。…………………………………
    他（指美国兵）越思越想越害怕，
    只觉得头发根发悚，脊梁骨冰凉，活像爬上了一条大蚰蜒。他冷眼往远处一看：咦！道旁的树棵子又直动弹，说动弹他越动弹，往日里是我心虚胆小看花眼，怎么今天树棵子还往前搬？
    像这样的富于形象性的作品，和公式化、概念化的说唱作品成了强烈的对比，给我们的诗歌创作增加了新的活力。其他部队文艺工作者所写的鼓词，我不必多费篇幅一一去分析、介绍，但有一点可以提出：他们都深入了连队的战斗生活，具有鲜明的阶级立场和革命的乐观主义精神，认真懂得了战士的思想、情感，并和战士结合在一起进行创作，才能有较优秀的作品产生。自然，不是说部队的说唱都好，如“英雄排长郭忠田”，全文用了一百五十余句，大部分写战斗场面，没有刻划出英雄郭忠田的形象。“郭忠田一声喊杀！刺刀见血展开了肉搏战，杀退敌人占领了高山。”怎样肉搏？怎样杀退了敌人？怎样攻占了高山，郭忠田在这样战斗中怎样表现了机智、勇敢，都没有写出来。其他，像这样的地方还不少，我也不多举例了。
    总起来看，这次竞赛会演中的说唱节目，大部分在不同程度上都是成功的。它和过去优秀的说唱作品比起来，毫无逊色，有些地方却更富有艺术的感染力。这是把说唱诗歌推向更高阶段的开始，它将沿着这个方向，不断地吸收民间说唱的特点，以及诗歌、音乐的特点，来进一步更多光多采地表现战斗的场面和英雄们的伟大事迹。部队的文艺工作者和有创作才能的战士，他们的创作热情，正和战士的战斗热情一样，将永远保持着新鲜的生命与战斗的活力。他们要说，要唱，要歌，要舞，要坚强而勇猛地、深入而广阔地开辟艺术的源泉，为战士、为中国人民创造更好的诗篇。我们相信：部队的说唱诗歌将逐步提高，将依靠更大的努力而获得新的更加完美的成就。
