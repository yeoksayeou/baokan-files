Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 4th: Several organizations, including the International Amateur Swimming Federation, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the International Amateur Basketball Federation, and the International Amateur Athletic Federation, have successively held congresses.

The International Amateur Swimming Federation and FIFA held their respective congresses in Helsinki in late July. Our representative, Sheng Zhibai, attended both congresses and enjoyed all the legitimate rights of a formal representative. Remnants of the Chinese Kuomintang in Taiwan attempted to impersonate Chinese "representatives" and infiltrate the venues but were immediately expelled by the congresses.

The International Amateur Basketball Federation's congress was held on July 21st, 23rd, and August 1st in Helsinki, discussing the membership issue of the basketball organization of the People's Republic of China. Our representative, Sheng Zhibai, attended the congress. The Membership Review Committee established by the congress recommended continuing to recognize the All-China Sports Federation as a member of the federation, exercising its functions within the territory of the People's Republic of China, but simultaneously advocated recognizing the so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation" of the Chinese Kuomintang remnant group in Taiwan, exercising its functions within the so-called "Republic of China" territory. Under the direction of representatives from certain countries, the congress hastily passed the Membership Review Committee's recommendation. Our representative, Sheng Zhibai, issued a statement at the meeting, lodging a solemn protest against the congress's resolution to simultaneously recognize the sports organization of the Taiwan remnant bandits. He pointed out that the Chinese Kuomintang remnant group entrenched in Taiwan, a territory of the People's Republic of China, has long been abandoned by the Chinese people, and its sports organization has no qualification to represent China in international sports federations and must be expelled from all international sports federations. The self-contradictory resolution passed by the congress is a serious error.

The International Amateur Athletic Federation congress was held on the 28th in Helsinki, discussing the membership issue of the athletics organization of the People's Republic of China. The chairman of the meeting, Lord Burghley (UK), president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, said that the Federation Council had recommended recognizing the People's Republic of China as a member state because the Kuomintang organization had now been expelled from the territory inhabited by the vast majority of Chinese people. The president of the U.S. Amateur Athletic Union, Masconi, opposed this recommendation and demanded that the Kuomintang organization be recognized as a member state of the federation. The recently elected president of the International Olympic Committee, Avery Brundage (USA), suggested postponing the decision on this issue.

Representatives from Bulgaria, Pakistan, and Yugoslavia suggested recognizing the People's Republic of China as a member state. The Australian representative put forward a compromise suggestion, advocating allowing the Kuomintang organization to join simultaneously.

The U.S. representative suggested submitting this issue to the next congress (1954) to be held two years later. His suggestion was passed by a vote of 105 to 83. Therefore, the issue of the People's Republic of China's membership in the International Amateur Athletic Federation was unreasonably delayed.

    四个国际运动联合会相继举行代表大会
    我代表声明我国会籍权利不可侵犯
    【新华社赫尔辛基四日电】国际业余游泳联合会、足球协会国际联合会、国际业余篮球联合会和国际业余田径联合会等组织相继举行代表大会。
    国际业余游泳联合会和足球协会国际联合会分别于七月下旬在赫尔辛基举行了代表大会。我国代表盛之白曾出席了这两个代表大会，并享有正式代表应有的一切合法权利。台湾中国国民党残余分子曾妄图冒充中国“代表”混入会场，当即被大会逐出。
    国际业余篮球联合会代表大会于七月二十一日、二十三日和八月一日在赫尔辛基举行，讨论了中华人民共和国篮球组织的会籍问题。我国代表盛之白出席了大会。大会成立的会籍审查委员会建议继续承认中华全国体育总会为联合会会员，在中华人民共和国领土内行使职权，但同时却主张承认台湾中国国民党残余集团的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”，在所谓“中华民国”领土内行使职权。大会在某些国家代表的指使下匆匆通过了会籍审查委员会的建议。我国代表盛之白在会上发表声明，对大会同时承认台湾残匪体育组织的决议提出了严正抗议。他指出：盘踞在中华人民共和国领土台湾的中国国民党残余集团，早已为中国人民所唾弃，它的体育组织没有任何资格代表中国参加国际运动联合会，必须把它从各个国际运动联合会中驱逐出去。大会通过的这一自相矛盾的决议是一个严重的错误。
    国际业余田径联合会代表大会二十八日在赫尔辛基举行，讨论了中华人民共和国田径组织的会籍问题。会议主席、国际业余田径联合会主席柏利勋爵
    （英国）说：联合会理事会曾建议承认中华人民共和国为会员国，因为国民党组织现在已被逐出绝大多数中国人所居住的领土。美国业余田径联合会主席马索尼对这个建议提出反对，他要求承认国民党组织为联合会会员国。最近选出的国际奥林匹克运动会委员会主席布伦代琪（美国）建议延期对此问题作出决定。
    保加利亚、巴基斯坦和南斯拉夫代表建议承认中华人民共和国为会员国。澳大利亚代表提出折衷建议，主张允许国民党组织同时加入。
    美国代表建议把这个问题提交两年以后举行的下次代表大会（一九五四年）解决。他的建议以一百零五票对八十三票获得通过。因此中华人民共和国在国际业余田径联合会的会籍问题就被无理拖延。
