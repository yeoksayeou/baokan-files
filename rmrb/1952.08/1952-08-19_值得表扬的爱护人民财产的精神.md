    Praiseworthy Spirit of Cherishing People's Property
    To the Editor: Shijiazhuang was hit by a rainstorm on July 7th, and the roof (made of eight layers of reed mats) of a warehouse belonging to the Shijiazhuang branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company was blown off by the wind. The branch immediately mobilized all its employees in the Secretariat, Business Section, Planning Section, Accounting Section, etc., a total of more than 50 people, led by Manager Zhao Moqing, to rescue the materials in the rain. In a very short period of time, more than 150 tons of cement in the warehouse were all rescued. However, 47 tons of it had been soaked by the rain. If not handled immediately, it would solidify into lumps. The employees used their brains and came up with the idea of processing the wet cement into cement tiles. The branch manager quickly contacted the municipal government to ask for their assistance. With the introduction of the municipal government, they handed over this batch of wet cement to four cement tile factories, including Xin Jian and Yi He, for processing overnight, so that the 47 tons of cement were not wasted. The spirit of cherishing the people's property shown by the employees of the Shijiazhuang Coal Construction Branch is worthy of learning and commendation.    Gong Xiri

    值得表扬的爱护人民财产的精神
    编辑同志：石家庄一带在七月七日遭受暴风雨侵袭，中国煤业建筑器材公司石家庄支公司一座仓库的屋顶（八层芦席盖成）被风吹掉。该支公司马上动员秘书室、业务股、计划股、会计股等全体职工共五十多人，由赵墨卿经理带领，冒雨抢救。在很短时间内，就把库内一百五十多吨洋灰全部抢出。但其中有四十七吨已被大雨淋湿，如不立刻处理，就会凝结成块。职工们开动脑筋，想出了把淋湿的洋灰加工为洋灰瓦的办法，支公司经理即迅速向市政府联系，请他们协助。经市政府介绍，他们把这批淋湿了的洋灰交新建、义和等四家洋灰瓦厂，连夜进行加工，使这四十七吨洋灰没有被糟踏。石家庄煤建支公司职工们这种爱护人民财产的精神是值得学习和表扬的。    弓系日
