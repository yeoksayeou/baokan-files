On the eve of "August 1st" [Army Day], Zhang Jihui, Zhao Baotong, and Liu Yuti, heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force, arrived in Beijing.

At the East Railway Station, when the Young Pioneers who were presenting flowers recognized the heroic uncles they had been longing to see day and night and rushed forward to embrace them, the welcoming crowd was immediately electrified, cheering, "Ah, Zhang Jihui!" "Zhao Baotong!" "Liu Yuti!" The crowd surged towards them, showering them with flowers. Everyone—workers, students, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, university professors, and government cadres—squeezed in to shake hands and embrace them. They barely managed to get out of the station before the young workers and students lifted them up and carried them, the cheering crowd surrounding them for a long time. When they got into the car, the young people grabbed their arms from outside the car windows, running alongside their car all the way. It took them two and a half hours to get from the East Railway Station to their residence.

The people's love for these air force heroes is not only manifested in such welcoming occasions. Because these heroes represented the Chinese people in slapping the American aggressors hard in the face of all the world's people, killing American "ace pilots," and shooting down and damaging many American planes, bringing a "gloomy atmosphere to the future" of the American air force (as stated by Weyland, Commander of the U.S. Far East Air Force); also because they avenged the orphans and mothers of Korea, and avenged the burning villages of Korea; therefore, when their battle deeds spread to the motherland, from every corner of the motherland, from Rongcheng Bay in the east to Xinjiang in the west, from Hainan Island in the south to Heilongjiang in the north, piles and piles of letters of appreciation poured in to our heroes. There were drawings of big airplanes made by the tender little hands of kindergarten children, crooked little words written by mothers who had just learned to write using the quick literacy method, the sturdy handwriting of workers, and the neat calligraphy of teachers. The people unanimously thanked the heroes for protecting their peaceful and happy lives. Students thanked the heroes for protecting their quiet classrooms, mothers thanked them for letting their babies sleep peacefully, and white-haired professors thanked them for protecting their laboratories. Workers in Siping drew pictures of Zhao Baotong's deeds and sent them to him, store employees reported the victory of the "Five-Anti" campaign to him, and model workers reported their increased production achievements and put forward new guarantees. Many junior and senior high school students graduating this year expressed their desire to learn from the heroes' spirit of serving the people and to joyfully and unconditionally obey the needs of the motherland and the assignments of the organization. Wang Hongxi, a student at Lingbao Normal School in Henan, wrote to Zhao Baotong, saying that whenever his thoughts were confused, as long as he thought of the heroes of the people of the motherland fighting bravely in the skies over Korea, his heart would brighten, and his courage to fight against mistakes and shortcomings would increase. A dentist in Nanjing also frankly wrote to Zhang Jihui that he used to be very selfish and only considered his personal interests in his work; but when he saw the report that Zhang Jihui used his own plane to ram the enemy planes after firing all his bullets, he asked himself: The heroes are fighting so selflessly in the front to protect you, but you are still single-mindedly planning for yourself in the rear, can you be worthy of the heroes? He assured Zhang Jihui that he would definitely be determined to transform his thinking, wash away the stains on his body, and serve the people wholeheartedly. A young member of the Communist Youth League who worked in finance in a government agency was originally unsettled in his job, but when he thought of Zhang Jihui and Zhao Baotong fighting wholeheartedly for the motherland and fearlessly, he happily put down his burden and settled down to participate in the economic construction of the new China.

What moved them most were the letters and gifts from many children. Xiao Chaowen, a Young Pioneer in Guizhou, sent his red scarf to Zhang Jihui, writing in his letter: "I am a Young Pioneer, and what I respect, cherish, and love most is that corner of the national flag—my red scarf. It flutters on my chest every day, encouraging me to study hard and ordering me to advance bravely. Under its enthusiastic encouragement and glorious command, my grades in each exam are all A." Now, he sends the red scarf that he cannot leave day and night to his heroic uncle. The child enthusiastically hopes: "Let the red flag flutter on the hero's chest, let it inspire you to advance more bravely, from one victory to another!" The heroes' actions have had a profound impact on the cultivation of children's excellent qualities. Hou Jingxian, a Young Pioneer from Sifabu Street Elementary School in Beijing, enthusiastically expressed in a letter to Liu Yuti: "Uncle, rest assured, I want to be a good child of Chairman Mao now, and a good soldier of Chairman Mao in the future, to defend the great motherland, defend Chairman Mao, and defend the heroic you. Uncle! I want to be ready at all times!" This lofty ideal of the children is precisely inspired by the achievements of the heroes. The children look to the future, telling their heroic uncles innocently, "We will be writers, scientists, engineers, pilots, and tractor drivers in the future..." They wrote in their letters: "In the positions of national construction, there will be many children wearing red scarves who have seen you." Zhang Lianying, a Young Pioneer in the second grade of Beijing May 1st Girls' Middle School, put the People's Daily and the China Youth Daily, which published the deeds of Zhao Baotong, on her desk. Every day after school, she first goes to the desk to take a look and carefully checks her study for the day. Now her grades in every subject are above ninety.

The people's particularly warm love and care for the heroes of the Volunteer Army Air Force is understandable. This reflects the people's deep concern for the cause of modern national defense construction. The Chinese people have painful memories of being massacred and invaded by imperialist aerial bandits in the past. Wang Minggao, a citizen of Nanjing, wrote to Zhao Baotong: "I remember that after the liberation of Nanjing in 1949, whenever we heard the sound of the engines of the American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes, the sound of bomb explosions, and the sound of machine gun fire, how much we hated it in our hearts; at the same time, how much we hoped and hoped that an air force would appear in our new China, grow and strengthen quickly, and punish those hateful American aerial bandits heartily. Now, the hoped-for thing has finally been realized. You have beaten the American imperialists so happily. With air force heroes like you in the motherland, we are proud of it!"

Regarding the trust and love of the people of the motherland for them, our heroes Zhang Jihui, Zhao Baotong, and Liu Yuti have firmly stated that they must respond to the people with new victories. Zhao Baotong told me that when they set off for Beijing, Wang Chuan, the representative of the pilots who saw them off, had said that they should respond to the expectations of the people of the motherland with new victories. "In the past few days," he said with a smile, "the team has already won new victories, and my wingman Comrade Fan Wanxin has already achieved a record of shooting down five enemy planes." We believe that they will definitely not disappoint the ardent expectations of the people of the motherland, and they will create new and more brilliant victories.

    人民热爱志愿军空军英雄
    金凤
    在“八一”的前夕，中国人民志愿军空军英雄张积慧、赵宝桐、刘玉堤到了北京。
    在东车站，当献花的少年儿童队员发现了他们日夜盼念着的英雄叔叔，拥上去抱住他们的时候，欢迎的人群立时震动起来，欢呼起来：“呵，张积慧”！“赵宝桐”！“刘玉堤”！人群拥向他们，鲜花投向他们。所有的人—工人、学生、解放军代表、大学教授、机关干部都挤着和他们握手、拥抱。他们好不容易才走出车站，青年工人、学生们又把他们抬了起来，欢呼的人群围着他们久久不散。当他们上了汽车，青年们从车窗外拉住他们的手臂，一路跟着他们的汽车跑。他们从东车站到驻地，足足走了两个半钟头。
    人民对于这些空军英雄的热爱，并不只是表现在这种欢迎的场合。由于这些英雄代表中国人民在全世界人民面前重重地打了美国侵略者的耳光，击毙了美国的“王牌飞行员”，击落、击伤了许多架美国飞机，给美国空军的前途“带来一片黯淡气氛”
    （美国远东空军司令威兰语）；也由于他们为朝鲜的孤儿和母亲复了仇，为朝鲜的燃烧的村庄复了仇；因此，当他们的战斗事迹传到祖国的时候，从祖国的各个角落，东到荣成湾、西到新疆、南到海南岛、北到黑龙江，成堆成堆的慰问信投向我们的英雄。这里有幼儿园儿童稚嫩的小手画的大飞机，有才用速成识字法学会写字的母亲写的歪歪斜斜的小字，有粗壮的工人笔迹，也有教师们端正的字画。人民一致感谢着英雄保卫了他们和平幸福的生活。学生们感谢英雄们保卫了他们安静的课堂，母亲们感谢他们让婴孩安睡，白发的教授感谢他们保卫了他的实验室。四平的工人把赵宝桐的事迹画成图画寄给他，店员工人向他报告“五反”胜利的消息，生产模范报告着自己的增产成绩，并提出新的保证。许多今年毕业的初中和高中学生都表示要学习英雄们为人民服务的精神，愉快地无条件地服从祖国的需要和组织的分配。河南灵宝师范学校学生王鸿喜写信告诉赵宝桐说，每当自己的思想搞不通的时候，只要一想到在朝鲜上空奋勇作战的祖国人民的英雄，自己的心胸就开朗起来，和错误、缺点作斗争的勇气也增强了。南京一个牙科医师也坦白地写信告诉张积慧，他过去很自私自利，工作中一贯只考虑个人利益；但当他看到张积慧打完子弹时用自己的飞机去撞敌人飞机的报导，他反问自己：英雄们在前方为了保卫你而这样忘我地战斗，你在后方还一心一意替自己打算，你对得起英雄们吗？他向张积慧保证：一定要下决心改造思想，洗尽身上的污点，全心全意为人民服务。一个在机关做财经工作的青年团员原来不安心工作，可是一想到张积慧和赵宝桐他们全心全意为祖国奋不顾身的战斗的时候，就愉快地放下了包袱，安心地参加新中国的经济建设工作。
    最使他们感动的是许多儿童们的来信和礼物。贵州一个少年儿童队员萧朝文把自己的红领巾送给张积慧，信里写道：“我是一个少年儿童队员，我最尊敬、最宝贵、最爱护的就是那国旗的一角—我的红领巾。她天天飘在我的胸前，她鼓励我努力学习，她命令我勇猛前进。在她热情的鼓励和光荣的命令下，我每期的考试成绩都在甲等”。现在，他把他朝夕不能离开的红领巾送给英雄叔叔。孩子热情地希望着：“让红旗飘扬在英雄的胸前，让她鼓舞你更英勇地前进，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利！”英雄们的行为在培养儿童的优秀品质中发生了深刻影响。北京司法部街小学的一个少年儿童队员侯景贤在写给刘玉堤的信里热情地表示着：“叔叔您放心，我现在要做毛主席的好儿童，将来要做毛主席的好战士，保卫伟大的祖国，保卫毛主席，保卫英雄的您。叔叔！我要时刻准备着！”孩子们这种崇高的理想，正是从英雄们的业绩得到启示的。孩子们眼睛望着明天，天真地告诉他们的英雄叔叔“我们将来要当文学家、科学家、工程师、飞行员和拖拉机手……”他们写信说：“在祖国建设的岗位上，将有许多是见过您的带着红领巾的孩子们。”北京五一女中初二的少年儿童队队员张连英把登载着赵宝桐事迹的人民日报和中国青年报压在书桌上。每天放学回家，先到书桌上看看，并且认真地检查自己一天的学习。现在她每科考试的成绩都在九十分以上。
    人民这样特别热烈地爱护志愿军空军英雄是可以理解的。这反映着人民对于现代化国防建设事业的深切关怀。中国人民过去有着被帝国主义空中强盗屠杀、侵略的惨痛记忆。南京的市民王鸣皋写信给赵宝桐说：“记得在一九四九年南京解放以后，每逢听到美国制造的蒋匪飞机的马达声，炸弹的爆炸声和机枪的扫射声，我们的心里多么恨呀；同时又多么盼望、盼望我们新中国会出现空军，快快生长、壮大，痛痛快快地惩罚那些可恨的美国空中强盗。如今，盼望的事终于实现了。您们把美帝国主义打得太痛快了。祖国有了你们这样的空军英雄，我们引以为荣！”
    对于祖国人民对他们的信赖和热爱，我们的英雄张积慧、赵宝桐和刘玉堤都坚决表示一定要以新的胜利来回答人民。赵宝桐告诉我，在他们动身来北京的时候，欢送他们的飞行员代表王川曾说过，要以新的胜利来回答祖国人民对他们的期望。“最近几天，”他微笑着说：“队伍已经打了新的胜仗，我的僚机范万辛同志已经有了打落五架敌机的纪录。”我们相信他们一定不会辜负祖国人民对他们的热烈期望，他们会创造出新的更辉煌的胜利。”
