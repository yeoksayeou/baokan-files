    Learning from "Study" Magazine's Method of Using Self-Criticism to Improve Work
    Editor: The "Study" magazine published an article titled "Our Self-Examination" in its fifth issue of 1952, which conducted a profound self-criticism of the magazine's past errors of dogmatism and Party jargon. This is a very meaningful thing.
    Based on my personal experience reading "Study" magazine, although I had previously felt that some articles in the magazine could not solve the actual problems existing in work and study, I could never find the reason. I even sometimes blamed myself for not reading carefully enough. Only after reading "Our Self-Examination" did I realize that this was due to some authors committing the error of "one-sidedness, without concrete analysis and research."
    "Our Self-Examination" not only pointed out the errors in some articles published by the magazine, but also used concrete examples to help readers further understand and apply dialectics. Therefore, I believe that this kind of self-criticism is worth promoting. I hope that other newspapers and periodicals can adopt this method, earnestly examine their own work, and play a greater role in the great theoretical study movement.　　　　Yuan Yueyun

    学习“学习”杂志用自我批评改进工作的方法
    编辑同志：“学习”杂志一九五二年第五期发表了“我们的检讨”一文，对于该刊过去所犯的教条主义和党八股作风的错误，进行了深刻的自我批评。这是一件很有意义的事。
    就我个人阅读“学习”杂志的经验来说，以前我虽也曾感到该刊某些文章不能解决工作和学习中实际存在的问题，但始终找不出原因，有时甚至埋怨自己阅读得不够用心。直到读了“我们的检讨”以后，我才认识到这原是由于某些作者犯了“片面性，不做具体分析研究”的原故。
    “我们的检讨”不但指出了该刊所发表的某些文章的错误所在，并且以具体的事例帮助读者进一步理解和运用辩证法。所以，我认为这种自我批评是值得推广的。希望其他报纸期刊都能采用这个方法，认真地检查自己的工作，使自己在伟大的理论学习运动中，发挥更大的作用。　　　　袁岳云
