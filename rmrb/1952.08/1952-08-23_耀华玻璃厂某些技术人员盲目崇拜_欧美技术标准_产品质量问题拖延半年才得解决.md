Yaohua Glass Factory's Some Technicians Blindly崇拜 "European and American Technical Standards"
Product Quality Issues Delayed for Six Months Before Being Resolved

To the Editor: Since September of last year, the Yaohua Glass Factory in Qinhuangdao has experienced serious bubble issues in its products. Due to erroneous technical guidance, this problem was delayed for six months before being resolved.

Before Liberation, the glass furnace at Yaohua Glass Factory averaged less than 0.7 tons of molten material per square meter; after Liberation, the molten material volume increased to about one ton. As a result, the old operating methods could not adapt to the new needs, leading to poor melting and a large number of air bubbles in the finished glass.

To solve this problem, the factory's technicians also conducted some research. However, the two chief engineers who were successively responsible for the research both relied on the temperature standards and hot spot distribution methods left by the Belgians and Japanese (Note: This factory was founded in 1922 and was jointly operated by Chinese and Belgian private merchants until 1935. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese took over the factory's production). They mistakenly believed that "poor melting was due to insufficient heat" and placed the highest temperature point at the rear of the furnace, continuing to heat it. From September of last year to mid-February of this year, the bubbles not only did not decrease but increased, and glass production also decreased by 60,000 crates. The furnace crown was also burned out twice due to excessive temperature. It is estimated that the reduction in glass production caused a loss of more than 6 billion yuan to the country.

When high-temperature operation methods proved ineffective, the technicians attributed the cause to objective factors, saying: "The furnace is too old" and "The amount of molten material exceeds the melting capacity of the furnace." During this period, the workers put forward more than 30 suggestions, such as moving the high-temperature point forward. Because these opinions did not conform to the technicians' "theory" and the factory's "historical operating procedures" of the past 30 years, they were all locked in cabinets.

On February 27th, Soviet experts came to the Yaohua Glass Factory. After in-depth investigation and research, they proposed a low-temperature treatment method of moving the high-temperature point forward; and suggested temporarily reducing production based on the furnace's melting conditions. These opinions were basically the same as some of the workers' suggestions in the past. However, the factory's technicians said that the former was "repeating" their "failed old road," and the latter would "affect their completion of production tasks," and refused to accept them. After repeated explanations by the Soviet experts, they reluctantly implemented the suggestions.

By the morning of March 2nd, the bubbles had significantly decreased. However, the technicians did not admit that this was the result of implementing the experts' opinions. They then arbitrarily moved the high-temperature point to the rear of the furnace and continued to heat it. On the 4th, personnel from the Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry were sent to the factory to supervise their implementation of the experts' opinions. On the 8th, the bubbles were reduced. On the 13th, all the glass produced met the standards, and the output exceeded the factory's original record.

From this incident, it can be seen that if the technicians do not break the old ideas of "European and American technical standards," they cannot correctly accept the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Why do they worship "European and American technical standards" and not believe in the advanced experience of the Soviet Union? Because they do not understand that all science and technology can only be fully developed and created in socialist countries. They do not understand that the science and technology of the Soviet Union have surpassed the decadent capitalist countries. Therefore, technicians must thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology and the old idea of worshiping European and American technology in order to correctly accept advanced Soviet experience and better build our motherland.

    耀华玻璃厂某些技术人员盲目崇拜“欧美技术标准”
    产品质量问题拖延半年才得解决
    编辑同志：秦皇岛市耀华玻璃厂从去年九月以来，产品发生严重的带泡现象。并因技术指导错误，使这个问题拖延了半年才得解决。
    解放前，耀华玻璃厂的玻璃大窑每平方公尺面积，平均溶料不足零点七吨；解放后，溶料量提高到一吨左右。这样，旧的操作方法不能适应新的需要，即发生溶化不良现象，成品玻璃中含有大量气泡。
    为了解决这个问题，该厂技术人员也作了一些研究工作。但先后负责研究的两个总工程师，都是根据比利时人和日本人（按：这个厂是一九二二年创办的，至一九三五年期间，曾由中国和比利时私商合办。抗日战争时，日本人曾接管过这个厂的生产）留下的温度标准和热点分布方法来研究的。他们错误地认为“溶解不好是因为热度不够”，便把最高温点放在大窑后部，继续加热。从去年九月一直到今年二月中旬，气泡不但没有减少，反而增多了，玻璃产量也减少了六万箱。大窑?顶，也因为温度太高烧坏了两次。因玻璃减产，估计前后给国家造成的损失达六十多亿元。
    当高温操作方法不生效时，技术人员就把原因推到客观上去，说是：“窑太老了”，“熔料量超过了窑的熔化能力。”在这期间，工人们曾提出了三十多条把高温点前移等建议。因为这些意见不合技术人员的“理论”和该厂建厂三十年来的“历史操作规程”，全部被锁在柜子里了。
    二月二十七日，苏联专家来到了耀华玻璃厂，经过深入调查研究，提出了高温点前移的低温处理方法；并根据大窑溶料情况，主张暂时降低产量。这些意见基本上和过去工人的一些建议是一样的。但该厂技术人员说：前者是“重复”他们“失败的老路”，后者会“影响他们完成生产任务”，拒不接受。经苏联专家反复说明理由后，他们才勉强执行。
    到三月二日早晨，气泡已显著减少。但技术人员不承认这是执行专家意见的结果，他们却又擅自把高温点移到大窑后部，并继续加热。四日，中央人民政府重工业部派人到厂监督他们执行专家意见，八日，气泡才减少了。十三日产的玻璃就全部合乎规格了，产量也超过了该厂原有的纪录。
    从这件事可以看出，技术人员如果不打破“欧美技术标准”的旧观点，他们是不能正确地接受苏联的先进经验的。他们为什么要崇拜“欧美技术标准”而不相信苏联的先进经验呢？因为他们还不了解一切科学和技术，只有在社会主义国家里，才能得到充分的发挥和创造。他们不了解苏联的科学和技术已超过了腐朽的资本主义国家。因此，技术人员必须彻底批判资产阶级思想和崇拜欧美技术的旧观点，才能正确地接受苏联先进经验，才能更好地来建设我们的祖国。林中鹞
