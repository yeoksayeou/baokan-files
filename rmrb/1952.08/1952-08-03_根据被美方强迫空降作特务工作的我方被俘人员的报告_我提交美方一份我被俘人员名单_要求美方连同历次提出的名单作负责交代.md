Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 2nd: General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of our side in the Korean armistice negotiations, sent a letter to the other side on August 2nd, demanding that the other side account for the whereabouts of 238 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. According to reports from our captured personnel who were forcibly recruited by the other side to work as spies and air-dropped into our area, these 238 of our personnel have been held as prisoners of war by the other side, but these personnel have never been included in the list of prisoners of war submitted by the other side. General Nam Il pointed out: The other side’s serious illegal act of forcing prisoners of war to work as spies cannot be concealed by the other side’s self-contradictory lies about the escape of our captured personnel. The other side must provide an honest and responsible account of the whereabouts of our captured personnel that we have requested information on. The full text of General Nam Il's letter to the other side is as follows:

To Major General Harrison, Chief Delegate of the United Nations Command Delegation:

	(1) Enclosed is a list of 238 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. According to reports from our captured personnel who were forcibly recruited by your side to work as spies and air-dropped into our area, these 238 of our personnel have been held as prisoners of war by your side, but these personnel have never been included in the list of prisoners of war submitted by your side. I demand that your side provide an honest and responsible account of the whereabouts of these our captured personnel.

	(2) Our side submitted a list of 203 of our captured personnel on July 1, 1952, a list of 4,391 of our captured personnel on July 14th, a list of 610 of our captured personnel on July 20th, a list of 101 of our captured personnel on July 21st, and today we submit another list of 238 of our captured personnel. In total, this includes 5,543 of our captured personnel. Your side has not given any account for these our captured personnel to this day.

	(3) It must also be pointed out that your side bears full responsibility for the serious violation of international law by your side in forcing prisoners of war to work as spies. This cannot be concealed by your side’s self-contradictory lies about the escape of our captured personnel. Your side should provide an honest and responsible account of the whereabouts of our captured personnel that we have requested information on without delay.

General Nam Il,
Chief Delegate of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation

    根据被美方强迫空降作特务工作的我方被俘人员的报告
    我提交美方一份我被俘人员名单
    要求美方连同历次提出的名单作负责交代
    【新华社开城二日电】朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军在八月二日致函对方，要求对方交代二百三十八名中国人民志愿军被俘人员的下落。根据被对方强迫作特务工作空降到我方地区的我方被俘人员的报告，这二百三十八名我方人员已被对方收容为战俘，但对方历次交来的战俘名单中从未包括这些人员。南日将军指出：对方强迫战俘作特务工作的严重非法行为，决非对方自相矛盾地谎称我方被俘人员逃亡的伎俩所能掩饰。对方必须对我方历次提出查询的我方被俘人员作出诚实与负责的交代。南日将军致对方信件全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊少将：
    （一）兹将二百三十八名中国人民志愿军被俘人员的名单随函提交你方。根据空降到我方地区被你方强迫作特务工作的我方被俘人员的报告，这二百三十八名我方人员已为你方收容为战俘，但这些人员却从未列入你方交来的战俘名单之中，我要求你方对于这些我方被俘人员的下落作诚实与负责的交代。
    （二）我方在一九五二年七月一日提交二百零三名我方被俘人员名单，七月十四日提交四千三百九十一名我方被俘人员名单，七月二十日提交六百零十名我方被俘人员名单，七月二十一日提交一百零一名我方被俘人员名单，今天又提交二百三十八名我方被俘人员名单。总共包括五千五百四十三名我方被俘人员，对于这些我方被俘人员，你方至今仍未作过任何交代。
    （三）必须同时指出，对于你方强迫战俘作特务工作的严重违反国际法的行为，你方负有完全的责任。这决非你方自相矛盾地谎称我方被俘人员逃亡的伎俩所能掩饰的。对于我方历次提出的我方被俘人员的下落，你方应该毫不迟延地作出诚实与负责的交代。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军
    代表团首席代表南日将军
    一九五二年八月二日
    双方参谋人员会议在八月二日继续讨论停战协定草案的文字细节问题。
