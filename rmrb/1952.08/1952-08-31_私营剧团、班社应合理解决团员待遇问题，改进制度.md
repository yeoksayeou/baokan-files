    Private Opera Troupes and Companies Should Reasonably Resolve the Issue of Performers' Benefits and Improve Systems

    Editor's Note: In mid-June, we received a letter from reader Zhang Guobin, reflecting that the Beijing private Xin Sheng Ping Opera Troupe harshly exploited its members, disregarded their lives, and had not established a democratic management system. After this newspaper contacted the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Cultural Affairs Management Office and the Beijing Ping Opera Association, the problem has been preliminarily resolved. The person in charge of the Xin Sheng Ping Opera Troupe made a self-criticism, benefits have been adjusted, and internal systems have been improved. Some private opera troupes in various regions have relatively reasonable internal organizations, while others have situations similar to those of the Xin Sheng Ping Opera Troupe and should also be improved.

    Reader Zhang Guobin's Letter

    Comrade Editor: In June, the Beijing Xin Sheng Ping Opera Troupe came to Shijingshan to perform. Because the members of the troupe lived in the same courtyard as me, I learned about some problems within the troupe. The main problem is that the general actors are still exploited and oppressed by the Wu Peixia family. The disparity between the lives of general actors and leading actors is huge. The troupe is filled with a feudal autocratic atmosphere, and a democratic management system has not been established.

    For example, regarding the actors' salaries, the Wu Peixia family of three (father and daughters) together receive about 2.5 million yuan per day in salary, enough for them to eat and drink extravagantly. The salaries of other actors, however, are very low, with the lowest being only 6,000 yuan per day. Moreover, the salary is distributed according to business performance, and sometimes the stipulated amount cannot be fully paid, but only 30% or 40%. Wu's family's 40% can amount to 100,000 yuan, while 40% of 6,000 yuan is only 2,400 yuan, which is not enough to even buy cornbread and plain water.

    The Wu Peixia family is very backward in thinking and looks down on the general members, thinking that they themselves are famous performers and that the masses rely on them for food. No democratic system has been established within the troupe. The Wu family members have the freedom to scold people and do not listen to the opinions of the masses, often saying, "Whoever doesn't want to work can leave." No mess hall is established within the troupe, and the members do not have time to devote themselves to their professional skills, which affects the business. There are also family members of servicemen in the troupe, who are not given preferential treatment and care. If an actor is sick and asks for leave, their salary is suspended, making life even more problematic.

    I hope that relevant departments will thoroughly investigate the situation of the Xin Sheng Ping Opera Troupe and urge them to improve. I am afraid that other private opera troupes also have similar situations, which should attract the general attention of relevant departments in various regions.

    Reply from the Beijing Ping Opera Association

    Comrade Editor: Regarding the problem of the Xin Sheng Ping Opera Troupe, we have already received opinions from the troupe's actors and are conducting investigation and research. Recently, we received the reader's letter forwarded by you, and we think his opinion is very valuable. We have summoned the person in charge of the troupe and all members of the troupe committee to a meeting at the association, gave appropriate criticism to the troupe leader Wu Peixia, and solicited the opinions of the troupe committee and actor representatives on how to deal with the problem. Everyone advocated implementing a democratic salary assessment method and demanded that troupe leader Wu Peixia make a self-criticism and correct her attitude towards the troupe members. Wu Peixia admitted her mistakes and was willing to correct them. Regarding the salary issue, Wu Peixia supported the democratic salary assessment method. She wrote a written self-criticism to our association, guaranteeing to seek welfare for the masses and make everyone's benefits fair and reasonable. The salary assessment work is now underway.

    Reply from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Management Office

    Comrade Editor: We received a letter forwarded by you from Comrade Zhang Guobin, expressing his opinions on the internal system of the Xin Sheng Ping Opera Troupe. Before receiving the letter, we were helping them. Now the troupe has made preliminary improvements in its system and plans to continue to help them establish a fair and reasonable system and improve the content of the performance program. We attach great importance to Comrade Zhang Guobin's opinion, which can serve as reference material for us to educate private opera troupes. Enclosed is a self-criticism letter from Wu Peixia of the Xin Sheng Ping Opera Troupe.

    Wu Peixia's Self-Criticism Letter

    Responsible comrades of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Management Office: We are very grateful to receive the letter forwarded by you from Comrade Zhang Guobin giving opinions to our troupe. I, Yanxia, and my father have made self-criticisms.

    My cultural and political level is very low, which is why problems like today have occurred. I will definitely correct my work style in the future, humbly accept the opinions of the masses, and lead the work of the troupe well.

    Our troupe was established in August 1951. At that time, the share out was based on box office receipts from the front stage; after March of this year, it was changed to a share system based on the business performance, still distributing shares according to the list of the box office receipts. My share is the highest, at 112,000 yuan, and the lowest guaranteed share is 6,000 yuan. I have not done a good job in the administrative work of the troupe. In the future, I will definitely study hard, accept the opinions of the masses, and no longer make similar mistakes, and wholeheartedly serve the masses.

### 私营剧团、班社应合理解决团员待遇问题，改进制度

    私营剧团、班社应合理解决团员待遇问题，改进制度
    编者按：六月中旬我们接到读者张国彬来信，反映北京私营新生评剧团苛刻剥削团员、不顾团员生活、没有建立民主管理制度等情况。经本报分别与北京市人民政府文化事业管理处及北京市评剧公会联系后，这个问题已获得初步解决。新生评剧团负责人作了检讨，待遇已经调整，内部制度有了改进。各地私营剧团有一部分内部组织是比较合理的，也有一部分存在着与新生评剧团类似的情况，也应该加以改进。
    读者张国彬来信
    编辑同志：六月间北京新生评剧团到石景山来演出，因为该团团员和我住在一个院内，所以了解了他们团内的一些问题。主要是一般演员仍然受团长吴佩霞一家人的剥削和压迫，一般演员和主要演员苦乐悬殊，团内充满了封建专制气氛，没有建立民主管理制度。
    例如演员的工资，吴佩霞一家父女三人每天合领工资二十五万元左右，可以大吃大喝；其他演员的工资却非常低，最低的每天只六千元。而且工资是按照营业情况来分的，有时不能按规定数目十足支领，只能分三、四成。吴家的四成可有十万元，六千元的四成则只有二千四百元了，吃窝头喝白水也不够。
    吴佩霞一家人思想都很落后，轻视一般团员，以为他们自己是名角，群众靠他们吃饭。团内没有建立民主制度，吴家的人有骂人的自由，不听群众意见，常说“谁不愿干谁走”。团内也不成立伙食团，团员们无暇精研业务，以致影响营业。团内有军属，也不加以优待和照顾，演员病了告假就停发工资，生活更成问题。
    希望有关部门彻底调查新生评剧团的情况，促其改进。恐怕其他私营剧团也有类似情况，这是应该引起各地有关主管部门普遍注意的问题。
    张国彬
    北京市评剧公会复信
    编辑同志：关于新生评剧团问题，我们已经接到过该团演员们的意见，正在进行了解和研究。最近又接到你们转来的读者来信，觉得他的意见很宝贵。我们已经召集过该团负责人及团委会全体人员在公会开会，对团长吴佩霞给予了适当的批评，并征求团委和演员代表们对问题处理的意见，大家主张实行民主评薪办法，要求团长吴佩霞作检讨，纠正对团员们的态度。吴佩霞承认了错误，愿意纠正自己的错误。对于薪金问题，吴佩霞拥护民主评薪的办法。她给我会写了书面检讨来，保证给群众谋福利，使大家的待遇公平合理，现在正进行评薪工作。
  　北京市评剧公会
    北京市人民政府
    文化事业管理处复信
    编辑同志：你们转来读者张国彬同志来信一件，对新生评剧团内部制度提出意见。在未接信前，我们正在帮助他们，现在该团在制度上已有初步改进，并拟继续帮助他们建立公平合理的制度，并改进演出节目的内容。我们很重视张国彬同志的意见，这可以作为我们对私营班社进行教育的参考材料。附去新生评剧团吴佩霞检讨信一件。
    北京市人民政府文化事业管理处
    吴佩霞的检讨信
    北京市人民政府文化事业管理处负责同志：我团接到你们转来张国彬同志给我团提意见的信件，很是感谢，我自己、燕霞和我父亲已作了检讨。
    我的文化、政治水平很低，才发生了今天这样的问题。我以后一定改正作风，虚心接受群众意见，好好领导团的工作。
    我团在一九五一年八月成立，那时是由前台开包银；今年三月以后才改为份金制，照营业情况分份金，仍按包银单开份。我的份金最高，是十一万二千元，最低的底包是六千元。我没有把团内的行政工作搞好，今后一定努力学习，接受群众的意见，不再犯类似错误，诚心诚意为群众服务。
    新生评剧团  吴佩霞
