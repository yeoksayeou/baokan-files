Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 23rd: William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, on the eve of the 7th anniversary of Korea's liberation on August 15th, called on the American people to rise up and demand an immediate armistice in Korea and oppose the U.S. government's conspiracy to sabotage the armistice negotiations. In a special article published on the front page of the New York "Daily Worker," Foster wrote: "The basis for an armistice has long been established in the Panmunjom negotiations, and under no circumstances should warmongers and imperialists be allowed to use the deadlock on the prisoner of war issue as a pretext to continue and expand the war."

Foster said: "The responsibility for continuing the war undoubtedly rests with the Washington political and military leaders who hide behind the hypocritical signboard of the United Nations. They are the ones who, from the beginning, planned to wage war while conducting armistice negotiations. They are the ones who frequently launch continuous ground wars, naval bombardments, and especially large-scale and fierce air raids."

Foster pointed out that the U.S. military leaders and the Truman government adopted this extremely provocative policy of continuing the war because they did not want to stop the war at all. They knew that a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue would be a heavy blow to their lies of creating war hysteria and would ease the tense world political situation, which was the last thing the Wall Street profiteering war merchants wanted.

Foster said: The vast majority of the American people hate the Korean War and sincerely hope for peace in Korea and tranquility in the world. This is reflected in recent poll results, which show that the vast majority of Americans believe the Korean War is "completely useless." Despite the military's claim that the United States is in a state of "national emergency," workers are determined to strike, and the people oppose high taxes and high prices. In this regard, our party and other progressive Americans who oppose the imperialist war in Korea represent the true spirit and interests of the American people.

Foster concluded: "The American leaders are trying to use the method of repeatedly extending the adjournment of the negotiation meetings to break down the entire negotiations. This is absolutely not permissible."

    福斯特号召美国人民起来要求在朝鲜停战
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特，在“八·一五”朝鲜解放七周年前夕号召美国人民起来要求立即在朝鲜停战，反对美国政府破坏停战谈判的阴谋。福斯特在纽约“工人日报”首页刊载的专论中写道：“停战的基础早已在板门店谈判中树立了，无论如何不能让黩武分子与帝国主义者利用战俘问题上的僵局作为继续与扩大战争的藉口。”
    福斯特说：“继续战争的责任，毫无疑问，应该由躲在联合国这块虚伪招牌后面的华盛顿政治与军事领袖们担负。他们从开头就计划在进行停战谈判的同时进行战争。经常发动连续的地面战争、海面轰击、特别是大规模猛烈的空袭的，也就是他们这些人。”
    福斯特指出：美国军事领袖和杜鲁门政府采取这个极端挑拨性的、继续战争的政策，原因是他们根本不想停止战争，他们知道朝鲜问题的和平解决将沉重地打击他们制造战争歇斯底里的谎言，并将缓和紧张的世界政治局势，这些都是华尔街的唯利是图的战争贩子们所最不愿做的事。
    福斯特说：广大的美国人民憎恨朝鲜战争，热诚希望朝鲜的和平与世界的安宁。这一点反映在最近的民意测验结果中，民意测验显出绝大多数美国人民认为朝鲜战争是“完全无用”的。尽管军人们诡称美国处于“全国紧急状态”下，但工人们决心罢工，人民反对高税额与高物价。在这方面，我党和反对在朝鲜进行帝国主义战争的美国其他进步分子，代表了美国人民的真正精神和利益。
    福斯特最后写道：“美国领袖们企图用一再延长谈判会议的休会的时间这种办法来使整个谈判破裂。这是绝对不能容许的。”
