    Literary and Art Movement in the People's Liberation Army

    (I)
    The literary and artistic work of the People's Liberation Army is a part of our army's political work, and a powerful weapon for accomplishing every political task. Since the Red Army era, Chairman Mao has called on all officers and soldiers to pay attention to propaganda work, and literary and artistic work is one of the important ways of propaganda. From that time on, literary and artistic propaganda activities in companies gradually developed, such as singing, dancing, acting, publishing wall newspapers and pictorials, and masquerade propaganda, etc., and company clubs and professional propaganda teams at all levels were established; they adopted various forms to carry out mobilization work during the troops' marching, fighting, and training, carried out propaganda and mobilization work among the people, and disintegrated the enemy by means of front-line appeals, leaflets, cartoons, etc. The characteristics of combat effectiveness and mass character of literary and artistic work in the Red Army era are the excellent traditions inherited and carried forward by the literary and artistic work of our army in its subsequent development stages.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and thereafter, with the development and growth of our army, the literary and artistic work of the troops also developed vigorously. "Soldiers acting as soldiers", "soldiers writing about soldiers" and other diverse literary and artistic activities appeared in the companies. After the national victory, company literary and artistic activities had more convenient conditions. Many troops' companies and platoons had their own singing teams, bands, and dance teams; a large number of kuaiban (clapper talk) poets, painters, singers, and musical instrument experts continued to emerge, and the hero Gao Yubao was the most typical example of a novelist produced by our army from the ranks of soldiers. With the growth of our army, the literary and art troupes, propaganda teams and other professional writers and artists at all levels of our army have also been greatly enriched and developed. Since the War of Resistance, a large number of literary and art cadres have been trained in Yan'an and other anti-Japanese base areas to enrich the troops. After the victory of the People's Liberation War, the number of literary and artistic workers in the troops increased greatly. They followed the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, faced the companies, and served the soldiers. Literary and art troupes and teams are the backbone of our army's literary and artistic work. By going deep into the companies, they not only helped and promoted the literary and artistic activities of the companies, but also continuously improved their own creation and performance. The number of literary and artistic books and periodicals in the troops has also increased greatly since the War of Resistance Against Japan, especially after the People's Liberation War, and it has become an indispensable spiritual food for the vast number of soldiers and cadres.
    (II)
    One of the greatest characteristics of literary and artistic work in the People's Liberation Army is that it serves the current political struggle with all its strength and plays its combat role in coordinating the completion of every central task. The song "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" produced in the Red Army era is still a motto for every officer and soldier of our army to consciously abide by the discipline of the troops. The script "Broken Straw Sandals" created during the Long March played a huge role in encouraging the fighting will of the troops and strengthening the confidence in victory at that time. "The Bandit Chief," "Awe-inspiring Mountains and Rivers," and "The People's Soldiers and the Common People" all generated infinite power in arousing hatred for Japanese imperialism and mobilizing the people to fight against the enemy. In the Great Production Movement carried out in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other anti-Japanese base areas to overcome difficulties and persist in the struggle, literary and artistic workers used various forms to praise labor heroes and encourage production enthusiasm. In the War of Liberation, the heroic figures described in scripts such as "Hero Liu Sihu," "Steel Bones and Iron Tendons," "Dong Cunrui," and novels such as "Invincible Three Heroes" and "Storm on the Sea" became models for officers and soldiers to learn from. The performances of "Wang Keqin Squad" and "Two Kinds of Work Style" played a good role in establishing a correct leadership style and strengthening unity, mutual assistance and brotherly love in the troops. The drama "How Shells Are Made" played a great role in calling on and inspiring our army cadres to be good at accepting new things and working hard to learn. And the combat newsletter "Who Are the Most Lovable People" is well known for its huge promotion of the anti-US and aid-Korea movement among the people of the whole country. As for the movie script "South and North War", the dance "Soldier's Game Dance", especially the full-length novel "Gao Yubao" written entirely by soldier writers, it is a great harvest of the literary and artistic work of our army.
    These excellent creations and performances not only have correct political content, but also have considerable artistic skills; they use the language of the masses and the national style to accurately and vividly reflect the actual life of the troops, create typical heroic images and very moving plots, and therefore have won the love and warm welcome of the vast number of cadres and soldiers.
    The literary and art troupes, propaganda teams and other literary and artistic workers in the troops were active on the front lines and in field hospitals during the war, and were active on the playground or in the classroom during the period of peaceful army building. Sometimes they are also combatants, stretcher bearers, nurses or general political workers. During the Red Army's arduous Long March, the propaganda team's mobilization booth is still unforgettable for many veterans. In the Huaihai Campaign in the War of Liberation, all the members of the literary and art troupes and teams went to the front line to carry out literary and artistic work. They were divided into many groups, took simple musical instruments and went deep into the squads and platoons to perform on various positions. They participated in front-line celebrations, meritorious services, or front-line grievance meetings, and compiled the deeds of the soldiers into short programs at any time to mobilize everyone. Not only that, they also used loudspeakers to carry out propaganda and appeals to the enemy, tell kuaiban, and sing songs to disintegrate the enemy soldiers. With the assistance of literary and artistic workers, mass literary and artistic activities on the front line have also been widely developed. The trenches and bunkers are filled with trench poems, wall newspapers, etc. written by the soldiers themselves. When chasing the enemy, wherever the troops chased, as long as they rested, they immediately carried out various recreational activities. All these activities achieved the purpose of timely encouraging combat morale, enlivening soldiers' lives, and improving soldiers' political awareness and confidence in victory, and played a certain role in defeating the enemy.
    Another characteristic of our army's literary and artistic work is its broad mass character. That is to say, not only professional literary and art troupes and teams or other writers and artists are creating and performing, but also the vast number of officers and soldiers of the whole army are participating in these activities. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of works created by officers and soldiers of the troops themselves, such as kuaiban, gun poems, drum lyrics, songs, dances, novels, comic strips, cartoons, and scripts written and performed by themselves, have been produced every year, many of which are frequently published or compiled and published in various army newspapers and periodicals. These things vividly express their lives and thoughts, and express their great and sublime emotions of hating the enemy and loving the people.
    The leaders at all levels of the troops have always attached importance to and planned to lead the development of literary and artistic work in our army. On the one hand, they pay attention to training various literary and artistic cadres and literary and artistic backbones in the company, and give full guarantees to the troops' literary and artistic activities in terms of material (such as necessary funds and equipment) and other aspects; on the other hand, they pay more attention to vigorously advocating and promoting the mass literary and artistic activities of various troops. Many battalion and regimental cadres even personally take the lead in participating in acting, dancing, singing, playing musical instruments, or guiding playwriting, directing and writing among the soldiers. Many senior commanders have written novels of more than 100,000 words or novellas, and written many poems based on their rich war life experience. Due to the enthusiastic love and active participation of the vast number of officers and soldiers, not only has the literary and artistic work of the troops been vigorously developed, but also our army has quickly become a unit with a high degree of cultural cultivation.
    (III)
    In the development process of literary and artistic work in our army, in order to adhere to the direction of literature and art indicated by Chairman Mao, sharp struggles against various erroneous tendencies have been systematically carried out in various periods, and effectively overcome. With the development of the people's war and the development of the domestic political situation, a large number of literary and artistic workers and young intellectuals have continuously joined the People's Liberation Army, adding new strength to the literary and artistic work of our army. However, on the other hand, because most of them were from petty bourgeois backgrounds, they also brought many adverse effects to our literary and artistic work, mainly manifested as: literature and art being divorced from politics, divorced from the masses, one-sided pursuit of form, "art for art's sake", and replacing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought with bourgeois literary and artistic views; in practical actions, they are manifested as: a willingness to engage in "big works," performing big plays, performing foreign plays, unwillingness to cooperate with the current tasks of the troops, unwillingness to go deep into the company, deep into the life of the soldiers, they look down on the more simple creations from the masses in the troops, and one-sidedly emphasize "improvement." These erroneous ideas and erroneous tendencies once caused confusion and stagnation in our literary and artistic work. In 1942, after the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the leaders of the troops seriously organized all the literary and art troupes, teams and other literary and artistic workers to study Chairman Mao's speech, launched a resolute struggle against various erroneous thoughts and styles, clarified the chaotic phenomenon in literary and artistic work, and specifically proposed the slogan of action of "facing the company and serving the soldiers." In this way, the literary and artistic work of the troops has been newly developed, and literary and artistic workers have gone deep into the company, to the battle, and to various positions in large numbers, and have integrated with cadres and soldiers, so that their original petty bourgeois thoughts and feelings have been greatly transformed, and they have gradually become consistent with the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants and soldiers. Because they understood the needs of the masses and had sources of creation, they produced a large number of good works loved by soldiers and cadres, which played a good role in promoting the troops to complete the tasks of struggle in various periods.
    However, in the past two or three years, due to the insufficient study of Marxism-Leninism by some literary and artistic workers, their ideological level is not high, and the ideological views of the petty bourgeoisie have not been completely transformed. Therefore, they have a one-sided understanding and emphasis on some life phenomena and certain backward facts. They do not seriously study and comprehend the essence of troop life, and thus the tendency of formalism of the so-called "backward to transformation" has emerged. The image of great heroic figures that we should create and praise, this practice seriously distorted the reality of our troops and made creation fall into poverty. At the First All-Army Propaganda, Education and Culture Work Conference in 1950, we criticized this tendency and proposed creating revolutionary hero images of the People's Liberation Army as the main task of literary and artistic work in the troops. Since then, at the Second All-Army Propaganda, Education and Culture Work Conference in 1951 and the All-Army Cultural Minister Symposium in 1952, new deviations arising in the description of heroic figures in conceptualization and formalization were also corrected according to specific circumstances.
    The struggles against erroneous tendencies and frequent literary and artistic criticisms in various periods in the development process of the People's Liberation Army's literary and artistic work were all carried out under the strong leadership of the Party in the troops; therefore, it was guaranteed that it would not be divorced from politics, from the masses, and from the actual situation of the troops; it would serve politics with all its strength, serve the current struggle, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers; therefore, it could always follow the correct line and direction indicated by Chairman Mao and develop forward.
    (IV)
    At present, our army is in a period of building a strong and modern national defense army to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and defend the motherland. The literary and artistic work of our army, like other departments, bears a greater and glorious task. We must continue to inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of literary and artistic work in our army since the Red Army era, continue to implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy, and comprehensively develop literature and art that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to cooperate with the great task of our national defense army construction and the large-scale economic construction of the country. In the future, on the basis of the rapid elimination of illiteracy among the troops and the rapid improvement of the cultural level of cadres and soldiers, the literary and artistic work of our army will have a broader prospect of development, and the content of literary and artistic activities will be more abundant and diverse. The typical example of the cultural, recreational and sports activities of a certain regiment of the South China Military Region recently shows the situation of literary and artistic work that is emerging in our army. Now the literary and art troupes and teams of the whole army have been reorganized, and the organization is more streamlined. The combination of professional literary and artistic workers and mass literary and artistic activities will not only make literature and art deeply popular, but also will inevitably be continuously improved on the basis of popularization. We can foresee that in the near future, the literary and artistic work of the troops will "let a hundred flowers bloom".

    人民解放军中的文艺运动
    李伟  鲁勒
    （一）
    人民解放军中的文艺工作，是我军政治工作的一部分，是完成每一政治任务的有力武器之一。从红军时代起，毛主席就号召全军指战员重视宣传工作，而文艺工作，则是宣传工作的重要方式之一。从那时起，就逐渐发展了连队的文艺宣传活动，如唱歌、舞蹈、演戏、出壁报画报、化装宣传等，并建立了连队俱乐部和各级专职的宣传队；他们在部队行军、打仗、整训中采取各种形式进行鼓动工作，在人民群众中进行宣传动员工作，并用火线喊话、传单、漫画等方式瓦解敌人。而红军时代文艺工作的战斗性和群众性的特色，则是我军以后各个发展时期文艺工作所继承和发扬的优良传统。
    在抗日战争中，解放战争中及其后，随着我军的发展壮大，部队文艺工作也得到了蓬勃的发展，在连队中出现了“兵演兵”“兵写兵”及其他多种多样的文艺活动。在全国胜利之后，连队文艺活动有了更便利的条件，好些部队的营连有了自己的歌咏队、乐队、舞蹈队；大批的快板诗作家、画家、歌手和乐器能手不断涌现，而英雄高玉宝则是我军从战士中产生的小说作家最典型的范例。随着我军的壮大，我军各级文工团、宣传队和其他专业作家、艺术家，也得到了很大的充实和发展，从抗战时期起在延安和其他各抗日根据地培养了大批的文艺干部充实到部队去，人民解放战争胜利之后，部队文艺工作者又大量增加，他们遵循着毛主席指示的方向，面向连队，为兵服务。文工团、队是我军文艺工作的基干部队，他们在深入连队中既帮助和推动了连队文艺活动，又使自己的创作和演出不断得到提高。部队文艺书籍和刊物的数量从抗战时期，特别是人民解放战争以后也大量增长了，它已成为广大战士干部不可缺少的精神食粮。
    （二）
    人民解放军中的文艺工作的最大特点之一，是它全力地为当前政治斗争服务，在配合完成每一中心任务中发挥它的战斗作用。红军时代所产生的“三大纪律八项注意”的歌子，至今仍为我军每一指战员自觉遵守部队纪律的格言。长征中所创作的剧本“破草鞋”，在当时鼓舞部队的战斗意志，加强胜利信心方面起了巨大的作用。“流寇队长”、“气壮山河”、“子弟兵和老百姓”，在激发对日本帝国主义仇恨，动员人民对敌斗争都产生了无穷的力量。在陕甘宁边区及其他各个抗日根据地中为着度过困难、坚持斗争所进行的大生产运动，文艺工作者以各种形式歌颂劳动英雄，鼓舞生产情绪。在解放战争中，剧本如“英雄刘四虎”、“钢骨铁筋”、“董存瑞”、小说“无敌三勇士”、“海上风暴”中所描述的英雄人物在指战员中成为学习的榜样；“王克勤班”、“两种作风”的演出在树立正确的领导作风，加强部队团结和互助友爱方面都起了良好的影响。话剧“炮弹是怎样造成的”对号召和启发我军干部如何善于接受新鲜事物、努力学习起着很大作用。而战斗通讯“谁是最可爱的人”对于我全国军民在抗美援朝运动中的巨大推动作用则是人所共知的。至于电影剧本“南征北战”，舞蹈“战士游戏舞”，特别是完全从战士作家手中写成的长篇小说“高玉宝”，乃是我军文艺工作的很大收获。
    这些优秀的创作和演出，不仅有正确的政治内容，而且已具有相当高的艺术技巧；它们用群众的语言和民族的风格，正确地、生动地反映了部队的生活实际，创造了典型的英雄形象和很动人的情节，因而获得了广大干部战士的喜爱和热烈欢迎。
    部队的文工团、宣传队及其它岗位上的文艺工作者，在战争时期活跃在火线上、野战医院里，在和平建军时期则活跃在操场上或课堂里。有时他们自己也是战斗员、担架员、护士或是一般的政治工作人员。在红军艰苦的长征途中，宣传队的鼓动棚至今仍是很多老同志念念不忘的。在解放战争中的淮海战役，所有的文工团、队人员都到火线去开展文艺工作，他们分成许多小组，带上简单的乐器深入班排，到各个阵地上进行演唱，他们参加火线祝捷、庆功、或火线诉苦会，将战士中的事迹随时编成短小的节目向大家作鼓动。不但如此，他们还通过扩音器进行对敌宣传、喊话、说快板、唱歌以瓦解敌方士兵。在文艺工作者的协助下，火线上群众性的文艺活动也得到了广泛发展，在战壕里和地堡里，贴满了战士们自己写的战壕诗、墙报等；在追击敌人时，部队无论追到那里，只要一休息下来，马上就进行各种文娱活动，这一切活动都达到了及时鼓舞战斗情绪、活跃战士生活、提高战士政治觉悟和胜利信心的目的，对战胜敌人起了一定的作用。
    我军文艺工作的另一特点，是它的广泛群众性。这就是说不只有专业的文工团、队或其它的作家、艺术家在创作和演出，而且有全军广大指战员都来参加这些活动。近几年来，部队指战员中自己创作的快板、枪杆诗、大鼓词、歌曲、舞蹈、小说、连环画、漫画和自编自演的剧本等作品，每年都有数十万件产生，其中有许多优秀的作品经常为各部队报纸刊物所发表或汇集出版，这些东西生动活泼地表现了他们的生活和思想，表现了他们憎恨敌人，热爱人民的伟大崇高的情感。
    部队各级领导上都经常重视和有计划地领导开展我军文艺工作，他们一面注意培养训练各种文艺干部和连队文艺骨干，给予部队文艺活动以物质上的（如必要的经费、器材）及其它各方面的充分保证；另一方面更注意大力提倡和推动各部队群众性的文艺活动；很多的营、团干部甚至亲自带头参加到战士中去演戏、舞蹈、唱歌、弄乐器，或指导编剧、排戏和写作，不少的高级指挥员曾以自己丰富的战争生活经历为题材，写过十万字以上的长篇或中篇小说，写过很多的诗歌，由于广大指战员热烈爱好和积极参加，不但使部队文艺工作得到蓬勃的开展，而且也很快使我军成为一支具有高度文化教养的部队。
    （三）
    在我军文艺工作的发展过程中，为着坚持毛主席所指示的文艺方向，曾在各个时期有系统地进行了反对各种错误倾向的尖锐斗争，并有效地克服了它。随着人民战争的发展，和国内政治形势的发展，大批的文艺工作者和青年知识分子曾不断参加到人民解放军中来，使我军文艺工作增加了新的力量，但另一方面由于他们大多是小资产阶级出身，因而也给我们的文艺工作带来了许多不良的影响，主要表现为：文艺脱离政治、脱离群众、片面追求形式、“艺术至上”，以资产阶级的文艺观点来代替马克思列宁主义、毛泽东的文艺思想；在实际行动上则表现为：愿搞“大作品”，演大戏、演外国戏，不愿配合部队当前的任务的风气，不愿深入连队、深入战士生活，他们看不起部队中较为朴素的、来自广大群众的创作，片面地强调“提高”。这些错误思想和错误倾向，曾使我们的文艺工作一时造成混乱和停滞状态。一九四二年，毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表之后，部队领导上认真地组织了所有的文工团、队及其他文艺工作者学习了毛主席这一讲话，对各种错误思想作风展开了坚决的斗争，澄清了文艺工作上的混乱现象，并具体地提出了“面向连队、为兵服务”的行动口号，这样，就使部队文艺工作有了新的发展，文艺工作者大量地深入到连队中去，到战斗中去、到各种岗位中去，和干部、战士打成一片，使他们原来的小资产阶级的思想情感得到了很大改造，而与工农兵的思想情感逐渐一致起来。由于了解了群众的需要、又有了创作的来源，他们就产生出大量的为战士干部所喜爱的好作品，对部队完成各个时期的斗争任务起了良好的推动作用。
    但是，近两三年来，由于一些文艺工作者对马克思列宁主义学习不够，思想水平不高，对小资产阶级的思想观点改造得还不彻底，因而对一些生活现象和某些落后事实作片面的认识和强调，不去认真研究和领会部队生活实质，于是产生了所谓“落后到转变”的公式主义的倾向，以描写落后人物的转变来代替我们应当正面创造和歌颂的伟大英雄人物的形象，这种作法，严重地歪曲了我们部队的现实，并使创作陷于贫乏的境地。在一九五○年全军第一届宣教文化工作会议上，我们批判了这一倾向，提出创造人民解放军的革命英雄形象作为部队文艺工作的主要任务。此后，在一九五一年全军第二届宣教文化工作会议上及一九五二年全军文化部长座谈会上，又根据具体情况提出了纠正在描写英雄人物时所产生的概念化、公式化的新的偏向。
    人民解放军文艺工作的发展过程中各个时期对错误倾向所展开的斗争和经常的文艺批评，都是在部队党的坚强领导下进行的；因而保证了使其不致脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离部队实际；使它全力地为政治服务、为当前的斗争服务、为工农兵服务；因而能始终遵循着毛主席所指示的正确方针与方向向前发展。
    （四）
    目前，我军正处在建设强大的现代化国防军，以巩固人民民主专政、保卫祖国的时期，我军的文艺工作也正如其它部门工作一样负有更重大的光荣的任务，我们必须继续继承和发扬我军从红军时代以来文艺工作的优良传统，继续贯彻毛主席的文艺方针，全面地发展为工农兵服务的文艺，以配合我国防军建设和全国大规模经济建设的伟大任务。今后我军在全军迅速消除了文盲，干部战士的文化水平很快地提高的基础之上，文艺工作将得到更加广泛发展的前途，文艺活动的内容将更为丰富，多种多样，最近华南军区某团的文娱体育活动的典型例子就说明了我军正在出现的文艺工作情况。现在全军的文工团、队都已经过整编，组织上更加精干，专业的文艺工作者与广大的群众性的文艺活动相结合，不但将使文艺深入普及，而且必然要在普及的基础上不断得到提高，我们可以预见到不久的将来部队文艺将要“百花齐放”。
