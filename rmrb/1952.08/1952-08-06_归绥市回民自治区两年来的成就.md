On December 28, 1950, the Suiyuan Provincial Military and Political Committee, based on the provisions of the Common Program and the demands of the Hui people in Guisui City, established the Hui Autonomous Region in the Hui-populated area of Guisui City to implement ethnic regional autonomy. The Hui people felt infinite excitement and joy for this measure. On that day, the Hui people of Guisui all dressed in festive costumes, and the Hui people from cities, counties, and banners in eastern and western Guisui also sent representatives to congratulate them. They said, "Chairman Mao loves us and allows us to establish our own government; we also love Chairman Mao, and we will repay Chairman Mao's care with practical actions in running the autonomous region well."

In the past two years, under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the provincial and municipal people's governments, the Autonomous Region People's Government has made many important achievements in various tasks.

There are more than 8,600 Hui people, more than 3,800 Han people, and a small number of Mongolian, Korean, and Uyghur people in the Guisui Hui Autonomous Region. In the past, due to the malicious instigation of the reactionary ruling classes of all dynasties, mutual hatred and discrimination between the Hui-Han and Hui-Mongolian ethnic groups were created. Therefore, after the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government, it first paid attention to ethnic unity work. During the first Spring Festival after the establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region, the Hui people voluntarily formed "New Year's visit groups" to wish the Han people in the Autonomous Region a happy New Year from door to door. The Han people also respected the customs and habits of the Hui people everywhere, agreeing not to raise livestock in the same courtyard with the Hui people to avoid uncleanliness. When gathering with the Hui people, they did not smoke or drink alcohol. During the Eid al-Fitr last year, the Hui people donated a total of 4.5 million yuan according to the provisions of the Quran and according to their personal economic conditions to help the poor people of all ethnic groups. When Li Delu, a Han Chinese, had a child, his family was experiencing financial difficulties, and the nearby Hui people automatically provided relief. Wang Fulu, a Han Chinese, also enthusiastically helped the Hui-Mongolian people improve agricultural cultivation. Ha Shufang and Guo Jimin, Hui and Han women who had not spoken to each other for six years, are now reconciled. The children of the Hui and Han ethnic groups no longer provoked and cursed each other as they did in the past. Especially after various vigorous mass movements, the Hui and Han people have become more closely united. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the Hui and Han people jointly accused the Hui scum Ai Futang and others of counter-revolutionary crimes. In the land reform movement, the Hui and Han people fought against the landlords together, divided the land, and then helped each other in production. During the "Five-Anti" movement, people of all ethnic groups assisted the government in investigating the crimes of unscrupulous merchants. While eliminating ethnic estrangement, the Hui people have also become more united internally. In the past, the ruling class used different regions, interpretations of doctrines, and original religious rituals to create disputes and divisions within the Hui people, dividing the Hui people into two original religious groups, "New Sect" and "Old Sect," who did not intermarry and even provoked fights. Now, the general Hui people have eliminated their prejudices, and the imams of the two factions often gather together to discuss internal religious issues. During the Eid al-Adha in 1951, the imams and hailis of the city's eight mosques and the Hui people of the city gathered together, which moved many elderly Hui people very much, because this had not happened for many years.

The Autonomous Region People's Government correctly led the production undertakings of the people in the Autonomous Region and improved the people's lives. In the past, the vast majority of the Hui people in Guisui City were engaged in small-scale businesses with no fixed locations, their economic base was weak, and their lives were very poor. In the past two years, this situation has been fundamentally changed as a result of the Autonomous Region People's Government's step-by-step and planned development of production. The People's Government has established Hui supply and marketing cooperatives, oil presses, slaughterhouses, etc. in the Autonomous Region. The establishment of a wool spinning and weaving factory has solved the livelihood problems of the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and most of the poor Hui people in the whole region. The Autonomous Region People's Government has especially carried out the work of "organizing" in several industries with the largest number of employees. Among them, the camel transportation freight yard is a large-scale joint organization. The camel transportation industry originally had 210 camel households and 1,000 camels, and now it has developed to 450 households (of which Hui households account for more than 80%) and nearly 3,000 camels. Last year, with the introduction of the Suiyuan Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission and the Autonomous Region People's Government, the camel transportation freight yard transported natural alkali for the Baotou Ximeng Trading Company and earned 3 billion yuan in freight. The Autonomous Region People's Government also led 197 small vendors to form joint operation teams. These teams have all received loans from banks. They operate collectively and go to the countryside in batches, developing production and promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

Helping some declining industries to change careers is another achievement in the economic work of the Autonomous Region. For example, 106 of the original 170 "tooth brokers" have changed careers. Many unemployed people have also found jobs after education and transformation, and 700 people have been introduced to production by the Autonomous Region People's Government. With the improvement of the economic situation in the Autonomous Region and the improvement of people's living standards, the consumer cooperatives in the Autonomous Region have also gradually developed. There are now 3,700 members. It can sell more than 10 million yuan of goods every day, which basically solves the problem of supplying consumer goods to the people in the Autonomous Region.

The Autonomous Region People's Government has developed cultural and educational undertakings in the Autonomous Region. The long-term economic poverty has caused the backwardness of the Hui people's culture and education. In the past, the illiteracy rate among the Hui people in the Autonomous Region was more than 90%. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the only Hui primary school in Guisui City was also cancelled. After liberation, the People's Government restored this primary school and added another primary school. At present, the number of Hui children enrolled in school has reached more than 80% of the school-age children, totaling more than 700 people, which is twice as many as before liberation. Adults also have the opportunity to study. In 1950, the Autonomous Region opened the first amateur people's school, which had only 27 students at that time. This year, a total of 706 people participated in the people's school, of which more than 600 were Hui people. There are 70 reading groups in the whole region, and more than 1,000 people regularly participate in reading newspapers. The propaganda network has been widely established, and 61 propagandists regularly conduct propaganda in combination with mass learning. Under the teachings of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Hui people have improved their political consciousness and love their motherland. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, more than 70% of the households in the entire Autonomous Region have signed patriotic covenants and established a regular inspection system. The people of the Autonomous Region regularly send a large number of condolence money and letters to the front. More than 65% of the people signed the declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace covenant, and at the same time held a vote on the Japanese issue. More than a quarter of the Hui people participated in the demonstration against the United States rearming Japan in the wind and snow. In the movement to donate weapons, the people of the entire Autonomous Region donated 450 million yuan. Nine outstanding Hui youths have participated in military cadre schools and anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea nursing work. Recently, in order to oppose the bacteriological warfare waged by the U.S. aggressors, the people of the Autonomous Region have launched a large-scale patriotic health movement in the whole region.

    归绥市回民自治区两年来的成就
    郭谦  李宗海
    一九五○年十二月二十八日，绥远省军政委员会根据共同纲领的规定和归绥市回族人民的要求，在归绥市回民聚居区成立了回民自治区，实行民族区域自治。对于这一措施，回族人民感到无限的兴奋和欢欣。那天，归绥全市的回民都穿上节日的盛装，绥东、绥西各市、县、旗的回民也选派了代表，前来祝贺。他们说：“毛主席爱我们，让我们成立了自己的政府；我们也爱毛主席，我们要用办好自治区的实际行动来报答毛主席的关怀。”
    近两年来，自治区人民政府在共产党和省市人民政府的领导帮助之下，在各种工作中，做出许多重要的成绩。
    归绥市回民自治区内有回民八千六百多名，汉民三千八百多名，还有少数的蒙族、朝鲜族和维吾尔族人民。过去，由于历代反动统治阶级的恶意挑拨，造成了回汉、回蒙民族之间的相互仇恨和歧视。因此，自治区人民政府成立之后，首先注意了民族团结工作。回民自治区成立后的第一个春节，回民就自动组成“拜年团”，挨门逐户地向自治区内的汉族人民祝贺年节。汉族人民也处处尊重回族人民的风俗习惯，相约和回民同住一院的不养牲畜，以免使环境不清洁。和回民聚会时不吸烟、不喝酒。去年开斋节时，回民依据古兰经的规定，按照个人的经济状况，共捐出四百五十万元，帮助各族的贫苦人民。汉民李德禄家生小孩时，正值家庭生活困难，附近回民便自动予以救济。汉民王福禄也热心地帮助回蒙人民改进农业耕作。六年来彼此不说话的回、汉妇女哈淑芳和郭济民，现在和好了。回汉两族的孩子，也不像过去那样时常寻衅谩骂了。特别是经过各种轰轰烈烈的群众运动，回汉人民更加紧密地团结起来了。在镇压反革命运动中，回汉人民共同控诉了回族败类艾福堂等的反革命罪行。土地改革运动中，回汉人民在一起斗倒了地主，分得了土地，以后又在一起互助生产。“五反”运动中，各族人民协助政府调查了奸商的罪行。在消除民族隔阂的同时，回族人民内部也更加团结了。过去，统治阶级曾假借地域不同、教义讲解和原教仪式的不同，制造回民内部的纠纷和分裂，使得回民分为“新行”、“古行”两个原教集团，互不通婚，甚至寻衅械斗。现在，一般回民之间已经化除成见，两派的阿訇也都常常聚在一起，商讨宗教内部问题。一九五一年大尔代节时，全市八个清真寺的阿訇、海力凡和全市回民一齐聚会，使许多年老的回民十分感动。因为这是多年未曾有过的事情。
    自治区人民政府正确地领导了自治区人民的生产事业，改善了人民的生活。过去，归绥市绝大部分回民都是从事不固定的小本经营，经济基础薄弱，生活十分贫困。近两年来，自治区人民政府有步骤有计划地发展生产的结果，这种情况已基本改变。人民政府在自治区内成立了回民供应社、榨油厂、屠宰场等。弹毛纺织厂的成立，解决了全区烈属、军属和大部分贫苦回民的生活问题。自治区人民政府特别在几个从业人数最多的行业里进行了“组织起来”的工作。其中骆驼运输货栈就是大型的联营组织。骆驼运输业原有骆驼户二百一十户、骆驼一千匹，现已发展到四百五十户（其中回民户占百分之八十以上）、骆驼近三千匹。去年经绥远省民族事务委员会和自治区人民政府的介绍，骆驼运输货栈承运了包头西蒙贸易公司的天然碱，获得运费三十亿元。自治区人民政府还领导一百九十七户小商贩组成联营小组。这些小组都得到了银行的贷款。他们集体经营，分批下乡，一方面发展了生产，同时又促进了城乡物资交流。
    帮助某些没落的行业转业，是自治区经济工作中的另一成就。如原来的一百七十个“牙纪”，已有一百零六人转业。许多无业游民经过教育改造，也已找到职业，并有七百人经自治区人民政府介绍参加了生产。随着自治区经济情况的改善，人民生活水平的提高，自治区消费合作社也日渐发展。现有社员三千七百人。每日可出售一千多万元的货品，基本上解决了自治区人民消费品的供应问题。
    自治区人民政府发展了自治区内的文化教育事业。经济的长期贫困，曾造成回民文化教育的落后。过去，自治区回民中文盲占百分之九十以上。国民党反动派统治时期，归绥市一所仅有的回民完全小学也被取消。解放以后，人民政府恢复了这所小学，并增设了一所完全小学。目前，回民入学儿童已达学龄儿童的百分之八十以上，计七百余人，比解放以前增加了两倍。成年人也有了学习的机会。一九五○年，自治区开办了第一所业余民校，当时只有二十七名学员。今年参加民校学习的共七百零六人，其中回民有六百多人。全区共有七十个读报组，经常参加读报的有一千多人。宣传网已普遍建立起来，六十一名宣传员经常结合群众性的学习进行宣传。回族人民在毛主席、共产党的教导下，政治觉悟提高了，他们热爱自己的祖国。在抗美援朝运动中，全自治区百分之七十以上的住户订立了爱国公约，并建立起经常的检查制度。自治区人民经常把大批的慰问金、慰问信寄向前方。百分之六十五以上的人民在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签了名，同时举行了对日本问题的投票。四分之一以上的回民，冒着风雪参加了反对美国重新武装日本的示威游行。在捐献武器运动中，全自治区人民捐献了四亿五千万元。并有九名优秀的回民子弟参加了军事干部学校和抗美援朝的护理工作。最近自治区人民为了反对美国侵略者进行的细菌战，已在全区展开了规模巨大的爱国卫生运动。
