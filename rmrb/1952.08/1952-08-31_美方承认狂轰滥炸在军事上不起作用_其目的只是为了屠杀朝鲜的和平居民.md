Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 30th. The purpose of the U.S. Air Force's indiscriminate bombing of northern Korea is solely to destroy peaceful towns and massacre peaceful residents. This sinister objective is being increasingly confirmed by the recent statements of American generals and American newspapers.

　　The U.S. Air Force's indiscriminate bombing is militarily ineffective; American generals and newspapers alike are compelled to acknowledge this fact. According to the Associated Press, the commander of the U.S. Fifth Air Force, General Barcus, admitted in a statement on the 24th that it is "difficult" to defeat the Communist forces with air power. He conceded that despite the U.S. Air Force's indiscriminate bombing, "the enemy can still transport supplies from all over North Korea to the front." Simultaneously, Wall Street's mouthpiece, "The New York Times," also acknowledged in a Tokyo dispatch on the 17th that "no one knows how much effect this new tactic (referring to the U.S. Air Force's indiscriminate bombing) will have, and even the most optimistic人士 cannot predict that it will have a decisive impact on the Korean War." The paper admitted that it is "impossible to completely isolate the front and rear" by relying on indiscriminate bombing, and that "the enemy forces on the front lines obviously still have the military supplies to fight—in recent local battles, they have fought fiercely and used a large amount of artillery and mortar shells."

　　In fact, our military targets are either not establishing strong armed defenses, or are well hidden and protected, and the U.S. Air Force simply dares not or cannot destroy them. The New York Times admitted as early as August 3rd:
　　"There are few good military targets left in North Korea." Because, as Reuters admitted in a dispatch on July 22nd: "The Communists' important supplies are all hidden deep underground, protected by towering mountains," and "the Communists and their supply convoys are almost invisible even in clear weather."

　　Since the U.S. Air Force's indiscriminate bombing is militarily ineffective and cannot hit military targets, its sole target is of course the old, weak, women, and children of Korea. "The New York Times" cannot hide this fact either. The paper shamelessly admitted on the 26th that the purpose of the U.S. aircraft's "intensified air strikes" is to "massacre" "innocent people." The paper also tried its best to portray this inhumane "massacre" as justified. The paper said: "We believe that North Korea's protest against the intensified air strikes by the United Nations cannot be accepted on the surface." Its so-called reason is: "Due to the changing nature of the war, ... the war is no longer fought by a small group of professional soldiers, but by the entire people." Therefore, "innocent people are destined to suffer." The paper said that in order to achieve its goals, the American aggressors "have to take their (referring to the Korean people) lives." The paper also revealed its hideous features and blatantly declared: The American aggressors are determined to continue this "massacre." The New York Times here nakedly confessed the sinister plot of the American aggressors, that is: in view of the Korean people's unanimous resistance to American aggression, and their solemn rejection of the U.S. attempt to unreasonably detain our prisoners of war, the American aggressors are determined to achieve the goal of sabotaging negotiations and expanding the war by carrying out bloody crimes of frantically massacring the entire Korean people.

　　When the commander of the U.S. Fifth Air Force, General Barcus, spoke on the 24th about the bloody plan to bomb seventy-eight cities, he also declared: "Perhaps other places will be added to this list." This exposes the fact that the American robbers are also plotting to further expand the scope of their massacre of peaceful residents. The facts show that the U.S. Air Force is stepping up the bombing of peaceful towns and women, children, and the elderly in Korea. For example, in the bombing on the morning of the 27th, U.S. aircraft dropped more than 380 bombs on the western district of Pyongyang, where residents were concentrated. Many elderly, weak, women, and children were caught off guard in their sleep and were brutally murdered.

　　The U.S. side's lie of calling peaceful Korean towns "military targets" has been completely bankrupt, and they themselves have begun to openly admit that their purpose is to massacre peaceful residents. In this way, the American butchers have used their own hands to take off the mask of "humanity," and they will be even more unable to escape the just sanctions of the people of the world.

### 美方承认狂轰滥炸在军事上不起作用　其目的只是为了屠杀朝鲜的和平居民

    美方承认狂轰滥炸在军事上不起作用
  　其目的只是为了屠杀朝鲜的和平居民
    【新华社开城三十日电】美国空军对朝鲜北部地区的狂轰滥炸，目的只是为了破坏和平城镇，屠杀和平居民。这一罪恶目的，从最近美国将军们和美国报纸的言论中，正不断得到证明。
    美国空军的狂轰滥炸在军事上是不起作用的，美国的将军和美国报纸都不得不承认这个事实。据美联社透露：美国第五航空队司令巴喀斯在二十四日发表的谈话中承认：用空军力量打垮共军“是很难的事”。他承认，尽管美国空军狂轰滥炸，“敌人现在仍然可以从北朝鲜各地运输供应品到前线”。同时，华尔街的喉舌“纽约时报”在十七日该报东京电讯中也承认：“任何人都不知道这种新战术（指美空军的狂轰滥炸）会有多少效果，就是最乐观的人士也不能预言它会对朝鲜战争起决定性的影响”。该报承认：要依靠狂轰滥炸来“完全隔绝前后方是不可能的”，“战线上的敌军显然仍拥有用以作战的军需品供应——在近来的局部战役中，他们进行了很猛烈的战斗，并用了大量的大炮和迫击炮炮弹”。
    事实上，我方的军事目标不是设立坚强的武装防御，就是隐蔽、保护得很好，美国空军根本不敢或无法进行破坏。纽约时报早在八月三日就已承认：
    “北朝鲜的良好军事目标很少了”。因为，就像路透社七月二十二日电所承认的：“共军的重要供应都深藏地底，有崇山峻岭保护”，而“共军和他们的供应大队，即使天气晴朗也几乎看不出”。
    美国空军的狂轰滥炸在军事上既然不起作用，也炸不到军事目标，其唯一的目标当然就是朝鲜的老弱妇孺。这一事实“纽约时报”也无法掩饰，该报二十六日索兴公然承认美机“加紧进行空袭”的目的，就是为了要“屠杀”“无辜的人民”。该报并竭力企图将这种灭绝人性的“屠杀”说成是正当的。该报说：“北朝鲜对联合国加紧进行空袭的抗议，我们认为不能从表面上来看便加以接受。”它的所谓理由是：“由于战争性质的改变，……战争不再是由一小批职业军人来打，而是由全体人民来打了。”因此，“无辜的人民就注定了要遭受苦难”。该报说美国侵略者为了要达到它的目的，“不得不夺掉他们（指朝鲜人民）的生命”。该报并狰狞毕露地扬言：美国侵略者决心继续这种“屠杀”。纽约时报在这里赤裸裸地招供了美国侵略者的罪恶图谋，这就是：鉴于朝鲜人民万众一心地抗击美国的侵略，并严正拒绝美方企图扣留我方战俘的无理主张，美国侵略者决心以对全体朝鲜人民进行疯狂屠杀的血腥罪行，以达到破坏谈判、扩大战争的目的。
    美国第五航空队司令巴喀斯二十四日在谈到轰炸七十八个城市的血腥计划时又扬言：“或许有其他的地方将加到这个名单中来。”这就暴露出美国强盗还阴谋更加扩大他们的屠杀和平居民的范围。事实说明：美国空军正加紧实施对朝鲜和平城镇与妇孺老弱的轰炸，美机连日对平壤及其附近的和平城乡进行了惨无人道的轰炸扫射。以二十七日清晨的轰炸为例，美机对居民集中的平壤市西区投弹三百八十多枚，老弱妇孺多人在睡梦中躲避不及，惨遭毒手。
    美方把朝鲜和平城镇说成是“军事目标”的谎言已经彻底破产，而他们自己已开始公然承认他们的目的就是要屠杀和平居民。这样，美国的屠夫们就用自己的手摘下了伪装“人道”的假面具，他们就更加无法逃脱全世界人民的正义制裁。
