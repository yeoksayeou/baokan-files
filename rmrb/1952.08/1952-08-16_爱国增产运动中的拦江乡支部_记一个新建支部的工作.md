    The Lanjiang Township Branch in the Patriotic Production Increase Campaign
    ——A Record of a Newly Established Branch's Work
    The Lanjiang Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Suining County, Sichuan Province, was established in March of this year. Each member of the branch had been tempered by a series of struggles such as rent reduction and deposit refunds, and land reform. They clearly recognized the role of the Party in rural areas, and understood that the leadership center of the branch was to lead the masses to organize and increase production. Therefore, after the establishment of this branch, it organized the farmers of the entire township to launch a vigorous patriotic production increase campaign.
    When carrying out the drought resistance and prevention campaign, the Lanjiang Township Branch publicized the principle that to overcome drought, it is necessary to organize. At the same time, all members of the Lanjiang Township Branch played a leading role. In this way, the entire township quickly launched a drought resistance and prevention campaign, ensuring that all rice seedlings were transplanted on time. At the enlarged cadre meeting of the entire township on April 19, the branch organized model mutual aid team leader and Communist Party member Wu Xiangui and others to report on model deeds of organizing to fight drought and prevent drought. Wu Xiangui also issued a production increase challenge to the mutual aid teams in the entire township, which immediately aroused everyone's enthusiasm for increasing production, and unanimously responded to launch a production increase competition campaign. Some villages that originally emphasized insufficient preparation work also put forward the slogan "Learn from Wu Xiangui's Mutual Aid Team."
    At this time, the Lanjiang Township Branch paid attention to strengthening ideological and political work for carrying out the patriotic production increase campaign, in order to ensure the smooth development of this movement. First of all, at the branch general meeting, the experience of the Wu Xiangui mutual aid team was further discussed and summarized; and it was emphasized that the reason why the Wu Xiangui mutual aid team and the village where it was located were able to obtain the title of model in production was because they adopted the good method of "organization." After all party members deeply understood the correctness of the "organization" policy, the branch called on everyone to consciously participate in mutual aid teams and use their own exemplary actions to promote the patriotic production increase campaign. The branch also suggested that the government call on all township cadres and labor models to actively participate in mutual aid teams to strengthen the leadership of the patriotic production increase campaign. Secondly, the Lanjiang Township Branch learned from the typical experiments in leading and organizing mutual aid teams that some farmers lacked confidence in increasing production, and they said: "The harvest will not be good this year, and we will not be able to produce much grain." The branch organized farmers who had obtained high yields last year and members of mutual aid teams who had already formulated production increase plans to carry out production increase publicity at various meetings, and mobilized primary school teachers and radio station personnel to help publicize the government's production policies. Communist Party members, Youth League members, labor models, and activists were organized to go deep into various groups and households to explain the conditions for increasing production by means of accounting. After extensive and repeated publicity and education, the masses' confidence in increasing production was enhanced. For example, Chen Zongyun of the eighth village originally had no confidence, but after publicity and education, Chen Zongyun's enthusiasm for increasing production was very high, and he automatically proposed to compete with everyone in farming.
    In early May, the Lanjiang Township Patriotic Production Increase Competition Campaign officially began, and the Lanjiang Township Branch did a lot of work. For example, it organized the promotion of the fertilizer accumulation experience of the Jiang Senrong Mutual Aid Team in Lianhua Township, and organized the mutual aid team leaders of the entire township to hold meetings every half month to exchange advanced experience, and so on.
    At the end of May, the patriotic production increase campaign in Lanjiang Township was fully launched. There were forty-one mutual aid teams and twenty-five high-yield households in the township, all of which were involved in the upsurge of the patriotic production increase competition campaign. At that time, the production increase competition campaign powerfully promoted spring plowing and production work. Taking the mid-cultivation and weeding as an example, the entire township's paddy fields and cotton fields completed the second weeding work before the Dragon Boat Festival, and some had already begun the third weeding work. The farming work was done very well, and everyone said: "There has never been such careful farming work!" A new atmosphere appeared in production throughout the township.
    In leading the patriotic production increase campaign, the Lanjiang Township Branch also had some shortcomings or mistakes. For example, in the initial publicity for increasing production, it failed to combine it with patriotic education, and there was a tendency to simply encourage production from the perspective of the farmers' personal interests. However, because the branch was able to pay attention to leading everyone to study the instructions from higher authorities in a timely manner, these shortcomings and mistakes were corrected in a timely manner, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the patriotic production increase campaign.

    爱国增产运动中的拦江乡支部
    ——记一个新建支部的工作
    中共四川遂宁县拦江乡支部是今年三月建立的。支部的每个党员都经过了减租退押、土地改革等一系列的斗争的锻炼，他们明确认识了党在农村中的作用，认识了支部的领导中心就是领导群众组织起来、增加生产。因而这个支部建立以后，就组织全乡农民开展了轰轰烈烈的爱国增产运动。
    在开展抗旱防旱运动时，拦江乡支部宣传了要想战胜天旱必须组织起来的道理。同时，拦江乡支部的全体党员也发挥了带头作用，这样全乡很快展开了抗旱防旱运动，保证了全部秧田按时插上秧。在四月十九日全乡扩大干部会议上，支部又组织模范互助组长、共产党员吴先贵等报告了组织起来抗旱防旱的模范事迹。吴先贵并向全乡互助组提出了增产挑战，当即激起了大家的增产劲头，一致响应开展增产竞赛运动。有的村原来强调准备工作不够，这时也提出了“向吴先贵互助组学习”的口号。
    这时，拦江乡支部就注意到加强对开展爱国增产运动的思想政治工作，以保证这一运动的顺利开展。首先在支部大会上，进一步讨论和总结了吴先贵互助组的经验；并着重指出了吴先贵互助组和他所在村所以能够在生产上获得模范称号，就因为采用了“组织起来”的好办法。在全体党员深刻体会到了“组织起来”方针的正确性以后，支部就号召大家自觉参加到互助组里去，以自己的模范行动来推动爱国增产运动前进。支部又建议政府号召全乡的干部和劳动模范积极参加互助组，以加强对爱国增产运动的领导。其次，拦江乡支部在领导组织互助组的典型试验中了解到一部分农民对增产缺乏信心，他们说：“今年年成不好，出不到很多粮食。”支部就组织了去年获得很高产量的农民和已经订出增产计划的互助组的成员，在各种会议上进行增产宣传，并发动小学教师、广播站的人员帮助宣传政府的生产政策，组织共产党员、青年团员、劳动模范、积极分子深入各组、各户用算账的办法说明增产是有条件的。经过多方面的、反复的宣传教育，群众的增产信心提高了。例如八村陈宗云原先没有信心，经过宣传教育后，陈宗云的增产劲头很大，自动地提出了要和大家的庄稼比个高低。
    五月初，拦江乡爱国增产竞赛运动正式开始，拦江乡支部又作了不少工作。例如组织推广莲花乡姜森荣互助组的积肥经验，组织全乡互助组长每半月开会一次，以交流先进经验，等等。
    五月底，拦江乡的爱国增产运动全面地展开了，全乡有四十一个互助组，二十五户丰产户，都投入了爱国增产竞赛运动热潮。当时，增产竞赛运动有力地推动了春耕生产工作。仅以中耕锄草一项为例，全乡水田和棉田在端午节前，就完成了第二次薅秧锄草工作，并且有一部分已开始第三次锄草工作。庄稼活作得很好，大家说：“从来没有这么仔细的庄稼活！”全乡在生产上出现了新的气象。
    拦江乡支部在领导爱国增产运动中，也发生过一些缺点或错误。例如：初期宣传增产时，不能和爱国主义的教育结合进行，有单纯从农民的个人利益出发鼓动增产的偏向。可是因为支部能够及时注意领导大家学习上级的指示，这些缺点和错误都及时地纠正了，因而保证了爱国增产运动顺利地进行。
