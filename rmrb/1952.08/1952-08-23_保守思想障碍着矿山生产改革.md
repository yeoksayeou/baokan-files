    Conservative Ideology Hinders Mine Production Reform

    To the Editor: As early as the second half of 1950, the Jingxing Coal Mine received instructions from higher leading organs regarding "production reform," aiming to transform this coal mine, which relied entirely on manual coal mining, into a mechanized, new-method coal mine. However, the mine delayed for nearly two years before fully implementing production reform in the First Mine in June of this year.

    Why did this happen? Because the mine's technical personnel harbored serious conservative ideas. They believed that "machines are too troublesome; manual labor is more convenient." Therefore, they left the newly equipped machines unused for a long time. For example, when the electric locomotives used for transporting coal in the mining area broke down, they did not repair them but instead replaced them with child labor pulling carts. They refused to use the new coal cutting machines, preferring to use manual drilling and blasting. Even Soviet-made pneumatic picks and drills were deemed "unusable" and left in the warehouse, forcing workers to produce with hand picks and hand drills. Last year, when the mine switched from donkey and horse-powered transportation to mechanized circulating rope transportation, poor design led to frequent accidents, causing some to believe that "donkeys and horses are still more convenient." Although the mine has now begun to use advanced production tools, the attitude of the technical personnel remains indifferent. Instead of seriously studying the performance of various new machines and quickly helping workers master the technology, they seek various excuses to delay and resist.

    The conservative thinking of the technical personnel is also reflected in their failure to fully utilize existing equipment. The First Mine still uses a steam-powered water pump underground, a machine used before electric water pumps were available. Using the steam-powered water pump causes the temperature inside the mine to reach as high as 35 degrees Celsius, affecting the health of the workers and violating coal mine safety regulations. Workers and the work team from the Coal Mine Administration Bureau have repeatedly raised concerns and suggested that the mine could adjust the existing electric water pumps to eliminate the need for this old machine. However, the technical personnel remain reluctant to part with the old machine. Furthermore, due to poor ventilation in the mine, workers often suffer from headaches due to the lack of fresh air. However, the technical personnel are afraid to use the 450-horsepower blower to its full potential, running it at only 224 revolutions per minute, using only 143 horsepower, arguing that "the Germans used to run it like this, and the Japanese only dared to run it like this. Now that the machine is old, how can we dare to run it faster?" After research by the ventilation work team of the Coal Mine Administration Bureau, it was found that the blower could run at 325 revolutions per minute, using up to 436 horsepower, which would fully guarantee sufficient air volume underground. Due to the resistance of the technical personnel's conservative thinking, Jingxing Mine failed to complete the new-method coal mining production tasks set by the higher authorities in the first half of this year, which is a serious loss.

    Why do these technical personnel believe that "machines are not as good as donkeys and horses?" Because they are satisfied with existing production methods and levels and have lost sensitivity to new things; because they blindly believe in the technical standards of Germany and Japan and lack understanding of advanced Soviet production experience; because they are only producing for the sake of production and do not truly understand the significant meaning of reforming production for the construction of the motherland. This is the contradiction between old and new ideas, that is, the contradiction between old and new standpoints and viewpoints. In order to better发挥发挥the role of technical personnel in the construction of the motherland, we believe that these technical personnel must transform their thinking. They should not only establish a viewpoint of serving the people, but also thoroughly eliminate old technical viewpoints.

### 保守思想障碍着矿山生产改革

    保守思想障碍着矿山生产改革
    编辑同志：远在一九五○年下半年，井陉煤矿便接到上级领导机关关于“改革生产”的指示，要把这个全靠人力采煤的矿山，改变为机械化新法采煤的矿山。但该矿拖延了将近两年，才于今年六月间在第一矿开始进行全面的生产改革。
    为什么会这样呢？因为该矿的技术人员存在着严重的保守思想。他们认为“机器太麻烦，不如人力方便”。因此，他们把新配备的机器，长期搁置不用。例如，采煤场上运煤用的电镏子出了毛病，他们不加修理，反而以童工拉斗子代替电镏子。他们放着新式的割煤机不使用，宁愿用人工打眼放炮。甚至苏联的风镐、风钻也被认为“不好使”而搁在仓库里，让工人用手镐、手钻生产。去年该矿改驴马力运输为机械的循环绳运输时，由于设计不善，常出事故，因此有人就认为“还是驴马方便”。现在该矿虽已开始使用先进生产工具，但技术人员的态度始终是冷淡的。他们不是认真研究各种新机械的性能，迅速帮助工人掌握技术，而是寻觅各种藉口拖延、抵抗。
    技术人员的保守思想，还表现在对旧有设备的不能充分利用。第一矿井下至今还使用着一架蒸气抽水机，这种机器是在没有电力抽水机以前才使用的。使用蒸气抽水机，矿内温度就会高达摄氏三十五度，影响工人们的健康，是违犯煤矿保安规程的。工人和煤矿管理总局工作组曾不断提出意见，并建议该矿调整一下现有的电力抽水机就可以不用这个旧机器了。但技术人员对旧机器却始终恋恋不舍。又如，该矿井下因通风不良，工人得不到新鲜空气，常常头痛。可是技术人员却不敢把四百五十匹马力的一架送风机发挥它应有的效能，每分钟只开二百二十四转，只使用一百四十三匹马力，理由是“过去德国人这样开，日本人也只敢这样开，现在机器旧了，我们怎敢开快”。经过煤矿管理总局通风工作组的研究，这架送风机每分钟可以开三百二十五转，可以用到四百三十六匹马力，这样就完全可以保证井下有充足的风量。由于技术人员保守思想的抵抗，今年上半年井陉矿因此没有完成上级所规定的新法采煤生产的任务，这是严重的损失。
    为什么这些技术人员认为“机器不如驴马”呢？因为他们满足于既有的生产方法和水平，对新事物失去了敏感；因为他们迷信德国和日本人的技术标准，对苏联先进生产经验缺乏认识；因为他们只是为生产而生产，并不真正了解改革生产对建设祖国的重大意义。这是新旧思想的矛盾，也就是新旧立场和观点的矛盾。为了更好地发挥技术人员在祖国建设中的作用，我们认为这些技术人员必须改造思想，不仅应该树立为人民服务的观点，同时还必须彻底肃清旧技术观点。马赐声　蔡新贞
