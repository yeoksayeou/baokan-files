    Break the Old Habit of "Hanging Up the Hoe After the Autumn Begins"
    Editor: "Hanging up the hoe after the Autumn Begins" is a common old farming habit among farmers. They believe that after the Autumn Begins, the fate of the crops is sealed, and human effort can no longer make a difference. In reality, this is a conservative idea. After the Autumn Begins, it is the final stage to realize patriotic production increase, and we should seize this short period of time, make a final effort, and strive to complete the patriotic production increase plan. Therefore, the Ping Shun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province decided to launch a mass "crop inspection and yield estimation" campaign throughout the county. County and district cadres go deep into the villages, organize village cadres, model laborers, mutual aid team leaders, and a portion of the masses, and go to the fields of each high-yield team and high-yield household to conduct on-site investigations, carefully examine the effectiveness of cultivation and fertilization, and then calculate whether the yield can meet the requirements of the production increase plan based on the crop conditions. If any are found to be unqualified, they are urged to quickly process and add fertilizer. The county and district leaders also organize the masses of other villages to visit the farming conditions of the high-yield villages to spread advanced production experience.

    Editor's Note: The "crop inspection and yield estimation" method launched in Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province is very good, and all localities can adopt it at their discretion.

    打破“立上秋挂锄钩”的旧习惯
    编辑同志：“立上秋、挂锄钩”是一般农民旧的耕作习惯。他们认为立秋以后，庄稼好坏已成定局，人力再不能有所作为了。其实，这是一种保守思想。立秋以后正是实现爱国增产的最后阶段，应该抓紧这个短促时间，最后努一把力，争取完成爱国增产计划。因此，中共山西平顺县委员会决定在全县展开一个群众性的“查苗定产”运动。由县、区干部深入到各村，组织村干部、劳动模范、互助组长和一部分群众，分头到各丰产组、丰产户的地里去实地调查，仔细检验耕作、施肥的效果，然后根据庄稼的情况，计算产量是否可达到增产计划的要求。如发现有不合格的，就督促他们迅速加工加肥。县、区领导方面还组织别村群众参观各丰产村的耕作情形，以传播先进生产经验。

    编者按：山西平顺县，发动的“查苗定产”的办法很好，各地可斟酌采用。
