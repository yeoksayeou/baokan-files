Supporting the Launch of the Judicial Reform Movement
—Reader Letters Summary

Since our newspaper published “National Judicial Reform Movement to be Launched” and related reports starting August 17th, readers have sent letters to our newspaper, expressing their support for launching this movement.

Zhou Meigan from the General Anti-Epidemic Team of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government wrote:

“After reading the accusations of Zhang Zaixiang and Han Xiuying, family members of revolutionary martyrs, against He Bin, President of the Liuhe County People's Court, and Yan Siping, Judge of the Nanjing Municipal People's Court, it aroused boundless resentment in my heart! Recalling 1933, I was also oppressed and tortured by reactionaries and bullies in my hometown, Pujiang County, Zhejiang Province, and the Communist Party avenged me later. Facing the grievances of Zhang Zaixiang and Han Xiuying, I couldn't help but shed tears. We fully support launching a judicial reform movement throughout the country.” Yu Jinhun, a student of the Law Department of Renmin University of China, wrote: “The illegal and undisciplined, corrupt and degenerate phenomena of judicial personnel in people's courts in Xuzhou and other places, as reported in the People's Daily in recent days, are truly intolerable. These bad elements have caused immeasurable losses to the Party and the People's Courts. If these garbage in the judicial organs are not thoroughly eliminated, the people's judicial work cannot be further improved and consolidated organizationally and ideologically, and the upcoming construction upsurge of the motherland cannot be effectively coordinated. I am a future judicial cadre, and I am determined to overcome all non-proletarian ideologies and work styles, learn lessons from these painful facts published in the People's Daily, be vigilant at all times, and strive to study Mao Zedong Thought and judicial work, preparing to be a judicial worker loyal to the people.” Dong Yulin from the Eleventh District People's Government of Beijing wrote: “If we do not thoroughly reform judicial institutions like the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court, the people will be even more afraid to speak, and counter-revolutionaries and illegal bourgeois elements will be even more lawless.” Zhang Zhenggang, a student of the Department of Oriental Languages ​​at Peking University, wrote: “The criminal acts of He Bin, President of the Liuhe County People's Court, and Yan Siping, Judge of the Nanjing Municipal People's Court, and others who shielded counter-revolutionaries, made me extremely angry. I demand that the People's Government severely punish bad judicial personnel like He Bin.” Yang Jingmei, a student at Beijing Railway College, wrote:

“After seeing reports such as ‘The Xuzhou Municipal People’s Court is Corrupt and Deteriorated and Should Be Thoroughly Reconstructed,’ I have a clearer understanding of the importance of carrying out the judicial reform movement. These serious impure phenomena in the judicial organs are absolutely intolerable. Therefore, we fully support the correct measures taken by the Central People's Government to lead people's courts at all levels to carry out thorough reconstruction and rectification."

    拥护开展司法改革运动
    ——读者来信综述
    本报自八月十七日起刊载“全国将展开司法改革运动”和有关报道以来，读者纷纷给本报来信，拥护开展这一运动。
    中央人民政府卫生部防疫总队周美淦来信说：
    “看了革命烈士家属张在祥、韩秀英对六合县人民法院院长何斌及南京市人民法院审判员晏嗣平的控诉后，激起了我心头无比的愤恨！回想一九三三年时，我也曾经在我的家乡浙江省浦江县被反动派、恶霸欺压折磨过，共产党来后才给我报了仇。面对张在祥、韩秀英的冤屈，我不禁热泪直流。我们完全拥护在全国开展一次司法改革运动。”中国人民大学法律学系学生余劲魂来信说：“连日来人民日报刊载的徐州市等地人民法院司法人员的违法乱纪、腐烂变质现象，实令人难于容忍。这些坏蛋给党和人民法院造成无可计量的损失。如果不彻底肃清这些司法机关中的垃圾，就不能使人民的司法工作从组织上、思想上获得进一步的健全和巩固，就不能有效地配合即将到来的祖国的建设高潮。我是未来的司法干部，我决心克服一切非无产阶级的思想作风，从人民日报上所刊载的这些沉痛的事实中取得教训，时刻警惕自己，努力学习毛泽东思想和司法业务，准备作一个忠实于人民的司法工作者。”北京市第十一区人民政府董毓麟来信说：“如果我们不彻底改革徐州市人民法院之类的司法机构，人民更要不敢说话了，反革命分子、不法资产阶级分子更要无法无天了。”北京大学东方语文学系学生张正纲来信说：“六合县人民法院院长何斌及南京市人民法院审判员晏嗣平等包庇反革命的犯罪事实，使我愤怒极了。我要求人民政府严厉惩处何斌之流的坏司法人员。”北京铁道学院学生杨景嵋来信说：
    “当我看到‘徐州市人民法院腐烂变质应进行彻底改造’等报道后，更清楚地认识到开展司法改革运动的重要性。这些司法机关中的严重不纯现象，是绝对不能容忍的。因此，我们完全拥护中央人民政府领导各级人民法院进行彻底改造和整顿的正确措施。”
