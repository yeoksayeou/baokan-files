Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: Under the direction of its American masters, the Syngman Rhee gang in South Korea staged a farcical so-called "presidential election." Syngman Rhee, who was once an American citizen, was re-"elected" as "president," and Ham Tae-young, who repeatedly ordered the shooting of demonstrating workers in Seoul and Busan, was "elected" as "vice president." On the 15th, Syngman Rhee made a pompous appearance in Seoul, holding a so-called "inauguration ceremony." The real rulers of southern Korea—Clark, Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea, and Van Fleet, Commander of the Eighth Army—were both present to oversee the event.

Even judging from the so-called "inauguration ceremony" held by Syngman Rhee, one can see how unpopular this American lackey is and how much he fears the people. According to the Associated Press, before the "inauguration ceremony," the police authorities had "ordered a thousand police officers to search the mountains and cities in the Seoul area for troublemakers." While forcing the people of Seoul to "participate in the ceremony" to put on a show, Syngman Rhee was also terrified, using "an entire division of South Korean troops" to "protect" himself. While he was delivering his speech, "troops of the Republic of Korea on the roof of the National Assembly building stood behind machine guns, watching the crowd below." Some people "entered the empty space inside the National Assembly building," and "national police and soldiers searched them at the door to see if they had any hidden weapons." Under the protection of machine guns and batons, Syngman Rhee ascended to the seat of the puppet "president."

The absurdity and ugliness of the so-called "presidential election" held by the Syngman Rhee gang this time is rarely seen in the world. Both the situation before and during the "election" clearly illustrate this point. Just before this election, at the end of May, a fierce conflict of power and mutual infighting occurred within the Syngman Rhee gang. At that time, Syngman Rhee's term as puppet president was about to expire, and according to the puppet constitution, a new president had to be elected by the puppet National Assembly. However, because anti-Rhee faction members held the majority in the puppet National Assembly, the National Assembly "probably would not re-elect Syngman Rhee, nor would it let him designate his successor." Therefore, Syngman Rhee proposed a so-called constitutional amendment, advocating that the puppet president be directly elected so that he could unscrupulously manipulate the election and maintain his power. This proposal was opposed by anti-Rhee faction puppet assembly members, who launched a fierce attack on Syngman Rhee, denouncing him as a "muddled dictator." Syngman Rhee retorted, attacking the opposition puppet assembly members for "accepting bribes," and he arrested a large number of opposition members. After a dog-eat-dog struggle, with the help of his American masters, Syngman Rhee used force to drag all the assembly members to the National Assembly, and Syngman Rhee's proposal was forcibly passed.

It was under such circumstances that Syngman Rhee staged a "election" farce in South Korea on August 5th. Needless to say, this "election" had nothing to do with the South Korean people. In the "election," only a few vicious dogs in the Syngman Rhee gang were scheming against each other and using all kinds of despicable and dirty means to compete for the two stinking bones of puppet "president" and "vice president." Cho Bong-am, who competed with Syngman Rhee to be the puppet president, was a close friend of American Ambassador Muccio and MacArthur and had shared the gold and silver treasures stolen from the Bank of Korea with MacArthur. During the "campaign," he fiercely attacked the Syngman Rhee regime as a "thoroughly degenerate" regime. According to a United Press International dispatch from Busan on the 7th, he "immediately went into hiding" after the "election." Cho Bong-am's "secretary" also angrily denounced "government police for interfering with Cho's campaign." "He said: Armed personnel broke into Cho's campaign office in Incheon and forced the staff to leave." Lee Bum-suk, a "petty gangster," was the fiercest competitor for the puppet vice president with Ham Tae-young. Lee Bum-suk, the leader of this fascist terrorist youth organization, also angrily denounced the police for interfering with his campaign activities. According to Reuters, "Lee Bum-suk's campaign staff has filed a lawsuit in court against three senior government officials for obstructing his campaign for vice president. They claim that Prime Minister Chang Taek-sang, Minister of Home Affairs Kim Tae-sun, and National Police Chief ordered the national police to interfere with the work of Lee Bum-suk's campaign staff. They claim that several staff members have been arrested by the police." At the same time, according to a International News Service dispatch from Busan on the 7th, a "leader" of a South Korean women's group said, "The powerful national police organization in Jeolla Nam-do, which is threatened by guerrillas, forced voters to vote for Ham Tae-young, otherwise they would be arrested as Communists who aided the guerrillas." In this way, the bones were finally snatched by Syngman Rhee and Ham Tae-young, who were favored by their American masters.

The "election farce" staged with the support of bayonets and batons has come to an end. The smoggy, corrupt, and utterly rotten essence of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, which was fostered by the American aggressors, has been fully exposed to the world.

### 南朝鲜伪总统选举丑剧收场  美国奴才李承晚靠武力“当选总统”

    南朝鲜伪总统选举丑剧收场
    美国奴才李承晚靠武力“当选总统”
    【新华社十八日讯】南朝鲜李承晚匪帮在美国主子的导演下，演出了一出所谓“总统选举”的丑剧。曾经是美国公民的李承晚重新“当选”为“总统”，多次枪击汉城和釜山的示威工人的咸台永“当选”为“副总统”。十五日，李承晚在汉城袍笏登场，举行所谓“就职典礼”，朝鲜南部的真正统治者——侵朝美军总司令克拉克和第八军军长范佛里特都到场监视。
    就从李承晚举行的这个所谓“就职典礼”来看，也可以看出这个美国奴才是如何不得人心而又如何畏惧人民。据美联社消息：在举行“就职典礼”以前，警察当局就已“命令一千名警察在汉城地区的山上和城市中搜索捣乱分子”。在举行“典礼”时，李承晚一面强迫汉城人民“参加典礼”来装点门面，一面又心惊胆战，用了“整整一师南朝鲜军队”来“保护”自己。在他发表演说时，“国会大厦屋顶上的大韩民国部队站在机关枪后面，注视着下面的群众”。一部分人“进入国会大厦里面的空场”，“国家警察和兵士在门口搜查他们，看看有没有隐藏武器”。在机关枪和警棍的保护下，李承晚登上了伪“总统”的座位。
    李承晚匪帮这次举行的所谓“总统选举”的荒唐和丑恶，是世间少有的。无论是“选举”前或者“选举”中的情形都清楚地说明了这一点。就在这次选举之前，五月底，李承晚匪帮内部曾发生了一场激烈的争权夺利、互相倾轧的冲突。当时，李承晚的伪总统任期即将届满，按照伪宪法，须由伪国会选出新总统。但由于伪国会内反李派议员占有优势，国会“大概不会重选李承晚，也不会让他指定他的继任人”，因此，李承晚提出所谓宪法修正案，主张伪总统改为直接选举，以便从中肆无忌惮地操纵，保持自己的权位。这个提案遭到反李派伪议员的反对，他们对李承晚大肆攻击，斥为“糊涂独裁者”。李承晚反唇相讥，攻击反对派伪议员“收受贿赂”，他并逮捕了大批反对派的议员。经过一场狗咬狗的斗争，在美国主子的帮助下，李承晚使用武力，把所有的议员都抓到国会，李承晚的提案才被强迫通过。
    就在这样的情况下，李承晚八月五日在南朝鲜演出了一幕“选举”丑剧。不用说，这种“选举”与南朝鲜人民是没有任何关系的。在“选举”中，只有李承晚匪帮中的几条恶狗勾心斗角、用尽卑鄙龌龊手段来争夺伪“总统”、“副总统”两块臭骨头。与李承晚争当伪总统的曹奉岩，他是美国大使缪锡俄和麦克阿瑟的密友，曾和麦克阿瑟分享从朝鲜银行窃取到的金银财宝。他在“竞选”中大肆攻击李承晚政权是“恶劣透顶”的政权。而据合众社釜山七日电透露：他在“选举”后立即“躲起来了”。曹奉岩的“秘书”并大骂“政府警察对曹的竞选运动横加干涉”。“他说：武装人员在仁川闯进曹的选举办事处，并强迫办事人员走出。”争夺伪副总统最凶的是咸台永与“小流氓”李范奭。李范奭，这个法西斯恐怖青年组织的首领也痛骂警察干涉他的竞选活动。据路透社说，“李范奭的选举办事人员已向法院控告三位政府高级官员阻碍他竞选副总统的活动。他们声称总理张泽相、内务部长官金泰善和国家警察总监命令国家警察干涉李范奭竞选运动的工作人员。他们声称：有几个工作人员已被警察逮捕。”同时，据国际新闻社釜山七日电透露：南朝鲜一个妇女团体的“领袖”说，“在受游击队威胁的全罗南道的强大国家警察组织，强迫选民投咸台永的票，否则就把他们当作援助游击队的共产党而加以逮捕。”这样，骨头终于被美国主子宠爱的李承晚与咸台永抢到。
    在刺刀和警棍的支持下上演的“选举丑剧”至此收场，而这个为美国侵略者一手扶植起来的李承晚傀儡政权的乌烟瘴气、腐败透顶的本质，也就已充分暴露在世人面前。
