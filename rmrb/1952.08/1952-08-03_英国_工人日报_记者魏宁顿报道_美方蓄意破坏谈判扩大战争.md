British "Worker's Daily" Reporter Weinington Reports:

    U.S. Intentionally Sabotages Negotiations and Expands War

    (Xinhua News Agency, 2nd) London "Worker's Daily" reporter Weinington reported from Kaesong on the 1st: The U.S. side unilaterally insisted on a one-week adjournment of the talks, which expires this Sunday. However, all indications point to the U.S. intention to sabotage the negotiations and expand the Korean War. It is noteworthy that the U.S. is attempting to blame the Korean and Chinese side for their withdrawal from the tent last week, insisting that the efforts of the Korean and Chinese side to have staff officers resolve technical issues while buying time were the cause of the week's delay. Observers here are extremely interested in the "New York Times" editorial of July 31st. Like Van Fleet's hawkish remarks at a press conference on July 30th, the "New York Times" called for more military action. The newspaper deliberately distorted the attitude of the Korean and Chinese side, saying that the Korean and Chinese side "began to demand revisions to previous agreements." At the same time, the "New York Times," which has close ties with the U.S. decision-making authorities, stated that the U.S. side advocated dragging the resolution here until after the U.S. election. The "New York Times" has no excuse for saying that its news is unreliable regarding the negotiations, because the newspaper has a reporter stationed in Panmunjom. Therefore, this lie is deliberately fabricated. The Korean and Chinese side have never wanted to revise any agreement that has already been reached. To achieve peace here, the U.S. only needs to abandon its absurd views on the POW issue and put forward a realistic number of POWs to be repatriated, including all foreign POWs. However, not only did they not do so, but they also continued to massacre POWs in their POW camps, and sent more than a hundred aircraft to invade Northeast China and indiscriminately bomb the Chinese Northeast border. Moreover, only a day or two after Fay Tayleur said the exact opposite, Van Fleet came out again to deny any possibility of achieving an armistice here.

    Wall Street and the leaders of the Republican Party, and even the Democratic Party, are also trying to hand over the entire White House to Eisenhower and the Pentagon, and are trying to obstruct the realization of a Korean armistice at all costs. There is no doubt that these actions of the U.S. are related to these attempts. Harrison's task in Panmunjom is to delay, adjourn, fabricate obvious lies, and insist at all costs on the U.S.'s particularly elaborately manufactured unacceptable so-called "voluntary repatriation," which is actually the claim of detaining POWs.

### 英国“工人日报”记者魏宁顿报道  美方蓄意破坏谈判扩大战争

    英国“工人日报”记者魏宁顿报道
    美方蓄意破坏谈判扩大战争
    【新华社二日讯】伦敦“工人日报”记者魏宁顿一日自开城报道：美方片面强要朝中方面休会一星期，这次休会到星期日就满期了，但是一切迹象指明，美方的意图是想破坏谈判并且扩大朝鲜战争。值得注意的是，美方企图把他们上星期退出帐篷的行动诿过于朝中方面，硬说朝中方面要使参谋官员把技术问题加以解决同时争取时间的努力是一星期拖延的原因。此间观察家对“纽约时报”七月三十
    一日的社论极感兴味。“纽约时报”像范佛里特于七月三十日在记者招待会上发表的好战谈话一样，要求采取更多的军事行动。该报故意歪曲朝中方面的态度，竟说朝中方面“开始要求修改以前的协议”。同时，这家与美国决策当局关系密切的“纽约时报”表示，美方主张把这里的解决拖到美国大选以后。关于谈判，“纽约时报”是没有藉口说它消息不灵通的，因为该报有一个记者长驻在板门店，因此这个谎话是蓄意捏造的。朝中方面从来没有要想修改已经获得的任何协议。要使此间得到和平，美方只需要丢弃他们在战俘问题上的荒谬观点，提出包括全部外国战俘在内的应予遣返的战俘的现实数字。但是，他们不但没有这样做，反而又在屠杀他们战俘营中的战俘，又派一百多架飞机侵入中国东北，并在中国东北边界进行滥炸，而且在费泰勒说了截然相反的话不到一二天，又叫范佛里特出来否认这里有获致停战的任何可能性。
    华尔街和共和党，甚至民主党的领导人物也在努力想把白宫整个交给艾森豪威尔和五角大楼，并且努力想不惜一切代价阻挠朝鲜停战的实现。无可怀疑，美方的这些行动是与这些企图有关连的。哈利逊在板门店的任务是拖延、休会、捏造显而易见的谎言，而且不惜一切代价坚持美方特别精心制造出来的令人不可接受的所谓“自愿遣返”实际上就是扣留战俘的主张。
