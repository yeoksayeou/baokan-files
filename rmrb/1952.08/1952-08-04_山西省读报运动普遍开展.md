    Reading Newspapers Movement Universally Launched in Shanxi Province
    Comrade Editor: The reading newspaper activity in the vast urban and rural areas of Shanxi Province has formed a mass movement. According to incomplete statistics in June, there were more than 38,000 reading groups with 700,000 members, subscribing to more than 390,000 copies of various newspapers and periodicals (excluding city newspapers), averaging one newspaper or periodical for every 30 people. This is the result of the gradual improvement of the people's political consciousness and the increasing economic life since liberation, as well as the urgent demand for culture. The reading newspaper movement in Ping順 [Píngshùn] County is a clear example. Before liberation, Ping順 County was a well-known impoverished area where farmers generally could not even get enough to eat, let alone study. After liberation, the economic life of the farmers in Ping順 County improved through land reform and the great production movement, their political interest increased, and their demand for cultural life became more urgent. By May of this year, this county with a population of 100,000 had already organized 1,502 reading groups, subscribing to 4,897 copies of various newspapers and periodicals, with more than 56,000 people participating in reading. The development of the reading newspaper movement in cities is even more rapid. All of the more than 200 employees of Taiyuan Railway Station participated in reading groups, subscribing to 137 newspapers, averaging two newspapers for every three people.
    Carrying out reading newspaper work is an important method to improve the people's political consciousness and promote various tasks. This spring, the members of the Dong Taoqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangjiazhuang Village, Licheng County, developed serious capitalist ideas. Many people believed that "to get rich, you have to buy land." The members' congress of this cooperative decided to buy 30 mu of land. The masses said, "The land cooperative has become the first big landlord, and in a few years, it will buy all the land in the village." Later, this cooperative established a reading group. After the members studied the articles published in the newspaper about criticizing capitalist ideas in agricultural production cooperatives, they immediately understood and decided not to buy land anymore, but to use the accumulated funds to process the land in order to increase the yield per unit area.
    The farmers of Yaojiazhuang Village in Anyi County understood the benefits of organizing mutual aid teams during the process of reading newspapers. The number of mutual aid teams in the whole village quickly increased from 12 to 25, and 80% of the labor force participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the village studied the cotton seedling close planting method of Qu Yaoli, a model of high cotton yield, laying the foundation for this year's bumper cotton harvest.
    The reason why the reading newspaper work in Shanxi Province can form a mass movement and achieve certain results is first of all due to the attention paid to this work by party committees at all levels. In the 1952 propaganda network work plan of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, it was emphasized that all grassroots party organizations in the province should strengthen the leadership of reading newspaper work; and it was specifically stipulated that the whole province should organize 1.5 million to 2 million people to participate in reading groups by the end of 1952. On May 14th, the Provincial Party Committee issued a "Notice on Universally Promoting Reading Newspaper and Communication Work" to the municipal and district party committees. The municipal, district, and county party committees have formulated plans for carrying out reading newspaper work according to the specific conditions of their localities, and have established a series of guidance, transmission, and inspection work systems to ensure the development and consolidation of reading groups. Many rural and factory party branches have established reading newspaper guidance committees and reading newspaper transmission stations to summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner and strengthen ideological leadership of reading newspaper work. Second, it is because reading newspaper work is combined with the party's propaganda network work. Party organizations in various places have designated current affairs propaganda as one of the regular and main contents of the propaganda network, and party organizations specifically lead the reading group activities through propagandists. Third, the reading time is adapted to the farmers' production activities, which enables the reading groups to be consolidated. During the busy farming season, farmers have many production activities and very little free time. Rural areas in Shanxi Province have universally promoted the "field reading" method, implementing "people go to the field, newspapers follow people, and production and reading newspapers are not delayed"; facts have proved that "field reading" is a good form of close integration of reading newspapers and production.

### 山西省读报运动普遍开展

    山西省读报运动普遍开展
    编辑同志：山西省广大城乡中的读报活动已形成群众性的运动。据六月份的不完全统计，全省已有三万八千多个读报组，七十万读报组员，订阅各种报刊三十九万多份（不包括市报），平均每三十个人有一份报纸或刊物。这是解放以后群众的政治觉悟逐步提高，经济生活日益上升，迫切要求文化的结果。平顺县的读报运动就是一个明显的例子。平顺县在解放以前，原是有名的贫瘠地区，一般农民连饭都吃不饱，当然谈不上学习了。解放以后，平顺农民经过土地改革和大生产运动，他们的经济生活改善了，政治兴趣提高了，对文化生活的要求更加迫切了。到今年五月份为止，这个十万人口的县份，已经组织了一千五百零二个读报组，订阅各种报刊四千八百九十七份，参加读报的有五万六千多人。城市中的读报运动发展得更为迅速，太原火车站二百多名职工，全部参加了读报组，订了一百三十七份报纸，平均每三人有两份报。
    开展读报工作，是提高人民政治觉悟，推动各项工作的重要方法。今年春天，黎城县王家庄董桃气农业生产合作社的社员滋长了严重的资本主义思想。很多人认为“要发财就得买地”，这个社的社员大会决定要买三十亩地。群众说：“土地社成了第一家大财主，不用几年就要把全村的地买完了。”以后，这个社成立了读报组，社员们学习了报纸上登载的关于批判农业生产合作社中资本主义思想的文章，立刻恍然大悟，决定不再买地，而用积累的资金实行土地加工，以便提高单位面积产量。
    安邑县姚家庄的农民在读报过程中懂得了组织互助组的好处，全村的互助组很快由十二个增加到二十五个，百分之八十的劳动力都参加了互助合作组织。该村很多农业生产合作社和互助组都学习了植棉丰产模范曲耀离的棉苗密植法，打下了今年棉花丰产的基础。
    山西省的读报工作所以能够形成群众运动，并且取得了一定的成绩，首先是由于各级党委重视这个工作。中共山西省委员会在一九五二年宣传网工作计划中，强调指出：全省所有党的基层组织，都要加强对读报工作的领导；并具体规定全省到一九五二年年底要组织一百五十万到二百万人参加读报组。五月十四日，省委又向各市委、地委发出“关于普遍推广读报通讯工作的通知”。各市委、地委、县委都根据当地具体情况，订出了开展读报工作的计划，并且建立了一系列的辅导、传授、检查等工作制度，保证了读报组的发展和巩固。很多农村、工厂的党支部成立了读报指导委员会和读报传授站，及时总结和交流经验，加强对读报工作的思想领导。第二，是由于读报工作和党的宣传网工作结合起来了。各地党的组织都把时事宣传定为宣传网的经常的主要的内容之一，党的组织通过宣传员具体领导读报组活动。第三，读报时间适应了农民的生产活动，这就使读报组得以巩固起来。在农忙季节，农民生产活动繁多，空闲时间很少，山西省各地农村普遍推广了“地头读报”的办法，实行“人上地，报跟人，生产读报都不误”；事实证明，“地头读报”是读报和生产密切结合的良好形式。
