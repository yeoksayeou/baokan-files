    Cultural Great Advance
    Peng Bin, Sun Hanchun, Made
    I. Zhang Laifu studied in the military region's crash literacy experimental class for a month, learned more than two thousand three hundred characters, and returned to the Fifth Company headquarters with the "Learning Model" award flag.
    II. This news quickly spread throughout the entire company. Some people didn't believe it, and some wanted to hear about his experience. The company commander said, "I also have some doubts about this achievement, but it was taught by the military region, so it can't be fake. Let's first test him in public, and then report his experience to everyone tomorrow." Zhang Laifu took a copy of the novel "Never Fall Behind" from someone, randomly opened a page, and read it clearly. The listeners were all in a trance.
    III. The next day, the Fifth Company held a welcome meeting and invited Comrade Zhang Laifu to introduce his learning experience. Readers, here is his autobiography.

    文化大进军
    彭彬　孙翰春　作
    一、张来福在军区速成识字实验班学习了一个月，认会了两千三百多字，带着“学习模范”的奖旗，回到五连连部。
    二、这个消息马上传遍了整个连队，大家有的不相信，有的想听听经验。连长说：“这个成绩我也有些怀疑，可是军区教的，不会假了，咱们先来当众测验，明天再给大家报告经验。”张来福从别人手里接过一本“永不掉队”的小说来，随便翻开一页，就清清楚楚地念完了。听的人都出了神。
    三、第二天，五连开了个欢迎大会，请张来福同志介绍他的学习经验。读者们，下面就是他的自述。
