Great Subject Matter, Authentic Image
—After Watching the Movie "Generalissimo Suvorov"
Wang Chaowen

Suvorov was a great Russian commander of the 18th century, a brilliant strategist, and a military educator. His personal life and military career were inseparable. For seventy long years, except for his childhood, he lived with soldiers, "Cherishing the motherland, fighting for the glory of the motherland…", and establishing many military achievements for the country. Surikov's famous painting "Suvorov Crossing the Alps" depicts how he led his army from the brink of destruction, penetrated behind enemy lines, and created unprecedented victories. His immortal legacy, represented by the classic military work "The Science of Victory," remains a valuable asset of the eternally invincible Soviet people to this day.

This enlightened commander, who called himself a "soldier," treated his subordinates like a stern but loving father or elder brother, and the soldiers loved him as they would a father. This supreme commander, who had been a squad leader and had always lived among soldiers, was very familiar with the qualities, strengths, and aspirations of his soldiers, and he himself possessed the patriotic spirit, confidence, bravery, agility, purity of heart, and uninhibited characteristics of his soldiers. He was wounded many times, scorned comfortable and gentle living, and disliked the vulgarity of the court. Only the army was the environment he admired. However, Suvorov was ultimately a general who had received excellent education (including literary education), and therefore he was different from the average soldier of the time. According to "Soldier and Commander" (published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, author Pigalev), he was influenced by his respected Peter the Great and the ancient Roman general Caesar, among other famous generals. He synthesized the advantages of his predecessors and mentors, especially battlefield practice, developed the military principles of his predecessors, developed the art of military leadership and command, and formed characteristics such as foresight, decisiveness, and tenacity that were higher than those of soldiers.

Suvorov's noble qualities and character traits are concentrated in his letter to Paul I. This letter is what he defined as a "model of a hero" and is a general summary of his own characteristics. To better understand such a hero, please allow me to transcribe a translated excerpt from the letter:

"The hero I am talking about in this letter is bold but not impatient, quick but not frivolous; active but not superficial; obedient to superiors but not servile, acting as an officer but not being opinionated; victorious but not arrogant; fond of success but not boastful; self-respecting but not conceited; generous but not deceitful; strong but not stubborn; humble but not hypocritical; serious but not pedantic; lively but not frivolous; knowledgeable and without dross; courteous to others but not two-faced; intelligent but not cunning; straightforward but not naive; kind to others but not secretive; serving others without seeking personal gain; decisive in action and without hesitation; cautious in thinking but not showing off wit; opposed to jealousy and private grudges, treating enemies with leniency to subdue them, treating friends with loyalty to earn their love; tireless in physical training; knowing shame and self-restraint; taking religion as a moral code, and the virtues of great men as a model for conduct; sincere in heart, despising hypocrisy; straightforward in mind, opposing insidiousness; only associating with upright gentlemen; reputation and honor are his personal property; deeply loved and trusted by the emperor and soldiers; always weighing things carefully and thinking deeply, whether in battle or on the march, and leaving everything to God's control; never being deceived by temporary opportunities, but striving to control the environment, always acting according to his clearly understood rules." (Excerpt from "Soldier and Commander," published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House).

As a commander, strategist, and military educator, it is no simple task to portray him vividly in a film that lasts nearly two hours. However, the movie "Generalissimo Suvorov," starting from his mature old age, succinctly but also exceptionally vividly and credibly portrays this great figure. Particularly valuable is that, just as Suvorov's military principles are specifically manifested in combat, the film specifically demonstrates his military thinking and other aspects through the depiction of some representative actions and their impact, rather than relying on his own speeches or any abstract explanations. This is not to say that it has a theme and then seeks some dispensable details to embellish it with so-called "visualization"; rather, the screenwriter, director, and actors seriously studied Suvorov's biography and related materials, thoroughly understood his thoughts and personality, and thus created a distinct personality. Therefore, his military thinking and the like can be expressed through actions with distinctive personal characteristics.

Those who have seen this film will not forget the very moving incident of his direct conflict with Tsar Paul. He was summoned to the palace, willing to accept the arduous task of commander in order to protect the safety of the motherland. However, because Paul blindly copied the Prussian military system, using corporal punishment instead of educational principles that inspired soldiers' self-confidence and pride, treating soldiers as lifeless machines and springs, and linking Suvorov's honor with machines and springs, wanting him to command them in battle, this aroused his stern protest:

"It's a machine... it's a spring, that is, a puppet! Whether a puppet holds a war knife or a bayonet, it is still a puppet. Leading such an army, not to mention me, even someone stronger than me cannot win. … I can command living people, not springs."

When that neurotic emperor angrily rebuked him for "nonsense," and argued that "the Prussian Frederick's army has infinite glory," Suvorov did not retreat in the slightest, but mocked:

"Your Majesty, I am Russian, and I do not need to chase Frederick's tail. Only if I defeat him on the battlefield will I chase him!" [Note]

From this excerpted conversation alone, one can appreciate the character traits of Suvorov's pride, composure, calmness, fearlessness, wit, sternness, and humor. As far as the language itself is concerned, it is novel, concise, clear and suggestive, full of irresistible power, and also shows that it is not restricted by court customs, and has the unrestrained characteristics of soldier's language. If this conversation can be considered equivalent to a battle, then these characterful languages not only appropriately describe his bold attack on dogmatic and formalistic military systems, showing his disagreement with Paul, but also show his method of seizing the enemy's vitals and giving sudden attacks when the enemy is least prepared to defeat the enemy. Only by portraying Suvorov's character so vividly and realistically can his unique insights be more distinct.

This film, with its authentic image, can almost be said to be able to bring the audience into the film from beginning to end, rarely making people aware that they are appreciating a foreign story from more than a hundred years ago. For example: Suvorov's rewards for meritorious officers and soldiers, his reprimands and punishments for those who are derelict in their duties; his concern for the health of messengers (gifting clothes); his leniency towards French prisoners (returning swords); his keen sense that Austria has already betrayed; his vigilance against the serious consequences that will arise after Austria's betrayal; assigning Duke Bagration arduous combat tasks without hindering creative tactical deployments; in the emergency of being surrounded in the Alps, decisively deciding to break out of danger; disregarding unnecessary formalities, using officer belts to tie wooden bridges; taking the lead in charging in extremely dangerous situations; … These many plots not only embody the principles of his "Science of Victory" and the proposition of "Heroic Model," but also these plots that realistically depict the characters are very moving.

In this movie, Suvorov's character is depicted very vividly. When he appears in front of the audience for the first time amidst the expectations of the soldiers, this white-haired but energetic general gives a strong impression. When he handles different problems in different situations, his language and actions can be used as concrete explanations of the virtues mentioned in the "Heroic Model." And the humor and satire that are not advocated in the "Heroic Model" are prominently shown as one aspect of his character. And these humorous and satirical depictions are accurate and appropriate.

Soviet scholar Roshal briefly mentioned in "Historical Biographical Films" (published in the "On Soviet Films" by the Era Publishing House) that the filming of the movie "Generalissimo Suvorov" encountered several major difficulties. People have great interest in Suvorov's special quirks – his biographers and even his contemporaries often fabricated such quirks, and thus it is easy to make the image of this great figure become grotesque. And the image of this great figure created in the movie did not allow the greatness of his personality to be diluted and obscured by these quirks.

This is certainly not to say that only a solemn or even rigid image can be used to describe this giant with a special character, nor is it to say that one can arbitrarily abandon his sense of humor and his talent for satire. Rather, it is to say that any humorous and satirical depictions must be such that they do not harm Suvorov's greatness, but rather are conducive to depicting his greatness.

In the movie, the fact is that whether he is joking and teasing his young soldiers, whether he is satirizing the treacherous officials in the court who are promoted quickly, whether he is pretending to have a stomach ache in front of Emperor Paul, or even talking to an old dog, it is all related to his great personality. Even saying that he wants to become a monk is not to show off cheap tastes to make the audience laugh. On the contrary, this is to portray the hero's pain, symbolizing that his talent is not valued and cannot be brought into play.

An easily amusing detail is his disrespectful action of bowing deeply to the attendant. When someone tells him that this is just an attendant, he gives a meaningful explanation of his actions:

"I know, dear, I know. That's why I bow to him. Today he is an attendant, tomorrow he will be a baron!"

This perfectly shows this hero who has contributed to the country but is envied by the emperor, and the contempt and hatred for those "red leather soles under the feet, often better than the brains on the head" (Suvorov's words, recorded from "Soldier and Commander") and who have gained status in the court by deceit. This is not light laughter, but a sharp method used against clowns. When film artists depict Suvorov's use of satire, even if they use imagination and exaggeration, they do not ignore his own essential characteristics – distinguishing right from wrong and grasping the main objects that should be satirized.

Suvorov's satirical talent is mainly expressed in language in the film. For example, after he quickly solved the battle on the outskirts of Warsaw by marching rapidly through the forest, the friendly forces were still slowly marching in the middle of the road. Suvorov publicly ridiculed the messenger of the friendly forces who did not treat the battlefield as a battlefield, but as the Katin training ground for mechanical observance of marching regulations.

"Hey! But who are we fighting with? Ah, the Polish positions are gone... you see for yourself, are they there? No?

"Could it be our mistake? We didn't wait for you, we defeated the enemy.

"What should we do, God! Should we retreat and attack this position again with your generals?..."

These meaningful satirical words spoken with a serious attitude are also an indirect description of Suvorov's character of starting from reality and flexibly solving specific problems.

Suvorov's character traits are of course not only expressed in satirical and humorous conversations; his appearance – posture and all details – has an important role in showing his character. In order to portray this figure completely rather than fragmentarily, all scenes, actions, and languages are interconnected and cannot be separated. However, the linguistic forms that are interconnected with his appearance, whether it is tone, rhythm, intonation, timbre, or sentence structure, are all related to character description. One of the prominent features of this film is the ability to grasp Suvorov's own powerful language structure, like a swift wind and a rushing stream. These language structures all have jumping characteristics. For example, when he clashes with Paul, is expelled from the palace, and calmly and excitedly shouts slogans to his beloved soldiers: "Izmail, glory! Warsaw, glory! Poltava, glory! Glory!" These jumping short sentences give the impression of bullets bursting out. As introduced in the book "Soldier and Commander," Suvorov's diverse language does not have the shortcoming of being loose and scattered; this is related to his lively character (even if some sentences are grammatically incorrect, it is only because his pen cannot keep up with his rapidly advancing thoughts).

Suvorov's character is not only directly expressed through his conversations and actions. In other respects, how the enemy hates and fears him, and how the masses love him, in terms of its objective impact, those plots also have the significance of his character description. For example, the story of how the veteran Braton tells the peasants about the conquest of the Izmail fortress is also an indirect description of Suvorov. Although Braton deifies Suvorov, these narratives, including parts of myths, reveal the essence of the great marshal.

"He can even see through the city walls," "He only glared at the enemy, and they fell down and died of fright."

These statements seem absurd, but they are consistent with Suvorov's characteristics. Seriously understanding the specific situation, thinking deeply, and thus cultivating insight and foresight, not fearing any difficulties and dangers, and thus forming the power to subdue the enemy, are precisely aspects of Suvorov's characteristics.

Whether it is Suvorov's character, his military thinking, combat art, or military education policies, they have all been concretely and credibly described and stated in this film. Although the film artists did not preach with a straight face, the audience, while appreciating the images of Suvorov and other characters, gained lessons on how to and how not to fight, be a person, and learn. Because the image is real and vivid, and because being moved is more important than knowing, this kind of education is also more profound. If the film artists did not creatively describe the special attachment of his soldiers when Suvorov was forced to retire (this is a very moving scene), then the relationship between superiors and subordinates in Suvorov's army could not be realistically shown, the audience could not be emotionally connected with the characters in the play, and it would not be more convincing than Suvorov's leadership theory that "kindness must exceed strictness..." and so on.

Suvorov, who accumulated combat knowledge that surpassed his predecessors through forty years of war and thus wrote the immortal "Science of Victory," inevitably revealed the character of a soldier and commander in various actions, which is easy to understand. The problem is: we are not facing Suvorov himself, but watching a movie. To be able to make the audience not feel that the actors are acting when watching a movie, not listening to a disguised military lecture, but making us seem to see the living Suvorov, we can only rely on the serious and diligent work of the artists.

In order to realistically portray the character of this great figure, the film artists not only familiarized themselves with the materials, but also fully studied the materials. They also fully studied the relationship between his language, gestures, and appearance. Pudovkin, the director of this film, mentioned the creation of this film in his paper "Stanislavsky's System in Film" ("Film Art Reference Materials" No. 3) and made an original discussion. He not only studied the characteristics of Suvorov's language itself, but also through its unique linguistic form, more comprehensively and deeply understood his character, and fully used his imagination on this realistic basis, thus creating a soulful and expressive appearance. He believes that Suvorov's own language, such as "Choose a heroic model for yourself! Follow him! Chase after him! Overtake him! Glory belongs to you!" is inseparable from his vivid and powerful posture, and it can be clearly felt that the distance between his thoughts, feelings and actions is very short. … From this it can be seen that the success of this film is inseparable from the diligent work of talented and serious artists. The fact is: only when the image first lives in the artist's imagination, can it then live in the eyes and hearts of the film audience. Like excellent films such as "Chapayev," this "Generalissimo Suvorov" allows the audience to see living historical figures, and thus the audience thanks the hard-working film artists.

"Generalissimo Suvorov" is an interesting and beneficial Chinese-translated film, and it is a loss in learning if you have not seen this movie.

[Note] According to Grigoriev's narrative (see "Alexander Suvorov" published by Jiaodong Xinhua Bookstore), in the Seven Years' War, the Prussian King Frederick was defeated by the Russian army. Suvorov served as the chief of staff of the main attacking force. As described in the prologue of the script "Marshal Suvorov" (published by Shanghai Magazine Company), he and the Russian army once stormed Berlin. This satirical line in the movie contains a factual basis for despising Frederick.

    伟大的题材、真实的形象
    ——电影“苏沃洛夫大元帅”观后
    王朝闻
    苏沃洛夫是俄国十八世纪伟大的统帅，天才的战略家，军事教育家。他个人的生活和军事生涯分不开，七十岁的悠长岁月，除了儿童时期以外，就一直和士兵生活在一起，“爱护祖国，为了祖国的光荣而战……”，给祖国建立了许多战功。苏里柯夫的名画“苏沃洛夫横越阿尔卑斯山”，就是描写他如何把军队从毁灭的边沿带出来，插入敌军的背后，创造了史无前例的战绩的。他的不朽的遗教，以经典性的军事著作“致胜科学”为代表，直到今天，仍然是永远不可战胜的苏联人民的宝贵遗产。
    自称为“士兵”的这一英明的指挥员，他待下级如严厉而慈爱的父亲或兄长，士兵们也像对待父亲一样的爱他。当过十长，一直生活在士兵之中的这一位最高统帅，非常熟悉士兵的品质、特长和志愿，而且自己也具备着他的士兵那种热爱祖国、自信、骁勇、敏捷、心地纯洁以及无羁的特点。他多次受伤，鄙弃舒适和温存的生活，看不惯朝廷的俗气，只有军队是他所爱慕的环境。然而苏沃洛夫究竟是一个受过优异教养（包括文艺的教养）的将军，因而他又不同于当时一般士兵。照“兵士兼统帅”（莫斯科外国文书籍出版局出版，作者皮加列夫）所介绍，他受他所尊敬的彼得大帝以及古罗马的凯撒大将等等名将的影响，他综合了前辈和导师的优点，特别是战场的实践，发展了前辈的军事学原理，发展了军事领导和指挥的艺术，形成比士兵更高的预见、果断、坚韧……诸特征。
    苏沃洛夫的高贵品质和性格的特征，集中地表现在给保罗一世的信上。这封信是他所规定的“英雄的典范”，也是概括地说明了他自己的特点。为了便于了解这样一位英雄，请读者容许我抄录该信的一段译文。
    “我在这封信里所说的英雄，是胆大而不急躁，迅速而不轻佻；爱动而不粗浮；服从上司而不卑躬屈节，身为长官而不刚愎自用；胜而不骄；喜功而不自炫；自重而不自傲；豪爽而不欺人；刚强而不执拗；谦虚而不装假；认真而不迂腐；活泼而不轻浮；学识完备而无糟粕成分；对人客气而不口蜜腹剑；明达而不狡黠；直爽而不幼稚；待人和霭而不隐讳；为人效劳而不贪图私利；作事坚决而毫不犹豫；谨慎思索而不卖弄机智；反对嫉妒心理，反对私仇观念，宽仁待敌而使敌慑服，忠信待友而使友爱戴；为锻炼身体而劬劳不倦；知耻而自制；以宗教为道德法典，以伟人德行为立身模范；诚恳为怀，鄙弃虚伪；存心直爽，反对阴险；只和正人君子来往；名誉廉耻是其个人财产；深获皇上和士卒爱护，备受信任；无论会战时或行军时，万事再三权衡，深思熟虑，而全听上帝支配；决不为一时机会所惑，而力求支配环境，始终均按其洞瞩无遗规则动作。”（摘自莫斯科外国文书籍出版局出版的“兵士兼统帅”）作为一个统帅、战略家、军事教育家，要在放映近两小时的电影里，形象地表现出来，不是简单的工作。然而电影“苏沃洛夫大元帅”，从他成熟的老年开始，扼要地同时又是异常鲜明而真实可信地刻画了这一伟大的人物。特别可贵的是：如同苏沃洛夫的军事原理具体表现在作战中一样，电影是从一些具有代表意义的行动及其影响的描写，具体地表现了他的军事思想及其他，而不是依靠他本人的演说以及任何抽象的说明。这不是说，它是有了主题，从而寻求一些可有可无的枝节，妄加粉饰的所谓“形象化”；而是编剧、导演、演员认真研究苏沃洛夫的传记及有关的材料，透彻地了解了他的思想和人格，从而创造了个性鲜明的形象，因而其军事思想之类能够通过具有个性特征的行动表现出来。
    看过这一影片的人，不会忘记他和沙皇保罗正面冲突这一场十分动人的事件。他应召进宫，为了保卫祖国安全，愿意接受艰巨的统帅任务。然而，由于保罗盲目抄袭普鲁士军事制度，用军棍代替启发士兵们的自信心和自豪心的教育原理，用无生命的机械、弹簧来看待士兵，而且把苏沃洛夫的荣誉和机械、弹簧联系在一起，要他指挥他们作战，因而引起他的严正抗议：
    “是机械……是弹簧，也就是木偶了！木偶手里不论拿着战刀，或枪刺，反正还是个木偶。率领这样的军队，不用说是我，就是比我强的，也打不了胜仗。……我能指挥活人，而不是弹簧。”
    当那一位神经质的皇上暴怒地斥责他“胡说”，而且强辩地认为“普鲁士腓特力的军队有着无限光荣”时，苏沃洛夫毫不退却地嘲笑道：
    “启奏陛下，我是俄国人，我无需乎赶腓特力的尾巴。若是在战场上交锋打垮了他，才赶呢！”〔注〕
    仅仅从这点摘引的谈话里，也可以体会到苏沃洛夫那种自豪、从容、镇静、无畏、机敏、严峻、幽默的性格特征。就语言本身而论，它新颖、简练、明了而富于暗示性，充满不可抵抗的力量，也显示着不被宫庭习气所拘束，具有士兵语言那种放荡不羁的特色。如果可以认为这一场谈话也相同于一场战斗，那么，这一些性格化的语言，不仅恰如其分地描写了他果敢地向教条主义、形式主义的军事制度进攻，显示着他和保罗意见的分歧，也表现了他抓住敌人要害，在敌人最少防备时给予突然袭击的制胜敌人的方法。也只有这样把苏沃洛夫的性格刻画得十分生动和真实，他的特殊的见解才能够更显得分明。
    形象真实的这一部片子，几乎可以说，从头到尾都能够把观众带进电影里去，很少使人意识着自己在欣赏一百多年以前的外国故事。比如说：苏沃洛夫对待立功的军官和士兵的奖励，对待失职者的斥责和惩罚；对信使健康的关心（赠衣）；对法国俘虏的宽大（退剑）；敏锐地感到奥国已经叛变；警惕奥国叛变后将要产生的严重后果；给公爵巴格拉奇昂规定艰巨的战斗任务，不作妨碍创造性的战术部署；在阿尔卑斯山上被包围的紧急情况中，断然决定冲出险境；不顾无谓的仪表，用军官皮带束木架桥；在十分危险的情况下带头冲锋；……这许多情节，不仅都体现着他的“致胜科学”的原理和“英雄典范”的主张，而且这些真实地描写了人物的情节，都是很动人的。
    这一部电影里，苏沃洛夫的性格是描写得很鲜明的。当他在士兵群众期待中出场，第一次与电影观众见面，这个头发全白然而精力充沛的将军，就给人一个强烈的印象。当他在不同情况下处理不同的问题的时候，其语言、行动，都可以作为“英雄典范”中所提到的那些优点的具体解释。而“英雄典范”中没有提倡的幽默和讽刺，却是很突出地被表现为他的性格之一面。而这些幽默和讽刺的描写，确切，恰到好处。
    苏联罗沙里在“历史传记片”（刊在时代出版社出版的“论苏联电影”）一文中简略地提到：电影“苏沃洛夫大元帅”的排演过程中曾经遇到若干重大的困难。人们对苏沃洛夫的特殊的怪癖发生很大的兴趣——他的传记家们甚至当代的人们还常常杜撰着这种怪癖，因而很容易使这一位伟大的人物的形象流于怪诞。而电影中所创造的这一位伟大人物的形象，却没有使其个性的伟大之点被这些怪癖所冲淡和蒙蔽。
    这当然不是说，只能用庄严甚至呆板的形象来描写这一具有特殊性格的巨人，不是说可以任意舍弃他那幽默感和惯于讽刺的才能。而是说，任何幽默和讽刺的描写，必须是这样：不损害苏沃洛夫的伟大，而是为了有利于描写他的伟大。
    在电影里，事实是这样：不论是和他的青年战士说笑话逗嘴，不论是讽刺升官很快的朝中奸党，不论是在皇帝保罗面前装肚子疼，甚至于向老狗说话，都和他那伟大的人格有关。即令是说自己要去做和尚，也不是为引起观众发笑而卖弄廉价的趣味。正相反，这是为了刻画英雄的痛苦，象征其才能不被重视和无从发挥。
    很容易引人发笑的一个细节，是他向御侍深深行一个鞠躬礼的不庄重的行动。当别人告诉他这不过是一个御侍时，他对自己的行动作了意味深长的说明：
    “知道，亲爱的，知道。所以才给他行礼。今天是御侍下人，明天就是男爵！”
    这就正好表现了这一位对国家有功而被皇帝嫉视的英雄，对宫庭中那些“脚下的红皮鞋底，往往胜过头上的脑筋”（苏沃洛夫语，录自“兵士兼统帅”）、骗取地位的显官们的鄙视和憎恨的具体表现。这不是轻松的嘲笑，而是对丑角们所使用的一种尖锐的方式。电影艺术家在描写苏沃洛夫施用讽刺的时候，即使运用着想像、夸张，也不忽视他本人的本质特征——是非分明，抓住应该讽刺的主要对象。
    苏沃洛夫的讽刺才能，在电影中主要是用语言来表现的。举例来说，当他用急行军穿过森林，迅速解决了华沙外围的战斗之后，友军却还缓慢地在中途行军。对于这支不把战场当战场，而把战场当做卡秦练兵场的机械遵守行军规程的友军，苏沃洛夫向该友军的信使公开嘲笑。
    “嘿！可是到底跟谁交战呢？是啊，波兰阵地已经没有了……你自己看，有么？那有哇？
    “难道是我们的错误？没等你们，我们把敌人打垮了。
    “这可怎么办呢，上帝啊！我们是不是该退却，再和你们的将军，重新攻打这阵地呢？……”
    这些用正经态度说出来的意味深长的讽刺话，同时也就是苏沃洛夫从实际出发、灵活地解决具体问题的性格的间接描写。
    苏沃洛夫的性格特征，当然不只表现在讽刺和幽默的谈话上；他的外形——姿态及一切细节，都具有显示性格的重要作用。为了完整地而不是破碎地刻画这一人物，一切场面、动作、语言都是互相连贯着，不容割裂的。但是与他的外形互相连贯的语言形式，不论是语气、节奏、声调、音色和字句结构，都和性格描写有关。这部片子的显著特点之一，是把握得住苏沃洛夫本人那种急风、奔流一样有力的语言结构。这些语言结构，都有跳动的特色。举例来说，当他和保罗冲突，被逐出宫，向爱他的士兵们从容地激动地叫的口号：“伊兹美尔，光荣！华沙，光荣！波尔塔瓦，光荣！光荣呵！”这一些跳动的短句，给人一种枪弹迸发的印象。正如“兵士兼统帅”一书所介绍，苏沃洛夫多采的语言，没有松懈散漫的缺点；这和他那生龙活虎一样的性格有关（即令某些文句不合文法，不过由于他的笔跟不上迅速前进的思绪）。”
    苏沃洛夫的性格，不仅是直接从他的谈话和行动描写来表现。其他，敌人如何恨他怕他，群众如何爱戴他，就其客观影响看来，那些情节也就具有他的性格描写的意义。例如老兵布拉唐向农民讲述如何攻克伊兹美尔要塞的故事，也就是对苏沃洛夫的间接描写。虽然布拉唐把苏沃洛夫神化了，这些包括着部分神话的讲述中，却揭示着伟大的元帅的本质。
    “就连城墙也看得透”，“他只一瞪眼，敌人就倒了，吓死了”。
    这些说法似乎是很无稽的，但它和苏沃洛夫的特征吻合。认真了解具体情况，深思熟虑，因而培养起来的洞察力和预见，不怕任何困难与危险，因而形成慑服敌人的威力，正是苏沃洛夫特征的一个方面。
    不论是苏沃洛夫的性格，不论是他的军事思想、战斗艺术、军事教育方针，在这一部片子中都得到了具体的真实可信的描写和申述。电影艺术家虽然没有板着面孔说教，观众在欣赏苏沃洛夫和其他人物的形象时，获得了应该如何与不应该如何战斗、为人、学习的教益。由于形象的真实和生动，由于感动重于知道，这种教益也就更深刻。假如说，电影艺术家不是独创地描写苏沃洛夫被迫退休时他的士兵那种特殊的依恋（这是十分动人的一场），那就不能真实地表现苏沃洛夫部队的上下级关系，不能使观众与剧中人的感情联系在一起，也不会比苏沃洛夫“慈爱要超过严格……”等等领导理论更有说服力。
    从四十年烽火考验中积累了超越前辈的战斗知识因而写成了不朽的“致胜科学”的苏沃洛夫，他必然在各种行动中流露出作为一个兵士兼统帅的品行，这是很容易理解的。问题在于：我们并非面对苏沃洛夫本人，而是在看电影。要能够使观众在看电影时不感觉演员在演戏，不是在听化装的军事学讲演，而是让我们似乎看到活的苏沃洛夫，那就只有依靠艺术家认真的辛勤的劳动。
    为了真实地刻画这一伟大人物的性格，电影艺术家不仅熟悉材料，而且充分研究过材料。也充分研究了他的语言和姿态、外形的关系。这部片子的导演普多夫金，在他的论文“电影中的史坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系”（“电影艺术参考资料”第三号）中，提到这一电影的创作问题，并作了独创性的论述。他不仅研究了苏沃洛夫语言本身的特征，而且通过其独特的语言形式，更全面更深刻地认识了他的性格，在这一现实基础上充分运用想像，从而创造了有灵魂的表情丰富的外形。他认为，苏沃洛夫本人的语言，例如“给自己选择一个英雄模范吧！跟随着他！追上他！赶过他！光荣是属于你的！”和他生动有力的姿式分不开，可以明显地感到，他的思想、感情与行为间的距离很短。……由此可见：这部片子的成功，和有才能而且认真的艺术家的辛勤劳动分不开。事实是：只有形象首先活在艺术家的想像里，然后才能够活在电影观众的眼里和心里。如同“夏伯阳”等等优秀的电影，这部“苏沃洛夫大元帅”让观众看到活的历史人物，因而观众感谢辛勤劳动的电影艺术家。
    “苏沃洛夫大元帅”是一部有趣而有益的中译电影片，如果没有看这部电影，是一种学习上的损失。
    〔注〕据格黎高里也夫的叙述（见胶东新华书店出版的“亚力山大·苏沃洛夫”），在七年战争中，普鲁士王腓特力大败于俄军。苏沃洛夫担任主攻部队的参谋长。如同剧本“苏沃洛夫元帅”（上海杂志公司出版）序幕中所描写，他和俄军曾经直捣柏林。电影中这一句讽刺性的台词，包含着鄙视腓特力的事实根据。
