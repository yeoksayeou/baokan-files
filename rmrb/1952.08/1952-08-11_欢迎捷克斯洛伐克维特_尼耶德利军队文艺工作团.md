    Welcome to the Czechoslovak Vit Nejedlý Army Art Troupe
    Chen Yi
    I am very honored to represent the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in extending a warm welcome to the Czechoslovak Vit Nejedlý Army Art Troupe, which has come from afar to visit and perform for the people and army of our country.
    Although China and Czechoslovakia are geographically far apart, we are so close and linked together because of our common ideals, because of our heroic cause of guarding the peaceful outposts of Eastern Europe and the Far East, respectively, on the peace and democracy front led by the Soviet Union. Undoubtedly, your arrival will further consolidate and develop the friendship between the people and armies of China and Czechoslovakia.
    As envoys of the glorious Czechoslovak army, the Vit Nejedlý Army Art Troupe has gloriously completed the cause of inspiring and educating troops in artistic form in the past years of cruel war and in the current peaceful construction. Therefore, the meeting of our two countries' army art troupes will gain extensive learning and influence in each other's traditional spirit, traditional style, and in the cause of serving the military through each other's culture and art. We know that each other's achievements and their mutual influence will be conducive to the cause of defending people's democracy and world peace.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people and their armed forces, who grew up in arduous battles, love the people of Czechoslovakia and their brilliant national art very much. In the past and now, many Czechoslovak poems and songs have been incorporated into our struggles and lives, especially Julius Fučík's "Report from the Gallows," an incomparably heroic and optimistic poem, which has had a tremendous impact on the people and army of our country.
    Today we welcome you with incomparable sincerity, not as distant guests, but as comrades-in-arms and comrades.
    I firmly believe that the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia will be enhanced by your arrival.
    Long live President Gottwald, the leader of the working people of Czechoslovakia!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live Marshal Stalin, the great teacher of the working people of the world!

    欢迎捷克斯洛伐克维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团
    陈沂
    我十分荣幸地代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部对远道而来向我国人民和军队访问并表演的捷克斯洛伐克维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团致热烈的欢迎。
    中捷两国在地理上虽然距离得十分遥远，但是由于我们共同的理想，由于我们在以苏联为首的和平民主阵线上分别守卫了东欧和远东的和平前哨阵地的英雄事业，使我们两个国家变得如此亲近，而联结在一起了。无疑的，你们的到来，将使中捷两国人民和军队之间的友谊获得更进一步的巩固和发展。
    作为光辉的捷克斯洛伐克军队使节的维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团在过去残酷的战争年代里，在目前和平建设中，都曾光荣地完成了以艺术形式鼓舞和教育部队的事业。因此，我们两国军队文艺团体的相会，在彼此的传统精神、传统作风和在彼此的文化艺术为兵服务这一事业上将获得广泛的学习和影响，我们知道，彼此的每一种成就及其相互的影响，都会有利于保卫人民民主和世界和平的事业。
    在中国共产党的领导下，在艰苦的战斗中成长起来的中国人民和他们的武装部队是十分喜爱捷克斯洛伐克的人民和他们灿烂的民族艺术的，过去和现在有不少捷克斯洛伐克的诗歌和歌曲都加入了我们的战斗和生活，特别是尤利斯·伏契克的“绞索套着脖子时的报告”这一本无比英勇无比乐观的诗篇，在我国人民及军队间，产生了极其巨大的影响。
    今天我们以无比的挚诚来欢迎你们，我们不是把你们作为远客来欢迎，而是作为战友，作为同志来欢迎的。
    我深信中捷两国人民兄弟般的友谊，将因你们的到来而日益增进。
    捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的领袖哥特瓦尔德总统万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    全世界劳动人民伟大的导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
