The policy of expanding armies and preparing for war is seriously damaging the economies of Western European countries. Recently, the British and French governments, facing increasingly deteriorating economies and teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, have had to sound the "alarm," announcing their intention to delay their military expansion steps in order to avoid economic collapse. This undermines the US plan to force the so-called NATO countries to provide fifty divisions of invading troops and four thousand aircraft by the end of this year; this is a serious blow to the US war policy in Western Europe.

The ailments of Britain, France, and other Western European countries are all the same. As Stalin pointed out a year and a half ago: "Increasing armies and engaging in expanding armaments will expand military industry, reduce civilian industry, halt huge civil construction projects, increase taxes, and raise consumer goods prices." Thus, an economic crisis is formed that becomes more serious day by day.

As a result of implementing the US policy of expanding armies and preparing for war, the military budgets of Britain and France have been increasing year by year. In the fiscal year 1952-53, Britain's direct military expenditure is approximately 1.5 billion pounds, accounting for more than 35 percent of the total budget. If other expenses related to military expansion and war preparations are added, the figure is much higher. France's military expenditure reaches 1.27 trillion francs, accounting for 40 percent of the total budget. In order to maintain budget balance, the British government and the French government, to make up for the huge budget deficit (800 billion francs in 1951 and expected to reach 1.5 trillion francs in 1952), can only desperately increase taxes and issue excessive currency. In the fiscal year 1952-53, the total tax revenue in Britain is more than 4.7 billion pounds, plundering an average of 40 percent of each Briton's income. The French government is increasing taxes by another 150 billion francs this year on top of already high taxes, and is also using the method of issuing "bonds" to plunder the people. In addition to bearing heavy taxes, the people of Britain and France also suffer from the disasters of inflation and rising prices. Last year, the amount of currency in circulation in Britain increased more than threefold compared to pre-war levels; the amount of francs issued is nearly 2 trillion, and the amount in circulation is twenty times that of pre-war levels. The purchasing power of currency continues to decline. Last year, one pound was only worth 26 percent of its 1945 value. The value of the franc has plummeted even more rapidly, with one US dollar worth more than 400 francs on the black market (the official French price is 300 francs per US dollar). Prices in Britain have increased more than twofold compared to pre-war levels, while in France they have increased twenty-six-fold. The cost of living continues to rise, and people's lives are deteriorating.

Due to the abnormal development of the armaments industry and the low purchasing power of the people, the number of bankruptcies and closures of civilian factories is increasing day by day. In Lancashire, the center of the British textile industry, one-third of the 1,500 textile factories are either closed or only partially open. British arms production continues to increase, but the rate of increase in total industrial production has clearly declined, indicating that British civilian industry has shrunk to an alarming extent. In France, more than 6,300 industrial and commercial enterprises were registered as bankrupt or closed last year. The inevitable result of the reduction of civilian industry is a sharp increase in the number of unemployed. The number of unemployed workers in Britain has reached more than 600,000. In France, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed exceeds three million.

The severity of the economic crisis in Britain and France is manifested in the depletion of dollar and gold reserves and the sharp decline in currency credit. Due to the stepped-up expansion of armaments, a large amount of military supplies need to be imported, while exports cannot be increased due to a lack of raw materials and markets. This has created a huge trade deficit, with expenditures far exceeding income. Britain's trade deficit in 1951 exceeded 1.2 billion pounds, more than three times that of the previous year. In the first half of this year, although the British government repeatedly reduced imports, the deficit still reached 470 million pounds. France's import surplus in 1951 totaled 1.058 billion US dollars, almost five times that of 1950. The amount of import surplus is still increasing sharply this year. In this case, the British and French governments have no choice but to use the dollar and gold in the national treasury to make up for this difference, resulting in huge losses in reserves. In the first quarter of this year, Britain's gold and dollar reserves decreased by 636 million US dollars, leaving only 1.7 billion US dollars in reserves. In the second quarter, although the depletion of gold and dollars slowed down slightly compared to the past due to receiving 202 million US dollars from the United States and further reducing imports, the reserves have not yet reached the "minimum safe level" of 2 billion US dollars. The situation in France is even more tragic. By April of this year, France's gold and dollar reserves had fallen to about 500 million US dollars, less than 14 percent of pre-war levels. Under the dual impact of dollar shortages and inflation, the credit of the franc has plummeted, becoming the most unstable currency in Europe.

In this situation, the governments of Britain and France do not stop the arms race, but attempt to avoid collapse by intensifying the plunder of the people, which is tantamount to drinking poison to quench thirst. The British Labor government has already forced the British people to endure five years of austerity after the war, and after Churchill came to power, he has repeatedly announced "savings plans," repeatedly reducing imports of food and daily necessities, and reducing spending on social welfare programs. However, this starvation policy of harming the people has not only failed to improve the economic situation, but has worsened it. In recent months, due to a lack of raw materials, British exports have been decreasing day by day (the total value of exports in the second quarter decreased by 13 percent compared to the first quarter), dollar and gold reserves have continued to be depleted, domestic prices have risen sharply (the cost of living has increased by an average of 6 percent in the first half of the year), and the number of unemployed has increased sharply (according to a survey by the British Ministry of Labor, the number in April increased by 50,000 compared to March). Therefore, Churchill exclaimed in June of this year: "The severity of the economic crisis is no less than the bombing of London during the war." Recently, the British government announced further so-called "emergency measures" to reduce imports and increase exports, which is in fact still a policy of making the people tighten their belts even further. It will not only fail to save the British economic crisis, but will instead lead to even more serious economic and political consequences. Because reducing imports on the one hand means continuing to reduce the already meager food and daily necessities of the British people, causing prices to continue to rise and inflation to worsen further; on the other hand, the reduction in imports of raw materials will make the production of civilian industries even more sluggish. As for the export of finished products, it is impossible to find a market due to the import restrictions of various capitalist countries and Britain's compliance with the US policy of trade discrimination against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Therefore, Britain's hope to balance its international payments is impossible to achieve. Former British Labor government trade minister Wilson also pointed out: "Panic-stricken measures, cutting imports, and other such methods cannot solve the problem. ... Unless the economic relations between the United States and the rest of the world change, the continuous crisis threatening Britain cannot be eliminated. If the burden of armaments is not truly and greatly reduced, then we will be powerless in the face of this crisis."

The situation in France is also the same. As early as the end of last year, in order to save the economic crisis on the verge of bankruptcy, the French government also adopted a so-called "savings plan," drastically reducing the import of dollar goods. In February of this year, it expanded import restrictions and reduced civil expenditures, but it still failed to prevent the further deterioration of the dollar crisis. By the end of June, France owed the European Payments Union 420 million US dollars. The French government had placed its hopes on US "aid," but its recent request for arms orders from the United States was rejected, so it was panic-stricken and said it would take "more severe measures" to avoid economic collapse. This so-called "more severe measure" is not to drastically reduce the production of armaments, but to further reduce government civilian expenditures and reduce social insurance and construction costs. This can only create more disasters for the French people.

This "guns instead of butter" policy of the British and French governments is bound to be met with increasingly resolute opposition from the people. The living standards of the people of Britain and France have fallen to extremely low levels. The cost of living in Britain has increased by more than 25 percent in the past year, and the real wages of French workers are less than half of what they were before the war. The further impoverishment of the vast working people is bound to intensify domestic class contradictions, which will encourage more and more people to actively participate in the struggle for bread and peace. Nine million workers in Britain have recently made demands for wage increases in response to the government's starvation policy, and French trade unions have also announced that they will demand wage increases next month. The struggle of the people of Britain and France against hunger and poverty will expand with the deepening of the economic crisis in the two countries, which will not only become a major obstacle to the US imperialist policy of expanding armies and preparing for war, but will also turn the economic crisis in Britain and France into a serious political crisis.

### 日益严重的英法备战经济危机

    日益严重的英法备战经济危机
    扩军备战政策严重地损害着西欧各国的经济。最近英国和法国政府由于两国经济日益恶化而濒临于破产的边缘，不得不发出“警报”，宣布准备延缓扩军步骤，以图避免经济的崩溃。这使美国迫使所谓北大西洋公约国家于今年年底以前提供五十个师侵略部队和四千架飞机的计划趋于破产；这对美国在西欧推行的战争政策是一个严重的打击。
    英法及其他西欧国家的病症都是一样的。这就是斯大林在一年半以前所指出的：“增加军队和从事扩张军备，就使得军事工业扩大，民用工业减缩，使巨大的民用建设工程停顿，赋税增加，消费品价格上涨。”因而形成一天比一天严重的经济危机。
    执行美国扩军备战政策的结果，英国和法国的军事预算年年在增加。一九五二——五三年度，英国的直接军费约十五亿英镑，占全部预算百分之三十五以上，如果再加上其他与扩军备战有关的费用，则还远不止此数。法国则达一万二千七百亿法郎，占了全部预算的百分之四十。英国政府为了保持预算的平衡，法国政府为了弥补庞大的预算赤字（一九五一年共八千亿法郎，一九五二年将要达到一万五千亿法郎），只能拚命增加捐税和滥发货币。一九五二—五三年度英国全年的税收总额为四十七亿余英镑，平均掠夺每个英国人收入的百分之四十。法国政府今年在很高的税额上再增税一千五百亿法郎，另外还用发行“公债”的方法搜括人民。英法两国的人民除了负担沉重的捐税，还要遭受通货膨胀和物价上涨的灾难。英国去年货币流通量已较战前增加了三倍以上；法郎发行额将近二万亿，流通量为战前的二十倍。货币的购买力不断下降，去年一英镑只合一九四五年的百分之二十六。法郎的价值更是急剧跌落，黑市一美元值到四百多法郎（法国官价为一美元值三百法郎）。英国的物价比战前增高了两倍以上，法国则达到二十六倍。生活费用不断上升，人民生活日益恶化。
    由于军火工业的畸形发展和人民购买力的低落，民用工厂破产和倒闭的日益增多。英国纺织业中心兰开厦一千五百家纺织厂，有三分之一不是关门就是只能部分开工。英国军火生产不断增加，但工业总生产的增加率却明显地下降，这表明英国民用工业已缩减到惊人的程度。在法国，去年登记破产和停业的工商业有六千三百多家。民用工业缩减的必然结果是失业人数激增。英国失业工人的数目达六十万以上。法国失业与半失业人数则超过了三百万。
    英法两国经济危机的严重性，表现在美元黄金储备的枯竭和货币信用的暴跌上。由于加紧扩张军备，需要输入大量的军事物资，而出口又因缺乏原料和市场而无法增加，因此造成贸易的巨大逆差，支出远远超过收入。英国一九五一年贸易赤字超过十二亿英镑，等于前一年的三倍多。今年上半年，虽然英国政府一再削减进口，但是赤字还达四亿七千万英镑。法国一九五一年入超总数为十亿五千八百万美元，差不多为一九五○年的五倍。今年入超数额依然在继续激增。在这种情况下，英法两国政府只好拿国库的美元黄金来弥补这个差额，结果便造成储备的巨大亏损。英国今年第一季的黄金美元存底就减少了六亿三千六百万美元，使储备仅剩下十七亿美元。第二季因为从美国得到二亿二百万美元和进一步减少进口，黄金美元的损耗虽比过去略为减缓，但是存底还未达到“最低限度的安全水平”的二十亿美元的数量。法国情形则更悲惨。到今年四月法国的黄金美元储备减少到五亿美元左右，不足战前的百分之十四。在美元荒与通货膨胀的双重冲击下，法郎信用暴跌，成为欧洲最不稳定的货币。
    在这种情况下，英法两国的政府还不停止军备竞赛，而企图用加紧对人民的掠夺以避免崩溃，这无异饮鸩止渴。英国的工党政府已迫使英国人民在战后忍受了五年节衣缩食的生活，而邱吉尔上台之后，又三番两次宣布“节约计划”，一再削减食物和日用必需品的进口以及削减社会福利事业的开支。但是，这种残害人民的饥饿政策，不但未能使经济情况好转，反而更加恶化。几个月来，由于缺乏原料，英国出口日益减少（第二季出口总值比第一季减少了百分之十三），美元黄金储备继续损耗，国内物价急剧上涨（上半年生活费平均上升百分之六），失业人数大量增加（据英国劳工部调查，四月份比三月份增多了五万人）。因此邱吉尔在今年六月惊呼：“经济危机的严重性并不亚于战时伦敦的被炸”。最近英国政府又宣布采取进一步削减进口和增加出口的所谓“紧急措施”，实际上这依然是要人民把裤带勒得更紧的政策，它不但不能挽救英国的经济危机，相反的只会招致经济上和政治上更严重的恶果。因为削减进口一方面意味着还要不断减少英国人民已经少得可怜的食物和日用品，造成物价继续上升和通货膨胀的更加恶化；另一方面，原料进口的削减，将使民用工业的生产更形萎缩。至于制成品的出口，则因为各资本主义国家的限制入口措施以及英国遵从美国对苏联和人民民主国家采取贸易歧视政策而找不到市场。因此，英国希望借此平衡英国的国际收支，是办不到的。前英国工党政府贸易大臣威尔逊也曾指出：“惊慌失措的措施、削减进口以及其他等等办法都不能解决问题。……除非美国和世界其他国家之间的经济关系改变，否则威胁英国的持续危机就无法消除。如果不真正大大减轻军备负担，那么我们面对这个危机只有束手无策。”
    法国的情形也是一样。早在去年底，法国政府为了挽救濒于破产的经济危机，也曾采取过一个所谓“节约计划”，大量削减美元货物的进口，今年二月又再扩大入口限制并削减民事费用，可是仍然没有能够阻止美元危机的进一步恶化。到六月底法国已欠欧洲支付同盟四亿二千万美元。法国政府曾把希望寄托在美国的“援助”上，最近向美国乞讨军火订单的要求遭到了拒绝，因此便惊恐万状，说要采取“更严峻的措施”以避免经济的崩溃。这个所谓“更严峻的措施”不是大量削减军火的生产，而是进一步削减政府的民用开支，减少社会保险和建设费用。这只能给法国人民制造更多的灾难。
    英法政府这种“大炮代替黄油”的政策，必然要受到人民日益坚决的反对。英法两国人民的生活水平已降到极低的程度。英国生活费用过去一年来提高了百分之二十五以上，法国工人的实际工资不及战前的一半。广大劳动人民的进一步贫困，必然引起国内阶级矛盾更加尖锐，将使愈来愈多的人民积极起来参加争取面包与和平的斗争。英国九百万工人最近针对政府的饥饿政策已提出增加工资的要求，法国工会也宣布下月将要求提高工资。英法人民反饥饿和贫穷的斗争，将随着两国经济危机的加深而扩大，这不仅成为美帝国主义推行扩军备战政策的重大障碍，且将使英法的经济危机变成严重的政治危机。
