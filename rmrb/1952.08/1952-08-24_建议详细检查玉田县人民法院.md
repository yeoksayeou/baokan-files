    Suggest Detailed Inspection of the Yutian County People's Court
    Editor: The president of the Yutian County People's Court in Hebei Province, Kai Yuan, the vice president, Zhou Yushan, and the judges have consistently used torture to extract confessions. For example, when interrogating Zhang Wentai, they put handcuffs on him, and the handcuffs cut into his flesh. Eventually, they used a small saw to cut the flesh and the handcuffs together. When interrogating Yu Dong, they handcuffed him for ninety-six hours, causing permanent damage to Yu's little finger. They also used torture to extract confessions from others, such as Liu Ying, Zhou Xingyuan, Zhang Shankui, Zhang Hua, Zhang Zuobin, Liang Yuzhu, Jiang Fengtong, Hu Qingliang, Zhang Wenxing, and Li Xiaoshan. The Yutian County People's Court's method of dealing with escaped prisoners is also inappropriate. Once, four prisoners escaped from the court's detention center, and three were later recaptured. After they were brought back, the warden of the detention center hung these three prisoners up and beat them, using handcuffs, which resulted in Liang Yuzhu and Jiang Fengtong being crippled. The Yutian County People's Court also arbitrarily detained people. A man named Qi Yu'en was accused of being "reactionary" by village cadres and sent to the county people's court because he said that certain district cadres were involved in corruption and were protecting village cadres who violated laws and regulations. The county people's court did not conduct an investigation and detained Qi for one year and five months. As a result, they announced that Qi was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Qi pointed out that he had already been detained for one year and five months, so the county people's court then announced that Qi's sentence was changed to one and a half years.
    As the national judicial community is carrying out a reform movement, it is suggested that the higher-level court conduct a detailed inspection of the Yutian County People's Court.

    建议详细检查玉田县人民法院
    编辑同志：河北省玉田县人民法院院长开源、副院长周玉山和审判员们，一贯用肉刑逼供。如审讯张文台时，给张文台带上铐子，铐子铐到肉里，最后用小锯把肉和铐子一起锯下来。审讯郁东时，用铐子铐了九十六小时，使郁的小拇指残废了。其他如审讯刘英、周兴元、张善奎、张华、张作彬、梁玉柱、蒋凤桐、胡庆良、张文兴、李小山等人时，也是逼供。玉田县人民法院处理逃犯的办法也是不妥当的。有一次，该院看守所的犯人逃了四个，后来抓回三个。抓回后，看守所所长便把这三个犯人吊起来打，用铐子铐，结果把其中的梁玉柱、蒋凤桐弄残废了。玉田县人民法院也发生胡乱扣押群众的事件。一个叫齐雨恩的，因为说某区干部有贪污行为并包庇违法乱纪的村干部，被村干部指为“反动”，送交县人民法院。县人民法院不进行调查研究，就把齐押了一年零五个月。结果宣布判齐有期徒刑一年。齐提出他已经被扣一年零五个月了，于是县人民法院又宣布改判齐有期徒刑一年半。
    正当全国司法界开展改革运动的今天，建议上级法院对玉田县人民法院详细检查。
