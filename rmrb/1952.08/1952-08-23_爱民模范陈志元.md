Model of Cherishing the People, Chen Zhiyuan

　　On the morning of November 25, 1951, Tai'an Port, Qidong County, Northern Jiangsu, was covered with dark clouds and swept by howling winds. A civilian boat with a half-raised sail was heading towards the riverbank. The small boat was already unable to control itself, tossed about in the raging waves. A gust of wind capsized the boat. Immediately, two small rowing boats were launched from the port to rescue the passengers. The small boats had barely travelled any distance before they were half-filled with water and could no longer advance, forcing them to return to their original position.

　　The twenty-odd passengers in distress on the river were desperately shouting for help. The weather was cold, and the waves were high. The people on the shore were trying to find a larger boat to rescue them. At this critical moment, Comrade Chen Zhiyuan, a soldier of the Second Squad of the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed at Tai'an Port, unhesitatingly took off his cotton-padded coat and jumped into the cold, turbulent river. In a short while, Chen Zhiyuan returned to the shore, holding two children in his arms and carrying a girl on his back. He repeatedly went back and forth in the cold river more than ten times, rescuing six people, and also recovered a corpse and a bicycle. At that time, under the leadership of Comrade Chen Zhiyuan, soldiers Zhou Zhengbang, Qing Yunu, Xia Yongqing, Huang Wengao and two young people also successively went into the water to assist in the rescue. Soon, the large boat in the port also arrived. As a result, all twenty-eight passengers in distress on the boat, except for one who drowned and one who went missing, were rescued.

　　Comrade Chen Zhiyuan spent too long a time going back and forth in the cold, biting river, and his voice had become hoarse with cold. However, when he saw an old lady who had been rescued shivering and unable to stand, he quickly put his own cotton-padded coat on her. The old lady was so moved that she shed tears and said, "Comrade of the People's Liberation Army, you are my life-saving benefactor, and you are a loved one I will never forget!"

　　Comrade Chen Zhiyuan's selfless action of rescuing passengers in distress received enthusiastic praise and respect from the people of Tai'an Port. An old woman from a distillery quickly brought a cotton-padded quilt from her home and affectionately wrapped it around Chen Zhiyuan. The rescued passengers thanked Comrade Chen Zhiyuan with tears in their eyes, and expressed that they would never forget the kindness of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　After learning of this, the Political Department of the Northern Jiangsu Military Region Headquarters immediately issued a circular commending Comrade Chen Zhiyuan's exemplary action and awarded Comrade Chen a special meritorious service award for "Model of Cherishing the People." Zu Dingyuan

    爱民模范陈志元
    一九五一年十一月二十五日早晨，苏北启东县泰安港口，乌云笼罩着，寒风狂啸着，江面上一只挂着半篷的民船，向江岸驶行。小船在惊涛骇浪中已颠簸得不能自主。一阵狂风，把船刮翻了。立刻，港内放出两只小划船去抢救旅客。小划船行不多远，就被刮进了半舱水，再也不能前进，被迫退回原地。
    在江面遇险的二十多个乘客，拚命喊救。天冷、风浪大，岸上群众正在想法放大船去救。就在这危急的时候，驻泰安港口的中国人民解放军某部五连二班战士陈志元同志，毫不犹豫地脱下棉衣，跳进了寒冷的汹涌的江水中。不一会，陈志元两臂夹着两个小孩，肩上还背着一个姑娘，奋力地回到了岸上。他接连在寒冷的江水中来回了十余次，救出了六个人，还打捞到一具尸体和一辆自行车。当时，在陈志元同志的带动下，同班战士周正邦、清玉囡、夏永清、黄文皋和两个青年群众也相继下水，协同抢救。不久，港内的大船也到了。结果，全船二十八个遇险旅客，除一人淹死、一人失踪外，全部脱险。
    陈志元同志往返在寒冷刺骨的江水中时间过久，嗓子也已冻哑了。但他见到一位被救出的老太太冻得混身发抖，立不住脚时，却连忙把自己的棉衣给她穿上了。那老太太感动得流泪说：“解放军同志是我的救命恩人，是我永远忘不了的亲人！”
    陈志元同志奋不顾身地抢救遇险乘客的行动，得到泰安港人民的热烈赞誉和崇敬。一个酒坊里的老妈妈赶快从家里抱了一条棉被，亲切地给陈志元披上了。被救出的乘客们满眶热泪地向陈志元同志道谢，并且表示永远不忘毛主席、共产党和中国人民解放军的恩情。
    苏北军区司令部政治部知道这事后，立即通报表扬了陈志元同志的模范行动，并给陈同志记了“爱民模范”特等功一次。祖鼎元
