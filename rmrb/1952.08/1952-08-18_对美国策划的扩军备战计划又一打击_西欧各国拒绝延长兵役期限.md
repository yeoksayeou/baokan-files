    Another Blow to the U.S.-Orchestrated Arms Expansion and War Preparations Plan
    Western European Countries Refuse to Extend Military Service
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 15th] Paris dispatch: Representatives from the six so-called “European Defense Community” members—France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—held a meeting in Paris on the 12th to discuss the issue of the term of military service for the so-called "European Army." Prior to the meeting, the United States had been strenuously urging Western European countries to extend the term of military service to two years. Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic aggressive forces, Ridgway, specifically emphasized at a press conference on the 11th that abandoning the idea of a two-year term of military service was "utterly unreasonable." However, according to reports from American and British news agencies, during the meeting on the 12th, representatives from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and other countries refused to extend the term of military service to two years. The meeting failed to reach an agreement on the term of military service for the "European Army." This is another blow to the arms expansion plan orchestrated by the United States for the North Atlantic bloc, following the announcements by Britain and France of their plans to cut back on their arms expansion.
    The ruling groups of Western European countries do not dare to rashly agree to the U.S. demand to extend the term of military service because they cannot but consider the strong anti-arms expansion and war preparation sentiment of the Western European people. This sentiment is prominently manifested in the recent nationwide movement in Belgium against extending the term of military service. Under pressure from the people, the Belgian cabinet decided on the 13th to effectively shorten the originally determined term of military service to twenty-one months.
    Italian democratic newspapers, in commenting on the failure of the Paris meeting, unanimously emphasized that the main reason for Ridgway's unexpected failure this time was the opposition of the broad masses and public opinion in Western European countries to the U.S. war plan. "Unità" said: The representatives attending the Paris meeting understood that the attempt to forcibly impose longer terms of military service on the youth of various countries under the orders of the United States would cause the same protest movements in those countries as in Belgium.

    对美国策划的扩军备战计划又一打击
    西欧各国拒绝延长兵役期限
    【新华社十五日讯】巴黎消息：法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡等六个所谓“欧洲防御集团”成员的代表十二日在巴黎举行会议，讨论所谓“欧洲军”的兵役期限问题。美国曾在会议以前竭力促使西欧各国延长兵役期限至两年，北大西洋侵略军总司令李奇微十一日在记者招待会上特别强调说，放弃两年兵役期限的想法是“十分不合理的”。但是，据美英通讯社透露，在十二日会议上，法国、意大利、荷兰、卢森堡等国代表都拒绝把兵役期限延长到二年。会议结果未能就“欧洲军”兵役期限取得协议。这是继英法两国宣布准备削减扩军计划以后，对美国所策划的北大西洋集团扩军计划的又一打击。
    西欧各国统治集团不敢贸然答应美国主张延长兵役期限的要求，是因为他们不能不考虑到西欧人民强烈反对扩军备战的情绪。这种情绪突出地表现在比利时最近爆发的全国规模的反对延长兵役期限的运动上。比利时内阁迫于人民的压力，已在十三日决定实际上把原已确定的兵役期限缩短为二十一个月。
    意大利民主报纸在评论巴黎会议的失败时一致强调指出：这一次李奇微之所以遭到意外的失败，主要是由于西欧各国的广大群众和舆论界对美国战争计划采取反对态度。“团结报”说：出席巴黎会议的代表们了解到：在美国的命令下强行对各国青年们实施更长的兵役期限的企图，将会在各国引起和比利时同样的抗议运动。
