    Striving for Peace in Asia, the Pacific Region, and the World
    ——Written for "People's China"
    Song Qingling
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, scheduled to be held in Beijing this September, will convene at a crucial juncture. Today, in any part of the world, peace is by no means an irrelevant issue. It can be stated with absolute certainty that in the Asian and Pacific regions, peace is a pressing practical matter. Here, war is actually raging in several places. The United States, violating the clearly expressed will of the Japanese people, is remilitarizing Japan, preparing to turn it into a base for aggression once again; the United States government is exerting crude and cruel economic and political pressure on certain countries in Latin America and Asia, attempting to force them to join the war camp; the American generals, in order to create more pain for themselves, continue to sabotage the Korean armistice talks, intensifying the criminal bombing of women, children, and the elderly in Korean cities already reduced to ruins, and implementing so-called military pressure by bombing peaceful facilities. This adds new crimes to their record of countless offenses—the most heinous of which is germ warfare.

    The brutality and aggressive nature of American Far East policy, coupled with the recent arrogant behavior of Western countries in Europe, have seriously deteriorated the international situation. Many people around the world are deeply disturbed by this situation. Each successive blow makes them more alarmed, more worried, and more resentful about this phenomenon. Everyone sees the growing threat to themselves: their families will be destroyed, or they will lose their loved ones. Every patriot sees the threat to their country: the opportunity to harness nature and build a happy life for the people will vanish in an instant in the midst of blood and fire. Therefore, an task has emerged for more and more people in the East and West: how to confront and stop this threat.

    To bear offspring, to engage in construction, and to promote human well-being—these are the primary missions of human life. To fulfill these missions, peace is a necessary condition. But we know that the kind of peace we need and so earnestly desire must be striven for to be obtained. That small handful of warmongers are cunning and violent, and they will not easily abandon their conspiracies to pursue profits. We have seen time and again that they think they can brazenly violate the wishes of the people, and they are ready to create excuses at any time to launch or expand wars. This means that the forces of peace, the millions upon millions of ordinary people, must remain vigilant and resolutely oppose being led down the path of destruction. We must speak out loudly, and we must turn our demand for peaceful coexistence among us and all nations and countries into a loud and powerful voice. We must take active action, and along with the calls for peace and cooperation from many countries and many people, we must mobilize all the forces of every country. This means that if we do not want to be deceived, misled, or manipulated by the few who are determined to destroy us, the majority of us must further organize ourselves to safeguard progress and civilization.

    The importance of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in this regard cannot be overestimated. The five hundred delegates representing sixteen hundred million people will shoulder a difficult task, but they will also have an opportunity to create peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, which will undoubtedly prove to be a central factor in maintaining world peace. With the support of the greatest peace movement in human history—the World Peace Council—and with the support of the prestigious and growing national peace organizations, this conference is able to take unprecedented steps to seek unity in order to achieve peace in the most densely populated region of the world.

    We have a broad foundation to build this unity; that foundation is that the conditions within the Asian and Pacific region have commonalities, which has a significant impact on how we view peace.

    Peace has multiple meanings for the people of Asia and the Pacific region. Peace does not only mean the absence of all-out war. Our long experience of suffering proves that even in the absence of all-out war, there is no peace to speak of for those countries suffering from imperialist oppression. There may be peace elsewhere, but in countries like ours, imperialism is threatening our very existence. Most of our countries have a glorious past, enormous potential for building prosperous economies, and highly developed cultures. But imperialism attempts to obliterate our past, turning the economies of many of our countries into fatally flawed single-crop economies, or merely suppliers of raw materials and cheap labor. It destroys our cultures and attempts to replace them with its own. This is the situation of imperialism rampant in many places in Asia and the Pacific. It has brought us enormous poverty and ignorance, staggering mortality rates, and appalling stagnation. It has aroused the anger of all of us.

    Therefore, in the eyes of the people of Asia and the Pacific countries, peace and national independence are closely linked and inseparable. Peace must be built on the basis of equality among all nations and the establishment of mutually beneficial relations among countries. All this is only possible when the people of each country are able to manage their own country according to their own wishes and in their best interests, free from external interference. And this is closely linked to the question of establishing a peace in which countries can cooperate with each other in accordance with the greatest interests of the whole world, no matter how great the differences in their political and economic systems.

    This concept of peace is widely accepted by the people of Asia and the Pacific countries. In any stratum of the people—whether among workers, farmers, intellectuals, government officials, or business people—significant parts of this view, or the whole view, can be found. This view has become our fundamental view of today's world situation. It can be said that this view, which has arisen from previous examples, has been further enhanced immeasurably by the victory of the Chinese people.

    China was once called the "Sick Man of Asia" in modern history. This was how many people saw us, some out of pity, others out of ridicule. Now, no one should doubt that today such pity is no longer appropriate, and ridicule has proven to be only an underestimation that has backfired on the ridiculer. Because in just three short years, the Chinese people have raised their country to its proper place, becoming one of the leaders in the world. We have restored our national dignity. We have forged a new power. The achievement of these earth-shaking achievements is because we have victoriously carried out the struggle for independence, and because we have proclaimed and implemented a system of people's democracy. With these victories, with the leaping progress we are making in building our motherland, we have set a new example for the people of Asia and the Pacific. We have given them a new perspective on their own problems.

    The reason why the Chinese people now enjoy increasing prestige is also because of our unwavering commitment to peace. Peace is the tradition of our country and nation. In the thousands of years during which we Chinese people have maintained relations with the people of Asia and the Pacific countries, we have never had any belligerent actions. In the current period, peace is the fundamental principle of the foreign policy of our People's Republic of China. We have demonstrated in every way that for us, seeking peace is a major undertaking. We, whether as a whole or as individuals, in carrying out our country's policies, in defending our homeland, the principles that guide and determine our actions have always been the demands of peace.

    The people of Asia and the Pacific region have recognized this fact; their sending representatives to our capital to take new and historic steps to seek peace is sufficient proof of this. Beijing was born in the midst of the unity of the Chinese people. Now, in the struggle of the people of Asia and the Pacific countries for harmonious coexistence among all nations, Beijing has become the birthplace of their new unity.

    Thus, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is the result of the general surge of the global peace movement. The people of the various countries who are sending representatives to this conference will have a solid foundation of unity, because peace is what they demand, and peace is an element in solving their domestic problems. Finally, this peace conference will be held in a country, city, and people dedicated to maintaining and defending world peace and cooperation. The results of the conference will certainly be very fruitful and brilliant.

    We can be sure that these results will be very different from the results of another conference recently held in the Asia-Pacific region. I am referring here to the conference convened by the U.S. government to establish the "Pacific Council." At this conference, they also talked about peace, but in fact, they were planning further aggression. At this conference, they also talked about cooperation with "backward" countries, but in fact, they were implementing plans for further enslavement of certain Asian and Pacific countries. At this conference, they also talked about the so-called equality of all nations, but in fact, the only country that gave orders to this "Council" was the government of one country—the United States.

    It must be pointed out that the American politicians leading this war council in no way represent the American people. In fact, the American people could not even get to the door of the conference. This is in sharp contrast to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference; the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will be a platform from which the voices of the real American people can be heard.

    We sincerely hope that the American people can send a large delegation to the peace conference. The American people are members of a Pacific nation, and the issues we are deciding are indeed in their interest; they can indeed make a contribution. The conference will give them the opportunity to understand what this region of the world is thinking. Many terrible things have been done in their name. They should understand the truth about these actions. They should also understand that the people of Asia and the Pacific countries separate them clearly from the real criminals who are carrying out these actions, and I believe we can make them clearly aware of this fact.

    We hope that the representatives of the American people can come to meet us in person and directly understand the new developments that are taking place. We want to assure them that we, or any people holding power in any country, will not threaten them or their way of life. We believe that we can prove to them that the threat exists in their own country, that their enemies and our enemies are the same enemy. We want the American people to know that there are many reasons why our peoples and our countries should cooperate, and no reason to fight each other.

    We, the people of Asia and the Pacific countries, want to work with the American people to answer the question: "Who is getting rich from waging war in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, concluding one-sided treaties that treat other countries as colonies, rearming, and restricting trade and cultural exchanges?" On the one hand, American companies made $44.8 billion in profits in 1951, eight times what they made before World War II; on the other hand, America's national income has been swallowed up by taxes and the killing and destruction carried out by their government in the Far East. We want to work with the American people to study the relationship between these two facts. We know that all these things are directly related, and we believe that the representatives of the American people will agree with us.

    That is to say, we and they, and all peace-loving people, face a common enemy, a handful of villains who make money from war. In the struggle against this enemy, in the struggle for survival, for peace, the people of Asia and the Pacific countries see the American people as an ally, a very important ally. We hope that they will fight with us with all their strength. We hope that they will work with us to create peace, and then make this world a place full of productive labor and joy, a place where their children and our children can live in peace. We will grasp their hands in this greatest of crusades, making our era one of the most beautiful in world history.

    The representatives of the many countries working together in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will surely achieve the unity of all races, colors, creeds, and religions, and strive for peace! We will work together to lay the foundation for the people of Asia and the Pacific countries to participate in the extraordinarily significant World People's Peace Congress in December of this year! We will take great strides together towards a world of the people!

    为亚洲、太平洋区域和全世界的和平而奋斗
    ——为“人民中国”而作
    宋庆龄
    定于今年九月在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，即将在极关紧要的时机举行了。今天，在全世界任何地方，和平都绝不是一个与实际无关的问题。可以绝对肯定地说，在亚洲及太平洋地区，和平是一个迫切的实际问题。在这里，战争实际上正在几个地方进行着。美国违反日本人民明白表示的意志，正在使日本重新军国主义化，准备把它再度变成侵略的基地；美国政府正在对拉丁美洲和亚洲的某些国家施以粗暴残酷的经济和政治压力，企图强迫这些国家参加战争阵营；美国将军们为自己制造更多的痛苦，继续破坏朝鲜停战谈判，对已经化为废墟的朝鲜城市中的妇孺老幼加紧进行罪恶的轰炸，用轰炸和平设施来实行所谓军事压力。这就在他们罪案如山的记录中——其中最恶毒的就是细菌战——，又加上了新的罪行。
    美国远东政策的残暴和侵略性质，加上西方国家最近在欧洲的蛮横行为，已使国际局势严重恶化。全世界许多人士都为这种情况忡忡不安。连接而来的每一个打击都使他们对这种现象更加惊慌，更加忧虑，也更加恼怒。每一个人都看到自己受到的威胁愈来愈大：自己的家庭将要受到破坏，或是失去自己的亲人。每一个爱国者都看到自己的国家受到的威胁：驾驭自然和为人民建设幸福生活的机会将在一霎眼间消失在血火之中。因此，对东方西方越来越多的人民就产生了一个任务：怎样对付和制止这种威胁。
    生育后代、从事建设和增进人类福利——这是人的一生的主要使命。而要完成这些使命，和平就是必要的条件。但我们所需要的和这样热切期望的这种和平，我们都知道是必须努力去争取才能得到的。那一小撮战争贩子是狡猾而狂暴的，他们不会轻易放弃追逐利润的阴谋。我们已经一再地看到，他们以为他们可以悍然违反人民的愿望，他们准备随时制造藉口来发动战争或扩大战争。这就是说，和平的力量，千千万万的普通人必须保持警惕，必须坚决反对把他们引上灭亡的道路。我们必须大声疾呼，我们必须把我们和一切民族一切国家和平共存的要求变为响亮的有力的声音。我们必须积极行动，随着许多国家许多人士发出和平和合作的呼声，我们必须动员每个国家的一切力量。这就是说，如果我们不愿被一心要毁灭我们的少数人迷惑、欺骗或操纵的话，我们占大多数的人就必须把自己进一步组织起来，以维护进步和文明。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在这一方面的重要性，是无论怎样估计也不为过的。代表十六亿人民的五百名代表将担负一个艰巨的任务，但他们也得到一个机会来缔造亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，这个区域的和平无疑会证明是维护世界和平的中心因素。在人类历史上最伟大的和平运动——世界和平理事会的支持下，在威信卓著的日益发展的各国和平组织的支持下，这个会议是能够采取前所未有的步骤谋求团结，以在世界上人口最稠密的地区实现和平的。
    我们有广泛的基础来建立这种团结；这种基础就是：亚洲及太平洋地区内的状况有共同之处，这一点对我们怎样看待和平有着重大的影响。
    和平对亚洲和太平洋地区的人民有多方面的意义。和平不仅是意味着没有全面战争。我们长期的痛苦经验证明，即令是在没有全面战争的时候，那些遭受帝国主义压迫的国家也决无和平可言。别的地方也许有和平，但在我们这样一些国家，帝国主义却正威胁着我们的生存。我们大多数国家都有光荣的过去，有着可以建立繁荣的经济的巨大潜能，有着高度的文化。但帝国主义企图把我们的过去化为乌有，它把我们许多国家的经济变成了置之于死命的单一作物经济，或者仅仅是原料和廉价劳动力的供应者。它破坏了我们的文化，并企图用它自己的文化来代替我们的文化。这就是帝国主义在亚洲和太平洋许多地方横行的情况。它给我们带来了巨大的贫困和愚昧，惊人的死亡率和可怕的停滞。它激起了我们大家的愤怒。
    因此，在亚洲及太平洋各国人民看来，和平和民族独立是密切联系而不可分的。和平必须建筑在一切民族平等和各国建立互利关系的基础上。只有各国人民能够按照自己的愿望，按照自己最大的利益，不受外来干涉自己管理自己的国家的时候，这一切才有可能。而这又和建立这样的和平的问题密切联系着，在这样的和平中，各个国家能够按照全世界最大的利益互相合作，无论它们的政治制度和经济制度有着多么大的不同。
    这种对和平的观念是亚洲和太平洋各国人民所广泛接受的。无论在那一个阶层的人民里——无论在工人、农民、知识分子、政府官员或工商界人士当中，都可以找得到这种见解的重要部分，或者这种见解的全部。这种看法，已成了我们对今天世界局势的根本见解。可以说，这种由于以前的事例而产生的见解，已经因为中国人民的胜利而进一步无限地提高了。
    中国在近代历史中曾经一度被称为“亚洲病夫”。这曾经是许多人对我们的看法，有些人是出于怜悯，有些人则是出于嘲讽。现在，应该谁都不再怀疑，今天这样的怜悯已经不恰当了，嘲讽则已证明只是使嘲讽者自己倒霉的过低估计了。因为在短短的三年里，中国人民已使他们的国家提高到应有的地位，成了世界上的领导者之一。我们恢复了我们的民族尊严。我们锻炼出了一股新的威力。这些震撼大地的成就的取得，是因为我们胜利地进行了争取独立的斗争，是因为我们宣告并实行了人民民主制度。我们以这些胜利，以我们在建设祖国当中的飞跃进步，为亚洲和太平洋人民树立了一个新的范例。我们使他们对他们自己的问题能有新的看法。
    中国人民现在之所以享有日益增高的威信，还有另外一个原因，这就是我们坚定不移地维护和平。和平是我们国家和民族的传统。在我们中国人和亚洲和太平洋各国人民保持着来往关系的几千年中，我们从来不曾有过好战的举动。在目前的时期里，和平是我们中华人民共和国外交政策的基本原则。我们已经在一切方面证明，对于我们来说，谋求和平是重大的事业。我们，无论作为整体或作为个人来说，在执行我国的政策的时候，在保卫我们国土的时候，指导和决定我们的行动的原则始终是对和平的要求。
    亚洲和太平洋地区的人民已认识到这个事实；他们派遣代表到我们的首都，为谋求和平而采取新的历史性的步骤，就足以证明这一点。北京，是在中国人民团结的中间诞生出来的。现在，在亚洲和太平洋各国人民争取各国和谐共处的斗争中，北京又成了他们新的团结的发祥地。
    这样看来，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议是全世界和平运动普遍高涨的结果。派代表出席这次会议的各国人民将有一个巩固的团结基础，因为和平是他们所要求的，和平是解决他们本国问题的一个要素。最后，这次和平会议要在一个致力于维护和保卫世界安宁与合作的国家、城市和人民中举行。会议的成果一定会非常丰硕而辉煌。
    我们可以确信，这些成果一定和最近在亚洲及太平洋地区举行的另一个会议的成果大不相同。我这里所指的是美国政府为成立“太平洋理事会”而召开的会议。在这个会议上，他们口里也谈和平，然而事实上却是策划更进一步的侵略。在这个会议上，他们口里也谈和“落后”国家合作，然而事实上他们却实行更进一步奴役某些亚洲和太平洋国家的计划。在这个会议上，他们也谈所谓各国人民的平等，然而事实上对这个“理事会”发号施令的只不过是一个国家——美国的政府。
    必须指出，领导这个战争理事会的美国政客们丝毫不能代表美国人民。事实上美国人民甚至不能走到会议的门前。这和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议恰成鲜明对照；亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将是一个讲坛，从这里可以听到真正的美国人民的声音。
    我们诚恳地希望美国人民能够派遣一个很大的代表团出席和平会议。美国人民是一个太平洋国家的成员，我们所决定的问题对他们确实有利害关系；他们也确实能够作出贡献。会议将使他们有机会了解世界的这个地区在想些什么。已经有人用他们的名义做出了许多可怕的事情。他们应该了解这些行为的真相。他们也应该了解亚洲和太平洋各国人民是把他们和进行这些行为的真正罪犯截然分开的，我相信我们能够使他们清楚地认识这个事实。
    我们希望美国人民的代表能够亲自来和我们相会，直接了解正在发展的新事态。我们要向他们保证，我们或任何人民掌握政权的国家，都不会威胁他们或他们的生活方式。我们认为，我们能够向他们证明威胁存在于他们自己的国家里，他们的敌人和我们的敌人是同一个敌人。我们要美国人民知道，我们各国人民和各个国家有许多理由应该合作，而没有任何理由互相作战。
    我们这些亚洲和太平洋国家人民要和美国人民一道来答复这个问题：“在朝鲜、越南和马来亚进行战争、订立把别的国家当做殖民地的片面条约、重整军备、限制贸易和文化交流——这一切究竟使谁发了财？”一方面，美国公司在一九五一年得到了四百四十八亿美元的利润，等于第二次世界大战前的八倍；另一方面，美国的国民收入却因为捐税及他们政府在远东进行的杀伤和破坏而被吞去了三分之一。我们要和美国人民一道来研究这两个事实之间的相互关系。我们知道这一切事情有着直接的关系，我们认为美国人民的代表会同意我们的意见。
    换言之，我们和他们以及一切爱好和平的人民面对着一个共同的敌人，一小撮靠战争发财的恶人。在反对这个敌人的斗争中，在争取生存、争取和平的斗争中，亚洲和太平洋各国人民把美国人民看做一个盟友，看做一个非常重要的盟友。我们希望他们全力和我们一道奋斗。我们希望他们和我们一道缔造和平，然后使这个世界成为一个充满有成果的劳动和欢乐的地方，成为他们的孩子和我们的孩子都能够平安地生活的地方。我们将要在这个最伟大的十字军中握紧他们的手，使我们的时代成为世界历史上一个最美好的时代。
    在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议中共同工作的许多国家的代表，必将实现一切种族、肤色、信仰和宗教的团结，为争取和平而奋斗！我们将在一道，为亚洲及太平洋各国人民在今年十二月参加具有非常性质的世界人民和平大会奠定基础！我们将一道为争取一个人民的世界而大踏步前进！
