The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government Regarding Measures for Reduction and Exemption of Agricultural Tax for Disaster-stricken Farmers
(Promulgated on August 14, 1952)

Article 1. Any disaster-stricken farmer whose crops have been reduced due to water, drought, wind, hail, disease, pests, or other disasters shall have their agricultural tax reduced or exempted in accordance with these regulations.

Article 2. The agricultural tax for disaster-stricken farmers shall be reduced or exempted based on the percentage of crop failure for all crops throughout the year. The percentage of crop failure refers to the percentage of the total crop yield lost due to disaster compared to the normal annual yield.

Article 3. Disaster-stricken farmers shall be divided into the following five categories based on the severity of the disaster, and their agricultural tax shall be reduced or exempted accordingly:
	First-degree disaster households: Those with a crop failure of 60% or more shall be exempted from the entire amount of tax payable.
	Second-degree disaster households: Those with a crop failure of 50% or more but less than 60% shall have 70% of the tax payable reduced.
	Third-degree disaster households: Those with a crop failure of 40% or more but less than 50% shall have 50% of the tax payable reduced.
	Fourth-degree disaster households: Those with a crop failure of 30% or more but less than 40% shall have 35% of the tax payable reduced.
	Fifth-degree disaster households: Those with a crop failure of 20% or more but less than 30% shall have 25% of the tax payable reduced.
Those with a crop failure of less than 20% shall not be granted reduction or exemption.

Article 4. For those whose summer crops have been reduced due to disaster, a portion or all of the tax may be deferred during the summer collection period. The total annual crop failure percentage shall be calculated by combining the yields from both the summer and autumn harvests, and reductions or exemptions shall be granted in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article.

Article 5. In areas that have been continuously affected by disasters for two or more years, in order to take care of the difficulties in farmers' lives and production, in addition to the reduction or exemption granted according to the crop failure percentage of the disaster-stricken farmers in the current year as stipulated in Article 3, the Provincial (Municipal) People's Government may also, based on the actual situation in the disaster area, submit a report to the Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Political Committee or Administrative Committee) for approval to increase the reduction percentage or grant full exemption.

Article 6. For the same type of land and the same type of crops that have suffered the same degree of damage from the same disaster, the crop failure percentage should be calculated the same. Those who have actively fought against the disaster and reduced the degree of damage shall still be calculated according to the same crop failure percentage, and the reduction percentage shall not be lowered. If the disaster situation is aggravated due to negligence in fighting the disaster, it should also be calculated according to the same crop failure percentage, and the reduction percentage shall not be increased.

Article 7. Disaster-stricken farmers shall truthfully declare the disaster situation to the Township (Village) People's Government. The Township (Village) Agricultural Tax Investigation and Evaluation Committee shall conduct investigation and evaluation, create a register of crop failure for disaster-stricken farmers, and submit it to the County (City) People's Government. After receiving the register, the County (City) People's Government shall promptly review it and send personnel to investigate, and telegraph the results to the Provincial People's Government. The Provincial People's Government may send personnel to re-inspect when necessary.

Article 8. After the disaster situation investigation is completed, the County (City) People's Government or the Municipal People's Government under the Greater Administrative Region shall calculate the amount of tax reduction or exemption for each disaster-stricken farmer in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 5 of these regulations, and issue reduction and exemption certificates separately. Disaster-stricken farmers shall present the certificate to the designated granary or institution to offset the tax amount. The printing, issuance, and management methods of the aforementioned reduction and exemption certificates shall be formulated by the Provincial (Municipal) People's Government.

Article 9. The County (City) People's Government shall prepare a statistical table of the disaster reduction and exemption situation at the end of each year and submit it to the Provincial People's Government. The Provincial People's Government shall compile four copies of the statistical table and submit them to the Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Political Committee or Administrative Committee) for verification and forwarding to the Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for record. The municipalities directly under the Central Government and the municipalities under the Greater Administrative Region shall have their respective municipal people's governments prepare statistical tables and submit them to the Municipal People's Government, which shall handle them in accordance with the preceding regulations.

Article 10. Government personnel who conceal disasters or make false reports shall be subject to disciplinary action. Farmers who falsely report disaster situations shall be investigated and corrected, and may also be fined in accordance with the regulations on evading agricultural tax.

Article 11. If the Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Political Committee or Administrative Committee) finds the situation to be special, it may formulate supplementary measures based on the spirit of these regulations and with reference to local conditions, and submit them to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval and implementation.

Article 12. These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

    中央人民政府政务院关于受灾农户农业税减免办法
    （一九五二年八月十四日公布）
    第一条  凡农作物因水、旱、风、雹、病、虫及其他灾害而致歉收的受灾农户，应依本办法减免其农业税。
    第二条  受灾农户的农业税，依该户全年全部农作物歉收成数，分别减征或免征。歉收成数，系指受灾农户全年全部因灾歉收的产量占常年应产量的成数。
    第三条  受灾农户依其受灾轻重，分为下列五等，减免农业税：一等灾户——歉收六成以上者，免征全部应交税额；二等灾户——歉收五成以上不到六成者，减征应交税额的七成；三等灾户——歉收四成以上不到五成者，减征应交税额的五成；四等灾户——歉收三成以上不到四成者，减征应交税额的三成半；五等灾户——歉收二成以上不到三成者，减征应交税额的二成半。歉收不到二成者，不予减免。
    第四条  夏季作物因灾歉收者，在夏征时，得酌情缓征一部或全部，俟秋征时，再按夏、秋两季歉收的产量合并算出全年歉收成数，依前条规定分别减免之。
    第五条  连续受灾二年以上的地区，为照顾农民生活和生产的困难，除按受灾农户当年歉收成数，依第三条规定予以减免外，并得由省（市）人民政府根据灾区实际情况，报请大行政区人民政府（军政委员会或行政委员会）批准，提高减征成数或全部免征。
    第六条  同等土地、同类作物，遭受同样和同等程度的灾害，应按同一歉收成数计算。其因积极抗灾而减轻受灾程度者，仍照同一歉收成数计算，不降低其减免成数；如因怠于抗灾而致灾情加重者，亦应照同一歉收成数计算，不提高其减征成数。
    第七条  受灾农户应据实向乡（村）人民政府申报灾情，由乡（村）农业税调查评议委员会进行调查评议，造具受灾农户歉收清册，报送县（市）人民政府。县（市）人民政府接到清册后，应即进行审核并派员查勘，将结果电报省人民政府。省人民政府于必要时得派员复勘。
    第八条  灾歉情况调查完毕后，由县（市）人民政府或大行政区辖市人民政府依本办法第三条及第五条规定，算出各受灾农户减免的税额后，分别填发减免证。受灾农户持证向指定粮库或机关抵交税额。前项减免证的印制、填发及保管办法，由省（市）人民政府订定之。
    第九条  县（市）人民政府应于每年年终时，将灾歉减免情况造具统计表，报送省人民政府，由省人民政府汇编统计表四份，报大行政区人民政府（军政委员会或行政委员会）核转中央人民政府政务院、内务部、财政部备查。中央直辖市、大行政区辖市应由该市区人民政府造具统计表报送市人民政府，由市人民政府按照前项规定办理。
    第十条  政府人员匿灾不报，或勘报不实者，应酌予处分；农户虚报灾情者，除查明纠正外，并得按逃避农业税的规定，酌处罚金。
    第十一条  各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会或行政委员会）如因情况特殊，得根据本办法的精神，参照当地情况，另订补充办法，报请中央人民政府政务院批准施行。
    第十二条  本办法自中央人民政府政务院公布之日施行。
