Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 7th: The "Pravda" published on the 5th a dispatch from its correspondent in Korea, Dekachenko. Dekachenko wrote: The so-called "presidential election" in South Korea is scheduled to be held on August 5th. Directly commanding the entire behind-the-scenes preparation for this election farce are the "occupying triumvirate" – American Ambassador Muccio, "United Nations Forces" Commander Clark, and Commander of the Eighth U.S. Army in Korea, Van Fleet.

Who do the American backstage bosses, who are organizing this election, intend to have as "president" of South Korea?

On July 27th, South Korean radio broadcast that Syngman Rhee, Cho Bong-am, Lee Si-young, and Shin Heung-woo would participate in the "presidential" election.

Every Korean knows that Syngman Rhee is an American citizen who lived in the United States for about thirty years, waiting for an opportunity to ride on the heads of the Korean people and implement "American ways" in what he calls "that wild area." In 1945, the baggage car of the American occupation army arrived in South Korea, bringing with it American citizen Syngman Rhee.

Among these candidates is the eighty-year-old Lee Si-young, a notorious embezzler of public funds and a long-time American spy. Shortly before the American intervention in Korea, he served as the "vice president" of South Korea, but was impeached for embezzling public funds and taking bribes, and then faded into obscurity until recently, when someone mentioned his name again.

The other two candidates – Cho Bong-am and Shin Heung-woo – are equally infamous. Cho Bong-am is a close friend of Muccio and MacArthur, the butcher who massacred the Korean people, and shared with MacArthur the gold and silver treasures stolen from Korean banks. Shin Heung-woo manages an "institution" that is a place where American officers humiliate Korean women.

The nine "vice presidential" candidates are also a bunch of traitors. The first candidate is the fifty-four-year-old Lee Bum-suk, the leader of a fascist terrorist youth organization serving American military intelligence. This "little hooligan" – as the Koreans call him – lived abroad for more than twenty years. He can't even speak Korean or write Korean characters. When he speaks to Koreans, he always speaks English or has an interpreter translate for him.

Another "vice presidential" candidate is the reactionary ringleader Han Tae-rong (transliteration), a terrorist and scab who has repeatedly shot at workers who held demonstrations in Seoul and Busan. Another candidate is Im Young-sin (Louis Im), who returned from the United States shortly after Syngman Rhee returned to the country.

Dekachenko wrote: Naturally, none of these people has the trust and support of the voters. The South Korean people are very indignant at this batch of "candidates" that the occupying forces are forcing them to accept.

While describing the fascist police terror atmosphere in which the American dictators are staging the "presidential election" farce in the South, the reporter listed many examples to illustrate how Korean patriots are actively and boldly taking action against the American-style "election" scam.

Dekachenko pointed out: The movement to boycott the presidential election in South Korea has spread everywhere, making Muccio, Clark, Van Fleet, and their puppets panic. Korean patriots recently threw grenades and bombs at Syngman Rhee's residence in Busan, scaring Syngman Rhee into leaving Busan under the guise of "seeking medical treatment" and going to a "safer place." He hid in the seaside resort of Jinhae, where there is an American naval base, to deliver campaign speeches.

"Vice presidential" candidates Lee Bum-suk, Louis Im, and others also did not appear before the voters.

However, election day is approaching. This farce must be played to the end – this is Washington's order. Therefore, Muccio, Clark, and Van Fleet are doing everything possible to carry out this order.

Syngman Rhee's agents, who were sent to each province and county to serve as "election supervisors," told the people that men and women with the right to vote would be deprived of their rations if they did not register and go to the polls, and that the homes of "bad elements" would be searched. Police officers patrolled the electoral districts day and night.

Under the guise of "exercises," Van Fleet has sent troops to Busan and Seoul. Several American warships have docked in Busan, and two American warships have also arrived in Incheon.

Dekachenko concluded: It is in this "calm and safe" atmosphere that overseas dictators are staging the election farce in South Korea.

### 美国侵略者使用法西斯警察手段  导演南朝鲜伪总统选举丑剧

    美国侵略者使用法西斯警察手段
    导演南朝鲜伪总统选举丑剧
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：“真理报”五日刊载了该报驻朝鲜记者德卡诚科写的一篇通讯。德卡诚科写道：南朝鲜的所谓“总统选举”定于八月五日举行。直接指挥这场选举把戏的整个幕后准备工作的是：“占领三巨头”——美国大使缪锡俄、“联合国军”总司令克拉克和侵朝美国第八军军长范佛里特。
    组织这次选举的美国后台老板，打算让谁当南朝鲜的“总统”呢？
    七月二十七日，南朝鲜电台广播说：李承晚、曹奉岩、李始荣和申兴雨将参加“总统”竞选。
    每个朝鲜人都知道，李承晚是一个美国公民，他曾在美国住了约三十年之久，等待机会骑在朝鲜人民头上并在他所说的“那个荒野的地区”实行“美国方式”。一九四五年，美国占领军的行李车抵达南朝鲜，也带来了美国公民李承晚。
    这些候选人中有八十岁的李始荣，这个人是一个声名狼籍的公款盗窃犯，长期担任美国间谍。在美国干涉朝鲜以前不久，他担任南朝鲜“副总统”，但因盗窃公款和受贿而受弹劾，后来就没没无闻，直到最近才有人提他的名字。
    另外两个候选人——曹奉岩和申兴雨，也同样声名狼籍。曹奉岩是缪锡俄和残杀朝鲜人民的刽子手麦克阿瑟的密友，曾和麦克阿瑟一道分享从朝鲜银行窃取到的金银财宝。申兴雨掌管一个“机关”，那是美国军官侮辱朝鲜女郎的场所。
    九个“副总统”候选人也是一帮卖国贼。第一个候选人是五十四岁的李范奭，这个人是替美国军事情报机关效劳的法西斯恐怖青年组织的首领。这个“小流氓”——朝鲜人对他的称呼——在外国住了二十多年。他甚至连朝鲜话都不会说、朝鲜字都不会写了，他对朝鲜人说话时总是说英语，或叫译员替他翻译。
    另一个“副总统”候选人是反动头子韩太荣（译音），这是一个恐怖分子和工贼，他曾多次枪击在汉城和釜山举行游行示威的工人。另外一个候选人是任永信（路易斯·任），他是在李承晚回国以后不久从美国回来的。
    德卡诚科写道：很自然，这些人个个都得不到选民的信任和支持。南朝鲜人民对占领军强迫他们接受的这一批“候选人”感到非常愤慨。
    记者一面描述美国独裁者是在怎样的法西斯警察恐怖气氛下在南部导演“总统选举”滑稽剧，一面列举了许许多多实例，来说明朝鲜爱国志士是怎样积极果敢地采取行动反对美国式的“选举”骗局。
    德卡诚科指出：南朝鲜的抵制总统选举的运动遍及各地，把缪锡俄、克拉克、范佛里特以及他们的傀儡弄得惶惶不安。朝鲜爱国志士最近曾向李承晚的釜山寓所扔手榴弹和炸弹，吓得李承晚用“看病”做幌子离开釜山，到“比较安全的地方”去。他躲在设有美国海军基地的海滨胜地镇海发表竞选演说。
    “副总统”候选人李范奭、路易斯·任等人也没有在选民面前露面。
    但是，选举日就要到了。这场滑稽戏必须演到底——这是华盛顿的命令。于是，缪锡俄、克拉克和范佛里特就想尽一切办法来执行这个命令。
    被派到各道各郡去担任“选举监督员”的李承晚代理人对人民说，有选举权的男子和妇女如果不登记，也不到投票处去，就要被剥夺口粮，“恶劣分子”将被抄家。警察人员不分昼夜地在选区巡逻。
    在“演习”的幌子下，范佛里特已派军队到釜山和汉城。几艘美国军舰已在釜山停泊下来，两艘美国军舰也已到达仁川。
    德卡诚科在结语中写道：海外独裁者就是在这种“平静而安全”的气氛下在南朝鲜导演选举滑稽剧的。
