    The Japanese People's Movement Against Conscription

    The reactionary Yoshida government of Japan has used recruitment methods and deceptive inducements in an attempt to realize its military expansion plan, but due to the Japanese people's widespread opposition to remilitarization, this recruitment plan has been severely frustrated. Now the Yoshida government is plotting to restore the militarist conscription system to force the Japanese people into military service. The "resident registration" that the Yoshida government forcibly implemented at the beginning of last month is one of the steps in preparing to restore the conscription system.

    The Yoshida reactionary government's purpose in expanding its military is to build a mercenary army for the United States, not to "defend Japan." Recent facts have fully demonstrated this. According to Tokyo news, 1,000 members of the Japanese "Police Reserve Force," after being trained in Soumagahara, Japan, have been sent to the Korean battlefield to serve as cannon fodder for American aggression. In addition, two platoons of the "Police Reserve Force" were even transferred to Geoje Island to persecute captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces. The Japanese "Police Reserve Force," which the Yoshida government is stepping up to expand, is clearly a tool of the American aggressors.

    The Japanese people have increasingly and profoundly recognized the vicious conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries against them from these facts. Now, the mass movement against conscription is unfolding throughout Japan and has become one of the main contents of the Japanese people's movement to defend peace. During the "Peace Movement Month" from June 25th to August 15th, the Japanese people took the anti-conscription movement a step further. Japanese workers, students, youth, women, and cultural figures have participated in this movement through meetings, collecting signatures, propaganda, and other means. Of particular significance is the anti-conscription movement of the broad masses of Japanese farmers. Bankrupt Japanese rural areas have always been the main source of cannon fodder for the Yoshida reactionary government. However, Japanese farmers are increasingly feeling the pain and burden brought to them by the Yoshida government's war preparations policy, and the American occupiers' large-scale requisition of land directly endangers their lives. After the Yoshida government and the United States signed a military base agreement on July 26, this situation has become even more serious. This has made the Japanese farmers' calls against remilitarization louder and louder. The Yoshida government's "resident registration" measures and the "Police Reserve Force's" recruitment activities in rural areas have been strongly opposed by farmers everywhere.

    The development of the Japanese people's movement against conscription will continuously strike at the Yoshida government's military expansion plan and will bring greater victories to the Japanese people's peace movement.

### 日本人民反对征兵的运动

    日本人民反对征兵的运动
    日本吉田反动政府曾使用招募的方式，和欺骗利诱的手段，企图实现它的扩军计划，但是由于日本人民普遍反对重新军国主义化，这个募兵计划遭到严重挫败。现在吉田政府正阴谋恢复军国主义的征兵制度，来强迫日本人民当兵。上月初吉田政府所强制实施的“居民登记”，就是准备恢复征兵制度的步骤之一。
    吉田反动政府扩军目的是替美国建立雇佣军，而不是为了“防卫日本”。最近的事实已经完全证明了这一点。据东京消息，日本“警察后备队”一千人在日本相马原受训之后，已被送往朝鲜战场，充当美国的侵略炮灰。另有两排“警察后备队”竟被调往巨济岛，迫害中、朝人民部队的被俘人员。吉田政府所加紧扩充的日本“警察后备队”，显然是美国侵略者的工具。
    日本人民从这些事实中，越来越深刻地认识到美日反动派对他们的恶毒阴谋。现在，反对征兵的群众运动正在日本各地普遍展开，并成为日本人民保卫和平运动的主要内容之一。在六月二十五日到八月十五日的“和平运动月”中，日本人民把反对征兵运动更向前推进了一步。日本工人、学生、青年、妇女和文化界人士，都用集会、征集签名、宣传等种种方式参加了这一运动。具有特别重要意义的，是日本广大农民的反对征兵运动。破产的日本农村，一直是吉田反动政府搜罗炮灰的主要来源地。但是日本农民日益感受到吉田政府备战政策给他们带来的痛苦和负担，而美国占领者大量征用土地更直接危害了他们的生活。在七月二十六日吉田政府和美国签订军事基地协定之后，这种情况是更加严重了。这就使日本农民反对重新军国主义化的呼声越来越高昂。吉田政府的“居民登记”措施，“警察后备队”员到农村的招兵活动，都遭到各地农民的强烈反对。
    日本人民反对征兵运动的发展，将给吉田政府扩军计划以不断的打击，将给日本人民的和平运动带来更大的胜利。
