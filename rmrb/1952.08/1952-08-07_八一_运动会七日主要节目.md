The sentence "The second place in the men's long jump is Luo Cai, deputy platoon leader of the Public Security Forces Motorcycle Company, and the third place is Li Chengxiang, squad leader of a certain company of the Public Security Forces" should read "Northeast Military Region" instead of "Public Security Forces."
