    We Show Movies in the Countryside
    Our team was established in December 1950. Up to August of this year, in the year and eight months, we successively brought more than 40 films, including "Steel Warrior," "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Red Flag on Cui Gang," "The White-Haired Girl," "A Daughter's Marriage," "Northern Shaanxi Pastoral Song," and "The Great Battle of Stalingrad," traveling throughout eleven special districts in Shandong Province. We screened 1,639 shows, allowing 12,266,000 people to see people's films and receive education. When we were in the Seventh District of Yidu County, an old lady, a family member of a volunteer soldier, was deeply moved after watching "Steel Warrior." She said, "I will definitely write a letter to my child when I get back, telling him to fight the American devils fiercely in Korea!" When we were screening "The Victory of the Chinese People" in Fujiatun, Jimo, the women were busy making military shoes. When they saw the soldiers marching arduously in the film, they said, "We will guarantee to make the military shoes strong and comfortable for the soldiers to wear, so that we can be worthy of the People's Liberation Army and our Chairman Mao!" Whenever Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the masses applauded and cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao!" They said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, we wouldn't have been able to turn ourselves around so thoroughly."
    The film team is welcomed everywhere, and the masses are excited by the arrival of the film team. An old lady in Mazhuang, Yidu, said, "Comrades! You climb such big mountains to show movies to the people. The government's concern for the people is truly meticulous!" The director of the Women's Federation in Daokou, Shouguang County, saw that our clothes were dirty and led many women to compete to wash our clothes for us. When we left, the masses surrounded us, asking questions and reluctant to part. The people's love for us constantly inspires us and strengthens our determination to serve the people. In the mountainous areas where mountains stand tall and the roads are narrow and rugged, we use livestock to carry and push small carts. On the muddy river beaches, we pull the tow ropes. In this way, we overcame many difficulties and screened movies for the masses.

### 我们在农村放映电影

    我们在农村放映电影
    我队在一九五○年十二月成立，截至今年八月，在这一年零八个月中，先后带影片“钢铁战士”“中国人民的胜利”“翠岗红旗”“白毛女”“儿女亲事”“陕北牧歌”“斯大林格勒大血战”等四十余部影片，走遍了山东省的十一个专区，放映了一千六百三十九场，使一千二百二十六万六千多人看到了人民电影，受到了教育。我们在益都县七区时，有一个志愿军军属老大娘看了“钢铁战士”，深受感动，她说：“我回去一定给俺孩子写信，叫他在朝鲜狠狠地打美国鬼子！”我们在即墨付家屯放映“中国人民的胜利”时，妇女们正忙着做军鞋。她们看到影片中战士们艰苦行军的情形，说：“我们保证把军鞋做得结结实实，让战士穿着可脚，这样才对得起解放军，对得起咱毛主席呀！”每当毛主席在幕上出现时，群众便鼓掌欢呼“毛主席万岁！”他们说：“要不是毛主席，咱那能翻这样透的身。”
    电影队到处受欢迎，群众随着电影队的到来沸腾起来了。益都马庄一个老大娘说：“同志呀！你们爬这么大的山给老百姓放电影，政府对老百姓的关心真是无微不至呀！”寿光县道口的妇女会主任，见我们衣服脏了，领着很多妇女争着给我们洗衣裳。当我们走时，群众都围着我们问长问短，依依不舍。群众对我们的热爱，时刻鼓舞着我们，更加坚定了我们为人民服务的决心，我们在群山矗立的山区，道路狭窄崎岖，我们就用牲口驮、小车子推。在泥泞的河滩上我们拉着纤绳。就这样，我们克服了许多困难，给群众放映了电影。
