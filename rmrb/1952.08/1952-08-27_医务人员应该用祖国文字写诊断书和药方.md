    Medical Personnel Should Use the National Language to Write Prescriptions and Diagnoses

    I.
    Many Western-style doctors in Shanghai still write prescriptions in foreign languages. This is not only a manifestation of disrespect for the national language, but also causes great inconvenience to the majority of patients. I suggest that the local health authorities correct this situation.

    II.
    In Tangshan, private clinics have generally switched to using Chinese for prescriptions and medical records, but some doctors in public hospitals still use foreign languages when speaking, writing prescriptions, and recording medical records. I hope the Tangshan Health Bureau pays attention to this issue.

    Editor's Note: The practice of medical personnel using foreign languages instead of the national language when writing diagnoses and prescriptions is a residual manifestation of colonial habits. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, Article 19 of the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Hospitals and Clinics," promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government on March 15, 1951, clearly stipulates: Except for ethnic minorities who may use their own ethnic languages, all other "various registers, medical record forms, prescription slips, various examination forms, record forms, and various diagnosis reports, certificates, and reports of hospitals and clinics must all use Chinese." Only "before the unified names of diseases or medicines are promulgated" may "foreign language names be appended after the Chinese names." Local health administrative agencies should educate and supervise all public and private medical institutions to earnestly implement this regulation.

    Prevent Waste After a Good Harvest in Rural Areas

    Jianhu County in northern Jiangsu Province has had a bumper early rice harvest this year, which has led to wastefulness among some cadres and the masses. In Xinjian Township, villagers in Yincheng Village, led by village cadres, held "seedling addition meetings," wasting more than 600,000 yuan. They also said, "This year is a good harvest, spending a little money doesn't matter!" In Zuoyou Township, Zhao Tongxu spent 350,000 yuan to stage a Buddhist ritual; in Manan Village, Zhu Yuanqing held a Taoist ceremony during the busy farming season. In addition, it is also common to hold lavish banquets for weddings and birthdays.

    This practice not only wastes money, but also directly affects current production at a time when it is busy farming. This is a problem that deserves attention. Most parts of the country have had good harvests this year. It is hoped that local people's governments will pay attention to this issue, educate farmers to invest their surplus money in production, and promptly correct the wastage that has already occurred in some areas; areas where wastage has not yet occurred should also pay attention to prevention.

    Suggestion to Publish Large Numbers of Popular Readings and Comic Books Promoting Agricultural Mutual Aid and Cooperation

    Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, most farmers have already organized themselves. However, in the new areas, some farmers still lack understanding of the benefits of "organization" and the beautiful prospects of agricultural collectivization. They still mistakenly hope to embark on the road of rich peasant economy. Therefore, I suggest that publishing houses compile and print large numbers of popular books and comic books about the happy lives of famous model mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and Soviet collective farmers, and widely publicize them to farmers in order to strengthen the education of farmers' collectivist thinking.

### 医务人员应该用祖国文字写诊断书和药方

专栏：来信摘要

    医务人员应该用祖国文字写诊断书和药方
    一
    上海市很多西医至今还用外国文字开药方。这不仅是轻视祖国文字的表现，也使广大病人很感不便。我建议当地卫生行政机关纠正这种情况。
    傅微波
    二
    唐山市各私营诊所在处方和病历记录上一般都已改用中文，但公立医院某些医生在讲话、写处方、记录病历时却仍然沿用着外国语文，我希望唐山市卫生局注意这个问题。
    唐山市人民医院  绿原
    编者按：医务工作者在写诊断书和处方时以外国文字代替祖国文字，是殖民地社会习气的一种残余表现。为了肃清这种现象，中央人民政府卫生部在一九五一年三月十五日公布执行的“医院诊所管理暂行条例”第十九条曾明确规定：除少数民族得使用其本民族文字外，其他一切“医院诊所之各种登记簿、病历表、药方笺、各种检查单、记录表及各种诊断书、证明书、报告书等，必须一律使用中文”，只有“在病名或药名之统一名词未颁布前”，才“得在中文名词后附注外文名词”。各地卫生行政机构应教育并督促各公私医疗机构切实执行这个规定。
    防止农村丰收后的浪费现象
    苏北建湖县今年早稻丰收，在有些干部和群众中产生了浪费现象。新建乡尹成村群众在村干部带动下做加苗会，浪费了六十多万元；他们还说：“今年丰收，化几个钱不算什么！”左右乡赵同叙化了三十五万元放一台焰口；马南村朱元青在农忙时还做大仙会。此外，结婚、做生日大摆酒席的情况也很普遍。
    目前正值农忙时间，这种做法不但浪费金钱，还直接影响了当前的生产。这是一个值得重视的问题。今年全国大部地区都是丰收，希望各地人民政府注意这个问题，教育农民把余钱投入生产，对已经发生了浪费现象的地区，必须及时纠正；未发生的地区，亦应注意防止。
    李德坚
    建议大量出版宣传农业互助合作的通俗读物和连环画
    在党和人民政府的领导下，大多数农民们都已经组织起来了。但是，在新区还有一些农民对“组织起来”的好处和农业集体化的美好远景缺乏认识。他们仍然错误地希望走上富农经济的道路。因此，我建议出版机关大量编印全国著名模范互助组、农业生产合作社以及苏联集体农民幸福生活的通俗书籍和连环画，广泛向农民宣传，以便加强农民集体主义思想的教育。苏金铭
