    岚生's Self-Criticism on Reflecting Inaccurate Information
    The article "Suggestion to Inspect the Implementation of the Marriage Law in Gaomi Dian Village," published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on July 17, was written by me. Some of the situations and facts in the article are not accurate. First, the bride price accepted by Wang Wenxi was 1.2 million yuan, not 1.5 million yuan. Wang Wenxi's daughter is twenty-five years old, and the man is thirty-three years old. Their marriage age does not violate the Marriage Law, and both parties agreed to the marriage. Second, regarding Village Chief Wang Tingxiang's attitude towards his wife, I only looked at the phenomenon without making an essential understanding. In fact, there is no feudal-era issue of men abusing women involved. I should thoroughly examine myself for reporting inaccurate information to the Party newspaper. After hearing some feedback from the masses, I did not conduct actual in-depth investigation and analysis, but blindly and one-sidedly reported some hearsay materials and superficial phenomena to the Party newspaper. This is a concrete manifestation of my irresponsibility to the people. In the future, when writing reports, I must ensure that the reports are completely consistent with the facts. 岚生

    岚生对反映情况失实的检讨
    七月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的“建议检查高米店村执行婚姻法的情况”一文，是我写的。文中有一些情况和事实不符合。一、王文喜接受的彩礼是一百二十万元，并不是一百五十万元。王文喜的女儿二十五岁，男方三十三岁，他俩结婚年龄是不违背婚姻法的，并且双方都同意结婚。二、关于村长王廷祥对待老婆的态度，我只从现象上看，没有作本质的了解。其实这当中没有封建性质的男人虐待女人的问题。我向党报反映不符合事实的情况，应该很好地检讨。我听到一些群众的反映后，没有作实际的深入的调查、分析，只是盲目地、片面地向党报反映了一些道听途说的材料和表面的现象，这是我对人民不负责任的具体表现。今后写报道时，我一定要使报道完全符合事实。  岚生
