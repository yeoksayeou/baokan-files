    In Memory of Martyr Yang Liandi
    Ministry of Railways Adopts This Newspaper's Readers' Suggestion
    To Name the Eighth Bridge "Yang Liandi Bridge"
    After the news of "Climbing Hero" Yang Liandi's heroic sacrifice on the Korean front was published, many readers wrote to express their grief and respect for Martyr Yang Liandi's heroic deeds during his lifetime. Readers You Baocheng, Li Dayou, and five others jointly wrote: "We once traveled by train on the Longhai Railway and admired the magnificence of the restored Eighth Bridge. Martyr Yang Liandi's heroic spirit and enthusiasm for building the motherland encouraged us to keep moving forward. Martyr Yang Liandi made great contributions to the construction of the motherland; now, he has dedicated his precious life to the cause of striving for the independence and freedom of the Korean people and the peace and happiness of the people of the world. His spirit is worthy of our respect and learning." Readers Ye Shushen and two others wrote: "Martyr Yang Liandi's life is full of the brilliance of revolutionary heroism and demonstrates the noble qualities of a Bolshevik. His great patriotism and internationalism are examples for us to learn from."
    Many readers in their letters unanimously suggested that in order to commemorate Martyr Yang Liandi, the Eighth Bridge on the Longhai Railway should be named after Yang Liandi's glorious name; and a monument should be erected at the bridgehead. We believe these suggestions are very good and immediately forwarded them to the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government for consideration. Now, the Ministry of Railways has decided to adopt this suggestion and has ordered the Zhengzhou Railway Administration to implement it.

    纪念杨连第烈士
    铁道部采纳本报读者建议
    把八号桥命名为“杨连第桥”
    “登高英雄”杨连第在朝鲜前线壮烈牺牲的消息发表后，很多读者来信表示了悲痛的心情和对杨连第烈士生前英雄业迹的崇敬。读者尤宝诚、李大友等七人联名来信说：“我们曾乘火车在陇海路上奔驰，瞻仰了修复后的八号桥的雄姿。杨连第烈士的英雄气魄和建设祖国的热情，鼓舞着我们不断前进。杨连第烈士在祖国的建设中有了伟大的贡献；现在，他又在争取朝鲜人民独立自由和世界人民和平幸福的事业中献出了自己宝贵的生命。他的精神是值得我们尊敬和学习的。”读者叶树深等三人来信说：“杨连第烈士的一生，充满着革命英雄主义的光辉，表现了布尔什维克的崇高品质。他的伟大的爱国主义和国际主义精神，是我们学习的榜样。”
    很多来信的读者一致提出：为了纪念杨连第烈士，建议把陇海路上的八号桥，用杨连第这个光辉的名字来命名；并且在这个桥的桥头建立一个纪念碑。我们认为这些建议是很好的，当即转请中央人民政府铁道部考虑。现铁道部已决定采纳这个建议，并已命令郑州铁路管理局照办。
