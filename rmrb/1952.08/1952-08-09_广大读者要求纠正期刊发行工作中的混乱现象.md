    Broad Readership Demands Correction of Chaotic Phenomena in Journal Distribution Work

    This newspaper frequently receives letters from readers in various regions exposing serious chaotic phenomena in journal distribution work and criticizing the irresponsible style of distribution workers. To draw the attention of relevant authorities and resolve this issue promptly, we have compiled and published these letters as follows:

    The distribution time for many journals is excessively delayed. Readers are extremely dissatisfied with this phenomenon. Reader Shi Zhong from Nanjing writes: He subscribed to "China Youth" magazine at Xinhua Bookstore. He only received the eighth issue, published on May 3rd, on June 7th, and the ninth issue, published on May 24th, on June 17th. Readers Shan Zhong and Lao Tang from Shaoyang, Hunan, write: Many people there call journals "historical publications" because they receive them so late that some journals' guiding role is diminished. Readers Huang Xiangkun and others from Beijing point out: "It is often the case that the subscribed journals have not yet been received, while the bookstores and stalls on the street are already selling them retail. As a result, many people are unwilling to subscribe to journals anymore."

    Many readers who subscribed to journals either don't receive them or receive the wrong ones. Li Xinguo from Sanhe People's Cultural Center in Feixi County, Anhui, writes: The Cultural Center ordered magazines such as "East China Pictorial," "New China Women," and "New Sports" from Xinhua Bookstore East China General Branch on April 3rd, but had not received a single copy by June 13th. Readers Su Bin, Luo Xueren, Lei Lixing, Yang Wanbang, Mao Lin, Yu Chao, Sun Guilan, Li Jianfu, Li Tianhong, Xiao Yang, and others all express dissatisfaction because they subscribed to journals but didn't receive them. Zhao Weiqiang from the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce Library writes: "Our union subscribed to six copies of 'China Youth' at Xinhua Bookstore East China General Branch, but actually received fifty-eight copies. We immediately notified Xinhua Bookstore of this situation, but for the subsequent three issues, we still received fifty-eight copies. We wrote again to inquire, but received no reply. I suggest that Xinhua Bookstore immediately correct this chaotic phenomenon." Readers He Xibei, Zhao Ketong, and others also reported receiving too many journals. Chen Weixiang and Zhou Mingjie from the library of the Hunan Provincial People's Government Office write: Their library ordered a batch of magazines from Xinhua Bookstore Changsha Branch on April 11, 1951, including a one-year subscription to "Literary Gazette." They only received eight issues of "Literary Gazette," and then stopped receiving it. They repeatedly called and sent people to the Changsha Branch to inquire, but to no avail. They also sent six or seven letters directly to the subscription department of Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters, inquiring about this matter. The subscription department finally admitted: "Because the title column on the order form was blank, the working comrade filled in 'New Construction' at random." However, they did not admit to ever sending eight issues of "Literary Gazette." They then went to the Changsha Branch to check the order form and found that it said "Sino-Soviet Friendship." It is said that this was also because the title column on the order form was originally blank, and the person in charge filled it in at random. In fact, when their organization ordered "Literary Gazette," they also ordered "Sino-Soviet Friendship" and "New Construction," but they never received duplicate copies of these two publications. On March 4, 1952, they ordered another copy of "Literary Gazette," but still did not receive a single issue. This matter was only resolved after Comrades Chen Weixiang and Zhou Mingjie wrote a letter to the responsible comrades of Xinhua Bookstore and relevant authorities on May 16, offering strict criticism.

    Many readers who receive their ordered journals late or not at all inquire with the handling bookstores, but some bookstore staff members still fail to take responsibility to solve the problem and correct the errors. Readers are most dissatisfied with this situation. The library of Kunshan County Middle School in Southern Jiangsu writes: They remitted payment through the Kunshan People's Bank branch to Tianjin Xinhua Bookstore on April 17 to order "Historical Teaching" for half a year. Neither the publication nor the order confirmation was received. They wrote to inquire twice on May 20 and May 29, but had heard nothing by June 14. Wang Yuantang from Beijing writes: He ordered a copy of "China Youth" at Xidan United Bookstore. A long time after the tenth issue of the journal was published, he still had not received it. He called the United Bookstore to inquire, and the store said he should inquire with Xinhua Bookstore. He called Xinhua Bookstore, and the reply was: "It was sent out long ago, ask the post office!" Because the journal was not sent by registered mail, the post office could not check, so they told him to ask Xinhua Bookstore again. He made more than a dozen calls back and forth, but the problem was still not resolved. Reader Du Jinghao from Zibo Special District United Normal School in Shandong writes: The school asked Xinhua Bookstore Huantai Branch to order a copy of "World Knowledge" and five copies of "Current Affairs Handbook" from Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters on May 7, 1951. As of March 1952, they had not received a single copy. The school constantly inquired with Xinhua Bookstore Huantai Branch and Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters. Only in April 1952 did they receive a reply from Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters, admitting that they would send the missing copies. The school originally ordered five copies of "Current Affairs Handbook," but Xinhua Bookstore only sent one copy. The school wrote again to inquire, but never received a reply.

    The readers in these letters unanimously point out: The chaos in journal distribution work has seriously affected their studies and work. They believe that the fact that some distribution workers are still so irresponsible after the "Three-Anti" Movement is intolerable and must be resolutely corrected.

### 广大读者要求纠正期刊发行工作中的混乱现象

专栏：读者来信综述

    广大读者要求纠正期刊发行工作中的混乱现象
    本报经常收到各地读者揭发期刊发行工作中的严重混乱现象和批评发行工作人员不负责任的作风的来信。为了引起有关机关的重视，以便早日解决这个问题，特将这些来信综合发表如下：
    许多期刊的发行时间过于迟缓。读者对于这种现象极为不满。南京读者施中来信说：他在新华书店订阅了“中国青年”杂志。他在六月七日才收到五月三日出版的第八期，在六月十七日才收到五月二十四日出版的第九期。湖南邵阳读者山中、老堂来信说：他们那里有很多人都把期刊叫做“历史刊”。因为收到期刊的时间过晚，有些期刊就减弱了指导作用。北京读者黄祥坤等指出：“经常是这样情况：订阅的期刊还没收到，街头的书店、书摊早已零售了。这样，很多人就不愿再订阅期刊了。”
    许多读者订了期刊，有的收不到，有的收错了。安徽肥西县三河人民文化馆李新国来信说：文化馆在四月三日向新华书店华东总分店订购了“华东画报”、“新中国妇女”、“新体育”等杂志，到了六月十三日，还没有收到过一份。读者苏斌、罗学仁、雷力行、杨万邦、茂林、俞超、孙桂兰、李健夫、李天宏、小杨等的来信，都因订了期刊而收不到表示不满。上海工商联图书馆赵伟强来信说：“我们工会在新华书店华东总分店订阅了六份‘中国青年’，实际上收到了五十八份。我们立即把这种情况通知新华书店，但以后的三期还是收到五十八份。我们再去信询问，但未见复信。我建议新华书店立即纠正这种混乱现象。”读者何西北、赵克同等也反映了多收到期刊的情况。湖南省人民政府办公厅图书室陈为湘、周明杰来信说：他们的图书室在一九五一年四月十一日向新华书店长沙分店订了一批杂志，其中有一份“文艺报”，订期一年。他们只收到八期“文艺报”，以后就收不到了。他们一再打电话，并派人到长沙分店查询，毫无结果。他们又直接给新华书店总店订阅科寄了六、七次信，询问这件事情。订阅科最后才承认：“因为订单上刊名栏是空白，工作同志随便填上了‘新建设’。”但并不承认曾经寄过八期“文艺报”，他们再到长沙分店去查订单，发现订单上写的是“中苏友好”。据说也是因为订单上的刊名栏原是空白的，经办人随便填上了。其实他们机关在订“文艺报”的时候，也订了“中苏友好”和“新建设”，但这两种刊物，从来没有收到过双份。一九五二年三月四日，他们又订了一份“文艺报”，结果还是一期也没有收到。这件事直到陈为湘、周明杰两同志在五月十六日写信给新华书店负责同志及各有关机关提出严格批评后，才解决了。
    很多读者收晚了或收不到订购的期刊，向经办书店查询，有些书店工作人员仍然不负责任去解决问题，改正错误。读者对于这种情况最不满意。苏南昆山县中学图书室来信说：他们在四月十七日由昆山人民银行支行汇款向天津市新华书店订了“历史教学”，为期半年。既不见刊物，也不见订单。他们曾在五月二十日和五月二十九日两次去信查询，直到六月十四日还没有音讯。北京王元堂来信说：他在西单联营书店订了一份“中国青年”，该刊第十期出版很久以后，他还没有收到。他打电话到联营书店查询，该店说应向新华书店查询。他打电话给新华书店，答复是：“早寄出了，你问邮局吧！”由于期刊不是挂号邮寄，邮局无法查对，又让他问新华书店。他来回打了十几次电话，问题还是没有解决。山东淄博专区联立师范学校读者杜景浩来信说：该校在一九五一年五月七日，请新华书店桓台支店向新华书店总店代订了一份“世界知识”，五份“时事手册”，直到一九五二年三月，还没收到一本。该校曾不断向新华书店桓台支店和新华书店总店查询，到一九五二年四月才得到新华书店总店答复，承认给该校补寄。该校原订了五份“时事手册”，新华书店只补寄一份。该校又去信查询，一直没有答复。
    这些来信的读者一致指出：期刊发行工作的混乱，已经严重地影响了他们的学习和工作。他们认为：在“三反”运动以后，某些发行工作者还这样不负责任，这是不能容忍的，必须坚决加以纠正。
