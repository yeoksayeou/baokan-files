Bring Scientific and Technical Knowledge to the Masses
    -- On the Second Anniversary of the Founding of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization
    Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization

The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates an important task for scientific workers across the country: to popularize scientific knowledge among the people. The All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization was established two years ago today under this solemn call. The Association has defined its task: to organize members to publicize natural science knowledge and bring science and technology to the masses.

Over the past two years, the Association has been growing. Currently, the Association's branches are distributed in twenty-nine provinces and cities across the country, and twenty-two sub-associations have been established in counties and cities under the jurisdiction of each province. Famous scientists, technical experts, teachers, medical workers, engineers, and agricultural and forestry scientists have voluntarily joined the ranks of the Association, undertaking the glorious task of popularizing scientific knowledge. Moreover, those participating in the work of the Association include not only urban and rural intellectuals but also labor models from production posts, such as Qiu Guanxing, the model in Zhejiang Province for controlling rice borers, and Lu Agou, the famous industrial labor model in Shanghai. Under the organization of the Association, they have given lectures to the masses about their own production experiences. Because they possess rich practical knowledge and a high degree of prestige among the masses, their science popularization work often achieves significant results.

Currently, the Association has more than thirteen thousand members.

The enthusiasm of the members for the people's science popularization cause is an important condition for the development of the Association's work; but only under the leadership of the people's political power can scientific workers have the possibility of popularizing scientific and technical knowledge among the broad masses of working people.

Popularizing scientific knowledge means using science and technology to arm the minds of the liberated workers and peasants, enabling them to exert greater strength in our country's economic construction; popularizing scientific knowledge also means fighting against superstition, backwardness, and all reactionary ideas that violate science, and helping the people establish a correct communist worldview. Over the past two years, the Association has begun to move towards this great goal.

In two years, the Association's branches in various regions have held more than eleven thousand two hundred scientific lectures, screened more than four thousand five hundred scientific slide shows, and organized nearly four hundred scientific exhibitions, benefiting a total of more than seven million five hundred thousand people.

The Association has held systematic technical lectures for workers. For example, the machine manufacturing lectures and electrical engineering lectures held by the Zhejiang Provincial Branch were always packed with audiences. The workers promised to thank the lecturers' enthusiasm by increasing production. With the development of the increase production and practice economy campaign in various regions, the dissemination of advanced production experience has begun to become one of the main projects of the Association's work. The branches in various regions have publicized "high-speed metal cutting methods," "the 1951 weaving method," and "nodular cast iron." Many spare-time schools in cities have also been arranged by the Association to hold regular scientific lectures.

The Association uses small mobile exhibitions and slide shows to carry out rural work, and lectures are also held in some rural areas. Farmers warmly welcome the publicity of production knowledge such as "crop pests and diseases" and "pig raising and manure accumulation." The experience of high yields of various crops has also become a major publicity theme in rural areas.

Regardless of cities and villages, the masses have shown great interest in astronomical knowledge. The Association has held small astronomical knowledge exhibitions in various places, and through lectures on topics such as "the movement of celestial bodies" and "the origin of the earth," it has carried out the propaganda of the materialist worldview to the masses.

The Association attaches great importance to the publicity of the achievements of New China's construction. In the past six months, under the general topic of "Achievements of Science and Construction in New China," it has publicized "the Great Huai River Project," "the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway," "the achievements of industrial and agricultural construction in New China," and "the new discoveries of underground treasures in the motherland," totaling more than seven hundred lectures.

In order to cooperate with the patriotic health campaign carried out across the country this summer, the Association organized branches in various regions to carry out publicity campaigns on cleanliness, hygiene, epidemic prevention, and anti-bacterial warfare. In the three months of April, May, and June, it carried out approximately six thousand lectures. In Shanghai alone, the audience educated by the Association reached more than one million people.

In terms of publishing work, the Association has published more than one hundred and twenty kinds of pamphlets, with a circulation of more than four hundred thousand copies, and produced more than one hundred and fifty kinds of slides.

The Association's work over the past two years has achieved preliminary results and effects.

The Association's experience over the past two years proves that as long as the enthusiasm of the members is continuously brought into play and improved, the extensive development of science popularization work is highly possible. The Association once stipulated that each member must participate in two science popularization activities (such as lectures or writing articles) each year. The reason why this goal cannot be achieved is due to the weakness of the Association's organizational strength, not because the members lack enthusiasm. As everyone knows, scientific and technical workers have recently proposed to "connect with workers and peasants" and "integrate with reality" in the ideological remolding movement, and science popularization work can precisely be established on the bridge of this connection or integration. Many scientific workers have connected with the masses through science popularization work and have been warmly welcomed by the masses; at the same time, they have also obtained the opportunity to truly contact reality in science popularization work, because some problems in the actual production and life of workers and peasants can indeed enlighten scientific workers and help them to face reality in scientific research, scientific education, and scientific administration. Therefore, if we can fully estimate the enthusiasm of scientific workers, if we can absorb a large number of scientific and technical workers and social and cultural workers into the Association as members, and organize the activists among them into the leadership organizations at all levels of the Association, the Association's work will achieve greater success.

The experience of the past two years has also proved that combining the central tasks of the state and local areas to carry out science popularization work is the main method for the Association's work to obtain support from all parties and produce practical results. The increase production and practice economy campaign is one of the central tasks of the people of the whole country. The Association must vigorously disseminate advanced production experiences in industry and agriculture, scientific and technical knowledge of production, and scientific research results closely related to production and construction. In addition, in order to cooperate with the patriotic health campaign, the Association must continue to regularly publicize common knowledge of cleanliness and hygiene, and must focus on publicizing knowledge of maternal and child health in rural areas and small cities. In order to cooperate with the current communist education for cadres at all levels in various regions, the Association must publicize the great communist construction of the Soviet Union, publicize the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union applied in socialist production, popularize the achievements of modern advanced natural science from which scientific materialism has grown, and explain natural phenomena from a materialist point of view.

The experience of the past two years has also proved that work must continue to penetrate into the masses, take root in the masses, and gradually regularize the work in order to exert the positive effectiveness of the work and gradually improve its quality and ideological level. All raid-like, intermittent work must be turned into a regularized path. The Association's work must often meet with the masses, listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses, so that the Association can have an inseparable relationship with the masses, and ensure the improvement of the quality of work.

Finally, the experience of the past two years has proved that the care and guidance of the Party and the People's Government, and the cooperation and assistance of relevant agencies and other people's organizations, are important guarantees for the development and consolidation of the Association's work. In the future, we must strengthen contacts with relevant departments, and under the unified leadership of the Party and the People's Government, closely cooperate with trade unions, the Communist Youth League, social and cultural agencies, and other relevant agencies and organizations to develop our science popularization cause.

Science popularization work is an important link in ideological work, and it should play its important supporting role in the upsurge of national economic construction and the struggle for a socialist future.

Let scientific and technical workers and social and cultural workers across the country unite more closely, organize themselves, and popularize scientific and technical knowledge to the masses more widely and deeply!

    把科学技术知识带到群众中去
    ——为中华全国科学技术普及协会成立两周年而作
    中华全国科学技术普及协会主席　梁希
    人民政协共同纲领给全国的科学工作者规定了一项重要任务：要向人民群众普及科学知识。中华全国科学技术普及协会就是在两年前的今天，在这个庄严的号召下成立起来的。协会规定了自己的任务：要组织会员进行自然科学知识的宣传，把科学技术带到群众中去。
    两年来，协会在不断地壮大。现在，协会的分会已经分布在全国二十九个省、市，在各个省辖的县市中也已建立了二十二个支会。著名的科学家、技术专家、教师、医务工作者、工程师、农林学家都自愿地参加到协会的行列中来，担负起普及科学知识的光荣任务。而且，参加了协会工作的，不仅是城乡的知识分子，还有生产岗位上的劳动模范，像浙江省的治螟模范邱关兴，上海市的著名工业劳动模范陆阿狗，都曾在协会的组织下向群众讲演他们自己的生产经验，由于他们具有丰富的实际知识和在群众中的高度威信，他们的科学宣传工作常常获得显著的效果。
    现在，协会已有了一万三千多个会员。
    会员对于人民的科学普及事业的热忱，是协会工作得以开展的重要条件；但只有在人民政权的领导下，科学工作者才有向广大劳动人民普及科学技术知识的可能性。
    普及科学知识，就是用科学和技术去武装解放了的工农群众的头脑，使他们在我国的经济建设中能发挥更大的力量；普及科学知识，也即是向迷信、落后和一切违反科学的反动思想进行斗争，帮助人民建立起正确的共产主义的世界观来。协会两年来，开始朝着这伟大的目标前进。
    两年中，协会各地分会一共举办了一万一千二百余次科学讲演，放映了四千五百余次科学内容的幻灯片，并组织了近四百次的科学展览，全部的受益人数达到七百五十余万人。
    协会为工人们举办了系统的技术讲座，像浙江省分会所办的机器制造讲座和电机讲座，每次听众都是满座，工人们保证以提高生产来感谢讲员们的热情。随着各地增产节约运动的开展，先进生产经验的传播已开始成为协会工作的主要项目之一，各地分会宣传了“金属高速切削法”，“一九五一织布工作法”，“球墨铸铁”等。城市中的很多业余学校也由协会安排了经常性的科学讲座。
    协会用小型巡回展览和幻灯放映的方式去进行农村工作，在有些农村也举办讲演。农民们热烈欢迎“庄稼病虫害”、“养猪积肥”等生产知识的宣传。各种作物的丰产经验也成为农村中主要的宣传主题。
    不论城市和农村，群众对于天文知识表现了极大的兴趣；协会在各地举办了小型的天文知识展览，通过“天体的运行”、“地球的起源”等主题的讲演，向群众进行唯物世界观的宣传。
    协会对于新中国建设的成就的宣传给以很大的重视。最近半年来，在“新中国的科学与建设的成就”的总题下，宣传了“伟大的治淮工程”、“成渝铁路”、“新中国工业、农业建设的成就”、“祖国地下宝藏的新发现”等，总共进行了七百余次讲演。
    为配合今夏在全国开展的爱国卫生运动，协会组织了各地分会开展清洁卫生、防疫反细菌战的宣传运动，在四、五、六三个月中进行了约六千次的讲演，单是上海一市，受到协会宣传教育的听众就达到一百余万人。
    在出版工作方面，协会出版了小册子一百二十余种，发行四十余万册，制作了幻灯片一百五十余种。
    两年来协会的工作是有初步成绩和效果的。
    协会两年来的工作经验证明：只要不断地发挥并提高会员的积极性，科学普及工作的广泛展开便有极大的可能。协会曾经规定：每个会员每年必须参加两次科学普及工作（如讲演或写稿），这个目的所以不能达到，是由于目前协会组织力量的薄弱，而不是由于会员的没有积极性。大家知道，科学技术工作者在最近的思想改造运动中都提出要“联系工农”、“结合实际”，而科学普及工作恰恰可以建立在这一联系或结合的桥梁上。很多科学工作者，通过科学普及工作联系了群众，受到群众热烈的欢迎；同时，在科学普及工作中又得到了真正接触实际的机会，因为，工农群众在实际生产和生活中的一些问题，的确可以启发科学工作者，帮助他们在科学研究、科学教育、科学行政工作中面向实际。因此，我们如果能够充分估计科学工作者的积极性，如果能够在工作中大量吸收科学技术工作者和社会文教工作者为会员，把他们中间的积极分子组织到协会各级领导组织中来，协会的工作将会有更大的成就。
    两年来的经验又证明：结合国家的和地方的中心任务来进行科学普及工作，是使协会工作获得各方面支持并产生实际效果的主要方法。增产节约运动是当前全国人民的中心任务之一，协会必须大力传播工农业先进生产经验、科学的生产技术知识以及和生产建设有密切关系的科学研究成果。此外，为配合爱国卫生运动，协会必须继续经常地宣传清洁卫生常识，更必须在农村和小城市中着重宣传妇幼卫生知识。为配合各地区目前正在进行的对各级干部的共产主义教育，协会必须宣传苏联伟大的共产主义建设，宣传苏联应用在社会主义生产中的先进科学技术，普及科学的唯物主义所由成长起来的现代的先进自然科学的成就，并以唯物主义的观点解释自然现象。
    两年来的经验又证明：必须使工作继续深入到群众中去，在群众中生根，并使工作逐渐地经常化，才可能发挥工作的积极效能，并逐步提高其质量和思想水平。一切突击性的间歇性的工作必须转到经常化的道路上去，要使协会的工作经常和群众见面，要听取群众的意见和批评，这样，才能使协会和群众有着不可分割的关系，才能保证提高工作的质量。
    最后，两年来的经验证明，党和人民政府的关怀与指导，有关机关和其他人民团体的合作与协助，是协会工作赖以发展和巩固的重要保证。今后我们必须加强与有关部门的联系，在党和人民政府的统一领导下，和工会、青年团、社会文化机关及其他有关机关团体紧密合作，发展我们的科学普及事业。
    科学普及工作是思想工作的重要一环，在祖国经济建设高潮及为争取社会主义前途而进行的斗争中，它应该起它重要的配合作用。
    全国科学技术工作者、社会文教工作者更紧密地团结起来，组织起来，更广泛更深入地普及科学技术知识到群众中去！
