Xinhua News Agency, August 26th. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued a "Notice on Launching an Autumn Crop Bumper Harvest Appraisal Campaign," calling on all regions to earnestly launch bumper harvest appraisal campaigns for various major autumn crops (such as rice, cotton, millet, soybeans, and sweet potatoes). The notice stated: All regions should list the autumn bumper harvest appraisal campaign as the central task for leading autumn agricultural production, and all other production work should be carried out in conjunction with this central task. People's governments at all levels from the province down to the township should be led by responsible cadres to establish bumper harvest appraisal committees, or under the leadership of the production and drought prevention office, to mobilize farmers in an organized and planned manner. On the basis of bumper harvests, they should conduct comparisons of patriotism, mutual assistance, crops, technology, and harvest, and appraise various bumper harvest households, bumper harvest groups, and various levels of bumper harvest models from bottom to top, level by level, to further launch the patriotic production increase competition. At the same time, this year's selection of fine varieties of autumn grain crops should not be regarded as two separate tasks from the bumper harvest appraisal and arranged separately. In counties that select fine varieties, outstanding varieties should be compared level by level through comparisons of crops, harvests, and technology, and county preliminary selection seeds should be produced. All regions should widely carry out field ear selection in conjunction with bumper harvest appraisals, calling on every farmer to select enough seeds for their seed fields for each crop, and the practice of emphasizing quantity over quality and using plot selection to remove impurities and inferiorities instead of ear selection must be corrected. For cotton, every household should select seeds from relatively high-yielding fields for self-retention, and villages with high-yielding fields should retain all high-yielding fields for seed and organize exchanges. Regarding bumper harvest experiences, all regions should mobilize cadres from state-owned farms to summarize several outstanding bumper harvest experiences completely and conscientiously, based on various crops and types, in conjunction with the bumper harvest appraisal. It is necessary to analyze and study them based on scientific theories, experimental results, and in connection with the local environment, and summarize successful experiences and lessons learned; it is necessary to analyze the reasons for obtaining bumper harvests based on historical, political, and economic conditions. Change the past method of recording-style summaries. Not only is it necessary to summarize the experience of new records of high yields, but also to pay more attention to the experience of widespread bumper harvests over large areas.

    中央人民政府农业部发出通知
    号召开展秋季作物丰产评比运动
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民政府农业部发出“关于开展秋季作物丰产评比运动的通知”，号召各地认真开展各种主要秋季作物（如水稻、棉花、小米、大豆、甘薯）的丰产评比运动。通知中说：各地应将秋季丰产评比运动列为领导秋季农业生产的中心工作，其他生产工作均结合这一中心工作进行。从省以下到乡各级人民政府，均应由负责干部掌握成立丰产评比委员会，或在生产防旱办公室领导下，有组织有计划地发动农民，在丰产基础上开展比爱国、比互助、比庄稼、比技术、比收成，自下而上逐级评比出各种丰产户、丰产组和各级各种丰产模范，以进一步开展爱国增产竞赛。同时，今年秋季粮食作物评选良种，不应当和丰产评比看作两件工作，分开布置。在良种评选县应通过比庄稼、比收成、比技术，把优良品种逐级比出来，产生县初选种。各地都应结合丰产评比广泛开展田间穗选，号召每户农民穗选每种作物够种子田用的种子，必须纠正重量不重质和用片选块选去杂去劣代替穗选的办法。棉花要家家在比较丰产的田里选种自留，有丰产田的村把丰产田全部留种，组织互换。关于丰产经验，各地应发动国营农场干部，结合丰产评比，分别各种作物，各个类型，完整地、认真地总结出几个突出的丰产经验来。要根据科学理论、试验结果、并联系当地环境加以分析研究，总结出成功经验和失败教训；要根据历史和政治、经济条件，分析其获得丰产的原因。改变过去记录式的总结办法。不仅需要总结高额产量新记录的经验，更应重视大面积普遍丰产的经验。
