    Health Worker Lu Yanming Suggests Improving Methods for Handling Feces
    Editor: I am a staff member of the Southern Anhui Medical and Health Brigade. In my work, I feel that the methods for handling feces in various places need to be greatly improved. Feces are a breeding ground for infectious diseases (such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, schistosomiasis, etc.) and a major fertilizer in agricultural production. The patriotic health campaign must not be divorced from increasing production and practicing economy. When handling feces, we must adhere to the principle of "spend less money, do more things, popularize first, improve later," so that we both eliminate germs and parasites, and preserve the fertilizer value of the feces as much as possible.
    To handle feces well, we must first start by improving toilets. The various germs contained in feces are transmitted through flies, etc. Feces jars and pits easily attract flies, but as long as they are covered with something, flies cannot fly in. The covers for feces jars and pits do not necessarily have to be wooden; covers made of thatch, sorghum stalks, or vitex can be used. If maggots grow in the feces pit or jar, some crushed soil or boiling water can be put in to kill the maggots. But lime and firewood ash should not be used, because that easily causes the nitrogen in the feces to volatilize, reducing the fertilizer effect. Some toilets do not have feces jars or pits, making it difficult to cover them tightly. It is best to renovate them. If renovation is not possible for the time being, piles of crushed soil can be placed next to the squatting position, and the feces can be covered with crushed soil after defecation.
    Fresh feces contain many germs. Using this kind of feces to fertilize fields can spread diseases, harm human health, and burn crops to death. Therefore, fresh feces must be stored for more than half a month and fermented before use. After feces ferment and undergo chemical changes, germs die, insect eggs are destroyed, and the harm to people is reduced. Organic matter becomes a stable compound, and at the same time, some nitrogen can be fixed or absorbed, increasing the value of the fertilizer. Lu Yanming

    卫生工作者卢彦明建议改进处理粪便的方法
    编辑同志：我是皖南医疗卫生大队的工作人员，我在工作中感到各地对于粪便的处理方法需要很好地加以改进。粪便是传染病的老窝（如霍乱、痢疾、伤寒、吸血虫等），又是农业生产中的主要肥料。开展爱国卫生运动决不能和增产节约脱节。处理粪便时，一定要掌握“少化钱，多做事，先普及，后提高”的原则，既要消灭病菌和寄生虫，又要尽量保持粪便的肥料价值。
    要把粪便处理好，必须先从改善厕所方面着手。粪便里含着的各种病菌，是经过苍蝇等物传染的。粪缸、粪坑容易招引苍蝇，但是，只要用东西把它盖起来，苍蝇就不能飞入了。粪缸、粪坑的盖不一定要用木盖，用茅草、高粱秸、荆条等编成的盖都可以。如果粪坑粪缸生了蛆，可放进一些碎土或开水把蛆杀死。但不能用石灰和柴草灰，因为那样容易使粪内氮素挥发，减去肥料效力。有的厕所没有粪缸、粪坑，很难用什么东西盖严，最好是加以改造。如一时不能改造，可在蹲位旁边堆些碎土，大便后用碎土把粪便盖住。
    新鲜大便里面含有很多病菌，用这种粪便肥田，可能传染疾病，危害人类的身体健康；而且还会把庄稼烧坏烧死。因此，新鲜粪便一定要贮存半月以上，经过发酵才能用。粪便发酵，经过化学变化以后，病菌死亡，虫卵破坏，就减去了对人的危害性。有机物变为稳定性化合物，同时也可固定或吸收部分氮素，增加了肥料的价值。卢彦明
