In order to increase the unit area yield of farmland and complete this year's patriotic production increase task, half of the counties in Hubei Province have successively launched large-scale manure accumulation campaigns. The amount of fertilizer in these areas quickly increased by one-third, solving the problem of fertilizer shortage for farmers (especially poor and hired peasants and the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers), and enhancing farmers' confidence in patriotic production increase. This campaign was launched in conjunction with the patriotic health campaign. Farmers carried out a major clean-up from inside the house to outside, from the patio to the gutter, and from the streets to the alleys.

This campaign was first launched in the Huanggang Special District. At the beginning of the spring plowing season, the Huanggang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Production Office, in response to the widespread shortage of fertilizer in various counties, called on all counties under its jurisdiction to seize the opportunity, mobilize every household, and get everyone involved in carrying out a large-scale mass manure accumulation campaign under leadership, and to make this campaign an important item in the production increase competition. The counties fully mobilized the masses and launched competitions with mutual aid teams as the core. The campaign quickly spread throughout the province.

In the manure accumulation campaign, mutual aid teams played a major role. The Xie Kaishan mutual aid team in Xishui County took the lead in challenging the entire county, and the Xu Dingxue and other mutual aid teams took the lead in responding to the challenge, quickly spreading the campaign throughout the county. Under the influence of the Xu Dingxue mutual aid team, Sha帽xiang once again completed its plan to increase fertilizer accumulation by 150,000 dan. The entire county increased fertilizer accumulation by 15 million dan in late May. The Peng Sihan mutual aid team in Zhongyi District of Macheng applied 80 percent more fertilizer this year than last year. Their actions became a model for the local peasants to learn from.

In this campaign, leading cadres at all county and district levels went deep among the masses, provided specific guidance, and established deep feelings with the masses. Bai Shuitian, the county head of Xishui County, and Qiao Ping, the deputy county head, led more than 4,000 cadres, workers, and shop assistants from the government offices to help farmers deliver manure with great enthusiasm, delivering a total of 268,557 dan of city manure to the countryside. Zhou Zhiduan, the secretary of the Qichun County Party Committee, He Qi, the county head, and Li Ziming, the deputy county head, led more than 1,600 cadres and citizens from government offices to help farmers deliver 536,000 dan of manure. Leading comrades in most counties and districts throughout the province took the lead in participating in this campaign, greatly inspiring the production enthusiasm of the masses.

At the end of the manure accumulation campaign, mass appraisals and summaries were conducted in various places, and plans for the next stage were put forward. With more fertilizer, the masses' confidence in increasing production has become more solid and full.

    湖北半数县份开展大规模的积肥运动
    为了提高农田单位面积产量，完成今年的爱国增产任务，湖北省有二分之一的县份相继开展了大规模的积肥运动。这些地区的肥料很快增加了三分之一，解决了农民（特别是贫雇农和烈属军属）缺少肥料的问题，提高了农民爱国增产的信心。这个运动是结合爱国卫生运动开展起来的。农民们从屋内到屋外，从天井到阴沟，从街头到巷尾，进行了一次大扫除。
    这个运动是在黄冈专区首先开展起来的。春耕开始时，黄冈专署生产办公室针对各县普遍缺少肥料的情况，号召所属各县，抓紧时机，实行户户动员，人人动手，开展一个有领导的大规模的群众性的积肥运动，并把这个运动作为增产竞赛运动中的一个重要的评比项目。各县充分发动群众，以互助组为核心，展开了竞赛。运动很快普及到全省。
    在积肥运动中，互助组发挥了很大的作用。浠水谢开善互助组首先向全县挑战，徐定学等互助组带头应战，使运动很快遍及全县。纱帽乡在徐定学互助组的影响下，再一次完成了增积肥料十五万担的计划。全县在五月下旬增积肥料一千五百万担。麻城中驿区彭思汉互助组今年施用的肥料，比去年增加了百分之八十。他们的行动成为当地农民群众学习的榜样。
    在这次运动中，各县区的领导干部，深入群众，具体领导，和群众建立了深厚的感情。浠水县县长白水田、副县长乔平带领机关干部、工人、店员共四千多人，以无比的热情，帮助农民送粪，共计送城粪二十六万八千五百五十七担下乡。中共蕲春县委书记周之端、县长何启、副县长李子明等带领机关干部、市民等一千六百多人，帮助农民送粪五十三万六千担。全省大部县区领导同志都带头投入这一运动，大大鼓舞了群众的生产热情。
    在积肥运动告一段落时，各地进行了群众性的评比总结，提出了下一阶段的计划。有了更多的肥料，群众的增产信心也更加巩固和饱满了。
