Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, August 9th: The Soviet delegation attending the 18th International Red Cross Conference submitted a proposal at the General Committee meeting on the 1st, requesting all countries to conclude a convention banning atomic weapons. However, Britain put forward an amendment: "Requesting an international plan for controlling atomic energy to be agreed upon within the scope of general disarmament..." Its purpose was to cancel the Soviet proposal. During the discussion of this issue, the Chinese delegation issued two statements.

Li Dequan, Chief Representative of the Chinese Red Cross delegation, spoke in support of the original Soviet proposal, saying:

"The Chinese delegation warmly supports the original Soviet proposal, which requests all countries to conclude a convention banning atomic weapons. We support this proposal because it is entirely in line with the spirit of Resolutions No. 24 and No. 64 of the 17th International Red Cross Conference regarding the maintenance of world peace. The 18th Conference must further promote world peace on this basis. Those who advocate new wars are unscrupulously declaring war on humanitarianism. As for what this new war they are trying to launch will look like, we can find the answer in the Korean War. In the Korean War, the suffering endured by the Korean people, both in terms of its scale and its form, was unprecedentedly cruel. I must point out that the use of such means is only a prelude to the use of another weapon of terror—the atomic bomb." She pointed out that the people of all countries must rise up to stop such efforts for a new war. Otherwise, the disasters suffered by the Korean people today will befall the people of the whole world tomorrow.

Li Dequan continued: "On the other hand, this conference must pay attention to the fact that an unprecedented, worldwide movement to defend peace and oppose atomic war has grown and strengthened. The number of people in the world who have signed the declaration banning atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction has exceeded 500 million. This has become a large-scale mass movement. Since our International Red Cross movement regards seeking lasting world peace as its basic purpose, it should be pleased with these developments and should immediately take measures to participate in this practical struggle to defend peace.

The Chinese delegation has brought from China the unanimous will of 500 million people to safeguard humanitarianism and world peace. We sincerely hope that the governments and Red Cross delegations of all countries can put aside any differences they may have in race, religious belief, and political ideology, and stand with us on the issues of humanitarianism and peace, and stand with us on the issue of banning atomic weapons, which is closely related to this issue. Let us together pass the Soviet delegation's proposal requesting all countries to conclude a convention banning atomic weapons. The Chinese delegation firmly believes that only by passing this proposal without modification can we say that the 18th International Red Cross Conference has fulfilled its great and urgent moral obligations to the cause of humanitarianism and peace."

During the discussion of the British amendment to the Soviet proposal, the Chinese delegation stated as follows:

"We oppose the British amendment to the Soviet proposal to ban atomic weapons because the purpose of this proposal is to actually cancel the Soviet proposal and delay the issue of banning atomic weapons.

The British amendment says that the urgent issue of banning atomic weapons should be handed over to the United Nations Disarmament Commission for resolution. However, everyone knows that although this commission has been established for almost a year, due to various obstructionist tactics by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, the commission has not made any resolutions on the issue of general disarmament and banning atomic weapons.

From this, we can see that the real purpose of the British amendment is unwilling to allow the proposal on banning atomic weapons to pass.

Therefore, the British amendment is unacceptable. If the conference accepts this amendment, it will be equivalent to canceling several resolutions of the previous conference, which required all countries to solemnly guarantee not to use atomic energy for war purposes. If the conference does this, it will be openly abandoning its humanitarian principles and will completely lose its prestige in the eyes of the people of the world."

### 我代表团在国际红十字大会上发表声明  支持苏联代表团要求禁用原子武器的提案

    我代表团在国际红十字大会上发表声明
    支持苏联代表团要求禁用原子武器的提案
    【新华社多伦多九日电】出席第十八届国际红十字大会的苏联代表团，在一日大会总务委员会上提出一项议案，要求各国缔结禁用原子武器的公约。但英国提出一项修正案：“要求在普遍裁减军备的范围内协议一个国际管制原子能的计划。……”其目的在于取消苏联的提案。在讨论这个问题的时候，中国代表团曾发表两项声明。
    中国红十字会代表团首席代表李德全发言支持苏联原提案说：
    “中国代表团热烈支持苏联的原提案，这个提案要求各国缔结禁用原子武器的公约。我们支持这个提案，因为这个提案完全符合第十七届国际红十字大会关于维护世界和平的第二十四号决议和第六十四号决议的精神。第十八届大会必须在这个基础上进一步促进世界和平。鼓吹新战争的人是在肆无忌惮地对人道主义宣战。至于他们企图发动的这个新战争会像什么样子，那我们在朝鲜战争里可以找到答案。在朝鲜战争中，朝鲜人民所遭受的苦难，不论就它的规模来说或是就它的形式来说，都是空前残酷的。我必须指出：使用这种手段，不过是使用另一种恐怖的武器——原子弹的前奏。”她指出：各国人民必须起来制止这种新战争的努力。否则，今天朝鲜人民所遭受的灾难，明天就会落到全世界人民的头上。
    李德全接着说：“另一方面，本届大会一定要注意这个事实：空前的、世界范围的保卫和平、反对原子战争的运动，已经成长壮大。世界各国在禁止原子弹和其他大规模破坏武器宣言上签了名的人，数目已经超过了五亿。这已经变成了大规模的群众运动。我们国际红十字运动既然把谋取全世界的持久和平当成自己的基本宗旨，应该为这些发展感到高兴，并且应该马上采取措施来参加这个保卫和平的实际斗争。
    中国代表团从中国带来了五亿人民维护人道主义和世界和平的万众一心的意志。我们热诚地希望所有各国的政府和红十字会代表团能够抛开在种族、宗教信仰和政治思想方面可能有的一切分歧，在人道主义与和平的问题上和我们站在一起，在和这个问题有密切关系的要求禁用原子武器的问题上和我们站在一起。让我们一起通过苏联代表团这个要求所有各国缔结禁止原子武器的公约的提案吧。中国代表团坚信：只有不加修改地通过了这个提案，我们才能说第十八届国际红十字大会履行了它对于人道主义和和平的事业所负有的伟大而迫切的道德义务。”
    在讨论英国对苏联提案的修正案时，中国代表团发言如下：
    “我们反对英国对苏联禁用原子武器的提案的修正案，因为这个提案的目的，是要把苏联提案实际上取消掉，并拖延禁用原子武器的问题。
    英国修正案说，禁用原子武器的迫切问题应交给联合国裁减军备委员会去解决。可是人人都知道，联合国这个委员会虽然成立了已经差不多有一年，但由于美、英、法代表的种种阻挠手段，委员会在普遍裁军和禁用原子武器的问题上并没有作出任何决议。
    我们从这里就可以看出：英国修正案的真实目的是不愿意让关于禁用原子武器的提案通过。
    因此，英国修正案是无法接受的。大会如果接受了这个修正案，就等于是取消了上届大会的几项决议，这些决议要求各国庄严地保证不把原子能用于战争目的。大会如果这样作，就是公开抛弃它的人道原则，并且要完全丧失它在全世界人民眼里的威信。”
