    Engineer Zhang Youling of Wuhan Steel's "Masterpiece" Idea Ruined Things

    To the Editor: Zhang Youling used to be a very famous civil engineer, and he did some beneficial things for the people. However, in the past two years, the seventeen civil construction projects he designed for our Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant have all had errors. Among them, the errors in the design of the machine repair plant building are the most serious.

    The machine repair plant is one of the important production departments of the iron and steel plant, and the state invested 6 billion yuan to build this plant building. Zhang Youling did not design this project with an attitude of responsibility to the people. On the contrary, he only pursued the set of bourgeois tricks of so-called "novel style" and "beautiful lines," resulting in the project being completely divorced from the needs of production. He designed the roof into an arch-shaped thin-shell dome; used more steel bars and less cement in the mud pillars, minimizing the cross-section to seek beauty; and opened many glass windows on the surrounding walls, with the window area accounting for 68% of the entire plant wall. Zhang Youling was very satisfied with this "masterpiece." He said: this plant building has "advantages" such as beauty, economy, solidity, sufficient light, and large effective usable area. In fact, these "advantages" are all disadvantages, which not only hinder production but also damage the health of the workers.

    The newly built tall factory building has many windows and a thin roof, completely losing its ability to keep out the cold and heat. Last winter, the roof and the glass windows on all sides of the factory building were covered with a layer of white frost all day long. Although thirty-seven large stoves were lit, everyone's hands and feet were still frozen. If heating were installed in this factory building, it would cost at least 2 billion yuan, and there would also be technical difficulties. In the summer, the fiery sunlight shone into the factory building from the glass windows on all sides, making everyone sweat profusely, feel dizzy and have black eyes. The strong sunlight was blinding and hindered work. Now, we have to paint the glass windows on the east, west, and south sides with white powder, but it doesn't solve the problem.

    The thin roof is made of wood shells plastered with cement. It is neither economical nor strong. Taiyuan does not produce wood, and the wood for this roof was all bought from the Northeast. After calculation, it costs more than using steel frame roofs made from local materials. This kind of thin-shell roof is also not suitable for the climate conditions in Taiyuan, where the difference between hot and cold is very large. The roof already has many cracks and leaks.

    Due to production needs, this plant building should have been equipped with a 15-ton crane, but because the thin-shell roof plant building could not withstand the vibration caused by the crane, it has not been installed until now. Although the area inside the plant building is very large, the effective usable area is not large. Where machines are installed, the machines are arranged very densely. Only one operator can stand next to each machine, and a second person cannot pass. However, in the middle of the plant building, there is a two-meter wide space that has no use value.

    Why is the plant building designed for us by Engineer Zhang Youling so bad? In my opinion, this is because his bourgeois ideology is at work. In order to pursue formal beauty, he ignored the needs of our workers' work; in order to create personal "masterpieces," he disregarded the needs of production, causing major losses to the country's basic construction. It is said that Engineer Zhang Youling has already examined his "masterpiece" ideas, which is good. We hope that technical personnel like Zhang Youling will all properly transform their thinking so that they can do more beneficial things for the motherland.

### 武钢张有龄工程师的“杰作”思想坏了事情

    武钢张有龄工程师的“杰作”思想坏了事情
    编辑同志：张有龄过去是个很有名的土木工程师，他曾给人民办了一些有益的事情。但是，两年以来，他给我们太原钢铁厂设计了十七项土木建筑工程，都发生了错误。其中尤以机修厂厂房设计中的错误最为严重。
    机修厂是钢铁厂的重要生产部门之一，国家以六十亿元的巨款来建筑这个厂房。张有龄没有以对人民负责的态度，来设计这个工程，相反的，他只是追求所谓“风格新颖”、“线条秀丽”那一套资产阶级的玩艺，结果使工程完全脱离了生产的需要。他把屋顶设计成弓形薄壳的半圆顶；在泥柱中多用钢筋而少灌水泥，尽量缩小断面，以求美观；在四周的墙壁开了许多玻璃窗，窗户面积占整个厂房墙面的百分之六十八。张有龄对这个“杰作”十分满意，他说：这个厂房有美观、经济、坚固、光线充足和有效使用面积大等等“优点”。其实，这些“优点”都是缺点，不仅妨碍了生产，而且损害了工人的健康。
    新建筑的这座高大的厂房窗多、顶薄，完全失去御寒挡热的作用。去年冬天，厂房的房顶及四面的玻璃窗上，成天结着一层白霜。虽然生了三十七个头号大火炉，大伙的手脚还被冻僵了，如果在这个厂房安装暖气，最少得花二十亿元，而且技术上也有困难。到了夏季，火热的太阳光从四面的玻璃窗射进厂房，晒得大伙汗流浃背，头晕眼黑。强烈的阳光刺得人睁不开眼，妨碍工作。现在，我们不得不把东、西、南面的玻璃窗上涂了白粉，但也不解决问题。
    薄屋顶是用木壳抹水泥作成的。既不经济，也不坚固。太原附近不产木材，这个房顶的木料都是从东北买来的，计算一下，比就地取材用钢架房顶花的钱还多。这种薄壳房顶，又不适合太原热冷差别很大的气候条件，屋顶已经有许多地方裂缝漏雨了。
    因为生产的需要，这个厂房本应安装一架十五吨的天车，但由于薄壳屋顶的厂房经不起天车运走的震动，到现在还没有安装。厂房内的面积虽然很大，可是有效使用面积并不大。安装机器的地方，机器排的很密，每台机器旁边只能站一个操作的工人，第二个人就走不过去了。但在厂房中间的一部分，却宽出二公尺的地方，没有使用价值。
    为什么张有龄工程师给我们设计的厂房这样不好呢？照我看，这是他的资产阶级思想在作怪。他为了追求形式上的好看，竟不管我们工人工作的需要；他为了创造个人的“杰作”，竟不顾生产的需要，使国家基本建设遭受重大的损失。听说张有龄工程师已经检讨过他的“杰作”思想，这是好的。我们希望像张有龄这样的技术人员，都把自己的思想好好改造一下，以便给祖国做出更多有益的事情。
