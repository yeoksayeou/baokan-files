    Spring on the Grassland
    —Visiting the Settled Nomadic Life of the Mongolian People in the Left Banner of Tailibusi, Inner Mongolia
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    The Left Banner of Tailibusi (hereinafter referred to as Tailibusi Left Banner) is a rich and beautiful place in our motherland. Countless herds of livestock roam the green grasslands, and groups of yellow sheep (a type of wild sheep) run through the grass. Mongolian women take care of dairy cows by the village, and men ride fast horses, sometimes going to the grasslands to check on the herds, and sometimes rushing home to engage in other labor. The people of Tailibusi Left Banner have settled down. I visited a Mongolian cooperative in the Paotaiyingzi Village of this banner.
    The cooperative is quite large. The sales department occupies four large rooms, and the warehouse is even larger than the sales department. The wide courtyard is filled with ox carts loaded with various daily necessities. The sales department is filled with all kinds of goods, including fabrics of various colors, leather riding boots, leather saddles, flour, rice, sugar, and canned goods. Even at dusk, it was still crowded with shoppers. A herdsman holding a horse whip sat on a bench on the right, trying on a pair of black leather riding boots. In front of him, a young woman was holding three or four pieces of floral fabric, comparing them against herself. She said, "These floral fabrics are all good, I simply don't know which one to choose." Some children squeezed in front of the counter, some riding on adults' heads, pointing to buy sugar and canned goods. The four or five salespersons of the cooperative were sweating profusely.
    One salesperson said, "There are so many buyers every day, the people's purchasing power has truly increased." Another salesperson wiped the sweat from his face and said, "No matter what it is, as long as it's delivered, it's snapped up. Some expensive things, like tall leather boots or leather saddles, we initially thought we wouldn't be able to sell, but who knew they would be snatched up as soon as they arrived. One herdsman bought three pairs of leather boots at once. Herdsmen who couldn't buy them complained to the cooperative, complaining that the cooperative didn't bring enough goods." He handed a brick of tea to a buyer, and then said, "Take sugar for example, four or five hundred catties a month isn't enough. You know this banner only has over two thousand people!" According to the director of the cooperative, the cooperative is planning to expand; in order to facilitate Mongolians far from the cooperative to buy things, it is also preparing to organize mobile teams or branches.
    A Mongolian who bought a lot of flour, sugar, and brick tea, with the help of a translator, introduced me to the new life of the Mongolian people after liberation. He was from Jirenwusu Village, named Wuertunazeng. He said that Tailibusi Left Banner has a population of over two thousand, with only over seven thousand livestock before liberation, and now it has increased to over twenty-five thousand. The livestock in Jirenwusu Village has more than doubled since liberation, and everyone in the village has one or two new sets of clothes, and every family can eat white flour, rice, and rock candy. There are no more people in debt. Wuertunazeng said, "Look at me, the leather boots are new, the clothes are new, and the clothes of my family are also new. These are all the good days given to us by Mao Zedong. Before liberation, my family only had two cows and an old horse. If we didn't pick up cow dung and cut green grass for a day, we would starve. Now, I already have more than thirty cows, more than twenty sheep, and I bought two horses this spring." He shook my hand tightly and said:
    "Comrade, please stay at my house for a few days, you won't go hungry now."
    Another Mongolian named Saibu also talked to me about similar situations. He is from Bengbengshan Village and is a poor herdsman. Before liberation, his family of six had only one broken yurt and six or seven cows. They couldn't eat without picking up cow dung every day. Now, his family has built three new houses, and the broken yurt they used to live in has been made into a warehouse and kitchen. The number of cows has tripled, and he has also added twenty-seven sheep. Saibu's wife, Renqima, and the children all have new clothes, new shoes, and new socks. In the past, they would not have dared to dream of the whole family wearing new clothes at the same time.
    Leaving the cooperative, I visited the home of Mongolian Jiriganga (female) in Paotaiyingzi Village. She and her mother-in-law were milking cows. She brought out a low table and stools for us, and the table was filled with milk tea, milk wine, cheese curds, and rock candy. We asked her not to be so polite, she said:
    "It's not politeness. Before liberation, you couldn't eat anything when you came to our house!" Jiriganga's family has five people. Her mother-in-law said that before liberation, her family relied on Jiriganga selling her labor to survive. Now the family has twenty-seven cows, three horses, and thirty sheep. Many of the furniture in the house are newly bought. Last year, the whole family made two new sets of clothes each. This spring, Jiriganga and her mother-in-law each made a blue cheongsam. Her mother-in-law pointed to all these new things and said, "I have lived for six or seventy years, and this is the first time I have had such good days!"
    The Mongolian people all know how this happy life came about. They said that during the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, those man-eating devils drove away the herds of horses in this area, robbed the herdsmen of their cattle and sheep, and arrested the young Mongolian men. It made the entire grassland quiet and lifeless. In December 1948, just as the land was covered with white snow, the red flag of liberation was planted on this grassland, bringing light and happiness to the Mongolian compatriots. The Autonomous Region People's Government fully treated the people and livestock of Tailibusi Left Banner for diseases, in order to stop the trend of population and livestock decline; the People's Government sent hundreds of horses to the local poor herdsmen to help them restore animal husbandry. In order to reduce the illegal exploitation of the Mongolian people by unscrupulous merchants, the People's Government organized many cooperatives, transporting food and various daily necessities, and selling them to the Mongolian people at low prices. The lives of the Mongolian people are getting better day by day. Larma, a Mongolian woman from Shiban Village, said, "The People's Government has helped us have a good time. Look at these groups of calves, lambs, and foals. If it weren't for the People's Government rescuing us and helping us with epidemic prevention, where would they come from!" She said with a smile:
    "We have not only increased livestock, but also increased the population. Our small village added a dozen fat babies last year."
    The Mongolian people here are now practicing settled grazing. They said:
    "Settled grazing is so good, it creates very good conditions for our happy life." From nomadism to settlement is certainly a great step forward. However, during the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, settled grazing caused even greater disasters for the Mongolian people. Nomadic life is painful. A family takes the herd, pulls the yurt, and wanders around the endless grassland. It is difficult to find a household for hundreds of miles, and people and livestock can only wait for death when they get sick. It is extremely difficult to buy daily necessities. Unscrupulous merchants who buy pastureland can exchange a few flints or a few pieces of fire paper for a large sheep from the Mongolian people, or exchange a piece of clothing for a good horse from the Mongolian people. Jiriganga's mother-in-law said, "When we were nomadic, it cost seven or eight million yuan to build a yurt. Many herdsmen couldn't afford a yurt even if they earned money for a year. After settling down, building three houses only costs three or four million yuan, which saves money and is comfortable to live in." In order to get rid of the pain of nomadic life, the Mongolian people began to settle down. Many Mongolian people said that before liberation, settling down was worse than nomadism. Because after the people settled down, it was more convenient for the Chiang bandits to arrest recruits and rob livestock. The Chiang bandits even often used the method of wiping them out in one fell swoop. Even today, there are still more young women than young men in some villages. What about now? Wuertunazeng said, "With settled grazing, we can raise chickens, raise pigs, grow vegetables, and the People's Government can run schools and cooperatives for us. In a word, we have everything. This is in the Mao Zedong era, how could it be possible at other times!"
    The Mongolian people of Tailibusi Left Banner are not satisfied with the current situation. They are working hard for a happier life. They are learning to use horse-drawn mowers and are preparing to buy a horse-drawn mower for each village to prepare grass for the livestock in winter. They plan to install a waterwheel in each village, specifically for the herds to fetch water. As Jiamusu, the people's representative of Zuo (District), said: The lives of the Mongolian people are changing day by day. In a few years, you will see more herds, more children, and a better life here.

    草原上的春天
    ——访内蒙太仆寺左旗定居放牧的蒙民的生活
    本报记者　朱波
    太仆寺左旗（下简称太左旗）是我们祖国的一个富饶而又美丽的地方。无数的牧群在绿油油的草原上游荡，成群的黄羊（一种野羊）在草丛里奔跑。蒙族的妇女们在村边照顾奶牛，男人们骑着快马，一会儿跑到草原上去看看牧群，一会儿又奔回家来从事其他劳动。太左旗的人民已经定居下来了。我在这个旗的炮台营子村，访问这一个蒙民的合作社。
    合作社的规模相当大。售货处占了四大间房，库房比售货处还大。宽大的院子里挤满了装着各种日用品的牛车。售货处摆满了各种货物，有各色各样的布匹、皮马靴、皮马鞍子、面粉、大米、糖和罐头。就在这黄昏的时候，买东西的还是拥挤不堪。右边凳子上坐着一个手拿马鞭子的牧民，他正在试穿一双黑色的皮马靴。在他的前面，有一个青年妇女，拿三、四块花布，在身上比来比去。她说：“这些花布都好，我简直不知道挑那块好了。”有些孩子挤在柜台前边，有的骑在大人的头上，指点着买糖和罐头。合作社四、五个售货员累的满头流汗。
    一个售货员说：“每天的买主都是这样多，人们的购买力真正提高了。”另一个售货员抹抹脸上的汗水说：“不管什么东西，只要运来了，就给抢购
    一空。有些价钱贵的东西，像长筒皮靴或皮马鞍子，我们起初还以为卖不出去，谁知道一运来就抢光了。有一个牧民一下子买了三双皮靴。买不到的牧民就向合作社提出意见，嫌合作社运来的货太少了。”他递给一个买主一块砖茶，接着又说：“就说糖吧，一个月没有四、五百斤就对付不过去。你知道这个旗才只有两千多人口呀！”据合作社主任谈，合作社正在计划加以扩大；为了便利离合作社远的蒙胞购买东西，还准备组织流动小组或分社。
    一个买了许多面粉、糖和砖茶的蒙民，借着翻译的帮助，向我介绍解放后蒙族人民的新生活。他是吉仁乌苏村的人，名叫乌尔图那曾。他说，太左旗共有两千多人口，解放前只有七千多只牲畜，现在已增加到二万五千多只。吉仁乌苏村的牲畜比解放前增加了两倍多，全村的人都有了一两套新衣服，家家可以吃到白面、大米和冰糖。借债的人完全没有了。乌尔图那曾说：“你看一看我，皮靴是新的，衣裳是新的，家里人的衣裳也是新的，这都是毛泽东给我们的好日子啊。我家在解放前，只有两头牛、一匹老马，一天不拾牛粪，不割青草，就要饿肚子。现在，我已经有三十多头牛，二十多只羊，今年春天还买了两匹马。”他紧握着我的手说：
    “同志，请到我家里住几天，现在保险饿不着你了。”
    还有一个名叫赛布的蒙民，也和我谈过类似的情形。他是崩崩山村人，是一个贫苦的牧民。解放以前，他全家六口人，只有一个破蒙古包，六、七头牛。一天不拾牛粪就不能吃饭。现在，他家盖了三间新房子，而把以前住的破蒙古包作了仓库和厨房。牛增加了三倍，还添了二十七只羊。赛布的妻子仁其玛和孩子们都有了新衣服、新鞋和新袜子。而在过去，她们是不敢奢想一家人同时穿起新衣裳的。
    从合作社走出来，我又访问了炮台营子村蒙民吉日干嘎（女）的家庭。她正和她的婆婆在挤牛奶。她给我们搬出地桌、凳子，桌子上摆满牛奶茶、牛奶酒、奶豆腐和冰糖。我们请她不要客气，她说：
    “不是客气。解放以前来我们家，什么东西都吃不到呢！”吉日干嘎家共有五口人。她婆婆说，在解放以前，她家就靠吉日干嘎出卖劳动力过活。现在家里有了二十七头牛，三匹马，三十只羊。房子里很多家具都是新买的。去年全家每人都做了两套新衣服。今年春天，吉日干嘎和她婆婆每人做了一件蓝色的旗袍。她的婆婆指着这一切新东西说：“我活了六、七十岁了，像今天这样好的日子，还是第
    一次！”
    蒙族人民都知道这种幸福生活是怎样来的。他们说，在蒋介石匪帮统治时代，那些吃人的魔鬼赶走了这一带的马群，抢走了牧民的牛羊，抓走了蒙族的青年壮丁。使整个草原静悄悄的，一点生气都没有。一九四八年十二月，正是白雪掩盖着大地的时候，解放的红旗插到这一带草原上，给蒙族同胞带来了光明和幸福。自治区人民政府全力给太左旗的人民和牲畜治疗疾病，以便停止人口和牲畜下降的趋势；人民政府送给当地贫苦牧民数百匹马，帮助他们恢复畜牧事业。为了减少奸商对蒙族人民的非法的剥削，人民政府组织了许多合作社，运来食粮和各种日用品，廉价卖给蒙族人民。蒙族人民的生活一天比一天好起来了。石板村的蒙族妇女拉玛说：“人民政府帮助我们过好了时光。你看这一群一群的牛犊、羊羔、马驹，如果不是人民政府救济我们，帮助我们防疫，这从那里来呀！”她笑着说：
    “我们不只增加了牲畜，也增加了人口。我们这一个小村，去年就添了十几个胖娃娃。”
    这里的蒙族人民现在实行定居放牧。他们说：
    “定居放牧是太好了，它给我们的幸福生活创造了很好的条件。”从游牧到定居，当然是一大进步。但是，在蒋介石匪帮统治时代，定居放牧却给蒙族人民造成更大的灾难。游牧生活是痛苦的。一家人带着牧群，拉着蒙古包，在漫无边际的草原上游来游去，几百里找不到一户人家，人和牲畜病了只能等死。购买日用品是极困难的，买跑草地的奸商能用几块火石或几张火纸交换蒙族人民一只大羊，或用
    一件衣服交换蒙族人民一匹好马。吉日干嘎的婆婆说：“在游牧的时候，造一个蒙古包就要花七、八百万元，很多牧民一年挣的钱，还造不起一个蒙古包。定居下来以后，盖三间房子只要三、四百万元，又省钱，住着又舒服。”为了摆脱游牧生活的痛苦，蒙族人民开始定居下来。很多蒙族人民说，在解放以前，定居比游牧还要坏。因为人民定居以后，蒋匪帮抓壮丁、抢牲畜，更加方便了。蒋匪帮甚至常常采用一网打尽的办法。直到今天，有些村子里的青年妇女还是多过青年男子。现在怎么样呢？乌尔图那曾说：“定居放牧了，能够养鸡、养猪，种青菜，人民政府还能给我们办学校、办合作社，一句话，什么都有了。这是在毛泽东时代，其他时候那能行啊！”
    太左旗的蒙族人民，对现有的情形并没有满足。他们正为更幸福的生活而努力。他们正在学习使用马拉割草机，准备每村买一张马拉割草机为牲畜准备冬季的草。他们计划每村安一辆水车，专门为牧群打水喝。正如佐（区）人民代表加木苏说：蒙族人民的生活一天一天的在变化着，再过几年，你会在这里看到更多的牧群，更多的孩子，更好的生活。
