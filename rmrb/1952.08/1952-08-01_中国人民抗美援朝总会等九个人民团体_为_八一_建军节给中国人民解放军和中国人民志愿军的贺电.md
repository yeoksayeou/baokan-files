Dear comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the great "August 1st" Army Day, we would like to express our warm congratulations and pay our highest respects to you on behalf of the people of the whole country.

    Since August 1, 1927, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, after a full 22 years of heroic struggle, finally completely defeated the Kuomintang reactionary army supported by American imperialism, overthrew the counter-revolutionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, and won a great victory for the revolution. In the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Liberation Army has made great achievements in the great cause of consolidating national defense and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and has created amazing miracles in participating in production and construction, which has aroused great love and praise from the people of the whole country. In the past one year and nine months, the Chinese People's Volunteers have won brilliant victories on the Korean battlefield, shattered the arrogant plan of American imperialism to invade Korea, defended the security of the motherland, and defended peace in Asia and the world, thus winning the praise and respect of all the Chinese people and all peace-loving and just people in the world.

    Dear comrades! Today, the American aggressors are still continuing to delay the Korean armistice negotiations, still occupying our territory of Taiwan, and are intensifying their mad provocations against the Chinese and Korean people, attempting to further expand the war of aggression. Therefore, we must be more vigilant, strengthen national defense construction, and continue to strive for the final victory of the Korean anti-aggression war and for the defense of the motherland's security and world peace. Our people across the country pledge to more actively launch the movement to increase production and practice economy, strengthen economic construction, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army standing at the forefront of the struggle with greater strength. Glory will forever belong to the iron warriors who defend the motherland and peace!

    中国人民抗美援朝总会等九个人民团体
    为“八一”建军节给中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的贺电亲爱的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军全体同志们：
    值此伟大的“八一”建军节二十五周年纪念日，我们谨表示热诚的庆贺，并代表全国人民向你们致崇高的敬礼。
    从一九二七年八月一日起，中国人民解放军经过整整二十二年的英勇奋斗，最后终于彻底打败了美帝国主义所支持的国民党反动军队，推翻了蒋介石反革命统治，使革命获得了伟大的胜利。中华人民共和国成立以后的三年来，人民解放军又在巩固祖国国防和巩固人民民主专政的伟大事业中树立了伟大的功勋，并且在参加生产建设等工作上，创造了惊人奇迹，因而引起全国人民极大的敬爱与赞扬。中国人民志愿军在过去一年另九个多月中，在朝鲜战场上获得了辉煌的胜利，粉碎了美帝国主义对朝鲜的狂妄的侵略计划，保卫了祖国的安全，保卫了亚洲的和世界的和平，因而赢得了全中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平与正义的人民的赞扬和尊敬。
    亲爱的同志们！今天，美国侵略者仍在继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判，仍霸占着我国领土台湾，并在变本加厉地对中朝人民进行疯狂挑衅，妄图进一步扩大侵略战争。因此，我们必须更加提高警惕，加强国防建设，为争取朝鲜反侵略战争的最后胜利，为保卫祖国安全与世界和平而继续奋斗。我们全国人民誓将更积极地开展增产节约运动，加强经济建设，以更大的力量支援站在斗争最前线的中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军。光荣永远属于保卫祖国与和平的钢铁战士！
