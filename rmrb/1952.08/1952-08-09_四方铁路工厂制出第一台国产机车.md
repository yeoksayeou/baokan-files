The employees of the Sifang Railway Factory, under the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, held a grand ceremony on the 1st to celebrate the completion of the first domestically produced locomotive, the "August 1st," in celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day.

The "August 1st" locomotive was manufactured entirely from domestically produced materials. During the manufacturing process, the employees of the Sifang Railway Factory fully utilized their high degree of creativity and initiative, ensuring that the quality of the locomotive fully met specifications. The appearance of the first domestically produced locomotive in New China not only demonstrates the great creativity of the Chinese working class and the superiority of New Democracy, but also has significant implications for consolidating national defense, developing New China's construction endeavors, and strengthening the motherland's transportation undertakings. The "August 1st" locomotive completion ceremony began with Yi Yaocai, Commander of the Qingdao Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, representing the Chinese People's Liberation Army to accept the gift and cut the ribbon. As the new locomotive, adorned with portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and decorated with colorful silk, slowly moved forward, the audience erupted in warm applause and cheers. Yi Yaocai, Commander of the Qingdao Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a speech, first expressing warm congratulations and gratitude to all the employees of the Sifang Railway Factory on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said: The appearance of the new domestically produced locomotive shows that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class has overcome many difficulties and once again achieved a great victory on the industrial front, laying a solid foundation for building a strong national defense and economic strength in the future. He then called on all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to continue to study and improve military technology, strengthen national defense, and safeguard the motherland and world peace. Lai Keke, Mayor of the Qingdao Municipal People's Government, pointed out in his speech: The new locomotive symbolizes that our motherland's industry is leaping forward with each passing day. He encouraged all employees to make persistent efforts to strengthen the motherland's national defense and economic construction. Liu Wei, Director of the Sifang Railway Factory, firmly stated on behalf of all the factory's employees: In the great patriotic production increase and thrift movement, we must continue to work hard to manufacture a large number of new locomotives to enhance the country's railway transportation; and use this practical action to support the Chinese People's Volunteers who have repeatedly made contributions in defending world peace. At the meeting, all the employees of the Sifang Railway Factory sent a letter of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. (Xinhua News Agency)
