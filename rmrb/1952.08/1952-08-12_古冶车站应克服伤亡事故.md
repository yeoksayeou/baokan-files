    Guye Station Should Overcome Accidents
    Editor: The administrative leaders of Guye Station under the Tianjin Railway Administration do not provide sufficient safety education for employees. Some operating procedures and safety systems exist only in form, leading to continuous accidents resulting in injuries and deaths.
    At around 4:00 AM on July 26th, Wei Jiayu, a coupler from the 202 shunting crew, was inspecting vehicles from west to east. When he reached the end car placed by the 201 shunting crew, he discovered that the coupler was not open. He immediately lifted the lock and moved the knuckle. At this time, the 201 shunting crew was performing a "topping" maneuver. According to regulations, the 201 shunting crew's coupler should have first inspected the end of the car and then sent a signal to the shunter. However, this coupler sent the signal to shunt the train in the middle of the car, resulting in the death of Wei Jiayu, who was in the process of lifting the lock. Prior to this, on July 17th, this station had also experienced an incident of violating operating procedures and running over a coupler, but this did not attract the attention of the administrative leaders, leading to continuous accidents resulting in injuries and deaths.
    We hope that the Tianjin Railway Administration will quickly address this issue. It should also thoroughly inspect the implementation of operating procedures and safety systems in its jurisdiction to prevent similar accidents from occurring.

    古冶车站应克服伤亡事故
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局古冶车站行政领导干部，对职工安全教育不够，一些操作规程及安全制度流于形式，以致连续发生伤亡事故。
    七月二十六日早晨四点钟左右，二○二调车组连接员魏家玉，由西向东检查车辆，走到二○一调车组所放的尾车附近时，发现车钩没有开，当即提钩锁搬钩舌，这时二○一调车组正在进行顶车，按规定，二○一调车组连接员应先到车尾进行检查，然后发信号给调车员，但这个连接员走到车中间就发信号调车，致使正在提钩的魏家玉撞死。在这以前，七月十七日，这个站也曾发生违反操作规程、轧伤连接员的事件，但并未引起行政领导干部的注意，以致又连续发生伤亡事故。
    我们希望天津铁路管理局赶快处理这一问题。并应切实检查所辖地区的操作规程及安全制度的执行情况，以防止类似事故的发生。
