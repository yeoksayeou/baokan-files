Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 12th: The Hong Kong and Kowloon Civil Aviation Workers' Union has issued a letter of protest against the British government's seizure of the two airlines' property in Hong Kong belonging to our country and the beating of our personnel protecting the assets. They also expressed their firm support for the protest statement made by Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government on August 2nd. The letter of protest, after recounting the British government's extremely barbaric means of seizing this property of our country, said: "All members of this union express unparalleled anger at this unreasonable behavior of the British government and lodge a serious protest. We also fully support the statement of Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 2nd."

The letter of protest then pointed out: The British government's attitude of hostility towards the People's Republic of China is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. We solemnly declare that the British government should immediately return all the property of the two airlines belonging to the People's Republic of China, should immediately stop the oppression of the two airlines' personnel protecting the assets, and should guarantee their freedom and safety and not infringe upon them.

The letter of protest finally encouraged the employees of the two airlines remaining in Hong Kong to carry forward their consistent heroic spirit, to persevere unyieldingly in protecting the people's property of the motherland to the end.
