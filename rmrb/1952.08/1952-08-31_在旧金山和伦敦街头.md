    On the Streets of San Francisco and London
    Despite the clouds obscuring the dove of peace, the determined peace fighters of San Francisco braved the wind and rain. They mobilized the entire city to demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact and the exchange of prisoners of war in Korea. On Saturday, June 28th, they collected 1,125 signatures.
    The warriors mobilizing signatures were children and young people. Among them, the youngest two dozen children rode around the city in a specially designed peace vehicle decorated with slogans and branches.
    The employees of the Graphic Arts Factory stayed up late the night before. They made a large globe with a dove of peace standing on it. However, the weather was too bad, and it would damage the paper globe and the dove's not-yet-dry colors. So, they decided to save it for later use. In the pouring rain, the young people tried to dissuade the children from going, but the children stubbornly refused, and finally went out happily.
    Fourteen-year-old Wayne said, "Almost all the children are talking about their own concerns. Some children talk about what happened to their fathers in Korea, that they should go home and not be killed. I said that if the war drags on, the draft age will be lowered, and some of us will be drafted to fight."
    The children ate lunch, sang songs, and cheered on the vehicle, urging passersby to sign the petition demanding an end to the Korean War. The response was so great that in some places people were waiting in line to sign. At 22nd Street and Mission Street, more than 300 people signed.
    The rainy weather added to the car's troubles, and it broke down near 17th Street and Mission Street. Mechanical workers among the pedestrians volunteered to help them repair it, but the car broke down again halfway in the afternoon and did not reach its intended destination.
    When the children went home, they earnestly asked to come again next time.

    On June 29th, thousands of London citizens held a rally in Hyde Park, condemning the American bombing of the Yalu River hydroelectric power stations and demanding an end to the Korean War. A grand parade was held after the meeting.
    This movement is part of the recent protest movements that have swept across Britain and the British Peace Committee's "Half-Month of Peace" campaign.
    Six of the seven platforms in Hyde Park were plastered with foot-high blue signs with white letters: "End the Korean War Now."
    Crowds gathered around the speakers, listening to their speeches. Finally, the masses stood up and approved a resolution condemning the bombing of the Yalu River hydroelectric power stations. The resolution said: "We believe this is a deliberate act to expand the Korean War to China." "We demand that the British government insist on: an immediate cessation of all combat in order for the armistice negotiations to succeed and the repatriation of all prisoners of war."
    One of the prominent speakers, Punnaji Mills, called for Britain to gain independence from the shackles of the United States. He said: Let us join hands with the people of the colonies. This unity will liberate both Britain and the colonial people, and ensure world peace.
    After the resolution was passed, most of the audience participated in the peace march after the meeting. The march was led by the British Peace Committee's band and banners. Thousands upon thousands of people stopped to watch and read the words on the marchers' banners and placards. When the marchers shouted "Come and join us," many people joined the march. They shouted: "Oppose German rearmament!" "We don't need war - why should we pay for it!" "Exchange prisoners of war immediately!"
    The marchers finally gathered at Alford Square, where they heard a speech by Wyatt, the organizing secretary of the British Peace Committee. He said: "We are here to express our determination to unite all forces striving for the unwavering struggle to end the Korean War." This afternoon, more than seventy people joined the British Peace Committee. (Zhang Yingdun excerpted and translated from the San Francisco "People's World" and the London "Worker's Daily")

    在旧金山和伦敦街头
    尽管阴云遮住了和平鸽，但坚决的旧金山的和平战士们冒着风雨出动了。他们在动员全城人民要求缔结五大国和平公约，要求交换在朝鲜的战俘。六月二十八日（星期六）这一天，他们征集了一千一百二十五个人的签名。
    动员签名的战士都是儿童和青年。其中最小的二十几个儿童坐在一辆特设的用标语和树枝装饰起来的和平车上，周游全城。
    图表艺术工厂的员工们头一天夜里睡得很晚。他们制成了一个大地球，上面站着一只和平鸽子。可是天气太不好，会弄坏纸地球和鸽子上还没有干的色彩。于是他们决定把它留待以后再用。在倾盆大雨中，青年们劝儿童不要去，可是儿童们硬不答应，最后还是兴高彩烈地出去了。
    十四岁的维恩说：“几乎所有的儿童都在谈论着自己的心事。一些儿童谈着爸爸们在朝鲜的遭遇，他们应该回家了，不应该被打死。我说，如果战争长久拖下去，征兵的年龄将要降低，我们当中的一些人也会被征去打仗。”
    儿童们在车上吃中饭、唱歌、欢呼，呼吁行人在请愿书上签名，要求制止朝鲜战争。反应是如此之大，有的地方人们排着队在等候签名。在二十二号街和米新街，签名的有三百多人。
    雨天给汽车增加了麻烦，在十七号街与米新街附近抛锚了。行人中的机械工人们自愿去帮他们修理，但下午车子又在半途发生了故障，没有达到预定的终点。
    儿童们回家的时候，都恳切地要求下次再来。

    六月二十九日，数千伦敦市民在海德公园举行了大会，谴责美国对鸭绿江水电站的轰炸，要求结束朝鲜战争。会后并举行了盛大的游行。
    这次运动是最近遍及英国各地的抗议运动和英国和平委员会发动的“半月和平”运动中的一部分。
    海德公园的七个讲坛中，有六个讲坛上贴着一尺高的蓝底白字：“立即结束朝鲜战争”。
    群众聚集在讲演者的四周，倾听他们的讲话。最后群众起立赞成谴责轰炸鸭绿江水电站的决议。决议说：“我们认为这是故意将朝鲜战争扩张到中国的行动。”“我们要求英国政府坚持：立即停止一切战斗，以便停战谈判成功，并遣返全体战俘。”
    著名的演讲者之一，普那兹·密尔斯要求从美国的枷锁下使英国获得独立。他说：让我们与殖民地的人民携起手来。这种团结将会使英国与殖民地的人民都获得解放，使世界和平得到保障。
    通过决议之后，大部分听众都参加了会后的和平游行。游行由英国和平委员会的乐队和旗帜领先。成千成万的人驻足观看，并读着游行者的旗帜和标语牌上的字句。当游行者向他们喊着“来参加呀”时，很多人加入了游行的行列。他们高喊着：“反对德国重新武装！”“我们不需要战争——为什么我们要出钱！”“立即交换战俘！”
    游行者最后集合在阿尔佛德广场，听取了英国和平委员会组织部长魏莱特的讲话。他说：“我们在这里表示决心：联合一切为着结束朝鲜战争而作不屈不挠的斗争的力量。”这天下午，有七十余人加入了英国和平委员会。（张应焞摘译自旧金山“人民世界”、伦敦“工人日报”）
