    The Shenyang Smelting Plant, during the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, under the leadership of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, led all employees in a broad and in-depth discussion of the national production plan. They tapped potential, found shortcuts, promoted advanced experiences, and formulated advanced plans for increasing production and practicing economy, as well as a series of specific measures plans to ensure the completion of the increase production and practice economy plans, such as plans for promoting advanced experiences, technical organization measures plans, labor protection, and safety measures plans. The administrative side and the employees and their families jointly formulated a plan to improve the collective welfare undertakings of the employees. In order to effectively realize the above-mentioned plans and ensure the successful completion of the production plan and the increase production and practice economy plan, the plant administration and the trade union jointly signed a collective contract for the second half of 1952. Through this effective organizational means, they organically organized various specific measures plans around the overall increase production and practice economy plan.

    Detailed Measures Plan for Promoting Advanced Experiences

    The first part of the contract directly proposes to guarantee an increase in production and economy for the country worth 111,889 tons of grain. It also stipulates specific indicators for improving quality, increasing production, reducing costs, and basic construction. The second part clearly proposes that the principle of "quality first, safety first" must be implemented in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, and measures plans to ensure the realization of this requirement. The third part specifically embodies Chairman Gao Gang’s instruction that promoting advanced experiences is the main way to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy. According to the different situations of each workshop, it stipulates the key advanced experiences that each should promote, and stipulates the steps and methods of promotion. For example, the cathode group of the lead electrolysis workshop promoted the hot single-lap operation method; the melting pot class learned the Soviet sulfur powder copper removal method and promoted the multiple stirring and multiple slag removal operation method; the electrical adjustment group promoted the milliampere meter inspection method; the electrolysis group learned from the Soviet advanced experience to increase the amount of acid and promoted the "two stabilities and two correctnesses" operation method. As a result of promoting these advanced experiences, the quality of electrolytic lead in the fourth quarter is required to increase from 99.98 percent to 99.99 percent, which can increase the country's income by 1 billion yuan per month. The fourth part of the contract is a strong guarantee for the realization of the first three parts. The clauses clearly state that "improving business management is the basic condition for the smooth completion of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Plan." In addition to ensuring that work plans are formulated around the central work of each month, focusing on improving workshop management, and timely supplying raw materials, power, fuel and other guarantee conditions, the administration also decided to learn the advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," the Soviet advanced experience of comprehensive original records, and the experience of economic analysis of advanced enterprises, in order to improve production management and prepare conditions for the realization of various plans.

    Jointly Formulating Collective Welfare Measures Plans with All Employees and Their Families

    The contract also embodies Chairman Gao Gang's important instruction that "we must pay attention to improving the collective welfare undertakings of employees." The fifth part of the contract is the eleven collective welfare undertakings plans jointly formulated by the leadership after in-depth investigation and with all employees and their families. The first item is the renovation of dormitories and improvement of sanitation, which are the most urgent requirements of employees and their families. In order to meet the needs of the masses, five specific solutions were proposed in this item alone: 317 dormitories should be overhauled; 737 dormitories should have partitions built to separate the stove from the kang; all new dormitories built since 1950 and dormitories overhauled in 1951 should be whitewashed; three new Western-style wells should be built, and 17 Western-style wells should be repaired; and two-thirds of the dormitories with three or more occupants should be fitted with screens. In order to ensure the realization of all the contents of the contract, the administration and the trade union put forward specific measures from different perspectives. For example, after the contract proposed "ensure safe production, overcome various loopholes in technical security, and eliminate major casualties," the administration put forward six items and fifteen clauses of methods to increase labor protection equipment and labor protection products. The trade union put forward four items of methods to educate workers to establish the idea of safety first and consciously abide by labor discipline and technical safety regulations. This will ensure the realization of the contract. This makes the collective contract a comprehensive organizational plan and action program for the entire plant to complete the national plan.

    The Contract is a Summary of a Series of Specific Works in the Past and a Comprehensive Work Program for the Enterprise in the Future

    Just as Director Chen Jian said, "The collective contract is a concrete portrayal of enterprise management." The reason why this contract can become a comprehensive action program for the entire plant, from the director to the workers, from the administration to the trade union, is because the content of the contract is very detailed and specific. And the reason why it is possible to formulate such a detailed and specific contract is because they have already done a series of specific works in various aspects beforehand, and the contract is only a summary and synthesis of these specific works.

    On May 8, the smelting plant held a plant-wide employee meeting to convey Chairman Gao Gang's report on May 7 calling for the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. Director Chen Jian clearly stated that this year's Increase Production and Practice Economy Plan should be completed by promoting advanced experiences. According to the specific situation that there are no formed and systematic advanced experiences in smelting technology and operation, the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League concentrated their efforts to lead all employees in carrying out the movement to find shortcuts. Wu Zhongxi, secretary of the Party branch of the roasting furnace workshop, personally went deep into the Ji Renqiang group, using points to promote the whole, to specifically lead the shortcut finding movement in the entire workshop. Based on the clue that the product quality of old technicians Jiao Changxiang and Pang Lianfu was usually higher than others, and that they had solutions to difficulties, Wu Zhongxi and Party member Xin Jianfen helped Jiao Changxiang and Pang Lianfu separately. Through discussions on how Jiao Changxiang and Pang Lianfu usually operated, they found shortcuts to handle raw materials, handle hard lumps, handle empty winds, and handle melting from the conversation, which were summarized into four major operation methods by technicians. This solved the key technical problem in the roasting furnace workshop. In the shortcut finding movement, they organized most of the technicians to help workers summarize shortcuts technically and theoretically. Lin Qi, the special technician of the true blowing furnace workshop, analyzed the specific facts that the actual recovery rate of the true blowing furnace workshop was gradually increasing, and that the true blowing furnace could produce fine copper when it could not produce fine copper. He affirmed that there must be advanced experiences among the masses. So, he continuously analyzed 263 different operation methods, enriched the 45 shortcuts proposed by the workers, and summarized the quick copper smelting method of large airflow slag. Huang Jianshi, deputy engineer, and Dong Dianxiang group of the lead blast furnace workshop jointly studied the successful operation method of "adding iron filings to the forehearth." This reduced the lead content in the slag from 1.5 percent to 0.8 percent, increased the actual recovery rate of lead, and solved the old problem of excessive lead content in the slag that had not been solved for three years. Technicians and workers in the reverberatory furnace workshop jointly created the high-temperature rotation feeding, refining ash removal, and multi-tube oxidation method. The lead electrolysis workshop summarized more than 300 large and small shortcuts into ten major operation methods such as "hot single-lap," "milliampere meter inspection," and "multiple stirring and multiple slag removal." In May alone, the workers of the entire plant found 951 shortcuts, which were analyzed technically and theoretically by technicians, summarized and reduced into 33 systematic operation methods of decisive significance - this is the advanced experience that should be promoted in each workshop and each major production process, which is fixed in the contract with clauses.

    At the end of May, while the workers were enthusiastically finding shortcuts, the leaders of the smelting plant were already brewing how to rationally use the enterprise fund; meet the urgent requirements of workers and their families; and formulate practical collective welfare undertakings plans. And they had already started to engage in meticulous preparatory work. The administration first calculated the total amount of the enterprise fund based on the total value of the wealth produced by the workers for the country this year. Then, according to Chairman Gao Gang's instructions, the 45 percent of the enterprise fund used for collective welfare undertakings, plus the surplus from last year, amounted to 1.35 billion yuan this year to improve collective welfare undertakings. Then, the trade union went deep into each workshop and family residential area to widely collect the requirements and opinions of workers and their families. The administration and the trade union jointly studied more than 300 proposals from the masses, fully estimated the role that 1.35 billion yuan could play, and proposed ten major collective welfare undertakings plans for this year. The Party secretary, director, trade union chairman, and Communist Youth League secretary personally led 20 relevant cadres to visit eight family residential areas and two single workers' dormitories to carefully compare whether the plans proposed by the leaders coincided with the requirements of the masses. The leaders also handed over the detailed plan that had already been prepared, "How much money we have and what we are going to do," to the workers and their families for discussion. Finally, the collective welfare undertakings plan was passed at the employee representative meeting. This is the specific content of improving employee welfare undertakings on the basis of developing production and increasing national wealth, which is the fifth part of the contract.

    In short, in the early stage of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the series of specific measures plans formulated by the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League to lead all employees of the smelting plant, such as the plan for promoting advanced experiences, the security measures plan, the technical organization measures plan, and the collective welfare undertakings plan, are the basis for the various contents of the collective contract for the second half of 1952. From this, it can be seen that the smelting plant did not regard the signing of the collective contract as an isolated work task. Instead, it regarded the collective contract as an effective means of organizing production. Through the contract, it integrated and fixed the work of the previous stage, and used it as an organizational plan and action program for the entire plant to complete the increase production and economy of more than 110,000 tons of grain beyond the plan.

    Discovering Past Shortcomings and Promoting the Next Step of Work Through Signing the Contract

    Therefore, the contract has also become a mirror, reflecting the entire picture of past work, and from which shortcomings have been discovered. For example, as reflected in the draft contract, the main content of improving product quality is only a few abstract numerical indicators, lacking specific measures to ensure that these numbers are put into practice. This exposed that the work of improving product quality is still a relatively weak link in the series of work that has been done in the smelting plant. This enabled the leadership to discover problems in a timely manner. When mobilizing employees to discuss the draft contract, it clearly proposed to focus on in-depth quality make-up lessons as the main content of the contract discussion, and concentrated efforts to lead the quality make-up lesson movement. During the discussion, the Party branch of the reverberatory furnace workshop first studied the situation, and leading cadres such as the workshop director took the lead in self-criticism, driving nearly half of the workers to examine the ideas of neglecting quality. After this discussion, the complacent thinking of not paying attention to quality was exposed among the leading cadres and among the employees. The cadres and employees realized that improving quality is the main problem in the current work, which paved the way for improving product quality. Finally, in the written collective contract, the main content of improving quality has been put forward as a policy that must be implemented in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement.

    The collective contract is an effective means of organizing production. The signing of the collective contract for the second half of 1952 by the smelting plant created a precedent for using the collective contract to organize production. (Wang Dianxue)

    沈阳冶炼厂行政和工会签订集体合同
    沈阳冶炼厂在增产节约运动中，党、行政、工会、青年团领导全体职工，广泛、深入地讨论国家生产计划，挖潜力、找窍门、推广先进经验，制订了先进的增产节约计划和保证完成增产节约计划的一系列具体措施计划，如推广先进经验计划、技术组织措施计划、劳动保护、保安措施计划等等。行政方面和职工及工人家属又共同制订了改善职工集体福利事业的计划。为使上述各项计划切实实现，以保证生产计划和增产节约计划的胜利完成，该厂行政和工会又共同签订了一九五二年下半年的集体合同，通过这一有效的组织手段，围绕着总的增产节约计划，把各项具体措施计划有机地组织了起来。
    详尽的推广先进经验措施计划
    合同第一部分开门见山地提出保证超计划为国家增产节约价值十一万一千八百八十九吨粮食的财富。并规定了提高质量、增加产量、降低成本、基本建设等项的具体指标。第二部分明确提出在增产节约运动中，必须贯彻“质量第一、安全第一”的方针，和保证实现这一要求的措施计划。第三部分具体体现了高岗主席关于推广先进经验是完成增产节约任务的主要办法的指示，根据各个车间的不同情况，规定了各自应推广的重点先进经验，并规定了推广的步骤和方法。如铅电解车间阴极组推广趁热单搭操作法；熔锅班学习苏联加硫粉脱铜法，推广多次搅拌多次捞渣操作法；电调组推广毫量表检查法；电解组学习苏联先进经验增加酸量、推广“两稳两正”操作法。推广这些先进经验的结果，要求第四季度电解铅质量由百分之九十九点九八提高到百分之九十九点九九，每月即可为国家增加十亿元的收入。合同的第四部分是实现前三部分的有力保证，条文里明确提出：“改善经营管理是顺利完成增产节约计划的基本条件”，行政上除了保证围绕每月中心工作制订工作计划，有重点地改进车间管理工作，及时供应原材料、动力、燃料等等保证条件外，还决定学习“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”、学习苏联全面原始记录的先进经验和先进企业经济分析的经验，以提高生产管理水平，给实现各项计划准备条件。
    与全体职工及家属共同制订集体福利措施计划
    合同也体现了高岗主席关于“必须注意改善职工集体福利事业”的重要指示。合同的第五部分就是经过领导深入调查，与全体职工和家属共同制订的十一项集体福利事业计划。其中第一项是职工和家属要求最迫切的整修宿舍、改善卫生。为满足群众要求，只在这一项中就分别提出五种具体处理办法：要大修理宿舍三百十七间；有七百三十七间宿舍要打间壁，把锅台与炕隔开；一九五○年以来新建宿舍与一九五一年大修宿舍全部刷浆；新建三个洋井，修理十七个洋井；把住三个人以上的宿舍，安三分之二的纱窗。为了保证合同全部内容的实现，行政与工会从不同角度提出了具体措施。如合同中提出“确保安全生产，克服技术保安方面各种漏洞，消灭重大伤亡事故”一条后，行政上提出了六项十五款办法，增加劳动保护设备和劳动保护品。工会提出了四项办法，教育工人树立安全第一的思想，自觉地遵守劳动纪律与技术保安规程。这样就可以保证合同的实现。这样就使得集体合同成为全厂完成国家计划的全面的组织计划和行动纲领。
    合同是过去一系列具体工作的总结，是今后的企业全面工作纲领
    正像陈健厂长所谈：“集体合同是企业管理的具体写照。”这次的合同，所以能够成为全厂从厂长到工人、从行政到工会的全面行动纲领，是因为合同的内容很详尽很具体。而所以能够订出这样的详尽的具体的合同来，则是由于他们事前在各个方面已经做了一系列的具体工作，合同只是这些具体工作的总结和综合。
    五月八日，冶炼厂召开全厂职工大会，传达五月七日高岗主席号召开展增产节约运动报告时，陈健厂长即明确提出今年要靠推广先进经验完成增产节约计划。根据冶炼技术与操作方面还没有出现成型的系统的先进经验这一具体情况，党、行政、工会、青年团曾集中力量领导全厂职工开展找窍门运动。焙烧炉车间党支部书记吴忠喜亲自深入季仁强小组，以点推面，具体领导全车间找窍门运动。吴忠喜根据老技术工人焦常祥与庞连福两人平素产品质量比别人高，遇到困难有办法解决这个线索，与党员莘建芬分头帮助焦常祥、庞连福，通过讨论焦常祥、庞连福平素如何操作，从谈话中就找出处理生料、处理硬块、处理空风、处理熔化的窍门，经技术人员总结成四大操作法。解决了培烧炉车间技术上的关键问题。在找窍门运动中，他们组织了绝大部分技术人员从技术上，理论上帮助工人总结窍门。真吹炉车间专责技术员林其椇分析了真吹炉车间的实收率逐渐提高，真吹炉由不能出精铜到能出精铜等具体事实之后，肯定群众中一定有先进经验。于是就连续分析了二百六十三炉不同的操作方法，充实了工人提出的四十五个窍门，总结出了大风流渣快速炼铜法。黄俭师副工程师与铅鼓风炉车间董殿祥小组共同研究“前床加铁屑”操作法成功。使渣子含铅从百分之一点五降低到百分之零点八，提高了铅的实收率，解决了三年来不得解决的渣含铅过多的老问题。反射炉车间技术员和工友共同创造了高温轮换进料、精炼清灰、多管氧化法。铅电解车间，把大小三百多件窍门，总结成“趁热单搭”、“毫量表检查”、“多次搅拌多次捞渣”等十大操作法。五月一个月，全厂工友找出九百五十一件窍门，经技术人员从技术上理论上分析、归纳，总结成三十三条系统的有决定意义的操作方法。——这就是在合同中用条文固定起来的，每个车间每道主要生产工序应推广的先进经验。
    五月末，还在工人们热烈找窍门的时候，冶炼厂的领导同志，已经在酝酿如何合理使用企业基金；满足工人、家属的迫切要求，拟制切合实际的集体福利事业计划。并已经着手从事细致的准备工作。行政首先根据今年工人计划给国家生产的财富总值，算出企业基金总数。再按照高岗主席的指示，用在集体福利事业上百分之四十五的企业基金，与去年的结余加在一起，今年有十三亿五千万元用来改善集体福利事业。接着，工会便深入各车间、家属住宅区，广泛地搜集工人、家属的要求和意见。行政与工会共同研究了群众提出的三百多件提案，充分估计十三亿五千万元能起的作用，提出今年十大项集体福利事业计划。党委书记、厂长、工会主席、青年团书记，又亲自领导二十名有关干部，访问八处家属住宅区、两处工人独身宿舍，细心对照领导提出的计划是否与群众要求吻合。领导上又把已经拟制好了的“我们有多少钱，准备作哪些事”这样细致的计划，交给工人、家属讨论。最后在职工代表大会上通过集体福利事业计划，这就是合同的第五部分在发展生产增加国家财富的基础上，改善职工福利事业的具体内容。
    总之，在增产节约运动初期，冶炼厂党、行政、工会、青年团领导全厂职工，制订的一系列具体措施计划，如推广先进经验计划，保安措施计划，技术组织措施计划，集体福利事业计划等，就是构成一九五二年下半年集体合同各项内容的基础。从这里可以看出，冶炼厂不是把签订集体合同作为一件孤立的工作任务进行的。而是把集体合同作为组织生产的一个有效手段，通过合同把前一阶段的工作综合起来，固定起来，作为全厂超计划完成增产节约十一万多吨粮食的组织计划，行动纲领。
    通过订合同，发现过去缺点，推动下一步工作
    因此合同也就成了一面镜子，反映出过去的工作全貌，从中发现了缺点。如表现在合同草案上，提高产品质量这一项主要内容，只是几个抽象数字指标，缺乏保证这些数字付诸实现的具体措施。从而暴露了提高产品质量这一工作，在冶炼厂已经作过的一系列工作中，还是比较薄弱的一环。这就使得领导上能及时地发现问题，在发动职工讨论合同草案时，明确提出以深入质量补课作为讨论合同主要内容，集中力量领导质量补课运动。在讨论中，反射炉车间党支部首先研究情况，由车间主任等领导干部带头检讨，带动近二分之一的工人，检查了忽视质量思想。经过这次讨论，在领导干部中、在职工中揭发了不重视质量的自满思想。使干部与职工认清提高质量是当前工作中主要问题。给改进产品质量开辟了道路。最后，在成文的集体合同里，提高质量这一主要内容，已经作为在增产节约运动中必须贯彻的一项方针提出。
    集体合同是组织生产的有效手段，冶炼厂签订一九五二年下半年集体合同，创造了使用集体合同组织生产的先例。    （王殿学）
