    The Happiness of Youth
    Feng Zhi
    One day, a second-year female high school student told me about the situation of her classmates. She said: "There are forty-odd students in our class, and everyone has conscientiously coordinated with the needs of the motherland to determine their future aspirations: some want to study geology, some want to study aviation, some want to study architecture, some want to study hydroelectric power, some want to become people's teachers in the future, some want to become actors, and some want to engage in maternal and child health care...Those with similar aspirations have formed groups to study together outside of class. Each of us is loyal to our own ideals and respects the ideals of others, and we care for others and ourselves equally. For example, my aspiration is aviation, and one day when I checked my eyesight, it showed a tendency to become nearsighted. Nearsightedness is very detrimental to aviation. I was very sad at the time, and all the classmates came to comfort me. They tried every means to protect my eyes, as if they were protecting a pair of eyes that belonged to everyone. When playing volleyball, they didn't let me stand in the team facing the sunlight, fearing that the strong sunlight would harm my eyes. There is no geology class in the school, so we collect minerals everywhere for the geology group to study. For those who want to become actors, we pay attention to their words and deeds, and always remind them of the noble qualities that a people's actor should have. Those who want to study architecture have already started learning design, and recently she designed a theater for our future actor. If anyone makes a mistake, everyone regards this mistake as a major thing that everyone must share, and we discuss together how to correct this mistake..."
    As she spoke, she had infinite love for today and was full of confidence in tomorrow. She believed that none of these aspirations were unattainable; the only problem was her own effort. Her heart was as open as a clear sky, and she could not see anything that would hinder her.
    People have always regarded youth as the most beautiful and most enviable period in a person's life. But only the youth living in today's New China are truly worthy of being envied. The situation of this class of high school students is something that not only middle-aged people like me could not dream of when we were in middle school, but even college juniors and seniors today would not have imagined it when they were in middle school. This is the happiness of the youth of the People's Republic of China: the Party, the Youth League, and the school are educating them; domestic and Soviet readings, and the countless heroic deeds from the Tibetan Plateau to the Korean front are inspiring them, giving them the morality that the people of the most progressive country in the world should have. They feel that the individual is connected to the motherland by blood and that individual happiness and the happiness of the motherland are permanently consistent. When they determine their aspirations, they think about how to make the motherland more and more beautiful every day; when they correct their mistakes, they think about not bringing losses to the motherland.
    Their love for the motherland is inseparable from the motherland's love for them. In order to enable high school graduates across the country to have the opportunity to enter institutions of higher learning, the People's Government, in addition to expanding the enrollment of colleges and universities, has also specially established seventy-eight examination areas across the country this year to provide as much convenience as possible for young people taking the exams. For those in remote areas, travel expenses are also subsidized. Once admitted to institutions of higher learning, the government regards them as valuable cadres, issuing food allowances and living subsidies, so that they are completely relieved of worries about life. As for the distribution of work for college graduates, as indicated in the State Council's instructions, it not only takes care of the living problems of some people, but also takes care of the special aspirations and interests of a few, allowing everyone to exert their strength in their work. These measures are even more unimaginable in any era in the past. In such a situation, who would feel that their personal interests are inconsistent with the interests of the motherland? Who would only care about themselves and not care about the future of the motherland? Because no matter how well you can plan for yourself, it is not as good as a prosperous and strong motherland being able to solve more problems for you. In the old society of the past, there were many young people who were good at planning for themselves, but they often failed to enter institutions of higher learning for several years after graduating from high school; they finally managed to enter a school, but dropped out halfway due to lack of food and clothing; they finally managed to graduate, but could not find a job...
    The current youth, as that high school student said, do not plan for themselves, but are so happy, mainly because they realize that they live in an increasingly prosperous and progressive country, and the government is their parents, but even more reliable than any pair of parents. Therefore, our youth are growing healthily under the care of the government, and their growth is often beyond our expectations, like crops in the hot summer, changing every day. If we walk into the fields at noon, we can not only see that the sorghum and corn are growing all the time under the heat of the sun, but also hear the crisp sounds they make when they grow.

    青年的幸福
    冯至
    一天，一个女高中二年级的学生向我谈起她班里同学们的情形。她说：“我们班里有四十来个同学，人人都很认真配合着祖国的需要规定了自己将来的志愿：有要学地质的，有要学航空的，有要学建筑的，有要学水力发电的，有的想将来当人民教师，有的想当演员，有的要从事妇婴保健工作……。志愿性质相近的，成立了小组，在课外共同学习。我们每个人都忠实于自己的理想，也尊重别人的理想，并且对别人和对自己一样的关怀。例如，我的志愿是航空，一天我检验目光，有变成近视的趋势。近视对于航空是很不利的，当时我很难过，全班的同学都来安慰我，她们想尽方法保护我的眼睛，好像保护大家共同的一对眼睛。打排球时，她们不让我站在面向日光的队伍里，怕强烈的日光对我的眼睛有害。学校里没有地质课，我们到处给地质小组搜集矿石，供她们研究。对于要当演员的，我们注意她的言谈举动，随时都提醒她作一个人民演员应该有怎样崇高的品质。想学建筑的已经起始学习设计，最近她曾经给我们那个未来的演员设计了一座剧院。谁若是犯了错误，大家就把这错误当作一件人人都要分担的重大的事，共同讨论怎样纠正这个错误……”
    她说的时候，对今天有无限的喜爱，对明天充满了信心。她认为这些志愿没有一个是不能达到的，问题只在于自己的努力。她的心像万里晴空一样地开朗，看不见任何一件东西会阻碍她。
    人们一向把青年期看作人一生中最美好、最值得被羡慕的时期。但是只有生活在现在的新中国的青年，才真正值得被人羡慕。像这一班中学生的情形，不只是我这样的中年人在中学的时候作梦也梦不到，就是现在大学三四年级的学生，他们在中学时也不会想像得到。这是中华人民共和国的青年的幸福：党、团和学校在教育他们，国内的和苏联的读物，从西藏高原到朝鲜前线的无数英雄事迹在启发他们，使他们具有世界上最进步的国家里的人民应有的道德。他们感到个人和祖国的血肉相连，个人幸福和祖国幸福的永久一致。他们规定志愿时，就想到怎样使祖国一天比一天地变得更为美好；他们在纠正错误时，就想到千万不要给祖国带来损失。
    他们这样爱祖国，是和祖国对他们的爱护分不开的。人民政府为了使全国高中毕业生都能得到升入高等学校的机会，除扩大高等学校的招生名额外，今年还特别在全国各地设立了七十八个考区，尽量给投考的青年以方便。对于地方僻远的，还补助路费。入了高等学校，政府便把他们看成宝贵的干部，发给伙食费和生活津贴，使他们完全解除了生活上的顾虑。至于高等学校毕业生工作的分配，像政务院指示的几点，不只照顾一部分人生活的问题，而且还照顾了少数人的特殊的志愿与兴趣，让每个人都能在他的工作上发挥他的力量。这些措施更不是在过去任何一个时代所能想像的。在这样情形下，谁还会感到个人的利益和祖国的利益不一致呢？谁还会只顾自己不顾祖国的前途呢？因为你无论如何能为自己打算，也不如一个富强的祖国能够给你解决更多的问题。过去的旧社会里有过许多善于给自己打算的青年，但是他们仍然是常常在高中毕业后几年都考不进高等学校去；好容易考入一个学校，又因为衣食无着而又中途退学；好容易熬到毕业，却又找不到一个职业……。
    现在的青年，像那个高中学生所说的，不为个人打算，而是那样快乐、幸福，主要的原因是他们意识到他们生活在一个日益富强的进步国家里，政府是他们的父母，可是比任何一对父母都更为可靠。所以我们的青年在政府的爱护下只是健壮地生长，他们生长的迅速往往超出我们的意料，这像是盛暑中的庄稼，一天变一个样子。若是我们中午走到田间，我们不只看得出那些高粱、玉蜀黍在日光的热力下时时刻刻都在生长，而且还听得出它们生长时发出的清脆的声音。
