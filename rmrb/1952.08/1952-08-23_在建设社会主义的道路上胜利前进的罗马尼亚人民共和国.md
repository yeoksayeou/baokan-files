Romania Advances Victoriously on the Road to Building Socialism

August 23rd is the eighth anniversary of the liberation of the People's Republic of Romania. The Romanian people will enthusiastically celebrate their great holiday and review the tremendous achievements they have made in politics, economy, and culture since the founding of their country.

Eight years ago, the Soviet army liberated Romania from the enslavement of Hitlerite fascists, opening the way for the Romanian people to strive for complete liberation and move towards socialism. On August 23, 1944, the Romanian working class and laboring people, under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, overthrew the fascist regime of Antonescu. The Romanian army turned its guns around and fought side by side with the great Soviet army against the Hitlerite fascist invading army.

In the eight years since liberation, the Romanian people have achieved many important successes in socialist construction. On June 11, 1948, the government announced the nationalization decree, nationalizing all large industries, mines, banks, insurance, and transportation enterprises. This measure made it possible for Romania to implement a planned economy, eliminate economic crises, and guarantee the continuous rise in the living standards of the working people.

The successful completion of the 1949-1950 national economic plan created the necessary foundation for the People's Republic of Romania to implement its first Five-Year Plan and Ten-Year Electrification Plan. After the completion of the Five-Year Plan, Romania will be transformed from a backward agricultural country before the war into an industrial country.

In the four years since the nationalization of large industries, mines, banks, insurance, and transportation enterprises, industrial production has tripled. The manufacturing of the means of production accounts for 54.4 percent of the total industrial production. The Ten-Year Electrification Plan proposed and formulated by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej is being successfully implemented. The Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej Power Station in Doicești, the largest power center in the country, has been completed and began supplying electricity to industrial enterprises in Bucharest, Stalin City, and other places in early August. The large-scale construction projects such as the "Ovidiu II" Power Station on the Danube-Black Sea Canal and the Moroeni Power Station will also be completed this year.

Large-scale socialist construction projects, such as the Danube-Black Sea Canal, the Lenin Hydropower Station, and the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej Steel Plant, are proceeding smoothly and rapidly. The "Spark Building," the printing and publishing center of Romania, partially opened in 1951.

Due to all these achievements, Romania's industry accounted for 60.4 percent of the total national production by 1951.

The Soviet Union's selfless assistance to Romania is an important factor in the Romanian people's achievements in construction. Romania has received important industrial raw materials and excellent industrial equipment from the Soviet Union, and has learned advanced Soviet technology and experience. This has enabled the Romanian working people to continuously improve their technology and improve the quality of their products during construction. Tens of thousands of Romanian workers have been involved in the Stakhanov movement, which increased labor productivity.

In agriculture, the Romanian people have also made significant progress. The socialist component in agriculture was expanded and strengthened in 1951. New farming methods have been promoted on a larger scale. The cultivated area increased by 130,000 hectares compared to 1950, and the harvest of crops increased by 20 percent compared to 1950. The harvest of collective farms increased by one to two times the total harvest of individual farmers. In 1951, fifty new machine tractor stations were established. The superiority of agricultural collectivization and mechanization has led many farmers to establish more collective farms on a voluntary basis. There are now more than 1,400 such collective farms.

The development of Romania's economy and the increase in labor productivity led to currency reform and price reductions in early 1952. Due to the price reductions, the purchasing power of wage earners increased by 10 billion old lei (lei is the name of Romanian currency), which is 500 million new lei. The large appropriation for social, cultural, and educational undertakings in the 1952 state budget also directly increased the welfare of the working people. This appropriation accounts for 17.5 percent of the total budget expenditure, an increase of 19.5 percent over last year. In 1951, Romania's national income increased by 32 percent compared to the previous year.

Important achievements have also been made in culture. The illiteracy left over from the past will be completely eliminated during the Five-Year Plan. Education has been greatly developed. In 1951, the number of students in higher and secondary schools had increased fourfold compared to 1938.

The draft constitution of the People's Republic of Romania, submitted by Romanian leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej to the Constitution Drafting Committee, fully reflects the tremendous achievements made by the Romanian people. The publication of the draft new constitution makes this year's anniversary of liberation even more significant.

Since Romania implemented the nationalization decree in 1948, socialist industry, the socialist component in agriculture, and socialist commerce have all developed greatly; the people's congresses, as local organs of state power, have been universally established throughout the country. These enormous changes in all aspects of political, economic, and social life have made it necessary to formulate a new constitution.

The basic rights and obligations of citizens—the right to work, the right to rest, the right to education, the complete equality of all nationalities, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of demonstration and procession, freedom of association, and freedom of belief, etc.—are not only specifically stipulated in the constitution, but are also fully guaranteed in actual life.

Under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the Romanian people are working hard to build socialism with full confidence. Their creative labor and the tremendous achievements they are constantly making are a major contribution to the world peace and democracy camp.

### 在建设社会主义的道路上胜利前进的罗马尼亚人民共和国

    在建设社会主义的道路上胜利前进的罗马尼亚人民共和国
    八月二十三日是罗马尼亚人民共和国解放八周年纪念日。罗马尼亚全国人民都要热烈地庆祝他们自己的伟大节日，并检阅他们在建国以来在政治、经济和文化等方面所获得的巨大成就。
    八年以前，苏联军队从希特勒法西斯的奴役之下解放了罗马尼亚，为罗马尼亚人民打开了争取彻底解放与走向社会主义的道路。一九四四年八月二十三日，罗马尼亚工人阶级和劳动人民在罗马尼亚共产党的领导下，推翻了安东尼斯古的法西斯政权。罗马尼亚军队掉转了枪口，和伟大的苏军并肩作战，反对希特勒法西斯侵略军。
    解放以后的八年来，罗马尼亚人民在社会主义建设中已获得了许多重要的成就。一九四八年六月十一日，政府宣布了国有化法令，把一切大工业、矿山、银行、保险与运输事业都收归国有。这一措施，使罗马尼亚实行计划经济，消灭经济危机，与保证劳动人民生活水平不断上升有了可能。
    一九四九年—一九五○年的国民经济计划的顺利完成，为罗马尼亚人民共和国实行第一个五年计划与十年电气化计划创造了必要的基础。五年计划完成以后，罗马尼亚将从战前的落后的农业国转变成为一个工业国。
    自从大工业、矿山、银行、保险与运输事业国有化以后的四年来，工业生产已增加了三倍，在整个工业生产中，制造生产手段的工业占百分之五十四点四。由乔治乌—德治同志所提议与制订的十年电气化计划，正在顺利地执行着。在多塞希蒂的乔治乌—德治电力站，全国最大的电力中心，已经建设完成，并于八月初开始对布加勒斯特各工业企业、斯大林城等地供应电力。在多瑙河—黑海运河畔的“奥维迪乌第二”电力站、莫罗依尼电力站等巨大的建设工程也将在今年完工。
    规模巨大的社会主义建设工程，如多瑙河—黑海运河，列宁水力发电站、乔治乌—德治钢铁厂等正在顺利而迅速地进行着。罗马尼亚的印刷出版中心“火花大厦”，在一九五一年就已经部分开工了。
    由于这一切成就，罗马尼亚的工业到一九五一年为止，就已占全国总生产量的百分之六十点四了。
    苏联对于罗马尼亚的大公无私的援助，是罗马尼亚人民在建设中获得这些成就的重要因素。罗马尼亚从苏联得到了重要的工业原料与优良的工业装备，并学习了苏联先进的技术与经验。这使得罗马尼亚劳动人民在建设中不断地改进自己的技术并提高了产品的质量。成千成万的罗马尼亚工人卷入了斯塔哈诺夫运动中，提高了劳动生产率。
    在农业方面，罗马尼亚人民也获得了显著的进展。农业中的社会主义成分在一九五一年是扩大与加强了。新的农作方法有了更大规模的推广。耕地面积比一九五零年增加了十三万公顷，农作物的收获量比一九五零年增加了百分之二十。集体农场的收获量比个体农民收获量的总数增加了一倍到两倍。一九五一年，建立了五十个新的机器拖拉机站。农业集体化与机械化的优越性，使许多农民们在自愿基础上成立了更多的集体农庄。现在这种集体农庄已达一千四百多个。
    罗马尼亚经济的发展和劳动生产率的提高，促成了在一九五二年年初的货币改革和减低物价。由于物价的减低，工资收入者的购买力提高了一百亿旧列伊（列伊是罗马尼亚的货币名），也就是五亿的新列伊。一九五二年国家预算中对于社会文教事业的大量拨款，也直接地增进了劳动人民的福利。这方面的拨款占预算总支出的百分之十七点五，比去年增加了百分之十九点五。一九五一年，罗马尼亚的国民收入比上一年增加了百分之三十
    二。
    在文化方面，也获得了重要的成就。过去遗留下来的文盲，将在五年计划中被彻底扫除。教育事业已有极大的发展。在一九五一年，高等与中等学校的学生人数已比一九三八年增加了四倍。
    由罗马尼亚人民领袖乔治乌—德治提交给宪法草案制订委员会的罗马尼亚人民共和国新宪法草案，充分反映了罗马尼亚人民所获得的巨大成就。新宪法草案的公布，使罗马尼亚今年的解放纪念日具有更为重大的意义。
    自从罗马尼亚于一九四八年实行国有化法令以来，社会主义工业、农业中的社会主义成分以及社会主义的商业都有了极大的发展；作为国家政权的地方机构的人民会议已在全国各地普遍建立起来。这种在政治、经济与社会生活各方面所发生的巨大变化，已经使得制订新宪法成为必要。
    公民的基本权利与义务—工作权、休息权、受教育权、各民族的完全平等、新闻自由、集会自由、示威游行自由、结社与信仰自由等等，不但在宪法中具体地规定着，而且在实际生活中获得了完全的保证。
    在罗马尼亚工人党与乔治乌—德治同志的领导之下，罗马尼亚人民正在满怀信心地努力建设着社会主义。他们的创造性劳动与不断获得的巨大成就，是对于世界和平民主阵营的重大贡献。
