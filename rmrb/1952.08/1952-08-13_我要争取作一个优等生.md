    I Want to Strive to Be an Excellent Student
    Editor: I am Song Shiku, the son of revolutionary martyr Song Xuancai from Duanwang Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province. My father was originally a regimental commander in a certain unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region. After fighting the enemy for more than ten years, he gloriously sacrificed himself in a certain battle in 1948. After that, my family only had my grandparents, who were in their seventies, and my mother, who was in her fifties. Although they both participated in labor, life was relatively difficult. However, thanks to the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government, my family's difficulties were overcome, and we could even eat pork and white flour during festivals. In addition, the People's Government also gives me a people's subsidy of 110 catties of rice per month, which allowed me to attend middle school. Now, my life is very happy: I have no problems with food and clothing, and I study, sing, and dance with my classmates every day. How happy I am!
    I know that Chairman Mao gave me this happy life. I am determined to study hard to repay Chairman Mao. This semester, my average grade is more than 85 points. Next semester, I will strive for an average of more than 90 points and become an excellent student. I am determined to inherit my father's revolutionary spirit and prepare to serve the construction of our great motherland to the end.

    我要争取作一个优等生
    编辑同志：我是河北省满城县段旺村革命烈士宋选才的儿子。我父亲原是晋察冀军区某部的团长，他在和敌人搏斗了十多年之后，于一九四八年在某次战役中光荣牺牲了。那以后，我家中只有七十多岁的祖父母和五十多岁的母亲，他们虽然都参加劳动，但生活是比较困难的。可是，由于共产党、人民政府的照顾，我家的生活困难克服了，逢年过节还可以吃上猪肉、白面。另外，人民政府每月还发给我一百一十斤米的人民助学金，使我上了中学。现在，我的生活很美满：吃、穿不成问题，每天和同学们一起学习、唱歌、跳舞。我是多么幸福啊！
    我知道，幸福日子是毛主席给我的。我决心好好学习来报答毛主席。这学期，我的学习成绩平均是八十五分多，下学期我要争取平均九十分以上，成为优等生。我决心继承我父亲的革命精神，准备为伟大祖国的建设而服务到底。
