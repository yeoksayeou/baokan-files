    An Old Cadre's Experience of Rapid Literacy Learning
    Li Zhankui, spoken; Li Yingcai, recorded

    My name is Li Zhankui. My mother died when I was seven, and at eleven I became a cowherd for a landlord. When I got a bit older, I did odd jobs. I was constantly beaten and scolded, a child no one cared for. In 1933, I joined the Red Army. Later, I followed the troops north to resist Japan. I was wounded in the Battle of Pingxingguan and transferred to the headquarters of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region as an administrator. At that time, a cultural learning movement was launched in the organization. I thought that as long as I made sure the comrades had enough to eat and wear, worked hard, maintained close ties with the masses, and was loyal to the Party and the people, I was a good administrator, and there was no need to learn culture. Instead of learning culture, it would be better to let me carry a manure basket, collect some fertilizer, and plant some pumpkins for the comrades to eat. Moreover, the pumpkin pulp could be used to feed pigs, and when the pigs grew fat, there would be pork to improve our food. Wouldn't that be better than learning culture? So, I emphasized that I was busy with work and didn't study.
    In 1949, I went to Taiyuan to participate in the takeover work, serving as the chief of the General Affairs Section of the Public Security Bureau. After the takeover work was completed, the director of the bureau mobilized everyone to learn culture at a cadre meeting. He said, "Without culture, you can't get ahead now, and you won't be able to get ahead in the future." I didn't agree with this at all. I thought, "How can I not get ahead? When I came, the General Affairs Section didn't even have window paper, but now the warehouse is full. Doesn't it still work without culture?" At the time, I thought, "Even if I can't be a section chief without culture, can't I still be a platoon leader or a soldier?" But the director then said:
    "In the future, without a junior high school education, you won't even be able to be a policeman." When I heard this, I got angry and thought, "Okay, if I can't be a section chief, I can't even be a policeman! If I can't get ahead without culture, then I won't get ahead." I felt that in the past twenty years or so, I had been holding a gun, fighting the enemy to the death in the front lines. Even if I had no merit, I had toiled hard. Now, because I had no culture, I couldn't get ahead. I became emotional, and my health deteriorated day by day. After returning to Beijing, I repeatedly requested the organization to transfer me to the Korean front lines. I figured, "Without culture, I can still hold a gun and fight the American devils to the death." But the organization, in order to take care of my health, did not approve it.
    In Beijing, I ran into many old comrades-in-arms. As soon as they met me, they asked, "Old Li, how is your cultural learning going?" I said, "Almost there." But how "almost" was it? I knew in my own heart: "Very far." One day, I went to the higher authorities to discuss work and encountered a problem at the reception desk as soon as I entered the door. They asked me to fill out a "Visitor Registration Form." When I looked at it, I was completely baffled. I had a pen in my pocket, but I hadn't filled it with ink in three years. I couldn't write. Holding the pen, I was embarrassed and flustered, and finally had to ask someone else to write it for me. At this moment, I truly realized the correctness of the director's words: without culture, you really can't get ahead. If I couldn't handle such a small matter, the difficulties would be unimaginable if I were to become a leading cadre in the future. I remembered what Chairman Mao said in Yan'an: "Intellectuals must become workers and peasants, and workers and peasants must become intellectuals." Many intellectuals have become workers and peasants, so why can't I, a worker and peasant cadre, become intellectualized? In the past, I was needed to hold a gun and fight the enemy to the death, but now I am not needed in the front lines. I am participating in the industrial construction of the rear, so I should pick up a pen. I must make up my mind to learn culture, and I shouldn't keep saying "almost there."
    Just at this time, the Beijing Second District Cadre Rapid Literacy Class opened. The organization asked me to participate in the study. When I heard that I could recognize thousands of characters in three months and be able to write letters, read newspapers, and keep a diary, I thought it was really a good thing, and I could get rid of my burden. But I also thought, in the past, many old comrades studied in cultural schools for many years, and what they wrote was still sloppy. Elementary school students study for five or six years, and it's still not very effective. Only three months, and only two hours of study each day, and I am old. Can I really learn it? So, I asked around, and the answers were all the same: "It's really fast." If you said you didn't believe it, that's what everyone said. If you believed it, you were afraid it wasn't true. So, I took a try-it-and-see attitude to see what kind of method it was and whether it was effective.
    Finally, I entered the school gate and began to learn culture. This was a great joy for me in over forty years. On the day the school held a mobilization meeting, I went happily. Before leaving, I heard the workers discussing behind my back: "Section Chief Li is so old, why is he still learning culture?" When I heard this, I felt a surge of energy. I went to the barbershop, shaved off my mustache, and shaved my face clean before going to the meeting place. The meeting place was very lively. Students from the sanitation team and the clothing factory workers' class were also participating. The teachers put a big red flower on me. I sat there and listened to two reports: Li Shengguan, a 47-year-old sanitation worker, described how he had mastered ninety new characters on the first day and one hundred and twenty characters on the second day. Wang Mingshang, a sanitation worker, said that he originally didn't believe in rapid literacy at all. He only recognized four or five hundred characters in the past, but after a rapid boost, he recognized more than sixteen hundred. At this point, I felt much brighter. If people older than me could learn it, why couldn't I? At this time, the leaders of our organization assured us on the spot that the leadership would definitely give strong support to ensure that everyone could complete the learning tasks. I couldn't sit still any longer and went to the stage to speak. I said: "In the past, I have always been semi-illiterate, not knowing many characters. Now I want to improve to the level of junior high school in three months. This is really something I never dreamed of. I can't let go of this opportunity. Our leader is sixty-eight years old and is still actively serving the people. I am only forty-one years old this year. If I learn culture well, I can at least be a servant of the people for twenty more years. I will definitely make up my mind to learn and complete this study as a political task."
    School started on June 18th. The first lesson was learning phonetic symbols. When I looked at them, these letters looked like characters and yet didn't. I thought, I can't even figure out Chinese characters, what's the point of learning foreign letters? The teacher read the thirty-seven letters on the stage. When I listened, some sounds came from the nose, some from the throat, and some from the curled tongue. I had stayed in the mountains for so many years and had never even heard of them. I didn't know how to pronounce them. Later, the teacher said, "If you learn these thirty-seven letters, you can recognize any character." So I made up my mind to pronounce them diligently. I didn't expect to learn them after a while.
    Soon after, we started learning pinyin. I saw that some of the double pinyin tables were written in red and some in blue. Others said, "Red characters are Chinese sounds, and the stress should be separated when spelling." I thought that red characters were male sounds and blue characters must be female sounds; so the Chinese sounds had to be stronger and the female sounds had to be lighter. But after spelling for a long time, I couldn't spell them correctly. After the teacher found out, she told me, "No, you're wrong. The Chinese sound represents the sound of all Chinese characters, not the sound of men; when spelling, the first sound should be light and short and the second sound should be heavy, not the first sound heavy and the second sound light." She taught me several times, and I understood its spirit and was able to spell the sounds smoothly.
    Later, we crammed new characters. I was always afraid to confirm the sounds I spelled out. For example, the character "花" (hua, flower), I kept pronouncing it as "ㄏ—ㄨ—ㄚ, ㄏ—ㄨ—ㄚ". Others couldn't hear that it was the sound of "花" and thought it was some other sound. With the help of comrades in the group, I realized that when spelling a character, I had to be calm and look at the letters and the shape of the character at the same time; when spelling, avoid roundabout routes, and be steady and accurate, and also pay attention with your eyes, mouth, heart, and hands, so that the sound will come out naturally.
    After cramming the new characters, we entered the reading stage. I was very enthusiastic. When I read the lesson on "Means of Transportation": "On land there are trains, in the sea there are ships, and in the air there are airplanes." I was stumped by the "troublesome" character "飞" (fei, fly). I didn't recognize it at first, but I knew as soon as I read it that it was the character "飞", because there are only things that can fly in the air, such as airplanes. The sentences are smooth from top to bottom, and you can read the sound of the character; but you have to be careful and not read blindly, "smooth" while looking at the shape of the character, paying attention to its radicals, shape, and meaning. After reading it several times, you can naturally eliminate the "troublesome" character.
    Then, while reading, I practiced writing. I had never written before, and I would break out in a sweat as soon as I picked up a pen. The first time I wrote, I wrote less than twenty characters in total, but I broke several pencils. Later, I continued to write for a few days and gradually became proficient. I thought to myself: "Before I started writing, I felt it was difficult, but it's not that hard when I start writing." When I started writing, I didn't look at one stroke and write one stroke, but looked at one radical and wrote one radical. For example, the radical 牜 or the radical 金, I can write them down after one glance. Some characters are often composed of several characters, and I can write them down after looking at them at most three times; even if it is a troublesome character, I will become familiar with it after writing it a few times.
    Next was copying the new word list. I connected it with my own thoughts, pondered the meaning of each word, and practiced writing. I rewrote the new words "Comrades are in class to learn culture and do work" as "Comrades are in class to learn good culture, do good work, not afraid of many difficulties, practice well and serve the people to the end." The teacher pointed out that this method was good, as it practiced copying and also practiced writing sentences. Later, our group all started doing this.
    Now, we are conducting close reading and detailed explanation. One day, when I read the lesson "The Last Party Membership Fee," I was so moved that I shed tears. I remembered many old comrades-in-arms in the past who were unyielding under the enemy's bayonets and demonstrated the noblest qualities of a Communist Party member. In the last second before their death, they were still thinking about the Party and the unfinished work.
    Our learning is about to enter the writing and composition stage. I believe that as long as I connect it with my past struggle experiences and apply the new characters I have learned to practical life, the difficulties in writing can also be overcome.
    Now I have learned to recognize one thousand eight hundred new characters, can read the Worker's Daily, can write notes, and will soon be preparing to write a work diary.

    一个老干部学习速成识字的经过
    李占魁　讲  李英才　记
    我叫李占魁，七岁上死了娘，十一岁给地主当牛倌，稍大一点就扛零活；成天挨打受骂，从小就是个狼不吃狗不啃的孩子。一九三三年，我参加了红军；后来随着队伍北上抗日，在平型关战斗中我挂了花，转到晋察冀军区司令部当管理员。这时机关里头开展文化学习运动，我认为只要让同志们能吃的上穿的上，自己埋头苦干，联系群众，对党对人民忠实，就是个好管理员，用不着学文化。与其学文化，还不如让我背上粪筐，拾两泡粪，种上些北瓜，让同志们吃吃，而且瓜瓤子还可以喂猪，猪长肥了还有猪肉吃，改善伙食，这岂不比学文化强吗？所以就强调工作忙，没有学。
    一九四九年，我到太原去参加接管工作，担任公安厅总务科长；待接管工作告一段落，厅长就在干部会上动员大家学文化。他说：“没有文化，现在吃不开，将来也吃不开。”我听了大不以为然。心里说：“怎么吃不开？我来的时候，总务科连个窗户纸都没有，现在仓库里堆得满满的，没文化不还是照样行。”当时认为：“没文化就算科长当不了，还不是可以当排长当战士？”可是厅长接着又说：
    “将来没有高小文化程度，连个警察都当不了。”我一听就火了，心里说：“好，科长当不了，连个警察也当不了啦！”“没文化吃不开，不吃算了。”我觉得我在过去二十来年中拿着枪杆子，在前方和敌人拚死拚活，没有功劳，也有苦劳；现在没文化，反而吃不开了。心里闹起情绪，身体就一天比一天瘦下来了。回到北京，三番五次请求组织调我到朝鲜前线去。我自己盘算着：“没文化，照样能拿枪杆子和美国鬼子拚命。”但组织上为了照顾我的身体，没有批准。
    在北京碰见不少过去的老战友，一见面人家都问我：“老李，文化学得怎么样了？”我说：“差不多了。”实际上究竟“差多少？”我自己心里明白：“差的很远。”有一天，到上级机关去谈工作，一进门就在传达室碰上难题了。人家让我填“来客登记表”，我一瞧，“外国人看戏，霎眼啦。”我衣袋里插着钢笔，可是三年没怎么灌过墨水，我写不了字。当时拿着笔，别的我脸红脖子粗，到底还是让别人替我写了。这时候，我才真正体会到厅长的话的正确，没文化确实是吃不开了。这么点小事办不了，以后要是做个领导干部，那困难就不用提了。我想起毛主席在延安说过的话：“知识分子要工农化，工农分子要知识化”，有不少知识分子都工农化了，我这个工农干部，为什么还不能知识化呢？过去需要我拿枪杆子和敌人拚死拚活，现在不需要我到前方，我参加了后方的工业建设，就应该拿笔杆子了，我要下决心学文化，不应该老一个劲儿“差不多”了。
    正好这时候，北京市第二区干部速成识字法实验班开班了。组织上让我参加学习。我一听，三个月就能认识几千字，还能写信看报记日记，这可真是个好事，自己的包袱也可以卸下来了。可是心里又想，过去许多老同志，在文化学校学习好几年，写个什么还是稀松二五眼；小学生念五六年书，还不顶什么事，这才三个月，又是每天两小时学习，自己岁数大了，还能学会吗？我便到处打听，回答都是一致的：“就是快。”你说不信吧，人家都这么说。信吧，又恐怕真不保险，所以我就抱着试试看的态度，看看究竟是什么法子，灵不灵？
    我终于进了学堂门，开始学文化。这是我四十多年来的一件大喜事。学校召开动员大会的那一天，我高高兴兴地去了。临走时听见工友们在背地里议论：“李科长这么大的岁数，还学什么文化？”我一听，心里别着一股劲，出了门就到理发馆，把小胡子一剃，把脸刮得净光，就到会场去了。会场里可真热闹，清洁队和被服厂工人班的学员都参加了。老师们给我带上一朵大红花，我坐在那儿，听了两个报告：四十七岁的清洁队工人李生成，叙述了第一天突击了九十个生字、第二天突击了一百二十个字的经过。清洁队工人王铭尚说，他原是一个根本不信速成识字法的人，过去只认识四五百字，经过突击一下认识了一千六百多。这一下，我心里可就豁亮多了。比我岁数大的人都能学会，我自己又为什么不能学会呢？这时候我们机关的首长当场向我们保证：领导上绝对大力支持，保证大家能完成学习任务。我再也坐不住了，跑到台上讲了话。我说：“过去，我一直是个半文盲，认不得几个字。如今我要在三个月里提高到高小程度，这可真是做梦也想不到的事。我不能放过这个机会。我们的首长六十八岁了，还在积极为人民服务，我今年才四十一岁，要是把文化学好了，我起码还可以给人民做二十年的勤务员。我一定下决心学，把这次学习当做一个政治任务来完成。”
    六月十八号，学校开学了。头一堂学注音符号。我一看，好家伙，这些字母像字又不像字。心想中国字还闹不清，弄些外国字干什么？老师在台上把三十七个字母念了一遍。我一听，有从鼻子里出来的音，也有从嗓子眼里出来的音，还有从翘起的舌头发出的音。我在山沟里呆了这么多年，连听也没有听过，不知怎么念法。后来老师说：“这三十七个字母学会了，什么字都能认识。”我就下了决心：用劲地念，没想到一会儿就念会了。
    不久，学拼音了。我看见双拼音表上有的写着红字，有的写着蓝字。别人说：“红字是汉字音，拼的时候轻重要分开。”我一想，红字是男子的音，蓝字就一定是女人的音；那么汉字的音就得重些，女人的音就得轻些。可是拼了半天，老拼不好。老师发觉以后告诉我：“不对，你弄错了，汉音是代表中国所有汉字的音，不是男子的音；拼的时候，要前音轻短后音重，不是前音重后音轻。”她教了我几遍，我领会了它的精神，就能顺利地拼音了。
    后来又突击生字，拼出来的音，我老不敢肯定。像“花”字，我一个劲地把它念成“ㄏ—ㄨ—ㄚ，ㄏ—ㄨ—ㄚ”，别人听不出是“花”音，还不是别的什么音。经过小组同志的帮助，我才知道拼一个字，要沉着，一边看字母，一边看字形；拼的时候，切忌拐弯子，要稳要准，还要眼到、口到、心到、手到，这样音就自然而然地发出来了。
    突击完生字，就进入阅读阶段。我的劲头很大，念到“交通工具”那一课：“陆上有火车，海里有轮船，空中有飞机。”我被“飞”这个“捣蛋”字难住了。我原来不认识它，可是我一念就知道这是个“飞”字，因为空中就只有能飞的东西，例如飞机之类。句子上下一顺，就可以读出字音来；不过可得细心，不能瞎念，一边“顺”，一边看字形，注意它的偏旁部首，字形字义，这样多念几遍，自然就可以把“捣蛋”字消灭了。
    随后一边阅读，一边就练习写字了。我过去没写过字，一拿笔杆子就是一头汗。头一回写，总共只写了不到二十个字，铅笔却断了好几截儿。以后我又接着写了几天，就慢慢熟练起来了。我心里想：“没有动手写字以前就感到困难，写起来却又并不算啥。”我一开头写字，不是看一笔写一笔，而是看一个偏旁写一个偏旁。譬如牜或是金旁，我看一眼就能写下来。有的字常常是由几个字组成的，顶多看上三眼就可以写下来；即使是一个捣蛋字，多写它几遍也就熟悉了。
    接着是抄写生字表。我联系自己的思想，琢磨着每一个字的意思练习写，把生字“同志们上课了学好文化做工作”改写成“同志们上课了学习好文化，做好工作，不怕困难多，练习好了向人民服务到底”。老师指出这个法子不错，既练习了抄写，又练习了写话。后来我们这个小组，就都这样做开了。
    现在，我们正在进行精读和精讲。有一天读到“最后一次党费”那一课，我被感动得掉下泪来；我想起了过去的许多老战友，他们在敌人的刺刀下，不屈不挠，表现了共产党员最高贵的品质。他们在临死前一秒钟，还在想念着党，想念着未完的工作。
    我们的学习，就要进入写话和写作阶段。我相信，只要联系自己过去的斗争经验，把学得的生字运用到实际生活中去，写作上的困难是同样可以突破的。
    现在我已经认识一千八百个生字，能看工人日报，能写便条，不久就要准备写工作日记了。
