Question from a reader: Why adjust the People's Bursary for students in national higher education institutions and secondary schools?

Answer: To meet the needs of our country's upcoming large-scale economic construction, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of highly specialized talents and mid-level technical talents. To achieve this goal, many effective measures must be taken. Adjusting the People's Bursary for students in higher education institutions and secondary schools, so that more young people, especially the children of working people, can enter higher and secondary schools to study, is one of many effective measures.

Over the past three years, our country has implemented the People's Bursary system in national higher education institutions and secondary schools, and the fully funded public system in a few schools, in order to cultivate a large number of talents and to enable the children of workers and peasants to have the opportunity to enroll. However, the People's Bursary system and public system implemented in the past had different standards, and the treatment of students of the same level and type of school often varied greatly, which should be adjusted. Due to changes in the composition of students and the increase in the number of students, it is also necessary to adjust the scope of implementation of the People's Bursary.

Earnest implementation of the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Notice on Adjusting the People's Bursary for Students in National Higher Education Institutions and Secondary Schools" will gradually standardize the standards of treatment for students enjoying the People's Bursary, and make the scope of the People's Bursary more in line with actual needs. In the future, students in national higher education institutions, worker-peasant rapid middle schools, secondary vocational schools, secondary normal schools, and worker-peasant rapid primary schools will all implement the People's Bursary system; students in ordinary senior high schools and ordinary junior high schools will partially implement the People's Bursary system. This will inevitably enable a large number of young people, especially young workers and peasants, to enter higher and secondary schools; and encourage more young people to enter vocational schools and normal schools. This is fully in line with the urgent needs of our country's large-scale construction in the future, and provides better material conditions for the majority of students to complete their studies.

    为什么要调整全国高等学校及中等学校学生人民助学金？
    问：为什么要调整全国高等学校及中等学校学生人民助学金？
    答：为了满足我国即将开始的大规模经济建设的需要，必须大量培养足够的高等专门人材和中等技术人材。为了实现这个目的，就必须采取许多有效的措施。调整高等学校和中等学校学生的人民助学金，以便使更多的青年，特别是劳动人民的子女，能够进入高等和中等学校学习，这是许多有效措施中的一种。
    三年以来，我们的国家为了培养大批人材，为了使工农子女获得入学的机会，已在全国高等学校及中等学校中实行了人民助学金制，并在少数学校中实行了全部供给的公费制。但是，过去实行的人民助学金制和公费制，因为标准不同，同级同类学校学生的待遇常有很大差别，这是应该加以调整的。由于学生成份的变化和学生数量的增加，实行人民助学金的范围也有加以调整的必要。
    认真执行中央人民政府政务院“关于调整全国高等学校及中等学校学生人民助学金的通知”，将逐步统一享受人民助学金的学生待遇的标准，并使人民助学金的范围更加符合实际的需要。今后全国高等学校、工农速成中学、中等专业学校、中等师范学校、工农速成初级学校的学生，将要全部实行人民助学金制；普通高级中学和普通初级中学的学生，将要部分实行人民助学金制。这就必然会使大批青年，特别是青年工农群众，得以进入高等和中等学校；并且鼓励更多的青年进入专业学校和师范学校。这完全符合于我国今后大规模建设的迫切需要，使广大学生有更好的物质条件去完成学习任务。
