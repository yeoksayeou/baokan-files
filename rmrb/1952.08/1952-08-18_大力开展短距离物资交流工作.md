    Vigorously Develop Short-Distance Material Exchange Work

    Since the beginning of this year, many large-scale and small-scale material exchange meetings have been held across the country, which has played a significant role in stimulating the market and supporting industrial and agricultural production. At the larger-scale material exchange meetings held in major administrative regions and most provinces and cities, large quantities of local products and industrial goods for long-distance sales were traded, breaking the stalemate of some products. In order to consolidate and develop the achievements of this upper-level exchange and to open up the sales channels for various local and handcrafted products that cannot be sold far away, various regions must further focus on lower-level small-scale material exchange meetings and conduct material exchange more extensively.

    In the past, various regions have put a lot of effort into organizing short-distance material exchanges and have achieved considerable success. This is reflected in the fact that many regions have used short-distance material exchange meetings to sell many small local and special products that were originally stockpiled in the hands of farmers. For example, small-scale exchange meetings in eleven counties such as Pingyang and Wukang in Zhejiang Province opened up the sales of firewood, bamboo, sulfur, straw sandals, clam shells, straw hats and other products that had been slow to sell. At the Danyang exchange meeting in Southern Jiangsu, special local products such as core paper, vermicelli, dates, rain capes, and straw mats were also in high demand. As farmers sold their local products, their purchasing power increased accordingly. At nine temple fairs in Chahar Province, farmers purchased industrial products such as cloth, matches, sugar, and kerosene worth 2.023 billion yuan. At the urban-rural exchange meeting in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, bamboo-shell thermos bottles and high-top rubber shoes were well received by farmers. At the material exchange meetings in Huzhou City and Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, the sales volume of industrial products accounted for 24% of the total transaction volume. At the Lancifeng County Town Material Exchange Meeting in Henan Province, the transaction volume of industrial and handicraft products accounted for 32%. In addition, farmers also purchased large quantities of means of production. For example, farmers in Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, applied 2.6 million catties of bittern crystal last year and purchased 4 million catties this year, an increase of 53.8%; they applied 60,000 catties of chalcanthite gypsum last year and have purchased 420,000 catties this year, an increase of six times over last year. According to incomplete statistics from short-distance exchange meetings in Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, farmers purchased nearly 4,000 head of livestock and more than 90,000 pieces of wooden plows, sickles, mulberry hoes, seeders, hoes, manure forks, and various iron, wooden, and bamboo farm tools. This has powerfully promoted the patriotic production increase movement in rural areas.

    In short-distance material exchanges, many private industrialists and businessmen also actively participated and made a large number of transactions. For example, the total transaction volume of the Zhengzhou Medicinal Materials, Mule and Horse, and General Merchandise Conference in Henan Province was 13.3 billion yuan, of which private merchants accounted for about 75%. At the material exchange meeting jointly held by Huzhou City and Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, the transaction volume of private merchants accounted for 77%; at the material exchange meeting in Jiaxing City and County, private industry and commerce sold 40.24% of the total transaction volume and purchased 72.97% of its transaction volume. At the Kunshan County Material Exchange Meeting in Southern Jiangsu, private enterprises called and wrote letters to invite people to participate in the exchange meeting, and allocated funds to revise the original purchase and sales plans and expand the transaction volume.

    In addition to organizing local materials for exchange, some small-scale exchange meetings in various places have also invited representatives from public and private industrial and commercial enterprises who have dealings with other places to participate, according to the local production and sales situation, to supplement the deficiencies of short-distance material exchanges. The Zhengzhou Medicinal Materials, General Merchandise, Mule and Horse Conference in Henan Province invited the Changsha Industrial and Commercial Delegation of Hunan Province and other units to participate in the exchange. In addition to entrusting the purchase of a large amount of saltpeter, cattail mats, palm bark, gypsum, and other local products at the meeting, the Changsha Industrial and Commercial Delegation also supplied a large amount of cloth, groceries, umbrellas, paper, rosin, palm bark, gypsum, and other local products and industrial products. Through the exchange, public and private trading enterprises in Zhengzhou City restored and newly established 64 trade relationships with nine provinces including Shandong, Shaanxi, and Hunan. In other cases, white sugar produced in the coastal areas of Fujian Province was supplied in large quantities through exchange meetings to meet the needs of the people in the inland areas of Nanping and Jian'ou in the province. Towels, homespun cloth, silk thread and other products produced in Fuzhou City were also sold in large quantities to the rural areas of Yong'an, Fu'an, and Xianyou.

    However, as far as the whole country is concerned, the development of this kind of small-scale material exchange meeting is still very uneven. In order to more extensively carry out material exchanges in small towns and all grassroots markets, and to hold small-scale material exchange meetings well, the leading organs in various regions must summarize and absorb the existing experience. The main experiences of various regions in organizing short-distance material exchanges are as follows:

    1. The Party and the government must attach importance to and strengthen the organizational preparation work before small-scale material exchange meetings, and organize state-owned enterprises, cooperative departments, private industry and commerce, banks, taxation, transportation, culture and education, and other aspects to discuss together. Before the meeting, the industrial and commercial administrative departments should investigate the production and sales of various commodities in the local area, formulate purchase and sales plans, and organize and mobilize various economic forces to vigorously purchase various materials and fully supply the industrial products needed by the masses according to the plans. Wherever the leading organs attach importance to the matter and do a good job in the preparatory work before the meeting, the material exchange meeting will be successful. For example, Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, organized 24 temple fairs before the wheat harvest this year, and investigated the urgent needs of the masses for livestock, agricultural tools, and some light industrial products, so they vigorously organized these commodities. The masses responded very well. A thorough investigation should also be made in advance of the local people's special local products, so as to organize their promotion at the meeting.

    2. The state-owned economy should unite private merchants well and actively participate in short-distance material exchanges. The economic characteristics of private merchants in small towns are that they operate in a decentralized manner and have small capital, but they have close ties with the grassroots market. Therefore, the role of private merchants in small towns in small local product exchange meetings should be brought into play. Various regions should also appropriately grasp regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences to take care of the reasonable profits of private merchants. The State Bank should give strong support in terms of loans and provide convenience in terms of loan procedures to encourage private merchants to operate actively.

    3. It is necessary to attach importance to the business organization and leadership work during the small-scale material exchange meeting. Many people participate in the exchange meeting, with mixed composition, many commodities, and huge quantities. Therefore, there should be leadership, planning, and organized exchanges. In the organization and leadership, we must grasp the following links: (1) Public and private consultations should be carried out, and prices should be clearly marked and broadcast in a timely manner with a loudspeaker to solve the difficulties of illiterate farmers. (2) All arrangements for the meeting should facilitate both buyers and sellers. Various commodities should be classified and displayed, with good and bad clearly distinguished; an exchange (wholesale trading place for public and private enterprises) and a retail market should be set up on the exchange venue to facilitate merchants to purchase and sell commodities. (3) Strengthen market management, ban commercial malpractices, appropriately reduce commissions, and establish a new commercial atmosphere. (4) The transaction methods should be flexible. During the exchange, various forms such as cash on delivery, forward contracts, barter, credit purchase and sale, agency purchase and sale can be adopted;

    (5) Strengthen public security work and establish a good venue order.

    4. Combine small-scale material exchange meetings with cultural and recreational activities. In this way, on the one hand, customers can be attracted, and on the other hand, the educational significance of the material exchange meeting can be strengthened. Through cultural and recreational activities, transform some of the backward aspects of old temple fairs and old market places. For example, in the past, old temple fairs and old market places often had hooligans, gamblers, "magic doctors," and "witches" taking the opportunity to defraud people. This phenomenon must be changed. Various tools of cultural education and recreational activities should be used, such as showing movies and slides, organizing educational dramas, storytelling, and various exhibitions, to carry out activities in order to attract the masses to legitimate demands and interests and improve the masses' level of awareness.

    大力开展短距离物资交流工作
    今年以来，全国各地分别召开了许多大规模的和小规模的物资交流会，这对活跃市场、支持工农业生产，起了重大的作用。在各大行政区及大多数省市所召开的较大规模的物资交流会上，都成交了大宗的、长途远销的土产和工业品，打开了某些产品滞销的局面。为了巩固并发展这种上层交流的成绩，并打开种类繁多、带地方性而不能远销的土产及手工业产品的销路，各地还必须进一步抓紧下层小型的物资交流会，更加广泛地进行物资交流。
    各地为了组织短距离的物资交流，过去曾用了很多力量，并获得了相当的成绩。这表现在不少地区通过短距离物资交流会，使许多原来积压在农民手里的小宗土特产品得到了销路。如浙江平阳、武康等十一个县的小型交流会，打开了滞销的木柴、毛竹、硫磺、草鞋、蜊灰壳、草帽等产品的销路。苏南丹阳交流会上，表蕊纸、粉丝、枣子、蓑衣、草席等土特产也都畅销。农民销出了土特产，购买力随之提高，察哈尔省九个庙会中，农民购买布匹、火柴、糖、煤油等工业品的价值达二十亿零二千三百多万元。河北石家庄城乡交流会上，竹壳暖水瓶、高腰胶鞋都为农民所欢迎。浙江湖州市和吴兴县物资交流会上，工业品销售量占全部成交比重百分之二十四。河南省兰封县城关物资交流会，工业品及手工业品成交比重占百分之三十二。此外，农民还购买了大批生产资料，如浙江诸暨县农民，去年施用卤晶二百六十万斤，今年购进四百万斤，增加百分之五十三点八；去年施用青矾石膏六万斤，今年已购四十二万斤，较去年增加六倍。据平原安阳专区各地短距离交流会的不完全统计，农民购买牲口近四千头，木?、镰刀、桑?、耧、锄、粪?及铁、木、竹各种农具即达九万余件。这就有力地推动了农村的爱国增产运动。
    在短距离物资交流中，不少私营工商业者也积极参加，大量成交。如河南郑州市药材骡马百货大会，总的成交额为一百三十三亿元，其中私商所占比重达百分之七十五左右。浙江湖州市、吴兴县联合举行的物资交流会，私商成交比重占百分之七十七；嘉兴市、县物资交流会，私营工商业销出占总成交百分之四○·二四，购进占其成交额百分之七十二·九七。苏南昆山县物资交流会上，私营企业纷纷打电话和写信约人来参加交流会，并调度资金，重新修订原来购销计划，扩大交易量。
    各地小型交流会除组织当地物资进行交流外，有的还根据当地产销情况，邀请与外地有来往的公私工商代表参加，以补助短距离物资交流之不足。河南省郑州市举行的药材百货骡马大会，邀请了湖南长沙市工商代表团等单位参加交流。长沙工商代表团除委托在会上代购大量火硝、蒲席、棕皮、石膏等土特产外，同时还大量供应了布匹、杂货、雨伞、纸张、松香、棕皮、石膏等土特产品及工业品。通过交流，郑州市公私营贸易企业与山东、陕西、湖南等九个省恢复并新建立了六十四处贸易关系。其他如福建沿海地区产的白糖，通过交流会大批供应该省南平、建瓯等内地人民需要。福州市出产的毛巾、土布、丝线等，亦大量销于永安、福安、仙游等农村。
    但是就全国来说，目前这种小型的物资交流会发展的还很不平衡。为了更加广泛地开展小城镇及一切基层市场的物资交流，开好小型物资交流会议，各地领导机关必须总结、并吸收已有的经验。各地组织短距离物资交流的主要经验有如下几点：
    一、党和政府必须重视和加强领导小型物资交流会会前的组织准备工作，组织国营企业、合作部门、私营工商业、银行、税务、运输、文教等各方面，共同筹商。工商行政部门，会前应调查当地各种商品的产销情况，制定出购销计划，根据计划，组织和动员各种经济力量大力采购各种物资，并充分供应群众所需要的工业品。凡领导机关重视，会前准备工作做的好，物资交流会就开得好。如平原省安阳专区在今年麦收前组织了二十四个庙会，会前调查了群众迫切需要牲口、农具和部分轻工业品，他们就大力组织这些商品。群众反映很好。对当地群众的土特产也是应事先有充分的调查，以便组织在会上推销。
    二、国营经济应很好地团结私商，积极参加短距离物资交流。小城镇私商的经济特点是经营分散、资金短小，但与基层市场的关系密切，因此，应当发挥小城镇私商对小型土产交流会的作用。各地也应适当掌握地区差价、批发和零售差价，照顾私商的合理利润。国家银行应在贷款上大力予以支持，在放款手续等方面，予以便利，来鼓励私商积极经营。
    三、要重视小型物资交流会进行中的业务组织与领导工作。交流会参加的人数多，成份杂，商品多，数量庞大，因此应当有领导、有计划、有组织的交流。在组织领导上要抓住这样几个环节：（一）公私进行协商，实行明码标价，并用广播筒及时播送价格，解决不识字农民的困难。（二）会议一切布置，应便利购销双方。各种商品分类陈列、好坏分明；在交流会场上设置交易所（公私营企业批发交易地方）和零售市场三个部分，便利客商购销商品。（三）加强市场管理，取缔商业陋规，适当减低佣金，树立新的商业风气。（四）交易方式要灵活，在交流时，可采取现款现货，期款期货，以货易货、赊购赊销、代购代销等各种形式进行交易；
    （五）加强治安工作，建立良好会场秩序。
    四、小型物资交流会和文化娱乐活动相结合。这样一方面可以招徕顾客，另一方面也加强了物资交流会的教育意义。通过文化娱乐活动，改造旧庙会、旧集场一些落后方面。如过去旧庙会、旧集场往往有流氓、赌棍、“神医”、“巫婆”乘机诈骗，这种现象必须改变。应利用文化教育和娱乐活动的各种工具，如放映电影、幻灯、组织富有教育意义的戏剧、说唱以及各种展览会等，进行活动，以便把群众吸引到正当的要求和兴趣上来，提高群众的觉悟水平。
