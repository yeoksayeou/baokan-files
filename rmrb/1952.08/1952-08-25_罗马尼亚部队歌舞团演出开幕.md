Xinhua News Agency, August 24th. The music and dance performance by the Romanian People's Republic Armed Forces Song and Dance Ensemble, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, officially opened on August 24th at the Experimental Theater of the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing. This is another artistic performance in our country by a fraternal country's cultural troupe, following the performances by the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian cultural troupes earlier this year. This performance will further strengthen the friendly cooperation and cultural exchange between our country and fraternal countries, as well as the cause of defending world peace.

More than 1,200 people attended the opening ceremony on the 24th, including figures from the capital's literary and art circles, literary and art workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and heads of central and Beijing agencies and organizations. The Romanian Ambassador to China, Mr. Rudenko, and embassy staff also attended the opening ceremony. Foreign diplomatic officials stationed in China were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

The opening ceremony began with the national anthems of China and Romania. Tian Han, Director of the Art Affairs Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Ministry of Culture and the literary and art circles of our country. The head of the song and dance ensemble, Moinescu Corneanu, delivered a reply. Every musical and dance program performed by the song and dance ensemble was warmly welcomed by the audience. The performance did not end until late at night. During and after the performance, representatives of various Chinese artistic groups presented flags, flowers, and gifts to the song and dance ensemble.

The Romanian People's Republic Armed Forces Song and Dance Ensemble was established five years ago, and all members are selected from outstanding soldiers and worker art enthusiasts. The ensemble has close ties with soldiers and the broad masses of working people, and has made many tours of performances for soldiers and working people across the country. Over the past five years, the ensemble has created and performed more than 200 mass and soldier songs and more than 50 new dances. In May of this year, many members of the ensemble received medals awarded by the Ministry of Armed Forces of the Romanian People's Republic.

The ensemble's programs mainly express the Romanian people's heroic struggle to defend world peace and their joyful labor and happy life in building socialism. The forms of these programs fully promote the excellent tradition of Romanian national art and also well absorb the advanced artistic experiences of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries.

The ensemble will perform more than 30 programs in our country, divided into chorus, dance, and orchestra sections. The chorus includes songs such as "The Party's Banner (in praise of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej)," "Forward," "Anthem of the Romanian People's Army," "Song of the Peace Fighters," and "Ode to Stalin"; there are also Chinese songs "The East is Red," "March of the Chinese People's Volunteers," and "The Internationale." The dances include "New Soldier Dance," "People's Bread," and "Romanian Folk Dance."

After the opening ceremony on the 24th, the ensemble will perform three shows each at the Capital's Working People's Cultural Palace Labor Theater and the Xian Nong Tan Sports Stadium Square to entertain workers, soldiers, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

After the performances in Beijing, the ensemble will also travel to major cities in Central South, East China, Northwest, and Northeast China to perform.
