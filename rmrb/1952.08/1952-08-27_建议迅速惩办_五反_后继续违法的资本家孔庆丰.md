    Suggest Swift Punishment for Capitalist Kong Qingfeng for Continued Illegal Activities After the "Five-Antis" Campaign
    Editor: The shop assistant Han Guole of Ruihua Photo Studio in West Street, Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, committed suicide after being framed by the capitalist. The manager of the studio, Kong Qingfeng, is an illegal capitalist. He did not recognize his mistakes during the "Five-Antis" movement. Instead, he slandered the "Five-Antis" movement, saying, "The working class is unreasonable, making trouble out of nothing, wanting some money." Whenever the shop assistants' active actions were mentioned, he gritted his teeth and tried to retaliate at all times. He often threatened Han Guole, saying, "I must fire you." In order to achieve the goal of dismissing Han Guole, he went to the Changzhi City Trade Union to falsely accuse Han Guole of being a "hooligan" who "never went home in the middle of the night" (referring to being late coming home from meetings during the "Five-Antis" campaign), "not working at the counter but still wanting wages, stealing money from the counter, spending the photography income without going through the manager," etc. (In fact, Han had not received wages for more than a year and two months in the studio, and the manager only gave him 360,000 yuan after several struggles). In addition, Kong Qingfeng also publicized everywhere, "Han Guole must be fired." Lian Youliang, the director of the street trade union, due to his unstable stance, listened to Kong Qingfeng's false accusations and criticized and accused Han Guole without principle. As a result, Han Guole committed suicide by jumping into a well. On the same day, the Municipal People's Government confirmed that the illegal capitalist Kong Qingfeng was fabricating accusations to frame the shop assistant, and immediately detained Kong Qingfeng for interrogation.
    The main responsibility for Han Guole's suicide should be borne by the capitalist Kong Qingfeng. Of course, trade union cadre Lian Youliang should also bear some responsibility and should make a profound self-criticism. We suggest that the Changzhi Municipal People's Government promptly and seriously handle this matter and give the capitalists who are still rampant after the "Five-Antis" campaign the punishment they deserve. We also hope that shop assistant comrades and trade union cadres in various places will pay attention, be vigilant, and fight against all illegal capitalists to the end. Cao Hua Liu Xin

### 建议迅速惩办“五反”后继续违法的资本家孔庆丰

    建议迅速惩办“五反”后继续违法的资本家孔庆丰
    编辑同志：山西省长治市西街瑞华照相馆店员韩过乐被资本家陷害而自杀了。该馆经理孔庆丰是一个违法资本家。他在“五反”运动中也没有认识到自己的错误，反而诬蔑“五反”运动说：“工人阶级不说理，没事找事，想要两个钱。”一提到店员们的积极行动，他便咬牙切齿，时时企图报复。他经常威胁韩过乐说：“非把你开除不可。”为了达到开除韩过乐的目的，他曾到长治市工会诬告韩过乐是“流氓”，“曾经三更半夜不回家”（“五反”时因开会回来迟一些），“在柜上不劳动还要工资，偷柜上的钱、不经过经理把照相收入的钱化了”等等（实际上，韩到该馆一年零二个多月，没有领过工资，经过几次斗争，经理才先后给了三十六万元）。另外，孔庆丰还到处宣扬“非开除韩过乐不可”。街道工会主任连有良，由于立场不稳，听信了孔庆丰的诬告，无原则地对韩过乐进行批评、指责。结果韩过乐投井自杀了。当天，市人民政府证实违法资本家孔庆丰是捏辞陷害店员，即把孔庆丰扣押审讯。
    韩过乐自杀的主要责任应由资本家孔庆丰来负。当然，工会干部连有良也应负一定责任，应作深刻检讨。我们建议长治市人民政府迅速认真处理这件事，给“五反”后仍然猖狂的资本家以应有的惩处。并望各地的店员同志们、工会干部们引起注意，提高警惕，向一切违法资本家斗争到底。曹华  刘信
