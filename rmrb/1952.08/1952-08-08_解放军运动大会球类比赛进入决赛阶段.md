In addition, the General Political Department of the Military Commission "August 1st" basketball team and the Beijing Jinglian basketball team gave exhibition games.

    The North China Military Region and the Public Security Forces held the baseball championship final. The North China Military Region baseball team, composed entirely of company-level cadres and soldiers, played both skillfully and tenaciously. They defeated the Public Security Forces 19-0 to win the baseball championship.

    This morning there were several fierce basketball, soccer, and volleyball finals. The men's volleyball final between the Air Force and the Central South Military Region was very tense. The Air Force team's spikes were extremely fierce, and their rescues of dangerous balls were so skillful, and their cooperation was excellent. The Air Force defeated the Central South Military Region three to one. Currently, the teams that have qualified for the basketball finals are the Central South Military Region, the Northeast Military Region, the Southwest Military Region, and the Public Security Forces; the teams that have qualified for the women's volleyball finals are the Navy, the Central South Military Region, the North China Military Region, and the Southwest Military Region, and the teams that have qualified for the men's volleyball finals are the Southwest Military Region, the East China Military Region, the Central South Military Region, and the Air Force.

    A moving scene occurred in the tug-of-war final between the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Northwest Military Region. At the end of the first round, athlete No. 310 from the Northwest Military Region fainted and left the field, reducing the Northwest Military Region's side from twelve to eleven people, forming a one-sided situation. However, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army gave up this opportunity to win easily and voluntarily reduced one person as well.

    The 20,000-meter motorcycle final was very competitive. The athletes were brave and tenacious and persevered to the end. Yu Yuansheng (Northeast Military Region) in the second group still had 2,000 meters to go when the first and second place finishers had already reached the finish line, but he still worked hard to complete the entire distance. The audience applauded him warmly as if welcoming a winner.

    Today also held the 1,200-meter armed equestrian final. Cavalry soldier Gang Shimule (from Inner Mongolia) from the North China Military Region won first place.

    The cavalry athletes also gave several brave equestrian performances and polo performances. Children from Inner Mongolia also performed light cavalry performances.

The high jump result was 1.76 meters, breaking the national record (1.75 meters) since liberation. The men's 800-meter relay final result was one minute and thirty-five seconds seven, also breaking the national record (one minute and forty-two seconds) since liberation.
