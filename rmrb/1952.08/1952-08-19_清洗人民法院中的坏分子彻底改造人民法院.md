Brief Comments on Political and Legal Work

    The situation of corruption and degeneration in the Xuzhou People's Court, as reported in today's newspaper, demonstrates that judicial reform work is now of utmost urgency. Courts like the one in Xuzhou, and the one in Wen County, Pingyuan Province, reported in this newspaper some time ago, are not People's Courts at all. They cannot serve as weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship. They are dens of iniquity that oppress revolutionary people, rape women, embezzle and pervert the law, and shield counter-revolutionaries and illegal bourgeois elements. The people, liberated after a long revolutionary struggle, will never allow such courts and such judicial personnel to continue their evil deeds! Our party and government leading organs have a full responsibility to lead the broad masses of the people, using revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods, to thoroughly purge those bad elements who must be purged and to thoroughly transform our People's Courts.
    From a national perspective, such thoroughly corrupted People's Courts are naturally a small minority, but similar situations of varying degrees are numerous. That is: the proportion of old judicial personnel is very large, and many of them hold the most critical judicial positions. Most of these people have not undergone thorough transformation, and their reactionary and decadent ideological styles are still maintained; many of the court cadres assigned by the leading organs are also cadres of very poor quality who cannot truly stand on the people's side and work for the people; given the opportunity, they collude with the bad elements among the old judicial personnel, embezzle and pervert the law, and commit all kinds of evil; or, in terms of ideological viewpoints, they accept the influence of the old laws and old judicial personnel, and unconsciously become prisoners. As a result, incidents that intentionally or unintentionally harm the interests of the people are endless.
    In the large-scale judicial reform movement, we should mobilize and rely on the broad masses of the people to conduct thorough criticism and exposure of the above-mentioned phenomena. Among the new and old judicial personnel, we should also organize universal mutual criticism, exposure, and self-confession, thoroughly clarify the important issues in all aspects, and then, depending on the circumstances, carry out necessary and appropriate handling. People's Courts like the one in Xuzhou must undergo thorough organizational transformation.

### 清洗人民法院中的坏分子彻底改造人民法院

    清洗人民法院中的坏分子彻底改造人民法院
    今天本报发表的徐州市人民法院腐烂变质的情形，说明司法改革工作已经是刻不容缓的了。像徐州市这样的法院，以及前些时本报发表的平原省温县的法院，完全不是人民的法院，它决不能充当人民民主专政的武器，它是欺压革命人民、强奸妇女、贪赃枉法、包庇反革命、包庇不法资产阶级分子的罪恶渊薮。经过长期革命斗争而解放了的人民，决不能容许这样的法院和这样的司法人员继续为非作歹了！我们的党政领导机关，完全有责任来领导广大人民，用革命的精神和革命的办法，彻底清洗那些必须清洗的坏分子，彻底改造我们的人民法院。
    从全国范围来看，这样彻底腐烂了的人民法院自然是极少数，但不同程度的类似的情况却是很多的。这就是：旧司法人员占的比重很大，而且有不少担任着最关紧要的审判工作，其中多数人没有经过彻底的改造，反动腐朽的思想作风仍旧保持着；由领导机关配备的一些法院干部，也有许多是不能真正站在人民立场为人民办事的质量很差的干部；他们一有机会，便和旧司法人员中的坏分子结合起来，贪赃枉法，为非作恶；或者是在思想观点上接受旧法律和旧司法人员的影响，不自觉地做了俘虏。于是，有意无意地危害人民群众利益的事，就层出不穷。
    在大规模的司法改革运动中，我们应该发动与依靠广大群众，对上述现象进行彻底的批评与揭发；在新旧司法人员中，也应该组织普遍的互相批评、揭发和自己坦白，把各方面的重要问题彻底弄清，然后分别情况，进行必要的与适当的处理。像徐州市这样的人民法院，则必须进行彻底的组织上的改造。
