Gao Yubao Writes a Book
(Based on Gao Yubao's article "How I Learned Culture and Writing?")
Chen Xinghua Painting

    Twenty-five. The troops set off to liberate Guangxi, and I became a military mailman. While waiting for the troops on the road, I wrote my book in my spare time.

    Twenty-six. I also wrote my book when feeding the horses in the morning and evening.

    Twenty-seven. During the pursuit of Bai Chongxi's bandit troops in Guangxi, my horse died while crossing the mountains. I carried my book bag and completed the mission, still writing my book.

    二十五、部队出发解放广西，我当军邮员。在路上等部队时，我空下来就写书。
    二十六、早晚喂马的时候，我也写书。
    二十七、在广西追击白崇禧部匪军时，过大山马卡死了，我背着书包同样完成了任务，同样写书。
