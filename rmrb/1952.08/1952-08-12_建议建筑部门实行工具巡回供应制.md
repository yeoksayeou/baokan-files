Title: Suggest Implementing a Tool Rotation Supply System in the Construction Sector

    To the Editor: Currently, there are irrational aspects in the use of tools within some construction departments. The common practice is for each construction site to collect tools from the relevant department at the start of a project, and then collect additional tools as needed during construction, returning them upon completion. This approach, while seemingly convenient, leads to a lack of planning in tool procurement by site administrators, resulting in either tool stockpiles or shortages. Last winter, during our company's fund verification, we found tools worth 2,500 catties of rice stockpiled at the bank construction site, never used. Therefore, I suggest that construction departments implement a rotational supply system for construction tools. For example, if there are ten construction sites, each with three hundred workers, requiring two hundred shovels per site, the old method would require preparing two thousand shovels for these ten sites to collect. With rotational supply, the tools can be rotated and allocated based on the order of commencement, so only one thousand shovels, or even fewer, need to be prepared. Just as with shovels, so too with other tools. In this way, each construction site, apart from the daily necessities, will not stockpile tools in bulk, nor will each site have small warehouses of stockpiled tools.

    Editor's Note: All construction departments should develop towards specialized teams and implement dedicated tool usage. However, under the current circumstances, tool supply work is indeed relatively chaotic, and a tool rotation supply system can be appropriately adopted based on the situation.

### 建议建筑部门实行工具巡回供应制

    建议建筑部门实行工具巡回供应制
    编辑同志：目前若干建筑部门在使用工具方面还有不合理之处。一般的办法是开工时各个工地向主管部门领取，工程进行中临时需要什么再领什么，完工后交回。这种办法，表面上看来很方便，实际上使工地事务人员购置工具没有计划，结果，工具不是积压就是不足。我公司去年冬季核定资金时，在银行工地清理出价值二千五百斤米的工具根本没有使用。因此，我建议各建筑部门，施行建筑工具巡回使用的供应方法。比如有十个工地施工，每工地有三百个工人，需要二百把铁锹，按旧有办法就得预备二千把铁锹，听候这十个施工单位来领。实行巡回供应就不同了，可根据开工先后的顺序，巡回调配，这样则只预备一千把铁锹，甚至还可少些，就能调配过来。铁锹如是，其他工具也如是。这样每个工地除日常必须的工具外，不会成批的积压工具，也不会每个工地都有积压工具的小仓库。

    编者按：各建筑部门都要向专业队发展，实行工具专用。但在目前情况下，工具供应工作确实比较混乱，可根据情况，适当采用工具巡回供应制度。
