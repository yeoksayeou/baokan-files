    Yao Youth Lan Song's Joy
    Comrade Editor: After reading the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China," I couldn't help but burst into tears. I am a student at Peking University, a Yao youth. Before liberation, I didn't know which ethnic group I belonged to, and my relatives were unwilling to tell me which ethnic group I was. Sometimes, I would say I was Han, because that way I wouldn't be insulted. The Yao people are a hardworking people, with men, women, old and young all participating in labor. However, due to the reactionary rule and exploitation, my people suffered from hunger and cold every year, even to the point of family destruction. After Chairman Mao came, I knew I was Yao, and I enjoyed the same freedom and equality as my fraternal ethnic compatriots. Moreover, I was admitted to university. For the past three years, all the Yao people, like me, have been singing day and night for the light and happiness that Chairman Mao brought us. In the future, I will use diligent study and practical actions to prepare to dedicate myself to the motherland, to celebrate the promulgation of the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China," and to repay Chairman Mao!

    畬族青年蓝松的喜悦
    编辑同志：读了“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”，我禁不住热泪盈眶。我是北京大学的学生，一个畬族青年。解放前，我不知道我是那一个民族，我的亲人们也不愿告诉我是那一个民族。有时，我就说我是汉族，因为这样可以不被侮辱。畬族人民是勤劳的人民，男女老幼都参加劳动。但是，由于反动派的统治和压榨，我族人民没有一年不受饥受冻，甚至要家破人亡。毛主席来了以后，我知道了我是畬族，我享受着和兄弟民族同胞一样的自由和平等。并且，我还进了大学。三年来，所有的畬族人民和我一样，为毛主席给我们带来的光明和幸福，而日以继夜地欢唱着。今后我要用努力学习，准备献身祖国的实际行动，来庆祝“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”的公布，来报答毛主席！　　　　　　　蓝　松
