    Leading Organs in Various Regions Should Pay Attention to Correcting the Bad Habit of Making False Reports
    In our various levels of organs, industrial and mining enterprises, and mass organizations, some staff members lack a realistic and serious responsible work style, or they have a bad “show-off” mentality. When making work reports to higher leading organs, many are untrue, and some are even completely fabricated. This situation should arouse serious attention from leading organs in various regions, and effective measures should be taken to correct it. Last year, Hegang City, Songjiang Province, reported that Yang Haishan's group averaged 8,000 catties of corn per hectare, and Yang Haishan personally planted 7,000 catties of soybeans per hectare. However, the actual investigation by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Songjiang Province proved that the average corn yield per hectare of the group's seven households was only 3,140 catties, and Yang Haishan's personal soybean yield per hectare was only 3,450 catties. This year, the Renqiu County Production Office of Hebei Province reported to the Cangxian Special District Production Office that six villages in the third district of the county had organized credit cooperatives in drought prevention and resistance work, absorbing more than 11 million yuan of idle funds from the masses, more than 29,000 bricks, and 1,000 catties of grain, solving the difficulties of local farmers in digging wells. However, inspection proved that this report was false. These villages did not organize any credit cooperatives, but used coercive methods to launch so-called "free lending" among the masses. For example, the village cadres of Shimenqiao Village called 34 relatively wealthy farmers in the name of organizing credit shares, stipulated an interest rate of 1.5%, and let these farmers report the amount of lending themselves. The money, grain, and bricks collected by the village in this way were actually only enough to dig six wells, but the Renqiu County Production Office reported that it could dig 35 wells. In mid-April, the Jian'guo County Production and Drought Prevention Office of Hebei Province reported to the Cangxian Special District Production and Drought Prevention Office that the county had dug 854 wells. When the Special District Production and Drought Prevention Office inquired further, they said that only 378 wells had been completed, and the others were just under construction or had just dug the wellbore. By the end of April, the county had dug only 136 wells, proving that the previous reports were all false. The Wang Guihua mutual aid group in Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, is a poorly performing mutual aid group. However, the leading cadres of the city, due to their credulity in the false reports below, rated it as a model last year and awarded it a banner; this year, they decided to cultivate it as a banner for the mutual aid groups in the suburbs, and lent it more than 9 million yuan worth of fertilizers, agricultural tools, etc. Wang Renjue, deputy director of the Municipal People's Government Office, and Hu Ximan, head of the Construction Section, etc., went to inspect it several times, but did not find any problems with this mutual aid group. It was not until June of this year that it was found that this mutual aid group not only did not meet the conditions of a model mutual aid group, but also had very poor crops and a lot of weeds. In January this year, Tongbai County, Henan Province, held a labor model conference. Wang Enkuan, chairman of the Zhangzhuang Township Farmers' Association, designated Feng Yunzhang to participate, but the county's leading cadres did not review it. Wang Enkuan made a set of false reports on mutual aid production at the meeting. As a result, he was rated as a special-class agricultural labor model in the county, and later as a second-class labor model in Henan Province. Wang Xian, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in Xihewa Village, Guangling County, Chahar Province, intentionally fabricated a set of false plans for high-yield competition in the village. The county's leading cadres looked at this false plan and determined the village as a "high-yield village" without investigation. In June this year, the county held a representative meeting of labor models and mutual aid group leaders, and he falsely reported his achievements. As a result, the village was rated as a "model village" in the county. Recently, when the Yanbei Special District working group went to investigate, they discovered this situation, but it had already caused a bad influence among the masses. The local masses were very dissatisfied and had a wrong understanding of the production increase competition movement, and were unwilling to participate. Xie Jiuxiang, a cadre of the Democratic Women's Federation of Shanzhou Special District, Henan Province, went to the Nangxian Township farm busy nursery in Shan County in 1951. She forcibly put some children in the temple for a short period of time. Because she didn't take good care of them, some children got sick; after she left, the children never went there again. However, when she reported to the higher authorities, she said: "Because everyone worked hard and carefully, during the period when the nursery existed, the children did not have any falls and spent the busy farming season safely." She also said: "Since the Nangxian Township's farm busy nursery was piloted as a key project, other villages have been established one after another, with a total of six nurseries, accommodating 69 children. With the children taken care of, the women have a higher enthusiasm for production." These situations were all fabricated by her.
    This bad habit of making false reports has been discovered and corrected by higher authorities in a timely manner in some cases; but in some cases, it has not been discovered by higher authorities for a long time, and has even been used as a basis for formulating work plans, thus causing significant losses to the work. Last year, a locomotive of a certain locomotive section of the Wuchang Locomotive Depot of the Hengyang Railway Administration should have been stopped and sent to the depot for inspection, but the administration deliberately did not send it in order to establish a so-called "model"; even when an accident occurred, the leadership approved that it was not considered an accident, and still issued bonuses to the responsible personnel of the locomotive and praised their "achievements" everywhere. This made the trend of asking for credit and rewards prevail in various units of the administration. As a result, when the "Railway Workers" newspaper of Hengyang launched an accident inspection campaign in May last year, only a few units in the administration exposed more than 1,000 concealed accidents. According to a letter from our reader Liu Yaming, Suiyuan Province suffered from droughts, insects, hail, wind and other disasters last year, and crop yields generally decreased. In order to obtain more relief grain and reduce the agricultural tax burden of the masses, the leading organs in many places of the province intentionally exaggerated the disaster situation in their reports to the higher authorities. The Suiyuan Provincial People's Government concluded based on this inaccurate report that the average harvest in the province was only 45%, and that the province was severely short of grain. Therefore, the province took a series of measures to purchase grain from all over the place; but in fact, the average harvest in the province last year was 60% to 70%, and many farmers had surplus grain. This caused significant losses to the country and the people. The Suiyuan Provincial Branch of the Grain Company alone lost more than 10 billion yuan in transportation, loading, unloading, and storage costs for transporting more than 60 million catties of grain back and forth.

    各地领导机关应注意纠正作假报告的恶劣作风
    在我们的各级机关、工矿企业和群众团体中，有一些工作人员由于缺乏实事求是和严肃负责的作风，或者是由于有恶劣的“出风头”思想，在向上级领导机关作工作报告时，有许多是不真实的，甚至是完全凭空捏造的假情况。这种情形，应引起各地领导机关的严重注意，并采取有效办法予以纠正。去年松江省鹤岗市报告杨海山小组平均每垧产苞米八千斤，杨海山个人所种大豆每垧产七千斤。但松江省农林厅实际调查的结果，证明该组七户的苞米每垧平均仅产三千一百四十斤，杨海山个人的大豆每垧也只产三千四百五十斤。今年河北省任邱县生产办公室曾向沧县专区生产办公室报告说，该县三区六个村在防旱抗旱工作中组织了信贷社，吸收了群众的游资一千一百多万元，砖两万九千多块和粮食一千斤，解决了当地农民打井的困难。但经检查，证明这个报告是假的。这几个村并未组织起什么信贷社，而是在群众中用强迫命令的方式发动了所谓“自由借贷”。如石门桥村的村干部就以组织信贷股为名，把三十四户较富裕的农民叫来，规定了一分五的利息，让这些农户自报放账的数目。该村用这种办法收集起来的钱、粮和砖，实际只够打六眼井，而任邱县生产办公室却报告说能够打三十五眼井。四月中旬河北省建国县生产防旱办公室向沧县专区生产防旱办公室报告，全县已打井八百五十四眼。专区生产防旱办公室一追问，他们又说已经打成的只有三百七十八眼了，其他只是正动工或只是打出了井筒。到四月下旬全县打井也不过一百三十六眼，证明以前的报告都是假的。湖南省湘潭市王桂华互助组是一个生产不好的互助组。但该市的领导干部由于轻信了下面的假报告，去年把它评为模范，发给了锦旗；今年又决定把它培养成为郊区互助组的旗帜，贷给了价值九百多万元的肥料、农具等。该市人民政府办公室副主任王人爵和建设科长胡锡满等虽曾一再去检查，也没有发现这一互助组的问题。直到今年六月才查出这个互助组不但没有具备模范互助组的条件，而且庄稼长得很不好，野草很多。河南省桐柏县今年一月举行劳动模范大会，该县张庄乡农会主任王恩宽指定冯云章参加，该县领导干部没有加以审查。王恩宽在会上作了一套关于互助生产的假报告。结果他被评为县农业特等劳动模范，以后又被评为河南省二等劳动模范。察哈尔省广灵县西河窊村中共支部书记王献有意地虚构了一套该村丰产竞赛的假计划，该县领导干部看了这套假计划，未经调查，就确定该村为“丰产村”。今年六月该县召开劳动模范和互助组长代表会议，他又虚报成绩，结果该村又被评为全县的“模范村”。最近雁北专区工作组前去调查时才发现了这一情况，但已在群众中造成恶劣影响。当地群众很不满意，对增产竞赛运动产生了错误的认识，不愿参加。河南省陕州专区民主妇女联合会干部谢玖香，曾于一九五一年到陕县南县乡办农忙托儿所。她用强迫的方式把一些孩子放在庙里呆了很短的一段时间，因为照顾不好，有些孩子还得了病；自她走后，孩子们再也没有去。但她在向上级报告时却说：“因为大家努力、小心，托儿所存在期间，孩子们没有发生跌伤的现象，都平平安安地度过了农忙时节。”又说：“南县乡的农忙托儿所自从重点试办后，其他村都先后成立起来，共办了六个所，收容了六十九个孩子。孩子有人照管，妇女们生产情绪更高了。”这些情况都是她自己捏造的。
    这种作假报告的恶劣作风，有的已为上级机关及时发现和纠正；但有的很长时间都未被上级机关发现，甚至还据以制订了工作计划，因而使工作受到重大损失。去年衡阳铁路管理局武昌机务段某机车本来应该停开送段甲检，但该局为了树立所谓“模范”，故意不送；甚至出了事故，领导方面还批准不算事故，仍然给这辆机车的负责人员发奖金，到处表扬他们的“成绩”。这样就使得该局各单位邀功请赏之风盛行起来。结果，去年五月衡阳“铁路工人”报发起检查事故运动时，全局仅部分单位就暴露出隐瞒的事故一千多件。据本报读者柳崖明来信说，去年绥远省遭受了旱、虫、雹、风等灾害，农作物普遍减产。该省很多地方的领导机关为了多领救济粮，减少群众的农业税负担，便在给上级的报告中有意夸大灾情。绥远省人民政府根据这种不确实的报告作出结论，认为全省平均收成仅四成半，全省缺粮很多。因而该省采取了一系列的措施，四出购粮；但实际上该省去年的平均收成是六至七成，许多农民都有余粮。这样就给国家和人民造成了重大损失。仅粮食公司绥远省分公司往返调运六千多万斤粮食，在运输、装卸、保管等费用上就损失了一百亿元以上。
