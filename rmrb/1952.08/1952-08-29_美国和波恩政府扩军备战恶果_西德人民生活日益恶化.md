    [News from Our Newspaper] Comprehensive news: As a result of the frenzied arms expansion and war preparations by the US, British, and French occupying authorities and the West German Adenauer government, the material living conditions of the West German people continue to deteriorate. The prices of daily necessities, as well as transportation costs, electricity, water, gas, and coal, are constantly rising. According to the German News Agency, oil prices in Düsseldorf rose by 24 percent and rice prices by 33 percent in one month. Compared with 1949, flour prices rose by 54.7 percent, sugar prices by 14.7 percent, and beef prices by 33.9 percent.
    Looking at the lives of West German students, most of them are both underfed and sleep-deprived. Students eat only one meal a day, sometimes two. As for daily breakfast, the West German newspaper "Die Welt" once truthfully pointed out: "Breakfast is a novel fantasy for many students." Their food is mostly bread, plus some margarine. "Die Welt" recently talked about student housing, saying: In the ancient university town of Bonn, about three hundred students live in the original air-raid shelters. The newspaper described the situation of this "dormitory" as follows: "The six-square-meter room has no windows, only a crack the size of a palm for air circulation. The room has a bed and an empty vegetable box as a substitute for a chair. Two students, sometimes a family with children, live in such a small room." "Die Welt" said: In addition to the air-raid shelters, the students rented a former prison as a "dormitory." Students have to pay ten to fifteen marks per month to rent a prison cell, which accounts for almost a quarter of their budget.
    From these fragments, it can be seen how great a disaster the American policy of reviving West German militarism has brought to the West German people. The reason is clear: the cost of war preparations consumes most of West Germany's budget.

### 美国和波恩政府扩军备战恶果  西德人民生活日益恶化

    美国和波恩政府扩军备战恶果
    西德人民生活日益恶化
    【本报讯】综合消息：美英法三国占领当局及西德阿登纳政府疯狂进行扩军备战的结果，使得西德人民的物质生活状况不断恶化。生活必需品的价格及运输费、电费、水费、煤气费等都不断上涨。根据德意志通讯社的消息，杜塞尔多夫一个月中油类涨价百分之二十四，大米涨价百分之三十三。与一九四九年比较，面粉涨价百分之五十四点七，糖涨价百分之十四点七，牛肉涨价百分之三十三点九。
    以西德学生的生活来看，他们大多数是既吃不饱又睡不好，学生们一天只吃一顿，有时候吃两顿。至于每天的早餐，西德报纸“世界报”曾经符合事实地指出：“早餐是许多学生的新奇的幻想。”他们的食物多半是面包，再加上一些人造奶油。“世界报”最近谈到学生的住所说：在古代的大学城波恩，约有三百个学生住在原来的防空洞里。这个报纸描写这种“宿舍”的情形说：“六平方公尺的房子没有一个窗户，只有不过手掌般大小的一个裂口来流通空气。屋里有一张床和代替椅子的一个空的菜盒子。两个学生，有时候还是有小孩的一个家庭，就住在这样的一间小屋子里。“世界报”说：除了防空洞以外，学生们租了原来是监狱的一所房子作“宿舍”。学生们每月不得不付出十到十五马克来借一个牢房，这笔数目差不多占他们预算的四分之一。
    从这种片断的情况中就可以看出：美国复活西德军国主义的政策带给了西德人民多么大的灾难。道理很明白，备战费用耗去了西德的大部分预算。
