    Cleared Six Months of Old Accounts in One Month
    Comrade Editor: All comrades of the Accounting Section of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, in the production increase and economy campaign, strengthened their connection with various workshops and implemented a scientific division of labor. In July, they cleared all the accounts that had been backlogged for six months due to the "Three-Anti" movement. Our methods are: First, we signed liaison contracts with the coking, ironmaking, rolling, power, transportation, purchasing, warehouse, repair, and refractory workshops, stipulating that the auxiliary workshops guarantee to calculate and allocate expenses on time, calculate costs, and calculate distribution bases; the management departments guarantee to submit management expense allocation items on time. This overcame the past phenomenon of delays, which led to the backlog of new accounts once the old accounts were completed, saving time that was used to sort out the old accounts.

    Second, we divided the work clearly and rationally allocated manpower according to the characteristics of each person in the accounting section. For example, those who were good at copying were dedicated to copying; those who were good at using the abacus did the totaling work; those who were good at using the calculating machine did the multiplication and division work; those who were good at bookkeeping did the bookkeeping work; those who were good at checking did the checking work. As a result, work efficiency increased threefold compared to 1950 and more than doubled compared to 1951. For example, in the material account group, in the initial stage of account establishment, one person would read and several people would check, and they could only check 500 pages per day. Now it has been changed to several people dividing up the reading work, with someone familiar with the work paired with someone unfamiliar. On average, one person can check 1,500 pages per day, increasing work efficiency by two times.

    一个月清理了六个月的旧账
    编辑同志：太原钢铁厂会计科全体同志，在增产节约运动中，加强和各车间联系，实行科学的分工，在七月份内，清理了因“三反”运动而积压的六个月的全部账目。我们的办法是：首先和炼焦、炼铁、轧调、动力、运输、采购、仓库、修造、耐火等车间订立联系合同，规定辅助车间保证按时算出分配费用，算出成本和分配基数；管理部门保证按时提出管理费用分配项目。克服了过去拖延时间，以致旧账算好新账积压的现象，节约了时间，用以整理旧账。
    其次，我们根据会计科各人的特点，明确地分工，合理地配备人力。例如擅长于抄写的就专做抄写工作；擅长于打算盘的就做合计工作；擅长于摇计算机的就做乘除工作；擅长于记账的做记账工作；擅长于核对的做核对工作。因此工作效率比一九五零年提高了三倍；比一九五一年提高了一倍多。比如材料账组在建账工作中，原先是一个人念几个人核对，每天只能核对五百页，现在改为几个人分工念，工作熟悉的配一个不熟悉的，一天平均一个人能核对一千五百页，提高工作效率两倍。
