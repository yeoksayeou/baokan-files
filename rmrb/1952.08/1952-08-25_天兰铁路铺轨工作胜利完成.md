    Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway Track-Laying Successfully Completed
    [This dispatch from Lanzhou, August 24th] The track-laying for the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway was successfully completed at 21:30 on August 23rd at the East Lanzhou Station. As the first train arrived in the outskirts of Lanzhou, its whistle sounded for several minutes, exciting the people of the entire city with this sound symbolizing prosperity and happiness. The construction site was adorned with colorful flags, and crowds thronged there all day. People living on the north bank of the Yellow River even crossed the river on sheepskin rafts to see the train. The Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway stretches across the Qinling and Liupan Mountains, alongside the Wei and Yellow Rivers, overcoming mountains and waters, making the project arduous. All the employees of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau worked day and night, completing the 360-kilometer track-laying work in one year and twenty-three days. This enables the plan for opening the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway eight months ahead of schedule to be completed as scheduled. This is another great happy event in the economic life of the people of the whole country. Currently, the employees of each engineering section along the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway are stepping up the construction of stations and reinforcing the roadbed in order to welcome the opening ceremony on National Day.

    天兰铁路铺轨工作胜利完成
    【本报兰州二十四日专电】天（水）兰（州）铁路于八月二十三日二十一时三十分铺轨至兰州东站。当第一列火车驶抵兰州近郊时，汽笛飞鸣达数分钟之久，全市人民为这象征着繁荣和幸福的声音所激动。工地上彩旗缤纷，终日人群川流不息，住在黄河北岸的人，也纷纷坐着羊皮筏子过河来看火车。天兰铁路伸展在秦岭和六盘山脉上，傍依渭河黄河，翻山越水，工程艰巨。西北铁路干线工程局全体员工日以继夜，历时一年零二十三天，完成了三百六十公里的铺轨工作，使天兰铁路提前八个月通车的计划，可以如期完成。这是全国人民经济生活中的又一件大喜事。现在天兰路沿线各工程段员工，正加紧修建车站，加固路基，以迎接国庆节通车典礼。
