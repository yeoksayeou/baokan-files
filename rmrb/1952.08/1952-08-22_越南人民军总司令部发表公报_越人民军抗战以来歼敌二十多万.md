Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 21st: Since December 1946, when the French colonialists perfidiously tore up the agreements they had signed with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and launched a full-scale invasion of Vietnam, the Vietnam People's Army and the people's armed forces have fought heroically and achieved the great victory of annihilating nearly 220,000 French troops.

According to a Vietnam News Agency report from North Vietnam on the 20th, a communiqué recently issued by the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army announced that from the beginning of the Vietnamese War of Resistance in December 1946 to June 1952, the Vietnam People's Army and the people's armed forces annihilated 219,346 French officers and soldiers. Among them, from December 1946 to the end of 1951, the Vietnam People's Army and the people's armed forces annihilated a total of 170,000 French troops; from the liberation of Hoa Binh in February 1952 to the beginning of June 1952, the Vietnam People's Army and the people's armed forces annihilated 49,346 French troops.

Among the enemy forces killed were two Major Generals and eight Colonels of the French high command. In May 1951, the Vietnam People's Army killed General Altmayer, Commander of the French Far East Air Force, in Cao Bang; in July of the same year, French Commissioner to South Vietnam and Commander of the French Forces in South Vietnam, Chanson, was killed in South Vietnam.

From the beginning of Vietnam's full-scale war of resistance to June of this year, the Vietnam People's Army captured 118 artillery pieces, 195 rocket launchers, 384 mortars, 10,395 machine guns, 43,068 rifles, 71 vehicles, and 228 radio stations.

During the same period, the Vietnam People's Army also destroyed 165 French aircraft, 4,143 vehicles, 201 train locomotives, 564 train carriages, 139 river boats, 87 steamships, and 60 artillery pieces.
