    Pyongyang Celebrates the Seventh Anniversary of Korea's Liberation
    Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao
    Respected Chairman Mao Zedong:
    On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the liberation of our country from Japanese imperialist colonial rule thanks to the great Soviet armed forces on "August 15th," we extend our national gratitude and warm congratulations to you, who are sincerely assisting the just Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people.

    During the war, our Korean People's Army, together with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, defeated the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples, the American armed aggressors and their lackeys, gloriously defended the independence and freedom of our country, and contributed to the great cause of safeguarding peace and security in Asia and the world.

    In the most difficult period for the Korean people, the fraternal Chinese people under your leadership sent the People's Volunteer Army composed of their outstanding sons and daughters to the Korean battlefield to assist us, and continue to support us under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea. We will never forget this kindness. We will forever remember in our hearts the noble blood shed and the immortal feats established by the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers on our country's soil.

    Today, the unbreakable fraternal friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples, forged in blood in the struggle against the common enemy, the American armed aggressors, is not only the guarantee of our victory, but has also become a new example of the internationalist friendship and solidarity of peace-loving people around the world.

    Dear Chairman Mao Zedong: Disregarding its successive failures in the face of the heroic struggle of our Korean and Chinese peoples, the American armed aggressors have not yet abandoned their aggressive ambitions towards Korea and Chinese territory, deliberately delaying and sabotaging the armistice negotiations, and continuing to perpetrate various savage atrocities in order to expand the war.

    However, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, tempered and strengthened in the cruel struggle against the enemy, will surely defeat and crush any mad offensive attempts by the enemy. With the warm support and solidarity of peace-loving people all over the world, led by the great Stalin, the Korean people will surely achieve victory.

    In the great family of the world democratic camp led by the great Stalin, the fraternal friendship and solidarity of the Korean and Chinese peoples, who are fighting for peace and freedom, will be further consolidated, and its power will be invincible.

    For the greater happiness and prosperity of the Chinese people in the future, and for the lasting peace and security of Asia, we wish you a long life.

    平壤市各界庆祝朝鲜解放七周年纪念大会
    给毛主席的致敬电
    敬爱的毛泽东主席：
    我们在纪念我们祖国由于伟大的苏联武力而从日本帝国主义殖民地统治下获得解放的“八·一五”七周年之际，谨向诚挚地援助着朝鲜人民正义的祖国解放战争的您致以全民族的感谢和热烈的祝贺。
    在战争过程中，我们朝鲜人民军和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军一道击溃了朝中两国人民的共同敌人美国武装侵略者及其走狗，而光荣地保卫了我们祖国的独立、自由，并在保卫亚洲及世界和平与安全的伟大事业上作了贡献。
    在朝鲜人民最艰苦的时期，您所领导的兄弟般的中国人民，把自己的优秀儿女所组成的人民志愿军部队派到朝鲜战场来援助我们，并在抗美援朝的旗帜下继续不断地给我们以支援。这种恩惠我们永远不会忘记。兄弟般的中国人民志愿军将士们在我们祖国土地上所流下的高贵鲜血和建立的不朽功勋，我们将永远铭记在心海里。
    今天在反对共同敌人美国武装侵略者的斗争中以鲜血结成的朝中两国人民牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊团结，不但是我们胜利的保障，而且已经成为全世界爱好和平的人民国际主义友谊团结的新榜样。
    亲爱的毛泽东主席：美国武装侵略者不顾它在我们朝中两国人民的英雄斗争面前所连续遭到的失败，至今尚未放弃它对朝鲜和中国领土的侵略野心，蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判，并且为了扩大战争正在继续制造着种种野兽暴行。
    但是，在残酷的对敌斗争中锻炼和加强了的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，必将击溃和粉碎敌人的任何疯狂进攻企图。朝鲜人民在以伟大的苏联为首的全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持和声援下必将取得胜利。
    在伟大的斯大林所领导的世界民主阵营的大家庭里，为和平与自由而斗争的朝中两国人民兄弟般的友谊团结将进一步巩固，其力量是必胜不败的。
    为了中国人民今后更大的幸福和繁荣，为了亚洲的持久和平与安全，谨祝您万寿无疆。
