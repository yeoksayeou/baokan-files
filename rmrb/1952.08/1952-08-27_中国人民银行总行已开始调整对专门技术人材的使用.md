    The Head Office of the People's Bank of China Has Begun to Adjust the Use of Specialized Technical Personnel

    Editor: After the "Three-Anti" movement, we examined and found that in the past, due to our bank's insufficient understanding of the situation of its employees and inappropriate allocation, the use of many specialized technical personnel was not reasonable enough. After the "Three-Anti" movement, we have begun adjustment work in accordance with the instructions of our superiors. At present, we are continuing to make adjustments. The article "Rationally Use Agricultural Technicians" published in your newspaper's "Letters from Readers" column on July 17, which criticized the unreasonable phenomenon of our bank's Rural Finance Administration's use of agricultural technicians, has further prompted us to pay attention to this work and immediately conduct an in-depth inspection. We will thoroughly solve this problem. Personnel Department of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China

    中国人民银行总行已开始调整对专门技术人材的使用
    编辑同志：经过了“三反”运动，我们检查到过去由于我行对员工情况了解得不够全面，调配不适当，致有许多专门技术人材的使用不够合理。“三反”运动后，我们已经根据上级的指示，开始了调整工作。目前，我们还在继续进行调整。七月十七日你报“读者来信”栏刊载的“合理地使用农业技术人员”一文对我行农村金融管理局使用农业技术人员的不合理现象提出批评后，更促使我们重视了这一工作，并立即进行了深入检查。我们当彻底解决这个问题。中国人民银行总行人事处
