    CCP Longyan District Committee of Fujian Establishes System to Strengthen Cadre Newspaper Reading and Study
    Editor: The cadres of the directly subordinate organizations of the Longyan Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Fujian Province generally do not pay attention to reading newspapers and studying. We conducted a current affairs test in thirty-two units. Of the six hundred and thirty-two people who took the test, three hundred and seventy-nine failed. Due to the lack of attention to current affairs and political study, many people not only do not know about major domestic and foreign events, but also do not understand the policies that are directly related to their work. This situation is most serious among cadres in economic and business departments.
    We have already issued a circular based on the results of the test, requiring all agencies to conduct a general review of the newspaper reading and study situation of their staff and to formulate improvement measures. We have stipulated the following measures to strengthen newspaper reading and study: 1. Leading cadres should personally take action to strengthen leadership over cadre newspaper reading and study. 2. Cultivate cadres' interest in reading newspapers and gradually develop the habit of consciously reading newspapers through reports, seminars, tests, and other methods. 3. Establish necessary learning systems.

    中共福建龙岩地委建立制度加强干部读报学习
    编辑同志：福建省龙岩专署直属机关的干部，普遍地不注意读报学习。我们在三十二个单位中举行了一次时事测验。参加测验的六百三十二人竟有三百七十九人不及格。由于不注意时事政治学习，很多人不但不知道国内外的重大事情，而且不懂得和自己的业务有直接关系的政策。这种情况以经济企业部门的干部最为严重。
    我们已经根据测验的结果，发出通报，要求各机关普遍检查机关工作人员的读报学习情况，并订出改进的办法。我们已规定了加强读报学习的办法：一、领导干部亲自动手，加强对干部读报学习的领导。二、通过报告会、座谈会、测验等方式，培养干部读报的兴趣，逐渐养成自觉的读报习惯。三、建立必要的学习制度。
