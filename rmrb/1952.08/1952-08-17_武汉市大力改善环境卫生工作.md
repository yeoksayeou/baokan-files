    Wuhan Vigorously Improves Environmental Sanitation Work
    Before liberation, Wuhan was a city with very poor environmental sanitation. Everywhere was filled with broken bricks and tiles and garbage heaps. In some neighborhoods, due to the excessive accumulation of garbage, the back alleys had to be blocked off, leaving the garbage to rot there. Many open ditches on both sides of the streets were not covered; some sewage pipes had not been cleared for many years. Some manholes of the sewers were missing covers, causing sewage to flow everywhere, with a foul smell permeating the air; some sewers were not smooth, and whenever the river rose or there was heavy rain, the sewage would back up, and some neighborhoods would be submerged by the dirty water from the sewers. In the Hankou area, most areas were filled with cinder or garbage (Houhu), and the Zhongshan Avenue above Liudu Bridge, built across the lake, still had many lake ponds in many places, accumulating sewage. There were also many lakes and ponds in Wuchang and Hanyang.
    After liberation, the People's Government immediately began laying sewers in Youyi Street, Sanyuanli, and other places. From then on, the residents in this area would no longer live in sewage. According to statistics, in the three years after liberation, a total of more than 8,900 meters of sewer trunk lines and more than 1,600 meters of branch lines were laid, and more than 126,000 meters of ditches were dredged. In addition, the Huangxiao River, which drains the sewage, was dredged, and pumping stations were set up along the river and in the Daijiashan area, which basically solved the problem of water accumulation in the urban area. The exit of a sewage pipe on Tianjin Road had not been unblocked for thirty years, and this time it was also unblocked. Open ditches have been gradually converted into covered ditches. The section of Zhongshan Avenue from Jianghan Road to Sanmin Road was converted into covered ditches when the cement pavement was renovated earlier, and the open ditch on Jianghan Road was also converted into a covered ditch long ago. Garbage dumps have been gradually cleared, and the back alleys of each neighborhood (hutong) have been cleared and swept; houses are being repaired separately, with a total of 4,385 houses repaired and newly built in three years; the first batch of staff dormitories has been completed, and the second batch is also planned to start construction. Currently, in coordination with the fire protection campaign, densely populated shantytowns are being evacuated to improve the environment, and 41 new public toilets have been built. These have provided the necessary conditions for improving environmental sanitation. The Municipal People's Government has also gradually established health institutions in various districts, improved the service spirit of medical and nursing personnel, held health exhibitions, and prepared a large number of vaccination materials, providing a guarantee for carrying out the patriotic health campaign on a large scale.
    Wuhan's patriotic health campaign has now entered its second stage. In the first stage, the main focus was on mobilizing the masses extensively, clearing more than 13,700 tons of garbage, more than 780 tons of sludge, dredging more than 79,900 meters of ditches, building more than 1,790 meters of ditches, filling more than 394 ponds, repairing 275 toilets, demolishing and filling 215 unsanitary toilets, and killing more than 800 million flies. In addition, work was carried out to clean water sources and manage cold drinks. The task of the second stage is to eliminate flies, greatly reduce mosquitoes and bedbugs, ensure that there are no bedbugs in public dormitories, and maintain a clean environment.
    The people of the city have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm in the campaign. For example, a 64-year-old woman in Shuangdongmen continuously boiled tea for a week for the neighbors who were repairing ditches; some children killed more than 1,000 flies a day; and worker Le Huabin voluntarily repaired ditches, working continuously for thirteen hours a day. Health workers and teachers and students of various health schools went to the countryside in the rain to carry out health work. Residents of Taoyuanfang cleared sludge and repaired two large ditches with a total length of more than 170 meters; residents of Nianyutao filled a stinky pond, making the nearby river water cleaner, and the residents along the river benefited. In Hanyang, in order to allow fire engines to pass everywhere, some sludge pits and muddy roads have been paved into smooth avenues. Some have also been paved with bluestone pavement. In the city, dealing with the garbage problem is a very difficult problem, but the wisdom and labor of the people have solved this problem. On Zhajia You Road outside the railway, there is a garbage dump that has now become a public square that can accommodate more than 10,000 people, with three street lights installed on it, surrounded by bamboo fences, and a stage in the middle. Every night, groups of children play various games here. In the Chenjia Lake area, three large squares have also appeared, the larger one can accommodate more than 20,000 people, and the smaller one can accommodate more than 10,000 people. Residents often hold meetings here, and at night it is used as a place to cool off. Who would have thought that not long ago, these were garbage dumps?
    The people have also demonstrated creative power in various health works. Comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions created a "bedbug-killing steam furnace" to kill bedbugs with steam. Comrades from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Transportation Company used the "soap water mosquito killing method" to eliminate mosquitoes (mosquitoes are afraid of light and often gather in dark corners during the day. After being sprayed with foam, the mosquito wings stick together and cannot fly, then they are swept out and burned to death).
    In order to turn the blitz work into regular action, some residential groups in the city have formulated patriotic health covenants, and some are still in the process of negotiating. At the same time, some regular systems have also been established. For example, in the fourth district, a system of "sweeping in front of each door" has been established, agreeing to move out together when the garbage truck arrives, cleaning in sections, leaving no garbage; rotating duties by household, responsible for cleaning, and conducting evaluations and inspections on time. Achieving "five cleans": roads, ditches, houses, clothing, and body.

    武汉市大力改善环境卫生工作
    在解放前，武汉是一个环境卫生很不好的城市。到处都是残砖败瓦、垃圾堆。有些里巷，因垃圾堆积过多，只好把后巷封锁，让垃圾堆在那里发臭。许多街两旁的明沟，没有加盖；有的粪管已多年不通。下水道的入孔也有缺盖子的，到处污水横流，臭气薰天；有的下水道不通畅，每逢江河水涨或下大雨时，下水倒泄，有些里巷便给阴沟内的脏水所浸没。汉口方面大部分地区原是用煤渣或垃圾填起来的（后湖），六渡桥以上的中山大路，跨湖建屋，很多地方残存着湖塘，聚积污水。武昌汉阳方面的湖塘也不少。
    解放后人民政府马上着手敷设友益街、三元里等地的下水道。从此，这一带的居民，再不会在污水中过日子了。据统计，解放后三年内总共加铺了下水道干管八千九百多公尺，支管一千六百多公尺，疏浚沟一十二万六千多公尺。此外还疏浚了宣泄下水的黄孝河，在沿江及戴家山地方，设置了抽水机，基本上解决了市区内的积水问题。天津路有一条粪管的出口，整整三十年未通，这一次也被疏通了。明沟已逐步地改为暗沟，中山大道江汉路至三民路一段，早于翻修水泥路面时便改修暗沟，江汉路的明沟，也早已改为暗沟。垃圾堆已逐步清除，各里份（就是胡同）的后巷都已打通、清扫；房屋正分别修复，三年内共修复和新建房屋四千三百八十五栋；第一批职工宿舍已建筑完成，第二批也已计划开工。现正配合消防运动，疏散密集的棚户，改善环境，并新建了公共厕所四十一处。这些都为搞好环境卫生提供了必要的条件。市人民政府并在各区内逐步地建立了卫生机构，提高了医疗护理人员的服务精神；举办过卫生展览，准备了大批预防接种的材料，为大规模地开展爱国卫生运动提供了保证。
    武汉市的爱国卫生运动现已进入第二阶段。在第一阶段，主要是普遍发动了群众，清除了垃圾一万三千七百多吨、污泥七百八十多吨，疏通沟道七万九千九百多公尺，修建沟渠一千七百九十多公尺，填平水塘三百九十四个，修理厕所二百七十五个，拆填不卫生的厕所二百一十五个，扑灭苍蝇八亿多只。此外还进行了清洁水源、管理清凉饮食等工作。第二阶段的任务是消灭苍蝇，大量减少蚊虫和臭虫，做到公共宿舍中没有臭虫，并保持环境清洁。
    全市人民在运动中发挥了高度的积极性，例如双洞门一位六十四岁的老太婆，曾接连为修沟的乡邻烧了一个星期的茶水；有的小朋友一天打了一千多只苍蝇；工人乐华斌，义务修沟，一天连续工作十三小时。卫生人员和各卫生学校的师生，在雨天下乡进行卫生工作。桃源坊居民清除污泥，修好了一百七十多公尺的两条大沟道；鲇鱼套居民填平了一个臭水塘，使附近的河水清洁了，沿河一带的居民都得到好处。在汉阳方面，为了让救火车可以到处通行，已把一些污泥坑和烂泥路铺填成平坦的大道。有的并铺上了青石路面。在城市中，处理垃圾问题，本是一个非常困难的问题，但人民的智慧和劳动，使这一问题获得了解决。在铁路外渣家右路，有一个垃圾场，现在已成为可容万余人的公共广场，上面装有三盏路灯，周围有竹篱，中间有戏台，每天晚上有成群的小朋友在这里进行各种游戏。在陈家湖一带，也出现了三个很大的广场，大的可容二万多人，小的可容一万多人，居民经常在这里开会，晚间还被当作是纳凉的地方。谁会想到在不久以前，这里是些垃圾堆呢？
    人民在各项卫生工作中，还发挥了创造的力量。市总工会的同志，创制了“杀臭虫蒸气炉”，利用蒸气来杀死臭虫。市公安局和市搬运公司的同志，用“肥皂水灭蚊法”消灭蚊虫（蚊子畏光，白天多聚集在黑暗的角落里。经用泡沫喷射，蚊翼粘着，便不能飞动，然后扫出用火烧死）。
    为了使突击的工作变为经常的行动，全市各居民小组有的已订好爱国卫生公约，有的还正在商订。同时还建立了一些经常的制度，如在第四区中，便建立了“各扫门前”的制度，相约于垃圾车到达时一齐出动，分段清扫，不留垃圾；依户轮值，负责清扫，按时进行评定检查。做到道路、沟渠、房屋、衣被、身体等“五净”。
