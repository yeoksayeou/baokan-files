    Urgently Mobilize to Eliminate Pests and Ensure a Bumper Cotton Harvest

    This year, cotton is growing well in various regions, and a bumper harvest is promising. However, major cotton-producing areas such as Hebei, Shaanxi, and Hubei provinces have been widely affected by pests such as cotton aphids and red spiders. These pests are developing very rapidly, and their range of harm is expanding daily. In areas where pests have occurred, one of the most important tasks currently is to compete with the pests for cotton in order to ensure the complete realization of this year's cotton production increase target.

    This year, cotton pests appeared earlier than in previous years, and the area of their spread is also considerable. In order to completely eliminate cotton pests, governments at all levels have already done a lot of work. As early as April this year, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued an "Emergency Notice on Pest Control"; the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government also held special training classes on crop diseases and insect pests in the northern and southern cotton-producing areas in Beijing and Wuhan, respectively; the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government also allocated an additional 200 billion yuan in agricultural pesticide loans, entrusting the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to purchase and prepare pesticides for controlling cotton pests for use by cotton farmers in cotton-growing areas. Thanks to the call and support of the Central People's Government, leading cadres and the vast number of cotton farmers in various cotton-producing areas have paid close attention to the prevention and control of cotton pests. Many cotton-growing areas have launched large-scale campaigns to eliminate pests. This is the fundamental reason why cotton pests have not been able to continue to spread and cotton has generally grown well in the past few months.

    However, after the trend of cotton pest spread was curbed and the cotton plants gradually grew, some leading cadres and cotton farmers in certain cotton-producing areas developed complacency and blind optimism. They believed that the cotton plants had already grown, and cotton pests could no longer harm them; or, based on past experience, cotton pests would not be able to develop after July; some people even believed that even if cotton pests occurred, they would be naturally eliminated by the sun and heavy rain during the hot summer days. Under the control of this thought, they relaxed the work of eliminating cotton pests. Facts have proved that this idea is wrong. Whether in the early stage of cotton growth or in the peak growing season, we must always pay attention to the invasion of cotton pests, and we should carefully inspect, meticulously prevent, and eliminate them at any time. Otherwise, if we wait until the pests spread before carrying out elimination, it will take more effort and yield less results.

    Currently, it is the peak growing season for cotton, and the cotton plants have grown tall, are flowering and forming bolls. From the end of August to the beginning of September, the cotton bolls will begin to fluff. If we cannot quickly eliminate the pests, cotton production will be greatly reduced, or even have no harvest at all. Therefore, in areas where pests have already occurred, leading cadres and the vast number of cotton farmers must urgently mobilize, and quickly and decisively eliminate the pests by various means in the shortest possible time; in cotton-growing areas where pests have not yet been found, leading cadres and the vast number of cotton farmers must quickly overcome complacency and blind optimism, carefully check for the occurrence of pests, and eliminate them immediately upon discovery to ensure this year's bumper cotton harvest.

    紧急动员起来，扑灭害虫，保证棉花丰收
    今年各地棉花生长良好，丰收大有希望。但是，河北、陕西、湖北等主要产棉区，普遍发生了棉蚜、红蜘蛛等害虫。这些害虫发展十分迅速，为害范围日益扩大。在害虫发生地区，当前最主要的工作之一是和害虫争夺棉花，以便保证今年棉花增产任务彻底实现。
    今年棉花害虫发生的时间比往年为早，其蔓延的地区也相当大。为了彻底消灭棉花害虫，各级人民政府已经作了许多工作。早在今年四月，中央人民政府政务院就发布了“关于防治害虫的紧急通知”；中央人民政府农业部又在北京和武汉分别举办了北方、南方棉产区病虫害专题训练班；中央财政经济委员会并增拨了农药贷款二千亿元，委托全国合作总社购备除治棉虫农药，供应棉区农民使用。由于中央人民政府的号召和支持，各产棉区的领导干部和广大棉农十分注意防治棉花害虫，许多棉区开展了大规模的除治虫害运动，这是过去数月来棉花害虫所以没有能够继续蔓延和棉花普遍生长良好的根本原因。
    但是，在棉花害虫蔓延的趋势被遏止和棉株逐渐长大以后，某些产棉区的领导干部和棉农竟产生了麻痹大意和盲目乐观思想，他们认为棉株已经长大，棉花害虫已经不能为害了；或者说，根据往年经验，在七月以后棉花害虫就不能发展了；有些人甚至认为即使发生了棉花害虫，经过伏天的太阳晒，大雨打，也会自然消灭。在这种思想支配下，他们就放松了除治棉花害虫的工作。事实证明，这种思想是错误的。不论是在棉花生长幼期，或是在棉花生长盛期，都要经常注意棉花害虫的侵袭，应该认真检查，周密防范，随时发现，随时消灭，否则等到害虫蔓延开来，再进行除治，那就费力大而收效小了。
    目前正是棉花生长盛期，棉棵都已长大，正在开花结铃，八月底到九月初，棉桃就要开絮了。如果不能把害虫迅速扑灭，棉花就要大大减产，甚至毫无收成。因此，在已经发生害虫的地区，领导干部和广大棉农必须紧急动员起来，在最短的时间内，迅速地坚决地用各种办法把害虫消灭干净；在还未发现害虫的棉区，领导干部和广大棉农必须迅速克服麻痹大意和盲目乐观的思想，认真检查有无害虫的发生情况，一有发现，即行消灭，保证今年的棉花丰收。
