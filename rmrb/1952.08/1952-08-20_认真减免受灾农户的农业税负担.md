Conscientiously Reduce and Exempt Disaster-stricken Farmers from Agricultural Tax Burden

The "Measures for Reducing and Exempting Agricultural Tax for Disaster-stricken Farmers" promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government on August 14th is a unified principle that must be followed in agricultural tax reduction and exemption work throughout the country. It is an important component of the people's government's agricultural tax policy. We have always done this, and we must continue to do so now.

In the past three years, the Central People's Government has vigorously led the masses of farmers to actively fight disasters and prevent harm, build water conservancy projects, and carry out huge projects such as harnessing the Huai River and diverting floods from the Jing River, guaranteeing the income of millions of acres of farmland and the lives of millions of farmers. However, due to the vastness of our country's territory and the low level of our current scientific development, our agricultural production cannot yet completely overcome natural disasters. Even under conditions of national bumper harvests, individual regions may still suffer from natural disasters. Therefore, taking care of farmers whose harvests are reduced due to disasters, so that their lives and production are not affected by the burden of agricultural taxes, is still a very important matter. Our principle for levying agricultural tax is "surveying fields to determine output, calculating tax based on rates, and reducing and exempting taxes according to law." Surveying fields to determine output is the basis for calculating tax based on rates and reducing and exempting taxes according to law, and calculating tax based on rates and reducing and exempting taxes according to law are indispensable methods. Neglecting any of these methods will cause the burden of agricultural tax to become unevenly distributed. The principle for reducing and exempting agricultural tax for disaster-stricken farmers is "light disaster, less reduction; heavy disaster, more reduction; especially light, no reduction; especially heavy, full exemption." Article 3 of the measures divides disaster-stricken farmers into five grades according to the severity of the disaster, and stipulates that no reduction shall be granted for those whose harvest is reduced by less than 20%; more reduction shall be granted for those whose harvest is reduced by 40% to less than 60%; and full exemption shall be granted for those whose harvest is reduced by more than 60%. Article 5 of the measures further stipulates that greater care should be given to areas that have been hit by disasters for more than two consecutive years. Such provisions are completely reasonable. This is a further appropriate relaxation of the standards for reduction and exemption in the past. This approach will further encourage farmers' enthusiasm for fighting disasters. Article 6 of the measures stipulates that "for the same land and the same type of crops, suffering the same and equal degree of disaster, the same percentage of reduced harvest should be calculated. Those who have reduced the degree of disaster by actively fighting the disaster should still be calculated according to the same percentage of reduced harvest, and their reduction and exemption percentage should not be lowered; if the disaster situation is aggravated due to negligence in fighting the disaster, it should also be calculated according to the same percentage of reduced harvest, and their reduction percentage should not be increased." Such provisions are closely coordinated with our policies for agricultural production, and all regions must correctly grasp them in implementation.

The method for calculating the reduction and exemption of agricultural tax for disaster-stricken farmers is calculated once a year based on households. Article 2 of the measures stipulates that "the agricultural tax of disaster-stricken farmers shall be reduced or exempted separately according to the percentage of reduced harvest of all crops of the household throughout the year." Article 4 of the measures stipulates that "for summer crops that are reduced due to disasters, a part or all of the tax may be postponed during the summer requisition, and when the autumn requisition is made, the reduced yield of the summer and autumn seasons shall be combined to calculate the percentage of the annual reduced harvest, and the reduction or exemption shall be made separately according to the provisions of the previous article (i.e., Article 3)." Such provisions not only conform to the principle of calculating the tax amount based on households in agricultural tax collection, but also are more adaptable to the actual affordability of farmers and more fair and reasonable than the "calculating reduction and exemption by land plot" and "summer reduction for summer, autumn reduction for autumn" methods implemented in some areas in the past. At present, some regions may have difficulties in implementing this calculation method due to historical habits or other special circumstances, and temporary uniformity should not be forced. However, the calculation principle stipulated in the measures is correct, and all regions without special difficulties should strive to implement it in order to gradually achieve the uniformity of the calculation methods for agricultural tax reduction and exemption throughout the country.

The prerequisite for doing a good job in agricultural tax reduction and exemption work is to grasp the basic spirit and calculation methods of the measures for reducing and exempting agricultural tax for disaster-stricken farmers. Cadres of the financial departments of governments at all levels should study and discuss these measures to ensure their correct implementation and prevent possible deviations in work. In the past, some deviations have occurred in the agricultural tax reduction and exemption work in various regions, the most common of which is the deviation of "contracting for reduction and exemption." That is, regardless of the actual disaster situation, the amount of reduction and exemption is distributed level by level, and the amount of reduction and exemption is contracted level by level. As a result, the reduction and exemption are improper, those who should be reduced more are reduced less, and those who should not be reduced are reduced more; and the state's financial revenue has also suffered a certain loss. This is completely contrary to the basic spirit of our measures for reducing and exempting agricultural tax for disaster-stricken farmers. There are also some cadres in some areas who in the past had some "benevolent government views" of exaggerating the disaster situation or reducing and exempting taxes evenly, as well as "purely financial views" of concealing the disaster situation and not daring to let go of reduction and exemption. These have all caused, to varying degrees, uneven distribution of the burden of agricultural tax, and must be thoroughly corrected.

We hope that the tax collection cadres of the financial departments at all levels will earnestly do a good job in surveying disasters, evaluating disasters, calculating the amount of tax reduction and exemption, filling out and issuing reduction and exemption certificates, and statistical reporting, etc., in accordance with the provisions of Articles 7, 8, and 9 of the now promulgated measures for reducing and exempting agricultural tax for disaster-stricken farmers. In particular, it is necessary to do a good job in the investigation of the disaster situation, truly grasp the disaster situation, have a clear understanding in mind, and with a high sense of responsibility, earnestly do a good job in the reduction and exemption of agricultural tax completely in accordance with the provisions of the measures for reducing and exempting agricultural tax for disaster-stricken farmers.

### 认真减免受灾农户的农业税负担

    认真减免受灾农户的农业税负担
    中央人民政府政务院八月十四日公布的受灾农户农业税减免办法，是全国各地在农业税的减免工作中必须依据的统一的原则。它是人民政府的农业税收政策中的重要组成部分，我们从来都这样做，现在更要继续这样做。
    近三年来，中央人民政府用大力领导农民群众积极抗灾防害，兴修水利，进行根治淮河、荆江分洪等巨大工程，保障了千百万亩农田的收益和千百万农民的生活，但由于我国国土广大和我们目前科学水平的低下，致现时我国的农业生产还不能完全克服自然的灾害，即使在全国性的丰收情况之下，个别地区还可能遭受自然灾害的袭击，因此照顾因灾歉收的农户，使他们的生活和生产不致因农业税的负担而遭受影响，还是非常重要的一件事情。我们征收农业税的原则是“查田定产、依率计征、依法减免”。查田定产是依率计征和依法减免的基础，而依率计征和依法减免是不可偏废的办法。忽视了任何一项办法，都会使农业税的负担发生畸轻畸重的现象。受灾农户农业税减免的原则是“轻灾少减，重灾多减，特轻不减、特重全免”。办法第三条把受灾农户依其受灾程度的轻重，分为五等，并规定了歉收不到二成者不减；歉收四成以上不到六成者多减；歉收六成以上者全免。办法的第五条又规定了对连续受灾二年以上的地区，予以更大的照顾。这样的规定，是完全合理的。这比起过去各地减免的尺度是进一步适当放宽了的。这个办法将更加鼓励农民抗灾的积极性。办法第六条规定“同等土地，同类作物，遭受同样和同等程度的灾害，应按同一歉收成数计算。其因积极抗灾而减轻受灾程度者，仍照同一歉收成数计算，不降低其减免成数；如因怠于抗灾而致灾情加重者，亦应照同一歉收成数计算，不提高其减征成数。”这样的规定，是和我们对于农业生产的政策密切配合的，各地在执行中必须加以正确的掌握。
    受灾农户农业税减免的计算方法，是以户为单位全年一次计算的。办法第二条规定：“受灾农户的农业税依该户全年全部农作物歉收成数，分别减征或免征”。办法第四条规定：“夏季作物因灾歉收者，在夏征时，得酌情缓征一部或全部，俟秋征时，再按夏、秋两季歉收的产量合并算出全年歉收成数，依前条（即第三条）规定分别减免之”。这样的规定，不但符合于农业税征收以户为单位计算税额的原则，而且比过去有些地区所实行的“按地块计算减免”及“夏减夏、秋减秋”的方法更能适应农户的实际负担能力，更为公平合理。目前某些地区，由于历史习惯或其他特殊情况的限制，在执行这种计算方法如有困难暂时亦不应强求统一。但办法规定的计算原则是对的，凡是没有特殊困难的地区，都应争取贯彻执行，以求逐渐达到全国各地农业税减免的计算方法的统一。
    作好农业税减免工作的先决条件，是掌握受灾农户农业税减免办法的基本精神及其计算方法。各级人民政府财政部门的干部，都应该对这个办法进行学习讨论，以保证它的正确执行、防止工作上可能发生的偏向。过去各地的农业税减免工作，曾经发生过一些偏向，其中最普遍的是“减免包干”的偏向。这就是不管实际灾情如何，逐级分配减免数额，逐级把减免数额包揽下来。其结果是减免不当，应多减者少减，不应减者却多减了；并使国家财政收入，也受了一定的损失。这和我们对受灾农户农业税减免办法的基本精神，是完全抵触的。还有一些地区的干部，过去在执行减免工作中有些夸大灾情或平均减免的“仁政观点”，也有匿报灾情及不敢放手减免的“单纯财政观点”，这些都曾或大或小地引起了农业税负担上的畸轻畸重现象，都必须加以彻底纠正。
    我们希望各级财政部门的税收工作干部，实事求是地依照现在公布的受灾农户农业税减免办法第七、第八、第九各条的规定，认真做好勘灾、评灾、计算减免税额、填发减免证及统计上报等工作。特别要作好灾情的调查工作，确实掌握灾情，作到心中有数，以高度负责的态度，完全依照受灾农户农业税减免办法的规定，认真作好农业税的减免工作。
