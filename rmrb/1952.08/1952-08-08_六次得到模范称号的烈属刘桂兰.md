    Liu Guilan, a Martyr's Relative Who Has Received the Model Title Six Times

    To the Editor: Liu Guilan, the mother of martyr Zhang Yaoxiao of a volunteer army unit, has received the titles of model martyr's relative and model woman worker of Zhangjiakou city and municipal level for six consecutive times.

    Liu Guilan has a high degree of political consciousness. In various movements, she is an active supporter and propagandist of the Party's policies. She took the lead in participating in the peace signature campaign and the donation campaign. When the Marriage Law was vigorously implemented, she helped some women dissolve unreasonable marital relationships. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, she conducted propaganda to more than 30,000 people. In response to the call of the People's Government to eliminate illiteracy, she was the first to sign up for the people's school and mobilized women to participate. In the people's school, she is a model of the study mutual aid group. She originally only knew four or five hundred characters, but now she knows more than two thousand characters and can write letters and articles. In the past six months, she has organized more than 100 people, including the masses and the families of martyrs and soldiers, to participate in production work such as sewing leather, making shoe soles, and sewing buttons, which has solved the livelihood difficulties of the masses and the families of martyrs and soldiers. In her work, she often says to everyone: "If we do a good job in production, we will increase the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea." There is a saying among the masses: "Liu Guilan is a banner for women's production. Wherever the banner goes, women's production will flourish." Now, Liu Guilan is a member of the Zhangjiakou City Second District People's Political Consultative Conference, a member of the Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, and is responsible for production in her street, as well as work related to the families of martyrs and soldiers, and the Democratic Women's Federation.

    If you ask Liu Guilan why she works so actively, she will tell you: "I want to serve the people wholeheartedly and always maintain the glorious title of model martyr's family member. I want to work hard to support the Volunteer Army, avenge my son, and avenge the sacrificed Chinese and Korean people." Wang Xinguo

    六次得到模范称号的烈属刘桂兰
    编辑同志：志愿军某部烈士张耀孝的母亲刘桂兰，曾经连续六次得到张家口市区、市级烈军属模范和妇女劳动模范的称号。
    刘桂兰有着高度的政治觉悟。在各种运动中，她都是党的政策的积极支持者和宣传者。她曾带头参加了和平签名运动和捐献运动。在大张旗鼓地贯彻执行婚姻法时，她帮助某些妇女解除了不合理的婚姻关系。“三反”、“五反”运动中，她向三万多人进行了宣传。在人民政府扫除文盲的号召下，她首先报名上民校，并动员妇女们参加。在民校中，她是学习互助组的模范。她原来只认识四、五百字，现在已认识两千多字，能写信、写稿了。半年来，她组织了群众和烈军属共一百多人参加缝皮子、纳鞋底、锁衣扣等生产工作，解决了群众和烈军属们的生活困难。在工作中，她常对大家说：“我们搞好生产，就给抗美援朝增加了力量。”群众中有一种反映：“刘桂兰是一面妇女生产大旗。大旗到那里，那里的妇女生产就大搞起来了。”现在，刘桂兰是张家口市第二区人民协商委员会委员，市民主妇女联合会委员，并负责她本街道的生产以及烈军属、民主妇女联合会等方面的工作。
    如果你问刘桂兰为什么这样积极工作，她会告诉你：“我要全心全意为人民服务，永远保持模范烈士家属的光荣称号。我要努力支援志愿军，为我儿子报仇，为牺牲了的中朝人民报仇。”    王新国
