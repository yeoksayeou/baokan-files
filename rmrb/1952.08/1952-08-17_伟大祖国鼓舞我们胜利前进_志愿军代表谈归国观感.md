Great Motherland Inspires Us to Advance Victoriously
--Volunteer Army Representatives Discuss Impressions of Returning Home
    Jin Feng

    Among the representatives of the Volunteer Army returning home to visit and attend the "August 1st" Sports Meeting, there are some regimental-level and above cadres who have been in combat for a long time. They were so calm and composed when dealing with the enemy on the battlefield, but they were moved by the enthusiasm of the people of the capital who welcomed them. Deputy Political Commissar Li of a certain army is already a middle-aged man. When he recalled the scene at the Beijing Railway Station, his eyes radiated excitement and youthful brilliance. He smiled and said, "The people lifted us up, and the children dressed us up with red scarves." Political Commissar Wang of a certain engineering regiment walked at the back of the line, and people warmly asked him, "Comrade, have you worked hard in Korea?" One day he went to the Working People's Cultural Palace, where many workers and students were doing group dances. As soon as they saw that he was a volunteer soldier, a worker ran over and asked him to dance. He was a porter from Yongdingmen, and he asked him anxiously if he could take him to Korea, because he had applied several times but had not been able to go. Political Commissar Wang said calmly, "How can you not love such people from the bottom of your heart and fight to the end for them?"

    On the Korean battlefield, they received a steady stream of supplies from the people of the motherland; upon returning to the motherland, from Shenyang to Beijing, they saw cheerful faces and neat clothes everywhere, and construction everywhere. When Deputy Commander Liu of a certain army left Beijing two years ago, the area near Dongdan Square was still a market of stalls; now when he came back, rows of tall buildings stood there. In the suburbs, where there used to be sorghum and corn fields, there are now red and gray buildings one after another. In particular, the patriotic health campaign in the motherland surprised them. In Korea, they heard that there were few flies and mosquitoes in Beijing, and they always wanted to see this miracle with their own eyes. When they came back and saw that it was really like this, everyone was extremely happy. Deputy Commander Liu's wife is older and did not know how to read before. This time, when she came back, she asked him to correct her arithmetic, because she had been studying culture every day, and even his seventy-year-old mother wanted to study. In Dong'an Market, he saw a shoeshine boy pick up a fan, shout two or three times without anyone responding, and then report it to the group leader who was with him. The group leader told him to hand the fan over to the police. Deputy Commander Liu said that from this small incident, he not only saw the new atmosphere and new morality of society, but also saw that the working people of Beijing were completely organized and living happily.

    Talking about the "August 1st" Sports Meeting, they believed that it fully demonstrated the brave, resolute, quick-witted, united, and humble learning, and constantly progressive traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and would strongly promote the sports and cultural work of the Volunteer Army. Deputy Political Commissar Li said: Although it is impossible to carry out sports activities on a large scale like in the country on the front lines in Korea, sports activities suitable for war training, such as wooden horses, parallel bars, tug-of-war, and motorcycle competitions, can be done. After returning, we must vigorously promote it. Regarding cultural learning, they believe that the People's Liberation Army has already taken a big step ahead of them. They believe that it is difficult to build a modern national defense army without a certain cultural foundation. In fact, the soldiers like to study culture very much, and the cadres are also very eager to learn. The Volunteer Army has long felt this problem—illiteracy or low cultural level increases the difficulty of mastering modern military science and technology. They are prepared to organize learning in a planned way during the gaps in combat after they return.

    Deputy Director Wang of the Propaganda Department of the Volunteer Army Political Department believes that the literary and artistic performances of the conference were very successful. He said: The performances of the fraternal units of the People's Liberation Army are equivalent to introducing to the Volunteer Army the tasks, characteristics, heroic actions, and achievements of the PLA units in serving national defense construction and economic construction. For example, the Southwest troops demonstrated the bravery and hardship of marching into Tibet and the historical facts of the support of the people of all ethnic groups for the People's Liberation Army; the Central South troops demonstrated their defense of the southern gate of the motherland, learning culture, improving technology, and training to become a modern national defense army. The Air Force and Navy units each demonstrated the growth of the People's Air Force and Navy. And overall, they all demonstrated the implementation of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy of serving the soldiers. In terms of creative forms, it also gave great inspiration to the literary and artistic workers of the Volunteer Army. The forms are diverse, the singing is lively and natural, and it fully expresses the happy and optimistic spirit of the people's army. The attitude of earnestly absorbing the cultural characteristics of ethnic minorities and the national heritage is also worth learning.

    They talked with even greater excitement about the news that the financial and economic situation of the motherland has fundamentally improved. Deputy Political Commissar Li said, "This makes us even more confident in the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea." He talked about the heavy industry construction first carried out by the country, which will be directly related to the strength of national defense construction and the growth of a modern army. He talked about how our army has always used inferior equipment to deal with enemies whose equipment is stronger than ours, but has still defeated the enemy; in the future, our equipment will be strengthened, and if we learn culture and master technology, we will surely achieve greater victories. Deputy Director Wang of the Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army Headquarters said in reference to economic construction: For many years, the Chinese working people have worked hard every year, and the wealth they created has been plundered and exploited by imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, landlords, and bureaucrats. Only two or three years after the national liberation, the country's revenue and expenditure reached a balance. After that, building on this foundation, the new China will get better year after year.

    Regarding these great joys of the motherland, they all said that they must quickly organize propaganda and relay the news after returning. Deputy Political Commissar Li said: On the front lines in Korea, the soldiers are most willing and love to hear news from the motherland; as long as someone comes from the motherland, they always feel extraordinarily cordial. Everything sent by the people of the motherland is good, and many people keep the condolence bags and are reluctant to use them. The last time the delegation returning to the country gave a report on the front line, it was more powerful than any mobilization. After listening to the report, the soldiers and cadres discussed how they had not understood the motherland enough in the past, and how they should respond to the people of the motherland in the future. Everyone formulated plans for combat, work, and study around the report. They believe that this time they will bring such good news to the soldiers, and they believe that the Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield will create even greater victories, and will certainly live up to the expectations of the great motherland and the expectations of the great people of the motherland.

    伟大祖国鼓舞我们胜利前进
    ——志愿军代表谈归国观感
    金凤
    在志愿军归国参观“八一”体育运动大会的代表团中，有一部分久经战斗的团级以上干部。他们在战场上和敌人周旋是那样冷静、沉着，但却被首都人民欢迎他们的热情激动了。某军的李副政委已经是一个中年人了，当他回忆起刚到北京车站的那个场面时，眼睛里放射出兴奋，年青的光辉。他笑着说：“老百姓把我们都抬了起来，孩子们把我们都用红领巾打扮起来了。”工兵某团的王政委走在队伍的后面，人们亲热地问他：“同志，你在朝鲜辛苦了吧？”一天他上劳动人民文化宫，许多工人、学生在那里跳集体舞，一看到他是志愿军，一个工人就跑过来请他跳舞。他是永定门的一个搬运工人，他很着急地问他能不能带他到朝鲜去，他自己要求过几次都没有去成。王政委沉静地说：“这样的人民，你能不从心底里爱他们，为他们战斗到底吗？”
    在朝鲜战场上，他们接到祖国人民支援的源源不绝的物资；回到祖国，从沈阳到北京，他们到处看到的是喜气洋洋的脸和干净整齐的衣服，到处看到的是建设。某军的刘副军长两年前离开北京时，东单广场附近还是一片摊贩市场；现在回来一看，一排排高大的楼房矗立在那里了。郊外，以前尽是高粱地、棒子地，现在却是一栋接一栋的红色和灰色的楼房。特别是祖国的爱国卫生运动使他们惊讶。在朝鲜他们听说北京很少有苍蝇蚊子，总想亲眼看看这个奇迹，回来一看真是这样，大家高兴得了不得。刘副军长的妻子年纪比较大，以前不认得字。这次回来竟要求他给她改算术，原来她已经每天在学文化，连他七十多岁的母亲也想去学习。在东安市场，他看到一个擦皮鞋的拾了一把扇子，吆喝了两三声没有人答理，就去报告同在一起的组长，组长让他把扇子交给警察。刘副军长说，从这一件小事情，他不但看到社会的新风气、新道德，更看到北京的劳动人民完全组织起来，正愉快地生活着。
    谈到这次“八一”体育运动大会，他们认为充分表现人民解放军勇敢、坚毅、机敏、团结和虚心学习、不断进取的传统，对志愿军体育文化工作将起有力的推动作用。李副政委说：在朝鲜前线虽然不可能像国内那样大规模地开展体育运动，但适合战争锻炼的体育活动像木马、单双杠、拔河、摩托竞赛等是可以作的。回去以后一定要好好地提倡。关于文化学习，他们认为解放军已经比他们先走一大步。他们认为建设现代化国防军没有一定文化基础是很困难的。事实上战士们是很喜欢学习文化的，干部们对学习要求也很迫切。志愿军里也早已经感觉到这个问题—不识字或文化程度太低，增加了掌握现代化军事科学技术的困难。他们回去准备有计划地利用战斗空隙来组织学习。
    志愿军政治部宣传部王副部长认为大会的文艺观摩表演是很有成绩的。他说：人民解放军各兄弟部队的演出，等于给志愿军介绍了解放军各部队的任务、特点、英雄行为和为国防建设经济建设服务的成就。如西南部队表现了进军西藏的英勇、艰苦，各族人民支援解放军的史实；中南部队表现了他们捍卫祖国南大门，学习文化、提高技术、锻炼为现代化国防军的过程。空军、海军部队各各表现了人民空军、海军的成长。而总的则都表现了贯彻毛主席为兵服务的文艺方针。在创作形式上也给志愿军文艺工作者很大启发。形式多种多样，演唱活泼自然，充分表现出人民部队愉快、乐观的精神。认真地吸取少数民族文化特点和民族遗产的态度，也是值得学习的。
    他们带着更大的兴奋谈到祖国财经情况根本好转的消息。李副政委说：“这使我们对抗美援朝胜利前途更充满了信心。”他谈到国家首先进行的重工业建设，将直接关系到国防建设的力量，关系到现代化军队的成长。他谈到我们的军队从来是以较差的装备来对待装备比我们强的敌人，但还是战胜了敌人；以后我们的装备加强，学习文化掌握技术，一定会取得更大的胜利。志愿军总部政治部宣传部王副部长谈到经济建设说：多少年来中国劳动人民年年辛劳，创造的财富都是被帝国主义、国民党反动派、地主、官僚掠夺和压榨去。全国解放以后仅仅两三年，国家的收支达到了平衡。以后在这基础上来建设，新中国会一年比一年好。
    关于祖国的这些大喜事，他们都说回去后一定要很快地组织宣传，传达。李副政委说：在朝鲜前线战士最愿意、最爱听的是祖国的消息；只要是祖国来的人，总觉得分外亲热。祖国人民送来的什么东西都是好的，许多人保存着慰问袋，舍不得用。上次归国代表团回到前线去作报告，比什么动员力量都大。听了报告以后，战士们、干部们都讨论着过去对祖国怎么认识不够，今后要如何回答祖国人民，大家都围绕着报告订出战斗、工作和学习的计划。这次回去把这样的好消息带给战士，他们相信在朝鲜战场上的志愿军一定会创造更大的胜利，一定不会辜负伟大祖国的期待，不辜负伟大祖国人民的期待。
