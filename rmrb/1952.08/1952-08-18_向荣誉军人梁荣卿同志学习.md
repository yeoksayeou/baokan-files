    Learn From Comrade Liang Rongqing, Honored Serviceman

    Comrade Liang Rongqing was originally a soldier in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and a member of the Communist Youth League. He earned seven minor merits on the Korean front. During the Second Battle, the bone in his lower right leg joint was broken, and he still feels pain when walking long distances.

    After demobilization, in late May of this year, he took a job as a general affairs worker at the Eighth District United Consumer Cooperative in Beijing. In his work, he demonstrated the same brave and tenacious fighting spirit. Once, a fan in the First Store of the district's cooperative broke down. Sending it out for repair would cost money and take a long time, so he decided to learn the structural principles of the fan. He painstakingly explored and studied during his lunch breaks, and carefully pondered it in bed at night, finally understanding the fan's structural principles clearly. Later, when fans broke down, he repaired them himself, quickly and well. When the Eighth District Cooperative renovated the First and Second Stores and five distribution points, he installed the fans, sun lamps, light bulbs, and wiring himself. Due to overwork, his right foot swelled up again. Leaders asked him to rest, but he refused. He said, "The Korean front was much more difficult than this. Although I am disabled, the fighting spirit of the Volunteer Army will never be disabled. Wherever I go, I will bring it with me. Doing a good job is like hitting the enemy. If I don't do this, how can I be worthy of the Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation of us!"

    In addition to doing his own job well, Comrade Liang Rongqing also helped other comrades with purchasing and miscellaneous tasks. Under his influence, everyone's enthusiasm for work was even higher. Many comrades said: We must learn the fighting spirit of the Volunteer Army!

### 向荣誉军人梁荣卿同志学习

    向荣誉军人梁荣卿同志学习
    梁荣卿同志原来是志愿军某部的一个战士，青年团员，在朝鲜前线立过七次小功。他在第二次战役中，右下肢关节骨被打断，直到现在，一走远路就感到疼痛。
    复员后，今年五月下旬，他到北京市第八区联合消费合作社担任总务工作。在工作中，他同样表现了勇敢、顽强的战斗精神。有一次，该区联社第一门市部的一个电扇坏了，送到外面去修理，既要花钱，又要花很长时间，他就决心学习电扇的构造原理。他利用中午的休息时间苦心摸索和钻研，晚间躺在床上也仔细推敲，终于把电扇的构造原理弄得清清楚楚。后来电扇坏了，都由他自己来修理，又快又好。第八区联社整修第一、第二门市部和五个分销处时，电扇、太阳灯、球灯、电线等，都是他自己安装的。由于过于劳累，他的右脚又肿胀了。领导同志让他休息，他也不肯。他说：“朝鲜前线上可比这艰苦得多了，我虽然残废了，志愿军的那种战斗精神可永远不会残废，我到那里，就把它带到那里。搞好工作，就等于打击了敌人。不这样，怎能对得起党和毛主席对我们的培养！”
    梁荣卿同志除了搞好自己的工作外，还帮助其他同志作采购、勤杂工作。在他的影响下，大家的工作积极性都更高了。许多同志都说：要学习志愿军的战斗精神！    北京市合作总社通讯组
