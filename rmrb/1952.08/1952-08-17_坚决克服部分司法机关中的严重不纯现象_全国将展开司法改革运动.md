Resolutely Overcome the Serious Impurity Phenomenon in Some Judicial Organs
National Judicial Reform Movement to be Launched

[This Newspaper News] Currently, judicial reform work is being planned and prepared across the country. East China has already started reform in the People's Courts at the provincial and municipal levels, and has gained preliminary experience; the rectification and transformation of the People's Courts of Fujian Province and cities, etc., have already achieved preliminary results. Other major administrative regions have also launched or are preparing to launch this reform work. At the same time, the Communist Party organizations of the central political and legal organs are focusing on opposing old legal viewpoints as the main content of Party rectification, focusing on ideological review, and achieving cooperation within and outside the Party to launch criticism and self-criticism within the Party, expose and criticize old legal viewpoints, and further promote this reform movement.

For more than two years, the people's judicial organs at all levels have effectively protected the interests of the people and severely cracked down on the enemy in mass movements such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and in various tasks of handling internal disputes among the people, thereby consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. The work of the people's judicial organs has achieved certain results and has made many creations. However, the great "Three-Anti" movement has also exposed many serious phenomena of political and organizational impurity in some people's judicial organs, as well as the bad thoughts and styles of some judicial workers. Some people's judicial organs, because they were manipulated and corrupted by a small number of bad elements and personnel with strong old legal viewpoints, directly caused the evil consequences of condoning the enemy, undermining the rule of law, and harming the interests of the country and the people.

The common and prominent problem exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement is the embezzlement, perversion of justice, and violation of laws and regulations by some judicial workers, especially those retained personnel and bad elements from the old judicial system. Among the embezzlers discovered in the courts that have undergone "Three-Anti" struggles in East China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and Southwest China, former judicial personnel account for the majority. They not only embezzled and accepted bribes, but also sheltered counter-revolutionaries, sheltered illegal bourgeois elements, oppressed the masses, extorted, and committed serious violations of laws and regulations. The fact that the Supreme People's Court last winter exposed the embezzlement and perversion of justice by Shi Jinghou, a clerk of the court, and Gu Yushang, who assisted in adjudication work (both former judicial personnel), is an example. While working in the People's Court, they engaged in black market lawyering activities outside. Shi Jinghou set up so-called "liaison stations" in Beijing and Tianjin, and carried out organized activities of soliciting bribes and practicing favoritism. In handling the case of the debt dispute between the state-owned Beijing Machine Factory and the private merchant Wen Tongxiang Iron Factory, Gu Yushang favored the illegal private merchant and agreed to reduce half of the repayment amount as an exchange condition for embezzlement. Gu Yushang defended the Wen Tongxiang Iron Factory at the court deliberation meeting, causing the court to make a wrong judgment and causing serious losses to state property.

In some people's judicial organs, some bad elements who had served the reactionaries for a long time and committed many evils were also mixed in, and even counter-revolutionaries who had consistently been enemies of the people. Five of the six judges of the Shenyang Municipal People's Court were retained former judicial personnel, some of whom were "four-dynasty veterans" who had served the Northern Warlords, the Kuomintang, the Japanese puppet regime, and the Kuomintang. Three deputy directors of the Yunnan Provincial People's Court were culprits who were anti-communist and anti-people. One was the "Chief Prosecutor of the Special Criminal Court" of the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Jinan; one was the "Military Judge of the Yudong Forward Army and Xuchang Garrison Command" of the Chiang Kai-shek gang; and one was a Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau agent (all have been detained). When such a group of people mixed into the people's judicial organs, the people were greatly dissatisfied with the people's judicial organs. The people in some areas sarcastically satirized them as the "Four Helps and Five No's": One helps counter-revolutionaries harm the people; two helps feudal landlords oppress peasants; three helps illegal bourgeois elements undermine national construction and oppress workers; four helps various illegal elements get away with their crimes. As for the complaints of the working people, they are not accepted, cases are not transmitted, there are no interrogations, no judgments, and no executions.

The erosion of the reactionary old legal viewpoints on the people's judicial organs is even more widespread. Judicial workers with old legal viewpoints do not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves in handling cases, and treat the enemy as friends. They distort and manipulate so-called "statute of limitations," "attempted crime," or "young," "old," and other lies to exonerate or reduce the guilt of counter-revolutionaries. A judge with extremely deep old legal viewpoints in the Nanjing Municipal People's Court said when handling a case of a local tyrant landlord killing a farmer before liberation: "It has expired and will not be processed." A judicial officer with old legal viewpoints in Fujian Province and county believed that a farmer who killed a local tyrant agent before liberation had a "blood debt" and sentenced him to punishment. People with strong old legal viewpoints generally shelter and help illegal bourgeois elements in handling cases involving public-private relations and labor-capital disputes. The Hengyang Railway Administration Engineering Section of Hunan Province contracted the construction of twelve water pipe projects with a total of 201 sections to private merchants Jiyue and Xiehe Construction Plants, agreeing to deliver the work in three weeks. As a result, not only was the work delayed by three weeks, hindering traffic, but also due to the serious cutting corners by the contractors, 54 sections of the water pipe burst after the traffic was opened, causing serious losses to the state. However, Zhou Chonggang, a judge of the Hengyang Municipal People's Court (former judicial personnel), favored the two construction plants and ruled that the Engineering Section should be responsible for two-thirds of the responsibility, and the private merchants should only be responsible for one-third of the responsibility. When this case was appealed to the Hunan Provincial People's Court, another former judicial personnel, although he changed the ruling to hold the construction plant fully responsible, excused the crime of illegal capitalists stealing state property on the grounds that "the political consciousness of businessmen is not high, and they are completely considering their own interests and unintentionally causing losses," and exempted them from criminal responsibility for undermining national economic construction. As for handling marriage cases, judicial workers with old legal viewpoints generally do not support the just struggles of young men and women for freedom of marriage, and tolerate criminals who persecute women. Gao Xiancai, a hired worker in Liuan County, Anhui Province, fell in love with the "adopted daughter" of landlord Wei Guangxing and was killed by the landlord at night for being "caught in adultery." However, the judge Sun Lu (former judicial personnel) regarded the two people's legitimate free love affair as a crime of "climbing over the wall to follow" and "interfering with the family" (that is, interfering with the feudal order of the landlord), and defended the landlord's crime of murder.

Judicial workers with old legal viewpoints are seriously divorced from the masses in their work, handle cases in isolation, do not conduct investigations and research, and make wrong judgments based on subjective assumptions. Their work style is "thrusting judge-ism," often incorrectly and without principle emphasizing "no handling without complaint," "no handling without a complaint," "no handling without sufficient evidence," "no handling if the parties are not qualified," "no handling if the jurisdiction area does not match," "civil matters are not handled criminally," and "criminal matters are not handled civilly," emphasizing "litigation procedures," and refusing to solve the actual problems of the masses that should be concerned about, pushing cases whenever possible, dragging them on whenever possible, with no political responsibility. As for the bad style of glaring at the masses, full of official jargon, it is even more common. An old man in Beijing who was "filing a lawsuit" originally had a lot more to say, but only because he couldn't understand the judge's "legal language": "Do you have any 'appeals'?" (The old man asked the judge several times without getting an explanation), so he had to say, "No." Such old yamen styles exist everywhere.

The above is only a part of the facts exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement. Some of the problems have been solved, and some of the problems are being solved. But there are many similar serious phenomena that have not been exposed. Many leading cadres of the courts have an unclear understanding of the nature of the law, blindly worship and reuse former judicial personnel who have not been thoroughly transformed, allow the spread of old legal viewpoints, and even ask former judicial personnel to "take apprentices," ideologically becoming prisoners of old legal viewpoints. These organizational and ideological impurities must be thoroughly overcome in the judicial reform movement.

    坚决克服部分司法机关中的严重不纯现象
    全国将展开司法改革运动
    【本报讯】目前全国各地正酝酿进行司法改革工作。华东已在省、市以上人民法院中先后着手改革，并取得了初步经验；福建省、市人民法院等的整顿和改造，且已有了初步的成绩。其他各大行政区也已展开或准备展开这个改革工作。同时，中央政法机关的共产党组织正以反对旧法观点为整党的主要内容，有重点地检查思想，并取得党内外的配合，展开党内的批评与自我批评，揭露与批判旧法观点，进一步推动这个改革运动。
    两年多以来，各级人民司法机关在土地改革、镇压反革命、“三反”、“五反”等群众运动以及在处理人民内部纠纷的各项工作中，有效地保护了人民的利益，沉重地打击了敌人，从而巩固了人民民主专政。人民司法机关的工作有一定的成绩，并有许多创造。但是，伟大的“三反”运动也暴露了不少的人民司法机关在政治上、组织上的严重不纯现象以及部分司法工作人员坏的思想和作风。有些人民司法机关因为被少数坏分子和具有浓厚旧法观点的人员所操纵和腐蚀，直接造成了宽纵敌人、败坏法纪、危害国家人民利益的恶果。
    在“三反”运动中揭露出来的普遍而突出的问题，是部分司法工作人员，特别是留用人员和混入的旧司法人员中坏分子的贪赃枉法和违法乱纪。在华东、东北、西北、西南已进行“三反”斗争的法院所发现的贪污分子中，旧司法人员都占最多数。他们不但贪污受贿，并且包庇反革命分子，包庇不法资产阶级分子，欺压群众，敲诈勒索，作出了严重的违法乱纪行为。最高人民法院去冬检举出该院书记员史靖侯和帮助审判工作的顾裕尚（均系旧司法人员）贪赃枉法的事实，就是一个例子。他们一面在人民法院工作，一面在外面进行黑律师活动。史靖侯在北京、天津设立所谓“联络站”，有组织地进行索贿徇私的活动。顾裕尚在处理公营北京机器厂和私商文同祥铁工厂欠款纠纷一案中，偏袒违法私商，约定以减少偿还款项的半数作为贪污的交换条件。顾裕尚在法院评议会上作了有利于文同祥铁工厂的辩护，致法院作了错误的判决，使国家财产受到严重损失。
    有些人民司法机关中，也混入了一些长期为反动派服务而作恶多端的坏分子，甚至有一贯与人民为敌的反革命分子。沈阳市人民法院六个审判员中即有五个是留用的旧司法人员，有的还是为北洋军阀、国民党、日伪及国民党服务过的“四朝元老”。云南省人民法院有三个副庭长都是反共反人民的罪魁。一个是蒋匪帮济南“特刑庭首席检察官”；一个是蒋匪帮“豫东挺进军兼许昌警备司令部军法官”；一个是国民党中统特务（均已被扣押）。这样一批人物混进人民司法机关内，就使得人民群众对人民司法机关大为不满。有些地区的人民群众曾尖锐地讽刺他们是“四帮五不”：一帮反革命分子危害人民；二帮封建地主压迫农民；三帮不法资产阶级分子破坏国家建设和压迫工人；四帮各种违法分子开脱罪责。他们对劳动人民的控诉，则是不受理、不传案、不讯问、不判决、不执行。
    反动的旧法观点对人民司法机关的侵蚀更为普遍。具有旧法观点的司法工作人员，在处理案件中敌我不分，认敌为友。他们歪曲搬弄所谓“时效已过”、“犯罪未遂”或“年轻”、“年老”等谰词，来开脱或减轻反革命分子的罪责。南京市人民法院一个旧法观点极深的审判员在处理一个恶霸地主在解放前杀死农民的案件时说：“已失时效，不予处理。”福建省和县的一个具有旧法观点的司法人员，处理一个农民在解放前杀死恶霸特务的案件时，却认为这个农民有“血债”而予处刑。具有浓厚的旧法观点的人，在处理公私关系和劳资纠纷的案件中，一般地都包庇和帮助了不法资产阶级分子。湖南衡阳铁路管理局工务段修建水管工程十二座，共二百零一节，由私商基业、协和两营造厂承包，约定三个星期交工。结果不仅误工三个星期，妨害通车，且由于营造商的严重偷工减料，通车后水管破裂五十四节，致使国家受到严重损失。但衡阳市人民法院审判员周重刚（旧司法人员）偏袒该两家营造厂，竟判决工务段应负三分之二的责任，私商只负三分之一的责任。当这一案件上诉到湖南省人民法院时，另一个旧司法人员虽然改判营造厂应负全部责任，但却藉口“商人的政治觉悟不高，完全是为私利打算，非有意识的造成损失”，公开为不法资本家盗窃国家资财的罪行作辩护，而免除其破坏国家经济建设的刑事罪责。至于处理婚姻案件，具有旧法观点的司法工作人员，一般地都对青年男女争取婚姻自由的正义斗争不予支持，对迫害妇女的犯罪分子则予宽容。安徽省六安县雇工高先才和地主卫光兴的“养女”恋爱，被地主在夜间“捉奸”杀死。可是审判人员孙潞（旧司法人员）却把二人的正当的自由恋爱行为，看作“逾墙相从”、“妨害家庭”罪（即妨害地主封建秩序），而为地主的杀人罪行辩解。
    具有旧法观点的司法工作人员在工作中严重地脱离群众，孤立办案，不调查研究，凭主观臆断而错乱判案。他们的工作作风是“推事主义”，常常不正确地毫无原则地强调“不告不理”、“无诉状不理”、“证据不足不理”、“当事人不适格不理”、“管辖地区不合不理”、“民事不管刑事”、“刑事不管民事”，强调“诉讼程序”，而拒绝解决应当关心的群众的实际问题，案件能推就推，能拖就拖，毫无政治责任心。至于对群众拍桌瞪眼，满口官腔的恶劣作风更为普遍。北京市有一个“打官司”的老百姓，本来还有很多话要说，就因为听不懂法官的“法言法语”：“你还有什么‘申诉’的吗？”
    （这位老百姓连问法官几次，也没有得到解释），便只得说“没有啦”。像这样的旧衙门作风到处都有。
    以上只是在“三反”运动中所暴露出来的事实的一部分，其中有些问题已经解决，有些问题正在解决。但类似的种种严重现象还有许多未被揭露。不少法院的领导干部对法律的本质认识不清，盲目地崇拜和重用未经彻底改造的旧司法人员，听任旧法观点的泛滥，甚至要旧司法人员“带徒弟”，思想上做了旧法观点的俘虏。这些组织上和思想上的不纯现象，都必须在司法改革运动中加以彻底克服。
