Failure to Inspect After Making Plans Prevents Implementation of Advanced Experience
Qiao Sheng

Since April of last year, the Suihua Engineering Section of the Suihua Railway Sub-bureau has been experimenting with the Soviet Nefedov track maintenance method in the Suinan track maintenance district. With the personal help and guidance of higher authorities and the concerted efforts of all staff and workers in the section, the Suinan track maintenance district has become a model district for promoting the Nefedov track maintenance method in railways nationwide. However, more than a year has passed, and only thirteen of the thirty-two track maintenance districts under the jurisdiction of the Suihua Engineering Section have implemented the Nefedov track maintenance method, and some places are still using a mixture of old and new methods.

Why hasn't the Suihua Engineering Section universally implemented the Nefedov track maintenance method? The main reason is that the leading cadres do not have sufficient understanding of the significance and role of promoting the Nefedov track maintenance method, and their determination is not strong enough. They only make plans every month without inspection, resulting in drift. Some cadres also see completing tasks as being in opposition to promoting the Nefedov track maintenance method; or they see promoting the Nefedov track maintenance method as being contradictory to completing production and financial plans. More seriously, when a demonstration was to be done in the Suinan track maintenance district, people were sent to help cultivate a typical example, but after the demonstration was completed and a summary was made, it was "all good," and no one cared anymore. For example, Comrade Yang Guiben (National Railway Labor Model), supervisor of the Suinan track maintenance district, studied four or five times inside and outside the pass, but the leading cadres failed to help him well summarize the experience he learned and apply it and give it play in his work. When he proposed to make new tools, the leading cadres did not help solve the problem in time.

Why do the leading cadres of the Suihua Engineering Section act like this? The reason is that they have not recognized that promoting advanced experience is a fierce struggle between advanced and backward thinking, and they have taken this matter very simply. According to Section Chief Sun Bingchen: In the process of promoting the Nefedov track maintenance method, ideological education for the workers was very insufficient, so it did not arouse the workers' attention. In addition, the leading cadres used rigid methods to force implementation, force cultivation, and force rehearsal, which made the workers unwilling to accept this experience. Some workers said: "What's the point of promoting this thing? We still have to have cadres watching us and constantly hold meetings to study..." Some track maintenance districts did not use pickaxes to hit sleepers when repairing tracks, and were criticized by cadres. The workers said: "In the future, send someone to watch them (referring to the leading cadres) two hundred meters away so they won't see us." Some cadres also don't criticize when they find shortcomings, fearing that "criticism will lose the prestige of the typical example." This in turn encourages subordinates to develop a sense of pride and complacency when they have made some achievements, and they do not work hard to study.

In addition, making good plans is one of the keys to promoting the Nefedov track maintenance method, but the leading cadres have not paid attention to educating the track maintenance foremen. Therefore, some track maintenance foremen with low levels of education emphasize that they cannot make plans because they are not cultured enough. Of course, this cannot be a reason. For example, Yang Tongju, the track maintenance foreman of Huaxing, is illiterate, but he recognizes that promoting the Nefedov track maintenance method is the most effective way for the engineering department to ensure the success of full load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement. Therefore, he studied hard. When he didn't know how to write, he used code to replace it, and he made the plan very well.

Another issue also shows that the Suihua Engineering Section's leading cadres' approach to promoting advanced experience is inappropriate: After the foreman completes the work plan for the day, he directly hands it over to the squad leaders for implementation. The squad leaders must be familiar with the work they lead in order to discover problems and provide timely guidance. However, in the Suinan track maintenance district of the Suihua Engineering Section, four squad leaders were changed in the twenty-plus days from May to early June. Because the new squad leaders were not familiar with the work and did not provide proper guidance, rework occurred, causing great damage to the promotion of the Nefedov track maintenance method. Of course, there was even less talk of creating favorable conditions for the promotion of the Nefedov track maintenance method.

    只订计划不做检查就不能贯彻先进经验
    乔生
    绥化铁路分局绥化工务段，从去年四月份起，在绥南养路工区试验推行苏联聂菲铎夫养路法。在上级亲自帮助指导和全段职工一致努力下，绥南养路工区已成为全国铁路推行聂菲铎夫养路法的典型工区。但是迄今已一年多了，绥化工务段管内三十二个工区，还只有十三个工区推行了聂菲铎夫养路法，某些地方在做法上还是半新半旧。
    绥化工务段为什么没有普遍推行聂菲铎夫养路法呢？主要原因是领导干部对推行聂菲铎夫养路法的意义和作用认识不足，决心不大。每月光订计划而不检查，形成自流。还有些干部把完成任务和推行聂菲铎夫养路法对立起来；或者把推行聂菲铎夫养路法和完成生产财务计划看成是互相矛盾的。更严重的是：要在绥南养路工区示范啦，就派人帮助培养典型，示范完了做出总结后就“万事大吉”，谁也不管。比如：绥南养路工区监工员杨桂本同志（全国铁路劳动模范），到关内关外学习四、五次，领导干部都没能很好帮助他总结学得的经验，在工作中加以运用和发挥，他提出要做新工具，领导干部也不即时帮助解决。
    绥化工务段的领导干部为什么要这样作呢？原因是他们没有认清推行先进经验乃是先进和落后思想的一场激烈的斗争，而把这件事情看的很简单。据段长孙秉琛说：在推行聂菲铎夫养路法当中，对工人的思想教育非常不够，所以没有引起工人的重视，加之领导干部又用生硬的方式硬贯彻、硬培养、硬排演，更使工人不愿接受这个经验。有的工人说：“推行这个玩艺作啥，还得叫干部看着，经常开会研究……。”有的工区修道不用洋镐打枕木，被干部批评，工人们说：“以后在二百公尺远派一个人看着他们（指领导干部），不让他们看见。”也有些干部发现缺点也不批评，怕“批评失掉典型威信”。这又促使下级有点成绩就产生骄傲自满情绪，不努力钻研。
    此外，做好计划是推行聂菲铎夫养路法的关键之一，但领导干部没有注意对养路工长进行教育，因此某些文化程度低的养路工长就强调文化不够不能作计划。当然，这是不能成为理由的，例如华兴养路工长杨铜居一个大字不识，但他认清了推行聂菲铎夫养路法是工务部门保证作好满载、超轴、五百公里运动最有效的办法，因而苦心研究，不会写时用暗号代用，也把计划订的很好。
    从另外一个问题也可以看出绥化工务段领导干部对推广先进经验的作法不当：工长把一天工作计划作完了后，直接交给各班班长来执行，各班班长就必须对自己所领导的工作熟悉，才能发现问题，及时指导，而绥化工务段的绥南养路工区从五月到六月初二十多天的过程中，就换了四个班长。新班长因为工作不熟，指导不当，造成了工作返工现象，使推行聂菲铎夫养路法工作受到很大损失，当然更谈不上为推行聂菲铎夫养路法创造有利的条件了。
