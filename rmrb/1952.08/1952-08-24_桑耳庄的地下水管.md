    The Underground Water Pipe in Sang'er Village
    Li Wen

    I
    This spring, the masses of Sang'er Village in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, built a five-li long underground water pipe, bringing the spring water from Huangya Ridge in the southwest of the village into the village, solving the problem of drinking water that had not been solved for hundreds of years.
    Sang'er Village is a mountain village at the eastern foot of the Taihang Mountains. The entire village, consisting of 339 households, is divided into seven sections, distributed in a small basin surrounded by mountains. It was very difficult for the villagers to get drinking water. In days with moderate rainfall, people had to carry water from a reservoir more than two li southwest of the village; in times of drought, they had to fetch water from halfway up Huangya Ridge, five li away (residents in the eastern part of the village had to walk eight li). The journey involved climbing a slope and then scaling a one-li long cliff. The spring water flow was very small, and people had to use small iron spoons to collect water. Often, tens or hundreds of people waited to draw water. Some people carried dry food and set out for the ridge before dawn, only to return home with water in the evening. Some also went up the mountain at night when there were fewer people, and sometimes their pack animals fell into ravines dozens of yards deep and died. Seventy or eighty years ago, an old man named Sang, who lived in the east street, went to Huangya Ridge on the eve of the Lunar New Year to carry back a load of water. His daughter-in-law met him at the village entrance, took the water buckets, and accidentally spilled both buckets of water after taking only a few steps. The daughter-in-law felt very sorry for the old man and, thinking that they would not have sweet water to drink on the first day of the New Year, she went home and hanged herself.
    Now, the spring water from Huangya Ridge obediently flows continuously into the village. The day it first flowed in, the village was as lively as during the land distribution, and even old men in their seventies went to welcome the water with canes. The old women simply held their children and sat beside the water source, watching for a long time. Some old men, seeing young people carrying water home, asked them to put down their loads and insisted on carrying a few loads of fresh water themselves, just to "enjoy the feeling!" People talked about how "things that they never dreamed of in the past have now been accomplished so quickly."

    II
    How did the spring water flow into the village?
    After the land reform, the lives of the masses in Sang'er Village improved. The villagers had dug dozens of dry water wells and deepened the reservoir, but they were still helpless during droughts, and people were still very distressed. Last spring, the Sang'er Village branch of the Chinese Communist Party led the masses in digging a fresh water well, digging more than eighty feet deep, through layers of hard rock. After months of effort, they finally failed. Individual village cadres and some of the masses were discouraged, but the Communist Party members, represented by Sang Dezhang, the village branch secretary, and Sang Yinde, a branch committee member, were determined. Sang Dezhang encouraged the Party members, saying, "Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the masses at all times. Now that the masses urgently need to solve the problem of drinking water, we should lead the masses to solve it. If we can't dig out fresh water underground, we must find a way to bring the fresh water from Huangya Ridge into the village!" The Party members were convinced, but many of the masses lacked confidence. The old men said:
    "For generations, many capable people have tried, but none could bring the spring water from the western mountain down. Do you think you have the ability to drill through the sky!" The Party members replied, "We couldn't solve it in the past because it was the old society; now that we have Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, there is no difficulty we cannot overcome!"
    Song Yushan, the district Party secretary, also came to the village for this matter. He led Sang Dezhang and others to Huangya Ridge to measure the water source. In the cold weather of December, they bared their arms to dig through the silt and used a water tube to test that the spring water flowed at fifty loads per hour, or one thousand two hundred loads per day and night. Each household used an average of two loads of water per day, and the whole village used only about seven hundred loads per day. As long as there was a way to ensure that the water did not leak along the way, the problem would be solved. This test strengthened Sang Dezhang's determination even more.
    They repeatedly inspected the terrain. From the water source to Sang'er Village, they had to pass through steep cliffs and uneven hills, and cross ditches and terraced fields. If they built an open canal, the water volume would be too small to reach the village, and it would easily be destroyed by mountain floods. Finally, they decided to build an underground water pipe. But no one knew how to install it. So they went to consult Sang Qingchang, of the village's sideline production team. He often did business in various cities and had some knowledge of underground water pipes. As a result of the consultation, some technical problems were solved.
    The preparation work for the water pipe took several months. The Party branch measured the water pipe route, designed a type of water pipe, prepared to make it themselves, and made a preliminary estimate of the project budget—about 28 jin of rice per person and four workdays for the whole village. Sang Dezhang, the Party branch secretary, gave a persuasive report at the village people's representative meeting, introduced the above situation, and formally suggested to the representatives to start construction. The masses were persuaded and were very enthusiastic. In the "fan shi" (a place where farmers gather with their rice bowls to eat and talk), and in families, people were talking about this issue. People said:
    "As long as we can get water to drink, we would be happy to contribute one hundred jin of rice, let alone twenty!" Immediately afterwards, the canal construction committee was formally established, and branch secretary Sang Dezhang was elected as the director of the canal construction committee.
    The entire waterway project required a large amount of lime, and 15,000 water pipes had to be fired. The village already had a lime kiln, and there was also labor. But the canal construction committee calculated that no lime would be needed in the initial stages, so they decided to produce lime for sale first, which could generate a profit of more than two million yuan per kiln. When firing water pipes, bricks and tiles could be fired at the same time, and farmers who needed bricks and tiles for building houses could be mobilized to pre-purchase them. In this way, each person in the village only needed to contribute 2,000 yuan for the water pipe project.
    On April 10, construction officially began, and the first batch of migrant workers, all young and strong, went to the construction site. From the water source to "Tuoyao" (Camel's Back), a section of more than 800 feet, was all cliffs and steep walls. It was not easy to even stand in such a place, let alone work! But this did not stop the brave migrant workers. They divided into groups, carefully studied the cracks and shapes of the rocks, and looked for the knack. What could be "split" with a pickaxe was split, and what could not be split was blasted with explosives. In six days, a road five feet wide and more than 800 feet long, crossing the cliff, was built. This opened up the way forward for the entire project.
    The specifications of the underground waterway are as follows: two feet wide, with rocks piled up on both sides, generally two feet deep, and in a few areas, it had to be dug more than ten feet deep into the ground. After the waterway was built, the bottom of the waterway was first paved with gravel, then covered with two inches of red soil mixed with lime, then the water pipes were installed, and then a layer of red soil mixed with lime more than two inches thick was covered on top of the water pipes to protect them.
    When installing the water pipes, active members Sang Longbao and Sang Jishuang carefully studied the installation method. The results of the trial installation showed that there were no leaks, even better than the old tiler Sang Yude's installation. They became technicians for installing water pipes and led the work of two technical groups. Later, more than a dozen migrant workers who could install water pipes were trained and assigned to six sections. The key link in the construction of the underground waterway - the technical problem of installing water pipes - was successfully solved by relying on the wisdom of the masses.
    The canal construction committee was very familiar with the psychology of the masses. Wherever the water pipe was built, they let the spring water flow there, which was convenient for using water and could boost morale. When people returned to the village from work every day, they would spread the good news in the village: "The water has climbed over 'Tuoyao'!"
    "The water has flowed to the Nanhuang Pond!" The encouragement of real victories is the greatest. Sang Jinzhong did not work hard in the first half of the day digging the waterway; but when he saw with his own eyes that the water flow had increased, his mood improved. In the second half of the day, he did more work than two people. The erosion of lime and the friction of the water pipes caused the technicians' hands to swell, and some of them bled, but they still worked as usual. On April 23, the spring water flowed over "Tuoyao." On the two-li long construction site from "Tuoyao" to Nanhuang Pond, more than 200 migrant workers came automatically, both men and women. It rained, but people continued to work in the rain. Agricultural labor model Cheng Baifu became a model for repairing waterways. He created a labor-saving method that allowed a project that originally required a day to be completed in one morning.

    III
    In early August, I arrived at Sang'er Village. Spring water flowed continuously from the water pipes into the village, converging into a clear canal in the center of Second Street. Women were washing clothes by the canal, chatting happily.
    Sang Dezhang, the village Party branch secretary, enthusiastically led us to visit the underground waterway. Coming out of the village, the fields presented a scene of a rich harvest. On top of the land covered by the underground waterway, corn more than a meter tall and lush green millet seedlings had grown. We crossed a road that was passable for large carts. Beside the road was a row of neat terraced fields made of stone. The terraced fields and the road differed in height by more than ten feet, and the autumn crops on the terraces swayed in the wind. If Sang Dezhang hadn't said so, no one would have thought that the underground waterway passed under here! Sang Dezhang pointed to the terraced fields and the road and said, "This place caused us a lot of trouble. In order to install the water pipe two feet deep under the road surface, while maintaining the proper slope of the waterway above and below, we split open the terraced fields and built the waterway fourteen or fifteen feet deep underground; then we rebuilt the terraced fields as they were." After climbing several such terraced fields and crossing several small earthen hills, we came to a dry ditch more than ten feet wide. Sang Dezhang said, "Don't think this ditch has no water now. When it rains heavily, the mountain water rushes down like a hurricane, and can roll stones weighing hundreds of pounds." He pointed to the stone bridge under his feet and said, "This is a spillway bridge that we specially built. The waterway passes under this bridge, allowing mountain water to flow over the bridge." Climbing a mountain like a camel's back, we came to the middle of Huangya Ridge. In the middle of the cliffs, which are dozens of yards high, there is a five-foot-wide sidewalk. Here, the stone trough of the underground waterway is slightly exposed above the ground, and it is installed on the side close to the mountain root. Sang Dezhang said, "We have studied the location of the underground waterway. By placing the waterway close to the mountain root, the mountain water will not wash against it."
    We headed straight to the water source, which had been sealed with crushed stones and carefully protected. We put our ears close to the stone wall and quietly listened to the singing of the spring water. At this time, Sang Dezhang, who was steady and full of energy, told me, "We are preparing to build a reservoir that can hold thousands of loads of water to regulate the water volume, and construction will begin after the autumn harvest; we will also build the waterway to every street, install several faucets on each street, so that the whole village can drink tap water! Also, now that the water source has been dredged and the water volume has increased, we can have more water left over every day, and we can also build bathhouses, open flour mills, and carry water for planting during spring droughts..."
    Sang Dezhang smiled happily, a happy smile of a victor who has gone through arduous struggles.

    桑耳庄的地下水管
    力文
    一
    今年春天，平原省林县桑耳庄群众兴建了一条五里长的地下水管，把村西南黄崖岭上的泉水引到村里，解决了数百年来一直没法解决的吃水问题。
    桑耳庄是太行山东麓的一个山村。全村三百三十九户人家分成七片，分布在四面环山的一块小盆地里。村民们吃水十分困难。雨水调匀的日子，人们要到村西南二里多地的蓄水池挑水；天旱水干时，便要到五里以外的黄崖岭半山腰取水（村东头的居民要走八里）。中间要爬一段坡，再攀过一里长的峭崖。泉水流量很小，人们要拿着小铁勺去接水。常常是成十成百的人等着打水。有的人带着干粮，五更天动身上岭，到天黑才担着水回家。也有人趁黑夜人稀时上山取水，有时驮水的牲口滚下几十丈深的山沟跌死了。七、八十年前，住在东街的一个桑姓老汉，旧历除夕的晚上去黄崖岭挑回一担水，儿媳妇到村头接他，接过水担子走了几步，不留神把两筒水泼光了。媳妇越想越对不住老人家，又想起大年初一吃不上一顿甜水，回家便上吊死了。
    现在，黄崖岭上的泉水顺从地源源流进村里来了。第一次流来的那天，村里像分土地时一样热闹，连七十多岁的老汉也拄着拐杖去迎接水。老大娘们索性抱着孩子坐在水头的旁边，一看看半晌。有的老汉看见年轻人担着水回家，便让年轻人把担子放下，要亲自担几担活水，也“痛快痛快！”人们谈论着：“过去做梦也想不到的事，现在说办就办到了。”
    二
    泉水是怎样流进村里来的呢？
    土地改革后，桑耳庄群众的生活改善了。村民曾先后打了几十眼旱水井，掏深了蓄水池；但天一旱就没办法，人们仍旧很苦恼。中国共产党桑耳庄村支部去年春天曾领导群众打活水井，打了八丈多深，层层是干硬的石块。几个月的努力，最后失败了。个别村干部和部分群众很泄气，但以村支部书记桑德章、支部委员桑印德为代表的共产党员的决心很坚定。桑德章鼓励党员们说：“毛主席教育我们时时刻刻为群众服务。现在群众迫切要求解决吃水问题，咱们就应该领导群众来解决。地下挖不出活水，咱要设法把黄崖岭上的活水引到村里来！”党员思想通了，但许多群众没有信心。老汉们说：
    “辈辈相传，能人多哩，都不能叫西山泉水下山，难道你们有钻天的本事！”党员们回答说：“过去不能解决，因为那是旧社会；现在有了毛主席、共产党，就没有不能克服的困难！”
    区委书记宋玉山也为此事到村上来了。他率领桑德章等到黄崖岭上测量水源。腊月天气，他们赤着胳膊掏开淤沙，用水筒试出泉水每小时流五十担，
    一天一夜可流一千二百担。每户一天平均吃水两担，全村一天只用水七百担左右。只要有办法保证中途不跑水，问题就解决了。这一试验，使桑德章决心更大了。
    他们往返察看地形。从水源到桑耳庄，中间要经过峭陡的悬崖和高低不平的丘陵，要穿过水沟和一级一级的地岸。如果修明水渠，水量太小，流不到村，而且容易被山洪冲毁。最后他们决定修一条地下水管。可是谁也不知道该怎样安装。于是去请教本村副业生产组的桑庆昌。他常到各城市做生意，对地下水管有些见识。请教的结果，解决了一些技术问题。
    修水管的工作准备了几个月。党支部测量了水管路线，设计了一种水管，准备自己烧制，并初步制出工程的预算——大约全村每人要负担二十八斤米，出四个工。村支部书记桑德章在村人民代表会上作了一个有说服力的报告，介绍了以上的情况，正式向代表们建议兴建。群众被说服了，劲头很大。“饭市”（农民端着饭碗凑集在一起边吃饭边谈话的地方）上，家庭里，都在谈论这个问题。人们说：
    “只要吃到水，不要说出二十多斤米，出一百斤也痛快！”紧接着，修渠委员会正式成立了，支部书记桑德章被选为修渠委员会主任。
    整个水道工程要用大量石灰，要烧制一万五千个水管。石灰窑本村原来就有，劳动力也有。但修渠委员会计算到开始阶段不用石灰，便决定先生产石灰去卖，一窑可获利二百余万元。烧制水管时可附带烧砖瓦，发动因修建房屋需要砖瓦的农户来预购。这样，全村每个人在水管工程上实际只需拿出二千元就够了。
    四月十日正式动工，全部由青壮年组成的第一批民工队开上工地。从水源到“驼腰”八百余尺的一段，全是悬崖陡壁。不要说做工，空身在这种地方都不易站住脚啊！但这没有难住勇敢的民工队。他们分开小组，细心研究岩石的裂纹、石形，寻找窍门。该用铁镐“劈”的就劈，劈不动就用炸药炸。六天工夫，一条五尺宽、八百多尺长，横穿悬崖的大道筑成了。这给整个工程开辟了前进的道路。
    地下水道的规格是这样：两尺宽，两侧用岩石垒起，一般深二尺，少数地带要深入地面十多尺；修筑好水道后，首先用碎石铺平水道底层，再铺上二寸厚的红土石灰，然后安装水管，再在水管上面覆盖一层两寸多厚的红土拌石灰，保护水管。
    在安装水管的时候，积极分子桑龙宝、桑计霜仔细研究了安装的办法。试装的结果，一点不漏水，比老瓦匠桑玉德装的还要好。他们成为安装水管的技工，分别领导两个技术小组的工作。以后又陆续培养了十多名能安装水管的民工，分派到六个工段。修建地下水道的重要环节——安装水管的技术问题，就这样依靠群众的智慧顺利地解决了。
    修渠委员会十分熟悉群众心理。水管修到那里，便让泉水流到那里，用水方便，又能鼓舞人心。每天做工的人回村时，便把“水爬过‘驼腰’啦！”
    “水流到南荒池啦！”的喜讯传到村里。现实的胜利对人的鼓舞是最大的。桑金仲头半晌掘水道没卖力气；但当他亲眼瞧见水流大了时，情绪便高了。后半晌，他一个人干的活比两个人还多。石灰的浸蚀，水管的摩擦，使技工们的手都浮肿了，有的流血了，他们仍照样工作。四月二十三日，泉水流过“驼腰”了。从“驼腰”到南荒池二里长的工地上，自动来了二百多民工，有男的也有女的。天下雨了，人们淋着雨照样干。农业劳动模范成百福，又成了修水道的模范。他创造了省工作业法，使本来需要一天的一件工程用一个清早和上午就完成了。
    三
    八月初，我到了桑耳庄。泉水从水管里源源不绝地流进村来，在二街的中心汇成一个澄清的小渠。妇女们在渠旁洗衣，快活地谈笑着。
    村支部书记桑德章热情地领着我们参观地下水道。走出村来，田野里呈现着一幅丰收的景色。覆盖着地下水道的土地上面，已长出一人多高的玉蜀黍和绿黝黝的茂盛的谷苗。我们跨过一条通行大车的大道，道旁是一列用石块砌成的整齐的地岸，地岸和大道高低相差十多尺，岸上的秋庄稼迎风摆动着。如果桑德章不说，谁也想不到地下水道就是从这下面穿过的！桑德章指着地岸和大道说：“这个地方给我们增加了不少麻烦。为了在大道地面下二尺深处安装水管，而又保持水道上下的适当坡度，我们劈开这个地岸，在地面下十四五尺深处修筑水道；然后再照原样把地岸筑起来。”爬上几道这样的地岸，越过几个小土岭，是一个一丈多宽的干水沟，桑德章说：“您不要看这个沟现在没水，下大雨的时候，山水像狂风似地冲下来，能把几百斤重的石块冲得骨碌碌地滚。”他指点着脚下的石桥说：“这是我们特意修筑的漫水桥。水道从这个桥下穿过，让山水从桥上流过。”登上一个骆驼腰似的山头，便走到黄崖岭的半山腰了。在数十丈高的悬崖中间，筑有一条五尺宽的人行道。这里，地下水道的石槽稍露出地面，它被安设在靠近山根的一边。桑德章说：“地下水道的位置，我们曾作过一番研究。让水道靠山根，山水下来冲不着。”
    我们一直奔向水源，水源已用碎石块封住，严密地保护起来了。耳朵贴近石壁，我们静静地听着泉水的歌唱。这时，举止稳重而充满活力的桑德章告诉我：“我们正在准备修一个容纳数千担水的水库，来调剂水量，秋收后就要动工；还要把水道修到每一条街，每条街安上几个水龙头，让全村都吃自来水！还有，现在水源疏通了，水量大了，每天可剩余更多的水了，我们还可以建澡塘、开粉房，春旱的时候还可以挑水点种……”
    桑德章幸福地笑着，这是经历了艰苦斗争的战胜者的幸福的笑。
