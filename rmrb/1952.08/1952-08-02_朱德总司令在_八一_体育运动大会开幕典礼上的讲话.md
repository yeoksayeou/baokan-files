Today is the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. For the past twenty-five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, relying on their own army as the main tool, have overthrown the rule of powerful imperialism and domestic counter-revolutionary forces, established the People's Republic of China, and begun to enter a great period of construction. After the victory of the people's revolution, the new historical task of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is to continue to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship together with the people of the whole country, consolidate national defense, safeguard the fruits of the people's revolution, safeguard the construction of the motherland, and safeguard peace in the East and the world.

The great movement of the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea, and the heroic struggle of the Korean military and civilians, have severely thwarted the US imperialist plan to invade Korea and China. However, the warmongers of the United States have not learned their lesson from defeat, and are still continuing to occupy our territory of Taiwan, constantly violating our country's airspace, and carrying out barbaric germ warfare, bombing, and strafing against peaceful residents. They are also doing their utmost to obstruct and delay the armistice negotiations, attempting to maintain international tensions, accelerate the expansion of armaments, and prepare for a new world war of aggression. Therefore, the security of the motherland and international peace are still under threat. We must be sufficiently vigilant and fully prepared.

In order to stop the imperialist conspiracy of aggressive war, to defend the great construction cause of the motherland, and to defend peace in the East and the world, the Chinese People's Liberation Army must accelerate its regularization and modernization. Over the past three years, with the development of the construction cause of the motherland, the People's Liberation Army has established brand-new air force, navy, armored forces, artillery, and various special forces on the basis of a strong army. However, the great project of modernization is only just beginning, and we must continue to work hard without slackening.

In order to accelerate the construction of the troops, all commanders and fighters with low cultural levels must step up their study of cultural knowledge, and strive to master this necessary prerequisite for improving military level, political theory level, and working ability. At present, a wave of cultural learning has been created in the troops, and new creations are constantly emerging. Leading organs at all levels must conduct in-depth inspections and guidance, and the vast number of teachers should be actively responsible, and work together to improve the cultural level of the troops.

In order to accelerate the construction of the troops and improve military technology, it is also necessary to universally develop military sports activities to cultivate strong physical fitness, promote sports activities suitable for military needs, and serve combat and national defense construction. Emphasis must be placed on popularization, giving play to collectivism, promoting the spirit of unity and progress, promoting revolutionary competition, and opposing championism.

Over the past twenty-five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has gained rich experience in army building and combat. In the future, the People's Liberation Army will, on the basis of its existing rich experience, unswervingly further develop towards complete regularization and modernization, and shoulder the glorious task of defending the motherland and defending peace.

Today, on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the army, we are holding the All-Army Sports Meet. Our task is to review the achievements of the troops in cultural education, sports, military technology, and literary and artistic activities, promote advantages, exchange experiences, in order to effectively promote the training of the troops. Therefore, the conference is very meaningful to us. I wish the conference a complete success. And I hope that after the conference, the sports and cultural activities of the entire army will be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, following the correct direction.

    朱德总司令在“八一”体育运动大会开幕典礼上的讲话
    今天是中国人民解放军建军的二十五周年纪念日。二十五年以来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，依靠着人民自己的军队作为主要工具，推翻了强大的帝国主义和国内反革命势力的统治，建立了中华人民共和国，并且开始进入了伟大的建设时期。中国人民解放军在人民革命胜利之后，新的历史任务，是要继续和全国人民一道，巩固人民民主专政，巩固国防，保卫人民革命胜利的成果，保卫祖国的建设，保卫东方与世界和平。
    中国人民伟大的抗美援朝运动和朝鲜军民的英勇奋战，使美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和中国的计划受到严重的挫折。但是美国的黩武主义者还没有接受失败的教训，还在继续强占着我国的领土台湾，还在不断地侵犯我国的领空，并向和平居民进行野蛮的细菌战和轰炸、扫射，还在极力阻挠和拖延停战谈判，企图保持国际紧张局势，加紧扩充军备，准备新的世界侵略战争。因此，祖国的安全与国际和平还继续受着威胁。我们必须有足够的警惕和充分的准备。
    为制止帝国主义的侵略战争阴谋，保卫伟大祖国的建设事业，保卫东方与世界的和平，中国人民解放军必须加速正规化、现代化的建设。三年以来，人民解放军随着祖国人民建设事业的发展，已经在强大的陆军的基础之上建立了崭新的空军、海军、装甲兵、炮兵和各个特种部队。但是现代化建设的伟大工程在目前还只是开始，我们必须毫不松懈地努力前进。
    为加速部队的建设，一切文化水平低的指挥员、战斗员，要加紧学习文化知识，努力掌握这一个提高军事水平、政治理论水平和工作能力的必须的前提条件。目前部队的文化学习已经造成热潮，新的创造不断出现。各级领导机关务须深入检查和指导，广大教员同志应当积极负责，一致为提高部队的文化水平而奋斗。
    为加速部队建设及提高军事技术，还需要普遍发展军事体育活动，以锻炼坚强的体力，提倡适合于军事需要的体育活动，为战斗和国防建设服务。并须着重普及，发挥集体主义，发扬团结进步的精神，提倡革命竞赛，反对锦标主义。
    中国人民解放军二十五年来，在中国共产党的领导之下，曾经获得了丰富的建军作战经验。今后，人民解放军必将在已有的丰富经验的基础之上，坚定不移地进一步向完全正规化、现代化发展，肩负起保卫祖国，保卫和平的光荣任务。
    今天，在建军二十五周年纪念节日，举行全军体育运动大会，我们的任务就是检阅部队关于文化教育、体育运动、军事技术和文艺活动的成绩，发扬优点，交流经验，以便有力地推进部队的训练。因此，大会对于我们是很有意义的。祝大会胜利成功。并望大会之后，全军的体育文化活动，循着正确的方针，有计划、有步骤地开展起来。
