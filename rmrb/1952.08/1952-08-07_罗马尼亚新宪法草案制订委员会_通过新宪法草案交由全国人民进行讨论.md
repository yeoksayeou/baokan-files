Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: The Romanian People's Republic New Constitution Draft Committee recently held a meeting. Committee Chairman Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej submitted the new constitution draft to the meeting for deliberation. After discussion, the committee unanimously passed the draft. The committee decided to submit the constitutional draft to the broad masses of the people for discussion. All Bucharest newspapers published the new constitution draft on the 18th.

The preface to the new constitution draft points out: The Romanian People's Republic is a state of urban and rural working people. The emergence of the Romanian People's Republic is due to the historic victory of the Soviet Union over German fascism and the liberation of Romania by the glorious Soviet army. The liberation of Romania enabled the working people, led by the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party, to overthrow the fascist dictatorship of Antonescu, eliminate the regime of the exploiting classes, and establish a people's democratic state that fully conforms to the interests and aspirations of the Romanian people. The constitutional draft points out: In this way, the long-term struggle of the Romanian working people for freedom and national independence finally achieved a historic victory.

The preface continues: The establishment and consolidation of the people's democratic state, the friendship and alliance with the great Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's selfless fraternal assistance and support guarantee the independence, national sovereignty, development, and prosperity of the Romanian People's Republic.

The constitutional draft stipulates that the foreign policy of the Romanian People's Republic is a policy of defending peace, friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and a policy of peace and friendship with all peace-loving nations.

The constitutional draft points out: The Constitution of the Romanian People's Republic fixes the achievements of the working people, led by the working class, in the cause of socialist construction in Romania. The policy of the people's democratic state aims to eliminate exploitation of man by man and carry out socialist construction.

In the chapter on "Social System," the constitutional draft stipulates: The foundation of the Romanian people's regime is the alliance of the working class and the working peasants led by the working class. The People's Assembly is the political foundation of the Romanian People's Republic. The national economy of the Romanian People's Republic consists of three socio-economic components: the socialist component, the small commodity economy component, and the private capitalist component, while the socialist component is the basis for the country's development towards socialism.

Article 7 of the constitutional draft states: All underground resources, factories, mines, forests, rivers, natural power resources, all transportation, banks, post offices, telegraphs, telephones, radio, newspapers, movies, theaters, state-owned farms, agricultural machinery stations, public utilities, and urban state-owned properties are all state property, that is, property of the whole people. Article 8 stipulates: The land of the Romanian People's Republic belongs to the tillers. The material wealth belonging to collective farms and cooperatives is their respective collective property. The government supports small and medium farmers and handicraftsmen, protects them from capitalist exploitation, and expands production and improves their welfare. The state implements a policy of restricting and excluding capitalist elements. Private property rights and inheritance rights are protected by law. Foreign trade is monopolized by the state.

Chapter Two, "State System," points out: The state system of the Romanian People's Republic is a people's democratic system representing the power of the working people. The constitutional draft stipulates: A Hungarian Autonomous Region shall be formed in areas inhabited by Hungarians, and the residents of each state shall elect autonomous administrative leading organs.

Chapter Three, "The Highest State Power Organ of the Romanian People's Republic," states: The highest state power organ of Romania is the National Assembly, which is the only legislative organ and is elected by the working people of the republic every four years. Each electoral district includes 40,000 voters, who elect one representative. The National Assembly meets twice a year.

Chapter Four points out that the highest executive organ of state power is the Council of Ministers and describes its functions and powers.

Chapter Five stipulates the election rules, establishment, and responsibilities of local state power organs and their obligation to report their work to the voters. The state power organs of states (including the Hungarian Autonomous State), counties, towns, and villages are People's Representative Assemblies. They are elected every two years. The executive organ of the People's Representative Assembly is the Executive Committee.

Chapter Six states: The judiciary of the Romanian People's Republic is realized through the Supreme Court of the Romanian People's Republic, state courts, and people's courts. The main tasks of the courts are to defend the people's democratic system and the fruits of the working people, guarantee the effectiveness of people's laws, and protect public property and citizens' rights. Judges are only responsible to the law. The Supreme Court supervises the activities of all judicial organs. The Prosecutor General has the highest supervisory power over compliance with the law.

Chapter Seven stipulates the rights and obligations of citizens of the Romanian People's Republic. This chapter stipulates: Romanian citizens enjoy the right to work, the right to rest, the right to education, and the right to material security in old age, sickness, or loss of working ability. The state is concerned with the development of science, literature, and art. All working people enjoy full and equal rights in all aspects of economic, political, and cultural life. All restrictions on citizens' direct or indirect rights, the establishment of direct or indirect privileges based on racial or ethnic characteristics, any chauvinism, racial and ethnic hatred, or the appearance of nationalist-chauvinist propaganda, etc., shall be punished by law. Women of the Romanian People's Republic enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of economic, political, state, and cultural life. The state protects marriage and the family and guarantees the interests of mothers and children. Freedom of belief, religious ceremonies, speech, publication, assembly, and demonstrations are protected by law. Schools are separated from the church. Citizens have the right to participate in social organizations: trade unions, cooperatives, women's, youth, and sports organizations, and progressive cultural, technical, and scientific associations.

The new constitution draft points out: The Romanian Workers' Party—in which the ranks of the working class and the most active and conscious citizens of its working class participate—is the vanguard of the working people in the struggle to consolidate and develop the people's democratic system and to carry out the construction of a socialist society. The Romanian Workers' Party is the leading force of the working people's organizations and state organs. All organizations of working people throughout the country are united around it. Citizens of Romania have the right to inviolability of person. Foreign citizens who are persecuted for defending the interests of the working people, engaging in scientific activities, participating in national liberation struggles, and defending peace are allowed to seek refuge in Romania by the Romanian People's Republic. The draft imposes the following obligations on citizens: to abide by the state's constitution and laws, to defend, consolidate, and develop public socialist property, to abide by labor discipline, and to actively promote the consolidation of the people's democratic system and promote the prosperity of the country's economy and culture.

The constitutional draft says: Citizens have the obligation to perform military service, which is a glorious duty of citizens. Defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every Romanian citizen. Any act of betraying the motherland, violating the oath, defecting to the enemy, endangering national defense, or engaging in espionage shall be regarded as the most serious crime against the people and the country and shall be subject to the most severe punishment under the law.

The constitutional draft continues: Elections to the National Assembly and the People's Representative Assemblies shall be conducted by universal, direct, equal, and secret ballot. All working people have the right to vote and to be elected, except those who are mentally ill or deprived of their right to vote in accordance with the law. All organizations of the working people, such as the Romanian Workers' Party organizations, trade unions, cooperatives, youth organizations, and other mass organizations, have the right to nominate candidates.

Chapter Nine discusses the procedures for amending the constitution.
