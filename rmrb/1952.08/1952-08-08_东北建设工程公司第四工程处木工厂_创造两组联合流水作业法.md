Carpentry Shop of the Fourth Engineering Section of the Northeast Construction Engineering Company
Creates Two Sets of Combined Assembly Line Methods

The carpentry groups of Kang Yancheng and Wang Yinqing of the Carpentry Shop of the Fourth Engineering Section of the Construction Engineering Company of the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department, adopted the Xie Wanfu carpentry assembly line method based on their specific circumstances, created and implemented two sets of combined assembly line operations, and achieved results.

In June, when the Kang Yancheng and Wang Yinqing groups were making doors and windows, they adopted the Xie Wanfu assembly line method, but because the labor organization was not reasonable enough, individual processes were not assigned to fixed personnel, and the product quality and quantity still did not meet the standard quotas, and there were still instances of idle work and material stockpiling. For example, the two processes of marking and leveling were entirely the responsibility of one person, who was too busy to handle them. Another example was that the punching process was the responsibility of one worker, which could not supply the entire group; if it were changed to two people, half a work unit would be left over. At the same time, at that time, all the workers in the carpentry shop were making doors and windows, and there were many people and many cases in the yard, and there was no place to put the cases of their two groups. In order to solve these problems, they researched and came up with a two-group combined assembly line method. At the beginning, they combined the two groups of workers in the marking and punching processes to work together, and as a result, they saved one worker and gave full play to the efficiency of new tools such as marking machines. After further research by everyone, they believed that this combined mutual assistance method was very good and could be applied to most processes. Therefore, it was decided to re-allocate the manpower of the two groups appropriately according to the technical level, each responsible for their own duties, cooperate with each other, and establish mutual assistance groups in the same process. For example, the punching work of the two groups was the responsibility of two technicians and one apprentice, the leveling was the responsibility of two people, and the marking was the responsibility of one person, etc.

After the implementation of the combined assembly line method, a total of eight technicians were saved, the output increased from one three-piece door and window per person per day to two, and the quality increased from second-class grade two to first-class grade three. At the same time, it also played a great role in everyone's unity, mutual assistance, mutual supervision, and the implementation of the responsibility system.

Now, the Cui Bei carpentry group of the engineering department's carpentry shop has also begun to learn this new operation method, and implemented a combined assembly line operation with the Yang Ziyu group, and created a new record of two groups making a total of sixty-two five-piece windows a day.

    东北建设工程公司第四工程处木工厂
    创造两组联合流水作业法
    东北人民政府工业部建设工程公司第四工程处木工厂康延成、王印清两木工小组，根据他们的具体情况采用谢万福木工流水作业法，创造和实行了两组联合流水作业，并取得成绩。
    六月份，康延成、王印清小组做门窗时，采用谢万福流水作业法，但因为劳动力组织还不够合理，个别工序没有固定专人负责，产品质量数量仍达不到标准定额，且还有窝工、存料现象。如划线、平料两道工序全由一人负责，忙不过来。又如打眼工序由一个工人负责，也供不上全组使用；如改由两个人负责，又剩余半个工。同时，那时木工厂内的全部工人都在做门窗，场子里人多案子多，他们两组的案子竟没有地方安置。为解决这些问题，他们研究出了两组联合流水作业法。开始，他们先把在划线、打眼两道工序上的两组工人合在一起做，结果各省了一个人工，又充分发挥了划线机等新工具的效能，经大家进一步研究，认为这种联合互助方法很好，在大部分工序上都可运用。于是，便决定把两个组的人力按技术高低重新加以适当配备，各负专责，互相合作，并在同一工序中成立互助小组。如两组的打眼工作由二个技工、一个徒工负专责，平料由二人负专责，划线由一人负专责等。
    实行联合流水作业法后，共节省了八个技工，产量由每人每天做一扇三块料的门窗提高到做二扇，质量由二等二级品提高到一等三级品。同时，对大家团结互助，互相督促，贯彻负责制方面，也起了很大作用。
    现在，该工程处木工厂崔辈木工小组，也开始学习这种新作业法，和杨子玉组实行联合流水作业，并创两组每天共做六十二个五块料的窗口的新纪录。    （李汀、张兴）
