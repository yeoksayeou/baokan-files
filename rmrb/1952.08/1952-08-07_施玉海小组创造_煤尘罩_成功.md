    Shi Yuhai Group Successfully Creates "Coal Dust Cover"
    Comrade Editor: The Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine's safety production model worker Shi Yuhai group recently successfully created a "coal dust cover." This is another significant contribution they have made to safe production.
    In the past, when they drilled holes, coal dust (i.e., pulverized coal) or stone powder would fly all over the pit, which was very harmful. Workers who inhaled this air containing coal dust or stone powder would develop lung or stomach problems over time. More seriously, flying coal dust can easily cause explosions and combustion accidents.
    When discussing their production increase and savings plan, the Shi Yuhai group paid special attention to finding new methods for safe production. They believed: "Without safety, the goals of increasing production and saving resources cannot be achieved." The group's technician, Li Hongwen, and workers Liu Hansheng and Song Peiliang, with the help and encouragement of Shi Yuhai, also began to study how to avoid the hazards of coal dust or stone powder. Before "July 1st," they finally created a "coal dust cover." The "coal dust cover" is made of iron sheet and is shaped like a teacup with a spring at the bottom. As long as its opening is facing the coal wall and it is worn on the drill bit of the rock drill, the coal dust and rock powder that fly out during drilling can be caught in the cover, instead of flying around. This cover is six centimeters high diagonally, fifteen centimeters in diameter at the front opening, and four centimeters at the rear opening, with three holes of different diameters at the front, middle, and rear, through which the drill bit can pass. Tests have proven that the "coal dust cover" can be used not only for coal mining but also for tunneling. The cost of manufacturing one is only 5,000 yuan.

### 施玉海小组创造“煤尘罩”成功

    施玉海小组创造“煤尘罩”成功
    编辑同志：东北西安煤矿安全生产模范施玉海小组最近创造“煤尘罩”成功。这是他们在安全生产上的又一重大贡献。
    从前他们打眼时，煤尘（即粉煤）或石粉满坑飞扬，它的危害性很大。工人吸进这种带有煤尘或石粉的空气后，日子久了，就会得肺病或肠胃病。更严重的是煤尘飞扬很容易引起爆炸和燃烧事故。
    施玉海小组在讨论增产节约计划的时候，特别注意寻找安全生产的新办法。他们认为：“不安全就不能达到增产节约的目的”。组里的技术员李洪文和工人刘汉生、宋配良等，经过施玉海的帮助和鼓励，也开始研究怎样避免煤尘或石粉的危害。在“七一”前夕，终于创造出一种“煤尘罩”。“煤尘罩”是用铁片做成的，形状像茶碗，底上有弹簧。只要把它口向煤壁穿在凿岩机的钎子上头，打眼时飞出的煤尘岩粉就都可以落在罩里，而不再四处飞扬。这个罩子斜高六公分，前口直径十五公分，后口四公分，前、中、后，有三个直径不同的孔，钎子头可以从中穿过。试验证明，“煤尘罩”不仅在采煤时可以用，掘进时也可以用。制造一个成本只须五千元就够了。   徐佳辰
