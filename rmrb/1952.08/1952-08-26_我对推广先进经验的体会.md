My Experiences in Promoting Advanced Experiences
Huang Zhaoxiang, Deputy Manager of the First Factory of Fujian Machinery Plant

Over the past year, the First Factory of Fujian Machinery Plant has done some work and achieved some results in learning from advanced experiences. The foundry workshop has initially succeeded in trial-producing ductile iron under extremely rudimentary equipment conditions; 90% of the engine lathes in the machining workshop have adopted high-speed cutting methods, increasing efficiency by two to three times. From the process of promoting these advanced experiences, we have the following understanding:

In order to smoothly promote advanced experiences, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education and propaganda work of workers; otherwise, conservative ideas cannot be broken. For example, when testing ductile iron, the first attempt failed, and the workers' morale dropped. The leadership found news of successful trials from other factories and mines in the newspapers and read it to the workers to encourage them to continue the experiment. After the workers gained confidence, they took the initiative to experiment again and finally succeeded on the third attempt. Reading the newspaper played a significant role in promoting advanced experiences in our factory. The reports on promoting advanced experiences published in the People's Daily, Workers' Daily, and Liberation Daily have become good materials for us to educate and encourage workers. For example, when testing high-speed cutting methods, some older workers had very serious conservative ideas. They said that since their apprenticeship, they had been turning cast iron at slow speeds; now, if they turn at high speeds and the machine breaks, who will be responsible? The young workers were afraid to try after hearing this. Under these circumstances, the leadership seized specific examples to criticize conservative ideas; at the same time, they selected a typical worker and helped him to conduct experiments. Workers believe in practical results the most. After the typical experiment was successful, using this material to educate the workers achieved good results.

How can we do this work well? It is necessary for the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League to cooperate closely, act in unison, divide the work specifically, and earnestly carry out propaganda and mobilization work on the basis of patriotic ideological education.

    我对推广先进经验的体会
    福建机器厂第一厂副经理　黄兆祥
    福建机器厂第一厂一年来在学习先进经验方面曾经做了一些工作，也取得了一些成绩。翻砂场在设备极端简陋的情况下，试制球墨铸铁已经初步成功；加工车间百分之九十的马达车床都采用了高速切削法，效率提高一倍至三倍。从推广这些先进经验的过程中，我们有这样一点体会：
    为了顺利地推广先进经验，必须加强工人的思想教育和宣传鼓动工作，不然，保守思想就无法打破。比如在试验球墨铸铁时，第一次失败了，工人的情绪就低了下来。领导方面从报纸上找到其他厂矿试验成功的消息读给工人听，鼓励他们继续试验。工人们有了信心后就主动地再作试验，终于在第三次试验成功了。读报工作对我厂推广先进经验曾经起了很大作用。人民日报、工人日报和解放日报上登载的推广先进经验的报道，成了我们教育鼓动工人的很好的材料。又如，在试验高速切削法时，有些老年工人保守思想很严重。他们说，从学徒时起，车生铁就是打慢车；现在打快车，要是机器坏了谁负责。青年工人们听了这话也就不敢试了。在这种情况下，领导方面一面抓住具体例子，批判保守思想；一面选择一个典型，帮他进行试验，工人是最相信实际的，典型试验成功了，用这个材料教育工人就收到了很好的效果。
    怎样才能做好这些工作呢？必须要做到党、行政、工会、青年团密切配合、步调一致、具体分工，在爱国主义思想教育的基础上，认真做好宣传鼓动工作。
