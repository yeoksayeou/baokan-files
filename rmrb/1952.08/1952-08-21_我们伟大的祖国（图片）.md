    Our Great Motherland
    The predecessor of the China Medical University in Shenyang was the Health School of the Military Commission of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, founded in 1931. The school adopted a teaching method that combined theory with practice and a specialized focus system, which enabled it to train specialized personnel capable of handling various medical tasks in a short period of time. This is a scene of teachers in the neurology group of the Department of Anatomy of the Second Basic Hospital of China Medical University explaining to students using a model of the brain's nerves.
