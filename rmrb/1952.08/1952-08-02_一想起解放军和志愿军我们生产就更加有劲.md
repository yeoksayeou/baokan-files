    Thinking of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army Makes Us Produce Even More Vigorously

    Dear comrades of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army: August 1st is the Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. On this day, I naturally think of my past, present, and future.

    In the old society, I was a farmer who suffered oppression and humiliation. To pay rent to the landlord, my father was once forced to sell my younger sister (which he ultimately didn't do), and I also worked as a coolie in Qingdao and Dalian. The evil Japanese devils beat me half to death, almost taking my life. It was not until liberation that my whole family ended this painful history.

    After liberation, I was given land and housing, and I no longer have to worry about food and clothing. In 1946, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In June of this year, when the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government announced the second batch of model agricultural bumper harvest award recipients for 1951, my group was recognized as one of the comprehensive bumper harvest model mutual aid teams, and the whole group received a patriotic bumper harvest certificate and a bonus of three million yuan. I personally also received a patriotic bumper harvest medal, attended the Shandong Provincial Labor Model Representative Conference, and was elected as a standing committee member of the Kunyu County People's Representative Conference. Comrades, I often think that our happy life was created by you and is being protected by you.

    Thinking of you, I am filled with energy. This spring, my group participated in the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement of mutual aid teams in East China. Most of the plans we made have now been overfulfilled. For example, the original plan was to apply twelve carts of fertilizer per mu, but we have now applied thirteen carts; the plan to hoe the corn eight times has also been completed, and we are preparing to hoe it two more times. Our group cultivated eleven mu of land for a military family, prioritizing the military family before ourselves. Currently, their corn has been hoeed eight times, and the soybeans, peanuts, and sweet potatoes have all been hoeed three times.

    Comrades, we farmers have nothing else but strength. We guarantee to produce more grain to support you. You can have whatever you need, whenever you need it, so that you can eat well, dress warmly, and protect our motherland and world peace.

    一想起解放军和志愿军我们生产就更加有劲
    亲爱的中国人民解放军、志愿军全体指战员同志们：八月一日是中国人民解放军建军节。一到这天，我就很自然地想到了我的过去、现在和将来。
    在旧社会里，我是一个饱受压迫和侮辱的农民。为了给地主交租，父亲曾被迫要卖去我的妹妹（后来没有卖成），我也到青岛和大连当过苦力。万恶的日本鬼子把我打得死去活来，几乎断送了我的性命。直到解放，我全家才结束了这部辛酸的历史。
    解放了，我分得了土地，又分得了房，吃穿都不用发愁了。一九四六年我又光荣地参加了中国共产党。今年六月中央农业部公布一九五一年度农业丰产模范第二批受奖名单时，我组被评为全面丰产模范互助组之一，全组获得爱国丰产奖状一份、奖金三百万元。我个人也得到了爱国丰产奖章一枚，并出席过山东省劳动模范代表会议，还被推选为昆嵛县各界人民代表会议常务委员。同志们，我时常想到，我们的幸福生活是你们创造的，又是你们在保卫着的。
    一想起你们，我混身都是劲。今年春天我组参加了华东区互助组爱国丰产竞赛运动。我们订的计划，现在大部都超额完成了。比如，原计划每亩施肥十二车，现已施肥十三车；玉米锄八遍的计划也完成了，准备再锄二遍。俺组给一户军属代耕了十一亩地，作到了先军属、后自己。目前，他的玉米已锄了八遍，豆子、花生和地瓜都锄过三遍了。
    同志们，我们农民没有别的，就是有力气。我们保证多打粮食，支援你们。你们要什么有什么，什么时候要什么时候到，使你们吃得饱，穿得暖，好好地保卫咱们祖国，保卫世界和平。
    山东省昆嵛县河南村全面丰产模范互助组组长
