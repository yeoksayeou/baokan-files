    Suggest Organizing Photo Displays of Agricultural Collectivization and Mechanization in Rural Areas

    Editor: My home is in Renjiazhuang, Anping County, Hebei Province. Some time ago, I sent back four photos I took of agricultural machinery in operation during a school visit to a farm. The family wrote back saying they liked these photos very much. After taking them to the village government, the villagers looked at them with a magnifying glass and were very satisfied. They also urgently need to see more photos about mechanized farming and harvesting.

    Now the village is about to establish an agricultural production cooperative, and everyone wants to know about agricultural collectivization and mechanization. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant authorities organize a large number of photo displays of agricultural collectivization and mechanization in rural areas, to further educate farmers about the superiority of agricultural collectivization, so that they can quickly organize themselves.

    建议组织农业集体化和机械化的图片下乡
    编辑同志：我家在河北省安平县任家庄。前些日子我把学校参观农场时拍摄的农业机械操作照片四张寄了回去，家里回信说，他们非常喜欢这些照片，把它拿到村政府后，老乡们用放大镜看了一遍，大伙都很满意，而且迫切地需要多看到一些关于机械耕种和收割的照片。
    现在村里就要成立农业生产合作社了，大伙都想知道农业集体化和机械化的问题。因此我建议有关机关大量组织关于农业集体化和机械化的图片下乡，教育农民更进一步地了解农业集体化的优越性，使他们很快地组织起来。　　　　李　维
