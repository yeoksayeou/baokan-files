    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 10th, TASS: On the seventh anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, "Izvestia" commentator V. Florinsky wrote: Many Japanese newspapers are angrily denouncing this imperialist policy of atomic blackmail and threats. He then pointed out: U.S. officials say that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki accelerated the end of World War II, but this claim has long been refuted. Florinsky said: Everyone knows that the Soviet Union's participation in the war against imperialist Japan had already predetermined the defeat of imperialist Japan, so there was no need for atomic bombings. The American newspapers admitted this at the time.
    The commentator said: Now, the American imperialists still want to use atomic bombs to intimidate the people of all countries. However, the Japanese people have drawn appropriate conclusions from the large-scale, senseless massacre of the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Japanese people, like the people of all other countries in the world, are fully determined to carry the struggle for the prohibition of barbaric weapons of mass destruction through to the end.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 9th, TASS: Residents of Nagasaki commemorated the seventh anniversary of the destruction of the city's citizens by the American atomic bomb. They held a memorial service on the 9th to mourn those who were victims of the atomic bomb.
    The Association for the Protection of Children will also hold a conference on August 15th to commemorate the victims of the atomic bomb.

    苏联“消息报”斥美国的原子吓诈政策
    长崎人民追悼原子弹的牺牲者
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：在广岛遭受原子弹轰炸七周年之际，“消息报”评论员佛隆斯基著文说：日本报纸许多言论都愤怒地指责这种帝国主义的原子吓诈与威胁政策。他接着指出：美国官员说，对广岛与长崎的原子弹轰炸加速了第二次世界大战的结束，但这种说法早已被驳倒了。佛隆斯基说：大家都知道，苏联的参加反对帝国主义日本的战争已预先决定了帝国主义日本的失败，因此本来不需要进行原子弹轰炸。美国报纸当时也承认了这一点。
    评论员说：现在，美帝国主义者还想用原子弹来吓倒各国人民。但是，日本人民已从大规模无谓屠杀广岛与长崎人民的事件中得出适当的结论。日本人民和全世界其他国家人民一样，有充分决心把争取禁止大规模屠杀的野蛮武器的斗争进行到底。
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社东京九日讯：长崎居民纪念该市市民为美国原子弹毁灭的七周年。他们在九日举行了纪念会，追悼那些原子弹的牺牲者。
    保护儿童协会也将于八月十五日举行大会纪念原子弹的牺牲者。
