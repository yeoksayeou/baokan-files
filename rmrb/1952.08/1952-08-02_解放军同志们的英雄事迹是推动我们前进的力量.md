    The Heroic Deeds of the People's Liberation Army Comrades are the Power Driving Us Forward
    Dear Comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: As we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the great "August 1st" Army Day, we extend to you our lofty and sincere respect!
    Dear Comrades: We have you, and we feel infinite glory and pride. Your countless heroic deeds educate us, inspire us, and become the power for us to move forward. In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, we resolutely repelled the frantic attacks of lawless bourgeois elements and eliminated the filth and poison of corruption and waste left over from the old society. Now, our Beijing Normal University is showing a new atmosphere everywhere. The political consciousness of the students has greatly improved, and their love for the motherland, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao has deepened. Many students have joined the Communist Youth League and the Communist Party. We have strengthened our determination to fight for the educational cause of the motherland and the people. We are happily studying and exercising. Joyful songs are filling our campus.
    On this 25th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day, we once again assure you: We will use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, strive to master scientific knowledge, and improve our health, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. Dear comrades, we will always take your revolutionary heroic achievements as the power to encourage and drive us forward, and we will always learn from your noble qualities!
    All Students of Beijing Normal University

    解放军同志们的英雄事迹是推动我们前进的力量
    亲爱的中国人民解放军同志们：在庆贺伟大的“八一”建军节二十五周年的时候，我们向你们致以崇高而亲切的敬意！
    亲爱的同志们：我们有了你们，感到无限的光荣和骄傲。你们无数的英雄事迹教育着我们，鼓舞着我们，成为我们前进的力量。在“三反”、“五反”运动中，我们坚决地打退了资产阶级不法分子的猖狂进攻，清除了旧社会遗留下来的贪污、浪费等污毒。现在，我们北京师范大学到处都呈现着新气象。同学们的政治觉悟大大地提高了，对祖国，对共产党，对毛主席的热爱更加深了。许多同学加入了青年团，加入了共产党。我们坚定了为祖国人民教育事业而奋斗的决心。我们在愉快地学习着、锻炼着，在我们校园里，到处都洋溢着欢乐的歌声。
    在这“八一”建军节二十五周年的时候，我们再一次地向你们保证：决用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，并努力掌握科学知识，炼好身体，准备随时响应祖国的号召。亲爱的同志们，我们将永远以你们的革命英雄业迹作为鼓舞和推动我们前进的力量，永远学习你们的高尚品质！
    北京师范大学全体同学
