    Preliminary Experiences in Promoting Worker Cadres in Several State-Owned Factories in Shanghai
    After the "Three-Anti" Movement, several state-owned factories in Shanghai boldly promoted a large number of worker cadres, adjusted the composition of cadres, and made the relationship between staff and workers closer. This not only solved the current shortage of cadres in the industrial production sector, but also created conditions for further strengthening democratic management and carrying out production reforms in the future.
    The newly promoted cadres generally have a positive and responsible spirit, and have a style of close contact with the masses. For example, Niu Bingyuan of the Xin Xing Machine Factory has been a worker for eleven years, from apprentice to technician. Since liberation, he has consistently shown positive performance and enjoys high prestige among the masses. Since being promoted to deputy manager, he has further developed the work style of going deep into the masses and often goes to the workshop to help workers solve problems. Once, he found that the newly installed B-mold assembly machine in the factory often had accidents, so he mobilized the masses to find the root cause of the accidents and study solutions. As a result, such accidents were eliminated. Another example is Gu Zhenwu, a worker in the forging workshop of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Plant, who has correctly handled some problems since being promoted to deputy director of the production section. Once, regarding the quality of steel ingots, the steel rolling workers of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Plant raised many opinions to the steelmaking workers of the No. 1 Plant, and mutual estrangement occurred. Gu Zhenwu convened respected workers from the two plants to study, found the reason for the poor quality of steel ingots, and proposed improvement measures, eliminating the estrangement between the workers of the two plants. Yan Zhiqing, a worker in the cotton cleaning workshop of the State-owned Shanghai Sixth Cotton Textile Factory, still has a "handspike" in his hand since being promoted to deputy director of the workshop. When workers are busy, he helps everyone sweep the floor and mix cotton. Zheng Wenjie, a planer worker at the Wusong Machine Factory, was promoted to head of the material section. On the first day, he was entangled in some administrative work because all the workshops were calling him. He analyzed the content of the calls during the day and took reasonable measures to break free from the circle of administrative affairs. Then he mobilized the masses to sort out a large number of old materials piled up next to the factory's warehouse. After a month of effort, the warehouse was neatly organized, and the accumulated materials were fully utilized.
    The worker masses fully support the measure of promoting workers as cadres. They proposed to guarantee the completion of the production plan to support the work of the new cadres. Some workers were so happy that they couldn't sleep for several nights, saying, "I have been working for decades and have never seen a worker become a factory director." They truly realized that workers being masters is not empty talk, but a reality under the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, the broad masses of workers and staff are more trusting and supportive of the Party, and the Party's prestige among the masses has been greatly enhanced.
    The methods of promoting cadres in each factory are basically two: The first is the method of mass recommendation and leadership approval. Xin Xing Machine Factory, State-owned Shanghai First Cotton Textile Factory, and Third Cotton Textile Factory all did this. The specific methods are: 1. Conduct extensive publicity and education, announcing the positions, quotas, and standards and methods for selecting cadres; then conduct universal discussions from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, so that Party members and even non-Party masses clearly understand the significance of promoting worker cadres. 2. The leadership grasps a workshop or a unit to carry out this work, in order to absorb experience and guide the entire factory. 3. The specific steps are: first, the group recommends promotion candidates, which are determined after evaluation, and then passed by the workshop branch; then, the list of recommended promotion candidates is announced to widely solicit opinions from the masses, and then, according to the opinions of the masses, the original list is revised or supplemented; finally, in accordance with the cadre management procedures, it is submitted to the higher-level leading organs for review and approval. This method can not only correctly select talents, but also enable cadres to more deeply realize that they must better serve the people to gain the support of the masses. However, departments that adopt this approach must have the following two conditions: 1. The masses have been mobilized relatively deeply; 2. The Party organization can play a core role. Otherwise, it cannot be done well.
    The second is the method of leadership nomination and mass approval. The specific methods are: first, the leadership directly appoints; second, the leadership puts forward a list and requires Party members and members of the Communist Youth League to carry out publicity among the masses to ensure that the masses raise their hands to approve. This approach often fails to win the support of the masses and even arouses opposition from the masses; at the same time, the new cadres themselves also have concerns, fearing that they will not get the support of the masses and will not do a good job.
    In summary, the work of promoting worker cadres this time has the following preliminary experiences:
    1. After several major political movements, a large number of activists have emerged in various factories. Under these circumstances, it is entirely correct to adopt the policy of boldly and massively promoting worker cadres. However, to implement this policy, the leadership must clearly recognize the important significance of promoting worker cadres to the country's economic construction, and conduct in-depth mobilization and education inside and outside the Party. On the one hand, it is necessary to eliminate the inferiority complex of some workers who dare not do leadership work because of "low culture" and "weak leadership ability," and at the same time, it is necessary to correct the incorrect attitude of some people who are passive and jealous because they cannot be promoted. Only in this way can the policy of boldly and massively promoting worker cadres be correctly implemented.
    2. The principle of both "virtue" and "talent" must be adhered to in order to select truly excellent worker cadres. Such cadres should have the following three conditions: (1) clear history, politically reliable, and firm stance; (2) upright style, selfless, and able to contact the masses;
    (3) Consistent positive performance in production and work, and a certain level of work ability and technical skills. Some factories have set too high requirements in the promotion of cadres, which has limited the promotion of some activists, which is not right.
    3. Fully mobilizing the masses and conscientiously cultivating activists is the basis for massively promoting worker cadres. Experience has shown that the more extensive and in-depth the mobilization of the masses, the more activists will emerge, and the better the conditions for selecting cadres will be. Because only by fully mobilizing the masses can talents be truly discovered, and those older workers who truly have technology, talent, and contact with the masses can be promoted without omission. The leadership should plan and educate the activists, model workers, labor models, and new record creators who have emerged in political movements and production movements, so that they can become promotion candidates, so that they can be continuously promoted to leadership positions.
    4. Paying attention to improving the work ability of new cadres is an important issue in the work of promoting cadres. Therefore, when new cadres accept new work tasks, the Party organization should help them understand the overall situation and work system, pay attention to solving their problems in work and thought at any time, and help them formulate work plans. The Shanghai Chemical Plant gave great inspiration to new cadres by holding symposiums to introduce ideological conditions and work methods to each other.
    In addition, pay attention to solving the difficulties of new cadres. If the new cadres have a low level of education, transfer comrades with high levels of education to be their assistants; all production problems should be studied together with the new cadres to give play to their work abilities. In addition, try to run various training classes to improve their political awareness, technical level and cultural level; at the same time, it is necessary to prevent new cadres from being arrogant and complacent and from being detached from the masses.
    5. In the work of promoting worker cadres, the following specific issues must be correctly resolved: (1) When promoting worker cadres, in addition to paying attention to massively promoting workers, attention should also be paid to promoting employees who perform better, have a clear history, have technology, and meet the conditions for cadres;
    (2) Pay attention to promoting older skilled workers and cultivating young workers;
    (3) Pay attention to maintaining a certain number of backbones and skilled workers in the workshop, and should not let too many people leave the producers and affect production; (4) The wages of new cadres should generally be paid according to the new position, and cadres with the same ability and technology who are promoted to Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League work should in principle be given the same treatment as skilled workers, and at least should not be lower than the original wage, so as not to affect their family life and their work mood.
    Pan Fusheng, Luo Yuchuan, etc., Secretaries of the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee
    Lead Cadres to Factories and Villages to Inspect Work
    In order to promote the province's patriotic production increase and economization campaign and consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement, and establish a new style of linking with the masses, the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee has organized a large number of cadres to factories and villages to inspect work. Pan Fusheng, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, led a group of cadres to the Jiaozuo Coal Mine to inspect the development of the patriotic production increase and economization movement. Luo Yuchuan, the second secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, and Liu Yanchun, Minister of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, led a group of cadres to counties along the Yellow River to inspect flood control work. Zhang Chengxian, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, will lead a group of cadres to the Heze and Huxi Special Zones to inspect the patriotic production increase and economization movement and mobilize the masses. Yang Jue, Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee, led a group of cadres to the Puyang and Liaocheng Special Zones to inspect the development of the patriotic production increase and economization movement. Luo Dingfeng, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, and others also went to the Huaxin Yarn Factory in Jixian County to inspect the propaganda and mobilization work of the patriotic production increase and economization competition.
    In addition, the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee and other provincial-level government agencies and organizations jointly organized thirteen inspection teams to inspect work in various factories and mines. Before departure, Comrade Pan Fusheng personally convened a meeting of the members of each inspection team and instructed everyone: This time we go down, everyone should have a humble attitude of learning, go deep into the workshop, investigate and study, think repeatedly, and then draw conclusions. Everyone should cherish the opinions of the workers, listen to the voices and demands of the workers. Help them solve problems in a practical way. Secondly, the actions of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League should be consistent and not separate. Finally, each group is required to contact the provincial-level leading organs once every five days, report once every ten days, and summarize once a month.

    上海若干国营工厂提拔工人干部的初步经验
    在“三反”运动以后，上海若干国营工厂大胆地提拔了大批工人干部，调整了干部成分，使职员和工人之间的关系更趋密切。这不仅解决了目前工业生产部门干部缺乏的问题，而且为今后进一步加强民主管理和进行生产改革创造了条件。
    新提拔的干部一般地都有着积极、负责的精神，并有着和群众密切联系的作风。如新星机器厂的钮炳元从学徒到技师已有十一年的工龄。解放以来，一贯表现积极，在群众中威信很高。自从提拔为副经理以后，他更发扬了深入群众的工作作风，经常到车间帮助工人解决问题。有一次，他发现厂内新装B模装配机经常发生事故，就发动群众找寻发生事故的根由，研究解决的办法。结果杜绝了这种事故的发生。又如上海钢铁公司第一厂打铁间工人顾振武在提拔为生产科副科长以后，已经正确地处理了一些问题。有一次，为了钢锭品质问题，上海钢铁公司第三厂的轧钢工人向一厂的炼钢工人提出了很多意见，相互之间发生了隔阂。顾振武就召集两厂有威信的工人研究，找出了钢锭品质不好的原因，并提出了改进办法，消除了两厂工人之间的隔阂。国营上海第六棉纺织厂清花间工人严志卿自被提拔为车间副主任后，仍然是“扳头”不离手。工人工作忙时，他就帮助大家扫地、和花。吴淞机器厂的刨床工人郑文杰提升为材料科长的第一天，因为各工场到处给打电话，他就被一些事务工作缠住了。他分析了一天内电话的内容，采取了合理的措施，跳出了事务的圈子。接着他就动员群众整理该厂仓库旁边堆积的大批旧材料，经过一个月的努力，把仓库整理得井井有条，使积压的材料得到充分的运用。
    工人群众对提拔工人当干部的措施十分拥护，他们提出保证完成生产计划来支持新干部的工作。有的工人高兴得几夜不睡，说：“做了几十年工，没见过工人当厂长。”他们真正体会到工人做主人不是空话，而是在共产党领导下的现实。因之，广大职工对党更加信赖和拥护，党在群众中的威信也大大提高。
    各厂提拔干部的方法，基本上有两种：第一种是群众推荐，领导批准的方法。新星机器厂、国营上海第一棉纺织厂、第三棉纺织厂都是这样作的。其具体做法：一、广泛地进行宣传教育，宣布缺额干部的职务、名额和选拔干部的标准、方法；然后由党内到党外，由干部到群众普遍进行讨论，使党员以至非党群众明确地认识提拔工人干部的意义。二、领导方面掌握一个车间或一个单位来进行这一工作，借以吸取经验，指导全厂。三、具体步骤是：首先由小组推荐提拔对象，经过评比确定后，交车间支部通过；接着公布推荐提拔对象的名单，广泛征求群众意见，然后，根据群众意见，对原有名单进行修正或补充；最后按干部管理手续，分别送上级领导机关审查批准。这种方法既可以正确地挑选人才，又可以使干部更深刻地认识必须更好地为人民服务，才能得到群众的拥护。但是，采用这种作法的部门必须具有下列两个条件：一、群众经过比较深入的发动；二、党组织能够发挥核心作用。否则，是不能作好的。
    第二种是领导提名、群众通过的方法。具体做法：一是领导方面直接委派；二是领导方面提出名单，要求党员、团员在群众中进行宣传，保证群众举手通过。这种作法常常不易得到群众的拥护，甚至引起群众反对；同时新干部本身也有顾虑，惟恐得不到群众支持，做不好工作。
    总括这次提拔工人干部的工作，有着如下的初步经验：
    一、经过几次大的政治运动，各工厂都涌现了大批积极分子。在这种情况下，采取大胆、大量提拔工人干部的方针是完全正确的。但是要贯彻这一方针，领导方面必须明确认识提拔工人干部对国家经济建设的重要意义，在党内外进行深入的动员教育，一方面要消除某些工人因为“文化低”、“领导能力弱”而不敢做领导工作的自卑心理，同时要纠正某些人因为不能得到提拔而产生的消极嫉妒的不正确的态度。如此，才能正确地贯彻大胆、大量提拔工人干部的方针。
    二、必须坚持执行“德”“才”兼备的原则，才能选拔出真正优秀的工人干部。这种干部应具备下列三个条件：（一）历史清楚，政治可靠，立场坚定；（二）作风正派，大公无私，能联系群众；
    （三）生产、工作中一贯表现积极，并有一定的工作能力和技术水平。有的工厂在提拔干部中提出过高的要求，限制了对某些积极分子的提拔，这是不对的。
    三、充分发动群众，认真培养积极分子，是大量提拔工人干部的基础。经验证明：群众发动得愈广泛、深入，涌现出来的积极分子也就愈多，选拔干部的条件也就更好。因为只有充分地发动了群众，才能真正发现人材，那些真正有技术、有才能而且和群众有联系的老年工人也才有可能毫无遗漏地被提拔起来。领导方面对于在政治运动和生产运动中涌现出来的积极分子、工作模范、劳动模范、新纪录创造者，应当有计划地进行培养教育，使其成为提拔干部的对象，以便源源不绝地提拔到领导岗位上来。
    四、注意提高新干部的工作能力，是提拔干部工作中的一个重要问题。因此，当新干部接受新的工作任务后，党组织应当帮助他了解全盘情况和工作制度，随时注意解决他们在工作上、思想上的问题，并帮助他们制订工作计划。上海化工厂通过座谈会，互相介绍思想情况和工作方法，给新干部启示很大。
    另外，要注意解决新干部的困难。如果新干部的文化水平低，即调配文化高的同志做他们的助手；凡有关生产问题，都要和新干部共同研究，发挥他们的工作才能。另外，尽可能地开办各种训练班，提高其政治觉悟、技术水平和文化水平；同时，还要防止新干部骄傲自满，脱离群众。
    五、在提拔工人干部的工作中，必须正确地解决以下几个具体问题：（一）在提拔工人干部时，除应注意大量提拔工人外，对职员中表现较好，历史清楚，又有技术，具备干部条件者，也应注意提拔；
    （二）注意提拔老年技术工人和培养青年工人；
    （三）注意保持车间一定的骨干和熟练工人，不应使脱离生产者过多而影响生产；（四）对新干部的工资一般应按新职位发给，对有同等能力和技术被提为党、工、团工作的干部，原则上应给以同等技术工人的待遇，最少也不能低于原来的工资，以免影响其家庭生活及本人的工作情绪。
    中共平原省委书记潘复生、罗玉川等
    率领干部下厂下乡检查工作
    中共平原省委为推动全省工农业爱国增产节约竞赛运动等工作，巩固“三反”运动的成果，树立联系群众的新作风，特组织大批干部下厂下乡检查工作。省委第一书记潘复生率领一批干部赴焦作煤矿检查爱国增产节约运动的开展情况，省委第二书记、省人民政府副主席罗玉川、省委组织部部长刘宴春率领一批干部赴黄河沿岸各县检查防汛工作，省委宣传部部长张承先将率领一批干部赴菏泽、湖西两专区检查爱国增产节约运动和发动群众的工作，省委秘书长杨珏率领一批干部赴濮阳、聊城专区检查爱国增产节约运动的开展情形。省委宣传部副部长罗定枫等亦赴汲县华新纱厂检查爱国增产节约竞赛运动的宣传鼓动工作。
    此外，平原省委又和其他的省级机关团体联合组织了十三个检查组，分赴各厂矿检查工作。在出发之前，潘复生同志亲自召集各检查组人员开会，指示大家：这次下去，大家要抱虚心学习的态度，要深入车间，调查研究，反复思考，然后作出结论。大家要珍贵工人的意见，听取工人的呼声和要求。切实帮助他们解决问题。其次党、政府、工会、青年团的行动应当一致，不能各干一套。最后要求各小组五天和省级领导机关联系一次，十天作一次报告，每月作一次总结。
