Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st. The work of formulating production increase and conservation plans by state-owned and public-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region has been basically completed. According to incomplete statistics, the planned total value has reached 13.54 million tons of grain. In order to fulfill and exceed the production increase and conservation plans, factories and mines are signing collective contracts one after another, mobilizing workers to vigorously promote various advanced experiences, and further guiding the patriotic production increase and conservation movement to a new climax.

This year, the time for formulating plans in various factories was generally shortened by one-half to one-third compared to last year, and the potential capabilities tapped were also more fully developed than last year. Since May 7, when Comrade Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, called for the launch of a production increase and conservation movement, most state-owned factories and mines and some local public-owned factories and mines had basically completed the mass plan-making work by around June 20. The rest had also completed the plan-making work by the first half of July.

This year's production increase and conservation movement in state-owned and public-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region was launched after the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. The political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the workers have been unprecedentedly enhanced. Therefore, the movement has presented a mass upsurge of creativity from the beginning, and a large number of advanced production methods have emerged. According to statistics from 67 factories in Shenyang and Harbin alone, in the ten days to one month after the start of the plan-making work, more than 21,800 various "tricks" and rationalization proposals have emerged in the movement, and many of these "tricks" have solved key problems in the production of various factories. Workers also incorporated the production targets they expected to achieve after learning "tricks" and promoting advanced experiences into the production increase and conservation plans of groups, workshops, and the entire factory as goals to strive for. Therefore, the planned targets proposed from top to bottom are increasing at each level. For example, the original planned target of the Northeast Mechanical Industry Bureau was equivalent to 400,000 tons of grain. After the workers of various factories found "tricks," tapped potential, and promoted advanced experiences, the planned target increased to 1.25 million tons.

However, the development of the movement still has an unbalanced phenomenon, especially some units have developed a tendency to neglect quality. When formulating production increase and conservation plans, they did not put improving product quality in the primary position. In order to overcome and prevent this tendency, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast People's Government promptly instructed various factories and mines in June to conduct a group plan review and "quality make-up" work, mobilizing all workers to discuss quality indicators, formulate specific technical measures plans, and strictly implement inspection systems and technical operating procedures. Industrial leading organs and factories and mines in various places have also adopted various effective methods to study and deploy this work. The Third Machine Factory of the Mechanical Industry Bureau first convened a forum of factory directors, chief engineers, and inspection section chiefs, and criticized the shortcomings of not paying attention to product quality in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Then, the responsible cadres made self-criticisms at the workers' congress. Subsequently, a "quality uncovering movement" was launched throughout the factory, enabling all cadres and workers to recognize the importance of improving product quality. Through this movement, 104 quality-related shortcomings were exposed and improved. For example, in the past, the rework rate of a certain type of drill bit often accounted for 70%, and there was also noise when it was turned on; now the rework rate has been reduced to below 30%, and all noise has been eliminated. Many other factories and mines have also adopted steps and methods similar to those of the Third Machine Factory to correct the tendency to neglect quality, and added specific content to improve quality to the original incomplete production increase plan.

Currently, factories and mines are conducting or brewing to sign collective contracts; the competition movement will develop rapidly and widely with the signing of contracts. More than 30 factories in Shenyang have fully launched the competition, and some factories and mines and a large number of groups in other regions have also successively challenged and responded to each other. In order to regularize the competition movement, factories and mines will vigorously promote various advanced experiences. Now, factories and mines are taking the promotion of advanced experiences as the main content of organizing and leading the competition movement, further mobilizing workers to overcome various conservative ideas, and striving to complete and exceed the production increase and conservation plan.

### 东北工业增产节约计划基本制定  总值一千三百余万吨粮食

    东北工业增产节约计划基本制定
    总值一千三百余万吨粮食
    【新华社东北一日电】东北区国营和公营厂矿制订增产节约计划的工作已基本结束，据不完全统计：计划总值已达一千三百五十四万吨粮食。各厂矿为了完成与超过增产节约的计划，正纷纷签订集体合同，发动职工大力推广各种先进经验，把爱国增产节约运动进一步引向高潮。
    今年各厂制订计划的时间普遍比去年缩短二分之一到三分之一，所发掘的潜在能力也都比去年更为充分。自五月七日东北人民政府高岗主席号召开展增产节约运动后，到六月二十日左右，大部分国营厂矿和部分地方公营厂矿，都已基本完成了群众性的订计划工作，其余到七月上半月止，也已先后结束了订计划的工作。
    今年东北区国营和公营厂矿的增产节约运动，是在“三反”、“五反”运动的伟大胜利后开展的。职工们的政治热情和生产积极性空前提高，因此运动一开始就呈现了一种群众性的创造热潮，先进生产方法大量涌现。仅据沈阳和哈尔滨两市六十七个工厂在订计划工作开始后十天到一个月中的统计。运动中已出现了各种大小“窍门”和合理化建议两万一千八百多个，其中并有不少“窍门”解决了各厂生产中的关键性问题。职工并把预计学会“窍门”和推广先进经验后可能达到的生产指标，订入小组、车间和全厂的增产节约计划中去，作为奋斗的目标。因此从上而下提出的计划指标，都是逐级增加。如东北机械工业管理局原计划指标等于四十万吨粮食，经过各厂职工找“窍门”、挖潜力、推广先进经验后订出的计划，便增加到一百二十五万吨。
    但是，运动的开展仍存在着不平衡的现象，特别是有些单位发生了忽视质量的偏向，在制订增产节约计划的时候，没有把提高产品质量放在首要地位。为了克服和防止这种偏向，中共中央东北局和东北人民政府曾在六月间及时地指示各厂矿进行一次小组计划复查和“质量补课”的工作，发动全体职工讨论质量指标，订出具体的技术措施计划，严格贯彻检查制度和技术操作规程。各地工业领导机关和厂矿，也采取了各种有效方法来研究与布置这一工作。机械工业管理局第三机器厂，首先召开了厂长、主任工程师和检查科长座谈会，本着批评与自我批评的精神，批判了不重视产品质量的缺点。接着，负责干部又在职工大会上进行了检讨。随后，在全厂开展一个“质量大揭盖运动”，使全厂干部和职工认识提高产品质量的重要性。经过这个运动揭发出一百零四项有关质量的缺点，并且进行了改进。如过去生产的某种牙轮，退修品常占百分之七十，开动起来还有燥音；现在的退修品已降低到百分之三十以下，并全部消灭了燥音。其他许多厂矿也采取了类似机器三厂的步骤和办法，端正了忽视质量的偏向，使原来不够全面的增产计划，增加了提高质量的具体内容。
    目前，各厂矿正在进行或酝酿签订集体合同；竞赛运动将随着合同的签订，迅速而广泛的开展起来。沈阳已有三十多个工厂全面开展竞赛，其他地区的部分厂矿和大批小组，也先后相互提出挑战和应战。为了使竞赛运动经常化，各厂矿将大力推广各种先进经验。现在，各厂矿都把推广先进经验作为组织和领导竞赛运动的主要内容，进一步发动职工克服各种保守思想，为完成和超过增产节约计划而努力。
