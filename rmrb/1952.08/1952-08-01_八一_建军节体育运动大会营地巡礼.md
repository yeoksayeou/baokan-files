    Camp Tour of the "August 1st" Army Day Sports Meet
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Nai Yin
    At five o'clock in the morning, the camps of the PLA delegations and the Volunteer Army returnee delegation participating in the "August 1st" Army Day Sports Meet awakened. The green military tents, arranged in the large woods, opened one after another in the thin morning mist. A crisp whistle summoned people: "Get up!" Loudspeakers set up on trucks and under the shade of trees immediately broadcast cheerful songs, notices from the organizing committee of the conference, and letters of determination and guarantees from many delegations. Men and women athletes, wearing sports clothing of various colors—red, green, blue, white, and yellow—and waving their dark, strong arms, ran towards the washrooms. Members of the literary and artistic delegations also poured out of their tents. The songs of young soldiers, the sounds of accordions and violins, echoed in the deep green woods. A tense, enthusiastic, and pleasant day began in the delegation camps.
    Anyone who enters the delegation camps cannot suppress the excitement in their hearts: "Ah, what a neat barracks!" Walking along the wide tree-lined road, you can see rows of square, pointed-top military tents; they are almost like a town hidden deep in the dense forest. Here, there are "streets" and "alleys." Wooden signs erected at the "street corners" indicate the masters of each street: "Northwest Military Region Delegation," "Central South Military Region Delegation," and so on. The industrious and neat people's soldiers have kept every "street" very flat and clean. They have dug drainage ditches, square spittoons, and fruit peel pits outside the tents. The soldiers' towels are neatly hung on the ropes between the big trees. Dark green infantry helmets and bright yellow rider's boots are arranged on the shelves. Everything is in good order. The health committee members or health officers of each delegation go in and out of the tents, supervising and inspecting the hygiene inside and outside.
    How can one describe people's impressions of life in the delegation camps? In the words of Zhang Juren, the battalion commander and field event athlete of the Northeast Military Region Delegation: "This is the victory of the people, a grand review of the strength of the people's army, a great gathering of troops from all directions!" It is these delegations and the troops they represent that defend the land and sky, the seas and borders of our great motherland; they defend the construction cause of our great motherland with its infinitely beautiful prospects. In the camps, many athletes are spreading the story of Commander He Long's concern for the sports movement of the troops with admiration. Representatives from the Southwest Military Region said that they would bring back the advanced sports experience of their fraternal troops from the conference to the remote southwest to defend the borders of the motherland. In the Huadong Military Region delegation, there is the famous maritime reconnaissance soldier Ji Baichang, who can float in the ocean for forty li. He came from the frontline of coastal defense in Fujian, and their troops are vigilantly guarding the eastern seas of the motherland. He said, "All the comrades in our reconnaissance company are looking forward to me bringing the swimming experience of our fraternal troops to them." The members of the Northwest Military Region delegation, wearing green sports uniforms, and the army they represent have created miracles on the vast grasslands of the northwest: turning wilderness into fertile fields and setting a production example for the working people of the whole country. Their slogan is: "To strengthen national defense, to accelerate economic construction." The people's navy, "living at sea and being guests on land," waving ribbons, and the air force representatives wearing sky-blue sports uniforms, also appeared in the camps with robust postures. These young guardians of the seas and skies are watching the provocations of imperialism with stern eyes. Naval swimming athlete Xiong Haifa said: "Train our bodies well and defend the seas of the motherland!" People walked past the tents of the Military Academy delegation with respect. These battle-hardened commanders also actively participated in the sports meet, setting an example for the young soldiers.
    When the representatives of the Volunteer Army from the Korean front entered the camp, the woods immediately burst into cheers. Athletes from the PLA delegations rushed to greet the famous air force heroes Zhang Jihui, Zhao Baotong, and Liu Yudi. They scrutinized these air warriors who had repeatedly performed meritorious deeds and said excitedly: "You have worked hard!" Volunteer Army athletes wearing the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea commemorative medals emerged on the avenues. Among them were Zang Xiangchen, a hero of the transportation front in Korea, and Bao Rui, a meritorious hero of the "Ten Thousand Years" unit who struck fear into the enemy's hearts. They have made brilliant contributions in the fight against the American aggressors, and now they are invited to participate in the conference. They said: "Our Volunteer Army on the Korean front is also strong and powerful!"
    The meeting of the delegations from all directions moved many people. On the tree-lined roads, in the squares, and in the tents, athletes from different units could be seen chatting in groups of three or five, asking each other about their successful sports experiences. They shook hands again and again, repeating excitedly: "We must learn from you!" The young soldiers of the Central South Military Region wrote on the blackboard: "Comrades, you have worked hard." Zhao Mingding and Xun Dengyan, athletes from the Northwest, and Chen Tianlu, an athlete from the Northeast Military Region, who had participated together in the sports delegation to attend the Czechoslovak Army Day in 1951, met again at this conference. They greeted each other from afar: "Great, old comrades, we meet again!" They asked each other about their progress over the past year and were determined to learn new things at this sports meet.
    When the hands of the clock pointed to eight o'clock, the most intense activity of the day began in the camp. All the athletes shouted the same slogan: "Don't give up a minute of exercise!" Teams of ball players, tanned by the sun, dressed and set off to participate in pre-conference practice matches. Motors also began to roar, and motorcycle athletes rushed out of the camp, circling and chasing each other in the pine forests and avenues, practicing the super-level techniques they had created, such as jumping ditches and flying wheels. Heroic men and women riders rode healthy horses galloping across the square, practicing various techniques. The sound of whistles came from deep in the dense forest, and the members of the tug-of-war competition were shouting: "Pull hard, heave-ho!" Many running athletes appeared on the tree-lined avenues. Miao Zhiqing, a track and field athlete from the Northeast Military Region, led his comrades to run. Whether in the hot noon or in the drizzling rain, he never stopped his exercise. They wiped the sweat from their bodies with towels and said: "Let's do it! The more difficult it is, the better the results we can achieve." The female track and field athletes put forward the slogan: "Turn the camp into a playground!" They started building sand pits near their tents and practiced high jump and long jump. In the tents, the soldiers participating in the cultural tests were assiduously reviewing their lessons. They said: "Learn more for one day, take one more step forward!" Everyone in the camp's mind was focused in one direction: to create better results and make the conference a success.
    When night fell, the electric lights hanging on the branches shone brightly, and teams of athletes returned singing, raising loud laughter rolling in the forest. This was the most pleasant moment of the day. The young men and women actors of the literary and artistic delegations became the singers of the woods. They danced and sang in a circle, and the orchestra also played happy tunes. Traveling along the rows of tents, each place had its own characteristics. The members of the literary and artistic delegations sang to their hearts' content about their different battles and lives. Here, the members of the literary and artistic delegation of the Southwest Military Region were dancing graceful ethnic minority dances. Since advancing into the southwestern border regions, they have faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's policy of uniting ethnic minorities and have become loyal protectors of the various ethnic minorities in the southwest. There, was the amateur song and dance troupe of the logistics delegation, who created a transport dance describing the steel transport line. ...... The athletes of the sports teams who had exercised all day, and the young riders, also forgot the fatigue of the day. They ran out of the bathrooms and washrooms and joined this joyful chorus.
    When the loudspeaker broadcast the last piece of music of the day, the camp immediately fell silent. In front of the tents, stood teams of representatives, team leaders, and captains began to summarize the day's work. In the hearts of all the athletes, rang a loud slogan: Exercise to strengthen the body, defend the motherland.

    “八一”建军节体育运动大会营地巡礼
    新华社记者  耐因
    早晨五点钟，参加“八一”建军节体育运动大会的解放军各部代表队和志愿军归国代表团的营地醒来了。排列在大树林里的绿色军用帐篷，在晨曦薄雾中相继打开。清脆的哨音召唤着人们：“起床了！”设置在卡车上和树荫下的扩音器，随即播送出愉悦的歌声、大会筹备处的通知和许多代表队的决心书、保证书。穿着红、绿、蓝、白、黄各色运动服装，挥着黧黑健壮的臂膀的男女运动员们，向着洗脸间跑去。文艺代表队的队员们，也涌出了营帐。青年战士们的歌声，手风琴和提琴的声浪，在深绿的树林里荡漾着。代表队营地紧张、热烈、愉快的一日开始了。
    每一个走进代表队营地的人，都无法抑制住内心的激动：“啊，好一座整齐的兵营！”沿着宽阔的林荫公路走去，可以看到一排排方形尖顶的军用篷帐，它们几乎像一个深藏在密林中的镇市。这里有着一条条“大街”和“小巷”。竖立在“街口”的木牌，指示出每一条街道的主人：“西北军区代表队”“中南军区代表队”……。勤劳、整洁的人民战士们，把每一条“街道”整理得很平坦很洁净。他们在帐篷外面挖了疏水沟，方形的吐痰坑和果屑坑。在大树和大树之间的绳索上，整齐地挂着战士们的毛巾。在搁物架上，排列着暗绿的步兵钢盔、澄黄的骑手马靴。一切都井然有秩。各代表队的卫生委员或卫生干事，出入在各个帐篷，督促和检查着室内室外的卫生。
    怎样来描写人们对代表队营地生活的观感呢？按照东北军区代表队田赛选手、营长张居仁的话说：“这是人民的胜利，人民军队力量的大检阅，各路大军的大会师！”就是这些代表队和他们所代表的各路大军，捍卫着我们伟大祖国的地面和天空，海洋和边疆；捍卫着我们伟大祖国有着无限美好远景的建设事业。在营地上，许多体育选手都怀着景仰的心情传说着贺龙司令员关心部队体育运动的故事。西南军区的代表们说：他们要把大会上兄弟部队先进的体育经验带回遥远的西南，保卫祖国的边疆。在华东军区代表里，有着著名的能在海洋里浮行四十里的海上侦察兵伋百昌。他是从福建海防前哨赶来的，他们的部队正警惕地守卫着祖国东部的海洋。他说：“我们侦察连全体同志盼着我把兄弟部队的游泳经验带给他们。”穿着绿色运动服的西北军区代表队队员们和他们所代表的大军在西北广阔的草原上创造了奇迹：把荒野变成良田，给全国劳动人民树立了生产榜样。他们的口号是：为了增强国防力量，为了加紧经济建设。舞着飘带的、“海上住家、陆上作客”的人民海军和穿着天蓝色运动服的空军代表们，也以壮健的姿态出现在营地上。这些海洋和天空的青年卫士，正以严峻的眼光注视着帝国主义的挑衅行为。海军游泳选手熊海发说：“锻炼好身体，保卫祖国的海洋！”人们怀着尊敬的心情走过军事学院代表队的帐篷。这些身经百战的指挥员，也积极地参加了运动大会，他们给青年战士们树立了榜样。
    当来自朝鲜前线的志愿军的代表们进入营地时，树林里立刻欢腾起来，解放军各代表队的选手们纷纷争先慰问著名的空军英雄张积慧、赵宝桐和刘玉堤，他们端详着这些屡建功勋的空中勇士，激动地说：“你们辛苦了！”大道上涌现了佩带着抗美援朝纪念章的志愿军选手。他们之中有朝鲜运输战线上的英雄人物臧祥琛，有使敌人胆寒的“万岁”部队的大功功臣鲍瑞……他们在打击美国侵略军的战斗中立下了光辉的功勋，现在他们应邀来参加大会，他们说：“我们朝鲜前线的志愿军，也是兵强马壮！”
    各路大军代表队的会晤，使得许多人感动了。在林荫道上，在广场上，在帐篷里，到处可以看到不同单位的选手在三五成群地攀谈着，互相询问着成功的体育经验。他们一次又一次地握手，兴奋地重复着一句话：“要向你们学习呵！”中南军区的青年战士们，在黑板上写着：“同志们，辛苦了。”曾经在一九五一年一起参加体育代表队出席捷克斯洛伐克建军节的西北选手赵明鼎、荀登彦和东北军区选手陈天禄，在这次大会上又会面了。他们老远就招呼着：“好啊，老战友又碰到一块了！”他们互相询问着一年来的进步，并且决心要在这次运动会上学习到更新的东西。
    当时针指到八点的时候，营地里开始了一天中最紧张的活动。所有的运动员们都喊出同一个口号：“不放弃一刻钟的锻炼机会！”一队队被太阳晒得黝黑的球类选手，着装出发去参加会前练习比赛。马达也开始轰响起来，摩托车选手们冲出营地，在松林里、大道上回旋着，追逐着，他们在熟练着自己创造的跳沟、飞轮等超等技术。雄赳赳的男女骑士们乘着健马在广场上飞奔着，演习着各种技术。在密林深处传来哨子的声音，参加拔河比赛的队员们在呼喊着：“用力拉呀，嗨哟！”林荫大道上出现了许多赛跑的选手。东北军区的竞赛选手妙志清带领着他的战友奔跑着，不论在炎热的中午或者是细雨纷落的雨天，也不曾停息过自己的锻炼。他们用毛巾擦一下混身的汗水说：“干吧！愈是艰苦，才能练出成绩。”田赛的女选手们提出口号：“把营地也变成操场！”她们就在自己的帐篷附近动手修起沙坑，练习跳高跳远。在帐篷里，参加文化测验的战士们，孜孜不倦地在温习自己的功课，他们说：“多学一天，多进一步！”营地每个人的心思集中在一个方向：创造更好的成绩，把大会开好。
    夜幕降临的时候，悬挂在树枝上的电灯大放光明，一队队选手高歌归来，在森林里滚腾起大声的欢笑。这是一日间最愉快的时刻。各文艺代表队的年轻的男女演员们，成了树林里的歌手，他们围成一圈歌舞着，合唱着，管弦乐队也吹打起快乐的曲子。沿着一列列帐篷巡行，每一处都有每一处的特色，各文艺代表队的队员们尽情地歌唱着他们不同的战斗和生活。这里，西南军区的文艺代表队的队员们跳着优美的少数民族的舞蹈。他们从挺进西南边疆以来，就忠实地执行着毛主席的团结少数民族的政策，成了西南各少数民族忠诚的保护者，那边是后勤代表队的业余歌舞队，他们自己创造了描述钢铁运输线的运输舞。……运动了一日的体育队选手们，青年的骑士们，也遗忘了一日的疲劳，他们从沐浴间、洗脸间跑出来，卷进这欢欣的合唱队。
    当扩音器播送出一日间最后的乐曲的时候，营地立刻肃静无声。在帐篷的前面，站着一队队的代表，领队和队长们开始总结一日的工作。在所有的选手的心里，响亮着一句口号：锻炼身体、保卫祖国。
