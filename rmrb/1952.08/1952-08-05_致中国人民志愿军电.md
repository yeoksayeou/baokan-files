    Telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    To Commander Peng and all comrades of the esteemed Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    We deeply thank you for protecting the security of the motherland and the happy lives of our people of all ethnic groups.
    You are the outstanding sons and daughters of the great motherland. You have been fighting heroically on the Korean battlefield for almost two years to help the Korean people fight the American aggressors and to protect the security of the motherland. Your brilliant victories have dealt a heavy blow to American imperialism, and promoted and expanded the worldwide peace movement. We have received a profound education in patriotism and internationalism from your great practical actions.
    The American aggressors are attempting to make a desperate struggle, and have recently repeatedly violated our Northeast airspace, provoking our Chinese people, which we cannot tolerate. We Muslims will unite more closely, strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and vigorously support your struggle on the Korean battlefield, in order to answer the provocation of the American aggressors.

    你们是伟大祖国的优秀儿女，你们为了帮助朝鲜人民打击美国侵略者，为了保卫祖国安全，在朝鲜战场进行英勇的战斗，已经快有两年了。你们的辉煌胜利，给美帝国主义以沉重的打击，推动和扩大了全世界的和平运动，我们从你们伟大的实际行动中，受到了爱国主义和国际主义的深刻教育。
    美国侵略者企图作垂死的挣扎，最近又连续侵犯我国东北领空，向我们中国人民进行挑衅，这是我们不能容忍的。我们伊斯兰教，将更紧密地团结起来，加强抗美援朝的工作，大力支援你们在朝鲜战场上的斗争，以此来回答美国侵略者的挑衅。
