Xinhua News Agency, August 24th:  The Chairman of the Mongolian Committee for the Defense of Peace, Siringdib, recently sent a letter to Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, stating that the Mongolian people have formed a delegation to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.  The letter said that the Mongolian people unanimously support the declaration and resolutions of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. We believe that the declaration of the preparatory meeting in Beijing has clearly stipulated the issues that must be discussed at the upcoming conference, and special emphasis should be placed on discussing the cessation of the Korean War, stopping the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China, signing a peace treaty with Japan, and stopping colonial wars.

Xinhua News Agency, August 25th:  Karachi dispatch: Preparations for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference are enthusiastically underway throughout Pakistan. Ghulam Muhammad Khan and Shaqur, the Pakistani representatives who attended the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference held in Beijing in June, successively introduced the resolutions of the preparatory meeting and the agenda of the peace conference to the Pakistani press after returning home. Many major newspapers throughout Pakistan published the content of their talks. The All-Pakistan Peace Committee has translated the declaration and resolutions passed by the preparatory meeting into Urdu and distributed them in large quantities throughout the country.

The Pakistani people unanimously believe that the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference represents the aspirations of the Asian people. Peace committees throughout Pakistan are presiding over the election and invitation of representatives to attend the peace conference. The All-Pakistan Peace Committee has sent invitations to various political parties, major associations, and prominent figures in Pakistan to participate in the preparation work for the peace conference and to send representatives. On August 10th, people from all walks of life in the Northwest Frontier Province, under the chairmanship of Pir Manki Sharif, Chairman of the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, held a peace conference in Peshawar, at which the Provincial Peace Committee was established and representatives were elected to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The All-Pakistan Peace Committee recently sent a letter to the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, expressing its determination to overcome all obstacles and participate in the conference.

Xinhua News Agency:  The Khmer people warmly support the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference recently received a telegram from Son Ngoc Minh, Chairman of the Khmer National United Front, which stated: "On behalf of the Khmer people, we warmly welcome the declaration of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. We unanimously agree with all the issues proposed by the preparatory meeting for discussion at the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing at the end of September 1952. We are willing to thoroughly implement all resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and, together with the Vietnamese and Laotian people, vigorously promote the war of resistance against the French colonialists and American imperialist interventionists, strive for the independence and freedom of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and unremittingly fight for the defense of peace in Asia and the world."
