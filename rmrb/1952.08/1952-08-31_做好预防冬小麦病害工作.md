    Do a Good Job in Preventing Winter Wheat Diseases
    In some areas, winter wheat is about to be sown. In order to reduce wheat diseases and insect pests, all localities should pay attention to preventing wheat diseases during the sowing season.
    Wheat has many diseases. Different diseases require different methods for treatment and prevention. Some people think that one method can cure all diseases, which is incorrect. The pathogen of wheat stinking smut attaches to the surface of the seeds, and can be killed by treating the seeds with medicine or soaking them in hot water. The pathogen of wheat loose smut exists inside the seeds, and must be treated with the variable temperature soaking method. This involves first soaking the seeds in cold water to allow the pathogens to germinate, and then soaking them in hot water to kill the pathogens. The pathogen of wheat nematode disease is a type of nematode. Infected wheat grains are lighter than ordinary wheat grains. In order to remove diseased wheat, good wheat and diseased wheat can be separated using a screening device, or salt water can be used for seed selection.
    When using chemical seed treatment, attention must be paid to the dosage of the chemical. Too little will have no effect, and too much will cause chemical damage. When using hot water soaking or variable temperature soaking, attention must be paid to controlling the water temperature and soaking time. Raising the water temperature or prolonging the soaking time may kill the seeds; excessively shortening the time or lowering the temperature will reduce the effectiveness. Therefore, technical guidance must be strengthened when carrying out these tasks. In areas where conditions permit, it is best to form several groups, led by experienced model workers or activists. In many wheat fields, mole crickets and wireworms are harmful underground. In some areas, wheat seedlings are often harmed by locusts after emergence. Attention should be paid to preventing and controlling these insect pests.

    做好预防冬小麦病害工作
    有些地区的冬小麦就要播种了。为了减少小麦的病害和虫害，在播种时期，各地应该注意做好预防小麦的病害工作。
    小麦的病害是很多的。不同的病害，要用不同的方法来治疗和预防。有人以为一法可治百病，这是不对的。小麦腥黑穗病的病原菌附着在种子的表面，用药拌种或用热水浸种，就可把病菌杀死。小麦散黑穗病的病原菌存在于种子内部，必须用变温浸种法来治疗。这就是先用冷水浸泡种籽，使病菌萌动，再用热水浸泡，以便把病菌杀死。小麦线虫病的病原是一种线虫，染病的麦粒较普通麦粒为轻；为了剔除病麦，可用汰除器分离好麦病麦，或用盐水选种。
    实行药剂拌种，必须注意药剂用量，量少没有效果，量多会发生药害。实行热水浸种或变温浸种，要注意掌握水的温度和浸泡的时间，提高水的温度或延长浸泡时间，可能把种子烫死；过分缩短时间或减低温度，就会减低效能。因此，在进行这些工作时，必须加强技术指导；有条件的地区，最好组成若干小组，由有经验的劳动模范或积极分子掌握进行。许多地区的麦田有蝼蛄、金针虫在地下为害，某些地区在麦苗出土以后，常常遭受土蝗为害；对这些虫害都要注意加以防治。
