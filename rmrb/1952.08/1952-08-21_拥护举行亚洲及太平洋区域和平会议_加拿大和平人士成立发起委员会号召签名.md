Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 20th – News: The Canadian people are actively preparing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Canadian peace advocates have established an inauguration committee, with Finlay McKerg as secretary, to carry out preparatory work nationwide. The committee recently issued a statement pointing out that the Canadian people have shown great concern for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The issues to be discussed at the conference will affect many aspects of Canadian life. The statement also called on the Canadian people to support the proposal to send a delegation to attend the peace conference. Currently, the inauguration committee is issuing signature books to peace advocates, trade unions, and members of other mass organizations across the country, calling on them to sign the signature books in support of the peace conference and to write down their demands and hopes for the peace conference, to be used as credentials for the Canadian representatives attending the peace conference. Canadian peace advocates have also decided to hold a meeting in August to develop plans for further peace movements in the next four to five months.

Jennison, the Canadian representative who participated in the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, is promoting the achievements of the meeting after returning home. At a recent press conference held in Toronto, she also denounced the crimes of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare. She pointed out that although she had not been to Northeast China, she had personally seen conclusive evidence of the American aggressor troops conducting germ warfare in Beijing. She had spoken with some Chinese doctors who had conducted on-site investigations and had seen the signature books of dozens of Chinese Catholics and Christians protesting against American germ warfare. At the meeting, Jennison also played recordings brought back from China of the confessions of American captured pilots Enak and Quinn describing their participation in germ warfare in Korea, which aroused great attention from the reporters.

    【新华社二十日讯】多伦多消息：加拿大人民积极筹备参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。加拿大的和平人士已经成立了发起委员会，由芬雷·马肯辑担任秘书，在全国开展筹备工作。这个委员会最近发表了一项声明，指出加拿大人民对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议表示了很大的关心。会议所要讨论的问题将关涉到加拿大生活的许多方面。声明并要求加拿大人民支持选派代表团出席和平会议的主张。现在，发起委员会正在向全国和平拥护者、工会及其他群众组织的成员发出签名书，号召他们在签名书上签名拥护和平会议，并写上他们对于和平会议的要求和希望，以便把它作为委托书交给出席和平会议的加拿大代表。加拿大和平人士还决定在八月间举行会议，制订今后四、五个月内进一步开展和平运动的计划。
    参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的加拿大代表詹尼逊回国之后，正在国内宣传会议的成就。她最近在多伦多举行的记者招待会上，并痛斥了美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行。她指出：她虽然没有到过中国的东北，但是她曾在北京亲眼看到美国侵略军进行细菌战的确凿证据。她曾经和一些作过现场调查的中国医师们谈过话，并且看到了中国几十个天主教徒和基督教徒抗议美国进行细菌战的签名书。詹尼逊在会上并放送了由中国带回的美国被俘飞行员伊纳克和奎恩叙述他们在朝鲜参加细菌战的供词录音，引起记者们的很大注意。
