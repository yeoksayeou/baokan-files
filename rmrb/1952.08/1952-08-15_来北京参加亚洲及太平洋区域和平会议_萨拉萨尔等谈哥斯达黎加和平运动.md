Xinhua News Agency, August 14th - Our reporter recently interviewed Latin American representatives from Costa Rica, Salazar, Saintz, Gabaza, and Murillo, who came to Beijing to attend the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. They were delayed en route for some reason and only arrived in Beijing on July 31st and will remain in Beijing to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. They answered the reporter's questions as follows:

Q: What are your opinions on the declaration of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the proposals for various preparatory works for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference?

In their answers, the representatives all emphasized that the "Declaration of the Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference" and "Proposals for Various Preparatory Works for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference," which were adopted by representatives of various countries after extensive democratic discussions, demonstrated the peace aspirations of the people of all countries, and they unanimously expressed their support. Salazar said: The opinions put forward in the declaration and proposals are very correct because they were made after many discussions at the preparatory meeting and are acceptable. Murillo said: The resolution puts forward a method for moving towards universal world peace, which is the desire of all reasonable people in the world. Saintz said: The declaration expresses the ardent desire for peace of the people of all countries, and Eduardo Mora, who arrived in Beijing earlier and supplemented his signature on the declaration, signed on behalf of the people of Costa Rica. Gabaza said: The declaration represents the will and interests of the people of all countries, and it will lead to the strengthening of peace. As a workers' representative, I fully support Eduardo Mora's signature.

Q: How is the peace movement in your country currently developing?

Salazar said: The peace movement in Costa Rica is illegal, but the peace movement is advancing. Labor youth are working hard to make the peace movement penetrate the masses. The police are persecuting peace propaganda, but slogans calling on people to rise up and participate in the peace movement can be seen on walls and cars. Costa Rica has not held a May Day parade for five years, but this year's May Day featured mass parades demanding peace and the restoration of May Day. Saintz said: The peace movement in Costa Rica is more deeply rooted among the working people, and intellectuals are also actively participating in the peace movement. Costa Rica has a population of nearly one million, and 50,000 people have now signed the peace pact declaration. Publications published by women's, youth, and university student organizations regularly publish documents of the peace movement. Saintz emphasized the participation of women in the peace movement, saying: Women participate in all peace organizations, many women work in peace organizations, and they volunteer to sell books and newspapers. Gabaza said: The Costa Rican Peace Committee, trade unions, women's organizations, and revolutionary youth groups are all working for peace. The peace movement led by independent trade unions is militant, and the primary issue it raises at any meeting is peace. Workers participating in the peace movement are often persecuted, and it is difficult for workers to read documents of the peace movement, but workers are deepening the peace movement among the peasants. Many people participated in this year's May Day parade, and the slogans written on the banners were all demanding peace. On the second anniversary of the Korean War, trade unions held many commemorative meetings. Murillo said: The intellectuals of Costa Rica are poor, and most of them teach in schools. Many intellectuals have joined the peace movement. The famous mathematics teacher Yuweilein was fired for participating in the peace movement but continues to promote the peace movement. Outstanding intellectuals such as economist Mora and English and French translation teacher Belata are all participating in the peace movement. Costa Rican Catholics are sympathetic to peace. I am a Catholic, and I support peace, no matter where peace comes from, mankind should support peace.

Q: What are your expectations for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held this autumn?

Salazar said: I hope that peace will be established throughout the world, without peace there is no progress. I came to China from Costa Rica through many places, and I have seen with my own eyes that peace is being created here. A peace conference held in an atmosphere of peace is beneficial to world peace. Murillo said: The peace conference held by representatives selected from honest and conscientious people will have a great impact. Gabaza said: I hope and believe that the peace conference will be conducted in an atmosphere of international friendship, and that the representatives will conduct discussions freely and democratically, so that the resulting resolutions will better serve the struggle for peace. Saintz said: The peace conference will make people understand the dangers of the Korean War and make people understand the seriousness of the Japanese question. Ending the Korean War is a guarantee for world peace.

    来北京参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    萨拉萨尔等谈哥斯达黎加和平运动
    【新华社十四日讯】本社记者日前访问了来北京参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的拉丁美洲哥斯达黎加代表萨拉萨尔，圣兹，加巴扎和穆里洛。他们因故在中途延搁，在七月三十一日才到达北京，将留在北京参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。他们对记者提出的问题回答如下：
    问：你对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议宣言和关于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议各项筹备工作的提议有何意见？
    代表们在回答中都强调指出由各国代表经过广泛的民主的讨论通过的“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议宣言”和“关于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议各项筹备工作的提议”，表现了各国人民的和平愿望，他们一致表示拥护。萨拉萨尔说：宣言和提议中提出的意见很正确，因为它是筹备会议在经过多次讨论后作出的，是可以接受的。穆里洛说：决议提出了走向世界普遍和平的方法，这是世界上所有有理智的人的愿望。圣兹说：宣言表现了各国人民爱好和平的热望，先期到达北京在宣言上补行签名的艾杜亚多·莫拉是代表了哥斯达黎加的人民签名的。加巴扎说：宣言代表了各国人民的意志和利益，它将导向加强和平。作为一个工人代表，我全力支持艾杜亚多·莫拉的签名。
    问：贵国人民的和平运动目前发展情况如何？
    萨拉萨尔说：和平运动在哥斯达黎加是非法的，但和平运动在前进。劳动青年努力使和平运动深入到广大群众中去。警察在迫害和平宣传，但在墙壁和汽车上都可以看到号召人民起来参加和平运动的口号。哥斯达黎加有五年没有举行五一劳动节游行了，但今年的五一节举行了要求和平和恢复劳动节的群众游行。圣兹说：哥斯达黎加的和平运动在劳动人民中比较深入，知识分子也积极参加和平运动。哥斯达黎加人口将近一百万，现在在和平公约宣言上签名的已有五万人。妇女、青年和大学生的组织所出版的刊物都经常刊载和平运动的文件。圣兹着重说明妇女参加和平运动的情况，她说：一切和平组织中都有妇女参加，许多妇女在和平组织中工作，并义务地推销书报。加巴扎说：哥斯达黎加和平委员会、工会、妇女和革命的青年团体都在为和平而工作。独立工会领导的和平运动是有战斗性的，它在任何会议上所提出的首要问题是和平。参加和平运动的工人常受到迫害，工人阅读和平运动的文件是困难的，但工人却正在把和平运动深入到农民中去。今年五一节的游行有很多人参加，标语上写的都是要求和平。在朝鲜战争两周年之时，工会曾举行多次纪念会。穆里洛说：哥斯达黎加的知识分子是贫穷的，大多数在学校教书。许多知识分子参加了和平运动。著名的数学教师尤维雷因参加和平运动被解雇，但仍在继续推进和平运动。经济学家莫拉和英法文翻译教师贝尔拉太等优秀知识分子都参加了和平运动。哥斯达黎加的天主教徒是同情和平的。我是个天主教徒，我是拥护和平的，不管和平在那里产生，人类应该拥护和平。
    问：你对于在今年秋天召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议有何期望？
    萨拉萨尔说：我希望和平在全世界建立起来，没有和平就没有进步。我从哥斯达黎加经过很多地方到中国来，我亲眼看到这里在创造和平。在和平的气氛中召开的和平会议，对世界和平是有益的。穆里洛说：从正直的有良心的人们中间选出的代表举行的和平会议，它的影响将是很大的。加巴扎说：我希望并相信和平会议将在国际友爱的空气中进行，代表们自由地民主地进行讨论，这样得出的决议，将更好地为和平斗争服务。圣兹说：和平会议将使人民了解朝鲜战争的危险性，让人民了解日本问题的严重性。结束朝鲜战争就是对世界和平的保障。
