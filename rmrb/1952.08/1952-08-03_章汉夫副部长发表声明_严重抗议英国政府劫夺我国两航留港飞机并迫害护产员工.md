Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd:

Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government issued a statement on August 2nd, strongly protesting the British government's seizure of the two airlines' aircraft remaining in Hong Kong and persecution of property-protecting employees. The full text of the statement is as follows:

After the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council absurdly accepted the so-called "ownership of China National Aviation Corporation" lawsuit, on July 28th of this year, it actually "awarded" forty aircraft and other assets of the Republic of China remaining in Hong Kong to the so-called "Civil Air Transport Company" of U.S. national Claire Chennault. Then, at midnight on July 28th, the British Hong Kong government dispatched a large number of armed police to raid Kai Tak Airport, where our aircraft and materials were stored, as well as the Bailey Dockyard and the Sun Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, and other warehouse areas, beating, arresting, and detaining all of our employees guarding the assets, and seizing all the assets remaining in Hong Kong belonging to the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Corporation, including seventy aircraft.

Premier Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government solemnly declared as early as December 3, 1949, that the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Corporation belong to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and are under the direct jurisdiction of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Central People's Government. Only our Central People's Government and the personnel entrusted by our Central People's Government have the right to dispose of the assets of the two airlines remaining in Hong Kong. No one is allowed to infringe upon, move, or damage them by any means. However, for more than two years, the British government, complying with the unreasonable demands of the U.S. government, colluded with the Kuomintang remnant group and carried out a series of conspiracies, deliberately seizing this property of the People's Republic of China. At first, it tried every means to prevent these aircraft from taking off and returning to China, then it condoned Kuomintang secret agents and bandits to carry out explosions and sabotage, resulting in the destruction of seven aircraft, and then it consistently played legal tricks, planning a so-called "ownership lawsuit." On May 10, 1950, the British government even issued a so-called "Privy Council Order," illegally detaining all the aircraft and assets of the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Corporation remaining in Hong Kong. Then, the British government, in collusion with U.S. national Chennault, put on a pretentious performance of several "trials" and "judgments" in the British courts at all levels in Hong Kong and London. In addition, the British government has continuously subjected the employees responsible for guarding the aircraft assets of the two airlines in Hong Kong to various unreasonable persecutions. The Central People's Government has repeatedly protested to the British government, sternly denouncing the British government's extremely unfriendly attitude towards the People's Republic of China, and declared that the British government should bear full responsibility for the above-mentioned illegal acts over the past two years.

The Central People's Government believes that the British government's outrageous act of seizing the aforementioned assets of the two airlines remaining in Hong Kong and beating, arresting, and detaining the employees protecting the property is a major manifestation of the British government's following the United States and adopting a hostile attitude towards the People's Republic of China. This incident has aroused great indignation among the people of China. The Central People's Government hereby lodges a serious protest with the British government regarding the above-mentioned seizure and outrageous acts. The British government absolutely has no right to exercise its jurisdiction over the assets of our two airlines remaining in Hong Kong, nor does it have the slightest right to infringe upon, damage, or transfer them. The British government should immediately stop its illegal acts of infringing upon the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, should immediately return the aforementioned state property of our country that it has seized to the personnel entrusted by our Central People's Government for disposal, and should immediately stop the persecution of our property-protecting employees and guarantee their freedom of rights. Otherwise, the British government must bear all the responsibility and all the consequences arising therefrom.

    严重抗议英国政府劫夺我国两航留港飞机并迫害护产员工
    【新华社二日讯】中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长八月二日发表声明，严重抗议英国政府劫夺我国两航留港飞机并迫害护产员工。声明全文如下：
    英国枢密院司法委员会荒谬绝伦地受理了所谓“中央航空公司产权”的诉讼案后，于本年七月二十八日竟又将中华人民共和国留在香港的中央航空公司飞机四十架及其他资财“判给”美国陈纳德的所谓“民用航空运输公司”。接着，在七月二十八日午夜，香港英国政府竟出动大批武装警察突袭存放着我国飞机和物资的香港启德机场以及庇利船厂和新亚药厂等两个仓库地区，殴打、逮捕和拘禁我守护该项资产的全部员工，并劫夺了属于中华人民共和国所有的中国航空公司和中央航空公司的全部留港资产，包括七十架飞机在内。
    我中央人民政府周恩来总理早于一九四九年十二月三日郑重声明，中国航空公司和中央航空公司为我中华人民共和国中央人民政府所有，受中央人民政府民航局直接管辖，两航空公司留在香港的资财，只有我中央人民政府和我中央人民政府委托的人员，才有权处置，决不容许任何人以任何手段侵犯、移动或损坏。然而，两年多来，英国政府顺从美国政府的无理要求，勾结国民党残余集团，进行了一系列的阴谋活动，蓄意劫持我中华人民共和国的该项财产，初则百般阻挠我国的这批飞机起飞回国，继则纵容国民党特务匪徒爆炸破坏，致有七架飞机被毁，再则始终玩弄法律骗局，策划了一套所谓“产权诉讼”。一九五零年五月十日英国政府竟发出所谓“枢密院令”，非法扣押我国留港的中国航空公司和中央航空公司的全部飞机资财。然后，英国政府又伙同美国陈纳德在香港、伦敦各级英国法院内装腔作势地表演了若干次“审理”与“判决”的拙劣把戏。此外，英国政府对于在香港负责守护两航空公司飞机资财的员工则不断加以种种无理的迫害。中央人民政府业已向英国政府一再提出抗议，严正指斥英国政府对中华人民共和国极不友好的态度，并声明英国政府对其两年来的上述种种非法行为应承担全部责任。
    中央人民政府认为，英国政府这次劫夺上述两航公司留港资财及殴打、逮捕和拘禁两公司护产员工的横暴行为，是英国政府追随美国、对中华人民共和国采取敌视态度的重大表现。此事业已激起全中国人民的莫大愤怒。中央人民政府特就上述劫夺和横暴行为向英国政府提出严重抗议。对于我国两航空公司留港的资财，英国政府绝对没有任何权利行使其管辖权，亦绝对没有丝毫权利加以侵犯、损坏和转移。英国政府应该立即停止其侵犯我中华人民共和国主权的非法行为，应该立即将其所劫夺的上述我国国家财产交还给我中央人民政府所委托的人员处置，并应该立即停止对我国护产员工的迫害并保障他们的自由权利。否则，英国政府必须承担由此产生的全部责任与一切后果。
