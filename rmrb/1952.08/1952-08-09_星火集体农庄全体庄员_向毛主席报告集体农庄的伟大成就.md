Respected Chairman Mao: Implementing your great instruction to "get organized," we have gradually developed from mutual aid teams of only four households, established in 1948, into a collective farm with more than sixty member households. We, these impoverished peasants who once owned nothing, have now become collective farm members living a life of plenty. Every family eats fine grains, with two or three dishes at every meal; everyone is covered with brand-new bedding; we have work clothes for labor and festive attire for holidays; last year, thirty-seven member households built houses with glass windows and doors. We have accumulated a large amount of public property: forty-three weeding machines, twenty-one row planters, five threshing machines driven by a seven-horsepower electric motor, one rice head threshing machine, thirteen carts, nine foreign plows, one grass rope making machine, sixty-one cattle, fourteen Berkshire pigs, fifteen local pigs; also a rice mill with four rice milling machines driven by a thirty-horsepower electric motor, a blacksmith's forge, a school, and a nursery.

Our entire farm has a total of two hundred and ninety people, with more than twenty children under the age of three enrolled in the nursery, fifty-four children attending elementary school, and nine young people attending middle school. Adult members are all participating in spare-time schools, happily studying culture. We often use our days off to hold soccer games and dance parties. Our entire farm is filled with a new atmosphere of labor and joy.

Chairman Mao, all of us members know that our happy life today has been achieved under your leadership and education. When we began to organize the collective farm last year, some members lacked confidence in collective production; they joined the collective farm with a "let's try it" attitude. Over the past year, due to the concentration of land, the unified allocation and use of labor, and the implementation of mechanized farming on some land, production efficiency and yields have greatly increased. Last year, our collective farm harvested an average of 8,900 catties of rice per hectare, while nearby agricultural production cooperatives harvested only 5,305 catties, mutual aid teams only 4,651 catties, and individual farmers harvested the least, only 4,170 catties. This made everyone deeply realize the superiority of the collective farm. Therefore, the members are working with even greater enthusiasm. Last year, each laborer cultivated an average of 2.8 hectares of paddy fields; this year, most of the land is cultivated by mechanical means, and each laborer has increased their area to more than 3 hectares, and still feels that they can do even more.

Chairman Mao, in order to consolidate and develop our collective farm, under the leadership and education of the Party, we are constantly fighting against the peasants' private ownership mentality and conservative ideas. Last September, the People's Government provided loans to help the farm buy forty-four cattle. When discussing how to use and raise these cattle, most members advocated dividing the cattle among the households. They wanted to tie the cattle to their own homes as private property. At that time, the farm chairman, Bai Jinshan, and others were away, and other management committee cadres agreed with this idea. When Bai Jinshan returned home and heard about this, he immediately realized that something was wrong. He first convened a meeting of cadres to unify their thinking, and then convened a meeting of members, pointing out that this practice was inconsistent with the principle of public ownership of the main means of production in the collective farm and that this was the private ownership mentality of the peasants at work. At this time, Party members took the lead in responding to the call, influencing and persuading everyone with their exemplary action of not tying up cattle. Facts have proved that it is much better for the cattle to belong to the collective farm than to individuals. These many cattle belonged to the public, and only two members took care of them. The cattle's farming efficiency was high, they ate well, and they produced more calves. Some members, although having undergone more than a year of collective production, still did not cherish the public tools of the farm and still adopted a liberal attitude towards matters that infringe upon the collective interests of the farm. In order to cultivate the members' collectivist ideas, we often conduct vivid education through specific facts. Cherishing public property has begun to become a new moral standard for all of us members. What should be especially reported to you is that the leadership of the Party branch and the exemplary role of the Party members have played a decisive role in the work of the collective farm. The Party branch secretary, Li Zaigen, the farm chairman, Bai Jinshan, and the production committee member, Sun Houdao, and other three party members, sometimes couldn't eat well or sleep enough in order to study the work of the farm. They are not only able to endure hardship and work hard, but also able to humbly and kindly connect with the masses. Therefore, although our farm is still very young and lacks experience and methods, everyone is full of confidence and believes that the branch will help us solve all difficulties.

Chairman Mao, through the education of our actual lives, we understand even more deeply from the bottom of our hearts that we cannot live without you and the Communist Party. Member Shen Zicheng once held a bowl of steaming rice and said to a working comrade: "This is all brought by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!" Every family hangs your portrait, and everyone feels extremely excited and happy when they see your picture. When we are working, we are filled with new strength as soon as we hear your name. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government rewarded model villages for high yields, and we received medals and certificates, and everyone's production enthusiasm is even higher. We must strengthen our study of politics, culture, and agricultural technology, raise our class consciousness, overcome backward ideas, and make our collective farm more consolidated and developed, and thoroughly realize the great call you have made to "increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers." All of us members have been swept up in a heated patriotic production increase campaign. This year, we strive to produce an average of 11,000 catties of grain per hectare, exceeding the original plan by 1,000 catties.

    星火集体农庄全体庄员
    向毛主席报告集体农庄的伟大成就
    敬爱的毛主席：我们执行你的“组织起来”的伟大指示，已从一九四八年开始成立的仅仅包括四户的互助组，逐渐发展为拥有六十多户庄员的集体农庄。我们这些一无所有的贫苦的农民，现在都变成过着丰衣足食生活的集体农庄庄员了。我们家家吃细粮，每餐都有两三个菜；人人盖着里外三新的被子；我们在劳动时有劳动服，节日有节日的服装；去年有三十七户庄员盖了有玻璃门窗的房子。我们积累了大量的公共财产：四十三台锄草机，二十一台条播机，由一台七马力电动机带动的五台脱谷机，一台打稻头子脱谷机，十三辆大车，九台洋犁，一台制草绳机，六十一头牛，十四口巴克夏猪，十五口本地猪；还有一所由三十匹马力电动机带动四部制米机的制米厂，一个铁匠炉，一所学校和一所托儿所。
    我们全庄共有二百九十个人，有二十多个三岁以下的孩子入了托儿所，五十四个儿童上了小学，九个青年上了中学，成年的庄员都参加了业余学校，高高兴兴地学习文化。我们经常利用休息日举行足球比赛和跳舞晚会。我们全庄充满了劳动、愉快的新气象。
    毛主席，我们全体庄员都知道：我们今天的幸福生活，是在你的领导和教育下取得的。我们在去年开始组织集体农庄时，有些庄员缺乏集体生产的信心，他们抱着“试试看”的态度参加了集体农庄。一年来，由于土地集中、劳力统一调配使用，一部分土地又实行了机械耕作，生产效率和收获量都大大提高了。去年我们集体农庄平均每公顷地收获八千九百斤稻子，而附近的农业生产合作社只收获五千三百零五斤，互助组只收获四千六百五十一斤，单干户最少，仅收获四千一百七十斤。这使大家深刻地认识到集体农庄的优越性。因此，庄员们干活的劲头更高了。去年每个劳动力平均种二点八公顷水田，今年绝大部分土地实行机械作业，每个劳动力增加到三公顷多地，还感到可以作得更多些。
    毛主席，为了巩固和发展我们的集体农庄，我们在党的领导教育下，不断地和农民的私有观念和保守思想进行斗争。去年九月，人民政府贷款帮助农庄买了四十四头牛。在讨论怎样使用和饲养这些耕牛时，大部分庄员主张把牛分给各户。他们想把大牛拴到自己家里，作为私有财产。当时农庄主席白金山等不在，管委会其他干部就同意了这种意见。白金山回家后，听说这件事情，立刻发现不对头。他首先召开干部会议，打通干部思想；然后召开庄员大会，指出这种做法和集体农庄的主要生产资料公有制的原则是不符合的，这是农民私有观念在作祟。这时候，党员带头响应号召，以自己不拴耕牛的模范行动，影响和说服了大家。事实证明，耕牛属于农庄公有比属于个人私有要好得多。这许多耕牛属于公用，只要两个庄员就照顾过来了。耕牛的耕作效率高，吃得也肥，牛犊也下得多。有些庄员虽然经过了一年多的集体生产，但对庄内公有工具还不很爱护，对侵犯农庄集体利益的事情还采取自由主义的态度。为了培养庄员的集体主义的观念，我们经常通过具体事实，进行生动的教育。爱护公共财产已开始成为我们全体庄员新的道德标准。应该特别向你报告的是，党支部的领导和党员的模范作用，在集体农庄的工作中起了决定性的作用。支部书记李在根、农庄主席白金山、生产委员孙厚道等三个党员，为了研究农庄的工作，有时饭都吃不好，觉都睡不足。他们不但能吃苦耐劳，并且能谦虚和蔼地联系群众。因此，我们农庄虽然还很年青，缺乏经验和办法；但大家都充满信心，相信支部会帮助我们解决一切困难。
    毛主席，我们经过实际生活的教育，更加从心眼里懂得离不开你和共产党了。庄员慎自成有一次端着一碗热腾腾的大米饭向工作同志说：“这都是毛主席、共产党带来的呀！”我们每家都挂着您的像片，一看到你的像，大家就感到无比的兴奋和愉快。我们在干活的时候，一听见你的名字，全身就充满了新的力量。最近，中央人民政府农业部奖励丰产模范村，我们得到了奖章和奖状，大家生产情绪更高了。我们要加强政治、文化和农业技术的学习，提高阶级觉悟，克服落后思想，使我们的集体农庄更加巩固发展，彻底实现你所号召的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召。我们全体庄员已卷入了热烈的爱国增产竞赛运动。我们今年争取每公顷地平均产粮一万一千斤，超过原计划一千斤。
