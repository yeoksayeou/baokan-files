Anhui Province has seven special districts, governing a total of seventy counties; in addition, there are five provincial-level cities and three special district-level cities. The province covers an area of ​​over 144,550 square kilometers and has a population of over 30 million. The province is rich in products. In addition to major grains such as rice and wheat, there are also the famous "Keemun Black Tea" and "Tunxi Green Tea." The tobacco and hemp in northern Anhui and the timber in the Dabie Mountains are also well-known throughout the country.

    【新华社合肥二十六日电】安徽省人民政府委员会于八月二十五日召开第一次全体委员会议。到会有安徽省人民政府主席曾希圣、副主席牛树才、黄岩、许杰、沈子修及省人民政府委员会委员共三十七人。列席该会的有省府所属各委、厅、署、院的首长及各民主党派、人民团体、中国人民解放军安徽军区的代表。
    会议首由省人民政府主席曾希圣宣布：遵照中央人民政府委员会第十七次会议的决议，于今日正式成立安徽省人民政府；省人民政府主席、副主席及全体委员于今日就职。同时撤销原皖南人民行政公署、皖北人民行政公署。接着副主席、委员相继讲话，一致表示要在中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导下，大家团结一致，紧密地依靠全省人民，克服一切困难，为建设新安徽而努力。安徽省各界代表也相继讲话，一致祝贺省人民政府的成立，并向省人民政府献旗。会议通过了关于召开安徽省第一届各界人民代表会议及关于成立劳动就业委员会等两项决议；并通过了给中央人民政府毛泽东主席和华东军政委员会饶漱石主席的致敬电。
    安徽地区，在地理上跨长江南北，解放时间又有先后不同，故当时划成皖南、皖北两个行政区。现在两区人民经过三年来的努力，已经奠定了统一发展的基础。
    安徽全省有七个专区，共辖七十个县；另有五个省属市、三个专区属市。全省面积有十四万四千五百五十多平方公里，人口有三千多万。省内物产丰富，除产有稻、麦等主要粮食外，尚有著名中外的“祁门红茶”、“屯溪绿茶”。安徽北部的烟、麻及大别山区的木材等也是全国闻名的。
