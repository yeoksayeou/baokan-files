Engels was the Great Leader and Teacher of the Proletariat
Soviet Union, Sijiepanuowa

Editor's Note: August 5th is the 57th anniversary of the death of Friedrich Engels, the great teacher and leader of the proletariat. To commemorate this great teacher and leader of the proletariat, Stepanova, a Soviet Master of Historical Science, has written this article for our newspaper.

On August 5, 1895, Friedrich Engels, the great friend and comrade-in-arms of Marx, passed away.

Engels' life was a model of selfless dedication to the cause of the proletariat, to the cause of all working people and the oppressed.

Marx and Engels were the founders of scientific socialism. Marx and Engels discovered the laws of development of capitalist society; they scientifically demonstrated that the development of capitalist society and its internal class struggle would inevitably lead capitalism to its death and lead a new society without any exploitation or oppression of man to victory.

Marx and Engels proved that the creator of the new, classless society is the most advanced class in capitalist society - the proletariat, which must unite all working people and the oppressed around itself and lead them to strike against capitalism.

Marx and Engels taught that only through violent proletarian revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat could capitalism be eliminated and a classless communist society be built. The doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the main doctrine of Marxism.

Marx and Engels taught that in order to defeat the old society and create a new, classless society, the proletariat must have its own workers' party, the Communist Party.

The great theories of Marx and Engels, which were elevated to a new and higher stage by their brilliant successors, Lenin and Stalin, have gloriously withstood countless attacks and trials by the enemy. This doctrine is "omnipotent because it is correct." (Lenin: "The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism")

Friedrich Engels was born on November 28, 1820, in Barmen, in the Prussian Rhine Province, to the family of a textile factory owner. Even as a teenager, Engels saw the poor lives and overwhelming labor of the workers. He had deep sympathy for the working class and hatred for their oppressors. Later, when he stayed in England, the most developed capitalist country at the time, Engels studied the life and struggle of the English workers and concluded that the proletariat was not only the most oppressed class, but also the most advanced class in modern society. Young Engels, filled with will and courage, broke away from the environment he came from and dedicated all his strength and talents to serving the proletariat.

In the noble cause of serving the proletariat, Engels' friendship with the great Marx arose and developed. "There are many very moving stories of friendship in ancient legends. The European proletariat has the right to say that its science was created by two scholars and warriors, whose relationship with each other surpassed all the most moving friendship stories in ancient legends." (Lenin: "Friedrich Engels")

Engels often emphasized that he played a "supporting role" in creating the proletarian revolutionary theory, and that the main credit for this great cause belonged to Marx. Engels wrote: "Marx stood higher, saw farther, and observed more, and faster, than all of us...". "Without him, our theory would be far from what it is now. Therefore, it is just that this theory is called by his name." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 2, p. 366, 1948 edition)

However, Engels' personal contribution to the creation of Marxist theory was truly enormous. In many works co-authored with Marx ("The German Ideology" and "The Communist Manifesto," etc.) and in his own works ("The Condition of the Working Class in England," "The German Peasant War," "Anti-Dühring," "Dialectics of Nature," "The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State," etc.), Engels created and developed scientific socialism—the strongest weapon of the proletariat.

After Marx's death (1883), Engels took on the task of completing the publication of "Das Kapital." In Marx's lifetime, only the first volume of "Das Kapital" was published in 1867. As for the second and third volumes, Marx did not have time to finish them. Engels took on the work of organizing and publishing them. The second volume of "Das Kapital" was published in 1885, and the third volume was published in 1894. Lenin wrote: "These two volumes of 'Das Kapital' are indeed works created jointly by Marx and Engels."

The characteristic of Engels as a scientist was his amazing multifaceted and rich knowledge. Political economy and philosophy, natural science and history—Engels studied these sciences and, together with Marx, carried out real transformations, real revolutions, in these sciences.

Engels was not only a scientist, but also a revolutionary, a leader of the proletariat, and a passionate defender of all working people and the oppressed.

During the revolutionary period of 1848-1849, Engels and Marx fought for the establishment of a unified democratic German republic. In the spring of 1849, an armed uprising broke out in southwestern Germany. Engels participated in the insurgent army and fought the Prussian army several times. Marx's daughter, Eleanor, wrote about Engels: "All those who saw him on the battlefield were still talking about his extraordinary calmness and complete contempt for all dangers long afterward."

Engels, like Marx, was a passionate fighter against all national oppression. In some of his articles, he exposed the baseness and cruelty of British colonial policy in India and China. In an article written to commemorate the armed uprising of the Indian militia, Engels directly rebuked the British ruling class with angry and passionate words, writing: "The Kalmyk hordes of Genghis Khan and Timur, who raided cities like a black swarm of locusts and ate up everything they encountered on their way, may be a benefit to the country compared with the soldiers of the Christian, civilized, and chivalrous British Empire." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 2, Chapter 1, p. 324)

Since the time these articles were written, the "civilization" of the bourgeoisie has increasingly exposed its barbaric nature. The monstrous crimes committed by the American imperialist cannibals in Korea are proof.

While Engels angrily exposed the barbarity of capitalist robbers, he also warmly celebrated the struggles of the Asian people against foreign oppressors. In an article written to commemorate China's Second Opium War, Engels celebrated the increased resistance of the Chinese people to foreign aggression. He happily pointed out: "The masses are actively and enthusiastically participating in the struggle against foreigners." (Ibid., p. 165) In the struggle of the Chinese people for freedom and national independence, Engels saw the dawn of a new century for the whole of Asia.

In the proletariat, as the gravedigger of capitalism and the creator of a new socialist society, Engels discovered the power to eliminate national oppression and all economic and political oppression forever.

To educate the proletariat and help them prepare to strike against capitalism—Engels regarded this as the main task of his life.

Together with Marx, Engels carried out an unremitting struggle to establish the political party of the proletariat and to free the proletariat from the influence of the bourgeois ideology that ran counter to its interests.

The activities of Marx and Engels in the Communist League (1847-1852) and in the First International (1864-1872), and their struggle against opportunism in the socialist parties of various countries—these were all stages in the development of the struggle for the proletarian party.

After Marx's death, Engels alone took on the full burden of leading the international workers' movement.

"After Marx's death, Engels alone continued to bear the role of advisor and guide to the socialists in Europe. Whether it was the German socialists, whose strength was still growing rapidly despite government oppression, or the socialists in backward countries who still had to carefully consider their initial actions, such as the socialists in Spain, Romania, and Russia, they all sought advice and guidance from Engels. They all received instructions from the rich knowledge and experience treasure trove of the old Engels." (Lenin: "Friedrich Engels")

Engels watched with great sympathy the struggle of the Russian revolutionaries against the Tsarist system and against the oppression of landlords. He presciently pointed out that the Russian revolution played a turning point in world history. Engels hoped that he would be able to "see the twentieth century" and live to see the Russian revolution. But Engels' long-cherished wish was not realized.

In the year of Engels' death, the young Lenin founded the "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class" in St. Petersburg—this was the initial budding of a revolutionary proletarian party in Russia. It was at this time that Comrade Stalin began his revolutionary path in the South Caucasus.

Lenin and Stalin not only defended the great theories of Marx and Engels in an irreconcilable struggle against the opportunists of the Second International, but also developed and enriched this theory and raised it to an unprecedented height.

Comrade Stalin, the brilliant successor of the cause of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, taught people to understand that Marxism is a living, creative, and developing doctrine. Comrade Stalin wrote: "Marxism is the science of the laws of development of nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, and the science of the construction of communist society. This science of Marxism cannot stand still—it is developing and improving. In its development, Marxism cannot but be enriched by new experience and new knowledge—therefore, its individual formulas and conclusions cannot but change with time and cannot but be replaced by new formulas and conclusions adapted to new historical tasks. Marxism does not recognize immutable conclusions and formulas that are absolutely adapted to all eras and periods. Marxism is the enemy of all dogmatism." (Stalin: "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics")

History is giving increasing proof of the power and vitality of the great creative theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Following the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries have embarked on the path indicated by the brilliant teachers and leaders of the proletariat. The Chinese people have achieved a great victory of world historical significance. In the colonial countries, the national liberation movement is expanding. The Communist Party, fighting under the great banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, is developing and consolidating in all countries of the world.

No matter what means the imperialists and their right-wing socialist lackeys use to try to save the decadent capitalist society, no matter how hard they try to "eliminate Marxism," the great, invincible theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin is completing its worldwide triumphant march.

    恩格斯是无产阶级的伟大领袖和导师
    苏联  斯杰潘诺娃
    编者按：八月五日是弗里德利赫·恩格斯逝世五十七周年，为了纪念这位无产阶级的伟大导师和领袖，苏联历史科学硕士斯杰潘诺娃特为本报撰写了这篇文章。
    一八九五年八月五日，伟大的马克思的朋友和战友弗里德利赫·恩格斯与世长辞了。
    恩格斯的一生是为无产阶级事业、为一切劳动人民和被压迫者的事业而舍己献身的典范。
    马克思和恩格斯是科学社会主义的创始人。马克思和恩格斯发现了资本主义社会的发展规律；科学地论证了资本主义社会的发展及其内部的阶级斗争，必不可免地要引导资本主义走向死亡，引导没有任何人剥削人和任何压迫的新社会走向胜利。
    马克思和恩格斯证明了崭新的、没有阶级的社会的创造者是资本主义社会最先进的阶级——无产阶级，这个阶级必须把一切劳动人民和被压迫者团结在自己的周围，并引导他们对资本主义实行冲击。
    马克思和恩格斯教导说，只有用强力的无产阶级革命和建立无产阶级专政的方法，才能消灭资本主义和建成没有阶级的共产主义社会。无产阶级专政的学说是马克思主义的主要学说。
    马克思和恩格斯教导说，为了战胜旧社会和创造新的、没有阶级的社会，无产阶级必须有自己的工人党、共产党。
    被他们的天才继承者——列宁、斯大林提升到新的、更高阶段的马克思和恩格斯的伟大学说，光荣地经受住敌人的无数次攻击和无数次考验。这个学说之所以“万能，就是因为它正确”。（列宁：“马克思主义底三个来源与三个组成部分”）
    ×    ×    ×
    弗里德利赫·恩格斯于一八二○年十一月二十八日诞生在普鲁士莱茵省巴门城的一个纺织厂主的家庭里。还在少年时代，恩格斯看到工人的贫困生活和力不胜任的劳动，他就深怀着对劳动阶级的同情，和对他们的压迫者的憎恨。后来，当他逗留在当时资本主义最发达的国家——英国的时候，恩格斯研究了英国工人的生活和斗争，并得出结论：无产阶级不但是最受压迫的阶级，而且是现代社会的最先进的阶级。年青的恩格斯充沛着意志和果敢的力量，和他出身的环境断绝关系，并贡献出自己的一切力量和全部才能为无产阶级服务。
    在为无产阶级服务的崇高事业中，恩格斯与伟大的马克思发生和发展了友谊。“古谭中有许多非常动人的友谊故事。欧洲无产阶级有权说，它的科学是由两位学者兼战士创造成的，这两个人相互间的关系超过了一切古谭中最令人感动的友谊的故事。”（列宁：“弗里德利赫·恩格斯”）
    恩格斯常常强调说，在创造无产阶级革命学说上，他演的是“配角”，在这个伟大事业上的主要功绩是属于马克思的。恩格斯写道：“马克思比我们所有的人都站得更高、看得更远并观察得更多、更快……。”“没有他，我们的学说远不能像现在所有的这样。因此，这个学说叫作他的名字是公正的。”（马克思、恩格斯选集第二卷，第三六六页，一九四八年版）
    然而恩格斯在创造马克思学说中的个人贡献实在是巨大的。恩格斯在和马克思合作写成的许多著作（“德意志意识形态”和“共产党宣言”等）中以及在自己的著作（“英国工人阶级底状况”、“德国农民战争”、“反杜林论”、“自然辩证法”、“家族、私有财产及国家的起源”等）中，创造了并发展了科学社会主义——无产阶级的最坚强的武器。
    马克思逝世（一八八三年）后，恩格斯担起了完成出版“资本论”的工作。在马克思生前一八六七年的时候，只出版了“资本论”第一卷，至于第二卷和第三卷，马克思没有来得及整理完毕。恩格斯负起了整理的工作并把它出版了。在一八八五年出版了“资本论”第二卷，在一八九四年出版了第三卷。列宁写道：“这两卷‘资本论’确实是马克思和恩格斯合力作成的著作。”
    作为科学家的恩格斯的特点，是他那令人惊奇的多方面的丰富知识。政治经济学和哲学，自然科学和历史学——恩格斯对这些科学都作过研究，并在这些科学中和马克思一起进行了真正的变革，真正的革命。
    恩格斯不仅是一位科学家，而且是一位革命家，无产阶级的领袖，一切劳动人民和被压迫者的热烈保卫者。
    在一八四八——一八四九年的革命时期，恩格斯和马克思曾为建立统一的民主德意志共和国而进行了斗争。一八四九年春，在德国西南部爆发了武装起义，恩格斯曾参加起义军，并对普鲁士军队作过几次战。马克思的女儿艾利奥诺拉在论到恩格斯时曾写道：“所有在战场上看见过他的人们，在日后很久还在谈述着他那种异常沉着的态度，和对一切危险的完全蔑视的态度。”
    恩格斯和马克思一样，是反对一切民族压迫的热烈战士。他在自己所写的某些论文中，揭露了英国在印度和在中国的殖民政策的卑鄙性和残忍性。在为纪念印度民兵武装起义而写的论文中，恩格斯以充满愤怒和激昂的言语直接斥责了英国统治阶级，他写道：“那些类似一片黑色的蝗虫对城市猛袭，并吃光他们在道途上所遇到的一切的成吉思汗和帖木尔的加尔木克寇群，若和基督教的、文明的、骑士的不列颠帝国的士兵们比较起来，他们或许是对国家的善行。”（马克思、恩格斯选集第二卷，第一章，第三二四页）
    从写了这些文章的那时起，资产阶级的“文明”越来越暴露了它的野蛮本质。美帝国主义吃人者在朝鲜所干下的骇人听闻的滔天罪行就是证明。
    恩格斯愤怒地揭露了资本主义强盗的野蛮性，同时热烈地庆贺亚洲人民反对外国压迫者的斗争。在为纪念中国第二次鸦片战争而写的论文中，恩格斯庆贺中国人民对外国人侵略的反抗的增强，他愉快地指出：“民众是积极地而且是狂热地参加反对外人的斗争。”（同卷，第一六五页）在中国人民为争取自由和祖国独立的斗争中，恩格斯看到了这是全亚洲的新世纪的曙光。
    在作为资本主义的掘墓人和新的社会主义社会的创造者的无产阶级身上，恩格斯发现了永远消灭民族压迫和一切经济与政治压迫的力量。
    教育无产阶级，帮助他们准备对资本主义实行冲击——恩格斯把这看作是自己一生的主要任务。
    和马克思一起，恩格斯为创立无产阶级的政党，为使无产阶级摆脱与自己背道而驰的资产阶级思想体系的影响，进行了不倦的斗争。
    马克思和恩格斯在共产主义同盟（一八四七——一八五二年）和在第一国际（一八六四——一八七二年）的活动，和他们反对各国社会主义政党中的机会主义的斗争——这些都是为无产阶级政党而斗争的发展阶段。
    马克思逝世后，恩格斯单独地负起了领导国际工人运动的全部重担。
    “马克思逝世以后，恩格斯单独继续担负着欧洲社会主义者底顾问与指导者的作用。无论是虽受政府压迫，但力量仍不断迅速增长的德国社会主义者，或是落后国家内那些还须仔细考虑斟酌其初步动作的社会主义者，如西班牙，罗马尼亚和俄国的社会主义者，都同样向恩格斯征求过意见，请求过指导。他们都从年老恩格斯底丰富知识与经验宝库中领到过指示。”（列宁：“弗里德利赫·恩格斯”）
    恩格斯怀着巨大的同情心注视反对沙皇制度、反对地主压迫的俄国革命者的斗争。他预见地指出了俄国革命在世界历史中是起着转捩点的作用的。恩格斯希望他能够“看一看二十世纪”，并活到俄国革命的时候。可是恩格斯的这个宿愿没有得到实现。
    ×    ×    ×
    在恩格斯逝世的那一年，年轻的列宁在彼得堡创立了“工人阶级解放斗争协会”——这是俄国国内的革命无产阶级政党的最初萌芽。就在这时，斯大林同志开始在南高加索走上了他的革命道路。
    列宁、斯大林不仅在和第二国际的机会主义者进行不调和的斗争中捍卫了马克思和恩格斯的伟大学说，而且发展和丰富了这个学说，并把它提到前所未有的高度。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁事业的天才继承者斯大林同志教导人们要了解马克思主义是活的、创造的、发展的学说。斯大林同志写道：“马克思主义是关于自然和社会底发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，是关于共产主义社会建设的科学。马克思主义这一科学是不能停滞不前的，——它是在发展着和改进着。马克思主义在自己的发展中不能不以新的经验、新的知识而丰富起来，——因而它的个别公式和结论不能不随着时间而改变，不能不被适应于新的历史任务的新的公式和结论所代替。马克思主义不承认绝对适应于一切时代和时期的不变的结论和公式。马克思主义是一切教条主义的敌人。”（斯大林：“马克思主义与语言学问题”）
    历史正给马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大创造性学说的力量和生命力，带来日益增多的证明。跟随着苏联，各人民民主国家已走上了无产阶级天才导师和领袖所指示的道路。中国人民已取得了具有世界历史意义的伟大胜利。在各殖民地国家，民族解放运动正在扩展。在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大旗帜下斗争着的共产党，正在世界所有国家里发展着和巩固着。
    尽管帝国主义者和他们的右翼社会党的走狗们用什么手段企图挽救腐朽的资本主义社会，尽管他们怎样处心积虑地来“消灭马克思主义”，然而马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大的、不可战胜的学说正在完成着自己的全世界凯旋行进。
