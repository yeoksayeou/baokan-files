Report on Launching the Patriotic Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
(Summary of the Report at the First Session of the Fourth Beijing Municipal People's Congress on August 11, 1952)
Liu Ren, Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government

Since Chairman Mao called for "Increase Production, Practice Economy" last year, the people of our city, especially the broad masses of workers, have actively responded. The victory of the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements has laid a solid foundation for carrying out the patriotic increase production and practice economy campaign. Now, the workers, peasants, and private industrialists and businessmen of our city should be further mobilized to launch a patriotic increase production and practice economy campaign in state-owned industry, private industry, and agriculture.

I. Launch a Comprehensive Patriotic Increase Production and Practice Economy Competition Campaign in State-Owned Factories, Mines, and Enterprises

The total output value of Beijing's state-owned industry increased by 169 percent last year compared to 1950. This year, in addition to completing the state production plan, which is 32 percent higher than in 1951, we are also required to strive to increase production and practice economy by 800 billion yuan for the state.

To accomplish this enormous task, the current central task is to summarize and vigorously promote advanced experiences, and especially to strive to learn from and promote advanced Soviet experiences. Recently, relying on the high patriotic labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff, we have summarized and promoted some important advanced experiences. The summarization and promotion of these advanced experiences has not only improved technology, greatly increased production efficiency, and reduced costs, but has also greatly encouraged the creative labor enthusiasm of workers and staff, and rapidly changed and is changing the face of factories. For example, the successful trial burning of low-quality coal by the Shijingshan Power Plant reduced fuel costs by 41 percent. The success of the Qinghe Woolen Mill's fine spinning workshop in focusing on learning the Hao Jianxiu work method increased the number of spindles managed by each person by 100 to 200 percent, demonstrating that the Hao Jianxiu work method can be promoted not only in cotton spinning but also in wool spinning. The Changxindian Railway Factory promoted the double-handed electric welding method, increasing production efficiency by more than 100 percent. Jin Zhaoying, an apprentice at the Branch Factory of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, created a set of rhythmic operating methods for simultaneously using both hands, which not only increased the efficiency of turning "pressure mothers" by 108 percent, but also sparked a surge in the worker masses learning advanced experiences and finding "tricks." Huang Runping of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory created a new warehouse management method, which not only changed the past situation of blind supply, making the warehouse actively serve production and workshops, but also eloquently proved that the view that it is impossible for management personnel to find advanced experiences is extremely wrong.

However, we still have many shortcomings in summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, the most important of which is that the leadership is not thorough, remaining at the level of general meetings, calls, and propaganda, while neglecting to carry out detailed organizational work and effectively solve specific problems in the work. This shortcoming must be quickly corrected. In promoting advanced experiences, typical experiments should first be organized in order to learn from experience and play a demonstrative role; after the experiment is successful, specific promotion plans and steps should be formulated and universally implemented, with deadlines for achieving results, and regular inspections should be carried out to ensure the realization of the plan. In summarizing advanced experiences, it is necessary to rely on the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, learn from each other's strengths, and summarize and improve them into systematic operating methods. At the same time, we should also launch a rationalization proposal campaign, give full play to the initiative and creativity of workers and staff, solve problems in production and management, and thus discover, summarize, and promote advanced experiences. Whether summarizing and promoting advanced experiences or launching rationalization proposals, it should be based on the specific situation of the unit, focusing on solving key and common problems. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the above work, the following should be done: First, the leadership should be responsible, take personal action, study the advanced achievements of the masses at any time, and summarize and promote them in a timely manner; second, organize technical personnel to go deep into the workshops to guide workers in solving technical problems, so that the scientific knowledge of technical personnel and the practical experience of workers are combined to give play to the active role of technical personnel in improving production and improving technology. Third, establish and improve specialized organizational structures for leaders to summarize and promote advanced experiences, and equip them with capable full-time cadres. The first is that the leadership should grasp this work tightly.

The patriotic increase production and practice economy competition campaign is a production reform movement. In the movement, there will inevitably be fierce ideological struggles, and this struggle is mainly between advanced and backward ideas, especially conservative ideas. We must be good at using vivid and concrete facts to carry out education, overcome the conservative ideas of workers and staff, especially some management personnel and technical personnel, combine the exemplary deeds of advanced producers and labor models, publicize the great role of promoting advanced experience in improving and improving production, and combine production achievements to publicize the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy for building a great motherland and strengthening national defense.

Fully mobilizing the masses of workers and staff to formulate advanced increase production and practice economy competition plans is an important task for the successful launch of the competition movement. We require that the plan truly be able to explore, promote, and concentrate the initiative and creativity of the broad masses of workers, and be grasped by the masses.

In the increase production and practice economy competition movement, we must pay full attention to ensuring the required quality, and should pay attention to preventing the bias of simply pursuing quantity and neglecting quality. At the same time, we must pay attention to continuously improving safety equipment, giving equal attention to safety and production, and should prevent and correct the phenomenon of increasing accidents or harming workers' health due to competition.

For all workers and staff who have made achievements and contributions, they must be given timely rewards and commendations according to the size of their achievements and contributions. And in the process of implementing rewards, gradually improve the reward system. At the same time, we must further improve environmental sanitation, protect the health of workers and staff, and effectively solve the necessary welfare of workers and staff. We are now planning to build a large-scale sanatorium for workers and staff, and strive to basically solve the housing problem of workers and staff within two or three years.

With the development of the patriotic increase production and practice economy competition movement, problems and shortcomings in enterprise management will be further exposed, requiring us to further improve business management. Therefore, in the second half of this year, we will conduct assessment work in workshops and teams in a planned way, and establish a workshop cost system in the main workshops of qualified industrial and mining enterprises, laying the foundation for implementing the economic accounting system. In factories with poorer conditions, we should focus on establishing various necessary systems, such as recording and statistics systems, to create conditions for implementing the economic accounting system. The main leading cadres of each factory, mine, and enterprise must go deep into the workshops, study their work, and promptly discover and solve the problems and shortcomings existing in production. The factory director or manager of each factory, mine, and enterprise must personally take action to do a good job in the work of one workshop, summarize typical experiences, and guide the entire factory.

II. Launch an Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in Private Industry

Beijing's private industry also had great development last year. Compared with 1950, the number of households increased by 40 percent, the number of employees increased by 30 percent, and the total output value increased by 134 percent. Some industries with great speculative nature have gradually been eliminated or declined after the "Five-Anti" movement. The production of other private industries also declined temporarily during the "Five-Anti" movement. After the People's Government vigorously supported and the workers actively united with the capitalists to negotiate and do a good job in production, now, except for the speculative and backward ones, the private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have generally basically restored production, and some have had new development.

Therefore, the central link in launching the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement in private industry is to improve technical equipment, improve quality, and reduce costs. In factories and workshops with raw materials and sales channels, we should strive to increase production at the same time. All private industries must strive to improve business management, face the broad masses of working people in urban and rural areas, vigorously open up sales channels, that is, produce for them, and overcome the idea of simply relying on state support. All private industrialists should also fully realize that the key to launching the patriotic increase production and practice economy movement is to fully exert and rely on the initiative and creativity of the masses of workers and staff under the principle of labor-capital benefit; the workers and staff in private enterprises must also realize that doing a good job in production and business is beneficial not only to the capitalists but also to the country and the workers. This requires timely convening labor-capital consultation meetings, signing production contracts, solving problems existing in production, and, on the basis of increasing production and practicing economy, further implementing the policy of labor-capital benefit, appropriately solving the living and welfare problems of workers and staff, and giving rewards to workers and staff who have made achievements in improving or improving production.

III. Launch a Patriotic Bumper Harvest Movement in Agriculture

Agricultural production in 1951 achieved great results, with a total output increase of 15.3 percent compared to 1950. This year, we want to launch a patriotic bumper harvest movement, increase the yield per unit area, and strive to increase the total output by 10 percent compared to 1951 despite the reduction of cultivated land area due to the development of urban construction.

Organizing is the fundamental way to develop agricultural production. This year, we require that 70 percent of the farmers with labor are organized. In areas that have not yet been organized, we must vigorously develop seasonal or temporary mutual aid teams; in places with existing mutual aid foundations, we must continue to consolidate and develop year-round mutual aid teams that combine agriculture and sideline occupations. Each district should focus on strengthening the leadership of existing agricultural production cooperatives, systematically and conscientiously summarize experiences, and lay a favorable foundation for further developing agricultural production cooperatives next year. This autumn, we should combine the autumn harvest with seed selection, evaluate production achievements, elect bumper harvest households, bumper harvest teams, bumper harvest villages, and labor models from the bottom up, convene agricultural labor model conferences, establish bumper harvest banners, and summarize and promote advanced bumper harvest experiences. State-owned farms must give full play to their demonstrative role and ensure a yield of 800 to 1,000 catties of bumper harvest cotton per mu, 350 to 400 catties of dryland cotton per mu, and 1,600 catties of rice per mu. Cadres leading agricultural production should actively establish close contact with agricultural scientific research institutions, schools, and state-owned farms, absorb advanced agricultural production technologies and experiences, and guide agricultural production in combination with specific circumstances.

We believe that relying on the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and relying on the unlimited enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people, especially the broad masses of workers, we will surely be able to successfully complete this year's task of increasing production and practicing economy.

    关于开展爱国增产节约运动的报告
    （一九五二年八月十一日在北京市第四届第一次各界人民代表会议上的报告摘要）
    北京市人民政府财政经济委员会副主任　刘仁
    自从去年毛主席号召“增加生产、厉行节约”以来，我们全市人民、特别是广大的工人群众，就纷纷起来热烈响应。伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动的胜利，又给开展爱国增产节约运动奠定了坚实的基础。现在我们全市的工人、农民和私营工商业者应该进一步动员起来，开展国营工业、私营工业和农业的爱国增产节约运动。
    一、全面开展国营工厂、矿山、企业的爱国增产节约竞赛
    运动
    北京市的国营工业，去年全年生产总值比一九五零年增加了百分之一百六十九。今年我们要求除完成比一九五一年增产百分之三十二的国家生产计划外，争取再为国家增产节约八千亿元。
    要完成这个巨大的任务，目前的中心工作是总结与大力推广先进经验，特别要努力学习与推广苏联的先进经验。最近这一时期，依靠广大职工群众的高度的爱国主义劳动热情，我们已经总结与推广了一些重要的先进经验。这些先进经验的总结与推广，不但改进了技术，大大地提高了生产效率，降低了成本，而且极大地鼓舞了职工的创造性的劳动热情，迅速地改变了和改变着工厂的面貌。例如石景山发电厂试烧劣质煤成功，即降低了燃料成本百分之四十一。清河制呢厂细纱间重点学习郝建秀工作法成功，每个人管理纱锭的数量，增加了百分之百至百分之二百，说明了郝建秀工作法不但可在棉纺中而且可在毛纺中推广。长辛店铁路工厂推广双手电焊法，提高生产效率一倍以上。华北农业机械厂一分厂学徒金兆瑛创造了一套两手同时动作的有规律的操作方法，不但使镟“压母”的效率提高了百分之一百零八，而且带动了工人群众学习先进经验、找“窍门”的热潮。华北农业机械总厂黄润萍创造了新的仓库管理法，不但改变了过去盲目供应的状况，使仓库主动为生产为车间服务，而且雄辩地证明了那种以为管理人员不可能找到先进经验的看法，是极端错误的。
    但是，在总结、推广先进经验上，我们还存在着不少缺点，其中最主要的是领导不深入，停留在一般的开会、号召和宣传，而忽视进行细致的组织工作和切实解决工作中的具体问题。这种缺点必须迅速改正。在推广先进经验上，应该首先组织典型试验，以便吸取经验，发挥示范作用；在试验成功以后，即应拟定具体的推广计划和步骤，普遍推行，限期作出成绩来，并经常进行检查，保证计划的实现。在总结先进经验上，必须依靠群众来进行，集中群众智慧，取长补短，总结、提高成为系统的操作方法。同时，我们还应开展合理化建议运动，高度发挥职工的积极性和创造性，解决生产和管理上的问题，从而发现、总结与推广先进经验。无论总结、推广先进经验，或者开展合理化建议，都应根据本单位的具体情况，围绕着解决带有关键性、普遍性的问题来进行。为了保证以上工作的顺利进行，应该做到：第一、领导负责，亲自动手，随时研究群众的先进的成就，及时总结、推广；第二、组织技术人员深入车间，指导工人解决技术问题，使技术人员的科学知识和工人的实际经验结合起来，发挥技术人员在改进生产、提高技术上的积极作用。第三、建立与健全领导总结、推广先进经验的专门组织机构，并配备得力的专职干部。首先是要领导上抓紧此项工作。
    爱国增产节约竞赛运动是一个生产改革运动，在运动中必然会发生激烈的思想斗争，这种斗争主要是先进思想与落后思想特别是与保守思想的斗争。我们必须善于利用生动具体的事实进行教育，克服职工特别是若干管理人员和技术人员中的保守思想，结合先进生产者、劳动模范的模范事迹，宣传推广先进经验对改进、提高生产的伟大作用，并结合生产上的成绩，宣传增产节约对于建设伟大祖国、增强国防的伟大意义。
    充分发动职工群众，订立先进的增产节约竞赛计划，是胜利开展竞赛运动的重要工作。我们要求计划真正能发掘、发扬、集中广大工人群众的积极性和创造性，并为群众所掌握。
    在增产节约竞赛运动中，必须充分注意保证应有的质量，应该注意防止单纯追求数量、忽视质量的偏向。必须同时注意不断改善安全设备，把安全与生产予以同等的注意，应防止与纠正因竞赛而增加事故或损伤工人健康的现象。
    对于一切有成绩、有贡献的职工，必须按其成绩与贡献的大小，及时给予奖励和表扬。并在实施奖励的过程中，逐步使奖励制度健全起来。同时，我们还要进一步改善环境卫生，保护职工的健康，并切实解决必不可少的职工福利。现在我们正计划修建较大规模的职工疗养院，并争取在两、三年内基本解决职工的住房问题。
    随着爱国增产节约竞赛运动的开展，将会进一步暴露企业管理工作中的问题和缺点，要求我们进一步改进经营管理。因此，今年下半年内，我们要有计划地在车间与小组中进行查定工作，并在有条件的工矿、企业的主要车间建立车间成本制度，打下实行经济核算制的基础。而在条件较差的工厂中，则应着重建立各种必要的制度，如记录统计制度等，为实行经济核算制创造条件。各个厂矿、企业的主要领导干部必须深入车间，钻研业务，及时发现与解决生产中存在的问题和缺点。各厂矿、企业的厂长或经理，必须亲自动手，搞好一个车间的工作，总结典型经验，指导全厂。
    二、开展私营工业的增产节约运动
    北京市的私营工业去年也有很大的发展，如与一九五零年比较起来，户数增加了百分之四十，职工人数增加了百分之三十，生产总值增加了百分之一百三十四。有些带着很大投机性的工业，在“五反”后已经逐渐被淘汰或没落，其他的私营工业生产在“五反”运动期间，也曾经受到暂时的影响而下降，经过人民政府大力扶植和职工主动团结资本家协商搞好生产后，现在除了投机的、落后的以外，有利国计民生的私营工业，一般已经基本恢复了生产，有些已经有了新的发展。
    因此，在私营工业中开展爱国增产节约运动的中心环节，是改进技术设备，提高质量，降低成本，在有原料、有销路的工厂作坊中，并应力求同时增加产量。一切私营工业均须努力改善经营管理，面向城乡广大劳动人民，大力打开销路，即为他们而生产，克服单纯依靠国家扶植的思想。一切私营工业家并应充分认识，开展爱国增产节约运动的关键，是在劳资两利的原则下充分发挥与依靠职工群众的积极性和创造性；在私营企业中的职工，也必须认识到搞好生产和业务不但对资本家而且对国家、对工人都是有利的。这就必须及时召开劳资协商会议，签订生产合同，解决生产中存在的问题，并在增产节约的基础上，进一步贯彻劳资两利政策，适当地解决职工的生活福利问题，并对改进或提高生产有成绩的职工，给予奖励。
    三、开展农业的爱国丰产运动
    一九五一年的农业生产获得了很大的成绩，总产量比一九五零年提高了百分之十五点三。今年我们要开展爱国丰产运动，提高单位面积产量，争取在耕地面积因都市建设的发展而减少的情况下，总产量仍比一九五一年增加百分之十。
    组织起来是发展农业生产的根本道路。今年我们要求把有劳动力的农民百分之七十组织起来。在尚未组织起来的地区，要大力发展季节性或临时性的互助组；在已有互助基础的地方，要继续巩固和发展常年的农业、副业相结合的互助组。各区应抓紧对现有的农业生产合作社的领导，系统地认真总结经验，为明年进一步发展农业生产合作社奠定有利的基础。今年秋季应结合秋收选种，评比生产成绩，自下而上地选举丰产户、丰产组、丰产村和劳动模范，召开农业劳动模范大会，树立丰产旗帜，并总结与推广先进丰产经验。国营农场必须充分发挥示范作用，保证丰产棉花每亩产量八百斤至一千斤，旱地棉花每亩产量三百五十斤至四百斤，水稻每亩产量一千六百斤。领导农业生产的干部，要主动与农业科学研究机关、学校和国营农场取得密切联系，吸取先进的农业生产技术、经验，结合具体情况，指导农业生产。
    我们相信，依靠毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导，依靠广大人民群众特别是广大的工人群众的无限的积极性和创造性，我们一定能够胜利完成今年的增产节约的任务。
