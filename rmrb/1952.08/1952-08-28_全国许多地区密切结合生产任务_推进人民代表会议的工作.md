Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: In order to better mobilize the masses and carry out economic construction, many regions across the country are further promoting the work of the People's Representative Conferences. Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, Fujian, Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Shaanxi provinces all held civil affairs conferences in July and August. Gansu, Ningxia and other provinces are conveying and implementing the resolutions of the Northwest Civil Affairs Conference. Xinjiang convened a commissioner and county head conference in August, Anhui is holding a civil affairs conference, and Shaanxi, Suiyuan and other provinces are preparing to convene county head conferences. Henan, Shaanxi and other provinces are instructing some prefectures and counties to inspect the work of the People's Representative Conferences.

The central link in promoting the work of People's Representative Conferences in various regions lies in further integrating the People's Representative Conferences closely with various central tasks, especially with production work, so as to form a regular and consolidated system. In the past, the error of opposing democratic political construction work to central work had been criticized, but this error still exists in some prefectures and counties. For example, this spring, the Nantong Prefecture of Northern Jiangsu mechanically disapproved the convening of People's Representative Conferences in Qidong, Rugao and other counties due to "busy production work," preventing these counties from better mobilizing the masses to do a good job in production work. Although some counties in Shandong convened People's Representative Conferences, they were not closely integrated with the central tasks, so their effect was not significant. In prefectures and counties where the work of the People's Representative Conference is not well done, the former error is still the main one. When work is busy, they neglect to discuss the current major affairs of the people through the People's Representative Conference, which is the main reason why the People's Representative Conference cannot form a system. In order to solve this problem, in summarizing and inspecting the work, various regions have emphasized the inseparable relationship between central work and the People's Representative Conference. Fujian Province proposed that strengthening democratic political construction work is currently to ensure the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, develop industrial and agricultural production, and meet large-scale economic and cultural construction. Shandong Province stipulates that the county People's Representative Conference should be held two to four times a year. One session should be held before spring plowing, with the central topic being the implementation of the annual production tasks; one session should be held after the autumn harvest, with the central topic being to summarize the annual production, promote the exchange of materials, and implement winter work. These two meetings must be held regularly. A session should also be held around the summer harvest to discuss the current production work, and temporary People's Representative Conferences may be convened if there are urgent tasks. This unified arrangement that closely integrates production will enrich the content of the People's Representative Conference and become the best guarantee for forming a system.

In order to fully exert the power of the people to exercise state power, many regions across the country have formulated specific plans to quickly enable the People's Representative Conference to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elect the People's Government. Hebei and Fujian stipulated that the county and city People's Representative Conferences will all exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress in the second half of this year. Shandong decided that the county People's Representative Conference will exercise half of its functions and powers this year and all of them next spring, while the city will exercise all of them this year. Northern Jiangsu and Shaanxi decided that the county and city will exercise part of their functions and powers this year and all of them next year. They all believe that after three years of various movements, the consciousness and organization of the masses have been greatly improved. Allowing the People's Representative Conference to elect the People's Government will make democracy more developed and make it easier for the People's Government to lead the people in various tasks.

Various regions have also paid attention to strengthening the work of grassroots political power. The Suiyuan Provincial Civil Affairs Conference resolved that this winter and next spring, in conjunction with the land reform review, we will further mobilize the masses, hold village People's Representative Conferences, and elect village People's Governments, so as to make the grassroots political power organization and the system of the People's Representative Conference sound and consolidated. In Fujian Province, 88.8% of the townships have convened township People's Representative Conferences. It was decided that those who have not convened them will all be convened in the second half of this year in conjunction with the central work on the basis of the peasant representative conferences. Shandong has already held township People's Representative Conferences in 85.5% of the townships, and it has been decided that those who have not convened them will all be convened this year. It is also pointed out that the basic method of district work cadres to lead the township is to participate in the township People's Representative Conference, give play to the role of grassroots political power, and establish various work committees, as far as possible, to ensure that one person holds one position, and absorb active elements from the broad masses of the people to participate in political power management, so as to solve the contradiction between township cadres' work and production.

Further promoting the work of the People's Representative Conference in various regions will play a significant role in promoting the current economic construction work and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

### 全国许多地区密切结合生产任务  推进人民代表会议的工作

    全国许多地区密切结合生产任务
    推进人民代表会议的工作
    【新华社二十七日讯】为了更好地发动群众，进行经济建设，全国许多地区都在进一步地推进人民代表会议的工作。山东、苏北、苏南、福建、绥远、青海、陕西各省都在七、八月份内召开了民政会议。甘肃、宁夏等省正在传达和贯彻西北民政会议的决议。新疆已于八月召开了专员县长会议，安徽正在召开民政会议，陕西、绥远等省正准备召开县长会议，河南陕西等省正在责令某些专署和县检查人民代表会议的工作情况。
    各地推进各界人民代表会议工作的中心环节在进一步使人民代表会议密切和各种中心工作结合，特别是和生产工作结合，以便形成经常巩固的制度。过去，曾经批判了把民主建政工作和中心工作对立起来的错误，但是，这种错误在部分专署和县仍然存在，如苏北南通专署今春因“生产工作忙”而机械地不批准启东、如皋等县召开人民代表会议，致使这些县不能更好地发动群众把生产工作做好。山东有些县虽然召开了人民代表会议，但与中心任务密切结合不够，因此，作用不大。在人民代表会议工作作的不好的专、县，前一种错误依然是主要的，工作一忙，就忽视了通过人民代表会议去讨论人民群众当前的主要事务，这就是使人民代表会议不能形成制度的主要原因。为了解决这一问题，在总结和检查工作中，各地都强调指出中心工作和人民代表会议密切不可分离的关系。福建省提出，加强民主建政工作，在目前是为了保证城乡物资交流，发展工业农业生产，和迎接大规模的经济文化建设。山东省规定，县人民代表会议每年应召开二至四次。春耕前召开一次，以贯彻全年生产任务为中心议题；秋收后召开一次，以总结全年生产，推动物资交流、贯彻冬季工作为中心议题。这两次会议必须固定召开。夏收前后，亦应召开一次，讨论当时的生产工作，如有紧急任务，可另召开临时人民代表会议。这种密切结合生产的统一布置，将充实人民代表会议的内容，成为形成制度的最好保障。
    为了充分发挥人民行使政权的权力，全国许多地区都订出具体计划，迅速使人民代表会议代行人民代表大会的职权，选举人民政府。河北、福建规定今年下半年县、市人民代表会议全部代行人民代表大会的职权。山东决定县人民代表会议今年代行一半，明春全部代行，市则今年全部代行。苏北、陕西决定县、市今年代行一部分，明年全部代行。他们都认为经过三年来的各种运动，群众的觉悟性和组织性都大大提高，由人民代表会议来选举人民政府，将使民主更为发扬，更便于人民政府去领导人民进行各项工作。
    各地还都注意了加强基层政权的工作。绥远省民政会议决议今冬明春结合土地改革复查工作，进一步发动群众，开好村人民代表会议，并选举村人民政府，使基层政权组织和人民代表会议的制度健全和巩固起来。福建全省已有百分之八十八点八的乡召开了乡人民代表会议。决定未召开者，今年下半年结合中心工作，在农民代表会议的基础上全部召开。山东已有百分之八十五点五的乡召开了乡人民代表会议，决定未召开者今年内全部召开，并指出区工作干部对乡领导的基本方法，是去参加乡人民代表会议，发挥基层政权的作用，并建立各种工作委员会，尽可能做到一人一职，吸收广大人民中的积极分子参加政权管理，以解决乡干部工作和生产的矛盾。
    各地进一步推进人民代表会议的工作，对推进当前的经济建设工作和巩固人民民主专政，将起很大的作用。
