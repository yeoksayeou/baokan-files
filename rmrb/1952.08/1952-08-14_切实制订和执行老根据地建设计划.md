    Earnestly Formulate and Implement Construction Plans for Old Revolutionary Base Areas
    Currently, leading cadres in some regions still do not pay enough attention to the work in old revolutionary base areas in mountainous regions. One of the main manifestations of this is the lack of long-term, specific, and practical plans for the construction of old revolutionary base areas. They often use temporary relief measures to help the people in old revolutionary base areas solve their production and living difficulties, but they neglect long-term construction work. The directive on strengthening the work in old revolutionary base areas, promulgated by the Government Administration Council on January 28 this year, emphasized that all localities should formulate long-term plans based on the principle of "combining the solution of the current living difficulties of the masses with long-term construction." The Second Plenary Session of the National Old Revolutionary Base Area Construction Committee, held on June 12, also made a resolution requiring the people's governments at the provincial level with jurisdiction over old revolutionary base areas to establish Old Revolutionary Base Area Construction Committees and quickly formulate plans for the comprehensive restoration and construction of old revolutionary base areas in their respective provinces (regions) in order to promote the restoration and construction of old revolutionary base areas. However, some places have not yet formulated such plans. This should be improved immediately.
    Many people in mountainous areas have developed the idea of "going down the mountain," consciously or unconsciously, because they cannot see the prospects for development in the mountainous areas. Some people have even moved down the mountain. The leadership's formulation of construction plans, and the mobilization of the masses to formulate small-scale construction plans, will enable cadres and people in mountainous areas to see their future, discover the potential strength of mountainous areas, and increase their confidence in building mountainous areas. For example, the Xigou Village in PingShun County, Shanxi Province, where Li Shunda is located, overcame the lack of confidence in the long-term construction of mountain gullies, the idea of reaching the top in production, and the idea of relying solely on the government by emphasizing difficulties, by formulating a three-year construction plan. Four households in Xigou Village originally planned to move down the mountain, but they did not leave after the construction plan was formulated. The masses in the whole village are working even harder on the current work. Individual households want to join mutual aid teams, and people in mutual aid teams want to join agricultural production cooperatives. The idea of collectivism has been further strengthened. Everyone was originally worried that there was no way out for the surplus labor force. After the construction plan was formulated, specific division of labor was carried out, and now they feel that there is not enough manpower. Under the current situation, everyone can clearly see what can be done, what cannot be done, and what can be done later. It is clear where the forest area is, where the pastoral area is, and where the cultivated area is. Everyone is no longer blindly producing and working. The political influence of the Party among the masses has been further expanded, and the masses are further united around the cadres and the Party branch. Every household has formulated its own plan, and the whole village has entered a new period of production and construction.
    Some of the construction plans for old revolutionary base areas that have been formulated in various places are not practical enough. The main deviation is that the plans are too conservative, thus reducing the role of the plans in promoting actual work. For example, the original plan of the twelve counties in Changzhi Special Area, Shanxi Province, was to build terraces and improve soil on 1.97 million mu in the first quarter of this year, but in fact, 5.5 million mu were completed. This is a typical example. Some people only see the current difficulties and believe that animal husbandry and afforestation "cannot quench the thirst with water far away," so they take the method of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, and only focus on the development of handicrafts and sideline production in the construction plan; some places only put forward the goals to be achieved every year in three or five years, but did not put forward the specific measures to be taken to achieve the goals; some places have formulated plans, but do not actively put the plans into practice; these deviations must be overcome immediately.
    In order to realize the construction plan of the old revolutionary base areas, it is necessary to organize sufficient forces to strengthen the leadership of this work. Therefore, it is very necessary to organize a certain number of cadres to "go up the mountain"; some cadres are afraid of hardship and difficulties and are unwilling to work in mountainous areas, which is completely wrong. The masses in the old revolutionary base areas urgently demand that provincial and county cadres "go up the mountain." When Yuanqu County, Shanxi Province, sent cadres to work in the old revolutionary base areas, the masses happily said: "You are finally here!" The masses are afraid that they will leave, and afraid that they will not come again after they leave. We should fully carry forward this enthusiasm of the masses in the old revolutionary base areas, help them gradually improve their economic and cultural life, guide them to move forward together with the people of the whole country, and strive to change the face of the mountainous areas in three to five years, so that the people in the mountainous areas will be freed from poverty forever.

### 切实制订和执行老根据地建设计划

    切实制订和执行老根据地建设计划
    目前若干地区的领导干部对于山地老区工作仍然不够重视。其主要的表现之一，就是对于老根据地的建设缺乏长期的具体的切实的计划。他们常常用临时救济的办法帮助老根据地人民解决生产上和生活上的困难，但忽视了长期的建设工作。政务院今年一月二十八日颁布的关于加强老根据地工作的指示中，强调指出各地应当本着“解决群众当前生活困难与长期建设相结合”的方针，制订长期的计划。全国老根据地建设委员会在六月十二日召开的第二次委员会议也作出决议，要求辖有老根据地的省一级的人民政府设立老根据地建设委员会，并迅速拟定本省（区）全面恢复和建设老根据地的计划，以便推动老根据地的恢复和建设工作。可是至今有的地方还没有把这样的计划制订出来。这是应当立即加以改进的。
    山区许多群众因为看不见山区的发展前途，产生了自觉或不自觉的“下山”思想。有些人甚至已经搬下山去了。领导方面制订建设计划，并发动群众制订小范围的建设计划，将使山地干部和群众看到自己的前途，发现山地的潜在力量，提高建设山地的信心。像李顺达所在的山西平顺西沟村订了三年建设计划，就克服了许多人对山沟的长期建设缺乏信心的思想、增产到顶的思想和强调困难单纯依赖政府的思想。西沟村原有四户准备搬下山去，订了建设计划以后也不走了。全村群众对于当前的工作干得更起劲了。单干户都想参加互助组，互助组的人都想参加农业生产合作社，集体主义的思想更加加强了。大家原来发愁剩余劳动力没有出路，订了建设计划以后，进行了具体的分工，现在感到人力不够用了。在当前情况下，什么能办，什么不办，什么缓办，每个人都明确地看到了。那里是林区，那里是牧区，那里是耕作区，都划分清楚了。大家再也不是盲目地生产和工作了。党在群众中的政治影响更加扩大了，群众更进一步团结在干部和党的支部的周围，家家户户都订出了自己的计划，全村进入了生产建设的新时期。
    各地已经订立的建设老根据地的计划，有些是不够切合实际的。其中主要的偏向是计划过于保守，因而降低了计划推动实际工作的作用。山西长治专区十二县原计划在今年第一季修梯田和改良土壤一百九十七万亩，实际上完成了五百五十万亩，就是一个典型的例子。有些人只看到当前的困难，认为畜牧、造林“远水不解近喝”，于是采取了头痛医头、脚痛医脚的办法，在建设计划中只从发展手工业、副业生产上着眼；有的地方订的计划只是提出了三年、五年中每年要达到的目标，却没有提出达到目标所要采取的具体办法；有些地方虽然订了计划，但不积极地使计划见诸实行；这些偏向都要立即加以克服。
    为了实现老根据地建设计划，必须组织足够的力量，加强对这一工作的领导。因此，组织一定数量的干部“上山”，是非常必要的；有些干部怕吃苦，怕困难，不愿到山地工作，这是十分错误的。老根据地群众迫切要求省、县干部“上山”。山西垣曲县派干部深入老根据地工作时，群众高兴地说：“你们可来啦！”群众唯恐他们离开，唯恐他们走了不再来。我们应该充分发扬老根据地群众这种热情，帮助他们一步步地提高经济生活和文化生活，引导他们和全国人民一起前进，争取在三五年内改变山区的面貌，使山区人民永远摆脱穷困的生活。
