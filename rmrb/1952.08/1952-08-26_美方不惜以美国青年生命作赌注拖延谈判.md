Title: The U.S. Is Gambling with American Youth's Lives to Delay Negotiations

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 25th: For Harrison, delaying the Korean armistice negotiations is a rather easy thing; he only needs to come to Panmunjom every seven days to sing his old tune about "opposing forced repatriation of prisoners of war." But for those American soldiers on the front lines facing the powerful Korean and Chinese People's armies, it's a different story. Every day the armistice negotiations are delayed, they are inexplicably used as tools to implement so-called "military pressure," and more and more of them are buried under the increasingly fierce firepower of the Korean and Chinese People's armies.

Just looking at the casualty figures of the U.S. military since the discussion of the prisoner of war issue began, one can see that the American aggressors are now gambling with the lives of their soldiers, hoping to win their so-called "victory." After more than two years of futile struggle, this so-called "victory" is no longer the annexation of Korea and the attempt to seize China, as the American aggressors originally hoped, but merely the detention of 13,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war and 20 percent of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war. The U.S. side is said to be detaining these prisoners of war for "humanitarian" reasons. But one cannot help but wonder how the U.S. can show "humanity" to prisoners of war from enemy countries while completely disregarding the lives of American soldiers. Especially as Brown pointed out in the "Washington Post," 80 percent of the U.S. military soldiers in Korea have no combat experience, which makes the U.S.'s gamble particularly cruel.

The discussion on the prisoner of war issue began last December; from then until the end of July this year, the U.S. military alone suffered 45,634 casualties on the Korean battlefield, which is more than 2.3 times the number of North Korean prisoners of war that the U.S. side wants to detain, or 3.5 times the number of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war they want to detain. And in the months of June and July alone, when the U.S. side strengthened its so-called "military pressure" in order to force the Korean and Chinese side to accept its unreasonable plan to detain prisoners of war, the U.S. military suffered 30,182 casualties. Regarding such heavy casualties of U.S. soldiers, even the Associated Press lamented on August 2nd, "This war thousands of miles away is costing more lives and affecting more American families month after month."

In order to cover up their heavy losses, the American aggressors are now either claiming that the fighting on the front lines is "minor" or publicizing the "achievements" of attacking certain hill positions; they are trying to give people the impression that they are at least not "losing money," and that the so-called "military pressure" is still promising. But even Americans apparently don't believe this boast. The "New York Times" said on August 3rd: "Official communiqués call the infantry activity on the front lines 'minor.' For the soldiers fighting, this is not minor. To seize numerically advantageous land, they engage in fierce battles in platoons and companies. Fierce artillery battles are also taking place. Soldiers are still being killed constantly." And in a series of battles attacking hill positions, the U.S. military's casualties were even more staggering. To give a few examples: in the battle near Height 190.8 west of Tieyuan from June 12th to 15th, more than 1,400 officers and soldiers of the 180th Regiment of the 45th Division of the U.S. military were annihilated. In July, in the battle for the nameless heights east of Shangpu Defense west of Tieyuan, the U.S. military's 2nd Division, which had just entered the position to replace the heavily damaged U.S. military's 45th Division, was annihilated by several thousand soldiers as soon as it entered the position. The U.S. military has paid such heavy casualties in order to attack a few small outposts of the Korean and Chinese side, which is enough to illustrate what the actual result of the so-called "military pressure" is.

The U.S.'s so-called "military pressure" policy will not gain any advantage. It will not only be unable to force the Korean and Chinese side to accept the U.S.'s unreasonable demand to detain 68 percent of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war and 20 percent of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war, but on the contrary, it will only make more and more thousands of American youths serve as meaningless victims of the so-called "military pressure" policy. The U.S. does not cherish or humanely treat the lives of its own youths at all, and their so-called "humanitarianism" towards Korean and Chinese prisoners of war is even more worthless.

### 美方不惜以美国青年生命作赌注拖延谈判

    美方不惜以美国青年生命作赌注拖延谈判
    【新华社开城二十五日电】对于哈利逊来说，拖延朝鲜停战谈判是一件挺轻松的事情，他只要每隔七天到板门店来唱一次所谓“反对强迫遣返战俘”的老调就行了。但是对于那些在前线上面对着强大的朝中人民军队的美国士兵们，这可是另一回事。停战谈判多拖延一天，他们就得莫名其妙地被当作施行所谓“军事压力”的工具，越来越多地葬送在朝中人民军队日益猛烈的火力下面。
    只要看一看自从战俘问题讨论开始以来美军的伤亡数字，就可以知道，美国侵略者现在正在拿他们士兵的性命作为赌注，希望赢得他们的所谓“胜利”。在经过两年多的徒然挣扎以后，这个所谓“胜利”已经不是如美国侵略者当初所希望的并吞朝鲜、进窥中国，而仅仅是扣留一万三千名中国人民志愿军战俘和百分之二十的朝鲜人民军战俘了。美方之所以要扣留这些战俘，据说是由于“人道主义”的原故。但是人们不能不奇怪，美方如何能对敌国的战俘表示“人道”，而毫不顾惜美国士兵的性命。特别是如勃朗在“华盛顿邮报”上所指出的，在朝鲜的美军士兵百分之八十并无作战经验，这就使美方的这种赌博显得特别残忍。
    有关战俘问题的讨论是在去年十二月开始的；从那时起，到今年七月底为止，在朝鲜战场上，单单美国军队就已经伤亡了四万五千六百三十四人，约为美方所要扣留的北朝鲜籍战俘的二点三倍以上，或为他们所要扣留的中国人民志愿军战俘的三点五倍。而仅仅在美方为了强迫朝中方面接受其扣留战俘的无理方案而加强所谓“军事压力”的六、七两月份中，美军的伤亡就达到了三万零一百八十二人。对于美军士兵这样的大量伤亡，连美联社也在八月二日悲叹地说：“这个万里之外的战争一个月比一个月耗费更多的生命，影响更多的美国家庭。”
    为了掩饰他们的惨重损失，美国侵略者现在不是宣传前线战斗“轻微”，就是宣传攻击某些山头阵地时的“战绩”；他们企图给人这样一个印象：他们至少没有“蚀本”，而所谓“军事压力”还是大有可为的。但是这种吹嘘显然连美国人也不相信。八月三日的“纽约时报”就说：“官方的公报把战线上的步兵活动称做为‘轻微的’。对于作战的兵士而言，这不是轻微的。为了夺取数码有利的土地，他们成排成连地进行猛烈的战斗。激烈的炮战也在进行。兵士们仍然正在不断地被杀。”而在一连串攻击山头阵地的战斗中，美军的伤亡更是惊人。举几个例来说：在六月十二日到十五日铁原以西一九零点八高地附近的战斗中，美军第四十五师一八零团的官兵被歼达一千四百多名。七月份，在铁原以西上浦防以东无名高地的争夺战中，前来接替伤亡惨重的美军第四十五师的美军第二师，刚进入阵地就被歼灭了一千数百名。为了攻击朝中方面的几个小小的前哨阵地，美军就付出了如此重大的伤亡，这就已经足够说明所谓“军事压力”的实际结果是什么了。
    美方的所谓“军事压力”政策是占不到一点便宜的，它不但决不能够迫使朝中方面接受美方扣留百分之六十八中国人民志愿军战俘和百分之二十朝鲜人民军战俘的无理要求，相反地只能使更多的成千成万的美国青年充作所谓“军事压力”政策的无谓牺牲品。美方连本国青年的生命都毫不爱惜，毫不人道，他们对待朝中战俘的所谓“人道主义”也就更不值一钱了。
