Xinhua News Agency, New York, 29th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission held meetings on the 25th and 27th to continue discussing the Soviet proposal demanding that the Disarmament Commission immediately discuss the issue of banning bacteriological weapons. At the meeting on the 25th, representatives from the United States and some other countries of the US-British bloc spoke, insisting that the US, British, and French proposal and the Commission's work plan forced through the Disarmament Commission by the US-British bloc already stipulated that the issue of bacteriological warfare should be studied, and therefore it was not necessary to include the Soviet proposal in the Commission's work plan.

	Soviet representative Malik pointed out in his speech that the arguments put forward by the representatives of the United States and other countries were untenable. Neither the tripartite proposal nor the Commission's work plan mentioned the discussion of bacteriological weapons at all, not even a mention. Malik said that now the whole world knows that the opinion of the vast majority of countries and peoples, and the opinion of the civilized world, unanimously believes that bacteriological weapons are evil, inhuman, and shameful weapons, and the use of bacteriological weapons constitutes an international crime. This has been recorded in the Geneva Protocol, and the vast majority of countries in the world have ratified the Geneva Protocol. However, the statement made by the US representative in the Disarmament Commission shows that the United States not only disagrees with this universally shared opinion, but also uses the use of these weapons as a means to threaten the world. The United Nations Disarmament Commission must not ignore this important international fact. Therefore, the Soviet delegation proposed that the Disarmament Commission immediately discuss the issue of undermining the ban on germ warfare, prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, and punishing violators of the ban on germ warfare.

	The Soviet proposal was put to a vote at the meeting on the 27th. The Soviet representative voted in favor. Representatives from Pakistan and Chile abstained. Representatives from the US-British bloc, led by the United States, voted against it. In this way, the United States has once again shown its opposition to banning bacteriological weapons and opposing the ratification of the Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological warfare. In order to conceal their attitude of refusing to adopt the Soviet proposal, the US delegation and some other delegations that followed it adopted an "amendment" that was not binding on them, stipulating that the issue of bacteriological weapons should be included in the work plan of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, but this plan did not stipulate the prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction.

	When analyzing the results of the vote, Malik said that the US-British bloc had refused for the second time to discuss the issue of banning bacteriological weapons in the Disarmament Commission. Obviously, the United States has adopted this attitude entirely in order to be able to prepare and conduct germ warfare without restriction. The US-British bloc's inclusion of this issue in the Commission's work plan is entirely a deceptive smokescreen, attempting to conceal the US government's refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol and its refusal to abide by the international principles of banning bacteriological weapons.

    联合国裁军委员会上美英集团拒绝通过苏联提案
    马立克斥美国准备并进行细菌战的罪行
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约消息：联合国裁减军备委员会于二十五日及二十七日举行会议，继续讨论苏联所提出的要求裁军委员会立即讨论禁止细菌武器问题的提案。美国及美英集团其他某些国家的代表在二十五日会议上发言，硬说美、英、法三国提案和美英集团强使裁军委员会通过的委员会工作计划中已经规定要研究细菌战问题，因而无须把苏联提案列入委员会工作计划。苏联代表马立克发言指出：美国及其他国家代表所提出的论据是站不住脚的。三国提案或委员会工作计划都根本没有谈到讨论细菌武器问题，甚至连提都没有提起细菌武器。马立克说：现在全世界都知道：很大多数的国家与人民的意见、文明世界的舆论，一致认为细菌武器是罪恶的、不人道的及无耻的武器，使用细菌武器就构成国际罪行。这已记载在日内瓦议定书上，而世界上绝大多数国家都已批准了日内瓦议定书。但是美国代表在裁军委员会上的发言表明，美国非但不同意这种举世共有的意见，反而以使用这些武器作为威胁世界的手段。联合国裁军委员会决不能忽视这件重要的国际事实。因此苏联代表团建议裁军委员会立即讨论破坏细菌战禁令、禁止使用细菌武器及惩罚细菌战禁令违反者的问题。苏联提案在二十七日会议上付表决。苏联代表投票赞成。巴基斯坦和智利代表弃权。以美国为首的美英集团代表投票反对。这样，美国就再一次表明了它反对禁止细菌武器、反对批准禁止细菌战的日内瓦议定书。为了掩盖他们拒绝通过苏联提案的态度，美国代表团和其他某些追随它的代表团通过了一个对他们毫无约束力的“修正案”，规定把细菌武器问题列入联合国裁军委员会的工作计划里，而这个计划却并不规定禁止原子武器、细菌武器和其他类型的大规模杀人武器。马立克在分析表决的结果时说，美英集团已经第二次拒绝在裁军委员会讨论禁止细菌武器的问题。很明显，美国采取这种态度完全是为了使它能够毫无约束地准备并进行细菌战。美英集团通过把这问题列入委员会的工作计划，完全是一种迷惑人的烟幕，企图把美国政府拒绝批准日内瓦议定书及拒绝遵守禁用细菌武器的国际原则的行为掩盖起来。
