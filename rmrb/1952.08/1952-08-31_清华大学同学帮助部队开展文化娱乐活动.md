    Tsinghua University Students Help Troops Carry Out Cultural and Recreational Activities
    Editor: Since our troops arrived in the suburbs of Beijing, we have established close ties with the students of Tsinghua University. Many students personally came to our troops to teach soldiers dancing and acting. In two months, they taught eight or nine dances such as "Labor Victory Dance" and "Soldier Dance," and four or five harmonica tunes, which enlivened the cultural and recreational life of the troops. In early July, the soldiers and students held a get-together, at which the political instructor, on behalf of the troops, presented the university with a silk banner.

    Recently, the troops launched a cultural study campaign. Three students from Tsinghua University, including Wu Xiaoping, moved into the troops during the summer vacation to help teach classes and teach soldiers dancing in their spare time. With their help, the soldiers are very enthusiastic about learning, and most comrades have bought harmonicas. One afternoon, I went to the battalion headquarters, and Comrade Wu Xiaoping was teaching a class. She explained very clearly. She wrote the new characters on the blackboard, spelled them out with letters, and marked them with homophones, making it easy for everyone to remember. Their spirit of serving the soldiers is worthy of learning.

    清华大学同学帮助部队开展文化娱乐活动
    编辑同志：我们部队到京郊以后，就和清华大学的同学取得了密切的联系。许多同学亲自到咱们部队里教战士们跳舞、演戏，在两个月中教了“劳动胜利舞”、“战士舞”等八九个舞蹈和四、五个口琴曲子，活跃了部队的文化娱乐生活。战士们和同学们在七月上旬开了一个联欢会，会上教导员代表部队送给该校一面锦旗。
    最近部队展开文化学习运动，清华大学吴小萍等三位同学在暑假搬到部队里来住，帮助教课，并在课余时间教战士们舞蹈。战士们在他们的帮助下，学习情绪都很高，大多数同志都买了口琴。有一天下午我到营部去，吴小萍同志正在上课，她讲得非常清楚。她把生字写在黑板上，再用字母拼出来，又注上同音字，使大家很容易记住。他们这种为兵服务的精神，是值得学习的。
