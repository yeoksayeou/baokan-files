    Blind Design and Construction at Dagu Salt Field Causes Losses

    Due to a lack of thorough surveying and investigation, the state-owned Dagu Salt Field incurred significant losses from the blind design and construction of two basic construction projects undertaken in the first half of this year.

    This spring, the field opened a large pool (a place to store seawater) in preparation for evaporating high-concentration brine for salt production. This project was "completed on schedule" at the end of April. However, when seawater was released into the pool after the project's completion, it was discovered that the top of the water diversion channel (the ditch for conveying seawater) was 0.2 meters higher than the storage area, preventing the water from reaching the pool. As a result, further construction was required to clear the diversion channel. To pump water from the large pool to the storage area, the field added two electric motors. After the machines were installed, they couldn't reach the water. Dozens of workers were hired to dig a ditch approximately 700 meters long. The installation team also extended the excavation from the machine site toward the large pool, wasting a total of 300 man-days and taking seven to eight days. It wasn't until late June or early July that the water from the large pool was pumped into the storage area. By this time, the spring salt production season was almost over, and the water from the pool was not utilized during the entire spring production. The project cost over 200 million yuan, was delayed by two months, and missed the peak salt production season, causing significant losses to production.

    In addition, to promptly supply high-concentration saltwater to each salt pan, the field added two electric motors at Xiaoshuimen in a certain district for pumping water. Many errors occurred during this project as well. The base of the electric roller was located on five meters of new soil, which was not surveyed beforehand. After the problem was discovered, no piles were driven. Electrician Ding Zhaoshu pointed out to the supervisors that it was impossible to build on new soil without piles. The supervisors responded, "There is no plan for it from above, and no materials." As a result, the construction was carried out in a confused manner. The cement base of the machine was 1.2 meters long, 1.3 meters deep, and 0.8 meters wide. The cement base was laid, and after one night, before the electric roller was even installed, it sank and became tilted. Two more cement pads were added to compensate, but piles were still not driven. According to experienced individuals, there is a possibility of problems if the machine is operated continuously in the future. After discovering the many errors in this project, no timely measures were taken to correct them. Instead, a certain project personnel said, "We must quickly repair it; otherwise, we won't be able to pass the inspection when the higher authorities come to check."

    The failure of the above two projects not only wasted state funds but also delayed production. This is a matter that deserves attention. After the People's Daily put forward "Construction is impossible without correct design" last year, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Basic Construction Work," which clearly stated that "design and construction should not be carried out without thorough survey and investigation." The cadres in charge of engineering at the field neglected basic construction to such an extent that they did not personally oversee it and instead delegated it to engineering personnel. Furthermore, some technical personnel adopted an irresponsible attitude toward state property and failed to listen to the positive suggestions of the masses, resulting in the loss of state property. This is a major lesson, and the cadres in charge of engineering and the engineering personnel at the field should conduct a profound self-criticism.

### 大沽盐场盲目设计施工造成损失

    大沽盐场盲目设计施工造成损失
    国营大沽盐场在今年上半年所进行的两项基本建设工程中，由于没有进行周密的勘测和调查，就盲目设计、施工，造成了严重的损失。
    该场今春开辟了一个大汪子（储存海水的地方），准备蒸发出高度的卤水来晒盐。这项工程在四月底是“按期完工”了，但是，当工程竣工后向大汪子里放海水时，却因为导水路（输送海水沟）顶端地势比储水处高零点二米，大汪子水过不来，只好又施工疏通导水路。为了把大汪子里的海水抽到储水处去，该场增设了两台电动机准备抽水。机器安好了，但够不着水；又招雇了数十名工人挑挖了一条长约七百米的沟。又由安装机器处向大汪子里伸长挑挖，共浪费人工三百个，费时七、八天，直到六月底七月初才将大汪子的水扬进储水处去。这时春季晒盐已将结束，整个春季生产中没有利用上该汪子里的水。该项工程用款二亿多元，耽搁了两个月，错过了产盐旺季，使生产受到了很大的损失。
    此外，该场为了及时供给各滩高度的咸水，在某区小水门增设两台电动机准备抽水。在进行这项工程中，又发生了许多错误。电滚座子底下有五米深的新土，事先没有注意勘测，发现以后，又没有打桩。电工丁兆枢曾向监工人员提出：新土不打桩不行，监工员说：“上边没有计划，没有材料。”于是就这样糊里糊涂的施工了。该机器洋灰座长一点二米，深一点三米，宽零点八米。打好洋灰座后，隔了一夜，还没有安电滚就沉了，并且歪了。又把洋灰座加偏垫两个，仍然没有打桩。据有经验的人说：今后如果连续开车，还有可能出毛病。发现这件工程许多错误以后，也没有及时设法纠正，某工程人员反而说：“咱们得赶快修理一下，否则上级来验收时交不了。”
    以上两项工程的失败，不仅浪费了国家资金，而且延误了生产，这是值得注意的问题。去年人民日报提出了“没有正确设计就不可能施工”以后，中央人民政府财政经济委员会曾公布了“基本建设工作暂行办法”，明确提出了“没有周密的勘察和调查，就不能设计和施工”。该场负责工程的干部对基本建设如此忽视，不亲自掌握，交给工程人员去办。而某些技术人员对国家财产采取了不负责的态度，对群众的积极建议又不听取，招致了国家财产的损失，这是一个很大的教训，该场负责工程的干部和工程人员应作深刻的检讨。
