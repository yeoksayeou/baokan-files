The Spark Collective Farm is Moving Forward
By Our Correspondent Tian Liu

In June of this year, I visited the Ninth Farm of the Hwathuan Water Conservancy Farm – the "Spark" Collective Farm – for the second time. At that time, a feeling of warmth and enthusiasm, like returning to my hometown, grew stronger and stronger, stirring me deeply.

Approaching the collective farm, I carefully observed everything around me. The members were working in the rice paddies, quickly and conscientiously removing weeds from the fields. The collective farm's rice plants were growing very strong, already nearly knee-high. The collective farm was indeed different; all the rice paddies were very neatly planned. Each rice terrace was fifty meters wide. This made it easier to work collectively and use machinery, and easier to implement advanced quota management and zone responsibility systems. This alone was far superior to the dispersed small-peasant economy.

In just three months, the collective farm had changed dramatically. At the entrance to the farm, a plaque bearing the name "Spark Collective Farm" hung high. Three months earlier, when I first visited it, it did not yet have a name. Comrade Li Zaigen, the secretary of the farm's Party branch, said at the time, "Let's run the farm well first; as for the name, we'll take our time." After the farm's story appeared in the newspaper, many letters immediately arrived from all over the country and from the Korean front: some asking about the experience of organizing collective farms, some asking about the lives of the members, and some requesting to visit and learn. Many of the letters ended with, "I don't know if you'll receive this letter, because the newspaper only mentioned 'a collective farm' and didn't give the farm's name." This time, when the branch secretary saw me, his first sentence was, "We can't do things secretly anymore; we have to have a name."

The collective farm was building houses. A female member, covered in mud, told me that this was the "public canteen," specifically prepared for the farm's bachelors and visiting guests. Next to the public canteen was the newly built nursery. More than twenty children were playing under the care of two nannies. They had so many toys: small cars, small airplanes, dolls, bronze drums, and bugles... A few days ago, the farm bought a Dutch dairy cow for the children. During the day, when their mothers went to the fields, the children ate rich, creamy milk in the nursery. Beyond the nursery was the primary school, which had also changed. In the past, there were children's desks here; now there were large writing tables. Li Chenglin, the grain and finance committee member, and a young female accountant were buried in organizing accounts. This had become the office. "The school has moved to the rice mill," Li Chenglin explained. "The rice mill has already processed all the farm's rice into polished rice; it has nothing to do until the new rice comes down. The rice mill building is tall and cool in the summer, so we moved the school there." Afterwards, he pointed to a large square to the east and said, "We will build a new school there, and in the autumn, the children can go to their new classrooms." Many red bricks had already been piled up on the square, and it looked like construction would begin soon.

I went to see my landlord from my last visit to the farm. Shen Zicheng's family had become even more beautiful. Two portraits of Shen Zicheng's father had been added to the wall. These were painted by young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts who came to the farm to experience life not long ago. The seventy-year-old Shen Chengtian began talking to me about the farm before he even finished eating. This year, the farm had formed six production teams: four male production teams, one female production team, and one old men's team led by Shen Chengtian. "The other production teams all have a dozen or so people, but our team only has three old men," the old man said, sounding like he was complaining. "I'm a few years older than those two, so they elected me as the old men's team leader. The old men's team is responsible for cultivating four and a half hectares of seed-breeding fields. The farm stipulates that each hectare must produce 10,000 jin. When the spring plowing began, we made a guarantee to the farm: 'Not only will we make the grains grow full and plump, so that the whole farm can use our own good seeds next year, but we will also reach a yield of 12,000 jin.'"

"We have to set an example for the young people," Shen Chengtian said cheerfully. "What we say, we have to do..."

In the spring, when the rice seedlings were just sprouting, a strong wind suddenly blew up. The spring winds in northern Manchuria are very strong. They can bury newly emerging seedlings in the soil, and they can also knock down mature wheat and sorghum to the ground. The wind lifted the water in the rice paddies, battering the banks of the rice terraces. The three old men, who had lived in northern Manchuria for decades and were skilled in farming, spontaneously carried large bundles of rice straw and went to the seed-breeding fields. They inserted the rice straw one by one along the sides of the banks, like driving stakes to protect a riverbank. Sure enough, after the rice straw was inserted, the water could no longer batter the banks. The other production teams saw the old men doing this and followed suit, inserting rice straw along the banks of all the rice paddies.

Shen Chengtian and his son were about to go to the fields, and I went to the home of the Party branch secretary, Li Zaigen. On the way, the branch secretary said, "This family is about to become the farm's model family. The father is the old men's team leader, and the son is the men's team leader. His family occupies two team leader positions out of the six teams on the entire farm." He said, "It's not easy to become a model on our farm. Everyone is so good, everyone is working so hard." Then, Li Zaigen told the story of Jiang Jingxiao. In the first two years after arriving at the farm, Jiang Jingxiao couldn't even afford a pair of pants in the summer, and he went around with a torn burlap sack around his waist. Later, with the help of Comrade Jin Baishan, he joined the mutual aid group and the collective farm, and his life improved. The collective farm gave him a happy life that he had never had before. Therefore, he truly regarded the farm as his own home. Last year, before the autumn harvest, wild ducks damaged the rice paddies, and he fought the wild ducks single-handedly for three days, and still participated in the farm's labor with the other members. The branch secretary said, "Since the news about our farm appeared in the newspaper, he was overjoyed to see that he was also mentioned in the article. He said, 'Who says farmers aren't important? Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, aren't we "bitter people" also getting written about and reported on?' His work has become even more active than before. When sowing, there was a rain shower one day, which delayed work for more than an hour. He said: 'The rain has delayed our work, we have to make it pay us back.' He greedily worked in the dark for more than an hour and finally completed the sowing task."

Jiang Jingxiao was just an ordinary member of the collective farm; everyone on the entire farm was carrying out creative labor just like him. There was a lot of rain last autumn, and the ground was wet and the soil was loose this spring. When "water-strip sowing" was implemented, the seed drill sank into the field as soon as it entered, and one seed drill could only sow five mu of land per day, which looked like it would delay the sowing period. Chairman Jin Baishan came up with a "early sowing method of water-strip sowing." Initially, water was not put into the rice paddies; water would be put in after the seeds were sown – first slowly irrigate it with a little water, and put in the full amount of water for water-strip sowing after the seeds had settled in the soil. With this change, the sowing speed doubled, from half a hectare to more than one and a half hectares per day. This not only avoided delaying the proper sowing period, but also brought it forward by eight days compared to last year.

The creative labor of all the members enabled the Spark Collective Farm to achieve new victories in production.

This year, the Spark Collective Farm increased from 36 households last year to 61 households, and the cultivated area expanded from 99 hectares to 190 hectares. The area of cultivated land borne by each worker increased from 2.8 hectares to 3.3 hectares. As the members' enthusiasm for labor has further increased, the state-owned Hwathuan Water Conservancy Farm was changed to a tractor station this March, expanding the scope of mechanical operation on the collective farm. This has made the land increase several times over, making cultivation more timely and meticulous. During the spring plowing last year, it took thirteen workdays from tilling to sowing; this year, it only took ten workdays, and at the same time, the sowing period was brought forward by eight days. By the time of "Mangzhong" [Grain in Ear], the sowing of all the farm's rice paddies was completed. Last year, out of 99 hectares of land, only one and a half hectares was scientific "dry direct seeding," and 60 hectares was advanced "water-strip sowing," which means that nearly 40 percent of the rice paddies were carrying out rough "broadcast sowing" operations. This year, out of 190 hectares of land, only 13 hectares – less than 7 percent of the total area – were broadcast sown, and the rest were scientific dry direct seeding and water-strip sowing. According to the farm's production experience last year, whether dry direct seeding or water-strip sowing, at least 20 percent more grain is harvested than with broadcast sowing. This year, the seeds used in the collective farm's rice paddies are all high-quality varieties cultivated by the state-owned farm, and they have been wind-selected or water-selected more than twice before sowing; 25 hectares of seeds have even been disinfected by soaking in warm water. Seed germination tests were carried out on all the rice seeds, and the amount of sowing was accurately controlled according to the seed germination rate. Speaking of the amount of sowing, such a thing happened last year: Before sowing, the leading cadres of the Hwathuan Water Conservancy Farm repeatedly promoted the benefits of "dense planting" to the members, and everyone felt that it made sense. Only one production team didn't believe it. They said, "For so many years, we have never planted so many seeds per hectare. How can the seedlings grow if they are so dense?" This team still planted according to the old rules. In the autumn, the average yield per hectare on the entire farm was 8,900 jin, but that team only harvested 6,000 jin. When sowing this year, this team was the first to advocate dense planting. All 190 hectares of rice paddies on the entire farm were densely planted, with a sowing amount of 200 jin per hectare. The seedlings that grew out were neat and strong, and they were dark green and shiny. On June 19, when I visited the collective farm for the second time, the rice in the nearby villages was only two or three inches high, and the Spark Collective Farm had already weeded the first time and was starting to weed the second time. This year, the farm plans to weed four times. "This is the plan," the branch secretary said. "All six production teams guarantee that they will weed whenever there are weeds." The actual situation I saw today was also like this. Four production teams had more weeds in their cultivation areas, so they went to weed again; two production teams had no weeds in their cultivation areas, so they stayed in the village to prepare manure. This year, the farm's rice paddies have been universally fertilized, which is very valuable in a place like northern Manchuria where there has never been a fertilizing habit. In order to lay a foundation for a bumper harvest next year, during the summer weeding, the members must accumulate 3 million jin of manure, enough for 100 hectares of land to use.

Time flies when you're talking to your dearest friends. It was already dark when I said goodbye to the collective farm. Before leaving, Comrade Li Zaigen, the branch secretary, asked me to convey the recent situation of the collective farm to the people who care about it. He said that he has been busy with work recently and cannot reply to letters from various places in a timely manner. "We will definitely follow the instructions of Chairman Mao and the People's Government and do our best to run our Spark Collective Farm – the first collective farm in the new China – well." Li Zaigen said sincerely, "Otherwise, how can it be called the 'Spark' Collective Farm?" A single spark can start a prairie fire.

    星火集体农庄在前进
    本报记者  田流
    今年六月，我第二次访问桦川水利农场的第九农庄——“星火”集体农庄。当时，有一种像回到自己的故乡那样的亲切、热烈的情感，越来越强烈地激动着我。
    走近集体农庄，我细心地观察周围的一切。庄员们正在稻田中劳动，迅速而认真地拔除田间的杂草。农庄的稻禾长的很壮，这时已经快有膝盖高了。集体农庄到底与众不同，所有的稻田都规划得非常整齐。每个稻畦都是五十公尺宽。这样更便于集体劳动和机械作业，更便于实行先进的定额管理和分区负责制。只这一点，就比分散的小农经济优越得多了。
    三个月不见，集体农庄的样子就大变了。农庄入口处，高悬着“星火集体农庄”的匾额。三个月以前我第一次访问它，它还没有名字。农庄中共支部书记李在根同志当时说：“先把农庄办好，至于名字，慢慢来吧。”报纸上登出了农庄的事情以后，从全国各地、从朝鲜前线，立刻寄来了许多信：有的问组织集体农庄的经验，有的问庄员的生活，有的要求来参观和学习。好些信的末尾都写着：“不知道这封信你们能收到不，因为报纸上只说“一个集体农庄”，没登出农庄的名字。这一次，支部书记见了我，头一句就说：“想偷偷地干不行了，得有个名字啦。”
    集体农庄正盖房子。一个满身泥浆的女庄员告诉我，这是“公共食堂”，专给农庄里的单身汉和来参观的客人预备的。公共食堂旁边，是新建起来的托儿所。二十多个孩子，正在两个阿姨照顾下玩耍。他们的玩具真多，有小汽车、小飞机、洋娃娃、铜鼓和洋号……。前些日子，农庄为孩子们买来一头荷兰乳牛。白天，妈妈下地去了，孩子们便在托儿所吃着浓醇的牛奶。托儿所再过去是小学校，它也变了。过去这里摆着孩子们的书桌，现在摆的是宽大的写字台。财粮委员李成林和一个年青的女会计正在埋头整理账目。这里已变成办公室了。“学校搬到制米厂去了”李成林解释说：“制米厂已把全庄的稻谷制成大米，新稻下来以前，它没有事干。制米厂房子高大，夏天凉快，就把学校搬到那里去了。”过后，他指着东面的一片大广场说：“我们要在那里盖起新学校，秋天，孩子们就可以到他们的新教室去上课了。”广场上已堆起很多红砖，看样子不久就要动工了。
    我到上次访问农庄时的房东家里去看。慎自成的家庭变得更美好了。墙上添了两张慎自成父亲的画像。这是不久以前中央美术学院的青年画家们来农庄体验生活时画的。七十岁的慎成天老汉没等到吃完饭，就同我谈起农庄的事情。今年农庄组成了六个生产队，四个男生产队，一个女生产队，一个慎成天的老头队。“别的生产队都是十几个人，只有我们队是三个老头子，”老汉诉苦似地说：“我比那两个人大几岁，他们就把我选成了老头队长。老头队负责耕作四公顷半采种田，农庄规定，每公顷产一万斤。我们在春耕开始时向农庄提出保证：“不光让它长的籽粒饱满，使全庄在明年都用自家的好种子，还要使产量达到一万二千斤。”
    “得给青年人作出个样子，”慎成天乐呵呵地说：“说得出就得作得到啊……。”
    春天，稻子正发幼芽的时候，忽然刮起大风来了。北满的春风是很厉害的。它能把刚出土的禾苗埋在土里，也会把长大了的麦子、高粱摔死在地上。稻田的水被风掀起，冲击着稻畦的池埂子。三个在北满生活了几十年、长于农事的老人看到这种情形，不约而同地背着大捆的稻秆，走到采种田里。他们像在河堤前面打下护堤桩一样，把稻秆一根根地插在池埂两旁。果然，插上稻秆后，水就不能冲击池埂了。别的生产队见老头们这样作，也跟着学习，在全部稻田的池埂两旁，都插上了稻秆。
    慎成天父子要下地了，我到支部书记李在根家里去。路上，支部书记说：“这个家庭快成农庄的模范家庭了。父亲是老头队长，儿子是男子队长，全庄六个队，他家就占了两个队长。”他说：“在我们农庄，想成为模范可不容易。人人都这样好，人人都这样努力。”接着，李在根叙述了姜敬孝的故事。刚到农场的头二年，姜敬孝在夏天连条单裤也混不上，腰里围着块破麻袋过日子。后来，在金白山同志的帮助下，他参加了互助组，入了集体农庄，生活好起来了。集体农庄给了他从来没有过的幸福生活。因此，他把农庄真正看成了自己的家。去年秋收前，野鸭糟害稻田，他单人独马地同野鸭搏斗了三天，还照样和其他庄员参加农庄的劳动。支部书记说：“自从报纸上登出我们农庄的消息，他看到文章里还有他，高兴极了。他说，谁说庄稼人不上经传？在毛主席领导下，咱“受苦人”不是照样的入了书上了报么？他的工作比以前更积极了。播种时有一天下了一阵雨，误了一个多钟头，他说：雨耽误了咱的工作，要叫它还咱们。”贪了一个多钟头的黑，到底把播种任务完成了。”
    姜敬孝只是集体农庄里一个普通的庄员，全庄每一个人，都和他一样地进行着创造性的劳动。去年秋雨多，今春地湿土虚，施行“水条播”时，播种机一到田里就往下陷，一台播种机一天才能种五亩地，眼看就要耽误播种期。主席金白山想出了一个
    “水条播的早播法”最初不在稻田里上水，等把种子播好了再上水——先慢慢地用小水浸润，等把种子固着在土里，再放入水条播的足水量。这样一作，播种速度加快了两倍，每天由半公顷提高到一公顷半以上，不但没有耽误适期播种，还比去年提前了八天。
    全体庄员们的创造性劳动，使星火集体农庄获得了生产上的新胜利。
    今年，星火集体农庄由去年的三十六户增加到六十一户，耕地面积由九十九公顷扩大到一百九十公顷。每个劳动力担负的耕地面积，从二点八公顷增加到三点三公顷。由于庄员们的劳动积极性进一步提高了，国营桦川水利农场今年三月又改成了拖拉机站，扩大了集体农庄机械作业的范围，这就使得土地虽然成倍的增加，耕作却更加及时和细致了。去年春耕期间，从翻地到播种需要十三个工，今年只用了十个工，还同时把播种期提前了八天，不到
    “芒种”，全庄稻田就播种完了。去年九十九公顷土地中，只有一公顷半是科学的“旱直播”，六十公顷是先进的“水条播”，这就是说，有近百分之四十的稻田是实行了粗放的“撒种”作业。今年
    一百九十公顷土地，只有十三公顷——不到总面积百分之七是撒播的，其余都是科学的旱直播和水条播。据农庄去年的生产经验，无论旱直播或水条播，至少要比撒播多收获百分之二十的谷物。今年，集体农庄稻田里用的种子，都是国营农场培育出来的优良品种，播种前还经过两次以上的风选或水选；有二十五公顷的种子，更经过温汤浸种消毒。稻种都作了发芽试验，按照种子的发芽率，准确地掌握了播种量。说到播种量，去年还发生过这样一件事情：播种前，桦川水利农场的领导干部一再向庄员们宣传“密植”的好处，大家听了，都觉得很有道理。只有一个生产组不信。他们说：“多少年来，一公顷也没种过这么多籽，苗那么密，欺的还能长吗？”这个组还按着老规矩种下了。到秋天，全农庄每公顷平均产量是八千九百斤，他们那一组才收了六千斤。今年播种时，这个组首先主张密植，全庄一百九十公顷稻田，块块都是密植的，每公顷的播种量达二百斤，苗子长出来又整齐又茁壮，绿得黑亮黑亮的。六月十九日，我二次访问集体农庄时，附近农村的稻子，长的刚刚两、三寸高，星火集体农庄已经锄完头遍草，开始锄二遍了。今年，农庄计划锄四遍草，“这是计划，”支部书记说：“六个生产队都保证作到有草就锄”。今天，我看到的实际情形也是这样的，有四个生产队的耕作区里草多些，他们又去锄草了；有两个生产队耕作区里没有草，他们就留在庄里捣粪土。今年，农庄的稻田普遍施肥了，这在北满从来没有施肥习惯的地方，是很可贵的。为了打下明年的丰产基础，夏锄期间，庄员们要积够三百万斤粪肥，足够一百公顷土地使用。
    同最亲爱的朋友谈心，时间是跑得很快的。同集体农庄告别时，天色已经大黑了。临别时，支部书记李在根同志托我把集体农庄的近况，转告给关心它的人们。他说，近来工作较忙，不能把各地的来信及时作复。“我们一定按着毛主席和人民政府的指示，用全力把我们星火集体农庄——新中国第一个集体农庄办好。”李在根诚挚地说：“要不还能叫‘星火’集体农庄吗？”星星之火是可以变成燎原的火焰的。
