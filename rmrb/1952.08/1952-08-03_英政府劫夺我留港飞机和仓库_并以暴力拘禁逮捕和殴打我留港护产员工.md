Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 2nd. The British government, complying with the will of the United States, used force to seize our civil aviation aircraft and warehouses in Hong Kong for the benefit of American imperialist elements, and detained, arrested, and beat more than two hundred of our employees stationed in Hong Kong to protect state property.

Following the British Privy Council's illegal "ruling" on July 28th that forty of our aircraft in Hong Kong belonged to the American swindler Claire Chennault, the British authorities in Hong Kong dispatched a large number of armored vehicles, police vans, and police officers around 2:00 AM on the 28th to surround the Kai Tak Airport and two warehouses where our aircraft and materials were located. They then stormed into these locations, forcibly seizing the property and violently attacking our employees who were steadfastly protecting state property. Employees guarding the Kai Tak Airport were beaten and arrested by British police, then detained, and not fully released until 2:00 AM on the 30th. It has been confirmed that five of our employees were injured in the beatings: Liu Muyang, Ye He, Deng Yuansong, Zhu Jinbiao, and Wu Tengsheng. Liu Muyang was beaten until his face was covered in blood and he fainted several times. A group of employees guarding the warehouse were arrested and taken to the police station, and were not released until 9:10 PM on the 29th; another group was detained in an open area, subjected to body searches, and deprived of their freedom for twelve hours.

From beginning to end, the British government has complied with the will of the United States, colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang, and deliberately plotted to seize the aircraft and materials of our Lianghang (Two Airlines) companies. The American swindler Chennault, in collusion with the Kuomintang bandit remnants, began "litigation" in the British court in Hong Kong on December 19, 1949, demanding to "take over" the seventy aircraft and materials left in Hong Kong by the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Corporation, which our Central People's Government had already declared to be the property of the People's Republic of China on December 3, 1949. Due to the protests of our people, the British High Court in Hong Kong had to reject Chennault's shameless demands at the time, and subsequently ruled against him in several "property rights lawsuits" filed by Chennault under the fictitious name of the so-called "American Civil Aviation Transport Company"; and in several judgments, it had to admit that these aircraft and other assets belonged to the People's Republic of China. However, on May 10, 1950, the British government issued a Privy Council order freezing our aircraft assets, in order to continue to play legal tricks so that Chennault could change his tactics and re-file the lawsuit. In May and October of 1950, the Central People's Government repeatedly protested to the British government against its illegal infringement of our state property, and firmly stated that the British government should be fully responsible if our aircraft assets were infringed upon, transferred, or damaged.

Starting in March 1951, Chennault changed his tactics and filed a separate "lawsuit" against the forty aircraft belonging to the former Central Air Transport Corporation. The British court and High Court in Hong Kong still had to reject Chennault's demands each time, and repeatedly confirmed in their judgments that the company's forty aircraft and parts were the property of the People's Republic of China. However, in practice, the British government allowed Chennault to "appeal" again to the British Privy Council in London on January 9 this year, and the Council overturned the previous judgments of the British court on July 28, openly and illegally declaring that these forty aircraft "belonged to Chennault's American Civil Aviation Transport Company."

Now Chennault's "Civil Aviation Transport Company" continues to seize the thirty aircraft of the former China National Aviation Corporation. The British High Court in Hong Kong opened a hearing on July 25 and is now "awaiting judgment."

    英政府劫夺我留港飞机和仓库
    并以暴力拘禁逮捕和殴打我留港护产员工
    【新华社广州二日电】英国政府顺从美国的意旨用武力替美帝国主义分子劫夺我国在香港的民航飞机和仓库，并将我留在香港保护国家财产的职工二百多人拘禁、逮捕和殴打。
    英国政府枢密院七月二十八日非法“判决”我国在香港的飞机四十架归美国骗子陈纳德所有之后，香港英国当局即于二十八日午夜二时左右，分别派遣大批装甲车、冲锋车和大队警察，将我国飞机及物资停放所在地的启德机场和两个仓库包围，随即冲进上述地点内，强行劫夺，并对我坚守岗位保护国家财产的职工横施暴力。在启德机场看守的职工被英警殴击，逮捕，然后拘禁，至三十日晨二时始全部获释。我国职工被殴击已查明受伤的有刘木养、叶和、邓原松、朱锦标、吴腾生等五人，其中刘木养被击至满脸鲜血，晕倒数次。看守仓库的职工有一批被拘捕到警署，至二十九日晚上九时十分才被释放；另一批拘禁在空场上，强行搜查身体，失掉自由达十二小时。
    英国政府自始至终顺从美国意旨、勾结国民党残余匪帮，蓄意谋夺我两航公司的飞机和物资。美国骗子陈纳德与国民党残匪同谋于一九四九年十二月十九日即开始向香港英国法院提出“诉讼”，要求“接收”早经我中央人民政府于一九四九年十二月三日宣布为中华人民共和国财产的中国航空公司和中央航空公司留在香港的七十架飞机及物资。由于我国人民的抗议，当时香港英国高等法院曾不得不将陈纳德的无耻要求驳回，并在此后陈纳德以所谓“美国民用航空运输公司”的虚构名义继续进行多次的“产权诉讼”中判他败诉；并在多次判决中亦不得不承认：这些飞机及其他资财是中华人民共和国所有。然而，一九五零年五月十日英国政府又发出冻结我国飞机资财的枢密院令，以便继续玩弄法律戏法，使陈纳德能够变换花样，重提讼案。一九五零年五月及十月，中央人民政府曾对英国政府非法侵犯我国国家财产的行为一再提出抗议，坚决声明我国飞机资财如有被侵犯、转移或损坏等情事，英国政府应负全责。
    从一九五一年三月起，陈纳德变换花样，单独对前中央航空公司所属的四十架飞机进行“诉讼”，香港英国法院及高等法院仍然不得不每次驳回陈纳德的要求，并于判词内一再确认该公司的四十架飞机及零件等都是中华人民共和国的财产。然而，在实际上英国政府又容许陈纳德于今年一月九日向伦敦英国枢密院再度提出“上诉”，该院即于七月二十八日推翻了英国法院以往历次判决，公然非法宣判这四十架飞机是“属于陈纳德的美国民用航空运输公司所有。”
    现在陈纳德的“民用航空运输公司”继续劫夺前中国航空公司的三十架飞机。香港英国高等法院已于七月二十五日开庭受理，现在“押候判决”中。
