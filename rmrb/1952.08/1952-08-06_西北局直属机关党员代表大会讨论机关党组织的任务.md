The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs Committee convened its first Party Congress from July 16th to 19th. The congress focused on discussing the following three tasks for the Party organizations in the organs in the future: First, strengthen the political and ideological work of the Party in the organs. The congress unanimously agreed that this is a fundamental method for improving the political consciousness and work ability of cadres, and at the same time, it is the basis and prerequisite for Party organizations in the organs to do all their work well. In order to achieve this task, Party organizations must lead Party and non-Party cadres well in studying theory, current affairs, policies, and culture. When conducting these studies, it is necessary to link them with actual thinking and effectively solve the problems existing in thinking. Second, improve the democratic life and democratic system of the Party. In the future, directly subordinate organs must hold branch meetings, general branch meetings, and even democratic meetings of organ cadres regularly, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and give Party and non-Party cadres the opportunity to fully express their opinions and discuss issues, in order to improve their sense of responsibility and creativity for the Party's work. Third, building the Party. After the great "Three-Anti" movement, a large number of activists have emerged in directly subordinate organs. Many of them have applied to join the Party. Therefore, the Party organizations of directly subordinate organs should follow the Party's policies, plan, prepare, and lead the admission of a group of outstanding members into the Party.

    西北局直属机关党员代表大会讨论机关党组织的任务
    中共中央西北局直属机关委员会于七月十六日至十九日召开第一次党员代表大会，着重讨论了今后机关党组织的下列三项任务：第一，加强党在机关中的政治思想工作。大会一致认为这是提高干部政治觉悟和工作能力的一个根本方法，同时是机关党组织作好一切工作的基础和前提。为了实现这项任务，党组织必须很好地领导党和非党干部进行理论、时事、政策以及文化的学习。在进行这些学习时，必须联系思想实际，切实解决思想中所存在的问题。第二，健全党的民主生活和民主制度。直属机关今后必须定期召开支部大会、总支大会以至机关干部的民主大会，开展批评和自我批评，给党和非党干部以充分发表意见和讨论问题的机会，以提高他们对党的工作的责任心、创造性。第三，建党，直属机关经过伟大的“三反”运动，已涌现出一大批积极分子。其中已有很多人申请入党。因此，直属机关的党组织应当按照上级党的方针，有计划、有准备、有领导地接收一批优秀分子入党。
