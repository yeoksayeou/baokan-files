    A Suggestion Regarding the Publication of the 1953 Almanac
    Comrade Editor: According to common perpetual calendars and Wu Yan Yu's "Hundred-Year Yin-Yang Calendar Comparison Table," the lunar month designations for June and July of 1953 are "June Small, July Large." However, the calendar summary sent by the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences states "June Large, July Small." This is because the conjunction of the first day of the seventh lunar month next year is at 00:10 on August 10th of the Gregorian calendar. The old almanacs place the first day of the seventh lunar month on August 9th of the Gregorian calendar, which is a miscalculation. We should follow the calculation of the Observatory and change it to "June Large, July Small."
    It's alright that natural calendar dates and social calendar dates occasionally don't match, as long as the national calendars are consistent. National public and private publishing houses, bookstores, and other enterprises should pay attention to this when compiling almanacs, "tongshu" (geomancy books), and monthly calendars. The vast rural population still uses the lunar calendar, and a one-day difference would have a negative impact (there have been precedents for this kind of error; probably in 1914 or 1915, there were two versions of the calendar, which divided the lunar December month designations, with some making it a large month and some a small month, resulting in some areas celebrating the New Year on different days).
    Furthermore, the solar eclipse on February 14th next year coincides with the first day of the first lunar month (partial solar eclipses will be visible on the morning of February 14, 1953, in the North China, Northeast China, East China, Central and South China, and Inner Mongolia regions of our country). This should also be publicized to the rural people so they know that solar eclipses are purely natural phenomena.

    关于出版一九五三年历书的一个建议
    编辑同志：一九五三年阴历六月和七月的月建，按一般万年历书及吴颜毓一百年阴阳历对照表都作“六月小，七月大”，而中国科学院紫金山天文台寄来的日历摘要则作“六月大，七月小”，这是因为明年阴历七月初一的合朔时分在阳历八月十日零时十分，而旧历书把七月初一放在阳历八月九日，实系推算错误，我们应该依照天文台的推算，改作“六月大，七月小”。
    自然月日和社会生活的月日偶不相符，只要全国历书趋于一致，便无问题。全国公私营出版社、书店以及其他企业部门在编历书、通书、月历时，应注意这一点。广大农村人民仍用阴历，如差了一天，影响就不太好（这种错误有过前例，大概在一九一四年或一九一五年，历书有两种版本，把阴历十二月的月建弄分歧了，有作月大的，有作月小的，以致某些地区这村和那村过的新年不在同一天）。
    又明年二月十四日日蚀，恰值正月初一日（我国华北、东北、华东、中南、内蒙各区在一九五三年二月十四日早晨都可看到日偏蚀）。这也应向农村人民进行宣传，使他们知道日蚀纯系自然现象。
