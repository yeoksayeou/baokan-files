    Letter to Qu Yaoli from Volunteer Army Recuperators Shi Xueqing et al.

    Comrade Qu Yaoli: We are wounded and sick soldiers from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army and have only recently come down from the front lines. Now, our health is gradually recovering, and we will soon be able to return to the front lines and fight the American devils alongside our comrades. This letter was written to you in a field hospital somewhere in Korea.

    Comrade, although we have never met, we do not feel like strangers. From the many magazines and pictorials sent from our motherland, we have become familiar with you and your exemplary deeds. You are the flag bearer on the cotton production front! For the sake of our motherland's common cause, we are closely linked together!

    There are thirteen comrades living in our ward, including commanders, combatants, political workers, and logistics personnel. No matter who they are, they all regard your exemplary deeds as a model for our study, and everyone shouts out the common slogan: "Learn from Comrade Qu Yaoli's patriotism!"

    Dear Comrade, we will recuperate in peace in the combat environment, strive to recover our health as soon as possible, and return to the front lines to strike at the enemy. May we achieve greater victories and successes on different fighting fronts for the safety and happiness of our motherland.

    Finally, we extend our cordial greetings and lofty respect to you. We wish you even greater achievements in this year's cotton production!

    Shi Xueqing, Jiang Shuyi, and thirteen other Volunteer Army recuperators from the First Ward of a field hospital somewhere in Korea

    志愿军休养员施学清等写给曲耀离的信
    曲耀离同志：我们是志愿军某部的伤病员，不久前才从前线下来的。现在，我们的身体已经逐渐恢复，很快就可以重返前线，和战友们一块打美国鬼子了。这封信，就是在朝鲜某地的一个野战医院里写给你的。
    同志，我们虽然没有见过面，但并不觉得陌生。从祖国运来的许多杂志和画报上，我们已经熟悉了你和你的模范事迹，你就是棉花生产战线上的旗手啊！我们为了祖国的共同事业，已经紧紧地连结在一起了！
    我们的病房里住着十三个同志。其中有指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员和后勤工作人员，不管什么人，都把你的模范事迹作为我们的学习榜样，大家喊出共同的口号：“学习曲耀离同志的爱国主义精神！”
    亲爱的同志，我们要在战斗的环境中安心休养，争取早日恢复健康，好重返前线打击敌人。愿我们在不同的斗争战线上，为着祖国的安全和幸福取得更大的胜利和成绩。
    最后，谨向你致以亲切的慰问和崇高的敬礼。预祝你在今年的棉花产量上获取更大的成就！
    朝鲜某地野战医院第一病房志愿军休养员施学清、姜树义等十三人
