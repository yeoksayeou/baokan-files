Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 29th: General Nam Il lodged a second written protest with Harrison on August 28 regarding the U.S. side killing five of our captured personnel and wounding sixty-four of our captured personnel this month. According to news leaking through the U.S. news blockade, the number of captured personnel killed by the U.S. side since August 11 has increased by four, and shooting incidents against captured personnel have increased to six. However, judging from the contradictory reports from the American and British news agencies, many details have not been disclosed.

The U.S. side has repeatedly suspended the armistice negotiations in the past three months, and behind this behavior is a trail of blood. The U.S. representatives have not provided a responsible account of the ongoing killings of North Korean and Chinese captured personnel that have occurred every month from February to August. Their task is to hypocritically tell the world that they cannot "send them back to die," while continuing to massacre North Korean and Chinese captured personnel.

General Nam Il demanded that Harrison provide a responsible account of the U.S. side's killings of captured personnel on Geoje Island and Jeju Island since August 11. Harrison did not answer a word and suggested another week-long recess—the fifth week-long recess. Because the U.S. side is attempting to stifle the negotiations with a long recess, the delegation conference has only met for two and a half hours this month. In the past four months, the U.S. representatives have exhausted all means to obstruct the realization of an armistice in Korea through negotiations.

At the last delegation conference, Harrison made no secret of the U.S. intention to overturn the agreements already reached—they want to do so in order to achieve Washington's goal of delaying negotiations and continuing the war. He said: Unless the North Korean and Chinese side accepts the U.S. proposal to detain North Korean and Chinese captured personnel—including 20 percent of North Korean POWs and 13,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs—"Paragraph 51 of the draft armistice agreement cannot reach a final agreement." In fact, the wording of Paragraph 51 of the draft armistice agreement was first proposed by the U.S. representative and then agreed to by General Nam Il.

After nearly fourteen months of negotiations, an unprecedented situation has emerged in Panmunjom this month. The draft armistice agreement has been agreed upon by both sides, but the U.S. representative refuses to sign the armistice agreement on the grounds that, for so-called "humanitarian" and "moral" reasons, they "cannot force prisoners of war to return to their country with bayonets." However, for several months, according to official U.S. reports, some Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war have been killed and wounded under the guns and bayonets of the United States because these prisoners of war resolutely want to return to their country. Because the U.S. representative refuses to let all prisoners of war go home, American, British, and other foreign prisoners of war have to stay abroad. American generals send hundreds of American, British, and other "allied" troops to the front lines to die every day. American planes continue to blatantly violate the Geneva Conventions, indiscriminately bombing Korean women and children.

Observers in Panmunjom clearly see that the purpose and result of Harrison's and Truman's high-sounding "humanitarianism" is nothing more than preventing the realization of an armistice in Korea, so that the Wall Street plutocrats can earn more and more blood-stained dollars.

### 美方一面拖延谈判一面屠杀我方被俘人员  证明美方高谈“人道”目的只是不要停战实现

    美方一面拖延谈判一面屠杀我方被俘人员
    证明美方高谈“人道”目的只是不要停战实现
    【新华社开城二十九日电】南日将军二十八日就美方在本月中打死我方被俘人员五人、打伤我方被俘人员六十四人一事向哈利逊提出第二次书面抗议。据从美方新闻封锁的缝隙中透出的消息说，八月十一日以来朝中被俘人员被杀害的人数增加了四人，枪击被俘人员事件增加到六次。但是从美英通讯社的矛盾纷纭的报道看来，还有许多细节没有公布。
    美方在过去三个月当中一再使停战谈判休会，这种行径背后是有着斑斑血迹的。美方代表没有对从二月至八月中间的每个月中不断发生的屠杀朝中被俘人员的事件作负责的交代。他们的任务是一面假惺惺地对全世界说他们不能“放他们回去送死”，一面继续屠杀朝中被俘人员。
    南日将军要求哈利逊对八月十一日以来美方屠杀巨济岛和济州岛上被俘人员的情况作负责的交代。哈利逊一句话也没有回答，就建议再休会一星期——这是第五次为时一星期的休会。由于美方企图用长期休会来扼杀谈判，使得代表团大会在本月中只开了两个半小时的会。在过去四个月当中，美方代表已耍尽一切手段，以阻挠用谈判来实现朝鲜的停战。
    在上次代表团大会上，哈利逊毫不隐讳美方想推翻已经获得的协议的意图——他们想这样做是为了实现华盛顿拖延谈判、继续进行战争的目的。他说：除非朝中方面接受美方所提的扣留朝中被俘人员——包括百分之二十的北朝鲜籍战俘和一万三千名中国人民志愿军战俘——的要求，否则“停战协议草案第五十一款是不能取得最后协议的”。其实停战协议草案第五十一款的措词是先由美方代表提出后得南日将军同意的。
    经过将近十四个月的谈判以后，本月板门店出现了一种人们从未见过的局面。停战协议草案已得双方同意，可是美方代表拒绝签订停战协议，理由是他们基于所谓“人道”和“道义”的理由“不能用刺刀尖逼迫战俘回国”。但是几个月以来，据美方正式报告，每月都有一些朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战俘在美国的枪口和刺刀之下被杀死和杀伤，原因是这些战俘坚决要回国。由于美方代表不肯让全部战俘回家，美国、英国以及其他外国的战俘只好留在国外。美国将军们天天派成百的美国、英国以及其他“盟国”的军队到前线去送死。美国飞机继续公然破坏日内瓦公约，滥炸朝鲜妇女和儿童。
    板门店的观察家们看得很清楚，哈利逊和杜鲁门高谈“人道”的目的和结果不是别的，只是不要朝鲜停战实现，好让华尔街的财阀们挣更多更多的染满鲜血的美元。
