Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th -- News: Statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry show that Japan still has a large amount of land sufficient for the vast number of landless or land-poor peasants to cultivate. The crux of the problem lies solely in the fact that Japanese feudal forces are occupying this land, forcing peasants to concentrate on a small amount of cultivated land. The Yoshida government often uses "large population, small land area" as a pretext to incite militaristic, aggressive thought among the Japanese people. However, the statistical materials of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry expose the Yoshida government's outrageous lies to deceive the Japanese peasants. According to the Japanese "Agricultural Cooperative News," the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry admits that, with current Japanese agricultural technology, the land that can be converted into arable land amounts to 3.64 million cho (one cho is approximately 15 Chinese mu) in Honshu and 1.86 million cho in Hokkaido, totaling 5.5 million cho, exceeding the current total area of cultivated land in Japan. If this large amount of land could be distributed to the 4.5 million peasant households who currently have less than one cho of land for free cultivation, it could produce at least 27 million koku of grain (one koku is equivalent to 1.8 Chinese dou). In this way, Japan would no longer need to import foreign rice at a high price.

    日本封建势力霸占大量土地广大无地少地农民缺少耕地
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：日本农林省的统计表明，日本目前还有大量的土地足供广大无地或少地的农民耕种。问题的症结仅在于日本的封建势力霸占着这些土地，迫使农民集中在少量的耕地上。吉田政府常以“人口众多，土地狭小”为藉口，在日本煽动军国主义的侵略思想。但是，农林省的统计材料，暴露了吉田政府欺骗日本农民的漫天大谎。据日本“农业共济新闻”报道，农林省承认，以目前日本农业技术能改为耕地的土地，本州有三百六十四万町步（每町步约合十五市亩）、北海道有一百八十六万町步，共计五百五十万町步，超过日本目前耕地的总面积。这些大量的土地如果能分给现在土地数量不满一町步的四百五十万户农民自由耕种，最低限度能增产粮食二千七百万日石（一日石合中国制一石八斗），这样，日本就可以不必再以昂贵的代价去输入外国大米。
