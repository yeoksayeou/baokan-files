Red Ninth Company All Comrades Petition Chairman Mao
Reporting the Great Achievements of the Company's Intensive Cultural Studies

Respected Chairman Mao: We have mastered the weapon of the "Rapid Literacy Method" and launched a fierce attack on the "cultural bunker." After the Party branch's call and the mobilization of superiors, the learning enthusiasm of all comrades in the company was extremely high, and a fighting atmosphere of learning grew in the company. In the intense study life, Party members actively took the lead. Party member Mei Zhenghong had a large sore on his leg, and comrades carried him to class every day. Sometimes his wound was so painful that he bit his teeth and tied his leg to listen to the lecture. When the instructor advised him to rest, he said excitedly: "A good soldier of Mao Zedong can endure any pain. Can't I study just because I have a sore?" He still participated in the study with a tenacious spirit of intensive learning. The model cooking class with a glorious tradition, in their tense work, used the method of "seizing every opportunity" to ensure three hours of study every day. The comrades in the cooking class held words in their hands and recited them whether they were carrying water, cooking, or stoking the fire, not letting go of any time. The company has already set off a learning upsurge of challenging and competing for the red flag, and launched a contract system and a movement to find objects for contracted teaching and learning. We have been studying for fourteen days and have already seen progress. Comrades who used to recognize about 400 characters now recognize more than 2,000 characters and can read popular books and newspapers and write short articles. Most of the semi-literate people who used to recognize very few characters now also recognize more than 1,000 characters. The entire company has basically eliminated illiteracy. Everyone felt particularly happy and decided to write to you to report the good news.

Respected Chairman Mao! We guarantee not to be proud or arrogant, to study with an open mind, to strive for greater victories in the writing stage, to work hard to rapidly improve culture, build a strong national defense force, and always be your good soldiers. Red Ninth Company All Comrades

    红九连全体同志上书毛主席
    报告连队突击学习文化的巨大成绩
    敬爱的毛主席：我们掌握了“速成识字法”的武器，向“文化碉堡”进行了猛烈的进攻。经过党支部的号召和上级的动员，全连同志的学习情绪极其高涨，连队里生长了一种战斗的学习空气。在紧张的学习生活中，党员们都能积极带头。党员梅正宏腿上生了一个很大的疮，每天由同志们背着去上课，有时他的疮口痛得难受，他就咬住牙把腿绑住来听课。教员劝他去休息，他激动地说：“毛泽东的好战士什么痛苦都能忍受，难道我生了一个疮就不能学习吗？”他仍然以顽强的突击精神来参加学习。有着光荣传统的模范炊事班，在紧张的工作中，利用“钻空子”的办法，保证每天学习三小时。炊事班的同志们不管在抬水、煮饭或烧火时，都拿着生字念，一点时间都不放过。连里已经掀起了挑战和争夺红旗的学习热潮，并开展了包干制和找对象的包教保学运动。我们学习了十四天，已经看到了进步。过去认识四百字左右的同志，现在都认识两千个字以上了，能够看通俗的书报和写短文了。过去识字很少的半文盲，现在也大部认识了一千多字。全连基本上消灭了文盲。大家感到特别高兴，决定向您写信报喜。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们保证不骄不傲，虚心学习，在写字写话阶段中争取更大的胜利，为迅速提高文化，建设强大的国防军而努力，永远作您的好战士。  红九连全体同志
