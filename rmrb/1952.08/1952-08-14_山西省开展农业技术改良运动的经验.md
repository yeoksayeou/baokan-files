    Experiences in Shanxi Province's Agricultural Technology Improvement Movement
    Wang Pixu
    Shanxi Province's agricultural technology improvement movement began in 1950, based on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and driven by the continuous demands of the broad masses of farmers to improve agricultural production. In 1951, the area planted with improved grain seeds reached 15.28% of the province's total grain sowing area; the area planted with improved cotton seeds reached 15% of the total cotton planting area, and this year it has rapidly increased to 65.81%. Seed disinfection has been implemented in many areas. In 1951, more than 10,000 new-style farm tools were promoted, and in 1952, it is planned to promote 31,610 pieces, with 18,913 pieces promoted in the spring alone. Much progress has also been made in land preparation, water conservancy construction, and soil improvement. The experiences of the past two years have proven that improving agricultural technology is one of the fundamental factors in increasing agricultural production; it is also a major driving force in enriching the content of mutual aid organizations, making them more consolidated and improved.
    I. Organizing an Agricultural Technology Extension Network is the Best Way to Carry out the Technology Improvement Movement
    The experiences of the past two years have proven that forming an agricultural technology extension network with farms as the leadership, rural technical committees as the core, and agricultural mutual aid teams as the foundation, is the best way to universally carry out the technology improvement movement.
    (1) In order to give play to the leading role of state-owned farms in technology extension work, we have put forward the principle of "relying on work within the farm to guide work outside the farm." State-owned farms must do a good job within the farm to influence the masses with examples of increased production, and then establish mass-based technology extension organizations through training, exhibitions, visits, and other activities, so that science and technology can take root among the masses. Shanxi has a total of one hundred farms, and seventy farms have basically implemented this principle. In 1951, we specifically calculated the production volume of fifty-seven farms. The average yield of wheat per mu on these farms exceeded the mass yield by 16.7%, millet exceeded by 30.2%, corn exceeded by 49.1%, sorghum exceeded by 16.1%, and cotton exceeded by 20% to 25%; the average total yield of various crops exceeded the masses by about 20%. The high yields of the farms educated the farmers and made them realize that to achieve high yields, technology must be improved. Many farmers who visited the farms unanimously reflected: "Catch up with the farms, learn from the farms." In terms of guiding work outside the farm, the farms generally adopted the following methods: (1) Holding specialized training classes to cultivate the backbone of technology extension. In 1951, farms in 37 counties including Gaoping, Fenyang, Guoxian, Yongji, and Zhaocheng, held a total of 73 specialized training classes, training more than 24,900 people. In 1952, farms in 35 counties including Changzhi, Linfen, Yuci, Guoxian, and Yuxiang, trained more than 8,340 people in the spring alone. The effect of this specialized training is very good. The Yuncheng Special District Farm held a training class on dense planting of cotton, promoting Qu Yaoli's experience in dense planting of cotton. As a result, most of the more than 2 million mu of cotton in the entire special district implemented dense planting. (2) Implementing the method of combining training and instruction to promote new technologies. This spring, in order to universally promote new-style farm tools, the Yushe County Farm drew more than 20 cadres from various departments, trained them, and formed a promotion team, carrying step plows to 13 technology instruction stations to impart technology. As a result, more than 3,000 farmers learned to use new-style step plows. In the process of imparting technology, a total of 210 new-style step plows were promoted. This spring, the Yangqu County Farm trained more than 2,780 people, and established more than 30 technology instruction stations, more than 100 rural technology committees, and 35 small farms throughout the county, forming an agricultural technology extension network. In the process of imparting scientific and technological knowledge, a total of more than 60,000 jin of various improved seeds, more than 4,700 jin of scientific agents, and more than 300 new-style step plows were promoted. The technology instruction station has truly become a bridge for disseminating technology between the government, state-owned farms, rural technology committees, and mutual aid teams, which is conducive to the promotion of science and technology. Some counties in the province have established more than 240 technology instruction stations, imparting new technologies to more than 300,000 people. (3) Organizing exhibitions and visits to educate the masses with examples. Last year, 23 farms including Huguan held a total of 65 exhibitions, with more than 44,000 visitors. The Yushe County Farm organized a new-style farm tool experimental exhibition at the Chengguan livestock market, and the audience reached more than 5,000 people in five days. Some farms set up propaganda sheds at market town temple fairs, promoting and exhibiting at the same time, which also achieved great results. (4) State-owned farms and small farms of mutual aid teams are combined to carry out joint trials and joint promotion. Last year, 72 farms promoted more than 10.66 million jin of various improved varieties such as cotton, wheat, millet, and corn, and more than 5,800 new-style farm tools; most of these things were first promoted to mutual aid teams, and adaptive trials were carried out in the small farms within the mutual aid teams; after the trials were successful, they were massively reproduced and promoted from the seed plots. Some farms in the Changzhi Special District have signed joint trial contracts with the masses. The farms guarantee technical guidance and material supply to the mutual aid teams, and the masses accept the guidance of the farms. This method also has a great effect on increasing production. (5) Establishing letter connections. Many farms have established communication relationships with mutual aid teams, rural technology committees, and veteran technical farmers, studying technical issues with each other. The Wuxiang Farm established communication relationships with 400 rural technology committees, mutual aid teams, and veteran technical farmers, answering technical questions raised by the masses. This spring, the Yushe Farm received many letters from farmers with insects in the envelopes, asking the farm to identify them and introduce treatment methods. (6) Establishing promotion zones led by special personnel from the farm. This method has been adopted in some areas. The Nanshidian Promotion Zone in Jincheng was established in 1950 and has now expanded to 13 administrative villages. More than 2,000 technical talents have been trained in the promotion zone, and the promotion of improved varieties has reached more than 90% of the cultivated land area; techniques such as soaking and mixing seeds and selecting seeds have also been widely adopted by the masses. The advantage of this method is that the promotion work is concentrated in one area, it is easy to master the technology, and it is also convenient to create experience, and to play the role of creating typical examples to guide the general. State-owned farms in various parts of Shanxi have used the above methods to promote science and technology, giving play to the leading role of the farms, combining science and technology with the experience of the broad masses of farmers, and further strengthening the relationship between the farms and the masses, creating conditions for a larger-scale technology improvement movement.
    (2) We must give play to the core role of rural technology committees. Rural technology committees are established under the leadership of the government and state-owned farms. This year, 7,123 technical committees have been established in 70 counties. Rural technology committees are generally composed of village cadres, labor models, and experienced veteran farmers. Its core role is mainly reflected in two aspects: on the one hand, it is to accept the scientific and technological knowledge of state-owned farms and spread it to the masses; on the other hand, it is to summarize the experience of farmers and use the experience of farmers to guide farmers' production. The basis for rural technical committees to spread technology is the mutual aid team, and the following methods are used to spread technology: one is that the technical committee absorbs the mutual aid team leader or the technician of the mutual aid team to participate in research work, researching and promoting at any time. The other is that the technical committee, in conjunction with experienced veteran farmers, organizes several technical groups (such as seeders, plowmen, fertilizer application, seed soaking and mixing, seed selection, etc.), adopts a method of professional division of labor, and conducts technical guidance. The advantage of this form is that the division of labor is strict, it is convenient to concentrate research, and it can improve specialized technology. This form is most commonly used in old areas such as Changzhi and Yushe. Another method is that the technical committee uses blackboard newspapers and discussion meetings to conduct general technical publicity according to the agricultural season. This method is more common in new areas with poor mutual aid foundation.
    (3) Technology extension work must be based on mutual aid teams. Organized farmers, concentrated land, concentrated resources, and concentrated wisdom, make it easy to adopt new agricultural technologies, so they can fully exert the role of technology in increasing agricultural production. There are about 300,000 mutual aid teams in Shanxi Province, and about 60% of the teams have been combined with technology improvement. Some mutual aid teams have established "small farms" and "seed plots"; small farms are used for adaptive trials, and seed plots are used for reproduction and promotion. Last year, 612 small farms were established in 69 counties including Fenyang, Xiangling, and Wenxi, with a land area of more than 3,000 mu. With the improvement of mutual aid teams, there are more small farms this year, and it is estimated that there are at least more than 10,000. Last year, there were more than 56,000 mu of seed plots in mutual aid teams in 49 counties including Fanshi. Now, mutual aid teams in old areas with a good working foundation generally have seed plots. According to the inspection, the practice of establishing small farms and seed plots has been very effective. The Guo Yu'en mutual aid team in Chuandi Village, Pingshun (the Guo Yu'en mutual aid team was merged with the Guo Xiaoyou mutual aid team in the spring of 1951 to form an agricultural production cooperative) has a total of 14 mu of seed plots. The varieties cultivated in the past two years have been popularized throughout the village. Farmers attach great importance to the seed plots. They said: "The seed plots are schools for our farmers to cultivate seeds!" Some mutual aid teams have adopted the method of teachers teaching apprentices, learning while teaching and promoting at the same time. This method is mostly used in women's mutual aid teams. In order to learn technology, they hire veteran farmers as teachers, learning what they do, learning and promoting at the same time. This method is not as perfect as the first one, and it is still a minority in Shanxi.
    II. Several Issues That Urgently Need to be Resolved in Carrying out the Agricultural Technology Improvement Movement
    (1) We must strengthen the work of state-owned farms. With the development of rural production, farmers' demands for improving agricultural technology are becoming more and more urgent, especially after the widespread development of rural technology networks, which requires more leadership from the farms. However, at present, 30% of the farms in the province are still unable to play their due role in technology extension work due to the lack of necessary material conditions and technical personnel. Therefore, governments at all levels must attach importance to the construction of farms, so that farms can play a leading and exemplary role in the technology improvement movement, and better lead farmers to improve production.
    (2) Strengthening the education of farmers and overcoming the conservative ideas of farmers are prerequisites for carrying out a mass technology improvement movement. At present, the idea of "not planting 100 mu of land, not harvesting 100 shi of grain" still exists seriously among the masses. Under the control of this idea, they focus more on increasing the land area and are unwilling to work hard on technology. Some people believe that "production has reached the top" and it is useless to talk about technology. Therefore, we must adopt the methods of establishing typical examples and demonstration education to gradually overcome the conservative ideas of farmers, so that the technology improvement movement can be carried out more universally.
    (3) Strengthen technical education for cadres. At present, many cadres still have a tendency to underestimate technology. They believe that "if politics is good, technical work will naturally be good." They do not study technology well, but blindly promote technology, so problems have occurred in promotion work in many areas. In 1951, Fenyang County blindly promoted 4-198 sorghum, which resulted in a yield lower than the local sorghum level, causing dissatisfaction among farmers. In the future, we must strengthen the technical education of cadres through training or temporary instruction to overcome the above deviations, so that the technology improvement movement can be carried out smoothly.

    山西省开展农业技术改良运动的经验
    王丕绪
    山西省的农业技术改良运动，从一九五零年开始，在互助合作组织的基础上，在广大农民继续提高农业生产的要求下开展起来。一九五一年种植优良谷物种籽的面积已达全省粮食播种总面积的百分之十五点二八；种植棉花优良种籽的面积已达植棉总面积的百分之十五，今年迅速增长到百分之六十五点八一。许多地区已经实行了种籽消毒。一九五一年推广了一万多件新式农具，一九五二年计划推广三万一千六百一十件，仅春季就推广了一万八千九百一十三件。在土地加工、兴修水利、改良土壤等方面，也作出了许多成绩。两年来的经验证明，改良农业技术是提高农业生产的基本因素之一；也是充实互助组织的内容，使互助组织得到巩固和提高的一个重大的动力。
    一、组织农业技术推广网是开展技术改良运动的最好方法
    两年来的经验证明：以农场为领导、农村技术委员会为核心、农业互助组为基础组成农业技术推广网，是普遍开展技术改良运动的最好方法。
    （一）为了发挥国营农场在技术推广工作上的领导作用，我们提出了“依托场内工作，指导场外工作”的方针。国营农场必须作好场内工作，以增产的实例影响群众，然后通过训练、展览、参观等活动，建立起群众性的技术推广组织，使科学技术在群众中生根。山西共有一百个农场，已有七十个农场基本上贯彻了这个方针。一九五一年我们具体统计了五十七个农场的生产量，这些农场的小麦每亩平均超过群众产量百分之十六点七，谷子超过百分之三十点二，玉米超过百分之四十九点一，高粱超过百分之十六点一，棉花超过百分之二十到二十五；各种作物总平均产量超过群众百分之二十左右。农场的丰产教育了农民，使他们认识了要丰产必须提高技术。不少农民参观了农场后，一致反映：“向农场看齐，向农场学习。”在指导场外工作方面，各农场一般的采取了以下几种方法：（1）举办专题训练班，培养推广技术的骨干。一九五一年高平、汾阳、崞县、永济、赵城等三十七县的农场，共计举办了七十三次专题训练班，训练了二万四千九百多人。一九五二年长治、临汾、榆次、崞县、虞乡等三十五县的农场，仅在春季就训练了八千三百四十多人。这种专题训练的效果很好。运城专区农场举办了棉花密植训练班，推广曲耀离棉花密植经验，结果全专区二百多万亩棉花，大部实行了密植。（2）实行训练和传授相结合的推广新技术的方法。今年春天，榆社县农场为了普遍推广新式农具，从各部门抽调了二十多个干部，加以训练，组成推广队，携带步犁，到十三个技术传授站传授技术，结果使三千多个农民学会使用新式步犁。在传授技术过程中，共推广新式步犁二百一十张。今年春天，阳曲县农场训练了二千七百八十多人，在全县建立了三十多个技术传授站，一百多个农村技术委员会，三十五个小农场，组成农业技术推广网。在传授科学技术的过程中，共推广了各种优良种籽六万多斤，科学药剂四千七百多斤，新式步犁三百多部。技术传授站真正变成了政府、国营农场和农村技术委员会、互助组间传播技术的桥梁，有利于科学技术的推广。全省一部分县已经建立了二百四十多个技术传授站，把新技术传授给三十多万人。（3）组织展览、参观，以实例教育群众。去年壶关等二十三个农场共举办了六十五次展览会，参观人数四万四千多人。榆社县农场在城关骡马大会上，组织了新式农具实验展览，五天时间观众达五千余人。有的农场在集镇庙会设立宣传棚，一面宣传，一面展览，收效也很大。（4）国营农场和互助组的小农场结合起来，实行联合试验、联合推广。去年七十二个农场推广棉花、小麦、谷子、玉米等各种优良品种一千零六十六万多斤、新式农具五千八百多部；这些东西大部是先推广到互助组，在互助组内的小农场作适应试验；试验成功后，再从留种地内大量繁殖推广。长治专区有些农场和群众订立了联合试验合同，农场保证对互助组进行技术指导和物资供应，群众接受农场的指导。这种作法对增产作用也很大。（5）建立信件连系。很多农场和互助组、农村技术委员会、技术老农等建立了通讯关系，相互研究技术问题。武乡农场和四百个农村技术委员会、互助组及技术老农建立了通讯关系，答复群众提出的技术上的难题。榆社农场在今年春天收到许多农民来信，信封内装着虫子，请农场加以识别，和介绍治法。（6）建立推广区，由农场派专人领导。这种方法，已有部分地区开始采用。晋城南石店推广区，从一九五○年开始建立，现已扩大到十三个行政村。推广区内现已培养了二千个以上的技术人材，推广的优良品种达到了耕地面积百分之九十以上；浸拌种、选种等技术，群众也已普遍采用了。这种方法的优点是：推广工作集中在一个地区，容易掌握技术，也便于创造经验，发挥创造典型指导一般的作用。山西各地国营农场运用上述各种办法推广科学技术，发挥了农场的领导作用，使科学技术和广大农民的经验相结合，进一步密切了农场和群众的关系，为更大规模的技术改良运动创造了条件。
    （二）必须发挥农村技术委员会的核心作用。农村技术委员会是在政府和国营农场领导下建立起来的。今年七十个县已经建立了七千一百二十三个技术委员会。农村技术委员会一般是由村干部、劳动模范、技术好的老农共同组成的。它的核心作用，主要表现在两方面：一方面是接受国营农场的科学技术，并把它传播到群众中去；另一方面是总结农民的经验，以农民的经验来指导农民生产。农村技术委员会传播技术的基础是互助组，采用以下几种方法传播技术：一种是技术委员会吸收互助组长或互助组的技术员参加研究工作，随时研究、随时推广。另一种是技术委员会结合有经验的老农，组织若干技术小组（如摇耧、掌犁、施肥、浸拌种、选种等），采取专业分工的方法，进行技术指导。这种形式的优点是分工严密、便于集中研究，能提高专门性质的技术。这种形式在长治、榆社等老区采用得最为普遍。还有一种方法是技术委员会按农事季节运用黑板报、座谈会进行一般的技术宣传。这种办法在互助基础不好的新区采用较多。
    （三）技术推广工作必须以互助组为基础。组织起来的农民，土地集中了，资力集中了，智慧集中了，便于采用新的农业技术，因此能充分发挥技术对农业增产的作用。山西全省约有三十万个互助组，其中百分之六十左右的组已和提高技术相结合。有些互助组建立了“小农场”、“留种地”；小农场作适应性的试验，“留种地”供繁殖推广。去年汾阳、襄陵、闻喜等六十九县共建立了六百一十二个小农场，土地面积达三千余亩。随着互助组的提高，今年小农场更多了，估计最少也在一万个以上。去年繁峙等四十九县的互助组内已有五万六千多亩留种地。现在在工作基础好的老区的互助组，一般都有了留种地。根据检查设立小农场和留种地的作法收效很大。平顺川底村郭玉恩互助组（郭玉恩互助组在一九五一年春已和郭小有互助组合并组成农业生产合作社）共有十四亩留种地，二年来培养出的品种已普及全村，农民对留种地十分重视，他们说：“留种地是咱们农民培养种籽的学校！”有些互助组采用了老师教徒弟，边教边学边推广的办法。这种办法多用于妇女互助组。她们为了学习技术，聘请老农当老师，作什么学什么，随学随推广。这种办法不如第一种完善，在山西采用的还是少数。
    二、在开展农业技术改良运动中急须解决的几个问题
    （一）必须加强国营农场的工作。随着农村生产的发展，农民对改进农业技术的要求也日益迫切了，特别是农村技术网普遍发展起来以后，更需要农场加以领导。但目前全省仍有百分之三十的农场由于缺乏必要的物质条件和技术人员，在技术推广工作上还不能发挥应有的作用。因此，各级政府必须重视农场建设工作，使农场在技术改良运动中能发挥带头示范作用，更好地带领农民提高生产。
    （二）加强对农民的教育，克服农民的保守思想，是开展群众性技术改良运动的先决条件。目前“种不上百亩地，打不下百石粮”的思想，在群众中仍然严重地存在着。在这种思想支配之下，他们多从增加土地面积上着眼，不肯从技术上下功夫。有些人认为“生产已到了顶”再讲技术也不行。因此，必须采用树立典型、示范教育的方法，逐渐克服农民中的保守思想，才能使技术改良运动更普遍地开展起来。
    （三）加强对干部的技术教育。目前许多干部还存在着轻视技术的倾向，他们认为“政治好了技术工作自然会好”，他们不好好学习技术，而盲目地推广技术，因此不少地区在推广工作中发生了问题。一九五一年汾阳县因盲目推广四——一九八高粱，使产量低于当地高粱水平，引起农民的不满。今后必须通过训练或临时传授等办法，加强对干部的技术教育，克服上述偏向，才能顺利地开展技术改良运动。
