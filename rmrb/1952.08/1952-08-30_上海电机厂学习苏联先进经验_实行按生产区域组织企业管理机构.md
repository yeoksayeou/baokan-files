The state-owned Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, learning from the advanced Soviet experience of organizing enterprise management structures by production area, has successfully carried out organizational reforms. Over the past ten months, the total number of personnel has only doubled, while the total output value has increased more than fivefold; the production cycle of products has generally been shortened by 50% to 70%; production planning has been greatly strengthened, and the entire plant's daily production progress can be fully understood by the next morning. The East China Military and Administrative Committee's Industrial Department is now calling on the leaders of all factories and mining enterprises under its jurisdiction to universally study and promote this experience as an important task for current production reform.

Before the reform of the production management structure, the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant followed the old production management methods and unreasonable labor organization of the former bureaucratic capitalist enterprises, and the production situation was very chaotic, with many defective products and rework repairs. In May of last year, 140 small motor rotors were made defective, and in July of last year, the number of motors returned for rework accounted for 40% of the total monthly output. Machines could not be coordinated, technical problems could not be resolved in time, and production disconnects such as work stoppages waiting for materials were very serious, so that many workers often had nothing to do at the beginning of the month while waiting for drawings, tools, blanks, and materials, but at the end of the month they had to work overtime day and night to rush to complete tasks. This phenomenon naturally increased defective and rework products, and raised costs. The management personnel were also very distressed, running around all day, urging semi-finished products, and rushing tasks, extremely busy.

In order to develop production, last September, the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant Party Committee, on the basis of checking the waste movement, and according to the advanced Soviet experience of organizing enterprise management structures by production area, carried out the following organizational reforms, targeting the shortcomings of the original organization: First, the original method of dividing workshops and groups according to technological process was changed to dividing workshops according to production objects, that is, finished products, and dividing groups according to semi-finished products; the machines needed to manufacture a certain product were all concentrated in one workshop or group. In this way, the phenomenon that each semi-finished product often went through two or more groups or workshops for repeated construction, causing production disconnects, was overcome. Second, the production area system was implemented, with the factory director directly leading the workshops, and the original "office" level organizations (such as the manufacturing office, etc.) were abolished. This changed the past phenomenon of multiple leadership in workshops and mutual shirking of responsibility when problems arose. In addition, functional sections were established to make each functional section (including technology, planning, production, etc.) a staff department for the factory director to lead production activities. Workshops also set up functional groups, which were directly led by the workshop director and given business guidance by the functional sections. This ensured the integrity of the workshop's work and facilitated the implementation of the economic accounting system in the workshop.

However, in the process of implementing this production organization reform, the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant encountered various ideological obstacles. For example, some people believed that dividing workshops and groups according to production objects had some meaning of "large contracting, small contracting" and violated the principles of scientific division of labor; some believed that since it was a "contracting" nature, quality would inevitably be ignored; some were afraid that there would not be enough equipment to allocate or that it could not be fully utilized after allocation; some were afraid that without "all-round" grassroots leading cadres, the work would not be done well. The root cause of these ideas was mainly "conservative thinking," and not knowing that relying on the masses is the basic method for running state-owned enterprises well. They were accustomed to the management methods of British and American capitalist enterprises and took a skeptical attitude towards advanced Soviet experience. After more than ten months of practice, the iron facts have reversed the wrong views of these personnel. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 上海电机厂学习苏联先进经验  实行按生产区域组织企业管理机构

    上海电机厂学习苏联先进经验
    实行按生产区域组织企业管理机构
    国营上海电机厂学习苏联按生产区域组织企业管理机构的先进经验，进行组织改革工作，获得成功。十个多月来，全厂人员仅增加一倍，而生产总值却增加了五倍以上；产品的生产周期一般地缩短了百分之五十到七十；生产计划性大大加强，全厂每日的生产进度，第二天早上就能全部了解。现华东军政委员会工业部正号召所属各厂矿企业领导人普遍学习与推广这一经验，作为当前生产改革的重要工作。
    在未进行生产管理机构改革之前，上海电机厂沿袭着过去官僚资本企业一套旧的生产管理方法和不合理的劳动组织，生产情况非常混乱，存在着废品多、返工退修多的现象。去年五月份小型马达的转子就做坏了一百四十只，去年七月份返工退修的马达只数占全月生产总数的百分之四十。机器不能配合，技术问题不能及时解决，停工待料等生产脱节现象非常严重，以致往往有很多工人月初等待图样、工具、毛坯、材料而没工可做，到了月底却又日夜加班加点，进行突击。这种现象自然就增加了废品和退修品，提高了成本。管理人员也很苦恼，整天奔东跑西，催半制品，赶任务，忙得不可开交。
    为了发展生产，去年九月，中共上海电机厂党委会在检查浪费运动的基础上，根据苏联按生产区域组织企业管理机构的先进经验，针对原有组织的缺点，进行了如下的组织改革工作：首先，把原来按工艺技术划分车间和小组的办法，改为按生产对象就是按成品划分车间，按半成品划分小组的办法；把制造某一种制品所需要的机器，都集中在一个车间或小组里。这样，就克服了过去每一个半成品常常经过两个以上的小组或车间往复施工，造成生产脱节的现象。其次，实行生产区域制的组织制度，由厂长直接领导车间，取消原有“室”（如制造室等）一级组织。改变了过去车间多头领导、有事互相推诿的无人负责现象。另外，成立职能科，使各个职能科（包括技术、计划、生产等）成为厂长领导生产活动的参谋部。车间同样设立各职能组，由车间主任直接领导，由职能科分别进行业务指导。这样就保证了车间工作的完整性，也便于车间实行经济核算制。
    但是，上海电机厂在实行这一生产组织改革的过程中，曾遇到了各种思想障碍，如部分人员认为按生产对象划分车间和小组，有些“大包工、小包工”的意味，违背科学分工的原理；有的认为既然是“包工”性质，必然会忽视品质；有的怕设备不够分配或者分配后不能充分利用；有的怕没有“全能”的基层领导干部，工作会搞不好。产生这些思想的根源，主要是“保守思想”，不知道依靠群众是办好国营企业的基本方法。他们习惯于英、美资本主义企业的管理方式，对于苏联的先进经验则采取怀疑态度。经过十个多月来的实践，铁的事实扭转了这些人员的错误观点。　（新华社）
