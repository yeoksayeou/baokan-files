Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: TASS, Pyongyang, 15th - A grand meeting was held in Pyongyang to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Korea from the shackles of Japanese imperialism.

    Attending the meeting were advanced workers, heroes of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, representatives of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Korean scientists, artists, representatives of various parties and public organizations, and members of diplomatic missions.

    On the rostrum hung huge portraits of Stalin, Kim Il Sung, and Mao Zedong, decorated with flowers. A banner written in gold letters read: "Long Live the Seventh Anniversary of the Great Soviet Liberation of Korea." The presidium of the meeting consisted of Kim Il Sung, Park Hon Yong, Hong Ki Ju, Heo Ga-i, Park Jeong Ae, Park Chang Ok, Choi Yong Kun, and Soviet Ambassador to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Razuvayev.

    Kim Il Sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, delivered a report at the meeting.

    In his lengthy speech, Kim Il Sung pointed out that the Soviet Army's liberation of Korea from the colonial oppression of Japanese imperialism opened a new page in the history of the Korean people. Seven years ago, for the first time in their long history, the Korean people had the opportunity to build their own lives. Kim Il Sung praised the Soviet Army for not only giving the Korean people the freedom they had long desired after liberating Korea but also paving the way for the development of a unified, independent, free, and democratic country. He said that the Korean people deeply appreciate and love their liberator and best friend – the Soviet people and the great Stalin.

    Speaking about the Fatherland Liberation War, Kim Il Sung pointed out that after the American interventionists suffered not only military but also political defeats on the front lines, they committed heinous crimes in Korea. They used chemical and bacteriological weapons, bombed peaceful cities, villages, and power plants, and barbarously bombed residential areas in an attempt to destroy Korean civilians.

    Kim Il Sung said: However, no atrocities can make the freedom-loving Korean people yield. The fighting strength of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting alongside them is growing stronger and stronger; they are an invincible army. The ranks of the guerrillas fighting heroically in southern Korea are also growing stronger and stronger. The strength of the rear areas of the Republic is increasing day by day; workers, peasants, and intellectuals, in fact, the entire people, are working selflessly under the slogan "Everything for the front, everything for victory."

    Kim Il Sung continued: The Korean people want peace. Our delegation at Panmunjom has taken all measures to achieve a truce agreement. However, the American side is talking about peace on the one hand and actually sabotaging the negotiations and expanding the war on the other.

    In conclusion, Kim Il Sung expressed the determination of the entire Korean people to win victory in this just Fatherland Liberation War against the American aggressors, to defend their democratic achievements, and to defend their freedom and independence.

    Kim Il Sung's speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause, which was the audience's tribute to Korea's liberator – the Soviet Army, the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Korean peoples, a tribute to Kim Il Sung, Mao Zedong, and a tribute to the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.

    Next, Soviet Ambassador to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Razuvayev, delivered a speech in which he extended warm and heartfelt greetings to the Korean people on behalf of the Soviet people.

    The representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers presented a banner of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the fraternal Korean People's Army. The Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Korea and the heads of diplomatic missions of various people's democratic countries also delivered congratulatory messages.

    The conference passed with great enthusiasm telegrams of greetings to Marshal Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, and General Kim Il Sung.

    平壤隆重纪念朝鲜解放七周年
    金日成将军演说决在抗美战争中取得胜利
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社平壤十五日讯：平壤举行了一次隆重的大会，纪念苏军从日本帝国主义者的桎梏下解放朝鲜的七周年。
    参加大会的有先进的工人、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的英雄、中国人民志愿军指战员代表、朝鲜科学家、艺术工作者、各党派和公共团体的代表以及外交使团人员。
    主席台上悬挂着斯大林、金日成和毛泽东的巨大画像，像框上饰以鲜花。一幅用金字写着的标语是：“伟大的苏联解放朝鲜七周年万岁”。大会主席团由金日成、朴宪永、洪箕畴、许嘉谊、朴正爱、朴昌玉、崔镛健和苏联驻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国大使拉佐瓦耶夫组成。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首相兼朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成在会上作了报告。
    金日成在他的长篇演说里指出：苏军使朝鲜从日本帝国主义者的殖民压迫下得到解放，这在朝鲜人民历史中揭开了新的一页。七年前，朝鲜人民在他们的悠久历史中第一次得到建立他们自己的生活的机会。金日成赞扬苏军在解放朝鲜后，不仅给予朝鲜人民长久以来所渴望的自由，而且开辟了走向发展一个单一的、独立的、自由的和民主的国家的道路。他说，朝鲜人民深切感激和热爱他们的解放者和最好的朋友——苏联人民和伟大的斯大林。
    金日成在谈到卫国战争时指出：美国干涉者不仅在前线遭到军事失败而且还遭到政治失败以后，就在朝鲜干下滔天罪行。他们使用化学武器和细菌武器，轰炸和平城市、乡村和电力厂，野蛮地轰炸居民区，企图毁灭朝鲜平民。
    金日成说：但是，任何暴行都不能使爱好自由的朝鲜人民屈膝。朝鲜人民军以及和他们并肩作战的中国人民志愿军的战斗力量越来越壮大了，他们是一支不可战胜的军队。在朝鲜南部英勇作战的游击队的队伍也越来越壮大了。共和国后方的力量日益增强；工人、农民和知识分子，事实上是全体人民，在“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利”的口号下忘我地劳动着。
    金日成继续说：朝鲜人民是要和平的。我们在板门店的代表团采取了一切措施以期获致一个停战协议。但是，美方一面空谈和平，另一面则实际破坏谈判和扩大战争。
    金日成在结语中表示朝鲜全体人民坚决要在对美国侵略者进行的这个正义的卫国战争中取得胜利，保卫他们的民主果实，保卫他们的自由和独立。
    金日成的演说屡次被热烈的鼓掌声打断，这是与会的人们向朝鲜的解放者——苏军、苏联人民和朝鲜人民之间的不可动摇的友谊致敬，向金日成、毛泽东致敬，向全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师约·维·斯大林致敬。
    接着，苏联驻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国大使拉佐瓦耶夫致词，他代表苏联人民向朝鲜人民致热烈衷心的敬意。
    中国人民志愿军代表把中国人民志愿军的锦旗一面献给兄弟的朝鲜人民军。中华人民共和国驻朝鲜大使馆代办和各人民民主国家外交使团首长也发表了贺词。
    大会极为热烈地通过了向约·维·斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席和金日成将军的致敬电。
