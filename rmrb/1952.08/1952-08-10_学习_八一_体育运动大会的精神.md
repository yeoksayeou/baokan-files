    Learning the Spirit of the "August 1st" Sports Meeting
      Du Ping, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    Head of the Visiting Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    Just as we commemorate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the great and glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Army Day, we, representing the Volunteers, were invited back to the motherland to visit and participate in the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Sports Meeting. We feel very honored. We extend our warm congratulations to all comrades of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and to the athletes, performers, representatives, and staff attending this grand event! We pay our highest respects to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the creators and leaders of our people's army!
    Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the support of the people of the whole country, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has made immortal contributions to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people for the past twenty-five years; after eliminating more than eight million Kuomintang reactionary troops directly supported by American imperialism and liberating the mainland of the country, it has been actively consolidating national defense, building a modern and regularized national defense force, and participating in national production and construction, achieving remarkable achievements in a short period of three years. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has become the cornerstone of defending the motherland and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. The greater strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a great encouragement to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army who are fighting the American aggressors in Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers have inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of the Liberation Army, learning from the glorious example of the Liberation Army, and for twenty-one months, together with the Korean People's Army, have inflicted heavy blows on the American aggressors and their accomplice armies, causing the enemy to suffer huge losses in manpower and material resources, and causing the "steel warfare," chemical warfare, and germ warfare that the enemy relied on to suffer shameful defeats. Now, we have consolidated the victories already won by the Chinese and Korean people, gained rich experience in defeating the American aggressor army, and effectively defended our country's security and defended peace. Our Chinese People's Volunteers themselves, as Commander Peng Dehuai said, "have been tempered into an invincible force." However, we deeply understand that the American aggressors and their accomplices have no intention of repenting. In order to smash the enemy's aggressive conspiracies and strive for an early, fair, and reasonable solution to the Korean issue, we must continue to learn from the fine traditions and new army-building experiences of the Liberation Army, and work harder to improve our ability to defeat the enemy. This visit back to the country to participate in the Liberation Army "August 1st" Sports Meeting is a good opportunity for us to learn. In addition to participating in the sports meeting's performances with sports and artistic programs as a gift for the great "August 1st" Army Day 25th Anniversary Sports Meeting, our main task is to learn.
    In the various competitions, performances, and exhibitions of this conference, we saw the significant achievements of the People's Liberation Army in cultural learning, sports, military technology, and literary and artistic activities. The soldiers of the Liberation Army have begun to master and become proficient in the sports required by modern military science and technology from the sky to the sea, and many athletes have created the highest national records since liberation. Various units performed many excellent literary and artistic programs. These works truly implemented the policy of serving the soldiers and have the characteristics of combativeness and mass participation. Many units have eliminated illiteracy and launched a large-scale advance toward cultural and scientific knowledge. Some soldiers who did not recognize many characters a few months ago are now participating in complex cultural tests. The sports meeting powerfully demonstrates that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is not only an invincible army with strong combat effectiveness, but also has a high level of cultural accomplishment and a healthy physique. The conference also showed the great efforts made by the people of the motherland and the People's Liberation Army to create their own happy life and to defend world peace, and showed the high patriotism and unparalleled creativity of the people of the motherland and the people's soldiers.
    From this conference, we also realized many significant advantages and characteristics of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in culture and sports. First, the content of the conference is closely integrated with the actual situation of the troops. The sports program of the conference—especially military sports, aviation sports, and water sports—can not only exercise the body, but also cultivate the troops' brave, determined, agile, and flexible qualities, which directly contributes to the modernization of the troops and the improvement of combat effectiveness. Various literary and artistic performances, cultural learning tests, and exhibitions also vividly reflect and guide the cultural construction of the troops, encouraging and promoting the troops to move forward. Second, cultural and sports activities have broad mass participation. The thousands of athletes who participated in the conference were all selected by various units. They are not a small number of "prominent figures" cultivated specifically to win championships, but rather active elements who are connected with the masses and represent the broad masses. They include many soldiers, as well as commanders at all levels and senior cadres who have experienced many battles. The programs and skills they perform are loved by the broad masses of officers and soldiers, and are examples for the entire army to learn from and promote, and are most likely to inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of officers and soldiers. This conference will promote the popularization and improvement of cultural and sports activities in the troops, and will directly contribute to the construction of the troops. Third, the conference demonstrated the spirit of combining collectivism and revolutionary heroism of the People's Liberation Army. Every unit and member participating in the conference is brave, serious, intense, and striving to make progress in the competition, but there is a spirit of unity, friendship, mutual learning, and mutual respect among each other. They can all consciously abide by discipline, abide by the referee, and have good sportsmanship. They not only cherish their own achievements, but also rejoice in the excellent achievements created by other units and comrades, truly demonstrating the noble qualities of the people's soldiers and carrying forward the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army. Fourth, we must also learn from the organizational leadership methods of the People's Liberation Army in carrying out cultural learning movements and cultural and sports activities to accelerate modernization; and learn from the spirit of officers and soldiers fighting tenaciously, studying diligently and practicing hard, uniting and helping each other, and overcoming difficulties. This spirit and strength were fully demonstrated in this large-scale sports meeting. This is the guarantee for the vigorous development of cultural and sports activities of the People's Liberation Army and the achievement of great achievements.
    This conference has given our Volunteer delegation so many and rich learning contents, which makes us very moved and excited. The literary and artistic programs and sports projects performed by our Volunteer delegation are far inferior to those of the Liberation Army units, but we have received encouragement and praise from the people of the motherland and the Liberation Army. This is the love, hope, and supervision of the people of the motherland and the comrades of the Liberation Army. In addition to expressing our gratitude to the people of the motherland and the leaders and all comrades of the Liberation Army at all levels, we will definitely bring the spirit and achievements of the conference to the Korean front line, and spread it deeply to the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Volunteers, and launch a widespread learning movement, so that the spirit and achievements of the conference will become the power to strike at the American aggressors, defend the motherland, and defend world peace.
    At present, the American aggressors are still delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, attempting to maintain international tension; and are continuing to expand their armaments, arm Japan and West Germany, and actively prepare to expand the war of aggression. Therefore, this conference has extremely important significance for our struggle. Our Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely respond to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's call to the People's Liberation Army in the opening speech of the conference: "...On the basis of existing rich experience, we will unswervingly further develop towards complete regularization and modernization, and shoulder the glorious task of defending the motherland and defending peace." We will always learn from the glorious example of the People's Liberation Army, and fight to the end for a fair and reasonable solution to the Korean issue, and for defending the motherland, defending the Far East, and defending world peace!

    学习“八一”体育运动大会的精神
      中国人民志愿军政治部副主任
    中国人民志愿军归国参观团团长  杜平
    正当伟大光荣的中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年纪念的时候，我们代表志愿军应邀回到了祖国，参观并参加了中国人民解放军“八一”体育运动大会。我们感觉非常荣幸。谨向中国人民解放军陆、空、海各部队全体同志、向出席这次盛会的运动员、演员、代表和工作人员们致热烈的祝贺！向我国人民军队的创造者与领导者中国共产党和毛主席、朱总司令致最崇高的敬礼！
    中国人民解放军在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在全国人民的支持下，二十五年来，为中国人民解放事业创立了不朽的功勋；在消灭了为美帝国主义所直接支持的八百多万国民党反动军队、解放了全国大陆之后，又积极地进行着巩固国防、建设现代化正规化国防军和参加国家生产建设的工作，并在短短的三年中，获得了卓著的成就。中国人民解放军已成为捍卫祖国、保卫远东与世界和平的柱石。中国人民解放军的更加壮大，对于正在朝鲜打击美国侵略军的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，乃是一个极大的鼓舞。中国人民志愿军继承与发扬了解放军的优良传统，学习着解放军的光辉榜样，二十一个月来，和朝鲜人民军一起给美国侵略者及其帮凶军以惨重的打击，使敌人在人力物力上受到了巨大的损失，使敌人所依恃的“钢铁战”、化学战、细菌战都遭到了可耻的失败。现在，我们业已巩固了中、朝人民已得的胜利，获得了战胜了美国侵略军的丰富的经验，有效地保卫了我国的安全，保卫了和平。我们中国人民志愿军本身，亦正如彭德怀司令员所说：“业已锻炼成为一支不可战胜的力量”。但是，我们深深地懂得：美国侵略者及其帮凶并无悔祸之意。为了粉碎敌人的侵略阴谋，争取早日公平合理地解决朝鲜问题，我们必须继续学习解放军的优良传统和新的建军经验，更加努力提高自己战胜敌人的本领。这次归国参观解放军“八一”体育运动大会，就是我们学习的一个好机会。我们代表团除了以体育和文艺节目参加运动会的表演，作为对于伟大的“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会的献礼外，主要的任务，就是学习。
    在这次大会的各项竞赛、表演和展览中，我们看到了人民解放军在文化学习、体育运动、军事技术和文艺活动等各方面的重大成就。解放军的战士已开始掌握并熟练了从天空到海洋为现代军事科学技术所需要的体育运动，许多运动员创造了解放后的全国的最高纪录。各个部队表演了许多优秀的文艺节目，这些作品真正贯彻了为兵服务的方针，具有战斗性和群众性的特色。许多部队已经消除文盲，展开了向文化科学知识的大进军。有的战士在几个月前还识字不多，现在已经参加复杂的文化测验了。运动大会有力地说明了中国人民解放军不仅是一支具有强大战斗力的不可战胜的军队，而且具有高度文化素养和健壮的体魄。大会也显示了祖国人民和人民解放军为创造自己的幸福生活，为保卫世界和平所作的巨大努力，显示了祖国人民和人民战士高度爱国主义的积极性和无比的创造性。
    从这次大会中，我们还体会到中国人民解放军在文化、体育运动中的许多显著的优点和特点。首先是大会的内容与部队的实际情况密切结合。大会的体育节目——特别是军事体育、航空体育、水上体育，不仅可以锻炼身体，而且能培养部队勇敢、坚毅、机敏、灵活的品质，直接有助于部队现代化的建设和战斗力的提高。各种文艺节目表演，文化学习的测验和展览，也都生动地反映着和指导着部队的文化建设，鼓舞并推动部队前进。第二是文化、体育运动具有广大的群众性。参加大会的数千名运动员都是经过各部队推选出来的，他们不是专为夺锦标而培养的少数“风头人物”，而是联系群众的、代表广大群众的积极分子。其中包括许多战士，也有着各级指挥员和身经百战的高级干部。他们所表演的节目和技巧，为广大指战员所热爱，是全军学习和推广的榜样，最能启发广大指战员的积极性和创造性。这次大会将促进部队文化体育运动的普及与提高，直接有助于部队的建设。第三，大会表现了人民解放军集体主义和革命英雄主义相结合的精神。参加大会的每一个单位和成员，在竞赛中是勇敢的、认真的、激烈的、竞相进取的，但相互之间充满了团结友爱、互相学习、互相尊重的精神。他们都能自觉地服从纪律、遵守裁判，有着良好的体育道德。他们不仅珍视自己的成绩，而且都为其他单位和同志所创造的优良成绩而欢欣鼓舞，真正表现了人民战士的高贵品质，发扬了人民解放军的光荣传统。第四，我们还要学习人民解放军为加紧现代化建设而开展文化学习运动、开展文化体育活动的组织领导方法；学习指战员们顽强战斗、勤学勤练、团结互助、克服困难的精神。这种精神和力量在这次规模盛大的运动会中完全表现出来了。这是人民解放军文化体育运动蓬勃开展并获得伟大成就的保证。
    这次大会给了我们志愿军代表团以如此众多而丰富的学习内容，使我们十分感动和兴奋。我们志愿军代表团所表演的文艺节目和体育项目，较之解放军各部队相差甚远，但我们却受到了祖国人民和解放军的鼓励和赞扬，这是祖国人民和解放军同志们对我们的爱护、希望和督促。除了对祖国人民和解放军各级首长及全体同志表示感谢之外，我们一定把大会的精神和成就带到朝鲜前线，使之深入普及到志愿军广大指战员中去，展开一个广泛的学习运动，使大会的精神和成就，变成打击美国侵略者、保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的力量。
    目前，美国侵略者还在拖延朝鲜停战谈判，企图保持国际间的紧张局势；并在继续扩充军备、武装日本和西德，积极准备扩大侵略战争。因此，这次大会对于我们的斗争有着极其重大的意义。我们中国人民志愿军坚决响应朱德总司令在大会开幕词中对人民解放军的号召：“……在已有的丰富经验的基础之上，坚定不移地进一步向完全正规化、现代化发展，肩负起保卫祖国、保卫和平的光荣任务。”我们将永远学习着人民解放军的光辉榜样，为争取朝鲜问题的公平合理解决，为保卫祖国，保卫远东与世界和平而战斗到底！
