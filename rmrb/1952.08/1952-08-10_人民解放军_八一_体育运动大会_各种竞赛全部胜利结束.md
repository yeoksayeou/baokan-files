The athletes strictly observed discipline, enthusiastically helped each other, and exchanged experiences, which continuously improved all results and laid a solid foundation for a wider development of sports in the army.

Many outstanding soldiers and company cadre athletes emerged during the Games. The baseball teams of the North China Military Region and the Public Security Forces were entirely composed of soldiers and company cadres. They won the baseball championship and third place of the Games respectively. A company commander and a squad leader from the Northeast Military Region participated in the men's 800-meter relay race and, together with two other athletes, created the national record since liberation. Many of the winners in motorcycle and bicycle events were correspondents from agencies and units. Most of the participants in gymnastics and weightlifting were company cadres and soldiers. The first place winner in the men's long jump was a political instructor from a certain company on the front lines of national defense. The cavalryman Gang Shimu Le (an Inner Mongolian) from the North China Military Region won two championships in horse racing. They are all representative figures produced by the gradual and widespread development of sports in the army.

Seven sports competition results broke the national records since liberation. Six of these were in track and field. These six were men's high jump, women's long jump, men's 800-meter relay race, men's 1600-meter relay race, women's 400-meter relay race, and women's 800-meter relay race.

This Games proved that the athletes in the People's Liberation Army have excellent style, strong physique, superb skills, and are familiar with and strictly abide by various sports regulations.

Now that the various competitions have ended, aviation sports performances and water sports performances will continue to be held on the 10th. The Games will officially close on the 11th.
