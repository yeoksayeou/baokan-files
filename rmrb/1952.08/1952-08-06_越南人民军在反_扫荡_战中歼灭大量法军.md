Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese People's Army has annihilated large numbers of invading French troops in counter-"sweeping" operations in North Vietnam. According to an announcement by the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, based on incomplete statistics, from the beginning of June to July 20, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated 2,376 French troops in North Vietnam. If calculated from the end of the liberation of Hoa Binh on February 23rd, until July 20th, the People's Army has annihilated a total of 13,376 French troops in North Vietnam.

From the beginning of June to July 20, the invading French army launched 14 "sweeping" operations. The French army used forces ranging from one or two battalions for one or two days in the smaller "sweeping" operations, to seven or eight battalions for seven or eight days in the medium-sized ones. Only the battles in Quang Yen and Hai Duong provinces lasted for 20 days and are still continuing.

The Vietnamese People's Army actively resisted and crushed these "sweeping" operations, inflicting heavy losses on the French army. In particular, on June 2, the People's Army annihilated 450 French troops in An Chuc, Ninh Binh Province; on June 28, they annihilated 220 French troops in Kinh Mon, Quang Yen Province; and on July 3, they annihilated two companies of French troops in the southern part of Vu Ban County, Nam Dinh Province.

During this period, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces carried out guerrilla warfare daily through sabotaging communication lines, mine warfare, ambushes, raids, and harassment tactics, killing a number of French troops in each battle; they also destroyed several French strongholds.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces in Central and South Vietnam, in coordination with the victorious struggle of the People's Army in North Vietnam, are constantly strengthening guerrilla warfare. They have annihilated a large number of the invading French army's vital forces and strengthened themselves in battle. In the Vinh Long-Tra Vinh area of ​​South Vietnam, the People's Armed Forces, since launching a short-term patriotic kill-the-enemy competition as a birthday gift to President Ho Chi Minh on March 3, had killed more than 300 French troops and captured 10 machine guns, 90 rifles, 1 steamship, 30 sailboats, and a large amount of military supplies by May. In Central Vietnam, in Binh Thuan province alone, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces killed or wounded 1,309 invading French troops, captured 60, shot down one French aircraft, destroyed 21 French armored vehicles and military vehicles, 2 artillery pieces, and other large quantities of weapons, and captured 10 machine guns, as well as 300 submachine guns and rifles from December 1 last year to May 31 this year.

The activities of the guerrillas in Central and South Vietnam within the French-occupied areas are very extensive, and they frequently annihilate French troops near the French military centers; this not only encourages the fighting spirit of the people in the French-occupied areas but also further demoralizes the French army. In Central Vietnam, the People's Armed Forces launched an attack in the suburbs of Hue on May 13, capturing 100 French troops; in South Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces infiltrated the San Son Nhut French airfield, 10 kilometers southeast of Saigon, on April 11, destroying two French watchtowers and two barracks, annihilating nearly one company of French troops.

The People's Armed Forces in Central and South Vietnam also often concentrated superior forces to conduct mobile warfare, annihilating French troops by the company and battalion. In Central Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces completely annihilated two French battalions heading to Quang Tri province for reinforcement on March 28.

The People's Armed Forces in Central and South Vietnam have also won many victories in counter-"sweeping" operations. In Central Vietnam, the People's Armed Forces annihilated the entire 2nd Moroccan Battalion and part of the 27th Algerian Battalion of the French army "sweeping" the area 15 kilometers southeast of Hue on June 24; in the Water Reed Plain north of Saigon in South Vietnam, the People's Armed Forces had foiled multiple "sweeping" operations by the French army against the guerrilla base there in the first half of this year. On June 7, the People's Armed Forces repelled a battalion of French troops attacking the area. In that day's battle alone, the People's Armed Forces annihilated 150 French troops.

    越南人民军在反“扫荡”战中歼灭大量法军
    【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社消息：越南人民军在北越反“扫荡”战中，歼灭了大量侵越法军。据越南人民军总司令部公布，根据不完全的统计，自六月初到七月二十日，越南人民军在北越歼灭法军二千三百七十六人。如果从二月二十三日解放和平城战役结束时算起，则到七月二十日为止，人民军在北越共歼灭了法军一万三千三百七十六人。
    从六月初到七月二十日，侵越法军发动过十四次
    “扫荡”战。法军在这些“扫荡”战中使用的兵力，规模较小的有一两个营，为期一两天；中等的有七八个营，为期七八天。只有在广安省和海阳省的战斗持续到二十天，现在仍在继续进行中。
    越南人民军活跃地抵抗和粉碎了这些“扫荡”，使法军遭受严重的损失。特别是在六月二日，人民军在宁平省安祝歼灭了法军四百五十人；六月二十八日在广安省敬门歼灭了法军二百二十人；七月三日在南定省务本县南部歼灭了法军两个连。
    在这一期间，越南人民武装每日都以破坏交通线、地雷战、伏击战、突击战、困扰战等方式进行游击战，每次战斗都杀死了若干法军；他们并摧毁了法军据点数处。
    【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社消息，中越和南越的越南人民武装，配合着北越人民军的胜利斗争，正在不断地加强游击战争。它们歼灭了侵越法军的大量有生力量，并在战斗中壮大了自己。在南越永隆——茶荣地区的人民武装，自从在三月三日发起短期的爱国主义杀敌竞赛作为给胡志明主席的生日贺礼以后到五月为止，就曾打死了法军三百多名，缴获了机枪十挺、步枪九十支、汽船一艘、帆船三十艘和大量的军用物资。在中越，仅平顺一省，越南人民武装便在去年十二月一日到今年五月三十一日的六个月中，打死打伤了侵越法军一千三百零九人，俘掳六十人，击落法机一架，击毁法军装甲车和军车二十一辆、大炮两门及其他大宗武器，缴获机枪十挺以及冲锋枪和步枪等三百支。
    中越和南越的游击队在法军占领区的活动范围十分广泛，并不时在法军的军事重心附近歼灭法军；这不独鼓舞了法军占领区人民的斗志，并使法军的士气更加颓丧。在中越，人民武装曾于五月十三日在顺化的郊区出击，俘掳了法军一百人；在南越，越南人民武装于四月十一日渗入西贡东南十公里的三山日法军机场，击毁了法军瞭望堡和兵营各两座，歼灭法军近一个连。
    中越和南越的人民武装还常常集中优势兵力进行运动战，歼灭了成连成营的法军。在中越，越南人民武装于三月二十八日全歼了开往广治省增援的法军两个营。
    中越和南越的人民武装在反“扫荡”战中也赢得了许多胜利。中越的人民武装于六月二十四日歼灭了在顺化东南十五公里地区进行“扫荡”的法军第二摩洛哥营全部和第二十七阿尔及利亚营的一部；在南越西贡北面水草平原，人民武装在今年上半年曾粉碎了法军向那里的游击根据地的多次“扫荡”。六月七日，人民武装击退了向该区进攻的法军一营。单在那一天的战斗中，人民武装就歼灭了法军一百五十人。
