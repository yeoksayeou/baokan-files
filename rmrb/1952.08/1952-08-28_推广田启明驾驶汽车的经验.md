Promoting Tian Qiming's Experience in Driving Automobiles

At present, automobile transport enterprises generally experience high automobile damage rates and high accident rates. Although this is related to factors such as dilapidated vehicles, rudimentary repair equipment, and poor-quality materials and parts, the main reason is that drivers have not fully emphasized vehicle driving and maintenance. While driving, they have not mastered safe operating methods; vehicle inspection and maintenance are not done frequently or promptly enough, and they are not proficient in vehicle maintenance techniques.

Tian Qiming, a driver from the Baoding Branch of the Hebei Provincial Transportation Company, created a new record of 86,400 kilometers of safe driving by overcoming the above-mentioned common problems. Tian Qiming's experience lies first in his handling of the relationship between machines and people. He does not treat human labor as slaves serving machines, but uses every means to study and master the performance of machines, paying full attention to routine maintenance. Thus, he makes machines subservient to people and makes people masters of machines. Secondly, in terms of management systems, he advocated a method that combines driving work with maintenance work, that is, a specialized responsibility system in automobile driving work. He believes that "every driver should consider the interests of the people in every way." Driving an automobile should also include maintaining the automobile, so that the people's automobile can play a greater role in their hands. This changes the relationship of automobile drivers merely being employed laborers of the transportation company. It is precisely on this basis that Tian Qiming can fully exert his enthusiasm and creativity, and create a complete set of methods in operation and maintenance work.

Tian Qiming's advanced experience should be widely promoted. In the promotion, all localities should first focus on carrying out patriotic education for the drivers, so that they have a high spirit of responsibility for the people's transportation cause, and so that they realize ideologically that promoting Tian Qiming's advanced experience is not only an effective way to achieve safe driving, vehicle maintenance, and reduced driving costs, but also a concrete manifestation of patriotism. Only on this basis can Tian Qiming's driving and maintenance techniques be well implemented and carried out, and the management of transportation enterprises can be continuously improved.

    推广田启明驾驶汽车的经验
    目前，在汽车运输企业中，普遍地存在着汽车损坏率大和肇事率大的现象。这虽然与车辆破旧、修理设备简陋、材料配件不好等条件有关，但主要的原因，还是司机人员没有充分重视车辆驾驶和保养工作。在驾驶时，没有掌握安全的操作方法；对车辆检查和保养，做得不经常、不及时，对保养车辆的技术也不熟练。
    河北省运输公司保定分公司司机田启明，由于克服了以上的通病，创造了安全行车八万六千四百公里的新纪录。田启明的经验，首先就在于他在处理机器和人的关系上，不是把人的劳动当作为机器服务的奴隶，而是用一切办法，研究和掌握机器的性能，充分注意平时的保养工作，因而使机器驯服于人，使人成为机器的主人。其次，在管理制度上，他倡导了驾驶工作和保养工作相结合的方法，也就是在汽车驾驶工作中的专责制度。他认为“每个司机都应该处处为人民的利益打算”，驾驶汽车也应该保养汽车，使人民的汽车在自己手中发挥更大的效用。从而改变了汽车司机只是运输公司的雇佣劳动者的关系。也正是在这些基础上，田启明才能充分发挥积极性和创造性，在操作和保养工作方面，创造出一套完整的办法。
    田启明的先进经验，应该加以普遍推广。各地在推广中，首先应该抓紧对司机人员们进行爱国主义教育，使他们有高度的对人民运输事业负责的精神，使他们从思想上认识到推广田启明先进经验，不仅是做到安全行车、保养车辆和减低行车成本的有效办法，而且是爱国主义的具体表现。只有在这一基础上，才能很好执行和贯彻田启明的驾驶和保养的技术，并不断改进交通运输企业的管理。
