    Advanced Experience Promotion Should Not Be Treated as a Crash Task
    Zhao Chunshan, Director of Jinsheng Textile Factory

    Last October, the Jinsheng Textile Factory promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. At that time, 93% of the fine yarn workers studied this work method. The roller cotton waste rate dropped from 2.2% to 0.87%, and the quality of the yarn also improved significantly. This March, we promoted the 1951 Weaving Work Method. At that time, 94% of the weaving workers studied this work method. The substandard cloth rate dropped from 1.8% to 0.098%, and the average output per loom increased from 31.17 yards to 33.42 yards. However, after a few months, the situation changed. The roller cotton waste rate rose to 1.1%, and the substandard cloth rate rose to 0.17%. What is the reason for this phenomenon? The workers said that the raw cotton was not good, the climate was not good, the machines were not up to standard, and there were too many yarn breakages, so the advanced work method could not be implemented.

    This July, when the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign began, the plans we made did not meet the targets required by the higher-level leading authorities. Subsequently, the Shanxi Daily also criticized the chaotic phenomenon of our promoting these two advanced work methods. Only then did we begin to pay attention to this issue. Recently, we conducted an inspection and test. This inspection and test enabled us to further understand the situation of promoting advanced experience in our factory. The inspection and test revealed that only about 21.5% of the workers actually performed the work method well in actual operation; 60% basically did not perform the work method; and about 20% of the workers did not know these two work methods at all. Therefore, the problem does not lie in the poor quality of raw cotton, but in the fact that advanced work methods have not been universally promoted. For example, during the typical performance in the test, using the currently used raw cotton and adopting the advanced work method, the roller cotton waste rate was reduced to 0.4%. This fact greatly educated the workers, and many workers automatically implemented the work method again. In the days following the inspection, the average roller cotton waste rate was 0.7%, which was even lower than the 0.87% when the advanced work method was first promoted last October. This situation also fully illustrates that the reason why the promotion work fell into chaos was not due to objective difficulties, but due to problems on the leadership's side.

    The main problem on the leadership's side is that we have treated the work of promoting advanced experience with a purely task-oriented view in the past. We did not have a sufficient understanding of the important significance of promoting advanced experience, and we believed that the task was completed once the promotion was over and the workers had learned it. Under the influence of this erroneous view, we neglected ideological education work in the promotion process, and we did not take effective measures to consolidate the existing achievements after the promotion.

    To make workers abandon their long-standing operating methods and consciously implement new work methods, it is necessary to repeatedly conduct ideological education for workers so that each worker can truly understand the superiority of advanced work methods. Otherwise, workers will not only be unable to consciously use new work methods, but may even generate resistance. The results of this inspection and test well illustrate this point: about 20% of the workers who insist on mastering advanced work methods were mostly those who learned it during the first batch of promotion. Because, during the first batch of promotion, the leadership was relatively concentrated, the ideological mobilization work was done more fully, and these workers had a better work attitude, so they were able to regularly and consciously implement advanced work methods. However, we did not carry out ideological education work in subsequent promotion work, showing a tendency of being tight at first and then loose. Therefore, the ideological situation of the workers who learned later was quite complex, and their mastery of advanced work methods was also uneven. For example, the aforementioned 60% of the workers who did not implement the work method, most of them had generally learned the work method, but did not have a sufficient understanding of the superiority of the work method, and could not appreciate the benefits of the work method in operation, so they had no confidence in the work method, resulting in "advanced work method when someone is inspecting, free work method when no one is inspecting." Some people even said: "I can watch four hundred spindles without using the work method, why bother running around," thinking that using the work method is "not free." Some workers did not even learn it during the promotion, or even did not learn it at all. We did not analyze and study these situations at any time and correct them in a timely manner, but allowed them to develop, causing the promotion work to fall into a state of drifting and chaos.

    Promoting advanced experience is a revolution in production technology. We also did not have a sufficient understanding of this. Therefore, we did not form new work methods into regulations and systems in a timely manner after the old operating procedures were broken. In the promotion work, the technical inspection system and the responsibility system of technical personnel were not established, and the workshop formed a phenomenon of no one being responsible. When problems occurred during the promotion, no one cared about it. The old operating procedures were no longer used, and the new regulations and systems were not established, so workers could use the "free work method." This is also an important reason for the promotion work falling into a state of drifting and chaos.

    This inspection is a good education for us. From the facts revealed in the inspection, we deeply feel that promoting advanced experience is not only a basic method for completing the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, but also a revolution in production technology, and an ideological transformation movement for the masses of employees. Therefore, this work must be carried out with leadership, planning, and step-by-step. Like we did in the past, treating the promotion work as a temporary crash task and completing it rashly is bound to fail.

### 不能把推广先进经验当成突击任务

    不能把推广先进经验当成突击任务
    晋生纺织厂厂长　赵春山
    去年十月，晋生纺织厂推广了郝建秀工作法，当时有百分之九十三的细纱工人学习了这一工作法，皮辊花率由百分之二点二降低到百分之零点八七，纱的质量也显著提高。今年三月，我们又推广了一九五一织布工作法，当时有百分之九十四的织布工人学习了这一工作法，次布率由百分之一点八降低到零点零九八，每台布机的平均产量由三一·一七码提高到三三点四二码。但是，没过几个月，情况就有了变化。皮辊花率又上升到百分之一点一，次布率上升到百分之零点一七。究竟为什么会发生这种现象呢？工人说是原棉不好，气候不好，机器不合规格，断头太多，因而先进工作法也没法执行了。
    今年七月，增产节约运动开始，我们订的计划达不到上级领导机关要求的指标。接着，山西日报又对我们推广这两个先进工作法的混乱现象提出了批评。这时，我们才开始重视这个问题。最近，我们进行了一次检查和测验。这一次的检查和测验，使我们进一步了解了我厂推广先进经验的情况。从检查测验中，发现在实际操作中执行工作法较好的工人只有百分之二十一点五左右；基本上没有执行工作法的有百分之六十；还有百分之二十左右的工人根本不会这两个工作法。因此问题并不在于原棉不好，而是先进工作法没有普遍推广。例如在测验中做典型表演时，用目前使用的原棉，采用先进工作法，皮辊花率又降低到百分之零点四。这一事实很好地教育了工人，许多工人又自动地执行工作法。在检查以后的几天内，皮辊花率平均为百分之零点七，比去年十月最初推广先进工作法时的百分之零点八七还低。这一情况也充分说明推广工作所以陷于混乱状态，并不是因客观困难，而是领导方面的问题。
    领导方面的主要问题，就是我们过去以单纯任务观点来对待推广先进经验的工作，对于推广先进经验的重要意义认识不足，认为推广完了工人学会了就算完成了这个任务。在这一错误观点支使之下，我们在推广过程中忽视了思想教育工作，在推广后也没有采取有效的措施去巩固已有的成绩。
    要使工人抛掉自己多年习惯的操作方法，自觉地执行新的工作法，必须反复地对工人进行思想教育，使每个工人都能真正领会先进工作法的优越性，否则，工人不但不能自觉地运用新工作法，甚至会产生抵抗情绪。这次检查测验的结果就很好地说明了这一点：百分之二十左右的坚持掌握先进工作法的工人，大部分是在第一批推广时学会的。因为，第一批推广时，领导力量比较集中，思想发动工作作得比较充分，加以这一批工人的劳动态度较好，所以他们能够经常地自觉地执行先进工作法。但是，我们在以后的推广工作中，却没有把思想教育工作贯彻下去，表现出先紧后松。所以，以后学习的工人的思想情况相当复杂，对先进工作法的掌握也参差不齐。比如前面所谈的百分之六十的没有执行工作法的工人，其中大多数是大体上学会了工作法，但对工作法的优越性认识不足，在操作中体会不到工作法的好处，因而对工作法没有信心，结果成了“有人检查是先进工作法，没人检查是自由工作法”。有些人甚至说：“不用工作法我也能看四百锭子，何必多跑腿”，认为运用工作法“不自由”。也有一部分工人在推广时就没有学会，甚至根本没有学习过。我们对这些情况没有随时加以分析研究和及时地纠正，而是听任其发展下去，致使推广工作陷于自流、混乱状态。
    推广先进经验是生产技术上的革命。对这一点，我们也认识不足。因之，我们没有在旧的操作规程打破以后，及时地把新的工作法形成规程制度。在推广工作中，技术检查制和技术人员的责任制都没有建立起来，车间中形成无人负责现象。推广中发生了问题没人过问，旧的操作规程不用了，新的规程制度没有建立起来，工人们就可以用“自由工作法”了。这也是使推广工作陷于自流、混乱的一个重要原因。
    这一次的检查，对我们是一个很好的教育。从检查出的事实中，我们深深感到推广先进经验不仅是完成增产节约的基本方法，而且是生产技术上的革命，是职工群众的一个思想改造运动。因此，就必须有领导、有计划、有步骤地进行这一工作。像我们过去一样，把推广工作当成一时的突击任务，草率地去完成，必然失败。
