Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 7th: According to London's "Worker's Daily," Dean Johnson of Canterbury preached at Canterbury Cathedral on the evening of the 3rd, with the title: "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." This was the most well-attended evening prayer service at the cathedral in many years.

Johnson said: Those who pursue truth are always unremitting. He praised the achievements of New China and said: Bishop Zheng He-fu of the Anglican Church of China told him: "Under the People's Government of China, it is easier to be a Christian than before. Because it is now easier to proclaim the truth than before." Johnson said: Isn't it very important for Christians to know the truth, to know the current world situation? If they know the truth, they can guarantee world peace. He said: "Thank God that we are not at war with China. May God bless us that we will never be at war with China. I know that the Chinese are the most peace-loving people, and may God bless the British people with the patience to discover the truth about China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population."

After the evening prayer, Dean Johnson stood outside the southwest corner gate of the cathedral, talking and shaking hands with many people. About a hundred people quickly gathered around him.

    约翰逊教长在坎特伯雷教堂讲道
    赞扬中国人民热爱世界和平
    【新华社布拉格七日电】据伦敦“工人日报”报道，坎特伯雷教长约翰逊三日晚间在坎特伯雷教堂讲道，题目是：“你们一定要晓得真理，真理就会叫你们得到自由”。这是这个教堂多年以来人数最多的一次晚祷。
    约翰逊说：追求真理的人是永远不懈的。他赞扬新中国的成就，并且说：中华圣公会主教郑和甫告诉过他：“在中国的人民政府之下做一个基督教徒，要比以前更容易了。因为现在比以前更容易宣扬真理。”约翰逊说：晓得真理，晓得目前世界的形势，这对基督徒来说，难道不是非常重要的吗？假若他们晓得了真理，他们就可以保证世界的和平。他说：“感谢上帝，我们并没有和中国作战。愿上帝保佑我们永远不会和中国作战。我知道中国人是最爱和平的人民，愿上帝保佑英国人民能有耐心，去发现占全世界人口四分之一的中国的真相。”
    约翰逊教长在晚祷结束后站在教堂西南角门外，和许多人谈话与握手。在他周围很快地聚集了百来个人。
