    The Fifth District People's Government of Beijing Should Not Refuse Unemployment Registration for Impoverished Working Women

    Editor: I am a young working woman with a rudimentary knowledge of writing, capable of writing only a simple letter. On a certain day in July, I went to the Fifth District People's Government of Beijing to register, requesting that they find me a job (any kind of labor would do). The first thing the female comrade in charge of unemployment registration (about twenty years old) asked me was: "What school did you graduate from?" This stumped me. I said, "I haven't attended any school." The female comrade immediately refused to register me, saying, "You must be a graduate of at least a higher primary school. No matter what you do, you must at least be a graduate of a higher primary school." Her words poured a bucket of cold water on me, and I immediately walked away angrily. I think that in the old society, at least a well-off middle peasant family could afford to send their children to higher primary school. My family was poor peasants, so I couldn't even afford to attend elementary school. Now, the People's Government serves the people, and should not refuse my registration. Moreover, manual labor does not necessarily require a higher primary school education! Isn't this deliberately making things difficult for people? I hope the Fifth District People's Government can investigate this matter.
    Cheng Guilan

    Editor's Note: According to reader Cheng Guilan's reflection, individual staff members of the Fifth District People's Government of Beijing actually refused to register an impoverished working woman for unemployment, which is incorrect. In this regard, the leadership of the Fifth District People's Government should quickly investigate and correct the erroneous attitude of some staff members towards working people.

### 北京市第五区人民政府不应拒绝贫苦劳动妇女失业登记

    北京市第五区人民政府不应拒绝贫苦劳动妇女失业登记
    编辑同志：我是一个粗通文字、只能写封简单信的青年劳动妇女。七月某日，我到北京市第五区人民政府去登记，请求给我介绍职业（什么样的劳动活都可以）。一个负责失业登记工作的女同志（有二十多岁）头一句话就问我：“你是什么学校毕业？”这一下就把我问住了。我说：“什么学校也没有上过。”这个女同志马上就拒绝登记，说：“非高小毕业不行。不管做什么都至少要高小毕业。”她的话给我浇了一盆冷水，我马上就气愤走出来了。我想，在旧社会里，至少要富裕的中农才能供给子女上高小。我家是贫农，所以我连初小也上不起。现在，人民政府是为人民群众服务的，不应该拒绝我登记。而且，出力的事情，也并不一定都要高小毕业的文化程度呀！这不是故意和人为难吗？希望第五区人民政府能检查这件事。程桂兰
    编者按：据读者程桂兰反映，北京市第五区人民政府个别工作人员竟然拒绝贫苦的劳动妇女进行失业登记，这是不对的。对此，第五区人民政府的领导方面应迅速检查，纠正某些工作人员对待劳动人民的错误态度。
