Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th: To implement the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Labor Employment Issues," the East China Military and Administrative Committee convened the East China Labor Employment Conference from August 6th to 12th. The conference summarized the achievements of the East China governments at all levels in solving labor employment issues over the past three years: In addition to absorbing all of the more than 300,000 former public employees left over from the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary rule in the entire region, the people's governments have helped employ, accommodate, and provide relief to more than 1.2 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people in various places. This included approximately 240,000 unemployed workers, approximately 230,000 unemployed intellectuals, and approximately 750,000 elderly, weak, disabled, vagrant children, and vagrant beggars. In accordance with the specific conditions in East China, the conference formulated a work plan for labor employment issues in the East China region, preparing to systematically solve the overall labor employment problems in East China.

    Zeng Shan, Vice Chairman of the East China Military and Administrative Committee, and Shu Tong, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the East China Military and Administrative Committee, attended the meeting and gave instructions. Zeng Shan said: Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou attach special importance to the issue of labor employment. With the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, no problem, no difficulty, cannot be solved. Relevant departments in various places should have the confidence and determination to carry out this work. The competent authorities and employing units should break down concerns, boldly help the unemployed transform themselves, and boldly absorb, educate, and use them. At the same time, we should also estimate the difficulties in the work and plan and step-by-step achieve the overall solution of the labor employment problem in East China within three to five years. Shu Tong pointed out: To do a good job in labor employment, we must first carry out ideological mobilization, open up ideas, so that everyone understands the nature of this problem and the conditions in all aspects, and actively seek solutions from the development of production, and not rely solely on relief. All departments should regard this issue as a whole social problem, take the initiative to be responsible, and cooperate to help solve it, oppose any procrastination and waiting, and thoughts and practices of mutual evasion, and should also have longer-term plans, oppose any impetuous emotions.

    Wu Kejian, Director of the East China Labor Employment Committee, made a summary at the end of the meeting. He put forward clear opinions on how to carry out labor employment propaganda and education, registration and investigation, training, allocation, relief, resettlement, as well as organization, compilation, and implementation steps.

    Wu Kejian also explained the importance of registration work, registration work is the foundation of handling work, to form registration work into mass work, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, to fully understand the situation of the unemployed, especially to understand their strengths, in order to give full play to their strength in training, allocation and use. Wu Kejian asked the labor employment committees in various parts of East China to promptly formulate work plans for the second half of this year and comprehensive plans for the next two or three years, so as to solve the problem in a unified manner.

    The meeting also drafted the "Interim Measures for Registration of Unemployed Persons in East China" (draft), which will be implemented after being reported to the Central Government and the East China Military and Administrative Committee for approval. In the future, with the efforts of governments at all levels and the support of people from all walks of life, the labor employment problems in various parts of East China will be comprehensively solved in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    华东军政委员会召开劳动就业会议
    【新华社上海十七日电】为贯彻执行中央人民政府政务院“关于劳动就业问题的决定”，华东军政委员会在八月六日至十二日召开了华东劳动就业会议。会议总结了三年来华东各级人民政府在解决劳动就业问题上的成绩：全区除把国民党反动统治崩溃时遗留下来的三十余万旧公教人员全部包下来外，各地失业、半失业人员经人民政府帮助就业和收容、救济的，共达一百二十余万人，其中包括失业工人约二十四万人，失业知识分子约二十三万人，老弱残废、流浪儿童、游民乞丐等约七十五万人。会议按照华东具体情况，拟订了关于华东区劳动就业问题的工作计划，准备有步骤地解决华东的全面劳动就业问题。
    华东军政委员会曾山副主席，华东军政委员会文化教育委员会舒同主任曾到会作了指示。曾山说：毛主席和周总理特别重视劳动就业问题，我们有毛主席和中央人民政府的领导，任何问题，任何困难，没有不能解决的。各地有关部门应该有信心、有决心地进行这一工作，主管机关和用人机关应该打破顾虑，大胆帮助失业人员改造，大胆吸收和教育、使用他们。同时也应估计到工作中的困难，有计划、有步骤地做到在三、五年内全面解决华东的劳动就业问题。舒同指出：要做好劳动就业工作，首先要进行思想动员，打通思想，使大家认识这一问题的性质和各方面的条件，积极地从发展生产来求得解决，不能单纯依靠救济。各部门应把这一问题看作是整个社会问题，主动负责、协同合作地帮助解决，反对任何拖延等待、互相推诿的思想和做法，同时也应有较长期打算，反对任何急躁情绪。
    会议最后由华东劳动就业委员会主任吴克坚作总结，他对于如何进行劳动就业的宣传教育、登记调查、训练、调配、救济、安置以及组织、编制、进行步骤等问题，提出了明确意见。
    吴克坚并说明登记工作的重要性，登记工作是处理工作的基础，要把登记工作形成为群众性工作，发动群众，依靠群众，来全面了解失业人员的情况，特别要了解他们的长处，以便在训练、调配和使用中，充分发挥他们的力量。吴克坚要求华东各地劳动就业委员会及时地订出今年下半年的工作计划和今后二、三年内的全面计划，以便统筹解决。
    会议并拟订了“华东失业人员登记暂行办法”
    （草案），俟报经中央和华东军政委员会批准后施行。今后华东各地的劳动就业问题，在各级人民政府的努力和各阶层人民的支持下，将有计划有步骤地获得全面解决。
