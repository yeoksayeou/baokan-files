Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 6th. The Calcutta India-China Friendship Association held a public gathering on August 1st at the local Islamia College Hall to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Dr. Balu, the Indian judge who served in the Tokyo trial of war criminals, presided over the meeting.

Speakers at the meeting included: Professor Chakravarti, Secretary of the Calcutta India-China Friendship Association; Professor Bhattacharya, Member of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly; Basu, a member of the Indian medical team who served with the Eighth Route Army during the Anti-Japanese War; as well as Professor Lehman, Kaptain Chakravarti, and Mitra.

Dr. Balu said: The friendship between India and China has a long history. This friendship is now further consolidated. At a time when the American imperialists are forcing others to accept the "American way of life" and manufacturing weapons to prepare for a new war, this friendship is an important factor in ensuring peace and opposing American war preparations.

The exhibition of photographs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, organized by the Calcutta India-China Friendship Association, was held at Islamia College Hall from July 26th and ended on August 1st. More than 15,000 people visited. Visitors praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army's contribution to defending peace in Asia and the world in the comment book.

    加尔各答印中友好协会集会庆祝“八一”建军节
    【新华社新德里六日电】加尔各答印中友好协会于八月一日在当地回教学院大厅召开公共集会，庆祝中国人民解放军建军二十五周年。曾在东京审讯战争罪犯的印度法官巴鲁博士担任大会主席。
    在大会上演说的有：加尔各答印中友好协会书记查克拉瓦蒂教授、西孟加拉省立法会议委员巴塔查利雅教授、抗日战争时期曾随八路军服务的印度医疗队队员巴苏、以及雷曼教授、甲丁·查克拉瓦谛和米特拉等人。
    巴鲁博士说：印度和中国的友谊具有悠久的历史。这种友谊目前更有了进一步的巩固。在这美帝国主义者正强使别人接受“美国生活方式”并制造武器准备新战争的时候，这种友谊是保障和平、反对美国备战的重要因素。
    加尔各答印中友好协会举办的中国人民解放军图片展览会，自七月二十六日起在回教学院大厅举行，八月一日结束。前往参观的有一万五千多人。观众们在意见簿上赞扬中国人民解放军对于保卫亚洲与世界和平的贡献。
