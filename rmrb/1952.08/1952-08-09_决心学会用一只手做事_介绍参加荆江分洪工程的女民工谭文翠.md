    "Determined to Learn to Work with One Hand"
    ——Introducing Tan Wencui, a Female Migrant Worker Participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project
    I recently visited Tan Wencui, a female migrant worker known as the "Zhao Guilan of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project." She dedicated her left arm to the great construction cause of the motherland.
    Tan Wencui is eighteen years old this year and was born into a poor peasant family in Xintan, Zigui County, Hubei Province. At the end of February this year, she went to Yichang City to prepare to marry Huang Shunxiang (a construction worker). She had already received a marriage certificate. In early March, the trade union called on workers and their families to participate in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. Huang Shunxiang responded to the call of the trade union. Tan Wencui also registered with the workers' family committee. They said, "To build the motherland, marriage can be delayed a bit." The two of them participated in the work of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project together.
    Tan Wencui threw herself into the great construction cause of the motherland with amazing enthusiasm. She rushed to do heavy work such as picking up stones, digging earth, moving sleepers, and carrying steel rails. After finishing her own work, she went to help other female migrant workers. At night, she also took on the task of patrolling the construction site. Day and night, she worked intensely, just as she herself said: "I have to swallow my food quickly so I can do more work." Fatigue often attacked her, causing her head to spin and her eyes to ache. At this time, she thought of the hard days under the oppression of the landlord in the past, the good life after liberation, Chairman Mao's great call and the arduous spirit of the volunteers, and the beautiful scene after the completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. A huge force supported her. She splashed cold water on her head, wiped her eyes with a wet towel, and immediately went back to work with enthusiasm.
    In mid-April, the Jingjiang flood surged. In order to rush to transport national equipment and materials, everyone's work was very tense. At this time, Tan Wencui was working on the narrow-gauge railway at the Huangshantou construction site, and she had been elected as the leader of the eighth squadron of the transportation brigade. She pushed trucks day and night and did not sleep for four days and three nights in a row. On the night of the fourth day (the 18th), Tan Wencui pushed a truckload of steel bars from Ouchikou. On a downhill slope, the car was traveling very fast, and she fainted on the track due to excessive fatigue. The two trucks behind her rushed down the slope and ran over her left arm. When she woke up, she found many migrant workers supporting her, and some female migrant workers were crying because their captain was injured. However, Tan Wencui forgot her own pain, and she anxiously said to everyone: "Leave me alone, move forward quickly, and completing the task is the most important thing." In the hospital, her left arm was amputated. When the well-wishers asked if her family had any difficulties, she said calmly and happily: "My family is a poor peasant. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party led us to turn over, and we have a good life. I responded to Chairman Mao's call and participated in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. It is an honor to be injured for the people's interests." Her lover, Huang Shunxiang, often came to see her after work, and she always said to him: "Don't delay your work for me, be sure to work hard to do your job well."
    The people's hero was loved and respected by the people. Tan Wencui was named a special-class model worker in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and was approved as a formal member of the Communist Youth League. When she was recuperating in the hospital, leaders, soldiers, workers, Young Pioneer team members, and literary and art workers constantly came to visit her with flowers and letters of condolence. Everyone also used the deeds of Zhao Guilan, the good daughter of the Party, to encourage her. Therefore, she became stronger, and she was determined to learn from Comrade Zhao Guilan. Now she is actively working hard to study culture. On the eve of the Party's birthday, she said in a letter to Chairman Mao: "Although my left arm is broken, I still have a strong right arm, and I am determined to learn to work with one hand."

    "Rescuing National Property is Our Responsibility"
    At noon on June 27th, the Anhui North Branch of the China Grain Corporation's Hefei Sales Department was drying 200,000 jin of new wheat on the drying ground. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and heavy rain was about to fall. If the wheat could not be rushed into the warehouse immediately, the national property would suffer a great loss.
    Workers' group leader Li Yousheng and cadre Ling Yong'an shouted at the same time: "Comrades, rush to harvest the wheat, we must not let national property be lost!" Before they finished speaking, more than 70 workers, more than 20 cadres, and five guards on the drying ground had already taken action.
    More than 20 farmers came to the sales department to sell wheat. Seeing this situation, they automatically put down their own wheat and joined the rush to transport it. Comrade Xu Bailin of the sales promotion team of the department store near the sales department, as well as several carpenters and bamboo craftsmen, also came to help with the rush transport. Zhang Shengyin, a worker at the sales department who was resting in bed, also went to the drying ground after hearing the news of the rush to transport wheat, enduring the pain and sweeping the wheat with one hand.
    More than 120 people worked hard for 40 minutes, and all 200,000 jin of new wheat were rushed into the warehouse, and the national property did not suffer any loss. The comrades in the sales department thanked the farmers and workers who helped with the rush harvest. They all said: "National property is also our own property. Rescuing national property is our responsibility." Jiang Mingdong

    “决心学会用一只手做事”
    ——介绍参加荆江分洪工程的女民工谭文翠
    我在最近访问了被人称为“荆江分洪工程中的赵桂兰”的女民工谭文翠。她在祖国的伟大建设事业中献出了她的左臂。
    谭文翠今年十八岁，生在湖北省秭归县新滩一个贫农家庭中。今年二月底，她到了宜昌市，准备和黄顺祥（建筑工人）结婚。她已经领到了结婚证书。三月上旬，工会号召工人和家属参加荆江分洪工程。黄顺祥响应了工会的号召。谭文翠也到工人家属委员会报了名。他们说：“为了建设祖国，结婚可以延迟些。”他们两个人一起参加了荆江分洪工程的工作。
    谭文翠以惊人的热情投入了祖国伟大的建设事业。她抢着作捞石头、挖土方、搬枕木、扛钢轨等重活。她干完了自己的活，又去帮助别的女民工。晚上，她还担负了巡逻工地的任务。白天黑夜，她紧张地劳动着，正如她自己说的：“吃饭也要咽得快些，好多做些活。”疲乏常常袭击着她，头脑晕眩、眼睛发痛。这时候她想起过去在地主压迫下的苦日子，想起翻身后的好光景，想起毛主席的伟大号召和志愿军的艰苦精神，想起荆江分洪工程完工后的美丽的情景，一种巨大的力量支持着她，她用冷水淋一下头，用湿手巾擦擦眼，立刻又热情地工作起来。
    四月中旬，荆江洪水暴涨。为了抢运国家的器材和物资，大家的工作十分紧张。这时候，谭文翠在黄山头工地轻便铁路上担任运输工作，她已被选为运输大队八中队的中队长。她日夜推运斗车，一连四天三夜没有睡觉。第四天（十八日）夜里，谭文翠推着一车钢筋从藕池口出发。在一个下坡道上，车行很急，她因疲劳过度，晕倒在轨道上。后边的两辆斗车顺着坡冲下来，从她的左臂上碾过去了。她醒来时，发现许多民工扶着她，有的女民工正因她们的队长受伤而哭泣。但是，谭文翠忘掉了自己的疼痛，她着急地对大家说：“别管我，赶快前进，完成任务要紧。”在医院里，她被锯掉了左臂。在慰问者问起她家里有无困难时，她镇静而愉快地说：“我家里是个贫农，毛主席、共产党领导我们翻了身，我们才有好日子过。我响应毛主席的号召，参加了荆江分洪工程。为了人民利益，我受伤是光荣的。”她的爱人黄顺祥时常在完工后来看她，她总是对他说：“不要为我耽误工作，一定要努力把工作做好。”
    人民的英雄受到了人民的热爱和崇敬。谭文翠被评为荆江分洪工程的特等模范，并被批准为青年团正式团员。她在医院疗养时，首长、战士、工人、少年儿童队员、文艺工作者不断地拿着鲜花和慰问信去慰问她。大家并用党的好女儿——赵桂兰同志的事迹来鼓励她。于是，她更坚强了，她下决心要向赵桂兰同志学习。现在她正在积极努力学习文化。在党的生日前夕，她在写给毛主席的信中说：“我的左臂虽然断了，但是还有一只坚强的右臂，我有决心学会用一只手做事。”王敏璋
    “抢救国家财产是我们的责任”
    六月二十七日中午，中国粮食公司皖北分公司合肥门市部正在晒场上翻晒二十万斤新麦，突然，天上乌云密布，大雨就要落下来。如果不能立刻把麦子抢收入仓，国家财产就会受到很大的损失。
    工人组长李友生、干部凌永安同时喊道：“同志们，抢收麦子啊，不能使国家财产受到损失！”他们的话还没有讲完，在晒场上的七十多个工人、二十多个干部、五个警卫战士已经行动起来了。
    有二十多个农民到门市部来卖麦子。他们看见这种情况，自动地放下自己的麦子，参加了抢运工作。在门市部附近的百货公司推销组徐柏林同志，还有几个木匠、篾匠同志，也都来帮忙抢运。躺在床上休养着的门市部工人张盛银听到抢运麦子的消息，也走到晒场上，忍着痛，用一只手扫麦子。
    一百二十多个人紧张地劳动四十分钟，二十万斤新麦全部抢运入仓，国家的财产没有受到一点损失。门市部的同志向帮助抢收的农民和工人们道谢。他们都说：“国家的财产也就是我们自己的财产。抢救国家财产是我们的责任。”姜明东
