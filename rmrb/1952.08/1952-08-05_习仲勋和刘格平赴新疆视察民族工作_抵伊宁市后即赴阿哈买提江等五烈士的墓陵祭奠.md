Xinhua News Agency, Yining, July 29th. Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and Liu Geping, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, arrived in Yining City, a key town in the northwest border of the motherland, Xinjiang Province, on July 28th to inspect ethnic work over the three years since liberation. More than 10,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Yining City warmly welcomed them at the airport.

In a speech at the airport, Xi Zhongxun stated: Thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government, as well as the fraternal unity of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the selfless assistance of the socialist Soviet Union, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been freed from the long-term oppression, exploitation, and enslavement by imperialism, the Manchu feudal dynasty, and especially the Kuomintang reactionary government, and have gained political and economic equality and freedom, becoming one of the masters of the friendly and cooperative family of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China. In the future, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will unite more closely around Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government to build Xinjiang into a more prosperous and happier place. Finally, Xi Zhongxun, on behalf of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, extended his heartfelt greetings to the people of all ethnic groups and the Party, government, and military personnel who bravely and diligently build the frontier of the motherland.

In his speech, Liu Geping pointed out that Xinjiang is a multi-ethnic region, and the religious beliefs and customs of the people of all ethnic groups are different. In the future, the people of all ethnic groups should follow the spirit of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, cooperate closely, respect each other, promote freedom of religious belief, unite all ethnic groups and people from all walks of life who can be united, vigorously develop agriculture, animal husbandry, and cultural and educational undertakings, and strive to build a new Xinjiang.

Saifudin, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, thanked Chairman Mao, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government for their concern and solicitude for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups. He said that the inspection of Xinjiang's work by Vice Chairman Xi Zhongxun and Deputy Director Liu Geping on behalf of Chairman Mao is of decisive significance for consolidating and developing the achievements of Xinjiang's work in the past three years. He called on the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to unite more closely and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Northwest Military and Political Committee, to make more achievements in various construction works, especially in the land reform work in agricultural areas this winter and next spring.

Yining City is located on the western edge of the Junggar Basin and is the source of the national liberation war launched by the people of all ethnic groups in the Yili, Tacheng, and Altay regions against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The city has a population of more than 100,000, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Han, Hui, Mongolian, Russian, Tatar, Xibe, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Manchu, and Solon ethnic groups, making it the second largest city on the northern route of the Tianshan Mountains.

Xinhua News Agency, Yining, July 29th. On the afternoon of July 28th, upon arriving in Yining City, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and Liu Geping, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, went to the mausoleum of revolutionary martyrs Ahmetjan, Iskakh Bek, Abasov, Dalelkhan, and Luo Zhi, who sacrificed their lives for the cause of national liberation and people's democracy, to pay their respects and sweep the tombs, and expressed their condolences to Maenur, the family member of martyr Ahmetjan.

The five martyrs, Ahmetjan, Iskakh Bek, Abasov, Dalelkhan, and Luo Zhi, were leaders of the national liberation war launched by the people of all ethnic groups in the Yili, Tacheng, and Altay regions against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. On August 27, 1949, they were flying to Beijing to attend the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference when their plane encountered a storm and unfortunately crashed. In order to commemorate the five martyrs, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang built a martyrs' mausoleum in the suburbs of Yining City. On the memorial tower in front of the mausoleum, Chairman Mao inscribed a eulogy: "The spirit of comrades Ahmetjan, Iskakh Bek, Abasov, Dalelkhan, and Luo Zhi, who sacrificed their lives for the cause of national liberation and people's democracy, will live forever." This was translated into Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, and Russian languages.
