Hundreds of factories in Shanghai have fully launched safety and hygiene inspection work. This includes state-owned, public, and joint state-private factories belonging to the East China Industrial Department, the East China Textile Administration Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau.

In this safety and hygiene inspection, most factories fully mobilized the masses. Forty-four factories under the East China Industrial Department put forward a total of 72,693 suggestions, including issues related to safety and hygiene, production systems, fire prevention, and public security, as well as many rationalization proposals regarding production. The Huatong Electric Motor Factory alone put forward 69 valuable rationalization proposals during this inspection. For example, the temperature coming from the two large drying cylinders in the third workshop was very high, and the workers felt like they were working in a steamer. The workers proactively came up with a solution by suggesting wrapping a layer of asbestos powder around the ventilation pipes of the large drying cylinders and adding a layer of asbestos powder in the iron door interlayer. This made it less easy for the temperature of the drying cylinders to transmit outwards, lowering the workshop temperature and saving 200 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. Another example is Wu Shimo, a veteran worker from the woodworking shop's fourth group, who suggested adding a movable wooden frame and a fixed wooden frame to the flat iron plate of the circular saw. When working, the movable wooden frame is pushed along the fixed wooden frame, and the dimensions are marked on the side of the wooden frame. This not only makes the work safer but also doubles the work efficiency.

Under the principle of relying on the masses to do a good job in safety and hygiene inspection, the problems solved by the masses themselves in general factories account for more than 60% of the total suggestions. For example, the I-beam iron pillars in the electrolysis department of the Tianyuan and Tianli Chemical Plants were rotten, and replacing them would cost a lot of money. If they were not replaced, it would be dangerous. After group discussion, the workers came up with a solution to make a wooden shell on the outside and pour cement on it, which was equivalent to replacing a new pillar. The three-section furnace body of No. 1 hydrochloric acid furnace of the factory was cracked, and the furnace bottom was completely pulverized. Workers such as Wang Rongfu initially thought that the furnace had to be stopped before it could be repaired, but everyone calculated that stopping it for one day would reduce the production of hydrochloric acid by more than 40 boxes. They used the cool morning to carry out emergency repairs at a high temperature of over 200 degrees Celsius and repaired the furnace.

Through this inspection, the relationship between the factory leaders and the masses has been improved. At the beginning of the movement, some factory workers did not trust the leadership, thinking that "the opinions raised many times in the past were like stones sinking into the sea, and there is no need to raise them again now!" Some said: "If you must ask us to raise them, we will try again. If it is not resolved, this will be the last time we will give our opinion!" However, after the leadership's self-criticism and "mobilizing, inspecting, and solving problems at the same time," the masses' views have changed.

Due to the mobilization of the masses and the improvement of the masses' understanding, new atmospheres have emerged in the production of many factories. The Huatong Electric Motor Factory increased its production efficiency by 25% during the inspection. The average production volume of the Shanghai Tool Factory increased by more than 10% in July and August. The Kiln Department of Tianyuan and Tianli Chemical Plants used to have four people in charge of two kilns, but during the movement, two people were drawn out to do safety and hygiene inspection work. Although the manpower was reduced by half, the work of taking out the kiln was completed three days earlier. At the same time, the workers in the Kiln Department also rushed to repair the fire wall during the movement, saving more than 1,500 refractory bricks.

However, due to the different degrees of importance attached to safety and hygiene work by the leaders of various factories and the inconsistency of the preparatory work for brewing education, the development of the movement is extremely unbalanced. For example, the leaders of textile factories such as Xinhua, Yuantong, and Xinlifeng, and weaving factories such as Xinfeng Weaving Factory and Far East Steel Wire Weaving Factory, did not pay enough attention to this movement, which led to the stagnation of the movement. The state-owned Shanghai No. 7 Cotton Textile Factory and the state-owned Shanghai No. 11 Cotton Textile Factory did not combine the safety and hygiene inspection work with the labor emulation. In particular, the leaders of the state-owned Shanghai No. 11 Cotton Textile Factory repeatedly emphasized the re-election of the trade union and the development of labor emulation, and have not yet devoted the main force to this work. The relevant parties must vigorously correct this.

### 上海数百个工厂展开安全卫生大检查

    上海数百个工厂展开安全卫生大检查
    上海工厂企业安全卫生大检查工作，已在华东工业部、华东纺织管理局、上海市工业局、公用局所属的各国营、公营、公私合营的数百个厂内全面展开。
    在这次安全卫生大检查中，一般工厂均充分发动了群众。华东工业部四十四个厂，共提出了七万二千六百九十三条意见，包括安全卫生、生产制度、消防治安等问题，另外还有很多关于生产上的合理化建议。仅华通电机厂在这次检查中就提出了有价值的合理化建议六十九件。如第三工场内两只大烘缸传出来的温度很高，工人们像在蒸笼里工作，这次工人就主动想办法，建议在大烘缸的通风管外面包上一层石棉粉，在铁门夹层里也放上一层石棉粉，使烘缸的温度不易外传，降低了车间温度，而且每天还可节省二百度电力。又如木工场第四组吴士谟老师傅，建议在圆锯床平铁板上加装活动木架与固定木架，工作时将活动木架沿固定木架推动，同时在木架边上划好尺寸，这样一来，工作时不但安全，且提高了工作效率两倍。
    在依靠群众搞好安全卫生大检查的方针下，一般工厂经过群众自己解决的问题，占整个建议的百分之六十以上。如天原、天利电化厂电解部工字铁柱子烂了，要调换就要花许多钱；不换又有危险，经小组讨论后，工人们想办法在外面做了一个木壳子，浇上水泥，等于换了一根新的柱子。该厂的一号盐酸炉三节炉身破裂，炉底完全粉碎，工人王荣福等开始时认为须将炉子停了才能修理，但大家一算，停一天要少产盐酸四十多箱，他们就利用早晨风凉时，在二百度以上的高温下进行抢修，结果把炉子修好了。
    通过这次检查，改善了各厂领导与群众的关系。在运动刚开始时，有些厂的工人对领导上不信任，认为“过去提了很多次意见都如石沉大海，现在不用再提了！”有的说：“一定要我们提，我们就试试看，再不解决，这就是最后一次意见了！”但是经过领导上的自我检讨，并且“边发动、边检查、边解决”，群众看法也就转变了。
    由于发动了群众，提高了群众的认识，很多工厂生产中已出现了新气象。华通电机厂在检查中，生产效率提高了百分之二十五；上海工具厂七、八月份生产量平均提高了百分之十以上；天原、天利电化厂窑务部原来是四个人管二个窑，但在运动中抽出了两个人做安全卫生的检查工作，虽然人力减少了一半，出窑的工作却提早三天完成；同时，窑务部工人在运动中又抢修火墙，节省了耐火砖一千五百多块。
    但是，由于各厂领导上对安全卫生工作重视的程度不同，酝酿教育的准备工作不一致，因此运动发展得极不平衡。如新华、元通、新利丰等纺织厂，新丰织布厂、远东钢丝织布厂等单位的领导人员，对这一运动重视不足，以致运动陷于停滞状态；国营上海第七棉纺织厂、国营上海第十一棉纺织厂没将安全卫生的检查工作同劳动竞赛结合进行，尤其是国营上海第十一棉纺织厂的领导人员一再强调工会改选和开展劳动竞赛，对这一工作至今仍没拿出主要力量来搞。对此，有关方面必须大力加以纠正。
