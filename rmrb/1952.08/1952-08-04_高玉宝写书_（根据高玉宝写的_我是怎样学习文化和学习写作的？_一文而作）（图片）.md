    Gao Yu Bao Writes a Book (Based on Gao Yu Bao's "How I Studied Culture and Writing?")
    Chen Xinghua, Illustrator
    Thirteen, in November 1947, Fuxian was liberated. During the land reform, my family was allocated land.
    Fourteen, in order to protect our home and land, and to avenge my unjustly deceased grandfather, mother, uncle, and younger brother, I joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army; in January 1948, I joined the Communist Party.
    Fifteen, after joining the army, whenever I received my allowance, I would buy a few old novels to read. During marches, to reduce fatigue, everyone would ask me to tell them stories from the books.

    十三、一九四七年十一月，我们复县解放了。土地改革时我家分到了土地。
    十四、为了保家保田，替屈死的爷爷、母亲、叔叔和弟弟报仇，我参加了中国人民解放军；一九四八年一月，我参加了共产党。
    十五、参军以后，一发了津贴，我就买几本旧小说来看。行军时，为了减少疲劳，大家叫我讲书给他们听。
