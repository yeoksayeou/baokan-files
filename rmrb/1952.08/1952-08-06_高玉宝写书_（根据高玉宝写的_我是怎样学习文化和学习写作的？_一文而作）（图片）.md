    Gao Yu-bao Writes a Book
    (Illustrated based on Gao Yu-bao's article "How I Learned Literacy and Writing")
    Chen Xinghua, Artist

    Nineteen, the "Soldier's Life" series was distributed. Ah! Isn't this the poor people getting published? Seeing the oppression suffered by the protagonist in the book, and thinking of the suffering I had endured in the past, I decided to write a book for my poor brothers to read.

    Twenty, but as soon as I picked up the pen, I couldn't write what was in my heart. I couldn't write seven or eight out of ten characters, and even the ones I could write didn't look like characters. I thought: Gao Yu-bao, you can't even write your own name well, and you still want to write a book? Isn't that a dream?

    Twenty-one, at this time, the communications officer from the Second Battalion brought a manuscript and insisted on a receipt. I wrote the three words "Received today," but couldn't write the word "manuscript." I had no choice but to stamp it with the propaganda section's seal. The communications officer was unhappy, and my heart felt like it was being cut by a knife.

    十九、“战士生活”丛书发下来了，啊！这不是穷人出书了吗？我看见书中主人公所受的压迫，联想到自己过去所受的苦，就决心写一本书叫穷哥们看看。
    二十、可是一动笔，心里的话总是写不出来，十个字有七、八个不会写，写出来的也不像个字。我想：高玉宝，你连自己的名字都写不好，还想写书，这不是作梦吗？
    二十一、这时二营的通讯员送来一份稿子，他一定要收条。我写了“今收到”三个字，再写不出“稿”字。我没有办法，就盖了个宣教股的图章。通讯员不高兴，我心里好像刀割一样难受。
