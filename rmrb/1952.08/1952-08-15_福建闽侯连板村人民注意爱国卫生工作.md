    Fujian Minhou Lianban Village People Pay Attention to Patriotic Health Work

    Editor: In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people of Lianban Village, Minhou District, Fujian, lived in poverty, had backward culture, and did not pay attention to hygiene. Their livestock lived with them, and the courtyards and corridors were full of manure pits and garbage piles. The houses were not cleaned all year round, and flies and mosquitoes filled the air. The ditches stank, excrement was everywhere, and the drinking water river was very dirty. Therefore, people living here often got sick.

    At the beginning of June this year, the village launched a patriotic health campaign. At first, the masses' thinking was still conservative. An old woman named Liu Ruizhen said, "I don't understand what hygiene is. I have never had an injection and have lived to be sixty-five years old." Others said, "Illness and death are all predestined, and talking about hygiene is useless." The village cadres and propagandists, in response to these ideas, used various methods to publicize to the masses. When the masses learned that flies are the "plague gods" that spread diseases such as cholera, they all said, "We didn't know these principles before, and we said that illness was a calamity. Today, we know the importance of hygiene, and we thank Chairman Mao for truly caring about us!" They also said, "If you don't pay attention to hygiene, you will get sick, spend money, harm others, and delay production."

    Once the masses' thinking was cleared, the patriotic health campaign was launched vigorously. The village held two major cleanups, clearing more than 150 loads of garbage. Five stinking ditches were dredged, the underground drains were covered with sand, and the drinking water river was improved by laying stone strips at the water fetching place, clearing weeds from the riverbank, and prohibiting washing dirty things in the river. The manure pits in the village were covered, every household built pigsties, the kitchen was washed every day, the house was swept every day, and everyone changed clothes and bathed regularly.

    In order to keep the patriotic health work regular, inspections are carried out once a week. Clean households are given red paper stickers, while households that do not pay attention to cleanliness are given white paper stickers. At the same time, health lectures are held regularly to educate the masses.

    福建闽侯连板村人民注意爱国卫生工作
    编辑同志：福建闽侯一区连板村过去在国民党反动派统治下，居民生活困苦，文化落后，不注意卫生。他们的牲畜是和人同居的，院子走廊尽是粪缸、垃圾堆，房子终年不打扫，苍蝇、蚊子满天飞；沟渠发臭，粪便满街，饮水河非常肮脏，因此居住在这里的人常常生病。
    今年六月初，该村展开爱国卫生运动。起初群众的思想仍很保守，老太婆刘瑞贞说：“我不懂得什么叫做卫生不卫生，我从来没打过针，也活了六十五岁。”又有人说：“病、死都是命中注定的，讲卫生不顶事。”村干部和宣传员针对这些思想，用各种方式向群众进行宣传。当群众知道了苍蝇是传染霍乱等疾病的“瘟神”时，他们都说：“以前都不知道这些道理，生了病就说是劫数；今天才知道卫生的重要，感谢毛主席真关心我们啦！”又说：“不讲卫生，害了病，花了钱，害了人又误了生产。”
    群众的思想一经打通，爱国卫生运动就轰轰烈烈地展开。该村举行了两次大扫除，清除垃圾一百五十多担，五条臭沟都疏通了，阴沟上都铺上砂土，饮水河也加以改良，打水的地方铺上石条，铲除河边杂草，禁止在河里洗涤肮脏的东西，附近的粪坑都移开。村里的粪坑都加上盖子，家家都修猪圈，厨房日日洗，房屋天天扫，人人都经常换衣洗澡。
    为了使爱国卫生工作保持经常化，每星期进行一次检查，清洁的户口给贴上红纸，不注意清洁的户口则给贴上白纸。同时，还定期举行卫生讲座，教育群众。    林澄
