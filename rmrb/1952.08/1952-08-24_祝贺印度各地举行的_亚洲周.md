    "The people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific region should unite, strengthen and expand the movement to defend peace."
    -- Declaration of the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference

    For more than two hundred years, the people of Asia have suffered from imperialist aggression and endured the pain of oppression and enslavement, and have repeatedly been dragged into the disasters of war. The people have no freedom and happiness, and the country has no independent sovereignty. The friendly economic and cultural exchanges between Asian nations have also been hindered. But the people of Asia have never succumbed. They have carried out long-term and continuous struggles against imperialism.

    After the Second World War, the Chinese people, under the leadership of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, were the first to break free from the shackles of the imperialists, gained freedom and independence, and embarked on the road to prosperity. The lives of the people have also been greatly improved. This proves that if the people of colonies and semi-colonies want to live a happy life, they must completely get rid of imperialist oppression and enslavement.

    The people of Asia have awakened, and the struggle against imperialism has been strengthened, but imperialist aggression has also intensified. The outbreak of the Korean War, the military conflicts in Vietnam and Malaya, and the militarization of Japan and the revival of militarism all threaten the peace and security of the entire Asian region.

    The struggle of the Asian people now has better conditions. This condition is that peace-loving people all over the world, including the people of imperialist countries, have united unprecedentedly and are closely connected with each other, united, and friendly with each other, although the imperialists have been trying to obstruct and isolate them.

    The Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, held in Beijing from June 3rd to 6th this year, further strengthened the efforts and confidence of the Asian people in defending peace. Representatives from 26 countries in Asia, Australia, South America, and North America participated in this preparatory meeting (including some representatives who arrived in Beijing after the general meeting of the preparatory meeting to participate in the work of the meeting). Although the representatives spoke different languages ​​and held various political views and religious beliefs, they all demanded peace and hated war, and unanimously expressed their common will to strive for peace. In their declaration, we can clearly see how determined and confident they are to defend the peace of the Asian and Pacific region. They oppose the use of bacteriological and chemical weapons by imperialist aggressors; they hate the aggressive agreements of war instigators; hate the colonialists' atrocities in suppressing national liberation movements; and hate the imperialists' obstruction of economic and cultural exchanges between countries.

    The representatives of this preparatory meeting unanimously decided to hold the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing in the short term. The decision of this preparatory meeting has been universally approved and cheered by the people of all countries, and has been warmly supported by the people. They are all actively preparing to send representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

    The Indian people have always been a peace-loving people. The Indian people, like the Chinese people, have experienced long-term imperialist aggression and have also suffered from the imperialist threat of war. Therefore, the Indian people have firm confidence and ardent demands for the lofty cause of defending peace. When I participated in the Chinese cultural delegation to visit India last year, I received warm hospitality and welcome. Everywhere we went, the Indian people listened to our reports with such sympathetic and sincere eyes. In pair after pair of bright and upright eyes, we deeply felt the deep friendship and enthusiasm between each other; such friendship and enthusiasm had been maintained for more than two thousand years, and had been obstructed and isolated by the imperialists. How happy we were to see the restoration of friendship that had been obstructed and isolated! Warm hands of friendship, endless hands of friendship were stretched out, scrambling to reach us. In tightly clasped, warm hands, unspoken sympathy and friendship were exchanged. We were so moved that tears gathered in our eyes. To this day, this warm memory is still vivid in my mind.

    Recently, the Indian representatives who returned from the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the peace-loving people of all India jointly held "Asian Week" in various parts of India, making various efforts and preparations for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. When we read in the newspaper the news of "Asian Week" being held in various parts of India, how excited and elated we were! They hold public rallies and parades; they want to prepare for the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference; they also discuss ways to end wars in Asia. Many important representatives from all walks of life belonging to different parties and holding different views have expressed their support for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference; trade unions, farmers' organizations, student unions and women's associations and the broad masses of the Indian people have all enthusiastically responded to and supported the decisions and calls of the "All India Initiating Conference".

    The Indian people's peace-loving movement "Asian Week" is great and enthusiastic. The peace movement, developed on the basis of the Indian people's traditional history of loving peace and opposing aggression, will surely be unprecedentedly strong and will achieve unprecedented achievements. The success of "Asian Week" is beyond doubt.

    How great is the power when India, China, and many other people in Asia and the Pacific region unite to fight for the protection of peace. This is a great force in the cause of defending world peace. If this force is fully utilized, it will be enough to repel any war conspiracy of the war instigators.

    The success of "Asian Week" held in various parts of India is a good sign for the success of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

    Here, I sincerely congratulate the success of the "Asian Week" held in various parts of India, and express my heartfelt admiration to the Indian people who are fighting for peace, as well as the representatives of various parties and groups!

    祝贺印度各地举行的“亚洲周”
    郑振铎
    “亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民团结起来，加强和扩大保卫和平的运动。”
    ——亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议宣言
    亚洲人民二百多年来遭受帝国主义侵略，受尽了被压迫与奴役的痛苦，屡次被拖进大战的灾难中去。人民没有自由和幸福，国家没有独立的主权。亚洲各民族彼此之间的经济文化的友好往来，也遭受了阻碍。但亚洲的人民并没有屈服过。他们进行了长期的不断的对帝国主义的斗争。
    第二次世界大战之后，中国人民在毛泽东和中国共产党领导之下，首先摆脱了帝国主义者的羁绊，获得了自由、独立，走上了繁荣的道路。人民的生活也大大的改善了。这就证明，殖民地半殖民地的人民要想过幸福生活，必须完全摆脱帝国主义的压迫与奴役。
    亚洲的人民觉醒了，对帝国主义的斗争加强了，但帝国主义的侵略也加紧了。朝鲜战争的爆发，越南、马来亚的军事冲突，日本的军事基地化与军国主义的复活，都在威胁着整个亚洲的和平与安全。
    亚洲人民的斗争，现在有了更好的条件。这条件便是全世界爱好和平的人民，包括帝国主义国家的人民在内，已经空前的团结起来，彼此密切的联系着，团结着，友好的往来着，虽然帝国主义者们一直在设法阻碍与隔绝他们。
    今年六月三日至六日在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议，更加强了亚洲人民对于保卫和平的努力与信心。参加这个筹备会议的有来自亚洲、澳洲、南美洲、北美洲二十六个国家的代表们（包括在筹备会议的大会举行之后到达北京参加会议的工作的部分代表）。各位代表虽说着不同的语言，抱着各种不同的政治见解和宗教信仰，但全都要求和平而厌恨战争，一致的表现着争取和平的共同意志。在他们的宣言上，我们明白的看出了他们是怎样坚决而有信心的要保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平。他们反对帝国主义侵略者使用细菌弹和化学武器；他们憎恨战争挑拨者的侵略性协定；憎恨殖民者镇压民族解放运动的暴行；憎恨帝国主义者对各国间经济文化交流的阻挠。
    这个筹备会议的代表们一致决定，短期内在北京举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。这个筹备会议的决定得到了各国人民普遍的赞同与欢呼，得到了人民热忱的拥护。他们都在积极筹备派遣代表到亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议来。
    印度人民一直是爱好和平的人民。印度人民和中国人民同样的经历过长期的帝国主义者的侵略，也同样的遭受帝国主义的战争威胁，因之，印度人民对于保卫和平的崇高事业，具有坚决的信心与热烈的要求。我去年参加我国文化代表团到印度访问的时候，受到了热烈的招待与欢迎。我们每到一个地方，印度人民是那样的以同情与恳挚的眼睛倾听我们的报告。在一对对光亮而正直的眼里，我们深切的感到彼此之间的深厚的友谊与热情；这样的友谊与热情，曾经保持了二千多年之久，而中间是曾被帝国主义者所阻碍与隔绝过的。我们彼此之间是如何高兴的看到被阻碍与隔绝的友谊之重新恢复呀！一只只温暖的友情的手，无穷尽的友谊的手在伸出着，在争抢着伸向我们。在紧握着的，温热的双手里，交流着无言的同情与友情。我们感动得热泪在眼眶中聚集着。至今，这温暖的回忆还宛在目前。
    最近，从亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议回去的印度代表们和全印度爱好和平的人民共同在印度各地举行“亚洲周”，为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议作种种的努力与筹备。我们在报纸上看到那一条条的印度各地举行“亚洲周”的消息，是如何的兴奋与欢欣鼓舞！他们举行公众集会和游行；他们要为即将举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议做好准备工作；他们还讨论结束亚洲境内战争的办法。许多属于不同党派具有不同见解的各方面重要代表人物，都表示支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议；各地工会、农民组织、学生联合会和妇女协会以及广大印度人民，全都热烈响应和拥护“全印发起会议”的决定和号召。
    印度人民的爱好和平运动的“亚洲周”是伟大的，是热烈的。在印度人民传统的爱好和平、反对侵略的历史基础上发展起来的和平运动，一定会是空前的壮大，并会获得空前的成就的。“亚洲周”的成功是无可怀疑的。
    印度和中国，还有许多其他亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，团结起来为保护和平而奋斗，那力量是多末大。这是保卫世界和平事业中一支极大的力量。这种力量如果充分发挥出来，足够打退战争挑拨者的任何战争阴谋。
    印度各地举行的“亚洲周”的成功，正预示着亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成功。
    我在这里恳挚的祝贺印度各地举行的“亚洲周”的成功，并对为和平而奋斗的印度人民，以及各党派、各团体的代表们致衷心的钦佩之意！
