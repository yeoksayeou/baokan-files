To the Editorial Board, forwarding this to all comrades, our elder brothers in the People's Liberation Army:

We are very happy to write this letter. As your reserve force, we feel proud and honored. Our patriotic pledge, made by all the militiamen in our village, reads: "Ready at any time to answer the call of the Motherland and join our elder brothers in the People's Liberation Army in going to the forefront to defend the Motherland."

Under the leadership of the Party and your influence, we are growing stronger every day. Take our Beima Village as an example; we now have one hundred and sixty-one militiamen. During the reorganization in May this year, we formed three detachments and ten squads. We democratically elected a battalion commander, detachment commanders, squad leaders, and study group leaders. Our commander, Dong Qingzhang, is a glorious Communist Party member. He was awarded the title of combat hero during the struggle against the Yan bandit in 1946 and was twice recognized as a model militiaman by the Linfen Military Sub-district. Last year, he also participated in the National Day review in Beijing. Our study progress is quite good. We have two political classes, one military class, and six cultural classes each month. We have already studied "A Brief History of the Communist Party of China" and "Political Teaching Materials," and we recently studied the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention." Our class consciousness has been raised, and we recognize the importance of the people's armed work and our own significant responsibilities. We have established a club and a sports field. These cultural, recreational, and sports activities have strengthened our bodies and enhanced our collectivist education.

Most of the militiamen in our village are the backbone of the production front. We have responded to Chairman Mao's call to get organized and develop production. One hundred and one of us have joined agricultural mutual aid teams, with thirty of us serving as team leaders. Thanks to getting organized, production efficiency has improved. This year's wheat harvest was completed quickly, freeing up a lot of time to plant more than 500 mu of autumn crops. In previous years, each person could only hoe 2.1 mu of land per day, but this year we can hoe 3.4 mu. We have hoed our cotton fields four times!

You defend the security of the Motherland on the national defense front, while we maintain public order in the rear and work hard to produce. We took over the work at your homes long ago. We take very good care of the crops of military families. Qiao Yushan, a military family member, harvested 7 dou and 9 sheng of wheat per mu, which is 2 dou more than the average person. Your parents are our parents; with us here, you don't have to worry about family life.

Dear elder brothers, the "August 1st" Army Day is coming. This is your birthday and our birthday. All the militiamen in our village held a meeting on the evening of July 9th and decided to commemorate this festival with the following practical actions: (1) Study the fighting history of our elder brothers in the People's Liberation Army and use you as an example to train ourselves; (2) Further improve the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families in our village; (3) Consolidate agricultural mutual aid teams and continue to increase production. We guarantee to do these three tasks well as a gift to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day.

Dear elder brothers! When we see the thriving autumn seedlings, when we see our mothers, who have suffered for half their lives, eating peacefully on their kangs, when we see the children with rosy cheeks carrying their schoolbags to school, we deeply feel that this happiness is not easy to come by. This is the result of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party and your bloodshed, sacrifice, and heroic struggle. We must cherish it and build our Motherland even more beautifully. We know that there are still remnants of reactionaries lurking domestically who want to destroy our happy lives, and there is still American imperialism committing murder and arson at our doorstep in Korea. We must not be paralyzed; we must hold our guns tightly and defend the people's country!

Elder brothers! When we write this letter, the family members of martyrs and soldiers ask us to pass on a message: "Life at home is very good, don't worry, and we hope to hear from you often."

Finally, all the militiamen in our village swear to you:

In order to defend the great Motherland and our beloved Chairman Mao, all 161 militiamen in our village are ready at any time to answer the call of the Motherland and go to the forefront to defend national defense!

We extend our warm regards to you! And wish you victory in combat and study!

All Militiamen of Beima Village, Fourth District, Linfen County, Shanxi Province.

    “随时准备响应祖国的召唤，走上保卫祖国的最前线！”
    山西临汾县北麻村民兵庆祝“八一”向解放军致敬编辑同志转解放军老大哥全体同志：
    我们写这封信的时候，心里十分高兴。作为你们的后备力量，我们感到骄傲和光荣。我们全村民兵的爱国公约上写着：“随时准备响应祖国的召唤，和解放军老大哥一起走上保卫祖国的最前线。”
    我们在党的领导和你们的影响下，日益壮大起来了。就拿我们北麻村来说吧，就有一百六十一人。今年五月整顿组织，我们编了三个分队，十个小队。我们民主选举了大队长、分队长、小队长和学习组长。我们的队长董清章是个光荣的共产党员。他在一九四六年和阎匪进行斗争的时候，得过战斗英雄的称号，并曾被临汾军分区两次评为模范民兵，去年还到北京参加了国庆节的检阅典礼。我们的学习情况相当好。每月上两次政治课、一次军事课、六次文化课。我们已经学习了“中国共产党简史”和“政治教材”，最近又学习了“三大纪律，八项注意”。我们的阶级觉悟提高了，认识了人民武装工作的重要性和自己的重大责任。我们建立了俱乐部和体育场。这些文化娱乐和体育活动，锻炼了我们的身体，加强了我们的集体主义的教育。
    我村民兵大部分都是生产战线上的骨干分子。我们响应了毛主席组织起来发展生产的号召，有一百零一人参加了农业互助组，其中有三十人担任了组长。由于实行了组织起来，生产效率提高了，今年麦收很快完成了，还腾出很多工夫，种了五百多亩回茬秋庄稼。往年每人每天只能锄二亩一分地，今年能锄三亩四分。我们的棉花都锄了四遍啦！
    你们在国防战线上保卫祖国的安全，我们在后方维持治安并努力生产。我们早把你们家里的活包下来了。我们对军属的庄稼照顾得非常好。军属乔玉山每亩麦子收了七斗九升，比一般人多收二斗。你们的父母就是我们的父母；有我们在，你们就不用牵挂家庭的生活了。
    亲爱的老大哥们，“八一”建军节来到了。这是你们的生日，也是我们的生日。我们全村民兵在七月九日晚上开了会，决定用下列实际行动来纪念这个节日：（一）学习人民解放军老大哥的斗争历史，拿你们做榜样来锻炼自己；（二）进一步作好本村拥军优属工作；（三）整顿农业互助组，继续提高生产。我们保证把这三件工作作好，作为庆贺八一建军节的献礼。
    亲爱的老大哥们！当我们看见旺盛的秋苗，看见我们受了半辈子苦的母亲们在炕上安稳地吃饭的时候，看见孩子们红光满面、背起书包上学的时候，我们深深感到这些幸福得来的不易。这是毛主席、共产党的英明领导和你们流血牺牲，英勇斗争的结果。我们一定要好好保卫它，把祖国建设得更美丽。我们知道：国内还潜伏着想破坏我们幸福生活的反动派的残余，国外仍有美帝国主义在我们的大门口——朝鲜杀人放火。我们决不能麻痹，一定要握紧枪杆，保卫人民的天下！
    老大哥们！当我们写这封信的时候，烈属军属大爷、大妈们让我们捎上一句话：“家里生活挺好，不要惦念，盼望常听到你们的消息。”
    最后，我们全村民兵向你们宣誓：
    为了保卫伟大的祖国和我们敬爱的毛主席，我们全村一百六十一名民兵随时准备响应祖国的召唤，走上保卫国防的最前线！
    向你们致以热烈的敬礼！并祝你们战斗、学习胜利！
    山西临汾县四区北麻村全体民兵
