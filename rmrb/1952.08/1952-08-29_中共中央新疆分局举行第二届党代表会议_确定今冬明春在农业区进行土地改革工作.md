    The Second Xinjiang Party Congress of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Xinjiang Sub-bureau was victoriously concluded on August 5th.
    Under the personal leadership of Xi Zhongxun, Second Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Liu Geping, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, the conference comprehensively reviewed and summarized the leadership work of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau over the past two years, and determined to carry out land reform in the agricultural areas of Xinjiang with a population of four million people this winter and next spring.
    The conference fully promoted intra-party democracy and conducted criticism and self-criticism. The conference believes that the work of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau has been successful in the past two years, mainly reflected in: stabilizing the social order in agricultural areas, and the unity of all ethnic groups has been increasingly consolidated and strengthened. On the basis of ethnic unity, mass mobilization and education have been organized through production movements, the Resist-America Aid-Korea campaign, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; in particular, the rent reduction and anti-local tyrant movement in the winter and spring of last year established the dominance of farmers in about one-third of the rural areas in agricultural areas, and developed the power of farmers in two-thirds of the rural areas. The masses of farmers of all ethnic groups generally have the demand for land reform. In the past two years or so, in addition to sending a large number of cadres from the interior and the army to participate in local work, more than 16,000 local cadres of various ethnic groups have been trained, nearly 1,000 party members and 12,000 Communist Youth League members have been developed. Under the cultivation and education of the party, these local ethnic cadres have been tempered by actual struggles, and their political awareness and working ability have gradually improved. At the same time, the conference strictly criticized the shortcomings and errors that had occurred in the work. These shortcomings and errors were mainly reflected in the work in pastoral areas where the correct policy of prudence and stability of the CPC Central Committee and the Northwest Bureau failed to be adhered to, and an adventurous and radical wrong policy was adopted.
    The conference successively listened to Xi Zhongxun’s report on "Conveying the Central Instructions and Opinions on Xinjiang Work" and the reports made by Liu Geping and others on ethnic and religious issues, military production issues, united front work issues, financial and economic construction issues, and cultural and educational work issues. Each delegation conducted repeated discussions on the above-mentioned special reports. On the basis of clarifying the work guidelines and correcting the policy ideas, Zhang Bangying, the Third Secretary of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau, made a "Report on the Implementation of Land Reform in Agricultural Areas of Xinjiang Province," and Bao Erhan made a "Report on Work in Pastoral Areas of Xinjiang." Each delegation conducted detailed discussions on the above reports and unanimously agreed that it is now the urgent demand of farmers of all ethnic groups throughout Xinjiang to concentrate all efforts this winter and next spring to eliminate the land system of feudal exploitation by the landlord class in the vast agricultural areas of Xinjiang and establish a land ownership system for farmers. The conference determined that the implementation of land reform should become the central task of the Party's work in the agricultural areas of Xinjiang at present.
    The conference determined that the policy and task for the work in pastoral areas at present and for a long period to come is: to wipe out bandits, suppress current counter-revolutionary criminals, stabilize social order, and protect animal husbandry including pastoral owner economy; carry out patriotic education and medical and trade work; train local ethnic cadres, gradually build democratic power, and unite all those who can be united and won over; strive to develop animal husbandry and, where possible, appropriately improve the lives of herdsmen and poor herdsmen. The conference clearly recognized that the pastoral economy is a semi-feudal and semi-capitalist economy, and the conference stipulated that the pastoral owner economy should not be struggled against or divided, the pastoral area should not be divided into classes, the policy of benefiting both pastoral owners and herdsmen should be implemented, the feudal privileges of pastoral owners should be gradually abolished, and the production enthusiasm of pastoral owners should be encouraged to develop the animal husbandry economy. All adventurous and radical practices against the pastoral owner economy must be resolutely opposed.
    The conference also focused on discussing the issue of strengthening the unity between Han cadres and local ethnic cadres. The conference believes that the key to the unity of all ethnic groups lies in the close unity of Han cadres and local ethnic cadres, and the unity of cadres depends on the prevention and overcoming of great-Han chauvinism by Han cadres to influence and promote local ethnic cadres to actively overcome narrow nationalism. Therefore, the conference called on all Han cadres to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, study the Party's theories and policies on ethnic issues and the working experience of other minority ethnic areas; at the same time, they must intensify their efforts to learn the local ethnic languages and characters, rely on and help local ethnic cadres, cooperate closely, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, so as to strengthen close ties with the masses of people of all ethnic groups and serve the people of all ethnic groups wholeheartedly.
    In order to achieve the above objectives, the conference finally unanimously adopted the "Resolution on the Implementation of Land Reform in Agricultural Areas of Xinjiang," "Resolution on Work in Pastoral Areas of Xinjiang," and "Decision on Preventing and Overcoming Great-Han Chauvinism."

    中共中央新疆分局举行第二届党代表会议
　　确定今冬明春在农业区进行土地改革工作
    中国共产党中央新疆分局召开的第二届全疆党的代表会议，已在八月五日胜利闭幕。
    会议在中共中央西北局第二书记习仲勋，中共中央统一战线工作部副部长刘格平的亲自领导下，全面地检查和总结了新疆分局过去两年多来的领导工作，确定了今冬明春在新疆四百万人口的农业区进行土地改革工作。
    会议充分发扬了党内民主，进行了批评与自我批评。会议认为：两年多来新疆分局的工作是有成绩的，主要表现在：安定了农业区的社会秩序，各族人民的团结日益巩固和加强了。在民族团结的基础上，通过生产运动、抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动，组织、教育了群众；特别是去冬今春的减租反恶霸运动，在农业区约三分之一的农村，树立了农民的优势，在三分之二的农村也都发展了农民的势力，各族农民群众，普遍有了实行土地改革的要求。二年多以来，除由关内和部队中抽派大批干部参加地方工作外，还培养了一万六千多名本地的各民族干部，发展了近一千多名党员和一万二千名青年团员，这些本地的民族干部在党的培养和教育下，得到实际斗争的锻炼，政治觉悟和工作能力都逐渐提高。会议同时严格地批判了工作中曾经发生过的缺点和错误，这些缺点和错误主要表现在牧区工作上未能坚持贯彻中共中央和西北局的慎重稳进的正确方针，而采取了冒险急进的错误方针和政策。
    会议先后听取了习仲勋关于“传达中央指示及对新疆工作意见”的报告，和刘格平等所作的关于民族宗教问题、军队生产问题、统一战线工作问题、财经建设问题、文教工作问题的报告。各代表团分别对上述专题报告进行了反复的讨论。在明确了工作方针和端正了政策思想的基础上，接着由新疆分局第三书记张邦英作了“关于新疆省农业地区实行土地改革的报告”，鲍尔汉作了“关于在新疆牧区工作的报告”。各代表团对上述报告进行了细致的讨论，一致认为：今冬明春，集中一切力量，在全疆广大农业区消灭地主阶级封建剥削的土地制度，建立农民的土地所有制度，已是全疆各族农民当前的迫切要求。会议确定实行土地改革应成为目前党在新疆农业区工作的中心任务。
    会议确定在目前以及今后一个长时期内对牧区工作的方针和任务是：肃清土匪，镇压反革命现行犯，安定社会秩序，保护包括牧主经济在内的畜牧业；开展爱国主义教育和医疗、贸易工作；培养当地民族干部，逐步建设民主政权，团结一切可以团结和争取的人士；努力发展畜牧业，在可能条件下，适当地改善牧工和穷苦牧民的生活。会议明确认识了牧区经济是半封建的半资本主义的经济性质，会议规定：对牧主经济不斗不分，不划分牧区阶级，实行牧主牧工两利政策，逐步取消牧主封建特权，鼓励牧主的生产积极性，以发展畜牧业经济。一切对牧主经济的冒险急进的做法，都必须坚决反对。
    会议还集中讨论了关于加强汉族干部与本地民族干部的团结问题。会议认为：各民族团结的关键，在于汉族干部与本地民族干部的亲密团结，而干部的团结又决定于汉族干部防止和克服大民族主义倾向，以影响和推动本地民族干部主动地克服狭隘民族主义倾向。因此，会议号召全体汉族干部应该努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，学习党的有关民族问题的理论、政策和其他少数民族地区的工作经验；同时必须加紧学会本地民族的语言文字，依靠和帮助本地民族干部，亲密合作，取长补短，从而加强与各民族人民群众的紧密联系，全心全意为各族人民服务。
    为达到上述各项目的，会议最后一致通过了“关于新疆农业区实行土地改革的决议”、“关于在新疆牧区工作的决议”、“关于防止和克服大民族主义倾向”的决定。　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
