Making Policy Based on False Reports Inevitably Leads to Errors
Suggesting that the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government Examine the Lessons from Last Year's Disaster Relief Work

To the Editor: Several areas of Suiyuan Province suffered from droughts, pests, hailstorms, winds, and frost in the autumn of last year, resulting in widespread crop reduction. The Suiyuan Provincial People's Government led the masses to implement production self-rescue and overcome the disaster. This was completely correct. However, the Provincial People's Government initially overestimated the severity of the disaster, and therefore adopted some inappropriate measures. The blind transfer of grain alone caused very serious losses to the state and the people. Now I am telling you about this matter, hoping to draw the attention of relevant authorities.

After the natural disasters occurred last year, leading cadres from many special districts (leagues), counties (banners) of the Suiyuan Province People's Government reported the disaster situation to higher authorities. Many areas intentionally exaggerated the extent of the disaster in order to receive more relief grain and bear less agricultural tax, attempting to use this erroneous method to reduce the difficulties and responsibilities in future disaster relief work. The Suiyuan Provincial People's Government did not have a sufficient understanding of the actual situation, and did not conduct in-depth investigation and research on the disaster reports from various places, so it made an estimate that the average harvest of the province was only 45%, with a total grain shortage of 300 million jin. In order to solve the grain problem within the province, the Provincial People's Government raised grain prices in the province to prevent grain outflow; at the same time, it instructed grain companies and cooperatives to order grain from the inland areas. From October last year to the end of March this year, grain companies and cooperatives purchased more than 78 million jin of grain from Northeast China and other places.

What was the actual situation? Last year, the average harvest in Suiyuan Province was not 45%, but 60% to 70%. Suiyuan Province has a lot of land and a small population. As long as there is a 60% or 70% harvest, farmers will have surplus grain to sell. The Ikezhao League Autonomous Region originally reported only 30% harvest, with a grain shortage of 95 million jin; it has now been verified that the league not only does not lack grain, but also has more than 2 million jin of grain in storage to sell, and farmers also have more than 1 million jin of grain that cannot be sold. The grain transferred in by the grain company therefore had to be transferred out again in its entirety.

The losses caused by the blind transfer of grain are very serious. The round-trip transportation of more than 60 million jin of grain by the Suiyuan Provincial Branch of the Grain Company alone resulted in losses of more than 10 billion yuan in transportation, loading and unloading, tools, and storage costs. If the losses incurred in regional and seasonal price differences are also included, the figure would be even larger. The grain company and cooperatives purchased grain from other regions and accumulated a large amount of capital, so they no longer had the capacity to purchase surplus grain from farmers, which directly affected the lives of farmers. Farmers in the Ikezhao League Autonomous Region have about one million jin of grain (this is an agricultural and pastoral area, so the amount of surplus grain is not large) that cannot be sold. Farmers in Sarachi County also have surplus grain to sell. Farmers lack cash and are generally engaged in barter transactions. Cooperatives have suffered greatly restricted supplies due to inflexible capital turnover, which caused dissatisfaction among members. The Junwang Banner Cooperative had a total of 230 million yuan in capital, but 300 million yuan was tied up in grain alone. As a result, it had to borrow money from the bank to maintain business.

Now, the various agencies of Suiyuan Province are educating cadres and examining bureaucratic work styles through the "Zhang Shunyou Incident." I suggest that they also conduct a thorough examination of this issue in order to learn from the lessons and improve their work.

Editor's Note: The incident in which the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government formulated a disaster relief work plan for the entire province based on false reports from lower-level governments, causing serious losses to the state and the people, deserves everyone's vigilance.

This matter illustrates two issues: First, some staff members of government agencies in Suiyuan Province have not yet established a correct view of being seriously responsible for the people's cause. They still cannot correctly handle the relationship between local interests and overall interests. In order to reduce their responsibilities and difficulties in disaster relief work, and to take care of the interests of the disaster victims in their areas, they consciously made false reports to the higher authorities, exaggerating the disaster situation, which caused the leading organs to deviate in policy decisions. This bad style must be overcome. Second, what is especially noteworthy is that the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government demonstrated a serious bureaucratic work style in deciding this issue. The task of the leading organs is to grasp the situation and decide on policies. The Suiyuan Provincial People's Government did not go deep into the grassroots to understand the true situation of the disaster, and did not conduct serious analysis and research on the situation reports from below. It made decisions based on these false reports, and as a result, mistakes occurred. We suggest that the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government learn from the lessons of this incident and take appropriate measures to conduct an in-depth examination, so as to educate cadres and improve their work.

    根据假报告决定政策必然发生错误
    建议绥远省人民政府检查去年救灾工作中的教训
    编辑同志：绥远省若干地区在去年秋季遭受了旱、虫、雹、风、冻等灾害，农作物普遍减产。绥远省人民政府领导群众，实行生产自救，战胜了灾荒。这是完全正确的。但是，省人民政府最初对灾情估计过重，因此采取了若干不适当的措施。仅仅盲目调运粮食一项，就使国家和人民遭受到十分严重的损失。现在我把这件事告诉你们，希望引起有关机关的重视。
    去年天灾发生后，绥远省很多专区（盟）县（旗）人民政府的领导干部纷纷向上级汇报灾情。很多地区有意地夸大灾情的程度，借以多领救济粮，少负担农业税，企图用这种错误的方法，减少今后救灾工作中的困难和责任。绥远省人民政府对实际情况了解不够，对各地汇报的灾情也没有进行深入的调查研究，就作出全省平均收成仅四成半，总共缺乏粮食达三亿斤的估计数。省人民政府为了解决境内的粮食问题，提高了省内的粮价，以防止粮食外流；同时指令粮食公司和合作社等部门，分别到内地订购粮食。从去年十月到今年三月底，粮食公司和合作社从东北等地购入粮食达七千八百多万斤。
    实际情况是怎样呢？去年绥远省的平均收成不是四成半，而是六至七成。绥远省土地多、人口少，只要能有六七成年景，农民就有余粮出卖。伊克昭盟自治区原来报告只有三成年景，缺粮九千五百万斤；现在查明，该盟不仅不缺粮，而且还有二百多万斤库存粮要出卖，农民手里也有一百多万斤粮食卖不出去。粮食公司调进来的粮食，因此不得不再全部调出。
    因为盲目调运粮食而造成的损失是十分严重的。仅粮食公司绥远省分公司往返调运的六千多万斤粮食，在运输、装卸、工具、保管等费用上的损失就有一百亿元以上。假若把地区差价和季节差价上所受的损失也计算在内，那么数字就更大了。粮食公司和合作社从外区购买粮食，积压了大量资金，因此，再没有力量收购农民的余粮，这就直接影响到农民的生活。伊克昭盟自治区的农民约有一百万斤粮食（这里是农牧区，所以余粮数目不多）卖不出手。萨拉齐县的农民也有余粮卖不出去，农民缺乏现款，普遍地进行着以物易物的交易。合作社因为资金周转不灵，供应业务受到很大的限制，引起了社员的不满。郡王旗合作社共有资金二亿三千多万元，仅粮食一项就积压了三亿多元，结果只好向银行贷款来维持业务。
    现在，绥远省各机关，正通过“张顺有事件”来教育干部，检查官僚主义作风。我建议他们对这一问题也进行深刻检查，以便接受教训改进工作。
    柳崖明
    编者按：绥远省人民政府根据下级政府的假报告制订全省的救灾工作计划，使国家和人民遭受了严重损失的事件，值得引起大家的警惕。
    这件事情说明了两个问题：第一、绥远省某些政府机关的工作人员还没有树立对人民事业严肃负责的正确观点，他们还不能正确地处理局部利益和整体利益的关系，他们为了减轻自己在救灾工作中的责任和困难，为了照顾本区灾民的利益，竟然有意识地向上级作了夸大灾情的假报告，使领导机关在决定政策时发生了偏差。这种恶劣的作风必须加以克服。第二、尤其值得注意的是，绥远省人民政府在决定这个问题时，表现了严重的官僚主义作风。领导机关的任务是掌握情况，决定政策。绥远省人民政府没有深入下层了解灾情的真实情况，对于下面的情况报告，又没有进行认真的分析研究，就根据这种假报告决定了政策，结果发生了错误。我们建议绥远省人民政府接受这件事情的教训，采取适当的办法，进行深入的检查，以便教育干部，改进工作。
