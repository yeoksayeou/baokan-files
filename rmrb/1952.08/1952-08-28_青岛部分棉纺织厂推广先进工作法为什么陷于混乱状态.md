Why the Promotion of Advanced Working Methods in Some Cotton Textile Factories in Qingdao Has Fallen into a State of Chaos
　　Miao Xiangtao, Ding Wen, Qian Dadong

Recently, the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Qingdao Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, and the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Chinese Textile Workers' Union, among other units, organized an advanced working method inspection team. They focused on inspecting the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method and the 1951 Weaving Working Method in the state-owned Qingdao Second Cotton Textile Factory and the Fifth Cotton Textile Factory, with an emphasis on the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method.

During the inspection, it was found that many spinning workers were operating according to the Hao Jianxiu Working Method, especially the workers of the Third Factory, who implemented it relatively well. However, many spinning workers were no longer following the Hao Jianxiu Working Method, and their operating methods were chaotic. Many workers did not have a fixed pattern of patrolling while watching the machines, and they ran around inside the machine aisles specifically to catch broken ends. Workers watching multiple machines also did not have a fixed patrol route, sometimes patrolling both sides and sometimes only one side. Many workers did not diligently wipe the boards during operation, and some even put the wiping board in their apron pocket, only taking it out to wipe when they remembered. Cleaning work was generally done poorly; workers rarely did cleaning work during working hours, and some even came to work early to do cleaning work, sometimes as much as forty or fifty minutes or an hour early. Because the Hao Jianxiu Working Method was not implemented, they could not work proactively and with a plan. As a result, the labor intensity of the workers increased, and there were more roller flowers, empty spindles, and empty rovings. The Fifth Factory even produced about two thousand pieces of bad yarn a day. During the inspection at the Fifth Factory, the inspection team immediately discovered twenty-one empty rovings and sixty-five empty spindles.

Why do such chaotic operating methods still exist among the workers of various cotton textile factories in Qingdao? The main reason is that leading cadres in various factories have developed complacency and relaxed their leadership in promoting advanced working methods. Seeing that most workers had already "learned" the Hao Jianxiu Working Method and that roller flowers had been reduced to an "unprecedented" level, they believed that "the promotion was almost done" and that "there was nothing more to do." Wang Jun, the director of the Second Factory, said in his self-criticism: "The reason we relaxed our leadership in promoting advanced working methods was because we saw that the roller flowers had been reduced a lot and thought that the workers were already doing very well in implementing the Hao Jianxiu Working Method." The factory's management committee has not had a single special discussion on promotion work to this day; the factory's trade union only briefly mentioned the issue of promoting the Hao Jianxiu Working Method in two of its eighty-four committee meetings, and it never discussed the 1951 Weaving Working Method at all. The factory's working method inspection team had no one to lead them; when the "little teachers" discovered problems, they had nowhere to report them, and no one looked at the measured forms. After measuring for half a year, the results of the measurement were only announced once.

Many cadres also have the following view: "Now it is not a question of consolidating and further familiarizing workers with the Hao Jianxiu Working Method, but rather of how to improve and develop it." Therefore, some cadres, although they themselves did not fully understand the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method, blindly believed that it was a "development" of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method and a result of "flexible application" when they saw that some workers' operating methods were not completely the same as the Hao Jianxiu Working Method, and yet the roller flowers were occasionally produced less. Some workers, who were not very familiar with the Hao Jianxiu Working Method to begin with, heard that they should "apply it flexibly" and regarded not patrolling and not wiping the boards as "flexible application" as well. Some individual workers with conservative ideas even used "flexible application" as an excuse to simply not implement the Hao Jianxiu Working Method at all. In such a situation, how could the workers' implementation of advanced working methods not be chaotic!

The leading cadres of some factories only called for attention to promotion work in words and at meetings, but they did not do concrete work. In the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method at the Fifth Factory, workers raised many opinions on technical management and other aspects, but the workshop Party, administrative, trade union, and Youth League cadres only called on everyone to study, without solving specific problems. Huang Renmei, the labor model who was newly promoted to workshop administrator, told the workshop director about the problems that the workers wanted the administration to solve, but the workshop director said, "You are also administration!" and immediately shut him down. Recently, due to the change from two shifts to three shifts, the number of machines watched by spinning workers in various factories has increased, and some changes are therefore needed in the operating methods, but the leading cadres of the various factories have not studied these issues, leaving the workers to do it themselves.

In response to the above situation, the leading cadres of the various cotton textile factories in Qingdao should immediately conduct a thorough inspection of the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method and the 1951 Weaving Working Method, and should focus on exposing and criticizing complacency and incorrect understanding of the promotion of advanced experience. At the same time, it is necessary to criticize the phenomenon of not first learning the basic methods of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method, but instead engaging in a separate set of immature working methods, re-explaining the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method to the workers, and clearly stipulating the patrol routes for multiple machines, etc., so that the workers can earnestly and correctly implement the Hao Jianxiu Working Method. In addition, it is also necessary to establish and improve the organization and various systems for promoting advanced experience, and to carry out the in-depth promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method and the 1951 Weaving Working Method in an organized and planned manner.

    青岛部分棉纺织厂推广先进工作法为什么陷于混乱状态
    缪祥焘　丁文　钱大东
    最近，中国共产党青岛市委员会、青岛市总工会、华东纺织管理局青岛分局、中国纺织工会青岛市委员会等单位，组织了先进工作法检查组，重点检查了国营青岛第二棉纺织厂和第五棉纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法的情况，并着重检查了推广郝建秀工作法的情况。
    在检查中，发现许多细纱工人是按照郝建秀工作法操作的，特别是三厂的工人，执行得比较好。但是也有不少的细纱工人已不按郝建秀工作法做了，操作方法混乱。许多工人在看车时没有一定的巡回规律，专门为了抢接断头，在车档内乱跑。看多台车的工人，也没有一定的巡回路线，忽而双面巡回，忽而单面巡回。很多工人操作时不认真打擦板，个别工人甚至把擦板放在围裙布袋内，想起来就拿出来打一下。清洁工作一般做得很差，工人在工作时间内很少做清洁工作，有些工人提前上班来做清洁工作，甚至有早来四、五十分钟和一个钟点的。由于没有贯彻郝建秀工作法，就不能主动而有计划地工作，结果，工人劳动强度增加，皮辊花和空锭、空粗纱也都多了。五厂一天竟出坏纱二千个左右。检查组在五厂检查时，瞬间就发现空粗纱二十一个，空锭六十五个。
    为什么青岛各棉纺织厂的工人中，还存在着这种操作方法上的混乱现象呢？主要原因是各厂领导干部滋长了自满思想，放松了对推广先进工作法的领导。他们看到过去大部分工人已经“学会了”郝建秀工作法，皮辊花也“空前”地降低了，便认为“推广得差不多了”，“没啥可做了”。二厂王均厂长在检讨中说：“我们所以放松了对推广先进工作法的领导，就是因为看到皮辊花已降低了很多，以为工人执行郝建秀工作法已经很好了。”该厂管理委员会，至今没有专门讨论过一次推广工作；厂工会在八十四次委员会会议中，只有两次简单地提到推广郝建秀工作法的问题，对一九五一织布工作法根本没有讨论过。厂的工作法检查组没有人领导，“小先生”发现问题时没处汇报，测定出的表格没有人看，测了半年只公布了一次测定的结果。
    还有许多干部有这样的一种看法：“现在不是巩固和进一步使工人熟练郝建秀工作法的问题，而是怎样提高和发展它的问题了。”因而，有些干部虽然自己对郝建秀工作法基本精神尚不十分了解，但看到个别工人有些操作方法和郝建秀工作法不完全一样，而皮辊花又偶尔出得少，便盲目地认为是“发展了”郝建秀工作法，是“灵活运用”郝建秀工作法的结果。有些工人本来对郝建秀工作法就不十分熟练，听说要“灵活运用”，就把不巡回、不打擦板也看成是“灵活运用”了。个别思想保守的工人，更假借“灵活运用”，就根本不执行郝建秀工作法了。在这样情况下，工人执行先进工作法怎能不混乱呢！
    有些厂的领导干部，只在口头和会议上号召重视推广工作，但没有做好具体工作。五厂在推广郝建秀工作法中，工人对技术管理等方面提出很多意见，但车间党、行政、工会、青年团干部只号召大家学习，不解决具体问题。新提升为车间管理员的劳动模范黄人美，把工人要求行政解决的问题告诉车间主任，车间主任说：“你也是行政呀！”一下就把别人给堵回去了。各厂最近因为由二班改三班，都增加了细纱工人的看车台数，在操作方法上因而也需要有某些改变，但各厂领导干部都没有研究过这些问题，让工人自己去做。
    针对以上情况，青岛各棉纺织厂领导干部应即对郝建秀工作法、一九五一织布工作法的推广工作进行一次彻底的检查，并要着重揭发和批判自满思想和对推广先进经验的不正确认识。同时，要批判那些不首先学会郝建秀工作法的基本方法，而另外搞一套不成熟的工作法的现象，重新向工人讲解郝建秀工作法的基本精神，并要明确规定多台车的巡回路线等，使工人认真而正确地执行郝建秀工作法。此外，又必须建立和健全推广先进经验的机构和各项制度，有组织有计划地深入推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法。
