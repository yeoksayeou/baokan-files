The Propaganda Department of the CCP Chahar Provincial Committee held a Party History Instructor Training Class from April 21st to May 30th. A total of 57 instructors were trained, most of whom were county-level cadres. They generally had a long work history, rich experience in struggle, were familiar with the Party's policies, and had strong comprehension abilities. The training class's learning method was to focus on major key issues in various revolutionary periods, selectively read some of Chairman Mao's works, and clarify the development of the Party's line and policies and the application of strategies, so that the students' thinking was focused on understanding the formation and development of Mao Zedong Thought, and its greatness and correctness. At the same time, students were guided to learn how to master Chairman Mao's scientific thinking methods. At the beginning of the training class, many students came with the idea of "peddling goods," wanting to know some "strange and secret stories" that ordinary people didn't know, so they desperately grabbed materials without studying key issues. Others were specifically looking for mistakes, thinking they were experienced and knowledgeable, making random comments, and raising issues and erroneous legends that had nothing to do with Mao Zedong Thought. When they didn't get an answer, they expressed dissatisfaction and said, "This study is very disappointing!" These erroneous learning attitudes were criticized in several study and inspection meetings, and they were all corrected. At the end of the study, everyone wrote a political paper.

Due to adhering to the correct learning policy, the students made relatively large gains in their thinking in this training class, had a certain degree of understanding of Mao Zedong Thought, and also gained some necessary experience in guiding the study of Party history. This is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

First, they clarified that the purpose of studying Party history is to study Mao Zedong Thought and deepened their understanding of the Chinese revolution. Some people used to think that we had won victory only by courage and hard work. After studying, they realized that the basis of our victory was Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. From studying the development process of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's theories in various fields, the students more specifically realized that Chairman Mao's scientific thinking method is a sharp weapon for the Party to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, after studying, most of the students deeply felt that they must work hard to study Chairman Mao's thinking method, and only by working according to Chairman Mao's thinking method can their work be successful.

Second, they had a deep understanding of the harm of petty-bourgeois thought to the revolution. In the past, many comrades did not understand the Party's struggle against "left" and right opportunist erroneous lines from a fundamental standpoint. After this study, they recognized its ideological roots and class basis. Some people believed that the essence of petty-bourgeois thought was good, "but the way the petty-bourgeoisie carried out the revolution was not good." Now they realized that the development of petty-bourgeois thought within the Party would inevitably cause serious harm to the revolution. Many students also examined the petty-bourgeois thoughts and styles that existed in themselves, such as individual heroism, "left" and right swings in the implementation of policies, subjectivism in work, and the ups and downs of work enthusiasm, and wanted to work hard to overcome them.

Third, policy thinking was improved. Chairman Mao's change in the united front strategy in the later period of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the application of the united front strategy during the Anti-Japanese War and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, and the mastery of policies in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements profoundly educated all the students. For example, some students reviewed that their past understanding of the Party's policy towards the bourgeoisie was only a theoretical issue and had no practical significance. Two students even understood Chairman Mao's policy of both unity and struggle for a long time as a policy of "preventing the right with the left" and "preventing the left with the right." When they specifically reviewed the "left" and right leaning emotions in their current understanding of the policy towards the bourgeoisie, the "left" said: We now have control of the state power, what are we afraid of? It is not very meaningful to unite with the bourgeoisie. In the past, uniting was to have one more friend and one less enemy. The right said: Since we are friends, it would be good to enter socialism together, why struggle? These erroneous understandings were basically corrected in the study. Everyone felt that correctly mastering policies is the foundation of victory, and replacing policies with feelings is a very dangerous thing that must be strictly corrected.

Fourth, they attached importance to theoretical study. In the study, some erroneous understandings of theoretical study were exposed, mainly empiricism. There was the so-called "you can do work without studying theory," "studying theory is dogmatism, just talking about it verbally, and it is not useful in actual work"; some said: "Studying policies has a direct effect on current work, studying theory has no effect, mastering the overall situation requires theory, my small situation only needs policies"; some said: "Theory is a very high thing, unattainable, and cannot be learned at all." etc. After this study, everyone increasingly felt the importance of studying theory and the importance of the connection between theory and practice. They also had a more correct understanding of the relationship between policies and theory.

Fifth, in guiding discussions, reviewing, reading, taking notes, and answering questions, the students also gained the necessary experience. Among them, holding good study and inspection meetings was an important experience. It not only examined individual learning gains and learning attitudes, and criticized an incorrect learning ideology, but also guided the review of certain common tendencies in actual work and study, such as ignoring theoretical study and separating policies from theory, and other empiricist tendencies. Holding good inspection meetings is of great help to teaching and learning leadership, and to the consolidation and improvement of students' learning gains.

This training class also had serious shortcomings: First of all, it did not put Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" at the forefront for serious study, and the lectures were not deep or systematic, and the enlightening effect was not great. Secondly, the time was short, the workload was heavy, there were many lectures and little self-study, and it was not possible to read carefully and study Chairman Mao's works in more depth. The number of lectures on the theory and policies of economic construction and Party building was also too small. The leadership did not go deep into the groups to organize everyone to raise questions, and some individual group leaders even restricted the raising of questions, affecting the in-depth understanding of the questions. Ideological criticism was also not done enough, and fewer questions were answered. Some students had a very bad attitude towards learning, and no strict ideological criticism was carried out. Finally, the lecturers lacked in-depth and detailed research on Chairman Mao's works, and could not yet more specifically and systematically expound Mao Zedong Thought in their lectures. In explaining historical events, they sometimes regarded accidental and unimportant events as the main factors of historical events, ignoring the great role of the Party's strength and revolutionary policies. These are all things that should be paid attention to in the future.

    中共察哈尔省委宣传部举办党史教员训练班的一些收获
    中共察哈尔省委宣传部从四月二十一日至五月三十日举办了一次党史教员训练班，训练班受训教员共五十七人，大部分都是县委级干部。他们一般都是工作历史较长，有较丰富的斗争经验，并且熟习党的政策，理解能力较强。训练班的学习方法是通过各个革命时期的重大关键问题，有重点地选读毛主席的若干著作，阐明党的路线、政策的发展和策略的运用，使学员的思想集中于领会毛泽东思想的形成、发展，和它的伟大、正确。同时引导学员学会掌握毛主席的科学的思想方法。训练班开始时期，很多学员是抱着“贩货”思想来的，想知道一些一般人不知道的“奇闻秘事”，因此只拚命抓材料，不去钻研关键问题。另有个别同志则是专找错误，以为自己经验多见识广，乱发议论，提些与毛泽东思想毫无关系的问题和错误的传说。得不到答复就表示不满，并说：“这次学习，大失所望啊！”对这些错误的学习态度经多次学习检查会作了批判，都得到了纠正。学习终结时，大家并作了政治论文。
    这次训练班由于坚持了正确的学习方针，学员在思想上的收获是比较大的，对毛泽东思想都有了一定程度的领会，也取得了指导党史学习的一些必要经验。主要表现在以下几个方面：
    一、明确了学习党史的目的就是学习毛泽东思想，并加深了对中国革命的认识。有些人过去以为我们是只凭勇敢和艰苦取得了胜利的，经过学习才认识到我们胜利的基础是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。学员们从学习毛泽东思想的发展过程和毛主席在各个方面的学说中，更具体地体会到毛主席的科学的思想方法，是党解决中国革命问题的利器。因而绝大部分学员在学习之后，已都深感必须努力学习毛主席的思想方法，也只有按毛主席的思想方法进行工作，才能使自己的工作胜利。
    二、对小资产阶级思想对革命的危害性有了深刻的认识。过去许多同志对党内反对“左”、右倾机会主义错误路线的斗争是没有从根本立场来了解的；经过这次学习认识了它的思想根源和阶级基础。有些人认为小资产阶级思想本质是好的，“不过小资产阶级干革命的方式是不好的”；现在认识到小资产阶级思想在党内的发展，必然使革命遭到严重危害。很多学员并检查了自己所存在着的小资产阶级的思想和作风，如个人英雄主义，在执行政策上的“左”右摇摆，工作中的主观主义，工作情绪的忽冷忽热等，并要努力克服它。
    三、政策思想提高了。毛主席在第二次国内革命战争后期在统一战线策略上的转变，在抗日时期及第三次国内革命战争中统一战线策略的运用，“三反”、“五反”运动中的政策的掌握，都深刻地教育了所有的学员。如有的学员检讨过去对党对资产阶级政策的认识以为只是个理论问题，没有实际意义。有两个学员更是长时期地把毛主席的又团结又斗争的政策，了解成“以左防右”和“以右防左”的政策。特别检讨到目前对资产阶级政策认识上的“左”右倾情绪时，“左”的说：我们现在掌握了国家政权还怕什么，联合不联合资产阶级意义不大了，过去联合是为了多一个朋友，少一个敌人。右的说：既是朋友了，一道进入社会主义好了，何必斗争。这些错误认识，在学习中基本上被纠正了。大家感到：正确掌握政策是胜利的基础，以感想代替政策是十分危险的事情，必须严格纠正。
    四、对理论学习重视了。在学习中暴露了对理论学习的一些错误认识，主要是经验主义。有所谓“不学理论也可以作工作”，“学理论是教条，只口头上说说，实际工作上用不着”；有的说：“学政策对当前工作有直接作用，学理论没有作用，掌握大局面需要理论，我这点小局面有政策就行了”；有的说：“理论是非常高的东西，可望而不可即，根本学不会。”等等。经过这次学习，大家都越来越感到学理论的重要，感到理论与实践联系的重要了。对政策与理论的关系也有了比较正确的认识。
    五、在指导讨论、复习、读书、作笔记、解答问题等方面，也使学员取得了必要的经验。其中开好学习检查会，是一项重要经验。不仅检查了个人的学习收获、学习态度，对一种不正确的学习思想展开批评，还可引导检讨在实际工作中和学习上的某些普遍倾向，如忽视理论学习、把政策与理论分割等经验主义的倾向。开好检查会，对讲授和学习领导，对学员学习收获的巩固和水平的提高，都有很大的帮助。
    这次训练班也有严重的缺点：首先是没有把毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”放在最前面来认真学习，讲的也不深刻、不系统，启示作用不大。其次是时间短，分量重，讲授多，自学少，不能精读和更深入地钻研毛主席的著作。对经济建设的理论、政策和党的建设等问题，讲授的次数也太少。领导上没有深入小组，组织大家提问题，有些个别组长甚至限制提问题，影响对问题的深入了解。思想批判工作也做得不够，解答问题少。有几个学员学习态度很不好，也没有进行严格的思想批判。最后，讲授的人对毛主席的著作缺少深入细致的研究，在讲授上还不能够更具体地系统地阐述毛泽东思想。在解释历史事件上，还有时候把偶然的和不重要的事件当作历史事件的主要因素，忽视了党的力量和革命政策的重大作用。这都是今后应注意的。
