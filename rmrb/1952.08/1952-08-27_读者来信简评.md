	(1) The Importance of Increasing and Protecting Livestock
	The letter published in today's newspaper, "The People in the Old Revolutionary Base Areas of Xing County, Shanxi Province, Request the Government to Solve the Difficulty of Buying Sheep," reflects a very important situation. This letter raises the important question of how to vigorously develop animal husbandry in a planned way and effectively solve the current phenomenon of livestock supply falling short of demand, which is one of the important issues urgently to be resolved. In the three years since liberation, thanks to the vigorous promotion of the People's Government, China's animal husbandry has greatly developed. It has played a significant role in supporting and improving agricultural production, supplying industrial raw materials, and improving people's lives. With the rapid development of animal husbandry, the number of livestock needed and purchased by the masses has also greatly increased. Therefore, livestock supply falling short of demand is a common phenomenon at present. Although some livestock can be exported from producing areas, the lack of planning still prevents the reasonable solution of the needs of the masses in other areas.
	The reason why some old revolutionary base areas in Shanxi Province cannot buy sheep despite receiving livestock loans is related to the above-mentioned basic situation. However, it also exposes the blindness of the relevant departments in Shanxi Province in their livestock loan work. On the one hand, they do not fully understand the basic situation of the current shortage of sheep and have not instructed the counties on how to correctly use livestock loans. On the other hand, they also lack specific organizational leadership in the work of purchasing sheep. Therefore, before issuing loans, they did not consult with sheep-producing areas and relevant leading departments to determine the number and areas of sheep that could be purchased, but blindly issued loans to the masses, allowing them to purchase them everywhere, causing waste of manpower and material resources and arousing public dissatisfaction.
	The fundamental issue in developing animal husbandry is to strengthen the protection of livestock, improve feeding management, and increase livestock reproduction rates, rather than simply increasing livestock through purchase. Only by reducing livestock mortality and increasing reproduction rates can we open up a broad road for the vigorous development of animal husbandry. People's governments at all levels should widely publicize to the masses the great significance of patriotic livestock breeding and protection, and earnestly implement methods for rewarding breeding to protect existing livestock.
	Secondly, in order to reasonably allocate the sheep that can be exported from certain areas, all regions should organize the purchase and sale of sheep in a led and planned manner. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government should be responsible for grasping the numbers and situations of sheep purchased and sold in various regions and carry out unified regulation; the exporting or importing regions should responsibly report the specific situation to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, and at the same time must oppose departmentalism that only emphasizes the needs of the region and disregards the overall interests. In this way, we can completely overcome the difficulties in development.
	(2) Oppose the Barbaric Act of Corporal Punishment of Students
	Implementing corporal punishment and disguised corporal punishment on children is a barbaric act of feudalism, imperialism, and fascism that enslaves and destroys children. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Abolishing Corporal Punishment of Students" on February 14. However, according to readers' letters to this newspaper, corporal punishment of students continues to occur to this day. Some local educational administrative organs have taken necessary measures to deal with this, which is correct. However, some have not taken a serious attitude in dealing with this erroneous behavior; individual educational administrative cadres even advocate disguised corporal punishment. This is a problem that deserves attention.
	The reason for this situation is that some educators have not undergone strict ideological transformation. They lack the necessary understanding and sense of responsibility for the people's education cause, and lack the necessary care and enthusiasm for children. They use the bad, crude, and barbaric methods brought from the old society to replace the education and cultivation of children. Some educational administrative cadres also lack the necessary understanding of the harm of corporal punishment to students, so this erroneous behavior that damages the normal physical and mental development of children has not been corrected in a timely manner.
	In order to protect the second generation of New China and implement the Ministry of Education's "Instructions on Abolishing Corporal Punishment of Students," on the one hand, primary school teachers must thoroughly eliminate the reactionary ideas brought from the old society, correct their irresponsible work attitude, and thus improve teaching methods, and use their own words and actions to infect and cultivate children's new moral character and conscious discipline. On the other hand, local education administrative departments should strictly implement the Ministry of Education's instructions, call on all teachers to fight against the barbaric act of corporal punishment of students, and give those teachers who repeatedly refuse to correct their mistakes the punishment they deserve.

专栏：读者来信简评

    （一）增殖与保护牲畜的重要性
    本报今天发表的“山西兴县老根据地群众要求政府解决买不到羊群的困难”的来信，反映了一个十分重要的情况。这封来信向我们提出了：如何有计划地大力发展牧畜事业，有效地解决目前牲畜供不应求的现象，是急待解决的重要问题之一。解放三年来，由于人民政府的大力提倡，我国畜牧事业有了很大的发展，它在支援和提高农业生产，供给工业原料和改善人民生活等方面，都起了重大的作用。随着畜牧业的迅速发展，群众需要和购买牲畜的数量也大大增加，因此，牲畜供不应求是目前的普遍现象。产区的牲畜虽可输出一部分，但由于缺乏计划性，仍不能合理地解决外地群众的需要。
    山西省部分老区群众领到畜牧贷款却买不到羊群，其原因固然与上述基本情况有关，但同时也暴露了山西省有关部门在发放畜牧贷款的工作中存在着盲目性。他们一方面对目前羊群缺乏的基本情况了解不够，没有指示各县如何正确地使用牲畜贷款；另一方面，他们对购买羊群的工作，也缺乏具体的组织领导。因之他们没有在发放贷款之前，与羊群产区和有关领导部门互相协商，确定可以购买的羊群数字和地区，而是盲目地把贷款发放给群众，让群众自己到处购买，造成了浪费人力物力，引起了群众不满。
    发展牧畜事业的根本问题，是加强保护牲畜，改善饲养管理，提高牲畜繁殖率；而不是单纯地以购买的方法来增加牲畜。只有减少牲畜死亡而又提高了繁殖率，才能为大力发展畜牧事业开辟广阔的道路。各地人民政府应该广泛地向群众宣传爱国增畜保畜的重大意义，并切实贯彻奖励繁殖的办法，保护现有牲畜。
    其次，为了合理地分配某些地区可以输出的部分羊群，各地区应该有领导有计划地组织羊群的购销工作。中央农业部应负责掌握各地购销羊群的数字和情况，进行统一的调剂；输出或输入的地区应该负责地向中央农业部报告具体情况，同时也必须反对只强调本区需要而不顾全局利益的本位主义思想。这样，在发展中的困难，我们就完全可以克服它。
    （二）反对体罚学生的野蛮行为
    对儿童施行体罚和变相体罚，是封建主义、帝国主义、法西斯主义奴化儿童、摧残儿童的野蛮行为。中央人民政府教育部在二月十四日曾发出“关于废止对学生体罚的指示”。但是，根据本报读者来信反映，体罚学生的情况至今仍不断发生，若干地区的教育行政机关，对此作了必要的处理，这是正确的。有的却对这种错误行为还没有采取严肃的态度来处理；个别教育行政干部甚至还提倡变相体罚。这是一个值得重视的问题。
    发生这种情况的原因，是一部分教育工作者没有经过严格的思想改造，他们对人民教育事业缺乏应有的认识和责任心，对儿童没有应有的爱护热情。他们用的是旧社会带来的恶劣、粗暴、野蛮的方法，来代替对儿童的教育和培植。而某些教育行政干部，也因为对体罚学生的危害性缺乏应有的认识，使这种损害儿童身心正常发展的错误行为未能及时被纠正。
    为了保障新中国的第二代，贯彻中央教育部“关于废止对学生体罚的指示”，一方面，小学教员们必须彻底肃清从旧社会带来的反动思想，纠正不负责任的工作态度，从而改进教育方法，通过自己言论、行动，去感染和培养儿童新的道德品质和自觉的纪律性。另一方面，各地教育行政部门应该严格执行教育部的指示，号召全体教员向体罚学生的野蛮行为进行斗争，并给那些屡戒不改、坚持错误的教员以应得的处分。
