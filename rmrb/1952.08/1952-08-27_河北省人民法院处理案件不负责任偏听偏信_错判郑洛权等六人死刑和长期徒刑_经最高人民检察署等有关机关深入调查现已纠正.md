The Hebei Provincial People's Court, in handling a case of injury resulting in death that occurred in Anguo County during the 1947 land reform movement, wrongly sentenced the defendants Zheng Luoquan and five others to death, life imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment because it only listened to the false accusation of Zheng Yi, the family member of the deceased. This triggered extreme dissatisfaction among the local masses, who filed numerous appeals to the Central Government. After a thorough investigation by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government, together with the party and government organs of Hebei Province and relevant special districts, counties, and districts, the entire facts of this false accusation case have been ascertained, proving that the judgment of the Hebei Provincial People's Court was completely wrong.

The plaintiff, Zheng Yi, is a Communist Party member and former Deputy Instructor of the Hebei Provincial Military Region, residing in Mendong Village, Anguo County. In 1948, he accused Zheng Luoquan, a party cadre in the village, and Xu Guanqing, an activist in the poor peasant association, in the Anguo County People's Court, of deliberately exaggerating Zheng Yi's family's class status and instigating the murder of Zheng Yi's elder brother, Zheng Shenghua, during the land reform in Anguo County in 1947. He also accused Zheng Luoquan of "colluding with the puppet captain during the enemy-puppet rule to report on the activities of our army"; "leading the enemy to arrest worker Li Xiaobei, giving a gun to the enemy, and urging union cadres to surrender"; "when enemy agents arrested Wang Peishan, Wang escaped to the alley entrance, but was grabbed by Zheng Luoquan"; and "actively burying our side's enemy work personnel, Mr. Ma, alive." Zheng Yi personally went to the Anguo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, firmly demanding that Zheng Luoquan be executed. After investigation, the Anguo County Committee found that Zheng Yi's accusation did not match the facts and refused to process it, and it remained unresolved. Later, the case was transferred by the Dingxian Special District Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court for direct handling. Zheng Yi repeatedly requested the Dingxian Branch to execute Zheng Luoquan. After investigation, the Dingxian Branch still found significant discrepancies in the facts and made a decision at the end of 1949, believing that the death of Zheng Shenghua had nothing to do with the defendants Zheng Luoquan, Zheng Jicang, and Liu Zhebin. Although Zheng Jicang had beaten Zheng Shenghua, it was only due to the general mass emotion during the vigorous land reform movement and should not be punished. The defendant Xu Guanqing should be sentenced to two years imprisonment for hanging and beating Zheng Shenghua due to personal grudges. Before the verdict could be announced, the defendants' families directly petitioned the Supreme People's Court to order the Hebei Provincial People's Court to handle the case because the case had been delayed for too long.

After accepting the case, the Hebei Provincial People's Court sent personnel to Mendong Village in April 1950, together with relevant organs of the special district and county, for a seven-day investigation. However, due to the lack of a realistic spirit and a responsible attitude towards the people on the part of the court's leadership and case handlers, they only listened to one side and were subjectively arbitrary. They did not seriously study the actual investigation materials already available from the Dingxian Special District Branch. Merely because the plaintiff Zheng Yi was a long-time revolutionary cadre, they concluded that the defendants Zheng Luoquan and others must not be good people. Therefore, during the investigation, they only paid attention to collecting materials unfavorable to the defendants, and they simply did not listen to other materials. When some people in Mendong Village and nearby villages reflected the true situation to them, they ignored them, arbitrarily believing that they were "favoring" and "harboring" the defendants and "conspiring" with each other. They contacted twenty-seven people during the investigation, nine of whom were colluded with by Zheng Yi and dissatisfied with Zheng Luoquan for other reasons, five were landlords and rich peasants, two were Zheng Yi's family members, and there were also members of reactionary secret societies. In the interrogation and deliberation, they used Zheng Yi's false accusations and the untruthful reflections obtained during the investigation as the sole basis, and did not pay attention to the various facts presented by the defendants Zheng Luoquan and others. They arbitrarily said that they were "cunning," "denying the facts," and "luring the masses," and handcuffed the defendants Zheng Jicang and others to force confessions. When the defendants Zheng Luoquan and others consistently denied the crimes fabricated by Zheng Yi, the Hebei Provincial People's Court made a shocking judgment in December 1951 in an extremely irresponsible manner: "The defendant Zheng Luoquan served as an enemy liaison officer in 1941, colluded with enemy and puppet captain Li, reported on the activities of our army, assisted the enemy in arresting district cadre Wang Peishan, and plotted to murder village cadres out of hatred, is sentenced to death and deprivation of political rights for life; Xu Guanqing is sentenced to life imprisonment for actively participating in and arranging the murder of village cadres out of hatred; Zheng Luoshuai and Liu Zhebin are each sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for actively participating in the murder of village cadres in order to be loyal to Zheng Luoquan and use their cadre positions; Zheng Jicang is sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for beating village cadres to death in order to realize the intentions of Zheng Luoquan and others; Zheng Kuchuang is sentenced to three years imprisonment for participating in the murder of village cadres out of resentment."

During the detention of Zheng Luoquan and others, party members, cadres, and masses from Mendong Village and six or seven nearby villages, as well as the defendants' families, repeatedly submitted petitions to the Hebei Provincial People's Court and relevant organs, appealing and guaranteeing that Zheng Luoquan was a cadre who had always been loyal to the revolution, and demanding that the case be handled quickly and realistically. After the erroneous judgment of the Hebei Provincial People's Court was announced, the masses were in an uproar and immediately appealed to the Central Government.

After learning of this situation, the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government sent a letter to the Hebei Provincial People's Court on March 28th of this year, ordering the temporary suspension of the case; and on March 31st, it sent personnel to conduct investigations in more than fifteen villages in the local area, together with staff from the province, special district, county, and district. All the places mentioned in the case were visited and investigated one by one. The families of the plaintiff and defendants in the case, landlords and rich peasants who were detained and imprisoned in the same room with Zheng Shenghua at the time, militiamen and poor peasant representatives who guarded the detained landlords and rich peasants, relevant cadres who led the work in the village during the Anti-Japanese War, as well as relevant party members, cadres, and masses in neighboring villages, were all investigated and interviewed as much as possible. Finally, it was confirmed that Zheng Yi's accusations against Zheng Luoquan and others were completely false.

According to the large amount of materials obtained from the investigation, Zheng Luoquan was not a bad element who betrayed and surrendered to the enemy, but a cadre who had always been loyal to the revolution. He participated in village government work shortly after the "July 7th Incident." Later, when Mendong Village became a guerrilla base, he continued to persist in the anti-Japanese struggle and was elected as the anti-Japanese village chief by the masses in 1940. He was consistently active and responsible in his work. He won a model banner for his good performance in expanding the army and implementing the unified progressive tax. He established elementary schools and people's schools in the village and conscientiously implemented the policy of rent and interest reduction. After the Japanese invaders carried out the "May 1st" Great Purge in 1942, the environment became even more difficult, and he was appointed as the village chief responsible for resisting the enemy by the organization. In the long-term, acute struggle against the enemy, he often escorted our cadres across the blockade line and rescued anti-Japanese cadres Wang Xingfan, Zhu Guitong, and Ma Luanshan, and often sheltered our party and government responsible cadres in the village. The party and government work in the village was never disrupted, and he had made certain contributions. He had been contacted by the puppet army Li Wenhuan on behalf of the organization, but he did not "collude with the puppet captain to report on the activities of our army." He also did not "lead the enemy to arrest worker Li Xiaobei," but tried to bail Li Xiaobei out when he was arrested and beaten by the enemy. The arrest of district cadre Wang Peishan was not because he grabbed Wang, but because enemy agents wanted him to help chase Wang Peishan. He used his wit, pretended to fall, and managed to get by. The Mr. Ma who Zheng Yi claimed was buried alive has now been identified as a running dog of a traitor and special agent. The local masses hated him to the core and repeatedly demanded his elimination. With the consent of the anti-Japanese government, he was executed by Zheng Luoquan and others with the assistance of the district team leader. The death of Zheng Yi's elder brother, Zheng Shenghua, was also found to have nothing to do with Zheng Luoquan. The fact is that during the land reform in Mendong Village in the winter of 1947, Zheng Yi's family was classified as rich peasant due to exploitation and abuse of hired workers (later changed to prosperous middle peasant during correction). Zheng Shenghua, Zheng Shenglu, and other landlords and rich peasants in the village were detained at the same time. Zheng Shenghua suffered a mental breakdown during his detention and attempted to seize a gun and escape, resulting in a conflict with the militiamen. Two passing soldiers were staying nearby and, upon hearing that landlords and rich peasants were seizing guns, angrily helped the militiamen beat Zheng Shenghua. Only Zheng Jicang, Xu Guanqing, and Zheng Luoshuai were present at the time among the defendants, and the other three, Zheng Luoquan and others, had nothing to do with the matter. After Zheng Shenghua died due to his injuries, the masses feared retaliation from Zheng Yi, so the poor peasant association and the new peasant association suggested to the work team to bring Zheng Yi back from the army and detain him in the village. Later, because the crime was not serious, he was sent to the county for detention for a few days and then allowed to return to work in the army. However, Zheng Yi harbored resentment because of this and was determined to retaliate. After returning to the army, he fabricated facts and falsely accused Zheng Luoquan and others to the county.

There is also a historical reason why Zheng Yi wanted to falsely accuse Zheng Luoquan. During the Anti-Japanese War, when Zheng Luoquan was the village chief, Zheng Yi's family did not pay the hired workers half of their wages in kind as required, and the hired workers accused him. The district fined his family several bolts of native cloth, and Zheng Luoquan stood on the side of the hired workers and advocated the fine. On another occasion, a dispute occurred in Zheng Yi's family, and the result of Zheng Luoquan's mediation was not favorable to Zheng Yi's family. Once, due to a dispute in Zheng Yi's family, Zheng Luoquan spoke out against injustice during the mediation and slapped Zheng Yi and his mother. As early as after the liberation of Anguo in 1946, Zheng Yi, based on the above-mentioned personal grudges, falsely accused Zheng Luoquan of being a traitor and colluding with the enemy. At that time, the county judicial section did not investigate the matter clearly and hastily sentenced Zheng Luoquan to five years imprisonment. However, Zheng Yi was still not satisfied and attempted to kill Zheng Luoquan with a guillotine. After Zheng Shenghua was beaten and died, Zheng Yi took the opportunity to falsely accuse Zheng Luoquan again. This fact fully demonstrates Zheng Yi's despicable malice and his complete loss of the qualities that a Communist Party member and revolutionary soldier should have.

After clarifying the above situation, the Supreme People's Procuratorate immediately made suggestions to the Supreme People's Court and the North China Branch, requesting a retrial of the case. Upon receiving the instructions from the higher court, the Hebei Provincial People's Court convened a mass meeting in Mendong Village on August 11th and publicly announced the revocation of the original judgment and the acquittal and release of Zheng Luoquan and five others. Zheng Yi was sentenced to three years imprisonment for malicious false accusations. The Hebei Provincial Military Region and the Military Region Party Committee also announced the expulsion of Zheng Yi from the military and the party. Zheng Luoquan and others who suffered losses due to the false accusations have been appropriately compensated by the local government. The local masses unanimously support this just handling.

    河北省人民法院处理案件不负责任偏听偏信
    错判郑洛权等六人死刑和长期徒刑
    经最高人民检察署等有关机关深入调查现已纠正
    河北省人民法院在处理安国县一九四七年土地改革运动中发生的一件伤人致死案中，由于偏听了死者家属郑义的诬告，错误地判处被告郑洛权等六人死刑、无期徒刑和有期徒刑，引起当地群众的极端不满，纷纷向中央申诉。经中央人民政府最高人民检察署会同河北省及有关专区、县、区的党政机关派人到当地详细调查，已经查明这一诬告案的全部事实，证明河北省人民法院的判决是完全错误的。
    原告郑义是共产党员，原任河北省军区副教导员，家住安国县门东村。一九四八年，他向安国县人民法院控告该村党员干部郑洛权和贫农团积极分子徐贯卿等在一九四七年安国县进行土地改革时故意提高郑义的家庭成份，主谋杀死郑义的哥哥郑生华。同时还控告郑洛权在敌伪统治时期“和伪大队长勾结，报告我军活动情况”；“领敌抓捕工人李小辈，将枪送与敌人，并促工会干部自首”；“敌特抓捕王培山时，王逃跑到胡同口，被郑洛权上去将他抱住”；“主动活埋我方敌工人员马先生”。郑义曾亲去中共安国县委会，坚决要求将郑洛权处死。安国县委会调查后，发现郑义的控告和事实不符，即予拒绝，一直没有处理。以后该案由河北省人民法院定县专区分院调去直接处理。郑义又曾多次要求定县分院处死郑洛权。定县分院调查后，仍发现事实出入很大，在一九四九年底作出决定，认为郑生华之死与被告郑洛权、郑吉苍、刘哲彬无关。郑吉苍虽曾打过郑生华，但只是由于在轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动中一般群众性的激愤情绪所造成，不应判罪，被告徐贯卿因私人成见吊打郑生华，应判处徒刑两年。该判决尚未公布，被告家属即因案件拖延太久，迳自呈请最高人民法院转令河北省人民法院处理。
    河北省人民法院受理该案后，曾于一九五○年四月派人会同专区、县有关机关到门东村调查了七天。但由于该院领导上和承办人员缺乏实事求是的精神和对人民负责的态度，偏听偏信，主观武断，不认真研究定县专区分院已有的实际调查材料，仅仅根据原告郑义是多年的革命干部，即断定被告郑洛权等一定不是好人，因而在调查中只注意收集对被告不利的材料，其他材料根本听不进去。门东村和附近村庄有的群众向他们反映真实情况，他们都置之不理，武断地认为是“偏袒”、“包庇”被告，互相“串供”。他们在调查中共接触了二十七人，有九个是郑义串通好的和因其他原因不满郑洛权的人，五个是地主、富农，两个是郑义的家属，还有反动会道门分子。在审讯和评议中，即把郑义的诬告材料和调查所得的不真实的反映当成唯一的依据，对被告郑洛权等所提出的种种事实不予重视，武断说他们“狡猾”、“抵赖”，“拉拢群众”，并给被告郑吉苍等上手铐来逼供。在被告郑洛权等始终不承认郑义捏造的罪状时，河北省人民法院竟在一九五一年十二月极不负责地作出了骇人听闻的判决：“被告郑洛权一九四一年充敌联络员，与敌伪李队长勾结，报告我军活动情况，复协助敌人抓捕区干部王培山及挟仇主谋策划杀害村干部之所为，判处死刑，褫夺公权终身；徐贯卿为挟仇积极参与及布置杀害村干部之所为，判处无期徒刑；郑洛帅、刘哲彬为效忠郑洛权，利用干部职权积极参与杀害村干部之所为，各处有期徒刑二十年；郑吉苍为实现郑洛权等意图，毒打村干部致死之所为，处有期徒刑十年；郑苦床为挟嫌参与杀害村干部之所为，处有期徒刑三年。”
    在郑洛权等人被扣过程中，门东村和附近六、七个村庄的党员、干部、群众和被告家属曾多次向河北省人民法院和有关机关呈递意见书，奔走申诉，一致保证郑洛权是一贯忠实于革命的干部，要求实事求是地迅速处理该案。河北省人民法院的错误判决公布后，群众大哗，立即上告到中央。
    中央人民政府最高人民检察署得悉这一情况后，于今年三月二十八日函告河北省人民法院，将该案暂时停止进行；并于三月三十一日派员会同省、专、县、区的工作人员，共同到当地十五个以上的村庄进行了调查。凡是该案中所提到的地点，都一一前往调查。该案原告和被告的家属，当时和郑生华同时被扣和同屋拘押的地主、富农、看管被扣地主、富农的民兵和贫农代表，抗日时期领导该村工作的有关干部，以及邻近各村的有关党员、干部和群众，凡是能够找得到的，都一一作了调查访问。最后肯定了郑义对郑洛权等人的控告完全是诬告。
    根据调查所得的大量材料，郑洛权并不是叛变投敌的坏分子，而是一贯忠于革命的干部。他在“七七”事变后不久就参加了村政权工作。以后门东村变为游击根据地时，他仍然坚持抗日斗争，在一九四○年被群众选举为抗日村长，工作一贯积极负责。因在扩军和贯彻统一累进税中有良好成绩，曾得过全县模范奖旗。他在村中建立了小学和民校，切实执行了减租减息政策。一九四二年日寇进行“五一”大扫荡后，环境更加艰苦，他经组织委派任应敌村长。在长期的尖锐的对敌斗争中，他经常护送我方干部穿越封锁线，营救过抗日干部王醒凡、朱贵同和马乱山等多人脱险，并经常在村掩护我方党政负责干部。该村党政工作始终未遭破坏，他是有一定功绩的。他曾经奉组织委派和伪军李文焕联系过，但并不是“和伪大队长勾结，报告我军活动情况”。他也没有“领敌抓捕工人李小辈”，而是在李小辈被敌人抓去毒打时设法将李小辈保释出来。区干部王培山的被捕，也不是他上去将王抱住，而是敌特要他帮助追捕王培山，他急中生智，假装摔倒，应付过去了。郑义所称被活埋的马先生，现在查明是汉奸特务的狗腿，当地群众对他切齿痛恨，曾再三要求将他铲除；后经抗日政府同意，由郑洛权等协助区小组班长将他处死。郑义的哥哥郑生华之死，也查明根本和郑洛权无关。事实是：一九四七年冬门东村进行土地改革，郑义的家庭因剥削和虐待雇工，被评为富农成份（后来纠偏时改为富裕中农），郑生华、郑生禄与该村其他地主、富农同时被扣。郑生华在被扣期间精神失常，企图夺枪逃跑，和民兵发生冲突。适有两个过路的战士在附近住宿，听说是地主、富农夺枪，愤怒之下，便帮着民兵把郑生华打伤了。被告中当时只有郑吉苍、徐贯卿、郑洛帅在场，其余郑洛权等三人根本和此事无关。郑生华因伤势日重而死去以后，群众怕郑义报复，就由贫农团和新农会向工作组建议，把郑义从部队上要回，扣押在村中。后因罪嫌不大，送县扣押数日即让他仍回部队工作。但郑义却因此怀恨在心，必欲报复，回部队后就捏造事实，向县诬告郑洛权等。
    郑义所以要诬告郑洛权，还有其历史原因。抗战期间郑洛权任村长时，郑义家不按规定发给雇工半实物工资，被雇工控告，区里罚了他家土布数匹，当时郑洛权是站在雇工立场主张罚布的。有一次郑义家和人发生纠纷，郑洛权调解的结果不利于郑义家。还有一次因郑义家里闹纠纷，郑洛权在调解中抱不平，曾打过郑义和他母亲的耳光。早在一九四六年安国解放后，郑义就从上述私怨出发，以叛变通敌等罪名诬告过郑洛权。当时该县司法科未把事情调查清楚，便草率判处郑洛权五年徒刑。但郑义仍不满意，曾企图用铡刀杀害郑洛权。郑生华被打伤致死后，郑义便借机又一次诬告郑洛权。这一事实经过，充分说明了郑义的卑鄙恶毒，完全失掉了共产党员和革命军人应有的品质。
    最高人民检察署在查明以上情况后，立即向最高人民法院和华北分院提出意见，要求重审这一案件。河北省人民法院接到上级法院的指示，即于八月十一日在门东村召开群众大会，当众宣布撤消原判决，改判郑洛权等六人无罪释放。郑义因挟嫌诬告，被判处三年徒刑。河北省军区和军区党委并宣布开除郑义的军籍和党籍。郑洛权等因被诬告遭受损失，已由当地政府适当予以补助。当地群众一致拥护这一公正的处理。
