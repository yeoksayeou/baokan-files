Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 30th. Harrison, in order to prop up his "victor" pose, shamelessly boasted at the armistice talks on the 19th: "Under the attacks of our air and sea forces, you obviously have no effective defense." A day later, Admiral Briscoe, commander of the US Far East Naval Forces, gave this American general, who loves to lie and brag before God, a heavy slap in the face. Briscoe publicly admitted that it was "simply impossible" for the United States to use its air and sea forces to destroy North Korea's supply and transportation lines.

Long before Briscoe's public admission, the facts on the Korean battlefield had already proven the complete bankruptcy of the US's so-called "air and sea attacks." The US Air Force chiefs once dreamed of severing our army's supply lines. For a year, they carried out a "strangulation war" in an attempt to implement a comprehensive blockade, but even the heads of the "Fifth Air Force" had to publicly admit failure. The Associated Press once revealed: "The situation in the battle to attack the Communist supply lines and win air supremacy, as described by authoritative officials of the Fifth Air Force, is very treacherous." At the end of March, the American air bandits had to switch to a new so-called "key assault war." However, General Van Fleet, commander of the US Eighth Army invading Korea, said in frustration at the end of May: "Unfortunately, our air interception has not been enough to prevent the enemy from supplying his front areas." Van Fleet said he was "not blaming the air force" because "the air force has used its last strength." Therefore, the final result is that the US Air Force not only failed to realize its "strangulation war" and "assault war," but also lost a large number of aircraft and personnel. From June 26 last year to June 15 this year, our army's powerful anti-aircraft artillery units and the growing air force shot down and damaged a total of 5,922 enemy aircraft; in the entire month of June this year, 389 enemy aircraft were shot down and damaged; in July, 269 enemy aircraft were shot down and damaged. The "New York Times" reported on February 12 that David, the American "ace jet pilot" shot down by Zhang Jiuhui, a hero of our Volunteer Air Force, wrote to his wife shortly before his death: "We must think of a way... We have lost so many planes, so many people." This embarrassing situation is of course not seen in the "all safe return" battle reports habitually issued by the "Fifth Air Force," but it is fully reflected in the extreme depression of the US Air Force's morale. The "U.S. News & World Report" on April 25 revealed that since the Korean War, more and more US Air Force personnel have requested to be relieved of flight duties. Those who have not been approved simply defy orders and refuse to fly. A recent issue of the American magazine "Outlook" also revealed that last year at the Pensacola Airfield of the US Navy, 54% of the trainees were eliminated because they were "afraid of flying." For the first time, the US Military Academy at West Point also failed to have 25% of its graduates join the Air Force. Lieutenant Colonel Allen, a psychiatric consultant to the US Air Force Medical Corps, admitted that only those with mental illnesses are willing to go to Korea to die, and among the vast number of US Air Force personnel, the tendency to be "afraid of flying" is becoming "more and more serious."

The situation of the US Navy is naturally no better than that of the Air Force. In order to fight against tiny Korea, the US Navy has suffered huge losses. Even according to the materials announced by the US Navy itself, as of the end of April, the US warships sunk and damaged in the Korean War had already reached as many as 51. Eleven British warships were damaged. From then until now, this number has certainly increased greatly. In particular, some warships have been hit more than once. In August alone, the US has publicly admitted that an aircraft carrier, the "Boxer," was seriously damaged, and six other warships were hit. Briscoe himself was hit by shells from the Korean-Chinese side. In March this year, when he was still the commander of the US Seventh Fleet, his flagship, the "Wisconsin," was hit by the powerful coastal artillery of the Korean-Chinese side and finally had to retire. The battle reports now issued by the US Navy Headquarters have lost the arrogant tone of the past, and it has had to admit that the coastal artillery fire of the Korean-Chinese side has become "increasingly fierce" and "more accurate."

Under these circumstances, Briscoe openly admitted in a speech on the 20th that the US "air and sea attacks" not only failed to achieve any results, but were also a losing business. He said: "The problem of destroying all transportation lines and keeping them in a state of disrepair for a long time requires a certain effectiveness (in bombing), and it is probably not worth paying so much effort for this effectiveness." Therefore, he had to advocate that "another method should be adopted." The American "Christian Science Monitor" reported on August 21 that Briscoe's remarks raised a question that Tokyo's "observers" had long been "very interested" in, that is: "From a military point of view, are the gains from the air raids on North Korean cities and villages sufficient to prove that the huge cost in personnel and equipment paid in the air raids is worthwhile?" Regarding the role of the navy, some "observers" believe that: "Month after month, using battleships and cruisers to bombard the coast (which is very expensive), and launching expensive ammunition from ships, it seems that no favorable reward has been obtained in terms of the enemy's overall losses."

Facts have proved that the so-called "air and sea attacks" of the American aggressors have been completely bankrupted. The effect it has achieved, in addition to arousing greater hatred and anger from the Korean-Chinese people and the people of the world, is to cause the US air and sea forces to suffer huge losses and consumption; this loss and consumption has been so great that the American aggressors cannot bear it, which is why Briscoe came out to shout that "another method" should be adopted. It is truly naive and foolishly ridiculous that Harrison, who does not know the times, still wants to use "air and sea attacks" to scare people at such a time.

### 朝鲜战场上美国海空军巨大损失的事实证明  哈利逊所吹嘘的“海空攻击”早已彻底破产

    朝鲜战场上美国海空军巨大损失的事实证明
    哈利逊所吹嘘的“海空攻击”早已彻底破产
    【新华社开城三十日电】哈利逊为了支撑他的“胜利者”的架子，曾经在十九日的停战谈判会议上恬不知耻地吹嘘说：“在我方空中与海上的攻击下，你们显然没有有效的防御。”隔了一天，美国远东海军司令布里斯柯就给这位爱在上帝面前撒谎吹牛的美国将军狠狠地吃了一记耳光。布里斯柯公开承认说：美国要想用海空军来摧毁北朝鲜的供应和交通线“简直是办不到的事”。
    早在布里斯柯公开承认以前，朝鲜战场上的事实已经证明了美方所谓“海空攻击”的彻底破产。美国空军首脑曾经梦想过断绝我军的运输线。一年以来，他们长时期地进行了企图实行全面封锁的“绞杀战”，结果却连“第五航空队”的头子们也不得不公开承认失败。美联社就曾透露过：“第五航空队权威官员们所说的攻击共军供应线和争取制空权的战斗形势是很险恶的”。三月底，美国空中强盗们不得不改用新的所谓“重点突击战”。但是侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特五月底却懊恼地说：“不幸得很，我们的空军截击并未足以阻止敌人供应他的前方地区。”范佛里特说他“不是责难空军”，因为“空军已经使出了最后的气力”。因此，最后的结果是：美国空军不但不能实现它的“绞杀战”、“突击战”，反而丧失了大量的飞机和人员。从去年六月二十六日至今年六月十五日，我军强大的高射炮部队和日益壮大的空军，共击落、击伤敌机五千九百二十二架；今年六月全月，击落、击伤敌机三百八十九架；七月，击落、击伤敌机二百六十九架。“纽约时报”在二月十二日就曾报道过：被我志愿军空军英雄张积慧击落的美国“王牌喷气式驾驶员”戴维斯，在送命前不久曾给他的妻子写信说：“一定得想些办法……我们损失了这么多的飞机，这么多的人。”这种狼狈情况，在“第五航空队”惯于发布的“全部安全返防”的战报里，当然是看不到的，但是在美国空军士气的极度低落上却完全反映了出来。四月二十五日的“美国新闻与世界报道”透露，从朝鲜战争以来，美国空军人员请求解除飞行职务的越来越多。那些没有被批准的干脆就违抗命令，拒绝飞行。最近一期美国的“展望”杂志也透露：去年在美国海军的潘萨科拉飞机场，有百分之五十四的学员因为“害怕飞行”而被淘汰。美国的西点军校也第一次未能使它的百分之二十五的毕业生参加空军。美国空军军医署的精神病顾问阿仑中校承认，只有那些患精神病的人才愿意到朝鲜去送命，而在广大美国空军人员中间，“害怕飞行”的倾向正在“一天比一天厉害”。
    美国海军的情形自然不会比空军更好些。为了对小小的朝鲜作战，美国海军已经遭受了巨大的损失。即使根据美国海军自己宣布的材料，到四月下旬为止，美国在朝鲜战争中被击沉击伤的军舰也已经有五十一艘之多。英国军舰被击伤的有十一艘。从那时到现在，这个数字当然还要大大增加。特别是有的军舰被击中已经不止一次。仅仅在八月份，美方已经公开承认有一艘航空母舰“拳师号”受重伤，另外有六艘军舰被击中。布里斯柯自己就挨过朝中方面的炮弹。在今年三月间他还是美国第七舰队司令的时候，他所乘坐的旗舰“威斯康星号”曾经被朝中方面强大的海岸炮队击中，最后不得不退役。美国海军司令部现在发布的战报已经消失了从前那种不可一世的调子，它不得不承认，朝中方面的海岸炮火已经“日渐猛烈”，并且“更加准确”。
    在这种情况下，布里斯柯在二十日发表的谈话中，公开承认美方的“海空攻击”不但不能收到什么效果，而且是一种蚀本生意。他说：“摧毁所有交通线并使它们长期处在损毁状态中这一问题，需要（在轰炸时）有一定的效力，为了这种效力付出这么多的努力大概是不值得的。”因此他不得不主张应该“采取另一种办法”。美国的“基督教科学箴言报”在八月二十一日报道说，布里斯柯的谈话提起了东京的“观察家”早已“很感兴趣”的一个问题，这就是：“海空军对北朝鲜城乡进行空袭的收获，就其军事意义上看来，是否足以证明空袭中所付出的人员和配备方面的巨大代价是合算的？”对于海军的作用，有些“观察家”认为：“月复一月地用战斗舰和巡洋舰向海岸轰击（这是很花钱的），以及由舰只发射昂贵的弹药，就所造成的敌人的全盘损失而言，似乎没有获得有利的酬报。”
    事实证明：美国侵略者的所谓“海空攻击”已经彻底破产。它所达到的效果，除了是惹起朝中人民与全世界人民更大的仇恨和愤怒之外，就是使美国的海空军遭受了巨大的损失和消耗；这种损失和消耗已经大到美国侵略者受不了的程度，这就是布里斯柯出来叫喊要“采取另一种办法”的原故。不识时务的哈利逊在这样的时候还想拿“海空攻击”来吓唬人，真是幼稚而愚蠢得可笑。
