    Savings Certificates Should Not Be Used to Purchase Wheat
    Editor: In mid-June this year, when the Hefei branch of the China Grain Company was purchasing new wheat in Xiatangji, Shou County, Anhui Province, it remitted 30 million yuan in RMB from Hefei to the Xiatangji branch of the People's Bank. However, the Xiatangji branch did not have enough cash on hand and decided to use a large number of savings certificates to pay the grain company for the purchase of new wheat from farmers. The grain company initially disagreed, but the person in charge of the branch later said, "We'll handle the distribution for you." Thus, about 10 million yuan worth of savings certificates were put into circulation to purchase wheat in one morning. Farmers who received savings certificates for selling their wheat immediately went to the market to buy cloth, salt, and other daily necessities, and some even took them to the countryside. When farmers used savings certificates to buy things, private merchants took the opportunity to devalue the savings certificates, causing significant losses to the farmers and arousing dissatisfaction among those who sold their wheat. The Xiatangji branch's use of savings certificates instead of cash to inject money into the market was wrong, and the relevant cadres of the Hefei Grain Company should also bear some responsibility for failing to uphold principles. I suggest that the higher-level bank of the Xiatangji branch investigate this matter and prevent similar errors from occurring again.

### 不应该用储蓄券收购小麦

    不应该用储蓄券收购小麦
    编辑同志：今年六月中旬，中国粮食公司合肥门市部在安徽寿县下塘集收购新麦时，由合肥票汇了三千万元人民币到人民银行下塘集营业所，但下塘集营业所没有准备现款，而决定以大批储蓄券代替现款给粮食公司去收购农民的新麦。当时粮食公司不同意这样作，后来该营业所负责人说：“我们给你们去发”。就这样在一个上午的时间，投放了一千万元左右的储蓄券去收购小麦。农民拿着卖麦子的储蓄券马上到市场上去买布、盐等日用品，有的还带到乡下去了。农民拿储蓄券买东西的时候，私商便乘机贬低储蓄券的价格，使农民吃亏很大，引起了售麦农民的不满。下塘集营业所以储蓄券代替现款向市场投放是不对的，合肥粮食公司有关干部不能坚持原则，也应负一定责任。我建议下塘集营业所的上级银行对这件事情进行检查，并防止再发生类似错误。姜明东
