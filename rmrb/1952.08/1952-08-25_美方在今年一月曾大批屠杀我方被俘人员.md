Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker," reported from a location in Korea on the 22nd: The largest massacre of prisoners of war occurred on Geoje Island in January of this year, when 170 prisoners of war were killed. The U.S. side has never reported this incident. After speaking with special agents recently airdropped here, the facts have become clear. Peng Renshan (transliteration), a former prisoner of war from the U.S. 72nd camp, who was airdropped here on April 11th, gave the most detailed account. His report has been confirmed by other witnesses. He said that in January of this year, the U.S. side wanted to "screen" the prisoners of war in the nearby 61st camp, which was entirely composed of Korean People's Army personnel. They resisted the "screening." They wrote slogans on paper banners, demanding to be sent home, and sang the popular "Kim Il-sung Song." U.S. troops and Syngman Rhee's troops arrived in armored vehicles and opened fire on the camp, strafing for half an hour. The prisoners of war in the 72nd camp heard the gunfire and singing, but they could not approach the edge of the camp. Later, work teams from the 72nd camp were sent to bury the bodies of the dead. About 170 prisoners of war were killed, but the number of wounded is unknown, as they had been moved away before that. Peng Renshan said that the ground was soaked with blood. The first known major massacre was the one on February 18th. The U.S. side, with the assistance of their friends at the Swiss Red Cross, suppressed the news for five days. They colluded to suppress the news of the January massacre until today. Peng Renshan's number on Geoje Island was 711417.

    美方在今年一月曾大批屠杀我方被俘人员
    【新华社二十四日讯】伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿二十二日自朝鲜某地报道：本年一月在巨济岛发生过最大一次屠杀战俘的事件，当时有战俘一百七十人被杀。美方从未报告过这件事。在我与最近在此间空投下来的特务们谈话后，已经弄清楚了事实。四月十一日在此间空投下来的前美方第七十二号营场的战俘彭仁山（译音），作了最详明的叙述。他的报告业经其他见证人证实。他说，在本年一月，美方想要“甄别”附近第六十一号营场的战俘，这个营场的战俘全是朝鲜人民军人员。他们抗拒“甄别”。他们在纸制的标语上写上口号，要求遣送他们回家，并歌唱流行的“金日成之歌”。美军和李承晚军乘装甲车开来，向营场开枪，扫射了半小时。第七十二号营场的战俘听到了枪声和唱歌声，但他们不能靠近营场的边缘。后来第七十二号营场的工作队被派出掩埋死者的尸体。被杀的战俘约有一百七十人，但不知道受伤的有多少，因为他们在这以前被运走了。彭仁山说，地上浸透了鲜血。外界所知道第一次的大屠杀是二月十八日的那一次屠杀，美方在他们的朋友瑞士红十字会的协助下把这个消息扣压了五天。他们串通一起把本年一月的这次屠杀消息一直扣压到今天。彭仁山在巨济岛的编号是七一一四一七。
