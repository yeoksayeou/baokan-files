    Why Did an Explosion Occur at the Tap Hole of a Blast Furnace at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant?

    To the Editor: A certain blast furnace in the Iron Smelting Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant experienced numerous accidents from early 1950 to February 1952. Among them, eight major scaffold accidents and one tap hole explosion accident resulted in a production loss of 11.53% of the total output. Consequently, the department failed to fulfill the production tasks assigned by the state in 1950 and 1951.

    The main reason for these accidents was that the technical personnel in the department did not value the opinions of Soviet experts and did not accept the suggestions of the workers. The tap hole explosion accident on November 16, 1951, is a typical example.

    Prior to this accident in the department, a similar accident had already occurred at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. The Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central People's Government Heavy Industry Department had issued instructions, introducing the opinions of Soviet experts, urging relevant factories and mines to pay attention to preventing such accidents. However, Zhao Kechun, the head of the department, did not take this instruction and the opinions of Soviet experts seriously. He only asked the technical personnel to circulate these documents, without discussing them with the workers, and then locked the documents away. Subsequently, the Soviet experts who arrived at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant thoroughly inspected the tap hole conditions of the blast furnace and put forward many suggestions, but they did not attract the attention of the relevant technical personnel. For example, the experts discovered that the tap hole was only 500 to 600 mm deep and immediately pointed out that the tap hole should maintain a depth of more than 1.2 meters, otherwise, there would be danger. Zhao Kechun still did not value these opinions. Four days before the accident, workers saw that the tap hole was only 400 to 500 mm deep and suggested to Zhao Kechun to improve the depth of the tap hole by plugging mud and driving taphole bars, but he ignored them. At the time of the accident, the tap hole was only 400 mm deep; at that time, it was hastily plugged with mud and some refractory bricks. Due to the inadequate protection of the tap hole, the molten iron corroded the refractory bricks of the tap hole, eroded the iron plate of the hearth, and melted the cold water tank and return water pipe. When the molten iron encountered cold water, an explosion occurred.

    The above is the direct cause of the tap hole explosion. However, the fundamental reason is that the Iron Smelting Department has consistently used a conservative empirical method in batching operations, namely the backward "high slag ratio" operation method. This method was copied from Japanese technical books. In May last year, Soviet experts discovered the above situation and put forward more than 20 suggestions. All these opinions were ignored by Zhao Kechun, thus causing the major accident of the tap hole explosion.

    In March and April of this year, the technical personnel of the Iron Smelting Department initially criticized the backward technical thinking and implemented the suggestions of the Soviet experts. Production exceeded the quota every month, and accidents almost disappeared.

    From the above facts, it can be seen that Zhao Kechun still has rather serious conservative views and empirical thinking. Take batching operations as an example: Soviet experts once clearly pointed out: "The most important work in blast furnace operation is batching. The batching worker is the cook of the furnace. Only when the cook makes good food can the blast furnace digest it easily." The Soviet experts, in light of the specific situation of the plant at that time, put forward suggestions such as improving raw material management, identifying raw material types, paying attention to uniform composition, and reducing the slag ratio. However, the technical personnel, led by Zhao Kechun, stubbornly adhered to their backward batching operation methods and refused to accept advanced Soviet experience. Secondly, it can also be seen from this incident that Zhao Kechun also held the bourgeois viewpoint of looking down on the working class. The liberated working class is the master of the state enterprise and the operator of the machines. Therefore, in production, it is necessary to rely on the working class; however, after the higher authorities issued instructions to prevent tap hole explosion accidents, Zhao Kechun never thought of conveying them to the workers, so as to mobilize the workers and rely on the workers to prevent accidents; even when the workers actively put forward suggestions to improve the depth of the tap hole, he ignored them. Therefore, his technical guidance was divorced from reality. He adopted the "high slag ratio" operation method, neither discussing it with the workers nor carefully observing the changes in the furnace conditions, changing the material line four or five times a day, resulting in raw materials often not descending smoothly. This series of facts shows that technical personnel must criticize and eliminate the backward conservative thinking of capitalism in order to accept the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; they must fully develop and rely on the wisdom of the broad masses of workers and staff so that the knowledge of technical personnel and the practical experience of workers can be combined to better participate in the construction of the motherland.

### 太原钢铁厂某高炉为什么发生出铁口爆炸事故

    太原钢铁厂某高炉为什么发生出铁口爆炸事故
    编辑同志：太原钢铁厂炼铁部某高炉从一九五○年初到一九五二年二月发生了许多事故。其中八次较大的棚炉事故和一次出铁口爆炸事故，就使生产量损失了总产量的百分之十一点五三。因此，该部在一九五○年和一九五一年没有完成国家所给予的生产任务。
    发生这些事故的主要原因是该部的技术人员不重视苏联专家的意见，不接受工人的建议。一九五一年十一月十六日高炉出铁口爆炸事故，就是一个典型的例子。
    该部发生这次事故以前，石景山钢铁厂已经发生过类似的事故。中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业局曾发出指示，并且介绍了苏联专家的意见，要各有关厂矿注意预防这种事故。但该部主任赵克春并没有重视这个指示和苏联专家的意见。他只叫技术人员轮流传阅了这些文件，根本没有和工人研究，就把文件锁起来了。此后，到达太原钢铁厂的苏联专家，曾详细地检查了高炉出铁口的情况，提出了许多建议，但未引起有关技术人员的注意。例如，专家发现高炉出铁口仅五百至六百米厘深，立即指出：高炉的出铁口应保持一点二米以上深度，否则有危险。赵克春还不重视这些意见。在事故发生前四天，工人看到出铁口只有四百至五百米厘深，向赵克春提出堵泥、打钎等改进出铁口深度的建议，他还是置之不理。发生事故的时候，出铁口只有四百米厘；当时是用泥和了一些耐火砖块仓促堵上的。由于出铁口保护不周，铁水蚀掉了出铁口的耐火砖，蚀化了炉缸的铁板，又融化了冷水箱和退水管，当铁水与冷水相遇，就发生爆炸了。
    以上是造成出铁口爆炸的直接原因。但根本的原因是炼铁部在配料操作方面一直沿用着保守的经验主义的方法，即落后的“高渣比”操作法。这种方法是从日本的技术书本上抄下来的。去年五月，苏联专家发现了上述的情况，曾提出了二十几条建议。这些意见都被赵克春置诸脑后，因此发生了出铁口爆炸的重大事故。
    今年三、四月间，炼铁部的技术人员初步批判了落后的技术思想，贯彻了苏联专家的建议，生产月月超额完成，事故几乎绝迹。
    从以上事实可以看出赵克春还有相当严重的保守观点和经验主义思想。就以配料操作来说吧：苏联专家曾经明白地指出：“高炉操作中最主要的工作是配料。配料工作者是锅炉的厨子，厨子作出好饭，高炉吃了才易消化。”苏联专家针对当时该厂的具体情况，提出了改善原料管理、识别原料种类、注意成份均匀及降低渣比等建议。但是，以赵克春为首的技术人员却固执着自己的落后的配料操作方法，拒绝接受苏联先进经验。其次，从这件事情也可以看出，赵克春还存在着资产阶级的轻视工人阶级的观点。解放了的工人阶级是国家企业的主人，是机器的操纵者，因此在生产中要依靠工人阶级；但是赵克春在上级发下预防出铁口爆炸事故的指示后，完全没有想到要向工人传达，以便发动工人和依靠工人来防止事故；甚至工人主动地提出了改进出铁口深度的建议，他还置之不理。因此，他的技术指导是脱离实际的。他采取了“高渣比”操作法，既不和工人商量，又不仔细观察炉子的变化情况，一天变四五次料线，结果原料常常下不痛快。这一系列的事实说明，技术人员必须批判和清除资本主义的落后的保守思想，以便接受苏联的先进经验；必须充分发挥并依靠广大职工的智慧，以便使技术人员的知识和工人的实际经验结合起来，更好地来参加祖国的建设。
