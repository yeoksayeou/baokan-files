    To the Editor: Since May of this year, the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau has been experiencing constant accidents and injuries, greatly hindering the progress of the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement.
    The types of accidents include locomotive journal burn-offs, vehicle collisions, brake seizures, incorrect signal reporting, poor cargo loading, and broken rails.
    The reasons for the accidents are that after the "Three-Anti" movement, Party committees at all levels were busy with Party rectification and building, the trade union was busy with organizational re-elections, and the administration was busy with the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement. Nobody paid attention to safety in production. In addition, technical equipment was incomplete, workers did not comply with labor discipline, and did not abide by rules and regulations, and no one was in charge. This led to continuous accidents.
    The accidents that occurred in the sub-bureau have caused more than ten billion yuan in losses to state property. This is extremely distressing. I suggest that the leading cadres of the Party committee, administration, and trade union of the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau immediately take effective measures and formulate a set of strict working systems to eliminate accidents and injuries, and ensure the victorious advance of the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement.

    南昌铁路分局应克服伤亡事故
    编辑同志：南昌铁路分局自今年五月以来，不断发生伤亡事故，大大妨碍了满载、超轴、五百公里运动的进展。
    事故的种类，有机车烧轴、车辆冲突、抱闸、误报信号、货物装载不良、钢轨断轨等。
    造成事故的原因，是“三反”运动后，各级党委忙于整党建党，工会忙于改选组织，行政忙于满载、超轴、五百公里运动，都没注意安全生产，加之技术设备不齐全，工人不遵守劳动纪律，不遵守规章制度等，也没有人管。这就使事故不断发生。
    该分局所发生的事故，使国家财产损失十多亿元。这是非常令人痛心的。我建议南昌铁路分局的党委、行政、工会的领导干部立即采取有效措施，制定一套严密的工作制度，以消灭伤亡事故，保证满载、超轴、五百公里运动胜利前进。南昌铁路分局监察分室小房
