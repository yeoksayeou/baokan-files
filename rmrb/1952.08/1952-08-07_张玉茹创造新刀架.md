    Zhang Yuru Creates New Tool Holder
    Editor: Zhang Yuru, a worker in the planer group of the Beijing Machine Factory's heavy machinery workshop, has successfully created a small tool holder that can hold three tools and adjust them arbitrarily. This has increased work efficiency by two and a half times and solved a major shortage of planer machines in the factory.
    In promoting the multi-tool and multi-edge cutting method, Zhang Yuru first used two tools on a planer to plane the surface of the bullhead planer workbench, increasing production by two times. This broke the conservative idea that multi-tool and multi-edge cutting could not be used on large planers, and motivated everyone to use the multi-tool and multi-edge cutting method. Building on this foundation, he came up with a small tool holder that can hold three tools. This tool uses a fixed tool in the middle as a standard, and the two tools on either side can be arbitrarily aligned to find the distance. It can be used not only when planing workbenches, but also for any workpiece processed on a planer (such as screw slots). Zheng Wenyou

    张玉茹创造新刀架
    编辑同志：北京机器厂重机房龙门刨组工人张玉茹，创造了能装三把刀并任意对刀的小刀架成功，提高工作效率二倍半，解决了该厂龙门刨床不足的重大困难。
    在推广多刀多刃切削法当中，张玉茹曾首先在龙门刨上使用了二把刀来刨牛头刨工作台的平面，把生产提高了二倍，打破了认为在大刨车上不能用多刀多刃切削的保守思想，并带动大家运用多刀多刃切削法。在这个基础上，他想出了一个能装三把刀的小刀架子。这个工具是用中间一把固定刀作标准，两侧两把刀可以任意对刀，找距离。不仅在刨工作台时能用，凡在龙门刨床上加工的工作物（如螺丝槽等）都可使用。郑文友
