Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 10th: A special correspondent from this agency reports: All clauses regarding various agendas in the draft armistice agreement have been agreed upon, but the armistice agreement still cannot be signed because the U.S. negotiating representatives refuse to implement the agreed-upon provisions regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war. This is the unreasonable situation in the Panmunjom meeting tent as the armistice negotiations reach their thirteenth-month mark today. The formal delegations of both sides will hold a meeting tomorrow, at which time it will be known whether Harrison will once again flee Panmunjom.

The current deadlock in the armistice negotiations has become another milestone in the U.S.'s lack of sincerity. They deliberately dragged out the negotiation of the armistice terms for thirteen months, and then refused to abide by those terms. The whole world is now watching an absurd situation: both sides have reached agreement on all armistice terms, but the U.S. representative refuses to take a step forward and cross the threshold they have set of detaining our captured personnel to realize the armistice in Korea. They are making this situation doubly impossible to resolve, forcing the meeting to adjourn for three days at a time on several occasions, now adjourning for a week, and then possibly adjourning indefinitely.

The last but serious obstacle to the Korean armistice is the U.S. refusal to re-examine the prisoner-of-war roster and exchange prisoners of war in accordance with the agreed-upon Articles 51 and 52 of the draft armistice agreement regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war. The Korean and Chinese representatives are prepared to abide by all the terms of the armistice agreement. They are prepared to repatriate all prisoners of war they hold, and have stated that they will repatriate approximately 12,000 prisoners of war, a number exceeding the number on our side’s prisoner of war roster exchanged on December 18th of last year. The U.S. representative, however, refuses to repatriate 20 percent of Korean prisoners of war whose homes are in North Korea and 68 percent of Chinese prisoners of war.

It is now very clear that the U.S. representative agreed to Article 51 in order to effectively nullify it. They have a perfidious conspiracy in their hearts: they want to unilaterally handle these prisoners of war so that they will not be returned when the armistice agreement takes effect. In order to deceive public opinion, Harrison said that 38,000 Korean prisoners of war would be "directly released," but Harrison is fully aware that these 38,000 people will be handed over to Syngman Rhee, and tens of thousands of them will never be able to return home because their homes are in North Korea. As for the more than 13,000 Chinese prisoners of war, Harrison is silent, because he cannot tell everyone that these people will be handed over to their enemy—Chiang Kai-shek of Taiwan.

The U.S. refusal to abide by agreed-upon principles is the result of Washington's "drag on" policy in Korea for the past thirteen months. As long as the U.S. representative abides by the agreed-upon clauses in the draft armistice agreement, the armistice agreement can be signed, and all prisoners of war can return home to enjoy peaceful lives. But Washington maintains a cold and ruthless indifference even towards its own prisoners of war, because they want to "drag on."

If the result of the negotiations is failure, then the world is already very clear about who bears the ultimate responsibility. The indisputable fact is that the representative of the United States government is unwilling to sign the armistice agreement they have already agreed to. These executioners who slaughtered Korean women and children and Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are unwilling to achieve an armistice in Korea; they want to continue and expand the Korean War to threaten peace in the Far East and the world.

### 美方拒绝实施已获协议的遣俘规定阻碍朝鲜停战协定迟迟不能签字

    美方拒绝实施已获协议的遣俘规定阻碍朝鲜停战协定迟迟不能签字
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者报道：停战协定草案中关于各项议程的一切条款都已取得协议，但是停战协定还是不能够签字，原因是美方谈判代表拒绝实施已获协议的关于遣返战俘的各项规定。这是在停战谈判今天满了十三个月的时候板门店会议帐篷中的不合理局面。双方正式代表团将于明日举行会议，到时候就可以知道哈利逊是不是又要逃离板门店。
    停战谈判现在的僵局成了美方没有诚意的又一个里程碑。他们故意把停战条款的谈判拖了十三个月，然后又拒绝遵守这些条款。全世界现在都眼看着一种不合常理的情况：在所有的停战条款上双方都已取得了协议，但是美方代表却拒绝前进一步跨过他们所设的扣留我方被俘人员的门槛来实现朝鲜的停战。他们还在使这种局面加倍地无法打开，强使会议曾一连好几次休会三天，现在是休会一个星期，再就可能是无限期的休会。
    朝鲜停战的最后一个但却是严重的一个障碍，是美方拒绝重新校正战俘名册并依照已获协议的关于遣返战俘的停战协定草案第五十一款与五十二款交换战俘。朝中代表是准备遵守停战协定的一切条款的。他们准备遣返他们所拘留的全部战俘，并且已声明他们将遣返一万二千名左右的战俘，这个数字超过了去年十二月十八日交换的我方战俘名册上的人数。而美方代表却拒绝遣返百分之二十家在北朝鲜的朝鲜战俘和百分之六十八的中国战俘。
    现在已经很清楚，美方代表之所以同意第五十一款，为的是在实际上取消它。他们在骨子里有一个背信弃义的阴谋：他们要单方面地处理这些战俘，以便到停战协定生效的时候不将他们归还。为了欺骗舆论，哈利逊说三万八千朝鲜战俘要“直接释放”，但是哈利逊完全清楚这三万八千人是要交给李承晚的，他们中间有成千上万的人会永远回不了家，因为他们的家是在北朝鲜。至于那一万三千多中国战俘，哈利逊就一言不发，因为他不能告诉大家说这些人将被交给他们的敌人——台湾的蒋介石。
    美方拒绝遵守已获协议的原则，是十三个月来华盛顿在朝鲜实行“拖下去”政策的结果。只要美方代表遵守停战协定草案中已获协议的条款，停战协定就可以签字，全体战俘就可以回家安享和平生活。但是华盛顿甚至对于它自己的战俘也抱着一种冷酷无情的漠不关心态度，因为他们想“拖下去”。
    如果谈判的结果是失败，那末最后责任属谁，全世界已经很清楚。无可置辩的事实是：美国政府的代表不愿在他们已经同意了的停战协定上签字。这些屠杀朝鲜的妇女儿童和朝中战俘的刽子手不愿在朝鲜实现停战，他们想要继续并扩大朝鲜战争，以威胁远东和世界的和平。
