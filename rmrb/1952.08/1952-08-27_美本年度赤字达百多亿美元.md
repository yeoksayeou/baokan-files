    Xinhua News Agency, Washington: As a result of the US government's pursuit of war policies, the national revenue and expenditure are imbalanced, and the fiscal budget is showing an increasingly large deficit.
    According to President Truman's estimate on August 19th, although the US Congress, in view of the fact that the US economy is unable to bear the burden, has greatly reduced the budget appropriations for the 1952-1953 fiscal year, the deficit will still be as high as 10.3 billion US dollars by the end of June next year. This figure will be more than one and a half times the deficit of 4 billion US dollars in the previous fiscal year.

    美本年度赤字达百多亿美元
    【新华社讯】华盛顿消息：美国政府推行战争政策的结果，国家收支不平衡，财政预算呈现愈来愈庞大的赤字。
    根据美国总统杜鲁门八月十九日的估计，虽然美国国会鉴于美国经济已不胜其负担而大量削减了一九五二—一九五三会计年度的预算拨款，但是到明年六月底为止的本会计年度中，赤字仍将高达一百零三亿美元。这个数字将比上一会计年度的四十亿美元的赤字增加一倍半以上。
