Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th: While sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations by means of a prolonged recess, the U.S. Fifth Air Force Command in Korea brazenly announced on the 5th that it would carry out barbaric bombing of seventy-eight peaceful cities in northern Korea. This action by the U.S. side declares to the world that the U.S. has no interest in the armistice negotiations that are of concern to people of all countries, but is keen to continue the war of aggression against Korea and carry out an unprecedented and insane massacre of peaceful Korean residents.

The U.S. aggressors' bloody plan, which disregards international law and humanitarian principles, has immediately aroused the righteous indignation of the people of the world. The U.S. military authorities could not help but feel uneasy about this consequence. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 6th, a U.S. Air Force spokesman admitted that "he was disturbed by the message he received from the United States." Therefore, U.S. Air Force Secretary Finletter and Far East Air Force Commander Weyland had to rush to cover up, trying to portray this heinous plan of massacring civilians, destroying peaceful cities, and violating the Geneva Convention as "destroying military targets," vainly attempting to deceive world opinion and escape the just condemnation of the people of all countries. However, the facts prove that the U.S. claim of "destroying military targets" is completely false. The seventy-eight cities announced by the U.S. as bombing targets actually include all areas of northern Korea. At the same time, people remember that the U.S. Air Force also claimed that the bombing of the outskirts of Pyongyang on August 4th was a bombing of "important military headquarters and troop concentration areas." However, everyone knows that there are no military targets in the outskirts of Pyongyang, only residential areas of peaceful people. In the bombing on August 4th, according to incomplete statistics, more than two hundred farmers' houses in the suburbs of Pyongyang were destroyed, and hundreds of residents were killed or injured, most of whom were women and children. Low-flying American pilots heartlessly fired rockets and machine guns at civilians drying clothes on mountainsides and embankments, cooking in open-air kitchens, and bathing young children, dropping countless bombs and napalm bombs. Therefore, the U.S. so-called "bombing of military targets" is nothing more than inhumanely destroying peaceful cities and massacring peaceful people.

After announcing its plan to carry out this barbaric bombing, the U.S. aggressors also spread the argument that so-called "military pressure" could force our side to accept its unreasonable plan. However, the U.S. so-called "military pressure" has repeatedly failed, and even the U.S. aggressors themselves know that the so-called "military pressure" cannot shake our firm stance in the slightest. Therefore, the so-called "military pressure" is actually a manifestation of the U.S. attempt to sabotage the armistice negotiations and expand the Korean War. This is confirmed by a series of crazy provocative and adventurous acts by the U.S. recently. From Harrison's long-term absence to the U.S. side's sabotage of the neutral zone agreement, shelling of the neutral zone, and U.S. aircraft intruding into the neutral zone in broad daylight; from the U.S. constantly dispatching agents through the neutral zone to sneak into the areas of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies to collect military intelligence, to the recent increase in air force to the Far East; from the U.S. bombing of the Yalu River power plant to their constant violation of China's Northeast airspace, indiscriminate bombing of Pyongyang, and announcement of large-scale bombing of seventy-eight cities in northern Korea, all of this clearly shows that the above assertion is correct.

Observers here pointed out that this crazy and barbaric bombing plan of the U.S. aggressors will not only fail to get them anything they cannot get at the negotiating table, but will inevitably arouse greater anger and stronger opposition and condemnation from the people of the world. The Hitler-like atrocities of the U.S. imperialists aimed at destroying the people will only make them more isolated and only prove more that they are the enemies of all mankind.

### 美方蓄意破坏谈判继续侵朝战争  竟扬言将对朝鲜北部七十八个城市滥施轰炸

    美方蓄意破坏谈判继续侵朝战争
    竟扬言将对朝鲜北部七十八个城市滥施轰炸
    【新华社开城九日电】和美方以长期休会的方式来破坏朝鲜停战谈判的同时，侵朝美军第五航空队司令部在五日扬言，要对朝鲜北部七十八个和平城市进行野蛮的轰炸。美方的这个行动向全世界宣布了美方对于为各国人民所关心的停战谈判毫无兴趣，而热中于继续侵朝战争，对朝鲜和平居民进行史无前例的疯狂的大屠杀。
    在美国侵略者这个蔑视国际法和人道原则的血腥计划宣布以后，立即激起了全世界人民的义愤。这一后果不能不使美国军事当局感到不安。据美联社东京六日电透露：美国空军发言人承认，“他从美国接到的消息使他感到不安”，因此，美国空军部长芬立脱和远东空军司令威兰不得不急忙出来掩饰，力图把这一屠杀平民、破坏和平城市、违反日内瓦公约的罪恶计划，说成是“摧毁军事目标”，妄想借此蒙蔽世界舆论，逃脱各国人民的正义的谴责。然而，事实证明，美方的所谓，“摧毁军事目标”的说法完全是谎话。被美方宣布为轰炸目标的七十八个城市，实际上已包括了朝鲜北部所有地区。同时，人们记得，美国空军把八月四日对平壤四郊的轰炸，也说成是“对重要的军事总部和军队集中区”的轰炸，但是，大家知道，在平壤四郊毫无军事目标，而只有和平人民的居住区。在八月四日的轰炸中，据不完全的统计，平壤郊区有二百多所农民房舍被毁，居民死伤数百人，其中大部分是妇女儿童。低飞的美国驾驶员对在山上堤岸上晒衣服、在露天厨房做饭、替小孩子洗澡的平民，狠心地发射火箭炮、机关枪，投下无数炸弹和凝固汽油弹。因此，美国的所谓“轰炸军事目标”，只是惨无人道地摧毁和平城市与屠杀和平人民。
    美国侵略者在宣布要实行这种野蛮轰炸的计划之后，又大事散布所谓“军事压力”可以迫使我方接受其无理方案的论调。可是，美方的所谓“军事压力”已经一再破产，甚至美国侵略者自己也深知所谓“军事压力”绝不能丝毫动摇我方的坚定立场。因此，所谓“军事压力”，其实是美方企图破坏停战谈判和扩大朝鲜战争的一种表现。这从美方最近一连串疯狂挑衅的冒险行为得到证实。从哈利逊实行长期逃会，到美方破坏中立区协议，炮轰中立区，美机在光天化日之下侵入中立区；从美方不断派遣特务经过中立区潜入朝中人民军队区域内搜集军事情报，到最近增派空军至远东；从美机轰炸鸭绿江发电厂到他们不断侵犯中国东北领空，滥炸平壤并宣布要大规模轰炸朝鲜北部七十八个城市，所有这一切，清楚地说明了上述论断是正确的。
    此间观察家指出：美国侵略者这一疯狂野蛮的轰炸计划，不但不能使他们取得任何在谈判桌上所不能得到的东西，而且必然将惹起全世界人民更大的愤怒和更加坚强的反对与斥责。美帝国主义者的希特勒式的旨在毁灭人民的暴行只有使他们更加孤立，只有更加证明他们是全人类的敌人。
