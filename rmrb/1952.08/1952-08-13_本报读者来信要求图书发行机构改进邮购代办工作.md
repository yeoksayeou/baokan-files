Readers' Letters to This Newspaper Call for Improvements in Mail Order Services by Book Distribution Organizations

Many book distribution organizations have been providing mail order services, which has made it much more convenient for readers to buy books. However, due to the irresponsibility of some distribution staff, there are still many shortcomings in the mail order services. We are now publishing excerpts from readers' letters regarding this issue, hoping that relevant units will rectify these shortcomings.

Reader Zhang Yan from Southern Jiangsu wrote that their Communist Youth League group requested the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore to purchase six copies of "A Short History of Modern China" for studying modern Chinese history. More than a month passed, and they still hadn't received the books. They wrote to inquire. The Xinhua Bookstore replied that the order was being processed and told them not to worry. At that time, a comrade working in Beijing bought a copy of "A Short History of Modern China" for Zhang Yan, but the books ordered by mail still hadn't arrived. Later, the Xinhua Bookstore wrote back saying that the book was unavailable.

The Propaganda Department of the CCP Zhaohua County Committee in Northern Sichuan wrote that they remitted 6 million yuan last August to the Xidan branch of the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore to purchase books. The store delayed for three or four months before sending a portion of the books. A balance of more than 1.2 million yuan remained with the store. They wrote again, requesting the store to use the remaining funds to purchase books on cadre theoretical studies and ideological cultivation, but as of early June this year, the store still hadn't sent the books.

The Northwest Institute of Arts Library wrote that they ordered a set of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" from the Beijing International Bookstore by mail. On March 30th, the store sent two volumes, but both were Volume 6. They immediately returned one of the volumes along with the invoice to the store, requesting an exchange. But there was no news. After repeated inquiries, the store replied on May 3rd, saying "Returned book received." By the end of May, they had sent six letters of inquiry, but the store consistently ignored them.

The Correspondence Group of the Henan Provincial Lingbao Normal School wrote: The mail order work of the Beijing China Book Distribution Company is extremely chaotic. The school library owed the company more than 400,000 yuan in book fees this April, but the company wrote back saying that they only owed more than 100,000 yuan. The library remitted the correct amount, but the company wrote back again saying that there was still a balance of more than 60,000 yuan. Comrade Meng Guangchao from the school ordered "People's Songs" from the company by mail. The company replied saying: The money has been received, but there are no books. Later, the books were sent, but the company then wrote to Meng Guangchao, saying that the store did not have "People's Songs" and had not received the money sent. In April of this year, the school's students collectively ordered a batch of "Basic Knowledge of Social Science" from the company by mail. The company sent seventy-two copies less than ordered. The school sent two express letters of inquiry, but after more than a month, there was still no reply.

All readers suggest that relevant book distribution organizations seriously examine their work, correct the irresponsible work style of some distribution staff, and strengthen the inspection system for mail order distribution work, so as to better carry out mail order services.

专栏：读者来信综述

    本报读者来信要求图书发行机构改进邮购代办工作
    很多图书发行机构都办理了图书邮购代办业务，使广大读者购买书籍时便利多了。但是，由于某些发行人员对工作不负责任，邮购代办业务还存在着不少的缺点。现在我们把有关这个问题的读者来信摘要发表于后，希望有关单位纠正这些缺点。
    苏南读者张燕来信说，他们青年团小组为了学习中国近代史，请北京新华书店代购六本“中国近代史”。过了一个多月，还没有收到书。他们就写信催问。新华书店来信说，已在代办中，叫他们别着急。当时一个在北京工作的同志，替张燕买了一本
    “中国近代史”，但邮购的书还是没有寄来。后来，新华书店来信说：买不到这本书。
    中共川北昭化县委宣传部来信说，他们在去年八月汇款六百万元，请北京新华书店西单分店购买书籍。该店拖延了三、四个月，才寄来一部分书籍，余款一百二十多万元尚存该店。他们又去信请该店以余款购买有关干部理论学习和思想修养方面的书籍，但直到今年六月上旬，该店仍未把书寄去。
    西北艺术学院图书馆来信说，他们向北京国际书店邮购了一套苏联大百科全书。三月三十日，该店寄去了两册，但都是第六册。他们立刻把其中的一册连同发票退回该店，要求掉换。但一直没有消息。经再三催询，该店在五月三日复了一封信，说是“退书收到”。到五月底，他们已去信催了六次，该店总是置之不理。
    河南省立灵宝师范学校通讯组来信说：北京中国图书发行公司邮购工作极其混乱。该校图书馆今年四月份欠该公司书款四十多万元，该公司来信却说只欠十多万元。图书馆按正确数字把钱寄去，该公司又来信说尚存六万多元。该校孟广超同学向该公司邮购“人民歌声”，该公司回信说：钱已收到，但没有书。后来书已寄来了，该公司却又给孟广超来信，说是该店没有“人民歌声”，也没收到寄去的钱。该校同学在今年四月间集体向该公司邮购一批“社会科学基本知识”。该公司少寄了七十二册，学校连发两次快信催询，经过一个多月，还是没有答复。
    所有读者都建议各有关图书发行机构认真检查工作，纠正某些发行工作人员的不负责任的作风，加强邮购发行工作的检查制度，以便更好地开展邮购代办业务。
