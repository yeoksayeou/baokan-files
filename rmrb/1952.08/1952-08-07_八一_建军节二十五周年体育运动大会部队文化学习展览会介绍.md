    Introduction to the "August 1st" Army Day 25th Anniversary Sports Meet Troop Cultural Learning Exhibition

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army's "August 1st" Army Day 25th Anniversary Sports Meet Troop Cultural Learning Exhibition opened on August 1st at the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests in the Temple of Heaven, Beijing.

    This cultural learning exhibition showcases the cultural learning achievements of major military regions, field armies, and public security forces across the country. The exhibition is rich in content, including cultural education plans, overviews of cultural education, achievement statistics, teaching experiences, introductions to model figures and typical materials, teaching aids and models newly created by commanders and fighters, cultural teaching books and periodicals, introductions to troop cultural literacy schools, the "Establish Merits and Create Models" campaign, and the new atmosphere after the large-scale cultural learning activities launched by the troops, etc. The exhibition includes an introduction (including photos, pictures, and physical objects) to the Qi Jianhua "Rapid Literacy Method" which has been promoted nationwide, Cao Weimin's "Rapid Arithmetic Teaching Method" and experience introduction (including comic strips, models, and documents), Zeng Duanyi's new writing method introduction (comic strips), the original manuscript of the 200,000-word autobiographical novel by the nationally renowned hero and literary soldier Gao Yubao, the learning model deeds of the national combat heroes Wang Yougen, Li Wanyu, Liu Sihu, Cai E, who will forever maintain their glorious titles, and the model deeds of Chen Shufu, political commissar of the nationally famous "Tashan Hero Regiment," leading the entire regiment in a cultural great march, etc., all of which are the most vivid and exciting materials in the exhibition.

    The exhibition shows that the troops' cultural education has implemented the "rapid, practical, and yet formal" policy instructed by Chairman Mao. The Qi Jianhua "Rapid Literacy Method," etc., is a typical example of implementing this policy. It can be seen from the exhibition: the strong organizational leadership of the troops' cultural education, the tenacity and mass character of cadres and soldiers in learning, the leading and backbone role of Party and Youth League members, as well as the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of commanders and fighters in the cultural great march, and the great spirit of diligent study, hard work, overcoming difficulties, and mutual assistance. The exhibition particularly reflects the brilliant achievements of the People's Liberation Army in cultural learning since the implementation of the Qi Jianhua "Rapid Literacy Method." For example, in the troops of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army, illiterates and semi-illiterates originally accounted for 80% of the total number of troops, but since January of this year, using the Qi Jianhua "Rapid Literacy Method," after 270 hours of intensive study, the entire army has basically eliminated illiteracy, and by the end of June, 70% to 80% of the students had reached the level of higher primary school (of which 70% had reached the level of higher primary school graduation), and many learning models had emerged, such as Li Guofu, who could only recognize more than 600 characters as a semi-illiterate, and after several months of study, had improved to the level of higher primary school where he could write articles of 3,000 to 4,000 characters. The exhibition is filled with various charts, photos, comic strips, wall charts, lifelike physical objects, assignments, and unusually exquisite teaching aids and instruments invented and created by the vast number of teachers and students, which shows that the people's revolutionary fighters have unparalleled creative genius, and shows that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they have created a miracle in the history of cultural learning that has never been seen in China for thousands of years; It also shows that the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are not only heroes on the front line of the struggle against the enemy, but also heroes on the cultural learning front.

    In addition, the exhibition also has a set of photos brought back by the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning to China to visit the "August 1st" Sports Meet. These photos all reflect our most beloved people—the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—fighting bravely, studying intensively, and living happily on the Korean front, and their great patriotism and internationalism in fighting selflessly to defend the motherland and defend world peace.

    “八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会部队文化学习展览会介绍
    中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会部队文化学习展览会，于八月一日在北京天坛祈年殿揭幕。
    这次文化学习展览会展出全国各大军区、野战军和公安部队的文化学习成绩。展览会内容丰富，有各部队的文化教育计划、文化教育概况、成绩统计、教学经验、典型材料模范人物介绍、指战员新创造的教具模型、文化教学书刊，和部队文化速成学校介绍，立功“创模”运动，以及部队展开大规模文化学习后的新气象等等。已在全国推行的祁建华
    “速成识字法”介绍（包括照片、图片和实物），曹卫民的“算术速成教学法”和经验介绍（包括连环画、模型、文件），曾端仪的新的写字法介绍
    （连环画），全国闻名的英雄文艺战士高玉宝的二十万字的自传小说原稿，永远保持光荣称号的全国战斗英雄王有根、李万余、刘四虎、蔡萼等的学习模范事迹，和全国著名的“塔山英雄团”政治委员陈树福领导全团文化大进军的模范事迹等，都是展览会最生动、精彩的材料。
    展览会表明：部队文化教育执行了毛主席所指示的“速成的、联系实际的，但又是正规的”方针。像祁建华“速成识字法”等，便是贯彻这一方针的典型。从展览会可以看出：部队文化教育坚强的组织领导力量，干部、战士学习的顽强性、群众性，党、团员的带头骨干作用，以及广大指战员在文化大进军中的高度积极性与创造性，和勤学苦练，克服困难，团结互助的伟大精神。展览会特别反映了人民解放军自实行祁建华“速成识字法”以来文化学习的辉煌成绩。例如：中南军区、第四野战军的部队，原有文盲、半文盲占全军人数百分之八十，而自今年一月开始用祁建华“速成识字法”，经过二百七十小时的突击学习后，全军已基本上消灭了文盲，到六月底止，已有百分之七十到百分之八十的学员达到高小程度（其中又有百分之七十达到高小毕业程度），出现了许多学习模范，如李国富由仅能认六百多字的半文盲，经过几个月的学习，已提高到能写三、四千字文章的高小程度。展览会上布满了各种图表、照片、连环画、挂图，逼真生动的实物、作业，和广大教学员所发明创造的异常精致的教学用具、仪器等，说明人民革命战士有着无比的创造天才，表明他们在共产党、毛主席的英明领导下，创造了中国几千年来在文化学习史上所没有过的奇迹；也表明了人民解放军的战士不仅在对敌斗争最前线上是英雄，而且在文化学习战线上同样是英雄。
    此外，展览会还有中国人民志愿军归国参观“八
    一”体育运动大会代表团带回的照片一部。这些照片都是反映我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军英雄们，在朝鲜前线英勇战斗、紧张学习和愉快生活，他们为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平而忘我奋身战斗的伟大爱国主义与国际主义精神。
