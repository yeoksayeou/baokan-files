It was June, but on Mount Que'er, at an altitude of over 5,300 meters, cotton ball-like snow mixed with raindrops and hailstones, drumming against the hood of the car with a clanging sound. The Sixth Company's motorcade set off, the headlights piercing the night, like a several-kilometer-long fire dragon, shimmering and illuminating the winding road, the snow-covered mountains, and the frozen, mirror-like surface. The wind roared in the rain and snow, echoing the rumbling engines all over the mountains. In this mid-winter scene of a snow-covered night march on the Kangzang Plateau, one couldn't help but think that Beijing at this time was in early summer, with lush greenery all over the city, while people in Jiangnan were already fanning themselves to cool off. How vast and expansive our motherland is!

The motorcade stopped, and the lights went out. Platoon Leader Yan Shenghua, the duty officer, shouted: "Comrades! Vehicle No. 93 is stuck in the 'rubber road'!" "Rubber road" is a new term on the Kangzang Plateau. The newly built roads in the high mountains and deep valleys have unstable foundations in some places due to perennial rain, snow, and groundwater. The road surface is elastic, and the wheels sink when they roll over it, and then pop up again after the wheels have passed, so it often gets the vehicles stuck. The tires of Vehicle No. 93 were invisible in the mud pit, and the body was still sinking. All the comrades in the company jumped out of the vehicles, some picking up stones by the roadside, and others digging mud and stones from under the vehicle with their bare hands. At this time, although it was snowing, no one felt cold. After a quarter of an hour of intense struggle, half of the wheels were exposed, and the front and rear of the tires were padded with crushed stones. The engine of Vehicle No. 93 started.

"One, two! One, two! Push hard, folks!" Dozens of hands and a group of shoulders were straining, the wheels moved a bit and then stopped. The second time it started. "One, two! Go!..." Everyone cheered, and Vehicle No. 93 finally escaped safely. At this time, everyone felt that their clothes were soaked and frozen stiff by the rain and snow. Ice had formed on their eyebrows and beards. Everyone grabbed two handfuls of snow, wiped the mud off their hands, jumped into the cab, and moved forward again.

The mountainside of Mount Que'er is the section with the most severe landslides. Especially the section from 48 kilometers to 50 kilometers, there are always more than five collapses within 24 hours. The risk of being buried by a landslide with people and vehicles is very high, but the drivers skillfully and flexibly overcame it. This section is also the section of the Mount Que'er highway construction project with the greatest cost. In order to commemorate the victorious completion of this arduous project, the construction troops erected a monument at 47 kilometers, with the five bright red characters "Conquering Mount Que'er" written on it. Next to it were two couplets, one saying "Hardship is glory; tenacity is victory." The other saying "Heroic spirit runs through Mount Que'er; martyrs' blood paves the Kangzang road."

The Fourth Company's motorcade coming from the opposite side had been staying on the mountain top, where the air was thin, for two days and one night. Although the seven landslides on the road had been repaired, because the mountains were all single-lane roads, they had to wait for the Sixth Company's motorcade to pass at 48 kilometers. Political Instructor Cui Hesheng was seizing this gap to tell the soldiers the story of the Red Army climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands during the Long March. The vehicles were fully loaded, and there was no way to sleep at night. Some comrades spent the night in the cab. Some people were in between two vehicles, in groups of three or five, chatting through the night in the wind and snow. The political instructor told me that the troops had not eaten for thirty-six hours and had only eaten a little substitute flour now. But everyone was full of revolutionary optimism and heroism, talking and laughing freely. Some people grabbed snow and mixed it with substitute flour, joking, "This place is really good, there's 'white sugar' everywhere."

It was one o'clock in the morning, and the top of the mountain was a vast expanse of white. The headlights reflected dazzling light in the ice and snow, and the drivers put on snow goggles. The frozen road surface was very slippery. The Second Vehicle of Comrade Ding Jianrong of the Sixth Company could not climb up because it did not have anti-skid equipment. The wheels were spinning in place. He slammed on the brakes, jumped out of the cab, and unexpectedly slipped and cut a two-inch-long gash in his right hand with a piece of ice, and fresh blood kept dripping on the snow. But he didn't pay attention to these, he scrambled under the vehicle, and felt the icy ground and tires with his left hand. After he crawled out from under the vehicle, he quickly took off his leather overcoat and stuffed it under the right rear tire. The wheels moved a few steps on the slippery ground by the friction of the leather overcoat, then stopped again. At this time, the motorcade behind stopped one after another, and Company Commander Zhai and everyone came together. However, in addition to a few simple repair tools on the vehicle, there were not even a shovel or pickaxe, and everyone could not think of a solution to the hard ice for a while. However, the supplies on the vehicle were urgently needed by the front troops, and no delay was allowed. What should we do? Let's use the overcoats! Everyone took off their overcoats in the cold wind and laid them on the smooth ice marks one after another. Everyone concentrated their efforts to push from behind. The Second Vehicle moved forward.

The sun radiated light from the opposite snow-capped mountain, and the heroes of the Sixth Company victoriously crossed Mount Que'er.

    雀儿山之夜
    周浪声
    时令是六月，但在拔海五千三百多公尺的雀儿山上，棉球般的大雪夹杂着雨点和冰雹，打得汽车引擎盖叮叮当当地发响。六连的汽车队出发了，车灯冲破了夜幕，像一条几公里长的火龙，闪闪烁烁地照耀着弯弯曲曲的公路，照耀着满山的积雪和冻得像镜子的路面。风在雨雪中怒吼，应和着满山轰鸣的马达声。在这康藏高原上雪夜行军的隆冬景象中，不由得使人想起北京这时候正是满城葱绿的初夏，而江南的人则已在摇扇乘凉，我们的祖国是多么辽阔广大啊！
    车队停止了，灯光随着熄灭。值星排长晏生华同志在喊着：“同志们！九十三号车被‘橡皮路’啃住了！”“橡皮路”，这是康藏高原上的新名词。高山深谷间新修的公路，因为终年雨雪和地下水的作用，有的地方路基不实，路面富有弹性，车轮轧上去就下陷，轮子过后又突起来，所以时常把车子卡住。九十三号车的轮胎已陷在泥坑里看不见了，车身还在往下沉。全连同志们都跳下了车，有的人在路旁拣石头，有的人用双手挖着车下的泥和石块。这时，天虽然下着大雪，但谁也没感到冷。经过一刻钟的紧张斗争后，车轮的一半露出地面了，轮胎前后都垫好了碎石块。九十三号车的马达响起来了。
    “一、二！一、二！伙计们用劲推呀！”几十只手和一群肩膀都在使劲，车轮移动一下又停住了。第二次又发动了。“一、二！走！……”大家一阵欢笑，九十三号车终于安全脱险。这时，大家才感觉到衣服都被雨雪浸湿又冻硬了。眉毛上，胡须上都结了冰。每个人抓了两把雪，擦一擦手上的污泥，跳上驾驶室又前进了。
    雀儿山的山腰，是坍方最厉害的一段。特别是四十八公里到五十公里的一节路，二十四小时以内，总要垮五处以上。连人带车被坍方埋掉的危险性是很大的，但驾驶员们都机警灵活地战胜了它。这一段也是雀儿山公路修建工程中代价付得最大的地段。修建部队为了纪念这一艰巨工程的胜利完工，在四十七公里的地方建立了一块纪念碑，上面写着“战胜雀儿山”五个鲜红的大字。旁边衬托着两副对联，一副是“艰苦就是光荣；顽强就是胜利”。另一副是“英雄气概贯串雀儿山；烈士鲜血铺平康藏道”。
    对面过来的四连的车队，已经在空气稀薄的山顶上住宿两天一夜了。路上的七处坍方虽已修好，但因山上都是单行线，所以他们必须在四十八公里的地方等着六连的车队错车。政治指导员崔和生正抓住这一空隙时间，给战士们讲着红军长征中爬雪山过草地的故事。车上装得满满的，夜里根本没法睡。有的同志坐在驾驶室里过夜。有的人就在两个车中间，三五成群地在风雪中摆了一夜“龙门阵”
    （闲谈）。政治指导员告诉我：部队已经三十六小时没有吃饭，现在才吃了一点代饭粉。可是大家都充满着革命的乐观主义和英雄气概，谈笑自若。有的人抓着雪拌代饭粉吃，开着玩笑说：这地方真不错，到处是“白糖”。
    时间是深夜一点钟了，山顶上一片白茫茫。车灯在冰雪中反射出刺目的强光，驾驶员们戴上了防雪眼镜。冰冻的路面滑得很厉害。六连丁健荣同志的二号车没有防滑设备，爬不动了。车轮在原地上打滑。他煞住车跳出驾驶室，冷不防滑了一交，右手被冰块划破了一道二寸来长的口子，鲜血不停地滴在雪地上。但他没有注意这些，一磆碌爬进车底下，用左手摸摸冷得刺骨的冰地和轮胎。他从车底下钻出来之后，迅速地脱下皮大衣，往右边的后轮胎下一塞。车轮借皮大衣的摩擦力，在滑地上前进几步又停下来了。这时，后边的车队一辆紧跟一辆地停了下来，翟连长和大伙儿一齐来了。但车上除了几样简单的修车工具外，连一把洋锹、十字镐都没有，大家对坚硬的冰冻一时想不出办法。可是，车上的物资是前面部队急需的，一刻也不容耽搁。怎么办呢？还是用大衣吧！大家都在寒风里把大衣脱下来，一件接着一件地铺在光滑的冰痕上，大伙儿集中全力在后边推。二号车前进了。
    太阳从对面雪山顶上放射出光芒，六连的英雄们胜利地跨过了雀儿山。
