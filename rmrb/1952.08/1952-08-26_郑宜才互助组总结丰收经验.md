    Zheng Yicai Mutual Aid Group Sums Up Bumper Harvest Experiences
    Editor: The Zheng Yicai Mutual Aid Group in Wuli Township, Shaxi District, Shangrao, Jiangxi Province, planted 13.5 mu of mid-season rice this year, with an average yield of 826.5 jin per mu, an increase of 53.3 percent over last year, exceeding the per-mu mid-season rice yield of 48 single-household farmers in the village this year by 44 percent.
    Recently, the Zheng Yicai Mutual Aid Group (a total of seven households) summarized the following reasons and experiences for the bumper harvest: First, Chairman Mao led the peasants to organize, and collective production has great power; the People's Government provided loans and fertilizers, which solved many difficulties in production; second, last year's rice seeds were all selected by panicle in the field, and the rice seeds were particularly good; third, the whole group adopted the new four-foot-wide nursery method for cultivating seedlings this year, and also applied more fertilizer; fourth, they seized the agricultural season, and the dates of transplanting, weeding, and harvesting were earlier and the time was shorter than in previous years; fifth, the cultivation was meticulous, generally achieving three plows, four harrows, and four weedings; sixth, insect pests were eliminated in a timely manner; seventh, water conservancy was well-repaired and did not suffer from drought. These good methods were all learned from the newspapers.
    They believe that if the mutual aid group can summarize its experiences in each agricultural stage, it will be of great help to the next stage of agricultural production.

    郑宜才互助组总结丰收经验
    编辑同志：江西上饶沙溪区五里乡郑宜才互助组今年种了十三亩五分田中稻，平均每亩产八百二十六斤半，比去年增加百分之五十三点三，超过今年村里四十八户单干户每亩中稻产量的百分之四十四。
    最近，郑宜才互助组（共七户）总结出以下几点丰产的原因和经验：一、毛主席领导农民组织起来，集体生产力量大；人民政府贷款贷肥料，解决了生产上不少困难；二、去年稻种都经过田间穗选，稻种特别好；三、全组今年采用了四尺宽的新式秧田育秧法，又多施了肥；四、抓紧农时，插秧、耘禾、收割都比往年提早了日期和缩短了时间；五、耕作精细，普遍做到三犁四耙四耘；六、及时消灭了虫害；七、水利修得好，没有受旱。这些好办法，都是从报上学来的。
    他们认为互助组如能在每一个农事阶段总结一下经验，对下一阶段的农业生产定会有很大帮助。
