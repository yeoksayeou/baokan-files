(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Progressive newspapers in the United States, Britain, and Austria have commented on the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) to convene the 19th Party Congress, and the draft of the Soviet Five-Year Plan for 1951-1955. According to TASS, the American "Daily Worker" published an editorial stating: All Americans, regardless of their views on socialism and communism, should closely observe the upcoming Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for their own and America's benefit. Past experience has proven that such great conferences make enormous contributions to world history. For example, the Party Congresses in the 1930s that decided to industrialize the Soviet Union with five-year plans within ten years helped save the world from Hitler's conquest. If a non-industrialized Soviet Union had been occupied by Hitler, then Hitler would have been able to turn the knife on America's throat at will. The editorial then pointed out: Just looking at how the billions of appropriations spent on so-called "defense" are undermining the civilian economies of Britain and France, and swallowing up America's social welfare programs and people's incomes, one can understand that a country preparing to attack other countries cannot formulate a five-year plan like the Soviet Union.

The British "Daily Worker" editorial pointed out that the new draft of the Soviet Five-Year Plan stipulates the steps for the Soviet people to continue advancing towards communism under the leadership of the Communist Party.

The "Austrian People's Voice" published an editorial stating: Both friends and enemies believe that the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is an extremely important event. This is a congress for transitioning from socialism to communism, and also a congress for resolutely fighting to maintain world peace.

The bourgeois newspapers in the United States and Britain paid close attention to the news of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In addition to publishing the draft revision of the Party Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in its entirety, the "New York Times" also reported on the reactions in Washington, London, and Paris. When discussing the draft of the new Soviet Five-Year Plan, the British "Manchester Guardian" admitted that after years of post-war construction, the Soviet Union is prepared to use more strength to develop the production of consumer goods and improve people's living standards.

    美英奥进步报纸欢迎联共中央的决定
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：美国、英国、奥地利三国进步报纸纷纷评论苏联共产党中央委员会关于召开第十九次代表大会的决定，和一九五一年—一九五五年苏联五年计划草案。据塔斯社消息：美国“工人日报”发表社论说：所有的美国人，不管他们对社会主义和共产主义的看法怎样，为了他们自己和美国的利益，都应该密切注意即将举行的苏联共产党代表大会。过去的经验证明：这种伟大的会议对世界历史有着巨大的贡献。例如，在二十世纪三十年代里，决定在十年之内以五年计划把苏联工业化的几次党代表大会，就曾帮助拯救世界免于希特勒的征服。如果一个非工业化的苏联被希特勒占领了，那么，希特勒就能够随心所欲地把刀尖转而指向美国的咽喉。社论接着指出：只要看一看用在所谓“防务”上的亿万拨款正在怎样破坏英国和法国的民用经济，怎样吞没了美国的社会福利事业费和人民收入，就可以明白一个准备进攻别国的国家，是制订不出像苏联这样的五年计划的。
    英国“工人日报”的社论指出：苏联新的五年计划草案规定了苏联人民在共产党的领导下继续向共产主义前进的步骤。
    “奥地利人民之声报”发表社论说：不论是朋友和敌人都认为苏联共产党召开第十九次代表大会是一桩极端重要的事件。这是一个从社会主义过渡到共产主义的大会，也是一个坚决为维护世界和平而斗争的大会。
    美国和英国资产阶级的报纸很注意苏联共产党举行第十九次代表大会的消息。“纽约时报”除了用整版的篇幅刊登苏联共产党关于党章的修正草案之外，还报道了华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎等地的反应。英国
    “曼彻斯特卫报”在论到苏联新五年计划草案时承认：经过战后数年的建设以后，苏联已准备用更多的力量来发展消费品的生产并提高人民生活水平。
