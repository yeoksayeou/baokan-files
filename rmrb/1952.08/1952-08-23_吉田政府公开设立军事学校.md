    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 22nd: To adapt to the needs of rearmament, the Japanese Yoshida government recently decided to openly restore military officer schools and establish the so-called "Security University" to specifically train new military cadres.
    The "Security University" is subordinate to the recently established "Security Agency" -- Japan's new disguised military department. Kyodo News Agency admitted that the so-called "Security University" is actually a merger of military schools such as the former Japanese military's officer school and naval academy. According to the "Security Agency's" recruitment regulations for the "Security University" published on the 13th, the school will recruit young people with a high school diploma, implement four years of military training, and after graduation, complete a one-year internship, and then be employed as "Third-Class Security Officer" (equivalent to second lieutenant).
    In addition, according to Kyodo News Agency, the "Security Agency" is also considering establishing a higher-level advanced military school than the "Security University", equivalent to the former Japanese military's Army University and Naval University. Furthermore, some people advocate the establishment of tank schools and air force schools.

    吉田政府公开设立军事学校
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：为了适应重整军备的需要，日本吉田政府最近决定公开恢复军官学校，设立所谓“保安大学”专门训练新的军事干部。
    “保安大学”隶属于最近成立的“保安厅”——日本新的变相的军部。共同社承认：所谓“保安大学”实际上是合并前日本军部的士官学校、海军学校等军事学校而成的。据“保安厅”在十三日所发表的“保安大学”招生章程，该校将招收高中毕业程度的青年，实行四年的军事训练，毕业以后再实习一年，然后以“三等警备士”（相当于少尉）任用。
    此外，据共同社透露，“保安厅”还在考虑设立比“保安大学”更高一级的、相当于前日本军部的陆军大学和海军大学的高级军事学校。另外有一部分人的意见并主张设立战车学校和空军学校。
