    Lhasa Primary School and Middle School Remedial Classes Begin
    The Lhasa Primary School and Middle School remedial classes, jointly established by the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, the Tibetan local government, and enthusiastic educational figures in Lhasa since February this year, officially opened on the 15th of this month. The school currently has more than 600 students, and the principal is the Living Buddha Chijiang. During the opening ceremony, all teachers and students sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, expressing their utmost gratitude. The telegram stated: "We have such unprecedented light and happiness, all brought to us by you. We vow to study hard, strive for progress, be good youths of the motherland, serve the people of the motherland, and serve the people of Tibet!"
    The Academic Performance of Cadets in the Preparatory Class for University Entrance at Peking University Has Generally Improved
    The cadets in the preparatory class for university entrance at Peking University have achieved significant results after a tortuous and arduous learning process.
    At the beginning of their studies, cadets with lower levels used the method of hard study and rote memorization to overcome difficulties. They got up early and went to bed late, did not rest at noon, and did not go out to play on Sundays. Cadets lacked mutual study. The learning effect was very low. The Party branch of the preparatory class studied this situation and the problems in learning, carried out ideological education among the cadres, and proposed adhering to the work and rest system, carrying out mutual assistance, and promoting revolutionary fraternity to solve the difficulties in learning, and summarized and organized the exchange of learning experiences. Under the leadership of the Party branch, everyone corrected their learning attitude and methods, and fully exerted the spirit of unity and fraternity. Students with higher levels helped students with lower levels, carried out collective review and collective research activities, created a method of collectively reading lectures, lecturing and discussing simultaneously, and promoted the "little teacher system." Through these mutual assistance activities, the academic performance of the cadets has generally improved. At present, they are studying intensively, striving to complete the study plan, and ensuring that 100% of the students in the class will be admitted to universities. After completing their studies in the preparatory class, in addition to ethnic minority cadres being admitted to medical schools, the remaining cadres will be admitted to universities for further study in science and engineering.

    北京大学干部入学预备班的学员学习成绩普遍提高
    北京大学的干部入学预备班学员，经过一段曲折坚苦的学习过程，已获得显著成绩。
    学习开始时，水平较低的学员们都用苦读死记的办法来克服困难。起早睡晚，中午不休息，星期天也不去玩。学员们之间缺乏互相钻研。学习效果很低。入学预备班的党支部研究了这一情况和学习中的问题，在干部中进行思想教育，提出了坚持作息制度，开展互助、发扬革命友爱，来解决学习中的困难，并总结和组织了学习经验的交流。在党支部领导下，大家端正了学习态度和学习方法，充分发挥团结友爱精神，水平较高的学生帮助水平较低的学生，展开集体复习和集体钻研活动，创造了集体读讲义，边讲边讨论的办法和推行“小先生制”。经过这些互助活动，学员们的学习成绩普遍提高。目前，他们正紧张地进行学习，争取完成学习计划，保证全班学生百分之百地升入高等学校。这批学员在预备班学习结束后，除少数民族干部升入医科学校外，其余干部均将升入高等学校理工科继续深造。
