    The American Invading Army's Defeat on the Mundung-ni Highway
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Xu Zhilin and He You
    In the continuous mountain range positions of eastern Korea, there are two very strategic high grounds: one is called Eoun Mountain, which is more than 1,270 meters high; the other is called "Heartbreak Ridge" by the enemy, east of Eoun Mountain, which is more than 1,211 meters high. Between the two high grounds, there is a north-south road called the Mundung-ni Highway. This road starts from Wonsan, passes through Mundung-ni, which is defended by our army, and extends to the enemy side. The Mundung-ni area protrudes in front of the eastern front. Last autumn, when the American invading army was advancing on Eoun Mountain and "Heartbreak Ridge," it continuously attacked the small high grounds on both sides of the Mundung-ni Highway, vainly attempting to drive straight north from this lane-shaped area. However, on this position, which is about 1,000 meters wide, the American invading army suffered equally heavy defeats.
    
    In the Mundung-ni area, the Korean and Chinese People's Army bravely and resourcefully struck at the invading enemy. On one occasion, the American invading army used two battalions of troops, under the cover of aircraft, tanks, and artillery fire, to attack a hill close to the west side of the Mundung-ni Highway, launching more than a dozen waves of attacks, all of which were bravely repelled by the soldiers of the ninth squad of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In the end, all the enemies were divided into three groups and rushed towards our army's position. When a part of the enemy troops outflanked the flanks and rear of our army's forward squad, Wang Defu, the squad leader and special-class meritorious soldier of the ninth squad, who was commanding the squad's operation, led the soldiers to attack the enemy back and forth along the traffic trench. When the enemy advanced to 50 meters away from the traffic trench, they used submachine guns to fire fiercely; when the enemy was closer to the traffic trench, they threw grenades; sometimes they also used wooden sticks to prop up a military cap to attract the enemy's fire, so that other soldiers could successfully outflank the enemy's flanks and rear, and fire fiercely at the enemy. In this battle, the squad repelled sixteen attacks by two battalions of enemies at the cost of only one minor injury, killing 250 enemies and holding the position.
    
    The American invading army's infantry loses its combat effectiveness once it loses the coordination of tanks, artillery fire, and aircraft. On one occasion, the enemy used two platoons of troops, with the coordination of artillery fire and tanks, to attack a small hill on the east side of the highway. When a platoon of enemies advanced to 50 meters in front of our army's position, the aircraft and artillery fire lost their effect, leaving only one tank behind to embolden the American soldiers. At this time, the Volunteer Army soldiers asked the squad leader to immediately meet the enemy. The squad leader saw the enemies panting as they climbed up with their guns on their backs and said with a smile: "Don't worry, let the enemy sweat a little more, let them come closer before we annihilate them!" Suddenly, with a loud bang, the tank that was covering the enemy's infantry charge was destroyed by the landmine buried there by our army. The American infantry who were charging immediately lay on the ground, trying to turn around and flee. At this time, the mortar men behind our army's position immediately used fierce artillery fire to block the enemy's escape route, and the soldiers on the position used intensive firepower to quickly annihilate the two platoons of enemies who had come to attack.
    
    In the month from the beginning of October to the beginning of November last year, the enemy used hundreds of tanks in this lane-shaped area to launch the so-called "tank penetration battle," vainly attempting to open a gap and drive straight into the rear of our army, and cooperate with its navy to land in Wonsan, in an attempt to occupy eastern Korea in one fell swoop. However, the American invading army's "penetration battle" using hundreds of tanks was quickly crushed by the Korean and Chinese People's Army. Until now, there are still sixty-eight enemy tanks left on the Mundung-ni Highway. One day, the enemy brought forty-nine tanks at one time, and advanced along the Mundung-ni Highway to a place two miles behind our forward position. The American drivers opened the top covers of the turrets and exposed half of their bodies outside to observe the surrounding movements. At this time, our army's anti-tank units, hidden on both sides of the highway, immediately launched intensive firepower, destroying nine enemy tanks. The remaining tanks immediately turned around and fled, and the enemy infantry behind the tanks also hurriedly rolled back. Early the next morning, the enemy brought more than a dozen tanks again, wanting to pull back the tanks that were destroyed yesterday. Our army soldiers had already anticipated this move and had buried landmines around the damaged tanks. When more than a dozen tanks had just entered the minefield laid by our army, four of them were blown up. In the battle to smash the "tank penetration battle," anti-tank hero Hu Lian destroyed four enemy tanks with seven shells, and the Niu Ruishan squad destroyed ten enemy tanks with landmines. Later, the enemy's tanks did not dare to move in front of our army's position again, and the so-called "tank penetration battle" was completely bankrupt.
    
    After the American invading army and the Syngman Rhee bandit army's infantry and tanks suffered heavy blows from our army, they added many artillery groups behind their positions and continuously bombarded our army's positions. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's powerful artillery units rose up to meet the challenge, inflicting great losses on the enemy's artillery groups. One night, our army's brave artillerymen continuously fired at the enemy's position for forty minutes, and the shells fell like a torrential rain on the enemy's position. From the artillery mirror, it could be clearly seen that the enemy's forward position to several thousand meters behind the position immediately turned into a sea of fire. The enemy's ammunition depot was burning, and many things were flying into the sky in the raging fire. The next day, observer Liu Qingrui saw in the artillery mirror that forty or fifty bunkers on the enemy's positions on both sides of the highway had been completely destroyed, and some American soldiers were frantically digging out the corpses buried in the soil and the remains of the destroyed artillery. Sometimes, the enemy's infantry was scattered and fled by our army's brave artillerymen before launching an attack.
    
    In the ten months from last autumn to the present, the enemy army suffered more than 14,000 casualties (close to a division's strength) in the narrow positions on the Mundung-ni Highway and its flanks, and more than 130 tanks and 65 aircraft were destroyed or damaged. The American invading army no longer dares to be so arrogant on the Mundung-ni Highway. The enemy's tanks hide in the fortifications behind their positions, not daring to move easily; the enemy's infantry also hides in tomb-like bunkers all day long, not daring to show their faces easily. At night, the American soldiers set off many flares on the forward positions to embolden themselves. The brave men of the Korean and Chinese People's Army who are defending the position are increasingly improving their combat confidence in defeating the invading enemy army.

### 美国侵略军在文登公路上的败绩

    美国侵略军在文登公路上的败绩
    新华社记者　许志林　何友
    在朝鲜东部绵亘不绝的山岭阵地上，有两个十分险要的制高点：一个叫鱼隐山，高达一千二百七十多公尺；另一个被敌人称之为“伤心岭”，在鱼隐山的东面，高达一千二百十一公尺。在两个制高点之间，有一条贯通南北的文登公路。这条路从元山起，经过我军守卫着的文登里一直通向敌方。文登里地区突出于东部战线之前。去年秋季，美国侵略军在进犯鱼隐山和“伤心岭”时，并向文登公路两侧的小高地连续猛犯，妄想从这巷形地带向北长驱直入。但是，就在这宽约一千公尺的阵地上，美国侵略军同样遭受了惨重的失败。
    在文登里地区，朝中人民军队英勇机智地打击着进犯的敌人。有一次，美国侵略军用两个营的兵力，在飞机、战车和炮火的掩护下，向紧靠着文登公路西面的一个山头进犯，轮番冲锋十多次，都被志愿军某部第九班的战士奋勇击退。最后，全部敌人分成三路向我军阵地涌来。当一部分敌军迂回到我军前沿小组的侧后时，指挥小组作战的九班班长、特等功臣王得福，率领战士们沿着交通沟来回地打击敌人。当敌人进到离交通沟五十公尺时，他们就用冲锋枪猛烈扫射；当敌人距交通沟更近时，他们就猛投手榴弹；有时他们还用木棍撑起一只军帽来吸引敌人的火力，使另外的战士顺利地迂回到敌人侧后，向敌人猛烈射击。在这次战斗中，这个班仅以轻伤一名的代价，打退了两个营敌人的十六次冲锋，击毙敌人二百五十名，守住了阵地。
    美国侵略军的步兵一旦失掉了战车、炮火和飞机的配合，就丧失了战斗力。有一次，敌人用两个排的兵力，在炮火和战车配合下，向公路东面的一个小山头进攻。当一个排的敌人进到我军阵地前五十公尺时，飞机和大炮都失去了作用，只剩下一辆战车在后面为美国士兵们壮胆。这时，志愿军战士们向班长要求立即迎击敌人。班长看见敌人背着枪气喘喘地向上爬，就笑着说：“不要急，让敌人再出一点汗，放它到跟前来再消灭它！”忽然，轰的一声巨响，掩护敌人步兵冲锋的战车被我军埋在那里的地雷炸毁了。正在冲锋的美国步兵立即伏在地上，想回头逃命。这时，我军阵地后面的迫击炮手们马上用猛烈炮火封锁了敌人的逃路，阵地上的战士们就用密集的火力射击，迅速地歼灭了来犯的两个排的敌人。
    在去年十月上旬到十一月上旬一个月中，敌人用几百辆战车在这一巷形地带发动了所谓“坦克劈入战”，妄图打开一个缺口、向我军后方长驱直入，并配合其海军在元山登陆，一举占领朝鲜东部。但是，美国侵略军使用几百辆战车的“劈入战”，被朝中人民部队迅速地粉碎了，直到现在，文登公路上还留着六十八辆敌军战车的残骸。有一天，敌人
    一次开来了四十九辆战车，沿着文登公路进到我前沿阵地后面二里路的地方，美国驾驶员们打开炮塔的顶盖，将半个身体露在外面观察四周的动静。这时，隐蔽在公路两旁的我军反战车部队立即发射出密集的火力，击毁了敌人九辆战车。其余的战车立刻回头逃窜，在战车后面的敌人步兵也急忙地滚了回去。第二天一早，敌人又开来了十多辆战车，想把昨天被打毁的战车拉回去。我军战士们已经料想到这一着，早在坏战车的周围埋上了地雷。当十多辆战车刚进入我军埋设的地雷区时，就被炸毁了四辆。在粉碎“坦克劈入战”的战斗中，反战车英雄胡连用七发炮弹就击毁了敌人四辆战车，牛瑞山小组用地雷炸毁了敌人十辆战车。后来敌人的战车不敢再在我军阵地前面开动，所谓“坦克劈入战”就彻底破产了。
    美国侵略军和李承晚匪军的步兵和战车遭到我军的惨重打击后，就在其阵地后面增加了许多炮群，不断地向我军阵地轰击。志愿军强大的炮兵部队奋起迎击，使敌人炮群遭受很大损失。有一天晚上，我军神勇的炮手们连续向敌人阵地发射四十分钟，炮弹像骤雨一般地落向敌阵。从炮队镜里可以清晰地看到：敌人的前沿阵地到阵地后方数千公尺处，立刻变成一片火海。敌人的弹药库在燃烧，许多东西在熊熊大火中飞向天空。第二天，观察员刘清瑞在炮队镜里看到在公路两旁的敌人阵地上，有四、五十个地堡被完全摧毁了，有的美国兵正在仓惶地挖掘着埋在土中的尸体和被击毁的大炮残骸。有时，敌人的步兵在发起冲锋之前往往就被我军神勇的炮手们打得四散逃命。
    从去年秋季到现在的十个多月中，敌军在文登公路及其两侧的狭小阵地上伤亡了一万四千人以上（接近于一个师的兵力），被击毁击伤了一百三十多辆战车、六十五架飞机。美国侵略军在文登公路上已经不再敢那么狂妄了。敌军的战车躲在他们阵地后面的工事里，不敢轻意出动；敌人的步兵也整天躲在坟墓般的地堡里，不敢轻意露头。一到晚上，美国士兵们就在前沿阵地上打起许多照明弹来壮胆。而坚守阵地的朝中人民部队勇士们，则愈来愈提高自己击败进犯敌军的战斗信心。
