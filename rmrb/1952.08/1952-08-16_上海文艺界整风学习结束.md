The rectification study movement in Shanghai's literary and art circles has concluded. At the summary meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the East China Study Committee for Literary and Art Circles, held on the morning of July 16th, Shu Tong, Director of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Director of the East China Study Committee, delivered a summary report on the rectification study in literary and art circles. The report pointed out that the entire process of this rectification in literary and art circles proceeded smoothly according to the original plan, generally achieving "rectification without chaos." The study fully promoted democracy, conducted criticism and self-criticism in a serious and enthusiastic manner, exposed and criticized various erroneous literary and artistic thoughts, and put forward various constructive suggestions for improvement, achieving great results.

During this rectification in literary and art circles, the detachment of many literary and art workers from politics and the masses was exposed. This situation was manifested in music mainly as a purely technical viewpoint, disregard for national artistic traditions, and blind worship of the West; in fine arts and opera reform, mainly as a pursuit of personal fame and gain and a serious tendency toward commercialization; and in film and drama, mainly as a conflict between politics and art. Some people carried the burden of progress, thought of their contributions, and were unwilling to shed their expert airs; some people negated technique and displayed egalitarianism and extreme democratization tendencies. These are essentially manifestations of petty-bourgeois individualistic thought. The reason why these thoughts have been able to exist and develop for a long time is that, in addition to historical and social reasons, the leadership's neglect of ideological leadership and its lack of emphasis on the ideological transformation of literary and art workers are also very important reasons.

Through rectification and study, everyone reached a consensus on some fundamental issues: such as literature and art must serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and literature and art should become a good component of the revolutionary cause; literary and art workers must take the ideology of the working class as the sole guiding ideology; petty-bourgeois literary and art workers must integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and carry out ideological transformation for a long time in order to write excellent works that are beneficial to the people; literary and art workers must study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Only in this way can literary and art workers achieve true unity, and literary and art organizations can become organizations of struggle.

Shu Tong also summarized the experience of this rectification and outlined opinions on how to consolidate and develop the results of this rectification in literary and art circles, encouraging everyone to continuously overcome shortcomings, promote achievements, and create a large number of works beneficial to the people on the basis of the rectification movement.

    上海文艺界整风学习结束
    上海文艺界整风学习运动已经结束。在七月十六日上午举行的华东学习委员会上海文学艺术界分会整风学习总结大会上，中共中央华东局宣传部部长、华东学习委员会副主任委员舒同向大会作了文艺界整风学习的总结报告。报告指出此次文艺界整风的全部过程是按原定计划顺利进行的，一般做到了“整而不乱”。在学习中充分发扬了民主，严肃热烈地展开了批评与自我批评，揭露和批判了各种错误的文艺思想，并提出了各种建设性的改进意见，成绩是很大的。
    在这次文艺界整风中，暴露了不少文艺工作者脱离政治、脱离群众的情况。这种情况表现在音乐方面的，主要是单纯技术观点，轻视民族艺术传统，盲目崇拜西洋；表现在美术戏曲改革方面的，主要是个人名利观点、严重的商业化倾向；表现在电影、戏剧方面的，主要是政治与艺术的对立。有些人背上进步包袱、功劳思想、放不下专家架子；有些人否定技术，并有平均主义、极端民主化倾向。这些本质上都是小资产阶级的个人主义思想的表现。这些思想所以能长期存在和发展，除了历史的和社会的原因外，领导方面忽视思想领导，不重视文艺工作者的思想改造，也是很重要的原因。
    经过整风学习，大家在一些基本性质的问题上达到了一致的了解：如文艺必须为工农兵服务，文艺应该很好地成为革命事业的一个组成部分；文艺工作者必须以工人阶级的思想为唯一的领导思想；小资产阶级的文艺工作者必须与工农兵结合，长期地进行思想改造，才能写出对人民有益的优秀作品；文艺工作者必须学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，展开批评与自我批评。只有这样，文艺工作者才能达到真正的团结，文艺团体才能成为斗争的组织。
    舒同并总结了这次整风的经验，和概括地提出了如何巩固与发展此次文艺界整风成果的意见，鼓励大家在整风运动的基础上，不断克服缺点，发扬成绩，大量创作对人民有益的作品。
