Editor's Note: Recently, many readers from various places have written to inquire about the policy regarding the treatment of rich peasants in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Here is a comprehensive reply:

Q: Can rich peasants participate in mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives?

A: Mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives are organizations in which laboring peasants, based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit on the basis of individual economy, implement collective labor. Within mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, the exploitation of hired labor (i.e., the exploitation by rich peasants) is not allowed. It is not allowed for team members or cooperative members to hire long-term laborers to join the team or cooperative, nor is it allowed for mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives to hire long-term laborers to cultivate land. Therefore, generally, rich peasants should not be allowed to participate in mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives.

Q: How should rich peasants who have already participated in mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives be dealt with?

A: For rich peasant elements who have brought hired laborers into mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives, the situation should be clearly explained to the peasants. After the team members and cooperative members have approved, they should be purged. All old rich peasants from before the land reform in old liberated areas, or new rich peasants after the land reform, even if they have not brought hired laborers into the team or cooperative, but attempt to exploit other laborers by taking advantage of the low wages within the mutual aid team, or the remuneration for land, draught animals, and farm tools within the agricultural production cooperative, should generally be subject to democratic discussion within the cooperative or team, and some measures should be stipulated to prevent them from engaging in exploitation within the team or cooperative, and to allow such rich peasant elements who have already joined the team or cooperative to withdraw voluntarily. If the peasants are willing to use their draught animals and farm tools, they may also be allowed to remain in the team or cooperative. However, the foundation of such mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives must be strong, and rich peasant elements must not be allowed to serve as leaders of the mutual aid team or agricultural production cooperative. At the same time, they should be politically controlled to prevent them from engaging in sabotage activities.

The labor price of draught animals and the remuneration for the use of farm tools within mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives should be fair and reasonable, and should not be too low; otherwise, it will be unfavorable to the development of draught animals and the increase of farm tools, and it will also be unfavorable to the newly liberated peasants who currently lack draught animals and larger farm tools.

Q: Can rich peasants organize mutual aid teams on their own?

A: The so-called "mutual aid teams" organized by rich peasants themselves are joint organizations in which rich peasants unite to exploit hired labor, and are not mutual aid teams. Because the relationship between rich peasants and hired peasants is a relationship of hiring and being hired, of exploitation and being exploited, which is fundamentally not a relationship of mutual aid and cooperation. This is completely different from mutual aid teams. It is permissible for rich peasants to unite with each other for production purposes, but they must not be allowed to misappropriate the name of mutual aid teams, so as to avoid causing ideological confusion among peasants and rural cadres.

Q: Is it permissible for rich peasant elements to hire mutual aid team members to work?

A: The issue of rich peasants hiring mutual aid team members to work should be resolved through democratic discussion within the mutual aid team to prevent certain rich peasant elements from using methods such as having cattle and raising wages to lure peasants away from the mutual aid team, split the peasants, and sabotage the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    关于在农业互助合作运动中对待富农的几个问题
    编者按：最近各地很多读者来信，询问关于在农业互助合作运动中对待富农的政策问题。现综合答复如下：
    问：富农是否可以参加互助组或农业生产合作社？
    答：互助组和农业生产合作社是劳动农民在个体经济基础上，本自愿互利的原则，实行集体劳动的组织。在互助组和农业生产合作社内部，不允许进行雇佣劳动的剥削（即富农的剥削），不允许组员或社员雇长工入组或入社，也不允许互助组和农业生产合作社雇长工耕种土地。因此，一般不应允许富农参加互助组或农业生产合作社。
    问：对已经参加了互助组或农业生产合作社的富农应该怎样处理？
    答：对于带雇工参加了互助组或农业生产合作社的富农分子，应该向农民解释清楚，经过组员、社员通过，把他们清洗出去。凡老区土地改革前的旧富农或土地改革后的新富农，虽然未带雇工入组、入社，但企图利用互助组内工资低，或利用农业生产合作社内土地、耕畜、农具的报酬等等条件，以剥削他人劳动者，一般地应在社内或组内发动民主讨论，规定一些办法，使其不能在组内、社内进行剥削，并让这种已经入组、入社的富农分子自动退出。如农民愿意利用他们的耕畜和农具时，亦可允许他们留在组内、社内。但这种互助组或农业生产合作社的基础必须较强，而且不能让富农分子充当互助组或农业生产合作社的领导人，同时应从政治上对他们加以控制，以防止他们进行破坏活动。
    互助组、农业生产合作社内的耕畜的工价和农具的使用报酬，应该公平合理，不要压得太低；否则对于发展耕畜和增添农具是不利的，对于目前尚缺乏耕畜和较大农具的新翻身农民也是不利的。
    问：富农是否可以自行组织互助组？
    答：富农自行组织的所谓“互助组”，是富农联合起来剥削雇佣劳动的合股组织，并不是互助组。因为富农和雇农之间的关系是雇佣和被雇佣、剥削和被剥削的关系，根本不是互助合作的关系。这是和互助组完全不同的。富农为了生产而互相联合起来是可以的，但不能让他们盗用互助组的名义，以免在农民中和农村干部中引起思想混乱。
    问：是否允许富农分子雇用互助组组员做活？
    答：对于富农雇佣互助组员工做活的问题，应经互助组民主讨论，统一解决，以防止某些富农分子利用有耕牛及提高工资等办法引诱农民脱离互助组、分裂农民、破坏互助合作运动。
