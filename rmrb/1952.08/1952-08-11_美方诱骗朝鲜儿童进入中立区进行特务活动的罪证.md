Evidence of US Side Luring Korean Children into Neutral Zone for Espionage Activities

During the Korean armistice negotiations, the US side repeatedly lured Korean children, sending them into the neutral zone for espionage activities. In October of last year, one person was captured by our side, and he confessed in the presence of liaison officers from both sides and many reporters the process of being lured by the US side. The following pictures show a situation on April 10th this year when the US side again attempted to send a deceived Korean child into the neutral zone for espionage activities, but it was discovered by our personnel and was unsuccessful.

Bottom: When the US personnel member saw our photographic reporter paying attention to taking pictures of the child, he used a military blanket to cover the child, wanting to put him in a jeep and escape. The US Chinese translator (marked with ×) attempted to use his body to block the lens of our photographic reporter. (Xinhua News Agency draft)

    美方诱骗朝鲜儿童进入中立区进行特务活动的罪证
    朝鲜停战谈判中，美方曾多次诱骗朝鲜儿童，把他们送入中立区进行特务活动。去年十月曾有一人被我方捕获，他曾当着双方联络官及记者多人面前供认为美方诱骗的经过。下面的图片是今年四月十日美方又企图把受骗的朝鲜儿童送入中立区进行特务活动，但被我方人员发现而未成功的情形。

    下：美方人员见我方摄影记者注意拍摄该小孩照片，就用一床军毡遮住小孩想送上吉普车逃跑。美方中文译员（有×者）企图用身体遮住我方摄影记者的镜头。    （新华社稿）
