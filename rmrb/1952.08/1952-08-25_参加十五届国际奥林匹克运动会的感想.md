    Thoughts on Participating in the 15th International Olympic Games
    Dong Shouyi, Chief Instructor of the Chinese Sports Delegation
    I am a member of the Chinese Sports Delegation participating in the 15th International Olympic Games, and I feel very honored! During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, although I participated in several international sports games, this time is the most pleasant and glorious in my life. In the past, when it came to dispatching representatives (team leaders, instructors, athletes), there were often disputes, factionalism, and open and covert struggles, making many ridiculous situations. When we arrived at the Games, because we were a semi-colonial country, we were often despised by capitalist countries. Due to the low international status of the old China, the poor sports performance, and the lack of funding, the members of the delegation felt inferior everywhere and could not hold their heads high. When participating in the 14th International Olympic Games, the delegation was trapped in England. The reactionary government not only refused to provide assistance, but the "Embassy" and "Bank of China" stationed in England even refused to lend them money for the return trip. The delegation had no choice but to raise money themselves, borrowing from abroad. The "Embassy" and "Bank of China" refused to act as guarantors; as a last resort, they raised travel expenses from overseas Chinese and foreigners before returning home. Looking back, this is such a sad and shameful thing!
    This time we went abroad, the preparations were very thorough. The team leaders, instructors, athletes, and all staff members held one goal: to strive for world peace and strengthen international friendship. Everyone's actions were organized, disciplined, and united in friendship. We participated in the 15th International Olympic Games with a humble and eager-to-learn attitude. Along the way, we received the love and help of the Soviet people. When we arrived in Helsinki, the staff of our embassy and friends from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries came to the airport to welcome us. The Soviet delegation gave us ten rooms as our dormitories; and allocated three cars for our use. At that time, we felt like we were at home abroad. When we arrived at our embassy, the staff asked us all sorts of questions and were very concerned. I deeply felt the preciousness of international friendship and class love, and I almost shed tears of joy! When we held the flag-raising ceremony after our arrival, athletes from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries came to participate, congratulated us, and expressed the unity and sincere friendship of the peace camp. When our national flag fluttered in the sky above the venue, the entire audience and athletes applauded warmly.
    In the competition, the Soviet athletes not only demonstrated amazing achievements in technology, but also showed their excellent style, humble attitude, and noble qualities of being neither arrogant in victory nor discouraged in defeat. The Soviet sports delegation had an unselfish spirit and a forthright attitude. This is because the Soviet athletes grew up under the education of the great Lenin and Stalin, and they have noble communist morality. At the Games, the Chinese sports delegation also demonstrated the spirit of collectivism, internationalism, and the desire to strive for world peace.
    Let's look back at the sports situation in capitalist countries and their true intentions for participating in the Olympic Games. At the International Olympic Committee meeting held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, in 1947, when discussing the invitations for the venue of the 15th International Olympic Games in 1952, there were ten cities inviting: the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, and Italy each proposed one city, and the United States proposed six cities, and their invitations were all supported by big capitalists behind them. Their common goal is to make profits, so they all became puppets for their capitalists to make profits, and conflicts arose between them. In the end, it was decided to hold the Games in Finland.
    When the 11th International Olympic Games were held in Berlin, Hitler shook hands with all the winners at the award ceremony, but when the sprint winner Owens walked up to Hitler, Hitler refused to shake hands with him because Owens was a "black man." This is a manifestation of the racial discrimination of the imperialists.
    The characteristics of American imperialism's sports are commercialization and professionalization. Many athletes use winning championships and breaking records at the International Olympic Games as a means of seeking a career and making money. Capitalists use various sports games to conduct large-scale gambling, thus turning the games into circus-style performances. For example, after the sprinter Owens became famous in the world, he was hired by capitalists to race against horses and sell tickets for profit. Capitalists buy many athletes with excellent results with money and regard them as their trademarks or commodities.
    In order to win a temporary formal victory, they often resort to various despicable and dirty means, and even use heavy money to buy off referees. This is simply insulting sports workers.
    American imperialism's sports, in political terms, are about anesthetizing young people and blurring their class consciousness; in economic terms, they are about commercialization and gambling; in cultural and educational terms, they are about championship-ism and showing-off-ism. All in all, it is backward and corrupt.
    New China's sports have learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and are permeated with the spirit of collectivism and internationalism. All our sports workers should earnestly and honestly intensify their studies and training, and stride forward under the banner of the great Mao Zedong!

### 参加十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的感想

    参加十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的感想
    中国体育代表团总指导　董守义
    我是参加第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会的中国体育代表团的团员之一，我感到很荣幸！在国民党反动统治时期，我虽然曾参加过几次国际运动会，但是只有这次是我有生以来最愉快、最光荣的一次。在派遣代表（领队、指导、选手）的问题上，过去往往发生闹意见、搞宗派、明争暗斗的现象，弄得笑话百出。到了大会，因为我们是半殖民地的国家，常为资本主义国家所鄙视。由于旧中国国际地位的低落，运动成绩的较差，经费的支绌，因此代表团的人员处处感觉自卑，抬不起头来。参加十四届国际奥林匹克运动会时，代表团被困在英国，反动政府不仅不愿接济，而且驻英“大使馆”、“中国银行”甚至拒绝借给返国路费。代表团没有办法，只好自己活动，向外借款，而“大使馆”、“中国银行”却又不肯作保；不得已，才向华侨和外国人募集旅费，始行返国。回忆起来这是多么伤心、多么丢脸的一件事！
    这次我们出国，准备工作做得非常周到。领队、指导、选手及所有工作人员，都抱着一个目的：争取世界和平，加强国际友谊。大家的行动都是有组织、有纪律的，而且团结友爱。我们持着虚心学习的态度，喜气洋洋地参加了十五届国际奥林匹克运动会。沿途受到苏联人民的热爱与帮助。到了赫尔辛基，我国公使馆人员和苏联、人民民主国家的友人都来机场欢迎。苏联代表团为我们让出十间房子，作为我们的宿舍；又拨给我们三辆汽车，供我们使用。那时我们感觉到我们在国外和在自己的家一样。到了我们的公使馆，工作人员向我们问长问短，十分关切。我深深体会到了国际友谊和阶级友爱的珍贵，几乎高兴得掉下泪来！我们到达后举行升旗典礼时，苏联和人民民主国家的运动员们都来参加，向我们祝贺，表示了和平阵营的团结和真挚的友谊。当我们的国旗飘扬在会场的天空时，全场观众和运动员报以热烈的掌声。
    在比赛中，苏联的运动员，不但在技术方面显示了惊人的成就，而且表现了他们的优良作风、谦虚态度和胜不骄败不馁的高贵品质。而苏联体育代表团更有着大公无私的精神和光明磊落的态度。这是由于苏联的运动员是在伟大的列宁、斯大林的教养下成长起来的，他们具有着高尚的共产主义道德。在会场上我国的体育代表团也表现了集体主义、国际主义的精神和争取世界和平的愿望。
    回头来看看资本主义国家的体育情况及其参加奥林匹克运动会的真实企图吧。一九四七年在瑞典京城斯德哥尔摩召开的国际奥林匹克委员会上，讨论一九五二年十五届国际奥林匹克运动会举行地点的邀请书时，邀请者计有十个城市：荷兰、芬兰、挪威、意大利各提了一个城市，美国就提出了六个城市，而他们的邀请都是各有大资本家在背后支持的。他们的共同目的是营利，因此各为各的资本家做了营利的傀儡，彼此之间便发生矛盾。最后还是决定了在芬兰举行。
    第十一届国际奥林匹克运动会在柏林举行时，在发奖会上凡获得第一名者希特勒都一一与之握手，但当短跑优胜者欧文思走到希特勒面前时，希特勒却因为欧文思是“黑人”，竟拒绝与其握手。这是帝国主义者种族歧视的表现。
    美帝国主义体育的特征是商品化、职业化。许多运动员在国际奥林匹克运动会上以夺取锦标、打破纪录作为是一种谋职业和发财的手段。资本家利用各种运动会进行大的赌博，因此把运动会变成了马戏班式的演出。例如短跑家欧文思在世界成名之后，被资本家雇用与马赛跑，售票营利。资本家把许多成绩优良的运动员用金钱收买，当作他们的商标或商品。
    他们为了夺取一时形式上的胜利，往往要用种种卑鄙龌龊的手段，甚至用重金收买裁判员。这简直是在污辱体育工作者。
    美帝国主义的体育，在政治上的表现是麻醉青年、模糊他们的阶级意识；在经济上的表现是商品化、赌博；在文化教育上的表现是锦标主义、风头主义。总起来说，它是落后的、腐朽的。
    新中国的体育，学习了苏联的先进经验，贯穿着集体主义和国际主义精神。我们全国体育工作者应该诚诚恳恳地、老老实实地加紧学习、锻炼，在伟大的毛泽东的旗帜之下大踏步向前迈进！
