    The People's Liberation Army and the National Minorities of Yunnan
    Yong Ting
    Along the thousands of miles of the Yunnan border in the southwest of our motherland, live hardworking and brave national minorities. Here, the Hengduan Mountains conceal rich treasures, and the Lancang and Honghe Rivers border fertile lands. However, these national minorities have long lived in extreme poverty under the reactionary rule of imperialism and domestic feudal forces, especially the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for the past thirty years.
    The People's Liberation Army, stationed in Yunnan, has not only been praised by all ethnic groups for its bravery and excellent discipline for the past two to three years, but has also won the heartfelt support of all fraternal ethnic groups for its vigorous efforts to change the local natural and social landscape, benefiting the people. The national minorities in the border areas of Yunnan all call the People's Liberation Army the "blessed troops" sent by Chairman Mao.
    After entering the border areas of Yunnan, the People's Liberation Army, regardless of difficulties and dangers, first eliminated banditry for the national minorities. They entered uninhabited primeval forests and areas with harsh climates and malaria, climbed cliffs and steep walls, and crossed deep and rapid currents, searching for remnants of bandits everywhere. Over the past two years, with the assistance of the border people, they have eliminated a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's remnants, repelled the intrusions of imperialism and Kuomintang bandits, consolidated the border of the motherland, and enabled the national minorities to live and work in peace and contentment.
    The People's Liberation Army has made every effort to help the national minorities solve their living difficulties. Soldiers of a certain unit stationed in the Hekou and Maguan areas bought salt, needles, thread, and raw tobacco with their own allowances and gave them to the national minorities, and helped them with production and labor. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Tengchong area chopped more than 10,000 catties of firewood, carried more than 17,000 loads of water, and collected more than 800 loads of manure for the local people in twenty days. When the Second Company of a certain regiment was stationed in a certain village, one day, a fire broke out in a village more than thirty miles away, destroying the homes of fourteen Dai families. The entire Second Company built forty houses for the victims in ten days. In Shuangjiang, Gengma and other areas, many mountain village residents had great difficulty in drinking water, and had to travel five or six miles to carry a load of water. The soldiers went up the mountain to cut bamboo poles and connected them into water pipes, delivering clean water directly to the water tanks of each household. Many villages nearby also followed this method and used bamboo pipes as "tap water pipes."
    The border areas of Yunnan are located in the subtropics, where mosquitoes breed easily and malaria is prone to occur. After the People's Liberation Army arrived, they quickly cleared garbage and sewage, and improved environmental sanitation. The national minorities said gratefully: "Since the People's Liberation Army came, even the air has changed!" Influenced by the People's Liberation Army, the national minorities also paid attention to hygiene. They put forward the challenge slogan of "Comparing cleanliness with the People's Liberation Army". Local troops universally organized mobile medical teams and set up temporary hospitals to carry out health propaganda and treat the national minorities. In the Mojiang area of southern Yunnan, some national minorities no longer believe in ghosts and gods because they have been cured of diseases by the medical workers of the People's Liberation Army.
    In order to help the national minorities develop production, the People's Liberation Army has reclaimed many wasteland, and built small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in water-deficient areas, turning wasteland into fertile fields. The troops stationed in the Zhenyue area built a canal more than 3,000 meters long for the local people, which can irrigate fields producing more than 10,000 dan of grain. In some agricultural areas of Cheli, Fohai, and Nanjiao, the People's Liberation Army helped the national minorities improve their farming methods.
    The People's Liberation Army stationed in the border areas of Yunnan also helped the local people open streets and trading sheds, restore old markets that had been destroyed by bandits, and establish some new markets. Places that used to be desolate have now become bustling market towns. In some places, the national minorities had not seen salt for decades, but now they can eat salt. The heroic defenders of the motherland's border used their blood and sweat to open up transportation routes, helping state-owned trading companies to transport goods urgently needed by the national minorities to various markets, and escorting local native products to the interior. The long-stagnant economic arteries of the border areas are circulating, and caravans carrying rice, cotton, and salt come and go in groups, and the sound of horse bells and the echoing sound of horse whips can often be heard in the deep mountains.
    In just two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the lives of the national minorities in the border areas have undergone tremendous changes. The political consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups has also been greatly improved, and many activists, model workers, and militia heroes have emerged. Joint defense teams have been universally organized in the border areas. Men, women, and children have taken up weapons to defend themselves. Men go to the fields with guns, and women and children often question suspicious pedestrians at intersections and hillsides.
    The stories of the People's Liberation Army loving the people have spread throughout the border areas of Yunnan. The song "The East is Red" can be heard in every remote village on the border. The people of all ethnic groups love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The national minorities all know that the People's Liberation Army is their own army. Many national minorities have allowed their outstanding children to join the Chinese People's Liberation Army to defend their happy lives.

    解放军和云南各少数民族
    永汀
    在祖国的西南部长达数千里的云南边境上，居住着勤劳勇敢的少数民族。这里，横断山脉下面蕴藏着丰富的宝藏，澜沧江、红河的两岸是富饶的土地。但是，这里的少数民族过去长期在帝国主义和国内封建势力特别是近三十年来蒋介石匪帮的反动统治下，过着极其贫困的生活。
    进驻云南的人民解放军，两三年来，不仅以英勇善战和良好的纪律为各族人民所称颂，同时还因为他们大力改变当地的自然面貌和社会面貌，造福于人民，而深得各兄弟民族的拥护。云南边疆各少数民族都把人民解放军称为毛主席派来的“洪福部队”。
    人民解放军进入云南边疆以后，不顾艰险，首先为少数民族扫除匪害。他们进入荒无人烟的原始森林和气候恶劣的瘴疠地区，攀登悬崖绝壁，涉过深水急流，到处搜剿残匪。两年来，在边疆人民的援助下，他们消灭了大批蒋匪残余，击退了帝国主义和国民党残匪的进扰，巩固了祖国的边疆，使少数民族得以安居乐业。
    人民解放军曾尽一切努力帮助少数民族解决生活上的困难。驻在河口、马关一带的某部战士，曾以自己的津贴费买了食盐、针线、毛烟送给少数民族人民，并帮助他们生产劳动。驻在腾冲一带的解放军某部，在二十天内为当地群众砍柴一万多斤，挑水一万七千多担，拾粪八百多担。某团二连驻某村时，一天，距驻地三十多里的一个寨子失了火，烧去十四家傣族人民的住宅。二连全体人员就在十天内替灾民盖了四十间房子。双江、耿马一带，有很多山寨居民饮水十分困难，挑一担水要跑五、六里路。战士们便上山砍了竹竿，接成水管，把清水一直输送到各户的水缸里。附近不少的村寨，也都仿照这个办法，用竹管当作“自来水管”。
    云南边疆地处亚热带，是蚊虫繁殖、易生疟疾的地区。解放军来到以后，很快地清除了垃圾、污水，改善了环境卫生状况。少数民族人民感激地说：“解放军来了，连空气也变了！”少数民族人民受到解放军的影响，也讲究卫生了。他们提出了“和解放军比清洁”的挑战口号。各地部队普遍组织了流动医疗队和设立了临时医院，进行卫生宣传，给少数民族人民治病。滇南墨江一带，有些少数民族人民由于被解放军医务工作者治好了病，现在也不信鬼神了。
    人民解放军为了帮助少数民族发展生产，开垦了不少的荒地，并在缺水地区兴修了小型的农田水利，使荒地变成良田。在镇越一带的驻军，为当地人民修筑了一条长达三千多公尺的水渠，可灌溉产粮万担以上的田地。在车里、佛海、南峤某些农业地区，人民解放军帮助少数民族改进了耕作方法。
    驻云南边疆的人民解放军，还帮助当地人民开辟街道和交易棚，恢复过去被土匪破坏了的旧市场，并建立了一些新的市场。过去很荒凉的地方，现在变成了热闹的集市。有些地方的少数民族人民几十年来都没有看见过食盐，现在能吃到食盐了。英勇的祖国边疆的保卫者，用血汗打通了交通要道，帮助国营贸易公司把少数民族急需的货品运送到各集市去，又把当地的土产品护送到内地。久已停滞的边疆经济血脉流通了，载运大米、棉花、盐巴的马帮成群结队地来来往往，深山里经常响着马铃声和前后呼应的马鞭声。
    仅仅两年光景，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在人民解放军的帮助下，边疆少数民族人民的生活已经起了巨大的变化。各族人民的政治觉悟也大大提高了，涌现了不少积极分子、劳动模范和民兵英雄。联防队在边疆各地普遍组织起来了。男女老少拿起了可以自卫的武器。男人们下田带着枪，妇女和儿童经常在路口山岗盘问可疑的行人。
    解放军的爱民故事传遍了云南边疆。边疆上的每一个偏僻的村寨都可以听到“东方红”的歌声。各族人民热爱着毛主席和共产党。少数民族都知道人民解放军是各族人民自己的军队。不少少数民族人民让他们的优秀子女参加了中国人民解放军，保卫自己的幸福生活。
