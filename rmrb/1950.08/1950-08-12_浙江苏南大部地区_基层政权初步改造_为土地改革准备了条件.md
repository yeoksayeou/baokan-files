　　In the rural areas of Zhejiang Province and the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Region, after a year of social reform movements, farmers have been partially organized, bandits have been basically eliminated, and most basic-level political power has been preliminarily transformed, creating conditions for land reform in the autumn.

　　Over the past year, the rural areas of the above two regions have generally undergone a series of mass movements such as suppressing bandits, opposing local tyrants, reducing rent, providing disaster relief through production, and rationally sharing the agricultural tax burden. Due to differences in work progress and various conditions, they can be divided into three types of areas: (1) Areas where bandits have been eliminated, farmer organizations are relatively sound, basic-level political power has been preliminarily transformed, and the political advantage of farmers has been established. This type of area accounts for 70% of the entire Southern Jiangsu region and 30% of Zhejiang Province; (2) Areas where remnant bandits have been eliminated and farmers have been initially mobilized, and the transformation of basic-level political power is continuing. This type of area accounts for 20% of Southern Jiangsu and 60% of Zhejiang Province; (3) Areas where remnant bandits are still active, the farmer masses have not been basically mobilized, and feudal forces still rule the countryside. This type of area accounts for about 10% in both the Southern Jiangsu region and Zhejiang Province.

　　The organization of peasant associations has also made great progress through the above-mentioned movements. According to recent statistics, 80% of the villages in Zhejiang Province have established peasant associations. There are more than 4 million members, accounting for 23.5% of the province's rural population. In the Southern Jiangsu region, more than 90% of the villages have established peasant associations, with a total of 2,928,000 members, accounting for 28% of the rural population. On the basis of the peasant association organization, the "Baojia System" has been abolished in most places, and work has been carried out to divide townships and establish township political power. Farmers in various places democratically elected township government committees at township peasant association member conferences or farmer representative conferences and established township people's governments. At the same time, organizations of militia and self-defense forces were established to automatically assist the people's government in maintaining public security by preventing bandits and special agents. There are now 338,000 militiamen and self-defense forces in the Southern Jiangsu region; Zhejiang Province has 210,000 militiamen and more than 590,000 self-defense forces. These armed forces of the farmers themselves have become an important force for consolidating rural people's political power. However, the peasant movement in the above two regions still has some shortcomings. The main one is that the composition of the peasant association is not pure enough. In individual areas of Southern Jiangsu, landlords, rich peasants, and other saboteurs have infiltrated the peasant associations, embezzling and wasting money and spreading rumors to sabotage. In S Village, Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, half of the 14 village cadres were local bullies and ruffians. They controlled the village political power and shielded landlords, which aroused strong dissatisfaction among the masses.

　　This autumn, land reform will be implemented in areas with 11 million agricultural population in Zhejiang Province and 10 million agricultural population in the Southern Jiangsu region. At present, some areas of Zhejiang Province are starting to rectify peasant associations in conjunction with the current production movement and cultivate a large number of active farmers to enrich the rural farmer organization structure with new forces. Other areas are also carrying out appropriate rectification based on different circumstances in order to fully prepare for the upcoming land reform movement.

### 浙江苏南大部地区  基层政权初步改造  为土地改革准备了条件

　　浙江苏南大部地区
    基层政权初步改造
    为土地改革准备了条件
    【新华社上海八日电】浙江省和苏南行政区的农村，经过一年来的社会改革运动，农民们已经部分地组织起来，土匪已被基本肃清，大部分基层政权也经过初步改造，为秋后的土地改革准备了条件。
    上述两个地区的农村，一年来，大都经过了剿匪、反恶霸、减租、生产救灾、农业税合理负担等一系列的群众运动。因为工作的进度和各种条件的不同，到目前为止，可分为三种类型地区：（一）土匪业已肃清，农民组织比较健全，基层政权经过初步改造，农民的政治优势已经确立。这种地区在苏南占了全区百分之七十，在浙江省占了全省百分之三十；（二）股匪已经肃清，农民亦已初步发动，现在正在继续改造基层政权。这种地区在苏南占了百分之二十，浙江省占了百分之六十；（三）目前还有股匪活动，农民群众基本上还没有发动，封建势力还统治着农村。这种地区在苏南区和浙江省均为百分之十左右。
    农民协会的组织，通过上述各种运动，亦已获得很大的发展，据最近统计：浙江省已经有百分之八十的乡村建立了农民协会。会员共有四百多万，占全省农村人口的百分之二十三点五。苏南全区已经有百分之九十以上的乡村建立了农民协会，会员共有二百九十二万八千人，占农村人口的百分之二十八。在农民协会组织的基础上，大部分地方废除了“保甲制度”，进行了划乡和建立乡政权的工作。各地农民在乡农民协会会员大会或农民代表会议上，民主选举了乡政府委员会，成立了乡人民政府。同时并建立了民兵、自卫队的组织，自动地协助人民政府进行防土匪、防特务的治安工作。苏南地区现在有民兵、自卫队三十三万八千人；浙江省有民兵二十一万，自卫队五十九万多人。这些农民自己的武装已成为巩固乡村人民政权的重要力量。但上述两个地区的农民运动目前还存在着若干缺点。其中主要的是农民协会的成份还不够纯洁。苏南个别地区的农民协会，混入了地主、富农和其他破坏分子，他们在农民协会中贪污浪费进行了造谣破坏活动。浙江省东阳县斯村的十四个村的村干部，半数是地痞流氓分子。他们把持村政权，包庇地主，深为群众不满。
    今年秋后，浙江省将有一千一百万农业人口的地区，苏南区将有一千万农业人口的地区实行土地改革。目前，浙江省一部分地区正在结合着当前的生产运动，开始整顿农民协会，培养大批的农民积极分子，以便以新的力量充实乡村农民组织机构。其他地区也正在依据不同的情况进行适当的整顿，以便全力做好一切准备工作，迎接即将到来的土地改革运动。
