　　Wuhan Vigorously Promotes Land Reform Policy
    Over Ten Thousand Teachers and Students are Engaged in In-Depth Study, and a Propaganda Campaign will be Organized Among Over One Million Citizens.
    [Report from this Newspaper] The land reform propaganda and education work in Wuhan City has gradually unfolded and has already achieved some results. The city's land reform propaganda and education work is being carried out under the leadership of the Municipal People's Government, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, the Municipal Youth League, the Education Department of the Central-South Region, and the Central-South Land Committee. After the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, the city vigorously promoted it through newspapers and radio stations. The Municipal People's Government also convened an enlarged meeting of the Consultative Committee to convey the report on land reform from the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and conducted discussions. The Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce also held two land reform symposiums. Currently, those who have already engaged in land reform study include over two thousand teachers from the summer study group led by the Municipal Education Bureau, over eight thousand students from the Youth Summer School, and over four hundred unemployed and out-of-school youth. On this basis, the city will conduct planned and organized propaganda and hold symposiums in industrial and commercial circles, cultural circles, and trade unions, and launch a widespread land reform propaganda and education campaign among the 1.1 million people in Wuhan and farmers in the suburbs.
    In the land reform studies and symposiums that have already been conducted, some initially only cared about the relationship between land reform and their own families; some only generally expressed support for land reform; some believed that land reform was only a matter for farmers and the People's Government and had nothing to do with themselves. Teachers and students often did not know where to start studying, and coupled with the "leftist" deviations that had occurred in past studies, their enthusiasm was not high. In response, the responsible cadres leading the study in the city promptly carried out enlightenment education, advocated freedom of thought, and democratic discussion. Only then did the atmosphere of learning become lively, and many questions were raised. However, at the beginning, each unit was still limited to fragmented questions of wording or individual doubts, and no ideological activity was evident. The personnel leading the study promptly provided enlightenment, organized discussions on policies toward landlords, rich peasants, industrialists and businessmen, and small land renters, and especially emphasized the need to understand the significance of land reform and why it is necessary to mobilize the peasant masses. Everyone was educated to withstand the test in the land reform movement and to always stand with the people.
    The study method focused on using effective small-scale symposiums and cultivating core members. The advantages of small-scale symposiums (including discussion meetings and question-and-answer sessions) are: they can fully expose one's thoughts, give full play to freedom of thought, conduct thorough research and discussion, allow the masses to raise questions themselves, and then obtain solutions, in whole or in part, through their own learning, thinking, and research; at the same time, the personnel leading the study can also guide and improve on the existing level of the masses' ideological problems. This kind of study can become a real mass self-study movement. This method has been well received by learners. Adopting this method was difficult at the beginning, especially because teachers and students were accustomed to lecturing; the cadres leading the study also lacked experience. These difficulties must be resolved.

　　武汉大力宣传土改政策
    已有教员、学生万余人进行深入学习，将有组织地在百余万市民中开展宣传运动。
    【本报讯】武汉市的土地改革宣传教育工作已逐步展开，并已获得若干成绩。该市的土改宣传教育工作，是在市人民政府、中共市委宣传部、市青年团、中南区教育部、中南土地委员会的领导下进行的。土地改革法公布后，该市通过报纸、广播电台大力进行了宣传，市人民政府并召开了协商委员会扩大会议，传达了人民政协全国委员会二次会议有关土地改革的报告，并进行了讨论。市工商联合会也召开了两次土改座谈会。目前已经进行了土改学习的有市教育局领导的暑期学习团的两千余教员，青年暑期学园八千余学生，以及四百余失学失业的青年。在这个基础上，该市将有计划地有组织地在工商界、文化界和工会中进行宣传和举行座谈会，在武汉市一百一十万群众和郊区农民中展开广泛的土改宣传教育运动。
    在目前已经进行的土改学习和座谈中，开始有的只关心土改对自己家庭的关系；有的只笼统地表示拥护土改；有的认为土改只是农民和人民政府的事，与自己无关。教员、学生则多不知从何学起，加上过去在学习中曾发生过“左”的偏向，因而情绪不高。对此，该市领导学习的负责干部及时地进行了启发教育，提倡思想自由，民主讨论之后，学习气氛才浓厚起来，并提出了许多问题。但开始时，各单位仍局限在辞句或个别怀疑的零碎问题上，看不出思想活动。领导学习的人员又及时地加以启发，组织讨论了对地主、富农、工商业家、小土地出租者的政策，并特别提出应认识土地改革的意义和为什么必须发动农民群众等问题。教育大家在土地改革运动中要受得住考验，能够始终和人民站在一起。
    学习的方法，着重运用了有效的小型座谈会及培养骨干分子。小型座谈会（包括讨论会、解答问题会）的好处是：能尽情地暴露自己的思想，发挥思想自由，充分进行研究讨论，让群众自己提出问题，又经过自己的学习、思考、钻研，全部或部分地获得解决；同时，领导学习的人员也可以针对群众的思想问题，在现有水平上加以引导与提高。这种学习可以成为真正的群众自学运动。这种方法，已获得学习者的好评。采取这种方法，开始是有困难的，特别是教员与学生习惯于讲授的方式；领导学习的干部，也缺乏经验。这些困难必须加以解决。
