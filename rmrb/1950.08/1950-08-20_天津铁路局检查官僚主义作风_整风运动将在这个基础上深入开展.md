　　Tianjin Railway Bureau Checks Bureaucratic Work Style
　　Rectification Movement to be Carried Out in Depth on This Basis
　　[This newspaper's Tianjin dispatch] The Tianjin Railway Bureau, in response to Minister Teng's call, began checking bureaucratic work styles in mid-June, laying a good foundation for the bureau's rectification campaign.

　　Earlier this month, Liu Jianzhang, Deputy Director of the Bureau, made a summary report on anti-bureaucracy, believing that since liberation, after more than a year of political study, the political consciousness of most employees has improved, and they have demonstrated a high degree of responsibility in their work, thus enabling the people's railway to achieve certain results; but there is still a group of people who are passive in their work, "tolling the bell like a monk for a day," "not seeking merit, but seeking no demerit," and treating their work with a perfunctory attitude. For example, the Planning Department summarized the incentive work in May, listing the amount of coal saved by locomotives as more than 310,000 tons, while the actual coal consumption of locomotives throughout the entire railway was only more than 37,000 tons. After review by the Awards and Penalties Section and the Materials Section, the amount of coal saved by the three sub-bureaus was only more than 1,600 tons. Therefore, the coal-saving figures in the Planning Department's summary were 194 times higher than the actual provincial figures, nearly eight times the total coal consumption of locomotives. Such an astonishing figure was not discovered by the personnel and planning departments responsible for this matter, and it was sent to the director as is. If bonuses were issued according to 30% of this amount, it would be equivalent to issuing two and a half months of locomotive coal consumption. Wouldn't such a calculation of savings be a big joke? Many official documents are stamped layer by layer, but no one is responsible, and they are reduced to formalities. For example, the Tianjin Exchange has 1.6 million telephone tickets in stock, but their superiors – the Communications Section of the Telecommunications Department – did not know about this, and planned to print another 1.05 million tickets and 50,000 covers. The person in charge was careless and reversed the two figures, but after the section chief, department chief, and division chief stamped their seals layer by layer and sent them for printing, the result was: the covers were enough for the entire railway for twenty years, while the telephone tickets were only enough for the Tianjin Exchange for one month. This is a concrete manifestation of being completely irresponsible to the people's cause.

　　The phenomenon of the bureau formulating plans divorced from reality is very serious. The Engineering Department drafted the construction project plan for the first and second quarters of 1950, but did not include the unfinished projects of 1949, thus affecting the completion of the original plan. On the other hand, the volume of traffic on the Beijing-Baotou line is small this year, and the existing tracks are sufficient, but it is planned to extend the tracks of 31 stations until after the inspection of the Beijing-Suiyuan line that this plan was changed. There are many other things that are divorced from reality. For example, the 1950 telecommunications budget has been worked on since the end of last year. In order to scrape together a certain sum of money, it has been revised again and again, and now half a year has passed, and the operating budget has not yet been made. This is a typical example of treating the budget as an ornament to decorate the facade, and the budget has become a "final account."

　　Little understanding of the situation below, working blindly, plans divorced from reality.

　　Although the general leading cadres of the bureau can pay attention to going deep into the field, some people do not often check their work, do not actively study and analyze reports, and know very little about the situation below, and their work is full of blindness. For example, when promoting the new telecommunications maintenance method, they do not know how many contracted maintenance groups each section has, what they are contracting to maintain, and they are not clear about the organization and work of the telecommunications engineering team. The Xigu public security personnel helped the old gang leader interrogate the head of the trade union and ordered him to stop work and reflect. The Public Security Section locked this serious error of losing position and violating the law in the iron cabinet, and the leaders did not know about it until the Workers' Daily published it, and they were greatly surprised.

　　In the past year or so, the bureau's leadership has made achievements in opposing paperwork, and the directors' official documents have been much less, but the framework of paperwork throughout the entire bureau has not been basically broken down, so many things are still handled according to the usual practice, from the director approving and handing it over to the department chief, the department chief handing it over to the section chief, the division chief, the staff member, and some staff members have to hand it over to the clerk; then the clerk or staff member drafts the document, which is reviewed by the division chief, section chief, and department chief level by level until the director, and each person reads it twice and stamps it twice, which takes ten and a half days, or even delays it for several months before the problem can be solved.

　　Some departments of the bureau lack scientific organization and division of labor, and the chaos is quite serious. "When work comes, everyone is in a mess." "I don't know what will happen tomorrow." Some people are idle all day long, doing nothing, while others spend their limited energy dealing with trivial matters from all directions. Because the division of labor is unclear between superiors and subordinates, and between colleagues, some shirk responsibility to each other, which affects work. For example, for the improved signal project at Fengtai Station, the sub-bureau believed that the materials were supplied by the management bureau, and the management bureau believed that the sub-bureau was responsible. No one took the initiative to discuss a solution, which eventually delayed the project.

　　Busy work conceals the essence of bureaucracy

　　In addition, there are also some hardworking office workers in the bureau who are terribly busy all day long, arriving early and leaving late, not eating well, not sleeping well, and indeed not doing their work well. They conceal the essence of bureaucracy with a busy form.

　　Liu Jianzhang, Deputy Director of the Bureau, pointed out that although these bureaucratic practices are only a part, they are enough to hinder the progress of the bureau's work. In order to thoroughly eliminate bureaucracy, the bureau decided to continue to implement the rectification study on the basis of this anti-bureaucracy campaign. Cadres above the department chief level of the bureau will be concentrated in the bureau for rectification before August 15, and cadres at the section and department chief level will be concentrated for rectification by the end of September.

### 天津铁路局检查官僚主义作风  整风运动将在这个基础上深入开展

　　天津铁路局检查官僚主义作风
    整风运动将在这个基础上深入开展
    【本报天津讯】天津铁路管理局为响应滕部长号召，从六月中旬开始进行检查工作中的官僚主义作风，为该局整风打下了良好基础。
    本月上旬，该局刘建章副局长作反官僚主义的总结报告，认为该局自解放以来，经过一年多的政治学习，大部职工的政治觉悟提高了，在工作中表现了高度负责的精神，因而使人民铁路获得了一定成绩；但是还有这样一批人，他们对工作消极，“当一天和尚撞一天钟”，“不求有功，但求无过”，以敷衍支应的态度来对待工作。如该部计划处总结五月份奖励工作，所列机车节煤量即达三十一万多吨，而实际全路机车用煤不过三万七千多吨，经奖惩科、经材科审核结果，三个分局节煤量仅一千六百多吨，因此计划处总结中节煤数字较实省数字多算了一九四倍，几近全部机车用煤的八倍。如此惊人数字，负责此事的人事、计划两处，均未发现，竟照样送给局长。假如按照此数的百分之三十发放奖金，那末就等于发出两个半月的机车用煤，如此计算节约，岂不闹大笑话。不少公文层层盖章，但均不负责，流于形式。如天津交换所存有通话票一百六十万张，他们的上级——电务处通讯科不知道，又计划印一百零五万张，封皮五万张，承办人工作粗心，将两项数字颠倒，但经过股长、科长、处长层层盖章、送印结果：封皮足够全路二十年用，而通话票仅够天津交换所用一个月。这是对人民事业毫不负责的具体表现。
    该局制订计划时，脱离实际的现象是十分严重的。工务处草拟一九五○年第一、二季建筑工程计划，未把一九四九年未完工程包括在内，因此影响原计划的完成。另一方面，京包线今年运量少，原有股道已经够用，却又计划延长三十一站股道，直至京绥线巡视以后，才改变了这个计划。其他脱离实际的事情也是很多的。如一九五○年电务概算从去年年底做起，为了凑小米凑钱数，改了又改，到现在已经半年过去，营业概算还没作出来，这是典型的把预算当做点缀门面的装饰品，预算成了“决算”。
    很少了解下情，工作盲目，计划脱离实际。
    该局一般领导干部虽能注意深入现场，但还有些人不常检查工作，不主动研究分析报告，对下面情况了解很少，工作中充满盲目性。如推行电务新维修法，不知各段有了多少包修组，包修些什么，对于电务工程队的组织情况，工作情况都不明了。西沽公安人员帮助旧脚行头子审问工会负责人，并令停工反省，这种丧失立场违反法纪的严重错误，公安科却把公文锁进了铁柜，领导上不知道，等到工人日报发表以后，才大吃一惊。
    一年多来，该局领导上反文牍主义是有成绩的，局长们的公文少得多了，但整个路局的文牍架子基本上没打垮，因此不少事情还照例行文，从局长批交处长、处长交科长、股长、科员，有的科员还要交事务员；再由事务员或科员办稿经股长、科长、处长逐级批阅直到局长，每人看两遍，盖两次章，就得周转十天半月，甚至耽误几个月，问题才得解决。
    该局若干部门缺乏科学的组织与分工，混乱现象相当严重。“工作来，大家乱忙一起。”“今天不知明天事。”工作闲的饱食终日、无所用心，有的却把有限精力应付四面八方来的琐事。上级与下级，同级与同级之间，因分工不明确，有些彼此推诿责任，影响工作。如丰台车站的改良信号工程，分局认为材料由管理局供给，管理局认为由分局负责，谁也不主动商讨解决，终于延误了工程。
    忙忙碌碌掩盖了官僚主义的实质
    此外，该局还有一种辛辛苦苦的事务主义者，他们成天忙得要命，早到迟退，饭也吃不好，觉也睡不好，工作也确实没有做好，他们以忙忙碌碌的形式掩盖了官僚主义的实质。
    该局刘建章副局长指出：上述这些官僚主义虽只是一部分，但足以妨碍该局工作的进步。为了彻底肃清官僚主义，该局决定在这次反官僚主义的基础上，继续贯彻整风的学习，该局处长级以上的干部在八月十五日前集中局内进行整风，科、段长级干部于九月底集中整风。
