Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 12th: The Third Northwest Youth Congress has determined the specific guidelines for mobilizing over four million youths of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life in the Northwest. The congress was held in Xi'an from July 30th to August 6th, and the Northwest Democratic Youth Federation was officially established at the meeting. Fifty-seven executive committee members of the Democratic Youth Federation were elected, and they mutually elected Luo Yi as chairman, and Saifula Ye夫拉也夫 (Uyghur), Wang Wei 王维, and Ma Teng'ai 马腾霭 (Hui) as vice-chairmen.

　　Among the 361 youth representatives from all walks of life attending the congress were from twelve ethnic groups, including Han, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Mongolian, Uzbek, Russian, Kazakh, Tatar, Tu, Xibe, and Salar, of which 39 were combat heroes and labor models from various regions, representing over 700,000 organized youths in the Northwest. The congress summarized the experience of the Northwest youth movement in the twelve years since the Second Youth Congress held in Yan'an in 1938, and discussed and adopted the current tasks of the Northwest youth movement and the charter of the Northwest Youth Federation. The congress decided that the current task of the Northwest youth movement is to mobilize over four million youths in the entire Northwest, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, to actively participate in production and construction and to play a vanguard role in their work; at the same time, it is necessary to lead the youth to carry out a broad study movement to meet the special requirements of the youth. In the youth work in the areas of various fraternal ethnic groups, we should first mobilize the intellectual youth of all ethnic groups to study the ethnic policies and revolutionary theories of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, in order to blend the feelings of the youth of all ethnic groups and cultivate the spirit of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and friendship, and then through them, go deep into the broad youth and the masses of people of all ethnic groups to promote the unity among the people of all ethnic groups. For the industrial, agricultural, and pastoral youths of the fraternal ethnic groups, we should first start from seeking their immediate interests, and at the same time, mobilize youth cultural workers and scientific workers to work in the fraternal ethnic areas. The congress pointed out that all the youths in the Northwest should, together with the youths across the country, under the leadership of the All-China Youth Federation, actively respond to and implement all the calls and resolutions of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and strive to defend world lasting peace and win a better future for the youth. The congress passed a congratulatory telegram to the Korean Democratic Youth and General Kim Il-sung, and a telegram protesting against the American aggression against Taiwan and Korea.
