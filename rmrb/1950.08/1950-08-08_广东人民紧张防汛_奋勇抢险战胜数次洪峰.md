Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th: The major rivers in Guangdong Province, including the Pearl River, the Han River, and the East River, West River, and North River in the upper reaches of the Pearl River, have experienced several flood peaks this year. However, thanks to the efforts of the people along the rivers in fighting the disasters, no serious floods have occurred. At present, the province is concentrating its efforts, taking advantage of the intervals between flood peaks, to strengthen flood prevention work.

The floods in this province arrived particularly early this year. In late April, the water levels of the East River, North River, and Han River in the upper reaches of the Pearl River exceeded the danger level. The West River in early May rose to or approached the danger level. Therefore, some areas had to fight the flood before the spring repairs were completed. During the period of the flood outbreak, local people's governments and water conservancy engineering personnel led the people to fight the floods day and night, so that the vast majority of the 4.5 million mu of land protected by all the dikes were not affected by the floods. Due to dike breaches, mountain floods, and the inability to drain accumulated water, approximately one million mu of land were flooded in the nine counties of Deqing and Yunan along the West River, Xinhui and Heshan in the Pearl River Delta, Zengcheng in the Zeng River, Xingning and Wuhua in the upper reaches of the Han River, Huilai in the Long River, and Xinyi in the Dou River. Now the water levels of the rivers have receded, and the disaster situation in the affected areas has been greatly alleviated through the people's vigorous efforts to repair breaches and drain water.

The next forty days will still be a dangerous period for flood season for the major rivers in the province. The South China Sub-Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, and the Guangdong Military Region Headquarters jointly issued instructions on July 18 to strengthen flood prevention work, requiring people's governments at all levels to strengthen flood prevention organizations, accurately grasp water conditions, inspect dikes, mobilize the masses, concentrate efforts to protect dikes and fight disasters, and overcome complacency to avoid unexpected disasters. The Pearl River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau has prepared a large number of flood prevention materials, and the engineering teams of each river are still working hard to continue to complete the project of thickening and raising the dikes. The people's governments of the disaster-stricken areas have distributed relief grain and mobilized the masses to work in exchange for relief, rushing to repair dangerous works. For example, in Huilai County, which was severely affected by the disaster, more than 35,000 mu of land were flooded by mountain torrents. The local people's government has loaned more than 370,000 jin of grain and mobilized workers to fight the disaster. Ninety percent of the breached dikes have now been repaired.

　　广东人民紧张防汛
    奋勇抢险战胜数次洪峰
    【新华社广州六日电】广东省境的珠江、韩江及珠江上游的东江、西江、北江等主要河流今年已先后发生数次洪峰，但经沿江人民抢险，未酿成严重水灾。现该省正集中力量，利用洪峰间隙，加强防汛工作。
    该省今年洪水到的特别早，四月下旬珠江上游的东江、北江及韩江涨水即已超出危险水位，西江在五月初涨水超出或接近危险水位。因此，有的地区春修未完工即须抢险。在洪水暴发期间，各地人民政府和水利工程人员领导人民日夜与洪水搏斗，使全部堤围所保护的四百五十万亩地，绝大部分未受水灾。西江沿岸的德庆、郁南，珠江的新会、鹤山，增江的增城，韩江上游的兴宁、五华，龙江的惠来，窦江的信宜等九县，因堤围决口，山洪暴发和积水无法排泄等缘故被淹田约一百万亩。现各江水势已退，受灾地区经人民大力抢堵和排水，灾情已经大大减轻。
    今后四十天内，仍是该省各主要河流的洪汛危险期。中共中央华南分局、广东省人民政府及广东军区司令部于七月十八日联合发出加强防汛工作的指示，要求各级人民政府加强防汛组织，确实掌握水情，检查堤防，动员群众，集中力量护堤抢险，克服麻痹心理，以免发生意外的灾害。珠江水利工程局已准备好大批防汛器材，各江工程队仍在加紧工作，继续完成培厚加高堤防的工程。被灾地区人民政府已发放救济粮食，并发动群众以工代赈，抢修险工。如灾情较重的惠来县，被山洪淹地三万五千余亩，该地人民政府已贷粮三十七万余斤，动员民工抢险，现已修复决堤百分之九十。
