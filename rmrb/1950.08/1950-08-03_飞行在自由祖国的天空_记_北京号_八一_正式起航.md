　　Flying in the Sky of the Free Motherland
    ——A Record of the Official Inauguration of "Beijing" and "August 1st"
    Tian Liu
    From "August 1st" 1950, the Chinese people's civil aircraft have officially been flying in the skies of the free motherland. The vast and expansive land of the motherland will henceforth have its distances greatly shortened and its connections strengthened. Passengers, mail, and goods transported by air will be delivered to various places throughout the country with air routes within a few hours. The "Beijing" plane flew from Guangzhou to Tianjin on this great day of "August 1st".
    On this day, the motherland's earth and sky appeared particularly joyful and clear. In various cities and vast villages, everyone was jubilant, flags were flying everywhere, and hundreds of millions of people were enthusiastically celebrating the birth festival of their protectors—the People's Liberation Army. And in the skies of the motherland, the first civil aviation flight of the Chinese people was carrying passengers, taking off separately from Tianjin and Guangzhou, and flying to Chongqing and Tianjin.
    The plane taking off from Guangzhou was named "Beijing" after the people's capital. It was a giant "air palace" type aircraft that took the lead in flying to the embrace of the people's motherland on November 9th last year, carrying the managers of the China and Central Aviation Corporations and the telegraphic letters of uprising from thousands of employees. It can carry forty passengers and is equipped with sound and air pressure regulators. When the reporter boarded the plane with the passengers and took off from Guangzhou, representatives from all walks of life in South China and Guangzhou who participated in the opening ceremony waved their hats, cheered, and applauded enthusiastically, and the honor guard played the majestic national anthem. After circling once to bid farewell to the send-off party, we ascended to a height of eight thousand five hundred meters and flew north at a speed of two hundred and sixty miles per hour. We successively crossed the four major river basins of the Pearl River, Yangtze River, Huai River, and Yellow River, flying from the undulating mountains of South China to the boundless plains of North China. The sky of the motherland we passed through was beautiful, with strangely shaped white clouds embedded in the clear blue sky; overlooking the earth, there were green hills and valleys everywhere, and fertile fields in neat rows; tens of thousands of rivers and streams were like a silver network intertwined among the green fields. At noon, we and the plane that took off from Tianjin landed at Hankou Airport one after another. Passengers shook hands with each other to congratulate each other, and the welcoming crowds presented flowers to the pilots, draped the plane in colorful silk, and took pictures, celebrating for a full two hours. At 3:10 p.m., we took off again and flew to Tianjin. When we arrived at Tianjin Airport at 6:10 p.m., 40,000 soldiers and civilians of Tianjin were enthusiastically gathering to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day and hold a grand demonstration against American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea.
    The revolutionary Chinese people have never had their own air transportation tools. Before the basic victory of the national liberation war, our main means of transportation was our two feet. In the long and difficult days, the revolutionary people relied on their feet to fight against the enemy who possessed airplanes, cars, trains, and all means of transportation. In 1948, when the Fourth Field Army entered the customs to fight, they wrote the slogan "Victory on Foot" in Shanhaiguan. Now, we have used the enemy's cars to build our own motorized troops, used the enemy's airplanes to build the People's Air Force, and the railways have also been liberated from the hands of the enemy and become the people's own railways. And today—on the great festival of the glorious 23rd anniversary of the founding of the army, the people's own civil aviation industry has also begun to operate.
    The Chinese people's civil aviation industry officially opened on the "August 1st" Army Day, marking that it will gradually grow from small to large and from weak to strong like the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    The future is limitless. Civil aviation workers should make arduous efforts.
              Written on "August 1st" Army Day in Tianjin, 1950

　　飞行在自由祖国的天空
    ——记“北京号”“八一”正式起航
    田流
    从一九五○年“八一”开始，中国人民的民用飞机，已在自由祖国的天空正式航行了。辽阔广大的祖国大地，从此将大大地缩短距离，加强联系。经空运的旅客、邮件、货物，将在几小时之内运到全国有航线的各地。“北京号”就是在“八一”这伟大的日子，由广州飞向天津。
    这一天，祖国的大地和天空，显得格外愉快和爽朗。在各个城市和广大乡村中，人人欢欣鼓舞，处处旗帜飘扬，亿万人民正热烈庆祝自己的保卫者——人民解放军的诞生节日。而在祖国的天空，中国人民的民用航空首次班机，正载负着旅客分别从天津、广州起飞，向重庆、天津飞行。
    从广州起飞的班机，是以人民首都命名的“北京号”。它是去年十一月九日载负着中国、中央两航空公司经理和数千员工的起义函电领先飞到人民祖国怀抱的“空中行宫”型巨型机，可载四十名旅客，有调节音响、气压等装备。当记者随同乘客们登机由广州起飞时，参加开航典礼的华南及广州各界代表都挥帽欢呼，热烈鼓掌，仪仗队奏起嘹亮的国歌。我们环飞一周向欢送者告别后，便升入八千五百公尺的高空，以每小时二百六十英里的速度向北飞行。依次越过珠江、长江、淮河和黄河四大流域，从山陵起伏的华南飞向华北无边的大平原。我们所穿过的祖国天空是美丽的，千奇百巧的朵朵白云，嵌在碧蓝的晴空中；俯瞰大地，则处处是青山翠谷，沃田阡陌；万千条河川像银丝的网交织在青山田野间。中午，我们同天津起航的飞机，先后降落在汉口机场。旅客们互相握手祝贺，欢迎的人群纷纷向飞机师献花，给飞机披彩、摄影，整整欢乐了两个多钟头。下午三时十分又起航飞津。六点十分到达天津机场时，天津市四万军民正热烈集会，庆祝“八一”建军节，并举行盛大的反对美帝国主义侵略台湾和朝鲜的示威游行。
    革命的中国人民，从来没有自己的空中交通工具。在解放战争取得全国的基本胜利以前，我们主要的交通工具是两只脚。在长期的艰难的日子里，革命的人民就凭双脚与拥有飞机、汽车、火车及一切交通工具的敌人作斗争。一九四八年，第四野战军进关作战的时候，还在山海关写下“胜利在脚上”的动员口号。现在，我们用敌人的汽车建立起自己的摩托化部队，用敌人的飞机建立起人民空军，铁路也由敌人手里解放出来，成了人民自己的铁路。而今天——光辉的建军节二十三周年的伟大节日，人民自己的民用航空事业也已开始通航了。
    中国人民的民用航空事业，在“八一”建军节正式开航，标帜着它将和中国人民解放军一样由小到大、由弱到强地逐渐成长。
    前途是无量的。民航工作人员应当作艰苦地努力。
