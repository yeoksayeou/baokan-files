Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 18th: The World Federation of Trade Unions has sent a cable to Malik, President of the United Nations Security Council, protesting against U.S. imperialism's bombing of the Korean people and protesting against the threat to use atomic bombs against Korea. The cable pointed out: "The bombing of peaceful Korean residents and the systematic destruction of cities and villages by American aircraft are acts of terror against civilians. As for the deliberate destruction of Korean national wealth by the US authorities and the US military in the territories controlled by the South Korean authorities and the US military, and the inhuman treatment of prisoners of war and political prisoners, it is a violation of the United Nations Charter and the most basic human rights."

The cable said: The constant threat of the US military to drop atomic bombs on the Korean people at any time constitutes a kind of mental oppression, which has aroused the public indignation of all mankind.

In the end, the World Federation of Trade Unions requested Chairman Malik in the cable to protect the Korean people, to prevent all bombings against them, and to prevent any threat of using atomic bombs.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 20th: The Polish News Agency reports: On the 17th, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Skrzeszewski sent a cable to the President of the Security Council, Malik, expressing deep indignation at the U.S. Air Force's indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities and villages in Korea. The cable pointed out: The U.S. intervention not only violated the United Nations Charter that it voluntarily signed, but also trampled on the rights of the peace-loving people of Korea. The Polish government earnestly hopes that Malik, in his capacity as President of the Security Council, will continue to make efforts to stop the criminal activities of the U.S. Air Force in Korea. The Polish government expresses its full support for the proposal put forward by the Soviet government for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

The Polish government also sent a similar telegram to the UN Secretary-General, Trygve Lie, in which it emphasized: "The UN Secretary-General has had and now has a duty to take steps to stop the criminal actions of the US Air Force."

    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：世界工联顷致电联合国安理会主席马立克，抗议美帝国主义轰炸朝鲜人民，并抗议对朝鲜使用原子弹的威胁。电文指出：“美国飞机轰炸朝鲜和平居民、有系统地毁灭城市和乡村，乃是针对平民的恐怖行动。至于在南朝鲜当局和美军所控制的领土上，美国故意破坏朝鲜国家财富，使战俘和政治犯受到非人的待遇，实属侵犯联合国宪章和最基本的人权。”
    电文说：关于美军随时会对朝鲜人民投掷原子弹一事的经常的威胁，形成一种精神上的压迫，已引起了全人类的公愤。
    世界工联最后在电文中请求马立克主席保护朝鲜民众，以防止对他们的一切轰炸，并防止关于会使用原子弹的任何威胁。

    波兰政府并以类似的电报一件致联合国秘书长赖伊，其中着重指出：“联合国秘书长过去和现在都有职责采取步骤，以制止美国空军的犯罪行动。”
