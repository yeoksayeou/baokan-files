　　A Congratulatory Speech by Guo Moruo, Head of the Chinese People's Delegation, at the Pyongyang Celebration of the Fifth Anniversary of the "August 15th" Korean Liberation

　　Today, as the heroic Korean people fight against the invading American imperialists and their lackeys for the independence, unification, freedom, and democracy of their motherland, achieving a great victory, and as we welcome the historical anniversary of the "August 15th" Korean Liberation, the Chinese people have sent us to express our greatest respect, with fraternal affection, to the 30 million hardworking and courageous Korean people, our greatest respect to the heroic and battle-tested Korean People's Army and all the guerrillas, and our greatest respect to General Kim Il-sung, the great leader of the Korean people!

　　The friendly relationship between the Chinese and Korean people is very close and long-standing, especially in the recent half-century, precisely during our generation. We grew up amidst the deep suffering of being invaded by imperialism. Our feelings and wills are closely connected, and our lives and actions are sometimes matters of life and death. It is no exaggeration to say that we are brothers and sisters in adversity, like flesh and blood.

　　Five years ago today, we rose from this long-term enslavement, long-term persecution, and long-term bitter struggle. We similarly rose with the help of a great fraternal country. This fraternal country, with its benevolent and powerful hand, helped us defeat Japanese imperialism, helped us break our shackles, and allowed us to stand up straight. Who is this fraternal country? Today's "August 15th" commemoration clearly tells us: this is our common and dearest friend, the strongest fortress of world peace—the Soviet Union.

　　Since the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has always been the dearest friend of our oppressed Eastern nations. Especially during World War II, the Soviet Union suffered the invasion of Hitler's Nazi Germany, underwent four years of patriotic war, and finally defeated Nazi Germany, liberating many fraternal countries in Europe. Then, it turned its forces eastward, defeating the Japanese imperialist’s most elite “Kwantung Army” of one million men, thereby liberating our Northeast and liberating Korea, and forcing Japanese imperialism to surrender. This ended our fate of being enslaved and devastated by Japanese imperialism for a long time. This great friendship, jointly experienced by the Chinese and Korean people five years ago, is still vividly present before our eyes, and all the experiences will vividly and forever be present before the eyes of our future generations.

　　Thus, five years ago, thanks to the joint efforts of the Chinese and Korean people, and with the help of the Soviet Union, we defeated Japanese imperialism. But today, we are again jointly subjected to the aggression of American imperialism. Since the end of World War II, American imperialism, which made a fortune in the war, seized the fruits of victory, replacing Nazi Germany in the West and inheriting Japanese imperialism in the East.

　　American imperialism refuses to accept historical lessons. In China, it fully supported the traitor Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out a civil war, and has already suffered a shameful and tragic defeat. In Korea, it instigated the traitor Syngman Rhee to embark on the same path as Chiang Kai-shek. But it still does not know how to repent. After "June 25th," it followed with "June 27th," actually taking action itself, openly carrying out armed aggression, invading Korea, invading our Taiwan, and preparing to carry out a comprehensive invasion of all Asian nations.

　　"June 27th" and "August 15th" form an excellent contrast. Who is the aggressor, who is the defender of peace, who is our common enemy, and who is our common friend? Isn't this as clear as fire?

　　But the American imperialist's crimes of aggression are today suffering the punishment they deserve. The American aggressors, like all their predecessors, made a wrong estimate of the war power: they overestimated their own strength and underestimated the strength of the Korean people. When they instigated the Syngman Rhee bandit army to launch the war on "June 25th," they thought that they could capture Pyongyang within three days. Who knew that, on the contrary, the Korean People's Army liberated Seoul in just three days. This forced American imperialism to personally step in, fully believing that the Korean people could be easily bullied, and that this opportunity could be used to show off their power and kill the chicken to scare the monkey. However, who knew that they would encounter a giant of steel! The American aggressors are conducting a war of aggression on the sacred land of Korea, and in just a month and a half, they have been defeated again and again, suffering losses and casualties, and are about to be completely driven into the sea by the Korean people. We sincerely thank the Korean people for this great victory. This is not only the victory of the Korean people, but also the common victory of the Chinese people and the Asian people who have been invaded, and the common victory of all progressive people around the world who love peace and democracy.

　　The facts are before us, and no one can deny them: a newly emerging Korea with a new democracy has defeated an America that dominates the world! This is not simply a question of power comparison, but also a question of system comparison. The contribution of this advantage to world peace is immeasurable.

　　Think about it, today the friendly unity of the socialist and new democratic countries, led by the Soviet Union, is incomparably strong. Coupled with the full awakening of the oppressed nations and the opposition to war by people all over the world, the friendly forces of the peace camp are so strong. On the side of the imperialist aggressive camp, the internal contradictions are becoming increasingly deep, and the contradictions between each other are also becoming increasingly deep. There are truly a hundred contradictions, appearing strong but inwardly weak. Imperialism itself is heading towards its end without remedy. Under such a comparison of situations, whoever dares to expand the war of aggression is digging their own grave!

　　We, the Chinese people, have the firm determination to liberate Taiwan and all Chinese territories, and we must support the movement of the oppressed nations in the East to strive for national independence. No matter how vicious and cruel the imperialists are, they cannot obstruct our iron will. Chairman Mao Zedong has already declared on behalf of all the Chinese people: "Asian affairs should be managed by the Asian people themselves." We believe that all Asian people will agree with this statement. We Asian oppressed nations, after centuries of enslavement and humiliation, are now awakening. The flames of the struggle for national independence are everywhere. The victory of the Chinese people is followed by the victory of the Korean people, and what follows in succession must be the victory of all other invaded people in Asia. Today, we also remember the Japanese people who are suffering under the tyranny and dictatorship of the American demon MacArthur. We believe that sooner or later, they will also make the American demon and its lackeys realize that what is under their feet is indeed a land full of volcanoes.

　　Glory belongs to the victorious heroic nation, the Korean people!

　　Eternal glory to the Korean people's heroes who sacrificed in the just war to drive out the American aggressors!

　　Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

　　Long live the ever-growing fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

　　Long live lasting world peace and the victory of people's democracy!

　　Long live General Kim Il-sung, the great leader of the Korean people!

　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the great revolutionary teacher and leader of the working people of the world!

　　祝贺朝鲜解放与抗美战争的胜利
    中国人民代表团团长郭沫若在平壤庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放五周年大会上的祝辞
    在英雄民族朝鲜人民为争取祖国的独立、统一、自由、民主，向侵略者美帝国主义同它的走狗作战，获得了伟大胜利的今天，迎接着“八、一五”朝鲜解放的历史纪念日，中国人民派遣了我们来，谨以兄弟的情谊，向三千万勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民致最大的敬礼，向英勇善战的朝鲜人民军和全体游击队员致最大的敬礼，向朝鲜人民伟大的领袖金日成将军致最大的敬礼！
    中朝两国人民的友爱关系是很密切很久远的，特别是在最近的半世纪，就正当着我们的这一代，我们是在同受帝国主义侵略的深沉的忧患中长大起来的，我们的感情、意志是痛痒相关，我们的生活、行动更有时是生死与共的。丝毫也不夸大：我们是骨肉手足一样的患难朋友。
    五年前的今天，我们是从这长期的奴役、长期的迫害、长期的恶战苦斗中，崛立起来了。我们是同样获得了一个伟大的兄弟之邦的帮助崛立起来了。这个兄弟之邦以仁慈的有力的巨手，帮助我们打败了日本帝国主义，帮助我们斩断了脚镣手铐，让我们挺起脊梁，站立了起来。这个兄弟之邦是谁呢？今天的“八、一五”纪念，便明朗的告诉我们：这就是我们共同的最亲爱的友邦，最坚强的世界和平堡垒——苏联。
    苏联自十月革命成功以来，一直是我们东方被压迫民族的最亲爱的朋友。特别是在第二次大战中，苏联遭受了希特勒纳粹德国的侵略，经历了四年的爱国战争，而终于击溃了纳粹德国，解放了欧洲的许多兄弟国家。然后又回师东向，击溃了日本帝国主义最精锐的一百万人的“关东军”，因而解放了我们的东北并解放了朝鲜，而迫使日本帝国主义投降了。这就终止了我们受日本帝国主义长期奴役、长期摧残的命运。这是五年前我们中朝两国人民所共同身受的伟大友谊，一切的经历都还活鲜鲜地呈现在我们的眼前，一切的经历也会活鲜鲜地永远呈现在我们的世世代代的子子孙孙的眼前的。
    就这样，在五年前由于我们中朝两国人民的共同努力，更得到苏联的帮助，我们打败了日本帝国主义，但在今天我们又共同受到美国帝国主义的侵略了。自从第二次大战结束以来，在战争中发了横财的美国帝国主义霸占了胜利的果实，在西方代替了纳粹德国，在东方继承了日本帝国主义。
    美帝国主义是不肯接受历史教训的，它在我们中国全力支持卖国贼蒋介石进行内战，已经遭受了可耻的悲惨的失败。在朝鲜又嗾使卖国贼李承晚走上和蒋介石同样的末路。但它还不知道悔悟，有了“六、二五”，再继之以“六、二七”，竟亲自动手，公开实行武装侵略，侵略朝鲜，侵略我们的台湾，更准备对全亚洲民族作全面性的侵略。
    “六、二七”和“八、一五”便形成了一个绝好的对照。到底谁是侵略国，谁是和平保卫者，谁是我们共同的敌人，谁是我们共同的友人，这不是明如观火的事吗？
    但是美帝国主义的侵略罪行在今天受着它应受的惩罚了。美国侵略者和它们的前辈一切侵略者们一样作出了战争力量的错误估计：它们过高地估计了自己的力量，过低地估计了朝鲜人民的力量。“六、二五”它们嗾使李承晚匪军发动战争的时候，以为三天之内便可以攻下平壤，谁知恰恰相反，仅仅三天工夫朝鲜人民军便光复了汉城。这就逼得美帝国主义不能不亲自出马，满以为朝鲜人民是可以轻侮的，可以借这个机会来耀武扬威，杀鸡给猴子看。然而，谁知道所碰到的却是钢铁的巨人！美国侵略者在朝鲜的神圣国土上进行侵略战争，还仅仅一个半月光景，一败再败，损兵折将，已经快被朝鲜人民完全驱逐下海里去了。朝鲜人民的这一伟大胜利，我们是由衷感谢的。这不仅是朝鲜人民的胜利，也是我们中国人民和亚洲被侵略人民的共同胜利，是全世界爱好和平民主的一切进步人民的共同胜利。
    事实摆在我们的面前，谁也无法否认：半个新民主主义的新起的朝鲜打败了一个在全世界称霸的美国！这不单纯是力量对比的问题，而同时是制度对比的问题。这一优劣的表现对于世界和平的贡献是无可计量的。
    请想想看，今天以苏联为首的社会主义和新民主主义国家的友爱团结是无比坚强的，加上被压迫民族的全面觉醒，全世界人民的反对战争，和平阵营的友军是这样雄厚。而在帝国主义侵略阵营一面，则内部的矛盾日益深刻化，彼此之间的矛盾也日益深刻化，真是矛盾百出，外强中干，帝国主义本身是无可挽救地走到了末路的。在这样的形势对比之下，谁要是敢于扩大侵略战争，谁就是自掘坟墓！
    我们中国人民有坚毅的决心，一定要解放台湾和中国全部的领土，一定要支持东方被压迫民族争取民族独立的运动。任何穷凶极恶的帝国主义者都阻挠不了我们这个钢铁的意志。毛泽东主席已经早已代表我们全中国人民声明：“亚洲的事务应该由亚洲人民自己来管。”我们相信：全亚洲人民都会同意这一声明的。我们亚洲被压迫民族在亘百年的奴役与屈辱的生活之下今天已经在觉醒了，四处都是民族独立斗争的烽火。中国人民胜利之后继之以朝鲜人民的胜利，接连而来的必然是全亚洲其他被侵略人民的胜利。在今天我们也怀念到在美国魔鬼麦克阿瑟的专制独裁之下受着蹂躏的日本人民。我们相信，他们也早迟会使美国魔鬼和它的走狗们体验到自己的脚下的确是一个遍地火山的国土。
    光荣属于胜利的英雄民族、朝鲜人民！
    在驱逐美国侵略者的正义战争中牺牲了的朝鲜人民英雄们永垂不朽！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    中朝两国人民与日俱进的兄弟友谊万岁！
    世界持久和平与人民民主胜利万岁！
    伟大的朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    伟大的革命导师、全世界劳动人民领袖斯大林大元帅万岁！
