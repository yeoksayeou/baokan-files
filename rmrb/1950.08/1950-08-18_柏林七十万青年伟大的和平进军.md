　　The great rally of 700,000 youths in Berlin in late May of this year was an unprecedented review of peace forces in Germany, and a powerful protest by German youths against the American, British, and French imperialists and warmongers. This great peace demonstration became one of the most important events in European political life at the time, attracting great attention.

　　I, along with five other comrades, was sent by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to participate in and congratulate them on this conference. At present, world peace is being seriously threatened by the aggressive camp headed by US imperialism, and Germany is a country that occupies an important position in Europe (as pointed out by Marshal Stalin, the Soviet and German peoples possess the greatest potential in Europe). Therefore, the struggle of the German people and German youth for the unity, peace, and democracy of their motherland has a major impact on peace in Europe and the world.

　　Germany is forcibly divided by the US, Britain, and France

　　The German imperialists of the past were the culprits behind the two world wars. After its defeat in the First World War, the imperialists of Britain, the United States, and France re-supported and armed it, and condoned the rise of Hitler's fascists, using them as vanguards to attack the Soviet Union and launch the Second World War. Although, after Germany's defeat, according to the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, Germany must follow the path of peaceful democracy in the future, fascism and militarism must be eradicated, democracy must be implemented, and a unified and peace-loving democratic new Germany must be established. However, only the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, while the imperialists of the United States, Britain, and France have tried their best to undermine the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, supporting the reactionary forces in Germany, and establishing the Bonn puppet regime in West Germany in September of the year before last, creating a split in Germany economically and politically. Their aim is to turn West Germany into their colony and use it as a base and bridgehead for launching a third world war to attack the Soviet Union, sacrificing the German people and re-manufacturing a great bloodbath in Europe. Precisely because Germany is a large country in Western Europe with a population of 70 million and a developed industry, coupled with decades of poisoning by militarism and Hitler's fascist anti-Soviet ideology, the imperialists of the United States, Britain, and France increasingly want to use the German people as cannon fodder for aggression against the Soviet Union.

　　However, the entire German people oppose the aggressive policy of the US, British, and French imperialists to split Germany. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party, they united around the National Front and established the German Democratic Republic in October of last year in order to safeguard German unity and independence. At that time, Marshal Stalin pointed out in his congratulatory telegram that the German Democratic Republic was an important factor in consolidating peace. He said: The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is "a turning point in European history." He pointed out: "The coexistence of a peace-loving democratic Germany and a peace-loving Soviet Union makes a new war impossible in Europe, ends the bloodshed in Europe, and makes it impossible for imperialism to enslave European countries."

　　Since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the struggle of the German people against the imperialist division of Germany, for unification and democracy, for the liberation of the entire German nation and for the defense of peace, has been rising and becoming more magnificent. On this basis, 700,000 young people from all over Germany gathered in Berlin for a great demonstration for unity and peace.

　　Seven hundred thousand youths roared: Unity! Peace! US imperialism get out!

　　This heroic action of the German youth began on May 27. Although the US, British, and French imperialists still occupy West Berlin, Berlin is, after all, the capital of the German Democratic Republic. Here, tens of thousands of young people from various provinces gathered to participate in the conference, including 25,000 patriotic youths from West Germany who had overcome various difficulties and obstacles. The gathering of Eastern and Western youths is, in itself, a powerful denial and protest against the US imperialist forced division of Germany. When we arrived in Berlin, we found young people crowded everywhere on the streets of Berlin, which were full of the ravages of war. Everywhere were flags, slogans, cheers, and songs. Most of the young people were wearing the uniforms of the "Free German Youth League" - blue shirts, plus countless blue league flags with a rising sun. Berlin had become a blue city. In the blue, there were the black, red, and golden tricolor flag of the German Democratic Republic, which is rich in German historical symbolism, the flag of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the flags of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries. Everywhere we heard the cheers of "Friendship" - this is the "League Salute" when people from the "Free German Youth League" meet. This is a slogan full of internationalist spirit, because in the past, Hitler used the spirit of national hatred to poison German youth.

　　The international youth representatives who came to congratulate included World Federation of Democratic Youth President Paulson (French), World Student Union President Grossman (Czech), delegations from the Soviet Communist Youth League, China, and various people's democratic countries. In addition, there were democratic youth representatives from more than 20 countries, including the United States, Britain, France, and Italy. The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary also sent many cultural and sports teams, including the most outstanding athletes, such as the Czech Chatope, who set the world record for long-distance running. The famous Soviet writer Ehrenburg also rushed to participate in this youth festival.

　　The first item on the official agenda was to lay flowers at the Soviet Red Army Martyrs Memorial Tower. The faces of the German youths who laid the flowers were solemn and heavy. They understood how these great sacrificers used their lives to defend the future of mankind; how they made it possible for German youths to obtain the possibility of creating a happy future from the clutches of fascist beasts. On the afternoon of May 27, a congress of 7,000 youth peace defenders was held. The appearance of German people's leaders, President Pieck of the Socialist Unity Party, and Grotewohl and Ulbricht, won long-lasting cheers. West German Communist leader Max Reimann, who persisted in the struggle in the US, British, and French occupied areas, constantly exposing and opposing the imperialist conspiracy of aggression, was warmly welcomed by the youth. The presidents of the World Youth Federation and the World Student Union, and representatives from the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries all spoke, expressing unlimited respect and inspiration for the rapid and great progress made by German youth under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party and President Pieck. The meeting severely criticized the war attempts and divisive conspiracies of the US, British, and French imperialists, passed the German Youth Rights Bill, and severely criticized the crimes of the US, British, and French imperialists in corrupting and poisoning West German youth and suppressing democracy. The congress sent a telegram to Stalin, paying tribute to him and telling him that German youth would never be cannon fodder for attacking the Soviet Union.

　　The peace march of 700,000 youths on May 28 was an unprecedented review of peace forces in German history, and a great demonstration that made the warmongers feel uneasy. The original plan was for 500,000 people to participate, but the actual number of participants reached 700,000. The marching队伍队伍, with a width of dozens of people per row, started at 8:00 in the morning and lasted until 5:00 in the afternoon, a total of nine hours before it ended.

　　President Pieck spoke before the youth队伍队伍 started marching. Before the march, a large group of doves symbolizing peace were released. The marching youths roared "Oppose the warmongers!" "Germany must be united and democratic!" "American occupation troops get out!" "German youth will not be cannon fodder for attacking the Soviet Union!"

　　The flags of the Soviet Union, China, and Germany, and portraits of people's leaders from various countries, appeared from time to time in the marching队伍队伍. The youth all shouted: "Long live Stalin!" "Learn from the Soviet Communist Youth League!" "Long live German-Soviet friendship!" When the youth walked past the rostrum, they saw the respected President Pieck, who was seventy-four years old with white hair, waving and applauding to the masses, and next to him stood youth representatives and party and government leaders from various countries. Everyone was even more excited, they cheered, applauded, sang, threw flowers up, and waved flags. Some people were so excited that they shed tears. It rained heavily five or six times this day, but the队伍队伍 was so orderly and excited. President Pieck kept smiling and waving to the marching队伍队伍. He stood for nine hours, truly amazing health and perseverance!

　　The third day was the democratic sports meet. The stadium was very close to the western occupied area, and it was very large, accommodating 80,000 people to sit and watch. It was built by the youth through voluntary labor for this conference. This stadium was named after the leader beloved by the youth - Ulbricht. The program of the sports meet fully expressed the combination of the requirements of peaceful unity and sports. The characteristic of the mass gymnastics was the large scale and the rapid and orderly movements.

　　At the same time, Berlin also held a large camp for 20,000 Young Pioneers, a model airplane exhibition, various cultural and sports performances, and the most extensive street propaganda.

　　From the moving, heroic, and enthusiastic actions of the German youth, it can be clearly seen: the German youth who have suffered from fascist poisoning have made amazing progress. This progress is: liberating themselves from the poisoning of anti-Soviet and anti-people ideas, and transforming into loving the people and loving the Soviet Union; transforming from the fascist reactionary racial theory to internationalism; transforming from the victims of warmongers to active supporters of peace. Regardless of whether the US, British, and French imperialists continue to oppress and poison West German youth, and want to use them as cannon fodder, the consciousness of West German youth is rapidly improving, and heroic resistance actions are also increasing day by day. The West German peace signature campaign, no matter how the reactionary authorities suppress it, has still received extremely wide support from the people. This great demonstration in Berlin will inevitably expand and strengthen the mass movement against the US, British, and French imperialist occupiers that has already been set off in West Germany. This heroic act of the brave German youth has greatly strengthened the power of the people and youth of the world to defend peace and oppose aggression.

　　The people support the democratic republic

　　The victory of the German youth is not accidental. In the victory of this great peace march, first of all, it demonstrates the victory of the correct leadership of the German Democratic Republic government and the Socialist Unity Party. They have won the warm support of the people. Because the Socialist Unity Party, with the help of the Soviet Union, mobilized and educated the masses to resolutely implement the principles of the Potsdam Agreement. Since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, it has insisted on making the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement its own task. Therefore, over the years, it has eradicated fascism and militarism, universally implemented land reform, eliminated the land ownership of the Junker landlords who were the basis of militarism, implemented the nationalization of major enterprises and the confiscation of the property of war criminals and important fascists, given the people democratic rights, and restored and developed a peaceful economy. Therefore, by this year, the peaceful economy in the territory of the democratic republic has basically reached the pre-war level, prices have been lowered for the fifth time, and unemployment has been completely eliminated. This is completely different from the situation in the western US, British, and French occupied areas, where war criminals and fascists are rampant, the economy is increasingly colonized, unemployment is serious (there are 300,000 unemployed in West Berlin alone), and reactionary war cries are full! This is the basic reason why the people and youth support the Socialist Unity Party and the government of the democratic republic. Therefore, West German youth come to Berlin to participate in the great demonstration, regardless of the dangers and threats from the reactionaries. And many young people's parents also came to Berlin to participate in the demonstration. Residents of the Soviet-occupied area of Berlin vacated their houses to receive young guests from all over the country who came to participate in the parade.

　　The Soviet Union's enthusiastic help

　　Secondly, the All-German Youth Conference also marks the great victory of the Soviet Union's friendly policy towards Germany based on internationalist principles. The Soviet Union's victory in the Second World War led to the demise of German fascism and liberated the German people. At successive international conferences, the Soviet Union insisted that Germany should become a unified, peaceful, and democratic country. The Soviet occupation forces are the faithful executors of the Potsdam Agreement. After the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet occupation forces handed over administrative power and many other rights to the government of the democratic republic. This is also a stark contrast to the US, British, and French policies of enslaving Germany. Before this All-German Youth Conference, on May 15, Marshal Stalin, at the request of the German Democratic Republic and with the consent of the government of the Polish Republic, decided to reduce the remaining reparations owed by Germany by half and allowed them to be paid off in installments over fifteen years. This can greatly help the German people restore and develop their national economy. The US, British, and French governments have not yet proposed how much reparations they want, because they want to take anything from Germany without limitation. What especially aroused the excitement and encouragement of German youth was that Stalin personally sent a return telegram to the Youth Peace Defender Congress to congratulate the German youth on their victory in the struggle for unity, peace, and democracy. Stalin's cordial caress for German youth is fully expressed in this telegram. The Soviet Union's enthusiastic help and Stalin's telegram accelerated the speed of German youth's awakening, and Stalin's name became increasingly intimate to German youth.

　　The solidarity of fraternal countries' youth internationalism

　　Thirdly, the democratic youth of the world showed unlimited enthusiasm for the new partner who joined the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union - the German democratic youth. Whether it was the Soviet youth or the youth of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other countries who had been enslaved by Hitler in the past, they unanimously expressed their love and solidarity for the German democratic youth. The national hatred deliberately created by the long-term reactionary rule of the imperialists has all dissolved in the face of brilliant internationalism. Everyone encouraged the German youth to move forward more bravely, and everyone joined hands to stop the large-scale slaughter actively manufactured by the US imperialists. In particular, the third executive committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth was held in Berlin immediately after the German Youth Conference, which gave the German youth great encouragement. Because this means that Berlin, the most important breeding ground for European imperialist wars, has become a bastion of peace!

　　The despicable and shameless sabotage tricks of the imperialists and West German puppets

　　Fourthly, the US, British, and French imperialists and the West German puppet government carried out all kinds of despicable and shameless sabotage against the Berlin Youth Peace Demonstration, which further exposed their faces as enemies of the German people and peace and democracy. As early as a few months ago, they announced in news telegrams that they would use machine guns and tanks to deal with unarmed youths, and threatened parents not to let their children go to Berlin. They deployed a policeman every twenty yards at the main intersections between the western occupied areas and the democratic republic. They distributed oranges to young people in West Berlin, persuading them not to come to the east. On the day of the German youth parade, the US, British, and French imperialists prepared tanks, armored vehicles, machine guns, and tear gas, and used a helicopter to patrol the skies over Berlin, and also used some unmarked planes to fly over the marching队伍队伍. After all this completely failed, they surrounded more than 10,000 West German youths returning from the parade in the western area, saying that they wanted to "check their health" and persuaded them to go to the medical clinic that "administered typhoid shots" - which was actually a concentration camp. The youth refused these shameless deceptions, and the police and gendarmes beat the youth and broke the spine of a twelve-year-old child. In addition, the reactionary news pawns did their best to create unfounded rumors. A Dutch newspaper announced that there was a bloody conflict in Berlin, and American news said that the parade had been dispersed by heavy rain, leaving only an American plane in the sky. These reporters even arranged in advance to take photos of the chaos during the parade. The result of all these shameless acts was tragic. The head of Reuters in Berlin was so moved by the contrast between these shameless acts and the enthusiasm of the German youth that he announced that he was leaving the rumor-mongering news agency he served and staying in Germany. Here is another episode: A shameless West German reporter even asked us at a press conference in a provocative and sarcastic tone: "Do Chinese youths also walk around in the streets like German youths in order to defend peace?" He attempted to ridicule the solemn and great peace parade as a boring act of walking around in the streets, but we told him: "Chinese youth have adopted various ways to express their will in order to defend peace. But unfortunately, this freedom is completely absent in West Germany." Faced with this answer, this shameless "warrior" was met with laughter from the entire audience.

　　Deep Sino-German New Friendship

　　Finally, the friendship between Chinese and German democratic youth is developing and consolidating on the basis of jointly defending world peace and building a peaceful and democratic new life.

　　Our Chinese youth delegation received an extremely warm welcome as soon as we entered German territory from the Czech Republic by train. On the 200-kilometer car journey from the southern border to Berlin, every time we arrived in a city, they had already convened a mass meeting or a youth mass meeting, where we gave speeches. We gave five speeches in half a day. Along the way, every short distance was lined with teachers leading young league members and Young Pioneers waiting to welcome us. Before we arrived in Berlin, Comrade Horek, Secretary-General of the Free German Youth League, personally greeted us at the border of Greater Berlin. Amidst the national anthems of China and Germany, we reviewed the队伍队伍 of the German People's Police. The car we were riding in was always surrounded by the队伍队伍 of youth, offering flowers, shaking hands, cheering, and even lifting us up. In the队伍队伍 of the 700,000-person parade, not only did Chairman Mao's portraits often appear, but one队伍队伍 had hundreds of Chairman Mao's portraits appearing at the same time. In the camp of the 20,000 Young Pioneers, there was a squad named the "Mao Zedong Squad". There were long slogans written in Chinese in front of the door of our residence, and portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu inside the room. Berlin bookstores have published many kinds of books introducing the Chinese revolutionary struggle. Newspaper reporters requested answers about the experience and heroic deeds of Chinese youth participating in the revolutionary struggle.

　　The gifts we brought to the German youth this time were a banner embroidered with "Unite in the Peace Camp Headed by the Soviet Union and Strive for Lasting Peace with Action!" and the film "The Birth of New China". In addition, there were Chinese translations of the most outstanding spiritual heritage of Germany, such as Marx, Engels, Goethe, Heine, and Klopstock. We also sent them a set of uniforms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Our gifts were extremely warmly welcomed by them. The German youth gave us so many gifts: there were felt blankets woven with Chairman Mao's portrait, various flags, books, and many factory youths gave us their own products. The youth of the Ibi River Shipyard gave us a model of a ship, and the youth of the sewing machine and electric drill factory gave us sewing machines and electric drills. They hoped and were willing to help us build our country into an industrial country faster and strengthen economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. The students gave us their school's painting albums and handicrafts. They all believe that the victory of the Chinese people and the contribution of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance to world peace are of great significance. They repeatedly urged us: be sure to bring the sincere friendship of the German youth to the Chinese youth. Yes, from Beijing to Berlin, our hearts have been closely linked together.

　　How great has been the progress of German youth in the short five years after the war! Their faces have completely changed. The truth of the people's peaceful democracy has also achieved such a brilliant victory in Germany - a land so deeply poisoned by fascism. This most powerfully proves that this truth will be victorious wherever it goes. It also proves: what a change has taken place in the world, and what a development has taken place in the forces of peace and democracy.

　　柏林七十万青年伟大的和平进军
    参加德国青年大会中国青年代表团团长  许立群
    今年五月底在柏林举行的全德七十万青年的大会，是全德和平力量空前的大检阅，也是德国青年向美英法帝国主义者和战争贩子们的有力抗议。这一伟大的和平示威，成为当时欧洲政治生活中引起极大注意的重要事件之一。
    我曾经和另外五位同志被中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会派去参加与祝贺他们的这一次大会。目前世界和平正受到以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营的严重威胁，而德国在欧洲是居于重要地位的国家（正如斯大林大元帅所指出的，在欧洲，苏联和德国两国人民是拥有最大的潜力的）。因此，德国人民和德国青年为了他们祖国的统一与和平民主而进行的斗争，对于欧洲与世界的和平有着重大影响的。
    德国被美英法所强迫分裂
    过去的德国帝国主义者是两次世界大战的祸首。它在第一次大战失败之后，英美法等帝国主义者重行扶植与武装了它，并纵容希特勒法西斯登台，用做进攻苏联的先锋，发动了第二次世界大战。虽然，在德国战败之后，根据波茨坦协定的规定，今后德国必须遵循着和平民主的道路发展，必须根绝法西斯主义和军国主义，实行民主，建立一个统一与爱好和平的民主的新德国。但是只有苏联始终不渝地遵守波茨坦协定的原则，而美英法帝国主义者却竭力破坏了波茨坦协定的原则，扶植德国的反动势力，并在前年九月间成立了西德的波恩傀儡政权，从经济上、政治上造成了对德国的分裂。他们的企图是把西德变成他们的殖民地，并作为发动第三次世界大战进攻苏联的基地和桥头堡垒，牺牲德国人民，重新制造欧洲的大流血。正因为德国是西欧拥有七千万人口的大国，有着发达的工业，再加上几十年来受着军国主义和希特勒法西斯反苏思想的毒害，美英法帝国主义就愈益想把德国人民作为侵略苏联的炮灰。
    但是，全德人民反对美英法帝国主义者分裂德国的侵略政策。他们在统一社会党领导下，团结在全国阵线的周围，为了维护德意志的统一和独立，在去年十月建立了德意志民主共和国。当时，斯大林大元帅曾在贺电中指出了德意志民主共和国是巩固和平的重要因素。他说：德意志民主共和国的成立是“欧洲历史的转折点”。他指出：“爱好和平的民主德国与爱好和平的苏联之并肩存在，使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，结束欧洲的流血，并使帝国主义奴役欧洲国家成为不可能。”
    德意志民主共和国成立以来，德国人民反对帝国主义分裂德国、争取统一民主、争取整个德国民族解放与保卫和平的斗争，就日益高涨，日益波澜壮阔了。在这一基础上，全德七十万青年会合在柏林，举行了争取统一、和平的大示威。
    七十万青年怒吼着：统一！和平！美帝国主义滚出去！
    全德青年这一英雄行动，从五月二十七日开始。虽然美英法帝国主义者还盘踞在柏林西部，但柏林终究是德意志民主共和国的首都。在这里，汇集了各省赶来参加大会的几十万青年，其中包括着冲破种种艰难险阻而来的两万五千西部德国的爱国青年。东部和西部青年会合在一起，这件事的本身，就是对美帝国主义强迫分裂德国的有力的否认和抗议。我们到达柏林时，就发现在满目兵燹的柏林街头上，到处拥挤着青年，到处是旗帜、标语、欢呼和歌声。青年们大多数穿着“自由德国青年团”的制服——蓝色的衬衣，再加上无数的带着初升太阳的蓝色的团旗，柏林成了蓝色的城市了。在蓝色中间，就是富有德国历史象征意义的黑、红与金黄三色的德意志民主共和国国旗，世界民主青年联盟的盟旗，苏联、中国和人民民主国家的国旗。到处都听到“友谊”的欢呼——这是“自由德国青年团”的人们见面时的“团礼”。这是一个充满国际主义精神的口号，因为过去希特勒正是以民族仇恨的精神来毒害德国青年的。
    来参加庆贺的国际青年代表有世界民主青年联盟主席鲍尔逊（法国人），世界学联主席格罗曼（捷克人），苏联共产主义青年团的代表团，中国和各人民民主国家的代表团。此外还有美英法意等国，总共二十余国的民主青年代表。苏联、捷克、匈牙利，还派去了人数很多的文工团与体育队，其中包括最杰出的运动家，如捷克的创造世界长跑纪录的查多贝。苏联著名作家爱伦堡也赶来参加这青年们的盛会。
    正式日程的第一项是向苏联红军烈士纪念塔献花。献花的德国青年面容是沉痛庄严的，他们懂得这些伟大的牺牲者，怎样用他们的生命保卫了人类的将来；怎样使德国青年从法西斯野兽的魔爪下获得了创造幸福前途的可能性。五月二十七日下午举行了七千人的青年和平保卫者代表大会，德国人民领袖统一社会党的主席皮克总统和格罗提渥、乌布利希的出现，赢得了长时间的欢呼。在美英法占领区坚持斗争，不断揭露与反对帝国主义侵略阴谋的西德共产党领袖马克思·雷曼，受到青年极热烈的欢迎。世界青联主席、世界学联主席和苏中波捷等国代表都讲了话，一致对德国青年在统一社会党和皮克总统领导下所获得的迅速而巨大的进步，表示无限的敬意和感奋。会议痛斥了美英法帝国主义的战争企图与分裂阴谋，通过了德国青年权利法案，痛斥了美英法帝国主义者腐化与毒化西德青年和压制民主的罪行。大会通电向斯大林致敬，告诉他德国青年决不充当进攻苏联的炮灰。
    五月二十八日举行的七十万青年和平游行，是德国历史上空前的一次和平力量的大检阅，也是使得战争贩子惶然不安的一次大示威。原计划参加者五十万人，但实际参加者竟达到七十万人。游行的队伍以几十人一排的宽度从早晨八时开始一直到下午五点钟，一共九小时才结束。
    青年队伍游行开始前，皮克总统讲了话。游行之前，放出了大群象征和平的鸽子。游行的青年们怒吼着“反对战争贩子！”“德国必须统一、民主！”“美国占领军滚回去！”“德国青年不做进攻苏联的炮灰！”
    苏联、中国、德国的国旗和各国的人民领袖像，不时在游行队伍中出现。青年都高喊着：“斯大林万岁！”“向苏联共产主义青年团学习！”“德苏友谊万岁！”当青年们走过主席台前的时候，他们看见敬爱的发眉皆白的七十四岁的皮克总统在向群众挥手、鼓掌，而他的旁边还立着各国青年代表和党政领袖，大家更兴奋了，他们欢呼、鼓掌、唱歌、把花朵扔上去，挥动着旗帜。有的人兴奋得流下泪来。这一天落过五六次大雨，可是队伍却是那么整齐和兴奋。皮克总统一直微笑着向游行队伍招手，他一直站了九小时，真是惊人的健康和毅力！
    第三天是民主体育大会。运动场距离西部占领区很近，规模很大，可容八万人坐下参观。这是青年们为了这次大会而用义务劳动修建起来的。这个运动场被命名为青年所热爱的领导者——乌布利希。体育大会的节目充分表现出和平统一的要求和体育运动结合起来了。集体操的特点是规模大、动作迅速整齐。
    与此同时，在柏林还举行了两万少先队员的大露营，飞机模型展览会，各种文艺体育表演，还有最广泛的街头宣传。
    从德国青年令人感动的英勇热烈的行动中，可以清楚地看到：遭受法西斯毒害的德国青年，已经有了怎样惊人的进步。这一进步是：从被反苏反人民思想的毒害中解放出来，转变到热爱人民热爱苏联；从法西斯的反动人种论转变到国际主义；从战争贩子的牺牲品变为和平的积极拥护者。不管美英法帝国主义者继续在压迫与毒化西德青年，要把他们当作炮灰，但是西德青年们的觉悟正在迅速提高，英勇的反抗行动，也在日益增强。西德和平签名运动，不管反动当局如何压迫，仍然得到了人民极广泛的支持。这一次柏林的大示威必然会使西德已经掀起的反对美英法帝国主义占领者的群众运动更加扩大和加强起来。英勇的德国青年的这一英雄行为，已经大大加强全世界人民和青年保卫和平反对侵略的力量了。
    人民都拥护民主共和国
    德国青年的胜利不是偶然的。在这一伟大的和平进军的胜利中，首先，它表现了德意志民主共和国政府和统一社会党正确领导的胜利。他们获得了人民热烈的拥戴。因为统一社会党，在苏联的帮助下，发动与教育群众坚决执行了波茨坦协定的方针。而德意志民主共和国成立以来，更坚持以实现波茨坦协定为自己的任务。因此，几年来根绝了法西斯与军国主义，普遍实行了土地改革，消灭军国主义基础的容克大地主的土地所有制，实行了主要企业国有化和没收战犯与法西斯重要分子的财产，给人民以民主权利，恢复发展和平经济。因此到本年为止，民主共和国辖境内和平经济在基本上达到战前的水平，物价已经第五次降低，失业现象已完全消灭。这和西部美英法占领区战犯和法西斯横行，经济日益殖民地化，失业严重（仅西部柏林即有三十万人失业），充满了反动派战争叫嚣的情况，完全不同！这是人民和青年所以拥护统一社会党、拥护民主共和国政府的基本理由。因此，西德青年们不避险阻、不怕反动派的威胁恫吓来参加柏林的大示威。而且许多青年的父母们也都来到柏林参加示威。柏林苏占区的居民，每家都腾出房屋，招待各地来参加游行的青年客人。
    苏联的热情帮助
    其次，全德青年大会也标志着苏联在国际主义原则上的对德友好政策的伟大胜利。苏联在第二次大战中的胜利，使德国法西斯归于灭亡，使德国人民获得了解放。在历次国际会议中，苏联坚持德国应该成为统一、和平、民主的国家。苏联占领军是波茨坦协定的忠实执行者。在德意志民主共和国成立之后，苏联占领军已把行政权及其它许多权利交给了民主共和国政府。这和美英法奴役德国的政策也成为鲜明的对比。在这次全德青年大会之前的五月十五日，斯大林大元帅根据德意志民主共和国的请求，并征得波兰共和国政府的同意，决定将德国剩余的赔款减少一半，并允许可以延期十五年还清。这就可以大大帮助德国人民恢复和发展他们的国民经济。而美英法政府却至今没有提出究竟要多少赔款，因为他们要无限制地从德国拿走任何东西。尤其引起德国青年兴奋鼓舞的，是斯大林亲自给德国青年和平保卫者代表大会的致敬电以一个复电，祝贺德国青年在争取统一、和平民主斗争中获得胜利。斯大林对德国青年的亲切爱抚，从这一封电报中完全表现出来了。苏联的热情帮助和斯大林的电报，更加快了德国青年的觉悟速度，斯大林的名字对德国青年日益变得亲切无比了。
    兄弟国家青年国际主义的团结
    其三，全世界民主青年对于加入了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营来的新伙伴——德国民主青年表现了无限的热情。不管是苏联青年或是过去被希特勒奴役过的波、捷、匈等各国青年，一致表示了对德国民主青年的热爱和团结。帝国主义者长期反动统治故意制造的民族仇恨，在光辉的国际主义面前全都消解了。大家都鼓励德国青年更英勇地前进，大家携起手来制止美帝国主义者积极制造的大屠杀。尤其是世界民主青年联盟第三次执委会紧接着德国青年大会在柏林召开，更给了德国青年以很大的鼓舞。因为这表示着，柏林这一欧洲帝国主义战争的最重要的策源地，已经变成和平的堡垒了！
    帝国主义者和西德傀儡们卑劣无耻的破坏伎俩
    其四，美英法帝国主义者和西德傀儡政府对柏林青年和平示威进行了种种卑劣无耻的破坏，更暴露了他们是德国人民与和平民主的敌人的面目。他们早在几个月以前就在新闻电讯中宣布要用机枪和坦克来对付手无寸铁的青年，恫吓家长们不要让青年到柏林去。他们在西部占领区与民主共和国交界的要道口每二十码布置一名警察。他们在柏林西部分发蜜橘给青年，劝诱他们不要到东面来。在德国青年大游行的那一天，美英法帝国主义者准备好了坦克，装甲车，机关枪和催泪弹，又用一架直升飞机在柏林上空巡回，还用一些没有标志的飞机飞过游行队伍的上空。在这一切都完全失败了之后，在西部地区包围了一万多参加游行归去的西德青年，说是要“检查健康”，劝他们到“打伤寒预防针”的医务所——实际是集中营去。青年拒绝这些无耻的欺骗，警察和宪兵便殴打青年，并且把一个十二岁小孩的脊骨打断了。此外，反动的新闻走卒尽量制造毫无根据的谣言。荷兰报纸宣布柏林发生流血冲突，美国新闻说游行已被大雨冲散，只剩了一架美国飞机留在天上。这些记者甚至预先布置要拍摄游行发生混乱的照片。这一切的无耻行径结果是悲惨的，路透社在柏林的负责人便因为被这些无耻行为和德国青年热情的对比所感动，宣布脱离他所服务的造谣通讯社而留居德国。这里还有一个插曲：有一位厚颜无耻的西德记者，在记者招待会上竟用挑衅和讽刺的口吻问我们说：“中国青年为了保卫和平，是否也如德国青年一样地到街上走来走去？”他企图讥讽青年庄严伟大的和平游行是一种在街上走来走去的无聊行动，但是我们告诉他：“中国青年为了保卫和平，采取了各种方式表示出自己的意志。但可惜这一自由在西德却完全没有。”在这一回答面前，这位无耻的“勇士”遭到了全体哄堂的讪笑。
    深厚的中德新友谊
    最后，中德民主青年的友谊，在共同保卫世界和平与建设和平民主新生活的基础上，是日益发展和巩固起来了。
    我们中国青年代表团乘火车从捷克一进入德国国境，就受到极热烈的欢迎。从南部边境到柏林的二百公里左右的汽车旅途中，我们每到一个城市，他们就已经召集了群众或青年群众的大会，由我们讲演，半天之内就讲演了五次。沿途许多里的路程中，每隔很短距离，就有教员带领青年团员少先队员们排在路旁等待着欢迎。我们到柏林之前，自由德国青年团总书记荷列克同志到大柏林边界亲自迎接。在中德两国国歌声中，我们检阅了德国人民警察的队伍。我们乘坐的汽车随时会被青年的队伍所包围，献花，握手，欢呼，甚至于把我们抬起来。在七十万人游行的队伍中不只常常有毛主席画像出现，而且其中有一支队伍有好几百个毛主席画像同时出现。在两万少先队员大露营的营地中，有被命名为“毛泽东队”的小队。在我们的住处门前有很长的中文写的标语，室内有毛主席朱总司令的挂像。柏林书店里出版了好多种介绍中国革命斗争的书籍。报纸记者要求解答关于中国青年参加革命斗争的经验和英勇事迹。
    我们这次带给德国青年的礼物是绣着“团结在以苏联为首的和平阵营里，用行动来争取持久的和平！”的旗帜，和《新中国的诞生》的电影，此外还有马克思，恩格斯，歌德，海涅，克洛维支等德国最优秀的精神遗产的中文译本。我们还送了他们一套中国人民解放军的军服。我们的礼品，受到他们极热烈的欢迎。德国青年送给我们的礼物真是多得很：有织了毛主席像的毡子，各种旗帜，书籍，许多工厂青年把他们自己的生产品送给我们，易比河造船厂青年送我们一艘轮船模型，缝纫机和电钻工厂的青年送我们缝纫机和电钻。他们希望并愿意帮助我们更快地建设我们的国家成为工业国，加强两国经济文化的合作。学生送给我们他们学校的画册，手工艺艺术品。他们对中国人民的胜利以及中苏友好同盟互助条约对世界和平的贡献，都认为有极伟大的意义。他们一再嘱咐我们：一定要把德国青年的真诚友谊带给中国青年。是的，从北京到柏林，我们的心已紧紧地联结在一起了。
    在战后短期的五年当中，德国青年的进步是如何巨大！他们的面貌完全改变了。人民的和平民主的真理，在德国——这一个遭受法西斯毒害如此深重的土地上，也获得了这样光辉的胜利，这就最有力地证明了这一真理将无往而不胜利。它也证明了：世界面貌有了怎样的转变，和平民主力量有了怎样的发展。
