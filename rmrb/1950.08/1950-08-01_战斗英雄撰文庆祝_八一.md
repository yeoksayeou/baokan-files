　　Combat Heroes Write Articles to Celebrate "August 1st"
　　I will resolutely use the spirit of the Wazijie battle to defend the motherland
　　First Field Army Combat Hero Liu Sihu

　　Editor's note: Liu Sihu was one of the most outstanding combat heroes in the Yichuan Campaign. In the Yichuan Campaign of 1948, our army annihilated more than 30,000 enemy troops, which greatly shocked the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army camp and completely changed the situation on the Northwest battlefield. In the battle of Wazijie in Yichuan, he stabbed seven enemies to death or injury in a row. When he was wounded in eleven places and the medics came to carry him, he refused, saying, "I don't need to be carried. You go ahead and carry the other wounded comrades." Now Liu Sihu's story has been adapted into a play, and the movement to learn from Liu Sihu has been widely launched in the Northwest Military Region.

　　My name is Liu Sihu, and I am from Fengzhen, Suiyuan. My family used to be very poor, and I suffered as an apprentice from a young age. My father was a plasterer who was forced to hang himself by the landlord. Poor people had no way to survive in the old society. In 1946, I voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army and have now become a glorious Communist Party member and deputy company commander. I am currently working in the 1st Regiment of the 1st Army of the People's Liberation Army. It was the Communist Party that saved me and cultivated me, so on this 23rd anniversary of the founding of our army, and at a time when the whole country is enthusiastically launching a movement to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, I would like to say something from my heart as a gift to commemorate this day.

　　I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, tempered in the flames of war. I have sworn to be a glorious soldier of the People's National Defense Forces for life. In the past, these war bandits, the U.S. imperialists, helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to massacre the Chinese people and were driven out of mainland China by our Chinese people. Now, on the one hand, they continue to invade our country's Taiwan, and on the other hand, they support the Korean puppet government of Syngman Rhee in provoking a civil war in Korea, but they have been beaten to a pulp by the Korean People's Army, with U.S. troops being killed, wounded, and captured in batches. Many American soldiers were so frightened that they developed "shock sickness." Facts have proven that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger that can be punctured with one poke, and the power of the world's peace-loving people is incomparably strong. I now solemnly warn the U.S. imperialists: The thousands upon thousands of peace-loving people in the world, led by the Soviet Union, resolutely oppose war, but are not afraid of war; we absolutely uphold peace, but we are not begging imperialism for peace. Today, I first swear: I am willing to continue to display the courage I showed in the Wazijie battle to annihilate the enemy, when I charged into the enemy ranks alone and stabbed seven enemies to death or injury in a row, to liberate our country's territory of Taiwan and Tibet, and to defend world peace. When necessary, I will dedicate my life. I will also closely unite with my comrades-in-arms, work hard in production, and study hard to support the fraternal units and defeat the invading troops of U.S. imperialism.

　　We want to liberate Tibet and Taiwan, we are not afraid of American devils!
　　First Field Army Combat Hero Zhou Heizi

　　Editor's note: Combat hero Zhou Heizi has demonstrated courage and wisdom in previous battles, and is good at leading soldiers ideologically, bringing into play the power of the masses, and creating mass bravery. For example, in the Binxian battle in 1948, he led his entire squad to defeat more enemies than themselves, eliminating an enemy command post without any casualties on his own side.

　　We live in Qinghai, the source of the Yellow River. In order to liberate Tibet as soon as possible, we are responsible for building the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. When we saw in the newspapers U.S. imperialist Truman's statement on June 27, declaring the dispatch of troops to attack Korea, invading our country's Taiwan, and interfering in Vietnam and the Philippines, we were so angry that our eyes were blazing. We unanimously demanded that our superiors quickly issue orders to attack Taiwan and bury the American devils and Chiang Kai-shek in the sea in one fell swoop. The Chinese People's Liberation Army defeated the Japanese devils in the past, and in the three years of the Liberation War, it annihilated the Chiang bandit army on the mainland. Can't we liberate Taiwan and Tibet, these small places?

　　Now, in order to liberate Tibet, I am determined to complete the task of building the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. Although we have completed all the engineering east of Mount O'la in the severe cold climate of minus eighteen degrees Celsius; we have built a roadbed on the "panjiangdi" that "cannot be washed away by water and cannot be crushed by vehicles," and it will soon be open to traffic.

　　We resolutely oppose the U.S. devil soldiers' invasion of the Korean people. We are resolutely willing to support the Korean People's Army and wipe them out!

　　A Warning to American Aggressors
　　Third Field Army Combat Hero Wei Laiguo

　　Editor's note: Wei Laiguo is an outstanding marksman. Born into a poor peasant family. In the Nanquan ambush battle in Shandong in 1946, he repelled the attack of an enemy column with his accurate shooting skills, and was selected as a Shandong shooting hero. In the Battle of Baimaguan in 1947, he won the First Class Merit Medal. Another First Class People's Hero Medal was awarded by the East China Field Army in commemoration of his killing of more than 360 enemies over the past three years. Two years ago, he was warmly welcomed and loved by young people from all over the world when he attended the World Labor Youth Congress in Poland.

　　I celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the establishment of the People's Liberation Army with infinite joy.

　　Twenty-three years ago today, a bright red flag was planted on the head of Nanchang City. Soon, the red flag spread all over Jinggang Mountain. Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, thousands upon thousands of working people formed the Chinese people's revolutionary armed forces—the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. In the past twenty-three years, it has endured all kinds of hardships, overcome numerous difficulties, and finally defeated the two powerful armed enemies of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, and established the People's Republic of China, making the masses of people the masters of the new China!

　　Thinking back to when I joined the army, it was the 15th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. At that time, we were persisting in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. The weapons of the Japanese devils were sophisticated, but we had some tattered weapons. We seized new equipment from the enemy in countless battles and armed ourselves.

　　After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the active support of U.S. imperialism, launched the heinous civil war. The powerful People's Liberation Army responded to it with a merciless counterattack.

　　I remember it was in June 1946 when Chiang's 54th Army attacked the Liberated Areas from Qingdao along the Jiaoji Railway. When they crawled to Nanquan Station, a regiment of ours blocked the enemy's advance with less than one-eleventh of the enemy's strength. In this battle, I ended the lives of 110 bandits with 125 bullets.

　　In order to defend the freedom and happiness of the people, every commander and fighter of our Liberation Army hates the enemy and fiercely strikes and annihilates the enemy. If I simply add up the 361 enemies that I personally killed in the Liberation War, it would be enough to offset two reinforced companies of bandits.

　　Today, the remaining bandits are still entrenched in Taiwan, Tibet, and other places, and the U.S. imperialist Seventh Fleet has also sailed to Taiwan, attempting to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan. Our People's Liberation Army must liberate Taiwan, Tibet, and all other territories belonging to China from the U.S. aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The bloody war provoked by the U.S. aggressors in Korea is suffering a shameful defeat. I believe that any provocation by the U.S. aggressors against our people will surely suffer a more shameful and thorough defeat.

　　Participate in the Battle to Liberate Taiwan with Selfless Spirit and Firm Will
　　Third Field Army CPPCC Delegate Model Female Medical Worker Li Landing

　　Editor's note: Li Landing, a nationally renowned female medical worker, is an alternate delegate of the Third Field Army to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In the years of arduous struggle against the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit gang, she often followed the troops, risking her life, and enthusiastically and thoughtfully carried out the work of transferring and treating the wounded, while also being alert and brave. In the autumn of 1946, when she led a stretcher team to transfer with the army while ill, they were often bombed by enemy planes and supplies were cut off. She led by example and mobilized others to tighten their belts and save food for the stretcher team and the wounded. At night, she was disturbed by high fever and work and could not sleep all night, so that once, when she personally carried a stretcher and waded across a waist-deep stream to climb a mountain several feet high, she actually broke her second rib on her left chest.

　　I always think this way: If I had not been educated and cultivated by the Party and the People's Army, then I would still be a vulgar old-society midwife or doctor who only cares about personal gain, using technology as a commodity for sale and bowing to serve a few people.

　　I also think this way: Although I have performed some tasks, my contribution to the people is still very small.

　　Therefore, I will strengthen my efforts to train myself in the future in order to catch up with my comrades. I will definitely endure hardships with my comrades, contribute more, enjoy less, and serve the people better.

　　I am now participating in the attack-Taiwan surgical team. I am determined to be with my comrades, to participate in the battle to liberate Taiwan with a selfless spirit and unwavering will, and to smash any provocations by U.S. imperialism. At the same time, I must also unite new personnel in a principled way and strive for the construction of a regular, modern national defense army hospital.

　　Strive to Build the National Defense Army and Oppose American Aggressors
　　Third Field Army First Class People's Hero Liu Kuiji

　　Editor's note: Liu Kuiji, our country's combat hero representative who attended the Second World Youth Congress last year, is from Penglai, Shandong, and is an outstanding Communist Party member. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was already a second-class disabled soldier. His superiors asked him to return to civilian life, but he ran back secretly. Later, he was seriously injured several times and became a first-class disabled soldier. His superiors mobilized him to return to civilian life several times, but he refused. In the Zhilanzhuang battle in Jiaodong in 1946, he was wounded while covering the troops' assault, captured more than a dozen enemies, and single-handedly captured a light machine gun.

　　The "August 1st" Army Day is here again. I remember last year today, I was gloriously participating in the Second World Youth Congress in Budapest, Hungary. On the way to the meeting, I was warmly loved by foreign youths. People wanted me to sign autographs, kiss me, hug me, and ask me to explain the battle stories of our Liberation Army. When I passed through the Soviet Union on my way back to China, I was warmly received by Soviet youths. When I returned to the troops, I was warmly welcomed by the people along the way. I feel infinitely honored. I sincerely thank the Party, Chairman Mao, and the leaders and comrades of the troops for their education, cultivation, and help.

　　Whenever I am so warmly loved by the people, it is easy for me to think of my past. I was a poor boy since I was a child. When I went to Shenyang to work at the age of thirteen, the bosses thought I was dirty and stupid. They beat me, scolded me, and called me "fool," "idiot"... When I fell ill and was unable to work, they drove me away. At that time, I wanted to cry, but what was the use of crying? Tears can only flow into my stomach.

　　The revolution made me find my true "home." In the past few years, under the education and help of the Party, my superiors, and my comrades, I have changed from a despised "idiot" and "fool" to a hero loved by the people. Over the past few years, I have endured hardships and difficulties like my comrades. Whenever there were hardships and difficulties, the Party told me, "Don't forget your roots." This sentence has become a great force that enables me to overcome difficulties and fight bravely. Whenever I and my comrades overcome difficulties together, I always sincerely shout, "Chairman Mao, you are so great!" Today, when commemorating "August 1st" Army Day, I shout: Long live our beloved Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu! I sincerely wish our leaders good health!

　　When we commemorate "August 1st" this year, just as our Chinese people are marching towards the great new period of economic recovery and peaceful construction under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet government, instigated by U.S. imperialism, launched an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. U.S. imperialism, this man-eating wolf, directly sent troops to interfere in the Korean civil war and carried out inhumane massacres of the Korean people. The United States also openly sent its navy to Taiwan, attempting to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan. This behavior of the U.S. imperialists is an open act of aggression against our People's Republic of China. I knew about this and felt very angry. I fully support and resolutely implement the statement made by Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou on this matter. I tell the U.S. imperialists, this paper tiger, that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with. We have the wise Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao is an invincible force. Chairman Mao once led us to defeat the Japanese imperialists who had invaded the Chinese people for eight years. Chairman Mao once led us to eliminate the millions of reactionary troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who were equipped by U.S. imperialism and trained by U.S. imperialism. I firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will surely be able to liberate Taiwan. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are guaranteed and confident that we will be able to defeat any provocation by the U.S. imperialists. With Chairman Mao, a powerful People's Liberation Army, and a long-tested people, we are not afraid of anything.

　　Let those imperialist reactionaries dare to move an inch of our land! We will give them an impolite blow and cut off their claws with one knife!

　　Dear heroic comrades, model comrades, and all respected comrades-in-arms of the National People's Liberation Army, we must unite closely under the banner of our leader Mao Zedong, work hard to move forward, actively work in our individual posts, highly promote our heroic role, and rapidly promote our troops to a modern national defense army. Let us be like an iron wall, effectively defending our national defense, effectively defending the victory that the Chinese people have achieved, and effectively preventing the aggression of U.S. imperialism. In particular, our dear comrades-in-arms in East China, our task is even more arduous and heavy, because our combat mission has not yet ended. We must build the national defense army on the one hand and actively learn the skills of crossing the sea on the other. We must cautiously defend our national defense. Once Chairman Mao's order is issued, we will immediately go to liberate Taiwan. We must also oppose imperialist aggression and support the Korean people's liberation war with practical actions of actively learning skills and striving to build the national defense army.

　　Comrades, our position during the combat period is at the forefront of the battle, and during the peace period is at the forefront of national defense. We are always a strong combat team and defenders of peace.

　　Commemorating August 1st and Resolutely Liberating Taiwan
　　Fourth Field Army Combat Hero Li Guangzheng

　　Editor's note: In the Siping Street battle in 1947, Li Guangzheng made a special contribution by blowing up the enemy-held Red Building twelve times in a row. He resolutely completed his tasks in previous battles, and has successively made two special merits and two major merits, and won the "Chairman Mao Medal," "Hero Medal," "Hard Struggle Medal," and two "Bravery Medals."

　　The founding anniversary of the People's Liberation Army is here! Today, when we have achieved national victory, we feel particularly excited and happy to celebrate the great Army Day. But the heinous U.S. imperialists are enemies of the people and are undermining world peace. Recently, they not only sent troops to invade Korea, but also announced the dispatch of warships to invade Taiwan, dreaming of blocking the righteous march of our People's Liberation Army to liberate the people of Taiwan. This is really outrageous! We want to solemnly warn the U.S. imperialist mad dog: Taiwan is Chinese territory. This is a historical fact and is recognized by the people of the world today. We will never allow the U.S. bandits to seize Taiwan! Our People's Liberation Army has twenty-three years of combat experience, overthrew Japanese imperialism, and annihilated more than five million fully U.S.-equipped Chiang bandit troops. We are an invincible iron army. If the U.S. bandits have not learned enough from the severe blows they have suffered on the Korean battlefield, and want to further invade the sacred territory of our People's Motherland, we will thoroughly expose this paper tiger, which is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and smash their heads and bleed them! Our weapons are ready at any time. Whoever wants to oppose our Chinese people, we will overthrow them and eliminate them!

　　The People of Asia are no longer to be bullied
　　Fourth Field Army Combat Hero Liu Meicun

　　Editor's note: Liu Meicun is the political instructor of a certain battalion of the Fourth Field Army. He is a combat hero who has made one special merit, one major merit, and two minor merits, and is a model political instructor for the entire division. He once led a local guerrilla team of twenty to forty people in Shandong and persisted in fighting behind enemy lines for more than two years. During the Northeast Liberation War, he participated in the battles to liberate Changchun, Sanxia Jiangnan (referring to the Songhua River), and liberate Siping. In the Battle of Siping, he commanded the entire company to defeat and annihilate two battalions and one regiment of the enemy, capturing more than 400 enemies; he himself was wounded twice. He was the representative of the Fourth Field Army at the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　I welcome our army's Army Day with great excitement, and at the same time, I oppose the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea with full of anger. Recalling the 23 years since the birth of our army, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and with the support and love of the people of the whole country, we defeated the Chiang bandit encirclement and suppression under the command of imperialism, we also defeated the famous robber Japanese fascists in the world, and even more annihilated millions of Chiang bandit gangs equipped with US equipment, welcoming the birth of the new People's Republic of China. On this great Army Day, I shout victory for the people of the whole country, and I wish Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu long life. In the face of the victorious struggle of our people, the dying U.S. imperialism vainly attempts to solve its crisis with war, and directly attacks the Korean people and invades my Taiwan. I believe that this barbaric fascist destruction action will not only fail to solve its crisis, but will only accelerate its death. Under the iron fist of the Korean People's Army, the ugly state of the U.S. aggressors' rout has been fully exposed. These facts tell the U.S. imperialists that the people of Asia today are no longer so easy to bully. How small U.S. imperialism is in front of the people! As for the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Taiwan, from my actual combat experience, there is no doubt that our People's Liberation Army will certainly realize the hope of the people of the whole country after the preparation is completed - to liberate Taiwan, and no inch of land will be allowed to be occupied by imperialism and its running dogs. Furthermore, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we must unite with the peace-loving people of the world into a strong bulwark and fight to defend world peace.

### 战斗英雄撰文庆祝“八一”

第3版()
专栏：

　　战斗英雄撰文庆祝“八一”
    我坚决地用瓦子街的战斗精神保卫祖国
    第一野战军战斗英雄  刘四虎
    编者按：刘四虎是宜川战役中最出色的一个战斗英雄。一九四八年的宜川战役，我军歼敌三万余，使蒋胡匪军阵营大为震动，整个地改变了西北战场的形势。他在宜川瓦子街一战时，曾一连刺死刺伤了七个敌人。当他负了十一处伤，卫生员来抬他时，还拒绝说：“我不用抬，你们赶上去抬其他负伤的战友。”现在刘四虎的故事已经编成戏剧，学习刘四虎的运动也已在西北军区普遍展开。
    我叫刘四虎，是绥远丰镇人。从前家里很穷，我自小就当学徒受苦。我父亲是个泥水匠，被地主逼得上吊死了。旧社会穷人没法活。一九四六年我就自动参加了解放军，现在已成了一个光荣的共产党员，并且又当了副连长。我现在人民解放军一军一团工作。我是共产党救活的，培养成人的，所以当今天我军建军二十三周年的纪念日，又是全国各地热烈举行反对美帝国主义侵略台湾朝鲜运动的时候，我想说一说我心里的话，作为纪念这个日子的礼物。
    我是人民解放军的战士，在炮火中锻炼出来的。我已宣誓决心终生做一个光荣的人民国防军的战士。美帝国主义这些战争强盗们过去帮助蒋介石匪帮来屠杀中国人民，被我们中国人民赶出了中国大陆，现在一方面继续侵略我国的台湾，又支持朝鲜傀儡政府李承晚在朝鲜挑起内战，却被朝鲜人民军打了个落花流水，打得美军成批成批地死伤和当俘虏，许多美国兵吓得得了“吃惊病”。事实证明：美帝国是个一戳即破的纸老虎，而世界爱好和平人民的力量是强大无比的。我现在郑重警告美帝：世界上以苏联为首的爱好和平的千千万万的人民，坚决反对战争，但并不害怕战争；我们绝对拥护和平，而并不是向帝国主义乞求和平。今天，我首先宣誓：我愿为解放我国领土台湾、西藏，保卫世界持久和平来继续发挥我在瓦子街歼敌战中，单身冲入敌阵，一连刺死刺伤七个敌人的勇气。在必要时，我将献出我的生命。我并紧密团结我一起的战友，努力生产，加油学习，来支援兄弟部队，打垮美帝国主义的侵略军。
    我们要解放西藏台湾，不怕美国鬼子！
    第一野战军战斗英雄  周黑子
    编者按：战斗英雄周黑子在历次战斗中，都表现的有勇、有智，并善于从思想上带领战士，发挥群众的力量，造成群众性的勇敢。如一九四八年的邠县战斗中，他带领全班以少胜多，解决了敌人一个指挥部，而自己却毫无伤亡。
    我们住在黄河发源地的青海。为了赶快解放西藏，我们担负了修建青藏公路的任务。当我们在报纸上看到美帝国主义杜鲁门六月二十七日的声明，宣布出兵进攻朝鲜，又宣布侵略我国台湾，还干涉越南及菲律宾，气得我们两眼冒火，一致要求上级赶快下命令去打台湾，把美国鬼子和蒋介石一下埋到海里去。我们中国人民解放军过去打垮了日本鬼子，三年解放战争又把大陆上的蒋匪军消灭了，丢下台湾和西藏这个小地方还能解放不了吗？
    现在我为了解放西藏，坚决要完成修建青藏公路的任务。虽然在摄氏零下十八度的严寒气候下，已完成了鄂拉山以东的全部工程；在“泛浆地”上打建起“水冲不垮，车压不塌”的路基，不久就要通车了。
    对于美国鬼子兵的侵略朝鲜人民，我们坚决的反对。我们坚决的愿意支援朝鲜人民军，把他们消灭干净！
    警告美国侵略者
    第三野战军战斗英雄  魏来国
    编者按：魏来国是一位杰出的射击手。贫农出身。一九四六年在山东南泉阻击战役中，凭着他百发百中的射击技术，击退了敌人一个纵队的进攻，被选为山东射击英雄。一九四七年白马关一役，又荣膺一等功奖章。另外一枚一级人民英雄章，是华东野战军纪念他三年多来杀死敌人三百六十余人而颁发的。前年他在波兰出席世界劳动青年大会时，曾受到各国青年热烈的欢迎和爱戴。
    我以无限愉快的心情，庆贺人民解放军建立二十三周年。
    二十三年前的今天，一杆鲜明的红旗插在南昌城头，不久红旗又插遍了井岗山，成千成万的劳动人民，在毛主席、朱总司令的亲身领导下，组成了中国人民革命的武装部队——中国工农红军。它在二十三年来，吃尽千辛万苦，战胜重重困难，终于打败了日本帝国主义和美帝国主义的走狗国民党反动派这两个强大的武装的敌人，建立了中华人民共和国，使人民大众翻身做了新中国的主人！
    回想我参加部队的时候，正是人民解放军建军的十五周年。那时，我们在敌人后方坚持游击战争，日本鬼子的武器是精良的，而我们却是一些破烂的武器。我们从无数次战斗中，夺取敌人的新式装备，武装了自己。
    抗战结束后，国民党反动派在美帝国主义的积极支持下，发动了万恶的内战。强大的人民解放军，以无情的反击答复了它。
    我记得是在一九四六年的六月间，蒋匪五十四军从青岛沿胶济路向解放区进攻。当他们爬行到南泉车站时，我们一个团以不及敌人十一分之一的兵力阻挡了敌人的前进。我在这次战斗中以一百二十五发子弹，结束了一百一十个匪军的性命。
    为了保卫人民的自由和幸福，我们解放军每个指战员憎恨敌人，狠狠地打击和消灭敌人。如果单是把我个人在解放战争中杀死的三百六十一名敌人加起来，就足够抵上匪军二个加强连。
    今天，残余的匪军还盘踞在台湾、西藏等地，美帝国主义的第七舰队也已开到台湾，妄图阻扰我们解放台湾。我们人民解放军一定要从美国侵略者和蒋介石匪帮手中解放台湾、解放西藏及其他属于中国的一切领土。美国侵略者在朝鲜挑起的血腥战争，正遭到可耻的失败。我相信：美国侵略者对我国人民的任何挑衅，一定要遭到更可耻、更彻底的失败。
    以忘我的精神坚定的意志参加解放台湾的战役
    第三野战军政协代表模范女医务工作者  李蓝丁
    编者按：闻名全国的女医务员李蓝丁，是第三野战军出席人民政治协商会议的候补代表。她在与日寇和国民党匪帮作艰苦战斗的岁月里，经常跟随着队伍，出生入死，热诚、周到，同时机警、勇敢地作着转运、医疗伤员的工作。一九四六年秋，她带病率领担架队随军转移时，常遭敌机轰炸，供给间断。她以身作则，并动员别人勒紧腰带，节约粮食给担架队和伤员；夜里，又被高烧和工作扰乱得彻夜不能睡眠，以至在有一次亲自抬着一副担架，涉过水深没腰的小河转上高达数丈的山岗时，竟将左胸第二条肋骨压折。
    我总是这样想：如果我不是在党和人民军队的教育和培养下，那么至今我将仍是个庸俗的为个人打算的旧社会的助产士或医生，以技术作为买卖的商品，低头服役于少数人。
    我也这样想：虽然我执行了一些任务，但我对人民的贡献还是很渺小。
    因此，今后我要加强努力锻炼自己，以赶上同志们。我一定和同志们一起忍受艰苦，做到多贡献、少享受，更好的为人民服务。
    我现在参加了攻台手术队。我坚决和同志们在一起，以忘我的精神和坚定不移的意志，来参加解放台湾的战役，粉碎美帝国主义的任何挑衅。同时，我也要有原则地团结新来人员，为正规化、现代化的国防军医院建设而努力。
    努力建设国防军反对美国侵略者
    第三野战军一级人民英雄  刘奎基
    编者按：去年出席第二次世界青年代表大会的我国战斗英雄代表刘奎基，山东蓬莱人，是一个优秀的共产党员。抗日战争时，他已是二等残废，上级让他复员，他却偷跑了回来。后来又重伤数次，变成一等残废，上级几次动员他复员，都被他拒绝了。在一九四六年胶东芝兰庄战斗中，他负伤掩护部队突击，俘掳了十多个敌人，并只身夺下了一挺轻机枪。
    “八一”节又到来了。记得去年今天，我正在匈京布达佩斯光荣地参加世界青年第二次代表大会。在那赴会途中，我受到了外国青年热烈的爱戴，人们要我签字，和我接吻，把我抱起来，要我讲解咱解放军的战斗故事。在回国经过苏联时，又受到苏联青年的热忱招待。回到部队时，沿途又受到人民的热烈欢迎。我感到无限荣幸，我衷心的感谢党、毛主席和部队各首长及同志们对我的教育，培养与帮助。
    每当自己受到人民这样热情爱戴的时候，就很容易使我联想到我的往事。我自小是个穷小子，十三岁那年上沈阳做工，老板们嫌我脏，嫌我笨，他们打我，骂我，喊我“傻子”、“痴子”……。当我病倒无力工作时，就把我赶走了。当时我要哭，但哭有什么用呢？眼泪只有往肚子里流。
    革命使我找到了真正的“家”。几年来，在党和上级及同志们的教育帮助下，我由一个被人鄙视的“痴子”、“傻子”而变成了人民爱戴的英雄。几年来，我和同志们一样历尽了艰苦和困难，每当艰苦困难的情况下，党告诉我：“不要忘本”，这句话便成了使我克服困难，勇敢战斗的巨大力量。每当自己和同志们一道战胜了困难时，我总是衷心的喊一声：“毛主席你真伟大呀！”在今天纪念“八一”节时，我高呼：我们敬爱的毛主席朱总司令万岁！衷心敬祝咱们的领袖身体健康！
    我们今年纪念“八一”的时候，正当我们中国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，走向经济恢复和和平建设的伟大的新时期，爆发了由美帝国主义所策动的南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进攻，美帝国主义这个吃人狼并直接出兵干涉朝鲜内战，对朝鲜人民进行毫无人性的屠杀。美国又公然出动海军，想阻止我们解放台湾。美帝这种行为，是向我们中华人民共和国公开进行侵略的行为。我知道了这件事，心里非常愤怒。我完全拥护并坚决执行毛主席和周总理为这件事的声明。告诉美帝国主义这个纸老虎，我们中国人民是不好惹的，我们有英明的毛主席，毛主席是无敌的力量。毛主席曾领导我们打败了侵略中国人民八年的日本帝国主义，毛主席曾领导我们消灭了美帝国主义装备起来的并经美帝一手训练的蒋介石匪帮的数百万反动部队。我万分相信，在毛主席领导下，我们一定能解放台湾。在毛主席领导下，有保证有把握的一定能打败美帝国主义者的任何挑衅。我们有了毛主席，有了强大的人民解放军，有了久经锻炼的人民，我们就什么也不怕。
    让那些帝国主义反动派胆敢动我们一寸国土吧！我们就给他个不客气，一刀就把他们爪子砍掉！
    全国人民解放军亲爱的英雄同志们、模范同志们及所有敬爱的战友们，咱们要紧紧团结在领袖毛泽东的旗帜下，努力前进，在个人的岗位上积极工作、高度发扬我们的英雄作用，把我们的部队迅速推向近代化的国防军，让我们象一块铁壁一样，有效的保卫住国防，有效的保卫中国人民已取得的胜利，有效的防备美帝国主义的侵略。特别是咱们华东全体亲爱的战友们，咱们的任务更加艰巨繁重，因为咱们的战斗任务还没有结束，咱们还要一面建设国防军，一面积极学习渡海作战的本领。我们要谨慎的保卫住国防，等毛主席的命令一下，我们就马上去解放台湾。我们还要以积极学本领，努力建设国防军的实际行动，反对帝国主义的侵略，支援朝鲜人民解放战争。
    同志们，我们的岗位在战斗时期是站在战斗的最前线，在和平时期是站在国防的最前线，我们永远是坚强的战斗队，和平的保卫者。
    纪念八一坚决解放台湾
    第四野战军战斗英雄  李广正
    编者按：李广正在一九四七年的四平街战役中，曾连续十二次爆破敌人据守的红楼而立了特功。并在历次战役中坚决完成了任务，先后共立了两个特功，两个大功，荣膺“毛主席奖章”、“英雄奖章”、“坚苦奋斗奖章”和两个“勇敢奖章”。
    人民解放军的建军节到了！在我们取得全国胜利的今天，来庆祝伟大的建军节，我们感到特别兴奋和愉快。但是万恶的美帝国主义正在与人民为敌，破坏世界和平。最近他不但派兵侵略朝鲜，而且宣布派兵舰侵略台湾，梦想阻挡我人民解放军解放台湾人民的正义进军。这真是再混蛋也没有了！我们要正告美帝这条疯狗：台湾是中国的领土，这是过去历史事实和今天全世界人民所公认的。美国强盗想抢占台湾，我们是坚决不容许的！我们人民解放军有二十三年的战斗经验，打倒了日本帝国主义和消灭了五百余万完全美械化的蒋匪军，我们是一支无坚不摧的铁军。如果美国强盗在朝鲜战场上受到的严重打击还不够教训自己，而要进一步侵犯我人民祖国的神圣领土的话，我们就要彻底戳穿这只外强中干的纸老虎，把他砸得头破血流！我们的武器随时准备好，谁想和我们中国人民作对，我们就要打倒谁，就要消灭谁！
    亚洲人民不是好欺负的了
    第四野战军战斗英雄  刘梅村
    编者按：刘梅村是四野某营营教导员，是曾经立过一特功，一大功，两小功的战斗英雄，是全师的模范教导员。他曾在山东领导一支二十人到四十人的地方游击队，坚持敌后斗争两年多。在东北解放战争中，他曾参加过解放长春、三下江（指松花江）南，及解放四平的战役。在四平战役中，他指挥全连打垮与消灭了敌人两营及一个团，俘敌四百余；他自己负伤两次。人民政协第一届全体会议上，他是第四野战军的代表。
    我以高度的兴奋迎接我军的建军节，同时以满腔的愤怒反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜。回忆我军诞生二十三年来，我们在毛主席、朱总司令领导下，全国人民支援爱护下，战胜了帝国主义指挥下的蒋匪围剿，也战胜了世界上的著名强盗日本法西斯蒂、更歼灭了美械装备的蒋匪帮数百万军队，迎接了新的中华人民共和国的诞生。在此伟大建军节日。我为全国人民高呼胜利，我祝毛主席、朱总司令万岁。在我们人民胜利斗争的面前，垂死的美帝国主义妄想以战争来解决他们的危机，竟直接的向朝鲜人民进攻，并侵略我台湾。这种蛮横的法西斯蒂破坏行动，我认为不只解决不了它的危机，而且只有加速其死亡。在朝鲜人民军的铁拳下，美国侵略者溃逃的丑态，已暴露无遗。这些事实告诉了美帝国主义者，今天的亚洲人民，已经不是那样好欺负的了。美帝国主义在人民面前是多么样的渺小！至于美帝国主义对我台湾的侵略，从我实际的战斗体验中，毫无疑问的，我们人民解放军一定会在准备完成之后，实现全国人民的希望——解放台湾，一寸土地也不允许帝国主义及其走狗盘据。我们并且要在毛主席和朱总司令的英明领导下，与世界爱好和平的人民团结成坚强的壁垒，为保卫世界和平而斗争。
