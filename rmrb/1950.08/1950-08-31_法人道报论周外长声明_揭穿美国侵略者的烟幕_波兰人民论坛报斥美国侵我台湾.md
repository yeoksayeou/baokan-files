Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 29th: The French newspaper L'Humanité published a commentary on the 26th, commenting on Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram on the 24th requesting the Security Council to sanction the U.S. aggression against China's Taiwan, stating: The U.S. imperialist act against Taiwan "is, as in the Korean affair, a colonialist act of aggression."

The commentary pointed out: It is imaginable how furious U.S. imperialism is about the Taiwan issue being brought to the United Nations. However, they (referring to the United States) cannot evade the debate that has already taken place within the United Nations, and the issue has been well raised. Zhou Enlai's statement and Malik's report have torn apart the "smoke screen" that attempts to obscure the imperialist nature of the United States' entire Asian policy. U.S. imperialism attempts to undermine the discussions in the United Nations, but issues like this can never be resolved merely by using a "majority" vote that is at their beck and call.

The commentary concluded by mocking the U.S. imperialists, saying: "It is too late, the people of Asia have taken great strides on the road to liberation, and nothing can stop them. When a cruiser fights a sailing ship, the former can certainly carry out brutal slaughter, but the people on the sailing ship will surely defeat the mercenaries on the cruiser. This is not a wish, but a fact that has been proven by great and decisive victories."
Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: Polish News Agency, Warsaw, August 28th: The Polish People's Tribune commented on the U.S. aggression against Taiwan, stating: The United States recently even raised the question of whether Taiwan truly belongs to China. Tracing back some decisions and official statements from the United States is sufficient to prove China's undeniable right to Taiwan. The People's Tribune pointed out that the imperialists have continued their aggression against China more openly and shamelessly. But they cannot carry out this trade for much longer. There was a time when Wall Street ruled all of China, not just Taiwan. At that time, U.S. imperialism and its puppets not only massacred people on China's borders, but also throughout the country. But that era has ended with the shameful defeat of the aggressors. Any other acts of aggression against People's China will only result in failure.

    揭穿美国侵略者的烟幕
    波兰人民论坛报斥美国侵我台湾
    【新华社布拉格二十九日电】法国人道报二十六日发表专论，评论我外交部周恩来部长二十四日要求安理会制裁美国侵略我国台湾的电文称：美国帝国主义对台湾的行为，“正和在朝鲜事件中一样，是殖民主义者的侵略行为”。
    专论指出：美国帝国主义对于台湾问题提到联合国有多么愤怒，是可以想像的。但是他们（指美国）无法回避已在联合国内的辩论，问题已经被很好地提出来了。周恩来的声明和马立克的报告，拨开了企图用来掩蔽美国全部亚洲政策的帝国主义本质的“烟幕”。美国帝国主义企图破坏联合国的讨论，但是，像这样的问题决不是仅运用听凭指挥的“多数”票就可以解决得了的。
    专论在结语中嘲弄美国帝国主义者说：“太迟了，亚洲人民已大踏步地走上了解放的道路，没有什么东西可以阻挡得住他们。一艘巡洋舰和一艘帆船作战时，前者固然可以进行残暴的屠杀，但是帆船上的人们必将战胜巡洋舰上的雇佣军。这不是一种愿望，而是已经由伟大的决定性的胜利所证明了的事实。”
    【新华社三十日讯】波兰通讯社华沙二十八日讯：波兰人民论坛报评论美国对台湾的侵略行为称：美国最近竟提出台湾是否真正属于中国的问题。追溯一下若干决定和美国官方的声明，就足以证明中国对台湾有无可争辩的权利。人民论坛报指出帝国主义者已更公开、更厚颜无耻地继续他们对中国的侵略。但是他们进行这种交易已不能有多久了。曾经有一个时期，华尔街曾统治了全中国，而不仅是台湾。当时美帝国主义及其傀儡不仅在中国的边境，而且曾在全国屠杀人民。但是那个时代已经以侵略者的可耻失败而告终了。对人民中国其他侵略的行为，其结果将只有失败一途。
