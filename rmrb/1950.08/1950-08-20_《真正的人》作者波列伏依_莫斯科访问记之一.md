Polevoy, Author of "The True Man"
	– One of My Moscow Visit Notes
	Liú Báiyǔ
	When I visited Polevoy in Moscow, I felt a sense of warmth, as if old friends were suddenly reunited after a long time apart.

	On June 30th, we arrived at his home at the appointed time. He lives on Gorky Street, near Leningrad Avenue, in a seven-story building. The female comrade managing the elevator helped us press the doorbell, and the door immediately opened. A man wearing a Ukrainian embroidered shirt came out, immediately shaking my hand tightly and introducing himself, "Polevoy." His wife, Yulia, followed closely behind in the doorway. They were both smiling so happily. After we were led into his study, Polevoy's opening words were so good. He said, "Welcome, not only because you are Chinese writers visiting my home, but also because I heard you are from the military." Indeed, this sentence dispelled all my guest-like feelings – I remembered his military overcoat hanging in the doorway, I remembered his job as a military reporter, I remembered his widely circulated work "The True Man"... No matter how much time has passed, no matter how far apart our respective front lines are, but fighting for the same ideals, we are indeed as if we have met on the same front line.

	The afternoon sun quietly shone through the gauze curtains on the window. The study was clean and comfortable. The host's desk was full of drafts, obviously he had been working diligently at the desk not long ago.

	Polevoy is from Kalinin. His experience, like some writers who grew up in the Soviet era, was that he initially participated in practical work, and was later discovered and cultivated to become an excellent writer. Polevoy was initially a chemical worker, but when he was a reporter for a newspaper in a Moscow factory, the Communist Youth League organization discovered him. Since then, he has been a journalist, working first for the Communist Youth League newspaper and later for "Pravda," for more than twenty years. He told me:

	"Many of the newest writers are emerging from journalism."

	His first work, "Hot Workshop," was written in 1939. That book was based on the lives of workers in a factory in Kalinin. Polevoy's writing career began with that book, but it wasn't until after the Patriotic War, after the publication of "The True Man," that it was immediately widely welcomed by the Soviet people, making Polevoy an outstanding and successful writer on the Soviet literary front. "The True Man" won the first prize of the Stalin Prize in 1946, and the short story collection "We are Soviet People" won the Stalin Prize in 1948. Recently, the novel "Gold" has also been published. These works have a common feature: the characters and events written about are all real people and real events in real life, and these characters and events were obtained by him as a journalist. This is Polevoy's characteristic, which is the question I wanted to understand in particular when I visited him.

	Our conversation turned to his creative work.

	He said: "During the war, I once wrote an article from the front line and published it in the newspaper. The article described how in 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia. At that time, Napoleon captured an old man from the Polish army named Kuzmin, forcing him to lead the way to the Russian army. As a result, Kuzmin led them into the forest, and had his grandson report to the Russian army, thus destroying the Polish army. Kuzmin also died there.

	"This fact is very important, but the article was not well written. When I returned to 'Pravda,' I was criticized. The head of the Political Department of the Soviet Red Army found me for a talk. He said: You are a Soviet officer, a writer, a Soviet person – you should write down what you have experienced, keep a diary, record the names and places, no matter who writes it in the future, this is a very important basis. Since then, I have been writing a diary without interruption, recording sixty-eight events during the entire Patriotic War. 'The True Man' is one of them."

	I asked: "How did you meet Meresyev?"

	Anyone who has read the novel "The True Man" and watched the movie "The Story of a Real Man" cannot but be moved by the legless air force hero Meresyev described by Polevoy. He lost both legs in an air battle against the German invaders, but his strong will overcame all difficulties. He was eventually able to return to air combat with a pair of prosthetic legs. Meresyev will forever be a heroic example in the minds of people all over the world.

	He said: "Once the newspaper sent me to interview an air force guards fighter regiment. At that time, the battle situation was very urgent – that day each plane took off six times for combat – I went to the commander, who was so busy he was dizzy, unable to tell me anything, and sent me to the political commissar. But what could the political commissar do? He sent me to an air force captain. Just waiting for the last batch of planes to return, the captain hurriedly said: 'Meresyev is back, he can give you the materials!' I watched Meresyev jump out of the plane, and I immediately went to find him. He was a lieutenant at the time, and I was a major. He couldn't get rid of me, but he said he was very tired. I told him I was from 'Pravda,' and he said: 'Have you eaten? No? Then great. We get one hundred and fifty grams of vodka for shooting down a plane, and I shot down two today, so I already have three hundred grams, plus the daily allowance, I already have four hundred grams. So I'll treat you to some wine, and we can talk.' So I followed him for an afternoon. At night I was very tired, and returned to his residence. I went to sleep and heard him take off his boots and throw them on the ground. The sound was very heavy. I turned around and saw a pair of long boots. I thought someone had climbed under my bed. Meresyev laughed and said: 'Those are my legs.' I said: 'Don't joke!' – I pulled back his blanket, and indeed he had no legs. I wrote a dispatch about his deeds. The editor of the newspaper came to me and said: Considering the political situation now, it cannot be published, the German invaders are spreading propaganda that we are running out of manpower. But he instructed me: You must write it into a book in the future, and now this book is 'The True Man'."

	At the same time, he cited his other short story collection "We are Soviet People" as an example, where the twenty-eight characters written are also real people.

	At this time, Yulia brought a large plate of fresh strawberries to entertain us.

	He continued to answer my questions about being a journalist and writing while eating strawberries.

	He said: -- Collected materials while performing journalistic tasks, and then added artistic expression and description.

	He completed this long story of more than 200,000 words, "The True Man," in just nineteen days, which is truly amazing. At that time, he was participating in the Nuremberg trial of German fascist war criminals. In the sixth month, he was very free, so he wrote this book. But he didn't have the opportunity to see Meresyev, so he carried the manuscript everywhere. While working in Romania, Yulia called him and said that Meresyev had come to Moscow. Polevoy returned to Moscow and read the book to Meresyev. He said that everything in the book was real, but some used real names and some used fake names. The character Olya, Meresyev's lover in the book, should really be named Karia. The author could determine the character's personality, but at that time he didn't know if they would get married, so in order not to destroy other people's family happiness, he used a fake name – in fact, they really got married later, and now they have children."

	I thought his conversation was answering the question of real people and real events that is often discussed in our domestic literary circles, so I continued to ask.

	He told me: -- A painter named Chukov is painting illustrations for him, and the painter is also drawing from the original real people.

	"Many people ask: Aren't writers afraid that the characters you write about will do bad things in the future and affect your book?

	"No, if you are a writer, you will choose the hero you should write about in reality, your vision will be broader and deeper. Kabudunin in 'We are Soviet People' was a soldier at the time. Now he is a representative of the Supreme Soviet. The heroine of the short story 'The Regiment Flag,' Ulyan Bely Karut, recently wrote a letter saying that she received the Lenin Medal for her harvest achievements in the collective farm. Now let's talk about Meresyev! -- He is now a senior flight instructor, and as a Soviet representative, he often attends the World Peace Defense Congress. Even so, he is still studying so well at the Supreme Party School." To confirm his words, Polevoy called his wife from outside the door. Yulia is a school teacher, and Meresyev often gets her help in his studies. Yulia told us with a smile: Meresyev got excellent grades in his semester exam. Polevoy said: "Facts prove that the characters who were tested in the war continue to be outstanding characters after the war." The protagonist of the novella "Return" is a famous steelworker in Moscow. The names of people and places have been changed because of respect for the protagonist who does not want to recall the past pain. He also did have an apprentice, and after this novella was published, this apprentice did receive the Stalin Prize.

	For "The True Man," a very humorous and profound story once happened. An American reporter bet with three Czech reporters, and the American lost one hundred US dollars. At that time, Polevoy was working as a reporter covering a foreign ministers' meeting. During the break, the three Czech reporters found him. It turned out that an American reporter had a dispute with them. The American reporter believed that there was absolutely no such person as Meresyev, and now he wanted the author to be a witness himself.

	The American reporter said the reasons he didn't believe it: First, he used to be a pilot himself, and he believed that even missing a finger could not fly a plane; Second, if this really happened, this person would definitely get rich, become a general, and wouldn't need to go to the front line to fight hard; Third, even if it is true, you write it into a book, what if he robs or steals in the future?

	At that time, Polevoy replied: "You naturally find it difficult to understand these things. Meresyev will definitely return to the front line, because the reason why he flies without legs is to defend the motherland, not for himself." The American reporter said: "I don't understand, this is your communist propaganda!" Polevoy said: "You understand even less about your third question. If a Soviet person can do such a thing for the motherland, he will definitely not be a bad person in the future." As a result, the American reluctantly took out one hundred US dollars. Later, the Czech reporters wrote an article titled "Miserra Counts Money" and published it in the Czech "Literary Gazette."

	This is a great victory for socialist construction. Socialism has produced new outstanding characters, characters with good qualities and heroic behavior concentrated in one person. At the same time, the writer and the characters he writes about grow up under the same communist morality, advance in the same battle, and are tested on the same road. He not only understands him but also knows him as well as himself. Yes, it is real people and real events, but the reality of the struggle strictly selected this person, a truly outstanding person. Therefore, Polevoy's works "The True Man," "We are Soviet People," and "Gold" also bring the most profound, moving, and widely educational characteristics, praising the highly mature communist morality. Therefore, Meresyev completed a career that no one else could do, so the protagonist in "Return" created a new steelmaking record after the war. He and his apprentice are competing, but also closely united. "Gold" is an expression of how Soviet people eliminate the selfish and self-interested concept of private property.

	The topic turned to another question about the new characteristics of Soviet literature.

	He took out a large bundle of things from the bookshelf and placed it on his lap.

	He patted the bundle and told me: This is three thousand letters from Soviet readers received after the publication of "The True Man." He said: "This weighs fifty kilograms…they are not polite words, but strict criticisms." Looking at his expression, I deeply understood how a Soviet writer treats criticism: how much he respects and how grateful he is to his readers. This is not forced, but completely natural. "This is the best criticism, this is criticism from the people. In a socialist country, an ordinary worker can criticize a scientist, so that the scientist does not shut himself off, but closely connects with reality. Why isn't a work printed into a book immediately after it is published in a magazine? It is because after receiving reader criticism, it is revised." "The True Man" has been revised in as many as sixty-eight places based on the suggestions from the letters. "For example, in 'Gold,' I wrote a scene of baking bread. The Sadov bread workers collectively wrote a letter pointing out that if I baked it the way I described, the bread would definitely burn, and at the same time they told me how to bake it." Soviet writers gave me such a deep impression that they very much welcomed criticism and were prepared to absorb opinions and revise their works at any time. The writer's work is not personal, but part of the people's cause, and Lenin's great ideal has been truly realized.

	Polevoy is the chief editor of the military column of "Pravda," and also an editorial board member of "Spark," "October," and "Soviet Pictorial." But this does not prevent him from writing at the same time – he recently returned from a trip to the Urals, and he is preparing materials for new works.

	If it weren't for another appointment, our conversation would not have stopped. However, the host and his wife enthusiastically insisted on us staying for dinner. Because they are all from the military, Polevoy naturally wanted us to have a glass of vodka. When our eyes were all on a plate of raw green onions, Polevoy and his niece, Valya, a tenth-grade student who came from his hometown of Kalinin, stood up and shook hands with me. Polevoy said: During the war, soldiers in the trenches did not dislike eating raw green onions. I cannot describe the love and kindness that this family showed to the Chinese people. Finally, Polevoy made his request. He hoped that Chinese writers would show more of the reality of the Chinese people's heroic struggle, about the Chinese Communist Party, about Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, about the war… The Soviet people warmly welcomed it, and hoped that these works could be published in the magazines he participated in editing. His wife constantly asked questions at the other end of the table. Polevoy said: "You see! I am attacking you from the publishing aspect, and now she is attacking you from the education aspect!" Everyone laughed. Yulia has Yulia's questions. She said that the children in the school often ask her about China. The children love China and care about China, so they ask so many questions that sometimes she simply cannot answer.

	When we said goodbye and embraced in the doorway, a profound impression remained in my mind: -- True friendship does not necessarily require long-term interaction, but is decided in a moment, because – standing in front of me is not only a writer, but a Soviet person, a new person, a socialist person.

　　《真正的人》作者波列伏依
    ——莫斯科访问记之一
　　刘白羽
    在莫斯科访问波列伏依的时候，我感到如同朋友在远方骤然相会一样的亲切。
    六月三十日，我们按着约定时间，到他家里。他住在高尔基大街将近列宁格勒大道的地方，一幢七层高的楼房里。管理电梯的女同志帮我们按了一下电铃，门立刻打开了，一个穿着乌克兰花边衬衫的人走出来，马上紧紧拉着我的手自己介绍：“波列伏依。”他的夫人犹丽，也紧跟着在门廊里出现了，他们都那样愉快地笑着。当我们被引进到他的书房里后，波列伏依开场的话讲得是那样的好，他说：“非常欢迎，不但因为你们是中国作家到我家里来作客，而且听说你们也是从军队里来的。”实实在在，这一句话解除了我全部作客心情，——我记起他那挂在门廊里的军装大衣，我记起他的军事记者的职业，我记起他那广泛流传的作品《真正的人》，……不管时间已经过去多久，我们各自所在的战线又距离多远，但为了同一理想而斗争，我们确像在同一战线上见过一样了。
    下午的阳光静静的照着窗上的纱幕，书房整洁而舒适。主人的工作台上摆满草稿，显然他不久以前还在桌上辛勤工作。
    波列伏依是加里宁城人，他的经历如同一些在苏维埃时代成长起来的作家一样，最初参加实际工作，后来才被发现和培养成为优秀的作家。波列伏依最初是一个化学工作人员，但是当他在莫斯科一家工厂的报纸做记者时，共产主义青年团组织发现了他，从此他就做新闻记者，开始在共青团报纸，后来在《真理报》工作，已经二十余年。他告诉我：
    “最新的作家，很多是从记者中出现的。”
    他的第一部作品《热车间》著于一九三九年，那本书取材于加里宁城一个工厂的工人生活。从那本书开始了波列伏依的创作生活，但，直到卫国战争后，《真正的人》这部书出版后，才立刻受到苏联人民广泛欢迎，使波列伏依成为苏联文艺战线上卓越的、成功的作家。《真正的人》获得一九四六年斯大林奖金第一等奖，短篇小说集《我们是苏维埃人》，获得一九四八年斯大林奖金。最近又出版了小说《金子》。这些作品里面，有一个共同的特色，就是所写的人物与事件都是现实生活当中的真人真事，而这些人物与事件又都是他作为一个新闻记者时获得的，这是波列伏依的特点，也就是我访问他想特别了解的问题。
    我们的说话转到他的创作问题方面来。
    他说：“在战争时期，有一次我从前线写了一篇文章发表在报纸上。文章描写一八一二年，拿破仑侵入俄罗斯，当时拿破仑从波兰军队捉到一个老人叫库茨敏，迫他带路到俄罗斯军队去，结果库茨敏把他们引入森林，而让他的孙子去报告俄罗斯军队，因此消灭波兰军队，而库茨敏老人也就在那里牺牲了。
    “这事实很重要，可是文章写得不好。回到《真理报》受了批评。苏联红军总政治部部长找我去谈话，他说：你是一个苏联军官，一个作家，一个苏联人，——你应该把你所经历的记下来，写在日记上，把人名、地点都记下来，不管将来谁写，这都是很重要的根据。我从那以后不间断的写日记，在整个卫国战争中记载了六十八个事件，《真正的人》是其中的一个。”
    我问：“你是怎样和密里席耶夫相遇的呢？”
    读过长篇小说《真正的人》，看过电影《钢铁意志》的人，没有一个人不为波列伏依所描写的这位无脚空军英雄密里席耶夫所感动。他在对德寇空战中失去双脚，但顽强的意志战胜一切艰难困苦，他终能用一双假脚重上空中作战，密里席耶夫永远成为全世界人民心目中的英雄典范。
    他说：“有一次报馆派我到一个空军近卫军驱逐飞行团去采访。那时战况非常紧急，——那一天每一架飞机都起飞六次作战，——我到了指挥官那里，他忙得头昏脑胀，无法告诉我什么，把我送给政治委员。可是政治委员又有什么办法呢，他就派我到一个空军队队长那里去。正候最后一批飞机回来，队长就匆匆忙忙说：‘密里席耶夫回来了，他可以给你材料！’我眼看密里席耶夫从飞机上跳下来，我立刻去找他。他那时是中尉，我是少校，他无法赶走我，可是他说他累得很了。我告诉他我是从《真理报》来的，他就说：‘您吃过饭吗？没有？那么好极了。我们打落一架飞机给一百五十克兰姆伏特卡，我今天打落两架，已经有三百克兰姆，加上每日应发的，我已经有四百克兰姆。那么我请你去吃酒，还可以说说。’就这样我跟他走了一下午。到夜间很累了，回到他的住处。我睡下，听见他脱鞋摔在地下，声音很重，我回头一看有一双长靴子。我以为有人爬到我床下，密里席耶夫大笑起来，说：‘那是我的腿。’我说：‘你不要开玩笑吧！’——把他被子掀开，果然是没有腿。我把他的事迹写了一篇通讯。报馆主笔找我说：现在考虑政治形势，不能发表，德寇正宣传我们人力枯竭呢。可是他嘱咐我：你将来一定要把它写成一部书，现在这部书就是《真正的人》。”
    同时他举了他另一短篇小说集《我们是苏维埃人》为例，那里写的二十八个人物也是真人。
    这时，犹丽端了大盘新鲜草莓来款待我们。
    他一面吃着草莓，一面继续答复我所提出关于做记者与写作的问题。
    他说：——在执行记者任务时搜集了材料，然后加以文艺的表现、描写。
    《真正的人》这二十余万言的长篇，他竟以十九天时间完成，这真是令人惊叹的事情。当时，他正在参加纽伦堡的德国法西斯战犯的审判。在第六个月上，很空闲，他就把这部书写成了。但是他没有机会看到密里席耶夫，他就带了原稿到处走。在罗马尼亚工作时，犹丽给他电话说密里席耶夫来到莫斯科了。波列伏依回到莫斯科，就把这书读给密里席耶夫听。他说这书中间都是真人，不过有的用真名，有的用假名。书中密里席耶夫的爱人奥丽亚，真名应该是卡里亚，对于这人物的性格作者是可以断定的，但当时不知道他们到底会不会结婚，为了不应该破坏别人家庭幸福，采用假名，——实际后来他们真的结了婚，而且现在还有了小孩。”
    他的谈话，我以为正在解答我们国内文艺界常常谈论的真人真事问题，我便继续问下去。
    他告诉我：——一位名叫褚可夫的画家正在给他绘制插图，画家也是找原来真人画的。
    “有很多人问：作家不怕你写的人物将来做坏事影响你的书吗？
    “不，如果你是一个作家，你就会在现实中选择你该写的英雄，你的眼光会大些，深些。《我们是苏维埃人》里的卡布杜宁，当时是一个士兵。现在却是最高苏维埃代表，短篇《团旗》的女主角乌里扬·别丽喀鲁特不久前来信，她在集体农庄因为收获成绩得到列宁勋章。现在就说说密里席耶夫吧！——他现在是高等飞行教官，做为苏联代表经常出席保卫世界和平大会，虽然如此，他在最高党校学习得还是那样好。”为了证实他的话，波列伏依到门外把他的夫人叫来。犹丽是一个学校教员，密里席耶夫在学习方面常常得到她的帮助。犹丽笑着告诉我们：密里席耶夫这次学期考试考了优等成绩。波列伏依说：“事实证明，在战争中考验了的人物，在战后继续是出色的人物。”中篇小说《归来》主角，就是莫斯科一位出名的炼钢工人，人名和地名换了，是因为尊重主角不愿回忆过去的悲痛。他也确有一个学徒，在这部小说发表后，这个学徒也确实得到斯大林奖金。
    为了《真正的人》，曾经发生过一个十分幽默又十分深刻的故事，一个美国记者与三个捷克记者打赌，美国人赌输了一百美金。当时波列伏依正做为记者采访一次外长会议。会议休息时，三位捷克记者找到他，原来一个美国记者跟他们起了争论，美国记者认为绝对没有密里席耶夫这个人，现在要作者自己去做证人。
    美国记者说他不相信的理由：第一、他自己从前是飞行员，他认为缺少一个指头也不能驾驶飞机；第二、假如真有此事，这人一定会发财，成为将军，再用不到上前线拚命打仗了；第三、就算真有，你写成书，将来他要是抢人偷人你怎么办？
    当时波列伏依回答：“关于这些事你们自然很难懂，密里席耶夫一定再回战线，因为他没有脚还要飞行就是为了保卫祖国，不是为了自己。”美国记者说：“我不懂，这是你们共产主义的宣传！”波列伏依说：“你的第三个问题，你们更不懂。一个苏联人如果为了祖国能做出这样事情，他将来一定不会是个坏人。”结果，那个美国人很不甘心地把一百美金掏出来。后来，捷克记者把这事写了一篇题名为《密塞拉在数钱》的文章发表在捷克《文学报》上面。
    这是社会主义建设的伟大胜利。社会主义产生了新的优秀的人物，好的品质与英雄行为集中一身的人物。同时作家与他所写的人物，生长在同一共产主义道德之下，在同一战斗下前进，在同一道路上受着考验，他不但了解他而且熟悉他如同熟悉自己。不错，是真人真事，但现实斗争严格地挑选了这个人，是真正的人，卓越的人。所以，波列伏依的作品《真正的人》《我们是苏维埃人》《金子》，也就带来最深刻的、最动人的，最有广泛教育性的特色，表扬了高度成熟的共产主义道德。所以密里席耶夫完成人所不能为的事业，所以《归来》中的主角在战后为了创造了炼钢的新纪录，他与他的学徒是竞赛的、但又是亲密团结的。《金子》是表现苏联人如何摒除自私自利的私产观念。
    话题转到另一个关于苏维埃文学新的特质的问题上来。
    他从书橱中把一大捆东西抱出来，放在自己膝上。
    他拍着那捆东西告诉我：这是《真正的人》发表后，收到苏联读者的三千封信。他说：“这有五十基罗克兰姆重了，……它们不是讲客气话，而是严格的批评。”看他的表情，我非常了解一个苏维埃作家是怎样对待批评的：多么尊重又多么感谢自己的读者。这不是勉强的，而完全出于自然。“这是最好的批评，这是来自人民中间的批评。在社会主义国家中，一个普通工人可以批评一个科学家，这样就使科学家不自己关闭起来，而与现实密切联系起来。为什么作品在杂志上发表后不马上印成书呢？就因为要得到读者批评后，再加以修改。”《真正的人》就根据来信建议修改了六十八处之多。“比如《金子》我写了烤面包的场面，萨得多夫面包工人集体写来一信，指出如果照我那样烤法，面包一定烤焦，同时就告诉我应当怎样怎样烤。”苏联作家给我如此深刻印象，他们非常欢迎批评。而且准备随时吸收意见修改自己作品。作家的作品不是个人的，而是人民事业的一部分，列宁的伟大理想确确实实实现了。
    波列伏依是《真理报》军事栏主笔，同时还是《火星》《十月》《苏联画报》的编辑委员。但这不妨碍他同时进行创作，——他不久前才从乌拉尔旅行回来，他为新的著作在准备材料。
    要不是因为另外一个约会，我们的谈话是不会停止的。但是，主人夫妇热情地坚持留我们吃饭。因为都是军队里来的，波列伏依自然要我们干一杯伏特卡酒。当我们的眼睛都注意到一盘生葱时，波列伏依和由加里宁城故乡来的他的侄女、十年级学生瓦列都站起来跟我握手。波列伏依说：战争时期，在战壕里的士兵是没有不爱吃生葱的。我无法形容这一家人所表露出来的，对于中国人民的热爱与亲切。最后，波列伏依提出他的要求，他希望中国作家多多表现中国人民英勇斗争的现实，关于中国共产党，关于毛主席、朱总司令，关于战争，……苏联人民是非常热烈欢迎的，并且希望这些作品能在他参加编辑的杂志上发表。他的夫人在餐桌另一端不断提出问题。波列伏依说：“你看！我从出版方面向你们进攻，现在该她从教育方面向你们进攻了！”大家都笑了。犹丽有犹丽的问题，她说学校里的孩子们经常问她关于中国的事情，孩子们爱中国，关心中国，因此问的是那样多，有时问的她简直无法回答呢。
    当我们告辞出来，在门廊上拥抱作别时，一种深刻的印象留在我的脑际：——真正的友谊，不一定长年相处，而在一刻钟间就决定了，原因是——站在我面前的，不仅仅是一个作家，而是一个苏联人，新的人，社会主义的人。
