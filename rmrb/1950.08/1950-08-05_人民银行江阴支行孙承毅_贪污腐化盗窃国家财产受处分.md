To the Editor:

Sun Chengyi, head of the Cashier Section of the People's Bank of China, Jiangyin Branch, Jiangsu Province, has been involved in embezzlement, corruption, and theft of state property. The facts are as follows:

Sun Chengyi himself comes from a student background and his family is of poor peasant origin, originally from Fengnan County, Shandong. Since joining the revolutionary work in 1945, he has been working as a cashier in the bank. In 1949, he crossed the Yangtze River southward with the army. Since entering the city, he could not withstand the test of the complex urban environment and gradually embarked on the path of embezzlement and corruption.

Last year, he met a woman named Jiang Peixia (who worked as an inspector and clerk during the Kuomintang era and participated in anti-communist intelligence activities). Through Jiang Peixia's introduction, he met her younger sister, Jiang Wenrui (18 years old, currently working in a yarn factory and a member of the Communist Youth League). Sun once introduced Jiang Wenrui to the leadership to work at the bank, but the bank refused due to lack of understanding of Jiang's situation.

Soon, Sun's relationship with Jiang Wenrui became increasingly close, and they had a physical relationship. On one occasion when Sun Chengyi went to Wuxi to remit funds, he took Jiang Wenrui and her mother along, spending extravagantly along the way and buying things for the Jiang family. Sun also frequently ate and drank at the Jiang family's home, or bought things to entertain the Jiang family mother and daughter.

Sun Chengyi is usually extremely irresponsible in his work, does not abide by work rules, does not sign in, and runs around outside during work hours. On several occasions, the received checks and seal labels were missing, and the recovered cash was randomly placed in drawers or pockets. He once wore a gold ring from the treasury on his own hand, and both the five and twelve taels of silver handed over by the government and the gold handed over by the tax bureau were issued with IOUs by Sun and not registered in the physical accounts. At the same time, he privately withdrew funds from the treasury: In March, he privately lent 500,000 yuan in cash to the deputy captain of the motorcade of the garrison headquarters (according to his own confession, he lent a total of 2 million yuan twice), and lent to Jianzhong Company three times, each time 30 million yuan or 20 million yuan. In addition, he violated the rules by privately accepting a deposit of 10 million yuan from the supply department of the garrison headquarters, issuing his own IOU, and withdrawing it ten days later with the IOU.

In April of this year, Sun remitted 31 taels of gold to Changzhou, and after weighing, it was short by 0.2858 taels, which he embezzled. When remitting funds to Wuxi, he ate and drank lavishly, and over-reported travel expenses by 100,000 yuan and food expenses by 10,000 yuan, embezzling a total of 110,000 yuan. He embezzled 14,000 yuan for buying a *huqin* (Chinese fiddle) for the club. In May, the business treasury was short 500,000 yuan (because Sun had accumulated it through petty cash spending). Eleven spindles of cotton yarn under his custody were missing. The 170,000 yuan of funds recovered from the missing seal labels were not promptly put into the treasury, but used as his personal temporary revolving fund.

Recently, a case of 2 million yuan theft occurred, showing that his degenerate behavior had reached its most serious level. On May 19, the branch established a treasury custody point to conduct an inventory of the warehouse, separating business from the custody point. At about 4:00 p.m. that day, cashier Comrade Du Yilei found that the iron gate of the vault was locked, but the outer iron door was not. Upon entering the vault, 5,000 yuan of new banknotes were missing. Upon investigation, it was found that Sun Chengyi was responsible, and after questioning and education by the Public Security Bureau, Sun confessed to the theft of 2 million yuan. Except for the 950,000 yuan that was recovered, the rest had been spent. After the entire case was investigated, the branch's administrative meeting announced the dismissal of Sun Chengyi and handed him over to the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau to request the government to handle it according to law.

　　人民银行江阴支行孙承毅
    贪污腐化盗窃国家财产受处分编辑同志：
    中国人民银行江苏省江阴支行出纳股长孙承毅贪污、腐化、盗窃国家财产。事实经过如下：
    孙承毅本人为学生出身，家庭为贫农成份，是山东丰南县人。他自一九四五年参加革命工作以来，即在银行做出纳工作。一九四九年随军渡江南下。他自进入城市后，经不起城市的复杂环境的考验，日渐走上贪污腐化的道路。
    去年他认识了名叫江佩霞的一个女人（该人曾在国民党时代做检查员兼文书，并参加反共情报员），并经江佩霞的介绍认识了她的妹妹江文瑞（年十八岁，现在一家纱厂做工，是个青年团员）。孙曾向领导介绍江文瑞来银行工作，行方因不了解江的情况，拒绝了。
    不久，孙与江文瑞的关系日益亲密起来，并与她发生了肉体关系。孙承毅某次去无锡解款，曾带江文瑞母女二人同行，沿途挥霍，买东西送给江家。孙并且经常到江家大吃大喝，或买东西招待江家母女。
    孙承毅平时对工作极不负责，不遵守工作制度，不签到，工作时在外面乱跑。有数次收进之支票及封签缺数，收回之现钞随意乱放在抽屉或衣袋里。他曾将交库黄金戒子戴在自己手上，把政府交来的白银五斤十二两及税务局交来之黄金，都由孙出白条，未登记在实物账上。同时，私自动支库款：三月份私自借给要塞司令部汽车队副队长现款五十万元（据他自己反省两次共借给二百万元），借给建中公司三次，每次三千万元二千万元不等。此外，违反制度，私人收要塞司令部供给处一千万元存款，由孙自出白条，十日后凭白条提出。
    今年四月份孙解黄金三十一两去常州，秤后短二钱八分五厘八，被他贪污了。去无锡解款，大吃大喝，回行多报车费十万元，又多报伙食费一万元，共贪污十一万元。为俱乐部买胡琴一只，贪污了一万四千元；五月份业务库短五十万元（因为孙平日零取花用累积而成）。由他经手保管的棉纱，短了十一支。对缺额封签追补回来的款项十七万元，不及时入库，作为他个人临时的机动金使用。
    最近又发生了一件二百万元失窃案，表现了他的堕落行为发展到最严重的程度。五月十九日，该行成立支行库保管点，进行清查库存，将业务与保管点分开。当日下午四时许，出纳员杜一雷同志发现库房铁栅门锁着，外大铁门却没锁。到库内一看，五千元的新钞票不见了。一查，少了二百万元。后经多方追查，查出为孙承毅所为，并经过公安局的追问与教育，孙已将偷窃二百万元行为坦白出来，除追回九十五万元外，其余已全部用光。全案调查清楚后，在该支行行务会议上已宣布予孙承毅以撤职处分，交公安局司法科呈请政府依法处理。
