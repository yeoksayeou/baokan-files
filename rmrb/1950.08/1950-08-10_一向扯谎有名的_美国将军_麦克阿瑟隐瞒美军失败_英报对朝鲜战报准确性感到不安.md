Xinhua News Agency, Dispatch from London, August 9th: British newspapers are increasingly uneasy about the accuracy of the war reports from Korea issued by MacArthur. The military correspondent for the London *Sunday Times* wrote that the casualty lists officially acknowledged by the United States, which do not correspond to the accounts of fierce fighting and American failures from various sources, have been subjected to "sharp criticism."

The correspondent pointed out that MacArthur has not released any casualty figures for three weeks. He said, "Judging from the consistency of reports from reliable journalists, it can be inferred that American casualties are much higher than the official figures that have been given." As is well known, MacArthur's notoriously inaccurate and deceitful communiques were a laughingstock in the Pacific theater during the last war.

　　一向扯谎有名的“美国将军”
    麦克阿瑟隐瞒美军失败
    英报对朝鲜战报准确性感到不安
    【新华社九日讯】电通社伦敦七日讯：英国报纸对麦克阿瑟所发表的朝鲜战报的准确性日益增加不安。伦敦《星期泰晤士报》军事记者写道：美国官方所承认的伤亡名单，与来自各方面的关于激战和美国失败的记载的不相符合，已受到“尖锐的抨击”。
    记者指出：麦克阿瑟已有三个星期没有发表任何伤亡数字。他说：“从那些可靠的记者们的报道的一致性看来，必定可以推断，美国伤亡数字会比官方所曾经提出的要高得多”。如所周知，麦克阿瑟公报有名的不准确和扯谎，曾成为上次大战中太平洋地区的笑料。
