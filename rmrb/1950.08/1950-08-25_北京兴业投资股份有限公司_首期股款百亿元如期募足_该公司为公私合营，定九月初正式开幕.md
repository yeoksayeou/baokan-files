　　北京兴业投资股份有限公司
    首期股款百亿元如期募足
    该公司为公私合营，定九月初正式开幕
    【新华社二十三日讯】北京市兴业投资股份有限公司已筹备就绪，定九月初正式开幕。这是全国第一个公私合营的投资公司。该公司资本总额为人民币二百亿元，其中百分之三十为公股，由中国人民银行北京分行认交。所有公私股款均分两期募集，第一期股款一百亿元自上月二十日开始募集，已于本月二十日如期募足。
    该公司设立的目的在于集中社会游资投向生产。目前工商业需要充实长期资金，而工商业中急待转业的一部分的和归国侨胞的资金又都迫切需要出路，因此投资公司即可在投资者与企业之间起桥梁作用。该公司营业范围有以下五项：（一）有利于国计民生的工矿交通公用事业之投资；（二）承受工矿交通公用事业之公司债；（三）代募或承募前项企业发行之股票或公司债；（四）保管前项企业之还债基金并代理发付股息及债券本息；（五）呈准政府代理有价证券买卖。
    该公司在成立初期准备作以下两种投资：一种是对现有的生产事业投资，以京市现有工矿业合于投资条件者为对象；另一种是发起举办京市尚未建立的有利于国计民生且合于投资条件的工业。
    该公司以股东会为最高机关。股东表决权定每五十股（每股十万元）为一权。股票为记名式，得依法买卖、转让或抵押。股东对公司的责任，以缴清其所认购的股份金额为限。公司每年度终了决算一次，分配盈余。为保障投资人的利益，在开业三年内每年度决算所得盈余如不足股息或竟无盈余时，由公司先行垫发六厘股息，于获利年度在盈余分配前尽先归垫。
