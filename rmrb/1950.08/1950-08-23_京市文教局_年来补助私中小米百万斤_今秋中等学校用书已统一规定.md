    Subsidizes Private Primary and Secondary Schools with One Million Jin of Millet Annually

    Unified Regulations for Secondary School Textbooks This Autumn

    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: Over the past year, in addition to "strengthening leadership and gradually transforming" private secondary schools, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education has also subsidized them with more than 1,117,000 jin of millet, according to the "Provisional Measures for Subsidizing Private Schools."

    In the first semester of 1949, the Bureau of Education subsidized 31 private middle schools (accounting for 46% of all private schools) with a total of 500,000 jin of millet; in the second semester, it subsidized 32 schools (accounting for 56% of private schools) with a total of 637,100 jin of millet, and also subsidized real estate tax of more than 157,000 jin. The subsidies were mostly used by the schools to increase the number of classes, purchase physics and chemistry instruments, books and equipment, and repair buildings.

    The various private middle schools generally responded well to the Bureau of Education's subsidy measures, and improved their enthusiasm for running schools, and increased their confidence in transforming the schools.

    [Another dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education has unified the decision on textbooks for middle schools and reference books for normal schools this autumn.

    In the past, the textbooks used by various schools were inconsistent. Some of these textbooks were very old, and even had errors in viewpoints; some textbooks contained too much material; some textbooks were not sufficiently integrated with practice. In addition, the versions used by various schools were not uniform, which caused difficulties in supply. Most of the secondary school textbooks that Beijing has determined to use this time were published or revised after liberation, with those published by Xinhua Bookstore being the most numerous. The Ministry of Education also has "Outlines for Streamlining Teaching Materials" for each subject, which can be used as the standard for streamlining teaching materials when teaching each subject.

　　京市文教局
    年来补助私中小米百万斤
    今秋中等学校用书已统一规定
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：一年来，京市文教局对私立中等学校除“加强领导，逐步改造”外，并根据“私立学校经费补助暂行办法”，补助了小米一百十一万七千余斤。
    一九四九年度上学期，文教局补助了私立中学三十一校（占私校全数的百分之四十六），共小米五十万斤；下学期又补助了三十二校（占私校百分之五十六），共小米六十三万七千一百斤，另补助房地产税十五万七千余斤。各校补助费多用于增加班次，购置理化仪器图书设备，及修缮房屋等方面。
    各私立中学对文教局的补助办法普遍反映良好，并提高了办学校的情绪，增加了改造学校的信心。
    【又讯】京市文教局已统一决定今年秋季中学教科用书和师范学校参考书。
    过去各校采用教科书不一致。其中有些课本教材很旧，甚至发生观点上的错误；有些课本材料太繁；有些教材与实际结合不够。加上各校采用版本不一律，供应也发生困难。这次京市确定采用的中学教科书中，大部分是解放以后出版或经过修订的，其中以新华书店出版的为最多。教育部并有各科“教材精简纲要”可作为各科教学时教材精简的标准。
