　　Commemorating "August 15th," We Thank the Soviet Red Army

    The fifth anniversary of the Japanese imperialist surrender has arrived. Compared to five years ago, everything is different.

    Our Shenyang Machine Factory No. 3 was bombed by the Kuomintang with American planes in the early days of liberation, leaving it in ruins. At that time, many people said, "Without American materials, the Communist Party will not be able to run the factory well!" However, facts have proven that the Communist Party did not use any American materials, and the factory was not only improved but also expanded. At the time of liberation, the No. 3 Factory had only over seventy workers engaged in the work of restoring the factory. Although difficulties were encountered every day, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the help of Soviet friends, the difficulties were completely overcome, and the factory achieved great development. In 1949, the No. 3 Factory planned to produce boxcar lathes, but due to the lack of spiral milling machines and grinders, as well as the low technical level of the workers, the boxcar lathes were not made, and only some old-fashioned belt lathes were produced. However, after the signing of the Sino-Soviet trade and barter agreement, a large number of exquisite broaching, planing, rotary grinding machines, etc., were shipped from the Soviet Union, and the technical level of the workers was greatly improved after the new record movement. We can now produce standard boxcar lathes. The factory has also grown from over seventy workers to over two thousand eight hundred workers, showing a brand-new atmosphere. As soon as we enter the gate, we can see countless smiling portraits of labor heroes hanging on the honor roll. Before work in each workshop, technicians hold chalk and explain technical theories to the workers in front of the blackboard. The young male and female apprentices arrive earlier than anyone else every day, sweeping the workshop floor clean. When the veteran workers arrive, they are very happy, and the old hands go into action, one doing the work of two on the brand-new, shiny lathes. Moreover, the People's Government's care for us is meticulous. In the first quarter, the factory used a large amount of funds to open apprentice training classes, training hundreds of apprentices in a semi-work, semi-study method, allowing them to directly participate in production. At the same time, the factory also helped us establish welfare organizations such as staff and worker cooperatives and clinics. Even the factory built us a magnificent five-story building. It includes a canteen, dance hall, bathhouse, barber shop, rest room, and various exquisite facilities. This happy life is inseparable from the meritorious deeds of the Soviet Red Army in liberating Northeast China. We thank the Communist Party! We thank the Soviet Red Army! This time, the Party gave me the opportunity to study in the Soviet Union. I personally saw the good example of the great economic construction of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has consistently helped us, the Chinese people, and we will never let down the good intentions of the big brother. We must unite around our Soviet big brother, learn from them, complete the current production tasks, and build our own country.

    Just as we are advancing victoriously, American imperialists are trying to prevent our People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan and interfering in the internal affairs of countries such as Korea and Vietnam. Comrades, can we allow American aggressors to destroy our happy life? If they dare to hinder us, they are asking for their own destruction. It's not like before anymore. The strength of our Chinese people is really very powerful.

    Recalling the Japanese devils' invasion of Northeast China, they were catching laborers every day: using cars to catch them, going to the homes of ordinary people to catch them. Then they transported them to northern Manchuria by train. In the summer, many workers suffocated in the carriages. In 1943, my wife and brother were also caught as laborers. When they escaped back, they said: they were not given enough to eat every day, and they were beaten and scolded. They slept on the grass at night. The devils often used horse-drawn carts to transport the laborers who died of illness. The sick workers were driven to the coal mines with wooden sticks to work. When the workers were too ill to get up, the Japanese devils insisted that they had an infectious disease, lit a fire with kerosene-soaked wood, and burned them to death.

    Later, the workers thought that instead of waiting to die here, it was better to fight the Japanese devils to the death. One day, several hundred workers started to act in the middle of the night, killing the devils' sentries and escaping. But soon they were discovered by the Japanese devils, and a part of the workers were caught back, put in sacks, and beaten to death.

    Comrades, can we forget this blood feud? We, the Chinese people, must never forget it. Today, the great Chinese people's revolution has basically triumphed, and the American aggressors still want to treat China as its colony, what a daydream!

    We must do a good job in production, improve quality, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and support the Korean People's Army in defeating the American aggressors and their puppet Li Seung-man bandit gang!

　　纪念“八一五”我们感谢苏联红军
　　赵国有
    日本帝国主义投降的五周年纪念日到来了。和五年前比较起来，一切都不同了。
    我们沈阳机器三厂，解放初被国民党用美国飞机轰炸得残破不堪。当时很多人都说：“要没有美国材料，共产党就搞不好工厂！”但是，事实证明，共产党并未用一点美国材料，工厂不但被搞好了，而且更扩大了。三厂在解放时，仅有七十多工人进行恢复工厂的工作，虽然每天碰到困难，但在中国共产党的领导与苏联朋友的帮助下，将困难完全克服并使工厂获得巨大的发展。在一九四九年时，三厂计划生产闷罐车床，但因缺少螺旋铣床磨床，及工人技术水平不高，闷罐车床没造成，而只作了一些旧式皮带车床。但在中苏贸易及换货协定签订以后，由苏联大批运来精致的抽铣刨旋磨床等，而且工人们经过了新纪录运动，技术水平也获得了大大的提高。我们已可生产标准品的闷罐车床了。工厂也已由七十多工人发展到二千八百多工人，显出一番崭新的气象。一进大门，我们便可看到无数微笑着的劳动英雄的画像，悬挂在光荣榜上。每个车间，在上班前就有技术人员拿着粉笔，在黑板前给工人讲解技术理论。男女青年徒工每天来得比谁都早，把车间的地扫得干干净净。老师傅们来了，看了很高兴，就老将出马一个顶两个地在崭新闪亮的车床上工作起来。并且，人民政府对我们的关怀是无微不至的。工厂在第一季度，就用了大批经费开办了徒工训练班，以半工半读的方法训练了百来名徒工，使他们直接参加生产。同时工厂又帮助我们建立了职工合作社、医疗所等福利事业的组织。甚至，工厂还给我们建筑了一所华丽的五层大楼。其中有食堂、跳舞厅、澡塘、理发室、休息室及各种考究的设备。这种幸福的生活，是与解放东北的苏联红军的功迹分不开的。我们感谢共产党！我们感谢苏联红军！这次，党又给我到苏联学习的机会。我亲眼看到苏联的伟大经济建设的好榜样。苏联一贯的帮助我们中国人民，我们决不辜负老大哥的善意帮助。我们必须团结在苏联老大哥的周围，向她学习，完成当前的生产任务，建设我们自己的国家。
    正当我们胜利前进的时候，美国帝国主义者又想阻挡我们人民解放军解放台湾，并干涉朝鲜和越南等国的内政。同志们，我们能容许美国侵略者破坏我们的美满生活吗？要是它敢阻碍我们的话，那就是自找死路。现在可不比从前啦。咱们中国人民的力量实在强大得很。
    回忆日本鬼子侵略东北时，天天抓劳工：用汽车来抓，到老百姓家里去抓。然后用火车把他们运到北满。在夏天的时候，许多工人就在车厢里被闷死了。一九四三年，我的老婆和哥哥也被抓去当劳工。他们逃回来时说：每天吃不饱饭，挨打受骂。夜里睡在草地上。鬼子对病死的劳工，常用马车往外运。对有病的工人，则被用木棒打着赶到煤矿里去干活。工人因病重爬不起来时，日本鬼子硬说他是患了传染病，用浇上煤油的木头点着火把他烧死了。
    后来，工人们想到与其在这里等死，不如和日本鬼子拚死。一天，有几百个工人在半夜里动起手来啦，把鬼子的岗哨杀死逃走。可是不久被日本鬼子发觉了，又把一部分工人抓回去装在麻袋里，把他们活活地摔死了。
    同志们，我们能忘记这个血海深仇吗？我们中国人民是决不能忘记的。今天，中国人民大革命已基本胜利，美国侵略者还想把中国当成它的殖民地，真是白天做梦！
    我们一定要搞好生产，提高质量，支援人民解放军解放台湾，声援朝鲜人民军打败美国侵略者及其傀儡李承晚匪帮！
