　　The China Department Store Northeast District Company, following the instructions of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department, officially determined the commodity circulation funds for each province and city company in July this year. Since then, it has begun to change the past "Great Supply System" thinking, strengthened economic accounting, improved management methods, and overcome blindness in its work. As of mid-August, the Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, and Songjiang provincial companies had allocated circulation funds to city and county units according to actual needs. Due to the change in management methods, coupled with the state's continued purchase of surplus grain from farmers, which increased farmers' purchasing power, the operations of provincial, city, and county companies have become more active. For example, in Songjiang Province, the daily average sales of department stores in various regions increased from 3 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) in early July to an average of 8 billion yuan since August.

    According to the experience of various regions over the past month, determining commodity circulation funds for the department store system has played a decisive role in changing management methods.

    First, in terms of business philosophy, the determination of funds has further enhanced the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of cadres at all levels, initially overcoming the "Great Supply System" mentality. This is reflected in the active research of cadres at all levels on new management methods. For example, the Shenyang City Department Store merged the purchasing and sales work into the business department, implementing a combination of purchasing and sales, avoiding the phenomenon of separation between purchasing and sales in the past. When provinces and cities requested goods from the district company, and city and county companies requested goods from the provincial company, they also paid attention to basing their requests on actual needs and plans, overcoming the blind allocation phenomenon of "whatever the higher level allocates, the lower level sells" in the past.

    Secondly, overall planning was initially realized. Due to the determination of funds, provincial and county companies began to take the initiative in their business, increasing purchasing work, and making the combination of state-owned trade and local public-private enterprises more extensive. According to the materials of fourteen county department stores in Songjiang Province, the amount of processing and ordering reached 68.4 billion yuan. The proportion of orders placed with private enterprises has also gradually increased. In individual cities and counties in Jilin Province, processing orders placed with private enterprises accounted for 15 percent of all commodity sources.

    In particular, business has expanded significantly after the implementation of wholesale-retail price differences and the purchase of surplus grain from farmers. For example, the total sales amount in Liaodong Province increased from 12 billion yuan per day in early August to 19 billion yuan on the 9th. The sales amount of the Tai'an County Company in July increased by 10.4 percent compared to June. Various regions have also paid attention to wholesale to private merchants, and private merchants have expressed their support. For example, merchants in some county towns in Songjiang reflected: "It is profitable to wholesale goods from department stores, and we no longer need to go to Harbin to buy goods."

    Furthermore, economic accounting has been strengthened. As a result of determining funds for provincial and city companies, attention has begun to be paid to quota management of expenditures, and some cities and counties have already achieved results in actual work. As a result of reducing expenditures in terms of business expenses, the Changbei County Company in Liaoxi Province achieved the same sales in July as in June, but expenditures were reduced by one-third, saving the state nearly 30 million yuan. At the same time, unnecessary credit and inventory backlogs to cooperatives were also reduced.

    After the initial improvement of management methods, the speed of commodity circulation has also accelerated. Although July is a slow month for commerce, according to preliminary statistics from various provinces and cities, 23.2 percent of the sales plan for the third quarter has been completed, with Liaoxi being the highest, approaching one-third of the entire quarter. According to the sales situation in early August, it is estimated that the entire quarter's plan can be completed conditionally.

    Although the Northeast department store system has achieved the above results due to the determination of funds, new problems have also arisen in the work, which must be promptly grasped and corrected. These new problems are: First, some units have neglected the promotion of state-owned industrial products, showing a task-oriented view that simply starts from the number of capital turnover. It should be affirmed that promoting state-owned industrial products is one of the main tasks of state-owned trade. In addition to actively improving the methods of promoting state-owned industrial products, suggestions for improving quality should also be put forward so that state-owned industrial products can gradually adapt to the needs of the broad masses of people and expand the sales market. Secondly, we must oppose the "go it alone" mentality and advocate that all units be fully responsible for their work, which does not mean encouraging all units to operate absolutely independently. Thirdly, it is necessary to implement overall planning, arranging state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and private enterprises in appropriate positions to ensure the leading role of state-owned enterprises. Finally, the overall economic accounting ideology should be clearly established, and adjustments should be made based on the specific conditions of each region to accelerate capital turnover and eliminate commodity backlogs.

### 东北百货公司系统确定资金  经营思想开始转变  盲目分拨逐渐克服，经济核算已在加强

　　东北百货公司系统确定资金
    经营思想开始转变
    盲目分拨逐渐克服，经济核算已在加强
    【本报讯】中国百货公司东北区公司，根据东北人民政府贸易部指示，自今年七月正式确定各省市公司商品流转资金后，开始转变了过去大供给制思想，加强了经济核算，改进了经营方法，克服了工作上的盲目性。截至八月中旬为止，辽东、辽西、吉林、松江等省公司已将流转资金按实际需要分别确定到市县单位。由于经营方法的转变，与国家继续收购农民余粮，提高了农民购买力，省及市县公司的经营皆趋于活跃。如松江省各地百货公司，由七月上旬每天平均销货三十亿元（东北币，下同），到八月以来每天平均销货已达八十亿元。
    根据一个多月来各地经验证明：百货系统确定商品流转资金，对于转变经营方法是起了决定性的作用。
    首先，在经营思想上，由于确定资金，进一步提高了各级干部的积极性与责任观念，初步克服了大供给制思想，表现在各级干部积极研究新的经营方式。如沈阳市百货公司将采购工作与推销工作合并到业务部，实行购销结合，避免了过去采销脱节的现象。在各省市向区公司要货，及市县公司向省公司要货时，亦注意了根据实际需要与计划进行，克服了过去上级拨啥、下级卖啥的盲目分拨现象。
    其次是初步实现了统筹兼顾。由于确定资金，省县公司业务开始作到主动，增加了采购工作，使国营贸易与地方公私企业的结合更形广泛。根据松江省十四县百货公司的材料，加工订货款即达六八四亿元。对私营企业的订货比重亦逐渐增大。吉林省个别市县对私营企业的加工订货占全部商品来源的百分之十五。
    特别是由于执行批发零售差价及购买农民余粮后，业务显著扩大。如辽东全省卖钱额自八月初的每天一百二十亿元，到九日已增至一百九十亿元。泰安县公司七月份卖钱额比六月份增加了百分之十点四。各地并注意了对私商的批发，因而私商一致表示拥护。如松江部分县城的商人反映：“批发百货公司的货就有利钱，再不用跑到哈尔滨去买货了。”
    再就是加强了经济核算。各省市公司确定资金的结果，已开始注意开支定额，并已有部分市县在实际工作中获得成绩。辽西省昌北县公司，从业务费方面节缩开支的结果，七月份卖钱与六月份虽然相同，但开支却减低三分之一，为国家节省了将近三千万元。同时，对合作社也减少了不必要的赊货与积压。
    经营方法初步改善后，商品流转速度亦已变快。虽然七月份是商业的淡月，但根据各省市初步材料统计，已完成第三季度卖钱计划的百分之二十三点二，其中以辽西为最多，接近完成全季度的三分之一。根据八月初的销售情况估计，全季度计划是有条件完成的。
    虽然，东北百货系统由于确定资金已获得上述成绩，但工作中也产生了新的问题，必须注意及时掌握和纠正。这些新的问题是：首先有些单位忽略了对国营工业产品的推销工作，表现单纯从资金周转次数出发的任务观点。应肯定推销国营工业产品是国营贸易主要任务之一，除了积极改善推销国营工业产品的方式方法外，并应提出改进质量的意见，使国营工业产品能日渐适应广大人民的需要，扩大销售市场。其次，要反对“单干”思想，提倡各单位全盘对工作负责，并不等于鼓励各单位绝对独立经营。再次，就是要贯彻统筹兼顾，将国家企业，合作社，私人企业，按排到适当的地位，保证国家企业的领导作用。最后应明确树立整体的经济核算思想，根据各地区具体情况进行调剂，以加速资金周转，消除商品积压。
