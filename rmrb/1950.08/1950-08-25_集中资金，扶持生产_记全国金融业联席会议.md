Centralized Funds to Support Production
    ——A Record of the National Financial Industry Joint Conference
    By Our Correspondent Lu Chaoqi
    Representatives from public and private banks and financial institutions, employee representatives, and representatives from the Federation of Industry and Commerce, who attended and were present at the National Financial Industry Joint Conference held from August 1st to 10th, studied the adjustment of relations between the financial industry and industry and commerce, the adjustment of public-private relations within the financial industry, and the adjustment of labor-management relations within the financial industry, based on the current situation of stabilizing currency and prices and the Central People's Government's general policy of adjusting industry and commerce, and reached common understanding and agreements. Regarding the relationship between the financial industry and industry and commerce, the conference believes that the task of the financial industry is to support industry and commerce in order to achieve the goals of developing production and prospering the economy. Private banks and financial institutions should strengthen their service spirit and establish extensive connections with industry and commerce; change their past bias of starting from a purely profit-oriented perspective, and shift to deeply understanding the financial plans of industrial and commercial loan customers in order to provide appropriate assistance and supervise their production to ensure the proper use of loans. The conference also deeply reviewed the past undesirable practices of banks and financial institutions, believing that it is necessary to completely abandon the past profit-grabbing business thinking and that employees should not be nostalgic for the operating methods during the period of currency inflation; earnestly rectify organizations, develop business, streamline and save, and change their style. Regarding the public-private relationship in the financial industry, after discussion, it was believed that the development of China's financial industry has not yet adapted to the needs of the entire social and economic development, and it is still necessary to unite public and private financial forces and seek common development on the basis of supporting production in order to meet the needs of national economic development. Private banks and financial institutions should unite and develop business together under the guidance of state banks. State banks can provide necessary support to private banks and financial institutions in the process of supporting industry and commerce. However, private banks and financial institutions must eliminate the idea of relying on state banks and strive for self-reliance and self-development. Based on the above common understanding, the business issues of banks and financial institutions, the joint operation and merger of banking and financial industries, and the advocacy and organization of investment companies were discussed item by item, and national banking and financial industry management methods were drafted. Finally, the following common opinions were reached:

    I. Opinions on Common Development of Business
    (A) Deposits
    In order to widely gather all the funds in society that can be concentrated to support production, it is necessary to mobilize the strength of all public and private banks and financial institutions to vigorously develop deposit business. Strive to cooperate and strengthen contacts. In the past, a small number of personnel in state-owned banks and financial institutions, and between financial institutions, used improper methods to compete for depositors, which should be corrected. Improve service efficiency, expand and strengthen relations with industry and commerce. Widely develop new business accounts in order to complete the common task of accumulating funds.

    1. Regarding the types of deposits offered by banks and financial institutions, general private banks and financial institutions can handle various deposits offered by state banks, but certain special deposits, such as savings deposits, require certain conditions to be handled after approval by state banks or entrusted by state banks.

    2. Regarding the issue of re-deposits, the various deposits absorbed by financial institutions should in principle be actively used and directly invested in production, but in special circumstances, they can be re-deposited with state banks. As for the re-deposit interest rate, it will be determined by the state bank based on the situation.

    3. Regarding the issue of abolishing various deposit methods, the role of real value deposits has gradually disappeared in recent months, and the remaining amount is also extremely limited. In fact, the masses voluntarily canceled this deposit method, and depositors should be allowed to voluntarily switch to other deposits. At present, principal-protected and value-guaranteed deposits are still needed by the people and will be temporarily retained. The abolition can be considered in the future. Fixed-flexible deposits are difficult to estimate cash positions and use funds, and can be improved by extending the term and reducing interest.

    4. Regarding pre-war deposits (including pre-war employee savings of banks and financial institutions), the conference believes that there should be a reasonable solution. In principle, it is necessary to appropriately take into account the interests of depositors and estimate the actual financial strength of the financial institutions. All head offices are required to submit specific information and solutions in the short term, establish research groups in major cities, propose solutions, and make suggestions to the government. The aim is to appropriately resolve this long-standing issue and facilitate the development of savings business in the future.

    (B) Loans

    The main purpose of loans is to support industry and commerce and develop production. Therefore, it is necessary to fully utilize the financial resources that the financial industry can mobilize and organize, and meet the requirements of industry and commerce as much as possible in accordance with reasonable loan conditions. At present, the backlog of industrial and commercial products has gradually been eliminated, the market is becoming active, and the credit stagnation has gradually passed; especially after the autumn harvest, bank and financial institution loans will have the possibility of progress. Public and private banks and financial institutions should pay equal attention to various long-term and short-term loans, and should not make rigid divisions on the term. At present, most general loans are short-term, and efforts should be gradually made to extend them to adapt to industrial turnover. For large loans, joint loans should be used and handled in parts, while small loans should still be handled according to the principle of voluntariness. In order to strengthen the planning of loans, state banks should also help financial institutions to study the focus and direction of loans as much as possible, and gradually expand their business on the existing basis of joint loans. For the use of loans, it is necessary to check at any time with the assistance of the Federation of Industry and Commerce to ensure the completion of the production plan.

    The organization of credit investigation agencies is necessary. People's banks should form unified credit investigation bureaus in various regions together with financial institutions and relevant agencies, establish contact with each other, provide and exchange investigation materials, and public and private financial institutions should exchange information and cooperate.

    1. Regarding the issue of factory building mortgage, although factory buildings and machinery generally do not meet the requirements of bank and financial institution loan collateral, in order to actively assist production, individual manufacturers that meet the following conditions can be accepted as appropriate: (1) productive enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood; (2) those with good labor-management relations; (3) those with internal streamlining and savings; (4) those with marketable products; (5) those that can ensure production at cost. At the same time, during the loan period, the financial industry can participate in management and supervise the use of funds if necessary.

    2. In principle, a guarantor is required for mortgage loans, but each bank can handle it at its discretion.

    3. Various loans can be handled separately according to their nature and conditions:

    (1) Agricultural loans – Financial institutions can handle them. It would be better if they can closely contact state banks and plan as a whole.

    (2) Industrial production and sales loans – In order to assist manufacturers in production and sales, mortgage loans (collateral can include raw materials, finished products, and semi-finished products) can be made before the finished products are sold, and finished products can be transferred to export financing during transportation and sales. This will make the factory's funds flexible and allow it to concentrate on production. This type of loan has a high guarantee and a short term. As long as the finished products are easy to sell, all banks and financial institutions are happy to undertake it under the conditions of available funds.

    (3) Industrial construction loans – Fixed assets such as factory machinery and equipment can be used as collateral, but only for major repairs, renovations, and the addition of machinery and equipment. The purpose is to maintain and increase productivity. Attention should still be paid to its intended use plan, turnover period, and credit and use.

    (4) Transportation loans – Shipping and transportation industries with ships and trucks can also be granted loans.

    (5) Commercial loans – Should be assisted in commercial transportation and sales by means of packaging and export financing, acceptance of bills of exchange, etc.

    (6) Old customer (merchant) loans – Loans should be granted to those who can provide proof of business and truly serve the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. However, loans will not be granted to single-person peddlers.

    (7) Loans to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises – Handled according to general loans.

    4. Regarding loan methods, emphasis should be placed on promoting mortgage loans, acceptance of bills of exchange, and inter-port export financing. Credit overdrafts are difficult to control and should be reduced. Furthermore, expanding credit overdrafts should not be used as a means to attract deposits.

    5. Developing warehouse business in conjunction with loans is necessary. It is hoped that in various regions, under the advocacy of the State Bank, banks and financial institutions will be encouraged to jointly operate warehouses, issue unified warehouse receipts, stipulate consistent warehouse rents, and formulate standard management methods. This will not only develop the warehouse business, but also benefit the management of materials, assistance in transportation and sales, and financing.

    6. The State Bank handles re-pledge and rediscount in order to encourage banks and financial institutions to more fully utilize their financial resources, support industry and commerce, and assist them in solving turnover difficulties. The main principles are as follows:

    (1) The loan targets are limited to production enterprises and urban and rural trade enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood.

    (2) The loan use should be one of the following: (1) the commodity has already been produced, but the goods have not yet been sold, and need turnover funds; (2) the purchase of necessary raw materials, fuels, and production equipment; (3) operating funds required for the acquisition of export materials and their sorting and processing; (4) operating funds required for transportation and sales enterprises that are beneficial to urban-rural exchanges.

    (3) To apply for re-pledge and rediscount, the original collateral, together with the insurance policy and relevant vouchers, must be transferred to the State Bank. The original collateral should also meet the following conditions: (1) to apply for re-pledge, the collateral must generally be easily sold commodities such as raw materials, manufactured products, or semi-manufactured products, and warehouse receipts of business warehouses and qualified factories; (2) to apply for rediscount, generally only bank acceptance bills with commercial transaction certificates are accepted, and warehouse receipts of business warehouses and qualified factories must be attached as collateral.

    (4) When applying for re-pledge and rediscount, the original loan contract must stipulate the words "this claim may be transferred."

    (5) The amount of re-pledge and rediscount shall not exceed the amount of the original loan. The interest rate is generally calculated according to the original loan interest rate, but may still be adjusted according to the market situation and the degree to which the original loan is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. The term generally shall not exceed 30 days.

    7. For the work of actively collecting bad debts, appropriate institutions (such as bad debt clearing committees) should be organized in places with many bad debts, and relevant agencies such as the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the General Trade Union should jointly participate in discussions on how to actively collect and handle them. If an individual bank or financial institution has too many bad debts, the State Bank can consider helping to solve its difficulties through different methods.

    8. Regarding the issue of shareholder advances in industrial and commercial enterprises, in order to take care of the current difficulties of industrial and commercial enterprises and the private lending in small and medium-sized cities that has yet to be developed, it may still be temporarily allowed to continue. It is suggested that Shanghai consider whether the following principles can be adopted for appropriate management:

    (1) Register with the local People's Bank; (2) The source of funds is limited to the shareholders and employees of the factory; (3) Pay interest at the prescribed interest rate for banks and financial institutions; (4) The advance should be of a fixed-term nature and should not be deposited and withdrawn at any time; (5) Prepare and submit monthly reports to the local People's Bank.

    9. Regarding joint lending, in recent months, its favorable role in concentrating funds, consolidating credit, and expanding the ability to support production has inspired us that this is a good way for banks and financial institutions to lend. We should strive for further consolidation and development in the future. After discussion, the meeting agreed to the following principles:

    (1) The State Bank actively participates in leading the organization and expansion of joint lending institutions in various regions, with the participation of all public and private banks and financial institutions, and representatives of the industrial and commercial authorities and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should participate.

    (2) The focus of joint lending should be on longer-term and large loans, and planned attention should also be given to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood.

    (3) Joint lending is the central institution for lending. When there are large loans and insufficient funds, the joint lending office will handle them separately with public and private banks and financial institutions. When public and private banks and financial institutions have loans that meet the conditions for joint lending, they can also handle them jointly with the joint lending office.

    (4) The composition of joint lending funds is divided into two items: fixed funds and temporary sharing.

    (5) Joint lending should be planned and should be coordinated with the business plans of the loan recipients.

    (6) Strengthen pre-investigation and post-inspection, and establish a credit investigation system to fully collect investigation data.

    (C) Remittance

    At present, the allocation of social funds does not go through bank and financial institution remittances. In order to vigorously develop the remittance business, efforts should be made to reduce remittance rates and simplify procedures. Furthermore, methods such as purchasing certificates and letters of credit should be used as much as possible to develop export financing to facilitate the turnover of funds between ports.

    1. In order to promote the development of the remittance business, the State Bank will provide convenience to banks and financial institutions in the proper allocation of remittance cash positions under available funds, and will handle it according to the low exchange rate discount (30% discount) that the State Bank gives to general depositors. The State Bank and financial institutions should, in principle, treat customers equally. This is not limited to customers with special business contacts (such as interest-free transfer of deposits without fees, etc.).

    2. Regarding exchange rates, the general policy is low prices and more remittances. It is best for public and private bank and financial institution exchange rates to be consistent, but it is not necessary to make rigid regulations. If abnormal conditions occur in the financial market, the State Bank can use discretion and flexibility.

    3. Regarding the commercial purchase of foreign exchange business, in some areas, it still helps urban-rural exchanges and capital turnover. Banks and financial institutions should consider its use and customer credit, handle it cautiously, and limit it to immediate exchange. However, export financing should be gradually promoted to replace it.

    4. The State Bank should lead the establishment of a remittance market in major cities, manage it, and prevent speculation.

    (D) Interest Rate

    1. Interest rates should tend to decrease: interest is part of the profits of industry and commerce. In order to effectively support industry and commerce and develop production, the regulations on interest rates should be coordinated with the general profits of industry and commerce. The previous high interest rates were caused by currency inflation. Now that the financial situation has begun to improve, a decrease in interest rates is appropriate and necessary. The low-interest policy adopted with currency stabilization is correct. We unanimously agree that interest rates should continue to decline and hope to gradually approach pre-war levels. However, at present, the price situation and the profits of industry and commerce are not yet very normal, the development of the financial industry is relatively slow, and the increase in deposits is gradual, so it is advocated to take gradual steps, and gradually, flexibly, and with a certain range, adjust interest rates to pre-war levels depending on the supply and demand of funds and the trend of prices.

    To encourage savings, the interest rate on long-term, small-amount savings deposits should be slightly higher than the interest rate on general deposits.

    2. The narrowing of the interest rate spread is a definite direction. On the one hand, in order to absorb idle funds and gather funds, and on the other hand, in order to cooperate with the needs of industry and commerce and enable industry and commerce to bear it, we believe that the interest rate spread between deposits and loans should be gradually narrowed in a natural trend. The financial industry should strive to streamline and save, and should try to adopt a small profit and quick turnover approach, expand the deposit base, and attract new depositors, so that the total amount of deposits under its control will increase, so that the narrowing of the interest rate spread can be easily realized.

    3. Interest rates for public and private banks and financial institutions should be generally consistent. If necessary in individual regions, the deposit and loan interest rates of state-owned banks and private financial institutions may be slightly different. The deposit interest rates of private financial institutions in various regions should in principle be unified; however, in individual regions, if the actual business conditions of financial institutions are different and there is a need for a difference, it should be decided by the local interest rate committee through negotiation. The regulations on loan interest rates should have an appropriate range.

    Interest rates in different regions and major cities may have appropriate differences, but they should not be too large. Various regions should always pay attention to contact and coordination. Areas and cities with currently high interest rates should be gradually adjusted to be in line with Shanghai, which has lower interest rates, so that the difference in interest rates between regions will gradually narrow.

    In the future, the People's Bank of China will stipulate the maximum loan interest rate and hand it over to the local interest rate committee to formulate various deposit and loan interest rates appropriately based on the specific local situation, and the financial institutions will comply.

    4. We agree to the establishment of interest rate committees in various regions, which will be organized by representatives of the People's Bank of China, the Financial Industry Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the industrial and commercial authorities to formulate uniform interest rates. In areas where an interest rate committee has not been organized, the financial industry should consult with industry and commerce and the industrial and commercial authorities for their opinions on the proposed interest rates.

    (E) Bills

    In order to save the use of cash and develop normal social credit, the use of bills should in principle be promoted. However, at present, in order to prevent possible credit expansion, it should still be especially cautious. Therefore, the following principles have been decided:

    1. In principle, bills cannot be cashed on the same day. In order to take care of the turnover difficulties of industry and commerce, banks and financial institutions in various regions can choose reliable customers and handle it at their discretion.

    2. Banks and financial institutions shall not issue bank drafts and shall try to use People's Bank of China checks. However, regarding the use of People's Bank of China checks and the limited next-day cash position issue, the People's Bank of China can provide convenience depending on the situation in each region.

    3. Post-dated checks cannot be opened and should be replaced with acceptance bills as much as possible.

    4. The validity of checks, under the current circumstances, should be set at one month for the time being.

    (F) The State Bank Entrusts Private Banks and Financial Institutions to Act as Agents

    It is beneficial to the development of both parties' business for the State Bank to entrust private banks and financial institutions to act as agents under the principle of mutual benefit, but certain credit conditions and technical conditions are required.

    (G) Establishment of Institutions

    1. The establishment of institutions shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the management method. Since state-owned banks and private financial institutions have different establishment purposes, the state-owned bank cannot be restricted from setting up an institution simply because a private financial institution has already been set up there.

    2. The establishment of a public business office by a financial institution to handle payment services must be submitted for approval. As for handling temporary receipts or payments for specially contracted agencies and organizations without operating to the public, there is no need to submit for approval.

    3. The financial institutions left over from old China are biased towards large coastal cities and do not meet the needs of future restoration of national economic development. In addition to requesting state-owned banks to set up institutions in a planned manner, private financial institutions are also encouraged to develop business in inland small and medium-sized cities. Financial institutions can apply to set up institutions. The State Bank will study and decide after.

    (H) Other issues

    1. Regarding the realization of real estate of financial institutions, financial institutions should actively try to increase working capital, and the State Bank can help financial institutions realize real estate as much as possible.

    2. As for the mortgage of public bonds, according to the regulations of the People's Victory Real Value Public Bond Regulations, it is not allowed to mortgage loans from the State Bank. Financial institutions inherit public bond mortgages and transfer bad debts, and when handling final accounts, they have difficulties in discounting due to the lack of a legal benchmark price, and request the government to regularly announce the distribution price of public bonds.

    3. Under the principle of mutual benefit, public-private joint ventures can conduct business with financial institutions.

    II. Joint Operation, Merger, and Advocacy Organization of Banking and Financial Industries

    Joint operation and merger are good ways for the financial industry to further concentrate its strength; investment companies are good ways for the financial industry to further combine with production and should be supported and promoted.

    (A) Joint Operation

    The role of joint operation is not only to consolidate the credit of participating financial institutions, but also to promote their own transformation. It exerts collective strength in business, reduces unnecessary and blind competition, and can obtain guidance and assistance from the People's Bank of China. Existing organizations must be continuously enriched, and financial institutions that are willing to organize but have not yet organized should be promoted to organize. Shanghai and Tianjin already have a considerable foundation, and other regions should gradually organize and gradually promote. The Shanghai Joint Operation Group has the following four important regulations: (1) The institution itself has a surplus or has considerable assets or funds to compensate for losses; (2) Labor-management coordination, streamlining and savings have achieved concrete results; (3) Members must maintain a balance of income and expenditure or implement an economic accounting system; (4) Management and supervision of the quota for direct loans to members and the total amount of acceptance business. After discussion, the meeting agreed in principle to the above principles. It is also hoped that the People's Bank of China will give the joint loan made by the Joint Operation Group the same convenience of re-pledge and rediscount as the joint loan. The joint operation organization should have strict constraints.

    Joint operation business should be gradually promoted, from joint lending to other businesses, to create conditions for merger.

    (B) Merger

    In order to increase strength, improve reputation, expand the ability to support production, or overcome current difficulties, financial institutions should consider merging, or gradually move towards merger through joint operation. This is beneficial in adapting to the new economic situation, and the State Bank should encourage and assist it.

    (C) Investment Company

    The establishment of investment companies is to gather scattered funds, absorb the industrial and commercial conversion funds that are urgently seeking a way out, and the funds of overseas Chinese returning to China. The investment of funds will become long-term, which is conducive to economic construction. Through this institution, investments are planned in production undertakings related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Increase its working capital, supervise its transformation and operation, help it restore and expand production, and in the future, it may be possible to further invest in creating new enterprises.

    We unanimously agree to the establishment of investment companies and provide the following five opinions:

    1. The securities of the investment company should be easy to transfer.

    2. The capital of the investment company itself should be small to large depending on the local situation. It is hoped that the State Bank and financial institutions will advocate investment, but it should not be too focused on the funds of the State Bank. Attention should be paid to absorbing social idle funds and overseas Chinese funds.

    3. The business of the investment company should be the following: (1) Investment in production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood; (2) Underwriting or underwriting the stocks and corporate bonds of production undertakings; (3) Accepting the stocks and corporate bonds of production undertakings; (4) Grouping and issuing investment trust securities with smaller par values in installments; (5) Custody of corporate bond collateral and debt repayment funds; (6) Acting as an agent for companies to repay dividends and bond interest; (7) Acting as an agent for the transfer and transfer of securities of public-private joint ventures and private enterprises; (8) Operating and trading of stocks and corporate bonds related to production undertakings; (9) Participating in enterprise management and assisting in all improvement matters.

    4. Interest can be guaranteed for private investment shares to encourage investment.

    5. The par value of the investment company's shares should not be too large in order to widely absorb small amounts of funds from society. At the same time, registered shares and bearer shares should be used together.

    III. Opinions on Drafting National Banking and Financial Industry Management Methods

    Because the time of liberation in various regions varies, in the past, major administrative regions separately formulated interim measures for the management of private banks and financial institutions to meet the urgent needs of various regions. At that time, it had the effect of stabilizing finance, stabilizing prices, and preventing speculation. Now that the mainland of China has been liberated, the domestic financial and economic situation has begun to improve, and the private financial industry has gradually eliminated temporary difficulties, creating favorable conditions for further development. Since the interim management methods in various regions have quite inconsistent regulations on business scope, capital amount, etc., it is not only inconvenient for the competent authorities to manage, but also financial institutions feel that it is impossible to establish vertical leadership when operating their business. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a unified national banking and financial industry management method. This management method must simultaneously protect the legitimate interests of the state, industry and commerce, depositors, and financial institutions. The purpose of the management method is to consolidate the credit of financial institutions, improve the management of financial institutions, and facilitate the further development of financial institutions. Therefore, it stipulates under what conditions certain businesses can be carried out, what business activities violate policies and must be banned, and in order to consolidate the credit foundation of financial institutions and enable them to fully exert their function of absorbing social funds, the total amount of capital should be determined. The regulation of the amount of capital is a content that the management method should have. The purpose is not to increase the difficulty of financial institutions by increasing capital. The regulation on deposit reserves, in addition to serving as a guarantee for deposit debts, aims to encourage a portion of funds to be invested in investment companies and participate in joint lending. At the same time, the cash reserve is stipulated to be slightly lower to avoid stagnation or restrict the use of financial institution funds. This method can be promulgated after being reviewed by the Government Affairs Council.

    The meeting also studied the issue of adjusting labor-management relations in the financial industry. Please invite representatives from both labor and management to be convened by the Ministry of Labor to conduct discussions.

　　集中资金，扶持生产
    ——记全国金融业联席会议
    本报记者  陆超祺
    出席及列席八月一日至十日举行的全国金融业联席会议的公私营行庄代表、职工代表、工商联合会代表，根据目前通货、物价趋于稳定的情况及中央人民政府调整工商业的总方针，研究了调整金融业与工商业的关系，调整金融业中的公私关系及调整金融业中的劳资关系等问题，并获得了共同的认识和协议。关于金融业与工商业的关系，会议认为金融业的任务在于扶植工商业，以达到发展生产、繁荣经济的目的。私营行庄应加强服务精神，与工商业建立广泛联系；改变过去从单纯赢利观点出发的偏向，转变到深入了解工商业贷款户的财务计划，以便适当加以扶助，监督其生产，以保证贷款的正当用途。会议并深刻地检讨过去银行钱庄的不良作风。认为今后必须完全抛弃过去追求暴利的经营思想，从业人员不要留恋过去通货膨胀时期的经营方式；切实整顿组织，开展业务，精简节约，改变作风。对于金融业中的公私关系，经讨论后，认为中国金融业的发展，尚不能适应整个社会经济发展的需要，尚需团结公私金融力量，在扶持生产的基础上求得共同发展，才能满足国民经济发展的需要。私营行庄应在国家银行的指导下，团结起来，共同发展业务。私营行庄在扶助工商业的过程中，国家银行可予以必要的支持。但私营行庄必须消除依赖国家银行的思想，努力自力更生，自求发展。根据以上共同认识，逐项讨论行庄的业务问题、银钱业的联营、合并与投资公司的倡导与组织问题，并拟定全国性银钱业管理办法。最后取得如下共同的意见：
    一、关于共同发展业务的意见
    （甲）存款
    为了广泛聚集社会上一切可能集中的资金，以扶持生产，必须动员全部公私行庄力量，大力开展存款业务。努力合作，加强联系。过去国行与行庄之间，行庄与行庄之间少数人员采用不正当的方法，争夺存户，应予纠正。改进服务效能，扩大并密切与工商业的关系。广泛发展新的往来户，以求完成积聚资金的共同任务。
    １．关于行庄举办存款种类，国家银行所办的各种存款，一般的私营行庄都可举办，但对某些特种存款，需要一定条件方能举办，如储蓄存款之类，应经国家银行核准，或受国家银行委托办理。
    ２．关于转存款问题，行庄吸收的各种存款原则上应主动的积极的运用，直接投向生产，但在特殊情况下，可以再存款方式转存国家银行。至于转存利率，由国行根据情况决定之。
    ３．关于各种存款方式的存废问题，折实存款数月来其作用已逐渐消失，结余金额也极有限，事实上群众自动取消这种存款方式，应允许存户自愿转为其他存款。而保本保值存款，在目前仍为人民所需要，暂予保留。将来可考虑废除。定活两便存款，因头寸匡计，资金运用均感困难，可用延长期限，削减利息等方法改进之。
    ４．关于战前存款，（包括战前行庄职工储蓄）会议认为应当有一合情合理的解决，原则上既要适当顾及存款人利益，又要估计行庄实际负担力量。要求各总行庄在短期内提出具体资料及解决意见，在重要城市成立研究小组，拟议解决办法，向政府建议。期以使这一多年未决定的问题获得适当解决，并利于今后储蓄业务之开展。
    （乙）放款
    放款的主要目的在于扶持工商业，发展生产。因此必须充分运用金融业所能动员组织的资力，按照合理的放款条件，尽量满足工商业的要求。目前工商业滞销已逐步消除，市场趋于活跃，信用迟滞已渐过去；特别秋收以后，行庄放款将有进展的可能。公私行庄对于各项长短期的放款，应同样注重，不在期限上作硬性分工。现时一般放款多属短期，应逐渐争取放长，以适应工业周转。对于大额放款宜通过联放，分成办理，小额放款仍从自愿原则处理。为了加强放款计划性，国家银行并应尽量帮助行庄研究放款重点及方向。并使联放在现有基础上逐步扩大其业务，对于放款用途，必须在工商联协助之下，随时检查，以保证生产计划的完成。
    征信机构的组织是必要的，应该由人民银行，会同行庄及有关机关，在各个地区组成统一的征信所，彼此取得联系，供给及交换调查资料，公私行庄间应该互通情报，共同合作。
    １．关于厂基抵押问题，厂房机器虽一般不合行庄放款押品的要求，但为积极协助生产，对于个别厂商合乎下列条件的，可酌量接受：（１）有利国计民生的生产事业；（２）劳资关系已搞好的；（３）内部已精简节约的；（４）产品有销路的；（５）能保本生产的。同时在放款期内，如有必要可由金融业参加管理，监督用途。
    ２．抵押放款保证人原则上是需要的，但各行可酌情办理。
    ３．各种放款可按其性质和条件分别掌握办理之：
    （１）农贷——行庄均可办理，如能与国家银行密切联系，统筹计划更好。
    （２）工业产销贷款——为协助厂商产销，在成品未销售前予以叙做押款（押品可包括原料，成品，半成品），运销之时以成品转作押汇。使工厂资金灵活，可以专心生产，这种放款保障大，期限短，只要成品是易于销售的，在资力可能的条件之下，各行庄均乐于承办。
    （３）工业建设贷款——得以厂机设备等固定资产为担保，但限于大修、改造、添置机器设备。以保持增进生产力为目的。仍应注意其用途计划。周转期限，以及信用和用途。
    （４）交通事业贷款——具有船舶卡车等之航业运输业。亦得予以贷放。
    （５）商业贷款——应以打包押汇，承兑汇票等方式，协助商业运销。
    （６）老客（行商）借款——凡能提供营业证明，确为城乡物资交流服务者，应予贷放。但单帮包袱客不予贷放。
    （７）中小工商业贷款——照一般放款办理。
    ４．关于放款方式，应注重推行抵押放款。承兑汇票及埠际押汇。信用透支不易控制，应该少做，更不应以扩大信用透支作为争揽存款的手段。
    ５．配合放款，发展仓库业务是需要的，希望各地区，在国行倡导下，鼓励行庄联合经营仓库，发行统一栈单，规定一致栈租，并订定标准管理办法。这样不仅仓库业务获得发展，同时于管理物资，扶助运销和融通资金都有裨益。
    ６．国家银行办理转质押，重贴现，目的在于鼓励行庄更充分运用其资力，扶持工商业，协助其解决周转困难。其主要原则如下：
    （一）放款对象限于有利于国计民生之生产事业及城乡内外贸易事业。
    （二）放款用途应为下列各点之一：（１）商品业已出厂，而货物尚未脱售，需周转资金者；（２）必要之原料燃料及生产器材之购置；（３）收购出口物资及其整理加工所需之营运资金；（４）有利城乡交流的运销事业所需之营运资金。
    （三）申请办理转质押重贴现，必须将原押品连同保险单及有关凭证全部移转国家银行，其原押品并应具备下列条件：（１）办理转质押，其押品一般须为易于出售之商品如原料，制成品或半制成品之营业仓库及合格工厂之栈单作押；（２）办理重贴现，一般的以具有商业行为证件之银行承兑汇票为限，并须附有营业仓库及合格工厂之栈单作押。
    （四）申请办理转质押重贴现，其原借款契约内，必须订明“该项债权得予转让”字样。
    （五）转质押重贴现之数额，最高以不超过原放款金额为度，利率一般按原放款利率计算，仍可根据市场情况及原放款对国计民生之有利程度酌予伸缩。期限一般不得超过三十天。
    ７．对于积极催收呆帐的工作，在呆帐多的地方应组织适当机构（如呆帐清理委员会），由工商局，工商联，总工会等有关机关，共同参加讨论如何积极催收处理。个别行庄呆帐过多，国行可考虑通过不同方式，帮助解决其困难。
    ８．关于工商业中股东垫款问题，为照顾目前工商业的困难及中小城市之私人借贷尚待开展，仍可暂允其继续办理。建议上海方面，考虑是否可以采取下列原则加以适当管理：
    （１）向当地人民银行登记；（２）款项来源限于本厂股东职工；（３）照规定银钱业利率付息；（４）垫款应照定期性质，不得随时存支；（５）每月造具表报，呈报当地人民银行。
    ９．关于联合放款，近月以来，在集中资金，巩固信用，扩大扶持生产能力等方面所起的有利作用，启示了我们这是行庄放款的良好途径，今后应求得更进一步的巩固与发展，会议讨论结果，同意下列诸原则：
    （１）国行积极参与领导在各地组织和扩大联放机构，公私行庄全体参加，工商主管机关及工商联应有代表参加。
    （２）联放重点应置于较长期限和巨额的贷放，对有利于国计民生的中小型工商业亦应有计划的予以照顾。
    （３）以联放为贷放的中心机构，遇有巨额放款而资金不敷时，由联放处与公私行庄分成办理，公私行庄有适合联放条件的放款时，亦可与联放处共同办理。
    （４）联放资金的构成，分固定基金与临时分成搭放两项。
    （５）联放要有计划性，并应配合放款对象的业务计划。
    （６）加强事先调查和事后检查，并应创立征信制度，充分收集调查资料。
    （丙）汇兑
    目前社会资金的调拨，尚有不通过行庄汇兑的，为了大力开展汇兑业务起见，应设法减低汇水，简捷手续。并尽量采用购买证，信用状等方式，开展押汇以利埠际资金的周转。
    １．国行为促进汇兑业务的开展，对行庄正当调拨汇兑头寸，在资力许可下给予便利，并按照国行优待一般存户的低汇率折扣（七折）办理。国行与行庄对客户优待，原则上应一律。对于客户有特殊业务联系者，不在此限（如存款无息调拨无费等）。
    ２．关于汇率，总的方针是廉价多汇。公私行庄汇率最好能趋一致，但不必作硬性规定，设遇金融市场发生不正常时，国行可酌情机动掌握。
    ３．关于商业买汇业务，在若干地区，尚有助于城乡交流及资金周转，行庄应考虑其用途及客户信用，慎重办理，并以即期为限。但仍应逐渐推行押汇代替之。
    ４．各主要城市应由国行领导建立汇兑市场，加以管理，防止投机。
    （丁）利率
    １．利率应趋向下降：利息是工商业利润的一部分。为切实扶助工商业，发展生产，利率的规定应当配合一般工商业的利润。以前的高额利率是通货膨胀造成的，现在财经状况开始好转，利率的下降是应当和必需的。随通货稳定而采取的低利政策是正确的。我们一致同意利率应继续下降，并且希望逐渐接近战前水平。但是，目前物价的情况，工商业的利润还没有十分正常，金融业的发展比较缓慢，存款的增加是逐步的，所以主张采取和缓的步骤，视资金的供求，物价的趋势，逐步的、机动的、有幅度的，调整利率到战前的水平。
    为鼓励储蓄，长期的、小额的、储蓄存款利率应当比一般存款利率稍高。
    ２．利差的缩小是一定的方向。一方面为了吸收游资，聚集资金，一方面为了配合工商业的需要，使工商业有负担能力，我们认为要循自然的趋势，渐渐的把存放利差缩小。金融业应努力精简节约，并应尽可能的采取薄利多营，扩展存款面，争取新存户，使掌握的存款总额增加，以期利差缩小易于实现。
    ３．公私行庄利率，应求大体一致。各别地区，如有必要，国行与私营行庄的存放利率可略有差别。各地私营行庄的存款利率原则上应统一；但个别地区，行庄实际营业情况不同，有差别必要时，得由当地利率委员会协议决定之。放款利率的规定应有适当的幅度。
    各地区间和重要城市间的利率可有适当差别，但不宜过大，各地应经常注意联系，配合。目前利率较为突出的地区和城市应逐渐调整，向利率较低之上海看齐，使各地间利率的差别逐渐缩小。
    今后由人民银行总行，规定放款利率最高额，交由各地利率委员会根据当地具体情况，适当拟订各种存放利率，行庄遵照执行。
    ４．我们同意各地成立利率委员会，由人民银行金融业同业公会，工商联合会与工商主管机关代表组织之，统一拟订利率。其未组织利率委员会的地区，应由金融业约同工商业及工商主管机关对拟订利率参加意见。
    （戊）票据
    为节省现金使用，并发展社会正常信用起见，票据的行使，原则上应予推行。但目前为防止可能的信用膨胀起见，还应特别慎重。故决定下列几项原则：
    １．票据，原则上当日不能抵现。各地行庄为照顾工商业周转困难，可选择信用可靠的户头，自行酌情办理。
    ２．行庄不得签发本票，应尽量利用国行支票。但关于国行支票的领用，及限于隔日头寸问题，可由国行视各地情况，予以便利。
    ３．迟期支票不能开放，应尽量以承兑汇票代替。
    ４．支票时效，在目前情况下，暂以一个月为宜。
    （己）国家银行委托私营行庄代理业务
    国家银行委托私营行庄代理业务，在两利两愿的原则下，是有利于双方业务之发展的，但需具备一定信用条件和技术条件。
    （庚）机构设置
    １．机构设立应根据管理办法规定办理之。国行与私营行庄因设置目的不同，不能因该处已设有私营行庄，即限制国行不设机构。
    ２．行庄设立公开营业，办理收付之服务处，须经呈请核准。至于对特约之机关团体，仅办理临时收或付而不对外营业者，自无须呈准。
    ３．旧中国所遗留的金融机构，偏在于沿海大城市，不适应今后恢复国民经济发展的需要，除请国家银行有计划设置外并鼓励私营行庄开展内地中小城市业务。行庄设置机构可以申请。由国家银行研究后决定。
    （辛）其他问题
    １．关于行庄不动产的变现问题，行庄应主动设法增加活动资金，国家银行可尽量帮助行庄的不动产变现。
    ２．至于公债的抵押，依照人民胜利折实公债条例规定，不得向国家银行抵押借款，行庄因承受公债抵转呆帐，以及办理决算，因无法定牌价为准，折价发生困难，请求政府定期公布公债分价格。
    ３．在两利两愿的原则下，公私合营企业可与行庄往来。
    二、银钱业的联营、合并与投资公司的倡导组织
    联营合并，为金融业进一步集中力量的良好方式；投资公司为金融业与生产进一步结合的良好方式，应予赞助推广。
    （甲）联营
    联营的作用，不但为巩固参加行庄的信用，并为促进其本身的改造。在业务方面发挥集体的力量，减少不必要的，盲目的竞争，并可获得人民银行的指导和帮助，已有的组织，要不断的充实，并推动愿意组织起来而还没有组织起来的行庄，进行组织。上海、天津已经有了相当基础，其他地区也应逐渐组织起来，逐步推展。上海联营集团有如下四项重要规定：（一）机构本身有盈余或有相当资产或资金抵补亏损而有余者；（二）劳资调协精简节约，已有具体成效者；（三）团员须保持收支平衡或实行经济核算制；（四）对团员直接放款每户额度及办理承兑业务总额的管理与监督。会议讨论后，原则上同意上述原则，联营集团所作的联合放款也希望人民银行比照联放，同样予以转抵押重贴现的便利，联营组织应有严格的约束。
    联营业务应逐步推进，由联放推展到其他业务，为合并创造条件。
    （乙）合并
    行庄为增加实力，提高信誉，扩大扶持生产力量，或克服目前困难，考虑合并，或经过联营，逐步走向合并，就适应新的经济情势来说，这是有利的，国家银行对此应予以鼓励和协助。
    （丙）投资公司
    投资公司的设立，为聚集游散资金，与吸收正在迫切寻求出路的工商业转业资金，以及华侨回国资金。资金投放转为长期化，有利于经济建设。通过这一机构，有计划的投资于国计民生有关的生产事业。增加其流动资金，监督其改造经营，帮助其恢复与扩大生产，将来并有可能进一步投资创立新的企业。
    我们一致同意投资公司的设立，并提供下列五项意见：
    １．投资公司的证券应有转让的便利。
    ２．投资公司本身资本，视各地情况，由小而大，希望由国行及行庄倡导投资，但也不要偏重国行的资金，宜注意吸收社会的闲散资金及华侨资金。
    ３．投资公司的业务应为下列几项：（１）有利于国计民生的生产事业的投资；（２）代募或承募生产事业之股票及公司债；（３）承受生产事业之股票与公司债；（４）分组分期发行票面金额较小的投资信托证券；（５）保管公司债押品及还债基金；（６）代理公司还付股息及债票息；（７）代理公私合营企业及私营企业证券之转让过户事宜；（８）有关生产事业之股票及公司债之经营买卖；（９）参与企业管理及协助一切改进事项。
    ４．对于私人的投资股份可予以保息，以资鼓励。
    ５．投资公司的股票，票面金额不宜过大，以便广泛吸收社会上的小额资金。同时，宜以记名股票与不记名股票并用。
    三、对于拟定全国性银钱业管理办法的意见
    因为各地区解放的时间有先后，过去各大行政区为适应各地区急迫的需要，分别订定了私营银钱业管理暂行办法。在当时曾发生了稳定金融，稳定物价，制止投机的功效。现在中国大陆上已经解放，国内财政经济状况开始好转，私营金融业也逐渐消除了暂时的困难，为进一步的发展造成有利的条件。由于各地区暂行的管理办法对业务范围，资本额………等等规定颇不一致，不但主管机关在管理上不便，而行庄在经营业务时也感觉到无法建立垂直领导的困难。因此拟订全国统一的银钱业管理办法是必要的。这个管理办法必须同时保障国家、工商业、存款人，及行庄四方面的正当利益。管理办法的目的在巩固行庄信用，健全行庄的经营，便利行庄进一步的发展。因此，规定了在怎样的条件下可以进行何种业务，什么样的业务活动是违犯政策而必须取缔的，并为巩固行庄信用基础，使其可能充分发挥吸收社会资金的功能，应确定资本总额。资本额的规定是管理办法应具的内容，目的不在于以增资增加行庄的困难。关于存款保证金的规定，除了作为存款债务的保证外，旨在鼓励一部分资金投向投资公司，及参加联放。同时规定现金准备稍低，以避免呆滞或限制行庄资金的运用。这个办法呈政务院审核后即可公布。
    会议并研究了调整金融业中的劳资关系问题。请由劳动部召集劳资双方代表，进行研讨。
