　　Zhengzhou Railway Hospital Director Exhibits Severe Bureaucratic Style
    Guo Juyi's Letter Criticizes
　　Editor:
    Recently, an incident occurred here where the railway hospital refused to treat a severely wounded soldier. The facts are as follows:
    We are a company in the technology battalion of a certain division of the Railway Corps, responsible for water supply. Recently, we were performing a water tower repair task at Yancheng Station, within the jurisdiction of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. A comrade was injured while urgently trying to complete the project, breaking his leg. The division hospital is stationed in Shijiazhuang, more than a thousand miles from Yancheng, so we had to take the wounded comrade to the Yancheng Railway Hospital for emergency treatment. However, the hospital stated that they were unable to treat him and referred us to the Zhengzhou Railway Hospital.
    Therefore, on August 1st, I took the referral letter from the Yancheng Railway Hospital and a letter of introduction from the company, and escorted the wounded comrade to the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Railway Hospital, where we first registered. Because the wounded comrade's injury was severe, I asked the doctor on duty to examine him first. They unwrapped the bandage on the injured area, took a look, and said, "The bone is broken." After waiting a long time, the hospital director finally came out. He also looked at it and said, "He needs to be hospitalized." After the wounded comrade was taken to the operating room, the hospital asked me to pay in cash first. I said, "I don't have any cash." They replied, "That won't do!" I went to the director to discuss it. The director said, "It's not possible without paying in cash; this is the regulation from higher authorities. Besides, according to regulations, we need a letter of introduction from an organization at the regimental level or above." I said, "We are just a company in Yancheng, far from the division headquarters. Could you please treat the patient first, and I will go to Shijiazhuang to get the money and a letter of introduction from a higher-level organization?" The director said, "The letter of introduction doesn't matter much, but it won't work without cash." We asked him to at least change the dressing. But the director insisted, "No money, no dressing!" I finally said, "What if this comrade dies?" The director said, "We are not responsible if he dies."
    I believe that this working style of the Zhengzhou Railway Hospital is wrong. This is not an attitude of serving the people and being responsible to the people. Especially when the wounded comrade's injury is serious, they should be given special consideration. Moreover, we have a referral letter from the Yancheng Hospital, and the patient was injured while repairing the water tower. I hope that the Zhengzhou Railway Hospital will quickly correct this bad style and improve medical work.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Guo Juyi's letter reflects the serious bureaucratic style and profit-oriented attitude of the director of the Zhengzhou Railway Hospital in handling this matter. This attitude is intolerable. Hospitals should have procedures and regulations for admitting patients, but should not use this as an excuse to refuse admission and treatment to severely ill and injured persons with practical difficulties. It is hoped that the leaders of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau will inspect the work of the hospital and correct its mistakes.

### 郑州铁路医院院长有严重官僚主义作风  国举义来信提出批评

　　郑州铁路医院院长有严重官僚主义作风
    国举义来信提出批评
　　编辑同志：
    最近这里发生了一件铁路医院拒绝医疗重伤战士的事件。事实经过如下：
    我们是铁道兵团某师技术营担任给水的一个连队。最近我们在郑州铁路局辖区内的郾城车站执行修水塔的任务。一个同志为急于完成工程任务负了伤，砸坏了腿。师部医院驻地在石家庄，离郾城有一千多里，因此只好把伤员抬到郾城铁路医院去急救。可是该院认为没法治疗，就介绍我们到郑州铁路医院。
    这样，我就拿着郾城铁路医院的介绍信和连部的介绍信，于八月一日护送伤员到了郑州铁路局铁路医院，先挂了号。由于伤员伤势很重，我要求值班先给他检查。他们把伤员伤处的包扎打开，看了一看，说：“骨头断了。”等了很久，医院主任才走出来。他又看了一下，说：“得住院。”伤员抬到了手术室以后院方要我先付现款。我说：“没有带现款。”他们回答：“没有不行！”我去找院长商量，院长说：“不付现款不行，这是上级的规定。再说，按规定得有团级以上机关的介绍信。”我说：“我们在郾城只是一个连队，离师部很远，先医治病人吧，等我到石家庄去拿回钱再开个上级机关的介绍信来行不行？”院长说：“介绍信倒没啥，没现钱不行。”我们要求他先给换上药。但院长坚持说：“没有钱不能换药！”我最后说：“如果这个同志死了怎么办？”院长说：“死了我们不负责任。”
    郑州铁路医院这种工作作风我认为是错误的。这不是为人民服务和对人民负责的态度。尤其在伤员伤势严重的情况下，更应该予以照顾。何况我们还有郾城医院的介绍信，而病人又是为修理水塔而负伤的。希望郑州铁路医院赶快改正这种不良作风，改进医务工作。
                  国举义
    编者按：国举义同志的来信，反映了郑州铁路医院院长在处理此一问题上的严重官僚主义作风及其营利观点。这种态度是令人难以容忍的。医院应该有病人入院的手续与规定，但不应以此为借口，而拒绝病情严重并有实际困难的伤员入院医治。希望郑州铁路局领导上检查该院的工作，纠正该院的错误。
