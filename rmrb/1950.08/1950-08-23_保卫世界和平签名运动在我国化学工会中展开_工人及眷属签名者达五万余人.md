　　The various grassroots organizations of China's Chemical Industry Union have utilized blackboards, slogans, cartoons, and radio broadcasts to conduct extensive publicity during the peace signature campaign. The Huludao Sulfuric Acid Plant convened symposiums, and chemical industry unions in Shanghai, Shenyang, and other places held cadre meetings to actively promote the work from all aspects. As of now, 45,804 chemical workers and 4,598 family members nationwide have signed. In addition, they have initiated 3,316 signatures from outside sources. Chemical workers in some areas have written letters to Korean worker brothers, expressing their deep condolences.
