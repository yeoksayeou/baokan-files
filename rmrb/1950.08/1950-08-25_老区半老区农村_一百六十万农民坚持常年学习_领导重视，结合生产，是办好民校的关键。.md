Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: In the old and semi-old liberated areas, under the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party, since the beginning of spring this year, the winter schools with better results from last year have been gradually transformed into year-round people's schools with a focus, and teaching work has been insisted upon, achieving certain results. According to statistics from North China (including Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, Beijing suburbs), East China (including Shandong, Southern Jiangsu), and Northeast China (including Jilin, Songjiang, Liaodong, Heilongjiang, Anshan suburbs, Benxi, and the Lüda area) in June: currently, there are 47,449 people's schools persisting in learning, 47,807 learning groups, and 1,676,003 people participating in learning (figures missing for Shanxi and Heilongjiang provinces). This is approximately 35 percent of the number of students enrolled in winter schools in North China, Northeast China, and East China last year. Among them, young farmers account for over 70 percent. Rural Communist Youth League members in various regions actively participate in the work of people's schools, playing a leading role in learning and becoming the backbone of persistent learning.

According to the experiences of various regions over the past three months, running people's schools well requires the attention of local leading organs and the assistance of various mass organizations, intellectuals in the villages, and other aspects, and there must be a unified leadership organization. Only in this way can the work of people's schools be carried out smoothly and according to plan. Secondly, the learning content, learning time, and organizational forms of people's schools must be closely integrated with the actualities of production. In terms of learning content, it is necessary to meet the needs of production and current production tasks. For example, in a literacy class in Heilongjiang Province, farmers learn new characters related to their lives and production, which can be used to keep work records, write IOUs, and recognize banknotes. Therefore, their enthusiasm for learning is very high, enabling them to persist in learning. The Hejiazhuang People's School in Xinle, Hebei, based on the seasonality of production, taught common knowledge such as seed soaking, pest control, green manure pressing, and tree planting. The peasant masses immediately applied this to actual production, achieving good results, and the number of people participating in learning gradually increased. Some people's schools in Hebei Province, when the government called for well digging, explained the government's policies for production and prosperity, addressing farmers' concerns about "standing out" and "increasing the burden," and explaining the correct meaning of digging wells to increase production, which was very popular among farmers. On the other hand, in Heilongjiang Province, a literacy class simply taught students to recognize characters, but the students could not apply the characters they learned and they were not related to production, so their enthusiasm for learning gradually declined. In terms of learning time, attention should be paid to not missing agricultural time. For example, most people's schools in Shexian, Hebei, use the evenings or lunch breaks for learning. During busy farming seasons (such as wheat harvesting), the people's schools are closed, and homework is assigned for the vacation period, so that students can find time to study at home. After the vacation, a test is held immediately. Thirdly, in terms of organizational forms, various forms should be adopted. For example, combining production teams and learning groups, or forming groups by region, and adopting the "little teacher" system, are all methods that are more adapted to the needs of production. However, some methods, such as "the ground is the blackboard and the hand is the pen," and "the production team is the learning group," can no longer meet the requirements of the peasant masses in the old liberated areas. Their lives are relatively stable, they have fixed learning time, they can be divided into classes for learning according to different levels of education, they can attend regular centralized classes, and they can use group decentralized mutual assistance learning. For example, the Taocheng Village People's School in Shexian, Hebei, is divided into four classes according to the level of education, sets out a certain curriculum, each class is led by a "little teacher," and a large class is held once every seven days to explain current affairs and policies, and regular tests and summaries are conducted. Although the system is not yet complete, it has become a preliminary form of a more formal rural spare-time cultural supplementary school.

　　老区半老区农村
    一百六十万农民坚持常年学习
    领导重视，结合生产，是办好民校的关键。
    【新华社二十三日讯】老解放区和半老解放区农村的文化学习，在人民政府和共产党的领导下，在今年入春以后有重点地将去年成绩较好的冬学逐步转为常年民校，并坚持教学工作，已经获得了一定成绩。据华北（包括河北、山西、平原、察哈尔、北京市郊区）、华东（包括山东、苏南）、东北（包括吉林、松江、辽东、黑龙江、鞍山郊区、本溪及旅大区）等地区六月份的统计：目前坚持学习的民校共有四万七千四百四十九处，学习小组四万七千八百零七个，参加学习的人数有一百六十七万六千零三人（人数缺山西、黑龙江两省数字）。约为去年华北、东北、华东等地区冬学入学人数的百分之三十五。其中青年农民占百分之七十以上。各地农村青年团员，积极参加民校工作，在民校学习中起了带头作用，成为坚持学习中的骨干。
    根据各地三个月来的经验，办好民校必须要有当地领导机关的重视和各群众团体、在乡知识分子等各方面的协助，并且要有统一的领导机构。只有这样民校工作才能有计划地顺利地开展。其次，民校的学习内容、学习时间、组织形式要和生产实际密切结合。在学习内容方面，要切合生产需要和当前的生产任务。如黑龙江省有一个识字班，农民学习与生活和生产有关的生字，就能用以记工账、开借条、认票子。因此，他们的学习情绪都很高，使学习能坚持下去。河北新乐何家庄民校根据生产的季节性讲了浸种、除虫、压绿肥、植树等常识，农民群众即应用到生产实际上去，收到了很好的成效，参加学习的人数也逐渐增加。河北省有的民校在政府号召打井时，针对农民怕“冒尖”、怕“增加负担”等思想顾虑，讲解政府生产发家的政策，说明打井是为了增加产量的正确意义，很受到农民的欢迎。又如黑龙江省有一个识字班，单纯教学员识字，结果学员识了字不能应用，与生产也无关系，他们的学习情绪就慢慢低落下去。在学习时间方面要注意不误农时。如河北涉县大部民校利用晚上或午晌休息时间学习。在农忙时（如麦收），民校就放假，同时规定放假期间在家的作业，使学员可以在家里抽空学习。假满上学后即举行测验。第三，在组织形式方面，要采用多种多样的形式。如将生产组和学习组结合起来，或按地区结成小组，采用小先生制，都是比较适应生产需要的方式。但有些“地当黑板手当笔”、“生产组就是学习组”的方式，在老解放区已不能满足农民群众的要求。他们生活比较安定，有了固定的学习时间，可以按照不同的文化程度分班学习，定期集中上课，并利用小组分散互助学习。如河北涉县桃城村民校按文化程度分为四班，定出一定的课程，每班由小先生领导学习，每七天上大课一次，讲解时事政策，并定期测验、总结，虽然制度还不完备，但已成为较正规的农村业余文化补习学校的雏型。
