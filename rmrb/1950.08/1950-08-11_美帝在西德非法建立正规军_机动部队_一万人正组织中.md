Xinhua News Agency, 10th. US imperialism, which has long been plotting to illegally establish a German regular army in West Germany, has now begun organizing under the name of the so-called "Federal Border Guard." According to Agence France-Presse, Bonn: the so-called "Allied High Commission" approved the West German puppet government on July 28 to establish a "mobile force" of 10,000 men. In order to conceal its illegal nature, the above-mentioned troops will nominally be directly managed by the state governments for the time being. The Bonn puppet government can mobilize this force in so-called "emergency" periods.

The establishment of this 10,000-man "mobile force" is only the beginning of the large-scale establishment of a regular army in West Germany by American war-mongers. TASS, on the 3rd, relayed a report from the Berlin Daily exposing the further ambitious plans of the Western occupation authorities, stating that recently, representatives of the American and British occupation authorities and 20 German officers held a secret meeting in Stuttgart. The meeting discussed the suggestions brought by the American representative from Washington, requiring West Germany to establish a "guard" including 40,000 infantry, 20,000 armored forces, and more than 15,000 air force personnel. The equipment of the guard will be supplied by the American occupation authorities, and American and British officers will be jointly responsible for training with West German officers. The occupation authorities have designated the area between Augsburg and Munich as the training ground for the American occupation zone, and the Lursburg wasteland as the training ground for the British occupation zone.

　　美帝在西德非法建立正规军  “机动部队”一万人正组织中
    【新华社十日讯】美帝国主义蓄谋已久在西德非法成立的德国正规军，现已在所谓“联邦警卫队”的名义下开始组织中。据法新社波恩消息称：所谓“盟国高级专署”已于七月二十八日批准西德傀儡政府成立一万人的“机动部队”。为了掩饰其非法性质，上述部队在名义上将暂时直属各州政府管理。波恩傀儡政府可以在所谓“紧急”时期，动员此项兵力。
    这一万人“机动部队”的建立，只是美国战争贩子在西德大规模建立正规军队的开始。塔斯社三日转柏林日报的消息揭露西方占领当局进一步的野心计划称：最近，美英两国占领当局代表与二十名德国军官，曾在斯图加特举行秘密会议。会上讨论了美国代表从华盛顿带来的建议，要求西德成立一支包括四万名步兵，二万名装甲部队，和一万五千多名空军的“警卫队”。警卫队的装备将由美国占领当局供应，并由美、英军官与西德军官共同负责训练。占领当局已指定奥格斯堡和慕尼黑中间的地带为美占区练兵场，卢思堡荒地为英占区练兵场。
