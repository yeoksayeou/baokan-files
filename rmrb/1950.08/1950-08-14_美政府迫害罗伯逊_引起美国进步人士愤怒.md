　　U.S. Government Persecution of Robeson
    Arouses Anger Among American Progressives
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 13th] TASS Moscow dispatch, correspondent Lasardin of the newspaper "Pravda" writes: The barbaric, fascist and harsh policies used by the American authorities to suppress progressive organizations and leaders have become commonplace in the United States. J. Edgar Hoover, head of the U.S. secret police, openly boasted that the FBI is constantly vigilant in monitoring 500,000 "suspected" Americans.
    The American reactionaries are particularly keen on persecuting the famous artist and member of the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress, Paul Robeson. Robeson's songs—songs of anger and struggle, calling for brave defense of peace and struggle against warmongers—have infuriated the American constabulary, who have tried every possible means to silence Robeson. Recently, the U.S. government banned Robeson from leaving the country. This shameful decision was no accident. Because Robeson bravely exposed the American imperialist aggression against the Korean people. Linked to Robeson's name is the struggle of black people for their freedom. State Department officials admitted frankly that severe measures have been taken against Robeson because of his tireless struggle for peace.
    The persecution of Robeson has aroused anger among progressive people in the United States. Robeson's millions of friends around the world will support the angry protests against the arrogant police tyranny of the American authorities.

　　美政府迫害罗伯逊
    引起美国进步人士愤怒
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：真理报驻纽约记者拉萨丁写道：美国当局用来压制进步组织及领袖的野蛮法西斯苛政，在美国已是司空见惯的了。美国秘密警察头子胡佛曾公开吹嘘说，联邦调查局正经常警惕地监视着五十万“有嫌疑的”美国人。
    美国反动派表现特别热心于迫害著名艺术家及世界保卫和平大会常设委员会委员罗伯逊。罗伯逊的歌曲——愤怒与斗争的歌曲，号召勇敢地保卫和平及为反对战争贩子而斗争。这触怒了美国宪兵，他们企图用各种可能的方法使罗伯逊闭口。最近，美国政府禁止罗伯逊出国。这个可耻的决定不是偶然的。因为罗伯逊勇敢地揭穿了美国帝国主义对朝鲜人民的侵略。与罗伯逊的名字联系着的，是黑人争取他们的自由的斗争。国务院官员坦白承认，由于罗伯逊不倦地为争取和平而斗争，已采取严峻措施来对付他。
    对罗伯逊的迫害在美国进步人士中间引起了愤怒。罗伯逊在全世界的数百万友人，将支持反对美国当局狂妄警察苛政的愤怒抗议。
