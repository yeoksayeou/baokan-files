　　Cotton Production Area of Ningbo Prefecture, Zhejiang
    600,000 Mu of Cotton Fields Growing Well
    Insect Pests Occurring in Some Areas, Vigorously Being Eradicated
    [Our Newspaper, Ningbo] Nearly 600,000 mu of cotton fields in the cotton-producing areas of Yuyao, Cixi, and northern Zhenhai in Ningbo Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, are developing well under the active support of the People's Government and the careful cultivation of cotton farmers. The leaves are lush and the branches are thick. They are now flowering and producing bolls, and a good harvest is expected.
    In cotton planting, the People's Government has given cotton farmers full support. The Cotton and Hemp Guidance Center loaned 890,000 jin of high-quality Dezi cotton seeds in a timely manner, promoted improved varieties, and enhanced the production enthusiasm of cotton farmers. The People's Bank loaned 1,013,614.65 jin of ammonium sulfate fertilizer, 519,141.8 jin of superphosphate, 7,931.25 jin of bean cake, and 29,806.5 jin of rapeseed cake, solving the fertilizer difficulties for 117,437.7 mu of cotton fields. In particular, the seawall project along the coast of Zhenhai, Cixi, and Yuyao counties, stretching over 300 li and involving 1.2 million cubic meters of earthwork, had been repeatedly damaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries and suffered disasters year after year. This year, the People's Government used work relief to lead the construction and repair efforts, effectively protecting the cotton from being eroded by seawater or reducing the impact; at the same time, the People's Government also led farmers in pest control, intensive cultivation, and drainage work. All of this encouraged farmers in the cotton-producing areas to cultivate their cotton fields. Currently, most cotton fields have completed five to six rounds of inter-tillage and weeding, with loose soil and clear of weeds. In addition, the climate this year has been good, with timely rainfall, which is suitable for cotton seedlings to grow and develop. The cotton plants are already one and a half to two chi tall, with flowers and bolls covering the branches, and growth is vigorous.
    However, red spiders, leaf rollers and other insect pests have been found in some areas. In Sihai Township, Simen District, Yuyao, 5% of the cotton seedlings have been found to be withered due to the erosion of leaf rollers. In order to ensure this year's cotton production increase, the Ningbo Prefectural Commissioner's Office issued an emergency notice on the 4th of this month, requiring all counties to quickly mobilize the masses to eliminate pests and prevent them from spreading and causing a reduction in cotton production. Currently, farmers in all cotton-producing areas have been urgently mobilized to go to the fields for pest control. For example, in Zhouzhao Town, the main cotton-producing area of Yuyao, five villages killed 140,000 leaf rollers in three days, achieving great results.

　　浙江宁波专区产棉区
    六十万亩棉田生长良好
    部分地区发生虫害正大力扑杀
    【本报宁波讯】浙江省宁波专区的余姚、慈溪、镇海北部产棉区近六十万亩棉田，在人民政府积极扶植与棉农加工耕作下，得到良好的发育，叶茂枝粗，现已开花结桃，收成可望。
    在植棉中，人民政府给予棉农以充分的扶植。棉麻指导所适时贷放了优良品种德字棉籽八十九万斤，推广了良种，提高棉农的生产情绪；人民银行贷放肥料硫酸铔一百零一万三千六百十四点六五斤，过磷酸钾五十一万九千一百四十一点八斤，豆饼七千九百三十一点二五斤，菜籽饼二万九千八百零六点五斤，解决了十一万七千四百三十七点七亩棉田的肥料困难。特别是镇、慈、余三县沿海长达三百余里、一百二十余万土方的海塘工程，因遭受国民党反动派连年破坏，屡次成灾。今年人民政府以工代赈，领导兴修，有力的保护了今年棉花不受或少受海水的侵蚀；同时，人民政府又领导农民进行除虫、精耕细作、排水等工作，这一切都鼓舞了棉区农民对棉田的加工。现大部棉田已完成五次至六次的中耕除草，土松草光；加以今年气候良好，雨水适时，适合棉苗滋长发育，棉棵已有一尺半到二尺多高，花桃满枝，生长旺盛。
    惟目前部分地区发现了红蜘蛛、卷叶虫等虫害，余姚泗门区四海乡发现有百分之五的棉苗因卷叶虫的侵蚀而枯死。为了保证今年的棉花增产，宁波专署已于本月四日发出紧急通报，要求各县赶紧动员群众扑杀害虫，免使蔓延，酿成棉花减产。现各棉产区农民均已紧急动员，下地除治。如余姚主要棉产区周朝镇五个村，在三天内即扑杀卷叶虫十四万条，取得很大成绩。
