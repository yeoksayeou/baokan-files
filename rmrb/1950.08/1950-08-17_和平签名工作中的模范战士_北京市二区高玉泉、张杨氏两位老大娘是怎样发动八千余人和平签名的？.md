Model Fighters in the Peace Signature Campaign
    —How Did the Two Elderly Women, Gao Yuquan and Zhang Yangshi, in Beijing's Second District, Launch a Peace Signature Campaign with Over 8,000 People?
    By Our Reporter Ai Tiemin
    The wave of defending world peace and opposing imperialist aggression has swept through every corner of the world. In our country, nearly 60 million people have signed the Stockholm Appeal, demonstrating the great determination of the Chinese people to oppose aggression. And our larger-scale peace signature campaign to enlist 200 million signatures is surging forward. In the past signature campaigns, many brave and selfless peace fighters have emerged who resolutely fight for the cause of peace. The two elderly women, Gao Yuquan and Zhang Yangshi, in Beijing are such brave model figures.
    Gao Yuquan lives on Erlong Street in Beijing's Second District. She is 51 years old this year. She is illiterate, but after learning about the significance of the movement against American imperialist aggression in Taiwan and Korea and for the defense of world peace from meetings of the Eighth Branch of the Beijing Second District Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and from her two daughters who are elementary school teachers, she and another 55-year-old elderly woman, Zhang Yangshi, who is a military dependent, enthusiastically responded to the peace signature campaign. Although they are both over 50 years old, they know that the work of defending peace is not limited by age, and they decided to contribute their strength to the cause of defending peace. They decided to work hard to carry out the peace signature campaign.
    Of the two elderly women, only Zhang Yangshi knew a few characters, so they decided to cooperate. Gao Yuquan's daughter painted a dove on a white cloth and wrote the slogan "Oppose the American Imperialist Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea." Each of them hung one around their neck. This simple and clear sign provided a powerful explanation for their actions. On July 22, they first went to the Second District Office to collect the signatures of all their working comrades. Then, they set off for the Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace with dry food. They wore doves and slogans around their necks and carried pens, ink, signature books, and wooden boards for signing. Whenever they met someone, they immediately enthusiastically asked him or her to sign. Workers, soldiers, and students enthusiastically signed their names in their signature books. When they were hungry, they ate some of the dry food they had brought with them. They did not stop working until dark. That day, from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., they collected the signatures of more than 1,800 people. When they dragged their tired bodies back home to rest, the results of their work ignited the hearts of the two elderly people.
    The next day, they started collecting signatures at 8 o'clock, enthusiastically inviting everyone who passed by and visited in front of the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City to sign. In less than three hours, they had collected more than 600 signatures. "Signing a name is equal to a bullet, and we use it to defeat American imperialist aggression." The two elderly women kept this truth in mind at all times. They did not rest even when they were tired. At noon, there were fewer people in the Forbidden City area, so they walked to the Labor People's Cultural Palace. At the Cultural Palace, they met two female students who saw the two elderly women wearing peace doves and holding signature books, sweating profusely from exhaustion. They said to the elderly women, "Grandma, the weather is so hot, you must be very tired. Let us help you for a while, okay?" The two elderly women thought that collecting peace signatures was a great work and that they should not be lazy because they were tired, so they declined repeatedly. However, the sincerity of these two female students made it impossible for them to completely refuse, so the four of them cooperated and quickly collected the signatures of more than 200 people. The two elderly women walked into the amusement room of the Cultural Palace and asked every worker comrade who was entertaining themselves to sign. People drinking tea and resting in the Cultural Palace tea house saw the working spirit of the elderly women, who were both tired and hot, and insisted on asking them to drink some tea and take a rest. But the two elderly women said, "In order to defend peace, we are not afraid of being tired, we will not rest." For the sake of peace, they forgot their hunger, thirst, and fatigue. This whole day, they collected the signatures of more than 1,900 people.
    Young students enthusiastically and enthusiastically wrote their names on the signature books of the elderly women, and also wanted to help them carry out the collection work. On the third day, the two elderly women went to Hongda Middle School and Xinsheng Middle School separately, where they collected the signatures of more than 800 people.
    The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army understood the meaning of defending peace the most. When the two elderly women walked to the Cultural Palace again on July 27, braving the hot sun, they were immediately surrounded by a group of soldiers after entering the gate. While signing, the soldiers said, "It is our responsibility to oppose American aggression and defend world peace. Of course, we must sign." In front of the hall, they met a young woman with three children. When she saw the peace doves and slogans on their bodies, she sincerely asked for permission to sign the signature book. She said very excitedly, "I am Korean. I am very grateful that you are carrying out peace signatures to help our country and oppose American aggression. Unfortunately, I have too many things to do at home and cannot spare the time to do this great work with you. I don't know what our Korean home has been bombed into by the American beasts' planes; I am very happy that our People's Army is winning every day and will one day drive the American devils into the sea!" While she spoke, she wrote the names of her family of seven on the signature book. This international friend's hatred of the American war of aggression and love of world peace further motivated these two elderly women. They felt even more the preciousness of peace and the importance of collecting peace signatures. On this day, in the Cultural Palace, everyone who saw these two gray-haired, hard-working peace fighters enthusiastically signed their names. After more than ten hours of struggle, they collected the signatures of more than 1,700 people. Looking at each different handwriting on the signature book, they forgot the heat, thirst, and fatigue they had experienced all day, and felt warmth and strength.
    After four consecutive days of work, they were really tired. They had to talk, run, and keep talking and running for more than twelve hours a day. And they also had some housework to take care of. But they never delayed the signature work. On July 28, the elderly woman Gao Yuquan went to the Women's Affiliated High School of Normal University by herself and collected more than 200 signatures.
    By the 29th, they had counted the signature books and had collected about 7,000 signatures in the past five days. The tireless work of the two elderly women in the past five days had achieved great results. The peace signatures of 7,000 people are indeed a considerable number. The responsible comrades of the Eighth Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association encouraged them, and people they knew praised them, but they did not feel the slightest pride. On the contrary, they were still not satisfied with their achievements.
    At 8:00 a.m. on the 30th, the two of them rushed to the Summer Palace to sign. In the park, they happily welcomed the signature of every tourist. At the end of the Long Corridor, they met more than 100 worker comrades who signed their names very excitedly, and some asked: "Where did the old ladies come from? How old are you? It's really hard work in such hot weather." The cordial greetings of the workers strengthened the determination of the two elderly women. Next to the Stone Boat, they were welcomed into the house by more than 30 people managing the ferry boats and asked them to rest. They collected dozens of signatures for the two elderly women. Finally, they also responsibly sent the two elderly women to the Dragon King Temple by boat. On the boat, they met a visiting group from the south, and the elderly women asked more than 30 of them to sign. The people from the visiting group also drew a boat on their signature book as a souvenir. About 400 people swimming in Kunming Lake and resting on the shore of the Dragon King Temple were mobilized to sign by the two elderly women, and seven Soviet friends also ran ashore from the lake in their swimming suits and signed their names in their signature books.
    For the sake of signing, they did not miss any opportunity. At 3:00 p.m., they returned to the city from the Summer Palace. In the car, they mobilized the people in the same car to sign. When they arrived at the Western Suburbs Park, they were already very tired. But they thought that there would be many peace-loving people in the park who had not signed, and they thought that they should not let them miss the opportunity to sign. They got off the car, and the comrades guarding the gate who supported the cause of peace allowed them to enter the park for free. In an hour, they ran many places and collected the signatures of more than 100 people. After this day's toil and dozens of miles of running, they collected more than 1,000 peace signatures.
    August 1st was the Army Day of our People's Liberation Army. According to their original plan, it was the most intense and also the last day of their peace signature collection work. Gao Yuquan took the signature book and mobilized everyone passing by on West Chang'an Street to participate in the signature. When people asked her, "What is the signature for?" she would answer with the sentence that impressed her the most: "Signing a name is equal to a bullet, and we use it to defeat American imperialist aggression!" On this day, she alone mobilized more than 800 peace-loving sons and daughters of China to write their names on the signature book.
    Finally, after counting the work of seven days, the two elderly women collected the peace signatures of 8,234 people!
    This is a huge achievement! It is a model worthy of learning by every peace fighter in China!

　　和平签名工作中的模范战士
    —北京市二区高玉泉、张杨氏两位老大娘是怎样发动八千余人和平签名的？
    本报记者  艾铁民
    保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的浪潮在全世界每个角落掀起来了，在我们的国家里，已有近六千万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，表现我们中国人民反对侵略的伟大决心。而我们争取二万万人签名的更大规模的和平签名运动正在高涨着。在过去签名运动中已出现不少的勇敢的、忘我的为和平事业而坚决奋斗的和平战士。北京市的高玉泉和张杨氏两位老大娘就是这样勇敢的模范人物。
    高玉泉住在北京二区二龙街，今年五十一岁了，她还不识字，但她从北京市第二区中苏友好协会总支会第八支会的集会中，以及两个作小学教员的女儿口中，了解了反对美帝侵略台湾朝鲜及保卫世界和平运动的意义后，她和另一五十五岁的军属老大娘张杨氏，便热烈响应和平签名运动。她们虽然都是五十岁以上的人了，但是她们知道保卫和平的工作是不分老少的，她们决定为保卫和平事业贡献自己的力量，她们决定努力进行和平签名的工作。
    两位老大娘中，只有张杨氏认识几个字，于是她们决定二人合作，由高玉泉的女儿用白布画上一个鸽子，又写上“反对美帝国主义侵略台湾朝鲜运动”的标语，她俩每人在胸前挂上一份。在这一份简单显明的标帜替她们的行动作了有力地说明。七月二十二日她们首先到第二区公所去征集了全体工作同志的签名，然后她们带着干粮出发到北京市劳动人民文化宫。她们胸前挂着鸽子和标语，手里拿着笔墨、签名册和签名用的木板。每逢遇到一个人，她们立即热烈地请他或她签名。工人、战士、学生都热烈地在她们的签名册上签上自己的名字。她们饿了，就吃点带去的干粮。一直到天黑，她们才停止工作。那天从早七时一直到晚八时，共征集了一千八百余人的签名。当她们拖着疲倦的身体回到家中休息的时候，工作成绩燃烧着两位老年人的心。
    第二天，她们从八点钟开始征集，在故宫午门前热诚地邀请每个过路的和游玩的人签名。不到三小时她们已征集了六百余个签名。“签一个名，等于一个子弹，我们用它来打垮美帝国主义的侵略。”两位老大娘心里时刻记着这个真理，她们累了，也不休息。中午时，故宫一带人少了，他们走到劳动人民文化宫。在文化宫遇到二个女学生，她们看见二位老大娘自佩和平鸽子，手持签名册，累得满头大汗，就向老大娘说：“老大娘天气这样热，你们已经很累了，让我们替你们一会好吗？”两位老大娘想到征集和平签名工作是伟大的工作，不能因为疲累就偷懒不作，因而再三推辞。但是这二位女学生的诚意的帮助，使她不能完全拒绝，于是她们四人合作，很快的征集了二百余人签名。二位老大娘走进文化宫游艺室里，请每个正在娱乐的工人同志签了名。文化宫茶座上喝茶休息的人们看到老大娘这种工作精神，又累又热，坚决地请她们喝点茶，歇一歇。但两位老大娘说：“为了保卫和平，我们不怕累，我们不歇。”为了和平，她们忘了自己的饥渴与劳累。这一整天，她们征集到一千九百余人的签名。
    青年学生们，热情地踊跃地在老大娘的签名簿上写上自己的名字，并且还要帮助她们进行征集工作，第三天二位老大娘分头到宏达中学和新生中学，在那里她们又征集到八百余人的签名。
    人民解放军的战士们是最了解保卫和平的意义的。两位老大娘在七月二十七日，冒着炎热的太阳又走到文化宫时，进门后立刻被一群战士包围了。战士们一边签名一边说：“反对美国侵略，保卫世界和平，是我们的责任，我们当然要签名。”在大厅前面，她们遇到一个带着三个孩子的青年妇女，她看见了她们身上的和平鸽子和标语，诚恳地请求允许她在签名簿上签名，她并且很激动地说：“我是朝鲜人，你们为了帮助我们的国家，反对美国侵略，进行和平签名，我非常感激。可惜，我家里事多分不开身和你们一道做这伟大的工作。我不知道我们的朝鲜家里被美国野兽的飞机炸成什么样子；我很高兴我们的人民军每天都获得胜利，终有一天要把美国鬼子赶进海里的！”她一边说，一边将她一家七口人的名字都写在签名簿上。这位国际友人对美国侵略战争的憎恶、对世界和平的热爱，更激励了这两位老大娘。她们更感到和平的可贵，更感到征集和平签名工作的重要。这一天，在文化宫里，凡是看到这两位头发斑白的辛勤工作的和平战士的人们，都踊跃地签上自己的名字，十余小时的奋斗，共征集了一千七百余人的签名。看着签名册上的每一个不同字迹，她们忘记了一整天所经历的炎热、饥渴与疲劳，而感到温暖与力量。
    接连四天的工作，她们实实在在是疲劳了，要说话，要跑路，而且是一天十二个小时以上的时间内不断地说话和跑路。并且也还有些家务事要料理。但她们决不耽误签名工作。七月二十八日，高玉泉老大娘自己又跑到师大女附中里征集了二百余个签名。
    到二十九日为止，她们统计了一下签名册，五日来已征集到七千名左右了。两位老大娘五日来的不辞劳苦的工作获得伟大的成果。七千人的和平签名确是个可观的数字。中苏友协第八支会的负责同志鼓励她们，相识的人赞扬她们，但她们并不感到丝毫的骄傲，相反地，她们还不满意她们的成绩。
    三十日上午八时，她们两位赶到了颐和园去签名。在园里，她们愉快地迎接着每个游人的签名。在长廊的尽头，她们碰见一百多个工人同志，他们很兴奋地签了每个人的名字，有的并问：“老大娘是从那里来的？多大年纪了？这样热天真辛苦了。”工人们亲切的慰问，更加坚强了这两位老大娘的决心。在石舫旁边，她们被三十余个管理渡船的人迎接到屋里，让她们休息。他们替这两位老大娘征集了几十个签名，最后他们还负责地把这两位老大娘用船送到龙王庙。在船上她们遇到来自南方的一个参观团，老大娘们请她们三十余人都签了名。参观团的人还在她们的签名本子上画了一个船，留作纪念。昆明湖里游泳的人，龙王庙岸上歇夏的人，约四百余人都被这两位老大娘发动签了名，还有七个苏联友人也穿着游泳衣从湖里跑上岸，在她们的签名册上签了名。
    为了签名，她们不放过任何一个机会。下午三时，她们从颐和园回城，在汽车里，她们发动同车的人们都签了名。到了西郊公园，那时她们已经很疲乏了。但是她们想到公园内会有许多没有签过名的爱好和平的人们，她们认为不应使他们错过签名的机会。她们下了车，赞助和平事业的守门的同志，让她们免费入园。在一小时内，她们跑了很多地方，征集了一百余人的签名。这一天的劳顿、数十里地的奔波，她们共征集了一千以上的和平签名。
    八月一日，是我们人民解放军的建军节，按照她们的原定计划，是她们征集和平签名工作最紧张、也是最后的一天。高玉泉拿着签名册，在西长安街一带发动每一个过路的人参加签名，当人们问她：“签名做什么？”她就用给她印象最深的一句话来回答：“签一个名，就等于一个子弹，我们用它来打垮美帝国主义的侵略！”这一天，她一个人又发动了八百多位爱好和平的中华儿女在签名册上写了自己的名字。
    最后统计一下七天的工作，她们两位老大娘共征集了八千二百三十四个人的和平签名！
    这是巨大的成绩！是值得全中国每一个和平战士学习的模范！
