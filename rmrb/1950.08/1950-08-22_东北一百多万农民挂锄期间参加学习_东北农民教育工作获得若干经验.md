　　More Than One Million Farmers in Northeast China Participate in Learning During the Off-Season
    Northeast China's Farmer Education Work Gains Several Experiences
    [Our Newspaper News] Special correspondent Xu Xing reports: A widespread learning movement has unfolded among farmers in various parts of Northeast China during the off-season. After the winter literacy campaign concluded this spring, many winter schools transitioned into regular learning organizations. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 1,575,000 farmer students in the entire region (excluding Rehe Province and the cities of Shenyang and Fushun) are participating in regular people's schools and study groups, equivalent to 37% of the number of people in the winter literacy campaign. The vast majority of these learning organizations persisted in their studies during the early spring plowing preparation and spring plowing stages, achieving considerable results. For example, farmers in Chaoyang Village, Hulan County, Songjiang Province, who participated in learning, recognized about 150 characters during this stage. Some of them, together with the characters they learned in winter school, can now keep work records and write simple letters. However, after entering the summer hoeing season, the farmers became particularly busy. Except for a few learning organizations with active members as the backbone and strong leadership, most farmer learning organizations came to a standstill.

    In July, the Education Department of the Northeast People's Government and the education departments of various provinces and counties successively issued notices on launching farmer learning during the off-season. The notices requested that various localities utilize this relatively idle period of agricultural production (about one or two months) to first restore and consolidate existing regular learning organizations, and make appropriate developments based on specific conditions; in places where regular learning has not yet transitioned, farmers should also be organized to learn during this period, check the "return to ignorance" (whether they have forgotten) of literacy from winter school, review the characters learned in winter school, and consolidate the achievements of winter school, so that students will not have to start from scratch when this year's winter school is opened. Various localities have made specific arrangements one after another, and learning has now begun universally. For example, Songjiang Province plans to strive for 420,000 people to participate in learning during the off-season. In Zhengyi Village, Wukeshu District, Yushu County, Jilin Province, more than 400 people have already participated in learning, basically reaching the total number of people who entered winter school last year.

    Based on the experience of organizing farmers to conduct regular learning in various localities this year, there are several points worth noting. First, before the start of each new season, the leadership in various localities should formulate overall plans and requirements based on specific conditions, quickly arrange learning, and conduct inspections and summaries of the learning in the previous stage, mobilize each student to summarize their own learning achievements, and at the same time reward model students, teachers, and little teachers at mass meetings to encourage teaching enthusiasm and mobilize more people to enroll. Many places have paid attention to this point, which has greatly helped to consolidate learning. Conversely, in many places, because the arrangements were not timely or there was no clear plan and requirements, farmers' learning could not be carried out, or if the masses spontaneously started learning, it also collapsed due to a lack of planned leadership. Second, during the busy farming season, emphasis should be placed on reviewing the characters learned in the previous stage. If we simply pay attention to learning new ones, we often forget the old ones because farmers have less time to learn, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. For example, Liang Yongchang of Xiaofenling Village, Acheng, learned 30 new characters during the summer hoeing season, but forgot 102 of the 500 characters he learned in winter school and during spring plowing. Third, teachers in various localities have a bias in teaching methods towards single characters that are not related to reality. Farmers learn them but cannot use them, making them difficult to remember and easy to forget. This bias should be corrected, and teaching should be based on textbooks as much as possible, emphasizing that learning characters should achieve "four abilities" (being able to recognize, write, speak, and use). In addition to literacy education, it is very popular to appropriately increase some political, hygiene, common sense of production, and arithmetic according to the needs of farmers. For example, after the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, some farmers in Acheng had concerns, fearing that there would be another land reform in Northeast China; some farmers in Hulan were still unclear about the Marriage Law, rumored to be a "divorce law"; Xiaofenling Village in Acheng had many women's diseases, and children had smallpox last year, so everyone urgently requested to learn about maternal and child hygiene; many people in the local area suffered from "big bone joint disease" (a local disease), and farmers kept asking how to avoid getting this disease; Li Wanjun of Chaoyang Village, Hulan, disinfected wheat seeds and did not have smut disease, so the masses requested to study this production experience; many farmers are very happy to learn how to keep work records and accounts. If we combine literacy education to meet these needs of farmers, we can improve everyone's learning enthusiasm.

### 东北一百多万农民挂锄期间参加学习  东北农民教育工作获得若干经验

　　东北一百多万农民挂锄期间参加学习
    东北农民教育工作获得若干经验
    【本报讯】特约通讯员许行报道：东北各地农民广泛展开挂锄期间的学习运动。该区在今春结束冬学运动后，许多冬学转入了经常性的学习组织。据不完全统计，全区（缺热河省和沈阳、抚顺两市材料）参加经常民校和学习小组的农民学员共一百五十七万五千余人，相当于冬学人数的百分之三十七。这些学习组织在春初备耕和春耕阶段，绝大部分都坚持了学习，取得了相当的成绩。如松江省呼兰县朝阳村参加学习的农民，在这一阶段中都认识了一百五十个字左右。其中一部分人连同在冬学中所识的字，已能记工账和写简单信件了。但进入夏锄季节后，农民特别忙，除了有积极分子作骨干、领导上也抓得紧的少数学习组织之外，大部分农民学习组织都陷于停顿状态。
    七月份，东北人民政府教育部和各省、县教育部门，先后发出了关于开展挂锄期间农民学习的通知。要求各地利用这一段农业生产较闲的时间（约一两个月），首先恢复、整顿已有的经常学习组织，并可根据具体情况作适当的发展；在未转入经常学习的地方，也应在此时期组织农民学习，检查冬学识字的“回生”（是否忘记了）情况，复习在冬学中所学过的字，巩固冬学成绩，以免到今年开办冬学时学员们又要从头学起。各地先后作了具体布置，现已普遍开始学习。如松江省计划争取四十二万人参加挂锄期间的学习。吉林省榆树县五棵树区正义村，已有四百余人参加学习，基本上达到了去年入冬学的全部人数。
    根据本年来各地组织农民进行经常学习的经验，有几点值得注意。第一，每一新的季节开始前，各地领导上应根据具体情况，订出总的计划与要求，迅速布置学习，并对前一阶段的学习进行检查和总结，发动每一个学员总结自己的学习成绩，同时在群众大会奖励模范学员、教师与小先生，以鼓励教学情绪和发动更多的群众入学。有许多地方注意了这一点，对巩固学习有很大作用。相反的，许多地方因为布置不及时或者没有明确的计划和要求，农民学习便搞不起来，或群众自发地搞起来了，也因缺乏有计划的领导而垮台。第二，在农忙季节，应着重复习前一阶段学得的字。若单纯注意学习新的，则因农民学习时间少，往往忘了旧的，得不偿失。如阿城小分岭屯梁永昌，夏锄期间学了三十个生字，却把冬学及春耕时学的五百字忘了一百零二个。第三，各地教员在教学方法上有教不相联系的单字的偏向，农民学了不会用，难记易忘。这种偏向应注意纠正，尽可能根据课本教，强调学字要达到“四会”（会认、会写、会讲、会用）。除了识字教育之外，根据农民需要适当地增加一些政治、卫生、生产常识和算术等，很受农民欢迎。如土地改革法公布后，阿城有些农民发生顾虑，怕东北还来一次土改；呼兰有些农民对婚姻法还不清楚，传说为“离婚法”；阿城小分岭屯因妇女病多，去年小孩患过天花，大家都迫切要求学习妇婴卫生常识；当地患“大骨头节病”（一种地方病）的很多，农民不断打听怎样可以不得此病；呼兰朝阳村李万钧小麦种子消了毒，没长黑穗病，群众就要求研究此种生产经验；许多农民对于学会记工算账都是很高兴的。如果联系识字教育，满足农民这些要求，可以提高大家的学习情绪。
