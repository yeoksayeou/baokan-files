Two Years of the Malayan War
By O. Orestov, translated by Tang Xianren

Two years ago, in June 1948, the British imperialists launched their colonial plundering war in Malaya. They conspired to crush the Malayan Communist Party and progressive trade unions "in one fell swoop," thereby eliminating the vanguard of democratic forces and strangling the national liberation movement.

This provocative conspiracy has met with a shameful failure. In Malaya, as in other colonies during World War II, social and political changes had taken place, but the imperialists misjudged these changes. They did not anticipate the rising political consciousness of the people and the strength of their desire to liberate themselves from imperialist oppression. Finally, they also ignored the rich experience in guerrilla warfare that the Malayan people had gained in the war against the Japanese invaders.

The bloody provocation in June 1948 did not take the Malayan people by surprise. Soldiers of the People's Anti-Japanese Army formed guerrilla units and entered into open combat with the British colonialists.

For two years, the national liberation war has spread throughout Malaya. The British Labour government has tried its best to crush and extinguish the people's movement. More than 100,000 British troops are stationed in Malaya, supplied with modern artillery, tanks, and aircraft. Lincoln heavy bombers, Vampire jets, Marauder bombers, Spitfire fighters, and jet fighters, flame throwers – these are the Labour government's answers to the Malayan people's demands for freedom. The expeditionary force is bombing and burning Malayan villages. Fierce Dyak tribesmen and Gurkhas have been specially used to help eliminate the guerrillas. Planters have been authorized to torture any "suspected" Malayan. Terror reigns throughout Malaya.

Initially, the British government tried to conceal the truth, portraying the Malayan guerrilla fighters as isolated "groups of terrorists" mainly composed of Chinese. The reactionary British newspapers described the national liberation movement as the actions of a small group of "bandits," while portraying the British plundering war as a war to "restore law and order." Later, when it could no longer conceal the truth that the Malayan people were fighting for national liberation, British ministers began to claim that this national liberation movement should be dealt with in the shortest possible time and that "order" should be restored immediately.

But two years later, the British imperialists have had to admit that they have failed.

Previously, the British government had to keep the British working class and public opinion in general ignorant of the true nature and scale of the Malayan war. However, now the ruling circles in London have had to abandon this policy. Colonial Secretary Griffiths declared before leaving Singapore on June 8: "This is a war. We will continue to fight relentlessly and mercilessly until victory is achieved."

The Conservative Party's Daily Mail admitted: "The situation today is worse than when the war began," and the newspaper suggested that "anyone seen carrying weapons" should be shot on the spot.

The Times was similarly alarmed:

"It must be admitted that the rebellion is a real war, requiring the concentration of all local resources; and steps must be taken gradually to satisfy the Malayan people's desire for a greater degree of self-government."

This talk of "self-government" is not new. It is a common conspiracy of the British imperialists, aiming to mislead the colonial people and continue to maintain British rule under a different guise. The British are preparing to offer the establishment of a "self-governing government" to Malaya, mainly to induce the Malayan people to lay down their arms and abandon their armed struggle for independence. How much the British imperialists hate even giving the Malayan people a purely verbal concession can be seen in the following article in the Daily Telegraph:

"British officials believe that full self-government may take a generation (thirty years) to achieve."

Undoubtedly, Colonial Secretary Griffiths' speech to the Malayan people in Kuala Lumpur on June 2 revealed the true intentions of the British ruling clique.

"We must win the war, otherwise, it will be difficult to have further discussions on political rights, constitution, and other aspects of democratic development."

The Labour authorities' efforts to publicize the Malayan national liberation movement as not being composed of Malayans, but of Chinese who account for 40 percent of the national population, is again very significant. This propaganda technique, among other purposes, intends to sow the seeds of national hatred in Malaya. But everyone in Malaya clearly knows that the first person executed for defending the cause of Malayan freedom was a young Malayan who had served in the Royal Air Force. Everyone also knows that the leaders of the Malayan democratic organizations have been imprisoned, and that the expeditionary force has carried out retaliatory actions against the Malayan farmers because they hid the guerrillas and provided them with food. The leaflets distributed by British aircraft over Malaya are printed in Malay, not in Chinese, and their calls to lay down arms are addressed to the Malayans.

Imperialist propaganda is powerless to shake the solidarity of the Malayan, Chinese, and Indian working people who live in Malaya and are fighting for Malayan independence. Moreover, the British troops suppressing the national liberation movement are also powerless. The defeat suffered in Malaya is causing great shock and panic within the British ruling clique. The profits of rubber and tin monopolies are in a critical state, and these profits are the main source of earning dollars, because Malaya is one of the world's suppliers of rubber and tin.

The real masters of Malaya are the British tycoons, such as Sir John Barlow, Sir A. Macfadyen, Sir E. Macfadyen, Sir John Hay, J.E. Addinsell, F.E. Maguire, and Charles Maen.

"These seven men do not hold positions in the cabinet," the London Workers' Daily wrote, "nor do they hold important government positions. But they are not without influence in state affairs, because they control 25 of the 61 major rubber companies in Malaya... and while the British and Malayan people are suffering, these rubber companies are reaping huge profits.

"Nearly three-quarters of Malaya's rubber-producing areas are occupied by Europeans, mainly British, and according to Mr. Noel Baker, these plantations are worth a total of 120 million pounds.

"The total profit of the 61 rubber companies in Malaya last year was £2,457,199... but the British people have already paid £100 million to £150 million for this war. If the war does not stop, they will have to pay a heavy price. To the British people, every life of the British and Malayan people is too expensive a price. It is time for us to stop paying."

The British planters and tin miners want to keep their assets in Malaya. The main instigators of the colonial war are the planters who drain the fat from Malaya and their backers in the London financial district. Rubber tycoon and Conservative MP Fletcher told the British government: "Just make it clear that we do not intend to withdraw from Malaya within ten years."

Over the past three months, British and Gurkha reinforcements and more aircraft have been transferred from Hong Kong to Malaya. British aircraft have flown 2,754 sorties in Malaya over the past year.

In February of this year, the British authorities launched a "Bandit Suppression Month," hoping to recruit some local capitalists to oppose the national liberation movement during the "Bandit Suppression Month." However, this sinister adventure had to fail because the people resolutely refused to participate in the expeditionary force. Malayan police chief Gray admitted that the "Bandit Suppression Month" did not bring much improvement in the anti-guerrilla war.

Now, a retired colonial plunder expert has become a prominent figure, and this person is Lieutenant General Briggs, who has been given special powers and the grand title of "Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression Operations." At the end of May, the "Briggs Plan" was put into effect. A new offensive was officially announced. British troops were deployed on a defensive line cutting off the southern part of the peninsula (within the state of Johor). The idea is to push the defense line northward and then to the whole of Malaya.

The defense line has in fact begun to move, but to no avail. An officer who participated in this offensive wrote: "In a whole week, his troops did not encounter a single guerrilla, only abandoned camps in the jungle. The People's Liberation Army used mobile tactics, retreating, but reappeared on both sides of the 'Briggs Line'." Newspaper reports show that since the new offensive began, guerrilla attacks on British troops, police stations, and plantations have increased. Recently, newspapers have stopped mentioning the Briggs offensive.

The second point of the "Briggs Plan" is to intensify terrorist measures against the residents, sentencing to death residents who shelter or supply guerrillas, and bombing and destroying villages.

Peaceful Chinese residents (overseas Chinese) are being expelled from the area. Before the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the British authorities drove them back to Kuomintang China, where they would suffer or starve. The total number of Chinese farmers who have been deported in this way reached 6,444. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the deportation order was stopped, but today Briggs is putting the Chinese people into special concentration camps.

Progressive trade unions in Malaya have been banned, and thousands upon thousands of patriots have been imprisoned. Griffiths told the House of Commons that 25,482 detention orders have been issued since July 1948, and as of May 31 of this year, 10,857 people were still in detention.

For a long time, due to the increasingly unfavorable situation of the British in Malaya, Defense Minister Strachey and Colonial Secretary Griffiths were sent to Malaya on May 31.

Escorted by armored vehicles, the two ministers made a trip to several areas and personally delivered about twelve speeches, which were full of boasting and mixed with intimidation. Reuters reported that in one war zone, Strachey, carrying a gun, went into the jungle with a group of officials to "search for guerrillas." After becoming personally familiar with the situation in Malaya, the Labour ministers had to admit that the situation was extremely serious.

The Malayan People's Liberation Army is not only fighting in the countryside, but also in urban areas. Even in cities as large as Kuala Lumpur, the British authorities do not feel safe. The united front led by the Malayan Communist Party has received the support of the broad masses of the people.

Upon returning to London, the first thing the ministers did was to request more funds for the Malayan war.

Due to the British army's significant failures in the war, the Labour government is trying to recruit mercenaries in Asian countries. For example, it is said that the Nehru government has agreed to recruit "volunteers" in India to fight in Malaya.

Duke wrote in the Manchester Guardian:

"Military police, if they cannot be found among the residents of Malaya, can be found by recruiting demobilized soldiers from India. All these people have usually been short of food and clothing for a long time, and they are accustomed to the way we are currently conducting operations in Malaya."

Recent news indicates that negotiations are underway to request the United States to supply equipment to the British army in Malaya.

In Britain, protests against the Malayan colonial war are rising. In Britain, the working people are demanding an end to the war in meetings, marches, and conferences, and are protesting against the deployment of British troops to Malaya. On June 3, the mother of a British soldier, Case Gibbons, published an open letter to Army Minister Strachey. She wrote:

"The government is prepared to use £1,000 to train my child to slaughter so-called bandits – like that ten-year-old child, whose body was burned to a crisp by the flame-throwing tanks used by the British army in Malaya. How much use would it be to use £1,000 to train my son in construction technology? As a British mother, can I let my child go to slaughter the sons of Malayan mothers in an unjust war? ... I tell you! 'My son is not an export commodity!'"

The national liberation movement of the Malayan people is part of the overall struggle of the colonial people for independence. Naturally, the victory of the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have also inspired the anti-imperialist struggle in Malaya.

At present, it is not isolated guerrillas that are fighting against the British army, but the Malayan People's Liberation Army, which is disciplined and organized under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party. It has ten regiments and operates throughout Malaya, from the Thai border to the southern coast of Johor. The strength of this army lies in its close cooperation with the people, and they are defending the vital interests of the people. Despite the British army's terror, the people support this army.

The London "Observer" quoted M. MacDonald, the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, as saying that the situation in Malaya is becoming increasingly "worse," that the People's Liberation Army is "more active" than before, that they are using "more skilled tactics than before," and that they have the support of the broad masses of the people.

Recently, the Malayan Communist Party issued a statement outlining the objectives to be achieved by the Malayan People's Liberation Army. These objectives are: to establish a Malayan People's Democratic Republic based on complete independence, national equality, and people's democracy. The statement puts forward the following program:

"Distribute Malayan land to farmers and establish agricultural cooperatives. Confiscate imperialist capital and take it over by the state. Help small Malayan capitalists. Exempt all exorbitant taxes and levies, and promote new tax laws that develop production and prosper the economy. Abolish all oppressive labor contracts and apprenticeship systems. Legally guarantee workers' wages, job security, and employment. Female workers can receive equal pay and treatment as male workers. Eliminate illiteracy, implement free education and compulsory education, and develop social welfare. Finally, establish a national army and defense force."

When Malaya is liberated from imperialist oppression and its people defeat foreign invaders and conquerors, this program for building an independent and democratic Malaya will certainly be implemented.

　　马来亚战争两年
    Ｏ·奥列斯托夫作  唐侠仞译
    两年前，一九四八年六月，英帝国主义者在马来亚发动了他们的殖民地掠夺战争。他们阴谋在“一击之下”粉碎马来亚共产党与进步工会，借以消灭民主力量的前锋并绞杀民族解放运动。
    这一挑拨阴谋已遭到了可耻的失败。二次世界大战中马来亚像其他殖民地一样，在社会上与政治上已起了变化，但帝国主义者对这些变化却判断错误了。他们没有料到人民政治觉悟的高涨与人民渴望自帝国主义压迫下获得解放的力量。最后，他们还忽视了马来亚人民在反抗日本侵略者的战争中已获得了丰富的游击战经验。
    一九四八年六月所进行的血腥挑衅并未使马来亚人民吃惊。人民抗日军战士们组成了游击队，与英国殖民者进入了公开的战斗。
    两年来，民族解放战争已扩展到了全马来亚。英工党政府竭力想粉碎与扑灭人民运动。十余万英军驻防马来亚，他们有近代化的大炮、坦克、飞机的供应。林肯式重轰炸机、吸血鬼式喷气机、山盗式轰炸机、喷火式战斗机、喷气式战斗机、火焰投射器——这些都是工党政府对马来亚人民要求自由的回答。远征军在轰炸与焚烧马来亚的村庄。凶恶的第亚克土人与廓尔喀人已被特别用来帮助消灭游击队。庄园主被授权拷打任何“有嫌疑的”马来亚人。恐怖笼罩着全马来亚。
    最初，英政府企图隐瞒真象，把马来亚的游击战士们说成为主要是由中国人组成的孤立的“恐怖分子集团”。英国反动报纸把民族解放运动描写为一小撮“土匪”的行动，而把英国的掠夺战争却描写为“恢复法律与秩序”的战争。后来，当它不再能掩饰马来亚人民是为争取民族解放而战的真象时，英国大臣们就开始声称此一民族解放运动应于最短期内予以收拾并立即把“秩序”恢复起来。
    但是两年后的今日，英帝国主义者不得不承认他们已经失败了。
    先前，英政府必须使英国工人阶级与一般舆论不了解马来亚战争的真正性质与规模。然而，现在伦敦统治集团却不得不放弃这种方针了。殖民大臣葛里菲斯于六月八日离新加坡前声称：“这是一个战争。我们将不停地、无情地继续作战，直到获得胜利为止。”
    保守党每日邮报承认：“今日局势较战争开始时更为恶劣”，该报并建议“凡看到身带武器的人”要就地射杀。
    泰晤士报也同样地异常惊慌：
    “必须承认，叛乱是一个实际的战争，它要求能集中当地的一切资源；而且必须逐步地采取各种步骤，满足马来亚人民对更大程度的自治政府的渴望。”
    这种“自治政府”的谈论并不新奇。它是英帝国主义者的惯行阴谋，目的是把殖民地人民导入岐途，在一个不同的招牌下继续保持英国的统治。英国准备向马来亚提出设立“自治政府”保证，主要目的是在诱使马来亚人民放下武器，并放弃他们争取独立的武装斗争。英帝国主义者对于即使给马来亚人民作一种纯粹口头上的让步亦是多么憎恨，可由以下每日电讯报上一文中看出：
    “英官方人士认为：充分的自治政府可能需要一个世代（三十年）才可以实现。”
    无疑地，殖民大臣葛里菲斯六月二日在吉隆坡对马来亚人民的讲话，道出了英国统治集团的真情实意。
    “我们必须取得战争的胜利，否则，无论在政治权利，宪法以及其他民主发展各方面都难以有进一步的讨论。”
    工党当局把马来亚的民族解放运动竭力宣传为并非由马来亚人所组成，而是由占全国人口百分之四十的中国人所组成，这一点意又是非常重大的。此种宣传技术，除其他目的外，打算在马来亚散播民族仇恨的种子。但是马来亚每个人都清楚地知道因保卫马来亚自由事业而被处决的第一人乃是一个曾服役于皇家空军的年青的马来亚人。每个人也都知道马来亚民主组织的领袖们曾被关入狱中，都知道远征军对马来亚农民们实行的报复行动，因为农民们藏匿了游击战士并供给他们以食粮。英军飞机在马来亚上空散布的传单，是用马来亚文印刷的，而不是用中文印刷的，而且他们的放下武器的号召是对着马来亚人发出的。
    帝国主义的宣传是无力使居住在马来亚的正为马来亚的独立而战斗的马来亚人、中国人，以及印度人的劳动人民的团结发生动摇的。而且镇压民族解放运动的英国军队也是无能为力的。在马来亚所遭受的败北正引起英国统治集团内部巨大的震惊与恐慌。橡胶与锡垄断企业的利润正处在危急关头，而此种利润则是赚取美元的主要来源，因为马来亚是世界橡胶与锡的供应地之一。
    马来亚的真正主子是英国的大亨们，诸如约翰·巴劳爵士，Ａ·麦克法迪安爵士，Ｅ麦克费丁爵士，约翰·海伊爵士，Ｊ·Ｅ·亚丁塞尔，Ｆ·Ｅ·马古里以及查理斯·马恩。
    “此七人未在内阁任职”，伦敦工人日报写道，“也没担任政府重要职务。但在国事上却不无影响，因为他们控制了马来亚六十一家主要橡胶公司中的二十五家……而且当英国人民与马来亚人民遭受苦难的时候，这些橡胶公司却攫得了巨大的利润。
    “马来亚将近四分之三的橡胶产区为欧洲人，主要是英国人所占有，据诺伊尔·贝克先生说，这些种植园总值为一亿二千万英镑。
    “马来亚六十一家橡胶公司去年获利总值为二百四十五万七千一百九十九英镑……但是英国人民为了这个战争已经付出一亿至一亿五千万英镑。假若战争不停止的话，他们还要付出一笔重大的代价。在这样的英国人民看来，英国与马来亚人民的生命每一个都是太昂贵的代价。这是我们停止出钱的时候了。”
    英国种植园主与锡矿主们是想保持他们在马来亚的资产的。殖民战争的主要挑拨者乃是吸尽马来亚脂膏的种植园主们与伦敦金融区他们的后台老板们。橡胶大亨与保守党议员佛莱彻曾对英政府称：“干脆表明，在十年以内，我们不打算退出马来亚。”
    过去三个月中，英国与廓尔喀的生力军及更多的飞机已自香港调往马来亚。英国飞机于过去一年中在马来亚出击了二千七百五十四次。
    今年二月，英国当局颁布了“剿匪月”，他们希望在“剿匪月”中征募一些当地的资产者来反对民族解放运动。但是由于人民断然拒绝参加远征军，此一罪恶的冒险不得不破产。马来亚警察头子格雷曾供认“剿匪月”在反游击队战争中，并没有多大的改进。
    现在，有一个退休的殖民地掠夺专家已成为显要人物，这个人就是布里格斯中将，他被赋予特别的权力与“剿匪作战总司令”这个阔头衔。五月末，“布里格斯计划”付诸实行。新的进攻正式宣布了。英国部队分布在截断半岛南部（柔佛州境内）的防线上。这就是想把防线推向北方进而推及全部马来亚。
    防线事实上已开始移动了，但毫无效果。一位参加此一进攻的军官写道：“在整整一周中，他的部队连一个游击队也没有遇到，仅在丛林中发现些被弃的营垒。人民解放军运用着机动的战术，实行退却，但在‘布里格斯防线’两侧却重新出现了。”报纸的报道显示着自从新攻势开始以来，游击队对英国部队、警察局与种植园的攻击日益增加，最近，报纸对布里格斯攻势却只字不提了。
    “布里格斯计划”的第二点是：加紧进行对居民的恐怖措施，将掩护或供应游击队的居民们判处死刑，并轰炸摧毁乡村。
    和平的中国居民（华侨），正被逐出该地。在中国人民革命胜利以前，英国当局把他们驱回国民党中国，他们一到那儿就会受难或是饿死的。这样被逐回国的中国农民总数就达六千四百四十四人。中华人民共和国建立以后，驱逐令虽停止了，但今天布里格斯却正把中国人民投进特别集中营。
    马来亚的进步工会已被禁止了，成千成万的爱国者被关入了监狱。葛里菲斯告下院说，自一九四八年七月起已颁布了二万五千四百八十二次拘禁令，至今年五月三十一日止，仍在拘禁中的有一万零八百五十七名。
    长时期来，由于英国在马来亚的地位益趋不利，国防大臣斯特拉彻与殖民大臣葛里菲斯乃于五月三十一日被派往马来亚了。
    在装甲车的护送下，两位大臣在好几个地区作了一次旅行，亲自发表了十二次左右的演说，演说中充满着吹牛并夹杂着恫吓。路透社消息称，在某一战区中斯特拉彻带着一支枪，同一群官员们走进丛林“搜寻游击队”。在亲身熟悉马来亚情况之后，工党大臣们就不得不承认局势是极端严重了。
    马来亚人民解放军不仅在乡间作战，而且在城市地区作战，甚至连吉隆坡那么大的城市中，英当局都觉得不安全。马来亚共产党领导下的统一战线受到了广大人民的支持。
    大臣们回到伦敦，首先着手的事情就是要求为马来亚战争拨更多的款项。
    由于英军在战争中显著的失败，工党政府力图在亚洲各国招募雇佣兵。举例来说，据称尼赫鲁政府已应允在印度招募“志愿军”赴马来亚作战。
    杜克中将在曼彻斯特卫报写道：
    “军事警察，在马来亚居民中若是找不到的话，用自印度征募退伍兵士的方法就可以找到。所有这些人们长期以来通常就缺衣乏食，而且他们习惯于我们目前在马来亚进行的作战方式。”
    最近的消息指明要求美国供给马来亚英军装备的谈判正在进行中。
    在英国，反对马来亚殖民战争的抗议日益高涨。在英国，劳动人民无论在集会、游行和会议中都要求停止战争，抗议把英军调赴马来亚。六月三日，一位英国士兵的母亲，凯斯·吉朋丝发表了致陆军大臣斯特拉彻的公开信。她写道：
    “政府准备使用一千金镑来训练我的孩子，让他去屠杀所谓土匪——像那个十岁小孩子一样，尸体被英军在马来亚使用的喷射火焰的坦克车烧得焦烂。一千金镑拿来训练我儿子的建筑技术该有多么大的用处呢？作为英国的一个母亲，我能让孩子在一个非正义的战争中去屠杀马来亚母亲们的儿子吗？……告诉你吧！‘我的儿子并不是出口货！’”
    马来亚人民的民族解放运动是殖民地人民争取独立的总斗争中的一部分。十分自然，中国人民的胜利与中华人民共和国的建立也鼓舞了马来亚的反帝斗争。
    目前，正在进行对抗英军作战的并非孤立的游击队，而是纪律严明与在马来亚共产党领导下组成的马来亚人民解放军，它拥有十个联队，在从泰国边界起直到柔佛南部海岸的全马来亚作战。这支军队的力量在于与人民密切合作，他们是保卫人民的重大利益的。尽管有英军的恐怖，人民是支持它这支军队的。
    伦敦“观察家”引用了英驻东南亚高级专员Ｍ·麦克唐纳的谈话称：马来亚局势益形“恶劣”，人民解放军较以前“更为活跃”，它们运用着“较以前更熟练的战术”，它们获有广大人民的支持。
    最近，马来亚共产党发布一项声明，阐述马来亚人民解放军作战所要达到的目的。这些目的就是：建立一个基于完全独立、民族平等与人民民主的马来亚人民民主共和国。该声明提出如下的纲领：
    “把马来亚的土地分给农民，建立农业合作社。没收属于帝国主义的资本并由国家接管。帮助小型的马来亚籍的小资本家。豁免一切的苛捐杂税，推进发展生产、繁荣经济的新税法。废除所有压迫性的劳工合同与学徒制度。依法保障工人工资与工作的安全及就业。女工可获得与男工同等的薪资与待遇。消除文盲，实行免费教育与强迫教育，发展社会福利。最后，建立一支国家军队与防御力量。”
    等到马来亚自帝国主义压迫下获得了解放，它的人民战胜了外国侵略者与征服者，这一个建立独立、民主马来亚的纲领是一定能够实行的。
