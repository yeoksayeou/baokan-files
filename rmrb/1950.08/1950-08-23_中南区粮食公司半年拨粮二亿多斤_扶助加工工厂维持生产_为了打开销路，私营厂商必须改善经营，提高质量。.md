　　Central South District Grain Company Allocates Over 200 Million Jin of Grain in Six Months
    Supporting Processing Factories to Maintain Production
    To Open Up Sales Channels, Private Factories Must Improve Management and Enhance Quality.
    [This Newspaper's Report] According to the Changjiang Daily: In order to support processing factories in maintaining production, the Central South District Grain Company allocated over 222.5 million jin of raw materials (including rice and wheat, figures for Jiangxi and Henan provinces in June are not included) to over 500 factories from January to June this year, commissioning them to process and manufacture over 153.8 million jin of finished products (including flour and milled rice). If calculated at a processing profit of one jin of rice per hundred jin of raw materials, processing factories throughout the region could obtain a profit of over 2.25 million jin. This has played a considerable role in maintaining the production of private grain processing factories in the Central South District.
    However, some problems still exist in the grain processing industry in the Central South District. The main problem is that the finished products cannot be sold. This is because the product costs are high, the quality is poor, the supply generally exceeds demand in large cities, and the purchasing power in small cities and rural areas is not high. In addition, the regulations on regional differentials still have problems, making transportation and sales unprofitable. State-owned trading departments are currently studying adjustments to price differences. However, the basic key to opening up sales channels is to reduce costs and improve quality.
    Regarding the cost issue, generally, private factories have large waste of manpower and materials, and larger non-production expenses, resulting in higher costs than state-owned factories. According to investigations, private factories require processing fees ranging from 3.1349 to 3.626 work-point units (Hankou work-point units, same below) per hundred jin of wheat processed, while state-owned factories only require 2.7572 work-point units. Further analyzing the content of processing fees, wages account for 24.4% of the processing fees in private factories, while only 18.6% in state-owned factories. Miscellaneous expenses account for 14.3% in private factories, while only 6.1% in state-owned factories. Furthermore, within wages and miscellaneous expenses, the wages of management personnel, who are non-production personnel, are higher than those of workers in private factories, and their numbers are also relatively large. For example, in the private Shengxin Flour Mill in Hankou, the ratio of production personnel to non-production personnel is four to one, while in the state-owned Wufeng Mill it is six to one. In the Fuxin Flour Mill, the lowest wage for non-production personnel is 201.08 points, and the highest reaches 641.52 points, while the highest wage for production personnel is only 189.62 points, and the lowest is only 77.22 points. This is obviously extremely unreasonable. The wage difference between staff and workers in state-owned factories is generally very small. From this, it can be seen that the key to why the costs of private factories are higher than those of state-owned factories lies here. Therefore, in accordance with the basic principles of the National Grain Processing Conference, in order to maintain the production of the rice and flour industry in the Central South District, private factories must focus on how to improve management, reduce costs, and improve quality. Only in this way can they work together with the state-owned grain company to strive to expand the market and open up sales channels.

　　中南区粮食公司半年拨粮二亿多斤
    扶助加工工厂维持生产
    为了打开销路，私营厂商必须改善经营，提高质量。
    【本报讯】据长江日报消息：中南区粮食公司为扶助加工工厂维持生产，在今年一至六月份，曾先后拨给五百余家工厂原料二亿二千五百余万斤（包括稻谷和小麦，江西、河南两省六月份数字尚不计在内），委托加工制成成品一亿五千三百八十余万斤（包括面粉和机米）。若按每百斤原料得加工利润一斤米计算，全区加工工厂即可获得利润二百二十五万余斤。这对维持中南区私营粮食加工厂的生产，起了相当的作用。
    但目前中南区粮食加工业仍存在着一些问题。主要的是生产成品销不出去。这是因为产品成本高，质量劣，大城市普遍供过于求，小城市和农村购买力不高，再加上地区差额的规定尚有问题，致运销无利可图。国营贸易部门现正研究调整差价。但打开销路的基本关键是降低成本，提高质量。
    关于成本问题，一般是私营工厂人力、物料浪费大，非生产费开支较大，比公营工厂的成本高。据调查，私营工厂每加工小麦一百斤需加工费为三点一三四九工薪分（汉口工薪分，下同），到三点六二六工薪分，而公营厂只需二点七五七二工薪分。再分析加工费内容，其中薪工一项私营支出占加工费百分之二十四点四，公营只占十八点六。杂支一项私营占百分之十四点三，公营仅占六点一。又薪工和杂支中，在私营工厂又是非生产人员的管理人员的薪工高于工人，人数也比较多。如汉口私营胜新面粉厂，生产人员和非生产人员的比例为四比一，公营五丰厂则为六比一；福新面粉厂非生产人员工资最低二○一点○八分，最高达六四一点五二分，而生产人员工资却是最高仅一八九点六二分，最低才七七点二二分。这显然是极不合理的。公营工厂职员与工人工资差额一般很小。从这里可以看出私营工厂成本高于公营工厂的关键所在。因此，如何根据全国粮食加工会议的基本方针，为了维持中南区的米面业的生产，私营厂方必须要从如何改善经营，降低成本，提高质量上着手。这样才能与国营粮食公司共同争取扩大市场，打开销路。
