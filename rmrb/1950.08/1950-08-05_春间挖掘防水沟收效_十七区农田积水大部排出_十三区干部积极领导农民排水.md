　　Spring Dredging of Flood Ditches Proves Effective
    Most of the Waterlogged Farmland in the Seventeenth District Drained
    Cadres in the Thirteenth District Actively Lead Farmers in Drainage
    [This newspaper reports] The People's Government of the Seventeenth District of the Beijing suburbs led the dredging of large flood prevention ditches this spring. Recent heavy rains have resulted in smooth drainage in the ditches and rivers, thereby reducing the flood disaster, which the farmers are fortunate for. Based on the flood situation last year, the district government used work relief this spring to lead farmers in dredging the North Xiao River and West Ba River flood prevention ditches, and mobilized farmers to dig 186 small flood prevention ditches themselves. At that time, it was estimated that the ditches could prevent flooding of more than 36,000 mu of land under normal rainfall. After the wheat harvest, there were continuous heavy rains. In late June, the district notified village governments and work teams to conduct a general inspection of the flood prevention ditches, and sent cadres from the construction section to the countryside to assist. Any improper embankments or unsmooth water flows were immediately repaired. Since July, there has been even more rainfall. On the night of the 17th, there was torrential rain for four consecutive hours, and the large and small ditches in the district overflowed their banks. Some villages were flooded, and seedlings were submerged in water, causing great panic among the farmers. The district government immediately mobilized the masses to drain the water, and by the morning of the 19th, most of the water had been drained. A total of about 10,000 mu of late-season fields in the district were affected, with minor damage to corn and sorghum fields and more serious damage to late crops. The district government is now leading the masses to drain the water accumulated in the basin, and is trying to replant or re-sow crops.
    [Another report] After the torrential rain on July 17, the water flow in the Sancha River, Xiao Bei River, and Zong Ba River in the Thirteenth District overflowed the banks in several places, flooding more than 14,000 mu of land on both sides. The district committee and district government cadres immediately led the farmers to actively rush to block the breaches, and by the 19th, all the breaches had been blocked. They also used work relief and unpaid labor to lead more than 2,700 farmers to actively drain the water. Within five days, they dug 22 drainage ditches, draining more than 9,400 mu of flooded land. The remaining flooded land is near the riverbank and must wait for the river water to recede before drainage can be carried out. Sixty-five percent of the crops flooded after the breaches have been restored to their original state. The embankments repaired after the breaches are also being continuously raised and widened to prevent future floods.

　　春间挖掘防水沟收效
    十七区农田积水大部排出
    十三区干部积极领导农民排水
    【本报讯】京郊十七区人民政府今春领导挖掘防水大沟，近日大雨，沟河排水舒畅，涝灾因之减轻，农民称幸。该区政府根据去年涝灾情形，今春以工代赈，领导农民挖掘了北小河及西坝河防涝大沟，并发动农民自己挖小防水沟一百八十六条，当时估计在一般雨量下可以免除三万六千余亩土地的涝灾。麦收后大雨不断，六月下旬通知各村政府与工作组普遍检查防涝沟，并派建设科干部下乡协助，发现堤岸不妥处或水流不畅处均立即重修。七月份以来，雨量更多，十七日夜倾盆大雨连续四小时，该区大小沟渠积水漫岸。部分村庄被淹，禾苗泡在水中，农民甚感恐慌。区政府当即发动群众排水，至十九日晨已将绝大部分积水排出，全区受害晚田共约万亩，其中玉米高粱田受害轻微，晚作物受害较重。该区政府现正领导群众排泄盆地中积水，并设法补种或重种中。
    【又讯】七月十七日倾盆大雨后，十三区三岔河、小北河、总坝河水流数处漫过堤岸，两岸有一万四千余亩土地被淹。区委会、区政府干部当即领导农民积极抢堵决口，十九日将决口全部堵塞。并用以工代赈及无代价两种方式领导二千七百余农民积极排除积水。五天内挖了二十二道泄水沟，排出水地九千四百余亩。其余涝地因近河岸，须待河水落后方能排水。决口后被淹庄稼，百分之六十五已恢复原状。决口后修复的堤岸，也正继续加高加宽，以防今后水患。              （王振忠）
