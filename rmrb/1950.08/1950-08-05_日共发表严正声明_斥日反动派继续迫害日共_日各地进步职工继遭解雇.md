Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: TASS, August 2nd: The Japanese Communist Party recently issued a statement regarding the order from the Japanese Ministry of Justice to dissolve the Shinjuku Ward Committee of the Japanese Communist Party in Tokyo and the Communist Party organization of the "Dai Nippon" Printing Company, condemning this order as a fascist act of terror that violates the Potsdam Declaration and the Japanese Constitution.

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: TASS, August 3rd, Tokyo dispatch: The operation to search for Kyuichi Tokuda and the other nine leaders of the Japanese Communist Party is currently continuing. The Japanese National Police have mobilized 25,000 people for this purpose. In Tokyo, 30 detectives are being used to search for these nine communist leaders.

The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that a reward of 100,000 yen is being offered for information leading to the whereabouts of any of the nine communist leaders.

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: TASS, August 2nd, Tokyo dispatch: Members of the Japanese Communist Party and other democrats continue to be dismissed. In Osaka, the boards of directors of three local newspapers dismissed 13 people. The Kyoto Shimbun and Kyoto Evening News dismissed 16 people. The Hakodate Shimbun in Hokkaido dismissed four people.

The manager of "Japan Electric Power Transmission" decided to dismiss more than 2,000 Communist Party members and other so-called "undesirable elements" from the company after consulting with Japanese cabinet ministers and visiting Ames, the head of the labor section of MacArthur's headquarters.

Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: After directing the Yoshida government to close down a large number of progressive Japanese newspapers and periodicals, MacArthur ordered the Japanese reactionary press authorities to dismiss a large number of journalists. According to a Kyodo News Agency Tokyo dispatch: Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, and Tokyo Shimbun, as well as news organizations such as the Japan Broadcasting Corporation, Jiji Press, and Kyodo News Agency, following MacArthur's recent directives, dismissed on the 28th a large number of personnel within their respective organizations who were regarded as "Communist Party members or sympathizers." According to preliminary statistics, more than 330 people have been unreasonably dismissed. According to the Associated Press, this wave of dismissals by various newspapers "was clearly coordinated." An executive of one newspaper told reporters that "this action was taken in accordance with the 'recommendation' of MacArthur's headquarters." MacArthur's press officer, Imborton, even bluntly admitted that he "did encourage" Japanese newspapers to "dismiss" these personnel.
