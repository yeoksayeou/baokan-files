Xinhua News Agency, August 1st—Beijing All Circles Celebrate "August 1st" Army Day Opposing U.S. Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Demonstration Rally Telegram to All Officers and Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army:

To Chairman Mao of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the People's Liberation Army, and to All Commanders and Fighters of the People's Liberation Army Comrades:

Today is the glorious festival of the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and also the glorious festival by which the entire Chinese people have gained liberation. We, on behalf of the people of all circles in the capital, extend our most sublime respect and warm congratulations to you.

Since the great leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, created this people's army, the Chinese nation and the Chinese people have been able to give the enemy increasingly powerful and fatal blows, and have definitively embarked on the road to liberation. The great history of twenty-three years proves that only when the people grasp arms and carry out armed struggle under the correct leadership of the Communist Party can they overthrow the enemies who oppress them and establish their own people's country. The entire nation will forever regard the brilliant history you have created in your twenty-three years of heroic and arduous struggle as supreme glory.

However, the victorious people will always maintain their clear vigilance. Taiwan and Tibet remain to be liberated. American imperialism is using armed intervention to prevent us from liberating Taiwan and launching a large-scale offensive against the Korean people. The bandits, secret agents, and spies organized by the Kuomintang reactionaries are still carrying out various counter-revolutionary activities against the People's Government. Therefore, we must continue to consolidate and strengthen our people's armed forces, develop a vigorous fighting will, resolutely liberate Taiwan and Tibet, resolutely oppose the aggression of American imperialism, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries, and complete the great cause of liberating all of China, building a new China, and defending world peace. The people of all of China, all of Asia, and the whole world unite together, and victory will surely belong to us.

The people of the whole country are supporting you in advancing heroically, liberating all the territory, planting the banner of victory all over every piece of the motherland's territory, and building the People's Liberation Army into a strong, modernized national defense force. Let the imperialist aggressors tremble before us, and die before us!

Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
Long live the mighty Chinese People's Army!
Long live the Chinese People's Air Force!
Long live the Chinese People's Navy!
Long live the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

　　北京各界庆祝八一示威大会
    电解放军将士致敬
    全国人民支援你们解放全部国土让侵略者在我们面前发抖、死亡
    【新华社一日讯】北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会向人民解放军全体将士致敬电：
    人民革命军事委员会毛主席、人民解放军朱总司令，并转人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    今天是我国人民解放军建军二十三周年的光辉节日，也是我国全体人民赖以获得解放的光辉节日，我们代表首都各界人民，向你们致以最崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺。
    自从中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席、朱总司令创建了这一支人民的军队，中国民族和中国人民才能日益有力地给予敌人以致命打击，才确定地走上了解放的坦途。二十三年的伟大历史证明，只有人民掌握了武装，并且在共产党的正确领导下进行武装斗争，才能打倒压迫自己的敌人，建立起人民自己的国家。你们二十三年来英勇艰苦的奋斗，今天已经获得了伟大胜利的成果，全国人民将永远以你们所创造的光辉史迹，引为无上光荣。
    但是胜利的人民，是会永远保持自己清醒的警惕的。台湾、西藏尚待解放，美帝国主义正以武装干涉阻止我们解放台湾，并向朝鲜人民大举进攻。国民党反动派所组织的土匪、特务分子、间谍分子，还在进行反对人民政府的各种反革命活动。因此，我们还必须继续巩固和加强我国人民的武装力量，发扬旺盛的战斗意志，坚决解放台湾、西藏，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略，坚决镇压反革命，完成解放全中国，建设新中国，保卫世界和平的伟大事业。全中国、全亚洲、全世界人民团结在一起，胜利是一定属于我们的。
    全国人民在支援你们，英勇前进，解放全部国土，把胜利的旗帜，插遍祖国的每一块领土，把人民解放军建设成为一支强大的近代化国防军。让帝国主义侵略者在我们面前发抖，在我们面前死亡！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    强大的中国人民陆军万岁！
    中国人民空军万岁！
    中国人民海军万岁！
    中国人民解放战争胜利万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
      北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节
      反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会
                一九五○年八月一日
