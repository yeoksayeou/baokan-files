Title: Introduction to the Security Council

The Security Council is the most important permanent body within the United Nations organization. According to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, member states of the United Nations confer on the Security Council the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility, the Security Council acts on their behalf. The Security Council therefore has broad powers. It can investigate any dispute or situation that might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute; it can determine the existence of any threat to peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression; and it can take economic and even military action to prevent or suppress acts of aggression and to maintain or restore international peace and security. In addition, the Security Council is responsible for accepting applications from new member states for admission to the United Nations, or recommending to the General Assembly the suspension of the rights of member states or even the expulsion of member states from the United Nations.

In order to ensure that the Security Council truly fulfills such important responsibilities for the general benefit of the people of the world, the Security Council is based on the principle of unanimity among the great powers as its organizational foundation. The United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that among the eleven member states that make up the Security Council, the five countries, the Soviet Union, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, should be permanent members. In addition, the United Nations General Assembly should elect six non-permanent members with two-year terms (the current six non-permanent members are India, Cuba, Egypt, Norway, Ecuador, and Yugoslavia) in accordance with the contribution of each member state to the realization of the purposes of the United Nations Charter, and after fully considering fair geographical distribution. In voting on all matters other than procedural matters, the Security Council must have the affirmative votes of seven member states, including the concurring votes of all permanent members, in order to pass. That is to say, any proposal submitted to the Security Council will be invalid as long as any one of the five countries, the Soviet Union, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, expresses its opposition.

Since the Security Council was established in January 1946, a sharp struggle between two lines has unfolded within it. The imperialist bloc, headed by the United States, has tried to turn the Security Council into a tool to facilitate its aggression. However, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have steadfastly defended the United Nations Charter, the purposes and principles of the United Nations, and have thwarted all the conspiracies of the imperialist bloc. Therefore, for a long time, they have conspired to castrate the Security Council into an organ that cannot fulfill its charter responsibilities. At previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, U.S. imperialism has repeatedly manipulated the majority to establish illegal organizations that usurp the powers of the Security Council in order to carry out its aggression plans. Among them, the so-called "Little General Assembly," established in November 1947, is the most notorious.

In October 1949, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was established, becoming the only legitimate government that can represent the Chinese people. In January of this year, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai telegraphed UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, requesting the Security Council to remove the representatives of the illegal Kuomintang reactionaries and appoint Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the People's Republic of China to the Security Council. However, this solemn and legitimate demand of the Chinese people was unreasonably rejected by the U.S.-British bloc, which deliberately undermined the United Nations. Therefore, the Soviet Union immediately announced its withdrawal from the Security Council to protest the continued attendance of the Kuomintang representatives who did not represent anyone, and solemnly declared that all resolutions passed by the Security Council without the participation of representatives from the Soviet Union and China, the two permanent members, were illegal.

Since January of this year, the imperialist bloc has not only flagrantly disregarded the illegal state of the Security Council, but has also attempted to turn it into a tool that can be used at will for its own aggressive purposes. On June 25, when U.S. imperialism provoked the war of aggression in Korea, it immediately manipulated the Security Council to hold illegal meetings and pass illegal resolutions, demanding that all member states of the United Nations support the U.S. aggressive actions and participate in the war of intervention in Korea. According to another illegal resolution, MacArthur's aggressive military headquarters has been named the "United Nations Command," and the U.S. aggressive troops in Korea have also put on "United Nations" armbands. All of this most clearly exposes the ugly face of U.S. imperialism using the United Nations as a tool for its aggression.

Now, the Soviet representative has decided to assume the presidency of the Security Council in August, and has proposed the motion of recognizing the representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as China's representative, and the motion of peacefully resolving the Korean issue. This action by the Soviet Union shows that the Soviet Union will further strive in the position of President of the Security Council to enable the legitimate representative of the Chinese people to enter the Security Council, to defend the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council, and also shows that the Soviet Union will fight in the Security Council against the attempt of the imperialist bloc to illegally steal the name of the United Nations in order to expand its aggression and war preparations. Therefore, after the Soviet representative to the Security Council, Malik, notified UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie of the Soviet decision, widespread panic broke out in the imperialist bloc. At a time when the imperialist bloc is frantically preparing for a new war, the work of the Soviet Union in the Security Council will be a major and powerful contribution to defending the United Nations and defending world peace.

### 安全理事会介绍

　　安全理事会介绍
    安全理事会是联合国组织中最重要的常设机构。按照联合国宪章的规定，联合国会员国把遵照联合国的宗旨及原则以维持国际和平及安全之主要责任，授予安理会，并同意安理会在履行此项责任下之职务时，即系代表各会员国。安理会因此具有广泛的权力，它可以调查任何争端或可能引起国际磨擦或惹起争端之情势，可以断定任何和平之威胁、和平之破坏、或侵略行为之是否存在，并可以采取经济以至军事行动以防范或制止侵略行为，以维持或恢复国际和平及安全。此外，安理会还负有接受新会员国入会申请，或建议大会停止会员国权利以至开除会员国出联合国的责任。
    为了保证安理会真正能为全世界人民的普遍利益而履行如此重大的责任，安理会以大国一致原则为其组织基础。联合国宪章明确规定，在组成安理会的十一个理事国中，苏、中、美、英、法五国应为常任理事国，除此之外，又由联合国大会按照各会员国对于实现联合国宪章宗旨之贡献，并充分斟酌地域上之公允分配，选出六个任期二年的非常任理事国（目前的六个非常任理事国为印度、古巴、埃及、挪威、厄瓜多尔、南斯拉夫）。安理会在表决除程序问题以外之一切事项时，必须有七个理事国的可决票，包括全体常任理事国之同意票，方能通过。这就是说，提交安全理事会的任何议案，只要有苏、中、美、英、法任何一国表示反对，即成为无效。
    自从安理会在一九四六年一月成立之时起，会内就展开了尖锐的两条路线的斗争。以美国为首的帝国主义集团，力图把安理会变为便利其进行侵略的工具，但是，苏联与人民民主国家忠贞不渝地保卫联合国宪章，保卫联合国的宗旨与原则，打击了帝国主义集团的一切阴谋。因此，长期以来，它们就阴谋把安理会阉割为一个不能履行宪章责任的机关。在历届联合国大会上，美帝国主义曾屡次操纵多数，成立僭夺安理会权力的非法组织，来遂行其侵略计划，其中，一九四七年十一月成立的所谓“小型联大”，就是最为臭名昭著的一个。
    一九四九年十月，中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立，成为唯一能代表中国人民的合法政府。今年一月，我外交部周恩来部长致电联合国秘书长赖伊，要求安理会开除非法的国民党反动集团的代表，并任命张闻天为中华人民共和国出席安理会的首席代表。但是，中国人民的这种严正而合法的要求，竟遭到蓄意破坏联合国的美英集团的无理拒绝。因此，苏联随即宣布退出安理会，以抗议不代表任何人的国民党代表继续出席，并严正宣布：安理会在没有苏、中两常任理事国代表参加的情形下所通过的一切决议，均属非法。
    自今年一月以来，帝国主义集团不仅悍然不顾安理会所处的非法状态，并妄图把它变为可以随心所欲地为自己侵略目的服务的工具。六月二十五日，当美帝国主义在朝鲜挑起侵略战争以后，它即连续操纵安理会举行非法会议，通过非法决议，要求联合国各会员国支持美国的侵略行为，参加对朝鲜的干涉战争。根据另一非法的决议，麦克阿瑟的侵略军司令部已被命名为“联合国司令部”，而在朝鲜的美国侵略军，也都挂上了“联合国”的臂章。这一切最明显不过地暴露了美帝国主义利用联合国为其侵略工具的丑恶面目。
    现在，苏联代表已决定在八月份担任安理会主席的工作，并已提出承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表为中国的代表案，与和平解决朝鲜问题案。苏联这一行动，表明苏联将在安理会主席的岗位上进一步为使中国人民的合法代表进入安理会，为保卫安理会大国一致的原则而努力，也表明苏联将在安理会中，为反对帝国主义集团非法盗窃联合国名义以扩大其侵略与备战行动的企图而奋斗。因此，在苏联驻安理会代表马立克把苏联决定通知联合国秘书长赖伊以后，帝国主义集团就发生了普遍的惊慌。在此帝国主义集团疯狂地准备新战争之时，苏联在安理会的工作，对于保卫联合国、保卫世界和平，都将是一个重大而有力的贡献。
