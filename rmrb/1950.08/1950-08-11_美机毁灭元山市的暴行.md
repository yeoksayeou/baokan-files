The Labor News publishes Ivanov's report
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: The Labor News recently published a message from Ivanov, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Metallurgical Workers' Union, from Pyongyang, describing the brutal acts committed by the American aggressors against the peaceful residents of Korea.

Ivanov spoke of his impressions of visiting Yuanshan City, which was savagely destroyed by the American Air Force. He described the beautiful development of this city during the five years of the existence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He wrote: During this period, perfectly equipped workers' residential areas were built in the city: thousands of new houses have been established for the working people—the masters of their country. According to the government's decision, several agricultural and educational research institutes, and five technical schools—industrial, fishery, agricultural, animal husbandry, and medical—have been established in Yuanshan. Many new primary and secondary schools, as well as three theaters, two cinemas, a sports field, and four workers' clubs have been opened one after another. The medical organization network has been greatly expanded, and two new hospitals and a tuberculosis sanatorium have also been established.

The residents of the city lived a vibrant life, working tirelessly. The people of Yuanshan have enjoyed the fruits of the people's democratic regime in their country, and enjoyed the fruits of their own selfless labor. The future development of this city is even brighter and more hopeful. The author further talked about what he saw when he arrived in Yuanshan on August 4th as a member of the Soviet trade union delegation.

Ivanov wrote: After the continuous and fierce bombing by the American Air Force, Yuanshan City has changed beyond recognition. We spent several hours walking on the ruins of the city's roads, and we were shocked by its sight. So many apartments, five hospitals, cinemas, educational institutions, etc. were bombed into ruins, which alone can give people an idea of the extent of the destruction.

We saw completely destroyed streets, thousands of new graves; we saw disabled children, women, and old people. The residents of the city accused us with the deepest anger of the Americans' bandit-like air raids.

However, Ivanov particularly pointed out: The Korean people are fully determined to carry out the war of liberation to victory. All the people are working selflessly, providing all possible assistance to the front. Regardless of the frequent attacks by American aerial bandits, regardless of all difficulties, the Korean people continue to work on their machines, continue to build air-raid shelters, and continue to take care of the wounded with kindness. Hundreds of thousands of people in Yuanshan City are actively restoring their beloved city.

　　美机毁灭元山市的暴行
    劳动报刊载伊凡诺夫的报道
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日电：劳动报顷发表苏联冶金工人工会中央委员会主席伊凡诺夫自平壤发表的一个消息，叙述美国侵略者对朝鲜和平居民所施行的残暴行为。
    伊凡诺夫说到他访问被美国空军野蛮地破坏的元山市印象。他叙述这个城市在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国存在的五年中所获得的美满发展的情形。他写道：在这个时期中，城中建筑了设备完美的工人住宅区：数千幢新的房屋已为劳动人民——他们国家的主人翁——建立起来。依照政府的决议，在元山已建立起好几个农业与教育研究所，及五个技术学校——工业、渔业、农业、畜牧、医学。许多新的初等与中等学校以及三所戏院、二所电影院、一个运动场、四个工人俱乐部均已先后开办。医务机关网已大大地扩张，二个新的医院及一个肺病医疗所也已成立。
    该市的居民过着充满活力、不倦地工作着的生活。元山人民已享受到该国人民民主政权的成果，享受到他们自己忘我劳动的果实。这个城市将来发展的前途更为光明、更有希望。作者进一步谈到他于八月四日他以苏联工会代表团团员的资格到达元山时所看到的情形。
    伊凡诺夫写道：在美国空军不断激烈轰炸以后，元山市已改变得使别人不能辨认。我们费了好几个小时，行走在这个城市的道路的废墟上，看到它的景象，真使人大为吃惊。那许多公寓、五个医院、各电影院、各教育机关等等都被炸为废墟了，仅这一点就可以使人得到毁灭程度的一个概念。
    我们看到完全被毁的街道，数千个新的坟墓；我们看到残废了的小孩、妇女与老人。该城居民以最深刻的愤怒向我们控诉美国人的强盗般的空袭。
    但是，伊凡诺夫特别指出：朝鲜人民具有全部决心，要进行解放战争到胜利为止。全体人民正在忘我地工作，以一切可能的援助供给前线。不顾美国空中强盗的经常袭击，不顾一切困难，朝鲜人民继续在他们的机器上工作，继续建筑防空壕，继续亲切地看护着受伤人员。元山市成千成万的人民正积极地恢复他们的亲爱城市。
