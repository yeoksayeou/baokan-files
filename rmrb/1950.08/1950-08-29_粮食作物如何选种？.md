How to Select Seeds for Grain Crops?
Central Ministry of Agriculture, Grain Production Department

    I. Mass Seed Selection and Retention:
    1. How to Organize? Counties can convene training classes for district industrial assistants, seed selection committee members, seed selection models, etc., for one to three days to discuss and explain seed selection methods and leadership issues. Districts or central townships convene village seed selection meetings to study seed selection methods, conduct group discussions, specifically organize seed selection work, and use various opportunities to carry out seed selection propaganda, in order to gradually cultivate the masses' conscious seed selection habits.
    2. How to Select Seeds? Field selection should be the main method. For millet, sorghum, corn, rice, etc., select ears that are large, disease-free, non-lodging, and mature uniformly; for soybeans, peanuts, and sweet potatoes, select good individual plants for seed (if field selection is not possible, field selection at the threshing ground is the minimum requirement). In addition to single harvesting and threshing for seed retention, pay attention to removing small particles, such as not using the tips and lower parts of corn kernels.
    3. Establish Seed Retention Fields: To propagate good ears (plants), it should first be started by technical groups, activists, or farmers with experience in seed selection, that is, the selected seeds should be kept separately and planted on a separate piece of land, specifically for use as seed selection fields.

    II. Evaluation Methods:
    1. Regional Scope: In old liberated areas, evaluation work can be carried out with emphasis this year to create experience. By the autumn harvest of 1951, major crops in one-sixth of the areas should have completed evaluation; by 1952, three-sixths should be completed; by 1953, all evaluation should be completed; and by 1955, a determined variety should be selected. New liberated areas should proceed according to the work foundation and specific conditions, and no tasks or time limits need be specified for the time being.
    2. How to Evaluate? Taking the administrative village as a unit, organize a seed selection committee (production committee members, labor models, technical groups, and farmers with experience in seed selection) to evaluate the best varieties of various crops in the village. When evaluating, it should be based on local needs, conditions, and the situation in recent years, and field inspections should be conducted, mobilizing farmers to compare crops and yields, determining which crops are the best, and explaining the good conditions and reasons, and studying why they are good. If there are several major crops in a village, they can be evaluated together. Fields rated as good seed fields should be encouraged to weed out impurities and inferior plants, remove diseased plants, harvest and store them separately, and collect specimens to participate in the evaluation before maturity. The county seed selection committee convenes the elected seed selection models from various townships for evaluation. The evaluation method first determines the variety that is most widely planted and generally recognized by the masses as good in the local area for the main crops of the county as the standard seed based on various conditions. Then, everyone is mobilized to evaluate the varieties with high yields, good quality, and strong resistance to local disasters and pests as the preliminary selection seeds for the county. Secondly, the evaluation work should be carried out in groups under the same conditions such as early-maturing, late-maturing, paddy field, dry land, red peel, and white peel; thirdly, under the same conditions, the evaluation principle is based on three conditions: high yield, good quality, and strong disaster and disease resistance. Those whose three conditions are all above the standard seed are rated as Grade A. Those whose first condition and one of the remaining two conditions are above the standard seed are rated as Grade B. Those whose first condition is above the standard seed and the remaining two conditions are equivalent to the standard seed are rated as Grade C.

    III. Establishing a Variety Improvement System:
    Strengthen and improve the work of agricultural farms at all levels. The provincial agricultural farm is responsible for variety improvement in the entire province. Each year, it should conduct thorough investigations and research in the evaluation areas to understand the characteristics and cultivation methods of the preliminary selection seeds, and promptly organize the preliminary selection seeds to participate in trials at the provincial agricultural farm, and combine them with newly cultivated varieties in this field and existing excellent varieties introduced from outside areas to conduct variety comparison trials. Variety comparison trials should not only be conducted at the provincial farm, but also can be entrusted to branch farms or propagation farms when necessary. After the final selected seeds are produced, they are distributed to agricultural farms in each special county according to the plan for propagation, and regional trials are conducted at the same time to determine whether they are indeed excellent and suitable for local cultivation, and then they can be promoted to seed retention sites. This means that, at the current stage, the breeding work of agricultural farms must be based on mass seed selection. The varieties cultivated by agricultural farms will undoubtedly be higher than ordinary preliminary selection seeds, and in the future, new varieties cultivated using scientific methods will be continuously participating in variety comparison trials. Through continuous seed selection, breeding, promotion, and two-way exchanges, various crops can be continuously improved and popularized. Therefore, each province needs a sound provincial agricultural farm, and the provincial agricultural farm is responsible for directing the propagation and experimentation work of agricultural farms in each special district. The special district agricultural farm guides the work of the county agricultural farms under its jurisdiction, and the county agricultural farm guides the work of village seed retention sites. Agricultural farms at all levels must report to higher-level agricultural farms regularly. Higher-level agricultural farms need to send personnel to guide the work from time to time. In this way, agricultural farms have upper and lower level connections, and the provincial farm has a comprehensive understanding of the experimental demonstration situation in various places, and can provide each other with experimental materials and information.

    IV. Propagation and Promotion System and Seed Retention Fields:
    1. Propagation System: The provincial farm propagates seeds for planting by special district farms, the special district farm propagates seeds for propagation by county farms, and the county farm propagates seeds for seeds for seed retention fields. If agricultural farms at all levels feel that the propagation land is insufficient, they must organize specially contracted farmers to propagate, and the produced seeds must be weeded out and inspected to be qualified. The current task of the special county agricultural farm is mainly to propagate good varieties and play a demonstrative role in the local area. Therefore, the crops planted by the propagation farm must exceed the crops planted by ordinary farmers in the local area.
    2. Promotion System: Before the final selected seeds are distributed, the county promotion farm can use the county's preliminary selection seeds or excellent varieties that have been inspected and promoted by the provincial farm for propagation and promotion. Within the scope of a county, the propagation and promotion work is the responsibility of the county government. After the good seeds are harvested, they are exchanged with farmers' public grain with an additional premium, and the masses are organized to exchange them according to the additional premium. The principle between collection and exchange is to neither profit nor lose. Within each township and several administrative villages, the principle of mutual exchange by the masses is followed, but it needs to be organized by the village seed selection committee to ensure that good seed households receive certain benefits and are not harmed. Outside the scope of a county, the seed organization is responsible, and the principle is to purchase the final selected seeds. Before the final selected seeds are produced, improved varieties or the best of the preliminary selection seeds that have been inspected can be purchased. The purchase quantity should not exceed the quantity required by each agricultural farm. Only when demonstration has been carried out or the masses already have planting experience, have faith in good seeds, and request promotion can demonstration promotion be carried out to seed retention sites. Outside the scope of a province, the transfer of excellent seeds needs to be submitted to the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the Greater Administrative Area Department of Agriculture and Forestry for approval, so as to avoid the spread of pests and diseases by randomly transporting seeds.
    3. Establishing Village Seed Retention Sites: The village seed retention site is the foundation of promotion, and the quantity to be set up should be determined based on the quantity of seeds, the crop's propagation ability, and the village's crop cultivation area. The number of seed retention sites in a village should be based on the principle that the seeds produced can be popularized within two years, that is, the preliminary selection seeds of 1950 will be used for seed retention fields in 1951, and the seeds produced in seed retention fields in 1951 will be promoted to one-half of the area of the village, and can be popularized in another year. The seed retention field has a demonstration effect in the village, so it must organize labor production and encourage activists who improve technology to take on the task, and it must be meticulously cultivated and continue to be carefully selected to achieve continuous improvement and improvement of varieties. However, the establishment of seed retention sites must be based on the level of awareness of the masses and the work foundation. In the new liberated areas where land reform has not been implemented, general establishment is not possible. To do a good job in seed retention sites, it is necessary to ensure that the farmers in seed retention sites do not suffer losses, and to give them appropriate rewards such as additional premium purchases, priority in enjoying agricultural loans, and participation in evaluation if their achievements are excellent.

　　粮食作物如何选种？
    中央农业部粮食生产司
    一、群众选种留种：１、如何组织？县可招集区实业助理员、选种委员会委员，选种模范等，开一天到三天的选种训练班，讨论和讲述选种办法和领导等问题。区或中心乡招集各村选种会议，研究选种方法，分组讨论，具体组织选种工作，并利用各种机会，进行选种宣传，以便逐渐养成群众自觉的选种习惯。２、如何选种？以田间选种为主。粟、高粱、玉米、水稻等，选穗大、无病、不倒伏、成熟一致的穗子；大豆、花生、甘薯选好的单株作种（如作不到田间选，最低要作到场选）。除单收单打留种外，并注意去掉小的粒子，如玉米不要尖端和下部的粒子。３、设留种田：选好穗（株）繁殖，应先由技术小组、积极分子，或对选种有经验的农民开始，即将选出的种子单留出来另种在一块地上，专做为选种田。
    二、评选办法：１、地区范围：老区今年可有重点地进行评选工作，创造经验，至一九五一年大秋，主要作物完成评选六分之一的地区，一九五二年完成六分之三，一九五三年全部完成评选，至一九五五年选出决定品种。新区按工作基础和具体情况进行，可暂不规定任务与时间。２、如何评选？以行政村为单位，组织选种委员会（生产委员、劳模、技术小组及对选种有经验农民参加），评定本村各种作物最优良品种。在评定时，应根据当地需要、条件及近几年情况决定，并应到田间检查，发动农民比庄稼、比产量，确定那些庄稼是最优良的，并说明好的条件、理由，研究他为什么好。在一村如有几种主要作物，可一齐评出，被评为优良种田，即动员本户至成熟前去杂去劣，拔除病株，单打单存，及采集标本参加评选。县选种委员会召集各乡当选的选种模范，进行评选。评选办法首先根据各种条件，把全县主要作物在当地种植最多，且群众公认为良好的品种定为标准种，然后发动大家评选产量高品质好，抵抗当地的灾害及病虫害能力强的，为本县的初选种。其次，评选工作应根据早熟、晚熟、水地、旱地、红皮、白皮等同样条件分组进行；第三、在同样条件下，评选原则以产量高品质好，抗灾抗病力强三个条件为主。三个条件都在标准种以上者为甲等。第一条件和其余两条件中之一在标准种以上为乙等。第一条件在标准种以上，其余两条件相当于标准种者为丙等。
    三、建立品种改良制度：加强并健全各级农场工作。省农场负全省品种改良之责，每年要在评选地区充分调查研究，了解初选种特性及栽培方法，及时组织初选种到省农场参加试验，并结合本场育成新品种及现有的外区引进的优良品种进行品种比较试验。品种比较试验，不仅在省场进行，必要时可委托支场或繁殖场进行。决选种产生后，即按照计划分配各专县农场进行繁殖，同时进行区域试验，决定确属优良而适于当地栽培，即可向留种地推广。这就是说，在现阶段农场的育种工作，一定要建立在群众选种基础上。农场培育出的品种，无疑的要高于一般初选种，将来并要用科学方法育成的新品种，不断的参加品种比较试验。这样不断的选种育种和推广，上下交流，各种作物就可不断的得到继续提高与普及。因此，每省需有一个健全的省农场，省农场负责指挥各专区农场的繁殖试验工作。专区农场指导所属县农场工作，县农场指导各村留种地工作。各级农场必需向上级农场作经常报告。各上级农场需时常派员指导工作。这样，农场有上下级的连系，对各地试验示范情况省场有全面了解，可相互供给试验材料和情况。
    四、繁殖推广制度和留种田：１、繁殖制度：省场繁殖种子供各专区场种植，专区场繁殖种子供各县场繁殖，县场繁殖种子供留种田用种子。各级农场如感繁殖地不足时，须组织特约农户繁殖，所产种子必须经过去杂去劣，经检定合格。专县农场在现阶段的任务，主要是繁殖良种，要在当地起示范作用。因此，要求繁殖场种植的作物，一定要超过当地一般农民种植的作物。２、推广制度：各县推广场，在决选种未分配下来以前，可用本县初选种或经省场检定推广的优良品种进行繁殖与推广。在一县范围以内，其繁殖推广工作由县政府负责。良种收获后以农户好公粮加成收换，并组织群众按加成数换出。收换之间以不赔不赚为原则。在各乡及几个行政村之内以群众互换为原则，但需由村选委会组织，保证良种户得到一定好处和不受损失。在一县范围以外，由种子机构负责，以收购决选种为原则。在决选种未产生前，可收购经过检定的改良品种或初选种中最优良者。收购数量以不超过各农场所需数量为原则，只有已经示范或群众已有种植，对良种有了信仰，要求推广才可以向留种地作示范推广。在一省范围以外，优良种子调剂需呈请中央农业部及大区农林部批准，以免随便调运种子传播病虫害。３，设置村留种地：村留种地是推广的基础，设置数量应根据种子数量作物繁殖能力及本村作物栽培面积来决定。一村留种地数量以产生种子能在二年内普及为原则，即五○年初选种要供一九五一年留种田用，一九五一年留种田产生种子推广到本村二分之一面积，再一年可达到普及。留种田在村有示范作用，因此必须组织劳动生产，改进技术的积极分子来担任，并一定做到精耕细作，继续精选以达到品种不断提高与改良。但留种地设置，须根据群众觉悟程度及工作基础建立，在未实行土改的新区一般不能普遍建立。为作好留种地，必须保证留种地农民不吃亏，并予以加成收购、优先享受农贷、成绩优良者参加评选等适当奖励。
