　　Anhui Xuancheng Special District Directly Subordinate Organs
    Studying Documents by Quibbling Over Words and Phrases, Inspecting Work by Avoiding the Important and Dwelling on the Trivial
    General Study Committee Has Proposed Corrective Measures Respectively
    [Our Newspaper News] The rectification movement of the directly subordinate organs of Xuancheng Special District, Anhui Province, and various counties began successively after the Prefectural Committee mobilized for rectification in early July. According to reports from various localities, the following deviations occurred during this period of studying documents and inspecting work: (1) The phenomenon of studying documents for the sake of studying documents was very serious. The focus was mainly on nitpicking over the text, chewing on nouns. Some people discussed what is meant by "the masses"? Some people discussed why the word "de" (的) was used in this place instead of "di" (地)? Some people counted how many "isms" there were, etc. Secondly, the group study meetings turned into rambling talks or idle chats, talking about everything under the sun. One group went from rectification to the Marriage Law, to the issue of love between men and women. Or there was nothing to say, one group of six people discussed and ended after saying only four sentences in total. (2) When combining with the inspection of work, they did not offer opinions to each other, or did not talk about facts. As soon as they approached "actual matters," they turned, evaded, and went around in circles. When examining their own work, they also talked about some shortcomings in a perfunctory manner, avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial; or they exaggerated and reviewed some details of their lives, and then added a label of "...I committed such and such an ism" to scare people and act as a shield. To this end, the General Study Committee of the Special District convened a meeting of cadres from various directly subordinate organs of the Special District on August 9th, and Comrade Zhang Siqi, Deputy Director of the Study Committee, gave another rectification report. In addition to pointing out the above deviations and their causes in the report, he particularly explained that the success or failure of rectification is related to the success or failure of the overall economic construction work and land reform work. Therefore, it is necessary to seriously rectify the work style, inspect work, and improve work. He put forward the following suggestions for future rectification: (1) Correct the attitude of study, overcome the deviations of drilling into sentences, quibbling over words and phrases, and chewing on nouns. Studying documents must be combined with the inspection of work. After shifting to the inspection of work in the future, focus on inspecting work, summarizing work, and improving work. (2) Strengthen the leadership of various groups. The Study Committee should convene meetings of group leaders regularly to understand the dynamics of each group. (3) The focus and center of rectification should be determined according to the characteristics of the work of each department. (4) Emphasize that the principal leader is responsible and takes the initiative to ensure that the rectification is smoothly carried out to its completion.

　　安徽宣城专区直属机关
    学习文件中咬文嚼字  检查工作时避重就轻
    总学委会已分别提出纠正办法
    【本报讯】安徽宣城专区直属机关与各县的整风运动，自七月初旬经地委整风动员后，即先后开始整风。据各地报告，在这一段学习文件与检查工作中，发生了以下几个偏向：（一）在学习文件时就文件学习文件的现象非常严重。主要是在文字上打圈子，啃名词，有些人讨论什么叫“群众”？有些人讨论为什么这个地方用“的”字而不用“地”字？有些人统计有多少个“主义”等……。其次把小组的学习会变成漫谈会或闲谈会，海阔天空的乱谈，有一个小组从整风谈到婚姻法，谈到男女恋爱问题。或者是无话可说，有一个小组六个人讨论总共说了四句话就结束了。（二）在结合检查工作时，彼此不提意见。或不谈事实。一接近“实际事情”就转弯、回避、兜圈子。在检查自己工作时，也是如此轻描淡写，避重就轻地谈一些缺点；或者把生活细节拿来夸大检讨，然后自己加上一个“……我犯了什么什么主义”的帽子，好吓唬人，也好作挡箭牌。为此，该专区总学委会于八月九日召集专区直属各机关干部集会，由学委副主任张思齐同志再作整风报告。在报告中除提出以上偏向和它的原因外，并特别说明了整风的好坏，是有关全面经济建设工作和土改工作的成败的。因此，必须认真的整顿作风，检查工作，改进工作。他对今后整风提出了下面几点意见：（一）端正学习态度，克服钻文句，咬文嚼字，啃名词等偏向，学习文件必须结合检查工作，今后转入检查工作后，就着重检查工作，总结工作和改进工作。（二）加强对各组的领导，学委会应按期经常召集小组长会议，以了解各组动态情况。（三）应按各部门工作情况特点，确定整风的重点与中心。（四）强调首长负责，亲自动手，使整风顺利开展到圆满完成。
