　　Everything for the Frontline
　　By Jie Bapov, Soviet Union
　　These days, Pyongyang is living a tense military life. Sandbags filled with yellow river sand are placed on rooftops and sidewalks. Paper strips are pasted on the windows of houses. Every evening, the streets are immersed in darkness. Searchlights constantly caress the sky. On the roofs of houses, volunteer self-defense forces—anti-aircraft fighters—are on duty all night. Severe hardship has tempered the Korean people's will to resist and their courage in struggle.

　　Thousands upon thousands of patriots are requesting to volunteer for the front lines. In their applications, they write: "We do not want to be slaves of the United States, we do not want Americans to stay in Korea, we have already recognized what American civilization is." Tens of thousands of women and young people have entered factories and mines. Everyone has only one hope—how to do better and completely replace the fathers and brothers who have joined the army.

　　The victories of the People's Army have inspired the residents of Pyongyang, and they are working selflessly to ensure the needs of the front lines.

　　Everything for the front line, everything for victory! This slogan is written on a long red cloth, fluttering in front of the Pyongyang light bulb factory. All the employees of the factory warmly welcomed Premier Kim Il-sung's letter to the people on mobilizing all forces to support the front lines at a mass meeting. The workers unanimously decided to work two hours overtime every day.

　　In February of this year, the female workers of the light bulb factory went to the cultural center to attend classes and learned about the working methods of Valentina Khlisanova, a female Stakhanovite worker in Moscow, with great interest. In the experimental workshop, the excellent work team is called the Khlisanova work team. Soon the entire factory switched to working according to hourly plans.

　　After the publication of Kim Il-sung's letter to the people, fifteen frontline youth work teams were organized in the enterprise, and the young people are working hard. Work team member He Annan (transliteration) formulates personal obligations before work, and generally these obligations are systematically exceeded.

　　Many female workers in the enterprise are improving their skills and mastering a second specialty, so that they can replace other comrades when needed. Factory Director Qiao Yinchun (transliteration) said when talking about all the staff in the factory:

　　"Although many skilled workers have voluntarily gone to the front lines, and despite the American bombers' air raids, the factory still completed and even exceeded the state plan well. This is the result of the selfless labor of our people. The creative application of the experience of Soviet production innovators has also been of great help to us. The example of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War against the German aggressors and their heroic labor have inspired the Korean workers."

　　In the Huanghe Metallurgical Plant in Sanning (transliteration) City, a factory-wide workers' conference was held not long ago. Chen Duren (transliteration), chairman of the trade union, called on workers to widely adopt the methods of Soviet steelworkers. The metallurgical workers of Huanghai have already become familiar with the experience of Nikolai Noskov, a steelworker at the Moscow "Hammer and Sickle" factory and a Stalin Prize winner. They adopted his method and extended the working life of boilers during major repairs. Guo Lixin (transliteration), an excellent steelworker in the Martin furnace workshop who won a medal from the Ministry of Industry, said while describing his experience in learning from the advanced working experience of the Soviet Union:

　　"We should work better now in order to ensure the supply of high-quality steel to the front lines."

　　At the meeting, the workers of the metallurgical plant discussed the experience of the advanced workers with the attitude of masters, and determined methods to speed up the smelting and measures to improve the strength of the boilers.

　　At the meeting, many people took on tasks that had been raised. In the mechanical workshop of the factory, I met a girl working on a lathe. Her name is Yun Chunming (transliteration), she is twenty years old, and this is her first year working in the factory. She began her labor life after the Soviet army liberated Korea: she first worked in the Women's Federation, then in the publishing bureau of the Labor Party, and came to the factory in July 1949. She studied the machine tool very well, and she can also adjust the parts if they are faulty. Recently, Yun Chunming increased the speed of perforation, while she used to make fifteen parts, but now she has increased it to twenty to twenty-five.

　　Yun Chunming, like other men and women workers in the workshop, is very concerned about everything that happens in the factory, the situation on the front lines, and the lives of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. In her free time, she also studies in a nursing training class. Yun Chunming is proud of completing her work no less than men. She feels that she is a fully equal citizen of a democratic republic fighting for freedom and independence.

　　In the Qingjin (transliteration) Metallurgical Plant, women have completely replaced the jobs of men who have gone to the front lines. The young people in the coking workshop voluntarily work one hour overtime every day for the front lines. The number of female workers in the electrical industry is increasing day by day. Almost all enterprises in the region have established nurseries and kindergartens.

　　The slogan "Everything for the Front Line" has become the law of the working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The miners of Donbass (transliteration) produce 40% more ore every day than in June. Li Hanpo (transliteration), a coal miner at the Kiyul (transliteration) Coal Mine, is the most beloved. His work team has completed 250% of its task since the first day of the war.

　　These days, all the working people of the Republic are united around the idea of fighting for independence and unity. People on the front lines and in the rear are all fighting for freedom and independence.

　　一切为了前线
    苏联  节巴波夫
    在这些日子里，平壤过着紧张的军事生活。在房顶上和人行道上，躺着已经装好了黄色河砂的麻袋。各家的窗户上都贴上了纸条。每到傍晚，街道便浸沉在黑暗中。探照灯不时地抚摸着天空。在各家的屋顶上，整夜都有志愿自卫队——防空的战士值班。严重的患难锻炼了朝鲜人民反抗的意志和他们在斗争中的英勇。
    上千上万的爱国者，请求志愿上前线。在申请中他们写道：“我们不愿做美国的奴隶，我们不愿美国人留在朝鲜，我们已经认识了什么是美国的文明”。千千万万的妇女和少年走进了工厂和矿山。大家只有一个希望——怎么能做的更好，完全来代替已加入军队的父老兄弟。
    人民军的胜利鼓舞了的平壤的居民，为了保证前线的需要，他们忘我地劳动着。
    一切为了前线，一切为了胜利！这一号召写在一幅长长的红布上，飘扬在平壤电灯泡工厂的门前。全厂职工，在群众大会上热烈欢迎朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首相金日成关于动员一切力量支援前线的告人民书。工人们一致决定每天加班两小时。
    在本年二月里，电灯泡工厂的女工到文化馆去听课，以极大兴趣的心情去了解莫斯科女斯达哈诺夫工作者瓦琏吉娜·赫利萨诺瓦的工作方法。在试验车间里优秀的工作队，被称为赫利萨诺瓦工作队。很快全厂都转入了按每小时计划而工作着。
    金日成的告人民书发表之后，在企业里组织了十五个前线青年工作队，青年们都紧张的工作着。工作队员赫安南（译音）在工作之前制定个人义务，一般地这些义务都系统地被超过了。
    企业里许多女工正在提高自己的技术，掌握第二种专业，以便在需要的时候来代替别的同志们。厂长乔荫椿（译音）谈到全厂工作人员时说：
    “虽然，很多熟练工人都志愿地走上了前线，尽管美国轰炸机在空袭，工厂仍很好地完成了、甚至超过了国家计划。这就是我们的人忘我劳动的结果。创造性的运用苏联生产革新者的经验，对我们的帮助也不少。苏联人民在反对德国侵略者的伟大的卫国战争中的范例及其英勇的劳动鼓舞了朝鲜的工人。”
    在三宁（译音）市内的黄河冶金厂里，不久前召开了全厂工人大会。工会主席陈都仁（译音）号召工人广泛地采用苏联炼钢工人的方法。黄海的冶金工人已经熟习了莫斯科“镰刀斧头”工厂的炼钢工人、斯大林奖金获得者尼古拉·南斯诺克夫的经验。他们采用了他的方法，扩大了大修期间的锅炉工作期限。马丁炉车间的优秀的、获得工业部奖章的炼钢工人郭立新（译音），一边叙述学习苏联先进工作经验一边说：
    “我们现在应更好的工作，以便保证供给前线高等质量的钢。”
    在会议上，冶金厂的工人，以主人翁的态度讨论了先进者的经验，确定了能够快速出炉的方法和提高锅炉的坚固性等措施。
    在会上，很多人就承担起来已被提高了的任务。在工厂的机械车间里，认识了一个在旋床上工作的姑娘。她叫云春明（译音），二十岁，这是第一年在工厂工作。苏军解放朝鲜以后，她才开始了自己的劳动生活：起初她在妇联工作，以后在劳动党的出版局，一九四九年七月来工厂。她很好地研究了机床，机件如有毛病，她也会调整。最近云春明增加了穿孔的速度，同时过去做十五个零件，而现在则提高到做二十到二十五个。
    云春明像车间内其他男女工人一样，非常关心厂内发生的一切，前线的情况，苏联和新民主主义国家的生活。在自由时间里，她还在护士训练班内学习。云春明以完成自己的工作并不次于男人而自豪。她感到自己是为自由与独立而斗争着的民主主义人民共和国的完全平权的公民。
    在庆金（译音）冶金工厂由妇女完全顶替了走上前线去了的男人的工作岗位。炼焦车间的青年每天志愿地为前线加班一小时。电气工业里边的女工数字，在日益扩大着。差不多在该道的全部企业里都建立了托儿所和幼稚园。
    “一切为了前线”的口号，已经成了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动人民的法规。顿巴（译音）的矿工，每天出产的矿石比六月份高百分之四十。基尤尔（译音）煤矿的挖煤工人李汉坡（译音）最受敬爱。他的工作队从战争的第一天起，就完成了任务的百分之二百五十。
    在这些日子里，共和国的全体劳动人民都团结在为独立为统一的战斗的思想周围。前线和后方的人们都一致地在为自由与独立而斗争着。
