Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 24th: The electrical manufacturing industry in Northeast China, which originally had a very weak foundation, has now taken shape after a year of active restoration and transformation. Based on the principle of possible specialization, Northeast China has now formed nine electrical manufacturing plants, with nearly 10,000 employees. The number of product types has increased from 147 at the end of last year to 315, many of which could not be manufactured independently during the puppet Manchukuo period and relied on imports from Japan. For example, AC and DC voltage and ammeters are now produced in quantities that not only meet the needs of Northeast China but also supply part of the country. The pressure resistance of insulating porcelain has increased from 6,600 volts during the puppet Manchukuo period to 77,000 volts, and its output has more than doubled. The output of electric motors in the first half of this year exceeded one and a half times the total output of last year, and the horsepower has more than tripled. The output of electric wires also increased by more than double when comparing June of this year with September of last year.

During the puppet Manchukuo period, although there were more than a dozen electrical manufacturing factories in Northeast China, they were all affiliated with Japanese domestic electrical enterprises and only manufactured some scattered parts and a large number of small products. Not only were basic products such as generators unable to be manufactured, but even electric motors above 300 horsepower, electrical appliances with more complex structures, and even basic electrical raw materials such as yellow wax cloth, mica sheets, bakelite sheets, and insulating paper had to be imported from Japan. In addition, the severe damage suffered before and after the Japanese invaders surrendered reduced the electrical industrial manufacturing capacity of Northeast China by as much as 90% compared to the puppet Manchukuo period. Currently, the electrical industry in Northeast China has been restored and built under the above-mentioned difficult conditions.

　　东北电器工业现已粗具规模
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】原来基础极薄弱的东北电器制造工业，经一年来积极恢复和改造，现已粗具规模。根据可能专业化的原则，目前东北已组成九个电器制造厂，职工近一万人，产品种类由去年底的一百四十七种增达三百一十五种，其中许多是伪满时不能自制而仰赖日本输入的。如交流及直流电压、电流表，现自制产量除东北需用外，并供应关内一部分。绝缘磁的耐压力已由伪满时的六千六百伏特提高到七万七千，其产量更增加了两倍半。今年上半年电动机的产量超过去年全年一倍半，其马力数更超过三倍。电线产量，以今年六月与去年九月比较，也增加一倍多。
    伪满时期，东北虽有十余个电器制造工厂，但都附属于日本国内的电器企业体系，仅仅制造一些零星配件和大量小型产品，不仅发电机一类的基本产品不能制造，连三百马力以上的电动机，构造较精密复杂的电器，甚至如黄腊布、云母板、胶木板、绝缘纸等电器基本原材料，都需由日本输入。加以日寇投降前后遭受严重破坏，东北的电器工业制造能力较伪满时减低了达百分之九十。目前，东北的电器工业就是在上述困难条件下恢复和建设起来的。
