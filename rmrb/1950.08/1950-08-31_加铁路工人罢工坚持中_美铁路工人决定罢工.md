Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: According to a United Press report, two major American railway unions ordered their railway workers on August 23rd to hold a nationwide strike starting on August 28th. The Railway Employees Brotherhood and the Railway Trainmen Brotherhood, with a combined membership of hundreds of thousands, decided on this strike to demand shorter working hours and increased wages. The two unions issued the strike order after two weeks of unsuccessful negotiations with railway companies under government auspices.

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: According to a United Press Montreal dispatch: The nationwide strike of 127,000 Canadian railway workers, which began on August 22nd, is still ongoing. Striking workers declared on August 24th that they would continue to fight for increased wages and shorter working hours "regardless of any government efforts to force a return to work." The strike has hit the Canadian government's aggressive rearmament plan. A naval spokesman said that the strike has "seriously affected" warship construction work at eight shipyards. He said that if the strike cannot be resolved within the next week, all shipbuilding work will be suspended. Employers across the country are using the strike as an excuse to lay off workers in large numbers, and it is estimated that 260,000 people will be unemployed by the end of this week.

　　加铁路工人罢工坚持中
    美铁路工人决定罢工
    【新华社二十五日讯】据合众社报道，美国两大铁路工会于二十三日下令所属铁路工人于二十八日起举行全国性罢工。合共拥有数十万会员的铁路员工兄弟会和铁路车务员兄弟会所决定的这次罢工，是为要求缩短工作时间和增加工资。两工会系在政府主持之下与铁路公司进行两周谈判而无结果之后发出罢工令。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据合众社蒙特利尔讯：二十二日开始的加拿大全国十二万七千铁路工人大罢工仍在坚持中。罢工工人二十四日声称，将“不顾政府强迫复工的任何努力”，继续为要求增加工资及缩短工作时间而斗争。罢工已打击了加拿大政府侵略性的重整军备计划。海军方面发言人称：罢工已“严重地影响”了八个船坞的战舰建造工作。他说，下周内罢工如无法解决，造舰工作将全部停工。全国各地雇主借口罢工大批解雇工人，估计本周末将有二十六万人失业。
