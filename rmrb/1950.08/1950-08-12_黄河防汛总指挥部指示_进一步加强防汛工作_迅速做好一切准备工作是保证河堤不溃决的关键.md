Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 11th—After preliminary inspection of the Yellow River flood control work, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters recently issued instructions to further strengthen flood control work. The instructions pointed out: Now is the rainy season, and floods may arrive at any time. Rapidly completing all preparations for flood control is key to ensuring that riverbanks do not breach.

The instructions described the progress of the current Yellow River flood control work: Since the establishment of the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters in late June, the people along the river, under the leadership of the People's Government, have respectively inspected the dikes, found many hidden dangers and weaknesses in the strength of the dike and dam revetments, and are now carrying out remedial work. The long-term flood control personnel, who have been mobilized and selected, have already gone to the dike lines.

The instructions continued to point out that although the flood control work in various places along the river has made achievements, the following issues urgently need to be resolved:

First, flood control work must be deeply rooted among the masses. The commandism of some cadres must be severely criticized. According to various materials, the current flood control work is basically still limited to district and village cadres, and the broad masses have not been fully mobilized. Many people still have a paralyzing mentality toward flood control work. However, some cadres adopted compulsory measures when solving the above-mentioned ideological problems of the masses, and as a result, this approach failed. However, some cadres have adopted methods such as visiting, holding forums, and citing examples of disasters through various organizations to enlighten the masses, enabling them to consciously and actively take action. Facts have proven that counties and sections that follow this path are successful.

Second, eliminating hidden dangers in the dike body is work that cannot be delayed any longer. According to preliminary understanding, many ditches and wave nests along the river have not been repaired. More seriously, the dikes above the dams in Henan and Pingyuan have many hidden dangers. Preliminary inspection has revealed 1,298 badger and fox burrows; furthermore, some dam revetments do not meet the required standards for repair and may not be able to withstand the scouring of floods. Therefore, it is necessary to conscientiously and rapidly carry out a comprehensive inspection of the dikes in accordance with the instructions of the Central Flood Control Headquarters and completely eliminate hidden dangers in the dike body in the shortest possible time.

Third, all preparatory work must be completed quickly. Some cadres believe that summer grain collection cannot be carried out if flood control is carried out, and other work cannot be done if flood control is carried out. Due to this single-minded work style, coupled with the actual difficulty of having few cadres and many tasks, some flood control headquarters exist in name only, and flood control work is extremely superficial. Some cadres also seriously neglect advance organizational preparations. This is a kind of paralyzing mentality due to insufficient understanding of the characteristics of the Yellow River, and it should be corrected immediately. Conscientiously counting tools and materials, repairing flood control shelters, strengthening communication between superiors and subordinates, and strengthening special prevention work are necessary conditions to ensure that river dikes do not breach.

Fourth, clear rewards and punishments, the implementation of performance evaluation systems, and the launching of labor competitions are also important conditions for overcoming floods.

### 黄河防汛总指挥部指示  进一步加强防汛工作  迅速做好一切准备工作是保证河堤不溃决的关键

　　黄河防汛总指挥部指示
    进一步加强防汛工作
    迅速做好一切准备工作是保证河堤不溃决的关键
    【新华社开封十一日电】黄河防汛总指挥部于初步检查了黄河防汛工作后，最近发出进一步加强防汛工作的指示。指示指出：目前正在雨季，洪水有时刻到来的可能，迅速做好防汛的一切准备工作，是保证河堤不溃决的关键。
    指示叙述目前黄河防汛工作进展的情形称：自六月下旬黄河防汛总指挥部成立后，沿河人民在人民政府领导下，分别进行了堤防检查，发现不少隐患及堤线坝埽强度不够的弱点，现正进行补救工作。经过动员与选拔的长期防汛员，已经开赴堤线。
    指示继指出，目前沿河各地防汛工作虽已有了成绩，但还存在以下几项问题急待解决：
    第一、必须把防汛工作深入到群众中去。部分干部的命令主义，必须严加批判。根据各方材料，目前防汛工作基本上还停留在区、村干部中，广大的群众还没有全面发动起来，许多群众对于防汛工作还存在着麻痹思想。但有些干部在解决群众上述思想问题时，则采用强迫命令办法，结果这种作法是失败的。但也有些干部采取了通过各种组织，以访问座谈、举出被灾实例的方法，启发了群众思想，使群众自觉地积极行动起来。事实证明，凡走这样道路的县段都是成功的。
    第二、消灭堤身隐患是不容再缓的工作。据初步了解，沿河许多水沟浪窝还没有修补。更严重的是河南及平原坝头以上大堤，隐患甚多，经初步检查，即发现獾狐洞达一千二百九十八个；并且有的坝埽不够应修标准，可能经不住洪水的冲刷。因此，必须认真地迅速地遵照中央防汛总指挥部的指示，进行普遍的堤防大检查，在最短时间内彻底消灭堤身隐患。
    第三、必须迅速完成一切准备工作。有些干部认为作夏征就不能搞防汛，搞防汛则不能做其他工作。由于这种单打一的工作方式，再加上干部少任务多的实际困难，有的防汛指挥部是有名无实，防汛工作极不深入。还有部分干部严重忽视事先的组织准备工作。这是对黄河特点认识不足的一种麻痹思想，应当立即纠正。应认真地点验工具料物，修好防汛屋庵，密切上下级联系，加强防特工作，是保证河堤不生溃决的必要条件。
    第四、奖惩严明，推行考绩制度，开展劳动竞赛，也是战胜洪水的重要条件之一。
