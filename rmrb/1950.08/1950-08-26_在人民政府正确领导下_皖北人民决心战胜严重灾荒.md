　　Under the Correct Leadership of the People's Government,
    The People of Northern Anhui are Determined to Overcome the Severe Famine
    Actively carrying out drainage and replanting, work-for-relief programs, and social mutual aid will enable ten million disaster victims to survive the next ten months of famine.
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The work of rescuing disaster victims in the Huai River-affected areas of northern Anhui has been basically completed. A production and disaster relief campaign is now underway, combined with long-term production and disaster relief plans based on fundamental Huai River management. The Northern Anhui Administrative Office clearly put forward the principle of "Protect the South, Rescue the North" at the Water Conservancy and Disaster Relief Conference on August 3rd, meaning that the areas south of the Huai River that have not been affected by the disaster should be protected from further breaches to ensure the autumn harvest; while the flood-stricken areas of northern Anhui should launch production and disaster relief work. Currently, the disaster area is mainly focused on drainage and replanting (low-lying areas are not planted to avoid repeated planting and repeated flooding). The Northern Anhui Administrative Office requires all disaster-stricken areas to strive for a minimum of 9 million mu of late autumn replanting; it would be even better if 13 million mu could be achieved. A drainage and replanting campaign is now being launched with all efforts. The focus is on planting pumpkins, rapeseed, turnips, and various green vegetables, and each person is required to constantly maintain a small vegetable plot to solve some of the living problems of the disaster victims. In addition, organs and troops in northern Anhui have begun a "one or two meters" movement to save grain for disaster relief. If calculated over ten months, it is estimated that more than 2.8 million catties can be saved. Furthermore, preliminary plans are being made to combine with the fundamental Huai River management project, implementing work-for-relief programs. It is planned to mobilize 1.5 million able-bodied laborers and 1 million semi-able-bodied laborers this autumn and next spring to participate in the Huai River management project. Assuming each person excavates an average of one cubic meter of earth per day, 250 million cubic meters of earth can be moved in one hundred days. If calculated at 4.5 catties of wage grain per cubic meter (the wage grain per cubic meter can provide for the living of four people), it is estimated that this will enable ten million disaster victims to overcome the severe famine in the next ten months.

　　在人民政府正确领导下
    皖北人民决心战胜严重灾荒
    积极进行排水抢种、以工代赈、社会互济，将使一千万灾民度过今后十个月灾荒。
    【本报讯】皖北抢救淮河沿岸被淹地区灾民工作，已基本完成，现正展开生产救灾运动，并结合根本治淮计划，作长期生产救灾打算。皖北行署在八月三日的水利、救灾会议中，明确提出了“南保北救”的方针，即淮河以南未受灾地区，应保住不再决堤，以确保秋收；淮北水灾区则展开生产救灾工作。目前灾区主要是排水补种（洼地不种，免受连种连淹之损失）。皖北行署要求全部受灾区争取最低补种晚秋九百万亩，如能达到一千三百万亩更好。现正全力展开排水补种运动。以种葫萝卜、菜子、芜青及各种青菜为主，并要求每人经常保持种一分菜地，以解决部分灾民生活问题。又皖北各机关部队已开始一两米运动，节约救灾，如以十个月计，约可节省二百八十余万斤。此外并初步计划结合淮河治本工程，以工代赈，准备在今年秋后及明春，动员一百五十万全劳力，一百万半劳力，参加治淮工程。以每人每天平均挖一土方计算，一百天可做二亿五千万土方。如以每土方四斤半工资粮计算（每土方工资粮可供四口人生活），估计将可使一千万灾民战胜今后十个月的严重灾荒。
