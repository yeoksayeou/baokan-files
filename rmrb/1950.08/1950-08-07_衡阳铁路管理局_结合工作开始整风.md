Hengyang Railway Administration
    Begins Rectification Campaign Combined with Work

    [This newspaper dispatch] The Hengyang Railway Administration Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions for a cadre rectification campaign. These instructions were made based on the spirit of the rectification instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and were made in response to the specific situation in the Hengyang railway district. The instructions affirmed the achievements, but also pointed out that serious problems exist among cadres, such as underestimating workers' rationalization proposals. After explaining the important significance of the rectification campaign, the instructions stipulated that the rectification must be carried out from top to bottom, starting with leading organs and leading cadres, then general party members and non-party cadres, and finally a joint meeting of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league should be held to summarize the third quarter production. On-site rectification will be carried out in the form of checking and summarizing the third quarter production meeting. Cadres will also make personal ideological summaries based on the meeting summary. After the instructions were issued, all branches held discussions, divided into groups, and began studying the documents.

　　衡阳铁路管理局
    结合工作开始整风
    【本报讯】中共衡阳铁路管理局委员会，最近发布了干部整风指示。这一指示是根据中共中央及中共中央中南局关于整风指示的精神，针对衡阳铁路区具体情况作出的。指示中肯定了成绩，同时也指出了在干部中严重地存在着轻视工人的合理化建议等问题。指示中说明了整风的重要意义后，并规定：整风必须自上而下进行，首先由领导机关，领导干部做起，然后一般党员及非党干部，最后开党、政、工、团联席会议，总结第三季生产。现场整风以检查、总结第三季生产会议的方式进行。干部并根据会议总结作出个人的思想总结。指示发布后，各支部均曾进行讨论，划分小组，开始学习文件。
