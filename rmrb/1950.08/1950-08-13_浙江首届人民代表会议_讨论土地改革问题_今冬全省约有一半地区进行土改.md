　　Zhejiang's First People's Representative Conference
    Discusses Land Reform Issues
    Land Reform to be Implemented in Approximately Half of the Province This Winter
    【Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 11th】 The first Zhejiang Provincial People's Representative Conference was held from the 1st to the 8th. The conference elected the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee. The conference determined the future work guidelines and tasks for Zhejiang Province, and focused on discussing various issues related to the implementation of land reform in Zhejiang Province this winter. Prior to this, three municipalities directly under the province and fifty-four counties had successively held people's representative conferences from one to four times, laying the foundation for this provincial people's representative conference.

    After discussions in plenary sessions and group meetings, the conference unanimously approved the report by Tan Zhenlin, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government, on "Overview of the Work of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government in the Past Year and Future Tasks." The conference believes that the basic tasks of Zhejiang Province in the future are: to consolidate the achievements of unified financial and economic work and overcome difficulties in economic transformation; to resolutely eliminate bandits and special agents; to strive to strengthen coastal defense and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan; and to carry out land reform work in a planned and orderly manner.

    Based on the report by Tan Qilong, Deputy Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, on "Striving to Complete the Task of Land Reform Throughout the Province in a Planned and Orderly Manner," the conference conducted extensive and in-depth discussions on the issue of carrying out land reform throughout the province. The conference studied the general situation in the province: Currently, about 20% to 30% of the areas in the rural areas of the province have basically met the conditions for land reform; about 40% to 60% of the areas in the province do not yet fully meet the sufficient conditions for land reform and need to intensify work within the next eight, nine, or thirteen months to meet the conditions of the former type of areas; and another 15% to 20% of the areas still require a longer period to carry out bandit suppression, anti-hegemony, and rent reduction movements in order to mobilize and organize the peasant masses to create the necessary conditions for land reform. Based on the above situation, the conference decided: It is planned to strive to carry out land reform in 35 to 55 counties throughout the province after the autumn harvest this year. These areas account for approximately 2,650 villages, accounting for 50% of the total area of the province, with a population of approximately 11 million, accounting for 65% of the rural population of the province. The remaining areas, accounting for about half of the province's area and 35% of the rural population, must complete all preparations for land reform before the autumn harvest next year before land reform can be carried out. The conference decided: It is planned to strive to basically complete the great historical task of land reform throughout the province before the spring plowing of 1952. The conference conducted detailed discussions on the steps and methods for completing the task of land reform throughout the province in a guided, planned, and orderly manner. The representatives unanimously supported carrying out land reform throughout the province and guaranteed its implementation.

    Finally, after full democratic discussion and deliberation, the conference elected Tan Zhenlin as the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, and Tan Qilong, Wu Xian, He Xiehou, and Tang Yuanbing as vice-chairmen, and forty-eight members.

　　浙江首届人民代表会议
    讨论土地改革问题
    今冬全省约有一半地区进行土改
    【新华社杭州十一日电】浙江省首届各界人民代表会议于一日至八日举行。会议选出浙江省首届各界人民代表会议协商委员会主席、副主席和委员。会议确定了浙江省今后的工作方针与任务，并着重讨论了浙江省在今冬实行土地改革的各项问题。在此以前，全省已有三个省直辖市和五十四个县先后举行了一次到四次的各界人民代表会议，为这次省各界人民代表会议奠定了基础。
    会议经过大会和小组讨论后，一致通过了省人民政府谭震林主席关于《浙江省人民政府一年来工作概况和今后任务》的报告。会议认为今后浙江省的基本任务是：巩固财经统一工作的成绩，克服经济改造中的困难；坚决肃清土匪特务；努力加强海防，支援人民解放军解放台湾；有步骤、有秩序地进行土地改革工作。
    会议根据中共浙江省委副书记谭启龙关于《为有步骤有秩序地完成全省土地改革任务而奋斗》的报告，对在全省范围内进行土地改革工作问题，进行了广泛和深入的讨论。会议研究了全省一般的情况是：目前，全省农村约有百分之二十到百分之三十左右的地区已基本上具备了土地改革的条件；全省约百分之四十到百分之六十的地区，目前尚未完全具备土地改革的足够条件，需要在八、九、十三个月内，加紧工作，才能具备前一类地区的条件；另有约百分之十五到百分之二十的地区，还需要一个较长时间去进行剿匪、反霸、减租等运动，从而发动和组织农民群众创造土地改革的必要条件。依据上述情况，会议决定：拟争取今年秋收后在全省三十五个县到五十五个县进行土地改革，这些地区，约计有二千六百五十个乡左右，占全省总面积的百分之五十，人口约一千一百万，占全省农村人口的百分之六十五。其余全省约有一半面积的百分之三十五农村人口的地区，须待明年秋收前完成土地改革的一切准备工作后再进行土地改革。会议决定：拟争取于一九五二年春耕以前，基本上完成全省土地改革的伟大历史任务。会议对如何有领导、有计划、有秩序地完成全省土地改革任务的步骤与方法等，均进行了详尽的讨论。代表们一致拥护在全省范围内进行土地改革工作，并保证其贯彻执行。
    最后，会议经过充分的民主讨论和酝酿，选出谭震林为浙江省首届各界人民代表会议协商委员会主席，谭启龙、吴宪、何燮侯、汤元炳为副主席及委员四十八人。
