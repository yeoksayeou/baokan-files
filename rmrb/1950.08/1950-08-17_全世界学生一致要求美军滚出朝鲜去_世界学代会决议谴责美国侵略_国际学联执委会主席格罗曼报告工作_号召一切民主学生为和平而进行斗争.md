Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th. The Second World Student Congress, held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, heard the report by IUS Executive Committee Chairman Grossman on the work of the current Executive Committee and its future tasks on the 14th and 15th. The congress began discussions on the 15th.

On the afternoon of the 14th, when Grossman pointed out in his report that "U.S. troops get out of Korea" has become the common demand of students worldwide, and paid tribute to the heroic Korean student representatives, the hall erupted in thunderous cheers of "Long Live Kim Il-sung." Representatives from various countries swarmed the Korean delegation, presenting them with flowers and lifting them high, parading around the hall for half an hour. When Grossman reported that the liberation struggles of the colonial peoples and the anti-fascist struggles of the European people were continuing to develop, the representatives cheered and lifted the representatives of Vietnam, Malaya, Spain, and Greece, parading them around the hall for a long time. This caused Grossman's report, originally scheduled to end on the 14th, to be completed only on the 15th.

Grossman reported on the main achievements of the IUS in the past four years in the struggle to win student rights and improve student living conditions in capitalist and colonial countries, pointing out that the activities of the IUS have been conducted within the international scope to fight against reactionary forces and forces of war, and have been bravely and persistently striving for the cause of peace.

Grossman sternly condemned the American aggression against Korea, and stated: "We, representing the democratic students of the world, jointly declare with all peace-loving people: No interference in Korea!"

Regarding the future tasks of democratic students worldwide in striving for peace, Grossman emphasized that peace committees must be established in every university, every department, and even every dormitory. Students must step up their participation in the organizational work of national or local peace movements, and must strengthen ties with cultural and scientific workers and other peace advocates. Students in the United States, Britain, and Scandinavia, in particular, should participate more actively in the peace movement.

In discussing the solidarity of the international student movement in detail, Grossman requested the congress to once again call on all honest, peace-loving students to unite within the IUS and fight for common interests, and called on groups that have already withdrawn from the IUS to return to the IUS.

Grossman finally emphasized that the main task facing the IUS and various democratic student groups is to fight for peace. All honest students should participate in this struggle without exception.

Korean delegation leader Kang Buk spoke at the meeting on the 15th. He said that the 15th was the fifth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Korea, and paid tribute to the great Soviet people and the great Stalin. The entire audience stood up and cheered for the great Stalin for a long time. Kang Buk then reported on the crimes of the American aggressors and the heroic struggle of the Korean people. When he finished his speech, representatives from various countries swarmed the podium and competed to embrace the Korean representatives, expressing their respect and love for them. The hall was filled with cheers. The congress then, at the proposal of the Italian student representative, passed a resolution condemning American aggression against Korea.

Also speaking at the meeting on the 15th were Czechoslovak Minister of Education Nejedlý, and student representatives from Tunisia and Algeria.

　　全世界学生一致要求美军滚出朝鲜去
    世界学代会决议谴责美国侵略
    国际学联执委会主席格罗曼报告工作  号召一切民主学生为和平而进行斗争
    【新华社布拉格十六日电】在捷克斯洛伐克京城布拉格举行的世界学生第二届代表大会，于十四、十五两日听取了国际学联执委会主席格罗曼关于本届执委会的工作和今后任务的报告。大会于十五日开始进行讨论。
    在十四日下午，当格罗曼在报告中指出“美军滚出朝鲜去”已成为全世界学生的共同要求，并向英勇的朝鲜学生代表致敬时，会场爆发了雷动的“金日成万岁”的欢呼声。各国的代表一齐拥向朝鲜代表团，向他们献送鲜花，并将他们高高举起，绕行会场达半小时。当格罗曼报告到殖民地人民的解放斗争和欧洲人民的反法西斯斗争正在继续发展时，代表们又欢呼着把越南、马来亚、西班牙和希腊的代表抬起来绕行会场良久。这样就使得原定在十四日结束的格罗曼的报告，延至十五日才进行完毕。
    格罗曼报告了国际学联过去四年来，在争取资本主义及殖民地国家的学生权利与改善学生生活条件的斗争中所获得的主要成就，指出国际学联的活动，是在国际范围内进行了反对反动势力与战争势力的斗争，并且一直在勇敢而且坚持地为和平事业而奋斗。
    格罗曼严正斥责了美国对朝鲜的侵略，并称：“我们代表全世界的民主学生，与一切爱好和平的人民共同宣称：不许干涉朝鲜！”
    关于全世界民主学生今后争取和平的任务，格罗曼着重指出在每一个大学、每一个学系、以至每一个寄宿舍里，都必须成立和平委员会。学生们必须加紧参加全国的或地方的和平运动的组织工作，必须加强与文化科学工作者及其他和平拥护者的联系。美国、英国和斯堪的纳维亚各国的学生，尤其要更积极地参加和平运动。
    格罗曼在详论国际学生运动的团结时，要求大会再度号召一切正直的、爱好和平的学生团结在国际学联之中，为共同的利益而进行斗争，并号召已经退出国际学联的团体再回到国际学联来。
    格罗曼最后强调指出国际学联和各民主学生团体所面临的主要任务，是为和平而进行斗争。一切正直的学生，应当无例外地参加进这一斗争中来。
    朝鲜代表团团长康北十五日在会上发言。他说十五日是苏军解放朝鲜五周年纪念日，特向伟大的苏联人民和伟大斯大林致敬。会众全体起立，长时期地为伟大斯大林欢呼。康北继报告了美国侵略者的罪行和朝鲜人民的英勇斗争。当他结束讲演时，各国代表一齐拥向讲坛，并争着去拥抱朝鲜的代表们，向他们表示崇敬与热爱。会场上一片欢呼。大会继在意大利学生代表的提议下，通过了谴责美国侵略朝鲜的决议。
    在十五日会上发言的尚有捷克斯洛伐克教育部长尼耶德利，和突尼斯与阿尔及利亚的学生代表。
