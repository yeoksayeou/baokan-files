Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The First National Health Conference, which opened in Beijing on the 7th, lasting thirteen days, closed on the 19th. Health workers from all regions who attended the conference had extensive and in-depth discussions on the current national health work in a united and harmonious atmosphere. Finally, the conference unanimously agreed on "Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers," "Prevention First," and "Uniting Chinese and Western Medicine" as the three guiding principles of health work in New China.

The conference analyzed the health situation in old China, which was characterized by a large population, many diseases, and a shortage of medical care. The reactionary government's neglect of health work left the Chinese people with endless harm. In particular, the vast number of workers and peasants were almost permanently isolated from health and medical services, resulting in rampant epidemics and alarming mortality rates. The conference believes that this situation must be changed in the future. Health workers must mobilize the national laboring people to fight against diseases so that the most populous workers and peasants can be healthy and ensure the development of economic construction. In this struggle, health work has a great role to play. The basic principle of health work is to ensure health, not to rescue after illness, so we must adhere to "prevention first." In our work, we must focus on relying on the masses and giving them health education.

The conference believes that the principle of "prevention first" should first target the diseases that are most harmful to the masses. For diseases such as smallpox, infant tetanus, cholera, and plague, we must immediately organize universal prevention and eliminate them completely or substantially on a regular basis; for the prevention of tuberculosis and other diseases, we must also start pilot projects with key points, and then promote them nationwide after gaining experience.

The conference believes that establishing grassroots health organizations at all levels across the country is a necessary condition for meeting the health needs of the masses. Therefore, we must strive to ensure that within three years, most counties in the country have health centers with two to seven specialists and a pharmacist or dispenser; districts have health stations with one to two medical assistants and one midwife, and villages have health workers; factories, mines, and neighborhoods should also have health organizations.

The conference believes that in order to meet the broad needs of health cadres, medical education should adopt a three-level system of higher, secondary, and primary education, and a specialized key-point system for higher education. The most urgent task at present is to run secondary medical schools in various parts of the country to train a large number of intermediate health cadres such as medical assistants, midwives, and nurses in a relatively short period of time. Secondly, training rural health workers and reforming old midwives is also an important task at present.

The conference believes that traditional Chinese medicine has a long history in China, a large number of practitioners, and widespread distribution. It is an indispensable force for protecting the health of the Chinese people today and must be supported and preserved for a long time, so that it can learn scientific theories and help them sort out their experience. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine refresher schools will be held in provinces and administrative regions, and a traditional Chinese medicine research institute will be established in the central government. Western medicine must also pay attention to the living habits of the Chinese people and learn from the style of rural Chinese medicine in approaching the masses. It is especially important for Chinese and Western medicine to unite closely under the goal of serving the people.

The conference pointed out that China's military health work has a glorious history, and its direction is the direction of national health work. In the future, the main task of military health work is to improve the cultural and theoretical level of cadres.

In addition, the conference also reached unanimous and practical opinions on issues such as rectifying hospitals, the rational division of labor between public and private medical institutions, the exchange and cooperation of health workers, and the self-sufficiency of drug production.

The conference made specific resolutions on the issues discussed, and will separately recommend that the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Health of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission submit them to the Government Administration Council and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission for approval before notifying the country for implementation.

At the end of the conference, telegrams were passed to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and condemn the crimes of American imperialism in invading Taiwan and Korea and protecting Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals. All participants signed the Declaration to Defend World Peace.

Through this conference, there will be further links between various health workers across the country, between Chinese and Western medicine, and between public and private health institutions. The conference also issued a "Letter to National Health Workers," calling on national health workers to unite and fight for the implementation of the three guiding principles of health work.

　　第一届全国卫生会议闭幕
    一致同意以“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”、“团结中西医”为卫生工作三大原则。
    【新华社十九日讯】第一届全国卫生会议，自七日在京开幕，历时十三日，于十九日闭幕。与会的各地卫生工作者曾在团结和谐的情况下就目前全国卫生工作作了广泛、深入的讨论。最后会议一致同意以“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”、“团结中西医”为新中国卫生工作的三大原则。
    会议分析了旧中国的卫生情况，是人口多，疾病多，医药少；而过去反动政府忽视卫生工作更给中国人民留下了无穷的毒害，尤其广大的工农劳动人民几乎长期与卫生医药事业隔离，造成疫病丛生，死亡率惊人。会议认为这种情况今后必须改变，卫生工作者要发动全国劳动人民与疾病作斗争，使中国人口最多的工农大众得到健康，并以此保障经济建设的发展。在这一斗争中，卫生工作是有极大作用的。卫生工作的基本原则是保证健康，而不是病后抢救，所以必须以“预防为主”。在工作中要着重依靠群众，给群众以卫生教育。
    会议认为：“预防为主”的方针，应首先针对为害群众最大的疾病。如对天花、婴儿破伤风、霍乱、鼠疫等病，要马上组织普遍的预防，定期予以全部或大部的消灭；对结核病等的预防，也要开始重点试行，等到取得经验，再推广全国。
    会议认为：建立全国各级基层卫生组织，是解决群众卫生需要的必要条件。因此必须努力争取在三年之内，基本上使全国大部分的县有二个到七个专科医师、一个药师或调剂员的卫生院；区有一个到两个医士，一个助产士的卫生所，乡村有卫生员；工矿街坊也都要有卫生组织。
    会议认为：为适应卫生干部的广大需要，在医学教育上应采高、中、初三级制和高级的分科重点制。目前最迫切的是在全国各地举办中等医科学校，以便在较短期内培养大批的医士、助产士、护士等中级卫生干部。其次培养乡村卫生员与改造旧产婆也是目前的重要工作。
    会议认为：中医在中国历史长、数量大，分布普遍，对于今天在保障中国人民的健康是不可少的一种力量，必须长时期地加以扶植、保存，使其学习科学的理论，帮助他们整理经验。因此要在省、行政区举办中医进修学校，中央则将成立中医研究所。西医也必须注意中国人民的生活习惯，学习农村中医接近群众的作风。而中西医一起在为人民服务的目标下紧密团结尤为重要。
    会议指出：中国的军队卫生工作是有光荣的历史的，它的方向就是全国卫生工作的方向。今后军队卫生工作主要地是提高干部的文化与理论水平。
    此外会议对整顿医院、公私医疗机构的合理分工、卫生工作人员的交流与合作、药品的生产自给等问题，也都获得一致的切实可行的意见。
    会议对于讨论的问题，都作出了具体的决议，将分别建议中央人民政府卫生部及人民革命军事委员会卫生部呈请政务院及人民革命军事委员会批准后通告全国予以实施。
    会议最后分别通过了向毛主席致敬，谴责美国帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜及庇护日本细菌战犯的罪行等电文。与会者全体在保卫世界和平宣言上签了名。
    经过这次会议，全国的各种卫生工作者之间，中西医之间，公私营卫生机构将有更进一步的联系。会议还发出了“告全国卫生工作者书”，号召全国卫生工作者一致为实施卫生工作的三大原则而斗争。
