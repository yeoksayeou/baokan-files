　　Introducing a Batch of Soviet Economic Construction Books (Part 1)
　　Liu Jichen
　　Currently, there are not enough books published on Soviet economic construction, and I have read even fewer. I will only introduce the limited number of books I have read, separately, to provide readers with convenience in their selection. Before introducing them, I would like to clarify two points: First, in some of the books I introduce, I will not only recommend good books but also criticize those with shortcomings. Second, I will introduce them according to the nature of the books, first on Soviet economic system and economic methods, second on Soviet planned economy and economic planning, third on Soviet economic accounting, fourth on Soviet enterprise leadership methods, fifth on Soviet collective farms, and sixth on finance, banking, and currency. Now, let me introduce them in order:

  I  On Soviet Economic System and Economic Methods
　　The great achievements of Soviet economic construction were forged by several Stalin Five-Year Plans; the implementation of a planned economy must rely on economic methods, and economic methods are inseparable from the law of value under the socialist economic system. Therefore, when we study Soviet economic construction, it is also necessary to first understand its economic system and the law of value. Now, let me introduce a few pamphlets on this topic:

　　《On the Soviet Economic System》 Compiled by Chen Shan and Li Zheng, published by the Dalian-Soviet Friendship Association
　　《The Methods of Soviet Industrialization》 By Leontiev, printed by Xinhua Bookstore

　　The commonality of these two books is that they both made a comparative analysis of the law of value under the Soviet socialist system and the law of value under the capitalist system, and clarified the superiority of the former. Since the Soviet Union overthrew the capitalist private economic system and established a socialist economic system with public ownership of the means of production, all economic laws have undergone an essential change in this economic system, transforming the law of value, which massively wastes social productive forces in capitalism, into a tool for planned economy; transforming the irrational distribution principle of capitalism into the socialist principle of distribution according to labor; and transforming the law of expanded reproduction in the periodic crises of capitalism into a law where economic production relations are fully adapted to the nature of productive forces, that is, into a law of expanded reproduction without economic crises and with constantly rising productive forces. At the same time, these books also pointed out that these changes are by no means fabricated out of thin air, but are inherent laws of the Soviet socialist economic system itself. In addition, the first book also introduces the socialist production methods of the Soviet Union, such as reducing product costs, the socialist emulation movement, collective contracts, and the cultivation of reserve labor forces. The second book, based on the theories of Lenin and Stalin, analyzes the methods of Soviet industrialization. It explains the superiority of the Soviet industrialization methods, especially focusing on the two issues of the direct start of heavy industry in the Soviet Union and the sources of funds for socialist industry.

　　In addition, there is another pamphlet worth reading, namely:

　　《The Role of Socialist Transformation in the Soviet Economy》 Translated by Kong Kejia, published by Writer's House

　　This book explains the great organizational and driving force of the Bolshevik and Soviet government policies in Soviet economic construction. Without them, the success of Soviet economic construction would be unimaginable. Secondly, it explains that the Soviet people regard the national economic plan as the law of the state, and they all regard the task of implementing and completing the economic plan and observing labor discipline as their own obligations.

  II  On Soviet Planned Economy and Economic Planning
　　《The Socialist Industrialization of the Soviet Union》 By Kashimovsky, printed by Xinhua Bookstore

　　This book first introduces the backwardness of industry in Tsarist Russia thirty years ago, analyzes the formulation of the Soviet national electrification plan and its significant meaning, the path of industrialization, the main links in the development of heavy industry, and the sources of funds, etc. Secondly, it narrates the basic milestones of industrialization—the First Five-Year Plan, the Second Five-Year Plan, and the Third Five-Year Plan; then it analyzes the amazing strength that the Soviet Union possessed before World War II and exerted during the war. Finally, it analyzes the development, achievements, and future limitless prospects of the post-war New Five-Year Plan. This book clearly and correctly narrates and clarifies the whole picture of the development process of the Soviet Union's several Five-Year Plans.

　　There is also a book called 《The Soviet Union is a Powerful Industrial Country》 (by Rosenke, published by Xinhua Bookstore), the content of which is roughly the same as the book above. However, this book was published during the Soviet Patriotic War, so it is not as complete as the former; moreover, some of the wording (e.g., page 54) is no longer suitable for the current situation because times have changed.

　　There is also a book called 《The Path of Soviet Industrialization》 (by Laokaisheng, translated by Zhang Xinhua). The content of this book is the same as the above two books, but it combines the strengths of the above two books and is a relatively complete good book. Another book of the same nature, called 《An Outline History of Soviet Industry》 (by Brower, translated by Ke Ang, both of the above two books were printed by Tianxia Book Company), the content is also good, but the materials are limited to before 1937.

　　In addition, there is a book by Zheng Hongshu called 《The Soviet Planned Economy》 (published by Shanghai Magazine Company). This book is written in a simple and popular way, and the viewpoints are also correct, but there are many shortcomings. For example, in the second section of the first chapter, "Characteristics of Planning," it only points out the "guidance—academic—comprehensiveness—political—practicality" of planning and does not mention several quite important points such as regularity and democracy; in the fourth chapter, "The Development of the History of the Soviet Planned Economy," it does not explain the Soviet national electrification plan proposed and decided by Lenin and its significant meaning; in narrating the three Soviet Five-Year Plans, it rarely talks about the increase in Soviet workers' wages and the improvement of their cultural life; and when talking about the Soviet Patriotic War, it does not appropriately show the enthusiastic and great strength exerted by the planned economy and the working masses.

　　The above are all general reading materials. Below we will introduce some more specialized books:

　　《Resolutions of the Communist Party on Economic Construction Issues》 (Part 1) Printed by Xinhua Bookstore
　　《The New Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union》 Printed by Northeast Bookstore

　　The first book is about economic construction during the New Economic Policy period, and the second book introduces the post-war New Five-Year Plan. The translation of these two books is not very good, but they are still valuable for reference. The former book is extracted and translated from the book 《Resolutions of the Communist Party at Various Meetings》, focusing on the resolutions on economic construction issues during the period of national economic recovery (1921-1925). This book points out that during this New Economic Policy period, the Soviet Union's primary focus was on constructive recovery, so the task at that time must first develop agriculture and break down the barriers between urban and rural areas to lay the foundation for industrialization. This book also points out that planned economic work is not isolated, and must take into account the connections in all aspects, otherwise, even a slight deviation will lead to significant errors and affect the entire planning work. These are all worth learning from. This book introduces a lot about the Soviet cooperative cause, with a total of 178 pages, of which 32 pages are dedicated to Soviet cooperatives, and many more are scattered throughout the book, so I hope comrades engaged in cooperative work will read it.

　　Since the implementation of the New Economic Policy, the Soviet Union has undergone three Five-Year Plans of economic construction and has begun to advance towards the road of communism, but the Patriotic War has greatly affected this advance. After the victory of the Soviet Patriotic War, it immediately transformed the wartime economy, re-embarked on peaceful economic construction, and stepped onto the road leading to communism. The new task put forward during this period was to restore the devastated areas of the country and restore the pre-war level of industry and agriculture in the five years from 1946 to 1950, and then surpass this level on a large scale. For example, the New Five-Year Plan stipulates that "in the last year of the Five-Year Plan for the revival and development of the Soviet national economy... the total industrial output of the Soviet Union... will increase by 48 percent compared to the pre-war year of 1940," "the development of total agricultural products will increase by 27 percent compared with 1940 at the end of the five-year period," regarding the plan to improve the material and cultural standards of people's lives, it stipulates that "during the five-year plan period, on the basis of increasing production, developing commodity trade, and increasing the expenses of workers' housing and cultural life services, not only will the pre-war level of people's welfare be restored, but also the pre-war level of national income will be increased by more than 10 percent." The above second book mainly introduces the regulations of the New Five-Year Plan, and it is a good material for studying the Soviet post-war New Five-Year Plan. All comrades who learn from the Soviet experience in economic construction should read this book.

　　So, how does the Soviet Union formulate its economic plan? This is a very important question for us when learning from the Soviet experience in economic construction. Now let us further introduce a few books on this topic:

　　《The Design of the Soviet National Economy》 By Walsky, translated by Tianma, published by Times Publishing House
　　《How the Soviet Union Formulates Industrial Production Plans》 By A. Yoffe, printed by Northeast Xinhua Bookstore
　　《How to Make a Plan》 Compiled and printed by Northeast Xinhua Bookstore

　　The three books listed above are all good books that we must read to learn from Soviet economic construction. The first book is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is "The Role and Task of Soviet Planning the National Economy." This chapter first explains the prerequisites for socialist planning: "The political and economic prerequisites for socialist planned economy are the working class's control of political power, the abolition of capitalist private property, and the establishment of public ownership of the means of production." But "planned economy is not achieved overnight after the October Socialist Revolution, it grows and develops in the fierce struggle against the internal and external enemies of the Soviet state and the socialist system, and it has to overcome great difficulties on the road." "Now, socialist planning, as a huge organizational force for the economic development of the socialist motherland, has penetrated the lives and habits of millions of Soviet people." It also says: "The purpose of planned economy is to eliminate unemployment," which is something that capitalist countries cannot do. After the Second World War, the market in capitalist countries has been greatly reduced, production has decreased, and the number of unemployed workers has increased. These countries are of course incomparable with the Soviet Union, which has long eliminated unemployment, and even with the new democratic countries. Because the new democratic countries already have the conditions for planning, "the plans of the new democratic countries have smoothly solved their post-war demobilization and development problems in accordance with the interests of their people on a solid foundation of political and economic independence," "although their planned economy differs from the Soviet socialist plan in terms of development level and other characteristics. The working people's control of political power, the nationalization of large-scale industry and banks, and the implementation of land reform have enabled these new democratic countries to plan the revival of the national economy at the highest speed, eliminate economic and technological backwardness, and ensure the independence of each country in accordance with the interests of the people." This correctly explains the planning conditions of our new democratic countries and the superiority of our new democratic countries over capitalist countries. Secondly, when talking about planning as the law of Soviet economic development, it says: "Based on the knowledge of the laws of social and economic development, the Soviet state applies planning to give these laws the expected effect," "the socialist national economic plan is based on the profound scientific foresight of social development, and this foresight is based on the knowledge of socialist economic laws." It also says: "The main driving force of socialist planning is the Bolshevik Party, which is armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism and is the guiding core of the organization of the working people in the social and government aspects." Finally, regarding the basic task of socialist planning, it says: "The basic task of socialist planning, that is, the basic condition for the existence and development of the Soviet economy, is to strengthen the autonomy and independence of our economy from the capitalist world." The second chapter is "The Development of the Soviet National Economic Plan," which introduces the early years of socialist planning, the electrification plan, the plan for the period of recovery, the three Five-Year Plans, the plan for the period of the Patriotic War, and the post-war New Five-Year Plan in accordance with historical development. The third chapter is "Principles for Formulating the National Economic Plan," which first explains the economic and political tasks and the main links of the national economic plan: "The political tasks stipulated in the plan for a certain period also determine the economic tasks of that period, and the characteristic of socialist planning policy is the unity of political and economic tasks," "The economic and political tasks in the plan also determine the priority of certain important aspects in a certain period. Lenin and Stalin's principle of important links is the main principle of socialist planning policy." It also says: "In order to achieve... a plan, the primary task is to find out its main links, because only by finding out and mastering this link can all other links in the plan be grasped." After clarifying the key issues, it then goes on to talk about the key points from the electrification plan to the post-war New Five-Year Plan. Secondly, it explains the national economic balance sheet, and here it provides a detailed explanation of the important significance of the balance sheet, the types of balance sheets, and the points that should be paid attention to when formulating the balance sheet. Secondly, it explains the classification of industries and the distribution of economic regions, as well as the unity of division of labor within departments and regions, and analyzes the various factors contained in the technical and economic indicators and the importance of technical and economic indicators for planning. Finally, it explains in detail the planning organization and the stages and methods of drafting the national economic plan. Fourth chapter: "The Struggle to Complete the National Economic Plan," which first explains the importance, tasks and functions of checking the plan, then the economic levers for completing the plan, such as currency circulation, price system and cost accounting, and finally the working people who are struggling to realize the plan—mainly socialist competition.

　　The second book—《How the Soviet Union Formulates Industrial Production Plans》, was published by the Publishing Bureau of the Soviet State Planning Committee in 1948. It introduces the scientific experience and research of the Soviet Union's planning problems, and it is a book worthy of our special attention and study. This book is divided into five chapters. The first chapter, "Organization of Soviet Industry," respectively explains the various departments of industry, various types of cooperative industry, introduces the existing organizations of various industrial ministries and their management, as well as the functions of the various departments and sections under the various ministries and management bureaus; describes a series of problems and tasks shared in the management of enterprises; introduces the various departments and their functions in the management of factories and the powers of the foremen; and describes the principles of economic accounting. The second chapter, "The Planning of Soviet Industrialization," analyzes the basic principles of national economic planning, the several stages of work in formulating national plans, and the planning of industrial production speed. The third chapter, "How to Establish an Industrial Production Plan," clarifies how to determine the needs of the state-owned national economy, the calculation of production capacity, the determination of the necessary amount of raw materials and fuel, the determination of the labor force needs, and how to determine the production volume plan. The fourth chapter, "Various Indicators of Industrial Production Plan," analyzes the production volume indicators, technical and economic indicators, and quality indicators of the state industrial production plan. The fifth chapter, "Supervision and Inspection of the Progress of Industrial Production Plan Execution," analyzes the purpose of checking the execution of the plan and the most important principles in the work of checking the progress of the production plan execution.

　　At the end of this book, there is an "Appendix" entitled "Problems of Socialist Industrial Planning," written by Akurnaev. This article criticizes the shortcomings of A. Yoffe's book. This book does have some shortcomings pointed out by Kurnaev, but it is still a good book. Kurnaev said at the end of his article: "The publishing house should entrust experienced workers in the field of national economic planning to write a very valuable work that the Soviet masses are eagerly awaiting." This shows that the Soviet Union currently lacks a more perfect book than this one. Before a more perfect book is published, this book is still worth studying especially by our comrades in financial and economic work. But when we study this book, we must always refer to Kurnaev's article.

　　The third book—《How to Make a Plan》 compiled several reports from Northeast enterprises on formulating plans, but also included several articles by Soviet authors. The first article is Mcgenberg's "On Economic Planning," which mainly talks about how leaders who implement the plan must be able to successfully and happily complete their tasks. Here, the "guerrilla tactics," "bureaucracy," "pure statism," "bureaucracy," "adventurism," "tailism," and "fantasy and conservatism" in the implementation of the plan are criticized one by one. At the same time, it points out the correct direction and method of not making mistakes, making fewer mistakes, and not failing, such as: to specifically understand the actual situation of the national economy, to be able to discover the actual needs of various departments of the national economy and the possibilities they possess but have not yet been utilized in a timely manner, it is necessary to ensure the correct interrelationship and organic connection between the development of various economic regions and various departments of material production, and to prevent the occurrence of unbalanced phenomena in various departments of the national economy, it is necessary to closely link the formulation of the plan and the struggle to realize this plan, the formulation of the plan should start from determining the main links, and attention should be paid to the correct interrelationship between the vanguard team and the masses. Finally, the significance, importance, and precautions for formulating various balance sheets, and the importance, characteristics, tasks, and methods of inspection work are explained in detail.

　　In several reports and summaries in the Northeast, we are introduced to how to learn from the Soviet Union and how to make a plan well, especially the report by Comrade Lü Dong, Minister of Industry, at the "Meeting on Reviewing the Production and Construction Plan for 1950" and the "Report on Specific Issues of Making a Plan," which are worth carefully reading. In the first report, the methods of making various balance sheets (such as price balance sheets, financial balance sheets, and employee balance sheets, etc.), the methods of reviewing production plans (such as determining variety plans, reviewing quotas, calculating labor efficiency wages and increasing the number of employees, reviewing costs, capital plans, financial plans, and transportation plans, etc.), and the methods of reviewing basic construction (such as project review, building construction project review, quota, cost, and investment review, etc.) are explained in detail. The second report specifically and concretely explains the basis for formulating the 1950 plan, the content and requirements of the production plan, and the basic construction plan. This report is a summary of two mobilizations to make a plan and two days of discussions by the Ministry of Industry. It correctly points out several specific problems that must be solved in making a plan, which is also a particularly noteworthy article.

　　The last two articles introduce the Soviet experience in making plans. The first article is Fedoseev's "Socialist Planning of the Soviet National Economy," which explains the significance of the plan, the procedure for compiling, reviewing, and approving the plan, and the steps for compiling the plan. The second article is Fedoseev's "Production Plan of Soviet Industrial Enterprises," which provides a detailed and clear introduction to the production plan, labor plan, calculation of the wage fund, material technical supply plan, product cost plan, and enterprise financial plan.

　　Finally, let me repeat one sentence, the above three books are all good books that comrades engaged in financial and economic work must read.

专栏：

　　介绍一批苏联经济建设书籍（上）
    刘及辰
    目前关于苏联经济建设的书籍，出版的还不够多，我读过的更是有限。兹仅就我所读过那有限的几本，分别地介绍一下，借供读者选择上的便利。在介绍以前，我还要说明两点：第一，在所介绍的一些书中，不光是推荐好书，也附带批评有缺点的书。第二，我是按着书的性质分别介绍的，第一是关于苏联经济制度和经济方法的，第二是关于苏联计划经济和经济计划的，第三是关于苏联经济核算制的，第四是关于苏联企业领导方法的，第五是关于苏联集体农场的，第六是关于财政、银行及货币的。现在就让我依次介绍于下：
  一  关于苏联经济制度和经济方法的
    苏联经济建设的伟大成就，是由几个斯大林五年计划铸成的；而计划经济的实行必须依靠着经济方法，而经济方法又是和社会主义经济制度下的价值法则分不开的。所以在我们学习苏联经济建设时，对于它的经济制度和价值法则先求一个了解，也是必要的。现在就先让我介绍几本关于这类的小册子吧。
    《论苏联经济制度》陈山李征合编  旅大中苏友好协会出版
    《苏联工业化的方法》列昂节夫著  新华书店印行
    这两本书的共同点，是在它们都对于苏联社会主义制度下的价值法则和资本主义制度下的价值法则做了一个对比的分析，并阐明了前者的优越性。自苏联推翻了资本主义私有经济制度而建立了生产手段和生产资料公有的社会主义经济制度以后，一切的经济法则在这个经济制度上就都起了一个本质的变化，即把资本主义的社会生产力大量浪费的价值法则，一变而为计划经济的工具；把资本主义不合理的分配原则一变而为社会主义按劳取酬的原则；把资本主义在周期危机中行的扩大再生产的法则，一变而为经济生产关系完全适应生产力性质的法则，即变为没有经济危机和生产力不断上涨的扩大再生产的法则。同时，这些书也指明了，这些个变化决不是凭空臆造出来的，而是苏联社会主义经济制度本身固有的一种规律。另外，第一本书还介绍了苏联社会主义的生产方法，诸如减低产品成本费用、社会主义竞赛运动、集体合同以及后备劳动力的培养等等。第二本书根据列宁、斯大林的学说，分析了苏联工业化的方法。它说明了苏联工业化方法的优越性，特别对于苏联直接由重工业的开始和社会主义工业资金的来源这两个问题，说明的较多。
    另外，还有值得我们一读的一本小册子，即：
    《苏联经济上社会主义改造的作用》孔柯嘉译作家书屋发行
    本书说明了，布尔什维克及苏联政府的政策在苏联经济建设上所发挥的伟大的组织和推动的力量，假使没有它们，苏联的经济建设的成功是不能想像的。其次，说明了苏联人民把国民经济计划当成国家的法律，他们都把执行和完成经济计划的任务和遵守劳动纪律做为自己的义务。
  二  关于苏联计划经济和经济计划的
    《苏联的社会主义工业化》卡希莫甫斯基著  新华书店印行
    本书首先介绍了三十年前沙俄时代工业落后的情况，分析了苏联全国电气化计划的制订和其重大意义，工业化的途径，发展重工业的主要环节，以及资金的来源等等。其次，它叙述了工业化的基本路标——第一次五年计划、第二次五年计划、第三次五年计划；接着就分析了第二次世界大战以前苏联所蕴藏的和战争期间所发挥的惊人的力量。最后，分析了战后新五年计划的发展、成就和未来无穷的展望。本书明白而正确地叙述和阐明了苏联几个五年计划发展过程的全貌。
    还有一本名叫《苏联是强大的工业国》（罗森克著、新华书店发行），内容和上书大致相同。不过这本书是在苏联卫国战争期中出版的，故不如前书完备；并且，有的用语（例如五四页）因为时过境迁，已不适合于目前情况了。
    又有一本书，叫做《苏联工业化之路》（劳凯声著、张新华译）。本书内容和上面两本书相同，但它综合了上述两书的长处，是比较完整的一本好书。另有一本同性质的书，名为《苏联工业史纲》（布洛维尔著、克昂译，以上二书均由天下图书公司印行），内容也还好，只是材料都是限于一九三七年以前的。
    此外还有一本郑宏述著的《苏联计划经济》（上海杂志公司刊行）。这本书写的简明通俗，观点也还正确，但缺点不少。如在第一章第二节《计划的特性》上，只指出了“指导性——学术性——综合性——政治性——实践性”这几点，而对于相当重要的几点如规律性和民主性都没有谈到；第四章《苏联计划经济之史的发展》内，对于列宁所提出并决定了的苏联全国电气化计划及其重大意义，未加说明；在叙述苏联三个五年计划中，很少讲到苏联工人工资的增加和其文化生活的提高；又在讲苏联卫国战争时，没有把计划经济和工人群众所发挥的热烈而伟大的力量，适当地表现出来。
    上面介绍的都是一般读物。以下我们再介绍一些比较专门一点的书：
    《联共党关于经济建设问题的决议》（上）新华书店印行
    《苏联新五年计划》东北书店印行
    前一本书是讲新经济政策时期经济建设的，后一本书是介绍战后新五年计划的。这两本书的译文都不算好，但还有参考的价值。前一本书是由《联共党历次会议决议》一书摘译其中关于国民经济恢复时期（一九二一——一九二五年）经济建设问题的决议而成的。本书指出了：苏联在这个新经济政策时期，首要的是在建设性的恢复，故当时的任务，首先必须发展农业，打破城乡隔阂，以奠定工业化的基础。本书又指出了：计划经济工作不是孤立的，处处要照顾到各方面的联系，否则，便将失之毫厘，差以千里，影响到整个的计划工作。这些都是值得我们借镜的。本书关于苏联的合作事业介绍的颇多，全书共计一七八页，专讲苏联合作社者就占了三十二页之多，另外散见各处的亦复不少，因此希望从事合作工作的同志们一读。
    苏联自新经济政策实行以后，又经过了三个五年计划的经济建设，已开始向着共产主义大道迈进，但在卫国战争中却使这一个迈进受了很大的影响。苏联自卫国战争胜利结束后，马上就把战时经济加以改造，重新走上和平经济建设，并踏上通往共产主义的大道。这时期提出来的新任务，就是要在一九四六——一九五○年这五年期间复兴国内被蹂躏的各区域，恢复工农业的战前水平，然后再大规模地超过这个水平。例如在新五年计划中规定说：“苏联国民经济复兴与发展的五年计划最后一年，苏联全部工业生产额……要比战前一九四○年增长百分之四十八”，“全部农业生产品之发展，至五年期末，与一九四○年比较，增加百分之二十七”，关于提高人民生活的物质与文化水平的计划，规定“在五年计划期内，在增加生产发展商品贸易与劳动者住宅及文化生活服务费用提高的基础上，不仅恢复人民福利的战前水准，而且将国民收入的战前水准提高百分之十以上”。上述第二本书，主要是介绍该新五年计划法规的，它是研究苏联战后新五年计划的很好的材料，凡学习苏联经济建设经验的同志们都应一读此书。
    那末，苏联是怎样制订它的经济计划的呢？这是我们在学习苏联经济建设经验时的一个非常重要的问题。现在就来进一步地介绍几本关于这一类的书籍：
    《苏联国民经济的设计》  华尔斯基著  天马译时代出版社发行
    《苏联如何制订工业生产计划》  亚·约非著东北新华书店印行
    《怎样做计划》  东北新华书店编印
    上面列举的三本书，都是我们学习苏联经济建设不可不读的好书。第一本书共分四章，第一章是“苏联计划国民经济的作用和任务”，这章首先说明了社会主义计划的先决条件：“社会主义计划经济的政治的与经济的先决条件，就是劳动阶级掌握政权，废除资本主义的私有财产和建立生产工具的公有制”。但是“计划经济，并非在十月社会主义革命之后一蹴而几，它是在反抗苏维埃国家和社会主义制度的内外敌人的勇猛斗争中生长和发展起来的，并且还得克服横在道路上的大困难”。“现在，作为社会主义祖国经济发展上的一个巨大的组织力量的社会主义计划，已经渗入千百万苏维埃人民的生活与习惯中”。又说：“计划经济的目的就是要消灭失业”，这是资本主义国家所做不到的。二次世界大战以后，资本主义国家的市场极度减缩，生产降低，失业工人日益增多，这些国家与早已消灭了失业问题的苏联当然不能比拟，就是与新民主主义的国家，也不能相比。因为新民主主义国家已有了计划的条件，“新民主主义各国的计划，却在坚固的政治和经济独立的基础上，依照各该国人民的利益，顺利地解决了他们战后复员和发展的各项问题”，“虽然他们的计划经济在发展水准上和其他特点上，与苏联的社会主义计划尚有不同。劳动人民之掌握政权，大规模工业和银行之国有，以及土改之实施，已经使这些新民主主义国家能依照人民大众的利益，以最高的速度，计划国民经济的复员，消灭经济和技术上的落后性以及保证各该国的独立”。这是正确地说明了我们新民主主义国家的计划条件，说明了我们新民主主义国家比资本主义国家的优越性。其次，在讲计划是苏联经济发展的规律时说：“根据社会经济发展规律的知识，苏维埃国家应用计划给予这些规律以预期的效果”，“社会主义的国民经济计划是基于社会发展的高深科学的先见，而这次先见则根据于社会主义经济规律的知识。”又说：“社会主义计划的主要推动力就是布尔什维克党，它武装着马克思主义和列宁主义的理论，并且在社会方面和政府方面都是劳动人民组织的指导核心。”最后，对于社会主义计划的基本任务说：“社会主义计划的基本任务，亦即苏维埃经济存在与发展的基本条件，就是加强我国经济对资本主义世界的自主和独立。”第二章为《苏联国民经济计划的发展》，按照历史的发展分别地介绍了社会主义计划的最初几年的情况，电气计划，复员时期的计划，三个五年计划，卫国战争时期的计划，以及战后新的五年计划。第三章为《制定国民经济计划的原则》，首先说明的是国民经济计划的经济与政治任务与主要的环节：“计划中的为某一时期所规定的政治任务，也决定了该一时期的经济任务，社会主义计划政策的特质，是政治与经济任务的统一”，“计划中的经济与政治任务，也决定某一时期某些重要的优先性，列宁、斯大林的重要环节的原则，是社会主义计划政策的主要原则”。又说：“为了要实现……一个计划，首要之务就是找出它的主要环节，因为只有找出与掌握这个环节之后，计划中所有其他的一切环节，才能把握。”在阐明了重点问题以后，接着就从电化计划的重点，一直说到战后新的五年计划的重点。其次说明计划与国家经济的对照表，这里对于对照表的重要意义、对照表的种类、及制订对照表时所应注意的各点，都做了详细的说明。又其次，说明了工业的分类和经济区域的分布以及各部门内和各区域内分工的统一性，又分析了技术经济指数所含的各种因素和技术经济指标对于计划的重要性。最后，详细地说明了计划机构及草拟国民经济计划的阶段与方法。第四章：《为完成国民经济计划的斗争》，这里首先说明的为检查计划的重要性、任务及功用，其次为计划完成的经济杠杆，如货币流通、价格制度及成本会计等等，最后是为实现计划而斗争的劳动人民群众——主要为社会主义的竞赛。
    第二本书——《苏联如何制订工业生产计划》，是苏联国家计划委员会出版局于一九四八年出版的。它介绍了苏联计划化问题的科学经验和研究，是值得我们特别注意学习的一本书。本书共计五章，第一章《苏联工业的组织》，分别说明了工业的各部门、各种不同的合作工业，介绍了工业各部及其管理的现有机构，以及各部各管理局下面的各处科的机能；叙述了企业管理方面所分担的一系列的问题和任务；介绍了工厂管理方面的各科及其机能以及工长的职权；又叙述了经济核算制的原则。第二章《苏联工业化的计划化》，分析了国民经济计划化的基本原则，制订国家计划的几个工作阶段，以及工业生产速度的计划化等问题。第三章《怎样建立工业生产计划》，这里所阐明的，是如何确定国定国民经济的需要，生产能力的计算，原材料和燃料的必要数量的确定，劳动力的需要的确定，以及怎样确定生产量计划等问题。第四章《工业生产计划的各种指标》，分析了国家工业生产计划的生产量指标，技术经济指标和质量指标。第五章《工业生产计划执行进程的监督与检查》，分析了检查计划执行情况的目的所在的各点，及检查生产计划执行进程工作上的最重要的原则等问题。
    本书最后有一个“附录”，题为《社会主义工业计划化问题》，系阿库尔那也夫所作。这篇文章是批评亚·约非这本书中缺点的。本书诚然存在着库尔那也夫所指摘出来的一些缺点，然而它还不失为一本好书。库尔那也夫在他那篇文章的结尾里说：“出版局应该委嘱国民经济计划工作方面造诣精深的工作者，来编著一本苏维埃群众引颈期待的非常有价值的著作。”由此可见目前苏联还缺少比这本书更完美的书出版。在没有更完美的书出版以前，这本书还是值得我们财经工作同志们特别精研的。但在我们研读本书时，必须随时参看库尔那也夫的文章。
    第三本书——《怎样做计划》编集了东北企业制订计划的几篇报告但也编入了苏联作者的几篇文章。第一篇是麦真贝尔格的《论经济计划》，主要是讲执行计划领导工作者必要如何才能胜利愉快地完成自己的任务问题。这里对于执行计划工作中的“游击作风”、“文牍主义”、“纯统计主义”、“官僚主义”、“冒险主义”、“尾巴主义”、以及“空想和保守主义”等等，都逐一地加以批判。同时并指出不犯错误少犯错误不失败的正确方向和方法，诸如：要具体了解国民经济的实际情况，要能够及时地发现国民经济各部门的实际需要和它们所拥有的但尚未加以利用的可能性，必须保证各经济地区和物质生产各部门的发展之正确的相互关系及有机的联系，并预防国民经济各部门中不均衡现象的发生，要在编制计划和为实现这一计划而斗争之间做着密切联系，计划的编制要从确定各主导环节作起，要注意先锋队和群众间的正确的相互关系等等。末了，对于制订各种对照表的意义、重要性和应注意的事项，对于检查工作的重要性、特点、任务和方法等等，也都做了详细的阐明。
    在东北的几篇报告和总结中，介绍给我们如何学习苏联搞好了计划，指出了如何才能做好计划，其中特别是工业部部长吕东同志的《关于审核一九五○年生产修建计划会议上的报告》和《关于做计划具体问题的报告》，是值得我们细心精读的。在第一个报告中，把各种平衡表（如物价平衡表、财务平衡表及职工平衡表等）的制法，审核生产计划（如确定品种计划、审核定额、算出劳动效率工资和增加职工人数、审查成本、资金计划、财务计划及运输计划等）的方法，和审查基本建设（如工程审查、房屋建筑工程审查、定额、成本和投资审查等）的方法，都做了详细的说明。第二个报告，分别地具体地说明了制订一九五○年计划的根据，生产计划的内容及要求，和基本建设计划这三个问题。这个报告，是经过了两次动员做计划以后又经过了工业部两天讨论的一个总结。它正确地指出了在做计划中必须解决的若干具体问题，这也是特别值得注意的一篇。
    最后两篇是介绍苏联做计划的经验的，第一篇是费多雪夫的“苏联国民经济的社会主义计划性”，这里说明了计划的意义，编制审查和批准计划的程序，以及编制计划的步骤。第二篇为费多雪夫的“苏联工业企业的生产计划”，其中对于生产计划，劳动计划，工资基金的核算，材料技术供给计划，产品成本的计划，以及企业的财政计划等等，均做了详细而明确的介绍。
    末了，让我再重复一句，上述的三本书都是从事财经工作同志们不可不读的好书。
