　　Who Causes Poverty and Disaster?
　　——A Record of Rural Areas by Dongting Lake Under the Feudal Land System
　　Our Correspondents Li Wen, Fang Di
　　I. How Barren洲Became Fertile Land
　　The eleven counties in Hunan bordering Dongting Lake—Changde, Yiyang, Yuanjiang, Xiangyin, Hanshou, Nanxian, Fengxian, Huarong, Anxiang, Linxiang, and Yueyang—have a total of more than 5.6 million mu of polder fields, most of which are fertile fields capable of producing two crops of rice a year. The people of Hunan call this place the "Granary," but this "Granary" was originally an uninhabited barren洲, overgrown with reeds and thatch.
　　The barren洲has been gradually silting up in Dongting Lake for more than a hundred years. Especially in the last three or four decades, the siltation in the center of the lake has increased even more, and the area of洲soil has widened accordingly. In recent years, the silting land around Dongting Lake has become a bloody arena for the Kuomintang bureaucrats, party thugs, and local squires and bullies to compete for. Thirty years ago, the Kuomintang reactionary government established the "Lake Field Bureau" in Hunan, and later changed its name to "Lake Field Clearing Office" to indulge in sucking the blood and sweat of the working people. Land grabbers paid a sum to the "Bureau" and "Office," and obtained a "license" (i.e., a license to seize land), and obtained the right to openly seize land. Even more, some bullies, squires, and gang leaders did not need to obtain a "license" from the reactionary government. When they saw that a certain洲soil was about to emerge, they took thugs on a boat around a circle, inserted markers around it, and this piece of silting land was considered to belong to him. When this piece of洲soil emerged from the water, no one could move a grain of soil. The largest became "洲Soil Kings," and they all owned more than 10,000 to tens of thousands of mu of land.
　　After the barren洲was demarcated, the landlords formed a dike bureau, recruited thousands of workers and peasants, and began to build dikes, reclaim wasteland, and repair polders.
　　Peasants came here from all over to reclaim wasteland. First, they paid the landlord five or six dou to one shi of "entering the village" (deposit) per mu of barren洲and wrote a tenancy agreement. Then they built a thatched shed to settle down and began to chop down the reeds and thatch on the洲one by one, rising before dawn and sleeping after midnight to drain the water from the洲and create arable land. The "deposit" increased every year. In the second and third years, when the barren洲became fertile land, it also changed from one shi to two, three, or even four shi.
　　"Landlords don't spend money to repair polders." "Repair the skin in the first year, half in the second year, leave a tail in the third year, and make it up in the fourth year"—this is a vivid description of the landlord's building and repairing dikes and polders by an elementary school teacher who has been teaching in the polders for many years, and also points out the reason for "not spending money." For example, a barren洲of about 4,000 mu can collect 2,400 shi of grain deposits in the first year, but the dike is only "repaired the skin," and more than half of the grain is used for usury. By the second year, they again used the excuse that the dike was not completed to ask the tenants to increase the deposit. After three years, the principal plus interest, interest rolls interest, and the increase of the deposit has new interest. The interest alone is not enough to repair the polder dike. On the other hand, the time for repairing the dike is prolonged, and it is easier to delay and deduct the wages of the workers. Many workers did not get paid for repairing the dike for two years and could only get a few "work tickets" that could not be exchanged for money. When the spring famine was severe in the second year, the workers had to sell the work tickets to the dike bureau at a low price of 30% or 50%. Luo Chuntang, an old dike repair worker in Xiangyin, remembers this account very clearly. He said, "In the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917), I repaired the dike in Hefeng Polder. The dike bureau agreed to two dou of rice per cubic foot of soil (440 dan), but it was not until the second year that I was given a few work tickets, and the work ticket for each cubic foot of soil was just enough to buy two sheng of rice." In the polder where Luo Chuntang worked, dozens of workers were so hungry that they asked the dike bureau for wages. The landlords brought soldiers with guns from the county and carried out a massacre. Four workers were killed, more than a dozen were injured, and more than a dozen were charged with the crime of "bandit" and imprisoned.
　　This is the history of the growth of each polder on the lake shore; the barren洲is how it became fertile land. Are these fertile fields the landlords'? No! The landlords robbed them from the working people by means that were even more despicable than robbers.
　　II. After the Landlords Plundered the Land
　　Here, land is concentrated to an alarming degree. According to a survey of seven villages in Xiangyin, Hanshou, and Yuanjiang counties, the landlords, who account for only 3% of the population, occupy 61% of the total land. This only represents the general area. More prominent is that the landlords, who account for 1.8% of the population in Xiangyin County, occupy 71% of the total land; in some areas, almost all the land is occupied by landlords. For example, in Kangning Polder, Xiongan District, landlords occupy more than 90% of the land in the entire polder.
　　All the evil exploitation arises from this foundation. When the peasants talked about their exploitation, they said sadly, "There is no land to cultivate, what else can we do if we don't let them (the landlords) manipulate us?" Yes, the landlords use the peasants' "no land to cultivate" to exploit them in various ways, such as deposits, land rent, and usury. These methods of exploitation are combined with each other, like an iron chain tightly binding the peasants.
　　The land rent is generally 1.5 to 2 shi per mu, which is nominally about 40% to 50% of the normal annual yield per mu (3 to 4 shi), but in fact it is as high as 60% or 70%. Because the landlords collect rent according to "毛mu" (hairy mu), "毛mu" includes the foundations of houses, roadbeds, cow sheds, etc., which cannot be cultivated, as well as the imaginary numbers written by the landlords when renting out and writing tenancy agreements, which are less than the actual numbers. Usually, the actual cultivated land only accounts for two-thirds of the "毛mu", or even less, which greatly increases the rent.
　　When peasants rent land, they must first pay a "deposit," which is mostly three shi per mu, which is a barbaric extra exploitation. When landlords calculate "deposits," they often "adapt to the times" to convert grain into money, or convert money into grain, and the price is determined by the landlord. Peasants often become indebted for life or go bankrupt because of this.
　　The tenants of Li Bingyan, a landlord in Puqing Polder, Xiangyin, will never forget how Li Bingyan converted the deposit into grain to increase their exploitation. In 1945, the Kuomintang announced a ban on the use of silver dollars. Li Bingyan insisted on converting the 140 silver dollars that Yin Chunsheng paid when he started renting land into 14 shi of grain (the market price was only 3 yuan per shi at that time), and then said that the deposit was "too little" and asked Chunsheng to take out another 11 shi of grain. Wang Xilin, a self-cultivating farmer, went bankrupt in this way: In 1932, he borrowed 25 shi of grain from Li Bingyan. In the second year, he could not repay it, so Li Bingyan added interest to the interest and took away all the 12.7 mu of land (including 3 mu of ancestral graves) to pay off the debt. Wang Xilin still cultivated the land and forced him to take out a deposit of 30 shi of grain, and then he owed a new debt. In less than a few years, all the trees, furniture, houses, etc. in Wang Xilin's family became Li Bingyan's property.
　　Li Bingyan's exploitation facts and skills are not prominent in the rural areas by the lake. In the words of the local peasants, he is only a "small role" with three to five hundred mu. Of course, he cannot be compared with the "洲Soil Kings," even compared with another "small role" Cai Cexun, he is inferior.
　　Cai Cexun is a landlord in the fifth village of the second district of Yuanjiang. In early July, when we passed through Yuanjiang to Xiangyin from Yiyang, we heard many peasants' painful accusations against him. Only one thing is mentioned here:
　　In 1944, when the Japanese invaders invaded Yuanjiang, the situation was very tense. Cai Cexun handed over the housework, including more than ten mu of orange orchards and a piece of wasteland, to his hired worker Xiang Juqiu for management, and fled to his relatives' home in a hurry. Before leaving, he said to the hired worker that he would divide the products of the orange orchard equally when he came back. The following year, Cai Cexun came back. Thanks to the hard work of Xiang Juqiu's family, the orange orchard had been cultivated very prosperously and was full of large honey oranges, and it would be harvested in another month. Cai Cexun's eyes turned red when he saw the wealth. He had a wicked plan, insisting that Xiang Juqiu had stolen and sold his furniture, and sent Xiang Juqiu to the township office to go to jail. The neighbors sympathized with Xiang Juqiu and bailed him out. Cai used even more vicious means. One night, he sent soldiers with guns to force Xiang Juqiu to leave the village. If he didn't leave, he would be dragged out and killed. A hope of harvest turned into tears: Xiang Juqiu not only did not get the honey oranges, but also lost a year's salary. Late at night, he took his wife and children, looking back every step of the way, left the orange orchard that was about to be harvested, called to the sky, and fled to another village. In this way, Cai Cexun completely swallowed more than 300 dan of honey oranges, more than 100 shi of sweet potatoes, and a part of cotton.
　　As for those "洲Soil Kings," such as Tang Dongsheng in Nanxian, Chen Xishan in Xiangyin, Wang Yihua in Yuanjiang, and Gao Yaolin in Hanshou, in the large areas they ruled—they occupied most or part of the land in a dozen to dozens of polders, stretching for dozens of miles, the peasants were their slaves, allowing them to plunder and kill. For example, in 1923, Gao Yaolin led more than 200 thugs to armed robbery of the peasants' rapeseed in Quangu Polder, and filled four "big gang boats." Wang Yihua often forced tenants to pay rent early when there was a shortage of food, and those who could not pay would be recorded in the account, and they would be repaid with an interest of 5 dou per shi of grain in the autumn. When collecting rent early in 1937, a tenant surnamed Cao in Dong Polder was forced into desperation and injured two gunners who were urging rent. The next day, Wang Yihua immediately notified the township office to send two more machine guns and twelve gunners, arrested Cao, said he was a "thug," and shot him immediately. The tenants were afraid of Wang Yihua's power and had to swallow their anger and let him do what he wanted.
　　Thus, in this lake area known as the "Granary," a scene of sin and misery appeared: On the one hand, the "洲Soil Kings" lived in licentious enjoyment. Chen Xishan in Xiangyin filled the tall "Wan Shi Granary" with rice exchanged for the blood and sweat of the peasants and built a beautiful Western-style house in Changsha; Wang Yihua in Yuanjiang gathered people to gamble wildly all night, winning or losing hundreds of mu at every turn, squandering wine, meat, and mountains, and even the two foreign dogs he kept ate a pound of meat every day; When Tang Dongsheng in Nanxian married off his daughter, he ate "American aid" rice at every meal, and ordered a gold box toothbrush for his son-in-law with more than 30 shi of grain—this is more than two years of life for a peasant! On the other hand, what about the peasants? They worked hard on the land all year round but could not get enough to eat, and they constantly ate broken rice and weeds all year round. A folk song describing the lives of peasants is popular on the lake shore: "It's 'good to make money' on the lake shore, one goes for two or three years; if you want to go home to see your mother, you 'don't have' money to cross the river." It profoundly reflects the hopes of the peasants before they came to the lake shore and the infinite bitterness after suffering cruel exploitation and extreme poverty.
　　III. "Forcibly Occupying Mountains and Dominating Water"
　　When the peasants could not pay the rent, their deposits were deducted, their family property was exhausted, and they could not cultivate the land, they could only rely on their hands to chop firewood in the firewood mountains (undeveloped barren洲) or go fishing in the lake to make a living. According to a survey, there are more than 10,000 woodcutters in Xiongan District, Xiangyin; last year, there were 30,000 to 40,000 people who went to Dongting East Lake to chop firewood. What about the fishermen? There are more than 1,100 households in the third district of Yiyang; more than 3,000 households in Yuanjiang County, and 8,000 households in Xiongan District, Xiangyin. The number of woodcutters and fishermen in the eleven counties of Dongting Lake is very large.
　　They still cannot escape the cruel feudal exploitation. This is a world of "forcibly occupying mountains and dominating water." Every lake and every mountain has been plundered by the violent for their own use. Pi Dongqing, a bully landlord in Yuanjiang, once forcibly occupied the large and small fish lakes from Yuanjiang to Yueyang. Gao Yaolin, a "洲Soil King" in Hanshou, occupied five or six firewood mountains such as Xinyang洲.
　　The firewood that the woodcutters get after a day's hard work, the firewood mountain boss (landlord) insists on deducting 20% to 40%, and the labor and transportation costs must be paid by the woodcutters themselves. Some bosses do not want firewood, but collect firewood tax according to the sickle. No matter how much you cut, you have to pay about 4 shi of grain per sickle every year (only in June and July can you cut firewood). In Piaowei, a landlord surnamed Wang came to collect once; the pseudo-Yueyang County government came to collect once; the Kuomintang military officer corps also came to collect once. Eight shi of grain were collected for each sickle. The woodcutters did not dare not give to anyone. Sometimes, when the two sides argued over the firewood tax and fought, the woodcutters were the ones who suffered.
　　Fishermen must pay "fishing tax" when fishing in the lake, which generally accounts for 40% to 60% of the fishing volume. The "洲Soil King" even purchased steamships and wooden boats dedicated to patrolling the lake and collecting taxes, and patrolled the fish lakes in a majestic manner. The year before last, the fisherman Yu Changsheng (first district of Yuanjiang) was about to celebrate the New Year, but he did not have a grain of rice. He took a boat to Riluotan Lake at night, hoping to catch some fish to exchange for rice for the New Year. Unfortunately, he was caught by the patrol, and the fishing net was torn to pieces on the spot, and the fish was confiscated; the lake owner also ordered the Baozhang to fine him five silver dollars. He could not afford it, and watched helplessly as the lake owner划走了the fishing boat, the lifeline of his family.
　　In addition, the fishermen also suffered from the Kuomintang's "monthly donation," "fishery union membership fee," and other taxes, as well as the intermediate exploitation of usury and commissions from fish merchants.
　　Many peasants said, "If you want to talk about hardship, we are not as good as them (woodcutters and fishermen)."
　　IV. Man-Made Disasters Bring Natural Disasters
　　Accompanying the cruel feudal exploitation is one flood after another. Some polders collapsed for three years in seven years, and some were flooded twice in one year. Taking 1949 (when it was not yet liberated) as an example, a total of 441 polder dikes collapsed in the eleven counties by the lake, submerging 1,742,000 mu of polder fields, and another 2,533,000 mu of polder fields were flooded, although the polder dikes did not collapse. The rural economy suffered severe damage, with a reduction of more than 14.9 million shi of rice, causing more than 1.2 million disaster victims to be displaced and plunged into extreme distress.
　　The rushing water ran away the peasants' thatched houses, livestock, and farm tools, swallowed the rice that was about to be harvested, and many people were deprived of their lives. This is a natural disaster; however, this natural disaster is brought about by man-made disasters. Having personally experienced two different worlds, the peasants by the lake, who have been liberated for a year, see it more clearly. In April this year, the repair project of Xinsheng Da Polder in Huarong was completed. More than 15,000 peasants from far and near came to congratulate and sent a vivid couplet: "For the past sixty years, feudal landlords have always collapsed the dikes they built; in one and a half months, liberated peasants have repaired the polders and succeeded in one fell swoop." Why did the feudal landlords always collapse the dikes they built? In our visit, we have heard the peasants say this more than once: This year, the polder dike is built firmly. If there is no unexpected flood, it can be guaranteed to be safe. In previous years, the funds for repairing the dike were more than this year. The most used on the dike did not exceed 40%, and the rest was stuffed into the pockets of the dike bureau members, or used to pay for hotels, prostitution, and big meals under the name of "administrative expenses." If the dike funds, fishing taxes, and "dike loans" taken out by the peasants are really used for dike construction, the polder dike can be prevented from collapsing.
　　Each polder by the lake has a dike bureau, which was controlled by landlords and gentry before liberation. The landlords in power often transferred all or most of the dike repair fees, which were nominally paid equally by the tenants, to the tenants and small farmers through various methods of false reporting and misappropriation.
　　The dike bureau members did not take flood control and disaster prevention to heart, but regarded the dike bureau as an agency for corruption and self-enrichment and squandering. Take flood fighting as an example. The funds for purchasing flood control equipment were reimbursed as "administrative expenses"—including hotel fees, entertainment fees, travel expenses... When a flood came, they frantically sent soldiers to tear down the peasants' houses, collect broken quilts and rotten mats, and drive the peasants to fight the flood. The committee members could then take the opportunity to make a "flood fighting fortune" by borrowing the excuse of "compensating the peasants for their losses." The "administrative expenses" of the dike bureaus in each polder usually account for more than 60% of the total expenses. The accounts of the Taihe Polder Dike Bureau in Hanshou County for half a year show that there are more than a dozen items of various administrative expenses, and the paper fee alone is 18 shi of rice, and the tobacco fee is 7 shi of rice. When Zhou Chenglin, a landlord in Qilihu, Feng County, was the director of the dike, he used the dike repair loan to do a business. He calculated the loan at two silver dollars and one corner and one shi of grain and received a "loan" of 300 shi of grain, but only spent one yuan and eight corners per shi to buy 300 shi of grain. When the grain price rose to four yuan, he sold the grain again and used the money to lend it out once at "dismantling interest" (a short-term usury). As a result, Zhou Chenglin's land increased from 200 mu to 700 mu. This is a very common fact on the lake shore.
　　Let's look at the facts when the polder dike collapsed: In Yu Jia Polder, Eleventh District, Xiangyin County, the landlord Yi Jingshan was the director of the dike. In addition to collecting three dou of dike fee per mu, he also borrowed a "loan" of 700 shi of grain and 2.4 taels of gold from the puppet government. The money was embezzled by Hu Da, a member of the puppet provincial assembly, and Liu Aishan, a member of the county assembly. When the money reached the polder, it was "pre-paid" by Yi Jingshan and his gang. However, the dike was not repaired, and no flood control equipment was prepared. The peasants were anxious and went to ask Yi Jingshan. Yi Jingshan said, "Our soil is good, the more the waves beat, the tighter the soil." On the night of May 17, a strong wind and waves came, and the soil on the dike collapsed piece by piece. The peasants hurriedly looked for the dike bureau. Yi Jingshan slipped away at this critical moment of the wind and waves and watched helplessly as the dike collapsed. Subsequently, 13,000 mu of fertile land in three polders, including Ma Yan, Fuxing, and Linxin, were submerged. Hefeng Polder did not collapse last year. The water level was two or three feet lower than last year, and the polder dike could have been prevented from collapsing. When the water was tight, the director of the dike, Liao Zicheng (landlord), went to the outer polder to urge rent, leaving his lackey Liu Shiqing (dike foreman) in charge of the bureau. On June 20, a few peasants discovered that there was a leak in the dike near Liao Zicheng's field. They immediately rang the gong to save the dike, but Liu Shiqing tried his best to stop them (because, according to the old rules, whoever's field was blocked would have to pay for the flood fighting. He wanted to save some money for his master) and drove the peasants away with a pistol. Then he went to drink and play cards with some cronies. The leak was getting bigger and bigger, and the flood poured into Hefeng Polder. Liu Shiqing was still playing cards with his friends. In this way, more than 30,000 mu of rice that was about to be harvested and the property of more than 20,000 people were buried in the hands of this little hooligan.
　　It is a natural disaster, but also a man-made disaster. Is it not obvious who caused the poverty and disaster?

　　是谁造成贫困与灾难？
　　——记封建土地制度下的洞庭湖滨农村
    本报记者  力文  方堤
    一、荒洲怎样变成良田
    湖南滨洞庭湖十一县——常德、益阳、沅江、湘阴、汉寿、南县、沣县、华容、安乡、临湘、岳阳，共有垸田五百六十余万亩，绝大部分是能产两季稻子的良田。湖南人民把这块地方叫着“米仓”，但这“米仓”原来却是渺无人烟的荒洲，到处丛生着芦苇和茅柴。
    荒洲是一百多年来陆续在洞庭湖里淤积成的。特别是最近三四十年，湖心泥沙淤积得更多了，洲土面积便随着宽广起来。这些年来，洞庭湖周围的淤积地，成了国民党官僚、党棍及当地豪绅、恶霸争夺的血腥场所。国民党反动政府三十年前在湖南设“湖田局”，后来又改用“湖田清理处”等名目，来尽情的吸吮着劳动人民的血汗。土地兼并者向“局”、“处”纳一笔资，扯了“照”（即霸占土地的执照），就获得了公开强夺土地的权利。更有些恶霸豪绅和帮会头子，不用到反动政府扯“照”，当他们看到某块洲土将要淤现的时候，便带着打手乘划子兜上一圈，周围插上标记，这块淤积地便算是属于他了。当这块洲土出水的时候，任何人不能动一粒土。最大的成了“洲土大王”，他们都拥有一万亩至数万亩以上的土地。
    荒洲圈定以后，地主们组成堤务局，招来成千的工人和农民，开始筑堤开荒、修垸子。
    农民从各地来到这里开荒，每亩荒洲先向地主缴五六斗至一石的“进庄”（押金），写下佃约。然后搭个茅棚安身，开始一棵一棵地砍掉洲上的芦柴，起五更睡半夜的排除洲内的渍水，用劳动来创造可耕的土地。“押金”每年加重着，第二年、三年当荒洲变成良田时，它也由一石变成二石三石甚至四石。
    “地主修垸子是不花本钱的。”“头年修个皮，二年修半截，三年留个尾，四年才补齐”——这是一个在垸子里教书多年的小学教师，对地主筑修堤垸的生动描述，也指出了“不花本钱”的原因所在。举例来说吧：一个四千亩大小的荒洲，第一年可收两千四百石谷的押金，堤却只“修个皮”，用一半以上的谷去放高利贷；到第二年，又借口堤未修成要佃户再增押金，经过三年时间，本加利，利滚利、增加押金又有新利，单利息修这个垸堤就用不完。另一方面，修堤时间拖长了，工人的工资也就更便于拖欠、克扣，许多工人修了两年堤得不到工钱，只能得到几张兑不到钱的“工票”，等到第二年春荒严重的时候，工人们只好把工票以三成或五成的价格低价卖给堤务局。湘阴老修堤工人罗春堂对这笔账记得很清楚，他说：“民国六年（一九一七年）我在和丰垸修堤，堤务局讲好了每方土（四百四十担）二斗米，但直到第二年，才给了我几张工票，每方土的工票刚好买二升米。”在罗春堂作工的那个垸子，有几十个工人饿得不行，向堤务局要工钱，地主们就从县里搬来枪兵，进行了一次大屠杀，四个工人牺牲了，十几个受了伤，还有十几个被按上“匪”的罪名，押在牢里。
    这就是滨湖每个垸子成长的历史；荒洲就是这样变成良田的。这些良田是地主的吗？不！地主们是用比强盗还卑劣的手段从劳动人民手里抢去的。
    二、地主掠到土地以后
    这里土地集中到惊人的程度。据湘阴、汉寿、沅江三县七个村的调查，仅占人口百分之三的地主，即占土地总额的百分之六十一。这还只是代表一般地区。较突出的如湘阴全县占户口百分之一·八的地主，即占土地总额的百分之七十一；其中个别地区，几乎全部土地为地主所占有。如锡安区康宁垸，地主占有全垸土地的百分之九十以上。
    一切罪恶的剥削，就在这个基础上产生了。当农民谈及他们被剥削的情景时，凄惨地说：“没有田作啊，不让他们（地主）摆布，又怎么办？”是的，地主就是利用农民“没有田作”，向他们进行押金、地租、高利贷等多种剥削。这些剥削方法彼此结合，像一条铁炼一样紧紧地束缚着农民。
    地租租额，一般为每亩一石五斗至两石，形式上约占每亩常年正产量（三石到四石）的百分之四十到五十，实际上要高到百分之六十或七十。因为地主按“毛亩”索租，“毛亩”是包括了不能耕作的房屋、路基、牛棚等地基，以及地主出租写佃约时，以少写多的虚数在内的。通常实耕田仅占“毛亩”三分之二，或更少些，这便大大加重了租额。
    农民佃田时须先缴“押金”，每亩多为三石，是一种野蛮的额外剥削。地主们在计算“押金”时，又常“因时制宜”地将谷折钱，或将钱折谷，折的价格由地主决定。农民常因此负债终身或破产。
    湘阴普庆垸地主李炳炎的佃户，永远忘记不了李炳炎是怎样地将押金以钱折谷，来加重剥削他们。一九四五年，国民党宣布禁用银元。李炳炎硬把殷春生开始租地时缴的一百四十块银洋的押金，折成了十四石谷（当时市价每石谷仅三元）后，又以押金“少”，叫春生再拿出十一石谷。自耕农王锡林是这样破产的：一九三二年，他借了李炳炎二十五石谷，第二年还不起，就被李炳炎利上加利，把十二亩七分田（内有三亩祖坟地），全部夺去抵了债。田仍由王锡林种着，并逼着他拿出三十石谷的押金，随即又欠了新债，不到几年光景，王锡林家里所有的树木、家具、房屋等，便都成了李炳炎的财产。
    李炳炎的剥削事实和本领，在滨湖农村，并不突出，用当地农民的话来说，还只是个三五百亩的“小角色”，当然他不能与“洲土大王”们相比，即比起另一“小角色”蔡策勋，也还逊色。
    蔡策勋是沅江二区五村的地主。七月初，当我们从益阳经沅江到湘阴时，曾听到许多农民对他痛恨的控诉。这里只谈一件：
    一九四四年，日寇侵入沅江时，风声很紧，蔡策勋把家务连同十几亩橘园及一块荒地，交雇工向菊秋代管，仓惶到亲戚家逃难。临走时他对雇工说，回来时平分橘园的产品。第二年蔡策勋回来了，向菊秋靠了全家辛劳，已把橘园培植得十分繁茂，挂满硕大的蜜橘，还有一个月就可丰收了。蔡策勋见财眼红，心生鬼计，硬说向菊秋偷卖了他的家具，把菊秋押送乡公所去坐牢。邻舍们同情向菊秋，把他保释出来，蔡又使出更毒手段，一夜，派枪兵逼着向菊秋离村，不走，就要拉出去打死。一场丰收的希望，变成了眼泪：向菊秋不但没分到蜜橘，一年工资也落了空，深更半夜，他带着妻儿，一步一回头地离开那即将丰收的橘园，叫着苍天，逃难他乡。这样，蔡策勋全部吞占了三百多担蜜橘，百多石红薯和一部棉花。
    至于那些“洲土大王”，如南县的汤东荪、湘阴的陈锡珊、沅江的王一华、汉寿的高耀林等，在他们所统治的大块地区上——他们都霸占着十几个到几十个垸子的大部或一部土地，延绵达数十里，农民就是他们的奴隶，任他们抢掠和屠杀。诸如：一九二三年，高耀林带着二百多打手，武装抢劫全固垸农民的菜子，满满装走四只“大帮子船”。王一华常在青黄不接的时候，强迫佃户提早缴租，缴不起的就记在账上，秋后以每石谷五斗利索还。一九三七年提早收租时，又东垸有个姓曹的佃户，被逼情急，打伤了两个催租的枪兵，第二天王一华即通知乡公所增派了两挺机枪，十二个枪兵，捉住曹某，说他是“暴徒”，立即枪杀了。佃户们畏于王一华的淫威，只好忍气吞声，任凭摆布。
    于是，在这号称“米仓”的滨湖区，出现了一幅罪恶与悲惨的景图：一面是“洲土大王”们的荒淫享乐。湘阴陈锡珊用农民血汗换来的稻谷，填满了高大的“万石仓”，在长沙修建起美丽的洋房；沅江王一华终夜聚众狂赌，输赢动辄数百亩，酒海肉山的尽情挥霍，连豢养的两只洋狗，每天也吃一斤肉；南县汤东荪出嫁女儿时，餐餐“美援”大米，曾以三十多石谷给女婿订制了一把金盒牙刷——这是一个农民两年多的生活啊！另一面的农民呢？终年辛勤地劳动在土地上却不得温饱，成年不断的吃着碎米和野草。滨湖流行着一首描述农民生活的民谣：“滨湖地方‘好赚钱’，一去二三年；想要回家看母亲，‘冒得’（没有）过河钱。”深刻地反映了农民们未来滨湖前的希望，和遭受残酷剥削后，极其贫困的无限酸辛。
    三、“强占山、霸管水”
    当农民们缴不起租谷，押金被扣光了，家产荡尽，无力种田的时候，只有靠双手到柴山（未开发的荒洲）去打柴，或下湖捕鱼来生活。据调查，湘阴锡安区就有一万多樵民；去年到洞庭东湖打柴的有三四万人。渔民呢？益阳三区有一千一百多户；沅江全县三千多户，湘阴锡安区有八千户。洞庭湖十一县樵民和渔民数目是很大的。
    他们依然逃不脱残酷的封建剥削。这里是“强占山、霸管水”的世界。每个湖，每座山，都被强暴者掠为己有。沅江恶霸地主皮东清，曾强占过从沅江到岳阳间的大小鱼湖。汉寿“洲土大王”高耀林霸占有信阳洲等五六个柴山。
    樵民们一天辛苦得来的柴，柴山老板（地主）硬要抽去百分之二十至四十，人工、运费还得由樵民自己出。有的老板不要柴，按镰刀索柴课，不管你打多打少，每年（只有六七月能打柴）每张镰要缴谷四石左右。在飘尾，一个姓王的大地主来收过一次；伪岳阳县政府来收过一次；国民党军官总队也来收过一次。每把镰刀却收去了八石谷。樵民对那个也不敢不给，有时双方争索柴课，发生殴斗时，遭殃的也是樵民。
    渔民在湖里捕鱼，必须缴“渔课”，一般占捕鱼量百分之四十到六十。“洲土大王”更购置专事巡湖索课的汽轮、木船，威风凛凛地在各鱼湖中来往巡视。前年，渔民余长生（沅江一区）快过年了，还没有一粒米，乘夜架船到日落滩湖，想捕点鱼换米过年。不幸被巡湖的碰上了，当场把鱼网扯得稀烂，鱼也没收了；湖主还吩咐保长罚了他五块银洋。他那里拿得出，眼睁睁看着一家人的命根子——渔船，被湖主划走。
    此外，渔民们还受着国民党的“月捐”、“渔业工会会员费”等征课，及鱼行的高利贷和佣金等中间剥削。
    许多农民都说：“要谈苦呀，我们还赶不上他们（樵民和渔民）。”
    四、人祸带来天灾
    伴随着残酷的封建剥削，是一次又一次的水灾。有的垸子七年之中溃垸三年，也有一年内连遭两次水淹。以一九四九年（当时尚未解放）为例，滨湖十一县共溃决堤垸四四一个，淹没垸田一、七四二、○○○亩，另有垸堤虽未溃决，渍水成灾的垸田二、五三三、○○○亩。农村经济遭受严重破坏，计减少稻谷产量一千四百九十余万石，使一百二十余万灾民，流离失所，陷于极端困苦的境地。
    激流中跑了农民的茅房、牲口、农具，吞没了将要收割的稻禾，不少人被夺去了生命，这是天灾；但是，这天灾是由人祸带来的。亲身经历了两个不同世界，解放一年后的滨湖农民，看得更清楚。今年四月间，华容新生大垸的修复工程完工了，远近一万五千余农民赶来祝贺，并送了一幅生动的对联：“六十年来，封建地主修堤，总是溃口；个半月里，翻身农民挽垸，一举成功。”为什么封建地主修堤总是溃口呢？在我们这次访问中曾不止一次的听到农民们这样说：今年垸堤修得坚实，如无意外大水，可保无事。往年修堤的经费都比今年多，真正用在堤上的最多超不过四成，其余的被堤务局委员们塞进腰包，或者是住旅馆、嫖妓女、吃大餐以“事务费”的名义报销了。真的把农民们拿出的堤经费、渔课、和“堤贷”都用在堤工上，垸堤是能够不溃的。
    滨湖各垸均设有堤务局，解放前为地主劣绅把持。当权地主常把名义上东佃各出一半的修堤费，用虚报、挪移种种办法，全部或大部转嫁到佃户及小农户的身上。
    堤务局委员们并不将治水防灾放在心上，而是把堤务局当成贪污自肥和尽情挥霍的机关。就拿抢险来说吧，购买防汛器材的钱款，作为“事务费”——包括旅馆费、招待费、旅费……报销了，大水发来，便手忙脚乱的派枪兵拆掉农民的房子，收敛破被烂席，赶着农民去抢险，洪水冲垮了垸堤，委员们又可借口“赔偿农民损失”，趁机发一笔“抢险财”。各垸堤务局开支“事务费”通常占总经费百分之六十以上。汉寿县太和垸堤务局半年的账目，各种事务费名目十数项，纸张费一项即为十八石米，烟丝费是七石米。沣县七里湖地主周承霖当堤务主任时，曾利用修堤贷款，做了一笔生意。他以银洋二元一角一石谷计算，领了三百石谷的“贷款”，只花一元八角钱一石，买到三百石谷；待谷价涨到四元时，再把谷卖掉；又用这笔款，放了一次“拆息”（一种短期高利贷）。于是，周承霖由拥有二百亩骤增至七百亩田了。这在滨湖是很普通的事实。
    再看，垸堤溃决时的事实：湘阴县十一区余家垸，地主易景山当堤务主任，除按每亩收三斗堤费外，还向伪政府贷了七百石谷和二两四钱金子的“贷款”。“贷款”经伪省参议员胡达、县参议员刘爱山层层贪污，钱款到垸子，又被易景山一伙“预支”了，堤却未修，也没准备防汛器材。农民们着急了，去问易景山，易景山说：“我们的土质好，浪越打土越紧”。五月十七日夜，大风浪来了，堤上的土一块块崩下来，农民们急忙找堤务局，易景山就在这风浪紧急的时候溜走了，眼巴巴看着溃了堤。接连又淹没了马眼、复兴、林新垸等三垸一万三千亩良田。和丰垸去年未溃垸。前年水位比去年低二、三尺，垸堤本可不溃；水势正紧，堤务主任廖子成（地主）到外垸催租去了，留下他的走狗刘仕卿（堤工长）在局主持，六月二十日有几个农民，发现在廖子成田的附近堤上，有漏洞浸进水来，当即鸣锣救险，刘仕卿极力阻挡（因为，按老章程，在谁田里堵口，谁出抢险费，他想替主子节省些钱财），并用手枪把农民赶散；随后就和一些狐群狗党喝酒打牌去了，漏洞越冲越大，大水灌进了和丰垸，刘仕卿还在和朋友们玩牌。就这样，三万余亩即将收割的稻禾，两万多人民的财产，葬送在这个小流氓手里了。
    是天灾，也是人祸。是谁造成的贫困与灾难？还不明显吗？
