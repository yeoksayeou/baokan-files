Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. MacArthur, the chief culprit of American aggression in the Far East, flew from Japan to Taiwan on July 31st to hold meetings with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and then left Taiwan on August 1st to return to Japan. This is a step by the United States to more openly aggress against our country's Taiwan. MacArthur stated upon leaving Taiwan and returning to Japan that executing Truman's policy, announced on July 26th, of controlling Taiwan with American military force, was his "responsibility and firm purpose." In his statement, MacArthur threatened the Chinese people, saying: "If the hostile forces are foolish enough to attempt an attack, we will be able to respond more effectively. In my personal opinion, this attack has little hope of success." MacArthur's statement hinted at the United Press report regarding the idea that "Nationalist troops may be placed under MacArthur's command," saying: "Effective means of communication between the U.S. military and the Chinese government (referring to the Kuomintang remnants) armies have been completed." This means that the American armed interventionists are not limited to "ordering the Seventh Fleet to prevent any attack on Taiwan," but will further invade Taiwan, turning the Kuomintang bandit troops into a part of the American invading army, vainly attempting to prevent our people from liberating our sacred territory of Taiwan.
　　
Prior to MacArthur's visit to Taiwan, American armed interventionists had intensified their aggressive activities against Taiwan. Since July 16th, the U.S. Seventh Fleet has begun so-called "maritime and aerial reconnaissance" in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, and has established maritime and aerial liaison agencies with the Kuomintang remnants. The American government's institutions for controlling Taiwan have also been strengthened. Rankin, the former U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong, has been transferred to Taiwan as Minister and Chargé d'Affaires, and Rear Admiral Jarrett has been appointed as Naval Attaché to Taiwan.

　　麦克阿瑟飞赴台湾准备更公开地侵略
    妄想阻我解放我神圣国土
    【新华社三日讯】美国在远东的侵略罪魁麦克阿瑟，于七月三十一日由日本飞抵台湾，与蒋介石匪帮举行会议，之后即于八月一日离台返日。这是美国更公开地侵略我国台湾的步骤。麦克阿瑟于离台返日时发表声明说：执行杜鲁门七月二十六日所宣布的由美国武力控制台湾的政策，是他的“责任与坚决的目的”。麦克阿瑟在声明中恫吓中国人民说：“敌对力量如果愚蠢到企图发动攻击，则我们更能作有效的应付。就我个人看来，这一攻击很少有成功的希望。”麦克阿瑟的声明暗示了合众社记者所报道的关于“国民党军队可能交由麦克阿瑟指挥”的说法，他说：“美军与中国政府（按指国民党残匪）军队间的有效联系办法业已完成。”这就是说，美国武装干涉者已不限于“命令第七舰队阻止对台湾的任何攻击”，而且将进一步地侵占台湾，把国民党匪军变为美国侵略军的一部分，妄想阻止我国人民解放我们的神圣国土台湾。
    在麦克阿瑟赴台之前，美国武装干涉者已加紧其对台湾的侵略活动。自七月十六日起，美国第七舰队已开始在台湾海峡和南海进行所谓“海空侦察”，并与国民党残匪建立了海空联络机构。美国政府控制台湾的机构亦已加强，原在香港的美国总领事兰金已调任驻台公使兼代办，美海军少将贾芮特亦被任为驻台海军武官。
