　　Changchun Railway Bureau's Locomotive No. 576
　　Creates Highest Record for Extending Class A Inspections.
    Operating 220,000 kilometers in 27 months without a Class A inspection, the locomotive's condition remains good.
    [Our Newspaper Changchun News] The Wen T6 Locomotive No. 576 of the Changchun Railway Bureau, extended its Class A inspection for 220,000 kilometers from April 1948 to July 7th of this year, setting a national record. After detailed inspection by the Railway Bureau's Party, government, labor union, youth league, Soviet maintenance engineers, and other relevant departments, the locomotive's condition is still good. The contracted crew is now working hard to continue extending the Class A inspection by 30,000 kilometers. This locomotive was originally a dead locomotive, and after being repaired, it consumed excessive coal and had low traction. After being contracted by the Meng Xianggang crew, the root cause was found, re-repaired, and with good maintenance work, this locomotive became stronger day by day, climbing mountains, crossing the Mudanjiang River, entering Shanhaiguan, and arriving in Beijing, undertaking the glorious task of escorting Chairman Mao to Manchuria. Without undergoing a Class A inspection for a full twenty-seven months, it saved a lot of wealth for the country. It received an award from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions this "May Day". Three of the nine crew members are Communist Party members, and five are Youth League members. (Meng Xiangrui, Lu Chengyuan)

　　长春机务段五七六号机车
　　创延长甲检最高纪录
    廿七个月中运行廿二万公里没有甲检，机车状况仍良好。
    【本报长春讯】长春铁路机务段文Ｔ６五七六号机车，从一九四八年四月到今年七月七日，延长甲检二十二万公里，创全国最高纪录。经该机务段党、政、工、团及苏联检修工程师与其他有关部门详细检查，机车状况仍然良好。该包车组现正为继续延长甲检三万公里而努力。该机车原是一台死机车，修复后又费煤、牵引力又小。经孟宪刚包车组包乘后，始找出病根，重新修理，加上保养工作做得好，这台机车就一天比一天健壮起来，爬山越岭，跑过牡丹江，也进过山海关到过北京，担当过送毛主席到满洲里的光荣任务。在整整二十七个月中没有进行甲检，为国家节省了很多财富。今年“五一”受到东北总工会的奖励。九个乘务员中有三名是中共党员，五名是团员。（孟祥瑞、陆成垣）
