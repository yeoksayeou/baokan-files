Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 20th. In many public and private factories in Shanghai, serious casualties have occurred due to a lack of attention to safety and hygiene. According to incomplete statistics from the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, from September of last year to the end of July this year, 669 workers were injured or killed. In July alone, 101 workers were injured and 6 died. The causes of the casualties, in addition to difficult objective material conditions and rudimentary factory equipment, are mainly the insufficient attention paid to safety and hygiene by the administrative side and capitalists of various factories, and the more or less existing erroneous view of "valuing machines more than people." In the past ten months, 423 factories experienced accidents, resulting in property losses of over 1.5 billion yuan, with fires accounting for 80 percent. Due to poor equipment, many workers are suffering from serious illnesses. For example, in the state-owned linen mill, 83 workers suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis and cough up blood, accounting for 6 percent of the factory's total workforce. Recently, the weather has been hot, and many factories have poor ventilation equipment and excessively high temperatures in the workshops, which has greatly damaged the health of workers. For example, in the private Shenxin No. 5 Factory, five workers fainted in one day. Another cause of casualties is the negligence of factory management and the lack of inspection systems. For example, Xu Dalun, a worker at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, entered a cold air cylinder to clean it. The engineer closed the cylinder door without inspection, resulting in Xu's suffocation and death. Some factory owners, in order to save on wages, hire apprentices and temporary workers to do technical work, and they often cause accidents due to their lack of technical proficiency.

In order to quickly improve factory safety and hygiene work, the Municipal Safety and Hygiene Committee has convened various meetings to study concrete measures, and organized inspection teams to conduct key inspections in factories such as Shanghai Iron and Steel Company and Asia Iron and Steel Plant in order to learn from experience and guide general factories. The committee also hired 43 experts on factory safety and hygiene issues as members to participate in research and improvement work. The Municipal People's Government Health Bureau has completed physical examinations of employees at the State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 17. The East China Textile Administration allocated 1 billion yuan in June to improve factory safety and hygiene equipment, and 80 percent of state-owned cotton mills have now improved sanitary facilities such as toilets, bathrooms, and drinking water. The yarn factory trade unions have organized inspection teams by districts such as Hudong and Huxi, and conduct mutual inspections using the weekly shutdown days of each factory. Dozens of units, including the Public Utilities Motor Factory, Hongwen Paper Mill, and Tianxiang Cement Plant, have established safety and hygiene committees and established operating procedures and regular inspection systems.

　　上海若干工厂忽视安全卫生工作
    发生严重伤亡现象
    现已采取具体办法进行纠正
    【新华社上海二十日电】上海市不少公私营工厂，由于不重视安全卫生工作，发生严重的伤亡现象。据上海市人民政府劳动局的不完全统计，自去年九月至今年七月底止，伤亡工人达六百六十九人，仅七月份即伤一百零一人，死六人。造成伤亡的原因，除客观物质条件困难、工厂设备简陋外，主要是各厂行政方面和资方对安全卫生工作重视不够，还或多或少的存在着“只重机器不重人”的错误观点。十个月中发生意外事件的工厂有四百二十三家，损失资财达十五亿以上，其中火灾占百分之八十。不少工厂由于设备差，工人患病情况严重，如国营麻纺厂害肺病吐血的有八十三人，占该厂工人总数的百分之六。最近天气炎热，许多工厂通风设备差，车间温度过高，工人健康大受损害，如私营申新五厂在一天内有五个工人晕倒。发生伤亡的另一个原因，是工厂管理疏忽，缺乏检查制度。如上海电力公司工人徐大轮进入冷气缸打扫，工程师未经检查，将缸门关上，以致徐被闷死。有些厂方为了贪图少出工资，雇用学徒和临时工去做技术工作，他们因为技术不熟练而肇祸的也不少。
    为迅速做好工厂安全卫生工作，目前市安全卫生委员会已召开各种会议，研究具体办法，并组织检查小组，到上海钢铁公司、亚细亚钢铁厂等工厂中，进行重点检查，以便吸取经验，指导一般工厂；该委员会并聘请四十三位工厂安全卫生问题专家为委员，参加研究改进工作。市人民政府卫生局已在国营棉纺十七厂完成了职工体格检查。华东纺织管理局已于六月间拨款十亿作为改进工厂安全卫生设备的费用，现在国营棉纺厂已有十分之八改进了厕所、浴室、饮水等卫生设备。纱厂工会按沪东、沪西等区组织检查组，利用各厂每星期停工日，互相进行检查。公用电机厂、宏文造纸厂、天祥水泥厂等数十单位已建立了安全卫生委员会，订立了操作规程、定期检查等制度。
