    Good Harvest of Sorghum and Millet
    [Shanghai News] *Jiefang Daily* news: A good harvest of sorghum and millet has been reported in Tengxian Special District, Shandong Province, and harvesting is now underway. Generally, sorghum can yield about 300 *jin* per *mu*, and millet is no less than 250 *jin*. Three farmers from Shantou Village, Yangzhuang District, Tengxian County, who were harvesting sorghum, said to passing cadres: Our crops here have never been so good since the War of Resistance Against Japan. At present, the farmers in the special district are harvesting on the one hand and tidying up their farm tools and starting to cultivate the land on the other. According to the current situation, there is also hope for a good harvest of beans and sweet potatoes.
    [Our Newspaper, Wuyang News] Wuyang County, Henan Province, has begun harvesting early autumn crops. The peasants, who have turned over a new leaf, are busy harvesting their own crops for the first time. The farmers said happily, "In previous years, the autumn harvest was gone as soon as the rent was paid to the landlord; this year, it's all ours!" According to the farmers, this year's early autumn harvest is not bad, with sorghum yielding 180 to 200 *jin* per *mu*; millet production has decreased slightly due to excessive rainfall, but still has a 70% yield, with about 4 *dou* and 5 *sheng* (30 *jin* per *dou*) per *mu*. Except for some flood-stricken areas, the general late autumn crops are also growing well, late rice has headed, corn has developed red tassels, and sesame has also bloomed. It is estimated that the late autumn harvest will be no less than the early autumn harvest. (Lü Chengtao)

　　山东滕县专区等地早秋开始收割
    高粱谷子丰收
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：山东滕县专区高粱、谷子均告丰收，现正开始进行收割。高粱一般每亩可收三百斤左右，谷子亦不下二百五十斤。滕县杨庄区山头村三个收割高粱的农民对过路的干部说：我们这里从抗日战争以来，庄稼收成就没有这样好过。现该专区农民正一面收割，一面整理农具，动手耕地。以目前情况看，豆子、地瓜也有丰收的希望。
    【本报舞阳讯】河南舞阳县已开始收早秋。翻身后的农民，第一次为收获自己的庄稼而忙碌着。农民们高兴地说：“往常年的秋收，给地主一缴租就光了；今年都是咱自己的了！”据农民们说，今年的早秋收成不坏，高粱每亩可收一百八十斤到二百斤；谷子因雨水过多而稍有减产，但亦有七成收成，每亩可收四斗五升（每斗三十市斤）左右。除部分水灾区外，一般晚秋亦成长良好，晚谷已吐穗，玉茭已出红缨，芝麻亦已开花。据估计，晚秋收成将不亚于早秋。（吕承陶）
