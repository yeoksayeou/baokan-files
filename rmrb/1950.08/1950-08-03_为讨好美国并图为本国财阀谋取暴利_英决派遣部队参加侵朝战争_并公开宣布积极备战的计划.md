　　To Please the United States and Seek Huge Profits for Domestic Conglomerates
    Britain Decides to Send Troops to Participate in the Korean War
    And Publicly Announces Plans for Active War Preparations
    [Xinhua News Agency, 2nd] Under constant pressure from the United States, and also attempting to seek huge profits for British monopoly capitalists, the British Labour government has decided to send a force to participate in the war of aggression against Korea, and has publicly announced plans to step up military expansion and war preparations.
    According to a London dispatch from the British Information Office: British Defense Minister Shinwell stated in the House of Commons on July 26th: "The British government notified the United Nations on the 26th that the British government is willing to send actual combat troops and the administrative organizations needed to supply these troops to Korea." This combat force of approximately 3,500 to 4,000 men will be dispatched to Korea "as quickly as possible." Shinwell also announced: The British government will allocate an additional 100 million pounds on top of this year's huge military expenditure to be used for war preparations. Shinwell also announced to the House of Commons on the same day that the British Far East Fleet had been ordered to make full wartime preparations, and naval demobilization would be halted. Prior to this, the British government had passed a new plan for recruiting air force personnel on July 25th.
    British Prime Minister Attlee, in a broadcast speech to the nation on July 30th, reiterated the British government's imperialist policy of actively preparing for war. In his speech, Attlee asked the British people to expand the regular army, increase the number of technical personnel in the military, and increase local conscripts. Attlee acknowledged that military expansion meant "a sacrifice," but he asked the British people to accept this sacrifice. When talking about sending land, sea, and air forces to serve as accomplices in the American aggression against Korea, Attlee flattered the United States by saying, "Sharing the burden of the United States is the responsibility of the British government."

　　为讨好美国并图为本国财阀谋取暴利
    英决派遣部队参加侵朝战争
    并公开宣布积极备战的计划
    【新华社二日讯】英国工党政府在美国不断的压力下，同时也企图为英国垄断资本家谋取暴利，业决定派遣一支部队，参加侵略朝鲜的战争，并公开宣布加紧实行扩军备战的计划。
    据英国新闻处伦敦消息：英国防大臣辛威尔于七月二十六日在下院宣称：“英政府二十六日已通知联合国称：英政府愿意派遣实际作战部队以及供应这批部队所需的行政机构赴朝鲜。”此项作战部队约三千五百人至四千人，将“尽速”开往朝鲜。辛威尔同时宣布：英政府将在本年度巨额军费之外再增拨一亿镑，以充战争准备之用。辛威尔又于同日向下院宣布：英远东舰队已奉命作全面战时准备，海军复员将行停止。二十八日，英国陆军部又明令陆军正规军停止退役，并宣布有限度地征召正规陆军后备队。在此以前，英国政府曾于七月二十五日通过了招募空军的新计划。
    英首相艾德礼七月三十日在向全国发表的广播演说中，再次重申英国政府积极备战的帝国主义政策。艾德礼在演说中向英国人要求扩充正规军，增加军中各种技术人员，并增加地方新兵入伍。艾德礼承认扩军意味着“一种牺牲”，但他要求英国人民接受这种牺牲。艾德礼在谈及派遣陆海空军充当美国侵略朝鲜的帮凶时，讨好美国说：“分担美国的负担，是英国政府的责任”。
