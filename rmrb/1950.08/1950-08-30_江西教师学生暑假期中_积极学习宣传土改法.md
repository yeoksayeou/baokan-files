Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 28th—During the summer vacation, approximately 45,000 teachers and young students in Jiangxi Province's schools at all levels engaged in the study and promotion of the Land Reform Law. In Nanchang City, summer rural work teams composed of teachers and students from 27 primary and secondary schools publicized the Land Reform Law in rural areas near the city. Prefectures such as Jiujiang, Ganzhou, Nanchang, and Ji'an sent summer Land Reform Law propaganda teams led by county and city people's governments to work in the countryside for 20 days. The students and teachers participating in these teams personally witnessed the illegal activities of some landlords, such as distributing land and grain and destroying production tools. Consequently, they changed the muddled thinking of some teachers and students, who previously believed that landlords became wealthy through "hard work," and gained a preliminary understanding of the suffering of the peasant masses under the oppression of the feudal land system. During their time in the countryside, they were able to put aside the "airs" of intellectuals, immerse themselves in the lives of the peasants, and experience their hardships in order to transform their own ideological consciousness. Through gatherings, informal talks, theatrical performances, and other methods, they publicized the policies of the Land Reform Law, initially dispelling the concerns of some peasants regarding land reform and the development of production. They further inspired the peasants' desire to organize themselves, helping them establish and expand their peasant associations, thereby strengthening the peasant ranks.

　　江西教师学生暑假期中
    积极学习宣传土改法
    【新华社南昌二十八日电】江西省各级学校在暑假期间约有四万五千个教师和青年学生，进行了土地改革法的学习和宣传活动。南昌市有二十七个中小学校的教师、学生所组成的暑期下乡工作队，在该市附近农村宣传土地改革法。九江、赣州、南昌、吉安等专区由县、市人民政府所领导的暑期土地改革法宣传队，下乡工作了二十天。参加该队的学生和教师们亲眼看到部分地主分散土地、粮食和破坏生产工具等非法活动，因而改变了一部分师生过去认为地主是“勤劳发家”的糊涂思想，并初步认识到农民群众在封建土地制度压迫下所遭受的痛苦。他们在下乡期间，都能放下知识分子的“架子”，深入到农民群众中去，体会农民生活，以改造自己的思想意识；并通过集会、漫谈、演剧等方式，宣传土地改革法的政策，开始消除了部分农民群众对土地改革和发展生产的顾虑，并进一步启发了农民对组织起来的要求，帮助农民建立和扩大了自己的农会，从而壮大了农民队伍。
