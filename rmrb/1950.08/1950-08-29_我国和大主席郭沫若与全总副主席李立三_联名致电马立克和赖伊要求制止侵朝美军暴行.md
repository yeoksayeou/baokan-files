Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, and Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, jointly telegraphed Malik, President of the United Nations Security Council, and Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, on August 28th, protesting the inhuman atrocities of the American invading army in Korea. The telegram is as follows:
To Mr. Malik, President of the United Nations Security Council, and Mr. Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations:

Our delegation, composed of twenty-three representatives from us and other Chinese people's organizations, arrived in Pyongyang, Korea, on August 14th to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the August 15th Korean Liberation. We stayed there for eight days and visited Seoul, Wonsan, and other places. We personally witnessed the American invading army indiscriminately bombing and strafing peaceful cities and villages in the rear of Korea, destroying many schools, churches, hospitals, and residential houses, and causing heavy casualties among women, children, the old, and the weak. The inhuman atrocities committed by the American invading army against the peaceful people of Korea surpass those of the Japanese imperialists five years ago.

Our delegation requests the United Nations Security Council to swiftly stop the bestial atrocities of the United States and take appropriate measures to immediately withdraw the American invading army from Korea in order to restore peace in the Far East.

In addition, our delegation personally witnessed that American prisoners of war enjoy reasonable treatment in Pyongyang, Seoul, and other places. We believe that the Security Council should inform the world of this humanitarian spirit expressed by the Korean people, which is in stark contrast to the atrocities of the American army.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee
Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
August 28th

　　我国和大主席郭沫若与全总副主席李立三
    联名致电马立克和赖伊要求制止侵朝美军暴行
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若、中华全国总工会副主席李立三二十八日联名致电联合国安理会主席马立克及联合国秘书长赖伊，抗议美国侵略军在朝鲜的非人暴行。电文如下：联合国安理会主席马立克先生及联合国秘书长赖伊先生：
    我们和其他中国人民团体代表共二十三人所组成的代表团为了庆祝“八一五”朝鲜解放五周年纪念，曾于八月十四日到达朝鲜平壤，在该地停留八日，并曾赴汉城、元山等地视察，亲见美国侵略军给朝鲜后方和平城市及乡村滥肆轰炸扫射，毁坏学校、教堂、医院、居民住宅甚多，杀伤妇孺老弱甚重。美国侵略军给朝鲜和平人民的这种残无人道的暴行，视五年前日本帝国主义者的暴行有过之而无不及。
    我们的代表团要求联合国安全理事会迅速制止美国的兽性暴行，并迅速采取适当措施，使美国侵略军立即退出朝鲜，以便恢复远东和平。
    此外，我们的代表团亲见美军俘虏在平壤、汉城等地享受合理待遇。我们认为安全理事会应当把朝鲜人民所表示的这种与美军暴行恰恰相反的人道主义精神告诉全世界。
   中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席  郭沫若
   中华全国总工会副主席  李立三
    八月二十八日
