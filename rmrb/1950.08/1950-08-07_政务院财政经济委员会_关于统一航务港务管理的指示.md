From the management situation and experience of navigation and port affairs over the past year, it is proven that in order to strengthen the management of navigation and port affairs, facilitate shipping, promote the exchange of goods, and strengthen the public security of port areas, it is urgent to formulate unified regulations, laws, and systems for the management of navigation and port affairs, and to establish unified navigation and port management agencies. To this end, the following decisions are made:

(A) Establish unified navigation and port management agencies – the Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government and local port authorities, and gradually promulgate unified management regulations, laws, and systems for navigation and port affairs.

	(1) The Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government shall immediately begin collecting various materials related to the management of navigation and port affairs, conduct systematic research, and draft plans for management regulations, laws, systems, etc., which shall be submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for review and approval, and then submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and implementation.

	(2) District port authorities shall be established in major domestic ports such as Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Dalian to be responsible for the unified management of port affairs. In other ports, port sub-bureaus or offices may be established as needed, under the leadership of the aforementioned major port district port authorities. The specific division of jurisdiction of each port authority and the specific establishment and detailed rules of procedure for sub-bureaus and offices shall be separately determined by the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government.

(B) The tasks, scope of work, and leadership relations of the port authorities:

	(1) The port authorities shall manage the following matters in accordance with the unified management regulations, laws, and systems for navigation and port affairs promulgated by the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government:

	(1) Dredging and icebreaking of port channels and removal of obstacles.

	(2) Planning the improvement and construction of port channels, as well as the construction, maintenance, and management of navigation mark aids and water supply facilities in the port area.

	(3) Repair, construction, maintenance, and unified management and dispatch of wharves, warehouses, and other facilities.

	(4) Registration, measurement, and inspection of ships.

	(5) Pilotage work and management of pilots.

	(6) Approval of ship import and export.

	(7) Collection and reporting of meteorological information and hydrological changes.

	(8) Unified collection of various port wharf fees.

	(9) Examination, assessment, and management of crew members.

	(10) Registration and management of the shipping industry.

	(11) Handling of maritime affairs.

	(12) Guidance and improvement in port business and technology.

All navigation and port information and measures related to national defense shall be reported to the naval authorities at any time, and assistance and guidance may be requested from the naval authorities when necessary.

	(2) Local port authorities are subordinate institutions of the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government. Except for the Yangtze River Administration and the Qingdao District Port Authority, in order to facilitate management, it is decided that the Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Dalian District Port Authorities shall be temporarily managed by the local municipal people's governments.

	(3) The port authorities entrusted with management shall report and request instructions from the local municipal people's government regarding their main work tasks, and shall simultaneously submit a copy to the Ministry of Transportation. The municipal people's governments where the port authorities are located shall periodically submit written reports and requests for instructions to the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government regarding the work of the port authorities entrusted with management.

	(4) Port authorities must establish an independent accounting system, and a budget and final account system shall be established for various fee incomes and various construction expenditures. All budget books, financial reports, and plans shall be submitted by the directly leading local municipal people's government to the Ministry of Transportation for review and approval in accordance with the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on unified financial and economic work before implementation or reimbursement. The municipal people's governments in charge shall not transfer the income of the port authorities for other purposes.

	(5) The existing personnel of various departments of the port authorities in the entrusted management areas shall be appropriately adjusted by the local municipal people's governments in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government regarding fixed staffing and quotas. The appointment and removal of the director and deputy director of the port authority must be reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for review and approval by the Government Administration Council.

(C) Several specific issues:

	(1) The wharf warehouses in the wharf area of each port, which were used by various ministries and their affiliated agencies of the puppet central government before liberation, or are currently used by central enterprises and local public enterprises, except for the wharf warehouses belonging to the navy and railway stations, shall be taken back by the port authority for unified management and dispatch. However, the port authority shall appropriately take into account the specific needs of various agencies and enterprises when dispatching. The Chinese and foreign private wharf warehouses currently located in the port wharf area shall be subject to unified management in accordance with the unified management regulations and laws promulgated by the People's Government.

	(2) The following tasks shall be managed by other competent departments, but the port authority must maintain close contact and division of labor with them:

	(1) The import and export inspection, registration, and tariff collection of goods shall be uniformly handled by the customs department.

	(2) The public security work inside and outside the port shall be managed by the Maritime Public Security Bureau, but must obey the guidance of the port authority in terms of port business and technology.

	(3) The work of seaport quarantine, fumigation, disinfection, and isolation and treatment of patients shall be uniformly managed by the health department, but must obey the guidance of the port authority in terms of navigation and port business and technology.

	(4) In order to simplify procedures and unify various inspection works, relevant departments shall establish a joint inspection office, uniformly under the leadership of the director of the port authority.

	(5) The planning and management of waterway surveying and aids to navigation, and the publication of navigation publications, shall be handled jointly with the naval authorities if they are of a maritime and national defense nature. Aids to navigation shall also be subject to the guidance of the naval authorities. Before the navy department directly handles them, the original customs, maritime, river affairs, and port affairs agencies shall be transferred to the Ministry of Transportation for management. All information and measures related to national defense shall be copied by the Ministry of Transportation to the naval headquarters at any time. Ship tax (tonnage tax) shall be uniformly collected by the Ministry of Finance on a quarterly basis, and other port fees shall be uniformly collected and remitted by the port authority.

	(6) The operation and management of state-owned shipping companies, shipping business, and the formulation of freight rates shall be directly led by the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government, but the company must comply with the unified navigation management system and the guidance of the local port authority, and shall not be special.

	(7) The business tax payable for operating wharf warehouses shall be uniformly collected within the business tax payable by the operator of the wharf warehouse.

	(8) The education and organization of dockworkers shall be the responsibility of the local trade union and the government.

It is hoped that the relevant departments and local governments will comply with the above decisions.

　　政务院财政经济委员会
    关于统一航务港务管理的指示
    从一年来航务港务管理情况和经验证明：为加强航务及港务工作的管理，以便利航运，促进货物交流并加强港区治安起见，亟需制定统一航务及港务管理的各项章则、法规和制度，并建立统一的航务港务管理机构。为此，特作以下决定：
    （甲）建立统一航务及港务管理机构——中央人民政府交通部航务总局及各地港务局，并逐步颁布统一管理航务及港务的章则、法规、制度。
    （一）中央人民政府交通部应即着手搜集有关航务及港务管理的各种资料，并加以系统的研究，拟具管理的章则、法规，制度等方案，经政务院财政经济委员会核准并报政务院批准公布施行。
    （二）在国内各重要港埠，如天津、广州、上海、青岛、大连等地设立区港务局，负责统一港务的管理工作。在其他港口，得视需要设港务分局或办事处，受上述重要港埠区港务局之领导。至于各港务局、处管辖区域之划分，及分局办事处之具体设置和办事细则等，由中央人民政府交通部另订之。
    （乙）港务局的任务、工作范围及其领导关系：
    （一）港务局根据中央人民政府交通部颁布的航务、港务的统一管理章则、法规和制度，经管下列各项事宜：
    （１）港口河道之疏浚与破冰及障碍物之清除。
    （２）计划港口航道之改善与施工，以及港区内航路标志助航及给水设备之修建保养与管理。
    （３）码头仓库及其他设备之修缮、建造、养护及统一管理和调度。
    （４）船舶之登记、丈量、检查。
    （５）引水工作和引水人员之管理。
    （６）船舶进出口之批准。
    （７）气象情报及水文变化之汇集与报告。

    （１１）海事之处理。
    （１２）有关港务的业务和技术上之指导与改进。
    凡与国防有关之各项航务、港务资料与措施，均需随时分报海军主管部门，必要时得请海军主管部门予以协助和指导。
    （二）各地港务局为中央人民政府交通部的所属机构，除长江管理局及青岛区港务局外，为便于管理，决定天津、上海、广州、大连区港务局暂委托所在地市人民政府代管之。
    （三）委托代管之港务局，应就主管工作任务向所在地市人民政府报告并请示，同时以副本呈送交通部。各港务局所在地市人民政府，应就所受委托代管之港务局的工作，定期向中央人民政府交通部作书面报告和请示。
    （四）港务局必须建立独立的会计制度，其各种规费收入及各种修建支出，应建立预算和决算制度。所有预算书及财务报告和计划，均报由直属领导之当地市人民政府核转交通部，照中央人民政府政务院统一财经工作的决定核准后施行或报销。代管之市人民政府，不得将港务局之收入移作他用。
    （五）委托代管之各地港务各部门之现有人员，应由当地市人民政府遵照中央人民政府政务院定员定额的指示适当加以调整。港务局局长副局长之任免，须报请政务院财政经济委员会核请政务院决定。
    （丙）几个具体问题：
    （一）各港埠码头区内之码头仓库，在解放前属于伪中央各部会及其所属机关使用者，或现为中央经营，地方公营企业使用者，除属于海军及铁路车站之码头仓库外，一律由港务局收回，统一管理和调度，但港务局在调度时，须适当照顾各机关各企业之具体需要。现属港埠码头区内之中外私营码头仓库，依人民政府颁布之统一管理章则、法令，予以统一管理。
    （二）下述各项任务，分别由其他主管部门管理，但港务局必须与之经常取得密切联系和分工合作：
    （１）货物之出入口检查、登记及关税之征收，统一由海关部门负责办理。
    （２）港内外之治安工作，由水上公安局负责掌管，但在港务之业务和技术上必须服从港务局的指导。
    （３）海港检疫、熏船、消毒及病人之隔离治疗工作，统一由卫生部门负责掌管，但在航务港务之业务和技术上必须服从港务局的指导。

    （５）水道测量和助航设备之建设计划与管理，航行刊物之发行，凡属海务与国防性质者，均应会同海军当局办理。助航设备兼受海军当局之指导，在海军部未直接办理之前，原海关、海务、江务、港务各机构应即移交交通部掌管。凡属国防有关之各项资料与措施应由交通部随时抄送海军司令部。船钞费（吨税）由财政部统一按季征收，其余港口各费，统一由港务局代收解缴。
    （６）国营轮船公司之经营管理，船运业务及运价率之规定，统一由中央人民政府交通部直接领导之，但该公司必须遵行统一的航务管理制度及当地港务局之指导，不得特殊。
    （７）经营码头仓库应缴的营业税，统一于该码头仓库之经营主应纳之营业税内征收。
    （８）码头装卸工人之教育与组织，由当地工会与政府负责。
    以上决定希各有关部门及各地政府遵照执行为要。
