　　Guangdong Work Report
    (Report to the 38th Administrative Meeting of the Government Administration Council on June 27, 1950)
    Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government

　　Guangdong Province includes both mainland and islands, such as the Dongsha Islands, Xisha Islands, Zhongsha Islands, Nansha Islands, and Wanshan Islands. The Guangdong mainland was liberated on October 14th last year, followed by the liberation of Nan'ao, Guiling, Sanzao, Weizhou, and other islands. Hainan Island was liberated on April 29th this year. Currently, the struggle to liberate the Wanshan Islands is underway. Other island areas are still awaiting liberation. However, generally speaking, Guangdong Province can be considered basically liberated.

　　After the liberation of the Guangdong mainland last year, because Hainan Island had not yet been liberated, more than two million people in sixteen of the province's ninety-nine counties were still groaning under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang's organized remnant military forces had not yet been completely eliminated within Guangdong, so the security of the Guangdong mainland and the sea, especially in the minds of the masses, was still somewhat threatened. In order to support the army in quickly eliminating the Kuomintang remnants and allow the people of Guangdong to carry out construction in a peaceful environment, we prioritized supporting the Hainan Island campaign in the previous period. This was an arduous task. Because crossing the sea required sufficient ships and sailors familiar with the sea, it was necessary to establish a long supply line from Guangzhou to the Leizhou Peninsula and build a large support system. The People's Liberation Army, under the direct command of the Central Military Commission and the leaders of the Fourth Field Army, demonstrated doubled efforts and creativity in carrying out this same task. They not only carried out maritime training day and night, overcoming various difficulties and learning all the techniques of crossing the sea and landing, but also provided a lot of help to the local support work. This ensured that the victory of the entire war was organized completely from the front lines to the rear. After these preparations were completed, starting in March, the People's Liberation Army sent out advance troops for exploratory infiltration, and on April 17th, a large-scale offensive began, coordinating with the Hainan Island People's Guerrilla led by Comrade Feng Baiju, defeating the enemy's resistance, liberating Haikou on the 23rd, and liberating the ports of Yulin and Sanya on the 29th, completing the liberation of the entire island of Hainan. The handover work in Hainan is currently underway, and various institutions are being established.

　　The coastal areas of Guangdong and its offshore islands are at the forefront of national defense. The coastline is 2,500 kilometers long, and the coastal islands are scattered like stars, such as the Dongsha, Xisha, Zhongsha, and Nansha Islands, which are very far from the coast. Therefore, Guangdong's actual territory includes a vast sea area. Protecting these islands and coastal ports from being occupied by imperialists and Kuomintang pirates is not only related to protecting our sacred territory, but also directly related to the security of the Guangdong mainland. On the Guangdong mainland, due to the 2,500-kilometer coastline and many river forks and ports, and being close to Hong Kong, Macau, and Vietnam, bandits and secret agents have obtained many favorable conditions, so bandit activity was relatively serious from the early days of liberation until March of this year. For example, in inland provinces and regions, once the bandit armed forces are disarmed, it is difficult for them to reacquire arms; but in Guangdong, because they can contact overseas, especially Hong Kong and Macau, at any time, it is easy to purchase arms, and they can buy relatively new arms, which is what distinguishes Guangdong bandits from those in the interior, and requires greater patience and more methods in suppression.

　　In the early days of liberation, bandit activity in Guangdong was mainly in coastal cities and inland river routes, and there were generally no large-scale actions, as if they were lurking and observing, waiting for an opportunity to act. In February and March, especially after the enemy planes bombed Guangzhou on March 3rd and continued to bomb coastal cities such as Shantou and Jiangmen, bandit activity gradually moved from concealment to openness, from dispersion to gradual concentration, and from the periphery to infiltration into the interior. Combining with the reactionary armed forces in the countryside, they gathered into large groups, and secret agents who had fled to Hong Kong and Macau also sneaked back into the interior one after another, echoing each other, causing serious social unrest for a time. In March, there were a total of 102 bandit riots in the province, attacking our district and township government agencies, and looting warehouses and travelers. By the end of March, after we concentrated our forces to carry out suppression and implemented zonal encirclement and suppression, we suppressed the banditry. In April, a total of 25,000 bandits were annihilated, all the major bandit gangs were eliminated, and there are now estimated to be about 30,000 scattered bandits in the province, and their activities have been more restrained than before.

　　After entering the Guangdong mainland, we concentrated a large part of our forces to do urban takeover work. Guangdong's cities generally have a relatively weak industrial base and are more characterized by being semi-colonial than other cities. Almost in the Ming Dynasty, Guangdong already had a bureaucratic comprador class, that is, the so-called "Thirteen Hongs" of Guangzhou at that time, which were specialized in being compradors for foreign merchants. After the Opium War, with the deepening of imperialist aggression, a commercial system dependent on imperialism was established.

　　Therefore, this characteristic is probably more prominent in Guangdong, that is, commerce is particularly inflated and industry is particularly weak. For example, Guangzhou has a few relatively large-scale industries, but in fact there are not many. Shantou City has a population of 220,000, but only 90 factories employ more than 20 people. Zhanjiang City has a population of 200,000, but only 43 factories of various sizes. Therefore, at present when the national economy is undergoing major reorganization, the reorganization of the economy of some cities in Guangdong, and the pain before production that arises from this, will also be greater. In the past few months, many cities in Guangdong have been quite depressed, and unemployment has directly threatened both labor and capital. Some capitalists initially could not maintain their businesses, but they did not dare to propose adjustments or partial layoffs, and struggled to drag on, which was very difficult. Workers were afraid of unemployment, but they could not think of other ways to solve the problem. Some were fooled by the capitalists and asked the government to reduce taxes and debts, and spoke well for them. After the government adjusted, some factories and businesses partially laid off workers or implemented a shift work system, and wages that were too high were also appropriately reduced. The government allocated more than 1.2 million catties of grain for relief to unemployed workers, and some who could return to their hometowns to produce have already returned. At present, this problem has been relatively alleviated. As for the adjustment of the entire industry and commerce, we are still looking for ways according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In April, the second session of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Congress decided to establish a production committee to solve this matter.

　　In addition, in our understanding of urban work in the past few months, we feel that in order to prosper the urban and rural economy, in addition to attaching importance to and doing a good job in large and medium-sized cities, we should also attach importance to and do a good job in market towns between urban and rural areas. Market towns are the political, economic, and cultural centers in a certain rural area. On the one hand, they are closely linked to the countryside and control the countryside; on the other hand, they are connected to the cities. From the perspective of the urban system, they are the grassroots organizations of the city; from the perspective of the rural system, they are the superstructure of the surrounding villages. From the perspective of urban-rural relations, they are the link between urban and rural areas, and their position is very important. When we look at imperialist aggression against China, they all used control of market towns as a foothold for infiltrating the countryside. The fact that most market towns in many remote areas have churches is proof of this. The postal system's network throughout the country also uses market towns as its base. If you check the postal route map, almost all large, medium, and small cities and market towns in the country are equipped with post offices and police stations of different grades, which shows that it is impossible to contact cities without abandoning market towns. Therefore, at the provincial town work conference in March, we pointed out the necessity of doing a good job in market towns. The financial, economic, public security, and other departments have selected certain cadres to enrich the work in market towns, establish mass organizations, and establish financial, economic, taxation, trade, financial, and public security institutions to control the towns and realize the city's leadership over the countryside. The degree of implementation will be reported later.

　　In the countryside, in the early days of liberation, many cadres did not understand how to use the People's Representative Conference to carry out work, to contact and mobilize the masses, so some work could not get the support of the masses and fell into isolation. For example, in the collection of public grain, because there were few cadres and they lacked work experience, and the rural government was almost entirely still in the hands of the old Baojia personnel and landlords, who all had a set of reactionary experience, some deviations occurred. The main problem was that the burden was unevenly distributed, with landlords generally bearing very light burdens and farmers bearing slightly heavier burdens. But if the assistance of the masses is obtained through the People's Representative Conference, the burden is relatively fair, the task is completed quickly, and the awareness of the masses is also raised. For example, in the West River area, many counties and districts that completed the public grain task well were all obtained by holding the People's Representative Conference well. After the lessons of these facts, the leadership method of using the People's Representative Conference was gradually mastered by our cadres. At present, 63 of the 83 counties in the province's mainland have held People's Representative Conferences, and Guangzhou, Shantou, and Zhanjiang have also held them once or twice, generally with good results. The main thing is that the political awareness of the masses has been generally improved, so that they have a further understanding of the Communist Party and the People's Government. For example, when the People's Representatives Conference in the West River area discussed grain collection, the representatives said: If we had known that these major issues would be discussed, we could have brought a few more people. Because in their memory, these matters have always been manipulated by the Baojia chiefs, and the people have no right to speak. For example, some women in the West River area, after attending the People's Representative Conference, knew that the Communist Party was truly implementing democracy, and said, "I used to pray to gods and Buddhas, hoping that the Communist Party would leave quickly. I wrongly blamed good people." For example, when Zijin County held a meeting, they reviewed the past work. Because some work had not been done well, the county head felt sad while giving a painful self-criticism. The young man could not control his emotions for a while and shed a few tears. Some representatives also shed tears with him. After the meeting, they told people: "The Communist Party would not cry even if they were arrested and beheaded, but they shed tears when the work was done badly. They are indeed serving the people wholeheartedly."

　　In order to solve the difficulties of spring plowing and production, since the winter of last year, 46 counties in the province have all or partially implemented rent reduction and rent return. The government allocated more than 35.5 million catties of grain twice and requested the approval of the Central South Financial and Economic Commission to borrow part of the grain from the public grain balance. The three aspects cooperated to solve the problem, and basically overcame the spring famine, so that all arable land could be planted as scheduled. If there are no other disasters, this year's summer harvest will be no problem.

　　In terms of water conservancy, the flood season arrived a month earlier this year. In early May, the water levels of the rivers rose, but because we were prepared, the main dikes of the rivers were repaired in mid-April, completing a total of 2.2 million cubic meters of earthwork and 17,000 cubic meters of stonework. Eighty percent of the province's work of blocking breaches and restoring dikes has been completed. Therefore, the main dikes were fortunately not breached, but only a few branch dikes were breached due to the limitations of manpower and material resources, which could not be repaired in a hurry, or some farmland was flooded due to poor drainage. According to provincial statistics, about 130,000 mu of rice fields were flooded, which is less than the 800,000 mu destroyed by floods last year and the 1.5 million mu destroyed by floods the year before.

　　In addition, Chaozhou-Shantou and Xingmei, with a population of about 6 million, are preparing to carry out land reform after this autumn. We are now engaged in creating the conditions for land reform, such as rectifying the thinking of cadres, training peasant backbones, and conducting policy education and social surveys. Whether it can be implemented in the future depends on how well the preparations are made. We feel that the ideological style of cadres plays an important role in any work. Whether it is to strive for land reform after the autumn or to change other work, rectifying the style of cadres will be the starting point for doing a good job. In the future, we will seize this link to improve our work.

　　Guangdong is far from the central government, the situation is complex, and the cadres are weak. Please give us more instructions from the central government. [Xinhua News Agency, 2nd]

　　广东省工作报告
    （一九五零年六月二十七日在政务院第三十八次政务会议上的报告）
    广东省人民政府主席  叶剑英
    广东全境，有大陆，有海岛如东沙群岛区、西沙群岛区、中沙群岛区、南沙群岛、万山群岛等区。广东大陆，是去年十月十四日解放的，接着解放南澳，龟龄、三灶、涠洲等岛。海南岛是今年四月二十九日解放的。目前正在进行解放万山群岛斗争。其他海岛地区尚待解放中。但一般说来，广东全省，已算基本解放了。
    去年广东大陆解放后，因为海南岛还没有解放，全省九十九个县中，还有十六个县的二百多万人民，仍然呻吟在国民党反动统治之下。国民党的有组织的残余军事力量，还没有在广东境内被最后肃清，因此，广东大陆的治安和海面安全，尤其在群众心理上，多少还受些威胁。为了支援大军迅速消灭国民党残匪，使广东人民得以在和平环境中进行建设，所以前一个时期，我们是把支援海南岛作战作为重要任务的。这是一件繁重的工作。因为渡海，就必需有足够的船舶和熟习海性的船工，就必须建立一条由广州通到雷州半岛的漫长的补给线，建立起一个庞大的支前系统。人民解放军在进行这同一任务上，在中央军委与第四野战军首长的直接指挥下，更是表现出加倍的努力和创造性。他们不但日以继夜的进行海上训练克服各种困难，学习渡海登陆作战的全部技术，并且又对地方支前工作给予很多的帮助。使整个战争的胜利得以从前线到后方，完整组织起来。这些准备工作完成之后，由三月起，解放军就派出先头部队作试探性的潜渡，到了四月十七日开始大规模进攻，与冯白驹同志领导的海南岛人民游击队取得配合，击溃敌人的抵抗，二十三日解放海口，至二十九日解放榆林、三亚两港，完成海南全岛解放。现在海南的接收工作正在进行，各种机构正在建立。
    广东沿海及其海上岛屿，是处在国防的最前线。海岸线全长二千五百公里，沿海岛屿星罗棋布，如东沙、西沙、中沙、南沙等群岛，又距离海岸甚遥。所以广东的实际疆域是包括着宽阔海面的。保护这些海岛及沿海口岸，使不受帝国主义和国民党海盗所侵占，就不仅和保护我神圣领土有关，也直接对广东大陆的治安有关。在广东大陆，由于有着二千五百公里海岸线与许多河汊港口，并且又与香港、澳门、越南紧邻，土匪特务活动得到了许多有利条件，所以在解放初期至今年三月，土匪的活动曾是比较严重的。比方在内地各省区，只要土匪武装被解除了，它就很难再获得武装；而在广东，因为随时都可和海外，特别是香港、澳门取得联系，就很容易购买武装，而且能够买得比较新式的武装，这就是广东土匪之别于内地，在清剿上需要有更大耐心与更多办法的地方。
    解放初期，广东土匪的活动，基本是在沿海城市和内河航线上，一般还没有大规模的行动，似乎是在潜伏观察，伺隙而动。至二、三月间，特别在三月三日敌机对广州轰炸及继续轰炸汕头、江门等沿海城市之后，土匪活动就渐由隐蔽走上公开，由分散渐次集中，由边缘渗入内地。结合农村的反动武装，聚成大股，逃亡港澳的特务也纷纷潜回内地，互相呼应，曾一时造成社会秩序的严重不安。三月份全省土匪暴动，袭击我区乡政府机关，劫掠仓库行旅事件，共发生一百零二起。到三月底，经我们集中力量进行清剿，实行分区包打，才把匪风压下去。四月份统计共剿灭土匪二万五千人，把所有大股匪帮都消灭了，于今全省已无大股匪帮，零星散匪估计在三万人左右，活动也已较前敛迹。
    进入广东大陆之后，我们是集中了很大的一部分力量去做城市接管工作。广东的城市一般工业基础都比较薄弱，又比其他城市更加带着半殖民地的特性。差不多在明朝时候，广东就已有了官僚买办阶级，即是当时广州市的所谓“十三行”，是专为外商作买办的。鸦片战争之后，随着帝国主义侵略的日渐深刻，就建立起一套依赖帝国主义的商业系统。
    所以在广东这一特点恐怕更加突出，即是商业特别膨胀，而工业特别薄弱，如广州规模比较大一点的工业，其实就没有几家，汕头市有二十二万人口，雇用二十人以上的工厂，却只有九十家，湛江市有二十万人口，大小工厂却只有四十三家，因此在全国经济进行重大改组的现在，广东若干城市经济的改组，及由此而生的产前的痛苦，也就要大一些。在过去几个月中，广东许多城市都是相当萧条的，失业问题曾直接威胁到劳资双方面。资方起初有些是明明维持不下去，也不敢提出调整或部分解雇的要求，勉强拖下去，十分吃力。工人怕失业，但又想不出其他办法去解决，有的受了资方愚弄，替资方向政府要求减税减债，说好话。后经政府调整，有些工厂商业部分解雇了工人，或实行轮班工作制，工资过高的也适当减低，对于失业工人，政府曾拨一百二十万斤粮食进行救济，能回乡生产的，有的也已回乡，在目前这个问题是比较缓和点了。至于整个工商业的调整，还正在按照毛主席的指示，寻求办法。在四月间，广州市第二届人代会，已先决定成立一个生产委员会来解决这件事。
    另外，我们在几个月城市工作的理解中，觉得为了繁荣城乡经济，除了应该重视和做好大中城市的工作以外，还应该重视和做好介于城乡之间的圩镇工作，圩镇是在一定农村区域中的政治、经济、文化中心，它一面紧贴农村，掌握农村；一面又联络着城市。在城市系统看来，它是城市的基层组织；在农村系统看来，它是周围乡村的上层建筑。在城乡关系看来，它是联结城乡的纽带，其位置是很重要的。我们看一看帝国主义侵略中国，也都是以掌握圩镇作为渗入农村的落脚点，许多穷乡僻壤中间的圩镇之多半设有教堂就是明证。邮政系统之网络全国，也都以圩镇作其据点，试查邮政线路图，几乎全国各大中小城市及圩镇都分设有等级不同的邮局和派出所，可见放弃圩镇就无法联络城市。所以，在三月间的全省市镇工作会议上，我们指出做好圩镇工作的必要，财经公安各部门已选派一定干部去充实圩镇工作，建立群众团体，及财经、税收、贸易、金融、公安各种机构，把市镇控制起来，并由此实现城市对农村的领导。执行程度如何，容后再报。
    在农村，解放初期，许多干部还不懂得运用人民代表会议去进行工作，去联系与发动群众，所以有些工作就不能取得群众的支持，陷于孤立无助。例如在征收公粮中，因为干部少，而且没有工作经验，而乡村政权又几乎全部仍在旧保甲人员和地主手里，这些人都有一套反动经验的，以致发生过一些偏向。主要是负担畸轻畸重，地主普遍负担极轻，农民则稍嫌过重。但如运用人民代表会议取得群众的援助，负担就比较公平，任务也完成得快，并且也提高了群众的觉悟。如西江地区，许多公粮任务完成得较好的县区，就都是由开好人民代表会议获得的。经过这些事实的教训，运用人民代表会议的领导方法，才逐渐为我们的干部所掌握。于今全省大陆八十三个县中，开过人民代表会议的已有六十三个县，广州、汕头、湛江三市也开过一次或二次，一般都收到很好的效果。主要是普遍提高了群众的政治觉悟，使他们对共产党，对人民政府有了进一步的认识，如西江开人民代表会讨论征粮，代表们就说：早知道是讨论这些大事，我们可以多来几个人。因为在他们的记忆中，一向这些事都是由保甲长来操纵，人民是没有发言权的。又如西江有些妇女，开过人民代表会，知道共产党真正实行民主，都说，以前求神拜佛，希望共产党快点走，错怪了好人了。又如紫金县开会时，检讨到过去的工作，因为有些工作没有做好，县长在沉痛的自我批评中说着就难过起来，年青人一时情感控制不住了落了几滴眼泪，有些代表也陪着流泪，会后告诉人说：共产党抓去杀头都不哭，工作做坏了却下泪，的的确确是全心全意在替人民服务。
    为解决春耕生产的困难，自去年冬天起，全省有四十六个县都全部或一部实行过减租退租。政府又两次拨粮三千五百余万斤，并请得中南财委批准在公粮余额中借用一部粮食，三方面配合解决，基本上克服了春荒。使全部耕地都能如期下种，如无其他灾祸，今年夏收是没有问题的。
    在水利方面，今年汛期早到一月。五月上旬各江水位报涨，因为早有防备，在四月中旬，各江的主要堤围都曾修补，共完成二百二十万土方，一万七千石方。全省堵口复堤工作，做好了百分之八十。所以主要堤围皆幸未崩决，只少数分支堤坝，因人力物力限制，不能仓卒修复，曾有崩决，或因排水不良，也曾淹了一些田地，全省统计，被淹稻田约十三万亩，比之去年淹毁八十万亩，前年淹毁一百五十万亩，是少些了。
    此外，潮汕和兴梅，约六百万人口地区，准备在今年秋后进行土地改革。现正从事于土改条件的创造，如整顿干部思想，培养农民骨干及进行政策教育，社会调查等。将来能否实行，还须看准备如何而定。我们感到任何一件工作，干部的思想作风是起着重要作用的，不管为了争取秋后的土改，或是改变其他工作，整顿干部作风，都将是做好工作的起点，今后我们将抓住这一环节来改进我们的工作。
    广东地区远离中央，情况复杂，干部较弱，请中央多给我们以指示。【新华社二日讯】
