Xinhua News Agency, August 28th—Under pressure from the United States' "reduction of Marshall Plan aid appropriations," the Dutch and Belgian governments have followed in the footsteps of countries like Britain and France, agreeing to provide a portion of their troops to participate in the U.S. armed intervention in Korea. According to an Associated Press report from San Francisco: the director of the Dutch Information Bureau, Boerdelet, announced on the 23rd that two thousand Dutch infantrymen would be sent to Korea to participate in the war in the coming weeks. However, he said that how this detachment would be formed had not yet been decided. Furthermore, according to a United Press report citing a Belgian "official" source, the Belgian cabinet decided on the 25th to send one thousand soldiers to participate in the Korean War. It is claimed that this decision does not need to be approved by the Belgian parliament, but the organization and training of the troops will take two months, and transporting them to Korea will take another month.

    【新华社二十八日讯】在美国“削减马歇尔计划援助拨款”的压力下，荷兰与比利时政府已继英、法等国之后，答应出一部分军队，参加美国对朝鲜的武装干涉。据美联社旧金山讯：荷兰新闻局局长布尔德列二十三日宣布：二千荷兰步兵将于最近几周内赴朝鲜参战。但他说：这支分遣队究竟如何组成，尚未决定。又据合众社引比利时“官方”消息称：比内阁已于二十五日决定派兵一千名赴朝鲜参战。据称：此项决定无需经比议会批准，但军队的组织和训练需时两月，而把他们运到朝鲜又需时一月。
