　　Educating Cadres in the Spirit of Bolshevik Principles

Editor's Note: This article explains that the strength of the Bolsheviks lies in their correct principled policies, and the ideological nature and principles of their cadres. Therefore, Bolshevik principles require every Bolshevik to wage an irreconcilable struggle against any tendency to deviate from the Party's line, ideology, and policies, and from the Party's ideological and organizational principles; to wage an irreconcilable struggle against all phenomena that harm the interests of the Party, the government, and the people. Currently, rectification campaigns are being carried out in various parts of our country, and we are fighting against certain bad tendencies. Every Bolshevik should, starting from principles, conscientiously summarize work, boldly conduct criticism and self-criticism, correct mistakes, and do a good job.

　　The great founders and leaders of the Bolshevik Party, Lenin and Stalin, taught that a principled policy is the only correct policy. The strength of our Party lies in its correct principled policies, and the ideological nature and principles of its cadres, who have grown and been tempered in the struggle for the cause of communism.

　　Comrade Stalin instructed: In its work, the Party should be able to combine a high degree of principle with close contact and connection with the masses. Otherwise, the Party will not only be unable to teach the masses, but also unable to learn from them; not only unable to raise them to the level of the Party, but also unable to listen to the voices of the masses and understand their needs.

　　For Bolsheviks, principledness means that at all times and in all places, they must base themselves on the revolutionary theories of Lenin and Stalin, and use the policies of the Communist Party as the guide for all their work. For Bolsheviks, principledness means waging an irreconcilable struggle against everything and anything that deviates from the Party's line, ideology, and policies, from the Party's ideological and organizational principles, and against all phenomena that harm the interests of the Party, the government, and the people.

　　Bolshevik principledness means applying Lenin and Stalin's thought to practice, which is the guide to action for our Party and determines the actions of every communist. All the undertakings of the Party are subordinate to the struggle for communism, and to consolidating the strength of our motherland. Our Party has cultivated and educated many cadres who understand the Party's political line, are prepared to apply it to life, and are able to realize it in practice. Our cadres, all communists, in their work—large and small—proceed from the interests of the Party and the people. The Communist Party resolutely opposes all phenomena that serve factionalism, position, cliques, relatives, and friends, and violate the interests of the state and the people.

　　Principledness means that the interests of the Party, the Soviet state, and the people are above all else.

　　Our cadres, educated by the Bolsheviks, are worthy of the level of statesmen. In deciding matters of principle, they follow Comrade Stalin's instructions, namely, "Principles triumph and are irreconcilable because no compromise, concession, middle ground, or stopping halfway is allowed on matters of principle."

　　Loyal Bolsheviks not only verbally but also practically uphold the Party's resolutions, selflessly and at the cost of sacrifice, complete the Party's resolutions, and become models of observing the discipline of the Party and the government. Loyal to the cause of communism, resolutely realizing the great goals, and able to overcome all and any difficulties and obstacles—the great party of Lenin and Stalin constantly educates the Soviet people with such qualities.

　　A principled worker is strict with himself and with others. His courage and determination stem from his conviction in the righteousness of his demands, from his regarding the interests of the cause as above all else. Such a leader does not forgive those who make mistakes, is not afraid to hurt the self-esteem of those who harm the interests of the cause, and is not afraid to hide their shortcomings because of damaging relationships. Bolsheviks should help everyone who works sincerely, and at the same time resolutely oppose those who undermine our common cause.

　　Every staff member who trusts the Party and the government should always be a pure, faultless, and selfless person, so that he has not only the formal right, but also the moral right to strictly demand others.

　　As for replacing principledness with kinship in work, the actual work of the leaders of the Artemov City Party Committee in the Primorsky Krai is an example. The secretary of the municipal party committee, Comrade Demitriuk, in order to satisfy kinship and "Artemovskiy Ugol" Trust management Comrade Bazhenov for a long time suppressed serious errors and shortcomings in the trust's work, concealed them, and did not want to "disturb his friends." Due to the lack of principledness on the part of the Party leaders, the shortcomings in the trust's work were not eliminated, but were suppressed, and deepened and expanded. This unsatisfactory fact was subjected to just and sharp criticism from the Communist Party members.

　　It is well known that our Party attaches great importance to the selection of good cadres. Here, Bolshevik principledness is even more important. However, the Nikolaev City Party Committee acted contrary to this. The staff of the municipal party committee did not pay attention to the selection of cadres. The municipal party committee, without understanding his business and political qualities, sent Comrade Mazur, a party member, to be the director of a factory in the city. Due to the waste of materials, Mazur was soon dismissed and punished by law. The two comrades, municipal party committee secretaries Ryukov and Gurov, decided to protect this incompetent operator from punishment and reappointed him to leadership work, but Mazur messed things up here as well.

　　Such facts can only exist where there is a lack of criticism and self-criticism, and the Party's work lacks Bolshevik principles. Without criticism and self-criticism, there can be no proper education of cadres. The most important condition for educating our cadres in the spirit of principledness and high ideological level is to boldly develop criticism and self-criticism.

　　The principledness of a staff member is manifested in his ability to carry out any undertaking to the end and to fulfill his oath. If you receive such and such a task, then you must complete it no matter what! Sometimes, when completing a task, you will encounter great difficulties, but it is in the struggle against difficulties that a staff member's principledness can be tested. A true Bolshevik does not bow to difficulties, but thinks of ways to overcome them and achieve the set goal.

　　A high degree of principledness requires those who work on the ideological front to wage an irreconcilable struggle against hostile bourgeois consciousness and phenomena such as lack of ideology, lack of concern for politics, flattery, and cosmopolitanism. Our scientific cadres, literary and art workers, following the resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues, should resolutely implement the Bolshevik unwavering Party principles, and consistently develop and enrich our Soviet socialist culture—the most advanced and most ideological culture in the world.

　　The great thought of Lenin and Stalin illuminates all the undertakings of our Party. Communists who have mastered Marxist-Leninist theory can correctly handle any problem. That is why, when educating cadres in the spirit of a high degree of principledness, we should first complete and further develop the Party's educational undertakings, the study of Marxism-Leninism, and the Bolshevik training of our people, to raise their theoretical level.

### 以布尔塞维克原则性的精神教育干部

　　以布尔塞维克原则性的精神教育干部
    编者按：这篇文章说明了布尔塞维克之所以有力量，就在于它的正确的原则性的政策，及其干部的思想性和原则性。因此布尔塞维克的原则性，对每一个布尔塞维克的要求：要和任何脱离党的路线，脱离党的思想和政策，脱离党的思想原则和组织原则的倾向作不调和的斗争，同一切损害党、政府、人民利益的现象作不调和的斗争。现在我国各地正在进行整风，正在和某些不良倾向作斗争。每个布尔塞维克应该从原则性出发，认真总结工作，大胆地展开批评和自我批评，改正错误，作好工作。
    布尔塞维克党的伟大创始人和领袖列宁和斯大林教导说：原则性的政策是唯一正确的政策。我们党的力量就在于它的正确的原则性的政策，及其干部的思想性和原则性，这些干部是在为共产主义事业的斗争中生长和锻炼出来的。
    斯大林同志指示道：党在其工作中，应当会把高度的原则性和与群众密切联系及接触相结合起来。否则党就不仅不能教导群众，而且也不能够向他们学习；不仅不能够提高他们到党的水平，而且也不能够倾听群众的呼声，了解他们的需要。
    原则性对于布尔塞维克来说，就是要随时随地依据列宁斯大林的革命学说，以共产党的政策作为自己全部工作指南。原则性对于布尔塞维克来说，就是要和一切和任何脱离党的路线、脱离党的思想和政策、脱离党的思想原则和组织原则的倾向作不调和的斗争，同一切损害党、政府、人民利益的现象作不调和的斗争。
    布尔塞维克的原则性，就是说要把列宁斯大林思想应用到实际中去，这种思想是我们党的行动指南，它决定着每一个共产主义者的行动。党的全部事业是服从于共产主义斗争的，服从于巩固我们祖国的力量的。我们党培养了并且教育了很多干部，这些干部了解党的政治路线，并准备将它应用到生活中去，而且能够在实际中实现它。我们的干部，一切的共产主义者，在自己的事业中——大的和小的——都是从党的人民的利益出发的。共产党坚决反对一切效劳于派别、地位、集团、亲友等关系的违反国家人民利益的现象。
    原则性就是说党的、苏维埃国家的和人民的利益高于一切。
    布尔塞维克所教育出来的我们的干部是够得上政治家的水平的。在决定原则问题时，他们遵循着斯大林同志的指示，即“原则之所以战胜和不调和是因为在原则性质的问题上不容许有妥协、让步、中间路线和止于中途的。”
    忠实布尔塞维克的原则不仅在字面上，而且在实际中维护党的决议，忘我地，不惜牺牲地去完成党的决议，成为遵守党的政府的纪律的模范。忠实共产主义事业，坚决实现伟大的目标，能够克服一切和任何困难和障碍——伟大的列宁斯大林党经常拿这样的品质教育苏维埃人民。
    有原则性的工作者是严格要求自己和别人的。他的勇气和决心是出自于对自己正义的要求的确信，出自于他把事业的利益看作高于一切。这样的领导者，他不宽恕犯错误的人，他不怕伤害那些损害事业利益的人的自尊心，他不怕因为伤害关系而隐藏他们的缺点。布尔塞维克应当帮助每一个诚恳工作的人，同时应当坚决反对那些破坏我们共同事业的人。
    每一个信任党和政府的工作人员，应当经常是一个纯洁、无过、大公无私的人，使得不仅有形式上的权利，而且有道义上的权利去严格要求别人。
    至于说到在工作中以亲友关系代替原则性，那末滨海区阿尔怯莫夫市党委的领导者的实际工作即是一个例子。市委书记得米特留克同志为满足于亲戚关系和“阿尔怯莫高里”托辣斯管理巴赞列依同志长期地把托辣斯工作中的严重错误和缺点压下不谈，隐瞒起来，不愿“使自己的朋友不安”。由于党的领导者缺乏原则性，托辣斯工作中的缺点没有去掉，而被压下去了，而且加深了和扩大了。这种不能令人满意的实事，受到了共产党员正义的和尖锐的批评。
    众所周知，我们党对选择好的干部是极其重视的，在这里，布尔塞维克的原则性就更为重要。但是尼古拉也夫市党委却相反。市委工作人员对挑选干部不注意。对党员马租尔同志，市委不了解他的业务和政治品质，就派他作市内的一个工厂厂长。由于浪费了器材，马租尔很快就被撤职了，而且受到法律制裁。市委书记如可夫和古罗夫两同志决定维护这个不称职的经营者不受惩罚而又从新委任他作领导工作，但就在这里马租尔也把事情搞糟了。
    这样的事实只能在缺乏批评与自我批评，党内工作缺乏布尔塞维克原则的地方才有其存在的余地。没有批评与自我批评就不能有干部的正当教育。以原则性和高度思想性教育我们干部的最重要的条件就是要大胆的展开批评与自我批评。
    工作人员的原则性表现在他能够把任何事业贯彻始终，能够履行誓言。假若你接到这样一个或那样一个任务，那么你无论如何要完成它！有时候，在完成一件任务时，要遇到很大的困难，但是，就在同困难作斗争里，一个工作人员的原则性才能够得到考验。真正的布尔塞维克不是向困难低头，而是想方法去克服它，达到所定之目标。
    高度的原则性要求思想战线上的工作者，同敌对的资产阶级意识及无思想、不关心政治、阿谀、世界主义等现象进行不调和的斗争。我们的科学干部、文学艺术工作者，遵循着联共（布）中央对思想问题的决议，应当坚决贯彻布尔塞维克坚定不移的党的原则，始终不渝的发展并丰富我们苏维埃社会主义的文化——世界上最先进的最有思想的文化。
    伟大的列宁斯大林的思想照亮了我党的全部事业。掌握了马列主义理论的共产主义者，对任何问题都能正确处理。这就是为什么在以高度原则性精神教育干部时，应首先完成并向前发展党的教育事业，马列主义的学习以及我国人民布尔塞维克的锻炼，提高他们理论水平的原因。
