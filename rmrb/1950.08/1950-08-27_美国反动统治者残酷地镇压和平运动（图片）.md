American Reactionary Rulers Cruelly Suppress the Peace Movement

    Photo captions:
    In early August, American workers held demonstrations everywhere to oppose the war of aggression. The mad reactionaries adopted Hitler-style brutal methods in an attempt to suppress them. These are a few photos sent by airmail from the American Worker's Daily:
    ① At 5 p.m., tens of thousands of American workers rushed from factories to the vicinity of Union Square in New York. At 5:45 p.m., they crossed the street to the square, began to march, and shouted the slogan "We want peace!" The police rushed into the ranks like tigers and wolves, beating and arresting people indiscriminately.
    ② The police knocked this demonstrator to the ground, kicking him indiscriminately. The person being beaten held onto his glasses tightly with one hand, afraid of them being broken. Women were also forcibly dragged to the center of the street to be beaten, but they struggled to run back to the ranks and continue the peace demonstration.
    ③ The heroic sailor McCarthy, after being prevented by the police from raising his banner, climbed up a lamppost and stood there for more than an hour, unfurling his banner to thousands of people. The police finally pulled him to the ground and beat him with fists and feet.
    ④ Peace fighter McCarthy is now recovering at Beekman Hospital, one of his eyes having been damaged.
    ⑤ An African-American worker is being taken to a police car by plainclothes detectives. The two detectives each wear yellow-headed pins on their left lapels to allow the police to identify them. Another worker is also being dragged onto a police car, with a detective sitting on top of him. (News Photography Bureau)

    美国反动统治者残酷地镇压和平运动
    照片说明
    八月上旬，美国工人为了反对侵略战争到处举行示威游行。疯狂的反动派采取了希特勒式的残暴方法企图镇压。这是美国工人日报由航邮寄来的几张照片：
    ①下午五时，成千成万的美国工人从工厂冲到纽约联合广场的周围，到五时四十五分他们跨过街心到广场上，开始游行，并喊着“我们要和平”的口号，警察就像虎狼一般冲进队伍，乱打乱抓。
    ②警察把这个游行者击倒地上，用脚乱踢，被打的人一只手紧紧地拿着他的眼镜，怕给打破了。妇女们也同样给强拉到街道中心来殴打，但他们奋力跑回队伍里，继续举行和平示威游行。
    ③英勇的海员麦加锡在被警察阻止不得举起他的标语之后，他就爬上电灯杆，矗立一个钟头以上，向成千的群众展开他的标语。警察终于把他拉倒在地上，加以拳打脚踢。
    ④和平斗士麦加锡现在比克门医院疗养，他的一只眼睛已被打坏。
    ⑤一个黑人工人给便衣密探拘上警车，两个密探左襟上各佩黄头别针，以便使警察识别。另外一个工人同样给拖上警车，一个密探坐在他的身上。  （新闻摄影局）
