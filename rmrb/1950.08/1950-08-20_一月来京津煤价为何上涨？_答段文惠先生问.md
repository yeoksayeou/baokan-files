　　Why Did Coal Prices in Beijing and Tianjin Rise in January?
　　An Answer to Mr. Duan Wenhui
　　Mr. Duan Wenhui:
　　Regarding your letter asking about the reasons for the rise in coal prices in Beijing and Tianjin over the past month, we have requested the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company (hereinafter referred to as "Coal Building Company") to answer as follows:
　　Since July, continuous rainfall, reaching 897 millimeters in the Mentougou mining area by August 4th, has caused continuous flooding of the mine shafts, greatly reducing coal production. Some coal merchants, lacking understanding of the overall situation, saw the flooding and reduced production, and believed that a coal shortage would inevitably occur this winter, so they rushed to buy and hoard coal, even buying coal in the heavy rain. Due to the speculative activities of these coal merchants, they fueled the panic of ordinary citizens and businesses; fearing a coal shortage this winter, they also rushed to buy coal. This is the main reason for the recent rise in coal prices.
　　In order to ensure the supply of fuel coal this winter and to curb the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants, we have adopted a planned supply and distribution method. We supply various government agencies, troops, schools, and cooperatives in stages according to their reported coal demand budgets; we supply citizens according to their actual needs; and we provide appropriate supplies to coal merchants according to their actual sales and processing capabilities.
　　After the flooding of mine shafts in the Mentougou mining area, the coal production in that area will inevitably be affected somewhat. However, Beijing and Tianjin will absolutely not experience a coal shortage as a result. The mine shafts that have not been flooded are continuing production, and active efforts are being organized to drain the flooded mine shafts.
　　According to investigations, the demand for Mentougou coal in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding areas and along the Beijing-Tianjin and Beijing-Baoding railway lines from August to December is more than 500,000 tons. However, based on the current situation, it is estimated that the entire mining area can produce approximately 200,000 tons of coal from August to December. The Beijing and Tianjin branches of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company currently have 230,000 tons of Mentougou coal in stock, the coal mines and Mentougou area coal yards have 55,000 tons of coal in stock, and Beijing coal merchants have approximately 15,000 tons of coal in stock, providing a total supply capacity of more than 500,000 tons. In addition, the company plans to transport 100,000 to 150,000 tons of Yangquan coal (anthracite), 50,000 tons of Datong coal, and a temporary allocation of 10,000 tons of Jiaozuo coal, starting in August. Kailing coal and Xiayuan coal can be transferred in unlimited quantities. Therefore, although the Mentougou mine has experienced flooding and reduced production, other fuel coals can fully supply Beijing and Tianjin. However, government agencies, troops, organizations, schools, enterprises, factories, and citizens who use Mentougou coal should switch to or increase the use of cheaper Yangquan coal, Datong coal, Kailing coal, and Xiayuan coal, in order to reduce the demand for Mentougou coal and assist the state-owned company in stabilizing Mentougou coal prices.
　　Before July, Mentougou coal was in the off-season for coal sales, with high production and low sales, resulting in a surplus of production. At the same time, because the selling price was lower than the cost, the Coal Building Company suffered long-term losses. From January to May, the average loss was 20.8 catties of rice per ton, and in June, the loss was as high as 41 catties of rice per ton. In July, due to flooding and reduced production, the cost slightly increased, and the Coal Building Company's list price was also slightly increased due to the fact that coal prices had already risen. This is beneficial in preventing speculation, reversing the unreasonable Mentougou coal prices of the past, correcting long-term losses, and stimulating users to burn other types of coal to reduce Mentougou coal sales, preserving Mentougou coal strength, to await the peak coal demand months to fully supply coal to all sectors (the price of Mentougou coal has been appropriately increased, while the price of Yangquan mixed coal has been appropriately reduced).
　　In short, this rise in Mentougou coal prices is due to unexpected reasons and is fundamentally different from the price fluctuations before March. The state-owned Coal Building Company controls a large amount of coal reserves and has the power to guarantee the supply of coal for Beijing and Tianjin this winter and stabilize coal prices.

### 一月来京津煤价为何上涨？  答段文惠先生问

　　一月来京津煤价为何上涨？
    答段文惠先生问
　　段文惠先生：
    你来信问这一个月来，北京、天津煤价上涨的原因，我们已请中国煤业建筑器材公司（以下简称“煤建公司”）解答如下：
    七月以来不断下雨，至八月四日门头沟矿区降雨量已达八百九十七公厘，矿窑连续被淹，煤产量大大减少。某些不明大义的煤商，看到淹窑减产，认为今冬必会发生煤荒，遂抢购囤积，甚至有的冒着大雨买煤。由于这一些煤商的投机活动，就助长了一般市民商户的恐慌心理；惟恐今冬发生煤荒，亦争先购煤。这就是最近煤价上涨的主要原因。
    为了保证今冬燃煤供应，制止奸商投机倒把，我们采用了有计划的供应分配办法。对各机关、部队、学校、合作社，按所报需煤预算分期供给；对市民按其真实需用量供给；对煤商则按其真实推销与加工能力，予以适当供给。
    门头沟矿区发生淹窑后，该区煤产当然要受些影响。但京津两地绝不会因此而发生煤荒。现矿区未淹矿窑仍继续生产，已淹矿窑正积极组织力量排水。
    据调查，京、津、保地区及京津、京保铁路沿线八至十二月份需用门煤量为五十余万吨，但根据现在情况估计，整个矿区生产八至十二月份可产煤二十万吨左右；京津两煤业建筑器材分公司现存门煤二十三万余吨，煤矿矿场及门头沟区煤栈存煤五万五千吨，京市煤商存煤约在一万五千吨以上，共有五十万余吨的供应力量。另外，公司准备自八月开始，调运阳泉煤（无烟煤）十万至十五万吨，大同煤五万吨，焦作煤暂调一万吨，开滦煤、下花园煤可以无限量的调入。因之，门矿虽淹窑减产，其他燃煤是可以充分供给京津两地的。不过，燃用门头沟煤的机关、部队、团体、学校、企业、工厂和市民，应改烧或多烧价格较低廉的阳泉煤、大同煤、开滦煤、下花园煤，以减少门煤之需用量，协助国营公司稳定门煤价格。
    门头沟煤在七月份以前处于销煤淡月，产量多而销售少，形成生产过剩的现象。同时因售价低于成本，煤建公司长期赔累。一至五月，每吨平均赔米二十点八斤，六月每吨竟赔米四十一斤。七月份因为淹窑减产，成本略有提高，以及煤价已经上涨的事实，煤建公司牌价也略有提高。这在杜绝投机，扭转以往门煤价格之不合理，纠正长期赔本，并刺激用户燃用其他煤种减少门煤销量，保存门煤实力，以待需煤旺月充分供给各界用煤是有好处的（门煤价格进行了适当上提，而阳泉混煤价格则已适当降低）。
    总之，此次门煤价格上涨，是因意外原因，与三月以前的物价波动是有本质上的区别。国营煤建公司掌握了大批存煤，有力量保证供应今冬京津两地用煤与稳定煤价。      编者
