    X. Work Becomes Tense

    Everyone wasn't used to frequent meetings, and it became even more troublesome as time went on, so the meetings were always a bit lax. Representative Song told the old hero to be flexible and pay attention to everyone's emotions, but the old hero found it very difficult, a hundred times harder than driving a locomotive.

    Despite this, the things everyone agreed on at the meeting were implemented one by one.

    The new uphill method and fuel saving measures were put into practice, and work became tense.

    Especially when the old hero took over the shift (he was still in the same shift as Zheng Dugong and Zhang Chuanzhong), he kept on instructing them.

    Before starting the locomotive, he said:

    "The fire bed shouldn't be too thick, nor too thin!"

    When the locomotive started moving, he said again:

    "Old Zheng, don't add large chunks of coal, it's hard to burn and wasteful, break it up."

    After speaking to Zheng Dugong, he said to Zhang Chuanzhong:

    "Old Zhang, sprinkle some water on those coal fines, otherwise they'll all fall through."

    As soon as the locomotive arrived at the station, even if it was just a ten-minute stop, he would quickly say:

    "Old Zhang, close all the ash box baffles (Note 1), just open two before driving."

    After speaking to Old Zhang, he said to Old Zheng:

    "Old Zheng, quickly shut off the throttle."

    He took care of everything from all sides, not letting anyone be idle.

    Zheng Dugong felt extremely annoyed.

    As the locomotive approached Harbin, the old hero again asked them to pick out the stone coal and take it back to the section, so they could exchange it for good coal.

    Zheng Dugong frowned and said:

    "It's better to make do than be too particular, let's just manage, who has that much strength?"

    The old hero smiled and said:

    "There's a bonus for this."

    Zheng Dugong said:

    "I'm not going to get rich from those few bonuses!"

    The old hero drooped his head and said nothing.

    Although Zheng Dugong said that, he still picked out the stone coal, but the old hero didn't see it.

    The locomotive was speeding along, his head drooping, until Zhang Chuanzhong reminded him that the locomotive was about to enter the station, then he raised his head to control the air brake.

    After handing over the shift, Zhang Chuanzhong and Zheng Dugong walked home shoulder to shoulder.

    Zhang Chuanzhong said:

    "Old Zheng, you're really unkind, they say don't hit a man in the face, knowing that the old hero values money, you still say that, making him lose face."

    Zheng Dugong said:

    "You're talking nonsense! If what I said was wrong, why didn't you say so?"

    Zhang Chuanzhong originally also disliked the old hero's fussiness, and he was happy that Zheng Dugong contradicted the old hero. But Zheng Dugong didn't understand this, and instead started scolding him, so he said unhappily:

    "Who's talking nonsense? You're talking nonsense! What you said was incorrect!"

    "The Communist Party practices democracy and tells everyone to speak, how is that incorrect?"

    "Getting a bonus is for responsibility! Is it just for getting rich?"

    "Then is responsibility just for getting a bonus?"

    "No one said responsibility is just for getting a bonus!"

    Zheng Dugong was still arguing, so Zhang Chuanzhong ignored him and they went their separate ways.

    The old hero also returned home very unhappily. There were more than ten people in the whole family, more eating than working. The old and the young surrounded the dining table, and the one room was a bit cramped.

    He picked up his rice bowl and was still thinking:

    "Do I want to get rich? If I don't earn money, how will this family live?"

    The more he thought about it, the less he could eat. He put down his bowl and went back to the section.

    Note 1: Used for ventilation in the fire chamber, pulling it open will make the fire burn hotter. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）

    十、工作紧张起来
    大家不习惯常开会，时间一长就更麻烦，因此开会总有点松松散散。宋代表告诉老英雄要灵活，要注意掌握大家情绪，但老英雄感到很困难，比开车难百倍。
    尽管如此，会上大家同意的事情都一件件照着办了。
    新上坡法和省煤省油都实行了，工作紧张起来。
    特别是老英雄一接班（他还是和郑笃恭、张传忠一班）就更加不住嘴的嘱咐。
    开车前他说：
    “火床别太厚，也别太薄！”
    车走起来，他又说：
    “老郑，别把大块煤往里添，又不好烧又浪费，砸碎吧。”
    对郑笃恭说了又对张传忠说：
    “老张，把那碎渣子煤烧上点水吧，要不就都漏下去了。”
    车一到站，只要停十分钟，他赶紧又说：
    “老张把灰箱挡板（注一）都挡死吧，开车前拉开两个就行了。”
    对老张说了又对老郑说：
    “老郑，快把油门关住。”
    他四方八面都照顾到，不让一个人闲着。
    郑笃恭感到烦的不行了。
    车快到哈尔滨，老英雄又叫把石头煤拣出来带回段上去，好顶数换回好煤来。
    郑笃恭眉头一绉说道：
    “讲究不如将就，凑合点子吧，谁有那么大劲？”
    老英雄笑着说：
    “这可是有奖金哪。”
    郑笃恭说：
    “我不指那几个奖金发财！”
    老英雄搭拉下脑袋不说话了。
    郑笃恭虽然嘴里那么说，还是把石头煤拣了出来，可是老英雄没看见。
    车在飞跑，他的脑袋搭拉着，直等张传忠提醒他车快进站了，他才抬起头来去掌握风闸。
    交了班，张传忠和郑笃恭肩并肩地往家走。
    张传忠说：
    “老郑，你真缺德，常说打人别打脸，明知道老英雄把钱看的重，你偏那么说，叫人家下不了台。”
    郑笃恭道：
    “你草蛋！我说得不对，你为什么不说？”
    张传忠原是也嫌老英雄噜苏，郑笃恭顶老英雄，他也高兴。可是郑笃恭没了解这意思，反而骂开自己了，因此很不痛快的说道：
    “谁草蛋？你草蛋！你说得就是不正确！”
    “共产党实行民主叫大伙说话，怎么不正确？”
    “得奖是为负责制！那是为发财哪？”
    “那末负责制光为了得奖哪？”
    “谁也没说负责制光为了得奖！”
    郑笃恭还胡吵，张传忠就没有再理他，各走各的了。
    老英雄也是很不痛快的回到家里，全家十多口人吃饭的多，干活的少。老的小的围了一饭桌，一间房子有点转腾不开。
    他端起饭碗还在想：
    “我想发财？我不挣钱，这一家人怎么活？”
    越想越吃不下饭，把碗一撂，又回段上去了。
    注一：火室内通风用的，拉开后火就会旺起来。（附图片）
