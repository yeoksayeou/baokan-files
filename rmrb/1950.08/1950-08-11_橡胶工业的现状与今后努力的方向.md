　　I
　　The rubber industry in China has a history of thirty years. After several ups and downs, it has evolved to the point where there are now 543 factories nationwide (including a few handicraft workshops) with over 34,000 employees, possessing a considerable production capacity. This is a rapidly developing, but also somewhat weak and pathological, emerging national industry.
　　The rubber industry has several characteristics: First, the variety of rubber products is complex and their uses are extensive, ranging from tires for transportation, rubber belts, rollers, water pipes, and gas pipes for industrial and mining use, to rubber shoes and raincoats for daily consumption, as well as medical, hygiene, cultural, educational, and sports supplies. A rough estimate of the existing products of the domestic rubber industry shows that there are already over 200 kinds, and they are increasing day by day to meet the needs of various sectors. Second, the rubber industry is a comprehensive chemical industry. The manufacture of certain products (such as automobile and airplane tires) requires complex machinery and relatively high production technology, while the equipment and technology required for general daily consumer goods (such as rubber shoes and stationery) are simpler, thus creating conditions for the breeding and growth of small factories and even handicraft workshops. Third, although the raw materials of the rubber industry mostly rely on imports, the price of the main raw material, raw rubber, used to be relatively low, so its proportion in the production cost was not large (according to statistics from May of this year, when rubber prices had already risen, raw rubber accounted for less than 20 percent of the cost of cloth-faced rubber shoes in Shanghai factories, and only about 14 percent of the cost of rickshaw tires). The proportion of direct labor in the cost is also small (direct labor accounts for less than 10 percent of the total cost of products such as rubber shoes and tires). Various costs are quite flexible depending on technology, labor conditions, ingredients, and quality, making it easy for manufacturers to obtain substantial profits. Fourth, rubber industrial products include certain military supplies, such as rubber shoes, for which there are often large orders. In the past, the targets and timing of orders were not very balanced, often concentrated in a certain time and place, stimulating the "blind" expansion of the rubber industry in that time and place. After the completion of orders, it tended to shrink.
　　Due to these characteristics, the rubber industry has conditions for rapid and vigorous development when the objective environment is favorable. For example, before the Anti-Japanese War, there were only 22 rubber factories in Shanghai, with 5,541 employees, 159 rubber mixing mills, and a monthly rubber milling capacity of 763.2 tons. Although production and sales declined and large factories were shut down during the Anti-Japanese War, small factories emerged in response to the times, and the number of factories increased to 33, with 191 rubber mixing mills and a monthly rubber milling capacity of 916.8 tons, while the number of employees decreased to 2,885. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, stimulated by the Kuomintang's low foreign exchange policy, the number of factories suddenly increased to 103, with 15,704 employees, 495 rubber mixing mills, and a monthly rubber milling capacity increased to 2,077 tons. After liberation, although faced with difficulties such as the naval blockade, bandit air raids, and market contraction, the number of factories, equipment, and production capacity continued to increase. By May 1950, the number of factories had increased to 175, with 528 rubber mixing mills and a maximum monthly rubber milling capacity of 2,534.96 tons, while the number of employees decreased to 13,276.
　　After liberation, the center of gravity of the rubber industry gradually shifted northward. If the period after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War was the golden age of the Shanghai rubber industry, then the period after liberation was the golden age of the Tianjin and Northeast rubber industries. In 1949 alone, private rubber factories in Tianjin added 33 new factories, restored 8 old factories, and increased the number of workers by 667. (There are currently 86 public and private rubber factories with 4,382 employees, 271 rubber mixing mills, and a monthly rubber milling capacity of 1,103 tons). Output also increased month by month. In the year from March 1949 to March 1950, Tianjin rubber factories produced a total of 3.95 million pairs of rubber shoes and 592,000 bicycle tires, while in the entire year of 1947, they only produced 700,000 pairs of rubber shoes and 238,400 bicycle tires.
　　During the period of Japanese occupation, the Northeast rubber industry had only over 30 factories (21 of which were in Shenyang), all operated by the Japanese. It was not until after August 15th that more than 10 privately-run factories with rubber mixing mill equipment were opened, but their business was difficult and they could only operate for four months each year. After the liberation of Northeast China, the demand for rubber products increased sharply and the source of raw materials was relatively smooth. New factories were added one after another, and by June 1949, it had increased to more than 70 factories. After the autumn of 1949, new factories sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. As of May 1950, Shenyang alone had reached 265 factories (including 11 state-owned factories and 254 private factories). However, except for state-owned factories, private factories were very small in scale, and 70 percent were handicraft industries.
　　The vigorous development of the rubber industry in North China and Northeast China after liberation was the result of the restoration of transportation, the construction of industrial and mining enterprises, and the increase in rural purchasing power after the land reform, which expanded the market. In the past, the rubber industry was concentrated in Shanghai, but now it is gradually distributed to these important industrial cities, which is a reasonable development trend. However, too rapid development also carries a strong speculative and blind nature, expanding unnecessary equipment and creating an overcapacity in the production of certain products (especially rubber shoes, bicycle tires, and other easily manufactured products). Moreover, most of the new factories have weak capital, simple equipment, and low technology, and some even use coal stoves and gasoline drums as vulcanizers, resulting in poor quality and durability, which not only wastes raw materials and loses reputation, but also squeezes each other. Once they encounter setbacks, they cannot support themselves. For example, most of the more than 200 private rubber shoe factories in Shenyang have recently been shut down due to cost-cutting sales that did not cover costs.
　　The rubber factories in Chongqing also blindly expanded equipment and hired workers a few months ago due to receiving a large number of orders from the military region. As a result, after the orders were completed, they were in a difficult situation of overcapacity and unable to dispose of it.
　　Based on the above situation, it can be seen that the development of the rubber industry in various places in the past was abnormal and unbalanced. In terms of geographical distribution, all rubber factories in the country are concentrated in six or seven coastal cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, accounting for more than 95 percent. In terms of factory scale, most are small. In terms of product nature, most are mainly consumer goods. Except for state-owned factories that manufacture more transportation and mining products, private factories are mostly concentrated in the production of daily necessities. For example, in 1949, rubber shoes accounted for 74 percent of the total output value of state-owned and private rubber factories nationwide, bicycle tires accounted for 20.5 percent, and other products only accounted for 5.5 percent. Rubber raw materials used to manufacture shoes account for more than 70 percent of the total consumption of raw rubber. The focus of the rubber industry in the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States is on tire manufacturing, while in our country, only five factories can manufacture automobile tires, and their equipment is mainly small-sized, which does not meet actual needs and needs to be improved.

　　II
　　Since the past development of China's rubber industry contained many weaknesses and pathologies, today it will inevitably encounter some difficulties. The main difficulties at present are market and raw material issues.
　　The problem with the market is the contradiction that purchasing power cannot adapt to production capacity. The huge production capacity caused by unplanned expansion in the past is particularly evident in several consumer goods products. According to recent statistics, the maximum production capacity of rubber shoes nationwide reaches more than 12 million pairs per month, while the average monthly output in 1949 was only 4 million pairs, and it is estimated that the average monthly demand in the next year will not exceed 5 million pairs; that is to say, two-thirds of the equipment for manufacturing rubber shoes cannot be used at present. The production capacity of bicycle tires nationwide reaches more than 646,000 per month, and the average monthly output in 1949 was only 297,000. It is estimated that the recent average monthly demand will not exceed 300,000; more than half of the equipment is also temporarily unusable. Even in terms of industrial and mining transportation transmission belts and automobile tires, except for the higher productivity in Northeast China, Tianjin, and Qingdao, Shanghai is also affected by sluggish sales. At present, there is a general phenomenon of oversupply of rubber products nationwide, sluggish sales, and the resulting inability to carry out normal production, which makes the rubber industry in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing particularly difficult. For example, rubber factories in Shanghai can often only use about 30% of their maximum production capacity. Their maximum monthly rubber milling capacity is 2,534.96 tons. In fact, the average monthly consumption of raw rubber in 1948, the year with the highest consumption of raw rubber, was 1,038 tons, 650 tons in 1949, and only 603 tons on average from January to May this year. Although it increased to 743 tons in May, it only accounted for 29.3% of the total rubber milling capacity, which is about 70% of the raw rubber consumption in 1948, and the ability to utilize the production capacity to this extent is mainly maintained by government orders.
　　The imbalance between production capacity and sales is followed by phenomena such as excess equipment and labor, reduced production and shutdowns, difficulty in capital turnover, and increased production costs or partial losses. This is the biggest difficulty felt by the rubber industry in most regions at present.
　　Another major difficulty is the supply and price of raw materials. Cheap raw rubber raw materials were one of the favorable conditions that stimulated the abnormal development of the rubber industry in the past, but China's rubber materials and chemical ingredients have always relied on foreign imports. This year, due to the monopoly and purchase of rubber markets in Southeast Asian producing areas by British and American imperialists, the supply cannot meet the demand. In April, the market price of No. 3 smoked rubber rose from 66 cents per pound in Straits currency, and by early August, it had risen to more than 1.20 Straits dollars, so domestic market prices also followed suit. The market prices of other chemical ingredients such as carbon black, zinc oxide, and accelerators have also risen, and their sources are not smooth. This directly increases manufacturing costs; the market prices of rubber products, however, cannot rise in proportion to costs due to restrictions on sluggish sales. But even so, recent market price fluctuations in rubber products still exceed general prices. The high prices, in turn, weaken purchasing power, making the product market even more sluggish. Therefore, the continuous rise in the price of rubber raw materials has formed a serious threat to the national rubber industry.

　　III
　　The inability to supply the main raw materials ourselves is the most fundamental weakness and difficulty of China's rubber industry. Raw rubber and some chemical ingredients completely rely on imports, which not only consumes huge amounts of foreign exchange in peacetime, but also has the risk of supply interruption when the international situation is tense. Therefore, we must adopt various methods to overcome this difficulty under the principle of self-reliance.
　　Among the raw materials of the rubber industry, some can already be produced domestically, and the rest have the conditions to produce themselves. For example, chemical ingredients such as sulfur, zinc oxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and paraffin wax can now be self-sufficient; carbon black accelerators and anti-aging agents can also be self-made, but quality aspects need further efforts. There is a small amount of raw rubber produced in Hainan Island, and there is also hope for cultivating rubber grass in Xinjiang. China is rich in resources for synthetic rubber (grain, natural gas, etc.). In the future, we should simultaneously promote the cultivation of natural rubber (Brazilian rubber trees in Hainan Island and Indian banyan trees in the southwest), the promotion of rubber-containing herbaceous and vine plants (Qingjiao dandelion in Xinjiang, Daluye deerhorn fruit and Niaotou fruit in the southwest), and the manufacture of synthetic rubber. These tasks are all long-term and arduous tasks, but as long as we do them conscientiously and vigorously, we can achieve results within a certain period of time. Before rubber materials can be completely self-sufficient, we should try our best to use all available domestic raw materials, and at the same time, we should try our best to save imported raw materials, such as using waste rubber to manufacture reclaimed rubber, banning the manufacture of transparent rubber products, and reducing the rubber content of daily consumer goods, which are all necessary measures.
　　To meet the needs of national defense and the development of industry, mining, and agriculture, public and private rubber factories should focus on and step-by-step develop the manufacture of means of production in the future. For example, expanding large-scale automobile tire equipment, manufacturing airplane and industrial and mining rubber belts and rubber pipes, etc. We should also coordinate with the needs of medical and health, cultural and educational sports, etc. and substitute foreign goods. At the same time, we should actively improve quality and reduce costs. For the production of daily necessities such as rubber shoes, we should strive for low prices and good quality, and strive for popularization to open up a vast rural market.
　　According to the current raw material supply situation and the needs of transportation, industrial and mining construction, and daily necessities in the next one or two years, the rubber industry can only adopt the general maintenance, focused consolidation and restoration, restriction of blind expansion, and gradually move towards the production policy of planned production. To avoid blind production and achieve a balance between production and sales, we must guide the rubber industry in various places to carry out planned production. At this National Rubber Industry Conference, a realistic estimate was made of the demand for various major rubber products, and a production plan for each region of the country was formulated and handed over to the rubber industry in various places for implementation. Although this plan is still a preliminary and not very accurate outline, it has a significant role in guiding production, reducing waste, regulating the production and sales relations in various regions, avoiding mutual squeezing, and promoting the rubber industry towards planned production.
　　In terms of public-private relations, the rubber industry needs to achieve division of labor and cooperation, unified ordering, market regulation, and reasonable pricing under the leadership of the state-owned economy. Public and private factories should also exchange experiences and disclose technologies to improve quality, save raw materials, achieve streamlining, cost reduction, and improve the business management and technical level of the entire rubber industry. In terms of business methods, general private factories, especially small and medium-sized factories, should abandon the past speculation and reliance, strive for legitimate business, and try their best to adopt joint purchase of raw materials, joint sales of finished products, and division of labor and joint production, using collective power to solve problems and improve management.
　　The above are the policies that the rubber industry must implement to overcome difficulties and steadily prepare for future development. With the recovery and progress of national economic construction, the demand for various rubber products will inevitably increase day by day. The future development of China's rubber industry is exceptionally broad. But we must not forget that the main raw materials of the rubber industry still rely on foreign imports, and all prosperity and development lack reliable conditions. In the future, only by striving to get rid of dependence on imperialist economies, striving for complete self-sufficiency of main raw materials, and at the same time striving to transform enterprise management and improve technical standards, can our rubber industry have a solid foundation for steady forward development.
　　In summary, gradually achieving self-sufficiency in raw materials and planned production in the near future is the current way out and direction of efforts for China's rubber industry.

　　橡胶工业的现状与今后努力的方向
　　季崇威
    一
    橡胶工业在中国已有三十年的历史，几经兴衰，演变到现在，全国已有五百四十三家工厂（包括少数手工生产工场），三万四千余名职工，拥有相当大的生产能力，这是一个发展迅速，但却带着若干弱点和病态的新兴民族工业。
    橡胶工业有几个特点：第一、橡胶制品的种类繁复，用途广大，从交通用的轮胎、工矿用的胶带、滚筒、水管、气管，到日常消费用的胶鞋、雨衣，以至医疗卫生、文教体育用品，到处都是它服务的范围。拿国内橡胶工业现有的制品来说，粗略统计，即达二百余种，而且正配合着各方面的需要，一天天增加着。第二、橡胶工业是综合性的化学工业，其中若干产品（如汽车、飞机的轮胎）的制造需要复杂的机器设备和比较高度的生产技术，但一般的日常消费用品（如胶鞋、文具等）所需的设备和技术却较简易，因此造成了若干小型工厂甚至手工作坊孕育滋长的条件。第三、橡胶工业的原料虽大部仰赖国外输入，但因过去主要原料生橡胶的价格比较低廉，所以在生产成品中所占比率不大（根据胶价业已上涨的本年五月间的统计，上海工厂布面胶鞋成本中，生胶所占比率不到百分之二十，力车外胎更仅占百分之十四左右）。直接工资在成本中所占比率亦小（胶鞋、车胎等制品直接工资在成本总额中所占比率均在百分之十以下）。各项成本根据技术、劳动条件及配料、品质的不同，伸缩性颇大，制造厂家易于获得丰厚的利润。第四、橡胶工业制品中，包括若干军用品如胶鞋等，常有大量定货，过去定货的对象和时间不甚均衡，往往集中于某时某地，而刺激了当时当地的橡胶工业“盲目”扩张。订货完成后又趋于萎缩。
    由于这些特点，所以形成了橡胶工业在客观环境顺利时易于迅速蓬勃发展的条件。例如上海橡胶工业抗战前仅有二十二家，职工人数五、五四一人，碾胶机一五九部，每月轧胶能力为七六三·二吨。抗战期中虽产销衰退，大厂停顿，但小厂应时而起，厂数反增为三十三户，碾胶机为一九一台，每月轧胶能力为九一六·八吨，而职工人数则减为二、八八五人。抗战胜利后，因国民党低价外汇政策的刺激，家数突增至一○三户，职工人数一五、七○四人，碾胶机四九五台，轧胶能力每月增至二、○七七吨。解放后虽然遭受海口封锁、匪机轰炸、市场减缩等困难，但厂数设备及生产能力还是续有增加，到一九五○年五月止，厂数增到一七五户，碾胶机五二八部，每月最高轧胶能力达二、五三四·九六吨，职工人数则减为一三、二七六人。
    解放后橡胶工业的发展重心渐向北移。如果说抗战胜利后一个阶段是上海橡胶工业的黄金时代，则解放后一个阶段却是天津和东北橡胶工业的黄金时代了。天津私营橡胶工厂在一九四九年一年中增设了三十三个新厂，恢复了八个旧厂，增加了工人六六七人。（现有公私营橡胶工厂八十六家，职工四、三八二名，碾胶机二七一台，每月轧胶能力一、一○三吨）。产量也逐月增加，在一九四九年三月到一九五○年三月一年中，天津各橡胶厂共产胶鞋三百九十五万双，自由车外胎五十九万二千条，而一九四七年全年仅产胶鞋七○万双，自由车外胎二十三万八千四百余条。
    东北橡胶工业在沦陷时期仅有三十余厂（内二十一厂在沈阳），都为日人经营，直到八·一五后，才开设了有碾胶机设备的民营工厂十余家，但业务困难，每年只能开工四个月。东北解放后，橡胶制品需要激增，原料来源较畅，新厂陆续添设，一九四九年六月已增至七十余家，一九四九年秋后新厂更似雨后春笋，迄一九五○年五月，仅沈阳一地，已达二六五家（内国营十一厂，私营二五四厂），但除国营厂外，私营厂规模甚小，百分之七十都是手工业。
    华北东北橡胶工业解放后的蓬勃发展是由于交通恢复，工矿修建及土改后农村购买力提高，市场扩大的结果。过去橡胶工业集中上海，现渐分布到这些重要工业城市，这是一种合理的发展趋向。但发展太快，也就带着浓厚的投机性和盲目性，扩充不必要的设备，造成若干产品（特别是胶鞋，力车胎等易于制造的产品）生产能力的过剩。且新厂大都资金薄弱，设备简陋，技术低下，甚至有以煤球炉，汽油桶充硫化器的，以致制品质劣不能耐用，不仅浪费原料，堕失信誉，而且自相挤轧，一遇挫折，即无法支持，如沈阳二百余家私营制胶鞋工厂，最近就因削价竞销，不敷成本而大部停顿。
    重庆的橡胶厂，数月前亦因接到军区的大量定货而盲目扩充设备，招添工人，结果定货做完，即陷于生产能力过剩，无法处置的窘境。
    根据以上情况，可以看出：过去各地橡胶工业的发展是不正常不平衡的。在地域的分布上，全国所有橡胶工厂，都集中在上海、天津、青岛、广州、沈阳等六七个沿海都市，其比重占到百分之九十五以上。工厂的规模，大部分是小型的。产品性质，多以消费的生活资料为主，除国营厂制造交通工矿用品较多外，私营厂大半集中在日用品的生产上，如一九四九年全国国私营橡胶厂生产总值中，胶鞋一项即占百分之七四，力车胎占百分之二○·五，其他制品只占百分之五·五。应用于制造鞋类的橡胶原料，要占到生胶消耗总额的百分之七十以上。苏联和英美等国橡胶工业的重心都置于轮胎的制造，而我国则迄今仅有五家工厂能制汽车轮胎，其设备且以小型尺寸的为主，不合实际需要，尚待改进。
    二
    中国橡胶工业过去的发展既然孕含着许多弱点和病态，今天也就必然会遭遇若干的困难，目前主要的困难是市场和原料问题。
    市场方面的问题是购买力无法与生产能力相适应的矛盾。由于过去无计划扩充而造成的庞大生产能力，在几种消费资料的产品上表现得特别明显，据最近统计：全国胶鞋的最高生产能力每月共达一千二百余万双，而一九四九年的平均月产量不过四百万双，估计今后一年内平均的月需量亦不会超过五百万双；那就是说：有三分之二制造胶鞋的设备目前不能利用。全国力车外胎的生产能力月达六十四万六千余条，一九四九年平均月产量只有二十九万七千余条，估计最近平均月需量，不会超过三十万条；亦有一半以上的设备暂时不能利用。即以工矿运输传动胶带和汽车轮胎论，除东北、津、青生产率较高外，上海方面亦因滞销影响生产。目前一般橡胶制品在全国范围内还存在着供过于求的现象，销路呆滞，影响所及，生产无法正常进行，这使上海、广州、重庆几个地区的橡胶工业，特别觉得困难。如上海的橡胶厂就经常只能利用其最大生产能力的三成左右，其每月最高轧胶能力是二、五三四·九六吨，实际上消耗生胶量最高的一年一九四八年平均每月为一、○三八吨，一九四九年平均每月为六五○吨，今年一至五月则平均仅耗六○三吨，五月份虽增至七四三吨，亦仅占全部轧胶能力的二九·三％，约合一九四八年生胶消耗量的七成，而生产能力能利用到这个程度，主要还是由于政府定货来维持的。
    产能与销量的不平衡，跟着就引起设备和劳动力的过剩，减产停工，资金不易周转，生产成本增高或部分亏蚀等现象，这是目前多数地区橡胶工业所感到的最大困难。
    另一个重大的困难是原料的供应与价格问题。廉价的生橡胶原料本是过去刺激橡胶工业畸形发展的有利条件之一，但中国胶料及化学配料向赖国外输入，本年南洋产地胶市因英美帝国主义的垄断搜购，供不应求，四月间三号烟胶每磅市价从叻币六角六分节节上涨，到八月初已涨达叻币一元二角多，因此国内市价亦跟随上涨。其他化学配料如碳黑，锌气粉，促进剂等市价亦有上涨，且来源不畅。这就直接增加了制造成本；而橡胶制品的市价，则因受滞销的限制无法按成本比例上升。但即使如此，橡胶制品最近的市价波动仍超过一般物价，价格的昂贵，转而削弱购买力，使制品市场更为萎缩。所以目前橡胶原料价格的不断上涨，已形成对全国橡胶工业严重的威胁。
    三
    主要原料的不能自给，是当前中国橡胶工业最基本的弱点和困难，生橡胶及一部分化学配料完全依赖进口，不仅平时须消耗巨额外汇，在国际局势紧张时，来源供应更有中断之虞。所以我们必须在自力更生的原则下，采取各种办法来克服这一困难。
    在橡胶工业原料中，有一部分国内已能生产，其余亦都具有能自行生产的条件，如化学配料的硫黄，氧化锌，碳酸钙，碳酸镁，石腊等现在已可自给；碳黑促进剂，防老剂等亦能自制，但质量方面尚待进一步的努力。生橡胶在海南岛有少量出产，新疆的橡胶草亦有培植希望，人造橡胶的资源（粮食天然气等）中国很丰富。今后应该在培植天然橡胶（海南岛的巴西胶树及西南的印度榕树），推广含胶草本藤本植物（新疆的青胶蒲公英，西南的大叶鹿角果，鸟头果等）及人造橡胶的制造等多方面分头并进。这几件工作都是长期的艰巨的任务，但只要我们切实大力去做，在一定时间内是可以收到成绩的。在胶料未能做到完全自给之前，我们一方面应该尽量采用一切可以使用的国产原料，同时更要尽量设法节约进口原料，如利用废旧橡胶制造再生胶，禁制透明胶质的用品，减低日用消费品的含胶量等，这都是必要的措施。
    为配合国防需要和工矿、农业的发展，今后公私营橡胶厂应有重点有步骤地向生产资料的制造发展。例如，扩充大型汽车轮胎设备，制造飞机及工矿用胶带、胶管等，对医疗卫生、文教体育等用品，亦应配合需要，替代外货；同时并从提高质量降低成本上积极改进。对胶鞋等日用品的生产，则应做到价廉物美，力求大众化，以开辟广大的农村市场。
    根据目前原料供应的情况，及最近一、二年内交通、工矿建设和民生日用等方面的需要，橡胶工业现在还只能采取一般的维持，重点的整理恢复，限制盲目扩充，逐步走向计划生产的生产方针。为避免盲目生产，达到产销平衡的目的，必须引导各地橡胶工业进行有计划的生产。在这次全国橡胶工业会议中，已对各种主要橡胶制品的需要量作了切实的估计，订定全国各区的生产计划，分交各地橡胶工业执行，这一计划虽然还是初步的，不太精确的轮廓，但它在指导生产，减少浪费，调节各地区产销关系，避免互相挤轧，以及推动橡胶工业走向计划生产等任务上，却具有重大的作用。
    在公私关系上，橡胶工业需要在国营经济领导下，做到分工合作，统一定货，调剂市场，合理订价。公私营各厂间更要交流经验，公开技术，以改进品质，节省原物料，做到精简节约降低成本，提高整个橡胶工业的企业经营和技术水平。在经营方法上，一般私营工厂，特别是中小型厂，要摒弃过去的投机性，依赖性，努力于正当业务，并尽量采取联购原料，联销成品，分工联制等联营方式，用集体力量来解决问题，改善经营。
    以上是橡胶工业为克服困难，稳步地准备将来的发展，所必须实施的方针。随着国家经济建设的恢复进展，今后各种橡胶制品的需要必将与日俱增，中国橡胶工业发展的前途是异常宽广的。但我们不能忘记，橡胶工业主要的原料迄今仍依赖国外进口，一切的繁荣和发展都缺乏可靠的条件；今后唯有努力摆脱对帝国主义经济的依赖，争取主要原料的完全自给，同时要努力于企业经营的改造与技术水准的提高，我们的橡胶工业才能具备稳步向前发展的坚实基础。
    概括地说：在最近期间逐步做到原料自给与计划生产，这就是中国橡胶工业当前的出路和努力方向。
