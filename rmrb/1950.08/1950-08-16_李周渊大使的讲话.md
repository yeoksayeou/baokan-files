Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The full text of the speech by Li Zhouyuan, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to our country, at the reception celebrating the fifth anniversary of the liberation of Korea is as follows:
	Distinguished guests! Comrades!
	Today is the fifth anniversary of the Korean people's "August 15th" Liberation Day. I would like to express my deep gratitude to everyone who has come to this celebration tonight.
	The great Soviet army liberated the Korean people from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism on August 15, 1945, and warmly helped the Korean people in the cause of building an independent and democratic country. After liberation, under the leadership of our national leader, General Kim Il-sung, the Korean people implemented democratic elections and various democratic reforms and people's economic plans in the northern half, achieving many results. As a result, the people's patriotic enthusiasm and their material and cultural life have rapidly improved and developed, thus establishing an economic and defense foundation for the independence and unification of the motherland.
	At the same time, the victory of the great Chinese people encouraged the Korean people to unify their motherland with their own strength.
	On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of liberation, we would like to pay our deepest respects to the Soviet army and its leader, Marshal Stalin, and express our deepest gratitude to the great neighboring Chinese people for their great help to the Korean people.
	However, in the southern half of our republic, the US imperialists have actively implemented a conspiracy to turn our Korea into its colony. The US imperialists instigated pro-Japanese elements and the traitor Syngman Rhee to shamelessly suppress patriotic democratic parties and social organizations, implement inhumane policies of exploitation and massacre against the people, massacred countless patriotic people, and more actively and consistently carried out the conspiracy to provoke a civil war of internecine strife.
	The US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang have consistently rejected the call of the entire Korean people for the peaceful unification of the motherland, and on the orders of Washington, they suddenly invaded the area north of the 38th parallel on June 25 this year. Our Republic's People's Army could no longer tolerate this bestial invasion and began to fight back.
	Since the start of the counterattack, our heroic People's Army has wiped out most of the Syngman Rhee bandit army in just a few days. As a result, US imperialism directly mobilized a considerable amount of force to invade our territory. However, the heroic Korean People's Army resolutely eliminated many American aggressors and has victoriously advanced to the vicinity of Busan and Jinhae. In order to cover up their failure on the front lines, the barbaric US imperialists carried out barbaric bombings of peaceful cities and farmers, and also carried out naval artillery fire on the coast, not only destroying many cultural facilities, but also massacring peaceful residents and women and children.
	The entire Korean people, in order not to be colonial slaves again, are bravely advancing to eliminate the enemy, regardless of any sacrifice, and will surely drive the enemies into the sea and achieve final victory in the near future.
	The Korean people deeply thank the fraternal support of the people of the world's peace-loving countries, led by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
	I hope everyone will raise a glass to the health of Marshal Stalin, the benefactor of our national liberation and the mentor of the world's peace-loving people, and to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of our neighboring People's Republic of China.

　　李周渊大使的讲话
    【新华社十五日讯】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使李周渊在庆祝朝鲜解放五周年纪念的招待会上的讲话全文如下：各位来宾！各位同志们！
    今天是我们朝鲜人民“八、一五”解放第五周年纪念日。我谨向特别来参加今天的庆祝晚会的各位，深表感谢。
    伟大的苏联军队在一九四五年八月十五日把朝鲜人民从日本帝国主义殖民地统治下解放出来，并热诚地帮助了朝鲜人民创建独立的民主主义国家的事业。解放后朝鲜人民在我们民族的领袖金日成将军的领导下，在北半部实行了民主选举和各种民主改革及人民经济计划，获得了不少成果，因而，人民的爱国热忱与他们的物质文化生活，很迅速地提高与发展，这样才建立了为祖国的独立和统一的经济的和国防的基础。
    同时，伟大的中国人民的胜利鼓舞了朝鲜人民以自己的力量统一自己祖国。
    值此解放五周年之际，我们谨向苏联军队及其领导者斯大林大元帅致深深的敬意，并谨向伟大的邻邦中国人民对朝鲜人民的很大的帮助致深深的感谢。
    然而，美帝国主义者在我们共和国南半部却积极地实行了把我们朝鲜变为它的殖民地的阴谋。美帝国主义策动了亲日派和李承晚卖国贼无耻地弹压了爱国的各民主政党和社会团体，对人民实施了惨无人道的压榨和屠杀政策，屠杀了无数的爱国人民，并更积极地一贯地进行了挑拨同族相争的内战的阴谋。
    美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮一贯拒绝了全朝鲜人民的和平统一祖国的号召，而奉华盛顿方面的命令，竟于今年六月二十五日突然地侵犯了三八线以北地区。我们共和国人民军队不能再忍受这种野兽的侵犯，就开始应战反击了。
    我们英勇的人民军自从开始反击后，不到几天内，就消灭了李承晚匪军的大部分。于是，美帝国主义直接动员了不少的武力侵略我们疆土。可是英勇的朝鲜人民军坚决消灭了不少的美军强盗，已胜利地挺进到釜山、镇海附近去了。野蛮的美帝国主义为了掩盖其在前线的失败，对和平的城市和农民进行野蛮的轰炸，对海岸也实行舰炮射击，不仅破坏了很多的文化设施，而且屠杀和平居民和妇孺。
    全朝鲜人民为了不再做殖民地奴隶，不顾任何牺牲，为消灭敌人而勇敢前进着，不久的将来，一定把敌人们驱逐到海里面去，取得最后胜利。
    朝鲜人民对以苏联与中华人民共和国为首的世界爱好和平国家人民的兄弟的声援，深致感谢。
    我希望各位为了我们民族的解放恩人、世界爱好和平人民的导师斯大林大元帅健康，为了我们的邻邦中华人民共和国人民的伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的健康，请干一杯。
