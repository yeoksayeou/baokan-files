　　Security Council Continues Discussion of Agenda
　　Malik Points Out That the U.S. Representative's Proposal to "Change the Agenda" Violates Security Council Rules and Practices
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] TASS, New York, August 3rd: On August 2nd, the Security Council, chaired by Soviet representative Malik, convened a meeting to continue discussing the adoption of the agenda. There were two proposals submitted to the Security Council for discussion: one from the Soviet delegation, requesting that the issue of recognizing the representative of the Chinese People's Government as the legitimate representative of China be listed as the first item on the agenda, and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue as the second; the other was from the US delegation, requesting that the Security Council not discuss the above two issues, but rather discuss the US proposal, which, as is well known, is against North Korea.
　　Malik announced the opening of the meeting and asked whether the Council members were willing to discuss the three proposed agenda items simultaneously, or separately. Malik then said that the Soviet delegation favored discussing each issue separately.
　　British representative Jebb delivered a lengthy speech supporting the US representative Austin's attitude toward the agenda. Like Austin's speech on August 1st, Jebb asserted that the issue of China's representation in the United Nations was irrelevant to the Korean issue, and therefore the US proposal on the Korean issue should have priority.
　　Malik declared that Jebb had not answered the question he had raised.
　　The representative of Ecuador announced that he would vote against including the two issues proposed by the Soviet Union on the agenda.
　　Subsequently, Cuban representative Alvarez and French representative Chauvel, with undue enthusiasm, supported the suggestion of US representative Austin.
　　Norwegian representative Sunde stated in his speech that the government he represented agreed to allow the representative of the Chinese People's Government to participate in the Security Council, as long as it could be achieved in an "organized manner." Regarding the agenda issue, he also supported the US representative's suggestion.
　　Austin also spoke, formally suggesting changing the temporary agenda proposed by the Soviet representative, placing the US proposal first. Austin cited the Security Council's rules of procedure, demanding priority consideration of his suggestion.
　　Malik immediately rose to speak, pointing out that Austin's "change" proposal to the temporary agenda was in violation of the Security Council's rules and practices, and said that Austin was attempting to usurp the authority of the Security Council President. Malik further emphasized that while Security Council members could make suggestions to include various issues in the temporary agenda proposed by the President, Austin's "change the agenda" motion aimed to completely cancel the temporary agenda proposed by the President and replace it with another agenda. Malik pointed out that the Security Council must abide by its rules and practices, and vote on the various agendas in the order in which they were proposed, that is, first vote on the two proposals made by the Soviet Union, and then vote on the one proposal made by the United States. When discussing the US proposal, Malik said that the US motion talked about "localizing" the Korean War, but under "localization," the war was actually becoming more intense and deeper. Malik said that on the other hand, the Soviet Union was willing to work for peace and seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.
　　Malik finally reiterated his request that the Security Council adhere to the correct procedure and vote on the proposed agendas in the order in which they were submitted. The meeting adjourned after Malik's speech. The meeting is scheduled to reconvene on August 3rd.

　　安理会继续讨论议程
    马立克指出美代表所提“变更议程”案违反安理会规则和惯例
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社纽约三日讯：八月二日，安全理事会由苏联代表马立克担任主席召开会议，继续讨论通过议程的问题。提交安全理事会讨论的建议有两个：一个是苏联代表团的建议，要求把承认中国人民政府的代表为中国合法代表问题列为议程第一项，把和平解决朝鲜问题列为第二项；另一个是美国代表团的建议，要求安理会不要讨论上述两个问题，而讨论美国的提案，如所周知，这提案是反对北朝鲜的。
    马立克宣布会议开始，并询问理事会各理事国是否愿意同时讨论被提议列入议程的三个问题，或者愿意分别加以讨论。马立克接着说，苏联代表团赞成每个问题分别讨论。
    英国代表杰伯发表长篇演说，支持美国代表奥斯汀对议程所持的态度。像奥斯汀在八月一日的发言那样，杰伯断言，中国在联合国的代表权问题与朝鲜问题无关，因此，美国提出的关于朝鲜问题的提案应该享有优先权。
    马立克宣称，杰伯并没有回答他所提出的问题。
    厄瓜多尔代表宣布，他将投票反对把苏联提出的两个问题列入议程。
    接着，古巴代表阿尔渥里兹和法国代表萧维尔都以不适当的热心支持美国代表奥斯汀的建议。
    挪威代表森德在发言时附带保证，他所代表的政府赞成让中国人民政府的代表参加安理会，只要能以“有组织的方式”达成。关于议程问题，他也支持美国代表的建议。
    奥斯汀也发言，他正式建议改变苏联代表所提出的临时议程，把美国的提案列为首位。奥斯汀援引安理会的议事规则，要求优先讨论他的建议。
    马立克随即起立发言，指出：奥斯汀所提临时议程的“变更”案，是违反安理会的规则和惯例的，并且说：奥斯汀是试图篡夺安理会主席的职权。马立克进而着重指出：安理会会员固然可以提出建议，在主席所提临时议程内列入各种不同问题，但奥斯汀所提的“变更议程”议案，目的是要完全取消主席所提临时议程，而代之以另一议程。马立克指出：安理会必须遵守其规则和惯例，按着各项议程所提出的先后次序予以表决，即：先表决苏联所提两项议案。其次再表决美国的一项议案。马立克论及美国所提议案时称：美国的动议中谈到朝鲜战争的“地方化”，但是，在“地方化”之下，战事其实是更趋激烈，更趋深刻。马立克说：在另一方面，苏联则愿意致力于和平，并求朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    马立克最后再次要求安理会遵守正确程序，按照提出的先后顺序，表决所提出的各种议程。马立克发言后即散会。会议定于八月三日再开。
