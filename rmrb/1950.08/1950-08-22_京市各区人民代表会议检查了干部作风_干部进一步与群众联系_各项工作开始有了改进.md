The Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conferences Inspect Cadre Work Style; Cadres Further Connect with the Masses; Various Tasks Begin to See Improvement

[This Newspaper's Report] Beijing's district-level People's Representative Conferences have now been universally convened. From the end of May to mid-July, the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Districts have successively held People's Representative Conferences from all walks of life to inspect the ideological work style of cadres and to examine the work of district-level departments. This has enabled the work style of cadres in these districts to begin to improve rapidly, correcting many shortcomings in the work of each district. After the meetings, each district immediately implemented the various resolutions of the conference seriously, according to their urgency and importance. The masses in each district expressed satisfaction. The masses generally reflected: "This is truly being the masters of our own affairs." For example, in the Seventh District, the Deputy District Head of the District Office and a section chief from the Public Security Sub-bureau personally visited residents to solicit opinions, responding to their opinions individually. The masses were very moved after hearing this, saying: "The government cares about us so much and has such a good attitude that we dare to express any opinions we have in the future." They also expressed their willingness to assist the government in promoting work. After the Fifth District meeting, the Tax Sub-bureau reviewed its work, and staff members proactively sought opinions from industrial and commercial households to improve their work. Police officers from the police stations also voluntarily sought opinions from the masses.

After holding representative conferences, each district quickly and seriously implemented the various resolutions of the conference. Because the Sixth and Seventh District People's Representative Conferences were held in early June, more of their motions have been implemented. The First and Fifth Districts have not been meeting for long, and most of the motions are being prepared for implementation. However, the implementation of resolutions in each district has been very good, and many achievements have been made.

In the implementation of the conference resolutions, the masses in each district have automatically organized themselves to participate in work. In particular, the working people have displayed the greatest enthusiasm, doing their best to assist the government in completing necessary municipal construction. They have contributed the most to the three tasks of housing repair, road repair, and cleaning up street hygiene. In order to specifically lead the work, each district has successively established housing repair and hygiene committees, and some districts have also established road repair committees in the streets and alleys that need repair.

Regarding housing repair:

District cadres first conducted a detailed survey with the police stations, and separately convened symposiums for landlords and tenants, deeply explaining the urban housing policy. After reaching an agreement between the landlords and tenants, they began repairs. By the end of July, the Sixth District had repaired 1,101 houses, which played a significant role in preventing house collapses during the rainy season. Of the 1,815 houses in the Seventh District that needed repair, 431 had been repaired by the end of July, and 742 were under construction or preparing for repairs. In July, after heavy rains, house collapses occurred in each district. The District Head of the Seventh District led cadres to rescue disaster victims in the pouring rain, and no major unfortunate events occurred. Each district also launched relief efforts, distributing relief grain to poor households whose houses had collapsed.

Regarding hygiene construction:

Under the leadership of the District Hygiene Committee, widespread publicity and mobilization work was carried out, and a summer hygiene campaign was launched. Generally speaking, the streets and alleys are now cleaner than before. For example, the Beishuiguan, Houheyan, and Shangtangzi areas of the Seventh District are much cleaner than before, and the hygiene of large factories and public primary schools in each district is also gradually improving. Each district has successively launched epidemic prevention work. In the First District, more than 39,000 people have been vaccinated against epidemics; in the Fifth District, 69,403 people have been vaccinated; in the Sixth District, 31,543 people have been vaccinated (accounting for one-fifth of the district's population); and in the Seventh District, 51,518 people have been vaccinated. Some districts have also carried out other tasks, such as establishing workers' clinics, inspecting cold food and ordinary food shops or vendors, removing mosquito larvae, catching flies, carrying out indoor and outdoor cleaning, and removing garbage. The masses generally reflected: We must strive to live in fresh air forever.

Most or nearly all of the work to convert open ditches to covered ditches and dredging projects in each district has been completed. In particular, the waterlogged area of Paozi River in the First District, which had been under construction since June 6, guided the dirty and stagnant water of more than 30 years out of the city through covered ditches in less than two months. More than 500 households near the area were overjoyed and thanked the People's Government. On the first day after the Seventh District representative meeting, the Zuo'anmen Water Gate was repaired and opened. The masses said: "Only the people's government can do this."

In addition, each district established main water pipes for tap water and set up tap water supply stations. The Seventh District established 28 stations and renovated 16 private water wells. The Fifth District is currently working on three stations. Previously, it cost 100 yuan per load to drink water from private wells, but now it costs 50 yuan per load to drink water from tap water stations. The masses are very satisfied. Each district is also discussing with the Beijing Electric Power Bureau to install more street lights. The Seventh District has repaired 86 street lights. Each district has also built or is preparing to build some public toilets and sewage pools.

Regarding road repair:

Under the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, road repair committees have been organized in each street and alley. The masses have actively participated in road repair work. The Sixth District has completed the government-funded repairs of Hufang Bridge, Guanyin Temple, Xizhushikou, and Xiliushujing streets. The joint public-private repairs of Muchang Hutong, Chongzhen Temple, and Xinglong Street have been completed. More than 200 teachers and students (70% of whom were women) from the adult education schools in the Sixth District participated in road repairs on August 11. In an hour and a half, they completed 150 meters of dirt road. The Seventh District has repaired 12 roads, about 6,180 square meters. 2,600 people participated in road repair. Residents of Mile Alley and West Fahua Temple Street in the district brought their own shovels, picks, and other tools to participate in road repairs from 7 to 9 pm every day. The 30-meter-long and 10-meter-wide road was completed in three days, and they were sometimes reluctant to rest until 10 pm.

Regarding culture and education:

Each district is preparing to improve the organization of spare-time schools, add workers' night schools, and consolidate adult education schools. Each district has successively established or increased children's literacy classes. The Seventh District has established six classes, the Fifth District six classes, and the Sixth District seventeen classes. The Seventh District has also established a half-day school at Tianlong Temple in Chongwai Dongsikuaixue. Other plans include establishing reading rooms, morning schools, and women's literacy classes in some districts.

In carrying out these tasks, the district offices listened to the opinions of the masses and district representatives at any time. Many district representatives also reflected the opinions of the masses at any time. This close connection between the district-level government and the masses greatly helped in completing and improving the work. Undoubtedly, the district representative conferences have greatly improved the work of the district-level government.

　　京市各区人民代表会议检查了干部作风
    干部进一步与群众联系
    各项工作开始有了改进
    【本报讯】北京市区各界人民代表会议现已普遍召开。自五月底至七月中旬，已有第一、第五、第六、第七等四个区先后召开了各界人民代表会议，检查了干部的思想作风，检查了区级各部门的工作，这就使各该区干部的工作作风开始迅速地有了改进，纠正了各该区工作中的许多缺点。各区于会后立即分别轻重缓急认真执行大会的各项决议。各区群众都表示满意。群众普遍反映：“这真是当家作主了。”如第七区由区公所副区长和公安分局某科长亲自走访提意见的居民，分别答复他们的意见，群众听了以后都很感动地说：“政府对我们这样关心，态度又好，以后有什么意见都敢说了。”并表示：愿意协助政府推动工作。五区开会以后，税务分局就检讨了业务，工作人员主动向工商业户征求意见，以求改进工作。派出所的警察也自动征求群众意见。
    各区在开过代表会议之后，都迅速认真地执行着会议各项决议。第六、第七两区各界代表会议因系六月上旬所召开，因此，各项议案执行较多。第一、第五两区开会至今时间不长，大部分议案正准备执行。但，各区执行决议情形都很好，已有了很多成绩。
    在执行大会决议中，各区群众都自动组织起来，参加工作，尤其是劳动人民，发挥了最大的积极性，尽其全力协助政府完成必要的市政建设。在房屋修缮、修补道路、清理街巷卫生等三项工作中出力最多。各区为了具体领导工作，已先后建立了房屋修缮和卫生两个委员会，个别区并在应修的街巷内建立了修路委员会。
    修缮房屋方面：
    各区干部首先与派出所一起作了周详的调查，并分别召开了房主房客座谈会，深刻解释了城市房屋政策，在主客双方获致协议后，着手修缮。六区至七月底已修好房屋一千一百零一间，对防止雨季塌房起了很大作用；七区全区需要修缮的一千八百十五间房屋，至七月底已修好四百三十一间，已动工及准备修缮的有七百四十二间。七月，大雨以后，各区均有塌房事件发生，七区区长在大雨倾盆中带领干部抢救灾户，并未发生重大的不幸事件。各区也都展开了救济工作，发放救济粮，救济塌房贫户。
    卫生建设方面：
    在区卫生委员会领导下，广泛进行了宣传动员工作，展开了夏季卫生运动。一般说：现在街巷比过去干净了。如：七区的北水关、后河沿、上堂子等地都比以前清洁多了，各区大工厂、公立小学卫生也在逐步改善着。各区先后展开了防疫工作，一区防疫注射的有三万九千余人，五区有六万九千四百零三人，六区有三万一千五百四十三人（已占全区人口五分之一），七区有五万一千五百十八人。个别区还进行了其他工作，如成立工人诊疗所、对冷食及普通饮食店或摊贩进行了检查，打捞孑孓、捕捉苍蝇、进行户内外大扫除、清除垃圾等。群众普遍反映：我们一定要争取永远生活在清新的空气中。
    各区明沟改为暗沟工程、疏浚工程大部完成或接近完成。特别是一区的泡子河积水，自六月六日动工，不到两个月就将三十多年的污秽淤水，通过暗沟引导出城外。该地附近五百多住户莫不欢腾感谢人民政府。七区代表会后的第一天，就修通了左安门水关，群众说：“这只有人民的政府才能做到。”
    此外，各区建立自来水干管，设自来水供应站，七区建立了二十八处，改造私人水井十六处。五区正进行的有三处，以前吃私人井水是一百元一担，现在吃自来水站的水是五十元一担，群众都很满意。各区也正与北京电业局研究，增设路灯，七区已修好路灯八十六盏，各区还修建了或准备修建一些公共厕所、秽水池等。
    补修道路方面：
    在群众自愿原则下，各街巷已组织修路委员会，群众纷纷参加修路工作。六区由政府补修的已完成虎坊桥、观音寺、西珠市口、西柳树井四条；民办公助的已完成木厂胡同、崇真观及兴隆街三条。六区成人补习学校师生二百余人（其中妇女占百分之七十）曾于八月十一日参加修路，一个半钟头内，便完成了一百五十公尺的土路。七区已修好十二条，约六千一百八十平方公尺。参加修路的有二千六百人。该区弥勒巷、法华寺西街居民，每天晚上七至九时自带铁锹、铁镐等工具，参加修路，三十多米长十余米宽的道路，三天就完成了，有时到晚上十时还不肯休息。
    文教方面：
    各区都准备健全业余学校组织，增设工人夜校、巩固成人补习学校。各区已先后成立或增加儿童识字班，七区已成立了六班，五区六班，六区十七班，七区并在崇外东四块玉天龙寺成立半日学校一处。其他，如个别区准备建立阅览室、晨校、妇女识字班等。
    各区公所在进行这些工作中，都随时听取了群众和区代表的意见，许多区代表也随时反映群众意见，这样区级政权与群众密切联系，对于完成和改进工作上有很大的帮助。区代表会议以后，无疑地，使区级政权工作大大提高了一步。
   （纪纲、志诚）
