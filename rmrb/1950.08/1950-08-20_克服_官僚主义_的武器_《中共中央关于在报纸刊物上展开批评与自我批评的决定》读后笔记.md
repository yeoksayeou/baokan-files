　　Weapon to Overcome "Bureaucracy"
　　Reading Notes on "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications"
　　--Hou Yong, Secretary of the CPC Huolu County Committee
　　With the victory of the people's revolutionary war and the beginning of national economic construction, the CPC Central Committee issued the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications." This is a major measure to strengthen the connection between the Party and the masses, attract millions of working people to participate in the national construction, supervise the work of the Party and the government, raise the awareness of the masses, and overcome bureaucracy. However, when this decision was first promulgated, some comrades felt: "It's so embarrassing to be reported in the newspaper if I make a mistake again!" and adopted a passive attitude towards this decision. In the past, I also simply studied this document once and did not fully understand its importance. It was not until this study, based on the spirit of the document, that I examined our work and initially realized the positive significance of the document. In the past six months, we have accepted more than a dozen major critical issues raised by the masses. From the resolution of these issues, I have learned the following:

　　First, mass supervision and criticism are the most powerful weapons against bureaucracy. Bureaucratic styles in various works hinder the implementation of the Party and government policies and the establishment of people's democratic life. For example, Zhang Quanyin (a cadre promoted after the land reform) in Xiying Village embezzled, was corrupt, raped women, and acted lawlessly in the village for as long as two years. The district-level leadership always regarded him as a "talent," which objectively played a role in condoning him. It was not until this summer when farmer Zhang Xilai criticized him in the People's Daily that it prompted us to conduct an inspection and solve the problem. Another example is that the Beibaisha Village government in the Fourth District concealed burdens and illegally collected about 10,000 jin of grain in arrears of agricultural tax; eighteen village cadres collectively embezzled canal rice and privately sold more than 10,000 jin of cotton seeds borrowed this spring, and shielded deserters to oppress the masses. Such serious problems existed in the village work, but the village branch was rated as a "model branch." When the villagers complained to the higher authorities, the district did not believe it. It was not until the county leadership conducted an inspection that the truth came to light. This kind of bureaucratic leadership style of not understanding the situation and not inspecting the work is common in our work. As a result, it fosters bad cadres to oppress the masses, hinders the implementation of policies, and suppresses the people's democratic rights. Some comrades have advocated: "Isn't it better for us to conduct inspections from top to bottom?!" Yes, inspections from top to bottom are indispensable, but relying solely on inspections from top to bottom is not enough. Leading cadres are limited, and leaders often have their limitations when inspecting work. Therefore, it is necessary to combine inspections from top to bottom with mass supervision from bottom to top to effectively eliminate shortcomings and improve work.

　　Accepting mass criticism and supervision can strengthen the connection between the Party and the masses and effectively improve work. For example, last year, the masses in Dongjiao and Yian villages criticized the unreasonable reduction and exemption in the autumn collection, saying, "Those who should not be reduced were reduced, but those who should be reduced were not." The county people's government accepted the opinions of the masses and conducted an inspection. It also made a review at the People's Congress and proposed remedial measures. As a result, the masses were very satisfied, which ensured the rapid completion of the autumn collection. Therefore, the number of opinions raised by the masses in various villages to the government is increasing day by day.

　　Why did these events happen? Based on these events, the county party committee leadership also inspected the leadership work and especially focused on reviewing the lack of mass perspective and sectarianism: adopting a laissez-faire attitude towards cadres who can successfully complete their work tasks, fearing that the work would collapse without them, so they listened only to one side and did not conduct in-depth inspections; there was also a liberal attitude of avoiding difficulties and not solving problems, as well as errors in estimating the situation, which led to deviations in decision-making. The masses have given us thorough and complete criticism of these issues.

　　In dealing with these events, we realized the meaning of what Comrade Stalin said: "Let the Party, let the Bolsheviks, let all honest workers and laborers in our country expose the shortcomings in our work, the shortcomings in our construction, let them point out the ways to eliminate our shortcomings, so that there will be no stagnation, badness, or corruption in our work and our construction, so that all our work and our construction will improve day by day and move from success to success." The Central Committee's decision is precisely to help us embark on the path of eliminating shortcomings.

　　Second, journalists and editors being independently responsible is a necessary method to protect the democratic rights of the masses, enable the opinions of the masses to be quickly reflected to the leading organs, and fight against the bad tendency of suppressing and persecuting criticism. There was such a fact: the Chengguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative both had serious bureaucratic and policy-violating errors in business operations and leadership. The masses made many suggestions, but they were not completely resolved. Later, although the county adjusted the leadership of the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the problem was not completely resolved. To this end, the director of the District Supply and Marketing Cooperative wrote a criticism and suggestion and gave it to the county's correspondent to forward to the newspaper. However, the county leadership mistakenly believed that "the problem has been solved, why write it?" As a result, it was not sent out. Individual comrades even thought this was "anti-superior behavior." In fact, these comrades made a principled mistake of suppressing criticism. Another time, the masses in Lianhuaying Village accused the village cadres. When the county investigated the district, the district perfunctorily said that it had been resolved, but it was not actually resolved. One of the important manifestations of committing bureaucratic errors is to be divorced from the masses and suppress criticism. Therefore, taking the method of journalists being independently responsible to protect the democratic rights of the masses and fight against those who suppress criticism has become extremely important.

　　Third, treat the opinions of the masses with a serious, earnest, and realistic attitude. Chairman Mao taught us: to come from the masses and go to the masses. However, is the criticism that comes from the masses completely correct and fully mature? This is a major ideological obstacle when we begin to consider the opinions of the masses. Because we lack a mass perspective and do not trust the masses, we often hold a skeptical attitude towards the criticism of the masses. Especially for anonymous letters, we do not think that they are caused by insufficient people's democratic life, but think that these people are uneasy because they are not named. This naturally limits our acceptance of the opinions of the masses. We have received five anonymous letters, and the opinions in four of them are correct. The criticisms of many masses, except for minor details, are basically correct. These opinions are all things that the masses have experienced in their daily lives and are practical problems in the lives of the masses. We must deeply understand Chairman Mao's instruction to "come from the masses and go to the masses" and Comrade Stalin's instruction to listen to the opinions of "small people" and the opinions of the people, and take a resolute revolutionary attitude to protect criticisms that reflect the opinions of the masses. However, we cannot understand accepting mass criticism, listening to mass opinions, and understanding as tailism. The problems raised by the masses sometimes still have their limitations. Therefore, we must analyze these opinions with a highly serious and earnest attitude and deal with these problems according to policy principles. At the end of June, after the People's Daily published the problem of embezzlement by Zhang Quanyin, a village cadre in our county, the agency forwarded readers' opinions saying: the leaders of the district are protecting each other with bad cadres and demanding the punishment of the district cadres. At that time, we did not seriously analyze the actual situation of the relationship between the district leader and Zhang Quanyin, but mistakenly feared that the newspaper would "not agree" and wanted to punish the district cadres. This is obviously a non-Bolshevik attitude lacking seriousness and principle.

　　We also have the wrong idea that "family ugliness should not be publicized." We are willing to say and write about the shortcomings and errors in our work ourselves, but we are unwilling for others to say and write about them. This is an individualistic idea that does not take the interests of the revolution as a prerequisite. It hinders us from seriously implementing the decision of the CPC Central Committee on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications and must be overcome. The construction task of New China is great and arduous, and it is impossible to achieve anything without the participation of millions of working people. The Central Committee's decision gives us such a weapon, consolidates and expands the connection between the Party and the masses, guarantees the democratization of the Party and the country, accelerates social progress, and eliminates the most vicious enemy on our way forward--bureaucracy.

　　克服“官僚主义”的武器
    《中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定》读后笔记
    ——中共获鹿县委书记  侯永
    随着人民革命战争的胜利，和国家经济建设事业的开始，中共中央发布了《关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定》。这是一个加强党与人民群众的联系，吸引千百万劳动群众参加国家建设事业监督党与政府的工作，提高群众觉悟克服官僚主义的重大措施。但是，在这一决定刚刚颁布的时候，有些同志是感到：“再犯了错误，上报纸多难看呀！”而对这一决定抱着消极态度。就是我过去也只把这文件简单地学习了一遍，对其重要性也理解不足。直至在这次学习中，根据文件精神检查了我们的工作，这才初步体会了文件的积极意义。这半年来，我们接受了十几件较大的群众所提出的批评性的问题。从这些问题的解决中使我体会到以下几个问题：
    一、群众性的监督和批评是反对官僚主义的最锐利的武器。各种工作中的官僚主义作风，障碍着党和政府的政策的贯彻，和人民民主生活的建立。例如西营村张全印（土地改革后提拔的干部）在村中贪污腐化、强奸妇女，横行不法达二年之久。区级领导上却始终认为他是个“人材”，客观上起了纵容作用。直到今夏农民张喜来在人民日报上提出批评后，才促使我们进行了检查和解决。又如四区北白砂村政府隐瞒负担，非法征收农业税尾欠万斤左右粮食；十八个村干部又集体贪污渠米，并把今春贷的棉籽万余斤私自变卖，以及包庇逃亡战士欺压群众等，村里工作上存在着如此严重的问题，而该村支部竟被评为“模范支部”。当该村农民向上级提出控告后，区里还不相信。直到县领导机关进行检查后才真象大白。这种不了解下情，不检查工作的官僚主义领导作风，在我们工作中是普遍存在的。其结果是助长坏干部欺压群众，阻碍政策的贯彻，压制人民的民主权利。有些同志曾主张：“咱们从上而下的检查发掘不更好吗？！”是的，自上而下的检查是不可缺少的，但是单靠自上而下的检查是不够的，领导干部是有限的，同时领导者检查工作往往也有其局限性，因之必须把自上而下的检查与自下而上的群众性的监督结合起来，才能有效地消灭缺点，改进工作。
    接受群众的批评和监督，可以加强党与人民群众的联系并有效地改进工作。例如去年东焦、宜安村群众批评了秋征中的减免不合理，他们说：“不该减的减了，该减的反而没有减。”县人民政府接受群众意见，进行检查。并在人民代表大会上作了检讨，提出补救办法。结果群众非常满意，保证了秋征工作迅速完成。各村群众向政府提意见的因此日渐增多。
    为什么会发生这些事件呢？县委领导上根据这些事件对领导工作也进行了检查，并特别着重检讨了缺乏群众观点和宗派主义思想：对能够顺利完成工作任务的干部采取放纵态度，怕离了他们工作要垮台，因此偏听偏信而不深入检查工作；还有避难就易，不解决问题的自由主义态度，以及估计情况有错误，而在决定问题时发生了偏差。而这些问题，群众都已给予我们以透彻无遗的批评。
    在处理这些事件当中，我们体会了斯大林同志说的：“让党、让布尔塞维克、让我国一切诚实的工人和劳动分子揭露我们工作中的缺点、我们建设中的缺点吧，让他们指点消灭我们缺点的途径，以便我们工作中和我们建设中不再有停滞、糟糕、腐败的现象，以便我们的全部工作、我们全部建设一天天的改善并且从成功走到成功吧。”的意义。中央这一决定，正是帮助我们走上消灭缺点的道路的。
    二、记者和编辑独立负责，是保障群众民主权利，使群众意见得以迅速反映到领导机关，并向压制和迫害批评的恶劣倾向进行斗争的必要方法。曾经有这样的事实：城关供销社与县供销社业务经营及领导上都存在着严重的官僚主义与违反政策的错误。群众提了多次意见未得彻底解决。后来县里虽然调整了一下县供销社的领导，但问题并未彻底解决。该区供销社主任为此写了一篇批评与建议交给县里的通讯干事转发报社。但这个批评与建议被县领导上错误地认为：“问题已经解决了，还写它干什么？”结果未发出去。个别同志甚至认为这是“反上行为”。实际上是这些同志犯了压制批评的原则错误。另一次，莲花营村群众控告该村干部。当县里向区里调查时，区里竟搪塞地说已经解决了，实际上并未解决。犯官僚主义错误的重要表现之一就是脱离群众，压制批评，因而采取记者独立负责的办法，以保护群众的民主权利，向压制批评者进行斗争，就成为异常重要的事情了。
    三、以严肃认真、实事求是的态度对待群众意见。毛主席教导我们：要从群众中来到群众中去。但是，从群众中来的批评是否完全正确、完全成熟呢？这是我们开始考虑群众意见时的很大的思想障碍。由于我们缺乏群众观点，不相信群众，因此对群众的批评就常持怀疑的态度。特别是对匿名信，我们不把它认为是由于人民民主生活不充分所促成的，反认为这些人不具名就是不安好心。这样自然就限制了我们对群众意见的接受。我们接到过五封匿名信，其中四封信的意见是正确的。很多群众的批评除小节外，基本上都是正确的。这些意见都是群众日常生活中所体验到的东西，是群众生活中的实际问题。我们必须深切体会毛主席“从群众中来到群众中去”的指示，及斯大林同志倾听“小人物”的意见，倾听人民群众意见的指示，对反映群众意见的批评采取坚决保护的革命态度。但也不能把接受群众批评倾听群众意见了解为尾巴主义。群众提问题有时还有其局限性，因此，我们必须以高度的严肃认真的态度去分析这些意见，根据政策原则去处理这些问题。六月底，人民日报发表了我县村干部张全印贪污的问题后，该社转来读者意见说：该区领导上与坏干部官官相护，要求处分该区干部。当时我们未认真的分析该区领导者与张全印的关系的实际的情况，而错误地怕报社“不答应”就想处分该区区干部。这显然是一种缺乏严肃性原则性的非布尔塞维克的态度。
    我们还有着“家丑不可外扬”的错误思想。工作中的缺点和错误，愿意自己说自己写，而不愿别人说别人写。这是不以革命利益为前提的个人主义思想。它妨害着我们认真地执行中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定，必须加以克服。新中国的建设任务是伟大而艰巨的，没有千百万劳动群众的参加是不可能有所成就的。中央这个决定正是给予我们一个这样的武器，巩固并扩大党与群众的联系，保障党和国家的民主化，加速社会进步，消灭我们前进途中的最凶恶的敌人——官僚主义。
