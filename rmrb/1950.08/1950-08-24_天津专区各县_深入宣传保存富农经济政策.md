Deepen the Publicity of the Policy of Preserving the Rich Peasant Economy

[This newspaper's Tianjin dispatch] After the various counties in the Tianjin Special District vigorously publicized the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy in the upcoming land reform, the production enthusiasm of the general rich peasants has tended to normalize, and the production enthusiasm of the middle peasants has greatly increased. Before the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, the rich peasant class generally harbored fears of land reform, leading to land abandonment and extravagant consumption; the middle peasant class also had ideological concerns and dared not engage in bold production. In June, after the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China" and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report were published, the counties immediately organized cadres at all levels to study and discuss the aforementioned documents. They used various forms to publicize the policies, and combined this with handling practical problems to implement the policies. This has brought about positive changes in all classes, especially the production enthusiasm of rich and middle peasants, which has significantly improved. Shi Yuchao, a rich peasant in Qingguang Village, Tianjin County, sold off his livestock and dismissed his hired laborers last year due to fear of land reform. He did not fertilize or weed his crops, and much of his land was left barren while he spent his days eating and drinking extravagantly. However, after the Land Reform Law was published and he learned about the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy, he became active in production, immediately hiring a long-term worker and buying a large mule, and he began to economize. The rich peasant Yang Shishan also bought livestock, hired a long-term worker, and retrieved the property he had hidden in his daughter's home. An Jianfu, a rich peasant in Fujunmiao, Jinghai County, now has his entire family, men and women, getting up early and going to bed late every day to engage in production. He even repaired the broken cart that had been abandoned for three years. During the summer grain collection, he quickly paid his public grain quota.

Through the publicity of the policies, middle peasants in various places have also dispelled their concerns and begun to actively produce. Wang Dayong, a middle peasant in Xiaodian Village, Tianjin County, said, "If the rich peasants are not touched, then we middle peasants are even more secure. Let's live well!" Zhu Guanglai, a middle peasant in Qingguang Village, had one stone of grain borrowed from him by the militia this spring, which dampened his enthusiasm for making a living. He deliberately wasted money by buying meat to eat every time he went to the market. Later, after his grain was returned and government workers thoroughly publicized the Land Reform Law and production policies, he began to economize on his consumption and greatly regretted his past wastefulness. He has also shown great enthusiasm in production. During this summer grain collection, he became a backbone element in paying the grain quota. In Ci'erzhuang, Jinghai County, through the publicity of the village branch and the influence of the actual actions of party members, the middle peasants eliminated their concerns about "sticking out." This year, the village added eight carts, three head of livestock, and many farm tools. Fourteen peasant households bought seventy-nine mu of land. The entire village's autumn seedlings have already been weeded four times, and every family is competing to live a good life.

However, there are still some problems in the implementation of the policies. Some cadres and poor peasants do not fully understand the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy, so they are not enthusiastic in publicizing the policies, or they have a simple idea of ​​dividing land and have a resistant attitude towards preserving the rich peasant economy. At the same time, some rich peasants are still skeptical. For example, Fu Longxiong, a rich peasant in Anbao Village, Yongqing County, is still selling his houses and land. Some landlords are also taking the opportunity to counterattack, threatening peasants to collect rent and seize land, restricting peasants from freely working on the land they have already been allocated. The counties have promptly dealt with the above-mentioned problems separately, and have combined the handling of practical problems with in-depth publicity and the correction of policies.

　　天津专区各县
    深入宣传保存富农经济政策
    【本报天津讯】天津专区各县在大力宣传今后土地改革中保存富农经济的政策后，一般富农生产情绪已趋正常，中农生产情绪大为提高。该专区在土地改革法公布之前，富农阶层中，一般存有害怕土地改革、荒芜土地和吃喝浪费的现象；中农阶层也有思想顾虑，不敢大胆生产。六月间，“中华人民共和国土地改革法”与刘少奇副主席的报告公布后，各县立即组织各级干部，对上述文件进行了学习讨论，通过各种形式进行宣传，并结合处理实际问题，贯彻执行政策，在各阶层中已发生良好变化，特别是富农、中农的生产情绪，已显著提高。天津县青光村富农石玉超，去年因怕土地改革，卖掉了牲口，把长工解雇了，地里庄稼不上粪，不锄草，大部土地荒芜起来，并终日大吃大喝。但在土地改革法公布并知道保存富农经济的政策后，生产便积极起来，立即雇了长工，并买了一头大骡子，省吃节用。富农杨士善也买了牲口，雇了长工，并把藏到女儿家的财物取了回来。静海县付君庙富农安建富，现在全家男女天天早起晚睡，下地生产，把扔了三年的破车也收拾好了。夏征时，他很快就交齐了公粮。
    通过政策的宣传，各地中农也解除了顾虑，开始积极生产。天津县小淀村中农王大勇说：“不动富农了，咱们中农就更保险了，往好里过吧！”青光村中农朱广来，今年春天被民兵借去了一石粮食，便把过日子的心也散了，每次赶集买肉吃，故意浪费。后来归还了他的粮食，政府工作人员又深入宣传土地改革法，及生产政策之后，他吃用节省起来，并很后悔过去的浪费，在生产上也表现得很积极。这次在夏征中，他成了缴粮的骨干分子。静海县慈儿庄，经过村支部的宣传和党员实际行动的影响，中农消除了“怕冒尖”的顾虑。该村今年共增添大车八辆，牲口三头，和很多农具。并有十四户农民买了七十九亩地。全村秋苗早已锄过四遍，家家比赛过好日子。
    但在政策贯彻上还存在一些问题，有些干部和贫农对保存富农经济政策认识不够，因此对政策宣传不积极，或有单纯分土地思想，对保存富农经济存在抵抗情绪。同时有的富农也还抱着怀疑态度，如永清县安堡村富农傅龙雄，仍在变买房屋土地。有的地主也乘机反攻，威吓农民要收租、夺地，限制农民在已分得的土地上自由劳动。对上述问题，各县已及时分别进行处理，并结合对实际问题的处理进行深入宣传和端正政策。
