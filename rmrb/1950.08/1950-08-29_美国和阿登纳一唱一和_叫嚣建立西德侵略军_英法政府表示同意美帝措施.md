　　The United States and Adenauer Sing in Chorus
    Clamoring for the Establishment of a West German Aggressor Army
    British and French Governments Express Agreement with U.S. Imperialist Measures
    [Xinhua News Agency, 27th Dispatch] U.S. imperialism and its puppet West German government have recently been singing in chorus, openly clamoring for the establishment of a West German aggressor army, attempting to make the currently ongoing war preparations in West Germany public and to carry them out on a larger scale, making West Germany a backbone of the Western war machine.

    As early as August 18, the West German puppet Prime Minister Adenauer told a New York Times reporter that he hoped the next meeting of the U.S., British, and French foreign ministers would make an early decision to allow West Germany to participate in Western European "defense." He said that West German troops should be armed by the United States, and if the necessary weapons could be delivered early, the army could be established quickly.

    On the 23rd, Adenauer again stated, "The world situation requires the establishment of a European army. All European people, including the German people if necessary, should contribute to this." Adenauer even declared that this army was necessary for foreign security.

    Adenauer's statement was made after a meeting with the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, McCloy, and was issued under his instructions. On the same day that Adenauer made his statement, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, in a statement at a press conference regarding the McCloy-Adenauer meeting, openly admitted that Adenauer "did indeed raise the request to increase the forces in Western Europe, including West Germany. Based on the reports I have received, I believe this is his foremost concern." Acheson then stated that this illegal request from West Germany, which completely violated the Potsdam Agreement, should be considered. He said, "The general strengthening of Western European defense is a matter of concern to all of us. How to obtain this strength and what contribution West Germany can make to Western defense is a matter for discussion between governments."

    On the 24th, McCloy further issued a statement saying, "The defense of Western Europe must be a joint effort, must gain strength, and this will include Germany and require the frank and cooperative action of the German people and their representatives."

    Under this open expression from the United States, Britain and France have also echoed in agreement. A British Foreign Office spokesman declared on the 24th, "The British government fully sympathizes with Adenauer's concerns about German security." The French government, which has always been reluctant to agree to the rearmament of West Germany due to strong opposition from its own people, has also "agreed in principle to allow West Germany to expand its police force."

### 美国和阿登纳一唱一和  叫嚣建立西德侵略军  英法政府表示同意美帝措施

　　美国和阿登纳一唱一和
    叫嚣建立西德侵略军
    英法政府表示同意美帝措施
    【新华社二十七日讯】美帝国主义及其傀儡西德政府，最近一唱一和，公然叫嚣建立西德侵略军，企图使目前已在西德进行的备战活动公开化，并更加大规模来进行，使西德成为西方战争机器中的骨干。
    早在八月十八日西德傀儡总理阿登纳即在对纽约时报记者表示，希望下次美、英、法三外长会议及早采取使西德参加西欧“防务”的决定。他说，西德的部队应由美国予以武装，而如果必要的武器能及早运来，军队就可以很快建立。
    二十三日，阿登纳又发表谈话称：“世界局势需要建立一支欧洲军队，所有欧洲人民，如果需要的话，包括德国人民，应对此有所贡献。”阿登纳甚至宣称：这支军队之所以必需乃是为了国外安全。
    阿登纳这次谈话乃是与美国驻德高级专员麦克洛埃举行会谈后，在其授意下发表的。在与阿登纳发表谈话的同日，美国国务卿艾奇逊在记者招待会上就麦、阿会谈发表的声明中公然承认：阿登纳“确实提出了增加西欧包括西德在内的军队的要求。我根据我所收到的报告，相信这是他所最关心的事情。”艾奇逊接着表示应该对西德这种完全违反波茨坦决定的非法要求予以考虑。他说：“西欧防务的普遍加强是我们全都关心的一个问题。至于如何获得此种力量，以及西德在西方防务上可以作何种贡献，是各国政府间应讨论的一个问题。”
    至二十四日，麦克洛埃更进一步发表声明称：“西欧的防务必须是一种联合的努力，必须获得力量，这将包括德国，并且需要德国人民及其代表的坦率和合作的行动。”
    在美国这种公开表示之下，英法两国亦已应声附和。英国外交部发言人已于二十四日宣称：“英国政府充分同情阿登纳对德国安全问题的焦虑。”一向由于国内人民的有力反对从不敢对西德建军问题表示同意的法国政府，亦已“愿在原则上同意令西德扩充警察兵力”。（法新社）
