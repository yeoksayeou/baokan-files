People's Railway News: The rectification campaign in the railway system has begun. The Political Department of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government issued a rectification instruction to the Political Department of the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office and the Political Departments of the various Railway Administrations within the customs on August 5th. The instruction first pointed out that the rectification is mainly to rectify the Party, not to rectify those outside the Party, and the focus is on leading Party cadres. It then clarified that this rectification in the railway system should be a continuation of the struggle against bureaucratic work styles, and all railway bureaus must concentrate their efforts on solving the following problems: 1. Clarify the importance of relying on the working class ideologically at the leadership level, and check and correct various erroneous tendencies in democratic management; 2. Use the spirit of the responsibility system to check various institutions and systems, and any institutions and systems that do not meet the requirements and whose responsibilities are unclear must be rationally improved; 3. Check the relationship between the Party, government, labor union, and the Communist Youth League, correct the phenomenon of the Party monopolizing or laissez-faire leadership over the labor union and the separation of Party and government, and establish a correct relationship between the Party, government, labor union, and the Communist Youth League ideologically and organizationally; 4. Check the relationship between the Party and the masses, correct the "left" and right tendencies in the treatment of non-Party members, and strengthen the unity and education of non-Party members; 5. Check the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres who are careless and do not understand the situation at the lower levels, and establish a scientific and democratic work style that is practical, responsible, and connects with reality and the masses. In addition, the ideas of general Party cadres seeking position, enjoyment, corruption, and degeneration should also be educated and corrected. The instruction stipulates that the main methods of rectification are to combine reading documents with self-examination and summarization of work from top to bottom, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and link the examination of work with the examination of personal thinking.

　　铁路系统开始整风
    铁道部政治部指示所属
    【本报讯】人民铁道消息：铁路系统的整风已经开始。中央人民政府铁道部政治部于八月五日向东北特派员办事处政治部及关内各管理局政治部发出整风指示。该指示首先指出：整风主要是整顿党内，而不是整顿党外，重点是党员领导干部。继阐明铁路系统此次整风应为反对官僚主义作风的继续，各路局务必集中精力着重解决下列问题：一、从领导思想上明确依靠工人阶级的重要性，检查并纠正民主管理中的各种错误偏向；二、用负责制的精神去检查各种机构和制度，凡不合要求的，责任不明的机构和制度必须合理的予以改进；三、检查党、政、工、团的关系，纠正党包办或放任对工会的领导和党政不分的现象，从思想上从组织上树立党、政、工、团的正确关系；四、检查党群关系，纠正对待非党人士的左右倾偏向，加强对非党人士的团结和教育；五、检查领导干部中粗枝大叶不了解下情的官僚主义作风，树立切实负责、联系实际，联系群众的科学化的民主作风。此外，一般党员干部中闹地位，闹享受，贪污腐化等思想，亦应予以教育纠正。指示规定整风的主要方法，是阅读文件与自上而下的检查总结工作相结合，开展批评与自我批评，并从工作检查中联系检查个人思想。
