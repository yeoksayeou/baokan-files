　　Declaration by Five Social Science Research Associations Opposing U.S. Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea
    [From Our Newspaper] The five Chinese social science research associations—the New Philosophy Research Association, the New Historical Science Research Association, the New Economics Research Association, the New Political Science Research Association, and the New Legal Science Research Association—jointly issued a declaration opposing U.S. aggression against Taiwan and Korea. The declaration stated: "No matter what excuses Truman makes, no matter how Acheson uses flowery language to cover up, before the people of the world, the United States' crime of tearing up the United Nations Charter, undermining peace in the Far East, launching aggression, and provoking war is inescapable. No matter how the United States strengthens its military preparations, expands the war, and uses atomic weapons to intimidate, it will have no effect on the Chinese people, who have absolute confidence and assurance in liberating Taiwan, and on the Korean people, who are fighting heroically for independence, freedom, and unification and have achieved brilliant victories. We Chinese social science workers have every reason to believe that the Korean people's just war for liberation and the Chinese people's will to defend the integrity of their national territory and sovereignty will ultimately achieve final victory; the U.S. imperialists' plot to invade Asian countries and create war in an attempt to save their dying fate will be completely shattered in the magnificent and surging waves of the world's people's movement to defend peace."

　　社会科学五研究会宣言反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜
    【本报讯】中国社会科学五研究会——新哲学研究会、新史学研究会、新经济学研究会、新政治学研究会、新法学研究会为反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜联合发表宣言。内称：“不管杜鲁门制造任何借口，不管艾奇逊如何花言巧语地掩饰，在全世界人民面前，美国撕毁联合国宪章，破坏远东和平，发动侵略，挑起战争的罪行是无可逃避的。不管美国如何加强军备，扩大战争，并以使用原子武器进行吓诈，对于具有绝对信心与把握解放台湾的中国人民和为争取独立、自由与统一而英勇战斗并取得了光辉胜利的朝鲜人民，是没有作用的。我们中国社会科学工作者完全有理由相信：朝鲜人民求解放的正义战争和中国人民保卫本国领土主权完整的意志终将取得最后胜利；美帝国主义者侵略亚洲各国制造战争，以求挽救其垂死命运的阴谋，必将在全世界人民保卫和平运动的壮阔汹涌的波涛中彻底粉碎。”
