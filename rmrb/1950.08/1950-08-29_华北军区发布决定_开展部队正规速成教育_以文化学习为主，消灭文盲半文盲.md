　　North China Military Region Issues Decision
    To Launch Intensive Regular Education in Troops
    Focusing on Cultural Learning to Eliminate Illiteracy and Semi-literacy
    [This Newspaper] News: The North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army issued a decision on troop education on July 10th, planning to carry out troop education focusing on cultural education. The decision stipulates that from October, the time spent on cultural education in the troops should account for 70% of the total education time. The decision stipulates: "The cultural education of the troops should adopt the policy of regularity and intensification, eliminate illiteracy and semi-literacy (those who have not graduated from elementary school), strive to raise the general soldiers to the level of elementary school graduation in about three years, and universally improve the cultural level of cadres from the current level, and improve some to the high school level, so that they have the conditions to enter specialized schools or universities for further study. Cadres or soldiers who do not meet the above level should be given cultural education according to their cultural level (rather than according to their position). However, the focus should be on improving the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres."
    In order to achieve the above tasks, the first is to strengthen the cultural education of cadres in service, so that the troops become huge schools, and cultural education for cadres in service will be universally carried out in agencies at all levels above the regimental level. In addition, leading agencies above the military level will set up middle and primary schools to transfer cadres and some tested outstanding soldiers for off-the-job study. The military and political cadre schools and training teams under the provincial military regions and the Inner Mongolia Military Region will be reorganized into regular cultural schools or add cultural courses according to the situation.
    The North China Military Region requires its subordinate leading organs and cadres to quickly learn to lead cultural and educational work, and list leading cultural and educational work as a regular and main task, and actively solve the necessary funds, equipment and cadres for carrying out cultural education. More than a thousand intellectual students of the First General Detachment of North China Military and Political University have all been assigned to cultural and educational work positions; the surplus cadres of the four military regions of Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, and Chahar will also be used to supplement cultural and educational cadres first. In addition, some teachers will be recruited, and some people will be transferred from the existing commanders and fighters to serve as cultural and educational work. Textbooks will be uniformly printed and distributed by the North China Military Region.
    At the same time, the military region requires all troops to appropriately and selectively improve military education on the basis of consolidating existing achievements, with cultural education as the main focus. On the one hand, the political and ideological education of the entire army is to systematically study Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the party's policies in a regular and systematic manner according to different levels; on the other hand, it is to cultivate new morality, working methods, and work styles through work, life, production, and other activities. The two should be combined. General military, political and logistics cadres in the organs, who have the equivalent of a junior high school graduation level, should focus on studying theory.

　　华北军区发布决定
    开展部队正规速成教育
    以文化学习为主，消灭文盲半文盲
    【本报讯】人民解放军华北军区于七月十日发布了关于部队教育的决定，计划开展以文化教育为主的部队教育。决定自十月份起，部队中文化教育的时间应占全部教育时间的百分之七十。决定中规定：“部队的文化教育应采取正规与速成的方针，消灭文盲和半文盲（不及高小毕业程度者），争取三年左右将一般战士提高到高小毕业程度，将干部的文化程度从现有水平普遍提高一步，并使一部分提高到高中程度，以便有条件进入专门学校或大学深造。凡不及上述程度的干部或战士，均应按其文化水平（而不是按其职位），分别进行文化教育。但重点应当是提高工农干部的文化水平。”
    为实现上述任务，首先是加强在职干部的文化教育，使部队成为巨大学校，团以上各级机关将普遍开展在职干部的文化教育。另外，军以上领导机关分别开办中、小学，抽调干部及一部分经过考验的优秀战士进行离职学习。各省军区和内蒙军区所属的军政干部学校和教导队，将分别情况改组为正规文化学校或增设文化课程。
    华北军区要求所属各级领导机关和干部，迅速学会领导文教工作，把领导文教工作列为经常的主要工作之一，积极解决进行文化教育所必需的经费、设备和干部等问题。华北军大一总队的千余知识分子学员，已全部分配到文教工作岗位上；河北、平原、山西、察哈尔四个军区的编余干部，亦将首先用以补充文教干部。此外，并将招聘一部分教员，并在现有指战员中调拨一部分人担任文教工作。教材由华北军区统一印发。
    同时，军区要求各部队在以文化教育为主的情况下，对军事教育应在巩固现有成绩的基础上适当地有重点地加以提高。对全军的政治思想教育，一方面是分别程度，正规地系统地学习马列主义、毛泽东思想和党的政策；一方面是通过工作、生活、生产及其他各种活动来培养新的道德观、工作方法与工作作风。两者应结合进行。机关中的一般军政后勤干部，具有相当于初中毕业程度者，以学习理论为主。（华北解放军报社稿）
