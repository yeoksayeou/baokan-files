　　CPC Cheng'an County Committee Accepts Criticism from Party Newspaper
    Earnestly Corrects Deviations in Work
　　Li Chaoshan, Zhang Yanbei, Ji Keyi
    Editor's Note: On June 12th, this newspaper criticized Cheng'an County, Hebei, for its coercive commandism in well-digging work and its error of forcibly borrowing cotton and grain from middle peasants, which seriously undermined the prestige of the Party and the government among the masses and violated the principle of rural solidarity and production. The following report concerns the situation after the CPC Cheng'an County Committee and the People's Government accepted the criticism from the Party newspaper and corrected the deviations. Cheng'an County's approach and methods for correcting deviations are correct. This is primarily manifested in their implementation of the mass line in their work. Only when cadres at all levels of the county, district, and village truly recognize their errors ideologically can deviations be thoroughly corrected. Conversely, if simple and rigid orders are used, the result will not only fail to correct the deviations but may also lead to new ones. Secondly, it is necessary to combine the work of correcting deviations with production and grain requisition work. This allows district and village cadres to deeply understand that the correct work attitude and work style can both accomplish the work and be welcomed and supported by the broad masses.
    Since the People's Daily and the Hebei Daily criticized Cheng'an County's coercive commandism in well-digging work and its error of forcibly borrowing cotton and grain from middle peasants, the CPC Cheng'an County Committee and the local People's Government have taken various necessary measures to correct them.
    After the publication of the criticisms in the newspapers, the cadres of the county, district, and village, especially the district and village cadres, showed great ideological resistance. Some said, "How can we work in the future? Everything becomes coercive commandism at the slightest provocation." Some village cadres complained to the district cadres, saying, "If you hadn't told me to do it this way, would I have made a mistake? How can I admit my mistake?!" Some even said, "Active work leads to mistakes, not working leads to no mistakes." Some cadres, as a result, showed a passive attitude in their work, preferring to do less work rather than make the mistake of coercive commandism. For example, in the movement to eliminate aphids and locusts, some district cadres did not dare to boldly mobilize the masses. Individual village cadres did not dare to move unless the masses moved, and some even deliberately made things difficult for the district cadres, demanding that the district cadres issue orders. The district cadres had no choice but to return to the district for discussion, or adopt a "no solution" attitude. Regarding the issue of returning the cotton and grain forcibly borrowed from middle peasants or changing it to free lending, the village cadres had even greater ideological resistance. They believed that "this is the higher-ups deliberately making things difficult for us." For example, the cadres of Southwest Village in the First District said, "When digging wells, we ran around borrowing things, saying nice things until our mouths were dry. The well was dug, and the borrowers didn't say anything, but the higher-ups asked us to pay interest to them. Who is going to pay it? Isn't this just making things difficult for the village cadres!" Some felt that doing so was too humiliating; individual cadres even believed that the newspaper reporters only knew this trick and wanted to let them try it.
    This shows that it is necessary to solve the problem ideologically from top to bottom. First, the CPC Cheng'an County Committee, in coordination with the People's Government, conducted various necessary persuasion and mobilization efforts. County Party Secretary Liu Qi made repeated criticisms and explanations on this matter at the meeting of key district cadres on June 19th, pointing out the roots of bureaucratism and commandism and their harm to the Party and the people. At the same time, he criticized the individual cadres who believed that "criticism in the newspaper is not as good as secret reporting" and were unwilling to publicly expose their mistakes. Ideological mobilization was also carried out in conjunction with the mobilization report for Party rectification and cadre rectification and the development of rectification and study. This enabled the county and district cadres to recognize their mistakes ideologically. Secondly, in order to further correct the erroneous thinking of the village cadres, County Head He Ming, on behalf of the People's Government, admitted at the representatives' meeting of all circles the errors of coercive commandism and infringement of the interests of middle peasants caused by bureaucratism in leadership. He pointed out that these errors should be corrected immediately and asked the representatives to help the district and village cadres to correct their errors, so that all the people could feel at ease in production. The County Party Committee then went to the districts in the form of checking and reporting on work and studying policies to conduct ideological education for the district and village cadres, so that they could consciously correct their errors.
    After a long period of explanation and education, some village cadres truly recognized the seriousness of their mistakes ideologically and began to correct them. They apologized to those who had been detained. For example, in Linlibao Village, in addition to the village cadres apologizing to those who had been detained during the well-digging, the district secretary and district head also personally went to the village to express their condolences and apologies.
    At this time, the County Party Committee, in coordination with the People's Government, transferred more than 20 cadres from the county-level organs (mostly key district cadres) on July 18th, led by the main cadres of the county to the districts (focusing on the first and second districts), to vigorously implement the work of correcting deviations in conjunction with production and summer requisition. The working steps are generally as follows: After arriving in the district, the main cadres of the county convened a meeting of all district cadres, divided the villages with more problems of forcibly borrowing cotton and grain from middle peasants into several groups according to the production situation, and convened a meeting of village cadres in each group, led by cadres equivalent to the main district cadres and above, to explain the problem, conduct group discussions, correct their attitudes, and come up with solutions. Then, the county and district cadres, in coordination with the village cadres, convened branch meetings and village cadre meetings in the villages to conduct ideological education and correct errors. Then, a meeting of well-digging households was convened to affirm the achievements of well-digging, which is a long-term plan that is beneficial to the development of production. At the same time, it was emphasized that the implementation of free lending is now in effect, and it is wrong to forcibly borrow cotton and grain from middle peasants. They were persuaded to consciously and actively return the cotton and grain, or negotiate interest rates with the borrowers and return them on a regular basis. Finally, a meeting of the borrowers was convened to explain the policies, admit mistakes, and explain the difficulties of the well-digging households, hoping that both parties would agree on interest rates and return them on a regular basis. If the well-digging households really have difficulties in repaying, and the borrowers must have it now, a portion of the well-digging loan grain can be drawn to lend to the well-digging households to repay the borrowers. Finally, a mass meeting was convened to summarize the work, affirm the achievements, point out the errors, and explain the production policies. Currently, each district has held a meeting of village cadres in each group, and the work of correcting deviations in some villages has already been completed.

### 中共成安县委接受党报批评  认真纠正工作中的偏向

　　中共成安县委接受党报批评
    认真纠正工作中的偏向
　　李朝山　张雁北　冀克一
    编者按：六月十二日，本报曾批评河北成安县打井工作中的强迫命令和强借中农棉粮的错误，严重地破坏了党与政府在群众中的威信，违反了农村团结生产的方针。下面的报道是中共成安县委与人民政府接受党报批评后纠正偏向的情况。成安县纠偏的方针和方法是正确的。这首先表现在他们在工作中贯彻了群众路线。只有真正使县区村各级干部从思想上认识了错误，才能彻底地纠正偏向。相反地若以简单生硬的命令方式，其结果不但偏向不能纠正，还可能再发生新的偏向。其次，纠偏工作和生产征粮工作结合进行是很必要的。这样可以使区村干部能够深刻地体会到正确的工作态度与工作作风，是既能作好工作，又能受到广大群众欢迎与拥护的。
    自人民日报、河北日报上批评成安县在打井工作中的强迫命令作风和强借中农棉粮的错误后，中共成安县委和当地人民政府就采取各种必要措施进行纠正。
    报纸上的批评发表后，县、区、村干部特别是区、村干部在思想上是有很大抵抗的。有的说：“以后工作还有法作吗？动不动成了强迫命令。”有的村干部抱怨区干部说：“要不是您叫俺这样作俺能犯错误吗？叫俺承认错误那怎么行呢？！”有的甚至说：“积极工作就有错误，不做工作就没错误。”也有些干部因此在工作中表现束手束脚，抱着宁愿少作些工作也不要犯强迫命令错误的消极态度。如在除蚜灭蝗运动中，部分区干部就不敢大胆发动群众。个别村干部是群众不动自己也不敢动，有些还故意难为区干部，要求区干部下命令。区干部没办法只好回区讨论，或者采取不了了之的态度。对退还强借中农的棉粮或改为自由借贷问题，村干部思想上抵抗更大，他们认为“这是上面故意难为我们”。如一区西南庄村干部说：“在打井时东跑西跳借东西，说好话把嘴都说烂了，井打好了，被借户还没说什么，上级又叫给人家出利息，叫谁出呢？这不是活叫村干部作难吗！”有的感到这样作太丢人；个别干部甚至认为报社记者就会这一套，叫他来试试。
    这就说明了必须自上而下的从思想上来解决问题。首先中共成安县委协同人民政府进行了各种必要的说服动员，县委书记刘崎在六月十九日区的主要干部会议上对此作了反复的批判和解释，指明官僚主义与命令主义的根源，及其对党对人民的危害。同时批判了个别干部认为“报纸上批评不如秘密汇报”的不愿公开揭露错误的思想。在整党整干动员报告与开展整风学习中又结合进行了思想动员。这样才使县区干部从思想上认识了自己的错误。其次为进一步纠正村干部的错误思想，何明县长在各界代表会议上代表人民政府承认了由领导上的官僚主义所造成的强迫命令与侵犯中农利益的错误。并指出这些错误应当立即纠正，要求代表们帮助区村干部来改正错误，使全体人民安心生产。县委又到区里以检查汇报工作、学习政策等方式，对区村干部进行了思想教育，使他们自觉地改正错误。
    经过了长时期的解释教育，部分村干部真正从思想上认识了错误的严重，就开始纠正自己的错误。向被扣的人作了道歉。如林里堡村除村干部对打井中被扣过的人进行道歉外，区书、区长也亲到该村慰问道歉。
    县委此时又协同人民政府抽调县直机关干部二十余名（大部为区主要干部）于七月十八日由县的主要干部分头率领到各区（重点为一、二区）配合区干部结合生产夏征大力贯彻纠偏工作。工作步骤一般是：到区后，由县的主要干部分头召开全体区干部会议，根据生产情况将强借中农棉粮问题较多的村划分为若干片村，由相当于区主要干部以上干部召开片村村干部会议讲明问题，分组讨论，端正态度，想出纠正办法。然后由县区干部协同村干部到村召开支部会，村干部会议，进行思想教育，纠正错误。再召开打井户会议，肯定打井成绩，打井是百年大计，有利发展生产。但同时强调说明现在是实行自由借贷，强借中农棉粮是错误的。说服他们自觉的主动的归还，或和被借户商定利息定期归还。最后召开被借户会议，讲明政策，承认错误；同时说明打井户困难，希望双方自定利息，定期归还。如打井户真正有困难还不起，而被借户当下非要不可时，可抽一部打井贷粮，贷给打井户归还被借户。最后召开群众大会，总结这次工作，肯定成绩，指出错误并讲明生产政策。现各区都开了片村村干部会议，有的村庄纠偏工作已经结束。
