Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, August 3rd (TASS): Bakhtar-i Emruz reports: The U.S. government's decision to send U.S. Marines to Iran to "protect its diplomatic missions" has been proven by facts. The first batch of U.S. Marines has already arrived in Tehran by air. These personnel will immediately replace the Iranian gendarmes protecting the U.S. Embassy.

It is expected that another batch of American soldiers will arrive in Tehran this week, and they will be under the command of the U.S. consulates in various Iranian cities.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, August 4th (TASS): Damascus's *Aleppo* newspaper writes: The correspondent of the Arab News Agency in Baghdad has learned that the commander of the British armed forces in the Middle East has sent a new team of troops and weapons and equipment to Iraq. The Iraqi people saw British troops heading towards the Iranian and Turkish borders at night. In addition, the headquarters of the British air force base at Habbaniyah (west of Baghdad) is expected to receive a large number of aircraft in a few days.
