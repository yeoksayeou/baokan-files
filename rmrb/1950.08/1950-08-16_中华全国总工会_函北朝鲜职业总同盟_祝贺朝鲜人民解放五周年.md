　　Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a letter to the General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea on the 11th to congratulate them on the fifth anniversary of the liberation of the Korean people. The original letter is as follows:
    To the General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea, to all Korean worker brothers:
    At this moment when the Korean Liberation War is achieving brilliant victories, and also on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the liberation of the Korean people, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people extend their respects and heartfelt congratulations to the Korean people with infinite joy and excitement.
    Five years ago, the great Soviet Red Army defeated the army of Japanese imperialism and completely destroyed the Japanese imperialist brutal rule over the Korean people. The North Korean people were also liberated. For five years, under the leadership of the Korean people's leader, General Kim Il-sung, the people have been united as one, establishing the free and happy Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Korean working class has always stood at the forefront of the people, working actively with selfless spirit, developing production, improving the lives of the Korean people, and consolidating the material foundations of national defense.
    However, American imperialism and its puppet Syngman Rhee have been deliberately attempting to enslave the Korean people and turn Korea into a colony of American imperialism. On June 25th, they launched a large-scale invasion. However, the Korean people and the People's Army gave the invaders a head-on blow. In order to save its fate of defeat, the American aggressor is using its air force to carry out barbarous bombing of rear cities, schools, hospitals, residences, and industrial areas, and slaughtering peaceful Korean residents. The Chinese people are extremely angry at the towering crimes of the American aggressors and resolutely protest against the American aggressors. We are willing to do everything possible to support the Korean people's just struggle for national unification and independence.
    We firmly believe that the Korean people, who have already achieved brilliant victories, will never be intimidated by these barbaric acts of the American aggressors. On the contrary, it will increase their hatred and strengthen their courage and strength to fight, drive the American aggressors into the sea, and completely liberate Korean territory.
    Victory belongs to the Korean people under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung!
    The Chinese people and the Chinese working class will always stand together with the Korean people and the Korean working class to resolutely oppose American imperialist aggression.
    Long live the liberation of the Korean people!
    Long live the Korean people's leader, General Kim Il-sung!
    Long live the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people!
              All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                August 11th

　　中华全国总工会
    函北朝鲜职业总同盟
    祝贺朝鲜人民解放五周年
    【新华社十五日讯】中华全国总工会于十一日致函北朝鲜职业总同盟祝贺朝鲜人民解放五周年。原函如下：北朝鲜职业总同盟转朝鲜全体工人兄弟们：
    当此朝鲜解放战争获得辉煌的胜利，又值朝鲜人民解放五周年的纪念日的时候，中国工人阶级和中国人民以无限欢欣鼓舞的心情向朝鲜人民致敬并表示衷心的祝贺。
    五年前，伟大的苏联红军打垮了日本帝国主义的军队，并彻底摧毁了日本帝国主义对朝鲜人民残酷的统治。北朝鲜人民也就得到了解放。五年来，在朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军领导下，万众一心，建立了自由幸福的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。朝鲜工人阶级，始终站在人民的最前列，以忘我的精神，积极工作，发展了生产，提高了朝鲜人民的生活，也巩固了国防的物质基础。
    但是美帝国主义和其傀儡李承晚处心积虑地要奴役朝鲜人民。把朝鲜变为美帝的殖民地。六月二十五日大举侵犯。但是朝鲜人民和人民军予侵犯者以迎头痛击。美国侵略者为挽救其失败命运，正以空军向后方城市、学校、医院、住宅和工业区，进行野蛮轰炸，并屠杀朝鲜和平居民。中国人民，对美国侵略者这种滔天的罪行，万分愤怒，并向美国侵略者坚决抗议。我们愿尽一切可能，支援朝鲜人民正义的为祖国统一和独立的斗争。
    我们坚信：已经取得辉煌胜利的朝鲜人民，绝不会被美国侵略者这些野蛮行为所吓倒，相反地更会增加他们的憎恨，更加强他们战斗的勇气和力量，把美国侵略者赶到大海中去，全部解放朝鲜国土。
    胜利是属于在金日成将军领导下的朝鲜人民！
    中国人民、中国工人阶级始终和朝鲜人民、朝鲜工人阶级一起坚决反对美帝国主义侵略。
    朝鲜人民解放万岁！
    朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军万岁！
    中朝人民友谊团结万岁！
              中华全国总工会
                八月十一日
