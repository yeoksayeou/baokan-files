Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 5th, TASS dispatch: At the Security Council meeting on August 3rd, Soviet representative Malik stated in his speech: "The Security Council meeting has had to spend time discussing procedural matters regarding the arrangement of the agenda for the third day already, in which the Korean issue will be included on the Security Council's agenda.

	The Soviet Union Proposes a Peaceful Resolution to the Korean Issue; The United States Insists on Continuing Aggression Against Korea

During the discussion, two opposing positions on this issue have clearly formed: whether to discuss this issue in the interest of peace, with the aim of a peaceful resolution, as the Soviet delegation is currently insisting, or whether to discuss this issue with the aim of further continuing military operations in Korea, intensifying the U.S. government's armed intervention in the Korean people, and expanding the scope of this aggression and the goals of this war.

The statements made by the U.S. representative and the content of his proposed resolution illustrate that the U.S. government insists on continuing and intensifying aggression and is trying every means to obstruct a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.

The U.S. government has moved from a policy of preparing for aggression to direct and active aggression, and is now attempting to involve the United Nations in the vortex of its military adventure in Korea, with the aim of expanding and intensifying aggression against the Korean people.

The Soviet government has consistently and steadfastly adhered to a policy of peace and regards the United Nations as an instrument of peace. It now proposes to the Security Council a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.

The Soviet delegation, on the instructions of the Soviet government, has placed the matter of a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue on the Security Council's agenda, requesting the Security Council to urgently and without delay discuss this issue and take the necessary measures for a peaceful resolution.

However, what is the U.S. delegation's response to the Soviet proposal? In order to obstruct the discussion of the Soviet proposal, the U.S. government instructed its delegation to engage in filibustering tactics: on the eve of the Security Council meeting of August 1st, presided over by the Soviet representative, the U.S. delegation hastily put forward its proposal, which it now suggests the Security Council should only consider, while rejecting the Soviet proposal to include the issues of "recognition of the representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as China's representative" and "peaceful resolution of the Korean issue" on the Security Council's agenda.

In order to obstruct the consideration of these two urgent issues aimed at restoring and consolidating peace in Korea and restoring the legitimate composition of the Security Council—because without China's participation, the Security Council cannot be considered to be performing its functions in its legitimate composition, and therefore cannot pass legitimate resolutions—the measures suggested in the U.S. delegation's proposal are essentially aimed at intensifying military operations in Korea and expanding the U.S. government's aggression against the Korean people.

The U.S. representative and his British colleague attempt to conceal the aggressive nature of this suggestion with the rhetoric of "localizing the conflict." However, this rhetoric is merely being used by them to conceal America's ambitions. America's ambition is to intensify aggression against Korea, increase the number of troops and armaments, involve the armed forces of other countries in the vortex of fighting against the Korean people, thereby expanding the scale of military operations, intensifying the barbaric and terroristic air raids by U.S. aircraft on peaceful Korean towns and villages, and increasing the number of casualties among Korean civilians.

Looking back at the history of Anglo-American imperialism, everyone knows the ominous meaning of the phrases "localizing the conflict" and "appeasement."

Relying on such shameless means, the U.S. delegation is attempting to obstruct the Security Council from considering a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. Therefore, there is a fundamental difference between the issue raised by the Soviet delegation for the Security Council's consideration and the suggestion put forward by the U.S. delegation. The Soviet delegation has proposed a discussion on a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, and this topic itself illustrates the Soviet government's desire for peace and to achieve a peaceful resolution through the Security Council.

	Evidence Conclusively Shows that South Korea Launched the Offensive and that it was Provoked and Premeditated by the United States

The U.S. government insists on including its proposal on the agenda and attempts to attach a fabricated name to this proposal—“Accusation of Aggression Against the Republic of Korea.” It attempts to conceal American aggression against the Korean people; to interpret the outbreak and development of the Korean incident in a one-sided, American-style, deliberately fabricated manner; and to place the blame for the outbreak of the Korean incident on the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

However, irrefutable materials and facts have proven that the Korean incident, which began on June 25th, was caused by the South Korean authorities' army launching provocative offensives against the border areas of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

In the statement made by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko, official statements and conclusive facts were presented, proving to the world that this offensive was launched according to a long-premeditated and prepared plan, under the leadership and direct participation of U.S. military advisors, and was known to senior U.S. officials in advance—Defense Minister Johnson, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, and State Department advisor Dulles—and was not launched without their consent.

There is no need to reiterate and cite these facts. I only want to draw the attention of the Security Council members to a photograph published in British and American newspapers on June 26th—the second day of the outbreak of the Korean incident. This revealing photograph shows none other than Dulles, the official advisor to the U.S. State Department, U.S. "Ambassador" to South Korea Muccio, and U.S. military advisors, standing in the trenches south of the 38th parallel with officers of the South Korean army of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. Probably none of the members of the Security Council believe that Dulles and Muccio were picking violets in the trenches. Not at all, Dulles was engaged in something more tedious and more in line with his warmongering tendencies. Dulles's subsequent remarks proved that he was one of the main instigators of the Korean incident. This photograph proves that America's aggression against Korea was the result of a long-premeditated plan. The former Minister of Interior of the Rhee Syngman government, forty-eight former members of the South Korean "National Assembly," and many officers of the Rhee Syngman army have all confirmed in their talks that the offensive against North Korea was launched at dawn on June 25th this year on the orders of Rhee Syngman, who had previously received orders from MacArthur to prepare and implement the "Northern Expedition" plan.

	From an International and Legal Point of View, the United States is Directly Engaging in Armed Aggression Against Korea

After the U.S. ruling clique provoked their South Korean puppets to launch an armed offensive against the border areas of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, they hastily used this provocation to justify their long-premeditated and prepared armed aggression against the Korean people.

Everyone who is even slightly objective understands that the Korean civil war is being fought between South Koreans and North Koreans.

The hostilities between Koreans—Northerners and Southerners—are domestic in nature, a civil war. Therefore, there is absolutely no basis for considering these hostilities as aggression. An act of aggression occurs when one country manifestly attacks another country. Since the Soviet delegation put forward a definition of aggression in the Security Issues Committee of the Geneva Disarmament Conference in 1933, the Soviet government has consistently adhered to this position on the issue of defining aggression.

This definition is instructive for an international institution that determines which party is responsible for the offensive, who is the aggressor and invader.

As is well known, according to this definition, declaring war by one country against another, the invasion of the territory of another country by the armed forces of one country (even without a declaration of war), the bombing of the territory of another country by the armed forces of one country, etc., are all considered acts of aggression.

According to this definition, no political, strategic, or economic reasons can be used as an excuse for launching an offensive.

Refusing to recognize that the territory of the attacked country has any characteristics sufficient to indicate that it is a country cannot be used as an excuse for aggression. Revolutionary or counter-revolutionary movements, civil war, and the establishment or preservation of one or another political, economic, or social system in any country cannot be used as an excuse for an offensive.

This definition of aggression and offensive, i.e., of the aggressor, was largely adopted in May 1933 by the Security Issues Committee of the League of Nations, which was composed of representatives from seventeen countries. It must be specifically pointed out, and the Security Council must pay attention to the fact, that the organization of the aforementioned committee included several countries that are currently members of the Security Council, namely: the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Norway. Therefore, the five countries that are currently members of the Security Council, through their representatives, accepted the aforementioned international declaration on the definition of aggression and aggressor.

However, due to the delay of some countries, this matter was not concluded until 1939, and by then war had already broken out. From the perspective of the international and legal standards and definitions contained in the aforementioned declaration, the U.S. government's military actions against the Korean people constitute direct armed aggression, and the U.S. government is the offensive party, i.e., the aggressor.

Although the United States has not formally declared war, it has sent armed forces to invade Korean territory. The aforementioned declaration considers such an act to be aggression.

The U.S. land, sea, and air forces are continuing to bomb Korean territory, attacking Korean ships and air forces. According to the aforementioned declaration, such actions constitute acts of aggression, and the United States is the attacking country, i.e., the aggressor.

U.S. army, marine, and air force troops have landed on Korean territory and are engaging in military operations there against the Korean people who are currently in a state of civil war. This action by the United States constitutes an act of aggression.

The United States has blockaded the Korean coast and ports at sea. According to the aforementioned declaration, these actions constitute acts of aggression.

The United States is attempting to use so-called "strategic reasons" to justify its aggression against Korea; it intends to extend its line of defense as far away from its own borders as possible, claiming that this is for the purpose of "national security."

Isn't it obvious that this explanation is unreasonable and cannot be used as an excuse for U.S. aggression against the Korean people? According to the aforementioned definition of the term aggression, this action constitutes an act of direct aggression.

This definition straightforwardly states that reasons of a political, strategic, or economic nature cannot be used as an excuse for aggression.

Therefore, examining the U.S. government's actions in Korea in accordance with the interpretation of the term aggression in the aforementioned declaration undeniably proves one fact: the U.S. government has interfered in the civil war in Korea between two factions of the same country and has thereby engaged in armed intervention against the Korean people.

As for the war being waged between North Koreans and South Koreans, this is a civil war within one country and does not fall within the definition of aggression because the war is not being waged between two countries, but between two parts of the Korean people who are temporarily divided into two government camps.

Therefore, the conflict in Korea is a domestic conflict. The definition of aggression cannot be applied to South Koreans or North Koreans, just as the definition of aggression could not be applied to the American Southerners and Northerners when they waged a civil war to unify their country. As is well known, at that time, the role of aggressor was played by Britain, which attempted to interfere in the civil war and obstruct the unification of the American North and South, just as it is now interfering in the Korean civil war with the United States, attempting to obstruct the unification of that country.

The situation in China is also the same. As is well known, the struggle there between the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Northern People's Liberation Movement has never been regarded as aggression. In light of this, all foreign countries have avoided interfering in this domestic conflict, avoiding interfering in this civil war.

From all this, it can be concluded that the only aggressors in Korea are those countries that have troops stationed on Korean territory and are interfering in the struggle between Northerners and Southerners, thereby expanding the scope of military operations.

Therefore, in Korea, on the one hand, there is a domestic conflict—a civil war—between North Koreans and South Koreans, and on the other hand, there is the U.S. government's armed intervention in this Korean civil war in the form of armed aggression, which fully conforms to the definition of aggression in the declaration on the definition of aggression adopted in May 1933 by the Security Issues Committee of the League of Nations (composed of representatives from seventeen countries, including representatives from the United States).

As is well known, the United Nations Charter also clearly prohibits the United Nations from interfering in the internal affairs of any country, as long as the issue in dispute is a conflict between two groups within the same country, within the same nation.

In accordance with this principle, the United Nations Charter stipulates that the Security Council can only intervene when the issue in dispute involves matters of an international nature rather than a domestic nature.

This is the essence of the Korean issue and the American armed aggression against the Korean people, as well as the reality of the situation.

Therefore, the people of the world and the United Nations are currently faced with the fact that, on the one hand, there is the U.S. government's open armed aggression against Korea, and on the other hand, there is the U.S. attempt to drag the United Nations into this act of aggression.

	The Soviet Union Demands that the United Nations Firmly Uphold Peace and Abandon Encouraging and Protecting American Aggression Against Korea

The U.S. government has long been deliberately preparing to invade Korea and has therefore been obstructing the regular resolution of the issue of Chinese participation in the Security Council since January of this year. It is precisely for this reason that China has not been able to occupy a seat in the Security Council through its only legitimate government—the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China—which has also made it impossible for the Soviet representative to attend the Council meetings.

Taking advantage of the absence of two permanent members of the Security Council—the Soviet Union and China—the United States, in the Security Council, at its own will, directs its military-political allies, and with a fire-alarm-like haste, forces the Security Council to pass several illegal and shameful resolutions, on the one hand to spread a smokescreen to cover up American aggression against the Korean people, and on the other hand to attempt to drag other countries into this war, and to do its best to ignite the flames of war in Korea and the Far East.

The localized internal Korean conflict provoked by the U.S. government has not only been immediately used as an excuse for military intervention in Korean internal affairs, but has also been used to cover up its expansion of aggression in a vast area of Asia—from the coasts of Korea and Japan all the way to Vietnam—and to cover up its interference in the internal affairs of the people of China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. These are well-known facts, and no matter how one-sidedly fabricated the rhetoric that the United States so widely and wantonly disseminates through its official channels or by the U.S. external political propaganda system—the notorious "Voice of America"—can refute these facts. These facts cannot be refuted either by General MacArthur's hastily pieced-together communiqués, or by the procedural tricks of the U.S. representative in the Security Council. The U.S. government is attempting to submit General MacArthur's communiqués to the Security Council as the U.S. government's own "report" on the progress of U.S. military aggression against Korea.

Due to American armed aggression against Korea, the Security Council and the United Nations Organization are faced with two paths—the path of peace and the path of war. The Security Council must choose: whether to invest a larger number of human and material resources into the war and allow the war to continue to expand, or to firmly turn towards peace, to follow the path of peaceful resolution, as all peace-loving peoples in the world demand of the Security Council, and all peace-loving peoples in the world are led by the Soviet Union, led by the Soviet leader and the genius mentor, the great Stalin.

The ruling circles of the United States are dragging the Security Council and the United Nations onto the path of war. They are eager to establish world hegemony, and they have long been following the path of aggression. Now, they have gone further to take direct aggressive actions, brazenly taking brutal acts of aggression against the peace-loving Korean people, going down the road of directly interfering in Korean internal affairs, and attempting to use armed intervention to prevent the Korean people from realizing their long-standing dream and hope of establishing a free, unified, and independent Korean state.

Now that the U.S. government has become increasingly entangled in the Korean war, it is now working to involve other governments, especially the ruling circles of the colonial powers—Britain and its dominions, France, and the Netherlands—in the war, attempting to force them to jointly engage in armed aggression against the Korean people, as well as intensify aggression against the peoples of other Asian countries who are fighting for freedom and national independence.

The Soviet Union, in order to remain true to its policy of peace, demands that the United Nations and the Security Council, as the main international institutions guaranteeing peace, abandon encouraging and protecting the American aggression in Korea, an aggression that the U.S. ruling circles insist on carrying out; and demands that the United Nations and the Security Council firmly embark on the road of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the road of restoring and maintaining peace.

	In Order for the Security Council to Fulfill its Mission of Peace, the Soviet Union Demands Immediate Recognition of Our Country's Representative

Of course, the Security Council can normally exercise its functions and fulfill the lofty tasks entrusted to it of maintaining peace and peaceful resolution, but this is only possible when its composition is fully legitimate and meets the requirements of the United Nations Charter—that is, with the participation of representatives from the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Only in this situation can resolutions passed by all five permanent members be legally valid. From the perspective of the United Nations Charter and generally accepted international standards, they are authoritative and indisputable.

In order to strictly abide by the United Nations Charter, the Soviet delegation demands immediate recognition of the representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as China's representative.

Unless this most important prerequisite is met, every resolution passed by any group of Security Council members is an illegal resolution, a forged resolution in violation of the United Nations Charter, and it has no international legal force or meaning whatsoever.

The experience of passing such resolutions on American aggression in Korea fully confirms this irrefutable proposition. These resolutions of the Security Council, passed under the instigation of the U.S. delegation in violation of the United Nations Charter, have no legal effect, these resolutions are determined according to the will of the aggressors, seeking to cover up their aggression, and the purpose of these resolutions is by no means to consolidate the cause of peace.

The Security Council must fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to it by the United Nations Charter of maintaining peace and peaceful resolution. It can only fulfill these responsibilities when it urgently and without hesitation begins to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

The Soviet delegation firmly advocates that the Security Council take this path—the path of peace and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Only this path fully conforms to the United Nations Charter and receives the full support of all peace-loving countries in the world.

The Soviet delegation firmly advocates including the two issues it has proposed on the Security Council's agenda, opposes including the destructive and aggressive suggestions proposed by the U.S. delegation on the agenda, and will vote against this suggestion."

### 在安理会八月三日会议上  苏代表马立克演说全文

　　在安理会八月三日会议上
    苏代表马立克演说全文
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社纽约五日电：在安理会八月三日的会议上，苏联代表马立克发言时宣称：“安理会会议不得不花费时间来讨论关于议程排列的程序问题，这已是第三天了，在这个议程的排列中，朝鲜问题将列入安理会的议程。
  苏联提出和平解决朝鲜问题  美国则坚持对朝鲜继续侵略
    在讨论过程中，对这一问题的两种相反的立场，已经清楚地形成了：究竟是为了和平的利益，抱着和平解决的目的来讨论这个问题，像苏联代表团目前所坚持的那样呢，还是抱着进一步使在朝鲜的军事行动继续下去，加紧美国政府对朝鲜人民的武装干涉，扩大这种侵略的范围与扩大这个战争的目的来讨论这个问题呢。
    美国代表所作的声明以及他所提出的建议的内容，说明了美国政府坚持继续并加紧侵略，并且想尽办法企图阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    美国政府已经从准备侵略的政策进入到直接和积极的侵略，现在正企图把联合国卷入它在朝鲜军事冒险的漩涡，其目的在于扩大并且加紧对朝鲜人民的侵略。
    苏联政府始终一贯不屈不挠地遵循着和平政策，并且把联合国当作和平的工具，现在它向安理会提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。
    苏联代表团奉苏联政府的训令把和平解决朝鲜问题的事项列入安理会议程，要求安理会紧急地而且毫不耽搁地讨论这个问题，并采取和平解决这个问题所必需的措施。
    然而美国代表团对苏联的建议反应如何呢？为了要阻挠讨论苏联的建议，美国政府训令它的代表团进行牵制活动：在苏联代表主持的八月一日安理会会议前夕，美国代表团匆匆提出它的提案，这就是它现在所建议的，安理会只考虑这个提案，而拒绝苏联所提把“承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表为中国代表”与“和平解决朝鲜问题”这两个问题列入安理会议程的建议。
    为了要阻碍考虑这两个以恢复并巩固朝鲜的和平以及恢复安理会的合法组成为目的紧急问题——因为没有中国的参加，安理会就不能被认为是在以其合法组成来执行它的职能，也就不能通过合法的决定——美国代表团在其提案中所建议的措施，其目的实质上是加紧在朝鲜的军事行动和扩大美国政府对朝鲜人民的侵略。
    美国代表及其英国同僚企图用“使冲突地方化”的辞令来掩饰这种建议的侵略本质。然而，这种辞令不过是被他们利用来掩盖美国的野心罢了。美国的野心是要加紧侵略朝鲜，增派军队与军火，把其他国家的武装部队牵入对朝鲜人民作战的漩涡，借以扩大军事行动的规模，加紧美国飞机对朝鲜和平城镇与乡村的野蛮恐怖的空袭，增加朝鲜平民的伤亡人数。
    翻开英美帝国主义的历史来看，“使冲突地方化”和“绥靖”这些词句的不祥的含义是谁都知道的。
    美国代表团依靠这种无耻的手段，正企图阻挠安理会考虑朝鲜问题的和平解决。所以，苏联代表团提请安理会考虑的问题和美国代表团提出的建议之间，存在着基本上的不同点。苏联代表团提出讨论关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，这个题目本身就说明了苏联政府谋求和平以及通过安理会来取得和平解决的意愿。
        南朝鲜发动进攻证据确凿  而且是由美国挑起和预谋
    美国政府坚持将它的提案列入议程，并企图给这个提案按上一个虚构的名称—“控诉对大韩民国侵略案”，它企图隐藏美国对朝鲜人民的侵略；用片面的、美国式的、故意虚构的说法来解说朝鲜事件的爆发与发展，想这样来迷惑联合国和国际舆论；把朝鲜事件爆发的罪名，加在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府身上。
    不过，无可置辩的材料与事实已经证明：六月二十五日开始的朝鲜事件，是南朝鲜当局的军队向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国边境地区发动挑拨性进攻所引起的。
    在苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯所作的苏联政府的声明中，提出了正式的言论与确凿的事实，向全世界证明了这次进攻是依照一个早已预谋和准备好的计划，在美国军事顾问的领导和直接参加之下，事先为美国高级官员——国防部长詹逊、美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷和国务院顾问杜勒斯——所知道，而且也不是没有得到他们的同意而发动的。
    没有再叙述和引证这些事实的必要了。我只想请安理会各位理事注意六月二十六日——朝鲜事件爆发的第二日——英美报纸所发表的一张照片。这张暴露真相的照片显示着不是别人，正是美国国务院的正式顾问杜勒斯、美国驻南朝鲜“大使”缪锡俄与美国军事顾问们，和李承晚傀儡政权的南朝鲜军队军官们一起站在三八线以南的战壕中。大概没有任何安理会的理事会以为杜勒斯与缪锡俄是在壕沟里采紫罗兰吧。一点也不是，杜勒斯是在那里从事于更乏味一些、更符合于他这个战争贩子癖好的事情。杜勒斯后来的谈话，证明了他是挑起朝鲜事件的主要挑拨者之一。这张照片证明了美国的侵略朝鲜是久已预谋的计划所产生的结果。前李承晚政府内务长官、四十八个前南朝鲜“国民议会”议员，和李承晚军队的许多军官们，在他们的谈话中都证实了进攻北朝鲜是经过预先的计划，在今年六月二十五日破晓时奉李承晚命令发动的，李承晚在这以前曾接到麦克阿瑟的命令，要他准备和实施“北伐”计划。
  就国际的和法律的观点看来  美国是对朝鲜直接武装侵略
    美国统治集团挑拨他们的南朝鲜傀儡对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的边界地区发动武装进攻之后，他们就赶忙利用这次挑拨来为他们久已预谋和准备的对朝鲜人民的武装侵略辩护。
    每一个多多少少客观的人都明白，朝鲜内战是在南朝鲜人与北朝鲜人之间进行的。
    朝鲜人——北方人与南方人——之间的敌对行动，其性质是国内战争，是内战。因此绝没有任何根据可以认为这些敌对行动是侵略。举凡一国明显地向另一国进攻，即构成侵略行为。自从一九三三年苏联代表团在日内瓦军缩会议的安全问题委员会上提出侵略定义以来，苏联政府在侵略定义的问题上就一直坚持这个立场。
    对于一个确定谁是应负进攻之责的一方，谁是进攻者与侵略者的国际机构来说，这个定义是具有指导意义的。
    如所周知，根据这个定义，凡一国向另一国宣战，一国的武装部队侵犯另一国的领土（即使是未经宣战），一国武装部队轰炸另一国领土等等，均被视为侵略。
    按照这个定义，任何政治战略或经济的理由，都不能作为实行进攻的口实。
    拒绝承认受攻击国的领土有足以表示它是一个国家的任何特征，也不能作为侵略的借口。革命或反革命的运动，内战，以及在任何国家中建立或保存一种或另一种政治、经济或社会制度，都不能作为进攻的借口。
    这个关于侵略及进攻方面，亦即关于侵略者的定义，大体上是一九三三年五月国际联盟安全问题委员会所通过的，该委会是由十七国的代表所组成。必须特别指出，而且安理会也必须注意这一情况，即上述委员会的组织包括目前为安理会理事国的若干国家，即：苏联、美国、英国、法国和挪威。因此，现为安理会理事的五个国家，曾通过他们的代表而接受了上述关于侵略及侵略者定义的国际宣言。
    但由于某些国家的迟延，这件事在一九三九年时尚未结束，而那时战争已经爆发了。从上述宣言中所包含的国际的、法律的标准及定义的观点看来，美国政府对朝鲜人民的军事行动，已构成了直接的武装侵略，美国政府是进攻方面，也即侵略者。
    美国虽然没有正式宣战，但是派遣武装部队侵入了朝鲜领土。上述的宣言认为这样的行为就是侵略。
    美国的陆、海、空部队正继续轰炸朝鲜的领土，攻击朝鲜的船只与空军。根据上述宣言，这样的行动即构成了侵略行为，美国是进攻的国家；也即是侵略者。
    美国的陆军、海军陆战队、空军部队已在朝鲜领土上登陆，并正在该地对目前处于内战状态下的朝鲜人民从事军事行动。美国的这一行动构成了侵略行为。
    美国已在海上封锁朝鲜的海岸与港口。根据上述宣言，这些行动构成了侵略行为。
    美国正企图以所谓“战略上的理由”来作为它对朝鲜侵略的口实；打算把它的国防线从它本国的边境尽可能远地伸展出去，硬说这是为了“国家安全”的目的。
    这种解释是毫无理由的，决不能用来作为美国侵略朝鲜人民的借口，这难道还不明显吗？根据上述侵略一词的定义，这种行动构成了直接侵略的行为。
    这个定义直截了当地说：并不能用政治、战略或经济性质的理由作为侵略的口实。
    因此，依照上述宣言中关于侵略一词的解释来审查美国政府在朝鲜的行动，就无可争辩地证明一件事实，即：美国政府已干涉了同一个国家二派之间在朝鲜的内战，并已因而对朝鲜人民进行了武装干涉。
    至于北朝鲜人与南朝鲜人之间所进行的战争，这是一国之内的内战，而不合于侵略的定义，因为战争不是在两个国家之间进行，而是在暂时分裂为两个政府阵营的两部分朝鲜人之间进行。
    所以说，朝鲜的冲突是国内冲突。侵略的定义不能适用于南朝鲜人或北朝鲜人，正如当美国南方人和北方人为了统一他们的国家进行内战时，侵略的定义不能适用于他们一样。众所周知，在那个时候，侵略者的角色是由英国所扮演的，那时英国曾企图干涉内战，阻碍美国南北的统一，正如现在它与美国一起正在干涉朝鲜的内战，企图阻碍那个国家的统一一样。
    中国的情形也是一样，众所周知，在那里蒋介石集团与北方的人民解放运动之间的斗争向未被视为侵略。有鉴于此，各外国都避免干涉这个国内冲突，避免干涉这个内战。
    从这一切可以得出结论：在朝鲜仅有的侵略者，就是那些在朝鲜领土上驻扎有军队并干涉北方人与南方人之间的斗争，从而扩大军事行动范围的国家。
    所以，在朝鲜，一方面有北朝鲜人与南朝鲜人之间的国内冲突——内战——，另一方面有美利坚合众国政府以武装侵略的形式对这个朝鲜内战的武装干涉，这完全符合国际联盟安全问题委员会（由十七个国家的代表所组成，有美利坚合众国代表参加）在一九三三年五月所通过的侵略定义宣言中所下的侵略定义。
    如所周知，联合国宪章也明白禁止联合国干涉任何国家的内政，只要争论中的问题是同一国家内，同一民族内两个集团间的冲突。
    按照这一原则，联合国宪章规定，只有当争论中的问题涉及国际性质而非国内性质的事件时，安全理事会才能出面干涉。
    这就是朝鲜问题和美国武装侵略朝鲜人民一事的本质，以及事情的实况。
    因此，全世界人民和联合国目前就面临着这样的事实：一方面是美国政府对朝鲜进行公开的武装侵略，另一方面是美国企图把联合国拖入这次侵略事件里。
  苏联要求联合国坚决维持和平  放弃鼓励和庇护美国侵略朝鲜
    美国政府老早就在蓄意准备侵略朝鲜，因此从本年一月起一直阻挠着中国参加安全理事会问题的正规解决，正因为如此，所以中国还不能经由其唯一合法的政府——中华人民共和国中央人民政府——在安全理事会里占有一席，这就使得苏联代表也不可能出席理事会的会议。
    美利坚合众国趁着安全理事会两个常任理事国——苏联和中国——不在安全理事会的时机，在理事会里以自己的意志指使它的军事政治同盟国，以发生了火警似的急急忙忙的态度，强使安全理事会通过了若干非法和可耻的决议，这一方面是要散布烟幕，掩盖美国对朝鲜人民的侵略，另一方面是企图把其他国家也卷入这次战争中，尽力煽起朝鲜和远东的战火。
    美国政府所挑起的局部性的朝鲜内部冲突，不仅立即被利用为军事干涉朝鲜内政的借口，而且也被利用来掩盖其在亚洲广大地域上——从朝鲜和日本海岸一直到越南——扩张侵略的活动，掩盖其对中国、越南和菲律宾人民的内部事务的干涉。这是众所周知的事实，美国无论是通过它的官方途径或是由美国对外政治宣传的系统——臭名远扬的“美国之音”——这样广泛地滥肆宣传的那些无论怎样片面捏造的滥言，都不能驳倒这些事实。这些事实既不能被麦克阿瑟将军仓促拼凑起来的公报所驳倒。也不能被美国在安全理事会的代表的程序诡计所驳倒。美国政府正企图把麦克阿瑟将军的公报，冒充为美国政府自己关于美国军事侵略朝鲜的进程的“报告”来提交安理会。
    由于美国武装侵略朝鲜，因此在安理会和联合国组织面前便摆着两条路——和平的道路和战争的道路。安理会必须选择：到底它要把更大批的人力和物质资源投入战争而使战争继续扩大呢，还是坚决转向和平，遵循和平解决的道路，像世界上一切爱好和平的民族所要求于安理会的那样。而世界上一切爱好和平的民族是由苏联领导，由苏联的领袖和天才的导师伟大斯大林所领导的。
    美利坚合众国的统治集团正在把安理会和联合国拖上战争的道路。他们渴望建立世界霸权，长久以来，他们就已经走上了侵略政策的道路。现在，他们已进而采取直接侵略的行动，竟狂妄地向爱好和平的朝鲜人民采取粗暴的侵略行为，走上直接干涉朝鲜内政的道路，力图借武装干涉来阻止朝鲜人民实现他们建立自由、统一与独立的朝鲜国家这一个多年以来的梦想与希望。
    美国政府既已使本国愈来愈牵连在朝鲜战事中，现在又正在努力使他国政府，首先是殖民国家——英国及其自治领、法国和荷兰——的统治集团卷入战争，力图强迫他们共同武装侵略朝鲜人民，并加紧侵略正在为自由与民族独立而斗争的其他亚洲各国人民。
    苏联，为了忠实于它的和平政策，要求作为保证和平的主要国际机构的联合国和安理会放弃鼓励和庇护美国在朝鲜的侵略，这种侵略，是美国统治集团坚执进行的；并要求联合国和安理会坚决地走上和平解决朝鲜问题的道路，走上恢复和维持和平的道路。
  为了安理会能履行和平任务  苏联要求立即承认我国代表
    当然，安理会能够正常运用其职能并履行委托给它的维持和平以及和平解决的崇高任务，但这只有当它的成分是充分合法的，符合于联合国宪章的要求。——这就是说有苏联和中华人民共和国代表参加的情形下才有可能。只有在这种情形之下，以它五个常任理事国全体参加所通过的决议，才有合法的效力。从联合国宪章和为一般所接受的国际标准的观点看来，才是权威性的和无可争辩的。
    为了严格遵照联合国宪章，苏联代表团要求立即承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表为中国的代表。
    除非具备了这个最重要的先决条件，否则安理会理事国任何集团所通过的每一决议，都是非法的决议，是违反联合国宪章的伪造的决议，它丝毫没有国际的法定力量和意义。
    通过关于美国在朝鲜侵略的这种议决案的经验，充分证实了这个无可辩驳的命题。安全理事会在美国代表团的主使下所通过的这些违反联合国宪章的决议，是没有法律效力的，它们这些决议是按侵略者的意愿而决定的，希图借此掩盖他们的侵略，这些决议的目的绝不是巩固和平事业。
    安全理事会必须执行联合国宪章所委托给它的维持和平与和平解决的责任。只有当它急迫地与毫不迟疑地开始和平解决朝鲜问题时，它才能执行这些责任。
    苏联代表团坚主安全理事会采取这个途径——和平与和平解决朝鲜问题的途径。只有这种途径，才完全符合联合国宪章，并获得世界所有爱好和平国家的完全支持。
    苏联代表团坚主在安全理事会议程中列入它所提的两个问题，反对在议程中列入美国代表团所提的破坏性与侵略性的建议，并将投票反对这一建议。”
