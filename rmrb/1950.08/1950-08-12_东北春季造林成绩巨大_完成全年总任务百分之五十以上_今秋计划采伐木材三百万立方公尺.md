Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 10th: Northeast China has achieved great success in spring afforestation this year. The entire region planted over 53,433,300 tree saplings and sowed over 14,200 seeds, with a total afforestation area of over 111,800 mu and over 800 kilometers of shelterbelts, completing 56.6% of the total annual task. Local governments, in light of different geographical environments, have been leading the people to carry out afforestation in a planned and focused manner. In the provinces of Rehe, Liaoxi, and the western part of Jilin Province, the focus is on building forests for wind prevention, water control, and sand control. Liaoxi Province alone planted over 8,998,800 trees for wind prevention this year. In the northeastern regions of Liaodong, Jilin, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces, the emphasis is on planting resource forests and bank protection forests.

During this spring's tree planting, the masses in various regions participated enthusiastically. Liaoxi Province adopted a collective afforestation approach, with over 250,000 people participating in tree planting across the province. Most areas of the province also organized forest protection teams, established agreements, and assigned responsibility by section. Tree planting in various regions generally exceeded the assigned tasks. The Lushun-Dalian area exceeded its annual tree planting task by more than double in the spring alone. Liaoxi and Songjiang provinces also completed 60% to 70% of their provincial tasks. Under the slogan "Plant one, make one live," the survival rate of newly planted trees in various regions is generally high, with Dalian City achieving a tree survival rate of 94%.

Based on the afforestation needs of various regions, tree nursery work has been restored this spring on the basis of the existing foundation. According to statistics, the entire region has restored 179 nurseries, with a nursery bed area of 3,770 mu, producing approximately 320 million saplings. Nurseries in various regions are now continuing to step up seedling cultivation to welcome this autumn's tree planting campaign.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 9th: Northeast China plans to cut down 3.6 million cubic meters of timber this autumn. This plan has been discussed and finalized at a recent meeting held by the Northeast Forest Industry Management Bureau and approved by the Economic Planning Commission of the Northeast People's Government. The meeting also discussed the operating methods and production processes of forest harvesting. The meeting decided that this year, the tree stump height should be left at no more than 20 centimeters (as opposed to the previous regulation of no more than 30 centimeters). 42% of the timber transported should be transported using ice roads to reduce transportation costs and improve transportation efficiency. The meeting also decided to change the previous method of simultaneous logging and transportation and implement autumn logging and winter transportation. Logging operations should be entirely carried out by forestry workers, which can reduce many chaotic and wasteful phenomena. In order to complete the above logging tasks, various regions will train over 3,000 forest harvesting cadres in August to welcome this autumn's large-scale logging work.

　　东北春季造林成绩巨大
    完成全年总任务百分之五十以上
    今秋计划采伐木材三百万立方公尺
    【新华社沈阳十日电】东北今年春季植树造林工作获得很大成绩，全区共植树苗五千三百四十三万三千余棵，另播种籽一万四千二百余粒，造林面积共达十一万一千八百余亩又八百余公里，已完成全年总任务的百分之五十六点六。各地人民政府针对不同地理环境领导人民有计划有重点地造林。在热河、辽西两省及吉林省西部地区，多着重造防风、治水、防沙等林。辽西省今年仅造防风林即达八百九十九万八千余棵。辽东、吉林、松江三省和黑龙江的东北地区，则着重栽植资源林和护岸林。
    今春植树中，各地群众参加的极为踊跃，辽西省采用了集体造林的办法，全省参加造林的人数在二十五万人以上。该省大部地区并组织了护林小组，订立公约，分段负责。各地植树一般均超过任务。旅大地区仅春季植树即超过全年任务一倍多。辽西、松江两省亦完成了全省任务百分之六十至七十。在“栽一棵，活一棵”的口号下，各地新植树木成活率一般均高，大连市植树成活率达到百分之九十四。
    根据各地造林需要，今春树木育苗工作已在旧有的基础上恢复起来。据统计：全区共恢复苗圃一百七十九处，苗床面积三千七百七十亩，苗木生产约三亿二千余万棵。各地苗圃现正继续抓紧育苗，以迎接今年秋季的植树造林运动。
    【新华社沈阳九日电】东北计划今年秋季采伐木材三百六十万立方公尺。此项计划已在东北森林工业管理总局最近召开的会议上讨论确定，并经东北人民政府经济计划委员会批准。会议并讨论了森林采伐的作业方法和生产过程等问题。会议决定今年各地将伐根留到二十公分以下（按去年规定为不超过三十公分），占百分之四十二的运搬木材，应采取冰道运搬的方法，以便减少运输费用，提高搬运效率。会议并决定改变去年采伐运搬同时并进的办法，实行秋季采伐，冬季运搬。采伐工作应全部由林业工人参加，这样可以减少许多混乱和浪费现象。为了完成上述采伐任务，各地将在八月份训练三千余名采伐森林的干部，以迎接今秋大规模的采伐工作。
