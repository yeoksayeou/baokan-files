Implementing the Resolutions of the National Match Industry Conference
    The Match Industry Begins to Move Towards Planned Production
    Production and Sales Gradually Achieve Balance; Product Specifications Have Been Basically Unified
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Reporter Feng Zhong reports: After the National Match Industry Conference, various regions, based on the production tasks assigned by the conference, began to shift from blind development to planned production. The production and sales of matches in various regions have gradually become balanced, the selling price has risen above the cost, and match manufacturers have been able to obtain reasonable profits to maintain production. Product quality generally has certain specifications. In the past, the anarchic state of match industry production nationwide was very serious. The maximum production capacity of matches nationwide could reach more than 150,000 boxes per month, but before the Match Conference, the monthly production volume was about 77,000 boxes, while the actual consumption volume was about 50,000 boxes, resulting in a surplus of match production nationwide. Because match industries in various regions competed for the market and engaged in price-cutting sales, several factories were forced to shut down due to losses. Taking Tianjin as an example, only three of the sixteen public and private match factories in Tianjin have continued to operate. To adjust the relationship between match production and sales, the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central Government convened the National Match Industry Conference in June of this year. After careful discussion, it was decided that the national monthly production volume for the second half of this year would be reduced to 48,780 boxes. The conference also specifically assigned production tasks to major administrative regions and formulated unified quality standards.

    Since July of this year, the industrial departments of major administrative regions across the country have begun to implement the resolutions of the Match Conference, restricting the establishment of new factories and stopping the expansion of existing factory equipment. They have also successively or are currently allocating specific production tasks to various provinces and cities in a negotiated manner, based on the principles of giving consideration to both public and private interests, supporting progress, taking care of the overall situation, and considering history, as decided by the conference. Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Tianjin, Beijing, and other provinces and cities have also specifically allocated production tasks to various public and private match factories to carry out planned production. However, it has been quite difficult to allocate specific production figures. Match industries in various regions have experienced more or less competition for quotas. Industrial departments in various regions generally use democratic consultation, symposiums, formal meetings, and other methods to persuade various units to abandon departmentalism and reach agreements based on the overall and long-term interests of the match industry and on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual understanding. Among them, the Central South region, in order to adjust the peak and off-peak months of the match season, has also decided on the principle of flexible quotas, but the increase or decrease in production should not exceed 20% of the allocated quota, and the average production for six months should still meet the allocated quota.

    Production and Sales Approach Balance; Selling Prices Have Become More Reasonable
    After the initial implementation of planned production in the national match industry, the production and sales situation immediately improved. In July, match selling prices in various regions generally increased. Taking the Tianjin market situation as an example, at the end of July, match prices were up by a little less than 23% (safety matches) to a little less than 25% (phosphorus sulfide matches) compared to June 1. The selling price of Shanghai's "Beauty" brand matches at the end of July was up 33% compared to June 1. The selling price has begun to stabilize from below cost to a reasonable level above cost, and match factories have been able to obtain appropriate profits to continue to maintain production. In the past two months, about half of the matches that had been stockpiled across the country have been sold, and in individual cities such as Beijing, basically all of the stockpiled inventory has been sold. At the beginning of the close of the National Match Industry Conference, some speculators mistakenly believed that the future supply of matches would not meet demand and implemented hoarding and speculation. However, because the actual production and sales of matches have approached equilibrium, and the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central Government can adjust the production and sales relationship in various regions when necessary, the speculative behavior of individual merchants has not triggered a sharp rise in match prices. There are also some match factories that only see the current smooth sales of matches and demand increased production, failing to understand that this is only a temporary phenomenon.

    Unify Match Specification Standards; Stop the Production of Yellow Phosphorus Matches
    According to the match specification standards stipulated by the Match Conference, except for individual regions that take care of the semi-finished products stockpiled by a few factories, products in various regions generally have certain specifications, and the manufacture of yellow phosphorus matches that endanger health and safety has been stopped. When the Northwest Match Industry Conference discussed the issue of banning yellow phosphorus matches, some representatives deliberately distorted the fact that yellow phosphorus matches are suitable for the needs of farmers, and, using the excuse of "serving the masses," wanted to retain backward technology. Some individual representatives even denied the harm of yellow phosphorus to consumers and raised objections. After mutual criticism and explanation among colleagues, they realized that the manufacture of yellow phosphorus matches directly affects health, and finally unanimously supported the decision of the National Match Industry Conference to ban yellow phosphorus matches.

    Regarding the issue of unemployed workers that came with the reduction in match production, various regions are carefully handling it separately based on specific circumstances, with the industrial departments consulting with local labor bureaus and trade unions. The handling of unemployed workers in Tianjin, Shanxi, and other places has basically been completed. The largest public-owned China Match Factory in Tianjin, with more than 1,300 employees, laid off a total of 459 people, all of whom were introduced by the Municipal Industrial Bureau to change careers or enter training classes to study. The principle for private match factories to dismiss workers is: take into account technology and seniority, first dismiss surplus personnel, and pay severance pay of one and a half to three months' salary based on the length of service. Unemployed workers are assisted by the Labor Bureau in conjunction with the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee.

    The employees of the larger match factories in Beijing, in the spirit of "three people eating the food of five," have decided to implement the "three-two shift system" proposed by the workers themselves, dividing the workers into three groups, each working for twenty days and resting for ten days. Although workers earn slightly less wages, the number of unemployed people can be reduced.

    Strictly Supervise the Implementation of Resolutions; Eliminate the Phenomenon of Disconnection Between Production and Sales
    To ensure the full realization of the resolutions of the National Match Industry Conference, industrial departments in various regions have assumed the responsibility of supervising implementation. Under the assistance of the Tianjin Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, the seven match factories in Tianjin decided to organize a joint management committee to be responsible for inspecting the quality of finished products, improving production technology, agreeing on prices, collectively purchasing raw materials, promoting the sales of finished products, and ensuring production according to production tasks. Before the official establishment of the joint management committee, public and private factories jointly formulated a production covenant, stipulating that the production figures of each factory shall not be privately transferred or increased or decreased by each other, earnestly implementing the specification standards stipulated by the National Match Industry Conference, and stipulating penalties. In addition, the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central Government has sent letters to trade departments and tax authorities in various regions to assist in the work, such as the trade departments' control over the source of raw materials and the tax authorities' control over tax tickets for match goods, which also plays a very important role in ensuring match production tasks.

    Small match factories in various regions that have been allocated very few production tasks and have difficulty maintaining production should, as far as possible, implement joint management and joint production to reduce expenses. In addition, with the adjustment of match industry production, industries manufacturing match raw materials, such as phosphorus sulfide factories, stem-making and box material factories, etc., should also be appropriately adjusted. The Tianjin Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce has started to carry out this work.

　　贯彻全国火柴工业会议决议
    火柴工业开始走向计划生产
    产销渐趋平衡产品规格已基本统一
    【本报讯】记者冯仲报道：全国火柴工业会议之后，各地根据会议分配的生产任务，开始由盲目发展走向计划生产。各地火柴产销已渐趋平衡，售价上升至成本以上，火柴制造厂家已能获致合理利润，维持生产。产品质量一般已有一定规格。过去，全国火柴工业生产的无政府状态是非常严重的。全国火柴最大生产能力每月可达十五万余箱，但在火柴会议前，每月生产量约为七万七千余箱，而实际消耗量约为五万余箱，因之，在全国范围形成火柴生产过剩。由于各地火柴业互争市场，跌价倾销，致使若干厂家因亏本而歇业，以天津为例，天津公私营十六家火柴厂中，一直维持开工者只有三家工厂。为调整火柴产销关系，中央轻工业部于本年六月召开的全国火柴工业会议，经过慎重地讨论，决定本年下半年全国每月生产量减为四八七八○箱。会议上并具体分配了各大行政区生产任务，制订了统一的质量标准。
    本年七月起，全国各大行政区工业主管部门已开始执行火柴会议的决议，限制设立新厂，停止扩充现有各厂设备。并已先后或正在根据会议决定的公私兼顾、扶助进步、照顾全面、照顾历史等原则，以协商方式具体分配各省市的生产任务。河北、山西、平原、天津、北京等省市并已将生产任务，具体分配给各公私火柴厂家，进行计划生产。但在具体分配生产数字中是相当困难的，各地火柴业曾或多或少地发生争夺配额现象。各地工业主管部门一般地都通过民主协商、座谈会、正式会议等方式，以火柴工业整体和长远利益来说服各单位抛弃本位主义思想，在互助互谅的原则下达成协议。其中中南区为调剂火柴季节的淡旺月，并决定数额申缩原则，但所增减产量不得超过分配额百分之二十，六个月产量平均仍应符合分配额。
    产销接近平衡  售价已趋合理
    全国火柴工业初步实行计划生产后，产销情况随即好转。七月份各地火柴售价已普遍上提。以天津市场情况为例，七月底火柴价格较六月一日上升百分之二十三弱（安全火柴）到百分之二十五弱（硫化磷火柴）。上海美丽牌火柴售价七月底较六月一日上升百分之三十三。售价由成本以下提升至成本以上的合理程度已开始稳定，各火柴厂已能获致适当的利润，继续维持生产。两个月来，全国各地过去积压的火柴已销出约半数，个别城市如北京市基本上已全部售出积压的存货。在全国火柴会议闭幕之初，曾有部分投机商人错误地认为将来火柴产不敷销，而实行囤购惜售。但因实际火柴产销已接近平衡，且中央轻工业部于必要时又可调剂各地产销关系，故个别商人投机行为并未能激起火柴价格的暴涨。也有若干火柴厂只看到当前火柴销售顺利的情况，而要求增产，未了解这只是一时现象。
    统一火柴规格标准  停止黄磷火柴生产
    根据火柴会议所规定的火柴规格标准，除个别地区照顾少数工厂存积的半成品外，各地产品一般都有了一定的规格，并停止制造危害卫生安全的黄磷火柴。西北火柴业会议讨论禁制黄磷火柴问题时，部分代表曾故意歪曲黄磷火柴适合农民需要，借口“为群众服务”，欲保留落后技术，甚至有个别代表否认黄磷对消费者的危害性，提出反对意见。经过同业相互批评解释，才认识到制造黄磷火柴直接影响健康，最后一致拥护全国火柴工业会议禁制黄磷火柴的决定。
    随火柴减产俱来的失业工人问题，各地正分别根据具体情况，由工业主管部门会同当地劳动局、工会慎重处理。天津、山西等地对失业工人的处理已基本完毕。天津最大的一家有职工一千三百余人的公营中华火柴工厂共裁减四五九人，均由市工业局介绍转业或入训练班学习。私营火柴厂解雇工人的原则是：照顾技术、厂龄，先解雇过剩冗员，按厂龄长短发给一个半月至三个月工资的解雇费，失业工人由劳动局会同失业工人救济委员会救济。
    北京较大的火柴工厂职工，本着三个人饭五个人吃的精神，已决定实行工人自动提出的“三二轮班制”，将工人分成三批，每批工作二十天，休息十天，工人虽略少得工资，但可减少失业人数。
    严格监督决议执行  消灭产销脱节现象
    为保证全国火柴会议决议的全部实现，各地工业主管部门已负起监督执行之责。天津市七个火柴工厂在天津市工商局帮助下，决定组织联营委员会，负责检查成品质量，改进生产技术，协议价格，集体采购原料，推销成品和保证按生产任务生产。在联营委员会正式成立前，各公私工厂又共同订立了生产公约，规定各厂生产数字不得私自转让或彼此增减，认真执行全国火柴工业会议规定的规格标准，并规定了惩罚办法。此外中央轻工业部已函请各地贸易部门，税务机关协助工作，如贸易部门在原料来源方面的掌握，税务机关对火柴货物税票的控制等，对保证火柴生产任务也起非常重要的作用。
    各地若干小型火柴厂分到的生产任务很少，维持生产有困难者，应尽可能实行联营，共同生产以减少开支。此外，随火柴工业生产的调整，制造火柴原料的工业如硫化磷厂，制梗及盒料厂等也应作适当的调整，天津市工商局已着手进行这一工作。
