　　To Adapt to Production Needs After Price and Currency Stability
    Northeast Bank Further Reduces Interest Rates
    And Decides to Abolish Physical Commodity Deposit Method
    [Our Newspaper, Shenyang News] Correspondent Xiao Rixin reports: In view of the greater stability of prices and currency value in the Northeast region this year, and to adapt to the current deposit and loan situation, the head office of Northeast Bank, with the approval of the Northeast People's Government, will further reduce interest rates from August and abolish the physical commodity deposit method.
    The interest rates revised this time are generally reduced by one-half compared to the past in terms of lending. The specific regulations are as follows: (1) The monthly interest rate for short-term credit to settlement units is 2.4% before participating in settlement, and 0.27% after participating in settlement, a reduction of nearly nine-tenths. This is 0.3% less than the current interest rate for general current deposits (0.3%). (2) The original stipulation for short-term loans to state-owned enterprises within three months was a monthly interest rate of 0.3%, which is now changed to 0.09% to 0.12%. Even calculated at the highest rate of 0.12%, this is nearly two-thirds lower than the original regulation. (3) The original stipulation for short-term loans to cooperatives within three months was a monthly interest rate of 0.24%, which is now changed to 0.09%; for those over three months, the past rate was 0.39%, which is now changed to 0.12%. (4) In the past, agricultural loans to organized farmers were 0.12%, which is now changed to 0.09%; in the past, loans to unorganized individual farmers were 0.15%, which is now changed to 0.12%. (5) In the past, loans to private industrial and commercial enterprises were all 0.36%. Now, loans to private industrial enterprises within three months are changed to 0.12% to 0.18%, and loans to private commercial enterprises are changed to 0.15% to 0.21%.
    Deposit interest rates have also been appropriately revised. However, in order to attract deposits and encourage savings, the reductions are not large, or the status quo is temporarily maintained.
    Although interest rates have been reduced, Northeast Bank's handling of the original deposit and loan interest is also quite considerate of the interests of depositors or borrowers. For example, for general depositors' fixed-term deposits (excluding government agencies, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives) before August, even if they mature after August, the bank will still calculate the interest at the original deposit rate and will not reduce it when they are withdrawn at maturity. For fixed-term loans, when borrowers repay at maturity, the interest rate before August will still be calculated at the original rate, and the new interest rate will be applied after August to reduce the interest burden on borrowers.
    In addition, in order to take care of the interests of private banks and money shops, their deposit and loan interest rates have also been approved by the government to be appropriately increased by about 50% based on the standards stipulated by the national banks, and specific regulations must be made after consultation with private banks and money shops.
    In addition, the Northeast Bank's past regular physical commodity deposits and wage fraction savings, which were intended to protect depositors' principal and interest from being affected by price fluctuations, are no longer necessary given the current stable price situation. Therefore, it has been decided to abolish the physical deposit method except for wage coupon savings. However, in order to take care of depositors in order to avoid losses due to high prices when they deposited in the past and low prices now, it was also decided that if prices were high when deposited and are now low, payment should be made in cash based on the original deposit amount, and interest should be paid as a current deposit. If the real price was low when deposited and is now high, payment will still be made in real terms as originally stipulated, which will be handled according to the principle of voluntary participation by depositors.

　　适应物价币值稳定后生产需要
    东北银行再度降低利率
    同时决定取消实物存款办法
    【本报沈阳讯】通讯员萧日新报道：东北银行总行鉴于东北地区今年物价与币值更加稳定，并为适应目前存放款情况需要，经呈请东北人民政府批准，从八月份起，再度降低利率，并取消实物存款办法。
    这次修正的利率，放款方面一般均比过去降低二分之一，具体规定如：（一）对结算单位之短期信贷，在未参加结算前为月息二分四，参加结算后，即改为二厘七，降低了将近十分之九。比现在吸收一般的活期存款利率（三厘）还少三毫。（二）对公营企业三个月以内的短期放款原规定为月息三分，现改为九厘至一分二厘。以最高一分二厘计算还比原规定降低近三分之二。（三）对合作社三个月以内的短期放款，原规定为月息二分四，现改为九厘，三个月以上者过去是三分九厘，现改为一分二厘。（四）农业贷款过去贷给有组织的农民是一分二厘，现改为九厘；过去贷给无组织的个体农民是一分五，现改为一分二厘。（五）对私营工商业放款过去均为三分六，现私营工业三个月以内的贷款改为一分二至一分八，私营商业改为一分五至二分一厘。
    存款息方面，也作了适当的修正。但为吸收存款及奖励储蓄起见，降低不大或暂时维持现状。
    利率虽然降低了，但东北银行对原来存放款利息的处理办法，也相当的照顾到存户或贷款户的利益。如对八月份以前的一般存户之定期性存款（机关、公营企业、合作社除外），虽于八月以后到期，于到期领取时，银行仍按原存时之利率计算不予降低。对于贷出之定期性放款，借户于到期偿还时，八月以前仍按原利率计算，八月以后就改按新利率计算，以减少借户的利息负担。
    又为照顾到私营银行钱庄的利益，对其存放款利率亦得到政府的同意，准按国家银行规定标准，酌情增加百分之五十左右，并须与私营行庄进行协商后再作具体的规定。
    此外，东北银行过去为使存户保本生息不受物价波动影响所举办的定期实物存款及工薪折分储蓄，依照目前物价稳定情况，已无继续存在的必要，因此决定除工薪券储蓄外，取消折实存款办法。但为照顾存户因过去存入时物价高，现在物价低，到期支付免受损失起见，同时决定了如存入时物价高现在低了得按原存金额折合现金支付，并按活期性存款付给利息。如存入时折实物价低，而现在高了，仍按原规定折实付给，由存款人采取自愿的原则办理。
