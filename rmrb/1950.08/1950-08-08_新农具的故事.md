The Story of New Farm Tools
    Yu Changqin
  (I)
    On January 8th, the Communist Party branch secretary of Donggu Village, who was undergoing training in Shulan County, Jilin Province, called the Sun Shaoyan mutual aid group in the village and said: "Please send someone from your group to Shenyang immediately to collect the machines...." In fact, the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry invited several better mutual aid group leaders to attend a symposium and learn to use new-style horse-drawn agricultural machinery in order to focus on the trial use of new-style agricultural machinery among farmers. The Sun Shaoyan group was one of those invited.
    When the young members of Sun Shaoyan's group heard the news, they scrambled to go and collect the "machines," so they had to use a democratic decision-making method. As a result, Sun Shaoyan, Zhu Baoxing, and Li Kuiyi were selected. Sun Shaoyan was the group leader, so he naturally had to go; Zhu Baoxing was the only "craftsman" in the whole group and was also quick-witted, so he had to go; Li Kuiyi was young and had a good memory, so he would be useful if he went. The three of them could go together to "consult carefully" so that they wouldn't be confused when something happened. When they were about to leave, people repeatedly told Zhu Baoxing: "You are the only one in our group who knows a little about machines, so you can't be vague. If you learn it, we will all learn from you...."
  (II)
    After Sun Shaoyan and the other two left, people eagerly awaited the arrival of the machines. On January 21st, Sun Shaoyan actually brought back fifteen large carts, pulling fifteen large boxes. As soon as they entered the street, someone shouted: "The machines are here!" Old and young, men and women, rushed to see the sight. Everyone worked together to open the box lids: each box was filled with seven-pronged and eight-branched iron gadgets painted in red and blue. People asked Zhu Baoxing to "install them quickly."
    Although Zhu Baoxing carefully memorized the structure of the new-style farm tools when he visited them in Shenyang, he felt a bit overwhelmed when faced with this pile of disassembled parts. Fortunately, he found two books in one of the boxes. But the snow-white paper was full of curved and twisted horizontal characters, and Zhu Baoxing didn't recognize this "Russian," and it took him a long time to understand some of the pictures in the book. So he followed them and matched the pieces one by one, matching them wrong and re-matching them. Finally, he assembled a cannon-like machine. At this time, it so happened that the Northeast People's Government sent a technical instructor, who said he was specifically helping to guide the assembly and use of the machines, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. So they assembled all the machines according to the entire production process, from the double-wheeled single-furrow plow and seeder used for spring plowing to the harvester and thresher used for autumn harvesting, neatly arranged in three spacious tile-roofed houses, looking like a small exhibition.
    After the new-style farm tools arrived home, people came to visit every day. Zhu Baoxing patiently explained the name, purpose, and advantages of each farm tool compared to the old tools. Those who listened were both happy and doubtful. They were happy because it was the first time they had seen such novel gadgets! They were doubtful because these gadgets didn't look like plows at all, and they were afraid they couldn't cultivate the land. Some old people even said: "Our ancestors have been using plows to cultivate the land for generations, so why can't we do it now?..." Sun Shaoyan, Zhu Baoxing, and others were initially confident, but after hearing so much of this discussion, they also felt a little hesitant. But they also thought: "The government is only seeking welfare for us, how could they fool us?" Therefore, they continued to explain: "If you don't believe it, look at the fields!"
  (III)
    After the new farm tools arrived home, they also caused many new problems within the mutual aid group. "What to do if there is no wasteland to open up?" "How can we do it without contiguous land?" "What if disputes arise from breaking the land boundaries?" In response to this series of questions, the experienced group leader Sun Shaoyan calmly convened several meetings of the group members and enthusiastically launched democratic discussions. Before long, these new problems, which were prerequisites for using new-style farm tools, were all resolved satisfactorily.
    Sun Shaoyan personally ran to Donggu Village, more than eight miles away, and found a piece of land that had been left uncultivated for many years. It was decided that the land to be opened up would be democratically assessed according to the male and female labor force participating in production in the whole group, and the land rights would be determined. Sun Shaoyan and other Communist Party members also took the lead in taking out familiar land for trial use. After the land boundary was broken, a pit was dug at both ends and filled with cement to make gray piles as hidden boundaries. When planting, plant contiguously, and the seeds are distributed according to the land area. When harvesting, harvest separately according to the hidden boundaries, without mixing them. At the same time, the work of the groups was readjusted. In this way, everyone was very satisfied, laying an ideological foundation for the smooth use of new-style farm tools.
  (IV)
    On April 4th, the weather was clear and the village was noisy early in the morning, as if a festival was approaching. People heard that Zhu Baoxing and the technical instructor were going to use machines to plant wheat, so they all dropped their work and ran to watch. Old Man Li, who was over sixty years old, also put down his old plow and squeezed into the crowd to see what was going on. Zhu Baoxing was at the helm, and a young man was pulling the livestock. As the wheels on both sides turned, the wheat grains followed the rubber tube and fell into the new soil cut by the soil-dividing knife, and the iron ring at the back immediately covered the floating soil. Ten ridges of land were planted in one go; it was much better than the old plow! Everyone squatted down and pulled up the seeds in the soil, and exclaimed in surprise: "This gadget is easy to use! The sowing is even, and the depth of the soil cover is just right, it's really amazing."
    From then on, the people in the village had new discussions, saying, "Hearing is not believing, seeing is believing! The gadgets made by the Soviet elder brother are really not fake!" Since then, every time the Sun Shaoyan mutual aid group used a new farm tool (from the reclamation machine and seeder to the weeding machine used for summer hoeing), groups of people followed to watch, and there was always a new discussion, and almost no one said that this gadget was not good. — These discussions immediately spread to more than ten miles around, everyone praised, everyone envied, and men, women, old and young, all knew that the Sun Shaoyan mutual aid group used new farm tools to plant 138 mu of land this year, and also finished planting seven or eight days earlier than others, drawing out a lot of manpower and animal power to dig trenches for flood prevention, and also opened up more than 260 mu of wasteland. The seedlings of this mutual aid group are growing particularly well, the wheat is taller than others, and they will harvest more grain than others in the fall.

　　新农具的故事
    于长钦
  （一）
    一月八号，在吉林舒兰县里受训的东孤村中共支部书记，给村里孙绍岩互助组打来电话说：“请你们组立即派人以沈阳去领机器……。”其实，这是东北人民政府农林部为在农民中重点试用新式马拉机械农具，而邀请几个较好的互助组长去开座谈会并学用新式农具，孙绍岩组是被邀请的一个。
    孙绍岩组的年青的组员们听到这个消息，争着要去领“机器”，于是只好用民主决定的方法。结果推选了孙绍岩、朱宝兴、李奎一三个人去。孙绍岩是组长，自然要去的；朱宝兴是全组唯一的“匠人”、心眼又灵，也非去不可；李奎一年青记性好，去了也用得着。三个人同去，可以“好好参考”，不致于临事糊涂。当他们临走时，人们一次又一次地嘱咐朱宝兴：“咱组就你对机器通点路，可不能含糊，你去学会了，咱们都向你学……。”
  （二）
    孙绍岩等三人走后，人们都眼巴巴的盼着领来机器。一月二十一号，孙绍岩果然带着十五辆大车，拉回十五个大箱子。刚一进街，就有人喊：“机器到家了！”老的，少的，男的，女的，纷纷前来观景。大伙七手八脚的就把箱子盖揭开：每箱里面都满满地装着七杈八股的，刷着红蓝油漆的铁玩艺。人们要求朱宝兴“赶快安装起来”。
    朱宝兴虽然在沈阳参观新式农具时，用心地记了构造，可是面对这一堆一堆的大解八块的零件，实在有些发闷。幸巧在一个箱里发现了两本书。但雪白的纸上净是些弯弯扭扭的横字，朱宝兴不识这“俄文”，半天才理会些书上的图儿。就照着一块一块的往上对，对错了又重对，好容易装起一个炮车样的机器来。这时，恰好东北人民政府派来了个技术指导员，说是专门帮助指导装配和使用机器的，大家方才松了一口气。于是他们便按整个生产过程，从春耕用的双轮一铧犁、播种机到秋收用的收割机、脱壳机，都装配起来，整整齐齐的排列在三间宽敞的瓦房里，活象一个小型展览会。
    新式农具到家后，参观的人天天不断。朱宝兴耐心地解释着每件农具的名字、用途以及比旧家什有那些好处等。听了的人，又喜又疑。喜的是开天辟地，第一次看了新奇玩艺！疑的是这些玩艺一点也不象犁杖，只怕不能种地。有的老年人更说：“祖辈传流都使犁杖种地，现在就不行啦？………”孙绍岩、朱宝兴等人起初都有信心，但是听多了这些议论之后，心里也有点犹疑了。不过他们又想：“政府净为咱们谋福利，能够胡弄咱吗？”因此他们仍然继续解释：“你们不信，地里瞧吧！”
  （三）
    新农具到家后，也使互助组内部发生了不少新问题。“没有荒开怎么办？”“没有成片的地怎行？”“打破地界要发生纠纷怎么办？”针对这一连串的问题，有经验的组长孙绍岩沉着地召开了几次组员大会，热烈地展开了民主讨论。不多久，这些作为使用新式农具前提条件的新问题都一一获得了圆满解决。
    孙绍岩亲自跑到八里以外的东孤屯，找到了一片多年撩荒的地。决定开出的地，按全组参加生产的男女劳动力民主评定，确定地权。孙绍岩和其他的共产党员，又带头拿出熟地试用。地界打破后在两头挖一个坑，灌进洋灰作成灰橛为暗界。种时连片种，种籽按地面积出，收时按暗界分别割，概不混合。同时还重新调整了小组的工作。这样大家都很满意，为顺利使用新式农具奠定了思想基础。
  （四）
    四月四号，天气晴朗，村子里一清早就喧喧嚷嚷，象是临了什么节气。人们听得朱宝兴和技术指导员要用机器种小麦了，因此纷纷扔下自己的活，都跑去参观。六十多岁的老李头，也放下旧犁杖挤进人丛里来看个究竟。只见朱宝兴掌着舵，一个小伙子拉着牲口，两边的轱辘一转，麦粒就顺着胶皮管落到分土刀割开的新土里，后边的铁环马上就把浮土盖上，一来一往便种好了十垅地；比起旧犁来不知要强多少倍！大家都蹲下去扒了扒土里的种籽，惊奇地喊道：“这玩艺好使啊！撒种均匀，土盖的深浅正相当，真是了不起。”
    从此之后，村里的人们又有了新的议论，都说“耳听不相信，眼见才放心！苏联老大哥做的玩艺真不假！”从这次之后，孙绍岩互助组每使用一种新农具（自开荒机、播种机一直到夏锄用的锄草机），都有成群的人儿跟着看，也都有一番新的议论，几乎没有一个再说这玩艺不好的。——这些议论立即传遍了周围十多里，人人称赞，人人羡慕，男女老少都知道了孙绍岩互助组今年使用新农具种了一百三十八亩地，还比旁人提早七、八天结束播种，抽出许多人力畜力挖壕防水，并且开了二百六十余亩荒地。这互助组的苗子长得特别好，麦子比别人高一头，秋后还要比别人多打粮食哩。
