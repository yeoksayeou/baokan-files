　　Preparing to Conquer the Huai River's Downstream Floods
    Full Deployment Along the Northern Jiangsu Grand Canal
    [Our Dispatch] Comprehensive reports from the Northern Jiangsu Daily and correspondents: Ensuring the Hongze Lake Dam and the Grand Canal dikes after the Huai River flood flows downstream has become a serious task in the current flood prevention work in East China. If these two dikes are secured, more than 20 million mu of autumn crops along the banks of Gaoyou Lake and Baoying Lake can achieve a good harvest, which is also of great importance to the disaster relief work in northern Anhui this year. Currently, the people along the Northern Jiangsu Grand Canal dike and the Hongze Lake Dam, under the leadership of the local flood prevention headquarters, have fully launched defense work.
    The Northern Jiangsu Grand Canal is directly downstream of the Huai River. After the Huai River flood flows into Hongze Lake, most of it flows into the Yangtze River through the Grand Canal via Sanhe, Gaoyou Lake, and Baoying Lake, except for a small portion that flows eastward into the sea through the Zhangfu River. Currently, the Huai River flood has poured into Hongze Lake. On the 7th of this month, the water level at Yumatou in Gaoyou on the Grand Canal had reached 8.19 meters, only 0.27 meters away from the danger level. To this end, the East China Flood Control Headquarters called on the people along the river and lake in northern Jiangsu to ensure the dikes and fight against the floods. On July 27, it sent an inspection team to northern Jiangsu to assist the region in carrying out reinforcement projects and allocated an additional 15 million jin of rice as project funds. The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office also convened an emergency flood prevention meeting in Baoying on July 21, deciding that flood prevention is the overriding central task at present, to ensure the safety of the Hongze Lake Dam and the Grand Canal dike, consolidate the Xin沂 River embankment, and allocate more than 5.9 million jin of emergency project funds to support the reinforcement projects of the Grand Canal dike, Hong Lake Dam, Yancheng River, and Baima Lake embankments. At the same time, in order to facilitate flood discharge, it was decided to open the three old Jiang dams of Lanjiang, Bihu, and Chushan downstream of Yangzhou, emptying the waters of Gaobao Lake in advance to reduce the future burden on the Grand Canal.
    After the flood prevention work was deployed, various localities immediately launched intense flood prevention work. The Grand Canal dike has been divided into southern, central, and northern sections, with flood prevention headquarters set up separately. The Hong Lake Dam also established a separate headquarters. In terms of reinforcement projects: The Hong Lake Dam has many hidden dangers, and it is prepared to add 290,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The west dike of the Grand Canal along the Gaobao Lake line is prepared to add 190,000 tons of stones to make stone weirs, in case the Hong Lake Dam is not secured, so that the waves will not hit the east dike. At the same time, the east dike will be thickened, requiring the Grand Canal dike project to be able to defend against floods one meter higher than the water level in 1931. In terms of material preparation: In addition to sending more than 30 cadres to Jiangnan to purchase stone, wood, lead wire, sacks and other necessary materials for emergency repairs, the masses are also mobilized to raise materials themselves, conduct spot checks, registration, and centralization, etc., for emergency use. In terms of transportation and communication: It is planned to add ten telephones to the dangerous sections of the southern section of the canal, and install electric lights along the dike to prepare for emergency repairs in windy, rainy, and dark nights. The Northern Jiangsu District Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Administrative Office, and the Military Region Command also plan to extract four trucks and ten horses as transportation and communication tools when necessary. In addition, the three old Jiang dams of Lanjiang, Bihu, and Chushan, which were opened in late July, have water retention in the Gaobao Lake estimated at about 1,000 flows per second, because the dam ridges have not been completely cleared. In order to empty the lake water as soon as possible, the dam ridges must be cleared to increase the discharge of the canal into the river. The East China Flood Control Headquarters has sent two dredgers to assist in excavation.
    While carrying out preparations, various localities have also launched comprehensive defense work. For example, the people along the Grand Canal in Gaoyou, Baoying, Jiangdu, and other counties in the Taizhou area have been fully mobilized to patrol the dikes day and night, inspect and repair the dangerous sections of the dikes in a timely manner. More than 10,000 people in Baoying County along the Grand Canal dike have participated in flood prevention organizations. (Northern Jiangsu Daily, Lin Yuguang, Chen Wulou)

　　准备战胜淮河下注洪水
    苏北里运河全线布防
    【本报讯】综合苏北日报及通讯员报导：淮河洪水下注后，确保洪泽湖大堤与里运河堤已成为目前华东防汛工作中的一个严重任务。如果该两堤确保，则高邮湖，宝应湖沿岸各地两千余万亩秋禾即可获丰收，还对皖北今年的救灾工作也有重大关系。现苏北里运河堤与洪泽湖大堤沿岸人民在当地防汛指挥部的领导下，已全面展开设防工作。
    苏北里运河正当淮河下游，淮河洪水流入洪泽湖后，除小部分经张福河向东入海外，其主要出路是经过三河、高邮湖、宝应湖，经里运河流入长江。目前淮河洪水已注入洪泽湖。本月七日里运河高邮御码头水位也已达八点一九公尺，距危险水位仅差零点二七公尺。为此，华东防汛总指挥部号召苏北沿河、湖人民，确保河堤与洪水作斗争。并于七月二十七日派出检查组赴苏北，协助该区进行加修工程，并增拨大米一千五百万斤作为工程费。苏北行署也于七月二十一日在宝应召开了紧急防汛会议，决定防汛为当前压倒一切的中心任务，以确保洪泽湖大堤及运河堤的安全，巩固新沂河堤防，并拨出紧急工程费用粮五百九十余万斤，以扶助运河堤、洪湖大堤、盐河及白马湖等堤岸的加修工程。同时，为了便利于洪水宣泄，又决定将扬州以下的拦江、壁虎、褚山三座旧江坝开放，事先腾空高宝湖水，减轻将来里运河之负担。
    防汛工作布置下去后，各地即立即展开了紧张的防汛工作。沿里运河堤已分南、中、北三段，分别设立防汛指挥部。洪湖大堤亦单独成立指挥部。在加修工程方面：洪湖大堤因隐患极多，已准备加修土工二十九万公方。在高宝湖一线的里运河西堤准备以十九万吨石头加做石堰，以备洪湖大堤万一不保时，使浪打不到东堤。同时并在东堤上再加工培厚，要求里运河堤工程能防御比一九三一年的水位高出一公尺的洪水。在器材准备方面：除派遣三十多个干部专到江南购买石料、木料、铅丝、麻袋等抢险必需器材外，并发动群众自筹器材，进行抽查、登记、集中等工作，以备急用。在交通联络方面：拟在运河南段险工处增设十部电话，沿堤并装设电灯，以备风雨黑夜抢险。中共苏北区党委、行政公署、军区司令部亦拟抽出四辆卡车和十匹马，作为必要时的交通联络工具。此外，在七月下旬开启的拦江、壁虎、褚山等三座旧江坝，由于坝埂未能彻底清除，据测量估计每秒钟停留在高宝湖的水约一千个流量。为了早日放空湖水，必须清除坝埂，以增加运河入江泄量。华东防汛总指挥部已派挖泥机两架前往协助掘挖。
    各地一边进行准备工作，同时展开全面设防工作。如泰州专区的高邮、宝应、江都等县运河沿岸人民已经全面动员昼夜上堤巡逻，检查并及时修整堤防险工。宝应县沿运河堤已有万余人参加防汛组织。（苏北日报、林宇光、陈午楼）
