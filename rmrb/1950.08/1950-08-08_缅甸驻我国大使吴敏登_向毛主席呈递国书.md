Ambassador Wu Min Deng delivered a eulogy to Chairman Mao Zedong when presenting his credentials, and Chairman Mao Zedong delivered a response.

The full text of the Burmese Ambassador's eulogy is as follows:
Your Excellency,
I am honored to present to you the Letter of Credence appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Union of Burma to the People's Republic of China.

For many centuries in history, China and Burma have been friendly neighbors and close collaborators in the fields of evergreen culture and scholarship. The ocean severed Burma's frequent contacts with the outside world for many years, but a thriving trade has existed between China and Burma along a land route since time immemorial. The transport teams traveling through the mountains and ravines that form the common border of our two countries not only exchanged valuable goods but also exchanged precious ideas and concepts.

I have come to this historic city with the warm and friendly respect of the Burmese people, their heartfelt wishes for the happiness and prosperity of the Chinese people, and their prayers for the eternal greatness of China. The Burmese people sincerely hope to maintain the close relationship between them and the Chinese people, and to cherish and maintain the closest friendship that has been shown by these two nations for many years. In these uneasy days when world peace is constantly threatened, closer cooperation and complete understanding among the Asian people are factors that must be created to maintain their hard-won and newly regained freedom.

The goal of the Burmese government is to establish closer cooperation with the People's Republic of China. I will make ardent efforts and do my part to achieve this goal.

My government has entrusted me with the task of representing Burma in this great country, and I feel supremely honored and fortunate; I hope I will be worthy of this honor.

I request that you allow me to convey the respect and wishes of the President of the Union of Burma to Your Excellency.

The full text of Chairman Mao's reply is as follows:
Mr. Ambassador,

It gives me great pleasure to accept the Letter of Credence presented by Your Excellency, the Ambassador of the Union of Burma; and I thank Your Excellency for your congratulations.

China and Burma are adjacent to each other, and not only have close relations in history and culture, but also have a profound friendship like brothers between the two peoples. In recent centuries, the people of both China and Burma have carried out long-term and courageous struggles for the independence and freedom of their own nations. Therefore, the sympathy and understanding existing between the people of your country and ours are also very deep. The new establishment

　　缅甸驻我国大使吴敏登
    向毛主席呈递国书
    【新华社七日讯】缅甸联邦驻我国首任特命全权大使吴敏登于七日下午六时偕一等秘书吴辟，三等秘书吴藻文及吴巴棠，向我国中央人民政府毛泽东主席呈递国书。在场的有中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠，中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来，中国人民解放军代总参谋长聂荣臻，外交部办公厅主任王炳南，中央人民政府典礼局局长余心清，外交部交际处处长王倬如。吴敏登大使呈递国书时曾向毛泽东主席致颂词，毛泽东主席致答词。
    缅甸大使颂词全文如下：阁下：
    我荣幸地将委任我为缅甸联邦驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书递交给您。
    历史上许多世纪以来，中国和缅甸一直是友好的邻邦，在长青的文化和学术的领域内又是密切的合作者。海洋曾将缅甸与外界的频繁的联系隔断了许多年代，但在中国与缅甸之间却从业已遗忘了的时候起早就沿着一条陆路存在着繁荣的贸易。往来于构成我们两国共同国境的山岳沟壑间的驮运队，不仅交换了贵重的货品，也同时交流了珍贵的思想与观念。
    我来到这座历史上的名城，带来了缅甸人民热烈与友好的敬意，他们对中国人民幸福、繁荣的衷心愿望，以及对中国永恒伟大的祝祷。缅甸人诚挚地希望维系他们与中国人之间的亲密关系。珍视及保持多少年代来便由这两个民族互相显示出来的最亲密的友情。在当前世界和平不断遭受威胁的不安定的日子里，亚洲人民间更加密切的合作及完满的了解是保持他们艰难获得及新近争回的自由所必须缔造起来的因素。
    缅甸政府的目标是在于与中华人民共和国建立起更为密切的合作。我将以热诚的努力并尽我的一分力量，来争取这一目标的实现。
    我的政府以在这个伟大国家中代表缅甸的任务交托给我，我感到无上的光荣和幸运；我希望我将无愧于这个光荣。
    我请求您允许我将缅甸联邦总统的敬意和祝愿面陈给阁下。
    毛主席答词全文如下：大使先生：
    我很高兴地接受贵大使呈递的缅甸联邦总统的国书；并感谢贵大使的祝贺。
    中缅两国，国境毗连，不但在历史、文化上有着密切的关系，而且在两国人民间更存在着兄弟般的深厚友谊。近世纪来，中缅两国人民都曾为自己民族的独立和自由，进行长期而勇敢的斗争。因此，存在于贵我两国人民间的同情与了解，也是很深切的。现在中缅两国新的外交关系的建立，无疑将使已存在于两国人民间的友谊更加发展，我并相信其将有助于亚洲及世界的持久和平。
    我热烈地欢迎阁下出任缅甸联邦驻中华人民共和国首任特命全权大使，并愿对贵大使加强两国合作的工作，予以协助。
    谨祝贵国国家繁荣，人民兴旺，并祝贵国元首健康。
