　　New Victory in Soviet Academic Research
　　Li He
　　Recently, two major events have occurred in Soviet academic circles: one is the debate on linguistics organized by the Pravda, and the other is the debate on physiology conducted at the meeting of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences. The former has concluded with the publication of Comrade Stalin's outstanding thesis; the latter also ended on July 4th, making important decisions on promoting Pavlov's theory. The conclusion of the debate not only moved the Soviet academic community a big step forward ideologically but is also a new victory of great influence in Soviet academic research.
　　Comrade Stalin has a famous saying that "without debates of differing opinions, without free criticism, no science can develop or progress." Conducting debates to resolve ideological problems, unfolding principled criticism and self-criticism in the debates, is a method frequently used by the advanced Soviet academic community to improve and enhance its work. The debates on linguistics and physiology this time are similarly debates of this kind.
　　Here I would like to introduce the situation of the linguistics debate this time.
　　The debate on linguistics problems this time was organized by the editorial department of Pravda and conducted in Pravda. In the words of the Pravda editorial department, the purpose of the debate was to "overcome the stagnation in the development of Soviet linguistics through criticism and self-criticism, and thereafter to give this area of scientific work a correct direction." The debate began on May 9th and ended on June 4th. During this month, Pravda published two additional pages each week, dedicated to publishing debate articles. Participation in the debate was very enthusiastic. The Pravda editorial department received more than two hundred papers in total, all written by scientific workers from Moscow, Leningrad, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Lithuania, Moldova, Latvia, Estonia, and other republics, as well as other provinces, cities, and districts, mainly linguists. Pravda also received many letters from readers who were concerned about this issue. During the debate, many important issues in the development of Soviet linguistics were brought up for discussion.
　　Near the end of the debate, Comrade Stalin published two important papers. One was "On Marxism in Linguistics," which was first published in the May 20th issue of Pravda; the other was "On Some Problems of Linguistics," which was first published in the magazine "Bolshevik" and then published in Pravda on June 4th.
　　In his first paper, Comrade Stalin discussed four issues in linguistics, namely: (1) language is not a superstructure on the economic base, and it is a serious mistake to confuse the two; (2) language is unified for society and common to the organized members of society, while the formula of the "class nature" of language is wrong and non-Marxist; (3) the characteristics of language; (4) the errors and shortcomings in Soviet linguistic research and linguistic research institutions. In his paper, Comrade Stalin thoroughly criticized the erroneous Marr theory in linguistics and pointed out in the conclusion: "Eliminating the military rule in linguistics, abandoning Marr's errors, and instilling Marxism into linguistics, this will be the path for the sound development of Soviet linguistics."
　　In another paper, Comrade Stalin answered five questions raised by Krasheninnikova. Comrade Stalin pointed out here that Marr's works are not entirely composed of errors, and he still has some good works. Linguists should acquire these and use them.
　　At the end of the debate, Pravda published an editorial, believing that Comrade Stalin "provided a classic demonstration of creatively applying dialectics to linguistics," and that Comrade Stalin's paper "is a genius contribution to science and brought about a true revolution in linguistics, is an outstanding new contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory, and these works armed the workers of all departments of social science with new theoretical principles."
　　Before the debate, some scholars in the Soviet linguistic community, who were in leading positions, blindly praised Marr's theory and suppressed criticism of Marr's theory. Marr was a deceased Soviet linguist. His pseudo-Marxist linguistic "new theory" once confused some people. This theory can be summarized in the following points: (1) language is a superstructure like ideology; (2) the pyramid development view and the four-element theory. Believing that the development of language is pyramid-shaped from bottom to top, initially diverse, and later unified through mixing. Believing that the commonality between languages of the same language family (language system) is not the result of the development of the same language branch at the beginning, but the result of the mixing of many initially different languages; believing that every mixed language contains traces of all languages in the world, so every language more or less contains the elements of the four sounds SAL, BER, YON, ROSH. Using this four-element analysis method, which disregards all specific historical conditions, to oppose the comparative historical method (studying the history of language development by comparing the common origins of languages of the same language family), which is still useful, insisting that comparing the origins of languages is to restore ancient grammar. (3) The theory of leapfrog development. Believing that new and more advanced languages are produced by qualitative changes through leaps from quantitative changes; believing that every language is a stage of development from low to high, and all conform to the quality of its economic base; believing that class division is the main content of linguistics; believing that the simple grammar of Chinese conforms to primitive communist society, and the complex grammar of Indo-European languages conforms to class society, regardless of the national form of the language and the specific history of the people who use the language. (4) The theory of class nature. Believing that language is of the class, not of the whole people.
　　Marr vulgarly applied the formulas of historical materialism, did not understand the particularity and development laws of language, and as a result, made a series of anti-historical and idealistic mistakes. Marr's "disciples" repeated Marr's mistakes uncritically, which further caused stagnation in the development of Soviet linguistics. These errors have been completely cleared after the publication of Comrade Stalin's paper, as the Pravda editorial said: "Comrade Stalin completely eliminated simplistic vulgarization and idealism in linguistics."
　　On June 4th, Pravda published many papers and letters from linguists, many of which were self-criticisms from scholars who had been influenced by Marr's views. All the papers and letters unanimously expressed their determination to follow the path indicated by Comrade Stalin to develop linguistic research. Among them, Vinogradov's words are the most representative, he said: "Comrade Stalin's paper gave Soviet linguists the key to solving the basic problems of linguistics in a truly Marxist way."
　　From the debate on linguistic problems in the Soviet Union and the solution of the problems, we have once again learned how the Soviet academic community handles ideological struggles, and we have once again seen how the Soviet Communist Party and Comrade Stalin are concerned about the development of science.

### 苏联学术研究的新胜利

　　苏联学术研究的新胜利
    李何
    最近苏联学术界发生了两件大事：一件是真理报组织的关于语言学的辩论，一件是苏联科学院和苏联医药科学院的会议所进行的关于生理学的辩论。前者已在斯大林同志发表的卓越的论文中得出了结论；后者亦已于七月四日结束，作出了有关发扬巴甫洛夫学说的重要决定。辩论的终结，不仅使苏联学术界在思想上更向前迈进了一大步，并且是苏联学术研究的具有重大影响的新胜利。
    斯大林同志有一句名言说：“如果没有不同意见的争论，没有自由批评，任何科学都是不可能发展，不可能进步的”。进行解决思想问题的辩论，在辩论中展开原则性的批评和自我批评，这是先进的苏联学术界经常用来改进和提高工作的方法。这次语言学和生理学的辩论，同样是属于这一类的辩论。
    这里想介绍一下这次语言学辩论的情形。
    这次语言学问题的辩论，是由真理报编辑部组织，在真理报上进行的。用真理报编辑部的话来说，辩论的目的是要“以批评和自我批评的方法，克服苏维埃语言学发展中的停滞现象，并在此后给这方面的科学工作以正确的方向”。辩论开始于五月九日，于六月四日结束。在这一个月内，真理报每周增刊两版，专门刊载辩论文章。参加辩论的非常踊跃。真理报编辑部收到的论文一共在二百篇以上，都是莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、乔治亚、哈萨克、亚美尼亚、立陶宛、摩尔达维亚、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚等共和国，及其他的省、城市、和区里的科学工作者写来的，其中主要是语言学者。真理报还收到了许许多多关心这一问题的读者的来信。在辩论进行中，苏维埃语言学发展中的许多重大问题都拿出来讨论过了。
    在辩论将结束时，斯大林同志发表了两篇重要论文。一篇是《论马克思主义在语言学中的问题》，首先登在五月二十日的真理报上；另一篇是《论语言学的一些问题》，首先登在《布尔什维克》杂志上，六月四日又在真理报上刊登。
    斯大林同志在第一篇论文中，论述了语言学中的四个问题，即：（一）语言不是经济基础上的上层建筑，把两者混为一谈，是犯了严重的错误；（二）语言对于社会是统一的，对社会的组织成员是共同的，而语言的“阶级性”的公式，是错误的、非马克思主义的公式；（三）语言的特征；（四）苏联关于语言学研究和语言学研究机关中的错误与缺点。斯大林同志在论文中彻底批判了语言学中的错误的马尔学说，并在结语中指出：“取消语言学中的军阀式的统治，抛弃马尔的错误，把马克思主义灌输到语言学中去，这才会是苏联语言学健全发展的道路。”
    在另一篇论文中，斯大林同志答复了克拉舍宁尼科娃提出的五个问题。斯大林同志在这里指出：马尔的著作并不完全是由错误组成的，他仍然有个别的好的作品。语言学家应当取得这些并使用它。
    辩论结束时，真理报发表社论，认为斯大林同志“提供了创造性地运用辩证法到语言学中去的经典式的示范”，斯大林同志的论文，“是对科学的天才贡献，并且带来了语言学上的真实的革命，是对马列主义理论的卓越的新贡献，这些作品以新的理论原则武装了社会科学一切部门的工作者”。
    在辩论之前，苏联语言学界有一些居于领导地位的学者，盲目地推崇马尔学说，并且压制对马尔学说的批评。马尔是一个业已去世的苏联语言学家。他的伪马克思主义的语言学《新学说》，曾经迷惑了一些人。这个学说概括起来有这样几点：（一）语言是意识形态之类的上层建筑物；（二）金字塔发展观和四因素论。认为语言的发展是金字塔式从底到顶，起初是多样的，后来经过混合而归一。认为同语族（语言系统）的语言之间的共同性，不是由起初同一的语言分支发展的结果，而是许多起初不同的语言混合的结果；认为每一种混合后的语言都含有世界一切语言的痕迹，所以每一种语言或多或少都含有ＳＡＬ，ＢＥＲ，ＹＯＮ，ＲＯＳＨ这四个声音的因素。用这种不顾一切具体历史条件的四因素分析法，来反对多少还有用处的比较历史的方法（以比较同语族各语言的共同来源的方法来研究语言发展史，其缺点在于无法比较非同语族的语言），硬说比较语言的来源就是要恢复古语经。（三）跳跃发展论。认为新的更高级的语言是由量变到质变，经过跳跃而产生的；认为每一种语言都是从低级到高级发展的一个阶段，都是符合于其经济基础的质量；认为划阶级是语言学的主要内容；认为文法简朴的汉语符合于原始共产主义社会，文法复杂的印度欧罗巴语言符合于阶级社会，而不问语言的民族形式以及使用语言的人民的具体历史。（四）阶级性论。认为语言是阶级的，不是全民的。
    马尔庸俗地搬用唯物史观公式，不懂得语言的特殊性和发展规律，结果铸成一连串反历史的、唯心主义的大错。马尔的“门徒”们无批判地重复马尔的错误，更造成了苏联语言学发展的停滞现象。这些错误在斯大林同志的论文发表之后，已经完全被清除了，正如真理报的社论所说：“斯大林同志把语言学中简单化庸俗化行为和唯心主义，清除得干干净净。”
    六月四日，真理报发表了许多语言学者的论文和信件，其中不少是受过马尔观点的影响的学者的自我批评。所有的论文和信件，一致表示决心遵循斯大林同志所指示的道路来发展语言学的研究。其中，维诺格拉多夫的话最具代表性，他说：“斯大林同志的论文，给了苏维埃语言学者以真正马克思主义地解决语言学基本问题的钥匙。”
    我们从苏联语言学问题的辩论及问题的解决上，又一次学习了苏联学术界如何处理思想斗争问题，又一次看到了苏联共产党和斯大林同志对于科学的发展是怎样地关怀。        （新华社讯）
