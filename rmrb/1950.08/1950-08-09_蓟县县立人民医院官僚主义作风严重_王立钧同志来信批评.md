Comrade Editor:

    Jixian County People's Hospital in Hebei Province was established in July 1949. Due to the serious bureaucratic work style of the leadership and the lack of a "serve the people" perspective, there are serious shortcomings in medical work.

    First, the hospital lacks planning in its work, its work efficiency is not high, and it mechanically emphasizes procedures and working hours, without administering treatment based on specific circumstances. For example, when patients come to the hospital for treatment, if it is not during working hours or the procedures are not followed, they are refused treatment regardless of the severity or urgency of their illness. For example, Su Jian's wife from Dongdajing Village in the first district, suffered from vegetable poisoning on the evening of June 3rd. Her whole body was red and swollen, and her life was in danger. Su Jian took a letter of introduction from the district government and ran to the hospital to ask for a doctor. Because it was getting dark, the hospital refused to send a doctor.

    Lu Yongxiang, the 16-year-old son of Lu Guang, an organization cadre of the First District Committee, was accidentally injured in the left cheek by a bullet on the afternoon of July 14th. Lu Yongxiang took Lu Guang to the hospital for treatment. Because it was not office hours, they waited for two hours without anyone providing treatment. Lu Guang cried out in pain, and the wound became increasingly swollen. As it was getting dark, Lu Yongxiang was very anxious and couldn't find a doctor, so he had to take the child away from the hospital. On July 21st, five disaster victims in the county developed acute illnesses. Comrade Xie Chengwu, secretary of the County Committee, wrote a letter and sent someone to the hospital to ask for a doctor to treat them. President Zhang Boshi promised to go soon. However, Secretary Xie waited for more than an hour, but the doctor had not yet arrived. He went to the hospital himself to urge them. It turned out that the doctor was taking a nap. President Zhang had also forgotten about the matter. The above are just a few examples; similar things happen often.

    Secondly, the hospital's doctors are also very irresponsible in their medical work. They are careless when making diagnoses, often exaggerating the condition, causing patients to feel threatened mentally; they even carelessly prescribe the wrong medicine for patients, treating patients' lives as a joke; sometimes they use the excuse of not having medicines and equipment to avoid providing proper treatment to patients. For example, Liu Junrui, a middle school student, had worms in his stomach and was in great pain. The hospital doctor said that his illness could not be treated (and later said: there is no diagnostic instrument, and he dare not determine the condition, thus refusing treatment). However, Liu Junrui went to another hospital for treatment and was cured. At the beginning of June, Dong Shanlin's gun went off accidentally, putting a hole through his palm. He went to the hospital for two months, but not only was it not cured, but it was made worse. The doctor said it was for disinfection and told Dong Shanlin to take sulfonamides. After taking two doses, he immediately felt palpitations, dizziness, and stomach pain, and asked the doctor if he had taken the wrong medicine. The doctor said casually, "That's right, eat more so you get better faster." Dong Shanlin took four doses of sulfonamides, and his stomach pain became even worse. The bullet hole in his palm also rotted, and countless black bumps appeared all over his body. He became delirious. Dong Shanmu felt unwell and complained to President Zhang. Only then did he realize that Dong had been poisoned by too much sulfonamides. He gave him a disinfectant injection to stop the spread of the disease.

    The hospital food for patients, although allocated four catties of millet per person per day, is still very poor. For a long time, patients were unwilling to eat the food from the kitchen. Some went outside to buy food, and some had meals delivered from restaurants.

    The occurrence of this series of events is inseparable from President Zhang Boshi's bureaucratic work style. He does not review his mistakes, but only emphasizes objective reasons and does not humbly accept the opinions of others. In his use of personnel, he does not proceed from work needs, but arbitrarily appoints private individuals. Last December, he said that in order to save expenses and streamline personnel, he sent nurses Tian Baolin and Su Fa home, and introduced Huo An and Wu Jinshun to work at the Prefectural Commissioner's Office. But in February of this year, he called his nephew Zhang Naiying to the hospital to work as a nurse. Zhang Naiying was originally a staff member of the county government, whose work has been consistently unreliable, repeatedly absenting himself without leave, and engaging in affairs with women. The county government had already dismissed him, and the County Committee had also decided to cancel his probationary party member status. President Zhang actually retained him for use without the approval of his superiors. This clearly shows his serious lack of organization and discipline. Another example is Hu Jingyao, whose ability is very poor, but was also introduced to work in the prevention and treatment group due to his personal relationship. The cadres in the hospital have a lot of opinions on this and said in discussions, "Those with strong working ability are transferred away, but those who don't know the technology are used instead. It's true that it's good to have someone in court."

    I suggest that in this rectification movement, the leadership should help President Zhang to seriously examine his work and correct his past erroneous thinking and shortcomings in his work.

### 蓟县县立人民医院官僚主义作风严重  王立钧同志来信批评

　　蓟县县立人民医院官僚主义作风严重
    王立钧同志来信批评编者同志：
    河北省蓟县县立人民医院，是在一九四九年七月建立的。由于领导上有着严重的官僚主义作风和缺乏为人民服务的观点，所以在医护工作中存在着严重的缺点。
    首先该院在工作上缺乏计划，工作效率不高，并且机械地强调手续和作息时间，而不根据具体情况施诊。如病人到院求诊时，不在工作时间或是手续不合，则不论病势轻重缓急，一律拒绝医治。例如一区东大井村苏俭的媳妇，在六月三日傍晚吃野菜中毒，全身红肿，性命危险。苏俭拿着区政府的介绍信跑到医院请医生。因为天快黑了，院方就拒绝出诊。
    该县一区区委组织干事路永祥的十六岁的儿子路广，在七月十四日午后因不慎被子弹把左腮炸坏了。路永祥就领着路广到医院去治疗。因为当时不是办公时间，一直等了两个钟头也没人给治。路广疼的直叫喊，伤口愈来愈肿。当时天又快黑了，路永祥很着急，找医生也找不到，只得领着孩子离开医院。七月二十一日，该县有五个灾民得了急症。县委会秘书谢承武同志写信派人到医院请医生诊治。院长张伯实答应随后就去。但是谢秘书等了一点多钟，医生还没来。他就亲自跑到医院去催。原来医生正在睡午觉。张院长也早把这件事情忘掉了。以上所举只是几个例子，类似的事情还很多。
    其次，该院医生在医疗工作上也很不负责任。诊断时马虎从事，时常夸大病情，使病人在精神上感到威胁；甚至粗枝大叶地给病人乱吃药，拿病人生命当儿戏；有时借口没有药品器具，不给病人好好诊治。如中学生刘俊瑞，肚里生了虫，疼的很厉害。该院医生却说他的病没法治疗（后来又说：没有诊断器，不敢断定病情，因而拒绝医治）。但是后来刘俊瑞到别家医院去医治，就治好了。六月初董山林的枪走火，把手掌打了一个透眼。到医院治了两个月，不但没有治好，反而治坏了。医生说是为了消毒，叫董山林吃?胺。他吃了两剂以后，立刻感觉心慌、头晕、胃痛，就问医生是不是吃错了药。医生马马虎虎地说：“不错，多吃点好的快。”董山林吃了四剂?胺，胃痛更厉害了，手掌上的枪眼也腐烂了，全身起了无数黑疙瘩，神志恍忽。董山木感觉不好，又向张院长提意见。他这才发觉董多吃?胺中了毒。就替他打消毒药针，停止了病势的扩大。
    该院病员的伙食，每天每人虽摊了四斤小米，但是仍吃得很不好。曾有一个很长时期，病员们不愿吃伙房里的饭，有的跑到外面买饭吃，有的到饭铺包饭。
    以上这一连串事情的发生，和院长张伯实的官僚主义作风是分不开的。他对自己的错误不进行检讨，只是强调客观原因，不虚心接受别人的意见。他在用人上，不从工作需要出发，任意任用私人。去年十二月，他说是为了节省开支、精简人员，就把护士田宝林、苏发两同志打发回家，把霍安、吴进顺介绍到专署工作。但在今年二月他却把他侄子张乃英叫到医院当护士。而张乃英本是县政府的工作人员，工作一贯不踏实，屡次开小差，搞女人，已被县政府撤消工作，县委也决定取消其候补党员资格。张院长竟未经上级批准，私自留用。这明显地表现了他的严重的无组织无纪律作风。再如胡景药，能力很差，也因他的私人关系介绍到防治组工作。院里干部对此很有意见，议论纷纷地说：“工作能力强的调走了，反而用不会技术的，真是朝里有人好作官。”
    我建议：在这次整风运动中，领导上应帮助张院长认真检查工作，纠正过去的错误思想和工作中的缺点。
