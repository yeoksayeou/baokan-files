Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 31st: Under the leadership of the People's Government, cotton farmers in Northeast China have vigorously prevented and controlled plant diseases and insect pests this year, ensuring the normal growth of three million mu of cotton seedlings. If there are no unexpected disasters in the future, a bumper cotton harvest is expected.

In Liaoxi Province, a major cotton-producing area in Northeast China, 440,000 mu of cotton fields were infested with pests this year. The Provincial People's Government issued an urgent instruction to transplant seedlings, and a widespread seedling transplantation campaign was immediately launched throughout the province. Statistics show that more than 580,000 seedlings were transplanted across the province, with an average survival rate of 70%, which can reduce cotton field losses by 10%. In this work, cadres at the county and district levels went deep into the countryside to carry out propaganda and education, and personally demonstrated with examples to break the conservative thinking of some farmers who believed that "cotton seedlings cannot survive transplantation." After the seedling transplantation work was completed, the province organized forces to catch insects. As of the beginning of this month, insect pests in cotton fields throughout the province have been basically eliminated, and the growth of cotton seedlings has returned to normal. It is estimated that 70% of the harvest can be ensured.

In Liaodong Province, after cotton fields completed sowing in mid-May, continuous rainy and cold weather caused widespread damping-off disease after the emergence of cotton seedlings. The Provincial People's Government immediately called on and organized farmers to remove diseased seedlings and replant them. By mid-June, the province had completely replanted all cotton seedlings. In late June, many areas of the province experienced cotton aphid infestations, which were also promptly led by the People's Government to capture and kill, and the insect disaster gradually subsided. Farmers in various places are still continuing to spray pesticides to strive for the recovery of all affected cotton seedlings.

According to the latest statistics, the total cotton planting area in Northeast China this year has reached more than 3.02 million mu, exceeding the original plan by 32%. After the above-mentioned measures to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, the original sown area of cotton fields has been largely maintained in various places. At present, the growth of cotton seedlings is good, the seedlings are more than one foot tall, and they are blooming.

Shenyang News: Northeast Daily reports: Special local crops in Northeast China, such as cotton, flax, ramie, and sugar beets, are growing well and are expected to have a bumper harvest. Flax, which is abundant in 13 counties in northern Manchuria, such as Keshan, Bayan, and Wangqing, is now mature. Boli and Yongji counties started harvesting in mid-July, with an average yield of about 2,000 jin per hectare, an increase of more than 400 jin compared to the unit yield of 1,600 jin per hectare last year. This year, a total of 25,000 hectares were planted, and it is estimated that more than 4.9 million jin can be harvested. Kenaf and ramie, one of the only raw materials for making sacks, are currently looking like a tenth-year crop. Among them, kenaf is three or four feet tall and flowering is widespread. The total planting area is more than 12,000 hectares, and it is estimated that 10 million jin of fiber can be produced; ramie branches and stems have reached the backs of cattle. According to the growth situation, it is estimated that each hectare can exceed the required output (1,250 jin), and about 27 million jin of fiber can be produced. The total output of these two kinds of hemp can provide the minimum required raw materials for the Liaoyang and Shenyang sack factories next year. Sugar beets, which are abundant in Songjiang and Jilin provinces, currently have stems that are more than two feet tall and more than 20 leaves. According to observations by various sugar factories, the weight of beet roots is already more than one jin, and the sugar content is more than 8%. It has been determined as a tenth-year crop. It is estimated that the minimum output per hectare is 12 tons, an increase of more than 2 tons per hectare compared to last year. Cotton, the main raw material for the textile industry, suffered from "damping-off disease" and insect pests as soon as the seedlings emerged this year. However, thanks to the government's strengthened leadership in prevention and control, seedling transplantation, and replanting, the cotton seedlings gradually recovered after the "Summer Solstice", basically maintaining 80% of the seedlings. They are now blooming with seven or eight branches and forming two or three peaches. If there are no other natural disasters in the future, 80% of the harvest can be ensured.

The preliminary results of this year's special products are mainly due to the implementation of the policy of rewarding the planting of special products by governments at all levels. In addition to providing seed loans and financial assistance after the spring, relevant departments, agencies, and factories have also signed pre-purchase contracts with farmers to ensure the prices of special products, eliminate farmers' ideological concerns, and improve their enthusiasm for planting special products. For example, after the Harbin and Acheng sugar factories in Songjiang Province signed pre-purchase contracts with farmers, the farmers strengthened intensive cultivation and fine farming, and the amount of fertilizer applied increased by more than 35% compared to last year, and three shovelings and two hoeings were generally achieved.

Due to the expansion of the area of special products this year, the procurement task will also be heavy. In order to successfully complete this task, the Northeast China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, the Native Produce Company, the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau, and other relevant factories have begun to prepare for the procurement of special products. The Northeast Textile Administration Bureau specifically convened a factory director meeting on July 10 to discuss flax raw materials, focusing on how to carry out procurement. In arranging this work, relevant departments have paid special attention to studying the issue of inspection and pricing to ensure fair and reasonable prices so that neither farmers nor the state suffer losses. The Northeast People's Government has also instructed all flax-producing counties to quickly establish flax procurement committees and absorb people's representatives to participate in the assessment of grades.

　　东北区特产作物  棉麻甜菜可望丰收  有关部门积极准备收购
    【新华社沈阳三十一日电】东北植棉农民今年在人民政府领导下大力防除病虫害，保住了三百万亩棉苗的正常发育，今后如无意外灾害，棉花可望丰收。
    东北主要产棉区辽西省，今年曾有四十四万亩棉田发生虫害。该省人民政府曾发出紧急移苗指示，各地随即广泛开展了移苗运动。统计全省共移苗五十八万多棵，成活率平均达到百分之七十，因而可使棉田减少一成损失。在这个工作中，各县区干部均深入农村，进行宣传教育，并亲自动手示范，以实例打破一部分农民所认为“棉苗栽不活”的保守思想。在移苗工作结束以后，该省各地即组织力量捕虫。迄本月上旬止，全省棉田害虫亦已基本扑灭，棉苗生长均已恢复常态，估计可保住七成年景。
    辽东省棉田在五月中旬完成播种后，因连日阴雨，天气转寒，致棉苗出土后普遍发生立枯病。该省人民政府立即号召和组织农民拔除病苗，进行补种，至六月中旬止，全省已将棉苗全部补足。六月下旬，该省许多地区发生棉蚜，亦由人民政府及时领导农民捕打，虫灾逐渐减轻。现各地农民仍在继续喷射药水，争取全部受害棉苗复苏。
    东北全区今年植棉面积，据最近统计已达三百零二万余亩，超过原来计划百分之三十二。上述各地经过防除病虫害的种种措施后，均大体保住了原来棉田的播种面积。现棉苗生长情况良好，苗高逾尺，正在开花。
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北区棉花、亚麻、青麻、甜菜等特产作物，均生育良好，可望丰收。盛产于北满克山、巴彦、汪清等十三县内之亚麻，目前已成熟，勃利及永吉二县于七月中旬即动手开割，每垧平均可产二千斤左右，较去年每垧单位产量（一千六百斤）增加四百余斤，今年共播种两万五千垧总计可收四百九十余万市斤。麻袋唯一原料之一的洋麻与青麻，目前均看十成年景，其中洋麻干高三、四尺，普遍开花，总计播种面积为一万二千多垧，估计可产纤维一千万斤；青麻枝干已漫牛背，按生育情况每垧估计可超过要求产量（一千二百五十斤），约可产纤维二千七百多万斤。此二种麻总产量明年可供辽阳及沈阳两麻袋工厂最低需要之原料。盛产于松江、吉林二省之甜菜，目前茎高已二尺多，叶二十多个。据各糖厂观察：菜根重已一斤多，含糖量百分之八多，已确定为十成年景，估计每垧最低可产十二吨，较去年每垧增产两吨多。主要纺织工业原料之棉花，今年小苗一出土即遭受了“立枯病”及虫害，但由于政府加强领导防治、移苗、补种，“夏至”后棉苗逐渐复苏，基本保住了八成苗，现已开花七、八枝，结桃两三个，以后如无其他自然灾害，可保住八成年景。
    今年特产获得以上初步成果，主要是各级人民政府贯彻了奖励种植特产政策，开春后除贷种、贷款扶助外，各有关部门机关工厂，并与农民订立了预购合同，以保证特产价格，打消了农民思想顾虑，提高了种植特产的积极性。如松江省哈尔滨、阿城两制糖厂与农民订了预购合同后，农民便加强了精耕细作，上粪一项即较去年增加了百分之三十五多，并普遍做到了三铲两趟。
    由于今年特产面积扩大，收购任务亦将繁重。为了胜利完成此项工作，东北区花纱布公司、土产公司、东北纺织管理局，以及其他有关工厂，已开始分别做收购特产准备工作。东北纺织管理局，特于七月十日召开了讨论亚麻原料的厂长会议，着重讨论了如何进行收购。在布置此项工作中，各有关部门均特别注意研究了验等议价问题，以保证价格公平合理，使农民与国家双方均不受损失。东北人民政府亦指示各产亚麻县份，迅速成立亚麻收购委员会，吸收人民代表参加评等级。
