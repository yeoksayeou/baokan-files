Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The first National Congress of Cooperative Workers of China has victoriously concluded on July 27th. The conference was held for twenty-two days under the guidance of Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Central People's Government and Vice Director Bo Yibo of the Central Financial and Economic Committee.

During the conference, Vice Chairmen Liu Shaoqi and Zhu De of the Central People's Government attended and gave speeches. Vice Director Bo Yibo gave a report on the current overall financial and economic situation. On the last day of the conference, based on the instructions of Vice Chairman Liu and the various problems discovered during the discussions, he gave a systematic summary report on the tasks, principles, and guidelines of the cooperatives in the future, the reorganization and transformation of cooperatives in the old liberated areas, the development steps of cooperatives in the new liberated areas, and specific issues such as the establishment of various systems and cadre rectification.

The delegates engaged in heated discussions during the conference, criticizing many past confused ideas and erroneous practices, thereby gaining a relatively clear and unified understanding of the nature, tasks, principles, guidelines, and specific practices of the cooperatives. All the delegates passed the resolution on submitting the draft "Cooperative Law of the People's Republic of China" to the Central People's Government for review and approval and promulgation, as well as the resolutions on the "Charter of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives"—"Draft Guidelines for the Charters of Grassroots Cooperatives and Federations at All Levels." They also elected Bo Yibo and 30 others as directors of the Provisional Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and Ye Jizhuang and 9 others as supervisors of the Provisional Supervisory Council.

In addition, the conference passed three temporary motions: that Chinese cooperatives should join the International Cooperative Alliance, calling on cooperative members nationwide to oppose American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and writing a letter in the name of all the delegates to the conference to pay respects to Chairman Mao.
