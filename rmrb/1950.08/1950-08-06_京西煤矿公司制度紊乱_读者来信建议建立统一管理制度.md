　　Jingxi Coal Mine Company System Disorganized
　　Reader's Letter Suggests Establishing a Unified Management System

To the Editor:

　　I am an employee of the Heishan Mine, which belongs to the Jingxi Coal Mine Company. Based on what I have seen and heard in over a year of work, I have the following feelings and opinions about the work of the Jingxi Coal Mine Company:

　　The Jingxi Coal Mine Company has been established for over a year. In this not-so-short period, the company has only focused on setting production targets and engineering plans, which is certainly good. However, there is no unified management system, which has led to chaos in management.

　　The five larger mines, such as Mentougou Coal Mine, Chengzi Coal Mine, Fangshan East Mine, Heishan Coal Mine, and Datai Coal Mine, each have their own work systems, welfare systems, wage systems, and reward and punishment systems. The company itself also has its own set of systems. For example, some mines rest on Sundays, while others do not. In terms of organizational structure, some mines use sections as units, some use teams, and some use a combination of both. The positions of cadres who have been working for a long time are also not clearly defined. For example, I have been working at the Heishan Coal Mine for over a year, but I still do not know what my position is. Every day, I just accept specific tasks assigned by my superiors. This has led to the phenomenon of work being shirked and no one daring to take responsibility. In terms of welfare, some mines provide housing for employees, and the mine is responsible for repairing any damage to the houses. Those who rent housing outside receive a certain amount of rent subsidy each month, but some mines do not provide anything at all. Therefore, some difficulties arise when employees are transferred. The wage system also largely follows the old system, which also urgently needs to be improved.

　　I hope that the Jingxi Coal Mine Company will quickly solicit opinions from the masses and establish a unified and rational management system and implement it promptly.

　　Heishan Coal Mine Engineering Section Gao Shengchang

　　Editor's Note: The situation reflected by Comrade Gao Shengchang deserves the attention of the leaders of the Jingxi Coal Mine. State-owned and public factories and enterprises must establish unified systems in all aspects to achieve enterprise-based management and improve work efficiency. In particular, there must be unified regulations regarding employees' wages, vacations, and other systems, reforming the old system and achieving democratic management, in order to further reassure workers in production and increase their labor enthusiasm. It is hoped that the leaders of the mine will widely absorb the constructive opinions of the workers and masses, thoroughly correct the existing shortcomings, and improve the work of the entire mine.

### 京西煤矿公司制度紊乱  读者来信建议建立统一管理制度

　　京西煤矿公司制度紊乱
    读者来信建议建立统一管理制度编辑同志：
    我是京西煤矿公司所属黑山矿厂的一个职员。在一年多的工作时间里，据我所见所闻，对京西煤矿公司的工作有以下感觉与意见：
    京西煤矿公司成立已一年多了。在这不短的时间中，公司只把注意力放在订生产任务和工程计划上，这当然是好的。但没有一个统一的管理制度，因而形成管理上的紊乱现象。
    像门头沟煤矿、城子煤矿、房山东矿、黑山煤矿、大台煤矿等五个较大的矿，各有各的工作制度、福利制度、工资制度、奖惩制度。公司本身又有一套制度。如有的矿星期日休息，有的矿星期日不休息。在组织系统上，有的矿以股为单位，有的以组为单位，有的则股组相间并用。对工作已经很久的工作干部的职位也不明确规定。如我自己在黑山煤矿工作已一年多了，但我还不知道我的职位是什么。每日只是接受上级分配的具体工作去做。因而产生了工作互相推诿，不敢负责的现象。在福利制度上，有的矿供给职工住房，房子坏了由矿方负责修理，在外面租房住的则每月津贴一定数量的房租，但有的矿则什么也不管，因此在职工调动工作时便发生了一些困难。在工资制度上，亦多沿用旧的制度。这也是亟待改进的。
    我希望京西煤矿公司赶快征求群众意见，建立起统一和合理的管理制度，并迅速付诸实行。
                黑山煤矿工务股  高盛昌
    编者按：高盛昌同志所反映的情况，是值得京西煤矿领导上注意的。国营公营工厂企业要做到经营企业化，提高工作效率，必须制定各方面的统一制度。特别是对职工的工资、休假等制度，必须有统一的规定，改革旧的制度，实现管理民主化，才能进一步使工人安心生产，提高其劳动热情。希望该矿领导上广泛吸取工人群众的建设性的意见，彻底纠正目前存在的缺点，改进全矿的工作。
