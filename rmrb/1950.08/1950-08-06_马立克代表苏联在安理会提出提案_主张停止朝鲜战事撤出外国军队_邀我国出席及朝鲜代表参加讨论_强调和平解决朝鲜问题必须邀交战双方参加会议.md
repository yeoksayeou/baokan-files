Xinhua News Agency, New York, 5th: TASS reports from New York on the 5th: The Security Council held a meeting on the 4th under the chairmanship of Malik to discuss the agenda adopted at the adjourned meeting on the 3rd. The agenda contained only one item proposed by the United States – "Accusation of Aggression Against the Republic of Korea."

　　After reading the agenda, Malik declared: Before discussing substantive issues, he would like to submit a proposal on behalf of the Soviet Union, entitled "Case on the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question." The case stated: "The Security Council resolves: (1) deems it necessary to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China and to hear the opinions of representatives of the Korean people when discussing the Korean question; (2) to cease hostilities in Korea and simultaneously withdraw foreign troops from Korea."

　　The Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu stated: Before further discussion, the representative of the so-called "Republic of Korea" should be invited to attend the Security Council meeting.

　　Egyptian representative Fawzi stated: There is an "effective resolution" of the Security Council from June 25th, which decided to invite "representatives of the Republic of Korea" to attend. Fawzi stated: The Security Council should continue to abide by this precedent.

　　Malik, in his capacity as the Soviet representative, stated: The Soviet delegation believes that the situation in Korea is a civil war. Therefore, the Soviet proposal includes the point that the Security Council should invite representatives of the Korean people to participate. He said: In order to stop such war actions in Korea, both parties must be invited. This is the established practice and tradition of the Security Council when discussing issues such as Palestine and Indonesia. Regardless of whether both parties are members of the Security Council, both are invited. In fact, the Security Council invited the Arab Higher Committee, an intergovernmental organization, to participate in the discussion of the Palestinian question.

　　Malik further said: Because the Security Council is going to discuss the US proposal, which accuses the so-called "North Korean authorities" of aggression, it would be unjust and impermissible to refuse to hear both sides. Malik said: It is necessary to hear representatives from both government camps. Therefore, the Soviet Union suggests inviting representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – a country that maintains diplomatic relations with several countries – to participate. The Security Council must not, on the one hand, allow the existence of situations where cities are bombed and people are massacred in the process of opposing the so-called "North Korean authorities," and on the other hand, refuse to hear the "North Korean authorities" speak.

　　Malik then pointed out: If there is no objection, the Chairman of the Security Council usually invites both parties to the dispute to participate, otherwise, the issue is put to discussion. He also said: The Soviet delegation believes that this is a substantive issue, not a procedural issue, because the issue is one of war or peace.

　　Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu claimed: Before the Security Council takes a decision on the Soviet representative's proposal, the South Korean representative should be invited to comply with the previous decision.

　　US representative Austin then delivered a speech, accusing Security Council Chairman Malik, insisting that he had adopted an unconventional procedure. Referring to the text of the Soviet proposal, Austin said that the proposal "exceeds the scope of the agenda." Austin said that the US delegation requested the chairman to invite the Republic of Korea to attend, because this issue had already been decided at the last Security Council meeting. Austin went on to say that the United Nations had declared the Rhee Syngman government to be the sole government representing Korea. Austin concluded that the US government believes that North Korean representatives should not be invited to participate in the discussion.

　　In responding to Austin's words, Malik reminded him that the Soviet suggestion was made by the Soviet delegation, and if Austin opposed it, his opposition should be addressed to the Soviet delegation, not to the Chairman of the Security Council. Malik also said, "I repeat, the Soviet delegation proposed inviting representatives from both belligerent parties to participate in the Security Council meeting." As for Austin's other remarks, Malik said that he reserved the right to respond later.

　　Next, British representative Jebb proposed that the two issues included in the Soviet suggestion should be separated and then voted on separately. He said that the Security Council should first vote on the suggestion to invite South Korean representatives to participate in the Security Council meeting, and then decide whether North Korean representatives should be invited. According to Jebb, precisely because the Security Council had previously invited South Korean representatives to participate in the Security Council meeting, the precedent of such a thing allowed him to continue to participate in all subsequent meetings on the same issue. However, Jebb admitted that the Security Council was not automatically obligated to allow South Korean representatives to participate based on this precedent. He said that because of this reason, the Security Council must first vote on this issue.

　　Jebb further stated that the issue of inviting North Korean representatives to participate was completely different, because the representatives of North Korea were already in opposition to the United Nations. In this way, Jebb was in fact demanding that if North Korean representatives were to obtain the right to participate in the Security Council meeting, they must first comply with the illegal decision previously passed by the Security Council.

　　Regarding Jebb's opinion – that the Chairman of the Security Council should follow the precedent established by the previous chairman and invite Rhee Syngman's representative to participate – Malik said that he had followed the precedent, but because of the opposition from the Soviet delegation, he, as Chairman, could only present this opposition to the Council.

　　French representative Chauvel said: Jebb's statement that there was no precedent for inviting North Korean representatives was incorrect. Yugoslavia had indeed made this suggestion on June 25th, but the suggestion was rejected.

　　Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu then repeated that the decision to invite the Rhee Syngman "government" had already been passed, and therefore, the Security Council did not need to put this issue to a vote again.

　　Jiang Tingfu said that he absolutely "disagreed with the chairman's ruling" regarding the separate voting on the invitation of representatives from both North and South Korea. Regarding this point, Malik said: No ruling has yet been made. There are only two suggestions – the Soviet suggestion to invite both parties and the British suggestion to vote separately – first to vote on inviting South Korea, and then to vote on inviting North Korea.

　　Egyptian representative Fawzi asked Malik to explain the purpose of the Soviet suggestion. Malik replied: The Soviet delegation has put forward a suggestion aimed at a peaceful resolution, therefore, it is believed that the substance of the issue clearly shows that inviting both parties is key to the issue, because when dealing with all issues related to the cessation of hostilities, the Security Council should invite both parties. Rejecting this suggestion is tantamount to refusing to facilitate the cessation of hostilities.

　　Norwegian representative Sunde then spoke. He agreed with Jiang Tingfu's opinion that the issue of inviting South Korea had been resolved. Sunde also said that during his tenure as Chairman of the Security Council, he had invited the Korean representative without consulting the Council members. Malik asked Sunde: If there had been objections at the time, would he have brought this issue to the Council?

　　At this point, Indian representative Rau stood up to speak. He said that the first suggestion – inviting the South Korean representative – had been resolved on June 25th after the United States made the suggestion without objection. Rau said, therefore, the issue is not whether it is necessary to invite the representative of the Republic of Korea, but whether it is necessary to cancel this invitation. As for the invitation to the Korean people that has been proposed, Rau said: He finds it difficult to vote on this suggestion. He said that if the words "Korean people" and "North Korean authorities" mean the same thing, it means inviting those who have been deemed guilty of aggression in resolutions supported by the Security Council in India. If the words "Korean people" mean something else, then the question arises: how can they be commissioned? Rau said, therefore, I cannot vote on this issue without government instructions, and if anyone insists on voting immediately, I will abstain from voting.

　　Egyptian representative Fawzi also said that the term "representative of the Korean people" is not very clear. As for the Soviet suggestion to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China, Fawzi said that he could not vote in favor of this invitation.

　　British representative Jebb was willing to "propose an amendment" to his previous suggestion regarding separate voting on the invitation of South and North Korean representatives. Jebb advocated two votes, but "agreed" with the opinions of the Norwegian and Indian representatives, that is, regarding South Korea, the issue of canceling the previously proposed invitation should be voted on.

　　In response to the argument that the Security Council had decided to invite representatives of the Rhee Syngman group on June 25th, Malik pointed out that this was the convention of the Security Council when taking decisions on such invitations at each meeting. Usually, the Chairman suggests inviting a representative of a certain country to participate in the Security Council meeting, and then the Security Council decides whether to make such an invitation.

　　Therefore, Malik said, I cannot agree that the invitation to the South Korean group on June 25th was permanent. The Soviet delegation opposes inviting the South Korean representative to attend without inviting the North Korean representative. Malik pointed out that the decision on June 25th was illegal because it was passed without the participation of the two permanent members of the Security Council, the Soviet Union and China. The decision on June 25th was also unfair because the Security Council only listened to one side. The Soviet Union has every right to demand that the Security Council also listen to the other side.

　　When talking about the Security Council considering the issue of disputes that may cause far-reaching consequences for peaceful resolution, Malik said, however, some delegations have tried to prevent North Korean representatives from presenting their views.

　　Malik concluded that the Soviet opinion is that in order to make a fair decision, the belligerent parties in Korea must be invited to participate. Because one of the members of the Security Council cannot vote without government orders, the Security Council should adjourn to meet on Tuesday.

　　The Security Council passed this suggestion.

### 马立克代表苏联在安理会提出提案  主张停止朝鲜战事撤出外国军队  邀我国出席及朝鲜代表参加讨论  强调和平解决朝鲜问题必须邀交战双方参加会议

　　马立克代表苏联在安理会提出提案
    主张停止朝鲜战事撤出外国军队
    邀我国出席及朝鲜代表参加讨论
    强调和平解决朝鲜问题必须邀交战双方参加会议
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社纽约五日讯：安理会于四日在马立克担任主席下举行会议，讨论三日会议在休会之前所通过的议程。议程上仅有美国所提出的一项——“控诉对大韩民国侵略案”。
    马立克在宣读议程后宣称：在讨论实质问题之前，他要代表苏联提出一个提案，名为“和平解决朝鲜问题案”。该案称：“安理会决议：（一）认为有必要邀请中华人民共和国的代表，并在讨论朝鲜问题时听取朝鲜人民代表陈述意见；（二）停止朝鲜境内的战事，并同时自朝鲜撤出外国军队。”
    国民党代表蒋廷黻称：在作进一步讨论以前，应邀请所谓“大韩民国”的代表列席安理会会议。
    埃及代表法齐称：现在存在着安理会六月二十五日的“有效决议”，其中决定邀请“大韩民国代表”出席。法齐称：安理会应继续遵守这个成例。
    马立克以苏联代表的资格发言称：苏联代表团认为朝鲜的情况是一个内战。因此，在苏联的提案中包括着这样一点，即：安理会应邀请朝鲜人民的代表参加。他说：为了停止朝鲜境内类似战争的行动，就必须邀请双方。这就是安理会在讨论譬如巴勒斯坦问题及印尼问题时的惯例与传统。不管双方是否安理会的理事国，双方都受到邀请。事实上，安理会曾邀请各国政府间的组织——阿拉伯最高委员会参加讨论了巴勒斯坦问题。
    马立克进一步说：因为安理会将要讨论美国的提案，而这提案却控告它之所谓“北朝鲜当局”进行侵略，所以要是拒绝听取双方发言，就是不公正而且是不能容许的。马立克说：必须听取两个政府阵营双方代表发言。因此，苏联建议邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国——与若干国家保持着外交关系的国家——的代表参加。安理会决不可一方面听任在反对所谓“北朝鲜当局”的行动过程中城市遭轰炸、人民遭惨杀的情况存在，另一方面却拒绝听取“北朝鲜当局”发言。
    马立克接着指出：如果没有反对的话，安理会主席通常总是邀请争端的双方参加，不然的话，这个问题就付诸讨论。他又说：苏联代表团认为这是实质的问题，不是程序的问题，因为问题是战争或和平的问题。
    国民党代表蒋廷黻声称：在安理会就苏联代表的提议采取决定以前，应该邀请南朝鲜的代表，以符合从前的决定。
    美国代表奥斯汀继而发表演说，指责安理会主席马立克，硬说他采取了非惯常的程序。奥斯汀提到苏联提案的本文说，这项提案“超出议事日程的范围”。奥斯汀说，美国代表团要求主席邀请大韩民国出席，因为这个问题在上次安理会会议上已经决定。奥斯汀继称，联合国曾宣布李承晚政府为代表朝鲜的唯一的政府。奥斯汀结语说，美国政府认为不应邀请北朝鲜代表参加讨论。
    马立克在回答奥斯汀的话时，提醒他说，苏联建议乃是苏联代表团所提出的，如果奥斯汀反对它的话，他的反对意见应向苏联代表团申述，而不应向安理会主席申述。马立克又说，“我再说一遍，苏联代表团提出建议，要求交战双方的代表参加安理会会议。”对于奥斯汀其他的说话，马立克说，他保留权利，以后再回答。
    接着，英国代表杰伯提议，苏联建议中所包括的两个问题应予分开，然后分别表决。他说，安理会首先应当表决邀请南朝鲜代表参加安理会会议的建议，其次决定北朝鲜代表是否应予邀请。根据杰伯的意见，正因为安理会以前已邀请南朝鲜代表参加安理会会议，所以这种事情的先例，可以使他得以继续参加以后所有关于同样问题的会议。然而杰伯承认，安理会并非自动地有义务根据这种先例允许南朝鲜代表参加。他说，因为这种原故，安理会必须首先表决这一问题。
    杰伯更进一步声言，邀请北朝鲜代表参加的问题则完全不同，因为北朝鲜的代表已经和联合国处在对立的地位。这样，杰伯事实上即是要求，如果北朝鲜代表要取得参加安理会会议的权利，首先就要遵从安理会前此通过的非法决定。
    关于杰伯的这种意见——即安理会主席应遵循前任主席确立的先例，邀请李承晚的代表参加，马立克说，他已经遵循了先例，但是，因为苏联代表团方面的反对，他以主席的身份只能把这一反对意见向理事会提出。
    法国代表萧维尔说：杰伯说没有邀请北朝鲜代表的先例，这个意见是不正确的，南斯拉夫确曾在六月二十五日提出过这种建议，不过这一建议被否决了而已。
    国民党代表蒋廷黻接着重复说，邀请李承晚“政府”的决定已经通过，因此，安理会无须把这问题再付表决。
    蒋廷黻说，关于分别表决邀请北朝鲜与南朝鲜两方代表的问题，他绝对“不同意主席的裁决”。关于这一点，马立克说：还不曾作出任何裁决，只有两种建议——苏联建议邀请双方和英国所提分别投票的建议——首先表决邀请南朝鲜的问题，然后再表决邀请北朝鲜的问题。
    埃及代表法齐要求马立克解释苏联建议案的目的。马立克答称：苏联代表团已提出其目的在于和平解决的建议案，因此，认为问题的实质已明白显示邀请双方正是问题关键所在，因为处理有关停止敌对行动的一切问题时，安理会应邀请双方。拒绝这个建议就是拒绝便利敌对行动之停止。
    挪威代表森德继起发言。他同意蒋廷黻的意见说：邀请南朝鲜的问题已经解决。森德又说他在安理会主席任内曾经没有征询各理事的意见便邀请朝鲜代表。马立克问森德道：假如当时有反对意见的话，他是否会已经向理事会提出这个问题。
    至此，印度代表劳氏起立发言。他说，第一个建议——邀请南朝鲜代表——在美国提出建议而无反对意见之后，已于六月二十五日获得解决。劳氏说，所以，问题不在于是否需要邀请大韩民国代表，而是在于是否需要取消这项邀请。至于业已提出的对朝鲜人民的邀请，劳氏说：他难以对这个建议投票。他说，如果“朝鲜人民”这几个字与“北朝鲜当局”意味着同一回事，这就是说邀请被安理会在印度所支持的决议中认为犯侵略罪的那些人。如果“朝鲜人民”这几个字意味着别的，那么问题便来了，就是：他们如何能得到委任呢。劳氏说，因此，我未得政府训令不能对这问题投票，如果任何人坚持立刻表决，我将不参加表决。
    埃及代表法齐又说，“朝鲜人民的代表”一辞意义不十分清楚。至于苏联建议邀请中华人民共和国代表，法齐说，他不能投票赞成这个邀请。
    英国代表杰伯愿对他先前所提的关于分别表决邀请南朝鲜与北朝鲜代表的建议“提出修正案”。杰伯主张两次表决，不过“同意”挪威与印度代表的意见，即关于南朝鲜，应该对前些时候所提出的邀请的取消问题加以表决。
    在答复关于六月二十五日安理会曾决定邀请李承晚集团的代表的论据时，马立克指出，这是安理会在每次会议对这种邀请采取决定时的常规。通常是由主席建议邀请某一国家的代表参加安理会会议，然后安理会决定是否提出这种邀请。
    因此，马立克说，我不能同意六月二十五日对南朝鲜集团的邀请是永久性的。苏联代表团反对不邀请北朝鲜代表出席而邀请南朝鲜代表出席。马立克指出六月二十五日的决定是非法的，因为这个决定通过时没有苏联与中国两个常任理事国参加。六月二十五日的决定也是不公平的，因为安理会只听取了一方面的意见。苏联有充分的权利要求安理会也听取另一方面的发言。
    在谈到安理会在考虑和平解决可能引起长远后果的争论的问题时，马立克说，不过，有某些代表团却曾设法不让北朝鲜代表们提出他们的意见。
    马立克结语说，苏联的意见认为：要作公平的决定，必须邀请朝鲜的交战双方参加。因为安理会的会员国之一不能未奉政府的命令而进行投票，所以，安理会以展期星期二开会为宜。
    安全理事会通过了这一建议。
