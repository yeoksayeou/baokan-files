　　Heilongjiang Xinhua Bookstore Conducts Rectification

　　Examines Shortcomings in Distribution Work

　　Book and Journal Supply Unplanned, Failure to Unite Booksellers

　　[Our Newspaper] The Heilongjiang Branch of Xinhua Bookstore recently conducted rectification study and work examination, and convened a joint meeting of managers of county branches to examine the work of the branch stores. The work of Heilongjiang Province's Xinhua Bookstore has been successful. There are currently thirty-eight branch stores in the province. Except for the inaccessible Heihe area, the rest have been unified, overcoming the past situation of independent operation. Since last year, various branch stores have sent personnel deep into the countryside to assist in organizing libraries. This year, they have also begun to organize district and township sales agencies. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work that must be further improved.

　　First, there is still a state of anarchy and lack of planning in the work. In terms of book and journal supply, it is always not timely and cannot meet the readers' requirements. For example, last year's winter school textbooks were not only delayed, but the survey and estimation were also insufficient. Many places were in short supply, and there were not enough textbooks for winter school students, which affected the development of winter schools. This spring, when distributing elementary school textbooks, the provincial branch subjectively reported the numbers filled in by various counties at an 80% discount to the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore, which also resulted in a phenomenon that did not meet actual needs. The same is true for general books and journals. Some readers reflected: "Whatever book you want, the Xinhua Bookstore never has it. The Xinhua Bookstore's books are always a step behind." There is serious blindness in the allocation of books and journals. There is not enough daily understanding of the readers' needs and the sales volume of past general books. For example, some branches wanted a lot of hardcover "Cadre's Must-Reads," which accumulated a large amount of inventory, affecting capital turnover. Because of the lack of overall planning when allocating certain books and journals, unnecessary "book travel" was created. Some branches also have purely economic viewpoints, pushing old and unsuitable books for farmers to rural libraries. Individual branches even violate the instructions of their superiors, arbitrarily manage stationery, increase the price of books, or privately use public funds.

　　Second, the branch store's work on each branch store is limited to general written arrangements and appeals, and specific guidance and supervision are not enough. For example, the organization of rural libraries last year and the organization of district and township sales agencies this year, the branch store did not conduct key experiments to absorb experience and promote it comprehensively, and the inspection and supervision were not enough. It simply arranged numbers without detailing the methods for completing the tasks, so some areas produced formalism, simply putting some books in the village and finishing the job; some areas have not yet paid attention to this work, such as the libraries and cultural stations in Tongbei County that have not been established. The internal work system of the branch store is not strict, there are no detailed work rules, and the responsibility system and reward and punishment system have not been seriously established. As a result, the purchase section and the branch store work section are not clearly divided, and some work is disconnected from each other, resulting in a phenomenon where no one is responsible. Cadres who work actively have not received the rewards and commendations they deserve, and cadres who are not responsible for their work have not been criticized and corrected in a timely manner.

　　Third, no attention has been paid to uniting the work of private bookstores. There are no independently operated publishing private bookstores in Heilongjiang Province. The Xinhua Bookstore has taken a laissez-faire attitude towards some book vendors and book stalls, allowing them to fend for themselves. In Beian, Suihua, and other places, some private bookstores volunteered to sell books on consignment, but the branch managers felt that "it is not appropriate to let private bookstores sell on consignment." Others felt that giving private merchants discounts was a "pity," and the wholesale conditions were very harsh.

　　The main reasons for the above shortcomings are the bureaucracy of the leading cadres. On the one hand, they believe that the situation in Heilongjiang Province is special, and they do not study the instructions of the superiors on publishing and distribution work carefully. On the other hand, they do not do enough research, so they blindly generate complacency and exclude private merchants. Some cadres lack a mass perspective, are not proactive in their sales methods, and do not have a spirit of serving readers wholeheartedly, believing that state-owned bookstores are agencies, "you can buy it if you want, and if you don't want to, that's it." Some even feel that selling books is "shameful" and that "there is no future in working in a bookstore," so they are not at ease with their work. After this inspection, the main problems have been largely found. In the future, we will continue to conduct in-depth inspections, focusing on key issues, finding principles, and devising ways to correct shortcomings and promote work.

　　黑龙江新华书店进行整风
    检查发行工作缺点
    书刊供应无计划，未注意团结书商
    【本报讯】新华书店黑龙江分店最近进行了整风学习与工作检查，并召开了各县支店经理联席会议，检查了分、支店的工作。黑龙江省新华书店的工作是有成绩的，全省现有支店三十八个，除交通不便的黑河地区以外，其余已全部统一，克服了过去独立经营的状况。去年来各支店派员深入农村，协助组织图书室，今年又开始了组织区、乡代销站工作。但工作中还有许多缺点，必须继续改进。
    第一，工作上还有无政府、无计划状态。在书刊供应上，总是不及时，不能满足读者的要求。如去年的冬学课本，不但拖得很晚，而且调查、估计不足，许多地方供不应求，冬学学员的课本不够用，影响了冬学的开展。今春发行小学课本，省分店主观地将各县填报的数字打八折报告东北新华书店，也产生了不符实际需要的现象。一般书刊也是如此。有些读者反映：“要什么书，新华书店就是没什么书。新华书店的书总是马后炮。”在书刊调拨上存在着严重的盲目性。日常对于读者需要与过去一般书籍的销售量了解不够。如精装的《干部必读》，有些支店要得很多，积压了大批存货，影响了资金周转。某些书刊因为调拨时无通盘计划，造成不必要的“图书旅行”。还有某些支店有单纯的经济观点，将破旧书籍和不适合农民需要的书籍推给农村图书馆。个别支店更有违反上级指示，擅自经营文具、加价出售书籍或私自动用公款的。
    第二，分店对各支店的工作，仅限于一般书面的布置与号召，而具体指导与督促检查不够。如去年组织农村图书室与今年组织区、乡代销站工作，分店既未作重点试验，吸取经验来全面推广，检查督促也不够。只是单纯地布置数字，没有详细交待完成任务的方法，因此有的地区产生形式主义，将一些书放到村上就完事；有的地区还没有重视这一工作，如通北县的图书室与文化站都未建立起来。分店内部工作制度也不严密，没有工作细则，责任制和奖惩制度都未认真建立。因之进货股与支店工作股分工不清，有的工作彼此脱节，发生无人负责的现象。积极工作的干部没有受到应有的奖励与表扬，工作不负责任的干部也未及时加以批评纠正。
    第三，没有注意团结私营书店的工作。黑龙江省没有独立经营出版事业的私营书店，新华书店对一些贩书业和书摊，采取了坐视不理，任其自生自灭的态度。北安、绥化等地，有些私营书店自愿代销书籍，但支店经理认为“给私营书店代销不像回事”。有的则觉得给私商折扣“可惜”，批发条件很苛。
    产生上述缺点的原因，主要是领导干部的官僚主义，一方面认为黑龙江省情况特殊，对上级关于出版、发行工作的指示研究不认真，一方面对调查研究工作做得不够，因此盲目地产生自满情绪和排挤私商的现象。一部分干部缺乏群众观点，在推销方法上不主动，没有认真为读者服务的精神，认为国营书店是机关，“你愿买就买，不买就算”。有的甚至觉得推销书籍“丢脸子”，“做书店工作没有前途”，因而不安心工作。经过此次检查后，大体找到了主要问题，今后将继续深入检查，着重关键性问题，找出原则，想出办法来改正缺点，推进工作。
