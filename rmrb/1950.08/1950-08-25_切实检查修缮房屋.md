　　Conscientiously Inspect and Repair Houses
    Beijing has had a lot of rain this summer, and many houses that have been in disrepair for years have collapsed due to rain erosion. On August 2nd and 3rd alone, nearly four thousand houses collapsed in the city, injuring sixty-four citizens and killing six. House collapses also occurred in various government agencies and schools. When the barbershop of the National Beijing Normal University collapsed, one worker and one student were injured. These house collapses should attract our great attention.
    The reason for the post-rain house collapses is mainly that the houses have been in disrepair for many years. On the one hand, this is because the vast majority of citizens lived in poverty under the long-term oppression of reactionary rule and could not afford to repair their houses. On the other hand, it is because the unreasonable housing rental relationship has not been resolved for many years, which has affected the disrepair of houses. In addition, the city's sewers and moats have not been dredged for many years, resulting in poor drainage, which has caused many foundations to be eroded and damaged by water.
    Since liberation, the Municipal People's Government has done a lot of work in response to the above situation. For example, it has vigorously dredged and excavated sewers and moats, inspected houses throughout the city, helped households whose houses are in danger of collapsing to move, and organized housing repair committees in various districts to repair houses and solve drainage problems. These measures are correct and necessary, but they are not enough. In particular, the relevant departments' inspection of houses and mobilization of citizens to repair houses are not universal, serious, or practical enough. In this regard, we hope that the housing repair committees and relevant departments that have been established in various districts of Beijing will concentrate their efforts. Not only should they publicize to the citizens to raise awareness, but they should also quickly assist the citizens in solving various specific problems and difficulties in housing repair. For households whose houses are in danger of collapsing but are temporarily unable to repair them, they should be patiently persuaded and helped to move to avoid the danger of life.
    The administrative departments cannot shirk their responsibility for the collapse of houses in government agencies and schools. Although financial resources are currently limited, government agencies and schools cannot build a large number of houses, but the inspection and repair of existing houses should be and can be done. The reason why problems occur is mostly due to administrative procrastination and negligence in peacetime, and failure to seriously inspect and repair houses. For example, the student dining hall of National Beijing Normal University collapsed once in June this year, but the school's administrative authorities did not raise their vigilance, which resulted in the unfortunate incident of the barbershop collapsing and injuring students and workers on August 7. This fact should attract the attention of all departments, and thorough and serious inspection and repair should be carried out on dilapidated houses.

### 切实检查修缮房屋

　　切实检查修缮房屋
    北京今夏多雨，年久失修的房屋，因雨水浸蚀，倒塌的很多。仅八月二、三两日，全市倒塌的房屋将近四千间，伤市民六十四人，死六人。各机关学校亦发生房屋倒塌事件。国立北京师范大学理发室倒塌时，伤工友、学生各一人。这些房屋倒塌的情况，应引起我们极大的注意。
    雨后塌房的原因，主要是房屋年久失修。这一方面是由于广大市民，过去在反动统治的长期压榨下生活贫困，无力修缮，一方面是因为多年来不合理的房屋租赁关系还没有解决，影响到房屋失修。加上市内的下水道及护城河多年未加疏浚，排水不畅，使许多房基被水浸蚀败坏。
    解放以来，市人民政府针对上述情况，曾作了不少的工作。如大力疏浚与掏挖下水道和护城河，检查全市房屋，帮助房屋有倒塌危险的住户搬家，各区组织房屋修缮委员会进行房屋的修缮，并解决排水等问题。这些措施是正确的，必要的，但还作得不够。特别是有关部门对房屋的检查工作及动员市民修缮房屋的工作，还作得不普遍、不认真、不切实。在这方面，我们希望北京市各区已成立的房屋修缮委员会和有关部门，集中力量来进行。不但要向市民宣传，引起警惕；并应迅速协助市民解决房屋修缮中的各种具体问题和困难。对于房屋有倒塌危险而一时无力修缮的住户，应耐心说服，帮助他们搬家，以免发生性命危险。
    机关学校房屋的倒塌，各该行政部门是不能推卸责任的。目前虽限于财力，各机关学校还不能大量修建房屋，但对原有房屋的检查、修缮是应该的和可能作到的。问题之所以发生，多半是由于行政上平日因循懈怠，对房屋不认真检查修缮。如国立北京师范大学，今年六月学生饭厅曾倒塌过一次，但该校行政当局并未引起警惕，以致造成八月七日理发室倒塌砸伤学生工友的不幸事件。这个事实，应当引起各个部门的注意，对破旧房屋应当进行切实认真的检查与修缮。
