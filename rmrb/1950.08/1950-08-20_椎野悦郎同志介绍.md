　　Introducing Comrade Etsuro Shiino
　　He lost both parents in childhood and was raised by his aunt. His adoptive father organized one of the most famous events in the history of the Japanese revolutionary movement, the "Rice Riots," in his hometown's mine, and died in prison as a result. His elder brother and uncles were also involved in this event—Comrade Shiino grew up in this kind of family atmosphere.
　　At the age of eighteen, he was active as an organizer in his hometown's mine under the guidance of the then "Red Labor Union League." At that time, the Japanese revolution was in an extremely illegal state, but he was able to organize the most famous strike in the coal mine struggle, the 1931 Chikuho Coal Mine Strike, demonstrating outstanding talent and mobilizing tens of thousands of people to participate in this struggle. He spent most of the war years in prison. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he was imprisoned in the Tokyo Detention House along with Tokuda, Shiga, and others, serving as an instructor in the prison's Party branch guidance department. He is currently the Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party's Control Commission. After all members of the JCP Central Committee were purged, he was also promoted to Chairman of the new leadership.

    十八岁时就在家乡矿山，在当时的“赤色劳动工合联盟”指导之下，作为一个组织者而从事活动。这时日本的革命处在极端非法的状态下，但他却能组织了煤矿斗争中最有名的一九三一年的筑丰煤矿罢工，表现了卓越的才能，动员了几万群众参加这个斗争。战争期间的大部时间都在狱中过生活。太平洋战争爆发后，便和德田、志贺等一起、被关在东京预防拘禁所，担任着狱中党支部指导部的指导员。现任日本共产党监察委员会主席，日共中央委员会全部委员被整肃后又被推兼任新指导部主席。
