　　Question and Answer

　　Q: The National Industry and Commerce Bureau Conference in May suggested establishing investment companies in major cities across the country. It is recently heard that the Beijing Xingye Investment Company has begun raising shares. What are the purpose and nature of this organization?
                                         (Wang Jinzhi)
    A: The purpose of organizing investment companies is, under the leadership of state-owned financial institutions, to pool private capital and rationally and fully utilize it in productive enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and have development prospects, so as to benefit the restoration and development of the social economy. The company's funds will be 20% to 30% borne by the National Bank, with the remainder invested by private banks and money shops, and finally publicly soliciting other private funds from the public; its main business is to invest in important productive enterprises, underwrite company bonds issued by industrial, mining, transportation, and public utility enterprises, act as an agent for raising company bonds and stocks issued by the above-mentioned enterprises, and act as an agent for distributing dividends and bond principal and interest, etc.; in addition to distributing dividends and bonuses in accordance with regulations in years when the company has a surplus, investors can also enjoy a pre-set 6% dividend in years without a surplus, to be compensated for in years with a surplus.
    Such an organization is beneficial to economic recovery and development:
    First, for industry and commerce: In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, China's industry and commerce generally suffered from the depletion of working capital due to malignant inflation and bloated enterprise structures. After the unification of finance and economy and the stabilization of prices, the operation of industry and commerce gradually returned to normal from abnormal conditions, and the need to replenish the working capital of industry and commerce became more urgent, and at the same time, the conditions for meeting this need began to be available. The organization of investment companies is to pool public and private capital to meet this need, so as to increase the working capital of industry and commerce and help its transformation and development. Therefore, industrialists and businessmen are extremely interested in this organization.
    Second, for investors: At present, there is still a portion of capital in society—first of all, capital from industry and commerce that wants to change careers, secondly, capital from returned overseas Chinese, and also capital that was used for speculation in the past—, which is hesitant, fearful, and has no way out, given the difficulties of industry and commerce during the adjustment period; investment companies also solve this difficulty for them and provide clear guarantees.
    Third, for private banks and money shops: The establishment of investment companies not only provides the money industry with a direction for the use of long-term deposits, but also allows banks to achieve the purpose of long-term investment through the use of short-term funds because investment company shares can be transferred at any time. Therefore, this organization has a future.
    Q: Currently, private industrial and commercial enterprises in various regions are actively engaged in "joint operations." How does this business operation method differ from monopolistic organizations in capitalist society, such as trusts and cartels? What is its role in overcoming the current difficulties of private industrial and commercial enterprises? (Li Wenhai)
    A: Since April and May of this year, after the government began to rationally adjust existing industry and commerce, "joint operation" organizations have been gradually promoted in many private industrial and commercial enterprises (including the financial industry and import and export trade) in major cities. In the New Democratic economy, this kind of joint operation organization of private industrial and commercial enterprises is different from various monopolistic organizations in capitalist society. First of all, various "monopolistic organizations" in capitalist society are the result of the increasing accumulation and concentration of capital during the development of capitalism, and the implementation of a merger policy by a few large capitalist groups. In the New Democratic economy, however, "joint operation" is organized consciously and automatically and in accordance with the principle of voluntarism in order to overcome the current difficulties of private industrial and commercial enterprises.
    Secondly, in capitalist society, the various monopolistic organizations of large capitalists are mainly for the purpose of monopolizing the market and manipulating prices in order to maintain monopolistic profits. Our current situation is that small and medium-sized enterprises are in the majority, generally with weak capital, simple equipment, backward technology, sporadic products, and scattered management. Therefore, through joint operation, it is possible to gradually achieve: (1) concentrating capital, manpower and experience, and making fuller and more rational use of existing equipment, so as to improve productivity; (2) avoiding competitive purchasing and selling, reducing operating expenses and intermediate exploitation through joint purchasing and joint sales, so that private industrial and commercial enterprises gradually move towards organized and planned operation; (3) uniting private enterprises around state-owned enterprises, so as to obtain the latter's leadership and assistance; (4) organizing, gradually unifying product specifications, improving quality, and further improving production technology and business management, and reducing production costs. In the past few months, according to the actual experience of various industries in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Shenyang, Nanjing, and Hangzhou in organizing "joint operations," it has been proven that it can indeed solve some difficult problems in private industrial and commercial enterprises.
    The inevitable consequence of various monopolistic organizations in capitalist society is more intense infighting and competition among various capitalist groups, and deepening economic panic and war crisis. The "joint operation" of private industrial and commercial enterprises in the New Democratic society, however, gradually reduces the state of anarchy in production and distribution under the leadership and assistance of the national economy, becoming a favorable condition for private industrial and commercial enterprises to overcome difficulties and carry out maintenance, restoration and development, and at the same time, it is also conducive to the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises.

　　问题解答
    问：五月间全国工商局长会议，曾建议在全国各大城市设立投资公司，近闻北京兴业投资公司已在开始募股，这一组织的目的与性质，究竟是怎样的？
                                         （王今之）
    答：投资公司组织的目的，是在国营金融业的领导下，集合私人资金，合理而充分地运用到有利于国计民生并有发展前途的生产事业上去，以利于恢复并发展社会经济。公司的资金将有百分之二十至三十由国家银行负担，余由私营银钱业投入，最后并向社会公开招募其他私人资金；其业务主要是投资于重要的生产事业、承受工矿交通公用事业发行的公司债、代募上述企业发行的公司债与股票、代发股息与债券本息等等；投资人，除于公司有盈余之年照章分配股息、红利外，并可在无盈余的年度内，预先享受六厘的股息待有盈余之年归补。
    这样一个组织对于经济的恢复与发展是有益的：
    第一、对工商业来说：我国工商业过去在国民党反动统治下，由于恶性通货膨胀、企业机构臃肿，一般都有流动资金枯竭的病象。财经统一与物价趋稳后，工商业的经营由反常而渐回复正常，充实工商业流动资金的需要更见殷切，同时也才开始具备了可能满足它需要的条件，投资公司的组织，就是要集合公私资金，满足这种需要，俾增加工商业的流动资金并帮助其改造与发展，因此工商业家对于这种组织是都极感兴趣的。
    第二、对于投资人来说：目前社会上还有一部分资金——首先是工商业中想转业的资金、其次是回国的华侨资金、还有过去作投机用的资金——，因鉴于工商业在调整期内的困难，便彷徨、畏惧、苦无出路；投资公司也替他们解决了此一困难，且有明确的保障。
    第三、对于私营银钱业来说：投资公司的成立，不仅使银钱业的长期存款多一运用的方向，且因投资公司的股票可随时转让，故银行亦可借短期资金的运用，达到长期投资的目的。因此这一组织是有前途的。
    问：目前各地私营工商业方面纷纷进行“联营”，这一企业经营方式和资本主义社会的独占组织，如托拉斯、卡特尔等有什么不同？对于克服目前私营工商业的困难有什么作用？（李文海）
    答：本年四五月间，政府着手合理地调整现有工商业以后，“联营”组织便在各大城市里不少私营工商业中（包括金融业和出进口贸易在内）逐步推行。在新民主主义经济中，私营工商业的这种联营组织与资本主义社会的各种独占组织是有区别的。首先，资本主义社会的各种“独占组织”，是在资本主义发展过程中，由于资本日益集积和集中，少数大资本家集团实行兼并政策的结果。而在新民主主义经济下，“联营”却是为了克服目前私营工商业的困难，自觉自动的并且依照自愿原则组织起来的。
    其次，在资本主义社会里，大资本家的各种独占组织主要是为了垄断市场，操纵物价，以维持独占利润我们目前的情况是中小型企业居多，一般都是资金薄弱，设备简陋，技术落后，产品零星以及经营散漫等等。因此通过联营，可以逐步作到：（一）集中资金、人力和经验，更充分合理的利用现有设备，以提高生产力；（二）通过联购、联销，避免竞购竞卖，减少经营费用和中间剥削，使私营工商业逐步走向有组织有计划的经营；（三）将私营企业团结在国营企业的周围，以便取得后者的领导和帮助；（四）组织起来，逐步划一产品规格，提高品质，并进而改进生产技术和经营管理，降低生产成本。在过去几个月内，根据上海、天津、北京、沈阳、南京以及杭州等地组织“联营”各个行业的实际经验，证明确能解决了私营工商业中若干困难问题。
    资本主义社会各种独占组织所造成的必然的后果，是各资本家集团间更强烈的倾轧和竞争，加深经济恐慌和战争危机。新民主主义社会中的私营工商业的“联营”，却是在国家经济领导和帮助下逐步减少生产和分配的无政府状态，成为目前私营工商业克服困难，进行维持、恢复和发展的一个有利条件，同时，也有利于私营工商业的改造。
