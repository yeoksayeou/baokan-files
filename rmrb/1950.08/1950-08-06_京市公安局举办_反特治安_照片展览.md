The Beijing Public Security Bureau Holds
"Anti-Espionage and Security" Photo Exhibition

　　In May and June, the Beijing Public Security Bureau held photo exhibitions on "Labor Reform of Special Agents" and "Preventing Espionage and Fire, Safeguarding Production and Construction." The number of visitors was extremely high, exceeding 100,000. In particular, the anti-espionage and fire prevention exhibition was well received by the workers when it toured various factories. After seeing it, they became highly vigilant against enemy agents sabotaging production and construction, strengthened the inspection of factory security work and fire protection work, and requested the Public Security Bureau to hold such exhibitions regularly. According to the opinions and requests of the masses, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has revised and supplemented these two parts of the pictures, and added a part of the materials about social security work to form a comprehensive anti-espionage and security exhibition, which will be held in the water pavilion of Zhongshan Park from today. The bureau has also arranged with Zhongshan Park that agencies and organizations with letters of introduction can enter the park for free to visit.

　　京市公安局举办
    “反特治安”照片展览
    京市公安局在五、六月份中，曾先后举办过“劳动改造特务”及“防特、防火保卫生产建设”等图片展览。参观人数极为踊跃，约在十万人以上。尤其当防特防火展览到各工厂去巡回举行时，更博得了工人弟兄们的欢迎。他们看过以后，都引起了对敌特破坏生产建设的高度警惕，加强了工厂保卫工作、消防工作的检查；同时要求公安局能经常举办这种展览。市公安局根据群众的意见与要求，现将这两部分图片加以修正和补充，并增添了关于社会治安工作的一部分材料，综合组成反特治安展览，即日起在中山公园水榭举行。该局业与中山公园治舀，各机关团体持有介绍信者可免费入园参观。
