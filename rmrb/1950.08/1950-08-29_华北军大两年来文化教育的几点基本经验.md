Several Basic Experiences in Cultural Education at the North China Military and Political University in the Past Two Years

　　Since starting the cultural refresher school in May of last year, our school's cultural education has gradually and comprehensively developed. Up to now, 853 serving cadres, 2,300 company-level students, and 2,651 soldiers and staff members have participated in cultural learning. Among these comrades, the least have learned 200 characters, and nearly 200 people have reached the level of elementary school graduation. Furthermore, 246 cultural instructors have been trained; 15 kinds of teaching materials have been compiled. In the course of the past two years, we have accumulated the following experiences:

　　1. The key to carrying out cultural education lies first in the correct understanding of this work by leaders at all levels, truly regarding it as a major historical and political task, and providing practical leadership and guarantees in actual work. Generally speaking, our leaders at all levels attach importance to cultural and educational work, which has played a decisive role in the development of cultural education. However, the facts also tell us that some Party committees, branches, and some leading cadres still have, to varying degrees, an incorrect view of cultural education, thinking that it is only an auxiliary education, "Just learn to recognize a few characters and be able to do some accounting!" It seems to be dispensable. Therefore, in actual work, it has not been given the due attention. Individual leaders even hold a contemptuous attitude, which greatly limits the development of cultural education. This is more evident in the work of cultural refresher schools.

　　2. Based on the needs of the development of the situation and the subjective and objective conditions that have been met, we deeply feel that the policy put forward by the military region—that the current cultural education construction must adopt the principle of standardization and accelerated training—is correct. The so-called standardization is, first of all, to formulate a comprehensive plan based on the educational requirements and the actual situation of the troops, and to conduct teaching systematically, step-by-step, and purposefully. At the same time, a set of teaching organizations and systems should be established, and unified teaching materials should be compiled and printed. The so-called accelerated training is to appropriately simplify the teaching content under the principle of standardization, based on the needs and possibilities of the troops, in order to shorten the entire teaching time and achieve the goal of completing the study period of primary and secondary school levels as soon as possible. To implement this policy, it is currently necessary to correct the following two deviations in understanding: (1) The idea of being eager for quick success. This idea does not understand that cultural knowledge is accumulated bit by bit and gradually improved. "Haste" and "jumping" will not only fail to solve the problem but will also lead to detours and generate a feeling of discouragement. (2) Some leaders and students inappropriately emphasize "practicality," thinking that what is learned must be used immediately, otherwise, it is considered "unnecessary." For example, in the past, individual responsible comrades of the artillery battalion advocated that the trigonometry of artillery should only be learned eighteen times to solve the problem, which is wrong. This is nearsightedness in teaching. It is not understood that improving culture in the army today is not only about learning to write letters, keep diaries, issue notes, and calculate "tofu accounts" (of course, these should all be learned), but it is necessary to achieve a more comprehensive and systematic improvement, but not a "college-style" improvement, to lay the foundation for further learning of military theory and military technology.

　　3. Two basic links must be grasped in teaching methods:

　　First, it is necessary to be good at adopting appropriate methods according to the characteristics of the teaching objects, that is to say, to proceed from objective reality and not rely on subjective wishes. Generally speaking, the characteristics of our teaching objects and the main points that should be paid attention to in teaching methods are roughly: (1) Most of the students are adults, with considerable social experience and revolutionary struggle experience, a certain level of political understanding, and a relatively strong ability to understand, but they are older and have a poorer memory. Therefore, in teaching methods, we must adopt the principle of less lecturing and more practice, so as to achieve proficiency and consolidation through practice, and avoid "spoon-feeding" teaching methods. At the same time, since students have a strong ability to understand and judge, teachers must explain the principles that can be understood clearly on the issues they learn, and improve them through their original understanding, instead of forcing them to memorize mechanically. (2) The vast majority of students are of worker-peasant origin. Generally speaking, they have more specific knowledge of production and life, but lack abstract scientific knowledge. Some people have a poor ability to abstract things. Therefore, we must be good at teaching through the things and vocabularies familiar to students and the characteristics of their thinking, from near to far and from concrete to abstract, and appropriately use examples and experiments to help explain problems. (3) They are also revolutionary soldiers. The teaching content and methods must be adapted to this characteristic. The selection of materials and the content of lectures should be combined with the work, life, learning, and thinking of the troops, which will easily achieve the goal of "consistent learning and application," and will be most welcomed by the students. (4) Due to the different work nature and cultural level of the students, even within the same class, their learning requirements and acceptance abilities have a certain degree of difference. In order to achieve the unity of teaching, teaching should be suitable for the majority of students, and the special problems of a few (or individual) students should be solved in extracurricular tutoring or in student mutual assistance. The leadership should strengthen this work in a planned and step-by-step manner.

　　Second, it is necessary to correctly grasp the key points of teaching. Regardless of any subject, a certain key point of teaching should be determined according to the students' learning progress—the needs and the possibility of acceptance—and strictly abide by it in the implementation of teaching. Otherwise, our teaching will be blind and will not conform to the principle requirements of step-by-step, gradual improvement, and steady progress. To correctly grasp the key points of teaching, in addition to conducting correct and scientific investigation and research work, two points must be noted: (1) Be good at transferring the key points in a timely and appropriate manner according to the students' learning progress. Transferring the key points too early or too late will affect the teaching effectiveness. (2) Organically combine the key points of teaching in each period. When implementing a certain key point of teaching in a certain period, the past key points should be appropriately combined. Key-point teaching is not equal to skipping grades.

　　4. The training and improvement of teachers must adopt the principle of attaching equal importance to politics and professional skills. In terms of politics, the political and ideological level and theoretical level of teachers should be improved through daily political life, cadre theory learning, and close combination with political and ideological education in the preparation of Chinese language teaching, which is very necessary for a large number of new teachers. In terms of professional skills, according to past experience, running cultural and educational training classes is a good method. Each such training class can last about one and a half months. At the beginning, a period of ideological education should be conducted, mainly to correct the views and attitudes towards cultural education work, and overcome the erroneous views of emphasizing politics over culture and wanting to be "Marxist-Leninist professors" but not wanting to be cultural teachers. Then, the basic principles of teaching methods and the learning of teaching methods for each subject should be carried out. The learning methods can be adopted by reports, discussions, and typical demonstrations. In addition, it is also necessary to supplement the cultural knowledge of teachers with a certain amount of time based on their level. In addition to running training classes, more attention should be paid to the training and improvement of teachers in the teaching process. Methods such as organizing teachers of the same course to conduct regular research; strengthening and improving the work of the "teaching preparation meeting"; doing a good job of "evaluating teaching" and organizing "demonstration teaching" can be adopted. Experience has proved that these methods are effective.

　　In the past two years, although we have achieved certain results and gained some experience in cultural education, there are also many problems in our work. On the basis of the existing work, further implementing the policy of standardization and accelerated training, vigorously improving the quality of teachers, and improving teaching methods will become the direction of our efforts in the future.

### 华北军大两年来文化教育的几点基本经验

　　华北军大两年来文化教育的几点基本经验
    从去年五月创建文化补习学校开始，我校文化教育已逐渐全面开展，迄今为止，已有八百五十三名在职干部、二千三百名连队学员和二千六百五十一名战士、事务人员先后卷入文化学习。在这些同志中，最少的也认识了二百字，有近二百人已达到高小毕业程度。并训练培养了二百四十六名文化教员；编选了十五种教材；在两年来的工作过程中，积累了下面一些经验：
    一、开展文化教育的关键，首先在于各级领导干部对此工作的正确认识，把它真正当作一件重大的历史政治任务来看待，并在实际工作中予以切实的领导和保证。一般说，我们各级领导干部对文教工作是重视的，这对文化教育的开展，曾起了决定性的作用。但事实又告诉我们，某些党委、支部及部分领导干部中，对文化教育工作还或多或少存留着一种不正确的看法，认为这只是一种辅助性的教育，“学认几个字，会算个账就行啦！”似乎是可有可无，因之在实际工作中未予以应有的关心，个别的甚至抱轻视的态度，使文化教育工作的开展，受相当大的限制。这在文化补习学校的工作上，表现得更多一些。
    二、根据形势发展的需要以及主客观所已具备的条件，我们深感军区提出的方针——当前的文化教育建设，必须采取正规与速成的方针——是正确的。所谓正规，首先是根据教育要求和部队的实际情况，制订出一个通盘的计划，有系统、有步骤、有目的地进行教学，同时应确立一套教学组织与制度和编印统一的教材。所谓速成，就是根据部队的需要与可能，在正规的原则下，适当精简教学内容，以缩短整个教学的时间，达到提早完成小学与中学程度的修业期限。要贯彻这个方针，目前主要必须端正以下两种认识上的偏差：（一）急于求成的思想。这种思想是不了解文化知识是点滴积累与逐步提高的，“急”和“跳”非但不能解决问题，反而会走冤枉路和产生灰心情绪。（二）部分领导者和学员不适当地强调“实用”，以为所学的必须马上能用，否则就认为“不需要”。如过去炮兵大队个别负责同志对炮兵三角主张只学十八次就可解决问题，这是错误的。这是教学上的近视眼，不了解今天在部队中提高文化不仅是学会写信、记日记、开条子、算“豆腐账”（这些当然都应学会），而是需要较全面系统的、但又非“学院式”的提高，为进一步学习军事理论与军事技术打下基础。
    三、在教学方法上必须掌握两个基本环节：
    第一、要善于根据教学对象的特点，采用适当的方式方法，就是说要从客观实际出发，不要靠主观愿望办事。一般说来，我们教学对象的特点，及教学法上应注意的要点，大体上是：（一）学员大部分是成年，具有相当的社会经验和革命斗争经验，有一定的政治水平，较强的理解能力，但是年龄较大，记忆力较差。因此在教学法上必须采取少讲多练的原则，从练中达到熟练和巩固，避免“填鸭式”的教学方法。同时由于学员理解判断力较强，对所学的问题，教员必须讲清可能弄懂的道理，通过其原有认识予以提高，不要勉强他们死背硬记。（二）学员绝大部分为工农成份，一般说他们有较多的生产、生活的具体知识，缺乏概括的科学知识。某些人对事物的抽象能力差。因之要善于通过学员所熟悉的事物、语汇，以及他们的思路特点，由近到远，由具体到抽象去进行教学，并适当的运用例证、实验去帮助说明问题。（三）他们又是革命军人。在教学内容及方法上必须适合这一特点。在选材及讲授内容上要与部队的工作、生活、学习、思想等情况结合起来，这就容易达到“学用一致”的目的，而最为学员所欢迎。（四）由于学员工作性质及文化程度的不同，因此即使在同一班次内，其学习的要求和接受能力也有一定程度的差异。为了达到教学的统一，在教学上应适合学员中的大多数，对少数（或个别）学员的特殊问题应放在课外进行辅导或在学员互助中去解决。领导上要有计划、有步骤地加强这方面的工作。
    第二、要正确地掌握教学重点，不论任何课目均应根据学员学习进步的情况——需要与接受的可能，来确定一定的教学重点，并在教学实施中严格遵守之。否则我们的教学是盲目的，将不符合于按步就班、逐步提高、稳步前进的原则要求。要做到正确的掌握教学重点，除必须正确地科学地进行调查研究工作外，有两点必须注意：（一）要善于根据学员学习进步情况，及时地适当地转移重点。重点转移的过早或过迟，都是会影响教学收效的。（二）把各个时期的教学重点有机的结合起来，在一定时期实施某一教学重点时，应适当地结合过去的重点。重点教学并不等于躐等而进的教学。
    四、培养与提高教员，必须采取政治与业务并重的方针。政治方面应通过日常的政治生活，干部理论学习以及从国文教学准备中紧密地结合政治思想教育，去提高教员的政治思想水平及理论水平，这对大批新教员来说是十分必要的。业务方面，根据过去的经验，开办文教训练班，是一种良好的方法。此种训练班大约每期一个半月时间即可。开始应进行一段思想教育，主要是端正对文化教育工作的看法及态度，克服重政治轻文化，想当“马列主义教授”而不愿当文化教员的错误观点。然后，应进行教学法基本原则与各课教学法的学习。学习方法可采取报告、讨论、典型示范等。此外根据教员的水平，以一定时间，进行文化知识的补充训练，亦有必要。除开办训练班外，更须注意在教学过程中对教员的培养与提高。可采取把同一课程的教员组织起来，进行定期的研究；加强和改进“教学准备会”的工作；作好“评教学”以及组织“示范教学”等方法。经验证明这些方法是有效的。
    两年来，我们在文化教育上虽然获得了一定的成绩，获得了一些经验，然而工作中的毛病也是很多的。在现有的工作基础上，进一步贯彻正规与速成的方针，大力提高教员的质量，改进教学方法，就成为我们今后努力的方向。
