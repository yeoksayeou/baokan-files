　　After the Early Rice Harvest in Ningbo Prefecture
    Farmers Purchase Fertilizer and Add Farm Tools, Urban-Rural Exchange Becomes Active

[Reported by our newspaper from Ningbo] After the early rice harvest in Ningbo Prefecture, Zhejiang, farmers are actively purchasing fertilizers and adding farm tools, leading to a more active exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. This year, the early rice in the prefecture has generally seen a bumper harvest, and farmers are highly motivated to apply fertilizer to late rice to increase production, and they are flocking to cities to buy fertilizer. The Ningbo City Environmental Sanitation Management Office's daily output of 2,800 dan of human waste has been fully ordered and allocated to farmers. The sales of fertilizing powder from the local products company have surged. In early August, they established consignment relationships with five private merchants, including Yongtai Feng, and sold 161,105 jin of fertilizing powder in eight days. Taking the northern part of Yin County as an example, the amount of fertilizer applied to late rice has more than doubled compared to last year. At the Nanmenwai Three Markets in Ningbo City, in the ten days or so since the harvest of "fire rice" (a type of early rice that matures ten days earlier than ordinary early rice), mountain goods merchants have sold about two to three hundred dan of bamboo baskets every day. The sales of other items such as sieves, dustpans, ironware, and harrows have also increased by two or three times compared to before. Bamboo and wood shops and blacksmith shops are working day and night, but there is still a feeling of supply falling short of demand.

　　宁波专区早稻收完后
    农民购肥添农具  城乡交流趋活跃
    【本报宁波讯】浙江宁波专区早稻收割后，农民纷纷购买肥料和添置农具，城乡物资交流趋于活跃。该专区今年早稻普告丰收，农民对晚稻施肥增产情绪极高，纷纷前往城市购买肥料。宁波市环境卫生管理处每日出产的二千八百担人粪尿，已全部订购与配贷给农民；土产公司的肥田粉销路激增，八月初先后与永泰丰等五家私商建立代销关系，并在八天内即销售肥田粉十六万一千零五斤。以鄞县北乡为例，晚稻施肥料超过去年一倍以上。宁波市南门外三市，自火稻（早稻之一种，比一般的早熟十日）收割后十余天中，山货商所出卖的竹箩，每天约二、三百担；其他如筛、畚斗、铁器、刀耙之类，销售量亦较前增加二、三倍。竹、木店、打铁店夜以继日工作，仍有供不应求之感。
