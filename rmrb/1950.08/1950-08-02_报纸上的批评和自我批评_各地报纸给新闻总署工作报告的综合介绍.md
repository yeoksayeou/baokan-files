Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers
Comprehensive Introduction to the Work Report of the General Administration of Press and Publication by Newspapers in Various Regions
News and Publication Administration Research Office

	Unfolding criticism and self-criticism was one of the central issues in the work reports of various newspapers to the General Administration of Press and Publication in May and June.

	*New Hunan Daily* stated that in the “seventeen days of May, there were six critical reports, published on the front page or the second page headline; among the twenty-three editorials, short commentaries, and editor's notes, nine were critical comments on the shortcomings or errors of various tasks; among the ten letters from readers published on the front page, four were criticisms of the work.” The *Heilongjiang Daily* published critical articles in June, “totaling 177, accounting for a little over 19% of the total number of published submissions (referring to submissions from local correspondents, excluding telegrams and literary supplements) of 907.” Private newspapers, which previously published fewer critical articles, also gradually unfolded criticism and achieved better results. *Shanghai Ta Kung Pao* in May, "carefully carried out criticism work considering Shanghai's actual situation, and the feedback was generally good.” *Shanghai News Daily* also made better achievements.

	The unfolding of criticism has helped the government examine its work and correct errors. *New Hunan Daily* stated in its report: "After the strengthening of criticism, it has played a promoting role in the work. For example, after the newspaper published criticism of Nanxian's neglect of spring plowing leadership, the Changde Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Prefectural Party Committee immediately notified the county to check its work, respectively correcting the bureaucratic style in production and disaster relief and the tendency to infringe upon middle peasants.” Such concrete effects were also significant in other regions.

	Due to the vigorous implementation of the Central Committee's decision by the newspapers, the masses' concerns began to dissipate. *Liaoxi Daily* stated: "Judging from the readers' letters, readers' thoughts were still hesitant at the beginning. For example, there were 31 letters of criticism in May (and 7 people came to the newspaper office to appeal), which increased to 123 in June (and 7 people came to the newspaper office to appeal); in May, most letters were written from the perspective of a third party, and the questions raised were not specific. In June, people dared to boldly speak their minds... This shows that the masses are beginning to dare to criticize and supervise the work of the Party and the government... It can also be seen from the farmers' letters that they were inspired by the readers' letters published in the 'Masses' Garden' and wrote them.” *New Hunan Daily* stated: The Central Committee's decision "made a deep impression on the masses. Many readers dared to write letters to the newspaper and criticize the work only after seeing this decision.” *Zhejiang Daily* stated: "As a result of the initial development of criticism, the relationship between the newspaper and the masses has slightly improved. The Social Service Group received 1,668 letters and drafts from May 1st to June 15th, among which the number of criticisms and suggestions increased from 4% to 15.8%. Some masses are beginning to trust the newspaper.” As the masses' concerns began to dissipate and their enthusiasm was initially developed, therefore, as the *Hebei Daily* said, newspapers "began to increase criticism from below. For example, a farmer named Wang Yukun in Wen'an asked an elementary school teacher to write a criticism of the county's granary. Wen'an County immediately conducted an inspection of the granary based on the newspaper's opinion. After proving that the criticism was completely true, the person in charge of the granary made a public self-criticism in the newspaper.”

	Events of adopting an indifferent attitude towards criticism, or even suppressing and retaliating against criticism, have begun to decrease. *Hebei Daily* stated: After the Central Committee's decision was published, "unprecedented progress has been made in the development of criticism and self-criticism, and the incorrect tendency to ignore or retaliate against criticism has been basically eliminated. Generally, after criticism in the newspaper, reviews and handling were carried out in a timely manner, and the newspaper was answered.” After *Dazhong Daily* unfolded criticism and self-criticism, "the Jinan Municipal Party Committee publicly issued a document in the newspaper to support the workers' criticism, which had a good response among the workers. As for those who were criticized, the general indifferent attitude of the past has also changed. Those who did not express their attitude for three to five months after the criticism in the past have also sent letters to express their attitude.” These have created conditions for further unfolding criticism and self-criticism.

	There are reasons for achieving these achievements.

	First, the strong support of the government and Party committees at all levels. After the Central Committee's decision was published, most provinces and cities issued instructions to implement the Central Committee's decision, and most lower-level Party committees were able to pay attention to it. After the *Hebei Daily* published the criticism of the granary by Wang Yukun, a farmer in Wen'an County, "the county Party committee called on all correspondents in the county to learn from the farmer Wang Yukun, and strive to guide the masses to criticize the bureaucracy of the leading organs and cadres and the shortcomings and errors in their work, and demanded that all cadres listen to the criticisms of the masses.” Private newspapers particularly felt the great role of the strong support of Party and government leadership in unfolding criticism and self-criticism. *Ta Kung Pao* stated in its report: "The criticism work for more than a month is a fairly good start, and the importance and advocacy of this work by local Party and government leaders is also a great driving force for this fairly good start.”

	Second, newspapers have also done some publicity and organizational work for unfolding mass criticism and self-criticism. *Shenyang Labor Daily* "focused on Shenyang, convened a representative meeting of correspondents, discussed the difficulties of criticism and self-criticism, how to implement the Central Committee's decision, and how correspondents should grasp and write critical articles... organized correspondents to write articles supporting the Central Committee's decision and reviewing their own thoughts, as a ideological brewing, and prominently published critical articles by worker correspondents.” Such publicity and organizational work played a certain role in promoting the enthusiasm of workers and farmers.

	At the same time, necessary struggles against the bad tendencies of resisting and suppressing criticism are of great help in promoting the work. After *Southern Jiangsu Daily* criticized the Zhou Fugeng incident of suppressing criticism (Editor's Note: The newspaper review in the twelfth issue of this journal had an introduction), "on the one hand, this incident was reasonably resolved, promoting the improvement of the factory's trade union; on the other hand, it improved the readers' understanding of criticism and self-criticism and encouraged the masses' confidence and courage to carry out criticism. Afterwards, some workers dared to write critical articles and called the editors and reporters to ask them to help them write. And it is also a good education for ourselves, indicating that we should not take a liberal attitude towards the suppression of criticism, but should carry out serious struggles.”

	Due to these reasons, the effort to "attract the people to publicly criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work in newspapers and periodicals" has begun to receive attention from all parties, and newspaper staff have also initially gained some experience in the process of unfolding criticism.

	One of the main experiences is that the newspaper editorial department must carefully handle critical articles to "distinguish between correct criticism and wrong criticism.” *Shenyang Daily* stated in its report that they have received some results in criticism, "This is mainly because we have grasped the true situation and avoided as much as possible that the criticized person can refuse criticism on the pretext of 'discrepancies' or 'inconsistencies.' At the same time, we do not criticize his fragmented and trivial matters, which are irrelevant, but try to grasp the key issues in the central work. This is built on the familiar understanding of the work of the relevant departments by the responsible comrades of the newspaper, the study of the central work, and the understanding of the Party's policies.” *Heilongjiang Daily* has gained this understanding in this regard: Handling critical articles "must be treated with an extremely serious attitude, and decisions cannot be made rashly based on temporary emotions or subjective desires. First of all, analyze and judge the authenticity of the manuscript, and secondly judge whether the criticism is constructive, and then analyze the content of the criticism, those parts are mixed with personal intentions, those parts belong to one-sided local views, those criticisms are not appropriately measured, and those key points are ambiguous, and delete, modify or add editor's notes responsibly according to the situation. If we cannot judge the authenticity of the manuscript, we should consult the relevant parties and listen to the opinions of the relevant authorities until we basically understand it.” This is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the criticism.

	Naturally, the so-called careful handling does not mean accumulating and delaying, or being restricted. *Heilongjiang Daily* stated: "In the past for a long period of time, …emphasizing 'caution,' emphasizing 'results' (that is, replies or reviews from relevant authorities or parties involved) at the same time as publishing criticism, which not only doomed our critical articles to not be published in a timely manner, but also, experience has proved that many of the critical articles processed in this way have disappeared without a trace, without any response… The relevant authorities or parties involved do not care about the readers' criticisms that we 'passed up from below,' but only regard the newspaper as a receiving and dispatching office for mass opinions, and the readers also think that their opinions are being transferred to the relevant authorities through the 'organ' of the newspaper, rather than directly criticizing them publicly in the newspaper.” This is obviously wrong, and we should pay attention to "after judging that the submission is basically correct, and has the value of publication, it can be published immediately" under careful conditions. And this is inseparable from the spirit of independent responsibility of the newspaper. The editorial department of *Hebei Daily* "after the announcement of the Central Committee's decision, the handling of reports on criticism and self-criticism was more bold, and it was clarified that it should be independently responsible.” *Heilongjiang Daily*'s understanding of this point is: "The so-called independent responsibility, in addition to referring to not having a dependent mentality on the relevant authorities (often the superior authorities of the criticized), especially when the relevant authorities disagree with the publication of this criticism in the newspaper for this or that reason, after fully considering the opinions of the relevant authorities, and believing that there is no problem with the authenticity of the manuscript, the starting point of the criticism is good, and the manuscript itself has a certain political and educational significance, and publishing it is beneficial to the work, it should still be responsible for publishing it, and should not compromise with the negative and incorrect attitude of the relevant authorities who are unwilling to publish it publicly in the newspaper and are willing to 'settle it privately.'” *Heilongjiang Daily* did this, and played a good role in criticizing the incident of reversing the construction of the dike in the Tao'er River Zhenlai section, making the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, which had originally disagreed with the publication, think it was beneficial, and instructed its subordinate units to "study" the relevant materials in the newspaper.

	*Heilongjiang Daily* also gained the experience of "from small to large" and "from shallow to deep." They said in their report: "The so-called from small to large refers to making a 'surface expansion' of criticism with universal educational significance, expanding the impact of criticism in the scope of the involved, which is the so-called 'one leads to a series.' The problems exposed by the masses generally start from smaller problems. As long as we seriously and timely publish them, we can gradually inspire the masses to further expose more serious problems in the work. In the actual law, the exposure of serious work problems is often achieved by exposing a part and then reaching the exposure of the whole. For example, we published readers' letters criticizing several county hospitals, and at the same time published comments calling on all public hospitals to unfold criticism and self-criticism, and wrote to the Provincial Health Department, asking them to express their opinions on this matter and take measures. Later, we received a series of readers' letters criticizing other hospitals and hospital reviews, and the Provincial People's Government also issued instructions to 'establish a new style of medical workers,' ordering all hospitals to conduct a general inspection of their work, which expanded the impact of criticism in the scope involved. This mainly relies on organizational work. The so-called from shallow to deep means to raise the 'right and wrong' of criticism to the policy and principle level to understand, and directly explore the essence of the problem. This mainly relies on the commentary work in the newspaper. Specifically, that is, after the criticism is published, on the one hand, it is necessary to help the criticized person conduct a deep review, and on the other hand, it should strive for the Party and government leading organs to make a decision on the handling of the event, issue instructions, and conduct a general inspection of the work, check the thoughts, and conduct study based on the lessons of the 'event'; then the newspaper should publish comments and make a summary. Only in this way can we achieve 'from individual comments to more profound criticism, to summarizing the results of criticism, and showing what achievements we have gained in construction as a result of criticism.' (Stalin: *Against Vulgarizing the Slogan of Self-Criticism*)"

	The above achievements and experiences should be affirmed, which shows that since the Central Committee's decision was published, criticism and self-criticism in newspapers has been initially unfolded in two or three months, which is a valuable gain. But it cannot be said that unfolding criticism and self-criticism in newspapers has completely embarked on a smooth road. On the contrary, there are still problems and difficulties in front of us. The following three aspects of the problems can be seen from the work reports of various newspapers.

	One of the important problems is that although the phenomenon of suppressing criticism or delaying and ignoring criticism has begun to decrease, it still exists in large numbers. This is an obstacle that needs to be cleared vigorously. According to the statistics of *Northern Jiangsu Daily*, they "published 13 critical articles in the reader service column in May, only 8 of which had replies; among the 34 letters of criticism transferred to the relevant authorities for investigation and reply, only 2 had replies and reviews.” *New Hunan Daily* reflected in its report that many at all levels and in all departments "generally established strict review systems. Critical articles are often detained after being reviewed. Some manuscripts written below the county are reviewed once by the district, and then reviewed again by the county. This situation exists universally in various counties, that is, there is not a single article criticizing the district leaders that has been reviewed by the district, and there is no article criticizing the county leaders that has been reviewed by the county. Only occasionally found a few articles criticizing district leaders that have not been reviewed by the district. During the rent reduction in the three districts of Liuyang, the cadres once put twenty-four landlords on the stage kneeling, and said to the masses: 'You can deal with it as you want.' A comrade wrote a critical article because of this. After this article was sent to the county, the county party committee issued a notice based on this material, but suppressed the manuscript and did not send it to the newspaper. It can be seen that although the review system has certain advantages, it is a major obstacle to the development of criticism and self-criticism.” Individual cadres or departments even have "very strong resistance emotions.” This situation requires us, on the one hand, to continue to carry out propaganda and education on criticism and self-criticism, and on the other hand, the newspaper editorial department needs to pay more attention and formulate some systems to ensure the implementation of criticism. *Southern Jiangsu Daily* reviewed in its report: "…We ourselves still have an irresponsible liberal attitude towards criticism and self-criticism. We do not care about the effect of criticism. In most cases, after publishing the news and letters of criticism, it seems to be over. We do not inquire, and we do not organize reports on the results of the criticism. Therefore, in addition to making everyone realize this problem, we also stipulate that the comrades in the editorial department must immediately inquire about all the critical letters or news published in the newspaper, and even use on-the-spot investigation and other methods to achieve results and effects. The general editor's office should conduct timely inspections on this. For the important critical events published before, if there is no reply, we will clean up, continue to inquire, and obtain a reply.” *Liaoxi Daily* and others also stipulated and implemented a follow-up system for critical events.

	Another equally important problem is that, since criticism and self-criticism are only initially unfolded, the understanding among newspaper editorial staff is not yet fully clear, so there are some wrong ideas and attitudes. *Southern Jiangsu Daily*, "After the initial development of criticism and self-criticism, it has been found that individual reporters have a wrong idea of 'authority' and 'fighting for injustice.' When interviewing, they do not have a humble, cautious, kind, and responsible attitude, but are angry, fighting for injustice, and arbitrarily drawing conclusions for others.” *New Hunan Daily* found that "individual reporters are arrogant and conceited due to the influence of individual heroism, and give people the impression of being 'imperial envoys flying all over the sky' and 'coming down to check the work' in interviews and writing, causing dissatisfaction from the other party. Some agencies have formally written letters to criticize this style.” *Gansu Daily* also said: "On the issue of criticism, the editorial staff have revealed a mood of being happy to expose, and it is necessary to step up education to prevent simple exposure, not proceeding from unity and improving the work, and circling in fragmented trivial matters.” This wrong ideological style should be corrected immediately.

	In addition, some editors have found a tendency to be careless and exaggerate facts in handling manuscripts. For example, *Shenyang Labor Daily* checked out "In one manuscript, the worker correspondent originally only said that the rubber shoes were cracked and suggested that the shoe factory pay attention to improvement, but we added two sentences: 'They are broken in two weeks, and no one wants to wear them.'” Another example is that *Zhejiang Daily* checked out "Some letters uncritically published wrong opinions such as 'more than 90% of village cadres in a certain county are corrupt,' which is a blow to the creativity and enthusiasm of the vast lower-level cadres.” Phenomena of a similar nature are, as *Liaoxi Daily* said: "When adding 'editor's opinions,' they lack the ability to analyze problems, often repeat the words in the reader's letter, or the tone of ordering punishment is too heavy, such as 'serious mistakes' and 'must be punished,' which may also promote the style of punishment below.” These phenomena should be noted.

	Finally, another important issue is that although newspapers have begun to have bottom-up criticism, generally speaking, the proportion is still very insufficient. As *Southern Jiangsu Daily* said: "At present, in the criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, there are very few real bottom-up criticisms, especially those written by the working people themselves… Without extensive bottom-up criticism from the masses, especially from workers and farmers, it will be impossible to adhere to and further develop criticism and self-criticism.” The situation in some places is like *Southern Jiangsu Daily*, "There are slightly more letters from farmers and grassroots farmers association cadres than workers, but the proportion is also very small.” In some places, such as *Jinan Dazhong Daily*, it is felt that "farmers' acceptance of criticism and self-criticism is far less than that of workers. They are also scattered and inconvenient to accept education in this regard. It is very important for the leading organs to enlighten them more, because this is not done enough, so the criticism of farmers reflected in the newspapers is still very small and weak.” No matter what the situation is, the general characteristic is that it has not yet been possible to widely attract workers and peasants to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, making them a huge political force to supervise the work of the government and the Party. And this is closely related to the development of the worker-peasant correspondent movement, and newspapers should make greater efforts to develop their worker-peasant correspondents.

　　报纸上的批评和自我批评
    各地报纸给新闻总署工作报告的综合介绍
    新闻总署研究室
    展开批评和自我批评是五、六月份各报给新闻总署工作报告的中心问题之一。
    新湖南报说，在五月份的“十七天当中，有六次带有批评性的报道，是在一版或二版头条的地位刊出的；二十三篇社论、短评与编者的话当中，有九篇是针对各项工作的缺点或错误所作的带批评性的评论；在一版所刊载的十件读者来信当中，有四件是对工作的批评。”黑龙江日报六月份发表的批评性稿件“计一七七篇，占来稿发表总数（指各地通讯员来稿，电讯稿及文艺专刊除外）九○七篇之百分之十九强。”过去较少刊载批评性稿件的私营报纸，也逐步展开批评，并有了较好的成绩，上海大公报五月份“在考虑上海实际情况下，谨慎地进行批评的工作，反映大体是良好的。”上海新闻日报也有了较好的成绩。
    批评展开了，这就帮助了政府检查工作和纠正错误。新湖南报在报告中说：“批评加强以后，对工作已起了推动作用。例如报纸发表南县忽视春耕领导的批评后，常德专署和地委立即通知该县检查工作，分别纠正了生产救灾中的官僚主义作风和侵犯中农的偏向。”这样的具体效果在其他地区也有显著的表现。
    由于报纸大力贯彻了中央的决定，群众的顾虑开始打消了。辽西日报说：“从读者来信看，开始时读者思想还有顾虑，如五月来批评信三十一件（另有七人来报社申诉），六月增至一二三件（另有七人来报社申诉）；五月来信多系以第三者自居，提的问题也不具体，六月就敢大胆出面说真心话了。……说明群众开始敢于批评监督党和政府的工作了。……从农民来信也可以看出，他们是看了‘群众园地’登的读者来信受到启发以后写来的。”新湖南报说：中央的决定“对群众印象很深，许多读者都是看到这个决定以后，才大胆给报纸写信，对工作提出批评。”浙江日报说：“由于初步开展批评的结果，报纸与群众的关系稍有改善，社会服务组五月一日至六月十五日收到信稿一六六八件，其中有关批评建议的从百分之四增至百分之十五·八。某些群众开始信赖报纸。”由于群众的顾虑开始打消，积极性初步发扬起来了，因此，如河北日报所说，报纸上“开始增加了自下而上的批评。如文安一个农民叫王玉琨的，请小学教师代笔批评该县粮库，文安县立即根据报纸的意见，帮助该粮库进行检查，证明批评完全属实后，该库负责人即在报纸上公开检讨。”
    对批评采取置之不理甚至压制报复等不正确态度的事件，已开始减少。河北日报说：中央的决定发表了之后，在“批评和自我批评的开展上已获得空前的进步，基本上已消灭了对批评置之不理或打击报复的不正确的倾向。一般地在报纸批评之后，均及时进行了检讨处理，回答报纸。”大众日报展开批评和自我批评后，“济南市委曾公开在报纸上发出支持工人批评的文件，在工人群众中有较好的反响。至于被批评者，过去一般的不理睬态度也有转变，过去批评后三五个月没有表示态度的，也纷纷来函表示态度。”这些又为进一步展开批评和自我批评创造了条件。
    取得了这样一些成绩是有原因的。
    首先，是政府和中共各级党委的大力支持。中央决定发表之后，各省市大多发表了贯彻中央决定的指示，下级党委也多数能加以注意，河北日报在发表了文安县农民王玉琨对粮库的批评之后，“该县县委号召全县通讯员向农民王玉琨学习，努力引导群众批评领导机关和干部的官僚主义及工作中的缺点和错误，并要求全县干部倾听群众的批评。”私营报纸在展开批评和自我批评中特别感到了党政领导上的大力支持的巨大作用，大公报在报告中说：“一个多月的批评工作是一个相当良好的开始，而地方党政领袖对这一工作的重视与倡导，也是促成这一相当良好开始的极大动力。”
    其次，报纸对于展开群众性的批评和自我批评，也做了一些宣传工作和组织工作。沈阳劳动日报“以沈阳为重点，召开通讯员代表会议，讨论了批评和自我批评的困难，如何贯彻中央决定，通讯员应如何掌握与写批评稿件，……组织了通讯员写拥护中央决定、联系自己思想检讨的稿件，作为思想酝酿，并突出地刊载了工人通讯员的批评稿件。”这样的宣传和组织工作，对发扬工农通讯员的积极性起了一定的作用。
    同时，与抗拒和压制批评的恶劣倾向作必要的斗争，对推动工作是有很大的作用的。苏南日报在批评了周福赓压制批评事件（编者按：本刊第十二期报纸述评曾有介绍。）之后，“一方面是合理地解决了这一事件，推动了该厂工会的改进，另一方面提高了读者对于批评和自我批评的认识，鼓舞了群众开展批评的信心和勇气。事后有些工人敢写批评稿件，来电话要求编辑记者去帮助他们写。而对于我们自己也是一个良好的教育，说明不应该对压制批评采取自由主义，而应该进行严肃的斗争。”
    由于这些原因，“吸引人民群众在报纸刊物上公开批评我们工作中的缺点和错误”的努力已开始受到各方面的重视，而报纸工作人员在展开批评的过程中，也初步取得了一些经验。
    主要的经验之一是报纸编辑部必须慎重处理批评稿件，以“区别正确的批评和错误的批评”。沈阳日报在报告中说，他们在批评上已收到了一些效果，“这主要是由于掌握了真实情况，尽可能避免了被批评者借口‘有出入’，‘不符合’而拒绝批评。同时，我们不是批评他的零碎末节，不关痛痒的事，而是尽量抓住中心工作中的关键问题。这是建筑在报社负责同志对该部门工作的熟悉了解，对中心工作的钻研，对党的政策的体会上的。”黑龙江日报在这方面有了这样的认识：处理批评稿件“一定要以极严肃的态度来对待，不能凭一时的意气或主观的愿望，轻率的决定取舍。首先要分析和判断稿件的真实性，其次要判断批评是不是建设性的，再次要分析批评的内容，那些部分是夹杂私人意气的，那些部分是属于片面局部观点的，那些批评是分寸不恰当的，那些关键是含糊不清的，根据情况负责予以删除、修改或加按语。如果我们不能判断稿件真伪的话，应当向有关方面查询，听取有关机关意见，直到基本上弄清楚为止。”为了保证批评的真确性，这样做是必要的。
    自然，所谓要慎重处理，决不是积压拖延，或者束手束脚的意思。黑龙江日报说：“在过去很长一个时期，……强调‘慎重’，强调发表批评的同时要‘有结果’（即有有关机关或当事人的答复或检讨），这不但注定了我们的批评稿件不能及时发表，而且，经验证明：经过这样处理的批评稿件，很多是石沉大海，没有回音。……有关机关或当事人对于我们‘从下面递过去的’读者批评，并不在意，只把报纸看作是群众意见的收发处，而读者群众也认为是把他们的意见经过报社这个‘机关’再转送有关机关，而不是直接在报纸上公开批评。”这样显然是不对的，应该在慎重的条件下同时注意“在能判断来稿基本上是正确的以后，有发表的价值，就可以立即发表。”而这又是与报纸的独立负责精神分不开的。河北日报编辑部在“中央决定公布后，对批评和自我批评报道的处理较为大胆了，明确了应该独立负责。”黑龙江日报对这一点的体会是：“所谓独立负责，除了指对有关机关（常常是被批评者的上级机关）不要存在依赖心理以外，特别是当有关机关以这个或那个理由不同意这篇批评在报上发表的时候，我们在充分考虑了有关机关的意见以后，认为稿件的真实性没有问题，批评的出发点是善意的，稿件本身具有一定的政治教育意义，发表出来对于工作有好处，就仍应当负责予以发表，不能和有关机关那种不愿在报纸上公开发表而愿意‘私下了事’的消极的不正确的态度相妥协。”黑龙江日报这样做了，并且在批评洮儿河镇赉段修堤反工的事件中，起了好的作用，使原来曾不同意发表的省水利局认为有好处，并将报纸上的有关材料“指示所属进行学习”。
    黑龙江日报并取得了“由小到大”，“由浅入深”的经验。他们在报告中说：“所谓由小到大，是指的把带有普遍教育意义的批评，做‘面的扩展’，在牵连的范围上，扩大批评的影响，也就是所谓‘一牵连一串子’。群众揭发的问题，一般地都是由较小的问题上开始，只要我们认真地及时地发表，就能逐渐启发群众进一步揭发更严重的工作中的毛病。在实际的规律中，严重的工作毛病的揭发，也往往是由揭发一部分进而达到揭发全部。比如我们发表了读者批评几个县立医院的来信，就同时发表评论号召各公立医院展开批评和自我批评，并给省卫生处去信，请他们对这事发表意见，采取办法。后来就接到了一连串的读者批评其他医院的来信和医院的检讨，省人民政府也发出了‘树立医务工作者新作风’的指示，令各医院普遍检查工作，这就在涉及范围上扩大了批评的影响。这主要靠组织工作。所谓由浅入深，是说要把批评的‘是非’提到政策原则上来认识，直探问题的本质。这主要靠报纸上的评论工作。具体的说，即当批评发表以后，一方面要帮助被批评者进行深刻的检讨，一方面又应当争取党政领导机关对事件作出处理的决定，发出指示，根据‘事件’的教训普遍检查工作，检查思想，进行学习；再由报社发表言论，作出总结。只有这样，才能做到‘从个别的评述，进到比较深刻的批评，进到概括批评的结果，表明由于批评的结果，我们在建设方面获得了什么样的成绩。’（斯大林：《反对把自我批评的口号庸俗化》）”
    以上这些成绩和经验都是应该加以肯定的，这说明自从中央决定发表之后，两三个月中报纸上的批评和自我批评已经初步展开了，这是可贵的收获。但是还不能说在报纸上展开批评和自我批评已经完全走上坦途了，正相反，在我们面前还是有问题和困难的。从各地报纸的工作报告中可以看出以下三方面的问题。
    重要的问题之一是虽然压制批评或对批评拖延不理的现象已经开始减少了，但是仍旧大量存在着。这是尚待大力清除的障碍。据苏北日报统计，他们在“五月份读者服务栏刊登批评稿件十三篇，有答复的仅有八篇；转有关机关调查答复的批评信，三十四封中仅有二封有答复和检讨。”新湖南报在报告中反映，各级、各部门有许多“都普遍建立严格的审稿制度，对于批评稿件，往往一经过审查就被扣留了。有些县下面写的稿件，由区里审查一次以后，送到县里再审查一次。各县普遍存在这样的情形，就是经过区审查的稿件，连一篇批评区领导的也没有，由县审查过的，也就没有批评县领导的稿件。不经过区审查的，则间或发现少数批评区领导的稿件。浏阳三区在减租时，干部有一次把二十四个地主放在台上跪着，对群众说：‘你们要怎样处理就怎样处理’，有一个同志因此写了一篇批评稿件，此稿寄到县以后，县委虽然根据这个材料发了通报，但把稿子却压下来了，不给报社寄来。可见审稿制度虽然有其一定的优点，但是对展开批评与自我批评却是一大阻碍。”个别的干部或部门，甚至有“很重的抵抗情绪”。这种情形就需要我们一方面继续进行关于批评和自我批评的宣传教育，另一方面也需要报纸编辑部加强注意，订立一些制度以保证批评的贯彻。苏南日报在报告中检讨说：“……我们自己对于批评和自我批评仍存在着不负责任的自由主义态度，不去关心批评的效果，大多数的情况是：把批评的新闻和信件发表以后，就好像结束了似的，不去查询，不去组织有关批评的结果的报道。因此，我们除了要大家认识这一问题以外，还规定了凡是报纸上已发表的批评信件或新闻，编辑部的同志必须立即去查询，以至采用实地调查及其他办法，达到有结果，有效果。总编办公室应按时对此进行检查。对于以前所发表的重要批评事件，如无答复的即进行清理，继续追询，取得答复。”辽西日报等也都规定和实行了对批评事件的追查制度。
    同样重要的另一个问题是，由于批评和自我批评还只是初步展开，报纸编辑部工作人员中认识还没有完全明确，因此存在着一些错误的思想和态度。苏南日报“在批评和自我批评初步展开之后，已发现有个别记者存在着一种‘权威’与‘打抱不平’的错误思想，采访时不是谦逊谨慎，与人为善，认真负责的态度，而是气愤、抱不平，随便替人下结论。”新湖南报发现“个别记者由于个人英雄主义的思想作祟，骄傲自大，自以为是，在采访与写作中，给人家的印象是‘钦差大臣满天飞’，‘下来检查工作’，引起对方不满，有的机关已正式来信，对此种作风提出批评。”甘肃日报也说：“在批评问题上，编采人员中已露出以揭露为快事的情绪，须加紧教育，防止单纯揭露，不从团结与改进工作出发，以及在零碎琐事上打圈子等偏向。”这种错误的思想作风是应该立即加以纠正的。
    另外，有的编辑人员在处理稿件中发现了粗枝大叶，夸大事实的偏向，例如沈阳劳动日报检查出“有一个稿件，工人通讯员原稿只是说胶鞋裂了口，提请鞋厂注意改进，我们却加上两句‘两个礼拜就坏了，谁也不爱穿。’”又如浙江日报检查出“个别信件中无批判地发表‘某县百分之九十以上村干部贪污’等错误意见，对广大下层干部的创造性与积极性是一个打击。”类似性质的现象是如辽西日报所说：“在加‘编报人意见’的时候，缺乏分析问题的能力，往往重复读者来信中的话，或者命令惩办口气太重，如‘严重错误’，‘必须惩办’等，这也可能助长下面的惩办作风。”这些现象都是应当注意的。
    最后，还有一个重要的问题是虽然报纸开始有了自下而上的批评，但一般地说，在比重上依然很不够。如苏南日报所说：“目前报纸上的批评和自我批评，真正的自下而上的，特别是来自劳动人民自己所写的批评为数极少。……如果没有广泛的自下而上，来自群众，特别是来自工人农民的批评，要坚持和进一步展开批评和自我批评将是不可能的。”有的地方的情形如苏南日报，“农民及基层农会干部来信比工人稍为多些，但所占比例也很少。”有的地方如济南大众日报，则感觉到“农民对批评和自我批评的接受力远不及工人，他们又分散，不便于接受这方面的教育，领导机关对他们多作启发就非常重要，因为这方面做的还不够，所以报纸上反映农民的批评还显得十分少而无力。”无论是那一种情形，总的特点是还没有做到广泛地吸引工农群众在报纸上运用批评和自我批评的武器，使他们成为监督政府和党的工作的巨大的政治力量。而这和工农通讯员运动的展开是密切联系着的，报纸应当用更大的努力来发展他们的工农通讯员。
