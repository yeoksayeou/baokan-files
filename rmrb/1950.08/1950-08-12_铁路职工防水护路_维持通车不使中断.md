Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Railway workers in various locations are working day and night to prevent floods and protect railway lines. Although some sections of the Beijing-Shanhaiguan (Jingshan) Railway in Anci County, under the jurisdiction of Luofa Station, and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway near Bengbu were flooded, traffic was maintained throughout, preventing any interruption. Sections of the Beijing-Hankou Railway near Gaoyi and the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway near Pingding County, which were damaged by floods, have been repaired and reopened to traffic. Currently, only the section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway near the Puyang River is still under repair.

During the recent surge of the Yongding River, Luofa Station in Anci County on the Jingshan Railway was submerged in a vast expanse of water. However, due to thorough preparations and mobilization, over 2,000 railway workers from various departments immediately engaged in rescue efforts after the flood. Many people risked their lives in the swift currents to drive wooden stakes, enabling trains to slowly pass through water more than half a foot deep over the tracks, ensuring that traffic between Northeast China and the interior remained uninterrupted. Currently, the workers are continuing to closely protect this section of the line, as the period of flood risk has not yet passed.

Note: The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government issued an order in May of this year regarding the prevention of flood damage during the rainy season and the assurance of safe train operations. Subsequently, railway bureaus in various locations established various organizations for flood prevention and railway protection, strengthened contact with water conservancy departments and local governments, and actively carried out preparations for flood prevention projects and the storage of various materials, enabling the rapid repair of lines affected by floods.

　　铁路职工防水护路  维持通车不使中断
    【新华社十一日讯】各地铁路职工正日夜紧张地进行防水和抢护线路的工作。京山（北京至山海关）线安次县属落垡车站和津浦路蚌埠所属线路虽曾有部分线路被水淹没，但始终维持通车，使交通未曾中断。京汉线高邑、石太线平定等县所属被洪水冲毁的部分线路，已先后修复通车。现仅浙赣路临近浦阳江段线路仍在抢修中。
    此次京山线安次县属落垡车站曾因这次永定河水势猛涨，被淹成一片汪洋。但因事前准备和动员工作做得好，水害发生后，立即有各部门铁路职工二千余人投入抢救工作，许多人冒了生命危险在急流中按打木桩，使该线列车在漫过轨面半尺多深的水中徐行通车，保证了东北与关内的交通未曾受阻。现该线职工正继续严密防护这一水害危险期尚未过去的线路。
    按：中央人民政府铁道部在今年五月即发出关于防止雨季水害保证行车安全的命令，此后，各地铁路局即成立了各种防水护路的机构，加强与水利部门及地方政府间的联系，并积极进行了防止水害工程及储备各种材料的准备工作，使发生水害的线路能够迅速被修复。
