　　Comments on China's Land Reform
    China's Land Reform's Impact on All Asian Countries Will Be No Less Than the Military Defeat of the Kuomintang Reactionaries.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 8th] The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Europe, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy" weekly, published an editorial in its August 4th issue (total issue No. 91) commenting on China's land reform. The editorial stated: The Land Reform Law drafted and proposed by the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, a leader tested over a long period of time, is one of the most outstanding documents of our time. The Land Reform Law and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on land reform are built on the solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and a concrete analysis of the Chinese situation. The many fundamental changes that come with China's land reform cannot be underestimated.
    The editorial stated: China's land reform will have an impact on all Asian countries that is no less than the military defeat of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The people of the East, including the great people of India, will see from China's experience a real way to get rid of feudal shackles and imperialist enslavement; they will be even more inspired to carry out a decisive struggle against their oppressors.
    The editorial continued: The Chinese Communist Party has become the leading force in the country. It has more than five million members. Now, the Chinese Communist Party is facing new and complex tasks of national construction. These tasks can only be successfully completed if all party cadres rely on the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism in their work, and only if they have a deeper grasp of Marxist-Leninist science.
    The editorial stated: Imperialists, especially American imperialists, are violently attacking the new social reforms that have begun in China. This emphatically illustrates the unique significance of these reforms. The imperialists are furious at the victory of the Chinese people's strength. They are panicking because of the flames of the Eastern national liberation struggle, and because of the revolutionary influence of China's land reform spreading throughout the East. They want a weak, enslaved, and feudal China. This is why Truman is sparing no effort to aid Chiang Kai-shek, why American agents are carrying out violent activities in China, organizing bandits and saboteurs, continuing to feed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and supply them with weapons. This is why Truman is hastily launching wars in Southeast Asia, organizing intervention in Korea and Taiwan, and doing everything possible to prevent New China from obtaining its rightful place in the United Nations organization.
    The editorial concluded: The people's China has shown its firm and unyielding determination to defend freedom and independence, and it will surely end any adventure by American imperialism.

　　评我国土地改革
    中国的土地改革对亚洲一切国家的影响，  将不下于在军事上击溃国民党反动派。
    【新华社布拉格八日电】欧洲共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主”周刊在八月四日出版的一期（总第九十一期）中发表社论，评论我国的土地改革。社论说：久经考验的领袖毛泽东同志领导的中国共产党所草拟和提出的土地改革法，是现今的杰出的文件之一。土地改革法和刘少奇同志关于土地改革的报告，是建筑在马克思列宁主义的坚固基础，及对于中国情况的具体分析之上的。随着中国的土地改革而来的许多基本变化，是不能低估的。
    社论说：中国的土地改革对亚洲一切国家的影响，将不下于在军事上击溃国民党反动派，以及中华人民共和国的成立那样的大事。东方各族人民，包括伟大的印度人民在内，将从中国的经验中看到摆脱封建桎梏与帝国主义奴役的真实的出路；他们将得到更大的鼓舞，来对他们的压迫者进行决定性的斗争。
    社论继称：中国共产党已成为全国领导的力量。它有五百万以上的党员。现在，中国共产党面临着新的复杂的国家建设的任务。只有全党干部在他们的工作中依靠马列主义的学说，只有他们更深刻地掌握马列主义科学，这些任务才能胜利完成。
    社论说：帝国主义者，特别是美国帝国主义者正在狂暴地攻击在中国开始实行的新的社会改革。这就强调地说明了这些改革所特有的意义。帝国主义者因为中国人民力量的胜利而狂怒。他们因为东方民族解放斗争的火焰，因为中国的土地改革在整个东方散布的革命影响而恐慌。他们想要有一个软弱的、被奴役的和封建的中国。杜鲁门所以不遗余力地援助蒋介石，美国特务所以在中国进行狂暴的活动，组织土匪与破坏分子，继续饲养蒋介石匪帮并供给他们武器，其原因就在于此。杜鲁门所以慌忙地在东南亚发动战争，所以组织对朝鲜与台湾的干涉，并千方百计地阻止新中国在联合国组织中取得其应得的地位，其原因也在于此。
    社论结语称：人民的中国已表明其坚定不屈地保卫自由和独立的决心，它必将终结美国帝国主义的任何冒险。
