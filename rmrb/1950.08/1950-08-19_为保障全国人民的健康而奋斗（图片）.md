Striving to Safeguard the Health of the People Nationwide
　　Commander-in-Chief Zhu visited the National Health and Pharmaceutical Exhibition to inspect the exhibits.
　　The first National Health Conference opened in the capital on the 7th of this month. Vice Premier Guo Moruo gave a report at the meeting.
　　Chairman Mao loves the wounded soldiers. (Large Oil Painting)
　　The first regular Central Hospital was established in Yan'an in 1939 under difficult conditions. The hospital was destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in 1947. The picture shows a model of the Yan'an Central Hospital.
　　A model of ground medical service operations of field troops under enemy fire. The upper right corner shows Comrade Li Landing, a combat area medical hero from East China, who is attending the conference.
　　International friend Dr. Bethune was from Toronto, Canada, an excellent Communist Party member. In 1937, when the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, he was sent to China by the Communist Parties of Canada and the United States to serve. He arrived in Yan'an in April 1938 and reached the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region behind enemy lines on June 17. He devoted himself to supporting the Chinese people's liberation cause and unfortunately died at 5:20 a.m. on November 12, 1939. Chairman Mao told us: "What kind of spirit is it that a foreigner, without any selfish motives, regards the Chinese people's liberation cause as his own? This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every Chinese Communist Party member must learn from this spirit." (Learning from Bethune)
　　In 1941, the Japanese invaders carried out a brutal "Great Mopping-up Operation" in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, massacring the Chinese people. At that time, underground hospitals were established to provide battlefield medical care for the wounded. The picture shows a cross-sectional model of an underground hospital in the Pingjin-Baoding triangle area.
　　SK-type disinfection device. After the train enters the disinfection chamber, the vacuum in the chamber is brought to 710 mm and the temperature reaches 35 to 40 degrees Celsius. After four and a half to five hours, all bedbugs, fleas, and mosquitoes inside the car can be killed. Such facilities already exist in Northeast China.
　　The picture shows a model of a Soviet county hospital, which is very well-equipped.
　　The Ishii bacterial bomb, left behind by the Japanese Unit 731 bacterial factory in Northeast China, is a special ceramic bomb invented by the bacterial war criminal Ishii. It can be filled with plague-infected fleas and dropped from airplanes to spread plague. This is the towering crime of the Japanese invaders in China.
　　Mobile X-ray tuberculosis prevention vehicles are a powerful tool for tuberculosis prevention. The vehicle can be driven to various government agencies and organizations, connected to electricity, and X-rays can be taken, examining 600 people per day.
　　Model of a standard factory hygiene engineering design.
