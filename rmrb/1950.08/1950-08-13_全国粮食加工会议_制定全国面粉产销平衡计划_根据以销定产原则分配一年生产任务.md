Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The National Grain Processing Conference has formulated a national flour production and sales balance plan for the coming year (June 1950 to May 1951) based on the principle of production determined by sales.

According to the conference's report, the national flour production in the previous year (June of last year to May of this year) was over 53 million bags, accounting for only 41.9% of the national production capacity, but even after sales, more than 5 million bags remained. In order to avoid losses caused by blind production and blind sales, the conference decided, based on the slight increase in purchasing power this year, that the nation, excluding the Northeast, will produce a total of 54.1 million bags of flour this year, of which the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation will entrust the processing of 21.4 million bags. The output of each region will be allocated according to the sales volume of each region as follows: East China - over 25.5 million bags; North China - 17 million bags; Central South - over 5.31 million bags; Southwest - 980,000 bags; Northwest - 5.3 million bags. Because flour mills in North China have a higher operating rate, after consultation among the representatives of various regions, it was decided that North China would concede the sales volume of 4.74 million bags to accommodate sales from other regions, in order to take care of regions with lower operating rates. The China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation will also give more consideration to East China, which has a lower operating rate, in the processing of grain.

The conference decided that local trade and industry departments should lead and organize relevant units to participate in flour production and sales consultation committees, and, based on the principle of "giving consideration to both public and private interests," negotiate and allocate production and sales figures within each region, and assist factories in improving their operations.

The conference decided that grain joint procurement committees should be established in major and medium-sized cities under the leadership of local industry and commerce departments to jointly purchase wheat. In terms of wheat prices, efforts should be made to maintain reasonable price differences between regions and reasonable price differences between wheat and flour, so that producers, distributors, and consumers all benefit, and flour production can proceed smoothly.

In addition, the conference also drafted quality standard plans for "August 1st Flour" and "September 2nd Rice." It is recommended that the central government review and approve their implementation.

The conference was led by the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Food Industry of the Central People's Government and hosted by the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation. It lasted 27 days from July 11 to August 6. Attendees included 105 representatives from public and private flour mills, rice mills, and industry and commerce authorities from various regions.

　　全国粮食加工会议
    制定全国面粉产销平衡计划
    根据以销定产原则分配一年生产任务
    【新华社十日讯】全国粮食加工会议已根据以销定产的原则，制定了今后一年（一九五○年六月至一九五一年五月）的全国面粉产销平衡计划。
    根据会议的汇报，上年度（去年六月至今年五月）全国面粉产量为五千三百余万袋，只占全国生产能力的百分之四十一点九，但实销后仍剩余五百余万袋。为了避免盲目生产和盲目运销所造成的损失，会议根据本年度购买力稍有增加的情况，决定本年度全国除东北以外共生产面粉五千四百一十万袋，其中中国粮食公司将委托加工二千一百四十万袋。各区产量根据各区可销数量分配如下：华东——二千五百五十余万袋；华北——一千七百万袋；中南——五百三十一万余袋；西南——九十八万袋；西北——五百三十万袋。因华北面粉工厂的开工率较大，故经各区代表协商后决定由华北区让出四百七十四万袋的销售数字容纳外区运销，以照顾开工率较低的地区。中国粮食公司的加工粮亦将更多地照顾开工率较低的华东区。
    会议决定各地贸易工商部门应领导和组织有关单位参加的面粉产销协商委员会，根据“公私兼顾”的原则，协商分配各区内的产销数字，并协助各厂改善经营。
    会议决定在各大、中城市由各地工商部门领导，成立粮食联合采购委员会，以便联合采购小麦。在小麦价格上，要设法保持地区间的合理差价及小麦与面粉的合理差价，使生产者、运销者、消费者三方面都有利，使面粉生产能够顺利进行。
    此外，会议并拟定了“八一粉”及“九二米”的质量标准方案。建议中央政府审核，选择批准实施。
    会议系由中央人民政府贸易部、食品工业部领导，由中国粮食公司主持，会期自七月十一日至八月六日共历时二十七天。出席者为各地公、私营面粉厂，米厂及工商主管部门代表共一百零五人。
