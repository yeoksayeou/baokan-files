　　US Making Australia into a Military Base
　　Menzies Government Willingly Sells Out Sovereignty and Acts as a Lackey Australian People Will Never Allow Their Country to Become a Base of Aggression
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 14th] Moscow dispatch from TASS: The latest issue of *New Times* magazine published an article by V. Vladimirova entitled "The 'Fifth Continent' in Wall Street's Plans."
　　The author writes: After suffering a crushing defeat in China, American expansionists are increasingly interested in Australia. They regard these territories of the British Empire as a "natural strategic unit" connected to the Americas and as a supply base for aggression against the people of Southeast Asian colonies and the People's Republic of China. They openly and formally instructed US Army, Navy, and Air Force attachés to submit detailed reports on all aspects of Australian defense.
　　Australian Prime Minister Menzies has already announced that "the closest" cooperation with the United States is the basic principle of his foreign policy. Recently, he concluded a secret agreement with Washington to hand over New Britain, New Ireland, and Manus Island to the United States for "protection," without even informing London of this fact. In addition, he plans to lease the northern part of Queensland to the US military authorities as a military base.
　　Today, the Menzies government is enthusiastically participating in the arms race and actively participating in preparing an aggressive Pacific Pact under US protection. One of the main purposes of Menzies' current visit to the United States and the United Kingdom is to accelerate the conclusion of the Pacific Pact.
　　Australia's military expenditure is increasing year by year. In the 1948-1949 fiscal year, it was 61 million pounds, and in the 1949-1950 fiscal year, it had increased to 64 million pounds, while the total amount of expenses related to war preparations hidden under other budget items is much larger than this figure. The government increases the taxes on the working people in order to pass the heavy burden of huge military expenditure onto them.
　　The Menzies government has adopted barbaric retaliatory measures against striking workers, arresting communists and persecuting their leader Sharkey. However, the people's resistance to war and fascism is becoming stronger and stronger. The Australian Ironworkers' Union, Miners' Union, Seamen's Union, and Waterside Workers' Union are fighting bravely to improve workers' living standards. Australian sailors are refusing to transport weapons used in the US aggression in the Korean War and the colonial war in Malaya. The Australian people are determined not to allow their country to become a base for imperialist aggression.

　　新时代发表专文揭露
    美使澳大利亚军事基地化
    孟席斯政府甘心出卖主权充当走卒  澳洲人民决不让祖国成为侵略基地
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：最近一期《新时代》杂志发表符拉第米罗娃的专文：“在华尔街的计划中的‘第五洲’”。
    作者写道：美国扩张主义者们在中国遭到一蹶不振的败北以后，对澳大利亚愈益感到兴趣。他们把大英帝国的这些领土，视为与美洲连在一起的“天然的战略单位”，和侵略东南亚各殖民地人民与侵略中华人民共和国的补给基地。他们公开而正式地叫美国陆、海、空军武官们提出关于澳大利亚国防的一切方面的详尽报告。
    澳总理孟席斯业已宣布：和美国“最密切地”合作，是他的外交政策的基本原则。最近，他和华盛顿缔结秘密协定，把新不列颠岛、新爱尔兰岛和马纳斯岛交与美国“保护”，甚至不把这一事实通知伦敦方面。此外，他还计划把昆士兰的北部租借给美国军事当局作为军事基地。
    今天，孟席斯政府正热心地参加军备竞赛，并积极地参加筹备一个在美国保护下的侵略性的太平洋公约。孟席斯目前访问美英两国的主要目的之一，便是加速缔结太平洋公约。
    澳大利亚军费在逐年增加。一九四八——一九四九年度，是六千一百万镑，到一九四九——一九五○年度已增至六千四百万镑，而隐蔽在其他预算项目下与备战有关的费用总额，则比这个数字还要大得多。政府增加劳动人民负担的赋税，以便把庞大的军费重荷压到他们身上。
    孟席斯政府已采取野蛮的报复手段，对付罢工的工人们，并逮捕共产党人和迫害其领袖夏基。然而，人民对战争和法西斯主义的反抗却越来越坚强有力。澳大利亚铁工工会、矿工工会、海员工会和码头工人工会，正为改善工人生活标准勇猛地战斗着。澳洲的海员们正在拒运美国侵略朝鲜战争中和马来亚殖民战争中使用的武器。澳大利亚人民已经决心不让他们的国家成为帝国主义侵略的基地。
