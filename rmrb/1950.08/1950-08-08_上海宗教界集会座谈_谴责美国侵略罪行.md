　　Shanghai Religious Circles Hold Meetings and Symposia
    Condemn U.S. Aggression Crimes

    [This Newspaper’s News] Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Shanghai Buddhist, Hui (Muslim), and Christian Associations held a symposium on August 2nd to oppose U.S. aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Representatives from the Buddhist community included Fang Zifan, Weifang, Dayuan, Shaozong, Lin Ziqing, and Su Huichun; representatives from the Hui community included Zhang Yaoting, Jin Youyun, Yang Shuping, Ma Xintian, Ma Jinpeng, and Ma Renbin; representatives from the Christian community included Wu Yaozong, Deng Yuzhi, Liu Liangmo, Ai Niansan, Chen Hexiang, Luo Guanzong, and Yin Xiang, totaling more than 40 people. During their speeches, the attending representatives expressed great anger at the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. The meeting unanimously passed a declaration on this matter, condemning the U.S. imperialists’ bestial acts of slaughtering the Korean people; and sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, Korean people's leader General Kim Il-sung, and the Korean people to express their respects. The declaration passed by the meeting stated in brief: We, the followers of Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity in Shanghai, lodge a serious protest and condemnation against the U.S. imperialists’ atrocities of aggression against Taiwan and Korea! The whole world knows that Taiwan is our Chinese territory, yet the U.S. imperialists dare to defy the world and interfere with our country's liberation of Taiwan. Commander-in-Chief Zhu pointed out at the "August 1st" Commemoration Meeting: "We must liberate our territory of Taiwan." This is the will of all the Chinese people. The U.S. army attacked Korea, turning Korea's fertile fields into battlefields; U.S. planes indiscriminately bombed peaceful cities and villages in Korea, blindly bombing and shooting innocent rural women and innocent children, slaughtering them. We must call on religious believers throughout Asia and the world to rise up and resolutely oppose the inhumane and unjust bestial acts of U.S. imperialism! In particular, we must call on religious believers in the United States who uphold peace and justice to quickly rise up to oppose the Truman government's criminal acts of slaughtering the Asian people!
