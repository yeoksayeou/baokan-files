Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 25th: The Korean student delegation received a warm welcome at the Second World Student Congress. The Korean delegation included People's Army soldiers in military uniform and patriotic students who had just been liberated from the prisons of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. Representing the heroic Korean people who defeated the American aggressors, they were greeted with cheers and respect everywhere.

Youth and students from various countries presented a large number of gifts to the Korean delegation, enough to fill a train car. These included three ambulances donated by workers from state-owned enterprises in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania, dozens of boxes of medical equipment and medicines, and a donation of 200,000 Czech crowns. Student representatives from China, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Democratic Greece, and India also presented various gifts to the Korean delegation. Progressive American students sent a banner embroidered with the words "Get out of Korea." Kang Buk, head of the Korean delegation, said, "These gifts represent the solidarity of the people of the world who are fighting for peace and democracy with the Korean people. This makes us feel supremely honored. We will bring this great friendship and support to the people of Korea and their army."

The people of Czechoslovakia warmly welcomed the Korean student representatives. The Czechoslovakian Trade Union Congress has established a fund to aid Korean refugees at the request of workers from all over the country. On the afternoon of the 20th, when the Korean representatives were sightseeing in the suburbs of Prague, an elderly mother with white hair took off the gold necklace around her neck and handed it to them, saying, "I wish Korea an early independence and liberation."

    各国学生代表与工人纷向朝鲜代表献礼物
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】在第二届世界学生代表大会上，朝鲜的学生代表团受到热烈的欢迎。朝鲜代表团中有身着戎装的人民军战士，和刚从李承晚匪帮的监狱中解放出来的爱国学生们。他们代表了战败美国侵略者的英雄朝鲜人民，到处接受了欢呼和尊敬。
    各国的青年学生与工人向朝鲜代表团献赠了大批礼物，足够装满一个火车厢。其中包括捷、匈、罗等国国营企业工人所赠送的三辆救护车，数十箱医药器械与药品，和二十万克朗（捷币）的捐款。中国、德意志民主共和国、波兰、民主希腊及印度的学生代表，也向朝鲜代表团馈赠了各式各样的礼品。美国进步学生送了一幅锦旗，上面绣着“退出朝鲜去”的字样。朝鲜代表团团长康北说：“这些礼物表示了全世界为和平、民主而斗争的人民和朝鲜人民的团结一致。这使我们感到了无上的光荣。我们要把这种伟大的友谊与支持，带给朝鲜的人民和他们的军队。”
    捷克斯洛伐克的人民热烈欢迎了朝鲜学生代表。捷克总工会已应各地工人的要求，成立了援助朝鲜被难人民基金会。在二十日下午，当朝鲜代表到布拉格郊外观光的时候，一位白发苍苍的老母亲解下了胸前的金项链交给他们说：“我祝福朝鲜早日获得独立和解放。”
