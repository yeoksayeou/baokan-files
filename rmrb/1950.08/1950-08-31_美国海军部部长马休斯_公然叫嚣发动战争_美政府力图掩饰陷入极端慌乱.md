　　Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Matthews, a key member of the U.S. government, delivered a speech in Boston on the evening of August 25th, openly announcing the U.S. ruling clique's plan to expand its war of aggression. Under the guise of "for peace," Matthews said: "For peace, we should be willing to pay any price -- even the price of starting a war, and we should openly declare this intention." Matthews even shamelessly said, "Although we will therefore receive the title of initiator of a war of aggression," "we can accept it with a clear conscience." Matthews said: "This is a cause to which we must contribute all and our last resources." "We have no other path to follow."
    Matthews's speech, though merely announcing the U.S. government's plan to expand its war of aggression, which it is already carrying out in practice but has not announced, caused extreme panic in the U.S. government, which is trying to cover up this plan of aggression. According to the Associated Press, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson was "shocked and angered" by this. Therefore, a State Department spokesman nervously issued a statement on the 26th, saying: "The Secretary of the Navy's speech was not approved by the State Department in advance." The spokesman also said: "Mr. Matthews's words about starting a war for peace do not represent American policy." (Agence France-Presse, Washington, August 26th) The White House press office also quickly issued a statement, stating that Matthews's speech "had not been reviewed by the White House either." Subsequently, Matthews himself also issued a statement saying: "I did not intend to speak on behalf of the government. I did not say: we should start a war."
    Matthews's speech and the statements by the U.S. State Department and White House spokesmen, on the one hand, show the U.S. government's deliberate intention to expand its war of aggression, and on the other hand, also show that even the U.S. government cannot but feel the pressure of the growing world movement to defend peace. The State Department and the White House feared that Matthews's overly frank confession would definitively expose the hideous face of the American war criminal, and would inevitably arouse the people of the world to rise up even more actively to condemn the politically isolated American aggressors.

### 美国海军部部长马休斯  公然叫嚣发动战争  美政府力图掩饰陷入极端慌乱

　　美国海军部部长马休斯
    公然叫嚣发动战争
    美政府力图掩饰陷入极端慌乱
    【新华社二十九日讯】美国政府要员之一、海军部长马休斯于八月二十五日晚在波士顿发表演说，公开宣布了美国统治集团准备扩大侵略战争的计划。马休斯在“为了和平”的借口之下说：“为了和平，我们应该甘愿偿付任何代价——甚至发动战争的代价，而且我们应该公开宣布这种意图。”马休斯甚至恬不知耻地说：“虽然我们将因此得到侵略战争发动者的称号”，“我们可以心安理得地接受”。马休斯说：“这是一件我们不得不贡献出我们全部以及最后资源的事业”。“我们别无他途可循”。
    马休斯的演说，虽然只是宣布了美国政府正在实际进行而没有宣布的扩大侵略战争的计划，可是这却引起了力图掩饰这一侵略计划的美国政府的极端的慌乱。据合众社称，美国务卿艾奇逊为此“震愕发怒”。因此，国务院发言人慌乱地于二十六日发表声明称：“海军部长的演说，事先并未获得国务院的同意”。发言人并称：“马休斯先生关于为了和平而发动战争的话并不代表美国的政策”。（法新社华盛顿二十六日电）白宫新闻处也赶紧发表声明，表示马休斯的演辞“也未经白宫审阅”。接着，马休斯本人也发表谈话说：“我无意代表政府说话。我没有说：我们应该发动战争”。
    马休斯的演说和美国国务院及白宫发言人的声明，一方面表示了美国政府蓄意扩大侵略战争，同时也表示了甚至美国政府也不能不感受着日益增涨的世界保卫和平运动的压力。国务院和白宫害怕马休斯这种过于坦白的自供，会把美国的战争罪魁的狰狞面目最后地暴露，因而势必引起全世界人民更加积极地起来声讨在政治上孤立的美国侵略者。
