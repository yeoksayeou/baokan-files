The First National Congress of Natural Science Workers of the People's Republic of China opened in Beijing on the 18th. 451 representatives of scientific workers from various fields of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine from major administrative regions participated in this meeting, demonstrating the great unity of over 50,000 scientific workers in China. The main contents of this meeting are: to preliminarily understand the scientific and technological problems existing in the country's industry, agriculture, and healthcare, and to study solutions; to discuss the opinions and proposals of various aspects of the scientific and technological community, and to submit the conclusions of the discussions to the relevant government departments for reference; to promote the reorganization and establishment of specialized scientific and technological societies, to formulate the organizational methods of the federation of specialized societies, and to initiate the organization of a national association for popularizing scientific and technological knowledge.

The conference was opened by Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Congress. Wu Yuzhang first pointed out that the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "Strive to develop natural science to serve the construction of industry, agriculture, and national defense. Reward scientific discoveries and inventions, and popularize scientific knowledge." Our country needs a comprehensive economic construction plan, therefore, our scientific work must be planned. This planned scientific work is closely related to national economic construction, and it is responsible for solving the problems raised by the government and production departments. In this way, it links theory with practice. At the same time, it must also solve problems with new methods of collective work. He also pointed out that science must be improved, popularized, and expanded to the local level, so that scientific research institutions and practical places can be found throughout the country, and science can be deeply and widely transmitted to the masses. We must advance steadily in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner. Regarding the unity of natural science workers, Wu Yuzhang pointed out that there was a serious phenomenon of disunity in the Chinese scientific community in the past; however, after liberation, the scientific community has made significant progress and achievements in eliminating barriers and cooperating in unity, and it must be more united in the future. He finally pointed out: Today, the scientific community must be organized, because only with organization can we better promote our work. Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Premier Huang Yanpei, Deputy Director Ma Xulun, Minister Zhang Bojun, Deputy Mayor Wu Han and others all delivered speeches. They all unanimously hoped that natural science workers would unite, serve the broad masses of the people, and serve the construction of the new China.

    【新华社十八日讯】中华全国第一次自然科学工作者代表会议于十八日在北京开幕。参加这次会议的有各大行政区的理、工、农、医各方面的科学工作者代表四百五十一人，表现了中国五万余科学工作者的大团结。这次会议主要内容是：初步了解国内工业、农业和保健方面存在着的科学技术问题，并研究解决的办法；讨论科学技术界各方面的意见与提案，并将讨论的结论分别提交政府有关部门作参考；促进科学技术专门学会的整理和设立，拟定专门学会联合会组织的方式，同时发起组织全国性科学技术知识普及协会。中央人民政府副主席朱德、李济深、中央人民政府政务院副总理黄炎培、中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会副主任马叙伦、中央人民政府交通部长章伯钧、中央人民政府水利部长傅作义、北京市副市长吴晗等都出席指导。
    会议由大会主席团主席吴玉章致开幕词。吴玉章首先指出，人民政协共同纲领规定：“努力发展自然科学，以服务于工业农业和国防的建设。奖励科学的发现和发明，普及科学知识”。我们国家需要一个全面的经济建设计划，因此，我们的科学工作要有计划性。这个计划性的科学工作，和国家经济建设有着密切的联系，它负责解决政府和生产部门所提出的问题。这样，它就把理论和实际联系起来。同时，它也就必须以集体工作的新方法来解决问题。他又指出，科学要提高，还要普及，还要向地方扩展，使科学研究机关和实用场所遍于全国，使科学不只深入而广泛地传达到群众中去。我们必须有计划、有步骤、有重点地稳步前进。关于自然科学工作者的团结问题，吴玉章指出，过去中国科学界存在严重的不团结的现象；但在解放后科学界在消除隔膜、团结合作方面，有了显著的表现和成就，今后必须要更加团结。他最后指出：今天科学界要有组织，因为有组织才能更好地推进工作。朱德副主席、李济深副主席、黄炎培副总理、马叙伦副主任、章伯钧部长、吴晗副市长等都发表了讲演。他们都一致希望自然科学工作者团结起来，为广大人民服务，为新中国的建设事业服务。
