Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 28th: The following is the full text of the report by Wang Feng, Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Nationalities Affairs Committee, on "The Current Situation and Tasks of Ethnic Work in Northwest China" at the first plenary meeting of the committee on July 21st:

Comrades, Gentlemen:

The first meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Nationalities Affairs Committee opens today. All of you, comrades and friends who have been invited to participate in the meeting, come from various ethnic groups and regions of Northwest China. It is an unprecedented event in history that we are gathered together to discuss major issues related to the people of all ethnic groups in Northwest China.

The Northwest is a multi-ethnic region, with nearly twenty ethnic groups, including Han, Uygur, Hui, Tibetan, Kazakh, Mongolian, Tatar, and Tu, with a total population of nearly seven million, accounting for about a quarter of the total population of the Northwest. Historically, there was disunity among the ethnic groups, which was created by the reactionary ruling class. For thousands of years, from the feudal dynasties to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, they oppressed not only their own people, but also especially the minority ethnic groups. This oppression was the implementation of reactionary rule of Han chauvinism in minority areas, depriving minority ethnic groups of their political rights, plundering their property, forcing unequal trade, and inflicting various forms of exploitation and humiliation, especially countless times inciting ethnic disputes and brutally massacring people of minority ethnic groups. The crimes of the reactionary ruling class throughout history are countless. This situation only began to change fundamentally after the founding of the People's Republic of China and the basic victory of the People's Liberation War on the mainland.

Carry out work in accordance with the policy of ethnic equality to lay the foundation for greater unity among all ethnic groups

The Northwest People's Government and the Communist Party resolutely implement the policy of ethnic equality in the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference and have carried out the following work: (1) Mobilizing the masses of all ethnic groups to actively assist the People's Liberation Army, quickly annihilating the Hu and Ma bandit gangs, liberating the entire Northwest, and continuously eliminating bandits and secret agents, so that social order is initially stabilized and the lives and property of people of all ethnic groups and strata are guaranteed, and favorable conditions are created for the people of all ethnic groups to restore production. (2) The Northwest Military and Political Committee and the people's governments of various provinces are joint governments established in accordance with the principle of ethnic equality by all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, and all democratic parties. This government has raised the political status of the people of all ethnic groups and has won the enthusiastic support of the people of all ethnic groups and strata. (3) Local people's governments have absorbed and trained more than 2,000 working cadres from various ethnic groups, and continue to work hard to promote minority ethnic cadres to leadership positions at all levels in a planned and unreserved manner to take on various responsible tasks, in order to train and improve them. (4) Local people's governments have begun to pay attention to helping various minority ethnic groups restore their production, especially state-owned trade organizations carrying out fair and free trade in ethnic minority areas, purchasing local products such as fur, casings, highland barley, and medicinal materials from the people of all ethnic groups, which has been warmly welcomed by the local people and stimulated the productive enthusiasm of all ethnic groups. (5) Local people's governments have adopted methods such as eliminating estrangement, strengthening unity, and convening unity conferences and friendship meetings of representatives of all ethnic groups to fully consult and mediate disputes between and within ethnic groups, which have achieved great results.

Due to the above practical work done by local people's governments, a good start has been made in establishing a new relationship of unity, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation among ethnic groups, thereby laying the foundation for greater unity and common construction among all ethnic groups in the future. However, we must not ignore that there are still many shortcomings or errors in our work, the main ones being: insufficient understanding and attention to the local ethnic situation and its characteristics, and some cadres not proceeding from specific realities but rigidly applying the general work experience of the Han areas. There is a considerable degree of simplistic approaches, impatience, and many Han cadres consciously or unconsciously harbor remnants of Han chauvinism. Some people believe that minority ethnic cadres have low levels of education, shallow qualifications, and lack work experience, and therefore do not pay enough attention to cultivating and promoting cadres from all ethnic groups; many cadres do not pay attention to respecting the customs and habits of various ethnic groups, regarding them as mere details of life; some trade and taxation departments have not listened well to the opinions of local minority ethnic people and improved their working methods; certain social democratic reform undertakings do not take into account the level of awareness of local masses and are done too early or inappropriately; some cadres have serious tendencies of commandism and are detached from the masses. These shortcomings and errors must be corrected with concrete and effective measures. It is undeniable that many Han cadres working in minority areas are actively working hard and achieving results, but only by correcting these shortcomings and errors can they better unite with the people of all ethnic groups and do a good job.

Implement a prudent and steady approach and do a good job in the current eight tasks

Based on the work experience since liberation and the economic, cultural, religious, belief, customs, habits, and psychological feelings of the various ethnic groups in the Northwest, ethnic work in the Northwest is still fraught with problems. Therefore, in our work in minority areas, we must implement a prudent and steady working approach and take different work steps from those in general Han areas. We must prepare to first use three to five years to actively cultivate and promote a large number of cadres from the minority ethnic groups themselves, carry out various tasks, and mobilize the masses to promote friendship and unity among all ethnic groups and within each ethnic group. Then, on the basis of a general improvement in the political awareness of the people of all minority ethnic groups, we will carry out various necessary reforms under the principle of the voluntary will of the people of their own ethnic groups, and then devote all our efforts to developing the economic and cultural undertakings of the people of all ethnic groups, and jointly building a new democratic Northwest. Based on this approach, the following eight tasks must be done at present:

(1) Mobilize the broad masses of all ethnic groups to actively assist the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police to continue to eliminate bandits, secret agents, and saboteurs, stabilize social order, and protect the people's peace and contentment.

(2) Carry out extensive propaganda work. Publicize the policy of ethnic equality in the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and publicize the specific regulations of the Central People's Government and the Northwest Military and Political Committee on ethnic policies. Publicize the deeds of labor, unity, and progress of the people of all ethnic groups. Adopt the languages, writing, and methods favored by the masses of all ethnic groups to carry out propaganda. We must ensure that our principles, tasks, policies, and methods for working in minority areas are widely disseminated and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

(3) Replenish and establish a joint government of people of all ethnic groups and strata, and gradually implement ethnic regional autonomy. The specific methods are:

A. In agricultural areas and pastoral areas where ethnic groups live together, universally select minority ethnic people who are supported by the local masses and are enthusiastic about serving the masses to serve as responsible officials (such as commissioners, county heads, district heads, township heads, etc.) to ensure that they have the position, power, and responsibility. Implement joint autonomy of all ethnic groups. When conditions permit, elect representatives of all ethnic groups and strata to the congress of representatives based on the population ratio. If the population of a certain ethnic group in a certain area is particularly small, appropriate consideration should be given when electing representatives. When conditions are ripe, this congress of representatives will exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress.

B. In agricultural areas where a single minority ethnic group lives in compact communities, ethnic regional autonomy will be implemented in any area that can constitute an administrative unit (such as townships, districts, and counties). In pastoral areas where a single minority ethnic group lives in compact communities, the provincial people's government may, at present, rely on the original administrative organs (such as Mongol banners, various Tibetan tribes, thousand-household and hundred-household units, etc.) to exercise the functions and powers of the people's government through a system of appointment, and gradually implement democratic reforms in order to implement ethnic regional autonomy.

(4) Actively restore and develop the production of the people of all minority ethnic groups. In agricultural areas, the main task is to repair water conservancy projects, expand the cultivated area, and pay attention to improving farming methods. The burden of public grain must be based on the actual conditions in various places, improve the collection methods, and strive for simple procedures; in pastoral areas, state-owned trade organizations should continue to make great efforts to purchase local products such as fur and wool, and transport and sell daily necessities to the local area; in taxation work, special attention should be paid to simplifying the tax system and collection procedures, and attention should be paid to gradually promoting veterinary prevention work. Actively support the development of industry and commerce of various minority ethnic groups. Various industries and businesses run by Han people in minority areas should be protected and encouraged to develop.

(5) Regarding cultural and educational undertakings in minority areas. The original school education undertakings should be restored first, and then developed. The education system and curriculum content should generally maintain the status quo, and gradually improve them in a prudent and steady manner. Political and ideological education should generally first teach "On New Democracy," important announcements of the Central People's Government, and various documents on ethnic policies. Only in its higher schools should necessary theoretical education be carried out. The religious beliefs and religious activities of the people should be based on their own free will, and the government should not interfere. Pay attention to the exchange of cultural arts and songs and dances of various ethnic groups, and promote medical and health and film undertakings in a step-by-step and planned manner.

(6) Mediate and stop ethnic disputes and continue to strengthen unity. In places where many ethnic groups live together, disputes between ethnic groups or within ethnic groups should be seriously observed and cautiously mediated. These disputes not only waste a lot of property, but also waste a lot of lives. In the past, people's governments at all levels have taken mediation measures to deal with these disputes, which is correct. However, attention should be paid to moving from mediating individual incidents to gaining an in-depth understanding of the social and historical roots of local ethnic disputes, and to persuading the masses of the ethnic groups concerned to select appropriate representatives to conduct full consultations, seek permanent solutions to eliminate disputes, and use this to educate the broad masses of all ethnic groups and raise their awareness. Only in this way can we gradually stop disputes between ethnic groups and enhance ethnic unity. This mediation work should be combined with mobilizing local masses to engage in agriculture, animal husbandry, and other sideline production, and should not be carried out in isolation.

(7) On the basis of carrying out the above work, establish and develop mass organizations in minority areas and cultivate a large number of minority cadres. In addition to educating and improving existing minority cadres and continuing to select and absorb people from various minority ethnic groups to participate in work, we must also run cadre schools and training courses well. Minority cadres must be used well, given concrete help in their work, and given necessary care in their lives. Only by cultivating and promoting a large number of cadres from all ethnic groups who can grasp policies can we do a good job in ethnic work.

(8) The cadre study in minority areas must proceed from the actual situation and formulate specific plans. At present, we should pay attention to strengthening investigation and research, understanding the situation, overcoming the old-fashioned practices of copying the experience of the Han areas and the simple, hasty, and commandist practices in our work, as well as the remnants of Han chauvinism in many Han cadres. Han cadres must take the initiative and conscientiously unite and help cadres from all minority ethnic groups wholeheartedly, and must not take over everything. Cadres from all minority ethnic groups should also pay attention to striving for other ethnic cadres to work with peace of mind in their own ethnic groups, unite closely, learn from each other, and work together to do a good job. To this end, the committee has specifically drafted "Documents for Cadre Study in Minority Areas" and "Matters Requiring Attention by Cadres Working in Minority Areas," and has submitted them to the Northwest Military and Political Committee for approval and promulgation.

As long as we persistently and tirelessly do the above eight tasks well, we can greatly enhance the friendly unity among all ethnic groups. And gradually improve and improve the economy, politics, and culture of the people of all minority ethnic groups, and create favorable conditions for building a new democratic society in various minority areas. This is our goal of struggle in minority areas in the recent period. Under such a goal, all people, except for a very few hidden spies and saboteurs, should unite and form a broad and strong united front of ethnic solidarity. As long as we unite well, we will certainly be able to do our work well.

　　西北目前民族工作情况和任务
    西北民族事务委员会主任委员汪锋在该会第一次全体会议上的报告
    【新华社西安二十八日电】西北军政委员会民族事务委员会主任委员汪锋在七月二十一日该会第一次全体会议上关于“西北目前民族工作的情况和任务”的报告，全文如下：各位委员、各位先生：
    西北军政委员会民族事务委员会第一次会议，今天开幕了。各位委员及各位被邀请参加会议的朋友，都是来自西北各民族、各地区，我们大家欢聚一堂，共同研讨有关西北各民族人民的重大问题，这是历史上空前未有的大事。
    西北是多民族地区，有汉族、维吾尔族、回族、藏族、哈萨克族、蒙古族、塔塔尔族、土族等将近二十个民族，各少数民族人口将近七百万，约占全西北总人口的四分之一。各民族之间，历史上是不团结的，这是过去反动统治阶级造成的，几千年来，从历代封建皇朝到蒋介石匪帮，都是既压迫本族人民，又特别压迫各少数民族人民的。这种压迫就是在少数民族地区实行大民族主义的反动统治，剥夺各少数民族的政治权利，抢掠他们的财产，强制进行不平等的贸易，给以各种压榨和污辱，特别是无数次地煽起民族纠纷，残酷屠杀各少数民族的人民等等。历史上反动统治阶级的罪恶，是不胜枚举的。这种情况在中华人民共和国成立和人民解放战争在大陆上基本胜利之后，才起了根本变化。
  按照民族平等政策进行工作打下各民族更加团结的基础
    西北各级人民政府和共产党是坚决执行人民政协共同纲领的民族平等政策的，并已进行了如下工作：（一）动员各族人民群众积极援助人民解放军，迅速地歼灭了胡、马匪帮，解放了全西北，并不断地肃清土匪特务，使社会秩序初步安定，各族各阶层人民生命财产有了保障，并给各族人民恢复生产创造了有利条件。（二）西北军政委员会和各省人民政府，是按照民族平等原则建立的各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派的联合政权。这个政权提高了各族人民的政治地位，获得了各族各阶层人民的热诚拥护。（三）各地人民政府已吸收和培养了二千多名各族人民的工作干部，并继续努力有计划地放手地提拔少数民族干部到各级领导机关中来担任各项负责工作，借以锻炼和提高。（四）各地人民政府已开始注意帮助各少数民族恢复其生产事业，特别是国营贸易机关在各民族地区进行公平自由的贸易，收购各族人民的土产如毛皮、肠衣、青稞、药材等，受到当地人民热烈欢迎，并刺激了各族人民的生产情绪。（五）各地人民政府对各地民族间与各民族内部的纠纷事件，采取消除隔阂，加强团结，召开各族人民代表的团结会、联谊会等办法，充分协商，进行调处，已获得很大成效。
    由于各地人民政府做了以上这些实际工作，各民族间团结互助、友爱合作的新关系的建立，已有了一个良好的开端，从而打下了今后各民族更加团结，共同建设的基础。但是绝不应忽视，我们在工作中还有很多缺点或错误，主要就是：对当地民族情况及其特点了解与重视不够，有些干部不从具体实际出发，而硬搬汉族地区的一般工作经验。相当地存在着简单方式，急躁情绪，很多汉族干部自觉或不自觉地存在着大民族主义的思想残余。有些人认为少数民族干部文化低，资格浅，没有工作锻炼，因而对培养和提拔各民族干部，没有足够的重视；许多干部对尊重各民族的风俗习惯，认作是生活细节，不加注意；有些贸易、税收机关，没有很好地倾听当地少数民族人民的意见，改善自己的工作方法，某些社会民主改革事业，不照顾当地群众觉悟程度，做得过早或不适当，某些干部有严重脱离群众的强迫命令作风等。这些缺点、错误，都必须采取具体有效的措施加以改正。不可否认，很多在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部，在工作中是积极努力埋头苦干并获得成绩的，但只有改正了以上这些缺点和错误，才能更好地和各民族人民群众团结在一起做好工作。
    实行谨慎稳进方针做好当前八项工作
    根据解放以来的工作经验及西北各民族的经济、文化、宗教、信仰、风俗习惯、人民心理感情等特点，西北民族工作仍然是问题很多的，因此我们在少数民族地区的工作，必须实行谨慎稳进的工作方针，必须采取与一般汉族地区不同的工作步骤。我们要准备首先用三、五年的时间，积极培养与大批提拔各少数民族自己的干部，进行各种工作，动员群众，以促进各民族和本民族内部相互间的友爱团结。然后在各少数民族人民群众的政治觉悟普遍提高的基础上，在其本民族人民自愿的原则下，去进行各种必要的改革，并进而全力发展各族群众的经济、文化事业，共同建设新民主主义的新西北。本此方针，提出当前必须做的八项工作如下：
    （一）发动各民族广大群众积极协助人民解放军，和人民公安部队继续进行消灭土匪、特务、破坏分子，安定社会秩序，保护人民安居乐业。
    （二）开展广泛的宣传工作。宣传人民政协共同纲领的民族平等政策，宣传中央人民政府和西北军政委员会关于民族政策方面的各种具体规定。宣传各族人民劳动、团结、进步的事迹。采取各民族的语言、文字及群众所喜爱的方式进行宣传。务使我们在少数民族地区工作的方针、任务、政策、办法广泛传播，深入人心。
    （三）充实和建立各民族各阶层人民联合政府，逐步实行民族区域自治。其具体办法：
    甲、在民族杂居的农业区域，和畜牧业地区，普遍地选拔为当地群众拥护而又热心为群众服务的少数民族人士，担任负责职务（如专员、县长、区长、乡长等），保证其有职有权有责。实行各民族联合自治，待条件许可时，按人口比例选出各民族的各界代表会议的代表，如某一地区某一民族人口特别少，选举代表时应适当照顾，并在条件成熟时，由这种代表会议代行人民代表大会的职权。
    乙、在单一的少数民族聚居的农业区域，凡可以构成行政单位者（如乡、区、县等），即实行民族区域自治。在单一的少数民族聚居的畜牧地区，目前可在原有行政机构（如蒙旗、藏族内部各族、千百户等）的基础上，由省人民政府，实行委任制，代行人民政府职权，逐步施行民主改革，以便实行民族区域自治。
    （四）积极恢复与发展各少数民族地区人民群众的生产事业。农业区域，主要是整修水利，扩大耕种面积，并注意改良农作法。公粮负担，须依据各地实际情况，改善征收办法，务求手续简便；畜牧业地区，国营贸易机关，继续用大力收购皮、毛等土产品，运售当地生活必需品；税收工作，特别注意简化税制及征收手续，并注意逐步推广兽医防治工作。积极扶助各少数民族工、商业的发展，汉族人民在少数民族地区经营之各种工、商业，应予以保护并鼓励其发展。
    （五）关于少数民族地区的文化教育事业。原有学校教育事业先行恢复，再求发展。教育制度和课程内容，一般维持原状，并采取谨慎、稳妥的办法逐步加以改进。政治思想教育，一般先教授“新民主主义论”、中央人民政府重要文告及民族政策的各种文件，只在其高级学校进行必需的理论教育，人民群众的宗教信仰和宗教活动，悉依自愿，政府不加干涉。注意交流各民族的文化艺术和歌舞等，有步骤有计划地推广医药卫生及电影事业。
    （六）调处和停止民族纠纷，继续加强团结。在多民族杂居的地方，各民族之间或各族内部的纠纷，应严重注视，谨慎调处，这些纠纷不仅损耗大量的财产，还损耗大量的生命。过去各级人民政府对这些纠纷事件采取调解办法，是正确的。但须注意要从调解个别事件，进而深入了解当地民族纠纷之社会的、历史的根源，劝导有关各民族群众选派适当代表人物，进行充分协商，寻求永久消除纠纷的办法，并借以教育各民族广大人民提高其觉悟。只有这样才能逐渐停止各民族间的纠纷，增进民族团结。这种调处工作，应与发动当地群众农业和畜牧业及其他副业生产相结合，不应孤立进行。
    （七）在进行上述工作的基础上，建立和发展各少数民族地区的群众组织，大量培养少数民族干部。除教育、提高现有少数民族干部，继续选拔、吸收各少数民族人士参加工作外，还须办好干部学校和训练班。对于少数民族干部，务须善为使用，在工作中多给具体帮助，在生活上给以必要的照顾。只有大批培养提拔各民族中能掌握政策的干部，才能做好民族工作。
    （八）在少数民族地区的干部学习，必须从实际情况出发，制定具体的计划。目前应注意加强调查研究，了解情况，克服工作中搬用汉人区经验的老一套作风和简单、急躁的强迫命令作风，以及许多汉族干部中的大民族主义思想残余。汉族干部必须主动地、负责地全心全意团结和帮助各少数民族干部，不能包办代替。各少数民族干部亦应注意争取其他民族干部在本族安心工作，密切团结，互相学习，共同努力，做好工作。为此，本会特拟定“少数民族地区干部学习文件”，和“少数民族地区工作干部必须注意事项”，呈请西北军政委员会批准后，公布施行。
    只要我们坚持不懈地努力做好上述八项工作，就可以大大增进各民族间的友好团结。并使各少数民族人民的经济、政治、文化逐步的获得改善和提高，及在各少数民族地区建设新民主主义社会，创造有利条件。这就是我们最近时期在少数民族地区奋斗的目标。在这样一个目标下，除开极少数的暗藏特务和破坏分子外，一切的人们，都应当团结起来，结成一个广泛的各民族坚强团结的统一战线。只要我们团结得好，就一定能将工作做好。
