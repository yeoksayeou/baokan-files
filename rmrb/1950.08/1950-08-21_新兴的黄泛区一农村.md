An Emerging Village in the Yellow River Flood Area
    Yao Changgan
    There is a village that was visited by Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng of the Central People's Government and Soviet experts, who traveled thousands of miles, and was visited by Wu Zhipu, Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, for condolences once each in the first half of this year. News reporters have come several times, one after another. This village is Nanling Village in Xihua County, Henan Province. Like thousands of other villages in the Yellow River flood area, Nanling Village was devastated by the Yellow River when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits breached the Yellow River embankment in Zhongmu in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. The farmers suffered more than ten years of wandering and begging. After liberation, with the help of the People's Government, these hardworking people actively reclaimed wasteland, planted crops, built houses, and bought livestock. Now it is a new village of more than two hundred farm families.

  Talking About the Past in a Green Field
    Looking west from Nanling Village, a green field of more than 5,700 mu extends to the horizon. The villagers excitedly told me that they had a bumper harvest on this land this year, with an average yield of more than 80 jin of wheat per mu on 4,000 mu of wheat fields. Now every family in Nanling Village has one or two full granaries of good wheat. After the wheat harvest, the farmers went to dig the Ying River, and livestock and farm tools were in short supply again. The Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Bureau, under the Central People's Government's Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee, used tractors to cultivate and plant 3,000 mu of mung beans for them. Because the plowing was deep and the sowing was even, and the women hoed diligently, the bean seedlings are now growing black and fat. A passerby who came here three years ago could not help but be surprised: how could a wilderness of mud and sand, reeds and weeds, have turned into green farmland in just three years?

    Farmer Ling Shun, an old man, explained this change most clearly. After the Yellow River receded in 1947, Ling Shun's family of six returned from Taikang County. At that time, there were reeds more than a meter deep everywhere, and it was almost impossible to find a way. They cut grass and sold it in Zhoukou City to make a living while reclaiming wasteland. At that time, without draught animals and farm tools, they used a wooden shovel to dig the soil, laboriously digging a piece of soil and sowing a handful of seeds, only digging a few fen of land a day. During this time, hunger and cold attacked them at any time.

    After Xihua County was liberated in 1948, the People's Government put forward the slogan "Whoever opens the land, plants the land, and harvests the land" to recruit refugees to return to their hometowns to cultivate. Every four farmers were given a new plow. More people returned home to reclaim wasteland, and their enthusiasm for reclaiming wasteland also increased. By the spring of last year, Ling Shun's family had 50 mu of land. Ling Shun said that in recent years, the People's Government has provided loans for mung beans (seeds) in the spring and wheat seeds in the autumn, and loans for buying livestock; they have also saved money and bought horses to accumulate fertilizer, so the wasteland has been cultivated year after year. This year, more than 30 mu of wheat yielded ten shi.

    Ling Shun gave a satisfactory evaluation of the arduous reclamation in the past two years. He said: "In the past, it could be said that I worked for the land for several years, but from now on, I will let the land work for me."

  The Story of Moving Houses
    The lack of housing is a huge difficulty in the lives of people in the flood area. Nanling Village has been rebuilt for three years, and they still live in small and low thatched houses. But for the farmers of Nanling Village themselves, they are living higher and higher.

    Ling Fuxin's daughter-in-law, when describing her family's living situation in recent years, said: "The year before last, before the People's Liberation Army came, my family lived in a broken tent that was moved around. It was freezing cold in the winter and drenched in the summer, and we couldn't find shelter. Later, we built a small "wopu" (shack), and the seven members of the family were squeezed together. It wasn't until the autumn of last year that we built two thatched houses."

    Last year and this year, more than two hundred new thatched houses have been built in Nanling Village. Many farmers still live in "wopu," but they have prepared some bricks, wheat straw, or have already built half of the mud walls, preparing to build houses in the winter. Bricks, tiles, and wood are extremely expensive in the Yellow River flood area, and bricks and tiles cannot be bought at all. But the current thatched houses all have a section of wall made of bricks, and there are incomprehensible soil pits everywhere in and out of the village. It was only after the villagers pointed it out that I learned about a "house moving" story.

    The original Nanling Village has been buried underground by silt, and the remaining thirty or so tile houses have also been buried halfway. In the spring of last year, in order to solve the problem of housing shortage, the People's Government mobilized farmers to dig up the bricks underground. As a result, Nanling Village was dug up like a mine. Old people used their memories to survey the location of the old houses, and young people actively dug pits. After a month or two, bricks, wooden pillars, millstones, and stone rollers were turned over one by one as their owners turned over. They helped each other build houses during slack seasons. Soon, they moved the houses back to the ground.

  "Life is Getting Better and Better"
    Sunset is the liveliest time of day in the village. Farmers who have been busy all day squat in the fields to eat dinner. At this time, if you approach, you will hear: "Comrades, noodles and steamed buns are the most luxurious things here. Life is getting better and better. Last year and the year before last, most families still ate wild vegetables and drank thin porridge!"

    Ling Jinzhou, the director of the Nanling Village Farmers' Association, only harvested enough grain to eat for half a year the year before last. Last year's harvest was more, but there was still a shortage of more than a month's worth of grain until this year. This year, the People's Government repaired the Ying River, providing work as a form of relief. In this way, men went to repair the river, and women ground flour for the river workers, which helped them get through the spring famine. This year is much better. The summer harvest of seven shi of wheat and four shi of barley is almost enough for a year's worth of food. If the grain harvested by the farmers of Nanling Village in recent years were all used for food, the shortage would not have been so great. Every time after the grain is harvested, they have to sell some to exchange for money to buy farm tools or livestock. For the sake of future happiness, they are willing to endure more hardship. Three years ago, Nanling Village did not have a single head of livestock, and now there are one hundred and forty heads. Nanling Village is growing stronger day by day. The tragic years of "planting every year, fleeing every year" have disappeared with the receding Yellow River and the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who caused the Yellow River to flood.

  "Can't Forget the Pain Once the Scar Has Healed"
    Although the cultivated land in Nanling Village is not as fertile as it was before the Yellow River flooded, the houses are still crowded, and there is still a shortage of draught animals and farm tools, it will stride forward along the road of a prosperous new countryside under the support of the People's Government.

    Now, unless it is raining, it is difficult to find young and middle-aged people in Nanling Village during the day, and there are very few women as well. Ling Timing said: "It is still relatively idle now. During the one or two months of wheat harvesting and autumn planting, everyone goes out under the dim light of the stars in the morning and returns under the dark light of the stars in the evening." For the past three years, the farmers in the Yellow River flood area have been living under this kind of intense labor. They will not easily forget the disaster caused by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, so they are particularly cherish today's good times. "Labor is glorious" has become a household name here. In this way, Nanling Village has also shown a high degree of revolutionary love for the People's Government. This year, the wheat harvest was good, and the People's Government levied a small amount of public grain for the first time. When the official document for grain requisition arrived in the village, the public opinion in the village was: "We have it, we should hand it over. This is for us to hand over grain for ourselves. The relief grain distributed by the People's Government in recent years is several times more than this." Then, there was a heated competition in the village to pick, clean, and dry the grain. On the eve of handing over the grain on "August 1st," they were chatting and laughing, organizing a grain delivery procession of "carts like flowing water and horses like dragons," heading towards the county grain depot.

    The villagers of Nanling Village say that all of this is because "Can't forget the pain once the scar has healed."

### 新兴的黄泛区一农村

　　新兴的黄泛区一农村
    姚昌淦
    有一个村子，在今年的上半年内，中央人民政府农业部部长李书城和苏联专家不远万里来视察过一次，河南省人民政府主席吴芝圃来慰问过一次，新闻记者们接二连三地来过好几次。这个村子就是河南省西华县的南凌村。南凌村和黄泛区千百个农村一样，因抗战初期蒋匪在中牟决开黄河堤岸，给黄水毁灭得光溜溜的，农民饱受了十几年逃难讨饭的生活折磨。解放以后，这些勤劳的人民在人民政府帮助下，积极地开荒地、种庄稼、盖房屋、买牲口，如今已经是一个二百多户农家的新村了。
  一片绿野话当年
    出南凌村向西展望，面积达五千七百余亩的一片绿野远连天际。老乡们兴奋地告诉我：就在这块土地上，今年他们获得了一次丰收，四千亩麦田每亩平均收麦八十余斤。现在南凌村家家都有满满的一两囤好麦子。割麦以后，农民们挖颍河去了，牲口和农具又缺。中央人民政府黄泛区复兴委员会所属复兴局，用拖拉机为他们代耕代种了三千亩绿豆。因为犁的深，播的匀，加以妇女们锄的勤，到现在豆苗长得又黑又肥。三年前的过路人再来这里不禁要吃惊：才三年时间，怎么一片泥淖和飞沙，芦苇和野草的荒野就变成了碧绿的农田？
    这个变化，农民凌顺老汉谈的最清楚。一九四七年黄水退去后，凌顺老汉一家六口人从太康县逃回来，那时到处是一人多深的芦苇，简直找不着路。他们一面割草到周口市去卖以维持生活，一面开荒。那时没有耕畜和农具，他们用一把木锨刨土，艰难地刨一块土播一把种，一天只刨得几分地。这中间饥饿和寒冻随时袭击着他们。
    一九四八年西华县解放以后，人民政府提出“谁开谁种、谁种谁收”的口号，招抚难民回籍开垦。每四家农民发给一张新犁。回家开荒的多了，开荒劲头也大了。到去年春天，凌顺老汉一家就有了五十亩地。凌顺老汉说：这几年人民政府逢春贷绿豆（种子）逢秋贷麦种、贷款买牲口；自己又省吃俭用，买马积肥，这样荒地也一年年地种熟了。今年三十多亩小麦整收了十石。
    凌顺老汉对前两年的艰苦开垦作了一个满意的评价。他说：“以前算是我为地干了几年活，以后就叫地为我干活了。”
  房子搬家的故事
    住房缺乏是泛区人民生活上极大的困难。南凌村重建已经三年了，现在住的还是狭小而低矮的茅草房。但对南凌村农民自己说来，他们是越住越高了。
    农民凌福新的媳妇在描述她家这几年居住的情形时说：“大前年，解放军还没有来，俺家住个搬来搬去的破篷帐，冬天冻死人，夏天淋死人，躲不住身。后来搭了个小窝铺（草棚），一家七口挤的不行。到去年秋天才盖起了两间草房。”
    去年和今年，南凌村新盖起了二百多间草房，许多农民还住着“窝铺”，只是准备了一些砖头、麦草，或者已打有半截土墙，准备冬天盖房。黄泛区砖瓦木料极贵，而且砖瓦根本无处可买。但现在的茅草房都有一截用砖头砌的墙脚，村里村外到处是一个一个的令人不懂的土坑。经老乡们指点才知道这其间有一段“房子搬家”的故事。
    原来的南凌村已被淤泥埋入地下，残存的三十几间瓦房也被埋了半截。去年春季，人民政府为解决缺房的困难，发动农民挖地下的砖。于是，南凌村像开矿一样地挖开了，老年人凭着记忆勘测旧房的所在，青年人就积极挖坑，一个月，两个月，砖头、木柱、磨子、石磙一一随着它们主人的翻身而翻身了。他们农闲的时候就互助盖房，你帮我，我帮你。不久，又把房子搬在地面上来了。
  “日子越过越得法”
    太阳偏西是村子里一天最热闹的时候，忙了一天的农民都蹲在场子上吃晚饭。这时，你走近去，就会听说：“同志，面条和馍馍是我们这里顶阔气的东西，日子越过越得法了。去年和前年还有大部分人家吃野菜喝稀糊涂呢！”
    南凌村农会主任凌锦洲前年打的粮食只够吃半年，去年收的多些，但到今年还差一个多月的粮食。今年人民政府修治颍河，以工代赈，这样，男人去修河，妇女替河工磨面，才度过了春荒。今年就强得多了，夏季收了七石小麦和四石大麦，就将近一年的口粮。秋季收了绿豆，粮食还有多余的。这几年南凌村农民打的粮食如果全部拿来吃，缺粮也不会缺得那样多。他们，每当粮食收下之后，都要出卖点，换钱买农具或牲口。为了明天的幸福，他们宁愿再受些艰苦。三年前，南凌村一头牲口也没有，现在有一百四十头了。南凌村已一天天地茁壮起来，那“年年种地、年年逃荒”的惨痛岁月，已随着黄水的退去，随着制造黄水泛滥的蒋匪帮的溃灭一去不复返了。
  “好了疮疤忘不了痛”
    尽管南凌村耕地还没有黄水泛滥以前那样熟，房子住得还挤，耕畜农具还缺，但是，在人民政府的扶植下，它将循着一个富裕的新型农村的道路阔步迈进。
    现在若非下雨天，南凌村白天里很难找到青年人和壮年人，妇女也很少。凌体明说：“现在还比较闲了些，在割麦种秋的那一、两个月当中，大家都是天抹亮一片星出去，顶黑一片星回来。”三年来，黄泛区的农民一直就是在这种紧张劳动的情况下生活过来的。他们对蒋匪帮所造成的灾难不会轻易忘记，因此，对于今天的好光景就显得特别珍重。“劳动光荣”在这里已成为家喻户晓的道理。这样，南凌村对人民政府也表现了高度的革命热爱。今年麦收好，人民政府第一次征收了少数的一点公粮。当征粮的公文到村时，村里的舆论是：“俺们有了，应该交。这是为俺自己交粮。这几年人民政府发放的救济粮就有这几倍多。”接着，村里是一场热烈的捡净晒干的竞赛。到“八一”交粮的前夕，他们就有说有笑地整着“车如流水马如龙”的送粮行列，朝县城粮库进发。
    这一切，南凌村老乡们的说法是：“好了疮疤忘不了痛。”
