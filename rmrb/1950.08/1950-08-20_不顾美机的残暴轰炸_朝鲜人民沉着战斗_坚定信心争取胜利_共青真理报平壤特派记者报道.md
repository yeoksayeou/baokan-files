Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: According to TASS, Komsomolskaya Pravda's special correspondent Kokin reports from Pyongyang: Angered by the shameful failures at the front, the American aggressors brutally bomb and destroy Korean cities and villages, massacring peaceful residents. American planes have twice destroyed ten railway bridges, but each time, hundreds of workers working in shifts in factories and farmers from nearby villages rush over and help build the bridges selflessly. Among them are adults and teenagers, men and women.

While working for the needs of the front, the Korean people are also consolidating the achievements of democracy. A large school has been newly established in Koyong City (transliteration). Well-equipped hospitals have also been established. If there are no air raids in the evening, first-class Korean films will be shown in cinemas. Business in the shops has not become slow, the business of the cooperatives is also thriving, and public canteens have opened. Behind this ordinary day-to-day process, people feel a strong atmosphere of war, a serious and concentrated spirit and will.

Everywhere there are Korean maps with many red flags inserted, next to which are front-line communiqués. People gather there to watch. The news from the front excites them, strengthens their belief that victory will be achieved soon, and gives them new strength.

The names of outstanding heroes of the People's Army who have achieved heroic feats are well-known. The name of Kim Ki-ok, a young pilot who shot down ten American planes, has become a symbol of the fearless spirit of Korean soldiers. The feats of thousands of other young heroes demonstrate the indomitable will of the Korean people and youth to strive for victory. The spiritual strength of the heroic people has been fully exerted, and they are defending their right to freedom and happiness with weapons in hand.

　　不顾美机的残暴轰炸
    朝鲜人民沉着战斗  坚定信心争取胜利
    共青真理报平壤特派记者报道
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：共青真理报特派记者科金自平壤报道：美国侵略者为前线的可耻失败所激怒，于是就残暴地进行轰炸，破坏朝鲜的城市与乡村，屠杀和平居民。美国飞机曾两度破坏十座铁路的桥梁，但是，每次都有数百名在工厂里整班工作的工人和邻近村庄的农民跑来，奋不顾身地帮助架桥。他们当中有成年人和少年人、男人和妇女。
    朝鲜人民一方面为前线的需要而工作，同时还在巩固民主的成果。在科勇城（译音）新建立了一座大的学校。设备良好的医院也建立起来了。如果晚间没有空袭，朝鲜第一流的影片就会在电影院放映。商店的买卖并没有变得清淡，合作社的业务也很兴隆，公共食堂已经开幕。在这普通的一天的过程后面，人们感到强烈的战争气氛、严肃集中的精神和意志。
    到处有插着许多面红旗的朝鲜地图，地图的旁边就是前线公报。人民围在那里看。前线的消息使他们兴奋，加强了他们不久就要获得胜利的信念，并给了他们新的力量。
    获得了英勇战绩的人民军杰出英雄的名字已脍炙人口。曾击落美机十架的青年驾驶员金基玉的名字已成为朝鲜战士无畏精神的象征。成千的其他青年英雄的功勋表现了朝鲜人民和青年争取胜利的不屈不挠的意志。英雄的人民的精神力量已经充分发挥，他们手持武器保卫着他们的自由和幸福的权利。
