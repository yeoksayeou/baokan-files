Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: Under the direction of MacArthur, the Yoshida government is actively recruiting remnants of Japanese fascists and organizing a so-called "Police Reserve Force," accelerating the rebuilding of the Japanese army to serve as an American tool of aggression. After the Yoshida government issued an order on the 9th to recruit 75,000 "Police Reserve Force" members, it began accepting registrations for the first batch of reserve members on the 12th. Fascist remnants, protected by the US and Japanese reactionaries, have become increasingly active and are eagerly registering. On the first day, 36,000 people registered. Some fascists, when registering, "even used their own blood to fill out the forms." Currently, about 7,000 of the first group of recruits have been selected and were concentrated on the 23rd at the "National Local Police Officer Training Schools" in Tokyo, Sapporo, Sendai, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Fukuoka to begin training.

Regarding the appointment of officers in the "Police Reserve Force," the US and Japanese reactionaries are planning to openly reinstate former Japanese army officers. According to an International News Service report, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida held secret talks with MacArthur on the evening of the 15th for more than an hour on this matter. At the same time, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsuo Okazaki brazenly announced the aggressive plot to reinstate former army officers to serve as officers in the "Police Reserve Force." He openly claimed that the purpose of the "Police Reserve Force" is to "serve as a national defense force" in the event that Japan is "invaded." Therefore, "the Cabinet approves of using former officers who have received basic military strategy education as police leaders, rather than untrained civilians." According to a Kyodo News report on the 11th, the "Police Reserve Force" has the same ranks as a regular army, including 65,000 privates, 8,500 non-commissioned officers, and 1,500 general and lieutenant-level senior officers. The American occupation forces will "lend" them "all necessary weapons."

　　美帝国主义加紧重新武装日本
    吉田政府招募法西斯余孽
    组织变相陆军警察后备队
    【新华社二十四日讯】在麦克阿瑟指使下，吉田政府正积极招募日本法西斯余孽，组织所谓“警察后备队”，加速重建日本陆军以充当美国的侵略工具。吉田政府在九日发表招募七万五千名“警察后备队”的命令后，即自十二日起开始办理第一批后备队队员的报名登记。在美、日反动派包庇下的法西斯余孽，至此益形活跃，纷纷报名，第一天报名者即达三万六千人。有些法西斯分子在报名时，“甚至用他们自己的血来填写表格”。现在，第一次录取者约七千名，已于二十三日分别集中到东京、札幌、仙台、大阪、广岛、福冈六地的“国家地方警察干部学校”，开始受训。
    关于“警察后备队”军官一级人员的任用问题，美、日反动派正在计划公开起用前日本陆军军官。据国际新闻社消息，日本首相吉田茂于十五日晚曾为此事与麦克阿瑟密谈一小时以上。同时，内阁书记长官冈崎胜男肆无忌惮地宣布了起用前陆军军官充任“警察后备队”军官的侵略阴谋。他公开声称：“警察后备队”的目的是在一旦日本“受侵略”时，“充当国防军”。因此，“内阁赞成起用受过基本军事策略教育的前军官为警察领袖，而不用未受过训练的平民”。另据共同社十一日讯，“警察后备队”具有和正规军队一样的官阶，其中计分兵卒级人员六万五千名，军士级人员八千五百名，将级及尉级高级军官一千五百名。美国占领军将“借给”他们“一切必要的武器”。
