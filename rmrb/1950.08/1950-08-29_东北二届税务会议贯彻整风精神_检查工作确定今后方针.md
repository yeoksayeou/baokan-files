　　Northeast Second Tax Conference Implements Rectification Spirit
    Reviews Work, and Determines Future Direction
    [Shenyang News] Northeast Daily News: The Northeast Second Tax Conference, which concluded on the 28th of last month, conducted a serious review of the tax work of the past six months in the spirit of rectification, and determined the future direction of work.

    The conference considered that: In the past six months, the tax work in the Northeast has achieved results, and this is the main aspect. First, the tax revenue task was completed in accordance with the state's tax policy, which is one of the important conditions for consolidating and balancing the financial revenue and expenditure of the entire Northeast, thereby ensuring investment in economic construction and stabilizing prices. The achievement of these results is the result of continuous improvement and upgrading of tax work, and the active efforts of tax workers. Secondly, due to the implementation of the tax policy in general, legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises have developed; especially private industry. Taking Shenyang as an example, according to statistics in April of this year: the number of factories increased by 105.6 percent compared with the early days of liberation, the number of employees increased by 116.6 percent, and capital increased by 140.4 percent from April last year to April this year.

    However, in the past six months, many shortcomings and deviations have also occurred, some of which are quite serious. The main problem is the imbalance of burden, with some being relatively light and others being excessively heavy. This phenomenon exists not only between regions, but also between industries and between households. The root causes of this phenomenon are mainly: 1. The leadership's systematic and comprehensive collection, analysis, comparison, and proactive control of tax source materials are insufficient. Therefore, the plan is one-sided, resulting in the phenomenon of the light remaining light and individual cases being excessively heavy, and failing to correct it in time. 2. A considerable number of industrial and commercial enterprises still conceal their business operations from the government. The government has to temporarily adopt the method of democratic appraisal to levy taxes in order to ensure the accuracy of the burden; but in actual implementation, because some industrial and commercial enterprises cannot conduct the appraisal frankly and openly, the accuracy that this method can achieve is weakened.

    Secondly, leading cadres have not paid enough attention to the planned cultivation and education of cadres, and timely and in-depth inspection of work. Some staff members still have varying degrees of shortcomings in their work style and policy thinking. The main problem is that their policy viewpoint is not strong. Sometimes they put the task in opposition to the policy, resulting in a certain phenomenon of deviating from the policy. Furthermore, their attitude is rigid, their methods are simple, and there are even individual cases of corruption and violation of discipline. For example, the former Fushun Tax Bureau discovered a collective corruption case headed by Ju Jinren, the director of the bureau. In addition, some systems and procedures in the past were not simplified enough, especially the accompanying invoices and inspection and supervision stickers (Editor's note: The above two kinds of goods tax systems are consistent national systems, and both have their necessity and certain functions. It is hoped that more reviews and improvements will be made in implementation.), sealing and opening, which has hindered some material exchanges. This affects the closer connection between tax work and tax personnel and the people.

    Due to the existence of the above problems, according to the instructions of Chairman Gao Gang and Vice Chairman Li Fuchun before the meeting and drawing on past experience, the meeting determined the future direction as: to implement the spirit of the Central Tax Conference, based on the specific situation in the Northeast, grasp the tax source, adjust the burden, simplify procedures, and improve the cadres' unified thinking on policy and tasks, continue to give play to the cadres' revolutionary enthusiasm and initiative, and ensure the correct implementation of the tax policy.

    In order to strive for the realization of this policy, the conference also determined: 1. To gradually realize a more reasonable burden, and in view of the fact that fully grasping tax source materials and calculating and levying taxes according to rates is the key to implementing the tax policy, it is necessary to cultivate and set up specialized statistics and planning personnel, and strengthen the systematic and comprehensive tax source investigation and statistics work; at the same time, it is also necessary to implement scientific business management with emphasis, starting from large and medium-sized cities with large tax sources and complex situations, and collect taxes according to the regulations of the Central Tax Conference, combining self-reporting, checking accounts and calculating taxes according to rates, democratic appraisal, typical investigation, and periodic fixed quota tax bureau verification. In terms of industrial and commercial management, the main tasks are to establish accounts and establish a shipping invoice system, and to strengthen the regular inspection and leadership of special zone and special cadres and industrial and commercial group leaders to prevent corruption and bribery, distortion of laws and abuse of power, and collective cover-ups. 2. Reorganize the use of forces so that they can take care of the overall situation and strengthen the main areas and departments, and equip stronger cadres to the main tax source areas and main aspects. At the same time, strengthen the ideological and political leadership of cadres, so that everything is done in accordance with policies and laws, strictly prevent various phenomena that violate policies, and correct the individual existing coercive command style. 3. Strengthen organized and planned in-depth inspection work, focusing on checking the completion of tasks, the correct implementation of policies and laws, the burden situation of industrial and commercial households, and the ideological style of cadres.

### 东北二届税务会议贯彻整风精神  检查工作确定今后方针

　　东北二届税务会议贯彻整风精神
    检查工作确定今后方针
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：于上月二十八日结束的东北第二届税务会议，以整风精神对半年来的税收工作，进行了认真的检查，并确定了今后的工作方针。
    会议认为：半年来，东北的税收工作是有成绩的，而且是主要的一面。首先是依照国家的税收政策完成了税收任务，这是使全东北财政收支趋于巩固平衡的重要条件之一，从而保证了对经济建设的投资，稳定了物价。这些成绩的获得是税收工作不断地改进与提高，以及税收工作人员积极努力的结果。其次，由于在总的方面贯彻了税收政策，因之正当的私营工商业获得了发展；特别是私营工业，以沈阳为例，根据本年四月份统计：工厂的家数比初解放时增加了百分之一百零五点六，职工增加了百分之一百一十六点六，资金从去年四月到今年四月增加了百分之一百四十点四。
    但是，半年来，也产生了不少的缺点和偏差，有的甚至还相当严重。主要的是负担不平衡，相对的畸轻畸重。这种现象不仅存在于地区之间，而且也存在于行业之间和户与户之间。产生这种现象的根源，主要原因是：一、领导上对于税源材料作有系统地全面地搜集、分析、比较，及主动地掌握不够，因此计划带有片面性，形成轻者恒轻、个别过重的现象，未能及时纠正。二、有相当数量的工商业者，至今尚对政府隐报其营业情况，政府就暂时只好采取民主评议的方式课税，以求其负担准确；但在实际执行中，由于某些工商业者不能开诚布公地进行评议，就减弱了这种方法所能达到的准确性。
    其次，领导干部对有计划地培养、教育干部、和及时深入地检查工作不够，若干工作人员在执行工作中，在作风上，政策思想上还存在着不同程度的缺点，主要的是政策观点不强，有时把任务与政策对立起来，因而产生某种脱离政策的现象。再就是态度生硬，方法简单，甚至还有个别贪污乱纪现象。如前抚顺税务局曾发现以该局局长鞠进仁为首的集体贪污案件等。另外，过去一些制度手续不够简化，特别是货票同行、查验监贴（编者按：以上二种货物税的制度，系全国一致的制度，均有其必要与一定作用，希多在执行上检讨、改进。），开封讫封，曾对某些物资交流有所妨碍。这影响到税收工作与税收人员更进一步地与人民群众取得密切联系。
    由于以上问题的存在，会议根据高岗主席、李富春副主席会前的指示和吸取以往经验，确定今后方针为：贯彻执行中央税务会议精神，根据东北具体情况，掌握税源，调整负担，简化手续，并提高干部对政策与任务的统一思想，继续发挥干部革命热情和积极性，保证正确地执行税收政策。
    为争取此一方针的实现，会议并确定：一、要逐渐实现更合理的负担，而鉴于充分掌握税源材料依率计征，是贯彻税收政策的重要关键，因此必须培养与设置专门统计、计划人员，加强有系统的全面的税源调查统计工作；同时，并有重点地实行科学的营业管理，首先由税源较大，情况复杂的大、中城市着手，按中央税务会议规定，以自报查账依率计征，民主评议典型调查和定期定额税局核定三者相结合的方法征收。在工商管理方面，主要是建账及建立发货票制度，并加强对专责区专责干部与工商小组组长经常检查工作和领导，防止贪污受贿，歪曲法令或滥用职权，集体包庇等不良现象。二、重新组织使用力量，使其既能照顾全面，又能加强主要地区和部门，将较强干部配备于主要税源地区与主要方面。同时，加强对干部的思想与政策领导，做到一切按政策法令办事，严防各种违犯政策的现象，纠正个别存在的强迫命令作风。三、加强有组织、有计划地深入检查工作，着重检查任务的完成、政策法令的正确执行、工商业户负担情况，以及干部思想作风等。
