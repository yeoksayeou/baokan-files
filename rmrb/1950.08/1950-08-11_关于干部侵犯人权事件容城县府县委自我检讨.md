　　Self-Criticism of Rongcheng County Government and County Party Committee Regarding Cadre Infringement of Human Rights

Comrade Editor:

　　After the publication of "Rongcheng County District Cadres Infringe Upon Human Rights, County Government and County Party Committee Shield and Condone" in the People's Garden on July 12th, we all made profound self-criticisms. Now we will tell you about our self-criticisms and the course of this incident.

　　The facts reported by the Baoding Prefectural Committee Correspondence Section regarding the cadres of the Fourth District hanging and beating Li Lorous are true, as is our failure to promptly address and resolve this issue. Regarding this matter, the county government and county party committee made a bureaucratic mistake. Without clarifying the situation beforehand, we made a one-sided report to the higher authorities, resulting in an unfair sentence for the perpetrators.

　　After the incident of hanging and beating Li Lorous occurred, the Public Security Bureau first conducted an investigation. Later, the Organization Minister of the County Party Committee summoned the cadres of the district to testify and conduct a self-criticism on the incident. However, the true situation was not clarified (especially by the court). We not only did not go to the scene to understand the situation, but also did not talk face-to-face with the Organization Minister and the Public Security Bureau, and only made subjective judgments based on the Public Security Bureau's report over the phone, mistakenly pushing the responsibility onto Liu Yingjie (District Education Assistant). The Prefectural Committee then decided to expel Liu Yingjie from the Party based on the county's report, and the Baoding Branch ordered the removal of Liu Yingjie from his post and to be dealt with according to the law, while the perpetrator Wang Zhenfang was only allowed to conduct self-criticism and reflection, and given criticism and education. As the higher authorities did not receive the true situation from us regarding District Committee Secretary Song Chunfang and Construction Section Chief Ren Shuhua, they did not receive any punishment. At the time, we believed that this handling was inappropriate, so we sent Dong Zhong, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the County Party Committee, to conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the facts of the hanging and beating. Based on the facts investigated by Dong, he proposed a punishment opinion: in addition to immediately arresting the principal offender Wang Zhenfang, Deputy Minister Dong Zhong would be sent to the Prefectural Committee to report the situation and propose handling opinions. After listening to the report, Section Chief Bai of the Organization Department of the Prefectural Committee replied that he would reply by letter after the Prefectural Committee studied the matter. In this way, the county government did not detain Liu Yingjie in a timely manner according to the decision of the higher authorities. As a result, the Prefectural Committee only urged for a report on the situation and did not reply on how to deal with it. We waited for instructions from above and did not take action. The Branch did not summon the cadres who infringed on human rights until April 14th.

　　Our self-criticism on this matter: First, we did not have a sufficient understanding of the policy of guaranteeing human rights and the spirit of the rule of law. Therefore, we did not pay enough attention to the incident of infringement of human rights, which seriously damaged the prestige of the Party and the people's government. This irresponsible attitude towards the people is a serious manifestation of bureaucracy. When the cadres who infringed on human rights expressed their apologies to Li Lorous at the mass meeting in Wang Village (the village where Li Lorous, who was beaten, lived), the county government and the court did not send anyone to participate and listen to the opinions of the masses of the village and Li Lorous. This was obviously also wrong.

　　Secondly, we adopted a shielding and condoning attitude towards the cadres who infringed upon human rights, only giving them Party disciplinary actions and not executing the sentences of the higher authorities. As a result, criminals such as Liu Yingjie remained at large for a time.

　　This incident of hanging and beating Li Lorous gave us a profound education. We will remember this lesson and use it as a guideline for improving our work in the future. In addition to making a public self-criticism to the county and district cadres, the county party committee and county government will also conduct education among cadres at all levels to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again in the future.

### 关于干部侵犯人权事件容城县府县委自我检讨

　　关于干部侵犯人权事件容城县府县委自我检讨编者同志：
    人民园地七月十二日刊登《容城县区干部侵犯人权，县府县委包庇，姑息》一文后，我们均作了深刻的检讨，今将我们的检讨及此一事件的经过告诉你们。
    保定地委通讯科所报道的四区干部吊打李洛肉的事实经过，与我们未抓紧处理解决这一问题是真实的。对于这件事情，县府、县委犯了官僚主义的错误，事先未弄清情况，就片面的报告上级，致使上级对犯罪人的判处不够公平。
    吊打李洛肉的事件发生后，先由公安局进行了了解，后由县委组织部长召集该区干部对该事件作了对证并进行了检讨。但对真实情况是没有弄清的，（尤以法院更为严重），我们不但没到现场去了解，也没找组织部长与公安局人员进行面谈，只是在电话上听了公安局的报告，就主观地作了判断，错误地把责任推在刘英杰（区教育助理员）身上。地委遂根据县方的报告，决定开除刘英杰的党籍，保定分院并复示将刘英杰撤职法办，而肇祸人王振芳仅让其检讨反省，给以批评教育。对区委宋春芳、建设科长任树华，上级因未接到我们的真实情况，则未受到任何处分。当时，我们认为这样处理是不妥当的，遂派县委组织部副部长董忠同志作深入了解，对证吊打情况。并根据董所调查的事实提出处分意见：除立即将主犯王振芳逮捕外，再派副部长董忠亲到地委汇报情况与提出处理意见。地委组织部白科长听取汇报后，答复待地委研究后再函复。这样，县府就未及时按上级决定将刘英杰拘押。结果地委只是催报情况，而未复示如何处理。我们也就等待上面的指示，未作处理。四月十四日分院才先后传讯侵犯人权的干部。
    我们对此事的检讨：首先，我们对保证人权政策与法治精神体会不够，因而对严重损害党与人民政府威信的侵犯人权事件未予重视。这种对人民不负责任的态度是严重的官僚主义的表现。当侵犯人权的干部在王村（被吊打者李洛肉所住的村子）群众大会上向李洛肉表示道歉时，县府与法院也未派人去参加，听取该村群众及李洛肉的意见。这显然也是错误的。
    其次，我们对侵犯人权的干部采取包庇姑息的态度，只给予党纪处分，没有按上级的判处执行。因而使刘英杰等罪犯一时逍遥法外。
    此次吊打李洛肉事件，给了我们一个深刻教育。我们将牢记这个教训，作为今后改进工作的指针。县委县府除向县、区干部作公开检讨外，并将在各级干部中进行教育，保证以后不再发生类似事件。
