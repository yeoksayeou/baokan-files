　　The push-pull numbering machine that the Beijing People's Printing Factory is about to adopt is made entirely from old machine parts and waste materials. This new contribution greatly improves printing efficiency. The creator is Jiao Changhai, a veteran technician at the factory.
　　Jiao Changhai is a skilled machine repairman with over forty years of work experience. However, after Liberation, the numbering machines used in the factory caused him a lot of headaches. Foreign-made ones were difficult to buy, and those made in Shanghai often broke down. The number of workers specializing in repairing numbering machines increased from one to twelve, but they were still overwhelmed.
　　"If they keep breaking down, it's no joke," Jiao Changhai thought. "We can't let foreign goods hold us back!" He planned to make one himself, making it sturdy and cost-effective. However, the factory had no tools or materials for manufacturing numbering machines.
　　Jiao Changhai did not lose heart in the face of these difficulties. He believed, "Workers are masters now, so we must have drive. If there are difficulties, we overcome them. If there are no tools, we create them!" So he began to study what tools were needed to make a numbering machine. He moved old machines that had been unused for years from the warehouse and found some discarded iron parts in the scrap metal pile. After careful research and modification, he made more than twenty essential tools for making numbering machines. He also collected used saw blades as materials for manufacturing numbering machines. Soon, brand-new, durable numbering machines were born from Jiao Changhai's arduous efforts. Now, except for the number wheels, which cannot yet be made in-house, the other thirteen parts can be made from waste materials, and the quality is no worse than that of foreign goods.
　　During the manufacturing process, Jiao Changhai also created the push-pull numbering machine. This is a new contribution to China's printing industry. The numbering machines used in the past were pressure-type. During printing, not only was typesetting very troublesome, but the rubber rollers also had to be cut section by section, which was time-consuming and laborious, greatly affecting printing efficiency. Jiao Changhai had long noticed this situation, but he didn't say a word before Liberation. Decades of experience made this veteran technician realize the true face of the reactionaries. Therefore, at that time, Jiao Changhai made up his mind that no matter what skills he had, he would not sell them to the reactionaries. But after Liberation, things were different. Jiao Changhai understood that he was now working for himself. Therefore, after successfully creating the tools for manufacturing numbering machines, he used his wisdom to create the push-pull numbering machine. This new type of numbering machine does not use pressure, but uses vertical and horizontal steel bars and screws to connect more than twenty numbering machines on one plate, using dragging force to jump the number codes. During printing, the distance can be adjusted at will, eliminating the need to cut rubber rollers and avoiding the trouble of typesetting, saving both time and effort.
　　Jiao Changhai is a very kind and amiable veteran technician, now sixty-two years old. He can be said to be a pioneer in the People's Printing Factory. He joined the factory in the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the factory was called the "Ministry of Revenue Printing Bureau." According to him, the building he now works in had not yet been built. At the age of nineteen, Jiao Changhai started working on machines in the factory. From the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, the Japanese invaders, to the Kuomintang era, he suffered the exploitation and oppression of the reactionaries. He recalled the past, saying, "They only pulled you when they needed you, and when they didn't need you, they kicked you out. Every factory director, when they first came, would try to win over the workers, but once they had earned enough money for their masters, they would find ways to control you." Like other workers, Jiao Changhai was often subjected to wage deductions and layoffs for forty years. His family of seven or eight often went hungry and cold as a result. It was not until after Liberation that Jiao Changhai truly stood up. Although his hair is now gray, his vigorous spirit at work is no less than that of a young man. He loves to mentor apprentices and has already taught more than a dozen, and among them, Wei Jianlin and Zhao Xiushan have become very outstanding workers. He often says, "I can't work for many more years! This job will eventually belong to the young people, won't it?"
　　Now, Jiao Changhai is not only a technician at the China People's Printing Factory, but also a member of the factory's management committee. Because he has the advanced consciousness of the working class, he was also elected as a member of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions in February of this year.

　　焦常海和推拉式号码机

    北京市中国人民印刷厂即将采用的推拉式号码机，从工具到材料，都是利用旧机件和废材料自造的。这个新的贡献，大大的提高了印刷的效率。创造者是该厂的老技工焦常海。
    焦常海是个修理机器的能手，有四十多年的工作经验。但在解放后，厂子里所使用的号码机，却使他伤了脑筋；外国货不易买，上海造的又时常坏。专门修理号码机的工人，从他一个人增加到十二个人，还是忙不过来。
    “老坏下去，可不是闹着玩的。”焦常海心里想：“不能叫外国货给别住了呀！”他计划着自己动手做，既要做得坚实，还要能省钱，可是一切制造号码机用的工具、材料，厂子里都没有。
    焦常海在这样困难的条件下，并没有低头丧气。他认为：“工人当了家就得有个劲头，有困难，就克服，没工具，创造嘛！”于是他便开始研究制造号码机需要些什么工具，于是到仓库里搬出了多年不用的旧机器，在废铁堆里找出些用废了的铁活，经过他细心钻研改造之后，制成了二十多件造号码机不可缺少的工具。他又搜集了别人用过了的废锯条，作为制造号码机的材料。不久崭新耐用的号码机，就在焦常海这样艰苦的创造下诞生了。现在，除了号码机上的字轮尚不能自造外，其他十三个零件，都可以利用废料自造，而且质量并不比外国货差。
    在制造号码机的过程中，焦常海又创造了推拉式号码机。这在我国印刷事业上是个新的贡献。过去所用的号码机是压力式，印刷时，不但排起版来很麻烦，而且还得将胶滚割得一节一节的，又费时又费事，大大影响了印刷效率。这种情形，早就被焦常海看在眼里，但在解放前他就没有吭一声。几十年的体验，使这位老技工认识了反动派的真面目。所以在那时，焦常海就打定了主意，不管有什么本领，也不卖给反动派。可是解放后就不同了，焦常海明白现在是给自己做工。因此，他在制造号码机的工具成功以后，又以他的智慧，创造了推拉式号码机。这个新型的号码机，不用压力，而是用纵横的钢条和螺丝，将二十多个号码机连结在一块版上，以拖拉力量跳动字码。印刷时且可随意伸缩距离，不但不要割胶滚，而且又免去了排版的麻烦，既省时又省事。
    焦常海是一位非常和蔼可亲的老技工，今年六十二岁了。在人民印刷厂里，可以说是开天辟地的元老。他进厂那年，还是在满清宣统年间，当时的厂名叫“度支部印刷局”。据他说：现在他在里面工作的大楼，那时还没有盖起来。十九岁的焦常海，在厂子里开头干的就是机器活。从满清、北洋军阀、日寇、一直到国民党时代，反动派对工人们的剥削和压迫，他都遭受到了。他回忆过去的情形说：“那才真是用时拉一把，不用时就去你的。历来的厂长们，刚来时那个不先向工人买好，等待给他们的主人赚足了钱，就该想法治你了。”焦常海和其他的工人一样，四十年来经常受着克扣工资和裁员的压迫。一家七、八口人，常常因此吃不饱、穿不暖。直到解放后，焦常海才真正翻了身，别看他现在已经须发斑白，可是在工作中生气勃勃的气概，并不减于年青的小伙子。他很爱带徒弟，已经教出了十几个，而且其中的魏建林、赵秀山，还成了很出色的工人。他常说：“我干不了多少年了！这份活，将来还不是他们年青人的？”
    现在的焦常海，不光是中国人民印刷厂的技佐，而且还是该厂管委会的委员，由于他有了工人阶级先进的觉悟，在今年二月，又当选了北京市总工会的委员。
