Launch a Mass Seed Selection Campaign
　　Zhang Linchi

Doing a good job in seed selection can ensure the improvement of crop quality and the increase of yield, reduce the invasion of pests and diseases and other natural disasters, and stabilize harvests. At the same time, careful seed selection can obtain seeds that grow under the same natural conditions, providing many conveniences for crop cultivation management and harvesting. The mass seed selection campaign relies on the wisdom and experience of the masses to select varieties and sound seeds that meet our requirements, which is an important part of improving agricultural production.

I. The seed selection campaign is a comprehensive and mass-based technical improvement movement, and it is a complex and meticulous organizational task. To carry out this work, we should mobilize and gather forces from all sides. Agricultural administrative and technical cadres at all levels, professional institutions, rural cadres, model laborers, and activists should be closely organized and work in conjunction with specific technical guidance. In order to enable the broad masses to master proficient seed selection techniques, training classes should be established in counties and districts to promote mass-based seed selection education.

II. In areas with better conditions and a foundation for seed selection work, the county should convene production assistants from various districts, production committee members from various villages, leaders of technical groups, production experts, and activists to discuss seed selection and variety replacement, form a seed evaluation committee, collect excellent seeds within the county, and evaluate them to determine their promotional value and discuss promotional methods. Farmers who cultivate excellent seeds should be rated and rewarded.

III. In areas where the masses have no understanding of seed selection work, various gatherings should be combined, and various methods should be used to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity. Technical cadres should be organized to go to the countryside to provide practical guidance to farmers in seed selection, to make typical demonstrations, and to make the masses aware of the benefits of seed selection. Model laborers and activists should be mobilized as the core to promote seed selection work.

IV. Establish a breeding promotion and reward system: formulate various reward methods, distribute them to various places, and launch extensive publicity to set off a mass seed selection boom. Organized seed selection work should be carried out. Farmers who have made achievements in seed selection work should be commended and materially rewarded, and cotton and grain purchasing agencies should be required to implement the policy of "good cotton, good price, good grain, good price" so that the masses can recognize the benefits of seed selection and create favorable conditions for carrying out the seed selection campaign.

　　开展群众选种运动
    张林池
    做好选种工作，能保证作物品质的提高和产量的增加，也能减少病虫害及其他自然灾害的侵袭，稳定收成。同时精细的选种，能选得在同样自然条件下生长的种子，给与作物的栽培管理与收获上以许多便利。群众性的选种运动，是依靠群众的智慧和经验，选择适应我们要求的品种及健全的种子，是提高农业生产的重要一环。
    一、选种运动是全面性、群众性的技术改良运动，是繁杂而又精细的组织工作。进行此工作应该动员并集结各方面的力量。各级农业行政及技术干部，专业机构及农村干部，劳动模范，积极分子都应紧密地组织起来，结合具体的技术指导进行工作。为要使广大群众掌握熟练的选种技术，应在县区设立训练班，推广群众性的选种教育。
    二、在条件较好，选种工作有基础的地区，应由县召集各区生产助理员、各村生产委员、技术小组长、生产能手及积极分子研讨选种换种，组成种子评选委员会，搜集县内优良种子，加以评选，以确定其有无推广价值及商定推广方法。对育成优良种子的农民，应评定等级予以奖励。
    三、在群众对选种工作没有认识的地区，要结合各种集会，利用各种方式，展开广泛而深入的宣传，并要组织技术干部下乡，实际指导农民选种，做典型示范，使群众认识选种的好处。发动劳模和积极分子作核心，以推动选种工作。
    四、要建立繁殖推广奖励制度：制定各种奖励办法，分发各地，展开广泛的宣传，以掀起群众的选种热潮。有组织的进行选种工作，对选种工作有成绩的农民应该予以表扬和物质的奖励，并要求棉粮收购机构贯彻好棉好价，好粮好价的政策，以使群众认识到选种的利益，为开展选种运动造成有利条件。
