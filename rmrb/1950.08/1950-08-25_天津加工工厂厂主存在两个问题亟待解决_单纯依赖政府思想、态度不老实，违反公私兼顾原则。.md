Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 23rd: Private factories in Tianjin continue to receive assistance from state-owned enterprises in the form of commissioned processing, orders, and purchases. In June and July, 688 private factories in industries such as weaving and dyeing, rubber, hardware, machinery, egg products, and flour received assistance from the North China Branch of the China National Sundries Corporation, the North China Branch of the China National Grain Corporation, the North China Branch of the China National Oils and Fats Corporation, the China National Egg Products Corporation, and the Tianjin Trust Company. According to incomplete statistics, the procurement, order, and processing fees paid by the Sundries, Trust, and Egg Products companies alone amounted to over 83.8 billion yuan. Many private factories that received assistance have maintained production, and some have even obtained certain profits. For example, the Lixing Egg Factory, which processed eggs for the Egg Products Company, earned more than 1.1 billion yuan from March to July.

Currently, there are two urgent problems among the aforementioned factory owners who accept processing, orders, and purchases: One is the mentality of purely relying on the government. Many factory owners demand that the Sundries Corporation purchase their accumulated slow-moving and substandard goods, or purchase their products in unlimited quantities. This kind of demand is not in line with the principle of considering both public and private interests, because the funds of the Sundries Corporation are limited. During the most difficult period for industry and commerce this year, the company purchased some slow-moving and substandard goods to help some private factories overcome their difficulties. From April to the end of July, this had already accumulated 229.7 billion yuan in capital, exceeding the company's stipulated working capital by nearly two times. If capital continues to be tied up, it will not only cause more losses to the state but also make it more difficult for private factories because no one will purchase their saleable goods. The other problem to be solved is that some factory owners are dishonest and cut corners or even engage in speculation when accepting orders or processing. The China National Egg Products Corporation discovered that more than 1,000 boxes of egg products delivered by the Hebei Egg Factory were short by half a pound per box, and later another 300 boxes were substandard. The private Tianjin Oil Factory, since it started processing for the Oils and Fats Company in June last year, had secretly sold over 120,000 jin of flax by-products and over 100 barrels of flax oil stored by the company in the factory by April this year, using the proceeds as speculative capital. As a result, the factory has suffered the consequences. It not only had to compensate the Oils and Fats Company but was also disqualified from processing by the company.

　　天津加工工厂厂主存在两个问题亟待解决
    单纯依赖政府思想、态度不老实，违反公私兼顾原则。
    【新华社天津二十三日电】天津市私营工厂继续得到公营企业的委托加工、定货和收购的扶助。在六、七两个月内，得到中国百货公司华北区公司、中国粮食公司华北区公司、中国油脂公司华北区公司、中国蛋品公司、天津市信托公司扶助的私营工厂有织染、橡胶、五金、机器、蛋品、面粉等行业共六百八十八家。据不完全统计，仅百货、信托、蛋品三公司付出的收购、定货和加工费等款就有八百三十八亿余元。许多得到扶助的私营工厂都维持了生产，有的还获得了一定的利润。如为蛋品公司加工的利兴蛋厂，自三月到七月，共获利十一亿余元。
    目前，在上述接受加工、定货和收购的厂主中存在两个亟需解决的问题：一是单纯依赖政府的思想。许多厂主要求百货公司收购该厂所积存的冷货和次货，或无限量地收购其产品。这种要求是不符合于公私兼顾的原则的。因为百货公司的资金是有限的。在今年工商业最困难时期，该公司为了帮助某些私营工厂度过困难，曾收购了一些冷货和次货，自四月至七月底已积压了资金达二千二百九十七亿余元，超过该公司规定周转资金将近二倍。如果再继续积压资金，则不仅将使国家受到更多的损失，而且也将使私营工厂因为可销货品无人收购而更加困难。另一个待解决问题是某些厂主态度不老实，在接受定货或加工中偷工减料甚至投机捣把。中国蛋品公司曾发现河北蛋厂所交千余箱蛋品，每箱少半磅，其后又有三百余箱不合规格。私营天津油厂，自去年六月开始为油脂公司加工以来，至今年四月，曾先后盗卖公司在该厂存放之胡麻下身十二万余斤和胡麻油百余桶，把售款去作投机资本。结果该厂已自食其恶果。它不但不得不对油脂公司作了赔偿，而且被公司取消了加工的资格。
