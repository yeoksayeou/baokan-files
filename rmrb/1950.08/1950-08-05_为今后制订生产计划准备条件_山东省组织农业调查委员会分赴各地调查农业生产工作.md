　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 31st: The Shandong Provincial People's Government has decided to conduct an unprecedented agricultural production survey throughout the province from July to September this year, as a basis for formulating a provincial agricultural production plan in the future. The Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry, Department of Civil Affairs, and other units have formed the Provincial Agricultural Survey Committee, with Wang Tao, Deputy Director of the Department of Industry, as Chairman, and Liu Shichao, Professor of Nanjing University, as Vice Chairman. Under the committee is the Agricultural Survey Team, with over 500 participants, including professors and students from National Nanjing University, National Anhui University, National Shandong University, Jinling University, Qilu University, Shandong Provincial Agricultural College, and cadres drawn from government agencies. The survey team departed for various locations on July 23rd. The main content of the Agricultural Survey Team's investigation is the change in crop yields before and after the Anti-Japanese War, as well as related changes in population, labor force, livestock, agricultural implements, and plowing, weeding, fertilization, women's labor, sideline production, and other conditions. The survey types are divided into general surveys, typical surveys, and universal surveys. The general surveys require in-depth investigations at the county and district levels to accurately revise existing survey figures based on the survey results. Typical survey areas have been determined as 16 counties, including Huimin, Laiwu, Linyi, Laiyang, and Wendeng, with two or three villages selected in each county as survey base points to understand rural economic development. It was also decided to conduct a comprehensive survey of population, labor, livestock, crop area and yield, wasteland, and forest land in Linyi County.
