　　Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Materials Department Irresponsible Procurement Leads to Serious Waste

　　[Our Zhengzhou Correspondent] The Zhengzhou Railway Administration's Materials Department exhibits serious waste. During the major reinforcement project of the Yellow River Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the more than 7,000 kilograms of rivets purchased by the Materials Department all had small heads and thick tails, requiring modification before use, wasting a great deal of manpower. On July 8th, the Materials Department transported four train cars of bricks, a total of 1,200 tons, from Zhengzhou to the Kaifeng Repair Factory. The material was poor, and the dimensions did not meet standards. Upon arrival, one-third of the bricks were half-bricks or had turned into brick fragments. Several train cars of lime transported by the department from Luoyang to the Xinyang Works Section were returned because they had already turned into lime powder and could not be used. If they had been purchased locally, it would have saved time and transportation costs.

　　In April, May and June, the red lead and red and black lead oil used for bridge and culvert maintenance by the Zhengzhou Bureau and the red and black lead oil used for engineering projects were completely unusable due to poor quality. The oil quality and oiliness of the lead oil had changed. Some of it was as dry as if it had been mixed with coal ash, and some of it was as thin as if it had been mixed with water. The lead powder was coarse and could not be used. The Works Department requested the return of a total of 5,880 kilograms of lead oil and lead powder, worth approximately 30 million yuan. The road maintenance tools distributed by the Works Department to each section throughout the year exceeded the budget due to their poor quality. For example, the annual budget for picks for the entire railway bureau was 6,000, but within the Zhengzhou General Bureau area alone, 7,110 picks were used in excess of the plan in half a year, because the purchased picks were all made of cast iron and broke with a single dig; some of them were simply bad picks coated with a layer of black oil. Examples of such consumption are quite numerous. This fully illustrates the irresponsibility of the material procurement personnel.

　　郑州路局材料处采购不负责
    造成严重浪费现象
    【本报郑州讯】郑州铁路管理局材料处，存在着严重的浪费现象。在京汉路黄河桥大加固工程中，材料处代购的七千多公斤铆钉，都是头小尾粗，必需经过改制以后才能使用，浪费人力甚多。七月八日，材料处从郑州运到开封修配厂四个车皮的砖，共一千二百吨，质料坏，尺寸不合标准，运到后，有三分之一的砖是半截的或是变成了砖块。该处从洛阳运到信阳工务段的几车皮石灰，因为已经变成了灰粉，不能使用，又退了回去。如果就地采购，不但可以经济时间，而且还可以节省运费。
    四、五、六月份，郑州局桥涵维修用的红灰铅粉和工程用的红黑铅油，都因质料不好，完全不能使用。铅油的油质油性已起了变化，其中干的像掺了煤灰，稀的像掺了水，铅粉的质粗，都不能使用。工务处要求退回的铅油和铅粉共达五千八百八十公斤，共值三千万元左右。工务处全年配给各段的养路工具，都因质料不好而超出了预算。如全年全路局预算的洋镐为六千把，仅郑州总局区内半年就超计划用了七千一百一十把，因所购洋镐都是生铁，一扎就断了；其中有一部分还是仅涂上一层黑油的坏洋镐。像这样消费的例子相当不少。这充分说明了材料采购人员的不负责任。
