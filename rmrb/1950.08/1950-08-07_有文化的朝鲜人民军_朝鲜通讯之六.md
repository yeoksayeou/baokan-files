　　The Cultured Korean People's Army – Korean Dispatch Six
　　By Our Special Correspondent in the Korean War Zone, Li Zhuang
　　It is relatively easy for Chinese journalists to understand the Korean People's Army. They possess the deep and simple character unique to Orientals; they are young, healthy, cheerful, and confident. They are just as lovable as the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　In Sinuiju, the car we rode in was driven by a soldier of the People's Army. During breaks from his work, he often leaned on the steering wheel and quietly read "Literature and Art" – the official magazine of the North Korean Federation of Literature and Art, one of Korea's most famous high-level literary and artistic magazines. At the time, I thought: the People's Army seems to be full of educated people. This impression was later confirmed by countless facts. In Seoul, I had a written conversation with six soldiers of the People's Army for an hour. There was no translator at the time, and we did not speak the same language. However, a kind of internationalist, cordial, and sincere feeling was connected through Chinese characters. They could write fluent Chinese characters. From the written conversation, it could be seen that they clearly understood why they were fighting, recognized the justice of the war, and had firm confidence in victory. Of these six soldiers, four were workers and two were peasants. They were very concerned about the situation in China, and they wrote on paper: "Say hello to Chairman Mao!" A strong heat flowed through my whole body. I quickly wrote: "Chairman Mao is very well. Thank you! Best wishes to General Kim Il-sung!" They all smiled. In Korea, I kept hearing greetings to Chairman Mao. On the Han River Bridge (south of Seoul), which was destroyed by enemy planes, a captain and a soldier of the People's Army said to me in Chinese: "Comrade, you've worked hard." I felt a special warmth and quickly said: "Comrade, hello!" When they learned that I was from Beijing, they immediately asked: "How is Chairman Mao?" "We miss him very much!"

　　Amidst the roar of American planes, I talked with thirty-six soldiers of a certain regiment of the People's Army for three hours. They looked calm and talked and laughed freely. This small unit had been defending the former "38th parallel" for three years. The soldiers said: "We were often attacked in the past. Everyone was angered by them (referring to the puppet army)." Eleven of these thirty-six soldiers were "Heroes of Jungbosan." Jungbosan is located north of the "38th parallel," 280-odd meters above sea level, and was constantly attacked by the puppet army. There is a popular Korean opera called "Jungbosan," which specifically describes the glorious achievements of the People's Army in defending this mountain. The soldiers especially introduced the battle to defend Jungbosan in October of last year, which was one of many defensive battles. This battle started on October 14th and ended on October 16th. The enemy was the ferocious 18th Regiment of the 1st Division of the Li Seung-man puppet army – known as the "White Tiger Unit," totaling more than 2,000 people. As a result of three days of fighting, the invading army was completely annihilated. On a high ground, six soldiers of the People's Army were attacked by a company of the puppet army. The puppet army charged thirty-seven times, but were all repelled. Five of the six People's Army soldiers were killed in the first two days of fighting. Machine gunner Li Rong-xie persisted until the last day of the battle, eliminating a company of invading troops, and gloriously sacrificed himself. During our conversation, every soldier showed infinite nostalgia for this Korean hero. This regiment of the People's Army was awarded five National Flag Medals, two Merit Medals, and one hundred and fifty Military Service Medals for their meritorious service in repelling the reactionary invaders. On June 25th of this year, the enemy again invaded north of the "38th parallel." The People's Army could no longer tolerate it and began to counterattack. These thirty-six soldiers fought all the way from the "38th parallel" to Seoul.

　　These thirty-six soldiers were all educated and lovable young people, including four workers and thirty-two poor peasants. Five were eighteen years old, six were twenty years old, seven were twenty-one years old, eight were twenty-three years old, nine were twenty-five years old, and only one was twenty-seven years old. They could all read newspapers. Five of them were illiterate when they enlisted, but they quickly learned in the army. The People's Army used its greatest efforts to eliminate illiteracy, forming mutual aid groups of three people, with the literate teaching the illiterate. Some illiterate soldiers could read newspapers after studying for three months. In peacetime, soldiers spent six hours a day in military training, two hours in political classes, and the rest of the time in cultural entertainment and literacy. Shelters and artillery positions became places of learning. Examinations were held every spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Twelve of these thirty-six soldiers had won the "Victory Flag" in their studies. According to the soldiers, every squad (platoon) had a wall newspaper, and every company (company) had an army library with hundreds of books. In addition to political books, the soldiers' favorite genres were novels and poetry.

　　These soldiers were very healthy. I have seen their supply standards, and each person could receive the following items every day: one kilogram of rice, twenty grams of sugar, twenty grams of cooking oil, one hundred grams of beef, two hundred grams of sea fish, six hundred grams of vegetables, three grams of soy sauce, thirty grams of salt, twenty grams of vinegar, and twenty cigarettes. The soldiers' minds were even healthier than their bodies. They said: "We don't want to fight." Indeed, workers who have gained labor protection and peasants who have been given land are willing to engage in peaceful labor. However, they said: "The Americans and Li Seung-man are attacking us, and we can only drive them out. If we don't drive them away, we will have to live the life before 'August 15th' again. That life was not fit for humans."

　　有文化的朝鲜人民军  朝鲜通讯之六
    本报朝鲜战地特派记者  李庄
    中国记者了解朝鲜人民军，是比较容易的。他们具有东方人特有的深沉、朴素的性格；他们年青、健康、愉快、有信心。他们就象中国人民解放军一样的可爱。
    在新义州，我们乘坐的汽车，由一位人民军的士兵驾驶着。他在工作的间隙中，常常依托着汽车的方向盘，静静地读“文学与艺术”——这是北朝鲜文学艺术总同盟的机关杂志，是朝鲜最有名的高级文艺杂志之一。当时我想：人民军似乎都是有教养的人。这种印象，后来被无数的事实证明了。在汉城，我和六位人民军的士兵作了一小时的笔谈。当时没有翻译，我们不通语言。但是，一种国际主义的亲切、真诚的情感，用汉字连系起来了。他们能写得一笔流利的汉字。从笔谈中，可以看出他们清楚的懂得自己为什么要作战，认识战争的正义性，以及具有坚定的胜利信心。这六个战士，有四个工人，两个农民。他们非常关心中国的情形，他们在纸上写：“问毛主席好！”一种强烈的热力流贯我的全身。我连忙写：“毛主席很好。谢谢！金日成将军好！”他们都笑了。在朝鲜，我不断听到问候毛主席的声音。在被敌机炸坏的汉江大铁桥上（在汉城市以南），人民军一位上尉，一位士兵用中国话对我说：“同志，辛苦了。”我感到一种特别的亲切，连忙说：“同志，你好！”当他们晓得了我是从北京来的，立刻就问：“毛主席好！”“我们非常想他！”
    在美国飞机的隆隆声中，我和人民军某联队三十六个战士谈了三小时。他们神色安然，谈笑自若。这个为数不大的部队，在前“三八线”上防守了三年。战士们说：“我们过去常常被攻击。每个人都被他们（指傀儡军）气坏了。”这三十六个战士中，有十一位是“钲坡山的英雄”。钲坡山在“三八线”北，拔海二百八十余米，不断遭受傀儡军的攻击。朝鲜有一出流行的名叫“钲坡山”的歌剧，专门描写人民军保卫此山的光荣业迹。战士们特别介绍了去年十月间保卫钲坡山战斗的情况，这是许多次保卫战中的一次。这次战斗从十月十四日开始，十月十六日结束。敌人是凶狠的李承晚傀儡军第一师团第十八联队——号称“白虎部队”，共两千余人。三天战斗的结果，进犯军被全部歼灭了。在一个高地上，人民军六名战士遭受伪军一个中队的进攻，伪军冲锋三十七次，全被击退。六个人民军战士，在前两天战斗中牺牲了五个人。机枪射手李溶燮坚持到战斗的最后一天，他歼灭了一个中队的进犯军，自己也光荣牺牲了。我们谈话时，每一个战士都对这位朝鲜英雄，表现了无限怀念的神情。这一联队人民军，因打退反动派的进犯有功，得国旗勋章者五名，得荣誉勋章者二名，得军功勋章者一百五十名。今年六月二十五日，敌人又攻入“三八线”北，人民军实在忍无可忍，开始迎击并且反攻。这三十六名战士，一直从“三八线”打到汉城。
    这三十六名战士，都是有教养的、可爱的青年人，其中有四个工人，三十二个贫农。年龄十八岁者五人，二十岁者六人，二十一岁者七人，二十三岁者八人，二十五岁者九人，二十七岁者只有一人。他们都能看报。有五个人在入伍时不识字，但在部队中迅速学会了。人民军用最大的力量消灭文盲，编成三个人的互助小组，由识字的教不识字的。有些不识字的战士，学习三个月就能读报了。在平时，战士们每天军事训练六小时，上政治课二小时，其余时间，进行文化娱乐和识字。避弹壕中，炮火旁边，都成为学习的场所。每年春夏秋冬四季，分别举行考试。这三十六名战士中，有十二名得过学习上的“胜利之旗”。据战士们说，每个小队（排）都有壁报，每个中队（连）都有随军图书馆，收藏几百本书。除了政治书籍以外，战士们最喜爱小说和诗歌。
    这些战士都很健康，我看过他们的供给标准，每人每日可以得到下列物品：大米一千克，沙糖二十克，食油二十克，牛肉一百克，海鱼二百克，蔬菜六百克，酱油三克，食盐三十克，醋二十克，纸烟二十枝。战士们的思想比他们的身体还要健康。他们说：“我们并不想打仗。”真的，获得劳动保护的工人和分得土地的农民，是愿意从事和平劳动的。但是，他们说：“美国人和李承晚进攻我们，我们只能把它打出去。不打走它们，我们又要过“八·一五”以前的生活了。那生活不是人过的。”
