　　Beijing Native Produce Company
    Jointly Purchases Native Products with Private Merchants
    Focusing on Regulating Long-Distance, Large-Volume Native Products
    [This newspaper reports] According to the Beijing News Agency: The Beijing Branch of the China Native Produce Company, in conjunction with private merchants, has purchased local native products, which has played a significant role in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and improving public-private relations.

    In April of this year, the National Native Produce Conference decided on the business of the Beijing Native Produce Branch. It shifted from exclusively purchasing native products for export to focusing on purchasing and regulating native products from various regions. Based on this decision, the company took the initiative to contact private merchants, using methods such as commissioned sales and sales on credit to solve the financial difficulties of some private merchants and allow them to obtain appropriate profits to promote the sale of native products from other regions. For example, more than 40,000 grass mats from Zhejiang were mostly wholesaled to private merchants, in addition to a portion being sold on consignment by the Beijing Department Store Company. The sales locations outside the city reached as far as Tangshan and Baoding. The Beijing Native Produce Branch transported more than 20,000 jin of fresh ginger from Tai'an, Shandong, which was urgently needed for promotion, and sold it through private ginger shops on an installment plan. Pig oil from the Northeast was tested by the soap industry as a soap raw material. The price was lower than beef tallow, sales were rapid, and it was already in short supply. In addition, the company and 30 dried and fresh fruit merchants in Beijing organized a joint venture, signing a contract to purchase fruit in Guangzhou. The contract stipulated that the Guangzhou Native Produce Company would advance funds for the purchase, and the Beijing Dried and Fresh Fruit Joint Venture would send people to receive the goods, pack them, and transport them. The price was controlled by the Beijing Native Produce Company. This not only solved the financial difficulties of private merchants but also solved the technical difficulties of the native produce company. At the same time, the vermicelli purchased by the company in Beijing was also shipped to Guangzhou in large quantities and sold very well.

    This operating method of the Beijing Native Produce Branch not only promoted the sale of native products that farmers in various regions had been unable to sell for many years and supplied some industrial raw materials and daily necessities needed by the city but also changed the phenomena of insufficient capital and sluggish business of private merchants and the losses of the native produce company itself. At the same time, the company focused on managing the regulation of long-distance, large-volume native products that private merchants could not handle, which is beneficial to all aspects of connecting urban and rural trade, promoting the exchange of materials, and improving public-private relations. This experience is worth promoting.

　　京市土产公司
    联合私商收购土产
    着重经营远地大宗土产调剂
    【本报讯】京市新闻处讯：中国土产公司北京分公司，联合私商，收购各地土产品，对促进城乡物资交流，改进公私关系等方面起了很大作用。
    今年四月全国土产会议中，决定了北京土产分公司的业务。由专收购出口土产品转为以收购并调剂各地土产品为重点，该公司即根据这一决定，主动联络私商，用委托代销及赊销等方式，解决部分私商资金缺乏的困难，并使其获得适当利润，来推销外地土产品。例如浙江来的四万多领草席，除由北京百货分公司代销一部分外，大部批发给私商，市外转销地点远达唐山、保定等地。迫切要求推销的山东泰安鲜姜，京市土产分公司运来两万多斤，以分期付款方式，通过私营姜店销售。东北来的猪油，经肥皂业试用作肥皂原料，价格比牛油低，销售很快，并已感到供不应求。此外，该公司并和京市三十家干鲜果商组织联营社，订立了到广州采购水果的合同，合同规定由广州土产公司垫款代购，北京干鲜果联营社派人收货、装箱、起运，价格由京土产公司掌握。既解决了私商缺乏资金的困难，也解决了土产公司在技术上的困难。同时，该公司在京收购的粉丝，也大批运往广州，销路极好。
    北京土产分公司这种经营方法，不但推销了各地农民多年滞销的土产品，供应城市一部分工业原料及日用的需要，而且也改变了私商资金不足营业不振，及土产公司本身亏累的现象。同时该公司着重经营私商力所不及的远地的大宗土产调剂，对沟通城乡贸易、促进物资交流，及改进公私关系各方面都有利。这一经验是值得推广的。
