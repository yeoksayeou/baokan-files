　　Xinhua News Agency, August 15th, TASS dispatch from August 13th: The Japanese Communist Party's Diet delegation recently issued a letter to the Japanese people regarding the closing of the Diet's Eighth Session. The letter states: The convocation of the Diet's Eighth Session was to increase the military cooperation of the treacherous Yoshida Cabinet. In order to plunder and suppress the people, the Yoshida Cabinet openly expressed at this session its intention to cooperate in the war against the Korean people who are fighting for national unification. Although the Diet was in session, the Yoshida government insisted on government orders to establish a National Police Reserve Force and expand the "Maritime Safety Agency." These actions by the Yoshida Cabinet are intended to restore the police state and effectively establish an army. The Yoshida Cabinet is bypassing the Diet to carry out these actions. Without a doubt, these actions violate the Potsdam Declaration and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission.

　　The Yoshida Cabinet has demonstrated that the policy it is pursuing opposes the overall peace treaty desired by the entire Japanese people for the benefit of international monopoly capital and is hostile to the Soviet Union, New China, Korea, and democratic countries around the world. The letter points out: The Yoshida Cabinet is doing this in order to drag Japan into a new war of aggression. To this end, the Yoshida Cabinet is cracking down on the Communist Party and intensifying the suppression of all people's forces.

　　The letter emphasizes: "In this way, the Diet has become a fascist Diet serving international monopoly capital. In view of this unprecedentedly serious crisis for the Japanese nation, the Communist Party will fight to the utmost against cooperation in the war being waged for the benefit of international monopoly capital, against fascism, militaristic colonial plunder and suppression, to strive for the independence and freedom of our motherland, to strive for the stability and improvement of the people's lives, and to strive for world peace. To achieve this goal, we, together with all the people, urge the Socialist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and other individuals to form a broad democratic national front."

　　The letter concludes: "Japanese people! Any regime that violates the will of the nation will ultimately fail in its policies. We call on the people of the whole country to rise up and fight for a democratic national front, which will unite all the forces of patriots regardless of social status or party affiliation. Our party is determined to fight forever at the forefront of this movement, contributing all our strength to our country and nation."

　　日共议员团号召人民加强斗争
    斥法西斯国会助长吉田内阁卖国勾当  声明日共决竭力争取独立自由与和平
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社十三日讯：日本共产党国会议员团顷就国会第八次会议的闭幕，发表告日本人民书。该书称：国会第八次会议的召集，是为了增大卖国的吉田内阁的军事合作。为了掠夺人民和镇压人民，吉田内阁在这次会议上公开表示了它在反对正为全国统一而战斗的朝鲜人民的战争中合作的意图。虽然国会在开会期间，但吉田政府仍坚持由政府下令建立国家警察后备队与扩大“海上保安厅”。吉田内阁的这些行动，是要恢复警察国家并实际上建立起陆军。吉田内阁正在绕过国会，进行此事。毫无疑义，这些行动违反了波茨坦宣言与远东委员会的决定。
    吉田内阁表明了它所奉行的政策，是为了国际独占资本的利益而反对全体日本人民所期望的全面和约，并敌视苏联、新中国、朝鲜和全世界民主国家。该书指出：吉田内阁这样做，是为了把日本卷入新的侵略战争。为此，吉田内阁就取缔共产党与加紧镇压一切人民力量。
    该书强调称：“这样，国会已变成为国际垄断资本服务的法西斯国会了。鉴于日本民族的这样史无前例的严重危机，共产党将竭力斗争，反对在为国际垄断资本的利益而正进行的战争中合作，反对法西斯主义、军事性的殖民掠夺与镇压，争取我们祖国的独立与自由，争取人民生活的安定与改善，争取世界和平。为了达到这个目的，我们与全体人民一道，敦劝社会党、劳农党与其他人士，组成广泛的民主民族战线。”
    该书在结语中称：“日本人民！任何违背民族意志的政权，它的政策终将失败。我们号召全国人民起来，为民主民族战线而斗争，这一战线将不分社会地位和党派，联合爱国者的一切力量。本党决将永远在这一运动的前列斗争，把一切力量贡献给我们的国家和民族。”
