　　Tianjin District Tax Bureaus Flexibly Apply the Lüda Experience
    Breaking Through False Accounts and Stabilizing Business Sentiment
    Bureaucratic Work Style of Leading Organs Should Be Corrected
    [This Newspaper] The second quarter industrial and commercial tax collection work in Tianjin District, Hebei Province, has concluded in all areas from July 1st to July 25th, except for Jinghai and the towns of Yangliuqing and Hangu, which started later or had other special reasons for not finishing on time. The entire district completed tax payments equivalent to 2,131,210 jin of rice, exceeding the district bureau's budgeted tax revenue by more than 6.5% (excluding outstanding payments in individual counties and towns). Hangu, Wuqing, and Tianjin counties had the highest completion rates.
    
    Absorbing the Lüda Tax Collection Experience and Flexibly Adopting Three Methods
    This district's tax collection work absorbed the Lüda experience and adopted three methods based on different regions and industries: self-reporting, account verification, and rate-based calculation; self-reporting, public discussion, and typical investigation; and periodic fixed tax amounts determined by the tax bureau. The previous method of assigning representative tax amounts (i.e., evaluating false scores) was completely abolished, reversing and breaking through various tax resistance behaviors by some merchants, such as complaining about heavy taxes, using false accounts, and concealing income. During collection, except for periodic fixed amounts, the remaining taxes were collected by separately calculating turnover and income and merging them according to rates. Self-reporting and calculation were carried out in a planned and evidence-based manner, enabling merchants to understand tax standards and calculate themselves, thereby stabilizing business sentiment and dispelling doubts and concerns about the policy, such as "collapse sooner, collapse later, collapse sooner or later, might as well close down and stop business early." Some merchants said: "The government collects taxes according to regulations, and we have a bottom line in our minds, so we feel at ease doing business. Profit and loss depend on management, not just on paying taxes."
    
    In-depth Investigation Breaks Through Concealment and False Accounts; Implementing Strict Investigation and Lenient Treatment Yields Significant Results
    In order to strengthen organizational leadership and break through concealment and false accounts by some merchants, Hangu town organized a collection committee composed of the town's mayor and deputy mayor, the director of the tax bureau, the chief of the finance section, the chief of the industry and commerce section, the chief of the public security bureau, the director of the cooperative, the manager of the People's Bank, and the chairman of the trade union. Each department selected a certain number of cadres to form working groups, under which were established promotion committees and evaluation committees. Other counties such as Wuqing also conducted in-depth investigations and understanding from top to bottom, thereby breaking through serious concealment and false reporting by some merchants. For example, the Sesang cart transportation team in Hangu (consisting of 107 carts, uniformly collected by the transportation industry association) reported an income of over 98.13 million yuan, but expenses reached over 100 million yuan, resulting in a loss of over 6.8 million yuan. Direct account verification was conducted three times without results. Later, cadres conducted in-depth investigations from the side and found that the team had 27 million yuan of transportation income that was not recorded in the accounts from Chemical Factories No. 1 and No. 2 alone. Similar examples of concealment and false accounts being broken through existed in Lutai and Hangu Port in Ninghe, and Wuqing. For these problems, except for the Hangu cart transportation team, which was punished for committing the same offense during the first quarter collection, the principle of strict investigation and lenient treatment was adopted to influence others through education, resulting in significant results. For example, after two companies in Langfang were found to have false accounts and were educated without punishment, three companies, including Deyong, a cotton business, and Yirentang, a pharmacy, voluntarily reported their false accounts.
    
    Grasping Typical Examples to Promote Evaluation; Burdens are Approaching Fairness and Reasonableness
    In terms of burdens, counties and towns generally emphasized grasping typical materials to promote and grasp evaluation, thereby basically making burdens approach fairness and reasonableness, and correcting the past phenomenon of being too heavy on large businesses and too light on small businesses, or vice versa, or imbalances between regions. For example, in Hangu town, Sesang was heavy and Hangu was light in the first quarter, and this was corrected in accordance with the actual situation during this collection. Similar situations in other counties and towns generally achieved grasping policies and correcting policies in this collection, giving a good impression to industrial and commercial households.
    
    Establishing a Unified Invoice System Lays the Foundation for Account-Based Collection
    In order to leverage the role of organizations, some regions absorbed the Lüda experience, organized merchants, divided them into groups, formulated covenants, and implemented mutual guarantees to improve merchants' awareness. For example, after this was implemented in Langfang and Yangliuqing (with Langfang doing the best), it played a good role in self-reporting and evaluation. At the same time, some counties and towns also established a unified invoice system. For example, 300 out of 390 households in Langfang town have already established it; other places such as Hangu Beitang town and Yangliuqing have also implemented this system. This controlled tax sources, understood the business situation of industrial and commercial households, and laid the foundation for account-based collection.
    
    Cadres' Policy and Business Skills are Low
    Errors Occurred in Some Regions
    However, due to the low policy and business skills of some cadres, some errors and shortcomings of principle also occurred as the work progressed. For example, in Yangliuqing town, due to the lack of in-depth typical investigation work, the turnover was evaluated too low after the merchants self-reported their expenses, and some were evaluated without any surplus. Repeated changes delayed the work, and tax revenue suffered undue losses (the completion figures for self-reporting and evaluation households decreased by more than 25% compared to the first quarter). Furthermore, Wuqing only extracted one day's cash flow to extrapolate the burden for three months. In Cuihuangkou town, when working on typical households, the emphasis was on large households, so it could not represent the general situation, resulting in excessively light or heavy burdens.
    
    Individual Cadres Have an Unclear Understanding of Policies and Rectification; Showing a Lack of Initiative
    In addition, some individual cadres have an unclear understanding of policies, and coupled with the ongoing rectification campaign, they lacked initiative and were afraid of making mistakes. For example, when the Sesang tax office was collecting taxes, a theater originally made a net profit of over 60 million yuan, but the director of the office, Wang, did not collect income tax because the theater said it "didn't make money." Another example is Zhang Bingjun, deputy director of Yangliuqing town, who always said: "Let's collect a little less! So as not to create a forced order again." There were also individual county and town leading cadres who did not pay enough attention to tax collection work and were divorced from the masses in their work style, so progress was very slow. For example, the work was deployed at the joint meeting of the district bureau on June 20th, but the work in Yangliuqing town was still stuck in the evaluation stage on July 24th; the bureau also failed to effectively promote the business association at the lower level, so the business association could not play a greater role.
    
    The occurrence of these shortcomings and deviations is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of the district bureau's leadership, insufficient and timely supervision and inspection, and insufficient understanding of the situation. In particular, the failure to promptly understand the shortcomings in the implementation of the unified invoice system in Yangliuqing town. Furthermore, the failure to promptly promote the experience created by Langfang in the collection shows that the disconnection between the upper and lower levels is very serious and should be corrected in the future.

　　天津专区各税局灵活运用旅大经验
    突破假账稳定经营情绪
    领导机关官僚主义作风应改正
    【本报讯】河北省天津专区第二季工商业税征收工作，除静海及杨柳青、汉沽两镇因开始较晚或其他特殊原因未按期结束外，其他地区均自七月一日开始至二十五日全部结束。全专区完成款数折米二百一十三万一千二百一十斤，超过专局预算税款百分之六点五强（个别县镇尾欠尚不包括在内），其中以汉沽、武清、天津三县完成数最多。
    吸取旅大征税经验灵活采用三种办法
    该专区此次征收工作是吸取了旅大经验，根据不同地区、不同行户，采取了自报查账依率计征、自报公议典型调查与定期定额税局核定三种办法，彻底废止了过去指分代表纳税额（即评假分数）的征收方法，扭转与突破了某些商人的叫重、假账、匿报等种种抗税行为。征收时除定期定额外，其余均采取了营业额、所得额分别计算依率合并征收，并有计划、有依据地进行自报计征，使商人知道了纳税标准，自己能够核算，因而稳定了经营情绪，打破了“早垮，晚垮，早晚得垮，不如早早关门歇业”的对政策的怀疑和顾虑。有的商户说：“政府征税按章程办，我们心里有了底，做买卖也塌心了。赔赚在经营，不光在纳税。”
    深入调查突破匿报假账实行严查宽处收效显著
    为了加强组织领导与突破某些商人的匿报、假账，汉沽镇即由正副镇长、税务局长、财政科长、工商科长、公安局长、合作社主任、人民银行经理、职工会主任等组织了征收委员会，并由各部门抽调出一定干部组成工作组，下设推动委员会与评议委员会。其他如武清等县亦自上而下深入调查了解，因而突破了部分商人严重的匿报、假报等抗税行为。如汉沽塞上马车运输队（计一百零七辆车，由运输业公会统一征收），自报收益额九千八百一十三万余元，开销却达一亿余元，不但并无所得，反而赔了六百八十余万元，正面查账查了三次无结果，后由干部深入由侧面了解，仅从化学一、二厂等单位中查出该队共有二千七百万元的运输收益未入账。宁河芦台、汉沽港、武清等地均有类似匿报、假账而被突破的例子。对这些问题，除汉沽马车运输队第一季征收时犯过给以处罚外，其他均本严查宽处方针，通过教育以影响其他，结果收效很大。如廊坊查出两家假账未加处罚加以教育后，即有棉业德聚永、药业育仁堂等三家自动报出假账。
    掌握典型推动评议负担接近公平合理
    在负担方面，一般县、镇均重视了掌握典型材料，推动和掌握评议，因而基本上使负担接近公平合理，纠正了过去某些地区大重小轻、大轻小重或地区之间的不平衡现象。如汉沽镇第一季塞上重、汉沽轻，在此次征收中已根据实际情况作了合乎政策的纠正。以及其他各县、镇的类似情形，在这次征收中，一般均做到了掌握政策与端正政策，给了工商户以良好影响。
    建立统一发票制度打下按账计征基础
    又为了发挥组织作用，有的地区吸取旅大经验，把商户组织起来，划分小组、制定公约，实行相互联保，提高商人觉悟。如廊坊、杨柳青两地实行后（其中廊坊做得最好），对自报和评议均起了良好作用。同时，有的县、镇还建立了统一的发货票制度。如廊坊全镇三百九十户中，即有三百户已经建立；其他如汉沽北塘全镇、杨柳青等地亦均实行了这种制度。这样，便控制了税源，了解了工商户营业情况，打下了按账计征的基础。
    干部政策业务水平低
    部分地区发生了错误
    但由于部分干部的政策业务水平低，随着工作的进展，也发生了一些原则性的错误与缺点。如杨柳青镇由于典型调查工作不深入，营业额在商户自报开销后评议得少了，有的却评得没有了盈余。反复变更，拖延了工作，税收也受到了不应有的损失（自报评议户完成数字与第一季的对比，下降了百分之二十五强）。又如武清只抽出一天的流水账来推算三个月的负担。崔黄口镇在搞典型户时，着重大户，因而不能代表一般，而发生了负担上的畸轻畸重现象。
    个别干部对政策与整风认识不清表现小手小脚
    此外，还有个别干部对政策认识不清，加之正值整风期间，因而小手小脚怕犯错误。如塞上税务所征税时，一家戏院本来净赚六千多万元，但该所王所长只听该院说“没赚钱”便不征所得税了。又如杨柳青镇副局长张秉钧总是这样说：“少征就少征点吧！省得又闹个强迫命令。”还有个别县、镇领导干部对税收工作重视不够，作风上脱离群众，因而进度很慢。如六月二十日专局联席会议时即布置了工作，而杨柳青镇到七月二十四日工作尚停留在评议阶段；该局对下层组织商联会也未很好推动，因此商联会不能起更大的作用。
    以上这些缺点、偏差的发生，与该专局领导上的官僚主义作风、督促检查不深入及时，对情况掌握不够是分不开的。特别是对杨柳青镇执行统一发货票中存有缺点的情况，未能及时了解。再如对廊坊在征收中所创造的经验未能及时加以推广，这说明了上下脱节是破为严重，今后应注意改正。
