　　[Report from this newspaper] After news broke that U.S. aircraft had invaded China's northeastern airspace, strafing our buildings, stations, and vehicles, resulting in casualties among our people and railway workers, the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union and the Railway Work Committee of the Youth League issued circular telegrams of protest. The Northeast Regional Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union called upon all 210,000 railway workers in the Northeast to unanimously protest the atrocities of U.S. imperialism. The entire crew of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, the Beijing Locomotive Depot, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, the Beijing Telegraph Office of the Ministry of Railways, and the employees of the Xizhimen Engineering Machinery Repair Plant of the Tianjin Railway Bureau unanimously denounced the American aggression.

　　The Circular Telegram from the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union and the Railway Work Committee of the Youth League

　　The National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union and the National Railway Work Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League jointly issued a circular telegram, supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to the U.S. government and his demands to the Security Council. The circular telegram stated: "Upon hearing the news that the invading U.S. troops in Korea used military aircraft to intrude into our northeastern territory, strafing our buildings and vehicles, causing deaths and injuries to our people, the 530,000 railway workers of China are extremely indignant. This brutal behavior of the U.S. military is intolerable to every Chinese person. We fully support the solemn statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government to the U.S. government and demand that the United Nations Security Council immediately stop this aggressive and provocative act of U.S. imperialism in violation of international law." The circular telegram also pointed out: "While invading the Korean people, the American aggressors have unreasonably declared that they would prevent our People's Liberation Army from advancing to Taiwan and have invaded our territorial waters with their Seventh Fleet. Now, they have even used aircraft to intrude into our northeastern border, strafing buildings, stations, vehicles, and our people. This is a serious crime of infringing upon Chinese sovereignty, killing Chinese people, and attempting to expand the war and destroy peace."

　　210,000 Railway Workers in the Northeast Console the Suffering Brothers and Protest the Atrocities of U.S. Aircraft

　　The 210,000 railway workers in the Northeast, who are currently diligently engaged in the third quarter transportation work competition to contribute to national economic construction, were extremely indignant upon learning that U.S. imperialist bandit aircraft had invaded Ji'an, Linjiang, Andong, and other places in our country, strafing our stations, locomotives, passenger cars, guard cars, and airports, and killing our worker brothers! In addition to sending telegrams to console the affected worker brothers and their families, they unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to the U.S. government. Railway workers and their families in the Andong-Meihe area bitterly denounced this bestial atrocity of the U.S. imperialists, vowing to exact a blood debt directly inflicted upon them. The Northeast Regional Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union issued a solemn protest statement. Li Mingzhe, Chairman of the Northeast Regional Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, issued a call to all railway workers in the Northeast regarding the killing of Chinese railway workers by U.S. aircraft, urging all railway workers in the Northeast to heighten their vigilance, unanimously protest the atrocities of U.S. imperialism, and to sincerely console the worker brothers who were killed or injured by U.S. aircraft. At the same time, they should turn their grief and indignation into strength, and support the just struggle of the Central People's Government with active actions in production and construction.

　　The "Mao Zedong" Locomotive Crew Resolves to Support the People's Liberation Army in Severely Attacking the U.S. Aggressors with Practical Actions

　　Guo Shude, the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, represented the entire crew in protesting the crime of the United States in infringing upon our national sovereignty. The protest letter stated: "The entire crew of our 'Mao Zedong' locomotive proposed on July 19th to support the People's Liberation Army in crushing American imperialist aggression and liberating Taiwan with practical actions in completing railway transportation. In the past month, we have completed 600,000 kilometers of safe driving within the section; we saved 42 tons of coal in 22 days. Today, we once again express our firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn protest to the U.S. government. We must turn our grief and indignation into strength and support the People's Liberation Army in severely attacking the American aggressors with practical actions!"

　　Workers of the Entire Beijing Locomotive Depot, Filled with Anger, Resolve to Do Their Work Well to Crush U.S. Imperialist Aggression

　　Under the leadership of the trade union, the workers of the entire Beijing Locomotive Depot held a symposium of representatives from various groups. The workers were filled with anger when they spoke. Xie Zhong of Locomotive No. 1579 said: "The old Americans are really 'a mouse licking a cat's nose, looking for death themselves.' They've already been beaten to a pulp in half of Korea, and now they're trying to scare us. Wrong! The Chinese people have long known that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, and this trick won't work! Our Locomotive No. 1579 will definitely ensure no accidents, eliminate related accidents, and at the same time, do a better job of plant protection to prevent special agents from taking the opportunity to sabotage, to support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest." Workers Lao He and Lao Zi both expressed that they were not afraid of U.S. imperialist aggression and believed that we have enough strength to give the U.S. imperialists an answer. Lao Wen of Locomotive No. 573 said: "I am determined to become more proficient in the three-shovel coal throwing system from now on to save coal and support the front lines." Tian Yuquan, a young worker, lives in Andong. His father was a ship worker who was killed by the Japanese. He said extremely angrily: "Imperialist countries are all from the same ancestor, and we can only survive by fighting!" The workers resolved to do their work even better and crush U.S. imperialist aggression. (Propaganda Group of the Beijing Locomotive Depot Trade Union)

　　Workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Protest

　　When the workers of the entire Fengtai Locomotive Depot saw the news of the American aircraft invading the Northeast, a wave of angry voices erupted. Everyone agreed that this was another act of war provocation after the failure of U.S. imperialism in Korea, and a further barbaric act of openly invading our country. In addition to supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to the U.S. government and the telegram to the Security Council, the workers also appealed to peace-loving people around the world to unite and eliminate imperialist aggression. (Yu Lianzhong)

　　All Employees of the Beijing Telegraph Office of the Ministry of Railways Strive to Eliminate Accidents and Support the Liberation of Taiwan

　　The employees of the Beijing Telegraph Office of the Ministry of Railways held a symposium on the 28th. The employees expressed their full support for Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and unanimously agreed that there was no need to fear this provocative act of the U.S. imperialists to undermine our peaceful construction, but to resolutely defeat them. Workers Yan Yunzi, telegraph operators Guan Guilin, and Guo Jingren said that everyone should unite, do their job well, complete their tasks, and support the liberation of Taiwan. Song Ziqiang said: "We have the strength to defeat imperialism. I am determined to eliminate accidents in the work competition and strive to earn merit!" Yuan Jun expressed that not only should he do his own work well, but also lead his two apprentices to become proficient in telegraph operations. Lei Kecheng, the telegraph foreman, said: "This atrocity of the U.S. imperialists is like throwing sand into our rice, not letting us eat. I will definitely contact the brother telegraph offices closely and do a good job in the entire railway telegraph business." The apprentice telegraph operator proposed writing a protest, which was unanimously approved. The trade union of the office also combined the opinions of the workers and issued a call for "zero accidents in one day" (from 18:00 on the 28th to 18:00 on the 29th), which received a warm response from all employees. The employees used practical actions to answer the U.S. imperialist aggression. (Lai Weiliang)

　　The Employees of the Xizhimen Mechanical Repair Plant Said: "Our Hearts Are Like They're on Fire!"

　　The employees of the Xizhimen Engineering Machinery Repair Plant of the Tianjin Railway Bureau wrote to this newspaper saying: Today, when all the employees of the factory saw the news of the unreasonable and brutal behavior of U.S. imperialism, our hearts were like they were on fire! We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and resolutely complete and exceed our tasks, pave the railway to Taiwan, and crush any aggressive behavior of U.S. imperialism. (Gu Shiyu)
