Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 11th: The East China Military Region Military and Political University of the People's Liberation Army has made preliminary achievements and accumulated experience in guiding the cultural learning of worker-peasant cadres.

The First Regiment of the university has 760 students, most of whom are from worker-peasant backgrounds with generally low levels of education, ranging from upper primary to junior high school, and even illiteracy. After more than half a year of cultural learning at the university, in terms of Chinese language, students in the A and B grades, who previously did not understand punctuation and grammar, are now generally able to use them, and their compositions generally grasp the central idea and are written in fluent language. Students in the C grade have generally increased their vocabulary and possess basic reading ability. In mathematics, students with higher levels have progressed from simple arithmetic word problems to elementary algebraic word problems, while those with lower levels have learned multiplication and division, and how to remove parentheses.

The regiment was established at the end of September last year and officially started classes in December. The entire course of study is tentatively set for two years, with each three months as a stage. The overall goal of education is to improve the cultural level of the students, enabling them to master certain scientific knowledge and become the backbone of building a modern, regularized national defense force. The general guiding principle of education is to combine theory with practice, and the masses with leadership, adopting a gradual and steady approach, and implementing the principles of seeking application, seeking precision, and seeking thoroughness.

The 760 students participating in the regiment's study are all veteran cadres who have undergone long periods of revolutionary war training. At the beginning of the study, the vast majority of students deeply felt the pain of having low cultural levels in their past work, so their enthusiasm for learning was very high. However, some students were not clear about the content of cultural learning, thinking that learning culture was just learning a few characters, and there was also a sense of impatience to learn culture in a blitzkrieg manner. Some students also lacked confidence in cultural learning, or were uneasy about studying away from their jobs and due to family difficulties, resulting in ideological fluctuations. These phenomena have been basically overcome after unfolding criticism and self-criticism.

Because the cultural levels of the students were different, the form of the learning organization was based on the students' Chinese language and mathematics levels, and divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D, and divided into many classes, carefully grading and classifying. For example, if the Chinese language was at level A and mathematics was at level C, they would enter the A-C level; if the Chinese language was at level C and mathematics was at level D, they would enter the C-D level. The content of education follows the principle of being concise and precise, combining general knowledge with specialized knowledge, from the shallow to the deep, from the near to the far. In terms of teaching methods, the principle of combining teacher lecturing and enlightenment with student self-study is adopted. Before lecturing, teachers hold preparatory meetings to study the specific circumstances of the educational objects, formulate detailed teaching plans, and then proceed step by step. In order to improve the lecturing level of teachers, the school and teachers formed a teaching evaluation committee to carry out teaching evaluation work, which initially improved the education methods and enhanced the education effect. On the student side, self-study is the main focus, advocating the spirit of "diligent study and asking questions" and "hard practice and writing," and thus there has been considerable achievement.

### 华东军大工农干部学习文化成绩显著

　　华东军大工农干部学习文化成绩显著
    【本报讯】据新华社南京十一日电：人民解放军华东军区军事政治大学在领导工农干部的文化学习上，已有了初步的成绩和经验。
    该校第一团七百六十名学员，绝大多数是工农出身，文化水平一般都很低，只有高小到初中的程度，甚至还有文盲；经过在学校半年多的文化学习，在国文方面，甲乙级的学员过去不懂标点和文法，现一般的已经都能使用，作文一般能抓住中心，文字通顺。丙级学员普遍增加了识字数量，具有粗浅阅读能力。数学方面，程度高的已经由简单的算术四则应用题学会了初等代数的四则应用题，程度低的也学会了算术中的乘除法和解括号。
    该团是在去年九月底成立，十二月正式开学，全部学程暂定为二年，每三个月作为一个阶段。教育的总目的是要提高学员们的文化水平，使他们能掌握一定的科学知识，而成为建设近代正规化国防军的骨干。教育的总方针是使理论与实际相结合，群众与领导相结合，并采取逐渐提高、稳步前进的步骤，和贯彻求用、求精、求通的原则。
    参加该团学习的七百六十名学员都是久经革命战争锻炼的老干部。学习开始时，绝大多数学员由于深感过去在工作中文化水平低的痛苦，所以学习情绪非常热烈。但其中也有一部分学员对文化学习的内容认识不清楚，认为学文化就是学几个字，还发生了想用突击方式来学文化的急躁情绪。也有某些学员对文化学习缺乏信心，或因离职学习和家庭困难等发生思想波动，不安心学习。这些现象经过展开批评与自我批评等，基本上得到了克服。
    因为学员的文化水平高低不一，因此，在学习组织的形式上，便按照学员国文及数学程度，各分甲、乙、丙、丁四级并分成许多班次，认真编级编班。如国文在甲级，数学在丙级，就入甲丙级；国文在丙级，数学在丁级，就入丙丁级。教育内容以少而精，一般知识与专门知识相结合为原则，由浅入深，由近而远。教学方法上，是采取教员讲授启发与学员自学相结合的原则。教员在讲课前都开准备会，研究教育对象的具体情况，订出详细的教学方案，然后按步就班，进行讲授。为了提高教员的讲授水平，校方与教员组成评教委员会，进行了评教工作，初步改进了教育方法，增强了教育效果。在学员方面以自学为主，提倡“勤学多问”、“苦练多写”的精神，因而有了相当的成绩。
