Fuel Department Manager Si Datong Office
Neglects Flood Prevention, Loses 2,000 Tons of Coal

[Reported by this newspaper] The director of the Datong office of the Central Fuel Department Managerial Division, Liu Wending, neglected flood prevention work, resulting in the loss of over 2,000 tons of stored coal. As early as late May to early June, the Datong Mining Bureau sent three consecutive letters to the office, suggesting the prompt removal of the Wagjinwan stored coal to avoid losses from floods. However, the office only issued an official letter to its Baidong Coal Station on June 3, stipulating that all stored coal should be removed by June 15, without sending anyone to inspect the implementation. On June 17, at around 4 p.m., mountain torrents erupted, washing away over 300 tons of stored coal. After the clerk reported the situation, the office leaders still believed it was not serious and did not take any effective measures. On June 28 and 29, mountain torrents erupted again, washing away another 1,700 tons of coal. The total loss from the three incidents amounted to 2,032 tons of stored coal. With each ton of coal priced at 70.907 jin of millet according to the fixed cost, the total loss translates to 144,083 jin of millet. After causing the above serious loss of state property, the leadership of the office still did not pay enough attention or conduct a deep review. As of July 21, none of the cadres above the section chief level had conducted an investigation, only a clerk was sent to "take a look" and write a "report" to the Central Fuel Department Managerial Division, considering the matter closed. According to the amount of coal stored in the coal yard in June and its transportation capacity, it was entirely possible to transport the coal stored on the floodway to a safe coal station if the leadership had paid attention and inspected it. However, the leaders of the office excessively trusted the instructions in the written documents and did not personally guide and inspect the actual work on the spot. This is the inevitable result of bureaucratic leadership. Therefore, it is suggested that the leadership of the office should take this matter as a lesson and conduct a deep review and self-criticism.

### 燃料部经理司大同办事处  忽视防洪损煤二千吨

　　燃料部经理司大同办事处
    忽视防洪损煤二千吨
    【本报讯】中央燃料部经理司所属大同办事处主任刘文定忽视防洪工作，致存煤损失二千余吨。早在五月下旬至六月初，大同矿务局曾连续三次致函该处，建议迅速运出挖金湾存煤，以免遭受洪水损失。但该处仅于六月三日以公函指示其所属白洞煤站，限于六月十五日前，将存煤一律提出，并没有派人检查执行情况。六月十七日下午四时许，山水暴发，冲走存煤三百余吨。办事员报告情况后，该处领导干部仍然认为不要紧，没有采取任何有效措施。至六月二十八、九两日，又因山洪暴发，两次冲走煤一千七百余吨。前后三次总计损失存煤二千零三十二吨，每吨煤价按定额成本七十点九零七斤小米计，总计折米十四万四千零八十三斤米。造成上述国家财富严重损失后，仍未引起该处领导上的高度重视和深刻检查。到七月二十一日为止，该处股长以上干部没一人去进行过调查，仅由某办事员去“看了看”，向中央燃料部经理司写了份“报告”就算完了事。根据该处煤场在六月份的存煤量和运输能力，只要领导上重视并加以检查，在洪水道上的存煤完全有条件运到安全的煤站。但由于该处领导上过分相信了文函的指示，而没有亲身到现场指导与检查实际工作，这是官僚主义领导所必然遭到的结果。因此建议：该处领导上应就此事做为教训，进行深刻的检查和检讨。
