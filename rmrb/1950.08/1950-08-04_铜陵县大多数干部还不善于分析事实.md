    Most Cadres in Tongling County Are Still Not Good at Analyzing Facts
    [This Newspaper] The Tongling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Anhui held a rectification meeting from July 12th to 16th, studying rectification instructions and, in connection with reviewing work, initially exposed a number of serious problems in the work of various units. For example, in implementing the burden policy, some cadres deliberately narrowed the scope of the burden to 20 to 30 percent in order to increase the burden on landlords and rich peasants. They did not study the superior's rent reduction instructions, but proceeded according to their own intentions, as well as using coercion and commandism, etc. This made the cadres attending the meeting realize that there were indeed phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of policy in their work. However, this review work revealed that most cadres were still not good at drawing conclusions from the analysis of facts and materials, and at distinguishing between individual errors and responsibilities. Most cadres first put on a label, and then used some facts to illustrate that there was bureaucracy and commandist style. Some talked a lot about past problems, but said very little about current problems; some liked to talk about trivial details of life, but did not talk about policy implementation. When criticizing leaders, some also showed bias, referring to all kinds of instructions issued by the leaders, reports made, and disciplines stipulated as "commandism." This was mainly because they had not grasped the spirit of the documents, and therefore these biases occurred. The county party committee immediately pointed this out. Now these cadres have returned to their respective work posts to conduct rectification studies in conjunction with reviewing their work.

    铜陵县大多数干部还不善于分析事实
    【本报讯】中共安徽铜陵县委于七月十二日至十六日召开整风会议，学习整风指示，结合检查工作，初步揭发了各单位工作中的若干严重问题。例如在执行负担政策时，有的干部故意将负担面缩小到百分之二十至三十，以加重地主富农的负担。对于上级的减租指示不研究，而按照自己意图进行。以及强迫命令等等。这样使到会干部认识到工作中确实存在着官僚主义、强迫命令与违反政策等现象。但在这次检查工作中暴露了大多数干部还不善于从分析事实分析材料中得出结论，并分清个人的错误和责任。多数干部先戴一个帽子，然后拿些事实来说明有官僚主义，有强迫命令作风。有的对过去的问题谈得多，而对目前的问题说得很少；有的好谈些生活细节问题，不谈执行政策问题。在批评领导时，也有些偏向，把领导上所发的各种指示，作的报告，规定的纪律，一律称之为“命令主义”。这主要是没有掌握文件的精神，因此发生了这些偏向。县委当即予以指出。现在这些干部已回到各个工作岗位上去结合检查工作，进行整风学习。（根据铜陵县委书记  高杰来稿编写）
