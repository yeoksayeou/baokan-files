Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 18th: Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued an order to the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the people of the whole country on the fifth anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15th." The order pointed out that with the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union, the economy and culture of the Korean people have developed rapidly, and the living standards of the working people have been continuously improved. However, the southern half of the Republic is under the heavy shackles of the American "philanthropists," causing the people to live a miserable life. The enemy mistakenly believed that the People's Army was vulnerable and妄想妄想 to turn the entire Korea into a U.S. colony and a base for provoking war in the Far East, and brutally launched a war of aggression.

The order then pointed out that the People's Army, which quickly turned to the counter-offensive, learned how to annihilate the enemy's living forces and crush the enemy's plans in the actual combat process. The People's Army has killed 29,215 enemy officers and soldiers, wounded and captured more than 40,000 enemy troops, and seized many spoils of war. The U.S. military and the remnants of the Rhee Syngman puppet army now occupy only a small area in the southern half of the Republic. The day of liberating the entire Korean territory from the hands of the American armed interventionists is not far away.

The order emphasized that the war will become more intense in the final stage because the enemy has not been completely annihilated; the American aggressors will struggle desperately to maintain their rule over the Korean people.

The order called on the Korean people to continue to reinforce the front line with fresh troops, eliminate the vicious enemy, and strive for the final victory; the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and people in the rear should make dedicated efforts to transport more military supplies and food to the front line; railway workers should continuously and promptly transport all military supplies to the front line.

General Kim Il-sung finally congratulated all soldiers and officers of the People's Army, Navy, and issued the following order:

One, soldiers, machine gunners, artillerymen, drivers, and naval personnel must fully master and cherish their weapons. Logistics staff should ensure that no military supplies are wasted, and be good at covering military supplies and equipment during enemy air raids, so as to ensure all supplies reach the front line.

Two, rear workers should systematically supply ammunition and materials to the front line, rationally use captured materials, and quickly repair damaged materials to supply the front line.

Three, all commanders must be good at organizing and guiding the maneuver and flanking tactics of various troops, and be good at fighting skillfully and flexibly. The People's Army must strengthen discipline and show that it is an army loyal to the people, completing the mission of liberating the territory.

Four, the entire Korean People's Army and Navy must finally sweep away the U.S. interventionist forces and the remnants of the Rhee Syngman puppet army, to make August the month of complete liberation of Korean territory, without giving the enemy a chance to breathe.

Five, male and female guerrillas should strengthen guerrilla warfare in the rear of the U.S. interventionists, destroy enemy communication means, crush enemy staff headquarters and combat equipment, and give the enemy a fatal blow.

　　金日成将军“八一五”发布命令
    号召人民继续支援前线消灭凶恶的敌人  要使八月成为完全解放朝鲜国土的月份
    【新华社平壤十八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军最高司令官金日成将军，于“八一五”朝鲜解放五周年纪念日，向朝鲜人民军指战员及全国人民发布命令。命令指出：朝鲜人民在苏联的真挚援助下，经济文化迅速发展，劳动人民的生活水准日益提高。而共和国的南半部则由于美国“慈善家们”沉重的枷锁，使人民过着悲惨的生活。敌人错误地认为人民军不堪一击，妄想将全朝鲜变为美国的殖民地和在远东挑拨战争的基地，蛮横地发动了侵略战争。
    命令接着指出：迅速转入反攻的人民军在实际战斗的过程中，学会了歼灭敌人有生力量及粉碎敌人计划的方法。人民军已经击毙了敌军官兵二万九千二百十五名，击伤和俘掳敌军四万余名，并缴获了许多战利品。美国军队与李承晚残余伪军现在仅占有共和国南半部很小的地区。从美国武装干涉者手中解放朝鲜全部国土的日子已经为期不远。
    命令着重指出：战争到最后阶段将更为激烈，因为敌人尚未完全歼灭；美国侵略者为了保持对朝鲜人民的统治，将作垂死的挣扎。
    命令号召朝鲜人民续向前线增援生力军，消灭凶恶的敌人，争取最后的胜利；朝鲜的工人、农民、知识分子和后方人民要作献身的努力，向前线运送更多的军需品和食粮；铁道工人要不断地及时向前线输送一切军需品。
    金日成将军最后向人民军陆海军全体战士和军官致贺，并发布如下的命令：
    一、战士、机枪手、炮兵、驾驶员及海军要完全精通并爱护自己的武器。后勤工作人员保证不浪费任何军需品，在敌机空袭时要善于掩护军需器材，务使全部供给前线。
    二、后方工人应有系统地供应军火与物资给前线，合理地使用夺获的物资，迅速修复被破坏的物资以供应前线。
    三、所有指挥官要善于组织和指导各种部队的机动和迂回战术，善于巧妙地和灵活地作战。人民军要加强纪律，显示出自己是为人民尽忠的军队，完成解放国土的使命。
    四、全朝鲜人民军和海军要最后扫荡美国干涉者的军队和李承晚残余伪军，要使八月成为完全解放朝鲜国土的月份，不给敌人以喘息机会。
    五、男女游击队员要在美国干涉者的后方加强游击战，破坏敌人通讯手段，粉碎敌人的参谋部和战斗器材，予敌人以致命的打击。
