(Xinhua News Agency, August 27th) Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, Zhou Enlai, sent a cable to the President of the United Nations Security Council, Malik, and Secretary-General Trygve Lie, regarding the intrusion of US aircraft into our territorial airspace, strafing our buildings, stations, vehicles, and Chinese people, resulting in casualties. He demanded that the Security Council sanction the US forces invading Korea and immediately take measures to compel the US government to withdraw its aggressor troops from Korea. The text of Foreign Minister Zhou's cable is as follows:

To Mr. Malik, President of the United Nations Security Council, and Secretary-General Trygve Lie, Lake Success, New York:

According to reports from the Northeast People's Government, on August 27th, military aircraft of the US forces invading Korea intruded into the airspace of the People's Republic of China, strafing our buildings, stations, vehicles, and Chinese people along the right bank of the Yalu River, causing casualties. The situation is extremely serious. The facts are as follows: At 10:04 AM today, two US B-29 aircraft flew over the city of Ji'an and its vicinity on the right bank of the middle reaches of the Yalu River, circling and reconnoitering for more than ten minutes. At 10:05 AM on the same day, three US P-51 aircraft and one Mosquito aircraft, a total of four, flew over the city of Linjiang and the Dalizi railway station area on the right bank of the upper reaches of the Yalu River, first strafing the station opposite Dalizi for two minutes, then strafing the railway line for two minutes, damaging one locomotive. At 11:04 AM, in the same area, four more US aircraft strafed the Jiangqiao area for eleven minutes, damaging two locomotives, one passenger car, and one guard car, injuring one driver and one resident. At 2:30 PM on the same day, one US B-29 aircraft flew over the city of Andong on the right bank of the lower reaches of the Yalu River, circling and reconnoitering for one lap. At 4:40 PM, two more US P-51 aircraft came over the Andong airport, strafing for two minutes, injuring nineteen workers, killing three, and destroying two trucks.

This provocative and brutal act by the US forces invading Korea in intruding into Chinese territorial airspace is a serious crime of infringing upon Chinese sovereignty, massacring Chinese people, and attempting to expand the war and destroy peace, which the Chinese people can never tolerate. I, representing the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, in addition to lodging a serious protest and demand with US Secretary of State Acheson, hereby submit a complaint and suggestion to the United Nations Security Council: For the sake of peace and security in Asia and the world, the United Nations Security Council has an undeniable responsibility to sanction this provocative and brutal act by the US forces invading Korea in intruding into Chinese airspace, and should immediately take measures to ensure that the US government completely withdraws its aggressor troops from Korea, so as to avoid the expansion of the situation and facilitate the peaceful mediation of the Korean issue by the United Nations.

Respectfully submitted, I hope you will investigate.

Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
August 27, 1950, in Beijing
