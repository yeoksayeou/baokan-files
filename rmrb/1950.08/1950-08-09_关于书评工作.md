	On Book Review Work
    Editor
    Here, based on materials from several major newspapers and magazines across the country, we will discuss the issue of book review work.
    Looking first at newspapers, besides our publication, Shanghai Dagong Bao has the "Reading and Publishing" weekly, Hankou Changjiang Daily has the "Book Review and Introduction" bi-weekly, Shanghai Jiefang Daily recently released a supplement related to publishing, and Jinan Dazhong Daily has an irregular book review supplement. Guangming Daily, Northeast Daily, Xinhua Daily, and Southern Daily all occasionally publish book reviews in their supplements.
    Looking at several major magazines, "China Youth" once published a relatively systematic "Reference Catalog of Youth Reading Materials." "Science Popularization Newsletter" regularly has a "Book Review and Introduction" column, reviewing natural science books and has published "Selection of Natural Science Reading Materials for Cultural Palaces." "People's Education" has articles criticizing educational books in each issue. The newly published "Translation Bulletin" conducts professional criticism and research on translation work, which will have a positive impact on improving the quality of translation work. In addition, "People's Literature" has published special articles on literary criticism in almost every issue since its publication. "Literary Gazette" has strengthened criticism and review from its most recent issues.
    Generally speaking, the newly established book review work has played a certain role. It has developed a critical atmosphere based on a broad readership, making demands on authors, translators, and publishers, requiring them to improve the quality of books and periodicals with a serious attitude responsible to the people. On the other hand, whether they are compilers, authors, translators, or publishers (including administrative organs, public and private publishers), they can humbly accept criticism, seriously review it, and immediately take appropriate action – such as stopping sales, revising and reprinting, or even destroying the plates and reprinting. This demonstrates the highly responsible spirit of compilers, translators, and publishers.
    Regarding the general attitude of criticism, it is generally proper, and there are few cases of making harsh demands or reproaches on those being criticized. Although there are some criticisms with relatively severe wording, such as our publication's criticism of the "Times Encyclopedia Small Series," Jiefang Daily's accusation of the Power Press's haphazard publishing of books, and "Reading and Publishing's" repeated criticism of Fei Mingjun's translation of "Historical Materialism Chinese History," these are ultimately in the minority, and there are reasons for adopting such attitudes. Because those books have committed unforgivable errors against the people in terms of politics, ideology, and the level of translation, reaching a point of intolerance among readers. The readers' demands reflected in these articles are still beneficial to the entire publishing industry and publishing work.
    However, there are still shortcomings in the overall book review work, which need to be greatly improved.
    First, the planning and guidance of criticism are insufficient. The manuscripts for general book review supplements mainly come from reader submissions, and readers' submissions can only focus on personal perspectives, so their opinions cannot take care of the overall situation, and it is not easy to show planning and strong guidance. Although the comments on dictionaries, geography textbooks, and the "Times Encyclopedia Small Series" published in the first few issues of our publication have made some efforts in this regard, they have not been able to do so regularly since then. "Reading and Publishing" has recently organized criticisms of books on land reform, study manuals, and college entrance guidance in a more systematic way, which represents a good direction.
    Second, some of the book reviews published in newspapers and magazines are still too impatient and too harsh. While we all hope that every one of our publications contains completely correct and healthy content, it would not necessarily contribute to the progress of publications if we were to "severely criticize" all books with errors and shortcomings based on this subjective desire. Criticism workers must be good at distinguishing between the different shortcomings and errors of different publications. We should distinguish between reactionary and backward, between hypocritical swindlers and ordinary offenders. Political errors and errors in ideological and theoretical issues do not necessarily carry equal weight, and errors of principle and individual technical errors should be significantly distinguished. There are bound to be some shortcomings in generally good books, and they should certainly not be treated the same way as basically bad books. Our book reviewers should carefully carry out these distinctions, so that we can distinguish between the important and the urgent, and our work will be more beneficial to readers, authors, and publishers.
    The basic spirit of our book review work is "benevolence." Facts show that most publishers are striving to move forward on the road of progress and can respect public opinion and the opinions of the broad masses of readers. Book reviewers should become good teachers and helpful friends of publishers. Critics should not simply hold a "fault-finding" attitude, but must have the enthusiasm to actively help publishers do their work well. Discovering books that are worth introducing to readers is the greatest joy of book reviewers. Some publishers, although striving to do their work well, sometimes publish careless and insufficiently serious books. Book reviewers should naturally point them out to them seriously, but this is still different from completely speculative and fraudulent philistine booksellers, and they should not be portrayed as falling into irredeemable errors.
    Third, the work of criticism and introduction is not yet popular enough and cannot be done in a timely manner. A "reading group" of the People's Daily suggested to our publication: immediately contact progressive publishers across the country, read all the new books published in the whole month, and then publish the results. But we have not been able to do so so far. Many readers come to us to complain after being "fooled" into buying books. In addition, although some book review sections or supplements in other newspapers and periodicals occasionally have some "New Book Parade" and "New Book Review and Introduction," they are not doing enough. It is very necessary to do book review work in a timely manner, so that it can help publishers' favorable distribution on the one hand, and help readers make appropriate choices for books and periodicals on the other. The methods provided by "China Youth" and "Science Popularization Newsletter" to provide selection lists are also worth emulating. This certainly requires the book review sections of newspapers and periodicals to work harder in organizing manuscripts. If publishers themselves can establish a faithful self-recommendation system (that is, publishers recommend good books themselves), it is also a good way. As long as such mutual cooperation and close contact, the shortcomings of being unpopular and untimely can certainly be corrected.
    Serious book review work is still very young in our country, and it is not easy to make this work go the way it should go. The most important task of book review work should be to improve the political, ideological, and scientific level of publications. Our working attitude must be the attitude of "curing diseases and saving people" and "benevolence," so for publications with shortcomings, in addition to passive criticism, we must also put forward active and guiding opinions, so that we can provide more help to publishing work. We are willing to encourage each other with comrades across the country who are engaged in book review work.

　　关于书评工作
    编者
    在这里，我们根据全国若干主要报纸和杂志的材料，来谈谈关于书评工作问题。
    先从报纸来看，除了本刊而外，上海大公报有《读书与出版》周刊，汉口长江日报有《图书评介》双周刊，上海解放日报新近出了有关出版的副刊，济南大众日报有不定期的书评副刊。光明日报、东北日报、新华日报和南方日报副刊中，都间有书评刊出。
    再就几种主要的杂志来看。《中国青年》曾开列过一个较有系统的《青年读物参考目录》。《科学普及通讯》经常设有《书刊评介》栏，就自然科学书籍进行评介，并曾刊出过《文化宫自然科学读物选目》。《人民教育》每期有批评教育书籍的文字。新近出版的《翻译通报》，就翻译工作方面，作专业的批评与研究，这对于提高翻译工作的质量将会起积极的影响。此外，《人民文学》自从出版以来，差不多每期都有关于文艺批评的专文发表。《文艺报》从最近几期起，更把批评与检讨加强了。
    从总的方面说，刚刚建立起的书评工作是起了一定的作用的。它从广大的读者群的基础上，发展了批评风气，向著译者和出版者要求，以对人民负责的严肃态度来提高书刊水平。另一方面，不论是编著者、译者或出版者（包括行政机关、公私营出版业者），对于批评都能虚心接受，认真检讨，并立刻作适当的处理——如停止发售、修订再版，甚至毁版重排。这表现了编译者和出版者高度负责的精神。
    再就一般的批评态度说，大体也都是正当的，对被批评者作苛刻的要求或督责的情形是很少的。虽也有措辞比较严峻的批评，例如本刊对于《时代百科小丛书》的批评，解放日报对动力出版社胡乱出书的指责，《读书与出版》对费明君《唯物史观中国史》译文的一再批评，但这究竟是少数，而所以要采取这样的态度也是有理由的。因为那些书籍在政治上、思想上以及译文的水平上对人民犯着的不可宽恕的错误，使读者达到了不能容忍的程度。从这几篇文字上所反映的读者要求，对于整个出版业及出版工作还是有利的。
    但在整个书评工作中，缺点还是有的，而且是需要大力改进的。
    第一，是批评的计划性与指导性不够。一般书评专刊的稿件，大都以读者投稿为主要来源，而读者来稿多只能从个人的角度着眼，因此他们的意见就无法照顾到全面，也就不容易表现出计划性和有力的指导性来。本刊最初几期发表的对于辞典、地理课本和《时代百科小丛书》的评论文字，虽然在这方面曾尽力做了一些，以后就没有能经常这样做。《读书与出版》最近几期，较有系统地组织了关于土改问题、学习手册和升学指导等类书籍的批评，这代表着一个很好的方向。
    第二，报纸杂志上发表的书评部分地也还有过于性急，过于苛刻的。我们固然都希望我们的每一本出版物中都包含着完全正确而健康的内容，但如果本着这种主观愿望而对一切有错误有缺点的书一例《痛加挞伐》，那就并不见得有助于出版物的进步。对于各种不同的出版物的不同的缺点与错误，批评工作者必须善于加以区分。应该区别反动和落后，区别假冒为善的骗子和一般的犯错误者。政治性的错误与思想问题理论问题上的错误并不一定具有同等的重量，原则性的错误和个别的技术性的错误更应加以显著的区别。在大体上好的书中也难免有一些缺点，这和基本上不好的书当然不能一律看待。我们的书评工作者应该谨慎地进行这种种区别，这样才能分清轻重、缓急，我们的工作对于读者、作者和出版者才是更有益的。
    我们的书评工作的基本精神是“与人为善”。事实表明大多数出版者都是努力向进步的路上走，都能尊重舆论和广大读者的意见，书评工作者就应该成为出版者的良师益友。批评者不应该是单纯抱着“找岔子”的态度，而必须怀着积极地帮助出版者做好他们的工作的热情。发现了值得介绍给读者的书籍，那才是书评工作者的最大的愉快。有的出版者虽然努力想做好工作，而有时也出版了马虎的不够严肃的书籍，书评工作者自然应该认真地向他们指出，但这和完全投机骗人的市侩书商究竟还是有所不同，也就不应该把他们描写成是陷入了无可救药的错误中间。
    第三，是批评与介绍工作做得还不够普及，不能及时。一个人民日报的“读报小组”向本刊建议：立即跟全国进步出版业者联系起来，把全月出版的新书都看一遍，然后将结果刊登出来。但我们却至今没有做到。很多读者在买书“上当”以后，来信向我们申诉。另外一些报刊上的书评版或副刊中，虽间或有些“新书巡礼”、“新书评介”，但做得都还不够。把书评工作及时地做好，使它一方面能帮助出版者的有利发行，同时又能帮助读者对书刊作适宜选择，这是非常必要的工作。像《中国青年》和《科学普及通讯》提供选目的办法，也是值得仿效的。这固然需要报刊上的书评版在组织稿件时多多努力，假如出版者自己能建立一种忠实的自我推荐制度（就是由出版者自己来推荐好书），也是一种良好的办法。只要这样的相互合作与密切联系，一定可以把不普及和不及时的缺点纠正过来。
    认真的书评工作在我国还很年青，要使这个工作走向它应该走的道路，并不是容易的事情。书评工作最重要的任务，应该是提高出版物的政治、思想和科学水平。我们的工作态度必须是“治病救人”、“与人为善”的态度，因此对于有缺点的出版物，除消极的批评以外，同时还得提出积极的带指导性的意见，这样对出版工作才有更多的帮助。我们愿与全国从事书评工作的同志们共相策勉。
