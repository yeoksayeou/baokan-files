　　Integrating Rectification with Work
    Preliminary Improvements in Work in the Shijiazhuang Special District
    [This newspaper's report] The rectification campaign in the Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei, which began in early July, has led to improvements in certain areas of work over the past month due to its close integration with current tasks. For example, during the current rainy season's grain protection efforts, the majority of cadres at the special district's grain depots demonstrated a high sense of responsibility by venturing out in the rain to inspect warehouses in various counties. Comrades Liu Qiufa and Liu Jie of the depot, due to the heavy river flow and muddy roads which made travel by vehicle inconvenient, walked to Luancheng and Zhengding for inspection. Under the influence of their exemplary actions, lower-level cadres also took action. All the cadres stationed at the No. 1 Direct-Controlled Depot in Shijiazhuang discovered that the millet in the depot was overheating. To prevent mold, taking advantage of a break in the rain, more than 30 cadres worked together to disperse over 300,000 jin of grain in three hours. The comrades at the No. 2 Depot worked continuously for three nights to disperse over 1.1 million jin of stored millet, allowing the temperature to dissipate and preventing mold. In addition, cadres in various counties also demonstrated a spirit of actively protecting state property. Director Du of the Lingshou County Warehouse, Director Zhai of the Yuanshi County Warehouse, and Director Lü of the Zhao County Warehouse all repaired buildings and inspected stored grain in the rain.
    After this period of rectification and study, the work style of the cadres has also greatly improved. In this summer grain requisition and storage work, in order to protect the safety of grain transporters and livestock, cadres at various warehouses and grain stations voluntarily organized themselves to boil water and erect mat sheds for the grain-delivering masses to rest. They also set up temporary medical stations, invited doctors, and prepared first-aid medicines. They arranged parking locations for grain-transporting carts to prevent congestion and accidents. When inspecting grain, the depot cadres were amiable and adopted a patient and persuasive attitude. They prepared winnowing machines in advance, and for substandard grain, they mobilized the masses to sort or dry it on the spot. Generally, there were no cases of grain being rejected, avoiding the waste of manpower and animal power in repeated trips, which was supported by the grain-delivering masses. Gaoyi, Zanhuang, Gaocheng, and other counties praised these cadres.
    The above facts prove that the current rectification has played a considerable role for the majority of cadres. However, there are still a few departments that lack a sufficient understanding of the spirit of conducting rectification by summarizing and inspecting work. The scope of inspection is too broad, and many facts are presented, but the focus is not grasped. They are not good at deeply digging into the ideological roots of various errors and shortcomings, and they do not analyze problems from a principled standpoint, which has delayed the progress of the inspection. In addition, there are also individual departments that have not paid attention to the integration of rectification with current work, resulting in neglecting one thing while attending to another, and failing to achieve certain results. In order to correct these shortcomings and ensure the timely completion of the rectification plan, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee convened a meeting of branch secretaries of various agencies on the 22nd of this month to conduct an inspection, deciding to strengthen specific guidance and typical demonstrations to advance the rectification movement.

　　结合工作进行整风
    石家庄专区工作初步改进
    【本报讯】河北石家庄专区自七月初开始的整风，因为和当前工作密切结合，一个多月来，某些工作已有改进。如这次雨季护粮工作，专区粮库大多数干部均冒雨分赴各县检查仓库，发挥了高度的负责精神。该库刘秋发、刘杰二同志因河水暴涨，路上全是泥浆，不便乘车，就步行至栾城、正定检查。在他们这种模范行动的影响之下，下级干部也都积极行动起来。驻石家庄直属一库全体干部，发现库内小米发高热。为了防止霉烂，乘雨停时光，三十多个干部一齐动手，三个钟头内就疏散了三十多万斤粮食。二库的同志们连续三夜进行疏散工作，翻倒库存小米一百十余万斤，使温度散发，免去霉烂。此外，各县干部也表现了积极爱护国家财产的精神。灵寿县仓库杜主任、元氏县仓库翟主任、赵县仓库吕主任，都曾在大雨中进行修补房屋，检查仓库存放的粮食。
    经过了这一段整风学习，干部作风也有了很大的改进。在这次夏征入库工作中，为了保护运粮人、畜的安全各仓库和粮站干部自动组织起来给送粮群众烧开水、搭席棚，让群众休息。并设立临时医疗站，请医生，准备急救药品。布置运粮大车停放地点，不使发生拥挤和意外的事故。各库干部在检查粮食时，态度和蔼，采取耐心解释说服的态度。事前准备扇车，对不合标准的粮食，动员群众就地整理或晾晒，一般未曾发生退粮现象，避免了人力畜力往返的浪费，得到送粮群众的拥护。高邑、赞皇、藁城等县并提出表扬这些干部。
    上面事实证明，对多数干部来说，此次整风已发挥了相当的作用。但目前仍有少数部门，在整风过程中，对通过总结，检查工作进行整风的精神认识不足。检查面过广，提出了许多事实，但没有抓住中心，不善于深入挖掘各种错误与缺点的思想根源，没有提到原则上来分析问题，致使迟滞了检查进度。此外，也有个别部门因未注意整风必须与当前工作互相结合，因而顾此失彼，未能收到一定的效果。为了纠正这些缺点，保证整风计划的按时完成，本月二十二日，石家庄地委召集各机关支部书记会议，进行一次检查，决定加强具体指导、典型示范，把整风运动提高一步。
