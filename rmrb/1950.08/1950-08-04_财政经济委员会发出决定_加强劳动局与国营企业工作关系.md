　　The Financial and Economic Committee Issues Decision
    Strengthen Working Relationship Between Labor Bureau and State-Owned Enterprises
    (Xinhua News Agency, 28th) The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government recently issued a decision on the working relationship between the labor bureaus of provincial and municipal people's governments and local state-owned enterprises. The decision pointed out that the relationship between local labor bureaus and state-owned and public-owned production enterprises has lacked clear regulations in the past, resulting in insufficient closeness and affecting the further implementation of labor laws and regulations. Regarding the working relationship between the two, the decision specifically stipulates three points: (1) All state-owned and public-owned production enterprises in various regions should uniformly abide by and implement the various labor laws and regulations promulgated by the central and local governments, as well as the detailed implementation rules, decisions, and regulations issued by local labor bureaus based on these laws and regulations. If the local laws, regulations, etc., conflict with the regulations of the enterprise's higher-level leading organs, and the enterprise has difficulties in implementation, it should notify the local labor bureau and jointly request instructions from the higher-level leading organs for joint resolution. (2) Provincial and municipal labor bureaus have the right to supervise and inspect the implementation of labor policies and laws regarding labor protection, labor insurance, wage treatment, child labor and female workers, employment and dismissal, collective contracts, cultural education, etc., within state-owned and public-owned enterprises; the administrative side of each enterprise has the obligation to provide the aforementioned relevant information and report as required; inspection personnel dispatched by the labor bureau with valid credentials shall not be refused entry. Labor bureau inspection personnel should abide by the enterprise's confidentiality system. (3) Based on the inspection results, the labor bureau has the right to make suggestions to the enterprise for improving work; the administrative side of the enterprise should respect its suggestions and implement or explain them. If there is a dispute between the two parties, they should jointly report to the higher levels for resolution.
