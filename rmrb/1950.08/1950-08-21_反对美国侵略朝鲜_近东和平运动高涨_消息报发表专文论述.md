Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: According to TASS, Izvestia published an article by Osipov entitled "The Peace Movement in the Near East."

The article first points out: In the new world war prepared by the US-British imperialists, the Near Eastern countries have been assigned special tasks. This can be seen from the increasing militarization of Turkey and Iran, and the decision made at the London meeting of the US, British, and French foreign ministers in May to supply the Arab countries and Israel with military supplies. The US-British imperialists are attempting to turn the Near East into a base for aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

The article continues: This year, the political consciousness of the working people in the Near East and Middle East has increased, and the movement for peace has grown. In recent months, thousands of mass demonstrations and rallies, and many workers' strikes, have been held in Iran, Turkey, Israel, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and other Near Eastern countries to protest against the rule of US-British imperialism, the arms race and militaristic policies, the instigation of war psychology, and anti-communist hysteria. The American aggression against Korea has aroused a huge wave of protests in the Near East and Middle East.

The article describes the surge of the peace movement in the Near East, Middle East, and North Africa:

The movement to support peace is being carried out most actively in Syria and Lebanon. Many trade unions, youth, women, and other mass organizations have participated in the peace movement, and the Communist Party is at the forefront of the movement.

The people of Iran have collected 25,000 signatures for the Stockholm Appeal in a short period of time.

The Arab people of Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, and the French territories in North Africa are all enthusiastically supporting the peace movement. The latter's activities are being carried out under extremely difficult conditions, because the French authorities, under orders from Washington, are carrying out large-scale arrests of peace supporters in North Africa and Algeria. Thousands of patriots who are fighting for peace have been thrown into prison.

The article emphasizes: The US-British ruling clique is preparing to incorporate the Near East and Middle East countries—especially Turkey and Iran—into the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty system, because Turkey and Iran have the most manpower among the Middle Eastern countries and border the Soviet Union. However, this conspiracy has been resisted by the people of Turkey and Iran.

The article concludes: The ideal of peace has become very dear to the people of the vast areas of the Near East and Middle East. The US-British war-mongers cannot gain the support of the people of their Near Eastern colonial and dependent countries, because these people are unwilling to shed blood for Washington's atomic maniacs and its British and French servants.

### 反对美国侵略朝鲜  近东和平运动高涨  消息报发表专文论述

　　反对美国侵略朝鲜
    近东和平运动高涨
    消息报发表专文论述
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：消息报发表了奥希波夫所作题为《近东的和平运动》的论文。
    论文首先指出：在美英帝国主义者所准备的新世界战争中，近东各国被派定了特殊的任务。这可以从土耳其和伊朗日益军国主义化，和今年五月伦敦美、英、法三外长会议所作的供应各阿拉伯国家及以色列军火的决定中看出来。美英帝国主义者们企图将近东变为侵略苏联和各人民民主国家的基地。
    论文继称：在今年，近东和中东劳动人民的政治觉悟都提高了，争取和平的运动成长起来了。近数月来，在伊朗、土耳其、以色列、叙利亚、埃及、黎巴嫩和其他近东国家中，举行了好几千次群众示威游行和集会，和许多次工人罢工，以抗议美英帝国主义的统治、军备竞赛和军国主义的政策、煽动战争心理和反共的歇斯底里。美国侵略朝鲜已经激起了近东和中东各国巨大的抗议浪潮。
    论文叙述近东、中东和北非各国和平运动的高涨情况称：
    拥护和平的运动在叙利亚和黎巴嫩两国进行得最为积极，许多工会、青年、妇女及其他群众组织都参加了和平运动，而共产党则走在运动的最前列。
    伊朗人民在短期内已为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集了二万五千人的签名。
    埃及、苏丹、伊拉克以及法国在北非属地的阿拉伯人民都热烈支持和平运动。后者的活动是在极艰苦的条件下进行的，因为法国当局在华盛顿的命令下，正大肆拘捕北非和阿尔及利亚的和平拥护者，数以千计的为和平而斗争的爱国分子已被投入狱中。
    论文着重指出：美英统治集团准备把近东和中东各国——特别是土耳其和伊朗——并入侵略性的北大西洋公约体系内，因土伊两国在中东国家中拥有最多的人力，又与苏联接壤。但这种阴谋已遭到土耳其和伊朗人民的反抗。
    论文结语称：和平的理想已对近东、中东广大地区的人民非常亲切了。美英战争贩子不能获得他们近东的殖民国家与附属国家的人民的支持，因为这些人民不愿为华盛顿的原子狂者和它的英法仆从而流血。
