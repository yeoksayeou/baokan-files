Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 17th (via TASS): The United States' intensified war preparations in West Germany have spurred the German people to further develop the movement for peace and against war.

According to statistics from the Munich Peace Committee, over 400,000 people in the American-occupied state of Bavaria have now signed the peace appeal. In mid-July, the number of signatories in the state was only 260,000.

Meanwhile, the Nuremberg Peace Committee in the American zone, representing 62,000 members, recently issued a declaration calling on all German people to demand a halt to war preparations in the Western occupied zones of Germany. The declaration calls on the German people to establish peace committees in various enterprises to supervise work for peace, refuse to manufacture armaments, and refuse to be used as cannon fodder for foreign interests.

    【新华社十八日讯】综合塔斯社柏林十七日消息：美国帝国主义在西德加紧备战的措施，已激起德国人民进一步展开争取和平、反对战争的运动。
    据慕尼黑和平委员会统计：在美占区巴伐利亚州，目前已有四十余万人参加了和平签名。而在七月中旬，该州签名人数尚仅为二十六万人。
    同时，美占区纽伦堡和平委员会也代表该会六万二千名会员于最近发表宣言，号召全德人民要求停止在德境西方占领区进行战争准备。宣言号召德国人民在各企业中设立和平委员会，以便监督为和平而工作，拒绝制造军火，拒绝被人利用来为外国利益而去充当炮灰。
