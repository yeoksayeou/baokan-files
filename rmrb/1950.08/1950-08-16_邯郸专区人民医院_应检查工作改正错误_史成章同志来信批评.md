　　邯郸 Special District People's Hospital
    Should Examine Work and Correct Errors
    Comrade Shi Chengzhang's Letter of Criticism
　　Editor Comrade:
    The Handan Special District People's Hospital (located in Handan Town), due to the bureaucratic work style of its leadership and a lack of political education for its medical staff, most doctors and nurses lack a perspective of serving the people and are extremely irresponsible towards patients. Errors occur repeatedly in medical work, which seriously endangers the lives of patients.
    On June 2nd, a woman from Zhangzhuangqiao Village, eight miles from Handan Town, had a difficult labor and went to the People's Hospital to ask for an obstetrician. However, the hospital's Director Wang emphasized that he was busy and refused to send a doctor. After much pleading, he finally suggested that the patient hire a rickshaw. However, rickshaws were scarce in Handan Town and difficult to find immediately, so Director Wang only sent a nurse. When the nurse arrived, the patient's condition was already very serious due to the delay, and the nurse's medical skills were poor, resulting in the patient's death.
    Comrade Hao Baoquan of the Handan Federation of Trade Unions went to the hospital for treatment. The doctor did not make a thorough diagnosis and prescribed medicine for typhoid fever. However, after two months of treatment, the illness worsened. After a re-diagnosis, it was determined to be heart disease. But Comrade Hao eventually died because of taking the wrong medicine, which aggravated his condition.
    A woman from Wu'an County went to the hospital to treat sores. When the hospital gave her an injection, they accidentally injected it outside the blood vessel. As a result, the injection site ulcerated into a sore.
    In mid-March, a worker named Zhu Dianxi broke his arm and went to the hospital for treatment. The hospital only wrapped his arm with white cloth and performed surgery three days later. By this time, Zhu Dianxi's injury was severely swollen, and they said that the injury could not be cured. Zhu Dianxi had no choice but to seek treatment from another doctor, who soon cured him.
    Secondly, the hospital disregards the actual situation of patients and mechanically emphasizes the system. Seriously ill patients who arrive at the hospital often do not receive timely treatment because it is not during working hours. At the end of the fifth month of the old lunar calendar this year, a person selling food on the train had his leg crushed by the train and was carried to the hospital for treatment. Because it was not working hours, the patient waited in the hospital for more than two hours without anyone attending to him and died.
    In addition, the hospital pays very little attention to hygiene. The hospital ward has a large room with dozens of people, and the hospital allows patients with infectious diseases to live with ordinary patients. At the end of June, a patient with third-stage lung disease was allowed to live in the large ward. Patients' bedpans are often not cleaned, so the air in the ward is very bad. Hospital staff often wash dirty clothes in the patients' dining room, making the dining room very dirty. The hospital toilets have not been emptied or cleaned for a long time, making them reek of foul odor.
    The above situation has not attracted the attention of the hospital leadership. The hospital leadership usually does not pay attention to the education of medical staff. They do not criticize staff who make mistakes, and they do not praise the few cadres who work hard and are actively responsible. Therefore, a phenomenon of unclear rewards and punishments has formed.
    Last summer, the Handan Special Commissioner's Office held a meeting in which relevant agencies and organizations made many suggestions to the hospital. However, the hospital did not improve its work based on these suggestions.
    I suggest that the hospital leadership should deeply examine the shortcomings and errors in past work, strengthen the education of medical staff, and improve work. Medical staff who neglect the interests of patients and cause patients to die due to negligence should be given appropriate punishment to ensure the safety of patients' lives.

　　邯郸专区人民医院
    应检查工作改正错误
    史成章同志来信批评
　　编者同志：
    邯郸专区人民医院（设在邯郸镇），由于领导上的官僚主义作风，对医护人员缺乏政治教育，大部分医生、护士都缺乏为人民服务的观点，对病人极不负责，在医疗工作中屡次发生错误，以致严重地危害了病人的生命。
    六月二日，距邯郸镇八里的张庄桥村有一个妇女难产，到人民医院去请产科医生。但该院王院长却强调工作忙，不肯派医生。说了半天好话，他才提出要病人家雇人力车。但邯郸镇人力车少，一时难于找到，王院长就只派了一个看护去。当看护到达时，病人因为耽误过久，病势已经很重，而护士的医疗技术又差，结果病人就死了。
    邯郸总工会郝保全同志到该院治病，医生没有经过很好诊断，就按伤寒病下药。但治了两个月，病势却愈来愈重了。经复诊后，才断定是心脏病。但郝同志终因吃错了药，病势加重，死去了。
    武安县有一个妇女，到该院去治疮。该院替她打针时，不小心把针打在血管外边。结果，打针处溃烂成疮。
    三月中旬，工人朱殿喜胳膊折伤，到该院治疗。该院只把他胳膊用白布包住，过了三天才动手术。这时朱殿喜的伤处肿得很厉害，他们竟说这伤治不好了。朱殿喜没法，就另请医生去治，不久就治好了。
    其次，该院不顾病人实际情况，机械地强调制度。重病者到该院时，常因不是工作时间而得不到及时的治疗。今年旧历五月底，有一个在火车上卖饭的被火车轧断了腿，被抬到该院治疗。因当时不是工作时间，病人在医院里等了两个多钟点而没人管，就死了。
    此外，该院对卫生工作也非常不注意。该院的病房有一大间屋住几十个人，而院方竟让传染病人和普通病人住在一起，六月底，还让一个第三期肺病患者住在大病房中。病人的便壶经常不刷洗，因此病房中空气很不好。医院职工常在病员饭厅内洗脏衣服，把饭厅弄得很脏。该院厕所长期不掏粪，不打扫，弄得臭气薰人。
    以上情况，并没有引起该院领导上的注意。该院领导上对于医护人员，平时不注意教育。对犯了错误的工作人员也不展开批评；而对少数埋头苦干、积极负责的干部也不表扬。因此，形成赏罚不明的现象。
    去年夏季，邯郸专署曾召开过一次会议，由各有关机关团体向该院提了很多意见。但该院并没有根据这些意见来改进工作。
    我建议该院领导上应深刻检讨过去工作中的缺点和错误，加强对医护人员的教育，以改进工作。对某些忽视病人利益，因过失而使病人死亡的医护人员，给以适当的处分，以保障病人的生命安全。
