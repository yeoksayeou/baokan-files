Xinhua News Agency, August 1st—Speech by Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, at the Beijing People's Celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day and Demonstration Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea:

Comrades!

Today, as we happily celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army on "August 1st," I extend my sincerest wishes to the great leader Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters, and pay them the highest respect!

Thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in these 23 years of arduous struggle, with its unparalleled strength, defeated the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, expelled the imperialism that had exploited the Chinese people for more than a century, and destroyed the feudal rule that had oppressed the Chinese people for more than two thousand years, enabling the Chinese people to establish their own regime and laying the foundation for people's democracy. This "August 1st" anniversary is not only a glorious day in the history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but also the most magnificent and glorious day in the history of the Chinese nation!

The People's Liberation Army has achieved such great and brilliant accomplishments because: (1) It has the correct leadership of Chairman Mao; (2) It has Marxism-Leninism, this universal truth, as its guiding principle; (3) It is the army of the people, with iron discipline and a spirit of serving the people. In the year from last year's "August 1st" to this year's "August 1st," in addition to its brilliant achievements in battle, it has also engaged in labor production, strengthened learning, and improved its cultural level. This progressive and powerful people's armed force is not only China's bastion of peace, but, in its fraternal alliance with the Soviet people, has indeed become a strong bastion of peace in the Far East and even the world!

The American imperialists want to follow in Hitler's footsteps, launch wars, and annex the whole world. Recently, while frantically carrying out armed aggression against Korea, they have also dispatched their Pacific Seventh Fleet in a vain attempt to prevent our country from liberating Taiwan. We firmly believe that with such a strong and unparalleled People's Liberation Army, which was able to drive American imperialism out of mainland China in the past, it is of course certain that it will be able to drive American imperialism out of Taiwan and also, together with the Korean people and the people of oppressed nations in Asia, drive American imperialism out of Asia!

Comrades! Defending the country and safeguarding peace is the responsibility of every Chinese person. Let us rise up and watch out for American imperialism, this aggressor! We must unite even more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, and with this united strength, defend our homeland, liberate Taiwan and Tibet, aid the Korean people, and overthrow imperialism!

    许德珩的演说
    【新华社一日讯】九三学社主席许德珩在北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会上的演说：同胞们！
    今天，欣逢人民解放军“八一”建军二十三周年的纪念日子，我以最诚挚的心情向伟大的领导者毛主席、朱总司令及全体指挥员战斗员致最崇高的敬礼！
    由于毛主席朱总司令之正确的领导，中国人民解放军在这二十三年的艰苦斗争中，以坚强无比的力量打垮了蒋介石匪帮的反动统治，驱逐了剥削中国人民一百多年的帝国主义摧毁了压迫中国人民二千多年的封建统治使中国人民达到了建立自己的政权，奠定了人民民主的基础，这“八一”的纪念节日，不仅仅是中国人民解放军历史上的光荣日子，而且是中华民族史上，最伟大最光荣的日子！
    人民解放军之有这样伟大光辉的成绩。因为：（一）它有毛主席的正确领导；（二）它有马列主义这个普遍真理做它的指导原则；（三）它是人民的军队，有钢铁般的纪律与为人民服务的精神。在从去年“八一”到今年“八一”这一年之中，于辉煌的战绩以外，并还从事劳动生产，加强学习，提高自己的文化水准。这支进步的强大的人民武力，不只是中国的和平堡垒，在与苏联人民兄弟般结合的现时，确已经成为远东乃至世界坚强的和平堡垒！
    美帝国主义者要想步希特勒的后尘，发动战争，吞并全世界，最近于与疯狂的武装侵略朝鲜同时，还派遣它的太平洋第七舰队妄图阻止我国解放台湾，我们坚决的相信以这样坚强无比的人民解放军，过去既能把美帝驱逐出中国大陆，现在当然的也一定的能够把美帝驱逐出台湾并还能与朝鲜人民及亚洲被压迫民族人民一致，把美帝驱逐出亚洲以外去！
    同胞们！捍卫国家保卫和平是我们每一个中国人民的责任，我们起来，注视美帝这个侵略者！我们更要团结起来，团结在中国共产党及人民解放军的周围，以这种团结的力量保卫国土；解放台湾，西藏；援助朝鲜人民；打倒帝国主义！
