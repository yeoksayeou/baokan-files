　　Improving Trade, Taxation, Factories, and Trade Union Work
    Heilongjiang Trains Urban Work Cadres
    7,000 People to Participate in Studies Sequentially
    [Our Heilongjiang News] In order to improve the policy and ideological level of urban work cadres and rectify the work style of cadres, Heilongjiang Province is taking advantage of the summer hoeing period to train trade, taxation, factory, and trade union work cadres on a large scale. This province has many small commercial cities, and urban work has expanded rapidly in recent years, absorbing a large number of new cadres. However, due to the heavy workload, there is little time for rectification and education. Therefore, in urban work, especially among trade and taxation work cadres, there are some rather common erroneous ideas and undesirable work styles. For example, some cadres working in state-owned stores and cooperatives do not fully recognize the importance of financial and economic work, have vague policy ideas, feel that they have become "businessmen" and "counter legs," and feel that they have "no future." Therefore, they are not content with their work and want to switch to government departments. Some cadres are not active in their work, adopting a "one day monk, one day bell-ringing" attitude; they do not cherish state property and have a bad attitude towards the masses. There are also individualistic phenomena such as competing for salaries, positions, and making trouble. Among taxation cadres, there is a style of coercion and command; some even disregard policies and arbitrarily apportion taxes, resulting in uneven tax burdens. A few even cultivate personal relationships, engage in corruption and embezzlement. In order to overcome these shortcomings and improve the policy and ideological level of cadres, the province has decided to take advantage of the summer hoeing period to run training classes for urban workers at the provincial and county levels, and to train trade, taxation, factory, and trade union work cadres in batches. Cadres above the section chief level will be trained by the province, and general cadres will be trained by the counties. In general counties, the focus will be on trade and taxation cadres, while in Hailun, Suihua, and four other counties, trade, taxation, factory, and trade union cadres will be given equal emphasis. It is estimated that large counties will conduct four training sessions, and small counties will conduct two training sessions. A total of more than 7,000 cadres can be trained, accounting for more than half of the existing staff, shop assistants, section members, and staff members in the above-mentioned departments. The training content will focus on policy education and ideological education, based on the Common Program, the reports of Chen Yun and Bo Yibo, the deputy directors of the Central Finance and Economics Committee, at the Second Plenary Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC, "To Whom Does Honor Belong?" "Oppose Liberalism," and relevant editorials in this newspaper. The training will combine specific situations, conduct lectures and discussions, and further connect with the working principles of small and medium-sized cities in the province. In the spirit of rectification, work will be reviewed, and criticism and self-criticism will be carried out to overcome erroneous ideas and establish a correct outlook on life and work style. At the same time, trainees will be mobilized to put forward suggestions for improving overall work based on the spirit of the policies, and to expose certain bureaucratic work styles of leading cadres from the bottom up.
    The training classes piloted by the province in Keshan, Hailun, and Anda counties have concluded around June 20, lasting half a month. Subsequently, the province convened a meeting of training class directors from various counties to exchange experiences and deploy the work of the province's cadre training classes. Around July 5, urban worker training classes in 36 counties, excluding Heihe Prefecture, had begun, with a total of 2,506 trainees currently undergoing training.

　　改进贸易税收工厂和工会工作
    黑龙江训练城市工作干部
    将有七千人先后参加学习
    【本报黑龙江讯】黑龙江省为提高城市工作干部的政策、思想水平，整顿干部作风，利用夏锄期间，大规模地训练贸易、税收、工厂和工会工作干部。该省多商业性的小城市，近年来城市工作迅速扩展，吸收了大量新干部，又因事务繁忙，很少有时间进行整训教育。因之，在城市工作，特别是贸易、税收工作干部中，相当普遍地存在着一些错误思想和不良作风。如某些在国营商店和合作社工作的干部，对财经工作的重要性认识不足，政策思想模糊，认为是当了“买卖人”、“柜腿”，感到“没有出息”，因之不安心工作，想改行到政权部门去。有的干部工作不积极，抱着“当一天和尚撞一天钟”的态度；对国家财产不爱护，对群众的态度不好。还有争薪分、争地位、闹情绪等个人主义的现象。税收干部中则存在着强迫命令作风，有的更不讲政策，随便摊派，造成税收上的畸轻畸重；个别的甚至拉拢私人关系，贪污腐化。为克服这些缺点，提高干部的政策、思想水平，该省特决定利用夏锄期间，由省、县分别开办城市工作人员训练班，分批调训贸易、税收、工厂和工会工作干部。科长以上由省训练，一般干部由各县训练。一般县以贸易、税收干部为主，海伦、绥化等六县则贸易、税收与工厂、工会干部并重。预计大县训练四期，小县训练两期。共可训练干部七千余人，占上述各部门现有职员、店员和科员、干事的一半以上。训练内容以政策教育和思想教育为主，以共同纲领，中央财经委员会陈云、薄一波正副主任在政协全国委员会第二届全体会议上的报告，“荣誉是属于谁的”，“反对自由主义”以及本报有关社论为根据，结合具体情况，进行讲解讨论，并进一步联系该省中、小城市的工作方针，以整风的精神检查工作，开展批评与自我批评，以克服错误思想，建立正确的人生观和工作作风。同时，并发动学员根据政策的精神，对全面工作提出改进意见，并自下而上地揭发领导干部的某些官僚主义作风。
    现该省在克山、海伦、安达三县试办的训练班已在六月二十日前后结束，历时半月。接着该省又召开了各县训练班主任会议，交流经验，布置了全省干部训练班工作。七月五日前后，除黑河专区外，三十六个县的城市工作人员训练班都已开始，正在受训的学员共有二千五百零六名。
