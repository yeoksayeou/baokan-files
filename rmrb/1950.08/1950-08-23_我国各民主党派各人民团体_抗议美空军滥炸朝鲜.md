Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd:

　　All democratic parties and people's organizations in China today issued a protest against the U.S. Air Force's indiscriminate bombing of Korea. The full text is as follows:

    The U.S. government, because its ground forces invading Korea have suffered defeats, is using its air force to carry out extremely barbaric bombing of peaceful residents in Korean cities and rural areas. Many bombed cities and rural areas, as well as cultural institutions such as hospitals and schools, have been razed to the ground, and the people have suffered massacres on a large scale. According to U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Stratemeyer, on August 15th, the U.S. Air Force dropped more than 7,000 tons of bombs in one month. And on the 16th alone, about 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped on the west bank of the Rakdong River. As early as the beginning of August, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had lodged a serious protest with the United Nations Security Council against the U.S. Air Force's atrocities. Soviet representative Malik proposed a motion on August 8th to stop the U.S. Air Force's atrocities, but because the U.S. government manipulated the Security Council's majority to obstruct the meeting, this motion has not yet been voted on.

    All democratic parties and people's organizations in China resolutely protest against the U.S. Air Force's barbaric bombing, as well as the indulgence and cooperation of the majority of countries in the Security Council under U.S. manipulation towards this barbaric bombing. We believe that this bombing is a complete violation of the United Nations Charter and all international laws, and is a complete violation of humanitarianism. The U.S. Air Force's barbaric bombing of Korea, and the U.S. military's barbaric acts of creating no-man's-lands in Korea, prove that the U.S. government and its followers have no sympathy for the people of either North or South Korea, and prove that they are bloodthirsty invaders. Their purpose is not, as they fabricated, to save the Korean people, but to destroy the Korean people and establish an aggressive base in Korea where they can do whatever they want.

    We urgently appeal to all people with human sympathy throughout the world to rise up together to stop the U.S. Air Force's inhuman atrocities, and demand that the Security Council quickly pass the Soviet representative's humanitarian proposal of August 8th.

　　我国各民主党派各人民团体
    抗议美空军滥炸朝鲜
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国各民主党派和各人民团体本日对美国空军滥炸朝鲜一事发表抗议，全文如下：
    美国政府因为自己的侵略朝鲜的地面部队遭受失败，竟用空军向朝鲜城市农村的和平居民普遍地施行极野蛮的轰炸。许多被轰炸的城市农村及其医院、学校等文化机关已夷为平地，人民遭受大规模的屠杀。据美国远东航空队司令斯特拉特梅耶在八月十五日宣布，美国空军在一个月中竟投弹七千余吨。而在十六日一天，又在洛东江西岸投弹约千吨。早在八月初旬，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已对美国空军暴行向联合国安全理事会提出严重抗议。苏联代表马立克在八月八日即提出制止美国空军暴行的提案，但因美国政府操纵安全理事会的多数阻挠会议的进行，这个提案至今尚未表决。
    中国各民主党派和各人民团体坚决抗议美国空军的这种野蛮的轰炸，以及在美国操纵下的安全理事会多数国家对于这种野蛮轰炸的放纵和合作。我们认为这种轰炸完全违背联合国宪章和一切国际公法，并且完全违背人道。美国空军对于朝鲜的野蛮轰炸，以及美军在朝鲜制造无人区的野蛮行为，证明了美国政府及其追随者对于无论朝鲜北部或南部的人民都没有丝毫的同情心，证明了他们是杀人不眨眼的侵略者。他们的目的完全不是如他们所捏造的什么拯救朝鲜人民，相反地，是要毁灭朝鲜人民，是要在朝鲜建立起他们可以为所欲为的侵略基地。
    我们迫切地呼吁全世界一切具有人类同情心的人们，共同奋起，制止美国空军的灭绝人性的暴行，并要求安全理事会迅速通过苏联代表八月八日的人道提案。
