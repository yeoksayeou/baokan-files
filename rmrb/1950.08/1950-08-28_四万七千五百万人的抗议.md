　　A Protest of 475 Million People
    On August 27th, American aircraft repeatedly intruded into our country's Northeast airspace and strafed Linjiang, Andong, and other places, resulting in the deaths of three of our compatriots and injuries to twenty-one. American imperialism's history of aggression against China has thus added another debt of blood!
    Our Central People's Government Foreign Minister Zhou has already lodged a serious protest with U.S. Secretary of State Acheson regarding this, demanding that the U.S. government punish the perpetrators and provide compensation. At the same time, a telegram has been sent to the UN Security Council, requesting that the Security Council immediately stop this provocation and violence by the American troops invading Korea. This represents the righteous voice of China's 475 million people!
    The provocation of American aircraft proves that the American aggressors are expanding their armed aggression in Korea and our country's territory of Taiwan, and further proves that all the statements made by the American government and its representatives in the Security Council, claiming that the United States has not carried out aggression, are complete "outright lies." All Chinese people must be vigilant and rise up in unison, must unanimously resist the American military's acts of aggression against our country's Taiwan and Northeast regions, and must unanimously support the righteous struggle of the Central People's Government. The hundreds of millions of Chinese people, united as one, will absolutely not allow the American aggressors to run rampant in our country's airspace, territorial waters, and territory. American aggressors who dare to provoke us must bear the consequences of their actions!

　　四万七千五百万人的抗议
    美国飞机在八月二十七日多次侵入我国东北领空，并在临江、安东等地扫射，使我国同胞死三人，伤二十一人。美国帝国主义对于中国的侵略史，从此又增加了一笔血债！
    我国中央人民政府周外长已经为此向美国国务卿艾奇逊提出严重的抗议，要求美国政府惩凶赔偿，同时致电联合国安理会，要求安理会立即制止美国侵略朝鲜军队的这种挑衅和暴行。这是代表了中国四万七千五百万人的正义的呼声！
    美国飞机的挑衅，证明美国侵略者正在扩大在朝鲜和我国领土台湾的武装侵略，并且进一步证明美国政府及其在安理会的代表关于美国并未实行侵略的全部言论完全是“漫天大谎”。全中国人民必须一致警惕和奋起，必须一致反抗美国军队对于我国台湾东北两地的侵略行为，必须一致拥护中央人民政府的正义斗争。团结起来的几万万中国人民，绝对不允许美国侵略者在我国领空领海领土横行，敢于挑衅的美国侵略者必须自食其果！
