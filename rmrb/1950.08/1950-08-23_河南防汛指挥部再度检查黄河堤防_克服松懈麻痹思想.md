Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng: The Yellow River's major flood season has arrived. The Henan Provincial Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters recently re-inspected the Yellow River flood control preparations. Niu Peicong, Vice Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government and Director of the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, Zhao Mingfu, Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and others, visited the Kaifeng, Zhongmu, and Zheng (zhou) Cheng (gao) Yellow River repair sections and dangerous areas such as Liuyuankou and Huayuankou. All other counties along the Yellow River also held temporary grand reviews of flood control teams.

According to the results of this inspection, the current flood control preparations in the Henan section of the Yellow River, with the exception of the Zhongmu County section which is relatively good, generally have shortcomings to varying degrees in other county sections, such as a lack of close contact between upstream and downstream, a lack of in-depth flood control organization, complacency among some people and cadres, insufficiently solid levees, and incomplete preparation of flood control tools.

After the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters pointed out the above shortcomings, the counties and sections along the river are now stepping up various flood control preparations.

　　河南防汛指挥部再度检查黄河堤防
    克服松懈麻痹思想
    【本报讯】据新华社开封电：黄河大汛期已到，河南省黄河防汛指挥部最近再度检查黄河防汛准备工作。该省人民政府副主席、省防汛指挥部主任牛佩琮、黄河水利委员会主任赵明甫等，曾到开封、中牟、郑（州）成（皐）等黄河修防段及柳园口、花园口等险口处视察。沿黄河其他各县也都临时分别举行了防汛队大检阅。
    根据此次检查的结果，目前黄河河南省段的防汛准备工作除中牟县段较好以外，一般县段都或多或少地存在着上下游联系不密切，防汛组织不深入，部分群众和干部思想麻痹，堤线不够坚固及防汛工具准备不齐全等缺点。
    以上缺点，经该省防汛指挥部指出后，沿河各县段现正加紧进行各项防汛准备工作。
