　　Field Selection vs. On-Farm Selection
　　Wang Xun
　　My family has put a lot of effort into seed selection, using both on-farm selection and field selection methods. I would like to share my experiences and gains from using these two methods over the years.
　　On-Farm Selection Method: Initially, whether it was sorghum, cotton, or wheat seed selection, we all used the on-farm selection method. As we know, crops grow with varying degrees of vigor; some are diseased, and some are healthy, with each plant being different. Once piled on the threshing ground, the diseased and healthy plants mix together, and the healthy seeds also become contaminated with disease. After years of trying on-farm selection, we never achieved the goal of fewer diseased plants and higher yields. Furthermore, we experienced a severe outbreak of smut disease. Due to the occurrence of smut, wheat production decreased by 10%, with a yield of only 225 jin per mu. In contrast, the fields without seed selection yielded 250 jin per mu. This was the result of our on-farm selection. After learning this lesson, we abandoned on-farm selection and tried the field selection method.
　　Field Selection Method: The field selection method was first implemented in 1941, using two approaches:
　　The first method is whole-field selection (or regional selection). The selection process is divided into three stages: (1) In the area reserved for seed production, before the crops head, go to the field to remove diseased or pest-damaged plants; (2) After heading, remove the remaining diseased plants from the first selection; (3) At harvest time, remove weak plants or those suspected of being diseased, including the roots. Cut off the heads of late-maturing and early-maturing plants. The remaining well-growing plants are used as breeding material (single threshing). After two years of continuous selection using this method, the seeds became purer than before, and disease incidence decreased. However, because the selection was not careful enough, with children participating in the selection work, smut was not completely eradicated, with approximately 0.5% of plants still affected by smut. There were also a small number of red kernels in the white wheat seeds, so we later tried the head-selection method.
　　The second method is head selection: Head selection was first implemented in 1943. The selection was more rigorous than whole-field selection. The main criteria were: 1. vigorous growth; 2. uniform maturity; 3. absence of disease and insect damage. Based on these criteria, the head selection saves two steps compared to whole-field selection, only requiring selection of heads one by one in the field when the crops are mature. Any heads near diseased plants are discarded. The selected heads are placed in pockets (to avoid the spread of smut spores, pockets are used instead of baskets). To prevent fungal infections, they are threshed separately indoors and stored separately. In the third year of implementing head selection (1945), production increased. The highest yield was 450 jin per mu, with an average of 350 jin per mu, which was 60 jin per mu more than the fields without seed selection (with the same soil quality and other conditions). Smut was almost completely eradicated.

　　场上选种与田间选种
    王迅
    我家在选种工作上下过不少工夫，用过场上选种，也用过田间选种，我把这些年来试用两种选种法的收获介绍一下。
    场上选种法：最初不论是高粱选种、棉花选种或者是小麦选种，都用的是场上选种法。我们知道，庄稼长得有肥有瘦，有的有病，有的没病，棵棵各不相同。堆到场上后，有病和无病的就混起来了，没病的粒子也粘染上了病。场上选种，试了多年，终没有达到病株少、收成多的目的，并且发生过一次严重的黑穗病。因黑穗病的发生，麦子的产量减收了百分之十，每亩地只收二百二十五市斤，没选种的田内反收到二百五十斤。这是我们场上选种的结果。得到这个教训后，舍弃了场上选种，试行了田间选种的方法。
    田间选种法：田间选种法，是一九四一年开始试行的，采用的方法有两种：
    第一种是全田选种（或叫区域选种），选的过程共分三次：（一）在预备留着做种的区域里，在庄稼抽穗前，到田里去拔除病株或受过虫害的株；（二）出穗后拔除第一次剩下的病株；（三）将收割的时候，将生长瘦弱、有病害嫌疑的株连根拔去；成熟迟和成熟早的只把穗剪去；余下的生长好的作为品种用（单打）。这样我们连续选了两年，种子比以前纯了，病害也减少了。但因选时不够认真，有小孩子参加选种工作，黑穗病仍然没绝种，还有约百分之零点五的黑穗病；白麦种中还有少数的红粒，因此后来又试行了穗选法。
    第二是穗选法：穗选法是一九四三年试行的，选时比全田选种严格，主要的条件：一、生长健壮；二、成熟齐一；三、没有病害和虫蚀。根据这几个条件选，比全田选省去两道手续，只是在庄稼成熟时到田间一穗一穗的选。凡是四周有病株的就不要。选中的穗放在口袋里（为了避免黑穗病菌飞上，所以用口袋不用篮子）。为了防止菌类传染，拿回去在屋内单打，并单藏起来。在实行选穗的第三年（一九四五年），产量增加，一亩地最高产量四百五十市斤，平均每亩三百五十斤，比不选种的田里（地的土质和其他条件相同）每亩地多收六十斤。黑穗病几乎绝迹。
