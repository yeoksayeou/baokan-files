To the Editor of "The Story of a Letter":

　　Around late March, we set off to dig the river and build dikes in the lower reaches of the Chaobai River. Comrade Chen Mao, a soldier from the First Squad of the Second Company of a certain artillery battalion, who was stationed in the rear to carry out agricultural production, sent his first letter on March 28th to the comrades at the front to exchange production experiences, expressing his love and concern for them. However, because Comrade Chen Mao had just started learning literacy, he did not write the recipient's address clearly: not only did he not write the province, but he also wrote the "河" (He - River) in "河北省三河县" (Hebei Province, Sanhe County) as "合" (He - Combine). As a result, this letter, along with our comrades who are loyal to the people's postal service, began to circulate throughout the country. It was sent from Beijing Bureau 12 on April 1st, and reached Sanhe County, Hebei Province on April 2nd. The Sanhe County Post Office, seeing that it was not Sanhe County but "Sanhe County" (三合县), conveniently added a note on April 7th and returned it to Sanhe in Guangzhou. The Guangzhou Sanhe Post Office, after receiving it, could not find Gaotuo Village, so it added another note on April 21st and returned it to Guizhou. Also because there was a Sanhe County but no Gaotuo Village, the Guizhou Sanhe Post Office added a note as usual and returned it to Sanhe in Sichuan on May 29th. However, the Sichuan Sanhe Post Office still could not deliver it. Finally, the letter was returned to Beijing Bureau 12 and safely returned to our battalion on July 5th.

　　This seems like a trivial matter not worth writing about. But in reality, it is indeed a very extraordinary matter. Everyone can think about it; if in the old society during the Kuomintang's rule, would such a plain letter with an unclear address have passed through four provinces in a hundred days and finally returned to your hands? This incident also educated the soldiers: how important it is to learn literacy! One soldier said: "Improving our literacy is really a major event! One wrong ‘河’ (He - River) character caused the postal comrades to spend so much extra effort! They travelled so much extra distance!"

### 一封信的故事

　　一封信的故事编者同志：
    三月下旬某日，我们出发到潮白河下游去挖河筑堤，留守后方进行农业生产的某炮兵营二连一班战士陈懋同志，为了表示对前方同志们的热爱与关怀，曾于三月二十八日，发出了自己亲笔写的第一封向前方交换生产经验的信。但由于陈懋同志才开始学习文化，没把收信人的地址写清楚：不但没写省份，而且把河北省三河县的“河”字写成“合”字了。因此这封信就随着我们的忠实于人民邮政事业的同志们，开始在全国范围内转起来。四月一号由北京十二局发出，四月二号此信即达到河北省三河县。三河县邮局见不是三河县而是“三合县”，便于四月七日加批退转广州三合。广州三合邮局收到后，因找不到高坨村，便又加批于四月二十一日退转贵州。也因有三合县而没有高坨村，贵州三合邮局便照例加批，于五月二十九日退转了四川三合。可是四川三合邮局仍无法投交。最后该信退回了北京十二局，于七月五日已安全退回本营。
    这好像是一件不值一写的平凡小事。但实际上，确是一件极不平凡的大事。大家可以想想；假使在旧社会国民党统治时代，这样一封地址不明的平信，会在一百天里经过四个省最后又转到你的手里吗？这一件事也教育了战士们：学习文化是何等的重要！有一个战士说：“提高文化可真是一件大事啦、错了一个‘河’字，让邮局同志们多费了多少手续呀！多走了多少路哇！”
