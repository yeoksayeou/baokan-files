Remembering the Growth of Mountain Hospitals
    ——The Great Achievements of Medical Workers in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region During the Anti-Japanese War

　　In the autumn of 1937, after the Pingxingguan battle, a unit of the Liberation Army, led by General Nie Rongzhen, advanced into the enemy's rear, establishing the Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-Japanese Base Area with the North Yue region as its foundation; and also established the people's own hospitals. The Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940 inflicted severe losses on the enemy. Consequently, the Japanese invaders spared no effort in deploying a large number of troops to deal with us, implementing a blockade on one hand and brutally carrying out their "Three Alls" policy of "burn all, kill all, loot all" everywhere. At this time, in order to ensure the safe treatment of the wounded and sick and to strive for victory against the "mopping-up" operations, our hospitals dispersed and moved into the deep mountains.

　　On the rugged mountain roads, doctors and nurses, in addition to carrying their own belongings and medical equipment, also participated in carrying stretchers and backs of the wounded. This situation greatly moved the lightly wounded and sick, who all climbed down from the stretchers and walked on their own. Sometimes, during the transfer, they were attacked by the enemy, and the medical staff and some of the lightly wounded would pick up weapons to snipe at the enemy, covering the safe transfer of the wounded. Medical personnel often sacrificed themselves to protect the wounded. Comrade Wang Yunhua was an excellent Communist Party member. On one occasion, she was transferring with more than twenty wounded when they encountered the enemy. In order to cover the retreat of the wounded, she was surrounded by the enemy and fought valiantly. When the bullets ran out, she used stones as weapons. Finally, the enemy rushed up. But she did not yield, shouting "Long live the Communist Party" and gloriously sacrificed herself.

　　The enemy's "mopping-up" operations were long-term, but the wounded and sick could not be without treatment for a single day. Therefore, the medical staff extensively contacted local governments, closely cooperated with the masses and guerrilla groups, took turns on sentry duty, scouted enemy situations, erected intelligence poles on the mountain tops, and laid landmines and stone mines on roads where the enemy might pass. They established sickrooms in the mountain villages, settled the wounded comfortably, and whenever they had time, they went to the mountains to collect firewood and grind flour to improve the food for the wounded. In order to cope with the enemy's frantic searches, they also dug "terraced sickrooms" on the high mountainsides, and climbed all over the cliffs and steep walls to find caves, which they arranged so that these mountain caves, which no one had ever visited before, became safe treatment places. Every day, the medical staff carried medicine bags to various caves and "terraced sickrooms" to make rounds, deliver water and food, and at the same time explain victory news and domestic and foreign news to the wounded and sick.

　　The enemy searched the mountains. The medical staff circled around with the enemy during the day, and at night they had to secretly climb back and forth across the mountains to change dressings for the wounded and deliver water and food. They disregarded all difficulties, with only one belief in their hearts: "It doesn't matter if we are tired, but we can't let the wounded suffer." Sometimes, when the grain ran out, they risked going near the enemy's strongholds to carry it back. Sometimes, fearing that cooking in the woods would expose their target, they set up stoves in the sheltered mountain gullies. In short, they were not afraid of any fatigue for the sake of the wounded. Some doctors and nurses also prepared several days' worth of dry food, boiled water, and medicine in advance for the convenience of nursing, and sheltered in a cave with the wounded. When the enemy "encircled and suppressed", some mountain caves were discovered by the enemy, and the medical staff and the wounded guarded the cave entrance together, skillfully resisting the enemy. When the devils fired guns, they hid; if they climbed up, they threw stones at them. In this way, they often persisted for a whole day. At night, everyone carried the wounded carefully around the cordon and broke through the enemy's encirclement.

　　Due to the war environment, medical personnel and medicines were very scarce, so they extensively united and organized local Chinese medicine practitioners, absorbed and studied their experience, and introduced these experiences to the troops. At the same time, they also planted and purchased mountain herbs, and after testing and refining, manufactured various special medicines—malaria tablets, dysentery pills, etc.

　　International friend Dr. Norman Bethune gave great help in training cadres and improving skills.

　　In these years of arduous struggle, the people of the border region were united with the soldiers like a family. Although there were years of famine at that time, and most of the people ate bran and tree leaves, as soon as they encountered wounded soldiers of their own, they quickly took out the white flour that they had saved for the New Year to feed them. The masses carried stools, urine, water, and food to the wounded, taking care of them more thoughtfully than their own sons. Cui Luotang, a poor farmer from XingShuTai Village in Yi County, in addition to taking care of his family of six, also took care of two wounded during a "mopping-up" operation, carrying them from one mountain to another, carrying one and then the other, traversing more than a hundred miles.

　　One morning in the spring of 1943, before dawn, the enemy surrounded Yechangshigou Village in Wan County, captured more than one hundred and fifty villagers, threatened them with bayonets and machine guns, and beat them with leather whips and wooden sticks, forcing them to ask about the location of our rear warehouses, hospitals, and wounded shelters. But the people of the border region, with a high degree of consciousness, refused to tell a single truth even to death. A children's captain shouted, "Don't reveal military secrets!" and finally died under the enemy's bayonet; the director of the women's association also gloriously sacrificed herself in the same way. When the brutal enemy set up machine guns to strafe, the villagers still refused to reveal the truth.

　　The enemy retreated, and our hospitals were rebuilt. In this way, year after year passed, our hospitals were not destroyed by the enemy, on the contrary, they developed day by day, successfully completing the medical tasks entrusted by the revolutionary war.

　　记山地医院的成长
    ——抗日时期晋察冀边区医务工作者的伟绩
    一九三七年秋平型关战斗后，解放军一部在聂荣臻将军率领下挺进敌后，以北岳地区为基础，创立了晋察冀抗日根据地；也建立了人民自己的医院。一九四○年的百团大战，使敌人遭受了严重的损失。于是，日寇便不惜抽调大量兵力来对付我们，一面实行封锁；一面残酷地进行“扫荡”，到处实行其残暴的“三光”政策。这时，我们的医院为了保证伤病员的安全治疗，争取反“扫荡”的胜利，就向深山里分散转移。
    在崎岖的山路上，医生、护士们除了背着自己的东西和医药器材外，还参加抬担架、背伤员。这种情形，使轻伤病员很受感动，就都爬下担架自己行走。有时，在转移中遭到敌人袭击，医务人员和部分轻伤员，就拿起武器狙击敌人，掩护伤员安全转移。医务人员们往往为了掩护伤员而自己被围殉难。王蕴华同志是一个优秀的共产党员。有一次，她带着二十多个伤员转移，中途碰上了敌人。她为了掩护伤员撤退而被敌人包围，便奋不顾身地与敌人顽抗。子弹打光了，她就用石头做武器。终于，敌人冲上来了。但是她没有屈服，高呼着“共产党万岁”而光荣就义。
    敌人“扫荡”是长期的，但伤病员一天也不能离开治疗。于是医务人员一面广泛与各地方政府联系，与群众、游击组密切配合，轮流站岗放哨，侦察敌情，在山顶上竖立起情报杆，在敌人可能经过的道路上埋设地雷、石雷。他们在山庄上建立起病室，把伤员们安置得舒舒服服，并且一有时间便到山上去打柴和碾面，给伤员们改善伙食。他们为了对付敌人疯狂的搜索，还在高高的山腰上挖设了“梯田病室”，并爬遍悬崖陡壁觅寻岩洞，加以布置，使这些从来没有人到过的山洞，变成安全的治疗所。医务人员们每天提着药包到各个山洞和“梯田病室”里去巡回治疗，送水和送饭，同时给伤病员们讲解胜利消息和国内外新闻。
    敌人搜山了。医务人员们白天和敌人转圈子，黑夜还得偷偷地往返爬越山岭，给伤员们换药和送水、送饭。他们不顾一切困难，心里只有一个信念：“自己辛苦点没什么，可不能叫伤员们受罪。”有时粮食用完了，他们就冒险到敌人据点附近去背。有时他们怕在树林里做饭暴露目标，就在荫蔽的山沟里打起锅灶。总之，他们为了伤员不怕一切劳累。也有的医生护士为了护理方便，事先准备下几天的干粮、开水和医药，和伤员在一个洞里荫蔽着。敌人“围剿”时，有的山洞被敌人发觉了，医务人员和伤员们便在一起严守着洞口，巧妙地抗击着敌人。鬼子用枪打，他们就掩蔽起来；若往上爬，他们就用石头掷去。就这样，他们常常坚持了一整天。夜里，大家背着伤员小心翼翼地绕过警戒线，冲出敌人的包围圈。
    由于战争环境，医务人员和药品都很缺乏，他们便广泛地团结和组织当地的中医，吸取和研究中医经验，并把这些经验介绍到部队中。同时，他们更种植和采购山地草药，经过化验提炼，制造了各种特效药品——疟疾片、止痢丸等。
    在训练干部和提高技术方面，国际友人诺尔曼·白求恩大夫给了很大的帮助。
    在这艰苦斗争的岁月里，边区人民像一家人一样和战士们结合在一起。虽说当时连年灾荒，人民大部吃糠皮、树叶，但一遇着子弟兵的伤员，就赶紧拿出自己省着过年过节用的白面来给他们吃。群众给伤员们端屎、端尿、喂水、喂饭，照护得比自己的儿子还周到。易县杏树台村贫农崔洛唐，在一次反“扫荡”期间，除照顾一家老少六口人外，还照顾着两个伤员，从这个山头背到那个山头，背了一个再背一个，辗转百余里。
    一九四三年春天的一个早晨，天还未明，敌人就包围了完县野场石沟村，抓了一百五十多个老乡，用刺刀、机枪威胁，用皮鞭、木棍毒打，逼问我后方仓库、医院、伤员掩蔽的地方。但有高度觉悟的边区人民，宁死不说一句实话。有一个儿童队长高喊：“不暴露军事资财秘密！”终于死在敌人的刺刀下了；妇女会主任也同样光荣就义。当残暴的敌人支起机枪扫射的时候，老乡们仍然不肯吐露真实的情况。
    敌人退去了，我们的医院重新建设起来。这样，一年一年的过去了，我们的医院并没有被敌人摧毁，相反地却一天天得到发展，胜利完成了革命战争所赋予的医疗任务。
