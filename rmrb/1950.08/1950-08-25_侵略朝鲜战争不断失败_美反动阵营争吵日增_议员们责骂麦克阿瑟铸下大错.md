　　Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: As the war of aggression against Korea suffers repeated failures, certain elements within the American reactionary bloc have launched attacks on MacArthur and Johnson, who directly command the war of aggression against Korea. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington, Democratic Congressman Sikes demanded on the 17th that the highest-ranking American military leader in Korea be replaced. Sikes said: "We should no longer blindly worship high-ranking generals, and should admit that mistakes have been made there—costly mistakes." A reporter asked Sikes: "Are you referring to MacArthur?" Sikes replied: "He is responsible." Sikes continued: "We had better face the facts. We have been taking terrible blows... The heights of Chinju are covered with the blood of American soldiers. We shouldn't think that as long as more appropriations are passed, all problems can be solved and all wars can be won. This is simply deceiving ourselves." On the same day, Lewis, president of the American Veterans of Foreign Wars, stated in Detroit that Secretary of Defense Johnson should be replaced because he is "completely incompetent." Lewis said: "I condemn Johnson because he is utterly ignorant." Democratic Senator Byrd of Virginia delivered a speech in Alexandria on the 18th, complaining that the American authorities should not spend large amounts of materials in the "small war" of aggression against Korea, and make the United States face the serious threat of inflation.

    美反动阵营争吵日增
    议员们责骂麦克阿瑟铸下大错
    【新华社二十四日讯】由于侵略朝鲜的战争遭到不断的失败，美国反动集团内部的若干分子，已对直接指挥侵略朝鲜战争的麦克阿瑟与詹逊，发动攻击。据合众社华盛顿讯，美民主党众议员辛斯十七日要求撤换美国在朝鲜的最高军事领袖。辛斯说：“我们不要再盲目崇拜高级将领了，应当承认那里已铸下了错误——代价昂贵的错误。”记者问辛斯：“你是指麦克阿瑟吗？”辛斯答道：“他是有责任的。”辛斯继称：“我们最好面对事实。我们一直受到可怕的打击……晋州高地上染遍了美军的鲜血，我们不要以为只要通过了更多的拨款，所有的问题便都能解决，所有的战争都能获胜，这简直是自己骗自己。”同日，美国国外战争退伍军人协会会长鲁易斯在底特律发表谈话，要求撤换美国防部长詹逊，因为他“完全不能称职”。鲁易斯称：“我谴责詹逊，因为他全然无知。”美国佛吉尼亚州民主党参议员比尔德十八日在亚历山大里亚发表演说，埋怨美国当局不应在侵略朝鲜的“小战”中，耗费大量物资，并使美国面临通货膨胀的严重威胁。
