　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: About 100,000 surplus laborers in the rural areas of Northeast China have been transferred to industrial and mining production departments in the past six months. This is a result of strengthening labor mutual aid organizations and improving agricultural technology after the land reform. In Zhuanghe, Xinjin, and Fu counties of Liaodong Province, more than 50,000 farmers have participated in the work of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Benxi Coal and Iron Company, and nearby factories and mines. In some areas of Liaoxi Province, in addition to participating in the production of private enterprises, over 10,000 surplus rural laborers were introduced by the Provincial Labor Bureau to work in the Fuxin Coal Mine. A considerable number of farmers in Songjiang and Jilin provinces have also been transferred to local industries and state-owned mines and forestry centers.

　　In Zhuanghe County, which has more than 2,000 mutual aid teams and more than 20,000 plow-sharing groups, nearly 20,000 surplus rural laborers have switched to other professions. The land they were allocated has been handed over to mutual aid teams or plow-sharing groups for cultivation. They remit a portion of their wages earned in industrial and mining production as remuneration for those who cultivate the land on their behalf. This prevents land from being deserted and improves their living conditions. Most of these farmers who have already been transferred to industrial and mining production are enthusiastic about learning and have initially mastered industrial and mining production techniques.

　　The transfer of surplus rural labor is carried out under the overall planning of the Northeast People's Government. The labor departments and trade unions of governments at all levels are mainly responsible for recruiting workers in a planned manner based on the number of workers needed by local industrial and mining enterprises and the local labor surplus, thereby avoiding the blindness of factories and mines recruiting workers on their own and rural areas organizing surplus labor on their own. The People's Governments of Fuxin and Xingcheng counties in Liaoxi Province have adopted the method of signing contracts with factories and mines that need workers, which has achieved even better results. As the number of workers needed by industries and mines in Northeast China during the recovery and development is quite large, more than 200,000 scattered workers in Northeast China participated in industrial, mining, and forestry production and construction work in the first quarter of this year. Subsequently, in addition to striving to complete the plan of recruiting skilled workers within the customs, the Northeast People's Government also mobilized a large number of surplus laborers in rural areas to participate in industrial and mining production.

### 土改后加强劳动互助改进农业技术  东北农村十万剩余劳力  转入工厂矿山生产部门

　　土改后加强劳动互助改进农业技术
    东北农村十万剩余劳力  转入工厂矿山生产部门
    【本报讯】据新华社沈阳讯：东北农村半年来约有十万剩余劳动力转入工矿生产部门，这是由于土地改革后加强了劳动互助组织，改进了农业技术的结果。辽东省庄河、新金、复县三县，有五万余农民参加了鞍山钢铁公司、本溪煤铁公司和附近各工厂与矿山的工作。辽西省若干地区的农村剩余劳动力，除参加私营企业生产外，由该省劳动局介绍至阜新煤矿生产者约万余人。松江、吉林等省转入地方工业及国营矿山、林场生产的农民也为数不少。
    有两千余个互助组和两万余个插犋组的庄河县，近两万个农村剩余劳动力转业后，他们分得的土地都交给互助组或插犋组代耕，把自己在工矿生产中所收入的一部分工资寄回，作为代耕者的酬金。这样既不荒芜土地，又改善了自己的生活。这些已转入工矿业生产的农民，大都热心学习并初步掌握了工矿生产技术。
    农村剩余劳动力的转业，是在东北人民政府统筹之下进行的。主要是由各级人民政府的劳动部门和工会，根据各地工矿企业所需要工人数量和当地劳动力的剩余情况，有计划地进行招聘，从而避免了各工厂矿山自行招工和各地农村自行组织剩余劳动力的盲目性。辽西省阜新、兴城等县人民政府，并采取了与需要工人的厂矿订立合同的方式，效果更好。按东北工矿业在恢复和发展中，需要增添工人的数量颇大。在今年第一季中，东北各地流散工人参加东北工、矿、林等业生产和修建工作的即有二十多万人。随后，东北人民政府除努力在关内完成招聘技术工人的计划外，并在农村中动员大批剩余劳动力，参加工矿生产事业。
