Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government issued "Instructions on Collecting Tree Seeds for 1950" on the 3rd of this month. The instructions first pointed out that collecting forest tree seeds is the most basic matter in forestry work and should be planned and prepared early so as to victoriously complete this year's seed collection work and prepare sufficient conditions for afforestation and seedling cultivation in 1951.

The instructions pointed out that the collection of forest tree seeds should first conduct investigations into important seed-producing areas, taking into account the long-term interests of the country and the current interests of the masses, and carry out planned and focused collection. When selecting tree species, emphasis should be placed on tree species with afforestation value, few diseases and insect pests, strong germination ability, and sustainability. In North China, Northwest China, and the western parts of Liaoning, Rehe, and Heilongjiang in Northeast China, as well as the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui, Shandong, and the eastern part of Henan in East China and Central South China, large quantities of afforestation tree species should be collected to prevent wind and sand, conserve water and soil, and eliminate barren mountains and sandy wastes, as well as tree species that are sufficiently reliable for sowing and afforestation on barren mountains; shrub and grass seeds can also be collected when necessary. Oak and walnut seeds grow well in the vast areas of North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China, and should be fully collected according to the actual situation, paying attention to collecting as much as possible locally, that is, sowing locally. Other tree species such as purple acacia, lespedeza, and white ash are generally suitable for most areas of North China and should be collected as much as possible for distribution. As for the northeastern part of Northeast China, the collection should focus on timber tree species; East China, Central South China, and Southwest China should focus on the collection of timber and special-purpose tree species. On Hainan Island, large quantities of rubber tree seeds should be collected. Each region should determine the amount of seed collection based on the needs of afforestation and seedling cultivation in the autumn of 1950 and throughout 1951. In terms of seed collection techniques, it is necessary to grasp the maturity period of the seeds, not too early or too late, and attention should be paid to the storage and management methods of the seeds.

After the seed collection plan is determined, the leadership organs at all levels should immediately make specific arrangements for the collection work. The masses should be encouraged to collect seeds on their own for sporadic planting, seedling cultivation, and sowing afforestation on barren mountains in areas with conditions. All regions should pay attention to carefully selecting and specially protecting the existing mother tree forests to overcome the current difficulties in the lack of seedlings.

　　中央林垦部发布
    采集树木种子指示
    号召各地及早计划准备
    【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府林垦部本月三日发布“关于一九五○年采集树木种子的指示”。该指示首先指出，采集林木种子是林业工作的最基本事项，应及早计划和准备，以便使今年的采种工作胜利完成，给一九五一年造林育苗业务准备充分条件。
    指示指出，采集林木种子应先对重要产种地区进行调查，照顾到国家长远利益和群众当前利益，作有计划有重点的采集。在选择树种时，应着重于有造林价值，病虫害少，发芽力强，并能持久的树种。华北、西北及东北区的辽西、热河、黑龙江的西部以及华东、中南区的苏北、皖北、山东、豫东等地区，应大量采集防止风沙、保持水土、消灭山荒和沙荒的造林树种，和有充分把握可供荒山播种造林的树种；灌木类及草类种子必要时亦可采集。橡、栎、胡桃种子在华北、西北、东北广大地区生长良好，应根据实际情况充分采集，注意尽可能在当地采，即在当地播。其他如紫穗槐、胡枝子、白腊树等普遍适合于华北大多数地区的树种，应尽量采集，以便调剂。至于东北区的东北部应以采集用材树种为主；华东、中南、西南等地应以采集用材及特用树种为主。在海南岛应大量采集橡胶树种子。各地区应根据一九五○年秋及一九五一年全年造林育苗的需要，决定采种数量。在采种技术方面，要把握种子的成熟期，不要过早或过迟，并应注意种子的贮藏和管理方法。
    采种计划经确定以后，各级领导机关应即具体布置采集工作。应鼓励群众自行采集零星植树、育苗和有条件地区的荒山播种造林所需的种子。各地区应注意将原有的母树林经过慎重选定后，特别加以保护，以克服目前种苗缺乏的困难。
