[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipality's sewer excavation and repair project for this year is now basically complete, thanks to the timely construction by the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau and the efforts of the broad masses of workers and engineers over the past four months. A total of one-third of the city's sewer system has been excavated and repaired. In Longxugou, a residential area for laboring people with poor environmental sanitation, over eight thousand and forty meters of new sewers have been built. During the project, a large number of peasants and unemployed city residents were organized to participate in the work through the "work-for-relief" method, ensuring the use of a large amount of labor. The excavated ditch mud was also transported out of the city by suburban farmers before and after the spring plowing season to be used as fertilizer.

The total length of streets in the city is 755 kilometers, of which 246 kilometers have sewers, accounting for only one-third of the total street length. Because some streets have double or triple ditches, the total length of the sewer ditches is 314 kilometers. A large portion of the sewers were built during the Ming Dynasty, more than 500 years ago. The materials used were fine clay bricks weighing 48 catties each, covered with bluestone. Although clumsy, they are very sturdy and can generally last for several decades. However, a portion of the sewers (approximately 54 kilometers) has been severely damaged due to years of disrepair, with an estimated total silt accumulation of 160,000 cubic meters, requiring excavation and repair. Since February of this year, the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau, with the engineering corps as the backbone, has organized a large number of peasants and unemployed city residents to begin the mud excavation work. During the project, workers and engineers demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm. For example, worker Miao Shunxing insisted on working for two days and nights without rest to rush repair the Peace Gate outlet. Worker Zhang Yuhua took the lead in carrying 90 bricks at a time (each brick weighing five catties). To understand the sewer situation in the western section of West Chang'an Street, engineer Wang Fuzhong crawled back and forth for 100 meters in a suffocating, stinking ditch. Thanks to the close combination and efforts of workers and engineers, by the end of April, the excavation work of the North-South Ditch Edge, North Xinhua Street, Qipan Street, Chongwenmen, Chaoyangmen, Andingmen Inner, and Dashiqiao six systems, with a total length of 81,549 meters (accounting for one-third of the city's total sewer length), and 39,820 cubic meters of mud removal was completed. Immediately afterwards, the repair project began. By the end of last month, a total of 7,323 meters of ditch body had been renovated and repaired, 7,406 meters of ditch body slope had been improved, 1,226 inspection wells and 624 rainwater outlets had been added, and 1,883 meters of ditch covers had been replaced. The entire excavation and repair project used a total of 150,294 man-days of labor, including 116,645 man-days of work-for-relief. The repair project is basically complete. Due to the rule of the reactionary government, Beijing's sewers were mostly concentrated in the residential areas of "wealthy families" in the east and west cities. As for the places where the laboring people lived, there were very few sewers. Not only was sewage unable to be discharged, but also serious water accumulation occurred every rainy season, making some structurally unsound houses prone to collapse. In order to gradually solve this problem, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in addition to building new sewers in Longxugou, where the laboring people live, also used new sewers and road drainage methods in the East, West, and North City Roots, Paozi River, Elephant Trunk Pit, Taipingcang, Xinpiku Hutong, and in front of Xinhua Gate to solve the serious water accumulation problems that have occurred over the years. The Sanitation Engineering Bureau also announced the method of connecting sewer branch ditches in mid-June, encouraging citizens to connect branch ditches. As of now, 667 households have applied.

### 京市掏挖下水道工程基本完成  劳动人民聚居地区新建下水道八千余公尺

　　京市掏挖下水道工程基本完成
    劳动人民聚居地区新建下水道八千余公尺
    【京市新闻处讯】京市本年度下水道掏挖及整修工程，由于卫生工程局施工得时与广大工人、工程师四个月来的努力，现已基本完成，计掏挖与整修了全市下水道总长的三分之一；并于劳动人民聚居、环境卫生恶劣的龙须沟新建下水道八千零四十公尺。在工程进行当中，用以工代赈方式组织了大批农民及失业市民参加工作，保证了大量工力的使用。掏出的沟泥亦均于春耕前后由郊区农民运出城外充作肥料。
    全市街道总长七五五公里，有下水道者二四六公里，仅占街道总长的三分之一。因为有些街道是双沟或三条沟，所以沟道总长为三一四公里。有很大的一部分下水道还是明朝修建的，距今已五百多年，使用的材料是重四十八斤一块的细泥城砖，上盖青石，虽然笨拙，却很坚固，一般地还可以支持几十年。但有一部下水道（约有五十四公里）由于年久失修已严重损坏，估计总淤泥量十六万公方，须要掏挖与整修。自今年二月起，市卫生工程局以工程总队为骨干，组织了大批农民及失业市民开始掏泥工作。工程进行当中，工人与工程师都发挥了高度的劳动热忱，如工人苗顺兴为抢修和平门外出水口，坚持二昼夜不休息；工人张玉华带头一次抬砖九十块（每块五市斤）；为了解西长安街西段下水道情况，工程师王福忠在空气窒息的臭沟里来回爬行一百公尺。由于工人与工程师紧密的结合及努力，至四月底就完成了南北沟沿、北新华街、棋盘街、崇文门、朝阳门、安定门内、大石桥六系统长八万一千五百四十九公尺的掏挖工作（合全市下水道总长的三分之一），出泥三万九千八百二十公方。随即开始整修工程，至上月下旬止，计完成翻修与补修沟身长七千三百二十三公尺，改善沟身坡度七千四百零六公尺，添修探井一千二百二十六座、雨水口六百二十四座，换沟盖一千八百八十三公尺。全部掏挖与整修工程共计使用人力十五万零二百九十四工，内工赈十一万六千六百四十五个工。整修工程基本完成。由于反动政府的统治，北京的下水道大多集中在东西城“富贵人家”的住宅区，至于劳动人民居住的地方，就很少有下水道。不但污水无法宣泄，每至雨季更造成严重的积水，使一些建筑不固的房屋易于倒塌。京市人民政府为逐步解决这一问题，除已在劳动人民聚居的龙须沟新建下水道以外，并在东、西、北城根，泡子河、象鼻子坑、太平仓、新皮库胡同、新华门前等地区，用新建下水道及路面排水等办法解决了历年来严重的积水问题。卫生工程局并于六月中旬公布了接修下水道支沟办法，鼓励市民接修支沟，截至目前止已有六百六十七户提出申请。
