　　Korean Battle Heroes

　　In the battles of the Korean People's Army against the American aggressors, countless outstanding battle heroes emerged. Witnessing the barbaric atrocities of the American army, they were filled with fervor and brought into play their high degree of resourcefulness and bravery in battle, rendering great service to the motherland and the people. The following three reports about the battle heroes of the infantry and air force are excerpted from the "Rodong Sinmun" and "Democratic Overseas Chinese" in Pyongyang.

　　Crossing-the-River Hero Kim Si-jeong

　　Sergeant Kim Si-jeong (transliteration), braving the rain of bullets, victoriously completed the combat mission of his company crossing the Han River.

　　Sergeant Kim Si-jeong, who was awarded the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has demonstrated his heroism in several fierce battles since the first day of the war.

　　He knows no terror in the war against the enemy.

　　After breaking through the 38th parallel, through the battle of Uijeongbu, until the battle of liberating Seoul, he fulfilled his combat tasks in an exemplary manner.

　　The day after the liberation of Seoul, June 29th, his detachment had to cross the Han River in order to pursue the retreating enemy. At this time, the company commander ordered Sergeant Kim Si-jeong and Sergeant Kim Il-byeon (transliteration) to find wooden boats for the troops to cross the river.

　　He recognized the importance of this task and was determined to complete the combat mission entrusted to him by the motherland and the people. He immediately went to the riverbank to inspect and only saw the corpses of women who had been brutally murdered by the puppet "National Defense Army" and some pieces of damaged wooden boats lying everywhere. Because the "National Defense Army" destroyed all the boats when they fled, no wooden boats could be found.

　　The enemy on the opposite high ground was frantically firing 105mm cannons and heavy machine guns incessantly. He was faced with extremely difficult circumstances, but in his determination to sacrifice himself for the people, the enemy's bullets were not a problem. He was only worried that he would not be able to find a boat and complete the company's river-crossing combat mission, so he felt the importance of the task more and more.

　　Standing on the riverbank, he saw a small wooden boat on the opposite bank. This wooden boat was a lifeline for the company's river-crossing operation. He immediately disregarded everything and went into the river water, which was boiling due to the enemy's bullets, and floated towards the wooden boat.

　　The enemy's bullets were falling everywhere, left, right, front, and back, but for the sake of victory, he finally braved the bullets and rowed the wooden boat over. This wooden boat could only hold ten people, so they had to cross the river several times.

　　On this day, he transported the entire company after several trips back and forth. Thanks to Sergeant Kim Si-jeong's resolute struggle, the river-crossing combat mission of the ×× detachment was guaranteed.

　　After crossing the Han River, the detachment crushed and wiped out the struggling and fleeing enemy, and continued to advance southward.

　　Afterwards, Sergeant Kim Si-jeong continued to sweep away the enemy at the forefront of the troops and advance heroically.
　　(Translated from the "Rodong Sinmun" on July 28)

　　The Kang Tae-woon Company that Liberated Gongju

　　In the battle to liberate Gongju, the combat unit commanded by Acting Company Commander Kang Tae-woon was tasked with attacking the American artillery positions that attempted to hinder our army's river crossing, blocking the enemy's retreat, and encircling and annihilating the enemy. Kang Tae-woon's company braved the enemy's fierce artillery fire and relentless shooting, overcoming all difficulties with a lack of various equipment, and forcibly crossed the Geum River at 8:00 AM on July 14th. Then, they bravely climbed a steep mountain range of more than four kilometers, covertly approached the left flank of the American artillery position, and after knocking out the American surveillance soldiers and infantry sentries watching our army on the right side of the high ground, they suddenly launched a surprise attack and captured the assault line in one fell swoop. On both sides of the road in front of the high ground were the hateful American 105mm artillery positions, which were about one kilometer long, with a queue of more than one hundred vehicles consisting of ammunition trucks, ambulances, and catering trucks. The American 105mm artillery positions continued to fire fiercely at our army crossing the Geum River. The combatants of the company, upon discovering the enemy positions, had eyes burning with hatred for the enemy.

　　The enemy guns were constantly firing, and at the same time, lewd and extravagant music was coming from the enemy positions. They heard the sound of the radio and saw some American lackeys holding rice bowls, and some were doing laundry.

　　After waiting for mortars and other weapons to be transported, Kang Tae-woon's company formed an assault team led by Company Commander Choi Sang-jung, with the assault team attacking the front of the enemy, and the remaining squads led by Acting Company Commander Kang Tae-woon, maneuvering to the left to block the enemy's retreat, researching and deciding on a plan to encircle and annihilate the enemy.

　　At about 12:00 noon, the company commander gave the signal to start the attack. Squad Leader Lee Chang-ryong aimed a mortar at the enemy's car speeding with ammunition, and the first shot hit it happily, and the ammunition in the car exploded and shook the surroundings.

　　The American lackeys, who were more timid than anyone else, suddenly heard the sound of mortar fire and the explosion of the ammunition truck, and they all panicked and started to flee one after another. Our heavy machine guns, tank guns, light machine guns, and rifles all started firing at the same time. The ammunition trucks exploded one after another, and most of the American officers fleeing in the vehicles were killed. However, the retreat route had been blocked, and the encircled enemy was still making a last-ditch effort, firing violently with 60mm mortars and heavy weapons, but our brave combatants were in high spirits and further compressed the encirclement.

　　Our tank shells continued to hit the fleeing enemy vehicles. The powerful heavy machine gun and mortar firepower continued to inflict heavy blows on the enemy. The enemy, who attempted to hinder our army's advance and resist, was finally beaten by the brave combatants so that not a single car could escape. Most of the enemies who fled in embarrassment were either killed or captured.

　　Thanks to the daring and brave lightning raid by Acting Company Commander Kang Tae-woon, our army won a brilliant victory, annihilated the enemy, and liberated Gongju. (Reprinted from Pyongyang's "Democratic Overseas Chinese")

　　Air Force Hero Kim Ki-ok

　　On the first day of the liberation of Daejeon, July 19th, at 5:45 AM, the praiseworthy and brave Korean eagles—pilots Jang Young-tae, Yang Tae-hyun, Lee Kyung-ryul, and Kim Cha-seok—flying attack aircraft, and pilots Kim Byung-yeop, Lee Myung-soon, and Tae Keuk-sung flying fighter aircraft, were ordered to attack the rear of the American ground forces fleeing from Daejeon. The rumbling explosions broke through the quiet morning air as they eagerly departed from a certain base.

　　They were determined to leave no one unpunished and thoroughly annihilate the murderous American imperialists who were carrying out beastly armed aggression in our motherland, attempting to block the advance of our incomparably brave army, and carrying out beastly blind bombing of peaceful cities and villages, and massacring innocent people in large numbers. These warriors of the blue sky, who had repeatedly achieved brilliant results in dozens of battles, had made their names known to the enemy. On that day, when they discovered the American ground forces fleeing in panic over the southern sky of Daejeon, the blood of our blue sky warriors immediately boiled.

　　The brave Korean eagles turned their heads to the enemy and boldly began to attack.

　　The attack aircraft and fighter aircraft in neat formations, while threatening the enemy troops, began to bomb the enemy warehouses in an instant, and then searched for the fleeing American ground forces and blew up the northern iron bridge. Another formation discovering enemy military trains approached the target like lightning and dropped bombs, burning five enemy locomotives.

　　Thus blocking the enemy's retreat, in order to easily enable the People's Army ground forces to encircle and annihilate them.

　　At this moment, dozens of enemy aircraft suddenly came to challenge. The valiant warriors of our air force immediately engaged them, and a fierce aerial battle unfolded.

　　Our aircraft, which started fighting with dozens of enemy aircraft, found the battle very difficult.

　　The bullets poured down like rain, making it difficult for our air force to approach. The bullets from the enemy's machine guns and rocket launchers were constantly falling in front of, behind, and on the left and right sides of our aircraft. The intense aerial fire continuously shook the morning air.

　　But our invincible air warriors skillfully dodged the enemy's fire, attacked the enemy aircraft vertically and horizontally, and in a short time shot down four enemy aircraft, and the rest fled in panic, gaining brilliant results.

　　At 9:55 AM on that day, a certain base received intelligence that six "B-29" aircraft, which called themselves "aerial fortresses," and six fighter aircraft from the American Air Force were coming to bomb the peaceful cities and villages of Kimpo Airport and the Kyongsong area. They immediately ordered Korean heroes Kim Ki-ok and Hwang Se-chang to repel them. Upon receiving the order, they skillfully took off in their beloved aircraft and headed straight for the enemy aircraft.

　　At this time, the enemy aircraft were immediately discovered. The brave Korean eagles rushed into the enemy formation without hesitation and began to attack. Twelve enemy aircraft and two of our aircraft began a fierce aerial battle. But in the face of their mastery of skilled techniques and the burning love for the motherland, no enemy aircraft could resist.

　　Before long, due to the bold attacks of the two warriors, the enemy formation fell into chaos. One B-29 enemy aircraft, hit by Kim Ki-ok, spewed black smoke, swayed its ugly body, and crashed. The remaining aircraft fled in panic. Our aircraft pursued them far away and completely repelled them.

　　Korean hero Kim Ki-ok, an air force warrior, had shot down a total of nine enemy aircraft, including B-29s, and had successively established brilliant battle achievements.

　　Our incomparably brave air force warriors are still covering the People's Army ground forces advancing southward, constantly searching for enemy aircraft, and continuing the fierce aerial battle. (Reprinted from Pyongyang's "Democratic Overseas Chinese")

　　朝鲜的战斗英雄
    在朝鲜人民军对美国侵略者的战斗中间，涌现了无数优秀的战斗英雄。他们目睹美军野蛮的兽行，一个个热血沸腾，在战斗中发挥其高度的机智与勇敢，为祖国、为人民立下大功。下面所辑的关于步兵和空军的战斗英雄的三篇报道，摘自平壤“劳动新闻”及“民主华侨”。
     ——编者
    渡江英雄金时正
    金时正（译音）下士官冒着弹雨，胜利完成了连队横渡汉江的作战任务。
    被授予朝鲜人民共和国英雄称号的金时正下士官，从战争开始第一天起，在数次猛烈的战斗中，发挥了英勇性。
    对敌战争中，他是不知道恐怖的。
    突破三八线以后，经过议政府战斗，直到解放汉城的战斗，他都模范的完成了自己所负的战斗任务。
    解放汉城的次日，即六月二十九日，他所属的这分队，为追击溃退之敌人，必须渡过汉江。在这时候，连长命令金时正下士官和金日变（译音）下士官，找木船使部队渡江。
    他认识到这个任务的重大，并决心要完成为祖国和人民自己所负的战斗任务。他马上到江边去巡视，只见到处躺着被伪“国防军”虐杀的妇女们的尸首和一些被破坏的木船片。因为“国防军”逃亡时，把所有的船都破坏了，所以找不到一只木船。
    对岸高地上的敌人不间断的发疯似的射击着一○五糎炮和重机枪。他面临极其困难的环境，但在决心为人民准备牺牲的他看来，敌人的枪弹是不成问题的。他只忧虑自己找不到船而完不成连队渡江作战任务，所以他愈想愈感到任务的重大。
    他站在江边了望，发现对岸有一条小木船，这条木船就是连队过江作战上的一条生命船。他立刻不顾一切，下到因敌人的枪弹而像开了锅似的江水里，向木船浮过去。
    敌人的枪弹左右前后到处都落，但他为着胜利，终于冒着枪弹把木船划过来。这个木船只能坐十人，因此不得不分乘数次渡江。
    这一天，他以数次来回把全连队都运完。由于金时正下士官的决心的斗争，保障了××区分队的渡江作战任务。
    过了汉江的区分队，粉碎和扫荡着挣扎和溃走的敌人，继续向南挺进着。
    以后金时正下士官，继续在部队的最前列，扫荡敌人，英勇的前进着。
    （译自七月二十八日“劳动新闻”）
    解放公州的姜泰云中队
    在解放公州战役中间，代理中队长姜泰云所指挥的战斗部队担负了向企图阻碍我军渡江的美军炮兵阵地进攻，并遮断敌人退路，包围和歼灭敌人的任务。姜泰云中队冒着敌人的猛烈炮火和不容喘息的射击，在缺乏各种器材条件下克服了一切困难，于七月十四日午前八时强渡锦江。于是勇敢的攀登长达四公里以上的峻岭，隐避接近美军炮兵阵地左翼，距离约三百米的高地，击毙在右侧高地了望我军的美军监视兵和步兵哨兵后，突然进行奇袭，一举占领了突击线。在高地前方的道路两侧有可憎的美军一○五粍炮兵阵地，是约一公里纵面筑成的，有弹药车、卫生车、炊事车等百余辆汽车编成的队列。美军一○五粍炮的阵地，对渡过锦江的我军继续猛烈的射击。发现敌阵的中队战斗员们，两眼便像冒火似的燃烧着敌忾心了。
    敌炮不断的射击，同时由敌人阵地透出淫靡娇奢的音乐。听见收音机的声音，又看见有些美国奴才拿着饭碗围绕着，并有些人正在洗濯的形态。
    姜泰云中队等待迫击炮等各种武器运到后，组成了以中队长崔尚重为指挥官的突击组，由突击组进攻敌人正面，其余小队由姜泰云代理中队长指挥，向左侧迂回遮断敌后方的退路，研究决定包围歼灭敌人的计划。
    到十二时许，中队长传达信号开始攻击，李昌龙小队长以迫击炮瞄准满载炮弹而疾驰的敌人汽车，头一炮就很痛快的予以命中，汽车上满载的炮弹登时爆炸震动周围。
    比谁都胆怯的美国奴才们，突然听到迫击炮射击和炮弹车的爆炸声，都唐慌失措争先恐后的开始逃窜。我方重机及坦克炮、轻机、步枪一齐开始射击，炮弹车接连不断爆炸，乘车逃窜的美军的军官多数均被击毙。可是退却路已被遮断，被包围的敌人，犹作最后挣扎，横暴地以六十粍迫击炮及重火器等猛烈射击，然而我勇敢的战斗员气势高昂，更加压缩包围网。
    我军坦克炮弹继续命中逃窜的敌人汽车。有威力的重机、迫击炮火力不断的给予敌人重大打击。企图阻挠我军进击而行抵抗的敌军，终被勇敢的战斗员打得一辆汽车也未能幸免。狼狈逃窜的敌人，大多数是被击毙或被俘虏。
    由于姜泰云代理中队长大胆而勇敢的进行闪电奇袭，我军获得了灿烂的胜利，将敌人歼灭殆尽，解放了公州。（转载平壤“民主华侨”）
   空军英雄金基玉
    解放大田的头一日，即七月十九日五时四十五分，堪以夸耀的勇敢的朝鲜雄鹰——张英泰、杨泰铉、李京律、金车石驾驶员所驾驶的袭击机与金炳烨、李明淳、太克成驾驶员的驱逐机，奉命袭击从大田逃窜的美军地上部队后方，隆隆的爆音，突破了静晨的空气，他们踊跃的由某基地出发了。
    他们对于在我祖国进行野兽性的武装进攻，企图阻挡英勇无比的我军挺进，并且对于和平的城市与农村，实行兽行的盲炸，大量屠杀无辜人民的杀人恶魔美帝国主义者，务使一名也不漏网，彻底予以消灭。他们曾经在十数次的战斗中屡次取得了辉煌战果，这些青空的勇士，威名已寒敌胆。该日在大田南方上空，当着发现慌忙逃窜的美军地上部队之际，我们青空勇士的热血立即沸腾起来。
    英勇的朝鲜雄鹰对敌人转移机首，便大胆地开始进行攻击。
    队列整齐的袭击机和驱逐机，一面威胁着敌军部队，一面瞬息间开始轰炸敌军用仓库，接着寻觅逃窜的美军地上部队，炸毁北方的铁桥。发现敌军用列车的另一编队，如闪电般的接近目标施以投弹，烧毁敌军用机关车五辆。
    于是遮断敌人的退路，以便易使人民军地上部队予以包围歼灭。
    正在这时候，突然有数十架敌机前来挑战。英勇的我航空队勇士，即时迎战，于是展开了壮烈的空中战。
    与数十架敌机开始作战的我航空机，战斗甚感困难。
    敌人倾射的子弹如雨，使我空军不易接近。敌人发射的机枪、火箭炮的弹丸，不断地落在我航空机的前后及左右侧。猛烈的空中炮火连续不绝的震动了清晨空气。
    但我们无敌的航空勇士，极巧妙的躲避了敌人射击，纵横攻击敌机，不多时就击落敌机四架，余则逃窜，获得了辉煌战果。
    该日九时五十五分，某基地接到自负为“空中堡垒”的“Ｂ２９型”机六架与驱逐机六架编队的美空军，为轰炸金浦机场和京城一带和平的城市、农村而来的情报，当即命令朝鲜英雄金基玉和黄世昌两勇士前往击退。他们奉到命令，熟练的驾驶爱机起飞，一路奔向敌机。
    此时立即发现了敌机。勇敢的朝鲜雄鹰，毫无踌躇的突入敌机队形中，开始进行攻击。十二架敌机和两架我机开始了猛烈的空中战。但在他们已掌握熟练的技术和沸腾火焰般的对祖国的热爱面前，就没有能抵抗的敌机。
    未几，因两勇士的大胆攻击，敌队形陷入混乱状态，被金基玉击中的敌机Ｂ２９型一架，喷出黑烟，摇曳丑体坠落，余机惊慌逃窜。我航空机追击甚远，完全予以击退。
    朝鲜英雄金基玉空军勇士，截止该日共击落包括Ｂ２９型的敌机九架，陆续建立了辉煌战功。
    英勇无比的我空军勇士，现仍掩护向南挺进的人民军地上部队，不断搜索敌机，继续着壮烈的空中战。（转载平壤“民主华侨”）
