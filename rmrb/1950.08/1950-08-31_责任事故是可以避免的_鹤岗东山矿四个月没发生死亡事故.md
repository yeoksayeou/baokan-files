　　Liability Accidents Are Avoidable

    Dongshan Mine in Hegang Has Not Had a Fatal Accident for Four Months

    Zhang Lide, Mine Director of Dongshan Mine in Hegang

    "Can coal mine production truly be free of fatalities?" This question has not been resolved in the minds of many coal mine cadres and miners. Workers often say: "Four stones sandwich a piece of meat; if you want to 'eat' coal, how can there be no danger?" Therefore, even though the higher authorities repeatedly emphasize safe production and strictly investigate responsibilities, many people dare not say, "I guarantee no one will die here."

    However, the facts at Dongshan Mine in Hegang powerfully prove that liability accidents are avoidable. From January to April of this year, the mine had a total of six work-related deaths (two in January, one in February, two in March, and one in April). Therefore, during Red May, the slogan "Guarantee No Fatalities" was put forward. With the efforts of all employees, no one has died in the past four months, and serious injuries have also been reduced from five per month to one. Now the mine's employees are striving for the political task of "eliminating serious injuries."

    At the beginning of the "Guarantee No Fatalities" slogan, everyone's confidence was also insufficient. In order to dispel the doubts in the minds of employees, the mine used the method of analyzing accidents and learning lessons to clear up thinking with living facts. After studying the fatal accidents that occurred this year one by one, everyone realized that the accidents were all caused by carelessness, violations of labor discipline and technical regulations, or team leaders abandoning management responsibilities. Therefore, everyone strengthened their belief that liability accidents are avoidable. At the same time, the following measures were taken to strengthen safety work:

    (1) Clearly and definitively state that preventing fatalities and reducing serious injuries is one of the monthly central tasks. Leaders conduct in-depth inspections at any time; everyone also takes this as a direction for resolute struggle in their thinking.

    (2) Implementing new coal mining methods is an important condition for reducing fatalities. Before April, most of the mine used high-fall mining methods. After April, 60% of the working faces have implemented new coal mining methods, so it is possible to concentrate efforts on dealing with fewer high-fall mining faces, and accidents have been reduced.

    (3) Implement labor discipline and technical regulations, and strengthen the responsibility system. Use past accidents for practical education, improve workers' class friendship thinking, care for each other's safety, and strengthen vigilance against accidents. For accidents that have occurred, strictly investigate responsibility and promptly deal with violations of discipline. For example, the fatal accident in March was caused by team leader Hu Daoming taking the lead in inspecting coal. Immediate and appropriate handling was taken, and the effect was significant. No fatal accidents have occurred in that pit since then.

    (4) Give specific responsibilities to technical personnel. Assign each technical person to each inclined shaft and working face to jointly be responsible with the team leaders. This makes it easier to implement technical regulations and reduce the occurrence of accidents. For example, if technical personnel find problems with gas ventilation or supports at the working face, they can immediately order the workers to stop work. At the same time, strengthening the unity between technical personnel and employees, promoting the spirit of mutual respect and humbly accepting opinions, and strengthening close cooperation between work is also an important part of eliminating accidents.

### 责任事故是可以避免的  鹤岗东山矿四个月没发生死亡事故

　　责任事故是可以避免的
    鹤岗东山矿四个月没发生死亡事故
    鹤岗东山矿矿长  张立德
    “煤矿生产到底能不能不死人？”这在许多煤矿工作干部和矿工思想中是没有解决的问题。工人们常说：“四块石头夹块肉，要想‘吃’煤，那能没危险？”因此上级一再强调安全生产，严格追查责任，许多人就不敢说“我这里保证不死人”。
    但是，鹤岗东山矿的事实，有力的证明了责任事故是可以避免的。该矿今年一至四月份，共死亡工友六名（一月二名，二月一名，三月二名，四月一名），因此在红五月时，提出“保证不死人”的口号。在全体员工努力下，四个月来没死一个人，重伤也由全月五名减为一名。现在该矿职工正为“消灭重伤”的政治任务而奋斗。
    在提出“保证不死人”的口号之初，大家的信心也是不足的。为了解除职工思想上的疑虑，该矿通过分析事故，接受教训的方法，以活的事实来打通思想。当逐一研究今年所发生的死亡事故之后，一致认识到：事故的发生都是由于疏忽大意，违反劳动纪律和技术规程，或班组长放弃管理责任所致。因而大家坚定了责任事故是可以避免的信念。同时，采取了下列加强保安工作的措施：
    （一）明确与肯定的提出不死人与减少重伤是每月中心任务之一。领导上随时深入检查；大家在思想上也以此作为坚决奋斗的方向。
    （二）实行新采煤方法是减少死亡的重要条件。四月份以前，该矿大部是高落采煤方法。四月份以后，百分之六十的掌子已实行新采煤法，因此可以集中力量对付较少的高落采煤掌子，事故得以减少。
    （三）贯彻劳动纪律与技术规程，加强责任制。用过去的事故进行实际教育，提高工人的阶级友爱思想，互相关心安全，加强对事故的警惕。对已发生的事故，则严格追查责任，并及时处理违犯纪律的现象。如三月份的死亡事故是班长胡道明领头检煤造成的，当即加以适当处理，效果很大，以后该坑未发生死亡事故。
    （四）给予技术人员以具体职责。把每个技术人员配到各个斜井和掌子里，与班组长共同负责，这样容易贯彻技术规程，减少事故发生。如技术人员发现掌子因瓦斯风或棚子有问题，便可立即令工人停止作业。同时，加强技术人员与职工间的团结，发扬互相尊重与虚心接受意见的精神，以加强工作间的密切配合，亦为消灭事故的重要一环。
