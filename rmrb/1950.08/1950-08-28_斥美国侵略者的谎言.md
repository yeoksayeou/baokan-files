　　The American aggression against Korea and the aggression against our territory of Taiwan have created a huge international crime and have been brought before world opinion and the United Nations Security Council, demanding the judgment of human justice.

　　In order to demand that the Security Council sanction the US government’s crime of armed aggression against our territory of Taiwan, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government, sent a telegram to Malik, Chairman of the United Nations Security Council, and Secretary-General Lie on August 24th, accusing the United States and suggesting that the Security Council immediately take measures to force the US government to completely withdraw its armed aggressive forces from Taiwan and other territories belonging to China.

　　To this just accusation and suggestion, the US representative, Austin, made a very shameless and feeble sophistry on August 25th.

　　Austin said: "The United States has not invaded Chinese territory, and the United States has not taken aggressive action against China." This is a complete lie. The long-standing and consistent criminal history of US aggression against China is known to the world, and the US State Department's own published "White Paper" has already proven it. There is no need to repeat these. Now, let us only consider the two pieces of evidence mentioned in Austin's letter. Truman's "statement" on June 27th of this year and his "message" to the US Congress on July 19th both announced that he "had ordered the US Seventh Fleet to prevent any attack on Taiwan." At this time, the US Seventh Fleet sailed into the Taiwan Strait, and the US Air Force also entered Taiwan. This clearly constitutes the criminal fact of direct armed aggression by the United States against our territory. Austin's statement that "the US action regarding Taiwan was taken when the island was a point of conflict with the mainland" is also a complete sophistry. Taiwan and the Chinese mainland are both our territory and have nothing to do with the United States or any other country. "The island is in conflict with the mainland" is China's internal affair. Why should the United States interfere? From this, it can be seen that the US government is now engaging in an act of aggression by interfering in China's internal affairs.

　　Austin quoted Truman's "statement," saying, "The United States has no territorial ambitions in Taiwan, nor do we seek any special status or privilege for ourselves in Taiwan." Everyone knows that this is another lie. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which is raised by the United States and despised by all the Chinese people, has always been used to seize unlimited "special status or privileges" in Chinese territory. Now, US imperialism wants to use Taiwan as its military base and colony. Regarding this conspiracy, MacArthur, the chief executor of the US invasion of Taiwan, made a public confession in his telegram to the American Veterans of Foreign Wars on August 25th. MacArthur blatantly touted that Taiwan is an indispensable part of the US Pacific "defense line." As for Austin saying that "the US actions" are "aimed at maintaining peace" and "fully comply with the spirit of the UN Charter," all of this is nonsense. The UN Charter clearly stipulates that "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations." (Article 2, paragraph 4) and stipulates that the United Nations "shall not authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." (Article 2, paragraph 7 of the same article). The actions of the United States are exactly the opposite of the spirit of the UN Charter. The United States, like with Korea, is using force to interfere in events that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of China and Korea, infringing upon the territorial integrity or political independence of China and Korea. This "US action" of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries is by no means "maintaining peace," but an act of aggression that "endangers international peace, security and justice" (Article 2, paragraph 3 of the UN Charter). How can this be denied? If the Chinese people's liberation of their territory of Taiwan, the complete elimination of the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the war between the Korean people and the Syngman Rhee group are not considered internal affairs of a country and must be interfered with by the United States, then the American Civil War should not be considered a sacred war of independence and unification, and Lincoln should be regarded as an "aggressor." Is this acceptable to the clear-headed people of the United States?

　　The arrogant and ignorant Austin continued his sophistry, saying that "the legal status of Taiwan cannot be determined until international action is taken to decide its future." This is still repeating the tone of Truman's "statement": "The determination of Taiwan's future status must await the restoration of Pacific security, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations." Truman and his mouthpiece Austin are pretending to be forgetful and accustomed to slapping themselves in the face. But Truman and Austin cannot change the justice of the world. Taiwan's status has long been determined to be part of Chinese territory. The Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, stated: "Japan will be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the First World War in 1914, and all the territories Japan has stolen from China, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, shall be returned to China." Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, also stipulates that "the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented." Even on January 5th of this year, Truman, in another statement, had to admit that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation stipulated that "territories seized by Japan from China, such as Taiwan, should be returned to China." If the territory of a country must wait until the conclusion of a peace treaty to determine its status, then there are still some countries that were once occupied by Germany or Japan, such as France, Norway, or the Philippines, which have not yet concluded a peace treaty with Germany or a peace treaty with Japan, and their territories cannot be determined either. Isn't this extremely absurd?

　　All the sophistry and lies of the American aggressors are in vain. Austin also attempted to deceive people with "people's friendship" and to waste the UN's energy by "conducting on-the-spot investigations." We want to tell Austin and those who may be deceived by Austin: The Chinese people and the American people "cherish friendship," but we have no "friendship" with the American aggressors; the fact that Taiwan is Chinese territory is as solid as iron, and it can be understood completely without "investigation."

　　Now the facts are extremely obvious. That is, the American aggressors are continuing to expand the scope of their armed aggression and continue to ignite the flames of aggression. From the direct attack on Korea by the US Navy, Army, and Air Force, it has expanded to the invasion of the territory of our People's Republic of China, Taiwan, by the US Seventh Fleet and the US Air Force. The United States attempts to take this step of expanding the war to achieve its sinister goal of dominating Asia, seriously undermining peace in Asia and the world. However, our Chinese people's determination to liberate all of our territory is unwavering. We have never feared the threat of any imperialism. The Chinese people all remember what Comrade Mao Zedong said: "No imperialist will be allowed to invade our country again." "The unyielding efforts of the Chinese people will steadily achieve their goals."

　　The Chinese people firmly support the accusations and suggestions made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the UN Security Council. We believe that it is the UN Security Council's inescapable responsibility to immediately sanction the US government’s crime of armed aggression against Chinese territory. At the same time, we resolutely demand that the United Nations immediately expel the illegal representatives of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant group from the United Nations and its Security Council, Economic and Social Council, Trusteeship Council, and other institutions, so that the formal representatives appointed by our Central People's Government, such as Zhang Wentian, Li Yimang, Zhou Shidi, Ji Chao Ding, and Meng Yongqian, can attend the UN meetings and the meetings of the Security Council and other institutions, so that the United Nations and its institutions can obtain sufficient conditions to fully restore its normal work.

### 斥美国侵略者的谎言

　　斥美国侵略者的谎言
    美国对于朝鲜的侵略和对于我国领土台湾的侵略，已经造成了一个巨大的国际罪案，并且已经被提到全世界舆论的面前和联合国安全理事会上，要求人类正义的审判了。
    为了要求安全理事会制裁美国政府武装侵略我国领土台湾的罪行，我中央人民政府周恩来外长于本月二十四日致电联合国安全理事会主席马立克及秘书长赖伊，提出对美国的控诉，并建议安理会立即采取措施，使美国政府自台湾及其他属于中国的领土完全撤出它的武装侵略部队。
    对于这个正义的控诉和建议，美国代表奥斯汀于本月二十五日做了一个非常无耻的和无力的狡辩。
    奥斯汀说：“美国并未侵犯中国领土，美国也未对中国采取侵略行动。”这完全是撒谎。美国长期一贯侵略中国的罪恶历史是举世周知的，并且已经有了美国国务院自己所发表的“白皮书”做了证明。这些都不必重述了。现在仅仅从奥斯汀的这封信所提到的两件证据来说。杜鲁门在本年六月二十七日的“声明”和在七月十九日致美国国会的“咨文”，都宣布了他“已命令美国第七舰队防止对台湾的任何攻击”。此时美国第七舰队便向我台湾海峡出动，美国空军亦随着进入台湾。这显然已经构成了美国对于我国领土的直接武装侵略的犯罪事实。奥斯汀所说“美国关于台湾的行动是当该岛是与大陆冲突的地点时采取的”也完全是一种狡辩。台湾和中国大陆同是我国领土，与美国或其他任何国家都毫无关系。“该岛与大陆冲突”，是中国的内政问题，为什么美国要出来干涉呢？由此可见，美国政府现在正是做了干涉中国内政的侵略行为。
    奥斯汀引述杜鲁门的“声明”，说什么“美国对台湾毫无领土的野心，我们也不为自己在台湾寻求任何特殊地位或特权”。谁都知道这又是说谎。美国豢养为全中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石匪帮，从来就是为了在中国领土上攫取无限的“特殊地位或特权”。现在美帝国主义更要把台湾作为它的军事基地和殖民地；关于这一阴谋，美国侵略台湾的首要执行者麦克阿瑟八月二十五日所发表的给美国参加海外作战退役军人协会的电报，正是作了一个公开的供状。麦克阿瑟公然鼓吹台湾是美国的太平洋“防线”的一个不可缺少的部分。至于奥斯汀说什么“美国的行动”，“目的在保持和平”，“完全符合联合国宪章的精神”，全是胡说。联合国宪章明白规定“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立。”（第二条第四款）并规定联合国“不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件”。（同条第七款）美国的行动恰恰和联合国宪章的精神完全违背。美国对于台湾和对于朝鲜一样，都是用武力干涉了在本质上属于中国和朝鲜国内管辖的事件，侵害了中国和朝鲜的领土完整或政治独立。这种干涉他国内政的“美国的行动”，决不是什么“保持和平”，而是“危及国际和平、安全及正义”（联合国宪章第二条第三款）的侵略行为，这难道还能够抵赖吗？如果中国人民解放自己的领土台湾、彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮残余，以及朝鲜人民和李承晚集团之间的战争，不被认为是一个国家自己内部的事情，而要由美国来干涉；那末，美国历史上的南北战争也就不能被认为是神圣的独立统一战争，而林肯就应当被认为“侵略者”了。这是美国头脑清醒的人民所能够接受的吗？
    狂妄无知的奥斯汀继续他的狡辩，说什么“台湾的合法地位，在国际上采取行动决定它的前途之前，是不能够确定的。”这仍然是重复杜鲁门“声明”的腔调：“台湾未来地位的决定，必须等待太平洋安全的恢复，对日和约的缔结，或联合国的考虑。”杜鲁门和他的喇叭奥斯汀，都是装着健忘和惯于打自己嘴巴的无赖汉。但是杜鲁门和奥斯汀究竟无法改变世界的正义。台湾的地位早已被确定了是中国领土的一部分。在一九四三年十二月一日的开罗宣言上写着：“剥夺日本自一九一四年第一次世界大战开始以后，在太平洋所夺得或占领之一切岛屿，使日本所窃取于中国之领土，例如满洲、台湾、澎湖群岛等，归还中国。”一九四五年七月二十六日波茨坦公告第八条又规定：“开罗宣言之条件必将实施。”甚至于就在本年一月五日，杜鲁门在另一个声明中，也曾经不能不承认开罗宣言和波茨坦公告所规定的“日本自中国夺去的领土如台湾应当归还中国”。如果一个国家的领土，必须等待和约缔结之后才能够确定其地位，那末，现在还有若干曾被德国或日本占领的国家，例如法国、挪威或菲律宾，因为尚未缔结对德和约或对日和约，也还不能确定它的领土。这岂不是绝顶的荒谬？
    美国侵略者的一切狡辩与撒谎，都是白费心机的。奥斯汀还企图用“人民友谊”来蒙蔽是非，并且企图用“实地进行调查”来浪费联合国的精力。我们要正告奥斯汀以及可能被奥斯汀所欺骗的人们：中国人民和美国人民是“抱着友谊”的，但是，我们对于美国侵略者则决无“友谊”可言；台湾之为中国领土是铁一般的事实，完全用不着“调查”就能明了。
    现在事实已经极为明显。这就是美国侵略者正在继续扩大它的武装侵略范围，继续烧起侵略的火焰。从美国海陆空军直接对朝鲜的进攻，扩大到以美国第七舰队和美国空军侵略我中华人民共和国的领土台湾。美国企图采取这样扩大战争的步骤，来达到它霸占亚洲的罪恶目的，严重地破坏了亚洲和世界的和平。但是，我们中国人民解放我国全部领土的决心是不会动摇的。我们从来不惧怕任何帝国主义的威胁。中国人民都记住了毛泽东同志的话：“不允许任何帝国主义者再来侵略我们的国土。”“中国人民的不屈不挠的努力必将稳步地达到自己的目的。”
    中国人民坚决支持周恩来外长向联合国安理会提出的控诉和建议。我们认为立即制裁美国政府武装侵略中国领土的罪行，是联合国安理会义不容辞的责任。与此同时，我们坚决要求联合国立即将中国国民党反动残余集团的非法代表，从联合国及其安全理事会、经济暨社会理事会、托管理事会等机构中开除出去，使我国中央人民政府所任命的张闻天、李一氓、周士第、冀朝鼎、孟用潜等正式代表出席联合国会议和安理会及其他各机构的会议，使联合国及其各机构能够获得充分的条件，全面地恢复它的正常工作。
