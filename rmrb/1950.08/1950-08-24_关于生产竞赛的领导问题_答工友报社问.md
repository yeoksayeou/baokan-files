　　On the Leadership of Production Competitions
    Answering Questions from the Worker's Daily Newspaper

Editor:

    We are currently launching a new record movement. We are not clear enough in our minds about who should lead this movement. Some say that it should be led by the administration (factory director), determining the direction, with the trade union organizing and mobilizing the masses, and the Party and the Youth League providing guarantees. Others say that it should be led by the trade union, because the new record movement is a mass movement. Still others say that it should be led by the factory management committee, because the trade union cannot do it alone, because the trade union cadres are weak and cannot handle it (trade union cadres themselves also have this idea). The administration cannot order the workers' movement; it is best for the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League to work together through the factory management committee.

    Please answer who should lead it? What is the relationship between the administration, the Party, the Youth League, and the trade union in the new record movement? How should they work?

Worker's Daily Newspaper:

    The new record movement is essentially a form of production competition. Production competition is a concrete manifestation of the new labor attitude of the working masses after liberation; it is the daily way of life and labor of the working class. Therefore, competition must be launched on the basis of mass awareness. Since competition is a broad mass work, it should be led by the workers' own organization - the trade union. As for saying that the trade union cadres are too weak to do it, this statement is incorrect. We cannot bypass the trade union work because the trade union cadres are weak; on the contrary, we should strengthen our assistance to the trade union cadres and train them so that they can gradually assume this task.

    The factory director and the factory management committee should also regard production competition as a regular and important task of organizing production, providing all possible material conditions for the competition. However, the administration's intention for production competition should be realized through the trade union organization, and should not bypass the trade union organization and replace the trade union in doing mass work.

    The trade union is under the direct leadership of the Party and is the link between the Party and the masses. Therefore, the Party's leadership over mass movements is realized through the trade union organization. The Party and the Youth League organizations should educate Party and League members to become active participants and leaders in the competition; only through the core role of Party and League members within the trade union can the mass movement be developed and consolidated. Party and League members can only play their advanced role among the masses; away from the masses, advanced elements will be isolated.

    Therefore, in the mass production competition, the organizations of the Party, the administration, and the Youth League should adopt different methods to exert their organizational strength, consolidate and strengthen the unified leadership of the trade union, and promote the increasing expansion of the competition scale and the continuous improvement of the competition results.

### 关于生产竞赛的领导问题  答工友报社问

　　关于生产竞赛的领导问题
    答工友报社问编者同志：
    现在我们正在开展新纪录运动。这个运动应该由谁来领导，我们在思想上还不够明确。有的说，应该由行政（厂长）领导，确定方针，由工会组织发动群众、党和团作保证。有的说，应该由工会来领导，因新纪录运动是群众运动。有的说，应该由工厂管理委员会领导，单靠工会搞不起来，因为工会干部能力弱，不能胜任（工会干部本身也有这种想法）。行政不能命令工人运动，最好党政工团通过工厂管理委员会共同来搞。
    请你答复一下，到底应该由谁来领导？行政、党、团、工会在新纪录运动中的关系如何？他们应该如何进行工作？
    中国兵工工会华北地区委员会工友报社工友报社：
    新纪录运动实质上就是生产竞赛的一种形式。而生产竞赛又是解放后工人群众新的劳动态度的具体表现，是工人阶级日常的生活方式和劳动方式，因此，竞赛必须在群众自觉的基础上去发动。既然竞赛是一个广泛的群众工作，那就应当由工人群众自己的组织——工会去领导。至于说工会干部弱就搞不起来，这种说法是不对的。我们不能因为工会干部弱而包办代替工会的工作，相反的应该加强对工会干部的帮助，培养他们使能逐渐担负起这一任务来。
    厂长和工厂管理委员会同样应当把生产竞赛当作组织生产的经常的重要任务之一，为竞赛提供一切可能的物质条件。但是行政对生产竞赛的意图，应该通过工会组织去实现，而不应该抛开工会组织，代替工会去做群众工作。
    工会是在党的直接领导之下，是党联系群众的纽带。因此，党对群众运动的领导都是通过工会组织去实现的。党和团的组织，都应教育党团员使成为竞赛的积极分子、带头者；通过党团员在工会内的核心作用，群众运动才可能发展与巩固。党团员也只有在群众中才能发挥它们的先进作用；离开群众，先进分子就会孤立起来。
    所以，在群众性的生产竞赛中，党、行政、青年团的组织，都应采取不同的方式发挥其组织力量，巩固与加强工会的统一领导，促使竞赛规模的日趋扩大和竞赛成绩的不断提高。
