　　The Party's Good Daughter
　　By Jiang Ping
　　(1) Zhao Guilan came from a very poor background, lost her mother when she was young, and had been a beggar. Her older brother raised her. Now, her two older brothers' wages can support the whole family, unlike before liberation when they suffered so much, but she is unwilling to stay at home and be supported by others. In early 1948, she entered a factory as a female worker.

　　(2) Since Zhao Guilan entered the factory, she has been very active in her work. Once, the nitric acid in a nitric acid bottle in the room suddenly expanded the bottle opening and started to burn. In this dangerous situation, she did not hesitate at all and rushed into the room, groping to open the window to avert the danger. However, she was injured in several places on her body. She didn't complain either.

　　(3) Because of this extraordinary work enthusiasm, she gloriously joined the Party on December 6, 1948. During the oath, she faced the Party flag and the portrait of Chairman Mao, raised her hand and said: "I am willing to advance under the banner of Chairman Mao!"

　　党的好女儿
　　江平作
　　（一）赵桂兰出身很贫苦，从小就没有了娘，曾讨过饭。哥哥把她抚养大的。现在两个哥哥的工薪能养活全家人，不像解放前那样受苦，但她不愿在家闲着呌别人养活。一九四八年初她进入了工厂当女工。
　　（二）自从赵桂兰进了工厂之后，工作非常积极。有一次，屋内硝酸瓶里的硝酸忽然把瓶口涨开燃烧起来。在这种危险情况下，她没有丝毫迟疑，冲进屋里去，摸索着把窗子打开免去了危险。可是她身上好几处受了伤。她也不抱怨。
　　（三）由于这种非凡的工作热情，她在一九四八年十二月六日光荣地参加了党。宣誓时，她面向党旗与毛主席像，高举着手说：“我愿在毛主席的旗帜下前进！”
