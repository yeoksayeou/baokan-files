Xinhua News Agency, New York, 5th: Progressive organizations in the United States, including the Communist Party of the United States, the Progressive Party, the Labor Party, the Civil Rights Congress, the American Communications Association, and the Independent Employees Union, are protesting angrily against the brutal attack by New York police on peaceful demonstrators in Union Square on August 2nd.
    Progressive Party Secretary Baldwin wrote to Truman, demanding guarantees of "the civil rights to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue by peaceful means and to declare the atomic bomb illegal." Baldwin also wrote to New York Mayor O'Dwyer, denouncing him for ordering a bloody attack on peace defenders, thereby violating basic democratic rights.
    American Labor Party Secretary Shuzel also wrote to O'Dwyer to express his protest.
    Thompson, chairman of the New York State Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, issued a statement, pointing out that the peace demonstration in Union Square was a heroic manifestation of the determination of American workers to save the world from the great destruction of an atomic war. This significant American peace movement will strengthen the confidence of the American and global peace forces. O'Dwyer's ban and the subsequent police brutality demonstrate that Truman, Dulles, and big business in the United States are attempting to expand the war of aggression. For this reason, fascism is bound to develop at home.
    Thompson urged the establishment of the broadest possible front for peace. He called for intensified unified movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Peace Appeal, and to change Truman-Acheson-Dulles' policy of moving towards atomic war into a policy of moving towards world peace.
    Thompson stated that the Communist Party is prepared to unite with all other Americans to fight together for a just solution to the Korean issue, to prevent a world atomic war, and to stop the rise of fascism in the United States.

    抗议美政府蛮横镇压和平运动
    汤普生号召建立最广泛的争取和平战线
    并争取在公正的基础上解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社纽约五日消息：美国共产党、进步党、劳工党、民权保障大会、美国电讯协会和独立职员联盟等进步组织。愤怒地抗议八月二日纽约警察对联合广场和平示威游行者的蛮横袭击。
    进步党书记鲍尔温致书杜鲁门，要求保障“以和平方法谋求和平解决朝鲜问题和宣布原子弹为非法的公民权利”。鲍尔温同时并致书纽约市长奥德威耶，斥责他下令对保卫和平者进行血腥袭击从而侵犯基本的民主权利。
    美国劳工党书记舒泽尔也致书奥德威耶表示抗议。
    美国共产党纽约州委员会主席汤普生发表声明，指出联合广场的和平示威，是美国工人决心要使世界免于原子战争大毁灭的英勇表现，这一重大的美国和平运动，将增强美国与全世界和平力量的信心。奥德威耶的禁令及其后的警察暴行，说明杜鲁门、杜勒斯以及美国的大企业企图扩大侵略战争。为此，在国内就必然走向法西斯主义。
    汤普生敦促建立最广泛的争取和平的战线。他号召加紧斯德哥尔摩和平宣言征集签名的统一的运动，并把杜鲁门——艾奇逊——杜勒斯的走向原子战争的政策改变为走向世界和平的政策。
    汤普生表示共产党准备与一切其他美国人团结起来，共同奋斗，争取在公正的基础上解决朝鲜问题，阻止世界原子战争及制止法西斯在美国的兴起。
