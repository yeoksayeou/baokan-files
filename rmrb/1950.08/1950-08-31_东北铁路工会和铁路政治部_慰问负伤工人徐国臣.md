The Northeast Railway Trade Union and the Railway Political Department
    Express Condolences to Injured Worker Xu Guochen
    [This News Report] The Northeast Regional Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union and the Northeast Railway Political Department jointly wrote a letter of condolence to Xu Guochen, a railway worker from the Linjiang Locomotive Depot who was injured by strafing from American aircraft. The text of the letter of condolence is as follows:
    To the Linjiang Locomotive Depot Trade Union, forwarded to Comrade Xu Guochen:
    On August 27th, military aircraft of American imperialism, which is invading Korea, unreasonably violated our country's airspace and strafed our railway stations and vehicles, causing you to be unfortunately injured while working. In addition to severely protesting this barbaric act by American imperialism, we are writing to express our sincere condolences to you. All railway workers in Northeast China have increased their deeper and greater resentment towards American imperialism because of your injury. We must transform this resentment into practical strength, improve production, and increase transportation efficiency, using victories on the production front to completely defeat the American aggressors. We hope you will rest and recuperate with peace of mind, recover your health as soon as possible, and rejoin the battle on the production front.
    Sincerely,
    Northeast Regional Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union
    Northeast Railway Political Department
    August 29th
