　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th. The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held a meeting on the eve of the "August 15th" fifth anniversary of liberation, unanimously passed a letter to the entire Korean people, and decided to launch a signature campaign of all Korean people in support of the letter.

　　The letter to the people begins by stating: Foreign interference in Korea has been going on for two months. The troops of the American interventionists are massacring our sons and daughters, American warships are bombarding our coasts, and American aircraft are daily carrying out bestial attacks on our cities and villages, killing peaceful residents, and destroying factories, enterprises, railways, and houses that the Korean people have rebuilt.

　　The letter to the people points out: If it were not for the aggression of the American imperialists, the Korean people would now be able to engage in peaceful labor. Our people would not have to shed blood, and the war provoked by the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang would have already ended. The American imperialists are the most ferocious enemies of the Korean people, the enemies of peace, and the instigators of war.

　　The letter to the people calls on the people of North and South Korea to rise up together and fight for the final victory in completely expelling the interventionists from our territory. At the same time, it calls on all patriots to sign the following statement of the Korean people:

　　1. We demand that the United Nations immediately stop the armed intervention of the United States and immediately take measures to withdraw the troops of foreign interventionists from Korea.

　　2. We believe that Syngman Rhee, Lee Bum Suk, Kim Seong Su, Shin Sung Mo, Cho Byeong Ok, Baek Seong Uk, Yoon Chi Young, Shin Heung Woo, Shin Ik Hee, Jang Myeon, and others, who, under the instigation of American imperialism, launched a civil war in Korea and actively helped the interventionists in the struggle against the Korean people, must be handed over to the people's public trial as traitors to the Korean people.

　　朝鲜祖国战线发表告人民书
    号召全国人民奋起驱逐美国干涉者
    要求联合国制止美国侵略并公审人民叛徒李承晚等
    【新华社平壤十七日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会于“八·一五”解放五周年纪念日的前夕召开会议，一致通过了告全朝鲜人民书，并决定展开全朝鲜人民支持该书的签名运动。
    告人民书首称：外国干涉朝鲜已有两个月了。美国干涉者的军队虐杀着我们的儿女，美国军舰炮轰着我国的海岸，美国飞机逐日对我国的城市和农村进行兽性的袭击，杀害和平的居民，破坏着朝鲜人民修复起来的工厂、企业、铁道、住宅。
    告人民书指出：假若没有美帝国主义者的侵略，那么朝鲜人民现在已能从事和平的劳动。我们人民就不至于流血，李承晚卖国匪帮所挑拨的战争就会业已结束。美帝国主义者是朝鲜人民最凶恶的仇敌，是和平的敌人，是战争挑拨者。
    告人民书号召南北朝鲜人民一致奋起，为从我国疆土完成驱逐干涉者争取最后胜利而斗争。同时号召全体爱国者要在如下的朝鲜人民的声明上签名：
    一、我们要求联合国立即制止美国的武装干涉，立即采取措施，使外国干涉者的军队撤出朝鲜。
    二、我们认为在美帝国主义者的指使下，在朝鲜发动内战并在反对朝鲜人民的斗争中，积极帮助干涉者的李承晚、李范奭、金性洙、申性模、赵炳玉、白性郁、尹致暎、申兴雨、申翼熙、张勉等，必须当作朝鲜人民的叛徒交由人民公审。
