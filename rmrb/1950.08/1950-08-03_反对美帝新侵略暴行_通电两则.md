　　Telegrams Protesting New Acts of Aggression by U.S. Imperialism
    To the Working Committee of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace:
    U.S. imperialism is openly supporting the Lee Seung-man puppet clique, the instigator of the Korean civil war, with its naval, land, and air forces, and is brazenly interfering in the Korean civil war. It has shamelessly announced naval control of Taiwan, adventurously interfering in the just war of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan.

    This further act of aggression by U.S. imperialism in interfering in Asian affairs can only arouse the resentment and forceful resistance of the Chinese people and the people of other countries.

    We, representing the members of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society in the entire Xinjiang, resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement and Chairman Mao's instructions. We firmly oppose the U.S. imperialists' bandit-like behavior of armed obstruction of our country's liberation of Taiwan and aggression against the Korean people. We call on the people of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society in Xinjiang to unite more closely, defend peace, oppose aggression, and fully support the liberation of Taiwan.

    We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, the heroic Chinese people and their long-tempered, brave, and battle-tested People's Liberation Army are fully confident and capable of defeating any provocation by U.S. imperialism. No matter to what extent the insane brutality of U.S. imperialism develops, final victory will surely belong to the Chinese people, the Korean people, and all the people of Asia and the world.
                Xinjiang People's Democratic League General Association China Committee for the Defense of Peace

    After hearing Truman's aggressive statement of June 27th, we unanimously believe that the U.S. imperialists' interference in the Korean civil war, military assistance to the reactionary governments of Vietnam and the Philippines, and naval control of Taiwan are acts of aggression against the people of Asia, fully exposing the true face of imperialism. From this, it is clear that U.S. imperialism is the destroyer of world peace and the mortal enemy of peace-loving people. We, the representatives of youth of ten ethnic groups, express our unanimous protest against Truman's statement on behalf of all students.

    In the future, in addition to heightening our vigilance and strengthening our studies, we will unite as one, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, eliminate the remaining bandits and special agents, and do our utmost to stop new wars. In addition to signing the peace declaration, we hereby send a telegram to express our determination.

　　反对美帝新侵略暴行
    通电两则中国保卫世界和平大会工作委员会鉴：
    美帝公然以海陆空军支持朝鲜内战祸首李承晚傀儡集团、武装干涉朝鲜内战，无耻地宣布以海军控制台湾，冒险地干涉中国人民解放台湾的正义战争。
    美帝国主义这进一步干涉亚洲事务的侵略行为，只能激起中国人民以及其他各国人民的愤恨和有力的反抗。
    我们代表全新疆的各族各界盟员，坚决拥护周恩来外长的严正声明和毛主席的指示，坚决反对美帝武装阻挠我国解放台湾和侵略朝鲜人民的强盗行为，并号召全疆各族各界人民，更加紧密地团结起来，保卫和平，反对侵略，全力支援解放台湾。
    我们坚信，在中国共产党及伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，英勇的中国人民及其久经锻炼勇敢善战的人民解放军，完全有把握有信心击败美帝的任何挑衅。不管美帝的疯狂暴性发展到什么地步；最后胜利一定属于中国人民，朝鲜人民及全亚洲全世界人民的。
                新疆人民民主同盟总会中国保卫和平大会委员会
    我们听到杜鲁门六月廿七日的侵略声明后，我们一致认为：美帝国主义者干涉朝鲜内战，军事援助越南菲律宾反动政府，并以海军控制台湾，是与亚洲人民为敌的侵略行为，完全暴露了帝国主义的真相，由此可见，美帝国主义是世界和平的破坏者，是爱好和平人民的死敌，我们十个民族青年代表全体同学，对杜鲁门的声明表示一致抗议。
    今后我们除提高警惕，加强学习外，并团结一致，支持人民解放军解放台湾，消灭残余匪特，全力制止新战争，我们除签名和平宣言外，特通电表示决心。
