　　To the Editor:
　　After the People's Garden published on June 4th the reader's letter regarding the embezzlement and waste by cadres and the false reporting of outstanding autumn public grain payments in Diwa Village, Fifth District, Qingfeng County, during the filling out of land certificates, we immediately dispatched personnel to conduct an in-depth investigation together with the district cadres. The course of events is basically true.

　　After investigation, we immediately conducted profound education for the masses and cadres based on policy and in combination with the opinions of the masses, and determined the following handling methods:

　　(1) The wasted expenditure will be the responsibility of the cadres who handled the expenditure to return the amount.

　　(2) The village cadres sold three fruit-bearing trees belonging to the masses when filling out the land certificates, which should be handled in combination with the opinions of the masses.

　　(3) The village cadres privately apportioned an extra one catty and two taels of public grain per mu to the masses, which is a violation of the law and should be dealt with according to law.

　　(4) False reporting of outstanding public grain payments is an act of infringing upon the interests of the people, and the cadres who handled the expenditure are ordered to pay all of it during the summer harvest.

　　The disclosure of this reader's letter in People's Garden has raised our vigilance, strengthened our understanding of leadership work, and helped us to complete the important tasks given to us by the state and the people. We are very grateful.

　　编辑同志：
    六月四日人民园地发表清丰县五区堤洼村在填写土地证时，干部贪污浪费、假报去秋公粮尾欠事以后，我们立即派人会同该区区干部深入了解。事情的经过基本上是真实的。
    经调查以后，我们即根据政策，结合群众意见，进一步向群众及干部进行深刻的教育，并定出如下的处理办法：
    （一）开支浪费部分，由经手开支的干部负责退出。
    （二）在填写土地证时，村干部卖掉群众三棵果实树，应结合群众意见处理。
    （三）该村干部私向群众每亩多摊派一斤二两公粮，这是违反法令的，应依法处理。
    （四）假报公粮尾欠，是侵害人民利益的行为，责令经手开支干部于夏收时全部纳交。
    人民园地披露了这一读者信件，提高了我们的警惕性，加强了我们对领导工作的认识，并帮助我们来完成国家和人民给我们的重大任务。我们是很感激的。
