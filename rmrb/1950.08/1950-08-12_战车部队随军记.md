    Accompanying the Tank Unit
    Korean Central News Agency Correspondent
    [Editor's Note] The following news dispatch from the Korean battlefield is a report from a Korean Central News Agency correspondent accompanying a tank unit from the Imjin River to the Geum River, originally excerpted from the July 30th "Fighter News."

    The Korean People's Army's pride of the front lines—the tank unit—shakes the earth, advancing southward as if entering a no-man's land.

    For over ten days, this reporter has accompanied this mobile fortress that makes the enemy flee in terror—the brave tank unit. This reporter followed Ren Zaihan (transliteration), a tank platoon leader of the Cui Yishu (transliteration) detachment under the tank division of our People's Army. After counterattacking the Li Chengwan puppet army on June 25th, they suddenly attacked Changfeng in Hwanghae Province, initiating their first battle. Our army's tank and infantry units, launching a counteroffensive, captured Kaesong in one fell swoop, pursuing the retreating enemy. The enemy fled in panic to the Imjin River, attempting to stubbornly resist on the fortified positions already built on the opposite bank of the Imjin River. Due to the fierce attacks of our tank unit, the enemy lost their ability to resist. Before crossing the river, the defending forces on the opposite bank destroyed the Imjin River bridge, and the remaining "national defense forces," losing their retreat, were completely wiped out in the Changdan area by the combined attack of our tank and infantry units.

    Of course, crossing the Imjin River was not easy. The bridge had been destroyed, and the enemy forces concentrated on the opposite bank attempted to hinder our crossing with various artillery fires.

    It seemed almost impossible for the tank unit to cross the river, but delaying the crossing operation would give the enemy a chance to reorganize their forces, increasing our army's losses. At this time, the infantry unit was ordered to forcibly cross the river. The tank and artillery units concentrated all their firepower to bombard the enemy's artillery positions on the opposite bank, covering the infantry unit. Our infantry vanguard bravely began to cross the Imjin River despite the rain of bullets. At the same time, the engineering unit boldly and carefully repaired the destroyed bridge.

    Our army's vanguard successfully crossed the Imjin River and occupied the bridgehead on the opposite bank. The infantry units continuing to cross the river launched a brave bayonet charge without interruption, destroying the enemy's concentrated fire and expanding the bridgehead, ensuring our army's continued crossing. At this time, although the engineering unit was under constant enemy artillery fire, they still repaired the bridge to allow the tanks to cross, and our tank and infantry main forces, which had been waiting for the opportune time to cross the river, launched a fierce attack all the way to Seoul.

    After our army broke through the enemy's defense line on the Imjin River, the enemy retreated in a panic to the Munsan area, making a last-ditch effort in the fortresses already built, attempting to stop our army's advance on Seoul.

    A fierce battle began in front of the Munsan highlands. After the enemy deployed on the highlands in front of Munsan and the highlands to the left, they shelled even more fiercely from within the solid fortresses. Our tank unit, on the one hand, restrained the enemy on the highlands to the left, and on the other hand, broke through the highlands in front, flanking the enemy's rear, cutting off the enemy's retreat. Under the cover of our artillery fire, the infantry unit launched a brave assault, capturing the Munsan highlands in one fell swoop and rushing into the Munsan city area.

    The enemy, cut off from their retreat, abandoned their weapons and fled to the mountainous area behind Munsan. The area behind Munsan was a key point for the enemy to defend Seoul. In addition to the remnants of the 12th and 13th regiments, the enemy, who had originally been entrenched in this mountainous area, also brought in two more regiments to put up stubborn resistance, attempting to stop our army's advance and gain time to defend Seoul. Therefore, the enemy's resistance was very stubborn. In addition, this area was extremely unfavorable for our army's tanks to advance, with only narrow roads passable for tanks and highlands on both sides. The only road that could be advanced was this narrow valley, with higher terrain about two kilometers ahead of this narrow valley. However, our army's tanks had to pass through this narrow valley, so our army formulated a careful plan.

    The tank unit would forcibly break through the narrow valley, the infantry unit would occupy the highlands on the left and right sides and sweep away the enemy. The tank unit would strengthen artillery fire on the enemy on the left and right sides while beginning to break through the attack.

    The attack began immediately. The brave infantry unit crawled up the mountainous area, but the enemy used the night to line up tanks and armored vehicles in front and began a counterattack, launching a battle between tanks. Of course, the enemy's tank resistance was useless. Under the artillery fire of our tanks, the enemy's vanguard tanks were continuously destroyed, and the enemy was completely shaken.

    Our advancing infantry unit completely wiped out the enemy. At dawn, the enemy's stubbornly resisting defense line had been completely destroyed, and the enemy began to flee again. The next day, our forward outpost tanks discovered a jeep fleeing towards Seoul on the highway. It is said that this was the vehicle of the enemy's division commander, but when our tank unit broke into the enemy's concentration area, the heavy artillery unit, headed by the enemy's staff headquarters, had not yet begun to flee and was preparing to run away. Our army immediately launched a fierce encirclement and annihilation battle. Our army attacked the remaining enemy like lightning, and the enemy fled, abandoning heavy artillery and various ammunition and food. Our army seized many spoils of war, and many enemies were wiped out in this encirclement and annihilation battle.

    That day at dawn, we heard the news that another unit of our army had liberated Seoul.

    The soldiers of Ren Zaihan's tank unit leisurely reorganized their forces, passed through Seoul, and continued to advance south. Platoon Leader Ren Zaihan bravely carried out the task of first-line reconnaissance in the battles to liberate Suwon and Jeonui. This steel force became even more active and unhindered.

    On a certain evening in July, the enemy set fire to Jeonui City and fled to the highlands about four kilometers behind Jeonui, occupying favorable terrain in an attempt to put up stubborn resistance. This area was connected to the highlands on the left and another highland on the right. Our army's forward tank unit, some infantry units, and reconnaissance pioneers began to continue their attack. There were about a thousand American soldiers, including Japanese soldiers, on the third highland to the right. In the rear valley area, more than fifty American vehicles, tanks, armored vehicles, various ammunition, and food were discovered. At this time, our army's morale and fighting will were extremely high.

    Platoon Leader Ren Zaihan of the tank unit encountered the American mechanized unit for the first time at this time. Our army troops boldly decided to capture all the enemies alive, so they first used a small force to detour to the third highland that night, arriving in front of the enemy's concentrated motor vehicle unit, waiting for dawn. The infantry unit had already approached the enemy's third line during the night. At this time, the enemy realized that our army was approaching them, but relying on their superior forces, they began a large-scale counterattack with tanks and armored vehicles. Our tanks lured the enemy to a place fifteen meters away from our army, and then the tank artillery began firing, destroying the tanks in front in one fell swoop. Three tanks were destroyed in an instant. The frightened American troops hurriedly turned around and began to flee. Our tanks immediately pursued the enemy without missing the opportunity. The panicked enemy left their tanks, armored vehicles, and cars behind, fleeing along the mountainous area. On the other hand, the enemies on the third line of highlands quickly surrendered after a bayonet charge by our brave infantry unit. In the battle on that day, our army troops, with a small force, annihilated more than 700 American troops, captured more than 500 alive, and seized twelve tanks, fifty cars, various artillery pieces, food, ammunition, and many other spoils of war, achieving brilliant results. From then on, Platoon Leader Ren Zaihan of the tank unit continued to sweep away the fleeing enemies and advanced south to Jochiwon. They also won a glorious victory in the Battle of Jochiwon.

    When Platoon Leader Ren Zaihan of the tank unit crossed the Geum River to participate in the Gongju operation, this reporter parted ways with this tank unit.

    战车部队随军记
　　朝鲜中央通讯社特派员
    【编者按】下面一篇朝鲜战地通讯，系朝鲜中央通讯社特派员随战车部队从临津江到锦江的报道，原截七月三十日的“斗士新闻”。
    朝鲜人民军的足以自豪的前线宠儿——战车部队，震动着大地，如入无人之境似的向南挺进。
    记者随从这一使敌人望风而逃的活动保垒——勇敢的战车部队已经有十几天了。记者随从的我人民军战车师团崔乙淑（译音）区分队所属的任在汉（译音）战车小队长，六月二十五日反击李承晚傀儡军后，突然向黄海道长丰方面进攻，开始初次的战斗。开始反攻的我军战车部队和步兵部队，一举占领开城，追击败退的敌人。敌人慌乱逃到临津江，企图在临津江对岸早已筑成的坚固阵地上顽强抵抗。由于我军战车部队的猛烈进击，敌人失掉抵抗力量，而在渡河之前，对岸守军又把临津江桥破坏了，失去退路的残余的“国防军”，在长湍地区受我军战车部队和步兵部队的夹击，而完全被扫荡了。
    当然，渡过临津江是不容易的事，桥梁已遭受破坏，集中在对岸的敌军又以各种炮火企图阻碍我军渡江。
    战车部队渡江几乎是不可能了，但是，延缓渡江作战，又将使敌人获得机会整备队伍，而增加我军损失。这时，步兵部队奉命强行渡江，于是战车部队和炮兵部队集中全部炮火向对岸敌人的炮兵阵地轰击，掩护了步兵部队。我步兵前卫部队冒着弹雨，开始勇敢地越渡临津江，同时，工兵部队大胆细心地修好被毁的桥梁。
    我军前卫部队成功地渡过临津江，占领了对岸的桥头堡。继续渡江的步兵部队无间隙地展开勇敢的肉搏冲锋战，摧毁敌人的集中射击，扩大桥头堡阵地，保障了我军继续渡江。这时，工兵部队虽受敌人不断的炮击，但仍然修好了使战车渡江的桥梁，争取适时渡江的我战车部队和步兵主力部队，一路猛烈进攻汉城。
    临津江敌人防御线被我击破后，敌人即狼狈万状，败退至文山一带，在早已筑成的堡垒里作最后的挣扎，企图阻止我军进攻汉城。
    文山高地前方开始了激战，敌人在文山前面高地和左面高地布阵后，在坚固的堡垒里，炮击更猛烈了。我战车部队一方面牵制住左面高地的敌人，一方面突破前方高地迂回敌人后方，遮断敌人退路，我军炮火掩护下，步兵部队展开勇敢的突击战，一举占领文山高地，冲入文山市区。
    被切断退路的敌人连武器都放弃了，逃到文山背后的山岳地带。文山背后一带是敌人守备汉城的要地，敌人原来盘据在此山岳地带的，除第十二、十三团残余外，又调来两个团作顽强的抵抗，企图阻止我军进攻，获得时间防守汉城。因此敌方的抵抗很顽强。此外，这一地区极不利于我军战车前进，仅能通过战车的狭窄道路，两侧有高地。唯一可以进军的道路就是这个狭谷，距此狭谷前方约二公里处，有更高的地形。可是我军战车不能不过此狭谷，于是我军制定了周密的计划。
    战车部队将强行突进狭谷，步兵部队将占领左右侧面高地，并将进行扫荡敌人，战车部队一面向左右侧面的敌人加强炮火射击，一面开始突破进攻。
    进攻立即开始了。勇敢的步兵部队匍匐冲上山岳地带，但是敌人利用深夜将战车及装甲车排在前面，并开始反攻，展开了战车与战车之间的战斗。当然敌人战车的抵抗是无用的，在我军战车炮轰之下，敌前卫战车连续被摧毁，敌人全面动摇了。
    我挺进的步兵部队完全扫荡了敌人。黎明时，顽强抵抗的敌人防御阵地，已毁灭殆尽，敌人又开始逃跑了。我前哨战车于翌日在公路上发现了向汉城逃走的吉普车一辆，据说这是敌师团长逃跑的车，但是我战车部队突入敌人集中地带时，以敌军参谋部为首的重炮部队还未开始逃跑，正在准备跑掉，我军立即展开了激烈的包围歼灭战。我军如闪电般进击残余敌人，敌人丢下重炮和各种弹药及粮食等逃跑。我军缴获很多战利品，这次包围歼灭战中扫荡了很多敌人。
    当天黎明我们听到了我军另一部队已经解放汉城的消息。
    任在汉战车部队战士们悠然的整备队伍经过汉城继续向南挺进。任在汉小队长在水原解放战斗和全义解放战斗中，勇敢地进行着第一线侦察的任务。这一支钢铁部队是更加纵横无阻的活跃起来了。
    七月某日晚，敌人把全义市放火焚烧了，并且逃到全义后方四公里一带高地，占据有利地形企图作顽强抵抗。这一地带左面接连着高地，右面还有一个高地，我军前卫战车部队，若干的步兵部队及侦察兵先锋开始继续进击，右面第三高地有包括日本兵在内的美军约千余名。在后方溪谷地带并发现了美军汽车五十余辆，战车、装甲车，各种弹药及食粮，这时我军的士气和战斗意志极其昂扬。
    任在汉战车小队长这时才初次遇到了美军机械化部队。我军部队大胆地决心把敌人全部活捉，便首先以小兵力于当夜迂回到第三高地，到达敌人集中的汽车部队前方，等候着天亮。步兵部队则利用深夜已迫近敌人的第三线。这时敌人发觉我军迫近他们面前，但他们倚仗自己优势兵力，用战车和装甲车开始大举反攻，我们的战车将敌人诱至距我军十五米的地点，然后战车炮开始了射击，一举消灭了前面的战车。转瞬间即击破了三辆战车。受惊的美军急转方向开始逃跑。我军战车即毫不失时的追击敌人。魂飞魄散的敌人将战车、装甲车和汽车等都丢在后面，沿着山岳地带逃跑。另一方面第三线高地的敌人经我勇敢步兵部队与之肉搏，即迅速投降。当天战斗的我军部队，以少数兵力，击灭美军七百多名，活捉五百多名，缴获战车十二辆，汽车五十辆，各种炮、食粮、弹药等很多战利品，获得灿烂的战果。从此以后任在汉战车小队长还继续扫荡了逃走的敌人，并南进到鸟致院。在鸟致院战斗中也得到光辉的胜利。
    任在汉战车小队长渡锦江参加公州作战时，记者就和这战车部队分别了。
