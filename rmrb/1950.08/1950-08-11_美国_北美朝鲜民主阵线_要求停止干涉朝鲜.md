Supporting the Just Struggle of the Korean People!

　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 8th: The "North American Korean Democratic Front" has issued a declaration to the American people, urging them to demand that the US government immediately cease armed intervention in the Korean civil war and the barbaric bombing of peaceful Korean residents by US aircraft.
　　The declaration stated: "The current Korean War is an eruption of the volcano of resentment of the entire Korean patriotic people against the Syngman Rhee regime."
　　The declaration listed in detail the crimes committed by Syngman Rhee against the Korean people.
　　The declaration concluded: "The current Korean War is a revolutionary war of the Korean people to reunify their divided country. Therefore, it is a domestic dispute, not an international event. Therefore, no foreign country has any reason to interfere in the Korean people's domestic affairs. The US government's intervention is unreasonable, and American children are making unnecessary sacrifices. Lasting world peace can only be maintained when the right to self-determination of every nation and the freedom to seek happiness for all are fully guaranteed."

　　美国“北美朝鲜民主阵线”要求停止干涉朝鲜
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约八日电：“北美朝鲜民主阵线”向美国人民发表宣言，敦促他们要求美国政府立即停止武装干涉朝鲜内战，及美国飞机对朝鲜和平居民的野蛮轰炸。
    宣言称：“目前的朝鲜战争，是潜伏着的全体朝鲜爱国人民对李承晚政权的愤恨的火山的爆发。”
    宣言详细列举李承晚对朝鲜人民所犯罪行。
    宣言在结语中说：“目前的朝鲜战争是朝鲜人民要把他们的分裂的国家重新统一起来的革命战争。因此，它是国内争执，而不是国际事件。因此，任何外国都毫无理由干涉朝鲜人民的家务纠纷。美国政府的干涉是不合理的，美国孩子们正在作无谓的牺牲。只有当每一民族的自决权，及为一切人寻求幸福的自由获得充分保证时，永久的世界和平才能够保持。”
