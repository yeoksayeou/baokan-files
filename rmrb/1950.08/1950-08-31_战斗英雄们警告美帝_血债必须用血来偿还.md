　　Combat Heroes Warn the American Empire
　　Blood Debt Must Be Paid in Blood
　　[Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army have protested the provocative actions of the U.S. Air Force in violating our Northeastern airspace.
　　The Guangxi Military Region is currently holding its first Heroes and Model Workers Conference. Upon hearing the news of American planes invading our airspace and massacring our people, Bao Wenting, a combat hero who performed a special meritorious service during the Changchun Outer Defense Campaign in the Northeast Liberation War, said indignantly: "If American imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against our country, we are willing to immediately go to the front lines and fight to the end to defend our motherland!" More than 170 combat heroes and model workers attending the conference unanimously signed a declaration: "We are soldiers of the motherland. In the Liberation War, we defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by American imperialism. We have even greater strength to defend our motherland and protect the present and future happiness of the people. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to the U.S. government. We also warn American imperialism: Blood debts must be paid in blood."
　　A certain corps stationed in Shaanxi is also holding a Heroes and Model Workers Conference. When the news of the American plane provocation arrived, the heroes and model workers attending the conference were extremely indignant. Lu Shunbao and Ma Wanxin, special-class combat heroes of the corps, jointly wrote an article stating: "We vow to fight to the end to defend our motherland's territory, airspace, and territorial waters, defend world peace, and oppose imperialist aggression."
　　[Report from this newspaper] Commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing angrily protested the aggressive actions of American planes in the Northeast. When this news reached the various units on the 28th, the hearts of the commanders and fighters were immediately ignited with the fire of anger. One soldier said: "This is enough to make my stomach explode with anger." At a symposium held by the 4th Team of the Provost Marshal, model worker Liu Ye said: "The American imperialists are ruthless wolves, flailing around blindly. They invaded Korea, invaded our Taiwan, and now they've come to our Northeast. We must teach them a lesson!" Production model worker Qiu Shuyuan believes that American imperialism is nothing to be afraid of. He said: "We have powerful armed forces, the support of the broad masses of the people, and the leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Victory will always belong to us. If American imperialism dares to provoke us, it will not gain any advantage."

    血债必须用血来偿还
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：人民解放军的战斗英雄们纷纷抗议美国空军侵犯我东北领空的挑衅行为。
    广西军区正在举行首届英雄模范大会，一听到美机侵入我国领空残杀我国人民的消息时，曾经参加解放东北长春外围战役立过特等功的战斗英雄包文庭愤慨地说：“美国帝国主义如果敢于发动对我国的侵略战争，我们愿意立即到最前线去，为保卫祖国而斗争到底！”与会的一百七十余名战斗英雄和模范工作者一致签名宣誓：“我们是祖国的战士，我们在解放战争中击溃了美国帝国主义支持下的蒋介石匪帮，我们更有力量保卫祖国，保护全国人民现在和将来的幸福。我们坚决支持周外长向美国政府提出的严重抗议，我们同时向美国帝国主义提出警告：血债必须要用血来偿还。”
    驻陕西某兵团也正在举行英雄模范大会。美机挑衅的消息传到后，参加大会的英雄模范们对此事极为愤慨。该兵团特等战斗英雄吕顺保、马万新联名著文称：“我们誓为保卫祖国的领土、领空、领海，保卫世界和平，反对帝国主义的侵略而奋斗到底。”
    【本报讯】人民解放军驻北京部队的指战员们愤怒地抗议美国飞机在东北的侵略行为。当二十八日这一消息传到各部队时，指战员们的心立即为愤怒之火所燃烧着。一位战士说：真要把肚子都气崩了。纠察总队第四队召开的座谈会上，工作模范刘业发言说：美帝这个狠心狼，蒙着眼睛瞎扑腾。它侵略朝鲜，侵略我们的台湾，这下又搞到咱们东北来了，非要给它一个教训不可！生产模范邱树元认为，美帝是没有什么可怕的。他说：我们有强大的武装力量，有广大人民的拥护，还有中央和毛主席的领导，胜利就永远是属于我们。美帝如果敢来挑衅，它一定得不到一点好处。
