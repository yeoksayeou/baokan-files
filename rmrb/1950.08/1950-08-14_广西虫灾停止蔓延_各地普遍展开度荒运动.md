Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 13th: Guangxi Province's broad masses of farmers, under the leadership of the People's Government, have achieved preliminary success in their struggle against the disaster. Since the beginning of summer, most parts of the province have suffered from floods, droughts, insect pests, hail and other disasters, with a total affected area of more than two million mu and about one million disaster victims. In response to this situation, the Provincial People's Government and the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in arranging summer and autumn disaster relief work, have adhered to the principles of production for self-salvation, mutual assistance through thrift, and government relief, and have vigorously led the masses in disaster areas to fight against various disasters. People's Governments in various disaster-stricken areas have generally, through representative conferences of all sectors, or by forming work teams to go to the countryside, actively led farmers to plant and harvest early-maturing crops. It is estimated that before the autumn harvest, the Guilin area alone can harvest two million catties of early-maturing crops. In areas with serious insect plagues, the People's Government focused on leading and organizing people from all walks of life to quickly concentrate their efforts to eliminate insect pests. After insect plagues were discovered in Xing'an, Lingchuan, Guanyang and other counties, the local People's Governments immediately sent a large number of cadres to go deep into the rural areas. After widespread propaganda and education, breaking down the feudal superstitions of farmers who believed that insect pests were "divine insects" or "the will of Heaven," the cadres personally took the lead in launching insect catching and seedling cultivation movements. In Binyang County, six insect catching teams composed of students and women were formed, and 330,000 insects were captured within three days. At present, the spread of insect plagues in various places has been stopped, and some counties and districts have been eliminated. In order to help the people in the severely affected areas to successfully overcome the summer famine, the Provincial People's Government has focused on allocating three million catties of relief grain to help the disaster victims save themselves through production. At present, the disaster relief movement has been universally launched in various places. The masses have full confidence in overcoming various summer disasters under the leadership of the People's Government.

　　广西虫灾停止蔓延
    各地普遍展开度荒运动
    【新华社汉口十三日电】广西省广大农民在人民政府领导下与灾荒斗争已获初步成绩。入夏以来，该省大部地区连遭水旱虫雹等灾，受灾面积达二百万亩以上，灾民约一百万左右。省人民政府及中共广西省委针对此种情况，在布置夏秋救灾工作时本生产自救、节约互助和政府救济的方针，大力领导灾区群众与各种灾荒搏斗。各受灾地区人民政府一般均通过各界代表会议，或组成工作队下乡，积极领导农民多种早熟作物抢收抢种，预计秋收前仅桂林专区可收早熟作物二百万斤。在虫灾严重地区，人民政府着重领导组织各阶层人民迅速集中力量捕灭虫害。兴安灵川灌阳等县发现虫灾后，当地人民政府即派大批干部深入农村，经普遍宣传教育，打破农民认为害虫是“神虫”、“天意”等封建迷信思想后，干部又亲自带头展开捕虫育苗运动。滨阳县组成由学生妇女参加的六个捕虫队，三天之内即捕虫三十三万只。现各地虫灾已停止蔓延，部分县区已捕灭。为了扶助重灾区人民胜利度过夏荒，省人民政府又有重点地拨发三百万斤救济粮，帮助灾民生产自救。现各地度荒运动已普遍开展，群众有充分的信心，在人民政府领导下战胜各种夏灾。
