　　Underground Hospitals in the War of Resistance Against Japan
　　Liu Rentao
    After visiting the army health service hall of the National Health Exhibition, I seemed to relive the magnificent epic of the Chinese People's Liberation War. From here, we saw the history of the military and civilians in North China behind enemy lines and the medical workers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, displaying great wisdom and fighting heroically against the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan.
    Our guide during the visit was Comrade Zhu Ting, who had participated in the 25,000-Li Long March and later engaged in the struggle against the enemy behind enemy lines in North China. Under his vivid and detailed explanation and description, we felt as if we were really in an underground hospital.
    From May 1, 1941, the Japanese invaders launched a brutal "Great Mopping-up Campaign" against the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, massacring the Chinese people on a large scale. The military and civilians in the border region created the underground tunnel warfare tactic in the anti-"mopping-up" campaign. In order to treat and rescue the wounded in the battle areas, medical workers also established underground hospitals.
    The exhibition displays a model of an underground hospital in a rural area of the Tianjin-Beijing-Baoding triangle. On the roof of a flat-topped house made of reeds, a farmer wearing a headscarf sits and looks into the distance. Under the house is the kitchen, and a peasant woman is feeding her child next to the stove. Lifting the iron pot, the bottom of the stove is the entrance to the underground hospital. Those who enter must first put their feet in and crawl down the curved tunnel. At a depth of about five feet underground, there is a "choke point" (Note 1). Passing through the "choke point" is a horizontal tunnel. In the horizontal tunnel, there is a trap. Climbing over the wooden planks set over the trap and passing through the "upper turning point" (Note 2), the tunnel turns upwards and leads into a large cave that can accommodate seven or eight people. Oil lamps are lit on the cave walls, and three cadres are holding a meeting. The guide told us: the cave is higher than the tunnel to prevent poison gas; because poison gas is heavier than air, it will sink into the trap after entering. Returning from the meeting room and walking to a "lower turning point", and proceeding forward, we reached an opening. Taking a closer look, there is water below and the sky above, and the opening is on the well wall. An old woman is floating a bucket on the water surface. There is also an opening on the opposite well wall, and a hand stretches out from inside to throw some documents into the wooden bucket; the bucket rises. The guide told us: this is one of the methods of transporting intelligence and food for the wounded. Passing over the temporary wooden plank bridge over the well water and walking to the opposite tunnel, continuing forward, we encountered "choke points" and "turning points" of different shapes, and successively visited the ward, operating room, toilet, warehouse, pharmacy, and air conditioning room (Note 3), etc. On the road, we also saw a nurse using a small cart to transport wounded comrades from the operating room to the ward. Crawling up towards the ground along the curved and narrow tunnel, suddenly our head hit a stone. Moving the stone away, we crawled out of the opening. This stone was originally a stone table in front of a grave. Covering the opening with the stone table again, there is no trace of it from the outside.
    This kind of interlocking tunnel with caves within caves and complete equipment can accommodate more than a thousand people at most. Its shape varies according to the terrain and situation, including plug-in caves, terraced caves, vegetable cellar caves, reed ditch caves, etc. In these underground hospitals, our medical workers, relying on the cover of the local peasants, were treating the wounded right beside the enemy. There were often situations like this: while the enemy was drinking and making merry in the house, our medical workers were calmly treating the wounded in the underground cave below.
    I interviewed Comrade Liao Mingliang, a veteran medical cadre who participated in the Long March and former Director of the Health Department of the Eighth Sub-district of the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. In March 1943, he was ordered to go to central Hebei to be in charge of the underground pharmaceutical group. He dug nineteen large and small interlocking caves in Dazongjiazhuang, Raoyang County, Hebei Province, and arranged various pharmaceutical production sites. The main exit of the tunnel was in the home of a widow, Grandma Wei. Grandma Wei risked her life to assist us in our underground pharmaceutical work. These underground pharmaceutical rooms were located in the midst of the enemy's encirclement. Although the enemy came to the village to search more than twenty times, the underground pharmaceutical rooms were never discovered by the enemy due to the cover of the local peasants.
    However, a tragedy occurred during that time, which we will never forget: the peasants of Yechangshigou Village, Wanxian County, because they refused to tell the enemy the hiding places of the wounded and sick soldiers of the Eighth Route Army, the entire village, men, women, old and young, more than one hundred and fifty people, were collectively slaughtered by the Japanese invaders with bayonets and machine guns. But the underground hospital was never discovered. This great spirit of heroic sacrifice is the immortal glory of the Chinese nation!
    Now, the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people has basically achieved victory. Recalling the heroic deeds of struggling hard and overcoming all difficulties at that time, we have more confidence to consolidate the fruits of our victory and to defend world peace!
    (Note 1) Choke Point - The narrow part of the tunnel: the opening only allows one person to crawl through, and the inside is wider, allowing two people. The choke point is also equipped with a wooden hatch, which can be opened and closed freely. The outside of the door is covered with a thick layer of mud. When the door is closed, the tunnel seems to be a dead end, and it can also defend against poison gas and water and fire attacks.
    (Note 2) Turning Point - Similar to the "choke point", the equipment and function are also the same. However, after passing through this opening, the tunnel deforms, either up and down, or left and right. Hence the names "upper turning point" and "lower turning point".
    (Note 3) Air Conditioning Room - This room is connected to all the cave rooms, and uses old-fashioned folk bellows to exhaust air to the ground. To supplement the inadequacy of all "air vents" in the tunnel and various cave rooms, and can also dispel the poison gas released by the enemy.

　　抗日战争中的地道医院
　　刘任涛
    参观了全国卫生展览会的军队卫生勤务馆，我好象重温了中国人民解放战争壮烈的史诗。从这里我们看到了抗日战争时期华北敌后军民和医务工作者在中国共产党领导下发挥了高度的智慧、和敌人英勇斗争的史迹。
    我们参观时的向导是曾经参加过二万五千里长征、后来在华北敌后进行对敌斗争的朱挺同志。在他生动而详尽的讲解和描述下，我们就好象真是到了地道医院一样。
    从一九四一年“五一”起，日寇向晋察冀边区进行了残酷的“大扫荡”，大举屠杀中国人民。边区军民在反“扫荡”中创造了地道战术。医务工作者为了在战斗地区医救伤员，也建立了地道医院。
    展览会中陈列的是平津保三角地带农村中一个地道医院的模型。在一间用苇子盖成的平顶房顶上，一位扎着头巾的农民坐着向远方了望。屋下是厨房，一个农妇在灶旁喂孩子吃奶。揭起铁锅，灶底就是地道医院的入口。进去的人要先将两脚放进去，顺着弯曲的洞身爬下去。在地下五尺左右的深处，有一个“卡口”（注一）。通过“卡口”，是横行的隧道。在横行的隧道里，有一个陷阱。从陷阱上所架的木板上爬过去，通过了“上翻口”（注二），隧道便转向上方，通进一个可容七八人的大洞。洞壁上点着油灯，有三个干部在开会。向导同志告诉我们：大洞高过隧道，可以防毒气；因为毒气比空气重，进来后就会沉到陷阱里。从会议室再回来，走到一个“下翻口”处，向前进行，就到达一个洞口。走近一看，下面是水，上面是天，洞口就在井壁上。一位老大娘，正把吊桶浮在水面上。对面井壁上也有一个洞口，里面伸出一只手来，将一些文件投在木桶里；水桶就上升了。向导告诉我们：这是输送情报和伤员饮食的方法之一。通过井水上面临时搭成的木板桥，走到对面的隧道，继续前进，我们又碰到形态不同的“卡口”和“翻口”，先后参观了病室、手术间、厕所、仓库、药房和空气调节室（注三）等。路上还见到一位看护员，用一辆小车从手术间送伤员同志到病室去。顺着弯曲的狭小洞身，向地面爬升，忽然头顶碰到了石块。移开石块，就爬出了洞口。这石块原来是坟前的石桌。将石桌再盖住洞口，外边就看不出丝毫痕迹。
    这种洞里套洞、设备完善的连环地洞，最大的可以容纳一千余人。其形状则随地形和情况而变更，有插板洞、梯田洞、菜窖洞、苇沟洞……之别。在这些地道医院里，我们的医务工作者，依靠着当地农民的掩护，就在敌人的身侧进行着治疗伤员的工作。常常有这种情形：当敌人正在屋里喝酒作乐时，下面的地洞里，我们的医务工作者却正在从容地替伤员治疗着。
    我访问了长征老医务干部、曾任原晋察冀边区八分区卫生处长的廖明亮同志。他在一九四三年三月间奉命到冀中负责地道制药小组工作。他在河北饶阳县大宗驾庄掘了大小十九个连环地洞，布置了各种制药场所。地道的主要出口是在一位寡妇魏大娘的家中。魏大娘冒着生命危险，协助我们进行地下制药工作。这些地道药室正处在敌人的重重包围中。但敌人虽然先后来庄上搜查二十多次，由于当地农民的掩护，地道药室终未被敌人发现过。
    但其间曾发生了一件惨案，那是我们永远也忘不了的：完县野场石沟村的农民们，为了不肯向敌人讲出八路军伤病员们的隐藏地点，全村男女老小一百五十多人被日寇用刺刀和机枪集体屠杀了。而地道医院却终于未被发现。这种伟大的英勇牺牲精神，正是中华民族不朽的光华！
    现在，中国人民的革命斗争基本上已得到了胜利。回忆起当时那种艰苦奋斗克服万难的英勇事迹，我们更有信心来巩固我们胜利的成果，来保卫世界和平！
    （注一）卡口——隧道狭窄处：口外仅容一人爬行，向内面较宽大，可容二人。卡口并设有木制活门，可自由开闭。门外涂以厚层泥土。门关时地道即似绝路，又可防御毒气及水火进攻。
    （注二）翻口——与“卡口”相似，设备及作用亦同。惟通过此口后隧道即变形，或上下、或左右。故有上翻口、下翻口之称。
    （注三）空气调节室——此室与各洞室相通，利用民间旧式风箱向地面排气。以补隧道与各洞室所有“气眼”之不足，并可驱散敌人所放毒气。
