Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The United States is intensifying its pressure on various countries, forcing them to send armies to Korea. After lengthy bargaining, in addition to the previously reported countries such as Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Nicaragua, and Turkey, which agreed to send several thousand troops each, Canadian Prime Minister Laurent announced on the evening of the 7th that the Canadian government had decided to recruit approximately five thousand soldiers to go to Korea. Philippine President Quirino also announced on the same day that the Philippines had decided to organize a so-called "expeditionary force" of one regiment to go to Korea. Quirino's decision was announced after he and the senior U.S. military advisor to the Philippines, Hops, met on the same day; before this meeting, Quirino had repeatedly complained to his American master about his internal "difficulties," requesting to be exempted from his "obligation" to send troops.

Although French Premier Pleven has repeatedly stated in his declarations that France is unable to provide financial or personnel support to the United States, U.S. authorities recently in Paris again "demanded" that the French government immediately send troops to Korea. Nevertheless, according to Agence France-Presse on the 3rd: "The French government still believes that the efforts made in Indochina do not allow France to divert even the smallest part of its forces." Besides France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Brazil, Cuba, Colombia, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Lebanon, etc., which have clearly refused the U.S. order to send troops, the Saudi Arabian government announced on the 4th that the country "cannot provide military aid to Korea." The Syrian government also sent a similar notification to Lie on the 3rd. Liberia and Israel also notified Lie on the 3rd that they could not send troops; Israel was only willing to provide medical assistance. Liberian Foreign Minister Dennis said in a notification to Lie that the country was willing to contribute natural rubber worth ten thousand U.S. dollars to the United Nations. South African Defense Minister Erasmus said on the 5th that South Africa was unable to send troops, but could only provide ten aircraft and two hundred ground crew and pilots as a "symbolic force." An Indonesian official spokesperson announced on the 2nd: "According to current foreign policy, the government cannot allow Indonesians to join armies under foreign flags."

Under circumstances where the war situation has been consistently unfavorable to the American aggressors, the governments of countries that have promised to send troops are still delaying the actual time of their troop deployment, observing the situation. When announcing the decision to send troops to Korea, the Canadian Prime Minister said that this plan still needed to be "approved by Congress." Quirino said: "The troops to be sent still need fourteen weeks of training." Australian Prime Minister Menzies said on the 3rd that Australian "volunteers will be trained in Japan together with the Australian occupation forces in Japan before departing for combat in Korea." Therefore, nearly a month after the United States used Lie to make a "request," not a single soldier from any other country's army has been at the disposal of the United States in Korea.

In order to compel countries to obey the U.S. orders, the U.S. Senate passed on July 31st an "amendment" attached to the third year appropriations bill of the "Marshall Plan," "authorizing Truman to reduce the Marshall Plan appropriations to those countries that he believes are not fully supporting the United Nations 'police action' in Korea."

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: A Dentsu News Agency reporter reported from Washington that the U.S. State Department has instructed its diplomatic representatives in several Latin American countries to begin negotiations with their governments regarding the supply of troops for combat in Korea.

The American imperialists have stipulated the approximate number of soldiers that each Latin American country must supply to the American intervention in Korea. According to the plan, Argentina must send at least three thousand soldiers to Korea, Brazil eight thousand, Colombia one thousand five hundred, and Chile one thousand.

### 美国加紧胁迫各国派陆军至朝鲜  加菲两国政府将出兵帮凶  法荷比等国明白表示拒绝

　　美国加紧胁迫各国派陆军至朝鲜
    加菲两国政府将出兵帮凶
    法荷比等国明白表示拒绝
    【新华社十一日讯】美国正在加紧向各国施用压力，迫其派遣陆军至朝鲜。在经过长时间的讨价还价以后，除了前已报道的英、澳、新西兰、泰国、尼加拉瓜、土尔其等国，同意各派出数千陆军外，加拿大总理劳伦特于七日晚宣布：加拿大政府已决定招募陆军约五千名赴朝鲜。菲律宾总统季里诺亦于同日宣布，菲律宾决定组织所谓“远征军”一个团赴朝鲜。季里诺此项决定，是在同日他和美国驻菲高级军事顾问霍普斯会谈之后宣布的；在此次会谈之前，季里诺曾一再向其美国主子申诉其内部“困难”，要求免除其出兵“义务”。
    法国总理普利文虽屡次在声明中表示法国无法提供财力、人员等以支援美国，但美国当局最近仍在巴黎再次“要求”法国政府立即出兵赴朝鲜。虽然如此，据法新社三日讯：“法国政府仍认为：在印度支那所作的努力，不容许法国分散其甚至最小一部分的兵力”。除了法、荷、比、丹、挪、巴西、古巴、哥伦比亚、印度、巴基斯坦、阿富汗、伊朗、黎巴嫩等已明白表示拒绝美国要求出兵的命令外，沙特阿拉伯政府已于四日宣称该国“不能在军事上援助朝鲜”，叙利亚政府亦曾于三日以同样的通知送达赖伊；利比里亚和以色列也于三日通知赖伊说：它们不能出兵；以色列仅愿提供医药援助；利比里亚外长丹尼斯则在给赖伊的通知中说：该国愿以价值一万美元的天然橡胶贡献给联合国。南非国防部长伊拉斯马五日表示南非无力派出陆军，仅能提供十架飞机和二百名地勤人员和飞行员作为“象征军队”。印尼官方发言人则于二日宣称：“根据现在的外交政策，政府不能准许印尼人参加外国旗帜下的军队。”

    在战局一直不利于美国侵略者的情况下，已答应出兵的各国政府，仍在拖延其实际出兵的时间，以观风色。加总理在宣布决定派兵赴朝鲜时称：此计划尚须“由国会批准”；季里诺说：“将派出的军队尚需经十四个星期的训练。”澳总理孟席斯三日说：澳“志愿兵在启程赴朝鲜作战之前，将与澳驻日占领军一同在日本受训”。因此，在美国利用赖伊提出“要求”将近一个月的今天，尚无任何别国的陆军的一兵一卒在朝鲜供美国驱使。
    为了压迫各国听从美国的命令，美参院已于七月三十一日通过一项附加在“马歇尔计划”第三年度拨款法案上的“修正案”，“授权杜鲁门对那些他认为不尽力支持联合国在朝鲜的‘警察行动’的国家，得削减其马歇尔计划拨款”。
              （美国新闻处）
    【新华社十一日讯】电通社记者自华盛顿报道称，美国国务院已训令它驻在若干拉丁美洲国家的外交代表与各国政府就供应军队赴朝鲜作战一节开始谈判。
    美国帝国主义者规定了每一拉丁美洲国家须供应美国干涉朝鲜的士兵的大概数目。根据计划，阿根廷至少要派往朝鲜三千名士兵，巴西八千名，哥伦比亚一千五百名，智利一千名。
