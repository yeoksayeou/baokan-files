Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 8th: Northeast People's Government Chairman Gao Gang gave important instructions on the future work of trade unions in Northeast China at the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions held in late July. The main purpose of this meeting was to discuss the work outline for the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions in the second half of the year. In his speech, Chairman Gao Gang first pointed out that the historical environment of trade union work in Northeast China has three main characteristics: First, it is under the leadership of the working class and its vanguard Communist Party, and the vast majority of workers work in state-owned enterprises; this is fundamentally different from the trade union work during the rule of the Kuomintang and Japanese imperialism. Second, trade union work is in a period of large-scale economic construction, which is also different from trade union work in the base areas during the war. Third, the development of the working class is very rapid, with more than 200,000 new workers added in the first half of this year alone. The basic task of trade unions in this historical environment is to thoroughly implement the Trade Union Law promulgated by the Central People's Government; to organize and educate workers and do a good job in production work based on the Trade Union Law and the current specific environment in Northeast China. Trade union workers in state-owned enterprises must first go deep into the production process, rather than stand outside of production. Second, they must learn technology, study their business, and gradually become experts. Third, they must specifically assist factory and mine administrations in doing a good job in production work. After emphasizing the importance of uniting the entire working class, Chairman Gao Gang pointed out that trade unions should pay attention to uniting technicians and staff, educating workers to learn technology and respect the guidance of technicians and management personnel; and making workers understand that labor must be combined with science in order to rapidly advance the cause of construction.

Regarding the relationship between trade unions, the CCP committees, and the administration in state-owned enterprises, Chairman Gao Gang clearly pointed out that their relationship should be one of close unity, mutual support, and cooperation to do a good job in production. Trade unions should take the initiative to help the administration solve difficulties. The administration's plans should be discussed among the workers, and all work to mobilize the masses of workers must be done through the trade unions. The trade union is a bridge between the Communist Party and the masses of workers, and the Party must be good at carrying out its work through the trade union. It is wrong for the Party committee to adopt the method of monopolizing or ignoring trade union work.

At the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee, Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, reported on the work outline of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions for the second half of this year. The main goal is to overcome the phenomena of low product quality, high costs, and many defective products in production. The main contents of the outline are four points: First, improve production technology, unite technicians and staff. Second, consolidate labor enthusiasm and strengthen labor discipline. Third, improve factory and mine hygiene, labor protection and wage systems, and prevent worker turnover. Fourth, further coordinate labor-management relations.

　　东北总工会执委扩大会议上
    高岗指示工会工作任务
    张维桢报告下半年工作大纲
    【新华社沈阳八日电】东北人民政府高岗主席，曾在七月下旬召开的东北总工会执行委员扩大会议上，对今后东北工会工作作了重要指示。这次会议主要是讨论下半年东北工会工作大纲。高岗主席在讲话中首先指出东北工会工作的历史环境有三个主要特点：第一是在工人阶级及其先锋队共产党领导的政权之下，而且绝大多数工人是在公营企业里工作；这和过去国民党以及日本帝国主义统治时期的工会工作，有着原则的区别。第二是处在大规模经济建设时期的工会工作，与过去战争时期根据地内的工会工作亦有所不同。第三，工人阶级队伍的发展非常迅速，仅今年上半年就增加了新工人二十余万。工会在这种历史环境下的基本任务，就要彻底执行中央人民政府颁布的工会法；根据工会法和东北当前的具体环境，去组织和教育工人，作好生产工作。在公营企业的工会工作人员，首先要深入到生产过程中去，而不是站在生产之外。其次，要学习技术，钻研业务，逐渐使自己成为内行。再次，要具体地协助厂矿行政共同作好生产工作。高岗主席在强调团结全体工人阶级的重要性之后指出，目前工会要注意团结技术人员与职员，教育工人学习技术并尊重技术人员与管理人员的指导；要使工人懂得劳动必须与科学结合，才能把建设事业迅速推向前进。
    关于公营企业中工会与中共党委和行政的关系问题，高岗主席明确指出：他们之间的关系应该是亲密团结，互相支援配合，把生产工作做好。工会要主动帮助行政解决困难。行政的计划，应该在工人中讨论，一切动员工人群众的工作都要经过工会去做。工会是共产党与工人群众联系的桥梁，党要善于通过工会进行工作。党委对于工会工作采取包办代替或不管的办法都是错误的。
    在执委扩大会上，东北总工会主席张维桢报告了东北总工会今年下半年的工作大纲。其主要目标是克服生产中产品质量低、成本高和废品多的现象。该大纲主要内容有四点：第一是提高生产技术，团结技术人员与职员。第二是巩固劳动热情，加强劳动纪律。第三是改善工厂矿山卫生、劳动保护与工资制度，防止工人流动。第四是进一步协调劳资关系。
