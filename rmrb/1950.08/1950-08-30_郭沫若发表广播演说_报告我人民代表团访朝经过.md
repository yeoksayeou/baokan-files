　　Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation that represented the Chinese people in Korea to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15" and to慰劳 the Korean people and the Korean People's Army fighting against American imperialist aggression, delivered a radio address at the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing today. The full text of the speech is as follows:
    The Chinese People's Delegation, representing the Chinese people, went to Korea to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the "August 15" liberation of Korea and to express sympathy to the Korean people and the Korean People's Army who are fighting against American imperialist aggression. We departed from Beijing on the evening of the 11th and arrived in Pyongyang on the evening of the 14th. The next day, we participated in the "August 15" celebration and conveyed the sincere congratulations of the Chinese people. Afterwards, we split into groups to visit Seoul, Wonsan, and other places to offer our sympathy. We stayed in Korea for a total of eight days and received warm hospitality from the Korean government and people, who provided us with every convenience to complete our mission. We arrived safely back in Beijing on the evening of the 24th. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Korean government and the Korean people.
    This trip to Korea was very rewarding. All kinds of information and records of our observations are being sorted out, and a more detailed written report will be published soon to inform our compatriots in China and all peace-loving and just people in the world. During the visit, the facts that impressed us most were two: one was the unanimous patriotic performance of the Korean people, and the other was the inhuman and brutal atrocities of the American aggressor troops.
    In the just war against American imperialist aggression and defending national independence, the Korean people have already achieved a nationwide mobilization. The total number of people joining the army has reached 1.2 million. Workers, farmers, youth, women, all parties, and all classes, under the call of General Kim Il-sung, "Everything for the Front," demonstrate great organization, discipline, and unparalleled heroic spirit. This is entirely the reason why the Korean people can achieve brilliant victories in the war.
    In contrast to the heroic Korean people, the American aggressor troops are cowardly and brutal. American military aircraft indiscriminately bomb and strafe peaceful cities and villages in the rear, and hospitals, schools, churches, and residential houses are mostly destroyed. Many women, children, and the elderly are injured or killed. The bestial atrocities of the American aggressor troops are indeed worse than those of the Japanese imperialists in the past. For this reason, our delegation has sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council to accuse them, demanding that the American imperialists' atrocities be stopped and that the American aggressor troops be ordered to withdraw from Korea immediately.
    The heroism of the Korean people is worthy of our praise and learning, and the brutality of the American aggressor troops arouses our hatred and vigilance. In the just war against aggression, the Korean people are not only fighting to defend the independence of their own country, but also to defend world peace. The victory of the Korean people is a great contribution to world peace. We Chinese people must unite as one and do our best to support the just war of the Korean people; and we must, with the same heroism, liberate Taiwan and drive the invading beastly troops of American imperialism out of our territory.
    Through our personal experience, we firmly believe that the final victory will surely belong to the Korean people; and we also firmly believe that as long as all the Chinese people and all the oppressed nations of Asia can be as united and bravely fighting as the Korean people, American imperialism will inevitably suffer a more tragic defeat than Japanese imperialism.
    We wholeheartedly wish the Korean people an early final victory.
    We wholeheartedly wish good health to General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people.

　　郭沫若发表广播演说
    报告我人民代表团访朝经过
    赞扬朝鲜人民高涨的爱国热情和无比的英勇气概
    号召支援朝鲜人民并把美国侵略者逐出我国领土
    【新华社二十九日讯】曾代表中国人民前往朝鲜参加朝鲜解放五周年庆典的中国人民代表团团长郭沫若本日在北京中央人民广播电台发表演说。演说词全文如下：
    中国人民代表团代表中国人民赴朝鲜庆贺“八、一五”朝鲜解放五周年纪念，并慰劳反美帝侵略的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，于十一日晚由北京出发，十四日晚到达平壤。翌日参加“八、一五”庆祝大会，传达了中国人民诚恳的贺意。继复分组赴汉城、元山等地慰问。计在朝鲜境内滞留凡八日，备受朝鲜政府及人民热诚招待，并惠予一切便宜，俾得完成任务，业于二十四日晚安抵北京。谨对朝鲜政府及朝鲜人民表示深厚的谢意。
    此次本团赴朝，收获甚多。所有各种资料及见闻纪录，正从事整理，不日将发表一比较详细的书面报告奉告全中国的同胞及全世界爱好和平正义的善良人民。在访问中，最使我们注意的事实有二：一为朝鲜人民举国一致的爱国表现，二为美国侵略军惨无人道的残暴兽行。
    朝鲜人民在反对美帝侵略、保卫祖国独立的正义战争中业已做到全国总动员，全国参军人数已达一百二十万人，工人、农民、青年、妇女，全国各党派各阶层，在金日成将军的“一切为了前线”的号召之下，表示着极大的组织性、纪律性和无比的英勇气概。朝鲜人民在战争中能获得辉煌的胜利，其原因毕在于此。
    和朝鲜人民的英勇成对比的，是美国侵略军的卑怯和残暴。美军飞机对后方和平城市及乡村滥施轰炸和扫射，医院、学校、教堂及居民住宅多被炸毁，妇孺老弱伤亡甚众，美国侵略军的兽性暴行比往年日本帝国主义者实有过之而无不及。为此，本团曾致电联合国安全理事会控诉，要求制止美帝兽行，并令美国侵略军立即退出朝鲜。
    朝鲜人民的英勇是值得我们歌颂和学习的，美国侵略军的兽行是引起我们痛恨和警惕的。朝鲜人民在反侵略的正义战争中，不仅在为保卫自己祖国独立而战，并在为保卫世界持久和平而战。朝鲜人民的胜利对于世界和平有莫大的贡献。我们中国人民必须团结一致，尽力支援朝鲜人民的正义战争；并必须以同样的英勇，解放台湾，把美帝国主义的侵略兽军逐出我国的领土。
    我们经过亲身的体验，坚决地相信，最后的胜利必然属于朝鲜人民；并同样坚决地相信，只要我们全中国人民和全亚细亚被压迫民族能够像朝鲜人民的举国一致、英勇奋斗一样，美帝国主义必然遭受到比日本帝国主义更悲惨的失败。
    我们全心全意地祝朝鲜人民早日获得最后胜利。
    我们全心全意地祝朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军的健康。
