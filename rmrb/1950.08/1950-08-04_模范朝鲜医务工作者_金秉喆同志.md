Model Korean Medical Worker
Comrade Kim Byung-cheol

Korean comrade Kim Byung-cheol is a surgeon at the Jinzhou Railway Hospital in Northeast China. He joined the hospital in 1949 and was elected as a first-class labor model of the Jinzhou Bureau in less than a year.

Comrade Kim Byung-cheol has a high degree of internationalist spirit. Shortly after joining the hospital, he felt very unhappy because he saw that the doctors were too conservative and unwilling to easily allow general doctors and nurses to participate in operations. Therefore, he first made his own techniques public. Not only did he allow general doctors and nurses to participate in on-site learning during each operation, but he also explained the pathology and surgical methods to everyone before and after the operation. After a considerable period of time, he would selectively involve them in practical work based on their learning progress. In just half a year from June to December last year, four nurses were able to perform operations such as appendicitis, hemorrhoids, limb separation, hernia, and complex small bone sutures.

Dr. Kim not only trained several nurses himself, but also led the entire hospital to launch a wave of apprenticeship, which promoted trainees Wang Jieyan, Zhong Cuixia, and Yu Suqin to intern nurses. Several intern nurses were also able to do the work of nurses.

Last autumn, Dr. Kim broke and dislocated his left leg. At that time, the injury was very serious and it was no longer possible to participate in work, but he still cared about the injured workers during the treatment period. If there was an emergency operation, he would insist on doing it himself. While ill, he performed operations for Zhang Zongyao of the Inspection Section, Zhu Xiulan of the Auditing Section, Zhang Guozhong, Li Kuiming, Li Fengxing, and Yu Yaozhong of the Engineering Team, enabling them to regain their health. Wang Licheng of the Jinzhou Station Supply Cooperative had a fracture of his left upper arm, and there would be a danger to his life if the operation was delayed. After hearing this news, Kim Byung-cheol ignored the pain in his leg, went to the operating room on crutches, and performed the operation for him, finally helping the patient out of danger and gradually recover.

During his recuperation, in order to facilitate the treatment of seriously ill patients, he voluntarily requested that seriously injured patients be concentrated in the ward where he lived for treatment. He not only personally diagnosed and treated the patients, but also personally took care of them. Because the work was too heavy, his leg injury turned into severe arthritis. The hospital repeatedly advised him to rest, but he forgot his own illness and still insisted on performing emergency operations.

Once, the Zhengjiatun branch hospital called the Jintie Hospital, saying that a lying-in woman urgently needed an operation, but the branch hospital could not do it by itself and needed the Jinzhou Hospital to send a doctor. Dr. Kim Byung-cheol, who was still in recuperation, took the surgical equipment to Zhengjiatun. At that time, there was no ticket car, so he tried to take a freight car to ensure the patient's life safety. Another time, Li Qu, a family member of a worker in the locomotive section, came to the hospital for treatment. The general obstetricians could not determine what the disease was. After hearing this, he automatically went to the obstetrics department to participate in the diagnosis and proved that it was a hydatidiform mole. With his help, an operation was performed, once again ensuring the patient's safety.

### 模范朝鲜医务工作者  金秉喆同志

　　模范朝鲜医务工作者
    金秉喆同志
    朝鲜同志金秉喆，是东北锦州铁路医院的外科大夫，一九四九年入院工作，不到一年，就当选了锦州局的一等劳动模范。
    金秉喆大夫具有高度的国际主义精神。他入院后不久，因为看见大夫们太保守，动手术时不愿轻意让一般医生及护士们参加，便感到很不愉快。于是他就先把自己技术公开出来，不但每次动手术时都让一般医生和护士参加实地学习，动手术前后还给大家说明病理和手术的作法。这样经过相当时期后，他就根据各人的学习进步情况，有重点地叫他们参加实际工作。只从去年六月到十二月的半年时间中，就有四个护士，能作阑尾炎、痔核、离肢、贺尔尼亚、复杂的小骨缝合等手术。
    金大夫不只自己培养了好几个护士，也带动了全院大夫展开带徒弟的热潮，在这个热潮中，使练习生王洁岩、钟翠霞、于素琴提高为见习护士，几个见习护士也都能作护士的工作了。
    去年秋天金大夫左腿摔断脱臼。当时伤势很重，已经不可能参加工作，但他在治疗期间仍然关心着伤病工友，遇有紧急手术，一定坚持自己去作。病中，他为检车段的张宗耀、审计科的朱秀兰、工程队的张国忠、李奎明、李凤兴、于耀忠等人动了手术，使他们都恢复了健康。锦州站供应社王立成左上膊骨折断了，晚一点动手术就有生命的危险。金秉喆听到这个消息后，就不顾腿痛，拄着拐杖到了手术室，给他施行了手术，终于使患者脱离危险，渐渐康复起来。
    他在养伤期间，为了便于给重患者治病，自动要求把重伤患者都集中到他住的病房里治疗。他不但亲自给患者诊治，而且还亲自加以看护，因为工作太重，以致使他的腿伤转为严重的关节炎。院方曾数次劝他休息，可是他忘了自己的病，仍然坚持着去动紧急手术。
    有一次，郑家屯分院给锦铁医院来电话，说有一位产妇急待动手术，分院自己作不了，须要锦州院派大夫去。仍在休养期间的金秉喆大夫就带了手术用具去郑家屯。当时没有票车，他就设法搭货车前往，保证了患者的生命安全。另一次，机务段工友家属产妇李曲氏到院要求治疗，产科一般大夫都不能确定是什么病，他听到后就自动去产科参加诊断，证明是葡萄胎。在他的帮助下动了手术，又一次保证了患者的安全。
