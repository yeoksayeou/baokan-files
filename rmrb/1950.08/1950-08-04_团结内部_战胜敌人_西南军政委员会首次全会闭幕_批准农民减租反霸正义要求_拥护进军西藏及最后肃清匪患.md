Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 3rd: The first plenary session of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, lasting five days, successfully concluded on July 31st. The meeting fully agreed with Chairman Liu Bocheng's report on "The Tasks of the Southwest Region" and resolved to adopt this report as the working guideline for the Southwest Region. The meeting called on all levels of people's governments in the Southwest Region to lead all the people in striving for the complete realization of this working guideline.

The meeting also passed the four reports made to the conference by Committee Members Zhang Jichun, Zhou Shidi, Liu Daifeng, and Chu Tunan, respectively, on rent reduction, military affairs, finance and economics, and culture and education.

Regarding the current central tasks of the Southwest Region—suppressing bandits, reducing rent, and opposing landlords—the meeting held group and plenary discussions. All committee members unanimously agreed that these are major issues concerning the lives of 40 to 50 million poor peasants in the Southwest. Since the liberation of the Southwest half a year ago, the broad masses of rural people who have long suffered from feudal exploitation have generally raised demands for rent reduction and opposition to landlords. The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee should fully approve these just demands of the peasants. The meeting, based on reliable materials, proved that the oppression and exploitation of peasants by the landlord feudal forces in various parts of the Southwest were extremely cruel and barbaric. Peasants not only had to pay heavy rents to landlords every year, but also had to pay landlords a "deposit" equivalent to about one-third or even more of the land price before renting the land. This deposit was even higher than the annual rent paid to the landlords. Peasants borrowed this deposit at high interest rates to rent land; while landlords gradually used various cunning and coercive means to annex it. In Sichuan alone, 20 to 30 percent of peasants were reduced to abject poverty as a result.

Regarding military issues, the meeting actively supported the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet and endorsed all the policies toward Tibet announced by Chairman Liu in his report on "The Tasks of the Southwest Region." Regarding the suppression of bandits, the meeting expressed its heartfelt gratitude to the troops of the Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army for annihilating large groups of bandits within a few months and sent a telegram to the bandit suppression troops to express its congratulations. The meeting resolved that joint suppression operations should be launched swiftly in the border areas of provinces and regions in order to finally eliminate banditry, consolidate revolutionary order, and strengthen the national defense of the Southwest.

Regarding the issues of ethnic minorities in the Southwest, the meeting had a common understanding: that only by first eliminating Han chauvinism can we influence ethnic minorities to gradually eliminate the narrow nationalism caused by long-term oppression by Han chauvinism. When implementing ethnic regional autonomy in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, the people's government must do its best to help in terms of economy, culture, education, and medical and health care. Any social reforms in ethnic minority areas must be particularly cautious and take the method of consultation with the people of all ethnic groups and their leaders to implement the ethnic policy of equality, friendship, mutual assistance, and unity.

Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping made a concluding speech on the last day of the meeting, elaborating in detail on five issues: unity internally and defeating the enemy, opposing landlords and reducing rent, cadres, ethnic minorities, and opposing bureaucracy. He said that the basic spirit of this meeting is to unite internally and defeat the enemy.

The meeting unanimously endorsed Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping's speech and resolved to use it as the summary report of the meeting.

The meeting unanimously passed a salute to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Premier Zhou, and sent a telegram to compatriots across the country opposing the atrocities of American imperialism in invading Taiwan and Korea.

The meeting was brought to a close by Vice Chairman Xiong Kewu, who called on all committee members attending the meeting to conscientiously implement Chairman Liu Bocheng's report and the resolutions of the meeting in their actual work.

　　团结内部·战胜敌人
    西南军政委员会首次全会闭幕
    批准农民减租反霸正义要求
    拥护进军西藏及最后肃清匪患
    【新华社重庆三日电】西南军政委员会第一次全体委员会议，历时五日，已于七月三十一日胜利闭幕。会议完全同意刘伯承主席关于“西南区的工作任务”的报告，并决议将这个报告作为西南区的工作方针。会议号召西南区各级人民政府，领导全体人民，为这个工作方针的彻底实现而努力。
    会议同时通过了张际春、周士第、刘岱峰、楚图南四委员分别向大会所作的减租、军事、财经、文教的四项报告。
    对于西南区当前的中心工作——剿匪、减租、反霸等问题，会议进行了小组和大会讨论。全体委员一致认为：这是关系西南四五千万贫苦农民生活的重大问题。西南解放半年以来，长期遭受封建剥削的广大农村人民，业已普遍提出减租和反霸等要求。西南军政委员会应当完全批准农民这些正义的要求。会议根据可靠材料证明：西南各地地主封建势力对农民的压迫和剥削是极其残酷和野蛮的。农民不仅每年要向地主缴纳苛重的地租，并且在租种土地之前，首先要向地主交出约相当于地价三分之一甚至更多的“押金”。这种押金，比每年交给地主的地租还多。农民以高利贷借得此项押金，租种土地；而地主却逐步用各种巧取豪夺的方式，实行吞并。仅四川即有百分之二十至三十的农民因此沦为赤贫。
    关于军事问题，会议积极拥护人民解放军向西藏进军，并赞同刘主席在“西南区的工作任务”报告中所宣布的对西藏的全部政策。关于剿匪问题，会议对人民解放军西南军区部队在数月之内已将大股土匪歼灭，表示衷心的感谢，并致电剿匪部队表示祝贺。会议决议：应迅速展开省区边界的会剿，以便最后肃清匪患，巩固革命秩序及西南国防。
    关于西南少数民族问题，会议具有一个共同的认识：即只有首先清除大汉族主义，才能影响少数民族逐渐化除长期受大汉族主义压迫所引起的狭隘民族主义。在少数民族聚居地区实行民族区域自治时，人民政府必须在经济上、文化教育和医药卫生上尽力帮助。在少数民族地区进行任何社会改革，都必须特别慎重，并采取与各族人民及其领导人物协商的办法，以贯彻平等、友爱、互助、团结的民族政策。
    邓小平副主席在会议最后一日作了总结性的发言，详尽地阐述了关于团结内部、战胜敌人，反霸、减租，干部，少数民族，反对官僚主义等五个问题。他说，这次会议的基本精神，就是团结内部，战胜敌人。
    会议一致拥护邓小平副主席的发言，并决议以此作为会议的总结报告。
    会议一致通过向毛主席、朱总司令、周总理致敬，并通电全国同胞，反对美国帝国主义侵略台湾和朝鲜的暴行。
    会议由熊克武副主席致闭幕词，他号召出席此次会议的全体委员，应把刘伯承主席的报告和会议的决议，认真地贯彻到实际工作中去。
