　　After Implementing Rewards, Production Work in Beijing's State-Owned Factories is Further Advanced; Some Factories Still Do Not Value Reward Work; Egalitarianism and Other Deviations Still Exist in Rewards
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Lan Cun reports: In May and June of this year, the vast majority of state-owned factories in Beijing generally provided material and spiritual rewards to employees and production units with excellent production performance, inventions, creations, or reasonable suggestions. This reward system combined the workers' political consciousness with their own material interests, consolidated and developed the workers' production enthusiasm, and advanced the production work of various factories.
    The production competitions in units such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Power Plant, North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and Tram Company have been launched on a larger scale after the awards were given. The Tram Company's New Record Movement began challenging on June 25th at the awards ceremony, and significant results were achieved by July 10th. It is estimated that the plan to complete the annual production target in nine months may be achieved ahead of schedule. After the Bus Company issued awards, workers on various routes requested to sign collective contracts to reverse the company's loss-making situation. The Fourth Route bus, which signed the contract first, has approached a balance of income and expenditure. The Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, which first implemented the piecework bonus system, has consistently maintained the workers' enthusiasm for production.
  Workers have shown unprecedented concern for the people's enterprises
    From the specific actions of some workers, since the implementation of rewards, workers have shown unprecedented concern for the people's enterprises. After Tram Repair Factory veteran worker Lu Yuntai won an award, he said, "I will first buy a portrait of Chairman Mao to hang in my room, then fix two teeth and eat more, so I can work hard for the factory for a few more years." In order to ensure buses are dispatched on time, Bus Company workers often get up at three or four o'clock in the morning to start the stoves. Even workers who were relatively conservative in the past have changed their attitude after the implementation of rewards. Tram Repair Factory worker Liu Jingheng, who used to be relatively conservative, automatically took out more than 300 pieces of valuable tools and equipment accumulated by his family for generations and dedicated them to the factory. This time, the awards in various factories focused on rewarding employees' inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals. Therefore, after the awards were given, the number of inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals in various factories increased significantly in the production competition. For example, in the Bus Company, following Zhu Lin's May 1st coal-powered bus, there were also the creations of Li Dequan's and Li Dan's two types of coal stoves, which were improvements over Zhu Lin's coal-gas stove.
  The implementation of rewards has promoted the rapid establishment of various systems
    An even more important role of the implementation of rewards is that it has promoted the rapid establishment of various systems in factories. When determining reward standards and distributing bonuses, various difficulties arose due to the unsoundness of various workshop systems, prompting the leaders of various factories to pay more attention to establishing and improving various workshop systems and planning systems. For example, the reporting system and statistical work of the Tram Company Repair Factory have been greatly improved. Now the factory can summarize production results every ten days. Preparations are being made to establish quota management for product quality, quantity, working hours, and material consumption by the end of the year.
  Neglecting rewards and some deviations that have occurred in rewards
    However, at present, there are still a few factory leaders who have not recognized the role of rewards in production work. Workers who have made contributions to production do not receive the encouragement they deserve. For example, in the Beijing Machine Third Branch Factory, the head of the workshop section renovated the tool for refining the surround, which played a decisive role in improving the production of water trucks, but the factory leaders were not prepared to give a reward. Although some units also issued awards, they did not proceed from the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests, and rewarding more labor with more pay." For example, in the first quarter of this year, the workers in the Garment Factory came up with many ways to save fabric and exceed production, saving the factory more than one million catties of millet, but the administration only allocated 5,000 catties of millet as a reward. Therefore, when preparing to issue the awards, the number of winners was only determined based on the amount of the bonus, so that many people who should have won the award did not receive it.
    Some factories that have paid attention to the reward work also have some problems in their work: (1) The distribution of collective rewards generally has a tendency towards egalitarianism. For example, some groups on the tram company and bus company routes distributed bonuses equally, regardless of whether they were drivers or ticket sellers. (2) The formulation of reward regulations still lacks clear and reasonable standards. For example, the reward regulations for inventions and creations of the Shijingshan Power Plant (which were formulated by the North China Electric Power Management Bureau) do not stipulate that the bonus should account for a certain percentage of the value created, but stipulate that the bonus for inventions and creations should not exceed four months' average salary. This has aroused dissatisfaction among employees (now the Electric Power Management Bureau is preparing to make some supplementary amendments). (3) Some units are not clear enough about the view of "rewarding what is advocated." For example, when the Bus Company started rewarding, it focused on mileage on the routes, as a result, workers neglected the maintenance of the cars and the saving of fuel in order to pursue mileage, and such rewards are difficult to improve the effect of production (this situation has finally been corrected). These shortcomings are due to the fact that the reward work has just begun, but they should be studied and resolved as soon as possible in order to play a greater role in production.

### 京公营工厂实行奖励后  生产工作推进一步  仍有少数厂尚未重视奖励工作  奖励中也还有平均主义等偏向

　　京公营工厂实行奖励后
    生产工作推进一步
    仍有少数厂尚未重视奖励工作  奖励中也还有平均主义等偏向
    【本报讯】记者蓝村报道：今年五、六月份，京市绝大部分公营工厂对生产成绩优良、发明创造或提出合理建议的职工与生产单位，普遍进行了物质与精神的奖励。这一奖励，使工人的政治自觉与其个人一定的物质利益结合起来，巩固并发展了工人们的生产热情，将各工厂的生产工作推进了一步。
    石景山钢铁厂、发电厂、华北农业机械总厂、电车公司等单位的生产竞赛，在发奖以后，更大规模地开展起来。电车公司的新纪录运动，在六月二十五日的发奖大会上开始挑战，到七月十日即获得了显著成绩。估计九个月完成全年生产任务的计划，可能提前实现。公共汽车公司发奖后，各路工人纷纷要求订立集体合同，要扭转公司赔钱的局面。已签订合同的四路车，收支已接近平衡。最早实行超额奖励制的北京汽车修配厂，工人们的生产热情是一直保持了下来。
  工人们对人民的企业表现了从来没有过的关切
    从一些工人的具体行动来看，自从进行奖励以后，工人们对人民的企业表现了从来没有过的关切。电车修造厂老工人路运泰得奖后说：“我先买一张毛主席像挂在房里，然后补上两个牙，多吃点东西，要好好给工厂多干几年。”公共汽车公司工人们为了准时出车，常常早上三、四点钟就起来生炉子发火。就连过去比较保守的工人，在实行奖励以后也改变了态度。电车修造厂工人刘景恒过去比较保守，发奖后自动拿出家里世代积存下的三百余件珍贵的工具和器材献给了工厂。这次各厂的奖励，着重奖励了职工的发明创造与合理化建议。因此，发奖后，各厂的发明创造与合理化建议在生产竞赛中大量地增加起来。如公共汽车公司，继朱临的五一式煤汽车之后，又有了李德全、李丹两种石炭炉子的创造，比朱临的煤汽炉又有了改进。
  实行奖励推动了各种制度的迅速建立
    实行奖励后一个更重要的作用，是推动了工厂各种制度的迅速建立。在确定奖励标准和分配奖金时，因各种工务制度不健全，发生了种种困难，促使各工厂的领导更注意建立与健全各种工务制度与计划制度。如电车公司修造厂的表报制度与统计工作，已有很大改进。现在该厂已能做到每十天总结一次生产成绩。准备争取在年底建立起产品质量、数量、工时及用料的定额管理。
  轻视奖励以及奖励中发生过的一些偏向
    但是，目前还有少数工厂的领导干部没有认识到奖励对生产工作的作用。工人们对生产有了贡献得不到应得的鼓励。如北京机器第三分厂，工务股长改造了围炼子的工具，对提高水车的生产起着决定性的作用，该厂领导上不准备给予奖励。有些单位虽然也发了奖，但不是从“公私兼顾、多劳多得”的原则出发。如被服厂今年第一季的生产，工人们想了许多办法节省布料及超额生产，使工厂节省了一百余万斤小米，行政方面却只拨了五千斤小米作为奖励。因而在准备发奖时，只是根据奖金数目来确定得奖人数，使许多应该得奖的人得不到奖。
    已经重视了奖励工作的一些厂子，在工作中也还存在一些问题：（一）集体奖励的分配，普遍存在着平均主义的偏向。如电车公司、汽车公司车路上某些小组，不管司机与卖票工人，平均分配了奖金。（二）奖励条例的制定，还缺乏明确合理的标准。如石景山发电厂的发明创造的奖励条例（该条例为华北电业管理总局所制订），没有规定奖金应占所创造价值的一定百分比，而规定发明创造的奖金最高不能超过四个月的平均工资。这曾引起职工们的不满（现在电业管理总局已准备作某些补充修正）。（三）有的单位对“提倡什么奖励什么”的观点还不够明确。如汽车公司开始奖励时车路上以公里数为重点，结果工人因追赶公里数而忽略了车子的保养和燃料的节省，这样的奖励，很难得到提高生产的效果（此种情形最后已得到纠正）。这些缺点是由于奖励工作刚刚开始所致，但还应及早研究解决，以便对生产发挥更大的作用。
