　　The People's Daily Publishes Commentary
    Worldwide People Support the Korean People
    Angry Voices Protesting American Crimes Resound Throughout the World
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th] According to TASS, Moscow: The Labor Daily published an editorial entitled "Stop the American Aggressors," stating: The angry voices protesting the crimes of the American interventionists in Korea have resounded in all countries around the world.

    The American imperialists launched this heinous war of aggression against Korea, but they underestimated the inexhaustible strength of the freedom-loving Korean people and the strength of the People's Army, which is supported and sympathized with by the entire people.

    After entering the counter-offensive, the People's Army liberated nine-tenths of the entire territory of South Korea and approximately ninety-two percent of its population in a short period.

    Enraged by the setbacks on the front lines, the interventionists resorted to barbaric means, slaughtering peaceful residents and destroying towns and villages on a large scale.

    All honest people in the world condemn American aggression and inhumane actions in Korea. The Soviet people and the Soviet government have resolutely stood up against the aggression of American imperialism and defended the Korean people.

    All those who cherish the fate of nations and the interests of universal peace stand on the side of the Soviet Union, which has submitted a correct plan to the Security Council for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

    The appeals to the Security Council from the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Union of Students, and other international democratic organizations have voiced the anger of human conscience. The tide of international support for the heroic Korean people is rising day by day. The central trade union organizations, women's and youth organizations, intellectuals, and representatives of clergy from various People's Democratic countries and Western European countries—the entire peace front, led by the great socialist nation of victory and composed of hundreds of millions of people, has demanded that the Security Council stop American intervention in Korea and restrain the organizers of the mass slaughter of the Korean people.

    The Security Council must listen to the voices of hundreds of millions of honest men and women! It has the responsibility to stop American aggression against Korea!

　　劳动报发表评论
    全世界人民声援朝鲜人民
    抗议美国罪行的愤怒呼声响彻全世界
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报发表题为“制止美国侵略者”的社论称：抗议美国干涉者在朝鲜罪行的愤怒呼声，已经响彻了全世界一切国家。
    美国帝国主义者发动了侵略朝鲜的这个罪恶的战争，但是他们低估了爱好自由的朝鲜人民源源不绝的力量，低估了全体人民所支持和同情的人民军的力量。
    人民军在进入反攻后，仅在短短的时间内便解放了南朝鲜全部领土的十分之九及其人口的百分之九十二左右。
    干涉者因前方失利而恼羞成怒，便进而采取野蛮手段大肆屠杀和平居民，摧毁城镇和乡村。
    世界上一切正直的人都痛斥美国在朝鲜的侵略和惨无人道的行动。苏联人民和苏联政府坚决地挺身而起，反对美国帝国主义的侵略，保卫朝鲜人民。
    凡珍视民族命运和普遍和平的利益的人们，都站在已向安理会提出和平解决朝鲜问题正确方案的苏联这一边。
    在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局、世界工联、国际学联及其他国际民主组织致安全理事会的呼吁中，发出了人类良心愤怒的呼声。对英勇的朝鲜人民的国际声援的浪潮，一天比一天高涨，各人民民主国家及西欧各国中央工会组织、妇女及青年组织、知识分子与牧师的代表们——以胜利的社会主义伟大国家为首的、由亿万人民组成的整个和平阵线，已向安理会提出了制止美国干涉朝鲜和遏制大规模屠杀朝鲜人民的组织者的要求。
    安全理事会必须倾听亿万正直男女的呼声！它有制止美国侵略朝鲜的责任！
