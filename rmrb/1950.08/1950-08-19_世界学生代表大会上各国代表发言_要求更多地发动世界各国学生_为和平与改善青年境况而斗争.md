Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th: The Second World Student Congress continued its sessions on the 16th.

　　In the morning session, delegates from various countries unanimously praised the work and activities of the International Union of Students (IUS), and emphasized the need to attract more students from all countries to fight for peace, freedom, and independence, and to fight for the improvement of the conditions of students and youth in capitalist and colonial countries.

　　Austrian democratic student representative Heiserer spoke. He criticized the speech made by Jenkins, chairman of the National Union of Students of England and Wales, on August 15th, considering it to be the rhetoric of spokesmen for the fascist Tito clique and warmongers. (Note: Jenkins opposed the activities of the IUS in his speech and refused to vote on a motion protesting the persecution of students). The Austrian representative demanded that Jenkins and his gang give a clear answer to the question of which path they were taking: were they with the IUS, which is striving for peace and democracy, or were they openly siding with the camp of the warmongers?

　　The speech by the student representative from the West Indies was a fierce accusation against British imperialism. He recounted how British imperialism cruelly oppressed the people of the West Indies and deprived students and youth of their right to education.

　　The audience warmly welcomed the speech by Sama, the democratic student representative from Malaya. Sama recounted how British imperialists were destroying the culture of the Malayan people and massacring the best representatives of the Malayan people, progressive professors and students. Sama emphasized that the brutality of British imperialism could never extinguish the flames of the Malayan people's struggle for freedom and independence.

　　French democratic student representative Connes and Albanian student representative Buhali spoke in succession. Buhali reported on the great achievements of the Albanian people in the development of national culture in recent years.

　　The head of the Soviet delegation, Shelepin, delivered a speech at the afternoon session. His speech was greeted with unparalleled enthusiasm by delegates from various countries. At the end of Shelepin's speech, the audience cheered for a long time for the Soviet delegation and the Communist Youth League, and for the great Stalin.

　　Polish student representative Radoz spoke out strongly against the American aggression in Korea and resolutely protested against the French authorities' persecution of Joliot-Curie, an outstanding fighter for peace. The Polish representative urged students from all countries to establish peace advocacy committees more widely and to sign the Stockholm Appeal for Peace. He proposed electing a student delegation to participate in the upcoming Second World Peace Congress.

　　The Polish delegation then proposed establishing scholarships in various countries specifically for students who have excelled in the movement to collect signatures for the peace declaration. When Radoz said, "We are part of the great camp of peace, with the Soviet Union, headed by the great Stalin, standing at the forefront of this camp," the sound of cheers for the great Stalin resounded throughout the venue once again.

　　Cypriot democratic student representative Nicenis said: The people and students of Cyprus want their country to become part of a free Greece, which should advance along the path of socialism together with its people's democratic neighbors. Nicenis said: We believe that the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are our best friends and allies in the struggle for freedom and national independence.

　　The last speaker was Bica, a representative of progressive students from Australia. On behalf of the Australian delegation, he expressed support for the report of the Executive Committee of the IUS.

　　Guests who spoke at the congress on the 16th included Professor Bernal, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, Soviet writer Tikhonov, and President of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Pavlov, among others. When Tikhonov congratulated the congress on behalf of the Soviet Peace Committee, the entire audience responded with enthusiastic cheers. Bernal delivered a speech calling on students and youth around the world to strengthen their unity in the struggle to defend peace and oppose warmongers.

　　The congress received congratulatory telegrams from Guo Moruo, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Peace Committee, several professors from the University of Berlin, and renowned biologist Professor Prinan, among others.

　　世界学生代表大会上各国代表发言
    要求更多地发动世界各国学生  为和平与改善青年境况而斗争
    【新华社十八日讯】综合塔斯社布拉格讯：第二届世界学生代表大会于十六日继续开会。
    在上午的会议上发言的各国代表一致赞成国际学联的工作和活动，并强调指出必须更多地吸引世界各国的学生，为各国的和平、自由与独立而斗争，为改善资本主义国家和殖民地国家中的学生青年的境况而斗争。
    奥地利民主学生代表海塞累发言。他抨击了英格兰和威尔士全国学生联盟主席詹金斯在八月十五日的发言，认为那是法西斯铁托集团发言人的论调，是新战争煽动家的发言人的论调（按：詹金斯曾在发言中反对国际学联的活动，并拒绝表决抗议迫害学生的议案）。奥地利的代表要求詹金斯一伙明确答复一个问题，就是他们究竟走那一条路：和争取和平和民主的国际学联在一起呢，还是公开投靠战争贩子的阵营？
    西印度的学生代表的演说，是对英国帝国主义者的激烈的控诉。他讲述了英国帝国主义如何残酷地压迫西印度人民，并且使学生和青年丧失了受教育的权利。
    会众热烈地欢迎了马来亚民主学生代表萨马的演说。萨马讲述英国帝国主义者怎样消灭马来亚人民的文化，屠杀马来亚人民的最优秀的代表人物，进步的教授和学生。萨马着重地说：英帝国主义的残暴行为，决不能熄灭马来亚人民为自由和独立而进行的斗争的火焰。
    法国民主学生代表康涅斯，和阿尔巴尼亚学生代表布海利相继发言。布海利报告了阿尔巴尼亚人民近年来在民族文化发展方面的巨大成就。
    苏联代表团团长谢利平在下午的会议上，发表演说。他的演说受到各国代表无比热烈的欢迎。谢利平讲演结束时，会众长久地为苏联代表团和共产主义青年团，为伟大斯大林而欢呼。
    波兰学生代表拉多兹发言痛斥美国侵略朝鲜，并坚决抗议法国当局迫害争取和平的杰出的斗士约里奥——居里的行为。波兰代表敦促世界各国的学生更广泛地建立拥护和平委员会，并在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名。他提议选举学生代表团参加即将到来的第二届世界拥护和平大会。
    波兰代表团继又提议设立各国奖学金，专门授予在为和平宣言征集签名的运动中成绩卓越的学生。当拉多兹说到“我们是伟大的和平阵营的一部分，以伟大的斯大林为首的苏联是站在这个阵营的前列的”之时，为伟大的斯大林欢呼的声音再度响彻了会场。
    塞浦路斯民主学生代表尼切尼斯说：塞浦路斯的人民与学生愿意他们的国家成为自由希腊的一部分，自由希腊应当与它的人民民主的邻国一道沿着社会主义的道路前进。尼切尼斯说：我们认为苏联和各人民民主国家是我们在争取自由和民族独立的斗争中最好的朋友和同盟者。
    最后发言的是澳大利亚进步学生的代表比喀。他代表澳大利亚代表团，表示赞成国际学联执委会的报告。
    十六日在大会上发言的来宾，有世界拥护和平大会常设委员会副主席贝尔纳教授，苏联作家吉洪诺夫，保加利亚科学院院长巴甫罗夫等人。吉洪诺夫代表苏联拥护和平委员会向大会祝贺时，全场报以热烈的欢呼。贝尔纳致词号召全世界的学生青年，在保卫和平、反对新战争煽动者的斗争中加强自己的团结。
    大会收到了中国保卫世界和平大会全国委员会主席郭沫若，柏林大学的若干教授和著名生物学家普里南教授等人的贺电。
