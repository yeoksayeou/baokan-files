　　Commemorating "August 1st" and Welcoming a New Upsurge in Cultural Learning

　　Bai Guibao, Squad Leader of the Third Squad of the Machine Gun and Artillery Company, a certain unit of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army

　　Editor's Note: Comrade Bai Guibao is the squad leader of the Third Squad of the Machine Gun and Artillery Company of a certain unit of the North China Military Region. Under his strong leadership, the squad received the title of Model Squad for Cultural Learning. In the period of more than half a year from January of this year to the present (including marching and production time), the entire squad has eliminated illiteracy below 700 characters. He himself and the study group leader Yang Zhangbao have recognized more than 1,500 characters. Six comrades are already able to write simple diaries. This article is Comrade Bai Guibao's radio broadcast script on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on July 31st in celebration of the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army on "August 1st" Army Day.

　　My name is Bai Guibao, and I am the squad leader of the Third Squad of the Machine Gun and Artillery Company of the Cavalry Unit of the Chahar Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. Because the higher-ups think I have achieved success in leading the entire squad in cultural learning, they asked me to broadcast on the Central People's Broadcasting Station to commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army on "August 1st" Army Day, which I am very happy to do. I am from a poor background, a native of Shangdu County, Chahar Province. I herded pigs for others from a young age until I was fourteen or fifteen years old, when I studied for two winter terms, but I couldn't afford to study anymore after that. At sixteen, I followed my father and older brother to suffer for the landlords for a full six years, so I hated the exploitation and oppression of feudal landlords and local tyrants and evil gentry of the old society from a young age. In 1946, I joined the People's Liberation Army and saw the various crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism. I made up my mind to overthrow these reactionary fellows. I was not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice in battle, made meritorious service, and gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

　　Last December, we started military training, and the higher-ups called on us to learn culture. At that time, I thought: all of our comrades in the squad were poor people in the old society, unable to afford to study, and suffered a lot. This time, the Party and the higher-ups are asking us to work hard to learn culture, and there are even teachers to teach us, so shouldn't we learn well? Besides, if we want to become a modern national defense army, use modern weapons, master military science, and improve politically, how can we do it without culture? Moreover, I am a Communist Party member and must be a model for the masses. I must be responsible to the Party and the people; administratively, I am the squad leader, and I must be responsible to the soldiers. I must do a good job in the cultural learning of this squad. Chairman Mao instructed us: The People's Liberation Army must become an army with culture. I often told these ideas to the comrades to make them realize the importance of cultural learning; I myself set an example, seized all spare time to study hard and practice hard, and motivated everyone.

　　At the very beginning of the learning, Comrade Shang Tiancai in our squad was unwilling to learn and would play whenever he had time. I talked to him and also asked all the comrades in the squad to help him, explaining patiently to him, and mobilized everyone to give him paper, pens, and ink. As a result, he was moved and willing to learn. I also often praised his achievements at squad meetings, so he slowly became active.

　　Comrade Xi Wenming, our deputy squad leader, was relatively slow-witted and not very motivated to learn, so I patiently said to him: "Don't worry, learn two or three characters a day, take it slowly." I was also responsible for teaching him every day, stroke by stroke, word by word, and he gained confidence. In this way, I mobilized the comrades in the squad who were unwilling to learn and those who were slow-witted, and they became interested in learning, and the entire squad's learning enthusiasm increased.

　　But difficulties came again. Everyone felt that the learning tools were not enough, so I decided to quit smoking and saved money to buy paper, ink, colors, and two fountain pens, and took them out for everyone to use in rotation. Because there were not enough fountain pens, I said: "Let's not let the pens be idle when people are idle, let's use them in turn." The comrades all said: "The squad leader is so good to us, if we still don't learn well, we will really be sorry to the squad leader, let's all quit smoking and buy paper, pens, and ink." As a result, everyone quit smoking. Later, everyone bought a lot of learning tools, and five comrades bought two fountain pens each.

　　After studying for a month, the number of characters learned increased, and the strokes became difficult. Some comrades lost confidence again. I said to everyone again: "Our People's Liberation Army can overcome any difficulties, and we shouldn't be afraid of difficulties in learning culture. The more characters you learn, the more you will know. If you know ten, you won't have to worry about twenty; if you know twenty, you won't have to worry about thirty. Anyway, you won't know if you don't learn, but you can't get fat in one bite. As long as you work hard to learn, you will definitely achieve results." I also thought of a way to start a competition for writing new words during extracurricular games. Whoever writes the new word with the fewest strokes loses. If you lose, you have to sing if you are asked to sing, and you have to do whatever you are asked to do. In this way, everyone competed to learn new words and learn words with many strokes, and the difficulties were overcome.

　　Later, we implemented "responsible teaching and guaranteed learning, mutual teaching and mutual learning." I taught the deputy squad leader, study group leader Yang Zhangbao taught Zhang Wensheng, and Guo Mingyuan taught Wang Chaobin. I also told the comrades who were teaching: "Don't worry, be patient with them. He is more anxious than you if he can't learn."

　　In addition, the deputy squad leader was relatively slow-witted, and comrades Shang Tiancai and Wang Chaobin had fallen behind in learning in the past, so we let him do fewer duties. For example, others were asked to replace him in chopping grass, feeding horses, walking horses, and cleaning, to give them more time to study, so that the whole squad's learning could develop in a balanced way.

　　After learning got started, taking advantage of this enthusiasm, we held a meeting to discuss what to learn and what to do. Everyone was asked to think of ways. Comrade Wang Cai said: "Let's learn the names of the people in our company first." Comrade Wang Chaobin said: "In addition to responsible teaching and guaranteed learning, mutual teaching and mutual learning, we also have to test each other." I proposed to test twice a week and summarize the test on Sunday. The results should be announced in the squad. The good ones should be learned from, and the bad ones should be criticized. Everyone agreed and unanimously passed it, so they were very happy to do it. Once, when the results were announced, Wang Chaobin only got 56 points. When it came time to hold a review meeting, before everyone could speak, he said: "I have fallen behind this time. Guo Mingyuan and Yang Zhangbao are all above 90 points; I must catch up next time." In the second announcement of the test results, he got 92 points.

　　The deputy squad leader, the study group leader, and I often discussed the learning situation of our squad, studied the methods of collective leadership, and divided the work. I was responsible for supervising, inspecting, and testing; the deputy squad leader was responsible for controlling the learning time, and would gather everyone to study whenever there was time; the study group leader was responsible for specific teaching. Later, I made a registration book and recorded the new words that the comrades learned every day in that book as a basis for inspection, supervision, criticism, and commendation. In this way, we ensured that our learning plan could be completed and consolidated the learning results. In three months of training, everyone learned more than 300 characters.

　　In order to achieve the "four abilities," that is, being able to write, read, use, and explain, we let the comrades learn to use the characters. I asked them to practice writing sentences with the characters they had learned in the past. At the same time, fearing that the comrades would forget the old ones when they learned new ones, I explained the new words taught by the cultural teacher to them again every day. And I read "Comrade-in-arms" magazine and newspapers to them in extracurricular activities, so that they would not forget learning at any time. Now they have all developed the habit of learning. Whenever they have time, they unconsciously start learning, either learning from each other or testing each other.

　　In early April, we participated in the Chahar Province's water conservancy construction and went to the Sanggan River to dig canals. During the march, we used two methods to persist in learning:

　　First, I cut a lot of paper strips in advance, and wrote four to five new words on each paper strip according to each comrade's ability to recognize characters, and gave them to them every morning before the march, so that they could learn them during the march and during breaks, and hand them back in the evening when camping.

　　Second, in the past, learning to use characters was writing sentences, but now I asked them to write written reports, writing out the individual's marching situation on the day, regardless of the number of words, and correcting their mistakes. In this way, we learned 36 characters during the eight-day march.

　　After starting production, in addition to adhering to the previous learning system, we also made literacy cards, wrote the new words to be learned on the day, and whoever didn't know them could look at the cards, write the difficult-to-remember words on the hoe handle, the carrying pole, and the arm, and practice more. When it was time to rest, they would teach each other and test each other, or collectively read "Comrade-in-arms". I also organized them to submit two articles to the wall newspaper every week and write a letter home every month and a half or two months, reporting our production and learning situation. In this way, during production, three of us learned more than 200 characters, and six learned more than 300 characters. Now the entire squad has eliminated illiteracy below 700 characters. ... Comrade Yang Zhangbao, the study group leader, and I have recognized 1,500 characters, and six comrades can write diaries.

　　Our squad's cultural learning has achieved some results. This is due to the correct leadership and education of the Party and the higher-ups, and the hard work of all the comrades. Commemorating the "August 1st" Army Day, our entire squad is determined to respond to the call of the higher-ups, welcome the future upsurge of cultural learning, and train ourselves into soldiers of a strong national defense army with a high level of cultural accomplishment.

　　纪念“八一”，迎接新的文化学习高潮
    人民解放军华北军区某部机炮连第三班班长  白贵宝
    编者按：白贵宝同志是华北军区某部机炮连第三班班长。在他的坚强领导之下，得到了文化学习模范班的称号。第三班从今年一月到现在半年多时间内（连行军、生产时间在内），全班已消灭了七百字以下的文盲。他自己和学习组长杨章保已认了一千五百多字。有六个同志已经能够写简单的日记了。这篇文章，是白贵宝同志为庆祝“八一”建军节，于七月三十一日在中央人民广播电台的广播稿。
    我叫白贵宝，我是人民解放军察哈尔军区骑兵部队机炮连第三班班长。因为上级认为我领导全班文化学习有成绩，要我在纪念“八一”人民解放军建军二十三周年的时候，到中央人民广播电台来广播，我很乐意。我是个穷苦人出身，是察哈尔省商都县的人，从小给人家放猪，一直到十四、五岁上才念了两个冬天的书，以后想念也念不起了。十六岁上就跟着父亲和哥哥给地主受苦，整整受了六年，所以我从小就痛恨旧社会封建地主和土豪劣绅的剥削压迫。一九四六年我参加了人民解放军，又看到了国民党反动派和美国帝国主义的种种罪恶，我就打定主意要打倒这些反动家伙。我在战斗中不怕流血牺牲，立了功，同时光荣的加入了中国共产党。
    去年十二月我们开始练兵，上级号召学习文化，那时候我就想：我们全班的同志，在旧社会里，都是穷苦人，念不起书，受了很多苦，这回党和上级让我们努力学文化，还有教员来教我们，我们还不好好的学？再说我们要成为现代化的国防军、要使用现代武器，掌握军事科学，提高政治，没有文化怎么能行呢？而且我是个共产党员，得做群众的模范，我要对党对人民负责；行政上我是班长，我得对战士们负责，一定要把本班的文化学习搞好。毛主席指示我们：人民解放军要成为有文化的军队，我就把这些意思经常给同志们讲，让他们认识文化学习的重要；我自己以身作则，抓紧一切空余时间苦学苦练，带动大家。
    学习刚一开始，我们班的尚天才同志就不愿意学习，有时间就玩，我和他谈话，还让全班同志帮助他，耐心的向他解释，又动员大家送给他纸、笔、墨水，结果他受了感动，愿意学习了，我又经常在班务会上表扬他的成绩，这样他就慢慢的积极起来了。
    我们副班长席文明同志，心眼比较笨，学习不大起劲，我就耐心的跟他说：“不要着急，一天学两个三个的字、慢慢来。”我又负责每天一笔一划一个字一个字的教他，他也有了信心。这样我就把班里不愿意学习和心眼笨的同志，都动员起来，他们有了学习的兴趣，全班的学习情绪就高起来了。
    可是困难又来了，大家都感觉学习工具不够用，我就下决心戒烟，省下钱买了纸、墨水、颜色、还有两枝钢笔，拿出来给大家使换。因为钢笔不够用，我就说：“咱们人闲笔别闲，轮流着用。”同志们都说：“班长对咱们这么好，咱们再学不好，真对不起班长，咱们也都戒烟买纸、笔、墨水吧。”结果大家都戒了烟。以后大家都买了不少学习用具，有五个同志每人买了两枝钢笔。
    学习了一个月以后，学的字多了，笔划也难了，有的同志就又失去了信心。我又跟大家说：“我们解放军什么困难都能克服，学文化也不要怕难。字越学越多，会十个就不愁二十个，会二十个不愁三十个，反正不学习是不会，可是一口也吃不成胖子，只要努力学，一定有成绩。”我又想了一个办法，就在课外游戏的时候，发动大家比赛写生字玩，谁写的生字笔划最少，谁就算输，输了让你唱你就得唱，让你干啥你就得干啥。这样一来，大家争着学生字，学笔划多的字，这样就把困难克服下去了。
    后来我们实行了“包教保学，互教互学”，我教副班长，学习组长杨章保教张文生，郭明元教王超斌。我又跟教的同志们说“不要着急，对他们要耐心，他学不会比你还着急。”
    另外，副班长比较笨，尚天才和王超斌同志过去在学习上拉下了，我们就让他少出勤务。比如：铡草，喂马，遛马，打扫清洁卫生，就让别人代替，多给他们学习时间，使全班学习平衡发展。
    学习入了门以后，趁着这个热火，开了一个会，讨论作啥学啥。让大家想办法，王才同志说：“先学咱们连的人名字”，王超斌同志说：“除了包教保学，互教互学，咱们还得互相测验”。我提出一个礼拜测验两次，礼拜日总结测验，成绩要在班上公布，好的大家向他学习，坏的要批评。大家都赞成，一致通过，所以作起来很高兴。有一次公布成绩，王超斌只得了五十六分，到开检讨会时，没等大家发言，他先说了：“我这次落了后，人家郭明元、杨章保都在九十分以上；我下次非得赶上去不行。”在第二次公布测验成绩的时候，他得了九十二分。
    我和副班长和学习组长，经常讨论我们班的学习情况，研究集体领导的办法，又分了工。我负责督促、检查、测验；副班长负责掌握学习时间，有空就集合大家学习；学习组长负责具体的教。以后我又作了一个登记本，把同志们每天学的生字，都记在那个本上，作为检查、督促、批评、和表扬的根据。就这样，保证了我们的学习计划能够完成，巩固了学习成绩。三个月练兵，每个人学了三百多字。
    为了作到四会，就是会写、会念、会用、会讲，让同志们学着用字。我就叫他们把过去学过的字，练习写话，同时，怕同志们学了新的忘了旧的，我每天把文化教员教的生字，再给他们讲一遍。并且在课外给他们读“战友”杂志，读报，让他们一时一刻不忘学习。现在他们都养成了学习的习惯，一有时间不知不觉的就学习起来，不是互相学习，就是互相测验。
    四月初，我们参加察哈尔省兴修水利，到桑乾河去开渠，在行军当中，我们用了两个办法坚持学习：
    第一、我事先裁了好多纸条，每个纸条根据每个同志的认字能力，写上四个到五个生字，在每天早晨行军以前交给他们，让他们在行军当中、休息当中学会，晚上宿营的时候交回来。
    第二、过去学着用字是写话，现在我让他们写书面汇报，写出当天个人行军的情况，不拘字数多少，写错的给他们改正，这样在八天行军当中，我们都写会了三十六个字。
    开始生产以后，除了坚持以前的学习制度以外，另外我们作了识字牌，写上当天要学的生字，谁不会就看看牌子，把难记的字写在铣把上、扁担上、胳臂上，多写多练，一到休息的时候，就互相教互相测验，或者集体读“战友”。我又组织他们每周每人给墙报投稿两篇，一个半月或者两个月，给家里写一封平安信，报告我们的生产情况、学习情况。这样在生产当中，我们有三个人学会了二百多字，六个人学会了三百多字。现在全班已经消灭了七百字以下的文盲。……我和学习组长杨章保同志，已经识到一千五百字，有六个同志能作日记了。
    我们班的文化学习是有了一些成绩，这是党和上级正确的领导和教育、同志们大家努力得来的。纪念“八一”建军节，我们全班有决心，响应上级的号召，迎接今后文化学习的高潮，把我们锻炼成有高度文化修养的强大的国防军的战士。
