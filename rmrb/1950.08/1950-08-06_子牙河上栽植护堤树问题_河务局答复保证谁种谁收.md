The Question of Planting Protective Trees on the Ziya River Dike
	The River Affairs Bureau Replies Guaranteeing Whoever Plants, Harvests
	Comrade Yang Dahua's Suggestion
	Editor:
	The Ziya River Dike in Hebei Province, after being reinforced by the People's Liberation Army soldiers, appears even more solid. However, this dike is bare, and no farmer is willing to plant a single tree. I investigated the reason, and the masses said: In the past, people could at least gather some branches and firewood here, but now even that is controlled by the dike patrol, so who would want to plant trees?
	The dike is 25 feet high. If alfalfa is planted every mile, the harvest would be considerable. If three rows of willow trees are planted on the dike, eight to nine thousand catties of willow branches can be produced every year. Planting four rows of trees on the top and outer slope of the dike can produce a lot of firewood every year, and after ten years, they can grow into good timber. This will not only greatly increase the wealth of the people, but also enhance the dike's ability to prevent floods.
	The rainy season is coming, which is the season for planting willows. I suggest that the Ziya River Affairs Bureau should change its method of relying solely on dike patrols to protect the dike. It should notify the relevant governments along the river to cooperate with river affairs personnel to sign contracts with the masses, guaranteeing that whoever plants the trees on the dike will harvest them, and launch a tree planting campaign.

	The Reply from the Ziya River Affairs Bureau
	Comrade Yang Dahua:
	Your suggestion is very good.
	Launching the masses to plant willow trees on the newly repaired dikes of the Ziya River during the upcoming rainy season is one of the ways to protect the dikes. The reason why this was not done in the past is:
	(1)	The main reason is that the work of planting trees to protect the dikes was not well integrated with the interests of the local masses. The ownership of the benefits from planting trees was not clear, so the masses were afraid that they would not get any benefits after planting, and many people were unwilling to plant.
	(2)	The government focused on calling for and arranging the work of planting willows along the river, but did not go deep into mobilizing, inspecting, and protecting, resulting in no achievements or damage to the seedlings.
	(3)	There was a contradiction between the annual dike soil repair and tree planting.
	Due to these reasons, the work of planting trees on the dikes has not been done well. We accept past lessons and prepare to improve tree planting work according to the current needs:
	(1)	Extensively carry out the movement of planting willow trees to protect the dikes among the masses along the river. Deeply publicize the principle of "whoever plants, harvests," sign agreements, dispel the concerns of the masses, and closely integrate dike protection work with the interests of the masses.
	(2)	The land at the roots of the dikes on both sides of the main dike, which has been allocated to public ownership or purchased at a price, must be strengthened for dike patrol and planted with trees. If there is no ability to complete it, it can be planted by the original households, clearly stating who will own the future benefits, signing contracts, and distributing according to proportions to ensure the completion of the task.
	(3)	The local government is responsible for strict management and protection of the trees on the dikes.
	In addition, it is not suitable to plant large trees with thick trunks and deep roots on the dike slopes (they can be planted near the dike roots), because there is a danger of breaches during heavy rains or strong winds. Only plants such as basket willows are suitable for planting on the dike. It is not suitable to plant alfalfa, castor, and other crops on the dike, because they will make it difficult to detect leaks and weak spots during the flood season. Therefore, the government has ordered the removal of such crops that were planted in the past.

### 子牙河上栽植护堤树问题  河务局答复保证谁种谁收

　　子牙河上栽植护堤树问题
    河务局答复保证谁种谁收
    杨大化同志的建议编辑同志：
    河北省子牙河大堤，经人民解放军的战士们培修后，显得更坚实了；可是这条大堤，却是光光的，农民谁也不愿去栽一棵树。我调查了一下原因，群众说：早先人们还能在这儿打把条子，打筐柴草，可是现在连这也全被巡堤员管起来了，谁还愿去养树呢？
    堤高两丈五尺，如果每里地种上苜蓿，收获一定不少。如在堤上栽上三行柳树，每年可产八九千斤柳条。堤顶和外坡种上四行树，每年可产很多烧柴，十年之后，就可长成很好的材料。这样，不但为人民增加了很大的一笔财富，更可增强堤身预防洪水的能力。
    雨季到来，正是植柳的季节。我建议子牙河务局应改变单靠巡堤员保护堤防的办法，通知沿河有关政府配合河务人员与群众订立合同，保证堤上所植树木谁种谁收，开展一个植树运动。
            杨大化
    子牙河务局的答复杨大化同志：
    你的建议很好。
    在雨季将到的时候，发动群众，在子牙河段培修的新堤上插柳植树，是保护堤防的办法之一。过去没有这样作的原因是：
    （一）主要的是植树护堤工作，没有与当地群众利益很好结合起来；植树的收益属谁也不明确，因此群众怕栽后将来得不到利益，好多群众不愿栽植。
    （二）政府对沿河植柳工作，偏重于号召布置，没有深入发动与检查、保护，以致工作无成绩，或树苗遭到破坏。
    （三）每年堤土的培修与植树存在着矛盾。
    由于这些原因，河堤植树工作就没有作好。我们接受以往的教训，准备根据目前的需要，改进植树工作：
    （一）广泛开展沿河群众插柳护堤运动。深入宣传“谁种谁收”的原则，订立公约，打破群众顾虑，使护堤工作与群众利益密切结合起来。
    （二）沿大堤两边的堤根地已划归公有或经发价收买者，必须加强巡堤工作，并栽植树木；若无力完成，可由各原地户去栽植，明确说明将来的收益归谁，订立合同，按比例分配，保证完成任务。
    （三）责成当地政府严加管理，保护河堤树木。
    此外，堤坡上不宜于植粗干深根的大树（可以在堤根附近栽植），因为大水时或发生大风雨时会有决口的危险。堤上只适宜于插植簸箕柳等类植物。堤上不宜种苜蓿、大麻子等作物，因为在汛期会使人不易发现漏洞、垠眼。所以过去种的这类作物，政府已令铲除。
