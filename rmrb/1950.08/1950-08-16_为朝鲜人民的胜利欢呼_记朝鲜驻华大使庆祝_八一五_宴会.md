　　Cheering for the Victory of the Korean People
　　A Record of the Korean Ambassador to China's Banquet Celebrating "August 15th"
　　By Our Correspondent Gao Ji
　　Amidst the victorious advance in resisting the American imperialist aggressors, the Korean people are welcoming the fifth anniversary of their liberation - "August 15th" - with unparalleled enthusiasm and confidence. All peace-loving people around the world extend their greatest respect and love to the heroic Korean people in their struggle and cheer for their victory. The Korean people have stood up! The victory of the Korean people inspires the confidence of all peace-loving people around the world to fight resolutely for peace.
　　Yesterday, in the capital of People's China, the Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, Li Zhouyuan, held a grand celebratory banquet. Under the great portraits of Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung, people enthusiastically toasted and applauded the great victory of the Korean people again and again. Chairman Mao's appearance added even more excitement and brilliance to the event. People welcomed the leader of the Chinese people with prolonged applause. After Ambassador Li Zhouyuan delivered his speech, Chairman Mao spoke, and his words were warmly welcomed by the entire audience. When the Soviet Ambassador spoke, when the Polish Ambassador spoke, when the head of the German delegation spoke, when the Czech Ambassador spoke, when the Hungarian Ambassador spoke, when the Mongolian Ambassador spoke, people heard the same voices again and again: The victory of the heroic Korean people is the victory of the people of all countries fighting for peace! Long live the heroic Korean people! Long live the great victory of the Korean people! Commander-in-Chief Zhu De stood up and said: The victory of the Korean people is a powerful sanction against the American imperialist aggressors! These words were also powerfully engraved in people's hearts.
　　At such a grand gathering, the leader of the Chinese people and the envoys to China from various countries of the peace and democracy camp congratulated the Korean people on their great victory with the same emotions and the same confidence in victory. This fact demonstrates the place of the Korean people's cause of fighting for peace in the common cause of the people of all countries around the world.
　　After the grand banquet, two Korean newsreels were shown on the spot. The first was a documentary about the Korean people celebrating the fourth anniversary of "August 15th." From the beautiful scenes, people could see the majestic lineup of the Korean People's Army and the Korean working people peacefully and joyfully celebrating their festival. The second film recorded the atrocities of the barbarous air force of American imperialism and the truth about the bombing and massacre of peaceful cities and innocent people in the rear by the Koreans. Seeing the piles of rubble and the piles of corpses, people could not restrain their boundless hatred for imperialism! Other scenes in this film showed the embarrassing appearance of American prisoners of war escorted to Pyongyang, walking with their heads down, receiving the angry accusations of the Korean people standing on both sides. Let the imperialist warmongers take a look! This is the end of the aggressors and the barbarous armies of the aggressors.
　　The Korean people have heroically stood up and are victoriously advancing in the shameless struggle against American imperialist aggression! With the same unparalleled confidence, people bid farewell to the hosts of the Korean Embassy!

　　为朝鲜人民的胜利欢呼
    记朝鲜驻华大使庆祝“八一五”宴会
    本报记者  高集
    在抗击美帝国主义侵略者的胜利进军声中，朝鲜人民以无比的热情和信心迎接着自己获得解放的节日——“八、一五”五周年纪念。全世界爱好和平的人类，对英勇斗争中的朝鲜人民都寄以最大的敬意和热爱，都为着朝鲜人民的胜利而欢呼。朝鲜人民站起来了！朝鲜人民的胜利，鼓舞着全世界爱好和平的人类为和平而坚决斗争的信心。
    昨天，在人民中国的首都，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李周渊举行了盛大的庆祝宴会。在斯大林、毛泽东、金日成的巨像下，人们为着朝鲜人民的伟大胜利而热情地，一次再次地干杯，鼓掌。毛主席的出现，给盛会增加了更多更大的兴奋和光彩。人们以历久不息的掌声，迎接着中国人民的领袖。在李周渊大使致词后，毛主席讲话了，他的话受到全场热烈的欢迎。在苏联大使讲话的时候，在波兰大使讲话的时候，在罗马尼亚大使讲话的时候，在德国代表团团长讲话的时候，在捷克大使讲话的时候，在匈牙利大使讲话的时候，在蒙古大使讲话的时候，人们一次再次地听到这样的声音：英勇的朝鲜人民的胜利就是为和平而斗争的各国人民的胜利！英勇的朝鲜人民万岁！朝鲜人民的伟大胜利万岁！朱总司令站起来讲话说：朝鲜人民的胜利就是对美帝国主义侵略者的有力的制裁！这话也同样有力地铭刻在人们的心上。
    这样的一个盛会上，中国人民的领袖和和平民主阵营各国在中国的使节，以同样的感情，同样的胜利的信心向朝鲜人民祝贺他们的伟大胜利，这一个事实说明了朝鲜人民为和平而斗争的事业在全世界各国人民的共同事业中的地位了。
    盛宴过后，当场放映了两部朝鲜新闻影片。第一部是朝鲜人民庆祝“八·一五”四周年的纪录片。人们从美丽的画面上可以看到朝鲜人民军的雄壮阵容，以及朝鲜劳动人民在和平欢愉地庆祝自己的节日。第二部影片纪录了美帝国主义野蛮空军的兽行，以及朝鲜的和平城市和无辜的后方人民惨遭轰炸屠杀的真象。看到那成堆的瓦砾和成堆的尸体，人们是无法制止住自己对帝国主义的无边的愤恨的！这部影片的另一些画面上，则是被押解到平壤的美国战俘的狼狈形状，他们垂头丧气地走着，接受着站在两旁的朝鲜人民的愤怒的斥责。让帝国主义战争贩子来看一看吧！这就是侵略者和侵略者野蛮军队的结局。
    朝鲜人民英勇地站起来了，而且在对美帝国主义无耻的侵略斗争中胜利地前进着！怀着同样无比深厚的信心，人们向朝鲜大使馆的主人们告别了！
