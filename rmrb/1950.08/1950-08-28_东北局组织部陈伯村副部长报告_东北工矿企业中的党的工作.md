　　Northeast Bureau Organization Department Deputy Minister Chen Bocun Report
    Party Work in Northeast Industrial and Mining Enterprises

    [Our Newspaper] The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an industrial work conference on August 2nd. Chen Bocun, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau, gave a report at the meeting on the current party work in industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China. The report pointed out the leadership, guarantee, and supervisory role of party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises in production.

    Comrade Chen Bocun first explained the basic situation of the party in industrial and mining enterprises: As of May this year, there were 96,753 party members in industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China, accounting for 14.8 percent of the 670,000 employees in existing state-owned industrial and mining enterprises.

    The party in industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China mainly developed during the New Record Movement. The majority of party members are skilled, long-serving, and active individuals in production. The quality of new party members is mostly good. The vast majority of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises have established party branches, and the branch secretaries of workshops generally do not detach themselves from production. This has brought the party organization closer to production. Over the past year, the work of party branches in industrial and mining enterprises has undergone considerable changes. Some have begun to study production, and most party members can play an exemplary leading role in production, enabling the branches to play a certain role in guaranteeing and supervising production. Preliminary experience has been gained in how the party should work in industrial and mining enterprises, and more than 20 relatively good branches and general branches have been cultivated.

    Party member education: According to statistics from the four directly-administered cities of Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi, the party schools and training classes run by the municipal party committees have trained more than 5,000 party members, but in general, there is a lack of planning and insufficient education directly related to production. Since May of last year, a large number of relatively outstanding cadres have been transferred from various fields to the industrial sector. Over the past year, a large number of new cadres have been promoted. According to recent statistics from Shenyang, there are more than 1,200 workshop branch secretaries, field directors, and union branch directors. Therefore, the party has initially established a relatively good foundation in terms of organization.

    Comrade Chen Bocun then pointed out the two main problems existing in the party in industrial and mining enterprises:

    (1) In general, the role played by branches of industrial and mining enterprises in assisting and guaranteeing the implementation of production plans is not large enough.

    Some branches stand outside of production and shout empty guarantees. Many party branch activities are mostly limited to the narrow circle of party affairs work, detached from production plans, and rarely coordinated with production. For example, the current focus of production is to improve quality, but the branch is isolated in electing model party members. Some branches believe that supervision is the responsibility of a few members of the branch party committee or even the branch or party committee secretary alone. Some even think that supervision is the party secretary vying for power with the factory director. The party's role in enterprises is not significant, and one of the important roots of this is that many urban party committees and factory party committees leave "facing production," "centering on production," and "guaranteeing and supervising production" at the level of general slogans. The work of the Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau is also not in-depth, there is not much understanding of the situation, and it has not been able to promptly inspect and summarize work and guide the lower levels.

    (2) The scope and methods of party activities in enterprises are very narrow, mostly revolving around party members, failing to unite the masses, and even showing some serious phenomena of detachment from the masses. Most branches do not know how to lead the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and there are two deviations of either ignoring them or taking over everything. This prevents the party from effectively strengthening leadership and closely uniting the masses through party members in the trade union and the Communist Youth League, taking unified steps, and doing a good job in production. The unsoundness of the current trade union work and the failure to promptly correct certain erroneous ideas are related to the above-mentioned shortcomings in the leadership of the party committee. The party has developed very rapidly, and new party members have not been given systematic education. Certain guild-like gang ideas of the past, reflected in the party's relationship with the masses, show a very strong sectarian habit, refusing to absorb some advanced workers into the party, party and league members being rated higher than the masses in terms of salary; leaders treating party and league members differently, and adopting discriminatory attitudes towards technical personnel and staff. The party is open, but most of the party's activities are not open. It does not know how to promptly summarize the spirit and experience actively created by the broad masses, causing party members to become estranged from the masses and detached from the masses. Some outstanding individuals are afraid of being isolated after joining the party.

    Comrade Chen Bocun finally emphasized how to improve the party's role in production in the future:

    (1) Strengthen the party's sense of responsibility and role in guaranteeing and supervising the completion of production plans in enterprises. Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed us that guaranteeing and supervising is to "mobilize and organize the masses to assist and guarantee the implementation of the factory's plan and to fight against phenomena that hinder the implementation of these plans." That is, the party organization must guarantee the smooth completion of the tasks given to the enterprise by the state and implement the main issues raised in the report of Minister Wang Heshou of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government: namely, strengthening the operation and management of enterprises to reduce costs and improve quality, eliminating waste in production, strengthening the unity of all employees, steadily carrying out capital construction, and cultivating reserve forces. The enterprise party must regard the implementation of these tasks as its greatest responsibility. How these tasks are implemented is the standard for measuring the quality of the enterprise party's work in the future.

    According to the experience of factories that have done a relatively good job, there are mainly the following four points:

    First, the party branch of an industrial and mining enterprise takes doing a good job in production as its basic task and implements it in actual work and in all aspects of branch activities, rather than just staying at the level of words and meetings. Second, the party organization does not shout empty slogans, nor does it generally study production, but specifically leads, specifically analyzes the situation, studies difficult and favorable conditions, grasps the key points, clearly puts forward specific goals and the key issues that must be resolved to achieve this goal. Then, through various organizations and methods, the party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League take unified steps and implement it throughout the party and the factory; and continue to conduct in-depth inspections, promptly discover and overcome new difficulties and problems, cultivate typical examples, summarize experiences, educate cadres, and break through backward departments to make it implemented.

    Third, the party's work is carried out from the perspective of ideological leadership, that is, political work, using the method of persuasion and education; and in carrying out the above work, it strengthens leadership and contacts the broad masses through party members in the trade union and the Communist Youth League.

    Fourth, party workers in industrial and mining enterprises must be familiar with industry, study production technology, learn knowledge of operation and management, and maintain close contact with technical personnel, staff, and skilled workers to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity.

    The main task of the enterprise party at present is to guarantee the implementation of strengthening the operation and management of the enterprise. The party should carefully study and put forward specific measures for the party to implement this main task. The party committee and branch should specifically study how a factory or workshop can reduce costs, improve quality, and implement economic accounting systems, what problems exist in this regard, and what methods should be adopted to solve them. Formulate specific plans among party members and advanced workers to save raw materials, save electricity, reduce the scrap rate, and produce products that are cheap, beautiful, and easy to sell in the market, promptly check and summarize experience, and at any time coordinate with the administration to correct various deviations, etc.

    The enterprise party actively and fully exerts its guaranteeing and supervising role in production, which is the basic key to doing a good job in the relationship between the party and the government. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome the tendency of some party workers to passively be dissatisfied with the administration without actively striving to do a good job in production.

    (2) The party must be good at leading the masses. Unite all employees to work together. This requires:

    Educate party members to learn how to do mass work. Through the exemplary leading role of party members themselves and patient persuasion and education work to the masses, improve the class consciousness of the masses, and turn the party's policies and resolutions into the conscious and voluntary actions of all employees. For this reason, all party work should be carried out openly. Party meetings should often invite active elements from the masses to participate, overcoming and preventing all bad tendencies of detachment from the masses.

    Strengthen the party's leadership over the trade union and the Communist Youth League. All production, life, and learning issues related to employees and the masses must be carried out through the party groups and party members of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, through the organizations of the trade union and the Communist Youth League. At the same time, the party must regularly and frequently discuss the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League. It must recognize that strengthening the trade union and the Communist Youth League is also strengthening the party's work. It must overcome the two deviations of taking over everything and ignoring them.

    (3) Transform the leadership style of the enterprise party. It must frequently go deep into lower-level organizations, deep into the production process, and specifically study: how to assist the administration in running the factory well with the methods of political work, how to embody the party's political leadership from specific economic activities, and how to cultivate and improve new backbones from the work of inspecting and specifically helping lower-level organizations. This is a key issue in strengthening the role of the enterprise party at present; if it is still a generalized call, an empty instruction without studying the business and specifically leading, the task of guaranteeing and supervising will be impossible to achieve. The party committee and general branch should frequently and in a focused and planned way go deep into the branch and the site, promptly grasp various actual situations in production, and specifically and accurately deploy work to the lower levels, and put forward specific methods for the party to guarantee production that truly meet actual needs. (Regarding various policies, orders, and instructions from higher-level industrial departments, the party committee and general branch should frequently and actively pay attention to understanding them. In order to facilitate the party organization's research on how to guarantee production and promptly instruct the lower-level parties to assist in implementation, the administration of large enterprises should first report to the municipal party committee whenever it receives new orders or instructions from higher levels. Important reports related to production in the enterprise administration must be sent to the municipal party committee on time. enterprise party committee.)

    (4) Consolidate the party organization and cautiously develop party members.

    Do not develop party members during the party rectification period. During this period, focus on checking work, improving cadres, educating party members, educating workers, and carrying out key rectification. Consolidate the party organization to prepare conditions for continued development in the future.

    The content of education for new party members focuses on the following issues:

    First, the responsibility of party members in industrial production, combined with class education and education to support the war, and education on the sense of responsibility as masters (completing the state's production plan is the most basic responsibility of party members in the enterprise), and improving their class consciousness. Second, the party's policies. Conduct education based on the instructions of the higher-level party and the orders and instructions of the higher-level administration. Currently, focus on implementing economic accounting (such as improving quality, reducing costs, saving raw materials, and taking care of machines), the policy of uniting technical personnel and uniting the entire working class. Enable party members to consciously abide by it and persuade employees to implement it. Third, the principles and working methods of the party contacting the masses and having to lead the masses forward.

    In strengthening education, people who have not changed after repeated education, have very bad work styles, and are indeed not qualified as party members should be cleaned up using appropriate methods, but the expulsion of party members must be discussed by the branch general meeting and approved by the municipal committee's large industrial and mining party committee.

    After the party organization has been consolidated for a period of time, it should cautiously adopt a strict review policy to develop.

    At present, the number of parties in our Northeast industrial and mining industry is quite large, and the quality is also relatively good. The key to how to fully exert the party's strength to guarantee that enterprises are run well lies in the party organizations at all levels clarifying the idea of ​​doing everything to run production well, and quickly transforming our past leadership style that was not in-depth and specific enough, delving deeply into research, uniting all employees, and striving to complete the glorious tasks given by the party and the state.

　　东北局组织部陈伯村副部长报告
    东北工矿企业中的党的工作
    【本报讯】中共中央东北局于八月二日召开了工业工作会议。东北局组织部陈伯村副部长在会议上作了关于目前东北工矿企业党的工作的报告。报告中指出了工矿企业中党组织的领导和保证与监督生产的作用。
    陈伯村同志首先说明目前工矿党的基本情况：至今年五月统计，东北已有工矿党员九六、七五三人，占现有国营工矿企业职工六十七万人的百分之十四点八。
    东北工矿企业中的党主要是在新纪录运动中发展起来的。党员的大多数均为有技术的、工龄较长的生产中的积极分子。新党员质量大部分是好的。国营工矿的绝大部分已建立了党的支部，车间支书一般均不脱离生产。这样，使党的组织与生产接近了一步。一年来，工矿企业党的支部工作获得了相当转变，一部分已开始钻研生产，大部分党员能在生产中起模范带头作用，使支部在保证与监督生产上起了一定的作用，初步获得了工矿党如何工作的经验，并培养出约二十多个比较好的支部和总支。
    党员教育：据沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪四个直属市统计，市委所办党校与党训班共训练党员五千以上，但一般的缺乏计划，与生产直接联系的教育不够。去年五月起，从各方面抽调了大批较优秀的干部到工业部门。一年来并已提拔了大批的新干部，据沈阳最近统计：车间支书、场主任、工会分会主任以上共一千二百多。因此，党在组织上已初步建立了一个比较好的基础。
    陈伯村同志继即指出现时工矿党中存在的两个主要问题：
    （一）一般工矿企业支部在协助与保证生产计划的实施上所起的作用还不够大。
    有些支部站在生产之外，空喊保证。不少党的支部活动，多限在狭小的党务工作圈子内，离开生产计划，很少与生产配合，如当前生产中心是提高质量，支部却孤立搞模范党员的选举。有些支部以为监督是支部党委几个委员甚至支部或党委书记个人的事。甚至以为监督是党的书记与厂长争权。党在企业中的作用不大，其重要根源之一乃是不少城市党委与工厂党委把“面向生产”、“围绕生产”、“保证监督生产”停留在一般口号上。东北局组织部的工作亦不深入，情况了解不多，未能及时检查与总结工作，指导下面。
    （二）企业中党的活动范围、方式均甚窄狭，多在党员中打圈子，不会团结群众，甚至有某些脱离群众的严重现象。多数支部不会领导工会、青年团，对它们存在着不闻不问或包办代替两种偏向。使党不能很好地通过工会与青年团中的党员，加强领导，密切团结群众，齐一步伐，搞好生产。目前工会工作中的不健全及某些错误思想未能及时纠正，是与党委领导上的上述缺点有关系的。党的发展甚快，对新党员，未及进行系统教育，过去的某些行会帮口思想，反映在党群众关系上则是宗派主义习气甚为浓厚，拒绝吸收某些先进工人入党，党团员薪金比群众评得高；领导上对党团员另眼看待，以及对技术人员职员采取歧视态度等。党公开了，但党的活动则大多不公开，不会把广大群众积极创造的精神与经验及时总结起来，使党员与群众发生隔阂，脱离群众，某些优秀分子怕入党后孤立。
    陈伯村同志最后着重指出今后如何提高党在生产中的作用：
    （一）加强企业中党对保证与监督完成生产计划的责任心与作用。刘少奇同志指示我们，保证监督就是“动员和组织群众来协助与保证该工厂计划之实施，并与阻碍这些计划实施的现象进行斗争。”也就是党的组织必须保证顺利完成国家给予该企业的任务，贯彻东北人民政府工业部王鹤寿部长报告中所提出的几个主要问题：即加强企业的经营管理，以减低成本提高质量，消灭生产中的浪费，加强全体职工的团结稳步进行基本建设，与培养后备力量。企业党必须把贯彻这些任务当作自己最大的责任。这些任务贯彻如何，就是今后衡量企业党的工作好坏的标准。
    根据工作做得比较好的工厂经验主要有如下四点：
    首先，工矿企业党支部以搞好生产为其基本任务，并将其贯彻到实际工作中，贯彻到支部活动的各个方面去，而不是停留在口头上与会议上。其次，党的组织不是空喊，不是泛泛研究生产，而是具体领导，具体分析情况，研究困难的与有利的条件，抓住关键所在，明确提出具体奋斗目标及实现这个目标必须解决的关键问题。然后通过各种组织与方法，党、行政、工会、青年团统一步调，贯彻到全党全厂；并继续深入检查，及时发现与克服新的困难与问题，培养典型，总结经验，教育干部，突破落后部门，使之贯彻实现。
    第三，党的工作是从思想领导方面，也即政治工作方面，用说服教育的方法来进行；而在进行上述工作时，是通过工会、青年团的党员，加强领导，联系广大群众。
    第四，工矿企业党的工作者必须熟悉工业，钻研生产学习技术，学习经营管理的知识，并与技术人员、职员、技术工人保持密切联系，发挥其积极性和创造精神。
    目前企业党的主要任务就是保证贯彻加强企业的经营管理。党应该仔细研究，提出党在贯彻此项主要任务的具体办法。党委、支部要具体研究一个工厂，一个车间如何降低成本，提高质量，贯彻经济核算制，在这方面存在什么问题，采取何种办法解决。在党员与先进工人中制订节省原材料，节省电力，减低废品率，生产价廉物美在市场易于出售的产品的具体计划，及时检查总结经验，随时协同行政纠正各种偏差等。
    企业党主动地积极地充分发挥其对生产的保证监督作用，是搞好党政关系的基本关键。因此，必须克服党的某些工作者消极的只是对行政不满而不主动的力求把生产搞好的偏向。
    （二）党必须善于领导群众。团结全体职工一起干。这就需要：
    教育党员学会做群众工作。通过党员自己的模范带头作用与对群众耐心的说服教育工作，提高群众的阶级觉悟，把党的政策决议变为全体职工自觉自愿的行动。为此，党的工作皆应公开进行。党的会议应经常邀请群众中的积极分子参加，克服和防止一切脱离群众的不良倾向。
    加强党对工会、青年团的领导，凡有关职工群众的一切生产、生活、学习等问题均须经由工会、青年团的党组和党员，通过工会和青年团的组织去进行。同时，党必须定期的经常讨论工会和青年团的工作，必须认识：加强了工会和青年团，也就是加强了党的工作，必须克服包办代替与不闻不问两种偏向。
    （三）改造企业党的领导作风，必须经常深入下级组织，深入生产过程，具体钻研：如何以政治工作的方法，协助行政办好工厂，从具体的经济活动中来体现党的政治领导，如何从检查与具体帮助下级组织的工作当中培养与提高新的骨干。这是目前加强企业党的作用中的一个关键问题；如果再是一般化的号召，空洞的指示而不钻研业务具体领导，则保证与监督的任务将无从实现。党委与总支应经常有重点有计划的深入到支部与现场，及时掌握生产中的各种实际情况，具体而准确地向下布置工作，提出真正切合实际需要的党如何保证生产的具体办法。（对于上级工业部门的各种政策命令指示等，党委与总支应经常主动积极地注意了解。为便于党组织研究如何保证生产的办法及时指示下级党协助贯彻，大企业部门的行政上每当接获上级的新到命令指示时，应首先向市委做报告。企业行政上有关生产的重要表报须按时发给市委，企业党委。）
    （四）巩固党的组织，慎重的发展党员。
    在整党期间暂不发展党员。在此时期着重检查工作，提高干部，教育党员，教育工人，进行重点的整顿。以巩固党的组织为今后继续发展准备条件。
    对新党员教育内容着重以下几个问题：
    第一、党员在工业生产中的责任，联系进行阶级教育及支援战争的教育，主人翁责任感的教育（完成国家的生产计划，就是党员在企业中的最基本的责任），提高其阶级觉悟。第二、党的政策。根据上级党的指示与上级行政的命令指示进行教育。目前着重贯彻经济核算（如提高质量，降低成本，节省原材料，爱护机器等），团结技术人员与团结全体工人阶级的政策。使党员自觉的遵守，并说服职工执行。第三、党联系群众与必须带领群众前进的道理与工作方法。
    在加强教育中对屡经教育不改，作风很坏，确实不够党员条件的人，要采用适当方法加以清洗，但开除党员要经支部大会讨论与市委大工矿党委批准。
    党的组织经过一个时期巩固后再慎重的采取严格审查的方针进行发展。
    目前我们东北工矿中党的数量已相当大，质量也比较好。如何充分发挥党的力量保证搞好企业，关键就在于各级党组织明确一切为了搞好生产的思想，迅速转变我们过去不够深入具体的领导作风，深入钻研，团结全体职工，为完成党与国家所给予的光荣任务而奋斗。
