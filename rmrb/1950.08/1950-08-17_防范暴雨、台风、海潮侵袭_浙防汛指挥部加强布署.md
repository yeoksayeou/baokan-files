To prevent rainstorms, typhoons, and tidal surges, the Zhejiang Flood Control Headquarters has strengthened its deployment.

[This Dispatch] The Zhejiang Flood Control Headquarters, anticipating the potential for rainstorms, typhoons, and high tides in the next three months, issued a notice to all regions on August 4th, urging them to heighten vigilance and strengthen flood control efforts. The instructions emphasized that the dikes that had been carefully led, thoroughly inspected, and where the masses had been mobilized to repair and defend, safely withstood the test of the heavy rains and floods of late July, thus ensuring the safety of autumn seedlings. Conversely, areas where complacency prevailed and flood control instructions were not implemented suffered flood damage and losses. To ensure the completion of this year's production tasks, flood control organizations at all levels must strive to ensure the safety of dikes. The following specific flood control points were also noted: (1) After a key inspection of dikes in areas such as the eastern Zhejiang seawall, the Cao'e River, the Pujiang River, and the eastern and western Tiaoxi Rivers, some dangerous sections should be thoroughly repaired and strengthened immediately. (2) Flood control organizations in all regions should complete in-depth inspections by mid-August. (3) To avoid mountain floods, mountain flood control work should be strengthened, field ridges should be repaired to protect terraced fields, and drainage methods should be improved. Additionally, sand dams should be built along mountain valleys and streams to mitigate mountain floods and intercept the sediment carried by mountain floods, in order to protect land and houses from being washed away and to reduce downstream flooding. (4) In coastal seawall areas and the Qiantang River seawall area, flood control organizations must promptly disseminate typhoon information and make preparations for emergency protection. After each tide or heavy rain, seawall projects should be immediately inspected, and any eroded or subsided sections should be repaired and reinforced promptly.

　　防范暴雨、台风、海潮侵袭
    浙防汛指挥部加强布署
    【本报讯】浙江防汛总指挥部，以今后三个月内随时可能有暴雨、台风和高潮的侵袭，特于八月四日通报各地，提高警惕，加强防汛工作。指示着重指出：经七月下旬暴雨山洪的考验，凡认真领导，切实检查，注意动员群众修防的堤防都安全度过，保障了秋苗；凡思想麻痹，没有贯彻执行防汛指示的地方，就遭受了水灾损失。为了保证今年生产任务的完成，各级防汛机构，必须努力争取保证堤防的安全。并指出下列防汛具体要点：（一）前经重点检查浙东海塘、曹娥江、浦阳江、东西苕溪等处堤防，尚有一些险工应即彻底培修加强。（二）各地防汛机构应于八月中旬完成深入大检查。（三）为避免山洪冲击，应加强山区防汛工作，培修田埂保护梯田，改善排水方法。并在沿山谷溪涧筑拦沙坝，缓和山洪，截留山洪带下的泥沙，以保护土地房屋不被冲毁，并减轻下游水灾。（四）沿海海塘及钱塘江海塘地区，防汛机构必须及时传达台风消息，并作抢护准备；每次潮汛或大雨后，立即检查海塘工程，凡被冲蚀、沉陷地段，应随时培修加固。
