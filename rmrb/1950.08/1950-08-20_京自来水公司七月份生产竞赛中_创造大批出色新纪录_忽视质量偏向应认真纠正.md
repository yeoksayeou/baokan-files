[Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch] During the July production competition, employees of all departments of the Beijing Tap Water Company achieved many outstanding new records, resulting in exceeding the overall production target and reducing water costs. However, some units developed shortcomings of only focusing on quantity and neglecting quality during the competition, which must be seriously overcome.

The creation of new records was initiated by the employees of the Water Supply Section. The First Team of the Construction Unit took the lead in challenging, guaranteeing to complete the task of modifying water pipes for 60 users in July ten days ahead of schedule. As a result, they completed it eleven days ahead of schedule and exceeded the task by six users. The Second Team responded to the competition. Their original July task was to replace 750 water meters. They proposed to replace 200 more, and eventually replaced 1,020, exceeding the task by 270. Subsequently, the Water Meter Section also launched a competition. By improving labor organization and implementing a specialized responsibility system for repairing water meters, the average work efficiency of each person increased by 35 percent, ensuring that water meters sent in on the same day were repaired and no work was backlogged. Afterward, water plants, the Business Section, the Accounting Section, and other departments enthusiastically launched competitions and also created many new records. The Water Plant Repair Team improved operational methods and created a new record for dismantling and repairing water well motors, saving 60 percent of labor in dismantling the old Xingbu Street water well. In order to ensure water quality, the Water Plant Laboratory increased the number of bacteria inspections by eight times and the number of residual chlorine tests by six times. The Revenue Collection Team of the Business Section proposed the slogan of eliminating bad debts and ensuring that more than 90 percent of the monthly water bills were collected. As a result, 94.82 percent of water bills were collected, which was unprecedented for the Tap Water Company. At the same time, employees of various departments also put forward many rationalization proposals, totaling 22 in July. For example, Sun Qingcheng, the foreman of the overhaul team of the water source group of the Dongzhimen Water Plant, created a "triangular steady-mounted micrometer," which is very precise, providing a basis for installing vertical motor bearings and extending the life of the motor. Sun Jikun of the electrical overhaul team of the Dongzhimen Water Plant improved the single-phase circuit breaker to a three-phase circuit breaker, eliminating the danger of damaging the motor due to line problems. The two creations and improvements made great contributions. With these new records and technological improvements, the production tasks in July were mostly overfulfilled. The main ones were that the original plan for expanding pipelines was 2,710 meters, but the actual expansion exceeded it by 95.3 percent. The original plan for expanding users was 460 households, but the actual expansion exceeded it by 29.5 percent. The target for reducing water loss rate in July was to reduce it to 20.5 percent, but it was reduced to 17.5 percent. The electricity cost of water was also greatly reduced, from 0.417 kWh per ton of water in June to 0.355 kWh.

Although the above achievements were made in the competition, due to the leadership's failure to delve into the masses, promptly grasp the situation, check the work, and correct deviations, and the lack of established clear specifications and standards, the workers only strived to increase the quantity of work and ignored the improvement of quality, resulting in a serious waste of manpower and materials. The Sand Casting Team of the Repair and Casting Plant cast 325 twelve-inch water pipes, but the dimensions of the bell and spigot ends did not meet the specifications, and the sizes were inconsistent. There was no gap left for the lead joint, and the spigot end was larger than the bell end. When the water pipes were sent to the construction site, the workers of the Construction Unit could not use them. This not only affected the progress of the project, but also required 240 more workdays to re-process and modify this batch of materials before they could be used. Adding the consumption of round-trip transportation, a total of 4,000 catties of millet were wasted. The overhaul team of the Dongzhimen Water Plant did not thoroughly overhaul Well No. 3, resulting in rework. When the Repair Team installed the vertical machine frame for Well No. 9 at the Andingmen Water Plant, they damaged the frame due to negligence in their work. The company should seize the opportunity to summarize the experiences and lessons learned from these shortcomings and seriously correct them.

### 京自来水公司七月份生产竞赛中  创造大批出色新纪录  忽视质量偏向应认真纠正

　　京自来水公司七月份生产竞赛中
    创造大批出色新纪录
    忽视质量偏向应认真纠正
    【京市新闻处讯】京市自来水公司各部门职工在七月份生产竞赛中出现了许多出色的新纪录，使总的生产任务超额完成，水的成本降低；但在竞赛运动中个别单位发生了只顾数量、忽视质量的缺点，须要认真克服。
    创造新纪录是由供水课职工带动起来的。该课施工股第一班首先挑战，保证把七月份改装用户水管六十处的任务提前十天完成，结果提前十一天完成，还超过六处。第二班响应竞赛，七月份任务原是换水表七五○具，他们提出多换二○○具，结果换了一○二○具，多换了二百七十具。接着，水表股也展开竞赛，由于改进劳动组织，修水表实行专责制，每人工作效率平均提高百分之三十五，做到了当日送来的水表当日修齐，不积压工作。随后，水厂、业务课、会计课等都热烈展开竞赛，也创造了不少新纪录。水厂检修组改进操作方法，创造拆修水井电机新纪录，拆旧刑部街的水井节省人工百分之六十。水厂化验室为使水质清洁，把细菌检查次数提高八倍，把剩余氯检验次数提高六倍。业务课收费股提出消灭呆帐，保证当月水费收到百分之九十以上的口号，结果水费收到百分之九四·八二，是自来水公司从来没有的现象。同时，各部门职工还提出很多合理化建议，七月份里共有二十二件。如东直门水厂水源组中修班领班孙庆成，创造“三角稳装千分尺”，非常精确，使装立式电机轴承有了依据，延长电机寿命；东直门水厂电气中修班孙集锟改进单相跳闸器为三相跳闸器，消灭了因线路出毛病以致损毁电机的危险。两项创造改进贡献很大。有了这些新纪录和技术改进，七月份的生产任务绝大部分超额完成。主要的如扩充管线原计划是二七一○米，结果超额百分之九五·三，扩充用户原计划是四六○户，结果超额百分之二九·五。减少水的损失率七月份原订目标是要减少到百分之二○·五，结果降低到百分之十七·五；水的用电成本也大为降低，由六月份每吨水用电○·四一七度降低到○·三五五度。
    在竞赛中虽然有了上面的成绩，但由于领导上未深入群众、及时掌握情况，检查工作，纠正偏向，加以没有建立明确规格标准，工人们只争取工作数量的增多，忽视了质量的提高，造成严重的人力物力浪费。修铸厂翻砂组铸十二英寸水管三百二十五根，承口和插口尺寸不合乎规格，大小也不一致，没有留铅口的间隙，发生插口大于承口的现象，把水管送到工地里，施工股工人不能使用，不仅影响了工程的进展，这批材料且须再以二百四十个工加工改修才能使用，加上往返运输的消耗，共浪费达四千斤小米。东直门水厂中修班检修三号井不够彻底，结果反工。检修组在安定门水厂装九号井立式机管架时，由于工作疏忽，把管架损毁。对于这些缺点，该公司应抓紧总结经验教训，认真纠正。
