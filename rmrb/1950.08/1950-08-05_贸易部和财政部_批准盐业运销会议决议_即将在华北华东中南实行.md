Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: The resolution passed by the Salt Transportation and Sales Conference held in Beijing in mid-June has been approved by the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government. The resolution will be jointly observed and implemented by both public and private sectors engaged in the salt industry in the North China, East China, and Central-South China regions, under the supervision and guidance of the industrial and commercial administrative departments.

The resolution, based on the policy of state-owned economy leading, with both public and private sectors engaged in transportation and sales, and the principle of planned transportation and sales, makes clear provisions for various related issues in the public and private salt industry operations. The resolution points out that the main consumers of edible salt are the broad masses of farmers, therefore it must be promoted in rural areas; at the same time, costs must be reduced. To avoid blind transportation and sales, the resolution stipulates that salt transportation and sales merchants must prepare quarterly and monthly transportation and sales plans, which will be implemented after being approved by the China Salt Industry Corporation. If they feel that the reported plan is insufficient, they should submit a supplementary plan immediately. After salt merchants transport salt to the sales area, they are free to go to the countryside to promote sales. However, when transporting from one key point to another within the province, it must be approved by the branch of the China Salt Industry Corporation to avoid affecting the entire transportation and sales plan. The standard for key points is locations that are hubs of material exchange and important land and water transportation routes, which are jointly determined by the salt branch and the salt merchants' association. In order to adjust supply and demand and stabilize salt prices, the resolution stipulates that the existing consignment shops of the salt company should be adjusted, and those that are excessive should be cancelled; those that need to be set up should be appropriately established. Consignment shops must comply with the prescribed rules and regulations. In order to solve the source of salt for distributors, reduce the burden on consumers, and enable distributors to obtain reasonable profits and take care of their financial difficulties, the resolution stipulates that existing distributors in ten cities, including Tianjin, Jinan, Bengbu, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Hankou, Changsha, and Guangzhou, can jointly report for transportation, but they must prepare a plan and guarantee its implementation.

Regarding the issue of salt prices, the resolution clearly stipulates that the China Salt Industry Corporation grasps the principle of salt prices, which is to take care of the legitimate interests of production, consumption, and transportation; and to adjust market supply and demand and stabilize prices through price policies. Both the public and private sectors should work together to stabilize salt prices. The resolution points out that the determination of listed prices for edible salt in various places should have reasonable price differences; the listed prices between the various salt branches should maintain an appropriate distance to adapt to the law of circulation and facilitate transportation and sales. The China Salt Industry Corporation should control the listed prices, lead private merchants, and jointly implement them. In order to make retail merchants profitable, a reasonable margin must be maintained between wholesale and retail prices.

The resolution also decided that public and private salt management units in various places should jointly form a salt price research committee of a consultative nature, under the leadership of the local industrial and commercial administrative departments, to study and improve management methods and develop the salt industry's transportation and sales business. Salt companies in various places should join the local salt merchants' association, so that public and private sectors can better cooperate and jointly and correctly implement policies.

　　贸易部和财政部
    批准盐业运销会议决议
    即将在华北华东中南实行
    【新华社三日讯】六月中旬在北京召开的盐业运销会议通过的决议，已经中央人民政府贸易部和财政部批准。该项决议即将在华北、华东、中南三地区的工商行政部门的监督和指导下，由经营盐业的公私双方共同遵守执行。
    决议根据以国营经济为领导、公私兼运兼销的政策和有计划地运销的原则，对公私盐业经营中的各项有关问题都作出了明确的规定。决议指出：食盐的主要消费者是广大农民，因此必须向农村推销；同时必须减低成本。为避免盲目运销，决议规定盐业运销商人须按季分月编造运销计划，经中国盐业公司批准后执行。如感已报计划不足，应即另送补充计划。运商运盐到达销地后，可以自由下乡推销。但在省内由一个重点分运至另一个重点时，须经中国盐业公司分公司批准，以免影响整个运销计划。重点的标准是物资交流、水陆交通要道的地点，由盐业分公司和盐商公会共同协商确定。为了调剂供求、稳定盐价，决议规定盐业公司对现有代销店应加以调整，过多的应撤销；必要设置的应适当设置。代销店必须遵守规定的章则制度。为解决销商盐源，减轻消费者的负担，并使销商得到合理利润，照顾其资力的困难，决议规定在天津、济南、蚌埠、南京、上海、杭州、南昌、汉口、长沙、广州等十个城市的现有销商，可以联合报运，但须编造计划，保证执行。
    关于盐价问题，决议明确规定中国盐业公司掌握盐价的原则，是照顾生产、消费和贩运三者的正当利益；并通过价格政策，调剂市场供求，稳定物价。公私双方对于盐价的稳定应共同努力。决议指出，各地食盐牌价的核定应有合理差价；各盐业分公司间的牌价应保持适当距离，以适应流转规律，畅通运销。中国盐业公司应掌握牌价，领导私商，共同执行。为使零售商有利可图，批发与零售价格之间必须保持合理差额。
    决议并决定由各地公私盐业经营单位合组咨议性质的盐价研究委员会，在当地工商行政部门领导下，研究改进经营办法，发展盐业运销业务。各地盐业公司应加入当地盐商公会，使公私之间得以更好地合作，共同正确执行政策。
