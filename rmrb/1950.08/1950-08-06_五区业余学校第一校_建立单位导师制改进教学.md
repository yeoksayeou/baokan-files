　　The First Fifth District Spare-time School
    Establishes a Unit Tutor System to Improve Teaching

    [Our Newspaper] Since the First Fifth District Spare-time School in Beijing established a unit tutor system, it has achieved good results in teaching. The school opened in early April. In order to provide learning guidance, class teachers were set up according to the Chinese language classes, and the task of the class teachers was to contact students and help them with make-up lessons. Because spare-time school students have little time for activities at school, class teachers have few opportunities to contact students at school. Moreover, each class has students from various units, and a full-time teacher serves as the class teacher for three classes, having to run to dozens of units to contact students, making it difficult to take care of everything. Therefore, for six weeks after the start of classes, the work had not been carried out very well, and even most of the students did not know who their class teacher was. The full-time teacher meeting on May 13 summarized this experience and decided to temporarily suspend the activities of class teachers and switch to a unit tutor system, that is, depending on the number of students in each factory or organization, a full-time teacher would be assigned to serve as the unit tutor for one or several units. The duties of the unit tutor are: 1. Understand the characteristics and business nature of each unit, frequently contact the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League in the unit, listen to their opinions, and obtain their assistance. 2. Understand the students' work, study, and ideological situation, investigate the reasons for absences, and organize students to make up lessons. 3. Assist the academic affairs office in establishing various systems and promoting academic work.

    Initially, some teachers thought they were too busy with their work, had no experience in mass work, and could not find problems when going to the units, which would be a waste of time; others thought that their political level was low and were afraid of dealing with cadres. Wang Shuli, a middle-level Chinese teacher, was already busy with her work, and frowned at the mention of going to the units, but after a trip to the court, she excitedly told her colleagues: "This trip, the student comrades gave me a lot of suggestions, which are very comprehensive! How could I know without going!" Because she went deep into the masses to listen to the students' reflections and further understood the students' requirements, she improved her teaching methods. Whether going to factories or organizations, the students always warmly welcomed and entertained the teachers. In this way, the teachers' concerns were eliminated, and they became interested in going to the units. Several teachers also learned how to conduct investigation and research work.

    After the implementation of the unit tutor system, it first assisted various units in establishing mutual aid groups and establishing attendance and leave systems, basically eliminating absenteeism (the average number of absences in April accounted for 30% of the total number of classes, which was reduced to 7% in July); it reduced absenteeism (more than 30 of the 42 units in the school reduced the number of absences by 5% to 15%, and individual units even reduced it by 60% to 70%). It also assisted units with more than ten students in establishing a make-up lesson system, solving the make-up lesson problem for 650 students, accounting for 87% of the total number of students in the school. Unit tutors played a significant role in the end-of-term review campaign, mobilizing for the final exam, and assisting the academic affairs office in arranging holiday work. Because the teachers often went down to the units, they prompted units that did not pay much attention to cadres' cultural learning to pay attention to it. For example, Comrade Zhou Ming, secretary of the detention center of the court, said: "We didn't pay close attention to it before, but you often come to urge us, so we can't help but pay attention to it." The average absenteeism rate in the institute was 30% in April and May, but it has now been completely eliminated. Because there is a sound make-up lesson system, more than 50 of the 71 students in the institute achieved a grade of A in the final exam. In the past, the Bureau of Commerce had an absenteeism rate of 70%. After the unit tutor went down, Comrade Cheng Xiuwu, the chief of the personnel section, immediately convened a student meeting to resolve the contradiction between work and study, and then personally controlled the leave system, so that the number of absences in the eleventh week was reduced to 0.7%.

　　五区业余学校第一校
    建立单位导师制改进教学
    【本报讯】京市第五区业余学校第一校建立单位导师制以来，在教学方面已获得良好成绩。该校于四月上旬开学。为了辅导学习，曾按国语班次设立了班主任，规定班主任的任务是联系学员并帮助学员补课。因为业余学校学员在校活动的时间少，所以班主任在校很少机会联系学员。而每一班之中，各单位的学员都有，一个专任教员担任三班班主任，要跑几十个单位去联系学员，也不易照顾全面。因此，开课后六周，工作一直没有很好地开展，甚至有大部分学员还不知道谁是他们的班主任。五月十三日的专任教员会议总结了这个经验，决定暂时停止班主任的活动，改行单位导师制，即视各工厂、机关、学员的多少，规定一位专任教员，担任一个或数个单位的单位导师。并规定单位导师的工作为：一、了解各单位的特点和业务性质，经常联系该单位的党、政、工、团，听取他们的意见，取得他们的帮助。二、了解学员的工作、学习和思想情况，调查缺课原因，并组织学员补课。三、协助教务处建立各种制度和推动教务工作。
    起初，有些教员认为业务太忙，又没有做过群众工作，下单位不能发现问题，白耽搁时间；有的认为自己政治水平低，害怕和干部打交道。中级国文教员王淑丽工作本来忙，一提下单位就蹙起了眉头，但去了法院一趟回来以后，就兴高采烈地找同志说：“这一去，学员同志们给我提了很多意见，都很全面呀！不去那能知道！”因为深入群众听取了学员的反映，进一步了解了学员的要求，她改进了教学方法。无论去工厂或是机关，学员们总是热情地欢迎和招待老师。这样，教员的顾虑消除了，对下单位发生了兴趣。有好几个教师还学会了作调查研究工作。
    单位导师制实行以后，首先协助各单位成立互助小组和建立考勤、请假制度，基本上消灭了旷课现象（四月份旷课次数平均每天占上课总次数的百分之三十，七月份减至百分之七）；减少了缺课现象（全校四十二个单位有三十多个单位的缺课次数减少了百分之五到十五，个别单位还减少了百分之六、七十）。并协助十个学员以上的单位将补课制度建立起来，解决了六百五十个学员的补课问题，占全校学员总数的百分之八十七。期末的温课运动、动员期考和协助教务处布置假期工作，单位导师都起了很大的作用。由于教员时常下去，促使本来不很重视干部文化学习的单位也重视起来了。如法院看守所秘书周明同志说：“以前我们抓得不紧，你们经常来催，不重视不行了。”该所四、五月份旷课人数平均有百分之三十，现已完全消灭了。因为有了健全的补课制度，所以该所七十一名学员中，期考成绩在甲等的有五十人以上。商业局过去缺课学员达百分之七十。单位导师下去以后，人事科长程修武同志随即召开学员大会，解决了工作与学习的矛盾，此后并亲自掌握请假制度，使第十一周缺课人数减到百分之○·七。
