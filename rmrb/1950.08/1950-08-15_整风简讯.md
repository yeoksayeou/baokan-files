　　Rectification Briefs

　　The rectification study of the direct organs of the Xingtai Prefectural Committee of the CPC in Hebei Province, from July 10th to the end of July, a total of twenty days, has completed the study of documents according to the planned schedule. Based on the spirit of the documents, it has also combined this with the examination, analysis, and criticism of the work in this region and department. As a result, many departments have found the focus of their rectification. The Prefectural Committee's Propaganda Department, because it did not understand the situation at the lower levels, requested twelve types of investigation materials from lower levels at once when writing work summaries. Schools such as Xingtai Normal School and Xingtai Middle School will rectify their subjectivist teaching methods that are divorced from the masses (students), and the People's Eye Hospital will rectify their poor attitude towards patients, etc.

　　In preparation for rectification, the Dezhou Prefectural Committee of the CPC in Shandong Province drew thirty-one cadres from various departments of the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office to form five work inspection teams. Led by responsible comrades of the Prefectural Committee, they went to De County, Qihe, LinYi, Yucheng, Nanpi and other counties on July 24 to inspect the work of each county. The main focus was on inspecting the progress of summer work (summer production, summer flood prevention, etc.) and people's representative conferences, as well as problems in general leadership work.

　　In preparation for rectification, the Propaganda Department of the Meng County Committee of the CPC in Shanxi Province inspected the implementation of notices and instructions issued from March to July over a four-month period. In the four months, a total of seventeen notices and instructions were issued to the district committees, but very little was known about their implementation. For example, after the issuance of instructions on district-level cadre study in April, the County Committee only knew some of the situation from reports from below, which was very incomplete. Naturally, there was no way to strengthen leadership over these tasks. After such an inspection, even the education cadre discovered serious bureaucratic work styles in their own work. Therefore, they have asked to participate in the rectification study at the Yuci Prefectural Committee.

　　整风简讯
    中共河北邢台地委直属机关整风学习，从七月十日至七月底的二十天中，已按预定计划学完文件，并根据文件精神结合检查与分析批判了本地区本部门的工作。许多部门因此找到了自己整风的重点。地委宣传部因为对下层情况不了解，写工作总结时，一次就和下级要十二种调查材料。邢师、邢中等学校将整脱离群众（学生）的主观主义教学方法，人民眼科医院将整对待病号的不良态度等。

    中共山东德州地委为准备整风，地委、专署各部门抽调干部三十一人，组成五个工作检查组，由地委负责同志亲自带领于七月二十四日分赴德县、齐河、临邑、禹城、南皮等县检查各县工作。主要是检查夏季工作（夏季生产、夏防等）和人民代表会议等工作的进行情形，及一般领导工作中的问题。

    中共山西省盂县县委宣传部为准备整风，曾在七月间检查了从三月到七月四个月来所发通知和指示的执行情形。四个月来共发给区委通知、指示十七件，但对执行情形了解得很少。例如四月间发出关于区级干部学习的指示后，县委只从下边的报告里知道一些情况，很不全面。自然谈不到加强对这些工作的领导了。经过这样检查后，连教育干事也发现了自己工作中存在着严重的官僚主义作风。因此他们纷纷要求到榆次地委参加整风学习。
