　　(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 27th) A frontline reporter from this agency in Korea reports: The superiority of the U.S. Air Force is merely in numbers. In quality, combat skills, and morale, the pilots of the Korean People's Air Force surpass them.

　　A 21-year-old fighter pilot of the Korean People's Air Force told the reporter: "When the enemy outnumbers us, we are not afraid to engage them even at a ratio of one to ten. They run away as soon as they encounter difficulties. As for their jet planes, we are very willing to engage them." This pilot is Major Li Dongkui, who has been awarded the title of "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." Since the beginning of the war, he has flown fifty sorties, shot down nine enemy aircraft in air combat, and destroyed one enemy aircraft on the ground; including two B-29 bombers and three jet aircraft. He said, "These jet planes fly very fast, but what they like to do is to sneak in a burst of fire and then run. With skill, it is possible to defeat them. We heard a lot about the speed of American jet planes, and I didn't know what to do before I first encountered them. But after shooting down one of them for the first time, I was very confident that I could deal with these planes."

　　Major Li Dongkui told the reporter in detail about an air combat. That air combat occurred when Major Li Dongkui and another combat partner were covering armored vehicles moving south. Two American jet planes flew over Wuzhiyuan and fired at the two Korean planes, but missed. The American planes immediately turned to attack again, and Li followed suit. Although the jet planes were fast, he finally aimed and hit one. He saw the plane's tail smoking and falling straight down, and then began to chase the other one.

　　At this time, he looked back and saw two more jet planes tailing him, while his own partner was tailing them. He straightened his plane up, then turned behind the enemy planes, and flew level with his partner. At this time, the three American jet planes quickly fled.

　　That same afternoon, he saw an American Mustang plane performing this aircraft's favorite maneuver, flying close to the mountainside and strafing when there was a safe opportunity. He dived to chase, and the enemy plane began to fly low along the valley, close to the ground. When he chased it to an open space, he dived down and shot down the Mustang.

　　Li Dongkui had just rejoined his partner when he immediately discovered four more American jet fighters coming from behind. At that time, two B-29s, under the cover of jet planes, were attempting to bomb a Korean transport convoy. Li and his comrade quickly turned and flew to the sides of these jet planes, and the jet planes fled at full speed.

　　They had just resumed straight flight when they spotted a propeller-driven fighter plane flying towards them, and they swooped down together and shot it down.

　　Li Dongkui said: "B-29 planes are not difficult to shoot down, as long as you attack quickly and decisively, and aim to shoot between the wings."

　　Major Li is a member of the Korean Workers' Party and a member of the Youth League. He used to be a carpenter and only has one year of flying experience. Meanwhile, the captured American pilots here have four or more years of experience.

　　The reporter also met Lieutenant Colonel Jin Jiyu, who was also awarded the title of "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." His record is ten enemy aircraft shot down. Lieutenant Colonel Jin is 26 years old this year. He first encountered enemy aircraft on June 26, when he was ordered to attack enemy troops gathered at Seoul Station. Although there were many enemy fighters, he resolutely carried out the attack, causing many trains carrying military equipment preparing to attack the north to burn and explode. He said, "After the first encounter with enemy aircraft, I was very confident. Courage and skill can defeat them every time. I have been working hard to hone my skills and come up with various maneuvers. The more courageous and flexible your maneuvers, the more afraid the American pilots become. If they see that you are truly determined, they will not dare to tangle with you and will run away immediately."

　　In the air, as on the ground, the Korean Air Force surpasses the U.S. Air Force in quality, combat skills, and morale. When faced with these air warriors who know they are fighting for their country's freedom, the Americans' reliance on machines completely fails.

　　朝鲜人民共和国英雄
    空军李东奎少校和金基玉中校
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】本社朝鲜前伐记者报道：美国空军的优势只是数量上的优势，在质量、作战技能及士气上，朝鲜人民空军的驾驶员都超过了他们。
    朝鲜人民空军一位二十一岁的战斗机驾驶员告记者说：“当敌众我寡的时候，我们以一对十也不怕和他们周旋。他们一有困难就逃跑。至于他们的喷气式飞机，我们很愿意和它们交锋。”这位驾驶员是荣获“朝鲜人民共和国英雄”的李东奎少校。他自战争开始以来已飞行五十次，在空战中击落敌机九架，另击毁地上敌机一架；其中包括两架Ｂ——二十九型轰炸机和三架喷气式飞机。他说，“这些喷气式机飞行很快，但它们所喜欢做的是偷偷地打一排枪就跑。用技巧是能够击败它们的。我们听到很多关于美国喷气式机的速度的说法，我在初次与它们交锋前，不知道怎么好。但在第一次击落其中的一架以后，我就很有信心能对付这些飞机。”
    李东奎少校详细地把一次空战的情形告诉记者。那次空战是在李东奎少校与另一战斗伙伴掩护装甲车南进的时候。在乌致院上空飞来两架美国喷气式机，对两架朝鲜飞机射击，但未命中。美机立即回旋以便再行攻击，李即随之回旋，喷气机速度虽快，但他终于瞄准而击中一架。他看到该机尾部冒烟直坠而下，便开始追逐另一架。
    这时，他回头看到另外两架喷气机尾追自己，而他自己的伙伴又尾追着它们，便将飞机笔直上升，然后回旋到敌机后面，与自己的伙伴平飞。这时，三架美国喷气式机便迅速逃跑了。
    同日下午，他看到一架美国野马式机正施行这种飞机的得意操作，即紧靠山头而飞，并在有安全机会时进行扫射。他便俯冲追逐，敌机即开始沿山谷紧靠地面低飞。当追到有开阔的空间时，他便俯冲下来，把野马式机击落。
    李东奎刚与他的伙伴再度会合，立即发现后面又来了四架美国喷气式战斗机。那时，有两架Ｂ—二十九型机在喷气式机掩护下企图轰炸朝鲜的运输队。李即同友机急遽转弯，飞到这些喷气式机的两侧，喷气式机就开足速度逃走了。
    他们刚刚再度直飞，又发现一架螺旋推进的战斗机飞来，就一同飞扑上去把它击落。
    李东奎说：“Ｂ—二十九型飞机是不难打下的，只要你迅速坚决进行攻击，并瞄准两翼中间射击。”
    李少校是朝鲜劳动党党员，又是青年团员，从前是木匠，只有一年的飞行经验。而此间俘虏的美军飞行员有四年或四年以上的经验。
    记者也会见了另一位荣获“朝鲜人民共和国英雄”称号的金基玉中校。他的纪录是击落敌机十架。金中校今年二十六岁，他在六月二十六日奉令攻击集结于汉城车站的敌军时，初次与敌机交锋。虽然有许多敌方战斗机，他仍坚决进行袭击，使载有军事装备的准备进攻北方的许多列车燃烧、爆炸。他说，“在与敌机初次交锋后，我很有信心。勇敢及技能每次都能把它们击败。我一直在努力熟练我的技巧，想出各种操纵办法。你的操纵办法越勇敢灵活，美国飞行员就越害怕。如果他们看到你真正有决心，他们就不敢与你纠缠而马上逃跑了。”
    在空中和在陆地一样，朝鲜空军在质量、作战技能以及士气方面是胜过美国空军的。当遇到这些知道他们是为本国的自由而战的空中勇士时，美国人对机器的依赖就完全失败了。
