Xinhua News Agency and Pingyuan Daily reported: After overcoming the spring famine, disaster areas in Shandong and Pingyuan provinces continued to launch summer production and famine relief work. Although Shandong and Pingyuan provinces successfully overcame the spring famine after the summer harvest, the disaster victims' families were too poor, and they suffered from new disasters such as floods, wind, hail, and insects this spring, resulting in a summer famine in both provinces.

According to current estimates, Shandong Province has 4 million grain-deficient disaster victims (7 million during the spring famine). Sixty percent of the disaster victims can achieve self-salvation through organized production and social mutual assistance, but 1.5 million people still have no means of subsistence. Currently, 44 counties in Pingyuan are experiencing summer famine, with approximately 1.2 million disaster victims. Except for a small number of disaster victims in lightly affected areas who still have some grain, the entire disaster area in the province is short of approximately 57.51 million jin of grain before the autumn harvest. For these two provinces, overcoming the summer famine is still a serious struggle task.

After the wheat harvest, many district and township cadres have a sense of complacency that "they can breathe a sigh of relief" and are relatively lax in their leadership of disaster relief. Many disaster victims also have the idea of "having suffered hunger all spring, they must eat for two days." In response to this, the provincial governments of the two provinces issued instructions, educating cadres and the masses of disaster victims to overcome complacency and clearly recognize the seriousness of the summer famine. They also organized mobile inspection teams to go to various places to supervise and inspect. Pingyuan has decided that heavy disaster areas should focus on production for disaster relief, closely integrating agricultural and sideline production, and strengthening the leadership of disaster relief committees at all levels. At the same time, each special district and county should formulate comprehensive disaster relief plans based on actual conditions, so as to quickly launch the province's disaster relief and prevention work. The Shandong Provincial Government put forward the slogan of "Grasp summer production, provide disaster relief when there are disasters, and prepare for famine when there are no disasters." Yishui Special District has mobilized counties and districts to compare production and savings, and promote collective efforts by disaster victims to survive the famine. Rongcheng, Zhaoyuan, Rushan and other counties have comprehensively launched summer famine relief work through people's representative conferences at all levels. The Shandong Provincial Government has distributed 8,866,600 jin of relief grain to grain-deficient disaster victims. The Provincial Cooperative has decided to use 60% of its funds to support sideline production by disaster victims, including supplying raw materials and marketing finished products. Currently, nearly 800,000 disaster victims in the province have re-entered sideline and household handicraft production. The Provincial Grain Company has also invested 85 million jin of coarse grains in disaster areas in exchange for wheat, in order to stabilize wheat prices in disaster areas and help disaster victims survive the famine.

　　山东平原两省
    展开夏季度荒工作
    克服麻痹思想深入督促检查
    【本报讯】据新华社及平原日报讯：山东、平原两省灾区在战胜春荒以后，又继续展开了夏季生产度荒工作。山东、平原两省在夏收后虽已胜利度过春荒，但因灾民家底太空，又加以今春连遭水、风、雹、虫等新的灾害，以致形成了两省的夏荒。
    据目前估计：山东全省缺粮灾民有四百万人（春荒时有七百万），其中百分之六十的灾民经过组织生产、社会互济后可获自救外，尚有一百五十万人生活无着。平原目前有四十四县发生夏荒，灾民约一百二十万人，除一部分轻灾区灾民尚有部分粮食外，全省灾区在秋收前共缺粮约五千七百五十一万余斤。该两省目前对克服夏荒工作，仍是一个严重的斗争任务。
    麦收后，不少区、乡干部都存在着“可以松一口气了”的麻痹思想，对救灾领导也比较松懈；而不少的灾民也有“挨了一春饿，说什么也要吃两天”的想法。该两省省府针对这一点，均曾发出指示，教育干部与灾民群众，必须克服麻痹思想，明确认识到夏荒的严重性。并组织巡回视查组分赴各地督促检查。平原已决定重灾区均以生产救灾为中心，使农业与副业生产密切结合，并加强各级救灾委员会的领导。同时要各专、县根据实际情况订出全面救灾计划，以便迅速展开全省的救灾防灾工作。山东省府提出“掌握夏季生产，有灾救灾，无灾备荒”的号召。沂水专区已发动各县、区比生产、比节约，推动灾民集体打谱度荒。荣城、招远、乳山等县通过各界人民代表会，已全面展开了夏季度荒工作。山东省府已将八百八十六万六千斤救济粮发给缺粮灾民；省合作社决定将百分之六十的资金用于扶助灾民的副业生产，包括供给原料和推销成品。目前全省再度投入副业和家庭手工业生产的灾民已近八十万人。省粮食公司亦以八千五百万斤粗粮投入灾区换小麦，借以稳定灾区麦价，并扶助灾民度荒。
