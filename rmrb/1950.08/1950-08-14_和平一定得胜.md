　　Peace Must Triumph
    Soviet Artist Yefimov
    In 1945 and 1946, when the major German war criminals were being tried in Nuremberg, Germany, I went to the court to observe.
    The fascist bandits launched a bloody war in Europe, sacrificing millions of human lives. In court, the heinous crimes of the fascist bandits were revealed to the world with renewed force every day.
    In February 1946, while the Nuremberg trials were still underway and people around the world were still condemning the crimes committed by the major German war criminals, one of the main instigators of world war, Churchill, delivered a provocative speech in Fulton, USA, calling for new imperialist wars. At that time, we—Soviet artists and writers—who were observing the Nuremberg trials, felt that we would probably be attending another trial in the future, one in which the new instigators of new bloody wars of imperialism would be judged.
    I, a Soviet artist, like all Soviet people, signed my name to the World Peace Congress Standing Committee's appeal to ban atomic weapons, to express my firm belief. At the same time, in many countries around the world, millions of good people signed this appeal, expressing their determination to actively fight for world peace. I believe that humanity will shatter the plans of the instigators of a third world war. Unity and universal enthusiasm are the guarantee of this. The Soviet people support the proposal for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the struggle for peace with unanimous universal enthusiasm. The Soviet people, led by their great leader Stalin, have always been, and still are, the vanguard of all mankind in the struggle to defend peace. The forces of peace are stronger and more powerful than the forces of war. Peace must triumph!

　　和平一定得胜
    苏联画家  叶菲莫夫
    一九四五年到一九四六年，在德国纽伦堡审判德国主要战犯的时候，我曾经到法院观审。
    法西斯匪帮挑起了欧洲流血大战，牺牲了人类数百万的生命。在法庭上每天都以新的力量向全世界揭露出法西斯匪帮的万恶罪行。
    一九四六年二月，当纽伦堡还在继续审讯，世界各国人民还在审判德国主要战犯所干的罪行的时候，世界战争主要挑拨者之一——邱吉尔在美国福尔敦城发出了挑战性的演说，号召新的帝国主义战争。当时在纽伦堡法庭观审的我们——苏联艺术工作者——画家和作家，就感觉到：大概我们将来还会旁听另一次审判案，在那一次可要审判帝国主义新的血腥战争的新挑拨者了。
    我，一个苏联画家，和全体苏联人民一样，在世界保卫和平大会常设委员会要求禁止原子武器呼吁书上签上了自己的名字，以表示坚强的信念。同时在世界许多国家内，数以百万计的善良的人们，都在这个呼吁书上签了名，以表示自己积极为全世界和平而奋斗的决心。我相信人类将会粉碎第三次世界大战挑拨者的计划。团结一致和普遍热情就是这件事的保证。苏联人以一致的普遍的热情来支持关于禁止原子武器，关于争取和平的斗争的建议。苏联人民以自己伟大领袖斯大林为首，一向是，现在也是为保卫和平而奋斗的全人类的先锋。和平的力量比战争力量更强大，更雄厚。和平一定得胜！
