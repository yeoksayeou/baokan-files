　　The Destruction of the "Atomic Heroes"
　　By Our Special Correspondent in the Korean Battlefield, Li Zhuang
　　The U.S. invading army's 24th Division has been completely wiped out in Korea. Of the 18,000 Americans, some were fortunate enough to become prisoners of the Korean People's Army, while most defiled the Korean soil with their own foul blood. These "Atomic Heroes" landed in Busan on July 1st and were finally annihilated in Daejeon on July 20th, a total of twenty days. The American prisoners said very dejectedly, "Twenty—it's an ominous number for us."
　　The Americans look down on the Syngman Rhee puppet army. They say that the reason for the failures in the battles of Suwon, Pyeongtaek, Cheonan, and Osan (all on the Seoul-Daejeon railway line) was mainly that the puppet army did not fight well. Therefore, they drove away the remaining puppet army and became the main force in the Battle of Daejeon. Daejeon is bordered to the north by the Geum River, which is more than 500 meters wide. Between the river and the city is a series of highlands. The Americans built more than a hundred artillery emplacements on the highlands and placed more than a hundred tanks in front of the emplacements. In their own view, this was foolproof. On July 15, the People's Army forcibly crossed the Geum River in broad daylight, using the giant cannons on the tanks to destroy the American artillery emplacements, and surrounded Daejeon from three sides. On the morning of July 20, the People's Army launched a general offensive and annihilated all the "Atomic Heroes" defending Daejeon in just seven hours, cleanly and thoroughly.
　　The Americans who invaded Korea are both brutal and cowardly. When they hold weapons in their hands, they are like a pack of jackals. On July 15, the day the People's Army forcibly crossed the Geum River, the Americans began killing people in batches in Daejeon. They used fifty-two trucks, fully loaded with unarmed Korean residents, and transported them to the mountains twenty miles south of Daejeon, where they were collectively killed. All the factories in Daejeon were burned down by the Americans. After the People's Army successfully crossed the river, the Americans immediately fled from Daejeon to the highlands around the city, and on the 17th, 18th, and 19th, continuously bombed Daejeon with large numbers of aircraft. After Daejeon was liberated, American planes continued to bomb it for several days. This city of 150,000 people was thus destroyed.
　　However, after the "Atomic Heroes" were captured, they immediately became a group of cowering sheep. Every prisoner said, "We don't want to fight." For most soldiers, this is true; they do not know why they are fighting in Korea. When the first batch of American troops boarded ships from Japan, the generals announced to the soldiers that they were "sailing home." The soldiers were very happy. Later, they discovered that the landing point was Busan and began to be greatly surprised. The generals told the second batch of American soldiers who came to Korea: "A conflict has occurred within Korea, and the Americans are going to assume police duties." The soldiers sensed that things were not good, but they had to grit their teeth and move forward. They opened fire on the Korean People's Army on the fourth day of their invasion of Korea. This process was very short, but the changes were significant. In Korea, these American soldiers felt great distress. An American prisoner of war said: "When we go to war in Korea, everyone is afraid of being killed." This is true. American generals often tell soldiers: "The Koreans only have rifles, and they can't shoot, they are timid and can't fight." However, in the Battle of Suwon, the American soldiers encountered very fierce firepower and extremely strong attacking spirit from the People's Army. They began to discover that the People's Army was a lion, not a sheep. The threat of death has since hovered over the heads of the Americans all day long. Some American prisoners of war also said: Korea is not a good place. There are too many mosquitoes, and they can't sleep because of the bites. The land is barren and the people are poor, and there is nothing good to eat. Some prisoners even inhumanly said: "Korean girls are not as beautiful as Japanese girls." Some were confused and said: "I don't know why, Korean children all hate Americans?" These beasts in clothes are so particular about their base pleasures. They completely build their own happiness on the suffering of others. As a result, it aroused the irreconcilable anger and resistance of the Korean people (including children). The Americans did not learn the necessary lessons from this just resistance. Instead, they became beastly and took various weapons to madly plunder, destroy, kill, and set fires in Korea.
　　Further excavating the thoughts of American prisoners, I found that most of them are so ignorant, blind, and uninformed. Most of their various evil thoughts and actions are produced by the megalomania of the American spirit. After asking them two "whys" in a row, they will be at a loss. However, there are also some adventurers who consciously came to Korea to commit crimes. For example, Sergeant Diegmann came to Korea to fight in order to get a house. He said: The housing shortage in the United States is very serious. If the war is won and he is promoted to an official position, he can buy a house in the United States. Now, Diegmann has a house to live in, living in a beautiful prisoner-of-war camp in Korea. The People's Army treats prisoners of war well.
　　The People's Army has knocked down the ferocity of the Americans on the battlefield and given them the necessary preferential treatment in the prisoner-of-war camps. These two appropriate methods have slowly sobered the prisoners. Many prisoners of war have signed peace declarations. And they said that if they can return to the United States alive this time, they will never fight again in the future. Artillery Lieutenant Hawtman was captured by the Germans in Europe at the end of World War II, doing hard labor, not getting enough to eat, and constantly being whipped and humiliated. Fortunately, he did not die. This time, he was captured by the People's Army again, enjoying completely different treatment from the first time. He seemed to be really moved and muttered: "If I don't die this time, I will never fight again!" It can be said with certainty that he will not die. As for fighting for the capitalists, he should wake up in the future.

### “原子英雄”的毁灭

　　“原子英雄”的毁灭
    本报朝鲜战地特派记者  李庄
    美国侵略军第二十四师团，在朝鲜完全覆灭了。一万八千个美国人，一部分幸运地作了朝鲜人民军的俘虏，大部分则以他们自己的污血，沾辱了朝鲜的土地。这些“原子英雄”于七月一日在釜山登陆，七月二十日在大田最后被歼，前后整整二十天。美国俘虏们非常颓丧地说：“二十——这对于我们是种不祥的数字。”
    美国人看不起李承晚傀儡军，他们说：水原、平泽、天安、乌致院（均在汉城到大田铁路线上）几次战役所以失败，主要原因是傀儡军没有打好。于是，他们撵开残余的傀儡军，自己当了大田战役的主力。大田北临锦江，江面宽五百余米。江与城间是一带高地。美国人在高地上构筑了一百多座炮垒，在炮垒前面摆列着百辆以上的坦克。按照他们自己的看法，这是万无一失的。七月十五日，人民军白昼强渡锦江，用坦克车上的巨炮，摧毁了美国人的炮垒，三面包围了大田。七月二十日晨，人民军发动总攻，仅仅打了七小时，就把据守大田的“原子英雄”们全部歼灭，干脆而且彻底。
    侵入朝鲜的美国人，既残暴又怯懦。当着他们手执武器的时候，就像一群豺狼。七月十五日，即人民军强渡锦江的那一天，美国人开始在大田成批杀人。他们用五十二部卡车，满载着手无寸铁的朝鲜居民，运到大田以南二十里的山中集体杀死。大田城内一切工厂，都被美国人烧毁了。人民军渡江成功后，美国人立即从大田城内逃到城周的高地上，而在十七、十八、十九三日，连续以大队飞机狂炸大田。大田解放后，美国飞机又继续轰炸了好几天。这个十五万人口的城市，就这样被毁灭了。
    但是，当着“原子英雄”们被俘以后，立刻变成一群畏缩的羊。每一个俘虏都说：“我们不愿意打仗。”对于大部分士兵来讲，这是真实的，他们并不晓得到朝鲜打仗是为了什么。第一批美国军队从日本上船时，将军们向士兵宣布是“乘船回国”。士兵都很高兴。后来，他们发现登陆地点是釜山，开始大吃一惊。将军们对第二批到朝鲜的美国士兵说：“朝鲜内部发生冲突，美国人要去担负警察任务。”士兵们预感到事情不妙，但也只得硬着头皮前进了。他们侵入朝鲜的第四天，就向朝鲜人民军开了火。这一过程时间很短，但其变化甚大。在朝鲜，这些美国兵感到莫大的苦恼。美国俘虏兵说：“我们到朝鲜打仗，每个人都怕被打死。”这是真的。美国将军们时常对士兵宣传：“朝鲜人只有来福枪，而且不会射击，胆小，不能打仗。”但是，水原一战，美国兵遇见的人民军火力很猛，攻击精神极旺。他们开始发现人民军是狮子不是绵羊。死亡的威胁，从此整日盘旋在美国人的头上。还有的美国俘虏兵说：朝鲜不是好地方。蚊子太多，咬得他们睡不好。地瘠民贫，没有好东西吃。有些俘虏甚至毫无人性地说：“朝鲜姑娘不如日本姑娘漂亮。”有的则困惑地说：“不知道为什么，朝鲜小孩子都讨厌美国人？”这些穿着衣裳的野兽，竟是如此讲究卑污的享受。他们完全把自己的愉快，建立在别人的痛苦上。结果，引起了朝鲜人民（包括小孩子）不共戴天的愤怒和反抗。美国人没有在这种正义的反抗中领受必要的教训，他们反而兽性大发，拿着各种武器，在朝鲜疯狂地抢掠、破坏、杀人与放火。
    进一步挖掘美国俘虏的思想，我发现他们之中的大部分，是这样愚昧、盲目和无知。他们的各种各样的罪恶思想和行动，大部是由美国精神的自大狂产生的。连着询问他们两个“为什么”，他们就要茫无所措了。但是，其中也有一些冒险家，竟是自觉地到朝鲜来犯罪的。例如，军曹第格曼（H·Diegmann）到朝鲜打仗，是为了得到一所房子。他说：美国房荒非常严重，假若作战胜利，升个一官半职，就可以在美国买一所房子。现在，第格曼有房可住了，住在朝鲜漂亮的俘虏营中。人民军是优待俘虏的。
    人民军在战场上打掉了美国人的凶焰，又在俘虏营中予以必要的优待。这两种恰当的方法，使俘虏们的头脑慢慢清醒了。许多俘虏兵在和平宣言上签了名。并且表示，这次如能生还美国，今后永远不再打仗。炮兵少尉霍特曼（L·Hawtman），在第二次大战末期曾在欧洲被德国人俘虏过，做苦工，吃不饱，不断遭受鞭打和污辱。万幸没有死掉。这一次，他又被人民军俘虏了，享受着和第一次完全两样的待遇。他似乎是真正感动了，喃喃地说：“这回如果死不了，以后再也不打仗了！”可以肯定地告诉他，死是死不了的。至于替资本家打仗，以后应当觉醒了。
