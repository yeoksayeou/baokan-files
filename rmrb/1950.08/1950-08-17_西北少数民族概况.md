　　An Overview of Ethnic Minorities in Northwest China
　　Zhao Wenjie
    Nearly 20 Ethnic Minorities with a Population of Approximately Seven Million in the Five Northwest Provinces
    The vast land of Northwest China in the People's Republic of China is a region where ethnic minorities propagate, grow, and congregate.
    In the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, in addition to the Han ethnic group, there are also nearly 20 ethnic minorities including the Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, Salar, Tu, Manchu, Tatar, Tajik, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Siberian, Solon, and Russian, with a total population of approximately seven million. This accounts for about 30 percent of the total population of 23 million in the Northwest region. Among them, the Hui ethnic group numbers approximately two million, mainly distributed in the five counties west of the Tao River in Gansu, including Linxia, the six counties south of the Longshan Mountains, including Qingshui, the seven counties along the Jing River, including Pingliang, the area from Wuwei to Jiuquan along the Hexi Corridor, the area east of the Yellow River in Ningxia, including Lingwu, and around Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province. The Mongolian ethnic group numbers approximately 150,000, mainly distributed in the northern foothills of the Helan Mountains in Ningxia, the two independent banners of Alxa and Ejin, the 29 Oirat Mongolian banners in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, and the Torghut and Khoshut tribes around Ebi Lake in northeastern Xinjiang and Bosten Lake in central Xinjiang. The Tibetan ethnic group numbers approximately 600,000, mainly distributed in Yushu at the eastern foot of the Bayan Har Mountains, around the Jishi Mountains, south of Qinghai Lake, and in the two districts of Labrang and Zhuoni in Gansu. The Uyghur ethnic group numbers approximately three million, mainly distributed in the fertile oasis regions north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang. The Kazakh ethnic group numbers approximately 450,000, mainly distributed in the vast grasslands from the Altai Mountains to Barkol Lake in northern Xinjiang. The remaining ethnic groups range from about 50,000 to 60,000 people to as few as 10,000 to 20,000 people. The Salar and Tu ethnic groups mainly live on the south bank of the Datong River in Qinghai; the Tatar, Tajik, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Siberian, Solon, Manchu, and Russian ethnic groups mainly live in the Ili River basin in Xinjiang.
    Two Forms of Economic Life
    The economic lives of these ethnic groups can be divided into two forms. The Hui, Uyghur, Manchu, Salar, Tatar, Uzbek, Siberian, Solon, and Russian ethnic groups mostly engage in agriculture, supplemented by textile, sericulture, gold and jade, and other side occupations; the Mongolian, Tibetan, Kazakh, Tu, Tajik, and Kyrgyz ethnic groups mostly engage in animal husbandry, supplemented by hunting, fur, and other side occupations. In terms of religious belief, except for the Manchu, Siberian, Solon, and Russian ethnic groups who have no fixed religious beliefs, the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Tu ethnic groups all believe in Lamaism, and the Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Salar, Tatar, Tajik, Uzbek, and Kyrgyz ethnic groups all believe in Islam.
    Armed Struggles Repeatedly Unleashed Under the Rule of Successive Great-National Chauvinists
    Each ethnic minority in the Northwest region has its own long history and unique or common written language, spoken language, customs, and habits. The vast majority of people in each ethnic group are hardworking. For thousands of years, some of them have engaged in agricultural production, "working at sunrise and resting at sunset," while others have "lived by water and grass," developing animal husbandry. However, under the dark rule of successive feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang reactionaries' great-Han chauvinism, they have all suffered endless exploitation and oppression. The lives of the people of all ethnic groups have been filled with sorrow and poverty, and the history of the people of all ethnic groups has been stained with blood and tears. In particular, Zuo Zongtang, the loyal dog of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, bloodily washed the Northwest minority areas. Feudal warlords such as Yang Zengxin, Jin Shuren, Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui, and Sheng Shicai and the Kuomintang reactionary bandits adopted policies of high pressure and division, imposed exorbitant taxes and levies, created estrangement and hatred among the people of all ethnic groups, hindered the economic and cultural development of the people of all ethnic groups, affected the reproduction of the population of the people of all ethnic groups, deprived the people of all ethnic groups of the right to participate in politics, and forced the people of all ethnic groups to live a life of oppression, deception, and ignorance.
    In order to strive for ethnic survival, the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest region have bravely launched struggles against reactionary rulers. In the past two hundred years, countless armed riots have occurred in the Northwest region by people of all ethnic groups against great-Han chauvinist rule. Among them, the larger and more widespread ones include: the war of the Uyghur people led by Yakub Beg and Akhun Tumin against the Manchu Qing Dynasty from 1864 to 1877; the war of the Uyghur and Kazakh people led by Hoji Niyaz against the feudal warlord Jin Shuren from 1931 to 1933; and the war of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang led by Akhmetjan Qasimi against the Kuomintang reactionaries from 1944 to 1949. Some of these armed struggles failed due to the brutal suppression by reactionary armed forces or the betrayal of the ruling classes within the people of all ethnic groups; some disintegrated because they lacked a clear political program and strict organizational discipline. As for the armed struggles of the Ili, Tarbagatai, and Altai regions to seek survival and liberation, they were blocked by the Kuomintang reactionaries within the three districts, and the stalemate lasted for five years.
    In May 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army began its heroic march into the Great Northwest. This people's army exemplarily implemented the Communist Party's policy of ethnic equality and ethnic unity, respected the customs and habits of the people of all ethnic groups, protected mosques and Lama temples, and used practical actions to shatter the Kuomintang reactionaries' shameless slanders that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army would "exterminate the Hui and destroy religion," winning the sincere support of the people of all ethnic groups. With the enthusiastic support of the people of all ethnic groups, the People's Liberation Army quickly eliminated the bandit troops of Hu and Ma and completely liberated the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest.
    After the Liberation of the Five Northwest Provinces, a New Relationship of Unity, Friendship, and Mutual Assistance Began to Be Established Among All Fraternal Ethnic Groups
    After the liberation of the five Northwest provinces, under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, all ethnic groups ended the evil rule of feudal dynasties, feudal warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries for thousands of years. Based on the principle of ethnic equality in the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, they established people's governments at all levels composed of all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, and all democratic parties, and improved the political status of the people of all ethnic groups. For example, among the 49 members of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the highest leading body of the five Northwest provinces, there are four Hui members and two Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uyghur members each. A national affairs committee was specially established under the Military and Political Committee to carry out various ethnic works. Among the 31 members of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, where ethnic minorities are concentrated, there are nine Uyghur, three Kazakh, four Han, two Hui, and one each from Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Uzbek, Tatar, Siberian and Russian ethnic groups. Other provinces have also basically formed the provincial people's government committees according to the proportion of the population of each ethnic group, and are gradually enriching and establishing people's governments at all levels in counties, districts, and townships, and implementing ethnic regional autonomy. For example, the Alxa Banner, Ejin Banner, and Labrang districts have all initially established autonomous governments. All provinces have basically convened people's representatives conferences of all ethnic groups and all circles with the county as the unit, and through the people's representatives conferences, they have mediated ethnic disputes and established new mutual relations of unity, mutual assistance, friendship, and cooperation among all fraternal ethnic groups.
    However, due to the long-term mutual killings and deep estrangement between the various ethnic groups in history; the lack of experience in working in ethnic minority areas among some Han cadres in the early days of liberation, and the simplistic and impatient working methods; and the influence of the remnants of great-Han chauvinism, some deviations occurred in the implementation of ethnic policies. On the minority ethnic side, due to differences in language and writing, they could not quickly understand the Communist Party and the people's government's ethnic policies, and bandits and special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors and deceive, and carry out sabotage activities. Ethnic disputes and killings have occurred between the Hui and Han ethnic groups, and between the Hui and Tibetan ethnic groups in Linxia and Pingliang in Gansu, and Datong and Huzhu in Qinghai. The people's government immediately adopted cautious steps based on the ethnic unity policy, on the one hand inspecting the work and correcting the deviations, and on the other hand carrying out in-depth propaganda of the ethnic policies, so that the people of all ethnic groups deeply realized that only the Communist Party and the people's government are the saviors of ethnic minorities. The minority of the people of all ethnic groups who were deceived consciously broke away from the influence of bandits and special agents, and assisted the people's government in suppressing bandits and special agents, so that ethnic disputes and killings quickly subsided, laying the foundation for the unity, mutual assistance, and common construction of the Great Northwest by all fraternal ethnic groups in the future.
    Under the Leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, We Are Starting to Create a Happy and Fulfilling New Northwest
    In most areas of the five Northwest provinces, the Chinese Communist Party has initially established organizations and has absorbed outstanding members of all ethnic groups into the Party. In Xinjiang Province, more than 400 people including Saifuddin were admitted into the Party within half a year. All provinces have also widely held training classes for ethnic minorities, and have trained more than 2,000 working cadres from all ethnic groups, and have systematically promoted ethnic minority cadres to various levels of government to take on various jobs, and cultivate and train the leading backbone of all ethnic groups. Local people's governments have begun to systematically and step by step help the people of all ethnic groups to restore and develop production, especially the state-owned trade agencies have carried out fair, reasonable, and free trade in various ethnic minority areas, purchasing local products of the people of all ethnic groups, such as fur, casings, highland barley, and medicinal materials, stimulating the production enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups, and enabling the lives of the people of all ethnic groups to be initially improved. The various work measures of the people's government have won the sincere support of the people of all ethnic groups and all classes. In the future, the people of all ethnic groups and all classes in the Northwest will be more united, move forward along the road of new democracy, jointly start to build a big family of friendship and cooperation, and jointly start to create a happy and fulfilling new Northwest. Historical facts have proved that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the people of all ethnic groups be liberated.

　　西北少数民族概况
　　赵文节
    西北五省少数民族近二十种人口约七百万
    中华人民共和国西北部辽阔的土地，是中国少数民族繁殖、生长、荟聚的地区。
    在陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆五省，除汉族外，还有回族、蒙族、藏族、维吾尔族、哈萨克族、撒拉族、土族、满族，塔塔尔族、塔吉克族、乌兹别克族、柯尔克斯族、锡伯族、索伦族、俄罗斯族等近二十种少数民族，人口共约七百万左右，约占西北区人口总数二千三百万的百分之三十。其中回族约二百万人，主要分布于甘肃洮河西岸临夏等五县，陇山南麓清水等六县，泾水两畔平凉等七县，河西走廊武威至酒泉一线，以及宁夏黄河东岸灵武一带和青海省会西宁周围。蒙族约十五万人，主要分布于宁夏贺兰山北麓，阿拉善与额济纳二独立旗，青海柴达木盆地的额鲁特蒙古二十九旗，以及新疆东北部之艾比湖、中部之博斯腾湖周围的土尔扈特部及和硕特部。藏族约六十万人，主要分布于巴颜喀喇山东麓的玉树、积石山左右，青海湖南岸以及甘肃的拉卜楞及卓尼两区。维吾尔族约三百万人，主要分布于新疆天山南北富饶的绿洲地区。哈萨克族约四十五万人，主要分布于新疆北部阿尔泰山至巴里坤湖广大的草原地带。其余各族，多者约五、六万人，少者仅一、二万人。撒拉族、土族主要聚居于青海大通河南岸；塔塔尔族、塔吉克族、乌兹别克族、柯尔克斯族、锡伯族、索伦族、满族、俄罗斯族主要杂居于新疆伊犁河流域。
    经济生活的两种形态
    这些民族的经济生活可分为两种形态。回族、维吾尔族、满族、撒拉族、塔塔尔族、乌兹别克族、锡伯族、索伦族、俄罗斯族大都以农业为主，兼营纺织、蚕桑、金玉等副业；蒙族、藏族、哈萨克族、土族、塔吉克族、柯尔克斯族大都以牧畜为主，兼营狩猎、皮毛等副业。在宗教信仰上，除满族、锡伯族、索伦族、俄罗斯族无固定宗教信仰外，蒙族、藏族、土族，都信奉喇嘛教，回族、维吾尔族、哈萨克族、撒拉族、塔塔尔族、塔吉克族、乌兹别克族、柯尔克斯族都信奉伊斯兰教。
    在历代大民族主义的统治下曾不断掀起武装斗争
    西北区各个少数民族，都有着自己民族悠久的历史和特有的或共同的文字、语言、风俗和习惯。各民族的广大人民都是勤劳的。几千年来，他们中间有的“日出而作，日入而息”的进行农业生产，有的“逐水草而居”，发展牧畜事业。但是，在历代封建皇朝及国民党反动派大民族主义的黑暗统治下，他们都遭受到无穷无尽的剥削和压迫，各族人民的生活充满了悲痛和贫困，各族人民的历史涂满了鲜血和眼泪。特别是满清皇朝忠实的走狗左宗棠血洗西北少数民族地区，封建军阀杨增新、金树仁、马步芳、马鸿逵、盛世才之流及国民党反动匪帮等采用高压与分化政策，实行苛捐杂税，横征暴敛，造成了各族人民间的隔阂与仇视，阻碍了各族人民在经济与文化上的发展，影响了各族人民人口的繁殖，剥夺了各族人民参与政治的权利，迫使各族人民过着被压迫、被欺骗、被闭塞的生活。
    西北各族人民为了争取民族生存，曾奋不顾身地掀起了反抗反动统治者的斗争。近二百年来，西北地区曾经发生过各族人民反对大民族主义统治的无数次武装暴动，其中规模较大和较广泛的有：一八六四年到一八七七年维吾尔族人民在阿古柏与阿訇妥明领导下，反对满清皇朝的战争；一九三一年至一九三三年维吾尔族、哈萨克族人民在和加尼牙子领导下反对封建军阀金树仁的战争，以及一九四四年至一九四九年新疆各族人民在阿合买提江领导下反对国民党反动派的战争。这些武装斗争，有的由于反动武装的残酷镇压或各族人民内部统治阶级中途的叛变而失败了；有的因为没有明确的政治纲领和严密的组织纪律而分崩离析。至于伊、塔、阿三区求生存、求解放的武装斗争，被国民党反动派阻于三区之内，相持达五年之久。
    一九四九年五月，中国人民解放军开始向大西北英勇进军。这支人民的队伍，模范地执行了共产党民族平等与民族团结的政策，尊重各族人民的风俗习惯，保护清真寺和喇嘛庙，用实际行动粉碎了国民党反动派捏造共产党、人民解放军“灭回灭教”的无耻谰言，获得了各族人民真诚的拥护。人民解放军并在各族人民的热烈支援下，迅速消灭了胡马匪军，完全解放了西北各族的人民。
    西北五省解放后各兄弟民族之间开始建立起团结友爱互助的新关系
    西北五省解放以后，各个民族在中国共产党的领导与帮助下，结束了几千年来封建皇朝、封建军阀和国民党反动派的罪恶统治，并且根据人民政协共同纲领民族平等的原则，建立了包括各民族、各民主阶层、各民主党派所组成的各级人民政权，提高了各族人民的政治地位。如西北五省的最高领导机关——西北军政委员会的四十九名委员中，就有回族委员四人，蒙族、藏族及维吾尔族委员各二人。军政委员会下专门设立了民族事务委员会，进行各项民族工作。而在少数民族集中的新疆省人民政府的三十一名委员中，计有维吾尔族九人，哈萨克族三人，汉族四人，回族二人，柯尔克斯族、蒙族、乌兹别克族、塔塔尔族、锡伯族、俄罗斯族各一人。其他各省基本上也都按照各民族人口的比例组成了省人民政府委员会，并在逐渐充实和建立各县、区、乡的各级人民政府，实行民族区域自治，例如阿拉善旗、额济纳旗及拉卜楞等区均已初步建立了自治政府。各省基本上都以县为单位，召开了各族各界人民代表会议，并通过人民代表会议，调解了各族纠纷，建立起各个兄弟民族间团结互助、友爱合作的新的相互关系。
    但是，由于历史上各族之间长期的仇杀与深重的隔阂；各地解放初期部分汉族干部缺乏少数民族地区工作经验，工作方法简单急躁；以及大民族主义思想残余的影响，因此在执行民族政策中发生若干偏向。在少数民族方面，由于语言和文字的不同，不能很快地了解共产党和人民政府的民族政策，土匪特务便乘机造谣欺骗，进行破坏活动。甘肃的临夏、平凉，青海的大通、互助等县的回族和汉族，回族和藏族之间，都发生过民族纠纷和仇杀事件。人民政府当即根据民族团结政策，采取慎重的步骤，一面检查工作，纠正偏向，一面深入宣传民族政策，使得各族人民深刻地认识到只有共产党和人民政府是少数民族的救星。各民族中少数被欺骗的人民，便自觉地脱离土匪特务的影响，协助人民政府清剿土匪特务，使民族纠纷和仇杀事件迅告平息，打下了今后各兄弟民族团结互助共同建设大西北的基础。
    在中国共产党的领导下着手创建美满幸福的新西北
    在西北五省大部地区中国共产党已初步建立了组织，并且吸收了各族人民的优秀分子入党，新疆省在半年内，便吸收了赛福鼎等四百余人入党。各省并广泛举办了少数民族训练班，已培养出各族人民的工作干部两千多名，并有计划地提拔了少数民族干部到各级政府中担任各项工作，培养和锻炼各族人民的领导骨干。各地人民政府已开始有计划有步骤地帮助各族人民恢复和发展生产事业，特别是国营贸易机关在各少数民族地区进行了公平合理自由的贸易，收购各族人民的土产，如毛皮、肠衣、青稞、药材等，刺激了各族人民的生产情绪，使各族人民的生活获得初步改善。人民政府的各项工作措施，已获得各民族、各阶层人民的热诚拥护。今后，西北各民族、各阶层人民将更加团结一致，遵循着新民主主义的道路向前迈进，共同着手建设友爱合作的大家庭，共同着手创造幸福美满的新西北。历史事实证明：只有在中国共产党的领导下，各族人民才能得到解放。
