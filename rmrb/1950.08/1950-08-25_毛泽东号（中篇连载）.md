  Three, Before Getting on the Train

    Comrade Song, the military representative of the locomotive depot, talked to Li Yong, asking him to go to the "Mao Zedong Locomotive."

    Li Yong didn't dare to agree immediately, saying:

    "This locomotive is not simple, and it's named after the leader, and it's a contracted responsibility system. If there is an accident, I can't bear it!"

    "Everyone knows you, you never have accidents."

    "Besides, I'm an outsider, I'm afraid they won't accept me as the driver."

    Representative Song further explained to him: "As long as you discuss things with everyone more, unite everyone, let everyone come up with ideas and solutions, things will be easy to handle, and everyone will not be unconvinced.

    "I'll be the driver, find someone else for the driver position."

    Representative Song also told him a lot of reasons: Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang is frantically attacking, and the military transportation task is very urgent. Now that the workers are the masters of the country, they should overcome all difficulties to work. Finally, he said:

    "All of this is to prevent the reactionaries from oppressing and enslaving us again, and living a life worse than cattle and horses."

    Li Yong's face changed when he thought of the decades of suffering in the past, and said:

    "Representative Song, in that case, I will obey the assignment..." He seemed to have something more to say, but choked up.

    On June 9, 1947, Li Yong arrived at the "Mao Zedong Locomotive."

  Four, First Display of Skills

    But as soon as he got on the train, Li Yong was worried again:

    Not familiar with the locomotive! Can't figure out the temperament of the workers!

    Coincidentally, there was a task that night to drive to Yimianpo.

    Everyone said:

    "Let Zheng Dugong and Zhang Chuanzhong work with the driver." (Note 1)

    The old hero wasn't familiar with anyone anyway, so he said:

    "Okay! Okay!"

    The green signal light (Note 2) turned on, and the green hand light in the shunter's hand also shook up and down, the train was about to leave.

    "Wow!" The locomotive cried out. "Hiss!..." The steam let out a long sound.

    Oh no! Suddenly the water pump (Note 3) stopped supplying water.

    Stoker Zheng Dugong clicked his tongue, and at the same time glanced at the apprentice stoker Zhang Chuanzhong.

    Zhang Chuanzhong then said:

    "Old hero, we have a contracted train, it all depends on you!"

    Large beads of sweat immediately emerged on Li Yong's forehead and the tip of his nose, shining in the firelight reflected from the furnace door. He immediately said:

    "Everyone, please help! I just arrived, I don't know anything. Don't look at me being old, my skills are far behind." As he spoke, he picked up a hand hammer and an adjustable wrench.

    He stepped onto the running board, walked to the water pump, looked here and there; then climbed onto the boiler, checked the water pipe and tank check valve (Note 4), he opened the tank check valve, moved this and twisted that, and strangely enough, after his three and two strokes, he fixed the water pump.

    It didn't delay the departure time at all.

    Slap! Zheng Dugong "smacked" Zhang Chuanzhong on the back of the head, glanced at the old hero, and said:

    "Hey, old ginger is still spicy!"

    Zhang Chuanzhong was bending over adding coal to the furnace door, turned around and gave Zheng Dugong a punch:

    "Damn old sage, don't use your hands and feet during work!"

    "I wanted you to see that people really have skills."

    "If people have skills, why would you hit someone?"

    The old hero looked back and saw that Zheng Dugong had thick, dark eyebrows and was a young man in his early twenties. "How did such a young man become an old sage?" he thought.

    But the train was running faster and faster, and he couldn't bother to think about it, so he concentrated all his energy on the handwheel (Note 5), steam valve, and air brake (Note 6).

    Note 1: The locomotive contract responsibility system has nine people, divided into three shifts. Three people per shift.

    Note 2: Green light to start, red light to stop.

    Note 3: A water injector.

    Note 4: Because the boiler has steam, it uses it to hold down the steam, so that water can be injected into the boiler.

    Note 5: Controls the locomotive going forward and backward.

    Note 6: Used for stopping. (Attached picture)

  三、上车以前
    机务段的军事代表宋同志找李永谈，要他到“毛泽东号”去。
    李永不敢马上答应，说：
    “这台车不单简，又叫着领袖的名子，又是包乘负责制，万一出了事故，我可担不起啊！”
    “谁都知道你，从来不出事故。”
    “再说，我是外来的，当司机长怕他们不服。”
    宋代表又向他解释：“只要遇事多和大家商量，团结大家，让大家出主意想办法，事情就好办，大家也不会不服。
    “我当司机，司机长找别人好。”
    宋代表又给他讲了不少道理：蒋匪帮疯狂进攻，军事运输任务非常紧急。现在工人做了国家的主人，应该克服一切困难来工作。末了说：
    “这一切，为的是不让反动派再来压迫奴役我们，过那牛马不如的生活。”
    李永一想起过去几十年的辛酸日子，面色变了，说道：
    “宋代表，这么说，我服从分配。……”他似乎还有话要说，可是哽住了。
    一九四七年六月九号，李永到了“毛泽东号”。
  四、初献身手
    可是一上车，李永又担心：
    对机车不熟悉！对工友们摸不清脾气！
    可巧，当天晚上就有任务，要开车到一面坡。
    大伙儿都说：
    “郑笃恭和张传忠跟司机长一班吧。”（注一）
    老英雄反正跟谁也不熟，就说：
    “行！行！”
    绿色信号灯（注二）亮了，调车员手中的绿手灯，也一起一落摇晃着，车就要开了。
    “哇！”机车叫了一声。“嘶！……”乏气拉着长声放出来。
    糟糕！忽然水泵（注三）不来水了。
    司炉郑笃恭，舌头“得儿”响了一下，同时用眼瞟一瞟学习司炉张传忠。
    张传忠就说：
    “老英雄，咱们是包车制，全靠你啦！”
    李永的额角上鼻尖上，立刻冒出一颗颗大汗珠，在炉门映出的火光中发亮。他紧接着说：
    “伙计们多帮忙！我刚来，一门不摸。别看我年纪大，论技术还差得远。”说着，就拿起手锤和活螺丝搬子来。
    他踏上走板，走到水泵旁边，这么一看，那么一看；又爬上锅炉，把水管和罐逆止弁（注四）检查一遍，他揭开罐逆止弁，动动这拧拧那，说也怪，经他三?捣两?捣，可就把水泵修好了。
    一点也没有耽误发车时间。
    拍！郑笃恭照着张传忠的后脑上“码”了一家伙，又瞟了老英雄一眼，说道：
    “哎，姜还是老的辣！”
    张传忠正弯着腰往炉门里添煤，扭转身就给了郑笃恭一拳：
    “他妈的老圣人，工作时间少动手动脚！”
    “我叫你看看人家真有两下。”
    “人家有两下，用着你打人？”
    老英雄回头一看，郑笃恭长着两条又粗又黑的好眼眉，是个二十出头的小伙子。“这样一个青年怎么就成了老圣人了？”他想。
    可是车越跑越快，他也顾不得细想，就把全副精神集中到手把（注五），汽门和风闸（注六）上面去了。
    注一：机车包乘负责制共九个人，分三班。每班三个人。
    注二：绿灯开车，红灯停车。
    注三：上水的注水器。
    注四：因锅炉有汽，用它压住汽，水才能注入锅炉。
    注五：管机车前后走的。
    注六：停车用的。（附图片）
