Xinhua News Agency, 27th: TASS, Moscow - Viktorov published an article in "Pravda" on the 25th titled "Sebald's Deliberately Fabricated Lies," exposing the slanderous and fabricated statement made by this US representative to the Allied Council for Japan on August 2 regarding the Soviet repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war.

Viktorov pointed out that everyone, including Sebald, clearly knows that the Soviet Union's work of repatriating Japanese prisoners of war has been completed. However, news carried in Japanese newspapers shows that tens of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war left in American-controlled areas such as the Philippines, areas near Australia, Burma, Malaya, French Indochina, and other countries remain missing to this day.

Viktorov reiterated the precise and accurate statistical materials regarding the Soviet Union's repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war, which had been published in Soviet newspapers. These materials stated that all Japanese prisoners of war who were to be repatriated have been repatriated, with the exception of 1,487 prisoners who have been convicted or are being tried for war crimes and nine prisoners who will be repatriated after medical treatment is completed. In addition, 971 prisoners of war will be handed over to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China because they committed serious crimes against the Chinese people. Viktorov pointed out that all these materials were published in TASS's statement of June 9, 1950. Sebald, who is completely familiar with this material, attempted to slander the Soviet note of July 16 in his statement of August 2, deliberately asserting that the section of the note quoting TASS's statements of April 22 and June 9, 1950, exceeded the normal mode of communication between the two countries. Viktorov pointed out that we cannot believe that Sebald does not know that TASS is "the Soviet Telegraph Agency under the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union." The reason Sebald wants to distort these simple facts is to use this rhetoric to divert the Japanese people's attention from the atrocities of the American occupation authorities in Japan and the cruel and reactionary policies of politically and economically enslaving the Japanese people, and to hide the fact that the United States is turning Japan into a military base and turning Japanese youth into cannon fodder for American imperialism.

Viktorov pointed out that Sebald's lie that 370,000 Japanese prisoners of war remained in the Soviet Union was based on the so-called "statistical materials" of the Japanese government. However, he forgot that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida admitted in a speech to the Japanese parliament on February 7 this year that this figure "is based on speculation."

Viktorov revealed the following ugly fact: the Japanese Foreign Ministry, under the orders of MacArthur's headquarters, recently instructed each prefecture to provide "evidence." Attached to the instruction were fabricated figures assigned to each prefecture by MacArthur's headquarters, indicating the supposed number of prisoners of war from that prefecture who had not returned from the Soviet Union. According to MacArthur's assignment, Tokyo should prove that 3,000 prisoners of war had not returned home. However, after doing its best to carry out this order, the local authorities could only provide contradictory "evidence" for fewer than 1,000 prisoners of war.

Viktorov wrote in conclusion: Facts are more powerful than any lies, slander, and conspiracy, and the conspiracy of American swindlers is doomed to failure. The Japanese people will certainly give MacArthur and Sebald's dark dealings a proper evaluation.

### 真理报专文揭露赛鲍尔谎言  苏联遣送日俘工作早已完成  美国命令吉田伪造未遣数字诡计完全失败

　　真理报专文揭露赛鲍尔谎言
    苏联遣送日俘工作早已完成
    美国命令吉田伪造未遣数字诡计完全失败
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：维克托罗夫于二十五日在“真理报”上发表题为《赛鲍尔故意制造的谎言》一文，揭穿这位美国出席盟国对日委员会的代表，于八月二日就苏联遣送日本战俘一事所发表的诽谤捏造的声明。
    维克托罗夫指出：每一个人，包括赛鲍尔在内，都清楚地知道，苏联遣送日本战俘的工作已经完成。而据日本报纸所载的消息表明：战后成千成万被留在美国控制地区的菲律宾、澳大利亚附近地区、缅甸、马来亚、法属印度支那和其他国家的日本战俘，则至今依然下落不明。
    维克托罗夫重新引述了苏联报纸曾经登载过的关于苏联遣送日本战俘的精密确实的统计材料。该材料说明了应予遣送的日本战俘业已遣送完毕，只有一千四百八十七名已定罪的和正在审讯其战争罪行的战俘尚未遣送，九名战俘将在医疗完毕后遣送。此外，尚有九百七十一名战俘，因对中国人民犯了严重罪行，而将被移交给中华人民共和国中央人民政府。维克托罗夫指出：所有这些材料，均曾在塔斯社一九五○年六月九日的声明中公布。完全熟悉这项材料的赛鲍尔，在他八月二日的声明中企图中伤苏联七月十六日的照会，故意武断地说：照会中引用塔斯社一九五○年四月二十二日及六月九日的声明一节，超出了两个国家之间正常的交际方式。维克托罗夫指出：我们不可能相信赛鲍尔不知道塔斯社是“附属于苏联部长会议之下的苏联电讯社”。赛鲍尔之所以要曲解这些简单的事实，是想用这种花言巧语，以转移日本人民对美国占领当局在日本的暴行和在政治上、经济上奴役日本人民的残酷反动政策的注意；并图隐瞒美国把日本变为军事基地及要把日本青年变为美帝炮灰的这一事实。
    维克托罗夫指出：赛鲍尔所说的，尚有三十七万名日本战俘留在苏联的谎言，是根据于日本政府的所谓“统计材料”，然而他忘记了日本首相吉田于今年二月七日在日本议会中演说时承认，这个数字“是根据臆测而来的”。
    维克托罗夫揭露以下丑恶的事实称：日本外务省根据麦克阿瑟总部的命令，最近训令各县提供“证据”。训令中附带有麦克阿瑟总部分派给各县的伪造数字，表示各该县未自苏联归国的战俘的假定人数。根据麦克阿瑟的分派，东京应证明确有三千名战俘尚未回国，然而地方当局在竭力执行了这个命令之后，也只能提出不足一千名战俘的矛盾“证据”。
    维克托罗夫在结语中写道：事实比任何谎言、诽谤和阴谋更强有力，美国骗子的阴谋注定是要失败的。日本人民一定会给予麦克阿瑟和赛鲍尔的黑暗勾当以适当的评价。
