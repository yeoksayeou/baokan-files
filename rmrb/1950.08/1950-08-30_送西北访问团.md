　　Sending Off the Northwest Visiting Delegation

　　Following the departure of the Southwest Visiting Delegation, which was tasked with strengthening the friendship and unity of all ethnic groups in the country, the Central People's Government is today sending another visiting delegation, led by Shen Junru, to the five provinces of the Northwest to conduct equal and friendly visits with the fraternal ethnic groups there. This visit is a major event in the history of ethnic relations in China; it will enable the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest to unite more closely in the joint construction of the new China. We respectfully wish the visiting delegation success and cheer for the friendly cooperation of the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest.

　　The Northwest is a multi-ethnic region of China, with a total of seventeen ethnic groups within the five provinces. On this vast land, the hardworking people of all ethnic groups could have lived in friendship and mutual assistance, jointly creating their own beautiful and peaceful lives. However, due to the bloody policies of enslaving the people of all ethnic groups implemented by the reactionary rulers of China in past dynasties, which deliberately created discrimination and hatred between ethnic groups, this region became a notorious site of ethnic killings in Chinese history. During the years of rule by the Kuomintang reactionaries and feudal warlords such as Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui, and Sheng Shicai, the suffering of the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest was particularly severe. They were universally subjected to brutal oppression and exploitation, and even large-scale bestial massacres, reaching the peak of the historical crimes of reactionary rule. The long-term descent of the lives of the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest into an abyss of misery, suffering, and poverty, as well as the decline in population, and the backward state of politics, economy, and culture, were all caused by this series of historical crimes.

　　But the situation now is completely different. The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution led by the Communist Party of China has fundamentally eliminated reactionary rule in Chinese history. The people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest have been completely liberated, and under the leadership of the Central People's Government, they have established people's governments at all levels, including all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, and all democratic parties. This has fundamentally ended the history of ethnic oppression and ethnic killings, and ushered in a new era of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups. This new era of ethnic relations is guaranteed by the Common Program's ethnic policies, which are based on equality, friendship, unity, and mutual assistance. Article 50 of the Common Program stipulates: "All ethnic groups within the People's Republic of China are equal, implement unity and mutual assistance, oppose imperialism and the people's enemies within all ethnic groups, and make the People's Republic of China a large family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups. Oppose great-Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, and prohibit discrimination, oppression, and acts that divide the unity of all ethnic groups."

　　Under the correct ethnic policies, the political and economic lives of the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest after liberation have undergone great changes. For example, among the 49 members of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, there are 4 Hui members, and 2 Mongolian and Uyghur members each; among the 31 members of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, there are 9 Uyghur, 3 Kazakh, 4 Han, 2 Hui, and 1 each from the Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Uzbek, Tatar, Xibe, and Russian ethnic groups; other provinces have also basically formed people's government committees in accordance with the proportion of the population of each ethnic group; and cadres of all ethnic groups are also participating in the work of county, township, and district governments in various ethnic minority areas. This has improved the political status of the people of all ethnic groups. At the same time, state-owned trade organs have carried out fair and reasonable free trade in various ethnic minority areas, purchasing local products, stimulating the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups, and enabling their lives to be initially improved. Under this new historical situation, a new relationship of friendship, cooperation, unity, and mutual assistance has begun to be established among the fraternal ethnic groups in the Northwest.

　　In order to strengthen and consolidate the friendly and cooperative relations among the fraternal ethnic groups in the Northwest, we still need to do a variety of work. The Central People's Government's dispatch of the Northwest Visiting Delegation this time is one of these many tasks. They will go to various ethnic minority areas in the Northwest provinces to represent the Central People's Government in extending greetings to the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups, and will bring back the opinions of the people of all ethnic groups on the implementation of various policies of the Central People's Government. We respectfully wish this visiting delegation will make important contributions in communicating the feelings of the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, harmonizing ethnic relations, and assisting the Central People's Government in understanding the situation of all ethnic groups in the Northwest and implementing ethnic policies in practice.

### 送西北访问团

　　送西北访问团
    以加强国内各族人民友爱团结为使命的西南访问团出发之后，中央人民政府今天又派了以沈钧儒为首的访问团赴西北五省，向那里的兄弟民族进行平等友爱的访问。这次访问，是中国民族关系史上的一件大事；这将使西北各族人民，在共同参加新中国的建设工作中更加亲密团结起来。我们敬祝访问团的成功，并为西北各族广大人民的友爱合作而欢呼。
    西北是中国多民族的地区，五省之内共有十七个民族。在这片辽阔的土地上，勤劳的各族人民，本可友爱互助，共同创造自己的美好和平的生活。但是，由于中国历代的反动统治者执行了奴役各族人民的血腥政策，有意地制造了民族间的歧视和仇恨，使这个地区成为中国历史上有名的民族仇杀的场所。在国民党反动派和马步芳、马鸿逵、盛世才等封建军阀统治的年月，西北各族人民所受的痛苦尤为深重。他们普遍地遭受到残酷的压迫和剥削，甚至是大规模的兽性屠杀，造成历史上反动统治的罪恶的最高峰。西北各族人民过去的生活长期地陷入悲惨、痛苦、贫困的深渊，以及人口的减少，政治、经济、文化各方面处于落后的状态，就是这一连串的历史罪恶所造成的。
    但是，现在的情况是完全不同了。中国共产党所领导的中国人民革命的伟大胜利，使反动统治在中国的历史上根本消灭。西北各族人民已经完全获得解放，并且在中央人民政府的领导下，建立了包括各民族、各民主阶层、各民主党派的各级人民政权。这样，就使得民族压迫，民族仇杀的历史根本结束，走入了各族人民友爱合作的新时代。这个新时代的民族关系，是被共同纲领的民族政策所保证的，平等、友爱、团结、互助的关系。共同纲领第五十条规定：“中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。反对大民族主义和狭隘民族主义，禁止民族间的歧视、压迫和分裂各民族团结的行为。”
    在正确的民族政策之下，解放后的西北各族广大人民的政治、经济生活已经大有改观。如在西北军政委员会的四十九名委员中，就有回族委员四人，蒙族、维吾尔族委员各二人；在新疆省人民政府三十一名委员中，计有维吾尔族九人，哈萨克族三人，汉族四人，回族二人，柯尔克斯族、蒙族、乌兹别克族、塔塔尔族、锡伯族、俄罗斯族各一人；其他各省也都基本上按照各民族人口的比例，组成了人民政府委员会；并且在各少数民族地区的县、乡、区政府中，也都有各民族的干部参加工作。这就提高了各族人民的政治地位。同时，国营贸易机关在各少数民族地区进行了公平合理的自由贸易，收购土产，刺激了各族广大人民的生产情绪，使他们的生活获得初步改善。在这种新的历史情况下，西北各兄弟民族间，已经开始建立了友爱、合作、团结、互助的新关系。
    为了加强与巩固西北各兄弟民族间的友爱合作的关系，我们还需要做种种的工作。中央人民政府这次派出西北访问团，就是这许多工作中的一种。他们将分别到西北各省的各少数民族地区，代表中央人民政府慰问各族广大的人民，并将带回各族人民对中央人民政府各种政策的实施意见。我们敬祝这个访问团在沟通西北各族人民感情、融洽民族关系上，在帮助中央人民政府了解西北各族情况、执行民族政策的实际工作上，都将作出重要的贡献。
