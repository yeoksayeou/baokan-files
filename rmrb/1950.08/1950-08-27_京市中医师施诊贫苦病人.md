Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctors Provide Treatment to Poor Patients

The Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, in order to ensure that poor and sick citizens receive treatment, has called on traditional Chinese medicine doctors to provide free clinics. Over two hundred traditional Chinese medicine doctors have responded to this call. Patients with proof of poverty from the local police station can receive free medical consultation, only paying a nominal fee of 500 yuan for the prescription paper. Each participating TCM doctor will be issued a clinic sign by the association to be posted in front of their clinic for identification. The association has also negotiated with over twenty TCM pharmacies in the city to provide discounts to those purchasing medicine with prescriptions from these free clinics.

    京市中医师施诊贫苦病人
    京市中医学会为使贫苦患病市民得到治疗，特号召中医师举办施诊。乡应比项号召的中医师，已有二百余人，凡持有派出所贫苦证明的病人皆可免费就诊，只收处方笺工本费五百元。每一施诊中医，均由该会发给施诊标帜张贴门前，以资识别；该会并与本市二十余家中药店洽妥，凡持施诊处方购药者，均给予折扣之优待。
