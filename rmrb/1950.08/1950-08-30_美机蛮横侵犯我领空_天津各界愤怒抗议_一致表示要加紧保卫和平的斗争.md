　　Huang Huoqing, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The Chinese people, who have won freedom and independence through arduous revolutionary struggles, cannot tolerate the United States' serious crimes of infringing upon our sovereignty, slaughtering our people, and attempting to expand the war and undermine peace. Therefore, I represent the working class of Tianjin in fully supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement and protest." More than 30 Tianjin model workers, including Pan Changyou and Liu Yinfu, jointly signed a protest against this criminal act of aggression by the United States. They also stated in their declaration: "The Chinese people have the full strength and confidence to smash all acts of aggression and provocation by warmongers.

Li Jiyie, professor at Nankai University and Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture, said: "The new atrocity committed by U.S. imperialism in our Northeast is extremely sinister and must not be ignored by the righteous people of the world. The Chinese people, standing at the forefront of the national liberation struggle, resolutely support all measures taken by the Central People's Government and pledge to be its backing, intensifying the struggle for peace."
