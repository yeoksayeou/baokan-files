Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 16th: The summer grain collection work in Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces in the Central South region is progressing smoothly, and large quantities of public grain have already been put into storage.

In Henan Province, the public grain stored has already accounted for 60% of the total task, of which 32 counties including Xuchang and Zhengzhou have completed the storage task. In Hubei Province, the public grain stored also accounts for 66% of the total summer grain collection task. The summer grain collection work in Guangdong and Guangxi regions was arranged later, but the amount to be borne has also been distributed to households, and it is expected that all of it will be put into storage by mid-September.

Before the public grain was put into storage, the above four provinces made full preparations: the county has a transportation and command post, the district and township have detachments and squadrons, and the village has squads; and in order to take care of the farmers who deliver grain, a large number of tea stations, health stations and veterinary stations have been set up along the way. At the same time, warehouses in various places have also been renovated. In Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province alone, more than 14,000 warehouse rooms have been repaired.

Thanks to the rent reduction movement, the awareness of the broad masses of farmers has been raised, and their enthusiasm for handing in grain is very high. A heat wave of sunning grain, sifting grain, handing in dry grain, and handing in clean grain has been launched everywhere. Generally, the public grain put into storage has been sunned two or three times, or even four times.

However, there are also many areas where preparations for grain collection were inadequate, resulting in losses. For example, in the Lanfeng warehouse of Chenliu Prefecture, Henan Province, the preparation work for grain collection was not done well, so that 8,000 grain-delivery farmers and more than 6,000 livestock waited for several days without being able to deliver grain, resulting in some grain-delivery farmers and livestock becoming ill. For another example, it was found in Xinyang Prefecture that 80% of the warehouses were leaking rain, causing considerable losses to the public grain.

### 豫鄂粤桂展开夏征  大批公粮已经入仓  部分地区准备不周造成损失

　　豫鄂粤桂展开夏征
    大批公粮已经入仓
    部分地区准备不周造成损失
    【新华社汉口十六日电】中南区河南、湖北、广东、广西四省的夏季征粮工作进展顺利，大批公粮已经入仓。
    河南省入仓公粮已占总任务百分之六十，其中许昌、郑州等三十二个县已全部完成入仓任务。湖北省入仓公粮亦占夏征总任务的百分之六十六。两广地区夏征工作布置较晚，也已把应负担数分配到户，预计九月中旬可全部入仓。
    上述四省在公粮入仓之前，都作了充分的准备工作：县设有调运指挥所，区、乡设大队、中队，村设有小队；并为照顾送粮农民起见，沿途设立大量茶水站、卫生站和兽医站。同时，各地仓房也进行了修整。仅河南许昌专区即修好仓房一万四千余间。
    广大农民由于经过减租运动，觉悟提高，交粮情绪甚为高涨。各地都展开了晒粮、筛粮、交干粮、交净粮的热潮。入仓公粮一般都晒过两三遍，甚至四遍。
    但也有不少地区收粮工作准备不周，因而造成了损失。如河南省陈留专区的兰封仓库，因收粮准备工作未作好，使八千送粮农民和六千余头牲口等候数日不能交粮，以致有些送粮的农民和牲畜因此患病。再如信阳专区曾发现百分之八十的仓房漏雨，使公粮受到相当损失。
