“With Our Own Government, We Can Overcome Any Difficulty!”
A Record of Township Head Zheng Hanfu Leading the Masses to Overcome a Flood in Xixian County

Caogang Township, Zhangtao District, Xixian County, Henan Province, is one of the areas most severely affected by the flood.

The township is located on the north bank of the Sha River. The entire township consists of fourteen villages, with 2,380 people and 4,999 mu of land. In June of this year, continuous heavy rains caused the river water to rise, damaging the flood control gate and breaking twelve gate panels. In order to protect the lives and property of the masses, Township Head Zheng Hanfu urgently mobilized more than 180 people to repair the gate, which was 18 feet high and 6 feet wide, using reeds, beams, sacks, adobe bricks, stone strips, ropes, and other materials. Afterwards, there were several more days of heavy rain, and the Sha River rose sharply. Nine of the township's fourteen small villages were about 10 feet lower than the riverbank. Township Head Zheng was very anxious and immediately organized the masses to protect the levee. He led twelve militiamen to patrol the embankment in the rain, and did not sleep soundly for twelve nights. One night, forty-seven breaches were washed away by the water. He led more than 300 people, using more than 970 trees, more than 320 beams, and more than 480 door panels to block the flow of water. Who knew that the next day the water became even more violent, suddenly washing away a large breach about two zhang wide. He watched the masses holding their bedding and leading their livestock, running towards the highlands, and he was so anxious that he cried. But he thought: crying is not the solution, so he started to connect six large reed mats and jumped into the water with villager Liang Hongbin, trying to use the mats to slow down the water flow so that the masses could block the breach. Who knew that the water was deep and the current was rapid, and they were washed away. The masses standing on the embankment saw this situation, and suddenly more than a dozen people jumped into the water, regardless of their own safety, and rescued them.

After Zheng Hanfu got to the shore, he saw that the flood had become a disaster. Without resting for a moment, he waded to Yuecheng, which was forty-five li away, and requested two large ferries and three small boats to rescue people and livestock to the five villages on the highlands. Under the mobilization of the township head, the people on the highlands realized that the poor all over the world are one family. Not only did they help with the rescue, but they also found houses for the disaster victims to live in and lent them food to eat.

In the nine villages affected by the flood, the crops were all drowned and washed away, and the houses were all collapsed. At this time, the masses were very anxious and thought that the only thing to do was to flee the famine.

After Township Head Zheng Hanfu rescued the masses to the highlands, he did not close his eyes all night, thinking about ways to deal with the aftermath. Before dawn, he waded to the district government, which was forty-five li away, to ask for instructions on how to handle the situation. The district government immediately sent people to comfort the disaster victims, and at the same time requested the county government to exempt the township from all 45,000 jin of public grain, and to distribute 3,000 jin of relief grain, and to lend 2,000 jin of seeds and 2.9 million yuan in loans. Before the flood had receded, people were sent by boat to Xincai County to buy buckwheat, millet, mung beans, radishes, and other seeds. As soon as the water receded, they sowed seeds on the silt, and no land was left uncultivated. Because the silt was very fertile, the seedlings grew very well. There was hope for the autumn harvest.

After the replanting work was completed, Township Head Zheng took the lead in mobilizing the masses to repair the large river breach that harmed the people.

After the disaster victims returned to their villages, they began to rebuild their homes, and each household built two sheds to live in temporarily. In order to solve the current difficulties in life, under the specific help of Township Head Zheng, they used the government's 2.9 million yuan loan to freely form mutual aid groups to sell grain, firewood, melons, and pottery. They maintained their lives under the principle of "saving and economizing."

The masses saw that their crops were growing very well and that they had government loans, which increased their confidence in overcoming the disaster through production. The people said, "With our own government, we can overcome any difficulty."

　　“有了自己的政府，啥难关都能度过！”
    记息县郑汉甫乡长领导群众度水灾
    河南息县张陶区曹岗乡，是水灾最严重的地区。
    该乡位于沙河北岸。全乡共有十四个村庄，二千三百八十人，地四千九百九十九亩。今年六月间连日大雨，河水上涨，把堵水的闸口冲坏，并冲断十二块闸板。乡长郑汉甫为保护群众的生命财产，急忙动员了一百八十余人，用芦席、梁木、麻袋、土坯、石条、绳子等物，修筑了一丈八尺高、六尺宽的闸口。其后又接连下了几天暴雨，沙河河水大涨，该乡十四个小庄中有九个都低于河堤一丈左右。郑乡长非常焦急，即把群众组织起来护堤。他带着十二个民兵在雨水中放哨看埂，曾有十二夜没有好好睡觉。有一天夜里，四十七个口子被水冲开。他领着三百多群众，用了九百七十多棵树，三百二十多根梁木，四百八十多付门板，堵住了水流。谁知第二日水势更凶，一下冲开了一个宽约两丈的大口子。他看着群众都抱着被子牵着牲口，向高地上跑，把他急得哭起来。但他想：光哭不是办法，就动手用六个大席连起来，并和村民梁鸿彬一起跳下水去，想用席子挡一下，使水流的慢点，好让群众堵口。谁知水深势急，把他们打走了。站在埂上的群众看见这个情况，顿时有十几个人亦奋不顾身的跳下水去，把他俩救上来。
    郑汉甫到岸上后，看到水灾已成，没有休息一会儿，即涉水到岳城请来了两只大渡船和三个小划子，把人及牲口都抢救到五个高岗的村上去。岗上人在乡长的动员下，认识了天下穷人是一家，不但帮助抢救，而且找房子给灾民住，并借给粮食吃。
    受到水灾的九个村，庄稼都被淹死、冲走，房屋尽都蹋倒。这时群众非常焦急，认为只有逃荒。
    郑汉甫乡长把群众抢救到岗上后，一夜没阖眼，想着善后的办法。天未发亮即涉水跑到四十五里地以外的区政府请示处理办法。区政府立即派人前往安慰灾民，一面请示县府，将该乡公粮四万五千斤全部免征，另发给救济粮三千斤，贷给种籽二千斤，贷款二百九十万元。灾民在洪水未退走前，即派人坐船到新蔡县买回荞麦、谷子、绿豆、萝卜等种籽。等水刚退去，就在淤泥上播种，连一块地也没有荒。因淤泥很肥，禾苗都长的很好。秋收有了指望。
    抢种工作完成了，郑乡长又带头动员群众，将那个危害人民的大河口子修理好。
    灾民回到村子里以后，着手重修家园，每户都盖起两间棚子暂住。为解决目前的生活困难，他们又在郑乡长的具体帮助下利用政府的二百九十万元贷款，自由结合成互助组，分别去贩粮食、贩柴、贩瓜、贩陶器。他们都在“省吃俭用”的原则下，维持着生活。
    群众看着自己的庄稼都长的很好，又有政府的贷款，提高了生产度灾的信心。老百姓都说：“咱们有了自己的政府，啥难关都能度过”。
