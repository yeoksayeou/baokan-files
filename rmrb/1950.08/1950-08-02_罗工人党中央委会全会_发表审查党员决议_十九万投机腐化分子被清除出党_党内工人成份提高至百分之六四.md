Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd dispatch: TASS, Bucharest dispatch: The Romanian Workers' Party organ, "Scânteia," published on the 20th the resolution of the Romanian Workers' Party Central Committee Plenary Session regarding the results of the review of party members and the admission of new party members.

The resolution pointed out that as a result of the review of party members conducted from November 1948 to May 1950, the Party had purged those who pursued private interests, hostile opportunists, and corrupt elements. A total of approximately 192,000 people, accounting for 20 percent of all party members before the review, were expelled from the Party.

During the review period, the social composition of the Party was also improved. The number of workers increased by 4 percent. In the Party's leading organs and at all levels of Party organizations, this percentage has increased from 53 percent to 64 percent, and in state organs, it has increased from 24.2 percent to 40 percent. More than 40,000 party members were promoted to executive positions in Party and state organs.

The Plenary Session believes that the fact that workers only account for 42 percent of all party members is absolutely unsatisfactory. The Plenary Session has stipulated tasks for the Party's organization, which is to increase the percentage of workers in the Party to 60 percent within two to three years; admission to the Party will be conducted on a strict individual basis.

The resolution of the Plenary Session pointed out that 80 percent of probationary party members approved for admission should be workers.

　　罗工人党中央委会全会
    发表审查党员决议
    十九万投机腐化分子被清除出党
    党内工人成份提高至百分之六四
    【新华社七月二十二日讯】塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚工人党机关报《火花报》，于二十日发表罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会全体会议关于审查党员和新党员入党之结果的决议。
    决议指出，自一九四八年十一月到一九五○年五月进行党员审查的结果，党已清除了营私舞弊、敌对的机会主义者和腐化分子。总计约有十九万二千人，即占审查前全体党员百分之二十的人数被逐出了党。
    在审查期间，党的社会成份也曾加以改进。工人的数目增加了百分之四。在党的领导机关和党的各级机构中，这个百分数已从百分之五十三增至百分之六十四，在国家机构中则从百分之二十四点二增至百分之四十。四万余名党员被提升担任党和国家机构的执行职务。
    工人只占全体党员的百分之四十二，全会认为这个事实绝对不能令人满意。全会为党的组织规定了任务，要在两三年之内把党内工人的百分数增至百分之六十；入党将在严格的个别的基础上进行。
    全会的决议指出，批准入党的候补党员的百分之八十应为工人。
