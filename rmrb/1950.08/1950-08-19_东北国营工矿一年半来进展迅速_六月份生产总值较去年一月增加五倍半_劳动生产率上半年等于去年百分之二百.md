Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th. Over the past year and a half, Northeast China's state-owned mining and manufacturing industries have been rapidly undergoing large-scale recovery and construction. The total output value of state-owned mines and factories throughout the region, calculated at constant 1943 prices, assuming January of last year as 100, was 385.9 in December; it further rose to 458.8 in January of this year, and reached 664.9 in June. Comparing the total output value of the first half of this year with the first half of last year, it exceeded by 292 percent, and it also exceeded the entire year of last year by more than 30 percent. Currently, there are 317 factories and mines that have resumed production under the Northeast Industrial Department system, an increase of more than 60 percent compared to the first half of last year. The total number of employees has increased by 145.8 percent compared to the beginning of last year (excluding military industries and local industries).

The state has invested huge amounts of capital to rapidly restore and develop industry. This year, the Northeast People's Government's planned investment in state-owned industry is two and a half times that of last year, accounting for 40 percent of the government's total annual expenditure, of which investment in the production of means of production accounts for 85 percent. Of the industrial investments last year, according to statistics of completed projects, new construction projects accounted for 24.9 percent, and repair projects accounted for 75.1 percent, while investment in new construction projects this year has greatly exceeded that of last year.

The continuous increase in the means of production is one of the important factors that has promoted the rapid recovery and transformation of Northeast China's state-owned industry. Last year, the production of means of production accounted for 74 percent of the total industrial output value of Northeast China, and it is planned to increase it to 79 percent this year. According to statistics for the first half of this year, the total output value of the production of means of production has exceeded the entire year of last year by 31.5 percent.

The significant improvement of labor productivity has also played an extremely important role in the rapid recovery of Northeast China's mining and manufacturing industries. According to statistics: the average labor productivity of Northeast China's mining and industrial enterprises increased by 32.8 percent in December of last year compared to June of the same year, while the first half of this year was equal to 202 percent of last year. The improvement of labor productivity is a direct result of carrying out the movement to create new production records, establishing production responsibility systems, and strengthening the training and unity of technical personnel.

　　东北国营工矿一年半来进展迅速
    六月份生产总值较去年一月增加五倍半  劳动生产率上半年等于去年百分之二百
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】一年半以来，东北国营工矿业正迅速地进行大规模的恢复建设工作。全区国营工矿的生产总值，以一九四三年的不变价格计算，假定去年一月为一○○，则十二月份为三八五·九；到今年一月份更升至四五八·八，六月份升达六六四·九。如以今年上半年的生产总值与去年上半年比较，超过百分之二百九十二，与去年全年比较也超过了百分之三十强。目前已恢复生产的厂矿，属于东北工业部系统的共有三百十七个，比去年上半年增加了百分之六十以上。职工总数则比去年初增加了百分之一百四十五点八（军工和地方工业在外）。
    国家为迅速恢复和发展工业，已曾投下了巨额资金。今年东北人民政府计划中对国营工业的投资额为去年的二倍半，占政府全年岁出的百分之四十，其中对生产手段的生产的投资占百分之八十五。在工业投资中，去年用于基本建设的投资，据已竣工工程的统计，属于新建工程者占百分之二十四点九，属于修复工程者占百分之七十五点一，而今年的投资中，属于新建工程者已大大超过了去年。
    生产手段的不断增加，是促使东北国营工业迅速恢复和改造的重要因素之一。去年东北工业生产总值中，生产手段的生产占百分之七十四，今年更计划增至百分之七十九。据今年上半年的统计，生产手段的生产总值已超过去年全年的百分之三十一点五。
    劳动生产率的显著提高，对东北工矿业的迅速恢复也起了极重要作用。据统计：东北工矿企业中的平均劳动生产率，去年十二月比同年六月提高了百分之三十二点八，而今年上半年则等于去年的百分之二百零二。劳动生产率的提高，是开展创造生产新纪录运动、建立生产责任制、加强培养和团结技术人员等的直接结果。
