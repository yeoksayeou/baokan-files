　　"Voice of Vietnam" Broadcast Celebrates Fifth Anniversary of August Revolution
    Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth: The Vietnam News Agency reported on the 16th that "Voice of Vietnam" broadcast a message celebrating the fifth anniversary of the August Revolution in Vietnam. The broadcast stated: When Japanese fascists collapsed under the heavy blows of the Soviet Red Army in August 1945, the Vietnamese people stood up, seized power, and ended the rule of the French colonialists. The Vietnamese Communist Party victoriously united all Vietnamese patriots—regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, social status, or religious belief—within a national front and led them to seize power. Inspired by the doctrines of Marx and Lenin, the Vietnamese Communist Party foresaw the defeat of Japanese imperialism when its flames were high and prepared all the conditions for a full-scale uprising. By developing a broad and powerful guerrilla movement to resist French and Japanese oppressors, the Vietnamese Communist Party enabled the August Revolution to achieve national victory. This was aided by the glorious victory of the Soviet army and the subsequent rise of the anti-imperialist and democratic movements worldwide.

　　“越南之声”发表广播
    庆祝八月革命五周年
    【新华社十八日讯】越南通讯社十六日讯：“越南之声”发表广播，庆祝越南八月革命五周年纪念。广播称：当一九四五年八月日本法西斯主义者在苏联红军的严重打击之下崩溃的时候，越南人民挺身而起，夺得了政权，结束了法国殖民者的统治。越南共产党胜利地把越南一切爱国人士——不问其年龄、性别、种族、社会地位、或宗教信仰如何，团结在一个民族战线之内，并领导他们取得政权。在马克思、列宁学说的启发下，越南共产党在日帝国主义凶焰高涨的时候，就已经预见其溃败，并准备了一切的条件，以便全面起义。由于发展了广泛而有力的游击运动以反抗法国和日本压迫者，越南共产党使八月革命得到了全国性的胜利。这是得到了苏军的辉煌胜利以及随后全世界反帝和民主运动高涨的有利的国际条件的帮助的。（“越南八月革命介绍”见第四版。）
