　　Democratic Parties Send Congratulatory Telegrams to the People's Liberation Army to Celebrate August 1st Army Day

To Chairman Mao of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all commanders and fighters:

Today, as the people of the whole country joyfully celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the August 1st Army Day, we, on behalf of all democratic parties, extend our sincerest and highest respects to you!

The Chinese People's Liberation Army has undergone 23 years of arduous war, enabling the Chinese People's Revolution to achieve unprecedented great victories. This people's revolutionary force, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, defeated the barbaric invasion of the Japanese bandits, crushed the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, expelled the imperialists who had invaded China for nearly a hundred years, and destroyed the feudal forces that had exploited the people for more than two thousand years, enabling the Chinese people to establish their own government and lay the foundation for people's democracy. Today's "August 1st" Festival is not only a glorious day in the history of the People's Liberation Army, but also a glorious day in the history of the Chinese nation!

From last year's "August 1st" to this year's "August 1st," thanks to your heroic battles, you have continued to liberate Northwest, Central South, and Southwest China, and the entire China, except for Taiwan and Tibet, has become a free land. Under the wise call of Chairman Mao, you have also assisted in land reform, engaged in labor production, and carried out reclamation, afforestation, road construction, dike construction, flood prevention, disaster relief, and other tasks. Today, you are engaged in improving your military skills and establishing a modern military organization, while also striving to build the nation's navy and air force, and continuously improving your cultural standards. This proves that the People's Liberation Army is not only an absolutely invincible people's force in China's national defense, but also a great and strong force in the world's democratic and peace camp.

On this day when we celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day, the naval fleet of U.S. imperialism dares to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan, attempting to save the dying fate of the U.S. imperialist puppet Chiang bandit gang. U.S. imperialism is also frantically invading Korea with military force and slaughtering the Korean people. U.S. imperialism is also fully supporting the reactionary regimes in Vietnam, the Philippines... to oppress our Asian people and obstruct the independence and liberation movements of our Asian nations. This overbearing and brutal behavior of U.S. imperialism is an attempt to provoke a world war in order to achieve the goal of dominating Asia and dominating the world.

This blind and adventurous behavior of U.S. imperialism has only aroused the anger of our Asian people and strengthened our resistance to the invaders. The brilliant victories achieved by the Korean people in the anti-aggression war over the past month have given U.S. imperialism a serious lesson. The victory of the Korean People's Army is the glory of the Korean people and a great encouragement to the independence and liberation movements of our Asian nations! At this moment, our People's Liberation Army is universally issuing the angry roar of defending the homeland:

"We must liberate Taiwan from the hands of the U.S. imperialist aggressors!"

This majestic call has inspired the whole of China, Asia, and the world!

We, the democratic parties, on this glorious day of "August 1st," express our full confidence and heartfelt admiration for the People's Liberation Army's iron will to defend the motherland. We thank you for your 23 years of revolutionary hard work, and we wish you more victories, greater success, and greater glory!

Let us shout: Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!  Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

　　各民主党派为庆祝八一建军节
    向解放军致贺电
    【新华社一日讯】各民主党派为庆祝“八一”建军节向中国人民解放军致贺电文中国人民革命军事委员会毛主席，中国人民解放军朱总司令暨全体指挥员战斗员：
    在全国人民欢欣鼓舞庆祝“八一”建军节二十三周年的今天，我们谨代表各民主党派向你们致最诚挚最崇高的敬礼！
    中国人民解放军经历了二十三年来的艰苦战争，使中国的人民革命，获得了史无前例的伟大胜利。这一支人民革命武力，由于毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导，击溃了日本强盗的野蛮侵略，打垮了蒋介石匪帮的反动统治，驱逐了近百年来侵略中国的帝国主义，摧毁了二千余年来剥削人民的封建势力，使中国人民建立了自己的政权，奠定了人民民主的基础。今天的“八一”节不止是人民解放军历史上的光荣日子，也是中华民族历史上的光荣日子！
    从去年“八一”到今年“八一”，这一年来，由于你们的英勇战斗，继续解放了中国的西北、中南和西南，整个中国除台湾和西藏外，完全成了自由的国土。在毛主席英明号召之下，你们又协助了土地改革进行了劳动生产，展开了垦荒、植林、修路、筑堤、防洪、救灾等项工作。你们今天正从事增进自己的军事技能，树立了现代化的军事组织规模，同时还努力建立了国家的海空军，并不断提高自己的文化水准。这证明人民解放军不仅是中国国防上绝对不可征服的人民队伍，而且是世界民主和平阵营中一个伟大坚强的力量。
    在我们庆祝“八一”建军节的今天，美帝国主义的海军舰队竟胆敢阻挠我们解放台湾，企图挽救美帝傀儡蒋匪帮的垂死命运。美帝今天还正在疯狂地用武力侵略朝鲜，屠杀朝鲜人民。美帝今天还在全力支持越南、菲律宾……等地的反动政权以压迫我们亚洲人民而阻挠我们亚洲各民族的独立解放运动。美帝国主义这种专横残暴的行为，是妄图挑起世界大战，以达到统治亚洲，称霸世界的目的。
    美帝国主义这种盲目冒险行为只是激动了我们亚洲人民的愤怒，增强了我们对侵略者的抵抗。一个月来朝鲜人民在反侵略战争中获得的辉煌胜利，已给予美帝严重的教训。朝鲜人民军这种胜利是朝鲜人民的光荣，也是我们亚洲各民族独立解放运动的一种极大的鼓励！就在这个时候，我们的人民解放军正普遍地发出了捍卫国土的怒吼：
    “我们必定从美帝侵略者手中解放台湾！”
    这雄壮的呼声，鼓舞了全中国、全亚洲和全世界！
    我们各民主党派，在今天这个“八一”光荣的日子，对人民解放军这种保卫祖国的钢铁意志，表示充分信赖与衷心的敬佩。我们感谢你们二十三年来革命的辛劳，我们预祝你们获得更多的胜利，更大的成功，更高的光荣！
    让我们高呼：中国人民解放军万岁！朱总司令万岁！毛主席万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！中国人民大团结万岁！世界人民大团结万岁！
