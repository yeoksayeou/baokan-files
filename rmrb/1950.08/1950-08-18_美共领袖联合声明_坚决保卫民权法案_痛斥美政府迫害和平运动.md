Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 16th, TASS dispatch from New York, August 13th: In order to suppress the movement for peace and against the U.S. aggression in Korea, the American reactionaries have launched a brutal campaign of intimidation, wantonly using every means available, resorting to direct violence and arresting peace fighters. Recently, the arrest and vicious beating of peace advocates has become more and more frequent.

According to reports from the Compass Daily and the New York Times from New Jersey, four workers at a General Motors factory were fired for distributing leaflets calling for "non-interference in Korea." Two of them were brutally beaten and imprisoned, and are now threatened with ten years in jail.

The New York Times reported that New York police arrested two women collecting signatures for the Stockholm Appeal and fined them $50 each. They were charged with "disorderly conduct."

The New York Post reported from Philadelphia that police arrested eleven people in a home after finding peace declarations and a copy of the Daily Worker, using prevention as a pretext.

The Progressive Party's organ, the National Guardian, cited many examples of peace fighters being arrested and beaten. In Burbank, California, police arrested three women for distributing leaflets protesting U.S. aggression in Korea. In Vancouver, Washington, a 67-year-old woman was arrested for collecting signatures for the Stockholm Appeal. In the Nash Motors factory in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, about twenty fascist thugs brutally beat eight workers who had signed the Stockholm Appeal. As a result, one person's spine was broken.

    痛斥美政府迫害和平运动
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：美国反动派为了压制争取和平及反对美国侵略朝鲜的运动，已发动凶暴的恫吓攻势，肆意利用一切可以利用的方法，并诉诸直接暴力行为和逮捕和平战士的手段。最近，逮捕及凶恶殴打和平拥护者的事情越来越频繁了。
    据指南针日报及纽约时报的新泽西州消息说，通用汽车厂四名工人因为散发要求“不干涉朝鲜”的传单而被开除。其中两人被凶残地殴击和被投入狱中，现在并被威胁要坐牢十年。
    纽约时报报道：纽约警察逮捕了两个为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的妇女，每人并被罚款五十元。她们被控“违犯秩序”。
    纽约邮报从费城报道，警察在一家中发现和平宣言及一份工人日报后，以预防为借口逮捕了十一人。
    进步党机关刊国民前卫引证许多和平战士被捕及被殴的例子。在加利福尼亚州的白班克警察逮捕了三名妇女，因为她们散发抗议美国侵略朝鲜的传单。在华盛顿州的温哥华有六十七岁的老妪被捕，因为她为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名。在威斯康星州密尔窝基的那希汽车工厂中，法西斯恶徒约二十人凶残地殴打在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名的八个工人。结果，有一人的脊椎骨被打断。
