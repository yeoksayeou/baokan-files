Xinhua News Agency, August 9th Dispatch from London: The first meeting of the North Atlantic Group Assistant Foreign Ministers, which began in London on July 25th, adjourned on August 4th. The communiqué issued after the meeting stated that the North Atlantic Group would intensify its war preparations. The communiqué said, "The defenses (i.e., war preparations) of the North Atlantic region must be strengthened rapidly, and it was agreed to recommend to the governments of the North Atlantic Treaty countries that they increase the effective military strength for common defense." The communiqué revealed that the North Atlantic Group Assistant Foreign Ministers meeting would become an institution for the United States to supervise the war preparation plans of various countries. The communiqué said, "The representatives have given the institutions of the North Atlantic Treaty a task to formulate a plan to increase and accelerate the production of a number of high-priority munitions. To this end, the institutions should submit recommendations to the Assistant Foreign Ministers this month. The Assistant Foreign Ministers will immediately consult with their respective governments to promote the plan to strengthen military strength." The communiqué also acknowledged that this expansion plan was out of the compulsory requirements of the United States. The communiqué said: "The United States representative informed the representatives of the measures taken by the United States government to increase military establishment and the additional military aid plan proposed by President Truman. The representatives expressed their gratitude for these measures and noted with satisfaction that other governments are also taking steps to strengthen their defense efforts."

The communiqué emphasized that the central task of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc's current war preparations is to establish and strengthen the so-called "balanced collective army," believing that this is the "best way" to invade. According to the Associated Press, the meeting began discussing the plan to establish this army the next day, attempting to extract a portion of armed forces from Western European countries to form an international army specifically for aggression. To this end, the Standing Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Military Committee, composed of representatives of the Chiefs of Staff of the United States, Britain, and France, also came from Washington on August 1st to participate in the meeting to consider the issue of appointing the supreme commander of this aggressive army.

The meeting was held in extreme secrecy, but according to United Press, the United States still encountered great difficulties in planning its aggressive forces. The United States had requested its servant countries to send troops to Korea at the meeting, but France instead demanded that the United States increase its troops stationed in Western Europe. The United States demanded the establishment of an aggressive army in West Germany, but France demanded that West Germany bear more occupation costs. Therefore, the meeting did not make much progress in the militarization of West Germany. According to Agence France-Presse, when French representative Alphand was asked by reporters on the 7th whether West Germany would participate in the joint military consolidation and whether the restrictions on West Germany's military industrial production would be relaxed, he said that the issue of West Germany's participation in the military consolidation had not been raised, and the restrictions on West Germany's military industrial production were currently "not intended to be modified."

　　北大西洋集团外长助理会首次会结束
    美帝胁迫各国加紧备战
    筹划侵略兵力时美帝遭到极大困难
    【新华社九日讯】伦敦消息：自七月二十五日起在伦敦举行的北大西洋集团外长助理会议首次会议，已于八月四日休会。会后发表的公报表示：北大西洋集团将加紧备战活动。公报说：“必须迅速加强北大西洋区域的防务（按即战争准备），并同意向北大西洋公约各国政府建议，请它们增加共同防务的有效军力。”公报透露北大西洋集团外长助理会议今后将成为美国监督各国进行备战计划的一个机构，公报说：“各代表已给北大西洋公约各机构以一种任务，要它们制定一个增加并加速若干有高度优先权的军火生产的计划。各机构为此应在本月内向外长助理会议提出建议。各外长助理当即咨询各该国政府，以促进增强军力的计划。”公报又承认这个扩军计划是出于美国的强迫要求，公报说：“美国代表把美国政府所采取的增加军事编制和杜鲁门总统所提出的额外军事援助计划通知了各国代表。代表们均表示他们感谢这些措施，并满意地指出，其他各国政府也正在采取步骤以加强它们的防务努力。”
    公报强调北大西洋侵略集团目前备战的中心任务是建立并加强所谓“均衡的集体军队”，认为这是侵略的“最好方法”。据美联社消息：会议在第二天就着手讨论了成立这支军队的计划，企图从西欧各国中抽取一部分武装部队，以组成专供侵略之用的国际军队。为此，由美、英、法三国参谋总长代表组成的北大西洋公约军事委员会常设委员会，并特于八月一日自华盛顿前来参加会议，考虑任命这一支侵略军的最高统帅的问题。
    会议是在极端秘密的情况下举行的，但是，据合众社透露：美国在筹划其侵略兵力时，依然遭到极大的困难。美国曾在会上要求其仆从国家出兵朝鲜，但是，法国却反而要求美国增加其西欧驻军。美国要求在西德成立侵略军，法国却要求西德负担更多的占领费用。因此，会议在西德军事化方面并没有获得多大进展。据法新社称：法国代表阿尔芳七日在回答记者所问西德是否参加共同整军，西德军事工业生产的限制是否要放宽的问题时说：目前还没有提出西德参加整军的问题，西德军事工业生产的限制目前也还“无意修改”。
