　　Anhui North Flood Victims
    Seed Replenishment Basically Resolved
    【Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th】The difficulty for flood victims in northern Anhui province in lacking seeds for replanting late autumn crops has been basically resolved. As of the 17th of this month, the four purchasing teams of the Central People's Government have purchased buckwheat totaling 6 million jin, turnip greens 3.39 million jin, rutabaga 130,000 jin, carrots 77,000 jin, potatoes 2 million jin, and cabbage seeds 100,000 jin from Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, and Henan provinces. These have all begun or are about to begin shipping, and a small portion is still being purchased. In addition to the seeds purchased by the Anhui North Administrative Office itself, this is enough for flood victims in Anhui North to rush-plant 13 million mu of late autumn crops. More than 3.4 million jin of the purchased seeds have already been transported to the disaster areas by the Huai River Navigation Bureau before the 13th. The Anhui North People's Administrative Office issued a notice on the 17th, ordering all special administrative offices to accelerate the receipt of seeds, and instructing local staff to immediately distribute the delivered seeds to flood victims and investigate the planting habits of the masses, introducing good planting methods to the flood victims.
