Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 10th. Chongqing's campaign to collect signatures for the defense of world peace has achieved some results and gained some experience. The city's signature campaign began on May 23 and tentatively ended on May 31. Within seven days, 939,849 people signed, accounting for 78 percent of the city's total population of 1.2 million.

The rapid development of this signature campaign was primarily due to the Chongqing leadership's emphasis on this work, closely integrating general appeals and mobilizations with specific organizational efforts. While the Chongqing branch of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued its peace declaration, Party committees at all levels had already conducted propaganda, mobilization, and organizational work for the signature campaign. The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee convened cadres from various systems and regional Party committees and propaganda departments to explain the great significance of the signature campaign and stipulated unified propaganda points and slogans. In organizing and mobilizing the masses, a method of cooperation between various systems and regions was adopted to avoid omissions and repetitions.

Secondly, the Chongqing Peace Signature Committee utilized the strength of the masses and activists, and united various democratic parties and local figures to work together. Peace signature campaign committees and other organizations were generally established in various regions, organs, factories, and schools. The committees in various regions absorbed local figures with prestige among the masses to work together. In the urban area alone, seven committees, 98 signature stations, and 143 signature groups were established. On average, there was one signature station for every 300 households, and one signature group was assigned to every 100 households. In addition, more than 10,000 workers and students participated in this work. In the Beibei district, more than 5,000 students and workers participated in propaganda activities. They organized 104 propaganda teams and 186 visiting teams to conduct propaganda separately. A large number of activists emerged during the signature campaign. After understanding the significance of the signature campaign, Wang Youhe, a citizen of New Third District, mobilized 3,638 people to sign. Various democratic parties and people's organizations also actively participated in this work. The number of people they mobilized to sign reached more than 100,000.

Thirdly, various different methods of propaganda and mobilization were adopted to carry out widespread and in-depth propaganda. In addition to general propaganda using slogans, cartoons, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, radio broadcasts, songs, dances, short plays, seminars, and lectures, the methods of holding mass rallies and conducting family visits were also adopted, which achieved great results. For example, 105 mass rallies were held in the urban area, with a total of 300,000 people attending. Many people signed up during the propaganda.

In addition, the guiding organs of the signature campaign specifically assigned people to monitor the telephone, report the situation every day, exchange experiences and correct shortcomings at any time, which played a significant role in promoting the signature campaign.

Chongqing's peace signature campaign has not only enhanced the Chongqing citizens' understanding of the international situation and the defense of world peace, but also laid a broad foundation for future propaganda and mobilization work among the people.

　　重庆推进和平签名运动
    周密组织宣传并运用积极分子力量  全市签名者近人口总数百分之八十
    【新华社重庆十日电】重庆市的保卫世界和平签名运动已获得一些成绩和经验。该市签名运动从五月二十三日开始，至三十一日初步结束。七天内签名者达九十三万九千八百四十九人，占全市人口总数一百二十万人的百分之七十八。
    这次签名运动所以能迅速地得到很大发展，首先是因为重庆领导机关重视这个工作，并使一般的号召、动员和具体的组织工作密切结合。在成立中国保卫世界和平大会重庆分会发出和平宣言的同时，中共各级党委就已进行了签名运动的宣传动员和组织工作的布置。市委宣传部召集各系统各区域党委及宣传部门干部开会说明签名运动的伟大意义，并规定了统一的宣传要点与标语口号。在组织和发动群众方面，采取了各个系统与各个区域配合进行的办法，以避免遗漏和重复。
    其次重庆和平签名委员会是运用了群众和积极分子的力量，并团结了各民主党派及地方人士共同工作。各区域和各机关、工厂、学校普遍成立了和平签名运动委员会等组织，各区域的委员会都吸收了在群众中有威望的地方人士一道工作。仅城区即成立了七个委员会，九十八个签名站，一百四十三个签名组，平均约三百户就设有一个签名站，一百户就可分配到一个签名组。此外并有一万多工人和学生参加了这一工作。北碚区有五千多学生和工人参加宣传活动。他们组织了一百零四个宣传队，一百八十六个访问队，分头进行宣传。在签名运动中积极分子大批产生。新三区市民汪幼鹤在了解了签名运动意义以后，一个人发动了三千六百三十八人签名。各民主党派和人民团体也积极地参加了这个工作。经他们发动签名的人数达十万余人。
    第三是采用了各种不同的宣传鼓动方式，普遍深入地进行了宣传。除了以标语、漫画、壁报、黑板报、广播、歌咏、舞蹈、短剧、座谈、讲演等方式进行一般宣传外，并采用开群众大会和进行家庭访问的方式，收到了很大效果。如城区召开群众大会一百零五次，到会群众共达三十万人，在宣传中即征集了很多人签名。
    此外签名运动的指导机关专门设人掌握电话，每天汇报情况，随时交流经验和纠正缺点，对推动签名运动起了很大作用。
    重庆市的这次和平签名运动不仅把重庆市民群众对国际形势及保卫世界和平的认识提高了一步，而且还给今后对人民群众的宣传鼓动工作打下了广阔的基础。
