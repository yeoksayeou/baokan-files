　　Model Technician Wang Yazhou
    Comrade Wang Yazhou is the head technician of the calcium carbide plant at the Jilin State-Owned Chemical Factory and a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party. He is forty years old this year. Because his family was very poor when he was young, he only studied for two years. At the age of twelve, he herded pigs and did heavy work for landlords. At the age of thirty (1940), he switched to being a miner. At the age of thirty-one (1941), he went to the Qinghai-cho chemical factory in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, to study for half a year. In October of the same year, he returned to the factory's calcium carbide furnace as a technician. After the liberation of Jilin in March 1948, under the education of the Party, he has consistently been conscientious and responsible in his work and has been able to find ways to overcome difficulties. In particular, Comrade Wang Yazhou has made outstanding achievements in solving specific technical problems. For example, when the calcium carbide furnace was undergoing a raw material ratio quota test in February of this year, the temperature of the furnace suddenly became too high, and molten iron flowed out of the furnace for seven or eight hours. If the molten iron flowed between the refractory bricks and the iron plate, the entire furnace body would be in danger of being burned. At that time, everyone felt helpless and had to stop work for repairs. Stopping work for repairs would take at least seven days. If the repair costs and the loss of calcium carbide production during the shutdown period were calculated together, the loss would be around 1 billion Northeast currency. After careful study by Comrade Wang Yazhou, he found the cause of the problem: too many impurities in the coke. He quickly replaced the prepared coke, finally avoiding this major accident.
    Due to Comrade Wang Yazhou's many years of rich technical experience and a high degree of responsibility, another major accident was avoided. In March, too many impurities accumulated at the bottom of the furnace, and the furnace eye could not be opened, so calcium carbide could not flow out. The only remedy was not to fill the raw materials and blast the eye, but doing so would inevitably increase the firepower at the furnace mouth, the rubber hose would definitely be burned, and the furnace body would explode. Another way was to cut off the power. But cutting off the power would affect four or five days of production. At this time, Comrade Wang Yazhou came up with a proper solution. He used asbestos tiles to hang on the rubber hose to isolate it from the fire mouth (asbestos tiles are fireproof), and it took more than three hours to melt and discharge the hard bottom of impurities at the bottom of the furnace. In June of this year, several accidents of broken electrodes and short circuits (several electrodes were too close to the upper end, and the intermediate distance material was not well installed) occurred successively in the factory, all of which were turned into safety under the resourceful and decisive handling of Comrade Wang Yazhou.
    For the past two years, Comrade Wang has consistently treated his work with a selfless spirit, without absenteeism or leave, and never caring about personal gains or losses. Especially during the period when accidents occurred in the factory, he did not go home day and night for two to seven days, and his wife brought him food. He stayed up so late that his eyes were red. He continued to study like this until the accident was completely eliminated.
    Comrade Wang Yazhou has always been very modest in his work style and in his business and cultural studies. He often leads everyone to hold meetings to discuss how to produce savings and improve technology. He does not have the airs of a master at all. He can patiently teach others all the technical experience he has. For example, when discharging the furnace, the new workers used the iron bars improperly. He taught the workers how to aim the tip of the iron bar at the concave part of the furnace eye, hold it firmly and shake it lightly, the power is quickly turned on, the calcium carbide flows out quickly, and the quality is also good. In addition, he also took the initiative to find work to do. In January of this year, the product was increasing day by day, and there were few packaging workers. Comrade Wang was afraid that the calcium carbide would be weathered and the country's wealth would be lost. Therefore, he advocated processing for one hour after each shift, and 30 tons of calcium carbide were quickly packaged. He saw that the workers were wearing out a pair of gloves in five days, which was too wasteful, so he automatically advocated saving. Later, a pair was not worn out for twenty days.
    Comrade Wang only studied for two years when he was a child, and he worked hard to learn culture after liberation. Now he has learned more than 500 characters. During his rest, he either reads the newspaper or practices writing in a small notebook. His humble study of business and learning culture has played a great role in the country's production and construction. Therefore, he has won the honorary title of first-class labor model five times in a row.

　　模范技工王亚洲
    王亚洲同志是吉林国营化学工厂电石厂的技工长，中共正式党员。他今年四十岁，小时因他家很穷，只念过二年书。十二岁就给地主放猪扛活。三十岁时（一九四○年）转业当矿工。三十一岁（一九四一年）那年曾去日本新泻县青海町化工厂学习了半年，同年十月回本厂电石炉做技工。一九四八年三月吉林解放后，他在党的教育下，工作一贯认真负责，并能想法克服困难。特别是在解决具体的技术问题上，王亚洲同志做出了卓越的成绩。如今年二月电石炉作原料配比定额试验时，炉的热度忽然过高，并从炉内往外流铁水达七八个钟头之久，若铁水流入耐火砖与铁板中间去，整个炉体就有被烧毁的危险。当时大家感到束手无策，只有停工修理。而停工修理至少需要七天，如把修理费和停工期电石生产的损失一并计算，其所受损失当在东北币十亿元左右。经过王亚洲同志的仔细研究后，找出了发生毛病的原因：焦子杂质太多。他便很快地更换了配好的焦子，终于避免了这一重大事故的发生。
    由于王亚洲同志多年丰富的技术经验与高度的负责精神，又避免了另一重大事故的发生。三月间，炉底积压杂质太多，炉眼打不开，电石流不出。唯一补救的办法是不填原料、崩眼，但这样做炉口的火力势必加大起来，胶皮管定被烧坏，炉体就会发生爆炸，再一个办法是停电。而停电就会影响四五天的生产。这时，王亚洲同志想出了妥善办法。他用石棉瓦吊在胶皮管上与火口隔绝（石棉瓦能防火），经三个多钟头才把炉底杂质硬底溶化排出。今年六月，厂内又相继发生数次折断电极和连电（数根电着上端距离太近，中间距离物未很好装置）的事故，都在王亚洲同志的机智果断处理下，化险为夷。
    两年来，王同志一贯以忘我的精神对待自己的工作，不旷工不请假，从不计较个人的得失。特别是在工厂发生事故的期间，他竟有两天到七天的时间日夜不回家，由老婆给他送饭吃。他由于睡觉时间太少，把眼都熬红了。他这样不断研究，一直到彻底消灭事故为止。
    王亚洲同志在工作作风上，以及在业务、文化学习上一向是很虚心的，他经常领导大家开会，讨论如何生产节约，提高技术。他没有一点师傅架子，凡是他会的技术经验，都能很耐心的教给别人。如出炉时，新工友使用铁筋不适当，他教工友们如何将铁筋尖端对准炉眼凹处，顶住用力轻摇，通电快，电石流出也快，而且质量还好。此外，他还主动的找工作做，今年一月间，产品日益加多，包装的工友少，王同志怕电石被风化了，会损失国家财富，因而倡导在每次下班后加工一小时，很快便包装完三十吨电石。他看到工友们五天用坏一付手套，太浪费，他便自动的提倡节约。到后来，二十天还用不坏一付。
    王同志小时只念过二年书，解放后他就努力学习文化。现在已学会五百多个生字了。他在休息时不是看报，就是在小本子上练习写字。他这样的虚心钻研业务、学习文化，在祖国的生产建设中发挥了极大的力量。因此，他曾连获五次头等劳动模范的光荣称号。
