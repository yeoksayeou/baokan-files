　　Xinhua News Agency, August 29th Dispatch: According to comprehensive TASS news, Soviet workers are using new production methods to deeply unfold the "Peace Work Team" movement.

　　In Moscow, tens of thousands of Stakhanovite workers participating in the "Peace Work Team" have put forward guarantees to increase productivity and complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule. The "Hammer and Sickle" factory produces hundreds of tons of steel above the plan every day. A group of workers has produced an average of 19 tons of steel per square meter of open-hearth furnace bottom, reaching the highest output in the world. The "Red Proletarian" factory has increased the production speed of lathes and machine parts by 50% compared to normal by adopting accelerated metal cutting methods.

　　The machine and tool manufacturing plants in Leningrad have widely adopted the high-speed parts manufacturing method of Boltkevich, a Stalin Prize winner and famous turner, with all workers achieving a metal cutting speed of 700 meters per minute. During the "Peace Work Team" period, their output has approximately doubled. Isayev, a worker at the Ilyich factory, was the first to use high-speed methods to increase the rate of large drilling machines by five times, and other workers are learning from him one after another.

　　At the Gubishev rolling metal factory in Kramatorsk, Ukrainian Republic, the entire Kiriyev family participated in the "Peace Work Team." They made many suggestions for improving the design of the rolling mill, which more than doubled the production capacity of the rolling mill. Sergei Kiriyev alone put forward 20 rationalization proposals, saving the factory one million rubles annually.

    莫斯科数万先进工人保证提前完成全年计划
    参加“和平工作班”工人提出很多合理化建议
    【新华社二十九日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联的工人正以新的生产方法，深入展开“和平工作班”运动。
    在莫斯科，数万名参加了“和平工作班”的斯塔哈诺夫式工人，已提出增加生产率并提前完成全年生产计划的保证。“锤子与镰刀”工厂每天都超计划生产数百吨钢。一批工人已在每平方公尺的平炉炉底平均生产了十九吨钢，达到了全世界的最高产量。“红色无产者”工厂由于采用了金属切割加速法，已使车床和机器零件的生产速度较平时增加了百分之五十。
    列宁格勒各机器与工具制造厂，已广泛地采用了斯大林奖金得奖人、著名旋工波尔特克维奇的高速制造零件的方法，一切工人的切割金属的速率都达到了每分钟七百公尺。在“和平工作班”期间，他们的产量约提高了一倍。伊里奇工厂的工人伊萨耶夫，首先用高速方法使大钻孔机的速率提高了五倍，其他的工人都纷纷向他学习。
    在乌克兰共和国克拉马托尔斯克的古比雪夫辗金属工厂，基里也夫全家三人都参加了“和平工作班”，他们曾对辗机的设计提出了许多改进的意见，使辗机的生产能力提高一倍以上。单是塞尔盖·基里也夫一个人就提出了二十个合理化建议，使工厂每年节省了一百万卢布。
