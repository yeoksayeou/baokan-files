Rescuing During Floods, Strengthening and Solidifying After Floods
XinYi River Safely Weathers Four Floods
Intensifying Preparations to Meet the Test of a Major Flood

[This newspaper reported] The XinYi River has continuously overcome four floods from July 5th to August 10th. The first flood occurred on July 5th, with a flow rate of over 800 cubic meters per second; the second was on July 17th, with a flow rate of 924 cubic meters per second; the third was on August 3rd, with a flow rate of 1,447 cubic meters per second; and the fourth was on August 10th, with a flow rate of 698 cubic meters per second. However, all four floods did not exceed one-half of the river's maximum flow rate of 3,200 cubic meters per second.

During each flood season, the XinYi River exposed some shortcomings and dangers to varying degrees. However, repairs were carried out while fighting the floods, and additional repairs were made after the floods receded. After several heavy rains, the dikes became saturated, so the solidity was continually strengthened, gradually consolidating the dikes and reducing the dangers. From the beginning of July to August 15th (during the four flood periods), more than 251,350 workers were mobilized, completing more than 440,000 cubic meters of repair work, including cutting away obstacles and shoal surfaces in the river channel and repairing rain-eroded gullies, as well as 3.2 million square meters of ramming. For example, during the initial flood, the river dikes had many boundary ditches, sinkholes, and cracks. The south dike of Xiguan in Shuyang County, due to the impact of the main current, had a slope toe collapse of three meters wide and over 200 meters long, with more than 30 breaches. All were urgently repaired, and no accidents occurred. During the second flood, only a dozen breaches of varying sizes occurred. Thanks to adequate preparation and rapid blocking, the situation was turned from danger to safety. During the third flood, there were no breaches. Only a few sandy soil dikes were eroded, and more than 30 windbreak structures were installed at the bends facing the current where dangers occurred, safely passing the test of a larger flood. The fourth flood passed safely due to the small flow rate.

Based on the four instances of water flow and future flood control requirements, the XinYi River still has four urgent problems to solve: (1) The Zhangshan in the upper reaches and the Haikou shoal in the lower reaches are both too high and must be excavated. The middle channel opening of the Zhangshan ridge cutting is high. The original design of the project was to accommodate a flow rate of 710 cubic meters per second from the Yi River, but now it can only handle about 300 cubic meters. At Haikou, the shoal is more than one meter high, and the diverted river is narrow and straight, with the water flow area only accounting for one-seventeenth of the river's width (3,500 meters), obstructing water flow. (2) The height and width of some dikes in Shuyang and Guanyun counties are insufficient and must be continuously raised and thickened. For example, the 20-kilometer-long eastern dike of the Xiaochao River in Guanyun County is generally only about three meters high (originally planned to be four meters high). In some places, the riverbed water depth reached 2.1 meters during the second water flow. If the water level rises further, there is a risk of breaching. (3) The part of the north dike of the Yunhe River below the Zhongyun River dam that is scoured by the main current, because the dike is steep and the flow is turbulent, and the stone revetment has collapsed, urgently requires 3,000 cubic meters of stone to continue emergency repairs. (4) Preventing wind and waves is the most serious problem on the XinYi River. The key areas are Luoma Lake, the eastern part of the Xiaochao River in Guanyun County, and the flood control section east of Shuyang City. Even a slight breeze on Luoma Lake can create waves two or three Chinese feet high. Strengthening the laying of random stones on the slopes and building windbreak structures is an urgent measure to defend against wind and waves and consolidate the lake dikes.

The above four dangerous sections and projects are being urgently repaired and excavated. The 20-kilometer-long windbreak structure, mat laying, and other projects on the northeastern dike of the Xiaochao River have been largely completed. Based on the experience of the four water flows, flood control materials have been prepared to meet a flow rate of more than 3,200 cubic meters, and they have been concentrated in each dangerous section for local use in case of emergency.

Due to the small size of the four water flows, all of which were successfully passed, and the continuous tense emergency repairs before, during, and after the floods, many flood control personnel have developed a sense of boredom, paralysis, and relaxation towards flood control work. This is something that leadership should pay special attention to.

Starting from the 16th of this month, heavy rains have fallen extensively in Shandong Province, and the Yi River and Shu River in the upper reaches of the XinYi River in northern Jiangsu Province have both risen. The major flood is imminent. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity, overcome paralysis and slackness, strengthen preparations, meet the test of the maximum flow rate, and ensure this year's bumper harvest in northern Jiangsu.

　　汛到抢险汛后加修硪实
    新沂河安度四次洪水
    现正加强准备迎接大汛考验
    【本报讯】新沂河自七月五日到本月十日，已连续战胜四次洪水。初汛是七月五日，流量为八百余秒立方公尺；第二次是七月十七日，流量为九百二十四秒立方公尺；第三次是八月三日，流量为一千四百四十七秒立方公尺；第四次是八月十日，流量为六百九十八秒立方公尺。但四次洪水均未超过该河最大流量三千二百秒公方的二分之一。
    新沂河在每次的汛期中，都或多或少的暴露了缺点和险象，但每次洪水到来时边抢边修，汛退后又加工修补，几次大雨后堤身侵润，继续加工硪实，已使堤身日渐巩固，险象减少。计从七月初旬至八月十五日（四次汛期）四十余天中，动员了民工二十五万一千三百五十余人，完成了切除河心障碍滩面以及修填雨淋沟等修补工程四十四万余公方，打硪三百二十万余平方。如河堤在初汛时，界沟、陷塘、裂缝极多；沭阳西关南堤因受主流冲击，坡脚坍塌三公尺宽，二百余公尺长，漏洞三十余处，均经紧急抢修，没有出险。第二次汛时，只发生了十余处大小漏洞，由于准备充分，迅速抢堵，亦转危为安。第三次汛时已无漏洞，仅有少数沙土堤身被冲蚀，并在坐湾迎流发生险象处完成打桩下防风埽三十余处后，安全度过了较大的洪水考验。第四次汛期因流量小，平安度过。
    根据四次行水情况及今后防汛要求，目前新沂河仍有四个问题急须解决：（一）上游嶂山和下游海口滩高，均须开挖。嶂山切岭的中泓上口地势高，工程原施工设计容沂水七百一十秒公方流量，而现在实际只能行三百个左右流量，海口处也因滩高一公尺多，引河狭直，能行水地方只占河面宽（三千五百公尺）十七分之一，阻碍水流。（二）沭阳、灌云两县部分堤的高、宽度不足，须继续加高培厚。如灌云县小潮河东二十公里长，一般堤高仅三公尺左右（原计划做四公尺高），有的地方在二次行水时，河床水深已达二·一公尺，如水位再提高，则易发生漫决危险。（三）中运河坝下运河北堤脚受主流冲刷部分，因堤身陡立，流势汹涌，石戗坍塌，急须以三千公方石继续抢做。（四）防风浪是新沂河上最严重问题，重点是在骆马湖、灌云县小潮河东，及沭阳城东防汛段。骆马湖微风即有二三华尺高浪头。加强乱石铺坡，做防风埽打关埽桩，是当前防御风浪、巩固湖堤的紧要办法。
    以上四处险段与工程正在加紧抢修、开挖中。小潮河东北堤二十公里防风埽、铺席等工程已大部完成。根据四次行水经验，已作出迎接三千二百余流量的防汛器材准备，并已集中每个险工段，以备紧急出险时就地取用。
    由于四次行水不大，均胜利度过，同时又在汛前汛后及临汛时不断紧张的抢修加工，不少防汛人员对防汛工作已产生厌倦、麻痹、松懈情绪，这是值得领导上特别注意的。
    本月十六日起，山东境已普降大雨，苏北新沂河上游的沂河、沭河均告上涨，大汛即到。因此应特别抓紧时机，克服麻痹松懈，加强准备，迎接最大流量的考验，确保苏北今年的丰收。
