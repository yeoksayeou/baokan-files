Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Youth League organizations in the flood-stricken areas along the Huai River in northern Anhui, under the leadership of the local People's Government and the Communist Party, actively mobilized League members and youth to participate in flood control and disaster relief work. Many League members played the role of shock troops in the work.

Youth League members and young people have become an important force in flood control. For example, in Wuhe County, more than 10,000 young people participated in the flood control work at 22 dangerous spots on the Huai embankment, accounting for more than half of all flood control laborers. In Jin'gangzui Township of the county, all 37 Youth League members were involved in the flood control movement. Youth League members demonstrated a spirit of fearless heroism in flood control work. For example, after a sluice gate on the Changshan County Tang River in Suxi County was broken by the flood, Chen Yongchang, deputy secretary of the township Youth League branch (and village chief of Da Xu Village), immediately led 53 laborers to rescue it. When the laborers saw the ferocity of the flood, they were afraid to go into the water. Chen Yongchang took the lead and jumped into the water, using his body to block the breach in the stone gate. The laborers were moved by his bravery and all went into the water to rescue it. That night it rained heavily again. Chen Yongchang immediately led two militiamen (Youth League members) to patrol the river embankment in the rain and found a small hole in the original breach. Because they were unable to spare anyone to go back to call for help, they all jumped into the water to block the hole with their bodies and spent the night in the wind and rain until someone came to repair the breach at dawn. Thanks to their selfless efforts, more than 15,000 mu of crops nearby were spared from flooding.

In the already flooded areas, Youth League members worked with local farmers to dig ditches, drain water, and save or replant seedlings. After the Laolongwa area of Fantai Township, Yingshang County, was flooded, 179 League members in the township cooperated with local farmers to dig 12 ditches in two days under the leadership of township cadres, draining all the water and saving more than 1,000 mu of crops. When replanting, Li Kaiqing, secretary of the Youth League branch, led League members in taking the lead in replanting, and League members also helped military families and people lacking labor to cultivate the land.

In the disaster areas, Youth League members mobilized young people and the masses to overcome pessimistic emotions and actively engage in production for self-relief. At the same time, Youth League members also became a powerful assistant to the local Communist Party and the People's Government in participating in relief and resettlement of disaster victims.

　　淮河沿岸各地青年团员
    奋不顾身带头救水灾
    【本报讯】据新华社消息：皖北淮河沿岸遭受水灾地区的青年团组织，在当地人民政府和共产党的领导下，积极发动团员和青年参加抢险救灾工作，很多团员在工作中起了突击队的作用。
    青年团员和青年们在抢险工作中，成为一支重要的力量。如五河县一万余青年参加淮堤二十二个险工处的抢险工作，占全体抢险民工一半以上。该县金岗嘴一个乡三十七名青年团员全部投入抢险运动。青年团员在抢险工作中，表现了大无畏的英勇精神。如宿西县常山县塘河的一个闸口，被大水冲破后，该乡青年团支部副书记（兼大徐村村长）陈永昌，立即带领五十三个民工前去抢救。民工看到水势凶猛，不敢下水，陈永昌就首先跳到水里，用身体堵住石闸破口。民工们被他的勇敢精神所感动。全体下水抢救。当夜又下大雨。陈永昌马上又带领两个民兵（青年团员）冒雨到河堤巡视，发现原缺口处又出了一个小洞，他们当时因无法分身回去叫人，便一齐跳入水中以身堵住洞口，在风雨中过了一夜，直到天明时才有人来修补缺口。由于他们奋不顾身的努力，附近一万五千多亩庄稼得以免遭水灾。
    在已遭水淹的地区，青年团员和当地农民一起，挖沟、排水、救苗或补种。颍上县樊台乡老龙洼一带遭水淹后，该乡一百七十九个团员配合当地农民，在乡干部领导下，两天内挖沟十二条，把水全部疏出，救了一千多亩庄稼。在补种时，青年团支部书记李开庆又带领团员带头抢种，团员并帮助军属及缺乏劳动力的群众种地。
    在受灾区，青年团员动员青年和群众，克服悲观情绪，积极生产自救。同时青年团员在参加救济、安插灾民等工作上，也都成为当地共产党和人民政府的有力助手。
