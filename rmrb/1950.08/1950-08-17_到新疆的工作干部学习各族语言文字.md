Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 14th: Cadres transferred from the interior to work in Xinjiang are now responding to the call of the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee and are working hard to learn the languages and scripts of various ethnic groups. The Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has also decided to select a number of cadres from the army to specialize in learning the Uighur language and script, striving to achieve proficiency within two or three years. At the same time, it is calling on all army personnel to universally learn the daily spoken and written Uighur language to enhance military-civilian relations. Some units of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government are currently launching a movement for cadres of various ethnic groups to learn each other's languages. In the Provincial Trade Company and the Department of Commerce alone, 120 cadres (including Uighur, Kazakh, Tatar and other ethnic cadres) have voluntarily organized four Uighur language groups and two Chinese language groups.

　　到新疆的工作干部学习各族语言文字
    【新华社西安十四日电】从内地调赴新疆工作的干部，现正响应中共中央新疆分局的号召，努力学习各民族的语言和文字。人民解放军新疆军区也决定以军为单位抽调若干干部，专门学习维吾尔族的语言和文字，争取在二、三年内达到精通。同时并号召全军人员普遍学习维族日用语言和文字，以增进军民联系。新疆省人民政府有些单位现正展开各民族干部之间互相学习彼此的语言的运动。仅省贸易公司和商业厅，即有一百二十名干部（包括维吾尔、哈萨克、塔塔尔等族干部）自动组织了四个维文组，两个汉文组。
