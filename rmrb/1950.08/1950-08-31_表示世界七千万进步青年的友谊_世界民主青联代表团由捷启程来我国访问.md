Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 30th: At the invitation of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) to visit New China is scheduled to depart from Czechoslovakia on the 30th, via Moscow, to China. The delegation is led by WFDY General Secretary Jacques Denis Duclos, and consists of 39 members, representing major countries from five continents, namely: the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Vietnam, the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Greece, the Netherlands, Spain, Brazil, Cuba, Algeria, South Africa, India, Burma, Indonesia, Australia, and Syria, Iran. Many of the representatives are leaders of youth movements beloved by the vast number of young people in their respective countries.

The reporter visited the delegation leader, Jacques Denis Duclos, on the eve of the delegation's departure and met several representatives. They all expressed their gratitude for the invitation from the Chinese youth and were excited to be able to meet with the Chinese youth who had achieved victory in their struggle. They said that many representatives from colonial and oppressed countries would be able to learn valuable experience from the Chinese youth in resisting imperialist aggression and striving for national independence during this visit. Progressive young workers and intellectuals from capitalist countries expressed their intention to assure the youth of China and Asia that they would stand together with progressive people in capitalist countries to fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons, against aggressive war, and for the defense of world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 30th: The World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation to China held a press conference in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, on the afternoon of the 29th. Jacques Denis Duclos, head of the delegation and Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, declared at the meeting that at a time when American imperialists are plotting to expand their war of aggression, the delegation's visit to China is a strong expression of the fraternal friendship between the 70 million progressive youths organized within the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the Chinese youth. This trip by the delegation will greatly strengthen the struggle of youth worldwide for peace, democracy, and national independence. Duclos introduced the thirty-nine representatives from twenty-eight countries, who were gathered in Prague, to the reporters, saying: Seeing these outstanding representatives, people can see the close unity of international youth.

Duclos especially introduced Kelaba, the secretary of the Algerian Democratic Youth League. This Arab youth leader was arrested and imprisoned for opposing the French invasion of Vietnam and was released not long ago under the international youth's protests of solidarity. At the request of reporters, Kelaba recounted his arrest and release, to which the whole audience responded with warm applause.

The female youth representative from the United States reported on the situation of American youth students opposing aggressive war. She said that the war-mongers of Wall Street are loudly agitating and encouraging young people to serve as cannon fodder, but for many days, out of more than five million young people in the Chicago area, only twenty have gone to the registration office to inquire about enlisting.

Wu Xueqian, the representative of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, expressed a warm welcome to the representatives visiting China at the meeting.

    记者于代表团启行前夕往访代表团团长布加拉，见到了代表团的若干代表。他们都表示感谢中国青年的邀请，并以能和在斗争中获得胜利的中国青年会晤而感兴奋。他们说：许多殖民地和被压迫国家的代表，将能在此次访问中向中国青年学习反对帝国主义侵略和争取民族独立的宝贵斗争经验。资本主义国家的进步青年工人领袖和知识分子，表示要向中国和亚洲的青年保证，他们要和资本主义国家的进步人士站在一起，为禁止原子武器、反对侵略战争和保卫世界和平而斗争。
    【新华社布拉格三十日电】世界民主青年联盟访华代表团，于二十九日下午在捷京布拉格举行记者招待会。代表团团长、世界民主青联总书记布加拉在会上宣称：正当美帝国主义者阴谋扩大其侵略战争之时，代表团的访问中国，是强烈表示了组织在世界民主青年联盟之内的七千万进步青年与中国青年的兄弟情谊。代表团此行将大大加强全世界青年为和平民主与民族独立而进行的斗争。布加拉把现在集中在布拉格的代表二十八个国家的三十九位代表，介绍给记者相识，并且说：看到这些优秀的代表，人们便可以看到国际青年的紧密团结。

    美国的女青年代表报告了美国青年学生反对进行侵略战争的情形。她说：华尔街的战争贩子们大声鼓噪着鼓动青年们去充当炮灰，但好多天以来，芝加哥区域的五百余万青年中，仅有二十个人到登记处去探问了入伍情形。
