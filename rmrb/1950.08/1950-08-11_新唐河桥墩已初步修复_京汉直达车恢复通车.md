Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Beijing-Hankou Railway through train service officially resumed on August 10th. The through train service on this line was interrupted because the No. 3 pier of the New Tang River Bridge between Zhengding and Qingfengdian was washed away and subsided by floods on the night of August 4th. After the Tianjin Railway Bureau's railway workers worked day and night to actively repair it, it has been initially restored. The test run on the morning of August 10th went well. Today's No. 107 Beijing-Hankou through ordinary passenger train and No. 7 through express train have both departed from Beijing.
