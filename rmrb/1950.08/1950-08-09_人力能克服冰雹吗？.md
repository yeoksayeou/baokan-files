Can Human Power Overcome Hail?
    Zhu Kezhen

    Editor's Note: On June 12th and 13th, this newspaper successively published news of hail disasters suffered by parts of Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces on May 25th. In addition to reporting the facts of the local people overcoming the hail disaster under the leadership of the People's Government, it also introduced the method of using earthen cannons to bombard hail clouds in the Second District of Wuxiang, Shanxi. Some places in North and Northwest China are promoting this method. However, many readers have written to express doubts or disagreement about the effectiveness of this method. The newspaper's editorial department has repeatedly studied this with all parties. Generally speaking, many old liberated area rural work cadres still believe that earthen cannons are effective in preventing hail, but most scientists believe it is ineffective. We believe that the scientists' opinion is correct, and the method of using earthen cannons to prevent hail is incorrect. In the past, we published some reports on earthen cannons preventing hail due to blindness. Now, we are publishing Vice President Zhu Kezhen of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' article "Can Human Power Overcome Hail?" to clarify this debate. This article was originally written for the fourth issue of the "Science Communications" published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and with Vice President Zhu's consent, it is being published in this newspaper in advance. At the same time, in order to systematically explain whether it is possible to regulate the climate by artificial methods, Chapter 7 of the Soviet Union's Ilyin's book "Man's Conquest of Nature," namely, "Bombarding the Sky," "Rain and Politics," "Work Begins," "Attacking Clouds with Smoke Screens," and "The Sky as a Laboratory," are reprinted for readers' reference.

    According to the report of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the province suffered 110 hailstorms from March 29th to June 17th this year, covering 64 counties, two industrial and mining areas, and the suburbs of Taiyuan City. The affected autumn wheat fields are estimated at more than 3 million mu. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in decades. The People's Daily in Beijing also published a message on June 12th, stating that on May 25th this year, the hail disaster in Shanxi Province was severe, spreading over an area of 20 counties. The large hailstones were the size of bowls, and the smaller ones were the size of eggs and walnuts. The affected wheat fields reached more than 1.3 million mu, of which more than 500,000 mu of wheat fields had no hope of harvest. In this hail disaster, 10 people were killed, more than 200 were injured, and many livestock were killed or injured and houses were destroyed. With such a serious disaster, in addition to the Shanxi Provincial Government comforting the people, organizing replanting and supplementary planting, and reducing or exempting agricultural taxes, all those who are concerned about preventing natural disasters, especially those who study geophysics and meteorology, should pay attention to this issue and do their best to exert human power to fight against nature and prevent the recurrence of this disaster.

    According to the Taiyuan Shanxi Daily and the Beijing People's Daily, Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, organized experienced veteran farmers to set up hail prevention stations and weather observation groups, giving full play to the power of earthen cannons and earthen guns to resist hail, which was very effective. Such a vigorous mobilization of the people to fight against nature in an organized way is a very commendable and praiseworthy thing, and it also shows that the cadres of the People's Government can care about the people's suffering, unlike the past reactionary governments who only engaged in exploitation and were indifferent to the people's suffering. However, if we want to overcome natural disasters, we must carefully consider the formation of natural disasters and the laws of development of natural phenomena, as well as the contradictions and capabilities existing in the development process. If we do not fully understand natural phenomena, and blindly act recklessly, it will only waste manpower and money and will not help.

  I. The Structure of Thunderstorms
    Hail is a companion of thunderstorms. Not every thunderstorm has hail falling to the ground, but hail mostly occurs in thunderstorms. Therefore, to know how hail is formed, we must know the structure of thunderstorms. To create a thunderstorm, two conditions must be met: First, a large amount of humid air, the internal organization of which is not very stable. In other words, a large amount of humid air is hot at the bottom and cold at the top, with a large temperature difference. Second, to create an environment that causes the air at the surface to rise rapidly. With these two conditions, there will be thunderstorms. Ordinary thunderstorms often occur in the afternoon of summer days. The sun bakes the ground so hot that a layer of air near the ground rises slowly. When this mass of air reaches a certain height, the humidity in it reaches saturation, and it condenses into cumulonimbus clouds in the shape of pagodas or cauliflower. The ancients called "summer clouds many strange peaks," which refers to cumulonimbus clouds. After the cumulonimbus clouds are formed, if the air continues to rise, and the supply is continuous, the cumulonimbus clouds develop horizontally and upwards to form anvil-shaped or silky clouds. The top of the cloud can rise to eight thousand to ten thousand meters, and its temperature is far below the freezing point, and the water vapor condenses into ice needles. This can be seen from the appearance of the cloud like horse-tail-shaped cirrus clouds. At this time, the air rises violently, and the phenomenon of strong winds and rain, thunder and lightning can form. This type of thunderstorm is called thermal thunderstorm, or convective thunderstorm. In the front of the thunderstorm, there is a rising hot air current, while in the place where the heavy rain begins and behind it, there is a descending cold air current.

    In most parts of China, thunderstorms travel from northwest to southeast. Hot air flows in from the front of the thunderstorm. When it is about to rain heavily, a strong wind blows from the rear (northwest), and the weather suddenly becomes cool. At first, the raindrops are scattered, because the air is still dry, and some of the raindrops have been evaporated into water vapor in the air. Soon there will be a torrential downpour, and hail will also fall at this time.

    Thermal thunderstorms are very common in the afternoon of summer. They are usually limited to a small area and do not affect a large area. There is also a type of thunderstorm that develops over a wider area and is not limited to the afternoon to evening. This is called frontal thunderstorm. The so-called front refers to the contact surface where two air currents of different temperatures, such as the cold air current from the northwest and the warm air current from the southeast ocean, meet. If the northwest cold air current moves rapidly, it will lift the original warm air current with high humidity and instability, then the two conditions for brewing a thunderstorm mentioned above are met, and the vicinity of the contact surface becomes a cold front thunderstorm. The structure of a cold front thunderstorm is similar to that of a thermal thunderstorm. It also has thick cumulonimbus clouds and rapidly rising air currents, followed by strong winds and rain, and sometimes hail. The difference is that the rainfall area is larger, often forming a belt, that is, the contact zone between cold and hot air. Therefore, cold front thunderstorms are also called squall lines. The saying "hail hits a line" in the Shanxi countryside is probably caused by squall lines. Not every thunderstorm will have hail, and eight or nine out of ten thunderstorms have no hail. However, hail storms are likely to have lightning. Giant hail is a rare phenomenon. According to statistics in continental regions of the middle latitudes, hail the size of walnuts occurs only once in every eight hundred thunderstorms. Hail the size of apples occurs only once in every five thousand thunderstorms.

  II. The Formation of Hail
    If we open a large hailstone, we can see that it is divided into several layers. At the center is a tiny ice particle, surrounded by a layer of opaque snow granules and snowflakes, and then surrounded by a layer of transparent ice. This alternating layering creates a large hailstone. From the internal structure of the hailstone, we can deduce how it is formed. In the front of the thunderstorm, as mentioned above, there is a very strong convection, which is turbulent and fluctuates up and down. A raindrop in the cloud, if carried by the rising convection to a high and cold place, will freeze into an ice particle and then be covered with a layer of snowflakes. Suddenly it descends, melting part of the snowflakes and absorbing some raindrops. Then it rises again, and the rainwater it absorbs condenses into an ice layer. If it rotates up and down, the hailstone will grow thicker and larger layer by layer. Finally, when the hailstone grows so large that the upward convection force can no longer hold it, it descends to the ground.

    From the size of the hailstone, we can also estimate the speed of the upward convection in the air. A hailstone with a diameter of five centimeters (about two inches) requires an upward airflow of 30 meters per second to hold it up and keep it floating in the air. Such a speed of upward airflow is rarely seen even in the front of a thunderstorm. However, it is a well-known fact among experienced pilots that an airplane flying into the front of a thunderstorm can be floated by the upward airflow and is difficult to descend. This upward airflow can carry raindrops and snowflakes to a height of eight thousand meters or ten thousand meters above the ground. Therefore, the thickness of cumulonimbus clouds can often reach six thousand meters to eight thousand meters. In the temperate continental regions, the temperature of the air on the ground in the afternoon of summer is close to 30 degrees Celsius. If it rises to a height of four or five thousand meters above the ground, the air temperature can drop to the freezing point. In theory, all raindrops in the clouds above five kilometers should freeze into ice and snow. However, according to repeated aircraft surveys, we know that in still air, if the water droplets in the clouds are not disturbed by the outside world, they can remain in a liquid state even if the temperature reaches below the freezing point, becoming so-called supercooled rain. Only when the temperature drops to 15 degrees Celsius below zero will snowflakes and ice needles form, and only at 40 degrees Celsius below zero will all raindrops freeze into ice needles. However, in the front of a thunderstorm, the rising airflow is very active, and there is a lot of disturbance. Therefore, at a height of five thousand meters, raindrops can freeze into ice, and then rotate up and down with the rising and falling airflow, and the hail will grow larger. Almost all large-scale thunderstorms have hail in the air, but eight or nine out of ten of these hailstones are dissolved into rainwater on the way down, with a distance of four or five thousand meters, where the temperature is above the freezing point. Hail is less common in the tropics for this reason as well. Hail is a sign of a continental climate, and it is relatively rare along the coast and more common in mountains and inland plains. Planting more forests can reduce the possibility of thermal thunderstorms, but it cannot avoid frontal thunderstorms.

  III. Can Earthen Guns and Cannons Overcome Hail?

    Now that we know the process of hail formation, we can discuss whether the hail prevention struggle in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, is effective. According to a report by special correspondent Ma Chaojun of the Shanxi Daily on July 9, "The hail prevention struggle has made significant achievements in Wuxiang County this year, defeating the invasion of ten hailstorms and protecting 150,000 mu of autumn fields and more than 70,000 mu of wheat fields... Before hail falls, the climate often has signs of being too cold or too hot, with strong northwest winds blowing and the clouds in the sky being large and dense, thick and low, and with continuous thunder. If you see white rain streaks in these clouds from a distance, the hateful hail is about to come." The above description of the situation before the arrival of thunderstorms and hail is very accurate.

    He continued, "When the hail clouds are densely packed overhead, immediately concentrate firepower and fire at the cloud heads until the hail clouds disperse... Wuxiang has five types of cannons for hail prevention: iron cannons, short cannons, ground cannons, elm cannons, and earthen guns. Among them, earthen guns are the most effective, with a barrel length of three feet to three and a half feet, a barrel length of two feet to two and a half feet, and a caliber of two-tenths to three-tenths of an inch. Because the barrel is long, the range is long, and it can shoot eighteen or nineteen yards high." Eighteen or nineteen yards is only sixty or seventy meters, and the thickness of hail clouds is often up to six thousand meters, that is, the bottom of hail clouds is often seven or eight hundred meters above the ground. How can it be effective to shoot hail clouds with earthen guns?

    The report also said: "The Second District of Wuxiang suffered six hailstorms in a row on May 25, all of which were repelled by earthen guns. The cost has been calculated by the county. Yaoshangou fired 42 cannons this year, bought 50 kilograms of gunpowder, and spent a total of 13 stones and 7.5 dou of rice. But it protected 3,176 mu of autumn fields and reduced losses by more than 1,000 or 2,000 stones," etc. But how can the power of 50 kilograms of gunpowder repel hail over 3,176 mu of land? 3,176 mu is equal to about 212 hectares (each hectare is 10,000 square meters). If an average of one inch (two and a half centimeters) of hail falls on this area, there will be 53,000 metric tons of hail. To dissolve 53,000 metric tons of hail into water, it would take 3,300 metric tons of smokeless gunpowder (based on each gram of smokeless gunpowder generating 1,278 calories); to dissipate 53,000 metric tons of hail into gas, it would take 28,200 metric tons of smokeless gunpowder, which is half as powerful as the atomic bomb that bombed Hiroshima, Japan. It is then known that the effect of 50 kilograms of homemade gunpowder can definitely not repel the hail over 3,176 mu.

  IV. The Most Promising Way to Overcome Hail
    Not only earthen guns and cannons cannot overcome hail, but even the most modern anti-aircraft guns are difficult to be effective. Because the volume of the sky is vast, the power of a few anti-aircraft guns cannot have much impact. The Soviet Union's Ilyin's book "Man's Conquest of Nature" has long stated that it is not cost-effective to bombard clouds with shells to make rain. In the past 30 years, although many scientists in Europe and the United States have designed and manufactured rain and snow or eliminated clouds and fog, so far, it can be said that there is no foolproof method. As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." Radar was invented in World War II, which is a very helpful tool for eliminating rain clouds and fog. With radar, we can know the situation of raindrops and snowflakes of a certain size rising and falling in the clouds and fog. In recent years, meteorologists and physicists in the Soviet Union and the United States have been stepping up their work to achieve an effective way to eliminate clouds, fog, and thunderstorms. At the centennial celebration of the British Royal Meteorological Society in early April this year, Dr. V.J. Schafer of the United States reported his experience of spraying silver iodide particles into clouds and fog from aircraft. He eliminated clouds and fog covering 300 square miles near New York. He believes that thunderstorms can eventually be eliminated. As long as precautions are taken in advance, before thunderstorms have formed ferocious cumulonimbus clouds, the internal contradictions of its organization can be used to change the structure of the clouds.

    Although we cannot arbitrarily eliminate thunderstorms and hail at present, meteorologists already have three tools that can be used for this purpose. These three tools are: First, radio high-altitude detectors, which can detect the temperature, humidity, and air pressure of each air layer within 10 kilometers above the ground. The second is a 3-centimeter wavelength radar, which can let us know the condensation and flow of raindrops and snowflakes in the clouds and fog. The third is to use aircraft to stain particles of silver iodide or solid carbon dioxide to eliminate clouds and fog or form raindrops. With these three tools, we can consider the local air conditions and use them to transform the organization of clouds and fog. In short, although there are still some difficulties in overcoming hail and thunderstorms, as long as we fully apply advanced scientific knowledge and technology and work hard, the solution to the problem of hail disasters is only a matter of time.

　　人力能克服冰雹吗？
    竺可桢
    编者按：六月十二、十三两日本报接连刊登山西、平原两省部分地区于五月二十五日遭受雹灾的消息，除报道当地群众在人民政府领导下战胜雹灾的事实外，并介绍了山西武乡第二区用土炮轰击雹云的方法。华北和西北有些地方，正在推广这种方法，但是，许多读者来信，对此种方法的效果表示怀疑，或不同意。本报编辑部对此即与各方面反复研究。大体上说，许多老解放区农村工作干部仍认为土炮打雹有效，一般科学家却都认为无效。我们认为科学家的意见是对的，土炮打雹的方法是不对的。过去我们发表了一些土炮打雹的报道，是出于盲目性。现在发表中国科学院竺可桢副院长的《人力能克服冰雹吗？》一文，以澄清这一争论。该文原为中国科学院出版的“科学通讯”第四期写的，经竺副院长的同意，提前在本报发表。同时，为了比较系统地说明用人为的方法能否调节气候的问题，特将苏联伊林著《人类征服自然》一书之第七章“轰击天空”“雨和政治”“工作开始”“用烟幕来攻击云”“天空作为实验室”五节加以转载。以供读者参考。
    据山西省民政厅的报告，该省本年于三月二十九日到六月十七日，先后降雹一百一十次，普及六十四县、两个工矿区和太原市郊。受灾秋麦田约三百多万亩，灾情之重，为数十年来所未有。六月十二日北京人民日报亦载一项消息，说本年五月二十五日，山西省雹灾为害严重，面积展开达二十个县，冰雹大者如碗，次者如鸡蛋，核桃，受害麦田，达一百三十多万亩，其中有五十多万亩麦田，收成无望。在这次雹灾中，并打死十人，伤二百余人，死伤牲口、毁坏房屋甚多。灾情如此重大，除掉山西省政府安抚人民，组织改种补种，减免征收农业税以外，凡是留心防止天灾的人们，尤其是研究地球物理和气象学的人们，应该注意这个问题，来尽力发挥人为的力量，和自然界斗争，以防卫这种灾祸的重演。
    根据太原山西日报和北京人民日报的消息，山西武乡县组织有经验的老农，设立防雹站和观天组，发挥土炮土枪威力，以抵抗冰雹，甚为有效。这样大力发动民众有组织地来和自然斗争，是很值得奖助赞许的一桩事，也可表示人民政府的干部都能关心民瘼，不像过去反动政府专事搜括而漠不关心人民疾苦。但是我们要能克服天灾，必须精细考虑天灾之所以形成，以及自然现象发展的规律，发展过程中存在的矛盾和能力。假若对于自然现象尚未充分了解清楚，一味盲目傻干，则徒然劳民伤财，于事无补的。
  一、雷雨的结构
    冰雹是雷雨的同路人，不是每次雷雨统有冰雹落到地，但落雹大多是在雷雨中。所以要知道冰雹之所以造成，不能不知道雷雨的结构。要造成雷雨必得有两个条件：第一是大量的潮湿空气，它内部的组织已经不是十分稳定。换言之即是大量的潮湿空气，上冷下热，温度相差很大。第二是造成一种环境，使地面的空气急速上升。具备了这两种条件，才会下雷雨。普通雷雨多在夏日午后，太阳把地面晒得酷热，靠近地面一层空气就冉冉上升。到了相当高度，这团空气中湿度达到饱和点，就结成宝塔状或菜花状的积云。古人所谓“夏云多奇峰”，即是指积云而言。积云结成以后，若是空气继续向上升腾，再接再厉源源不绝，积云就向横里和上面发展形成砧状或绢状。云的顶部可升到八千到一万公尺，它的温度远在冰点以下，水气凝结成为冰针。从云的外貌犹如马尾状的卷云这一点就可看出来。这时空气升腾，来势凶猛，便可形成狂风骤雨，雷鸣电闪的现象。这种雷雨称为热雷雨，或称对流性雷雨。在雷雨的前部有上升的热气流，而在大雨开始的地方和其后部则有下降的冷气流。
    在我国大部雷雨自西北行向东南。热空气自雷雨前方流入。到要下大雨的时候，狂风自后方（西北方）吹来，天气骤变凉爽。起初雨点尚属零落，因为空气尚干燥，一部分雨点在半空中已被蒸发为水气，不久就有倾盆大雨，雹子亦在此时降落。
    热雷雨在夏季午后极为常见，普通限于一个狭小区域，影响面积不大。尚有一种雷雨其发展面积较为广泛，时间也不限定在午后到晚间，这名叫锋面雷雨。所谓锋面者，乃两种温度不同气流，如我国从西北来的寒冷气流和东南海洋来的温暖气流相遇到的接触面。如西北寒流行动迅速，便把原来湿度高而不甚稳定的暖气流高举上升，则上面所讲两种酿成雷雨的条件均已具备，接触面的附近便成冷锋面雷雨。冷锋面雷雨的结构和热雷雨有相似处，其中也有很厚的积雨云和急速上升气流，继之而来的就是狂风骤雨，有时亦可有冰雹。所不同者降雨区域较广大，常形成一带，即冷热两种空气之接触带。所以冷锋面雷雨又称为线飑。山西乡间俗语有“雹打一条线”之说，大概是线飑所造成。不是每个雷雨统会降冰雹，雷雨中十之八九无冰雹降落。但是降雹的风暴中，大概是有雷电的。巨大冰雹，为稀有现象。据中纬度大陆地区的统计，下冰雹如胡桃大者每八百次雷雨中只有一次。下冰雹如苹果大者每五千次雷雨中只一次而已。
  二、冰雹的形成
    我们若把大粒的雹子打开来看，可以知道他是分为好几层的。在中心是一颗微小的冰粒，外面包了一层不透明的雪珠和雪片，再外又包了一层透明的冰，如此层层更迭，造成一颗大雹。从雹子内部的组织，我们就可以推想到他是如何造成的。在雷雨的前部，上面已说过，有很强盛的对流，这对流是扰攘不定，忽上忽下的。云中一粒雨点，若被上升对流带到高处冷的地方，便结成冰粒，再沾上一层雪花。忽而下降，便把雪花溶掉一部，再引收多少雨点。继又上升，便把所沾雨水凝为冰层。如果回旋上下，便使雹子一层一层加厚，愈长愈大。到了最后雹子长得这样庞大，上升对流力量已经不能抵住时，他便下降到地面。
    从雹子的大小，我们也可估计空中上升对流的速度。一颗五公分（约二英寸）直径的雹子，就需要每秒钟三十公尺的上升气流，方能抵住他，使它浮在空中。像这样速度的上升气流，就在雷雨的前部，也很少见的。不过一只飞机，飞到雷雨的前部，被上升气流所飘浮着，不易下降，倒是有经验的驾驶员熟知的一桩事。这种上升气流可以把雨点、雪花带到离地八千公尺或一万公尺的高度。所以积雨云的厚度常可达六千公尺到八千公尺。在温带里大陆上，夏季午后地面空气的温度靠近摄氏表三十度，上升到离地四、五千公尺，空气温度便已可降到冰点。照理在五公里以上云中的雨点统应该结成冰雪。但据叠次飞机的探测，我们才知道在静止的空气里，云中水点若非有外界的扰动，虽温度到了冰点以下仍可保持液体状态，成所谓过冷却的雨。直到温度低到摄氏零下十五度，普通才有雪花冰针结出，到零下四十度才能全部雨点结为冰针。但是雷雨的前部，上升气流既极活跃，便有很大的扰动。所以到五千公尺高度，雨点便可冻结成冰，以后随了升降气流回旋上下，冰雹便长大起来。差不多所有大规模的雷雨在空中统有冰雹，不过十之八九这类冰雹在降落的途中，有四五千公尺的路程，温度统在冰点以上，早已把雹子溶消为雨水了。在热带里冰雹反而少见，亦是这个原因。冰雹是大陆气候的征象，沿海比较少见，山岳和内陆平原上比较普通。多植森林，可以减少热雷雨的可能性，但是不能避免锋面雷雨。
  三、土枪土炮可以克服冰雹吗？
    我们知道了冰雹造成的程序，便可来讨论山西武乡县防雹的斗争是否有效的一个问题。据山西日报七月九日特约通讯员马超骏的报道，“防雹斗争今年在武乡县已做出了显著的成绩，战胜了十次雹雨的侵袭，保护了秋田十五万亩，麦田七万余亩。……下雹前气候往往有过冷过热的象征，西北风狂吹，天空云层块大而密，云厚而低，雷声连响。并远远望见这些云层有白的雨条的话，可恶的冰雹就要到来。”以上所讲雷雨冰雹到来前之情形极为确切。
    他继续说：“当雹云密集头顶天空时，立即集中火力，向云头发射，直至雹云四散为止。……武乡在防雹中有五种炮：铁炮、寸子炮、地墩炮、榆木炮、和土枪。其中土枪效力最大，枪身长三尺至三尺半，枪筒二尺至二尺半，口径二分至三分。因枪筒长，发射远，可打十八九丈高。”十八九丈高不过六七十公尺，而雹云的厚度常达六千公尺，即雹云的底部离地亦常在七八百公尺。以土枪打雹云，如何能生效力呢？
    该报告又说：“武乡二区五月二十五日连下六次雹雨，都被土枪打退。所花费用县里曾做过计算。窑上沟今年打了四十二门炮，买火药五十斤，共用米十三石七斗五升。但却防护了三千一百七十六亩秋田，减少损失非只一二千石”云云。但是五十斤火药的力量，如何能打退三千一百七十六亩田地上的冰雹呢？三千一百七十六亩约等于二百十二垧（每垧为一万平方公尺），如若在这面积上平均落一寸厚（两公分半）的雹子，便有五万三千公吨冰雹。要把五万三千公吨冰雹溶解为水，就需要三千三百公吨的无烟火药（以每克无烟火药能发热一千二百七十八卡路里计）；若要把五万三千公吨冰雹发散为气，便要二万八千二百公吨的无烟火药，它的威力比轰炸日本广岛的原子弹还要大一半。那就可知道五十斤土造火药的能效，决计无法能打退三千一百七十六亩上面的冰雹。
  四、克服冰雹最有希望的办法
    不但土枪土炮无法克服冰雹，就是最新式的高射炮也难发生效力。因为天空体积浩大，少数高射炮的威力不能发生多少影响。苏联伊林著“人类征服自然”这部书里早经讲过以炮弹轰击云块变成雨是不合算的。过去三十年中在欧美虽有不少科学家设计制造雨雪或消灭云雾，但到现在为止，可说尚无十全有效的办法。古语说：“工欲善其事，必先利其器。”第二次世界大战中发明了雷达，这是对于消灭雷雨云雾极有帮助的一件利器。有了雷达我们就可以知道云雾中到达一定大小雨点和冰雪浮沉上下的情形。最近几年苏联和美国的气象学家和物理学家正在加紧工作，要想达到一个有效地消灭云雾和雷雨的办法。在本年四月初英国皇家气象学会成立一百周年的纪念会上，美国雪福博士（Dr.V.J.Schafer）报告了他用飞机喷散碘化银微粒于云雾中的经验。他把纽约附近遮蔽天空三百英方里的云雾消灭了。他认为终久雷雨是可取消的。只要防范于事先，在雷雨还没有形成凶恶积雨云的时候，利用它组织内在的矛盾，把云的结构变了质。
    我们眼前虽还不能随意消灭雷雨和冰雹，但气象学家已经有了三种可用于这一目的的利器，这三种利器就是：第一、无线电高空探测器，可以探测离地面十公里以内各空气层的温度，湿度和气压。第二是三公分波长的雷达，能使我们知道云雾中雨点和雪片凝结流动的情形。第三是用飞机渍散微粒的碘化银或固体二氧化碳，使云雾消灭或结成雨点。有了这三种利器，便可酌量当地空气情形，用来改造云雾的组织。总之，克服冰雹雷雨的前途，虽尚有某些困难，只要充分地应用先进科学知识与技术努力做去，关于冰雹灾害问题的解决，只是时间问题而已。
