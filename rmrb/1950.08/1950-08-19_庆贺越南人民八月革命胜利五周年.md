　　Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the August Revolution Victory of the Vietnamese People
　　Five years ago today, taking advantage of the opportunity when the great Soviet armed forces crushed Japanese imperialism, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of their leader General Ho Chi Minh, launched a general revolutionary uprising. The National Liberation Committee expelled the Hanoi puppet government supported by the Japanese invaders, and formally proclaimed the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 2 of the same year. The victory of the August Revolution of the Vietnamese people was not only the starting point for the Vietnamese national liberation struggle to move towards a complete victory, but also a great encouragement to the liberation struggles of other oppressed nations in Asia. Precisely because of this, the imperialist colonialists tried to restore their rule over Vietnam and launched a war of aggression for more than three years for this purpose. Precisely because of this, American imperialism, which is increasingly trapped in the quagmire of Korea, is also targeting the young Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Truman shamelessly transported weapons and food to the French-occupied areas of Vietnam and even scoured Japan and West Germany for cannon fodder to rescue the repeatedly defeated French colonial army. But even the military and economic mission led by US State Department special envoy Melby, who was sent to help, had to express disappointment and pessimism. Those Americans were afraid to go to the war zone and only inspected the battle situation in the air by plane, and the real truth they gained was the demoralization of the French colonial army and the extreme instability of the Bao Dai puppet regime.
　　On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the August Revolution in Vietnam, we have already seen that the Vietnamese people's liberation war has achieved a basic victory. Since December 1946, when French imperialism tore up the "Franco-Vietnamese Agreement" and perfidiously launched an armed plundering offensive against the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army has become stronger and stronger in battle. Now, more than 90 percent of the land and 20 million people in Vietnam have been completely liberated. The armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have grown more than tenfold compared to the initial 10,000 regular troops and 30,000 guerrillas. Since the spring of this year, the people of Vietnam have actively participated in the task of general mobilization, and the "support the army" and "donate money" campaigns have been widely carried out. The student joining the army movement is also very enthusiastic. After the successful conclusion of the spring and summer offensives, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army has blockaded the French-occupied garrisons in the towns of Lai Chau, Lao Cai, Cao Bang, and Lang Son provinces in North Vietnam, forcing the French troops in these isolated strongholds to rely on air transport for supplies. In Central Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army broke through the French army's defenses, rendering the local French army unable to move.
　　Since launching the plundering offensive, the French colonial army has suffered repeated defeats. It spends an average of 115 billion francs per year on the battlefield, and has lost 150,000 troops in more than three years. Now, in order to barely maintain a few large cities along the coast and railways, it has trapped another 150,000 troops in the quagmire. The French working people, together with the democratic forces of the world, are vehemently opposing the colonial war waged by the Pleven government. French dockworkers and railway workers persistently refuse to load military supplies to Vietnam. The movement of the French people demanding an end to the colonial war in Vietnam, combined with the movement demanding the prohibition of atomic bombs, is also growing.
　　The current international situation is clearly favorable to the Vietnamese people's struggle for liberation. The Soviet Union, China and other people's democratic countries and the democratic forces of the world, together with the French working people, support this struggle of the Vietnamese people. Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh said in a statement on July 16 this year:
　　"The American imperialists have been defeated in China. They will also be defeated in Vietnam. We have encountered many difficulties, but we are confident that we will win."
　　We, the Chinese people, like the Vietnamese people, have full confidence in the final victory of the Vietnamese people. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the August Revolution of the Vietnamese people, we would like to wish the final victory of the Vietnamese people to come soon.

### 庆贺越南人民八月革命胜利五周年

　　庆贺越南人民八月革命胜利五周年
    在五年前的今日，越南人民乘着伟大的苏联武装力量粉碎了日本帝国主义的时机，在越南人民领袖胡志明将军领导之下，举行了革命总起义。民族解放委员会驱逐了日寇所支持的河内傀儡政府，并于同年九月二日正式宣告了越南民主共和国的成立。越南人民的八月革命的胜利不仅是越南民族解放斗争走向全面胜利的起点，而且对于亚洲其他被压迫民族的解放斗争也是极大的鼓舞。正因为如此，帝国主义殖民者便力图恢复对于越南的统治，并为此而发动了三年多以来的侵略战争。也正因为如此，在朝鲜泥沼里愈陷愈深的美国帝国主义也把一个矛头针对着年青的越南民主共和国。杜鲁门公开无耻地把武器和粮食输送到越南的法占区去，还在日本和西德搜罗一些炮灰去援救屡战屡败的法国殖民军。但是甚至被派去助战的美国务院特使梅尔拜所率领的军事和经济使团到了越南，也不得不表示失望和悲观。那些美国人吓得不敢到战区去，只坐了飞机在空中视察一番战斗的情况，而所深得的真象就是法殖民军的士气沮丧和保大傀儡政权的极度不稳。
    在越南八月革命五周年纪念的今天，我们已经看到越南人民解放战争取得了基本的胜利。自从一九四六年十二月法国帝国主义撕毁了“法越协定”，背信弃义地对越南人民发动武装掠夺的进攻以来，越南人民解放军是愈战愈强了。现在越南全境百分之九十以上的土地，二千万的人口已获得了完全的解放。越南民主共和国的武装力量比最初正规军一万余人和游击队三万余人发展了十余倍。今年春季以来，越南全国人民积极参加执行总动员的任务，“拥军”和“献金”运动广泛开展。学生参军运动也十分热烈。春季和夏季的攻势胜利结束以后，越南人民解放军已经在北越方面把莱州、老开、高平、谅山诸省各城镇的法占领军封锁起来，使这些孤立据点的法军给养不得不靠空运来供应。在中越方面，越南人民解放军穿过了法军的防线，使当地法军动弹不得。
    法国殖民军自从发动掠夺进攻以来，屡战屡败，它在战场上每年平均花费一千一百五十亿法郎，三年多损失了十五万人的兵力，现在为了要勉强保持着沿海和沿铁路的几个大城市，它又使另外十五万军队陷在泥沼里了。法国劳动人民和全世界民主力量在一起，正在剧烈反对着普利文政府所进行的殖民战争。法国码头工人和铁路工人坚持不懈地拒绝装运军用品到越南去。法国人民要求停止越南殖民战争的运动，和要求禁用原子弹的运动结合在一起也愈来愈高涨了。
    当前的国际形势显然是有利于越南人民争取解放的斗争的。苏联、中国及其他各人民民主国家和全世界的民主力量，连同法国劳动人民在内，都支持着越南人民的这一斗争。越南人民领袖胡志明于本年七月十六日发表谈话说：
    “美帝国主义者已在中国遭到失败。他们在越南也将被击败。我们曾遇到很多的困难，但是我们确信一定会获得胜利。”
    我们中国人民和越南人民一样，对于越南人民的最后胜利是有充分的信心的，在越南人民八月革命五周年纪念的今天，我们谨祝越南人民的最后胜利早日到来。
