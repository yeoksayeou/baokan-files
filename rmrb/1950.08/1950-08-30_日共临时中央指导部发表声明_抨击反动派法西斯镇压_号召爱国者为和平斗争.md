　　The CCP Provisional Central Guidance Department Issues Statement
    Condemning the Reactionary Faction's Fascist Suppression
    Calling on Patriots to Fight for Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch from Tokyo] Delayed Tokyo news: The Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on July 31, denouncing the reactionary ruling class for "dismissing" Communist Party members and other progressive workers engaged in journalism, starting on July 28, and calling on the Japanese people to fight for upholding the truth and striving for freedom of speech and publication. The statement pointed out: If we succumb to the reactionary faction's suppression, all reporting agencies will revert to the "Headquarters Announcements" style of reporting as in the Tojo era, blinding the eyes and ears of the people. The Japanese people will once again fall into a dark age and be plunged into the plight of colonial slaves.
    The statement further pointed out: The "dismissal" measures are gradually expanding from the press to the electrical industry and heavy industry trade unions. This is to turn the trade unions back into "Industrial Service Associations" (Note: "Industrial Service Association" was a tool used by the Japanese military and fascists during the war to organize unions controlled by the government and fascists to implement fascist rule over workers). The reactionaries are attempting to transform workers' organizations into a wartime mobilization system in order to thoroughly implement wage reductions and exploit slave-like "intensified labor," engaging in the so-called mobilization of "human resources."
    The statement continued: Such frantic fascist suppression does not indicate the enemy's strength, nor does it indicate that it has confidence. On the contrary, the rise of international and Japanese peace forces makes the enemy frantic and agitated, and it has lost its confidence.
    The statement finally called on Japanese patriots to rise up in the struggle against war and for peace and independence, and to unite around the democratic national front.

　　日共临时中央指导部发表声明
    抨击反动派法西斯镇压
    号召爱国者为和平斗争
    【新华社二十九日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党临时中央指导部于七月三十一日发表声明，抨击反动统治阶级于七月二十八日开始“解雇”从事新闻工作的共产党员及其他进步职工，并号召日本人民为坚持真理、争取言论、出版自由而奋斗。声明指出：假如我们就此屈服于反动派的镇压下，所有的报道机关就会重返曾如东条时代那样的“大本营发表”式的报道，蒙蔽人民的耳目。日本人民将再度沦于黑暗时代，陷于殖民地奴隶境遇。
    声明进一步指出：“解雇”措施正在逐步地由新闻界扩展到电气产业及重工业工会等方面。使工会再度“产业报国会化”（按“产业报国会”是战时日本军部及法西斯分子为对工人进行法西斯统治所组织的御用“工会”）。反动派企图将工人组织改变为战时动员体制，以彻底地实行降低工资及榨取奴隶似的“强化劳动”，从事所谓“人的资源”的动员。
    声明继称：如此疯狂的法西斯镇压，决不是说明敌人的强大，也不是表示它有自信。相反的，国际和日本的和平力量的高涨，使敌人狂暴与焦躁，丧失了自信。
    声明最后号召日本爱国者为反对战争、争取和平与独立的斗争而奋起，并团结在民主民族战线的周围。
