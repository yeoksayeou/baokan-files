　　Rectifying the Work Style of Public Security Personnel

The work of the People's Public Security is one of the most important tasks of the People's State. During the rectification movement, rectifying the work style of public security personnel, so that their work can be carried out in a more sound and effective manner, is an important political task.

In the great victory of the People's Liberation War, the People's Public Security Organs, the People's Public Security Forces, and the People's Police achieved tremendous successes. Coordinating with the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Public Security Personnel swiftly shattered the reactionary police system of the Kuomintang bandit gangs in the newly liberated cities and rural areas, established People's Public Security Organs, destroyed the organizations of bandits, secret agents, and various reactionary parties and groups, and actively participated in the work of establishing revolutionary order. In the old liberated areas, the People's Public Security Personnel continued to protect the original social order, providing favorable conditions for various production and construction tasks. In the sharp and complex struggle against secret agents, spies, and various saboteurs, many public security personnel were tempered, learned new skills, and developed an excellent work style of serving the people. Thanks to their hard work, according to incomplete statistics, from the beginning of 1949 to June 1950, more than 28,000 secret agents and saboteurs were captured nationwide, and more than 1,176 hidden radio stations of secret agents were seized and uncovered. According to statistics from the four cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing in the year after liberation, the People's Public Security Organs solved 95 percent of robbery cases and 80 percent of theft cases. In addition, the People's Public Security Organs also took in and reformed thieves, beggars, and prostitutes in many cities, turning them to production. The urban public security organs expanded the scope of work of the police stations and established various work systems such as household registration, traffic, and fire protection. Due to the work and style of the People's Public Security Organs, the people of the whole country have generally recognized that the People's Public Security Organs and their personnel belong to the people themselves and are fundamentally different from the reactionary police organs and their personnel. The people of the whole country support their own public security organs and demand that they, together with the People's Liberation Army, effectively carry out the glorious tasks stipulated in Articles 10 and 7 of the Common Program, namely, "to defend China's independence and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, to defend the revolutionary achievements and all legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people," and "to suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, to severely punish all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause, and other incorrigible counter-revolutionary ringleaders."

It is precisely because of this that some of the bad tendencies among the People's Public Security Personnel must be resolutely corrected in order to consolidate the existing positions and continue to move forward.

How should we correct the bad tendencies among our public security personnel? For this question, we can answer with two famous maxims of Chairman Mao, namely: "Be gentle to ourselves, be ruthless to the enemy." The so-called "ourselves" refers to the people and our comrades; the so-called "enemy" refers to imperialist aggressors, Kuomintang reactionaries, secret agents, spies, saboteurs, and other public enemies of the people. It is correct to act according to this principle, and it is wrong to violate this principle, and it should be corrected.

As mentioned above, our public security personnel have achieved successes in the struggle against the enemy, but there are still many places where they are not ruthless enough to the enemy or, although ruthless, not appropriately ruthless. This tendency is, of course, harmful to our struggle against the enemy and should, of course, be reviewed and overcome in the rectification movement. Chairman Mao said in his report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "It is necessary to resolutely eliminate all bandits, secret agents, despots, and other counter-revolutionary elements who endanger the people. On this issue, it is necessary to implement a policy of combining suppression with leniency, that is, the ringleaders must be dealt with, the coerced are not to be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service are to be rewarded, and none of them should be neglected. The whole Party and the people of the whole country must heighten their vigilance against the conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements." Chairman Mao's instruction, as well as the "Instructions on Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Activities" promulgated by the Government Administration Council and the Supreme People's Court on July 23, stipulated a clear standard for our public security personnel on how to implement "ruthlessness to the enemy." We made a detailed explanation of this issue in the commentary "Severely Punish Counter-Revolutionary Elements" on July 24, so I will not repeat it here.

In relations with the masses of the people, our public security personnel have made a fundamental distinction from the old police, but it must be pointed out that some public security personnel still have the following serious tendencies: First, a small number of public security personnel still violate human rights. Some public security personnel abuse their power, disregard policies, violate laws and discipline, engage in random arrests, trials, and handling of cases, as well as bullying and domineering phenomena. For example, Yang Ying, the chief of staff of the Shijiazhuang Security Brigade, once led a team to surround a railway factory and illegally tied up and beat the political commissar of the factory, and Liu Guoyi, a public security officer in Hejian County, Hebei Province, used violence to force marriage. Second, many public security personnel inappropriately use coercive methods to carry out work that should not be carried out with coercive methods. For example, Gu Fengqi, a public security officer in Hongqiao Town, District 1, Yutian County, Hebei Province, beat residents who were unwilling to get vaccinations in order to get them to get vaccinations. Third, a small number of public security personnel still engage in corruption and embezzlement. For example, Zeng, the director of the Sanchahe Police Station of the Nanjing Municipal Public Security Bureau, gambled for more than 40 days, and 21 of the 214 police officers of the Seventh Branch of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau engaged in illegal transactions in two months. Although this is not directly dealing with the people, it is also a question of attitude towards the trust and interests of the people.

The above-mentioned examples show that many People's Public Security Personnel still lack a fundamental understanding of their attitude towards the people. They do not understand what the glory of the position of People's Public Security Personnel lies in. Is it because it has the privilege of doing whatever it wants? Of course not. The reason why People's Public Security Personnel are valuable is because, like the People's Liberation Army, they belong to the people's armed forces and are able to serve the people's democratic dictatorship wholeheartedly. People's Public Security Personnel should exercise dictatorship over the enemies of the people, and it is wrong not to exercise dictatorship; however, for the people themselves, dictatorship should not be exercised, but democracy should be exercised, and the people's legitimate democratic rights should be protected, and they should loyally serve as the people's orderlies and guards, and it is also wrong not to do so. The fundamental reason why some public security personnel have committed wrongdoings such as infringing on human rights, coercion, corruption, and embezzlement is that they have not stood on a correct position to treat the people.

Why do we find such tendencies in the ranks of our glorious public security personnel? This is because the ideological style of the old police of the reactionary ruling class, who specialized in ruling the people, has invaded our People's Public Security Organs and People's Public Security Personnel; this is because there is a serious situation of impure organization in our People's Public Security Organs and People's Police; and this is also because the leading personnel of the People's Public Security work in some areas and some departments have a bureaucratic tendency, so that they have not timely and thoroughly corrected those serious tendencies. Some leading cadres lack experience, and have not studied well, some leading cadres are complacent and busy calculating fame and status, and neglect to check work and help subordinates, and some leading cadres inappropriately emphasize the particularity of public security work and lack the idea of correctly relying on the masses. All of this has created the bureaucracy of these leading personnel and has fueled the bad tendencies in the People's Public Security work.

There is no doubt that all the bad tendencies we are talking about here must be overcome in the rectification movement, and they are completely capable of being overcome. The following three methods should be adopted in the rectification movement:

First, extensively conduct ideological education of serving the people among the People's Public Security Personnel, thoroughly explain the principled distinction between the People's Public Security Personnel and the police in the reactionary rule, so as to create a conscious mass reform movement. This work is very important, because a large part of the People's Public Security Personnel are retained personnel, and most of them are willing to learn and make progress, and only a very small number refuse to reform, and even conspire to sabotage, and must be washed away. Some of our People's Public Security Organs have not done enough of this work, and it should be universally promoted.

Second, check and summarize the public security work. In the summary work, good people and good deeds should be commended, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out for bad ones. Especially leading cadres at all levels should set an example in conducting self-criticism and accepting criticism. Short-term training teams are one of the very good methods of summarizing work for lower-level public security personnel, and must be adopted.

Third, strengthen the supervision of the vast masses over the work of the People's Public Security. Except for the secrets that should be kept in the struggle against hidden enemies, the People's Public Security Organs should strive for all opportunities to establish extensive contacts with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, rely on the strength of the masses, unite and lead the masses to fight together to defend the revolutionary order. Absolutely no retaliation is allowed for any criticism raised by the masses of the people, and those who retaliate should be punished.

We hope that the People's Public Security Personnel all over the country can adopt the above-mentioned methods and conscientiously carry forward their advantages and correct their deviations in the rectification movement. In this way, our serious struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary activities and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship will surely achieve even greater victories than now.

### 整顿公安人员的工作作风

　　整顿公安人员的工作作风
    人民公安工作是人民国家的最重要工作之一。在整风运动中，整顿公安人员的工作作风，使他们的工作进行得更健全有力，是一个重要的政治任务。
    在人民解放战争的伟大胜利中，人民公安机关、人民公安部队和人民警察的工作有了巨大的成绩。人民公安人员配合人民解放军的胜利进军，在新解放的城市和农村中迅速地粉碎了国民党匪帮的反动警察制度，建立了人民的公安机关，摧毁了土匪特务和各种反动党团的组织，积极参加了建立革命秩序的工作。在老解放区，人民公安人员继续保卫原有的社会秩序，为各项生产建设工作供给了有利的条件。在与特务、间谍及各种破坏分子进行尖锐和复杂的斗争中，许多公安人员受到了锻炼，学会了新的技术，养成了为人民服务的优良作风。依靠他们的艰苦努力，据不完全统计，从一九四九年初到一九五○年六月，全国捕获特务破坏分子二万八千余人，收缴破获特务潜伏电台一千一百七十六部。据北京、天津、上海、南京四城市解放后一年间统计，人民公安机关破获的抢劫案达百分之九十五，破获的偷盗案达百分之八十。此外，人民公安机关还在许多城市收容和改造了小偷、乞丐和妓女，使他们转入了生产。城市公安机关扩大了派出所的工作范围，并且建立了户口、交通、消防等各项工作制度。由于人民公安机关的工作和作风，全国人民已经普遍认识到人民公安机关及其人员是属于人民自己的，是与反动警察机关及其人员根本不同了的。全国人民支持着自己的公安机关，要求它与人民解放军一道，有效地执行着共同纲领第十条和第七条所规定的光荣任务，即“保卫中国的独立和领土主权的完整，保卫中国人民的革命成果和一切合法权益”，“镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子”。
    正因为这样，人民公安人员中的一些不良倾向，就必须坚决地加以纠正，以便巩固已有的阵地而继续前进。
    我们的公安人员中的不良倾向，应当怎样纠正呢？对于这个问题，我们可以用毛主席的两句著名的格言来答复，这就是：“对己要和，对敌要狠。”所谓对己，就是对待人民和自己的同志，所谓对敌，就是对待帝国主义侵略者、国民党反动派、特务间谍破坏分子和其他的人民公敌。按照这个方针做就是正确的，违反这个方针就是错误的，就应当加以纠正。
    如上所说，我们的公安人员在对敌斗争中是有成绩的，但是对敌当狠而不够狠或虽狠而狠得不适当的地方，还有很多。这种倾向当然有害于我们的对敌斗争，在整风运动中当然应当加以检讨和克服。毛主席在中共七届三中全会上的报告说：“必须坚决地肃清一切危害人民的土匪、特务、恶霸及其他反革命分子。在这个问题上，必须实行镇压与宽大相结合的政策，即首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖的政策，不可偏废。全党和全国人民对于反革命分子的阴谋活动，必须提高警惕性。”毛主席的这个指示，以及政务院和最高人民法院在七月二十三日所颁布的“关于镇压反革命活动的指示”，给我们的公安人员怎样实行“对敌要狠”的问题规定了明确的标准。我们在七月二十四日的评论“严惩反革命分子”一文中曾经对这个问题作了详细的说明，所以这里不再多说。
    在对人民群众的关系上，我们的公安人员与旧警察是有了根本的区别，但是必须指出，一部分公安人员还有如下的一些严重的倾向：第一是还有少数公安人员侵犯人权。有些公安人员滥用职权，不讲政策，不守法纪，乱捕、乱审、乱办以及仗势横行的现象。例如石家庄保安大队参谋长杨英曾率队包围铁路工厂，并非法捆打该厂政治委员，河北省河间县公安股员刘国义暴力通婚等。第二是许多公安人员不适当地用强迫命令的方法来进行不应当用强迫命令方法的工作。例如河北省玉田县一区虹桥镇公安员谷凤岐为要居民打防疫针，竟对不愿意打针的居民加以殴打。第三是少数公安人员还有贪污腐化的行为。例如南京市公安局三汊河派出所所长曾聚赌四十余天，天津市公安局七分局员警二百十四人中在两个月内有二十一人曾作违法买卖。这虽然不是直接对待人民的，但也是对待人民的信任和利益的态度问题。
    上述这些事例，表明许多人民公安人员在对待人民的态度上还缺乏根本的认识。他们没有了解，人民公安人员这一个岗位的光荣究竟在什么地方。是因为它有可以为所欲为的特权吗？当然不是的。人民公安人员之所以可贵，是因为它与人民解放军一样，是属于人民的武力，是能够全心全意为人民民主专政服务的。人民公安人员应当对人民的敌人实行专政，不实行专政是不对的；但是对于人民自己，就不应当实行专政，而应当实行民主，而应当保卫人民的合法的民主权利，而应当忠心耿耿地担任人民的勤务员和警卫员，不这样做也是不对的。一部分公安人员之所以发生侵犯人权，强迫命令，贪污腐化等错误行为，根本上就是因为他们没有站在一个正确的立场上来对待人民。
    为什么在我们光荣的公安人员的行列中，会发现这种倾向呢？这是因为反动统治阶级的、专门统治人民的旧警察的思想作风的传统，侵袭了我们的人民公安机关和人民公安人员；这是因为在我们人民公安机关和人民警察中，有着严重的组织不纯的情况；这并且是因为有些地区与有些部门内的人民公安工作的领导人员中，有着官僚主义的倾向，以至没有及时地彻底地纠正那些严重倾向。有些领导干部经验不足，而又未很好地学习，有些领导干部居功自满，忙于计较名誉地位，而疏于检查工作，帮助下级，还有些领导干部不适当地强调公安工作的特殊性，缺乏正确地依靠群众的思想。所有这一切，就造成了这些领导人员的官僚主义，就助长了人民公安工作中的不良倾向。
    毫无疑问，我们在这里所说的一切不良倾向，在整风运动中都是必须克服，而且是完全能够克服的。在整风运动中应当采取这样三种方法：
    第一，在人民公安人员中广泛进行为人民服务的思想教育，把人民公安人员与反动统治中的警察的原则区别，透彻说明，以便造成自觉的群众性的改革运动。这一项工作十分重要，因为人民公安人员中有很大一部分是留用人员，而其中大多数都是愿意学习，愿意进步，只有极少数才是拒绝改造，甚至于阴谋破坏，必须加以洗刷的。这个工作，我们有些人民公安机关还作得不够，应当普遍地推行。
    第二，检查和总结公安工作。在总结工作中，应当对好人好事加以表扬，对不好的展开批评与自我批评。尤其是各级领导干部，在进行自我批评，和接受批评时应当以身作则。对下层公安人员，短期轮训队是很好的总结工作的方法之一，必须注意采用。
    第三，加强广大群众对于人民公安工作的监督。除对隐蔽敌人的斗争应该保守的秘密以外，人民公安机关应当争取一切的机会，与人民群众取得广泛联系，听取群众的意见，依靠群众的力量，团结与领导群众共同为保卫革命秩序而斗争。对于人民群众所提出的任何批评，绝对不容许报复，如有报复者应加以处罚。
    我们希望全国的人民公安人员，都能够采取上述方法，在整风运动中认真地发扬优点，纠正偏向。这样，我们的消灭反革命活动、巩固人民民主专政的严重斗争，一定能够得到比现在更巨大的胜利。
