Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 8th: The second meeting of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Northwest Military and Political Committee was held in Xi'an from July 24th to 31st. The central topic of this meeting was to consolidate the achievements of unified financial and economic work and, on this basis, to adjust industry and commerce. Based on the main problems currently existing in industry and commerce in the Northwest region, the meeting decided to first adjust the relations between production and sales, the public and private sectors, and labor and management.

In terms of the relationship between production and sales, the main problems currently existing in various parts of the Northwest are blind production and disconnection between production and sales. Several important enterprises have formed a phenomenon of production stagnation. For example, in the flour and match industries, 20 factories have stopped or suspended operations due to sluggish sales of products. Other production units, such as coal mines, also have similar situations. Therefore, the meeting determined that these public and private enterprises should implement the principle of "determining production by sales" on the basis of improving management methods. The flour industry in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, and the Northwest match industry have already agreed on the distribution of production and sales quantities through consultation. The coal industry is about to hold a meeting to determine the scope of production and sales. Various other industries are also preparing to adjust production and sales relationships based on the principle of voluntary participation.

In terms of the relationship between the public and private sectors, some cadres in the government and state-owned enterprises still have deviations in their understanding. In entrusting private factories with processing and ordering goods from private factories, state-owned enterprises have purely business and relief viewpoints, blindly supplying processing raw materials, and failing to strictly require the entrusted private factories to earnestly fulfill contracts. In addition, there is also a phenomenon of blind lending that deviates from production in credit work, and the situation of excessively heavy or light taxation has not yet been eliminated. Therefore, the meeting determined that state-owned enterprises should focus on several major industries such as cotton yarn, flour, matches, and machinery when entrusting private factories with processing and ordering goods; and they must be carried out separately under a unified plan, strictly establishing and fulfilling contracts. Regarding the scope of state-owned trade, the meeting determined that in addition to operating six people's necessities, namely grain, yarn, cloth, oil, salt, and coal, other general merchandise should be operated with the support of cooperatives and private businesses should be encouraged to conduct legal operations. The meeting clearly stipulated that the main task of state-owned trading companies in the future is to stabilize prices and control price policies; banking credit and tax authorities must also improve their work around the task of adjusting industry and commerce.

In terms of labor-management relations, there are still some abnormal phenomena in various parts of the Northwest. Generally, workers in private factories have low enthusiasm for production, and individual factory workers have adopted inappropriate forms of struggle against the capitalists; the capitalists have a negative and complaining attitude and do not actively seek ways to improve management. Therefore, labor-management disputes have not been resolved reasonably. The labor-management consultation meetings that have been established in various private industrial and commercial enterprises also lack practical work content, and the steps taken by trade unions, labor bureaus, and industry and commerce bureaus in resolving labor-management relations are also inconsistent. Therefore, the meeting determined that the main steps for adjusting labor-management relations in the future are to strengthen the education of both labor and management on the policy of mutual benefit between labor and management, and to universally establish labor-management consultation meetings. In handling labor-management relations, the work of trade unions, labor bureaus, and industry and commerce bureaus should be clearly divided, and joint meetings should be convened regularly to solve production problems. In addition, the meeting decided to establish an arbitration committee to mediate disputes between labor and management.

At this meeting, reports on financial and economic work in the past six months from the subordinate departments, banks, bureaus, and provinces and cities were heard, and criticism and self-criticism were fully launched, and the erroneous understanding of the policy of taking into account both public and private interests was initially clarified. After full discussion, the meeting adopted six special reports on adjusting industry, commerce, loans, taxation, cooperatives, and labor-management relations.

　　西北财委举行二次会议
    讨论调整工商业
    确定首先调整产销公私劳资关系
    【新华社西安八日电】西北军政委员会财政经济委员会第二次会议于七月二十四日至三十一日在西安举行。这次会议的中心议题是巩固统一财经工作的成绩，并在这个基础上调整工商业。会议根据目前西北区工商业所存在的主要问题，确定首先从产销、公私和劳资三方面的关系上进行调整。
    在产销关系上，现在西北各地所存在的主要问题是盲目生产，产销脱节。几个重要的企业已形成生产滞销的现象。如面粉、火柴等业即有二十余厂因生产品滞销而停业或歇业，其他如煤矿等生产单位也存在着类此情况。因此，会议确定这些公私企业应在改进经营方法的基础上，贯彻“以销定产”的方针。现陕西关中面粉业及西北火柴业已经通过协商分配了产销数量。煤炭业即将开会确定产销范围。其他各种工业也准备依据自愿原则进行产销关系的调整。
    在公私关系上，目前政府和公营企业中某些干部的认识还有偏差。公营企业在委托私营工厂加工和向私营工厂订货中，存在单纯营业观点和救济观点，盲目地供给加工原料，没有严格责成被委托加工的私营工厂切实履行合同。此外，信贷工作方面也存在着脱离生产的盲目贷放现象，税收方面的畸重畸轻的情形也尚未消除。因此，会议确定公营企业委托私营工厂加工和向私营工厂订货，首先着重在纱布、面粉、火柴、机器等几种主要的工业；并须在统一计划下分别进行，严格订立合同与履行合同。关于国营贸易范围，会议确定除经营粮食、纱、布、油、盐、煤炭六种人民必需品外，其他百货应扶助合作社进行经营并鼓励私商进行合法经营。会议明确规定了国营贸易公司今后的主要任务在于稳定物价与掌握价格政策；银行信贷和税收机关也要围绕着调整工商业的任务而改进工作。
    在劳资关系上，目前西北各地还存在着若干不正常的现象。一般私营工厂中工人生产情绪不高，个别工厂的工人对资方曾采取不适当的斗争方式；资方则存在着消极抱怨的态度，不积极设法改善管理，因此，劳资纠纷尚未能合理解决。各私营工商业中已成立起来的劳资协商会议也缺少实际的工作内容，而工会、劳动局、工商局在解决劳资关系上所采取的步调也不一致。因此，会议确定今后调整劳资关系的主要步骤是加强劳资双方关于劳资两利政策的教育，普遍建立劳资协商会议。在处理劳资关系上，工会、劳动局与工商局的工作应明确划分，并经常召集联席会议，以解决生产中的问题。此外，会议决定成立仲裁委员会以调处劳资间的争议。
    此次会议曾听取了所属各部、行、局及各省市半年来财经工作的报告，充分展开批评与自我批评，初步澄清了对公私兼顾政策的错误认识。会议经过充分讨论后通过了调整工业、商业、贷款、税收、合作社、劳资关系等六个专题报告。
