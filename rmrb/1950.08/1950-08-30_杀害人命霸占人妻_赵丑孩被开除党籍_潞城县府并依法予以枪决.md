　　Murdering a Person and Seizing His Wife
    Zhao Chouhai Expelled from the Party
    The Lucheng County Government Executed Him According to Law

    Zhao Chouhai was from Yaoshang Village, Lucheng County, Shanxi Province. He was 22 years old and of peasant origin. During the land reform, he actively participated and joined the militia, later becoming a militia instructor. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1947. He consistently abused his power and took advantage of women in the village. In order to marry Sun Caifeng, he first stirred up discord between her and her husband. On September 1st last year, he used a knife to kill Sun Caifeng's husband, Lian Peile, in the field, resulting in a murder. After investigation and detection by the County Public Security Bureau, the interrogation confirmed the facts, and the criminal confessed to the crime. Zhao Chouhai's act of murdering a person is intolerable by law and Party discipline. The Lucheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party therefore decided to expel Zhao Chouhai from the Party. The Lucheng County People's Government, after holding a public trial in the city on August 22nd this year, executed him by firing squad according to law.

　　杀害人命霸占人妻
    赵丑孩被开除党籍
    潞城县府并依法予以枪决
    赵丑孩是山西潞城县窑上村人，现年二十二岁，农民出身。在土地改革中，因一时表现积极，参加民兵，后任民兵指导员。一九四七年参加中国共产党。他在村里一贯利用职权，玩弄女性。他为达到与孙彩凤结婚的目的，先挑拨她与丈夫不和。去年九月一日，他用小刀将孙彩凤之夫廉培乐在野地杀死，造成人命事件。经县公安局侦察破案，审讯属实，该犯亦供认不讳。赵丑孩的杀害人命的行为，为法纪党纪所不容。中共潞城县委会为此决定开除赵丑孩党籍。潞城县人民政府并于今年八月二十二日在城内召开公审大会后，依法执行枪决。
