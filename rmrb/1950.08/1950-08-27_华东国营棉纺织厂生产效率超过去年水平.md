Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th. The Shanghai seventeen cotton mills under the East China Textile Bureau have seen their production efficiency exceed the 1949 level in the past six months; however, due to the sole pursuit of quantity and neglect of improving the quality of finished products, the problem of substandard goods remains very serious. In the past six months, except for the first quarter's production plan, which was only 75 percent completed due to the "February 6th" bombing, the second quarter's cotton yarn production exceeded the plan by 2 percent, and cotton cloth production exceeded the plan by 1.4 percent. Production efficiency has exceeded the 1949 level. If calculated in terms of twelve-pound fine cloth, the average output per loom in 20 hours is 88 yards, an increase of 17.6 percent compared to 1949. The average cotton consumption per piece of 20-count yarn is 404 jin, which is 2.5 percent lower than the number specified by the National Textile Conference, and the power consumption per piece of yarn is also lower than in 1949. As a result, the unit cost of cotton yarn has been reduced compared to before. However, due to neglecting the improvement of the quality of finished products, the number of second-class products in June and July has increased compared to before. To this end, the East China Textile Bureau has held symposiums with factory directors, technicians, and worker representatives to specifically study improvement methods. The factory trade unions have also decided to launch an anti-substandard product campaign as the central work for the autumn. The work of eliminating substandard products is now actively underway.

　　华东国营棉纺织厂生产效率超过去年水平
    【新华社上海二十四日电】华东纺织管理局所属上海十七个棉纺织厂，半年来生产效率已超过一九四九年水平；但因单纯追求数量，忽视成品质量的提高，次货问题仍很严重。半年来，除第一季生产计划因受“二六”轰炸影响只完成原订计划百分之七十五外，第二季棉纱生产超过计划百分之二，棉布生产超过计划百分之一点四，生产效率已超过一九四九年的水平。如各种棉布折合十二磅细布计算。每台织机二十小时平均产量为八十八码，较一九四九年增加百分之十七点六。二十支纱每件平均用棉四百零四市斤，已低于全国纺织会议规定数的百分之二点五，每件纱用电量亦低于一九四九年。因而棉纱单位成本已较前减低。但由于忽视了成品质量的提高，六七两月份二等品已较前增多。为此，华东纺织管理局曾分别召开了各厂厂长、技术人员和工人代表座谈会，具体研究了改进办法。各厂工会也决定以开展反次货运动作为秋季中心工作。现消灭次货的工作正在积极进行中。
