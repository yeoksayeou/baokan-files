　　Preventing Electric Shock Incidents
　　Recently, there have been many electric shock casualties in Beijing. In the ten days before August 6th, there were thirteen incidents, resulting in fifteen injuries and deaths. Examining the causes of these electric shock incidents, the most significant factor is the serious bureaucratic style of work in some government agencies and enterprises, which disregards the safety of people's lives. For example, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the city privately installed electrical grids with unclear markings and no safety equipment, and discharged electricity during the day, leading to electric shock incidents. The Municipal Electricity Bureau neglected to inspect and repair the city's dilapidated power supply facilities and often failed to promptly repair them after discovering damage or deterioration, resulting in the death of some citizens from electric shock. If this bureaucratic style of work, which disregards the safety of people's lives, is not resolutely overcome, it will be impossible to completely prevent the continued occurrence of electric shock incidents.

　　Some citizens lack electrical knowledge and are careless in their daily lives. When electrical equipment malfunctions, they often attempt to repair it themselves, leading to many unnecessary electric shock casualties.

　　To effectively prevent electric shock incidents and protect the safety of people's lives, we suggest that the Public Security Bureau and the Electricity Bureau should first promptly formulate measures to regulate the installation of electrical grids. No agency should be allowed to install electrical grids without examination and approval. The Electricity Bureau should strengthen the management of all electrical supply stores in the city. Any electrical supply store that lacks sufficient electrical knowledge and technical qualifications should be ordered not to install electrical equipment for citizens. The Electricity Bureau should develop a strict inspection system and maintenance plan for all hazardous power supply facilities and should promptly repair or replace damaged parts and old wires.

　　The Electricity Bureau should also widely publicize electrical safety knowledge to citizens. When citizens discover damaged or malfunctioning electrical wires and equipment in their homes, they should immediately call upon specialized technicians for repairs. If they discover a dangerous condition in outdoor power supply facilities, they should also immediately report it to the Electricity Bureau or the nearest Public Security Bureau for repair.

　　The Public Security Bureau bears the greatest responsibility for the safety of citizens' lives, and the Electricity Bureau also has the responsibility to ensure that power supply facilities do not pose a danger and do not harm citizens. To ensure the safety of citizens, we first demand that these responsible agencies and enterprises earnestly assume their responsibilities. All citizens should also assist these agencies and enterprises in ensuring their own safety!

### 防止触电事件

　　防止触电事件
    北京市最近发生了不少触电伤亡事件。八月六日以前十天中，即发生了十三起，伤亡十五人。检查触电事件发生的原因，最主要的是有些机关和企业部门，存在严重的官僚主义作风，忽视人民的生命安全。例如市民政局私设电网，标志既不显明，又无安全设备，且日间放电，致造成触电事件。市电业局对本市腐朽的供电装置，平时既疏于检查与修整；已经发觉有破旧或损坏的情形，又往往不迅速修理，以致有的市民因此触电致死。这种忽视人民生命安全的官僚主义作风如不坚决加以克服，就不能彻底防止触电事件的继续发生。
    有些市民缺乏用电常识，平时麻痹大意，遇有供电器材发生故障，又往往私自装修，这也是造成许多不应有的触电伤亡事件的原因。
    为了有效地防止触电事件，保护人民生命的安全，我们建议：公安部门与电业部门首先应当迅速制定办法，管制电网的装设。除经过勘查批准者外，任何机关均不应擅自装设电网。电业局应加强对全市电料行的管理。凡无足够电业知识和技术条件的电料行，应限令它们不得装置市民用电设备。电业局对一切有危险性的供电装置，应拟定严格的检查制度和检修计划，对损坏的机件和破旧的电线应及时修理或更换。
    电业局还应当向市民广泛宣传用电常识。市民对于住宅中的电线和用电装置，发现残破不灵的时候，应随时招请专门技工修理；发现户外供电装置发生危险状态，亦应随时报告电业局或附近公安机关加以修理。
    公安局对市民的生命安全负有最大的责任；电业局同样也有责任保证供电装置不发生危险，不损伤市民。要保障市民的安全，我们首先要求这些负责机关和企业切实负起责任。全体市民也应当协助这些机关、企业，来保障自己的安全！
