Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 8th: Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces are currently cultivating and training land reform work cadres on a large scale.

　　The first group of over 1,800 students from the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Party School, after three months of study, graduated in July and will soon be assigned to participate in key experimental work for land reform. The Provincial Party Committee has now transferred 600 cadres above the district level, preparing to open the second phase of the Party School in mid-August. According to incomplete statistics in mid-July, the Fuzhou, Ganzhou, Ningdu, Nanchang and other special districts under Jiangxi Province have already trained 8,910 land reform work cadres.

　　In Hubei Province, more than 30 counties have opened county and district cadre rectification classes, with more than 3,000 people participating in the study. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China will also convene a meeting of party member representatives in early August, stipulating that cadres above the county committee level participate in rectification and study of the Land Reform Law. In addition, in order to cultivate a large number of rural grassroots cadres for land reform after the autumn harvest, various localities are absorbing peasant activists and poor rural intellectuals who have emerged from the rent reduction and anti-local tyrant movements for training. In the Huanggang Special District alone, thirteen counties have already trained more than 3,800 people.

　　After the basic conclusion of the rent reduction movement, six prefectural committees of the Communist Party of China in Hunan Province, including Changsha and Yiyang, also began the rectification and training of cadres. The main forms included meetings of party member representatives, enlarged cadre meetings, and training in batches. Through inspection, work summaries, and study of the Land Reform Law, the policy level of cadres was further improved and their work methods were improved. At present, the first phase of rural cadre training courses in some areas has ended, and about 2,000 cadres have been trained in nine counties including Changsha and Hengyang.

　　At present, the training of cadres in various places can be divided into two types: one is to train rural working cadres, and the other is to train peasant activists and poor intellectuals. The former mainly involves summarizing work, inspecting the implementation of policies, and launching criticism and self-criticism, focusing on criticizing behaviors that violate policies due to undesirable tendencies such as commandism and narrow empiricism. The cultivation and training of peasant activists and poor intellectuals mainly involves strengthening class education through venting grievances and calculating the exploitation accounts of landlords, and further learning how to divide rural classes and specific policy issues in the Land Reform Law.

　　江西湖北湖南等省大批训练土改干部
    【新华社汉口八日电】江西、湖北、湖南各省正在大批培养和训练土地改革工作干部。
    中共江西省委党校首批学员一千八百多人，经过三个月的学习，已在七月份结业，即将分配参加土地改革的重点实验工作。现在省委又抽调区级以上干部六百名，准备在八月中旬开办第二期党校。据七月中旬不完全统计，江西省所属抚州、赣州、宁都、南昌等专区，也已经训练土地改革工作干部八千九百一十名。
    湖北省已经有三十多个县开办了县、区干部整风班，参加学习的有三千多人。中共湖北省委会也将在八月初旬召开党员代表会议，规定县委以上干部参加，进行整风和土地改革法的学习。另外，为了大批培养秋后进行土地改革的乡村基层干部，各地正吸收在减租、反恶霸运动中涌现出来的农民积极分子和农村贫苦知识分子加以训练，仅黄冈专区十三个县就已经训练了三千八百多人。
    湖南省中共长沙、益阳等六个地委，也在减租运动基本上结束以后开始了干部的整训工作。主要是以党员代表会议、扩大干部会议和分批轮训等形式，通过检查、总结工作和学习土地改革法，进一步提高干部的政策水平，并改进干部的工作方法。目前部分地区第一期乡村干部轮训班已经结束，长沙、衡阳等九个县受训干部约有两千人。
    目前各地干部的训练可分为两种类型：一种是训练农村在职干部，另一种是训练农民积极分子和贫苦知识分子。前一种主要是通过总结工作，检查政策的执行情形，展开批评和自我批评，其中着重地批判因为命令主义、狭隘经验主义的不良倾向，而发生的违犯政策的行为。对于农民积极分子和贫苦知识分子的培养和训练，主要是通过诉苦和算地主的剥削账，加强阶级教育，进一步学习如何划分农村阶级和土地改革法中的具体政策问题。
