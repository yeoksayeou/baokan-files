[Shenyang News] *Northeast Daily* reports: The Northeast Bank convened its eighth joint conference of branch managers from July 21st to August 3rd to summarize the work of the first half of the year and determine the tasks for the second half. The meeting was conducted in the spirit of rectification, focusing on examining the shortcomings and deviations in the General Bank's leadership in implementing policies and its work style. The aim was to analyze problems, conduct discussions, learn from experience, improve work, and further strengthen the Northeast financial leadership organs.

At the meeting, preliminary inspections were carried out on agricultural loans, credit, cash management, planning work, and organizational structure. The meeting believes that the Northeast Bank's work in the past six months has been successful, and this is the main aspect. This is reflected in the fact that since the implementation of new business, the bank has become the center of national cash management, credit, and fund transfers, not only vigorously promoting enterprise production but also initially playing a supervisory role over enterprise production. In conjunction with the government's agricultural production plan this year, over 1.3 trillion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) of spring plowing loans were issued, effectively solving the difficulties that the vast number of farmers could not solve themselves in agricultural production, and playing an active role in promoting the completion and exceeding of the 1950 agricultural production task.

However, there have also been many shortcomings and deviations in the work of the past six months. The root cause is mainly due to the lack of investigation and research spirit on the part of the leadership, especially the General Bank of Northeast Bank, and insufficient understanding of the situation, resulting in inaccurate plans and work being divorced from reality. In addition, before the work was deployed, instructions on important links were not clear enough, and there was a lack of timely supervision and inspection to quickly help lower levels solve problems, which was reflected in the specific work as a great deal of blindness. For example, in the work of preparing agricultural loans, due to the lack of a correct understanding of the financial resources and needs of the masses, the loan figures were simply determined based on the government plan, resulting in a serious waste of funds. There was also a great deal of blindness in the promotion of new-style improved farm tools, as well as a phenomenon of emphasizing quantity over quality, resulting in a waste of manpower and resources and causing dissatisfaction among the masses with the bank. In the loan work for Northeast-level enterprises, although it generally adapted to the overall production plan, in the credit work of specific units, there was still a phenomenon of being too loose or too tight due to insufficient understanding of the situation. For example, some units did not use the loans they received, some units used more loans than they needed, and some individual units requested credit that should have been resolved but was not, which affected production.

Second half of the year work guidelines: Steadily expand the bank network from cities to villages, from factories to mines.

The general meeting summarized, in addition to drawing on past experiences, and determined the work guidelines for the second half of 1950: from cities to villages, from factories to mines, according to conditions, focus on steadily expanding the organization of the bank network. In order to achieve this goal, the following specific tasks were determined for the second half of the year: (1) In bank loan work, it is necessary to regularly study and analyze the situation, cooperate with the needs of the five types of economic development, focus on controlling credit, promoting production, supervising the use of funds, and preventing improper backlog. Before the state has determined the budget for reserve materials, the bank will provide credit solutions for legitimate backlogs according to its own capabilities, and at the same time, cancel overdraft credit and handle all loan procedures through regular loans. In addition to economic credit loans for Northeast-level enterprises that are conditionally still in accordance with the original plan, the amount of credit for local enterprises will be increased by 600 billion yuan, and the amount of loans for private industrial and commercial enterprises will be increased by 100 billion yuan; and vigorously absorb private deposits. In general, Northeast-level and provincial/municipal-level enterprises that are not settlement accounts will not be granted loans; and loans for settlement accounts must also be approved based on their production plans, financial plans, product quality, and sales conditions, under the condition of having physical guarantees, in order to prevent bad debts. At the same time, the credit execution banks in the locations of Northeast-level and provincial/municipal-level enterprises should supervise the loan usage of their credit clients, stipulate the loan dates, and be responsible for collecting payments. If improper loan usage is found during inspection, or if the loan is not guaranteed to be repaid, the matter should be immediately reported to the higher level, and after approval, the loan may be stopped. (2) In bank accounting work, the settlement should be further combined the Northeast-level settlement accounts with the provincial/municipal-level settlement accounts in order to expand the scope of credit allocation and accelerate material turnover. If provincial/municipal enterprises have deposits in settlement allocation, the provincial/municipal enterprises can propose a cash plan, and the bank will provide a solution to the cash problem. In addition, vigorously organize deposit savings work, consolidate and expand prize-winning savings, reduce remittance fees, grasp remittance situation, and plan to connect intra- and extra-regional remittances. (3) In order to develop the rural economy and revitalize rural finance, after approval by the Northeast People's Government, rural financial institutions will be established conditionally and with emphasis to handle short-term deposit and loan matters in rural areas, so as to plan to eliminate the high-interest loan phenomenon caused by insufficient funds in rural areas. (4) Cash management work should penetrate into the military departments (but not relax enterprise departments), and cooperate with the logistics departments and financial departments to handle it. At the same time, further understand the cash receipts and payments situation in urban and rural areas and carry out appropriate management.

In order to ensure the smooth completion of the above tasks, the meeting believes that it is necessary to strengthen planning work, improve the planning institutions at all levels, and establish inspection institutions at all levels to correctly implement policies. At the same time, plan to enrich cadres, improve quality, use old cadres as the backbone, boldly use new cadres, and formulate work standards, and promote rationalization proposals.

　　东北银行召开经理会议
    结合整风检查工作
    上半年工作存在很大盲目性今后将加强计划性
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北银行为总结上半年工作，确定下半年工作任务，曾于七月二十一日至八月三日召开了第八次各分支行经理联席会议。会议是以贯彻整风精神来进行的，着重在检查总行领导在执行政策上，工作作风上存在的缺点和偏差；从中分析问题、进行讨论，以求吸取经验，改进工作，进一步健全东北金融领导机关。
    会上，初步检查了农贷、信贷、现金管理、计划工作及组织机构等。会议认为：东北银行半年来的工作是有成绩的，而且是主要的一面。这表现在执行新业务以来，使银行成为了国家现金管理、信贷、划拨清算的中心，不仅大力推进企业生产，并初步起到对企业生产的监督作用；结合政府今年的农业生产计划，发放春耕贷款一万三千余亿元（东北币、下同），有效地解决了广大农民在农业生产中自己所不能解决的困难，对完成与超过一九五○年农业生产任务，起了积极推动的作用。
    但是，半年来工作中也存在着许多缺点和偏差。产生的根源，主要是由于领导上，首先是东北银行总行缺乏调查研究精神，掌握情况不足，因此造成计划不精确，工作与实际脱节。加之在工作布置之前，对重要环节问题指示不够明确，同时又缺乏及时督促检查，迅速帮助下级解决问题，因而反映在具体工作中，存在着很大的盲目性。譬如在农贷备实工作中，由于对群众的资力与需求缺乏正确了解，单纯地依据政府计划确定贷款数字，因此造成严重的资金浪费现象。关于推广新式改良农具，亦存在很大盲目性及重量不重质的现象，结果，浪费人力、物力，使群众对银行不满。在东北一级企业贷款工作上，虽然一般地是适应了整个生产计划，但是在具体单位的信贷工作上，因为情况了解不足，还存在过松过紧现象。如有的单位贷了款不用，有的单位贷的多用的少，也有个别单位要求信贷，应解决而未予以解决，结果影响了生产。
    下半年工作方针  从城市到乡村，从工厂到矿山，稳步扩大银行网。
    大会总结，除吸取了以往经验，并且确定一九五○年下半年的工作方针为：从城市到乡村，从工厂到矿山，根据条件，有重点地稳步扩大银行网的组织。为了实现这个方针，因此确定下半年具体任务：（一）银行贷款工作，要经常研究分析情况，配合五种经济发展需要，有重点地掌握信贷，促进生产，监督资金运用，防止不正当的积压，而在国家还未确定预备物资预算以前，对于正当的积压，银行根据自己力量酌予信贷解决，同时取消透支信贷，一律通过定期放款手续办理。信贷数目除东北一级企业有条件地仍按原计划经济信贷外，地方企业信贷数目增加六千亿元，私人工商业贷款增加一千亿元；并大力吸收私人存款。信贷对象，一般地东北一级和省、市级企业，不是结算户不予贷款；而结算户贷款，也必须根据其生产计划、财务计划、产品质量、推销情况等，在有实物保证的条件下，才能批准贷款，以防止呆账。同时，东北一级和省、市级企业所在地之信贷执行银行，则应对信贷户监督其贷款用途，规定贷款日期，并负责催收。如在检查中发现贷款用途不当，贷款无保证归还时，应即切实报告上级，批准后，可停止贷款。（二）银行会计工作，在结算上要进一步将东北一级结算户与省、市级结算户结合起来，以便扩大信贷调拨范围，加速物资周转。如果省、市企业在结算调拨有存款时，省、市企业可以提出现金计划，银行给予解决现金问题。另外，大力组织存款储蓄工作，巩固与扩大有奖储蓄，并减低汇水，掌握汇兑情况，有计划地沟通区内外汇兑。（三）为了发展农村经济，活跃农村金融，呈请东北人民政府批准后，有条件有重点地成立农村金融机构，办理农村短期存放款事宜，以便有计划地消灭农村中因资金不足而产生的高利贷现象。（四）现金管理工作，应深入到军事部门（但不放松企业部门），协同后勤部门与财政部门处理。同时，进一步了解城乡现金收付情况，进行适当管理。
    为了保证上述任务的顺利完成，会议认为：必须加强计划工作，健全上下计划机构，并建立各级检查机构，正确贯彻政策。同时，有计划地充实干部，提高质量，以老干部为骨干，大胆使用新干部，并制定工作标准，提倡合理化建议。
