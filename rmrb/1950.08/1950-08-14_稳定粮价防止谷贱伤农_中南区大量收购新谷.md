Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 13th: To prevent farmers from being hurt by low grain prices, state-owned grain companies in the South-Central Region have begun purchasing new grain in large quantities, effectively stabilizing grain prices.

Due to the widespread bumper harvest in the South-Central Region this year (the harvest in the lakefront counties of Hunan has doubled compared to last year), the amount of new grain entering the market in various regions has exceeded that of previous years by one to two times. In addition, a small number of speculative merchants have taken the opportunity to manipulate the market, leading to a general sharp decline in grain prices. In Shaoyang, Hunan, in late July, the market price of new grain fell from 51,000 yuan to 41,000 yuan per 100 jin. In Changsha, starting from the 1st of this month, the market price fell from 55,000 yuan to below 39,000 yuan per 100 jin. Grain prices in other regions have also declined, affecting the decline in prices of other grains.

Since the state-owned grain companies in various regions correctly grasped grain prices and proceeded with purchases, the trend of sharp grain price declines in most regions has been reversed. In Wuhan city, from July 20th to 28th, the grain price fell from 520 yuan to 408 yuan per jin. After the grain company successively raised prices and purchased more than 760,000 jin, the price per jin had risen back to 470 yuan by the 4th of this month. The Guangzhou City Grain Company hung a price of 80,000 yuan per shi dan for purchases, and the market price has risen from over 60,000 yuan per shi dan on the 2nd of this month to over 72,000 yuan. The Changsha Grain Company began purchasing on the morning of the 3rd of this month, and in the afternoon, the market price of new grain per jin immediately rose from 370 yuan to 400 yuan.

As of now, only in provinces such as Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Hubei, due to the state-owned grain companies starting purchases later or not yet having started purchases, the new grain market in some towns and cities is still considered too low. In areas where purchases have begun, the market still has a large accumulation of new grain that cannot be sold due to the state-owned grain companies not paying enough attention to uniting private merchants to vigorously transport and sell grain. For example, Guangzhou City accumulated more than 10 million dan from the 1st to the 7th of this month. Currently, the South-Central Region Grain Company has instructed its branches in various regions that the purchase of new grain must be taken as a major political task at present, preventing delays and slackness. During the purchase process, the state-owned grain companies should focus on stabilizing prices and vigorously unite and organize private merchants to freely transport and sell grain in large quantities, especially to grain-deficient areas, without violating government price policies. In addition, the standard quality of new grain is stipulated, with a moisture content not exceeding 13% to 14% and impurities not exceeding 1% to 1.5%. Higher prices should be paid for good quality grain, and discounts should be applied for inferior quality grain, preventing indiscriminate purchases regardless of quality.

### 稳定粮价防止谷贱伤农  中南区大量收购新谷

　　稳定粮价防止谷贱伤农
    中南区大量收购新谷
    【新华社汉口十三日电】中南区各地国营粮食公司为防止谷贱伤农，已开始大量收购新谷，有效地稳定了粮价。
    由于今年中南区普遍丰收（湖南滨湖各县收成比去年增加一倍），各地新谷上市量均较往年超过一倍至二倍以上，加以少数投机商人乘机操纵，以致普遍发生粮价猛跌的现象。湖南邵阳七月下旬，每百斤新谷市价由五万一千元跌到四万一千元。长沙本月一日起，市价每百斤由五万五千元降至三万九千元以下。其他地区谷价亦有下降现象，并影响其他粮食价格跌落。
    自各地国营粮食公司正确的掌握粮价，进行收购后，大部地区粮价猛跌的趋势已经扭转。武汉市区七月二十日至二十八日，谷价曾由每斤五百二十元跌到四百零八元，经粮食公司先后提价收购七十六万余斤后，至本月四日，每斤价格已经回升到四百七十元。广州市粮食公司每市担挂牌八万元进行收购，市价已由本月二日的每市担六万余元，回升到七万二千余元。长沙粮食公司本月三日上午开始收购，下午每斤新谷市价即由三百七十元回升到四百元。
    截至目前止，仅有广西、江西、湖北等省，由于国营粮食公司收购较迟，或尚未进行收购，一部分城镇新谷市场仍嫌过低。已开始收购地区，因国营粮食公司对团结私商大力运销注意不够，以致市场仍积存大量新谷，无法销售。如广州市本月一日至七日即积存达一千余万担。现中南区粮食公司已指示各地分支机构，必须将收购新谷作为当前重大政治任务，防止迟缓、懈怠；在收购中，国营粮食公司以稳定价格为主，应大力团结、组织私商，在不违背政府价格政策下，大量自由运销，特别是外运缺粮区。此外，并规定新谷标准质量，水份不能超过百分之十三至十四；杂质不能超过百分之一至一点五。好的提价，次的折扣，防止不问质量的滥收。
