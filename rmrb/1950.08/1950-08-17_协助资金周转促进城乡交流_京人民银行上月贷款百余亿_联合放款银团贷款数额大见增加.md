　　Assisting Capital Turnover and Promoting Urban-Rural Exchange
    Beijing People's Bank Loaned Over 10 Billion Last Month
    Joint Loan Syndicate Saw a Significant Increase in Loan Amounts
    [Beijing Municipal News Agency] Since the People's Bank of Beijing Branch expanded the scope of its lending, the loan figures have increased month by month. In July, it loaned out more than 12.4 billion yuan, 30% more than in June, and 50% more than the total for April and May. These loans have played a certain role in assisting the capital turnover of private industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing and promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, as well as export trade.
    In July, the number of commercial households receiving loans increased significantly, with 200 households receiving general loans totaling over 3.3 billion yuan; 18 households receiving discount loans totaling over 500 million yuan; and 68 exporters receiving loans totaling over 4.5 billion yuan through the Bank of China. Some of the merchants who received loans transported and sold grain and rural by-products to Henan, Suiyuan and other places, while some established merchants, such as the Zhonghua Department Store, used 70 million yuan in loans to purchase industrial products from other places, increasing the variety and quantity of goods in their stores, and doubling their daily sales revenue compared to before. In July, 266 industrial households received loans totaling more than 3.5 billion yuan; and 127 specialty handicraft households received loans totaling more than 560 million yuan through the Bank of China. Factories that received loans, such as the Huadong Textile and Dyeing Factory, used the loans to purchase yarn in Tianjin, ensuring an adequate supply of raw materials. Since launching a production competition at the beginning of this month, the best results have seen output exceeding the usual level by 20%.
    In order to widely publicize the state bank's policy of supporting private industrial and commercial enterprises and to improve shortcomings in its lending work, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank convened symposiums in July with the directors and supervisors of more than 40 industry associations, including hardware, electrical materials, and machinery, as well as the responsible persons of several factories and stores. Yin Yukun, the deputy manager of the bank, explained the spirit and specific methods of lending. In addition to expressing heartfelt support and gratitude for the state bank's policy of supporting private industrial and commercial enterprises, those in attendance also put forward many suggestions for improvement. Based on these opinions, the bank has made new improvements to its lending methods, such as: simplifying procedures and shortening the time for investigating loan applicants, striving to complete the process within three days; providing credit loans to factories and stores with good credit and management; and, in the case of mortgage loans, adopting an on-site sealing method for collateral based on the situation of the factory or store, so as to avoid round-trip transportation and increase the burden on loan applicants. In addition, small overdrafts can also be handled at discretion.
    [Another dispatch] Since the Beijing Municipal Public-Private Banking Joint Loan Syndicate held its first general meeting on July 11 and corrected the shortcomings of overly strict lending conditions, lending has shown progress. As of the 11th of this month, a total of 33 loans have been issued in one month, totaling more than 1.43 billion yuan, doubling the amount issued by the group during the two and a half months from its establishment on May 1 to July 11. The loans that have matured, with the exception of a very small number that have been rolled over, have mostly been recovered on schedule.

　　协助资金周转促进城乡交流
    京人民银行上月贷款百余亿
    联合放款银团贷款数额大见增加
    【京市新闻处讯】人民银行北京分行自扩大贷款范围后，贷款数字逐月增加，七月份共贷出一百二十四亿余元，比六月份多百分之三十，比四、五两月合计多百分之五十。这些贷款，对协助京市私营工商业资金周转和城乡物资交流、出口贸易起了一定的作用。
    七月份贷款，商业户已大为增多，计一般贷款有二百户，共三十三亿余元；押汇十八户，共五亿余元；经中国银行贷款给出口商六十八户，共四十五亿余元。得到贷款的商户，有的到豫绥等地运销食粮和农村副产品，有些座商如中华百货售品所则用七千万元贷款，到外地采购工业品，增添门市货物的种类和数量，每天售货流水额比以前增加一倍。工业贷款在七月份有二百六十六户，共放出三十五亿余元；经中国银行贷给特种手工艺一百二十七户，共五亿六千余万元。获得贷款的工厂，如华东染织厂，用贷款去天津购纱，充足原料，自本月初旬展开生产竞赛后，成绩最好时产量曾超过平时百分之二十。
    人民银行北京分行为了广泛宣传国家银行扶植私营工商业的政策和改进放款工作中的缺点，在七月里曾分别召集五金、电料、机器等四十余业公会理监事及若干工厂、商店负责人，举行座谈会。由该行副经理殷玉昆说明贷款精神和具体办法。到会的除对国家银行扶植私营工商业的政策表示衷心拥护与感激外，并提出了许多改进意见。该行根据这些意见对贷款方法又有新的改善，如：简化手续，缩短对申请贷款户的调查时间，争取在三天内办好；有信用的，经营好的工厂商店，可做信用贷款；如做抵押贷款，则根据工厂、商店情况把抵押品采取原地封存办法，以免往返运输，增加贷款户负担。此外，小额透支也可酌情办理。
    【又讯】京市公私营银钱业联合放款银团，自七月十一日举行第一次全体大会纠正放款条件过于严格的缺点后，贷款已见开展。到本月十一日止，一个月内共贷出三十三笔，计十四亿三千余万元，比该团自五月一日成立到七月十一日止两个半月期间一共放出数额增加一倍。已经到期的放款，除极少数转期外，大部分已经如期收回。
