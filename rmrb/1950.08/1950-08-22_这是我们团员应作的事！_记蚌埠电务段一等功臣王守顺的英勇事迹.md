"This is what we League members should do!"
    Remembering the heroic deeds of Wang Shoushun, a first-class meritorious worker of the Bengbu Electrical Section
    Comrade Wang Shoushun is an outstanding communications worker in the communications section of the Bengbu Electrical Section. He joined the Communist Youth League this February.
    In mid-July, the Bengbu area experienced continuous heavy rains, and the power lines under the Míngguāng Bridge on the Huainan Railway were about to be flooded. The section sent Wang Shoushun and seven other workers to re-string the lines. The water flow under the Míngguāng Bridge was very rapid, making the work very difficult. However, under the leadership of Comrade Wang Shoushun, they overcame the difficulties and strung sixteen lines on the 500-meter-long Míngguāng Bridge in three and a half days, completing the task a day and a half ahead of the administrative plan.
    Next, the power lines under the Huai River Bridge on the Jinpu Railway also needed to be re-strung onto the iron bridge above. On July 23, the workers arrived at the site and found the work even more difficult. Because the power lines here had to be nailed to the triangular iron piers with screws, the workers had to work on an iron pole more than three meters above the water surface. The water under the bridge was large and rapid, and if one was not careful, falling down would be life-threatening. The workers had to pull a copper wire from the south end of the bridge to the north end, and they had to carry the wire on their backs while climbing the bridge frame; however, the bridge was 700 meters long, and the bridge frame was only a little over a foot wide, and the water flowing underneath was roaring. Everyone felt a little flustered when they heard it. Just as everyone was anxious, Old Wang said, "Comrades, I'll climb first. As long as you're not afraid in your heart, there's no danger." After saying that, he carried the copper wire on his back and climbed onto the bridge frame. Others saw the rolling river water and then looked at him carrying a copper wire and climbing north on the bridge frame, and they were worried for him. But he kept climbing step by step. An hour later, he crossed the bridge. When he came back, he smiled and encouraged his fellow workers, "Be bold. If we don't look down, but look at the bridge frame in front of us, we will definitely not be afraid." After saying that, he carried another copper wire on his back and said, "I'll climb in front, and you follow me behind, don't panic." The workers all followed him and climbed over. That day, they hung a total of three pairs of wires.
    By the morning of the 25th, the task of stringing the lines on the Huai River Bridge had not yet been completed, and another message came from the section saying that two electric poles on the Lóngzǐ River Bridge between Bengbu and Chánghuáiwèi and nearby were about to be washed down by the water. Civil engineer Wang Jinxián discussed with everyone, "We should transfer three people to pull the lines and straighten these two electric poles first." Comrade Wang Shoushun also participated in this emergency task. After lunch, everyone arrived at the site and saw that the electric poles were seven meters away from the roadbed, with a water pit more than five meters deep beside them, and the water was so rapid that people would be washed away as soon as they went down. Everyone said that there was no way to do it. Wang Shoushun stayed silent for a while and said, "I have a suggestion: can't we just walk over from the overhead line on a certain electric pole nearby?" Everyone scrambled to say, "This is a very good idea, but who dares to go up and do it?" Old Wang said, "I made the suggestion, so I'll do it." He ran to the bridge repair site of the engineering section, found a wooden board more than two feet long, twisted the ends with iron wire, and left more than two feet of iron wire at each end. He carried the wooden board on his back, climbed onto a certain electric pole from a shallow place, hooked the iron wires at both ends of the wooden board on the electric wires, sat on the wooden board himself, pulled the electric wires with both hands, and slowly moved forward. The comrades standing on the roadbed felt a little heartbeat and stared at him in amazement. When he moved to the place where the sag between the two electric wires was greater, it became difficult to move forward, and he felt very strenuous. However, Comrade Wang Shoushun finally reached that electric pole after an hour of effort. He was extremely tired and rested on it for ten minutes before starting to pull the line. It took him a lot of effort to straighten the electric pole. When he finally climbed onto the roadbed, he was exhausted and collapsed on the ground to rest. But the task of straightening another electric pole had not yet been completed. Comrade Wang Jinxián said, "Let someone else do it!" But no one dared to go up. Wang Shoushun stood up again and said, "I'll do it." Victory belongs to those who are brave and fearless. By 7:00 p.m., he had completed the task.
    The next day, Wang Shoushun came to work again with a pale face. The foreman of the work area, Section Chief Fāng, and his fellow workers all advised him to go home and have a good rest. But he said, "The task of re-stringing the lines on the bridge has not yet been completed! Everyone is working hard, and it's not right for me to rest alone!" Encouraged by him, the workers completed the original plan of stringing sixteen lines in seven days on the 700-meter-long Huai River Bridge in four days.
    The rescue task was successfully completed. On August 2, the section held a commendation meeting, and everyone unanimously rated him as a first-class meritorious worker. The workers asked him, "Old Wang, why do you work so hard?" He said with a smile, "This is what we League members should do!"

　　“这是我们团员应作的事！”
    记蚌埠电务段一等功臣王守顺的英勇事迹
    王守顺同志是蚌埠电务段通信工区一个优秀的通信工人。今年二月他参加了青年团。
    七月中旬，蚌埠地区接连下大雨，淮南铁路明光桥下的电线即刻要被水淹没了。工区就派王守顺等八个工人去改架线路。明光桥下水流很急，工作很不容易做。但他们在王守顺同志带头之下，终于克服困难，以三天半的时间在五百米长的明光桥上架线十六条，比行政上的计划提早一天半完成。
    接着，津浦铁路淮河大桥下的电线也要改架到铁桥上边来。七月二十三日，工友们到了工地，发觉这个工作困难更多。因为这里的电线须用螺丝钉钉在三角铁的桥墩上；工友们要在一根离水面三米余的铁杆子上干活，桥下水又大又急，一不小心，跌下去就有生命危险。而工友们要把一条铜线由桥南头扯到桥北头，一定要背着电线爬桥架；但桥长七百米，桥架仅一尺余宽，下面大水流得呼呼的响，谁一听见心里也有点发慌。大家正发急时，老王说：“同志们，我先爬。只要心里不害怕，就没有危险。”说完，他就背上铜线，爬上桥架。别人看见那滚滚的河水，再看他背着一条铜线在桥架上往北爬的情形，都为他耽忧。但他总是一步一步地爬着。一小时后，他爬过了大桥。他回来时，他笑着鼓励工友们说：“大胆些。我们不往下面看，看着前面桥架子，就绝对不会害怕。”说完，他又背上一条铜线说：“我在前头爬，你们在后面跟着我，别发慌。”工友都跟着他爬过去了。这一天，他们共挂上了三对线。
    到二十五日上午，淮河大桥架线的任务还没有完成，段内又传来消息，说蚌埠和长淮卫之间的龙子河桥跟附近有二根电杆，马上要被水冲倒。工务员王进贤和大家商量说：“我们应抽调三个人先将这二根电杆拉线扶正。”王守顺同志又去参加了这个突击任务。吃过午饭，大家到了工地一看，电杆离路基七米远，旁边有五米多深的水坑，水势又是那么急，人一下去就会被水冲跑。大家都说没有办法干了。王守顺呆了半晌说：“我提一个意见：我们由附近的某号电杆上的架空线上走过去，不就行了吗？”大家抢着说：“这个办法很好，但谁敢上去干呢？”老王说：“我提的意见，我就去干。”他跑到工务段修桥的地方，找出一块二尺多长的木板用铁丝拧住两头，每头又留铁丝二尺余长。他背着这块木板，从水浅的地方爬上某号电杆，将木板两头的铁丝钩在电线上，自己坐上木板，两手拉着电线，慢慢地向前移上。站在路基上的同志感觉有点心跳，都目瞪口呆的看着他。他移到两根电线中间垂度更大的地方时，再往前移动就不容易了，他感到非常吃力。可是王守顺同志经一个钟头的努力，终于到了那根电杆上。他身体累极了，在上面休息了十分钟，就开始拉线，他费了很大的气力，才将那根电杆扶正。到他最后爬上路基时，他已精疲力尽，就倒在地上休息。但扶正另一电杆的任务还没有完成。王进贤同志说：“换个人干吧！”但没人敢上去。王守顺又站起来说：“还是我来。”胜利是属于英勇无畏的人们的，至当晚七点钟，他完成了任务。
    第二天，王守顺带着苍白的脸又来上班了。工区领工员、方工长以及工友们都劝他回家好好地休息。但他说：“大桥上改线的任务还未完成呢！大伙儿都在干，我一人休息，这说不过去呀！”工友们在他的鼓舞下，四天内在长达七百米的淮河大桥上完成了原计划七天架线十六条的任务。
    抢修任务胜利地完成了。八月二日，段内召开了评功大会，大家一致评他为一等功臣。工友们问他：“老王，你为什么这样卖力气干呢？”他笑嘻嘻地说：“这是我们团员应作的事！”
