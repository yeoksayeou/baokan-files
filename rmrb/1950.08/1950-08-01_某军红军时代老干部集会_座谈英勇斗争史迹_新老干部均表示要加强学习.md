　　A Certain Army's Old Red Army Cadres Gather
    Symposium on the History of Heroic Struggle
    New and Old Cadres Expressed the Need to Strengthen Learning
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] A certain army of the North China Military Region, in order to collect historical data of the People's Liberation Army since the "August 1st" Army Day, and to encourage old cadres to strengthen cultural learning, convened a symposium of old Red Army cadres on June 20th. A total of twenty-seven cadres attended the meeting, which lasted for three days. The first two days were devoted to discussions and separate sorting of historical materials. On the third day, a meeting of cadres at the regimental level and above directly under the army was held. At the meeting, the old cadres were welcomed into the seats of honor with warm applause and presented with big red flowers. The chairman, in his opening remarks, said: "For more than twenty years, the People's Liberation Army has grown from nothing, from small to large, from guerrilla forces to powerful regular corps, from counter-encirclement and suppression to achieving basic national victory. The old comrades bravely sacrificed and worked hard, paving the way for our victory. In the future, they will lead us to socialism. We are listening to the reports of the old comrades today in order to understand history and learn from history." Then, the old cadres reported on the historical facts of revolutionary struggle. Li Zhiyuan, Political Commissar of a certain division, Yan Qingti, Political Commissar of a certain division, Li Decai, Deputy Division Commander of a certain division, and Li Kelin, Commander of a certain regiment, all made reports. The glorious deeds of heroic sacrifice and arduous struggle vividly educated the new cadres present at the meeting. Many comrades were moved to tears and expressed their desire to learn from the old cadres. In the speeches and reports of the army leaders and every old comrade, they all humbly reviewed their shortcomings, expressed their determination not to be arrogant and take credit, but to attribute the credit to the Party and the people; and expressed that they would strive to learn new things and improve their culture in the future. The Army Headquarters Political Department also invited the old cadres to a dinner, took commemorative photos, and presented each person with a souvenir album and a set of consolation items.
