　　Four Public Cemeteries Established in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Floating Coffin Placement in Temples or Burial within the City Now Prohibited
    [This newspaper reports] According to a message from the Municipal News Office: The Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau has established four public cemeteries in the suburbs, and will handle the matter of acquiring burial plots from August 1st. In the future, it is forbidden to place floating coffins in temples or to bury them within the city. The four public cemeteries are (1) the East Suburb Cemetery, located east of the Chaowai Bridge in the 13th District; (2) the South Suburb Cemetery, located in Wudian Village outside Yongdingmen in the 14th District; (3) the West Suburb First Cemetery, located in Yuegezhuang outside Guang'anmen in the 15th District; (4) the West Suburb Second Cemetery, located in Babaoshan in the 19th District. According to the "Beijing Municipal Public Cemetery Management Rules" formulated by the Civil Affairs Bureau, all applicants for burial plots must first fill out an application form, together with a death certificate issued by the Bureau of Public Health or a coroner's report from the court, and submit it to the local district government for approval before paying the fee to acquire a plot for burial. After approval from the Civil Affairs Bureau or the local district government, the applicant shall pay a permanent rental fee equivalent to the wholesale price of 100 jin of millet. Impoverished citizens who are unable to pay the fee may be granted a free burial plot with a certificate from a district-level government or higher. In order to accommodate the custom of "joint burial", the legal spouse of the deceased may pre-purchase a longevity plot for joint burial. The fee for the longevity plot is the same as for a burial plot. The public cemeteries are divided into three areas: general citizen area, Hui (Muslim) area, and cadre area. (Guo Peng)

    【本报讯】市新闻处消息：京市人民政府民政局已在城郊设立公墓四处，自八月一日起办理领穴葬埋事宜；今后禁止再在寺庙浮厝或在城内埋葬。四处公墓为（一）东郊公墓，在十三区朝外大桥以东；（二）南郊公墓，在十四区永定门外庑甸村；（三）西郊第一公墓，在十五区广安门外岳各庄；（四）西郊第二公墓，在十九区八宝山。根据民政局所制订的《北京市立公墓管理规则》，凡申请承领墓穴者须先填具申请书，连同公共卫生局核发之死亡证或法院之检验证送经当地区政府核准后即可缴费领穴营葬；领穴人经民政局或当地区政府核准后，应按伏地小米一百斤的批发价缴纳永租费，凡贫苦无力交费之市民，取得区以上政府之证明者，准予免费领穴。为了照顾“合葬”习俗，被葬人之正式配偶可预领寿穴以备合葬。其寿穴收费，与墓穴同。公墓划为一般市民区，回民区和干部区三种。（郭鹏）
