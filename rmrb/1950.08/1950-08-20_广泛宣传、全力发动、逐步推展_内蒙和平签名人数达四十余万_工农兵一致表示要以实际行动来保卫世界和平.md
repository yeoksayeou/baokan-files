　　Extensive Publicity, Full Mobilization, Gradual Promotion
    Peace Signatures in Inner Mongolia Reach Over 400,000
    Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Unanimously Express Their Determination to Defend World Peace with Practical Actions
    [Our Newspaper] According to the Inner Mongolia Daily: The peace signature campaign in Inner Mongolia officially began on May 18th. Over the past eighty days, through the full mobilization and extensive publicity by Party and government leading organs at all levels and mass organizations, as of now, according to incomplete statistics, the number of participants has reached 432,006, exceeding one-sixth of the total population of Inner Mongolia. Among them, the number of signatures in Xing'an League is the largest, totaling more than 217,000, accounting for more than 50% of the total number of signatures in Inner Mongolia; in Xing'an League, the number of signatures in Tuquan County ranks first, with 86,656, reaching 63% of the county's total population.

    During the entire movement, Party and government leading organs at all levels and mass organizations closely cooperated and formulated specific steps for carrying out the campaign. Generally, they first conducted current affairs studies among cadres and personnel, and then organized forces to go deep into the masses to carry out publicity; first, they launched the campaign in cities, and then gradually expanded it to rural areas or grasslands. Mass organizations such as the Ulanhot City Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League Committee, and the Education Union, in order to mobilize citizens to sign, universally established signature stations in various streets and used blackboard newspapers, cartoons, and other forms to publicize the significance of the peace signature campaign.

    Since Inner Mongolia launched the "Week of Opposing American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea" on July 23rd, the people's enthusiasm for opposing wars of aggression has become even more fervent. They unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement, denounced the shameless crimes of American imperialism in invading Taiwan and Korea, and fully devoted themselves to the anti-American aggression movement. The Inner Mongolia agencies stationed in Zhangjiakou and the Inner Mongolia Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have successively held current affairs symposiums. People in Tongliao County, Zhaowuda League, Ulanhot, Manzhouli, Haiyiergen E'erge, Beizi Temple, Hailar, Zhalantun, Kailu, Zhengxiang White Banner, and other places have held parades or mass rallies. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to strive to support the liberation of Taiwan and support the just war of the Korean people, resolutely oppose American imperialism and its vassal states from disrupting world peace, and the number of people participating in the signature campaign has therefore increased more and more. For example, two-thirds of the citizens in Lubei Street, Zhalute Banner, signed their names to oppose American imperialist aggression. The combination of the peace signature campaign and the anti-American aggression movement has made the momentum even greater.

    In the areas where the peace signature campaign has been carried out, the people's awareness has generally increased due to in-depth current affairs publicity. They not only signed their names but also actively expressed their attitude, wanting to use practical actions to strengthen the forces defending world peace. Cavalry comrades unanimously vowed: to always be staunch fighters defending world peace. They unanimously expressed their determination to strengthen cultural studies and complete production and training tasks. Soldiers from the Zhemeng Public Security Team participating in dike repairs each carried one cubic meter more of soil per day than before. Worker comrades actively participated in the signature campaign and led other masses with their exemplary actions. Employees of the Electric Power Bureau also expressed their determination to strengthen their work and ensure uninterrupted power supply. The determination of farmers and herdsmen to defend world peace is also very strong. After signing their names, farmers in Du'an Village, Du'erji District, Tuquan County, organized 360 people and established an armed self-defense team to prevent various sabotage activities by enemies of peace. The folks in Balagartai Nutuk, Horqin Right Front Banner, unanimously expressed their determination to work hard in production, grow more grain, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

    Based on the above situation, the people of Inner Mongolia have received a good education and gained a lot through the peace signature campaign. In order to enable all the people of Inner Mongolia to express their will and strength to defend world peace, this campaign will continue to be carried out in the future, striving to have everyone who is willing to sign, sign their name on the peace declaration.

　　广泛宣传、全力发动、逐步推展
    内蒙和平签名人数达四十余万
    工农兵一致表示要以实际行动来保卫世界和平
    【本报讯】据内蒙古日报消息：内蒙古的和平签名运动于五月十八日正式展开，八十天来，经过各级党、政领导机关与群众团体的全力发动，广泛进行宣传，截至目前为止，根据不完全的统计，参加签名的已达四十三万二千零六人，超过内蒙古现有总人口六分之一。其中以兴安盟的签名人数最多，计有二十一万七千余人，占内蒙总签名人数的百分之五十强；兴安盟中又以突泉一县的签名人数居首位，计为八万六千六百五十六名，达到全县总人口的百分之六十三。
    在整个运动进行当中，各地党、政领导机关与群众团体密切配合，拟定了开展这一运动的具体步骤。一般首先在干部人员中进行时事学习，然后组织力量深入群众展开宣传；先在城市发动，然后逐步扩展到农村或草地。乌兰浩特市总工会、青年团委、教联等群众团体，为了发动市民群众签名，在各街普遍建立了签名站，并以黑板报、漫画等形式进行宣传和平签名运动的意义。
    自七月二十三日内蒙展开“反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜运动周”后，各地人民反对侵略战争的情绪更是热烈，一致拥护周外长的严正声明，痛斥美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜的无耻罪行，全力地投入了反美侵略运动。内蒙古驻张家口各机关、内蒙古中苏友好协会均先后举行时事座谈会。通辽县、昭乌达盟、乌兰浩特、满洲里、海伊尔根额尔格、贝子庙、海拉尔、扎兰屯、开鲁、正厢白旗等地人民均举行了游行示威或群众集会，大家一致表示决为支援解放台湾、声援朝鲜人民的正义战争而奋斗，坚决反对美帝及其仆从国家破坏世界和平，参加签名的人因此愈益加多。如扎鲁特旗鲁北街三分之二的市民都为了反对美帝侵略而签了名。和平签名运动与反美侵略运动相结合，声势乃更浩大。
    在和平签名运动开展的地区，经过深入的时事宣传，人民的觉悟普遍提高。他们不但签名，并积极地表示了自己的态度，要拿实际行动来加强保卫世界和平的力量。骑兵同志们异口同声地发誓：永远要做保卫世界和平的坚强战士。一致表示加强文化学习，完成生产与练兵任务，哲盟公安队参加修堤的战士们，每人每日都比从前多挑了一立方米土。工人同志们积极参加签名，并以自己的模范行动，带动了其他群众。电业局的职工们并表示决心加强工作，保证不停电。农民们和牧民们保卫世界和平的决心亦是非常坚强。突泉县杜尔基区杜安村的农民们签完名后，为了防止和平敌人的各种破坏活动，组织了三百六十人，成立了武装自卫队。科右前旗巴拉格歹努图克的老乡们一致表示努力生产，多打粮食，支援人民解放军解放台湾。
    根据以上的情况，内蒙人民通过和平签名运动，大都受了一次很好的教育，有了不少的收获。为使全体内蒙人民都能表示自己保卫世界和平的意志与力量，今后这一运动将继续开展下去，争取每个愿意签名的人，都在和平宣言上签上自己的名字。
