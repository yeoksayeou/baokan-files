(Shanghai News) Under the strong support of the government, Shanghai's private cotton textile industry has gradually recovered since May and has recently begun to improve. According to statistics, in June and July, 90% of the 38 operating yarn mills received cotton allocation for processing, and processing cotton yarn accounted for half of the total production in each of those months. The actual number of spindles operating also accounted for 71% of the possible number of spindles that could be operating in each month, and the number of shifts per week increased from 7 in June to 8 in July. According to the processing plan for August, 27,107 bales of yarn will be processed, an increase of 10.7% compared to the previous month, which will account for 72% of the total production in the same month, showing a steady trend of advancement in production. While only individual factories such as Hongfeng and Dafeng reached the break-even point in May, most factories such as Zhongfang, Datong, and Shenyi have recently approached the break-even point, some factories such as Rende and Rongfeng have reached the break-even point, and some factories such as Hongfeng and Zhaofeng have slightly profited. Of course, continuing to strive for improvement and break-even production remains an important issue for all factories at present.

The main reasons for the improvement are that, in addition to the government expanding the processing plan and adjusting the labor cost standards successively, during the period of rising market cotton prices from May 2 to June 15, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation successively listed and sold 29,047.49 dan of cotton; state-owned yarn mills also simultaneously gave up the cotton they were entitled to, allocating all the cotton stored in the Cotton Joint Purchasing Office and the cotton it continued to purchase to private factories, so that the factories would not be affected by the lack of raw materials and increased costs. At the same time, in order to cooperate with the government to stabilize cotton prices and take care of self-spinning factories, the Yarn Mill Association implemented planned cotton purchasing from June 15, and factories no longer purchased on their own. This ensured the stability of cotton prices.

In addition, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation has repeatedly taken the initiative to increase the listed price of cotton yarn in order to normalize the price ratio of cotton yarn and cloth. For example, on June 26, the price of each bale of yarn was increased by 150,000 yuan, and on July 24, it was increased by another 200,000 yuan; the cotton conversion rate for each bale of 20-count yarn also increased from more than 500 jin in mid-June to more than 600 jin at present.

Another reason for the improvement is the production and conservation efforts of the workers. The trade unions in most factories are production-oriented, uniting with the capitalists, and signing labor contracts to try to reduce the electricity consumption and cotton consumption per bale of yarn and improve production efficiency as much as possible. Some individual factories have also launched production competitions. According to statistics, the average yarn production per spindle per 20 hours in operating factories reached 0.813 pounds in June; it decreased slightly in July due to climate reasons, but still maintained 0.804 pounds. This has played a significant role in reducing costs. However, some factory trade unions do not pay enough attention to production, and some workers do not consider the long-term interests of the working class, are not enthusiastic about their work, and have lower output. For example, the average output of the Yong'an factories in July was only 0.7 pounds, falling below the general level (it is said that this is because senior staff in the factory take secret subsidies and receive two salaries, which also affects the production enthusiasm of ordinary workers). In particular, Yong'an No. 3 Factory has now become the yarn factory with the lowest output. In addition, some workers in individual factories do not understand the significance of production for increasing the country's wealth, and are very serious and responsible for the processing and weaving entrusted by the government; however, they are more careless in their work for the factory's own spinning and weaving, and there are more defective products. These deviations still need to be corrected.

Another reason for the further improvement in production is that, after production has become more stable, the confidence of the general capitalists has increased, and they have begun to transform their enterprises themselves. For example, the six factories of the Shenxin system established a general management office on May 8, so that nearly 400,000 spindles have been transformed from decentralized management to centralized management, and have initially formulated operating standards and simplified the types of finished products, reducing production costs. After repeated labor-capital consultations, Defeng Yarn Factory appropriately streamlined its organization, greatly reducing waste. Zhongfang No. 1 and No. 2 Factories, and Dazhong No. 1 and No. 2 Factories are all brewing mergers to reduce costs.

Rongfeng Yarn Factory, one of the factories with more serious difficulties, has been able to brave reforms. In the streamlining, it dismissed five senior staff such as managers and deputy managers and chief and deputy auditors, and ten "consultants" who were paid without working. With the support of the workers, it finally saved the crisis and has achieved break-even. Huayang Yarn Factory shipped 500 bales of foreign cotton back from Hong Kong in late May. Datong Yarn Factory decided to transfer 150,000 Hong Kong dollars from Hong Kong as capital for break-even production. This shows that many private yarn factories are striving for self-reliance, which is very good, but in general, some capitalists still have the idea of long-term dependence on the government, unilaterally demanding to increase labor costs, but neglecting their own transformation. Some factories are also afraid of "trouble" and lack the habit of careful calculation, thinking that streamlining and economizing are "small things" and cannot solve the problem. Therefore, progress is slower and there is still a considerable distance from break-even, Yong'an Yarn Factory being an example. Some capitalists attach importance to transforming the organization, but always want to make calculations on the workers, and rarely think of their own methods. For example, the capitalists of Zhongfang Yarn Factory proposed to streamline 303 workers after the merger of the two factories. However, after the labor side conducted an investigation based on the workshops, it proved to be unreasonable. The second revision was to streamline 115 workers. After the labor side based on the actual needs of each workshop and thought of ways to open more looms, as a result, no one needed to be streamlined.

Recently, due to the gradual normalization of the price ratio of cotton yarn and cloth, private factories have a trend of reducing processing and increasing self-spinning, which is a very good phenomenon. However, some factories see that self-spinning is profitable, but they do not try to solve the raw material problem outside the plan, only hoping that the government will sell the imported cotton that has been losing money at market prices, which violates the policy of taking both public and private interests into account. Secondly, Shenxin Yarn Factory, which had been shut down for a long time, resumed work without contacting relevant institutions such as the Industry and Commerce Bureau in advance, and without a detailed production plan. These should all be corrected.

### 政府扶植下争取进一步好转  上海棉纺业稳步前进  有些资方仍有依赖思想应克服

　　政府扶植下争取进一步好转
    上海棉纺业稳步前进
    有些资方仍有依赖思想应克服
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：沪市私营棉纺业，在政府大力扶植下，五月份起逐步复苏，最近已开始好转。据统计：六、七两月份三十八家开工纱厂百分之九十获得配棉代纺，代纺棉纱均占各该月份生产总量的一半。实开锭数亦均占各该月份可能开工锭数百分之七十一，每周开工班数则由六月份的七班增加到七月份的八班。根据八月份的加工计划，代纺纱为二万七千一百零七件，较上月增加百分之十点七，将占同月份生产总量百分之七十二，生产上表现出稳步前进的趋势。如五月份仅有鸿丰及大丰等个别厂家达到保本，而最近大部厂家如中纺、大同、申一等亦已接近保本，部分厂家如仁德、荣丰等厂达到保本，若干厂家如鸿丰、兆丰等则已稍有盈余。当然，继续争取好转和保本生产，仍为各厂当前的重要课题。
    好转的主要原因，除政府扩大加工计划，先后调整工缴标准外，且在五月二日到六月十五日市场棉价上涨期间，花纱布公司先后挂牌出售棉花二万九千零四十七点四九担；公营纱厂亦同时放弃应得配棉，将棉花联购处全部存棉及继续收购的棉花，悉数配给私营各厂，使各厂不致因原料缺乏和成本增高而影响生产。同时，纱厂同业公会为配合政府稳定棉价，照顾自纺各厂，从六月十五日起实行有计划的购棉，各厂不再自行采购。这样，就保证了棉价的稳定。
    此外，花纱布公司将使花纱价格比例趋于正常，曾多次主动提高棉纱牌价。如在六月二十六日每件纱提高十五万元，七月二十四日又提高二十万元；每件二十支纱的换棉率亦由六月中间的五百余斤增至目前的六百余斤。
    另一个促成好转的原因，是职工们的生产节约。大部工厂的工会均面向生产，团结资方，并订立劳动公约，尽量争取减低每件纱的用电量及用棉量，并提高生产效率。有个别的厂并展开了生产竞赛。据统计：开工厂家六月份每枚纱锭二十小时平均产纱量已达○·八一三磅；七月份由于气候关系，稍形降低，但仍维持○·八○四磅。这对于减低成本，起了很大作用。但也有若干厂工会不够重视生产，有些职工没有从工人阶级的长远利益打算，工作不起劲，产量较低。如永安各厂七月份平均出数仅○·七磅，落在一般水平之下（据说由于该厂高级职员拿暗贴，领两份薪水，也影响一般职工的生产情绪）。尤其是永安三厂，现已成为纱厂中出数最低的一家。还有个别厂家的部分职工，不明了生产是为国家增加财富的意义，对政府委托的代纺代织，工作很认真负责；但对本厂的自纺自织，工作就比较马虎，次货也比较多。这些偏向还待努力纠正。
    再一个促成生产进一步好转的原因，是生产转趋稳定后，一般资本家的信心提高，开始改造了企业本身。如申新系统六个厂于五月八日成立总管理处，使近四十万枚纱锭由分散经营转为集中经营后，已初步拟订了经营标准及简化成品种类，减低了生产成本。德丰纱厂经多次劳资协商，适当精简机构，大大减少了浪费。其他中纺一、二厂，大中一、二两厂皆在酝酿合并机构，以降低成本。
    又困难较严重的工厂之一的荣丰纱厂，由于资方勇于改造，在精简中，裁汰经副理及总副稽核等高级职员五人，及拿干薪的“顾问”十人，终于在职工的支持下，挽救了危机，且已做到保本。华阳纱厂在五月下旬由香港运回外棉五百包。大同纱厂决由香港调回十五万港币作为保本生产的资金。这说明已有不少私人纱厂都在争取自力更生，是很好的，但一般地说，还有些资本家存在着长期依赖政府的思想，片面要求提高工缴，却忽略了自身的改造。也有的厂家怕“麻烦”，缺乏精打细算的习惯，认为精简节约是“小事情”，不能解决问题。因此，进步较慢，距保本尚有相当距离，永安纱厂就是一例。还有些资本家重视改造机构，但总想在工人头上打算盘，很少自己想办法。如中纺纱厂资方提出在两厂合并后，要精简工人三百零三人。但经劳方根据各车间的调查，证明它是不合理的。第二次就修改成为精简工人一百一十五人。后再经劳方根据各车间实际需要，并想办法多开布机，结果一个人都用不着精简。
    最近，由于花纱比价渐趋正常，私营厂家已有减少代纺、增加自纺的趋势，这是很好的现象。但有些厂家见到自纺有利，自己却又不在计划以外去设法解决原料问题，仅希望政府把赔本运进的外棉以市价出售，这是违反公私兼顾政策的。其次，是停工已久的申新纱厂，事先未与工商局等有关机构联系，也没有周详的生产计划，擅自复工。这些都应注意改正的。
