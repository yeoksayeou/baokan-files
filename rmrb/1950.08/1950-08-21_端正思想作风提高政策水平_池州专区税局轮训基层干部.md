　　Correct Ideological Style, Improve Policy Level
    Chizhou Special District Tax Bureau Rotates Training for Grassroots Cadres
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to correct the ideological style of grassroots cadres and improve their policy and professional level, the Chizhou Special District Tax Bureau in southern Anhui Province held cadre rotation training in phases. The second training class ended on July 27. The trainees have improved ideologically, but the self-criticism and examination were not thorough enough and will continue on their work posts.

    Most of the grassroots cadres in the special district are newly recruited or retained personnel. There are many problems in both their work and ideological styles. According to the statistics of 41 cadres participating in the second training session, 20 of them engaged in corruption, embezzlement of public funds, bribery, and illicit relationships, accounting for nearly half. In addition, 11 people showed signs of being uneasy about tax work and being careless in their work style. In particular, some new cadres have weak working abilities, are unwilling to learn, are unfamiliar with policies and business, and have an improper style. In their work, they either do nothing all day long or use coercion and abuse to "complete tasks." This illustrates the seriousness of the chaotic state of mind of these cadres and the importance of collective training for rectification.

    After the rectification training from July 6 to 27, the cadres studied the important reports of the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC and the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and after 12 days of ideological examination, political lessons, and democratic appraisal, the chaotic thoughts of the cadres have been initially clarified, allowing many cadres with bad work styles, corruption, and moral degradation to receive strict mass criticism in their ideological examination and begin to realize their mistakes. At the same time, the examination also revealed that some county leaders were negligent and did not pay attention to the education of cadres, condoning the development of some cadres' shortcomings. For example, among the five cadres transferred from Zhide County, three had serious corruption behaviors, for which the county leadership should bear the main responsibility. In addition, the leaders of the Qingyang County Tax Bureau generally kept a close watch on the cadres, but there were deviations in the use of cadres. They relied only on one-sided understanding, thinking that if one aspect was good, everything was good. Once a problem was discovered, they would negate everything and distrust them, instead of seizing the opportunity to strengthen education and help cadres improve. This should be paid attention to. In addition, the study also revealed that individual cadres had a poor understanding of current affairs and an insufficient understanding of the growing strength of the world's democratic camp. This reflects that some counties do not pay enough attention to political education for cadres during ordinary times, and the leaders of each county should be vigilant in a timely manner.

    In general, through this rectification training, the political and ideological level of the trainees has been universally improved, and many problems have been exposed. However, the shortcoming is that the examination combined with work is not thorough enough. Therefore, the leaders of the special district tax bureau require that after returning to their work posts, cadres from various counties should continue to actively participate in rectification and continue to conduct in-depth examinations in conjunction with their work.

### 端正思想作风提高政策水平  池州专区税局轮训基层干部

　　端正思想作风提高政策水平
    池州专区税局轮训基层干部
    【本报讯】皖南池州专区税务局，为端正基层干部的思想作风，提高其政策、业务水平，曾分期举行干部轮训，第二期训练班已于七月二十七日结束，受训干部思想上已有提高，惟检查尚不够深入，将在工作岗位上，继续进行整风。
    该专区基层干部大部为新参加工作者及留用人员，不论在工作与思想作风方面均存在不少问题，据第二期参加受训的四十一个干部情况统计，有贪污、挪用公款、受贿、搞男女关系等行为者即有二十人之多，几占半数。另外在思想上表现不安心税务工作，工作作风马马虎虎者十一人。特别是有些新干部，工作能力弱，又不愿学习，政策业务不熟悉，且作风不正派，在工作中不是饱食终日无所用心，就是用强迫命令打人骂人来“完成任务”。这说明了这批干部思想作风中所存在的混乱状况的严重。也说明了集训整风的重要。
    经过七月六日到二十七日的整训，学习了中共三中全会及人民政协第二次全国委员会的各项重要报告，并经过十二天的思想检查，上政治课及民主鉴定后，干部的混乱思想已初步得到澄清，使许多作风恶劣、贪污腐化的干部，在思想检查中受到群众性的严格批评，开始认识了自己的错误。同时在检查中还发现有的县领导上麻痹大意，不重视对干部的教育，纵容了一些干部的缺点的发展。如至德县调训的五个干部中间，即有三个有严重贪污行为，这是该县领导上应负主要责任的。另外青阳县税务局领导上，对干部一般的说是抓得较紧的，但在使用干部上却有偏差，只凭片面的了解，一好即认为什么都好，一旦发现毛病，即否定一切不予信任，而不是适时地抓紧教育，帮助干部提高，这是应该引起注意的。另外，在学习中还发现个别干部对时事认识太差，对世界民主阵营的日益强大认识不足。这反映出有些县平时对干部的进事政治教育重视不够，各县领导上应该及时引起警惕。
    总的说来，通过这次整训，已使受训干部政治思想普遍提高一步，并暴露了不少问题。但缺点是结合工作检查还不够，也不够深入。因此，专区税局领导上，要求各县干部回到工作岗位后，仍要积极参加整风，结合工作继续进行深入检查。
