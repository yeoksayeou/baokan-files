　　Yushe Dazhai Village CPC Branch
　　Reports Production Increase Methods to Chairman Mao

Editor's Note: The CPC Dazhai Village Branch in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, is a model branch that unites all villagers to develop production. The branch secretary is Comrade Zhang Changfu, and the branch has a total of thirty-four members. Because the branch has paid attention to improving Party organizational life, strengthening branch education, and receiving direct assistance from county and district leaders, the branch has truly united all villagers in developing rural production, and the lives of all villagers have gradually become prosperous. Last year, the whole village increased production by 20% compared to the average of 1947 and 1948. Among them, although the male labor force in Dazhai Natural Village decreased by 28% compared to before the war, grain income exceeded the pre-war level. The village includes four natural villages. This year's production development methods focus on promoting improved varieties and improving soil quality, guaranteeing an increase of 1.5 dou per mu. The village and Xigou Village in Ping Shun County were simultaneously commended by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government on June 24 this year.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] After the CPC Dazhai Village Branch in Yushe, Shanxi Province, was commended by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government for its production achievements, it is working harder to ensure an increase of 1.5 dou per mu this year. It also wrote to Chairman Mao, reporting on the situation of improving farming techniques and developing production in the past six months. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:

Under your leadership, our branch implemented land reform, and peasants with no or little land were allocated land. Everyone is actively engaged in production on their own land; and according to your instructions, they are organizing, improving technology, and overcoming various disasters. On the basis of a 12% increase in production in the entire administrative village last year, we are cooperating with the government to lead the masses to gradually realize the plan to increase production by 1.5 dou per mu this year. In production, we have seized the important link of organizing and improving technology, and have now made great achievements. First, Comrade Zhang Zhiquan, as the head, took the lead in promoting improved varieties on 654 mu. Comrade Zhiquan also took out his own 1.2 mu of land to experiment with 16 kinds of grain seeds and 12 kinds of miscellaneous seeds. He also agreed with four households to be directly led by Comrade Zhiquan to promote and improve farming techniques. We plan to promote all improved seeds within three years. Second, geological soil improvement has been carried out. We plan to pad the river beach clay with sand and the slope sandy land with white soil. This spring, 564 mu of soil has been improved. After observation during weeding, we saw that the seedlings in the improved soil were obviously different from those in the unimproved soil: in the improved soil, the seedlings were neat, lush, and prosperous. Therefore, we have formulated a plan to improve all the soil within four years. Third, the entire administrative village has achieved fertilization and planting according to local conditions. And 1,950 mu of crops have completed seed soaking and dressing with medicine, accounting for 97.5% of the total land. This has laid the foundation for increasing production by 1.5 dou per mu. In the past six months, based on Dazhai Natural Village as a base, three mass education campaigns and two mass door-to-door inspections have been carried out by means of on-site observation and symposiums, overcoming the previous phenomenon of unbalanced production. In order to fully overcome natural disasters, we have established a seedling protection committee to specialize in the technology of preventing and controlling disasters. We are determined to lead the masses to increase production year by year under your leadership, so that the lives of the masses will become increasingly prosperous.

We wish you and all leading comrades of the Party Central Committee good health!

The entire members of the CPC Yusha Dazhai Branch

　　榆社大寨村中共支部
    向毛主席报告增产办法
    编者按：中共大寨村支部，是山西省榆社县团结全村农民发展生产的模范支部。支部书记是张昌福同志，支部党员共三十四人。由于支部注意了健全党内组织生活，加强支部教育，并得到县区领导的直接帮助，使支部真正作到了团结全村农民，发展农村生产，全村农民生活因之逐渐走向富裕。去年全村较一九四七、一九四八两年平均增产二成。其中大寨自然村男劳力虽然比战前减少百分之二十八，但粮食的收入却超过了战前水平。该村包括四个自然村。今年发展生产的办法着重推广优良品种和改良土质，保证增产一斗五升。该村和平顺的西沟村在今年六月二十四日同时受到了山西省人民政府的通令嘉奖。
    【本报讯】山西榆社大寨村中共支部全体党员，在山西省人民政府通令嘉奖该村生产成绩后，为保证今年增产一斗五升而更加奋发前进。并上书毛主席，报告半年来改进耕作技术，发展生产的情形。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们支部在您的领导下实行了土地改革，无地和少地的农民都分得了土地。大家都在自己的土地上积极进行生产；并按照您的嘱咐组织起来，改良技术，战胜了各种灾害。在去年全行政村增产一成二的基础上，我们正在协同政府领导群众逐步实现今年每亩增产一斗五升的计划。在生产中我们抓住组织起来改良技术这一重要环节，现在已做出很大成绩。首先以党员张志全同志为首带头推广优良品种六百五十四亩。志全同志并拿出自己一亩二分地实验了十六种谷种与十二种杂田种。并约定四户由志全同志直接领导进行推广与改进耕作技术。我们准备在三年内全部推广优良种籽。其次，进行了改良地质土壤。我们计划要把河滩胶泥地垫砂，坡地砂地垫白土。今春已经改良土壤五百六十四亩。我们经过在锄苗中的观摩，看到改良土壤后的小苗和未改良土壤的小苗显然不同：改良土壤的地里，小苗齐垄繁茂。因此，我们又拟定了四年内改良全部土壤的计划。第三，全行政村作到了因地施肥与因地下种。并有一千九百五十亩作物完成了浸种与药剂拌种，占总土地数百分之九十七点五。这给每亩地增产一斗五升打下了基础。半年来，依据大寨自然村为基点，采用实地观摩与座谈会的方式，开展了三次群众性的教育，两次群众性的登门访户检查，克服以往生产不平衡的现象。为了全力战胜天灾，我们成立了保苗委员会，专门研究防治灾害的技术。我们决心在您的领导下带领群众年年增产，使群众生活日益富裕。
    祝您和党中央各领导同志身体健康！
        中共榆社大寨支部全体党员
