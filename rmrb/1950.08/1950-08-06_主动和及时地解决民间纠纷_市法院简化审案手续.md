　　Proactively and promptly resolve civil disputes.
    Municipal court simplifies case handling procedures
    [Our newspaper reported] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: In order to better and more promptly resolve civil disputes and give play to the initiative in its work, the Beijing Municipal People's Court has decided to change the previous practice of cases first being centrally submitted to the office of the Adjudication Committee and then distributed to the judges of each court. Instead, it will implement a system where, after the parties arrive at the receiving and dispatching office, that office will directly introduce them to the judges of each court according to the category of the case, and ensure that the judge meets with the parties on the same day. However, that office must submit a report to the Adjudication Committee office every day. This will reduce many unnecessary formalities. At the same time, for some parties who are emotional or do not understand policies and regulations, explanations and persuasion can be given in a timely manner when the judge meets with them, so that they voluntarily withdraw the case. For cases that must be resolved through litigation, a conversation must first be conducted to understand the case and supplement materials, so as to ensure a smooth trial.
    In the past, the People's Court had a large backlog of cases. After the case was received, the judge would not inquire about it for many days or even several months, and some individual cases were delayed for half a year. Therefore, citizens reflected that: "The People's Court is fair, simple, and inexpensive, and one does not get angry in a lawsuit, but the only problem is that it cannot solve problems in a timely manner." In this way, the people cannot obtain many practical benefits, and even some of the people's legitimate rights and interests are damaged as a result, and the illegal behavior of certain people is instead condoned. In response to this situation, the People's Court stipulated a method to ensure that the judge meets with the parties on the same day, which is completely realistic. This is also one of the effective methods to strive for initiative in work. Since its implementation a week ago, citizens have been very satisfied with this working method. However, there are still some parties who do not understand this new working method. They only bring a complaint without bringing evidence, and cannot provide the detailed address of the witness; some parties do not come themselves at all, but entrust someone to bring a complaint, which affects the implementation of this new working method.
    In addition, in order to strictly abide by the time and strengthen the planning in work, the Municipal People's Court has specially designated a person to be responsible for checking whether the staff opens the court for trial at the scheduled time, and whether the parties arrive in court on time, and clearly stipulates on the parties' summons the time of arrival in court in the morning or afternoon. If the party fails to appear in court without a legitimate reason, the People's Court will execute the judgment according to the specific circumstances.

### 主动和及时地解决民间纠纷  市法院简化审案手续

　　主动和及时地解决民间纠纷
    市法院简化审案手续
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：北京市人民法院为了更好地及时解决民间纠纷，发挥工作上的主动性，决定改变以往案件须先集中送审判委员会办公室，再分到各庭审判员手里的作法，实行当事人到收发室后，迳由该室按案件类别，介绍到各庭审判员手里，并保证审判员当天即与当事人见面。但该室每日须向审判委员会办公室提出表报。这样就可以减少许多不必要的麻烦手续，同时对一些感情用事的和不明白政策法令的当事人，在审判员与他见面时，可及时进行解释和说服，使其自愿撤销。对一些必须诉讼方得解决的案件，则须首先进行谈话，了解案情，补充材料，以便正式开庭审判时顺利进行。
    过去，人民法院积案较多，案件收进去了，审判员好些日甚至好几个月还没有问过，个别的案子一压就是半年。因此市民反映说：“人民法院办事公正，简便，打官司不要钱，不受气，只有一样不好，就是不能及时解决问题”。这样人民就得不到很多实惠，甚至有些人民的正当权益反因此遭到损害，也有某些人的不法行为反而被放纵了。针对这一情况，人民法院规定了保证审判员与当事人当天见面的办法，是完全切合实际的。这也是争取工作主动的有效方法之一。实行一周以来，市民对这一工作方法很满意。但也还有一部分当事人尚不明白这一新的工作方法，只带诉状，不带证物，证人的详细住址也说不上来；有的当事人则根本自己不到，托人捎个诉状来，这样就影响了这个新的工作方法的进行。
    此外，市人民法院为严格遵守时间，加强工作上的计划性，特指定专人负责检查工作人员是否按预定时间开庭审判，当事人是否按时到庭，并在当事人的传单上明确规定上午或下午几点几分到庭。当事人如无正当理由而不到庭时，人民法院即根据具体情况执行判决。
