　　Serious Shortcomings Exist in the Medical and Nursing Work of North China People's Hospital; Inspection and Correction Should Be Carried Out.
    Letters of Criticism from Comrades Ding Tuo and Zhang Qicheng
    Letter from Comrade Ding Tuo to the Editor:
    Since the Central People's Government designated the North China People's Hospital to be responsible for treating the diseases of cadres in the Central People's Government system, in just a few months, there have been several cases of cadres and children of our agency whose lives were almost lost due to the irresponsibility of the People's Hospital, erroneous judgment of their conditions, or casual surgery without thorough examination. For example, in March of this year, Wang Ming, a child of our agency, fell ill with a persistent fever. Because our agency's clinic had poor equipment and could not perform a thorough examination, he was sent to the North China People's Hospital for treatment on March 7. The hospital initially suspected typhoid fever, then said it was pulmonary tuberculosis and asked us to buy streptomycin injections. After a consultation, it was determined to be granulocytopenia, caused by sulfonamide poisoning, and it was believed that eight or nine out of ten cases had little hope, but they would try their best to treat it. If the cells recovered, there was still a one or two out of ten chance. So, it was decided to use penicillin, streptomycin, and cardiac stimulants, with more than twenty injections daily starting on the 10th, and later several blood transfusions. However, the condition worsened, and the high fever continued between 39 and 40 degrees Celsius. His parents repeatedly suggested consulting other hospitals for better treatment methods, but they repeatedly emphasized that no hospital would have better methods, that their diagnosis was beyond doubt, and that sulfonamide poisoning was one hundred percent certain. On March 10, we suddenly received a critical condition report from the People's Hospital, diagnosing: "confluent infiltrates in both lungs ② granulocytic cell reduction" and in the treatment course section wrote: "Before admission, S·D·15 watts was taken." We strongly disagreed with this diagnosis because the child only took S·D·3.6 watts in our agency's clinic before admission, far from the toxic dose, and urged them to look for other causes, but Dr. Mi of the hospital rejected this suggestion with an arrogant attitude. Later, the child kept vomiting blood, so they added a few injections of vitamins and hemostatics, with continuous injections day and night. The child's arms and buttocks were covered with needle holes, causing great pain, but the condition did not improve. After repeated requests, Dr. Deng of the Children's Hospital was invited to consult at the People's Hospital on the afternoon of the 23rd. Dr. Deng believed that granulocytopenia was not necessarily caused by sulfonamide poisoning, and that kala-azar and pulmonary tuberculosis could also cause cell reduction. He would only consider sulfonamide poisoning if the latter two were ruled out. The head of our clinic also pointed out that the amount of S·D· taken by the child was far from the toxic dose and that the cause should be sought elsewhere. These doctors' opinions were rejected by the People's Hospital. They very definitely emphasized that "this is a large amount of sulfonamide poisoning," and repeatedly said it was one hundred percent sulfonamide poisoning, with an exceptionally arrogant attitude. What was even more strange was that Wang, the section chief (name unknown) sent by the Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Health to inspect the work of the People's Hospital, not only did not objectively understand the situation, conduct investigations, or listen to the opinions of other doctors with an open mind, but blindly echoed the opinions of the hospital's doctors, even questioning our clinic's director with a questioning tone: "Don't you believe in science? Today, science proves that it is sulfonamide poisoning!" In this situation, we could no longer speak, but for the safety of the child's life, we had to transfer to Peking University Hospital for treatment. Before transferring to Peking University Hospital on the 25th, another injection of penicillin was given, and they also told us: "Go to any other hospital, and immediately continue injecting penicillin. If too much time passes, there will be trouble." After arriving at Peking University Hospital, it was found that there was no disease in the lungs, so penicillin injections were stopped. After a week, the child's eating, sleeping, and spirit gradually recovered, and the high fever decreased, remaining around 38 degrees Celsius. Finally, kala-azar bacteria were found, determining it to be kala-azar. Peking University Hospital immediately prescribed the correct medicine, and the child soon recovered and was discharged from the hospital. We told the People's Hospital about this situation, but they did not think their diagnosis was wrong. Director Mi believed: "When transferred to Peking University Hospital, it was already in the recovery period of sulfonamide poisoning, and it healed on its own without treatment." Today, it can be said that what real science proved was kala-azar, not sulfonamide poisoning as proven by Director Mi of the People's Hospital and Section Chief Wang of the Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Health, etc. Director Mi once said: "There was no effective method for treating the child's sulfonamide poisoning in the past. If the penicillin treatment method is effective, it should be greatly publicized in the newspaper." This is an idea of treating human life as a child's play to satisfy personal glory. Responsible comrades of the Medical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health told us that the diagnosis and treatment of Peking University Hospital were correct and instructed Director Mi to conduct a review, but Director Mi still had resistance and did not make a deep review.

    Another example is that Comrade Wang Defu of our agency was initially diagnosed by our agency's clinic on April 4 as possibly having acute appendicitis and was rushed to the People's Hospital on the morning of the 5th. However, the doctor in the outpatient department of the hospital, in addition to performing a general examination, did not perform a blood test or check the total number of white blood cells, and did not transfer him to the surgery department for examination. Instead, he told the patient: "You have a stomach problem. There are no beds here. If you are very sick, come back tomorrow!" He gave three packets of medicine and sent him back. But at that time, the patient was in poor spirits and his abdominal pain was getting worse. We still thought it was acute appendicitis, so we rushed him to Peking University Hospital. After examination, surgery was performed immediately, and he soon recovered and was discharged. The final diagnosis of Peking University was also acute appendicitis. If we had followed the diagnosis of the People's Hospital, thinking it was a stomach problem and not paying attention, then his life would have been in danger.

    Another example is that Comrade Dan Ming of our agency had been having a fever for the past six months, and later had abdominal pain. He went to the People's Hospital for examination several times in late March. After an examination on March 31, it was said that his white blood cells had increased a lot and it was considered to be acute appendicitis (later, the hospital determined it to be chronic appendicitis). At that time, it was already known that there was a hard mass in his abdomen, but without thorough examination and careful study, it was decided to perform surgery that afternoon (the chief surgeon was Dr. Fu Shaorong, and the assistants were Drs. Liu Zonghua and Tang Zhengming). After the surgery, they saw that the condition was complicated and could not continue the surgery, so they hurriedly called the surgical director, He Yunqiao, to come to the rescue. Director He suspected intestinal tuberculosis but did not take proper measures. After nearly three hours of surgery, the patient was in serious condition and was given penicillin every day. After four days, it was found that pus was flowing from the wound, indicating that a fecal fistula had formed, and he had a high fever, which was very dangerous. Doctors from Peking University Hospital were invited to consult and also suspected intestinal tuberculosis. More than ten days later, the results of the Peking University Hospital's tests confirmed that it was intestinal tuberculosis, so streptomycin was given. More than a month later, the situation improved. The People's Hospital made serious mistakes from beginning to end in handling Comrade Dan Ming's illness. First, they did not conduct a thorough and careful examination, did not study the condition from all aspects to find out the cause of the disease, and easily performed surgery. This was the first mistake (because intestinal tuberculosis cannot be operated on; once the surgery is performed, it cannot be closed). After the surgery, when they saw that the condition was complicated and suspected intestinal tuberculosis, they should not have continued the surgery, but should have left it as it was, sutured the wound, or removed the tuberculous section of the intestine. However, the People's Hospital did not take these measures. Later, Director He admitted to us that there were upper, middle, and lower strategies for Dan Ming's illness, but they took the lower strategy. This was the second serious mistake. Since the People's Hospital had messed up the patient, it should have actively taken all measures to treat him and taken very responsible care of the patient. However, the People's Hospital had no active measures other than injections and wound cleaning. It did not conduct a detailed examination using X-rays like Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and actively tried to treat him. The People's Hospital messed up the patient and did not pay attention to the patient's nursing work. When Comrade Dan Ming had not yet come out of danger, and was too weak to speak, he asked other patients to call the nurse to urinate, but the nurse did not come, so the patient had to struggle to get the bedpan from the stool by the bed and urinate on the bed (we raised objections to this, and there were some improvements later). If the People's Hospital had a sense of responsibility, it should have given special attention to seriously ill patients, always paying attention to the changes in their condition, and actively trying to treat them. If they were not confident, they should have actively sent him to other hospitals for examination or treatment, but the People's Hospital did not do so. When Dan Ming's condition temporarily improved at the People's Hospital, pus was found in his abdominal cavity, and he had severe abdominal pain. When the patient felt that his condition was deteriorating and asked to be transferred to another hospital, the responsible doctor at the hospital initially refused to transfer him, fearing that other hospitals would know that they had messed up the patient and would be scolded. Later, after being persuaded by a veteran cadre of the hospital, they reluctantly agreed. Before Comrade Dan Ming was sent to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for examination, we asked them to send a doctor who was familiar with his condition to go with him to explain the condition clearly. The superiors mobilized Dr. Liu to go, and Dr. Liu agreed, but he didn't go when it was time to leave. According to comrades in the hospital, he was unwilling to go because he was afraid that other hospitals would see that the patient had been messed up like this and would be scolded. For the sake of face, for the sake of avoiding scolding, could they disregard the lives of our cadres?!

    In two or three months, problems have occurred one after another in the treatment of cadres in our agency at the People's Hospital, causing a general fear and dissatisfaction with the People's Hospital among cadres. Therefore, sick people are unwilling to go to the People's Hospital and ask to be treated in other hospitals, making it extremely difficult for our organization to handle patients!

    We believe that the People's Hospital has done work and treated many patients, most of whom have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. Their work has some achievements, which should be affirmed. However, from the perspective of the serious task of the North China People's Hospital being designated to be responsible for treating the diseases of middle- and lower-level cadres in the Central People's Government system, and from the perspective of some serious errors and shortcomings that exist in the hospital's work, the work it has done is difficult to satisfy people. We believe that the fundamental problem existing in the People's Hospital is that a considerable number of staff members have not yet established the concept of serving the people in medical work; a considerable number of staff members quite generally have serious mercenary views, so they are not serious and responsible for medical work, let alone careful and cautious. They adopt a perfunctory attitude towards work, and do not take the initiative to do work; they are pushed to move, and sometimes they do not move even when pushed. The superiors instruct them to wipe the patient's body, they agree to it in person but do not wipe it; some patients have been in the hospital for more than three months and have only had their bodies wiped twice. When a patient asks for a bed sheet, Nurse A says there is none, but when Nurse B is asked to find it, it is found. Even more serious is that, from top to bottom, the People's Hospital generally has a procrastinating style in the treatment of patients or the work of rescuing lives, with slow movements and a very poor sense of time. It often takes several hours from sending a patient to the hospital to being admitted to the ward for treatment, which is very unfavorable for emergency patients. Judging from the examples we have learned about above, we cannot help but suspect whether some staff members of the People's Hospital hold the same view towards the diseases of our cadres as the Kuomintang military hospitals held towards wounded soldiers. We believe that the intolerable attitude taken by the People's Hospital in handling such a serious emergency patient as Comrade Lou Shiyi's son is related to the Kuomintang military hospitals' view towards wounded soldiers. They are very unconcerned and unhurried about rescuing the lives of our comrades and their families, and they seem indifferent to death. Of course, the fact that Comrade Lou Shiyi's child could not be saved is related to the severity of his illness, but his death is also related to the unforgivable attitude taken by the People's Hospital. We believe that the People's Hospital's attitude of not caring, not hurrying, and being indifferent to death towards patients is essentially the Kuomintang military hospitals' view towards wounded soldiers. The existence of this view is a serious threat to our cadres and the people. Therefore, we request the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the People's Supervision Committee to send personnel to thoroughly inspect the work of the People's Hospital, inspect its views on patients, and investigate the causes of its mistakes and where its responsibilities lie.

    We believe that in addition to the serious problems with the People's Hospital's view of patients, which makes it impossible to quickly resolve the errors and shortcomings in the hospital's work, the internal disunity of the hospital is also one of the important factors in not being able to do a good job. Various relationships have not been handled well, and subordinates have great resistance to superiors, and there is disunity between nurses and head nurses, forming small cliques. For example, Wang, the former head nurse of Ward 6, had problems with her ideology and style and could not unite the nurses under her leadership, so the nurses were divided into small cliques. When nurses gave her opinions, she said: "Look at yourself! You still give me opinions!" She once told patients how she worked in the old society, saying that when she was a head nurse, she didn't do any work herself, but only ordered others to do things, and the nurses even had to hold the bedpan for her! ... Now the work is really difficult to do, etc. With such thoughts, of course, she cannot unite cadres to do a good job. There are also problems in the relationship between departments. It is said that there are also some disagreements between the medical department and the nursing department, which affects cooperation in work. Internal disunity cannot enable all staff to work together to do a good job.

    In order to thoroughly and effectively improve the work of the People's Hospital, we put forward the following suggestions:

    (1) The People's Hospital should conduct an inspection from top to bottom and from bottom to top, focusing on inspecting the views and attitudes of all staff members towards patients, launching criticism and self-criticism, and constantly fighting tirelessly against incorrect views. Strengthen political education to make all staff members clearly recognize that the cadres responsible for treatment at the People's Hospital are all middle- and lower-level cadres. They have all shed blood and sweat for the country and the nation on the battlefield, in the KMT-controlled areas, or in the liberated areas, and have fought bravely against the enemy and have made contributions to the country and the nation. Many of them have become seriously ill due to long-term arduous struggles, and the government is very concerned about their diseases and has designated the People's Hospital to be responsible for treatment. Therefore, they should be serious and responsible, careful and cautious, and actively try every means to cure their diseases in treatment, thoroughly correct the past wrong view of not caring about patients, not hurrying, and being indifferent to death, correct the non-materialistic and anti-scientific subjectivism, and eliminate the mercenary view of lacking loyalty to the revolutionary cause. Only by correcting these harmful wrong views can the errors and problems in the work be solved, and can the work be done well. Serious attention should be paid to and the errors and shortcomings in the work should be corrected, because even a slight shortcoming in the work will deepen the patient's suffering, and in severe cases, it will sacrifice the lives of cadres.

    (2) The People's Hospital should organize visits to other hospitals to learn from them, learn their methods of managing hospitals, the experience of medical work and nursing work, and learn their methods of educating cadres. This is useful for improving the work of the People's Hospital.

    (3) The Ministry of Health should appropriately adjust the personnel of the People's Hospital, and transfer a group of capable cadres to strengthen the leadership of the People's Hospital, especially to transfer capable doctors and political workers to strengthen the People's Hospital, in order to solve the problems of medical work and political ideological education in the hospital.

    (4) The People's Hospital should establish or improve various work systems and work disciplines that can improve work efficiency and ensure the smooth completion of work tasks based on the results of the inspection work. Combine ideological transformation with the implementation of discipline!

    (5) Leading cadres of the People's Hospital should improve their leadership methods, be good at using the principle of democratic centralism, unite internally, strengthen political ideological education, and develop their enthusiasm, creativity, and sense of responsibility in order to achieve the purpose of improving and raising the level of work.

    Finally, we hope that all staff members of the People's Hospital will pay attention to and consider the opinions and criticisms of the masses, have a spirit of self-criticism, seriously review their own errors and shortcomings, and not express dissatisfaction with the opinions and criticisms raised by comrades of our agency and Comrade Lou Shiyi, or dare not see patients again because of being criticized. The correct attitude should be to seriously review oneself, expose the errors in the work, study and analyze the causes of the errors, formulate effective methods for correcting the errors and improving the work, and bravely, actively, practically, and steadily implement the methods for improving the work.

    Letter from Comrade Zhang Qicheng to the Editor:
    Recently, I was hospitalized in the North China People's Hospital for eighteen days due to acute appendicitis. My overall impression is that the People's Hospital, at least the surgical part of the hospital (because I had a surgical illness and only know the situation in the surgical department), still seriously has an irresponsible and careless style of work towards the people. Doctors and nurses are not concerned enough or caring enough for patients. I especially think that the nursing work in the hospital is extremely careless. To give a small example: On the morning of the day I was discharged from the hospital (July 5), I saw a bedpan containing a patient's stool in the toilet of the surgical ward. Until more than 3:00 p.m., no one had dealt with the bedpan. Because the toilet is in the same building as the ward and is very close to the corridor where food is distributed, and the People's Hospital ward has many flies, it is very easy to spread germs. I couldn't bear to see it and reported it to a Dr. Liu, who asked the nurses, but they all said they didn't know who did it. I think this is a very serious problem, but the nurses are so numb that the person in charge of the hospital should be held responsible.

    Secondly, I think the food in the hospital is very bad. The hospital charges five jin of millet per person per day for food. Because some patients cannot eat at all, and some patients have very small appetites, the food should be very good when averaged out. However, the hospital only gives patients a small amount of pork and egg soup. Such food is obviously not nutritious enough for patients who are recovering their health.

    Therefore, I hope that the leading comrades of the hospital will conduct a thorough review as soon as possible and strictly inspect the work to overcome the existing shortcomings.
            Zhang Qicheng, International News Bureau

    Editor's Note: The work of the North China People's Hospital has extremely serious shortcomings, which are well known to many cadres in Beijing's agencies. The Ministry of Health has paid attention to this, and the hospital has also conducted a preliminary inspection. We hope that the hospital's review and improvement methods can be published as soon as possible to urge the improvement of the hospital's work.

　　华北人民医院医疗护理工作存在严重缺点应予检查纠正
    丁拓、张企程同志来信批评
    丁拓同志来信编辑同志：
    自中央人民政府指定华北人民医院负责治疗中央人民政府系统的干部疾病以来，在短短的数月中，本社干部及小孩因人民医院工作不负责，病情判断错误或不经周密检查，轻易开刀，以致生命险遭不测者已有数起。例如今年三月二日本社儿童王明患病，发烧不退。本社医务所因设备差，不能进行周密之检查，遂于三月七日送华北人民医院治疗，该院最初怀疑是伤寒，后来说是肺结核，叫我们买连霉素注射。后经会诊结果又确定是颗粒细胞减少症，这是由磺?中毒而起，而且认为这种病十之八九没有多大希望，但尽量设法医治，待其细胞恢复，仍有十之一二的希望。于是决定用盘尼西林、连霉素、强心针，从十日起每日注射二十多次，以后又输血数次。但病况日趋严重，高烧继续在三十九度至四十度之间。其父母曾屡次提出和其他医院研究有无更好的治疗方法，但他们再三向我们强调任何医院也不会有更好的办法，他们的诊断是毫无疑问的，磺?中毒是百分之百的可靠。三月十日我们突然接到人民医院寄来病危报告书，诊断是：合营技肺合像②颗粒性细胞减少症并在治疗经过一项中写：“在入院前曾服Ｓ·Ｄ·十五瓦”。这种诊断，我们很不同意，因为小孩在入院前在本社医务所只服Ｓ·Ｄ·３．６瓦，离中毒量甚远，并促其再从其他方面找原因，但该院米大夫以傲慢的态度拒绝这种意见。后来孩子又不断吐血，于是加了几针维他命和止血针，每日昼夜不断注射，小孩的两臂和臀部针孔密布，痛苦万状，而病况仍无好转之迹象。经过我们屡次要求，才于二十三日下午请儿童医院邓大夫到人民医院会诊。邓大夫认为颗粒细胞减少症并不一定是由磺?中毒而起，黑热病和肺结核也可以引起细胞减少，如果确定不是后二者，他才可以考虑到磺?中毒上。我们医务所负责人又提出小孩所服Ｓ·Ｄ·之数量离中毒量甚远，应从其他方面找原因。这些医生的意见均为人民医院所拒绝。他们十分肯定地强调说：“这是大量磺?中毒”，而且重复地说百分之百的是磺?中毒，态度异常傲慢。更令人奇怪的是卫生部检查局派去人民医院检查工作的王科长（名不详）不仅没有客观地了解情况，进行调查研究，虚心倾听其他医生的意见，反而盲目地附和院方医生意见，甚至带着质问的口气，向我们医务所负责人说：“你难道不相信科学？今天科学证明就是磺?中毒！”在这种情况下，我们无法再说话，但是为了孩子的生命安全，只好转到北大医院治疗。二十五日转到北大医院之前还注射一针盘尼西林，他们还叮咛我们：“到别的任何医院，就立刻继续注射盘尼西林，如隔时过久，要出麻烦。”到北大医院后，经检查肺部并没有病，如是停止注射盘尼西林，经一星期之久，孩子吃饭睡眠走上正轨，精神渐渐恢复，高热下降，保持三十八度上下。最后检查出黑热病的病菌，断定是黑热病，北大医院即对症下药，不久小孩病愈出院。我们将此情况告诉人民医院，但是他们并不认为他们的诊断是错误的。米主任认为：“转到北大医院时，已经到了磺?中毒的恢复期，是不治而自愈的”。今天可以说真正科学所证明的是黑热病，而不是人民医院米主任及卫生部检查局王科长等等的科学所证明的磺?中毒。米主任曾说：“孩子的磺?中毒，过去还没有发明有效办法，如果用盘尼西林的治疗方法获效后，要在报纸上大大地发表一下。”这是以人命为儿戏满足个人风头的思想。卫生部医政处负责同志曾告诉我们，北大医院的诊断治疗是正确的，曾指示米主任进行检讨，但米主任仍有抵抗情绪未作深刻检讨。
    又如本社王德富同志于今年四月四日经本社医务所初诊，判断可能是急性阑尾炎，即于五日上午急送人民医院，但该院门诊部医生除施行一般检查外，没有验血、未检查白血球总数，更未转外科检查，而向病人说：“你是胃病，这里没有床位，你如果病得厉害，明天再来！”便给了三包药打发回来。但是当时病人精神不佳，腹部疼痛加剧，我们仍然认为是急性阑尾炎，便急送北大医院，经检查，立即施行手术，不久即病愈出院。北大最后诊断也是急性阑尾炎。如果按照人民医院的诊断，认为是胃病而不加注意，那末一定要发生生命危险。
    又如本社丹明同志半年来经常发烧，后来腹部疼痛，曾于三月下旬去人民医院检查数次。三月三十一日检查后，据说白血球增加很多，认为是急性阑尾炎（后来该院确定是慢性阑尾炎），当时已知道腹部有一硬块，亦未进行周密检查和仔细研究，即决定当天下午开刀（主刀者为符绍融大夫，助手为刘宗华、汤正明两位大夫）他们开刀之后，看到病情复杂，即无法进行手术，便匆忙打电话找外科主任贺云翘临时上场开刀。贺主任怀疑有肠结核但又未采用妥善办法处置。病人经过将近三小时的手术后，病势沉重，每日打盘尼西林，经过四天，发现伤口流出粪汁，知道已形成粪漏，且发高烧，情况十分危险。便请北大医院医生来会诊，也怀疑有肠结核。十多天以后，北大医院化验结果确定是肠结核，便打连霉素。一个多月以后，情况才见好转。人民医院在处理丹明同志的疾病上，自始至终都犯了严重错误，首先是没有进行周密仔细的检查，没有从各方面研究病情找出患病原因，而轻易进行手术。这是第一个错误（因为肠结核症不能开刀，开了刀便无法收口）。当开刀之后，看到病情复杂，怀疑有肠结核时，不要再继续进行手术，可以原封不动，把伤口缝好，或把结核的一节肠子切除。而人民医院却不采取这些办法。后来贺主任对我们谈话亦承认对丹明的病有上、中、下三策，但却采取了下策。这是犯了第二个严重的错误。人民医院既把病人开坏，就应该积极地采取一切办法治疗，并且很负责地护理病人，但是人民医院除了打针，洗伤口外，亦无积极的办法。没有像北京医院那样用Ｘ光进行详细检查，积极设法进行治疗。人民医院开坏了病人，还不注意病人的护理工作。当丹明同志尚未脱离危险期，因气力不足，说话困难之时，要小便托其他病人代叫护士，护士不来，病人只好勉强去把放在床边凳子上的便盆拿到床上小便（我们对此提过意见，以后有某些改进）。如果人民医院有责任感的话，应该特别关照重病人，时刻注意其病情的变化，积极设法为其治疗。如果自己没有把握，就应主动地送其到其他医院检查或治疗，但人民医院没有这样做。当丹明在人民医院一度好转后，又发现腹腔有脓，腹部剧痛，当病人感到病况转坏而要求转院时，该院负责医生最初不愿其转院，怕别的医院知道他们开坏病人会挨骂，以后经该院老干部说服，才勉强答应。丹明同志送北京医院检查之前，我们要求派一比较熟悉其病情的医生同去，把病情交代清楚。上级动员刘大夫去，刘大夫答应了，但临走时又不去了。据该院同志说，他不愿去也是因为怕其他医院看到把病人开成这样，会挨骂。为了面子，为了避免挨骂，就可以不顾我们干部的生命？！
    二三个月中本社干部在人民医院治疗，接二连三地发生问题，致在干部中普遍地对于人民医院发生了恐惧心理和不满情绪。因此害病的人均不愿去人民医院，要求到其他医院治疗，使本机关在处理病人时感到万分困难！
    我们认为人民医院做了工作，医治了很多病人，其中大部分均已病愈出院，他们的工作有些成绩，这点应该加以肯定。但是从华北人民医院被指定为负责治疗中央人民政府系统的中下级干部的严重任务来说，从该院工作中所存在的一些严重错误和缺点来说，它所做的工作是很难令人满意的。我们认为人民医院所存在着根本的问题就是：该院相当一部分工作人员还没有在医务工作上确立其为人民服务的观点；一部分工作人员相当普遍地存在着严重的雇佣观点，因此对于医疗工作是不认真负责，更谈不上小心谨慎。他们对于工作采取敷衍应付的态度，做工作不主动，推一下动一下，有时推了也不动。上级嘱咐给病人擦身，当面答应而又不擦；有些病人入院三个多月只擦两次身。病人要床单，甲护士说没有，又叫乙护士去找，就找出来了。更严重的就是，人民医院自上到下，对于病人的治疗或抢救生命的工作，普遍存在着拖沓的作风，动作迟缓，时间观念极差，从送病人入院到入病房治疗往往花费数小时，这对于急症病人就非常不利。从上述我们了解的事例来看，不能不使我们怀疑人民医院某些工作人员中对于我们干部的疾病是否存在着国民党伤兵医院对待伤兵的观点。我们认为人民医院在处理楼适夷同志的儿子那样严重的急症病人所采取的那样不可容忍的态度是与国民党伤兵医院对待伤兵的观点有关。他们对于抢救我们同志及其家属的生命是很不关心，很不着急，死了好像无关痛痒。当然楼适夷同志的孩子所以无法挽救是与其疾病之严重性有关，但是他的死与人民医院所采取的不可宽恕的态度亦不无关系。我们认为人民医院对于病人采取这样不关心，不着急，死了无关痛痒的观点，在实质上就是国民党伤兵医院对待伤兵的观点。这种观点的存在，对于我们干部和人民是一种严重的威胁。因此我们要求中央人民政府卫生部和人民监察委员会派员彻底检查人民医院的工作，检查其对待病人的观点，追究其错误的原因及其责任所在。
    我们认为人民医院除了对待病人的观点有严重问题因而使该院工作中的错误与缺点不能得到迅速解决外，该院内部的不团结，也是不能做好工作的重要因素之一。各种关系没有搞好，下面人员对上级有很大的抵抗情绪、护士与护士长之间不团结，形成小集团。例如前任六病房王护士长思想作风有问题，不能团结自己领导下的护士，于是下面分成小集团，护士向他提意见时，他说：“你看你自己怎样？还向我提意见！”他曾向病人说他在旧社会的工作怎样怎样，说他以前当护士长，自己不做工作，光命令别人做事，护士还要给他端尿盆哩！………现在工作实在难做等等。他既有这样的思想，当然不能团结干部做好工作。在部门与部门之间的关系也有问题。据说医务部与护士部之间也有些意见，这就影响到工作上的配合。内部的不团结就不能使全体工作人员齐心合力做好工作。
    为了彻底有效地改进人民医院的工作，我们提出下列建议：
    （一）人民医院应自上而下，自下而上地进行一次检查工作，特别着重检查所有工作人员对于病人的观点和态度，展开批评与自我批评，并且不断地向不正确的观点进行不疲倦的斗争。加强政治教育工作，使所有工作人员明确认识人民医院负责治疗的干部都是中下级干部，他们都是在战场上，在蒋管区或在解放区为国家民族流血流汗，与敌人进行过英勇的斗争，对于国家民族有所贡献的，他们由于长期的艰苦奋斗，许多人身染重病，而政府非常关心他们的疾病，乃指定人民医院负责治疗。因此，他们在治疗上就应该认真负责，小心谨慎，积极主动地想尽一切办法治愈他们的疾病，彻底纠正过去那种对病人不关心，不着急死了无关痛痒的错误观点，纠正那种非唯物的，反科学的主观主义，肃清那种对于革命事业缺乏忠诚的雇佣观点。只有纠正了这些有害的错误观点，才能解决工作中所犯的错误和毛病，也才能将工作做好。应该严重注意和改正工作中的错误和缺点，因为在工作中稍为存在一些缺点，都会加深病人的痛苦，大者就会牺牲干部的生命。
    （二）人民医院应该组织参观，向其他医院学习，学习他们管理医院的方法，医疗工作与护理工作的经验，学习他们教育干部的方法。这对于改进人民医院的工作是有作用的。
    （三）卫生部应适当调整人民医院的人员，抽调一部分得力的干部加强人民医院的领导，特别是抽调得力的医生和政治工作人员加强人民医院，以解决该院的医疗工作和政治思想教育问题。
    （四）人民医院根据检查工作的结果，建立或改善足以提高工作效能，保证顺利完成工作任务的各种工作制度和工作纪律。使思想改造与执行纪律结合起来！
    （五）人民医院领导干部应该改进其领导方法，善于运用民主集中制的原则，团结内部，加强政治思想教育，发扬他们的积极性创造性和工作责任心，以达到改进和提高工作之目的。
    最后我们希望人民医院全体工作人员重视和考虑群众的意见和批评，要有自我批评的精神，认真检讨自己的错误和缺点，不能像某些同志对于本社同志及楼适夷同志所提的意见和批评表示不满，或是因为受到批评，就不敢再见病人。正确的态度应该是认真检讨自己，揭露工作中的错误，研究和分析产生错误的原因，规定出改正错误、和改进工作的有效办法，并勇敢地积极地踏实地实行改进工作的办法。

    张企程同志来信编辑同志：
    最近我因为患急性盲肠炎，在华北人民医院住了十八天。我所得到的总的印象是：人民医院，至少是该院的外科部分（因为我生的是外科的病，只知道外科的情形），还严重地存在着对人民不负责任的粗枝大叶的作风。医生与护士对病人的关心与照料都很不够。我特别觉得该院的护士工作极其马虎。举一个小例：在我出院那天（七月五日）上午，我看见外科病房厕所中有一个盛着病人大便的便桶放着，直到下午三点多钟，那便桶仍没有人处理。因为那厕所就在病房所在的那座房子里，离开分发饭食的走廊很近，而人民医院病房的苍蝇又是很多的，极易传播病菌。我看不过去，报告了一位姓刘的大夫，他去问护士们，都说不知是谁做的。我认为这是一个很严重的问题，而护士们却如此麻木，该院的主管人员是应该负责任的。
    其次，我觉得该院的伙食办得很糟。该院所收的伙食费是每人每日小米五斤。因为有一部分病人根本不能吃，而有一部分病人饭量也很小，这样拉平起来，伙食应该是很不错的。可是该院给病人吃的只是很少一点的猪肉与蛋汤。这样的饭食，对于在恢复健康中的病人，显然是非常不够营养的。
    因此，我希望该院领导同志尽速进行深刻检讨，并严格检查工作，以克服现存的缺点。

    编者按：华北人民医院的工作有极其严重的缺点，是北京许多机关干部所熟知。中央卫生部已对此加以注意，该院亦已进行初步的检查，我们希望该院的检讨与改进办法能早日发表。以督促该院工作之改进。
