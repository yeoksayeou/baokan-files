　　[Xinhua News Agency, 9th] According to a Telecommunications Agency reporter's report from Singapore: The figures released by the Singapore authorities regarding the strategic raw materials exported from Malaya in the first six months of this year prove the benefits the United States has obtained in the colonial war waged by Britain against the people of Malaya. During this period, nearly 27,000 tons of tin and 167,000 tons of rubber were shipped from Malaya to the United States.
