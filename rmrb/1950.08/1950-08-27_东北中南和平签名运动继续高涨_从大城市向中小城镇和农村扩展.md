　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 26th: The Northeast region has already seen over 22,219,500 people sign the Peace Declaration, accounting for 53.2% of the region's total population. The China Peace Committee and the Shenyang branch recently held an enlarged meeting of the committee to initially summarize the achievements of the signature campaign in the Northeast region over the past three months. The meeting decided to strive for 25 to 30 million signatures in the region by the end of September. The meeting requested all localities to vigorously launch the peace signature campaign in small and medium-sized towns and vast rural areas, in conjunction with flood prevention and preparations for the autumn harvest. Each city and county is required to achieve signatures from three-quarters to four-fifths or more of the total population. Liaodong Province and Heilongjiang Province have both notified all localities to continue to expand the peace signature campaign. Liaodong Province has decided to collect signatures from more than 75% of the province's population by early September. The signature campaign in Heilongjiang Province originally ended at the end of July, but it has now been decided to extend it to mid-September. Harbin City has decided to strive to mobilize another 100,000 to 150,000 people in the city to sign during the period from August 18th to September 20th. Shenyang City has also decided to strive to have more than 90% of the city's population sign. In response to the call for women to account for one-third of the total number of signatures nationwide, the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation has notified the women's federations of all provinces and cities to use the method of convening women's representative conferences to deepen the peace signature campaign into the women's masses in small and medium-sized towns and vast rural areas. The Shenyang Women's Federation has decided to send cadres to village in the city's suburbs to convene women's representative conferences and mobilize 300,000 unorganized women in the suburbs to participate in the signature campaign.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 25th: The peace signature campaigns in Henan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces in the Central-South region have expanded from cities to vast rural areas, with male and female farmers signing the Peace Declaration one after another.

　　As of now, the number of peace signatures in Henan Province has reached 4,035,835, accounting for 12.6% of the province's population. According to incomplete statistics from 63 counties in seven special districts, including Huangchuan, Chenliu, and Huaiyang, the number of farmers who have signed has reached 2,179,515. Farmers in Yanliuzhuang, Wuyang County, signed after collectively swearing an oath in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. They said: "We turned over and were liberated following Chairman Mao, and now we must follow Chairman Mao to defend world peace and live a peaceful life forever." In conjunction with the peace signature campaign, the Henan Military Region conducted patriotic education, and 34,488 commanders and soldiers have signed the Peace Declaration.

　　The number of peace signatures in Guangdong Province (excluding Hainan Administrative Region) has reached 2.4 million. Among them, Guangzhou City has 795,000 signatures, accounting for more than 56% of the city's population of 1.4 million. The number of signatures in Shantou City has also exceeded half of the city's total population. The peace signature campaign in Guangzhou has become an organized, mass-based publicity and education activity. Mass meetings, recreational evenings, speeches, and symposiums have been held in various districts for extensive publicity. The province's signature campaign is gradually expanding from cities to rural areas.

　　According to incomplete statistics at the end of July, the number of peace signatures in Guangxi Province was 1,211,452. Among them, 93,014 people in Wuzhou City signed, accounting for more than 90% of the city's population. The number of signatures in Nanning, Guilin, and Liuzhou cities accounted for about 50% of the city's population. The Guilin-Guibei Daily received more than 70,000 signature books and letters expressing firm determination to defend peace in the first half of July. Many of them were farmers' signatures, who, according to rural customs, pressed their fingerprints on the signature books and sealed them with red paper. The preparatory office of the Guangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and other people's organizations recently called on the people of the province to respond to the call of the China Peace Committee and to continue to carry out the peace signature campaign extensively and deeply in county towns, market towns, and rural areas.
