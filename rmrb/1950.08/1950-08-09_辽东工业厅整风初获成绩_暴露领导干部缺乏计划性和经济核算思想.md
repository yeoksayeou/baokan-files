[Liaodong Dispatch] The Liaodong Provincial Industrial Department began its rectification movement on July 10th, with the participation of department heads (mine managers) from fifteen factories and mines, section and unit chiefs from various business departments, and directors of supply and marketing departments. The focus of the rectification is to summarize the work of the past six months, examine the Industrial Department's management policy, economic accounting system, cost management, production, supply and marketing work, and leadership style. Preliminary inspection results have revealed a lack of thorough planning and economic accounting thinking among the Industrial Department's leadership. For example, in the production of monosodium glutamate (MSG) at the distillery, the main raw material—hydrochloric acid—increased from 20 million yuan per ton to 75 million yuan, increasing the cost by 2.6 times. The produced MSG could not be sold, yet the Industrial Department continued to produce it in large quantities. Currently, 4,661 kilograms are stockpiled, worth 20.1 billion yuan. According to statistics from May, state-owned enterprises, fifteen factories and mines in total, had a total inventory of 255.7 billion yuan. In the supply of raw materials, a lack of planning was also evident. Many materials that were currently needed were not purchased, while many materials that were not needed were purchased in large quantities. Currently, the stockpiled raw materials such as gunpowder, detonators, fuses, pit props, and logs alone are worth over 100 billion yuan.

In addition, the Industrial Department also exhibits a commandist and bureaucratic leadership style, failing to better listen to the opinions of factories and mines, and failing to consider the actual difficulties on the ground. Therefore, the demands made on the lower levels are sometimes impractical. What is even more worth mentioning is that each factory and mine has a large basic construction task this year, but the department has not established an organization to strengthen leadership, resulting in serious waste in the construction work of many factories and mines. The rectification work has now entered the summary and analysis phase. In the future, the focus will be on the problems identified, to find the causes and propose improvement measures.

　　辽东工业厅整风初获成绩
    暴露领导干部缺乏计划性和经济核算思想
    【辽东讯】辽东省工业厅从七月十日即已开始整风，参加者有十五个厂矿的厅长（矿长）、各业务部门科、股长及供销处主任等以上干部。整风重点是总结半年来的工作，检查工业厅的经营方针、经济核算制、成本管理，与生产、供销工作，及领导作风。初步检查结果，已暴露了工业厅的领导缺乏周密计划性和经济核算思想。如酿造厂味素生产，主要原料——盐酸，每吨由两千万元提高到七千五百万元，成本较前提高二·六倍，出的味素又推销不出去，但工业厅仍使之大量生产，现在已积压四千六百六十一公斤，合二百零一亿元。据五月份统计，省营企业十五个厂、矿，共积压产品达两千五百五十七亿元。在原材料的供应上，也表现了无计划，许多当前需要的材料没有买，用不着的材料却买了很多，目前仅积压的材料火药、雷管、导火线、坑木、原木等原材料，价值一千多亿元。
    另外，工业厅还存在强迫命令和事务主义的领导作风，没有更好的听取厂、矿的意见，也没有更多考虑下边的实际困难，因此对下边要求，有时就不切合实际。更值得提出的是：各厂、矿今年有庞大的基本建设任务，但厅里却没有建立机构来加强领导，致许多厂、矿在修建工作上，存在着严重的浪费现象。目前整风工作已进入总结与分析阶段，今后将以检查出来的问题为重心，找出产生原因和改进办法。
