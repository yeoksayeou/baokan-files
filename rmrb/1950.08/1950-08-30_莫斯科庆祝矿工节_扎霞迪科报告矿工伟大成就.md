Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th. TASS Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Miner's Day celebration was held on the 26th at the Moscow Trade Union Building. Engineers, technicians, miners, and staff attended the meeting and were warmly welcomed. Well-known coal miners and Stalin Prize winners were warmly welcomed at the meeting.

　　Soviet Coal Industry Minister Zasyadko delivered a speech, warmly congratulating the Soviet coal mining industry's great achievements. He said: Due to the mechanization of coal mining, Soviet coal production has greatly exceeded pre-war levels. By Miner's Day, coal miners have overfulfilled the plan by nearly one million tons of coal, and this year's labor productivity has increased by 11% compared to last year. The current task of Soviet miners is to transition from individual coal mining mechanization to the mechanization of the entire coal mining technical process.

　　Zasyadko continued: 81,000 Soviet miners have been awarded certificates and medals for their outstanding work. 150 miners and over 14,000 miners have been awarded the honorary titles of "Hero of Socialist Labor" and "Honorary Miner" respectively. The difference between mental and physical labor is being eliminated.

　　Soviet miners have enthusiastically participated in the Stakhanovite-style peaceful work shifts to support the cause of defending world peace.

　　Soviet Miners' Living Conditions are Greatly Improving

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th. Comprehensive TASS Moscow dispatch, 26th: On the eve of Soviet Miner's Day (August 27th), Soviet Deputy Minister of Coal Industry Kratenko wrote an article in Labor Daily discussing the achievements of the Soviet coal mining industry, stating: Coal miners throughout the Soviet Union are working hard to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. As early as the fourth quarter of 1949, they had already exceeded the 1950 coal production standards stipulated by the Five-Year Plan. This year's work has also been very successful. The second quarter production plan has been exceeded, and coal production has increased by 12% compared to the same quarter last year.

　　Kratenko pointed out: Miners' living conditions are greatly improving. Apartments with an area of 2.8 million square meters have been completed. During last year and the first six months of this year, tens of thousands of miners' families have moved into new homes. Mining areas such as Karaganda, Kemerovo, Makeyevka, and Gorlovka have become beautiful big cities. They are not only major industrial centers but also major cultural centers. Soviet miners now have 638 clubs, 35 cultural palaces, 820 libraries, thousands of entertainment halls, and many stadiums, aquatic sports stations, and parks. The living standards of Soviet miners have also greatly improved. Their average wage has increased to two and a half times that of pre-war levels. In mining areas such as Kuznetsk, the average wage has reached more than three times that of pre-war levels.

　　Soviet Coal Mining Mechanization Level is Number One in the World

　　Shcherasin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Coal Miners' Trade Union, said in a speech on the 24th that Soviet miners received more than 200 million rubles more in social insurance funds from the state this year than last year, and the coal mining industry trade union's social insurance funds are 1.9 billion rubles. About 80,000 miners rested in sanatoriums and rest homes this year, and various expenses were paid by this fund. In addition to normal wages, Soviet miners also receive various subsidies and allowances, thus increasing their income by 10% to 20%.

　　Soviet Deputy Minister of Coal Industry Bochenko wrote an article in Moscow's Pravda, pointing out: Soviet coal mines have become industrial enterprises equipped with the latest technology and equipment. Due to the adoption of hundreds of coal mining combines, powerful coal cutting machines, and electric locomotives, productivity has greatly increased, and labor conditions have also greatly improved. In terms of the level of mechanization of the main processes of coal mining, the Soviet Union ranks first in the world. Miners in Donbas and Moscow have achieved remarkable achievements, having increased coal production to three times that of pre-war levels.

　　莫斯科庆祝矿工节
    扎霞迪科报告矿工伟大成就
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联矿工节庆祝大会于二十六日在莫斯科工会大厦举行，与会的有工程师，技工，矿工，职员等。著名的煤矿工人与斯大林奖金获得者，在会上受到了热烈的欢迎。
    苏联煤矿工业部部长扎霞迪科发表演说，热烈祝贺苏联煤矿工业的巨大成就。他说：由于采煤业的机械化，苏联煤产已大大超过了战前水平，到矿工节这一天，煤矿工人已超计划产煤将近一百万吨，今年的劳动生产率已较去年提高了百分之十一。苏联矿工当前的任务就是从个别的采煤机械化过渡到整个采煤技术过程的机械化。
    扎霞迪科继称：苏联已有八万一千名矿工因卓越的工作荣获了奖状和勋章。有一百五十名及一万四千余名矿工分别荣膺社会主义劳动英雄及“荣誉矿工”的光荣称号。脑力与体力劳动之间的差别正在消灭中。
    苏联矿工已踊跃地参加了斯塔哈诺夫式的和平工作班，来支持保卫全世界和平的事业。
    苏矿工生活条件正在大大地改进
    【新华社二十八日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：在苏联矿工节（八月二十七日）的前一日，苏联煤业部副部长克拉坦科在劳动报上撰文论述苏联煤矿工业的成就称：全苏各地煤矿工人，都在努力提前完成战后五年计划。早在一九四九年第四季，他们就已超过了五年计划所规定的一九五○年的产煤标准。今年的工作也十分成功。第二季生产计划已被超过，煤产量较去年同季增加了百分之十二。
    克拉坦科指出：矿工的生活条件正在大大地改进。面积达二百八十万平方公尺的公寓已经落成。在去年和今年头六个月期间，已有数万矿工的家庭迁入新居。卡拉干达、基米罗伏、马基耶夫卡和高尔罗夫卡等矿区，已经变成了美丽的大城镇。它们不仅是主要的工业中心，而且成了主要的文化中心。苏联矿工现在拥有六百三十八所俱乐部，三十五个文化宫，八百二十所图书馆，数千个的娱乐厅，以及许多体育场、水上运动站和公园等。苏联矿工的生活水平也大大提高了。他们的平均工资已增加成为战前的两倍半。在库兹涅茨克等矿区，平均工资已达战前的三倍以上。
    苏联采煤机械化水平数世界第一
    苏联煤矿工业工会中央委员会书记雪拉辛于二十四日发表谈话称：苏联矿工今年从国家所得到的社会保险基金，比去年多二亿卢布，煤矿工业工会的社会保险经费为十九亿卢布。今年约有八万矿工在疗养院及休养所休息，各种费用就由这笔经费支付。苏联矿工除正常工资外，还得到各项补助与津贴，因而使他们的收入增加了百分之十到二十。
    苏联煤业部副部长波琴柯夫在莫斯科真理报上撰文指出：苏联煤坑已变成装备有最新技术设备的工业企业。由于采用了数百部采煤联合机、强有力的砍煤机以及电气机车等，生产力已大大增加，劳动条件也大为改善了。就煤矿开采的主要过程的机械化的水平来说，苏联是居世界首位的。顿巴斯与莫斯科的矿工已获得了显著的成就，他们已将煤产量提高到战前的三倍。
