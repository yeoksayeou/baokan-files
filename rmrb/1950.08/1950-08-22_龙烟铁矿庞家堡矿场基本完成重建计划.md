Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, August 19th. After more than ten months of restoration and reconstruction, the state-owned Longyan Iron Mine's Pangjiabao Mine has roughly restored its original appearance. In the first half of this year, the mine basically completed the old tunnel repair project originally scheduled to be completed by the end of September, saving more than 37,400 man-days. The new mine roadway development project also exceeded the first half of the year's plan by 18 percent. The repair plan for the ore transport road, originally scheduled to be completed by the end of July, was completed one month ahead of schedule and exceeded the plan. The mechanical and electrical equipment installation project has also been completed on schedule, except for a small portion where the plan was changed due to a lack of materials. Only the civil engineering construction project failed to complete the plan due to a lack of inspection and supervision of the contractor's construction situation. The restoration and reconstruction project of the mine began in September last year. After more than ten months of efforts, the mine has gradually possessed the conditions for large-scale mining, and the number of employees has also increased sixfold compared to last year. In the third quarter of this year, the mine will still focus on capital construction, but will produce a small amount of ore. According to exploration, the iron ore reserves of the mine are more than 190 million tons, and the iron content of the ore is as high as 52 to 62 percent. In order to plunder this rich resource, the Japanese invaders had a maximum of more than 25,000 employees in the mine during their rule, with a daily output of 6,000 tons of ore. Various equipment was also more modern. Later, it was destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits, and the mine was completely abandoned. After the liberation of the mine at the end of 1948, due to the local government's lack of attention to the protection of the mine, a large number of machines, equipment and other materials were lost. The above-mentioned phenomenon was not corrected until the autumn of 1949.

### 龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场基本完成重建计划

　　龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场基本完成重建计划
    【新华社张家口十九日电】经过十个多月的恢复和重建，国营龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场已粗略地恢复了原来的面目。今年上半年，该矿基本上完成了原定九月底完成的旧坑道整修工程；节省人工三万七千四百多个。新井巷开拓工程也超过上半年计划的百分之十八；原定七月底完成的运矿路的整修计划，提前一月完成，并有超过。机电设备按装工程，除小部分因材料缺乏计划改变外，也已如期完成。仅土木建筑工程，因对承包商施工情况缺乏检查督导，没有完成计划。该矿恢复和重建工程，开始于去年九月。过经十个多月的努力，现该矿已逐渐具备大量开采的条件，职工人数也较去年增加了六倍。今年第三季中，该矿仍以基本建设为主，但将出产少数矿砂。据探测，该矿铁矿藏埋量在一亿九千万吨以上，矿石含铁成份高达百分之五十二到六十二。日寇为掠夺这一富源，在其统治时该矿职工最高达到两万五千余人，日产矿砂六千吨。各项设备亦较近代化。以后遭国民党匪帮破坏，矿场完全荒废。一九四八年底该矿解放后，由于当地政府对保护矿场不予重视，机器设备和其他器材又有大量散失。直到一九四九年秋，上述现象始被纠正。
