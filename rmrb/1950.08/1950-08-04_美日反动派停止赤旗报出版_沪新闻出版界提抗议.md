　　US-Japanese Reactionaries Stop Publication of Red Flag Newspaper
    Shanghai Press and Publishing Circles Lodge Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th] Seventy-three newspapers and magazines in Shanghai's press and publishing circles, including *Liberation Daily*, *Xinwen Daily*, *Ta Kung Pao*, and *Wenhui Bao*, jointly published a protest on the 29th, protesting against the US reactionaries instructing their running dog, the Yoshida government, to "indefinitely" suspend the publication of the Japanese Communist Party's central organ, *Red Flag*, and other large numbers of patriotic newspapers and periodicals. The protest stated: "This fascist-style oppressive action by the US-Japanese reactionaries aims to deprive the Japanese people of freedom of speech and democratic rights, and to transform Japan into a US colony and a military base for attacking the people of Asia." The protest continued: "We, the press and publishing circles of Shanghai, hereby lodge an angry protest to the US reactionaries and their running dog, the Yoshida government, and extend our cordial greetings to the progressive press and publishing workers of Japan. We believe that the American aggressive robbers who oppose the people and enslave the people, no matter how rampant their arrogance may be, are bound to fail in the end; and the democratic struggle of the Japanese people and the democratic cause of the people of the world are bound to be victorious!"

　　美日反动派停止赤旗报出版
    沪新闻出版界提抗议
    【新华社上海三十日电】上海新闻出版界解放日报、新闻日报、大公报、文汇报等七十三家报纸杂志于二十九日联合发表抗议书，抗议美国反动派指使其走狗吉田政府“无限期地”停止日共中央机关报赤旗报以及其他大批爱国报刊的出版。抗议书中指出：“美日反动派这种法西斯式的压迫行动，目的在于剥夺日本人民的言论自由和民主权利，变日本为美国的殖民地和进攻亚洲人民的军事基地。”抗议书接着说：“我们上海的新闻出版界特向美国反动派及其走狗吉田政府提出愤怒的抗议，并向日本的进步新闻出版工作者致亲切的慰问。我们相信，反对人民、奴役人民的美国侵略强盗，不管它的气焰如何嚣张，结果必然失败；而日本人民的民主斗争与世界人民民主事业一定得到胜利！”
