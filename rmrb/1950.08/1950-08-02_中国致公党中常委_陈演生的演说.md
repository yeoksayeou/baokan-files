Xinhua News Agency, August 1st—Speech by Chen Yansheng, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, at the Beijing gathering celebrating the "August 1st" Army Day and the demonstration against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea:

Twenty-three years ago today, the Chinese Communist Party launched the armed uprising in Nanchang to resist the Kuomintang reactionaries who were surrendering to imperialism and oppressing the people. Although the victory of this uprising was short-lived due to objective circumstances and limitations of subjective strength, the Chinese people's armed forces had a foundation from then on. Later, in Jiangxi, they joined forces with the Hunan Workers' and Peasants' Armed Forces led by Chairman Mao. Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the Chinese people established armed forces for people's liberation. This can also be said to be the beginning of the Chinese revolution's march towards victory, because in China, only by using "armed revolution against armed counter-revolution" can the revolution be successfully completed!

Over the past twenty-three years, this armed revolutionary force has grown unprecedentedly strong and is being modernized through thousands of trials and struggles. It has not only defeated the armed forces of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, liberated almost all of mainland China, but it also has sufficient power to liberate Taiwan and other islands outside Taiwan, and completely eliminate the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. At the same time, it has also become a strong fortress for defending world lasting peace.

Recently, the American imperialists' aggression against Asia has become even more shameless, and they have even arrogantly launched a war of aggression against North Korea and aggression against our Taiwan. But in less than forty days, under the heroic struggle of the Korean People's Armed Forces, the American imperialists have been beaten and suffered heavy losses. This is enough to prove the strength of the people's power and also shows that the imperialists are just paper tigers who appear strong but are weak inside. We firmly believe that no matter what tricks the American imperialists play, in today's unprecedentedly strong people's power, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, this strong modernized People's Liberation Army has enough power to crush all the conspiracies of American imperialism and liberate all our own places, including Taiwan and Tibet!

I wholeheartedly congratulate the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and cheer in advance for the liberation of all the people of Asia!

### 中国致公党中常委  陈演生的演说

    陈演生的演说
    【新华社一日讯】中国致公党中常委陈演生在北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜示威大会上的演说：
    二十三年前的今天，中国共产党为了反抗投降帝国主义和压迫人民的国民党反动派，在南昌发动了武装起义。虽然，由于客观环境以及主观力量的限制，这个起义的胜利只是短时期的，然而中国人民的武装力量从此有了根基，而后来在江西与毛主席所领导的湖南工农武装会合，在毛主席英明领导之下，使中国人民建立了进行人民解放的武装力量，这也可以说是中国革命走向胜利的开端，因为在中国，只有以“武装的革命反对武装的反革命”，革命才会胜利完成！
    二十三年来，这一支武装革命力量经过了千万次的折磨与斗争，已成长得空前强大和正在近代化，不仅已打垮了美帝国主义和他的走狗蒋介石的武装力量，解放了几乎全部中国大陆的领土，而且它也有充分的力量解放台湾和台湾以外的其他岛屿，彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮残余，同时，它亦已成为保卫世界持久和平的坚强堡垒。
    最近美国帝国主义者对于亚洲的侵略更形无耻，居然狂妄地发起向北朝鲜进攻的侵略战争和侵略我们的台湾。但不到四十天，在朝鲜人民武装英勇斗争之下，美国帝国主义者已被打得头破血流。这足够证明人民力量的强大，也说明了帝国主义者只是外强中干的纸老虎。我们深深地相信，不管美国帝国主义者还要耍出些什么把戏，在人民力量空前壮大的今天，在毛主席、朱总司令领导下的这支坚强的近代化的人民解放军，是有足够力量粉碎美帝的一切阴谋，而把我们自己的一切地方，包括台湾、西藏解放出来！
    我衷心的祝贺中国人民解放军建军二十三周年，并预为亚洲全体人民的解放而欢呼！
