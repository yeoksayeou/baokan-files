Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Pipe Casting Department

　　Improves Iron Smelting Method, Production Efficiency Increased

　　Machine Shop Workers Successfully Imitate Power Hammer

　　[This newspaper reported] The workers of the Pipe Casting Department of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have achieved two new victories in the production competition.

　　(1) After the output of the Pipe Casting Department increased, the molten iron from the cupola furnace often could not be supplied in time, affecting the production of mold making, sand casting, and pipe casting departments. Gao Bocong (Youth League member), the head of the pipe casting workshop, after studying the internal structure of the furnace in detail, discussed with the veteran workers to improve the iron smelting operation method (reducing the height of the bottom coke in the furnace; changing the tuyeres from four rows to three rows; increasing the main tuyere), so that the coke could burn more completely. At the same time, the iron smelting method was improved (the iron charge for each layer was changed from the original one ton to 800 kilograms), so that the subsequent coke usage for each layer of iron charge was reduced from 12 percent to 8.12 percent. The experiment was successful on July 7th. Using the new method to smelt iron not only accelerated the melting speed of the iron, reducing the time for each package of molten iron (two tons) from 18 minutes to 15 minutes, initially solving the difficulty of not being able to supply molten iron in time, but also reduced the coke usage due to the increased melting rate. One kilogram of coke used to melt 8.2 kilograms of iron, but after the improvement, it can melt 11.7 kilograms of iron. The Pipe Casting Department melts 95 tons of iron per day. In the past, it required 12,360 kilograms of coke. Now, it only requires 8,405 kilograms, saving about 4 tons per day. At the same time, after the molten iron can be supplied in time, the workers of the first pipe casting shift have automatically proposed to cast 18 more iron pipes per month.

　　(2) The machine shop workers of the Pipe Casting Department successfully imitated the power hammer, solving a major production difficulty. The power hammer is the main tool for making pipes. The power hammers currently used by the department are still old items left by the Japanese invaders and are close to being unusable. They often break down throughout the year, requiring repairs every day. The machine shop workers were troubled by repairing the power hammers all day, so they proposed that the team leader and master craftsmen try to make one. After the leadership approved, the power hammer was disassembled for study and imitation. After workers Gong Fengqi, Wang Fengtong, Hua Baoshan, Hun Dexing, and others successively transformed tools such as eccentrics, oblique tires, milling cutters, and drill bits, they overcame difficulties such as deep hole drilling, oblique hole drilling, and cylinder milling, and successfully manufactured it on July 7th. After testing, it is no less than Japanese products. Preparations are now underway to continue manufacturing.

### 石景山钢铁厂铸管部  改进化铁熔铁方法生产效率提高  机器场工人仿制风锤成功

    改进化铁熔铁方法生产效率提高
    机器场工人仿制风锤成功
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂铸管部职工，在生产竞赛中，又获得了两项新的胜利。
    （一）铸管部产量提高后，化铁炉的铁水时常不能及时供应，影响制模、翻砂、铸管等部门的生产。铸管场主管高伯聪（青年团员）详细研究了炉的内部构造以后，与老工人商量着改进化铁的操作方法（减低炉内底焦的高度；将风眼由四排改为三排；加大主风口），使焦炭能较完全地燃烧。同时改进熔铁方法（每层铁料由原来的一吨，改薄为八百公斤），使每层铁料的后续焦炭使用量，由百分之十二降至百分之八点一二。七月七日试验成功。用新的方法熔铁，不仅加速了铁的熔解速度，使每包铁水（两吨）由十八分钟降至十五分钟，初步解决了铁水不能及时供应的困难，又因熔化率增高，减少了焦炭的使用量，一公斤焦炭过去熔化八点二公斤铁，改进后可化铁一一·七公斤。铸管部每日熔铁九十五吨，过去需用焦炭一万二千三百六十公斤，现只需八千四百零五公斤，每日约省四吨。同时，铁水能及时供应后，铸管第一班工人已自动提出每月多铸十八根铁管。
    （二）铸管部机器场工人仿制风锤成功，解决了生产上一大困难。风锤是制管主要工具，现该部使用的风锤仍是日寇留下的旧物，接近失用程度，一年来时常发生故障，每日修不胜修。机器场工人整日为修风锤烦恼，于是提议由带班和老师傅试制。经领导批准后，将风锤拆开研究、仿制。经过工人巩凤岐、王凤桐、滑宝山、浑德兴等先后改造偏心、斜胎、铣刀、钻头等工具，克服了打深眼、打斜眼铣缸等困难，于七月七日制造成功。经试验后，并不亚于日本制品。现正准备继续制造。
