　　Osaka Found Anti-American Leaflets
    Protesting the US Turning Japan into a Base of Aggression
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 29th - TASS, August 28th: Recently, many leaflets have been distributed in Osaka, a major industrial center in Japan, protesting against the US aggression in Korea and the transformation of Japan into a US military base. Japanese democrats point out that the distribution of these anti-American leaflets is proof of the Japanese people's growing anger at the aggressive policies of the American imperialists.
    Japanese authorities, under orders from MacArthur Headquarters, are stepping up their search for those who distributed the leaflets. It is reported that on the 27th, police in the suburbs of Osaka arrested the owner of a house, claiming that the printing press for the anti-American leaflets was located in his house.

　　大阪发现反美传单
    抗议美国把日本变为侵略基地
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社二十八日电引东京消息：最近有人在日本大工业中心大阪散发许多传单，抗议美国侵略朝鲜和把日本变为美国的军事基地。日本民主人士指出，散发这些反美传单，乃是日本人民对于美帝国主义者侵略政策日益感到愤怒的证明。
    日本当局根据麦克阿瑟总部的命令，正在加紧搜寻散发传单的人。据传，二十七日警察在大阪郊外将一所房屋的主人捕去，硬说印刷反美传单的印刷所就设在他的屋内。
