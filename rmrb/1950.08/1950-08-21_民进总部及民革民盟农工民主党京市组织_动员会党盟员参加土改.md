    Mobilize Party and League Members to Participate in Land Reform
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th] According to the Beijing Guangming Daily on the 18th: The China Association for Promoting Democracy headquarters has issued instructions, calling on members of all branches of the association to actively study and publicize the land reform policy and participate in land reform work. The instructions pointed out: (1) It is necessary to organize all members to study the land reform policy in a planned and led manner to improve our ideological understanding, so that every member can become a correct propagandist and interpreter of the land reform policy. (2) Carry out planned and regular publicity and explanation work to the masses, connect with reality, explain the reasons, and strive for the active support of the land reform policy from a wider range of the masses, and mobilize all forces to fight for the thorough implementation of the Land Reform Law. (3) All levels of organizations should actively organize members to participate in the actual work of land reform according to their own actual conditions, so as to be tempered and transformed. Members who apply to participate in land reform work must have the determination to endure hardship and persevere to the end. Once participating, they must strictly abide by and implement the government's policies and decrees, and obey unified training, unified allocation, and unified leadership.
    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League, and the Beijing Party Affairs Consolidation Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, in order to mobilize party and league members to participate in land reform work, and to study the theory and practice of land reform, held a city-wide mobilization meeting of party and league members on the evening of the 13th, inviting Chai Zemin, director of the Beijing Suburban Work Committee, to give a report. About 300 party and league members attended the meeting. Li Jishen, as chairman, first delivered an opening speech, explaining the great significance of this autumn's land reform and the importance of democratic parties participating in land reform. Then, Chai Zemin gave a report, explaining the actual situation and experience of land reform in the suburbs of Beijing, explaining the preparations that should be made beforehand and the steps for implementation, and pointed out the points that intellectuals should pay attention to when participating in land reform for the first time. The conference also had Zhou Xinmin convey the decision of the National Committee of the CPPCC on the participation of various democratic parties in land reform, and reported that party and league members who reside in centrally administered provinces and cities will be introduced by the Central People's Government to land reform areas for work; those who reside in land reform areas will participate in their own provinces and cities; and in rent reduction areas such as the Southwest Region, party and league members can also participate in rent reduction work. Then, Chen Mingshu called on party and league members at the meeting to enthusiastically participate in land reform. Finally, the chairman announced to the conference that those who wish to participate in land reform should register with the Beijing organizations of the party and the league within three days for review and forwarding.
    [Another report] The Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League, in order to actively respond to the call of the league headquarters to mobilize league members to participate in land reform, issued instructions to league members throughout the city a few days ago, calling on league members to strive to complete the task of passing the land reform test. More than 30 league members have now signed up to participate.
    The Central Working Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued "Instructions on Party Members Participating in Land Reform Work" on July 22nd in order to call on party members to enthusiastically participate in land reform work.
