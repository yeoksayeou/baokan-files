Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th. The Provisional Committee of the Overseas Chinese Federation in Seoul has sent a telegram to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace regarding the continuous bombing of peaceful towns and villages in Korea by American planes, which has caused overseas Chinese in Korea to suffer. The telegram accuses the American troops of barbarity. The telegram reads as follows:
To the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and forwarded to the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress: Since American imperialism directly and militarily attacked the Korean people, it has been met with heavy blows from the heroic Korean People's Army. The inhuman American imperialists, in retaliation for their shameful defeat, have carried out insane and barbaric bombing and strafing of peaceful Korean residents, causing the lives and property of our overseas Chinese to suffer innocently. On July 16th, due to the indiscriminate bombing of Seoul by American planes, more than 20 of our compatriots were killed, six were seriously injured, and property losses were extremely heavy, causing a large number of overseas Chinese to be homeless and destitute, wandering the streets. This blood debt was created single-handedly by the American imperialists. We, the entire overseas Chinese community residing in Seoul, hereby lodge a tearful accusation with the Motherland's People's Committee for World Peace and the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, appealing to the people of the entire country and the world who love peace to stop the American imperialists' acts of aggression.
Provisional Committee of the Overseas Chinese Federation in Seoul, July 20, 1950

　　美机炸死我华侨二十余名
    汉城华侨向祖国呼吁
    控诉美军兽行要求制止美国侵略
    【新华社平壤四日电】汉城市华侨联合会临时委员会顷就美机连日轰炸朝鲜和平城乡致使旅朝华侨同受灾害一事，致电中国保卫世界和平大会委员会及世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，控诉美军的兽行。电文略称：
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会并转世界和平大会常设委员会：美帝国主义自直接武装进攻朝鲜人民以来，已遭到英勇的朝鲜人民军的沉重打击。残无人道的美帝国主义者为报复其可耻的失败，竟对朝鲜和平居民进行疯狂的野兽般的轰炸与扫射，使我华侨生命财产，同罹无辜之难。七月十六日，由于美机对汉城的盲目轰炸，我侨胞死者二十余名，重伤六名，房屋财产损失綦重，造成大批侨胞无家无食，流离街头。这笔血债是美帝国主义者一手造成的。我们旅居汉城市的全体华侨，谨向祖国保卫世界和平大会委员会与世界和平大会常设委员会提出血泪的控诉，吁请全国及全世界爱好和平人民制止美帝国主义者的侵略行动。
  朝鲜汉城市华侨联合会临时委员会  一九五○年七月二十日
