Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: The activities of American imperialism to intensify its aggression in the Middle East and squeeze out British influence continue to arouse British suspicion. According to a report from the Electric Communication Agency in Washington on the 4th, King Abdullah of Transjordan, who was originally a major British puppet in the Middle East, recently sent a secret letter to Truman, selling himself to American imperialism and asking the United States to preside over the so-called "Greater Syria" plan. The plan calls for the unification of Transjordan, Syria, and Iraq under Abdullah's leadership to form a unified kingdom. Abdullah said in the letter that these countries would form an anti-communist, natural, economic, and military unit that could provide the strongest army in the Middle East. Abdullah requested extensive military and economic "aid" from the United States to support this union.

According to Washington sources, British Ambassador to the United States Franks visited the US State Department to express the British government's "extreme concern" that the US government had failed to inform them of the contents of Abdullah's secret letter. The British Ambassador also informed the US government of the opinion of British Foreign Secretary Bevin himself, saying that any further changes in the relative positions of Britain and the United States in the Middle East were in direct conflict with the interests of "defense" in the region.

　　美英侵略中东矛盾增多
    美导演“大叙利亚”计划引起英国猜忌
    【新华社九日讯】美帝国主义加紧侵略中东、排挤英国势力的活动，继续引起英国的猜忌。据电通社华盛顿四日电：原来是英国在中东主要傀儡的外约旦国王阿布杜拉，最近以密函致杜鲁门，向美国帝国主义卖身投靠，要求美国来主持所谓“大叙利亚”计划。该计划要求在阿布杜拉的领导下，联合外约旦、叙利亚、伊拉克，成为一个统一的王国。阿布杜拉在信中说，这些国家组成一个反共的、自然的、经济和军事的单位，可以供给一支中东最强大的军队。阿布杜拉要求美国给予广泛的军事上与经济上的“援助”，以支持这种联合。
    据华盛顿消息，英国驻美大使佛朗克斯曾往访美国国务院，表示英国政府对于美国政府未能将阿布杜拉密函的内容相告，“极为注意”。英大使并已将英外相贝文本人的意见通知美国政府说：英美在中东相对地位的任何进一步变更，与该地区“防务的利益，都是直接抵触的”。
