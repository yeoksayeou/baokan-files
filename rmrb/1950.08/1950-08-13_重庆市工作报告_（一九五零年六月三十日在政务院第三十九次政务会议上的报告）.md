　　Work Report of Chongqing Municipality
    (Report at the 39th Political Affairs Conference of the Government Administration Council on June 30, 1950)
    Chen Xilian, Mayor of Chongqing Municipal People's Government
    Chongqing was liberated on November 30th last year, and it has been almost seven months. The takeover of Chongqing was largely completed before the first Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference (January 23rd to February 2nd) was held in late January. Although we encountered many difficulties in the takeover work, under the correct leadership of our superiors, we adopted the attitude of consulting with all sectors on issues and handling them carefully. With the assistance of workers, students, and people from all walks of life, we were able to overcome the difficulties and successfully complete the "takeover" task. There were no major problems in the "takeover" work. However, in the subsequent transition from "takeover" to "management," towards the restoration and development of production, we experienced an even more difficult and painful process. In addition to the same difficulties experienced by other newly liberated cities, Chongqing's characteristics were:
    (1) Chongqing is an industrial and commercial city in Southwest China, with industry outweighing commerce, and state-owned enterprises (mainly military industries) exceeding private industries. The total number of enterprise workers is 200,000, and with their families, it totals about 500,000, accounting for nearly half of the city's population (1.2 million). Moreover, on the eve of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's retreat, under the direct guidance of the American imperialist Nolan, the Kuomintang transferred a technical brigade from Taiwan to carry out an inhuman massacre and destruction. Major state-owned factories such as the 10th, 20th, 21st, 24th, 29th, 31st, 50th, and Changshou Power Plant suffered significant losses. In particular, the power supply was destroyed by 14,545 kilowatts, and 572 important machines were damaged. At the beginning of Chongqing's liberation, the first issue was how to solve the restoration of a large number of state-owned enterprises.
    (2) Chongqing was liberated the latest. It was estimated that Chiang Kai-shek bandits had pre-arranged and concealed more than 6,000 secret agents, habitual bandits, and bandits who had fled from Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan. There were nearly 10,000 scattered soldiers. The "Self-Defense Army," renamed from the "Anti-Communist and People-Protecting Army," numbered about 20,000. At the same time, bandits were rampant in the countryside, and transportation was difficult. At the beginning of Chongqing's liberation, the issue of public security was also quite serious. This issue directly affected the work of restoring and developing production.
    In addition, Chongqing also experienced the national price fluctuations in January and February without exception. After the central government's unified financial and economic management and leadership, the collection of grain taxes and the issuance of public bonds to balance national financial revenue and expenditure stabilized currency and prices. The market also experienced a period of sluggish sales. Both public and private industrial and commercial enterprises felt many difficulties. However, these difficulties are temporary. The situation has recently begun to improve.
    I. On the Issue of Restoring and Developing Industry and Commerce
    Thanks to the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and thanks to the joint efforts of the government, workers, and industrialists and businessmen, Chongqing's industrial and commercial situation has gradually entered a new stage. In particular, the central government has approved the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, state-owned enterprises have resumed work one after another, and many private factories have received orders. The stagnant situation has changed. This also proves what Director Chen Yun said in his report: "Whether it is for the entire national economy or for private industry, the position of the government and state-owned enterprises entrusting private factories with processing and ordering goods from private factories is relatively important today." The specific situation of the government and state-owned enterprises using processing, ordering, purchasing, and loans to help private factories overcome current difficulties and restore production is listed below:
    In terms of purchasing and ordering: As of the end of May, the total amount of cash invested by state-owned trading companies in purchasing various goods from private factories reached 128.4 billion yuan. Various cotton yarn companies invested a total of 21 billion yuan in purchasing yarn and cloth. Department stores invested 13.4 billion yuan in purchasing, of which 70% was used to purchase from private factories. Native produce companies invested 36.2 billion yuan in purchasing materials such as bristles and sheepskins. The oil and fat company invested a total of 7.8 billion yuan in purchasing, and purchased 1,079 tons of tung oil by the end of April. The ordering of alcohol, rubber, knitwear, leather, native cloth, coal mines, and other industries has also played a significant role in supporting them. The military has independently placed orders with private factories for items such as rain cloth, biscuits, and leather shoes, which are all large quantities and have not been included in the calculation. In terms of entrusted processing: Grain companies have successively supplied more than 40 rice mills with 78,000 dan of rice for processing. Cotton yarn companies supplied 43,400 dan of raw cotton to the cotton yarn industry for processing in March and April. In terms of loans: The Chongqing branch of the People's Bank of China had lent a total of 42.5 billion yuan from its opening to May 20, of which more than 90% was lent to private factories. For example, the reason why the Minsheng Shipping Company was able to overcome the difficulties in its recovery of production was mainly due to the large amount of loans provided by the bank. In order to more effectively support private industry and commerce, a unified procurement agency was established under the leadership of the Municipal Finance Committee, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce was established.
    Although there are still many difficulties in the work of restoring industrial and commercial production in Chongqing, from these four months, it has begun to change, and the phenomenon of stagnation is gradually changing. For example, in terms of starting work, according to the materials of the first phase of industrial registration, a total of 2,918 companies in coal mines, textiles, matches, native cloth, towels, knitwear, leather making, rubber, rice milling, machinery, electrical engineering, cigarettes, and other industries. Now 2,655 have started work, accounting for 91%. In terms of production and sales, many industries have increased their average monthly output compared with the three months before liberation. For example, the current monthly output of washed coke and bituminous coal in coal mines, Lux shoes in the rubber industry, socks and towels in the knitwear industry, face and lining leather, belts, and sole leather in the leather-making industry, light bulbs, batteries, and yarn-covered wire in the electrical equipment industry, and flour machines, lathes, water turbines, cast steel, pig iron castings, tacks, and velvet sticks in the machinery industry. Compared with the average monthly output in the three months before liberation, it is 109% to 265%. Among them, cast steel is 986%, lathes are 1,100%, and belts are 1,402%. In terms of sales, the current monthly sales of towels, socks, belts, light bulbs, and yarn-covered wire are 100% to 250% compared with the average monthly sales in the three months before liberation. The sales of cast steel reached 1,126%, and velvet sticks reached 2,650%. Of course, the current production and sales are still small. However, comparing with the average production and sales volume in the three months before liberation, we can see the general trend of restoring production. In addition, the monthly increase in the amount of remittances to and from the whole country also shows this trend.
    II. On Labor-Capital Dispute Issues
    After the liberation of Chongqing, labor-capital disputes were a difficult issue to handle. From late January to late May, a total of 568 labor-capital dispute cases were accepted, 472 were resolved, and 96 remained to be processed. These labor-capital disputes are most common in small and medium-sized industries. Labor-capital disputes are inseparable from the difficulties of industry and commerce. The main reasons are the old and unreasonable management system and management mechanism in private industry and commerce, which lead to high product costs, unplanned production in the past, and bandits disrupting and hindering urban-rural exchanges, resulting in sluggish sales, shutdowns, and closures. Secondly, the workers suffered political and economic oppression and exploitation before liberation. Once they were liberated, they inevitably developed excessive demands and left-leaning emotions.
    To solve labor-capital disputes, the joint efforts of the government, workers, and industrial and commercial capitalists are needed. The government has always adhered to the principle of "both labor and capital benefit" and handles these labor disputes based on the three documents "on handling labor-capital relations" promulgated by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. On the worker side, the vast majority adopted the attitude of taking the initiative to frankly negotiate with the capitalists and overcome the difficulties together. For example, the workers of Tianfu Coal Mine took the initiative to negotiate with the capitalists to overcome the difficulties. The workers of Datong Department Store automatically reduced their wages by 40%, reduced their meals from five dishes and one soup to two dishes and one soup, and gave up business bonuses from March. There are many other facts such as voluntarily reducing wages, voluntarily postponing wage payments, lowering food standards, automatically saving raw materials, and reducing costs in order to maintain production. A few workers still have some excessive demands, but this is easy to persuade and correct. The capitalists have generally further understood the government's financial and economic policies, frankly discussed with the workers, and put the difficult issues on the table, and jointly studied with the government and the workers to overcome the difficulties. In this way, there are no unsolvable difficulties. Tianfu Coal Mine, Shashi Yarn Factory, and so on are examples. However, some industries where disputes occur still adopt the old set, and still adopt an unfriendly attitude towards the government and the workers, and even push the responsibility for the disputes to the government and the workers. This makes the problem difficult to solve, delays the time, and causes many unnecessary losses to production.
    Under the general trend of improving the general situation of industry and commerce, labor-capital disputes are relatively few and easier to solve. We have decided to further understand the overall production situation and the actual situation of various industries, and give guidance on overcoming difficulties (this is the fundamental way to resolve labor-capital disputes). We will gradually promote the signing of collective contracts and establish labor-capital consultation committees in various industries. At the same time, we will effectively relieve and resettle unemployed workers, stabilize the emotions of workers in the industry, and thus eliminate the hesitation in necessary employment or dismissal in various industries. This will improve and reduce disputes between labor and capital.
    About 20,000 unemployed workers have been registered in Chongqing. According to recent estimates, the number of unregistered workers will not exceed 30,000. We will do our best to resettle and relieve them. From the current production situation in Chongqing, this is entirely possible.
    III. On Public Security Work
    Public security work was a serious issue in Chongqing. After several months of joint efforts by the government and the people, the social order in Chongqing has been basically stabilized. After arresting a group of ringleaders of bandits and habitual bandits on January 18, with the assistance and reporting of the masses, the number of Kuomintang agents and habitual bandits who registered for self-renewal increased. It was relatively calm for a period of time. However, from mid-February to mid-March, many heinous and unrepentant leading bandit agents thought that the "storm had passed" and that we were negligent and slack. In particular, due to our victory in suppressing bandits in the countryside, they turned to urban activities and were extremely rampant for a time, colluding with habitual bandits, organizing guerrillas, robbing, destroying factories, impersonating our military and political personnel to extort money, blatantly throwing grenades on the streets (the principal has been arrested and executed), and carrying out assassinations, etc. We correctly used the policy of combining strict suppression with leniency, mobilized the people to participate in the work of eliminating bandits and agents, and carried out another arrest of the main bandits and agents who continued to do evil on May 19, giving the bandits and agents another blow. At the same time, during this period, we carried out the work of collecting and transforming beggars and vagrants, and a total of more than 7,100 beggars and vagrants were collected. Most of them were organized to carry out labor reform, and a very small number of old, weak, disabled, and sick were organized into nursing homes and taken in. We also vigorously reorganized the order of the docks, abolished the feudal "head system" and layers of exploitation, and mobilized and organized dock workers. Especially after the establishment of the transportation company, the order of the docks has greatly improved, and the general labor costs are lower than Wanxian and Yichang, and even lower than Shashi and Wuhan.
    In terms of robbery cases, a total of 183 cases occurred from January to April, and 156 cases were solved (10 cases occurred in April). No robbery cases occurred in the first half of May. Robbery cases are gradually decreasing. As our relationship with the masses becomes closer and with the assistance of the people, our ability to solve cases is gradually improving.
    Due to the victory in suppressing bandits in the countryside and the continuous achievements in the work of eliminating bandits and agents in the city, urban-rural exchanges have gradually become active, which has greatly helped the recovery of industry and commerce.
    This is an overview of the main tasks of Chongqing after liberation.
    Chairman Mao instructed us in his opening speech at the Second Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC: Our task is "to fight for a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation of the country." This is the general direction of the Chinese people's efforts. In the future, we will continue to work hard to push forward the work of restoring and developing production based on Chairman Mao's instructions and based on the actual situation in Southwest China and Chongqing. At the same time, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will immediately launch a campaign to rectify the cadres' work style, correct the existing commandism and bureaucracy in the work, overcome the shortcomings in the past work, and improve the work one step further. We believe that our work will definitely achieve new results.

　　重庆市工作报告
    （一九五零年六月三十日在政务院第三十九次政务会议上的报告）
    重庆市人民政府市长  陈锡联
    重庆市是在去年十一月三十日解放的，时间已快七个月了。重庆的接管工作在一月下旬重庆市第一次各界人民代表会议（一月二十三日至二月二日）召开之前，已大体告一段落。在接管工作上，虽然遇到很多困难，但在上级的正确领导之下，我们采取了遇事同各界商议和慎重处理问题的态度，并且在工人、学生和各界人士从各方面协助之下，得以克服困难，胜利完成了“接”的任务，在“接”的工作上没有出大毛病。但是在此后从“接”到“管”，向着恢复与发展生产的转化过程中，经历了更艰难的痛苦过程。除了与其他新解放城市经历了同样的困难之外，重庆的特点在于：
    （一）重庆是西南的一个工商业城市，工业重于商业，公营企业（主要是军工工业）超过私营工业。企业工人总数二十万，连家属共为五十万人左右，几占全市人口（一百二十万）之半数。而且在蒋匪溃退前夕，在美帝国主义者诺兰直接指导之下，国民党从台湾调来技术大队进行了一次绝灭人性的大屠杀大破坏。主要的公营工厂如第十、第二十、第二十一、第二十四、第二十九、第三十一、第五十及长寿电厂等都遭受重大损失。尤其动力被破坏了一万四千五百四十五基罗瓦特，重要机器损毁了五百七十二部。重庆解放之初，首先是如何解决为数很大的公营企业的恢复问题。
    （二）重庆解放最晚，蒋匪预先布置潜伏的匪特、惯匪、及自沪、宁、汉等地逃来的匪特估计在六千以上，散兵游勇近一万人，由“反共保民军”改名的“自卫军”约二万人。同时乡间土匪四起，交通困难。重庆解放之初，治安问题亦是相当严重的问题。这一问题直接影响着恢复与发展生产的工作。
    此外，重庆也无例外地经历了一、二月份全国性的物价波动。在中央统一财经工作的管理和领导，征收粮税发行公债以平衡国家财政收支，稳定了通货和物价之后，市场上亦同样出现了一度的滞销状态。公私工商业都曾感到很多困难。但是，这些困难是暂时的。最近情况已开始好转。
    一、关于恢复与发展工商业问题
    由于中央人民政府及西南军政委员会的正确领导，由于政府、工人、和工商业家的共同努力，重庆的工商业情况已逐渐进入一新的情况。特别是由于中央已批准兴修成渝铁路，公营企业先后复工，许多私营厂商获得订货，停滞的局面已改变了。这里也证明了陈云主任在报告中所说的“由政府和国营企业委托私营工厂加工及向私营工厂订货，不论是对于整个国民经济或对于私营工业来说，在今天所占的地位都是比较重要的。”兹将政府与国营企业以加工、订货、收购及贷款等办法，有计划地扶助私营厂商克服目前困难恢复生产的具体情形列下：
    在收购定货方面：至五月底为止，国营贸易公司向私营厂商收购各种货品所投放的现金总数达一千二百八十四亿，各花纱布公司收购纱、布共投放现金计二百一十亿，百货公司在收购中投放现金一百三十四亿，其中用作向私营厂商收购者占百分之七十。土产公司收购猪鬃、羊皮等物资共放出现金三百六十二亿，油脂公司在收购中共投放现金七十八亿，至四月底计收购桐油一千零七十九吨。对酒精、橡胶、针织、皮革、土布、煤矿等业的定货也起了不小的扶助作用。军需方面自行向私营厂商的定货，如雨布、饼干、皮鞋等皆系大宗，尚未计算在内。在委托加工方面：粮食公司先后供四十多家碾米厂加工米七万八千余担，花纱布公司三、四两月份供应棉纱业加工原棉四万三千四百余担。在贷款方面：人民银行重庆分行自开业到五月二十日为止，共贷出款项计四百二十五亿元，其中百分之九十以上是贷给私营厂商的。如航运业之民生公司所以能够度过其在恢复生产中的困难，银行给以多量贷款是一个主要的原因。为了更有力地扶助私营工商业，在市财委领导之下建立了统一采购的机构，并成立了工商联合会。
    重庆恢复工商业生产工作，虽然仍存在着许多困难，但从这四个月来看，已开始有了变化，正在逐步转变停滞的现象。如在开工上，据第一期工业登记的材料，煤矿、纺织、火柴、土布、毛巾、针织、制革、橡胶、碾米、机器、电工、纸烟等业共计二千九百一十八家，现在已有二千六百五十五家开工，占百分之九十一。在产销上，许多行业较解放前三个月的平均月产量有了增加。如煤矿等中的洗焦、烟煤，橡胶业中的力士鞋，针织业中的袜子、毛巾，制革业中的面里皮、皮带、底皮，电工器材业中的灯泡、电池、纱包线，机器业中的面机、车床、水轮机、铸钢、生铁铸件、元钉、绒棍等，目前的月产量与解放前三个月的平均月产量对比，为百分之一百零九至二百六十五。其中铸钢为百分之九百八十六，车床为百分之一千一百，皮带为百分之一千四百零二。在销量方面，如毛巾、袜子、皮带、灯泡、纱包线等，目前的月销量与解放前三个月的平均月销量的对比，为百分之一百至二百五十。铸钢的销量达到百分之一千一百二十六，绒棍为百分之二千六百五十。当然目前的产销量仍然是微小的。但与解放前三个月的平均产销量的对比，则可以看到恢复生产的一般动态。此外，从与全国汇兑汇款数量的逐月增加，亦可以看到此种动态。
    二、关于劳资争议问题
    重庆解放后，劳资纠纷曾是颇难处理的问题。自一月下旬至五月下旬，共受理劳资纠纷案件五百六十八件，已解决的四百七十二件，尚待处理的九十六件。这些劳资纠纷以中小型行业为最多。劳资纠纷是与工商业的困难分不开的，主要是由于私营工商业中旧的不合理的管理制度和管理机构致使产品成本高，由于过去无计划的生产，以及由于土匪扰乱、阻碍城乡交流等原因，发生商品滞销、停工、歇业等问题。其次是工人方面，在解放前深受着政治上和经济上的压迫剥削，一旦获得解放，不可免地一度产生一种过高的要求和左的情绪。
    在解决劳资纠纷问题上，需要政府、工人和工商资本家三方面的共同努力。政府方面是始终坚持着“劳资两利”的原则，并依据全国总工会所颁布的“关于处理劳资关系”的三个文件，来处理这些劳资争议的。工人方面，绝大多数采取了主动与资方开诚协商，共同度过难关的态度，如天府煤矿工人主动与资方协商，克服困难。大同百货公司工人自动减低工资百分之四十，降低伙食由五菜一汤改为两菜一汤，并从三月份起放弃营业奖金。其他如自动减低工资、自愿工资延期发给，降低伙食标准，自动节约原料，减低成本以求维持生产的事实是很不少的。少数工人尚有些过高的要求，但这是容易说服和纠正的。资方一般的已进一步认识了政府的财经政策，开诚与工人商谈，并把困难问题摊在桌子上，与政府和工人共同研究克服困难办法，这样，困难就没有不能解决的。天府煤矿、沙市纱厂等即是例子。但某些发生纠纷的行业，仍是采取旧的一套，对政府与工人仍是采取不友好的态度，甚至把纠纷责任推到政府和工人身上。这样就使问题不好解决，拖延时日，使生产遭受许多不应有的损失。
    在工商业一般情况好转的总的趋势之下，劳资纠纷问题是比较少而且比较容易解决了。我们决定进一步了解整个生产情况和各行各业的实际情况，给予克服困难的指导（这是解决劳资争议的根本的办法）。逐步推动签订集体合同，并在各行各业中成立劳资协商委员会。同时，切实救济与安置失业工人，安定在业工人情绪，从而免除各业在必要添雇或解雇中的犹疑。这样就能改善和减少劳资间的纠纷。
    重庆的失业工人已登记的约二万人，据最近估计连未登记者不会超过三万人。我们将尽力予以安置和救济，从重庆目前的生产情况来看，这是完全可能的。
    三、关于治安工作
    治安工作在重庆曾是一个相当严重的问题。经过政府与人民大众几个月的共同努力，重庆的社会秩序已基本上安定了。在一月十八日对一批首恶的匪特与惯匪实施逮捕之后，在群众的协助与检举之下，国民党特务与惯匪登记自新的是增多了。一个时期较平静。但在二月中旬至三月中旬，许多万恶的，不知悛悔的匪特首要分子以为“风势避过”，以为我们疏忽懈怠了，特别是由于我们在乡村剿匪的胜利，而又转入城市活动，一度极为猖狂，勾结惯匪，组织游击队，进行抢劫，破坏工厂，冒充我军政人员进行敲诈，明目张胆地在大街上投掷手榴弹（主犯已被捕正法）及实行暗刺等等。我们正确地运用了严厉镇压和宽大处理相结合的方针，动员起人民大众参加肃清匪特的工作，并在五月十九日对继续作恶的首要匪特实行再一次的逮捕，给予匪特再一次的打击。同时在此时期，我们曾进行了收容与改造乞丐游民的工作，计共收容乞丐游民七千一百余名，大部组织起来进行劳动改造，极少数老弱残废则组织教养院，收养起来。我们并以大力整理了码头的秩序，废除了封建的把头制与层层剥削，动员与组织起码头工人，特别是在搬运公司成立之后，码头秩序已大为改观，而一般力资较万县、宜昌为低，较沙市、武汉更低。
    在抢案方面，一至四月份共发生一百八十三件，共破获一百五十六件（四月份发生十件），五月份上半月未发生抢案，抢案在逐渐减少。在我们与群众的关系日益密切，在人民的协助之下，我破案能力亦逐渐提高。
    由于乡村剿匪的胜利及城市肃清匪特工作获得不断的成绩，城乡交流逐渐活跃，对工商业的恢复有极大的帮助。
    这是重庆市在解放后几个主要工作的概况。
    毛主席在政协全国委员会第二次会议开幕词中指示我们：我们的任务是“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”。这是中国人民努力的总方向。今后，我们将根据毛主席的指示，根据西南和重庆市的实际情况，继续努力，把恢复与发展生产的工作再向前推进一步。同时，我们根据毛主席的指示，即刻展开干部整风工作，纠正在工作中所已存在的命令主义，官僚主义作风，克服过去工作中的缺点，把工作提高一步。相信我们的工作一定能获得新的成绩。
