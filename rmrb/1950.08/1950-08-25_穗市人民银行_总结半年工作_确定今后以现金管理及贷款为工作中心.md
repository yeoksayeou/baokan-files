　　People's Bank of Guangzhou
    Summarizes Half-Year Work
    Determines to Focus on Cash Management and Loans in the Future
    [Our Newspaper Guangzhou News] The People's Bank of Guangzhou convened a summary meeting on July 27, which concluded in early August, summarizing the work of the past six months. The meeting considered that although Guangzhou is a new district and the institutions have not been established for long, due to the victory of national financial and economic measures and the stability of prices, the bank's various businesses have also greatly developed.
    For example, deposits increased more than tenfold from January to June, exceeding the task given by the head office by 1.25 times. Remittance business has also greatly developed, with outward remittances accounting for 95.45% of the total outward remittances of public and private banks and firms in the city, and inward remittances accounting for 91.3%.
    Loans were vigorously issued from June, reaching a cumulative total of 53.2 billion yuan by the end of the month. When issuing loans, the bank mostly adopted the method of "borrowing in whole and repaying in installments" for commercial entities; for large clients, it also grasped their production plans and financial plans.
    The cash management work has also initially achieved cash being returned to the bank, reducing cash payments from 19.41% in early May to 13.2% in early June.
    For vault work, various vaults were established successively from March, and a total of 565.6 billion yuan of currency was recovered by the end of June. The cashier work, although particularly heavy during this stage, errors have gradually decreased. However, due to the uneven quality of internal personnel, there were cases of stealing money, colluding with outsiders to exchange fake silver dollars, and exchanging large bills for small bills. There were even cases of workers colluding with bandits and special agents to attempt to rob the vault, as well as special agents using counterfeit money, saboteurs using bamboo sticks to steal bundled tickets, and using fake seals, or using water to open the bank's seals and re-attaching them to bundles with incorrect amounts.
    In addition, financial management work: In the past, a relatively large task was assisting in sweeping up underground money houses. Now, it is assisting relevant agencies in investigating and cracking down on gold smuggling and sellers. The policy of dredging and uniting was adopted for the management of banks and firms, so it played a certain role in organizing floating capital to support industry and commerce.
    At the summary meeting, everyone unanimously believed that although great achievements have been made in the past six months, there are still many shortcomings: First, in terms of leadership methods, the research on work and instructions from superiors is poor, and the work has not been summarized in a timely manner to absorb experience and improve cadres and work. In work, there is more deployment and less inspection, and it is not deep enough. Planning is insufficient, the center is not clear, and the steps are chaotic, forming bureaucratic leadership and getting bogged down in day-to-day affairs. In the future, we must improve leadership methods and strengthen planning and inspection work. Second, some improvements have been made in the bank's procedures in the past six months, but it is far from enough. In the future, we must mobilize everyone to simplify procedures, facilitate customers as much as possible, and raise it to the height of the mass perspective to oppose bureaucracy. Third, future work should focus on "cash management and loans," and other businesses should be combined with this center in a step-by-step manner. On the issue of cash management, we must request the Finance Committee to convene a meeting to solve the problems of some agencies' understanding and technical problems regarding cash management, and the bank should try its best to facilitate the withdrawal of funds by various agencies and strengthen the spirit of service. The expenditure plan must be compiled in September in accordance with the regulations of the superior. In terms of loan work: It was reviewed that the role of loans was reduced in the past due to a large degree of blindness and relief views. It was decided that in the future, we must actively obtain the assistance of the Adjustment and Handling Committee, closely combine with the adjustment and reorganization work, vigorously develop acceptance and joint transportation business to promote the exchange of materials between inside and outside the city and between urban and rural areas; we should vigorously help industries that adapt to Guangdong's economic conditions and have development prospects; we should gradually recover those without development prospects, concentrate the use of loans, and give greater play to the role of loans. Two deviations occurred in the lending process: one is the conservative thinking of bank cadres, who are afraid that loans will not be recovered, and they are hesitant; the other is the idea of "using public funds for private purposes," constantly blaming the bank for not granting loans and asking the bank to lower the conditions; but who to lend to and whether there is a guarantee of recovery is not considered. These two ideas were also criticized at the meeting. Now, loans are mostly secured by machinery and real estate mortgages and credit loans, and there are already bad debts. In the future, the general principle should be to hold hot commodities as collateral and try to obtain the deposit of collateral into the bank's warehouse as much as possible. More importantly, in the future, loans must strengthen the grasp of the borrower's production plans and financial plans; and must obtain the cooperation of all parties. In terms of deposits: we must gradually reduce the weaknesses such as more public deposits and fewer private deposits, and more current deposits and fewer time deposits. Now that prices have stabilized, the conditions for striving for fixed-term and longer-term monetary deposits are already mature. At the same time, in addition to strengthening cash management for public funds, we must also appropriately pay attention to absorbing private floating capital, sending out field personnel, actively striving for private depositors, and increasing the proportion of private deposits. For remittance work, speed and accuracy are required. We must overcome the past incidents of wrong telegrams for round-trip inquiries and missed remittances. Financial management work should prohibit gold smuggling, prevent counterfeiting, and guide banks and firms to prevent all financial speculation and random penalties and handling.
    The meeting also pointed out that in order to complete these heavy tasks, personnel work must be strengthened to overcome the state of not understanding cadres, unsound personnel systems, and personnel work lagging behind business development in the past. Education work needs to be improved in terms of methods and leadership in order to improve cadres and improve work. (Lin Shu)

### 穗市人民银行  总结半年工作  确定今后以现金管理及贷款为工作中心

　　穗市人民银行
    总结半年工作
    确定今后以现金管理及贷款为工作中心
    【本报广州讯】广州市人民银行，于七月二十七日召开总结会议，八月初结束，总结了半年来的工作。会议认为：广州虽是新区，机构建立未久，但由于全国财经措施的胜利，物价稳定，该行各项业务也有了很大的发展。
    如存款由一月到六月，增加十倍以上，超过了总行给予任务的一·二五倍。汇兑业务亦有很大开展，汇出占全市公私行庄总汇出数的百分之九十五点四五，汇入占百分之九十一点三。
    贷款由六月份起大力贷放，至月底累计达五百三十二亿元，贷放时对商业多采取整借零还；对大户并掌握其生产计划、财务计划。
    现金管理工作亦初步做到了现金归行，使现金支付由五月上旬的百分之十九点四一减到六月上旬的百分之十三点二。
    金库工作，由三月份起陆续建立各种金库，到六月底共回笼货币五千六百五十六亿元。出纳工作，这个阶段虽然特别繁重，但错误已逐渐减少。只是由于内部人员良莠不齐，发现有偷钱的，勾通外面兑进假银元的，大票倒小票等现象，甚至有工友勾通土匪特务，企图劫库，以及特务用假钞，破坏分子用竹签偷包捆好的票子，用假封签，用水启了该行封签改贴在数目不符的捆扎上等。
    另外，金融管理工作：过去比较大的工作是协助扫荡地下钱庄，现在则协助有关机关查缉黄金走私，打击黄金走私捣卖者。对行庄管理，采取疏导、团结的方针，故在组织游资扶助工商业方面起了一定的作用。
    总结会议上，大家一致认为：半年来，虽然成绩很大，但还存在着许多缺点：一、在领导方法上，对工作和上级指示研究差，对工作未及时总结，吸收经验，提高干部和工作。在工作上布置多、检查少，且不够深入，计划性不够，中心不明确，步骤紊乱，形成事务主义、官僚主义的领导。今后必须提高领导方法，加强计划与检查工作。二、半年来该行手续上有了些改进，但很不够，今后必须发动大家简化手续，尽量方便顾客，并应该把它提高到群众观点，反对官僚主义的高度上来认识。三、今后工作要抓住“现金管理与贷款”为中心，其他业务围绕这个中心有步骤的结合进行。在现金管理问题上，要提请财委召开会议解决有些机关关于现金管理上的认识问题与技术问题，银行并尽量做到方便各机关提解款，加强服务精神。九月份必须按上级规定编制出纳计划。贷款工作方面：检讨了过去由于带有很大的盲目性和救济观点，因而降低了贷款的作用。决定今后要主动取得调整处理委员会的帮助，密切结合调整改组工作，用大力开展押汇、联运业务，促进内外城乡间物资交流；对适应广东经济条件且有发展前途的工业，应大力帮助；无发展前途的逐渐收回，将贷款集中使用，发挥贷款的更大作用。在放款中发生两种偏向：一种是银行干部的保守思想，怕放款收不回，缩手缩脚；一种是“以公养私”的思想，天天责备银行不贷款，要银行降低条件；但对放给谁，有无保证收得回来否，是不考虑的。这两种思想，在会议上也受到了批判。现在贷款多为机器房产抵押及信用放款，已有呆账。今后一般的应持热货抵押原则，和尽可能的争取押品入银行仓库。更加重要的，今后放款要加强对贷户生产计划、财务计划的掌握；并要取得各方面的配合。存款方面：要逐渐减除公家存款多私人存款少、活期存款多定期存款少等弱点。现在物价已经稳定，争取定期的较长期的货币存款条件已经成熟。同时，除了对公家的款子加强现金管理外，并要适当地注意吸收私人游资，派出外勤人员，主动争取私人存户，增加私人存款比例。对汇兑工作，要求迅速正确，必须克服过去错了电报往返查询，漏解汇款的事件。金融管理工作，禁止黄金走私，进行防假并疏导行庄防止一切金融投机活动及乱罚、乱处理的行为。
    会议并指出：为了完成这些繁重的任务，必须加强人事工作，克服过去对干部不了解，人事制度不健全，人事工作落后于业务发展的状态。教育工作在方法上、领导上均需要改善，以便提高干部，改进工作。（林舒）
