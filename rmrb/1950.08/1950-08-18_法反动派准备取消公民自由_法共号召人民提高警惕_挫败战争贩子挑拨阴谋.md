　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 15th: According to TASS, "L'Humanité" published a letter from the French Communist Party to the French people, stating that the governments of Marshall Plan countries, caught in the vortex of accelerated war preparations, have witnessed a rising tide of anger from people who desire to live in freedom and peace against them. Therefore, they intend to resort to force and suppression, preparing to abolish civil liberties and create an atmosphere of dictatorship.

　　According to reliable sources: French reactionaries are preparing a large-scale anti-communist provocation in order to find an excuse for large-scale suppression. The commander of this action is Defense Minister Moc, who simultaneously controls the Ministry of the Interior and the national police. The organizers of the provocation are fascinated by the example of those who set fire to the German Reichstag. They are preparing forged documents and plan to use them during the parliamentary recess to strike at the working class, democratic peace advocates, and the Communist Party.

　　The Communist Party urges the working people, patriots, and all upright people to strengthen unity and vigilance in order to thwart the war-mongers' provocative conspiracies by all possible means and prevent the protectors of the working class and the defenders of freedom and peace from being attacked.

　　法反动派准备取消公民自由
    法共号召人民提高警惕  挫败战争贩子挑拨阴谋
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：《人道报》刊载法国共产党告法国人民书称：被卷入加速战争准备政策之漩涡中的马歇尔化各国政府，看到了那些希望自由和平生活的人民激起了愤怒的高潮来反对他们。因此，他们便打算诉诸武力与镇压手段，准备取消公民自由并制造一种独裁的空气。
    根据可靠消息：法国反动派正在准备一个大规模的反共挑拨行动，以便找寻借口来进行大规模的镇压。这个行动的指挥者就是同时控制着内政部和全国警察的国防部长莫克。挑拨行动的组织者醉心于那些纵火焚烧德国国会的人们的榜样，他们正在准备伪造的文件，打算在议会休会期间加以利用，以便打击工人阶级、民主和平拥护者以及共产党。
    共产党敦促劳动人民、爱国志士和一切正直的人民加强团结，加强警觉性，以便用一切可能的方法来挫败战争贩子的挑拨阴谋，使工人阶级的保护者、自由与和平的保卫者不致受到打击。
