Mr. Zhu Ziqing's Poems and Essays
	Wang Yao
    I
    Mr. Zhu Ziqing studied philosophy in university, and we can still see his articles on psychology in "New Tide". The May Fourth Movement prompted him to embark on the path of creation, and he began to write poetry. Poetry was the earliest department to bear fruit in the "Literary Revolution", although it did not have as abundant harvests as novels did from the beginning. This had a bit of combat significance at the time. Because novels still had old novels such as Water Margin and Dream of the Red Chamber to learn from; while rhyme literature was regarded as a treasure by old literature. The literary revolution must seize power in the land of poetry to be considered successful, and not just something for "popular education". Therefore, in "New Youth," Lu Xun, Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, these people not known as poets, also had works appearing. In Lu Xun's words, it was "because the poetry scene was lonely at that time, so I was beating the side drum" (Preface to Outside Collection). Under these circumstances, the youths awakened by the May Fourth Movement, unable to contain the surge of enthusiasm, many people also shouted out their voices. Mr. Zhu began to write poetry on February 29, 1919 (according to "Snow Morning"), which was the eve of the May Fourth Movement. Although the early new poetry indicated that it should rely on "the natural rhythm of tone," most of it did not break away from the influence of old poetry, but Mr. Zhu's poetry broke away from the shackles of old poetry more, taking new poetry a step forward. He was one of the early members of the Literary Research Association. The "Poetry" monthly magazine published in 1922 was the earliest poetry magazine that appeared since the May Fourth Movement, and it was regarded as a regular publication of the Literary Research Association. Mr. Zhu said, "This was run by Liu Yanling, Yu Pingbo, Sheng Tao, and me." (New Literature System Poetry Collection: Selected Poetry Notes). He wrote many poems on it. Mr. Mao Dun once said: The creative attitude of the writers of the Literary Research Association was generally that "literature should reflect social phenomena, express and discuss some general issues related to life" (Introduction to New Literature System Novel Collection One). In the attitude of facing reality and life, Mr. Zhu's poems also expressed this spirit without exception. The poetry collection "Snow Morning," one of the Literary Research Association series, had eight authors, and Mr. Zhu was the first. His long poem "Destruction," written in 1922, was a masterpiece that surpassed the level of the time in terms of both artistic conception and technique since the May Fourth Movement. The last paragraph says:
	From now on, I will no longer look up at the blue sky,
	No longer look down at the white water,
	Only carefully watching my pair of feet;
	I want to step on the soil step by step,
	Leaving deep footprints!
	Although these traces are extremely subtle,
	And will inevitably be erased,
	Although this slow walk
	Does not match the long and endless journey,
	But now the ordinary and small me,
	Only sees clear footsteps one by one,
	And has great joy—those far, far away
	Can no longer, and do not want to pay attention to them.
	Don't delay,
	Walk! Walk! Walk!
    The poem writes about how young people, after the climax of the May Fourth Movement, broke away from the "entanglement of temptation" and "restored an ordinary me". Generally speaking, for young intellectuals who were awakened by the May Fourth Movement but failed to combine with the revolutionary mainstream, suffering and wandering were common phenomena; some were decadent and suffering, some were hopeless and fanciful, but he took a positive attitude towards life, "wanting to step on the soil step by step and leave deep footprints". It was this spirit of realism that finally prompted him to move towards the people. After the poem was published, Mr. Yu Pingbo immediately wrote an article "Reading Destruction," praising it highly. In 1924, his collection "Traces" was published, which had a great influence on readers. Mr. Zheng Zhenduo said, "Zhu Ziqing's traces far exceed any of the best poems in the Collection of Attempts. The depth of skill is by no means a work of attempt, but written with all the effort." (Introduction to New Literature System Literary Controversy Collection).
    But after "Traces," he rarely wrote poetry. The preface to "Back View" says:
    I am a small soldier in a great era, an ordinary person. Needless to say, my talent is weak, so I have never been able to write anything good. I have written poetry, novels, and essays. Before the age of twenty-five, I liked to write poetry; in recent years, my poetic feelings have dried up, and I have stopped writing for a long time. The year before last, a friend read "War," which I wrote occasionally, and said that I could not write lyric poems, only epic poems; this actually meant that I could not write poetry. I myself also felt somewhat like this, and became even more lazy.
    Mr. Zhu was a person who had never interrupted his writing life for thirty years, so diligent and serious, and he wrote a lot of essays, so saying "lazy" is a pretext; "poetic feelings dried up" is true. This is not that he had no interest in poetry, he continued to write poetry reviews, selected poetry collections for the New Literature System, wrote two "New Poetry Talks" in 1936 ("Literature" New Poetry Special Issue), and wrote several more during the Anti-Japanese War, forming a book "New Poetry Talks," and even promoted recitation poetry before his death. But since teaching at Tsinghua University in 1925, his life was stereotyped, and his enthusiasm also diminished, and it was more convenient to write about the feelings and thoughts of daily life in essays; the high-pitched emotions of the May Fourth period subsided, and there were fewer poems. After Mr. Wen Yiduo was killed, he could not suppress the flame of anger, picked up the pen that he had not written poetry with for a long time, and wrote the sincere and painful "Elegy". The power of the people stimulated the revival of his poetic feelings. He was a poet, and the early impression he gave people was also that of a poet. Mr. Guo Moruo, in "Ten Years of Creation" published in 1932, still called him the poet Zhu Ziqing of the Literary Research Association, even though he had not written poetry for a long time at that time.
    II
    Mr. Lu Xun once said:
    At the time of the May Fourth Movement, ... the success of prose sketches was almost above novels, dramas, and poetry. Among these, there is naturally struggle and combat, but because it often takes the British essay as a model, it also has a bit of humor and grace; the writing method is also beautiful and meticulous, which is to demonstrate against the old literature, to show that the vernacular literature can also do what the old literature thinks it is good at. The road ahead was originally clearly more distinct struggle and combat, because this originally sprouted from the "Literary Revolution" to the "Ideological Revolution." (Southern Accent Northern Tone Collection: The Crisis of Sketches)
    Mr. Zhu's early essays, such as "Back View," "Moonlight over the Lotus Pond," "The Qinhuai River under the Lantern Light," etc., were all called representative works of early essays. These are exactly the beautiful and meticulous writing methods that Mr. Lu Xun spoke of, fulfilling the task of demonstrating against the old literature. Since stopping writing poetry, he wrote more essays. Books such as "You and Me," "European Travel Notes," and "London Notes" were all written before the Anti-Japanese War. Mr. Zhu's life and occupation made it difficult for him to walk at the forefront of the times, and he was unwilling to write humorous sketches about trivial matters around him, so his state of mind was very bitter. In 1931, he wrote:
    Ten years ago, I wrote poetry; later I stopped writing poetry and wrote essays; after entering middle age, I could not write essays much either—now it is that there is nothing to say that is even more "scattered" than essays! Many people suffer from having something to say but not being able to say it, and many other people suffer from having nowhere to say it; their suffering is still in the words, but my suffering of having nothing to say is outside the words. I feel like I am a withered leaf, a piece of waste paper, in this great era.
    But why would I still write poetry and prose?——Even if they are all nonsense. This is because of the times! Ten years ago was the period of the May Fourth Movement, and the vigorous spirit of the crowd was pressing on me, a young student; so I followed in the footsteps of others and talked about nature and life. But these were just categories. I am a lazy person, and to be honest, I have not suffered any terrible adversity; I have neither thought deeply nor experienced it myself, so the categories are ultimately just categories, and besides, they are just cheap, new bottles filled with old wine of sentimentality. At that time, sesame and soybean-sized things were written out solemnly, but now when I look at them, I can only smile wryly.
    But recently, in Dai Yi's translation of the materialist view of literature, I saw that the French proverb "nothing to say" is synonymous with "all is well". Alas, what a damaging sentence, for me, for my era! (Excerpt from "You and Me": On Having Nothing to Say)
    We have quoted so much without fear of trouble, because this best expresses his state of mind in the ten years before the Anti-Japanese War. The preface to "European Travel Notes" says: "The articles in the book mainly describe scenery, and rarely mention my own place. This is intentionally avoided: one is that I am an amateur, why bother to make high-sounding remarks; and the other is that in this era, it is ultimately meaningless to talk about trivial matters around me." The preface to "London Notes" also says: "When writing these notes, I still held the attitude of writing "European Travel Notes," which is to avoid the appearance of "I". There are still no trivial matters around me, and there is still no romantic exotic feeling. ... I can only honestly write what I see and hear, like a news report." Therefore, when publications such as "The Analects" and "Human World" advocated humorous sketches, he did not participate; and when the prose publication "Taibai," supported by Lu Xun and others, was published, he was one of the editorial board members. Later, when he narrated this period of history, he said: "Intellectuals pay attention to the interest of life, pay attention to personal likes and dislikes, pay attention to trivial matters around them, and the 'expressing aspirations' school appeared in the literary world, which is actually a cynical school. Furthermore, they pay attention to humor, humor for the sake of humor, meaningless humor. Humor replaces seriousness, and the literary world is empty." (Standards and Measures: On Seriousness). He has always been very serious about life.
    This period of works pays great attention to the refinement of writing, and all the words used are colloquial, extracting effective expressions from the colloquial; occasionally there are some classical Chinese components, but they also have the flavor of colloquial when read. After reading, one feels that the author's attitude is kind and sincere, with a graceful style that is moving. The preface to "European Travel Notes" says: "I also put some effort into the writing when describing: I feel that the arrangement of 'is' sentences, 'have' sentences, and 'at' sentences is the most difficult. To show the relationship between scenery, I can't do without these three sentence patterns, but if I always use this set, who can bear it! Besides, these three sentences all show static states, which is also quite dull." The avoidance of "I" sentences in "London Notes" can all show his intentions. He said that the intention was to write for middle school students, which we can also see, he pays attention to the expressive methods of writing, but he is different from some writers who specialize in playing with techniques in writing. He uses colloquial language, and it is refined and lively colloquial language, and a sincere attitude also runs through the writing, saying that it is only for middle school students is just a modest remark, for people who need a little language training and writing cultivation, these words are still worthy of being a model today. Mr. Ye Shengtao said: "Now if universities offer courses in modern national literature, or if someone compiles a history of modern national literature, when it comes to the perfection of the style and the complete writing of spoken language, Mr. Zhu should be mentioned first." ("Middle School Student" No. 203: Mr. Zhu Peixian)
    During the Anti-Japanese War, he wrote a book of essays "Language Shadow," but because the bookstore pressed it down and did not print it, it is now compiled in the complete collection. It is divided into two collections, "Language Shadow Collection" discusses the meaning of language; "Life Corner Collection" discusses fragments of life. The writing is more refined. He himself said: "Mr. Ye Shengtao once wrote to me, saying that these articles are not easy for young people to understand. Mr. Wen Yiduo also told me that those articles discussing fragments of life have a writing style somewhat like poetry. I did put a lot of effort into saving words when I wrote this kind of short essay." (Preface to "Standards and Measures") This book is not only more obscure in writing, but the content is also the emotions of a steady middle-aged person; on the contrary, "New Poetry Talks" and "Language Odds and Ends" (critical writing), which were also written during the Anti-Japanese War, are more beautiful and smooth in writing.
    After the victory, he wrote a lot of writing, mainly collected in the two books "Standards and Measures" and "On Popular Appreciation". Because his thinking has changed, what he talks about is also realistic problems. At this time, the articles are biased towards reasoning, and although the sentiment is not as good as in his early years, the thinking is firm, targeted at reality, and the writing is meticulous and appropriate, and the impact is greater than could be compared to his early years. He calls it miscellaneous essays, which shows the direction of his own interest. Because of many years of studying ancient history, he often analyzes realistic problems from the development of history, but it is娓娓动听, so that people know that the future development is also "from its origin" and "inevitable", and not at all pedantic. He said that he speaks from a "modern standpoint"; "The so-called modern standpoint, according to my understanding, can be said to be the standpoint of 'popular appreciation', or it can be said to be the standpoint that favors ordinary people or ordinary people, or it can be said to be close to the standpoint of the people." (Preface to On Popular Appreciation) During this period, he understood the power of writing and wrote quickly and a lot, he said: "Since the return, things have been busy, and my mood has also changed, I have to write more, write faster, more casually, and easier to understand." He also said: "After this year of training, my pen may have been released a bit. Not long ago, a young man said to me that he felt that my writing was still concise, but not difficult to understand. The training is probably somewhat effective." (Preface to "Standards and Measures") He constantly learns, treats writing as a work task to work hard; and also thinks about the readers everywhere, requires the writing to be more popular, and somewhat changes the habit of always valuing writing modification; these are all the results of him getting closer to the people.
    Starting from the May Fourth Movement, Mr. Zhu was a writer who wrote for thirty years, and the "Complete Works" collected reached two million words, and the results of his efforts are very considerable. From the beginning of his writing, he was facing life squarely; continuous learning and hard work were his consistent attitudes. Although there was a period of time when he was slightly stagnant in his thinking, he did not go down the wrong path. A truly "for life" writer finally walked towards the road of "for the people". After many years of suffering and groping, in his later years, Mr. Zhu finally bravely approached the people; at the same time, the people also gave him great strength. In the raging anti-American and pro-Japanese movement, regardless of the persecution of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and regardless of the weakness of his own sick body, he resolutely joined the ranks of revolutionary youth, working enthusiastically until the day he died of overwork. If it were not for living under the dark and brutal rule of the Kuomintang, experiencing a long and arduous life of displacement, Mr. Zhu would definitely be able to live to this day and witness the liberation of the people of the motherland. If so, what a precious contribution he would have made on China's cultural front!

### 朱自清先生的诗和散文

　　朱自清先生的诗和散文
　　王瑶
    一
    朱自清先生在大学里学的是哲学，我们在《新潮》上还可以看见他写的关于心理学的文章。五四的浪潮促使他走上了创作的路，他开始写诗。诗是“文学革命”最早结有果实的部门，虽然不像小说那样一开始就有了丰硕的收获。这在当时是含有一点战斗意义的。因为小说还有水浒红楼等旧小说可以借镜；而韵文又是旧文学自以为瑰宝的。文学革命一定要在诗的国土攫有权力，那才算是成功，才不只是“通俗教育”的东西。因此在《新青年》上，鲁迅、李大钊、陈独秀，这些不以诗人闻名的人，也都有作品出现。用鲁迅的话说，是“因为那时诗坛寂寞，所以打打边鼓”（集外集序言）在这种情形下，为五四浪潮觉醒了的青年们，捺不住热情的冲涌，许多人也都纷纷地喊出了他们的声音。朱先生开始写诗是一九一九年二月二十九日（据《雪朝》），正是五四的前夜。初期的新诗，虽然标示着要靠“语气的自然节奏”，但大都没有脱离旧诗词的影响，但朱先生的诗更多地摆脱了旧诗词的束缚，使新诗向前跨了一步。他是文学研究会的早期会员之一。一九二二年出版的《诗》月刊，是五四以来最早出现的诗刊，算作文学研究会的定期刊物。朱先生说，“这是刘延陵、俞平伯、圣陶、和我几个人办的。”（新文学大系诗集：选诗杂记）在上面他写了好些诗。茅盾先生曾说：文学研究会作家的创作态度是一般地以为“文学应该反映社会的现象，表现并且讨论一些有关人生一般的问题”（新文学大系小说一集导言）。在正视现实和面向人生的态度上，朱先生的诗也毫不例外地表现了这种精神。文学研究会丛书之一的诗合集《雪朝》，作者八人，朱先生是第一位。他的长诗《毁灭》写在一九二二年，是五四以来无论在意境上和技巧上都超过了当时水平的力作。末段说：
    从此我不再仰眼看青天，
    不再低头看白水，
    只谨慎着我双双的脚步；
    我要一步步踏在泥土上，
    打上深深的脚印！
    虽然这些印迹是极微细的，
    且必将磨灭的，
    虽然这迟迟的行步
    不称那迢迢无尽的程途，
    但现在平常而渺小的我，
    只看到一个个分明的脚步，
    便有十分的欣悦——那些远远远远的
    是再不能，也不想理会的了。
    别耽搁吧，
    走！走！走！
    诗中写出了五四高潮过去后青年怎样摆脱了“诱惑的纠缠”，“还原了一个平平常常的我”。就当时一般为五四觉醒了而未能和革命主流相结合的知识青年说，苦闷仿徨是普遍的现象；有的颓废苦闷，有的绝望空想，但他却以正视人生的态度，“要一步步踏在泥土上，打上深深的脚印”。就是这种现实主义的精神，终于促使他走向了人民。这诗发表后，俞平伯先生即有《读毁灭》一文，备加称誉。一九二四年他的集子《踪迹》出版，在读者中有过很大的影响。郑振铎先生说：“朱自清的踪迹是远远的超过尝试集里的任何最好的一首。功力的深厚，已绝不是尝试之作，而是用了全力来写着的。”（新文学大系文学论争集导言）
    但《踪迹》以后他就很少写诗了。《背影》序说：
    我是大时代中一名小卒，是个平凡不过的人。才力的单薄是不用说的，所以一向写不出什么好东西。我写过诗，写过小说，写过散文。二十五岁以前，喜欢写诗；近几年诗情枯竭，搁笔已久。前年一个朋友看了我偶然写下的《战争》，说我不能做抒情诗，只能做史诗；这其实就是说我不能做诗。我自己也有些觉得如此，便越发懒怠起来。
    朱先生是三十年来没有中断过写作生活的人，那样勤恳认真，写的散文也不少，说“懒怠”是托词；“诗情枯竭”倒是真的。这也不是他对诗已经没有兴趣，他还不断写诗的评论，为新文学大系选诗集，一九三六年写过《新诗杂话》两篇（《文学》新诗专号），抗战期中又写了若干篇，成《新诗杂话》一册，直到死前还在提倡朗诵诗。但自一九二五年到清华教书以来，生活定型了，热情也减退了些，日常生活的感触和思想都是用散文写更比较方便；五四期的高亢情绪潜伏下去，诗就少了。到闻一多先生遇难后，他又压不住愤怒的火焰，拾起久不写诗的笔，写下了诚挚沉痛的《悼诗》。人民的力量激发了他的诗情的复苏。他是诗人，早期给人的印象也是诗人。郭沫若先生在一九三二年出版的《创造十年》中，还称他为文学研究会的诗人朱自清，那时他已久不写诗了。
    二
    鲁迅先生曾说：
    到五四运动的时候，………散文小品的成功，几乎在小说戏曲和诗歌之上。这之中，自然含着挣扎和战斗，但因为常常取法于英国的随笔（essay），所以也带一点幽默和雍容；写法也有漂亮和缜密的，这是为了对于旧文学的示威，在表示旧文学之自以为特长者，白话文学也并非做不到。以后的路，本来明明是更分明的挣扎和战斗，因为这原是萌芽于“文学革命”以至“思想革命”的。（南腔北调集：小品文的危机）
    朱先生早期的散文，如《背影》，《荷塘月色》，《桨声灯影里的秦淮河》等，都是被称作早期散文里的代表作的。这些正是像鲁迅先生说的漂亮缜密的写法，尽了对旧文学示威的任务的。自从停止写诗以后，散文就写得更多。像《你我》，《欧游杂记》，《伦敦杂记》各书，都是抗战前写的。朱先生的生活和职业都使他很难走在时代的前面，而他又不甘写一些身边琐事的幽默小品，心境是很苦闷的。一九三一年他写道：
    十年前我写过诗；后来不写诗了，写散文；入中年以后，散文也不大写得出了——现在是，比散文还要“散”的无话可说！许多人苦于有话说不出，另有许多人苦于有话无处说；他们的苦还在话中，我这无话可说的苦却在话外。我觉得自己是一张枯叶，一张烂纸，在这个大时代里。
    但是为什么还会写出诗文呢？——虽然都是些废话。这是时代为之！十年前正是五四运动的时期，大伙儿蓬蓬勃勃的朝气，紧逼着我这个年轻的学生；于是乎跟着人家的脚印，也说说什么自然，什么人生。但这只是些范畴而已。我是个懒人，平心而论，又不曾遭过怎样了不得的逆境；既不深思力索，又未亲自体验，范畴终于只是范畴，此外也只是廉价的，新瓶里装旧酒的感伤。当时芝麻黄豆大的事，都不惜郑重地写出来，现在看看，苦笑而已。
    但近来在戴译唯物史观的文学论里看到，法国俗语“无话可说”竟与“一切皆好”同意。呜呼，这是多么损的一句话，对于我，对于我的时代！（摘自《你我》：论无话可说）
    我们不惮烦地引了这么许多，因为这最可表示他在抗战前十年间的心境。《欧游杂记》序说：“书中各篇以记述景物为主，极少说到自己的地方。这是有意避免的：一则自己外行，何必放言高论；二则这个时代，身边琐事说来到底无谓。”《伦敦杂记》序也说：“写这些篇杂记时，我还是抱着写《欧游杂记》的态度，就是避免“我”的出现。身边琐事还是没有，浪漫的异域感也还是没有。……只能老老实实写出所见所闻，像新闻的报道一样。”因此当《论语》《人间世》等刊物提倡幽默小品的时候，他没有参加；而为鲁迅先生等所支持的散文刊物《太白》出版时，他是编辑委员之一。以后他叙述这一段历史的时候，曾说：“知识分子讲究生活的趣味，讲究个人的好恶，讲究身边琐事，文坛上就出现了‘言志派’，其实是玩世派。更进一步讲究幽默，为幽默而幽默，无意义的幽默。幽默代替了严肃，文坛上一片空虚。”（标准与尺度：论严肃）。他对人生向来是很严肃的。
    这一期的作品很注意于文字的洗炼，所用全是口语，从口语中提取有效的表现方式；偶有一些文言成分，念起来也有口语的韵味。读后觉得作者态度亲切诚挚，有一种娓娓动人的风采。《欧游杂记》序说：“记述时可也费了一些心在文字上：觉得‘是’字句，‘有’字句，‘在’字句安排最难。显示景物间的关系，短不了这三样句法，可是老用这一套，谁耐烦！再说这三种句子都显示静态，也够沈闷的。”《伦敦杂记》的避免“我”字句，都可以看出他的用心。他说用意是写给中学生看的，这我们也看得出，他注意于文字的表现方式，但与一些在文字上专门玩弄技巧的作家不同。他用的是口语，而且是提炼了的活的口语，诚挚的态度又流贯在文字间，说专给中学生看只是谦词，对于需要一点语文训练和写作修养的人，这些文字在今天也还够得上是典范。叶圣陶先生说：“现在大学里如果开现代本国文学的课程，或者有人编现代本国文学史，论到文体的完美，文字的全写口语，朱先生该是首先被提及的。”（《中学生》二○三号：朱佩弦先生）
    抗战期间写过一本散文《语文影》，因为书店压着没有印出来，现在编在全集里。中分两辑，《语文影之辑》是讨论语文的意义的；《人生一角之辑》是讨论生活片段的。文字更精炼了。他自己说：“叶圣陶先生曾经写信给我，说这些文章青年人不容易看懂。闻一多先生也和我说过那些讨论生活片段的文章，作法有些像诗。我那时写这种短文，的确很用心在节省字句上。”（《标准与尺度》自序）这书不只文字比较隐晦一些，内容也是稳健的中年人的情感；反不如也是写于抗战期中的《新诗杂话》和《语文零拾》（批评性质的文字）的文字优美流畅。
    胜利以后他写的文字很多，主要收在《标准与尺度》和《论雅俗共赏》两书里。因为思想有了变化，所谈的也都是现实的问题。这时的文章偏于说理，情致虽然不如早年，但思想坚定，针对现实，文字又周密妥贴，影响之大，非早年所可比拟。他自称为杂文，可以看出他自己意趣的归向。因了多年研究古代历史的关系，他分析现实问题也常常从历史的发展来说明，但娓娓动听，使人知道今后的发展也是“其来有自”和“势所必至”的，一点也不学究气。他说他讲话是“现代的立场”；“所谓现代的立场，按我的了解，可以说就是‘雅俗共赏’的立场，也可以说是偏重俗人或常人的立场，也可以说是近于人民的立场。”（论雅俗共赏序）这时期他了解了文章的力量，写得很快很多，他说：“复员以来，事情忙了，心情也娈了，我得多写些，写得快些，随便些，容易懂些。”又说：“经过这一年来的训练，我的笔也许放开了些。不久以前一位青年向我说，他觉得我的文字还是简省字句，不过不难懂。训练大概是有些效验的。”（《标准与尺度》自序）他不断学习，把写作当作工作任务来努力；又处处为读者着想，要求文字能更普及，多少改掉了一些向来重视文字修饰的习惯；这都是他靠近人民的结果。
    从五四开始，朱先生是写作了三十年的作家，《全集》所收，达两百万言，努力的成绩很可观。从他写作的开始起，就是正视人生的；不断的学习，努力的工作，是他一贯的态度。中间虽有一段时间在思想上略嫌停滞，但并没有走错了路。一个真正“为人生”的作家最后走向了“为人民”的道路。经过了多年的苦闷和摸索，到他的晚年，朱先生终于勇敢地靠近了人民；同时人民也给了他很大的力量。在如火如荼的反美扶日运动中，他不顾国民党反动派的迫害，不顾自己病体的衰弱，毅然地参加在革命的青年人的行列里，热情地工作，直到他积劳成疾辞世的一天。要不是生活在黑暗残暴的国民党统治之下，经历着长久的颠沛艰苦的岁月，朱先生是一定能活到现在，亲见祖国人民的解放的。假若这样，他在中国的文化战线上将有何等珍贵的贡献啊！
