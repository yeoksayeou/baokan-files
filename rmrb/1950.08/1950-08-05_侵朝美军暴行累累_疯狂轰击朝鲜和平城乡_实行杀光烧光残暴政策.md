Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th—The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Democratic Republic announced in a war report on the evening of the 2nd that People's Army units on all fronts are breaking through the desperate resistance of the American army and the Li Seung-man puppet army and continuing their offensive. American air force squadrons and naval fleets have been blindly bombing and shelling cities and villages north and south of the 38th parallel for days, destroying many cultural facilities such as schools, hospitals, and theaters, as well as civilian houses, and massacring peaceful residents and women who are working.

On August 1st, an enemy destroyer that attacked the western part of Ongjin Peninsula, Baengnyeong Island, fired more than 300 shells at the residential area near the island, causing serious damage to the lives and property of residents. The People's Army coastal artillery units immediately counterattacked, resulting in the enemy destroyer being hit by more than 20 shells, losing its balance, and fleeing while emitting smoke.

On August 1st, more than 50 enemy aircraft, including B-29 bombers, barbarously bombed residential areas near Hungnam City, causing the destruction of four hospitals and many schools, cultural facilities, and residences. Residents suffered heavy casualties.

The General Headquarters of the People's Army announced in a war report on the evening of the 1st that the People's Army shot down three American aircraft on July 31st.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th—The American aggressors are implementing a brutal policy of kill all, burn all in the South Korean war zone.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 2nd: The American authorities have decided to create so-called "safe zones" in Korea, "All Koreans must withdraw from these safe zones, and anyone found in this area will be treated as an enemy." It is claimed that American "commanders have ordered their soldiers to shoot anyone they see."

The atrocity of burning peaceful Korean towns and villages is being intensified. According to a Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch from Korea on the 2nd: When the US First Cavalry Division recently withdrew from Geochang, it set the city on fire. Prior to this, the American army had continuously burned down a large number of peaceful towns and villages near the front line and villages in areas where guerrillas were active, and instructed the Li Seung-man clique to massacre large numbers of patriotic people.
