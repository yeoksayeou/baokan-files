　　(Nanjing News) According to the Xin Hua Daily, in order to implement the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests and developing production, state-owned specialized companies in Nanjing actively supported private industry and commerce through various means, helping some manufacturers solve the difficulties in supply, production, and sales. However, some private manufacturers did not have a sufficient understanding of the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests and did not sincerely cooperate with state-owned companies. Instead, they engaged in speculation and sought illegal profits in areas such as commissioned processing, acquisition, and sales on commission. This not only caused considerable losses to the people's property but also had a certain impact on the normal public-private relationship.
    In terms of processing, individual manufacturers exaggerated the amount of loss and damage to deceive state-owned companies. For example, Dingsheng Rice Mill, when processing 70,000 jin of rough rice for the grain company, falsely reported that 7,000 jin were moldy and rotten when the actual amount was only 300 jin. Some manufacturers played a double-dealing trick, delivering one type of finished product to the state-owned company while delivering another type to customers. For example, when Xiaguan Shunchang Rice Mill processed 92 rice for the grain company, the rice sample delivered was not far from the standard, but when customers received a bill of lading from the grain company and went to the mill to collect the rice, the rice they received only met the standard of 97 rice. In addition, some unscrupulous manufacturers privately charged excessive warehouse fees or other unreasonable fees, causing great dissatisfaction to customers who came to collect the rice. Due to these manufacturers' lack of credibility and speculation, the grain company's reputation and sales were affected to a certain extent.
    In terms of acquisition, manufacturers only hoped to increase profits, but some of them did not start by reducing unreasonable institutions and saving unnecessary expenses, but only planned to cut corners and reduce materials. For example, in the goods received by the department store, it was found that the quality of a small number of finished products had been reduced. Some manufacturers' products experienced a large increase in sales and a significant increase in output after being acquired, but they did not make further improvements in quality. For example, a batch of products delivered by the Capital Match Factory to the department store was found to have problems such as phosphorus shedding and broken stems.
    In terms of sales on commission, because the number of consignment stores was large, it was not possible to check and supervise them at any time, so there were more problems. There are roughly three types: First, late payment: For example, some consignment stores of the grain company and native products company failed to pay on time; Second, underpayment: When the grain company conducted random checks on consignment stores, it often found shortages of grain in stock and discrepancies between goods and accounts. Some cunning consignment stores even misappropriated cash from grain sales to buy and sell other goods for profit; Third, individual consignment stores reduced the quality and privately raised prices for sale.
    This kind of bad phenomenon that seriously affects the normal relationship between public and private interests violates the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests and developing production, and must be corrected.

　　违反公私兼顾发展生产原则
    南京部分厂商图谋非法利润
    加工代销投机取巧收购商品偷工减料
    【南京讯】据新华日报消息：宁市各国营专业公司为贯彻公私兼顾、发展生产的政策，曾通过各种方式，积极扶助私营工商业，帮助部分厂商解决了供、产、销三方面的困难；但有一些私营厂商却对公私兼顾的原则认识不够，没有诚心诚意地与国营公司合作，反在委托加工、收购、委托代销等方面投机取巧，非法牟利。这不仅使人民财产遭受了相当的损失，而且也使正常的公私关系受了一定的影响。
    在加工方面，个别厂商扩大损耗数字，欺蒙国营公司，如鼎盛米厂为粮食公司加工七万斤糙米，即谎报有七千斤霉烂，实际上霉烂的只有三百斤。有的厂商玩着两面欺骗的把戏，交与国营公司的是一种成品，交与顾客的则是另外一种成品。如下关顺昌米厂为粮食公司加工九二米，交来的米样与标准相差不远，但当顾客领到粮食公司提单到该厂提米时，领得的米却只有九七米的标准。除此以外，更有不法厂商私自收取超额出仓费，或其他一些不合理的费用，使前往提米的顾客感到极大的不满。由于这些厂商不顾信用、投机取巧，使粮食公司的信誉和销路都受到一定的影响。
    在收购方面，厂商们只希望增加利润，但一部分厂商却没有从裁减不合理的机构，节省不必要的开支着手，单只在偷工减料上打算盘。如百货公司在收进的货物中，即发现有少数成品质量降低的现象。有的厂商产品经收购后，销路大增，产量大大提高，但却没有在质量上作更进一步的改进。如首都火柴厂交给百货公司的一批出品中，即发现有部分脱磷、断梗等现象。
    在代销方面，因代销店数目较多，不能随时检查督促，因此问题也较多。大致约有如下三种：一、迟交款：如粮食公司、土产公司部分代销店，即有不按时交款的情形；二、少交款：粮食公司在抽查代销店时，往往发现有存粮短少，货账不符的现象，甚至个别狡猾的代销店，竟挪用售粮现款买卖其他货物谋利；三、个别代销店降低品质，私抬价格出售。
    此种严重影响公私正常关系的不良现象，违反了公私兼顾发展生产的原则，必须注意纠正。
