Moon Jong-sang, who is studying at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music, wrote in a petition to General Kim Il-sung: "At this critical moment that decides the fate of the motherland, I believe that stopping my studies and directly joining the People's Army of the Republic to go to the front line to eliminate the enemy is the greatest glory. I am determined to fight to the end for the motherland and the people."
