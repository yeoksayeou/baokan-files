　　Gao Jianmin of the Agricultural Ministry's Water Conservancy Promotion Society is irresponsible in his work
    Comrade Sanjin from Qing County Sends Letter of Criticism
    Gao Jianmin of the Central People's Government's Agricultural Ministry's Water Conservancy Promotion Society, leading workers Wang Zhiyu and Zhang Haisen to Qing County, Hebei Province, to repair waterwheels for farmers, has been irresponsible in his work, causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

    Liu Rongquan's waterwheel in Baitukou Village, Qing County, had misaligned wheels of different sizes, making it heavy to pull and difficult to use. He requested Gao Jianmin to correct the wheels. However, Gao Jianmin said, "Misaligned wheels are not a problem, as long as it can draw water." With that, he went to repair other waterwheels. As soon as he left, Liu Rongquan's waterwheel broke down. At that time, Tian Peijie, a water conservancy cadre from Qing County, called the workers back to repair it. Gao Jianmin, finding it troublesome, said to the workers, "Don't take the whole waterwheel apart; just fix the flat wheel well enough." Despite the waterwheel owner's repeated requests to align the wheels properly, he was unwilling and only fixed it perfunctorily before leaving. As a result, the main shaft of this waterwheel broke again on June 29th.

    Wang Runsheng's waterwheel in Zhangzhuangzi Village, Qing County, had a spinning center shaft that couldn't draw water. When repairing it, Gao Jianmin only tightened the screws. The Qing County water conservancy cadre told him, "This repair won't work; it will break as soon as it's used." He did not accept the opinion, nor did he check for other problems before leaving. As a result, the waterwheel was not repaired properly either.

    Wang Xiquan's waterwheel in the same village had previously been broken, and Wang Xiquan had tried to repair it himself, barely making it usable, but it still had problems. When Gao Jianmin went to repair it, Wang Xiquan requested him to disassemble the waterwheel and then reassemble it so that he could learn and be able to repair it himself in the future if it broke down. Gao Jianmin impatiently said, "Your waterwheel isn't broken; why did you ask us to repair it? We are very busy and don't have time to take it apart for fun." Wang Xiquan repeatedly requested, "Please repair it for me this once. If I learn how, I won't bother you next time." Gao Jianmin then said to the workers, "Let's go quickly; don't talk to him here. Let's go! Let's go!" Waterwheel owner Wang Xiquan said disappointedly to Qing County water conservancy cadre Tian Peijie, "If they won't repair it, then they won't repair it!" Workers Wang Zhiyu and Zhang Haisen sympathized with Wang Xiquan and patiently explained things to him. However, Gao Jianmin insisted on taking the workers away.

    We believe that Gao Jianmin, representing the Central People's Government's Agricultural Ministry's Water Conservancy Promotion Society, has the task of repairing waterwheels and promoting water conservancy in the local area. However, he is irresponsible in his work and has a very poor attitude towards the masses, resulting in a very negative impact among the people. I suggest that the responsible comrades of the Central People's Government's Agricultural Ministry's Water Conservancy Promotion Society criticize and educate Comrade Gao for his serious lack of a mass perspective and irresponsible attitude towards the people. I also hope that Comrade Gao Jianmin can make a profound self-criticism and change his work style.

### 农业部水利推进社高建民工作不负责任  青县三金同志来信提出批评

　　农业部水利推进社高建民工作不负责任
    青县三金同志来信提出批评编辑同志：
    中央人民政府农业部水利推进社高建民，带领工人王志雨、张海森到河北省青县给农民修理水车，工作不负责任，引起群众不满。
    青县白渡口村刘荣全的水车，大小轮子不正，拉着很重，又不好使。要求高建民把轮子修正。但高建民说：“轮子不正不算毛病，拉得上水来就行。”他说着，就修理别的水车去了。他刚走，刘荣全的水车就坏了。当时青县水利干部田培杰，又把工人叫回来修理。高建民嫌麻烦就对工人说：“别把水车全卸开了，凑合着把平轮修理上就行。”水车户再三要求他将轮子按正，他还是不愿意，只是马马虎虎地修一下就走了。结果，这辆水车的大轴在六月二十九日又坏了。
    青县张庄子村王润生的水车，中轴自转，带不上水来。高建民修理时只给紧了一下螺丝。青县水利干部对他说：“这样修理不行，一使就要坏。”他不接受意见，也不检查还有什么毛病，就走了。结果水车也未修理好。
    该村王锡全的水车以前曾经坏过，王锡全曾自己研究着修理了一下，勉强能用，但还有毛病。高建民去修理时，王锡全便要求他把水车给卸开后再上好，让他能学习一下，以后坏了自己便能修理。高建民不耐烦地说：“你这水车没有坏，为什么请我们来修理？我们很忙，那有时间给你拆着玩。”王锡全又再三要求说：“请你们给修理一次吧。我看会了，下次就不麻烦你们了。”高建民就向工人同志说：“你们快走，别在这里和他说话。快走！快走！”车户王锡全失望地对青县水利干部田培杰说：“人家不给修理，就不修理吧！”王志雨、张海森二位工人很同情王锡全，便耐心地向他解释。但是高建民却硬把工人叫走了。
    我们认为：高建民代表中央人民政府农业部水利推进社到地方上来，负着修理水车、开展水利事业的任务，但工作不负责任，并且对群众态度很不好，以致在群众中造成很不好的影响。我建议中央人民政府农业部水利推进社负责同志，对高同志这种严重的缺乏群众观点和对人民不负责的作风予以批评教育。并且希望高建民同志能作深刻检讨，转变工作作风。
