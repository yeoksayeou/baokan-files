　　Examining Our Bureaucratic Work Style
　　Hebei Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department
    Editor's Note: This examination by the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee is beneficial to future work. However, this examination still has shortcomings. It does not fully point out the main tendency of the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee to take over and replace the work of the government. Because the practice of taking over and replacing will not only limit the sense of responsibility and creativity of government staff, but also foster certain erroneous tendencies in the work of the Party committee. However, judging from this examination, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee did not explicitly criticize the fundamental errors of this working method when pointing out the tendency of subjectivism. In fact, what is most prominently manifested in the examination of the tendency of subjectivism and the tendency of formalism (work is arranged but not inspected) is the serious taking over and replacement of government work or the work of other departments. This can be seen in the work of assessing output, arranging well drilling, distributing cotton seeds, and technical training. This deviation of blurring the lines between the Party and the government should also continue to be addressed and overcome by Party committees in other regions.
    Since the adjustment of administrative divisions last August, thanks to the active efforts of the majority of cadres, various tasks in our region have generally implemented policies and completed the tasks assigned by higher authorities. However, judging from the leadership style and working methods of the Prefectural Committee, there are indeed many problems. Among them, the bureaucratic work style of being divorced from the masses is the most serious and prominent. As a result, it has fostered the bureaucratic and coercive style of lower-level organs and cadres. After preliminary examination, it was found that our bureaucracy is mainly manifested in the following aspects:
    (1) Subjectivism, failing to act according to specific circumstances. Mainly, we are not good at conducting meticulous investigation and research, and only have a conceptual understanding of the basic situation in our region. Therefore, whenever a work task arrives, we often fail to analyze objective and subjective conditions, and even when we know there are problems, we still rely on enthusiasm to realize subjective wishes. There is a great deal of blindness in arranging work and assigning tasks. For example, when assessing and setting production targets this spring, seeing that the average yield required by the provincial government for our region was much higher than that of neighboring regions, we developed a narrow departmentalist mindset and felt that the provincial government's demands on our region were too high. But we were unclear about what the actual yield of this region should be. Later, when assessing and setting production targets, we did not conduct typical investigations or have general standards for calculation, but rather estimated the highs and lows from the comparison of output figures reported by various counties. We were also vague about the geology, soil, and general operating conditions of various places. Therefore, the figures were changed three times in a very short period after the task was assigned. The counties unanimously proposed: "The special district should come up with standards, so as not to change back and forth, causing the lower levels to waste their efforts!" In addition, the provincial leading organ originally instructed that the assessment of output should be carried out with a focus, but we did not consider the subjective strength and carried it out universally without a focus. The higher authorities arranged for the election work of the three-level people's representative conference one month before the busy farming season. At that time, the Prefectural Committee estimated that it would be difficult to complete these tasks due to the short time and heavy workload, and planned to raise objections to the provincial leading organ. But we felt that this was a unified decision of the provincial leading organ and would not be changed; at the same time, we subjectively believed that if we finished it quickly now, we could concentrate our efforts on leading production later. So we arranged it as it was. As a result, not only was the assessment of output and the three-level election work not done well, but the preparations for spring plowing were also affected. For example, when arranging well drilling work, we did not consider the well drilling conditions in various regions and the economic strength of the masses; we did not calculate whether using the same amount of grain loans mainly for repairing old wells would be more beneficial to restoring production, but subjectively determined the task of drilling new wells. And we assigned one hundred and ten wells to Jingxing, which had no well drilling conditions, and only four were completed as a result.
    (2) Lack of strict and regular inspection work. In the early spring cotton planting work, the leading cadres of the Prefectural Committee were satisfied with the figure of more than six million kilograms of cotton seeds prepared, and satisfied with the arrangements made by the supply and marketing cooperatives for selling, exchanging, and lending cotton seeds, but failed to conduct in-depth inspections. In fact, only more than 300,000 kilograms of cotton seeds were distributed to the masses by the end of March, and the rest were lent out in a rush when the masses rushed to plant cotton after the rain. Some counties had difficulties in the work of repaying loans with wheat this summer because the procedures were unclear. During the loaning process, due to insufficient inspection and the failure to make widespread propaganda for cotton planting, some farmers lent cotton seeds and resold them, used them for oil extraction, or exchanged them for fertilizer. At the same time, the leaders of the Prefectural Committee subjectively believed that the cotton seeds were good and did not earnestly supervise the germination test. In fact, a small part of the cotton seeds were moldy due to improper storage, or a mixture of good and bad. The supply and marketing cooperative of the Third District of Shulu even deliberately mixed unusable cotton seeds with good seeds and lent them to farmers. As a result, in some areas, cotton fields were unevenly sprouted and had to be replanted. The same is true for the treatment of cotton aphids. We were satisfied with the technical training that had been carried out, and lacked level-by-level inspection. The Prefectural Committee also seized a few good examples and reported to the Provincial Committee that the technical guidance work was done well. But it was not until cotton aphids became widespread that it was discovered that technical training was still mostly staying with village cadres and had not penetrated into the masses, so most of the masses still did not know the treatment method; some used bad methods such as brine, kerosene spray, and hot soil burial, which resulted in the death of many cotton seedlings. There was also insufficient preparation of aphid control supplies. Some counties (such as Yuanshi) took action and found that there was not enough tobacco, so they temporarily ordered the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase 100,000 kilograms of tobacco. However, because the purchase was late, the aphids decreased after the rain, and the tobacco could not be sold. In addition, some things were inspected, but they were unfinished, and problems were discovered but not studied and resolved in time, or there was no inspection of the resolution situation. For example, last winter, it was discovered that many emancipated peasants in the Jingxing Mining Area were returning their land, and instructions were given to correct it after inspection. Later, when they saw the county's report: "It has been handled according to the instructions of the Prefectural Committee," they did not inspect it. An extremely unserious attitude was adopted towards such a major matter.
    (3) The style of事務ism (attending to administrative affairs) is serious, and the work of the government is taken over and replaced. Since the merger of regions, many central tasks have been planned by the Prefectural Committee, and county committees have been convened to arrange them. Even the specific work of organizing forces, urging and inspecting, and reporting experiences for these tasks has been taken over by the Prefectural Committee. When formulating production plans, the Prefectural Committee not only decided on the major principles and steps, but also calculated the specific arrangements and minor technical issues in each production season on a daily basis. Therefore, some comrades said: "The Prefectural Committee has made it so detailed and specific, what can the Agricultural Section of the Commissioner's Office do?" The county committees said: "It is not right to blur the lines between the Party and the government. But if we do it according to the instructions of the Prefectural Committee, there is no way to separate them." When asking the lower levels for materials, the Commissioner's Office asked for them and the Prefectural Committee asked for them again; the production joint meeting was held by the Commissioner's Office and then by the Prefectural Committee again. As a result of the Prefectural Committee's busyness, it is natural to reduce consideration of major principled issues. For example, the Prefectural Committee rarely studies issues such as industry and commerce, small towns, urban-rural relations, and county and district-level leadership; it relaxes leadership over Party affairs; and the Prefectural Committee does not understand what problems exist in rural branches. Inspections in rural areas are often everywhere, taking care of everything, lacking a clear center and focus. Another evil consequence of taking over and replacing is that it hinders the full play of the enthusiasm and creativity of government cadres and affects the prestige of the government.
    The reasons for these shortcomings are: first, the Party committee system of the Prefectural Committee is unsound, lacking collective leadership and a scientific division of labor system; second, the Prefectural Committee does not have a strong mass viewpoint and does not believe that government cadres can do their own work well; and third, it has inherited the working methods of the guerrilla war period. The Prefectural Committee has made a preliminary review of the above issues at the district and county-level cadre meeting on July 26, and will widely solicit opinions from various counties, units, and all Party member cadres to further conduct inspections to improve leadership and improve work.

### 检查我们的官僚主义作风

　　检查我们的官僚主义作风
　　河北石家庄地委宣传部
    编者按：石家庄地委的这个检查是有益于今后的工作的。但是这个检查也还存在着缺陷。在这个检查中，没有充分指明石家庄地委对政府工作的包办代替的这一个主要倾向。因为包办代替的作法，既会限制政权工作人员的责任心与创造性，又会助长党委工作中的某些错误倾向。但从这个检查中来看，石家庄地委在指出主观主义倾向时，并没有明确地批判这种工作方法的根本错误。实际上，无论在检查主观主义的倾向中，在检查形式主义的倾向（工作有布置，无检查）中，表现得最突出的是严重的对政府工作或对其他部门工作的代替包办。这在评定产量、布置打井、发放棉籽、技术训练等工作中都可以看到。这种党政不分的偏向，对于其他各地党委，同样也是应该继续注意加以克服的。
    自去年八月调整区划以来，在大多数干部的积极努力下，我区各项工作一般地都贯彻了政策，完成了上级所给予的任务。但从地委会的领导作风和工作方法上来看，确实还存在着许多问题。其中以脱离群众的官僚主义作风表现得最为严重与突出。因此，助长了下级机关和干部的官僚主义与强迫命令作风。经过初步检查，发现我们的官僚主义主要表现在以下几个方面：
    （一）主观主义，不按具体情况办事。主要是我们不善于作精密的调查研究工作，对本区基本情况只有概念的了解。因此在每一个工作任务到来时，常常不分析主客观条件，甚至明知存有问题，仍凭热情去实现主观愿望。在布置工作与分配任务中，就带有很大的盲目性。例如：在今春评订产量时，看到省府向我区要求的平均产量高出邻区不少，就产生了狭隘的本位主义思想，认为省府对我区要求太高。但本地区的实产量究竟该是多少，我们是弄不清楚的。后来在评订产量时，既无典型调查，又无一般标准来计算，而是从各县报上来的产量数对比中估计高低。对各地地质、土壤和一般经营条件，也很模糊。所以在任务分配后的很短期间，曾三次变动数字。各县一致提出：“专区应拿出标准来，免得变来变去，叫下边白费劲！”此外省领导机关原指示评产量要有重点进行，但我们却没有考虑主观力量，无重点的普遍进行。上级在农忙前一个月布置三级人民代表会议的选举工作。当时地委估计到时间短，工作多，这些任务很难完成，拟向省领导机关提意见。但又觉得这是省领导机关统一的决定，不会更改；同时又主观地认为现在赶紧作完，以后可以集中力量领导生产。于是就照样布置下去。结果非但评产量、三级选举工作都没作好，并且春耕准备工作也因此受到影响。再如：在布置打井工作时，未考虑各地区的打井条件，和群众的经济力量；未计算以同样贷粮主要用于修旧井是否对恢复生产更为有利，而主观的确定了打新井的任务。并且给没有打井条件的井陉也分配了一百一十眼，结果只完成了四眼。
    （二）缺乏严格的经常的检查工作。春初植棉工作中地委领导干部满足于准备了六百多万斤棉籽的数字，满足于供销合作社作了卖、换、贷出棉籽的布置，而未深入进行检查。实际上直到三月下旬，棉籽才发放到群众手里三十多万斤，其余到落雨后群众突击种棉时才手忙脚乱的贷出去。有些县因为手续不清，造成了今夏以麦还贷工作的困难。出贷过程中，由于检查不够，加以种棉宣传未普遍作好，有些农民贷了棉籽转卖、打油，或换肥料。同时，地委领导上主观地认为棉籽不错，未认真督促作发芽试验。实际上有一小部分棉籽因保存不善而霉烂，或好坏混杂。束鹿三区供销社甚至故意把不能用的棉籽和好籽掺和起来贷给农民。结果部分地区棉田因出苗不齐，又进行了毁种补种。除治棉蚜时也是满足于已进行了的技术训练，缺少逐级检查。地委且抓住少数好的例子向省委报告说：技术指导工作作得不错。但等到棉蚜普遍发生后，才发觉技术训练还多停留在村干部身上，并未深入群众中去，因此大部分群众还不知道治法；有的用卤水、煤油喷、热土埋等不好的方法，结果弄死了很多棉苗。除蚜用品也准备不足。有些县（如元氏）群众行动起来了，发觉烟叶不够用，便临时责成供销社购烟叶十万斤。但因买来较晚，落雨后蚜虫又下降，烟叶也就卖不出去了。此外，有些事情虽作了检查，但有头无尾，发现了问题未及时研究解决，或者对解决情形没有检查。如去冬发现井陉矿区不少翻身农民退地，检查后曾指示纠正。后来看到县里报告：“已按地委指示处理”，也就没检查。对这样重大事情采取了极不严肃的态度。
    （三）事务主义作风严重，包办代替政府工作。并区以来，有许多中心工作，都是由地委定计划，并召集县委开会布置的，甚至对这些工作的力量组织、督促检查、通报经验等具体工作，地委也都包揽下来。制定生产计划时，地委不仅决定了大的原则、步骤，连每一生产季节中的具体安排，细小技术问题都按时日计算出来。因此有的同志说：“地委弄的这样详细具体，专署农业科可干什么呢？”县委讲：“党政不分不对。可是若按地委指示去办就没法分开。”向下面要材料，专署要了地委又要；生产联席会也是专署开了地委又开。地委这样忙乱的结果，自然要减弱对大的原则问题的考虑。如工商业、小城镇工作，城乡关系、县、区级领导等问题地委很少研究；对党务工作就放松领导；对农村支部中究竟存在着什么问题，地委就不了解。下乡检查也往往是处处顾、事事顾，缺乏明确的中心和重点。包办代替的另一个恶果，就是妨碍了政府干部的积极性与创造性的充分发挥，并影响了政府的威信。
    形成这些缺点的原因，一是地委党委制不健全，缺乏集体领导，科学分工制度；二是地委群众观点不强，不相信政府干部能作好自己的工作；三是因袭了游击战争时期的工作方法。地委已就以上问题在七月二十六日区、县级干部大会上作了初步检讨，并将普遍征求各县各单位和全体党员干部的意见，进一步进行检查，以改进领导，改进工作。
