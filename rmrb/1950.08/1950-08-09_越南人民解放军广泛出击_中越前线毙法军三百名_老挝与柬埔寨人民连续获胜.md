Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnam People's Liberation Army engaged in combat with a French colonial army motorized column on June 21st on a four-mile front between Guangping and Guangzhi provinces in Sino-Vietnam. As a result, 300 French troops were killed, two French aircraft were shot down, and a large number of weapons and ammunition were seized.
    In South Vietnam, the People's Liberation Army launched multiple attacks on French troops in the Province of Kiến Tường, southwest of Saigon, in early June, destroying 11 French bunkers, capturing three mortars and 90 rifles, and sinking 20 French landing craft. In early July, the Liberation Army killed or captured 250 French African troops in the same area.
    North Vietnamese People's guerrillas attacked a French paratrooper barracks near Hanoi on the south bank of the Red River on the evening of July 17th, burning down a French gasoline depot and ten trucks, and killing or wounding several French paratroopers.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: According to a combined dispatch from the Telegraph Agency in Yangon: The Lao people have achieved many victories both on the battlefield and in the rear. For example, in May of this year, when the Lao People's Liberation Army repelled the attacking French troops in the south, they killed French commander Major Vencala and many French troops, and seized a large amount of French material. In the rear, as a result of the Lao people launching competitions, rice production has doubled compared to last year. A nationwide literacy campaign is also underway in Laos.
    When the Cambodian People's Liberation Army liberated the French stronghold of Riche (transliteration) in early June, they seized a large number of French weapons, and 70 French puppet troops surrendered to the Liberation Army in this battle.
