Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 1st (TASS): *Pravda*'s foreign affairs observer, Marinin, commenting on the meeting of the Assistant Secretaries of State of the North Atlantic Aggression Group (note: this meeting was held in London on July 25th), stated that the reason for convening this meeting was that the great upsurge of the world peace movement and the victories of the Korean people had aroused fear in the hearts of the warmongers. The strength of the North Atlantic Aggression Group has been tested in the Korean War of Aggression, and despite Acheson's repeated appeals, America's partners prefer to limit themselves to providing the United States with "symbolic" assistance more than practical assistance. The US ruling clique's hasty convening of this meeting is to tie their partners more tightly to their own war chariot.

To achieve the above objectives, the United States' plan is: first, to reorganize the internal organization of the North Atlantic Group "system." Second, to accelerate the transition of Western European economies to a wartime footing. Third, to accelerate the militarization of West Germany. However, each aspect of this plan leads to a further sharpening of contradictions within the North Atlantic camp. First, the United States attempts to give the Standing Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Military Committee "executive power." In practice, this means giving dictatorial power to the chairman of the committee, Bradley, and excluding the Western European Union "Defense Committee" headed by British Marshal Montgomery from the North Atlantic Treaty system. In terms of shifting the Western European economy to a wartime footing, the United States requires Western Europe to adopt a special scale and pace, and if the US requirements are to be met, this will inevitably cause the deepest disruption and disarray of the entire Western European economy. In accelerating the militarization of West Germany, the United States is using the so-called Schuman Plan to ensure that the Ruhr giants can directly participate in the basic core of the North Atlantic Aggression Group, and is granting West Germany the task of serving as the main assault force of US imperialism. This fact first makes the contradictions between the US and Britain and between France and Germany more acute.

The conspirators who sabotage peace are divided because of their internal contradictions. Behind the scenes of the North Atlantic Group, imperialists are fighting and scheming for their own interests, mutually undermining each other.

### 真理报发表马里宁专文指出  北大西洋集团勾心斗角  侵朝战事暴露帝国主义阵营的矛盾  美召开外长助理会议以谋加强控制

　　真理报发表马里宁专文指出
    北大西洋集团勾心斗角
    侵朝战事暴露帝国主义阵营的矛盾
    美召开外长助理会议以谋加强控制
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：真理报外交观察家马里宁评论北大西洋侵略集团的外长助理会议（按该会议曾于上月二十五日在伦敦召开）称：召开这个会议的原因，是因为世界和平运动的巨大高涨，和朝鲜人民的胜利在战争贩子心中引起了恐惧。北大西洋侵略集团的力量，在朝鲜侵略战争中受到了考验，虽然有艾奇逊的一再号召，美国的伙计们却宁肯使自己限于只给美国“象征”意义更多于实际意义的援助。美国统治集团之匆匆召开这个会议，就是要把他们的伙计们在他自己的战车上捆得更紧些。
    为达到上述目的，美国的计划就是：第一，北大西洋集团“体系”内部组织上的重新调整。第二，加速使西欧经济转入战时体制。第三，加速西德的军事化。但是，这个计划的每一方面，都引致北大西洋阵营内部矛盾进一步的尖锐化。首先，美国企图交给北大西洋公约军事委员会常设委员会以“执行权”。实际上，这就是交给该委员会主席布莱德雷以独裁权，而把以英国元帅蒙哥马利为首的西欧联盟“防务委员会”排斥在北大西洋公约体系以外。在把西欧经济转入战时体制方面，美国要求西欧采取特别的规模与步调，如果要满足美国的要求，就将不可避免地引起整个西欧经济最深巨的脱节与紊乱。而在加速西德军事化方面，美国正在借所谓舒曼计划而保证鲁尔巨头得以直接参加北大西洋侵略集团的基本核心，并正授予西德以担任美帝国主义主要突击部队的任务，这种事实首先就使美英之间与法德之间的矛盾更为尖锐化。
    破坏和平的阴谋家们，因为他们的内部矛盾而分裂了，在北大西洋集团的幕后，帝国主义者正在为各自的利益而勾心斗角，彼此倾轧。
