Beijing's Traffic Order Improves
　　Car Accidents Significantly Reduced

[This newspaper] News: According to the Beijing News Agency, since the Beijing Municipal People's Government promulgated the "Revised Provisional Traffic Management Rules," and after the Municipal Public Security Bureau rectified the city's traffic in June, the city's traffic order has improved significantly, basically eliminating the serious phenomenon of increasingly chaotic traffic in the city during April and May. In this rectification work, the method of combining persuasion and education with penalties for violations was adopted. Those vehicles without license plates, not turning on lights at night, rushing, driving side-by-side, speeding, parking without order, cart drivers not getting out of the car to lead livestock, pedestrians not walking on sidewalks, and other violations were dealt with according to the circumstances, including education, warnings, detention, labor service, and fines. Unauthorized street vendors and sheds, wooden pavilions, and stacking operations were banned, and vendors with licenses who obstructed traffic were also mobilized to move into markets or other areas. According to statistics from the Public Security Bureau, after the traffic rectification, the percentage of vehicles not turning on lights at night accounted for 9.7 percent; a decrease of 55.7 percent compared to before the rectification; during the traffic rectification, a total of five relatively serious car accidents occurred, a decrease of 41.7 percent compared to the eighteen in February this year, and a decrease of 50 percent compared to the average of one every two days in March, April, and May. The regular management of citywide traffic has also been laid a foundation due to this focused management.

The general public, workers, students, and government cadres have all responded very well to this traffic rectification. Only individual rickshaw pullers, cart drivers, and vendors believe that the restrictions are too strict. This is mainly because they only see their own interests and do not see the benefits of rectifying traffic order for the benefit of all citizens. Persuasion and education still need to be continued in the future.

　　京市交通秩序好转
    车祸显著减少
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：自京市人民政府公布了“修正交通管理暂行规则”以来，经过市公安局在六月间整理全市的交通，市内交通秩序已有显著好转，基本上消灭了四、五月间市内交通渐趋紊乱的严重现象。在这次整理工作中，采取了说服教育与违章处罚相结合的方法。对车辆无牌照，夜不燃灯，抢行，并行，超速行驶，停车不守秩序，大车工人不下车牵引牲畜，行人不走便道，以及其他违章事件分别情况予以教育，警告，拘留，劳役，罚金等处理；并且取缔了无照摊贩及棚户，木阁，堆物作业等，对于妨碍交通的有照摊贩亦动员其迁入市场或其他地区。根据公安局的统计，在整理交通后夜不燃灯的车辆占有百分之九点七；较整理前减少了百分之五十五点七；整理交通中发生比较严重的车祸共五起，比今年二月份的十八起减少百分之四十一点七，比三、四、五月份平均两天发生一起减低了百分之五十。全市交通的经常管理工作，也因这次重点管理而奠定了基础。
    对于这次整理交通，一般市民、工人、学生、机关干部的反映全都很好。只有个别三轮车工人、大车工人和摊贩，认为限制太严，这主要是由于他们只看到本身的利益，没有看到整理交通秩序对全体市民的利益，今后还需继续进行说服教育。
