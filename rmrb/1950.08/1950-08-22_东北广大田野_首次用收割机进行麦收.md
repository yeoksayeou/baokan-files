　　Northeast Vast Fields
    First Use of Combine Harvesters for Wheat Harvest
    【Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th】 This year's wheat harvest marks the first time that a large number of new Soviet combine harvesters have appeared in the fields of Northeast China. The twelve state-run mechanical farms in Northeast China have universally used automatic combine harvesters and tractor-pulled combine harvesters to harvest wheat. The former can harvest 320 mu of wheat every ten hours, and the latter can harvest 250 mu every ten hours. This year, the Gongzhuling Mechanical Farm in Jilin Province used the 1949 and 1950 models of "Stalin VI" (tractor-pulled) and "Stalin IV" (automatic) combine harvesters for the first time. Calculated at the slowest speed, each machine can harvest 23 to 24 mu of wheat per hour, including both harvesting and threshing. The Huachuan Mechanical Farm in Songjiang Province dispatched ten combine harvesters and eighteen rocker arm harvesters, completing the harvesting of more than 14,800 mu of wheat in just eight days. The Chahayang Farm and Zhaoguang Farm in Heilongjiang Province implemented a combined mechanical operation method, which increased the wheat harvesting efficiency by more than four times compared to last year.
    Many mutual aid teams in the rural areas of Northeast China also used Soviet-made horse-drawn harvesters loaned to them by the government. The Sun Shaoyan mutual aid team in Shulan County, Jilin Province, drove a horse-drawn harvester and harvested 22 mu of wheat in one day, saving eight man-days per mu compared to using sickles in previous years. Wang Zhentang's team, a famous agricultural labor model in Heilongjiang Province, used a rocker arm harvester to harvest 50 mu of wheat in one day, saving sixteen man-days, which were used for weeding.

　　东北广大田野
    首次用收割机进行麦收
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】今年麦收中，东北田野上首次出现了大批苏联新式收割机。东北十二个国营机械农场普遍使用了自动的联合收割机与拖拉机牵引的联合收割机割麦，前者每十小时可收麦三百二十亩，后者每十小时可收二百五十亩。吉林省营公主岭机械农场今年首次使用了一九四九年式与一九五○年式的“斯大林六型”（拖拉机牵引）与“斯大林四型”（自动）联合收割机，以最慢的速度计算，每台每小时连收带打可收麦二十三亩至二十四亩。松江省营桦川机械农场出动了十台联合收割机和十八台摇臂收割机，仅八天时间即割完一万四千八百余亩小麦。黑龙江省营查哈阳农场和赵光农场实行机械联结使用法的结果，使割麦效率比去年提高四倍以上。
    东北农村中还有不少互助组使用了政府贷给他们的苏联制造的马拉收割机。吉林省舒兰县农民孙绍岩互助组，驾驶一台马拉收割机一天割完二十二亩小麦，比往年用镰刀收割每亩省了八个人工。黑龙江省著名农业劳动模范王振堂小组用摇臂收割机一天割完五十亩小麦，省下十六个人工用来进行锄草。
