　　Wuhan Adjusts Salt Prices
　　Special Correspondent for this newspaper, Xiao Hang
　　Wuhan's adjustment of salt prices, like the adjustment of other major daily necessities, includes seeking reasonable regional price differences, striving for consistency between listed prices and market prices, and maintaining a reasonable difference between retail and wholesale prices. Especially since Hankou is the salt transportation and sales center of Hubei, obtaining reasonable regional price differences is a crucial link in the transportation and sales of salt and stabilizing commodity prices. After several months of effort by the Wuhan Salt Industry Company and relevant authorities, considerable progress has been made in terms of regional price differences and the adjustment of listed prices and market prices.
    I. Grasping Reasonable Regional Price Differences
    As early as when prices were turning from decline to stability, i.e., in late March and early April, the difference between salt prices in Hankou and other regions showed very unreasonable phenomena: in late March, the major sales areas throughout the province were generally 40 to 60 percent higher than the price in Hankou, and in early April they were still more than 27 percent higher. In this way, the profit of the vendors exceeded the reasonable limit of 10 percent; for example, the profit of transporting salt to Shashi for sale was as high as 30 percent. This greatly increased the burden on consumers. At the same time, salt merchants and some public-owned stores from other regions were competing to sell their stored salt at low prices in Hankou, and the prices were very inconsistent, which greatly increased the difficulty for the Salt Industry Company in controlling salt prices and transportation and sales plans. Therefore, adjusting regional price differences became an important task at that time.
    One of the central links of the adjustment work was to lower the then-overly-high listed price. After the adjustment, by late April, the regional difference had been reduced by about 20 percent, and the phenomenon of excessively large differences in the past no longer existed. However, this did not solve all the problems of regional price differences. For example, the question of "what constitutes a reasonable regional price difference" had not yet been clearly resolved.
    At this time, the government carried out the following work to explore a more accurate and reasonable regional price difference. The first step was to use the market conditions of fifteen important towns, including Hankou, Xindi, Shashi, Yichang, Enshi, Laohekou, and Echeng, as the basis, and with Hankou as the center, make a more accurate calculation of salt prices from August of last year to mid-April of this year, to clarify the general regional price difference situation after liberation. The second step was to study the general level of salt prices in various places based on the salt price in Hankou, plus transportation costs, loading and unloading fees, capital interest, packaging losses, taxes, other miscellaneous payments, and commercial profits, and then calculate the percentage of Hankou's price that salt prices in various places should account for. At this time, it was discovered that the average ratio of the market was higher than the ratio obtained by the government according to the transportation and sales routes, except for Laohekou, Xiaogan, and Fancheng. The reason was that the actual transportation cost was higher than the government estimated, because the expenses of merchants were generally larger. Secondly, some areas were also affected by the higher general price level. As for the reason why the ratios in Xiaogan and other three places were lower, it was because these towns were close to Henan and would directly import salt from Henan, and the salt price in Henan was usually lower than that in Hankou. Based on these materials, a third step was taken: according to the average ratio of various places and the expected difference calculated from the transportation and sales routes, while taking into account the actual situation in various places and referring to the general price level, the reasonable difference between Hankou and various places was studied. This difference was: with the salt price in Hankou as 100, the salt price in Enshi should be 186, Zigui 148, Yunyang 139, Yichang 134, Shashi, Songbu, and Shayang 133, Sui County 131, Laohekou 127, Fancheng and Xindi 126, Tuanfeng and Echeng 120, and Xiaogan 117. In this way, a reasonable measure of regional price differences was determined.
    According to this measure, the government checked the regional price differences in late April and prepared for further adjustments. The significant phenomenon seen at this time was that regional price differences were generally narrowing. Originally, this was a good phenomenon. However, the narrowing of regional price differences should be: first, the improvement of transportation conditions, etc.; second, the convergence of the general price level, which is normal. However, the narrowing of regional price differences in late April was caused by the following reasons: after the adjustment of the listed price in Hankou, the market price not only did not fall, but rose, because the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce organized an oil and salt exchange, using administrative power to control the salt price, and supervised merchants to not sell below the listed price and disrupt the market. Therefore, the market price had risen to about 180,000 yuan, consistent with the listed price (the listed price at that time was 180,000 yuan). The salt prices in other regions fell, for example, Shashi fell from 260,000 to 210,000 yuan. In this way, although the regional price difference had narrowed, the transport merchants could only barely break even, with no money to be made. If this continued to develop, it would inevitably lead to imbalances in supply and demand, and unreasonably increase the regional price difference again. Therefore, the government believed that further adjustments were necessary. That is, except for Yunyang and Tuanfeng, which were higher than the reasonable price difference and should be slightly lowered, other regions should appropriately increase or maintain the existing difference by referring to the general price level in the local area, because they were all lower than the reasonable price difference. After this adjustment, by late May, the regional price differences in Yichang, Fancheng, and other places were close to reasonable again.
    However, by early June, this gradually reasonable regional price difference had undergone great changes again. The profits of merchants in various places were again higher than 10 percent, and Shashi reached 25 percent, with prices 40 percent higher than in Hankou. This was because: from June 1st, the salt tax was reduced by half, and the salt price in Hankou plummeted, with a range of 7 to 30 percent, while the downward trend in various places was relatively slow. Because most of the branches of the Salt Industry Company had not been established, and there were still limited consignment stores in various places, it was impossible to control the market well. At the same time, some merchants were unwilling to reduce prices sharply, wanting to take the opportunity to make more money; other merchants were unwilling to sell because the purchase price was relatively high and the compensation problem had not been thoroughly resolved in a timely manner. Later, not only was the compensation problem resolved, but also, by late June, seven salt industry branches had been established in various places, and consignment stores had also developed to more than forty, which could generally control the market, so the regional price difference in late June was roughly close to reasonable again. For example, the ratio of Shashi was 135, Yichang 130, Xiaogan 110, Echeng 112, Fancheng 114, Tuanfeng 122, Xindi 116, and Enshi 210. Among them, only Yunyang, because the salt industry branch had not yet been established, the merchants raised the price, and Enshi was affected by the high price of Sichuan salt and the higher general price level, still had a larger difference, while Fancheng, Xindi, and Echeng seemed to be slightly lower, so the government proposed to continue to adjust.
    The experience of adjusting regional price differences over the past few months shows that the market price guidance authorities and the Salt Industry Company should cooperate closely in action. The former must put forward guiding opinions at any time based on market changes, and the latter must absorb these opinions in a timely manner and improve its business. In Wuhan, this is done quite well, so the results are also quite significant. However, the exchange ratio of commodities and regional price differences are determined by many factors, and a change in one of the factors will cause changes in the exchange ratio and regional price differences. Therefore, continuing to carry forward the spirit of the above-mentioned coordinated action is the guarantee for accurately grasping reasonable regional price differences.
    II. Eliminating the Abnormal State of Market Prices Lower Than Listed Prices
    The abnormal state of market prices of salt in Wuhan being lower than listed prices existed continuously for nearly five months from January 6th to May 30th this year. It was not until the last day of May that the market price was consistent with the listed price. The main reason for the serious disconnection between the market price and the listed price of salt at that time, like the situation shown in the prices of other commodities, was the disappearance of false purchasing power and the temporary reduction of real purchasing power. However, the reason why the price of salt seemed more serious was another reason: first, at the beginning of this year, the salt tax was changed from 25 jin of rice per dan to 100 jin of rice, and some transport merchants got this news in advance, so they tried their best to buy. According to statistics, more than 300,000 dan of salt entered Hankou in January. Secondly, in February, prices were fluctuating, and according to the rice conversion price, the salt tax on February 1st was 97,900 yuan per 100 jin, and on February 15th it rose to 184,000 yuan, and some merchants used the convenience of mortgage payment and remittance to buy another batch of salt. These two purchases made the salt inventory in Wuhan far exceed the required amount. Then came the fall in prices, and the capital turnover of the salt merchants was bound to be difficult, so they competed with each other to sell. Third, after the fall in prices, all goods were unsalable, but the native product market was always very active. Some salt merchants attempted to transfer funds and engage in native product business, so they depreciated the salt price again and again, just wanting to sell it out as soon as possible. As a result, the salt price plummeted, which had a considerable impact on the business of the Salt Industry Company and legitimate salt merchants, so that from April to May, almost no salt merchants in Wuhan went to the north to transport salt. As a result, the plan of determining transportation by sales and production by transportation encountered great difficulties.
    However, the sharp fall in salt prices did not bring any benefits to consumers. Because at that time, unreasonable phenomena had occurred in regional differences, the economic burden on consumers in the vast rural areas and small cities was not reduced. For example, merchants bought it in Hankou for 167,000 yuan per dan, and had to sell it in Shashi for 261,000 yuan. So the only ones who benefited were some merchants from other places.
    Therefore, changing this state of indiscriminate prices became the unanimous request of producers, consumers, and legitimate salt merchants. The government also made great efforts for this, but it was not until May, after important changes had taken place in the objective situation, that this problem was solved. At this time, the salt stock of the salt merchants was quite thin, and they began to consider the cost of continuing transportation and sales. Secondly, the continued rise in the prices of major native products attracted merchants from far away to Hankou to do business, such as merchants from Ankang in southern Shaanxi and Xichuan in southern Henan, who transported native products to Hankou for sale. Most of them exchanged salt for it. This greatly increased the salt sales in Hankou. In addition, the spring famine had passed, spring wheat was on the market, and the purchasing power of rural areas gradually increased. At the same time, the salt reserves of the vast consumers had been greatly reduced. Under these circumstances, the objective conditions for the market price to approach the listed price had been met. The government seized this opportunity, on the one hand, to continue to expand sales, and on May 8th, it abolished the Chenglingji (Yueyang, Hunan) ban card at the Yangtze River exit, so that Hubei salt could be freely transported and sold in Hunan; on the other hand, it strengthened market management, strictly investigated and reported indiscriminate sales, and punished salt merchants who disrupted market order, and on May 5th, it froze 650 dan of salt from Fufeng Salt Store, prohibiting the store from selling it below the listed price (180,000 yuan) for 156,000 yuan. This made speculative merchants worried. At the same time, by late May, merchants in Changsha and Shashi and Yichang in western Hubei mostly switched to transporting sea salt because the cost of Sichuan salt was too high, and the salt sales in Hankou were further expanded. In this way, with the combination of subjective and objective conditions, the abnormal state of market prices being lower than listed prices, which had lasted for five months, was changed. By May 31st, the market price of Huai salt had risen to 180,000, and the price of Lu salt had risen to 173,000 yuan, all equal to the listed price. And on the 30th and 31st, Jiuda Salt Industry Company had even made a store delivery price of 178,000 yuan for Lu salt, which had exceeded the listed price.
    This normal state was maintained for more than half a month, and it was disrupted again on June 17th. Originally, transport merchants in Hankou had to have a letter of introduction from the state-owned salt industry company to transport and purchase Huai salt in Xinpu, because this could ensure the implementation of the planned free transport and sales policy. However, in mid-June, Xinpu suddenly cancelled these procedures and allowed private merchants to purchase and transport at will. When some transport merchants in Hankou heard the news, they flocked to it; the distributors collectively transported and purchased. They found buyers in advance, and could sell the goods as soon as the car entered the station, saving the costs of loading, unloading, and warehousing, with a cost of about 95,600 yuan to 100,000 yuan, selling for 112,300 yuan, which could still make money, but the listed price was 117,000 yuan. In this way, the market price and the listed price were disconnected again, and legitimate merchants suffered a considerable blow. They automatically reported to the state-owned salt industry company, stating that some merchants said on the surface that the selling price was 117,000 yuan, the same as the listed price, but in fact, the selling price was 112,300 yuan. However, initially, neither the state-owned salt industry company nor the legitimate merchants could figure out the crux of the problem. Legitimate merchants expressed their willingness to assist the government in investigating the situation. In this way, the loophole was quickly discovered in Xinpu. Therefore, the state-owned salt industry company immediately telegraphed Beijing, and on June 29th, Xinpu restored the necessary system, and by early July, the market price was higher than the listed price again.

　　武汉调整食盐价格
    本报特派记者  萧航
    武汉市对于食盐价格的调整，如同对其他主要日用物品价格的调整一样，包括了求得合理的地区差价，争取牌价与市价一致，以及保持零售价和批发价的相当差额等。特别是汉口乃湖北的食盐运销中心，因而求得合理的地区差价，更是运销食盐和平稳物价的重要环节之一。武汉盐业公司及有关机关经过几个月的努力，在地区差价、牌价与市价调整方面，已经作出了相当成绩。
    一、掌握合理的地区差价
    还是在物价由落转稳的时候，即三月下旬与四月上旬，汉口和各地的食盐价格差额，发生了很不合理的现象：全省各主要销地，三月下旬一般高出汉口价格的百分之四十到六十，四月上旬还高出百分之二十七以上。这样，贩商的利润就超过了百分之十的合理限度，如运盐到沙市销售，利润竟高达百分之三十。这样就大大增加了消费者的负担。同时，盐商和若干外地公营商店都在汉口竞相低价抛售存盐，价格很不一致，极大地增加了盐业公司掌握盐价以及运销计划的困难。因此，调整地区差价，就成了当时的重要课题。
    调整工作的中心环节之一，是降低当时过高的牌价。经调整后，到四月下旬，地区差额缩小了百分之二十左右，过去差额过大的现象，已不复存在。但是，这还没有解决了地区差价的全部问题。比方，“地区差价究竟怎样才算合理”这一问题，就还不曾得到明确解决。
    这时，政府进行了以下的工作，来探究较为精确的合理地区差价。第一步，以汉口、新堤、沙市、宜昌、恩施、老河口、鄂城等十五个重要城镇的市场情况，作为依据，而又以汉口为中心，把从去年八月到今年四月中旬的盐价作了比较精确的计算，弄清了解放后一般的地区差价状况。第二步，根据汉口的盐价，加上运费、装卸费、资金利息、包装损耗、税捐、其他杂缴以及商业利润，研究了各地一般水平的盐价，再伸算出各地盐价应占汉口的百分比。这时，发现了市场的平均比数，除老河口、孝感、樊城三地外，其他城镇都比政府按照运销路线所得的比数为高。原因是实际的贩运成本，比政府估计的要高些，因为商人的开支一般较大。其次，有些地区也受了一般物价水平较高的影响。至于孝感等三地比数较低的原因，是这些城镇靠近河南，会从河南直接输入食盐，而河南盐价通常比汉口低些。根据这些材料，又作了第三步工作：依照各地平均比数和从运销路线推算出来的应有差额，同时照顾到各地实际情况，并参照一般的物价水平，研究了汉口和各地的合理差额。这个差额是：以汉口盐价为一百，恩施盐价应是一八六，秭归是一四八，郧阳是一三九，宜昌是一三四，沙市、宋埠、沙洋是一三三，随县是一三一，老河口是一二七，樊城、新堤是一二六，团风、鄂城是一二○，孝感是一一七。这样，衡量地区差价的合理尺度，被确定了下来。
    根据这个尺度，政府对四月下旬的地区差价作了检查，准备进一步调整。这时看到的显著现象是：地区差价一般缩小。本来，这是一种很好的现象。但是，地区差价的缩小，应该是：第一，交通运输条件等的改善；第二，一般物价水平的接近，这才是正常的。可是四月下旬地区差价的缩小，却是由于下述原因造成的，就是：汉口牌价调整以后，市价不但没有下跌，反而提高，因为武汉市工商局组织了油盐交易所，用行政力量控制了盐价，监督商人不能低过牌价抛售、扰乱市场。因而市价曾提升到十八万元左右，和牌价一致起来（当时的牌价是十八万元）。其他地区的盐价却降落了，像沙市就从二十六万降到二十一万元。这样，地区差价虽然已经缩小，运商却只能刚刚保本，无钱可赚。这样发展下去，必然会供求失调，又使地区差价不合理地增大起来。因此，政府认为有继续调整的必要。即除郧阳、团风高过于合理差价应稍稍压低外，其他地区因为全低于合理差价，应该参照当地一般物价水平，适当加以提高或保持现有差额。经过这次调整，到五月下旬，宜昌、樊城等地的地区差价又接近于合理。
    但是，到了六月上旬，这种逐步走向合理的地区差价，又发生了很大的变化。各地贩商的利润又高出了百分之十，沙市却达到了百分之二十五，价格高出汉口百分之四十。这是因为：六月一日起，盐税减半征收，汉口盐价陡降，幅度在百分之七到百分之三十之间，而各地下落趋势却是比较缓慢。因为盐业公司的分支机构多半没有建立，各地代销店也还有限，没法很好的控制市场。同时，一部分商人不愿猛降，想乘机多赚一些钱；另一部分商人因为进价比较高，补偿问题又没有及时得到彻底解决，不愿出售。后来不仅补偿问题已经解决，而且，到了六月下旬，各地盐业分支公司已经建立了七处，代销店也发展到了四十多处，大体上能够控制市场了，所以六月下旬的地区差价又大体接近合理。如沙市的比数是一三五，宜昌是一三○，孝感是一一○，鄂城是一一二，樊城是一一四，团风是一二二，新堤是一一六，恩施是二一零，郧阳是一八六。其中只有郧阳因为盐业分公司还没建立，商人提高了价格，恩施受川盐价高、一般物价水平较高等影响，还有着较大的差额外，樊城、新堤和鄂城则显得稍低了些，所以政府又提出继续调整。
    几个月来调整地区差价的经验说明，市场价格的指导机关和盐业公司，在行动上应该密切配合。前者须随时依据市场变化，提出指导意见，后者须及时吸取这些意见，改进业务。在武汉，这一点是做得相当好的，所以成绩也是相当大的。但是，商品的交换比率以及地区差价，是被许多因素决定的，其中一种因素的变化，就会引起交换比率和地区差价的变动。因此，继续发扬上述配合行动的精神，乃是确切掌握合理地区差价的保证。
    二、消灭市价低于牌价的畸形状态
    武汉食盐市价低于牌价的畸形状态，从今年一月六日到五月三十日，连续存在了将近五个月。直到五月份的最末一天，市价才和牌价一致起来。当时食盐市价和牌价严重脱节的主要原因，也和其他商品价格所表现的情况一样，是由于虚假购买力的消失，真实购买力的暂时降低。但，食盐价格之所以显得比较严重，却是另有原因：第一，今年年初，盐税从每担二十五斤米改征一百斤米，一部分运商事先得到了这个消息，于是拚命抢购。据统计，一月份汉口进盐达三十多万担。其次，二月间，物价正在波动，按米折价，二月一日的盐税是每百斤九万七千九百元，二月十五日就涨到了十八万四千元，一部分商人，利用押款押汇的便利，又抢购了一批食盐。这两次抢购，使武汉的存盐大大超过了需要量。接着是物价下落，盐商的资金周转当然要发生困难，于是又互相竞销。第三，物价下落以后，各货滞销，土产市场却始终很活跃。一部分盐商企图转移资金，经营土产业务，于是把食盐价格一贬再贬，只想早一天卖光。因而盐价一落千丈，使盐业公司和正当盐商的营业都受到了相当大的影响，以致从四月到五月，武汉盐商几乎没有人到北方去运盐。结果是以销定运、以运定产的计划，遭遇了极大的困难。
    但是，盐价的猛落，却没有给消费者带来什么好处。因为当时地区差额曾发生过不合理的现象，广大农村及小城市的消费者，其经济负担并未减轻。例如，贩商在汉口以十六万七千元一担购进，到沙市要卖二十六万一千元。所以占便宜的仅仅是一部分外地的贩商。
    因此，改变这种滥价状态，成了生产者、消费者、正当盐商的一致要求。政府也为此作了很大的努力，但直到五月份，客观情况有了重要变化之后。这一问题才得到解决。这时盐商存盐已经相当稀薄，开始考虑继续运销的成本问题。其次，主要土产价格的继续上涨，吸引了远路商贩来汉口做生意，像陕西南部的安康，河南南部的淅川等地的商贩，都运土产来汉销售。他们多半是换购食盐回去。这就大大增加了汉口的食盐销量。再就是春荒已经过去，春麦登场，农村购买力逐渐提高。同时，广大消费者的食盐存量已经大减。在这种种情况下面，使市价接近牌价的客观条件，已经具备。政府就抓紧了这个时机，一面继续扩大销路，于五月八日撤销了长江出口处的城陵矶（湖南岳阳）禁卡，使湖北食盐自由运销湖南；一面加强市场管理，严格检举滥价出售行为，惩办破坏市场秩序的盐商，于五月五日冻结了复丰盐号的六百五十担食盐，禁止该号以低于牌价（十八万元）的十五万六千元抛售。这使得投机商人有了顾虑。同时，到五月下旬，长沙以及鄂西沙市、宜昌一带的商人，因川盐成本过高，多半改运海盐，汉口的食盐销路更加扩大。这样，主观客观条件一结合，连续了五个月之久的市价低于牌价的畸形状态被改变过来。到五月三十一日，淮盐市价提高到了十八万，芦盐提高到十七万三千元，全和牌价等同起来。而久大盐业公司在三十、三十一两日，芦盐还曾做到十七万八千元的店交价格，已经超过了牌价。
    这种正常状态保持了半个多月，到六月十七日，又被破坏了。本来，汉口运商到新浦运购淮盐，必须有国营盐业公司的介绍信才行，因为这样才能保证贯彻有计划的自由运销政策。可是六月中旬，新浦突然取消了这些手续，允许私商随便购运。汉口的某些运商一听风声，蜂拥而去；销商则集体运购。他们事先找好买主，车一进站，就能卖货，省了装卸、入仓等费用，成本大约是九万五、六千元到十万元，卖十一万二、三千元，尚可赚钱，牌价却是十一万七千元。这一来，市价和牌价又脱了节，正当商人受到不小的打击。他们自动报告了国营盐业公司，说明某些商人表面说卖价是十一万七千元，和牌价一样，实际上，卖价却是十一万二、三千元。但是，最初，不论国营盐业公司，不论正当商人，都还弄不清问题的症结。正当商人表示愿意协助政府调查情况。这样，很快发现了漏洞出在新浦。因此，国营盐业公司立即电告北京，到六月二十九日，新浦又恢复了必要的制度，至七月初，市价又高于牌价了。
