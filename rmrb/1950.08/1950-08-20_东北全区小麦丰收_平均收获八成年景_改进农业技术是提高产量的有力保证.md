Northeast China Achieves Overall Wheat Harvest with Average Yields of 80% - Improved Agricultural Techniques Provide a Powerful Guarantee for Increased Production

[Shenyang News] Northeast Daily News: The more than 700,000 hectares of wheat in Northeast China were harvested successively from mid to late July according to the season, and all harvesting has now been completed.

Although some areas of Northeast China's wheat crop suffered from disease, resulting in a slight decrease in production, the average harvest for the entire region is still at 80% of a good year (previously underestimated at 70%, while Northeast wheat fields usually only yield about 60%). For example, Heilongjiang Province, which accounts for nearly half of the region's planting area (320,000 hectares), has wheat kernels that are fuller than they have been in the past four or five years, averaging 70% of a good year. The minimum average yield per hectare is over 1,200 jin of wheat, an increase of over 100 jin per hectare compared to last year (a normal year). Songjiang Province, which accounts for the second-largest planting area in the region, achieved its first wheat harvest since the "September 18th Incident," averaging 80% of a good year. The average yield per hectare is over 1,600 jin, an increase of more than two times compared to last year (a poor harvest) of 450 jin per hectare. In other areas such as Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Lushun-Dalian, wheat yields range from 80% to 90%. The achievement of this result, in addition to favorable rainfall and suitable cultivation, is due to the implementation of this year's new agricultural production policy - improving agricultural techniques, which is a powerful guarantee for increasing production. Before spring plowing, government leaders at all levels carried out a series of activities such as seed selection, trial planting, seed disinfection, and fertilization. For example, the inferior oil wheat, which originally accounted for 30% of the seeds, was reduced by 15% after careful selection. The universal trial planting improved the germination rate, and the wheat trial-planted in Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, maintained a germination rate of 98%. In areas where "Wangtong" disinfection was partially used, smut disease was basically eliminated. In Haicheng County, Liaodong Province, 120,000 mu of wheat were disinfected with "Wangtong," and it is estimated from the harvest that 2 million jin more can be harvested than without disinfection. At the same time, the Northeast People's Government promoted 22,000 hectares of excellent varieties such as "Kehua" in various promotion areas, which not only had good quality but also yielded more than ordinary wheat by at least 15%.

From the results of the wheat harvest, it is proved that the importance and study of agricultural production technology by county and district leading agricultural production cadres is one of the main keys to improving and promoting agricultural production technology. Taking the use of "Wangtong" disinfection as an example, many county and district cadres repeatedly studied the "Wangtong Usage Method" booklet issued by the Northeast People's Government or the Provincial People's Government, and deeply publicized it to farmers, so that farmers carried out disinfection in accordance with the prescribed usage methods, which achieved the effect of eliminating smut disease and left a good impression on farmers. Secondly, because the actual effect of improving agricultural technology was seen from the wheat harvest results, the farmers' understanding of improving agricultural technology was improved. Before the harvest, various places organized women, children and other semi-labor forces to pull out the Wudan and oil wheat. During the harvest, mass seed selection movements were launched in various places, and under the leadership of governments at all levels, single cutting, single threshing, and separate storage were implemented, and exchanges were carried out with each other to ensure sufficient good seeds for next year. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Commerce of Heilongjiang Province are also preparing to cooperate in purchasing 150,000 jin of "Kehua" high-quality wheat seeds for widespread promotion next year to improve wheat yield and quality.

　　东北全区小麦丰收  平均收获八成年景
    改进农业技术是提高产量的有力保证
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北全区七十余万垧小麦，从七月中、下旬根据季节早晚先后动镰开割，现均收割完毕。
    今年东北小麦虽部分地区因遭了病害而稍有减产，但全区平均收获仍有八成丰收年景（前曾低估为七成，东北麦田常年只收六成左右）。如播种面积几占全区二分之一（三十二万垧）的黑龙江省，麦粒饱满为最近四、五年来所未有，平均七成年景；最低每垧平均可产小麦一千二百多斤，一垧比去年（常年）增产百斤以上。播种面积占全区第二位的松江省，今年小麦获“九一八”以来首次丰收，平均有八成年景；每垧产量平均为一千六百多斤，较去年（歉收）每垧四百五十斤增产二倍多。其他辽东、辽西、旅大等地之麦田，收成在八成到九成。这一成果的取得，除因雨水调和及耕作适宜外，贯彻了今年农业生产新方针——改进农业技术，是提高产量的有力保证。在春耕前各级人民政府领导进行一系列的选种、试种、种籽消毒、施肥等工作。如原占种籽中百分之三十的劣种油麦，经过精选后，清除了百分之十五。普遍试种的结果，提高了发芽率，黑龙江省讷河县经过试种的小麦，发芽率保住了百分之九十八。部分使用了“王铜”消毒地区，基本消灭了腥黑穗病。辽东省海城县有十二万亩小麦用“王铜”消了毒，从收成上估计比不消毒能多收二百万斤。同时东北人民政府在各推广区推广了二万二千垧“克华”等优良品种，不但质量好，在数量上亦比一般麦子多产百分之十五强。
    从麦收成果来看，证明了县、区领导农业生产干部重视与学习农业生产技术，为改进与推广农业生产技术主要关键之一。以使用“王铜”消毒为例，不少县区干部对东北人民政府或省人民政府印发的“王铜使用办法”小册子，反复进行了研究，向农民深入宣传，使农民按照规定的使用办法进行了消毒，收到了消灭腥黑穗病的效果，给农民留下了良好的印象。其次，由于从麦收成果上见到了改进农业技术的实效，提高了农民对改进农业技术的认识。在收割前各地即组织妇女、儿童等半劳动力，拔出了乌丹和油麦，在收割中各地都展开了群众性的选种运动，并在各级人民政府领导下，实行了单割、单打、单独保管，及互相进行了串换，以保证明年有足够的好种籽。黑龙江省农林、商业部并准备协同收购“克华”优良麦种十五万斤，以备明年普遍推广，提高小麦产量质量。
