How Dalian Electric Cement Plant Conducts Regular Production Emulation Drives
Xiao Feng

The regular production emulation drive at the Far East Electric Cement Plant is a crucial factor in the plant's continuous production improvement. The plant produced 42,998 tons of cement in 1947, 62,016 tons in 1948, and further increased to 76,800 tons in 1949, maintaining a consistently upward trend. The plan for 1950 is 120,000 tons. To celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the plant decided to strive to complete 120% of the annual production plan ahead of schedule by October 1st.

The plant's regular production emulation drive is based on different situations, proposing different requirements, and solving different problems. For example, from the end of 1947 to the end of 1948, the factory faced shortages of raw materials and fuel, sluggish sales, abnormal production, and confusion among workers' thinking, with serious wage-labor mentality and lax labor discipline. In response to these situations, a campaign to create model workers and merit achievers was launched. Especially during the May 1st Labor Day in 1948, a mass election of model workers was conducted, and criticism and self-criticism among workers were carried out, initially establishing a correct work attitude. The eighty-one model workers who emerged at that time became examples for all workers. After July 1948, workers not only stopped stealing factory tools but also brought back tools they had taken home in the past. At the same time, some systems were established during the competition, initially consolidating labor discipline. As a result, the plant was rated as a second-class model factory by Far East Electric Power.

Since 1949, the factory's production has approached full recovery, with ample supply of raw materials, normal production, and relatively high worker awareness. Therefore, the content of the production emulation drive has undergone significant changes. In the second half of 1949, the focus of the production emulation was to mobilize workers to actively propose rationalization suggestions and improve machinery and equipment. In 1949, one hundred and twenty rationalization suggestions were proposed, and one hundred and eight were adopted; in the first quarter of 1950, fifty-five rationalization suggestions were proposed. These rationalization suggestions not only directly and indirectly played a significant role in improving production, but also, the plant promptly proposed the slogan of creating model work units in the competition, shifting the competition from individuals to collectives.

How to Conduct Regular Production Emulation Drives

The reason why the cement plant's production emulation drive has never stopped is mainly because the competition revolves around the central task of the factory. Production emulations are organized by workshop and shift every quarter and month. The cement plant has an annual production plan, which is divided into quarterly production plans, with each quarter's plan being different. Due to the general production rules of cement plants, repair work is carried out in the first three months of each year, so formal production begins after April each year. At the beginning of each quarter, the production plan is brought to the party, government, and trade union meetings for discussion, studying what difficulties exist in completing production and how to solve them. After research, a production mobilization meeting is held, where each workshop launches a challenge competition. For example, in the first quarter of this year, they jointly proposed: "Welcoming May 1st Labor Day, striving to complete the half-year production task ahead of schedule" as the competition goal. Each workshop further divided its production tasks into monthly, weekly, and daily tasks, which were specifically communicated to the workers by the work unit leaders and the basic groups of the trade union production committee, so that each worker knew how much the production plan of their workshop was. At the same time, the workshop organized workers to launch production emulation drives between shifts. For example, the calcination work unit drew a chart of the production progress of each shift every day, so that workers could clearly see the production achievements of each shift. When the second shift saw that the first shift had produced 180 tons, they concentrated their efforts on maintaining the fire color to try to exceed 180 tons. In the whole plant, competitions between various workshops were organized to strive for the title of model work unit, and the competition between shifts became the foundation for ensuring the competition between work units. The cement plant also paid attention to combining major festivals with political education to conduct competitions, which further boosted the workers' production enthusiasm. Now the plant has put forward the slogan of striving to exceed 20% of the annual production task by October 1st. The experience of the cement plant proves that putting forward politically motivating slogans during festivals has a great effect on promoting regular competition.

How to Consolidate Regular Production Emulation Drives

How to make the competition consolidated is a very important organizational work. The cement plant used the following methods: 1. Publicity and mobilization. The publicity and mobilization work of the cement plant is diverse, including slogans, cartoons, honor rolls, honor lights, loudspeakers, dramas, etc., all of which powerfully cooperate with the competition and guide the workers to work in one direction. For example, when launching the rationalization proposal campaign, they adapted the story of how Zhu Jiagui made rationalization proposals into a drama for the workers to watch. The loudspeaker broadcasts production news to the whole factory every day, prompting other workshops to actively think of ways. For example, after the calcination workshop improved the ash spraying nozzle and increased production by 50 tons, it was broadcast in a timely manner, promoting the cement workshop to improve the pulverizing cylinder steel ball and increase production. Due to such continuous publicity, the atmosphere of the competition will not be depressed, and what the workers see and hear every day are mostly related to production emulation. 2. Regular evaluation. In addition to conducting wage evaluations every quarter, the evaluation committee of the plant's trade union regularly evaluates model work units and evaluates individual and collective rationalization proposals and new records at any time. Commendations are given with award flags and other means. Such timely evaluation and commendation greatly boosted the enthusiasm of the workers. 3. Material rewards. When the factory's production is on the right track and there are standards for production quotas, the factory uses competition and progressive piece-rate wages to encourage workers to improve production. For example, the progressive bonus is given to each workshop based on the shift, which greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for production. The workers said: "Increased production is good for the factory, we can also get model status, and we get more wages, who wouldn't work hard?!" Therefore, the improvement of production and the interests of the workers are closely related. For example, in 1949, production exceeded 192.1%, and the average income of workers exceeded 40%. This is the material basis for ensuring the plant's regular competition and consolidated development.

　　怎样进行经常性的生产竞赛
　　萧枫
    远东电业洋灰工厂的经常性的生产竞赛运动，是该厂生产不断提高的重要因素之一。该厂一九四七年生产洋灰四万二千九百九十八吨，一九四八年六万两千零十六吨，一九四九年更升到七万六千八百吨，产量始终保持直线上升。一九五○年计划是十二万吨，该厂为庆祝中华人民共和国诞生一周年，决定在十月一日争取提前完成全年生产计划百分之一百二十。
    该厂的经常性的生产竞赛运动，是根据不同的情况，提出不同的要求，解决不同的问题。如一九四七年末到一九四八年末，当时工厂原料、燃料缺乏，销路不畅，生产不正常，而且工人的思想混乱，存在着严重的雇佣观念，劳动纪律散漫。根据这些情况，开展了创造模范和立功运动，特别是在一九四八年五一劳动节，通过群众性的选举模范运动，开展了工人之间的批评与自我批评，初步树立了正确的劳动态度，当时涌现的八十一名模范，成为全体工人的榜样。一九四八年七月以后，工人们不但是不偷工厂的工具，反而把过去拿回家的工具，拿回工厂里来。同时在竞赛中，建立了一些制度，初步巩固了劳动纪律。因而该厂评为远东电业的二等模范工厂。
    自一九四九年开始，工厂的生产接近全面恢复，有了充足的原料供应，生产正常，工人觉悟比较高，因而生产竞赛的内容也就有了很大的转变。因而在一九四九年下半年，生产竞赛的中心，是发动工人们积极提出合理化建议，改进机械设备。在一九四九年提出一百二十件合理化建议，采纳的有一百零八件；一九五○年第一季提出合理化建议五十五件。这些合理化建议，不但是直接间接的对生产提高起了重大作用。同时，该厂在竞赛中，及时提出了创造模范职场的口号，使竞赛由个人走向集体。
    怎样开展经常性的生产竞赛
    洋灰工厂的生产竞赛运动，所以没有停止过，主要原因是竞赛围绕着工厂的中心任务。每季每月组织车间和班的生产竞赛。洋灰工厂有全年的生产计划，又分成每季的生产计划，而各季计划不同。因洋灰工厂一般的生产规律，在每年的头三个月要进行修补工作，因此正规的生产是在每年四月以后。每季的开始，将生产计划拿到党政工团的会议上进行讨论，研究在完成生产中有些什么困难，如何解决。经过研究之后，召开生产动员大会，会上各个车间则展开挑战竞赛。例如今年第一季，他们共同提出：迎接五一劳动节，争取提前完成半年生产任务的竞赛目标。各车间则把自己的生产任务更具体的分作每月的、每周的、每日的，由职场长和工会生产委员会的基础小组具体的向工人们进行传达，使每个工人们知道自己车间的生产计划是多少。同时在车间组织工人们展开班与班的生产竞赛。如烧成职场每日把各班的生产进度画出图表，使工人们个个很明显看出各班生产成绩。二班看到一班生产到了一百八十吨，他们就集中精力看好火色，争取超过一百八十吨。在全厂则组织了各个车间之间的竞赛，争取模范职场的称号，班与班的竞赛，则成为保证职场间竞赛的基础。洋灰工厂也注意结合重大节日，配合政治教育进行竞赛，更加鼓舞了工人的生产热情。现在该厂已提出在十月一日超过全年生产任务百分之二十而努力的口号。洋灰工厂的经验证明，在节日提出具有政治鼓动性的口号，对推动经常的竞赛，有很大作用。
    如何巩固经常性的生产竞赛
    如何使竞赛巩固下去，这是一个很重要的组织工作。洋灰工厂用了下面几个方法：一、宣传鼓动工作。洋灰工厂的宣传鼓动工作是多样性的，有标语、漫画、光荣榜、光荣灯、播音机、话剧等，都有力的配合了竞赛，并且是有中心的引导工人们向一个方向努力。如在开展合理化建议运动时，就将朱家贵怎样提合理化建议，编成戏剧演给工人们看。播音机每天向全厂广播生产捷报，促使其他车间也积极的想办法。如烧成场改进喷灰嘴子，增产五十吨后，就及时广播出去，推动了洋灰职场改进粉碎筒钢球，提高了产量。由于这样不断的宣传，使竞赛的气氛不致低落，工人们天天看到的和听到的，大都与生产竞赛有关。二、定期的评议。该厂工会的评议委员会除了每季的进行工资评议之外，就是定期评议模范职场，随时的评定个人的集体的合理化建议和新纪录。以奖旗等进行表扬。这样随时的评议和表扬，大大的鼓舞了工人们的积极性。三、物质奖励。当工厂生产走向正常，生产定额有标准，就用竞赛，用超额累进工资鼓舞工人们提高生产。如各个车间按班的进行累进奖励，就大大的鼓舞了工人们生产积极性，工人说：“生产提高了，对工厂有好处，我们还能得到模范，工资得的又多，谁还不好好干哪？！”因而生产的提高和工人们的利益是密切相关的。如一九四九年生产超过百分之一百九十二点一，工人的工资平均收入超过百分之四十多。这是保证该厂竞赛经常，巩固发展的物质基础。
