It protested against the U.S. government's intervention in Korea and its barbaric bombing of civilians, and believes that the Security Council, created to maintain peace, must condemn the U.S. aggression against Korea, order the U.S. government to immediately cease its air raids against the Korean people and withdraw its interventionist forces from Korea.

　　The Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee also sent a telegram to the Security Council, raising the same protest. The telegram stated: "We believe that any honest person, regardless of nationality, religion, or political party, must not remain silent in the face of the atrocities committed by the American aggressors in Korea."

　　The working people of the Romanian People's Republic, including democratic organizations such as the Executive Committee of the Mixed Trade Union of Medical Workers, the Jewish People's Democratic Committee, the Catholic Action Committee, and the Anti-Fascist Committee of Overseas German Nationals in Romania, also sent similar protest telegrams to the Security Council.
