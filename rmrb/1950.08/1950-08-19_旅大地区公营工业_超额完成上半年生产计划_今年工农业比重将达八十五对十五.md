    今年工农业比重将达八十五对十五
    【新华社大连十七日电】旅大地区公营工业上半年完成半年生产计划百分之一百十四点一。今年全年计划完成后，全区工业生产比重将达到占工农业生产总值的百分之八十四点九。上半年生产中，车辆、建筑器材、纺织染、油脂、食品工业的实际完成率，都超过原计划百分之二十以上；机械五金、日用品工业与渔、盐业超过百分之十以上。全区上半年主要产品的产量，较去年同时期都有显著增加。以机械五金工业为例，钢铁增加百分之二百五十八点五，钢材增加百分之一百六十九点四，铁棍增加百分之一百五十九点一。由于开展合理化建议、创造新纪录运动以及贯彻生产责任制的结果，工人劳动生产率已普遍提高。一月到五月，全区公营企业的劳动生产率平均超过原计划百分之十八点一。其中，旅大行署工业厅所属各厂矿的劳动生产率超过计划百分之三十三点五，今年第一季度较去年同季度则提高了百分之六十以上。劳动生产率的提高，是今年上半年各厂矿的生产成本费平均较原计划减少了百分之五点四七的主要因素。
