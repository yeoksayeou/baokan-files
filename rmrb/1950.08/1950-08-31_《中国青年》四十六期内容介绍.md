The central content of the 46th issue of "China Youth" concerns issues related to the mass line. "Stalin on the Mass Line" is a selection of several passages related to the mass line from Stalin's works, including three sections: "Confidence in the Creativity of the Masses," "Close Contact with the Masses is the Key to the Bolshevik Party's Leadership and Invincibility," and "The Party Should Have Deep-Rooted Ties with Its Class." The article "Talking About the Mass Line with Communist Youth League Members" explains why it is necessary to maintain close contact with the masses, what to use to connect with the masses, and also the need to oppose "commandism" and "tailism." "Miscellaneous Talk on the Mass Line in the Land Reform Movement" is written based on the author's experiences participating in the land reform movement. The commentaries in this issue include: "Opinions on Propaganda to Defend World Peace" and "After the Start of School." The "Study and Cultivation" column publishes "How to Systematically and Differentiately Eliminate the Feudal Exploitation System" (by Liao Luyan), and continues Zheng Chang's "Transforming Oneself." The "Communist Youth League" section includes "Some Extracurricular Activities of the Soviet Young Pioneers Combined with Regular Class Learning," "Study Well Yourself and Also Promote Others to Study Well" (the experience of the Harbin Municipal No. 2 Middle School Communist Youth League in promoting regular class learning), and "Why Do They Study Well?" and other articles. In addition, this issue also publishes the essay by Hyun Jung-min, Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Youth League: "The Korean People's Army is a Political, Technical, and Combat School for Korean Working Youth." "Current Affairs Chat" is titled: "The Revolutionary Movement of the Eastern People in the Past Five Years."

　　《中国青年》四十六期内容介绍
    《中国青年》第四十六期的中心内容是群众路线方面的问题。“斯大林论群众路线”是从斯大林的论文中选辑的与群众路线有关的数段，内有“确信群众的创造力”，“密切联系群众是布尔什维克党领导所以胜利不败的关键”，“党应当与本阶级有根深蒂固的联系”等三节。“和青年团员同志谈群众路线”一文，说明了为什么必须密切联系群众，拿什么去联系群众，又必须反对“命令主义”及“尾巴主义”的问题。“杂谈土地改革运动中的群众路线”，是根据作者参加土改运动的体验写成的。该期评论有：“保卫世界和平的宣传的意见”及“开学以后”。学习修养栏刊出“如何有步骤地有分别地消灭封建剥削制度”（廖鲁言作），并续完郑昌的“改造自己”。青年团一栏有“苏联少年先锋队结合正课学习的一些课外活动”，“自己学好，也推动别人学好”（哈尔滨市立二中青年团推动正课学习的经验），《他们为什么学习好？》等文。此外，本期并刊出北朝鲜民主青年同盟委员长玄正民的论文：“朝鲜人民军是朝鲜劳动青年的政治、技术、战斗的学校”。“时事漫谈”题为：“五年来的东方人民革命运动”。
