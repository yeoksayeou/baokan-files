Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Following the recent consecutive meetings of the North Atlantic Group and the Western European Union, the "Council of Europe," another Western European aggression organization, also recently convened in Strasbourg, France, to discuss how to implement the US imperialist's repeated orders for Western Europe to intensify its preparations for war. The progress of the meeting exposed the internal contradictions within the imperialist camp, especially those between the US and Britain.

The Council of Europe meeting was divided into two parts: one was the fifth meeting of the so-called "Committee of Ministers," the upper house of the organization, attended by the foreign ministers of thirteen countries, which opened on August 3rd and ended on August 9th; the other was the second annual meeting of the so-called "Consultative Assembly," the lower house of the organization, attended by one hundred and twenty-five parliamentarians from fifteen countries, which opened on August 7th and is still in progress.

At the meeting, the Committee of Ministers approved on the 5th the decision to allow West Germany and the Saar puppet government, which had so far only participated in the Consultative Assembly as associate members of the so-called Council of Europe, to attend the Committee of Ministers. It also passed a resolution urging the countries of the Council of Europe to support the US imperialist's war of aggression in Korea. However, the most important issue of the meeting, namely the further surrender of sovereignty by the countries to grant the Council of Europe the power of a Western European supreme government, was not resolved.

Belgian representative Spaak, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Consultative Assembly, made three demands to the Committee of Ministers: (1) abolish the existing veto power of each country in the Committee of Ministers and adopt a majority voting system; (2) expand the powers of the Consultative Assembly to undertake international parliamentary work; and (3) establish a European Affairs Department in each member state. However, all these demands were vetoed by the British representative at the meeting the following day. The representatives of France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, West Germany, and the Saar finally proposed a motion to establish a European political organization with limited obligations but clear powers, but it was also vetoed by Britain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. Agence France-Presse reported: "The continuous vetoes by Davies (representative of British Foreign Secretary Bevin) aroused dissatisfaction at the meeting. Some representatives claimed that the British government's attitude was 'shameful.'" "The ministers' failure to immediately approve these recommendations has been fiercely criticized by the Consultative Assembly lobby. Many representatives believe that unless the Consultative Assembly is given the power to act freely, this meeting will achieve nothing."

The disputes at the ongoing Consultative Assembly meeting are even more intense.

The first important issue discussed by the Consultative Assembly was the Schuman Plan report presented by French Foreign Minister Schuman on the 10th, authorized by the Committee of Ministers. France's original intention was to exert pressure on Britain, which had so far rejected the Schuman Plan, through the Council of Europe. However, on the day before Schuman presented his report, the Conservative group in the British delegation put forward a plan advocating that the Western European coal and steel industry be handed over to the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers, in which each country has veto power, for management, as a counterattack against the Schuman Plan's proposal to establish a supranational high-level co-management body. Therefore, Schuman clearly expressed his opposition to the Conservative Party's proposal in his report, pointing out that the Council of Europe is only a consultative body and has no real power, so it cannot be responsible for implementing the Schuman Plan. Schuman even openly demanded the so-called "overcoming of national egoism, antagonism, and narrow-minded views." After Schuman's speech, British representative Eccles immediately expressed his "surprise" that the French government, which had always supported the Council of Europe, had abandoned the Council of Europe and advocated the establishment of a separate high-level institution. In the subsequent debates, Britain strongly resisted this US plot to annex its coal and steel resources and markets. British Conservative MP Macmillan stated on the 15th: "Britain must not tolerate giving any supranational body the right to close mines or blast furnaces, thereby depriving people of their jobs."

The second important issue discussed by the Consultative Assembly was the rearmament of West Germany and the establishment of a unified Western European aggression army. As early as the 9th, British Conservative MP Boothby proposed that West Germany should formally participate in the Western European war group, and demanded the establishment of a joint supreme command for Western European countries and the establishment of a single supreme commander-in-chief. Boothby even claimed: "If West Germany does not participate, the defense of Western Europe will become impossible." On the 11th, French Independent Republican MP Reynaud even proposed: a Western European Allied Army should be organized, and a single "European Defense Minister" should be appointed. Reynaud believed that the candidate for this minister need not be sought outside the meeting, he hinted that it could be Churchill. On that very day, war-monger Churchill formally proposed at the meeting that the Consultative Assembly should call for the immediate establishment of a unified European army, which "should fully cooperate with the United States and Canada in action." In addition, Churchill also proposed: (1) Britain and France must supply a large number of troops on the continent in order to establish a "real line of defense" in the shortest possible time. (2) West Germany should be formally absorbed into the Western military alliance. (3) France must restore its "famous army troops."

However, Churchill's proposal was first met with strong opposition from the Labor group in his own delegation. Although the proposal was passed by a majority at the general assembly, all the representatives of the British Labor Party abstained. When this proposal was submitted to the General Affairs Subcommittee of the Consultative Assembly for discussion on the 15th, the British Labor representatives, with the support of the Scandinavian representatives, again emphasized that the European Consultative Assembly had no right to make any decisions on this issue. After a fierce debate, the committee had no choice but to decide to suspend the discussion temporarily.

The third important issue discussed by the Consultative Assembly was how to expand its own powers. Belgian representative Spaak had long proposed that since the Consultative Assembly had allowed representatives of member states to directly notify the parliaments of their respective countries of the important resolutions of the Consultative Assembly, it could therefore bypass the Committee of Ministers, which served as its upper house. However, this proposal was also opposed by the representatives of Britain and the Scandinavian countries. According to the Associated Press, their opinion was that the Consultative Assembly should "keep to its own business," should accept the task of a consultative body, and should not arbitrarily attempt to undermine the regulations that must be approved by the parliaments of the member states before they can be established.

The endless disputes have made representatives of some countries reluctant to continue the meeting. According to Reuters, representatives of several countries, including Britain, held a secret meeting on the 15th to discuss "how to end the meeting as soon as possible."

　　西欧侵略组织“欧洲委员会”的会议上
    帝国主义阵营内部争吵日烈
    对于《舒曼计划》及武装西德两问题，美英之间的矛盾增加了。
    【新华社十九日讯】继北大西洋集团与西欧联盟最近接连举行会议之后，西欧另一侵略组织“欧洲委员会”亦于最近在法国的斯特拉斯堡开会，讨论如何执行美国帝国主义最近一再逼迫西欧加紧备战的命令。会议的进程暴露了帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾，特别是美英之间的矛盾。
    欧洲委员会的会议分为两部分进行：一个是作为该组织上院的所谓“部长委员会”的第五次会议，有十三国的外交部长参加，于八月三日开幕，已于八月九日结束；另一个是作为该组织下院的所谓“咨询议会”的第二次年会，有十五国议会的一百二十五名议员参加，于八月七日开幕，现在仍在进行中。
    部长委员会会议于五日通过了迄今还只参加咨询议会的所谓欧洲委员会的襄助会员西德与萨尔傀儡政府得以列席部长委员会的决定，也通过了敦促欧洲委员会各国支持美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略战争的决定，但是，对于会议最主要的问题，即各国进一步放弃主权授予欧洲委员会以西欧太上政府权力的问题，却并没有得到解决。
    咨询议会常设委员会主席比利时代表斯巴克曾向部长委员会提出三点要求：（一）取消部长委员会内各国现有的否决权，而采取多数表决制；（二）扩大咨询议会权力，承办国际议会工作；（三）在每一会员国设立一个欧洲事务部。可是，所有这些要求，在后一天的会议上都被英国代表所否决。法、意、比、荷、西德与萨尔代表最后提出要求设立一个负有有限度的义务、但有明确权力的欧洲政治机构的动议，也被英国与瑞、挪、丹、冰各国所否决。法新社报道说：“会场对戴维斯（英外相贝文的代表）的连续否决发出不满之声。若干代表声称：英国政府的这种态度是‘可耻的’。”“部长们不能立即批准这些建议，已受到咨询议会院外活动团的猛烈抨击。许多代表认为，除非给咨询议会以自由行动之权，否则，本届会议将一无所获。”
    正在举行的咨询会议上，争吵更为剧烈。
    咨询议会讨论的第一个重要问题，是法国外长舒曼经部长委员会授权在十日提出的舒曼计划报告。法国的目的，原想通过欧洲委员会对迄今拒绝舒曼计划的英国施行压力，但是，在舒曼提出报告前一日，英国代表团中的保守党集团，即提出一项计划，主张把西欧煤钢工业交付各国有否决权的欧洲委员会部长委员会管理，以此作为对主张成立超国家高级共管机构的舒曼计划的还击。因此，舒曼在报告中明白表示反对保守党的建议，指出欧洲委员会只是咨询机关，并无实权，因此不能负实行舒曼计划的责任。舒曼更公然要求所谓“克服国家的自私主义、对抗主义和狭隘观点”。在舒曼发言以后，英国代表伊克里斯立即表示对于素来拥护欧洲委员会的法国政府竟然抛开欧洲委员会而主张另行成立高级机构“感到惊异”。在接着进行的多次辩论中，英国对于美国这一企图吞并其煤钢资源与市场的阴谋，进行了强烈的抵抗。英国保守党议员麦克米伦十五日声明：“英国决不能容忍给予任何超国家机构以封闭矿坑或鼓风炉，因而剥夺其工作的权利。”
    咨询议会讨论的第二个重要议题，是重新武装西德并建立统一的西欧侵略军的问题。还在九日，英国保守党议员布斯比即提出要使西德正式参加西欧战争集团，并要求建立一个西欧各国的联合最高司令部，设立单一的最高总司令。布斯比竟然声称：“如果西德不参加，西欧的防务就会成为不可能。”十一日，法国独立共和党的议员雷诺更提出：应组织西欧联军，并委任单一的“欧洲防务部长”。雷诺认为，这一部长的人选无须到会场以外去找，他暗示可以由邱吉尔来担任。就在这一天，战争贩子邱吉尔在会上提出了正式的提案，要求咨询议会号召立即成立一支统一的欧洲军队，这支军队“在行动时与美国和加拿大充分合作”。此外，邱吉尔又提出：（一）英法在大陆上必须供给大量军队，以便在尽可能短的时期内建立“真正的防线”。（二）吸收西德正式参加西方的军事同盟。（三）法国必须恢复其“著名的陆军部队”。
    但是，邱吉尔的提议首先遭到他本国代表团中工党集团的猛烈反对。这一提案在大会虽然以多数通过，但英国工党的代表却全数弃权。在这一提案于十五日提到咨询议会总务小组委员会讨论时，英国工党代表在斯堪的纳维亚各国代表的支持下，又强调提出欧洲咨询议会无权对这个问题作出任何决定。该委员会在激烈辩论之后，竟不得不决定暂时停止讨论。
    咨询议会讨论的第三个重要议题，是如何扩大本身权力的问题。比利时代表斯巴克很早即已提出：咨询议会既已使各会员国代表直接将咨询议会的重要决议通知各该国议会，因而，它即可以越过作为其上院的部长委员会。但是，这一提议也受到英国与斯堪的纳维亚各国代表的反对。据合众社称：他们的意见是：咨询议会应“守自己的本分”，应接受一个咨询机关的任务，而不应擅自企图破坏必须由会员国议会批准始能成立的规章。
    绵延不断的争吵，使若干国家的代表已经无心把会议继续开下去，据路透社消息称：包括英国在内的几个国家代表，曾于十五日举行秘密会议，讨论了“如何能使会议早日结束”的问题。
