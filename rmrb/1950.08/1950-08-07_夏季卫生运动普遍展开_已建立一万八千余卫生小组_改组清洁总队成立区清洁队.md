[Beijing News Agency] The summer hygiene campaign in Beijing has been widely launched. Sixteen district hygiene committees, five hundred and thirty-seven sub-committees, and eighteen thousand four hundred and eighty-five hygiene groups have been established throughout the city. The district hygiene committees have organized public and private medical personnel to carry out vaccinations, mobilize citizens to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, sweep up street and yard garbage, and establish sanitary conventions. In the 15th police station area of the 8th district, many citizens engage in the night soil business. After being mobilized by the hygiene sub-committee, manure factories and carts have been moved out of the city. Some night soil collectors, who do not have their own carts or factories, used to dump the collected night soil everywhere. After everyone came up with ideas, it was decided to dig pits themselves and cover them with tight lids. At 12 Miaoguangge, a large courtyard housing forty or fifty households, no one paid attention to public hygiene, and the courtyard was extremely dirty. After the hygiene group leader, Yin Gengxin, mobilized the masses to hold discussions, everyone came up with ways to supervise each other, transport accumulated garbage, stipulate that sewage must be poured into the sewers, and take turns cleaning the courtyard every day. Now it is much cleaner than before. Night food stall vendors in the Xisi South Street and Gangwashi areas of the Second District held a meeting to discuss and establish four sanitary conventions: (1) Food and utensils must be tightly covered with gauze. (2) Do not sell spoiled food. (3) Utensils should be cleaned frequently to keep them clean. (4) Be sure to wash your hands after defecating or urinating, and keep aprons and clothes clean. Fruit vendors in the area also established similar sanitary conventions and stipulated inspection methods. The Central Primary School in the Fourth District organized students from public and private primary schools in the district to catch flies, and has caught more than 170,000 flies. Some schools in the Second District have also mobilized students to make fly-catching equipment during labor classes. The Third District organized sixty-three units to conduct street propaganda on cholera prevention through lectures, question-and-answer sessions, and living newspaper plays.

[Further News] In order to further improve the cleanliness of urban streets and the collection of garbage from households, the Beijing Municipal People's Government reorganized the Cleaning Brigade under the Sanitation Engineering Bureau on the 21st and established district cleaning teams.

The average daily garbage production in Beijing's urban area is about 1,250 tons, with a total of 1,760 sanitation workers, averaging 0.7 tons of garbage removed per person per day. Thanks to the efforts of all members of the Cleaning Brigade over the past year, the percentage of daily garbage removed has increased from 45% before liberation to the point where daily garbage in the urban area is no longer accumulating.

    【京市新闻处讯】京市夏季卫生运动已普遍展开。全市已建立了十六个区卫生委员会、五百三十七个分会和一万八千四百八十五个卫生小组；各区卫生委员会组织了公私医务人员进行预防注射，发动市民灭蚊灭蝇，扫除街院垃圾，建立卫生公约。第八区第十五派出所辖境内很多市民经营粪业，经卫生分会动员后有粪厂粪车的都已迁出城外，一些自己没有粪车粪厂的粪夫过去掏回来的粪到处乱放，经大家想办法决定自己挖坑并用严密的盖子盖好；妙光阁十二号是一个住有四五十户的大杂院，谁也不注意公共卫生，院内极为肮脏，经卫生小组长尹耕莘发动群众开座谈会，大家想办法互相监督执行，运走积存垃圾，规定秽水一定要倒入水沟，每天轮流打扫院子，现在已经比从前干净多了。第二区西四南大街、缸瓦市一带夜饭摊商贩开会讨论，订立了四条卫生公约：（一）食品、用具用纱罩严密遮盖。（二）不卖腐坏食品。（三）用具经常擦洗保持干净。（四）大小便后一定要洗手，围裙衣服保持干净。该处水果摊贩也订立了类似的卫生公约，并规定了检查办法。第四区中心小学组织区内公私立小学学生捕蝇，已捕了十七万多头。二区有些学校并曾发动学生利用劳作课制做捕蝇器具。三区组织了六十三个单位用讲演、问答、活报剧等方式进行了预防霍乱的街头宣传。
    【又讯】京市人民政府为了进一步做好城区街道清洁及收集各户垃圾工作，已于二十一日将卫生工程局所属清洁总队改组，成立了区清洁队。
    京市城区平均日产垃圾约一千二百五十吨，共有清洁队员一千七百六十人，平均每天每人要运除垃圾○·七吨。一年来由于清洁总队全体人员的努力，已由解放前运除日产垃圾总数百分之四十五做到了城区日产垃圾不再积存。
