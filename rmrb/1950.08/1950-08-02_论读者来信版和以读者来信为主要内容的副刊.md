In recent months, following the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" and the News Administration's "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work," newspapers across the country have generally strengthened their work in connecting with readers and expanded the space devoted to publishing reader letters. Due to these meaningful improvements in newspapers, readers' political enthusiasm has significantly increased compared to a few months ago, criticism and self-criticism have begun to unfold, and this has provided considerable assistance to the work of the Party and the government.

However, after these improvements, there are still some issues that need to be resolved regarding reader letters sections and supplements primarily composed of reader letters.

First, although the editorial departments have attached importance to the work of publishing reader letters, demonstrating a cautious attitude towards readers' opinions, they have not frequently and seriously addressed the various important issues with ideological and principled significance raised in reader letters. Such issues include, for example:

	"Does opposing war mean opposing all wars?" (June 8th, this newspaper's "Defend World Peace Supplement," Q&A with readers)
	"Are atomic weapons terrible? Otherwise, why launch such a worldwide signature campaign to ban atomic weapons?" (Ibid.)
	"'Armed people opposing armed counter-revolution' is it a unique characteristic of the Chinese revolution?" (June 16th, this newspaper's "People's Mailbox")
	"Why defend peace?" (June 23rd, "Defend World Peace Supplement," Q&A with readers)
	"Why sign the peace declaration?" (July 3rd, "Defend World Peace Supplement," Q&A with readers)
	"Why is the United States obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan?" (July 7th, this newspaper's "People's Garden")
	"Is it in accordance with organizational discipline for Communist Party members to make criticisms and suggestions to the Party newspaper regarding government work?" (July 18th, "People's Mailbox")

When these questions are raised by readers, perhaps the wording is not very appropriate. As long as the editorial department adopts an enthusiastic and concerned attitude towards reader letters, keenly identifies and accepts readers' inspirations, it can certainly grasp the core of the issue and use appropriate wording to reveal the importance of the issue. However, we often prefer to answer these questions individually or not at all, and rarely answer them publicly in the newspaper. And the questions answered in the newspaper are often more fragmented. Of course, this is also because more important questions are often more difficult to answer immediately. However, it is inappropriate to let these questions go unanswered, without organizing research and answers on these questions, and allowing these questions to continue to exist among readers. Readers' questions, opinions, and creative initiatives raised to the editorial department should be regarded as a beneficial inspiration for the newspaper. It is the responsibility of the editorial department to be good at accepting this inspiration and providing answers or support through various appropriate means. Only when the editorial department fulfills this responsibility well, the content of the newspaper and reader letters can be further enriched under mutual influence.

Second, many newspapers have implemented the policy of making supplements primarily composed of reader letters, in accordance with the News Administration's "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work," thus giving these supplements a new look. However, the themes and content of reader letters published by newspapers across the country are still relatively narrow and not diverse enough. One of the reasons why reader letters are worth valuing is that they are an inexhaustible source of newspaper themes. The people of the whole country are in the midst of such a broad and upsurging movement of social reform and economic construction, and new things are constantly emerging in the lives of people everywhere. And reader letters, this reliable source for reporting new things, as long as it is diligently explored and fully and effectively utilized, will make the newspaper powerful and interesting. The current reality is that, on the one hand, the newspaper has encouraged critical letters from readers, exploring an exceptionally important part of this source; on the other hand, it has neglected the diversity of content and form of reader letters, has not or rarely explored other parts of this source, has not inspired readers to report on many moving events in the current great struggle, and has not adopted more diverse ways of handling reader letters.

The article "How Newspaper Editorial Departments Handle Workers' Letters," published in issues six and seven of this journal, provided a detailed description of the rich themes and diverse styles of reader letters. The author of that article pointed out that reader letters "should not only include critical materials, but also include positive materials." Taking the *Moscow Bolshevik Newspaper* as an example, the author wrote, "In the pages of this kind of newspaper, there are often letters of this kind, which record this kind of or that kind of positive facts. For example, in a letter under the title 'A Happy Trip,' the cultural services provided to passengers by the electric train from Moscow to Lamingtskoye are described in detail; in a letter 'They Have Returned to Work,' the attention of Soviet society to the honored veterans of the Patriotic War is discussed."

In the same essay, the examples listed by the author not only included many stories of readers criticizing the work of Soviet agencies, but also included many vivid facts of readers enthusiastically reporting on the situation in various places. He cited various ways in which Soviet newspapers published reader letters, and introduced the example of *Pravda*, saying that it can also be "widely cited in various articles, such as essays, reviews, vignettes, and sharp short commentaries on a specific fact."

If our editorial departments clearly recognize the diversity of the content and form of reader letters, learn to attract reader letters from various aspects, inspire readers in various ways, and publish and utilize letters in various different and fresh ways, they will be able to correctly implement the policy of making supplements primarily composed of reader letters, so that the newspaper will not become "dry and dull."

Third, newspapers should satisfy the literary and artistic demands of readers, should cooperate with all local writers, and strengthen their leadership over readers' cultural life. Most of our newspapers have always lacked literary and artistic taste. Not only are there few topics about literature and art in the commentaries, but they also create a rigid concept that manuscripts about literature and art can only be published in supplements. Therefore, after the supplements were changed to focus on reader letters, some of the literary and artistic manuscripts that previously had supplements as their only base were canceled. On the one hand, it is completely reasonable to cancel those literary and artistic manuscripts that are not sufficient to truly reflect the actual struggle of the people and replace them with vigorous and rich reader letters. However, it would be completely wrong to think that we can abandon the publication, introduction, and criticism of literary and artistic works by newspapers from now on.

Literature and art are one of the most important means to help the broad masses of people accept the education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Many readers hope to find the latest works of literature and art they need from newspapers, which are their daily reading materials. They demand to obtain popular explanations and principled and correct criticisms of literary and artistic works so that they feel satisfied in their cultural lives because they have leadership. Our country still has very few specialized newspapers in the field of literature and art. Our current newspapers must shoulder this task and should never give up leading readers' cultural life, nor should they refuse to satisfy readers' demands in literature and art.

Some newspapers, including this newspaper, publish a weekly or bi-weekly literary and art supplement and book review supplement. Most of these supplements are influential and have readers. However, they are not sufficient to meet the needs of readers. The literary and artistic activities of newspapers, like other news activities, should become a regular part of newspaper work. In the organizational structure of important Soviet newspapers, there are generally literary and artistic departments and book review departments. They do not concentrate literary and artistic and book review manuscripts to publish supplements, but instead, frequently publish them in any position on the second, third, or fourth page. They show great interest in domestic contemporary and historical writers, often sparing a large amount of space to publish their works or reviews of these works to meet the needs of readers. Although our newspapers do not have to abandon the special supplements on literature and art and books for this reason, or exclude texts on literature and art and books from the supplements for this reason, they should learn this spirit of valuing literature and art and cultural life.

Timely answering important questions raised by readers, striving to spread their beneficial initiatives, diversifying reader letters, improving the handling of reader letters, strengthening the leadership of readers' cultural life, and satisfying readers' literary and artistic demands are several important aspects of further improving newspaper work. We should be good at conducting extensive cooperation with readers, writers, critics, poets, directors, composers, artists, and film and theater workers, and fully utilize newspapers to work for the people.

### 论读者来信版和以读者来信为主要内容的副刊

　　论读者来信版和以读者来信为主要内容的副刊
    最近几个月以来，各地报纸按照中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”以及新闻总署“关于改进报纸工作的决定”，一般地加强了联系读者的工作，扩大了刊登读者来信的篇幅。由于报纸实行了这样的有意义的改进，读者的政治积极性较之几个月以前业已相当的提高了，批评和自我批评初步地展开了，从而也对党的和政府的工作给了不少的帮助。
    但是经过这样一些改进以后，读者来信版和以读者来信为主要内容的副刊还有一些需要解决的问题。
    第一是编辑部虽然重视了发表读者来信的工作，表现了对读者意见的慎重的态度，但是没有经常地认真处理读者来信中所提出的各种有思想性原则性的重要问题。这样的问题，例如：
    “反对战争，是不是说一切战争都要反对？”（六月八日本报“保卫世界和平专刊”答读者问）
    “原子武器可怕吗，否则为什么要发动这样一个全世界要求禁用原子武器的签名运动呢？”（同上）
    “‘武装的人民反对武装的反革命’是不是中国革命独具的特点？”（六月十六日本报“人民信箱”）
    “为什么要保卫和平？”（六月二十三日“保卫世界和平专刊”答读者问）
    “为什么要在和平宣言上签字？”（七月三日“保卫世界和平专刊”答读者问）
    “美国为什么阻挠对日和约的缔结？”七月七日本报“人民园地”）
    “共产党员向党报提出对政府工作的批评和建议，是否合于组织纪律？”（七月十八日“人民信箱”）
    当这些问题从读者中提出的时候，也许提法并不是很适当的，只要编辑部抱着热心的和关切的态度来对待读者来信，敏锐地辨明和接受读者的启示，就一定可以捉住问题的中心，用适当的提法使问题的重要性显露出来。但是，我们对于这些问题往往宁愿个别作答或没有答复，很少是在报纸上公开作答的。而在报纸上答复的问题，又常是比较零碎的。当然，这也由于比较重要的问题往往比较难于马上答复。然而因此便放过这些问题，不组织关于这些问题的研究和解答，让这些问题继续在读者中存在着，是不妥当的。读者对编辑部提出的问题，意见和创造性的倡议，应当看作读者对报纸的一种有益的启示。善于接受这种启示，通过各种适当的方式予以解答或支持，是编辑部的责任。只有编辑部很好地履行了这种责任，报纸和读者来信的内容才有可能在相互影响之下进一步丰富起来。
    第二，有许多报纸已经按照新闻总署“关于改进报纸工作的决定”的提示，实行了副刊以读者来信为主要内容的方针，因而使这些副刊获得了新的面目，但是各地报纸所发表的读者来信的题材内容还是比较狭窄的，还是不够多方面的。读者来信之所以值得重视，原因之一也由于它是报纸题材的无尽藏的源泉。全国人民处在目前这样广泛的、高涨的社会改革和经济建设运动中，新鲜事物正在一切地方的人民生活中不断产生。而读者来信，这个报道新鲜事物的可靠的来源，只要勤于发掘，并加以充分而有效的利用，便将使报纸成为有力量的和有兴味的。现在的事实是，报纸一方面鼓励了来自读者中的批评性的信件，发掘了这个源泉的异常重要的一部分；另一方面却忽视了读者来信的内容和形式的多样性，没有或很少发掘这个源泉的其他部分，没有启发读者来对目前伟大斗争的许多动人事件进行报道，也没有对读者来信的处理采取更多样的方式。
    本刊第六、七期所载《报纸编辑部怎样处理劳动者的来信》一文，曾经对读者来信的丰富的题材和多样性的体裁作了详尽的说明。那篇文章的作者指出，读者来信“不仅应当包括批评性的材料，而且应当包括积极性的材料”。以《莫斯科布尔什维克报》为例，作者写道，“在这一种报纸的篇幅上，常有这样的信件，其中记载着这一种或那一种积极性的事实。例如，在一个‘愉快的旅行’的标题下的来信中，详细叙述了从莫斯科到拉岷斯考耶的电气列车对于乘客们的文化服务的情形；在一件‘他们已回来工作’的来信中，谈着苏维埃社会对于卫国战争的荣誉军人的注意。”
    在同一论文中，作者所列举的例子也不仅包括了许多读者批评苏维埃机关工作的故事，而且包括了许多读者热情地报道各地情况的生动的事实。他举出苏联报纸发表读者来信的各种各样的方式，并介绍《真理报》的例子说，还“可以广泛地引用于各种文章中，如论文、述评、小品、对于一种具体事实的锐利的短评”。
    我们的编辑部如果清楚地认识了读者来信的内容和形式的多样性，学会从多方面吸引读者来信，用各种办法给读者以启发，并且用各种不同的、新鲜的方式发表和利用来信，便能正确地执行副刊以读者来信为主要内容的方针，使报纸不致流为“干巴巴的”。
    第三，报纸应当满足读者的文学艺术的要求，应当与当地所有的作家合作，加强对读者文化生活的领导。我们的大多数报纸一向比较缺少文学艺术趣味，不但评论中很少关于文学艺术的题目，而且自己制造一种僵硬的观念，以为关于文学艺术的稿件只能在副刊上发表。因此，在副刊改以读者来信为主要内容以后，一部分过去以副刊为唯一地盘的文学艺术的稿件被取消了。从一方面说，取消那些并不足以真正反映人民实际斗争的文学艺术的稿件，而代之以生气蓬勃、内容丰富的读者来信，是完全有理由的。但是，以为从此可以放弃报纸对文学艺术作品的发表、介绍和批评，那就是完全错误的。
    文学艺术是帮助广大人民接受马列主义和毛泽东思想教育的最重要的手段之一，很多读者希望能从作为日常读物的报纸上找到为他们所需要的文学艺术的最新作品，他们要求获得关于文学艺术作品的通俗的解释和原则性的正确的批评，使他们在自己的文化生活中因为有领导而感到满足。我国还很少文学艺术方面的专门性报纸，我们现在的报纸必须担负这个任务，决不应当放弃对读者的文化生活的领导，也决不应当拒绝在文学艺术方面满足读者的要求。
    有一部分报纸，包括本报在内，都出版着一种每周一次或每两周一次的文艺专刊和书评专刊。这种专刊大部分是有影响、有读者的。但是，不够满足读者的需要。报纸的文学艺术的活动，应当与其他新闻活动一样，成为报纸工作的经常的一部分。在苏联重要报纸的组织机构中，一般都设有文学艺术部和书评部，他们不是把文学艺术和书评稿件集中起来出专刊，而是经常地登在第二、第三或第四版的任何一个地位上。他们对本国现在的和历史上的作家都表现出很大的兴趣，常常不惜用大量的篇幅来刊载他们的作品，或关于这些作品的评介，以满足读者的要求。我们的报纸虽然不必因此而放弃关于文艺和图书的专刊，或因此而将关于文艺和图书的文字排除于副刊之外，却应当学习这种重视文艺和文化生活的精神。
    及时地解答读者所提出的重要问题，努力传播他们的有益的倡议，使读者来信多样化，改善读者来信的处理方法，加强对读者文化生活的领导，满足读者的文学艺术方面的要求，这就是进一步改进报纸工作的几个重要的方面。我们应当善于与读者、作家、批评家、诗人、导演、作曲家、美术家和影剧工作者进行广泛的合作，充分地运用报纸为人民而工作。
