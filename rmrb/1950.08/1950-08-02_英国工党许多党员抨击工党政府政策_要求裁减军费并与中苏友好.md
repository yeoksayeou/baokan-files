Xinhua News Agency, London, August 30th, via Telecommunication Agency: Dissatisfaction with the government's policies is growing among many ordinary Labour Party members, especially since the outbreak of the Korean War. Recently, a Labour MP held a meeting in a rural constituency where twelve people spoke, ten of whom vehemently attacked the government's policy on Korea. At a recent meeting of the Fabian Society in Central London, attendees almost unanimously supported the People's Republic of China's participation in the Security Council. A Labour Party branch in Northwest London bitterly complained that many members had left the party one after another due to dissatisfaction with Labour's policies. In a Labour Party branch in South London, four members of the management committee resigned.

Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: Before the Labour Party's annual conference is held from October 2nd to 6th, a large number of Labour Party members have put forward motions one after another, condemning the Labour government's domestic and foreign policies.

The three hundred proposals submitted by local Labour organizations regarding the Labour Party's policy program were published on the 25th. According to a London dispatch from the Telecommunication Agency: "For the first time, these proposals reveal how widespread criticism, anxiety, and astonishment among the lower-level members of the British Labour Party towards the British Labour Party government's imperialist and war-mongering policies are."

The Telecommunication Agency also reported: Among the three hundred proposals, twenty-seven were proposals on foreign policy put forward by Labour Party organizations at all levels and various trade unions. These twenty-seven proposals all condemned the British government's foreign policy in the most激烈的论调 (extreme terms) and demanded a thorough change in foreign policy. At least ten proposals demanded the destruction and prohibition of atomic bombs. While the British government is about to increase combat expenditures again, various Labour Party branches have submitted several proposals to the Labour Party conference demanding an immediate and drastic reduction in military spending. The Labour Party branch in Uxbridge proposed that the government "end participation in the Cold War and adopt a policy based on friendship with the Soviet Union and its allies." The Labour Party branch in Cirencester made the same request, saying: "The maintenance of world peace and the full benefit of the peaceful development of atomic energy depend on Britain revising its foreign policy, which must include more friendly relations and cooperation with the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the People's Republic of China." The Labour Party branch in Spennymoor stated: "The constant threat of war—mainly made by those who do not have to fight but can profit from war—is completely contrary to the government's previously announced labor and trade union movement policies. We do not want to massacre people of other nationalities or races; we advocate a policy of peace, goodwill, and friendship towards all mankind."

Regarding domestic policy, the proposals also severely criticized the Labour Party government. Among the forty-eight proposals on prices and profits, forty strongly condemned the government for allowing profits and prices to rise while continuing to freeze wages.

　　英国工党许多党员抨击工党政府政策
    要求裁减军费并与中苏友好
    【新华社三十日讯】电通社伦敦二十五日讯：许多普通的工党党员对政府的政策的不满，特别是在朝鲜战争发生以来更有发展。最近，一位工党议员在某一农村选区召开了一次集会，会上有十二个人发言，其中有十人猛烈地攻击政府对朝鲜的政策。伦敦中区费边社最近一次的集会，与会者几乎一致地支持中国人民政府应参加安全理事会。伦敦西北区一个工党支部沉痛地诉怨说，许多党员因为不满工党的政策，接二连三地脱党了。在伦敦南区一个工党支部里，管理委员会有四个委员辞了职。
    【新华社三十日讯】英国工党的广大党员群众，在十月二日至六日举行工党年会之前，已纷纷提出议案，斥责工党政府的内政外交政策。
    工党地方组织对工党政策纲领所提的三百件提案，已于二十五日发表。据电通社伦敦消息指出：在这些提案中，“首次揭露出英国工党下层党员对英国工党政府所采取的帝国主义和战争贩子的政策的批评、焦虑和惊愕是如此的广泛”。
    电通社消息又称：在三百件提案中，有二十七件是工党各级组织和各工会所提关于外交政策的提案。这二十七件提案，都以最激烈的论调斥责英国政府的外交政策，并要求外交政策的彻底改变。提案中要求销毁并禁止原子弹的，至少有十件。当英国政府正将再度增加作战费用的时候，各工党支部向工党大会却提出几件要求立即剧减军备费用的提案。阿克斯布利治的工党支部的提案，要求政府“终止参加冷战，并采取以和苏联及其盟邦的友谊为基础的政策”。西伦塞斯特的工党支部提出同样的要求说：“世界和平的维护与获取原子能的和平发展的充分利益，有赖于英国修改其外交政策，这一政策必须包括和苏联、东欧及中华人民共和国保持合作的更友好的关系。”斯波桑工党支部的要求称：“经常作战争的威胁——主要是那些自己不必打仗但可从战争中渔利的人们所作的——完全违背政府前所宣布过的劳工和工会运动政策。我们不想屠杀其他国籍或种族的人们，我们拥护对所有人类保持和平、善意和友谊的政策。”
    关于国内政策，各提案对工党政府也严予抨击。关于物价和利润的四十八件提案中，有四十件强烈抨击政府一方面允许利润和物价上涨，同时又继续冻结工资。
