　　Unrealistic Plans and Negligent Execution: Hengyang Railway Bureau Fails to Meet Targets in the First Half of the Year
    [Hengyang News] Although the Hengyang Railway Administration Bureau's transportation efficiency in the second quarter showed significant improvement compared to the first quarter, the bureau only completed 86% of its freight transportation target for the first half of the year, 86.8% of its passenger transportation target, and its operating revenue only reached 71.6% of the original target.
    The reasons for the bureau's failure to meet its targets for the first half of the year are primarily unrealistic plans, miscalculations, and the excessively low transportation efficiency in the first quarter. The unrealistic planning and calculation errors within the bureau are inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of its leadership, which is detached from the masses and unaware of the actual situation. During the planning meeting held in Beijing at the end of last year, the bureau failed to propose realistic plans, and aside from the number of loaded cars, turnover rate, transfer stop time, and empty car rate, the overall plan was set too high. During implementation, there was also a lack of diligence and responsibility. For example, freight cars used for military transport were included in the number of loaded cars, but the business side did not issue freight tickets or calculate the number of passengers.
    In response to the above shortcomings, the bureau has clearly stated that it must implement the policy of relying on workers to improve production, earnestly implement democratic management, continue to deeply combat bureaucratic and commandist work styles, promote production competitions, continue to improve transportation efficiency, and establish normal transportation order; develop sources of goods, increase income, and lay a favorable foundation for launching a new record movement and reducing costs next year.

### 计划不切合实际执行不认真  衡阳路局上半年未完成任务

　　计划不切合实际执行不认真  衡阳路局上半年未完成任务
    【衡阳讯】衡阳铁路管理局第二季运输效率较第一季虽有很大进步，但该局上半年货运仅完成任务百分之八十六，客运完成任务的百分之八十六点八，营业收入仅达原任务百分之七十一点六。
    该局没有完成上半年任务的原因，主要是计划不切合实际，计算错误和第一季运输效率过低。该局计划不切合实际及计算中发生错误，是和该局领导上脱离群众，不了解实际情况的官僚主义作风分不开的。去年年底在北京开计划会议时，该局没有提出切合实际的计划，除装车数、周转率、中转停站时间及空车率以外，总的计划是订高了。在执行的时候，又不够认真负责，如军运使用货车列入装车数，而营业方面既未起货票，也未计算客运人数。
    针对以上缺点，该局已明确提出：必须贯彻依靠工人搞好生产的方针，认真实行管理民主化，继续深入反官僚主义、反命令主义作风，推动生产竞赛，继续提高运输效率，建立正常运输秩序；开辟货源，增加收入，为明年展开新纪录运动、减低成本打下有利基础。
