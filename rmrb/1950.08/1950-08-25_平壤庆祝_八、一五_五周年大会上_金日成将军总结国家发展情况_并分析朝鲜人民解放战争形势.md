　　Comrades! Brothers and sisters! It has been five years since our motherland was liberated from the long-term colonial rule of Japanese imperialism by the force of the great Soviet army.

　　Today, all the Korean people are welcoming their national holiday – the fifth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation – in an environment where they are waging a just war of liberation against the armed intervention of US imperialism and its running dog, the traitorous Lee Seung-man clique, to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of our motherland. Our brave officers and soldiers of the People's Army and male and female guerrillas, in the fierce battles with the invading troops of US imperialism and its running dog, the Lee Seung-man puppet army, are displaying unparalleled heroism and bravery, gloriously defending the independence and freedom of our motherland, and liberating the southern half of our motherland and the people of the southern half from the ravages of the bandit US imperialism and its running dog, the Lee Seung-man gang. Our workers, peasants, staff members, intellectuals, patriotic entrepreneurs, merchants, and handicraftsmen have reorganized all the work in the rear to suit the wartime environment in order to ensure the victory of the front, subordinating everything to the interests of the front, exerting unprecedented patriotic, dedicated, and creative efforts, and launching a production increase movement, fruitfully meeting the increasing needs of the front. Today, whether it is the soldiers at the front or the people in the rear, when they welcome their national holiday – the fifth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation – they all have the same belief: that they must eliminate and expel the armed invaders who invaded our motherland's territory – the invading troops of US imperialism and its running dog, the Lee Seung-man puppet army – from the territory of our motherland as soon as possible, in order to end our just war of liberation with a final victory.

　　**North Korea, with the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union, launched a solemn democratic construction work**

　　We welcome the fifth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation in this environment. In order to further deepen our understanding of the legitimacy of our cause, we need to summarize (even if it is simple) the path that the southern and northern halves of our motherland have taken in the five years since liberation.

　　Ladies and gentlemen! After the "August 15th" liberation, all the Korean people were faced with the task of: restoring the motherland as an independent country, developing our country under democratic principles, eradicating the long-term rule of Japanese imperialism as soon as possible, developing industry, agriculture, and national culture, in order to build a strong, unified, democratic, and independent country.

　　In order to put this important task into practice, it is necessary to consolidate every corner of the liberated entire Korea. People's Committees established according to the will of the people must guarantee freedom of speech, publication, and assembly; organize and strengthen democratic social organizations such as trade unions, farmers' alliances, democratic youth leagues, and democratic women's leagues; implement land reform, nationalize factories, manufacturing plants, railways, mines, banks, etc. owned by Japanese imperialism and national traitors; rapidly restore damaged factories and enterprises to improve the people's material and cultural living standards; cultivate cadres necessary for managing the country; establish a democratic education system; and expand, strengthen, or newly establish school institutions, etc.

　　However, the Korean people can only practice this task in North Korea, where the great Soviet army is stationed. In South Korea, where the American army is stationed, this task cannot be practiced.

　　After the great Soviet army drove out Japanese imperialism from the territory of our motherland, it created all the conditions for the Korean people to be able to restore and develop their own country into an independent country and rebuild the country on a democratic basis with their own strength. In the five years since liberation, the northern half of our motherland, with the selfless and sincere assistance of the great Soviet Union, has launched a solemn democratic construction work.

　　Through several democratic elections, the truly people's power organs – the People's Committees – have been consolidated and developed. Various democratic reforms such as land reform and industrial nationalization have been implemented. Tens of thousands of national cadres have been cultivated. As a result of the solemn democratic construction carried out in the northern half in the five years since liberation, the people's economy has been rapidly restored and developed, the people's material and cultural standards have been significantly improved, and national culture and national art have been rapidly developed.

　　The industrial production volume in the northern half of the Republic in 1949 increased to about four times that of 1946. Machinery production increased to about one and a half times that of 1944. After the land reform, the rural economy sector also achieved great results. The sown area increased significantly. The total grain production in 1949 increased to 120.9 percent of that in 1944 (i.e., before liberation). Thus, the northern half of the Republic has changed from a food-deficient area to a self-sufficient area.

　　Speaking of the education sector: in 1949, the number of people's schools had increased to 18 times that of 1944, and the number of students had increased to 17 times; the number of junior high schools had increased to 20 times, and the number of students had increased to 23 times; the number of various specialized schools had increased to 12 times, and the number of students had increased to 10 times; especially in the five years since liberation, 15 new universities have been established, whereas before liberation there was not a single university.

　　Ladies and gentlemen! This simple figure marks the summary of the solemn democratic construction work carried out in the northern half of our motherland in the five years since liberation.

　　The achievements made by the Korean people in the northern half of our motherland in the short period of five years since liberation are enormous. The reason why we have been able to achieve such enormous achievements is, first of all, because the force of the great Soviet army liberated the Korean people from Japanese imperialist colonial rule, and because the great Soviet people gave the Korean people sincere friendship and assistance. Therefore, when all the Korean people welcome the fifth anniversary of liberation, they extend their national congratulations and gratitude to the great Soviet people and the leader of the working people of the world, the savior of the Korean people – Marshal Stalin.

　　**From the first day of entering South Korea, the United States has planned to colonize Korea**

　　However, in the southern half of the Republic, a completely opposite situation has been created in the five years since liberation. From the first day of entering the southern half of our motherland until today, the United States has consistently implemented its long-prepared plan, which is to colonize our motherland, enslave our people, and turn the territory of our motherland into a base for its aggression in the Far East.

　　The first thing the Americans did when they came to the southern half of our motherland was to suppress and disband the truly people's power organs – the People's Committees – that were established after the "August 15th" liberation according to the will of the Korean people, and restore the ruling institutions of the Japanese imperialist era. In the past five years, the US imperialists, in alliance with all reactionary forces such as pro-Japanese factions and national traitors, have established a police violence system in the southern half of our motherland, suppressed all patriotic and democratic political parties and social organizations, forced them to go underground, and, through their running dog – the Lee Seung-man gang, have imprisoned and murdered hundreds of thousands of outstanding patriots of our motherland.

　　The economy of the southern half of our motherland has been completely occupied by it in the five years of US imperialist rule. Our national industry has been completely destroyed. The number of enterprises in the southern half in the first half of 1949 fell to 36 percent of that in 1943, the era of Japanese rule. In particular, the production of the machinery industry has fallen to 5 percent. The rural economy of the southern half of our country has been on the road to bankruptcy in the past five years. The cultivated area in 1949 was reduced to 55 percent of that before liberation, and the harvest was reduced by 5 million *seok*. The forced collection of food and the forced purchase of grain laws have made the lives of farmers even poorer.

　　In order to enslave the Korean people, the US imperialists implemented colonial enslavement education, obliterated the traditions of our national culture, and adopted measures to encourage corrupt Western-style "culture."

　　The US imperialists instigated the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang to establish a military police fascist system in the southern half of our motherland. Measures have been implemented to massacre all patriotic and democratic forces. As revealed in the course of the war, the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang turned the southern half of our motherland into a living hell of torture and abuse. The gang massacred more than 37,000 people in Jeju Island alone, turning hundreds of villages into ashes.

　　In the course of the war, the truth that the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang massacred thousands of people in Incheon, Suwon, Daejeon, Chungju, Gongju, Gangneung and other places was exposed, and the crime of burning hundreds of rural areas and villages was discovered.

　　In the past five years, the various policies implemented by the US imperialists in the southern half of our motherland have been policies of colonial subordination, policies of national division, and policies of preparing to launch a civil war. The political and economic situation created in the southern half of our motherland in the five years since the "August 15th" liberation can be briefly described as above. (⑴⑷)

　　**US imperialism premeditatedly attacked North Korea to achieve its looting goals**

　　Although our people have lived in different conditions in the past five years, our goals are the same. The territory of our motherland is a whole, and our nation is also one nation. Therefore, whether it is the Korean people in the southern half or the northern half, in the past five years, they have consistently opposed US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man bandits, and have continuously launched struggles for the unification, independence, and democracy of the motherland. However, the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang finally ignited the flames of war in our motherland.

　　Ladies and gentlemen! The Korean people never expected this war. All the patriotic and democratic forces in our country have continuously struggled with possible plans to achieve the peaceful unification of the motherland. However, the Lee Seung-man traitorous bandits, under the direct manipulation of US imperialism, unexpectedly launched an armed attack on the area north of the 38th parallel on June 25, provoking a fratricidal civil war in our motherland. US imperialism, with the goal of realizing predatory aggression, violently interfered in our motherland's internal affairs, mobilized its long-prepared army, navy, and air force, and launched an armed attack on our motherland's territory and our territorial waters.

　　US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man traitorous bandits have long and meticulously prepared for this war. This can be easily seen from the appearance of many so-called "important figures" in the Lee Seung-man puppet government who participated in the so-called "Northward Expedition," the continuous provocation of conflicts along the 38th parallel with a large military force concentrated along the 38th parallel before the war, and the so-called "clearing the rear" carried out for the purpose of war. As evidenced by the many secret documents seized by our People's Army in Seoul and the statements issued by the so-called "important figures" and many "members of the National Assembly" of the Lee Seung-man puppet government who have already surrendered, the war provoked by the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang was prepared under the instruction of US imperialism and the direct command of the US military advisory group stationed in Seoul. However, what goals did the Lee Seung-man traitorous bandits and US imperialism attempt to achieve in this war? The Lee Seung-man traitorous bandits attempted to implement the anti-people reactionary police rule system existing in the southern half of our motherland in the northern half of our motherland through this war, eliminate the people's democratic system that has been established in the northern half of our motherland, massacre a large number of outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland, deprive the Korean people of the various democratic rights and freedoms they have already obtained, plunder the various achievements of democratic reform, and vainly attempt to maintain their crumbling territory. The reason why the Lee Seung-man traitorous bandits provoked this war was to implement the instructions of their American masters, turn our motherland into a colony of US imperialism, and turn our Korean people into slaves of US imperialism. Why did US imperialism invade our motherland and violently interfere in our internal affairs with military actions, bombard our peaceful cities and rural areas, and massacre our brothers and sisters? That is because US imperialism, which vainly attempts to dominate the world, wants to make our motherland its permanent colony, as its military strategic base in Asia, and wants to turn our people into its slaves. US imperialism does not recognize the Korean people's right to freedom and independence, and does not regard the Korean people as human beings, believing that the Korean people only have the fate of being slaves. Therefore, from the day our motherland was liberated from Japanese imperialist rule until the very end, US imperialism has consistently despised the Korean people's indomitable aspirations for building a democratic and independent country, and has done everything possible to hinder its practice. As revealed in the course of the war, US imperialism, with the purpose of creating a pretext for armed intervention in our motherland, manipulated the Lee Seung-man traitorous bandits to provoke a fratricidal civil war in our motherland, and even attempted to realize its brutal aggressive plans in other regions of Asia. They launched an armed invasion of our motherland in order to realize the brutal plans of American war provokers, the plans to make the United States move towards militaristic fascism in the future, and the brutal plans to make the countries subordinate to the United States even more subordinate to US imperialism. US imperialism clamors that its open aggressive act against our country is based on a "police" action of the "Security Council decision" that cannot deceive even a three-foot child. They attempt to cover up their aggressive acts with the illegal decisions of the Security Council passed without the participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the representatives of the two major permanent members of the Security Council – the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. However, the progressive people of the world are very clear about the purpose of US imperialism's armed aggression against Korea. Therefore, the statements clamored by the American war merchants – that the American army is only performing "police duties" in Korea in the name of the "United Nations" – cannot deceive anyone.

　　**American robbers steal the United Nations flag to massacre the Korean people and destroy production enterprises**

　　The US armed invasion of Korea has abused the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law. The United Nations organization was created for the sake of lasting world peace and security, not for US imperialism to use it as a predatory aggression to invade other countries' territories, trample on the independence and freedom of other nations, and make them their colonial slaves. The United Nations organization was not created for US imperialist armed invaders to use it as an instrument of aggression, to armedly interfere in our motherland's civil war, to send land, sea, and air forces to indiscriminately bomb our peaceful cities and rural areas, to destroy production enterprises made with the blood and sweat of the Korean people, and to indiscriminately drop bombs on the heads of peaceful residents, women, and children to massacre them, attempting to make our nation its colonial slaves. However, American robbers are now raising the flag of the United Nations and carrying out a robber-style armed intervention against our country under the signboard of the so-called United Nations army. The air force units of American robbers daily carry out barbaric indiscriminate bombing of many cities and villages in the northern half of the Republic, such as Nampo, Pyongyang, Wonsan, and Hungnam, in order to destroy the production enterprises, cultural facilities, and residences that the people of the northern half of the Republic have overcome all difficulties to restore and construct in the five years since liberation; and indiscriminately bomb and massacre peaceful residents, women, and children. American robber air force groups and fleets have continued to bomb many cities and villages in the southern half of the Republic, including Seoul, for days. The enemy's fleet continues to carry out bestial shelling of coastal cities and coastal areas. Such indiscriminate bestial bombing has turned many cities, villages, and fishing villages in the southern half, such as Dongducheon, Uijeongbu, Suwon, Daejeon, Chungju, Gongju, Gangneung, and Jumunjin, into ruins, and thousands of peaceful residents have lost their homes and wandered the streets, or have been killed or injured. The US air force units and fleets have destroyed our country's industries with barbaric bombing, massacred our people on a large scale, and brought the fate of poverty to our Korean people. They systematically destroy peaceful enterprises that have no connection with military targets and have never produced military supplies, blindly bombard densely populated areas, and even indiscriminately bomb farmers who are weeding in the fields, women who are washing clothes by the river, and students who are studying in schools. MacArthur's headquarters proudly reports on the bestial acts of indiscriminately bombing our peaceful cities and rural areas and dropping hundreds of tons of bombs on the heads of peaceful residents, and shamelessly clamors that this is a good deed for the Korean people.

　　**The Korean People's Army, with the support of the whole country, liberated nine-tenths of the vast area of the South**

　　This barbarous act of US imperialism has aroused the anger and hatred of all the Korean people, prompting all the Korean people to rise up and participate in the war of liberation to win the independence, freedom, and honor of the motherland. When US imperialism provoked the war in our Korea, it underestimated the infinite power of the Korean people and the armed power of our People's Army, which is fully supported and supported by all the Korean people.

　　Our People's Army, with the support of all the Korean people, in just one and a half months after turning to the counter-offensive, liberated nine-tenths of the vast area of the southern half of our motherland and the people who account for about 92 percent of the total population of the southern half. Our heroic People's Army, in the fierce battles with the enemy, has liberated the entire Ongjin Peninsula and Namyeonbaek County, the entirety of Gyeonggi Province, South Chungcheong Province, North Chungcheong Province, South Jeolla Province, North Jeolla Province, and South Gangwon Province, and part of South Gyeongsang Province and North Gyeongsang Province. It is currently continuing to launch a bold battle to liberate the remaining areas of South Gyeongsang Province and North Gyeongsang Province. In the course of the battle, our heroic People's Army killed nearly 30,000 enemy troops, wounded and captured more than 40,000 enemy troops, and seized a large number of war trophies. Our People's Army had already annihilated the basic main force of the Lee Seung-man puppet army, and gave a great blow to the US ground forces, fleets, and air force units headed by the US 24th Division; and fruitfully launched a bold battle to completely wipe out and expel the last soldier from the territory of our motherland. Now, our People's Army has been tempered in the course of the battle, has accumulated more combat experience, and is becoming a stronger army. Our various branches of the military, in the offensive battles and brutal counter-offensive battles to destroy and wipe out the enemy, are displaying unparalleled heroism, bravery, and patriotic dedication. Our brave and glorious infantry, tank soldiers, and artillery soldiers, in the river-crossing operations to break through the enemy's defensive positions along the Imjin River, the Han River, the Geum River, and the Nakdong River, in the offensive battles to pursue the enemy across the rugged mountains and high ridges, and in the bayonet fighting, have demonstrated tenacity, endurance, bravery, and noble fighting spirit. Our infantry and tank soldiers' bayonet fighting has terrified the enemy and led them to the dead end of destruction. Our young air force and fleet bravely fought without hesitation against enemy planes and fleets that outnumbered themselves, shot down many enemy planes, stopped the enemy fleet from invading, and defended our coast. The heroism, bravery, and patriotic dedication displayed by the various branches of our People's Army in the just war of liberation to resolutely defend the independence, freedom, and honor of the motherland is infinitely great. Many officers and soldiers of the People's Army have been awarded the Republic's highest honor – the title of Hero, and tens of thousands of officers and soldiers will also be awarded military merit medals and badges.

　　Therefore, all the Korean people have unlimited trust and love for the People's Army. (Applause).

　　**The People's Army fights for the independence and freedom of the motherland and receives the support of the whole country and the people of the world**

　　What is the reason why our young People's Army defeated the US imperialist armed invaders and the Lee Seung-man puppet army and won victory? The reason why our People's Army won victory is first and foremost because they know what they are fighting for and for whom. Unlike the American mercenary executioners who fight for dollars and to enslave other nations, the People's Army fights for the independence and freedom of their own motherland, against the American aggressors and their running dogs. Every officer and soldier of the People's Army knows very well for whom they are fighting. The Korean people, who have directly experienced the painful life of Japanese imperialist long-term colonial rule for 36 years, and who have directly experienced the rights, freedom, and various achievements of democratic reform in the northern half of the Republic in the five years since liberation, are unwilling to act as colonial slaves again, and absolutely do not want to give up the various rights of democratic reform that they have won to anyone. Today, every officer and soldier of our People's Army knows very well in the battle against the American armed invaders and the Lee Seung-man puppet army that they must resolutely defend the independence, freedom, and honor of their own motherland in order to solve the fate of our nation and the future of future generations. Therefore, the patriotism and hatred for the few burning in the hearts of our soldiers have become an endless source of bravery and heroism in the struggle. The victory of our People's Army lies in the fact that its struggle is constantly aided and supported by the entire people. History proves that an army that is supported and supported by the people has never failed. All the Korean people oppose US imperialism's armed intervention in our country, and have unanimously risen up to dedicate all their energy, intelligence, and material resources to support the People's Army. Our People's Army has its own solid rear. In the northern half of the Republic, more than 800,000 young people have volunteered to join the army. In the southern half of the Republic, approximately 400,000 workers and peasants have petitioned to join the volunteer army and the People's Army guerrillas. The people of the southern half of our motherland, which has already been liberated, warmly welcome the People's Army everywhere, and, risking bombing, repair bridges and roads and transport the People's Army's food and military supplies to support the attacking People's Army. The brave guerrillas of the southern half, in the fierce struggle with the enemy, fear no sacrifice, resolutely defend the independence and freedom of the motherland and the rights of the people, persist in the brave struggle, respond to the People's Army's attack, and strengthen and expand their activities in the enemy's rear. All these facts show how much the entire Korean people support and support their own armed forces – the People's Army, and show where the source of the People's Army's victory lies. The reason for the People's Army's victory also lies in the fact that our glorious People's Army is fully armed with advanced technology and can effectively utilize its technology. Finally, the reason why our People's Army has achieved victory is because it has received the international sympathy and support given to the Korean people by the People's Republic of China, the people's democratic countries, and the freedom-loving people of the world, headed by the Soviet Union. This sympathy and support has further encouraged the Korean people, who have risen up to resolutely defend the independence and freedom of the motherland, and has given them unlimited confidence and strength in victory. On the contrary, the invading army of US imperialism, which is conducting an armed invasion against our motherland and our people, is completely the opposite. What are the American soldiers fighting for in this war? The American mercenaries are fighting for dollars and for the interests of US imperialism, which is attempting to colonize our country. They are now fighting in a foreign territory far from their own country. Therefore, it is not surprising that these American invading troops cannot be supported by the people of their own country and the progressive mankind of the world. In every corner of the world, the call for "Withdraw from Korea" issued by hundreds of millions of people is getting louder and louder. It is no coincidence that this call is gradually resounding throughout the United States. Therefore, the American armed aggressors, who cannot obtain the support of their own people and the progressive mankind of the world, are bound to fail in the predatory war of aggression against our motherland and our people. Undoubtedly, the Korean people, who are waging a just war for the independence, freedom, and honor of their own motherland, will surely achieve victory.

　　**The war of liberation has entered a decisive stage; the front and the rear should double their efforts for victory**

　　However, comrades! Victory does not come by itself. It must be achieved by overcoming all difficulties and going through fierce battles with the enemy. In order to win victory in the just war against the US imperialist armed aggressors and their running dog, the Lee Seung-man traitorous bandits, the front and the rear should be united as one. We must consolidate the victories we have already achieved and organize new victories. The victories that our heroic People's Army has already achieved at the front are enormous. But this does not mean that we have achieved the final victory, nor does it mean that the American armed aggressors will honestly withdraw from the territory of our motherland. There has never been a historical fact that imperialist plunderers have rolled out without being dealt a decisive blow. The more the enemy's intentions of aggression are frustrated, the more they will carry out a final struggle. Having been defeated repeatedly by the offensive of the heroic People's Army and compressed into the narrow areas of South and North Gyeongsang Provinces, the American invading troops and the remaining Lee Seung-man puppet army are carrying out a beastly struggle in order to save their fate of facing destruction. Therefore, today we should recognize that the war to drive out the enemy from the last area of our country has entered a more fierce and serious decisive stage. Our heroic People's Army and all the people should eliminate and wipe out the enemy remaining on the territory of our country, and dedicate double the efforts and mobilize all our strength to expel the enemy.

　　The heroic People's Army joint units and detachments must destroy and wipe out the enemy; do not give the enemy time to breathe; do not allow the enemy's new ground forces to land; continue to attack! Attack Busan and Jinhae!

　　The commanders and officers of our People's Army must learn the art of military leadership well; they must command their own troops well, command the troops swiftly and mobilely, carry out bold operations to encircle the enemy; and they should be creative in battle.

　　Brave People's Army soldiers should be more proficient in their weapons, cherish their weapons, do not waste ammunition and bombs; be good at collecting seized weapons, ammunition and bombs, and use them to annihilate the enemy; under the conditions of air strikes, be good at sheltering themselves and their troops, weapons and military supplies; be good at firing accurate shots at the enemy; and display double the bravery, patriotic dedication and offensive spirit.

　　The rear staff should ensure that weapons, ammunition and other military supplies are reasonably and non-wastefully continuously supplied to the front; protect military supplies well in air strikes; correctly sort out and utilize the seized war trophies; quickly restore damaged equipment; and ensure continuous supply work to the front.

　　The people in the rear, in order to quickly end the war and win the final victory, must defeat the enemy, spare no effort, and support the heroic People's Army fighting for the independence, freedom, and honor of the motherland.

　　Mobilize all resources and materials to serve the needs of the front; subordinate all the undertakings in the rear to the interests of the front; conserve equipment, raw materials, and food; supply more materials, military supplies, and food to the front; launch an unprecedented production increase movement and dedicate creative efforts. Under the slogan of "Everything for the front" and "Everything for the victory of the front," all the forces in the rear should be dedicated to the front to ensure victory.

　　Workers in the rear must produce more coal, steel, iron, weapons, and military supplies; quickly restore factories and manufacturing plants destroyed by enemy bombing and put them into operation; increase production speed doubly to meet the requirements of the front; and protect their factories and manufacturing plants from bombing.

　　**Eliminate the American invaders and their running dogs; final victory will surely belong to the Korean people**

　　Farmers must supply more food to the front and the rear, and more raw materials to industry; do not fear air strikes, and protect your harvests well; launch a movement to increase the production of agricultural products. Farmers in the liberated areas should fruitfully implement land reform according to the principles of uncompensated confiscation and uncompensated distribution; cherish the land owned by themselves, and ensure timely weeding and autumn harvest to ensure more harvest; quickly restore roads and bridges so that the People's Army is not hindered in the offensive.

　　Workers and staff in the southern half must quickly restore the production enterprises destroyed by the enemy, quickly restore railways, bridges, transportation, and communication organs to meet the requirements of the front and ensure the agility of the work in the rear. Know that the people of the southern half, who have been liberated by the force of the People's Army, are now no longer slaves groaning in oppression and suppression as in the era of Lee Seung-man, but are masters of their own motherland.

　　The people of the southern half must restore their own organs of power – the People's Committees – everywhere; unanimously participate in the elections of the People's Committees. Elect your own outstanding representatives so that the People's Committees can restore the destroyed economy of the southern half as soon as possible, improve the people's lives, revive culture, and ensure the faithful implementation of the national task of supporting the attacking People's Army.

　　Guerrillas active in the enemy's rear must actively launch their activities in response to the attacking People's Army; cut off the enemy's rear transportation lines; raid the enemy in the enemy's rear; destroy port facilities to stop the landing of new ground forces of American armed invaders; and destroy more military supply warehouses; raid the enemy's staff headquarters.

　　The enemy is very ferocious and full of treachery. All the people in the rear must maintain military secrets, prevent enemy infringement; defend their factories, rural areas, and hometowns, and be vigilant against the enemy. Wage a merciless struggle against rumour mongers, escapees, and saboteurs; and discover and punish spies and secret agents in a timely manner.

　　All the people must end our just struggle for the independence, freedom, and honor of the motherland with the final victory as soon as possible. The final victory belongs to the Korean people who have risen up for the just war! Everything must be subordinate to the interests of the front. All the people must support and support the attacking People's Army, and quickly destroy and expel the armed aggressors of US imperialism and their running dog, the Lee Seung-man gang. Let us bravely advance to win victory!

　　My motherland was liberated from the long-term colonial rule of Japanese imperialism by the force of the great Soviet army! Long live the fifth anniversary of "August 15th"!

　　Glory belongs to the Korean people and their armed forces – the heroic People's Army – who have risen up to participate in the just war of liberation against the armed aggressors of US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man traitorous bandits, for the independence, freedom, and honor of the motherland!

　　Glory belongs to the heroic officers and soldiers of the People's Army and male and female guerrillas who sacrificed themselves in the just war of liberation to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of our motherland!

　　Long live the unified Korean people!

　　Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

　　Long live our liberator – the great Soviet people and their wise leader, the savior of the Korean people, our closest friend – the great Marshal Stalin!

    各位！“八、一五”解放后，在全朝鲜人民的面前摆着：复兴祖国为独立国家、在民主的原则下发展我国，早日肃清日本帝国主义长期统治的恶果，发展工业、农业、民族文化，以建设富强的统一的民主独立国家的任务。
    为了实践这一重要任务，就需要巩固解放后的全朝鲜的每一个角落。根据人民的意志而建立起来的人民委员会，必须保障言论、出版、集会的自由，组织并加强职业同盟、农民同盟、民主青年同盟、民主妇女同盟等民主的社会团体，必须实施土地改革，把日本帝国主义和民族叛徒所有的工厂、制作所、铁道、矿山、银行等收归国有，迅速恢复被破坏的工厂、企业，以提高人民的物质、文化、生活水平，并应培养管理国家所必要的干部，建立民主的教育制度，扩大、加强或新设学校机关等。
    但是，朝鲜人民只能在伟大苏联军队所驻屯的北朝鲜实践这一任务。在美国军队所驻屯的南朝鲜，就无法实践这一任务了。
    伟大的苏联军队在我祖国疆土上赶走日本帝国主义后，就给朝鲜人民创造了能够用自己的力量来复兴与发展自己国家为独立国家、在民主的基础上重建国家的一切条件。我祖国的北半部在解放后五年间，在伟大苏联的大公无私的真挚援助下，展开了庄严的民主建设工作。
    通过数次民主选举，巩固与发展了真正的人民政权机关——人民委员会。实施了土地改革和产业国有化等各种民主改革。培养了数千数万的民族干部。由于北半部在解放后五年间展开了庄严的民主建设，结果使人民经济有了迅速的复兴和发展，人民的物质文化水平得到了显著的提高，民族文化和民族艺术有了迅速的发展。
    共和国北半部的工业生产量，在一九四九年度就增长到一九四六年度的约四倍。机械生产约增至一九四四年度的一倍半。土地改革以后，农村经济部门也取得了极大的成果。播种面积显著地增加。一九四九年谷物的总生产量增加到一九四四年（即解放前）的百分之一百二十点九。于是，共和国北半部从食粮不足的地带转变为能够自给自足的地带了。
    再说一说教育部门：一九四九年人民学校的数目已增加到一九四四年的十八倍，学生增加到十七倍；初级中学增加到二十倍，学生人数增加到二十三倍；各种专门学校数目增加到十二倍，学生增加到十倍；特别是在解放后五年间，新设了十五所大学，在解放以前是一所大学都没有的。
    各位！这一简单的数字，就标志着解放后五年间，在我祖国北半部展开的庄严的民主建设工作的总结。
    在解放后五年的短时期内，朝鲜人民在我祖国北半部取得的成果是巨大的。我们所以能取得这种巨大的成果，首先是因为伟大苏联军队的武力，使朝鲜人民从日本帝国主义殖民地统治中获得解放，是因为伟大的苏联人民予朝鲜人民以真挚友谊援助的缘故。所以全朝鲜人民在迎接解放五周年纪念日的时候，向伟大的苏联人民和全世界劳动人民的领袖、朝鲜人民的解放救星——斯大林大元帅致以全民族的祝贺与感谢。
    美国从进驻南朝鲜头一天起即有计划地将朝鲜殖民地化
    但在共和国南半部，解放后五年间却造成了完全相反的情势。美国从进驻我祖国南半部的头一天起直到今天，一贯地实施着他们早有准备的计划，即是使我祖国殖民地化，奴役我们人民，变我祖国疆土为他们侵略远东的基地的计划。
    美国人到我祖国南半部所作的第一件事情，就是镇压和解散在“八、一五”解放后根据朝鲜人民的意志所建立起来的真正的人民政权机关——人民委员会，恢复了日本帝国主义时代的统治机构。美帝国主义者在过去的五年间，联合亲日派、民族叛徒等一切反动势力，在我祖国南半部树立警察暴力制度，镇压一切爱国的民主政党、社会团体，迫使其转入地下，并通过他们的走狗——李承晚匪帮监禁与残杀了我祖国优秀的爱国者数十万名。
    我祖国南半部的经济，在美帝国主义统治的五年中，完全被它霸占了。我们民族的产业完全被破坏了。南半部企业所的数目在一九四九年上半年，降落到日本统治时代的一九四三年的百分之三十六。特别是机械工业的生产，竟降落到百分之五。我南半部的农村经济在过去五年中，走向了破产的道路。一九四九年的耕种面积减少到解放前的百分之五十五，收获量减少了五百万石。强迫征收粮食和强购粮谷法，使农民的生活更加贫穷了。
    美帝国主义者为奴役朝鲜人民，实施了殖民地奴化教育，抹煞了我们民族文化的传统，采取了鼓励腐败的洋式“文化”的办法。
    美帝国主义者唆使李承晚卖国匪帮在我祖国南半部树立了军事警察的法西斯制度。实施了屠杀一切爱国民主力量的办法。正如在战争过程中所暴露的一样，李承晚卖国匪帮把我祖国的南半部变为拷打与虐杀的活地狱。匪帮们仅在济州岛就虐杀了三万七千余人，使数百个村落变成灰烬。
    在战争的过程中，李承晚卖国匪帮在仁川、水原、大田、忠州、公州、江陵等地惨杀数千数万人民的真相暴露出来了，烧光数百个农村与村庄的罪恶被发现了。
    在过去的五年当中，美帝国主义者在我们祖国南半部所实行的各种政策，是使我祖国殖民地隶属化的政策、分裂民族的政策、并且是准备发动内战的政策。“八、一五”解放后的五年当中，在我祖国南半部所造成的政治经济的形势简单说来即如上所述。（⑴⑷）
    美帝国主义为实现掠夺目的有准备地对北朝鲜实行进攻
    我们人民在过去的五年中，虽在各种不同的条件下生活着，但我们的目的是同样的。我们祖国的疆土是一个整体，我们的民族也是一个民族。所以不论南半部或北半部的朝鲜人民，在过去的五年中，一致反对美帝国主义与李承晚匪徒，为了祖国的统一、独立、民主，曾不断地展开斗争。但李承晚卖国匪帮终于在我祖国燃起了战争的火焰。
    各位！朝鲜人民绝没有期望这一战争。我国的全部爱国民主力量，为实现祖国的和平、统一，曾以可能的方案不断地进行斗争。但李承晚卖国匪徒在美帝国主义的直接操纵下，于六月二十五日对三八线以北地域开始了意外的武装进攻，在我祖国挑拨了同族相残的内战。美帝国主义者以实现掠夺的侵略为目的，横暴地干涉我们祖国的内政，动员了早已准备好的陆、海、空军，对我祖国疆土和我国领海开始了武装进攻。
    美帝国主义者和李承晚卖国匪徒从早就周密地准备了这一战争。这从李承晚傀儡政府中参与所谓“北伐”的许多“要人”的出现，在战争前即以庞大兵力集中于三八沿线，继续不断地挑拨三八线冲突事件，以及所谓以战争为目的而进行的“肃清后方”等事实中，就能很容易地看出。正如我们人民军队在汉城所缴获的许多秘密文件，和业已自首的李承晚傀儡政府的所谓“要人”及许多“国会议员”所发表的声明所证明的一样，李承晚卖国匪帮所挑起的战争，是在美帝国主义者的指使下和曾驻在汉城的美国军事顾问团直接的指挥下早有准备的。然而，李承晚卖国匪徒和美帝国主义者在这一战争中企图达到什么样的目的呢？李承晚卖国匪徒企图通过这一战争，把我祖国南半部存在着的反人民的那个反动警察统治制度，实行于我祖国北半部，消灭已在我祖国北半部创立了的人民民主制度，大量屠杀祖国优秀的儿女，剥夺朝鲜人民业已取得的各种民主权利和自由掠夺民主改革的各种成果，并妄想维持自己走向崩溃的地盘。李承晚卖国匪徒所以挑起这一战争，为的是实行自己美国主子的指示，将我祖国变为美帝国主义的殖民地，使我朝鲜人民变为美帝国主义者的奴隶。美帝国主义者为什么侵犯我祖国，并以军事行动来横暴地干涉我国内政，轰炸我们和平的城市与农村，屠杀我们的兄弟姊妹呢？那是因为妄图独霸世界的美帝国主义者想使我祖国永久作它的殖民地，作为它在亚洲的军事战略基地，想把我们人民变成它的奴隶。美帝国主义者不承认朝鲜人民自由、独立的权利，并把朝鲜人民不当人看待，认为朝鲜人民只有作奴隶的命运。所以，美帝国主义者从我祖国由日本帝国主义统治下获得解放的那一天起直到最后，一贯地蔑视朝鲜人民为着建设民主、独立国家的不屈不挠的夙愿，并千方百计地妨害其实践。如同在进行战争的过程中所暴露的一样，美帝国主义者以制造对我祖国进行武装干涉的口实为目的，操纵李承晚卖国匪徒在我祖国挑起同族相争的内战，甚至对亚洲的其他地域，也企图实现自己凶暴的侵略计划。他们对我祖国发动武装侵犯，为的是实现美国战争挑拨者的凶暴的计划，使美国今后走向军国主义法西斯化的计划、把隶属于美国的各国更加隶属于美帝国主义者的凶暴计划。美帝国主义者叫嚣说，它对我国公开施行侵略行为，是基于连三尺童子也骗不了的“安理会决定”的“警察”行为。他们企图以没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加及安理会两大常任理事国——苏联与中华人民共和国代表参加而通过的安理会的非法决定，来掩盖他们的侵略行为。但是全世界的进步人民很清楚地知道美帝国主义者对朝鲜的武装侵犯的目的。所以，美国战争贩子叫嚣的声明——即美国军队在朝鲜以“联合国”的名义，只执行“警察职权”而已——是欺骗不了任何人的。
    美国强盗窃取联合国的旗帜屠杀朝鲜人民毁坏生产企业
    美国对朝鲜的武装侵犯，滥用了联合国宪章和国际公法的各项原则。联合国组织，是为了世界的持久和平与安全而创设的，并不是为了使美帝国主义者利用它作为侵犯他国的领土、蹂躏其他民族的独立与自由、以及使他们作为自己殖民地奴隶的掠夺性的侵略而创设的。联合国组织，并不是为了使美帝国主义武装侵犯者利用它作为侵略工具，武装干涉我祖国内战，派遣陆、海、空军滥炸我们的和平城市及农村，破坏用朝鲜人民的膏血造成的生产企业，并向和平居民妇女及儿童的头上滥投炸弹屠杀他们，企图使我民族作其殖民地奴隶而创设的。但是，美国强盗们现正举起联合国的旗帜，在所谓联合国军的招牌下，对我国进行强盗式的武装干涉。美国强盗们的空军部队，对南浦、平壤、元山、兴南等共和国北半部许多城市和乡村，每日进行野蛮滥炸，以破坏在解放后五年间共和国北半部人民克服一切困难，恢复与建设起来的生产企业、文化设施及住宅；并对男女老幼和平居民，进行滥炸虐杀。美国强盗的空军机群及舰队，对以汉城为首的共和国南半部的许多城市和乡村，连日继续加以轰炸。敌人的舰队对海岸城市及海岸地区继续滥施兽性的炮击。如此无差别的兽性轰炸，使东豆川，议政府、水原、大田、忠州、公州、江陵、注文津等南半部许多城市、乡村及渔村变成废墟，数千数万的和平居民失去住宅彷徨街头，或被杀伤。美空军部队及舰队以野蛮轰炸破坏我国的产业，大规模的虐杀我人民，给我朝鲜人民招来贫困的命运。他们有计划地破坏与军事目标毫无任何关系的、从未进行过军需品生产的和平企业，盲目炸射人烟稠密的地区，甚至对在田地里锄草的农民、在河边洗衣服的妇女、在学校读书的学生也滥施炸射。麦克阿瑟总部洋洋得意地报道着滥炸我国和平城市和农村以及向和平居民的头上投掷数百吨炸弹的兽行，并厚颜无耻地叫嚣说这是对朝鲜人民的善行。
    朝鲜人民军在全国的支援下解放南部十分之九广大地区
    美帝国主义者的这一蛮行，激起了全朝鲜人民的愤怒和憎恨，促使全朝鲜人民奋起参加争取祖国的独立、自由及荣誉的解放战争。美帝国主义者在我们朝鲜挑起战争时，过低估计了朝鲜人民无穷的力量和我们受着全朝鲜人民充分支持和声援的人民军队的武装力量。
    我们的人民军队，在全朝鲜人民的支持下，转入反攻后不过一个半月之间，就解放了我祖国南半部地区十分之九的广大地区和约占南半部总人口百分之九十二的人民。我们英勇的人民军队在与敌人进行残酷的战斗中，已解放了瓮津半岛及南延白县全部、京畿道、忠清南道、忠清北道、全罗南道、全罗北道、南江原道的全部以及庆尚南道、庆尚北道的一部地区。现正在为解放庆尚南道、庆尚北道的残余地区继续展开着果敢的战斗。在战斗过程中，我们英雄的人民军击毙敌军近三万余名，击伤及俘虏敌军达四万余名，并缴获战利品甚多。我们的人民军早已歼灭李承晚伪军的基本主力，予美军第二十四师为首的美军地面部队、舰队以及空军部队以莫大的打击；有成果地展开着从我祖国疆土上完全扫荡与驱逐他们最后一兵的果敢的战斗。现在，我们的人民军在战斗过程中受到了锻炼，积累了更多的战斗经验，正在变为更坚强的军队。我们的各兵种部队，在击灭与扫荡敌人的进攻战和残酷的反攻战中，发挥着无比的英勇性、勇敢性和爱国的献身性。我们勇敢的荣誉的步兵、坦克兵及炮兵，在突破临津江、汉江、锦江、洛东江等敌人防御阵地的渡河作战中，在越过峻险的山脉及高岭追击敌人的进攻战中，在铣钢战中，发挥了强韧性、忍耐性、勇敢性以及高尚的战斗性。我们的步兵和坦克兵的铣钢战，使得敌人为之恐怖，并促使他们走向灭亡的死路。我们的年青空军和舰队，与数量上超过自己的敌机和敌舰队毫不犹疑地勇敢作战，击落了许多敌机，制止敌舰队的侵犯，捍卫着我们的海岸。我们人民军各兵种部队，在为坚决保卫祖国独立、自由与荣誉的正义解放战争中所发挥的英勇性、勇敢性及爱国的献身性，是无限伟大的。许多人民军官兵都荣获共和国的最高荣誉——英雄称号，数万的官兵也将荣获军功奖章及勋章。
    因此，全朝鲜人民对人民军有着无限的信赖与爱护。（鼓掌）。
    人民军为祖国独立与自由而战获得全国和全世界人民的支援
    我们年青的人民军队击溃美帝国主义武装侵犯者与李承晚伪军，获得胜利的原因在那里呢？我们人民军获得胜利的原因，首先在于他们知道为了什么、为了谁打仗。人民军不像美国雇佣兵屠杀者似的为美元、为奴役其他民族而打仗，而是为自己祖国的独立与自由、反对美国侵略者及其走狗而打仗。人民军的每个官兵都很清楚地知道为谁战斗。三十六年来直接体验到日本帝国主义长久殖民地统治的痛苦生活，又在解放后五年当中在共和国北半部直接体验到人民的权利、自由与民主改革各种成果的朝鲜人民，不愿再充当殖民地奴隶，并且绝不愿把自己所争取的民主改革的各种权利让给任何人。今天我们每个人民军官兵在反对美国武装侵犯者与李承晚伪军的战役中，很清楚地知道要坚决捍卫自己祖国的独立、自由与荣誉，以便解决我民族的命运及后代的将来问题。所以，在我们战士的内心燃烧着的爱国主义和对数人的憎恨，成为斗争中的勇敢性和英雄性的无尽的泉源。我们人民军的胜利是在于它的斗争受着全体人民不断的援助和支持。历史证明受人民的支持和声援的军队是从来没有失败过的。全朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义对我国的武装干涉，并一致奋起献出自己的全部精力、智力、物力，声援着人民军队。我们人民军拥有自己巩固的后方。在共和国的北半部，已有八十余万名的青年志愿参军。在共和国的南半部，已有四十余万名左右的工人、农民请愿参加义勇军和人民军游击队。业已解放的我们祖国南半部的人民，在各处狂热地欢迎着人民军，并为支持进攻中的人民军，冒着轰炸，修复着桥梁和道路，搬运着人民军的食粮和军需物资。英勇的南半部人民游击队队员们在和敌人进行残酷斗争中，不怕牺牲，坚决保卫着祖国的独立和自由及人民的权利，坚持着勇敢的斗争，响应人民军的进攻，在敌人的后方加强并扩大着自己的活动。这一切事实说明了全朝鲜人民是何等地支持与声援自己的武装力量——人民军，说明了人民军胜利的源泉在何处。人民军胜利的原因还在于我们光荣的人民军充分地以先进的技术武装起来，并且能够有效地利用其技术。最后，我们人民军取得胜利的原因，是因为它受着以苏联为首的中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家和全世界爱好自由的人民所给予朝鲜人民的国际的同情和声援。这种同情和声援更加鼓舞了为坚决保卫祖国的独立和自由进行荣誉的正义斗争而奋起的朝鲜人民，给予他们以对胜利的无限信心和力量。而反对我们祖国和我们人民，进行武装进犯的美帝国主义者的侵略军队，却完全与此相反。美国的军人在这次战争中为了什么而战争呢？美国的雇佣兵是为美元而作战，为企图将我国殖民地化的美帝国主义的利益作战。他们现在离开自己遥远的国家来到他国的领土上作战。所以这些美国侵略军队不能受自己国内的人民和全世界进步的人类的支持，是不足为奇的。在全世界的每一个角落，数亿人民所发出的“撤出朝鲜”的呼声愈来愈高。这一呼声逐渐响彻美国，也不是偶然的事情。所以，不能取得其国内人民支持和全世界进步人类支持的美国武装侵略者，在反对我们祖国和我们人民的掠夺的侵略战争中，是一定要失败的。无疑地，为自己祖国的独立、自由和荣誉，进行正义战争的朝鲜人民必将取得胜利。
    解放战争已进至决定性阶段  前线后方应为胜利加倍努力
    可是，同志们！胜利并非是自己来到的。而是必须克服一切难关，经过和敌人进行残酷的战斗才能取得的。为了在反对美帝国主义武装侵略者及其走狗李承晚卖国匪徒的正义战争中争取胜利，前线和后方应打成一片。须巩固我们业已取得的胜利，组织新的胜利。我们英勇的人民军队在前线已经取得的胜利是很巨大的。但这并不是意味着我们已取得了终局的胜利，也不是意味着美国武装侵略者会由我祖国疆土上老老实实地撤出去。历史上从来没有过帝国主义掠夺者不受到决定性的打击而就滚出去的事实。敌人侵略的意图越受挫折，就越要进行最后的挣扎。由于英勇的人民军的进攻而遭到节节失败，被压缩在庆尚南、北道狭窄地区的美国侵略军队和李承晚残余伪军，为了挽救其面临灭亡危机的命运，正在进行着野兽般的挣扎。因此，今天我们应该认清，从我国疆土的最后一个地区赶出敌人的战争，已进入了更炽烈更严重的决定性的阶段。我们英勇的人民军和全体人民应消灭、扫荡残存于我国疆土上的敌人，并为驱逐敌人献出加倍的努力，动员我们所有的一切力量。
    英勇的人民军各联合部队和区分队必须击灭、扫荡敌人；不要给敌人以喘息时间；不要使敌人新的地面部队登陆；继续进攻！向釜山镇海进攻！
    我们人民军的部队长和军官要很好地学会军事领导艺术；要很好地统率自己队伍，敏捷地、机动地指挥队伍，进行包围敌人的大胆的作战；应在战斗中发挥创造性。
    勇敢的人民军战士应更精通自己的武器，爱护自己的武器，不要浪费弹药与炸弹；要善于搜集已缴获的武器、弹药及炸弹，以利用它来歼灭敌人；在空袭的条件下，要善于掩护自己和自己的队伍、武器和军需资财；要善于对敌人射出命中弹；要发挥加倍的勇敢性、爱国的献身性和进攻的气概。
    后方工作人员则应保证武器、弹药和其他军需资材合理而又不浪费地继续供应前线；要很好地在空袭中掩护军需器材；正确地整理和利用所缴获的战利品；迅速恢复已毁坏的器材；应保证继续供应前线的工作。
    在后方的人民为迅速地结束战争，为争取最后胜利要击溃仇敌，应不惜生命，更加拥护和支援为祖国的独立、自由和荣誉而斗争的英勇的人民军。
    要动员一切资源与物资，使其服务于前线的需求；使后方的一切事业服从于前线的利益；节约器材、原料与食粮；要向前线供应更多的物资、军需品和食粮；要展开未曾有过的增产运动并献出创造性的努力。在“一切为了前线”、“一切为了前线的胜利”的口号下，应把后方的一切力量献给前线，以保证胜利。
    在后方的工人要更多地生产煤、钢、铁、武器及军需品；迅速恢复因遭到敌人的轰炸而被破坏的工厂和制造所，并使它开工，为适应前线要求，应加倍地提高生产速度，从轰炸中保护自己的工厂和制造所。
  消灭美国侵略者及其走狗最后胜利必属于朝鲜人民
    农民要向前线和后方供应更多的食粮，为工业供给更多的原料；不要恐惧空袭，要很好地保护自己的收获；应展开增产农产物的运动。解放地区的农民要根据无偿没收、无偿分配的原则，有成果地实施土地改革；要爱护为自己所有的土地，保证及时锄草与秋收，以保证更多的收获；要迅速恢复道路和桥梁，以使人民军在进攻中不受任何阻碍。
    南半部的工人和职员须迅速恢复被敌人破坏的生产企业，迅速恢复铁道、桥梁、运输通信机关，以满足前线的要求，保证后方的工作敏捷。要知道，因为人民军的武力而获得解放的南半部人民，现在已经不是像在李承晚统治时代那样呻吟在压迫与镇压中的奴隶，而是自己祖国的主人了。
    南半部人民要到处恢复自己的政权机关——人民委员会；一致参加人民委员会的选举。选举自己优秀的代表，以使人民委员会早日恢复被破坏的南半部经济，提高人民的生活，复兴文化，保证忠实地执行声援进攻中的人民军的全民任务。
    活跃在敌人后方的游击队要响应进攻中的人民军，积极展开自己的活动；截断敌后运输线；在敌后奇袭敌人；要破坏港湾设施，以制止美国武装侵略者新的地面部队登陆；更要炸毁军需品仓库；奇袭敌人的参谋部。
    敌人是非常凶恶而又奸诈百出的。后方的全体人民须保持军事秘密，防止敌人的侵害；坚守自己的工场、农村、家乡，对敌人要提高警惕性。要和造谣分子，逃避分子，破坏分子作无情的斗争；并要及时发现和惩办间谍和特务。
    全体人民必须早日以最后的胜利来结束我们为祖国的独立、自由、荣誉的正当斗争。最后的胜利是属于为正义的战争而奋起的朝鲜人民的！一切要服从前线的利益。全体人民要支持和声援进攻中的人民军，要迅速击灭和驱逐美帝国主义的武装侵略者及其走狗李承晚匪帮，让我们为争取胜利勇敢地前进！
    我祖国是因为伟大苏联军队的武力而从日本帝国主义长期的殖民地统治中获得解放的！“八、一五”五周年万岁！
    光荣属于反对美帝国主义者的武装侵犯者与李承晚卖国匪帮、为祖国的独立、自由、荣誉而奋起参加正义的解放战争的朝鲜人民及其武装力量——英勇的人民军！
    光荣属于在为保卫我祖国的独立、自由、荣誉的正义解放战争中牺牲的英勇的人民军官兵和男女游击队员！
    统一的朝鲜人民万岁！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    我们的解放者——伟大的苏联人民及其英明的领袖、朝鲜人民的解放救星、最亲密的朋友——伟大的斯大林大元帅万岁！
