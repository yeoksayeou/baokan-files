Beijing's Broad Masses of Workers Voice Their Angry Outcries
"We Have the Confidence and Strength to Defeat the Aggressor's Provocations!"
Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

[This Newspaper] The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant convened a meeting of labor model representatives on the evening of August 28th to discuss the US imperialist acts of aggression in the Northeast. Over twenty labor model representatives, representing over three thousand employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, expressed their protest against this act of aggression by US imperialism.

Labor model Li Jinquan said: "Let the US imperialists get out of Taiwan and Korea quickly! We cannot tolerate this act of aggression against our Northeast. We must punish the crimes of the US Air Force and demand compensation for losses, we must make the US imperialists do this."

Youth League member and labor model Liang Deyuan said: "This violent behavior of the US imperialists has aroused the anger of all our people. Tell the US imperialists: they cannot even pull out a single hair from the Chinese people. We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement."

Labor model Wang Zhongyuan said: "We must step up production and build a steel-like national defense. The Chinese people and the Korean people unite to drive the US troops out of Taiwan and Korean land and sea!"

Labor model Hu Wenqi and worker Zhang Youyi both expressed: to suggest that the Security Council try the criminals who massacred the Chinese people before the Chinese people and the people of the world; all the Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world unite and organize to fight against the US imperialists!

All the labor model representatives unanimously expressed their support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, demanding that the United States compensate for losses and punish the criminals.

Shijingshan Power Plant

[This Newspaper] The workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant, after seeing today's newspaper report that US planes invaded our airspace and strafed our locomotives, causing casualties to our people, felt very angry. Old hero Liu Yingyuan said indignantly: "The more rampant US imperialism becomes, the faster it will die. Today, the US military interfering in Korea is about to be eliminated under the attack of the Korean People's Army, yet it is invading our Northeast airspace. Our workers must step up production to support the war to liberate Taiwan and eliminate imperialist aggression."

Wang Wenbin said: "US imperialism does not want to see us building a new country under the leadership of the Communist Party, so now it is invading our heads. We will never allow US imperialism to infringe on every inch of land and every one of the Chinese people. We have the confidence to defeat it for such blatant provocations."

Advanced group leader Liu Dezhen said: "We support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and lodge a serious protest with US imperialism. For this reason, our group will intensify our work in the future, think of more ways, use our brains, and take production one step further."

Worker Han Boqin said: "Although we are all engaged in production, we have never forgotten the consistent aggression of US imperialism. We resolutely oppose US aggression and firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. We warn the US war-mongers that their provocative actions will surely bring even greater evil consequences upon themselves." After hearing this news, the workers immediately posted bulletins, big-character posters, and cartoons everywhere. Everyone believes that imperialism is dying fast, and that such crazy actions are digging its own grave. Korea has already bogged down the US, and now it is invading us again, won't it accelerate its death even more? The factory is currently selecting labor models, and the entire factory is determined to do a good job in the model selection work, increase production by one step, and strengthen the strength to oppose US aggression.

Seventieth Ordnance Factory

[This Newspaper] The workers of the Seventieth Ordnance Factory expressed extraordinary indignation at the crime of US imperialist planes invading our Northeast airspace and harming our compatriots. Du Yongshou and Fu Wanyu, leaders of the lathe group, Wang Junzhen, secretary of the Youth League branch of the Fourth Institute, and lathe workers Chu Zirong, Chen Sheng, Feng Xiaogong, and others, held a discussion during the noon break. At the meeting, everyone first analyzed the consistency of US imperialist aggression in essence, believing that the occurrence of this incident was only another exposure of US imperialism's fascist behavior. Feng Xiaogong said: "This act of aggression by US imperialism cannot scare the Chinese people who have already stood up. We already have enough confidence and strength to defeat any aggressor's provocation." Fu Wanyu said: "We must express the strength of the working class with practical actions of striving for production and improving technology. Our ordnance workers have already contributed their strength in the Liberation War in the past, and now we must fight to the end against US imperialism's aggression and to consolidate the people's national defense." Everyone unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to the US government and the telegram to the UN Security Council.

Beijing Machine Factory

[This Newspaper] The workers of the Beijing Machine Factory were greatly angered by the US imperialists' increasingly outrageous crimes of blatantly infringing on our country's territory and airspace. Machinists Zhou Xin and Hou Jiaming, fitter Zhang Hanjie and others said: "'When soldiers come, there are generals to resist; when water comes, there is earth to dam it.' We will never tolerate such blatant infringement of our territory by the US imperialists, and we must be prepared to give them a hard time!" Foundry and riveting workers Liu Qipei, Li Wenxia and others said: "Our factory used to make guns and cannons. If the United States continues to invade China, we will ask the higher authorities to let us make weapons again. If the US imperialists dare to launch a third world war, we will all take action to eliminate them!" Gao Yanchang, a few workers from the repair team, said: "Doing anything is the same. Let's all work hard, complete the tasks given to us by the higher authorities, which is also equivalent to fighting the United States." Zhao Shancun and others said: "On the one hand, we produce, and on the other hand, we support Minister Zhou's protest against the US imperialists." Fan Junfa and others from the trade union said: "We have millions of People's Liberation Army soldiers, and we also have the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Whoever comes to invade us, we will fight to crush them." Worker Zhang Delu and others said: "The result of the Lugouqiao Incident was the Japanese surrender on 'August 15th'; the result of American aggression will surely be to drive the old Americans out of Asia."

    青年团员劳动模范梁德元说：“美帝这种狂暴行为，引起了我们全体人民的愤怒。告诉美帝：要想拔中国人民的一根汗毛也不行。我们完全支持周外长的声明。”

    石景山发电厂
    【本报讯】石景山发电厂的工人们，见到今天报上登载美机侵入我国领空、扫射我机车，使我人民伤亡的消息后，都感到非常愤怒。老英雄刘英源愤慨地说：“美帝国主义越猖狂得厉害，就死亡得越快。今天，干涉朝鲜的美军，在朝鲜人民军的打击下，快要被消灭了，它却来侵犯我们东北领空。我们工人一定在生产上加油，支援解放台湾的战争，消灭帝国主义侵略。”
    王文斌说：“美帝国主义不愿看到我们在共产党领导下建设新国家，所以现在侵略到我们头上来了。我们中国每一寸土地每一个人民，绝不允许美帝国主义侵犯。它这样蛮横地挑衅，我们有信心打败它。”
    先进小组长刘德珍说：“我们拥护周外长的声明，向美帝国主义提出严重抗议。为着这，我们这个小组今后要加紧工作，多想办法，开动脑筋，把生产再提高一步。”
    工友韩伯勤说：“我们虽然都在搞生产，但是我们始终没有忘掉美帝国主义的一贯侵略行为。我们坚决反对美国侵略，坚决拥护周外长声明。我们警告美国战争贩子，他们的挑衅行为，一定为他们自己招来更大的恶果。”工人们听到这个消息后，立即在各处张贴了快报、大字报和漫画。大家都认为：帝国主义是快死亡了，这种疯狂的行动，正是给自己挖坟墓。一个朝鲜已经把美帝拖住，它今天又来侵略我们，不是更加速其死亡吗？厂子里正在选劳模，全厂决心搞好选模工作，把生产提高一步，增强反对美国侵略的力量。
