Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a war report on the evening of the 6th that People's Army troops had broken through the US Army's defense line on all fronts, which attempted to resist stubbornly along the natural obstacles of the Nakdong River, and are pursuing the retreating enemy and continuing to advance south.

On the east coast, the People's Army repelled several counterattacks by US Army tank and infantry units, and fierce fighting continues. In this battle, the US Army suffered numerous casualties, and more than 40 were captured alive. The People's Army seized a large number of armored vehicles, automobiles, and other weapons and ammunition as war booty.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: The Korean War was launched by the US imperialists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee clique. This has been newly confirmed by a military strategic plan map of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang planning a "Northern Expedition" discovered by the Korean People's Army in the Syngman Rhee puppet army's Army Headquarters when they captured Seoul.

On August 3rd, the Pyongyang newspapers published a photograph of this map. On this detailed plan map, all Korean towns, populated places, and rivers are marked in English; thick black arrows indicating the direction of the attack point north. At the same time, from this map, it can be seen that the US imperialists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee gang, had planned the "Northern Expedition" operation plan and troop deployment long ago. The map shows:

\t1. Syngman Rhee's army was organized into two corps along the 38th parallel. The First Corps was distributed from the western coast of the Yellow Sea to Gorangpo (in Gyeonggi Province, close to the 38th parallel); the Second Corps was distributed from Gorangpo to the East Sea.

\t2. From the map, it can be seen that the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet army planned to use the First Corps to attack Pyongyang. The main attack was on the right flank, directly attacking Pyongyang from Kaesong; the supporting attack was on the left flank, capturing Sincheon from Ongjin and then attacking Sariwon. At the same time, they planned to transport a portion of the army from Incheon Port to land at Hancheon in South Pyongan Province to attack Pyongyang. And it was planned to use aircraft to cover the landing in Hancheon. In the east, the Second Corps planned to attack north from Dongducheon, Chuncheon, and Han'gye Ridge. In addition, a combat unit was transferred from Gangneung in Gangwon Province to land at Hanam-ri in South Hamgyong Province, attacking Kowon, preparing to cut off the connection between North and South Hamgyong Province and Pyongyang, and decided to use air force cover during the landing in Hanam-ri.

\t3. The order of battle for the First Corps included the 1st Division and 2nd Division of the 1st Army and a regiment from Ongjin, the 5th Division of the 2nd Army and three independent detachments, and anti-aircraft artillery units. The order of battle for the Second Corps included the 7th Division and 8th Division of the 1st Army, the 6th Division independent detachment of the 2nd Army, and anti-aircraft artillery units. The reserve force belonging to the General Headquarters was the 3rd Division (missing the 5th Regiment) and the Armored Division (including the reconnaissance team, armored regiment, and the 17th Regiment).

Under the direct command of the US imperialists, the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, which formulated this "Northern Expedition" plan, launched a general offensive against areas north of the 38th parallel at dawn on June 25th. However, the plans of the US imperialists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee gang, failed to materialize. The Republic's Guard and the People's Army repelled the enemy's attack, which had invaded one to two kilometers north of the 38th parallel, and quickly launched a counteroffensive, continuing to advance south with irresistible force.

　　朝鲜人民军战胜凭借天然障碍顽抗的敌人
    突破美军洛东江防线
    人民军缴获美李策划“北伐”计划图
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部六日晚发表战报称：人民军部队已在各战线上突破企图凭借洛东江沿岸天然障碍进行顽抗的美军防御线，追击退却中的敌人，现正继续向南挺进中。
    在东海岸方面，人民军击退了美军坦克部队与步兵部队的数次反击，激战仍在继续中。在这一战斗中美军伤亡众多，并有四十余名被活捉。人民军缴获了大批装甲车、汽车及其他武器弹药等战利品。
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜战争系由美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚集团所发动，这从朝鲜人民军于攻克汉城时，在李承晚伪军陆军本部所发现的一张美帝国主义者与李承晚匪帮策划“北伐”的军事战略计划图中，得到了新的证实。
    八月三日，平壤各报登载了这张地图的摄影。在这张计划周详的地图上，所有的朝鲜城镇、有人烟的地方和河流，都以英文注明；标志进攻方向的浓黑箭头都指向北方。同时，从这张地图中可以看出美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚匪帮很早就策划好了的“北伐”的作战计划与兵力配备。该地图表明：
    一、李承晚的军队在“三八”线上编成两个军团。第一军团分布在从西部黄海沿岸到高浪浦（在京畿道，紧靠“三八”线）一段；第二军团分布在从高浪浦到东海一段。
    二、从地图中可以看出：美帝国主义者及李承晚伪军计划以第一军团进攻平壤。主攻在右翼，从开城直接攻击平壤；助攻放在左翼，从瓮津方面攻取信川，然后向沙里院进攻。同时计划从仁川港运一部分军队在平安南道汉川登陆，攻打平壤。并预定在汉川登陆时用飞机掩护。在东部的第二军团则计划从东豆川、春川、寒峙三方面向北攻击。另外从江原道江陵方面调一个战斗部队，在咸镜南道河南里登陆，向高原进攻，准备截断咸镜南北道和平壤方面的联络，并决定在河里登陆时，用空军掩护。
    三、第一军团的战斗序列包括第一军的第一师、第二师和瓮津方面的一个联队，第二军的第五师和三个别动队及高射炮部队。第二军团的战斗序列包括第一军的第七师、第八师，第二军的第六师别动队及高射炮部队。属于总司令部的预备队是第三师团（缺五联队）与装甲师团（包括侦察队、装甲联队与十七联队）。
    在美帝国主义者直接指使下，制定了这一“北伐”计划的李承晚卖国集团，于六月二十五日拂晓向“三八”线以北地区发动了总进攻。但是，美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚匪帮的计划未能实现。共和国警备队与人民军击退了侵入“三八”线以北一公里到二公里地区的敌人的进攻，迅速转入了反攻，继以破竹之势向南进军。
