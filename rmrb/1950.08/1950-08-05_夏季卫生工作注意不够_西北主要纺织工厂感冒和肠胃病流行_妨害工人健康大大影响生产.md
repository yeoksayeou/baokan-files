Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 2nd. Due to insufficient attention to factory summer hygiene work, common colds and gastrointestinal illnesses are epidemic among workers in major textile factories in the Northwest region. The temperature in the machine rooms of the private-owned Dahua Yarn Factory in Xi'an, and the state-owned Northwest Textile Company's Xianyang First Factory and Caijiapo Second Factory, are all above 100 degrees. Workers are covered in sweat when working hard, and when they leave work late at night, the outdoor climate turns cold. Suddenly walking out from the hot room is easy to cause a cold. Some factory dining halls are particularly narrow, stuffy, and have poor air quality. Workers don't want to eat when they are eating, and when they are hungry, they casually eat some cold food, so many suffer from gastrointestinal illnesses. The large-scale epidemic of diseases not only harms the health of the workers, but also greatly affects production. In the Dahua Yarn Factory's cloth mill, as many as eighty people have requested leave for sick leave, making fifty looms unable to operate. The Northwest Military and Political Committee's Labor Department has now notified the labor departments or bureaus of various provinces and cities to quickly improve factory hygiene work based on the draft "Provisional Regulations on Factory Hygiene" formulated by the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government. It has also cooperated with relevant agencies such as the Xi'an Municipal Labor Bureau, the Health Bureau, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to first establish a factory safety and hygiene committee in the Dahua Yarn Factory to improve factory summer hygiene.

　　夏季卫生工作注意不够
    西北主要纺织工厂感冒和肠胃病流行
    妨害工人健康大大影响生产
    【新华社西安二日电】由于对工厂夏季卫生工作注意不够，西北区各主要纺织工厂工人中感冒和肠胃病流行。西安私营大华纱厂、公营西北纺织公司咸阳第一厂、蔡家坡二厂等纺织工厂的机房温度均在百度以上。工人在紧张做工时满身热汗，等到后半夜放工时室外气候转凉，突由室内走出，容易感冒。有些工厂饭厅特别狭窄、闷热，空气恶劣，工人吃饭时不想吃，等到饿了时就随便吃些冷食，因此患肠胃病的很多。疾病的大量流行，不仅妨害工人的健康，并大大影响生产。大华纱厂布场请假歇工的即达八十名，使五十部车无法开动。现西北军政委员会劳动部已通知各省、市劳动厅或局根据中央人民政府劳动部制订的工厂卫生暂行条例草案迅速改进工厂卫生工作，并已协同西安市劳动局、卫生局、市总工会等有关机关，首先在大华纱厂开始成立工厂安全卫生委员会，改进工厂夏季卫生。
