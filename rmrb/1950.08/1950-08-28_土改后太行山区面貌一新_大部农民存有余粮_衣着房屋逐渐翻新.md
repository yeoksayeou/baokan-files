Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: This reporter, Li Qianfeng, reports: In the Taihang Mountain area of Shanxi, historically known as "half a year of chaff and vegetables, half a year of grain," after land reform and preliminary construction work, the vast countryside has changed its past impoverished appearance, and thousands of wealthy peasant families are developing vigorously.

　　The reporter entered the mountain area in late spring and early summer. A farmer pointed to the trees by the village and said: "If it were before land reform, the leaves on the trees would have been eaten long ago at this time of year." But now, there is no one eating chaff and vegetables in this so-called lean season. Chuandi Village in Pingshun County was a village with a poor harvest last year. The village kept eighteen *shi* of grain in the public granary, ready to help grain-deficient households, but the grain was kept until the new wheat harvest, and not even a *sheng* of grain was borrowed. Many farmers use the following proverb to praise their meals today: "Golden Queen in the morning (a newly promoted type of corn), One-Six-Nine at noon (a high-quality variety of wheat), Glassy Show in the evening (a type of millet)." Such a diet, in the past, before land reform, could only be enjoyed by the landlords and rich peasants who accounted for 10 percent of the rural population, while the poor and middle peasants, who accounted for the vast majority of the population, simply could not imagine it. In recent years, although the Taihang Mountain area has also suffered from droughts and hailstorms of varying degrees, this is just like a human body; if the resistance is strong, the disease is not easy to overcome it. Today, the phenomenon of farmers in the Taihang Mountain area having surplus grain is very common. Xigou Village in Pingshun is a small village of twenty households. Out of eighteen households in the village with surplus grain this spring and summer, there was a surplus of 130 *shi*, of which four households had more than ten *shi* each.

　　Wherever the reporter went, he saw that the trees planted by the farmers on their beloved land after land reform had already formed lush shade. In the morning, large herds of cattle and sheep were driven out of the village by shepherds. The increase in livestock is very rapid in many places. Chuandi Village in Pingshun County had only forty-nine cattle and donkeys before the land reform in 1946, but four years later, today, it has reached eighty-nine. The situation in Huojiayao Village in Licheng County is even more prominent. This tenant village of fifty households had only one donkey before the Anti-Japanese War, but today it has increased to thirty-two.

　　Many liberated peasants have built new houses. In Weijiazhuang Village, Lucheng County, sixty-four households built new houses in 1948 alone. Seventy-one households in 1949, and eighty-three households in the first half of this year. The village has a total of one hundred and thirty-four households. Many families have accumulated wood, bricks, and tiles in their yards, ready to start construction on a large scale during the slack season after the autumn harvest. Bricklayers and carpenters everywhere are now encountering an unprecedented opportunity, with wages rising year by year, and many merchants are gradually turning to this industry.

　　Due to the increase in wealth, the farmers' purchasing power for industrial products is increasing year by year. According to the statistics of the Lucheng County Cooperative, only 2,600 bolts of foreign cloth were sold in 1948, which increased to 5,120 bolts in 1949. From January to June this year, in just half a year, it has reached more than 6,000 bolts. In the past, many farmers could not afford a new set of clothes for three or two years, and most families had only one quilt for the whole family, but after the completion of land reform and the launch of the production movement, their clothing and bedding have become more abundant year by year. Two liberated peasants in Xigou Village, Pingshun County, said in a conversation: "In the past, our belongings could be carried away in one bamboo basket, but now we won't sell even a hundred *shi* of rice!"

　　土改后太行山区面貌一新  大部农民存有余粮  衣着房屋逐渐翻新
    【新华社二十六日讯】本社特派记者李千峰报道：在历史上一向被称为“半年糠菜半年粮”的山西太行山区，经过了土地改革和初步的建设工作，广大乡村已改变了过去的贫苦面貌，千万个富裕的农民家庭蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。
    记者进入山区正值春末夏初的时候，一个农民指着村边的树木说：要是在土地改革以前，现在这时节树上的叶子早被吃光了。但现在在这个所谓青黄不接的季节吃糠咽菜的已经没有。平顺县川底村去年是个歉收的村庄，村上保存着十八石义仓粮，准备接济缺粮户，但粮食一直保存到新麦登场，一升粮食都没有借出去。许多农民用下面的谚语来赞美他们今天的伙食：“早晨金皇后（一种新推广起来的玉蜀黍），晌午一六九（一种品种优良的小麦）晚上玻璃秀（一种小米）。”这样一个食谱，在过去，在土地改革以前只有占乡村人口百分之十的地主和富农可以享受得到，而占人口绝大多数的贫农和中农简直是不敢想像的。近年以来太行山区虽然也曾遭受过轻重不同的旱灾和雹灾，但这正如一个人体一样，抵抗力强起来疾病是不容易把他袭倒的。今天太行山区农民节余粮食的现象已很普遍，平顺西沟村是一个二十户人家的小村，全村今春到夏收十八家余粮户余粮一百三十多石，其中有四户各在十石以上。
    记者所到各处，看到土地改革以后农民在自己心爱的土地上种植的树木已经绿荫成阵，早晨大队的牛羊牲口被牧童赶出村庄。牲口的增加在许多地方速率很高，平顺川底村在一九四六年土地改革以前尚只有四十九头牛驴，但四年后的今天已达八十九头。黎城县霍家窑情形更突出，这一个五十户人家的佃户村抗战前只有一头毛驴，但今天已经增加到三十二头。
    许多翻身农民盖了新的房屋。潞城县魏家庄在一九四八年一年内有六十四户盖了新屋。一九四九年七十一户，今年上半年八十三户。该村共有一百三十四户居民。许多家庭在院子里积累了木料和砖瓦，准备在秋后农闲时大兴土木。各地的砖瓦匠和木匠现在遇到了千载未有的时机，工资在逐年提高，许多商贩也逐渐转向这一行业。
    由于财富的增加，农民对于工业品的购买力正在逐年提高。仅洋布一项据潞城县合作社的统计，一九四八年尚只卖出了两千六百匹，一九四九年增加到五千一百二十匹，今年一月至六月，半年内即已达到六千余匹。许多农民在过去是三年两年穿不到一身新衣裳的，大多数的家庭全家老小伙盖一床棉被，但在土地改革完成、生产运动展开以后，他们的穿着和被褥已一年比一年充实起来。平顺县西沟村两个翻身农民在对话中说：“咱们过去都是一篓担就担完了的家当，如今一百石米也不卖了！”
