　　"Mao Zedong's Sun Shines Upon Our Heads!"
　　Yao People of the Nanling Mountains Petition Chairman Mao

　　Dear Chairman Mao:

　　We are the Yao people of the eastern and western mountains of the Nanling Mountains, at the intersection of Hunan and Guangdong provinces. In the past, we suffered endless torment and countless hardships. Especially during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the suffering of our Yao people was indescribable. Things like conscription and forced labor were used to cruelly oppress the Yao people. The term "Yao Old Fellow" was a derogatory term for the Yao people. The Yao people ate miscellaneous foods such as "bitter lettuce," "banana stalks," "orange roots," "grass roots," "corn," and "sweet potatoes," living a life like cattle and horses. As a result, everyone was sallow and emaciated.

　　Since Mao Zedong's sun has shone upon our heads, we Yao people have begun to stand up and become equal to the Ming people (i.e., Han people). When Hunan Province held its first provincial peasant representative conference, our Yao representative Zhao Rongchao attended. Now, Hunan Province is holding a representative conference of all sectors of society, and the provincial government has specially invited Yao person Pan Guanghuan to attend. This is an unprecedented and joyous event for our Yao people. The government cares for our lives and helps us with production, providing us with relief grain and production loans. The People's Government is so thoughtful in its plans for us. Because we received grain from the government this year, everyone has enough to eat, and we no longer have to dig for orange roots, banana stalks, and bitter lettuce to fill our hunger. The bodies of our Yao people are beginning to strengthen. In our Yao area of one hundred and forty-four households, this year each person has opened up more wasteland, and each household has planted an extra five to six sheng of corn (each sheng of seeds yields about one shi of corn), and planted an extra fifty to sixty jin of sweet potato vines. We are now working hard to pull weeds, busy turning the vines, and doing a good job in production. We wish you good health.

　　Yao People of the Eastern and Western Nanling Mountains: Pan Furen, Zhao Jinlong, Pan Xianbao, Feng Caiwang, Zhao Gouzi, Zhao Tubao, Pan Wuxing

### “毛泽东的太阳，照到了我们的头上！”  南岭徭民上书毛主席

　　“毛泽东的太阳，照到了我们的头上！”
    南岭徭民上书毛主席亲爱的毛主席：
    我们是湘粤交界处南岭山脉东、西山的徭民。我们过去曾经受尽了磨折，经历了无数苦难，尤其在国民党反动派统治期间，我们徭民所受的痛苦，更难以言语形容，如抓丁啦，派苦役啦，对徭民施行了残酷的压榨。“徭古老”三个字就是贱视徭民的口头语。徭民们吃的是“苦莱公”、“芭蕉兜”、“橘根”、“草根”、“包谷”、“红薯”等杂食，过着牛马一般的生活。因此，大家都是面黄饥瘦的。
    自从毛泽东的太阳，照到了我们的头上，我们徭民开始翻了身，与明家人（即汉人）一律平等了。在湖南省第一次开省农民代表会时，我们徭民代表赵荣朝去参加了。现在，湖南省召开各界代表会议，省政府又特别聘请徭民盘光桓去出席。这是我们徭民“破天荒”的大喜事。政府为照顾我们的生活，帮助我们生产，发给我们救济粮和生产贷粮。人民政府这样周到地为我们打算。我们今年因领得了政府的粮食，大家都吃上了饭，没去挖橘根、芭蕉兜和苦莱公来充饥了。我们徭民的身体开始强壮起来了。在我们这一百四十四户的徭区，今年每人多开了荒地，每家增种了五升至六升的包谷（每升种子约产包谷一石），多插了五十斤至六十斤红薯藤。现在我们正在努力扯草，忙着翻藤，搞好生产。祝您健康
    南岭山脉东、西山徭民盘富仁、赵进龙、盘先保、冯财旺、赵狗子、赵土保、盘五星
