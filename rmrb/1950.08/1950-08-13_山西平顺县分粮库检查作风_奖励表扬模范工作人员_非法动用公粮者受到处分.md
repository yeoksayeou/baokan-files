　　Shanxi Pingshun County Grain Depot Rectifies Work Style
    Rewards Model Workers
    Those Who Illegally Use Public Grain Are Punished
    [This newspaper dispatch] In early June, the Pingshun County Grain Depot in Shanxi Province convened a meeting of village-level deputy depot cadres from across the county. They focused on studying documents such as the State Council's decision on the receipt, expenditure, allocation, and storage of national public grain. They seriously discussed the situation in their county, discovering problems and analyzing them through self-criticism from top to bottom. After three days of deliberation and discussion, everyone's understanding gradually improved. On this basis, model cadres were selected. The criteria were consistent, responsible implementation of the system in grain storage work over the years, no loss, no spoilage, and no problems. The deputy directors of the river east, Shenjiaping, and Nanshan village depots were selected as first-class models; the deputy directors of Wangzhuang, Nandanche, Zhangjing, Hongtiguan, Xingcheng, and Shicheng village depots were selected as second-class, and all received material rewards and commendations. Finally, the depots across the county formulated work plans to ensure no problems would occur in the future and guarantee that military and government personnel would no longer eat bad grain. In addition, Li Fengxian, director of the Chengguan Depot in the county, and Wang Kekuan, deputy manager of the Cultural Cooperative, violated the storage system and illegally used 5,000 jin of public millet in April of this year due to personal connections. The sub-depot discovered this and sent them to the county government. After interrogation, the facts were verified. They have now been formally sentenced. In addition to removing the two from their positions, Wang Kekuan was sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment with probation, and Li Fengxian was sentenced to six months of imprisonment to uphold the law.
