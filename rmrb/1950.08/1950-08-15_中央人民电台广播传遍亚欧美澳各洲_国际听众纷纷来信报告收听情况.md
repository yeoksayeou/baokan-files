　　Central People's Broadcasting Station Broadcasts Spread Across Asia, Europe, America, and Australia
　　International Listeners Send Letters Reporting Reception

　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The connection between the Central People's Broadcasting Station and overseas listeners is gradually strengthening. In recent months, the station has received many letters from foreign listeners, including those from Moscow in the Soviet Union, London in the United Kingdom, New York in the United States, Berlin in the German Democratic Republic, Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, Melbourne in southern Australia, Java in Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, and from listeners in Korea and overseas Chinese compatriots who are engaged in a heroic struggle against American imperialism. Each letter overflows with their love for the international programs of the Central People's Broadcasting Station in various languages. The voices broadcast from Beijing make them feel warm and glorious, and give the people of all nations struggling under the rule of American and British imperialism strong confidence in victory. For example, a listener from Korea wrote: "When we hear news about Korea on the radio, especially when we hear the Korean Volunteer Army March and the Victory March – these songs coming from Beijing deeply make us feel your international friendship and just support. We sing and weep along with the radio – tears of joy." A listener from Japan wrote: "Japanese working people are daily encouraged by the Japanese broadcasts from Beijing Radio, and are constantly struggling hard against the conspiracy of foreign imperialism and its running dogs, the Japanese reactionaries, to turn Japan into a military base and colony. We listen to the voices of Beijing and Moscow every day, because they give us confidence in victory." Letters from listeners in other places sometimes tell us about reception conditions and suggestions for improving our work, some hope to receive photos of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu that they long for, as well as revolutionary theoretical books, and still others ask to know the names of the announcers at certain times.

　　中央人民电台广播传遍亚欧美澳各洲
    国际听众纷纷来信报告收听情况
    【本报讯】中央人民广播电台和海外听众的联系在逐渐加强中。近几个月来该台收到许多国外听众的来信，其中包括苏联的莫斯科、英国的伦敦、美国的纽约、德意志民主共和国的柏林、印度洋的?里西斯鸟、澳洲南端的墨尔本、印度尼西亚的爪哇、越南、菲律宾、日本和正在与美帝国主义进行英勇斗争的朝鲜等地听众及我国旅外侨胞的来信。每封信都洋溢着他们对中央人民电台国际台各种语言播音的热爱。从北京播出去的声音使他们感到温暖、感到光荣，给在美英帝国主义统治下斗争着的各民族人民以坚强的胜利信心。如朝鲜听众来信说：“在广播中听到报道朝鲜消息时，首先听到朝鲜义勇军进行曲和胜利进行曲——这从北京发出来的歌声，使我们深切感受到你们的国际友爱和正义的支持。我们随着收音机而歌唱而流泪——喜欢的泪。”日本听众来信说：“日本劳动人民每天都在北京电台日语广播的鼓舞下，和外国帝国主义及其走狗日本反动派要把日本变为军事基地与殖民地的阴谋，进行不断的艰苦斗争。我们每天都在倾听着北京与莫斯科的声音，因为它给了我们胜利的信心。”其他地方听众的来信，有的告诉收听情况与改进工作的意见，有的希望寄给他们渴望中的毛主席、朱总司令的像片和革命理论书籍，更有的要求告诉他们一定时间的播音员的名字。
