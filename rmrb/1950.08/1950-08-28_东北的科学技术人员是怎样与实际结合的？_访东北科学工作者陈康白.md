How Do Scientific and Technical Personnel in Northeast China Integrate with Practice?
    ——An Interview with Chen Kangbai, a Scientific Worker in Northeast China
    By Our Reporter Bai Sheng
    Currently, there are approximately 50,000 technical personnel (from engineers to technicians) in state-owned enterprises in Northeast China. With the recovery and development of economic construction, the number of technical personnel is constantly increasing. How to fully utilize the strength of technical personnel in industrial construction is an important issue. Regarding this issue, Comrade Chen Kangbai, a scientific worker in Northeast China, shared some vivid examples of how scientific and technical personnel in Northeast China are gradually integrating with practice and working with workers to improve production technology.
    Take the Shenyang Smelting Plant as an example. In the new record creation movement and production competition, the plant's technical personnel, in conjunction with the workers, successfully completed many important technical reforms and new records, and gained experience in how to integrate technical personnel with practice.
    In the past, there was a relatively serious disunity between the technical personnel and the workers at the Shenyang Smelting Plant, which caused considerable losses in production. (Refer to the report on the inspection work of the Shenyang Smelting Plant published in the Northeast Daily at the beginning of last year.) At that time, the technical personnel did not play their due role in production. Most of the technical personnel adopted a "doing the bare minimum" attitude. Machines in the field often broke down, but no one cared, and they passed the buck. Some technical personnel, due to a lack of field experience and unfamiliarity with the problems occurring in the field, were often at a loss in the face of difficulties, so they were afraid to go to the field. Some lacked the means to approach workers or simply looked down on workers ideologically. Therefore, they did not understand the current situation and technical standards, and could not integrate with the workers' experience. For specific production operations, they had to start from book knowledge, from the standards of England, America, Japan, and the puppet Manchukuo, sit in the office to come up with ideas and make plans, which did not work when implemented, and production was not good.
    However, after the inspection work of the plant, they actively tried to overcome this serious shortcoming. First, the leadership organized political studies for the technical personnel, dispelling many of their ideological concerns, and then mobilized them to go deep into the field, assigning work according to their expertise, and providing concrete assistance to them in various aspects. After this process, they began to realize that relying solely on books was not enough. They gradually discovered that many workers often knew more about practical production problems than they did, and they saw the great scenes of the working masses exerting their labor enthusiasm and labor power. Many problems that engineers and technicians felt were difficult and not easy to solve were bravely and responsibly tackled by the working masses based on their own practical experience, and were solved quite successfully. These vivid facts in front of the technical personnel made them feel moved, and they began to approach the workers, exchange opinions, make friends, operate and study technical problems with the workers, and help the workers solve technical difficulties. Gradually, the workers warmly welcomed them.
    At the same time, the factory also absorbed them to participate in various activities such as the factory management committee, the workers' representative meeting, the cadres' meeting, the trade union, and the branch Communist Youth League forum, fully caring about their political life. They and the workers automatically formed technical research groups, and everyone jointly studied various technical problems occurring in the production process, and gave technical lessons to the workers. Many technical personnel also began to learn how to do mass work and took the initiative to integrate with the workers. For example, technician Gao Yinhuan was initially afraid to approach the workers, but later he tried to overcome this shortcoming and often talked with the workers about problems. He then seized examples to explain technology to the workers, helped the workers understand technical principles, and learned from the workers. He slowly helped the workers of the copper blast furnace improve the feeding method. Since then, workers took the initiative to ask him for help when they had problems. He said excitedly: "I feel that there used to be a chasm between me and the workers, but now this chasm has been filled." Another example is technician Zhao Qiming, who used the spare time between work to explain to the workers the completion of production tasks and the new records that appeared in production, which boosted the workers' production enthusiasm, and the workers especially welcomed him. There are quite a few such examples in various factories and mines in Northeast China.
    Because the technical personnel of the smelting plant closely combined with the working masses in production work, and under the guidance of Soviet experts' advanced technology, they jointly studied and improved many operating techniques, and at the same time, they continuously improved themselves. In this situation, around the "Red May" production competition this year, they combined with the workers to create dozens of new records. For example, technician Zhao Qiming of the smelting department and old technical worker Chen Lian'gao jointly created the magnesia brick furnace, technicians Chen Chuntai, Chen Jing, etc. successfully carried out the zinc electrolysis test, Wang Maochuan extracted metallic bismuth from the lead oxide produced in the silver separation furnace, and Jiang Shaoxuan studied the content of selenium and tellurium in the anode mud, etc. This new style of combining with practice and linking with the masses has enabled more than 20 of the plant's 50-plus technical personnel to create new records together with the workers. This has greatly advanced the work of the smelting plant.
    After the Northeast Bureau called on technical personnel to combine with workers, many factories and mines such as Shenyang Smelting Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel's coking, ironmaking, and steelmaking plants, Fushun Steel Plant, Shenyang No. 5 Machine Tool Plant, Hegang, Fuxin, Jixi and other coal mines, Textile No. 3 Plant, and Electric Engineering No. 6 Plant, by specifically implementing this call, combined technical personnel with workers, and new records of improving quality, increasing output, improving labor efficiency, and reducing costs constantly appeared in production. According to incomplete statistics, from September last year to the end of March this year alone, factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department have created 1,349 new records. Among them, 155 were creative, 344 improved work, 229 were rationalization proposals, and more than 600 others. From "Red May" to now this year, many new records have been created continuously. This has enabled various factories and mines to obtain many new technical and economic norms and new technical operating procedures, pushing the production work forward. At present, state-owned enterprises in Northeast China attach great importance to implementing the policy of uniting technical personnel and staff. Technical personnel are progressing rapidly. Because they have made contributions in practical production and have been rewarded, this has further encouraged them to embark on the road of combining theory with practice and serving the people with technology. Comrade Chen Kangbai particularly emphasized the importance of the mass viewpoint in technical research. Technical personnel and workers should respect and learn from each other. Technical personnel should acknowledge the important conditions of the working masses' familiarity with the specific situation on the spot, their rich creativity, and their contribution to production technology. The workers' creation of new records and breaking of outdated quotas and operating methods is also a scientific contribution. Therefore, only by combining the theoretical knowledge of technical personnel and the experience of workers can we more effectively play our role and make our industrial production achieve greater success.
    Talking about the current research work situation of the Northeast Science Research Institute, he said that at present, various research institutes are also moving towards combining with practice. For example, scientific and technical personnel from the Dalian and Changchun Research Institutes are solving problems in material analysis, technical operation processes, and engineering facilities for factories and mines such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Fushun, and Jinxi. Similarly, they also study pesticides and analyze soil for agriculture and forestry, and organize mineral and geological surveys in resource development. The research direction and topics of various research institutes should also be jointly decided with the production departments, so that scientific research can truly solve practical problems in production technology.

　　东北的科学技术人员是怎样与实际结合的？
    ——访东北科学工作者陈康白
    本报记者  柏生
    在目前东北公营企业中，共有技术人员（从工程师到技术员）约五万人。随着经济建设的恢复与发展，技术人员还在不断的增加。如何使技术人员的力量，在工业建设中充分发挥出来，这是一个重要的问题。关于这个问题，东北科学工作者陈康白同志给我们谈了一些生动的事例，就是东北的科学技术人员，是怎样逐步与实际结合，与工人共同改进生产技术。
    就以沈阳冶炼厂为例吧。在创造新纪录运动和生产竞赛中，该厂技术人员结合工人曾胜利完成了许多重要技术改革和新纪录，并获得如何使技术人员与实际结合的经验。
    过去沈阳冶炼厂的技术人员和工人之间是存在着比较严重的不团结现象，并曾使生产受到相当损失的。（可参考去年年初东北日报所载沈阳冶炼厂检查工作的报导。）当时的技术人员，没有发挥技术在生产中应有的作用。大多数技术人员都采取做一天和尚撞一天钟的工作态度。现场中的机器经常发生故障，无人过问，彼此互相推卸责任。有的技术人员因为缺乏现场经验，不熟悉在现场中发生的问题，往往在困难面前束手无策，所以怕到现场去。有的缺少与工人接近的办法或在思想上根本看不起工人。因此他们对于当前的情况和技术水准不了解，和工人的经验也结合不起来。对具体的生产业务，他们只好从书本知识出发，从英、美、日本、伪满的标准出发，坐在办公室里出主意订计划，拿下去行不通，生产便搞不好。
    但从该厂检查工作以后，便积极想法克服这个严重的缺点。首先领导上组织了技术人员的政治学习，解除了他们在思想上的许多顾虑，然后动员他们深入现场，按他们的专长分配工作，从各方面具体帮助他们，经过这样一番过程，他们才开始认识到自己光靠书本，是不够的。他们逐渐发现了许多工人在实际生产问题上，往往比他们懂得还多，而且看到了工人群众发挥其劳动热情和劳动力量的伟大场面。工程师、技术员当时感到困难，不易解决的许多问题，工人群众却根据自己的实际经验，勇敢负责地去做了，并且解决得相当成功。这些摆在技术人员眼前的生动事实，使他们不得不感动，他们便开始来和工人接近，交换意见，交朋友，与工人共同操作、共同研究技术问题，帮助工人解决技术上的困难。慢慢地，工人也就热烈地欢迎他们了。
    同时工厂也就吸收他们参加工厂管理委员会、职工代表会、干部会、工会和支部青年团座谈会种种活动，充分关心他们的政治生活。他们与工人就自动的成立了技术研究组，大家共同研究生产过程中发生的各种技术问题。并给工人上技术课。许多技术人员也开始学会了作群众工作，主动地去与工人结合起来。例如技术员高荫桓，最初不敢和工人接近，但后来他想法克服了这个缺点，常和工人一起谈问题，他于是抓紧事实例子给工人讲技术，帮助工人了解技术道理，并向工人学习。他慢慢地帮助铜鼓风炉的工人改进了进料的方法。从此工人有事就主动地去找他想办法。他兴奋地说：“我感觉到以往和工人之间有一条鸿沟，现在这个鸿沟填平了。”又如技术员赵启明利用上下班的空隙时间，给工人讲解生产任务完成的情况，和生产中出现的新纪录，鼓动了工人的生产情绪，工人对他特别欢迎。象这种例子东北各工厂矿山中是相当多的。
    冶炼厂技术人员因为在生产工作中密切结合工人群众，在苏联专家的先进技术的指导下，和工人共同研究改进了许多操作技术，同时也就不断地提高了自己。在这样的情形下，他们在今年红五月生产竞赛前后，与工人结合创造了数十件新纪录。如熔炼部技术员赵启明与真吹炉老技术工人陈连高共同创造的镁砖炉，技术员陈春台、陈静等的锌电解试验的成功，王懋钏在分银炉所产的氧化铅中提出金属铋，姜绍萱研究出阳极泥中的硒、碲的含量等等。这种结合实际、联系群众的新作风，使该厂五十多个技术人员中有二十余个与工人共同创造了新纪录。这就使冶炼厂的工作大大的向前推进了一步。
    在东北局号召技术人员与工人结合以后，沈阳冶炼厂、鞍钢炼焦、炼铁、和炼钢等厂，抚顺炼钢厂，沈阳机械五厂，鹤岗、阜新、鸡西等煤矿，纺织三厂，电工六厂等许多厂矿，由于具体执行了这个号召，使技术人员与工人结合起来，在生产上就不断出现了提高质量，增加产量，提高劳动效率，减低成本的新纪录。根据不完全的统计数字，光从去年九月到今年三月底止，东北工业部所属工厂矿山就曾出现了一千三百四十九件新纪录。其中有创造性的占一百五十五件，改进了工作的三百四十四件，合理化建议二百二十九件，其他六百多件。今年红五月到现在，又连续地创造了许多新纪录。这使各厂矿获得了许多新技术经济定额、新技术操作规程，把生产工作向前推动了一步。目前东北的公营企业是十分注重贯彻团结技术人员与职员的政策的。技术人员都进步得很快。因为他们在实际生产中有了贡献，受到了奖励，这样更鼓舞了他们走向理论与实际结合，技术为人民服务的道路。陈康白同志特别强调技术研究上的群众观点的重要性。技术人员和工人要互相尊重，互相学习。技术人员要承认工人群众的熟悉现场具体情况的重要条件、丰富的创造力和对生产技术的贡献。工人创造了新纪录，打破了陈旧的定额和操作方法，这也是科学贡献。因此只有把技术人员的理论知识和工人的经验很好的结合起来，才能更有效地发挥作用，使我们的工业生产获得更大的成就。
    谈到目前东北科学研究所的研究工作情形，他说，目前各研究所也正在向与实际结合的路上走，如大连、长春两研究所的科学技术人员正在为鞍钢、抚顺、锦西等厂矿解决材料分析、技术操作过程、和工程设施上某些问题。同样他们也为农林方面研究杀虫剂、分析土壤，并在富源开发方面组织矿产和地质调查。各研究所的研究方针和题目，也要与生产部门共同商决，使科学研究真正能解决生产技术上的实际问题。
