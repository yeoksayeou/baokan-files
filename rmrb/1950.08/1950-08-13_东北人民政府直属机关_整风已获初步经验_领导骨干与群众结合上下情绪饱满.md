　　Northeast People's Government Directly Subordinate Organs
    Rectification Has Gained Preliminary Experience
    Leading Cadres Combine with the Masses, Morale is High From Top to Bottom
    [This dispatch from the Northeast Daily News on the 4th] The rectification movement in the directly subordinate departments of the Northeast People's Government has gained preliminary experience. First, they paid attention to using the rectification method of combining leadership with the masses. The steps are: first, convene cadres at the section chief level and above to deliberate and examine the leadership of the department; after the minister absorbs these preliminary opinions, studies them, and makes full preparations, he then convenes a mobilization meeting of all cadres. In the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, he points out the main problems to be solved in the rectification from the perspectives of policy and leadership style. After the meeting, the core group, composed of cadres at the section chief level and above, continues to deeply examine the leadership of the department based on the report. At the same time, they begin to absorb all cadres to participate in units organized by division, and examine the work of the division. The division chief, on the one hand, according to the instructions of the department, more specifically studies the work of the division, proposes key points, and makes guiding and enlightening reports (the more fully prepared this report is, the better the effect); on the other hand, he personally participates in the division meetings, collects the opinions of the masses within the division, and brings them to the core group to supplement the department's review. This allows the thoughts of the upper and lower levels to be integrated. Through repeated summarization and discussion, the rectification gradually deepens, avoiding the shackles of mechanically dividing the rectification into stages by level, preventing the rectification from merely remaining among a few leading cadres; and it is not an unled core, a step-by-step parallel advancement, so that the masses do not lose direction.
    Leaders are responsible, and the Party and the administration cooperate closely.
    Secondly, under the direct control of the Northeast People's Government, the cooperation between the administration and the Party in various departments is also relatively good. Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, often personally convenes meetings of administrative leading cadres of various departments, listens to reports, and gives specific instructions on the content and steps of the rectification. Comrades from the Party general branch also participate in the meetings, and the general branch immediately transmits the instructions to the relevant departments and the experience of the various departments to the various branches after the meeting. Most of the branch secretaries participate in the core groups of the various units, and in a certain period, the general branch convenes joint meetings of branch secretaries to understand the rectification situation of the various units from the Party system. This makes it so that: (1) The branch is familiar with the key points and policies of the rectification in this unit, so it can better mobilize all Party members to play an active role in the inspection work. (2) The branch is familiar with the specific instructions of the higher-level leaders and the overall situation of this unit, which is convenient for helping the administration to check and supervise whether the rectification work of this unit has grasped the center of gravity and whether it has grasped the progress well. (3) The branch is familiar with the administrative business and some problems existing in the work and style through this rectification movement, so that it can better guarantee the completion of administrative tasks in the rectification process and in future work, and make the rectification spirit well implemented in regular work.
    Adopt four combinations
    In addition, these departments also adopted the following methods: (1) Combining work inspection with work improvement. Some problems that belong to the work system or life that can be quickly resolved, adopt the opinions of the masses in a timely manner and immediately improve them. (2) Combining learning documents with work inspection, without rigidly stipulating that all documents should be studied first and then work inspection should begin, but rather learning relevant documents in conjunction with work inspection, and sometimes referring to laws and policies related to the work of the department for learning and discussion. (3) Combining inspection work in the organs with inspection work at the grassroots level. For example, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has sent people to its subordinate units and on-site to focus on inspecting work, and bring the inspection results back to the department, so that the inspection of the organs is more practical. (4) Soliciting the opinions of relevant departments. For example, the General Office and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry have widely solicited opinions from relevant departments to strengthen the work inspection of their departments.
    Individual departments have biases
    However, during this period, the leadership of individual departments also produced some biases. One is that they did not carefully study, discuss, and accept the instructions of the higher-level leaders, and were not good at combining the principled instructions of the leadership with the specific situation of their departments. They simply transmitted the instructions of the higher-level leaders as they were, without enriching them according to the specific situation of their departments, so that the lower-level cadres could not get inspiration and still could not find a clue when inspecting the work. Another is that some leading cadres could not get rid of regular work and participated in fewer rectification meetings, which affected the deepening of the rectification work in their departments. The problems that should be solved in a timely manner were not resolved in a timely manner, so the comrades below still had the feeling that "suggestions are useless," which affected the enthusiasm of the masses. Still another is that the leadership did not grasp the direction and the center of gravity, but only vaguely and formally "carried forward democracy," so that the people below made a series of endless opinions, some of which still remained in the set of general free-thinking rectifications and self-examinations, which could not be combined with specific work. Some did not grasp the criticism and self-criticism enough, and even refused criticism.
    Since the CCP Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau successively issued instructions on Party rectification, the various departments, committees, and banks of the Northeast People's Government, according to the instructions and in light of the actual situation of their units, have separately put forward specific plans on how to conduct rectification in conjunction with the current work. The heads of the Party in various departments participated in a symposium held by the heads of directly subordinate units of the Northeast Bureau from June 26th to 28th. Comrades Gao Gang and Li Fuchun personally gave instructions on the specific plans of the various departments. Since the beginning of the rectification in various departments, due to the tight grip of the leadership, the close cooperation between the administrative officials and the Party branch, the timely exchange of experience, and the attention to correcting certain shortcomings, the movement has been carried out relatively widely, and the morale from top to bottom has been full. The leading cadres of some units have mastered the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and can analyze and understand the main shortcomings in advance, so they feel cordial to the opinions raised by everyone, and the other party can accept them with a sincere attitude. The general cadres have realized that inspecting work is the best way of rectification, dispelled some of the original concerns of some cadres, and actively put forward criticisms and suggestions.

　　东北人民政府直属机关
    整风已获初步经验
    领导骨干与群众结合上下情绪饱满
    【本报讯】东北日报四日消息：东北人民政府直属各部门的整风运动已获得了初步经验。首先，他们注意了运用领导与群众结合的整风方法。其步骤是：先召集科长以上干部酝酿，检查部的领导；部长在吸收了这些初步意见后，加以研究并作充分的准备，然后召集全体干部的动员大会，以批评与自我批评的精神，从政策观点和领导作风上指出整风中要解决的主要问题。会后，由科长以上干部组成的核心组，根据报告，继续深入检查部的领导。同时开始以处为单位，吸收全体干部参加，检查处的工作。处长一方面根据部的指示，更具体地研究本处的工作，提出重点，作引导和启发性的报告（这种报告准备得愈充分，效果就愈好）；另一方面，又亲自参加处的会议，收集处内群众的意见，带到核心组里去，以补充部的检讨。这样就使上下级的思想融汇贯通。在反复的总结、讨论中，使整风逐渐深入，既可避免机械地按级划分阶段整风的束缚，不致把整风仅仅停留在少数领导干部中间；又不是无领导核心、无步骤地齐头并进，使群众不致失去方向。
    首长负责，党与行政密切配合。
    其次，在东北人民政府的直接掌握下，各部门的行政与党的配合也比较好。东北人民政府林枫副主席经常亲自召集各部门的行政领导干部开会，听取汇报，并对整风内容与步骤作具体指示。开会时并有党总支同志参加，总支在会后立即把对有关各部门的指示及各部门的经验传达给各支部。各支部书记多半参加了各单位的核心组，在一定时期，总支又召开支部书记联席会议，从党的系统来了解各单位的整风情况。这样，就使得：（一）支部熟悉本单位的整风重点和方针，可以按此来更好地动员全体党员在检查工作中发挥积极作用。（二）支部熟悉了上级领导的具体指示和本单位的全面情况，便于帮助行政上来检查督促本单位整风工作是否抓住了重心，是否很好地掌握了进度。（三）支部通过这次整风运动熟悉了行政业务及工作与作风中存在的一些问题，以便在整风过程中与今后工作中更好地保证行政任务的完成，并使整风精神能很好地贯彻到经常工作中去。
    采取四种结合方法
    此外，这些部门还采用了下列一些方法：（一）检查工作与改进工作相结合。有些属于工作制度或生活上的可以很快解决的问题，及时采纳群众意见，立即改进。（二）学习文件与检查工作结合，不死板地规定先学习全部文件然后再开始检查工作，而是配合检查工作来学习有关的文件，有时并参照与本部门工作有关的法令政策来进行学习和讨论。（三）机关中的检查工作与到下层检查工作相结合。如农林部已派人到所属各单位及现场有重点地检查工作，把检查结果带到部里来，使机关的检查更切合实际。（四）征求有关部门的意见。如办公厅，农林部已向各有关部门广泛征求意见，以加强本部门的工作检查。
    个别部门发生偏向
    但在这一时期中，个别部门对整风的领导也产生了一些偏向。一种是未认真研究、讨论、接受上级的指示，不善于把领导上的原则性的指示与本部门的具体情况结合起来，只把上级指示简单地照样传达下去，未能根据本部门具体情况加以发挥充实，使下级干部得不到启发，在检查工作时仍找不到头绪。另一种是某些领导干部摆不开经常工作，参加整风会议较少，影响了本部门整风工作的深入。该及时解决的问题也没有及时解决，使下边同志仍有“提意见不顶事”的感觉，影响了群众的积极性。再一种是领导上没有掌握方向、抓住重心，只是空泛地形式地“发扬民主”，使下边漫无边际乱提一阵意见，有的仍停留在泛泛地整自由主义、搞反省等一套，未能与具体工作相结合，有的对批评与自我批评还掌握不够，甚至有拒绝批评的。
    自中共中央和东北局先后发出整党指示后，东北人民政府各部、会、行曾根据指示，联系本单位实际情况，分别提出如何结合当前工作进行整风的具体计划。各部党的负责人曾参加东北局直属各单位负责人在六月二十六日到二十八日举行的座谈会，高岗同志与李富春同志，曾亲自就各部门的具体计划分别作了指示。各部门整风开始以来，由于领导上抓得紧，行政负责同志与党支部密切配合，及时交流了经验，注意纠正了某些缺点，运动开展比较广泛，从上到下情绪饱满。某些单位的领导干部掌握了批评与自我批评的武器，对主要缺点能事先有所分析和认识，因此对大家提的意见觉得亲切，对方能以诚恳的态度来接受。一般干部都体会到了检查工作是整风最好的方式，打消了某些干部原有的顾虑，积极地提出了批评与建议。
