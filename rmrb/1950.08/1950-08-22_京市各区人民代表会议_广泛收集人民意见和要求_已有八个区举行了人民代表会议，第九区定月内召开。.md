　　People's Representative Conferences in Beijing Districts
    Widely Collect People's Opinions and Demands
    Eight Districts Have Already Held People's Representative Conferences, and the Ninth District is Scheduled to Convene Within the Month.
    [This newspaper's report] Following the pilot programs in the First, Sixth, Seventh, and Fifth Districts of Beijing, the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles have achieved significant results. Recently, the Third Meeting of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles decided to universally convene the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in each district. Up to now, the Third, Second, Eighth, and Fourth Districts have completed their conferences. The Ninth District has also decided to convene within the month. When convening the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in each district, in addition to listening to the work reports of the district governments, the opinions and demands of the broad masses of the people were concentrated, and the problems related to public welfare, municipal construction, and public security raised by the people of all circles in the district were discussed and resolved. The people of the Third District submitted more than 5,000 relevant proposals on the above-mentioned topics at the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the district, and other districts also submitted two to three thousand proposals.
    Through the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles, the broad masses of the people examined the work style of government staff and put forward criticisms. The people of all circles in the Third District put forward 195 proposals related to criticizing the work style of cadres, including 22 related to the departments of the district office, 58 related to the public security sub-bureau, and 115 related to other departments. After inspection by each department, they were answered or reviewed separately.
    After the district representative conferences, the people of all circles further realized that the government is their own. Wei Yuedong, a representative of the Fourth District, said: "The government and the people are one family, like living together, everyone handles things together." The representatives of the Ninth District are actively collecting proposals and carrying out publicity work in preparation for convening the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the district. District representative Liu Rui collects proposals from door to door every day; Li Xijin, a worker representative from Danhua Match Factory, stops the cart whenever he stops to deliver goods and conducts propaganda to the masses. Since the decision to convene the district representative conference, the staff and district representatives of each district have paid more attention to improving their work style. For example, recently, when there was heavy rain, some representatives helped neighbors whose houses had collapsed to move overnight, fully demonstrating the spirit of serving the people.

　　京市各区人民代表会议
    广泛收集人民意见和要求
    已有八个区举行了人民代表会议，第九区定月内召开。
    【本报讯】北京市区各界人民代表会议自第一、第六、第七、第五等四个区重点试行后有显著成绩。最近经京市第二届第三次各界人民代表会议决定在各区普遍召开区各界人民代表会议。迄今为止，第三区、第二区、第八区、第四区等四个区已举行完毕。第九区亦决定在月内召开。各区在召开区各界人民代表会议时，除听取区政府的工作报告外，并集中了广大人民的意见和要求，讨论与解决了区内各界人民所提关于公共福利和市政建设及治安等方面的问题。第三区人民在该区各界人民代表会议上提出了有关上述提案五千多件，其他各区，亦有两、三千件。
    通过区各界人民代表会议，广大人民群众检查了政府工作人员的作风，提出了批评，第三区各界人民提出了有关批评干部作风的提案一百九十五件，其中有关区公所各部门的二十二件；有关公安分局的五十八件；有关其他各部门的一百一十五件，都经过各部门检查后分别答复或进行检讨。
    各界人民经过区代表会议以后，进一步认识到政府是自己的，第四区代表魏岳东说：“政府和人民就是一家人，像过日子一样，大家有事大家办。”九区区代表们为了准备召开该区各界人民代表会议，已在积极收集提案和进行宣传工作。区代表刘瑞每日逐户收集提案；丹华火柴厂工人代表李希金，在推车送货时，一停下车就向群众进行宣传。自从决定召开区代表会议以来，各区工作人员和区代表都更加注意改进工作作风。如最近下大雨时，有的代表连夜帮助塌了房子的邻居搬家，充分表现了为人民服务的精神。（纪纲、志诚）
