　　Technician Yuan Zhaofu
    Cui Youde
    Yuan Zhaofu is a technician at the state-owned Jiangbei Chemical Factory in Jilin, and is thirty-one years old this year. He has seven years of practical work experience in this factory. He is able to unite the workers, find ways to overcome difficulties in production, and respond to the call from higher authorities to increase production.
    During the Kuomintang rule, the equipment of the chemical factory was almost completely destroyed. Therefore, when the phosphorus production workshop was building an electric furnace last year, the most difficult thing was the lack of various materials. Under these extremely difficult circumstances, Comrade Yuan Zhaofu responded to the call of the leadership, mobilized the workers to collect and contribute equipment everywhere, and took the lead in contributing the electric furnace design patterns from the puppet Manchukuo era.
    Comrade Yuan Zhaofu's work has the following advantages: combining technology with practice, going deep into the field, discovering problems, and providing specific guidance. For example, when the factory built the electric furnace according to the pattern he contributed, some of the materials purchased and collected could be used, and some could not. For example, the puppet Manchukuo electric furnace was built with eight hanging bricks (the weight of ordinary eight refractory bricks is equal to the weight of one eight hanging brick). In the absence of this brick, it was impossible to build an electric furnace, so Comrade Yuan Zhaofu thought of a way to modify the original design pattern of the puppet Manchukuo electric furnace, using large special-shaped refractory bricks from the mechanical workshop, cutting off two angles, to build the current electric furnace. When building the electric furnace, he was afraid that the workers would be exhausted, so he personally went to the site to guide the workers. When a worker laid a brick crookedly, he would tell him the distance between the seams. Finally, the electric furnace was built, and the life of this electric furnace has far exceeded the puppet Manchukuo standard.
    This year in April, the electrode of the phosphorus production workshop broke, and production could not continue. He seized the time to mobilize the electric furnace workers to find a solution, and studied and guided the operating methods with the workers, overcoming the difficulties. In addition, he linked the three workshops together, accurately calculated the production figures of each workshop, and told the workers how much more they had to produce to complete the task. For example, the refining workshop only had one pressing pot, which made it difficult to complete the task. At this time, Comrade Yuan Zhaofu took the initiative to discuss a concentrated effort with his fellow workers, and installed another pressing pot. The factory implemented a responsibility system. From April to June, Yuan Zhaofu led the workers to formulate a detailed production responsibility system (this production responsibility system includes five items: 1. Administrative organization and work responsibility system; 2. Operating regulations and production responsibility system for the yellow phosphorus department; 3. Operating regulations and production responsibility system for the phosphorus sulfide department; 4. Shift handover responsibility system for each workshop; 5. Phosphorus production labor convention responsibility system) and the trade union printed it into a booklet and distributed it to the workers, so that the workers could implement the responsibility system in various jobs on site. When the electric furnace was first started, it could not be ventilated. He thought of a way to make a wind cylinder so that it could safely deliver air; he also personally led the repair of the motor port and drying furnace, avoiding the risk of accidents, ensuring smooth production, and making the production of phosphorus sulfide in May exceed the task by 55.6 percent. Comrade Yuan Zhaofu can grasp the key points in leading production. For example, after the electrode broke in April, his work focus shifted to the electric furnace, so that the electric furnace was repaired quickly and the output increased. Comrade Yuan Zhaofu can promptly point out the key areas and what issues should be paid attention to when guiding workers in their operations. For example, when the electrode was repaired and power was turned on in May, he told the workers: the furnace body and the cooler are prone to air leakage, and if the air cannot be completely removed after power is turned on, the furnace body will explode. He reminded the workers to pay attention to prevent accidents from happening (this type of accident had occurred three times last year when Yuan Zhaofu had not yet arrived).
    He has a high enthusiasm for work. In April and May, the electrodes of the electric furnace broke twice in a row. In order to repair the electrodes quickly, he did not sleep for two days and nights, and repaired them with the workers. Afterwards, the factory director wanted to give him a day off, but he was unwilling to rest and insisted on working.
    He is not only willing to enthusiastically and proactively teach his fellow workers to learn technology, but also leads them to study culture. When building the electric furnace last year, he took the initiative to organize the workers to learn technology, and made great achievements. In the past, the workers simply did not know how to mix raw materials; but now one-third of the old workers who have studied the four arithmetic operations have learned to calculate the proportion of raw materials, and workers who cannot do arithmetic can also remember the proportion of raw materials. Mason Lu Dianyi could not read blueprints when building the electric furnace. After Comrade Yuan Zhaofu's patient explanation and guidance, he finally learned. In order to make everyone understand the operating procedures, Comrade Yuan Zhaofu combined his operating experience and theory to compile and print a booklet for everyone to learn. The workers were very happy.
    The factory often uses chemical formulas (all foreign symbols) in its work, but few workers know them. Yuan Zhaofu enthusiastically organized the workers to study. In order to make it easier for the workers to learn, he first compiled a simple symbol to replace the foreign symbols of the molecular formula, so that the workers could understand the meaning of the molecular formula; later, he wrote the "ABC song" to help remember foreign letters and taught everyone to learn. Therefore, the workers have made rapid progress in learning English symbols. Now, one-third of the old workers who can do the four arithmetic operations have learned the chemical molecular formulas of the phosphorus production workshop, and can write them at any time and recognize them.

　　技师原兆富
    崔有得
    原兆富是国营吉林江北化学工厂的技师，今年三十一岁。他在本厂已有七年的实际工作经验。他能团结职工，想办法克服生产中的困难，并响应上级号召，增加生产。
    国民党统治时期，化学工厂的设备几乎全部被破坏。因此在去年制磷场修建电炉时最感困难的是缺乏各种材料。在这极端困难的情况下，原兆富同志响应领导上的号召，发动工人到处收集、献纳器材，并自己带头献出伪满时代的电炉设计图案。
    原兆富同志的工作有如下几个优点：技术与实际结合，深入现场，发现问题，具体指导。比如厂方按照他献出的图案修建电炉时，买来的与收集来的材料有的能用，有的就不能用。如伪满电炉是用八枚挂砖砌成的（普通八块耐火砖等于一块八枚挂砖的重量）。在没有这砖即不能修建电炉的情况下，原兆富同志就想办法把原伪满时代的电炉设计图案修改了，利用机械场大型异形耐火砖，切去两个角度，建成现在的电炉。在修建电炉时，他怕工人累坏了，便亲自到现场指导工人。工人把一块砖砌歪时，他就告诉他缝的距离远近。终于修建好了电炉，而这种电炉的寿命已远超过伪满的标准。
    今年四月制磷场电极折断了，不能生产，他就抓紧时间发动电炉工人想办法，和工人研究并指导操作法，克服了困难。另外他又把三个车间联系起来，准确地计算各车间的生产数字，告诉工人多出多少才能完成任务。又如精制车间只有一个押闸锅，很难完成任务，此时原兆富同志即主动地和工友商量突击，又安设了一个押闸锅。工厂推行专责制。原兆富从四月至六月领导工友制订了详细的生产专责制（此生产专责制共包括五项：一、行政组织及工作责任制；二、黄磷部操作规程及生产专责制；三、硫化磷部操作规程及生产专责制；四、各车间交接班专责制；五、制磷劳动公约专责制）并由工会把它印成小册子发给工人，使工人在现场各种工作上，都能执行专责制。电炉刚开炉时不能吹风，他想办法作了一个风筒，使它能安全送风；又亲自领导修好电机口和干燥炉，避免了发生事故的危险，保证顺利生产，并使五月份硫化磷生产超过了任务的百分之五五·六。原兆富同志在领导生产上能抓住重点，如四月份电极折断后，他的工作重点就转到电炉，使电炉很快修好，增加产量。原兆富同志在领导工人操作上，能及时指出那些地方是要害，应注意那些问题。如五月份电极修好后开炉送电时，他告诉工人：炉体和冷却器容易渗入空气，送电后如空气不能完全清除，炉体就会爆炸，提起工人的注意，防止了事故的发生（去年原兆富未来时，这类事故曾发生过三次）。
    他工作热情很高。四、五月内电炉的电极接连折断二次，他为了要赶紧修好电极，就两昼夜不睡觉，和工友们一起修理。事后厂长要给他补假，他不愿休息，还是坚持工作。
    他不但肯热心、主动地教工友们学习技术，并且还领导工友们学习文化。在去年修建电炉的时候，他主动组织工友们学习技术，有了很大的成绩。以前工友们根本就不懂得如何配原料；但现在学过算术四则题的老工人已经有三分之一学会了计算原料配合比例，不会算术的工人也能记住了原料配合比例。瓦匠吕殿义在修建电炉时，不会看图纸，经过原兆富同志耐心解释指导，终于学会了。原兆富同志为了使大家都懂得操作规程，就把自己的操作经验和理论相互结合起来，编印成小册子发给大家学习。工友们都很高兴。
    该厂工作时经常要用化学上的分子式（都是外文符号），但工友们会的很少。原兆富就很热心地组织了工友们学习。他为了使工友们学习方便，开始时先编了一种简单的符号代替分子式的外文符号，使工友们懂得分子式的意义；后来又把帮助记忆外文字母的“ＡＢＣ歌”写出来，教大家学。所以工友学习英文符号进步都很快。现在会算算术四则题的老工人，已经有三分之一的人学会了制磷场的化学分子式，并且做到随时写出都能认得。
