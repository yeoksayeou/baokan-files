General Kim Il-sung's heroic anti-Japanese armed struggle led by the Korean people had a broad and consolidated anti-Japanese national united front as its material foundation, which is what raised the Korean national liberation struggle to a higher stage.

After the Japanese imperialists invaded Northeast China in 1931, General Kim Il-sung established guerrilla bases in the Changbai Mountain area. Around the guerrillas, anti-imperialist alliances, anti-Japanese associations, youth volunteer armies, peasant associations, peasant self-defense forces, production guerrillas, women's groups, and children's corps conducted extensive anti-Japanese activities. However, the Japanese imperialists aimed to frustrate the revolutionary forces growing like wildfire among the Korean people. They directly carried out armed "suppression," while expanding the so-called "collective village" policy, organizing fascist groups such as the "Reservists Association" and "Youth Corps," arming them, and making them act as dikes to suppress the anti-Japanese revolutionary forces.

At a time when the Japanese imperialists were implementing such extremely reactionary and brutal policies, General Kim Il-sung consistently defended the interests of the people, educated them with revolutionary anti-Japanese thought, enhanced their patriotic enthusiasm, monitored the reactionary groups who acted as lackeys of the Japanese imperialists, and isolated them from the masses. On the other hand, he vigorously promoted the people's spontaneous support for the activities of the guerrilla forces. In this way, all national forces opposed to Japanese imperialism, including workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, entrepreneurs, merchants, and religious figures, formed a strong anti-Japanese national united front.

The Korean National Liberation Association, led by General Kim Il-sung, summarized the experiences and lessons of previous national united fronts and began to be established in 1935.

With the aim of overthrowing Japanese imperialism and establishing a democratic and independent country, all the people of Korea, except for a very small number of pro-Japanese elements and national traitors, the Korean National Liberation Association formulated the following Ten-Point Program to achieve this goal:

(1) Mobilize the entire Korean nation, realize a broad anti-Japanese united front, overthrow the rule of the Japanese bandits, and establish a genuine Korean People's Government.

(2) Closely unite the Korean and Chinese nations, overthrow Japan and its puppet "Manchukuo," establish a revolutionary government elected by the Chinese people, and implement genuine autonomy for Koreans residing in Chinese territory.

(3) Disarm the Japanese army, gendarmes, police, and their lackeys, and organize the people's armed forces that will assist our patriotic comrades in their activities and fight for the genuine independence of Korea.

(4) Confiscate all Japanese enterprises, banks, railways, ships, farms, repair institutions, and all properties and lands of traitorous pro-Japanese elements as the economic foundation for the independence movement, and use part of it to relieve the poor.

(5) Cancel the debts, various taxes, and monopoly systems imposed on the people by Japan and its lackeys, improve the lives of the masses, and allow national industry, agriculture, and commerce to develop without hindrance.

(6) Fight for freedom of speech, publication, thought, assembly, and association, oppose the implementation of the Japanese imperialists' terror policies. Oppose promoting feudal ideas, and release all political prisoners.

(7) Abolish the unequal relations between the Yangban (similar to the Chinese scholar-official class) and commoners and others. All people, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or religion, are equal, enhance the social status of women, and respect their dignity.

(8) Abolish slave education, oppose forced military service and military education for young people, implement education in the Korean language and script, and implement compulsory free education.

(9) Implement an eight-hour work system, improve working conditions, increase wages, establish labor laws, and implement various worker insurance laws by state organs to relieve all unemployed workers.

(10) Closely unite with nations and countries that treat the Korean nation equally, and maintain comradely friendship with countries and nations that show benevolent neutrality toward our national liberation movement.

The Ten-Point Program of the Korean National Liberation Association was not only the basic program of struggle for the national liberation movement of the Korean people in Northeast China at that time, but also a groundbreaking basic program in the history of Korean national liberation. This program specifically expressed the practical interests and demands of the entire Korean people in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, military affairs, and foreign policy. It can be said to be the first historical document of the people's government, so these ten programs not only explain the activities of the Korean National Liberation Association, but also the political line and the entire picture of the Korean national liberation movement at that time.

The Korean National Liberation Association did not represent the interests of any one class or stratum. It directly supported the practical demands and interests of all the people. Therefore, in the Korean National Liberation Association, with General Kim Il-sung as its chairman, many famous patriotic fighters, led by revolutionary fighters such as Kim Chaek and Choe Yong-gon, gathered. These communists and all patriots, despite the inconsistencies in their political stances and ideologies, joined hands to overthrow the rule of the common enemy—Japanese imperialism—and establish a national independent state.

In this way, the Korean National Liberation Association, as an anti-Japanese national united front organization, included not only workers, peasants, and students, but also anti-Japanese entrepreneurs, merchants, religious figures, and other strata. Due to the rapid development of organizational strength, the Korean National Liberation Association had more than 200,000 members.

The Korean National Liberation Association's huge mass organizational strength became the foundation for General Kim Il-sung's guerrilla anti-Japanese armed struggle. Such a consolidated military-political union, with consistent internal and external organization and activities, deeply struck the bandit Japanese imperialists until the very last moment.

This anti-Japanese national united front unfolded in a cruel struggle against the enemy from day one. Due to the Japanese imperialists' so-called "suppression," tens of thousands of patriotic people of the Korean National Liberation Association were arrested and imprisoned or sacrificed.

The Korean National Liberation Association led by Kim Il-sung established close ties with the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Northeast China, which concentrated all anti-Japanese forces of the Chinese people, thus unifying the entire anti-Japanese armed struggle in Northeast China. On the other hand, it also sent political workers to the Hamgyong North and South Provinces, Pyongan North and South Provinces, and Gangwon Province area to establish contact with revolutionary fighters in Korea and directly lead the revolutionary masses in Korea. As a result, the organization of the Korean National Liberation Association not only expanded to areas along the border such as Kapsan, Hoin, Singap’o, Musan, Kyongsong, Myongchon, Tanchon, and Sinuiju, but also to factory centers such as Hamhung, Hungnam, Wonsan, Songjin, and Chorwon. Of course, the organizational system was not uniform. Depending on the actual local conditions, there were organizations such as the National Liberation Comrades Alliance, the Anti-Japanese Youth Alliance, the Anti-Japanese Small Group, the Young Pioneers, the Relief Society, the Anti-Japanese Association, and the Women's Liberation Alliance. These groups all concentrated vast anti-Japanese forces. These organizations launched struggles to directly strike the Japanese imperialists, destroying local military facilities and military supplies factories, and secretly transporting military supplies, food, newspapers, and magazines to General Kim Il-sung's guerrilla forces, providing military secrets, and undertaking arduous tasks.

Along with the development of the Korean National Liberation Association organization and the fierce anti-Japanese struggle was the propaganda and mobilization work to encourage the anti-Japanese consciousness and patriotic thought of the people. The Korean National Liberation Association secretly published its organ magazine, the "March 1st" Monthly and "Hwajeonmin" (organ magazine in Korea), and printed and distributed many pamphlets and leaflets, launching powerful propaganda.

The anti-Japanese armed struggle led by General Kim Il-sung and the extensive activities of the Korean National Liberation Association unfolded amidst the most ferocious and beastly war of aggression by the Japanese imperialists. Those brilliant achievements have been written into world history and have become the honor of the Korean nation. However, at that time, General Kim Il-sung also firmly believed that the liberation of the Korean nation depended on uniting with the powerful anti-imperialist world democratic forces. During World War II, he foresaw that only the entry of the great Soviet Union, standing at the forefront of the world democratic camp, could truly liberate the Korean nation from the rule of Japanese imperialism. In accordance with the requirements of the new emergency situation, General Kim Il-sung made great efforts to strengthen international ties with the world's democratic forces.

The laws of history developed in the direction of General Kim Il-sung's efforts. The decisive role played by the great Soviet army finally brought World War II to an end. The Korean people have since gained the historic "August 15" liberation. Then, due to the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Korean people truly enjoyed the fruits of victory.

　　金日成将军与朝鲜反日民族统一战线
    李同建译
    金日成将军所领导的朝鲜人民的英勇的反日武装斗争，是有广泛巩固的反日民族统一战线作为它的物质基础的，就是这一点使朝鲜民族解放斗争提到更高的阶段了。
    一九三一年日本帝国主义侵犯中国东北以后，金日成将军在长白山一带成立了游击队根据地。在游击队周围，反帝同盟、反日会、青年义勇军、农民协会、农民自卫队、生产游击队、妇女团体、少年团等群众的反日团体，进行着广泛的活动。但是，日本帝国主义所抱的目的却要挫败朝鲜人民大众当中如火焰一般成长着的革命力量，直接进行武力“讨伐”，同时扩大所谓“集团村庄”政策，组织“在乡军人会”、“青年团”等法西斯团体，给他们武器，做日本帝国主义走狗，使他们负起压制反日革命力量的防堤作用。
    金日成将军就在日本帝国主义这样地实行极端反动的凶暴政策的时候，一贯地维护人民大众的利益，以革命的反日思想教育人民大众，提高爱国热情，监视那些做日本帝国主义走狗的反动团体，使它们在民众中孤立起来；另一方面，大力推动人民大众自发地支援游击部队的活动。这样，工人、农民、学生、知识分子、企业家、商人、宗教家等反对日本帝国主义的一切民族力量组成坚强的抗日民族统一战线了。
    金日成将军所领导的朝鲜祖国光复会是总结了以往的民族统一战线的经验教训，在一九三五年开始成立的。
    全朝鲜的人民除极少数亲日派和民族叛徒以外，抱着打倒日本帝国主义，建立民主独立国家的目的，祖国光复会为了实现这目的制定十大纲领如下：
    （一）将朝鲜民族总动员，实现广大反日统一战线，推翻日本强盗统治，建立真正朝鲜人民政府。
    （二）紧密联合朝中民族，推翻日本及其走狗“满洲国”建立中国人民选举的革命政府，实行居住在中国领土上的朝鲜人的真正自治。
    （三）解除日本军队、宪兵、警察、及其走狗武装，将援助我们爱国同志活动和为朝鲜人真正独立而斗争的人民武力军队组织起来。
    （四）没收日本的一切企业、银行、铁道、船舶、农场，修理机关，以及卖国亲日分子的全部财产和土地作为独立运动的经济基础，其中一部分救济贫困人民。
    （五）取消日本及其走狗对人民的债权、各种捐税和专卖制度，改善大众生活，使民族工农商业不受障碍而发展。
    （六）争取言论、出版、思想、集会、结社的自由，反对日寇恐怖政策的实现。反对鼓吹封建思想，释放一切政治犯。
    （七）废除两班（近似中国士大夫阶级）和平民之间及其他不平等的关系。男女、民族、宗教等一律平等，提高妇女社会地位，尊重妇女人格。
    （八）废除奴化教育，反对强迫服务军役及对青少年的军事教育，实行朝鲜语言文字的教育，和义务免费教育。
    （九）实行八小时劳动制度，改善劳动条件，提高工资，确定劳动法案，由国家机关实行各种工人保险法，救济一切失业的劳动大众。
    （十）亲密联合以平等对待朝鲜民族的民族和国家，并对我们民族解放运动表示善意中立的国家和民族，保持同志般的亲善。
    祖国光复会的十大纲领不但是当时在东北的朝鲜人民民族解放运动的基本斗争纲领，而且实在是朝鲜民族解放史上划时代的基本纲领。这纲领在政治、经济、文化、军事及对外政策等各方面具体地表示了全体朝鲜人民的切实利益和要求，可以说是人民政权的第一个历史文献，所以这十大纲领不但说明了祖国光复会的活动，而且也是当时朝鲜民族解放运动的政治路线及其活动的全貌。
    祖国光复会并不代表那一个阶级或者那一个阶层的利益，它直接拥护全体人民切实的要求和利益，因此，在金日成将军作为主席的祖国光复会里，聚集了金策、崔庸健等革命斗士为首的许多著名爱国斗士，这些共产主义者和一切爱国人士尽管政治立场和思想上存在着不一致，但是为了争取推翻共同敌人——日本帝国主义的统治，建立祖国的民族独立国家，却携手团结起来了。
    这样，作为反日民族统一战线组织的祖国光复会不仅包括了工人、农民和学生，而且包括了反日的企业家、商人、宗教家等各阶层。由于组织力量的飞速发展，祖国光复会有了二十多万会员。
    祖国光复会如此巨大的群众组织力量，成为金日成将军游击部队抗日武装斗争的基础。这样巩固的军政联合，表里一致的组织及其活动深深地打击了强盗日本帝国主义，直到最后一刻。
    这种反日民族统一战线从第一天起就在对敌人的残酷斗争中展开，由于日本帝国主义的所谓“讨伐”，祖国光复会爱国人士，被捕入狱或遭牺牲，先后达数万人之多。
    金日成所领导的祖国光复会在中国东北，和集中中国人民一切反日力量的抗日救国会取得了紧密的联系，于是使中国整个东北的抗日武装斗争实现了统一。在另一方面，又派遣政治工作员到咸镜南北道、平安南北道和江原道一带，和朝鲜国内革命斗士取得了联系，直接领导朝鲜国内的革命群众。于是，祖国光复会的组织不仅扩大到国境地带的甲山、好仁、新加坡、茂山、镜城、明川、端川、新义州等地，而且扩大到咸兴、兴南、元山、城津、铁原等工厂中心地区。当然，组织体系不是一律相同的，依照当地实际情况，组织起来的有民族解放者同盟、反日青年同盟、反日小组、少年探险队、救援会、反日会、妇女解放同盟等。这些团体都各把广大反日力量集中起来。这些组织展开直接打击日本帝国主义的斗争，破坏当地军事设备和军需工厂等，同时秘密向金日成将军游击部队输送军需资材、食粮、报章杂志等，供给军事机密，担负了艰苦任务。
    和祖国光复会组织的发展及炽烈的抗日斗争同时进行的就是鼓舞人民大众的抗日意识和爱国思想的宣传鼓动工作。祖国光复会秘密发刊了机关杂志，“三一”月刊和“火田民”（朝鲜国内机关杂志）以外，并油印散发许多小册子和传单，展开有力的宣传。
    金日成将军所领导的抗日武装斗争和祖国光复会的广泛活动都在日本帝国主义最狂暴的野兽般的侵略战争中间展开着。那些光辉的成果已经写在世界史上，成为朝鲜民族的荣誉了。但是，当时金日成将军，却也坚信朝鲜民族的解放还有赖于和强大的反帝的世界民主力量的联合。在第二次世界大战期间，他预见到，只有站在世界民主阵营前面的伟大苏联的出兵才能使朝鲜民族从日本帝国主义统治下获得真正的解放。依照新的紧急情势的要求，金日成将军就在加强与世界民主力量的国际联系上，作了很大的努力。
    历史的规律是按照金日成将军努力的方向发展的。伟大的苏军所起的决定性作用，终于使第二次世界大战结束了。朝鲜人民从此获得了历史性的“八·一五”解放。接着由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的成立，朝鲜人民才真正享受到胜利的果实了。
