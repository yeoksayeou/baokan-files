　　Longyan Hospital in Xuanhua City Should Seriously Improve Its Work; Repeated Incidents of Neglecting Human Life Have Occurred
　　Editor:
　　Longyan Hospital in Xuanhua and its affiliated Yantongshan Clinic are irresponsible to patients. Several deaths have occurred due to careless treatment. We are now telling you about several things we know, and we hope you will publish them to draw the attention of the hospital and its leadership to quickly correct the shortcomings and errors in the hospital's work.
　　Last year (the date is not clear), Yantongshan worker Lian Sheng suddenly fainted while playing ball. The workers rushed to ask for a doctor. But after asking three or four times, the doctor came. It was already dark, and the patient was breathing very hard. The doctor did not make a careful diagnosis, and gave the patient an injection. The patient died immediately.
　　Yantongshan worker Yuan Junling went to Xuanhua city on May 1st this year. He had a stomach ache after eating unclean food. He asked someone to call a doctor, and it took several times before the doctor came. The doctor did not diagnose the illness, but just asked the hygienist to give an injection. The patient died at noon the next day.
　　Yantongshan worker Xie went to Longyan Hospital for treatment on July 3rd. The doctor gave him an injection, an enema, and left. After an hour, the patient wanted to defecate, so he shouted loudly for the nurse. But he shouted for half an hour and the nurse still didn't come. The patient had no choice but to get down himself. As a result, the illness worsened. In the evening, because the nurse was not careful, he was fed noodles, which choked him (it took a lot of effort to get him to swallow it). The patient died the next day.
　　Comrade Liu Fubang, a security guard at the iron smelting plant, had a stomach ailment and went to Longyan Hospital for treatment. A doctor surnamed Su in the hospital rashly performed surgery without careful diagnosis. But after the surgery, they could not find the disease.
　　Yantongshan worker Song Weili was hospitalized in Longyan Hospital. Because the nurse was careless when looking for a needle, the injection site on his left arm became ulcerated and festered.
　　We believe that the shortcomings of Longyan Hospital and Yantongshan Clinic are very serious. However, the head of the hospital, Dr. Jiang Songquan, and the doctor of Yantongshan Clinic, Jiang Songwei, are not open to accepting the opinions of the workers and reviewing their own shortcomings. We suggest that the leaders of Longyan Iron Mine should urge the hospital to conduct a review and improve its work.

　　宣化市龙烟医院应切实改进工作
    曾屡次发生玩忽人命事件
　　编辑同志：
    宣化龙烟医院及其所属的烟筒山医务所，对病人不负责任，数次发生因治疗不细心而使病人死亡的事情。现在把我们所知道的几件事情告诉你们，并望你们发表，以引起该院及其领导上的注意，迅速改正该院工作中的缺点和错误。
    去年（日子记不清了）烟筒山工友连生，打球时突然晕倒。工友们急忙去请大夫。但请了三四次，大夫才来。当时天已黑了，病人喘息得很厉害。大夫没有经过细心的诊断，就替病人打针。病人立时便断了气。
    烟筒山工友袁俊岭，今年五月一日到宣化城里去，因吃了不洁净的食物回来后就肚子痛。他叫人去请大夫，也是请了好几回大夫才来。大夫没断明是什么病，只是叫卫生员打了一针。次日中午病人就死了。
    烟筒山工友谢某，在七月三号到龙烟医院治病。大夫给打了针，灌了肠，走了。过了一个钟头，病人要大便，就高声喊护士。可是他喊了半点钟护士还没来。病人没法，只得自己下来。结果就使病势加重了。晚上因护士不注意，给他吃了面条，结果哽住了（费了很大的劲才使他咽下去）。第二天病人就死了。
    炼铁厂警卫员刘复帮同志，肚里有病到龙烟医院医治。该院一位姓苏的医生未经细心诊断，便轻率地开了刀。但开刀后，却又打不出病在那里。
    烟筒山工友宋维礼，住在龙烟医院治病。因为护士找针时粗枝大叶，竟使他的左臂注射部位溃烂出脓。
    我们认为：龙烟医院和烟筒山医务所的缺点，是很严重的。但该院负责人姜松泉大夫和烟筒山医务所姜松维医生，却不虚心接受工友们的意见，检讨自己的工作缺点。我们建议龙烟铁矿领导上，应督促该院进行检讨，改进工作。
