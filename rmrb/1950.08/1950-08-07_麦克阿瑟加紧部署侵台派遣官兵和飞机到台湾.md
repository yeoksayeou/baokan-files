Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch:

War-monger MacArthur has begun to intensify his deployment to invade Taiwan since returning to Japan from Taiwan. MacArthur has dispatched his Deputy Chief of Staff, Fox, along with twenty American officers and soldiers from Tokyo to Taiwan to further control the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. Five American jet fighters have flown from Okinawa to Taiwan. The U.S. Air Force is also establishing a base in Hsinchu, 30 kilometers from Taipei, and U.S. Thirteenth Air Force Commander Tenner has also arrived in Taipei. According to an Associated Press reporter, "Several air bases in Taiwan may be used by American troops." Simultaneously with the arrival of the American invading air force in Taiwan, the U.S. Seventh Fleet cruiser USS Juneau and transport ship USS New Mallon arrived in Keelung on the 5th.

In addition to strengthening its military control over Taiwan, American invaders are also strengthening their economic aggression against Taiwan. Jaffe, a financial "expert" from the U.S. Treasury Department, was sent to Taiwan on the 4th.

　　麦克阿瑟加紧部署侵台派遣官兵和飞机到台湾
    【新华社六日讯】战争贩子麦克阿瑟离台返日后，已开始加紧其侵略台湾的部署。麦克阿瑟已从东京派遣他的副参谋长福克斯率领二十名美军官兵到达台湾，以进一步控制蒋介石残余匪军。美国的五架喷气战斗机已从冲绳岛飞抵台湾。美国空军并在台北三十公里的新竹建立基地，美国第十三航空队司令滕纳亦到了台北。据美联社记者透露，“可能有几个台湾的空军基地供美国部队之用”。与美国侵略者空军到达台湾同时，美国第七舰队所属巡洋舰朱诺号和运输舰新马伦号亦于五日抵基隆。
    美国侵略者除了加强其军事控制台湾外，还加强其对台湾的经济侵略。美国财政部的金融“专家”贾福金已在四日派到台湾。
