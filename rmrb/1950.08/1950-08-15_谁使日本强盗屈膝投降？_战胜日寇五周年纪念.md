　　Who Made the Japanese Bandits Surrender?
    Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of Victory over Japan
　　Kebonian
    August 15, 1945, is a memorable day when the Japanese imperialist bandits were defeated.

    Japanese imperialists once attempted to conquer China and Asia by force, realizing their dream of dominating East Asia. However, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people fought bravely, shattering the Japanese imperialists' dream of swallowing China in a short period. The Chinese people's eight years of heroic resistance against Japan greatly consumed and weakened the Japanese armed forces, which is one of the most important factors in the final defeat of Japanese imperialism.

    The Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan on August 8, 1945, was a decisive move that prompted Japanese imperialism to implement unconditional surrender. The heroic Soviet Red Army, just three months after the victorious end of the war against Germany, that is, after it had crushed two hundred mechanized divisions of the German Kou, marched eastward and attacked the Japanese Kou. With the cooperation of the Chinese people's armed forces and the Outer Mongolian army, the Soviet Red Army, with the force of a thunderbolt, divided its forces into three routes, attacking the puppet Manchukuo war base that the Japanese Kou had been operating for fourteen years. In less than a week, the Red Army annihilated 764,000 of the Japanese Kou's elite Kwantung Army, liberating the entire Northeast. This eliminated the backbone of the Japanese imperialist armed forces, making it impossible for them to continue fighting the Allied forces, forcing the Japanese Kou to surrender unconditionally.

    American imperialists and their lackeys shamelessly attribute the credit for defeating Japan to the two atomic bombs the United States dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The purpose of their statement is to distort history. The effect of the American imperialists dropping atomic bombs on Japan was merely the mass slaughter of peaceful residents in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which basically did not weaken the Japanese imperialist war power. After the United States dropped the atomic bombs, Japanese imperialism still retained its main military forces and continued to fight; only after the Soviet Union sent troops and annihilated the Kwantung Army did the Japanese imperialists have to surrender unconditionally.

    History cannot be distorted. In the war against Japan, the atomic bomb was not the decisive factor for victory. Those plans that attempt to use atomic bombs to frighten the people of the world in order to invade the whole world will inevitably be proven to be complete dreams.

### 谁使日本强盗屈膝投降？  战胜日寇五周年纪念

　　谁使日本强盗屈膝投降？
    战胜日寇五周年纪念
　　柯柏年
    一九四五年八月十五日，是日本帝国主义强盗被打倒的值得纪念的一日。
    日本帝国主义者曾妄图以武力征服中国、征服亚洲，实现其霸占东亚的迷梦。但中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，英勇作战，打破了日本帝国主义者在很短时间内吞灭中国之梦想。中国人民八年的英勇抗战，使日本武装力量受到很大消耗与削弱，这是日本帝国主义最后失败之最主要因素之一。
    苏联在一九四五年八月八日对日宣战，则是促使日本帝国主义实行无条件投降之决定性的一着。英勇无比的苏联红军，在对德战争胜利结束之后刚刚三个月，即是说，在它击溃了德寇两百个机械化师团之后，便挥师东向，出击日寇。苏联红军得到中国人民武装及外蒙军队配合之下，以雷霆万钧之势，分兵三路，进攻日寇经营十四年的伪满战争基地。不到一个星期，红军即歼灭日寇精锐部队关东军七十六万四千人，解放了整个东北。这就消灭了日本帝国主义的武装力量的骨干，使其继续对盟国作战成为不可能，迫使日寇不得不屈膝投降。
    美帝国主义者及其喽罗们，大言不惭地将战败日本的功劳，归之于美国在广岛、长崎投掷的两颗原子弹。他们的这种说法，其目的在于歪曲历史。美帝国主义者在日本投掷原子弹，其效果不过是广岛、长崎的和平居民遭受大批屠杀，基本上并没有使日本帝国主义战争力量受到削弱。在美国投掷原子弹之后，日本帝国主义仍保有其主要的军事武装，并继续作战；只有在苏联出兵，歼灭了关东军之后，日本帝国主义者才不得不无条件投降。
    历史是不容歪曲的。在对日作战中，原子弹就不是决定的胜利的因素。那些企图用原子弹骇倒全世界人民，以便侵略全世界的计划，必将被证明完全是梦想。
