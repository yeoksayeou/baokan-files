　　Report on the Preliminary Summary of the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council's Half-Year Work and Future Work Tasks
    I. Our committee was established last November and has been in operation for more than half a year until the end of May this year. Because the institution was newly established, there were insufficient cadres and a lack of experience. Therefore, the work of exploration and investigation took a considerable amount of time. From last November to the end of January this year, the main tasks were to take over the North China People's Supervision Court, handle the transferred cases of the court, establish institutions, allocate cadres, conduct business studies, and draft the organization regulations for people's supervision committees at all levels in preparation for further work. In February, we officially began inspection work. The situation and experience are briefly reported as follows:
    (1) Regarding Supervision and Inspection: From January to now, our committee has received 142 cases of accusations against various public officials. Including: 58 cases of accusations against public officials by the masses in various places, 36 cases reported by various agencies and organizations, 17 cases reported by various provincial governments, 7 cases ordered by the Central People's Government or the Government Administration Council, and 24 cases reflected from newspapers or by cadres. Among them, there were 51 cases of dereliction of duty (such as bureaucratism and poor management), 35 cases of violations of policies and laws, 14 cases of corruption, 3 cases of sabotage by secret agents, and 39 other cases (false accusations, denials, dissatisfaction with court judgments, and mass disputes). Cases occurring in various agencies of the Government Administration Council and its directly affiliated state-owned enterprise departments, or local cases of national significance or involving senior administrative personnel, were directly handled by our committee; cases not falling under the above categories were transferred to the People's Supervision Committees of the Greater Administrative Regions or directly affiliated provinces and cities under the Central Government for handling; cases outside the scope of the Government Administration Council were transferred to the relevant agencies for self-handling. As a result, a total of 56 cases were directly inspected and handled by our committee, and 86 cases were transferred to the Greater Administrative Regions or directly affiliated provinces, municipalities, the Central Military Commission, and judicial organs for handling. A total of 70 percent of the cases have been closed, and the rest are being inspected and handled.
    In addition, in order to implement the Central Committee's policy of production and disaster relief, an inspection team was organized in March to inspect the severely affected areas of Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Pingyuan, and Northern Anhui, discovering and correcting many shortcomings and errors in the local production and disaster relief work, which also provided considerable help to production and disaster relief.
    The cases directly inspected and handled by our committee, such as the Nanjing Dongshanqiao Forestry Farm destruction case, the Huachiying Station train crash of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau, the Yiluo Coal Mine gas explosion case, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau water tower project waste case, and the Tianjin North China Oil and Grease Company loss case, were all handled with a cautious and serious attitude, combining investigation and research with mass reporting, organizing inspection teams to investigate the scene of the incident, mobilizing employees of the offending agency to conduct joint reviews, and maintaining close contact with the competent authorities and relevant departments, or having them send personnel to participate and cooperate. Generally speaking, we started by helping them inspect their work, and after democratic review, we found the causes of the shortcomings or errors and clarified the responsibility for the incident. On the one hand, those responsible were given appropriate punishment or commendation, and on the other hand, suggestions for improving the work were made, thereby educating the cadres and strengthening their determination to pay attention to responsibility, improve their work, and increase their work efficiency. Our committee attaches great importance to the complaints of the masses, such as an anonymous report from a citizen that the trade department exported a large amount of copper and copperware to be absorbed by American imperialism, and a report from the masses, Wang Qingyu, that materials in the No. 129 warehouse in Shijiazhuang were improperly placed and there were no fire-fighting facilities, resulting in losses. After investigation, it was found that the facts were true, and we immediately cooperated with the competent authorities to study and make corrections and gave appropriate handling, which further inspired the masses' confidence in the government's supervision. According to recent feedback, departments that have had cases supervised by our committee feel that it has helped their work, and the masses have praised the "People's Government for handling affairs seriously and strictly enforcing discipline."
    (2) Our committee has also provided some guidance on the establishment of the work of people's supervision committees at all levels. At present, the supervisory committees of the four major administrative regions of Northeast, Northwest, East China, and Central South have been established one after another, and the supervisory organs of provinces and cities have been established in seven places, including Hebei, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Beijing. Among them, the People's Supervision Committee of the Northeast Greater Administrative Region and the People's Supervision Organs of Hebei Province have carried out many inspection tasks earlier, gained some experience, and initially established the prestige of the People's Supervision Organs among local cadres and the masses. Local people's governments also attach great importance to the reporting of illegal acts, dereliction of duty, corruption, and waste of public officials, and have discovered and solved many problems. Recently, various departments directly under the Northwest Military and Political Committee launched a mass movement against unhealthy tendencies, achieving great results.
    Although the supervision work in the past half year has made some achievements, there are still many shortcomings, mainly slowness, passivity, and failure to keep up with objective needs. Until now, due to the lack of cadres, the organizational structures of our committee and the supervisory committees of the major administrative regions have not been sound, many provincial and municipal supervisory committees have not been established, and the necessary supervisory system has not been fully established, which has affected the work. Our supervisory work is still generally limited to after the occurrence of accidents, and we have not been able to conduct inspections in peacetime to prevent problems before they occur. We also often feel that the post-mortem inspections of many important cases are not thorough and comprehensive. In terms of handling, more emphasis is placed on investigating responsibility, although the causes of the accidents are also pointed out, and a certain educational effect has been achieved, but the suggestions for improving the work are not done enough. At the same time, the complicated handling procedures and lack of experience have often led to long delays in cases, which is also a shortcoming.
    II. Since the liberation of vast areas last year, we have achieved a series of major achievements in various aspects of taking over new areas, establishing people's power, eliminating bandits, stabilizing social order, supporting the war, restoring production, unifying finance, stabilizing financial prices, and overcoming natural disasters; however, in some departments and some areas, especially in some financial and economic organs and enterprise departments, major events that damage state property and the interests of the people have continued to occur. According to recent incomplete and inaccurate statistics, from last year to May this year, a total of more than 6,100 large and small incidents occurred in central organs and major administrative regions, of which more than 60 percent were caused by illegal acts, dereliction of duty, and lack of experience, more than 30 percent were caused by sabotage by secret agents, and more than 7 percent were caused by other unclear responsibilities. According to the statistics of only a part of them that have been evaluated, the loss was as much as 680 billion yuan in RMB and more than 77 million catties of millet. More seriously, 536 workers, peasants, soldiers, and cadres were killed or injured (405 dead and 131 injured). (⑴⑶)
    The reasons for the above-mentioned incidents are quite complicated. In the enterprise sector, due to the long-term destruction of the reactionary rule, in addition to the cases of bandit and secret agent sabotage, some of the incidents that occurred in the enterprises were caused by the extremely old equipment and extremely corrupt management of the taken-over industrial and mining industries, and the short period of time for the takeover made it inevitable that accidents would occur. Some incidents were mainly caused by the lack of experience of the staff, rather than by their illegal acts or dereliction of duty. However, it must be pointed out that many of these accidents were caused by the arrogance and complacency, paralysis and carelessness of some leaders, especially their bureaucracy and commandism. For example, in the Northeast from October to December last year, due to the paralysis and carelessness of the leadership of some industrial and mining departments, imperfect systems, and lax discipline, there were 303 fires, resulting in a loss of more than 38 billion Northeast yuan. Another example is the well-known Yiluo Coal Mine disaster in Henan, which was caused by the blind pursuit of production figures by the coal mine leaders, launching erroneous "production competitions" and "democratic movements," which destroyed the coal mine project, coupled with the adoption of methods of suppressing workers and attacking old personnel, and sitting idly by while feudal foremen gained power, resulting in extremely serious internal disunity; and this erroneous practice lasted for eight months, and its superior leaders did not discover it, resulting in the tragic gas explosion in February this year, which crushed 174 workers to death, injured 26 people, and caused a loss of more than 1.8 million catties of wheat. Another example is the loan of cotton seeds by the Northwest agricultural and forestry departments, due to a series of bureaucratism in the "acquisition," "storage," "experiment," and "distribution" process, resulting in a large number of moldy cotton seeds being distributed to the masses, making the cotton seedlings in most areas very bad, and the worst only had 10% seedlings. It is estimated that the state lost more than 3 billion yuan, and the masses lost even more, which affected the plan to increase cotton production. Another example is that the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau built 16 120-ton water towers in November 1949. Due to the bureaucratism of the leadership, its unrealistic plan and budget were approved, and various forms of corruption and fraud occurred in contracting and procurement. If it were not for the workers' reports and the Central Government's sending personnel to check and correct it, it would have lost more than 9 million catties of wheat. In some disaster areas last year, the relief was delayed due to the bureaucratism of the leadership, and the disaster became serious. For example, after the floods in northern Anhui in July last year, there were more than 8 million disaster victims, accounting for nearly one-third of the total population of northern Anhui, but the leaders did not understand the actual situation and thought it was "okay" until the disaster was extremely serious in January this year, when they seriously attached importance to their production and disaster relief work, it was too late, resulting in a serious phenomenon of famine and death among the disaster victims. A district chief in a certain county in Hebei Province, in order to complete the cotton planting task on time, did not allow the masses to go to the market, and if he could not stop them, he personally ran to the market and fired a shot to threaten them. The masses moved the market to another place, and he threatened them again. A farmer in Huayin County, Shaanxi Province, did not plant the cotton seeds issued by the government, but planted his own cotton seeds (which actually had better seedlings than the cotton seeds issued by the government). The cadres, on the pretext that he did not use good varieties, forced him to remove the seedlings and punished him for not being allowed to grow cotton for one year. There are many examples of bureaucratism and commandism like this, and there is no need to list them one by one. This kind of bureaucratism and commandism not only caused major losses to the property of the state and the people, but also hindered the close connection between the People's Government and the broad masses of the people. Moreover, this kind of bureaucratism and commandism gave opportunities for bandits and secret agents and lawless elements. This situation deserves our serious attention.
    Based on the above situation and experience, the people's supervision work should pay attention to the following points in the future:
    1. During the cadre training period, governments at all levels should concentrate their attention on correcting the arrogant and complacent emotions and the bureaucratic and commandist style of leadership cadres at all levels. The way to correct it is to convene a meeting of staff members to move from checking work to checking ideology and work style; to let go of democracy under centralized leadership and to carry out criticism and self-criticism. In the process of checking work and checking ideology and work style, it is necessary to sum up work experience, educate cadres, and improve policy and business level. People's governments at all levels should attach importance to the role of the People's Supervision Organs and, in accordance with Article 19 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, "People's Supervision Organs shall be established in the people's governments at all levels above the county and city levels to supervise whether state organs at all levels and various public officials are performing their duties and to correct illegal and derelict organs and personnel," as quickly as possible to establish and improve the organization of the People's Supervision Committee, give it the necessary leadership, so that it can coordinate with the various tasks of the government and conduct regular and effective supervision and inspection of state organs and public officials.
    2. The specific task of the People's Supervision Committee is to fight against corruption, waste, bureaucratism, commandism, and other illegal acts and dereliction of duty in political organs and enterprise departments, to supervise organs at all levels and various public officials to be conscientious and responsible, abide by laws and regulations, abide by labor discipline, and serve the people wholeheartedly. In order to achieve this goal, regular inspection and accident inspection should be well combined. Regular and planned inspections and inspections after accidents are all for the purpose of discovering problems, solving problems, exchanging experiences, correcting shortcomings, commending achievements, educating cadres, and improving work. In accident inspections, attention should be paid to investigating responsibility and giving appropriate punishment, because this is necessary to rectify political discipline; but attention should also be paid to discovering model personnel before and after the accident and giving them commendation or rewards.
    3. In order to enable the supervision work to play its due role, it is necessary to adopt the mass line of combining with the broad masses of the people. When inspecting and handling each case, it is necessary to closely combine with the masses, mobilize the employees of the inspected organ and the relevant masses to conduct democratic reviews; at the same time, it should be closely linked with the competent authorities and relevant organs, and cooperate through consultation. This can make the understanding of the problem more comprehensive, the conclusion more correct, and the inspection and handling can be fully effective.
    4. Establish a system of supervision correspondents in order to contact the masses and grasp the situation. People's supervision committees at all levels should, in accordance with the measures for people's supervision correspondents to be issued by our committee, organize people's supervision correspondents, and through the method of supervision correspondents, find and absorb activists among the masses to participate in the supervision work, maintain close contact with them, collect information, and seriously receive and handle the cases they report. This is an important task of the People's Supervision Organs at present.
    5. Since the supervision organs and supervision personnel have assumed the responsibility of representing the state power to supervise and correct state organs and public officials, they should attach importance to their responsibilities, actively study Chairman Mao's thought and style, be familiar with the government's policies and laws, and not only become models of implementing policies, abiding by laws, being conscientious and responsible, working hard, being honest and simple, and uniting the masses, but also complete the people's supervision tasks with a pragmatic and selfless attitude towards things and people in the inspection and handling of cases.
    III. The work tasks of our committee in the second half of the year:
    (1) Work tasks: The work tasks of our committee in the second half of the year are to cooperate with cadre training, organize, promote and guide the central departments and major administrative regions and provinces and cities directly under the central government, concentrate forces, and fight against bureaucratism, commandism, as well as corruption, waste, sabotage of production, and all illegal acts and dereliction of duty and other bad phenomena. The focus of work is on financial and economic departments, while paying attention to administrative organs. Strive to thoroughly inspect ten to fifteen key state-owned major factories, mines, warehouses, shops, banks, grain, taxation, transportation, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy and other undertakings and key counties and cities in the second half of the year. At the same time, in the cases of accusations against government organs and public officials, select some of the important ones to directly inspect several cases, draw experience, and promote it to various places.
    (2) Work steps: Our committee should use the existing forces in a concentrated manner and focus on key inspections. First, start with the central departments and provinces and cities directly under the central government, and further promote the major administrative regions. It is planned to prepare in June, complete key inspections in July, August, September, and October, and summarize the work experience in November and December as the basis for carrying out supervision work in 1951.
    (3) Improve the supervision organization: The established supervisory committees of major administrative regions and provinces and cities (including the Central Supervision Committee) should quickly allocate cadres and complete the staffing. Provinces, cities, and counties that have not established people's supervision committees should also be established gradually as much as possible. According to the measures for establishing supervision correspondents in organs and organizations of our committee, strive to complete the organization of establishing people's supervision correspondents in central organs and organizations before September. At the same time, collect materials on supervision work from various places, study them, and prepare to convene a national supervision conference in winter to summarize experience and discuss the issue of supervision work in 1951.
    (4) Establish a supervision system: In order to enable supervision organs and personnel at all levels to have something to follow in their work, the organization regulations of supervision committees at all levels should be revised based on the work experience of the past half year and submitted to the Government Administration Council for promulgation and implementation. Formulate regulations on punishment of civil servants to unify the methods of punishment and disciplinary procedures to prevent the phenomenon of being too lenient or too harsh when implementing punishment. In addition, strengthen editing and research work: collect the theories and regulations of supervision work in the Soviet socialist countries, collect and sort out the experience of supervision work of governments at all levels, as learning materials for supervision personnel, and as a reference for formulating a supervision system. Publish the irregular "People's Supervision" to facilitate the exchange of work experience among supervision organs at all levels.

　　政务院人民监察委员会
    半年工作初步总结及今后工作任务的报告
    一、本委自去年十一月成立至今年五月底，已逾半年。由于机关新设，干部不足，经验缺乏，故试探摸索工作曾经过相当时间。从去年十一月至今年一月底，主要工作是接收华北人民监察院，处理该院的移交案件，建立机构，配备干部，进行业务学习，草拟各级人民监察委员会组织条例等准备工作。二月份正式开始检查工作，其情况与经验简报如后：
    （一）关于监督检查：本委由一月到现在，共收到控诉各种公务人员案件一百四十二件。计：各地群众控告公务人员案件五十八起，各机关团体报来案件三十六起，各省府报来案件十七起，中央人民政府或政务院令办案件七起，从报纸上反映或干部反映的案件二十四起。其中失职案（如官僚主义及管理不善等）五十一件，违反政策法令案三十五件，贪污案十四件，特务破坏案三件，其他案（诬告、抵赖、法院判决不服、群众纠纷）三十九件。其中属于政务院各机关及其直属各国营企业部门所发生的案件，或地方案件之具有全国性重要意义或涉及高级行政人员者，经由本委直接处理；不属于上述性质的案件，均经分别交由大行政区或中央直属省、市人民监察委员会处理；不在政务院所属范围内的其他方面之案件，则分别移交各该机关自行处理。结果经本委直接检查处理者共五十六件，转交各大行政区或中央直属各省、市政府与中央军委及司法机关处理者八十六件，总计已有百分之七十结案，其余正在检查处理中。
    此外为贯彻中央生产救灾方针，曾于三月间组织检查小组分赴山东、苏北、平原、皖北各地重灾区检查，发现与纠正了各地生产救灾工作中许多缺点与错误，对生产救灾亦有相当帮助。
    本委直接检查处理之案件，如：南京东善桥林场破坏案，津浦铁路局花旗营站撞车案，宜洛煤矿沼气爆炸案，郑州铁路局水塔工程浪费案，天津华北油脂公司损失案等，均以审慎严肃态度，采取调查研究与群众检举相结合的方式，组织检查小组赴肇事地点调查，发动肇事机关之员工共同检讨，同时与主管机关及有关部门取得密切联系，或由其派员参加，协力进行。一般地说，做到了从帮助他们检查工作着手，经过民主检讨，找出缺点或错误的原因，弄清事件的责任。一方面分别地给予负责者以适当的惩戒或表扬，另方面多少提出了改进工作的建议，从而教育了干部，加强了他们重视责任、改进工作与提高工作效率的决心。本委对于群众的控告十分重视，如一市民匿名报告贸易部门有大量铜及铜器出口为美帝国主义所吸收案，群众王庆雨报告石家庄一二九仓库物资放置不当，且无防火设备发生损失案等，经调查均属事实，即协同主管部门研究，作出纠正办法，并予以适当处理，由此更启发了群众对政府监督的信心。根据最近反映，在机关方面，凡经过本委监察过案件的部门，都感到对其工作有帮助，在群众方面亦有“人民政府办事认真，纪律严明”等好评。
    （二）本委对各级人民监察委员会工作的建立，亦曾给以若干指导。现在东北、西北、华东、中南四个大行政区的监委已先后成立，各省市监委已成立者有河北、绥远、陕西、甘肃、青海、宁夏、北京市等七处。其中东北大行政区人民监察委员会及河北省人民监察机关因成立较早，已进行许多检查工作，取得了一些经验，并在当地干部与群众中开始建立了人民监察机关的威信。各地人民政府对公务人员之违法失职贪污浪费的检举，亦十分重视，且已发现与解决了许多问题。最近西北军政委员会各直属部门展开了群众性的反不良倾向运动，成绩很大。
    半年以来的监察工作，虽作出一些成绩，但仍有许多缺点，主要是迟缓、被动、赶不上客观的需要。直到现在，因干部缺乏，本委及各大行政区的监委组织尚未健全，许多省市监委会尚未成立，必要的监察制度亦未完全建立，致影响工作。我们的监察工作还是一般地限于事故发生之后，还没有能够在平时进行检查，防患于未然。对于许多重要案件之事后检查，也常感到有不深刻、不全面的毛病。在处理上，多着重于追究责任，虽然也指出了事故原因，发生了一定的教育效果，但提出改进工作的建议，则做得不够。同时因处理手续繁复及缺乏经验，致案件往往拖延很久，也是一个缺点。
    二、自去年广大地区解放以来，我们在接管新区，建立人民政权，消灭土匪，安定社会秩序，支援战争，恢复生产，统一财政，稳定金融物价，战胜灾荒等各方面的工作，均获得了一系列重大的成绩；但在某些部门和某些地区，特别是某些财经机关与企业部门中不断地发生了损害国家财产与人民利益的重大事件。根据最近不完全与不精确的统计，由去年至今年五月。中央各机关及各大行政区共发生大小事件六千一百余件，其中由于违法失职与缺乏经验等所造成的案件占百分之六十以上，由于特务破坏的案件占百分之三十以上，其他责任不明的占百分之七以上。仅就其中一部分曾经估价的统计，竟损失人民币六千八百亿元，另小米七千七百余万斤。更严重的是死伤工人、农民、战士、干部五百三十六人（死四百零五人，伤一百三十一人）。（⑴⑶）
    上述事件发生的原因相当复杂，在企业部门中，由于反动统治的长期摧残，除匪特破坏案件外，其他属于企业中发生的事件，有些是有所接收的工矿业其设备原极陈旧，管理原极腐败，而接管时间又很短，难免不发生事故。有些事件的发生，则主要由于工作人员缺乏经验，而不是由于他们的违法失职。但必须指出，其中不少事故是由于一部分领导者骄傲自满，麻痹大意，特别是他们的官僚主义与命令主义所造成。如东北去年十月至十二月，由于一些工矿部门领导上的麻痹大意，制度不严，纪律松懈，竟失火三百零三次，损失东北币三百八十余亿元。又如上述周知的河南宜洛煤矿灾变事件，是由于煤矿领导人盲目追求生产数字，发动错误的“生产竞赛”与“民主运动”，使煤矿工程遭受破坏，加以采取了压制工人，打击旧人员的办法，并坐视封建把头得势，致造成内部极严重的不团结现象；而这种错误作法延长八个月之久，其上级领导亦未发现，致发生今年二月沼气爆炸的惨痛事件，压死工人一百七十四人，伤二十六人，损失折小麦一百八十余万斤。又如西北农林部门贷放棉种，由于“收购”、“储存”、“试验”、“发放”过程中，存在着一连串的官僚主义，致发给群众的棉种已大量发霉，使大部分地区的棉苗很不好，最坏的只有一成苗，据估计，国家损失三十多亿，群众损失更大，并影响增产棉花的计划。又如郑州铁路局于一九四九年十一月修筑十六座一百二十吨的水塔，由于领导上官僚主义，其不合实际的计划和预算竟被批准，而且包工与采购中发生了形形色色贪污舞弊等情事，倘若不是工人告发，中央派员检查纠正，即将损失小麦九百余万斤。去年某些灾区，亦由于领导上官僚主义，致救灾迟缓，灾情变为严重。如皖北去年七月遭水灾后，轻重灾民八百余万，占全皖北人口近三分之一，但领导上不了解实际情况，认为“不要紧”，直至今年一月灾情万分严重时，才认真重视其生产救灾工作，已为时太晚，造成灾民严重的逃荒与死亡现象。河北省某县某区长为了按时完成种棉任务，不许群众上集（交易市场），拦不住，就亲自跑去鸣枪威吓，群众把集市移到别的地方，他又去威吓了一次。陕西省华阴县一家农民没有种政府发给的棉籽，种了自己的棉籽（实际上比政府发的棉籽出苗好），干部借口他没有采用优良品种，强迫铲掉棉苗，处罚一年不准种棉花。诸如此类的官僚主义、命令主义的例子很多，不必一一列举。这种官僚主义与命令主义，不仅使国家与人民的财产遭受重大损失，且使人民政府与广大人民的密切联系受到阻碍。而且这种官僚主义与命令主义给予匪特分子与违法乱纪分子以可乘之机。这种情况值得我们严重注意。
    根据上述情况和经验，今后人民监察工作须注意做到以下几点：
    １、各级政府在整训干部期间，应集中注意力去纠正各级领导干部的骄傲自满情绪及官僚主义和命令主义作风。纠正的办法是召集工作人员开会，从检查工作进到检查思想作风；在集中领导之下放手发扬民主，展开批评与自我批评。在检查工作和检查思想作风中，要总结工作经验，教育干部，提高政策与业务水平。各级人民政府并应重视人民监察机关的作用，依中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第十九条“在县市以上的各级人民政府内，设人民监察机关，以监察各级国家机关和各种公务人员是否履行其职责，并纠举其中违法失职的机关和人员”之规定，尽快地建立与健全人民监察委员会的组织，给以必要的领导，使能配合政府各项任务，对国家机关及公务人员进行经常的有效的监督检查。
    ２、人民监察委员会的具体任务，就是与政权机关和企业部门中贪污浪费、官僚主义、命令主义和其他违法失职现象作斗争，监督各级机关和各种公务人员认真负责，奉公守法，遵守劳动纪律，全心全意为人民服务。为达此目的，应使经常检查与事故检查有很好的结合。经常地有计划地检查和事故发生后的检查，都是为了发现问题，解决问题，交流经验，纠正缺点，表扬成绩，教育干部，改进工作。事故检查中应注意追究责任，予以适当惩处，因为这是整饬政纪所必要的；但亦应注意发现事故发生前后的模范人员，给以表扬或奖励。
    ３、为使监察工作能起其应有的作用，必须采取与广大群众结合的群众路线。凡检查与处理每一案件时，均须密切结合群众，发动被检查机关的员工和有关群众，进行民主检讨；同时应很好地与主管部门和有关机关密切联系，经过商讨，协力合作。这样能使问题的了解更全面，结论更正确，检查与处理能充分有效。
    ４、建立监察通讯员制度，以便联系群众，掌握情况。各级监察委员会应依据本委行将发布的人民监察通讯员办法，组织人民监察通讯员，经过监察通讯员的方式，物色和吸收群众中积极分子参加监察工作，同他们保持密切联系，收集情况，并认真地接收与处理他们所检举的案件。这是人民监察机关中当前的一件重要工作。
    ５、监察机关与监察人员，既担任了代表国家政权去监督与纠举国家机关与公务人员的职责，自己即应重视自己的职责，积极学习毛主席的思想和作风，熟悉政府的政策和法令，不仅要成为执行政策、遵守法令、认真负责、艰苦奋斗、廉洁朴素、团结群众的模范，更要在检查和处理案件中，以实事求是的大公无私的态度，对事对人，完成人民监察任务。
    三、本委下半年的工作任务：
    （一）工作任务：本委下半年的工作任务是配合整训干部，组织、推动并指导中央各部门及各大行政区与中央直属省、市政府，集中力量，与官僚主义、命令主义以及贪污浪费破坏生产和一切违法失职等坏现象作斗争。工作中心以财经部门为主，同时注意行政机关。争取下半年对国营之主要工厂、矿山、仓库、商店、银行、粮食、税务、交通运输、农林、水利等事业机关以及主要县市的工作，选择其重点十处到十五处进行彻底检查。同时在控告政府机关与公务人员案件中，选择其有重要性者直接检查若干件，得出经验，推广各地。
    （二）工作步骤：本委应就现有力量，以集中使用，重点检查为原则，首先由中央各部门及中央直属省市作起，进一步地推动各大行政区。拟于六月进行准备，七、八、九、十四个月完成重点检查，十一、十二两月总结其工作经验。作为一九五一年开展监察工作的基础。
    （三）健全监察机构：已成立之大行政区及省市监委（包括中央监委），应迅速配备干部，完成编制。未成立人民监察委员会之省、市、县亦应尽可能陆续成立。依据本委建立机关团体监察通讯员办法，争取于九月前完成中央各机关团体建立人民监察通讯员的组织。同时，搜集各地监察工作材料，加以研究，准备在冬季召开全国监察会议，总结经验和讨论一九五一年监察工作问题。
    （四）建立监察制度：为使各级监察机关及其人员在工作中有所遵循，应根据半年来之工作经验，将各级监察委员会组织条例加以修正，呈政务院公布施行，制定公务员惩戒条例，使处分办法、惩戒程序等有统一的规定，以防止实行惩戒时发生畸轻畸重现象。此外加强编辑与研究工作：收集苏联社会主义国家监察工作的理论与法规，收集与整理各级政府监察工作的经验，以作监察人员学习的资料，及制定监察制度的参考。刊发不定期的“人民监察”便于各级监察机关交流工作经验。
