Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier of the Government Administration Council Zhou Enlai promulgated an order, announcing the implementation of the new Provisional Regulations on Railway Military Transportation. The full text of the order is as follows:

	Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission Government Administration Council Order
	1. The revised Provisional Regulations on Railway Military Transportation are hereby promulgated and implemented; it is hoped that all subordinate People's Liberation Army, People's Public Security Forces, and railway workers at all levels will abide by and implement them.
	2. From the date of revision and promulgation, all previously promulgated regulations and laws related to railway military transportation shall be repealed.
	This order.
	Chairman Mao Zedong
	Premier Zhou Enlai
	August 1, 1950

Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council will implement the new "Provisional Regulations on Railway Military Transportation" from August 1st, and at the same time abolish all previously promulgated regulations and laws related to railway military transportation. The regulations stipulate: In terms of freight transportation—all troop units, organs, schools, hospitals, military camps, and factories affiliated with the Military Commission for their relocation, funding, books, archives, ordnance, military medical supplies, military industry, military supplies, communications, transportation construction, finished products of various combat equipment, supplies, and replenishment transportation shall be handled as military transportation. However, the transportation of raw materials or finished products carried out by troops and organs engaged in industrial and agricultural production is not within the scope of military transportation. The railway should differentiate all military transport from general commercial transport, establish separate consignment books, give priority to allocating vehicles, and give priority to transportation. In terms of passenger transport—all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces and the People's Public Security Forces, in full military uniform and holding formal passports, shall enjoy a half-price discount when taking various passenger cars, scattered seats, express trains, and using sleeping berths, regardless of rank. The original quota of 60 people in a covered wagon is now changed to 54 people. Hard-seat military cars are also abolished at the same time. Discharged soldiers with certificates can ride at half price but can only be used once on the way back to their hometown. Military family members and party and government workers who are not in the military system but wear military uniforms are not allowed to purchase half-price tickets. For trains or special trains transporting wounded and sick soldiers, the regulations specifically stipulate that they should be classified as higher-level trains and given priority transportation as much as possible to reduce the suffering of wounded and sick personnel. The regulations also stipulate that troops should submit consignment plans to the railway on schedule, and both parties should guarantee their implementation. If the delay is due to the railway's responsibility, the railway shall be responsible for compensating for the loss. If the realization of the loading plan is affected due to the responsibility of the troops, the troops shall pay a fine in accordance with the regulations. In addition, the regulations also have specific provisions for consignment procedures, loading and unloading, payment, and other methods.
