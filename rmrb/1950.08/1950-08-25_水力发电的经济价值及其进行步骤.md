　　The Economic Value of Hydropower and the Steps to Implement It
　　Huang Yuxian
　　I. Advantages of Hydropower Generation
　　Hydropower and thermal power are the two major pillars of power. Hydropower utilizes an inexhaustible water source, while thermal power relies on finite fuel reserves (coal and oil). Building more hydropower plants can save more fuel for other industrial uses. The planned installed capacity of the Fengman Hydropower Plant is 560,000 kilowatts, with an hourly power generation of 560,000 kilowatt-hours. If we calculate based on the average coal consumption of 0.9 kilograms per kilowatt-hour for thermal power plants in Northeast China, the Fengman Hydropower Plant, upon full completion and operation, can save 500 tons of coal per hour. If the plant's utilization rate is 60%, it can save approximately 7,000 tons of coal per day. This will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the industry in Northeast China.

　　In addition to power generation, hydropower also has functions such as flood control, irrigation, and navigation improvement. If you want to achieve "multiple benefits in one stroke" in developing a certain area, developing hydropower is a very economical and effective method. After the completion of the Fengman Dam, not only will the major floods that occurred along the Songhua River in the past (such as in 1933) not be repeated, but the irrigated farmland will also increase by 200,000 mu. During the dry season, the riverbed can consistently maintain a water level of three meters, allowing smooth passage for ships. This undoubtedly provides great assistance to agriculture, shipping, and the overall national economy of the region.

　　Hydropower, due to its low and reliable cost, is essential for the development of many industries that rely on its inexpensive supply. Aluminum smelting, magnesium smelting, synthetic fertilizer production, caustic soda production, and high-silicon steel smelting are the most obvious examples. The steel industry in Anshan and the timber industry in the upper reaches of the Songhua River also rely on the Fengman Hydropower Plant for development!

　　The construction cost of a hydropower plant is slightly higher compared to a thermal power plant (approximately in the ratio of 100 to 160). However, the majority of the construction cost of a hydropower plant is spent on labor and civil engineering, which benefits the domestic economy. Usually, machinery and equipment only account for 30% to 40% of the total investment, while the rest is used for local labor and building materials.

　　II. Principles of Hydropower Generation

　　Objects or substances with weight, when descending from a high place to a low place, can transform their inherent "potential energy" into useful "work." However, there must be countless objects or substances continuously falling from a high place. Otherwise, after the object or substance falls to a low place, the "potential energy" will disappear. The water flow of rivers originating from high mountains and flowing towards the ocean possesses the three characteristics of weight, head, and continuity, making it a valuable resource that can be utilized.

　　Humans have a long history of utilizing hydropower. In China, as early as the Han and Jin dynasties, there were simple methods such as water-powered mortars, watermills, and waterwheels that utilized the "potential energy" of flowing water and transformed it into "mechanical energy." With the invention of electricity in modern times and the emergence of new water turbines and generators, the scope of hydropower utilization has greatly expanded. Hydropower generation utilizes water by directing the water source at a high position—the driving water—through the intake to the water turbine. Through the action of the water turbine, the "potential energy" inherent in the driving water is converted into mechanical energy, and further converted into electrical energy by the generator, which is transmitted to the location of electricity consumption through transmission lines. The water used by the water turbine is discharged through the tailrace.

　　Flow rate and head are the two major elements that constitute the working capacity of water. Flow rate is the amount of water flowing per unit time, usually measured in cubic meters per second. Head is the drop in water level, usually measured in meters. Approximately, one cubic meter per second of flow rate and one meter of head can generate ten horsepower. Multiplying the horsepower by three-quarters yields the generated power in kilowatts. Flow rate and head are equally important. If the flow rate is large but the head is small, the hydropower will not be significant; similarly, if the head is large but the flow rate is small, the hydropower will not be significant. The utilization of large amounts of hydropower must have both a large flow rate and a large head simultaneously, and this large flow rate and large head must also have reliable continuity. This is why hydropower workers usually strive to improve the head and regulate the flow rate through engineering methods.

　　The method of regulating flow rate is usually to build a dam to impound water, so that the water level and flow rate in the reservoir behind the dam do not change too much under artificial control. There are two ways to increase the head: weir type and water conduit type. The water turbine is located near the dam or inside the dam body, only utilizing the drop at the dam construction site, which is called the weir type. The water turbine is located at a lower location further away from the dam, and the required amount of water is transported through a water conduit, which is called the water conduit type.

　　III. Principles of Hydropower Development

　　The principles of hydropower development are, first, to pay attention to the size of the investment, and second, to pay attention to the value of the development. Generating the greatest value with the least investment is in line with the highest economic principle and the basic requirements of hydropower development.

　　The size of the investment depends on the geographical environment of the dam site and the technology of the engineering quality. An excellent dam site and appropriate design are the main factors in reducing investment costs. An excellent dam site means that the dam construction site simultaneously possesses the following conditions:

　　(1) The location is appropriate and safe. Convenient external transportation, without the need to extend the transmission range too far.
　　(2) The flow rate is reliable and evenly distributed, with monthly, seasonal, and annual variations that are not too large.
　　(3) The natural head is large and concentrated. A higher head can be obtained by building a very low dam.
　　(4) The geological foundation is strong and stable, without water leakage, seepage, or fracture phenomena. At the same time, foundation excavation and rock extraction are also relatively convenient.
　　(5) The river valley is narrow, the banks are neat, and there is suitable terrain behind the dam for water storage (with relatively small inundation losses). There are excellent locations in front of the dam for building a plant.
　　(6) The water quality is clean and the sediment content is low.
　　(7) Other factors, such as labor and building materials, can also be resolved locally.

　　Appropriate design means that the design technology must be coordinated with local conditions (including both natural and social aspects). After detailed comparison and research, the most economical and effective method is sought. This includes science and art, and there are countless variations with very few similarities.

　　The magnitude of the development value is directly related to the benefits of power generation, flood control, irrigation, and navigation. Hidden behind these benefits is the substantial progress of industry, agriculture, water conservancy, and even the entire regional economy. Therefore, the sum of the value of power generation, flood control, irrigation, and navigation, and the depth of its impact on the regional economy should be the most basic yardstick for measuring the development value. It is worth mentioning here that hydropower development can improve the economy of a certain region, but it cannot be generalized that the economy of every region can be equally improved and developed due to hydropower development. It is necessary to compare and study the natural and social environment of each region, determine the priority of regional development, and select the most economical hydropower locations in the planned development area for engineering construction. A Soviet expert said: "The basic method of designing hydropower plants in the Soviet Union is to study and compare several schemes of different construction forms, and select the most economical, technically complete, and beneficial scheme in terms of hydropower construction." This cautious and responsible spirit is worth emulating by Chinese hydropower workers.

　　IV. Steps in Hydropower Plant Construction

　　In order to judge and carefully select the most economical and beneficial areas for hydropower generation engineering construction, the completion of each hydropower plant must go through four stages: surveying, planning, design, and construction.

　　(1) Surveying: Divided into reconnaissance survey and detailed survey, the overall purpose is to collect information on engineering and economic aspects, and conduct a general study of the economic value of regional development and the possibility of hydropower utilization.

　　(a) Reconnaissance Survey: Select areas with development value. Experienced engineering and technical personnel conduct a general investigation of the hydropower resources of rivers or river systems in the area. Select one or several of the best dam construction sites, and prepare preliminary reports and sketches to determine their suitability.

　　(b) Detailed Survey: Based on the locations indicated in the reconnaissance survey report, further detailed investigation or detailed examination of hydrology, topography, geology, economy, and other related aspects is conducted.

　　The hydrological aspects include water level, flow rate, sediment content, evaporation, rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, etc. If there are long-term reliable records in the past, collect the records of the above items, analyze and study them, and prepare various curve diagrams. If there are no long-term reliable records, establish hydrological stations to record the actual daily changes of the above items for a long time.

　　The topographical aspects include the measurement and mapping of dam sites, plant buildings, diversion channels, reservoirs, and transportation routes, etc.

　　The geological aspects include the geological investigation of the dam site, reservoir, and the entire basin. Geological drilling work must also be carried out for the foundations of the dam foundation, plant foundation, and other buildings.

　　The economic aspects include the inundation losses in the reservoir area and the general economic survey of the entire basin. This leads to research on resettlement, transfer, or employment methods for residents in the reservoir area, selection of industrial and commercial locations, distribution of electricity uses, and prospects for the overall economic development of the region.

　　(2) Planning: Comprehensively analyze the reliable data provided by the survey report, and more completely and thoughtfully compare and study the various topics within it to determine a final and economical development plan. The topics that need to be studied in this stage are:

　　(a) Hydrological Research: Estimate the maximum flood peak and volume to determine the height and length of the spillway dam and the size of the reservoir. And determine the minimum flow rate and average flow rate to study the relationship between reservoir regulation and electricity.

　　(b) Power Research: Determine the installed capacity and the number of units from the load required by the power market (current and future), and study the size of reliable power and secondary power, and the method of coordinating hydropower and thermal power.

　　(c) Engineering Plan Comparison: Compare the advantages and disadvantages of various dam sites and engineering layouts to find the most suitable decision.

　　(d) Multi-Purpose Utilization Research: Conduct comprehensive research on irrigation, navigation, flood control, water supply, fish farming, and power generation, and make appropriate coordination. It is hoped that the construction of a hydropower project can promote the development of the entire basin or the entire regional economy.

　　(e) Economic Research: Summarize the construction cost, annual expenses, development benefits - annual benefits, and other benefits of the project to determine its development value, and observe the depth of its impact on the overall regional national economy.

　　(3) Design: After the engineering plan is determined, the civil engineering aspects will carry out detailed design of structures such as dams, water intake equipment, diversion channels, penstocks, plant buildings, and gate valves, and draw drawings to formulate construction specifications, and calculate the amount of engineering work as the basis for actual construction on the construction site. In terms of machinery and electricity, it is necessary to formulate specifications for water turbines and generators, design various oil, water, and ventilation pipes, power transmission, substation, and distribution equipment, and contact manufacturers to order machines, draw drawings, and formulate construction specifications to facilitate the installation on the construction site.

　　(4) Construction: According to the design drawings, formulate a construction plan, including the design of drainage and cofferdams, the layout of the construction site, building structure, material testing, sand, stone, cement, and other equipment mining and transportation.

　　Based on the above facts, we know that the construction of a hydropower plant requires a long period of preparation or research. Hydropower workers must have specialized technology and broad comprehensive knowledge. The establishment of large-scale hydropower plants requires appropriate coordination with thermal power, water conservancy, and other related industries.

　　V. China's Hydropower Industry

　　China is a country with very rich hydropower resources. According to recent estimates, the national hydropower resource reserve that can be utilized 95% of the time in a year is 74 million kilowatts, and the amount that can be utilized 50% of the time is 149 million kilowatts. Such a huge figure ranks second in the world only after the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, our rich hydropower resources have not been properly utilized in the past. The hydropower plants that have been developed domestically have a capacity of 665,000 kilowatts, accounting for only 0.89% of the hydropower resources that can be utilized 50% of the time. Moreover, 98% of this was built by the Japanese invaders when they occupied Northeast China, Taiwan, and Hainan Island to carry out their war of aggression, exploiting the blood and sweat of our people. The capacity built by the Chinese themselves is only about 14,000 kilowatts.

　　The establishment of hydropower construction and surveying organizations in China began in 1933. In these short ten years, the spirit of Chinese hydropower workers, struggling arduously against nature under adverse political conditions, has always been brave and commendable. Year after year, they explored and developed the resources of the motherland in remote mountains and rivers, not afraid of hardship or difficulty, and silently did pioneering work. Today, as mentioned above, we have a rough idea of the amount of hydropower resources in China. We have also conducted on-site reconnaissance surveys or detailed surveys of more than 400 rivers or river systems with development value, totaling more than 50 million kilowatts. For the better dam construction sites among them, planning and design work has been further carried out. The construction of civil engineering and the manufacturing of mechanical and electrical equipment were initially entirely dependent on foreigners. Gradually, we progressed to Chinese people hosting engineering projects and foreigners supplying mechanical and electrical equipment. Today, Chinese hydropower workers can handle medium-sized and smaller civil engineering projects with ease. Domestic manufacturers with experience can also imitate water turbines and generators with a capacity of 10,000 kilowatts or less. In the southwest and northwest regions, twenty or thirty small hydropower plants have been built, although the capacity is only over 10,000 kilowatts, it has accumulated a lot of valuable experience for Chinese hydropower workers. In other words, China's hydropower industry has built a preliminary and weak foundation.

　　It cannot be denied that in the past, due to the limitations of the political environment and the lack of political awareness of the engineering personnel themselves, there were many shortcomings and mistakes in the budding stage of China's hydropower industry as it groped forward. However, under today's new political environment, I believe that these shortcomings and mistakes can be gradually overcome. The National Hydropower Engineering Conference recently held in Beijing summarized the advantages and disadvantages of China's hydropower industry in the past in a critical spirit, and clearly established a new working policy for China's hydropower industry:

　　(1) In the next three to five years, China's hydropower industry should cooperate with the urgent needs of industrial water conservancy and agriculture, continue to carry out construction projects for hydropower plants that have already started and have economic value, and strive to complete them as soon as possible.

　　(2) In order to meet the power needs of industry in the near future, plan construction work in several areas where exploration and planning work have been largely completed.

　　(3) In order to promote the development of small-scale rural hydropower, technically assist local governments, cooperatives, or private enterprises in certain areas to focus on the construction of several small hydropower plants. In the old liberated areas where land reform has been completed, the central government will select appropriate locations to build plants as a demonstration to promote the development of agricultural production and cultivate the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers.

　　(4) In order to complete the arduous task of hydropower engineering construction in the future, it is necessary to overcome departmentalism, strengthen the overall concept, and unify the leadership of surveying, planning, design, and construction work nationwide. The main equipment of hydropower institutions in various places must also be uniformly allocated in order to achieve effective and concentrated use. Due to the current shortage of hydropower technology cadres, we should actively and systematically train talents. The existing technical cadres should focus on investigation and design work.

　　This is the new working direction of China's hydropower industry, and also the beginning of the new life of China's hydropower industry.

　　水力发电的经济价值及其进行步骤
    黄育贤
    一、水力发电的优点
    水力发电与火力发电是动力中的两大支柱，水力发电所用的，是永无穷尽的水源，火力发电所用的，是蕴藏有限的燃料（煤和油），多建设一部分水电厂，即可多节省一部分燃料作工业上其他的用途。丰满水电厂计划装置容量是五十六万千瓦，每小时的发电量即是五十六万度。如照东北一般火电厂每度电平均耗煤○·九公斤计算，丰满水电厂全部完成供电后，每小时可省煤五百吨，电厂利用率如以百分之六十计，则每天约可省煤七千吨，这对于东北的工业，该会引起如何的影响。
    水力发电除了发电之外，还有控制洪水，引水灌溉，改善航道的功能，要想“一举数得”的开发某一个区域，举办水力发电，是极经济而有效的办法。丰满堤坝完成后，不但松花江沿岸过去（如一九三三年）所发生的大水灾不致重演，受灌溉利益的田亩，亦增加了二十万亩。在枯水时期，河床经常可保持三公尺深的水位，船舶往来，通行无阻。这对于农业、航运和全区的国民经济，无疑的有极大的帮助。
    水力发电由于成本低廉而可靠，有许多工业是必须依赖它的廉价供应，才能发展的。炼铝，炼镁，制淡肥，制烧碱，炼高矽钢等，就是最明显的例子。鞍山的钢铁工业和松花江上游的木材工业，也是依靠丰满水电厂而发展起来的！
    水力发电厂的建筑费与火力发电厂比，是稍高一点。（大约是一○○与一六○之比）不过，水电厂大部分的建筑费，是用在人工和土木工程方面，是用于国内的。通常机器设备只占投资总额百分之三十至四十，其余都是用在当地人工和建筑材料方面。
    二、水力发电的原理
    具有重量的物体或物质，由高处降落至低处的时候，都能将其所蕴蓄的“位能”变为有益之“功”。但必须有无数的物体或物质连续的由高处下落。否则，物体或物质下落至低处后，“位能”就会消除的。源自高山流向海洋的江河的水流恰恰具备了重量，落差和连续的三种特性，就成为可以利用的宝贵资源。
    人类利用水力工作的历史很长，我们中国远自汉晋的时候，就有所谓水碓、水磨和水车等利用流水的“位能”，转变为“机械能”的简陋方法。到了近代电力发明，新式水轮机和发电机逐一出现后，水力利用的范围更大大扩展。水力发电利用水的方法，是将高位置的水源——原动力水，经进水口导入输水路，达到水轮机。因水轮机的作用，将原动力水中所蕴蓄的“位能”，转变为机械能，更由发电机转变为电能，由输电线传导至用电地点。经水轮机用过的水量，由尾水路泄出去。
    流量和水头是构成水的工作能力的两大要素，流量就是每单位时间所流过的水量，普通以秒立方公尺计。水头就是水的落差，普通以公尺计。大约的估计，有一秒立方公尺的流量和一公尺的水头，即可得十马力，以马力数乘四分之三，即得所发的电量千瓦数。流量和水头是同样的重要，若是流量很大而水头很小，则水力不会大；同样的，若是水头很大而流量很小，则水力也不会大。大量水力的利用，一定要同时有大的流量和大的水头，而这种大的流量和大的水头，还要有其可靠的连续性。水电工作者通常致力用工程的方法来提高水头和调节流量的原因就在这里。
    调节流量的办法，普通都是筑坝壅水，使坝后水库中的水位和流量，在人工控制下，不致变化过大。提高水头的办法，一种是堰堤式，一种是水路式。水轮机设在堤坝附近或坝身之内，只利用筑坝地点的落差的，谓之堰堤式。水轮机设在距坝较远较低之处，用输水路输运所需用的水量的，谓之水路式。
    三、水力开发的原则
    水力开发的原则，第一要注意投资的大小，第二要注意开发的价值，以最少的投资，产生最大的价值，才合乎经济的最高原则，才合乎水力开发的基本要求。
    投资的大小，决定于坝址的地理环境和工程质量的技术，优良的坝址和适当的设计是减低投资费用的主要因素。所谓优良的坝址，是说在建坝的地点，同时具备了下述的几种条件：
    （１）位置适中安全。对外交通方便，输电范围无需引伸过远。
    （２）流量可靠，分配均匀，月变化，季变化，年变化并不太大。
    （３）天然落差大而集中，只要建造很低的坝，就可得较高的水头。
    （４）地质基础坚强稳固，无透水，漏水和断裂的现象。同时基础开挖和石方采取亦比较方便。
    （５）河谷狭窄，崖岸整齐，坝后有足资蓄水的适当地形（淹没损失并不太大）。坝前有便于建厂的优良处所。
    （６）水质清净，含沙量少。
    （７）其他如劳动力，建筑材料……等，亦可就地解决。
    所谓适当的设计，是说设计的技术一定要与地方条件（包括自然与社会两方面）相配合，经过详尽的比较，研究，而求出最经济的有效的方法。这里面包含了科学，也包含了艺术，千变万化，绝少雷同。
    开发价值的大小，与发电、防洪、灌溉、航运等项利益有着直接的关系。隐藏在这几项利益后面的，是工业、农业、和水利事业甚至整个区域经济的长足进展。因之，发电、防洪、灌溉、和航运价值的总和及其对于区域经济影响程度的深浅，应是衡量开发价值最基本的标尺。在这里，值得提出来声明的，是水力的开发，可以改进某一区域的经济，但不能笼统的说，每一区域的经济，都能因水力的开发而有同等的改善，同样的发展。一定要比较研究每一个区域的自然与社会的环境分别轻重缓急决定区域开发的先后程序，并在计划开发的区域内，选择最经济的水力地点进行工程的建设。一位苏联专家说：“苏联水力发电厂设计的基本方法是研拟和比较不同缔造形式的几个方案，并于其中选择在水电施工方面最经济的，技术完整的和有利的方案。”这种审慎，负责的精神，是值得我们中国水电工作者效法的。
    四、水电厂建设的步骤
    为了判断和慎选最经济而有利的地区，进行水力发电工程的建设，每一水力发电厂的完成，必须经过勘测、规划、设计和营造等四个阶段。
    （１）勘测：分踏勘和详勘二种，总的目的在搜集有关工程和经济方面的资料，概要的研究区域开发的经济价值，和水力利用的可能性。
    （一）踏勘：选择富有开发价值的区域，由经验丰富的工程技术人员，进行该区河流或河系水力资源的普遍调查，选择其中最优良的建坝地点一处或数处，制出初步的报告和草图来判定其适宜的程度。
    （二）详勘：根据踏勘报告所指出的地点进一步的进行水文、地形、地质、经济及其他有关方面的详勘或细查的工作。
    水文方面是包括水位流量，含沙量，蒸发量，雨量，温度，湿度，风向，风速等，如过去已有长期可靠的记录，则搜集上述各项目的记录，予以分析研究，并制出各类曲线图。如无长期可靠的记录，则设立水文站，长期记录上述各项目逐日变易的实际数字。
    地形方面是包括坝址，厂房、引水道、水库及交通路线等的测量及制图。
    地质方面是包括坝址、水库和整个流域的地质调查；坝基、厂基，及其他建筑物的基础，尚须进行地质的钻探工作。
    经济方面是包括水库区的淹没损失及全流域一般经济的调查。从而研究水库中居民迁徙，转业或就业的办法，工商业区位的抉择，电力用途的分配和整个区域经济发展的展望等。
    （２）规划：综合勘测报告所供给的可靠的资料，更完整周到的比较研究其中的各个课题，决定一最终的、经济的开发方案，在这一阶段中所须研究的课题是：
    （一）水文研究：推算最大洪水峰与量，以决定溢水坝的高度、长度及水库的大小。并确定最小流量和平均流量，以研究水库调节同电力的关系。
    （二）电力研究：从电力市场所需要的负荷（目前及将来的）决定装机容量同机数，并研究其中可靠电力，次等电力的大小与水火电配合的方法。
    （三）工程计划比较：比较各坝址，各型工程布置的优点与缺点，而求一最适宜的决定。
    （四）多元利用研究：对灌溉，航运，防洪，给水，渔殖，电力作全盘的研究，作适当的配合，希望能由一个水力工程的建筑，推动全流域或整个区域经济的发展。
    （五）经济研究：总结本工程的建造成本，每年费用，开发利益——年利益及其他利益，用以决定其开发价值，并观察其对于整个区域国民经济影响程度的深浅。
    （３）设计：工程计划确定后，土木方面即进行堤坝，进水设备，引水道，输水管，厂房，闸阀等结构方面的详细设计，并绘制图样拟订施工规范，计算工程数量，作为工地实际施工的依据。机电方面则须拟订水轮机，发电机的规范，设计各种油，水，通气管子，输电，变电，配电设备，并与厂家联系，订购机器，绘制图样，拟订施工规范，以便工地的装置。
    （４）营造：根据设计图样，拟订施工计划，其中包括排水及围堰的设计，工场的布置，建筑结构，材料试验，沙，石，洋灰，及其他器材的采运等。
    基于上述的事实，我们知道水电厂的建筑，须有一个长时期的准备或研究的阶段。从事水力发电的工作人员，须有专门的技术，也须有广泛的综合的知识。大规模水电厂的建立，尤须与火电、水利及其他有关的事业作适当的配合。
    五、中国水力发电事业
    中国是一个水力资源非常丰富的国家，据最近估计，全国水力资源的蕴藏量，一年中百分之九十五时间可以利用的，为七千四百万千瓦，百分之五十时间可以利用的，为一万四千九百万千瓦。这样一个庞大的数字，是仅次于苏联而高居世界第二位的。可惜的是，我们丰富的水力资源，在过去并没有得到适当的利用，国内已经开发的水电厂，是六十六万五千千瓦，只占百分之五十时间可以利用的水力资源百分之零点八十九，而且其中的百分之九十八还是日寇侵占东北、台湾、和海南岛时为进行侵略战争而利用我国人民血汗所建造起来的，国人自己兴建的，不过一万四千千瓦左右。
    水力发电的建设与勘测机构，在我国创立的时间，是始于一九三三年，在这短短的十几年中，中国水电工作者，在恶劣的政治环境下，与大自然艰巨斗争的精神，一直是英勇可佩的。常年累月在穷山恶水中，探寻和开发祖国的资源，不怕苦，不怕难，默默地做披荆斩棘的工作。到今天，对于中国水力资源的蕴藏量，如上文所述，已有了一个粗略的概念。具有开发价值的河流或河系，还做了四百余处五千余万千瓦的实地踏勘或详勘的工作。其中比较优良的建坝地点，更进一步的做了规划和设计的工作。土木工程的建筑，机电设备的制造，最初我们是全部依赖外国人，逐渐进步到国人主办工程，外国人供给机电设备，到今天，中型以下的土木工程，国内水电工作者，固可应付裕如，一万千瓦以下的水轮机和发电机，国内有经验的厂家，亦可仿制了。在西南西北一带，也曾建造了一二十个小型水电厂，虽然数量只有一万余千瓦，但给中国水电工作者，积累了不少可宝贵的经验。也就是说，中国水电事业，已建起了一个初步的微弱的基础。
    不可否认的，过去由于政治环境的限制和工程人员本身政治觉悟程度的不够，中国水电事业在摸索前进的萌芽阶段中，是存在着很多的缺点，也犯了不少的错误，但是在今天新的政治环境下，这些缺点同错误，我相信是可以逐步克服的。最近在北京召开的全国水力发电工程会议，就以批判的精神，总结了过去中国水电事业的优点同缺点，并明确的建立了中国水电事业新的工作方针：
    （１）在今后三五年内，中国水力发电事业应配合工业水利事业和农业的急切需要，对于过去已经兴工而具有经济价值的水电厂，继续进行建设工程，并争取早日完成。
    （２）为配合最近将来工业上的动力需要，在探勘及计划工作已大致完成的若干地区，筹划建厂工作。
    （３）为推广农村小型水力的开发，在技术上要协助某些区域的地方政府，合作社，或私营企业，有重点地建设若干小型水力发电厂。在土地改革已经完成的老解放区，中央政府选择适当地点建厂，作为示范，以促进农业生产的发展，培养广大农民的购买力。
    （４）为完成今后水力发电工程建设的艰巨任务，必须克服本位主义。加强整体观念，统一领导全国范围内的勘测，规划，设计与施工等工作。各地水电机构的主要器材亦须统一调配，以期达到有效和集中使用的目的。由于目前水力发电技术干部的缺乏，应积极的，有计划的培养人才。现有的技术干部有重点的放在调查与设计工作上。
    这是中国水电事业新的工作方向，也是中国水电事业新生的开始。
