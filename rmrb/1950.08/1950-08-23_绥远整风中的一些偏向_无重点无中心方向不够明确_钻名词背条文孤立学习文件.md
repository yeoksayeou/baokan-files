　　Suiyuan Daily News: Since late July, Party organizations at all levels (prefecture, county, banner) and in provincial-level agencies in Suiyuan have successively entered the rectification study phase. Initially, most Party organizations in provincial agencies formulated practical rectification plans based on their specific situations. The Provincial Finance Department planned to combine the rectification with preparations for the autumn grain collection, using last year's autumn grain collection as a key area for inspection. Within this overall inspection scope, each section and bureau of the department further specified its own key areas for inspection. The Jining County Party Committee originally planned to inspect not only the county Party committee leadership in August but also the leadership of county and district departments and a portion of cadres, aiming for a comprehensive rectification from top to bottom. After studying the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the report of Comrade Gao Kelin, the original plan was revised to first rectify the county-level leadership and then the general cadres. However, the following problems still exist: (1) Apart from the directly subordinate Party committee system of the province, what specific problems other systems need to address in this rectification campaign, how to carry out the rectification, and to what extent are all unclear. This has led to a phenomenon of "wait and see," lacking a central purpose or direction. Although some counties claim to rectify the leadership first, in practice, they rectify the county and district simultaneously or focus on rectifying the district. Most district cadres attending meetings in Guisui County are thinking more about personal issues than about overall leadership issues. The mood of focusing on individuals is quite serious. (2) There are no clear instructions from the leadership on how to combine study with work inspection, and everyone lacks methods, resulting in rote memorization of terms or getting bogged down in some secondary issues, engaging in endless, aimless discussions. In terms of study requirements, it is also inappropriate to require all cadres, regardless of their cultural and political levels, to study documents carefully and grasp their spirit and essence. Requirements should be differentiated, and specific assistance should be provided. (3) Some comrades one-sidedly believe that work inspection is solely about finding faults, lacking a comprehensive view of promoting achievements and advantages while overcoming shortcomings. Therefore, they neglect to provide suggestions for improving work. (4) There is a phenomenon of isolated rectification. In a few areas, after a very serious insect infestation occurred, the leadership did not try to solve it or report it to higher levels but instead shut themselves off for rectification, allowing the infestation to spread. This is a mistaken separation and opposition between rectification and current work. The leading organs in various areas should pay special attention to solving the above problems.

　　绥远整风中的一些偏向
    无重点无中心方向不够明确
    钻名词背条文孤立学习文件
    【本报讯】绥远日报消息：绥远各地、盟、县、旗委和省级机关党的组织，七月下旬以来先后进入整风学习。首先省级各机关党的组织大部分根据自己的具体情况，订出了切合实际的整风计划。省府财政厅计划结合准备秋征，将去年秋征作为检查重点之一。该厅各科、局在这一总的检查范围内，再分别规定出自己的检查重点。集宁县委原来计划在八月份内，除检查县委领导外，还检查县、区各部门领导和一部分干部，要上下一齐整。在学习省委指示及高克林同志报告以后，修改了原来计划，先整县级领导，然后再整一般。但另一方面，目前还存在下列几个问题：（一）除省直属党委系统外，其他系统究竟要在此次整风中解决些什么问题，怎样整法，以及整到什么程度？都是不够明确的，因之发生走着看，看着走等无中心无目的的现象。有的县份虽也说首先整好领导，但实际作法则是县、区并整，或着重整区。兴和县委以为县领导无甚可检查，一下即进入检查区级工作。归绥县到县开会的各区干部，大部分想个人问题多，考虑全盘领导问题少。整个人的情绪，相当严重。二、在学习中如何结合检查工作，领导上也没有明确指示，大家也缺少办法，因之死钻名词，或纠缠在一些次要问题上，漫无边际乱谈。在学习要求上，对文化水平和政治水平高低不同的干部，一律要求他们精读文件，领会精神与实质，也是不妥当的。应分别要求，并进行具体帮助。三、有些同志对检查工作，片面的认为是专找岔子，缺乏发扬成绩优点，克服缺点的全面观点。因此忽视提供改进工作等意见。四、有孤立整风的现象。有少数地区在发生很严重的虫灾后，领导上不设法去解决，也不向上级反映，却闭门整风，让虫灾蔓延发展。这是错误地把整风与当前的工作完全分离对立起来。以上几个问题，各地领导机关，应特别注意加以解决。
