　　We Have the Determination and Strength to Defend World Peace
    E Jixian, Political Instructor of the Great Merit Seventh Company of a certain unit of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army
    Editor's Note: Comrade E Jixian is currently the political instructor of the Great Merit Seventh Company of a certain unit of the North China Military Region. On July 31st, he represented the company in a broadcast to the nation on the Central People's Broadcasting Station to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In April 1947, during the battle to liberate Zhengding City and completely annihilate the Hou Ruyong bandit troops, this company collectively established a great merit. Subsequently, in various battles, they have been able to bravely complete the combat tasks given by the Party, and in the Xushui battle in July 1948 and the Beixin Canal encirclement and blocking battle in Zhangjiakou in December of the same year, they created amazing results. The Beixin Canal battle was commended by the Central Military Commission and the Corps. This article is the text of Comrade E Jixian's broadcast on the Central People's Broadcasting Station (slightly revised by this newspaper).
    Dear compatriots across the country! Comrades! Today is the 23rd anniversary of the founding of our People's Liberation Army. All of us comrades are very happy. Over the past 23 years, our People's Liberation Army has gone through heroic and arduous struggles and has continuously developed and grown stronger. Now it has become a powerful force to defend our motherland and defend world peace. Today, the Central People's Broadcasting Station invited me to speak, and I think it is very meaningful to talk to you about some stories of our company in the War of Liberation today:
    In April 1947, the People's Liberation Army conducted a battle in Zhengding County, in central Hebei Province, to completely annihilate more than 5,000 bandits of the Hou Ruyong bandit troops. In this siege battle, our Seventh Company completed the task of assaulting and scaling the city at the southern corner, opening a breakthrough, and seizing a large number of weapons in street fighting. It was commended by the higher authorities, and the entire company was awarded a great merit and won the glorious title of "First Merit Company for Scaling Zhengding City." The Fourth and Seventh Special Merit Squads, Special Class Merit recipients Huang Shutian and Wang Ru, and Great Merit recipients such as Liu Zhenjiang and Xin Ying emerged.
    The battle started on April 9th, and the outer strongholds were quickly cleared. After entering Nanguan, we repaired fortifications overnight, continued to scout the terrain and the enemy's firepower deployment, and selected a charging route. After all preparations were completed, the Seventh Squad, led by Huang Shutian, who was responsible for setting up the scaling ladders, and the Fourth Squad, led by Wang Ru, who was responsible for the task of climbing the city for assault, held a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" to specifically study and formulate a combat plan.
    On the afternoon of April 11th, as the sun was about to set, a comprehensive artillery barrage began to bombard the city, suppressing the enemy so they dared not raise their heads. After two large shells destroyed the bunkers on the city tower, Huang Shutian's Seventh Squad lifted the scaling ladder, weighing more than 500 kilograms, and rushed out from the charging starting point, which was more than 100 meters away from the city wall. They quickly rushed to the base of the city wall, threw four grenades, and leaned the ladder against the wall. The enemy kept throwing grenades down, but the comrades of the Seventh Squad disregarded everything, desperately holding the ladder. At this time, Comrade Liu Zhenjiang of the Fourth Squad led his assault team and rushed up first. Before they even reached the top of the ladder, the enemy tried to push the ladder away. The ladder was too heavy to move, so the enemy grabbed a few large bricks and smashed them down hard. Liu Zhenjiang's entire team was injured and slid down the rope that was pulled down from the top of the ladder. At this time, the assault team and the ladder team threw grenades at the city together. Comrade Wang Ru, deputy leader of the Fourth Squad, led the second assault team and quickly climbed onto the top of the city. It took a total of fifteen minutes from the start of the general offensive to the scaling of the city. But as soon as Wang Ru climbed onto the parapet, forty enemies rushed up. Our brave and tenacious People's fighters raised their grenades and threw them at the enemy. Then, they raised their bayonets and glared with both eyes, charging towards more than forty enemies alone, repelling the enemy. The follow-up troops continued to go up, developing positions to the left and right, driving the enemy off the city, consolidating and expanding the breakthrough on the city, blasting open the south gate, opening up a way forward for the follow-up troops, and quickly resolving the battle.
    After completing the task of assaulting and scaling the city, the entire company unanimously requested to participate in the street fighting from the higher authorities. We brought into play our brave and resourceful spirit, using a very small force to eliminate an enemy regimental headquarters, capturing more than 200 enemies and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition.
    From then on, the resounding names of the Seventh Company of the 14th Regiment, Wang Ru, Huang Shutian... spread everywhere. From then on, the Seventh Company, along with the North China Army, advanced and fought in areas such as the Zhengtai Line, Jinnan, Baobei, Daqinghebei, Chabei, Suiyuan, and Taiyuan, completing the combat tasks given by the higher authorities, training and strengthening ourselves, and creating amazing results again in the Xushui battle of the Baobei campaign and the Beixin Canal blocking battle of the Pingzhang campaign.
    In the Xushui battle in July 1948, the Seventh Company did not undertake the assault task, but when the explosives to blast the city sounded, everyone was so happy that they could not restrain themselves. At that time, Comrade Huang Shutian had been promoted to deputy company commander of the Seventh Company. He led a platoon and rushed up, leaning the ladder against the city and scaling it. Some felt that climbing the ladder was too slow, so they climbed up from the collapsed city gate tower. Seeing that the enemy was running down, Comrade Huang Shutian and Lei Da, deputy leader of the Second Squad, led the Fourth Squad and rushed into the city. At this time, the enemy was still blocking the city slope. Han Deshan, deputy leader of the First Squad, led a combat team, jumped out of the trench on the city, hugged their rifles, and rolled down the city slope. After they occupied a courtyard, they found that there were still enemies in several air-raid shelters on the city wall slope. Huang Shutian immediately ordered a team from the Fourth Squad to blast them. At that time, two enemy heavy machine guns in the northwest corner were blocking the road, but no one could care about that much. Huang Shutian himself also rushed up. Everyone took turns crawling at several cave entrances, shouting: "Surrender! Surrender and you won't be killed! Otherwise, we'll throw grenades in!" The enemy didn't say anything and even tried to resist. The soldiers of the Fourth Squad threw large grenades into the cave, and the enemy shouted and screamed: "Don't shoot, we surrender..." One by one, they raised their hands and crawled out of the cave. At the same time, Huang Shutian's head was pierced by a heavy machine gun bullet, leaving a deep groove. Blood flowed down his face, but he didn't groan. He bandaged the wound and continued to command the battle. When finally capturing the large fortress in the northwest corner, he personally fired more than 20 rounds of 60mm mortar shells. In this battle, the Seventh Company captured more than 280 enemies.
    In the autumn of 1948, we followed the large army to advance into Suiyuan, liberating cities and vast rural areas such as Fengzhen and Baotou. In December of the same year, the troops received new missions to participate in the Pingzhang campaign. We quickly marched from the Suiyuan front to the Zhangjiakou area, encircling Zhangjiakou and preventing the enemy from escaping, waiting for an opportunity to annihilate them in one fell swoop. On December 9th, the enemy concentrated two infantry divisions and nearly a thousand cavalry troops to launch an offensive against the positions between Ningyuanbao and Qingshuihe, south of Zhangjiakou, attempting to break through and escape.
    Our Seventh Company was serving as the vanguard of this section of the defensive line. On the 8th, the Seventh Company was fighting the enemy all day, finally defeating a group charge by an enemy regiment. On the morning of the 9th, the enemy concentrated four regiments of troops to launch a frenzied attack on the Seventh Company's position. Everyone held the determination to resolutely complete the task, staring intently at the enemy charging from afar. The enemy was like mad dogs, or like clumsy pigs, each carrying backpacks, leather boots, and dry food bags, holding guns and bending over, charging towards the Seventh Company's position. Our soldiers did not move until the enemy was 50 or 60 meters away, then suddenly began firing volley rifles and bombing with volley grenades. After the group of enemies in front were defeated by us, the enemy used artillery fire to retaliate. A large number of shells hit our positions, and the soil buried the soldiers. They crawled out of the soil and continued to fight. The enemy was forced to charge up by the supervision team's submachine guns for the second, third time... and was defeated by us for the second, third time...
    At this time, the Eighth Company's position was broken through by the enemy, and our Seventh Company was already in a situation where it was surrounded on all sides. The soldiers used grenades to open a path, broke out of the encirclement, established contact with the battalion headquarters, and guarded the new position, striking the enemy. Later, Special Merit Company Commander Huang Shutian raised his pistol and shouted: "Comrades, the higher authorities call on us to hold the position and not lose an inch of ground, and resolutely block the enemy! Comrades, follow me!" He led the team and rushed out. Dong Zhipeng also carried his machine gun and followed Company Commander Huang, rushing to the front of the stone bridge, only dozens of meters away from the enemy, and fought the enemy with grenades. When the machine gun was broken, they used rifles to fight. When the grenades were used up, they took grenades from the enemy's dead bodies and threw them at the enemy again. After a fierce battle, they finally took back the Seventh Company's position and continued to attack the fleeing enemy. At this time, Comrade Huang Shutian had been wounded in three places, especially the wound on his buttocks, which prevented him from running. The battalion and regimental leaders repeatedly asked him to go down, but he resolutely refused to go down, and continued to command the entire company to fight while gritting his teeth. Later, under the unified command of the regimental headquarters, our entire company launched three comprehensive counter-attacks. Each squad and platoon, and even a few people who were temporarily organized, automatically counterattacked the enemy. Sometimes, the soldiers were only a few meters away from the enemy, or separated by a bridge, or separated by a canal bank, and fought the enemy with grenades. After the grenades were used up, they raised their bayonets and rushed up. The wounded comrades refused to leave the front line and demanded to continue fighting the enemy. The soldiers of the Seventh Company used such tenacious resistance and continuous heroic counter-attacks to kill and wound a large number of enemies and guarded their positions. Finally, when the signal flare of white light lit up in the sky, our army launched a full-scale counter-offensive against the enemy and drove the enemy back to their nest. On this day, the enemy organized four infantry divisions and more than a thousand cavalry, fighting for a whole day, attempting to break through and escape from Zhangjiakou, but as a result, they suffered heavy casualties and fled back in panic. On December 23rd, more than 70,000 enemies in Zhangjiakou were completely annihilated by our army.
    Compatriots! Comrades! I think it is very meaningful for us to recall the past history today. Our company, like other companies of the entire Chinese People's Liberation Army, has developed and grown stronger in the continuous battles against the enemy. As everyone knows, when we liberated Zhengding, our Seventh Company did not even have a single submachine gun for the assault troops to use to scale the city. But now, our equipment is completely different. Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly sent American weapons into our hands, making our equipment quite modern. Our tactics and techniques have also greatly improved. In the past, the American imperialists tried their best to support the Kuomintang reactionaries in fighting a civil war, trying to turn China into their colony, but with the efforts of our people across the country and the heroic battles of the People's Liberation Army, their illusions were completely shattered. Today, the American imperialists are again frantically sending troops to Korea, sending fleets to our Taiwan, and strengthening their aggression against the Philippines and Vietnam, but their dreams will also be completely shattered by the people of the East. The Korean people have already beaten the American aggressors very badly, and we Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and liberate all of China. I can now solemnly declare here on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of our entire company that we are always ready to accept the orders of the higher authorities to complete all sacred combat tasks. Now we are guarding the coastline of our motherland, and we are working hard to step up military training and study to better master advanced military science. We have the determination and sufficient strength to defend our hard-won victory and defend the peace of the East and the world.
    That's all I have to say.

　　我们有决心有力量保卫世界和平
    人民解放军华北军区某部大功第七连政治指导员  鄂继贤
    编者按：鄂继贤同志现任华北军区某部大功第七连政治指导员，七月三十一日他代表该连在中央人民广播电台向全国广播，庆祝中国人民解放军“八一”建军节。该连在一九四七年四月解放正定城全歼侯如墉匪部战斗中，集体建立大功。其后，在历次战斗中，均能勇敢地完成党给予的战斗任务，并在一九四八年七月徐水战斗和同年十二月张家口的北新渠包围阻击战斗中，创造了惊人的战绩。北新渠战斗曾荣获中央军委和兵团的嘉奖。本文即为鄂继贤同志在中央人民广播电台的广播词（本报曾略加删改）。
    亲爱的全国同胞们！同志们！今天是我们人民解放军建军二十三周年纪念日，我们全体同志都非常高兴，我们人民解放军在二十三年来经过了英勇艰苦的斗争，不断的发展壮大起来了，现在已经成为保卫我们祖国保卫世界和平的强大力量，今天中央人民广播电台约我来讲讲话，我想在今天来给大家谈一谈我们这个连在解放战争中的一些故事，也是很有意义的：
    一九四七年的四月间，人民解放军在河北省中部的正定县城进行了全部歼灭侯如墉匪部五千多人的战斗。在这一次攻坚战中，我们第七连完成了南城角的突击登城，打开突破口的任务，并且在巷战中缴获了大批武器，受到上级的嘉奖，全连记大功一次，获得了“正定登城首功连”的光荣称号，出现了第四、第七两个特功班，黄树田、王儒两个特等功臣和刘振江、辛英等大功功臣。
    四月九号开始战斗，很快的扫清了外围据点。我们在进入南关以后，连夜赶修工事，继续侦察地形和敌人的火力配备，选择好冲锋道路。一切准备好以后，担任架登城梯子的黄树田的第七班和担任爬城突击任务的王儒的第四班就召开了“诸葛亮会”，具体作了研究、拟订了战斗计划。
    四月十一号下午，太阳快落的时候，全面炮火开始向城上轰击了，火力压制得敌人不敢抬头，当两颗大炮弹炸毁了城楼上的碉堡以后，黄树田的第七班就抬起了五百多斤重的登城云梯，从距离城根有一百多公尺的冲锋出发地冲了出去，很快的冲到城根下，打上去四个手榴弹，靠上了云梯，敌人不断的往下扔手榴弹，但七班的同志们不顾一切，狠命的扶着梯子不放，这时候四班的刘振江同志就带领着他那个突击组首先冲了上去，还没有爬到梯顶，敌人就往外推梯子，梯子太重推不动，敌人就抓起几块大城砖狠命的砸下来，刘振江一个组全都负了伤，顺着梯子头上拉下来的绳子出溜下来。这时，突击队和梯子组一齐向城上打手榴弹，四班副王儒同志带领着第二突击组乘此机会很快的爬上城头。从总攻开始到登城共用了十五分钟的时间。但是当王儒刚刚爬上垛口时，四十个敌人就冲了上来，我们勇敢顽强的人民战士，举起手榴弹就向敌人投，紧接着端起刺刀瞪起两只眼一个人向四十多敌人冲去、杀退了敌人。后面部队连续不断的上去，向左右发展阵地，把城上的敌人打下城去，巩固和扩大了城上的突破口，并且在一个钟头内攻克了大小二十多个碉堡，占领了三百米长的阵地，炸开了南城门，给后续部队开辟了前进的道路，迅速解决战斗。
    我们完成了突击登城任务以后，全连又一致的向上级要求参加了巷战，我们发挥了勇敢机智的精神，用很少的一部分兵力解决了敌人一个团司令部，俘虏敌人二百多，缴获了大批武器弹药。
    从那以后，十四团七连，王儒、黄树田……这些响亮的名字，到处传播着。从那以后，七连随着华北大军向正太线，津南，保北，大清河北，察南，绥远，太原等地进军作战，完成上级所给的战斗任务，锻炼并壮大了我们自己而且在保北战役的四战徐水和平张战役的北辛渠阻击战中再次创造惊人的战绩。
    在一九四八年七月的徐水战斗中，七连没有担任突击任务，但当轰炸城的炸药一响，大家都高兴的不能抑制了，那时候黄树田同志已经升任七连副连长，他领着一个排就冲了上去，到城下靠好梯子就登城，有的嫌爬梯子太慢，就从轰塌了的城门楼子往上爬，眼看着敌人都往下跑掉了，黄树田同志和二班副雷达带着四班就冲进城去，这时候敌人还封锁着城坡，一班副韩德山就带着一个战斗小组，从城上的交通沟里跳出来，把枪一抱，顺着城坡也滚下来了，他们占领了一所院子以后，发现城墙坡的几个防空洞里还有敌人，黄树田马上命令四班去一个组爆破，那时候西北角上敌人两挺重机枪封锁着道路，但谁也顾不了这许多。黄树田自己也冲了上去，大家分头爬在几个洞口，喊着：“缴枪吧！缴枪不杀！要不缴出来手榴弹可扔进去啦，……”敌人不言语，还企图抵抗，四班的战士们就把大个的手榴弹扔进洞去，炸得敌人喊着叫着：“别打喽，缴枪喽，……”一个个的举起手来从洞里钻了出来。也就在这个时候，黄树田的头上被一颗重机枪子弹穿了一道深深的沟，血一道道的从脸上流下来，他没哼声，包扎好了，再继续指挥作战。在最后攻取西北角大堡垒的时候，他还亲手打了二十多发六○炮弹。在这次战斗中，七连俘虏了敌人二百八十多名。
    一九四八年秋天，我们随着大军进军绥远，解放了丰镇、包头等城市和广大乡村，当年十二月，部队接到了新的任务，参加平张战役，我们就从绥远前线很快的开到张家口地区，把张家口团团围困，不让敌人跑掉一个，待机一举歼灭，十二月九号，敌人集中了两个步兵师和将近一千人的骑兵，向张家口以南的宁远堡和清水河中间的阵地发动进攻，企图冲开个口子夺路逃走。
    我们七连正是担任着这一段防线的前卫。在八号的那一天，七连就整天和敌人撕杀着，最后打垮了敌人一个团的集团冲锋。九号早晨，敌人又集中了四个团的兵力向七连阵地疯狂的攻击。大家都抱着一颗坚决完成任务的决心，两只眼死盯着远处冲过来的敌人，敌人像是疯狗，又像是笨猪，一个个背着背包、皮靴，挎着干粮袋，提着枪弯着腰，向着七连阵地冲过来，我们的战士们谁也不动，直到敌人进到五、六十米远的时候，才一下子开始了排子枪的射击和排子手榴弹的轰炸，冲在前面的一群敌人被我们打垮以后，敌人就用炮火来报复，大量的炮弹打在我们阵地上，泥土埋在战士的身上，他们又从土里爬出来，继续战斗，敌人第二次，第三次……被督战队的冲锋枪逼着冲上来，又第二次、第三次……被我们打垮下去。
    这时候，八连的阵地被敌人冲破了，我们七连已经处在四面临敌的情况下，战士们就用手榴弹开出一条道路冲出包围，和营指挥所取得了联络，并且守卫在新的阵地上打击着敌人。后来特功连长黄树田同志举起了驳克枪喊着：“同志们上级号召坚守不丢掉一个阵地，坚决把敌人堵住，同志们跟我冲啊！”他带着队伍就冲了出去，董志鹏也端着他那机枪跟在黄连长后面，冲到了石桥前面，离敌人只有几十米了，就和敌人拚起手榴弹来，机枪打坏了，就拿步枪来打，手榴弹打光了，就从敌人的死尸上摘下手榴弹来，再向敌人打去，经过了激烈的战斗，终于把七连的阵地夺了回来，并且继续向着逃跑的敌人冲击。这时候黄树田同志已经三处负伤，尤其是臀部的伤口，使他不能够跑步，营团首长几次要他下去，但他坚决不下，还是咬着牙继续指挥全连作战。后来，我们全连在团部的统一指挥下，发动了三次全面的反冲锋，各班各排，甚至于临时组织起来的几个人，都自动的向敌人反扑，战士们有时候和敌人相隔几公尺，或是隔一座桥，或是隔一条渠堤和敌人拚手榴弹，拚完了手榴弹就端起刺刀来冲上去，负伤的同志不肯下火线要求继续和敌人搏斗。七连的战士们，就是用这样的顽强的阻击和连续不断的英勇的反冲锋，大量的杀伤了敌人，守卫着自己的阵地。最后当天空中亮起来了白光的讯号弹时，我军全线向敌人反攻，把敌人赶回到老窝里去。这一天敌人组织了这么四个步兵师和一千多骑兵，战斗了一整天，企图突围逃出张家口去，但结果遭到了很大的伤亡，狼狈逃回，十二月二十三号，张家口的七万多敌人被我军全部消灭了。
    同胞们！同志们！我觉得我们在今天来回忆一下过去的历史，确是很有意义的，我们的连队像整个中国人民解放军其他连队一样，在不断的对敌作战中发展壮大起来了，大家知道，当我们解放正定的时候，我们七连还是没有一支冲锋枪让突击登城部队使用的。而现在，我们的装备就完全不同了，蒋介石一次接一次的把美国武器送到我们手里来，使我们的装备相当的现代化了。我们的战术技术也大大的进步了，过去美帝国主义者竭力的支持国民党反动派打内战，想把中国变为他的殖民地，但在我们全国人民的努力和人民解放军的英勇战斗之下，完全粉碎了他的幻想。今天美帝国主义又来疯狂的出兵朝鲜，派舰队到我们的台湾，加强对菲律宾和越南的侵略，但是他们这种梦想也会被东方的人民完全粉碎的，朝鲜人民已经把美国侵略者打得非常狼狈了，我们中国人民也一定要解放台湾，解放全中国，我现在可以在这里代表我们全连的干部战士郑重地表示，我们随时都准备着接受上级的命令，去完成一切神圣的战斗任务。现在我们正守卫在我们祖国的海防线上，我们正在努力加紧练兵学习，更好的掌握先进的军事科学，我们有决心，也有足够的力量来保卫我们既得的胜利，保卫东方和世界的和平。
    我的话完了。
