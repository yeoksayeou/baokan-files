    Premier of the Republic, Grotewohl, continued to address the Congress with congratulatory remarks, stating: All German people must resist the war preparations underway in West Germany. Eliminating the danger of war is the primary task of all German patriots. The policy of the German Democratic Republic is based on friendship with all peace-loving nations, especially the Soviet Union. He concluded by calling on the Congress to give the warmongers the response they deserve.
    The Congress passed the following agenda: Pieck's report on striving for peace, unity, and economic progress, and Nuschke's report on the unified candidate list for the People's Election scheduled for October. The National Congress will also discuss the election program and elect the National Committee and the Presidium.
    During the proceedings, the Congress unanimously passed two resolutions: one protesting US interference in Korea and the other protesting West Germany's release of war criminals.
