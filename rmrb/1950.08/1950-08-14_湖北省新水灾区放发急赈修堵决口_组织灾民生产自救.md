　　湖北省新水灾区放发急赈修堵决口  组织灾民生产自救
    【新华社汉口十二日电】湖北省各地入夏后因雨水失调，遭受了新的洪水灾害，该省人民政府除拨粮进行救济外，并领导灾区人民与灾害进行搏斗。该省入夏以来，开头是天旱不雨，以后又逢大雨连绵，山洪暴发。结果江、汉洪水在部分堤段漫溢溃决。总计全省受水灾面积约二百万亩，灾民达一百五十万人。以孝感、沔阳两专区灾情最为严重。当水灾发生后，灾区人民在人民政府领导下，纷纷组织起来，进行生产自救。如汉川县重灾区人民组织起来到天门沉湖去捕鱼。该省人民政府并派民政厅黄宇斋厅长带领干部六十余名及医疗队二十五人组成慰问团，并携带救济粮五十万斤、救济款三千四百余万元，赶往汉川受灾地区，进行急救并帮助灾民组织生产。省人民政府又拨发五百万斤食粮，除急救断炊灾民外，并实行以工代赈，修堵决口，购买秋庄稼种籽，组织群众突击抢种秋庄稼。此外，该省又组织三个重灾区调查团，于本月二日分赴黄冈、孝感、荆州三个专区的重灾县作深入调查，以便研究生产救灾的具体办法。
