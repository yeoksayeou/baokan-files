　　Ningxia Jinji County Rectification Movement Examines Work on Unity with Ethnic Minorities
　　[By this newspaper] The Jinji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Ningxia Province, in its rectification movement, focused on examining the work of uniting with ethnic minorities. It was first discovered that the County Committee had not recognized that uniting with ethnic minorities is one of the important tasks of our party in leading the revolutionary movement. It did not recognize that in ethnic minority areas, abandoning unity with ethnic minorities means abandoning practical work. Therefore, it did not seriously educate all party members and cadres on uniting with ethnic minorities. As a result, cadres at all levels exhibited phenomena in their work that did not conform to the policy of uniting with ethnic minorities. Generally, cadres believed that uniting with ethnic minorities was "accommodating them" and "lowering the prestige of the government." Others still harbored remnants of "Great Han chauvinism," revealing a lack of perspective towards fraternal ethnic groups. On the other hand, there was insufficient cultivation and education of Hui cadres, leading some individual Hui cadres to make excessive demands on the masses in their work, seriously distancing themselves from the Hui masses. The County Committee believes that in the future, it is necessary to educate cadres to recognize the importance of uniting with ethnic minorities from an ideological and policy perspective, so as to resolutely implement the policy of uniting with ethnic minorities.

　　宁夏金积县整风运动中检查团结少数民族工作
    【本报讯】中共宁夏省金积县委，在整风中着重检查了团结少数民族工作。首先检查出在县委还没有认识到团结少数民族，是我党在领导革命运动中的重要工作之一。没有认识到在少数民族地区，离开团结少数民族，就是离开了实际工作。因此就没有在全体党员干部中认真进行团结少数民族的教育。以致各级干部在进行各种工作中发生了一些不符合团结少数民族政策的现象。一般干部对团结少数民族则认为“这是迁就了他们”、“这是降低了政府的威信”。另有些人还存在着“大汉族主义”的思想残余，暴露出缺乏兄弟民族观点。另一方面，表现了对回民干部培养教育不够，致个别回民干部在工作中，对群众要求过高，严重的脱离了回民群众。县委认为今后必须教育干部，从思想上、政策上去认识团结少数民族的重要性，从而坚决贯彻团结少数民族的政策。
