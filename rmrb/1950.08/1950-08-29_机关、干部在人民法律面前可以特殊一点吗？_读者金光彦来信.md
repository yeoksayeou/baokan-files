Can Institutions and Cadres Be Special Before the People's Law?
    Reader Jin Guangyan's Letter

Editor:
    I was originally an employee of the Beijing Vermicelli Factory of the Tianjin Jianzhong Enterprise Trading Company. When the company closed down in March of this year, I was left to handle the unfinished matters of the vermicelli factory and to take care of the factory buildings. At the end of March, because my housing (property of the Qingguan Bureau) was taken back, I moved to the vermicelli factory with the consent of Wang Zhengbo, the general manager of the company.

    On June 7th, the Beijing People's Court sent people to enforce a seizure because my company owed debt to the Jilin Provincial Department of Finance. The executor asked me to keep the factory building on behalf of the court.

    On July 25th, Comrade Yan Ti from the Jilin Provincial Department of Finance came to the factory and said that after the Beijing Municipal People's Court ruled that the factory building belonged to Jilin Province, it was sold to the Navy Headquarters. He asked me and another resident (also an employee of my company) to prepare to hand over the house. Because I had not yet received a notice from the court, I could not completely believe what Comrade Yan said.

    On the morning of July 27th, comrades from the local public security branch police station came to the factory to notify that the vermicelli factory was to be unsealed, but did not explain to whom my custodial responsibility should be handed over. At the same time, Comrade Yan Ti and several comrades from the Navy Headquarters also came to notify me that I should move out within three days. Because the three-day deadline was too short and it was not easy to find housing, and because the company's back wages had not yet been received, and I was in economic difficulty, I requested an extension of the removal deadline. However, Wang, the section chief of the Navy Headquarters, emphasized that the public urgently needed the house and refused my request. Finally, both parties agreed to let the court handle it.

    Yan Ti and I originally planned to go to the court together, but after I finished eating, Yan had left before me. In the afternoon, the court sent someone to my house to ask when I could move out, and I agreed that it would take at least ten days. However, because he had accepted the request from the Navy Headquarters, he only allowed me five days. I also planted vegetables, corn, etc. in the yard; I asked them to leave the crops after giving me a considerable price, but they did not consider it. Yan believed that these things should belong to the Navy Headquarters. After I explained that this was my own production in response to the government's call and did not belong to the company, Yan said, "We don't want these things, you can pull them out." He did not consider my loss.

    Later, the comrades from the court saw that I could not accept the five-day deadline, so they wanted to take me away. I asked them to show me the subpoena. The person from the court snorted and said to an executor, "Get him the subpoena!" But the subpoena sent to my hand was not my name, so I refused it immediately and asked to go to the police station to reason. It was not allowed. The subpoena was sent, one for me and the other for my wife, Wu Shuhui. That night, I went to the enforcement section of the court. They wanted me to resolve the matter with Comrade Yan the next morning.

    On July 28th, Yan and I went to Group C of the court's enforcement division, where Section Chief Li questioned us personally. He asked, "Why didn't you come when I subpoenaed you the day before?" I replied, "I came!" He asked again, "Why didn't you come when I first subpoenaed you?" I said, "No subpoena." He said, "Our court can send someone to go." I asked, "Should the court have a subpoena when it subpoenas someone? Although you had prepared a subpoena, it was not my name, so I did not go to the court." Section Chief Li then turned the conversation to the moving issue, asking why I was still asking for compensation for losses. I said, "Most of the vegetables, corn, etc. that I planted are not ripe and cannot be harvested. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask the harvester to pay the price. This is different from compensating for losses." Section Chief Li asked Yan, "Can you give money?" Yan said, "The headquarters does not have this fund!" At the same time, he believed that I was an employee of Jianzhong Company, and the production did not belong to me. Section Chief Li also agreed with his statement. I don't understand why the court did not first explain the reason for not paying the price, but first asked the Navy Headquarters if it could pay the price? Since they asked that way, it means that the matter depends on whether the other party pays or not.

    When we were arguing on this issue, Section Chief Li told me to go out first. When I came back, he announced the following rules to me: move out in five days, no bail required; move out in ten days, bail required. He asked me which one I chose. I chose the ten-day bail option. I finally moved out of the factory building on August 6th.

    Regarding the disposal of my produce, I was very angry at first and wanted to pull out all the crops when I moved. But after ten days of calm consideration, reason finally prevailed over emotion, and I decided to pick the mature and semi-mature corn, and leave the rest. But on the day I moved, some friends were indignant about this matter and trampled down more than a dozen pulled corn stalks. I stopped them from doing this venting behavior at that time.

    On August 8th, my guarantor received a subpoena from the court, asking him to go to the court the next day to talk. He asked me what it was about. I was also confused.

    On August 9th, we arrived at Group C of the Enforcement Section. Section Chief Li asked me why I pulled out all the immature corn stalks, and said that this was an act of destroying production. The person who accepted the house previously said to let me pull it out, but now he is accusing me of destroying production. I don't understand why.

    Editor, summarizing the above facts, I would like to ask you a question, please answer:
    In cases involving government agencies and ordinary people, from the perspective of the court, are government agencies superior to the people?
   Jin Guangyan

    Editor's Note: In the face of the laws of the People's Republic of China, government agencies have no special status. If all the statements in Jin Guangyan's letter are true, then the adjudicators of the Beijing People's Court were not fair enough in handling this case. It is right to set a deadline for the removal, but on the issue of the length of the deadline and on the issue of handling the crops planted by Jin Guangyan personally, the adjudicators of the court showed a one-sided consideration of the Navy Headquarters, which is wrong. Jin Guangyan's letter should arouse the vigilance of courts, institutions, and troops in various places. It is necessary to strictly abide by the procedures of the people's laws. Any acts of playing with the law and ideas of privilege are wrong. This is caused by the remaining influence of the bad style of the reactionary rule period, and it should be resolutely eliminated.

### 机关、干部在人民法律面前可以特殊一点吗？  读者金光彦来信

　　机关、干部在人民法律面前可以特殊一点吗？
    读者金光彦来信编辑同志：
    我原是天津市建中企业贸易公司北京粉丝厂的职员。今年三月该公司结束时，我被留下办理粉丝厂未了事宜，同时负责照管工厂房舍。三月末，我因住房（清管局房产）被收回，便征得公司总经理王正伯的同意，迁到粉丝厂居住。
    六月七日，北京市人民法院因我公司欠吉林省财政厅债务，派人前来执行查封。执行人要求我代法院保管厂房。
    七月二十五日，吉林省财政厅阎禔同志来厂，说京市人民法院将该厂房判归吉林省后，又转卖给海军司令部了。要求我和另一住户（亦系我公司职员）准备交房。我因尚未接到法院方面的通知，对于阎同志所说的话，还不能完全置信。
    七月二十七日上午，本段公安分局派出所同志来厂通知，要启封粉丝厂，但未说明我的保管责任应交给谁。同时，阎禔同志和海军司令部的几位同志也来通知我，要我在三日内迁出。我因三日期限太短，不易找到住房；又因公司欠薪还未领到，经济困难，要求延长迁出期限。但海军司令部的王科长光强调公家需房迫切，拒绝了我的要求。最后双方同意由法院处理。
    我和阎禔本来预定一同到法院去，但等我吃完饭后，阎已先我而去。午后法院派人到我家里，问我何时可以迁出，我答应至少需时十天。但他因已接受了海军司令部方面的要求，只允许我五天。院子里我还种着菜蔬、玉米等；我要求他们给以相当代价后把作物留下，但他们不予考虑。阎认为这些东西应归海军司令部所有。经我说明这是我响应政府号召自己生产的，并不属于公司，阎即说：“我们不要这些东西，你拔走吧。”他不考虑我的损失。
    后来法院同志见我不能接受五天的期限，便要把我带走。我要求他们拿出传票。法院的来人哼了一声，对一位执行员说：“拿传票给他！”但送到我手里的传票，不是我的名字，我当即拒绝了，并要求到派出所去理论。不允，传票送来了，一张是传我的，另一张是传我妻吴漱蕙的。当晚我便到法院执行科，他们要我在次日上午与阎同志共同解决。
    七月二十八日，我和阎到了法院执行庭丙组，由李科长亲自询问。他问：“头天传你为何不到？”我答：“到了！”又问：“先传怎不到？”我说：“无传票。”他说：“我们法院派人去就行。”我问：“法院传人，是否该有传票？你们虽曾准备了传票，但不是我的名字，所以我没到法院。”李科长又把话转到搬家问题上，问我为什么还要求赔偿损失。我说：“我种的蔬菜、玉米等，大部未成熟，不能收获。因此，要求收获者付出代价是合理的。这不同于赔偿损失。”李科长问阎：“你们可以给钱吗？”阎说：“司令部没有这笔经费！”同时认为：我是建中公司的职员，生产不属于我。李科长也同意他的说法。我不明白法院为何不先说明不付代价的理由，而要先问海军司令部是否可以付代价？既然这样问，那就是说事情决定于对方付不付。
    当我们在这一问题上争持不下的时候，李科长叫我先出去。等我回来时，他对我宣布如下的规定：五天搬家，不必取保；十天搬家须取保。问我选择那条。我选择了十天取保的一条。我终于在八月六日迁出了厂房。
    对于我的生产品的处置问题，最初我很气愤，想在搬家时把作物一齐拔掉。但经过十天的冷静考虑，理智终于战胜了情感，决定把成熟的和半成熟的棒子摘下，其余都留下了。但当我搬家的那天，有些朋友对此事抱不平，把拔过的棒子踏倒了十几棵。我当时就制止了他们这种泄愤的行为。
    八月八日，我的保人接到法院传票，叫他在次日到法院去谈话。他问我为什么事。我也莫明其妙。
    八月九日，我们到了执行科丙组。李科长问我为什么把不成熟的棒子都拔掉，并说这是破坏生产的行为。接受房屋者以前自己说是让我拔走，现在又来控诉我破坏生产，我不明白这是什么原因。
    编者同志，总结以上事实，我向你提出一个问题，请予解答：
    政府机关与一般人民涉讼，从法院的立场看来。政府机关是否要优于人民？
   金光彦
    编者按：在中华人民共和国的法律面前，政府机关没有任何特殊的地位。如果金光彦的来信所陈述的全系事实，则北京市人民法院的审判人员，对这件案子的处理是不够公正的。限期迁移是应该的，但在期限的长短问题上，在处理金光彦个人所种的作物问题上，该院审判人员都有偏面照顾海军司令部的表现，这是不应该的。金光彦的来信应该引起各地法院、机关、部队的警惕，要严格遵守人民法律的程序，任何玩法行为和特权思想，都是错误的。这是某些人受了反动统治时期的恶劣作风残余影响所造成的，应坚决加以肃清。
