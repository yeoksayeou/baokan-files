Good Movie Recommendations

    The Court of Honor

    "The Court of Honor" is a Soviet film with Mandarin dubbing, produced by the Soviet Film Export Factory in Moscow. It illustrates the role of Soviet scholars in enthusiastically defending their country's scientific creations and exposes how scholars in capitalist countries are like servants, listening to the dictates of their masters. These masters always seize the scientific inventions of others, attempting to use these inventions to oppose democratic countries. The film narrates the story of Soviet scholars Rossev and Professor Dobrotolsky, who created a great new invention – a special painkiller. Due to the political fragility of the elderly professor, this medicine was published in the American magazine "Life" before it was fully successful, attracting American spies to steal the manufacturing process. Fortunately, with the call to patriotic elements to fight them by Academician Verelesky, the professor's honor was restored at the Court of Honor.

    The Azure Road

    "The Azure Road," produced by the Soviet Kiev Art Film Studio in 1947 and dubbed into Mandarin by the Northeast Film Studio, depicts the story of a Soviet naval unit stationed in the port of Odessa after the victory of the Patriotic War, clearing the mines laid by the German invaders near Soviet ports along the Black Sea coast, in order to eliminate the threat to Soviet navigation after the war. Through the highly patriotic spirit and courageous and tenacious fighting will of Naval Major Third Rank Latonov, this dangerous and arduous task was finally completed. The above two films are scheduled to be released in the city starting from the tenth.

    荣誉审判会
    《荣誉审判会》是苏联影片输出厂在莫斯科翻译华语对白的苏联影片。它说明了苏联学者热烈捍卫本国科学创造的作用和揭露资本主义国家学者们如奴仆般听受他们主人支配的情形。他们这些主人总是攫取着别人的科学发明，企图利用这些发明去反对各民主国家。片中叙述苏联学者罗塞夫和教授多布特洛尔斯基创造了一种新的伟大发明——特殊止痛片，由于老诚的教授在政治上的脆弱，使这一药品在尚未完全成功之前在美国《生活》杂志上予以发表，并引来美国间谍窃取制造过程的行径。幸经科学院会员维列斯基号召爱国分子向他们作斗争，在荣誉审判会上挽回了教授的荣誉。
