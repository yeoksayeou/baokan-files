Xinhua News Agency, Success Lake Dispatch: Security Council President Malik issued a notice on the evening of the 28th to convene a regular meeting of the Security Council on the 29th, placing the issue of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China requesting the Security Council to sanction the U.S. government's armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan on the agenda of the Security Council meeting on the 29th.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 30th, TASS Dispatch: The provisional agenda for the Security Council meeting held on August 29th included the following two issues: (1) The Korean issue; (2) The protest of the Central People's Government of China against the U.S. armed aggression against Taiwan, thereby constituting aggression against China. The documents concerning the second issue include Zhou Enlai's telegram of August 24th and the letter from the U.S. representative to the United Nations on August 25th.

After Security Council President and Soviet Representative Malik read out the provisional agenda, U.S. Representative Austin requested to speak before the Security Council voted on the agenda. Austin claimed that because he reserved the right to object, he needed to make a brief statement. Referring to the original wording of the agenda, "Statement of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China regarding the U.S. government's armed aggression against Chinese territory and regarding violations of the United Nations Charter," Austin asked: Does Chairman Malik object to replacing it with the wording "Complaint concerning Taiwan"? Austin said: If Malik is willing to include it on the agenda in this way, the United States would be very happy to pass the agenda.

Chairman Malik then pointed out: The provisional agenda was drafted in accordance with the telegram from the People's Government of China. As for whether the Security Council should accept the issue according to the wording in the provisional agenda, or according to the alternative wording suggested by the U.S. representative, this should be decided by the Security Council. Malik concluded: The best way to resolve this issue is through a vote.

Nationalist representative Jiang Tingfu made a lengthy speech opposing the consideration of the complaint of the People's Government of China.

British Representative Jebb seconded Austin's proposal, agreeing to change the wording of the agenda.

Later, Malik spoke in his capacity as the Soviet representative. He pointed out: The People's Government of China directly accused the United States of armed aggression against Chinese territory and requested the Security Council to take measures to force the United States to withdraw its armed forces from Taiwan (which the United States still refers to as Formosa). Malik also stated that the United Nations Charter stipulates that members of the United Nations shall not threaten or use force against the political independence or territorial integrity of any country. The telegram from the People's Government of China pointed out that the U.S. dispatch of naval forces to occupy Taiwan violated this provision of the Charter. Therefore, Malik insisted that the Security Council must consider this complaint.

Malik continued: The wording of the agenda item is in accordance with the complaint of the People's Government of China. Malik pointed out: On August 25th, the Security Council accepted the U.S. proposal to begin discussing this issue. At that time, the U.S. representative read Austin's letter to the Security Council, and Zhou Enlai's telegram was read in the Security Council afterward. Malik stated: The U.S. argument that the Security Council should consider the "Formosa issue" is far off topic because the issue is U.S. armed aggression.

Malik pointed out: According to wartime and post-war decisions, Taiwan has been returned to China as an inseparable part of China, and this issue has been resolved as part of the war against German fascism and Japanese militarism.

Malik emphasized: The fact that the Security Council is now discussing is the aggression of foreign armed forces against this inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. Malik pointed out: The U.S. Seventh Fleet is blockading the island, isolating it from the only legitimate government of China. Malik reiterated: In this specific context, what is being complained about now is not the Formosa issue, but the armed aggression of the United States aimed at forcibly occupying the island. The United States wants to undermine the promises made at the Cairo Conference and invade Taiwan.

Malik concluded: In view of these facts, the Soviet delegation believes that this agenda item should be presented in accordance with the proposal of the People's Government of China.

Next, Indian Representative Rau spoke, saying: The Indian delegation supports the second item on the provisional agenda but believes that the wording of this agenda should be concise and should not contain any "prejudgments" on this issue. Rau suggested using the wording "Complaint of Armed Aggression against Formosa" to replace the wording in the provisional agenda.

U.S. Representative Austin accepted Rau's suggestion.

Before the vote, Chairman Malik asked: Is Rau willing to use the name Taiwan in the wording he suggested, or the name Formosa? Rau replied: The wording of the suggestion should be "Complaint of Armed Aggression against Taiwan (Formosa)."

Malik then announced that those who supported the Indian suggestion should vote. There were six votes in favor: Great Britain, the United States, India, Norway, France, and Ecuador.

The Chairman then announced that those who supported the original wording in the provisional agenda should vote. There was one vote in favor: the Soviet Union. Malik, in his capacity as the Soviet representative, explained that the Soviet delegation agreed with the wording in the provisional agenda. Thus, he announced that the agenda was passed with seven votes. The representatives of Cuba and the Nationalist Party voted against including this item on the agenda, and the representative of Egypt abstained. Yugoslavia did not participate in the vote.

Chairman Malik then announced: The Security Council has received Zhou Enlai's telegram regarding the U.S. aircraft attacking Chinese civilians within Chinese territory and the U.S. response to this complaint. Malik suggested that this complaint from the People's Government of China be placed on the agenda. British Representative Jebb opposed this, on the grounds that he had not yet seen the aforementioned documents. Malik then said: If the Security Council members have not read these documents and are therefore not prepared to express their opinions on this issue, then the suggestion to include the second Chinese complaint on the agenda can be postponed until the next meeting for a decision. The Security Council accepted Malik's decision.

Malik then spoke in his capacity as the Soviet representative, suggesting that the Security Council, as an exceptional measure, immediately approve inviting representatives of the People's Government of China to participate in the discussion when the Security Council discusses the agenda item "Complaint of Armed Aggression against Taiwan Island." Malik said that the Soviet suggestion was based on the provisions of the United Nations Charter, which require representatives of the People's Government of China to attend the meeting in the capacity of a party to the dispute. The Soviet suggestion was also based on the precedent of inviting both parties to the dispute to attend discussions when discussing issues such as Indonesia, Palestine, and Kashmir in the past. Malik pointed out: It would take at least three to five days for representatives of the People's Government of China to travel from Beijing to Success Lake.

U.S. Representative Austin objected, saying: The United States has not even considered the significance of this issue. Therefore, it cannot agree to make an exception to the Soviet suggestion. He said the suggestion was not yet mature.

Malik then explained in his capacity as Chairman that the Soviet suggestion to invite representatives of the People's Government of China now did not violate the rules of procedure. He said: Violating the principle of inviting both parties to the dispute to participate at the same time, as was currently violated in the Korean issue, was inexcusable.

Malik then asked the Security Council to vote on whether to support the Chairman's ruling. There were five votes against, namely: the United States, the Nationalist Party, Cuba, Norway, and Ecuador; two votes in favor, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia; and four abstentions, France, India, Great Britain, and Egypt. Malik declared: His ruling was effective because only five countries voted against it, and seven opposing votes were required to overturn the Chairman's ruling. He said: Based on this reason, the Soviet proposal should be put to a vote. Malik then read out the following: "Regarding the statement of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on the armed aggression against Taiwan (Formosa), the Security Council hereby decides to invite the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to send representatives attend the meetings of the Security Council."

British Representative Jebb expressed concern that the Soviet suggestion might be interpreted as inviting representatives of the People's Government of China to participate in all meetings of the Security Council. Malik explained that the limits of the invitation were clearly defined, but he said that if Jebb wished, he could propose a change. Jebb then proposed adding words to emphasize that the invitation only referred to the meeting discussing the Formosa issue.

Malik later announced that the Soviet delegation accepted this amendment.

U.S. Representative Austin then "warned" the members of the Security Council to beware of the dangers of so-called "hasty" actions, attempting to prevent the vote. Austin said that he would even vote against it without considering all the consequences of accepting this suggestion. Austin repeated the familiar cliché that the Security Council's efforts to invite representatives of South Korea to attend were "obstructed" by Malik's efforts to have representatives of North Korea and the People's Government of China attend. Austin asked: "Are we going to succumb now?"

Malik pointed out: This issue has already been decided, and the Chairman's ruling is valid. He said: The U.S. representative's rude violation of the rules of procedure and attempt to put pressure on the member states of the Security Council during the vote cannot but be surprising.

Malik continued: The U.S. representative has adopted a contradictory attitude. On the one hand, on the Korean issue, the U.S. representative insisted that North Korea was the "aggressor" and could not attend the Security Council meeting, while only the "victim" could attend. Now, on the Taiwan issue, the U.S. representative has made a 180-degree turn. The aggressor—the representative of the United States—is at this meeting. But the U.S. representative says: This issue must never be "prejudged," and the victim cannot attend; only the aggressor can attend.

Ecuadorian Representative Quevedo said: Ecuador is currently unable to accept the argument for inviting representatives of the People's Government of China. But he said: He did not want to prejudge the final opinion of the Ecuadorian delegation.

British Representative Jebb then said that the British delegation would abstain from the vote on the exceptional suggestion to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the Security Council meeting. Jebb claimed: It would be more appropriate to wait until the Security Council knew exactly when to discuss the Formosa issue before proceeding.

French Representative Chauvel also said that he would abstain at the moment and not prejudge the attitude the French delegation would take when the issue was raised according to normal rules.

Norwegian Representative Sunde requested that the full text of the proposal be read.

Then a vote was held, with four votes in favor (Soviet Union, Norway, India, and Yugoslavia), four votes against (United States, Cuba, Ecuador, and the Nationalist Party), and three abstentions (France, Egypt, and Great Britain).

Malik then announced that the proposal had not been passed. But the Soviet Union still reserved the right to propose inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China when conducting substantive discussions on the Taiwan issue.

The Security Council adjourned at this point and will reconvene on August 31st (Thursday).

### 安理会继续举行会议  我控美侵台案列入议程  马立克建议邀请我国派代表参加讨论

　　安理会继续举行会议
    我控美侵台案列入议程
    马立克建议邀请我国派代表参加讨论
    【新华社三十日讯】成功湖消息：安全理事会主席马立克，二十八日晚发出在二十九日召开安理会常会的通知，已将中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长要求安理会制裁美国政府武装侵略中国领土台湾的问题，列入安理会二十九日会议议程。
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社纽约三十日讯：八月二十九日举行的安理会会议临时议程，包括以下两个问题：（一）朝鲜问题；（二）中国中央人民政府抗议美国武装侵略台湾因而构成对中国的侵略问题。关于第二个问题的文件，计有周恩来八月二十四日的电报及美国驻联合国代表八月二十五日的函件。
    在安理会主席苏联代表马立克宣读临时议程以后，美国代表奥斯汀要求在安理会还未对议程进行投票表决以前发言。奥斯汀声称，由于他保留反对的权利，他需要作简略的声明。讲到议程的原文“中华人民共和国中央人民政府关于美国政府武装侵略中国领土，以及关于违反联合国宪章的声明”时，奥斯汀问道：马立克主席是否反对以“关于台湾的控诉案”的措辞替代。奥斯汀说：假若马立克愿意以这种提法列入议程，美国就很高兴通过这项议程。
    马立克主席接着指出：临时议程是依照中国人民政府来电而草拟的，至于安理会是否照临时议程中的提法受理这个问题，或另照美国代表所建议的其他提法受理，则应由安理会决定。马立克最后说：解决这一问题的最好办法，是投票表决。
    国民党代表蒋廷黻发表冗长的演说，反对考虑中国人民政府的控诉。
    英国代表杰伯附议奥斯汀的提案，赞成更改这项议程的提法。
    后来马立克以苏联代表资格发言，他指出：中国人民政府来电直接控诉美国武装侵略中国领土，并要求安全理事会采取措施使美国自台湾（美国仍称它为福摩萨（FORMOSA）撤退它的武装部队。马立克又称：联合国宪章规定联合国会员国不得以武力相威胁，并不得以武力侵犯任何国家的政治独立和领土完整。中国人民政府的电报指明美国派遣海军占领台湾，破坏了宪章的这一条款。因此，马立克力主安全理事会必须考虑这种控诉。
    马立克继称：议程项目的措词是按照中国人民政府的控诉的。马立克指出：在八月二十五日，安全理事会接受美国的提议，开始讨论这个问题，当时曾由美国代表向安理会宣读奥斯汀的函件，在这以后在安理会中宣读周恩来的来电。马立克称：美国所提的安全理事会应考虑“福摩萨问题”的论点，未免离题太远，因为问题是美国的武装侵略。
    马立克指出：按照战时和战后的决定，台湾已作为与中国不可分割的一部分归还中国，同时这个问题已作为对德国法西斯主义和日本军国主义的战争的一部分而得到解决。
    马立克强调称：安全理事会现在讨论的事实是外国武装部队侵略中华人民共和国的这个不可分割的部分。马立克指出：美国第七舰队封锁该岛，使它和中国唯一的合法政府隔绝。马立克重申：在这种具体情况下，现在控诉的不是福摩萨问题。而是美国旨在强占该岛的武装侵略问题。美国想要破坏在开罗会议上所作的诺言，并侵略台湾。
    马立克最后说：鉴于这些事实，苏联代表团认为这一项议程，应按照中国人民政府的提法提出。
    接着是印度代表劳氏发言，他说：印度代表团赞成临时议程的第二项，但是认为这项议程的措辞应当简短扼要，并且不应该含有对这个问题的“预先判断”。劳氏建议用“控诉武装侵略福摩萨”这种措词来代替临时议程中的措辞。
    美国代表奥斯汀接受了劳氏的建议。
    在表决之前，主席马立克问道：劳氏是愿意在他所建议的措词中用台湾这个名字呢，还是用福摩萨这个名字呢？劳氏回答说：这个建议的措词应该是“控诉武装侵略台湾（福摩萨）案”。
    马立克随即宣布赞成印度建议的人投票。赞成的有六票——英国、美国、印度、挪威、法国和厄瓜多尔。
    主席然后宣布赞成临时议程中原措辞的国家投票。赞成的有一票——苏联。马立克以苏联代表的资格解释说：苏联代表团赞同临时议程中的提法。于是，他宣布这项议程以七票通过。古巴代表和国民党代表投票反对将这一项目列入议程，埃及代表弃权。南斯拉夫未参加投票。
    马立克主席然后宣布：安理会收到周恩来关于美国飞机在中国境内袭击中国平民的电报和美国答复这一控诉的函件。马立克建议将中国人民政府这次控诉列入议程。英国代表杰伯反对这样做，理由是他还没有看到上述文件。马立克于是说：如果安理会理事还没有阅读到这些文件，因而没有准备好就这个问题发表意见的话，那么把中国第二个控诉列入议程的建议可以延迟到下次会议决定。安理会接受了马立克这个决定。
    马立克然后以苏联代表的资格发言，建议安理会作为一项例外的措施，立即批准在安理会将来讨论“控诉武装侵略台湾岛案”一项议程时，邀请中国人民政府派代表参加讨论。马立克说，苏联这一建议是以联合国宪章的条款为根据的，宪章的条款要求中国人民政府的代表以争端当事人的资格出席会议。苏联这一建议也是根据以前讨论印尼、巴勒斯坦、克什米尔等问题时邀请争端双方出席讨论的先例而提出的。马立克指出：中国人民政府代表由北京到成功湖至少需要三天至五天的时间。
    美国代表奥斯汀提出反对，他说：美国根本尚未考虑这个问题的意义。因此就不能同意就苏联的建议作例外处理。他说这个建议尚未成熟。
    马立克随即以主席身份解释说：苏联建议现在邀请中国人民政府代表参加，并未违反程序规则。他说：违反邀请争端双方同时参加的原则如目前在朝鲜问题上违反了这个原则那样是无可原谅的。
    马立克随即请安理会表决是否支持主席的裁决。投票反对者有五票，即：美国、国民党、古巴、挪威及厄瓜多尔；赞成者二票，苏联与南斯拉夫；弃权者四票，法国、印度、英国及埃及。马立克宣称：他的裁决生效，因为只有五国投反对票，而要推翻主席的裁决须有七张反对票。他说：基于这个理由，应将苏联建议案提付表决。马立克随即宣读如下：“为中华人民共和国中央人民政府就武装侵略台湾（福摩萨）的声明事，安理会兹决定邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府派遣代表出席安全理事会的会议。”
    英国代表杰伯表示担心苏联的建议可能被解释为邀请中国人民政府代表参加安理会的一切会议。马立克解释道：邀请的限度已有明确规定，但他说如果杰伯愿意的话，他可以提出更改。杰伯于是提议再添加词句，以着重说明这个邀请仅指出讨论福摩萨问题的会议。
    马立克后来宣布：苏联代表团接受这个修正。
    美国代表奥斯汀于是“警告”安理会各理事提防所谓“仓猝”从事的危险，企图借此阻止表决。奥斯汀说，他将甚至不考虑接受这一建议的全部后果如何而投票反对。奥斯汀再次重复那种听惯了的滥调，说安理会请南朝鲜代表列席的努力，因马立克努力想要使北朝鲜和中国人民政府代表列席而受到“阻挠”。奥斯汀问道：“难道我们现在要屈服吗？”
    马立克指出：这个问题业已作出决定，主席的裁决有效。他说：美国代表粗暴地违反程序规则，企图在表决时对安理会理事国使用压力，这种行径不能不使人惊讶。
    马立克接着说：美国代表采取了自相矛盾的态度。一方面，在朝鲜问题上，美国代表坚持北朝鲜是“侵略者”，不能出席安理会的会议，而只有“受害者”才能出席。现在，在台湾问题上，美国代表却来了个一百八十度的转向。侵略者——美国的代表就在这会议上。但是美国代表说：这个问题决不能“预为判断”，受害者不能出席，只有侵略者才能出席。
    厄瓜多尔代表奎维铎说：厄瓜多尔目前是不能接受邀中国人民政府代表的论据。但是他说：他并不想预先断定厄瓜多尔代表团最后的意见。
    英国代表杰伯接着说：英国代表团在表决邀请中华人民共和国代表参加安理会的例外建议时将弃权，杰伯声称：在安理会确切知道何时讨论福摩萨问题之前先行等待，是比较合宜的。
    法国代表萧维尔也说，目前他将弃权，而不预先断定在问题按正常规则提出时法国代表团将采取的态度。
    挪威代表森德要求宣读提案全文。
    接着即举行表决，四票赞成（苏联、挪威、印度和南斯拉夫），四票反对（美国、古巴、厄瓜多尔和国民党），三票弃权（法国、埃及和英国）。
    于是马立克宣布提案未获通过。但苏联仍保留在进行讨论台湾问题的实质问题时提出邀请中华人民共和国代表的提议的权利。
    安理会至此宣告休会，并将于八月三十一日（星期四）复会。
