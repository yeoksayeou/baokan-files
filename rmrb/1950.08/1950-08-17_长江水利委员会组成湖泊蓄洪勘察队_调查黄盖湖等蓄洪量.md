Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 15th – The Lake Flood Storage Survey Team recently organized by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission departed on the 5th of this month. The team plans to conduct a preliminary survey of six lakes in Hubei Province along the Yangtze River, from below Dongting Lake to Huanggang County, including Huanggao Lake, Zhangdu Lake, Wu Lake, Baishui Lake, Dong Lake, and Xi Lake. The main purpose of the survey is to understand the lake boundaries during flood periods, lake waterways and drainage conditions of the above lakes, and to investigate historical hydrological data and the distribution of residents within the lake boundaries, land issues, etc.; to estimate the capacity of flood storage, in order to organize it and use it for flood storage, and to reduce the flood disasters in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. After completing the above survey, the team will formulate a preliminary consolidation plan, organize an engineering office, and prepare to conduct low-water surveys, measurements, and designs of the above lakes after this year's autumn flood. They aim to complete all the earthwork for the above lake consolidation projects before next year's summer flood, so that the above lakes can be used for planned flood storage when the Yangtze River rises during next year's summer flood season.
