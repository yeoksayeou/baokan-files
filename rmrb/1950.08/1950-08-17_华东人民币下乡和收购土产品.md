　　The Circulation of Renminbi in Rural East China and the Purchase of Local Products
　　By Our Special Correspondent Lin Wei
　　Renminbi Enters the Countryside
　　The circulation of Renminbi in the countryside is an important step in expanding the scope of currency circulation and further consolidating the value of the currency. From the perspective of adjusting industry and commerce, it also means the expansion of raw material markets and sales markets, obtaining export goods, and in turn, exchanging them for foreign exchange to purchase industrial raw materials and machinery that are lacking domestically. East China proposed the issue of Renminbi entering the countryside as early as last autumn, but due to price fluctuations and unstable currency values at the time, achievements were limited. In addition, transportation had not yet returned to normal, and trading agencies did not have a large amount of materials to supply, making it even more difficult for currency to enter the countryside. After March of this year, with the unification of national finance and economy and the initial stabilization of currency values, the conditions for Renminbi to enter the countryside began to be available, and the situation became very different. After the vigorous adjustment of industry and commerce was proposed in early May, the East China Military and Political Committee subsequently issued instructions in late May on organizing the circulation of Renminbi in the countryside, requiring state-owned banks, trading agencies, and cooperatives to cooperate and jointly promote this work. Over the past few months, this work has achieved great development. As of late June, the East China trade sector alone had invested approximately 500 billion Renminbi in rural areas to purchase tea and silk cocoons. Among them, farmers in the triangular area of ​​Shaoxing, Hangzhou, and Huzhou in Zhejiang Province earned 200 billion yuan from selling cocoons. Compared with the end of May and the end of February, the population using Renminbi in the Southern Jiangsu area increased from 36% to 79% of the total population, the Northern Jiangsu area increased from 26% to 61%, Southern Anhui increased from 28% to 83%, and the rural suburbs of Nanjing increased from 77% to 99%. Although there are no statistics for other regions, the population using Renminbi is increasing. It is not uncommon to store Renminbi for a month and a half. Barter trade, and the dominance of silver dollars, Hong Kong dollars, and US dollars, has been greatly reduced. Even in Xiamen, where the vast majority of people used US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, and silver dollars, 70% of the population is now using Renminbi.
　　Uniting Private Merchants and the Price Issue
　　The main bridge for promoting the circulation of Renminbi in the countryside is the purchase of local agricultural products. During this period, the purchase was mainly carried out by state-owned trading agencies to promote exports and take care of the interests of farmers. The main materials purchased were silk cocoons and tea. However, due to the limited capital and manpower of the state, and the even more limited strength of cooperatives, many remote areas and mountainous areas were not reached. The types and quantities of purchases are also limited. Therefore, it has not yet been possible to "make the best use of everything and ensure the smooth flow of goods." Even in terms of the large-scale purchases of tea and silk cocoons, not all have been purchased. Therefore, uniting private merchants to participate in the purchase work and bring industrial products to the countryside is one of the tasks that the East China trade authorities urgently need to develop. This is not only a matter of the interests of the vast number of farmers and the state, but also a way out for private industry and commerce. According to the materials from individual regions in May and June, the role of private merchants in this work cannot be ignored. In Quzhou, Zhejiang, private merchants from Shanghai, Hangzhou and Guangdong invested nearly 500 billion Renminbi in the purchase of tea, asphalt, screen paper, wood, and white charcoal. Before these products were purchased in April, their selling prices mostly fell below cost, but they have now begun to improve.
　　In uniting private merchants to participate in this work, in addition to providing certain conveniences in terms of travel, taxation, and transportation procedures (some problems still remain unresolved), the most important issue is the purchase price. Private merchants, for their own benefit, always want to lower prices as much as possible to exploit farmers, which is not terrible. As long as the state also purchases at the same time, without adopting the method of separate purchase by public and private sectors advocated by some private merchants, prices will not be too low. The current problem is that trading agencies in some regions, simply in order to complete tasks, or unilaterally emphasizing the interests of farmers, have raised prices too high, and private merchants are unwilling to lose money and cannot participate in the purchase. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct investigations and research to set a reasonable purchase price. When the trading agency in Lu'an County, Northern Anhui, purchased tea, the purchase price was initially higher than the selling price in Bengbu, which was unreasonable. Later, due to capital constraints, the purchase was suspended after only a portion had been completed. As a result, the ratio of tea to rice plummeted from 1:8 to 1:2, which dealt a great blow to tea farmers. Later, the price was reasonably adjusted, giving private merchants appropriate profits, and private merchants purchased more than 700,000 catties at this price, benefiting both farmers and merchants.
　　If the trading agency lacks planning and steps in the purchase, and the various units do not cooperate well, blindly and independently raising prices to purchase will not only prevent private merchants from participating, but will also hinder the completion of their own tasks. In Xuancheng, Southern Anhui, in the purchase of rapeseed in a certain town, the price initially started at 80,000 yuan per dan (130 catties), and then soared to 175,000 yuan. As a result, it affected market psychology, and sellers expected prices to rise and were unwilling to sell, making it impossible to complete the purchase task in a timely manner. This is detrimental to both the public and private sectors.
　　Still Needs to Be Further Developed
　　While purchasing local products, it is also necessary to supply farmers with the daily necessities they need, so that farmers will not have difficulty buying production and living materials after receiving Renminbi. Although a lot of supply work has been done in the past period, in order to more universally and deeply promote the work of Renminbi entering the countryside, it is still necessary to establish as many branches of trade and banks as possible, so that the products of remote areas can also be exchanged with cities, and it is convenient for the majority of farmers to sell, buy, save and remit money. This time, banking institutions in Linghu and other places in Zhejiang Province carried out publicity and business activities related to principal-protected and value-guaranteed deposits and fixed and current deposits along with the purchase work, which was enthusiastically welcomed by farmers. It should be promoted and strengthened in the future. Before banks and trade departments have time to widely establish branches, it is necessary to vigorously develop and consolidate cooperatives and gradually establish credit departments in cooperatives (at present, the number of cooperatives in rural areas in East China, especially in the new areas, is still insufficient, and credit departments are even fewer).
　　For poor villages and disaster areas (such as many counties in Northern Anhui) with few specialties and local products, due to the lack of purchasable goods, there is very little Renminbi circulation, and silver dollars or barter trade are mostly used. Banks and trade departments should consider promoting the use of Renminbi in other appropriate ways.
　　For such areas and even general areas, the publicity work on Renminbi and price trends is still important. At present, the general public has begun to trust Renminbi, but this trust is not yet solid. Many farmers and small vendors in townships still believe in the price rules under hyperinflation in the past ten years. According to the survey materials of a certain town in Northern Jiangsu: now when buying on credit, Renminbi is used for records within ten days or half a month, and physical objects are still used for records for more than one or two months. It is also not common to be willing to save Renminbi for a long time. In the mountainous areas of Central and Southern Zhejiang and Southwestern Fujian, there are still bandits causing trouble, and social order has not yet been completely stabilized. In some areas, there are also special agent saboteurs spreading rumors to undermine the credibility of Renminbi. Therefore, we not only need to show farmers the facts, but also need to carry out publicity and interpretation work at any time and any place to consolidate the people's prestige of their own currency and be happy to use and store Renminbi. Consolidate the people's prestige of their own currency and be happy to use and store Renminbi.

　　华东人民币下乡和收购土产品
    本报特派记者  林韦
    人民币下乡
    人民币下乡，是扩大货币流通面和更进一步巩固币值的重要步骤。从调整工商业说，它更意味着原料市场与销售市场的扩展，取得出口物资，进而换得外汇，购买国内缺乏的工业原料与机器。华东在去年秋季就提出人民币下乡问题，但因当时物价波动，币值不稳，成就不大。加以当时交通未恢复正常，贸易机关也没多量物资可以供应，货币下乡因而更难。今年三月份以后，国家财经统一，币值初步稳定，国家贸易机关掌握的物资渐趋充足，人民币下乡的条件开始具备，情形就大不相同了。五月初提出大力调整工商业以后，华东军政委员会随着在五月下旬发出关于组织人民币下乡的指示，要求国家银行、贸易机关、合作社配合一致，共同推进这一工作。几个月来，这一工作获得极大发展。截止六月下旬，光华东贸易部门在乡间收购茶、茧，即投下人民币五千亿元左右。其中浙江的绍兴、杭州、湖州间三角地带二十来县，农民卖茧所得达二千亿元。以五月底与二月底相较，苏南区使用人民币的人口由全人口的百分之三六增至七九，苏北区由百分之二六增至六一，皖南由百分之二八增至八三，南京市郊农村由百分之七七增至九九。其他地区虽无统计，但使用人民币的人口都在增加。储藏人民币一月半月的事，已不鲜见。物物交易，银元与港币、美钞的阵地，已大大缩小。连厦门那样绝大部分使用美钞、港币与银元的地区，现在也有百分之七十的人口在使用人民币了。
    团结私商与价格问题
    推行人民币下乡的主要桥梁，是收购农村土产品。在这一时期的收购，主要是国家贸易机关为推进出口、照顾农民利益而收购，收购的主要物资是茧与茶。但因国家的资力、人力有限，合作社的力量更有限，所以有许多偏僻地区和山地没有达到。收购的种类与数量也有限。因此尚未做到“物尽其用，货畅其流”。即就大宗收购的茶、茧说，也还没有全部收购。因此，团结私商来参加收购工作，并将工业品带到乡间去，是目前华东贸易机关极待开展的工作之一。这不仅是广大农民与国家的利害问题，也是私营工商业的出路问题。根据五、六月份个别地区的材料，私商在这一工作中的作用是不能忽视的。在浙江衢州一地收购茶叶、柏油、屏纸、木材、白炭中，沪帮、杭帮与广东帮的私商投入人民币近五亿元。上述产品在四月份未收购前，售价多跌至成本以下，现已开始好转。
    在团结私商参加这一工作中，除了行旅、税收与运输手续上需要给以若干便利（现在仍有若干问题未解决）外，最重要的是收购价格问题。私商为了自己利益，总想尽量压低价格来剥削农民，这并不可怕。只要国家也同时收购，不采取某些私商所主张的公私双方分类分区收购办法，价格是不会压得太低的。现在的问题是若干地区的贸易机关单纯为了完成任务，或片面强调农民利益，把价格提得太高，私商不愿赔钱，无法参加收购。所以经过调查研究，订定一个合理的收购价，是必要的。贸易机关在皖北六安县收茶时，收价一开始就高于销地蚌埠，这是不合理的。后因资力限制，收购一部便中止了。结果茶与米的比价由一比八剧降为一比二，给茶农以很大打击。后来把价格加以合理调整，给私商以适当利润，私商以此价格收购七十多万斤，农、商双方都得了利益。
    贸易机关在收购中如果缺乏计划与步骤，各单位配合不好，各自盲目的单独提价购买，不仅使私商不能参加，对自己本身任务的完成也有妨碍。在皖南宣城某镇收购菜籽中，开始为每担（一百三十斤）八万元，后猛涨至十七万五千元。结果影响了市场心理，售者看涨，不肯出手，使收购任务不能及时完成。这是公私两不利的。
    还须继续深入开展
    在收购土产品的同时，还须供应农民所需的日用品，使农民在得到人民币以后，不致发生买不到生产资料和生活资料的困难。过去一个时期中，虽则已经作了许多供应工作，但为着更普遍、更深入地开展人民币下乡的工作，还需要尽可能地更多的增设贸易与银行的分支机构，使穷乡僻壤的产品也能与城市交流，使大多数农民卖出买进与存汇都很方便。这次浙江菱湖等地的银行机关随着收购工作进行关于保本保值存款与定活两便存款的宣传与业务活动，即得到农民热烈欢迎。以后还应推广与加强。在银行与贸易部门还来不及普设分支机构之前，大力发展与整理合作社，逐步建立合作社的信用部，是必要的（现在华东农村尤其是新区，合作社的数量还不够，信用部更少）。
    对于特产与土产不多的穷乡与灾荒区域（如皖北很多县份），因无可收购，人民币下乡也极少，多半在使用银元或以物易物。银行与贸易部门应考虑以其他适当方式推广人民币的使用范围。
    对这种地区以至一般地区，人民币和物价形势的宣传工作都还是重要的。现在一般群众对人民币是开始有了信任，但这种信任还不巩固。有许多乡镇上的农民与小商贩还在相信过去十多年通货膨胀下的物价规律。据苏北某镇调查材料：现在赊账时十天半月以内记人民币，一两个月以上的仍然记实物。愿意长期储蓄人民币的也还不普遍。在浙江中南与福建西南山地，都还有土匪在扰乱，社会秩序还未完全稳定，有的地区还有特务破坏分子在造谣破坏人民币的信用。因此，我们不仅需要拿事实给农民看，还需要随时随地进行宣传解释工作，以巩固人民对自己货币的威信，乐于使用和储藏人民币。固人民对自己货币的威信，乐于使用和储藏人民币。
