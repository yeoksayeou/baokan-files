　　Northwest Education Conference Held
    Correcting Deviations in Education Reform
    [This newspaper's dispatch] From the "Xi'an Masses Daily": The Northwest Region recently convened its first education conference. Seventy-seven people attended, including heads of educational administrative departments above the special commissioner level from all five provinces and one city in the Northwest, representatives from some secondary schools, and heads of important cultural centers in various cities. The conference reviewed the main achievements and shortcomings in education work over the past year. Through discussion, unanimous understanding was reached on major issues in reforming secondary education and carrying out worker-peasant education.

    First, regarding the political and ideological education of teachers and students, the conference considered that achievements had generally been made, but individual schools had adopted hasty measures that disregarded procedures, methods, and the level of awareness of teachers and students. Some schools conducted "comprehensive ideological examinations" of students, raising questions about trivial details of their lives. Some schools launched "three evaluations campaigns," attempting to correct students' erroneous thinking through short-term shock tactics. In some areas, methods such as struggle and confession were used in teacher learning sessions to "eliminate" teachers' old viewpoints and styles. These practices increased many unnecessary concerns in teachers and students, hindering their progress. At this education conference, everyone recognized that ideological transformation is a complex, meticulous, and long-term educational process that must be guided by the situation, step by step, patiently and persuasively, on the basis of self-awareness, and appropriate criticism and self-criticism must be conducted to achieve the goal. Any crude or overly hasty approach is wrong. The requirements for ordinary schools must be distinguished from the requirements for cadre schools.

    Second, on the issue of school reform, due to a lack of concrete guidance from the leading organs and an unstable grasp of the new democratic education policy by some education workers, two deviations emerged: being overly hasty and delaying the implementation of reforms. The former was seen in some minority areas, where religious classes were abolished too hastily, regardless of the level of mass awareness. Excessive demands were made on private schools, and insufficient assistance was provided, leading to the misconception that the government was restricting the development of private schools. The latter was reflected in some schools that adhered to the old school rules and regulations and did not actively carry out reforms.

    Third, in terms of teaching, due to a lack of experience with the new education among many teachers, there were shortcomings of blindness and dogmatism in teaching. The main issue was a disregard for students' ability to learn and a lack of attention to teaching effectiveness, resulting in subjective indoctrination that students could not digest. The main way to overcome this shortcoming is to strengthen teachers' professional development, focusing on teaching methods closely integrated with practice, and appropriately streamlining teaching materials, strengthening guidance for students' extracurricular assignments and self-study, and promoting the spirit of teachers being fully responsible for students.

    The conference also discussed the issue of worker-peasant education, clearly recognizing its great significance. The attending representatives exchanged preliminary views on the main points of the Northwest District Education Department's work plan for the second half of the year, on the issue of relieving out-of-school students and unemployed teachers, on how to carry out social education work in pastoral areas, and on the issues of adding worker-peasant rapid middle schools and carrying out literacy campaigns next year. At the closing ceremony held on the 3rd of this month, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and Jiang Longji, Minister of Education, both attended and spoke.

### 西北召开教育会议  纠正教育改革工作偏向

　　西北召开教育会议
    纠正教育改革工作偏向
    【本报讯】西安群众日报消息：西北区最近召开了第一次教育会议。到会的有全西北五省一市专署以上教育行政部门、部分中等学校及各重要城市文化馆的负责人共七十七人。会上检查了一年来教育工作中的主要成绩和缺点；经过讨论，对改革中等教育，开展工农教育等工作中的主要问题取得了一致的认识。
    首先，在教师与学生的政治、思想教育方面，会议认为一般是有成绩的，但个别学校采取了不讲步骤、不讲方式、不顾教师及学生的觉悟程度的急躁措施。有的学校对学生进行“全面的思想检查”，提出一些生活细节上的问题去追问。有的学校发动“三评运动”，企图用短期突击的方式去纠正学生的错误思想。有的地区在教师学习会里用斗争、坦白等方式去“清除”教师的旧观点、旧作风。这些，都使教师学生在思想上增加了许多不必要的顾虑，反而妨碍了他们的进步。在这次教育会议上大家认识了思想改造是一个复杂细致、长期教育的过程，必须在其自觉的基础上，因势利导，循循善诱，进行适当的批评与自我批评，才能达到目的。企图用任何粗暴的、过急的方式都是错误的。必须把对普通学校的要求和对干部学校的要求，区别开来。
    其次，在学校改革问题上，由于领导机关缺乏具体指导，部分教育工作者对新民主主义的教育方针和政策掌握不稳，因而产生了操之过急和拖延不进行改革的两种偏向。前者如某些少数民族地区，不顾群众觉悟程度，过急地取消宗教课；对私立学校要求过高，帮助不够，以致引起某些人的错觉，认为政府限制私立学校的发展。后者表现在一部分学校墨守旧学校成规，不去主动地进行改革。
    第三，在教学工作方面，由于许多教师对新教育缺乏经验，教学上存在着盲目性和教条主义的缺点。主要的是不顾学生的接受能力，不注意教学效果，只是主观的灌输，使学生对所学课程消化不了。克服这种缺点的主要办法是加强教师的业务学习，着重与实际密切结合的教学方法，并适当地精简教材，加强对学生课外作业和自习的领导，发扬教师对学生全面负责的精神。
    会议又讨论了工农教育问题，明确认识了工农教育的重大意义。到会代表对西北区教育部今年下半年工作计划要点，对救济失学学生与失业教师问题，如何开展游牧区社教工作以及明年添设工农速成中学和开展识字运动等问题，都交换了初步意见。在本月三日举行闭幕式时，西北军政委员会习仲勋副主席和教育部江隆基部长均曾到会讲话。
