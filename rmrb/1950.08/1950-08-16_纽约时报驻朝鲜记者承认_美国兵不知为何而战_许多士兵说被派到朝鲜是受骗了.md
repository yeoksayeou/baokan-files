　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th. New York dispatch: New York Times correspondent in Korea, Jonesdon, admitted in his paper on the 14th: "The average American soldier in Korea does not seem to know why he is fighting in Korea," which "leads American soldiers to the conclusion that others have thrown him into a chaos he does not understand." At the same time, many soldiers said they were tricked into being sent to fight in Korea. Jonesdon reported what a young infantryman said when he was being sent to a certain war zone in Korea: "The recruitment advertisements did not mention fighting in Korea."
　　Jonesdon dared not write about the growing dissatisfaction among American soldiers who were being fooled by American imperialism, but he said that one could hear indirect rebukes of the American aggression from the mouths of American soldiers. Jonesdon quoted a 19-year-old corporal as saying: "I keep asking myself, what am I doing here? But I can't find an answer."
　　Jonesdon admitted: "The lack of psychological preparation for the cruelty and danger of armed combat has become one of the greatest weaknesses among the average American soldiers fighting in Korea." He said that the average American soldier "does not seem to know why, as a 'United Nations' soldier, he only has South Koreans with him on the front line. He is obviously wondering why he was transferred so hastily from the comfort of garrison duty to the smoky and constantly vigilant battlefield."

　　纽约时报驻朝鲜记者承认
    美国兵不知为何而战
    许多士兵说被派到朝鲜是受骗了
    【新华社十五日讯】纽约讯：纽约时报驻朝鲜记者琼斯敦十四日在其论文中承认：“在朝鲜的一般美国士兵，似乎并不晓得他为何在朝鲜作战”，这“就使得美国士兵的心中得到这样一个结论：别人把他投入他并不了解的混乱里”。同时许多士兵们说：他们被派到朝鲜作战是受骗了。琼斯敦报道一位年青的步兵在开到朝鲜某战区时所说的话称：“招募士兵的广告，并没有提到来朝鲜作战。”
    琼斯敦不敢写出受美帝国主义愚弄的美国士兵中逐渐产生的不满情绪，但是他说：从美国兵士的口中可以听到间接斥责美国侵略的谈话。琼斯敦引一个十九岁的下士的话说：“我不断问我自己，我在这里干什么？但是找不到答案来。
    琼斯敦承认：“对于武装战斗的残酷性和危险性缺少心理上的准备，已经成为在朝鲜作战的一般美国士兵当中最大弱点之一。”他说：一般美国兵“似乎也不知道，作为一个‘联合国’士兵，他在战线上为什么只有南朝鲜人和他在一起。他显然在怀疑，他为什么要从卫戍勤务的舒适生活中，非常仓促地被调到乌烟瘴气与时时提防的战场上来”。
