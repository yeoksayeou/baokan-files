Editor's Note: We constantly receive letters and articles from readers criticizing the work and work style of the People's Courts. Many readers even travel long distances to offer their opinions. Some of these cases may not be the focus of the current People's Courts in handling cases, but they are very closely related to the people's lives. We are publishing some of the readers' opinions here, hoping that courts in various regions will pay attention to inspecting them.

Three Cases in Xinle County

Comrades Editors:

The Xinle County People's Court has many bureaucratic errors in handling cases, which the masses are very dissatisfied with. Now I will tell you a few examples.

(1) Zhang Luoli, a villager from Mucun Village in the Second District of Xinle, had a dispute with Zhang Lanchen's mother over a former thatched shed, which led to a fight. Lanchen's mother sued to the district, but it was not properly resolved, so she sued to the county. After the county court summoned the defendant Zhang Luoli, the clerk Ren Ruiying detained the defendant without asking for a reason (Why does the clerk have such great power? - Editor). On the same day, Zhou Luozhan from the village came to inquire, and Ren Ruiying said: "Luoli has already run back." and asked the plaintiff to take a message back to find him. Luoli's son, Zhang Jinmao, and the village chief, Tian Rongsuo, went to the county to inquire. Ren Ruiying said: "It's clear that the person has already run back, and you're still asking for him here, you must be messing around." Zhang Jinmao thought that his father had either committed suicide or been harmed by someone, so he immediately found fifteen or sixteen people to search in the nearby rivers and ponds, and went to Shijiazhuang and Zhengding, more than a hundred miles away. It took a total of three days and cost more than two dan of wheat, but he could not find his father. Jinmao was anxious and wanted to fight the other party in the lawsuit, but he was persuaded to stop. But on the ninth day, Ren Ruiying found Zhang Luoli in the guard class and said, "How are you going to settle this matter?" Luoli said, "The village had resolved it before." Ren Ruiying did not ask for details and let Luoli return to the village. The masses said: "What is this all about!"

(2) Wang Shufeng, a woman from Wangmang Village in the Fifth District, was often beaten and scolded by her husband. She applied to the court for divorce in February of this year. She has run to the district and county more than forty times in total (including thirty trips to the county court, each trip is sixty li back and forth, and she has to wade through water.) She is often sick from exhaustion. Two of her three children died due to lack of care, and the remaining one is still sick. Every time she went to the county, the court always said: "What are you in such a hurry for! The court doesn't only handle your case! Don't come again, wait for the judgment!" She was so angry that she often cried. In June, the court granted the divorce. However, the court lacked investigation on the issue of land division between the couple. Because the two sides disputed, the court ruled four times and changed it four times, and has not made a final decision yet.

(3) In the divorce case of Ma Ruihua, a woman from Xiwang Village in the Fourth District, Ma disagreed after the village mediation and filed a complaint with the county court. Ren Ruiying from the court replied, "Go find whoever mediated for you, we don't care." Ma asked, "My matter was handled by someone else, I don't agree, who do I ask to take care of it if not you!" Ren said, "What should be taken care of will be taken care of, and what shouldn't be taken care of won't be taken care of." Ma asked again, "What should be taken care of and what shouldn't be taken care of?" Ren said, "Your matter shouldn't be taken care of!"

Similar situations are numerous, and cannot be listed one by one. I hope that the Xinle County People's Court will conduct an inspection in this rectification campaign.

"Unprincipled Leniency, Invalid Judgments"

Comrades Editors:

The Yutian County Court has many problems in handling civil and criminal cases. For example, in a debt dispute of the Xing family, the government summoned the defendant eight times, but the debtor ignored it and made the plaintiff wait for eight days without getting a resolution. A woman from Liguantun requested a divorce, but the man was unwilling to divorce, forcing the woman to go to the county six times, delaying the resolution for thirty-two days. The land dispute between Wu Jinggang and Wu Meihua in Wujiaxuan Village was handled by the village, but Wu disagreed. It was handled by the district, but Wu still disagreed. Later, the county court made a judgment, but Wu Jinggang still disagreed. However, he neither appealed nor enforced the judgment, and continued to act like a rogue in the village. The issue of the house between Zhang Buxian and Zhang Bulan in Chewangzhuang Village was that the parents were raised by Bulan until they were old, and the property was inherited by Bulan. His father had a will before his death, and there was a contract as evidence. However, Zhang Buxian disagreed. This issue was not resolved in the district, and then the judge Qi of the county People's Court said in the village that it would be resolved in the county. But it has been more than a month, and Zhang Bulan has not gotten the house, and the problem is still shelved, which made Zhang Bulan cry several times. In rural areas, there are many debt problems. The court rules that someone has to repay the debt, but people don't enforce it, and there is no way to do anything about it. Some debtors, seeing this situation, do not repay even if they have money. This has led to a stagnation of rural lending.

The handling of criminal cases is also very delayed. This spring, the Eleventh District of our county captured a highway robber who killed a pedestrian with a wooden stick. They sent the criminal to the court three months ago, but it is unknown how it will be handled. The masses are gossiping behind their backs. I think unprincipled leniency is wrong. If bad elements do not receive due punishment, it will affect social order, which violates the interests of the people. I hope that governments at all levels will pay attention to this issue.

Lax Supervision System, Prisoners Escape Constantly

Comrades Editors:

The Cangxian Special District Court Detention Center does not strictly manage prisoners, allowing them to enter and exit freely, so escapes occur constantly. After some criminals with major crimes escape the law, they continue to harm the masses. As far as we know, only the criminals sent by the Cangxian Public Security Bureau have escaped twenty-one people.

1. Last December, the Cangxian Public Security Bureau investigated and captured a gang of bandits, Wang Shugong, Zhao Wenhui, and others, a total of six people. After investigation and summary, they were sent to the court for sentencing on February 25th of this year. In less than a month, Wang Shugong fled to the Jianguo County area to carry out activities, and threatened to say: "I will do it big once (referring to robbery), it's a profit to die!" Zhao Wenhui also escaped on June 14th while going out to work.

2. Wang Xianbu, a gang theft offender, escaped three days after being sent to the court. Now he is openly threatening the masses with a gun, saying: "I just steal things and mess with women, what if the government arrests me?! I know who is reporting me, be careful in the future! I will definitely deal with you."

After the above-mentioned criminals escaped, the interests of the masses were once again harmed, arousing dissatisfaction among the masses towards the government. We suggest that the Cangxian Special District Branch Court conduct an in-depth review, clarify responsibilities, and take effective measures to ensure that such incidents do not occur again in the future.

### 请各地人民法院  倾听群众呼声改进法院工作

　　请各地人民法院
    倾听群众呼声改进法院工作
    编者按：我们不断地收到读者的来函和来稿，批评人民法院的工作和干部作风。有不少读者并远道跑来提意见。其中有一些案件不一定是目前人民法院处理案件的重心，但对人民生活的关系，十分密切。我们在这里发表读者意见的一部分，希望各地法院注意检查。
    新乐县的三个案件编辑同志：
    新乐县人民法院在处理案件中，有许多官僚主义的错误，群众很不满意。现在我告诉你们几个例子。
    （一）新乐二区木村村民张洛利与张兰臣的母亲为过去的伙草棚起了纠纷，发生了打架事件。兰臣的母亲告到区，未得到适当解决，又告到县。县法院把被告张洛利传来后，书记员任瑞英不问理由即把被告扣押起来（书记员为何有这么大的权？——编者）。当天有该村周洛占来询问，任瑞英说：“洛利已偷跑回去。”并叫原告捎信回去找。洛利之子张金毛和村长田荣锁等到县询问。任瑞英说：“明明人已经跑回去，你们还向这里要人，这一定是你们捣鬼。”张金毛以为父亲已寻死或者被人所害，便立即找了十五、六人到附近各河及水坑寻找，并到百里以外的石家庄、正定一带寻找。共费时三天，花费小麦两石余，未找到下落。金毛着急了，要与诉讼对方拚命，经劝说才停止。但第九天上，任瑞英却在看守班找到了张洛利，说：“你这事怎么了结一下呀？”洛利说：“从前村中给解决过。”任瑞英即不问情由，又放洛利回村。群众说：“这算怎么回事呀！”
    （二）五区王莽村妇女王淑凤常受丈夫打骂，从今年二月就到法院申请离婚。她一共到区里和县里跑了四十多趟（其中到县法院三十趟，每趟来回六十里，还要淌水。）累得时常生病。三个孩子因照顾不周，病死两个，剩下一个现在还病着。每次到县时，法院总是说：“你着什么急！法院不是光管你这一件事！不用再来了，等判决吧！”气得她经常大哭。六月间，法院判决离婚了。但对于夫妇分地问题，法院缺乏调查，因双方争持，连续判了四次，改了四次，至今未作最后决定。
    （三）四区西王村妇女马瑞花离婚案，因村中调解之后马不同意，向县法院提出控诉。法院任瑞英回答说：“谁给你调解的你找谁去，我们不管。”马问：“我的事情是别人包办解决的，我不同意，不找你们管找谁管呀！”任说：“该管的管，不该管的就不管。”马又问：“什么事该管，什么事不该管？”任说：“你这事就不该管！”
    类似的情况还很多，不能一一列举。希望新乐县人民法院在这次整风中进行检查。

    “宽大无边  判决无效”编辑同志：
    玉田县法院在处理民事刑事案件中，有许多问题。例如邢家的一件债务纠纷问题，政府传被告八次，欠债户一直置之不理，使原告等了八天，也没得到解决。李官屯一个妇女请求离婚，男方死不愿离，使女方去县六次，拖延三十二天才解决。吴家选村吴景刚与吴美华的土地纠纷，经村里处理，吴不同意，经区处理，吴仍不同意，后经县法院判决了，吴景刚仍不同意。但他既不上诉，也不执行判决，还在村中耍无赖。车王庄张部先与张部兰的房子问题，父母是部兰养活到老，房产由部兰继承。他父亲临终有遗言，并有契约为凭。可是张部先不同意。这问题在区上没得到解决，后经县人民法院齐审判员在该村说好到县解决。但至今一月多了，张部兰还没得到房子，问题还在搁着，气的张部兰大哭几次。在农村中有许多债务问题，法院判决某人还债，人家不执行，也没有办法。有些欠债户看到这种情形，便有钱也不还。这就使农村借贷陷于停滞。
    在处理刑事案件上，也拖延的很利害。今春，我县十一区拿获路劫犯一名，该犯手持木棍打死一名行人。他们把该犯送到法院已有三月之久，不知如何处理。群众背后议论纷纷。我觉得无原则的宽大是不对的。如果坏分子受不到应有的处罚，就要影响社会秩序，这是违反人民的利益的。我希望各地政府注意此一问题。

    看管制度不严  犯人不断逃跑编辑同志：
    沧县专区法院看守所对犯人管理不严，让他们自由出入，因此不断发生逃跑事件。一些罪恶大的犯人逃脱法网后，仍在危害群众。据我们所知，仅沧县公安局送去的案犯，即逃跑二十一名。
    一、去年十二月沧县公安局查获伙匪王树贡、赵文会等六名，侦讯总结后，于今年二月二十五日送法院判刑。不到一月时间，王树贡即潜逃建国县一带活动，并扬言说：“要大干一次（指抢劫），死了是赚头！”赵文会亦于六月十四日外出生产时逃脱。
    二、集伙偷盗犯王先布送法院三天即潜逃。现拿抉枪一支公开威胁群众说：“我就是偷东西、搞女人，政府逮捕我去怎么啦？！谁反映我的，我也知道，以后留点神吧！我非把你们治过来不可。”
    以上案犯逃跑后，群众利益再次受到损害，惹起群众对政府的不满。我们建议沧县专区分院深入检讨，弄清责任，采取有效措施，保证今后不再发生此类事件。
