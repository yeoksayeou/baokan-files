　　Bolshevik Methods of Educating Cadres
    S. Jiuning, Secretary of the Voronezh City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
    Editor's Note: Comrade Stalin has repeatedly taught us that criticism and self-criticism are the keys to exposing and overcoming various shortcomings and errors in the cause of national construction, and to continuously advancing the cause of the country. Following the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on April 19, criticism and self-criticism have developed to some extent within the entire Party, governments at all levels, and various people's organizations. However, phenomena of suppressing democracy and refusing criticism under various pretexts have also been discovered in various places, along with egregious behaviors of retaliating against critics. In order to enable everyone to consciously and deliberately grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism and wage an irreconcilable struggle against bureaucracy, which seriously endangers the cause of the Party and the people, we are reprinting the article "Bolshevik Methods of Educating Cadres" written by S. Jiuning, Secretary of the Voronezh City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).
    Comrade Stalin profoundly elucidated the significance of criticism and self-criticism as a constant and effective weapon in the Bolshevik Party's arsenal, a reliable method for consolidating the Soviet state, and a powerful driving force for our society's advancement along the path of communism.
    ——Criticism and self-criticism is a key——Comrade Stalin taught——with this key, we can expose and overcome shortcomings in socialist construction and move forward. The secret of our progress lies here.
    Further achievements in communist construction are inextricably linked to the development of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, which helps to expose errors and shortcomings in the daily work of Party, Soviet, and economic departments. Self-criticism is a special method of Bolshevik education of cadres. It cultivates in all our staff a sense of intolerance towards shortcomings and a desire for new achievements.
    The report-back and election meetings held earlier this year, as well as the Party Congresses in various districts and Voronezh City, demonstrated the growing activeness of Communist Party members and their irreconcilability with shortcomings in practical work. At these meetings and congresses, Communist Party members, in their speeches, sharply criticized the serious laxity and errors in the work of the district committees and the city committee. At the same time, they also put forward many valuable suggestions for improving the work of the Party.
    The district committees and the city committee, implementing the resolutions of the meetings and congresses, began to become sensitive to the voices of Communist Party members and non-Party working masses, promptly responding to criticism and suggestions from below, in order to overcome shortcomings in their work. The development of criticism and self-criticism has enhanced the combat effectiveness of Party organizations and improved the level of Party organizational work and Party political work.
    Only in an environment of open and sincere criticism can truly Bolshevik cadres be educated. Criticism not only helps to quickly overcome shortcomings and errors but also prevents the danger of complacency and self-satisfaction among staff.
    Regularly holding plenary sessions of the city committee and district committees, meetings of Party activists, and representative meetings is of great significance. If, in the past, criticism at these meetings was top-down, now the plenary sessions and meetings of activists are held even better. The Party masses criticize shortcomings in their work without regard to personal feelings. Only in this way can the reasons why Party work and economic work are stuck at this or that stage be analyzed, and concrete steps to overcome the exposed shortcomings be planned.
    At a recent plenary session of the city committee, the report of the Komintern District Committee was discussed. It became clear that many serious negative phenomena in the work of the district committee were primarily attributable to Comrade Leikin, the district committee secretary. Instead of critically assessing the situation in the district, factors of complacency and self-satisfaction arose. This naturally reflected on the work. Those who attended the plenary session sharply and Bolshevikly criticized the working methods of the district committee secretary. It should be pointed out that the criticism was beneficial to Comrade Leikin. Many of the shortcomings pointed out at the plenary session have already been overcome.
    Experience shows that sometimes departments that leaders previously considered to be good will gradually begin to degenerate if they are not criticized and are not pointed out shortcomings in their work at all. For example, this was the case with Comrade Figisov, the former secretary of the Stalin District Committee. He used to be a very intelligent and proactive worker. But after a period of time, he no longer paid attention to the opinions of Party activists, believing himself to be a perfect leader. He gradually became less like a political worker and more like an administrative manager. Communist Party members' criticism had no effect on Comrade Figisov. More importantly, he even suppressed criticism.
    After the district committee staff learned about Figisov's incorrect methods, they addressed the issue. Figisov reached such a degree in this purely administrative work that he was eventually removed from his post. This fact was a practical lesson for the city committee. If the city committee could have delved deeper into the work of the district committee and the district committee secretary, it could have discovered the incorrect working methods earlier and corrected the work.
    Where the role of criticism and self-criticism is diminished, where the work of leaders is not checked daily, there one becomes too captivated by achievements. This leads leaders to ignore shortcomings and errors in their work. Here is a typical example.
    The Kalinin Factory has always been considered an advanced factory in the city. On the surface, everything was going smoothly. The plan was being completed "completely and totally." This factory had never left the city's Hall of Fame. The city committee did not critically approach Comrade Guancharenko, the factory director's victorious reports, believing his words and praising him in many ways. In such a situation, the factory director easily became dizzy with success. He did not soberly assess the achievements and consider the factory's future.
    The Party organization within the factory believed that it was "embarrassing" to point out that the factory director had become arrogant and conceited as a result of his achievements. The Party organization did not pay attention to the shortcomings in the factory's work. This indulgence quickly led the factory to fall into a "narrow position," with a series of loopholes appearing.
    The factory leaders, who had been praised without limit, tried to hide true criticism and embarked on a path of deception. This was manifested in the fact that behind the false victory, a series of plans to increase labor productivity were not completed, and the factory was producing poor-quality products.
    Now the city committee is resolutely fighting this phenomenon. The city committee also demands this of the district committees and Party grassroots organizations.
    In practice, there are also such situations where individual staff members are willing to acknowledge the benefits of criticism and self-criticism in words, but in fact, they not only fail to ensure the development of criticism but also try every means to suppress and restrain it.
    At a representative meeting of the academic conference of the Medical College, Comrade Kenisova, a Communist Party lecturer, rightly criticized the shortcomings in the leadership of the Medical College's scientific research work. Comrade Odnorarov, the director of the Medical College's academic affairs office and a Communist Party member, was very unhappy about this. He declared that Lecturer Kenisova's criticism of the leadership and of himself, Odnorarov, was "immature" and rudely interrupted Kenisova's speech. Clearly, Odnorarov's incorrect attitude towards criticism was not a unique occurrence.
    What was the reaction of the Medical College's Party branch? The Party branch took the attitude that nothing serious had happened. The Party branch was afraid of embarrassing Comrade Odnorarov and did not point out his mistakes, which gave similar incidents a chance to recur. The city committee and the Kaganovich District Committee must correct the branch's mistaken attitude.
    There are also frequent cases where individual leaders, after committing this or that mistake, do not hesitate to say that they are determined to correct it in the future. But after a period of time, this leader, who swore to "pay attention to criticism," disregards his conscience and relapses into his old mistakes.
    The machine-building and assembly department had failed to complete its production targets for more than two years, even though it had all the conditions to exceed them. Comrade Zhilenkov, the director of the machine-building and assembly department, had been pointed this out more than once. Each time, he verbally acknowledged his shortcomings in leading the manufacturing work, but in fact, everything remained the same. We must strictly warn these "promise-making" leaders and demand that they truly respond to criticism.
    It should be noted that the city committee must strengthen the fight against incidents of suppressing and persecuting criticism. But there are still cases where those who suppress criticism are not punished for a long time. We cite such an example.
    Comrade Luzhin, the fourth head of the Southeast Railway Branch, committed a very disgraceful act by protecting swindlers and embezzlers. Comrade Vereshagina, a member of the Communist Youth League, sincerely and openly criticized Comrade Luzhin. Comrade Luzhin quickly dismissed Vereshagina and attempted to pursue legal responsibility against her. When the Party branch learned of Luzhin's actions, it did not make any accusations against this arbitrary administrative cadre. In particular, Comrade Porozhantsev, the branch secretary, in order to curry favor with his "chief," also reached out to participate in slandering that upright person. The city committee severely punished Luzhin, who suppressed criticism, and pointed out the mistakes made by the branch.
    In practice, developing Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism and the attention the Party organization gives to the opinions of Communist Party members, letters and opinions of the working masses play a great role. In most cases, these letters reflect the masses' own desire to overcome this or that shortcoming. It reminds the leaders of what they should pay attention to. The opinions of ordinary people often help to expose shortcomings that leaders have not yet discovered.
    The city committee has strengthened the struggle against the formalistic treatment of letters from the working masses. We organized inspections of the handling of opinions and complaints from the working masses in more than 80 agencies in the city. The results of this inspection helped us uncover serious shortcomings in extremely important work and plan practical steps to improve the handling of letters and complaints from Communist Party members and non-Party working masses.
    Due to opinions from below, the city committee was able to expose the nepotism and cronyism in the agricultural department of the city executive committee. Comrade Grigorovich, the minister, abused his power for greedy purposes. Comrade Poletas, the branch secretary, knew all about this. But instead of boldly and Bolshevikly reporting the incorrect behavior of the leaders of his agency to the higher Party organs, he flattered and pleased his superiors, believing that this would ensure that he would not "fall out of favor." The Party branch secretary acted on the principle of: "I won't offend him, and he won't offend me."
    The coordination and closeness of Party and economic leadership is a decisive condition for the successful completion of current tasks. But coordination is different from nepotism. Party leaders must stand on the position of national interests and educate economic cadres in this spirit. He is obligated to expose shortcomings in his work with full decisiveness and set an example of bold, Bolshevik, and uncompromising criticism.
    Comrade Trenin, the Party organization secretary of the auto team of the automobile company, set an example of this kind of work attitude. Comrade Sherzhukov, the captain of the automobile team, committed nepotism in the selection of cadres, pulling in his close friends from previous jobs and suppressing others from criticizing him. Things reached such an extent that the wall newspaper could not be published without his review.
    Branch secretary Trenin handled the matter correctly by submitting Sherzhukov's issue to the Party branch for discussion. When it was clear that Sherzhukov was not treating criticism and his opinions with a Party-member attitude, the branch secretary transferred the issue to the district committee for discussion.
    The interests of the work require not concealing mistakes and shortcomings, but boldly exposing and quickly correcting them.
    The improvement of the level of criticism and self-criticism within the city's Party organizations will be significantly demonstrated in practical work. Our Party work cadres, Soviet cadres, and economic work cadres. Criticism warns them to avoid the dangers of stagnation and complacency, educates them in the sense of new things, and educates them to work skillfully everywhere and become truly disciplined cadres. Improving the work of cadres will promote the future improvement of political work and economic work. The fact that the city's industry completes its production plan every month illustrates this.
    The city's Party organizations educate leading cadres in the spirit of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, lead the struggle against shortcomings in their work, and are able to achieve new and more significant achievements in the daily work of all departments.

　　布尔什维克教育干部的方法
    联共（布）沃龙涅什市委书记  斯·玖宁
    编者按：斯大林同志曾一再教导我们，批评与自我批评，是揭露并克服国家建设事业中各种缺点与错误而使国家事业不断前进的钥匙。中共中央于四月十九日发布了“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”之后，在全党及各级人民政府，各人民团体中，批评与自我批评有了某些开展。但是，各地也发现了以各种各样的借口压制民主、拒绝批评的现象。并有以报复打击态度对待批评者的恶劣行为。为着使大家清醒地自觉地掌握批评与自我批评的武器，与严重危害党和人民事业的官僚主义进行不调和的斗争，特将联共（布）沃龙涅什市委书记斯·玖宁所写《布尔什维克教育干部的方法》一文转载如下。
    斯大林同志极深刻的阐明了批评与自我批评的意义，是布尔什维克党武器库里经常有效的武器，是巩固苏维埃国家可靠的方法，是我们社会沿共产主义道路前进强大的推动力量。
    ——批评与自我批评是一把钥匙——斯大林同志教导说——用这把钥匙，我们能揭露并克服社会主义建设中的缺点而且能够前进。我们进步的秘诀就在这里。
    共产主义建设进一步的成就与布尔什维克批评与自我批评的发展不可分的联系着，这批评与自我批评能帮助揭露出党的，苏维埃的，经济部门里每天工作中的错误和缺点。自我批评是布尔什维克教育干部特殊的方法。它培植着我们全部工作人员不能与缺点共存的感觉和求得新成就的志愿。
    今年年初，开过的听取报告并举行选举的会议，以及各区和沃龙涅什市党代表大会表明了共产党员成长着的积极性，他们在实际工作中对于缺点的不调和性。在这会议与代表大会上，共产党员们在自己的发言中，尖锐的批评了区委会和市委会在工作中严重的松弛和错误。同时他们也提出了许多改善党工作的宝贵意见。
    区委会及市委会执行着会议及代表大会的决议，开始对共产党员和非党劳动群众的呼声敏感起来，迅速的答复由下面而来的批评与建议，以求得克服工作中的缺点。批评与自我批评的展开提高党组织战斗性，提高了党的组织工作与党的政治工作的水平。
    只有在公开的，诚恳的批评环境中，才能真正的教育出布尔什维克的干部。批评不仅能帮助迅速的克服缺点和错误，而且也能预防工作人员自慰和自满的危险。
    正规的举办市委会和区委会的全体会议，党积极分子会议和代表会议是有着重大的意义。假如说过去在这些会议上的批评是由上而下的，那么现在全体会议及积极分子会议，就开得更好了。党内群众批评工作中的缺点是不顾情面的。只有这样，才能分析出党的工作及经济工作停留在这种或那种阶段上的原因并计划克服被揭露出来的缺点的具体步骤。
    在不久前的一次市委会全体会议上，讨论了科民捷勒诺夫区委会的报告。弄清楚了该区委会工作中许多严重的消极现象首先归咎于区委书记雷金同志。代替了批判的估量本区内工作的状况，而产生了自慰和自满的因素。这自然而然的就反映到工作上来了。参加全体会议的人们，尖锐的，布尔什维克式的批评了该区委书记的工作方法。应该指出，批评对雷金同志是有益处的。在全体会议上指出的缺点当中，很多已被克服了。
    经验证明，有时领导者过去认为是不错的部门，如果对他们不加批评，并完全不给他们指出在工作中的缺点，那就会逐渐开始堕落下来。例如斯大林区区委会过去的书记非吉索夫同志就是这样。他过去曾是一个很聪明，很主动的工作者。但过了一个时期，他也不注意党内积极分子的意见了，自认为是一个完美无缺的领导者。他渐渐的就不像是一个政治工作者，而像是一个行政管理人。共产党员的批评对非吉索夫同志不起作用。更重要的是他还有压制批评的情形。
    区委会的工作人员们知道了非吉索夫不正确的作法以后，把这个问题解决了。非吉索夫在这纯行政的工作中达到了这样一种程度，终于解除了他的工作。这个事实对市委会来说，真是上了实际的一课。如果市委会能深入区委会和区委书记的工作中去，他就能很早的发现错误的工作方法并能改正工作。
    那里降低了批评与自我批评的作用，那里不每天检查领导者的工作，那里就会过于被成绩迷惑住。这就使领导者不去注意工作中的缺点和错误。这是一个典型的例子。
    卡林尼娜工厂一向被认为是市内的一个先进的工厂。看外表一切都很顺利。计划是“总的并完全的”完成。这工厂从来未曾离过全市的光荣板。市委没有批判的来对待厂长关查连科同志胜利的报告，相信了他的话，多方的称赞了他。在这样的情况下，厂长很容易的冲昏了头脑，他没清醒的估计成绩，考虑工厂的明天。
    工厂内党的组织认为，指出厂长由于获得成绩而产生自高自大和自负的后果是很“不好意思的”。党组织不去注意工厂工作中的缺点。这一纵容就使工厂内很快的陷于“狭小的地位”，出现了一连串的漏洞。
    被无限度夸奖了的工厂领导者，企图隐匿真正的批评，走上了欺瞒的道路。表现在，在虚伪的胜利后面，隐藏着一系列的，没有完成提高劳动生产力的计划，工厂出产着质量恶劣的产品。
    现在市委会对此种现象进行了坚决的斗争。市委会对区委会及党的基层组织也是这样要求。
    实际也有这样情形，就是个别的工作人员在口头上也愿意承认批评与自我批评的益处，而事实上不仅不保证开展批评，却千方百计的压制和抑止批评。
    在医科专门学校学术会议的代表会议上，共产党员讲师坚尼索娃正当的批评了医专科学研究工作领导上的缺点。医专教务处主任共产党员奥得诺拉罗夫同志很不高兴这点，他声明说坚尼索娃讲师对领导上和他奥得诺拉罗夫本人的批评是“不成熟”，而粗野的打断了坚尼索娃的发言。很明白，奥得诺拉罗夫这种对批评不正确的态度并不是独一无二的事情。
    医专党支部的反应是怎样呢？党支部却抱着一种没有什么了不起事情发生的态度。党支部怕使奥得诺拉罗夫同志难堪，没有指出他的错误，于是这就给了类似事件复发的机会。市委及卡岗诺维赤区委会必须纠正该支部的错误态度。
    经常也有这样的情况，个别的领导者犯了此种或彼种错误以后，不惜说以后确信去改正。但过了一段时间，这发誓“注意批评”的领导者昧着良心重新复犯了旧有的错误。
    机器制造装配部在二年多的过程中没有完成生产任务，虽然具备着一切可以超过任务的条件。关于这事曾不止一次的对机器制造装配部长日连科夫同志指出过。每次以后，他都在口头上承认了自己在领导制造工作上的缺点，而事实上却是一切如旧。我们必须严格的警告这些“只作诺言”的领导者，并要求他们对批评有所真正的反应。
    应该注意，市委会要加强对压制和迫害批评事件的斗争。但还有这样的情况，压制批评的人很久也受不到惩处。我们举一个这样的例子。
    东南铁道第四股长芦金同志作出了很不名誉的事，包庇了骗子和贪污分子。共青团员维耶列沙金娜同志诚恳的公开的对芦金同志进行了批评。芦金同志很快的就把维耶列沙金娜免职，并企图向她追究法律上的责任。党支部知道了芦金的行动，没有对这专横的行政干部作任何的指责。尤其是支部书记波罗然柴夫同志，为讨好于“首长”，他也伸手参与中伤那正直的人。市委会严格的处罚了压制批评的芦金同志并对该支部指出了支部所犯的错误。
    实际开展布尔什维克的批评与自我批评，党组织注意的看待共产党员的意见，劳动群众的信件和意见，是起着很大的作用的。在大多数的情况下，这些信件是反映着群众本身对克服此种或彼种缺点的愿望。他提醒领导者们应当注意什么。普通的人们的意见经常能帮助揭发那些领导者尚未发现的缺点。
    市委会加强了与形式上对待劳动群众信件的斗争。我们在市内八十余个机关里组织了对劳动群众的意见与申述处理情况的检查。这个检查的结果，帮助了我们揭发在极重要工作上的严重缺点并计划出改善对待共产党员及非党劳动群众的信件及申述的工作的实际步骤。
    由于从下面来的意见，市委会才能揭露出在市执委会农业部里的家族观念和亲友观念。部长格利高罗维赤同志为了贪婪的目的而滥用职权。该支部书记波勒塔斯同志关于这一切他都知道。但代替大胆的，布尔什维克式的向上级党机关提出本机关领导者不正确行为的，却是在其首长面前謟媚讨好，以为这就可以保险他不致“失宠”。党支部书记是本着：“我不犯他，他也别犯我”的原则办事的。
    党的与经济的领导工作协调而亲密，是顺利完成当前任务的决定条件。但协调是与家族观念不同的。党的领导者是要站在国家利益的立场上，并以这个精神来教育经济干部。他有义务以全付的果断性揭发工作中的缺点并作出大胆的，布尔什维克式的，不顾情面批评的榜样。
    汽车公司汽车队党组织书记特列宁同志就作出了这种工作态度的范例。汽车队长谢勒玖科夫同志在选调干部问题上犯了家族观念，从以前的工作岗位上，把自己亲近的人拉来，压制别人批评。事情竟到达了这样程度，墙报如不经过他审查都不能出刊。
    支部书记特列宁同志处理得很正确，把谢勒玖科夫的问题提交党支部讨论。当谢勒玖科夫很明显的不是以党员的态度对待批评和对他的意见时，支部书记把这问题转交给了区委会讨论。
    工作的利益要求的不是掩饰错误和缺点，而是大胆的揭露和迅速改正它。
    城市党组织内批评与自我批评水准的提高，在实际工作中会得到显著的说明。我们的党工作干部，苏维埃的干部及经济工作干部。批评警告着他们躲开停滞不前，墨守成规的危险，教育他们对新鲜事物的感觉，教育他们到处都熟练工作并成为真正而有节操的干部。改善干部工作就会促进将来政治工作及经济工作的提高。本市工业月月的完成生产计划的事实就说明了这一点。
    城市党组织以布尔什维克的批评与自我批评的精神教育着领导干部，领导向工作中的缺点进行斗争，能够在各部门每日的工作中获得新的，富有更大意义的成就。
