　　Northeast China: Opinions expressed by Bi Yulan and other model Youth League members
    [Our Newspaper's News] Many model Youth League members in Northeast China have expressed their determination to resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Bi Yulan, a seventeen-year-old female League member and special-class model of military industry, said: "American imperialism openly engages in armed intervention in Korea and妄想 attempts to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. We, the working class, are not afraid at all. We must further unite workers and technicians, improve quality and output, and support the People's Liberation Army. We firmly believe that Taiwan will definitely be liberated." Wang Weibin, the first-class labor model of Songjiang Province, who created the national record for telegraph operators and is famous among hundreds of thousands of postal and telecommunications workers across the country, said: "We will use practical actions to oppose American imperialism's aggression and defend world peace." Tong Junshan, the new record creator of the Shenyang Fifth Machinery Factory, said: "We must step up production to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan as soon as possible, and let the American imperialists and all war-mongers climb into self-made coffins like Hitler." Du Kuishan, the second-class labor hero of the Northeast Railway and model young foreman of the Shenyang Railway Telecommunications Section who eliminated accidents, Li Zhen, a staff member of Xinhua Bookstore and model League member, and Kang Jingcui, a young technician from the Shenyang Chemical Plant, also unanimously expressed their determination to use their practical actions to completely shatter the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism and all war-mongers.

    【本报讯】东北许多模范青年团员纷纷表示坚决反对美国帝国主义侵略台湾和朝鲜的决心。军工特等模范、十七岁的女团员毕玉兰说：“美帝公开武装干涉朝鲜，并妄想阻止中国人民解放台湾，我们工人阶级，一点也不害怕，我们要更进一步的团结工友和技术人员，提高质量产量，支援人民解放军。我们坚决相信：台湾一定能解放。”首创全国报务员最高纪录、在全国十几万邮电员中闻名的松江省一等劳动模范王维本说：“我们要用实际行动来反对美帝侵略，来保卫世界和平。”沈阳第五机械厂新纪录创造者佟俊山说：“我们要加紧生产，支援人民解放军早日解放台湾，叫美帝及一切战争贩子们，像希特勒一样，爬进自做的棺材里。”东北铁路二等劳动英雄、沈阳铁路电务段消灭事故的模范青年工长杜魁山，新华书店职员、模范团员李珍，沈阳化工厂青年技术员康景萃等也都一致表示要用自己的实际行动彻底粉碎美国帝国主义及一切战争贩子的侵略阴谋。
