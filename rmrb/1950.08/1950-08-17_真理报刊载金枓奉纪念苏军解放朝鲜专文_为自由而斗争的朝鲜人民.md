Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th (TASS): To commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Korea from Japanese imperialist enslavement, "Pravda" published an article entitled "The Korean People Fighting for Freedom" by Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea.

Kim Tu-bong first emphasized that in the Soviet Army soldiers, the Korean people saw for the first time in their history soldiers who came to Korea as liberators rather than enslavers. Subsequently, he devoted the majority of the article to discussing the economic achievements of the Korean people. As he pointed out, large-scale Soviet assistance greatly facilitated these achievements for the Korean people.

The author wrote: "The Soviet Union respects the rights of our people and harbors warm fraternal feelings towards them. The Soviet Union gave us all kinds of assistance in carrying out the arduous task of eliminating the consequences of the Japanese colonial rule and developing the Korean economy, culture, and politics in all aspects."

"Soviet troops helped us restore enterprises, railways, transportation, hospitals, and schools that were destroyed by the Japanese during their hasty retreat. Whether large or small, the Soviet government sincerely and enthusiastically satisfied all the needs of our people in carrying out the arduous task of creating a young democratic country. It was Soviet doctors who helped our people get rid of the long-standing terrible infectious diseases—cholera and plague—for the first time in Korean history. They helped us find a treatment for the terrible oriental disease—encephalitis—which was previously considered incurable. The Soviet Union opened more than one hundred hospitals in Korea. The Soviet government helped the Korean people develop their economy, revive their culture, and build a new life with confidence."

The author continued: "Thanks to the Soviet Union's selfless assistance, and thanks to the selfless labor of workers, farmers, and intellectuals, North Korea has made historically unprecedented leaps and bounds in the past five years. As early as 1948, the industrial output of northern Korea increased as follows compared to 1946: coal mining industry by 285.4 percent, steel industry by 572 percent, and chemical industry by 216 percent. The total industrial output more than doubled. Our laboring farmers have also achieved great success. Approximately 715,000 previously landless peasants, small landowners, and tenant farmers have been granted more than one million hectares of land free of charge in accordance with the Land Reform Law. The cultural level of the Korean people has been immeasurably improved. After forty years of enslavement and humiliating national oppression, our people have for the first time obtained the right to freely converse in their native language, the right to educate their children, and all the possibilities to enjoy our richest cultural heritage. While promoting culture, the welfare of the people in the northern part of the republic is also steadily increasing."

"The wages of Korean workers in 1949 have increased by more than 50 percent compared to 1947, and, moreover, the prices of food and manufactured goods have been reduced many times during the same period. Huge amounts of funds are being allocated for social insurance, public health, and medical care."

The author said: "The fate of the people in South Korea is completely different."

"The Syngman Rhee clique, which seized power in South Korea with the help of American bayonets, has followed a policy of turning South Korea into a colony of American imperialism from the very beginning. The people have been deprived of all democratic freedoms, and all democratic parties and mass organizations have been banned and driven underground."

"The Syngman Rhee clique has established a detestable military police rule, under which people are imprisoned or brutally executed without any trial or investigation for the slightest patriotic act."

"More than 150,000 of our compatriots have been tortured and killed by the Syngman Rhee executioners, and approximately 500,000 are languishing in prison. Each of them is persecuted mainly because they demanded the withdrawal of American troops and loudly supported the unification and independence of Korea. The Americans have in fact become the masters of all important industrial enterprises, and they ruthlessly plunder Korea's natural wealth. At the same time, machine engineering, textile, and other manufacturing industries have been completely destroyed, so that Wall Street businessmen can sell their outdated goods in Korea and obtain incredibly high profits. ... The Syngman Rhee government talks a lot about land reform, but does not implement it."

"Korea's richest ancient culture is being trampled on and destroyed. The number of Korean schools is decreasing year by year. The majority of Korean residents are still illiterate. The Syngman Rhee clique is using all means to obstruct the peaceful unification of our motherland and is frantically preparing to launch a fratricidal civil war."

Kim Tu-bong, in referring to the American aggression against Korea, stated: "The American colonial policy has now taken the form of open armed aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the same time, the fratricidal civil war imposed on the Korean people by the Syngman Rhee clique has become a war of liberation for the Korean people against the American aggressors—a war for freedom and unification, for the independence of the motherland. Under the call of Premier Kim Il-sung, all our people have united to carry out this sacred war."

"Our young People's Army, without combat experience, is not only able to defeat Syngman Rhee's puppet army, but also to compete with the heavily armed and 'showy' American army, forcing them to flee, and now they have been driven to a small patch of land near the Sea of Japan, the size of which is less than one-tenth of the land of South Korea."

Kim Tu-bong specifically pointed out: "Today, fifty days after the outbreak of the Korean War, the Syngman Rhee army, the so-called 'National Assembly,' and the South Korean government no longer exist. Currently, the war between the Korean people and the American aggressors is being fought on Korean soil; there is no doubt that if there had been no American armed intervention, the Korean civil war would have ended long ago, and our people would have achieved national unification and gained freedom."

　　真理报刊载金枓奉纪念苏军解放朝鲜专文
    为自由而斗争的朝鲜人民
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日电：《真理报》为纪念苏军自日本帝国主义奴役下解放朝鲜五周年，特发表朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉题为《为自由而斗争的朝鲜人民》一文。
    金枓奉首先强调指出：在苏军战士身上，朝鲜人民有史以来第一次看见了以解放者而不是以奴役者的身份来到朝鲜的战士。随后，他便以该文的大部分论述朝鲜人民的经济成就。正如他们指出的，苏联大规模的援助大大地便利了朝鲜人民达到了这些成就。
    作者写道：苏联尊重我国人民的权利，对我国人民怀着热烈的兄弟之情。在我们执行清除日本殖民统治，对朝鲜经济、文化、政治各方面的发展所造成的灾难性后果这一艰难的任务时，苏联给了我们所有一切的援助。
    苏军部队帮助我们恢复了日人在仓促退却时摧毁的企业、铁路、运输、医院与学校。事无大小，苏联政府都怀着真心诚意，热情地满足我国人民在执行艰难的任务——创造年青的民主国家——中的一切需要。是苏联的医生，在朝鲜有史以来第一次帮助我国人民摆脱了由来已久的可怕的传染病——霍乱与鼠疫。他们帮助我们找出可怕的东方病——脑炎的治疗方法，这种病过去一直认为是不治之症。苏联在朝鲜开办了一百余所医院。苏联政府帮助朝鲜人民发展了朝鲜的经济，复兴了他们的文化，使他们充满信心地建设新的生活。
    作者继称：由于苏联大公无私的援助，也由于工人、农民与知识分子忘我地劳动，北朝鲜过去五年中已有了历史上空前的飞跃发展。早在一九四八年，朝鲜北部工业产量与一九四六年相比便有了下面这些增加：采煤工业百分之二八五点四，炼钢工业百分之五七二，化学工业百分之二一六。工业总产量增加了一倍多。我们的劳动农民也获得了巨大的成就。约有七十一万五千名前无地农民、小土地所有者以及雇农，已依照土地改革法，免费获得了一百万公顷以上的土地。朝鲜人民的文化水平已无可衡量地提高了。经过了四十年奴役和屈辱的民族压迫之后，我国人民头一次获得了用他们本国的语言来自由交谈的权利，获得了教育他们孩子的权利，和享受我国最丰富的文化遗产的一切可能。与发扬文化同时，共和国北部人民的福利也在稳步增进。
    朝鲜工人一九四九年的工资已较一九四七年增加了百分之五十以上，何况，同一时期中食物与制成品的价格又曾多次减低。巨额资金正拨作社会保险、公共卫生与医疗的经费。
    作者说：南朝鲜人民所遭遇到的命运却有天渊之别。
    借助于美国人的刺刀而在朝鲜南部掌政的李承晚集团，上台伊始，即遵循着把南朝鲜变成美帝国主义的殖民地的政策。人民被剥夺了一切民主自由，一切民主的政党和群众组织都横遭禁止，被驱入地下。
    李承晚集团建立了可憎可怖的军事警察统治，在这个统治下面，人民竟因最微小的爱国举动而未经任何审讯或调查便被投入狱中，或惨遭处决。
    我们的同胞已有十五万以上被李承晚刽子手酷刑虐杀，约有五十万憔悴狱中。他们每一个人之所以受迫害，主要是因为他们曾要求美军撤退，并高声拥护朝鲜的统一与独立。美国人事实上已成为一切重要的工业企业的主子，他们无情地掠夺朝鲜的天然财富。同时，机器工程、纺织及其他制造工业已被摧毁净尽，因为这样才可以让华尔街的生意佬在朝鲜销售其陈腐货物，并获得令人难以置信的高额利润。……李承晚政府大谈其土地改革，然而却不实行。
    朝鲜人民最丰富的古代文化被蹂躏、毁灭了。朝鲜学校的数目一年年地减少。朝鲜居民的大多数仍然是文盲。李承晚集团用种种方法来阻挠我们祖国和平统一的实现，并且疯狂地准备发动同族相残的内战。
    金枓奉在说到美国侵略朝鲜一事称：美国的殖民政策现在采取了公开武装侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的方式，同时，李承晚集团强加于朝鲜人民身上的同族相残的内战一开始就成了朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略者的解放战争——这个战争是为了自由与统一、为了祖国的独立而进行的。我们全体人民在金日成首相的号召下，一致起来进行这个神圣的战争。
    我们没有战斗经验的年青人民军不仅能击溃李承晚的傀儡军队，更能与武装到了牙齿的“耀武扬威”的美国军队匹敌，迫使他们溃逃，而现在已把他们赶到日本海附近一小撮土地上，其范围的大小尚不足南朝鲜土地的十分之一。
    金枓奉特别指出：今天，朝鲜战事爆发了五十天以后，李承晚的军队、所谓“国民议会”以及南朝鲜政府已不复存在了。目前，朝鲜人民与美国侵略者之间的战争正在朝鲜土地上进行着；毫无疑问，如果没有美国武装干涉的话，朝鲜的内战老早就结束了，而我们的人民也早就取得了全国的统一、获得了自由。
