　　Lingshou, Gaocheng and Other County Leading Organs
    Disregard Mass Demands and Ignore Newspaper Criticism
    Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee Instructs All Counties to Overcome Bureaucratism
    The leading organs of Lingshou, Gaocheng, Shulu and other counties under the Shijiazhuang Special District have disregarded newspaper criticism and ignored the opinions and demands of the masses. This bureaucratic style should be seriously examined and corrected.
    In May and June, a total of 22 articles criticizing the organs or individuals of counties under the Shijiazhuang Special District were published in the People's Daily and the Hebei Daily, plus 26 inspection clues prompted by the Provincial Party Committee. Only six of these had their results announced in the newspapers. (The handling of the Gaocheng court's obstruction of Zhao Xiaoyan's marriage autonomy was relatively timely). Eight cases were resolved but not answered, and thirteen cases were delayed without resolution or any news. For some incidents, the Prefectural Committee urged inquiries three times, but the County Committee and responsible departments still ignored them. The situation of disregarding mass opinion and rejecting criticism is roughly as follows:
    1. Disregarding the interests of the masses. Delaying and prevaricating on the demands raised by the masses, failing to resolve them earnestly or in a timely manner. For example, deviations occurred in the correction of deviations in Guanzhuang Village, Lingshou (see People's Daily, May 11). The district cadres forcibly returned the house that Hao Zhengfang, a poor family of revolutionary martyrs, had been allocated to the landlord Hao Wubao. During the Chinese New Year, Hao Wubao even colluded with village cadre Hao Zhengye to force Hao Zhengfang to write an IOU. Hao Zhengfang's second son died in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and his third son joined the People's Liberation Army. The local government not only failed to care for such an elderly person, but also wanted to drive him out of the house he had already acquired ownership of during the equal distribution. The old man Hao Zhengfang had requested the county government to resolve the housing problem reasonably. The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China had also urged the Lingshou County Committee three times to assist the county government in resolving this issue, but until now, Hao Zhengfang's problem has not been resolved. On May 28, the Hebei Daily published a report that Qi Jiyun and other cadres from Nanjie, Pingshan, infringed on the property rights of resident He Shengshan (sealing the house and confiscating furniture). The Pingshan County Government did not begin to deal with it until late June.
    2. Conniving at and shielding cadres' mistakes. For example, Gao, the district chief of the former Eighth District of Shulu, accepted 180,000 yuan in congratulatory gifts from Dongcao Village when he got married, and therefore praised the cadres of Dongcao Village (including the village armed committee director who had a bad style and had committed serious mistakes) for having "merit." After this incident was discovered and raised by students of the North China Bureau Party School, it has been transferred level by level by the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Committee to the Shulu County Committee for examination, but there has been no follow-up yet. Another example: When the Gaocheng Court resolved the case of Dong Gouzha and two others stealing the fruits of victory in Beilou Village last year, it ruled that Dong and others should return 9.3 million yuan of the former Jin-Cha-Ji border currency (equivalent to 80 dou of rice at that time, but now it can only be exchanged for more than 9,000 yuan in Renminbi, enough to buy 10 jin of rice). However, the fine has never been returned to the farmers of the village, but was used by the court as "production" funds. After the court was publicly criticized for obstructing Zhao Xiaoyan's marriage autonomy, the masses of Beilou Village dared to directly report and question the special district. The Prefectural Committee sent letters to the Gaocheng County Committee twice for this purpose, and also urged Gaocheng County Chief Wen to seize the opportunity to deal with it at the summer requisition meeting, but it has not been resolved yet.
    3. Fear of and rejection of criticism. Even if they admit their mistakes verbally, they cannot get their minds straight ideologically. For example, after Meng Guangwen, the propaganda committee member of the Shulu Old City Branch of the Communist Party of China, wrote a report suggesting that the county government "protect and repair the electric poles and wires connecting the old city to the new city" (see Hebei Daily, June 17), the Civil Affairs Section of the Shulu County Government called him from forty miles away to the county to "reprimand" him (Meng reported this to the Propaganda Department of the County Committee, but the Civil Affairs Section denied having "reprimanded" him). After the newspaper criticized the bureaucracy in the management of the Lingzheng Canal, which flooded 400 mu of land four times, the comrades in charge of the canal management committee could not get their minds straight ideologically for a long time. Some even said: "If there is a mistake, the County Committee should point it out face to face, why publish it in the newspaper!?"
    4. Turning a blind eye to phenomena that violate policies. In April, according to students of the North China Bureau Party School, the following erroneous statements were circulating among the masses in the first district of Lingshou: "Restore agricultural production in three to five years, restore industrial production in ten or eight years, and then engage in equal distribution." Some people even sold the land and houses they had obtained in the land reform. The Prefectural Committee instructed the Lingshou County Committee to investigate and study this situation. However, the County Committee did not pay attention to this issue.
    There are three reasons for the above phenomenon: First, some county committee leading organs have not paid enough attention to the decision of the Party Central Committee on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, have not studied it seriously, or have studied it very superficially, and have not linked it with reality to conduct in-depth inspection of work. As a result, some leading organs are afraid of criticism, block communication staff and correspondents, and do not conduct self-criticism after being criticized. Second, there is a serious bureaucratic style in the leadership of some county committees, trapping themselves in a circle of busy affairs, rarely concentrating on considering the Party's policies and the interests of the masses, and treating many major issues related to policies and the lives of the masses as personal trivial matters and ignoring them. Third, there are no sound inspection agencies and inspection systems in the county leadership. Most counties have not set up inspection secretaries, and no one is specifically responsible for inspection work.
    In order to overcome this bureaucratic style, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee instructed the county committees of all counties: Those who have not set up inspection secretaries should set them up as soon as possible and establish an inspection work system. The inspection secretaries should record at any time the criticisms raised by the newspapers, the incidents designated by the Prefectural Committee for inspection, the important problems discovered in the county that have not been resolved, etc., urge those who are criticized to make self-criticism, and for those with serious problems, request the County Committee to assign special personnel or organize inspection teams to conduct inspection and handling, and organize cadres to go to the countryside to collect reports. The inspection results should be announced in the newspapers.
    Editor's note: The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee's emphasis on the spirit of newspaper criticism is very correct, but the method of establishing "inspection secretaries" is not sufficient. Because the Party Central Committee's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals stipulates that after criticism is published in newspapers and periodicals, "if the criticized person refuses to express an attitude, or retaliates against the critic, the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee should deal with it. If the above situation violates administrative laws, the state's supervisory and judicial organs should deal with it." Furthermore, the Party Central Committee has stipulated that discipline inspection committees at all levels must set up certain working organs. Therefore, we believe that it is not necessary to specifically set up inspection secretaries to deal with criticism issues, and these tasks should be handed over to the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee and the government's supervisory and judicial organs for handling.

### 灵寿藁城等县领导机关  漠视群众要求忽视报纸批评  石家庄地委指示各县克服官僚主义

　　灵寿藁城等县领导机关
    漠视群众要求忽视报纸批评
    石家庄地委指示各县克服官僚主义
    石家庄专区所属灵寿、藁城、束鹿等县领导机关忽视报纸批评，漠视群众意见与要求。这种官僚主义作风，应认真检查纠正。
    五、六月份，在人民日报及河北日报上发表批评石家庄专区所属各县机关或个人的稿件共二十二件，加上省委提示的检查线索共二十六件。在报纸上公布了处理结果的只有六件。（藁城法院阻挠赵小烟婚姻自主事件处理较及时）。有八件解决后未答复，有十三件拖延未解决或者无音信。有些事件，地委督促查询三次，县委及负责部门仍不理睬。漠视群众意见拒绝批评的情况大致有以下四种：
    一、漠视群众利益。对群众提出的要求拖延搪塞，不认真解决或不及时解决。如灵寿官庄村纠偏中发生偏向（见五月十一日人民日报）。区干部硬把贫苦烈属郝正芳分得的房子退还给地主郝五保。过年时郝五保还纠合村干郝正业找郝正芳逼写借据。郝正芳的二小子抗日牺牲了，三小子参加了人民解放军。对这样的老人，当地政府不予关怀照顾。反而要将他从平分时已经取得所有权的房子里撵出去。郝正芳老人曾请求县政府合理地解决住房问题。中共石家庄地委也曾三次督促灵寿县委协助县政府去解决这一问题，但是直到现在郝正芳的问题，仍未见处理。五月二十八日，河北日报发表了平山南街干部齐吉云等侵犯居民何升三财产所有权（封闭房子，没收家具）的报道后，平山县府一直拖到六月下旬才开始处理。
    二、姑息包庇干部错误。如束鹿前八区区长高某，结婚时接受东曹村贺礼十八万元，因而夸奖东曹村干部（包括作风恶劣并犯过严重错误的村武委会主任）有“功”。这一事件经华北局党校学员发现提出后，已由省委地委逐级转令束鹿县委检查，至今尚无下文。再如：藁城法院去年解决北楼村董苟渣等三人偷盗胜利果实案件时，判决董等退还原晋察冀区边币九百三十万元（当时折米八十斗、到现在只能折人民币九千多元买米十斤）。但该项罚款一直未退还该村农民，而被法院当作了“生产”资金。该院因阻挠赵小烟婚姻自主被公开批评后，北楼村群众始敢直接向专区反映并提出质问。地委为此曾两次给藁城县委去信，在布置夏征的会议上又当面督促藁城温县长抓紧处理，但迄今仍未解决。
    三、害怕与拒绝批评。即使口头上认错，思想上也搞不通。如：中共束鹿旧城支部宣传委员孟广文写了建议县府“保护、修理旧城通新城的电杆、电线”的报道后（见六月十七日河北日报），束鹿县政府民政科，把他从四十里地以外叫到县里去“训斥”了一顿（孟向县委宣传部这样反映，民政科不承认曾“训”斥过他）。报纸上批评了灵正渠的管理上官僚主义，四次放水淹地四百亩后，渠道管理委员会的负责同志，长时期思想上搞不通。有的还说：“有错，县委该当面指出来，何必登报！？”
    四、对违反政策的现象熟视无睹。四月间，据华北局党校学员反映：灵寿一区群众中流传着：“三、五年恢复农业生产，十年八年恢复工业生产，以后还闹平分”等错误说法，有的群众甚至卖掉土改中分得的土地房屋。地委曾责成灵寿县委调查研究这一情况。但县委对此问题却并不重视。
    上述现象产生的原因有三：一、某些县委领导机关对党中央关于在报刊上展开批评与自我批评的决定，重视不够，未认真学习，或者是学习得很浮浅，没有联系实际，深入检查工作。因而有些领导机关害怕批评，封锁通讯干事和通讯员，在被批评后也不进行检讨。二、有些县委领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风，把自己陷于忙碌的事务圈子里，很少集中力量考虑党的政策和群众利益问题，很多有关政策和群众生活的重大问题，被他们看成是私人小事而抛置不理。三、县领导上没有健全的检查机构和检查制度。大部县份未设检查秘书，无专人负检查工作的责任。
    为了克服这种官僚主义作风，石家庄地委指示各县县委：未设检查秘书的应速设检查秘书，树立检查工作制度。检查秘书应随时记载报纸提出的批评、地委指定检查的事件、本县发觉尚未解决的重要问题等，督促被批评者作检讨，问题严重者提请县委指派专人或组织检查组进行检查处理，并组织下乡干部搜集汇报，检查结果，在报纸上公布。
    编者按：石家庄地委重视报纸批评的精神，是很正确的，但是设立“检查秘书”的方法，则是不够的。因为党中央关于在报纸、刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定中规定，批评在报纸刊物上发表后，“如被批评者拒绝表示态度，或对批评者加以打击，即应由党的纪律检查委员会予以处理。上述情事触犯行政法律的部分，应由国家监察机关司法机关予以处理。”又党中央已规定各级纪律检查委员会必须设置一定的工作机关。因而我们认为不必再为处理批评问题而专设检查秘书，应将这些工作交给党的纪律检查委员会和政府的监察机关和司法机关处理。
