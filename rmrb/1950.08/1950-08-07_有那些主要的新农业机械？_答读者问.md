　　Recently, many readers have written to inquire about the types, structures, and effectiveness of new agricultural machinery. Now, the Mechanized Farming School of the Ministry of Agriculture has selected several major machines and provides brief answers as follows (for detailed introductions, you can contact the school directly):

　　(1) Five-Bottom Plow: The total width is 175 centimeters. The depth of plowing can be adjusted arbitrarily from 3 or 4 inches to 1 foot. The driver can control the raising and lowering of the plow from the tractor. There is also a balance adjustment device to ensure that the plowing depth of all five bottoms is the same. It can plow 120 to 150 mu of land every 10 hours.

　　(2) Forty-One Disc Harrow: Consists of a total of forty-one discs, divided into front and rear rows. Used for harrowing the land and breaking up the soil. The angle of the discs can be adjusted according to the depth of harrowing. It can harrow 150 to 200 mu of land every 10 hours.

　　(3) Twenty-Four Row Seeder: The row spacing is 15 centimeters. Each row has a disc opener, and seeds fall into the furrow from the seed box through the seed delivery tube, followed by a soil covering ring to cover the seeds. If a wider row spacing is required, seeds can be sown every other row or every two rows. It can sow 200 mu every 10 hours.

　　(4) Cultivator: The total width is 450 centimeters. The depth of cultivation and the size of the row spacing can be adjusted arbitrarily (depending on the size of the crop row spacing and the extent of root distribution on the ground). The cultivator teeth are divided into four types: spring cultivator teeth, deep cultivator teeth, wing-shaped cultivator teeth, and soil-covering blade-type cultivator teeth. It can cultivate 150 to 200 mu per hour.

　　(5) Automatic Combine Harvester: The combine harvester is a complex machine that performs both harvesting and threshing operations simultaneously. It can be roughly divided into three parts: cutting, threshing, and cleaning. After the crops are cut by the cutter, they are sent to the threshing cylinder for threshing. The threshed seeds are transported to the seed box through a sieve plate and fan blowing. Stalks and weeds are discharged from the rear through the stalk sieve. The cutter width is 400 centimeters, and it can harvest 150 to 200 mu per hour.

　　(6) Tractor-Pulled Combine Harvester: Equipped with its own engine, but only responsible for harvesting and threshing. It must be driven by a tractor during operation. The internal structure is roughly the same as the automatic type, but the cleaning part has two layers. The threshed seeds go through the first cleaning sieve and then to the second cleaning sieve, so it is cleaner than the automatic type. The cutter width is 490 centimeters, and it can harvest 200 to 300 mu every 10 hours.

　　(7) Stalin 80 Diesel Tractor: Equipped with an 80-horsepower engine, powered by diesel. It also has a twin-cylinder small gasoline starting engine, making starting quite convenient. When plowing, it can pull three five-bottom plows, plowing 300 to 400 mu every 10 hours; when harrowing, it can pull four forty-one disc harrows, harrowing 600 to 800 mu every 10 hours; when sowing, it can pull six twenty-four row seeders, sowing 1,200 mu every 10 hours. It uses only 4 to 5 gallons of diesel per hour, which is amazingly efficient and extremely economical.

　　有那些主要的新农业机械？  答读者问
    最近有许多读者来函询问新农业机械种类、构造及其效能等问题。现经农业部机耕学校择主要的几种机械，简复于下（如需要详细介绍，可去该校直接连系）：
    （一）五铧犁：共宽一七五公分。耕地深浅可从三、四寸到一尺随意调整。驾驶员在拖拉机上可操纵犁的升降。另有平衡调整装置，使五个犁铧耕深程度相同。每十小时可耕地一百二十亩至一百五十亩。
    （二）四十一片圆盘耙：共四十一个圆盘，分前后两列。用以耙地碎土。圆盘角度可随耙地深浅予以调整。每十小时可耙地一百五十亩至二百亩。
    （三）二十四行播种机：行间距离十五公分，每行间有圆盘开沟器，种子从种子箱内顺输种管落入沟内，随后有复土环将种子盖好。如每行距离需要宽时，可每隔一行或两行播种。每十小时可播二百亩。
    （四）中耕机：共宽四百五十公分。中耕深浅，行距大小可随意调整（视作物行距大小发根散布地面多少而定）。锄齿分为弹簧锄齿、深耕锄齿、翼形锄齿、复土板型锄齿四种。每小时可中耕一百五十亩至二百亩。
    （五）自动联合收获机：联合收获机是同时作收割和脱粒工作的复杂机械。大致可分为剪割、脱粒、清选三部分。农作物被剪刀割下之后，即送入脱粒滚筒处脱粒。被脱粒的种子经过筛板、风扇吹扬而输送到种子箱内。蒿草则经蒿杆筛从后部落出。割刀宽四百公分，每小时可收获一百五十亩至二百亩。
    （六）拖拉联合收获机：本身装有引擎，但只管收获和脱粒工作。行走时须用拖拉机带动。内部构造大致与自动式相同，不过清选部分有两层，被脱粒的种子经过第一次清选筛后，再到第二清选筛，故较自动式为干净。割刀宽四百九十公分，每十小时收获二百亩至三百亩。
    （七）斯大林八十号柴油拖拉机：装有八十匹马力引擎，用柴油发动。另有一双缸小汽油起动引擎，故发动颇为方便。犁地时，可拖动三个五铧犁，每十小时犁地三百至四百亩；耙地时可拖四个四十一片圆盘耙，每十小时耙地六百至八百亩；播种时可拖六个二十四行播种机，每十小时可播种一千二百亩。每小时仅用柴油四至五加仑，效力惊人，且极经济。
