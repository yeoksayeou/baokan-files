Fengnan County Grain Depot's Poor Storage Practices Result in Overheating of 240,000 Jin of Red Grain

To the Editor:

Fengnan County, Hebei Province, lacks a sense of responsibility in grain storage work, resulting in the overheating of 240,000 jin of red grain.

On June 21st, the county's grain distribution depot received 240,000 jin of red grain shipped from the Northeast Grain Company. Because the grain was exposed to rain during transportation and became damp, it should not have been put into storage. However, the depot's staff simply stored this damp grain in a large warehouse and considered the matter settled.

On June 29th, an inspection was carried out and it was found that the warehouse temperature was only 25 degrees Celsius, while the grain temperature had reached 27 degrees Celsius. The quality of the grain had already begun to change. However, the depot manager still adopted a laissez-faire attitude. On July 3rd, another inspection revealed that the grain was overheating, but the grain manager believed that the weather was bad and that it could not be turned over and dried; it could wait for a sunny day. He also did not report the overheating of the grain to the depot director, and the leadership did not personally inspect it. It was not until the 5th, when news of spoiled grain elsewhere was heard, that attention was drawn to the matter. After the person in charge of the depot personally inspected it, it was discovered that 40,000 jin of the 240,000 jin of grain in the entire depot had turned gray and developed white mold. The remaining 200,000 jin was overheating. The depot then immediately transferred the grain to allow for ventilation in the drizzling rain, saving the grain from becoming moldy and rotten.

An investigation into the cause of this grain overheating revealed that the county government and the depot leadership did not adequately inspect the grain. For example, the person in charge of the county government only verbally urged the strengthening of grain depot management work in the past, but in practice, not only did they not inspect the grain, but they also did not ask the depot manager about the results of the grain inspection. This is an irresponsible, bureaucratic style of work towards state property, and should be reviewed and corrected.

### 丰南县粮库保管工作差  二十四万斤红粮发热

　　丰南县粮库保管工作差
    二十四万斤红粮发热编者同志：
    河北省丰南县在保管粮食工作上缺乏责任心，致二十四万斤红粮发热。
    该县粮食分库于六月二十一日接收东北粮食公司运来红粮二十四万斤，因在运输途中遇雨，粮食受潮，本来不能入库。而该库工作同志，将这些受潮粮食存到一个大库房里，就万事大吉了。
    六月二十九日进行了检查，发现仓库温度仅二十五度，而粮食温度则达到二十七度。粮质已起变化。但管库员仍然采取听之任之的态度。七月三日再行检查，发觉粮食发热了，而管粮员却认为天气不好，不能翻晒，晴天再说。也没向库主任报告粮食发热的情况，领导上也没有亲自检查。直到五日听到别处坏粮的消息，才提起注意。经该库负责人亲自检查，发觉全库二十四万斤粮食，已有四万斤粮食发灰色，生白毛。二十万斤则已发热。便立刻在细雨中倒库出风，使粮食避免了霉坏。
    检查这次粮食发热的原因，是县政府及该库领导上，对粮食检查不够。如县政府负责人过去只是在口头上督促加强粮库管理工作，但在实际上不但未加检查，亦未追问管库员检查粮食的结果，这是对国家财产不负责任的官僚主义作风，应该加以检讨纠正。
