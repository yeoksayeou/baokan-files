　　Rectifying Ideological Style, Conducting Land Reform Education
    Changsha Prefecture Massively Trains Cadres in Rotation
    [Our Dispatch] Since late June, Changsha, Yueyang, Xiangyin and other eight counties under Hunan Province's Changsha Prefecture have successively held training classes, transferring and training key township-level cadres to rectify their ideological style and conduct education on land reform policies. These cadres are all activists who emerged in the movements of suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, and reducing rent; with the exception of a small number of middle peasants, the vast majority are poor peasants. They are generally very active in their work, but due to insufficient education, their class consciousness is not yet high, their sense of ownership has not yet been established, and they do not yet fully understand policies and laws. The training mainly involves checking the rent reduction movement and spring plowing production work, and conducting discussions in connection with their ideology, stance, work style, and policy implementation. The training classes are led by county-level responsible cadres, with district-level cadres participating to promote learning. On the one hand, the achievements and advantages in the work are correctly assessed, and on the other hand, the shortcomings and biases are pointed out, the good are commended, and the bad are criticized, in order to raise the class consciousness of the trainees and firm up their stance. Many cadres in the study reviewed their undesirable ideological styles such as coercion and commandism and selfishness, boldly exposed their shortcomings, and launched criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, they studied land reform policies, and everyone felt that they had gained a lot. According to the plan of Changsha Prefecture, a large number of people will be trained this time. For example, Changsha County has 330 townships, and at three people per township (township head, farmers' association director, militia captain), a total of 1,000 people need to be trained. In the first phase, the counties trained a total of 1,580 people, with a training period of seven days to half a month. Some counties have completed the first phase of training. (Wang Bin)

　　整顿思想作风·进行土改教育
    长沙专区大量轮训干部
    【本报讯】湖南省长沙专区所属长沙、岳阳、湘阴等八县，六月下旬起先后举办了训练班，调训乡级主要干部，以整顿思想作风，并进行土地改革政策教育。这些干部都是在剿匪、反霸、减租运动中涌现的积极分子，除少数中农外，绝大部分是贫农。他们在工作中一般都很积极，但因教育不够，阶级觉悟还不高，主人翁的思想尚未建立，对政策法令还不够了解。训练中主要是通过检查减租运动及春耕生产工作，并联系思想、立场、作风和执行政策的情形进行讨论。训练班由县级负责干部掌握，区级干部参加推动学习。一面正确地估计工作中的成绩和优点，一面指出缺点及偏向，表扬好的，批评坏的，以提高学员阶级觉悟，坚定立场。许多干部在学习中检讨了强迫命令和自私自利等不良的思想作风，大胆地暴露了缺点，展开了批评与自我批评。同时学习了土地改革政策，大家都感到收获很大。按长沙专区此次计划训练的人数很多，如长沙县有三百三十个乡，以每乡三人计（乡长、农协主任、民兵队长），共需训练一千人。各县第一期共训练了一千五百八十人，训练期限为七天至半月。有的县第一期已训练完毕。（王斌）
