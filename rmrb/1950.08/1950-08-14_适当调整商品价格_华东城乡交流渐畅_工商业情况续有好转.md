Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th: For more than two months, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in East China has become increasingly smooth, and the situation of private businesses has begun to improve. This is a result of the state-owned trading agencies in various regions implementing the instructions of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government in adjusting industry and commerce and tax revenue, and appropriately adjusting the price differences between wholesale and retail, between regions, and between industrial and agricultural products.

Since the stabilization of prices nationwide in March of this year, false purchasing power suddenly disappeared, and a large amount of commodities accumulated in cities were dumped, causing abnormal market prices for a time. First, there was a price inversion between production areas and sales areas, such as the price of cotton yarn in various production areas being higher than in sales areas. Second, the price difference between retail and wholesale was very small, or even non-existent. For example, in May, the price difference between Shanghai's rice, yarn, cloth, cooking oil, and salt was less than 2.5%; in Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places, the difference between the retail and wholesale prices of yarn and cloth was almost non-existent. On the other hand, during periods of larger price declines, merchants were eager to sell goods, and the market price appeared lower than the price of state-owned specialized companies.

In early June, state-owned specialized companies in East China followed the order of the Central Trade Department and made preliminary adjustments in a step-by-step manner, based on the principle of "benefiting all three parties." As a result, the price difference between wholesale and retail of major commodities such as grain, yarn, cloth, oil, salt, and sugar has now reached an average of about 4 to 10%, and department stores are around 6 to 20%. Retailers and transporters can earn profits of approximately 2 to 10%. This greatly facilitates the normal exchange between industrial and agricultural products, the volume of market transactions has begun to increase significantly, and the enthusiasm of private merchants has also greatly increased. According to statistics from the East China Branch of the People's Bank of China, the Shanghai railway and waterway freight indices increased from 94.7 and 65.5 in May (with December of last year as 100) to 104.8 and 190.2 in June, respectively. The increase in waterway freight is particularly obvious. The average total transport volume in the first week of July increased by 140% compared to the average of each week in June, and by 629% compared to May. The Shanghai main commodity turnover index (based on December of last year as 100) was only 36.9 in April, 40.6 in May, and increased to 54.1 in the second week of June, and 50.7 in the first week of July, an increase of about 25% compared to May. The amount of check clearing and remittances generated by commodity trading and urban-rural exchanges has also increased significantly. Check clearing in the second week of July (10th to 15th) increased by 69% compared to the average index in May, and remittance inflows in the first week of July increased by 42% compared to the first week of June, while outflows increased by 55%. In the grain markets of various regions, the trading volume in June and the first half of July generally increased by 20% to 30% compared to May. Shanghai's total grain turnover in June was 220,000 shi, an increase of 31% compared to May, and the turnover in the first half of July has also reached 48% of the total amount for the entire month of June; the proportion of private merchants has expanded from 34% in May to 62%. In Wuxi, merchants transported twice as much rice back from Hankou, Jiangxi, and Anhui in June compared to May. The situation in the yarn, cloth, and daily necessities markets is similar.

With the improvement of the industrial and commercial situation, the number of shops requesting to open or resume business in major cities in East China has also increased month by month. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, 142 applications to resume business were made in Shanghai in June, an increase of six and a half times compared to May (22 applications). There were 48 applications in the first ten days of July, an increase of 1% compared to the average number of applications in each ten-day period in June. The number of applications to open stores also jumped from 26 in May to 128 in June. The number of households applying to close down in June decreased by 73% compared to May. From April to June, 31 commercial establishments engaged in urban-rural exchange businesses such as transportation, cotton cloth, grain, and daily necessities applied to open or resume business and were approved. The number of applications to open or resume business in Jinan and other places in June also increased by 13% compared to May.

Before and after the price adjustments, state-owned specialized companies in Shanghai, Wuxi, Jinan, Bengbu, Yangzhou, and other places actively publicized and explained the price policies of the Central People's Government to the business community, consulted with industry and commerce on the proportion of adjustments, strengthened the ties between public and private sectors, and smoothly implemented the price adjustment policy. However, due to insufficient prior investigation and research, individual regions experienced a tendency to raise prices too high or in excessively large increments for certain commodities. In addition, the East China Branch of China Coal Industry Company did not promptly implement the order of the East China Trade Department and did not begin to adjust the retail and wholesale price difference of coal until mid-July, which was also a major shortcoming.

Currently, the specialized companies in East China are closely monitoring the reasonable prices of agricultural products (especially wheat and new grain) and further adjusting the price differences between regions, retail, and wholesale in a reasonable manner.

### 适当调整商品价格  华东城乡交流渐畅  工商业情况续有好转

　　适当调整商品价格
    华东城乡交流渐畅
    工商业情况续有好转
    【新华社上海十一日电】两个多月以来，华东地区城乡物资交流日益畅旺，私营商业情况已开始好转。这是各地国营贸易机关在调整工商业与调整税收工作中执行中央人民政府贸易部的指示，适当调整了批发与零售、地区与地区间及工农业之产品间差价的结果。
    自今年三月全国物价稳定以后，虚假购买力突然消失，城市中囤积的商品大量抛出，市场物价曾一度出现不正常的现象。首先是产地与销地间的价格倒挂，如各地棉纱在产地的价格高于销地。其次是零售与批发间的差价很小，甚至没有差价。如五月份上海的大米、纱、布、食油、食盐等差价都在百分之二点五以下；杭州、南京、无锡等地的纱、布零售与批发价之间则几乎毫无差额。另一方面，在物价降落幅度较大时期，商人急于售货，又出现了市价低于国营专业公司牌价的现象。
    华东国营各专业公司六月初按照中央贸易部命令，以“三方面有利”的原则，分别地有步骤地作了初步调整。因此，目前粮食、纱、布、油、盐、糖等主要商品的批发与零售间的差价，平均已达到百分之四到十左右，百货类在百分之六到二十左右。零售商与贩运商约可获利百分之二至十不等。这样就大为有利于工、农业产品间的正常交换，市场交易量开始显著增加，私商经营积极性也大为提高。据人民银行华东区行统计：上海铁路与水路货运指数分别从五月份的九十四点七和六十五点五（以去年十二月为一百），增至六月份的一百零四点八和一百九十点二。其中水路货运的增加尤为明显，七月第一周较六月份各周平均运输总量增加百分之一百四十，较五月份则增加百分之六百二十九。上海主要商品成交量指数（以去年十二月为基期——一百），四月份仅为三十六点九，五月份为四十点六，六月份第二周曾增至五十四点一，七月第一周为五十点七，较五月份约增百分之二十五。因商品交易和城乡交流行为而发生的票据交换金额和汇款额，亦有显著增加。票据交换，七月第二周（十日至十五日）较五月份平均指数增加百分之六十九，七月第一周汇入款额较六月第一周增加百分之四十二，汇出增加百分之五十五。各地粮食市场：六月份及七月上半月的成交量，较五月份普遍增加百分之二十至三十，上海六月份粮食总成交量二十二万石，较五月增加百分之三十一，七月上半月的成交量也已达六月全月总数的百分之四十八；其中私商经营的比例，已由五月份的百分之三十四扩大为百分之六十二。无锡市六月份商人去汉口、江西、安徽三地贩回的大米比五月份增加了两倍。纱布及百货日用品市场的情况亦与此相似。
    随着工商业情况的趋于好转，华东各大城市要求开业复业的商店也逐月增加。据上海市工商局统计：上海商业申请复业的，六月份一百四十二件，较五月份（二十二件）增加六倍半，七月上旬为四十八件，较六月份各旬平均数又增加了百分之一；申请开业的商店亦自五月份的二十六家跃至六月份的一百二十八家。申请歇业户，六月份较五月份减少了百分之七十三。自四月至六月，经营有关城乡交流业务的商业如交通运输、棉布、粮食、日用品等业，申请开业复业并经核准的已达三十一户。六月份济南等地申请开业复业的也较五月份增加了百分之十三。
    在调整价格前后，上海、无锡、济南、蚌埠、扬州等地的国营专业公司，曾主动向商业界宣传和解释中央人民政府的物价政策，与工商界协商调整的比例，密切了公私之间的联系，顺利地贯彻执行了调整价格的政策。但是，由于事先调查研究不够，个别地区也曾发生对若干商品提价过高或提升幅度过大的偏向。另如中国煤业公司华东区公司没有及时执行华东贸易部命令，迟至七月中旬才开始调整煤的零售与批发差价，也是一个很大的缺点。
    目前华东区各专业公司正在密切注意农产物（尤其是小麦和新谷）的合理价格的掌握，以及地区与地区、零售与批发间差价的进一步的合理调整。
