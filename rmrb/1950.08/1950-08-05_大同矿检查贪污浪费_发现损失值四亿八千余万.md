　　Datong Mining Area, in conjunction with clearing materials and contributing equipment, launched a mass movement to inspect corruption and waste. From early May to mid-June, 42 cases of corruption and waste were exposed and confirmed, totaling 480 million yuan in value. The main waste in production lies in the lack of planning by leading cadres, the unreasonable organization of labor, and the significant consumption and loss of materials. The most serious case was the Tongjialiang Mine, which had more than 400 workers doing an average of seven hours of work per day, wasting 15,200 man-days per year, equivalent to 228,000 jin of millet. The reasons for the above phenomena are mainly the serious bureaucratic style of the leading cadres, the lax management system, and the unclear idea of relying on the working class. Therefore, they were not clear-headed about the old institutions and old systems they inherited, and they did not unite and educate the retained old personnel enough; coupled with the lack of criticism and self-criticism within the Party, this left loopholes for bad elements to exploit. In order to thoroughly overcome the above shortcomings, the Datong Mining Area Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued an instruction to "Carry out criticism and self-criticism, deeply examine work style, and launch a campaign against bureaucracy, corruption, and waste."

　　大同矿检查贪污浪费
    发现损失值四亿八千余万
    【本报大同讯】大同矿区结合着清理物资和献交器材，发动了群众性的检查贪污浪费运动。从五月上旬至六月中，经揭发并证实的贪污浪费案有四十二件，总值四亿八千余万元。生产中的主要浪费，在于领导干部缺乏计划性，劳力组织不合理和工料上的重大消耗与损失。最严重的为同家梁矿，该矿有四百余工人，每天平均做工七小时，一年即浪费人工一万五千二百个，共值小米二十二万八千斤。产生以上现象的原因，主要是领导干部存在着严重的官僚主义作风，管理制度不严格，依靠工人阶级的思想不明确。因此对接收的旧机构和旧制度不清醒，对留用的旧人员团结教育不够；加以党内缺乏批评和自我批评，就给坏分子留下了可钻的空子。为彻底克服上述缺点，中共大同矿区分委已发出“开展批评与自我批评，深入检查作风，开展反官僚主义与贪污浪费运动”的指示。（大同矿区工人报）
