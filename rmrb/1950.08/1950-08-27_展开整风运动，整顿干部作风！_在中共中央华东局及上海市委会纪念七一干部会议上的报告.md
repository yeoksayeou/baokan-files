Comrades!

The Communist Party of China has been established for twenty-nine years today. For the past twenty-nine years, our Party has led the people of the whole country in a hard and arduous struggle against powerful enemies at home and abroad—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—and finally won a great and historically significant victory, becoming the founder and leader of the great People's Republic of China. Therefore, we feel particularly excited and happy today as we celebrate the Party's birthday.

After the victory of the revolutionary war, the central task placed before our Party and the people of the whole country today, as pointed out by Chairman Mao in his report to the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, is to strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation. It must be recognized that this is a task as arduous as striving for victory in the war. Therefore, in order to smoothly complete this new task, our Party must, after victory, promptly rectify and strengthen our ranks, rectify and improve the work style of our cadres, so as to further strengthen the ties between our Party and the masses, better unite the people of the whole country, and fight for the complete elimination of the enemy's remaining forces and the great victory on the economic front. The reason why the Party Central Committee decided to carry out a Party-wide rectification this summer, autumn, and winter, starting with the rectification of the cadre work style, lies in this.

We have already had a special briefing on the spirit and resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of our Party and Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session. Today, I will talk about the issue of rectifying the Party's work style.

I. Basic Situation of the Party in the East China Region in the Past Year

In terms of the Party's internal situation in the East China region, in the past year since crossing the Yangtze River, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have completed many glorious tasks together with the people of East China: We liberated the entire mainland of East China and basically eliminated the bandit activities within the territory except for some areas in Fujian and Zhejiang; we completed the takeover of the vast new urban and rural areas and initially transformed the grassroots political power in the new areas, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship; we completed and are continuing to complete the arduous tasks of public grain, taxation, and supporting the front, and basically overcame the serious disaster last year that affected four provinces and regions and 16 million people; we organized the broad masses of workers, peasants, women, young intellectuals, and other working people, and further improved their political and cultural level; we made great efforts to smash the enemy's blockade and bombing, and overcame many difficulties in financial and economic work. All these and other achievements and victories are inseparable from the selfless efforts of all our cadres and Party members. We in East China today have more than 400,000 cadres and 1.63 million Party members. The vast majority of them are good and wholeheartedly serve the people. Thousands upon thousands of our cadres and Party members have heroically sacrificed themselves in the battle and work posts, and many comrades have become ill due to overwork. This spirit of self-sacrifice for the revolution is worthy of learning and praise by the whole Party. It should be pointed out that this is the main and basic aspect of the Party's situation in our East China region.

However, on the other hand, due to our rapid development of victory, the vastness of the newly liberated areas, the extremely complex environment, the extremely arduous tasks, the small number of old and experienced cadres, the large number of new cadres absorbed, and the lack of time for systematic education and transformation, coupled with the fact that the leadership of the East China Bureau still has some shortcomings during this period, many shortcomings and mistakes have occurred in the work along with the victories and achievements; the most important of these are the bureaucratic and commandist work styles, and the arrogant and complacent attitude of some cadres who consider themselves as heroes.

Comrades! Our achievements and efforts have been praised and thanked by the broad masses of the people, and we must continue to work hard and carry them forward. However, the shortcomings and mistakes in our work have also aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses and caused losses in the work. Therefore, we must resolutely overcome and correct them. Below, I will expose the bureaucratic and commandist work styles and the arrogant and complacent attitude of some cadres who consider themselves as heroes based on some facts. However, the examples I cited here may not be complete. Therefore, my report today is only a beginning, and its purpose is to arouse the vigilance, review, and correction of the comrades.

II. Opposing Bureaucracy in Leadership Work

The bureaucratic work style of being divorced from the masses and reality exists in varying degrees in some of our leading organs and some work departments in various forms. Because bureaucracy is a reflection of the ideological and work style of the old and declining ruling class, its harm is particularly great. In a sense, it is a breeding ground for the growth and development of various undesirable tendencies. Therefore, we must resolutely overcome bureaucracy in leadership work in order to effectively overcome commandism and other undesirable tendencies in work. Now I will analyze the various manifestations of bureaucracy in our work.

One manifestation of bureaucracy is being high above, divorced from reality; that is, when stipulating work tasks and work plans, or when implementing the work tasks and work plans stipulated by the higher authorities, not proceeding from objective reality, but from subjective wishes; at the same time, after the plan is stipulated, it is considered that everything is going well, and no regular, systematic, and serious inspection work is carried out. Being careless, self-righteous, and lacking a high sense of responsibility for the people's cause are the characteristics of this kind of bureaucracy. Unfortunately, we have many examples of this.

Let me take the shipbuilding plan of the Shanghai Maritime Bureau as an example. After the liberation of Shanghai last year, due to the heavy tasks of coal and grain transportation and supporting the front, it was felt that there was a shortage of ships for a time. With the approval of the higher authorities, the Maritime Bureau built a large number of various ships in Shanghai, with a construction cost of more than 100 million catties of grain, which was a considerable scale. As of May this year, 195 ships have been built. Now, according to the inspection by the Ministry of Transportation, there is serious bureaucracy in this work. First of all, when formulating this shipbuilding plan, there was no good understanding of the actual situation of the ships in Shanghai at that time. Secondly, because the leaders did not understand the shipbuilding business, blindly trusted the retained personnel, and were careless in their work, there was a lack of detailed and thorough plans in advance, and no in-depth inspection work was carried out afterwards, so that most of the ships built did not meet the standards. Among the 195 ships, the performance of the ships built by various factories was inconsistent. Some leaked water, some consumed too much fuel, some could not pass through inland river bridges due to the high installation of the driving room, and some vibrated violently when starting due to the mismatch between the machine and the hull, affecting the life of the ships. In addition to these engineering defects, the waste of other materials was also serious.

Let's take a look at the examples of our allocation and storage of public grain. In order to stabilize prices and ensure the supply of grain to Shanghai and the disaster areas in East China, the Central Financial and Economic Commission once carried out a large-scale grain transfer across the country. This measure was completely correct and necessary. This measure played a huge role not only in ensuring the grain supply in East China but also in stabilizing prices across the country. At the same time, the East China Branch of the China National Grain Corporation also achieved success in carrying out this task. However, unfortunately, the East China Branch of the China National Grain Corporation also made careless and bureaucratic mistakes in organizing and leading this huge work. The most important of these was that it did not conduct in-depth investigation and research on the capacity, conditions, and other circumstances of various warehouses in Shanghai in advance, and did not estimate the quantity that could be stored based on the actual situation, and quickly reported it to the higher authorities so that the higher authorities could stop transporting too much grain to Shanghai in time; instead, it blindly accepted the transportation based only on subjective wishes, so that it was finally found that many warehouse facilities did not meet the grain storage standards, and the stacking of grain also greatly exceeded the limit. In addition, the nature of the grain transported and the moisture content were not tested in advance, and no inspection was carried out after entering the warehouse, so that by mid-April this year, a large amount of grain in the warehouse was heating up. At that time, the grain in stock in Shanghai was more than 460 million catties, and more than 144 million catties were heating up, accounting for about 31% of the total grain in stock; the grain heating up in individual warehouses reached 60% of the total, and generally it was close to the danger of discoloration and deterioration. Only then did they hurriedly organize rescue and actively protect the grain. Although most of the grain was saved after the rescue, the losses suffered by the people's national property were great.

Here, we must also point out another typical bureaucracy, that is, the bureaucracy of "being full and doing nothing all day long." Although this extremely bad bureaucratic work style is not very common in our ranks, this phenomenon still exists, so it is worth our vigilance. For example, due to the irresponsibility of the leaders of the Shanghai Petroleum Company, since August last year, the gasoline lost due to the sinking of oil tankers and theft has reached more than 184,600 liters. When the serious situation had been discovered one after another, the leaders of the company still did not immediately conduct a strict review, investigate the responsibility, and study ways to overcome it, but only used the report of the director of the Gaoqiao Oil Depot that "it may have been stolen" to perfunctorily deal with it. What an irresponsible attitude this is! No wonder the company successively experienced fire and explosion accidents in oil pools and oil tankers in February and March this year. We must make those who are irresponsible to the people's cause and national property bear the necessary responsibility for the national losses.

Another manifestation of bureaucracy is that there is no central point in the work, and one is not good at relying on the masses. One is trapped in the busyness of pragmatism all day long, or busy with the empty shouting of commandism. That is, "hard-working bureaucracy" or "vigorous bureaucracy." It is different from the bureaucracy of "being full and doing nothing all day long." The characteristic of this kind of bureaucrat is that he subjectively really wants to do a good job, is loyal and courageous, and does not avoid hard work. They either work like a donkey pushing a mill every day, or they run around like ants on a hot pot, and get burned out. But the result is that the effort is not rewarded, and it is "grabbing sesame seeds and losing watermelon." Why is this so? The main reasons are: First, they made mistakes of subjectivism or egalitarianism in their thinking methods, and did not understand the difference between the urgency of things, the main and the secondary; did not understand grasping the most central link and concentrating the main forces to attack this central link, so that other secondary links could be solved easily. Instead, they were trivial and busy with the pragmatic response; or they were simply and carelessly busy with empty shouting, thus forming a kind of leadership without a clue. Second, they are not good at following the mass line, not good at leading, organizing, and promoting organizations, not good at adopting scientific division of labor leadership methods and working methods, and there is no combination of leadership and the masses, but a separation of leadership and the masses. Such leadership is of course impossible to do a good job. However, this phenomenon is quite common in East China.

Another manifestation of bureaucracy is formalism and red tape. That is, there are many meetings, many documents, overlapping organizations, and cumbersome procedures. Certain meetings are necessary and indispensable; but meetings must have content and preparation. Each meeting should solve one or several problems. Such meetings are necessary for understanding the situation, summing up experience, promoting work, and educating cadres. However, many of our meetings are formalistic. The more meetings there are, the more difficult it is to deepen the work. Cadres with many concurrent positions spend all day attending meetings and have little time to do practical work. For example, the chairman of the trade union of the Ninth Textile Factory has to attend more than 50 meetings in a month. Similarly, certain documents are also necessary and indispensable. However, plans, instructions, resolutions, forms, etc. must be able to truly play a role in guiding and promoting the work, so we should pay attention to quality rather than quantity. However, many of our documents and forms are boilerplate articles that do not meet the actual needs. For example, Wujiang County in Southern Jiangsu received a total of 127 documents from the county party committee and 717 documents from the county government from January to April. May I ask what better results can be achieved by so many documents other than disrupting the work below? Furthermore, in terms of overlapping organizations and cumbersome procedures, this is a manifestation of formalism and red tape that has moved the official procedures of the Kuomintang bureaucratic organs into our work. To give an example: A citizen of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau applied for the installation of a telephone, and it took 48 procedures and delayed it for eight and a half months before the telephone was installed. This kind of "kicking the ball back and forth" and "official document travel" is the basic reason for the slow handling of bureaucratic affairs.

In addition, there is a kind of bureaucracy that is manifested in loving to report good news, fearing to report bad news, and being afraid of criticism and suppressing criticism. Some of our leading organs and leading cadres lack a democratic spirit and a humble attitude of learning, and are often arrogant and intimidating. They only like praise and are afraid of criticism; as soon as they hear criticism, they immediately turn angry and reject people thousands of miles away, and even take retaliatory measures. This kind of self-imposed isolation and bureaucracy that is divorced from the masses only invisibly draws a gap between the leaders and the led, and between the Party members and the masses, creating a state of disconnection between the top and bottom, and disharmony between the inside and outside. For example, in May this year, the Shanghai News Daily published articles criticizing the enterprises and institutions under the East China Trade Department. The Shanghai News Daily's enthusiasm for caring for the trade institutions of the People's Government was originally worthy of gratitude. However, a certain person in charge of one of the criticized enterprises—the department store—lacked the spirit of humbly accepting criticism, and instead seized on individual words and argued with the interviewing director of the Shanghai News Daily, insisting that the newspaper make corrections. After repeated negotiations, he began to conduct a review. As another example, the social service column of the Northern Anhui Daily received 328 criticisms of Party and government organs and cadres throughout the year, but more than 80% of them did not receive the necessary response. This attitude of ignoring mass criticism, or restricting its publication, or attacking and retaliating against critics is obviously incompatible with the Central Committee's decision to launch criticism and self-criticism of all our errors and shortcomings in all public occasions, among the people, especially in newspapers and periodicals. Only by overcoming this bureaucracy of "deep closure and refusal" can our Party's and the people's construction cause advance by leaps and bounds.

The above are the main forms of bureaucracy manifested by some of our leading organs and work departments. Below, I will also talk about commandism in our work execution.

III. Correcting Commandism in Work

Commandism is essentially a concrete manifestation of bureaucracy in work execution, and a reflection of the work style of the exploiting class and the oppressing class ruling the people in our revolutionary ranks. After we entered the new areas, due to the complexity of the environment, the arduousness of the tasks, and the large increase in new components, it was easier for this Kuomintang ruling work style to be infected. Because commandism is something that directly meets the masses, the masses' resentment towards it is the deepest, and its harm to the relationship between our Party and the masses is particularly great. It has built a high wall between our Party and the broad masses, making the masses unable to see the correct face of our Party's policies and only see the incorrect work style of the cadres' commandism and unreasonableness. Therefore, if we do not resolutely overcome commandism, we will inevitably separate our Party from the masses, and the people's revolutionary cause will suffer serious losses.

First of all, let us take a look at the specific manifestations of commandism in financial and grain work! It is very clear that our financial and grain work is "taken from the people and used for the people," which is fundamentally different from the Kuomintang's "taken from the people and used for oneself." Therefore, as long as we can repeatedly conduct propaganda and education to the people and explain this principle clearly, the broad masses of the people will support the government's public grain and taxation policies. Unfortunately, many of our staff do not understand this simple principle. As soon as the task comes, they resort to any means, copy the old methods of the Kuomintang, and adopt a work style of unreasonableness and coercion. For example, in the grain collection work in various provinces, serious phenomena such as increasing quotas at each level and random beating, random arrest, random fines, and even forcing people to death have occurred in many areas.

The above-mentioned similar situations have also occurred in tax collection and public debt work. When Shanghai conducted an inspection of the fourth phase of business tax, the tax cadres strongly investigated the accounts. Therefore, in order to complete the task, the auditors even deliberately found fault in the audit. When problems were found, the tax bureau sometimes imposed heavy fines without considering them. In the promotion of public debt, there are also cases of forcing the sale of public debt in a coercive manner. For example, in a city in Northern Jiangsu, Yangzhou, more than 20 businessmen were struggled because they could not pay the public debt.

In the rural leadership production and disaster relief movement, the phenomenon of cadres taking compulsory measures and being divorced from the masses is also not uncommon. Production and disaster relief work is clearly directly beneficial to the masses, and therefore it is easy to gain the support of the masses. However, in some places, the opposite is true, because our cadres do not understand relying on the masses, do not understand adopting the mass line, and do not understand discussing and consulting with the masses in everything, but instead adopt compulsory methods, resulting in the deterioration of things. For example, in the mobilization of the masses to repair dikes and prevent floods in the Baizhang District of Wujin County, due to the adoption of commandist methods such as forcing the masses to send laborers and hire laborers, the masses were incited by bandits and special agents, causing a riot of thousands of people.

The commandist work style is also seriously manifested in the cadres of public security work, which is worthy of the vigilance of the whole Party. Because the public security organs are one of the important tools for implementing the people's democratic dictatorship, on the one hand, they should resolutely implement the policy of suppression against domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries and bandits who endanger the interests of the people, and on the other hand, they should resolutely adopt the policy of protecting the interests and democratic rights of the people. This is the fundamental difference between the people's public security organs and the police stations of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Unfortunately, some staff of our people's public security departments, in the work of protecting the people's democratic rights and defending the people's interests, on the one hand, adopted unprincipled leniency towards heinous counter-revolutionaries, and on the other hand, committed serious commandism and random beating, random arrest, random fines, and even random killing errors in general ordinary cases. For example, according to a review by a branch bureau in Shanghai, 80% of the criminal police officers had beaten people; and according to a review by another branch bureau, 90% of the criminal offenders had been beaten. The situation of random beating, arrest, and fines in the public security organs in other regions is also serious. For example, in the ten counties of the Fuyang Special District in Northern Anhui, the directors of the public security bureaus of eight counties had personally beaten people. This phenomenon is very serious and must be corrected quickly. Only by thoroughly eliminating the past Kuomintang's rude and unreasonable, arbitrary and authoritarian, random beating, random arrest, random fines, and random killing bad work style can we avoid tarnishing the glorious title of the people's police—the protector of the people's interests!

In other various tasks, the commandist work style also exists in varying degrees. I hope that comrades in various places and various work departments will pay serious attention and conduct strict reviews.

Experience in various places has proved that wherever the commandist work style of cadres is particularly serious, the masses begin to leave us, our cadres gradually fall into isolation, our work is difficult to carry out, our difficulties become more and more serious, and bandits and reactionaries can take advantage of the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, sow discord, and even incite the masses to riot against us, causing serious losses to the country and the people. This painful experience and lesson must arouse the vigilance of the whole Party.

IV. Overcoming the Arrogant and Complacent Mood of Considering Oneself a Hero

Due to the basic victory of the Chinese revolution in the whole country, an arrogant and complacent mood of considering oneself a hero has emerged among individual Party members and cadres, and a mood of seeking enjoyment and not seeking progress has emerged. These comrades haggle over their personal status and treatment in their work, without considering their contribution and efforts to the Party and the people's cause. They look down on new Party members and new cadres, and look down on the masses and non-Party members. They despise Party discipline and government decrees.

Comrades who hold this wrong idea do not understand that today's victory of the revolution is primarily due to the greatness of the power of the people of the whole country and the correct leadership of our Party and Chairman Mao. Therefore, no individual should be arrogant and complacent. They do not understand that "seizing the victory of the whole country is only the first step in a long march," and "the road of revolution in the future is longer, the work is greater, and it is more arduous." Therefore, we must continue to be humble and prudent, better implement democratic cooperation with non-Party members, and continue to carry forward the work style of hard struggle in order to consolidate the current victory and achieve even greater victories in the future.

Comrades who are arrogant and complacent and do not seek progress must firmly remember this principle, that is, if we do not overcome the erroneous tendencies of closed-doorism and sectarianism, we will be in danger of being divorced from the masses and causing the failure of the people's revolutionary cause. If we do not overcome individualism and the ideas of corruption and degeneration, we will be in danger of falling out of the revolutionary ranks and eventually being abandoned by the people.

In general, the above-mentioned various bad work styles of bureaucracy and commandism, and the erroneous ideas of arrogance, complacency, and considering oneself a hero, although they absolutely cannot represent the ideology and work style of our Party, today in our Party in the East China region, they are no longer just individual phenomena, but rather widespread and serious phenomena. Therefore, we must arouse our special vigilance and attention. Therefore, we must, in accordance with the instructions and decisions of the Central Committee, quickly launch a rectification movement, and resolutely overcome the above-mentioned various bad work styles from the rectification movement.

V. Launch a Rectification Movement and March Forward Under the Victorious Banner of Mao Zedong!

Regarding how to launch the rectification movement in accordance with the principles of the Central Committee's rectification instructions and how to address the main shortcomings of the Party in the East China region, the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has already issued special instructions, so I will not repeat them here. I will only emphasize the following points here:

(1) This rectification is being carried out under the conditions that the revolutionary war has achieved rapid victory in the whole country. Due to the rapid victory of the revolutionary war in the whole country, the extremely heavy and complex tasks, and the large number of new cadres absorbed who have not yet had time for systematic education, the erroneous tendencies currently manifested in our Party, in terms of higher-level leading organs and leading cadres, are mainly bureaucracy; in terms of middle and lower-level work organs and work cadres, they are mainly commandism; in terms of some old cadres, they are mainly the growth of an emotion of considering themselves as heroes, arrogance, complacency, and not seeking progress; in terms of cooperation with non-Party members, they are mainly the tendency of closed-doorism that ignores the united front work. Therefore, the main task and purpose of this rectification is to overcome the bad work styles of bureaucracy, commandism, closed-doorism, and considering oneself a hero, arrogance, complacency, etc., that currently exist in the Party, in order to strengthen the connection between our Party and the masses of the urban and rural areas, consolidate the people's democratic united front, so as to smoothly carry out land reform work in the new rural areas, and the adjustment of industry and commerce work in the cities.

(2) The basic method of rectification should be to convene cadre rectification meetings or run rectification training classes level by level from top to bottom, and in the meetings or training classes, study Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC and other designated documents, summarize local work, and launch criticism and self-criticism. The basic link of the rectification is to closely combine the rectification movement with various work tasks. We should closely combine the study and research of documents and reports with the inspection of current practical work; we should closely combine the self-criticism from top to bottom with the review and criticism from bottom to top. However, the purpose of inspecting and summarizing past work is to correct past mistakes and improve future work, not to settle old scores. The focus of the rectification should be on cadres at all levels. Because rectifying the work style of responsible cadres first can not only deepen the rectification movement through them level by level, but also easily eliminate the concerns of general cadres about the rectification.

(3) All forms of rectification movement require sound organizational leadership. Whether it is a rectification meeting or a rectification training class, in the specific leadership, it is necessary to achieve the person in charge taking responsibility, doing it personally, and paying attention to combining the leading backbone with the masses to prevent substitution or laissez-faire.

Comrades! This large-scale rectification movement is a serious step in land reform and Party building. Whether the land reform that begins this winter can be completed smoothly, and whether some impure states that currently exist in our Party in terms of ideology and work style can be overcome smoothly, mainly depends on whether this rectification movement has achievements or the size of the achievements. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must strengthen the leadership of the rectification movement and must strive to ensure the smooth completion of the rectification tasks.

Comrades! Our achievements in the past year are great, but the shortcomings and mistakes in our work are indeed many. We should not be afraid to openly expose our shortcomings and mistakes, and we should resolutely correct our shortcomings and mistakes. Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese Communists, who take the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people as their starting point, believe that their cause is completely in line with justice, are willing to sacrifice everything of their own, and are always ready to give their lives to die for our cause. Do we still have any erroneous ideas, views, opinions, and methods that are not suitable for the needs of the people, and are reluctant to give up? Do we still welcome any political dust and political microorganisms to tarnish our clean face and erode our healthy body? Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, which makes each of us who are alive feel sad when we think of them. Do we still have any personal interests or mistakes and shortcomings that cannot be sacrificed?" (On Coalition Government)

Comrades! In the past, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, we united the people of the whole country, implemented the correct line and policies of the Party, learned the correct work style, and corrected various erroneous deviations. Therefore, we were able to defeat enemies at home and abroad and achieve today's great historical victory. In the future, under the victorious banner of Chairman Mao, we will continue to unite the people of the whole country, implement the correct line and policies of our Party, learn the correct work style, and resolutely correct various erroneous deviations. We will surely achieve a fundamental improvement in the national economic situation, and we will surely achieve a greater victory in building a new China!

　　展开整风运动，整顿干部作风！
    ——在中共中央华东局及上海市委会纪念七一干部会议上的报告
    饶漱石同志们！
    中国共产党成立到今天已经二十九周年了。二十九年以来，我们的党领导全国人民，与国内外强大的敌人——帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义——进行了艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于赢得了伟大的具有历史意义的胜利，成为伟大的中华人民共和国的建立者和领导者。因此，今天我们来庆祝党的生日，是特别感到兴奋和愉快的。
    在革命战争胜利后，今天放在我党与全国人民面前的中心任务，正如毛主席在党的七届三中全会报告中所指出，便是为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争。必须认识，这是一个与争取战争胜利同样艰巨的任务。因此，为了要顺利地完成这一新的任务，我们党就必须在胜利之后，及时地整顿与加强我们的队伍，整顿与改善干部的工作作风，以便更加密切我党与群众的联系，更好地团结全国人民，为彻底消灭敌人的残余势力及争取在经济战线上的伟大胜利而奋斗。我党中央决定要在今年夏秋冬三季来一次全党整风，而首先是整顿干部作风，其原因即在于此。
    关于我党七届三中全会的精神和决议，以及毛主席在三中全会上的报告，我们已经有了专门的传达。今天我就来谈一谈关于整顿党的工作作风问题。
    一、一年来华东地区党的基本情况
    就华东地区党内情况来说，渡江一年来，我们在党中央和毛主席的正确领导之下，曾经和华东人民一起，完成了许多光荣的任务：我们解放了整个华东大陆，并且基本上肃清了除闽浙部分地区以外境内的土匪活动；我们完成了对广大新区城乡的接管工作，并初步改造了新区的基层政权，巩固了人民民主专政；我们完成了和正在继续完成着公粮、税收、支前等项艰巨任务，并且基本上战胜了去年包括四个省区，一千六百万人口的严重灾荒；我们组织了广大的工人、农民、妇女、青年知识分子及其他劳动人民，并进一步提高了其政治文化水平；我们进行了粉碎敌人封锁轰炸的巨大努力，克服了许多财政经济工作中的困难。这一切以及其他的成绩和胜利，都是与我们全体干部和党员奋不顾身的努力分不开的。我们华东今天已有四十几万干部，一百六十三万党员。其中绝大部分都是好的，是忠心耿耿为人民服务的。我们已经有成千成万的干部和党员英勇地牺牲在战斗与工作的岗位上，还有许多的同志因公积劳成疾。这种为革命而自我牺牲的精神，是值得全党学习和表扬的。应该指出，这是我们华东地区党的情况的主要和基本的一面。
    但另一方面，由于我们胜利发展的迅速，新解放地区的广大，环境异常复杂，任务极其繁重，老的有经验的干部在数量上不多，新的干部大批吸收进来，又来不及进行系统的教育和改造，再加上华东局在这个时期的领导尚存在若干缺点，因而在工作中伴着胜利与成绩而俱来的，就是发生了许多缺点和错误；其中最主要的，便是官僚主义与命令主义的工作作风，和部分干部以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪。
    同志们！我们的成绩和努力已经受到广大人民的称赞和感谢，我们必须继续努力和发扬。但我们工作中的缺点和错误，也已经引起了群众的不满和造成了工作中的损失，故我们必须坚决加以克服和纠正。下面，我就来根据若干事实，揭发我们在工作中所存在的官僚主义和命令主义的作风及部分干部以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪。但我这里所举的事例，可能是不完整的。因此，我今天的报告只是作为一个开端，其目的在于引起同志们的警惕、检讨和纠正。
    二、反对领导工作中的官僚主义
    脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义作风，是以各种不同的形态，或多或少地存在于我们若干领导机关和若干工作部门中。由于官僚主义是旧的没落的统治阶级的观念形态与工作作风的反映，因而它的危害也就特别的大。在某种意义上说，它是各种不良倾向滋生发展的温床。因此，我们必须坚决克服领导工作中的官僚主义，才能有效地克服工作中的命令主义以及其他各种不良的倾向。现在我就来分析一下官僚主义在我们工作中各方面的表现。
    官僚主义的一种表现，就是高高在上，脱离实际；就是当规定工作任务与工作计划，或在执行上级所规定的工作任务与工作计划时，不是从客观实际出发，而是从主观愿望出发；同时在计划规定以后，便以为万事大吉，不进行经常的系统的认真的检查工作。粗枝大叶，自以为是，缺乏对人民事业高度的责任心，便是这种官僚主义的特点。不幸，我们在这方面的例子是不少的。
    让我举上海区航务局的造船计划为例吧。去年上海解放后，因煤粮运输及支前任务重大，一时感到船只供不应求，航务局经上级决定，在上海建造大批各式船只，建造费达一亿余斤粮食，规模是不小的。至今年五月止，已经造好的船只有一百九十五艘。现在据交通部的检查，这一工作中存在着严重的官僚主义。首先是在制定这个造船计划时，没有很好了解当时上海船只的实际情况。其次，由于领导上不懂造船业务，盲目信任留用人员，工作上粗枝大叶，事先既缺乏详细周密的计划，事后又不进行深入的检查工作，以致所造成的船只大部不合标准。在一百九十五条船只中各厂所造性能不一。有的漏水，有的耗油过多，有的因驾驶间装置过高，不能通过内河桥梁，有的因机器与船身不称，因而开动时震动甚烈，影响船只寿命。除了这些工程上的缺点外，其他工料上的浪费也很严重。
    再看看我们在公粮的调运与保管方面的例子吧。中央财经委员会为了平稳物价，保证上海及华东灾区的粮食供应，曾经在全国范围内进行大规模的粮食调度。这一措施是完全正确的必要的。这一措施不但对于保证华东的粮食供应而且对于平稳全国的物价，都起了极大的作用。同时中国粮食公司华东区公司在执行这个任务上也是有成绩的。但是，可惜中国粮食公司华东区公司在组织和领导这一巨大工作中，同样犯了粗枝大叶、官僚主义的错误，其中最重要的，就是事前对上海各种仓库的容量、条件及其他情形没有进行深入的调查研究，没有根据实际情况估计可以储存的数量，并迅速据实上报，以便上级及时停运过多粮食来沪；而是只凭主观愿望，盲目接运，以致最后发现许多仓库设备不合储粮标准，同时粮食的堆装也大大超过限度。再加上对运到粮食的性质及其所含的水分，事前没有进行化验，入仓后又未加以检查，以致到今年四月中旬，库中粮食大批发热。当时上海库存粮食四亿六千余万斤，发热的就有一亿四千四百余万斤之多，约占总存粮的百分之三十一；个别仓库发热粮食竟达总数百分之六十，且一般均已接近变色变质的危险程度。到了那个时候才急忙组织抢救，积极进行护粮。经抢救后虽绝大部分粮食得以脱险，但人民国家财产所遭受的损失很大。
    这里还不能不联带的指出另一种标本的官僚主义，这就是“饱食终日无所用心”的官僚主义。这种极端恶劣的官僚主义的作风，在我们的队伍里虽然不很多，但这种现象还是有的，故值得我们警惕。例如上海石油公司由于领导上的不负责任，致自去年八月至今，前后由于油轮沉没及被盗窃而损失的汽油即达十八万四千六百余公升。当严重情况已经陆续发现时，该公司领导人还不立即严加检讨，追查责任，并研究克服办法，而仅以高桥储油所所长报告“可能被窃”为理由敷衍了事。这是何等不负责任的态度！无怪该公司在今年二、三月间又连续发生了油池油轮发火和爆炸事件。我们对这种对人民事业和对国家财产不负责任的人，必须使他对国家损失，负担必要的责任。
    官僚主义的又一种表现，就是工作没有中心，不善于依靠群众。整日陷于事务主义的繁忙或忙于命令主义的空喊空叫。即“辛辛苦苦的官僚主义”或“雷厉风行的官僚主义”。它与“饱食终日无所用心”的官僚主义不同。这种官僚主义者的特征是在他主观上确实想把工作搞好，忠勇奋发，不辞劳苦。他们或者每天像毛驴子推磨一样弄得头昏眼花；或者像热锅上的蚂蚁一样，东奔西跑，弄得焦头烂额。可是结果却是费力不讨好，却是“抓了芝麻，丢了西瓜”。为什么会这样呢？主要原因有：第一、在思想方法上犯了主观主义或平均主义的毛病，不懂得区别事情的轻重缓急，主要与次要；不懂得抓住最中心的环节，并集中主要力量去突击这个中心环节，使其他的次要环节得以迎刃而解。而是枝节繁琐，忙于事务主义的应付；或者是简单轻率，忙于空喊空叫，因而形成一种没有头绪的领导。第二、不善于走群众路线，不善于领导组织推动组织，不善于采取科学分工的领导方法与工作方法，不是领导与群众结合，而是领导与群众脱节。像这样的领导，当然是不可能把工作搞好的。然而这种现象在华东却是相当普遍的。
    官僚主义的再一种表现，就是形式主义与文牍主义。就是会议多，文件多，组织重叠，手续繁琐。一定的会议是必要与不可少的；但会议必须有内容、有准备。每一次会议，要解决一个或几个问题。这样的会议，对于了解情况，总结经验，推动工作，教育干部，都是必要的。可是，我们现在有许多会议流于形式。会议愈多，工作愈是深入不下去。兼职多的干部，更是成天在那里开会，很少时间来做实际工作。例如中纺九厂的工会主任，在一个月中要参加五十几次会议。同样，一定的文件，也是必要与不可少的。但计划、指示、决议、表格等必须要能真正起着指导和推动工作的作用，因此，应当重质不重量。而我们现在有许多文件和表格，是官样文章，不合实际需要的。例如：苏南吴江县从一月至四月共收到上级文件，计县委一百二十七件，县府七一七件。请问这么多的文件，除了把下面的工作搞乱以外，还有什么更好的结果呢？再就组织重叠，手续繁琐来说，这是国民党官僚机关的公文手续搬到我们的工作中来的一种形式主义和文牍主义的表现。举一个例子：上海电讯局有一个市民申请装置一架电话机的公事，经过了四十八道手续，拖延了八个半月之久，才把电话机子装上。这种往返“踢皮球”及“公文旅行”，就是官僚主义办事迟缓的基本原因。
    此外，还有一种官僚主义，表现在爱报喜，怕报忧，以及害怕批评与压制批评。我们有些领导机关和领导干部缺乏民主精神与虚心学习态度，往往盛气凌人，令人望而生畏。他只欢喜表扬，而害怕批评；一听到批评就立即怒形于色，拒人于千里之外，甚至采取报复手段。这种固步自封，脱离群众的官僚主义，只有使领导者与被领导者之间，党员与群众之间无形中划出了一条鸿沟，造成上下脱节，内外不调的孤悬状态。例如：本年五月间上海新闻日报发表批评华东贸易部所属企业机关之稿件。新闻日报这种爱护人民政府贸易机关的热忱，本来是值得感激的。可是，被批评的企业机关之一——百货公司的某负责人却缺乏虚心接受批评的精神，反而抓住个别辞句，与新闻日报馆采访主任争执，坚要该报更正，经反复交涉，始进行检讨。又例如皖北日报社会服务栏全年接到对党政机关及干部的批评稿件凡三二八篇，竟有百分之八十以上未得到必要的答复。这种对群众批评置之不理，或限制发表，或对批评者加以打击和报复的态度，显然是与中央决定在一切公开的场合，在人民群众中，特别是在报纸刊物上，展开对于我们工作中的一切错误和缺点的批评与自我批评的精神不相容的。必须克服这种“深闭固拒”的官僚主义，我党与人民的建设事业，才能够大踏步的前进。
    以上就是我们若干领导机关和工作部门所表现的官僚主义的几种主要形态。下面我还要来谈一谈我们在执行工作中的命令主义。
    三、纠正工作中的命令主义
    命令主义实质上是官僚主义在执行工作中的具体表现，是剥削阶级、压迫阶级统治人民的作风在我们革命队伍中的反映。我们进入新区以后，由于环境的复杂，任务的繁重和新成份的大量增加，就更便于这种国民党统治作风的传染。由于命令主义是直接与群众见面的东西，因而群众对它的反感也就最深，它对我党与群众的关系的危害也就特别大。它在我们党与广大群众之间筑起了一道高墙，使群众看不到我党方针与政策的正确面貌，而只看到工作干部命令主义蛮不讲理的不正确作风。因此，如果不坚决地克服命令主义，就必将使我党脱离群众，就必将使人民的革命事业遭受严重的损失。
    首先，让我们来看一看命令主义在财粮工作中的具体表现吧！很明白的，我们的财粮工作是“取之于民，用之于民”，与国民党的“取之于民，用之于己”，是有根本区别的，所以只要我们能够向人民进行反复宣传教育，说清楚这个道理，广大人民是会拥护政府的公粮、税收政策的。可惜我们很多工作人员，不懂得这个粗浅的道理，有的任务一来，就不择手段，抄袭了国民党的老办法，采取了蛮不讲理，强迫命令的作风。例如：各省在征粮工作中，曾经不少地区发生过逐级加派以及乱打、乱抓、乱罚、甚至逼死人等严重现象。
    在税收与公债工作中也发生了上述类似的情况。当上海进行检查第四期营业税的时候，税收干部强调查账。于是查账人员为了要完成任务，在查账中甚至有故意找岔子的现象，找到问题，税局有时不加考虑即行重罚。在推销公债运动中，也有以强迫命令的方式去逼销公债的。例如在苏北扬州一个城市即有二十几个商人，因交不出公债，而受到斗争。
    在农村领导生产救灾运动中，因干部采取强迫命令的办法而脱离群众的现象，也是不少的。生产救灾工作明明是对群众直接有利的，因而也是容易获得群众拥护的事情。可是，有的地方恰恰相反，因为我们的干部不懂得依靠群众，不懂得采取群众路线，不懂得事事与群众讨论商量，而是采取强迫命令的方法，结果反而把事情搞坏。例如武进县百丈区动员群众修堤防水，因为采取了强迫群众派夫和雇夫等命令主义的方法，竟至群众为匪特所煽动，造成数千群众的骚动事件。
    命令主义的作风，在公安工作干部中也表现得严重，值得全党警惕。因为公安机关是实行人民民主专政的重要工具之一，它一方面对危害人民利益的国内外反革命分子与土匪特务应当坚决执行镇压政策，另一方面对人民的利益与民主权利，应当坚决采取保护的方针。这是人民公安机关与国民党反动派的警察局基本性质不同的所在。可惜，我们人民公安部门有些工作人员在执行保卫人民民主权利与捍卫人民利益的工作中，一方面对罪大恶极的反革命分子采取了无原则的宽大，另方面对一般普通案件又犯了严重的命令主义和乱打、乱抓、乱罚、甚至乱杀的错误倾向。例如上海一个分局的检讨，有百分之八十的刑事警察打过人；又另一个分局的检讨，有百分之九十的刑事罪犯挨过打。其他各地区的公安机关中，随便打人、抓人、罚款的情形也是严重的。例如皖北阜阳专区十个县中，就有八个县的公安局长亲自打过人。这种现象是十分严重而必须迅速加以纠正的。只有彻底肃清过去国民党对人民蛮横无理，擅作威福，乱打、乱抓、乱罚、乱杀的恶劣作风，才不致玷污人民利益的保护者——人民警察的光荣称号！
    在其他各种工作中，命令主义的作风，同样是或多或少的存在着，希望各地各工作部门的同志，认真注意，严加检讨。
    各地经验证明：凡是干部命令主义作风特别严重的地方，群众就开始离开我们，我们的干部就逐步陷于孤立，我们的工作就难于做通，我们的困难就越发严重，匪特和反动分子就得以乘间伺隙，造谣破坏，挑拨离间，甚至煽动群众对我们进行骚动，使国家和人民遭受到严重的损失。这种痛苦经验教训，必须引起全党警惕。
    四、克服以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪
    由于中国革命已经取得全国范围的基本胜利，在我党个别党员干部中产生了一种以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪，产生了一种贪图享受不求进步的情绪。这些同志在工作中斤斤计较个人的地位和待遇，而不计较自己对党对人民事业的贡献和努力。他们看不起新党员新干部，看不起群众和党外人士。他们轻视党的纪律和政府的法令。
    抱着这种错误思想的同志，他们不了解今天革命的胜利，首先是由于全国人民力量的伟大和我党与毛主席正确领导的结果，因此任何个人是不应当骄傲自满的。他们不了解“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完第一步”，“以后革命的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦，”因此，我们必须继续谦虚谨慎，更好和党外人士实行民主合作，必须继续发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，才能巩固目前的胜利，才能取得将来更伟大的胜利。
    骄傲自满不求进步的同志，必须牢牢记住这条道理，即：如果我们不克服闭门幽居称王称霸的关门主义与宗派主义的错误倾向，我们便有脱离群众使人民革命事业遭受失败的危险。如果我们不克服个人主义与腐化堕落的思想，我们便有从革命队伍中掉下队来，而最后为人民所抛弃的危险。
    总的说来，上述各种官僚主义命令主义的恶劣作风，和骄傲自满功臣自居的错误思想，虽然绝对不能代表我们党的思想与作风，但今天在我们华东地区党内，已经不仅仅是个别的现象，而是相当普遍的严重现象。所以，必须引起我们特别警惕和注意。所以，我们必须按照中央的指示和决定，迅速开展整风运动，并须从整风运动中，坚决克服上述各种不良作风。
    五、开展整风运动，在毛泽东的胜利旗帜下迈进！
    关于如何根据中央整风指示原则，及如何针对目前华东地区党内的主要缺点，来开展整风运动，中共中央华东局已有专门的指示，故不再重复。我在这里只着重地指出下列几点：
    （一）这次整风是在革命战争已在全国范围得到迅速胜利的条件下进行的。由于革命战争在全国范围得到迅速的胜利，由于各项工作极其繁重而复杂，及大批新干部吸收进来，还来不及进行系统的教育，因此今天我们党内所表现出来的错误倾向，在较高级领导机关与领导干部方面，主要是官僚主义；在中下级工作机关与工作干部方面，主要是命令主义；在部分老干部方面，主要是生长着一种以功臣自居、骄傲自满、不求进步的情绪；在与党外人士合作方面，主要是忽视统一战线工作的关门主义的倾向。因此这次整风的主要任务和目的，也就是要克服目前党内所存在的官僚主义、命令主义、关门主义，及以功臣自居、骄傲自满等等恶劣作风，以加强我党和城乡全体人民群众的联系，巩固人民民主统一战线，以便于顺利地进行新区农村中的土地改革工作，和城市中的调整工商业工作。
    （二）整风的基本方法，应当是由上而下地逐级召集干部整风会议，或开办整风训练班，并在会议中或训练班中，学习毛主席在中共七届三中全会报告和其他少数指定文件，总结当地工作，展开批评与自我批评。整风的基本环节就是要把整风运动和各项工作任务密切结合起来。应当把对文件和报告的学习研究与对当前实际工作的检查密切地结合起来；应当把由上而下的自我批评与由下而上的检讨批评密切地结合起来。但检查和总结过去工作的目的，在于纠正过去的错误及改进今后的工作，而不是为了算旧账。整风的重点应放在各级干部方面。因为把负责干部作风首先整好，不但可以经过他们逐级深入整风运动，而且也易于消除一般干部对整风的顾虑。
    （三）一切形式的整风运动，都要求有健全的组织领导。不管是整风会议或整风训练班，在具体领导上要做到首长负责，亲自动手，并须注意领导骨干与群众相结合，以防止包办代替或放任自流。
    同志们！这一次大规模的整风运动是土改与建党的一个严重步骤。今冬开始的土地改革能否顺利完成，目前我党在思想上、作风上所存在的某些不纯状态能否顺利克服，均以此次整风运动有无成绩或成绩大小为主要关键。因此，各级党委必须加强整风运动的领导，必须为保证整风任务的顺利完成而努力。
    同志们！我们过去一年的成绩是伟大的，但是我们工作中的缺点和错误也确实不少。我们不要害怕公开揭发我们的缺点和错误，我们应当坚决纠正我们的缺点和错误。毛主席说：“以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道我们还有什么错误的不适合人民需要的思想、观点、意见、办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？难道我们还欢迎任何政治的灰尘，政治的微生物来玷污我们的清洁的面貌与侵蚀我们的健全的肌体吗？无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益或错误、缺点，不能牺牲吗？”（论联合政府）
    同志们！我们过去在毛主席和党中央正确领导下，团结全国人民，执行党的正确路线和政策，学习正确的工作作风，纠正了各种错误的偏向。因此，我们能够击败国内外敌人，取得今天伟大历史意义的胜利。我们今后在毛主席胜利的旗帜下，继续团结全国人民，执行我党正确的路线和政策，学习正确的工作作风，并坚决纠正各种错误的偏向，我们必将取得全国经济状况的基本好转，必将取得建设新中国的更伟大胜利！
