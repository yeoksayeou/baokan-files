　　North China People's Hospital Accepts Readers' Criticism
    Begins Establishing Systems to Improve Work
To the Editors:
    Based on the criticisms in the newspaper, we conducted a review of the hospital's work systems and living conditions, and also conducted a self-criticism regarding our leadership thinking. Aiming at the shortcomings in our work, we established necessary systems, began to improve our work, and achieved some results. This was after a painful process.
    After Comrade Lou Shi-yi made criticisms of our hospital on July 5th, it caused a great deal of fluctuation among the staff. Some people felt that our bad reputation had spread far and wide, and they couldn't work. Who would trust our skills, who would want to come for treatment? Some expressed disagreement, thinking that other hospitals had similar situations, so why only criticize us? This shows they are prejudiced against us. Some also said: We had achievements in our work in the past during the work competition and crash programs. The newspaper only talks about the shortcomings and doesn't mention the advantages, the reporting is not comprehensive enough. There were also some people who took a wait-and-see attitude, feeling that the newspaper was criticizing the doctors and it had nothing to do with them. After learning about these reactions, we felt that these thoughts were a serious obstacle to improving our work and should be resolved quickly. Therefore, on August 7th, we convened a general meeting of all personnel to explain to everyone: As long as what the newspaper published is factual, we should address the specific issues, conduct serious self-criticism, and it is wrong to disagree. At the same time, it was pointed out that pessimism, despair, and panic are also wrong. We must recognize that the material, technical, and human resources of the North China People's Hospital are not bad. As long as comrades dare to face the shortcomings, correct the mistakes; do not be complacent and close ourselves off, learn with an open mind, and work hard, we will definitely be able to improve the hospital. After explanation, persuasion, and organizing the study of the newspaper, the emotions of most people, except for a few, have stabilized and they have begun to work actively.
    From August 7th to 12th, we organized all hospital personnel to study. Focusing on reading the newspaper (referring to reading the criticism articles by Comrades Lou Shi-yi and Ding Tuo), we first conducted a self-criticism from the leadership. Dean Zhang reviewed and said: "I am a hard-working bureaucrat, doing a lot of administrative work, without concentrating my energy on solving the main problems of the entire hospital." Director He Yun-qiao held the August 3rd People's Daily and repeatedly and carefully read the critical articles in the People's Garden, marking them. At first, he couldn't understand, feeling that the critics were looking for faults and deliberately attacking; after studying, he realized that he was not open-minded and made a preliminary self-criticism at the central group meeting. While checking our thinking, we also reformed the system and improved our work. In order to understand the situation and solve problems in a timely manner, a daily reporting system was established. As a result of the implementation of this system, the dean can grasp the overall situation of the hospital, actively solve problems, and plug many loopholes. In the past, pharmacists often made mistakes. Now, a pharmacist inspection system has been established. Therefore, the pharmacist Jiang Ming taking penicillin as streptomycin, the pharmacist Liu taking mercuric chloride as red mercury, and copying prescriptions incorrectly, were all discovered and corrected in time through inspection.
    In the reception system, in the past there were no doctors on duty in the reception room. After the patient arrived, the doctor was temporarily called to the ward. In this way, patients often had to wait for more than half an hour before being admitted to the hospital. Emergency patients could not receive prompt medical treatment, and some would even endanger their lives. Now, a doctor on duty system has been established. Patients can be received and treated within five minutes of arriving at the hospital. For example, Comrade Hu Zhi-fan, suffering from acute appendicitis, arrived at the hospital at 5:50 pm on July 28th, was diagnosed by the doctor in the reception room, and was immediately sent to the operating room for surgery. Comrade Ma Zhi-qing of the Ministry of Public Security suffered from eclampsia. She arrived at the hospital at 12:00 pm on August 16th. After being admitted to the ward by the doctor in the reception room, the admission procedures were completed. This ensures timely treatment for emergency patients and saves the lives of some patients.
    In the past, doctors often took a resistant attitude towards consultations. They had feelings of jealousy and were unwilling to provide medical records to other doctors, making it difficult for consulting doctors to work. After studying, the doctors realized that consultation is helpful to their work, and there are only benefits, no disadvantages. Therefore, they are also more open-minded. Recently, Lu Yanbin of pediatrics suffered from congenital heart disease, Zhao Caiyun of gynecology suffered from gestational malignant pustule, and Gong Shuying of internal medicine suffered from encephalitis. Because the diagnosis in our hospital was unclear, we invited Dr. Ma Wansen, Dr. Zhong of the Central People's Hospital, and Director Wang of Obstetrics and Gynecology for consultations.
    After checking the work and reforming the system, the doctors overcame their panic and worked actively, expressing their determination to establish the concept of serving patients in practical actions, cultivate concern and sympathy for patients' suffering, and promote the revolutionary humanitarian spirit. This spirit was fully demonstrated when inducing labor for Comrade Tao Xiuwen, the wife of Wang Pingyu of the International News Bureau. Tao was admitted to the hospital for delivery on July 14th. After more than 20 days, there were no signs of labor. After examination, it was found to be dystocia. On August 8th, we decided to induce labor for her with surgery. This type of induced labor surgery is very dangerous, but with the tireless work of all the comrades in the obstetrics department, after two days, their mother and daughter were finally safe. This is a new atmosphere in the North China People's Hospital, and it is a good start.
    The criticism in the newspaper has greatly helped in promoting our work improvement. With the criticism in the newspaper, our minds were cleared, the chaos within the hospital was quickly cleared up, and initial achievements were made in improving our work. However, we are not satisfied with this. We know that this is only the beginning of progress. The work of the hospital has not been fully improved. For example, the internal medicine work system is not sound, the political and professional education of personnel has not been done well, the patient's food has not been improved, and various systems still need to be continuously established and consolidated. All of these require us to make great efforts. We firmly believe that on the basis of this progress, the hospital can be well-managed.

### 华北人民医院接受读者批评  开始建立制度改进工作

　　华北人民医院接受读者批评
    开始建立制度改进工作编辑同志：
    我们根据报纸的批评，对医院的工作制度、生活卫生等方面做了检查，并从领导思想上进行了检讨。针对着工作中的缺点，建立了必要的制度，开始改进了工作，并获得一些成绩。这是经过一段痛苦过程的。
    七月五日，楼适夷同志对本院提出批评之后，工作人员中曾经引起很大波动。有些人觉得坏名远扬，没法工作了。谁相信咱的技术，谁还愿来治病呢？有的表示不服气，认为别的医院也有类似情况，为什么光批评我们呢？这是对我们有成见。也有的说：我们过去在开展工作竞赛和突击运动中，工作是有成绩的。而报纸光说缺点，不谈优点，报道的不够全面。还有一些人采取旁观的态度，觉得报纸批评的是大夫，与自己无关。我们了解到这些反映后，觉得这些思想是改进工作的严重阻碍，应该迅速解决。因此，于八月七号召开了全体人员大会，向大家讲明：只要报纸登的是事实，应该就事论事，认真检讨，不服气是不对的。同时也指出悲观失望，惊慌失措也是错误的。要认识华北人民医院的物质、技术和人力条件都是不坏的。只要同志们敢于正视缺点，纠正错误；不要固步自封，虚心学习，努力工作，一定能把医院搞好。经过解释说服和组织学习报纸之后，除少数外，大部人员的情绪已稳定下来，开始积极工作。
    八月七号至十二号一周内，组织了全院人员进行学习。以读报（指阅读楼适夷和丁拓同志的批评文章）为主，先从领导上进行检查。张院长检讨说：“我是辛辛苦苦的官僚主义，做了许多事务工作，没有集中精力解决全院的主要问题。”贺云翘主任拿着八月三号的人民日报反来覆去地仔细阅读人民园地上的批评文章，打着记号。起初他想不通，觉得批评者是在找毛病，有意的攻击；经学习后，他认识到是自己不虚心，在中心小组会上做了初步检讨。我们一面检查思想，一面改革制度和改进工作。为及时了解情况，解决问题，规定每日汇报制。这种制度实行的结果，院长就能掌握全院情况，主动的解决问题，堵塞了不少漏洞。过去司药常常出错，现在建立了司药检查制度。因此，司药姜鸣将盘尼西林错拿成链霉素、刘药剂师将红汞拿成升汞，以及抄错处方等，都经检查发现，及时纠正。
    在接诊制度上，过去接诊室没有医生值班，病人来后，临时到病房去叫医生。这样，往往使病人等半小时以上才能入院。急诊病员不能因迅速就医，有的就要贻害生命。现在，建立了大夫值班制度，病人到院后不过五分钟即可接诊治疗。譬如：胡沚蘩同志患急性兰尾炎，于七月二十八日午后五时五十分到院，由接诊室医生诊断后，立即送入手术室施行手术。公安部马志清同志患子痫病，八月十六日夜十二时到院，经接诊医生接入病房后，才办理入院手续。这就保证了急诊病员的及时治疗，急救了一些病员的生命。
    过去，大夫们对会诊往往采取抵抗的态度。他们对其他医生存有旁观嫉妒的心理，不愿供给病历，致使会诊医生很难工作。经过学习，大夫们认识到会诊是帮助工作的，只有好处，没有坏处。因此也比较虚心了。最近，小儿科吕燕斌患先天性心脏病，妇科赵彩云患妊娠恶疽，内科龚淑英系大脑炎，均因本院诊断不明，分别请马万森大夫、中央人民医院钟大夫和妇产科王主任会诊。
    经过检查工作和制度的改革，大夫们克服了惊惶失措的情绪，积极的工作起来，表示要在实际行动中树立为病员服务的观点，养成对病员痛苦的关怀和同情心，发扬革命的人道主义精神。在给国际新闻局王聘余同志的爱人陶秀文同志引产时，充分表现了这种精神。陶于七月十四日入院生产，二十多天不见临产迹象，后经检查始知是难产。八月八日我们决定给她引产动手术。这种引产手术是很危险的，但在产科全体同志不知疲倦的工作下，经过两天时间，终于使她们母女获得安全。这是华北人民医院的新气象，是一个良好的开端。
    报纸的批评，在推动我们改进工作上帮助很大。有了报纸的批评，才使我们的头脑清醒过来，迅速地澄清了医院内部的混乱现象，初步取得了改进工作的成绩。但是，我们并不以此而满足。我们知道这仅是进步的开始，医院的工作还没有全面搞好，如内科工作制度不健全，人员的政治与业务教育没搞好，病员的伙食没改善，各种制度仍须继续建立与巩固。所有这些，都需要我们付出极大的努力。我们深信，在这种进步的基础上是能够把医院办好的。
