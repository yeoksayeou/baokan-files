    The Pentagon's Iron Curtain
    The Truth About American "Freedom of the Press"
    When instigating the Korean War, the American aggressors were so sure that their advance towards Pyongyang would be as easy as taking a leisurely stroll. Therefore, they did not bother to instruct the reporters of the newspapers on what "tone" to use when reporting the news from the front lines, but allowed them to report what they saw according to their own wishes.
    However, the subsequent facts completely overturned the aggressors' hopes. When the reporters initially reported what they saw, the readers of the American domestic newspapers learned some of the things that were happening on the Korean battlefield as a result. Furthermore, they learned of the massacres and barbaric acts of revenge committed by the American troops against the Korean residents. At the same time, they also learned of the South Korean people's hatred for the American aggressors. So MacArthur flew into a rage and began to try to salvage America's "prestige." "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Higgins was therefore expelled from Korea, and United Press's Kealish and Associated Press's Lambert were also transferred from the war zone. In General Walker's field headquarters, the issue of establishing a strict military censorship system was hastily "studied."
    But MacArthur seemed to have gone a bit too far. Protests poured in from all over the United States, forcing him to rescind the bans on Higgins, Kealish, and Lambert. Since then, the work of salvaging America's "prestige" has been handed over to the U.S. Department of Defense. The Pentagon (the location of the U.S. Department of Defense) began holding daily "flying conferences" for reporters. At these meetings, they prepared "digested," false news, and told reporters how to handle it in order to conceal the facts. In short, every matter had to be fabricated so that what people saw in the newspapers was not the real facts, but what the Department of Defense and the State Department needed.
    The reason is obvious: the Department of Defense does not want to excessively publicize these "flying conferences" for fabricating facts. Therefore, the American authorities have slowly turned these meetings, which were originally frequently open to all American and foreign newspaper reporters, into secret affairs. And after obtaining permission from Washington, the Department of Defense refused to allow TASS reporters to participate. This heinous act of discrimination against TASS reporters exposed the essence of the Department of Defense as a so-called "public opinion organizer." They were afraid of the representatives of honest and objective Soviet newspapers attending their "flying conferences."
    It is obvious that news manufactured by the Pentagon cannot be regarded as the basis for the truth about the military operations in Korea. But the matter is not just that; the entire process also illustrates the true value of the "freedom of the press" and the principles of "free and equal access to news" that are constantly upheld by American official spokespersons at international conferences and boasted about by Americans. Because in practice, it proves to be nothing more than intimidation and deliberate fabrication. And America's sham democracy is built on these things.

　　五角大楼的铁幕
    美国“新闻自由”的真相
    在挑动朝鲜战争时，美国的侵略者们是如此地确信：他们向平壤进犯只要像踱方步一样就可以了。因此他们并没有操心去告诫各报的记者们要用什么“论调”来报道前线的消息，而让他们照自己的意思来报道他们所见到的事情。
    但是，后来的事实却完全推翻了侵略者们的希望，记者们在开始时把他们所见到的报道出来，美国国内报纸的读者就因此而知道了一些在朝鲜战场上发生的事情。此外，他还知道，美国军队对朝鲜居民所进行的屠杀与野蛮的报复行为，他同时也知道了南朝鲜人民对于美国侵略者的仇恨。于是麦克阿瑟恼羞成怒，就开始出来挽救美国的“威信”了。《纽约先锋论坛报》的记者赫金斯因此被逐出了朝鲜，合众社的开利许与美联社的兰伯特也被从战区中调走了。在瓦克将军的野战总部里，匆忙地“研究”了关于建立严格军事新闻检查制度的问题。
    但是麦克阿瑟似乎干得有些过分了。抗议从美国各地纷至沓来，使他不得不取消了关于赫金斯、开利许与兰伯特的禁令。自此以后，挽救美国“威信”的工作就移交给美国国防部了。五角大楼（美国国防部所在地）每天开始为记者们举行“飞行会议”，在这个会上，他们预备好了“经过消化的”、虚伪的新闻，并且告诉记者们要如何处理以便隐匿事实。总之，每一桩事都要经过捏造，使人们从报纸上所看到的不是真正的事实，而是国防部与国务院所需要的东西。
    道理是很明显的，国防部并不希望过分地公开这些捏造事实的“飞行会议”。因此，美国当局就慢慢地把这些原来经常公开于所有美国与国外报纸记者面前的会议，变成为秘密的事情了。而国防部在得到了华盛顿的许可之后，就拒绝塔斯社记者去参加。这一对于塔斯社记者的穷凶极恶的歧视行为，暴露了所谓“公众舆论组织者”国防部的本质。他们害怕正直的与客观的苏联报纸的代表去参加他们的“飞行会议”。
    从五角大楼制造出来的新闻，不能视为在朝鲜的军事行动真相的基础，这是很显然的。但事情不单是如此而已，整个的过程还说明了被美国官方发言人在国际会议上所口口声声地维护的、被美国人吹嘘的“新闻自由”与“自由、平等地取得新闻”的原则的真正价值。因为执行的时候，证明了它只是恫吓和蓄意造谣。而美国的假民主正是建立在这些事情上面的。
