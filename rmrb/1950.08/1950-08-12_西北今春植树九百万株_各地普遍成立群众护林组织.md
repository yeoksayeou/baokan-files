Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 10th: The Northwest region has achieved significant results in its spring afforestation work. According to statistics from 101 counties and cities in the region (approximately 34% of all counties and cities in Northwest China), over 9.2 million trees were planted this spring, accounting for 32% of the Northwest region's annual tree planting plan. Qinghai Province has already completed over 160% of its total annual tree planting target, while Ningxia Province has completed 91%. In individual counties, such as Huzhu County in Qinghai, the original plan was to plant 50,000 trees, but the actual number planted exceeded 320,000, surpassing the original plan by 5.4 times. Regarding forest protection: the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the People's Governments of various provinces have successively issued circulars strictly prohibiting the destruction and arbitrary felling of forests. Management agencies have been established in most forest areas of the provinces to specialize in forest management and operation. For example, the Qinling Forest Area Management Office has five management stations under it; the Die Min Forestry Bureau of Gansu has established twelve management stations. Forestry management organizations have also been established in forest areas of Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang. Mass forest protection committees and forest protection groups have been established in various places at the township level, and forest protection covenants have been stipulated.

In addition, forest surveys in various provinces are also being carried out according to the original plan. Gansu Province has formed four forest area survey teams for the Qilian Mountains, Tao River, Bailong River, and Yellow River. The Central Forestry and Land Reclamation Department and the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Department have also jointly formed a forest survey team that arrived in the Tao River and Bailong River forest areas in mid-July to conduct detailed surveys in coordination with the Gansu survey team. The Qinling Management Office of Shaanxi has formed five survey teams on the northern slope of the Qinling Mountains, and the Qinghai Province forest area survey team has rushed to the Huzhu and Guide forest areas to conduct surveys.

　　西北今春植树九百万株
    各地普遍成立群众护林组织
    【新华社西安十日电】西北区今春的植树造林工作已有显著成绩。据该区一百零一个县、市（约占全西北区县、市的百分之三十四）的统计，今春共植树九百二十余万株，占西北区全年植树计划的百分之三十二。其中青海省已完成全年植树总任务的百分之一百六十多，宁夏省完成百分之九十一。个别县份如青海互助县，原布置栽植五万株，结果栽植三十二万余株，超过原计划的五点四倍。在林业保护方面：西北军政委员会及各省人民政府曾先后颁发通令，严禁破坏和任意采伐森林。各省森林地区大部成立管理机关，专司森林管理和经营。如秦岭林区管理处，下设五个管理站；甘肃叠岷林务处则设立了十二个管理站，其他青海、宁夏、新疆各林区也都建立了林业管理所的组织。各地并以乡为单位成立了群众性的护林委员会和护林小组，规定了护林公约。
    此外，各省的森林调查工作亦正按照原来计划进行。甘肃省已组成祁连山、洮河、白龙江、黄河四个林区调查队，中央林垦部和西北农林部也合组森林调查队于七月中旬到达洮河、白龙江林区，配合甘肃调查队进行重步调查工作。陕西秦岭管理处业已组成秦岭北坡的五个调查队，青海省的林区调查队已赶赴互助、贵德林区进行调查工作。
