Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a "Notice on Rectifying Trade Union Organizations and Cadre Work Style" on the 11th.

The notice pointed out that under the call and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, a rectification movement is underway throughout the country. According to Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, this rectification should be carried out in close combination with various work tasks, not in isolation. Its purpose is to improve the ideological and political level of cadres, overcome mistakes and shortcomings in their work, and improve relations with the people. Therefore, as the Party's loyal assistant—the lever and link connecting the Party and the masses—the trade union is very important. In the rectification, we must not only examine and summarize our work, but especially examine the shortcomings in our work and the major problems in our work attitude, viewpoint, style, and methods, so that with the progress of the rectification movement, we can improve our trade union work and enhance the political and theoretical level of our trade union cadres.

The notice put forward the following six points as the main contents for trade union organizations at all levels to examine and summarize their work during the rectification:

(1) Trade union organizations at all levels nationwide should specifically arrange rectification work in accordance with the local Party's instructions and plans for rectification, and must grasp this work firmly as one of the central tasks of this period, and carry it out vigorously. It is necessary to implement Chairman Mao's instruction: "Leading cadres take responsibility and personally get involved."

(2) Examine the advantages and disadvantages of our implementation of policies, resolutions, and decrees, and especially examine whether we maintain close contact with the working masses, whether we care for the masses, understand the masses, help the masses, and serve the masses wholeheartedly.

(3) The work examination should be carried out together with the masses. We must deeply recognize and review our undesirable work styles, especially the bureaucratic, commandist, and undemocratic styles, and must launch criticism and self-criticism to overcome them.

(4) In order to have a clear understanding ideologically, it is necessary to first conscientiously read documents. In addition to the rectification documents designated by the local Party committees, trade union cadres should also specially study Comrade Liu Shaoqi's chapter on the mass line in the report on the revision of the Party Constitution, Lenin's "The Role and Tasks of Trade Unions Under the New Economic Policy," the Trade Union Law, and Comrade Deng Zihui's recent report at the enlarged meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Central South Federation of Trade Unions. Also, refer to the Workers' Daily editorial of August 6, "Rectifying Trade Union Organizations and Cadre Work Style."

(5) When summarizing work, do not list too many items, but grasp a few major issues, conduct a thorough examination, and clarify the thinking. First, leading comrades can make a work summary report, and then launch a bottom-up discussion to examine the work.

(6) Trade union organizations at all levels should submit a written report to the higher-level leading organs at the end of the rectification. The general trade unions of major administrative regions (or the All-China Federation's offices), the five provinces and two cities in North China, and the national committees (or preparatory committees) of various industrial trade unions should submit a written report to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

　　中华全国总工会发出通知
    整顿工会组织和干部作风
    【新华社十二日讯】中华全国总工会于十一日发出“关于整顿工会组织与工会干部作风问题的通知”。
    通知指出在中国共产党的号召与领导之下，全国各地正在进行整风运动。根据毛主席在中共中央三中全会的报告，这次整风应在和各项工作任务密切相结合而不是相分离的条件之下进行，其目的是提高干部的思想水平和政治水平，克服工作中所犯的错误和缺点，改善与人民的关系。因此，作为党的忠实助手——党与群众联系的杠杆与纽带的工会说来，是非常重要的。在整风中不仅要检查和总结我们的工作，特别要检查我们在工作中所存在的缺点以及在工作态度、观点、作风、方法等方面的重大问题，以便随着整风运动的进展，把我们的工会工作提高一步，把我们工会工作干部的政治理论水平提高一步。
    通知提出以下六项，作为各级工会组织在整风中检查和总结工作的主要内容：
    （一）全国各级工会组织应按照当地党对整风的指示和计划具体地布置整风工作，并务须抓紧此一工作，作为这一时期中心工作之一，以大力来进行，必须实行毛主席的指示：“首长负责、亲自动手”。
    （二）检查我们有关执行政策决议法令的优缺点，特别要检查我们是否与工人群众保持密切的联系，是否关心群众、了解群众、帮助群众，全心全意地为群众服务。
    （三）检查工作应与群众一起来进行检查。要深刻地认识和检讨，我们一些不好的工作作风，特别是官僚主义命令主义和不民主的作风，必须展开批评与自我批评加以克服。
    （四）为了在思想上有一个明确的认识，必须首先认真地阅读文件，除掉各地党委所指定的整风文件以外，工会干部还应特别学习刘少奇同志关于修改党章报告中的群众路线一章，列宁的“新经济政策下职工会的作用与任务”，工会法及邓子恢同志最近在中南总工会筹委扩大会议上的报告。并参考工人日报八月六日社论“整顿工会组织与工会干部作风”一文。
    （五）在总结工作时，项目不要列得太多，而要抓紧几个主要问题，作透彻的检查，把思想弄清楚。首先可由领导同志作工作总结报告，然后发动由下而上的讨论，来检查工作。
    （六）各级工会组织应于整风结束时，应向上级领导机关作一次书面报告。各大行政区总工会（或全总办事处）、华北五省二市以及各产业工会全国委员会（或筹委会）应向全国总工会作一书面报告。
