[Reported by this newspaper] The Beijing Municipality, since May of this year, has had four districts conduct district people's representative meetings to review government work and inspect the conduct and discipline of cadres. Experience has proven that by combining the summary and review of work and the inspection of cadre conduct with broad mass criticism through district people's representative meetings, good results can be achieved in implementing policies, educating cadres, and strengthening the relationship between the Party, the government, and the people.

Before the meetings, each district conducted relatively thorough publicity and deliberation among the masses through various means, soliciting opinions on government work and cadre conduct. The district governments convened cadre meetings to summarize various tasks and prepare reports to be presented at the meetings. Cadres studied documents such as Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report at the "May Day" celebration this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, and conducted conduct inspections.

During the people's representative meetings in the four districts, the representatives unanimously praised and supported the great achievements of the government work and the excellent conduct of the majority of cadres who worked hard and served the people loyally. More than a hundred critical opinions were raised regarding shortcomings in the work and cadre conduct. The masses criticized the poor attitude of some public security personnel and that some people had not completely abandoned the habits of old police officers; some tax workers were not patient in explaining tax issues to the masses and did not conduct sufficient in-depth investigation and research in their work; district government mediation of cases and the civil affairs section's handling of military family issues were sometimes simplistic and harsh in their approach; some retail stores and cooperative personnel lacked a strong mass perspective; and individual personnel in the vendor management office oppressed and extorted merchants.

During the meetings, the district governments reported on various tasks, and based on their own inspection of the work and the criticism from the masses, made a report on the self-criticism of the cadre's work style. Among them, each district selected typical issues related to the interests of the broad masses, and after thorough investigation and research, made detailed reports on the self-criticism. For example, the government of the First District, because a military and cadre family factory rented a temple building (public property), forcibly relocated fourteen poor families living in the temple. This caused dissatisfaction among the fourteen families, who jointly submitted their opinions to the representative meeting. The district chief criticized the mistake of coercion and commandism made in the process of handling this matter and decided not to ask them to move again. Shi Xitai, a former police officer in the Fifth District (now a member of the Communist Youth League), had a poor attitude towards the masses and used simplistic and coercive methods in mobilizing the masses to buy public bonds and in immigration work. The masses said that he was "excessively active," representing the work style of a certain type of police officer. After education from the leadership and the masses, he realized his mistakes and made a profound self-criticism at the meeting.

The self-criticism of various problems similar to the above gave the representatives a deep impression. Everyone felt that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the common people had truly turned over politically and economically. Some representatives reflected: "The cadres are so busy, their lives are so hard, and they still have to be criticized and make self-criticism for small mistakes, admitting their mistakes. How could they do this if they were not cadres who were loyal to the people?"

After Mass Criticism and Inspection, Cadres Strengthened Their Mass Perspective

After extensive mass criticism and inspection, the cadres strengthened their mass perspective and the spirit of investigation and research and delving into reality. Everyone felt that the style of closing the door and doing things as one pleases is no longer acceptable.

After the representative meetings, the cadres generally paid attention to and were vigilant about the shortcomings of commandism, and their work became more meticulous and conscientious. In the past, the civil affairs section of the Fifth District did not distribute preferential grain to military families fairly enough. Now, they are holding forums with military families to jointly study reasonable distribution methods. After the representative meeting, the government of the Seventh District improved its working methods and implemented various systems. Each section summarizes its work for the week and formulates plans for the following week at the weekly section meetings held every Friday; at the district affairs meetings held every Saturday, the work of each section is discussed, major issues are handled, and the ideological situation of the cadres is studied. Some sections hold contact meetings every night to exchange opinions and plan the work for the next day, and everyone goes out to work separately as soon as they finish breakfast the next day. Mobilizing citizens to repair houses is an important task decided by the people's representatives of the district. The district chief personally led cadres to explain and mobilize homeowners and tenants, and ordinary cadres also learned working methods from this. The people of the district also support their government more, and many representatives actively mobilize or personally lead the masses to repair houses and pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and are busy increasing the number of people's schools and night schools.

Two Important Experiences

Based on the experience of the four districts in carrying out this work, the following two points are particularly important:

(1) Before the meeting, the leadership must pay attention to making full preparations in the ideology of the cadres by studying documents and inspecting work. In the beginning, some districts did not pay enough attention to this, so that some cadres passively conducted self-criticism based on the criticism of the masses at the meeting, making it difficult to achieve the desired effect.

(2) When the representatives are not yet able to speak freely and boldly criticize, more inspiration should be given. After criticism is launched, attention should be paid to guiding it in the direction of actively improving work. The leadership should enable the representatives to appropriately recognize the achievements and shortcomings of the work and the merits and demerits of the cadres. Avoid causing negative emotions among a portion of the personnel who have been working for a shorter period of time and whose ideological awareness is relatively poor.

　　京市通过区各界人民代表会
    检讨政府工作检查干部作风
    对命令主义缺点已引起普遍警惕与改进
    【本报讯】北京市自今年五月以来，已有四个区，经过区人民代表会议检讨政府工作，检查了干部的作风和纪律。经验证明：通过区人民代表会议，领导上把总结、检讨工作、检查干部作风，与广泛的群众性的批评结合进行，对贯彻政策、教育干部、密切党和政府与人民的关系，可以收到很好的效果。
    各区在会议前，曾通过各种方式在群众中进行了比较充分的宣传、酝酿，征求群众对政府工作及干部作风的意见。区政府召开干部会，总结了各项工作，准备在会议中作报告。干部曾学习了刘少奇同志在今年“五一”节的报告、中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定等文件，并进行了作风检查。
    在四个区的人民代表会议中，代表们对政府工作的伟大成绩及大多数干部吃苦耐劳忠心为人民服务的优良作风，一致赞扬和拥护；对工作中的缺点及干部作风上所提出的批评性的意见，都在百条以上。群众批评了某些公安人员的态度不好，有些人的旧警士习气还未完全改掉；某些税务工作人员不耐心对群众解释纳税中的一些问题，工作中深入调查研究不够；区政府调解案件、民政科处理军属问题有时方式简单，态度生硬；某些零售店、合作社人员的群众观点不强；摊贩管理处个别人员欺压、敲诈商民。
    在会议中，区政府报告了各项工作；根据自己对工作的检查及群众的批评，作了干部作风问题的检讨报告。其中，各区并选择了某些关系广大群众利益的典型问题，经过周密地调查研究后，作了详细的检讨报告。如一区区政府因军干属工厂租用庙房（公产），曾强迫住在庙内的十四家贫民搬家。此事引起十四家的不满，联名向代表会提出意见。该区区长检讨了在处理此事过程中所犯的强迫命令的错误，并决定不再叫他们搬家。五区旧警士史锡泰（现在是团员）对群众态度不好，在动员群众买公债及移民工作中方式简单，强迫命令，群众说他是“积极过份”，代表某一类警士的作风。经过领导上和群众的教育，他认识到了自己的错误，在会议中作了深刻的检讨。
    类似以上各种问题的检讨，给了代表们以深刻的印象。大家感到，在共产党的领导下，老百姓真正在政治上、经济上翻了身。有的代表反映：“干部那么忙，生活那么苦，有点小错还要批评检讨，承认错误，不是忠心为人民的干部那能这样作。”
  经过群众性的批评检查  干部都加强了群众观点
    干部们经过广泛的群众性的批评和检查，加强了自己的群众观点及调查研究、深入实际的工作精神，大家感到，今后关起门来办事，愿怎么办就怎么办的作风要不得了。
    在代表会议后，干部对命令主义的缺点普遍的注意和警惕了，对工作比较细致认真了。五区民政科过去军属优待粮分配得不够公平。现在，他们召开军属座谈会，共同研究合理的分配办法。七区区政府在代表会议后，改进工作方法，贯彻各种制度。各科在每星期五的科务会上，总结本周工作，制订下周计划；在每星期六的区务会上，讨论各科工作，处理重大问题，研究干部思想情况。有的科每晚举行接头会，交换意见，计划第二天的工作，第二天一吃过早饭大家就分头去办。动员市民修缮房屋，是该区人民代表会议决定办理的重要工作，区长曾亲自带着干部，向房主、房客解释动员，一般干部也从而学得了工作方法。该区人民亦更加拥护自己的政府，很多代表积极动员或亲自带领群众修缮房屋，注意清洁卫生，为增加民校、夜校奔忙。
  两点重要经验
    根据四个区进行此项工作的经验看来，以下两点是特别重要的：
    （一）在会议前，领导上须注意通过学习文件，检查工作，在干部思想上作充分的准备。开始，有的区对此重视不够，以至有些干部在会议上被动地根据群众的批评进行检讨，就难以收到应有的效果。
    （二）在代表们尚不能畅所欲言、大胆进行批评时，要多作启发。批评开展之后，要注意引向积极改进工作的方向。领导上要使代表们适当地认识工作的成绩与缺点及干部的功过。避免使一部分参加工作时间较短、思想觉悟较差的人员，产生消极情绪。
