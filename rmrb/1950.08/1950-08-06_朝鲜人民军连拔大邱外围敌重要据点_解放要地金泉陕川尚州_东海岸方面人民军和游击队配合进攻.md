The People's Army units attacking towards Gimcheon, in close coordination with the air force detachments of the People's Army, engaged in fierce battles with the US military forces and the remaining troops of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, who had concentrated a large number of troops in the area and were resisting stubbornly with the support of tanks and artillery. As a result, on August 2nd, the People's Army completely liberated Gimcheon County (Note: Gimcheon County is in Gyeongsangbuk-do, 50 kilometers from Daegu), a major military strategic stronghold for the enemy's defense of Daegu. In the battle to liberate Gimcheon, the People's Army dealt a heavy blow to the main force of the US armored division defending the area, captured many enemy soldiers, and seized a large number of spoils of war. Detailed battle results are being tallied.

In the battle to liberate Sangju, the People's Army units inflicted significant losses on the enemy's manpower and military supplies and seized many spoils of war.

The People's Army units on the east coast continued to engage in fierce battles with US military units and the remaining troops of the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

The defeated enemy is carrying out more vicious and indiscriminate bombing and naval shelling of peaceful cities and villages in the rear.

On the 2nd, a US destroyer intruded into the east coast and shelled Jumunjin. It was strongly counterattacked by the People's Army coastal artillery, which controlled the enemy destroyer's movements. The enemy ship was hit by four shells in the middle, lost its balance, and fled in smoke.
