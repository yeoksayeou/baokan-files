　　Beijing City West Moat Adds Sluice Gate to Block Water
　　Over Five Hundred Mu of Farmland Flooded
　　Requesting the Beijing City Sanitation Engineering Bureau to Quickly Investigate
　　Comrade Editor:
　　I have a matter to ask you to resolve. The moat outside Fuxingmen in Beijing has had a sluice gate added to block water, and this has flooded 522 mu of my village's farmland. The course of events is as follows:
　　My village's terrain is very low, and it relies on this river as the only drainage channel for the village's farmland water accumulation. This spring, the government renovated the river channel, making the water flow smoothly, and the masses were very satisfied.
　　When the rainy season came this year, the Beijing City Sanitation Engineering Bureau built a new sluice gate at Xibianmen to adjust the discharge of water volume between the South Moat and the Qian San Men Moat. On July 16th, during heavy rain, in order to prevent the newly built sluice dam project from being washed away, the bureau added sluice gate planks to block water at the old sluice gate upstream, making it impossible to drain the accumulated water from our village's fields. On the 17th, after villagers requested it, a portion of the gate planks were removed, and the accumulated water began to recede.
　　During the heavy rain from August 1st to August 4th, the villagers repeatedly requested to raise the sluice gate to drain the water, but the comrades managing the sluice gate refused on the grounds that they could not execute the order without instructions from higher authorities, and retained seven sluice gate planks, causing 522.2 mu of our village's land to be flooded (including garden land, irrigated land, dry land, and orchard land). Because the crops have been submerged in water for many days, this year's harvest is worrying!
　　On August 4th, villager representatives went to the Beijing City Sanitation Engineering Bureau to request the removal of the planks to release water. After the bureau contacted the local sluice gate watchmen, they believed that removing one or two planks would not cause any accidents, and agreed to first remove one sluice gate plank. However, when we returned to the village in the evening, there was no movement at all. The villagers, fearing that long-term accumulation of rainwater would cause significant damage to the crops, gathered dozens of people and went to remove two sluice gate planks themselves; later, because there was still accumulated water that could not be drained, they removed two more sluice gate planks, allowing the accumulated water to drain away within three hours.
　　According to experienced sluice gate workers in the bureau, in previous years, the sluice gate should have been raised to discharge water long ago at this time, and the downstream would not have suffered the danger of flooding. Now, the gate planks have been added to seven, and the water level will inevitably increase accordingly, and the river water will inevitably overflow the planks as usual. Therefore, the new sluice gate cannot be protected from impact, and the downstream will not be spared from flooding. The disastrous consequences of flooded fields caused by the bureau's blocking of the sluice gate could have been avoided.
　　The villagers' understanding and opinions on this incident are:
　　(1) The bureau should not have built a new sluice gate during the rainy season, causing us unnecessary losses.
　　(2) Since adding seven gate planks could not block the water, they should not have insisted on not raising the gate planks, causing hundreds of mu of our village's farmland to suffer from long-term waterlogging.
　　(3) We request the government to quickly investigate this matter in order to investigate responsibility and give us appropriate compensation.

　　Editor's Note: After receiving the reflection from Village Chief Song Shangchen of this village on this matter, we immediately dispatched a reporter to investigate together with the head of the Management Section and engineers of the Sanitation Engineering Bureau. We believe that the flooding of certain fields in the village is indeed related to the construction of the new sluice gate and the addition of blocking gate planks upstream by the bureau. We hope that the Sanitation Engineering Bureau will immediately check the project plan and appropriately handle this incident.

### 京市西护城河加闸堵水  五百余亩田地被淹  望京市卫生工程局迅速调查

　　京市西护城河加闸堵水
    五百余亩田地被淹
    望京市卫生工程局迅速调查
　　编者同志：
    我有一件事请你解决。即京市复兴门外的护城河因加闸堵水，把我村的田地五百二十二亩都淹没了。事情的经过是这样的：
    我村地势很低，依靠该河为本村农田积水的唯一泄水道。今春政府曾修整河道，使水流畅通，群众都很满意。
    今年雨季来临时，本市卫生工程局在西便门处修建新闸，以调整南护城河与前三门护城河水量的排泄。七月十六日大雨，该局为使新建闸坝工程不致冲毁，在上游旧闸口处加闸板堵水，使本村田园积水无法排出。十七日经村民请求后将闸板撤除一部，积水始退。
    八月一日至八月四日暴雨期间，村民再三请求起闸排水，但管理水闸的同志以上级没有命令不便执行为辞，仍保留闸板七块，使我村土地被淹五二二亩二分（包括园地、水浇地、旱地、果园地）。因禾苗浸水多日，今年收获堪虞！
    八月四日，村民代表赴京市卫生工程局请求起板放水。经该局与当地看闸同志联系后，他们认为起一二块板不致发生意外，乃同意先撤除一块闸板。但我们在傍晚返村后，并不见有何动静。村民以雨水长期淤积，将使作物遭受重大损失，乃集合数十人自行前往起出闸板二块；后因尚有积水未能排泄，又起出闸板两块，使积水在三个钟头内泄完。
    据该局有经验的看闸工人谈：往年此时，早就应提闸泄水，下游不致遭受淹没的危险。而今闸板竟加到七块，水位必随之增加，河水亦必照常越板泄出。因此新闸并不能因此而不受冲击，下游亦不会因此而不遭淹没。该局因堵闸而造成的淹田恶果是可以避免的。
    村民等对此事件的认识和意见是：
    （一）该局不应该在雨季修建新闸，使我们遭受不必要的损失。
    （二）既然增加闸板到七块亦无法堵水，就不应该坚持不提闸板，致使本村数百亩田地长期遭水浸害。
    （三）我们要求政府迅速进行调查此事，以便追究责任，并给我们以适当的补偿。
      北京市第十三区真武庙行政村村长宋尚臣
        八月八日
    编者按：我们接到该村村长宋尚臣对此事的反映后，即派记者会同卫生工程局管理科长及工程师等三人前往调查。认为该村某些田亩被淹确与该局修建新闸而在上游加堵闸板有关。望卫生工程局立即检查工程计划，并适当地处理此一事件。
