From the Experimental Land Reform in Xishui County, Look at the Policy of Preserving the Rich Peasant Economy in the Future
Wang Yongyi

(I)
This spring, the Tuantuan District and Maqiao District of Xishui County, Hubei Province, conducted experimental land reform. Regarding the policy towards rich peasants, they adopted the approach of not touching the land cultivated by the rich peasants themselves and the land cultivated by hired labor, but only collecting the portion they rented out. Now, let's examine the purpose and significance of preserving the rich peasant economy based on materials and work experience from five villages (Taoyuan, Fenshui, Lianqiao, Xialiang, and Yaohu) in Maqiao District.

The five villages of Taoyuan represent land-concentrated villages in the general hilly areas of Hubei Province. Landlords and rich peasants in these five villages accounted for 7.06% of the total population, possessing 55.37% of the land. Among them, landlords accounted for 3.32% of the total population, possessing 45.7% of the land. Rich peasants accounted for 3.74% of the total population, possessing 9.67% of the land (4.56% self-cultivated, 5.11% rented out). Comparing landlords and rich peasants further, the number of rich peasants was greater than the number of landlords, and the land they possessed was about one-fifth of that possessed by the landlords, with their rented portion being less than one-eighth of the landlords' land.

Based on the above situation, a comparison is made between the two situations of collecting rent from rich peasants and not touching the land of rich peasants at all, as shown in the table below:

Village Name | Collecting Rent from Rich Peasants | Completely Not Touching Rich Peasants' Land | Difference
---|---|---|---
 | Average Land per Person | Average Land per Person |
Taoyuan | 4.099 | 3.928 | 0.171
Fenshui | 3.815 | 3.623 | 0.192
Lianqiao | 4.102 | 3.755 | 0.347
Xialiang | 3.295 | 2.949 | 0.346
Yaohu | 3.185 | 2.947 | 0.238
Remarks | 1. Land is calculated based on output, using the "shi" (石) as the unit; land quality is not considered.
 | 2. Landlords and poor peasants are given the same amount of land.
 | 3. Non-agricultural population within the poor peasants is calculated based on the land distribution population.

(II)
From the table above, it can be seen that the difference in the amount of land distributed, whether renting out from rich peasants is touched or not, is not significant. The highest difference is slightly more than three "dou" (斗), and the lowest is slightly more than one "dou," which does not have a major impact on meeting the basic land requirements of poor and hired peasants.

It should also be specifically pointed out that the figures listed in the table above do not include the numbers from "semi-landlord-style rich peasants who rent out a large amount of land, exceeding the amount of land they cultivate themselves and with hired labor, should have their rented land confiscated," nor do they exclude the land from "handicraft workers, small vendors, freelancers and their families in rural areas who should be given a portion of land and other means of production at discretion. However, those whose occupational income is sufficient to regularly maintain their family life may not be given land." On the contrary, they are all counted as households that should be allocated land. According to the statistics of Xialiang Village, this non-agricultural population accounts for 2.3% of the total village population, while in Yaohu Village, it accounts for 11.43% of the total village population. As for the hidden land found after the land reform, it is also not included. Therefore, based on the specific circumstances of the above five villages, if the small amount of rented land of rich peasants is not touched, it is also possible to complete the historical task of land reform and solve the livelihood problems of poor and hired peasants.

(III)
Although this experimental land reform in Xishui was carried out before the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, because it grasped the principle of "not touching the land cultivated by the rich peasants themselves and with hired labor, but only touching the rented portion of land," the process was orderly. It generally neutralized the rich peasants, united the middle peasants, stabilized their production mood, and basically met the requirements of the poor and hired peasants. However, if the policy of principally not touching the rich peasant economy is implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Land Reform Law, the scope of the land reform's attack can be reduced from 7.06% to 3.32%, greatly reducing the resistance in the land reform and proceeding more smoothly and orderly. The experimental land reform proved that, especially in backward villages, landlords often spread rumors and stir up disputes among peasants through rich peasants, inciting middle peasants. This increased the difficulties and resistance to land reform. Now that the Land Reform Law clearly stipulates the policy of principally preserving the rich peasant economy, although it can win over the neutrality of the rich peasants, further isolate the landlords, and reduce the resistance to sabotaging the land reform, the middle peasants can also produce with more peace of mind, and the middle and poor peasants can unite firmly to carry out the land reform.

(IV)
From the reactions of various classes in this experimental land reform, there is a further understanding of the policy of "preserving the rich peasant economy." This approach of only touching the rented land of rich peasants was first well-received by the middle peasants. They eliminated concerns about production. For example, Rao Libing's mother, a middle peasant in Taoyuan Village, said: "Now I can rest assured. We are middle peasants, and there are still people ahead of us (referring to rich peasants)!" Some rich peasants expressed gratitude. Rao Qingfu, a rich peasant in the village, said: "My family has 22 people. I was afraid that if all the land was distributed, we would not be able to live. For a month, I was worried. Now that the self-cultivated land is left for me, I am really relieved. I will definitely produce well when I go back." The production mood of the general rich peasants was also generally stabilized.

The practice of only touching the rented land of rich peasants and not touching anything else (landlords excluded) can generally neutralize rich peasants and unite middle peasants. There is no doubt that implementing this in accordance with the provisions of the Land Reform Law will further reduce the resistance to land reform.

At the same time, according to past experience, the most difficult thing to distinguish when classifying classes is the boundary between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. It is often the case that well-to-do middle peasants are classified as rich peasants, confusing the class ranks in rural areas. With the provisions of the Land Reform Law, this problem is basically solved. It also overcomes the past tendency in land reform to treat landlords and rich peasants equally. It also overcomes the peasants' erroneous idea of absolute egalitarianism in land reform. It can also enable peasants to produce diligently and thriftily without any worries after the land reform and move towards a prosperous life.

In the experimental land reform, only poor peasants, especially hired laborers and the extremely poor, had opinions about not touching the self-cultivated land of rich peasants at the time. However, after propaganda, explanation, and detailed accounting, they generally understood the idea, saying: "Not touching the self-cultivated part of rich peasants is to make them produce and labor," "This way, middle peasants will produce with peace of mind," "The People's Government can also provide loans to help poor and hired peasants produce, so there is no need to worry about not having food to eat."

　　从浠水县的实验土改看今后保存富农经济的政策
    王永毅
    （一）
    今年春天，湖北省浠水县的团坡区与麻桥区试行了土地改革。在对富农的政策上，采取了不动富农自耕和雇人耕种的土地，只征收其出租部分。现在从麻桥区五个村（桃园、分水、莲桥、夏凉、窑湖）的材料及工作体验，来看看保存富农经济的目的和意义。
    桃园等五村代表了湖北省一般丘陵地区的土地集中村。这五个村的地主、富农占总人口的百分之七点零六，共占有土地百分之五十五点三七，其中地主占总人口的百分之三点三二，占有土地百分之四十五点七，富农占总人口的百分之三点七四，占有土地百分之九点六七（自耕为百分之四点五六，出租为百分之五点一一）。再把地主与富农对比一下，富农人数比地主多，占有的土地约为地主占有的五分之一，其出租部分不到地主土地的八分之一。
    根据以上情况，现试将征收富农出租土地与完全不动富农土地两种情况作一比较，列表如下：
   村名  征收富农出租土地   完全不动富农土地   相差数
   每人平均田数  每人平均田数
   桃园  四·○九九    三·九二八   ○·一七一
   分水  三·八一五    三·六二三   ○·一九二
   莲桥  四·一○二    三·七五五   ○·三四七
   夏凉  三·二九五    二·九四九   ○·三四六
   窑湖  三·一八五    二·九四七   ○·二三八
   备考  一、田按产量计算，以石为单位，地不计算在内。
    二、分给地主与贫农同样一份土地。
    三、贫农内非农业人口，按分田人口计算。
   （二）
    从上表看来，动与不动富农的出租土地，分田额相差不大，最高者三斗多，最低者一斗多，这对满足贫、雇农土地的基本要求，无大影响。
    还应特别提出的是，上表中所列数字，还没有把“半地主式的富农出租大量土地，超过其自耕和雇人耕种的土地数量者，应征收其出租的土地”的数字计算在内，也没有把“农村中的手工业工人、小贩、自由职业者及其家属，应酌情分给部分土地和其他生产资料。但其职业收入足以经常维持其家庭生活者，得不分给”的土地除开，相反，都把他们算入了应分田户。而此项非农业人口，据夏凉村统计，占全村人口的百分之二点三，窑湖村则占全村人口的百分之十一点四三。至于土改后查出的黑田，也未计入。因此，根据上述五个村的具体情况，如果不动富农的少量出租土地，也是可以完成土地改革的历史任务，解决贫雇农的生活问题。
    （三）
    浠水这次实验土改，虽然是在土地改革法公布之前进行的，但因为掌握了“不动富农自耕与雇人耕种的土地，只动出租部分土地”的原则，进行中秩序良好，一般中立了富农，团结了中农，并安定了他们的生产情绪，基本上满足了贫雇农的要求。但如果按照土地改革法的规定，原则上不动富农经济的政策，则可使土地改革的打击面，由百分之七点零六，减少到三点三二，大大削减土地改革中的阻力，更有秩序地顺利进行。实验土改中证明，特别是在落后村，地主造谣生事，挑拨农民之间的纠纷，往往是通过富农，煽动中农。这给土地改革增加了困难和阻力。现在土地改革法明文规定原则上保存富农经济，虽然能够争取富农的中立，更加孤立地主，减少破坏土地改革的阻力，同时中农也可以更安心生产，中、贫农巩固地团结起来，进行土地改革。
    （四）
    从这次实验土改中各阶层的反映中，对“保存富农经济”的政策有了进一步的理解。这次只动富农出租土地的作法，首先获得中农的良好反映。他们消除了生产上的顾虑。如桃园村中农饶利兵的母亲说：“现在我可放心了，我们是中农，前面还有人（指富农）哩！”有的富农则表示感激。该村富农饶清富说：“我一家有二十二口人，怕把田都分出去没法生活，一个月来提心吊胆，这一下把自耕田给我留下，我真放心了，我回去一定好好生产。”一般富农的生产情绪，也都大体安定。
    只动富农出租土地，其余一概不动（地主在外）的作法，尚可一般中立富农，团结中农，今后按土地改革法的规定执行，毫无疑义地会更加减少土地改革的阻力。
    同时，根据过去的经验，在划阶级时，最难分清的是富农与富裕中农的界限，往往将富裕中农划为富农，混乱农村的阶级阵营。随着土地改革法的规定，这一问题便基本解决了。并克服了以往土地改革中，对地主、富农一律看待的偏向。也克服了农民在土地改革中的绝对平均主义的错误想法。并可使农民在土改后，更无顾虑地勤俭生产，走向生活富裕的道路。
    在实验土改中，当时只有贫农尤其是雇工赤贫，对不动富农自耕部分的土地有意见。但经过宣传、解释、算细账之后，一般也打通了思想，说：“不动富农自耕部分，是为了叫他生产劳动”，“这样中农会安心生产了”，“人民政府还可贷款，协助贫雇农生产，不愁没饭吃”。
