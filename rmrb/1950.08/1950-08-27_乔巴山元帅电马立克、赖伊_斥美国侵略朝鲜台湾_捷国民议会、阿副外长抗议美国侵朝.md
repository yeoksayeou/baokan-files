Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: According to TASS, Ulaanbaatar, August 25th: Marshal Choibalsan, Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, cabled Malik, Chairman of the United Nations Security Council, and Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, condemning the United States' aggression against Korea and Chinese Taiwan. The cable stated: The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic fully supports all the proposals of the Soviet Government for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, that is, the representative of the People's Republic of China must participate in the Security Council meeting to discuss the Korean question, and representatives of the Korean people should be invited to attend; the Korean War should be ended immediately, and foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea.

The cable, after condemning the atrocities committed by the American aggressor troops against the peace-loving Korean people, stated: The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic hopes that the United Nations Organization will meet the expectations of the people of the world, fulfill its responsibilities, and take timely and effective measures in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to end the crime of aggression against Korea and maintain peace and security.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: TASS, Tirana, August 26th: The Albanian Telegraph Agency reported: Priviti, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Albania, on the order of the Albanian government, cabled Malik, Chairman of the Security Council. The cable stated: "The Government of the People's Republic of Albania expresses its deep anger at the United States' shameless intervention in Korea and firmly protests against these criminal acts of the American imperialist government. The open aggression against the peace-loving Korean people, which the United States had long been scheming to prepare, is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and constitutes the most serious crime against world peace."

The cable then pointed out that the US military intervention in Korea and the obstructionist attitude adopted by the US representative attending the Security Council towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, once again demonstrates the US government's policy of inciting war.

The cable stated: "The Government of the People's Republic of Albania firmly supports the proposal made by the Soviet delegation on August 4 in the Security Council, namely: to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China, to listen to the opinions of the representatives of the Korean people, to stop the war, and at the same time to withdraw foreign troops from Korea." The same cable was also sent to UN Secretary-General Lie.

Priviti also sent another cable to Malik on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, protesting against the inhuman bombing of Korean civilians by the US Air Force, and expressing support for the Soviet representative's proposal on August 8, 1950 in the Security Council to prohibit the inhumane and barbaric bombing of Korean civilians and residential areas.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: TASS, Prague, August 25th: The Presidium of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic cabled the United Nations Security Council, on behalf of the Czech and Slovak peoples, strongly protesting against the United States' armed attack on the peace-loving Korean people, and protesting against the US aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of non-military targets and undefended cities, as well as the systematic destruction of cultural, artistic, social and other similar institutions and cultural relics.

The cable declared: The people of Czechoslovakia demand a peaceful resolution of the Korean War in accordance with the proposal of Malik, Chairman of the Security Council. Therefore, the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic, representing the people of the whole country, urges the United Nations Security Council to take all necessary measures to end the Korean War as soon as possible, clearly condemn the imperialist aggression launched by the United States, and listen to the opinions of the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社乌兰巴托尔二十五日讯：蒙古人民共和国总理乔巴山元帅致电联合国安全理事会主席马立克及联合国秘书长赖伊，斥责美国侵略朝鲜及中国的台湾。电文称：蒙古人民共和国政府完全拥护苏联政府关于和平解决朝鲜问题的一切建议，即在联合国安全理事会会议讨论朝鲜问题时，必须有中华人民共和国代表参加，并邀请朝鲜人民代表出席；应立即终止朝鲜战争，并应将外国军队撤出朝鲜。
    电文于斥责美国侵略军对爱好和平的朝鲜人民所进行的暴行后称：蒙古人民共和国政府希望联合国组织满足全世界人民的期望，履行其职责，并遵照联合国宪章采取及时而有效的措施，以终止侵略朝鲜的罪行，维护和平与安全。

    电文继而指出：美军干涉朝鲜与美国出席安全理事会代表对和平解决朝鲜问题所采取的阻挠态度，再度显示了美国政府以煽动战争为目的的政策。

    普里夫蒂同时代表阿尔巴尼亚人民共和政府拍给马立克的另一电报，抗议美国空军绝灭人性地轰炸朝鲜平民，并表示支持一九五○年八月八日苏联代表在安全理事会提出的关于禁止惨无人道和野蛮地轰炸朝鲜平民与住宅区的建议。

    电文宣称：捷克斯洛伐克人民要求依照安全理事会主席马立克的建议，和平解决朝鲜战事。因此，捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会代表全国人民，敦促联合国安全理事会采取一切必要措施，早日终止朝鲜战争，明白指责美国所发动的帝国主义侵略，并听取朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的意见。
