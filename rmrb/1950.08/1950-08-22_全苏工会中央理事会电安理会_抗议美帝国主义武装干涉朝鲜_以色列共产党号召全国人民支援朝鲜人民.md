　　Xinhua News Agency, August 21st dispatch from Moscow via TASS: The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions telegraphed the United Nations Security Council on the 19th, protesting against the U.S. imperialist armed intervention in Korea, indiscriminately bombing Korean cities and villages, and barbarously massacring peaceful Korean residents. The cable pointed out: The workers and staff of the Soviet Union, like millions of honest people around the world, deeply understand that the U.S. government should be responsible for the massacre of the thousands upon thousands of old people, women, and children in Korea. The cable requested the Security Council: "1. Condemn the U.S. government's aggression against Korea; 2. Immediately order the U.S. government to stop the cruel bombing by the U.S. Air Force, as well as other means of destroying Korean cities and villages and massacring peaceful residents; 3. Adopt a resolution to immediately stop the U.S. armed intervention in Korea and for all foreign troops to immediately withdraw from Korea."
    Xinhua News Agency, August 17th dispatch from Tel Aviv via TASS on the 16th: The Israeli newspaper *Kol HaAm* published an appeal from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Israel to all the people of Israel, calling on them to support the organization of medical relief movements to aid the Korean people who are suffering due to U.S. imperialist aggression.
    The appeal said: "The people of Israel, Jews and Arabs, express their support for the struggle of the Korean people to win national independence and to liberate themselves from the shackles of U.S. imperialism."
    The appeal concluded by urging the people to intensify protest movements, "protesting against the terrorist bombings of U.S. imperialism in Korea, and protesting against the Ben-Gurion government's assistance to the U.S. aggressors in the Far East."
