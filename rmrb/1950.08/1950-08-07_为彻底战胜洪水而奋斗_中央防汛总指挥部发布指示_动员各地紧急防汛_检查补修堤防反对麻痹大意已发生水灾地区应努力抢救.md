Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Central Flood Control Headquarters today issued instructions regarding flood control work. The full text is as follows:

Since the beginning of the flood season, rivers across the country have been rising successively. Flood control organizations at all levels have worked hard to rescue and have achieved certain results. However, many areas have experienced flooding or breaches. Among them, the northern Anhui region in the Huai River basin is mainly due to concentrated rainfall and excessive flooding, exceeding the safe guarantee limit. Other floods in various regions are due to individual projects not meeting standards, a lack of serious pre-flood inspection, or undiscovered gaps; some are due to complacency and negligence in defense, with the leadership not giving due attention; and some are due to the leadership not being strict enough, the projects not being completed in time, and flood control preparations not being adequate, or the plugging being untimely. For example, the breach at Laogaozhai on the Jiyun River in Hebei was because the plugging project below the mouth of the Chaobai River's new channel was originally scheduled to be completed in early July, but was delayed until the arrival of the flood on the 18th, and was not yet completed, resulting in a large amount of floodwater still being discharged by the Jiyun River, causing a breach and flooding sixty-nine villages. Furthermore, the breaches at Daxinzhuang and Xiaoyantai on the Beisha River in Liaodong Province were both due to the projects not being up to standard and the failure to listen to the correct opinions of the masses, resulting in breaches when the floods came. Again, since the beginning of the flood season in Zhejiang Province, it has been reported that more than 600,000 mu of land have been flooded. The main reason is that they were busy with drought prevention before the flood season and neglected flood control, and the inspection of projects was not timely, resulting in a panic when the floods came. After the Pujiang River washed away 38 kilometers of railway in Zhuji County, the local government conducted an inspection, and as a result, they found twelve serious dangerous works within sixty li, which could cause disasters at any time. Other similar incidents have occurred in the upper reaches of the Huai River tributaries in Henan Province, the Yongding River in Anci County, Hebei Province, the Xin River in Jiangxi, the Han River in Hanchuan, Hubei, as well as Baotou in Suiyuan, Xiangtan in Hunan, and Chongqing and Huayang in Sichuan, causing varying degrees of damage. The disaster situation in some areas is still developing, and in some areas, the disaster situation is more serious than last year (Huai River). If the flood control leading organs in various regions do not pay close attention, learn lessons in time, and earnestly improve their work, then not only will the task of guaranteeing that about 70 million mu of land will not be flooded under the same flood conditions as last year not be completed, but also there will be no reliable guarantee in overcoming the continuation of the disaster. This is what we should pay attention to as soon as possible.

Under the current circumstances, flood control agencies at all levels should be vigilant, overcome pride and impetuosity, not only consolidate existing achievements, but also try to eliminate factors that may cause disasters. We must oppose complacency and wishful thinking. After heavy rains and floods, we must conduct major inspections and repairs of embankments at any time, and more thoroughly inspect rat holes and badger dens to eliminate hidden dangers; repeatedly study flood control instructions, truly achieve full-line defense and key points, strengthen segmented responsibility, and truly grasp the water situation, study the laws, and strengthen upstream and downstream connections, so as to prepare for protection in time. In the process of flood control, if it is found that the patrol sheds are lacking, they should be increased; those that cannot avoid strong winds and rain should be repaired; those that lack materials or have not been prepared at all, and those that have been prepared but have been used for emergency rescue, should be supplemented according to the specific situation. Where the embankment body has been tested and found to be weak and unable to resist greater floods, effective compensation should be given. In places with great danger, preparations should be made in advance to avoid drowning and other unnecessary losses. In areas where disasters have already occurred, in addition to extracting a part of the force to carry out the plugging of breaches, drainage of accumulated water, replanting of late rice, and relief of disaster victims, the majority of the force must still be used for flood control to prevent the expansion of the disaster area and the occurrence of new disasters. In leadership, on the one hand, we must take care of the overall situation, and at the same time, we must grasp the key points, and oppose the two deviations of not taking care of the overall situation, only concentrating on one point, and using forces equally. Now that half of the flood season is about to pass, as long as our flood control agencies at all levels can rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and organize the masses, vigorously publicize the importance of flood control, and guide flood control methods to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses, and be careful and prevent sabotage by enemy agents and the theft of embankments for personal gain by individual backward elements, our flood control tasks can be completed and must be completed. It is hoped that flood control agencies at all levels will take more active action and strive to thoroughly overcome the floods. Strive for the great turnaround of the peasant economy in New China and the end of the continuation of disasters.

　　为彻底战胜洪水而奋斗
    中央防汛总指挥部发布指示
    动员各地紧急防汛
    检查补修堤防反对麻痹大意已发生水灾地区应努力抢救
    【新华社六日讯】中央防汛总指挥部今日发布关于防汛工作的指示。全文如下：
    全国各河，自入汛以来，先后涨水。各级防汛组织，努力抢救，已经获得了一定的成绩；但仍有不少地区，发生了漫溢或溃决。其中除淮河流域皖北地区，主要系因降雨量集中，洪水过大，超过安全保证限度者外，其余各地水灾，有的是由于个别工程做的不合标准，汛前未曾认真检查，或留有缺口未曾发现；有的是由于麻痹大意，疏于防守，领导上未予以应有的重视；也有的是由于领导上抓得不紧，工程未能及时完成，及防汛准备工作未做好，或抢堵不及时所致。如河北蓟运河老高寨决口，即因该河在潮白河新河道口门以下的堵口工程，原决定七月初完成，但延至十八日大水到来，尚未完成，致大量洪水，仍由蓟运河下泄，发生决口，淹村六十九个。又如辽东省北沙河大新庄及小烟台两处决口，均因工程做的不够标准，又未听取群众正确意见，致洪水一来，发生决口。再如浙江省自入汛以后，据报已淹地六十余万亩，主要原因是在汛前忙于防旱，疏于防汛，对工程检查亦不及时，致大水一来，手忙脚乱。浦阳江在诸暨县冲毁铁路三十八公里之后，当地政府才进行检查，结果在六十华里内即发现十二处严重险工，随时有发生灾害之可能。其他如河南省淮河上游各支流，河北省安次县之永定河，江西之信江，湖北汉川之汉江以及绥远之包头，湖南之湘潭，四川之崇庆、华阳等地，亦均有以上类似事件发生，造成了轻重不同的灾害。有的地区灾情尚在发展，有的地区灾情较去年更为严重（淮河）。各地防汛领导机关，如不高度注意，及时地接受教训，切实改进工作，则不但在与去年同等洪水情况下，保证约七千万亩土地不被水淹的任务将不能完成，同时在克服灾荒的延续方面，也将没有可靠把握。这是我们应该及早注意的。
    在目前情况下，各级防汛机关，应该提高警惕，戒骄戒躁，不惟巩固已有的成绩，并应设法消除可能招致灾害的因素。要反对麻痹大意与侥幸心理。在大水大雨之后，要随时进行堤防大检查与修补，更深入地检查鼠穴獾洞，消除隐患；反复研究防汛指示，真正做到全线防守重点，加强分段负责，并确实地掌握水情，研究规律，加强上下游联系，以便及时准备防护。在防汛过程中，发觉巡堤窝铺缺少的地方，应增加；不能避大风雨的应修补；材料不足或根本未准备，以及虽准备但已因抢险用去一部者，要根据具体情况，进行补充。堤身经过考验，发现薄弱的地方，不能抵抗更大洪水者，要予以有效的弥补。在危险性很大的地方，要事先有准备地避免发生淹死人的事件，与其他不应有的损失。在已经发生灾害的地方，除抽出一部分力量，有条件地进行堵复决口，排除积水，抢种晚秧，救济灾民外，仍需以大部力量，进行防汛，防止灾区的扩大与新的灾害发生。在领导上一方面要照顾全局，同时要抓住重点，反对不照顾全局，只集中一点与平均使用力量的两种偏向。现汛期将过一半，只要我们各级防汛机关，能依靠群众，发动群众，组织群众，大力宣传防汛的重要，并指导防汛方法，以发挥群众的积极性，并小心谨慎，防止敌特分子的破坏与个别落后分子为一己私利偷堤放水的事项，我们的防汛任务，是可以完成也必须完成的。希各级防汛机关，更积极地行动起来，为彻底战胜洪水而奋斗。为新中国的农民经济大翻身与灾荒不再延续而奋斗。
