　　PLA Unit Renovating the Baoji-Tianshui Railway
    Completes 3 Million Cubic Meters of Earthwork
    One of the Three Major Dangerous Projects Successfully Completed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 1st Dispatch] Since the People's Liberation Army unit began renovating the Baoji-Tianshui Railway in early April, it had completed nearly 3 million cubic meters of earthwork by the end of July, accounting for 36 percent of the total earthwork.

    The Baoji-Tianshui Railway is 153 kilometers long, running through the steep mountainside of the Qinling Mountains. The roadbed is steep and narrow. When renovating the roadbed on cliffs, the commanders and fighters often used ropes and iron chains to secure their waists, and used picks and shovels with wooden handles more than one zhang long to open up steps for themselves from top to bottom. Seventy-six kilometers from Baoji, it is one of the three major dangerous projects on the road, with a slope of more than 500 meters, which often collapses and causes rockfalls that injure people. During the Kuomintang rule, hundreds of workers were involved in emergency repairs here, but the problem of collapse was never resolved. The PLA road construction unit invested five companies in this section of the project, carefully arranged safety precautions, organized safety observation posts, and formulated safety agreements. In the past three months, only two minor injuries have occurred, and the section has been completed without any further collapses.

    During the renovation, all commanders and fighters generally launched a wave of technical research. With the spirit of "learning while working," the soldiers humbly learned from the engineers; from the division to the company level, visiting groups and study groups were organized to learn from other units and gain experience. Each unit also held "Zhuge Liang Meetings" every day to exchange experiences. Various units have created more than ten kinds of transportation tools, such as high-line earth transportation racks, wooden-wheeled hand carts, and earth-lifting poles, which greatly improved work efficiency. For example, a total of more than 800,000 cubic meters of earthwork was completed in April and May, and 1.1 million cubic meters were completed in July.

　　整修宝天路解放军某部
    完成土石工程三百万公方
    三大险工之一顺利修竣
    【新华社西安一日电】人民解放军某部自四月初开工整修宝（鸡）天（水）铁路以来，至七月底，已完成土石方工程近三百万公方，占全部土石方工程百分之三十六。
    宝天路长一五三公里，全线穿经险峻的秦岭山腰，路基陡窄。指战员们在悬崖绝壁处整修路基时，常以绳索铁链缚住腰部，用装有一丈余长木柄的镐、铲、自上而下地打开容身的阶梯。离宝鸡七十六公里处，是该路三大险工之一，坡高五百余公尺，经常倒塌，滚石伤人。国民党统治时期先后有数百工人在此抢修，塌方问题始终未能解决。解放军修路部队以五个连队投入该段工程，严密布置防险工作，组织防险观察哨，订出防险公约。三个月来仅发生两名轻伤，即修竣该段，未再发生塌方事件。
    全体指战员在整修中，普遍展开研究技术的热潮。战士们以“边作边学”的精神，虚心向工程师学习；由师至班都组织了参观团和留洋组，到其他单位学习，取得经验。各单位并每天召开“诸葛亮会”，相互交流经验。各部共创造了高线运土架、木轮手车、吊土杆等十余种运输工具，大大地提高了工作效率。如四、五月份共完成土石方工程八十余万公方，七月份达一百一十万公方。
