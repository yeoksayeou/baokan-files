　　Dalian Municipal Government Begins Rectification Campaign
　　Reviewing Departmentalism and Bureaucracy
　　[Our Newspaper News] *Luda People's Daily* reports: The Dalian Municipal People's Government began a rectification campaign on July 25th and has preliminarily examined past work. Mayor Mao Da-xun, Deputy Mayor Zhu Xin-yang, and heads of various departments of the Municipal Government first examined the implementation of policies with a spirit of self-criticism and mutual criticism, and focused on reviewing leadership styles. All comrades launched a heated discussion based on Mayor Mao's inspection report and put forward several supplementary opinions.

　　Based on the examination of various tasks, the municipal government leadership lacked an overall concept centered on industrial production. The municipal government believed that it did not directly control production and had little relationship with production, so it did not carry out all its work around industrial production. For example, in terms of hygiene work, the Northeast People's Government repeatedly emphasized the importance of factory hygiene work, but the municipal government believed that factories were directly managed by the Luda Administrative Office, and the municipal hospital had limited strength to take care of everything, so it had never intervened in factory hygiene until 1949. In terms of municipal construction, the municipal government also did not do enough to facilitate and develop production. For example, the road between Ganjingzi and Zhoushuizi Village had been damaged for a long time, causing many inconveniences to the transportation work of major enterprises, but the municipal government believed that this was the responsibility of the Transportation Department of the Luda Administrative Office, and it did not repair it or actively take responsibility for contacting the Transportation Department to urge its early repair. In terms of housing management, planning was not thorough, and worker housing was not properly adjusted. For example, some workers at the Dalian Machinery Factory in Shahekou lived in Laohutan, far from the factory, while some houses in Shahekou were allocated to vendors during housing adjustments. In terms of cultural and educational work, the municipal government only led the literacy campaign for ordinary citizens, while neglecting the leadership of worker literacy, believing that workers had a trade union and did not need the municipal government to be responsible. The distribution of primary schools in the city was also unreasonable, with most schools concentrated in the city center and few schools in workers' residential areas. In terms of the implementation of labor policies, the municipal government also failed to persuade and correct in a timely manner some capitalists who ignored the interests of workers and made improper demands on workers.

　　Regarding leadership style, everyone examined and found that there was bureaucracy and commandism in the leadership. This is specifically manifested in: 1. Lack of planning. For example, although there were plans for municipal construction, they were not implemented according to the plan. The damaged roads that were originally scheduled to be repaired last year have not yet been repaired, mainly because the objective difficulties were not correctly estimated when the plan was made. Another example is that various districts spent a lot of manpower and material resources last year to run training classes for accounting, nursing, hairdressing, etc. The original plan was to introduce jobs to the students after graduation, but later the training classes collapsed halfway, and the plan to introduce jobs to the students was not realized. 2. Leading cadres do not go deep into their work and do not have enough contact with the lower levels. Not only did the mayor not have a deep understanding of the specific situation at the lower levels, but even the bureau chiefs were not clear about it. After the work was deployed, there was a lack of inspection, and only reports were listened to. There were even fewer occasions where the head of the department talked to lower-level cadres individually to understand the situation, and even the names of individual section chiefs in the municipal government were not familiar. The masses had opinions on the work style of cadres in cooperatives and hospitals, but the municipal government did not conduct in-depth inspections and correct them in a timely manner. When the cadre section transferred cadres, it did not consider or did not consider the opinions of the lower levels, so the transferred cadres often did not meet the requirements, and some cadres were sent back after being transferred to new positions, causing dissatisfaction among the transferred cadres. 3. Some cadres have a serious style of being divorced from the masses. For example, when Xiaopingdao District sent grain to the Municipal Materials Section, it was raining, but the comrades in the Materials Section, because it was ten minutes after office hours, ignored them and the grain being rained on, and told them to wait two hours before unloading. 4. There are also phenomena of unclear responsibilities and unclear division of labor in some departments. For example, the leadership problem of cooperatives in various districts has not been resolved. The trade union, the CCP district committee, the Luda Cooperative General Agency, and the Municipal Cooperative Guidance Section all lead the cooperatives, but it is not clearly stipulated who should be responsible, resulting in a phenomenon of no one being responsible. When handling certain issues, the various departments of the municipal government sometimes had inconsistent opinions due to a lack of close contact and coordination. For example, when signing collective labor contracts, the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Labor Bureau both went to hold meetings, making the factory overwhelmed.

　　Based on the preliminary review, everyone believes that first of all, in terms of leadership ideology, it is necessary to recognize that all work of the municipal government must be more actively and proactively closely linked to the economic construction work of the Luda region, especially industrial construction work, establish an overall ideology centered on industrial production, and strictly criticize the narrow departmentalism ideology of "not taking care of things that are not directly under the jurisdiction of the municipal government"; correct the irresponsible attitude of wanting to take ready-made paths and not actively solving problems. Second, strengthen organizational leadership. First of all, the work of the Party group and the Administrative Committee should be improved. The two should hold regular meetings and clearly divide labor so that the Party group can play the role of a powerful engine. Strengthening leadership and contact with cadres and the masses should be raised to a top priority, and close contact should be maintained between the administration and the branch and mass organizations to ensure the completion of administrative tasks. At the same time, strengthen the unified planning and mutual coordination of the work of various departments, and make the plan practical, establish a division of labor and responsibility system, and improve various systems to ensure the completion of the plan.

### 大连市府开始整风  检讨本位主义与官僚主义

　　大连市府开始整风
    检讨本位主义与官僚主义
    【本报讯】旅大人民日报消息：大连市人民政府于七月二十五日开始整风，已初步检查了过去的工作。毛达恂市长、朱新阳副市长和市府各部门负责人，首先以自我批评与互相批评的精神，检查了政策执行情况，并着重检讨了领导作风。全体同志根据毛市长的检查报告，展开了热烈的讨论，提出了若干补充意见。
    根据各项工作的检查，市府领导上缺乏以工业生产为中心的整体观念。市府曾以为本身没有直接掌握生产，与生产关系不大，所以没有把一切工作都围绕着工业生产进行。如卫生工作方面，东北人民政府一再强调重视工厂卫生工作，但市府认为工厂是旅大行署直接管理的，市立医院力量有限，难以兼顾，因此到一九四九年一直没有过问工厂卫生。在市政建设上，市府对如何便利与发展生产，也做得不够。如甘井子至周水村之间的公路破坏已久，对各大企业的运输工作有许多不便，但市府认为这是划归了旅大行署交通厅负责的工作，没有去修理，也没有积极负责与交通厅联络，促其早日补修。在房产管理上，计划不周，没有适当地照顾调整工人住宅。如沙河口大连机械工厂有的工人住在离厂很远的老虎滩，而调剂住宅时却把沙河口一部分住宅调剂给了小贩。在文化教育工作上，市府只领导了一般市民的识字运动，而忽视了工人识字的领导，认为工人有总工会，不需要市府负责。市里小学校的分布也不合理，大部分学校集中在市中心区，而工人住宅区学校很少。在执行劳动政策方面，对于某些忽视工人利益和对工人有不正当要求的资方，市府也未及时加以说服和纠正。
    关于领导作风方面，大家检查出领导上存在着官僚主义和命令主义。具体表现在：一、缺乏计划性。如市政建设虽然有计划，但没有照计划做。原订在去年修好破坏的马路，至今仍迟迟未修好，主要原因是订计划时没有正确估计客观困难。又如各区去年曾花费不少人力物力来举办会计、护士、理发等训练班，原计划结业后为学员分别介绍职业，但后来训练班中途垮台，给学员介绍职业的计划没有实现。二、领导干部工作不深入，与下层联系不够。对下层的具体情况，不仅市长深入了解不够，就是局长也不清楚。工作布置以后缺乏检查，单听汇报。首长找下层干部个别谈话了解情况更少，甚至对市政府内个别科长的名字也有不熟悉的。群众对合作社、医院干部作风有意见，而市府没有深入检查及时纠正。干部科在调动干部时，不大考虑或没有考虑下面的意见，因此调的干部往往不符合要求，有的干部调到新工作岗位后又被送回去，引起被调干部的不满。三、部分干部有严重的脱离群众的作风。如小平岛区向市府物资科送粮食时天在下雨，而物资科同志因为过了办公时间十分钟，就不管他们及粮食受雨淋，叫等两个钟头后再卸。四、某些部门还有职责不清，分工不明的现象。如对各区合作社的领导问题就没有解决。工会、中共区委、旅大合作总社、市府合作指导科都领导合作社，但究竟应由谁负责，没有明确规定，结果弄成无人负责的现象。市府各部门在处理某些问题时，由于联系配合不紧密，有时意见不一致。如签订劳资集体合同时，工商局去召开会议，劳动局也去召开会议，使厂方应接不暇。
    根据初步检讨，大家认为首先在领导思想上必须认识市府的一切工作要更积极更主动地和旅大地区的经济建设工作特别是工业建设工作紧密地联系起来，树立以工业生产为中心的整体思想，严格地批判那种“以为不是直接归市府管的事就不管”的狭隘的本位主义思想；纠正希图走现成道路，不主动解决问题的不负责任的态度。第二，加强组织领导，首先应健全党组和行政委员会的工作，二者定期开会，明确分工，使党组发挥有力的发动机的作用。应把加强领导与干部和群众的联系提到首要地位，密切行政与支部和群众团体的联系，以保证行政任务的完成。同时，加强各部门工作的统一计划和互相配合，并使计划切合实际，建立分工负责制，健全各种制度，以保证计划的完成。
