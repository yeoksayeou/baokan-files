The "First National Health Conference" jointly convened by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Health of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government opened in Beijing on the 7th. The conference will review the implementation of the guidelines determined by the National Health Administration Conference convened by the People's Revolutionary Military Commission last year, summarize past experiences, and formulate the general guidelines and tasks for national health work in the future. The following key issues will be the focus of discussion at this conference: (1) To exchange views more widely on the health work principle of "prevention first" in order to implement it. (2) To unite and reform traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, requiring "the scientification of Chinese medicine and the sinicization of Western medicine."

(4) To promote that health and pharmaceutical work should face the countryside, face industry and mining, and take care of ethnic minorities.
    Approximately seven hundred representatives from the central government and the North China, Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central South, Southwest regions, and the military system, as well as specially invited representatives, attended the conference. These included health workers from various departments such as medicine, pharmaceuticals, public health, health education, midwifery and nursing, health administration, and traditional Chinese medicine.
