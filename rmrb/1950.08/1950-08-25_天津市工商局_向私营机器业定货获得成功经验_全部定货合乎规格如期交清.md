    Successfully Obtains Orders from Private Machinery Industry
    All Orders Conform to Specifications and are Delivered on Schedule
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd] How can private enterprises be made to do a good job of fulfilling orders? The method adopted by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce in fulfilling the task assigned by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry to place orders with the city's machinery industry is a successful experience. After the Ministry of Heavy Industry assigned an initial batch of 300 sets of railway signal machines to Tianjin's machinery industry this summer, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce immediately convened a meeting of the machinery industry to allocate the orders. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce emphasized that only by making efforts to do a good job of fulfilling this batch of orders could credit be obtained for continuing to undertake large-scale orders in the future. The meeting decided that this batch of signal machines would be manufactured by 28 factories with appropriate equipment under the Machinery Industry United Manufacturing Factory, and each factory would subcontract a portion of the parts to other factories with poorer conditions. On the other hand, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce also cooperated with relevant departments to assist the industry's trade union in holding meetings to mobilize workers to discuss how to ensure the quality of the orders made and deliver them on schedule based on contract requirements and the specific conditions of each factory. During the manufacturing process, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the United Manufacturing Factory established a strict inspection system to sample products at any time, test quality, solve technical problems, and exchange experiences among factories. On the other hand, workers also experimented while producing to check for any cutting corners. As a result, all signal machines were delivered on schedule and met the specifications.
    In contrast, when a certain military region in Tianjin ordered more than 570,000 pairs of rubber shoes from the Tianjin rubber industry in May this year, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce did not allocate orders based on the technical and credit conditions of each factory, nor did it mobilize workers through the trade union to supervise production and urge each other to prevent material reduction and corner-cutting. Furthermore, the factories undertaking the orders had technical conservatism and were unwilling to exchange experiences with each other. Therefore, many rubber shoes were found to be inconsistent with the specifications stipulated in the contract when they were delivered. For example, the soles of shoes made by Sanheyi, Dalu, and Dongchang factories cracked when folded. The shoes made by Zhenzhong and other factories became degummed when pressed by hand. The shoes made by Dachina factory looked beautiful on the surface, but after cutting open the soles, it was found that the soles were very thin and easily cracked. As a result, not only did the military region suffer losses, but the Tianjin rubber industry also suffered great losses in reputation and income.

　　天津市工商局
    向私营机器业定货获得成功经验
    全部定货合乎规格如期交清
    【新华社天津二十三日电】怎样才能使私营企业把定货做好？天津市人民政府工商局执行中央人民政府重工业部的分配任务向该市机器业定货的办法就是一个成功的经验。在今夏重工业部分配首批定货三百套铁道号志机给天津机器业后，市工商局即召开机器业会议分配定货。工商局曾着重指出只有努力作好这批定货才能取得以后继续承做大批定货的信用。会议决定这批号志机由机器业联合制造厂下属二十八家有适当设备的工厂承制，并由承制各厂分一部分零件给其他条件较差的工厂做。另一方面工商局又会同有关部门协助该业工会举行会议，发动工人讨论如何根据合同要求和各厂具体情况保证所作定货的质量并按期交货。工商局在制造过程中，联合制造厂建立了严格的检查制度，随时抽查产品，实验品质，解决技术上的问题，交流各厂经验。另一方面，工人也在生产中一边做一边实验，以检查是否有偷工减料情形。结果全部号志机如期交货，并且都合乎规格。
    与此相反，今年五月某军区向津市橡胶业定制五十七万余双胶鞋时，就没有通过工商局根据各厂技术和信誉的条件来分配定货，也没有通过工会发动工人来监督生产和互相督促，以防止减料和偷工，而承制定货的各厂又存在着技术保守思想，彼此不肯交流经验，因此交货时被验出许多胶鞋不合于合同所规定的规格。如三合义、大陆、东昌等厂作的鞋底一折就裂。震中等厂作的鞋用手一按就脱胶。大中华作的鞋表面很漂亮，而割开底子后就发现底子非常单薄，容易折裂。结果不仅该军区受到损失，津市橡胶业在信誉和收入上也受到很大损失。
