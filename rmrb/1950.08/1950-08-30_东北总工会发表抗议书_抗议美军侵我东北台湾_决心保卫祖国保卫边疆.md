Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 29th: The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions has issued a protest against the U.S. imperialist aggression in Northeast China. The full text is as follows:

　　The military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean army intruded into our Northeast airspace five times in a single day, strafing buildings, stations, and vehicles, killing and wounding 21 of our workers and residents, and killing three. This is a brutal crime against the entire working class and people of Northeast China! U.S. imperialism is conspiring to extend its aggressive claws into Northeast China to expand its aggression! The people and working class of the entire Northeast should rise up in unison, heighten their vigilance a hundredfold, and make full preparations to resist the U.S. military's acts of aggression against Northeast China and Taiwan! Defend the Motherland, defend the border, and defend our economic construction.

　　The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government has, on behalf of the 475 million people of the country, lodged a serious protest with the U.S. government and filed accusations and recommendations with the United Nations Security Council. Our entire working class in Northeast China expresses our firm support! The U.S. government must immediately punish the U.S. Air Force for this provocative and brutal act and be responsible for compensating for all losses suffered by our country. In order to maintain peace and security in Asia and the world and prevent the situation from escalating, the U.S. government must immediately withdraw its invading troops from Korea.

　　Finally, we express our condolences to the three workers who sacrificed their lives under the brutal attack of U.S. imperialism, and extend our sincere condolences to the wounded train driver, the other 20 workers and residents, and the families of the deceased. Our Northeast working class will surely avenge you and demand a blood debt from the U.S. imperialists.

　　东北总工会发表抗议书
    抗议美军侵我东北台湾
    决心保卫祖国保卫边疆
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】东北总工会为美帝国主义侵略我东北的行为发出抗议书。全文如下：
    美国侵略朝鲜军队的军用飞机，竟一日五次侵入我东北领空，扫射建筑物、车站、车辆，杀伤我工人居民二十一人，死三人。这是对我全东北工人阶级和人民的残暴罪行！美帝国主义正在阴谋把它的侵略魔爪伸进东北，来扩大侵略！全东北人民和工人阶级应一致奋起，百倍提高警惕，进行充分准备，反抗美国军队对于我国东北和台湾两地的侵略行为！保卫祖国，保卫边疆，保卫我们的经济建设。
    中央人民政府外交部已经代表全国四万七千五百万人民，向美国政府提出严重抗议，向联合国安全理事会提出控诉和建议，我们全东北工人阶级表示坚决的拥护！美国政府必须立即惩办美国空军此次挑衅和残暴行为，负责赔偿我国方面所受的一切损失。为了保持亚洲和世界的和平与安全，防止事态扩大，美国政府必须立即从朝鲜撤退其侵略军队。
    最后我们谨向牺牲在美帝国主义残暴袭击下的三名工人致哀，向负伤的火车司机，其他二十名工人和居民，及死难工人家属致以亲切的慰问。我们东北工人阶级，一定为你们报仇，向美帝国主义者讨还血债。
