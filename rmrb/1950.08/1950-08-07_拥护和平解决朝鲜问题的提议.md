Due to the imperialist bloc's efforts to sabotage and obstruct in every possible way, the current United Nations Security Council has had to proceed with its agenda at an extremely slow pace.

From the intense debates in the Security Council over the past few days, it is clear that two different policies are in sharp conflict. Should the Korean question be resolved peacefully, or through the expansion of the war? Should the United Nations, as an institution, be strengthened to become a legitimate and effective international organization, or should the United Nations continue to be weakened and its nature altered? Should the United Nations and the Security Council be rescued from the clutches of the American war machine and restored to the lofty powers they should have according to the UN Charter, becoming an authoritative body for maintaining world peace and resolving international disputes? Or should the United Nations and the Security Council continue to be occupied by American imperialism, becoming a branch of the U.S. State Department and an instrument of aggression, helping the American imperialists to systematically advance their war conspiracy to invade the world? The former policy leads to peace, the latter to war.

The people of the world support peace and oppose war, so they choose the former policy. The ruling groups of the American imperialists and their vassal states, on the other hand, fear peace and create war, so they have chosen the latter policy. Now, the two paths of war and peace are both before the United Nations Security Council.

The Soviet representative Malik's proposal in the Security Council for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question is completely reasonable and fully in line with the wishes of the people of the world. This proposal includes two main points: First, to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate and to hear the views of representatives of the Korean people when discussing the Korean question; second, to cease hostilities in Korea and simultaneously withdraw foreign troops from Korean territory. The first part of the proposal aims to strengthen the authority, fairness, and reasonableness of the United Nations Security Council. The second part of the proposal aims to immediately extinguish the flames of war in Korea while eradicating the roots of the Korean civil war.

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly stated that the representatives of the Kuomintang remnants and bandits within the United Nations and its Security Council cannot represent China at all and should be promptly expelled, and the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China should be promptly accepted. This indisputable position of our government has been justly supported by countries such as the Soviet Union and India, but unreasonably rejected by the Anglo-American bloc. The Anglo-American bloc's conspiracy is to use the majority it controls to completely transform the United Nations and its Security Council into tools of imperialist aggression. However, to disregard the actual situation of one of the five permanent members of the Security Council and forcibly recognize the pseudo-representatives of the Kuomintang remnants as representatives of China cannot but place the Security Council in an illegal position. Our Foreign Minister Zhou formally declared in a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on July 6: "The resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council on June 27 under the command and manipulation of the United States government... was passed without the participation of the two permanent members, the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and is obviously illegal." This means that only when the representatives of China's only legitimate government—the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China—and the Soviet Union participate, the organizational composition of the United Nations Security Council is fully legitimate and meets the provisions and requirements of the UN Charter. Only in such a legitimate Security Council, the resolutions unanimously passed by all five permanent members can produce international legal effect and play a practical role in consolidating peace. Otherwise, any resolutions passed by the Security Council under the coercion of the imperialist bloc cannot but be forged resolutions that violate the UN Charter and have no international legal significance or effect whatsoever. Therefore, Soviet Representative Malik's reiteration of the Soviet Union's proposal to invite our representatives to participate in the Security Council is entirely reasonable.

Regarding the Korean question, the aforementioned statement by Foreign Minister Zhou on July 6 stated: "The UN Charter stipulates that the United Nations shall not be authorized to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state, and the Security Council's resolution of June 27 violates this important principle of the UN Charter." On the contrary, under the manipulation of the Anglo-American bloc, in the absence of representatives from China and the Soviet Union, the Security Council has insisted that the Korean civil war is "aggression," insisted that it was not the Syngman Rhee puppet clique that launched the war, but the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and used this as a pretext to support the U.S. government in sending large numbers of naval, land, and air forces to Korea to carry out brutal armed aggression; at the same time, using the Korean question as an excuse to carry out armed intervention in the internal affairs of China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Since the truth of the matter is such, the United Nations Security Council can truly restore its credibility, reduce the impact and scope of the Korean War, and continue to fulfill its responsibility to maintain peace only by accepting the Soviet representative's proposal to unconditionally stop U.S. military intervention and immediately withdraw U.S. naval, land, and air forces from Korea. As for the Security Council's resolution of the Korean question, according to Article 32 of the UN Charter, the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should, of course, be invited to attend as parties concerned to present their views. Otherwise, allowing only the United States to speak, but not allowing the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—the object of American accusations—to speak, would be unfair and a violation of the UN Charter, which should never be tolerated.

Based on the above reasons, the Chinese people wholeheartedly support the Soviet representative's proposal for a "peaceful resolution of the Korean question," believing that only by fully implementing all the recommendations in this proposal can the United Nations and the Security Council's lost credibility be restored and protected from being illegally usurped by the imperialist bloc as a shield for expanding aggressive war; at the same time, only in this way can the raging flames of war in Korea be extinguished in time, and peace in the Far East and the world be consolidated.

Due to the crimes of the United States and its vassal states in stealing the name of the United Nations to undermine peace, the United Nations and the Security Council are now facing an unprecedentedly serious crisis in the history of the United Nations, namely: degenerating from an institution for maintaining world peace into an institution for organizing new wars and implementing new wars by the American imperialists, from a protector of peace into a direct threat and destroyer of peace. Therefore, rescuing the United Nations and the Security Council has become a pressing and major task for all peace-loving, just, and freedom-loving people in the world today. Now is not too late, and the smooth realization of rescue work is not completely without hope. On this point, the Soviet representative's proposal cannot but be said to have made a very significant and powerful contribution. We, the Chinese people, are willing to unite with all honest governments and honest people in the world to jointly support the Soviet proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and to liberate the United Nations and its Security Council from the clutches of the American aggressors, so that it can restore its original glorious status as a peace defender!

### 拥护和平解决朝鲜问题的提议

　　拥护和平解决朝鲜问题的提议
    由于帝国主义集团的千方百计的捣乱和阻挠，本届联合国安全理事会不得不以极缓慢的速度来进行它的议事日程。
    从几天以来安理会的激烈辩论中，人们可以很清楚地看出，有两种不同的政策正在尖锐地斗争着。是和平解决朝鲜问题呢；还是以扩大战争来解决朝鲜问题？是加强联合国这个机构，使它成为合法的有效的国际组织呢；还是继续听任联合国的被削弱、被改变性质？是把联合国及安全理事会从美国的战车上解救下来，恢复其根据联合国宪章所应有的崇高职权，成为维持世界和平、解决国际纠纷的一个权威性机构呢；还是听任联合国及安全理事会继续为美帝国主义所霸占，成为美国国务院的分支机构和侵略工具，来帮助美帝国主义者有计划地推进其侵略世界的战争阴谋？前一个政策导向和平，后一个政策导向战争。
    世界人民拥护和平，反对战争，所以要选择前一个政策；美帝国主义者及其仆从国家的统治集团则畏惧和平，制造战争，所以他们选择了后一个政策。现在战争与和平的两个前途，都摆到了联合国安全理事会的前面了。
    苏联代表马立克在安理会上所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，是完全合理的，完全符合于世界人民的愿望的。这个提案包括两个主要的内容：其一，邀请中华人民共和国代表参加，并在讨论朝鲜问题时听取朝鲜人民的代表陈述意见；其二，停止朝鲜境内的战事，并同时自朝鲜境内撤出外国军队。第一部分建议的作用在于加强联合国安全理事会的权威性和公平合理性；第二部分建议的作用则在于立即扑灭朝鲜境内的战火，同时根绝朝鲜内战的根源。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府周外长曾迭次声明，联合国及其安理会内的国民党残余匪帮的代表是完全不能代表中国的，应当迅速驱逐国民党残余的伪代表，并迅速接受中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表。我国政府的这个无可争论的立场，曾受到苏联、印度等国的公正支持，但是受到美英集团的无理拒绝。美英集团的阴谋就是利用它所操纵的多数，使联合国及其安理会完全变为帝国主义的侵略工具。但是如此不顾五个常任理事国的一国的实际情况而强认国民党残余的伪代表是中国的代表，就不能不使安理会陷于非法地位。我国周外长在七月六日致联合国秘书长赖伊的电文中正式声明：“联合国安全理事会于六月二十七日在美国政府指挥操纵下所通过的……决议，是在没有中华人民共和国和苏联两个常任理事国参加之下通过的，显然是非法的。”这就是说，只有在中国唯一合法的政府——中华人民共和国中央人民政府和苏联的代表都参加的情形之下，联合国安全理事会的组织成份才是充分合法的，才是符合于联合国宪章的规定与要求的；也只有在这样一个合法的安全理事会中，以它五个常任理事国全体参加所一致通过的决议，才有可能产生国际法定的效力并发挥巩固和平的实际作用。否则安全理事会在帝国主义集团挟持下所通过的任何决议，都不能不是违反联合国宪章的伪造的决议，都丝毫没有国际的法定的意义和效力。因此，苏联代表马立克这次重申苏联的邀请我国代表参加安理会的主张，这是完全合理的。
    关于朝鲜问题，前述周外长的七月六日声明中说明：“联合国宪章规定不得授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖的事件，而安全理事会六月二十七日的决议正违反了联合国宪章的这一重要原则。”与此相反，安全理事会在中苏两国理事没有出席的情形下，却在美英集团的操纵之下，硬说朝鲜的内战是“侵略”，硬说发动战争的不是李承晚傀儡集团而是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并借此支持美国政府派遣大批的海陆空军到朝鲜去实行残暴的武装侵略；同时利用朝鲜问题为借口，来实行武装干涉中国、越南和菲律宾的内部事务。事实的真相既是这样，所以联合国安全理事会只有在接受苏联代表的提议，设法无条件停止美国军事干涉与立即由朝鲜撤退美国海陆空军部队的条件下，才能真正恢复自己的信誉，缩小朝鲜战争的影响和范围，并继续履行其维护和平的职责。至于在安全理事会解决朝鲜问题的时候，依照联合国宪章三十二条的规定，当然应该邀请朝鲜人民共和国的代表作为当事国出席陈述意见，否则只许美国发言，而不许美国所诬告的对象——朝鲜人民共和国的代表发言，那就是不公平的和违反联合国宪章的行为，是决不应该被容许的。
    根据以上的理由，中国人民由衷地赞成苏联代表所提的“和平解决朝鲜问题”的议案，认为只有完全实现这个议案中的全部建议，才能恢复联合国及安全理事会已经丧失了的信誉，并保卫它们不致再被帝国主义集团所非法僭窃来作为扩大侵略战争的护身符；同时，也只有这样，才能及时地扑灭朝鲜境内的燎原战火，巩固远东以及世界的和平。
    由于美国及其仆从国家的盗窃联合国名义来破坏和平的罪行，现在联合国及安全理事会正遭遇着联合国有历史以来空前未有的严重危机，即：由维护世界和平的机构堕落为美帝国主义者组织新战争，实行新战争的机构，由和平的保卫者堕落为和平的直接威胁者与破坏者。因此，抢救联合国和安全理事会便成了今天全世界一切爱好和平、正义与自由的人民的当前急迫的重大任务。现在时间还不算太迟，抢救工作的顺利实现还不是完全没有希望的。在这一点上，苏联代表的提案不能不说是有了非常重大而有力的贡献。我们中国人民愿与全世界一切正直的政府和正直的人士联合一致，共同支持苏联关于和平解决朝鲜问题的提议，并且使联合国及其安全理事会从美国侵略者的魔掌下获得自由，使它回复其原来的和平保卫者的光辉地位！
