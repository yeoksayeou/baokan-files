Xinhua News Agency, August 9th:

　　The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a notice on August 8th regarding preparations for league building before the Land Reform Movement. The full text is as follows:

　　After this year's autumn harvest, land reform will be implemented in areas with a population of 100 million. The Youth League should actively participate in this great movement and become a loyal assistant to the People's Government and the Communist Party in the social reform movement in the new rural areas. Therefore, seizing the time to prepare for league building before this year's land reform is the most urgent and important task for the Youth League in the new rural areas. The Central Committee of the League hereby puts forward the following points, which are to be implemented by the Youth League committees in all regions where land reform will be implemented this year.

　　First, the existing full-time cadres of the Youth League must be given universal training. The purpose is to make them understand not only the purpose and policies of land reform, but also the professional knowledge of how to build the league during the land reform movement. This training should be combined with the party consolidation training before land reform, in addition to being conducted through league schools and training courses at all levels. Education on league building should be carried out among all cadres participating in land reform, and attention should be paid to admitting cadres who meet the requirements for league membership.

　　In terms of cadre preparation, it should be carried out with emphasis according to the instructions of the CPC Central Committee's "Several Provisions on Youth League Cadres." First of all, in the more than 300 counties undergoing land reform, county and district-level League Working Committees should be equipped as much as possible. Whether the county and district-level league committees can be properly equipped is the key to whether league building can be carried out smoothly in this year's land reform movement.

　　In order to consolidate and strengthen the Youth League's grassroots organizations in rural areas, the county and district-level league committees should further strengthen the leadership of existing league branches and strengthen branch education in practical work such as production and grain requisition. Necessary organizational rectification can be carried out for some branches that are not functioning. League committees at all levels should conduct inspections and summarize past league building work in conjunction with the rectification movement, draw experience, and educate cadres. They should also send cadres to participate in the work of typical pilot areas and villages before land reform to create experience in league building during land reform and in the role of the Youth League in land reform.

　　Second, whether in land reform areas or rent reduction areas, the policy of developing league members in a guided, step-by-step, and steady manner should be adopted. League building in the new areas is very important, so it must be actively developed, but the established league must be able to play a certain leading role. This requires paying attention to admitting young people who have participated in farmers' associations, who are active in their work, and who have a certain understanding of the league, on the basis of conscious voluntarism. League building is to make the youth movement better and to increase the strength of farmers in the land reform movement. It is not to engage in league building in isolation from the land reform movement, but to build the league while mobilizing all young farmers to participate in the land reform movement. It is necessary to actively and correctly carry out the publicity and organizational work of league building, rather than relying on acute, isolated pursuit of numbers. All regions should formulate league building policies and plans based on subjective and objective conditions, and submit them to the party committee and the higher-level league committee for examination and approval. In the case where the youth masses have a high degree of awareness and there are more and stronger cadres carrying out league building work, the league building work can be carried out faster; if there are not enough cadres, it can be gradually established from point to area; if cadres are very lacking and the masses have a poor understanding of the league, and the objective conditions for league building are not yet in place, then it is possible to postpone league building for the time being. In terms of the use of cadre power, do not use full-time youth cadres evenly. If the actual situation permits, cadres can be appropriately concentrated in areas with better conditions for league building, and the league in these areas can be built well. With a position, experience, and trained cadres, the league building area can then be further expanded. It is incorrect to attempt to achieve "village-by-village league building" and "eliminate white spot villages" in the land reform process of several months. In addition, the saying that "the land reform period is too busy and there is no way to build the league at all" is equally wrong.

　　Third, engaging in league building work during the land reform movement cannot rely solely on a few full-time youth work cadres, but must also, under the leadership and help of the party committee, entrust a number of general cadres (i.e., general party members or league member cadres who do not specialize in youth work) participating in land reform to help carry out league building work. During the land reform process, special attention should be paid to strengthening the system leadership work of the league committee itself. League committees at all levels should have special personnel to grasp the overall situation, strengthen the reporting system by using various means of transportation and methods, conduct inspections in a timely manner, hold meetings regularly, and issue instructions and circulars in a timely manner, so as to effectively mobilize all young farmers to actively participate in the land reform movement; in order to promote the smooth development of the youth movement and league building work.

### 青年团中央委员会发出通知  做好土地改革运动以前建团准备工作

　　青年团中央委员会发出通知
    做好土地改革运动以前建团准备工作
    【新华社九日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会于八日发出关于做好土地改革运动以前的建团准备工作的通知。全文如下：
    今年秋收以后，将在一亿人口的地区实行土地改革，青年团应该积极地参加这一个伟大的运动，成为人民政府和共产党在新区农村社会改革运动中的忠实助手。因此，抓紧时间，在今年土地改革以前作好建团的准备工作，这是当前新区农村青年团的最为迫切重要的工作。团中央特提出下列数点，请今年将要实行土地改革的各地区青年团团委注意执行。
    第一、必须将青年团已有的专职干部加以普遍训练，目的在于使他们既懂得土地改革的目的和政策，又熟悉在土地改革运动中如何建团的业务知识。这种训练除经过各级团校、团训班进行外，并要与土地改革前的整党训练相结合。要在所有参加土地改革的干部中间进行建团工作的教育，并注意将其中具备团员条件的干部吸收入团。
    在干部准备上应根据中共中央“关于青年团干部的几点规定”的指示，有重点地进行配备。首先，要在三百多个进行土地改革的县内，尽可能将县、区级团工委配备起来。县、区两级团委的能否适当地配备起来，这是能否在今年土地改革运动中顺利地开展建团工作的决定关键。
    为了整顿和加强青年团在农村中的基层组织，县、区两级团委应在生产、征粮等实际工作中，进一步加强对已有的团支部的领导，加强支部教育。对某些不起作用的支部可进行必要的组织整理。各级团委应结合整风运动，进行检查、总结过去的建团工作，得出经验，教育干部。并派干部参加土地改革前的典型试验区、乡的工作，创造土地改革中建团和在土地改革中发挥青年团作用的经验。
    第二、无论土地改革地区与减租地区，都应采取有领导地、有步骤地、稳步地发展团员的方针。新区建团很重要，所以要积极发展，但建立起来的团，要能够起一定领导作用，这就要注意把参加了农民协会的、工作积极的、对团有了一定认识的青年，在自觉自愿的基础上去吸收入团。建团是为了使青年运动开展得更好，使农民在土地改革运动增加力量，不是孤立地脱离土地改革运动去搞建团，而是要在动员全体青年农民参加土地改革运动中去建团。要积极地、正确地进行建团的宣传工作与组织工作，而不是靠急性的孤立地追求数字。各地应根据主、客观情况，去规定建团方针与计划，并经同经党委及上级团委审查批准。在青年群众觉悟较高同时进行建团工作的干部也较多较强的情况下，建团的工作可以开展得快一些；如果干部不够，则可有步骤地逐渐由点到面的去建立；如果干部非常缺乏，群众对团的认识还很差，建团的客观条件还很不具备时，就可暂且不忙去进行建团。在使用干部的力量上，不要把专职的青年干部平均使用。如果实际情况许可，可适当地把干部集中在条件较好的地方去进行建团，确实把这些地区的团建好。有了阵地，得到经验，锻炼了干部，然后再进一步扩大建团地区。这样的效果会更好一些。企图在几个月的土地改革过程中达到“村村建团”、“消灭白点村”是不正确的。此外，认为“土地改革时期太忙，根本无法建团”的说法同样是错误的。
    第三、在土地改革运动中从事建团工作，不能只靠少数专职青年工作干部，而是还须在党委的领导和帮助下，委托若干参加土地改革的一般干部（即非专做青年工作的一般党员或团员干部）去帮助进行建团工作。在土地改革过程中应该特别注意加强团委本身的系统领导工作，各级团委要有专人掌握全面情况，利用各种交通工具及办法加强报告制度，及时进行检查，定期召开会议，适时地发布指示和通报，以便有效地动员全体青年农民去积极参加土地改革运动；以便推动青年运动及建团工作的顺利开展。
