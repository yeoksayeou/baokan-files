Editor's Note: The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" was renovated by the workers of the Harbin Locomotive Depot in Northeast China and implemented a contract responsibility system. From 1947 to 1949, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" continuously made contributions and became a model for the implementation of contract responsibility on Northeast railways. In March 1949, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" was ordered to enter Shanhaiguan and took the lead in promoting the contract responsibility system. At the Ministry of Railways' Locomotive Conference, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" was also selected as the banner of the national railways; the driver, Li Yong, was selected as a Special-Class Labor Hero.

The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" gradually grew up under the cultivation of the Party and the active efforts of the crew comrades. In particular, Comrade Li Yong, who was originally ideologically backward, gradually transformed and advanced step by step through the education of the Party and the help of Comrade Guo Shude, and finally joined the Communist Party of China and became a nationally renowned labor hero.

Starting today, this newspaper will serialize this medium-length report on the "Mao Zedong Locomotive."

I. The Origin of the "Mao Zedong Locomotive"

	In the spring of 1946, Harbin was liberated.

	At that time, there was a great shortage of locomotives. Someone said:

	"There is a broken No. 304 locomotive abandoned at Zhaodong Station. Let's pull it back and repair it."

	No sooner said than done, the workers of the locomotive depot pulled it back.

	The workers contributed all the spare parts and tools they had collected in the past.

	The world is ours, let's do it! Let's work hard! Work from dawn to dusk, work overtime.

	Amazingly, it was successfully repaired in just twenty-seven days.

	Painting, engraving, electroplating, casting characters; what else is missing? That's right, we should hang a portrait of Chairman Mao.

	It looks much better now. — The locomotive has been exquisitely decorated.

	Still not satisfied, what else is missing!

	A loyal and clever person said: "Let's name it after the leader!"

	He guessed what people were thinking. People were happy and smiling. We respect the people's leader, we love the people's leader, there is nothing better than this, so we named the locomotive "Mao Zedong Locomotive."

II. Old Hero Li Yong

	Who should be chosen as the driver of this "Mao Zedong Locomotive"? The leadership gave it a lot of consideration.

	As a result, the old hero Li Yong was selected.

	Speaking of Li Yong, it's a long story.

	He is from Yongji County, Jilin Province, Northeast China. He studied in a private school for three years, farmed leased land for three years, and worked long hours for landlords.

	Unable to support his family, he went to work as a coolie on the Harbin Railway at the age of seventeen.

	He was always a coolie, and only became an apprentice stoker at the age of twenty-seven.

	It was really difficult to learn a craft at that time. He couldn't afford to bribe people, and only became a driver at the age of thirty-seven.

	During the puppet Manchukuo period, he drove trains. The heads of the locomotive depot were all Japanese. If he said something wrong, he would be slapped in the face. If something was not to their liking, he would be slapped.

	Did you want to reason with them? Big leather boots, gun butts, and bayonets were the reason!

	Swallow the tears in your stomach, keep the words in your heart - work, drive.

	He worked for thirty years, and those thirty years were really not easy!

	Like a thunderclap: "The saviors are here! Liberation!"

	The People's Liberation Army (Note 1) wore tattered clothes, and Li Yong began to look down on them a little.

	He thought: They are greasy and dirty (Note 2), how can they look like an army?

	Strangely enough, these soldiers were really kind: they didn't seize vehicles, they didn't beat people, they bought and sold fairly, and they were friendly.

	Li Yong gradually understood: "In the past, I was a slave to the locomotive; only when the Communist Party came did I drive the train for myself."

	Once at night, there was no moon and no lights, and people were extremely tired. He sent the passenger train to Sankeshu and entered the depot, and returned to Harbin on a single engine, passing through Binjiang Station. "Hey, what's that?" In front of him was a large dark area, pressing on the turnout. "Not good!" he thought, and immediately applied the brakes. When he got out of the car, he saw that a locomotive had passed the parking block (Note 3), only two meters away from crashing into it.

	Let me tell you another story: From Wangzhaotun to Harbin, there is a curve, a downhill slope, and a cross-over. The embankment on the side of the road is very high, so you can't see the corner ahead. When the train reached the vicinity of the cross-over, he listened carefully, listening intently. He heard a "rumbling" sound. He determined that a locomotive was coming from the opposite direction, immediately sounded the danger whistle, and at the same time let the train proceed slowly. Sure enough, the locomotive on the opposite side also sounded the danger whistle, and both sides stopped. Otherwise, there would have been a terrible head-on collision!

	At the Heroes' Conference at the end of 1946, people were accurate in their judgment, and Li Yong was elected a Labor Hero.

	Note 1: At that time in Northeast China, it was called the Democratic Allied Army.

	Note 2: Meaning dirty.

	Note 3: That is, "guard mark". The train must not pass this mark when stopping, otherwise it is easy to collide with other trains. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作  庄言插图
    编者按：“毛泽东号”，是东北哈尔滨机务段的工友们装修起来的，实行了包乘负责制。自一九四七年至一九四九年，“毛泽东号”不断立功，成了东北铁路实行包乘的模范。一九四九年三月，“毛泽东号”奉命入关，带头推行包乘制。在铁道部机务会议上，“毛泽东号”又被选为全国铁路的旗帜；司机长李永被选为特等劳动英雄。
    “毛泽东号”是在党的培养下，在乘务员同志们积极努力中，逐渐成长起来的。特别是李永同志，原先思想落后，经过党的教育，经过党员郭树德同志的帮助，一步步转变、前进，而终于参加了中国共产党，并成为全国闻名的劳动英雄。
    今日起本报连载这一篇“毛泽东号”的中篇报告。
    一、“毛泽东号”的来历
    一九四六年春天，哈尔滨解放了。
    当时火车头非常缺。有人说：
    “肇东车站抛弃着一台三○四破烂机车，把它拉回来修理吧。”
    说干就干，机务段工人把它拉回来了。
    工人们把过去收藏的零件和工具都献出来了。
    天下是咱们的了，干吧！加油吧！起早摸黑，加班加点。
    了不起，仅仅二十七天，就抢修成功了。
    喷漆、刮花、电镀、铸字；还缺少一些什么吧？对了，该挂上毛主席的像。
    这一来好看多啦。——机车精致地装饰起来了。
    还不满足，还缺少一些什么呢！
    忠诚又聪明的人说了：“叫上领袖的名子吧！”
    他算猜透人们的心了，人们都高兴啦，笑啦。我们尊敬人民领袖，我们爱戴人民领袖，没有比这再好的了，就把机车起名“毛泽东号”。
    二、老英雄李永
    找谁来当这“毛泽东号”的司机长呢？领导上很费考虑。
    结果，选中了老英雄李永。
    提起李永，可就话长啦。
    他是东北吉林省永吉县人，念过三年私塾，种过三年租子地，给地主扛过长活。
    养不活家，十七岁上到哈尔滨铁路上当小工。
    一直是小工，二十七岁上才当学习司炉。
    那时候学手艺可真难，又花不起运动费，三十七岁才熬成了司机。
    伪满时期他跑车，机务段的头子都是日本人，一句话不对就挨嘴巴，一件事不顺眼就吃耳光子。
    你想讲理吗？大皮靴、枪托、刺刀就是理！
    把眼泪咽到肚里去，把话蹩在心里——干活，开车。
    他整整干了三十年，三十年的日子真不容易过呀！
    霹雳一声：“救命人来啦！解放啦！”
    解放军（注一）服装破旧，李永开始有点瞧不起。
    他想：油脂麻花（注二）的，那像个队伍？
    说也奇怪，这些兵倒真是仁义：不抓车，不打人，公买公卖，和和气气。
    李永渐渐明白了：“过去那些年我是机车的奴隶；只有共产党来了，我才替自己开车。”
    有一次夜里，没有月亮也没有灯光，人也极疲乏。他送客车到三棵树入了库，单机回哈尔滨，经过滨江车站。“嘿，那是什么？”前面黑虎虎一大片，压着道岔子。“不好！”他捉摸，立刻撂了闸。下车一看，原来一台机车过了停车挡（注三），只差两米没撞上去。
    再说一次吧：王兆屯到哈尔滨，是弯道，下坡，又有十字岔。道边土崖很高，看不见前面的拐角。车到十字岔附近了，他留神听着，倾听着。他听见一种“轰轰”的声音。他断定对面有机车过来了，立刻拉响危险笛，同时让车徐行。果然对面那台机车也拉响危险笛，双方都停下了。要不，就是一场可怕的正面冲突！
    一九四六年年底的群英大会上，人们看的准，李永当选了劳动英雄。
    注一：当时在东北叫民主联军
    注二：不干净的意思。
    注三：就是“警卫标”停车不能过这个标，否则就容易和别的车发生冲撞。（附图片）
