　　Adjusting Cadres and Strengthening Inspection Work
    Shanxi Province's Tax Revenue Work Improves
    Second Quarter Tax Revenue Target Completed
    [Our Taiyuan Dispatch] Shanxi Province's tax revenue work has gradually improved through vigorous adjustment of cadres, strengthened leadership, and continuous overcoming of confused thinking. The second quarter tax revenue has been completed to 108.2% of the planned target.
    In accordance with the spirit of the Central Government's decision on unified financial and economic work, the province conducted adjustments of tax cadres throughout the province in March and April. However, because the party committees and governments at the special district and county levels initially failed to attach sufficient importance to this, the first quarter's task was not completed, and tax evasion was extremely serious in various places. For this reason, the Provincial Government Committee officially issued a decision on strengthening tax revenue work on May 2nd. Each special district then followed the Provincial Government's instructions to adjust cadres; some bureau chiefs were concurrently held by special commissioners. Only in Xingxian Special District, due to a lack of cadres, has the cadre problem not yet been resolved. The Provincial Government is currently studying the matter.
    After the new bureau chiefs took office, leadership of tax revenue work has been strengthened compared to before. In the adjustment process, the ideological mood of general tax cadres was also normal. However, some new confused thoughts arose among a minority of cadres. After some of the older, less capable former bureau chiefs were reassigned to deputy positions, ideas about reputation and status caused instability in their mood. Some bureau chiefs newly transferred from party committees or governments did not adequately recognize the importance of tax revenue work, feeling that their positions had been lowered and still harboring unwillingness to do tax work. A small number of worker-peasant cadres with low levels of education believed that after the victory of the revolution and the regularization of work, they were of insufficient ability and pessimistic about their future, and had "stepping down" thoughts. The above-mentioned confused thoughts and emotions have, to varying degrees, affected the further improvement of work.
    In addition, in order to eliminate tax evasion, the Provincial Taxation Bureau, at the same time as the Provincial Government issued a decision to strengthen tax revenue work, issued "Instructions on Strengthening Inspection Work and Launching an Anti-Tax Evasion Movement," and organized tax revenue and liquor inspection teams to go to Linfen and Yuncheng Special Districts in succession to supervise and inspect and provide specific assistance to various places. As a result, the erroneous thinking among cadres that undervalued tax revenue work was gradually reversed, and work began to change. For example, after Changzhi and Yuci Special Districts implemented the Provincial Bureau's instructions, convened county bureau chief meetings, and launched inspection work, work gradually got on the right track. In particular, Changzhi Special District only completed 92% of its task in the first quarter, but completed 139% in the second quarter. Among them, the county heads of Licheng, Yangcheng, Lingchuan and other counties often participated in leading tax work. Other special districts also continuously issued circulars to criticize, commend, and exchange experiences.
    In terms of anti-tax evasion: Taiyuan City uncovered 188 tax evasion cases in May alone. After inspection, in the department store industry alone, 197 households automatically paid more than 33 million yuan in stamp duty. When the Changzhi industrial and mining area was evaluating industrial and commercial taxes, combined with checking for tax evasion, eight companies, including the Fuxingyuan waterspipe shop, paid back more than 10,000 catties of millet. Pianguan County inspected seven villages, including Baoziwan, and collected over 18,000 catties of millet in livestock transaction taxes, equivalent to 77.6% of the county's first quarter industrial and commercial tax revenue.
    In the inspection work in various places, policies were generally widely publicized, and the principle of strict investigation and lenient treatment was grasped, which enabled many merchants to automatically pay taxes. For example, among the 188 tax-evading merchants uncovered in Taiyuan City, only 46 were punished, and the rest paid taxes according to regulations after education.
  The Phenomenon of Random Binding and Fines Should Be Corrected
    However, in the work, some areas have indeed had many shortcomings and errors in bureaucracy, commandism, and random punishments that are not in accordance with regulations. For example, in the investigation of privately brewed liquor in Shouyang and other counties, incidents of tying people up occurred. Some places turned boxes and baskets during inspections for tax evasion, and the masses reacted very badly. There are also phenomena of random fines. For example, four supervisory merchants in Yuncheng owed industrial and commercial tax arrears, and their attitude was cunning and blunt. The director of the town's tax bureau failed to persuade and educate them well, and impulsively imposed a fine of fourteen times the amount of the arrears. These phenomena must be continuously overcome and corrected in future work, so that tax revenue work can be further improved.

### 调整干部加强稽查工作  山西省税收工作有改进  第二季税收任务已经完成

　　调整干部加强稽查工作
    山西省税收工作有改进
    第二季税收任务已经完成
    【本报太原讯】山西省税收工作在大力调整干部，加强领导与不断克服混乱思想当中，逐步得到改进，第二季税收，已完成预计任务的百分之一百零八点二。
    根据中央统一财经工作决定的精神、该省在三、四月份即在全省进行了税收干部的调整，但初时因未能引起各专、县党政的十分重视，致第一季度任务并未完成，且各地漏税现象异常严重。为此，省府委员会遂于五月二日正式发布加强税收工作的决定。各专区即先后依照省府指示进行调整干部，有的局长系由专员兼任。仅兴县专区因干部缺乏，干部问题至今仍未获解决，省府正研究中。
    新局长到任后，税收工作的领导已较前加强。在调整中，一般税收干部思想情绪亦正常。但在少数干部中产生了一些新的混乱思想。个别能力较差资格较老的旧局长改任副职后，名誉地位思想作怪，情绪不稳。一部分由党委或政府新调任的局长，对税收工作认识不够，认为是自己地位降低了，仍有不愿做税收工作的情绪。少数文化低的工农干部认为革命胜利，工作正规，自认能力薄弱，前途悲观，有“退坡”思想。以上这些混乱的思想情绪，曾或多或少影响了工作的进一步提高。
    另外，省税务局为了杜绝漏税，在省府发布加强税收工作的同时，发出《关于加强稽查工作展开反偷漏运动的指示》，并组织税收、酒业检查团，先后分赴临汾、运城两专区进行督促检查并给各地以具体帮助。因而逐渐扭转了干部中轻视税收工作的错误思想，使工作开始有了转变。如长治、榆次两专区，在贯彻省局的指示，召开县局长会议，展开稽查工作后，工作即渐上正轨。特别是长治专区第一季任务仅完成百分之九十二，第二季即完成百分之一百三十九。其中黎城、阳城、陵川等县县长经常参加领导税务工作。其他专区亦不断发出通报进行批评、表扬、交流经验。
    在反偷漏税方面：太原市仅五月份即查获漏税案件一百八十八起。经过检查后，仅百货一个行业即有一百九十七户自动补印花税三千三百余万元。长治工矿区在评议工商业税时，结合检查漏税工作，仅水烟行复生源等八家即补税小米一万多斤。偏关县检查了该县堡子湾等七个村，即补缴牲畜交易税小米一万八千多斤，相当该县第一季工商业税的百分之七十七点六。
    在各地稽查工作中，一般均能广泛宣传政策，掌握严缉宽处的方针，使得不少商户纷纷自动补税。即如在太原市查获的一百八十八家漏税商户中，受罚者仅四十六家，余均经教育后照章补税。
  乱捆乱罚现象尚应注意纠正
    但在工作中，有些地区也确实发生了不少官僚主义、命令主义及不按条例随便处罚的缺点和错误。如在寿阳等县查私酒中，即发生捆人事件。有些地方检查漏税时翻箱倒笼，群众反映很坏。还有随便罚款的现象，如运城镇有四户监商拖欠工商业税尾欠，态度刁滑生硬，该镇税局局长即未能很好说服教育，竟感情用事处以尾欠十四倍的罚金。这些现象均须在今后工作中，不断加以克服和纠正，使税收工作能有进一步的改进。
