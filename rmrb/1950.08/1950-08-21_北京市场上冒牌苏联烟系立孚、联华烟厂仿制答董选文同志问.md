　　Counterfeit Soviet Cigarettes on the Beijing Market
    are Imitated by Lifu and Lianhua Tobacco Factories
    Answering Comrade Dong Xuanwen's Question

Editor Comrade:
    Chinese cigarette production already exceeds demand. Why are Soviet cigarettes appearing on the market? Please answer.
                                                 Dong Xuanwen

Comrade Dong Xuanwen:
    The Soviet cigarettes you discovered on the Beijing market are counterfeits produced by two private tobacco factories in this city, Lifu and Lianhua. They use the Russian trademarks "Moscow," "Red Light," and "Iron Horse" respectively. Among them, the "Iron Horse" brand even uses Russian to label "Made by the Ministry of Food Industry of the Soviet Union," openly impersonating Soviet products. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry has already discovered the above situation and is dealing with it.

　　北京市场上冒牌苏联烟
    系立孚、联华烟厂仿制
    答董选文同志问编者同志：
    中国纸烟生产已供过于求，为何在市场上出现苏联纸烟？请解答。
                                                 董选文董选文同志：
    你在北京市场上发现的苏联纸烟，是本市立孚、联华两家私营烟厂仿制的。他们分别采用“莫斯科”、“红光”、“铁马”三种俄文商标。其中“铁马”牌竟用俄文标着“苏联食品工业部制”字样，公然冒充苏联产品。上述情况，北京市工业局业已发现，并正予处理中。
