Taking the Lead in Repairing the Lake Embankment
    ——A Record of the Heroic Actions of Two Hui Women

The Hui women of Majiadian Village, Shuanghe Township, Shankou District, Huaining County, Northern Anhui Administrative Region, demonstrated a heroic spirit of overcoming all difficulties and working hard in the intense flood control work, working side by side with the men and achieving remarkable results. The following is an introduction to the heroic deeds of two model Hui women.

Ma Xiaoyin Takes the Lead in Repairing and Reinforcing
    The lake embankment in Majiadian Village is very low, seven Chinese inches lower than last year's flood water level. Therefore, repair is an important task in flood control. Ma Xiaoyin is the women's association group leader of Majiadian Village. After signing up for flood control work at the women cadres' meeting, she stayed up all night thinking of ways to mobilize the women to go to the embankment. The next day, after hearing the news that Si Huazhen from the village had already mobilized and organized women to participate in flood control work, she became even more anxious and immediately convened a women's meeting in her group. When discussing flood control work at the group meeting, the women were not enthusiastic. Everyone said, "Flood control is a man's business." "It's so hot, people can't stand it!" "What about the children at home if we go to the embankment?" According to everyone's thoughts, she raised the question at the meeting: "Who is flood control for? Was it good when the embankment broke last year?" and asked everyone to discuss it. League member Ding Dongsheng said, "Last year, when the embankment broke, many houses were washed away. We can't let the embankment break again this year. Protecting the embankment is our own business, and everyone has a responsibility." Ding Zhongxian said, "Flood control is for ourselves, and the children can be left to the elderly to take care of. If we don't carry out flood control, even if the seedlings grow well, we won't be able to eat them if the embankment breaks." After such a discussion, everyone realized that flood control was for themselves, and twenty-two women signed up to participate in flood control. Everyone unanimously elected Ma Xiaoyin as the squad leader.
    During the repair work, other squad leaders were responsible for the work of digging and leveling the soil, while Ma Xiaoyin personally took the lead in carrying soil on the embankment. She accurately grasped the time, leading everyone to work more in the morning and evening, and allowing everyone to rest more when it was hot at noon, taking care of everyone's health. When everyone was resting, she went to dig soil, level the soil, shovel sod, and fill in depressions by herself, conscientiously checking and repairing the project. She also often led everyone to sing songs (Hui songs) to boost everyone's morale. When people had no vegetables to eat or firewood to burn, she took out her own vegetables and firewood for everyone to use. Under her leadership, the women's morale was very high, and their work efficiency gradually improved. At the beginning, each person could only carry one and a half cubic meters of soil per day, but later gradually increased to two or three cubic meters of soil. On July 22nd, each person carried three and a half cubic meters of soil. This was the highest record in the entire embankment repair, greatly promoting the progress of the repair project.
    On July 20th, the lake water rose, and a strong wind blew in the afternoon, but the lake embankment had just begun to be repaired, and the embankment body was very dangerous. Ma Xiaoyin led her team of women to participate in the repair work first. The women were afraid to go into the water to drive piles, so she jumped into the water first. Under her influence, the women all participated in this emergency rescue work. After an afternoon of hard work, all the laborers drove wooden piles along six *li* of the embankment, blocking the impact of the flood. The embankment then turned from danger to safety.

Si Huazhen Leads the Ramming of Stone Embankments
    Ramming is the main task in the repair project. However, because this work is relatively strenuous, many people are unwilling to participate when organizing the ramming team. At the women's labor mobilization meeting for ramming, Si Huazhen stood up and said, "Ramming is a major event. The embankment is only safe if the ramming is done well. No matter how much soil we carry, it won't be able to stop the flood if the ramming is not done well. If the embankment breaks, we will not only waste our efforts, but also suffer great losses. Young and strong people should participate in the ramming work. I will be one of them." Under her influence, twenty young and strong women signed up to participate in the ramming team. Everyone elected Si Huazhen as the ramming team leader.
    When the women started ramming, everyone's hands were blistered, and they all said, "We can't do this kind of work!" Si Huazhen also had many blisters on her hands, but she gritted her teeth and continued to work, and explained to everyone, "What do blisters on your hands matter! It's glorious to look at the blisters on your hands after protecting the embankment! If there are no blisters on your hands, can the ramming be done well?" Under her encouragement, the women's morale gradually increased. She paid great attention to the solidity of the project and often said to everyone, "One inch not strong, ten thousand *zhang* are useless; one person is negligent, ten thousand people suffer." She not only rammed with everyone, but also went to carry the ramming ropes during rest, or went to the ridge to check the ramming project; after returning in the evening, she also boiled water for the women to bathe, and helped the women cook in the morning. Therefore, she received the enthusiastic support of the women.
    The ramming team led by male youth league member Ding Xianlu issued a challenge to them. The women all said, "We are not as strong as men, we will definitely not be able to beat them in the competition." Si Huazhen and the young female league members in the ramming team held a group meeting in the evening. Si Huazhen said, "Don't be afraid, everyone. It's useless to be strong if you don't work hard. We have practiced almost enough, and we will definitely be able to beat them." Everyone's enthusiasm increased, and they were determined to compete with the male comrades. As a result of the three-day competition, Si Huazhen's ramming team had more advantages and won the title of model ramming team.

　　带头抢修湖堤
    ——记两个回族妇女的英勇行为
    皖北行政区怀宁县山口区双河乡马家店村的回族妇女们，在紧张的防汛工作中，发挥了排除万难、艰苦奋斗的英勇精神，和男人们并肩工作，获得了显著成绩。下面是两个回族模范妇女英雄事迹的介绍。
    马小印带头抢修抢险
    马家店村的湖堤很低，比去年洪水水位要低七公寸。因此抢修是防汛中一个重要工作任务。马小印是马家店村的妇女会小组长。她在妇女干部会上报名参加防汛工作后，回家一夜没睡觉，想办法动员妇女们上堤。第二天，她听到本村斯华珍已经动员组织了妇女参加防汛工作的消息后，更加焦急，就立刻召开了本组妇女会。在小组会上讨论防汛工作时，妇女们都不起劲，大家说：“防汛是男人的事。”“天这样热，人受不了！”“上堤后，家里小孩子没人看管怎么办？”。她根据大家的思想，就在会上提出：“防汛为谁？去年破圩好不好？”叫大家讨论。团员丁东生说：“去年破圩，许多房屋被水冲跑了。今年可不能再让破圩。保圩是自己的事，大家都有责任。”丁忠宪说：“防汛是为自己，小孩子可以留给老人们照顾。要是不进行防汛，苗长的好，破了圩也吃不到嘴。”经过这样一讨论，大家认识到防汛是为了自己，就有二十二个妇女报名参加防汛。大家一致推选马小印当小队长。
    在抢修中，别的小队长担任打土平地工作，马小印在堤上亲自带头挑土。她准确地掌握着时间，她领导大家早晚多干些活，中午天热时让大家多休息一下，照顾了大家的身体。大家休息时，她一个人又去打土、平土、铲草皮、填凹地，认真负责地检查与修理工程。她又经常领导大家唱歌（回族歌），鼓起大家的情绪。大伙没菜吃没柴烧时，她把自己的菜与柴拿来供大家用。妇女们在她的领导下，情绪非常高，工作效率也逐步提高。开始时每人每天只能挑一方半土，后来逐步增加到二方三方土。在七月二十二日那天，每人挑了三方半土。这是全堤抢修中的最高纪录，大大推动了抢修工程的进展。
    七月二十日湖水上涨，下午又刮起大风来，而湖堤才开始抢修，堤身非常危险。马小印领导着本队的妇女首先参加了抢修工作。妇女们不敢下水打桩，她就先跳到水里。在她的影响下，妇女们都参加了这一抢险工作。经过一下午的努力，全体民工打了六里路长的木桩，阻挡了洪水的冲击。堤便由险转安。
    斯华珍领导打石峨
    打硪是抢修工程中的主要工作。但是因为这个工作比较费劲，所以在组织硪工队时，有许多人不愿意参加。在妇女民工动员打硪会上，斯华珍站起来说：“打硪是件大事，硪打的好堤才保险。挑土再多，硪打不好也挡不住洪水。破了圩，我们不但白费力气，还要遭受大损失。年青力壮的人应该参加打硪工作，打硪我算一个。”在她的影响下就有二十个年青力壮的妇女报名参加了硪工队。大家选举斯华珍当硪工队长。
    妇女们开始打硪时，大家的手上都起了泡，都说：“这种工作咱可干不了！”斯华珍的手上也起了不少泡，但她却咬着牙继续工作，并且向大家解释说：“手上起泡算什么！保住了圩再看看手上的泡才光荣呢？要是手上不起泡，硪能打好吗？”妇女们在她的鼓励下，情绪就渐渐高了。她非常注意工程的坚固，常对大家讲：“一寸不牢，万丈无用；一人疏忽，万人遭殃。”她不但和大家一起打硪，休息时还去背硪绳，或去垅上检查打硪工程；晚上回来后又给妇女们烧水洗澡，早上帮助妇女们作饭。因此，得到妇女们的热烈拥护。
    男青年团员丁宪录领导的硪工队，给她们来了个挑战书。妇女们都说：“咱们力气小，男人们力气大，咱们一定比赛不过他们。”斯华珍和打硪队里的女青年团员们在晚上召开了小组会。斯华珍说：“大家不要害怕，力气大不努力干也没用。我们练的差不多了，一定能赛过他们。”大家劲头大了，都决心和男同志比赛。三天比赛的结果，斯华珍硪工队优点多，荣获模范硪工队的称号。
