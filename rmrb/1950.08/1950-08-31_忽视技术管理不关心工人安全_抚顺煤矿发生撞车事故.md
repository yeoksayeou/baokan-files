Ignoring Technical Management and Disregarding Worker Safety
Fushun Coal Mine Experiences Collision

[Report from this newspaper] A collision occurred near the Xintun station of the Fushun Coal Mine, resulting in 31 deaths, 38 serious injuries, and 19 minor injuries. One locomotive, two carriages, and 40 meters of track were damaged. Including funeral and compensation expenses, the total loss amounted to 6,973.3 million Northeast currency.

On August 7th, at 11:00 PM, electric locomotive No. 1142, under the jurisdiction of the Fushun Mining Bureau's Transportation Office, departed from the coal washing plant of the Laohutai Coal Mine. As it approached the Dongwandawu station, the driver intended to brake and slow down in order to hand the order slip to the stationmaster. Upon braking, he felt little deceleration. He braked a second time, but still to no effect. The driver then threw the order slip on the ground and the locomotive continued to move forward. Approaching the Wanxin Bridge, the driver, Li Hongchen, saw that the entry signal for the Xinwu station was a slow signal (yellow) and the exit signal was a stop signal (red). At the same time, he noticed the headlight of a locomotive in the distance (passenger train No. 9). Wanting to slow down the train, he braked the train twice in succession, but to no avail. He then applied emergency brakes, but still nothing happened. He became quite panicked and called flagman Fu Chengkui to help stop the train. Fu Chengkui, based on his past experience, went to the front of the locomotive and unplugged the train's brake pipe, discovering very little residual air. The train still did not slow down. At this point, the locomotive had reached the front of the Xintun station building, only 295 meters from the stop signal. Driver Li Hongchen became even more alarmed and repeatedly braked several times, but still to no effect. Locomotive No. 1142 then ran past the departure signal of Xintun Station by 85 meters. At 11:47 PM, it collided head-on with passenger train No. 9 (carrying mostly second-shift workers from the Longfeng Mine) which was about to enter Xintun Station, pushing passenger train No. 9 back 35 meters from the collision site, causing a major transportation incident.

One hour after the accident, Liu Fang, the First Deputy Director of Fushun, and others arrived at the scene to direct the handling of the aftermath. The injured have been sent to the hospital and given consolation money. The deceased employees have been properly buried, and funeral, relief, and compensation fees have been paid. After cleaning and restoration, the line was reopened to traffic at 11:00 PM the next day.

The direct cause of the accident was that driver Li Hongchen had too little experience, did not thoroughly inspect the locomotive before departure, operated improperly after departure, and panicked, lacking sufficient knowledge of single-engine braking versus full-train braking, causing the brakes to fail and leading to the runaway train. However, from a leadership perspective, the main problem was the neglect of technical management and the improper use of personnel. Driver Li Hongchen was originally a passenger train ticket collector. He only underwent three months of training at the Transportation Office, and was promoted to a formal electric train driver, replacing older workers, because of his "pure political stance." The office, due to neglecting technical management, still does not have a new and complete set of transportation regulations, and research and improvement on traffic safety equipment and implementation methods are also extremely inadequate.

In order to more thoroughly investigate the Xintun collision accident, the mine has now organized a Xintun collision accident investigation committee to examine the problems existing in the Transportation Office's overall work in engineering, transportation, locomotive operations, and business, in order to improve work and avoid liability accidents.

### 忽视技术管理不关心工人安全  抚顺煤矿发生撞车事故

　　忽视技术管理不关心工人安全
    抚顺煤矿发生撞车事故
    【本报讯】抚顺煤矿新屯车站附近发生撞车事故，死三十一人，重伤三十八人，轻伤十九人；损毁机车一辆，随车二辆，路轨四○公尺；加上丧葬抚恤费等开支，共损失六十九亿七千三百余万元（东北币）。
    八月七日下午十一时，抚顺矿务局运输事务所所辖之一一四二号电气机车由老虎台煤矿选煤厂驶出，行至东万达屋车站，司机意图掣动缓驶，以便向站长递交命令圈时，一经掣动已感减速不大，继续又作第二次掣动，仍不见效，司机遂将命令圈掷在地上，机车继续前进。接近万新桥时，司机李鸿臣看见新屋车站的入站信号为缓行信号（黄色），出站信号为停车信号（红色），同时也发现对面远方有机车的前照灯（即九号旅客列车），欲使列车减速，遂连续作列车掣动两次，仍未得结果，接着又作非常掣动，还是无效，因之颇为慌张，遂招呼司旗富成魁协助停车。富成魁依其过去经验，走到机车最前端，拔开列车掣动管，发现余气很少，列车仍未减速，这时机车已到达新屯车站站房前，距离停车信号仅二九五公尺。司机李鸿臣更感惊慌，又反复掣动数次，仍未发生任何效果，一一四二号机车遂闯出新屯站出发信号八五公尺，于十一时四十七分与对方将驶进新屯车站之九号旅客列车（乘客大部分是龙凤矿第二班下班工人）正面冲突，立由肇事地点将九号旅客列车推回三五公尺，造成运输上的重大事件。
    事故发生后一小时，抚顺第一副局长刘放等赶到现场指挥善后工作。负伤人员已送往医院，发给慰问金；对于死亡员工均已妥予安葬，并发给丧葬、救济及抚恤费；线路经过清理与修复工作，于次日二十三时恢复通车。
    发生事故的直接原因，虽然是由于司机李鸿臣经验太少，出发时对机车检查不彻底，出发后操作不当，慌张失措，对单机掣动与全机掣动认识不够，致使车闸失灵，引起跑车事故。但从领导上检讨，主要是因为忽视技术管理，用人不当所致。司机李鸿臣原系客车检票员，只经过运输事务所三个月的训练，反因其“政治立场纯洁”代替了老工友任正式电车司机；该所由于忽视技术管理，至今尚没有一套新的完整的运输规程，对于行车安全设备及执行方法的研究改进亦极不够。
    为了更详尽的检查新屯撞车事故，该矿现已组织新屯撞车事故调查委员会，检查运输事务所有关工务、运输、机务、业务等全盘工作中存在的问题，以求改进工作，避免责任事故的发生。
