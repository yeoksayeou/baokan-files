　　Romania's Countryside Today and Yesterday
　　Soviet Union  Luo Kai Te Zi
　　We arrived at the village of Vancalasti in the Dâmbovița region of Romania on a festival day. Farmers gathered in a magnificent mansion surrounded by trees (formerly the property of Prince Bibescu), in a conference hall with mirrored walls. Today's meeting is to implement the decision to organize a collective farm in the village. Outside the gate, many vehicles were parked, carrying guests from nearby villages. The farmers were dressed in beautiful national costumes, accompanied by bands, countless national flags, banners, and giant portraits of Stalin and the leaders of the Romanian Workers' Party. The magnificent decoration inside the mansion—all of this testified to the solemnity of the occasion.
　　The band was playing; young people gathered by the windows, singing to their hearts' content, waiting for the meeting to begin. A farmer named Marin told us about the miserable days when the whole village was under the control of the lady of the manor.
　　"At that time, we were forced to work day and night. We were barefoot, ragged, and constantly threatened by hunger. One day, I picked some nettles in the landlord's field to cook some soup for my thirsty family, but I was caught, interrogated like a thief, and sent to the gendarmes, suffering a brutal beating."
　　Other farmers also couldn't forget the terrible past. Stănescu, a sixty-year-old farmer, had cultivated the land for a landlord who owned 4,500 hectares all his life. There was also Ludovic Popa, who had worked as a farmhand for the landlord Golin. He still remembered that every day, as soon as it got dark, he would drag himself home, collapsing on a pile of straw, and had to start working again at dawn. Day after day was like this.
　　Not to mention the poor peasants, even the middle peasants were not much better off.
　　When Ilie Menciu, a farmer in the Roman region, was unable to pay off a debt of 1,000 lei (Romanian currency unit, one leu is equal to one-one hundred and sixtieth of a U.S. dollar - translator's note), the landlord confiscated his house, three plots of land (about 1,500 square meters), and all his property. Because if the farmers could not pay off the extremely small debts, those landlords would take away horses, carts, grain, and fodder worth ten times the amount of the debt.
　　Romanian farmers struggled hard for survival in the past. Not only did the lords of the manor plunder the poor peasants, but the tax system was also a heavy burden on them. Taking the Ialomița region as an example, in 1931, the 62,383 hectares of land owned by the landlords in the region were levied a total of only 5,870,000 lei. But the poor farmers who owned the same amount of land had to pay 15,057,000 lei, which was twice the burden of the landlords. Excessive taxes relentlessly deprived the farmers of their last possessions.
　　In practice, farmers did not have modern agricultural tools when cultivating. The land was still cultivated in the most primitive way. Even middle-peasant families could not afford to buy modern agricultural tools such as seeders, cultivators, mowers, and reapers. As for tractors and combine harvesters, they had never appeared in the fields.
　　But that was only the recent past, and now we are sitting with the former poor peasants in the house of the old landlord. Today, they have become the masters of the country.
　　The liberation of Romania, like a glorious sun, broke through the heavy haze and oppression that had suffocated the Romanian peasants for centuries, enabling the working class and the laboring peasants to establish a democratic regime under the leadership of the Communist Party. As a result, 1.1 million hectares of land were distributed to the poor peasants. Tractors have also appeared on the farms. State-owned machine tractor stations cultivated 65,000 hectares of land in 1948, and in the spring of 1949, this number increased to 210,000 hectares. During the harvest season, eighty of these tractor stations served 1,639 farms.
　　But this is only the beginning. According to the plan, by 1955, machine and tractor stations will provide plowing services for a total of more than 19 million hectares of farms. There is no doubt that these will be successful.
　　Romania's young tractor industry is increasing its production volume day by day. On December 16, 1949, the tractor factory in Brasov produced 3,000 tractors, and in the next five years, Romania will have 25,000 tractors.
　　Six hundred and eighty-eight state-owned farms have been established on the land of former landlords. They are equipped with machines and cultivated with the latest achievements in agricultural management science. The role of their widespread use of modern farming methods cannot be underestimated. For example, the harvest of wheat, oats, and barley on these farms has exceeded the usual by two to three times, corn by five times, and potatoes by more than six times.
　　The bumper harvest of state farms fully demonstrated to the peasants the benefits of large-scale machine cultivation. Last year, the average grain harvest of land cultivated by old methods was 600 pounds per hectare, while the harvest of land cultivated by tractors was 1,200 pounds and 1,500 pounds per hectare.
　　Seed stations supply farmers with selected seeds for sowing. Agricultural cooperatives rent out plows and harrows. The days when farmers had to pay exorbitant prices to landlords to rent these farm tools are over.
　　Agricultural cooperatives have become a huge force in the Romanian countryside. They have millions of peasant members. In the past, there were only ninety-one agricultural cooperatives in old Romania, with no more than 4,000 members.
　　In mid-1948, agricultural cooperatives sold clothing, shoes, building materials, and agricultural tools worth 15 billion lei to farmers. In the first half of 1949, they sold 9.6 billion lei worth of goods.
　　The new decree on agricultural tax, which came into effect on July 1, 1949, granted important privileges to laboring peasants.
　　This decree stipulates that farms with an annual income of no more than 12,000 lei are exempt from all taxes. The tax amount increases in proportion to income (6.8 percent tax for those with an income of 15,000 lei, 8.32 percent tax for those with 30,000 lei, and so on). Farms with an annual income of more than 400,000 lei have to pay 37.4 percent tax. In addition, a special decree was announced to exempt laboring peasants from the 7 billion lei in taxes owed under the old tax system.
　　Culture has developed in backward and ignorant Romania. The work of eliminating illiteracy has also begun. In the past few years, tens of thousands of peasants have learned to write and read. Eight thousand six hundred village libraries, equipped with political, literary, agricultural technology books, novels, magazines, and newspapers, have been opened in the countryside. Movies have also appeared in remote villages. Forty-six film projection teams have been touring the countryside. The number of projection teams is increasing. In ten months, the total number of viewers reached 2.7 million.
　　Romanian peasants are becoming increasingly active in political life. Tens of thousands of peasants preside over local organs of power—the local committees of the People's Assembly—which are responsible for improving rural living conditions, establishing schools, hospitals, and libraries, and building and repairing roads. Most of the peasants work very actively in these committees and therefore gain practical work experience in the government.
　　The government's decrees aimed at improving and developing agriculture have gained the support of the vast majority of peasants. For example, when the Ministry of Agriculture decided to implement the plan to reclaim 11,000 hectares of land early in order to prepare for cultivation, thousands of peasants voluntarily participated in the reclamation and other work. As a result, the state saved 145 million lei in expenses.
　　Romanian peasants are facing new problems and new prospects. They are increasingly inclined to collective labor organizations. In 1949, 55,000 poor and middle peasant households had joined farm joint land cultivation. Farms with a high degree of collective labor organization are working. In the village of Vancalasti, we personally witnessed the birth of such a farm. There are already fifty-six such collective farms in Romania, combining nearly 4,000 peasant households. (According to a Xinhua News Agency report: At the request of many poor and middle peasants, the Romanian government has recently established forty-seven more collective farms - translator's note)
　　What are these farms like? According to the decree, after joining, farmers have to use their land, livestock, farm tools, feed, seeds, and main farmhouses as public property. On the one hand, the state allocates a fund from the state land fund to the collective farm and allows it to be exempt from taxes for the first two years. Each farmer can still leave half a hectare of land for his own residence and to place farm tools around. In addition, each farmer can also keep a cow, a pig and some piglets, up to ten goats and sheep, fifteen beehives, and unlimited poultry and rabbits.
　　In addition to all necessary expenses, the collective farm distributes its harvest equally (except for seed funds and things that are not suitable for distribution). The distribution principle is based on the daily work performance of the villagers. If some farmers overfulfill their work, they will receive a bonus equal to 10 to 20 percent of their daily work quota.
　　These are the main points of the collective farm decree.
　　Farmers participating in collective farms have found a shortcut to improving their living standards. Last autumn, Romanian farmers visited various departments of the Soviet Union. After they returned to their country, they told their compatriots about their experiences. Tens of thousands of farmers have seen the concrete image of the affluent, fulfilling, and happy collective farm life they longed for.
　　The Romanian countryside, along with the entire Romania, is advancing and developing along the road to socialist development.
　　Of course, it goes without saying that the transformation of the Romanian countryside is a complex and difficult step. It takes place on the basis of fierce class struggle. The former landlords and rich peasants are stubbornly resisting the laboring peasants who are wholeheartedly building a new life. They are trying to undermine the government's decrees. They want to deceive backward and ignorant peasants with lies, slanders, and spreading vicious rumors. The more their—the people's enemies—land is liquidated, the more brutal they become. There has already been such a situation: landlords and rich peasants, with the help of the former Nazi Iron Guard, directly implemented terrorist means in the countryside.
　　But all lies, slanders, and threats cannot achieve their purpose. In the village of Vlasca, the rich peasants were particularly active in trying to prevent the organization of collective farms, but the peasants did not fall into their trap.
　　In fact, the movement of joint cultivation there is developing more strongly. In Moho village, Nasa area, the rich peasants carried out a cruel struggle against the agricultural consumer cooperatives, but they failed again. Their efforts have encountered the same miserable failure elsewhere.
　　The Romanian countryside is steadily developing towards a new road to a happy life, with a reliable leadership force—the working class and its party.

### 罗马尼亚农村的今日和昨日

　　罗马尼亚农村的今日和昨日
    苏联  罗开特兹
    在一个节日，我们到达了罗马尼亚丹波维塔区的凡卡兰斯蒂乡村。一所树林围绕着的华丽的大厦（从前本是王子贝比斯卡的地产），中间有装设壁镜的一个会议厅，农民就集合在那里。今天开会是为了要实行本村组织一个集体农场的决定。大门外，停着许多从附近村庄接载宾客来的车辆。农民们穿着漂亮的民族服装，随带乐队、无数的国旗、旗帜、斯大林与罗马尼亚工人党领袖们的巨像，大厦内部盛大的装饰——所有这一切，都说明了场面的庄严隆重。
    乐队演奏着；青年们聚集在窗边尽情歌唱，等待着会议的开始。一个农民马林告诉我们过去这全村在庄园的贵妇控制下的悲惨的日子。
    “那时候，我们被迫一天到晚工作着。我们赤着两脚，衣衫褴褛，并且常受饥饿的威胁。有一天，我在地主的田里采了一些荨菜，想煮点汤给饥渴的家里人喝，结果我被抓住了，像小偷一样，受了审问，并被押送给宪兵，捱受一顿横暴的拷打。”
    其他的农民也忘不了可怕的过去，六十岁老农斯坦奈斯古，曾给拥有四千五百公顷的地主耕种了一辈子。还有鲁德维克·鲍波，曾给地主哥林做过长工。他还记得，以前每天一到天晚，他就拖步回家，累倒在稻草堆里，天一亮就得再开始工作。一天天都是这么过的。
    且不说贫农，就是中农也好不了几多。
    当罗马区一个农民衣里爱·孟召许，无力偿付一千列伊（罗币单位，每列伊等于一美元的一百六十分之一——译者注）的债务时，地主就把他的房子、三块地（约有一千五百平方公尺）与他所有的财产没收了。因为如果农民不能偿付为数极微的债务，那些地主就会将价值十倍于债款的马匹、货车、谷物与饲料拿走。
    罗马尼亚农民过去为生存而挣扎是够艰苦的。不但庄园的领主掠夺着贫农，税收制度也同样是贫农的沉重负担。以亚罗米塔区作例来说，一九三一年该区地主们所有的六万二千三百八十三公顷土地，总共只征收了五百八十七万列伊。而对于拥有同样数量土地的贫苦的农民们，则要征收一千五百另五万七千列伊，也就是说要两倍于地主的负担。苛捐杂税就把农民们最后的所有物也无情地剥夺去了。
    农民们在耕种时候实际上是没有现代化的农具的。土地还是以最原始的方式在耕种着，播种机、耕耘机、刈草机与收刈机等现代化农具，即使中农人家也无力购置。至于拖拉机与联合收割机则从来没有在农田里出现过。
    但这只是最近的过去，而现在我们已与以前的贫农们一起坐在旧时地主的屋里了。今天他们已成为国家的主人了。
    罗马尼亚的解放，正如光辉的太阳，冲破了几世纪来窒息着罗马尼亚农民的沉重的阴霾与压迫，使得工人阶级与劳动农民在共产党领导之下，建立起民主政权来。于是，一百十万公顷的土地分给贫农了。拖拉机也在农场上出现了。国营的机器拖拉机站在一九四八年耕种了六万五千公顷土地，而在一九四九年的春天，这个数字就增加到二十一万公顷。在收获的季节里，八十个这种拖拉机站为一千六百三十九个农场服务着。
    但这只不过是开始。根据计划，到一九五五年时，机器与拖拉机站将为总数达一千九百万公顷以上的农场耕犁服务。这些无疑是一定会成功的。
    罗马尼亚共和国年青的拖拉机工业正日积月累地增加着它的生产量。一九四九年十二月十六日，勃拉索夫的拖拉机工厂，生产了三千架拖拉机，而在今后五年中，罗马尼亚将要有二万五千架拖拉机。
    六百八十八个国营农场已在从前地主的土地上建立起来。它们有机器的装备，并以最新的农业管理科学的成就来耕耘。它们普遍使用现代农作法的作用是不能低估的。举例来说，这些农场的小麦、燕麦与大麦的收获，已较平常超过了二三倍，玉蜀黍多五倍，而马铃薯则多六倍以上。
    国家农场的丰收向农民充分地证明了大规模机器耕种的利益。去年以旧式方法耕种的土地，谷物的平均收获是每公顷六百磅，而以拖拉机耕种的土地，其收获则为每公顷一千二百磅与一千五百磅。
    种籽站以选种供给农民播种。农业合作社出租着犁耙。农民要付出苛刻的代价向地主恳赁这些农具的日子是过去了。
    农业合作社已成了罗马尼亚农村中的一股巨大的力量。它们拥有数百万的农民社员。而在以前，旧罗马尼亚只有九十一个农业合作社，社员还不超过四千以上呢。
    一九四八年中，农业合作社售给了农民价值达一百五十亿列伊的衣着，鞋靴、建筑材料与农具。一九四九年上半年则售出了九十六亿列伊的货物。
    从一九四九年七月一日开始施行的关于农业税的新法令，给予劳动农民以重要的特权。
    这个法令规定：岁收不超过一万二千列伊的农场得以免除一切赋税。而税额的征收则按收入的比例而增加（收入达一万五千列伊者征税百分之六点八，三万列伊者收税百分之八点三二，余以此类推）。每年收入在四十万列伊以上的农场就得付税百分之三十七点四。此外又公布了一项特别的法令，将劳动农民在旧税制之下所欠缴的七十亿列伊的税款免除。
    文化已在落后的愚昧的罗马尼亚发展起来。扫除文盲的工作也已开始。过去几年来，成千成万的农民学会了书写与阅读。八千六百个备有政治、文学、农业技术书籍、小说、杂志与报纸的乡村图书馆，已在农村中开设了。边远的乡村中也出现了电影。四十六个电影放映队已在乡村中巡回放映。放映队的数目正在增加中。在十个月内，观众总数就达二百七十万人。
    罗马尼亚农民在政治生活中日益活跃起来，成万的农民主持着地方政权机构——人民议会的地方委员会——它负有改善农村生活条件，兴办学校、医院、图书馆，建筑与修理道路的责任。大部分的农民在这些委员会中工作得非常积极，并因此而在政府中获得了实际的工作经验。
    政府旨在改进与发展农业的法令，获得了广大农民的支持。例如当农业部决定提早实行开垦一万一千公顷土地的计划以便预备耕种时，成千的农民就自动地参加了开垦与其他工作。因而使国家节省了一亿四千五百万列伊的支出。
    罗马尼亚的农民面临着新的问题与新的展望。他们日渐倾向于集体的劳动组织了。在一九四九年，五万五千户贫农与中农已参加了农场联合耕种土地。具有高度集体劳动组织形式的农场，正在进行工作。在凡卡兰斯蒂村，我们就亲眼看见了这样一个农场的诞生。罗马尼亚已有五十六个这种集体农场，结合着近四千户的农民。（据新华社报道：罗马尼亚政府应很多贫农中农之请，最近又建立了四十七个集体农场——译者注）
    这些农场是什么样的呢？按照法令，农民在参加以后，就得把他的土地、牲畜、农具、饲料、种子与主要的农舍作为公用。国家一方面就从国家土地基金中分配一份资金给集体农场。并在最初二年准其免缴捐税。每个农民尚能留下半公顷作为自己安居与在四周安置农具的土地。此外，每个农民还可以保留一头牛、一只猪与一些小猪、最多十只山羊与绵羊、十五个蜂房与没有限额的家禽与兔子。
    除了一切必需的开支外，集体农场就把它的收获作平均的分配（种子基金与个别不适于分配的东西除外）。分配原则是按照庄员每日的工作成绩，如果某些农民超额完成了他们的工作，就会得到等于他每日工作定额百分之十至二十的红利。
    这些就是集体农场法令的几个要点。
    参加集体农场的农民们，已找到了提高他们生活水准的捷径了。去秋罗马尼亚农民访问了苏联各部。在他们回国以后，就把他们的见闻告诉同胞，成万的农民已看见了在他们想望中的富足的、美满的幸福的集体农庄生活的具体形象了。
    罗马尼亚的农村，连同整个罗马尼亚，沿着向社会主义发展的道路，在前进在发展。
    当然，不用说，罗马尼亚农村的转变是一个复杂的艰难的步骤。它发生在剧烈的阶级斗争的基础上。从前的地主与富农，正对竭诚建设新生活的劳动农民作顽强的抵抗。他们企图破坏政府的法令。他们想以谎言、诽谤与散布恶毒的谣言来欺骗落后与愚昧的农民。他们——人民的公敌——的土地愈被清算得多，他们也愈残酷成性。现在就已经有过这么一种情况：地主富农靠着前纳粹铁卫队的帮助，在乡村中直接施行了恐怖手段。
    但是，一切谎言、诽谤与威胁都不能达成他们的目的。在夫拉司卡村，富农们特别积极地想阻止集体农场的组织，但是农民们没有上了他们的圈套。
    事实上，联合耕种的运动在那里却更坚强地发展着。在纳莎区摩霍村，富农们进行了反对农业消费合作社的残酷斗争，但是他们再一次地失败了。他们的努力在别处也遭遇到同样的惨败。
    罗马尼亚农村正稳固地向新的幸福生活的道路发展着，它有着可靠的领导力量——工人阶级与它的政党。
