　　The Movement to Defend Peace in Pakistan
　　By A. Vasilyev, Soviet Union
　　Since the British Labour Government implemented the partition of India and Pakistan became an "independent" country, no changes have occurred in the lives of the eighty million people of Pakistan. The people continue to suffer from extreme hunger, poverty, and political disenfranchisement as they did before. Under the oppression of British imperialism, the people continue to waste away as they did before. The "new things" are only that: the pressure of American monopoly forces on their British partners, as in other parts of the British Empire, is becoming increasingly strong in Pakistan, and American influence is penetrating Pakistan's political and economic life with the warm sympathy of Pakistan's rulers.

　　American and British imperialists not only regard Pakistan as their own disenfranchised colony for Wall Street entrepreneurs to reap huge profits but also as their Eastern military strategic base. The recognition of the devastating nature of this path to Pakistan's national interests is increasingly widespread among all strata of the Pakistani people. The broad masses of the people are involved in the struggle to support peace and oppose the instigators of a new war. The first All-Pakistan Peace Congress was held this spring, initiated by the Pakistan Progressive Writers Association, the Democratic Students Federation, and the Democratic Women's Federation. This congress laid the organizational foundation for the national peace movement, calling on the people to "resolutely struggle to prevent Pakistan from becoming the 'cannon fodder' of imperialist aggressors." The congress unanimously supported the Stockholm Declaration banning atomic weapons.

　　After the congress, Pakistan rapidly launched a wide-ranging movement to solicit signatures for the Stockholm Declaration, and this movement is now at its peak.

　　Workers, farmers, students, teachers, newspaper editors, doctors, lawyers, writers, and journalists are all signing the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. The Pakistan Times wrote: Even some police officers and soldiers of the Pakistani army support the peace movement and signed their names on the declaration of the Standing Committee.

　　Progressive Pakistani writers, many trade unions, student unions, and women's associations actively participated in the signature campaign. Representatives of these groups, numbering in the thousands, went to shops and markets to explain the purpose of the movement to the people. They attended various gatherings and mass meetings in the workers' districts. They also directly solicited signatures on the streets. The Lahore Democratic Women's Federation mobilized all its members to collect signatures. Women went to every household and courtyard in Lahore to explain to the people the danger of war and the urgent need to fight for peace and shatter the military preparations of the instigators of a new war.

　　When people asked an old woman from the Democratic Women's Federation why she was so enthusiastically participating in the peace movement, she replied: "I have three sons. My eldest son has three children. They want to go to school. I don't want them to be cannon fodder for greedy imperialists. I want them to start living a happy life."

　　Newspaper workers in Lahore widely responded to the call to sign the Stockholm Declaration. For example, Ali Khan, editor of the *Chamindar* newspaper, Nizam, editor of the *Nawai Waqt* newspaper, Faiz, editor of the *Pakistan Times* newspaper, Haji Lat, editor of the *Imroze* newspaper, and Maikate, editor of the *Maghribi Pakistan* newspaper, all signed the declaration. All the staff of the editorial department also signed along with the editors.

　　Railway employees living in the squalid workers' housing area called "Basti" warmly welcomed the "peace volunteers" (as signature collectors are called in Pakistan). In their view, the struggle for peace is the struggle for bread, housing, and life. One railway worker dedicated all his free time to help accomplish this sacred task—collecting signatures on the declaration banning atomic weapons.

　　He said: "I myself have served in the military, and I fought in Burma. During the Great War, we were promised real happiness, but now look at me, look at my ragged appearance. Go and see my home; my family lives in a dark, gloomy, and smoky hut. My wife is suffering from tuberculosis, but I cannot afford a doctor. I only earn fifty rupees a month, but I have to support six people. How can I not hate war! I will never fight for the American and British lords."

　　Student union members talked about such things: "One day we went to a barbershop in Lahore, and many customers and barbers signed the declaration, but one barber refused to sign. Our classmates began to tell him about Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But this barber had never heard of these cities. Then it was explained to him that these cities in Japan were just like Lahore, but the Americans wanted to destroy them with atomic bombs. The barber shouted: "I love my Lahore. I have lived here for thirty years, and I don't want it to be destroyed." So he also signed his name. Hundreds of shop owners in Lahore voluntarily signed the declaration. They said loudly: "We don't want war; we don't want our businesses to suffer. Only greedy tycoons will make a fortune in the Great War, and we, the small businessmen, will be completely bankrupt."

　　The *Pakistan Times* also quoted such a passage: "The 'peace volunteers' said: One day we went to the train to collect signatures for the declaration of the Standing Committee. The crowd surrounded us. We noticed a Pakistani officer looking at us; we didn't go to him. At that time, he came to us and said very painfully: I know you don't trust me because I am an officer. You think all soldiers like war. You are wrong. I am a lieutenant colonel, but I want to sign this declaration because I want to ban atomic bombs, and I don't want another great war to happen."

　　When the "peace volunteers" were working among the police, a police officer paid so much attention to the explanation of the declaration that he not only signed it himself but also took several blank papers for his colleagues and later obtained their signatures as well. This policeman pointed to his address on the signature book—Lahore Prison. This is the oldest prison in Lahore.

　　In Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, those who signed the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress included Syed, a former member of the Sindh Provincial Cabinet, Ali Khan, the Prime Minister's brother, Haq, a famous Pakistani linguist, Nurani, the owner of a bookstore, the editors of Karachi's important newspapers *Imroze* and *Andherem*, progressive writers in Karachi, trade union and peasant workers, students, professors, and teachers.

　　The mother of former Pakistani Prime Minister Ali Khan signed in Lahore. Members of the Pakistan Legislative Assembly Shah Nawaz, Iftekharuddin, and Hayat Khan also signed. Mirji, Chairman of the Labor Union, Suhrawardy, former Prime Minister of Bengal, Chima, Secretary-General of the Muslim League in West Punjab, Kasmi, Secretary-General of the Pakistan Progressive Writers Association, Mansur, a famous peasant activist in Punjab, Avchari, Secretary-General of the Pakistan Trade Union Federation, and thousands of other conscientious people all signed.

　　This is just the beginning. News from all corners of Pakistan says that batches of peace supporters are participating in the movement to solicit signatures for the Stockholm Declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. The movement for peace in Pakistan is growing and strengthening. The broad masses of the Pakistani people, like all civilians in the world, do not want war.

　　保卫和平运动在巴基斯坦
    苏联Ａ·瓦西列夫
    自从英国工党政府实行印度分治，巴基斯坦成为“独立”国的时候起，在八千万巴基斯坦人民的生活上，并没有发生什么变化。人民依然和从前一样受着饥饿、贫穷和政治上毫无权利的极端痛苦。人民在英帝国主义的压迫下，依然和从前一样地消瘦。“新的事物”只在于：美国垄断势力对其英国小伙伴的压迫，正如在大英帝国其他部分一样，在巴基斯坦也表现得日益加强，而美国势力在巴基斯坦统治者亲切的同情下，渗入巴基斯坦政治和经济生活也日益加深了。
    美英帝国主义者不仅把巴基斯坦看成自己给华尔街事业家牟取厚利的毫无权利的殖民地，而且也看成是自己的一个东方军事上的战略基地。认识这种道路加于巴基斯坦民族利益的毁灭性，日益强烈地普及于巴基斯坦全国人民的各阶层。广大的民众卷入拥护和平、反对新战争挑拨者的斗争。本年春季举行了第一次全巴基斯坦拥护和平大会，召集大会的发起人是巴基斯坦进步作家协会，民主学生联合会和民主妇女联合会。这次大会奠定了全国拥护和平运动的组织基础，号召人民“坚决斗争，不使巴基斯坦成为帝国主义侵略者的‘炮灰’”，大会一致拥护斯德哥尔摩禁用原子武器的宣言。
    在大会闭幕后，巴基斯坦迅速地展开了对斯德哥尔摩宣言征求签名的广泛运动，这个运动现在正处于极高峰的状态。
    工人、农民、学生、教师、报纸编辑、医生、律师、作家、新闻记者都在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的宣言上签名。“巴基斯坦时报”写道：甚至有些警察和巴基斯坦军队的士兵也支持拥护和平运动，在常设委员会的宣言上签了自己的名。
    巴基斯坦进步作家、许多工会、学生会和妇女会积极参加征集签名。这些团体数以千百计的代表们，走到商店、市场，向人民解释运动的目的。他们出席工人区的种种集会和群众大会。他们也在街头直接征集签名。拉合尔民主妇联动员其全体会员进行征集签名。妇女们到拉合尔的每家、每个院落，向人民解释战争的危险和为和平而斗争，粉碎新战争挑拨者军事准备的迫切必要性。
    当人们问一个民主妇联的老妇人为什么她要这样热情地参加拥护和平运动时，她答道：“我有三个儿子。我的大儿子有三个孩子。他们愿意上学。我不愿意他们替贪心的帝国主义者当炮灰。我愿意他们开始过幸福的生活。”
    拉合尔的报业工作者广泛地响应对斯德哥尔摩宣言签名的号召。例如，《查明达尔》报编辑阿里汉，《纳瓦伊·瓦克特》报编辑尼查米，《巴基斯坦时报》编辑法伊支，《伊姆罗支》报编辑哈支拉特，《马盖里比·巴基斯坦》报编辑马伊卡特都在宣言上签了自己的名。编辑部全体工作人员也和编辑们一道签了名。
    住居在所谓“巴斯契”的污浊工人住宅区的铁路员工们满怀热情地欢迎“和平义勇军”（在巴基斯坦，人们这样地称呼签名的征集者）。在他们看来，拥护和平的斗争就是争取面包、住宅和生活的斗争。一个铁路工作者供献了他的全部休息时间来帮助完成这一神圣任务——征集在禁用原子武器宣言上签名。
    他说：“我自己过去服过军役，我在缅甸打过仗。在大战期间曾经应允过给我们现实的幸福，但是现在看看我，看看我褴褛的样子。你到我的住处看一看吧，我的家属住在黑暗、阴沉、烟雾迷漫的茅屋里。我的妻患着结核病，但我不能请医生。我一个月只赚五十个卢比，可是我必须养活六口人。我怎能不憎恨战争！我永远不会为了美英老爷们打仗”。
    学生会会员谈到这样的事：“我们有一天进了拉合尔的一家理发馆，许多客人和理发师在宣言上签了名，但是有一个理发师拒绝签名。我们的同学开始对他叙述广岛和长崎的事。但是这个理发师从来也没有听说这些城。然后对他解释说，日本的这些城就好像拉合尔一样，但是美国人要用原子弹来毁灭它们。这个理发师喊叫道：“我爱自己的拉合尔。我在这里住了三十年，我不愿意它被毁灭了。”因而他也同样地签了自己的名。拉合尔数以百计的商店老板自愿地在宣言上签名。他们大声说：“我们不要战争，我们不愿意使我们的生意吃苦头。只有贪心不足的大亨们会在大战中发财，而我们，小商人，要完全破产的。”
    《巴基斯坦时报》还引证了这样一段情节：“‘和平义勇军’说：有一天我们到列车上征集对常设委员会宣言的签名。人群把我们包围起来。我们注意到一个正在看着我们的巴基斯坦军官，我们不去找他。当时他来找我们并且很痛苦地说：我晓得，你们不信任我，因为我是个军官的缘故。你们以为全体军人都喜欢战争。你们错误了。我是个陆军中校，但是我要在这个宣言上签名，因为我愿意禁用原子弹，我愿意不再发生大战。”
    当“和平义勇军”在警察中工作的时候，一个警察竟如此聚精会神地注意必须签名于宣言上的说明，他不仅自己签了名，而且替自己的同事们带了几张空白纸，后来也获得了他们的签名。这个警察指着签名书上自己的地址——拉合尔监狱。这是拉合尔最古老的监狱。
    在巴基斯坦的首都——喀喇蚩，在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会宣言上签名的，有信德省前阁员萨耶德、首相的兄弟阿里汉、著名巴基斯坦语言学者哈克、书店主人努拉尼，喀喇蚩重要报纸《伊姆罗支》报和《安德热姆》报的编辑们，喀喇蚩市进步作家们，工会和农民工作者、学生、教授、教师们。
    巴基斯坦前首相阿里汉的母亲在拉合尔签了名。巴基斯坦立法会议会员们沙赫纳瓦支、伊夫契哈鲁德金和贺亚特·汉都签了名。米尔支工联会主席伊卜拉吉姆，孟加拉前首相苏赫拉瓦尔德，西旁遮普省回教联盟秘书长奇马，巴基斯坦进步作家协会秘书长卡斯米，旁遮普著名的农民运动者曼苏尔，巴基斯坦工联会秘书长阿夫查理，和其他成千的有良心的人士都签了名。
    这只是开始。从巴基斯坦各角落里传来消息说，一批接连一批的和平拥护者参加了对世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩全会宣言征集签名的运动。巴基斯坦拥护和平的运动正在成长和加强。巴基斯坦的人民大众，正如世界上的全体平民一样，是不要战争的。（郭从周译自一九五○年七月二十六日“消息报”）
