Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 10th, TASS: The Red Star newspaper commented on the restoration of the Japanese army by the American imperialists in its international commentary. The newspaper stated: American colonialists are giving Japan a more important position in their aggressive plans to suppress national liberation movements in Asian countries. For them, Japan is not only a convenient military springboard but also a supplier of cannon fodder. The American occupation authorities have not only failed to demilitarize Japan but are also restoring Japan's armed forces. Under the guise of the police, they are actually establishing the Japanese army and navy.

According to official figures, the total strength of the Japanese police will soon reach 200,000. In addition, the maritime police will have 18,000 personnel. Japan is accelerating the establishment of a police reserve force. The organization of recruitment agencies and the weapons of this reserve force can explain its own nature. Judging from Japanese press reports, it can be seen that this reserve force will become a real army, with a unified central command and weapons equivalent to the army. Japan is establishing four military districts, and the public security agencies being organized are, in fact, only a disguised Ministry of the Army.

The weapons that the police reserve force is about to receive can also completely expose those who advocate the restoration of the Japanese army. Kyodo News Agency recently stated: The police reserve force "will have heavy weapons." The Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun even stated that it would have armored vehicles. Obviously, ordinary police forces do not need such armaments.

Therefore, the facts show that, under the cover of the police force, the American imperialists and their Japanese puppets are restoring the Japanese armed forces. This is a gross violation of the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's resolution on the demilitarization of Japan.

　　红星报评论美国重建日本陆军
    美国恢复日本武装部队  粗暴地违反波茨坦宣言
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：红星报在国际评论中评论了美国帝国主义者恢复日本陆军一事。该报称：美国殖民分子在其镇压亚洲各国民族解放运动的侵略计划中，给日本一个比较重要的地位。对他们说来，日本不仅是一个方便的军事跳板，更是一个炮灰供应者。美国占领当局不仅未使日本非军事化，而且正在恢复日本的武装部队。他们在警察的掩护下，实际上建立起了日本的陆军和海军。
    据官方数字，日本警察的总实力即将达到二十万人。此外，海上警察将有一万八千人。日本正在加速成立警察后备队。征募机构的组织以及这个后备队的武器，就可以说明它自己的性质。根据日本报界消息来判断，可以看出这支后备队将成为真正的陆军，有单一的中央统帅机构及与陆军相等的武器。日本正在成立起四个军区，正在组织中的治安机关，事实上只是陆军省的变相而已。
    警察后备队即将领获的武器，也同样可以完全揭露那些倡议恢复日本陆军的人。共同通讯社最近称：警察后备队“将有重武器”。东京每日新闻甚至还说它将有装甲汽车。很明显的，寻常的警察部队，是不需要这样的军备的。
    因此，事实说明，用警察部队作掩护，美国帝国主义者及其日本奴仆们正在恢复日本的武装部队。这就粗暴地违反了波茨坦宣言以及远东委员会关于日本非军事化的决议。
