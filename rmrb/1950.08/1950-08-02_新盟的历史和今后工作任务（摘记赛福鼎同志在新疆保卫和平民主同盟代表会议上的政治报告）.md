The History and Future Tasks of the New Alliance
(Excerpts from Comrade Saifuddin's Political Report at the Representative Meeting of the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy Protection Alliance)

　　The "Xinjiang Peace and Democracy Protection Alliance" held a representative meeting in Dihua in early June this year, summarizing the work of the alliance since its establishment, and discussing the reorganization of the alliance and its future work guidelines based on the current situation in Xinjiang. The meeting resolved to rename the alliance the "Xinjiang People's Democratic Alliance" to make it a mass organization of advanced elements of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The meeting determined that the alliance's future task is to unite and lead the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, assist the government, and strive for the construction and reform of Xinjiang. The meeting elected 51 people as members of the General Committee of the alliance, with Saifuddin (Uyghur) as chairman, and He Rui (Han), Abudoukrimhan (Uyghur), and Alwar Ghakulin (Kazak) as vice-chairmen. Comrade Saifuddin made a political report at the meeting. The report gave detailed explanations of the history of the New Alliance, the ethnic situation in Xinjiang, and the future work guidelines of the New Alliance. The main contents of the report are introduced as follows.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor
　　Comrade Saifuddin's report at the "Xinjiang Peace and Democracy Protection Alliance" representative meeting was divided into five parts: the current international and domestic situation, the development history and work of the New Alliance, the national liberation movement in Xinjiang, ethnic relations, and the current tasks of the New Alliance.

The Development History and Work of the New Alliance

　　Regarding the development history and work of the New Alliance, Comrade Saifuddin introduced that the New Alliance was a national united front organization including the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which arose from the needs of the Xinjiang People's Revolution. It was established on August 1, 1948, in the revolutionary base areas of the Xinjiang People – the three districts of Yili, Ashan, and Tacheng. At that time, there were many secret and public revolutionary organizations in Xinjiang, such as the Liberation Society, the Democratic Revolutionary Party, the Revolutionary Youth League, and the Xinjiang Democratic United Association. The New Alliance was initially formed on the basis of these organizations. Its leaders were originally Comrade Ahmatjan and other comrades, leaders of the Xinjiang national liberation movement (Comrade Ahmatjan died in a plane crash on the way to Beijing in September last year). After more than two years of development, the New Alliance now has 77,394 members in the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan, and has become a mass political organization. The basic task of the New Alliance in the past was to unite all ethnic groups, democratic classes, and progressive people in the province in a united front, to oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries who ruled the province, as well as the internal scum of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang who served the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to liberate the people from suffering and establish a democratic government.
　　Comrade Saifuddin said that the main work carried out by the New Alliance in the past was: first, leading the people of the three districts of Yili, etc., to combat the military and economic offensives launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries against the people of the three districts, ensuring the peaceful life of the people of the three districts. Second, the New Alliance also played an important leading role in restoring the people's economy in the three districts that was destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and in improving the people's economic life and cultural and educational levels. The New Alliance assisted the government of the three districts in adopting policies to support farmers and reduce the exploitation of farmers by usury. Third, the New Alliance adopted correct ethnic policies in the three districts, fought for the unity of equality and friendship between ethnic groups, and eliminated the ethnic divisions and hatred caused during the Kuomintang rule. The New Alliance has consistently struggled against the reactionary ideas of pan-Islamism, pan-Turkism, great-Han chauvinism, and narrow nationalism spread among the masses by the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialist spies. Fourth, the New Alliance widely publicized to its members and the general public the inseparable unity of the Xinjiang revolutionary movement and the national revolutionary movement, strengthening the Xinjiang people's love and sympathy for the Chinese people's revolutionary movement and the Chinese Communist Party, thus creating favorable conditions for the convergence of the Xinjiang revolutionary movement and the national revolutionary movement, and for the entry of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army into Xinjiang. Comrade Saifuddin said that although these tasks in Xinjiang were mainly done in the three districts, they were all in line with the interests of the people of the entire province and had an impact on the people of the entire province.
　　Comrade Saifuddin said that the New Alliance has done a lot of work for the people, and there is still a need for the New Alliance to continue to exist and develop in the future. The New Alliance now has a real leader, and that leader is the Chinese Communist Party, which is armed with correct revolutionary theory and has historical experience. The task of the New Alliance in the future is to continue to fight for the real liberation of the people of Xinjiang under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and to turn the backward Xinjiang into an advanced province of the People's Republic of China. In order to adapt to this new need, it is necessary to appropriately reorganize the New Alliance to make it a mass organization of advanced elements of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Only in this way can it truly shoulder the glorious task of leading the people of Xinjiang to further complete the cause of liberation of the people of Xinjiang.

The National Liberation Movement in Xinjiang

　　Regarding the past national liberation movement in Xinjiang, Comrade Saifuddin said that the Xinjiang national liberation movement has a history of nearly a hundred years. The purpose of this movement is to oppose the dark autocratic rule and enslavement policies of the Manchu Qing government and the Kuomintang reactionaries in Xinjiang, and to strive for the freedom and liberation of the people of all ethnic groups. The Xinjiang national liberation movement, which began with the Yili Uprising in the autumn of 1944 and targeted the Kuomintang reactionary rulers and the reactionary elements among the ethnic groups in Xinjiang, was a new development.
　　Comrade Saifuddin said that the reason why the uprising launched in Yili in the autumn of 1944 was able to develop victoriously was because it was in line with the wishes of the people of Xinjiang and was warmly supported by the people. At the time of the Yili Uprising, the revolutionary armed forces had less than one hundred people, and most of them were armed with knives and wooden sticks. However, this armed force finally defeated the attack of thousands of Kuomintang troops, armed itself with weapons seized from the enemy, strengthened its own strength, and finally completely liberated the three districts of Yili, Ashan, and Tacheng.
　　Comrade Saifuddin said that the surging liberation struggle of the people of Xinjiang forced the Kuomintang reactionaries to sign articles on the surface giving freedom to the people. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries finally violated the articles, reorganized the Xinjiang Provincial Government formed according to the articles, and appointed their loyal lackey Mesut as the chairman of the provincial government, handing over the fate of the people of Xinjiang to some national scum and traitors to manipulate again. The Kuomintang reactionaries implemented military dictatorship in most areas of Xinjiang, and arrested, massacred, and exiled people everywhere under the names of "Yili faction," "East Turkistan," "Communists," and "Red Hooves." The Kuomintang reactionaries' suppression of the people of Xinjiang was launched at the same time as their attack on the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries' frantic actions failed to suppress and stop the people's revolutionary movement. On the contrary, the revolutionary movement throughout China and the revolutionary movement in Xinjiang developed and grew rapidly. And due to the victory of the national people's revolution, the Xinjiang national liberation movement also achieved victory.
　　Comrade Saifuddin said that the Xinjiang revolutionary movement is a part of the great Chinese New Democratic Revolution. Most of the people who led the Xinjiang revolutionary movement were revolutionary elements with communist ideas. They adhered to the correct revolutionary line and eventually converged this revolution with the revolution in inland China. At that time, we could not refuse the religious slogans put forward by religious figures in the revolution, and we were unable to carry out social reforms in the areas where the revolution was victorious. These were not intentionally created by us, but were due to the political and social conditions at the time.
　　Comrade Saifuddin said that the Xinjiang national liberation movement has completed the first stage of its task. With the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang and the establishment of a new democratic government, the Xinjiang national liberation movement has entered a new stage under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In the future, the Xinjiang national liberation movement or the policy on ethnic issues should be to strive for the establishment of equal, friendly, and unified relations between ethnic groups in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Ethnic Relations

　　Regarding ethnic relations, Comrade Saifuddin said that there are thirteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang, namely Uyghur, Kazak, Han, Mongolian, Hui, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Tatar, Tajik, Xibe, Solon, Russian, and Manchu. Some people also count "Taranchi" as an ethnic group, which is incorrect. The so-called "Taranchi" ethnic group is actually only a part of the Uyghur ethnic group. In the mid-17th century, the Manchu Qing government, which conquered the entire Xinjiang, forced more than 8,000 Uyghur households living in southern Xinjiang to move to northern Xinjiang in order to establish a military base in northern Xinjiang. These Uyghurs all farmed for the Manchu Qing as serfs, so they were called "Taranchi" (meaning farmer). Therefore, "Taranchi" was not originally an ethnic title. It was only after Sheng Shicai came to power in Xinjiang in 1935 that he forcibly announced "Taranchi" as an ethnic group based on the opinions of a few stubborn sectarianists. At that time, the Uyghur intellectuals and most of the people living in Yili were against this name. After the national liberation movement achieved victory in Yili, the name "Taranchi" was no longer used.
　　Comrade Saifuddin said that everyone knows that in the past, there was ethnic hatred between the ethnic groups in Xinjiang, between the local ethnic groups and the Han ethnic group. But it should be understood that this ethnic hatred is only the result of the rulers of one ethnic group invading another ethnic group, enslaving them, and carrying out inhuman oppression, massacre, and plunder against them. The people of the ruling ethnic group and the people of the oppressed ethnic group cannot be responsible for this. The rulers who carried out the oppression should be fully responsible. We should also look at the relationship between the local ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the Han ethnic group from this point of view. We must remember that a few reactionary elements within an ethnic group can never represent that ethnic group. We must separate these elements from their ethnic group and regard them as the scum of that ethnic group. In the past, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and their progressive elements (including the Han ethnic group) were well united in the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, showing the consistency of interests. After the liberation of Xinjiang, the enthusiastic welcome of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang is even more evident that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang regard the Han people as their sincere friends.
　　Comrade Saifuddin said that since the Kuomintang regime that created ethnic divisions was eliminated after the liberation of Xinjiang, it has been possible to solve the ethnic relations problem in Xinjiang according to correct principles. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has clearly stipulated that "all ethnic groups within the People's Republic of China are equal, implement unity and mutual assistance, oppose imperialism and the people's enemies within all ethnic groups, and make the People's Republic of China a big family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups." According to this principle, we should resolutely oppose any form of nationalism—great-Han chauvinism or narrow nationalism—and strive to realize the friendship and sincere unity of all ethnic groups. This is our basic policy on ethnic issues.

Current Tasks of the New Alliance

　　Comrade Saifuddin finally talked about the current tasks of the New Alliance, saying that the work in the months after the liberation of Xinjiang was mainly in the organizational aspect: the provincial people's government and the governments at all levels in the province have been reorganized, and representatives of all ethnic groups have been absorbed to participate; the provincial military region has been established, the former ethnic army has joined the People's Liberation Army, and the former Kuomintang troops who revolted have been reorganized into the People's Liberation Army. As a result of measures taken to improve the financial and economic system, the financial and economic problems of Xinjiang Province have also been put on the right track. The task in the future is to find ways to improve the lives of the vast majority of the working people in the province and gradually realize the liberation of the working people. In the future, all work and main forces in the province must be directed towards this goal.
　　The report said that everyone knows that the economic foundation of the province is mainly agriculture, followed by animal husbandry. The farmers are still suffering from serious feudal exploitation. They work hard in the fields all year round, but they cannot get enough food and clothing. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to gradually liberate the working people from the feudal exploitation system. But Xinjiang is an area where many ethnic minorities live, and the situation is more complicated. It is necessary to take a very cautious attitude when carrying out social reforms in such areas, and not to be impatient. The general masses in Xinjiang have a low level of awareness, and the preparation of cadres is not enough. There are still a lack of conditions for carrying out land reform now. Therefore, it is not suitable for Xinjiang to carry out land reform now, and it must be postponed for a period of time. The length of this period depends on the working conditions within the ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the level of awareness of the masses. Now we should strive to prepare these conditions. We will first carry out rent reduction work in some places where the conditions are ripe. To achieve so-called ripe conditions, the first thing is to concentrate efforts to cultivate a group of cadres of this ethnic group who can lead the rent reduction. After each ethnic group has a group of cadres who understand the basic principles of the Chinese revolution and can correctly grasp the rent reduction policy, our rent reduction work can be gradually carried out.
　　Comrade Saifuddin pointed out that the main task of the New Alliance in the future is to mobilize all members, assist the provincial people's government, and strive to restore and develop the national economy destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, to prepare for rent reduction, and to strive for the conditions for carrying out land reform.
　　Comrade Saifuddin said that the New Alliance takes Mao Zedong Thought and the policies of the Chinese Communist Party as the guide for all its work, and takes the thorough realization of New Democracy and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as its goal. Members of the New Alliance must strive for the interests of the Chinese people, for the interests of all ethnic groups in the province, and for the realization of the free and happy life of the people of all ethnic groups in the province.

　　新盟的历史和今后工作任务
    （摘记赛福鼎同志在新疆保卫和平民主同盟代表会议上的政治报告）
    “新疆保卫和平民主同盟”于今年六月上旬在迪化召开了代表会议，总结了该盟自成立以来的工作，并根据目前新疆情况讨论了该盟的改组问题及今后工作方针问题。会议决议该盟改名为“新疆人民民主同盟”，使之成为在中国共产党领导下的新疆各民族先进分子的群众性组织。会议确定该盟今后的任务是团结和领导新疆各民族人民，协助政府，为建设和改革新疆而努力。会议选出五十一人为该盟总委员会委员，以赛福鼎（维吾尔族）为主席，何锐（汉族）、阿不都克里木汉（维吾尔族）、阿尔瓦尔加库林（哈萨克族）为副主席。赛福鼎同志在会上作了一个政治报告。该报告对新盟历史、新疆民族情况及新盟今后工作方针，都作了详细说明。现将该报告的主要内容介绍如下。
                  ——编者
    赛福鼎同志在“新疆保卫和平民主同盟”代表会上的报告，共分目前国际和国内形势，新盟的发展历史及其工作，新疆的民族解放运动，民族关系问题，新盟目前任务等五个部分。
  新盟的发展历史及其工作
    关于新盟的发展历史及其工作，赛福鼎同志介绍说：新盟在过去是一个包括新疆各民族人民的民族统一战线组织，是由于新疆人民革命的需要而产生的。它成立于一九四八年八月一日。是在当时新疆人民革命的根据地——伊犁、阿山、塔城三区成立的。当时新疆有许多秘密的和公开的革命团体，例如解放社、民主革命党、革命青年团、新疆民主联合会等。新盟最初就是在这些团体的基础上组成的。它的领导者原来是新疆民族解放运动领袖阿合买提江等同志（阿合买提江同志于去年九月飞北京途中因飞机失事遇难）。经过两年多的发展，新盟在伊犁、塔城、阿山三区内现已拥有盟员七万七千三百九十四人，已成为一个群众性的政治团体。新盟过去的基本任务，就是把本省的各民族、各民主阶级、各进步人士团结在一个统一战线里面，以有组织的人民的力量，反对统治本省的国民党反动集团，以及为国民党反动集团服务的新疆各民族内部的败类，把人民从痛苦中解放出来，建立民主政权。
    赛福鼎同志说：新盟过去所进行的工作主要是：第一，领导伊犁等三区人民打击了国民党反动派向三区人民所作的军事和经济的进攻，保障了三区人民的安宁的生活。第二，新盟对恢复为国民党反动派所破坏的三区的人民经济、提高人民的经济生活和文化教育水平等方面，也起了重要的领导作用。新盟曾协助三区政府采取了扶助农民的政策，减轻了高利贷对农民的剥削。第三，新盟在三区采取了正确的民族政策，为取得民族间平等友谊的团结而进行了斗争，消除了在国民党统治时期所造成的民族隔阂与仇视。新盟对于国民党反动派及帝国主义间谍在人民大众间所散布的大伊斯兰主义、泛土尔其主义、大民族主义及狭隘民族主义等反动思想进行了一贯的斗争。第四，新盟对自己的盟员及一般人民广泛地宣传了新疆革命运动与全国革命运动的不可分离的一致性，加强了新疆人民对中国人民革命运动和中国共产党的爱戴和同情，这样就造成了新疆革命运动和全国革命运动汇合，以及中国共产党和人民解放军进入新疆的有利条件。赛福鼎同志说：新疆这些工作虽然主要是在三区做的，但都是符合全省人民的利益的，并且对全省人民发生了影响。
    赛福鼎同志说：新盟已为人民作了许多工作，今后新盟仍有继续存在和发展的必要。新盟现在已有了真正的领导者，这个领导者就是以正确的革命理论武装起来且有历史经验的中国共产党。今后新盟的任务就是在中国共产党的领导下，继续为新疆人民的真正解放而斗争，把落后的新疆变为中华人民共和国的一个先进省份。为了适应这个新的需要，所以就必须将新盟加以适当的改组，使它成为在中国共产党领导下的新疆各民族中的先进分子的群众性组织。只有这样，它才能真正担负起领导新疆人民进一步完成新疆人民解放事业的光荣任务。
  新疆的民族解放运动
    关于新疆过去的民族解放运动，赛福鼎同志说：新疆民族解放运动已有近百年的历史。这个运动的目的，就是反对满清政府和国民党反动派在新疆的黑暗专制统治和奴化政策，争取各民族人民的自由解放。一九四四年秋季由伊犁暴动所开始的以国民党反动统治者和新疆民族中的反动分子为对象的新疆民族解放运动，则是一个新的发展。
    赛福鼎同志说：一九四四年秋季在伊犁发起的暴动之所以能够胜利发展，是因为它符合新疆人民的愿望，并受到人民的热烈拥护和支持。伊犁暴动时，革命武装还不到一百人，并且多是以刀子和木棍为武器。但这支武装，终于战胜了数千国民党军队的进攻，并以夺自敌人的武器武装了自己，壮大了自己的力量，最后完全解放了伊犁、阿山、塔城三区。
    赛福鼎同志说：新疆人民的汹涌澎湃的解放斗争，曾迫使国民党反动派不得不在表面上签订给人民以自由的条款。但国民党反动派最后竟违背条款，改组了根据条款组成的新疆省政府，并委任其忠实的走狗麦斯武德为省府主席，将新疆人民的命运重新交给一些民族败类和叛徒们去摆弄。国民党反动派在新疆的大部分地区实行了军事独裁，以“伊犁派”、“东土尔基斯坦”、“共产主义者”、“红蹄子”等罪名，到处逮捕、屠杀和流放人民。国民党反动派对新疆人民的这种镇压行动，是和他们对中国共产党及人民解放军的进攻同时发起的。但国民党反动派的疯狂举动并未能镇压和阻止住人民的革命运动，相反地，整个中国的革命运动和新疆的革命运动，都迅速地发展和壮大起来了。并且由于全国人民革命的胜利，新疆的民族解放运动也获得了胜利。
    赛福鼎同志说：新疆的革命运动是伟大的中国新民主主义革命的一部分。领导新疆革命运动的人，多数是有共产主义思想的革命分子。他们坚持了正确的革命路线，最终使这一革命和中国内地革命相会合。当时我们在革命中尚不能拒绝宗教家们所提出来的宗教口号，且未能在革命胜利的地区进行社会改革，这些并不是我们故意造成的，而是当时的政治与社会条件使然的。
    赛福鼎同志说：新疆的民族解放运动已完成了第一阶段的任务。随着新疆的和平解放和新的民主政府的建立，新疆民族解放运动已在中国共产党的直接领导下进入了一个新的阶段。今后新疆的民族解放运动或是有关民族问题的方针，应该是依照中国人民政协共同纲领的规定，为建立民族间的平等、友爱和统一团结的关系而奋斗。
  民族关系问题
    关于民族关系问题，赛福鼎同志说：新疆共有十三个民族，即维吾尔、哈萨克、汉族、蒙古、回族、吉尔吉兹、乌兹别克、塔塔尔、塔吉克、锡伯、索伦、俄罗斯、满族。有些人把“塔兰其”也算作一个民族，这是不对的。所谓“塔兰其”民族，实际上只是维吾尔民族的一部分。十七世纪中叶，征服了全部新疆的满清政府，为了在北疆建立军事根据地，强迫居住在南疆的八千多户维吾尔族人民移往北疆。这些维吾尔人都以农奴的身份为满清务农，因此就被称作“塔兰其”（即农人之意）。所以“塔兰其”本来不是一个民族称号。只有在一九三五年盛世才在新疆登台后，才根据少数顽固的宗派主义者的意见，硬把“塔兰其”公布作一个民族。当时住在伊犁的维吾尔知识分子及大多数人民都是反对这一名称的，民族解放运动在伊犁取得胜利后，即不再采用“塔兰其”这一名称。
    赛福鼎同志说：大家都知道，过去在新疆的各民族间，地方民族与汉族之间，曾发生过民族仇恨。但应该了解，这种民族仇恨，只是一个民族内部的统治者侵略另一个民族，奴役他们，对他们实行残无人道的压迫、残杀、掠夺的结果。对于这点，统治民族的人民和被压迫民族的人民都不能负责的，完全应由实行压迫的统治者去负责任。我们新疆地方民族与汉族间的关系问题，也应该以这种观点去看。我们要牢记，一个民族内部的少数反动分子，决不能代表这一个民族，要把这些分子和其所属的民族分开来，把他们看作是那一民族的败类。过去新疆各民族人民及其进步分子（汉族也包括在内），在反对国民党反动派的斗争中，曾很好地团结在一起，表现了利益的一致。新疆解放以后，新疆各民族人民热烈欢迎中国共产党和人民解放军的情形，更足见新疆各民族人民把汉族人民看作是自己真挚的朋友。
    赛福鼎同志说：自从新疆获得解放，制造民族分裂的国民党政权被消灭之后，新疆民族关系问题已有可能按照正确的原则加以解决。中国人民政协共同纲领已经明确规定：“中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。”按照这一原则，我们应该坚决反对任何样式的民族主义——大民族主义或狭隘民族主义，为实现各民族的友谊及精诚团结而奋斗。这就是我们对民族问题的基本方针。
  新盟目前的任务
    赛福鼎同志最后论到新盟目前任务时说：新疆解放以后几个月来的工作，主要是在组织方面：省人民政府及全省各级政府都已改组，吸收了各族人民代表参加；省军区已经建立，前民族军已加入人民解放军，起义的前国民党部队已改编为人民解放军。由于采取措施改善财政经济制度的结果，新疆省的财政经济问题也已走上轨道。今后的任务，就是设法改善全省绝大多数劳动人民的生活，有步骤地实现劳动人民的解放。今后本省的一切工作及主要力量都要针对着这一目标。
    报告说：大家都知道，本省的经济基础主要是农业，其次是畜牧业。农民还受着严重的封建剥削，他们终年在田地上辛苦劳动，但不得温饱。所以，设法使劳动人民逐渐从封建剥削制度下解放出来，是必要的。但新疆是一个许多少数民族聚居的区域，情形比较复杂。在这样的地区进行社会改革，必须采取十分慎重的态度，而不可性急。新疆一般群众觉悟程度较低，干部的准备也不够，现在还缺乏进行土地改革的条件。因此，新疆现在还不适于进行土地改革，而必须把它推迟一个时期，这个时期的长短要看新疆各民族内部的工作情况和群众的觉悟程度如何而定。现在我们应当为准备这些条件而努力。我们将先在一些条件成熟的地方进行减租的工作。要达到所谓条件成熟，首先就是要集中力量培养一批领导减租的本民族的干部。在各民族自己都有了一批懂得中国革命基本道理并能正确地掌握减租政策的干部以后，我们的减租工作就可逐渐地展开。
    赛福鼎同志指出：新盟今后的主要任务就是动员全体盟员，协助本省人民政府，为恢复与发展被国民党反动派所破坏的国民经济，为进行减租的准备工作和争取进行土地改革的条件而努力。
    赛福鼎同志说：新盟以毛泽东思想和中国共产党的政策作为自己一切工作的指针，以彻底实现新民主主义和人民政协共同纲领为自己的目标。新盟盟员必须为中国人民的利益，为本省各民族的利益，为实现本省各民族人民的自由幸福的生活而努力奋斗。
