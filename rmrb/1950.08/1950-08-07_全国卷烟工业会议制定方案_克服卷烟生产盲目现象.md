　　National Tobacco Industry Conference Formulates Plan to Overcome Blindness in Cigarette Production
    【Xinhua News Agency, 5th】The National Tobacco Industry Conference, based on the current production and sales situation of the cigarette industry, has formulated a plan on how to overcome the blindness and anarchy in cigarette production in the future. The conference was convened by the Central Ministry of Food Industry and was held from July 18th to 29th. Ninety-five representatives from industrial departments and public and private cigarette factories from various regions attended.
    According to the conference's estimates, the current national cigarette production is approximately 2.5 million cases per year. If all equipment is fully operational, operating for nine hours a day, it could reach 4.2 million cases. However, the current national peak cigarette sales volume is only 1.8 million to 1.9 million cases.
    In order to overcome the blind development of the cigarette industry, the plan formulated by the conference stipulates that, except with the approval of the Central People's Government, local governments shall not approve the establishment of new mechanized cigarette factories and handicraft cigarette workshops in the future. Factories that have been closed down and whose trademark business licenses have been revoked cannot be reinstated. Factory relocation also requires the approval of the Central People's Government. The plan stipulates the cigarette production and sales figures for each region from July to the end of December this year are: Northeast 78,000 cases (one case contains 50,000 cigarettes), North China 88,000 cases, East China 394,000 cases, Central South 270,000 cases, Southwest 65,000 cases, Northwest 3,000 cases, and Inner Mongolia 2,000 cases, totaling 900,000 cases.
    In addition, the plan makes clear provisions for issues such as the promotion of cigarettes, the profit margins of manufacturers and vendors, the purchase of tobacco leaves, and the grading of cigarettes.
    The conference also suggested that a national tobacco industry management organization be established as soon as possible to unify policy control and guide business operations.

　　全国卷烟工业会议制定方案
    克服卷烟生产盲目现象
    【新华社五日讯】全国卷烟工业会议根据目前卷烟工业的产销情况，已制定关于今后如何克服卷烟生产盲目性和无政府状态的方案。会议系由中央食品工业部召集，于七月十八日至二十九日举行。出席者有各地区工业部门及公私营烟厂代表九十五人。
    据会议的估计，目前全国烟卷产量每年约为二百五十万箱；如全部设备一齐开动，每天开工九小时，则可达四百二十万箱。但目前全国最高销烟量却仅为一百八十万箱到一百九十万箱。
    为克服卷烟工业的盲目发展现象，会议制定的方案中规定：除中央人民政府批准外，今后各地方政府一律不得再批准增设机制卷烟工厂和手工业卷烟作坊。已停业工厂中，商标营业执照已经注销者不能再请复工。迁厂时亦需经中央人民政府批准。该方案规定今年七月至十二月底各区卷烟产销数目是：东北七万八千箱（一箱为五万支），华北八万八千箱，华东三十九万四千箱，中南二十七万箱，西南六万五千箱，西北三千箱，内蒙二千箱。总计九十万箱。
    此外该方案对卷烟的推销、制造和贩卖厂商的利润率、烟叶的收购和烟卷的分级等问题都作了明确规定。
    会议并建议尽速成立全国卷烟工业管理机构，以统一掌握政策，领导业务进行。
