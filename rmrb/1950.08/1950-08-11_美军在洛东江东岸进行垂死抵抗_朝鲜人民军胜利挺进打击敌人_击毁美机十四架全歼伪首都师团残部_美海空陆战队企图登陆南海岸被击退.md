Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th - The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a war report on the morning of the 10th that US troops have concentrated all their forces on the east bank of the Nakdong River, constructing strong defensive positions and continuing to put up a last-ditch resistance. The various arms of the People's Army, in close coordination, are fiercely attacking the enemy, striking US tank mechanized infantry and naval forces, as well as the remaining troops of the Lee Seung-man puppet army. On the southern coast, the People's Army has shattered the US Marine Corps' attempt to land under the cover of tanks and infantry, as well as naval bombardment, and continues to wage a fierce offensive. The People's Army Air Force has bombed the enemy's concentrated forces, transport teams, and vehicles, cutting off the enemy's retreat and inflicting heavy losses, while covering the advance of the People's Army ground forces. The General Headquarters of the People's Army announced on the evening of the 10th that the People's Army units on the east coast, having completely annihilated the so-called Capital Division of the Lee Seung-man puppet army, are continuing their offensive while mopping up the remaining puppet troops in the area.

The People's Army units advancing on the southern sea front defeated the US infantry units conducting several counter-attacks under the cover of ten tanks, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. At the same time, they fiercely fired on two transport ships carrying the remaining troops of the Lee Seung-man puppet army and police force attempting to land on a nearby coast, sinking one and causing the other to flee in panic.
