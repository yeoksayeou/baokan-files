　　The Responsibilities of the United Nations Security Council
    Reader Comrade Shomova (Voroshilovgrad) requests an explanation: What are the responsibilities of the United Nations Security Council, and what is it doing now?

    The United Nations Charter stipulates that the Security Council's major responsibility is to maintain international peace and security.

    The Security Council is composed of eleven member states: five permanent members and six non-permanent members. The permanent members are the Soviet Union, China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The non-permanent members are elected by the United Nations General Assembly every two years. Any proposal must be approved by a vote of the five permanent members and no fewer than two non-permanent members to pass.

    The principle of unanimity among the five major powers in the Security Council is the foundation of all UN activities. Its responsibility is to ensure equal rights for all countries. According to the UN Charter, no major power may use behind-the-scenes conspiracies or methods of oppressing other countries (as bourgeois diplomacy often does) to force the Security Council to pass resolutions that suit it against the will of other countries.

    The imperialist countries have long used their untenable arguments to create a principle of unanimity, and at the same time, have gradually attempted to turn the Security Council into a tool of their policies. The vigilance of the Soviet representative prevented the realization of the imperialists' intentions when discussing issues such as Spain, Indonesia, Greece, and others.

    Now, the American ruling clique, attempting to use the United Nations' signboard to cover up its armed intervention in Korea, has further undermined the United Nations Charter. Representatives from the Soviet Union and China did not attend Security Council meetings. The U.S. government obstructs the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China, but supports Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang representatives, the fascist group who had already been driven out of China. The Soviet Union cannot reconcile itself to such illegal actions and cannot attend the Security Council.

    Therefore, two permanent members of the Security Council, the Soviet Union and China, did not participate in Security Council meetings. Of course, any resolutions passed in the absence of the Soviet Union and China cannot have legal effect.

    When a struggle occurs between two groups in a country, the United Nations Charter prohibits the Security Council from interfering in the internal affairs of that country. The Security Council's intervention in the internal affairs of Korea violates the most important principles of the United Nations Charter.

    The American ruling clique has turned the Security Council into a tool for provoking war, and its actions are contrary to the original purpose of establishing the United Nations. Recently, the American imperialists and their agents, in the name of the Security Council, announced a shameful "decision" to use the United Nations flag to cover up American aggression in Korea. The illegality of this action goes without saying.

    Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko stated in a statement regarding the U.S. armed intervention in Korea: "The illegal resolution passed by the Security Council on June 27 under pressure from the American government shows that the Security Council is not fulfilling its major responsibility of maintaining peace, but is acting as a tool used by the American ruling clique to launch wars."

    The U.S. imperialist agents in the United Nations are causing the Security Council to engage in hostile actions against peace. As Gromyko said in his statement: "The United Nations organization can only fulfill its responsibility to maintain peace if the Security Council demands an unconditional cessation of American military intervention and the immediate withdrawal of American armed forces from Korea."

### 联合国安全理事会的职责

　　联合国安全理事会的职责
    读者叔莫瓦同志（沃罗希洛夫格勒）要求解释：联合国安全理事会有怎样的职责，现在它在作什么？
    联合国宪章规定：安全理事会的重大责任，在于维持国际和平与安全。
    安全理事会是由十一个会员国组成的：五国常任理事国和六个非常任理事国。常任理事国有苏联、中国、法国、英国和美国，非常任理事国每两年由联合国大会改选一次。任何议案须有五个常任理事国和不能少于两个非常任理事国投票赞成才能通过。
    安全理事会中五个大国一致的原则是联合国全部活动的基础。它的职责是保证各国的权利平等。按照联合国宪章的规定，任何一个大国不得用幕后的阴谋或压迫其他国家的方法（资产阶级的外交时常干这种勾当），强使安全理事会通过适合它的决议来反对其他国家的意志。
    帝国主义国家早就用自己说不过去的论点作成了一致的原则，同时，逐步企图把安全理事会变成自己政策的工具。在讨论西班牙、印度尼西亚、希腊和其他问题的时候，苏联代表的警戒才阻止了帝国主义者的意图的实现。
    现在，企图利用联合国招牌来掩饰自己在朝鲜的武装干涉的美国统治集团，进一步破坏了联合国宪章。苏联和中国的代表都没有出席安全理事会会议。美国政府阻挠中华人民共和国代表参加，却支持已被逐出中国的蒋介石法西斯集团的国民党代表蒋廷黻。苏联不能与这种违法的行动相调和，也就不能出席安全理事会。
    所以，安全理事会的两个常任理事国，苏联和中国没有参加安全理事会会议。当然，在苏联和中国缺席的情况下所通过的任何决议，不能具有法律的效力。
    当一个国家中发生两个团体之间的斗争时，联合国宪章禁止安全理事会干涉这个国家的内部事情。安全理事会对朝鲜内部事情的干涉破坏了联合国宪章最重要的原则。
    美国统治集团把安全理事会变为挑拨战争的工具，它的行动违背着从前创立联合国的目的。  近来，美帝国主义者们和他们的代理人们，以安全理事会的名义公布了关于利用联合国的旗帜来掩饰美国在朝鲜的侵略的可耻的“决定”。这种行动的非法是无需多说的。
    苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯在关于美帝武装干涉朝鲜的声明中说：“安理会六月二十七日在美国政府压迫下，通过的非法决议案，表明安理会不是在执行其负有维持和平这一重大责任的机构的职务，而是充当美国统治集团利用来发动战争的工具。”
    联合国中的美帝代理人使安全理事会从事敌视和平的行动。正如葛罗米柯在声明中所说：“联合国组织只有在安理会要求无条件停止美国军事干涉与立即从朝鲜撤退美国武装部队的情况下，才能履行其维护和平的职责。”
