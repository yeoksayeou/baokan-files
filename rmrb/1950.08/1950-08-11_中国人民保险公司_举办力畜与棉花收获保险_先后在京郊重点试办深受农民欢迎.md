China People's Insurance Company
Launches Livestock and Cotton Harvest Insurance
Deeply Welcomed by Farmers After Pilot Programs in Key Beijing Suburbs

[This Newspaper] The China People's Insurance Company's planned livestock insurance (reported on page 2 of this newspaper on April 17), has been piloted in key areas of the Beijing suburbs and Luanbei District in Shandong Province. After gaining experience, it will be widely promoted in various regions across the country.

This insurance business of the company is an important part of various agricultural insurance programs launched to cooperate with the government's agricultural production increase plan. In the initial stage, the target is temporarily four kinds of draught animals: cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys (restricted to those used for cultivation or transportation). The insured disasters are divided into four categories: (1) Death due to infectious diseases or ordinary internal and surgical diseases; (2) Death due to violent and obvious accidental trauma; (3) Death due to childbirth or castration; (4) Death due to fire and electric shock. Among them, the first item is the main one, and the remaining items can be insured additionally according to individual needs. The insured amount is up to 80% of the actual price of the livestock. In the five provinces of North China and the five provinces of Northwest China, millet is temporarily used as the calculation standard. In East China, Central South China and Southwest China, rice is temporarily used as the calculation standard. The insurance period is temporarily set for one year, and renewal can be requested upon expiration.

Starting in May, the company's business department, under the close cooperation of the Beijing Municipal Suburban District Working Committee, district and village people's governments, and farmers' associations, selected the 13th and 14th districts of Beijing suburbs to conduct key pilot projects on livestock insurance. Extensive publicity and explanation work was carried out in advance to make farmers realize that livestock insurance is indeed the best way to compensate for accidental losses caused by livestock deaths, thereby ensuring that agricultural production will not be interrupted. Key pilot programs began in early June. In just over 20 days, 116 livestock in these two districts have been insured. In order to take care of the actual situation of farmers, the company also agreed that insurance premiums can be paid after the wheat harvest to show preferential treatment.

In addition, in order to protect livestock safety, the company has entrusted the Beijing General Station of Agricultural University to handle livestock inspection, epidemic prevention, and medical treatment. All insured livestock will be regularly inspected by the station once a month in the future. Undoubtedly, with the progress of livestock insurance, veterinary work will be more popular. This will be very beneficial to the development of agricultural production in our country.

[Also News] In order to cooperate with the government's cotton planting plan, the China People's Insurance Company has recently launched cotton harvest insurance to compensate for the loss of cotton harvest due to various agricultural disasters. The main points of this insurance method are: 1. The scope of protection basically includes various disasters such as waterlogging, insect pests, wind disasters, freezing disasters, frost disasters, and diseases; hail disasters must be specially insured. 2. The harvest of seed cotton (including lint cotton and cottonseed) is the insured object. 3. State-owned farms in various places, farmers' organizations with collective organizations, and general farmers can all be insured. 4. The underwriting limit is temporarily based on 50% of the planned harvest amount for the current year for state-owned farms. For farmers, it is temporarily based on 60% of their past average harvest. The insurance premium is 3.5% of the insured amount, and an additional 1.5% is charged for hail insurance. Both the insured amount and the insurance premium are calculated based on physical objects (such as a certain number of catties of seed cotton), and then converted into RMB at the wholesale market price at that time. 5. The insurance period starts after cotton is sown and ends after harvesting, or no later than November 1st (North China). 6. When the actual harvest of seed cotton does not reach its insured amount due to disasters mentioned in Article 1, the insurance company will compensate for the reduced harvest amount.

Cotton harvest insurance has begun to be piloted in the southern suburbs of Beijing. After gaining experience, it will be promoted in all cotton-growing areas across the country. Since the opening of insurance in Beijing suburbs in June, it has been highly valued by farmers. By the beginning of July, 21 households, including Liu Wenkui from Wudian Village, District 14, had insured 3,525 catties of seed cotton harvest insurance on 78.5 mu of cotton fields. This kind of crop harvest insurance business is still a pioneering work in our country.

　　中国人民保险公司
    举办力畜与棉花收获保险
    先后在京郊重点试办深受农民欢迎
    【本报讯】中国人民保险公司计划中的力畜保险（本报四月十七日二版曾有报道），已在京市郊区和山东省滦北区重点试办，取得经验后，将在全国各区普遍推行。
    该公司此项保险业务，系为配合政府农业增产计划而举办的各种农业保险中很重要的一种。在初创时期，暂以牛、马、骡、驴四种力畜为对象（限制用于耕种或驮运者）。承保的灾害分为四项：（一）因患传染病或普通内外科疾病而死亡者；（二）因遭遇外来剧烈及明显之意外触伤而死亡者；（三）因胎产或阉割而死亡者；（四）因火灾及触电而死亡者。其中第一项是主要的，其余各项则可视各人需要附加投保。保险金额以牲畜实际价格的八成为最高额。在华北五省及西北五省一律暂按小米计算，华东区、中南区及西南区则暂按大米计算。保险期限暂定一年，期满得请求续保。
    从五月份开始，该公司营业部即在京市郊区工作委员会、区村人民政府及农会的密切合作下，选择京郊第十三、四两区，对力畜保险作了重点试办。事先广泛进行了宣传解释工作，使农民认识了力畜保险确是补偿牲口死亡所遭致之意外损失，借以保障农业生产不致中辍的最好办法。六月初旬开始重点试办，仅二十余天工夫，该两区即已有牲口一百十六匹，进行了保险。为照顾到农民的实际情况，该公司并同意保险费可于麦收后缴清，以示优待。
    又该公司为保障牲畜安全，现已委托农业大学北京工作总站办理牲畜的检查、防疫和医疗工作。凡属保过险的牲畜，今后将由该站每月作定期检查一次。无疑的，随着力畜保险的进展，兽医工作也更将普及。这对发展我国农业生产将是十分有利的。
    【又讯】中国人民保险公司为配合政府的增植棉花计划，近又开办棉花收获保险，借以补偿因各种农业灾害所遭致之棉花收获量的损失。此项保险办法的要点是：一，保障范围基本上包括过湿、虫害、风灾、冻灾、霜灾、病害等各种灾害；雹灾须特约附保。二，以籽棉（包括皮棉及棉籽二者）之收获量为保险标的。三，各地国营农场，有集体组织之农民团体，及一般农民，皆得为投保人。四，承保限额，对国营农场暂以其本年度计划收获量的百分之五十为原则。对农民暂以其过去平均收获量的百分之六十为原则，保险费是保险额的百分之三·五，附保雹险者加费百分之一·五。保险额和保险费，都以实物为计算标准（如籽棉若干市斤），再按当时批发市价折成人民币。五，保险期间，自棉花下种后开始，至收摘后，或至迟十一月一日（华北区）终止。六，籽棉之实际收获量，因遭受第一条所述灾害，未达其保险额时，即由保险公司赔偿其减收数。
    棉花收获保险，已在京市南郊开始重点试办，取得经验后，即将在全国各植棉地区内推广。京郊自六月开办保险以来，很受农民重视。到七月初旬已有第十四区庑殿村农民刘文魁等二十一户，在七十八亩半的棉田上，投保了收获险籽棉三千五百二十五市斤。此种农作物收获保险业务在我国尚属创举。
