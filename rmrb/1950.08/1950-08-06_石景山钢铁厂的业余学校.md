　　The Amateur School of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    By Our Reporter Mu Yang
    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's amateur school, with 2,000 students, was established on the foundation of the former political training classes and literacy classes. Since its official opening on April 3rd, all students have generally improved their cultural knowledge. Among them, nearly a thousand students in the first and third sessions of the elementary classes, who were illiterate or semi-literate, have learned to recognize between two hundred and five hundred characters and have applied their acquired cultural knowledge to their production work.

    At a recent small-scale symposium, these workers who had culturally turned over a new leaf vividly compared their situations before and after participating in the studies, based on their own personal experiences. Guo Demao, a worker in the Power Department, had been an apprentice in the electrical trade since he was young and couldn't recognize a single character. When he went out to install electric lights, he always had to ask others to write and calculate how much material was used and how much it all cost. After coming to the Iron and Steel Plant, he once received a work ticket to go to the South Plant, but because he couldn't read and didn't hear clearly, he ran to the North Plant, wasting several trips back and forth and delaying his work. Embarrassed and making a fool of himself, Guo Demao had long wanted to learn culture, but before liberation, "Neither the Japanese nor the Kuomintang cared about such things!" Guo Demao said, "Work was so busy and tiring that you didn't even have time to study yourself!" Now, after three months of study, he can already recognize about two hundred characters. Speaking of this, Old Guo couldn't stop smiling. He said, "In the past, we only knew our own names and couldn't write them. If someone wrote 'dog' or 'cat' for us, we wouldn't know it either. Now we can write, and we can recognize the names of many classmates, so we don't have to be embarrassed anymore!"

    Construction worker Wang Lianzeng was also someone who had suffered since childhood and had never gone to school, and he had encountered many difficult situations: when he first came to Shijingshan, he took the wrong train to Mentougou because he couldn't read, and had to walk back because he didn't have money to buy a ticket. Wang Lianzeng felt both amused and angry when he mentioned this incident. He said, "Poor people have no say, and people without culture have no say either; afterwards, when we mentioned this to others, they said that the station had huge characters written on it, who told you not to recognize them?" But now, Old Wang, who already recognizes four hundred characters, has no problem reading notices, finding street names, writing notes, or writing a wall newspaper article.

    There are countless examples of workers applying their learned knowledge to production: many workers in the coking department couldn't calculate the ash percentage of coke in the past, but now they can after learning arithmetic. Zhang Guoshu, a worker in the casting department, used to be unable to calculate the gear teeth and had to wait for the foreman to calculate it for him, which often delayed a lot of time; now he only needs ten minutes to calculate it himself. Sun Xinfu, a worker in the naphthalene workshop, used to often calculate the percentages of products incorrectly, and his daily reports often contained words that others couldn't understand, but now he hasn't made a mistake for a long time. The workers in the coking department's repair shop used to use clumsy methods to measure steel rods with a ruler, but now they use division to calculate.

    The students are all industrial workers with particularly heavy workloads, complex work natures, and inconsistent working hours, and there are also some temporary workers. To ensure that each of the 2,000 students in such a school learns well requires meticulous organizational work. The Iron and Steel Plant's amateur school has taken the following steps and achieved the above-mentioned results. First, the school has established three branch schools based on the characteristics of the plant, so that workers can attend classes as close to their workplaces as possible. The general study time is set from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; irregular shift workers are divided into directly affiliated classes and attend classes according to their work schedules. In addition, a field study class has also been established. This is one of the prerequisites for ensuring that students can attend regularly. Second, eliminate absenteeism and reduce requests for leave. At the end of April, the total absenteeism rate of students reached as high as 30%, and individual classes reached 40%. Those who missed classes also lost confidence in learning because they couldn't catch up with others; the phenomenon of absenteeism increased rather than decreased. Overtime, meetings, and irregular shifts were the direct causes of absenteeism. To this end, the school appealed to the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League for assistance. At the same time, three tasks were carried out: first, a tutoring system similar to that of "little teachers": generally, tutoring sessions were held collectively in the workplace at a certain time, those who missed classes asked those with good grades for help; those who couldn't do it asked the teachers for help. The second is a make-up class system: they used a variety of methods, some teachers outside of class, some during rest periods before and between classes, and some went deep into the field to provide make-up classes collectively or individually for those who missed classes. The third is extensive mobilization and encouragement work: mobilization work was carried out by groups, understanding the reasons for each person's absence and encouraging them to attend. Encouragement work was carried out on a class-by-class basis, launching a red flag campaign for those who did not miss classes without reason, and then electing model groups and establishing an attendance system. After the above work was carried out, the school's absenteeism rate immediately dropped to below 25%, and sometimes even less than 20%. Third, good teaching by teachers is a prerequisite for good learning by students. When school first started, many teaching problems were discovered. The Academic Affairs Office divided the school's 50 teachers into three research groups according to their professional nature: Chinese language, arithmetic, and general knowledge, and set up subgroups with full-time teachers as the backbone. Through them, part-time teachers were contacted to jointly study political theory and professional experiences from other places. Before teaching a new lesson, everyone prepared lesson plans separately, and after selecting a typical lesson plan, they went to teach separately. However, a month later, it was found that many teachers could not teach according to the lesson plans, so from May, a lesson preparation system was implemented: everyone first studied the content, key points, and progress of this lesson in the professional research meeting, and then taught according to the conclusion. The result of this was that the progress of courses at the same level was uniform, the teaching objectives were clear, and the effect was greatly improved compared to before. This is how the Iron and Steel Plant's amateur school ensures good teaching by teachers and good learning by students.

　　石景山钢铁厂的业余学校
    本报记者  穆扬
    有二千名学员的石景山钢铁厂业余学校，是在从前的政治训练班与识字班的基础上建立起来的。该校从四月三日正式开课以来，全体学员在文化知识上已普遍提高一步。其中近千名初级班一期与三期的文盲与半文盲学员，都认识了二百到五百个字，并把学得的文化知识应用到生产工作上去。
    在最近的一次小型座谈会上，这些在文化上翻了身的工人们，曾以自己的切身体验突出地对比了参加学习前后的情况。动力部工人郭德茂从小在电科行当学徒，一个大字不识。他出去按装电灯，用了多少料，一共多少钱，写写算算总得求人家。来到钢铁厂后，有一次领了去南厂的工票，自己不识字，又没听清楚，跑到北厂去了，来回白走了几趟冤枉道，还耽误了活。作难闹笑话，郭德茂早就想学文化了，但在解放以前，“日本人和国民党谁来管你这些事呢？”郭德茂说，“工作忙得累死人，你想自己学都没空！”现在，经过了三个月的学习，他已经认识了二百来个字。说到这里，老郭笑得闭不上嘴。他说：“过去咱光知道自己叫什么，不会写。人家给咱写个狗、写个猫咱也不知道。现在会写了，许多同学的名字咱也认的了，不再作那份难了！”
    建筑工王连增也是从小受苦没念过书的人，作难事也碰到过不少：他才来石景山的时候，就因为不识字，坐火车错坐到门头沟，没钱买票走回来的。王连增一提起这件事，又好笑又生气，他说：“人穷没理，没文化也没理；赶后咱向别人提起这件事，人家还说站上写着斗大的字，谁让你不认的？”可是现在已经认识了四百个字的老王，看布告、找街名、开便条、写个壁报稿子都不成问题了。
    经过学习的工人们把学到的知识用到生产上去的例子，也举不胜举：炼焦部的很多工人，过去都不会算焦炭的含灰百分比，学过算术后都会算了。铸造部工人张国枢，过去不会算牙轮，等着领班的来替自己算，常常耽误很多时间；现在自己算只需要十分钟。制萘房工人孙薪夫，过去常把产品的百分比算错，日报表上也常发现些让别人看不懂的字，现在他已经有很长的时间没有出过错。炼焦部修理房的工人们过去截钢棍，总是使笨法子用尺子量，现在是用除法算了。
    学员们都是工作特别繁重的产业工人，工作性质复杂，工作时间也不一致，且还有一部分临时工人。这样一个拥有两千名学员的学校，若能使每个学员学好，是需要精密的组织工作的。钢铁厂业余学校采取了以下几个步骤，获得了上述成绩。一、学校首先根据本厂的特点设立了三个分校，使工人们尽量就近上课。学习时间一般的规定在每周一、三、五的晚七时至九时；不规律的倒班工人就分别划分为校直属班，随着上下工的时间上课。另外还设了一个现场学习班。这是保证学员能够经常出席的先决条件之一。二、消灭旷课、减少请假。四月底，学员的总缺度率曾高达百分之三十，个别班达百分之四十。缺课的人还因拉下课追不上别人而丧失学习信心；缺席现象有增无减。加班、开会、不规律的倒班是缺课的直接原因。为此，学校一方面提请党、政、工、团加以照顾。同时也展开了三个工作：第一是一种类似小先生制的温课制度：一般的以工作现场为单位，在一定时间集体温课，拉下课的向功课好的请教；都不会的请教教师。第二是补课制度：他们利用了多种多样的方式，有的教员在课外，有的则利用课前与课间的休息时间，有的则深入现场为拉下课的集体或个别补课。第三是广泛的动员工作与鼓动工作：动员工作由小组分工负责，了解每个人的缺课原因，动员他们出席。鼓动工作以班为单位进行无故不缺课的争红旗运动，进而选举模范小组，建立考勤制度。上述工作开展后，全校缺课率即降至百分之二十五以下，有时还不足百分之二十。三、教员教好是学员学好的先决条件。刚开学时发现许多教学上的问题，教务处即将全校五十名教师按业务性质划分为国语、算术、常识三个研究会，并分设小组，以专任教师为骨干，通过他们，联系兼任教员，共同学习政治理论与其他各地的业务经验。在讲一课新书前，大家分别作教案，在选出典型教案后再分头去教。但一个月后又发现不少教师不能按着教案进行教学，于是，从五月份起改行备课制度：大家先在业务研究会上研究这一课书的内容、重点、进度等，然后根据结论教课。这样作的结果是同级的课程进度齐一、教学目的明确，效果比前大为提高。钢铁厂业余学校就是这样来保证教员教好和学员学好的。
