　　Public-Private Consultation, Balancing Production and Sales
    Remembering the National Grain Processing Conference
    By our reporter Kang Weizhong
    China's flour milling industry has a large production capacity. In the past, the flour milling industry was never fully operational, nor did it develop production plans based on domestic flour consumption, resulting in long-term blindness. After prices stabilized and false purchasing power disappeared in March of this year, a serious temporary overproduction of flour occurred. In light of this situation, in order to solve the problem of balancing production and sales, the Central Trade Department convened a national conference of representatives from public and private flour milling enterprises to jointly determine production based on sales under the principle of overall consideration, in order to achieve a balance between flour production and sales nationwide. This grain processing conference, which lasted twenty-seven days from July 11th to August 6th, successfully resolved this issue.
    What exactly is the production capacity of China's flour milling industry? According to statistics, there are 597 public and private flour mills across the country (excluding the Northeast region) (100 public and 497 private). If they were to produce 485,162 bags every 24 hours, monthly production (based on 22 days per month) would reach over 10.67 million bags, and annual production (12 months) would be over 128 million bags. However, actual national consumption is still quite small. According to statistics from June of last year to the end of May this year, the estimated actual sales volume nationwide is only about 48 million bags, accounting for more than 37 percent of the national production capacity.
    Comparing the actual production volume of over 53.66 million bags with the actual sales volume in the previous year (June of last year to May of this year), the phenomenon of imbalance between production and sales becomes even more obvious. The operating rates of flour mills in various regions were unbalanced in the previous year. The actual production volume in East China accounted for only 29.82 percent of the region's production capacity. Shandong Province within East China accounted for only 38.13 percent, Central South accounted for only 24.59 percent, Southwest accounted for 25.1 percent, Northwest accounted for 70 percent, and North China accounted for 72.8 percent. From the above figures, the actual production volume in the previous year was far from the actual production capacity. And the actual consumption volume was even lower. As of the end of May this year, North China had a surplus of over 2.357 million bags of flour, Central South had a surplus of over 1.74 million bags, and Shandong in East China had a surplus of 550,000 bags. East China had the lowest operating rate, so the surplus was only 555,000 bags. In total, the surplus flour in the previous year reached over 5.2 million bags.
    Judging from the current production capacity of China's flour milling industry and the huge consumption of a population of nearly 500 million, today's flour production is still insignificant. But why is there overproduction?
    This is because China's flour milling industry blindly developed during the Kuomintang bandit gang's long-term inflation and when flour was an object for speculative capitalists to hoard and manipulate. In addition, some large and medium-sized cities were concentrated areas of Kuomintang bureaucratic institutions, parasitic fugitive landlords, and large reactionary troops, resulting in swollen populations. When prices fluctuated sharply, the unscrupulous merchants stirred up trouble and competed to purchase flour, and flour production was built on this false prosperity. On the other hand, the Kuomintang bandit gang's cruel exploitation during its rule, the poverty of the rural people, and their low purchasing power, coupled with the rural custom of using home-made flour and the lack of coordination between urban and rural areas, limited the flour sales market to large and medium-sized cities. Although this phenomenon has been adjusted to some extent since liberation, it has not yet been brought onto a rational track. Due to the above reasons, the sales of flour showed a serious overproduction phenomenon after prices stabilized and false purchasing power disappeared in March of this year.
    How to adjust these unreasonable phenomena and eliminate blindness to achieve a balance between flour production and sales is the most important task at present. The representatives of the flour milling industry from various places had a heated debate at the conference on the two issues of "determining production based on sales" or "determining sales based on production." Some representatives suggested that this year's national wheat production reached 38.8 billion jin, and it is estimated that after deducting farmers' own consumption, payment of public grain, and seed retention, there is a surplus of 5.89 billion jin. If farmers keep 40 percent of the surplus grain, there are still 60 percent, or 3.534 billion jin, for sale. In addition, the public grain for this year's finances can approximately supply the operation of the entire national flour milling industry. Therefore, they hoped that in order to take care of the current production difficulties of the flour milling industry, it should "determine sales based on production" to achieve full processing. However, most representatives disagreed with full operation. They believed that if the flour industry "determined sales based on production" this year, it would inevitably lead to a more serious overproduction phenomenon than last year. As one representative said: "This kind of overproduction will lead to blind competition between producers and distributors, drive down prices, and as a result, both the public and private sectors will suffer and the factories will collapse." To avoid this huge loss, they believed that it is necessary to "determine production based on sales" and achieve "balanced production and sales, planned operation."
    The final conclusions all focused on the issue of balancing production and sales. How to balance production and sales? This is another complex issue.
    In principle, the representatives from various places based their calculations on the total national flour sales volume from June of last year to May of this year as a base figure. But on the other hand, they also took into account the new situation in the market this year. For example, the people's governments in various places have vigorously carried out the adjustment of public-private relations and reduced taxes, which has caused the economic situation in various places to gradually improve, and the real purchasing power in the market has gradually manifested itself. Based on their recent actual flour operations, the representatives from various places estimated that the sales volume in the market may increase by about 10 percent compared to before, and therefore extrapolated that this year's sales volume would increase to 53,333,303 bags. In addition, China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO), focusing on taking special care of the particularly difficult situation in East China, increased the processing of flour by 797,157 bags on top of the original plan. In total, the production quantity for this year is 54,100,460 bags. This is the scope of national flour production for this year (June of this year to May of next year). This production quantity is a production plan that is accurately formulated based on the possible sales volume this year, so as to achieve a balance between production and sales and put the flour industry on the track of planned operation.
    The national flour production plan has been determined. The representatives further negotiated the production volume and operating rate of each region based on the planned number and the actual production and consumption situation in each region. This caused another heated debate. The representatives from various places unanimously emphasized the difficulties of their respective regions and hoped to receive more consideration. Some advocated that flour processing should focus on the areas where raw materials are produced and the areas where finished products are sold, and should be focused processing. But others suggested that flour processing should be uniformly increased or decreased, uniformly distributed, and processed according to the existing production capacity of each region.
    However, the conclusions of the debate all converged on the principle of "overall consideration and each getting its due." It can be affirmed that China's flour milling industry will not be in surplus in the future, and its existence has a future.
    In the sales market, the representatives of the flour industry in North China, in the spirit of "mutual care," first gave up a portion of the flour processed in the region. The Northwest region also voluntarily gave up a portion due to the difficulty in selling flour. North China gave up 7.3 percent of its existing operating rate; the Northwest region gave up 17.4 percent of its existing operating rate. These ceded portions, coupled with the increased portion under the new situation this year, allowed East China, Shandong in East China, and Central South to appropriately increase their operating rates, solving their difficulties in insufficient production. For example, East China increased from an operating rate of 29.82 percent in the previous year to 32.6 percent; Shandong Province in East China increased from an operating rate of 38.13 percent in the previous year to 42.2 percent. Central South had the lowest operating rate in the past, so the increase was also greater this time. The operating rate of the region was 24.59 percent in the previous year, and it has now increased to 35.5 percent, an actual increase of 11 percent. The representatives unanimously expressed satisfaction with the distribution of flour processing.
    Another issue closely related to flour production is the unified formulation of the market division of the flour market based on the state's free trade policy, achieving planned operation and eliminating blind competition. The largest market for flour nationwide is the North China region. Under the mutual consultation and research of the representatives of various regions, the representatives of the North China region voluntarily gave up a sales volume of 4.74 million bags of market capacity to accommodate the transportation and sales from other regions, in order to take care of the regions with lower flour operating rates. The specific number of sales from each region to North China was determined: East China transported out 2.138 million bags, accounting for 11.2 percent of its operating rate; Shandong in East China transported out 907,000 bags, accounting for 13.7 percent of its operating rate; Central South transported out 895,000 bags, accounting for 16.7 percent of its operating rate; and Northwest transported and sold 800,000 bags, accounting for 15.1 percent of its operating rate.
    This grain processing conference has successfully solved the problem of balancing flour production and sales, paving the way for the planned nature of production and transportation and sales, reducing and gradually achieving the elimination of the shocking waste of blind production and transportation and sales. Public and private representatives were satisfied. They unanimously expressed their determination to strive for the thorough realization of this "production and sales balance plan."

　　公私协商，平衡产销
    追记全国粮食加工会议
    本报记者  康伟中
    我国面粉工业的生产能力是庞大的，过去面粉工业从没有全部开工，也从没有根据国内面粉的消费量来制定生产计划，长期存在着盲目性。在今年三月物价平稳、虚假购买力消失后，面粉就造成了严重的暂时生产过剩现象。根据这种情况，为了解决产销平衡问题，中央贸易部召开了全国公私营面粉加工代表会议，共同在统筹兼顾的原则下，以销定产，达到全国面粉的产销平衡。这次从七月十一日到八月六日止的二十七天粮食加工会议就完满地解决了这个问题。
    我国面粉工业的生产能力究竟有多大呢？根据统计，全国（东北区未列入）共有公私营面粉厂五百九十七家（其中公营一○○家，私营四九七家），如若每日二十四小时生产四十八万五千一百六十二袋的话，每月（每月以二十二天计算）生产达一千零六十七万余袋，全年（十二个月）生产量为一亿二千八百余万袋。但全国实际的消费量还是很小的。根据去年六月起至今年五月底的统计，全国实销量约略估计仅四千八百余万袋，占全国生产能力的百分之三十七以上。
    再从上年度（去年六月至今年五月）实际生产量五千三百六十六万余袋与实销量相比较，产销不平衡的现象则更为明显。上年度各区面粉厂开工率是不平衡的。华东区实际生产量只占该区生产能力的百分之二九点八二，华东区内的山东省只占百分之三八点一三，中南区只占百分之二四点五九，西南区占百分之二五点一，西北区占百分之七十，华北区占百分之七二点八。从上述数目字来看，上年度实际生产量与实际生产能力相距甚远。而实际消费量，却更是低下。截至今年五月底统计：华北区剩余面粉二百三十五万七千余袋，中南区剩余一百七十四万余袋，华东区的山东剩余五十五万袋；华东开工率最低，故剩余仅五十五万五千袋，总计上年度剩余面粉达五百二十万余袋。
    按目前全国面粉工业生产能力与将近五亿人口的庞大的消费量来看，今天面粉的生产量仍是不足道的。但是为什么会生产过剩呢？
    这是因为我国面粉工业是在国民党匪帮长期的通货膨胀，和面粉做为投机资本家囤积居奇的对象时盲目地发展起来的。加以某些大中城市是国民党的官僚机构、寄生的逃亡地主和庞大的反动驻军集中地区，人口臃肿。在物价剧烈波动时，奸商们又兴风作浪，竞相抢购，面粉生产就建筑在这样虚假繁荣的基础上。另一方面国民党匪帮在统治时的残酷搜括，农村人民穷困，购买力低下，再加上农村习用土制面粉，城乡关系不协调等原因，使面粉的销售市场仅限在大中城市，这种现象，在解放后虽经某些调整，但尚没有纳入合理轨道。由于以上原因，面粉的销路在今年三月物价稳定，虚假购买力消失后就呈现出严重的生产过剩的现象。
    如何调整这些不合理现象，消灭盲目性，以达到面粉的产销平衡，这是目前最重要的课题。各地面粉工业的代表在会议上对“以销定产”或“以产定销”两问题展开了热烈的争论。有的代表提出今年全国小麦产量达三百八十八亿斤，估计农民本身消费、交纳公粮和留种籽外，剩余达五十八亿九千万斤。如果农民将剩余粮食保存四成，尚有六成达三十五亿三千四百万斤出售；再加上今年财政上公粮大约可供给全国全部面粉工业的开工，因此，他们希望为照顾目前面粉工业的生产困难起见，就应该“以产定销”，达到全部加工。但大多数代表则不同意全部开工。他们认为：如果今年面粉业“以产定销”的话，势必造成了比上年度更为严重的生产过剩现象。正如一位代表说：“这种生产过剩就会使生产与运销者盲目竞争，压低价格，结果公私双方将会两败俱伤，陷工厂于垮台地步。”为避免这种巨大损失，他们认为必须做到“以销定产”，达成“平衡产销，计划经营”的地步。
    最后的结论都一致集中在平衡产销的问题上。如何平衡产销呢？这又是一个繁杂的问题。
    各地代表原则上根据去年六月起至今年五月止，这一年来全国面粉销售总量作为一个基数。但另一方面，又根据了今年市场上新的情况。譬如各地人民政府已大力进行了调整公私关系，减轻了税收等原因，因此使各地经济情况已开始渐趋好转，市场上的真实购买力已逐渐表现出来。各地代表根据最近在实际的面粉经营中，估计到市场上的销售量较以前可能增加百分之十左右，故由此推算今年增至销售量五千三百三十万三千三百零三袋。此外，中粮公司在重点照顾华东区特别困难情况下，在原有计划上又多增加加工面粉七十九万七千一百五十七袋。总计今年生产数量是五千四百一十万零四百六十袋。这是本年度（今年六月至明年五月）全国面粉生产的范围。这一生产数量是确切地根据今年可能的销售额制定的生产计划，从而可以达到产销平衡，使面粉业走上计划经营的轨道。
    全国的面粉生产计划已确定。代表们又进一步根据计划数目，按照各区生产与实际消费情况，共同协商各地生产量与开工率。这又引起了一场热烈的争论。各地代表都一致强调各该区的困难，希望多予照顾。有的主张面粉加工应以原料的产区和成品的销区为对象，应是有重点的加工。但另有人提议面粉加工应按各区现有生产能力统一增减，统一分配和加工。
    但争论的结论都归结在“统筹兼顾、各得其所”这个原则上。肯定地说，中国面粉工业在将来是不会过剩的，它的存在是有前途的。
    在销售市场上，华北区面粉界的代表本着“互相照顾”的精神，首先让出该区加工面粉的一部分；西北区由于面粉销路困难也自动地让出一部分。华北区让出它现有开工率的百分之七点三；西北区让出它现有开工率的百分之十七点四。这些出让的部分再加上今年新的情况下增加的部分，就使得华东、华东区的山东、中南三地又适当增加了开工率。解决了他们生产不足的困难。如华东区由上年度开工率百分之二九点八二增至百分之三十二点六；华东区的山东省由上年度开工率的百分之三八点一三增至百分之四二点二。中南区因过去开工率最低，故这次增加量也多，上年度该区开工率百分之二十四点五九，现增至百分之三十五点五，实增百分之十一。面粉加工的分配代表们都一致表示满意。
    与面粉生产紧密联系的另一问题，是根据国家自由贸易政策，统一地制定了面粉市场的划分范围，达到了计划经营，杜绝了盲目竞销。全国面粉的最大市场是华北区。在各区代表互相协商、研究下，华北区的代表自动地让出四百七十四万袋的销售量的市场容纳外区运销，以照顾面粉开工率较低的地区。具体确定了各区向华北运销数目：计华东区运出二百一十三万八千袋，占其开工率的百分之十一点二；华东区的山东运出九十万七千袋，占其开工率的百分之十三点七；中南区运出八十九万五千袋，占其开工率的百分之十六点七；西北区运销八十万袋，占其开工率的百分之十五点一。
    这次粮食加工会议，已完满地解决了面粉的平衡产销问题，为生产与运销的计划性铺平了道路，减少并可逐渐达到消灭盲目生产和运销的惊人浪费现象。公私营代表都感到满意。一致表示要为这次“产销平衡计划”的彻底实现而奋斗。
