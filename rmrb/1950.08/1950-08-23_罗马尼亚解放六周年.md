　　Sixth Anniversary of Romania's Liberation
　　Ludenko, Ambassador of the People's Republic of Romania to China
　　Today, the working people of Romania warmly celebrate the sixth anniversary of their liberation. On August 23, 1944, the heroic Soviet army crushed the Hitlerite bandits on Romanian soil, enabling the Romanian Communist Party to lead the united patriotic forces of the whole country to overthrow the traitorous fascist rule of General Antonescu, organize domestic armed forces to drive out the Nazi invaders, and take resolute action to begin building a new, democratic Romania.

　　Six years have passed! These are six years of arduous struggle for the Romanian working class and its allies; six years of great revolutionary achievements in the thorough social reform that is underway!

　　Until August 23, 1944, the criminal, anti-people war into which the Hitlerite bandits dragged Romania brought enormous destruction to Romania. It disintegrated the national economy and subjected the masses of people to deep exploitation and extreme poverty. In addition to this, the remnants of the old forces added various kinds of suffering: such as various feudal exploitations of the peasants, oppression of other nationalities within the country, and semi-colonial exploitation by domestic tycoons controlled by foreign imperialists.

　　Those reactionary old parties that had done their best to fascisize Romania and promote Hitler's war before and during the war tried to avoid responsibility and finally superficially participated in the national salvation actions led by the Romanian Communist Party.

　　Driven by their own class interests, those parties hoped to take the opportunity to lead the Romanian people away from the alliance with the Soviet Union, thereby derailing the national democratization, maintaining their old privileges, re-enslaving the Romanian people, and serving the interests of Anglo-American imperialism.

　　With the support of Anglo-American imperialists and their running dogs, the Romanian king, and the royal family group, those reactionary parties seized a majority of seats in the initial governments after August 23, 1944, retained old officials and pro-Nazi cadres, and absorbed disbanded fascist party members, thus actually sabotaging the beginning of all domestic construction work. On March 6, 1945, thanks to the massive mass actions organized by the Romanian Communist Party and the sacrifices of the most outstanding sons of the people, the last government with a majority of reactionaries was finally overthrown, and the government led by Dr. P. Groza took over the leadership of the country. Representatives of the working class occupied a majority of seats in the government, thus being able to begin a series of reforms on the road of people's democracy and achieve great accomplishments. On December 30, 1947, new, well-prepared actions eliminated the last feudal remnants of the old era and the main pillar of Anglo-American imperialism in Romania - the Romanian dynasty. In this way, the Romanian working class, under the unified leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and with the support of its ally, the working peasantry, grasped all the state power of the People's Republic of Romania and began to build the foundations of socialism.

　　Taking the precious experience of the Soviet Union as an example, it is impossible to build a new socialist society without a strong industrial foundation. The Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the government of the People's Republic of Romania nationalized the main sectors of industrial production and placed banks, transportation, and social insurance undertakings under state management, replaced reactionary officials in the government, and established various provisional committees. Since 1949, the country has entered the stage of planned economy, first with a one-year plan, followed by another one-year plan in 1950. The 1949 national plan showed a production increase of 40% over the 1948 level. Due to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, the original plan was overfulfilled, with a total achievement of 108% of the original plan. The 1950 plan also showed that the value of industrial production increased by 37% compared to 1949. The funds used for investment in 1950 reached 145 billion lei (Romanian currency, with 160 lei equivalent to approximately one US dollar), exceeding the 1949 investment amount by 50%. Of the total investment, 55.4% was designated for heavy industry and the construction industry. The number of industrial workers will also increase by 130,000.

　　Romanian industry produces machines and machine parts, such as tractors, lathes, and steel balls. These things previously had to be imported from foreign countries, and some had never even existed domestically, such as combine harvesters.

　　The experience and achievements gained in the first year of the plan have made it possible to specifically prepare the first five-year plan this year. The main characteristics of this five-year plan are: a large increase in the production of heavy industry and oil refining industry, the establishment of an industrial base for manufacturing heavy machine tools domestically, electrification of the entire country, increased production of new agricultural tools and machinery, reduction of labor intensity for working peasants during working hours, and enabling the socialist transformation of agriculture to obtain the necessary material foundation. The output of tractors will reach 6,000 units per year, so by the end of 1955, when the five-year plan is completed, we will have 25,000 tractors, enough to meet the needs of agricultural mechanization in the whole country. By that time, the area for planting grains will increase by 2% compared to 1949, the area for planting rice will increase by 34.8%, the area for planting cotton will increase by half, and the area for planting sugar beets will increase by 6%. The number of livestock and poultry will also increase significantly, the number of machinery stations and tractor stations will increase by 34%, and the number of tractor drivers will increase by 207%. The collectivization of peasant industries will be further encouraged, and the number of collective farms in the country is already nearly 700.

　　According to the initially determined terms, in the last year of the five-year plan, pig iron production will reach 1 million tons, steel production will reach 1.25 million tons, coal production will reach 8 million tons, and electricity supply will reach 2 million kilowatts. The achievements of the People's Democratic regime in five years will be three and a half times the achievements of the landlord-capitalist regime in sixty years, and the achievement of national electrification is one example. By the end of the five-year plan, the national gross income will double.（⑴⑷）

　　The imperialists of Europe and the Americas, and the special agents they employ, are unwilling to see these achievements in Romania's economic construction. They have used all "insidious" methods to try to hinder or defeat the construction of the new Romania, which is being carried out in the big family of people's democratic countries, in cooperation with the Soviet Union and with the Soviet Union's crucial assistance. In their wicked and desperate struggle to restore their political influence and rights, they have organized terrorist fascist groups, carried out espionage and sabotage work, and prepared to carry out terrorist actions, assassinating patriotic people and communists. All these conspiracies have been exposed to the people in several historical treason trials, such as the Maniu, Pop, and Bujor cases. In all these acts of conspiracy and harm, the vigilance of the people has exposed their masks and taken appropriate countermeasures.

　　In the task of building a new life and defending the victories already won, the working class of the People's Republic of Romania has demonstrated its ardent patriotism in action, as well as its ability to work and struggle under the leadership of the Workers' Party. The active promotion of socialist production competition in the country is a powerful proof of the working masses' enthusiastic support for the People's Democratic regime. In factories and institutions, they are mobilized to fight for the progress of the country. The mass initiative, innovation in production methods, and rationalization of working methods are important factors in gradually completing production plans. The laboring masses know that their destiny is in their own hands, that they are working for themselves, and that they defend peace because they need peace. As G. Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, said: "This is the result of the strengthening of the socialist consciousness of our laboring masses. It is also a firm answer they give to the Anglo-American warmongers."

　　Thanks to the work and struggle of the laboring masses under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, and the continuous and massive assistance of the great Soviet Union in all aspects - from economy and technology to politics and culture - the young People's Republic of Romania is prospering day by day, and the lives of the laboring people are becoming better and richer. Since the first year of the establishment of the People's Republic in 1948, the state's fiscal revenue has exceeded expenditure, which has never been heard of in the financial history of any previous regime.

　　The majority of the revenue on the budget of the People's Republic of Romania comes from the fruits of production, not from the income of the people as in the past, a situation that still exists in those countries where the masses have no right to interfere in state affairs, and Romania's national income in 1950 will increase by 25% compared to 1949. After the state's industry and natural resources became the property of the people, they are now used to strive for the improvement of the cultural and material life of the laboring people in urban and rural areas. Workers' salaries have increased, the number of workers has increased, plus the social insurance system established for diseases, paid holidays, free general education and higher education, free health and medical equipment, nurseries, day care centers, public canteens and other facilities. By the time the five-year plan is completed, the living standards of the laboring people will increase by 80% compared to 1949.

　　When there are achievements in economic and social struggles, the Romanian Workers' Party and the government have played a great leading role in transforming the vast masses and educating their thoughts in the spirit of socialism.

　　Millions of copies of daily newspapers are published, and countless volumes of Marxist classics are provided for the masses to read. Countless lectures are held in the country to spread the great ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. New schools have been opened, new scientific and cultural institutions have been established, and various academic scholarships encourage scientific, literary, and artistic activities to serve the people and oppose foolish imperialist conspiracies based on superstition and mysticism.

　　Some of the most valuable people in the Romanian intelligentsia have resolutely participated in the work of building a new socialist Romania, and new members with the highest scientific knowledge - the science of Marxism-Leninism - are being produced in large numbers from the working class and the laboring peasantry.

　　Today, on the sixth anniversary of liberation, all the laboring people of Romania have united and increased their strength tenfold to expand their achievements and resist any domestic and foreign reactionary disturbances. The Romanian people are fighting for peace and are actually engaged in this battle. The fact that Romania has signed a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the leader of the socialist peace camp, the great Soviet Union, is a matter of great pride for the Romanian people.

　　The basis of the diplomatic policy of the People's Republic of Romania lies in the unhesitating desire of the Romanian people to maintain deep friendship with its liberator and eternal friend, the great Soviet Union. This point has been clearly stated by A. Pauker, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Romania and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party: "A nation cannot obtain freedom without being friends with the Soviet Union." Adhering to this policy of peace and cooperation, the Romanian government has signed treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with other people's democratic countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. In addition, the People's Republic of Romania has established friendly relations with the equally spirited People's Republic of Albania, the heroic Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Following the historic victory of the Chinese people's resistance to imperialism and its running dogs, Romania established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The development of friendly cooperation between the great Chinese people and the Romanian people, the strengthening of the unity of these two friendly countries, and the consolidation of the democratic peace camp headed by the invincible Soviet Union, make great contributions.

　　Standing in this camp, the Romanian people, following the example of the great liberator and supporter, the Soviet Union, and together with the friendly people's democratic countries and the great People's Republic of China, as well as the laboring people all over the world who are heroically fighting for peace, democracy and progress, on this sixth anniversary of liberation, review the achievements they have made in struggle and work, and solemnly dedicate themselves to new efforts and new progress to defend peace and democracy, and build socialism. There is no doubt that on this road, with the help of the great Soviet Union led by the Romanian people's best friend, Marshal Stalin, the Romanian people will move forward.

　　罗马尼亚解放六周年
    罗马尼亚人民共和国驻华大使  鲁登科
    今天，罗马尼亚的劳动人民要热烈庆祝解放第六周年纪念日。一九四四年八月二十三日，英勇的苏联军队把罗马尼亚土地上的希特勒匪帮击溃了，使罗马尼亚共产党能够领导全国统一的爱国力量来推翻卖国的安托纳斯古将军的法西斯统治，并组织国内武装力量把纳粹侵略者驱逐出去，同时又以坚决的行动开始建立新的民主的罗马尼亚。
    六年过去了！这是罗马尼亚工人阶级及其同盟者坚苦斗争的六年；这是在进行着的彻底的社会改革有伟大的革命成就的六年！
    直到一九四四年八月二十三日为止，希特勒匪帮驱使罗马尼亚卷入的那一种罪恶的、反人民的战争给罗马尼亚带来了巨大的破坏，它使国民经济解体，使人民大众受到深烈的剥削而至极端贫困；除此以外，往昔的残余势力又给添上了种种苦难：如对农民的各种封建剥削，对国内其他民族的压迫，在外国帝国主义者控制下的本国豪门的半殖民地式的剥削等。
    在大战以前及大战期间曾经尽力于罗马尼亚法西斯化及希特勒的战争的那些反动的老党派，竭力想避免责任，最后就在表面上参加了罗马尼亚共产党所领导的救国行动。
    由于本身的阶级利益的推动，那些党派希望乘机使罗马尼亚人民离开了与苏联同盟从而使全国民主化的道路，保持他们旧有的特权，重新奴役罗马尼亚人民，来服从英美帝国主义的利益。
    在英美帝国主义者和他们的走狗，罗马尼亚的国王和皇室集团的支持之下，那些反动党派在一九四四年八月二十三日以后的初期的政府中攫得了多数的席位，留用了旧官员和亲纳粹的干部，并吸收了被解散的法西斯党员，这样，实际上在一切国内建设工作的开端就怠了工。一九四五年三月六日，由于罗马尼亚共产党所组织的巨大的群众行动和人民的最优秀的儿子们的流血牺牲，最后一个拥有多数反动派的政府终于被推翻了，于是Ｐ·格罗查博士所领导的政府取得了国家领导权。工人阶级代表占了政府中多数的席位，因而能够在人民民主的道路上开始一连串的改革，并得到伟大的成就。一九四七年十二月三十日，又以准备成熟的新行动铲除了旧时代的最后封建残余和英美帝国主义在罗马尼亚的主要支柱——罗马尼亚的王朝。这样，罗马尼亚的工人阶级在罗马尼亚工人党的统一领导，和同盟者劳动农民的支持下，掌握了罗马尼亚人民共和国的全部国家政权，开始建设社会主义的基础。
    以苏联的宝贵经验为例，如果没有强大的工业化基础，要建立新的社会主义社会是不可能的。罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会和罗马尼亚人民共和国政府将工业生产的主要部门国有化，并将银行、运输和社会保险事业都归国家经营，撤换政府里的反动官员，成立各种临时委员会。自一九四九年开始，全国进入了计划经济的阶段，先是一个一年计划，接着在一九五○年又是一个一年计划。一九四九年的国家计划表明了生产量超出一九四八年水平百分之四十。由于群众的革命热忱，原定计划是超额完成的，总成绩是原计划百分之一○八。一九五○年的计划也表明了工业生产的价值和一九四九年的比较起来，增加了百分之三十七。用作一九五○年投资的款项达一千四百五十亿雷伊（罗马尼亚币名，每一百六十雷伊约合一元美金），超出一九四九年投资数量百分之五十。在全部投资中，百分之五十五点四，被指定作重工业和建筑工业的用途。产业工人的数量也将新增十三万人。
    罗马尼亚工业出产机器和机器零件，如拖拉机、车床、钢珠等。这些东西以前都须从外国输入，也有甚至在国内从未有过的，如联合收获机之类。
    第一年计划所获得的经验和成就，使今年得以具体地准备第一个五年计划。这五年计划的主要特点是：重工业和炼油工业大量增产，制造重工作母机的工业基础在国内建立起来，使全国电气化，提高新农具和机械的生产，使劳动农民在工作时间能减轻劳力，并使农业的社会主义的转变能够得到必需的物质基础。其中拖拉机的产量将达每年六千辆，所以到一九五五年底，五年计划完成时，我们将有二万五千辆拖拉机，足敷全国农业机械化之用。到那时候种植谷类的区域和一九四九年相比，将增加百分之二，种米区域将增加百分之三十四点八，种棉区域将增加一半，种甜菜根区域将增加百分之六。牲畜和家禽的数目也将大量增加，机械站和拖拉机站将增加百分之三十四，拖拉机的驾驶员将增加百分之二百零七。农民产业的集体化将受到进一步的鼓励，目前国内集体农场的数量已经将近七百个了。
    按照最初所定的条项，在五年计划的最后一年，生铁产量将达一百万吨，钢的产量将达一百二十五万吨，煤的产量将达八百万吨，电力供应将达二百万千瓦。在人民民主政权五年内的成就将为地主资本家政权在六十年内所达到的成就的三倍半，全国电气化的成就就是一个例子。到五年计划终了，全国国民总收入将增加一倍。（⑴⑷）
    欧洲和美洲的帝国主义者，和他们所雇用的特务是不愿看到罗马尼亚经济建设上这些成就的。用了一切“阴险的”方法他们企图阻碍或是挫败新罗马尼亚的生活建设，这种建设是在人民民主国家的大家庭中间，在与苏联的合作以及苏联的切要的援助之下进行着的。在他们企图恢复自己的政治势力和权利的罪恶的绝望挣扎中，他们组织了恐怖性的法西斯团体，进行间谍和破坏工作，准备着实行恐怖行动，谋杀爱国志士和共产党员。所有这些阴谋都在历来的几次叛国案审判中，暴露在人民的眼前，如马纽、鲍浦、布乔等案子就是在所有这些谋叛和危害的行动中，人民的警觉性揭破了他们的假面具，采取了适当的应付手段。
    在建设新生活及保卫已获得的胜利的任务中，罗马尼亚人民共和国的工人阶级曾以行动证明了他们热烈的爱国心，以及他们在工人党领导下的工作能力和斗争。国内社会主义生产竞赛的积极推进，是工人群众热心拥护人民民主政权的有力证明。在工厂和机关中，他们动员起来，为国家的进步而斗争。群众的主动创造力、生产方式的革新及工作方法的合理化，在逐步完成生产计划中是重要的因素。劳动大众知道自己的命运操在自己手里，他们是替自己工作，他们保卫和平因为他们需要和平。正如罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记Ｇ·德治所说：“这是我们劳动大众的社会主义意识加强的结果。这也是他们给予英美战争贩子的一个坚决的回答。”
    由于罗马尼亚工人党领导下的劳动大众的工作和斗争，以及伟大的苏联在各方面——自经济，技术，以至于政治，文化——的不断的大量帮助，年青的罗马尼亚人民共和国一天天繁荣起来，劳动人民的生活变得愈美好愈丰富了。自一九四八年人民共和国成立的第一年开始，国家财政的收入比开支多，这是在过去任何政权下的财政史上从未听见过的事。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的预算表上的收入大部分得自生产的果实，而非像过去一样得自人民的收入，这种情形目前在群众无权过问国事的那些国家里还是存在着，而罗马尼亚的国家收入在一九五○年将较一九四九年增加百分之二十五。国家的工业和天然资源成了人民的财产之后，现在已用以争取城乡劳动人民的文化和物质生活的改善了。工人的薪金增加了，工人数目增加了，再加上为疾病而设立的社会保险制度，有工资的假期、免费的普通教育和高等教育、免费的卫生医药设备、育婴所、白日托儿所、公共食堂等设施。到五年计划完成的时候，劳动人民的生活水准将比一九四九年提高百分之八十。
    在经济和社会方面的斗争有了成就的时候，罗马尼亚工人党和政府在改造广大群众及以社会主义的精神教育他们的思想斗争中，起了很大的领导作用。
    每日的报纸数以百万份计地发行着，无数册的马克斯主义经典著作供给着群众阅读。国内举行着无数次演讲会来传播马恩列斯的伟大思想。新的学校开设了，新的科学和文化机构创立起来了，有各类的学术奖金鼓励科学，文学和艺术的活动为人民服务，并反对基于迷信和神秘主义的，愚妄的帝国主义的阴谋诡计。
    罗马尼亚知识分子中最可贵的一些人已坚决地参加了建设社会主义的新罗马尼亚的工作，还有拥有最高科学知识——马列主义的科学——的新分子，正从工人阶级和劳动农民中间大量产生出来。
    在今天，解放六周年，罗马尼亚全部劳动人民已经团结起来，并且增加了十倍力量来扩大既得的成就，抵抗任何国内外的反动骚扰。罗马尼亚人民要为和平而斗争，在实际上已处身于这个战斗中。罗马尼亚已和社会主义和平阵营的领导者，伟大的苏联，订立了友好、合作、互助条约，这一事实，在罗马尼亚人民是感到极其光荣的。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的外交政策的基础上有着罗马尼亚人民的毫不踌躇的愿望，就是要和它的解放者和永久的友人，伟大的苏联保持深切的友谊。这一点，罗马尼亚人民共和国外交部长，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记Ａ·鲍克已经清楚地说出：“如果不和苏联做朋友，一个民族是不可能得到自由的。”坚守着这和平和合作的政策，罗马尼亚政府已和其他人民民主国家如保加利亚、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰等，订立了友好、合作、互助的条约。此外，罗马尼亚人民共和国又以同样的精神和勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，英雄的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，蒙古人民共和国，越南民主共和国等，建立了友好的关系。紧接着中国人民反抗帝国主义及其走狗获得历史性的胜利之后，罗马尼亚又和中华人民共和国建立了外交关系。在伟大的中国人民和罗马尼亚人民之间的友好合作的发展，在这两个友好国家的团结的加强上，在以不可克服的苏联为首的民主和平阵营的巩固上，都有极大的贡献。
    处在这个阵营中间的罗马尼亚人民依照着伟大的解放者和支持者苏联的例子，和各友好的人民民主国家和伟大的中华人民共和国，以及全世界为和平、民主和进步而英雄地斗争着的劳动人民在一起，在这解放六周年的日子，检讨本身在斗争和工作中所获得的种种成就的时候，庄严地献身于新的努力和新的进步来保卫和平民主，并建设社会主义。毫无疑问，在这条路上，凭着罗马尼亚人民最好的朋友斯大林大元帅所领导的伟大苏联的帮助，罗马尼亚人民是要踏步前进的。（李秋德  译）
