　　The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently received a letter from the International Women's Federation to its member groups, pointing out the following shortcomings in the current work of member groups in carrying out the peace movement: (1) The work of some countries' peace organizations and women's groups among workers, peasants, and the middle class in cities is not deep enough, so that the peace movement has not reached a certain breadth; (2) Member groups have not made enough efforts to get other women's groups and prominent social figures to actively participate in this movement, and still show some degree of narrowness; (3) The peace movement in some member countries is reduced to formal signature collection, and widespread education work is not done enough.

　　In order to achieve the noble goal of defending peace, the Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation made the following proposals to its member groups:

　　(1) Strengthen work conducive to peace in various ways;
　　(2) All members of the Women's International Democratic Federation should sign the Peace Declaration, and try to get working women, peasant women, and middle-class women in cities to sign;
　　(3) Each member should use personal strength and relationships to absorb prominent women leaders or outstanding women from other countries to sign, and especially urge leaders of women's groups to actively support it;
　　(4) Democratic women should be absorbed into the committees for defending peace;
　　(5) All methods should be used to initiate signatures. Member groups should play an organizational and leading role, and improve their working methods;
　　(6) Conduct in-depth publicity, using the most effective methods and activities, such as door-to-door solicitation and publicity in public gathering places such as apartments, markets, parks, schools, and theaters. Print and distribute various printed materials to call on women to sign;
　　(7) Women from various countries should exchange letters and experiences to enhance friendship and unity among women from various countries.

　　Finally, the Secretariat suggested that member groups carry out the following work before the Second World Peace Congress to be held this autumn:

　　(1) Immediately publicize the Second World Peace Congress to all women;
　　(2) Through various women's gatherings, solicit their proposals and opinions on the Peace Congress, and convey these opinions to the Second World Peace Congress and notify the Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation.

　　Through our efforts, let us defeat war with peace!

　　国际妇联号召各会员团体
    继续加强各国和平签名运动
    并广泛征集妇女对第二届和大的建议
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会日前收到国际妇联给各会员团体的来信，信中指出目前各会员团体在开展和平运动的工作中还存在着如下的缺点：（一）有些国家的保卫和平组织和妇女团体在工人、农民和城市中的中等阶层的工作中还不够深入，以致使保卫和平的运动未能进到一定的宽度；（二）各会员团体还没有尽足够的努力使其他妇女团体和社会有名人士来积极参加这一运动，还表现着某种程度的狭隘性；（三）某些会员国家的和平运动流于形式的征集签名，广泛的教育工作做得不够。
    为了达到保卫和平的崇高目标，国际民主妇联书记处向各会员团体作如下的提议：
    （一）要用各种方法来加强有利和平的工作；
    （二）国际民主妇联全体会员在和平宣言上签名，尽量争取劳动妇女、农妇及城市中间阶层的妇女签名；
    （三）各会员用个人力量与个人关系吸收著名妇女领袖或别国杰出的妇女们来签名，特别要敦促妇女团体的领袖们积极支持；
    （四）应在保卫和平的委员会中，吸收民主妇女参加；
    （五）要用一切方法发起签名，会员团体应起组织作用，带头作用，并改善自己的工作方法；
    （六）深入宣传，运用最有效的方法和活动，如挨户征集、和在公寓、市集、公园、学校、戏院等公共集合处进行宣传。印发各种印刷品，号召妇女签名；
    （七）各国妇女交换信件与经验，以增强各国妇女间的友谊与团结。
    最后，书记处建议各会员团体，在今秋即将举行的第二届世界和平大会开会之前，进行以下工作：
    （一）立即向所有的妇女们宣传第二届世界和平大会；
    （二）通过各种妇女集会，征集她们对和平大会的提案和意见，并将这些意见转达给第二届世界和平大会并通知国际民主妇联书记处。
    通过我们的努力，用和平来战胜战争！
