　　China New Democratic Youth League Central Committee
    Decision on Strengthening the League's Propaganda and Education Work
    —August 3, 1950
    I. The Youth League currently has over 2.5 million members, and League organizations have been established in various regions across the country. The League has played a significant positive role in various tasks. However, the systematic education in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought conducted among League members is insufficient. To improve the political and ideological level of general League members, especially cadres, and to further develop the League's role, the Central Committee of the Youth League believes that strengthening propaganda and education work within the League is a crucial aspect of the current Youth League work.
    II. League committees at all levels must earnestly strengthen the leadership and research of propaganda and education work. They should improve the structure of propaganda departments. For League committee propaganda departments above the county level, appropriate cadres should be assigned, and efforts should be gradually made to ensure that League district committees can assign a propaganda committee member with an appropriate political and cultural level. Propaganda departments should establish regular business and work systems, and formulate propaganda and education work plans for a certain period. These plans must be feasible based on the actual living conditions of League members. Education should be provided to League members, but without taking up too much of their time, which would hinder their production and regular learning, as has happened in some places. Special attention should be paid to training a large number of League cadres, including those working in propaganda and education. League schools or cadre training classes above the prefectural committee level should focus on training propaganda work cadres. When necessary and possible, propaganda and education work training classes can be established. League committees at all levels must strengthen the leadership of the educational work in the current League schools, short-term training classes, and the learning of cadres in their positions. Only in this way can the propaganda and education work of the entire League be strengthened and carried out regularly and systematically.
    III. In order to systematically conduct League member education, in addition to inspecting the various educational methods currently being carried out in various places, removing all unsuitable ones, retaining the most needed ones and enriching their content, consideration can be given to implementing a system of regular League classes in various regions, especially in old liberated areas and cities. These League classes can be held by branches or a combination of several branches, but the frequency must not be too high (in rural areas, it can be once every month or even two months). Each lesson's content must be well-prepared according to the level of the League members. It must be ensured that each lesson truly increases the League members' knowledge and makes them willing to attend. Strict prevention of becoming a formality is necessary. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the League is responsible for compiling or designating several applicable textbooks for various regions to use as basic reference materials for classes. League committees at all levels must establish propagandists under possible conditions, who can conduct League classes. In addition to explaining important current events and the central work of the Party and the League, the League classes should systematically teach the basic knowledge of the League (i.e., education on the League Constitution and Regulations) and the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The propagandists of urban Leagues should be led by the Propaganda Department of the League Municipal Committee, and more cadres or League members with a certain political and cultural level who are not separated from production should be used as part-time propagandists. A certain number of full-time propagandists can be established in larger cities. In rural areas, the method of "teaching stations" should be promoted, and primary school teachers, village cadres, etc. should be invited to serve as propagandists (i.e., lecturers and branch instructors at teaching stations). League prefectural committees should systematically train and educate these propagandists. Full-time propagandists established above the provincial committee level (quotas can be allocated from the League school's establishment), in addition to conducting lectures in branches to gain experience, should assist League committees below the county level in training and educating part-time propagandists. Regarding the method of propagandists, the "Provisional Outline of Propaganda Work" issued by the Central Committee of the League can be used as a reference for various regions. League committees in various regions must gradually implement it step by step and with emphasis according to local conditions.
    IV. The cultural and technical learning of League members should be earnestly developed. Cadres and League members with low cultural levels should be guided to participate in cultural learning. League members in factories should actively participate in workers' spare-time cultural supplementary schools and technical schools, and League members in rural areas should actively participate in people's schools or night schools, and promote the learning of young people with their own exemplary behavior in learning.
    V. In the current situation where there is a great shortage of teaching materials for League member education and cadre education in factories and rural areas, League committees in various regions should use League journals to solve part of the teaching material problem. Except in special circumstances, in general, League journals in each province should focus on rural youth, and League journals in each city should focus on factory youth. All local League journals should strive to be localized, popularized, and combined with actual conditions. League committees above the provincial and municipal levels should compile a large number of teaching materials and various reading materials for League members in factories and rural areas based on the documents of the Central Committee of the League and in conjunction with local conditions. These teaching materials must be reviewed and approved by the regional League committee if they are distributed to various places. Those involving national issues must be reviewed and approved by the Central Committee of the League.
    VI. In order to expand the propaganda of the Youth League and exchange the experience of youth work, League committees at all levels must strengthen communication and reporting work. The activities of the Youth League should be reported to the people of the country through "China Youth," People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, People's Broadcasting Station, and local newspapers. League committees above the provincial and municipal levels should write a paper or communication every three months on solving the practical problems of youth and the Youth League. The content of communication reports is the role of the League in the various tasks called for by the Party and the government. League committees at all levels should attach importance to communication and reporting work. Young workers' and peasants' correspondents should be cultivated by use of the local League journals.
    VII. The Central Committee of the League will convene a national propaganda work conference of the Youth League in October to summarize and study the propaganda and education work during this period (another notification will be given). After receiving this decision, League committees in various regions should summarize the propaganda and education work and formulate a plan. This work must be basically rectified and established before the national propaganda work conference. League committees in various regions must report the situation of implementing this decision to the Central Committee of the League.

　　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    关于加强团的宣传教育工作的决定
    ——一九五零年八月三日
    一、目前青年团已有二百五十万以上的团员，在全国各个地区都已建立了团的组织。团在各个工作中起了很大的积极作用。但在团员中所进行的有系统的马列主义、毛泽东思想的教育是很不够的。为了提高一般团员特别是干部的政治思想水平，使团的作用得到进一步的发展，青年团中央认为加强团内的宣传教育工作，乃是当前青年团工作的一个重要环节。
    二、各级团委必须认真地加强宣传教育工作的领导与研究，应该健全宣传部门的机构，对于县委以上团委宣传部门，要配备给恰当的干部，并要逐渐做到团的区委能够配备一个具有适当政治文化水平的宣传委员。宣传部门应建立起经常的业务和工作制度，拟定一定时期的宣传教育工作计划，这种计划必须是根据团员生活的实际情况而可以行得通的计划。对团员要进行教育，但又不要占去团员很多时间以致妨碍他们的生产和经常学习，如同有些地方已经发生的那样。特别注意大量训练团的干部，包括宣传教育工作的干部。地委以上团委的团校或干部训练班中，应注意培养宣传工作干部，必要和可能时，可设立宣传教育工作训练班。对于目前各级团校，各个短期训练班的教育工作，以及在职干部的学习，各级团委须加强领导。只有这样，才能够加强全团的宣传教育工作，并使这一工作得以经常地有计划地进行。
    三、为了系统地进行团员教育，除对目前各地进行的各种教育方式加以检查，去掉一切不适用的，保留最合需要的并充实其内容外，可以考虑在各个地区，特别在老解放区和城市中实行一种定期上团课的制度。这种团课可由支部或几个支部合并举行，但绝不能次数太多（在农村里，可以是每一个月甚至两个月一次）。而每次上课内容又必须是按团员水平而有充分准备的。确实保证每上一次课真正能够增加团员一定的知识，而使团员乐于来听课。严格防止流为形式。责成团中央宣传部编写或指定几种适用的教材，以供各地作为上课的基本参考材料。各级团委在可能条件下须设宣传员，可由他们进行讲授团课。所授团课，除重要时事及党和团的中心工作，须加讲解外，应有计划地讲授团的基本知识（即团纲团章教育）和马列主义、毛泽东思想的基本知识。城市团的宣传员，应由团市委宣传部领导，须多利用不脱离生产而有一定政治文化水平的干部或团员作兼职宣传员。在较大的城市中可设立一定数量的专职宣传员。农村中则应推广“传授站”的办法，请小学教员、村干部等担任宣传员（即传授站讲课人员与支部教员），团的地委应有计划地进行对这种宣传员的训练和教育。省委以上所设的专职宣传员（可从团校编制中拨出名额），除到支部中进行讲授，以吸取经验外，应帮助县以下团委对兼职宣传员进行训练和教育的工作。关于宣传员的办法，团中央发布的“宣传员工作暂行纲要”，可供各地参考。各地团委须按当地情形，有步骤地有重点地逐渐推行。
    四、应认真开展团员的文化技术学习。要引导文化水平低的干部和团员，参加文化学习。工厂中的团员应积极参加工人业余文化补习学校和技术学校，农村中的团员应积极参加民校或夜校，并以自己学习上的模范行为，推动青年群众的学习。
    五、在目前工厂、农村中进行团员教育与干部教育的教材甚为缺少的情况下，各地团委应利用团刊以解决一部分教材问题。除特殊情况外，一般地各省团刊应以农村青年为主要对象，各市团刊应以工厂青年为主要对象。所有地方团刊，均应力求地方化、通俗化，结合实际情况。省、市以上的团委应根据团中央文件，结合当地情况，编写大量工厂、农村团员的教材和各种读物。这些教材如发行各地，须由区域团委审查批准。涉及全国性问题者，须经团中央审查批准。
    六、为了扩大青年团的宣传，交流青年工作的经验，各级团委要加强通讯报道工作。要通过《中国青年》、人民日报、新华通讯社、人民广播电台、各地报纸等，向全国人民报导青年团的活动。省、市以上团委，每三月应写解决青年与青年团的实际问题的论文或通讯一篇。通讯报道的稿件的内容为团在党、政所号召的各项工作中的作用。各级团委均应重视通讯报道工作。并应利用地方团刊培养青年工农通讯员。
    七、团中央将在十月里召开青年团全国宣传工作会议，总结与研究这一时期的宣传教育工作（另有通知）。各地团委在接到本决定后，应将宣传教育工作加以总结，并拟定计划。须在全国宣传工作会议前基本上将这一工作整顿和建立起来。各地团委须将执行本决定情形，向团中央汇报。
