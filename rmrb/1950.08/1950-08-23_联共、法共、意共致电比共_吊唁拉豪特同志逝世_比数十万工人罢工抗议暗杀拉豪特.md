    吊唁拉豪特同志逝世
    比数十万工人罢工抗议暗杀拉豪特
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会电唁比利时共产党中央委员会，电文如下：
    惊闻比利时共产党主席和比利时工人阶级忠实的儿子朱利恩·拉豪特同志竟遭帝国主义的法西斯走狗之毒手，苏联共产党中央委员会特向比利时共产党表示其对朱利恩·拉豪特同志逝世的衷心哀悼。
    我们确信比利时共产党一定会更加紧密其行列，提高其警惕，为反对帝国主义反动，为和平与民主事业，为比利时的民族独立而进行绝不妥协的斗争。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社二十一日讯：法国共产党中央委员会致电比利时共产党，对于比共主席拉豪特惨遭暗杀一事表示吊唁与抗议，电文宣称：“法国一切劳动人民，一切和平保卫者们，都和你们同声悲恸。他们当更进一步加强他们对帝国主义凶手们的阴谋诡计的警惕性，更进一步巩固和平与民主的阵营，来回答这种令人痛恨的罪行。”
    托里亚蒂代表意大利共产党中央委员会致电比利时共产党，对于拉豪特被人恶毒暗杀一事表示非常愤慨。
    【新华社二十二日讯】综合塔斯社二十一日消息：比利时劳动人民对他们的领袖——比利时共产党主席拉豪特的受害深感哀痛。
    电讯报列日记者报道：男男女女和青年们在拉豪特灵衬旁排成一条无尽头的行列。比利时共产党中央委员会委员们由中央委员会总书记拉尔曼率领已抵达列日。
    窝伦尼亚地区有十万多工人在继续罢工，抗议杀害比利时工人阶级的领袖。沙勒罗城的所有企业中，好几万工人都已于十九日罢工。沙勒罗煤矿区的各工业、企业和矿厂，有十万多人罢工。列日地方的所有企业都已停顿。
    比共中央委员会发出告全国工人书称：拉豪特的遭受杀害，是比利时保皇分子所干的勾当。“刺客是受到那些想摧毁共产党的人们的鼓舞的，这样，他们就会容易地把比利时推上战争的道路。”
    该书结语称：“各种政治信仰的工人们！解除刺客的武装，坚决与法西斯主义作斗争，保持民主与自由！”
