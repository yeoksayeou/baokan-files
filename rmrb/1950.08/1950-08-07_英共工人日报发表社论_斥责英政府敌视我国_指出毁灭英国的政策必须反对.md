Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th. The London "Workers' Daily" published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "Morality and China," denouncing the British government's recent series of hostile actions towards China, stating:

We hope that all honest working men and women will demand an explanation for the support given by the British representative on the Security Council to the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Last Sunday, Mr. Attlee told the British people that he upholds "freedom, democracy, justice, and the supremacy of the moral law." Does the "supremacy of the moral law" require that a group of people who do not control an inch of Chinese mainland should be supported by the British representative on the Security Council, as if they were the true and legitimate government of China? The British government has long since withdrawn its recognition of the Chiang Kai-shek pseudo-"government." However, its representative supported the suggestion that this defeated and discredited group should continue to represent China at the United Nations.

The fact is that, under American pressure, the British government is beginning to change its recent policy towards China. It is being dragged into supporting the hostile actions that the United States is organizing against the People's Republic of China.

When the United States announced that it would prevent the People's Republic of China from liberating Chinese territory Taiwan, even Mr. Attlee dared not condone this act of aggression. But now, British Commonwealth Relations Secretary Walker told reporters in Sydney: once a conflict occurs between the United States and the People's Republic of China, the British government will accept the opinion of the majority in the United Nations (note: Walker made the above statement at a press conference in Sydney on the 1st). In other words, if the United States and its debtor nations and vassals declare that it is right for the Americans to prevent the Chinese government from recovering Chinese territory Taiwan, the British government will support the United States in the war. It is not surprising that the British arms program has expanded to such a massive extent. Wherever the United States engages in aggression in Asia, Britain must contribute money and lives. This kind of "morality" is not to defend Britain, but to destroy Britain. Honest men and women within the Labour Party must immediately join the struggle to force the British government to change this policy of destroying and selling out the country.

　　英共工人日报发表社论
    斥责英政府敌视我国
    指出毁灭英国的政策必须反对
    【新华社布拉格六日电】伦敦工人日报三日以“道义与中国”为题发表社论，斥责英国政府最近对中国采取的一连串敌视行动称：
    我们希望一切正直的劳动男女都要求对安理会英国代表给予蒋介石集团的代表的支持加以解释。上星期日，艾德礼先生告诉英国人民说，他维护“自由、民主、正义与道德律的至高无上”，难道“道德律的至高无上”要求一群并不控制中国大陆一寸土地的人们应该受到安理会英国代表的支持，好像他们是中国的真正合法的政府吗？英国政府早已撤销了对蒋介石伪“政府”的承认。但是，它的代表却支持这一被击败了的、无人信任的集团应当继续代表中国出席联合国的建议。
    事实是：英国政府在美国的压力下正在开始改变其最近对中国的政策。它正被拖入支持美国正在组织的反对中华人民共和国的敌对行动。
    当美国宣布要阻止中华人民共和国解放中国国土台湾时，连艾德礼先生也不敢原谅这一侵略行动，但现在英国联邦关系大臣瓦尔克却在悉尼告诉记者们：一旦美国与中华人民共和国之间发生冲突，英政府将接受联合国中多数的意见（按瓦尔克系于一日在悉尼记者招待会上发表上项言论）。换句话说：如果美国及其债务国和附庸国宣称美国人阻止中国政府收复中国领土台湾是对的，英政府即将在战争中支援美国。英国军备计划扩展到这样庞大的程度，是不足为奇的。在亚洲任何地方，美国从事侵略时，英国都要出钱出人命。这种“道义”不是要保卫英国而是要毁灭英国。工党党内正直的男女，必须立即参加迫使英国政府改变这种毁灭国家、出卖国家的政策的斗争。
