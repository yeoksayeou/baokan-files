To the Editor:

We are cadres from the Health Section of the Liaocheng Prefectural Office in Pingyuan Province. We are now reporting to you an incident in which the lives of the people have been severely harmed due to the bureaucracy of the district government. We hope you will publish it in the newspaper to alert governments in various regions.

In Qijizhen (where the district government is located) in the Fourth District of Yanggu County, Liaocheng Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, a bacterial dysentery epidemic suddenly broke out among children in late June and early July. More than 90 children under the age of seven were infected, and 16 of them died. However, the district government turned a blind eye to this epidemic, which seriously threatened the lives of the people, neither studying prevention methods nor reporting the situation to higher authorities. Comrade Ji Maozhong, director of the district cooperative, twice suggested to Comrade Zhang Ruixin, the district head, that he quickly report to the higher-level health authorities to find ways to prevent and control the epidemic. But Zhang Ruixin said nonchalantly, "I have already talked to the hospital (in fact, he had not talked to the hospital)." He also said, "When a child's time to die comes, can he not die?" Zhai Ruike, director of the district medical association, who lived in the village, did not treat the masses or report to the higher health authorities.

It was not until July 27th, when the child of Comrade Sun Gang, a civil affairs assistant in the Fifth District of Yanggu County, also fell ill, and dysentery was also discovered in Sanlizhuang near the town at that time, that Comrade Sun Gang called Comrade Mao Zhendai, the cultural and educational assistant in the Fourth District who was in charge of health work, asking him to find a doctor to treat the illness. But Mao Zhendai still ignored it. Comrade Sun Gang then reported to the county people's government. The county health station sent Dr. Lin from the Anlezhen Health Sub-station in the Fifth District to Qijizhen for treatment on July 28th. When Dr. Lin arrived in the town, he discussed with Mao Zhendai ways to eradicate the epidemic and organize the masses for prevention. Dr. Lin requested to convene a mass meeting in the town to mobilize the masses to treat and prevent the disease. Mao Zhendai emphasized that the masses were backward and could not be convened for a meeting. Dr. Lin finally asked, "The epidemic has developed to such a serious stage (at that time, according to preliminary statistics, there were 168 patients and 38 deaths in the four natural villages of Sanlizhuang, Sangzhuang, Dongyangzhuang, and Langji near the town), why didn't you report to the health authorities earlier?" Mao Zhendai said, "I am very busy with work, how can I have time to report?" Dr. Lin also proposed to organize local Chinese and Western medicine doctors to treat together, but Mao Zhendai still shirked responsibility and did not care about the matter.

On July 31st, Director Zhu of the county hospital inspected the epidemic situation in Qijizhen and prepared to organize forces for treatment. He went to Mao Zhendai's room to discuss with him, asking him to help mobilize the masses. Mao Zhendai still said, "There will be a teachers' meeting in the afternoon; and there is also the wheat collection work... I can't help." Director Zhu said, "No matter how important your work is, it won't kill people in a few days; if this work is not done, people will die immediately." He repeatedly asked for his help. Mao Zhendai stomped his foot and said, "You talk to Comrade Yang, the secretary of the district committee. I don't have time, I have to go to a meeting." With that, he left Director Zhu in the room and strode out.

The above situation is what we have learned from a detailed investigation on the spot. We believe that the serious bureaucratic work style of the district government has caused great damage to the lives of the people. We hope that the Yanggu County government will give the district government and derelict cadres the punishment they deserve.

Editor's Note: Judging from the letter from Comrades Zhao Xiaoting and Li Zhijing, the bureaucratic work style of the Fourth District Government of Yanggu County, Pingyuan Province is serious. The administrative cadres in charge of the district adopted an indifferent attitude towards the serious epidemic that concerns the lives of the people, and even used being busy with work and meetings as excuses to shirk the responsibility of rescuing and preventing the epidemic. This is a complete manifestation of bureaucracy. These comrades do not understand that rescuing and preventing epidemics is a very important task, and convening mass meetings to mobilize epidemic prevention is a very important meeting. We demand that the Yanggu County Government quickly investigate and understand the epidemic situation in the district, correct the serious mistakes of the district government, and earnestly carry out rescue and epidemic prevention work.

### 平原省阳谷县四区政府  有严重官僚主义作风  当地疫情严重，居然熟视无睹

　　平原省阳谷县四区政府
    有严重官僚主义作风
    当地疫情严重，居然熟视无睹编辑同志：
    我们是平原省聊城专署卫生科的干部。现在我们报告你们一件因为区政府的官僚主义而使人民生命受到严重损害的事件。希望你们在报上发表，以引起各地政府的警惕。
    平原省聊城专区阳谷县第四区七级镇（区政府驻村），在六月底、七月初突然流行儿童细菌性赤痢。七岁以下儿童患者竟达九十余人，其中死亡者有十六人。但该区区政府对这严重威胁人民生命的疫情却视若无睹，既不研究防止办法，更不把这情况向上级报告。该区合作社主任姬茂忠同志曾向该区区长张瑞信同志两次提出，请他赶快报告上级卫生机关，设法防治。但张瑞信竟毫不在意地说：“我已和医院谈了（实际上并没和医院谈过）。”并说：“小孩已到死的时候，还能不死吗？”该区医联会主任翟瑞珂，住在该村，竟不为群众治疗，也不报告上级卫生机关。
    直到七月二十七日，阳谷县第五区民政助理员孙纲同志的孩子也病了，而当时该镇附近的三里庄也发现了痢疾，孙纲同志就打电话通知第四区文教助理员并负责卫生工作的茅镇岱同志，请他设法组织医生治疗。但茅镇岱还是置之不理。孙纲同志又报告该县人民政府。县卫生所就在七月二十八日派五区安乐镇卫生分院林医生前赴七级镇治疗。林医生到了该镇，就和茅镇岱商谈扑灭病疫、组织群众预防的办法。林医生要求召开该镇群众会，以便在会上动员群众起来治病和预防。茅镇岱却强调群众落后，无法召集开会。林医生最后就问：“疫情已发展到这样严重地步（当时据初步统计，该镇附近三里庄、桑庄、东杨庄、郎集等四个自然村患者已有一百六十八人，死亡者有三十八人），你为什么不早向卫生机关报告呢？”茅镇岱竟说：“我工作很忙，那有时间报告呢？”林医生又提出要组织当地中西医生共同治疗，茅镇岱仍是一味推脱责任，不管这件事情。
    七月三十一日，该县医院朱院长到七级镇视察疫情后，准备组织力量进行治疗，就到茅镇岱房里和他商谈，请他帮助发动群众。茅镇岱仍说：“下午要开教员会；还有麦征工作……无法帮忙。”朱院长说：“你的工作再要紧，晚几天不致于死人；这个工作不做，马上看着要死人。”仍再三要求他帮助。茅镇岱把脚一跺说：“你找区委书记杨同志谈吧。我没时间，要开会去了。”说着，就把朱院长撇在屋里，大踏步出去了。
    以上情况，是我们亲赴该地详细调查来的。我们认为：该区区政府这种严重的官僚主义作风，使人民的生命受到很大损害。希望阳谷县县政府给该区区政府及渎职干部以应得处分。

                         八月十七日
    编者按：从赵晓庭、李志竞两同志的来信看来，平原省阳谷县第四区区政府的官僚主义作风是严重的。该区行政负责干部对关系人民生命的严重病疫竟采取漠不关心的态度，竟以工作忙、开会忙为借口来推卸救疫防疫的责任，这是十足官僚主义的表现。这些同志不懂得：救疫防疫工作正是很重要的工作，召开动员防疫的群众会正是很重要的会议。我们要求阳谷县政府迅速调查了解该区的疫情，纠正该区政府的严重错误，切实展开救疫防疫工作。
