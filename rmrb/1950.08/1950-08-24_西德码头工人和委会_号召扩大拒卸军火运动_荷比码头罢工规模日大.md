Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Comprehensive TASS news: The recent victory of dockworkers in Hamburg port, West Germany, in refusing to unload American and British arms, has greatly encouraged dockworkers in other parts of West Germany. Workers in the port of Lübeck, West Germany, passed a resolution on the 17th to refuse to unload arms and expressed their solidarity with their brothers in Hamburg. At the same time, the West German Peace Committee of Dockworkers, Seafarers, and Inland Waterway Workers also issued a statement of support on the 16th, pointing out that the Hamburg strike is the first step for dockworkers towards international solidarity and called for the struggle to refuse to unload arms to be expanded into a matter for the entire people.

The statement also emphasized: "The port and transport workers should be loading and unloading not arms, but goods for peaceful trade between us and the German Democratic Republic, the People's Democracies, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. Those who undermine peaceful trade betray the true interests of our people and betray peace."

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: TASS, The Hague, 17th: Newspaper reports show that the scale of the strike movement in the Netherlands and Belgium is growing. Major Western European ports such as Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and Antwerp are at a standstill. In Rotterdam, more than 10,000 dockworkers are on strike demanding higher wages. A large number of police have been concentrated in the port area of Rotterdam. Workers' gatherings have been banned.

In Amsterdam, 4,000 people are on strike. In the city center of Amsterdam, clashes occurred between striking workers and police. Police with batons and sabers attacked the marching people. Several workers were injured.

The stevedores on strike in Antwerp sent a telegram to the dockworkers in Rotterdam expressing their respect for their heroic struggle. Working people throughout the Netherlands are donating money to support the striking workers.

The Politburo of the Communist Party of the Netherlands called on the working people of the whole country to support the struggle of the port workers in Rotterdam and Amsterdam. The Politburo's proclamation to the people said that the De Drees government's military policy has drastically lowered the living standards of workers, and the strike is a protest.

Xinhua News Agency: TASS, Paris, 19th: According to the newspaper *L'Humanité*, dockworkers in Rouen refused to unload the ship "Volronisac," which was carrying arms. They continue to fight for the realization of their demands and for the defense of peace, and this is the fifteenth time they have refused to handle arms.

　　西德码头工人和委会
    号召扩大拒卸军火运动
    荷比码头罢工规模日大
    【新华社十九日讯】综合塔斯社消息：西德汉堡港码头工人最近拒绝起卸美英军火的胜利，已大大鼓舞了西德其他各地的码头工人。西德卢卑克港的工人们已于十七日通过拒绝起卸军火的决议，并对汉堡工人兄弟表示声援。同时，西德码头工人、海员和内河工人和平委员会，十六日亦发表声援声明，指出汉堡罢工是码头工人走向国际团结阵线的第一步，并号召将拒绝起卸军火的斗争扩大成为全体人民的事情。
    声明并着重指出：“港口和运输工人要装卸的不是军火，而是我们与德意志民主共和国、人民民主国家、苏联及中华人民共和国的和平时期贸易的货物。破坏和平时期贸易的人，就背叛了我国人民的真正利益，也就背叛了和平。”
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社海牙十七日讯：报纸消息显示：荷兰和比利时罢工运动的规模正越来越大。西欧大港口如鹿特丹、阿姆斯特丹和安特卫普，都陷于停顿状态。在鹿特丹，有一万多码头工人正在罢工，要求增加工资。鹿特丹港口区已经集中大量警察。工人的集会已经被禁止。
    阿姆斯特丹共有四千人罢工。在阿姆斯特丹市中心区，罢工的工人和警察间曾发生冲突。带着警棍与佩刀的警察，曾对游行的人们横施攻击。好几个工人都受了伤。
    安特卫普正在罢工中的装卸货物工人，致电鹿特丹的码头工人，对他们的英勇斗争表示敬意。全荷兰的劳动人民都在捐款支援罢工工人。
    荷兰共产党政治局号召全国劳动人民一致支援鹿特丹和阿姆斯特丹港口工人所进行的斗争。政治局的告人民书说：德里斯政府的军事政策，使工人的生活标准急剧降低，罢工就是表示抗议。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎十九日电：据《人道报》消息，卢昂码头工人们拒绝为装运军火的船只“伏龙尼萨克”号卸货。他们继续为实现他们的要求和为拥护和平而斗争，现在已经是第十五次拒绝搬运军火了。
