Mayor Nie's Report on the Implementation of the 1950 Annual Work Plan at the Third Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference

Fellow Representatives:

The Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference approved the 1950 annual work plan we proposed. Now, half a year has passed. How much of this plan has been implemented? What is the situation of implementation? I hereby report as follows:

First, I will report on the work of political power construction, judicial affairs, public security, and land reform.

In my report on the 1950 annual work plan, I pointed out: To restore and develop production, we must continue to consolidate the revolutionary order, which means we must do a good job in political power construction, judicial affairs, and public security; carry out land reform, and eliminate the remaining feudal and counter-revolutionary forces. In this regard, we have carried out the following work in the past few months:

(1) Convening District People's Representative Conferences and Merging Districts

The convening of the District People's Representative Conferences was a resolution of the last Municipal People's Representative Conference. Based on this resolution, we and the Municipal Consultative Committee made the necessary preparations and formulated the Organizational Rules for the District People's Representative Conferences, which were submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval. We first selected three districts with different characteristics for trial implementation: the First District (residential commercial area), the Sixth District (commercial area), and the Seventh District (handicraft and working people's residential area). The People's Representative Conferences in these three districts were all held very well. Through these conferences, the connection between the government and the people was further strengthened. The conferences not only solved many public welfare problems that the people in each district urgently needed to solve, but also reviewed the work of the government and the work style of the staff, and more specifically and directly realized the people's supervision of the government. The Consultative Committee has a separate report on the situation and experience of the conferences. Here, I only point out that the experience of the above three districts shows that it is necessary to universally convene District People's Representative Conferences in a city like Beijing.

In addition, in order to facilitate leadership, and under the condition of streamlining the establishment and appropriately strengthening the work of the districts, we submitted it to the Government Administration Council for approval, and have merged the twelve districts in the urban area into nine districts, and the eight districts in the suburban area into seven districts, and appropriately expanded the organizations of the district public offices in the urban area.

(2) Clearing Accumulated Court Cases and Establishing District People's Courts

Because this city has long been under feudalism and reactionary rule, there are many unreasonable phenomena and unresolved disputes in society. After liberation, people filed lawsuits one after another, demanding legal solutions. However, the cadres of the Municipal People's Court were not numerous enough and lacked experience, and their work efficiency was not high. At the same time, the organization was not sound enough. In particular, some unnecessary old systems and old methods have not been thoroughly reformed. Even very small cases must go through extremely complex and cumbersome procedures and formalities, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, resulting in a large backlog of cases. As of May 12, the number reached as many as 3,670! Therefore, in mid-May, we transferred more than 240 cadres to help the Municipal People's Court carry out a blitz cleanup. By June 22, a total of 4,328 cases, including newly received cases, had been cleared. In the work of clearing accumulated cases, we implemented the method of having trial groups stationed in various districts for trials, and adopted simplified judgments and case number slips to replace complicated judgments and mediation documents. This has achieved the effect of saving time and effort and facilitating the people. Based on these experiences, we must thoroughly improve our working methods in the future, and resolutely abandon the remnants of the old judicial system and unnecessary procedures and formalities that are still being followed.

At the same time as clearing accumulated cases, the work of preparing for the establishment of District People's Courts has also been actively carried out. It has been decided to set up three locations in the urban area, striving to realize this in August, and it is planned to try out one location in the suburban area first.

(3) Suppressing and Transforming Counter-Revolutionary Elements

In order to continue to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, in the first half of this year, we successively cracked 102 cases of various special agents. We seized 31 various guns and a radio station. We arrested 215 bandits and special agents, and gave them due punishment according to the severity of their circumstances. Among them, the ringleaders with heinous crimes, such as Ji Zhaoxiang, have been sentenced to death.

After sufficient investigation and research, the registration of special agents and reactionary party members above the college level began on March 27 this year. A total of 42 special agents and 100 reactionary party members above the district branch committee level were registered. Among them, there were 7 professors, 5 lecturers and teaching assistants, 10 staff members, and 120 students. In addition, a very small number of people who committed serious crimes, attempted to continue to lie dormant and sabotage, and refused to register have been arrested. For example, Zhai Yuwei, a special agent in Normal University, served as the pseudo-Shandong Security Brigade Commander and other positions during the Anti-Japanese War, and colluded with Japanese invaders to kill cadres in the Liberated Areas and progressive masses. After the Japanese surrender, he served as the pseudo-Jinan Suburban Garrison Commander and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. After Jinan was liberated, he sneaked into Beijing, mixed into Normal University, and posed as a student, plotting activities. This time, he refused to register and refused to confess. If we are too lenient with such people and do not arrest them, the safety of the school and social order will inevitably be threatened.

On the other hand, among the special agents and reactionary party members who have been under control, 1,070 people who have genuinely repented and reformed after a year of control and education have been announced to be released from control to show leniency. However, 17 special agents, such as Zhu Zhenxin, who are obsessed with their own ways and continue to do evil after registration, have been suppressed and arrested.

Among the 2,499 important special agents and other counter-revolutionary elements concentrated in the Qinghe Brigade, except for those with lighter crimes and better confessions who have been released, and those with serious crimes who are still being tried, the rest are subjected to labor reform in accordance with Article 7 of the Common Program, which states that "counter-revolutionary elements shall be forced to reform themselves through labor and become new people." Since January this year, a farm has been opened, and more than 1,700 of them have been sent to participate in labor. Now, their production enthusiasm is very good, and their production efficiency is constantly improving. They have gradually developed the habit of labor, and some criminals have undergone ideological changes in labor. A part of the prisoners who did not participate in farm labor were also organized for industrial production. Experience has proven that the policy of labor reform is successful.

In addition, in terms of public security work, one of the biggest achievements is that robbery cases have gradually decreased due to strengthened prevention and investigation work. A total of 137 robbery cases occurred in the first half of this year, and 179 cases were solved (including some old cases). The number of cases solved is more than the number of cases that occurred. There are very few unsolved cases. In particular, June was the month with the fewest robbery cases in the first half of the year: one in the urban area and 14 in the suburban area, eight fewer than in May. The number of new and old cases solved was 30. By July, there were even fewer robbery cases, only nine.

(4) Completing Land Reform in the Suburbs

Land reform in the suburbs officially began in October last year and was fully completed by the end of March this year. During the land reform process, due to the observance of the "Decision on Agricultural Land Issues in the Beijing Municipal Jurisdiction" promulgated by the Beijing Military Control Commission, resolutely protecting industry and commerce, not touching the land cultivated by rich peasants themselves and those who hired labor, not pursuing the floating wealth of landlords, and carefully dividing classes, no major deviations occurred. After the peasants were distributed land and the landlords' agricultural tools, livestock, and surplus grain and houses as means of production and means of livelihood, their production enthusiasm was generally high. Many farmers in the suburbs of Beijing also engage in sideline occupations, and their management of cultivated land is generally poor, but there has been progress after land reform. Most landlords have also gone to the fields to cultivate land and participate in labor. On the basis of land reform, the village administration was transformed, and a group of activists who emerged during the land reform were promoted to village cadres to replace those who were dissatisfied with the masses.

The completion of land reform is a major event. The Suburban Work Committee has a separate report, so I won't say much about it here.

(5) Eliminating Other Feudal Remnants

We have also done some work and achieved considerable success in eliminating other feudal remnants. The follow-up work of closing down brothels has come to an end. The prostitutes' venereal diseases have been treated, and their awareness has been raised after education. Now, 68% of them have married, returned home, or participated in other work. For the remaining 260 people, we have established a new cotton weaving factory to enable them to participate in production. Brothel owners and pimps were punished or released after education according to the severity of their crimes. Among them, two were sentenced to death. The hooligan organizations of feudal guilds, such as "Loubao," "Houche," and "Luoche," have been banned, and more than 60 of their ringleaders have been arrested and subjected to labor reform. Those with serious circumstances have been handed over to the court for punishment. Important members of reactionary feudal superstitious organizations, such as Liu Xieyuan of Yiguandao, have been arrested and brought to justice. They are all Japanese spies and Chiang Kai-shek bandit spies with notorious crimes. After liberation, they still actively engaged in counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of preaching. They should never be forgiven. However, those who are generally coerced and withdraw from these reactionary sects and no longer engage in activities will not be pursued.

Second, I will report on financial and economic work.

Financial and economic work, especially the restoration and development of production, is our overriding central task for 1950. In this regard, we have also achieved some success, but it is far from enough, and we need to continue to make great efforts.

In the private sector, in our report on the 1950 annual work plan, we proposed: "In addition to further improving most of the industries that have been restored and developed on the basis of the existing foundation, we should focus on supporting industries that are necessary for the development of production and the people's lives, so that they can improve or expand their equipment, improve quality, reduce costs, increase output, and expand sales"; and pointed out that we must "strengthen the direction of private enterprise management" and "continue to adjust labor-capital relations." These policies are all correct. However, due to our lack of accurate investigation and research on production and sales, we have not been able to point out in time some industries that should not be further developed or need to be scaled down for the time being. At the same time, when formulating this year's production plan for private enterprises, we set the goals for some industries too high. On the other hand, there are still shortcomings in our work in coordinating public and private enterprises to promote economic prosperity and develop production, which also hinders the realization of our policies and plans. These all need to be reviewed. Nevertheless, the production of private enterprises has developed considerably in the past six months. The main manifestation is that the average monthly output of most industries (such as ironwork, weaving and dyeing, leather making, flour, knitting, rubber, and vegetable oil) in the first half of this year exceeded the average monthly output of the entire year last year.

In the market, when prices fluctuated in November last year, we were not prepared enough, so the situation was relatively serious. After that, we made great efforts to establish retail stores and set up some cooperatives to control the supply of essential necessities for the people's livelihood, so the price fluctuations in February this year were relatively缓和. In March, the central government adopted various measures to unify financial and economic work, reversing the situation of inflation and rising prices that had lasted for 12 years, creating good conditions for the normal development of industry and commerce in the future. However, with the "cessation of false purchasing power," some industries declined because they were not suitable for the people's needs or were speculative. Some industries showed a surplus, and needed to change their business or reduce their scale. Other industries, although having development prospects, also faced temporary difficulties such as slow sales of goods and inflexible capital turnover. To this end, according to the central government's spirit of adjusting industry and commerce, we began to take the following measures in April, that is, to strengthen the guidance of the direction of industry and commerce; adjust the relationship between public and private from the aspects of processing, ordering, purchasing, consignment sales, dividing business scope, determining business proportion, and adjusting prices; call on labor and capital to cooperate to overcome difficulties; jointly organize public and private forces to invest and lend; and in order to take care of particularly difficult industrial and commercial households, reduce, exempt, or postpone the collection of 2.9 billion yuan in industrial and commercial taxes owed for the second half of 1949.

In order to deeply understand the situation and solve problems specifically, the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, together with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, organized a work group of more than 60 people to carry out this adjustment work. At the same time, three specialized groups were established under the Municipal Consultative Committee to help carry out the work. Now, considerable achievements have been made. On the one hand, a number of typical factories and stores have been selected with emphasis to help them resolve labor-capital disputes and establish labor-capital consultation meetings. Some factory workers or shop employees have voluntarily temporarily lowered labor conditions to defer or reduce wages to help the capitalists overcome difficulties (for example, Jingwei Weaving Factory lowered the original wages by 19% to 39%). On the other hand, they have helped factories undertake processing, ordering, or exchange raw materials for finished products, so that many industries, such as ironwork, knitting, cigarette, and match industries, have obtained a batch of processing, ordering, or sold part of their finished products. Therefore, most private industrial and commercial enterprises have gradually improved. Recently, we have also established a committee for the adjustment and handling of industry and commerce to be responsible for leading this adjustment work.

Among the changes in industry and commerce since March, the fluctuations in the commercial sector have been greater. In the three months of March, April, and May, a total of 950 commercial households closed down, about 207% of the 459 newly opened commercial households; while 399 factories closed down in the industrial sector, only 62% of the 640 newly opened factories. That is, the number of closures was greater than the number of openings in the commercial sector, while the number of openings was greater than the number of closures in the industrial sector. By June, industry and commerce generally began to improve, and were gradually moving towards the right track of development on the basis of real purchasing power. In June, the number of openings in the commercial sector was greater than the number of closures, and more than 40 households that had applied for closure withdrew their applications. In the industrial sector, the number of openings and employees in June were about twice as many as the number of closures. This shows that industry was less affected than commerce in this fluctuation; it also shows that the fluctuation was overcome faster than in other places. The reason why the fluctuation was able to be overcome quickly is because: First, it is surrounded by old liberated areas that have undergone land reform, and trade between urban and rural areas has been opened up. Second, under the direct leadership of the central government, there were fewer deviations in policies, and the adjustment work was started earlier. Third, it is located in the capital and has easier access to help from various central enterprise departments.

In the public sector (including public utilities), the achievements of public utilities are the most significant. The tram company has completed and exceeded the original plan in terms of both tram lines and construction. The average daily number of trams has reached 100, the tram interval has been reduced to 3.5 to 7 minutes, and the circular line has been restored, which greatly facilitates the transportation of the people in the capital. The installation of main and branch pipes by the water company has reached 58.7% of the annual plan. The water consumption population has increased to more than 920,000 in June, an increase of 350,000 compared with last year. The original plan to increase the water consumption population by 360,000 to 400,000 throughout the year has been basically completed. Although the automobile company has not yet reached the original plan of 100 trams per day, and there are shortcomings in management, the average daily number of trams has increased from 35 in January to 78, and the cost has been greatly reduced by retrofitting the May 1 gas furnace. Other relatively important enterprises, such as the flour mill, Jingxi Coal Mine, and Qinghe Woolen Mill, have basically completed their plans. Some of the remaining small factories have overfulfilled their plans, such as the newly built glass factory and Yanjing Paper Mill; some, such as the pharmaceutical factory and the kiln company, have not reached the original plan due to sluggish sales. On the other hand, there are still many shortcomings in the operation and management of our state-owned enterprises. The main ones are: Some factories and mines have not done enough in relying on employees and implementing democratic management, and they lack an economic accounting system. They have also encountered the difficulty of sluggish sales since March. As for the plan to establish new factories, some have already started construction, some have not yet started, and some have been abandoned due to changes in plans. This also shows that we have shortcomings in formulating and implementing plans.

It should be pointed out that the improvement of workers' awareness, regardless of public or private enterprises, is the most important factor in the increase of production efficiency. The city-wide workers' representative conference held in February this year determined that the task of the trade union was "production first" and called for a production competition campaign to improve quality and reduce costs. This production competition campaign can also be carried out in private enterprises under the conditions of implementing democratic management and progressive piece-rate wages. In the past few months, due to the conscious efforts of all employees, the quality of products has been improved and costs have gradually been reduced in many public and private enterprises. In the future, we must continue to work hard to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class and launch a larger-scale production competition.

In addition, in order to improve the lives of students, more than 1,600 mu of land have been allocated to major universities and middle schools for part-time agricultural production. Among them, more than 1,000 mu are good land allocated from organs and troops. In addition, the People's Bank of China lent more than 490,000 jin of millet as production capital. Now, early-maturing crops have been harvested, and the lives of students have generally been improved considerably.

In terms of financial and tax revenue work, it should be said that great achievements have been made. The basic spirit of the 1950 budget estimate is to "strive to supply Beijing's expenditures with Beijing's revenue." According to the actual situation in the past six months, it is estimated that it can be achieved. As of the end of June, calculated by the method of actual revenue and expenditure, the revenue was slightly less than 64% of the original budget (including industrial and commercial taxes belonging to the second half of last year, agricultural taxes for last year, and property taxes for last winter, etc.), and the expenditure was slightly less than 54% of the original budget. The expenditure with the most expenditure is the operating expenses, which is about 57% of the original budget, while the expenditure on administrative expenses is only 43% of the original budget. In addition, 45% of the original budget was spent on reserve funds, most of which was also used for operating expenses.

In the revenue, tax revenue accounted for 94%, which is higher than the proportion (88%) in the original budget. This shows that our tax revenue work has made great achievements. The successful completion of the tax revenue task has guaranteed the supply of our operating expenses, enabling various construction projects to be gradually realized according to plan. This is due to the support of the people of the city, especially the industrial and commercial sectors, and the efforts of all tax officials. However, there are shortcomings and errors in our tax revenue work. The central government has made some revisions and adjustments to the tax items and tax rates; some important improvements have also been made to the collection methods and procedures; this city has begun to implement them specifically according to these decisions of the central government. As for the bad styles and even corruption of some tax officials, we have been, and are still, checking and correcting them.

In addition, according to the decision of the Central Finance and Economics Commission, the collection of local surcharges in the urban area is also planned to be changed. That is, except for the real estate tax, it will no longer be levied as a surcharge in the industrial and commercial tax, but will be levied as a surcharge in the public utility fees.

Third, I will report on cultural, educational, and health work.

At the last representative conference, we proposed the guiding principle of "serving production and serving the working people" for cultural, educational, and health work. According to this guiding principle, the most central work in education is to vigorously establish spare-time literacy schools to accommodate 30,000 people. Now, this work has been basically completed. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Education, the plan to try out a secondary school for workers and peasants has also been realized. In addition, adult literacy schools and workers' literacy education have also been rectified. In the suburbs, farmers' literacy schools have been established in 152 of the 253 larger administrative villages. The above work has enabled more than 50,000 working people in this city to have the opportunity to study culture.

In school education, according to the original plan, the Bureau of Culture and Education has used great efforts to improve the quality of the existing primary and secondary schools, and paid attention to improving the lives and health conditions of students. The plan to increase classes and schools in primary schools has been carried out. Sixteen classes have been added in the urban area and 27 classes have been added in the suburban area. The increase of classes and schools in vocational schools (technical schools), normal schools, and ordinary middle schools has been prepared according to the plan. Due to the school system, students must be enrolled during the summer vacation. More than 30 private middle schools that are well-run but have financial difficulties have been subsidized according to the original plan.

In literary and artistic work, the focus is on factory literature and art, the editing of popular literary works, and the transformation of old operas. Two sessions of the opera training class have been held. A total of 1,521 students have graduated, laying a preliminary foundation for the ideological transformation and professional transformation of the opera community.

In health work, according to the original plan, emphasis has been placed on epidemic prevention, maternal and child health, industrial and mining health, and school health, and the plan to provide free treatment for poor working people by government subsidies and designated public and private hospitals has been realized. Health centers or workers' clinics have been added in Fengtai, Changxindian, the East Suburb Industrial Zone, and other areas where working people live, thus starting to correct the unbalanced distribution of medical and health institutions in this city.

Because there are also separate special reports on financial and economic work and cultural, educational, and health work, I will not say much about them here.

Fourth, I will report on municipal construction work.

The municipal construction plan formulated this year is under the guiding principle of serving production, serving the people, and serving the capital. It focuses on building sanitary engineering and road engineering within the scope of what the people urgently need and what the government can do. As of the end of June, a total of about 78% of the original annual plan for sanitary engineering (dredging rivers and lakes, sewers, etc.) has been completed, exceeding the original semi-annual plan; and about 53% of the original annual plan and the temporarily added projects for road engineering and construction engineering have been completed.

(1) Sewerage Engineering: Six major system ditches including Nanbeigouyan, An Dingmennei, Chongwenmen, Chaoyangmen, Beixinhua Street, Qipan Street and Dashiqiao have been dug up, with a total length of 81,550 meters and 39,820 cubic meters of mud removed. By the end of June, 2,218 meters of ditch body had been renovated in the sewer construction project; 11,758 meters of ditch body had been repaired and the ditch bottom improved. The Longxugou renovation project, which is 8,040 meters long, was completed in late July. The culvert projects for the famous waterlogged area of Paozihe in the southeast corner of the inner city, the waterlogged area of Xinpi Ku Hutong in the west city and in front of Xinhuamen have been basically completed for drainage. The culvert for draining water from the Xiangbizikeng waterlogged area has now started.

(2) River and Lake Engineering: In terms of dredging rivers, work began in February when the river ice had not completely melted to save time. By the end of June, the Jinhe, Changhe, and the moats surrounding the inner and outer cities had been dredged; the Tongzihe River surrounding the Forbidden City had also been completed. A total of 59,772 meters have been dredged, 772,599 cubic meters of earth have been dredged, and 484,920 workers have been used. All ten machine wells used to increase the amount of water have been dug. The construction of the gates of Yuquan Mountain, Songlin, Qinglong, etc. has been one-third completed.

In terms of dredging lakes, the Three Seas dredging project was completed long ago. The troops and civilians participating in the work reached 10,000 per day. A total of 343,261 cubic meters of earth were dredged, and 329,944 workers were used. Now, the Three Seas revetment project has also been completed and water has been released. The rapid completion of the Three Seas dredging project played a major role in the efforts of the officers and soldiers of the Public Security Forces and the assistance of the motor transport corps of the North China Military Region. In addition, the project of dredging Shichahai and Jishuitan, which was not in the original plan, has also started. It is estimated that 280,000 cubic meters of earth must be dredged, and one-third has now been completed, and revetment work is being done, striving to complete it by the end of September.

(3) Environmental Sanitation Engineering: Ten public toilets, twelve urinals, and sixteen sewage ponds have been built, and other new sewage ponds, infiltration wells, etc. are planned to be constructed separately. Since March, garbage has been transported to the outer city to fill low-lying areas.

(4) Road Engineering: Of the ten main roads planned to be newly paved this year, together with the eighteen important dirt roads in hutongs, the original plan was to complete 41.7% of the annual project by the end of June, and the actual completion was 44.2%. The area of the four roads of Taipusi Street, Xuannei Street, Xizhimen and Chongwenmen, which were temporarily added, is more than 19,000 square meters, of which Taipusi Street and Xuannei Street have been completed. The original plan for the 18 important dirt roads was to pave most of them with cinder pavement, but now it is planned to pave most of them with cobblestone or simple stone ballast pavement without increasing the construction cost. Among them, Dongzhimen Beixiaojie has been completed, and the remaining roads are being constructed in order, and are scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. The original plan for the maintenance of old roads was to complete 47.5% by the end of June, and the actual completion was 66.6%, exceeding the original plan by 19.1%. In addition, the newly planned afforestation project on Chang'an Street in the east and west has now started.

(5) Construction Engineering: The opening of the Xizhimen gap project has been slightly expanded in order to completely solve the traffic congestion problem, and the road project and the addition of two gap archways have been temporarily added, both of which are nearing completion. All the expenses for the new engineering added are entirely from savings and transfers, and no additional budget is added. The project of demolishing the urn city and adding a gate opening in Chongwenmen was not included in this year's plan. It was a temporary decision to add it. As of the end of June, this project has completed 70% of the demolition work and 30% of the demolition and transportation of city bricks and earthwork.

Of the 1,933 public-owned houses that need to be repaired after inspection, 1,472 have been repaired, 212 are to be repaired, and 249 are under repair. In addition, 200 new workers' dormitories are being built in Gongyuan West Street in Inner District 1, and 100 new office buildings are being built in Inner District 5 and Suburban District 13. As for the 154 houses confiscated from brothel owners and pimps that had been allocated as workers' dormitories, 28 of them, about 420 rooms, must be repaired as soon as possible, and they have now been completed.

It can be seen from this that great achievements have been made in municipal construction, but there are still shortcomings, mainly insufficient planning and poor quality of some projects. This needs to be reviewed and improved.

Finally, I will report on unemployment relief work.

This city has a relatively large number of unemployed and jobless people because it is a large consumer city under the long-term rule of imperialism and domestic reactionaries. Especially after the Japanese surrender, during the three years of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang, national industry was greatly devastated, industry and commerce were in decline, and the unemployed population increased greatly. Since liberation, a considerable number of intellectuals have joined work and study, and the number of workers employed has increased due to the initial restoration and development of production. For example, the number of workers in state-owned industries and private factories and workshops has increased by about 30,410 compared with the early days of liberation. Therefore, the unemployed population has decreased significantly compared with before liberation. But on the other hand, in the process of economic restructuring, a part of the workers and shop assistants in industries that do not meet the needs of the people and are surplus are temporarily unemployed, and many poor and jobless citizens do not have sufficient employment opportunities. "Work relief is the main method, and production for self-rescue, occupational training, returning to the countryside for production, and issuing relief funds are supplementary methods," which is the general policy for relieving unemployment stipulated by the central government. Since liberation, we have adopted methods such as work relief, returning to the countryside for production, immigrating to Chahar, Suiyuan and Northeast China, introducing occupational changes, and going to Benxi Coal Mine and other places for employment to reduce the unemployed population in this city. A total of 18 batches of immigrants, 7,197 people, 6,865 people returned to the countryside for production, 397 people went to Benxi and other places for employment, and about 4,000 people regularly participated in work relief. The total number of people is about 18,459. In addition, 2,665 people have been introduced to change careers or find employment and participate in production cooperatives in this city. Since February, the "Decision on Relieving Unemployed Employees" has been implemented. These methods are in line with the general policy stipulated by the central government. But what we have done is far from enough, and we lack unified planning, unified steps, and unified leadership. The thorough solution of the unemployment problem depends on the longer-term economic recovery and development in the future, but today, we must help the unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals overcome their current difficulties with a very concerned and responsible attitude, so that the poor and jobless citizens can also receive the necessary relief and gradually obtain employment opportunities. Recently, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Relieving Unemployed Workers" and the "Provisional Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers." According to the spirit of these instructions and measures, we have formulated measures to strengthen and expand relief work. Because there are also separate reports on this issue, I will not go into detail here.

The above is the situation of our implementation of the 1950 annual work plan since the Second Session of the Second People's Representative Conference.

In addition, in order to overcome bureaucracy and improve work efficiency, we have selected several units for work inspection, which has been of great help to the improvement of work. The experience of this inspection work needs to be promoted to all departments, and the inspection work needs to be established as a regular working system. But more importantly, bureaucracy exists in ourselves and needs to be seriously reviewed. We have decided to start with inspecting the leadership in the rectification campaign that is about to be carried out.

Among the work we have carried out, great achievements have been made in eliminating feudal remnants and counter-revolutionary forces and continuing to consolidate social order. The social order of the capital is more consolidated than before. In terms of municipal construction, we have completed most of the annual work and exceeded the planned progress. In terms of education work, it has been generally realized according to the plan, but a considerable part of it is prepared before the summer vacation and can only be realized after the summer vacation. Our most central task is to restore and develop production. The situation encountered is more complex and there are more difficulties. Although we have overcome many difficulties and received many achievements due to the awareness of the working class, coupled with the efforts of all parties, we are still far from our requirements. This requires us to review the past and encourage the future. Our central task for the next six months is still to restore and develop production, and continuing to adjust industry and commerce and adjust labor-capital relations is still an important link in restoring and developing production. We must continue to use great efforts to carry out these work. Secondly, we also need to use more effort to do a good job in cultural and educational work.

Fellow representatives, this is the report I made on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. I hope the conference will review and criticize it.

　　在北京市第二届第三次各界人民代表会议上
    聂市长关于执行一九五○年度工作计划的报告各位代表：
    第二届第二次各界人民代表会议曾通过了我们所提出的一九五○年度工作计划，现在已经半年了。这一计划究竟执行了多少？执行的情况怎样？谨报告如下：
    首先，报告政权建设、司法、公安、土地改革等工作。
    我在关于一九五○年度工作计划的报告中，曾经指出：为了恢复和发展生产，必须继续巩固革命秩序，也就是必须做好政权建设和司法、公安工作；进行土地改革，肃清残余封建势力和反革命势力。在这一方面，几个月中间，我们进行了以下的工作：
    （一）召开区各界人民代表会议和并区
    区各界人民代表会议的召开，是上次市各界人民代表会议的决议。根据这一决议，我们和市协商委员会曾进行了必要的准备，并制定了区各界人民代表会议组织通则，呈经政务院批准。先选择第一（居民商业区），第六（商业区），第七（手工业和劳动人民居住区）等三个性质不同的区试办。这三个区的各界人民代表会议都开得很好。经过这些会议，更进一步密切了政府和人民的联系。在会议中，不仅解决了各该区人民迫切需要解决的许多公共福利问题，而且检讨了政府的工作和工作人员的作风，更具体地、更直接地、实现了人民对政府的监督。关于会议的情况和经验，协商委员会另有报告。我在这里，只指出这一点，即以上三个区的经验说明，像北京这样的城市，普遍召开区各界人民代表会议是必要的。
    此外，为了便于领导，在精简编制的条件下，适当加强区的工作，我们呈经政务院批准，已将城区十二个区并为九个区，郊区八个区并为七个区，并将城区区公所的机构适当地加以扩大。
    （二）清理法院积案和建立区人民法院
    由于本市长期处在封建制度和反动统治之下，社会上存在着许多不合理现象和未解决的纠纷，解放以后，纷纷起诉，要求依法解决。而市人民法院干部既不够多，且缺乏经验，工作效率不高，同时，机构也不够健全。特别是对一些不必要的旧制度、旧办法还没有彻底改革，很小的案件也须经过极复杂而烦琐的程序和手续，费时费事，以致积案甚多。到五月十二日止，竟达三千六百七十件之多！因此，我们于五月中旬抽调了二百四十多个干部，帮助市人民法院进行突击清理，到六月二十二日止，连同新收的案件，共清理了四千三百二十八件。在清理积案工作中，我们实行了审判组分驻各区就审的办法，并采用了简易判决书，卷号单等以代替繁杂的判决书和调解书。这样做，收到了省时省事，便利人民的效果。根据这些经验，今后必须彻底改进工作方法，坚决废弃现在仍沿袭着的旧司法制度的残余和不必要的程序和手续。
    与清理积案同时，筹设区人民法院的工作也已积极进行，城区决定设三处，争取在八月份实现，郊区拟先试办一处。
    （三）镇压和改造反革命分子
    为了继续肃清反革命分子，在本年上半年，我们先后破获了各种特务案件一百零二起。缴获各种枪枝三十一支，电台一部。逮捕匪特二百一十五人，已分别情节轻重，给予应得惩处。其中，罪大恶极的首要分子如计兆祥等，已判处死刑。
    对于专科以上学校的特务和反动党团分子，经过充分的调查研究之后，从今年三月二十七日起，开始登记。计共登记特务四十二名，区分部委员以上反动党团分子一百名。其中，教授七名，讲师、助教五名，职员十名，学生一百二十名。另外，一些罪行重大，且企图继续潜伏破坏，拒绝登记的极少数人则已予逮捕。例如：师大特务翟毓蔚，在抗日战争时期，即历任伪山东保安旅长等职，并与日寇勾结，杀害解放区干部和进步群众甚多。日寇投降后，又任伪济南城郊警备司令，继续进行反革命活动。济南解放后，潜来北京，混入师大，冒充学生，阴谋活动。此次，又拒绝登记，不肯坦白。对于这样的人，如果过分宽大，不加逮捕，则学校安全和社会秩序，将必受到破坏的威胁。
    另一方面，对于已被管制的特务分子和反动党团分子中间，经过一年来管制教育，确已悔过自新的一千零七十人，已宣布解除管制，以示宽大。但对少数执迷不悟，登记后，仍继续为非作恶的特务分子如朱枕薪等十七名则实行镇压，加以逮捕。
    对于集中在清河大队的重要特务及其他反革命分子二千四百九十九人，除其中罪恶较轻，坦白较好的已经释放，罪恶重大的还在进行审判外，其余均按照共同纲领第七条“对反革命分子，强迫他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人”的规定，实行劳动改造。从今年一月起，即开办农场一所，将他们中间的一千七百余人送往参加劳动，现在生产情绪都很好，且生产效率不断提高，逐渐养成了劳动的习惯，部分犯人在劳动中，思想上已有所转变。没有参加农场劳动的一部分在押犯人也组织了工业生产。经验证明，劳动改造的政策是成功的。
    此外，在治安工作方面，最大的成绩之一，就是由于加强防范和侦缉工作，而抢劫案件逐渐减少了。今年上半年共发生抢案一百三十七起，破获一百七十九起（其中包括一些旧案），破获的案件较发生的案件还多。未破获的案件极少。特别是六月份，是上半年发生抢劫案件最少的一个月：城区一起，郊区十四起。比五月份减少八起。而破获的新旧案件则有三十起。到七月份，发生抢劫案件更少，只有九起。
    （四）完成郊区土地改革
    郊区土地改革，从去年十月正式开始，至今年三月底，已全部完成。在进行土地改革当中，由于遵照本市军管会所颁布的“关于本市辖区农业土地问题的决定”，坚决地保护工商业，不动富农自耕和雇工耕种的土地，不追地主浮财，并慎重地划分阶级，所以没有发生大的偏差。农民分得了土地和分得了地主的农具、耕畜和多余的粮食、房屋作为生产资料和生活资料后，生产情绪普遍高涨。京郊农民兼营副业的很多，一般对耕地经营较差，但土地改革后已有进步。大多数地主也已下地耕作，参加劳动。并在土地改革的基础上，改造了村政权，提拔了土地改革当中涌现出来的一部分积极分子做村干部，以代替被淘汰的那些为群众所不满的分子。
    土地改革的完成是一件大事。郊区工作委员会另有报告，我在这里就不多说了。
    （五）肃清其他封建残余
    关于肃清其他封建残余，我们也做了一些工作并获得相当成绩。封闭妓院的善后工作已告结束，妓女们的性病已得到治疗，经过教育后，觉悟也已提高，现在已有百分之六十八结婚、回家或参加其他工作。剩下的二百六十余人，我们已办了一所新生棉织厂，使他们参加生产。妓院老板和领家则按罪恶大小，分别处刑或教育释放。其中，两人被处死刑。封建行会的流氓组织如“搂包”“猴车”、“锣车”等，已被取缔，逮捕了其中首要分子六十余名，加以劳动改造，情节重大的交由法院治罪。反动的封建迷信组织，一贯道的重要分子刘燮元等已被逮捕法办。他们都是罪恶昭彰的日本特务和蒋介石匪帮特务，解放后以传道为掩护，仍积极进行反革命活动，对于他们是决不应该宽恕的。但对一般胁从分子只要退出这些反动道门，不再活动，即不加追究。（⑴⑷）
  其次，报告财经工作。
    财经工作，特别是恢复与发展生产，是我们一九五○年度压倒一切的中心工作。在这方面，我们也曾获得一些成绩，但很不够，还需要继续作极大的努力。
    在私营企业方面，我们关于一九五○年度工作计划的报告中曾提出了：“除对大部分已经恢复和发展了的行业，从现有的基础上，更提高一步外，并有重点地，用较多的力量去扶植在发展生产和人民生活上所必需的行业，使其改进或扩充设备，提高质量，减低成本，增加产量，扩大销路”；并指出：必须“加强私营企业经营的方向指导”和“继续调整劳资关系”。这些方针，都是正确的。但是由于我们对于产销情况缺乏精确的调查研究，致对有些暂时不应再发展，或需要缩小经营的行业，没有能够及时指出，同时，在制订今年度私营企业的生产计划时，对一部分行业把目标提得高了一些，另一方面，我们在协调公私营企业，以繁荣经济，发展生产的工作方面，也还存在着缺点，这对于实现我们的方针和计划也有妨碍。这些都是需要检讨的。虽然如此，半年来私营企业的生产还是有相当发展的。主要表现在，大部分行业（如铁工、织染、制革、面粉、针织、橡胶、植物油等业）今年上半年的平均月产量都超过了去年全年的平均月产量。
    在市场方面，当去年十一月间，物价波动时，因为我们准备不够，所以表现得比较严重。其后，我们用大力建立零售店，并增设一些合作社，掌握了主要民生必需品的供应，因而今年二月间的物价波动，较为缓和。三月间，由于中央采取了统一财经工作的各项措施，扭转了十二年来通货膨胀，物价高涨的局势，为今后工商业正常的发展，创造了良好的条件。但是，随着“虚假购买力的停止”，有些行业因不适合人民需要，或带有投机性，而表现衰落，有些行业表现出过剩的状况，需要转业或减少，另有些行业虽有发展前途，但也面对着商品滞销和资金周转不灵的暂时困难。为此，我们根据中央调整工商业的精神，于四月间，就开始采取了下列措施，即加强工商业的方向指导；从加工、定货、收购、代销、划分经营范围、确定经营比重、调整价格等方面，调整公私关系；号召劳资协力度过困难；联合公私力量，组织投资放款；并为了照顾特别困难的工商户，共减、免或缓征欠纳的一九四九年度下半年工商业税二十九亿元。
    为了深入了解情况，具体解决问题，特由市财经委员会会同市总工会和工商联合会组织了六十余人的工作组去进行这一调整工作。同时，在市协商委员会下，也成立了三个专门小组帮助进行。现在，已经收到了相当成绩。一方面，有重点地选择了一些典型的工厂、商店，帮助其解决劳资纠纷，成立劳资协商会议。有些工厂、商店的工人或店员，自动地暂时降低劳动条件缓领或少领工资，以帮助资方度过困难（例如经纬织布厂降低了原工资的百分之十九至三十九）。另一方面，帮助各厂承揽加工、定货、或原料换成品，使许多行业如铁工、针织、卷烟、火柴等业都得到一批加工、定货或卖出了部分成品。因而多数私营工商业已逐步好转。最近，我们又成立了工商业调整处理委员会负责领导这一调整工作。
    在三月份以来工商业的变化当中，商业方面的波动较大。三、四、五月三个月合计，歇业的商户是九百五十户，约为开业商户四百五十九户的百分之二百零七；而工业方面歇业的工厂是三百九十九户，仅为开业工厂六百四十户的百分之六十二。即商业是歇业多于开业，而工业则是开业多于歇业。到六月份，工商业一般地已开始好转，并在真实购买力的基础上，正逐渐走向发展的正轨。六月份，商业的开业户已多于歇业户，并且有曾经申请歇业的四十余户撤销歇业申请。工业方面，则六月份开业的户数和职工人数都比歇业的约多一倍。这说明在这一次波动中，工业所受的影响较商业为轻；也说明这次波动的度过比较别的地方为快。波动所以能够度过得快，是因为：第一、周围是经过土地改革的老解放区，城乡贸易已经沟通。第二、在中央直接领导之下，政策上偏差较少，且着手进行调整较早。第三、地处首都，得到中央各企业部门的帮助较便。
    在公营企业方面（包括着公用事业），公用事业的成绩最显著。电车公司无论在车路和修建方面，都完成并超过了原订计划。每日出车平均已达百辆，行车间隔已经减为三分半到七分钟，并恢复了环行路，大大便利了首都人民的交通。自来水公司干支管的安装已达全年计划的百分之五十八点七。用水人口六月份已增至九十二万余人，较去年增加三十五万人，原订全年增加三十六万到四十万用水人口的计划已基本完成。汽车公司虽还没有达到原订每日出车百辆的计划，管理方面也有缺点，但平均每日出车已由一月份的三十五辆增加到七十八辆，并由于改装五一式煤气炉而大大减低了成本。其他企业比较重要的如面粉厂、京西煤矿、清河制呢厂都已基本上完成了计划。其余小厂有的超额完成了计划，如新建玻璃厂、燕京造纸厂等；有的如制药厂、窑业公司等则因滞销关系，没有达到原订计划。另一方面，我们的公营企业在经营管理上也还存在着不少缺点。主要是：有一部分厂矿在依靠职工，实行民主管理方面，还做得不够，且缺少经济核算制。三月份以来也遭遇了商品滞销的困难。至于建立新厂的计划，则一部分已经开工，一部分尚未进行，有些由于改变计划而放弃了。这也说明我们在制订计划和执行计划上是有缺点的。
    应该指出，无论公私企业，职工觉悟的提高，都是生产效率上升的最重要因素。今年二月召开的全市职工代表大会，确定了工会的任务是“生产第一”，并号召进行提高质量，减低成本的生产竞赛运动。这种生产竞赛运动，在实行民主管理和超额累进工资制的条件下，在私营企业中也可同样进行。几个月以来，由于全体职工自觉的努力，在许多公私企业中，生产品的质量已有改善，成本也逐渐减低。今后，我们还须继续努力，发挥工人阶级的积极性和创造性，展开更大规模的生产竞赛。
    此外，为了改善学生的生活，曾抽拨土地一千六百余亩，分配给各大中学校，进行业余的农业生产。其中，有一千余亩是从机关部队中抽拨出来的好地。另外，由人民银行贷款四十九万余斤小米，做为生产资本。现在，早熟作物已经收获，学生的生活已普遍地得到相当改善。
    在财政税收工作方面，应该说是有很大成绩。一九五○年度收支概算的基本精神，是“争取以北京市的收入，供北京市的开支”。根据半年来的实际情形，估计是可以做到的。截至六月底止，按实收实支的方法计算，收入为原概算的百分之六十四弱（其中，包括属于去年下半年的工商业税，去年的农业税和去年冬季的房产税等），支出为原概算的百分之五十四弱。支出最多的是事业费，约为原概算所列的百分之五十七，而行政费的支出仅为原概算所列的百分之四十三。此外，预备费开支了原概算所列的百分之四十五，大部分也是用于事业费方面。
    在收入中，税收占百分之九十四，较原概算中所占的比例（百分之八十八）为高。这说明我们的税收工作，是有很大成绩的。由于税收任务的胜利完成，才保证了我们事业费的供给，使各项建设事业得以按照计划逐步实现。这要归功于全市人民，特别是工商业界对政府的支持以及全体税务工作人员的努力。但是，在我们的税收工作中，是存在着缺点和错误的。属于税目和税率方面的，中央已有所修正和调整；在征收的办法和手续上，也作了一些重要的改进；本市已根据中央的这些决定开始具体执行。至于少数税务工作人员的某些不良作风，甚至贪污行为，我们过去已经，现在仍在加以检查和纠正。
    此外，城区地方附加的征收，根据中央财经委员会的决定，也拟有所变更。即除房地产税外，不再在工商业税中附征，改由公用事业收费中附征。
  第三、报告文教卫生工作。
    在上次代表会议上关于文教卫生工作，我们曾提出了“为生产服务，为劳动人民服务”的方针。根据这个方针，教育工作方面最中心的工作，就是以大力创办容纳三万人的业余补习学校。现在这一工作，已基本完成。在教育部领导下，试办一所工农速成中学的计划也已实现。此外，对成人补习学校和工人补习教育也进行了整顿。郊区的农民补习学校，在二百五十三个较大的行政村中已建立起一百五十二校。以上这些工作，使得本市五万余劳动人民获得了学习文化的机会。
    在学校教育方面，按照原订计划，文教局用了很大的力量去提高原有的中小学的质量，并注意改善学生的生活和卫生状况。小学方面增班增校计划，已经进行，城区已增十六班，郊区已增二十七班。职业学校（技术学校）、师范学校和普通中学的增班增校已按照计划作了准备工作，因学制关系，须在暑期招生。对办理较好而经费困难的私立中学三十余校，按原计划给予了补助。
    在文艺工作方面，是着重工厂文艺，通俗文艺读物编辑和旧戏曲的改造工作。戏曲界讲习班已办过两期。毕业学员共一千五百二十一人，初步打下了戏曲界思想改造和业务改造的基础。
    在卫生工作方面，根据原订计划，着重进行了防疫，妇幼卫生，工矿、学校卫生等工作，并实现了由政府补助，指定公私医院为贫苦劳动人民免费治疗的计划。在丰台、长辛店、东郊工业区和其他劳动人民聚居的地区分别增设了卫生所或工人诊疗所，从而已开始矫正了本市医疗卫生机关分布不平衡的状态。
    关于财经工作和文教卫生工作，因为都还另有专题报告，所以，我在这里也不多说了。
  第四、报告市政建设工作。
    本年度所制订的市政建设计划，是在为生产服务，为人民服务，为首都服务的方针下，就当前人民所迫切需要而又为政府力量所能及的范围，着重地修建卫生工程和道路工程。截至六月底，总计卫生工程（疏浚河湖、下水道等）约完成了原订全年计划的百分之七十八，已超过原订半年的计划；而道路工程和建筑工程等约完成了原订全年计划和临时增加工程的百分之五十三。
    （一）下水道工程：已掏挖完南北沟沿、安定门内、崇文门、朝阳门、北新华街、棋盘街、大石桥等六大系统沟道，计共长八万一千五百五十公尺，掏泥三万九千八百二十公方。下水道修建工程至六月底，共翻修沟身二千二百一十八公尺；补修沟身和改善沟底一万一千七百五十八公尺。龙须沟改建暗沟工程，共长八千零四十公尺，已于七月下旬竣工。内城东南角著名积水区泡子河，西城新皮库胡同和新华门前的积水区，为泄水而新建的暗沟工程，现在都已基本完成。象鼻子坑积水区泄水的暗沟现已开工。
    （二）河湖工程：浚河方面，二月间，河冰未全融解时，即争取时间开始工作。金河、长河和环绕内外城的各护城河，截至六月下旬，均已疏浚完毕；环绕紫禁城的筒子河也已竣工。总计已疏长五万九千七百七十二公尺，浚土七十七万二千五百九十九公方，用工四十八万四千九百二十个。用以增加水量的机井十眼已全凿成。修建玉泉山、松林、青龙等各闸的工程已完成三分之一。
    浚湖方面，三海疏浚工程早已竣工，参加工作的部队、民工日达万人，共计浚土三十四万三千二百六十一公方，用工三十二万九千九百四十四个。现在，三海护岸工程也已完工，并已放水。三海疏浚工程的迅速完成，公安部队指战员的努力和华北军区运输部汽车兵团的协助起了很大作用。另外，不在原计划内的疏浚什刹海、积水潭工程也已开工，预计须浚土二十八万公方，现已完成三分之一，并做护岸工程，争取九月底完成。
    （三）环境卫生工程：已修建公厕十座，尿池十二座，整修秽水池十六座，其他新建秽水池，渗水井等计划，即陆续分别施工。垃圾自三月份起，已开始运往外城填垫洼地。
    （四）道路工程：今年计划新铺的十条干路，连同十八条重要胡同土路，原定于六月底完成全年工程的百分之四十一点七，实际完成了百分之四十四点二。而临时增加的太仆寺街、宣内大街、西直门和崇文门等四条道路，面积是一万九千余平方公尺，其中，太仆寺街和宣内大街已完成。十八条重要土路，原计划大部铺成煤碴路面，现拟在不增加工程费的原则下，大部改铺卵石或简易石碴路面。其中，东直门北小街已完工，其余各路正在次第施工，预定年底完成。保养旧路原计划在六月底完成百分之四十七点五，实际已完成百分之六十六点六，超过原计划百分之十九点一。此外，新计划的东西长安街林荫大道工程，现已开工。
    （五）建筑工程：开辟西直门豁口工程，为彻底解决交通拥挤问题，已将原计划略为扩大，临时追加道路工程和添砌两处豁口门洞，都已接近完成。所有增加新工程的费用，完全出于节约匀支，不另追加预算。崇文门拆除瓮城，增辟门洞工程，原不在今年度计划之内，是临时决定增加的。这一工程截至六月底，已完成拆房工作的百分之七十，拆运城砖土方工作的百分之三十。
    公有房屋经过检查需要修缮的共一千九百三十三处，其中已修的一千四百七十二处，待修的二百十二处，正在施工修缮的二百四十九处。此外，准备在内一区贡院西大街新建工人宿舍二百间，现已施工，在内五区和郊十三区新建机关用房百间也已开工。至于原已拨作工人宿舍的没收妓院老板、领家的房屋一百五十四处中，有二十八处，约四百二十余间，须尽先修理，现在已将竣工。
    由此可以看出，市政建设工作是有很大成绩的，但是也还存在着缺点，主要是计划性不够和有些工程质量差。这是需要检讨和改进的。
  最后，报告失业救济工作。
    本市因为是帝国主义和国内反动派长期统治下的一个大的消费城市，失业和无业的人口比较多。特别是在日本投降后，国民党反动统治三年中间，民族工业受到很大摧残，工商业凋敝，失业人口大增。解放以来，一方面已有相当数量的知识分子参加了工作和学习，且由于生产的初步恢复和发展，就业的工人也已增加。例如：公营工业和私营工厂作坊中的工人，即比解放初期增加了约三万零四百一十人。因此，失业人口较解放以前已减少了许多。但另一方面，在经济的改组过程中，又有一部分不合乎人民需要和过剩行业的工人和店员暂时失业，而不少贫苦无业的市民也还没有充分的就业机会。“以工代赈为主，以生产自救、转业训练、还乡生产、发放救济金为补助办法”，是中央所规定的救济失业的总方针。解放以来，我们曾经采取了以工代赈、还乡生产、向察绥和东北移民、介绍转业和赴本溪煤矿等处就业等办法以减少本市的失业人口，计移民十八批，七千一百九十七人，还乡生产六千八百六十五人，赴本溪等处就业三百九十七人，以工代赈经常参加工作的约四千人，共约一千八千四百五十九人。此外，介绍在本市转业或就业和参加生产合作社的，还有二千六百六十五人。从二月份起，并已实行了“关于救济失业员工的决定”，这些办法都是符合于中央所规定的总方针的。但是我们所做的这些，还很不够，且缺乏统一计划，统一步骤和统一领导。失业问题的彻底解决，固有待于今后较长期的经济恢复和发展，但今天，我们必须以十分关切和负责的态度去帮助失业的工人和失业的知识分子度过目前的困难，使贫苦无业的市民也得到必要的救济，并逐步获得就业的机会。最近，中央人民政府政务院发布了“关于救济失业工人的指示”和“救济失业工人的暂行办法”。根据这些指示和办法的精神，我们已拟具了加强和扩大救济工作的办法。关于这个问题，因为还另有报告，我在这里不详细说了。
    以上就是第二届第二次各界人民代表会议以来，我们执行一九五○年度工作计划的情况。
    此外，我们为了克服官僚主义，提高工作效率，曾选择了几个单位作了工作检查，对工作的改进有很大的帮助。这次检查工作的经验，需要推广到各部门去，并需要把检查工作定为经常的工作制度。但更重要的是我们本身就存在着官僚主义，需要认真检讨。我们已决定在即将进行的整风工作中，首先从检查领导做起。
    在我们所进行的这些工作当中，关于肃清封建残余和反革命势力，继续巩固社会秩序方面，是有很大成绩的，首都的社会秩序比较以前更加巩固了。在市政建设方面，我们已经完成了全年工作中的大部分，且超过了预定的进度。在教育工作方面，一般按照计划实现了，不过其中有相当一部分是暑假前进行准备，暑假后才能实现的。而我们最中心的任务，即恢复与发展生产。所遇到的情况则较为复杂，困难也较多。虽然由于工人阶级的觉悟，配合以各方面的努力，我们已经克服了很多困难，收到了很多成绩，但是距离我们的要求还很远。这需要我们检讨过去，策励将来。我们今后半年的中心工作，仍然是恢复与发展生产，而继续调整工商业和调整劳资关系，仍然是恢复与发展生产的重要环节，我们必须继续用很大的力量进行这些工作。其次，我们也需要用较多的力量去作好文教工作。
    各位代表，这就是我代表北京市人民政府所做的报告，希望大会审查和批评。
