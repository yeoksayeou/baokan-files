[This newspaper reports from] Kaifeng: The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters, after a preliminary inspection of the Yellow River flood control work, has issued instructions to further strengthen flood control work. The instructions first pointed out that: We are currently in the rainy season, and floods may arrive at any time. Quickly completing all preparations for flood control is the key to ensuring that the dikes do not break.

The instructions describe the progress of the current Yellow River flood control work, stating: Since the central and provincial flood control conferences, and through the efforts of cadres at all levels, in early July, each province, county, and district convened cadre meetings, representative meetings, and flood control meetings, established flood control headquarters at all levels, and meticulously conducted research and deployment work. In particular, after the establishment of the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters, each province, under the personal leadership of responsible comrades of the CCP Committee and the People's Government, conducted dike inspections and discovered many hidden dangers and weaknesses in the strength of the dike lines and embankments, which are now being remedied. Long-term flood control personnel, who have been mobilized and selected, have already been sent to the dike lines. Cadres and some of the masses have basically been mobilized. The main experience of this period is: convening flood control representative meetings, deploying flood control work, correcting the thinking of cadres, and conducting in-depth mobilization through various rural organizations are important links in mobilizing the masses.

The instructions then emphasized that although various places have made achievements, the following problems still exist and urgently need to be resolved:

	Reverse Paralysis, Overcome Commandism, and Deepen Flood Control Work Among the Masses

First, flood control work must be deepened among the masses. According to various materials, flood control work is still basically limited to district and village cadres, and the broad masses have not been fully mobilized. Many ideological problems among cadres and the masses have not been resolved. The situation is relatively good below Puyang and Juancheng counties, but because there have been no breaches in previous years, everyone believes that the dikes have been strengthened and there is a "no problem" mentality. The masses in Shandong say: "We have never seen such good dam work," "There won't be a breach here. If there's a big flood, there would have been trouble upriver!" The masses in Henan say: "We haven't been on the滩 [shoals] here for decades. Cadres, don't worry. If a big flood really tests the dikes, we'll all be Yangs [a patriotic family], with our children and wives!" At the same time, some cadres, because they are not clear about the characteristics of the Yellow River, cannot convince the masses about these ideological problems and ask the repair sections for solutions. Some adopt coercive methods, announcing to the masses "organize well in a few days," "conduct military exercises on a certain day," and even saying "this year there will be a big flood, wherever there's a breach, kill the leader there." As a result, this approach has failed. However, some cadres have adopted the method of visiting and holding forums through various organizations, citing examples of disasters to enlighten the masses' thinking, so that the masses consciously take active action. All counties and sections that have followed this path have been successful. The commandism of some cadres must be strictly criticized.

	Conduct a Serious Universal Inspection to Completely Eliminate Hidden Dangers in the Dike Body

Second, eliminating hidden dangers in the dike body is a task that cannot be delayed any longer and must be carried out seriously and quickly with effective methods. According to preliminary understanding, many water gullies and wave nests have not been repaired. Even those that have been repaired have only had the soil on both sides of the gully loosened inward and some new soil added, without tamping, resulting in no improvement. More seriously, there are many hidden dangers in the dikes above the Henan and Pingyuan dam heads. Initial inspections have found as many as 1,298 badger and fox burrows. Furthermore, the strength of some embankments is insufficient, materials are incomplete, and some dike lines do not meet the required repair standards. If they are tested by floods, disasters will inevitably result. Therefore, it is necessary to seriously and quickly conduct a universal inspection in accordance with the central government's instructions and strive to completely eliminate hidden dangers in the dike body in the shortest possible time.

	Oppose Last-Minute Preparations and Isolated Work, Achieve Preparedness and Ensure That the Dikes Do Not Break

Third, all preparations must be completed quickly, and the work style of last-minute preparations and isolated work must be opposed to achieve preparedness to cope with flood attacks. Some cadres are not good at combining several tasks, believing that making wheat levies prevents them from engaging in flood control, and engaging in flood control prevents them from doing other work. Due to this isolated working method, coupled with the actual difficulties of few cadres and many tasks, some flood control headquarters are nominal and flood control work is extremely superficial. Some cadres seriously neglect prior organizational preparations, believing that when a real flood comes, there will be people if people are needed, and materials if materials are needed, and the problem will be solved. There is no need to panic now that the flood has not yet arrived. This lack of preparation in advance and the inevitable confusion when a large flood arrives is a paralyzing thought due to insufficient understanding of the characteristics of the Yellow River and should be corrected immediately. In addition, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the masses, inspect the teams, repair dangers and loopholes, strengthen engineering strength, seriously inspect tools and materials to ensure that they are complete, repair flood control huts, strengthen close contact between superiors and subordinates, strengthen anti-special work, and prevent rumors and disruption of transportation, so as to cope with the arrival of large floods and create conditions to ensure that the dikes do not break.

	Strict Rewards and Punishments, Implement Performance Appraisal System, Launch Labor Emulation to Overcome Floods

Fourth, strict rewards and punishments, implementing a performance appraisal system, and launching labor emulation are important conditions for overcoming floods. Therefore, in flood control work, those who have contributed to dike protection and rescue should be rewarded, and those who are ineffective in flood control should be punished, in order to ensure vigorous morale. At the same time, it is necessary to achieve mutual support, launch a large-scale emulation of protecting homes and preventing disasters, and fight to safely overcome the flood season and defeat the floods.

The instructions finally require all regions to conscientiously study and implement the above points in order to completely defeat the floods.

### 黄河防汛总指挥部指示各地  进一步加强防汛工作

　　黄河防汛总指挥部指示各地  进一步加强防汛工作
    【本报开封讯】黄河防汛总指挥部袁隆报道：黄河防汛工作经过初步检查后，黄河防汛总指挥部顷又发出进一步加强防汛工作的指示。指示中首先指出：目前正在雨季，洪水有时刻到来的可能，迅速做好防汛的一切准备工作，是保证堤不溃决的关键。
    指示叙述目前黄河防汛工作进展的情形称：自中央及各省防汛会议后，经过各级干部的努力，在七月上旬各省、县、区均分别召集了干部会议、代表会议、防汛会议，建立了各级防汛指挥部，缜密地进行了研究与布置工作。尤其是黄河防汛总指挥部成立后，各省在中共党委、人民政府负责同志的亲身领导下，分别进行了堤防检查，发现不少隐患及堤线坝埽强度不够的弱点，现正进行补救工作。经过动员与选拔的长期防汛员，已经开赴堤线。干部及部分群众，基本上是动起来了。这个时期的主要经验是：召开防汛代表会议，布置防汛工作，端正干部思想，通过乡村各种组织，进行深入动员，是发动群众的重要环节。
    指示继即强调指出，目前各地虽已作出了成绩，但还存在着如下问题，急待解决：
    扭转麻痹思想克服命令主义把防汛工作深入到群众中去
    第一、必须把防汛工作深入到群众中去。根据各方材料，目前防汛工作基本上还停留在区、村干部中，广大的群众还没有全面发动起来，干部和群众中还有许多思想问题没有解决。濮县与鄄城以下虽然较好，但由于以往几年都没开口，大家认为现在堤坝加强了，存在“不要紧”的思想。山东群众说：“从来没有见过这样好的坝工”、“咱这里不会开口，如果大水，上面早就出乱子啦！”河南群众则说：“我们这里几十年没上滩了，干部们你放心吧，大水真的靠堤，俺们都是杨家将，孩子老婆一齐上。”同时对于以上思想问题，有的干部由于对黄河特点不清楚，说服不了群众，到修防段要办法。有的就采用强迫命令办法，向群众宣布“几日组织好”“某日要晾兵”，甚至说“今年大水，那里开口，杀那里头”。结果这种作法是失败的。但也有些干部采取了通过各种组织，以访问座谈，举出被灾实例的方法，启发了群众思想，使群众自觉的积极行动起来。凡走这样道路的县段都是成功的。部分干部的命令主义，必须严格批判。
    认真进行普遍检查彻底消灭堤身隐患
    第二、消灭堤身隐患是不容再缓的工作，必须认真的迅速的采取有效方法去进行。据初步了解，许多水沟浪窝没有修补，就是修补了的，有的是把沟两边的土向里一松，加上点新土，没有行夯，结果无济于事。更严重的是河南及平原坝头以上大堤，隐患甚多，经初步检查，即发现獾狐洞达一千二百九十八个；并且有的坝埽强度不够，料物不齐，部分堤线不够应修标准，如遇洪水考验，势必招致灾祸。因此，必须认真的迅速的遵照中央指示进行普遍的大检查，在最短时间内为彻底消灭堤身隐患而努力。
    反对临阵磨枪和单打一现象做到有备无患保证堤不溃决
    第三、必须迅速完成一切准备工作，反对临阵磨枪和单打一的工作作风，做到有备无患以应付洪水袭击。在干部中存在着不善于将几种工作结合进行，认为作麦征就不能搞防汛，搞防汛则不能做其他工作。由于这种单打一的工作方式，再加上干部少任务多的实际困难，有的防汛指挥部是有名无实，防汛工作极不深入。还有部分干部严重忽视事先的组织准备工作，认为真的大水来了，要人有人，要料有料，问题就解决了，现在大水未来，还不用慌。这样事先不准备，大水到来必然手忙脚乱，这是对黄河特点认识不足的一种麻痹思想，应当立即纠正；此外，必须深入的发动群众，检查队伍，修补险象和漏洞，加强工程强度，认真的点验工具料物达到齐全，修好防汛屋庵，密切上下级联系，加强防特工作，防止造谣及破坏交通，以应大水的到来，为保证堤不溃决而创造条件。
    奖惩严明推行考绩制度开展劳动竞赛战胜洪水
    第四、奖惩严明，推行考绩制度，开展劳动竞赛，这是战胜洪水的重要条件之一。因之在防汛工作中，对护堤抢堵有功者奖，防汛不力者罚，借以保证旺盛的情绪；同时要做到互相支援，开展保家防灾劳动的大竞赛，为安度大汛战胜洪水而斗争。
    指示最后要求各地，切实认真研究与执行上述各点，以期彻底战胜洪水。
