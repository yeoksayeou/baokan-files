　　Xinhua News Agency, London, August 22nd: Reuters London, August 21st: British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt issued a statement regarding the British government's announcement that British troops are being dispatched from Hong Kong to Korea, stating: "The British government, in obedience to MacArthur's order to immediately send troops to Korea, once again demonstrates its servile willingness to sacrifice the lives and interests of the British people in order to carry out the American financial magnates' heinous aggressive plans. Despite the fact that the American imperialists are massacring peaceful Korean residents, carrying out large-scale terror bombings, and other atrocities, they are still suffering repeated defeats at the hands of the heroic Korean people. Therefore, American imperialism insists on British ground forces helping them in their futile effort to conquer and enslave the Korean people."

    The statement pointed out: The further involvement of British troops in the American war of aggression against Korea is also related to MacArthur's aggression against Taiwan and opposition to the People's Republic of China.

    The statement concluded by calling on all peace-loving people in Britain to respond to this news with a powerful wave of protest.

    "Not a single man for MacArthur's war!"

    "Stop sacrificing British lives!"

    "No interference in Korea! No interference in Taiwan!"

　　英政府顺从美国命令自港派军赴朝
    波立特抗议英国参加侵朝战争
    并号召英国人民反对干涉朝鲜和台湾
    【新华社二十二日讯】电通社伦敦二十一日讯：英国共产党总书记波立特就英政府宣布英军正自香港开赴朝鲜一事发表声明称：“英政府顺从麦克阿瑟所下立即派兵赴朝鲜的命令，从而再一次地表现了它不惜牺牲英国人的生命和利益以奉行美国大财阀的罪恶侵略计划的一副奴才相。尽管美帝国主义者在屠杀朝鲜和平居民，进行了大规模的恐怖轰炸及其他种种暴行，但是，它仍然在英勇的朝鲜人民面前节节败退。因此，美帝国主义坚持要英国地面部队去帮助他们，从事征服并奴役朝鲜人民的徒劳无功的努力。”
    声明指出：英军这次进一步参与美国侵略朝鲜的战争，也是与麦克阿瑟侵略台湾反对中华人民共和国的行动有关的。
    声明的末尾号召英国一切爱好和平的人士，以强大的抗议浪潮来回答这个消息。
    “不为麦克阿瑟的战争出一个人！”
    “停止牺牲英国人的性命！”
    “不要干涉朝鲜！不要干涉台湾！”
