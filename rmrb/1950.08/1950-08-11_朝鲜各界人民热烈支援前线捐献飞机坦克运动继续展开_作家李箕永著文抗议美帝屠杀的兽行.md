　　【Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th】The movement among people from all walks of life in Korea to donate airplanes and tanks to support the front lines is continuing to unfold. Faculty and staff of Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang held a general meeting on the 2nd and decided to raise funds to purchase "University" airplanes and tanks, and called on all university faculty and staff in North Korea to respond to this movement.

　　The movement launched by women in the northern half of the Republic to donate airplanes and tanks has achieved remarkable results. Women in North Hamgyong Province have donated 4.6 million won in cash and a large amount of gold jewelry. Women in Chengting (transliteration) Township have donated 1.1 million won alone. Fundraising in Geonsan County (transliteration) and Anju County (transliteration) is also underway.

　　Following the conference of Pyongyang Christians, the Cheondoists and Buddhists also convened conferences of believers in Pyongyang on the 6th and 7th respectively, to mobilize support for the Fatherland Liberation War. At the Cheondoist conference, Gao Xinpu, Vice Chairman of the Central Zongwu Academy of Cheondoism, called on believers to support the front lines by donating money, comforting the troops, restoring destruction, and increasing grain production. A donation immediately began at the meeting. The conference also resolved to designate August 13th as "North Korean Cheondoist Believers' Day for Supporting the Front Lines and Praying for Victory in the War."

　　【Xinhua News Agency, 10th】According to TASS, Pyongyang: Korean writer Li Qiyong published an essay in "Labor News" protesting the atrocities of the US imperialists in indiscriminately bombing peaceful people in Korea. Li Qiyong wrote: "Under the pressure of the heroic People's Army, the retreating US ground forces are cruelly carrying out a scorched-earth policy against peaceful residents. As a result of the barbaric acts of the US Army, many densely populated areas south of Suwon have been reduced to ashes." US planes are not only destroying schools, hospitals, people's homes, and cultural institutions, but also brutally massacring groups of children playing happily.

　　Li Qiyong finally called on the Korean people to concentrate their efforts, support the front lines, and actively participate in the struggle against the US aggressors.

    作家李箕永著文抗议美帝屠杀的兽行
    【新华社平壤十日电】朝鲜各界人民捐献飞机、坦克支援前线的运动，正在继续展开中。平壤的金日成大学教职员，曾于二日召开全体大会，决定筹款购买“大学号”飞机、坦克，并号召北朝鲜全体大学教职员响应这一运动。
    共和国北半部妇女展开的捐献飞机、坦克的运动，已获得显著成绩。咸镜北道的妇女已捐献了四百六十万元现款和大量金饰。成亭（译音）镇妇女已单独献出了一百十万元。根山县（译音）和安州县（译音）的募捐工作也在进行中。
    继平壤基督教徒召开大会之后，天道教与佛教亦于六、七两日先后在平壤召开教徒大会，进行支援祖国解放战争的动员。在天道教教徒大会上，天道教中央宗务院副委员长高信甫号召教徒以献金、劳军、恢复破坏与增产粮食来支援前线，会上随即开始了献金。大会并决议定八月十三日为“北朝鲜天道教教徒支援前线与祷告战争胜利日”。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜作家李箕永在“劳动新闻”上发表论文，抗议美帝国主义者在朝鲜滥肆轰炸和平人民的兽行。李箕永写道：“在英勇的人民军的压力之下，撤退中的美国地面部队正在残酷地对和平居民进行斩尽杀绝的工作。由于美国陆军野蛮行为的结果，在水原以南很多人烟稠密的地方都变成一片灰尽。”美国飞机不仅毁灭学校、医院、人民住宅和文化机关，还残暴地屠杀愉快地游戏着的成群的儿童。
    李箕永最后号召朝鲜人民集中力量，支援前线，积极参加反对美国侵略者的斗争。
