Regarding Criticism of Wang Baode's Opinion to This Newspaper
    Comrade Zhou Wenlong's Self-Criticism
    Editor's Note: On July 18th, this newspaper's mailbox answered the question, "Is it in accordance with organizational discipline for a Communist Party member to offer criticism and suggestions to the Party newspaper regarding the work of the government?" Comrade Zhou Wenlong, the head of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, who was mentioned in this answer, has now written to offer his self-criticism regarding his original views on this matter. Comrade Zhou Wenlong's opinions and attitude in this letter are completely correct. Comrade Zhou Wenlong's letter is published as follows:
    To the Editorial Department of the People's Daily:
    I believe that the opinion expressed in the People's Mailbox on July 18th in response to Comrade Wang Baode's complaint is correct, and my criticism of Comrade Wang Baode was basically inappropriate. This is because, after reading Comrade Wang Baode's original letter, which was forwarded by the General Office of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, I had the following one-sided understandings:
    First, I originally believed that the opinions raised by Wang Baode had already been appropriately resolved in a special meeting prior to his writing the letter (and he was also aware of these solutions). Therefore, I thought he should not have submitted his opinions to the Party newspaper again. However, I did not consider that Wang Baode's opinions had the benefit of urging an early resolution of the issue.
    Second, I originally believed that, based on the full text of Wang Baode's opinion (the People's Daily only published an abstract of Wang Baode's letter, not the full text), there were some inaccuracies. However, I failed to realize that preventing him from submitting his opinion to the Party newspaper was restricting Wang Baode's due rights; as for the inappropriate aspects of his opinion, he should be responsible for those himself. Most importantly, I overlooked the correct aspects of Comrade Wang Baode's opinion.
    Third, I mechanically implemented the general regulations regarding military-government relations, namely that when there are differing opinions between the military and the government, the military side should primarily conduct more self-criticism and blame themselves more. Therefore, I also one-sidedly emphasized that the issue raised by Comrade Wang Baode should be resolved internally within the military. I did not understand that his raising the issue in this way was still beneficial to resolving the problem within the military.
    Fourth, I thought at the time that Comrade Wang Baode was a cadre Party member and also a member of the Party Committee of their unit, not an ordinary Party member. Therefore, writing to the Party newspaper should have been approved by their Party Committee. But in fact, not only ordinary Communist Party members have the democratic right to write to the Party newspaper, but cadre Party members also have this right.
    The main reason for this inappropriate criticism was that I did not understand the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" sufficiently. I should better study the Party's instructions and grasp the Party's policies in the future in order to improve myself and work for the Party better and more cautiously. Is this appropriate? Please criticize.
　　With Respects,        Zhou Wenlong, August 12th

　　为批评王宝德向本报提意见事
    周文龙同志自我检讨
    编者按：七月十八日本报信箱曾答复了“共产党员向党报提出对政府工作的批评和建议，是否合于组织纪律？”这样一个问题。这个答复所曾提到的华北军区后勤部长周文龙同志，现在来信检讨了他在这一问题上原来的看法。周文龙同志在这封信里的意见和态度是完全正确的。兹将周文龙同志来信发表如次：
    人民日报编辑部：
    七月十八日人民信箱答复王宝德同志的申诉的意见，我认为是正确的，我给王宝德同志的批评基本上是不适当的。这是因为我当时接读由政务院财经委员会办公室抄转的王宝德同志的原信后，发生有以下的片面的认识：
    第一，我原来认为：王宝德所提的意见，已经在他写这一信以前的专门会议上作了适当的解决（他也知道这些解决办法），因此，我认为他不应当再向党报提意见。可是我没有想到，王宝德的意见有催促问题早日解决的好处。
    第二，我原来认为：王宝德的意见就其全文看（人民日报只将王宝德信摘要发表，未发表他的全文），其中有不符事实的地方，但我没有了解到，因此阻止他向党报提意见，是限制了王宝德应有的权利；至于他的意见有些不妥的地方，则是应由他本人负责。最重要的是忽视了王宝德同志正确方面的意见。
    第三，机械地执行了关于军政关系中一般的规定，即凡遇着军队与政府之间有不同意见时，主要应该由军队方面自己多作检讨，多责备自己。因而对于王宝德同志所提问题，也片面地强调应由部队内部自己来解决。我没有了解他这样提出意见，仍有利于在部队内部解决问题的好处。
    第四，我当时以为王宝德同志是干部党员，同时是他们单位党委会党委之一，不是一个普通党员，因此向党报写信应该经过他们党委的同意。但事实上不仅普通共产党员，有向党报写信的民主权利，而且干部党员同样有这种权利。
    产生这次不适当的批评的原因，主要是我对党中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定”的了解不够。我以后应更好地学习党的指示和掌握党的政策，以提高自己，更好地与谨慎地为党工作。当否？请予批评。
　　致以敬礼        周文龙  八月十二日
