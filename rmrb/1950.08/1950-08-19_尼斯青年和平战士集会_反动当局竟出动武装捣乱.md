Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 17th: The youth peace relay race continues towards Nice. Thousands of young men and women are traveling by train from Paris and other French cities to Nice, preparing to participate in the Youth Peace Warrior Assembly. The authorities have gathered a large number of "Republican Security Forces" in Nice to deal with the youth's peaceful gathering.

At the same time, fascists have unscrupulously launched acts of terror and sabotage, and the police have not interfered at all. On the night of the 10th, unidentified armed personnel, traveling in cars, threw grenades at several buildings and bookstores selling democratic books in Nice, and planted explosives under the building of the Communist Municipal Committee. Another group of thugs planted a bomb under the Rex Cinema, where the youth assembly was to be held.

On the 11th, a grand demonstration was held in Nice to protest the harassment by fascists and to demand the lifting of the ban on the meeting of Italian and French youth. The government mobilized a large number of armed police to block the path of the demonstrators, but the demonstrators evaded them and still organized a gathering. Baulerot, Secretary of the Communist Party's Alpes-Maritimes Provincial Committee, spoke at the meeting, denouncing the authorities' deliberate provocations and urging the attendees not to fall into the trap of these provocations.

Similar demonstrations were held in several other cities in the Alpes-Maritimes province. On the 11th, workers in many enterprises in the Nice area held short strikes to protest the local governor's ban on the youth assembly. Various democratic organizations in France have also protested the provocative and destructive actions taking place in the Nice area.

　　尼斯青年和平战士集会
    反动当局竟出动武装捣乱
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：青年和平接力跑继续向尼斯进发中。成千的青年男女们，正从巴黎和法国其他城市乘火车到尼斯去，准备参加青年和平战士大会。当局已在尼斯集结了大批“共和国保安队”，来对付青年们的和平会师。
    与此同时，法西斯分子已肆无忌惮地展开了恐怖破坏活动，警察竟毫不拦阻。十日夜间，有一个身份不明的武装人员，乘坐汽车，向尼斯若干建筑物和出售民主书刊的书店投掷手榴弹，并且在共产党市委会房屋下安置炸药。另一批暴徒则在将在该处举行青年大会的雷克斯电影院房屋底下安置了一枚炸弹。
    十一日，尼斯举行盛大示威游行，抗议法西斯分子的骚扰，并要求取消对于意、法两国青年会师的禁令。政府调集了大批武装警察，阻挡示威群众的进路，但是，示威群众避过他们，仍然组织了集会。共产党阿尔卑斯海滨省省委书记包雷罗在会上演说，痛斥当局蓄意挑衅的行为，敦促会众切勿堕入这些挑衅的诡计中。
    阿尔卑斯海滨省的若干其他城市中，也举行类似的示威游行。十一日，尼斯地方许多企业的工人曾举行短时间的罢工，以抗议地方长官对青年大会的禁令。法国的各种民主组织也纷纷抗议在尼斯地方所进行的挑衅破坏行动。
