Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 13th: The Politburo of the French Communist Party passed a resolution on August 11th opposing the savage US bombing of the peaceful Korean people and exposing and condemning the Pleven government's policy of stepping up war preparations and betraying the nation.

The resolution declares: The bombing and massacre of the elderly, weak, women, and children of Korea by the American aggressors violates the basic principles of humanity and should be opposed by the entire civilized world. The resolution calls on the entire party to redouble its efforts and strengthen the signature campaign for the declaration of peace, bringing it to a new and surging climax.

The Politburo denounced the government's war policy, which plunges the working people into poverty and subjects them to super-exploitation, stating: The Pleven government, on the one hand, is formulating a three-year rearmament plan of 2,000 billion francs, making French military expenditure reach 1,200 billion francs annually due to additional funding; on the other hand, it is preventing wage increases, attempting to give workers only starvation wages. The Politburo is convinced that the working people everywhere will stop this policy with united action.

The Politburo draws the nation's attention to the fact that in its rearmament memorandum, the French government requested the US and Britain to send fully-manned divisions to be stationed in French territory, attempting to rely on the support of the US and British occupation forces to implement its unpopular Pétain-style rule based on oppressing the people and selling out national interests. The French people know very well that no one is threatening our country; the fact is that the United States wants to use us in its planned war against the Soviet Union. Precisely for this reason, the French people are opposing the plan to subject France to occupation again in every way.

The Politburo urges all patriots, participants in the Resistance movement, and all people of goodwill to unite in a united front to fight against the occupation that is being planned and to defend democracy, freedom, and peace.

　　法共政治局决议
    反对美对朝鲜野蛮轰炸
    斥普利文政府出卖民族政策
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：法国共产党政治局于十一日会议中通过决议，反对美国对朝鲜和平人民的野蛮轰炸，并揭露和指斥普利文政府加紧备战和出卖民族的政策。
    决议宣称：美国侵略者对朝鲜老弱妇孺的轰炸屠杀，违背了人道的基本原则，整个文明人类都应该加以反对。决议号召全党加倍努力，加强征集和平宣言的签名运动，使其呈现汹涌澎湃的新高潮。
    政治局斥责政府使劳动人民陷于贫困并遭受超级剥削的战争政策称：普利文政府一面制订二万亿法郎的三年重整军备计划，使法国军费支出由于追加的经费而年达一万二千亿法郎；一面却阻止工资的增加，企图使工人们仅仅得到挨饿的工资。政治局确信，各地劳动人民将以团结一致的行动，制止这一政策。
    政治局唤起全国注意：法国政府在重整军备的备忘录中，要求美英派遣实力充足的师团驻扎法境，企图凭借美英占领军的支持，实施其怨声载道的以压迫人民和出卖国家利益为基础的贝当式的统治。法国人民深知：没有一个人在威胁我们的国家，事实却是美国想在计划中的反对苏联的战争中利用我们。正因为这样，法国人民正以一切方式反对使法国再受占领的计划。
    政治局敦促一切爱国分子、抵抗运动参加者以及一切善良的人民，在联合阵线中一致团结起来，为反对正在策划中的占领，为保卫民主、自由与和平而奋斗。
