Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Youth League members in Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places are uniting broad masses of youth to extensively carry out peace signature campaigns. Youth League members and youth have become an important force in the local peace signature campaign activities.

During the "July 1st" to "July 7th" peace signature campaign promotion week, the Youth League branches in schools, factories, and government offices in Qingdao first conducted thorough ideological mobilization from within the League to outside the League, and then organized the broad masses of youth and children to extensively carry out promotional work. In the Taixi District of the city, 26 Youth League members from 16 primary schools, under the leadership of the Youth League branch, cooperated with school administrative staff and teachers to organize 6,000 children to carry out promotional work, mobilizing over 50,000 farmers in the district to sign the peace declaration. Youth League members from various industries in Qingdao carried out promotional activities in various ways according to the specific circumstances of their respective industries. For example, Sun Zhongshi, a Youth League member who sells water, set up a signature table next to his water-selling stall. One day, he got 120 people to sign in three hours. Youth League members in the Western food industry put the signature book on the dining table, both serving customers and promoting the campaign. Deliverymen from the Salt Industry Company and the Grain Company, as well as household registration police who checked household registrations, carried signature books with them and seized any spare time to carry out promotion.

Students in various schools in Shanghai generally organized publicity groups to go deep into the alleys to carry out publicity, pushing the peace signature campaign to unorganized masses.

Under the promotion of Youth League members, 10,000 youths and children in Changchun participated in the peace signature campaign. The Youth League County Committees in Bin County, Shuangcheng, Acheng, and other places in Songjiang Province, under the unified leadership of the local Committee for the Defense of World Peace, actively carried out publicity work. The Bin County Youth League Committee once organized League members and youths to explain the significance of the peace signature campaign to the masses, and organized 16 Yangge teams to cooperate with the publicity, performing more than 60 short plays.

The Youth League peace signature campaign in Hebei Province has begun to penetrate into the countryside. The Youth League branch of Beipo Primary School in the 9th District of Xingtai County, Hebei Province, mobilized students and the Youth League branch of Beipo Village to cooperate with the publicity, mobilizing all the villagers to sign. After studying the significance of the peace signature campaign, all 65 Youth League members in Zhaicheng Village, Ding County, signed their names and launched a week-long publicity campaign throughout the village, enabling all more than 2,000 farmers in the village to sign.

    【新华社十四日讯】青岛、上海等地新民主主义青年团的团员团结广大青年广泛展开和平签名的宣传活动，各地青年团员和青年成为各地和平签名宣传活动中的重要力量。
    在“七一”到“七七”的和平签名运动宣传周中，青岛市各学校、工厂、机关青年团支部都首先从团内到团外进行了深入的思想动员，然后组织广大青年和少年儿童广泛地展开宣传工作。该市台西区十六个小学中有二十六个青年团员在团支部领导下，配合学校行政工作人员和教师，组织了六千名少年儿童进行宣传工作，动员了全区五万以上的农民在和平宣言上签了名。青岛市的各行业青年团员根据各业的情况，采用多种多样的方式进行宣传活动。如卖水的青年团员孙中史，在卖水桌旁摆着签名桌，某日在三小时内就有一百二十人签名；西餐业的青年团员则把签名簿摆在餐桌上，一面招待客人，一面宣传；盐业公司、粮食公司的送货员和查户口的户籍警察都随时带着签名簿，抓紧空隙时间进行宣传。
    上海市各学校学生普遍组织了宣传小组深入里弄进行宣传，将和平签名运动推进到无组织的群众中去。
    在青年团员的推动之下，长春全市有一万名的青年和少年儿童参加了和平签名运动的宣传工作。松江省宾县、双城、阿城等地青年团县委会都在该地保卫世界和平委员会的统一领导下，积极进行宣传工作。宾县团委会曾组织团员和青年向群众讲解和平签名运动意义，并组织了十六个秧歌队配合宣传，演出短剧六十余次。
    河北省的青年团和平签名宣传活动已经开始深入农村。该省邢台县九区北坡小学的青年团支部发动学生和北坡村青年团支部配合宣传，动员了全村的村民都签了名。定县翟城村六十五个青年团员在学习和平签名运动的意义后，全体签了名；并向全村展开一周的宣传活动，使全村二千余农民全部签了名。
