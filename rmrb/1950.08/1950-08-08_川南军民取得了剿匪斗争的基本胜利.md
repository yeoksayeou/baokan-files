　　The People and Army of Southern Sichuan Achieve a Basic Victory in Suppressing Bandits
　　Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Li Lizhong

　　After half a year of arduous struggle, the Southern Sichuan region has annihilated more than 110,000 bandits. The bandits north of the Yangtze River were cleared out by the end of May, and the bandits in most areas south of the Yangtze River were initially cleared out by the end of June. The great victory in suppressing bandits has ensured the stability of people's lives, consolidated the people's political power, and ensured the basic completion of tasks such as grain requisition, tax collection, and the issuance of public bonds.

　　The concentrated enemies were annihilated, but the dispersed and hidden enemies took up arms again!

　　The People's Liberation Army unit responsible for liberating Southern Sichuan began its mission on December 1st of last year, arriving in Chishui on the border of Sichuan and Guizhou. In just half a month, by the 16th, it had completely liberated Southern Sichuan. The former Kuomintang army's 72nd Army, Hu Zongnan's 27th Army's 91st Regiment, the puppet Zigong City Police Team, and the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's 44th Army's 150th Division revolted under the powerful offensive of our army. The 12 million people in 34 counties and one city in the Southern Sichuan region celebrated their liberation with unparalleled enthusiasm, welcoming the new year of 1950.

　　While the people celebrated their liberation, Kuomintang bandit gang secret agents and Chiang Kai-shek army officers who had escaped capture during the war were colluding with local reactionary landlords and feudal forces, preparing to make a comeback and re-rule the people of Southern Sichuan.

　　January 1950 passed peacefully. Small groups of bandits began to appear in early February. For example, Niezhan Wu, Pan Houkun and other bandits appeared in Luxian. At this time, our Southern Sichuan Military Region troops had just returned from participating in the Chengdu campaign and were not yet familiar with the local situation, so bandit suppression work could not be launched immediately. Secret agents, bandits, and a small number of reactionary landlords and habitual bandits colluded, taking the opportunity to recruit scattered soldiers, hooligans, organize old rural security forces, and coerce good farmers to become bandits; on the other hand, they used methods such as "adding commissions" and "recruiting" to unify the bandit forces. By the end of March and the beginning of April, the total number of bandits in the region (over 100 people) had developed into 91 groups, totaling nearly 60,000 people, and their counter-revolutionary activities spread to every county and city.

　　Bloody Debts

　　Under the instigation of Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang secret agents, large and small groups of bandits frantically attacked the people, destroyed the people's interests, and committed heinous crimes. They undermined every measure of the People's Government, disrupted transportation, and prevented the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. When the bandit's ferocity was at its peak, highways and water transportation were mostly cut off. Bandit secret agents also attacked district and township people's governments, and brutally murdered staff, peasant activists, and the broad masses of the people. According to extremely incomplete statistics from the Southern Sichuan District Committee of the Communist Party of China, more than 400 staff members sacrificed their lives in grain requisition and bandit suppression work this year, and 60 peasant activists were killed in the Jianyang riots manufactured by bandits and special agents alone. As for the bandits and special agents forcing grain and money and demanding people (demanding young men to become bandits), the number of farmers who were brutally killed or tortured because they could not hand them over is impossible to count. In the Wang family in Datianba, Hengjiang District, Yibin, six of the seven family members were killed, and the only child who survived escaped by hiding under the bed. In the Hengjiang area, bandits and special agents also carried out extremely brutal massacres. According to preliminary statistics, more than 300 progressive people and people were brutally killed during the period when the bandits occupied the area (before June). According to incomplete statistics from the Southern Sichuan Trading Company, the company's stolen materials (including cloth, salt, rice, RMB, etc.) amounted to 680 million RMB. The robbery of the people is too numerous to describe. Throughout the area, except for those close to cities or major transportation routes where people's troops were stationed, the people were mostly subjected to bandit robbery and extortion. Some areas were robbed several times. When bandits attacked Baihua Field and Wang Field in Yibin, in addition to being looted, 70 to 80 percent of the houses were burned down. In some areas, the bandits coerced the masses to take baskets and other items with them to rob. On the one hand, this was used to strengthen their momentum, and on the other hand, it created contradictions among the farmers, and used this to lure and force the masses to become bandits. In many places, the masses were unable to live and produce because their grain and materials were robbed by bandits, resulting in a serious famine. For example, in Yingping Township, Bilo Township, and Suguang Township in the fifth district of Nanxi, the amount of abandoned land reached 50 percent due to bandit robbery and harassment. In addition, bandits and special agents also systematically spread various rumors, spread disappointment, and provoked relations between the army and the people.

　　This is Chiang Kai-shek's predetermined plan

　　How did the bandits arise?

　　According to the confession of Luo Guoxi, the former "Commissioner" of the 7th District of Sichuan and a Kuomintang secret agent, the Kuomintang reactionaries had long planned so-called "guerrilla areas" in Sichuan and deployed a large number of secret agents and bandits to operate. The bandit gang had two planned areas in Southern Sichuan: one area centered on Gao (County), Gong (County), Qing (Fu), Chang (Ning), Xing (Wen), and Yun (Lian), with Kong Xuefan in charge. The other area was based in Luxian, with Luo Guoxi in charge. According to Du Jinsheng, secretary of the Kuomintang secret agent Luo Guoxi, the Kuomintang reactionary government sent Luo Guoxi as the "Commissioner" of the Seventh District in May 1949, and Chang Yizhong, Zhang Shuliang, and Kong Xuefan as the "County Magistrates" of Gu Song, Gu Lin, and Xingwen counties in August, with the main purpose of preparing for "guerrilla warfare" after the liberation of Sichuan. After Luo Fei arrived in the Seventh District, he made many preparations: (1) The Gulou Mountain and Dali Village in Luxian were used as "guerrilla bases," and Fu Jian and Xiao Zhennan were specially assigned to be responsible for building fortresses in the two places, clearing households, and hoarding grain in preparation for counter-revolution. (2) The 7th District's puppet security police brigade (five squadrons, more than 400 people) was expanded into a general team (three battalions, twelve squadrons, more than 1,700 people) as the backbone of the "guerrilla" armed forces. (3) Secret service organizations were established in various counties. Each county's "Self-Defense General Team" established intelligence groups, and hand-cranked radios were placed in each county. (4) Conducted training for the county's puppet "Self-Defense Model Team Members," a total of two sessions, training more than 6,000 people. And selected elite men and guns from the puppet self-defense brigades in various townships to form "model squadrons" as the basis for developing "guerrilla" armed forces. (5) Ordered each county to select suitable locations as "bases," such as Longchang taking Yunxiangzhai as a base, and Gu Lin taking the mountainous areas of Guihua and Dunzi townships as bases.

　　The Kuomintang bandit gang also systematically ran so-called "Guerrilla Cadre Training Classes," training about 3,000 people in Chengdu in five sessions. In addition to the above open organizations, Kuomintang secret agents also systematically deployed so-called "latent organizations" in the Southwest. According to Luo Guoxi's confession, Lu Shikun, the Kuomintang secret agent in charge of Chengdu, had planned a series of activities to harm the people with Mao Renfeng, the head of the Kuomintang secret service.

　　According to Huang Long, the repentant bandit leader of Guandu Township, Luxian Seventh District: Before liberation, the Kuomintang County Party Department ordered him to pull together a "guerrilla team." At the beginning of the liberation of Southern Sichuan, Huang twice convened meetings of landlords and upper-class members of the township to collude and organize a "guerrilla team." Most of the reactionary landlords in the township directly became bandits, and some did not become bandits on the surface, but actually supported the bandits with guns and grain. Most of the township chiefs became bandits and organized each security police team (more than ten to twenty guns) to rebel and become bandits.

　　The Heroic Struggle of the People and Army of Southern Sichuan

　　In order to protect the interests of the people and consolidate the people's political power, the People's Liberation Army Southern Sichuan Military Region troops, after several months of long-distance marching and chasing and annihilating the enemy, did not rest for a day after the Chengdu campaign and plunged into the battle to suppress bandits. For a full six months they have been living in battle.

　　The troops encountered many difficulties at the beginning of the bandit suppression. On the one hand, the troops had just arrived in Southern Sichuan, were unfamiliar with the terrain and situation, had no contact with the people, and could not grasp the bandit situation. On the other hand, some cadres developed the idea of ​​wanting to engage in national defense forces and not wanting to be localized; cadres and soldiers generally had a contempt for bandits, thinking that Chiang Kai-shek's millions of regular troops had been annihilated, so what was so great about a few small bandits! In terms of tactical guidance, it was still the same set of regular operations, so they often missed during the advance. In late March, the Southern Sichuan District Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of senior cadres in the region (cadres above the regimental level of the troops participated), criticized the erroneous thinking of the troop cadres, established the idea of ​​resolutely localizing, building Southern Sichuan for a long time, and implementing the party's unified leadership and tactical transformation.

　　After the March meeting, the troops changed from fighting large battles and regular battles to "annihilating the enemy by using flexible tactics according to different situations" in tactics. For example, if the bandits gathered at night and dispersed during the day, we would enter the battle at night, and if they gathered during the day and dispersed at night, we would enter the battle during the day. Appropriately concentrate forces, focus on the attack, and then purify the surface. At the same time, strengthen small troop activities and plainclothes activities. For large groups of enemies, concentrate forces to fight hard and chase fiercely until they are completely annihilated.

　　At the same time, the troops worked on the masses, disintegrated the enemy, and made "the combat team also a work team." Every time they arrived in a place, after a large number of enemies were annihilated or defeated, the troops dispersed to do mass work, publicizing our policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding meritorious service," striving for the coerced to surrender and reform. Some combined grain requisition and organized mass joint defense and self-defense. In many areas, because the bandits spread rumors and intimidated the masses, the masses fled one after another when our bandit suppression troops arrived. Our troops carried out arduous mass work, first universally helping the masses with labor - carrying water, planting rice, repairing houses, etc. After the masses fled, our troops properly guarded the things in their homes. Secondly, they convened meetings of the elderly who remained at home, explaining the difference between our army and the Kuomintang bandit army, exposing rumors, and the masses quickly returned to their hometowns.

　　In the bandit suppression, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army showed unparalleled bravery, tenacity, and hard work. Many touching stories spread among the masses. Ninety percent of the troops fought barefoot in bandit suppression, but they still chased the bandits day and night without rest. Southern Sichuan is a rainy area, and the troops often suppressed bandits in the rain; a certain unit of the Leshan Military Sub-district climbed Aoshan, which is 3,000 meters high, when suppressing bandits in Emei. Another unit suppressed bandits in southwestern Qianwei and often had to climb snowy mountains (covered with snow all year round) to pursue and annihilate the enemy. A certain unit of the Yibin Military Sub-district suppressed bandits in Fuxingchang, Pingshan, chasing them for two days and nights, and finally completely annihilated the enemy. Because the troops were dispersed to suppress bandits, it was difficult to maintain regular contact with their superiors. Some troops did not receive food money for three months, so they did not eat vegetables or ate rice with salt water. Two platoons of the third battalion of a certain regiment were surrounded by more than a thousand bandits in Nan Shang Luo Chang, Gong County. They bravely persisted for three days, killing more than 40 bandits, until the arrival of the responding troops. They only suffered four casualties.

　　At the same time, the work teams of the People's Government not only did mass work, but also provided the troops with information. Most of the work teams were equipped with certain weapons and assisted the troops in suppressing bandits at any time, performing the task of "the work team is also a combat team." Under the implementation of unified leadership, "Bandit Suppression Committees" were generally established in various places after March, with responsible comrades from the Party, government, and army, and absorbing local enlightened people to participate, unifying the leadership of bandit suppression and grain requisition work. The use of enlightened people to disintegrate bandits under our military strikes also played a certain role.

　　After the March meeting, local armed forces were generally established in various places - county battalions and district squadrons. These troops were drawn from the main force, and the proportion of veteran soldiers was higher than that of the main force (because the main force was easier to manage when concentrated). This enabled the local armed forces to cooperate organically with the main force. The local armed forces were stationed for a long time to support the government's work, while the main force could concentrate more and mobilize to annihilate the enemy. In the annihilation of 59,990 enemies in June, the county and district grassroots armed forces annihilated 15,149 enemies.

　　In the past six months, the military region and military sub-districts have vigorously transformed the uprising armed forces and rural security armed forces through movements such as speaking out about grievances, and have achieved great results. In the past six months, a total of 31,000 old armed forces have been transformed, and 15,500 old armed forces officers (above platoon level) have been trained.

　　The public security departments of the People's Government played an active role in cooperating with the troops to eliminate bandits and special agents. In the past six months, 41 special agent conspiracy riots have been uncovered in the region; 164 bandit and special agent cases have been uncovered, involving 1,388 people; 58 intelligence cases have been uncovered, involving 99 people; in addition, there have been many cases of sabotage of finance, assassination, and spreading rumors. A total of three radio stations, six passwords, and a lot of guns and ammunition were seized.

　　After half a year of work, the masses have had a preliminary mobilization. Mass joint defense and self-defense organizations have been initially established in the counties north of the Yangtze River. These mass joint defense and self-defense organizations have played a certain role in cooperating with the troops in suppressing bandits and requisitioning grain. For example, when encountering bandit harassment, they would beat gongs and drums to respond to each other. The masses also universally launched work to disintegrate bandits, such as explaining the lenient policy, persuading family members of bandits, and calling their husbands and sons back, which played a big role. Some areas have already established farmers' associations. According to statistics from Neijiang Prefecture in June, the number of organized masses in the region has reached 300,000 (mainly farmers' associations and joint defense and self-defense teams). Some of the joint defense and self-defense teams under the control of the farmers' associations have seized illegal weapons from bandits and reactionary landlords and handed them over to reliable farmers.

　　The Southwest Military and Political Committee's rent reduction regulations and the Central People's Government's land reform law have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers to fight. They are preparing their strength to realize "rent reduction this year and land reform next year."

　　Strive for Greater Victories on the Basis of Victory!

　　According to statistics from the Southern Sichuan Military Region, the people and army of Southern Sichuan have annihilated a total of 113,698 bandits in the six months of bandit suppression, including 7,681 bandits killed, 7,622 bandits wounded, 41,061 bandits captured, and 57,334 who surrendered and reformed. The above-mentioned enemy annihilation figures include 76 bandit leaders above the bandit "army," "division," "commander," and "regimental commander" levels. A total of 12 mortars, 28 60mm mortars, 30 heavy machine guns, 86 carbines, 277 submachine guns, 40,717 rifles and horses, 3,054 short guns, and 1,919 indigenous guns and cannons were seized. By the end of May, all the bandits north of the Yangtze River had been cleared, and by the end of June, bandits in groups of more than ten people had also been cleared. Traffic on highways and waterways throughout the region has been restored. In June, the bandits in Muchuan, Mabian, and Pingshan south of the Yangtze River were also basically cleared; Qingfu, Gongxian, and north of Changning were basically purified, and north of Xuyong and Gu Song was basically opened. According to estimates by the Southern Sichuan Military Region, the remaining bandits who fled to the border areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan are estimated to total more than 13,000 people (not including scattered bandits). The day to completely annihilate the bandits on the basis of the current victory should not be far away.

　　川南军民取得了剿匪斗争的基本胜利
    本报特约记者  李力众
    经过半年来的艰苦斗争，川南地区共歼匪十一万多人，长江以北地区股匪五月底已肃清，江南大部地区的股匪六月底也初步肃清。由于剿匪的伟大胜利，保障了人民生活的安定，巩固了人民政权，保障了征粮、税收、公债发行等任务的基本完成。
          　集中的敌人被歼灭了，分散隐蔽的敌人又拿起了武器！
    担负解放川南任务的人民解放军某部，从去年十二月一日抵川黔边之赤水起，到十六日仅半月时间即全部解放川南。原国民党军七十二军、胡匪宗南二十七军九十一团、伪自贡市警察队、蒋匪四十四军一五○师残部，在我军强大攻势震慑下举行起义。川南全区三十四个县一个市的一千二百万人民，以无比热情，欢庆自己的解放，迎接新的一九五○年。
    与人民欢庆解放的同时，国民党匪帮的特务分子，在战争中侥幸漏网的蒋匪军官，却在勾结地方反动地主、封建势力，准备东山再起，重新统治川南人民。
    一九五○年一月平静的度过了。二月初就开始出现了小股土匪活动。如泸县出现了乜占吾、潘厚坤等股匪活动。这时正是我川南军区部队参加成都战役返回不久，对于地方情况还极不熟悉，剿匪工作一时不能展开。特务、土匪与少数反动地主惯匪勾结，乘机一方面收罗散兵游勇，地痞流氓，组织旧乡保武装，胁迫善良农民充当土匪；一方面用“加委”、“收编”等办法统一土匪力量。到三月底四月初，全区土匪（百人以上）已发展成九十一股，约近六万人，其反革命活动遍及每一县市。
          　血债累累
    在蒋匪帮特务分子指使下，大小股匪疯狂向人民进攻，破坏人民利益，造成滔天罪恶。他们破坏人民政府的每一项措施，破坏交通，阻止城乡物资交流。土匪凶焰较盛时，公路、水上交通大都被截断。土匪特务并进攻区、乡人民政府，残杀工作人员、农民积极分子与广大人民。根据中共川南区党委极不完全统计，本年来在征粮剿匪工作中牺牲的工作人员在四百人以上，农民积极分子被杀者，仅在匪特制造下的简阳暴动中即有六十人。至于匪特区逼粮逼款、要人（要壮丁当土匪），农民无法缴出而遭惨杀或拷打者无法统计。宜宾横江区大田坝一家王姓的居民，全家七口被杀六口，剩下一个小孩是躲在床下脱身的。在横江地区，土匪特务还实行了极其残暴的大屠杀。据初步统计，在土匪盘据时期（六月以前），被残杀的进步人士与人民达三百余人。根据川南贸易公司的不完整的统计，该公司被抢物资（包括布、盐、米、人民币等）达六亿八千万人民币。对于人民的抢劫则多得无法叙述。全区除靠近城市、或交通要道有人民军队驻防者外，人民大都遭受过土匪抢劫、勒索。某些地区则被抢数次。宜宾白花场、王场被土匪攻入时，除遭洗劫外，房屋被烧毁百分之七十到八十。某些地区，土匪则胁迫群众拿着箩筐等随其外出抢劫。一方面借此壮大声势，另一方面又制造了农民之间的矛盾，并借此引诱、逼迫群众为匪。许多地方的群众因粮食、资材被匪抢光而无法生活，无法生产，形成了严重的灾荒。如南溪五区英平乡、碧罗乡、宿广乡因土匪抢掠滋扰，荒田达百分之五十。此外，匪特并有计划的散布各种谣言，散布失望情绪，挑拨军民关系。
          　这是蒋匪预定的计划
    土匪是怎样产生的？
    根据原四川伪第七区“专员”，军统特务分子罗国熙的供认，国民党反动分子在四川老早就计划了所谓“游击区”，布置了大批特务匪徒的活动。匪帮在川南预定计划有两个地区，一区以高（县）珙（县）庆（符）长（宁）兴（文）筠（连）为中心，派孔匪学繁负责。另一区以泸县为根据地，由罗匪国熙负责。据军统特务罗国熙秘书杜今生供称，国民党反动政府于一九四九年五月派罗国熙为七区“专员”，八月派常宜中、张树良、孔学繁为古宋、古蔺、兴文三县“县长”，其主要目的在于准备四川解放后的“游击战争”。罗匪到七区后作了许多准备工作：（一）以泸县之鼓楼山、大里村两处作“游击根据地”，并派傅健、萧镇南专门负责修建两地城寨，清查户口，囤积粮食作反革命准备。（二）将七区伪保警大队（五个中队四百余人）扩为总队（三个大队十二个中队一千七百余人），作为“游击”武装的基干。（三）在各县设立特务组织。各县“自卫总队”设立情报分组，并在各县配置手摇电台。（四）办理各县伪“自卫模范队员”集训，共办了两期，训练六千余人。并在各乡镇伪自卫大队中选拔精锐人枪成立“模范中队”。作为发展“游击”武装的基础。（五）命各县选择适当地点作“根据地”，如隆昌以云项寨为根据地，古蔺以桂花、墩梓两乡山区为根据地。
    国民党匪帮还有计划的举办了所谓“游干班”，在成都先后共训练五期约三千余人。除以上公开组织外，军统特务还在西南有计划的布置了所谓“潜伏组织”。据罗匪国熙供称，军统特务成都负责人吕世锟曾与国民党特务头子毛人凤计划了一系列的残害人民的勾当。
    另据泸县七区官渡乡自新土匪头子黄龙供认：解放前国民党县党部曾布置其拉“游击队”。川南解放之初，黄曾两次召集该乡地主、上层分子开会共同勾结组织“游击队”。该乡反动地主大部直接当了土匪，部分表面未当土匪，而实际以枪、粮支持土匪。该乡保长大部当了土匪，并组织每保警备队（十余到二十余人枪）叛变为匪。
          　川南军民的英勇斗争
    为了保卫人民利益，巩固人民政权，人民解放军川南军区部队经过几个月的长途急行军、追歼敌人，于成都战役后，没有休息一天，就投入了剿匪的战斗。整整半年他们一直在战斗中生活。
    剿匪开始时部队曾碰到许多困难。一方面部队刚到川南，地形、情况不熟，与人民没有联系，对匪情无法掌握。另一方面在某些干部中产生了愿搞国防军不愿地方化的思想；干部战士中普遍存在轻视土匪思想，认为蒋匪几百万正规军都被歼了，几个小土匪有什么了不得！在战术指导上，仍然是正规作战的一套，因此进剿中常常扑空。三月下旬，中共川南区党委召开了全区高干会议（部队团以上干部参加），批判了部队干部的错误思想，树立了坚决地方化，常期建设川南，贯彻党的一元化的领导及战术转变的思想。
    三月会议后，部队在战术上由打大仗，打正规仗，转变为“根据不同情况，运用灵活战术，歼灭敌人”。如土匪夜聚明散，我即夜间进剿，明聚夜散我即白天进剿。适当集中力量，有重点的进剿，然后到面的净化。同时加强小部队活动，便衣活动。对大股敌人，集中兵力穷打，猛追，直到全部歼灭。
    同时，部队一面作战，一面发动群众，瓦解敌人，作到了“战斗队又是工作队”。每到一地，在大股敌人被歼灭或击溃后，部队即分散作群众工作，宣传我“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”政策，争取胁从分子自首、自新。有的则结合征粮，组织群众联防自卫。有许多地区由于土匪造谣、恐吓群众，我剿匪部队一到，群众纷纷逃走，我部队即进行艰苦的群众工作，首先普遍帮助群众劳动——挑水、插秧、修房子等。群众逃走之后，家中东西我部队即妥为看守。其次召集留在家里的老人开会，讲明我军与国民党匪军的不同，揭破谣言，群众便很快返回家乡。
    在剿匪中，人民解放军指战员表现了无比的英勇顽强，艰苦努力，许多可歌可泣的故事在群众中流传着。百分之九十的部队在剿匪中打赤脚，但仍然日夜不息的追剿土匪。川南是多雨的地区，部队经常淋雨剿匪；乐山军分区某部，在峨眉剿匪时曾爬过三千公尺高的垇山。另部在犍为西南剿匪，常常要爬上雪山（常年积雪）追歼敌人。宜宾军分区某部在屏山复兴场剿匪，连追两昼夜，终于全歼了敌人。由于部队分散剿匪，和上级很难保持经常联系，有的部队三个月没领到菜金，他们就不吃菜或用盐水下饭。某团三营两个排于珙县南上罗场被千余土匪包围，他们英勇的坚持了三天，打死土匪四十余，直到应援部队的到达。他们仅仅伤亡四人。
    同时，人民政府的工作队，不仅作群众工作，而且要供给部队情况，大多数工作队都配带一定武器，随时协助部队剿匪，执行“工作队又是战斗队”的任务。在贯彻一元化领导下，三月以后各地普遍建立了“剿匪委员会”，以党、政府、军队负责同志，吸收地方开明人士参加，统一领导剿匪、征粮工作。在我军事打击下，运用开明人士瓦解土匪也起了一定作用。
    三月会议后，各地又普遍建立了地方武装——县大队、区中队。这些部队都是由主力中抽下来的，其中老战士占的比率比主力还多（因主力集中易于管理）。这样使地方武装与主力能够有机配合，地方武装长期驻剿驻防支持政府工作，而主力则能更集中，机动歼灭敌人。在六月歼敌五万九千九百九十人中，县区基干武装歼敌为一万五千一百四十九人。
    半年来军区、军分区通过诉苦等运动大力进行了对起义武装与乡保武装的改造，收到了巨大成绩，半年改造旧武装共三万一千人，训练旧武装军官（排以上）一万五千五百人。
    在配合部队消灭土匪、特务中，人民政府公安部门，起了积极的作用。半年来全区破获特务阴谋暴动案四十一起；破获匪特案件一百六十四起，人数一千三百八十八人；破获情报案五十八起，人数九十九人；此外还有破坏金融、暗杀、造谣等案件多起。共缴获电台三部、密码六件，及很多枪弹。
    经过半年的工作，群众已经有了初步的发动。群众性联防自卫组织，在长江以北的各县已初步建立。这些群众性联防自卫组织，在配合部队剿匪、征粮，起了一定作用。如遇到土匪滋扰则鸣锣击鼓互相应援。群众并普遍展开瓦解土匪工作，如讲明宽大政策，说服匪属，叫丈夫、儿子回来，发挥了很大作用。有些地区已经建立农民协会，据内江专区六月统计，全区有组织群众已达三十万人（主要为农协，联防自卫队）。在农协掌握下的联防自卫队，有的已经收缴土匪、反动地主的非法武器，掌握在可靠的农民手中。
    西南军政委员会的减租条例，中央人民政府的土地改革法的公布，大大鼓舞了农民的斗争积极性，他们正在准备力量，实现“今年减租，明年土改”。
          　在胜利基础上争取更大的胜利！
    根据川南军区的统计，川南军民半年的剿匪斗争，共歼匪十一万三千六百九十八人，内毙匪七千六百八十一人，伤匪七千六百二十二人，俘匪四万一千零六十一人，投诚、自新五万七千三百三十四人。在以上歼敌数字中包括土匪“军”“师”“司令”“团长”以上匪首七十六名。总计缴获迫击炮十二门、六○炮二十八门，重机枪三十挺，卡宾八十六支，冲锋枪二百七十七支，步马枪四万零七百一十七支，短枪三千零五十四支，土枪土炮一千九百一十九支，枪榴筒二、掷弹筒一。五月底江北地区股匪全部肃清，六月底十人以上股匪亦被清除，全区公路河道交通已经恢复。六月长江以南沐川及马边、屏山股匪也基本肃清；庆符、珙县、长宁以北基本净化，叙永、古宋以北基本打开。根据川南军区估计，窜至川黔、川云康边境的残余股匪，总数约为一万三千余人（零星散匪不在内），在现在的胜利基础上，彻底歼灭股匪的日子当不在远。
