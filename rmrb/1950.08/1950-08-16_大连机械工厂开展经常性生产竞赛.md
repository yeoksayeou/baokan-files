　　【Dalian News】According to the Lüda People’s Daily, the Dalian Machinery Factory's trade union has examined the shortcomings of past production competitions and began launching a regular, comprehensive production competition in August. The factory's past production competitions were mostly short-term and crash campaigns. While these campaigns achieved considerable results, the gains made during the campaigns could not be consolidated and improved upon afterward. The new record movement launched by the factory's Second Workers' Representative Conference this spring, because of the implementation of a piece-rate wage system at the time, led workers to pursue quantity over quality, resulting in a high number of defective products. According to January statistics, copper casting rejects accounted for 16%, iron casting rejects accounted for 5.76%, steel casting rejects accounted for 2.2%, and 24 out of 152 electrode rods broke. Therefore, the competition slogan at the time was: "Increase quantity on the basis of improving quality." After the launch of this movement, some achievements were made, especially in improving quality. According to February statistics, the copper casting reject rate had been reduced to 10.2%, the iron casting reject rate had been reduced to 2.2%, and steel casting and electrode rods had completely eliminated rejects. However, due to the crash nature of the movement and the leadership's shift from strict to lax, the achieved product quality records were not maintained. For example, the iron casting reject rate had been reduced to 0.8% in March, but increased to 2.2% in May; the steel casting reject rate, which had been eliminated in February, reappeared at 1.7% in April; and the number of broken electrode rods, which had been eliminated in February, reappeared at 31 in April. Because of the intermittent nature of the competition movement, the product quantity fluctuated greatly. In the leadership of the production competition by trade union cadres themselves, there was also a tendency to be unable to persevere and to neglect consolidating the achieved results. There was an excessive emphasis on cultivating typical examples without consolidating and promoting them. For example, the Liu Jia-hui group in the machine shop was designated as a typical example group when the movement was launched (because the group produced a particularly large number of defective products in January, accounting for one-third of the total defective products in the shop). At that time, cadres were sent to the Liu Jia-hui group to help find problems, encourage everyone to review the phenomena of irresponsibility towards production, and everyone made their own plans to reduce defective products, and mobilized everyone to challenge each other in the competition. As a result, the group did not produce a single defective product in March and April. Later, trade union cadres believed that the group had no more problems and did not study how to consolidate the achievements of this typical group or promote its experience. Unexpectedly, the group produced defective products again in May and June. For example, in February and March, in order to encourage everyone to improve product quality, a defective product exhibition was organized, in which defective products caused by carelessness in various workshops (sections) were brought to the exhibition, with cartoons, explanations, and the names of the responsible persons attached. This stimulated everyone's attention to defective products and powerfully promoted the movement. Currently, the factory's trade union, having learned from the above lessons, has first determined the nature of the competition as regular and comprehensive in this production competition plan, emphasizing that the competition movement should be combined with regular production tasks. Production tasks are arranged quarterly, and the movement should also be advanced quarterly; production is summarized quarterly, and the competition should also be evaluated and awarded quarterly. The competition conditions include not only production quantity and quality, but also safety, labor protection and hygiene, and labor discipline. At the same time, it emphasizes that honorary rewards must be combined with material rewards, correcting the past tendency to neglect material rewards.

### 大连机械工厂开展经常性生产竞赛

　　大连机械工厂开展经常性生产竞赛
    【大连讯】据旅大人民日报消息：大连机械工厂工会检查了过去生产竞赛中的缺点，于八月份开始发动经常性的全面生产竞赛运动。该厂过去发动的各次生产竞赛，多半是短期的，突击性的。在运动中，曾收得不少成绩，但运动过后，就不能巩固和提高运动中所获得的成绩。如今春该厂通过二届职工代表大会所掀起的新纪录运动，在当时因为实行计件工资制，工人只求数量不管质量，而使废品很多，据一月份的统计：铸铜废品占百分之十六，铸铁废品占百分之五点七六，铸钢废品占百分之二点二，电极棒在一百五十二根中烧断了廿四根，所以当时提出的竞赛口号是：“在提高质量的基础上提高数量”。这一运动开展后，收到了些成绩，特别是提高质量方面更为显著。据二月份统计，铸铜废品率已降低至百分之十点二，铸铁废品率已降低至百分之二点二，铸钢与电极棒则全部消灭废品。但是后来由于运动的突击性及领导上先紧后松，所以使已达到的产品质量纪录没有保持下去。如铸铁废品率在三月份已降低到百分之零点八，但五月份却又增加到百分之二点二；铸钢废品率二月份本已消灭，而四月份又出了百分之一点七；电极棒的烧断量，也由二月份的消灭，四月份又烧断了三十一根。因为竞赛运动的断续，产品数量形成忽多忽少。在工会干部本身领导生产竞赛上，也存在着不能坚持的偏向，忽视巩固既得的成绩。过分强调培养典型，而没有巩固与推广典型。如机械场刘家惠小组，当运动开展后，曾确定为培养典型小组的对象（因该组在一月份出的废品特别多，占全场废品的三分之一）。当时曾派干部深入到刘家惠这一小组，帮助找毛病，启发大家检讨对生产不负责的现象，每人都做出了自己减少废品的计划，并动员大家互相挑起竞赛。结果该组在三四两个月没出一点废品。后来工会干部认为该组已没有什么问题，就没有再去研究如何巩固这一典型小组的成绩，或推广其经验。不料在五六月份该组又出现了废品。又如在二三月间，为了启发大家提高产品质量，曾组织了一期废品展览会，将各场（科）因工作不细心而产生的废品，都搬来展览，并附有漫画、说明及本人名字，这样就剌激了大家对废品的重视，有力的推动了运动。目前该厂工会，接受了以上的教训，在这次生产竞赛计划中，首先确定了竞赛的性质为经常性、全面性的，强调竞赛运动要与经常的生产任务结合。生产任务按季布置，运动也要按季推进；生产按季总结，竞赛也要按季评议发奖。竞赛条件除包括生产上的产量质量外，并把安全、劳保卫生、劳动纪律等也包括在内。同时强调了名誉奖励必须与物质奖励相结合，纠正过去忽视物质奖励的偏向。
