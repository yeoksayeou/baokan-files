Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The National Financial Industry Joint Conference, which opened in Beijing on August 1st, concluded successfully on the 10th after lasting ten days.  Attending and participating in the conference were 103 representatives and experts from various aspects of the financial industry, including the People's Bank of China, public-private joint banks, private banks and native banks, trade unions, and federations of industry and commerce from major administrative regions across the country and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin.  Under the premise of uniting the forces of public and private finance and jointly supporting production, the conference discussed in detail the adjustment of the relationship between the financial industry and industry and commerce, the adjustment of the public-private relationship within the financial industry, and the adjustment of labor-management relations, so that the financial industry could adapt to the needs of national economic construction.

The conference believed that the central task of the financial industry is to support industry and commerce, to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy. Private banks and native banks should strengthen their service spirit and establish extensive contacts with industry and commerce, changing the past generalized relationships based solely on profitability to determine lending decisions. They should establish in-depth connections with loan enterprises, understand their financial plans to provide appropriate assistance, and supervise their production to ensure the fixed purpose of the loan. At the same time, the financial industry should adapt to the profits of industry and commerce and the supply and demand of market funds, gradually lower interest rates, and narrow interest rate spreads. Currently, the connections between the financial industry and industry and commerce are neither in-depth nor widespread, so the contact range with industrial and commercial households needs to be expanded. The conference pointed out that a good condition for private finance to strive for development is the stability of currency and the restoration of credit. Since liberation, especially after currency stabilization and the flow of money to rural areas, the gradual increase in deposits in private financial institutions is a clear example.

The conference believed that the private financial industry must conscientiously carry out rectification and transformation to adapt to new needs. Before the Anti-Japanese War, due to the reactionary government's inducement with high-interest public bonds speculation and imperialism's enticement with the exorbitant profits of concession land, the financial industry developed independently in a situation where industry and commerce were generally declining. Since the Anti-Japanese War, inflation has lasted for twelve years, deepening the suffering of the people. Just as industry and commerce were extremely difficult, forming a situation where "industry is inferior to commerce, commerce is inferior to hoarding, hoarding is inferior to gold, and gold is inferior to foreign exchange," the financial industry lost its normal business ties with industry and commerce, and instead deepened its ties with speculative elements and even speculators in industry and commerce. This has resulted in the false prosperity of banks and native banks, the expansion of institutions, the increase in personnel, and the increasing expansion of expenses. However, the strength of banks and native banks has been substantially weakened day by day. The deposit value once dropped to one two hundred and fiftieth of the pre-war. Therefore, after currency stability, the problem of surplus private bank and native bank institutions in large cities was exposed, and a large number of bankruptcies occurred. Many banks and native banks suffered losses and deficits due to their weak financial strength. The conference believed that private banks and native banks must completely abandon their past profiteering business ideas and the business methods adapted to the period of inflation, conscientiously rectify their organizations, develop their businesses, streamline and economize, and change their style.

The conference enthusiastically discussed the adjustment of the public-private relationship in the financial industry. The conference believed that the development of China's financial industry is still not adapted to the development of the entire social economy. From an overall perspective and from the perspective of development, both public and private financial forces need to seek common development on the basis of supporting production. The conference pointed out that a correct public-private financial relationship should be established in the process of jointly supporting industry and commerce. The existence and development of the private financial industry is not only permitted, but as long as its development direction is to support industry and commerce, the state bank can also provide necessary support. The conference focused on discussing the development of national remittance business and the issues of transfer deposits and transfer mortgages. The state bank agreed to assist private banks and native banks in terms of capital allocation to develop remittances, facilitate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and retain transfer deposits, which can alleviate the difficulties of banks and native banks in times of credit stagnation. At the same time, the state bank plans to immediately open transfer mortgages, so that private banks and native banks can reduce their worries in the process of supporting industry and commerce. The adjustment of the public-private financial relationship is carried out under the major premise that private banks and native banks themselves work hard to transform and actively support industry and commerce. Private banks and native banks should be self-reliant. Only under this circumstance can the state bank provide necessary support and assistance to private banks and native banks in accordance with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Based on the above common understanding and spirit, the conference studied item by item issues such as deposits, loans, remittances, interest rates, bills, entrusted agency business, institutions, and joint lending, joint operations, mergers, and investment companies. The conference believed that private joint operations and mergers are good forms for private banks and native banks to further concentrate their forces, consolidate credit, promote transformation, expand their ability to support productivity, and overcome current difficulties; and investment companies are an organizational form that further combines finance and production, and both should be supported and promoted. The conference also discussed the management measures for the banking industry.

　　全国金融业联席会议闭幕
    明确公私金融业任务为共同扶助生产
    要求私营金融业切实进行整顿与改造
    【新华社二十三日讯】八月一日在北京开幕的全国金融业联席会议，历时十日，已于十日圆满闭幕。出席和列席这次会议的有全国各大行政区和北京、天津两市的中国人民银行、公私合营银行、私营银行钱庄、职工、工商联合会等各方面的代表以及专家共一百零三人。会议在团结公私金融业力量、共同扶持生产的前提下，详细研讨了调整金融业与工商业的关系、调整金融业的公私关系、以及调整劳资关系等问题，使金融业能适应国家经济建设的需要。
    会议认为，金融业的中心任务为扶助工商业，以达到发展生产、繁荣经济的目的。私营行庄应加强服务精神，与工商业建立广泛联系，改变过去单纯从赢利出发来决定取舍收放的泛泛关系，建立深入贷款企业、了解其财务计划，以便予以适当扶助，监督其生产，以保证贷款用途的固定的业务联系。同时，金融业应适应工商业的利润及市场资金供求情况，逐渐降低利率，缩小利差。目前金融业与工商业的联系既未深入，又不普遍，因此对工商业户的联系面尚待扩大。会议指出，私营金融业争取发展另一良好条件是通货的稳定，信用的恢复。解放以来，尤其是通货稳定、货币下乡后，私营金融业存款逐渐增加就是一个明显的例证。
    会议认为，私营金融业必须切实进行整顿与改造，方足以适应新的需要。在抗日战争以前，由于反动政府以高利公债投机相诱，帝国主义以租界地皮的暴利相诱，金融业在工商业一般凋敝的情况下，独自得到了发展。抗日战争以来，通货膨胀绵延十二年，人民困苦加深，正当工商业极其困难，形成“工不如商、商不如囤、囤不如金、金不如汇”的情况，金融业更失却了与工商业的正常的经营的联系，而密切了对工商业中投机成份甚至于对投机商的联系。因之造成了行庄的虚假繁荣，机构扩张，人员日增，开支日益庞大。但行庄的力量实质上却日益削弱，存款数值一度降至战前二百五十分之一。因此在通货稳定后，大城市中私营行庄机构过剩的毛病便暴露出来，发生了大批的倒闭现象。不少行庄因实力薄弱，发生亏损与赤字。会议认为，私营行庄今后必须完全抛弃过去获取暴利的经营思想和适应于通货膨胀时期的经营方式，切实整顿组织，开展业务，精简节约，改变作风。
    会议热烈地讨论了金融业中公私关系的调整问题。会议认为，中国金融业的发展，还不能适应整个社会经济的发展。从全面来看，从发展来看，公私金融力量都需要在扶持生产的基础上求共同发展。会议指出，正确的公私金融关系要在共同扶植工商业的过程中建立。私营金融业的存在与发展不但是允许的，而且只要其发展方向是扶植工商业的，国家银行还可予以必要的支持。会议着重讨论了开展全国汇兑业务及转存款、转抵押等问题。国家银行同意在资金调拨方面协助私营行庄，以开展汇兑，便利城乡物资交流，保留转存款，在信用迟滞时期，可以以转存款方式，减轻行庄困难。同时，国家银行拟即开办转抵押，使私营行庄在扶植工商业过程中减除后顾之忧。公私金融关系的调整，是在私营行庄本身努力改造并积极扶植工商业的大前提之下进行的。私营行庄应自力更生。只有在这种情形下，国家银行才能根据人民政协共同纲领，对私营行庄予以必要的支持与帮助。
    会议根据上述的共同认识与精神，逐项研究了存款、放款、汇兑、利率、票据、委托代理业务、机构以及联放、联营、合并与投资公司等问题。会议认为私营联营与合并是私营行庄进一步集中力量、巩固信用、促进改造、扩大扶持生产力的实力与克服目前困难的良好形式；而投资公司更是使金融业进一步和生产结合的组织形式，均应赞助推广。会议并讨论了关于银钱业的管理办法。
