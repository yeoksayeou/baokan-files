　　Powerful Strength
    Soviet Union  Guliya
    A handful of despicable traitors, harboring rabid malice towards humanity, are attempting to terrify people with a global massacre. American imperialists, under the banner of the United Nations, are carrying out a bloody invasion against the peace-loving Korean people. The warmongers know that the flames of war ignited in any corner of the earth threaten all people. Therefore, this small group of imperialists seizes every opportunity to ignite global fires.
    However, the strong will of all righteous people in the world, led by the great Soviet Union, obstructs the path to war.
  The Soviet People Detest Wars of Aggression
    The Soviet Union's profound love of peace is forever the reliable bulwark of peace and security for all nations. The Soviet Union's power is forever a bastion of peace, a guardian of the goodwill of all people, and an inspiring example for all warriors striving for peace. Stalin's peace policy is forever the solid foundation in the struggle for peace and the prosperity of all nations.
    We, the Soviet people, detest wars of aggression. Lenin and Stalin taught us this. We, creative people constructing a new, happy life, naturally desire peace. Our loyalty to the cause of peace is deeply rooted. This loyalty stems from our ardent belief in the righteousness of our cause—the cause of Lenin and Stalin—from our commitment to the happiness of all working humanity, and from our sense of responsibility for the fate of world peace.
    The entire Soviet people unanimously signed the Stockholm Appeal. With this, they once again expressed to all humanity their love of peace and their firm will to cooperate with all nations. The Soviet people have thus made an invaluable contribution to the cause of peace. The Soviet people have also presented to peace their unity, their goodwill, and their concern for the happiness of simple people in every corner of the earth. The workers of the whole world know that when they are with the Soviet Union, no enemy of humanity can make them afraid.
    Our signature collection campaign is proceeding with tremendous enthusiasm. It marks a new struggle for labor achievements. People in factories are beginning to guard peace. The struggle for peace has emerged as a nationwide movement.
    The workers of Moscow and Leningrad, the workers of the Urals and Baku, Donbas and Tbilisi, Zaporozhye and Tashkent, the workers of our entire motherland, all glorify peace with their labor. Together with them are all the farmers and intellectuals of the Soviet Union. The entire Soviet people say in unison to war: No!
    I once went to the Stalin Metallurgical Plant in Leningrad. Here, as everywhere else, the Soviet people signed the declaration to express their faith in the motherland, the Party, and Stalin. The entire factory has become a camp for warriors guarding peace. This is the unique passion, the unique voice of patriots taking the same steps as the entire socialist motherland.
    This factory faithfully served the motherland during the war. In peacetime, it equally faithfully fulfills its noble duties…
  Labor is our Banner, the Goal is—Peace
    When talking about the Patriotic War, when the entire country was defending Leningrad, people remember the blacksmith Alexei Liangbaofu. He is a Stalin Prize winner. This man is short but famous for his ability and glorious achievements. When the steel was still being refined in the hot furnace, the blacksmith spoke. In every one of his words, like any Soviet patriot concerned about the fate of humanity, was filled with a deep faith in simple people striving for peace.
    "We know what war is," Liangbaofu said, while slightly opening the furnace door to check the degree to which the steel was refined, "therefore, we know the happiness of peace better than others!"
    This short man is unusually focused on his work. He wants to serve the motherland better. One should save metal and time, one should reduce the cost of parts, one should refine steel faster, and produce more products.
    "What am I doing?" Liangbaofu said, pointing to the finished parts. "Nothing special, just saving metal. The weight of these parts is lighter than expected. Maybe, we need to struggle for a centimeter. Then how many centimeters will the whole country save in a day, a month, a year!"
    "Maybe dozens of tons..."
    "More than that! Hundreds, thousands of tons!"
    At the same time, when I saw the sparks bursting under the steam hammer illuminating the blacksmith's face, I couldn't help but think of the millions of people working for the glory of the motherland and the peace of the world. These people, good people who love labor, make labor their banner, and the goal is—peace!
    Or take a look at the milling worker Alexander Baoluodulin. A man with honest features on a humble face, he has worked in the factory for twenty years. There are deep wrinkles on the bridge of his nose, and his eyes are sharp, accustomed to highly accurate work—whenever it is necessary to determine a few hundredths of a millimeter. Baoluodulin is a participant in the Soviet Peace Congress...
    During the noon break, young people—newly graduated from vocational schools—gathered around him. Baoluodulin surveyed these young workers with sharp eyes. He spoke in a low voice, weighing his sentences:
    "American warmongers have started a bloody conspiracy in Korea. But life tells us that imperialist aggressors will always be destroyed."
    "Yes!"
    Baoluodulin continued:
    "I think: If all the people on earth declare 'No!', then the imperialists must think carefully before they throw themselves into the furnace of world war. That's what I think. If the imperialists unleash a third world war, then this war will be the grave of world capitalism. We all signed the appeal against the atomic warmongers. This is an extremely important thing. The voice of the people—is a great thing, especially the voice of the Soviet people."
    The small mechanical workshop where Baoluodulin works is conducting Stakhanovite-style peace defense. This means that all the workers in the workshop must work in the Stakhanovite style, dedicating their labor to the cause of world peace.
  Soviet Workers Dedicate Their Labor to the Cause of World Peace
    The idea of guarding peace is generated in the broadest masses of the people, and it merges deeply and organically with all the ideas of the Soviet people. This illustrates the Soviet people's great and clear purposefulness, and the Soviet people are educated by the Party of Lenin and Stalin with a spirit of serving the cause of peace infinitely.
    The products produced by this factory serve to further improve the happiness of our people—producing water turbines and steam turbines. The more light, the more beautiful life is. This is why the Weinogradov work team made this obligation to guard peace. The obligation is: to finish the mechanical assembly work five days ahead of schedule, to speed up the production of turbines... For example, Viktor Lichavsky completed three days of work in one day and night.
    "Viktor," the old technician Vasily Balagurov said to him, "you are tired, go and rest."
    But Viktor did not stop working until dawn, when he had completely assembled the distribution grid on the joystick. When the sun rose and shone through the high windows into the workshop, Lichavsky stood next to the inspected electrical grid without the slightest defect...
    The workers in the water turbine workshop, like one person, signed the Stockholm Declaration. The workshop bulletin, published not long ago, wrote in the conclusion of the editorial:
    "Let the American imperialists remember: What the people do not want will never succeed. We—support peace! We—oppose war!"
    When the turner Weniamin Gulchenko read these lines, he nodded admiringly and said:
    "Well said, we—are against the warmongers!"
    After signing the Stockholm Declaration, Gulchenko gathered his workmates. There were old workers who had worked in the factory for decades, and there were also new people from vocational schools. Gulchenko talked to them about peace.
    "We signed the declaration,"—he said, "This is a great thing. Millions of people in the Soviet Union have signed! We fully support Stalin's foreign policy! What is our task, how do I understand it? I think we should work more and better, give the country more turbines, and let the electric light shine faster across every corner of our socialist country."
    Gulchenko wants to complete the turbine parts, which were originally scheduled to be completed in five hundred hours, in two hundred hours.
    One of the best engraving marker workers—Alexei Dmitriev, decided to guarantee the completion of marking the machine being manufactured ahead of schedule. He dedicated his labor to the great and sacred cause of fighting for peace.
  Forever Following the First Warrior for Peace—the Great Stalin
    Nikolai Sergeyev, a mechanical worker who has worked in the factory for thirty-five years, personally experienced the war against Japan, the First and Second World Wars. Who can understand the value of peaceful days like him? Who can fully estimate the happiness that peace brings to mankind like him? He stood bareheaded in front of the workers in his workshop and swore to fight for peace. The old worker's words resounded victoriously throughout the high-ceilinged workshop:
    "I swear to forever follow the first warrior for peace—the great Stalin! I swear to consolidate the power of our beloved motherland! I swear to devote all my strength to the cause of fighting for peace! It is they, the imperialists, who need war, but we, the workers of the whole world, need peace. Peace must defeat war..."
    No matter where you are, no matter which Soviet person you talk to, you can see the genuine, master-like concern for world peace. The Soviet people cannot be separated from the fate of other nations.
    Not long ago, I was in Estonia. I saw hundreds of thousands of people applaud a large choir of thirty-five thousand people. This choir is a song about peace, praising our leader—the great inspirer of the struggle for peace.
    Berd Kelbabayev, a Turkmen writer, told me how the Turkmens conquered the wasteland. This is a wonderful story about our workers.
    "Can Turkmens, like all Soviet people, not fight for peace?" He asked, but immediately replied: "We need peace, because peace makes our land more beautiful!"
    We talked until dawn. At dawn, when the streets of Moscow were quiet for a while, the young Georgian poet Malkini read us a moving poem about a mother fighting for peace. He wrote these verses all night long. He felt happy because these verses were successful...
    All our thoughts revolve around peace, justice, and the prosperity of our motherland.
  The Fighting Task of Workers All Over the World is to Stop the Bloody Hands of the US and British Warmongers
    Many things depend on the Soviet people, who are leading the strong movement for peace. Defending world peace—is the cause of all nations. This is the reason why the best people in the world are concerned about the world war prepared by the American atomic warmongers. The cause of peace cannot wait, it requires not only good intentions, but also action... Stop the bloody hands of the warmongers in Washington and London!—This is the fighting task of workers all over the world. In the struggle for peace and happiness, mankind can boldly rely on the great Soviet Union, rely on its love of peace, and rely on its power…
    …I remembered the courtyard in the Leningrad factory. In a prominent place, next to the tall wall, there is a monument, made of marble. Inscribed on it in gold are the names of some of the workers in the factory who sacrificed under enemy fire. These names evoke the sympathy of all mankind, they seem to be saying: "Remember us when you oppose new warmongers!..." I would like to quote the words of a worker in the factory, these words were said at a workshop conference: "We will always remember you, the victims of war, the glorious children of the motherland. At the same time, when we remember you, and pay great respect to you, we want to say: No more war! But if cannibals start a war, then we will do everything possible to make it the last war in the world."
    A simple Soviet person said this…
    “The simple people of the world are loyal to the cause of peace, and all the despicable plans of modern vicious beasts will be shattered when they encounter this force. All nations are full of determination to build and consolidate this most beautiful house—a spacious house enough to accommodate peace-loving mankind. Peace must defeat war." (Jun Qiang translated from the August 4th Pravda)

　　强大的力量
    苏联  古里阿
    对人类怀着狂暴的恶意的一撮卑鄙叛徒，企图以世界性的屠杀来恐吓人民。美帝国主义者在联合国的旗帜下，正向爱好和平的朝鲜人民实行血腥的进军。战争贩子们知道，大地上任何一个角落里所燃起的战火，就会成为对全体人民的威胁。于是，这一小群帝国主义者们就要利用任何机会来煽起世界的烽火了。
    但是，世界上以伟大苏联为首的一切正直的人们的坚强意志，阻碍着走向战争的道路。
  苏维埃人们憎恨侵略的战争
    苏联的深爱和平永远是各族人民的和平与安全的可靠堡垒。苏联的威力永远是和平的堡垒，是一切人们善良意志的保卫，是一切争取和平的战士的鼓舞范例。斯大林的和平政策永远是争取和平及争取各族人民的繁荣的斗争中的牢固基础。
    我们，苏维埃人们，憎恨侵略的战争。列宁和斯大林曾以此教育我们。我们，富于创造性的、建设着新的幸福生活的人们，自然是希望和平的。我们对和平事业的忠诚，是根深蒂固的。这种忠诚产生自我们对我们的事业——列宁、斯大林的事业——的热烈信赖的正义性，产生自我们致力于全体劳动人类的幸福的力量，产生自我们对争取世界和平的命运的责任感。
    全体苏联人民一致地在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。他们以此再一次地向全人类表示出自己的爱好和平，表示出和各族人民共同合作的坚强意志。苏联人民以此给和平事业带来了无可评价的供献。苏联人民又向和平呈现出自己的团结一致，自己的善良意志，以及对地球上各角落里纯朴的人们的幸福的关切。全世界的劳动者们知道，当他们和苏联在一起时，任何人类的敌人都不能使他们惧怕。
    我们的征集签名运动，是在巨大的高潮中进行的。它标志出争取劳动成就的新斗争。工厂中的人们开始警卫和平。争取和平的斗争已涌现为全民的运动了。
    莫斯科和列宁格勒的工人们，乌拉尔和巴库、顿巴斯和特比利斯，杂波罗什和塔什干的工人们，我们整个祖国的工人们，都以自己的劳动来颂赞和平。和他们一起的还有苏联的全体农民与知识分子。全体苏联人民齐声向战争说：不要！
    我曾到列宁格勒的斯大林冶金工厂去。这儿，和各处一样，苏联人在宣言上签了名，以表示自己对祖国、对党和斯大林的信赖。整个工厂成为警卫和平的战士的军营了。这是和社会主义祖国全国取着同一步调的爱国者的唯一的激情，唯一的声息。
    这个工厂在战争期间，曾经忠诚地服务于祖国。在和平时期，它同样忠诚地担负自己高尚的职责……
  劳动是我们的旗帜，目的是——和平
    谈到全国都在保卫列宁格勒的卫国战争期间，人们就会忆起铁匠阿列克赛·梁包夫来。他是斯大林奖金获得人。这个人身材短小但以能力和光荣的事业而著名。当钢还在热炉中炼着的时候，铁匠说话了。在他的每一句话中，像苏维埃任何一个关怀人类命运的爱国者一样，充满了对争取和平的纯朴的人们的深切信赖。
    “我们知道什么是战争，”梁包夫说，同时稍微打开炉门看一下钢炼得到了程度没有，“因此，我们比别人更知道和平的幸福！”
    这个身材不高的人，异常专注于自己的劳动。他想更好地为祖国服务。应该节省金属及时间，应该减低零件的成本，应该把钢炼的更快，使产品出得更多。
    “我做的是什么呢？”梁包夫指着制好的零件说。“没有什么特殊的，只是我在节省金属。这些零件的重量就比预定的轻了些。也许，要进行争取一公分的斗争。那么全国在一天，一月，一年之中将要节省多少的公分呵！”
    “可能有几十吨……”
    “还多些！有几百、几千吨！”
    同时，当看到蒸汽锤下迸发出的火花照耀着铁匠的脸时，我不由得想起了那数百万为了祖国的光荣和世界的和平而劳动着的人们。这些人，爱好劳动的善良的人们，使劳动成为自己的旗帜，而目的是——和平！
    或者看一下削截工亚历山大·包罗杜林吧。一个谦逊的脸上有着率直的特征的人，他在工厂中已工作了二十年了。鼻梁上有深深的皱纹，眼光是尖锐的，习惯于高度准确性的工作——每逢要决定一公厘的百分之几的时候。包罗杜林是苏联拥护和平代表大会的参加者……
    在正午的休息时间，青年们——刚刚从职工学校毕业的——团团围住了他。包罗杜林以锐利的眼光巡视了一下这些青年工人们。他说话的声音不高，斟量着句子：
    “美国战争贩子已开始在朝鲜挑起了血腥的勾当。但是生活告诉我们，帝国主义侵略者永远要被击毁的。”
    “对呀！”
    包罗杜林继续说：
    “我这样想：如果全地球上的人们都声明‘不！’”，那么帝国主义者们在他们投入世界战争的熔炉之前，就必须好好地考虑一下了。我是这样想的。如果帝国主义者们掀起了第三次世界大战，那么这次战争就会成为世界资本主义的坟墓的。我们都在呼吁书上签了名，反对原子武器论者。这是一件异常重要的事情。人民的呼声——是伟大的事情，尤其是苏联人民的呼声。
    包罗杜林所工作的那个细小机械的工作室，进行了斯塔哈诺夫式的保卫和平。这意味着，工作室的全体工人要按照斯塔哈诺夫式地工作，把自己的劳动供献给世界和平的事业。
  苏联工人把自己的劳动供献给世界和平的事业
    警卫和平的思想产生在最广大的人民群众中，而与苏维埃人的一切思想深刻而有机地汇合起来了。这说明了苏联人的伟大而清晰的目的性，苏联人是列宁——斯大林的党以无限地为和平事业服务的精神教育出来的。
    这个工厂所出的产品，是服务于进一步提高我们人民的幸福的——生产水涡轮和蒸汽涡轮。光明愈多，生活就愈美丽。这就是为什么维诺哥拉朵夫工作小队为了警卫和平而订出这项义务的原因。这义务是：提前五天结束机械的组成工作，以加快涡轮的出产……例如，维克多·李柴夫斯基，一昼夜的时间做完了三昼夜的工作。
    “维克多”老技师瓦西里·巴拉古罗夫向他说，“你已累了，去，休息去吧。”
    但是维克多直到清晨，把操纵杆上的配电格完全组成才放下工作。当太阳升起，穿过高高的窗户照到车间中来的时候，李柴夫斯基站在检查过的没有丝毫缺陷的电格子旁边……
    在水涡轮车间中的工人们，像一个人似的在斯德哥尔摩的宣言上签了名。不久以前出版的车间墙报，在社论的结语中这样写道：
    “让美帝国主义者们记住吧：凡是人民所不愿意的事，永远不会成功的。我们——拥护和平！我们——反对战争！”
    旋工维尼阿明·古尔琴科读到这几行时，赞美地点点头说：
    “说得好，我们——是反对战争贩子！”
    在斯德哥尔摩的宣言上签了名之后，古尔琴科召集了工作中的同伴们。这里有在工厂中工作了几十年的老工人，也有新从职工学校来的人。古尔琴科和他们谈谈关于和平的事情。
    “我们在宣言上签了名，”——他说，“这是一件伟大的事情。苏联数百万人都签了名！我们完全赞助斯大林的对外政策！我们的任务是什么呢，我是怎样了解的呢？我想我们应该更多更好地工作，给国家更多的涡轮，使电灯光更快地照遍了我们社会主义国家的各个角落。”
    古尔琴科把预定在五百小时完成的涡轮零件，现在要用二百个小时来完成。
    最好的镌刻标记工人之中的一个——阿列克赛·德米特里耶夫，决定保证提前完成把正在制造的一架机器的标记刻好。他把自己的劳动供献给伟大而神圣的争取和平的事业。
  永远跟随着争取和平的第一位战士——伟大的斯大林
    在工厂中工作了三十五年的尼古拉·塞尔该也夫，一个机械工人，他亲身经历了对日战争，第一次和第二次世界大战。谁还能像他一样懂得和平日子的可贵呢？谁还能像他一样充分估计到和平给人类带来的幸福呢？他光着头，站在本车间的工人面前宣誓为和平而斗争。这个老工人的话胜利地响彻了这高敞的车间：
    “我宣誓永远跟随着争取和平的第一位战士——伟大的斯大林！我宣誓要巩固我们亲爱的祖国的威力！我宣誓把自己的全部力量交付争取和平的斗争事业！需要战争的是他们，帝国主义者们，而我们，全世界的劳动者们，却需要和平。和平一定战胜战争……”
    无论在什么地方，无论你同哪一个苏联人谈话，你都可以看到对世界和平的真正的、主人翁的关切。苏维埃人是不能与其他各族人民的命运隔离开的。
    不久以前，我曾在爱沙尼亚。我看到了十万人鼓掌赞美一个三万五千人参加的大合唱。这个合唱是关于和平的歌，是颂扬我们的领袖——争取和平斗争的伟大鼓舞者的。
    贝尔德·开尔巴巴耶夫，一位土库曼的作家，他告诉我土库曼人怎样征服了荒原。这是关于我们的劳动者的一个奇妙的故事。
    “土库曼人，和全体苏联人一样，能够不为和平而斗争吗？”他问，但随即回答说：“我们需要和平，因为和平使我们的土地变得更加美丽！”
    我们一直谈到黎明。黎明时候，当莫斯科的大街静一会儿的时候，年青的格鲁吉亚的诗人马尔基尼给我们读了一首使人激动的诗，这首诗是写一位为和平而战斗的母亲的。这些诗句，他整整写了一夜。他感到幸福，因为这些诗句是成功的……
    我们的一切思想，都围绕着和平，正义，和我们祖国的富强。
  全世界劳动者战斗的任务是制止美英战贩们血腥的手
    许多的事情，都系于领导着争取和平的坚强运动的苏维埃人。保卫世界和平——是各族人民的事业。这就是从世界上最优秀的人们起，都关怀着美国原子黩武论者所准备的世界战争的原因。和平事业是不能等待的，它所要求的不仅是要有善良的意图，还要求行动……制止华盛顿和伦敦的战争贩子们的血腥的手！——这即是全世界劳动者们的战斗任务。在争取和平与幸福的斗争中，人类可以大胆地信赖伟大的苏联，信赖它的爱好和平，信赖它的威力………
    ………我忆起了列宁格勒工厂中的庭院。在一个显著的地方，高大的墙边，有一个纪念碑，大理石造的。上面用金字刻着该厂中一些工人的姓名，这些工人是在敌人炮火下牺牲的。这些名字唤起了全人类的同情心，它们好像在说：“当你们反对新战争贩子时，记住我们吧！………”我想引用工厂中一个工人的话，这些话是他在车间中大会上说的：“我们永远记着你们，战争的牺牲者，祖国的光荣儿女们。同时，当我们记着你们，向你们致伟大敬意时，我们要说：不要再有战争！但是如果食人的家伙们挑起了战争，那么我们会尽一切力量使它成为世界上最后的一次战争。”
    一个纯朴的苏联人这样说过……
    “世界上纯朴的人们都忠实于和平事业，现代凶恶的野兽们的一切卑鄙计划一碰到这力量就会粉碎的。各族人民都充满了决心要建设要巩固这一所最美丽的房子——足以容下爱好和平的人类的宽敞的房子。和平一定战胜战争。”（君强译自八月四日真理报）
