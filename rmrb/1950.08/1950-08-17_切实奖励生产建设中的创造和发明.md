　　Earnestly Reward Creativity and Inventions in Production and Construction

    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Rewarding Inventions, Technological Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" and the "Provisional Regulations on Guaranteeing Invention Rights and Patent Rights." This is of great significance for promoting our people's economic construction cause. Under the conditions that our people's war of liberation has achieved a basic victory, and various construction undertakings are being restored rapidly with emphasis, the promulgation of this decision and these regulations is very timely and necessary. "Rewarding scientific discoveries and inventions" is a principle stipulated in Article 43 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; at present, all scientific inventions should "serve the construction of industry, agriculture, and national defense" as the primary goal, which is also a principle stipulated in Article 43 of the Common Program. This decision and these regulations of the Government Administration Council implement this spirit.
    In the past, under the extremely difficult conditions of the war period, we relied on the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the people in the liberated areas. We tried every possible means to overcome countless difficulties and defeat the ferocious enemy, just as we did on the production front and other fronts. The current conditions are much better than in the past. As long as we earnestly implement the decision of the Government Administration Council and encourage the "enthusiasm and creativity of workers, technicians, and staff members in all public and private enterprises, as well as all those engaged in scientific and technological research work related to production, so that they can fully utilize their knowledge, experience, and wisdom to devote themselves to inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals," then it is believable that our various production and construction undertakings will definitely make rapid progress.
    The Chinese people are brave, hardworking, and intelligent, and are full of creativity. However, due to the long-term reactionary rule in the past, the rich creativity of the Chinese people not only did not have the opportunity to develop, but was also stifled. Now the situation is completely different. The broad masses of working people, especially the working class, have become the leading class of the country, raised their awareness as masters of their own affairs, and launched rationalization proposal and new record-breaking movements in many enterprises, achieving great results. This is a fundamental change that will inevitably occur on the production front after the victory of the people's great revolution. However, some cadres and staff members in our enterprise management have not fully recognized this qualitative change. They still more or less adopt outdated viewpoints and conservative attitudes, are satisfied with the old production levels and technical levels, and lack a revolutionary and enterprising spirit. They have not given reasonable rewards and due remuneration, especially material rewards and remuneration, for many production-related inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals. They hold negative, non-mass-line views on production competitions and reward systems. This is very wrong and should be corrected quickly. We believe that the administrative heads of all economic departments, the heads of all enterprises and management committees, and the trade unions of all enterprises should, in accordance with the decision of the Government Administration Council, jointly examine and correct the above-mentioned erroneous tendencies. For all production-related inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals, whether collective or individual, that create new production methods or produce new products, etc., should be seriously rewarded and remunerated; in particular, material rewards and remuneration should be given in accordance with the regulations of the Government Administration Council. All possible convenient conditions should be provided for the experimental work of new inventions. Article 5 of the Government Administration Council's decision points out: "Rashly engaging in trial production without careful research and due experimental process, resulting in waste of state property." This is only "a tendency that should be paid attention to in encouraging and assisting the active development of work," and it is not the main tendency that has already occurred widely now. The main tendency now, as pointed out at the beginning of the Government Administration Council's decision, is that "some responsible authorities have failed to pay due attention to this important work, or have failed to give reasonable rewards and remuneration, so that the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, technicians, staff members, and all those engaged in scientific and technological research work for inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals has not been duly encouraged, which is undoubtedly a loss to the country's economic construction cause."
    In order to implement this decision, the Government Administration Council has instructed the Financial and Economic Commission to formulate a number of specific measures. In addition to the reward measures for production-related inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals that will be announced separately, the "Provisional Regulations on Guaranteeing Invention Rights and Patent Rights" have now been issued.
    This set of regulations, like other regulations of the Government Administration Council, is fundamentally different from similar regulations of the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the right to inventions that serve the interests of the country and all the people did not exist and was impossible. The Kuomintang reactionary government could only allow the existence of "patent rights" that served the private interests of a few capitalists. These inventions that were only "patented" were often not closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. At the same time, because it was limited to "patented" inventions, the total number was pitifully small from an overall perspective. According to investigations, the total number of various inventions registered and obtained "patent rights" under the Kuomintang reactionary government before liberation was only more than 600. Such a small number can illustrate its nature of serving the private interests of a few capitalists. The creativity and inventions of the broad masses of people were completely stifled. In contrast, our People's Government represents and guarantees the interests of the vast majority of people. Therefore, the People's Government must first universally guarantee the people's right to invention, give due encouragement and remuneration to all creative inventions that are conducive to production and construction; at the same time, under the condition of not monopolizing and manipulating the economy of the broad masses of people, it also appropriately guarantees private patent rights. The implementation of these regulations will undoubtedly greatly encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to actively create and invent in production and construction, and enable our industrial and agricultural production and national defense and other construction undertakings to be restored and developed more rapidly.

### 切实奖励生产建设中的创造和发明

　　切实奖励生产建设中的创造和发明
    中央人民政府政务院发布《关于奖励有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的决定》和《保障发明权与专利权暂行条例》，这对于促进我国人民的经济建设事业具有十分重大的意义。在我国人民解放战争取得基本胜利，各项建设事业有重点地迅速恢复的条件下，这个决定和条例的颁布是很及时和必要的。《奖励科学的发现和发明》，这是人民政协共同纲领第四十三条所规定的原则；目前一切科学发明，应该“以服务于工业农业和国防的建设”为首要目标，这也是共同纲领第四十三条所规定的原则。这次政务院的决定和条例，就是贯彻着这样的精神。
    过去在战争时期极端困难的条件下，我们曾依靠了解放区人民的革命积极性和创造性，在生产战线上和在其他战线上一样，想尽一切方法，克服了无数的困难，战胜了凶恶的敌人。现在的条件比过去优越得多了。只要我们切实执行政务院的决定，鼓励一切公营私营企业中的“工人、技术人员和职员以及一切从事有关生产的科学与技术研究工作者的积极性与创造性，使能充分发挥其知识、经验与智慧，致力于发明、技术改进及合理化建议的工作”，那末，可以相信，我们的各种生产建设事业就一定会有迅速的进步。
    我国人民是英勇、勤劳而智慧的，是富有创造力的。但是由于过去长期反动统治的结果，使我国人民丰富的创造力不但没有发展的机会，而且被窒塞了。现在情况完全不同了，广大劳动人民，特别是工人阶级，成为国家的领导阶级，提高了主人翁的自觉，在许多企业中，开展了合理化建议和创造新纪录的运动，有了很大的成绩。这是人民大革命胜利之后，在生产战线上必然会发生的根本性质的变化。但是，我们有些企业管理的干部及工作人员，还没有充分认识这是质的变化。他们还或多或少地采取着陈腐的观点和保守的态度，以旧的生产水平和技术水平为满足，缺乏革命的进取的精神。他们对于许多有关生产的发明、技术改进和合理化建议，没有给以合理的奖励和应得的报酬，特别是物质的奖励和报酬。他们对于生产竞赛和奖励制度抱着消极的、非群众路线的观点。这是十分错误的，应该迅速加以纠正。我们认为各经济部门的行政负责人，各企业的主管人和管理委员会，以及各企业的工会，都应该根据政务院的决定，共同检查与纠正上述的错误倾向。对于创造新的生产方法，或产制新的生产品等一切有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议，无论是集体的或个人的，都应该认真地给以奖励和报酬；特别是要按照政务院的规定，给以物质的奖励和报酬。对于新发明的试验工作，应给以一切可能的便利条件。政务院决定第五条指出：“不经过仔细的研究和应有的实验过程而贸然从事试制，以致浪费国家的财物。”这只是“在鼓励、协助工作积极展开的时候，应注意防止的一种偏向”，这还不是现在已经普遍发生的主要的偏向。现在的主要偏向，正如政务院决定开头就指出的，是“有些主管机关对此项重大工作未能予以应有的注意，或未给以合理的奖励和报酬，致使广大工人、技术人员、职员以及一切从事科学技术研究工作者对发明、技术改进及合理化建议的积极性没有得到应有的鼓励，这无疑是国家经济建设事业的损失”。
    为了执行这个决定，政务院责成财政经济委员会制定若干具体办法。除了有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励办法将另行公布以外，现在已经发布了《保障发明权与专利权暂行条例》。
    这一项条例，和政务院其他各种条例一样，与过去国民党反动政府的同类条例也是根本不同的。在国民党反动统治之下，一切为国家和全体人民的利益服务的发明权，是不存在的和不可能的。国民党反动政府只能允许为少数资本家的私利服务的“专利权”的存在。这种只许“专利”的发明，也往往是与国计民生关系不大的。同时，因为只限于“专利”的发明，所以在总的方面来看，数量也少得可怜。据调查，解放前在国民党反动政府登记而取得“专利权”的各种发明的总数仅有六百余件。这样小的数目就可以说明它的为少数资本家的私利服务的性质。广大人民的创造与发明就完全被窒塞了。与此相反，我们人民政府是代表与保障最大多数人民的利益的。因此，人民政府首先要普遍保障人民的发明权，给予一切有利于生产建设的创造发明以应有的鼓励与报酬；同时在不垄断操纵广大人民经济的条件下，也适当地保障私人的专利权。这个条例的实施，无疑的将会极大地鼓励广大人民在生产建设中积极创造与发明的热情，使我国的工业和农业生产及国防等建设事业更迅速地恢复与发展起来。
