　　National Cotton Production Work Conference Summarizes Work
    Great Achievements in Cotton Production Improvement in the Past Six Months
    Estimated Production of Over 14.4 Million Dan of Ginned Cotton This Year, Roughly Meeting the Needs of the National Textile Industry
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 20th] In order to adapt to the new situation of future national industrialization and foreign trade development, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened a National Cotton Production Work Conference from August 8th to 17th. More than 40 representatives from major administrative regions, including the Northeast, North China, East China, Central South, Northwest, and Southwest, attended the meeting.

    The meeting first summarized the cotton production work in the first half of this year. The achievements in improving cotton production nationwide in the past six months have been significant. This year, the nation has planted a total of over 60.25 million mu of cotton (in 1949, the nation only had 38.6 million mu of cotton fields). After deducting some abandoned cotton fields due to disasters such as floods, droughts, insect pests, and hail, where yields cannot be guaranteed, the actual harvest area is over 56 million mu, exceeding the original national cotton planting plan of 50 million mu. Currently, cotton growth in various regions is generally good, except for slight drought in the Northwest. If there are no irresistible disasters, it is estimated that the nation can produce over 14.4 million dan of ginned cotton this year (the planned production of ginned cotton this year is 13 million dan), which, in addition to being used for hand spinning and batting, can roughly meet the needs of the national textile industry.

    The attainment of the above achievements is inseparable from the strong leadership of Party and government leading organs at all levels. At the beginning of cotton planting, the leading organs in many cotton-producing areas listed the cotton planting task as a top priority, organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside, and vigorously carried out publicity and mobilization through newspapers and pamphlets. They also mobilized Communist Party members, New Democratic Youth League members, and model workers to take the lead in promoting the work, completing a series of top-down organization and mobilization efforts. At the same time, the Central People's Government issued a notice on the cotton-grain price ratio and stipulated that cotton could be used to pay public grain, effectively safeguarding the interests of cotton farmers. Leading organs in major administrative regions also promulgated measures to reward cotton planting. In some regions, cooperatives and cotton yarn and cloth companies also signed advance cotton purchase contracts with farmers. These measures effectively eliminated farmers' concerns about cotton planting and greatly increased their enthusiasm for cotton planting. In addition, the support of national financial and material resources also played a significant role. This year, the Central People's Government's cotton investment amounted to over 60 million jin of rice. In addition to being used for the construction of cotton farms and cotton ginning mills, it also purchased a large number of agricultural medicines, machinery, and fertilizers, and regulated a large amount of cotton seeds (a total of over 78 million jin of cotton seeds were organized and regulated across the country), helping cotton farmers solve the seed difficulties during cotton planting.

    There were also some problems and shortcomings in the cotton production work in the past six months. First of all, because the cotton production institutions in various regions did not have sufficient grasp of the local situation and lacked systematic investigation and research, the organizational leadership work for increasing cotton production was not specific and in-depth enough. In many regions, the phenomenon of equally distributing cotton planting tasks occurred. Some regions failed to meet local needs, resulting in some regions lacking seeds while others had a surplus. In the acquisition and regulation of cotton seeds, some regions did not conduct careful enough inspections of the acquisition, storage, and promotion of cotton seeds, resulting in mixed and inferior cotton seeds, even mold and rot, and low germination rates, causing great losses. In addition, the cotton production institutions in major administrative regions and provinces are not yet sound enough, and their work nature and direction are not clear enough. The cotton-grain price ratio standards in some regions are not reasonable enough, and there is no good coordination in the cotton collection work, which also needs to be resolved urgently in the future.

    In response to the above situation, the meeting discussed and resolved issues such as the acquisition of high-quality cotton, the cotton-grain price ratio, the seed selection campaign, cotton production surveys, and the establishment of a high-quality seed breeding and promotion system, stipulated the work tasks for the second half of the year, and initially drafted the three-year cotton production increase plan for 1951-53.

　　全国棉产工作会议总结工作
    半年来棉产改进成就巨大
    估计今年可产皮棉一千四百余万担，大致可满足全国纺织工业需要
    【新华社二十日讯】为了适应今后国家工业化和对外贸易发展的新情况，中央人民政府农业部于八月八日至十七日召开全国棉产工作会议。出席会议的有东北、华北、华东、中南、西北、西南等大行政区代表共四十余人。
    会议首先总结了今年上半年的棉产工作。半年来全国棉产改进工作的成就是巨大的。今年全国共种植棉花六千另二十五万余亩（一九四九年全国只有棉田三千八百六十万亩），除去部分因受水旱虫雹等灾害而产量不敢保证的废弃棉田，实际收花面积在五千六百万亩以上，超过了原定的全国植棉五千万亩的计划。目前各地棉花除西北稍旱外，一般生长良好，如无不可抗拒的灾害，估计全国今年可产皮棉一千四百余万担（今年计划产皮棉一千三百万担），除供手纺和胎絮之用外，可大致满足全国纺织工业的需要。
    以上成绩的获得是与各级党政领导机关的大力领导分不开的。植棉开始时许多产棉区的领导机关将植棉任务列为首要工作，组织大批干部下乡，通过报纸、小册子大力展开宣传动员，并发动中国共产党党员和新民主主义青年团员、劳动模范带头推动，完成了一系列的从上到下的组织动员工作。同时，中央人民政府发布了棉粮比价的通告，并规定棉花可代缴公粮，切实保障了棉农的利益。各大行政区领导机关也颁布了奖励植棉的办法。有的地区的合作社、花纱布公司还预先与农民订立购花合同。这些措施有效地消除了农民对植棉的顾虑，大大提高了农民的植棉情绪。此外，国家财力物力的支持也起了极大的作用，今年中央人民政府支出棉花投资米计达六千余万斤，除了用于建设棉场和轧花厂外，并购买了大批的农用药械、肥料，调剂了大量的棉种（全国各地共有组织地调剂了七千八百余万斤的棉种），帮助棉农解决了种棉时的种籽困难。
    半年来的棉产工作上也存在着一些问题和缺点。首先是因为各地棉产机构对地方情况掌握不够，缺乏系统的调查研究，因此增产棉花的组织领导工作还不够具体深入，有不少地区曾发生平均分配植棉任务的现象，有些地区未能切合当地实际需要，以致发生某些地区种籽缺乏，而另一些地区种籽过剩的现象。在棉种收购与调剂中，有的地区曾发生了对棉种的收购、储存、推广等工作检查不够认真，以致棉种杂劣，甚至霉烂，发芽率低，造成了很大的损失。此外，各大行政区和省的棉产机构还不够健全，工作性质和方针还不够明确。部分地区棉粮比价标准还不够合理，收棉工作中也没有很好的配合，这也是今后急须解决的问题。
    会议针对以上情况，讨论并解决了良棉收购、棉粮比价、选种运动、棉产调查和建立良种繁殖推广制度等问题，规定了下半年的工作任务，并初步拟定一九五一至五三年的三年棉花增产计划。
