Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: An Introduction to the Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 48 (Total Issue 87) has been published.

　　The editorial in this issue is entitled "Do Not Interfere in Korea!" The editorial points out: Hundreds of millions of people around the world are unanimously and firmly expressing their great anger to protest against the aggression of the American and British imperialists in Korea. The editorial says that the Korean incident shows that the plans of the American and British aggressors are being overturned. They had妄想轻而易举地 hoped to easily occupy the entire Korea. The American aggressors obviously have not learned anything from the recent defeat of their running dog Chiang Kai-shek. The heroic Korean people, under the leadership of the national hero Kim Il-sung, are doing everything to defend their unity, freedom and national independence. This is the main reason why the American aggressors' plans are failing. The editorial says that the American imperialists' open acts of aggression in Korea have made the people of the world more aware of the true face of the warmongers. The urgent task of all peace defenders, all well-meaning people and all nations is to step up their opposition to imperialist direct aggression and to fight for the withdrawal of American troops from Korea.

　　Another editorial in this issue is entitled "Recent Actions of the Tito Group in Restoring Capitalism in Yugoslavia." This editorial exposes the Tito group's vile plan to completely restore capitalism in Yugoslavia. The editorial says: Recently, the Yugoslav parliament enacted a law abolishing the decision to nationalize enterprises, and handing over industrial enterprises, railways and mines to so-called "labor collectives" for management. In this way, the Tito group has taken a step towards restoring capitalism in Yugoslavia. The editorial points out that the reasons why the Tito group took these steps are: First, the complete failure of the so-called five-year plan and the organization of "planned economy" that the Tito's leather-clad experts have desperately boasted about; second, the British and American imperialists demanded the restoration of private ownership of the means of production in Yugoslavia in order to restore capitalism. From this, we can also see clearly the class nature of the Tito group. The editorial points out that Tito's trick is nothing new, it is almost no different from the notorious fascist corporatism practiced by Mussolini, it is merely a decoration to cover up its restoration of capitalism.

　　The article "The Goebbels of Yugoslavia Serving the War," written by Chisinevsky, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, exposes the ugly activities of Tito, Djilas, Kardelj and other fascist bandits who imitated Hitler and Goebbels to deceive the Yugoslav people with lies.

　　In addition, the journal published Stalin's second article on linguistics, "Some Questions of Linguistics," and the full text of Chairman Mao's speech on June 28 at the eighth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee refuting the American aggression against Taiwan and Korea.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第四十八期介绍
    【新华社九日讯】《争取持久和平，争取人民民主!》中文版第四十八期（总第八十七期）已经出版。
    本期社论题为：“不要干涉朝鲜！”该社论指出：全世界千百万人民正一致坚决表示他们的极大愤怒，来抗议美、英帝国主义者对朝鲜的侵略。社论说，朝鲜的事变表明：美英侵略者们的计划正在被推翻。他们曾妄想轻而易举地占领整个朝鲜。美国侵略者显然并未从其走狗蒋介石最近的失败中学到一点东西。英勇的朝鲜人民，在民族英雄金日成的领导下，正在全力保卫他们的统一、自由和民族独立。美国侵略者计划垮台的主要原因就在这里。社论说：美帝国主义公开干涉朝鲜的侵略行为，已使全世界人民更认识战争贩子的真面目。一切和平保卫者，一切善意的人们及一切民族的紧急任务在于加紧反对帝国主义的直接侵略及为使美军自朝鲜撤退而斗争。
    本期另一篇社论题为“铁托集团在南斯拉夫恢复资本主义的最近一些作为”。——这篇社论揭露了铁托集团在南斯拉夫完全恢复资本主义的卑污计划。社论说：最近南斯拉夫的国会制定了一个法律，废除将企业收归国有的决定，而把工业企业、铁路和矿山交给所谓“劳动集体”去管理。这样一来，铁托集团就向着在南斯拉夫恢复资本主义前进了一步。社论指出：铁托集团之所以采取这些步骤的原因：第一，是铁托的牛皮专家们所拚命吹嘘的、所谓五年计划和组织“计划经济”的完全失败；第二，是英美帝国主义者要求在南斯拉夫恢复生产资料的私有制，以恢复资本主义。由此也可以看清楚铁托集团的阶级本质是什么。社论指出铁托这个伎俩，并不是什么新东西，它和臭名远扬的墨索里尼所实行过的法西斯组合制几乎没有什么差别，这仅仅是替它恢复资本主义盖上一个妆饰罢了。
    该期登载的罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记齐辛尼夫斯基写的“为战争服务的南斯拉夫的戈培尔们”一文，揭露了铁托、德热拉斯、卡德尔等一群法西斯匪帮们效法希特勒、戈培尔，以谎言欺骗南斯拉夫人民的丑恶活动。
    此外，该刊登载了斯大林关于语言学的第二篇文章“论语言学的几个问题”和毛主席六月二十八日在中央人民政府委员会第八次会议上驳斥美国侵略台湾、朝鲜的讲话全文。
