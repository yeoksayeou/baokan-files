Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th (TASS): Today's *Pravda* editorial is titled "A Great Contribution to the Cause of Peace."

*Pravda* writes: The Soviet Peace Committee's statement regarding the results of the Soviet Union's signature collection drive for the World Peace Council's Stockholm Appeal has been published today.

As can be seen from this statement, the work of collecting signatures for the Stockholm Appeal in our country has been completed, with the exception of some remote areas, which will be completed in the near future. From the beginning of this movement—June 30th—until August 1st, a total of 115,275,940 Soviet citizens signed the World Peace Council's declaration.

This shows that the entire adult population of the Soviet Union has unanimously voted for peace and against war.

The signature collection movement in the Soviet Union has a truly national character. It powerfully demonstrates the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people, their complete agreement with the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and with Comrade Stalin.

All the peoples of the Soviet peace-loving multinational state unanimously voted against war, in favor of banning atomic weapons, in favor of establishing international control over compliance with this ban, and in favor of declaring the government that first uses atomic weapons against any country to be a war criminal.

In the struggle to defend peace, the Soviet working people have demonstrated a vibrant Soviet patriotism, the strength of which lies in the fact that it is not based on racial and nationalistic prejudices, but on the people's ardent love and loyalty to their Soviet motherland, and on the brotherly cooperation of the working people of all nationalities in our country.

Comrade Stalin pointed out: "Soviet patriotism is a harmonious blend of the national traditions of the peoples of the Soviet Union and the common and vital interests of all working people. Soviet patriotism does not separate all the nationalities living in our country, but unites them into a single fraternal family. This should be regarded as the foundation of the existing indestructible and growing friendship between all the nationalities of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the peoples of the Soviet Union respect the rights and independence of foreign peoples and have always shown their willingness to coexist peacefully and amicably with neighboring countries. This should be regarded as the basis on which our relations with other peace-loving countries are expanding and strengthening."

When signing the declaration, the peoples of the Soviet Union considered the struggle for world peace to be in line with the vital interests of all working people in the Soviet Union. The peace-loving policy of Lenin and Stalin stems from the fundamental principles of the Soviet social and state system. The Soviet people are engaged in creative construction work. Their efforts are aimed at achieving new successes in economic and cultural development and at further developing the beloved socialist motherland. The Central Statistical Bureau recently announced the results of the implementation of the State Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union for the second quarter of 1950. The Soviet people are extremely satisfied to see the fruits of their selfless labor, new and significant proof of the infinite superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist system.

The Soviet people review the results of their struggle and work with legitimate pride. They are filled with unshakable confidence in the continued success of our country along the road to communism. Every Soviet person is extremely concerned about stable and lasting peace. All the working people of the Soviet Union express their deep gratitude to the Bolshevik Party, to the Soviet government, and to the great Stalin for their tireless concern for strengthening world peace. The movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal throughout the country's cities and villages has shown that our people and our government are united in their efforts to safeguard peace.

The wise Stalinist foreign policy, the Soviet Union's consistent and resolute struggle for peace and international cooperation, has won our country the sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of people in all countries. When signing the Stockholm Appeal, the Soviet people expressed their complete and unanimous support for the Stalinist peace foreign policy pursued by the Soviet government.

The statement of the Soviet Peace Committee states: "The unanimous signing of the Stockholm Appeal by the Soviet people has shown the world their strong spirit of peace-loving and their unwavering will to cooperate with all countries, and has made a new contribution to the noble cause of fighting against war, strengthening peace and the security of all peoples. The Soviet people are a loyal and reliable bastion of the international organized peace front."

At numerous gatherings and conferences, the Soviet working people have condemned the foreign aggressors who are waging a piratical war against the Korean people and have demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea.

As always on days of widespread emotional upsurge, the Soviet people link their love for the motherland and their efforts for peace with inspiring creative labor. Workers in cities and villages are working selflessly for the benefit of the socialist motherland—the pillar of peace and friendship between nations—thereby confirming their signatures on the World Peace Council's declaration. They will raise even higher the banner of the nationwide socialist competition for the early completion of production plans and for improving quality and reducing production costs. Millions of workers and peasants are carrying out Stakhanovite-style peaceful work shifts, strengthening the strength of their great peace-loving country with new labor achievements. Soviet patriots fully understand that the stronger the Soviet Union, the more meaningful its role on the international stage, and the safer the cause of world peace will be.

These days, the working people of the world are watching the Soviet Union with deep love. They see the Soviet people devoted to an effort, they are standing unshakably in the struggle to defend peace. They saw the fortitude, calmness and confidence of Soviet men and women. The great example of the Soviet people inspires peace advocates in all countries to wage a selfless struggle against the imperialist warmongers. The movement for peace is unfolding day by day. It has won over millions more ordinary people and is gradually becoming a powerful force capable of saving the cause of peace.

The growing political activity of the working people of our country was manifested in the movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal. The great unity of Soviet men and women in signing the Stockholm Appeal is a striking proof that the Soviet people will continue to advance in the forefront of the ranks of warriors against war and for the consolidation of world peace. The Soviet people, believing in their strength and the victory of their just cause, will unite even more closely around the Party of Lenin and Stalin, which leads our socialist motherland to communism.

Under the guidance of the Communist Party, under the wise leadership of the great Stalin, let us advance towards new victories in the struggle to defend world peace!

    对于和平事业的伟大贡献
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：今日《真理报》社论的标题是《对于和平事业的伟大贡献》。
    《真理报》写道：苏联拥护和平委员会就苏联为世界和大常设委员会斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名运动的结果所发表的声明，已于今日公布。
    从这个声明中可以看出来，除了某些偏远的地区以外，我国为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的工作已经完成，而那些偏远地区在最近的将来也将完成。从这个运动开始——六月三十日——直到八月一日为止，苏联公民总计有一亿一千五百二十七万五千九百四十人在世界和大常委会宣言上签了名。
    由此可见，苏联全体成年人已一致投票拥护和平、反对战争。
    苏联的征集签名运动具有着真正全国的性质。它更其有力地表明了苏联人民的精神与政治上的团结，他们与共产党及苏维埃政府、与斯大林同志的全然一致。
    苏维埃爱好和平的多民族国家的一切人民一致投票反对战争，赞成禁止原子武器，赞成对这种禁令的遵守建立国际管制，并且赞成宣布首先对任何国家使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯。
    在保卫和平的斗争中，苏联劳动人民表明了生气蓬勃的苏维埃爱国主义，它的力量在于它并不是以种族的和民族主义的偏见为基础，而是以人民对他们的苏维埃祖国的热心与忠诚、以我国各族劳动人民兄弟般的合作为基础的。
    斯大林同志指出过：“苏维埃爱国主义是苏联各族人民民族传统与一切劳动人民共同切身利益之和谐的混合。苏维埃爱国主义并不是使住在我国境内的一切民族分离，而是把它们团结为单一的兄弟般的大家庭。这应该被视为苏联各族人民之间现有的不可摧毁而且日益增长的友谊的基础。同时，苏联各族人民尊重外国各族人民的权利与独立，并且一直表明它愿意与相邻各国和平而且友好共处。这应该被视为我国与其他爱好和平各国人民之间的关系所赖以扩大与增强的基础。”
    苏联各族人民在宣言上签名时，认为为世界和平而进行的斗争是符合苏联一切劳动人民之切身利益的。列宁斯大林的爱好和平的政策是从苏维埃社会与国家制度原则之根本的基础出发的。苏联人民都在从事创造性的建设工作。他们的努力都是以在经济与文化发展方面获得新成就，以及大家爱护的社会主义祖国获得进一步发展为目的。中央统计局最近公布了苏联发展国民经济国家计划一九五○年第二季的执行成绩。苏联人民极其满意地看到了他们忘我劳动的果实，社会主义经济制度比资本主义制度无限优越的新的显著证明。
    苏联人民怀着正当的自豪的心情来检阅他们的斗争与工作的成果。他们对于我国沿着走向共产主义的道路继续前进的成功，充满了不可动摇的信心。每一个苏联人都极为关心稳固与持久的和平。苏联所有的劳动人民对于布尔什维克党、对于苏联政府、对于伟大的斯大林极其一致地表示深切的感激之忱，因为他们不倦地关心着加强世界和平。遍及全国各城乡、各地区的为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动，已经表明我国人民与我国政府在他们为维护和平而作的努力中是团结一致的。
    英明的斯大林外交政策，苏联为和平与各国合作而进行的一贯与坚决的斗争，使我国获得各国亿万人民的同情与拥护。苏联人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名时，表示他们完全而且一致赞成苏联政府所执行的斯大林的和平外交政策。
    苏联拥护和平委员会的声明称：“苏联人民一致在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，向全世界表明了他们强烈的爱好和平的精神以及要与各国合作的不屈不挠的意志，并且对于为反对战争、为加强和平与各国人民的安全而斗争的崇高的事业作了新的贡献。苏联人民是国际有组织的和平阵线的忠贞可靠的堡垒。”
    苏联劳动人民在许多集会与大会上指责正对朝鲜人民进行海盗式战争的外国侵略者，并且要求外国军队自朝鲜撤退。
    正如一向在普遍情绪高涨的日子一样，苏联人民把他们对祖国的爱、他们对和平的努力跟奋励的创造性的劳动连结起来。城市与乡村的工人们为社会主义祖国——和平与各国间友谊的支柱——的利益而作忘我的工作，借以确证他们在世界和大常委会宣言上的签名。他们将更高地举起为早日完成生产计划并为改善品质及减低生产成本而进行的全国社会主义竞赛的旗帜。数百万的工人与农民正在进行斯塔哈诺夫式的和平工作班，用新的劳动业绩来加强他们伟大的爱好和平国家的实力。苏联爱国者十分明白，苏联越是强大，她在国际舞台上所起的作用越有意义，世界和平的事业越将安全无虞。
    这些天来，全世界的劳动人民都怀着深切的爱瞩望着苏联。他们看到苏联人民热中于一种努力，他们在保卫和平的斗争中是屹立不可动摇的。他们看到了苏联男女的刚毅、沉着与自信。苏联人民伟大的楷模鼓舞了各国的和平拥护者为反对帝国主义战争贩子而作忘我的斗争。拥护和平的运动一天一天地展开。它又争取了数百万普通人民并且逐渐成为足以拯救和平事业的强大力量。
    我国劳动人民日益增长的政治积极性在为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动中表现了出来。苏联男女在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的那样伟大的一致精神，显著地证明了苏联人民将继续在反对战争和争取巩固世界和平的战士队伍的最前列中前进，苏联人民相信他们的力量以及他们正义事业的胜利，必将更紧密地团结在领导我们社会主义祖国走向共产主义的列宁和斯大林的党的周围。
    在共产党的指导之下，在伟大斯大林的英明的领导之下，向着保卫世界和平斗争的新胜利前进！
