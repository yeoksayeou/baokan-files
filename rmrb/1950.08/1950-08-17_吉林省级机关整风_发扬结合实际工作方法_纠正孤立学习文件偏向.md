　　Rectification in Jilin Provincial-Level Organs
    Promote the Method of Integrating with Actual Work; Correct the Tendency of Isolated Document Study
    [Our Newspaper News] According to the Jilin Daily, the rectification movement in Jilin Province's provincial-level organs has gradually unfolded since it began in early July. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has convened two symposiums of responsible cadres from various departments to understand the rectification situation in provincial-level organs. Generally, rectification in each unit is carried out closely in conjunction with current work. However, due to the different work conditions of each department, the development is uneven. Units such as the Provincial Government's Department of Commerce have been able to study documents while inspecting work, so that the rectification study is closely integrated with the inspection of actual work from the very beginning. As a result, various problems existing in each unit have been exposed. The Provincial Government's Department of Industry and Department of Finance, in conjunction with the rectification, convened various work meetings and initially inspected the work of the leading departments. However, some departments are still studying documents in isolation, without combining them with the inspection of work. This is mainly because the leading cadres of these departments are not clear about the rectification policy of studying documents in conjunction with inspecting work, resulting in a tendency of isolated document study.
    At the symposium of responsible cadres of provincial-level organs on August 7, Comrade Liu Xi-wu of the Provincial Party Committee gave the following instructions regarding the future rectification: The study of documents must be closely integrated with the inspection of work, and the two cannot be completely separated. It is also necessary to clearly recognize that rectification work must be carried out from top to bottom and from bottom to top. Therefore, the heads of departments must be conscientious and responsible, take the lead personally, and earnestly inspect the work of their respective departments. Judging from the progress of rectification in various departments, this is indeed the case; those departments whose heads are conscientious and responsible are progressing well. This is a key to the rectification. When inspecting work, it is necessary to inspect policy viewpoints and the ideological style of leadership based on the actual work and business of the department. At the same time, it is also necessary to combine the study of documents related to the work of the department.

　　吉林省级机关整风
    发扬结合实际工作方法  纠正孤立学习文件偏向
    【本报讯】据吉林日报消息：吉林省省级机关整风运动，自七月初旬开始以来，逐渐展开。中共吉林省委为了及时了解省一级机关整风情况，曾先后召开了两次各部门负责干部座谈会。各单位整风一般是与当前工作密切结合进行的。但因各部门工作情况不同，所以发展的也不平衡。省政府商业厅等单位能够一面学习文件，一面检查工作，使整风学习一开始就和检查实际工作紧密结合起来。因此，揭发了各单位中存在着的各种问题。省政府工业厅和财政厅，结合整风召开了各种工作会议，初步检查了领导部门的工作。但是也有些部门到现在为止，仍是在就文件学习文件，没有结合检查工作。这主要是各该部门领导干部首先对学习文件与结合检查工作的整风方针不明确，以致发生了孤立学习文件的偏向。
    在八月七日的省级机关负责干部座谈会上，省委刘锡五同志对于今后整风即作了如下指示：学习文件必须要和检查工作密切结合，不能把二者截然分开，还要明白认识整风工作必须是自上而下、自下而上结合进行。因此部门首长要认真负责，亲自带头，切实检查本部门工作。根据各部门整风进行情况看来，也是如此，凡是部门首长认真负责的，就进行的好。这是整风的一个关键。检查工作时，要根据本部门实际工作、业务来检查政策观点和领导的思想作风。同时，还要结合着学习与本部门工作有关的文件。
