　　Resolutely Defend World Peace and Oppose the Use of Atomic Weapons

　　Our Responsibility
　　Tang Yongtong

　　Only socialist countries and people's democratic countries are not afraid of war. If imperialist warmongers dare to disrupt peace, they are only digging their own graves. However, the next war will use the most terrifying destructive weapons. Progressive people of the world do not want to achieve victory through great destruction. Therefore, defending peace is the responsibility of each of us.

　　Join Hands with Scientific Workers of the World
　　Bei Shizhang Zhu Xi Tong Dizhou

　　Standing on the position of the tranquility and happiness of all mankind, I hope for lasting peace. Standing on the current position of China, we are even more in urgent need of lasting peace so that we can heal the wounds suffered from past wars on the one hand, and steadily move forward to build a new China on the other. For this purpose, we are extremely willing to join hands with enlightened and sincere scientific workers in the world to protest against the warmongers. If necessary, we will all take action to resist the heinous crime of atomic war. If, unfortunately, the achievements of science are used by ambitious people to kill innocent people and destroy brilliant civilization, then even if we have not killed a single person, we are indirectly accomplices in the massacre of men, women, old and young in the entire city!

　　Peace is Indivisible
　　Zhou Lisan

　　Peace is the most important thing to the people of the world and is indivisible. However, there are very few warmongers who, for their own selfish interests, do not hesitate to use despicable means to deliberately undermine the peace that everyone loves. Since defending peace is everyone's responsibility, then we should do everything we can to use various methods to stop this conspiracy and eliminate this scum.

　　The Strength of Peace Grows by an Inch
　　Feng Depei Wang Yinglai

　　The bloodstains of World War II have not yet dried, and the question of whether World War III will happen is rippling in the hearts of countless people again. This is very unfortunate, but we must face reality, because imperialist warmongers are indeed preparing for war and creating war. It is not enough for us people to merely hope for peace. We must actively strive for peace and defend peace. We should all participate in the peace signature campaign and demand the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons. If the strength of peace grows by an inch, the crisis of war will be reduced by an inch. Warmongers will eventually succumb to the power of the people.

　　We Want to Strive for Peace
　　Dai Ailian

　　The lesson that the American imperialists learned from the Chinese war criminal—the despicable Chiang Kai-shek—seems to be not enough. He is still frantically trying to control the world and arm the Marshallized countries. Brave workers refuse to ship murderous "American aid supplies," and hundreds of millions of people sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal. This should make the imperialists and their lackeys understand that if they dare to launch a war, Chiang Kai-shek's fate is waiting for them!

　　I have been to the United States and know that the pitiful "American way of life" is the decline in the living standards of the American people. I have been to the Soviet Union and seen a great nation engaged in peaceful construction. They need peaceful construction, not destructive war. The British and American imperialists use distorted facts and propaganda to incite war mania, create provocative "events," and try their best to put the "Eastern threat" into the minds of their people, using the excuse of preparing for "resistance" to produce large quantities of aggressive weapons.

　　The Chinese people see the Soviet Union as seeing their own beautiful future. For this reason, we signed the Stockholm Declaration and made our demands together with the peace-loving people of the world. We know who suffers in war. We hate war, we don't want war. Let us shout loudly and shatter the imperialists' vicious murderous conspiracy!

　　坚决保卫世界和平  反对使用原子武器
    我们每个人的责任
    汤用彤
    社会主义国家和人民民主国家才不怕战争，帝国主义战争贩子如敢破坏和平，只是自掘坟墓。不过下次战争将使用最可怖的毁灭性武器，世界的进步的人们自不愿经过大毁灭而取得胜利，因此保卫和平是我们每一个人的责任。
    和世界科学工作者携手
    贝时璋  朱洗  童第周
    站在全人类安宁幸福的立场上，我希望有持久的和平。站在目前中国的立场上，我们更迫切需要有持久的和平；使能一方治疗过去因战争所受的伤害，一方稳步向前建设新中国。为此目的，我们极愿和世界上明达诚善的科学工作者携手，共同向战争贩子们提出抗议；必要时，大家以行动来反抗惨绝人寰的原子战争的罪行。万一不幸，科学的成果被野心家利用去杀害良善无辜的同类，毁灭灿烂的文明；那末，我们即未动手杀害一人，但间接已是屠杀全都市男女老幼的帮凶了！
    和平是不容分割的
    周立三
    和平是全世界人民所最关切的事，而且不容分割的。但现有极少数的战争贩子，为了私利，不惜用卑鄙手段，蓄意来破坏大家所爱好的和平。保卫和平，既是人人有责，那我们应当尽一切自己可能的力量，用各种方法来阻遏这种阴谋，消灭这种败类。
    和平力量长一寸
    冯德培  王应睐
    第二次世界大战的血迹还没有干，而第三次世界大战会不会发生这个疑问又荡漾在无数人的心中了。这是很不幸的，但我们必须正视现实，因为帝国主义的战争贩子确是在准备战争，制造战争，我们人民仅仅祈望和平是不够的，我们必须主动的争取和平，保卫和平，我们应该一致参加和平签名运动，要求无条件的禁止原子武器，和平的力量长一寸，战争的危机也就减一寸，战争贩子终于要屈服在人民的力量之前的。
    我们要争取和平
    戴爱莲
    美帝国主义者从中国战犯——可耻的蒋介石所得的教训好像还不够，他仍然在疯狂地企图控制世界，武装马歇尔化国家。勇敢的工人们拒绝装运杀人的“美援物资”，亿万人民在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名，这都应该使帝国主义者及其走狗们明白，要是他们胆敢发动战争，蒋介石的命运正在等待他们！
    我到过美国，知道可怜的“美国生活方式”就是美国人民大众生活水准的降低。我到过苏联，看见一个从事和平建设的伟大民族，他们需要和平的建设，不要毁灭的战争。美英帝国主义者用歪曲事实的宣传煽动战争狂，制造挑衅的“事件”，竭力把“东方的威胁”装进他们人民的脑子里，借口准备“抵抗”而大量生产侵略武器。
    中国的人民看到苏联，就像是看到自己美好的未来。为此我们在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，和全世界爱好和平的人民一齐提出我们的要求。我们知道是谁在战争中受苦。我们憎恶战争，我们不要战争。让我们大声号召，粉碎帝国主义者恶毒的杀人阴谋吧！
