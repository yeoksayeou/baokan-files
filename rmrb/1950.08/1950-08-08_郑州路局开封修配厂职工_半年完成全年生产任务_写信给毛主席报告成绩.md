　　Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Kaifeng Repair Factory Workers
    Complete Annual Production Task in Half a Year
    Write Letter to Chairman Mao Reporting Achievements
    [Our newspaper, Kaifeng News] The Kaifeng Repair Factory of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau completed the entire year's production task for 1950 in half a year. All the workers of the factory wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the production situation. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    We want to report to you, to let you know how actively and diligently we are producing under your banner and under the leadership of the Party to build a new China. You will surely be pleased. In 1949, the workers of the Kaifeng Repair Factory not only completed all 118 tasks assigned by the higher authorities, manufacturing more than 10,000 pieces of vehicles, track maintenance tools, water supply equipment, machine equipment, and spare parts; but also manufactured a semi-mobile pressure press, a nail-making machine, and a threading lathe, repaired a "Youth" car using waste materials, and renovated a coal stove.
    This year, thanks to the widespread development of rationalization proposals, the threading lathe was改造 (gaizao can mean remodeled, refitted, transformed, or reformed depending on the context) , diesel engine fuel injection nozzles were created, and a material sawing machine was imitated, overcoming difficulties and saving man-hours. In six months, we have completed the entire year's task for 1950. At the "May 1st" Zhengzhou Railway Labor Model Conference, our factory received the honorary title of Model Factory and received a bonus of 17.78 million yuan.
    Of the 234 workers in the factory, 184 have participated in spare-time remedial schools; the lowest level in the first grade can calculate five-digit addition and recognize more than 30 characters. Now the junior high school class has grown to 25 people. Machine workers have organized a technical research class, and are now studying the method of calculating gear teeth. There are 79 people who have signed apprenticeship contracts. In addition, all employees are studying the Railway Technical Management Regulations and have learned 69 articles. In terms of cultural entertainment: 44 employees are learning the waist drum. In addition to the 11 plays self-written and self-performed in the past, such as "Defending the Railway," and staged "Recapturing the Red Flag," and "Er Mao's Meritorious Service," they are also rehearsing two plays based on the model deeds of the factory, "Developing Rationalization Proposals" and "The Story of the Sawing Machine" (also known as "The Transformation of Hu Guangbi"). The Rationalization Proposal Committee has received a total of 63 rationalization proposals this year, which have played a significant role in production.
    We make a guarantee to you that we must achieve low cost, high quality, and implement an economic accounting system in the future. Responding to your call: "Strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation," and do a good job in railway transportation.
    However, we lack new technical experience and scientific organizational methods in our work. We are preparing to study actively.
    This is what we want to report to you.
    Respectfully wish you good health
              Respectfully, All Workers of the Kaifeng Repair Factory
    [Another News] Under the correct leadership of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League, all employees of the Kaifeng Repair Factory of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau fully demonstrated the power of the working class and completed the annual production task in the first half of this year, saving the country wealth worth more than 630,000 catties of wheat.
    The main reasons for the factory's brilliant achievements are that it clarified the idea of relying on workers, carried out rationalization proposals, implemented a responsibility system, promoted production competitions, and organized joint labor, with all units and groups striving to complete the production plan. After the factory accepted the 1950 production task, the leading cadres first conducted research and made specific arrangements. Each production team discussed the plan and submitted it to the management committee for research and decision. After the plan was determined, the leaders, foremen, and production officers of each department held a joint meeting and put forward guarantee conditions for the work related to mutual cooperation. The trade union production team formulated weekly guarantee plans based on specific tasks, which were controlled by the production officer, who made summaries every week and gave timely praise or criticism; and led the formulation of meritorious service conditions for individuals and groups, launching a heated competition. In the competition, many units and workers completed their tasks ahead of schedule. On the basis of the responsibility system, each unit also established an inspection team to ensure that the products met the specifications. In particular, thanks to the development of the rationalization proposal movement, the wisdom of the workers was continuously brought into play, and productivity increased rapidly, which is an important reason for completing the annual production task in half a year. Of the 63 rationalization proposals in the first half of this year, 30 were inventions and tool improvements. Foreman Bi Dayun invented tools such as the iron gourd hammer and the flat gourd hammer. For example, it only took six minutes to flatten one axle, which used to take 80 minutes. Therefore, the original plan to complete 200 flat car axles in 34 days was completed in only four days.
    The factory's production direction in the second half of the year is to mobilize everyone to use their brains, further carry out production competitions, create new records, find reasonable quota standards, and thoroughly implement the economic accounting system, in order to achieve the goal of enterprise management.

　　郑州路局开封修配厂职工
    半年完成全年生产任务
    写信给毛主席报告成绩
    【本报开封讯】郑州铁路局开封修配厂，用半年时间完成了一九五○年全年生产任务。该厂全体职工写信给毛主席，报告生产情况。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们要向您报告，使您知道我们在您的旗帜下，党的领导下，为建设新中国是怎样积极努力生产着。您一定会愉快的。开封修配厂的职工，在一九四九年内不但全部完成了上级所给的一百一十八种任务，一共制造了车辆及养路工具、给水装备，装备了机器，制造配件等一万余件；并且制造了半搬压力机、制钉机、套丝床，利用废料修配了青年号汽车，改造了石炭炉。
    今年由于合理化建议的普遍展开，改造了套丝床，创造了柴油机喷油咀、仿造锯料机等，克服了困难，节省了工时。六个月内，我们已经完成了一九五○年的全年的任务。在“五一”郑州铁路劳模大会上，我们厂得到了模范厂的光荣称号，并得到奖金一千七百七十八万元。
    全厂二百三十四名职工，有一百八十四名参加了业余补习学校；一年级最低的也会算五位的加法，认识三十多个生字。现在初中班发展到了二十五人。机器工人组织了技术研究班，现在正研究算牙轮的方法。订立师徒合同的有七十九人。另外，全体职工学习铁路技术管理规程，已学了六十九条。文化娱乐方面：有四十四个职工学习腰鼓，除了过去自编自演的“保卫铁路”及排演“夺回红旗”、“二毛立功”等十一个剧外，又在排练本厂的模范事迹“开展合理化建议”及“锯料机的故事”（又名“胡光弼的转变”）两个剧。合理化建议委员会今年共收到合理化建议六十三件，对于生产上起了很大作用。
    我们向您提出保证，今后一定要做到成本低、质量高，实行经济核算的制度。响应您的号召：“为争取国家财政经济状况基本好转而斗争”，搞好铁路运输事业。
    但是，我们在工作上，缺乏新的技术经验和科学的组织方法。我们正准备积极学习。
    这就是我们向您所要报告的。
    敬祝您身体健康
              开封修配厂全体职工敬礼
    【又讯】郑州铁路局开封修配厂全体职工在党、政、工、团正确领导下，充分发挥了工人阶级的力量，在今年上半年完成了全年生产任务，为国家节省的财富价值小麦六十三万多斤。
    该厂做出这种光辉成绩的主要原因，是明确了依靠工人的思想，开展合理化建议，贯彻了责任制，推动了生产竞赛，组织了联合劳动，各单位各小组一致为完成生产计划而奋斗。该厂接受一九五○年生产任务后，领导干部首先经过研究，作了具体布置，每个生产小组对计划进行了讨论，汇交管委会研究决定。计划确定后，各部领班、工长、生产干事即召开联席会议，针对有关互相配合的工作，分别提出保证条件。工会生产小组根据具体任务，定出每周保证计划，由生产干事掌握，每星期做出总结，及时给予表扬或批评；并领导制订个人与小组的立功条件，发动热火朝天的竞赛，在竞赛中许多单位和工友都提前完成了任务。在责任制的基础上，各单位又成立检查组，保证了产品合于规格。特别是由于开展了合理化建议运动，工人的智慧不断被发挥，生产力飞速提高，这是半年完成全年生产任务的重要原因。在今年上半年六十三件合理化建议中，属于创造发明和改良工具的就占三十件。工长毕大运发明了开铁葫芦锤，平葫芦锤等工具，如打平轴仅用六分钟打一根，以前要用八十分钟，因此原计划三十四天完成二百根平车轴的任务，仅四天就完成了。
    该厂下半年的生产方向是：发动大家开动脑筋，进一步开展生产竞赛，创造新纪录，寻找合理的定额标准，彻底实行经济核算制，为达到经营企业化的目的而努力。
