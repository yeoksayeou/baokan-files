Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: The "News" published an editorial on the 6th entitled "Ignorance of Issues of International Law." This editorial has aroused comments from Soviet scientists, legal workers, and historians. Today, the "News" published special articles by prominent Soviet scientist and Academician of the Academy of Sciences, Tarle; Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Honored Scientist, Korovin; and Professor of International Law at Moscow State University, Kozhevnikov, discussing this issue.

Academician Tarle of the Academy of Sciences

In his article entitled "On American Aggression in Korea," Tarle stated: Strictly from the perspective of international law, the war in Korea is entirely a civil war provoked and supported by the Americans, the universally known and direct purpose of which is to conquer the entire Korea. The US State Department, seeing that this civil war was of no benefit to the United States, began a direct armed attack on the Korean people with the boundless ignorance and recklessness that was most prominent in the Acheson "era." At the same time, the Security Council, through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, appealed to all countries around the world to rescue MacArthur, who was plagued by its unexpected misfortune.

The Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences stated: In other words, Mr. Lie, without batting an eye, suggested that the entire human race within the United Nations should unite and provide armed assistance to the United States. -- Look, the United States has been invaded by Kim Il-sung!

Academician Tarle of the Academy of Sciences emphasized: In the history of mankind, there has never been such a distortion of obvious facts, a distortion of all concepts of international law. Finally, he said: It is not without reason that peace advocates are protesting so vigorously against this action, which is rapidly barbarizing all methods of international diplomatic and military struggle. World public opinion and the conscience of mankind cannot tolerate the unbridled propagation of violence, nor can they tolerate such a blatant trampling on the basic principles of international law.

Corresponding Academician Korovin

Corresponding Academician Korovin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences said in his article entitled "On Aggression and Aggressors": Recently, the US government has created a new record of ignorance. The official representative of the United States to the Security Council, Austin, actually announced the heroic struggle of the Korean people for independence and national unification as "aggression by the North Korean authorities."

Since the beginning of history, aggression has always been understood as the attack of one country (the aggressor) on another country (the victim of aggression). However, the struggle between various political parties, classes, and groups within a country, no matter how intense the form of the struggle, has never been and no one has ever thought of calling it "aggression." On the contrary, foreign armed intervention in another country's civil war has been repeatedly regarded as aggression by jurists and world public opinion.

When defining the concepts of aggression and aggressors, Korovin cited some documents, such as the Charter of the United Nations, the statutes of the Nuremberg and Tokyo International Military Tribunals, etc., which provided unambiguous and precise definitions of aggression and aggressors. Korovin wrote: Moreover, regarding new and old textbooks and lectures on international law, including those from Britain and the United States, no matter how different the opinions of bourgeois celebrities are, they are always consistent on this issue, all believing that aggression is a violent action by one country against another. However, the US government, regardless of all this, completely violates international law and international practice, and actually declares the Korean civil war as "aggression" by the North Korean authorities.

Finally, the author said: "Aggression by the North Korean authorities" is originally a stupid fabrication spread by officials of the US State Department, who intended to use it to deceive the American people and foreign public, so that they could not see the unsightly faces and despicable behaviors of the modern American leaders, and wanted to portray the victims of the crime as criminals.

Professor of International Law Kozhevnikov

Professor Kozhevnikov said on this point: The US ruling clique provoked the civil war in Korea and used it as an excuse to carry out its premeditated and long-prepared armed aggression against the Korean people. Now, the US ruling clique is also trying to hypocritically use international law as a cover with the assistance of several countries that support it in the Security Council. For this purpose, it is greatly distorting the basic principles of international law. According to the principles of modern international law, the concept of aggression belongs to the scope of international relations and has nothing to do with civil war, that is to say, it has nothing to do with the scope of the internal affairs of a certain country. Nowhere in the Charter of the United Nations has it been stipulated that the Security Council has the right to discuss the issue of aggression in the event of a civil war in a certain country.

Therefore, there can be no dispute as to what the definition of aggression in international law is. This definition is universally recognized and indisputable. All attempts to distort this definition cannot escape the resolute condemnation of all those who have not yet lost their basic respect for the principles of international law, and cannot escape the resolute condemnation of all those who are fighting to make these principles victorious in international practice.

　　美政府明目张胆地践踏国际法  决逃不了世界舆论的正义谴责
    苏联科学家著文斥美帝侵略朝鲜
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：消息报于六日发表了题为《对国际法问题的无知的社论》。该社论已引起苏联科学家、法律工作者及历史学家的评论。本日消息报登载了卓越的苏联科学家科学院院士塔尔列、苏联科学院通讯院士、功勋科学工作者科罗文及莫斯科国立大学国际法教授科热夫尼科夫讨论这个问题的专文。
    科学院院士塔尔列
    塔尔列在题为《论美国侵略朝鲜》的专文中称：严格依据国际法的观点看来，在朝鲜进行的战争完全是由美国人所挑起和支持的内战，其举世皆知的直接目的是征服整个朝鲜。美国国务院看到这次内战对于美国并没有什么好处，便以其在艾奇逊“时代”表现得最为突出的无边愚昧的卤莽，开始直接武装进攻朝鲜人民。同时，安全理事会通过联合国秘书长向全世界各国呼吁，要求它们搭救已为其意想不到的不幸所困恼的麦克阿瑟。
    这位苏联科学院院士称：换句话说，赖伊先生眼睛都不?一下便建议团结联合国内的全体人类武装援助美国。——你瞧，美国已经受到金日成的侵略啦。
    科学院院士塔尔列强调称：在人类历史上，从来没有见过这样歪曲明显事实，歪曲一切国际法概念的事情。最后他说：和平拥护者这样风起云涌地抗议这种将国际的外交与军事斗争的一切方法迅速野蛮化的行动，不是无的放矢的。世界舆论和人类的良知都不能容许肆无忌惮地宣扬暴力，不能容许对国际法的基本原则这样明目张胆地践踏。
    科学院通讯院士科罗文
    苏联科学院通讯院士科罗文在其题为《论侵略与侵略者》一文中说：近来美国政府已创愚昧无知的新纪录。美国出席安理会的正式代表奥斯汀竟宣布朝鲜人民争取独立与国家统一的英勇斗争为“北朝鲜当局的侵略”。
    自有历史以来，侵略是永远不变地被了解为一国（侵略者）对另一国（侵略的牺牲者）的进攻。但是对一国以内的各政党、阶级与集团间的斗争，无论斗争的形式怎样剧烈，却从来不曾也从来没有人想到要称为“侵略”。相反地，外国对另一国内战的武装干涉已经被法律家与世界舆论一再认为侵略了。
    科罗文在给侵略与侵略者的概念下定义时引证了一些文件，例如联合国宪章、纽伦堡及东京国际军事法庭的法规等，这些文件提供了关于侵略与侵略者的毫不含糊的确切定义。科罗文写道：并且，关于国际法的新旧教科书与讲义，包括英美的在内，不论资产阶级名流派的意见怎样纷歧，在这一问题上却总是一致的，全认为侵略是一国对别国的暴力行动。然而，美国政府却不顾这一切，完全违反国际法与国际惯例，竟宣布朝鲜内战为北朝鲜当局的“侵略”。
    最后，该文作者说：“北朝鲜当局的侵略”原是美国国务院官员所传播的愚蠢捏造，捏造者本想借此蒙蔽美国人民与外国公众，使他们看不见现代美国的头子那副见不得人的嘴脸和令人不齿的行为，并想把罪行的牺牲者说成罪犯。
    国际法教授科热夫尼科夫
    科热夫尼科夫教授论到这点说：美国统治集团挑起了朝鲜的内战，并用作借口来进行其对朝鲜人民处心积虑而且准备良久的武装侵略。现在，美国统治集团又想借安理会中支持它的几个国家的援助，而伪善地以国际法作掩护。为了这个目的，它正在大大地歪曲国际法的基本原则。根据现代国际法的原则，侵略这个概念属于国际关系的范围，与内战毫不相干，这就是说，与一定国家的内政范围毫不相干。联合国宪章没有一处，没有一项曾规定安理会在一定国家发生内战的场合中有权讨论侵略的问题。
    因此，关于国际法上侵略的定义为何这一点，是不能有什么争论的。这个定义为众所公认而且是无可争辩的，一切意欲歪曲这个定义的企图，都逃不了一切迄今仍未丧失其对国际法原则的起码尊重的人的坚决谴责，逃不了一切正在为使这些原则能在国际上胜利实践而斗争的人的坚决谴责。
