Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th (TASS): The "Pravda" published an editorial titled "The People of the World Fight for Peace," stating that the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress issued a communiqué yesterday on the progress of the signature campaign for the Peace Declaration. This movement is underway around the world, and in some countries is only just beginning, but in the past three months, 273 million people have signed the declaration.

　　The Standing Committee's communiqué proves the broad response the Stockholm Appeal has received among all strata of people in all countries. Hundreds of millions of men and women, regardless of race and nationality, regardless of political views and religious beliefs, regardless of social status, have unanimously signed the World Peace Declaration. Thus, the declaration has become a general program, on the basis of which all peoples of the world are uniting to actively fight for peace. The movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal demonstrates the indomitable determination of hundreds of millions of good men and women to crush the evil plans of the imperialist war instigators and to support the cause of peace.

　　The movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal in the Soviet Union is a great contribution to the noble cause of opposing war and striving to consolidate universal peace and security internationally. All the Soviet people express their full and unanimous approval of the Soviet government's Stalinist peaceful diplomacy.

　　In the People's Democracies, the movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal is also proceeding in an atmosphere of great political upsurge. The movement has been launched on an extremely broad scale in the People's Republic of China.

　　The movement to strive for peace and stop the imperialist war instigators has become a movement of all peoples of the world. The broad masses of people in all strata are recognizing that the struggle against war instigators and the defense of peace is the cause of all peoples of the world.

　　The current international situation requires the people of the world to mobilize their strength to safeguard peace. The United States' aggression against Korea and other parts of Asia clearly tells all peoples of the world that the crisis threatening peace continues to grow, and that only by uniting all the forces of peace-loving peoples and only by further expanding the peace movement can the danger of a new war be avoided.

　　The movement of people of all countries to protest against the U.S. government's armed intervention in Korea is rising daily. All peace-loving people welcome and warmly support the proposals put forward by the Soviet representative in the Security Council, which are aimed at restoring and strengthening peace in Korea and at restoring the legitimate nature of the Security Council. Millions more people are increasingly determined to prevent the realization of the vile plans of the American aggressors to conspire against the peoples of Asia and against universal peace. To establish lasting peace throughout the world is the indomitable will of hundreds of millions of people in all countries of the world.

　　The signature collection movement continues. Millions more men and women are voting in favor of banning atomic weapons. The task of the peace advocates is to strive for the participation of all people who do not want war in the daily struggle for peace. Everyone who has signed the Stockholm Appeal must become an active peace fighter. The guarantee of the victory of the cause of peace lies first and foremost in expanding the peace movement, in striving for the participation of an increasingly broad number of workers, peasants, the middle class of urban people, and people from the scientific and cultural circles in the struggle to strive for peace and oppose the imperialist war instigators.

　　The Second World Peace Congress is just over two months away. The glorious duty and combat task of all those dedicated to the great cause of striving for solid and lasting peace and opposing the danger of a new war is to strive for millions more people to sign the declaration banning atomic weapons, and to further expand the peace movement.

　　"Pravda" concludes: The peace-loving people of all countries will respond to the Standing Committee's declaration with an even more strengthened struggle for peace. They will unite their ranks more closely around the Soviet Union, the strong fortress of universal peace, and around Comrade Stalin, the great standard-bearer of peace and the leader of progressive humanity.

　　全世界人民为和平而斗争
    真理报社论摘要
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：真理报以“全世界人民为和平而斗争”为题发表社论称，世界拥护和平大会常设委员会于昨天发表了关于和平宣言签名运动的进展的公报。这个运动正在世界各地进行，而且在某些国家里还仅仅在开始，但在过去三个月中间便已有两亿七千三百万人在该宣言上签了名。
    常设委员会的公报证明了，斯德哥尔摩宣言在世界各国的各阶层人民中间，所得到的广泛响应。亿万男女，不分种族和国籍、不分政治见解和宗教信仰，不分社会地位，都一致在世界和平宣言上签了名。这样，该宣言便成了一个总的纲领，全世界各族人民都在这纲领的基础上团结起来，为争取和平而积极斗争。为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动说明了亿万善良男女要求粉碎帝国主义战争挑拨者的罪恶计划，要求拥护和平事业的不屈不挠的决心。
    苏联的为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动，对于反对战争、争取巩固国际间普遍和平和安全的斗争这一崇高事业，乃是巨大的贡献。全体苏联人民表示他们充分一致地赞同苏联政府的斯大林和平外交政策。
    在各人民民主国家里，为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动，也在巨大的政治高涨的气氛中进行。该运动已以极广大的规模在中华人民共和国开展起来。
    争取和平和制止帝国主义战争挑拨者的运动，已经变成了世界各族人民的运动。各阶层的广大人民都正在认识到，反对战争挑拨者和保卫和平的斗争，乃是全世界各族人民的事业。
    目前的国际局势要求全世界人民动员自己的力量来维护和平。美国侵略朝鲜及亚洲其他地区的行为分明地告诉了全世界各族人民：威胁和平的危机仍在继续增长，只有团结爱好和平的各族人民的一切力量，只有更加扩大和平运动，才能避免新战争的危险。
    各国人民抗议美国政府武装干涉朝鲜的运动日益高涨。一切爱好和平的人民都欢迎并热烈支持安理会苏联代表提出的建议，这些建议旨在恢复与加强朝鲜的和平，旨在恢复安理会的合法性质。又有千百万人民越来越深具决心，要阻止美国侵略者所阴谋策划的反对亚洲各族人民、反对普遍和平的卑鄙的计划之实现。建立全世界持久和平，这就是世界各国亿万人民不屈不挠的意志。
    征集签名运动在继续进行着。又有千百万男女投票拥护禁用原子武器。和平拥护者的任务就是争取一切不希望战争的人们参加争取和平的日常斗争。每个在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名的人必须成为积极的和平战士。和平事业取得胜利的保证首先就在于扩大和平运动、在于争取越来越广大的工人、农民、城市人民的中等阶层群众及科学与文化界人士，参加争取和平、反对帝国主义战争挑拨者的斗争。
    距第二次世界拥护和平大会不过两个多月了。一切献身于争取稳固与持久和平、反对新战争危险的伟大事业的人们，他们的光荣职责与战斗任务，就是再争取亿万人民在禁用原子武器的宣言上签名，就是更加扩大和平运动。
    真理报结语称：一切国家爱好和平的人民都将以更加加强争取和平的斗争来响应常设委员会的宣言。他们将把他们的队伍更紧密地团结在普遍和平的强大堡垒——苏联的周围、团结在和平的伟大旗手——进步人类的领袖斯大林同志的周围。
