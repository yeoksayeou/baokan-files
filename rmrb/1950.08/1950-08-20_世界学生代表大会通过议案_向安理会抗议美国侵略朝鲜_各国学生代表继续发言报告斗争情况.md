Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 19th: The Second World Student Congress continued its meeting on the 17th. The Congress listened to the speech of the Korean student representative and passed a resolution protesting the US aggression against Korea.

The Korean representative, Kim Bong-woon (transliteration), a student of Seoul University, strongly condemned the shameful behavior of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang in attacking Korea in his speech. He angrily recounted the atrocities of the US aggressors in Korea. Kim Bong-woon's speech aroused the greatest anger and sympathy from the representatives of various countries. When he shouted "No intervention in Korea," the whole place resounded with stormy applause.

The Korean delegation proposed that the Congress pass a resolution protesting the continued US aggression against Korea to the Security Council. The resolution stated: "The Congress strongly condemns the shameful barbaric bombing and massacre of Korean civilians by the United States. We, representing the four million members of the International Student Union, demand that the Security Council take the most resolute and urgent measures to stop the US aggression against Korea, withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, and let the Korean people decide their own destiny."

The US student representative, Magis, then spoke. He powerfully declared: The US delegation unanimously seconded the resolution proposed by the Korean delegation. The US aggression and destructive atrocities in Korea violate the will of the American people. Now all honest Americans demand an end to US intervention and atrocities in Korea. We demand the withdrawal of US troops from Korea and express our solidarity with the Korean people.

Representatives from various countries spoke one after another, unanimously supporting the resolution proposed by the Korean delegation.

The Italian representative spoke in favor of the resolution and suggested that the Congress issue an appeal to students and student groups around the world, calling on them to rise up against US aggression against Korea.

When voting on the proposals of the Korean and Italian delegations, the complete unity of the vast majority of the representatives participating in the Congress was demonstrated. Only the British delegation and a very small number of other representatives abstained.

At the suggestion of the Hungarian delegation, the Congress decided to send a telegram to the Korean Democratic Youth League to express its respect.

At the evening meeting on the 17th, Indonesian student representative Magrand reported on the struggle of the Indonesian people against the Dutch colonialists and their American patrons.

Bulgarian student representative Dimitrov reported on the life and study of students in the People's Democratic Republic of Bulgaria. He described the great care of the Bulgarian government and the Communist Party for educating the younger generation of socialist builders. Dimitrov said: Almost all Bulgarian students have signed the Stockholm Appeal.

Vietnamese student representative Tran Chang-kuo (transliteration) delivered a speech, recounting the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against French imperialism and the heinous crimes committed by French colonialists and their running dogs. On behalf of Vietnamese students, Tran Chang-kuo expressed his gratitude to progressive students all over the world for supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, and expressed his close ties with the French people who are struggling against the imperialists' war in Vietnam.

Bernie, Chairman of the National Union of French Students, said: The members of the French delegation guarantee to bring Tran Chang-kuo's speech to all French students.

Iraqi student representative Patron reported that Iraqi students actively participated in the peace movement despite brutal terror and persecution.

The guest who spoke at the Congress on the 17th was the famous Soviet writer Ehrenburg. He called on students all over the world to contribute all their strength to the sacred cause of the struggle for peace. Ehrenburg emphasized: I know that you can defend culture, defend the cause of peace, and defend the beautiful future of mankind.
