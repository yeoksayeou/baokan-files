Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd. The Shandong Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China began piloting cattle insurance in Shanghe County in March of this year. Since the trial implementation, it has been warmly welcomed by local farmers.

During the trial, the company first selected Da Li Township in Chengguan District of Shanghe County as a typical pilot area. The biggest obstacle initially encountered was that many farmers had concerns about cattle insurance. For example, they did not believe that they would actually be compensated if their cattle died after being insured; some suspected that this was the People's Government "collecting cattle tax," and were afraid that they would not be allowed to buy or sell the cattle after registration. Therefore, they mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards cattle insurance. The company cooperated with the township and village governments, conducting extensive publicity through various meetings and using facts to dispel farmers' concerns. For example, when Han Shengcheng's two-year-old calf from Han Family Hutong in the township died of illness, the company immediately compensated the full amount of grain as stipulated in the contract, which influenced farmers to come and take out insurance one after another. Eighteen villages in Anmei, Zhoujia, Changzhuang and other townships in Chengguan District also jointly organized four cattle insurance associations and came to take out insurance collectively. According to preliminary statistics, farmers in only the Chengguan and Yinxiang districts of Shanghe County have insured 6,000 cattle. In Da Li Township, which was initially used as a typical pilot area, there are a total of 138 cattle in nine villages, of which 130 are insured, accounting for 94 percent of the township's total number of cattle; among the eight uninsured cattle, five originally wanted to be insured, but did not meet the insurance conditions, so in reality only three were uninsured. Recently, cattle plague occurred in Panqiao, Changwang, and ZhengLuo districts of Shanghe County. The company, in cooperation with the Bohai Veterinary Hospital's cattle epidemic prevention injection program, has actively launched cattle insurance work in these three districts. Now the farmers are all saying: "This is thousands of households helping one family"; "Farmers depend on cattle for food, and they feel relieved when they are insured."

Now, in addition to continuing to expand cattle insurance work throughout Shanghe County, the company is also conducting key trials in De County and other places, with a view to further gaining experience in order to promote it.

The method used by the Shandong Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China for piloting cattle insurance is: to establish cattle insurance associations based on townships or villages, composed of cattle owner representatives and local cadres, as cattle owner representative bodies, to lead and handle the insurance affairs of the township or village. The focus is on joint collective insurance by farmers, supplemented by individual farmer insurance. The procedures for handling cattle insurance are cattle registration – assessment of the insured amount – signing of the contract. The insured amount is determined according to the local market price of cattle. The insurance premium rate is set at two percent, based on the general cattle mortality rate of two percent in Shandong Province last year.

　　山东人民保险公司
    试办耕牛保险受到农民欢迎
    商河县两个区即投保六千头
    【新华社济南二日电】中国人民保险公司山东分公司于今年三月间着手在商河县境试办耕牛保险；试办以来，受到当地农民的热烈欢迎。
    该公司在试办中先择定商河县城关区大李乡作为典型试办区。当时首先遇到的最大障碍是许多农民对耕牛保险存在着许多顾虑，如：不相信自己的耕牛在保险后死亡时真会得到赔偿；有的怀疑这是人民政府“收牛税”，又怕牛登记后不准买卖。因此，他们对耕牛保险多抱观望态度。该公司就和乡、村政府配合，一面通过各种会议，广泛进行宣传；一面用事实来消除农民的顾虑。如该乡韩家胡同韩升成的两岁小牛染病死亡后，公司立即按照契约上所规定的保额粮如数赔偿，因而影响了农民纷纷前来投保。城关区的安美、周家、常庄等乡十八个村，也共同组织了四个耕牛保险会，集体前来投保。据初步统计：商河县现仅城关、殷巷两区农民投保的耕牛已达六千头。首先作为典型试办区的大李乡九个村共有耕牛一百三十八头，投保的有一百三十头，占该乡耕牛总数的百分之九十四；未投保的八头中，有五头原欲投保，但不合保险条件，因此实际只有三头未投保。商河县在潘桥、常王、郑洛三区最近先后发生牛瘟，该公司配合着渤海兽医院所进行的耕牛防疫注射，已在这三个区积极展开耕牛保险工作。现在农民们都说：“这是千家万户帮一家”；“庄户人家靠牛吃饭，保上了险就放心了”。
    现在该公司除在商河全县继续展开耕牛保险工作外，又在德县等地作重点试办，以期进一步取得经验，以便推广。
    中国人民保险公司山东分公司试办耕牛保险的办法是：以乡或村为单位，成立耕牛保险会，由牛主代表及当地干部参加组成，作为牛主代表机关，领导与办理该乡或村的保险事务。以农户联合集体投保为主，个别农户投保为辅。办理耕牛保险的手续是耕牛登记——评定保额——签订契约。保额依当地耕牛市价决定，保险费率根据去年山东省耕牛死亡率一般是百分之二的情况；定为百分之二。
