Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 12th. According to TASS Rome: The Italian reactionary government dispatched a large number of police on the night of the 5th to search the headquarters of the Rome Municipal Committee of the Italian Communist Party and the offices of seven district committees. The police surrounded the municipal committee and the district committees. Under the pretext of searching for "weapons and explosives," they stormed into the buildings, destroying everything, seizing various documents and printed materials, and arresting sixty people, including the secretary of the Tuscolano District Committee of the Communist Party.
　　
This act of the Gasperi government, which infringes upon democratic freedom, has aroused serious protests from all sides. The Secretariat of the Rome Municipal Committee of the Italian Communist Party held a meeting that night and issued a statement exposing the illegal actions of the police, stating that they would repel any attempt to restore fascist order. Senator Scoccimarro raised an urgent inquiry to the government in the Senate. He pointed out: "Conducting searches at night with a very large police force is clear evidence of real intimidation and provocation, reminiscent of the harassment during the Hitler occupation."
　　
According to a Telegraph Agency report on the 9th: The Joint Committee of the Communist and Socialist Parties of Rome issued a statement pointing out that the fruitless search by the police was unjustified and unconstitutional. The statement said: The police action was an attempt to divert public attention from the government's failure in domestic and foreign policies.
　　
Representatives of trade unions and mass organizations in Rome held a meeting, condemning the government's actions and declaring that no provocation could divert workers from advancing along the road of defending trade union freedom, living standards, and peace.

　　意反动政府非法搜查意共机关
    罗马群众团体集会抗议
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社罗马消息：意大利反动政府于五日夜间，派遣大批警察搜查了意大利共产党罗马市委会和七个区委会的会址。警察包围了市委会和区委会。他们在所谓搜查“武器与爆炸物”的借口下，冲进房屋，捣毁一切物件，劫走各种文件和印刷品并且捕去了六十个人，其中包括图斯科拉诺区共产党区委会书记。
    加斯贝利政府这一侵害民主自由的行动，已引起各方的严重抗议。意共罗马市委会书记局当夜即举行会议，发表了一项揭露警察非法行动的声明，表示他们要击退任何想恢复法西斯秩序的企图。参议员斯科西马罗在参议院向政府提出紧急质询。他指出：“用非常庞大的警察部队在夜间进行搜查，这就是真正恫吓与挑拨行动的明证，令人想起希特勒占领期间的侵扰行动。”
    另据电通社九日消息：罗马共产党与社会党联合委员会发表声明，指出警察的无结果的搜查是没有理由的，并且是违反宪法的。声明说：警察行动是企图转移公众对于政府的内政外交政策失败的注意力。
    罗马工会与各群众团体代表举行会议，斥责政府的行动，并且声明：任何的挑拨都不能转移工人朝着保卫工会自由、生活标准与和平的道路前进。
