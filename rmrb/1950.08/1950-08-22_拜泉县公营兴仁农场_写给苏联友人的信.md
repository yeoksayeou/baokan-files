To our Soviet friends:

　　We are workers at the Xingren State Farm in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province. This spring, the province distributed a batch of horse-drawn farm implements. This year, our farm planted 70 *xiang* of wheat, and we are now harvesting it with combines. We are using three combines, and each one can harvest about four *xiang* (large *xiang*) of land per day, which saves a lot of effort.

　　We remember when we harvested wheat last year, the weather was very hot. The sun was scorching above, and the ground was baking below. Our backs ached from bending over. But no matter how uncomfortable we were, we didn't dare straighten up, because if we did, we would fall behind others, so we had to endure the pain and keep going. Some people even got sick from the exhaustion. This year, when we use the combines, we harness four horses, and the people sit on top. It is so fast! The wheat falls down quickly in front, and then it is laid down in rows behind, so people can follow behind and bundle it up without getting tired at all.

　　Our farm's wheat field is near the highway, and passing travelers and nearby villagers all come to watch. They all say it's good. One villager gave a thumbs up and said, "This machine is so good! How did they research it! It cuts the stubble shorter than people can cut it, really good!" Everyone watched with envy and said, "When we have money, we must buy one."

　　Our wheat will be finished harvesting in one more day. We plan to use combines to harvest the autumn crops. Every one of our workers has realized that only by improving technology and using new tools can we truly save labor. We haven't had to suffer this year. Thank you. We salute you! We shake your hands!

　　In the future, we hope you will introduce more good experiences. We want to strengthen our studies and use all our strength to run the farm well and lead the masses.

　　Wishing you good health!

　　All workers of the Xingren State Farm in Baiquan County, Northeast

### 拜泉县公营兴仁农场  写给苏联友人的信

　　拜泉县公营兴仁农场
    写给苏联友人的信苏联朋友们：
    我们是黑龙江省拜泉县公营兴仁农场的工人。今年春天，由省里发下来了一批马拉农具。我们场子今年种了七十垧小麦，现在正用收割机割着呢，一共使用三台，每台一天能割四垧来地（大垧），可省劲啦。
    我们想起去年割麦子的时候，天气非常热，上边晒，底下烤，弯得腰发疼。但不管怎样难受，也不敢直腰，因为一直腰就落到别人的后面去了，就得忍着疼往前干。有的都累出病了。今年我们使用的时候，套四匹马，人还坐在上面，可快啦。前面麦子刷刷的倒，后边则一铺子一铺子的放下来，人跟在后面捆，一点也不累。
    我们场子的麦地靠近汽车路，来往行人和附近的老乡都来看。他们都说好。有个老乡把大拇指头一举说：“这机器真好使，人家怎么研究的啦！割的槎比人割的都矮，真好！”大家都眼热地说：“等有钱的时候非买它一台不行。”
    我们麦子，再有一天就割完了。计划割大秋时用收割机割。我们每个工友都体会到了，只有提高技术使用新的工具，才是真正节省劳动力。我们今年没挨着累，感谢你们，向你们敬礼！向你们握手！
    以后希望你们多介绍好经验，我们要加强学习，用全力来把农场搞好，带动起群众来。
    敬祝你们健康！
