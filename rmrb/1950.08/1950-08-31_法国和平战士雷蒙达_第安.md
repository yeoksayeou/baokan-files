　　French Peace Fighter Raymonde Dien

　　The French imperialists' colonial war in Vietnam is being met with increasingly widespread opposition from the French working people. Tens of thousands of dockworkers, sailors, and railway workers are resolutely refusing to load, unload, or transport war materials to Vietnam to massacre the Vietnamese people. In this heroic struggle, many brave peace fighters have emerged, and Raymonde Dien is one of them.

　　Raymonde Dien is a twenty-year-old girl. On February 23rd of this year, in Bordeaux, France, in order to prevent a train carrying tanks from passing, she was the first to risk her life by lying down on the tracks. Hundreds of peace supporters followed her example, thus preventing the train from passing.

　　Raymonde Dien's heroic act has won the sympathy and admiration of peace-loving people all over the world. However, the reactionary Bordeaux Military Tribunal regarded Raymonde Dien as a criminal and wanted to sentence her to three years in prison. This illegal sentence by the Bordeaux Military Tribunal, which was hostile to peace and fearful of peace, aroused widespread anger and protest from the French working people.

　　A wave of strikes swept through enterprises in Bordeaux, and delegations from forty provinces of France came to Bordeaux to demand the release of Raymonde Dien. The court received a large number of protest letters and telegrams from all over the country and the world every day. Under these circumstances, the chief judge of the military tribunal, using intestinal cramps as an excuse, avoided getting involved in this despicable affair, forcing the authorities to hurriedly summon another judge on vacation to replace him.

　　On the day of the hearing on May 30th, many nationally renowned and highly respected witnesses attended the court, including members of parliament, municipal councilors, generals, prominent people's leaders, heroes of the resistance movement, and mothers of soldiers who had died needlessly in the vile colonial war in Vietnam. They all expressed their solidarity with this young heroine, and said that in the same situation, they would take the same action. Under the tide of protest from the French people and the condemnation of progressive humanity and progressive public opinion around the world, the reactionary French government had to change the original three-year sentence under the so-called "super cruelty" decree to one year.

　　After being detained in prison, Raymonde Dien wrote to the Paris newspaper *L'Humanité*, expressing her loyalty, indomitable heroism, and firm confidence in the struggle for peace. In her letter, she said:

　　"I am in jail because I joined a large army of ordinary people fighting for peace...

　　"After the second interrogation, I heard the song *The Young Guard* in prison. I felt happy, I was so happy that I wanted to laugh...

　　"Today, they gave me 'a serving'... coffee and a piece of black bread. I will stay here as long as they need me to, and I will fight to the end!

　　"They call me a 'political prisoner,' just like they called patriots during the Nazi occupation. Even the women among the prison staff sympathize with me.

　　"Please don't worry about me, I will fulfill the duty of a French woman, I will fight for peace."

　　Raymonde Dien's heroic act inspired the French people's confidence in fighting for peace and promoted the French people's peace movement. Today, 12 million people in France have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal. This is the most powerful response of the French people to the French reactionary government's obstruction and suppression of the peace movement.

　　法国和平战士雷蒙达·第安
    法帝国主义者在越南进行着的殖民战争，遭到法国劳动人民愈来愈广泛的反对。成千成万的码头工人、海员与铁路工人都坚决地拒绝装卸或运送战争物资前往越南去屠杀越南人民。在这一英勇的斗争中，涌现了许多勇敢的和平斗士，雷蒙达·第安就是其中的一个。
    雷蒙达·第安是二十岁的女孩子。今年二月二十三日在法国波尔多地方，为了要阻止装运坦克的火车通过，她首先冒着生命的危险，卧倒在铁轨上，数百名和平拥护者追随了她的榜样，因而使火车未能通过。
    雷蒙达·第安这一英勇的行为，获得了全世界爱好和平人民的同情与景仰。但是反动的波尔多军事法庭竟把雷蒙达·第安看作罪犯，要判处她三年徒刑。波尔多军事法庭这一敌视和平、惧怕和平的非法判处，激起了法国劳动人民的普遍的愤怒与抗议。
    罢工的浪潮席卷了波尔多各企业，法国四十个省人民的代表团来到波尔多，要求释放雷蒙达·第安。法庭每天从全国各地与世界各国收到了大批的抗议信件与电报。在这种情况之下，军事法庭的首席法官借口肠子绞痛，避免插手这件卑劣的事务，使当局不得不匆匆忙忙地把在休假期中的另一个法官召来替代他。
    在五月三十日审问的那一天，出席法庭的有许多全国闻名并且深受敬重的证人，内中有议会议员、市政委员、将军、著名的人民领袖、抗战运动的英雄，在越南卑鄙的殖民战争中无谓牺牲的阵亡兵士们的母亲。他们都表示与这位年青的女英雄休戚相关，在同样的情况下，他们表示也会采取同样的行动。在法国人民的抗议怒潮与全世界进步人类与进步舆论的指责之下，法国反动政府不得不将原来按照所谓“超级残酷”法令要判处三年的徒刑改为一年。
    雷蒙达·第安被拘入狱以后，曾致函巴黎《人道报》，表示她为争取和平斗争的忠贞不屈的英勇精神与坚强信心，她在信内说：
    “我坐监牢是因为我加入了一个争取和平的普通人民的大军……。
    “在第二次审问后，我在监牢中听到了《青年近卫军》的歌子。我感到我是幸福的，我快乐得想发笑。……
    “今天一整天他们给了我‘一份菜’……咖啡饮料和一块黑面包。需要我留在这里多长时间，我就留在这里多长时间，而我将要斗争到最后！
    “他们把我叫做‘政治犯’，正如过去被纳粹占领时期称呼爱国者那样。甚至连在监狱的办事人员中的妇女们，都对我表示同情。
    “请你们不要为我不安，我要尽一个法国妇女的义务，我要为争取和平而斗争。”
    雷蒙达·第安的英勇行为，鼓舞了法国人民为争取和平而斗争的信心，推动了法国人民的和平运动，今天法国已有一千二百万人在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签了名，这是法国人对法国反动政府阻挠并镇压和平运动的最有力的答复。
