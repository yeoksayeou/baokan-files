　　"People's China" Volume Two, Issue Two Published

　　The English-language bi-monthly magazine "People's China," Volume Two, Issue Four, was published on August 16th. This issue features the editorial: "People of All Asia, Unite!"; there are four special articles, including Guo Moruo's "A General Survey of Chinese Culture," "The Korean People's Struggle for Liberation," and "American Imperialist Aggression Against Taiwan," among others. "The Peace Movement in China" is a comprehensive report on the recent developments of the peace signature campaign nationwide. The feature section includes "'Little Korea' and the American Imperialist Paper Tiger," which contains facts that even the imperialists themselves have had to admit, vividly exposing the aggressors' outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature. "An Open Letter to the American People" is a reader's letter that nakedly exposes the atrocities of the American rulers in the Far East. "Strive for Peace! Oppose Aggression!" summarizes the Chinese people's actions against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea over the past three years.
