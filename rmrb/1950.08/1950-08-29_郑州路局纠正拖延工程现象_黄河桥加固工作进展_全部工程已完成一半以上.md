Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: The reinforcement project of the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, which was previously delayed by the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, has made significant progress since Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan severely criticized the responsible personnel. The number of technical personnel at the construction site has increased from three to thirteen, and the number of workers has increased from seven hundred to one thousand four hundred. Because the leading cadres have profoundly reviewed the errors of delaying the project in the past and strengthened leadership, the work efficiency of all staff has increased accordingly: for example, the drilling efficiency has increased by two-thirds, and the bridge deck paving has initially improved from only being able to pave one span per day to now being able to pave four or five spans.

As of August 18, more than 50% of the entire reinforcement project has been completed, and it has been inspected and deemed qualified by personnel sent by the Ministry of Railways. According to estimates by the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, the entire project can be completed by the end of September this year.

　　郑州路局纠正拖延工程现象
    黄河桥加固工作进展
    全部工程已完成一半以上
    【新华社二十七日讯】曾被郑州铁路管理局延误的京汉路黄河铁桥加固工程，自经铁道部滕代远部长对负责人员进行严正批评后，目前已有显著进展。施工场所的技术人员已由三人增加到十三人，工人也由七百人增加到一千四百人。由于领导人员深刻检讨了过去拖延工程的错误，加强了领导，所以全体工作人员的工作效率都随之提高：如钻眼效率已提高了三分之二，铺桥面最初每天只能铺一孔，现在已提高到铺四孔或五孔。
    截至八月十八日止，全部加固工程已完成了百分之五十以上，并已经铁道部派人检查认为合格。据郑州铁路管理局估计，全部工程可争取在本年九月底完工。
