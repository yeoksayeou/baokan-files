Xinhua News Agency, August 28th:

　　The American imperialist savages, who take pride in killing, recently released figures on the "battle achievements" of bombing Korea, proving that the vast majority of bombs dropped by American planes were used to indiscriminately bomb peaceful Korean towns. According to Reuters: General Stratemeyer, commander of the US Far East Air Force, announced on the 25th that in the first sixty days of the Korean War, US planes flew a total of 20,500 sorties, dropping 15,200 tons of bombs. Among them, the most bombs were dropped by Superfortress bombers, mainly used to bomb peaceful Korean cities, reaching 11,500 tons; B-26 bombers dropped 2,000 tons. The above two items account for 80 percent of the total bombs dropped. The bombs dropped by fighter planes, mainly used on the front lines, amounted to 1,700 tons, accounting for only 20 percent of the total bombs dropped. Under the powerful attacks of the Korean People's Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery units, Stratemeyer had to admit that the rampaging American planes "also paid a price."

　　美国公布轰炸朝鲜“战果”
    万余吨炸弹投入和平城市
    【新华社二十八日讯】以杀人为荣的美帝国主义生番，最近在公布轰炸朝鲜“战果”的数目字中，证明了美机所投炸弹，绝大部分是用来滥炸朝鲜和平城镇。据路透社讯：美远东空军司令斯特拉特梅耶二十五日宣布：朝鲜战争的头六十天中，美机共出动二万零五百次，投弹一万五千二百吨。其中，主要用来轰炸朝鲜和平城市的超级空中堡垒所投的炸弹最多，达一万一千五百吨；Ｂ二十六型轰炸机投弹二千吨。以上两项占投弹总数百分之八十。而主要用于前线的战斗机所投炸弹为一千七百吨，仅占投弹总数百分之二十。在朝鲜人民空军及高射炮部队的有力打击下，斯特拉特梅耶不得不承认，肆虐的美机，“也不是没有付出代价的”。
