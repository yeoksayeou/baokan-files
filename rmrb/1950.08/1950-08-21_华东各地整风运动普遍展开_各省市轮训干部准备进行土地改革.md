Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 19th: Rectification movements in East China have been universally unfolded. The first phase of rectification in party schools of various provinces (regions) and cities has largely concluded; rectification movements at the level of special districts and counties are being gradually unfolded. The rectification movement in first-level organs of the East China Administrative Region and the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing also began in August.
	Regardless of the method adopted, attention must be paid to connecting with reality and improving work.

	In this rectification movement, various localities have generally adopted the following three methods:

	First: Opening party schools and training classes, and drawing cadres to concentrate on rectification in rotation. These party schools or training classes mainly train cadres for land reform, generally trained at the provincial (regional), special district, and county levels. Each level first trains a phase, serving as the working backbone for the next level's rotational training of cadres. Cadres of the land reform work teams also participate in training at the same time. Each phase roughly spends two-thirds or one-half of the time on rectification, and the remaining one-third or one-half on studying land reform policies. According to statistics from the first phase of party schools in Zhejiang, Northern Anhui, Southern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, and Southern Jiangsu provinces (regions), 5,348 party member cadres have been trained. The advantage of this rectification method is that time is easy to control and leadership is easy to implement. The disadvantage is that it is divorced from work units, the connection with reality is relatively poor, and it is difficult to collect opinions from the masses; other methods must be used to supplement this aspect.

	Second: On-the-job rectification. Cadres in organs above the county level and urban work cadres mainly conduct on-the-job rectification. The method is to summarize work and rectify work styles according to work departments or work systems. The Zhejiang Provincial Rectification Leading Organ also stipulated that rectification can be carried out separately and sequentially according to the specific conditions of each unit. The advantage of this rectification method is that it can be closely integrated with current work tasks, rectifying work styles while improving work. However, when adopting this rectification method, attention should be paid to grasping the time and focus, and there must be strong organization and leadership.

	Third: Conducting rectification through cadre meetings, party member representative meetings, and people's representative conferences from all walks of life. For example, in Fujian Province, due to the small number of cadres and heavy workload, it is impossible to spare a lot of time for rectification, so convening short-term cadre meetings is the main rectification method. Also, more than a dozen counties under the Taizhou Special District of Northern Jiangsu Province universally convened party member representative meetings. Through the meetings, they summarized the work of the spring and summer seasons, focusing on correcting commandism and opposing corruption and degeneration. At the same time, they also combined it with electing model workers. Responsible cadres of Fuyang County in Northern Anhui conducted work reviews through people's representative conferences from all walks of life, focusing on soliciting opinions and criticisms from representatives from all walks of life regarding the implementation of policies and work styles. This rectification method has the advantages of the previous two methods, but it must be coordinated with other rectification methods to concretely implement the spirit of the meeting into practical work.

	Responsible comrades making good rectification reports is the main condition for the smooth progress of the movement.

	In the three methods of rectification, the general approach is to read designated documents, summarize work, analyze the situation, and carry out criticism and self-criticism, unfolding from top to bottom level by level. At the beginning of the rectification, the responsible persons of the party committees of various regions or departments mostly made rectification reports with content, analysis, and typical examples, serving as the main materials for the rectification study in the region or department. In this way, it can make it easier for general cadres to understand how theory is combined with practice, and how the rectification movement is combined with various specific tasks, which has a great effect on the development of the rectification movement. Experience has proved that wherever such reports are made at the beginning of the rectification, the rectification movement can be smoothly unfolded. Conversely, if this is not done or the reports are not made in a timely manner, the rectification movement will take detours. For example, at the beginning of the first phase of rectification in the Northern Jiangsu District Party School, due to the leading cadres making rectification reports combined with practical work and first conducting self-criticism, adopting typical demonstration methods, the general cadres boldly exposed the bad work styles of bureaucracy and commandism in the study of documents and the summary of production relief, water control, grain requisition, and taxation over the past year, and actively carried out criticism and self-criticism, making the rectification movement progress smoothly. On the contrary, such as the Shanghai Railway Administration, due to the rectification report not being combined with the actual work of the bureau, and the leading cadres not setting a good example by first conducting self-criticism, the rectification work did not develop quickly. However, after correcting this shortcoming, the rectification movement of the bureau quickly advanced forward.

	Incorrect attitudes toward rectification should be analyzed and criticized in a timely manner.

	Before and at the very beginning of the rectification, some cadres had incorrect attitudes toward rectification. For example, some leading cadres said: "Work is already too busy, and we still have to carry out rectification, we can't handle it." Therefore, they neglected the leadership of the rectification movement. Among district and township cadres, there was insufficient understanding of the harm of commandism. Some cadres had such erroneous understandings at the beginning of the rectification, namely, believing that "in certain special circumstances, it is necessary to force orders to complete tasks" and "the masses in the new areas are backward, so we have to force orders"; at the same time, due to the many shortcomings and errors they have committed in their work, they have concerns about rectification, fearing that they will be punished in the rectification, so they avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, and dare not boldly review. Among organ cadres, the more common issue is that they do not pay enough attention to this rectification, believing that this rectification is to rectify bureaucracy on the leadership and commandism of lower-level cadres, and that they themselves are "neither up nor down, there is nothing to rectify," or that "the big storms have passed, what else is there to rectify." Due to the rectification mobilization carried out in various regions and departments after the start of the rectification, clearly explaining the rectification policy, and especially analyzing and criticizing the above-mentioned various erroneous views and attitudes, the above-mentioned erroneous ideas were quickly corrected.

### 华东各地整风运动普遍展开  各省市轮训干部准备进行土地改革

　　华东各地整风运动普遍展开
    各省市轮训干部准备进行土地改革
    【新华社上海十九日电】华东各地的整风运动已普遍展开。各省（区）、市党校第一期整风，大部已告结束；专区及县级的整风运动正在逐步展开。华东大行政区一级机关及上海、南京两市的整风运动，亦已于八月份开始。
    不论采取何种方式，均须注意联系实际，改进工作。
    这次整风运动，各地大致采取下列三种方式：
    第一：开办党校、训练班，抽调干部轮流集中整风。这些党校或训练班以训练土地改革的干部为主，一般由省（区）、专区、县分级训练。各级先训练一期，作为下一级轮训干部的工作骨干。土地改革工作队的干部亦同时参加受训。每期大约以三分之二或二分之一时间整风，另以三分之一或二分之一时间学习土地改革政策。据浙江、皖北、皖南、苏北、苏南各省（区）第一期党校统计：受训的党员干部已有五千三百四十八人。这种整风方式的优点是：时间容易掌握，领导容易贯彻。缺点是：脱离工作单位，联系实际较差，群众方面的意见难于搜集；在这一方面，须有其他的办法予以补助。
    第二：在职整风。县以上的各机关及城市工作干部，均以在职整风为主。方法是：按工作部门或工作系统总结工作，整顿作风。浙江省整风领导机关并规定可按各单位具体情况分别先后整风。这种整风方式的优点是：能与当前的工作任务密切结合，一面整风，一面改进工作。但在采取这种方式整风时，要注意掌握时间和重点，并须有坚强的组织和领导。
    第三是：通过干部会议、党员代表会议及各界人民代表会议进行整风。如福建省因干部少、工作任务重，不可能抽出很多时间进行整风，即以召开短期的干部会议为主要整风方式。又如苏北泰州专区所属十余个县，普遍召开了党员代表会，通过会议，总结春夏两季的工作，着重纠正命令主义作风和反对贪污腐化现象，同时并结合选举模范工作者，皖北阜阳县负责干部通过各界人民代表会议，进行了工作检讨，并着重在执行政策和工作作风方面，听取各界代表的意见和批评。这种整风方式兼有前两种方式的优点，但必须与其他各种整风方式互相配合，以求把会议的精神具体贯彻到实际工作中去。
    负责同志作好整风报告，是运动顺利进展的主要条件。
    三种方式的整风，一般都是采取阅读指定文件，总结工作，分析情况，开展批评与自我批评的方法，由上而下地逐级展开。整风开始时，各地区或各部门的党委负责人，大都作了有内容、有分析、有典型实例的整风报告，作为该地区或该部门的整风学习的主要材料。这样，可以使一般干部易于懂得理论如何与实际相结合，整风运动如何与各项具体工作相结合，对整风运动的开展有很大的作用。经验证明：凡是在整风开始时作了这样的报告的地方，整风运动就能顺利地展开，反之，没有这样作或是报告作得不及时的，整风运动就走了弯路。如苏北区党校第一期整风开始时，由于领导干部作了结合实际工作的整风报告并首先进行检讨，采取典型示范的方法，一般干部在学习文件和总结一年来生产救灾、治水、征粮和税收等工作中就大胆揭露了工作中的官僚主义与命令主义的不良作风，积极展开批评与自我批评，使整风运动顺利进展。相反，如上海铁路管理局，由于整风报告没有和该局实际工作结合，同时领导干部没有很好地、以身作则地首先进行自我检讨，整风工作开展不快。但在纠正这一缺点后，该局的整风运动就很快地向前推进了。
    对整风的不正确的态度，应及时进行分析和批判。
    在整风开始前和刚开始时，部分干部对整风存在着不正确的态度。如有些领导干部说：“工作已经太忙，又要整风，搞不了。”因此，他们忽视了对整风运动的领导。在区、乡干部中，对命令主义的危害性认识不够。某些干部在开始整风时曾有这类的错误认识，即认为“在某些特殊情况下，必须强迫命令才能完成任务”以及“新区群众落后，只好强迫命令”等；同时，又由于他们在工作中所犯的缺点和错误较多，他们对整风抱有顾虑，怕在整风中受到处分，因而避重就轻，不敢大胆检讨。在机关干部方面，较普遍的是对这次整风不够重视，认为这次整风是整领导上的官僚主义和下级干部的命令主义，自己“不上不下，没有什么可整的”，或者认为“大风大浪也过来了，还有什么可整的”。以上这种错误的思想，由于整风开始后，各地区、各部门都进行了整风动员，明确地说明了整风方针，特别是针对以上各种错误的看法和态度，进行了分析和批判，很快地得到了纠正。
