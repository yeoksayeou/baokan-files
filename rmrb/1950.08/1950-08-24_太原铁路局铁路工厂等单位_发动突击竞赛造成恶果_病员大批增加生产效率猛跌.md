　　Taiyuan Railway Bureau Railway Factory and Other Units
    Launch Rush Competitions, Causing Bad Consequences
    Large Increase in Sick Workers, Sharp Drop in Production Efficiency
    [Our Newspaper News] Workers' Daily News: In the production competitions of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, Railway Factory, and other units in May and June, there was a tendency towards reckless adventurism. As a result of simply increasing labor intensity, the number of sick workers in each factory increased significantly after the competition, and production efficiency dropped sharply. The Taiyuan Telecommunications Section advocated "storm-like rush work" in May and June, calling on employees to work as usual on Sundays without overtime pay. The Vehicle Section of the Taiyuan Machine Factory, in order to win the title of "Model," called on workers to work voluntary overtime. Some units did not even provide sufficient time for meals, and also called on everyone to take as little sick leave as possible during the competition. Overtime work in the Taiyuan Telecommunications Section in May and June accounted for 15.2% of the total attendance. The result of such a competition was, of course, very bad. In the Machine Workshop of the Taiyuan Machine Factory, with a total of 233 people, 69 were on sick leave, accounting for more than 29% of the total, most of which was caused by the hot weather, busy work, inability to eat and drink properly, and overwork. Zhao Wanyi, a worker in the Taiyuan Telecommunications Section, was strong and healthy before the competition, but during the competition, due to the leaders' encouragement of workers to simply increase labor intensity, he is now in poor health, coughing and panting all day long. The Tainan Vehicle Inspection Section had six more responsibility faults in June than in May (including one responsibility accident). This kind of competition has led to the deformed development of work and has damaged the normal labor of workers. For example, after the production competitions in May and June in the Taiyuan Machine Factory and Tainan Railway Station, the workers' production enthusiasm generally decreased. The work efficiency of the machinists' group in the Machine Workshop of the Taiyuan Machine Factory decreased by 20% in July; although the Manufacturing and Repair Workshop exceeded the task by 40% in the competition, it only completed 42% of the task by the 26th of July; the Vehicle Section produced 35 vehicles by the 25th of June, and only 17 vehicles by the 25th of July, a decrease in production efficiency of more than 50%. Workers generally want to "rest" and "take a breath." Workers in the Riveting Workshop said, "If we compete for two more months, everyone will get sick!" Some workers also said that because there were no rewards, "The knife handle is in our hands. In the future, if we are mobilized to work like this, we will never put in so much effort again." The number of people on sick leave in the Nanjian Section in July was equal to 142% of the number of people on sick leave in June. This kind of competition has also caused huge losses to the machines. For example, in the Taiyuan Machine Factory, even the leaking workshops could not be repaired during the competition. When it rained, the electric rollers worked immersed in water. Every time it rained, one-third of all the belts in the Machine Workshop were lost. This greatly shortened the life of the machines.
    The emergence of this tendency towards reckless adventurism is mainly due to the fact that some cadres in the bureau have misunderstood production competitions and have championship-ism ideas. A cadre in the South Station said, "Competition is like a battle, and after the battle, we rest." Therefore, in the competition, they desperately encouraged workers to increase labor intensity, formulated overly high production plans, and single-mindedly pursued numbers. Another reason is that the work is not in-depth and lacks organization in production. The leading cadres of the Taiyuan Machine Factory also proposed "rational use of labor" and "conducting production competitions under normal working conditions" during the competition, but they did not conduct in-depth inspections and did not promptly stop the championship-ism ideas of some cadres, allowing some cadres to order workers to process voluntarily. The Machine Workshop of the factory even wrote on the announcement ordering workers to process voluntarily: "Those who do not process will be treated as absenteeism."
    Editor's Note: The production competition deviation of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau and Railway Factory and other units is to regard production competition as a blitz movement. Therefore, they advocate "storm-like" blitz work and believe that "competition is like a battle, and after the battle, we rest!" This is completely wrong. Industrial production is continuous and there is no distinction between "busy work" and "idle work". In order to ensure the completion of the national production plan, we should strengthen the continuous education of workers, improve their political awareness, improve production management and production organization, and establish and improve various production systems. Mistakenly treating competition as a blitz task, simply increasing labor intensity and pursuing numbers, will inevitably harm workers' health, and the result will inevitably lead to reduced product quality, damaged machines, and serious waste of raw materials, causing significant losses to production. This kind of bias in units such as the Taiyuan Railway Bureau is still a fairly common phenomenon nationwide. Therefore, this lesson should not only be well remembered by the Taiyuan Railway Bureau and other units; trade union organizations and trade union cadres throughout the country, as well as the competent authorities of local enterprises and administrative cadres in charge of production, should also learn from this.

### 太原铁路局铁路工厂等单位  发动突击竞赛造成恶果  病员大批增加生产效率猛跌

　　太原铁路局铁路工厂等单位
    发动突击竞赛造成恶果
    病员大批增加生产效率猛跌
    【本报讯】工人日报消息：太原铁路局、铁路工厂等单位在五、六月份生产竞赛中，犯了拚命主义的偏向，由于单纯加强劳动强度的结果，竞赛后各厂病员大增，生产率猛降。太原电务段在五、六月份提倡“狂风暴雨般的突击工作”，号召职工星期日照常工作，不要加班费。太原机厂车辆所为了争取“模范”，号召工人加义务工，甚至有的单位连吃饭都不给充足时间，还号召大家在竞赛期间少请病假。太原电务段五、六月份的加班加点占应出勤总数的百分之十五·二。这样的竞赛结果，当然是很糟的。太原机厂机工所总人数是二百三十三人，请病假的就有六十九人，占总人数的百分之二十九强，其中大部分是因为天气热，工作忙，不得好好吃喝和劳累过度所造成的。太原电务段工人赵万亿在竞赛前体强力壮，在竞赛中由于领导上鼓励工人单纯提高劳动强度，现在弄得身体很糟，整日咳嗽气喘。太南检车段六月份比五月份增加了六件责任故障（内有一件责任事故）。这种竞赛造成了工作的畸形发展，损害了工人的正常劳动。如太原机厂及太南北站各单位五、六月生产竞赛后，工人生产情绪普遍降低。太原机厂机工所机工组的工作效率，七月份降低了百分之二十；制修所在竞赛中虽然超过了任务百分之四十，但是七月份到二十六日止，才完成了任务的百分之四十二；车辆所六月份到二十五日出车三十五辆，七月份到二十五日才出车十七辆，生产效率减低了百分之五十还多。工人中普遍想“歇一歇”、“松一口气”。铆工所工人说：“再竞赛两个月，人们全得生了病！”有的工人又因为没有奖励，说：“刀把子在咱手里，今后这样动员着干，可再也不费大劲了。”南检段七月份请病假人数，等于六月份请病假人数的百分之一百四十二。这种竞赛同样也使机器遭到巨大的损失，如太原机厂在竞赛中连破漏的工房都顾不上修，下雨时电滚子浸在水中工作，每下一次雨，要损失机工所全部皮带的三分之一。这样大大缩短了机器的寿命。
    这种拚命主义偏向的产生，主要是由于该局一些干部对生产竞赛认识错了，存有锦标主义思想。南站一个干部说：“竞赛如战斗，战斗完了就休整。”所以在竞赛中就拚命鼓励工人加强劳动强度，制订了过高的生产计划，一股劲的追求数字。另外一种是由于工作不深入，对生产缺乏组织性，太原机厂的领导干部在竞赛时也曾提出“合理使用劳动力”，“在正常工作状态下进行生产竞赛”，可是他们并没有深入的检查，没有及时的制止某些干部的锦标主义思想，听任某些干部命令工人义务加工，该厂机工所竟在命令工人义务加工的布告上，写着：“不加工的，按旷工处理。”
    编者按：太原铁路局和铁路工厂等单位的生产竞赛偏向，是把生产竞赛当成了突击运动，因此他们提倡“狂风暴雨般的”突击工作，认为“竞赛如战斗，战斗完了就休整！”这是完全错误的。工业生产是经常性的，没有“工忙”与“工闲”之分。为了保证完成国家生产计划，应该加强对工人的经常教育，提高其政治觉悟，改进生产管理、生产组织，建立与健全各种生产制度。错误地把竞赛当作突击任务，单纯地增加劳动强度和追逐数字，势必损害工人健康，结果必然造成降低产品质量、损坏机器、严重地浪费原材料，使生产受到重大损失。像太原铁路局等单位的这种偏向，在全国范围内，目前还是一种相当普遍的现象。因此，这一教训，不仅太原铁路局等单位应很好记取；全国各地的工会组织与工会干部，以及各地企业主管机关和管理生产的行政干部也应该从这里得到教训。
