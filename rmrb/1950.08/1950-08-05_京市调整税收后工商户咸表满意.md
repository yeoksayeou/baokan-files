[Beijing News Agency] Since the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Taxation began adjusting Beijing's taxes on July 1, in accordance with the resolutions and spirit of the National Taxation Conference, in addition to the partial revisions made to the tax items and rates according to the instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, there have also been great improvements in the collection methods, and general industrial and commercial households have expressed satisfaction.

After the tax items and tax rates were revised, the collection of taxes on 437 items was stopped, and the tax rates for 67 types were merged or reduced; the stamp tax was reduced from 30 items to 25 items, of which the commercial certificate part, except for invoices which are taxed at a rate of 3 per thousand, the others are affixed on a per-item basis; the transaction tax is only levied in exchanges and markets with brokers, and other seated merchants, cooperatives, and direct transactions are exempt from taxation.

In terms of collection methods, a step has been taken beyond the previous simple democratic tax assessment method. Now, it is divided into three types according to whether industrial and commercial households have sound accounts: 1. For industrial and commercial households with sound accounting systems, the method of "self-reporting, auditing accounts, and calculating taxes according to the rate" can be adopted. Business tax is collected quarterly, and income tax is estimated and collected semi-annually, and the final settlement is based on the accounts at the end of the year, with refunds for overpayments and supplements for underpayments. 2. For business tax of businesses that have accounting books but have unsound accounting systems, business tax is assessed quarterly based on "self-reporting, public discussion, democratic assessment, auditing accounts, and calculating taxes according to the rate". Income tax will be assessed either by democratic assessment or auditing accounts, estimated semi-annually, and settled at the end of the year. The business tax part that adopts the above two methods will gradually move from quarterly assessment to monthly assessment. 3. For industrial and commercial households without accounts or with inaccurate accounts, business tax and income tax are collected together. Each household self-reports, democratically assesses, or negotiates and determines the monthly tax payable, which is paid quarterly first, and gradually moves towards monthly payment. The above three methods are used separately according to different specific circumstances, which on the one hand basically overcomes the inaccuracy of the past simple democratic assessment and the phenomenon of uneven burdens; on the other hand, it also avoids the difficulty of concentrated tax payment for industrial and commercial households in the past, and enables industrial and commercial households to prepare tax payments in advance according to their own accounts and fixed tax amounts, strengthening planned operation.

In terms of goods tax, the Tax Bureau is also simplifying the goods inspection procedures, changing to manufacturers affixing their own inspection certificates, and tax bureau staff going to the factory and inventory to supervise the affixing, in order to save the manufacturers' transportation costs and time consumption required to transport goods to the Tax Bureau for inspection.

　　京市调整税收后工商户咸表满意
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府税务局根据全国税务会议的决议与精神，自七月一日开始调整京市税收以来，除在税目、税率上，按照中央财经委员会的指示，已经作了部分的修正外，在征收方法上也有了很大改进，一般工商业户都表示满意。
    税目税率修正后，货物税停止征收的计四百三十七件，合并征收或减低税率的有六十七种；印花税由三十目减为二十五目，其中商业凭证部分，除发货票依率按千分之三计征外，其他均按件贴花；交易税只在交易所及有牙纪之集市市场中征收，其他座商，合作社及直接成交者均免征。
    在征收方法上，较过去单纯民主评议税分的方法提高了一步，现在是按照工商户有无健全账目分为三种：一、凡工商户会计制度健全的，可以采用“自报查账依率计征”的方法。营业税按季征收，所得税率半年估征一次，年终按账结算，多退少补。二、虽有账簿但会计制度不健全的营业税每季按“自报公议民主评定，查账依率计征”，所得税将来分别采取民主评议或查账计征，半年估征一次，年终结算。采用以上两种办法的营业税部分，将来能由每季计征，逐渐走向按月计征。三、凡无账或账目不确实的工商户，营业税及所得税合并征收，由各户自报民主评定或协商规定每月应纳税额，先按季缴纳，逐渐走向按月缴纳。以上三种办法根据具体情况不同分别使用，一方面基本上克服了过去单纯民主评议的不精确性及负担畸轻畸重的现象；另一方面也避免了过去工商业户集中缴纳税款的困难，并使工商业户能根据自己的账目及固定税额预先准备税款，加强计划性的经营。
    在货物税方面，税务局也正简化货物查验手续，改由厂商自贴查验证，税局工作人员到厂及存货处监贴，以节省厂商运货到税局去待验所需的运费及时间上的消耗。
