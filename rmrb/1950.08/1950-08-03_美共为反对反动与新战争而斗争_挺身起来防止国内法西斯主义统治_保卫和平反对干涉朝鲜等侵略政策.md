Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th (TASS): Ilin published an essay in *Pravda* entitled "The Communist Party of the United States Struggles Against Reaction and New War." The author wrote: The American rulers, pursuing the evil policy of launching a new war and inciting war hysteria, have organized an attack on the democratic rights of American workers and their progressive organizations. This reactionary offensive is primarily aimed at the Communist Party of the United States. The reactionary authorities in the United States have inflicted one blow after another on it. They have deprived the advanced representatives of the people of their freedom and trampled on the last remnants of so-called American democracy.

　　The victim and heroic son of the American people, CPUSA General Secretary Dennis, has been suffering in a New York prison since May 12.

　　In Congress, reactionary ringleaders are particularly concerned with "perfecting" some laws aimed at suppressing even the slightest opposition from the people to the predatory plans of American imperialism. They are taking advantage of the American imperialist aggression in Korea to try to rapidly pass the fascist Mundt Bill. The anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act places trade union organizations of the working class under police control, while the Mundt Bill is used to outlaw the Communist Party and all progressive organizations fighting for peace and democracy. Under the guise of an "emergency situation," reactionaries have carried out wanton searches of progressive organizations. Immediately after Dennis, dozens of American progressive intellectuals were imprisoned, including the famous writer Fast, the outstanding American screenwriter Lawson, and others.

　　This entire campaign of atrocities and club law is being carried out under the "anti-communist" slogan borrowed from defeated German fascism. The American reactionaries, in carrying out their anti-democratic campaign, are first attacking the Communist Party of the United States because it is the vanguard of the growing peace and democratic movement and urges the American working people to rise up against war and imperialist reactionaries.

　　Reflecting the true aspirations of the American working class and progressive forces, the Communist Party is now bravely exposing the military intervention in Korea and other countries in the Far East, standing up to prevent fascist rule at home, and striving for lasting peace and the democratic rights of the American people. Regardless of threats and terror, Communist leaders and party members are conveying the truth to the masses, warning them to beware of the growing danger of a new war being launched by the American ruling class. Communists condemn the U.S. government's plans for aggression and plunder: the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and the North Atlantic Treaty. Communists demand the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, Truman's "loyalty" investigation order for citizens, and the abolition of the House's fascist "Un-American" Activities Committee. They put forward a program for the democratic transformation of the American social system, opposition to fascism, and the implementation of a policy of cooperation with the Soviet Union.

　　Ilin pointed out that no one can deny that these demands are in line with the vital interests of the American people. However, the enemies of peace and democracy fear that the American people will adopt this peace program, and they are further intensifying their suppression of the most progressive party in the United States, the Communist Party. Pursuits and persecutions, detective work and slanderous court trials have become common methods in the policy of suppressing the Communist Party.

　　In 1949, the American rulers fabricated a shameful trial of eleven Communist leaders.

　　This trial once again powerfully confirmed an irrefutable conclusion: no terror, no fascist laws can, and will not, frustrate the fighting spirit and will of the Communist Party of the United States in its struggle. Deeply convinced of the strength of the Communist Party and the democratic spirit and traditions of the American working class and ordinary people, the eleven Communist leaders declared after their sentences were announced: The Communist Party will continue its work and will intensify its struggle for the interests of the working people, for peace, freedom and social progress.

　　What is the source of this belief in the strength of the American communist movement? The source of this belief is: they recognize that the Communist Party upholds justice. The Party has cultivated its own awareness based on the true science created by Marx and Engels more than a hundred years ago and developed in our time by their great successors, Lenin and Stalin.

　　The masses of people who yearn for peace and abhor war see the Communists as saviors who protect them from the horrors of a new war. On the other hand, in the imperialist system, the masses see the source of endless wars, panics, unemployment and poverty. In the face of this clear truth, all the courts and police organs of American imperialism, and all the words of their hired writers and lawyers, appear powerless.

　　The Communist Party of the United States, headed by Foster, upholds the cause of the working class and wages an irreconcilable struggle against this group of traitors who betray the interests of the working people. That is why progressive people in the United States, regardless of religious or political beliefs, have risen up to defend the Communist Party of the United States.

　　This movement is currently manifested in the struggle of progressive forces to rescue Dennis, demand the cancellation of the sentences against the eleven CPUSA leaders, and strive to defeat the fascist Mundt Bill. Workers at the Ford Motor Company in Detroit, black laborers in Harlem, writers, scientists, and artists have protested the imprisonment of Dennis.

　　The sympathy and support of American progressives and working people around the world for the Communist Party gives the Communist Party greater strength and strengthens their confidence in the just cause to which they are dedicated. They continue to fight with greater strength to defend the interests of the masses.

　　Ilin concluded by saying: Regardless of the persecution of the Party's leaders and the means of interrogation and police suppression, the Communist Party of the United States bravely and resolutely stands up to defend peace, oppose intervention in Korea, and oppose the entire robber policy of American imperialism. The Communist Party of the United States is fighting for this great and just cause, and is therefore also defending the true interests of the American people.

### 美共为反对反动与新战争而斗争  挺身起来防止国内法西斯主义统治  保卫和平反对干涉朝鲜等侵略政策

　　美共为反对反动与新战争而斗争
    挺身起来防止国内法西斯主义统治
    保卫和平反对干涉朝鲜等侵略政策
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三十日电：伊林顷在真理报发表论文，题为《美国共产党为反对反动与新战争而斗争》。作者写道：美国统治者奉行着发动新战争及煽起战争歇斯底里的罪恶政策，已组织了对美国工人的民主权利及他们的进步组织的进攻。这个反动的进攻，首先针对着美国共产党。美国的反动当局把一个又一个的打击加在它的身上。他们剥夺了人民的先进代表的自由，蹂躏了最后残余的一点所谓美国民主。
    受害者及美国人民的英勇的儿子美共总书记但尼斯，自五月十二日以来即在纽约监狱受摧残。
    在国会中，反动头目特别关切使一些旨在压制人民对美帝国主义掠夺计划的任何一点点反对的法律“臻于完美”。他们乘美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的机会，企图急速通过法西斯的蒙特法案。反劳工的塔夫脱——哈特莱法案将工人阶级的工会组织置于警察管制之下，而蒙特法案则是用来使为和平与民主而斗争的共产党及一切进步组织成为非法。反动派在“紧急情况”的掩饰下，对进步组织进行了肆无忌惮的搜捕。紧接在但尼斯之后，数十位美国进步知识分子被关进监牢，包括著名作家法斯特，卓越的美国电影脚本作家劳森及其他等。
    整个这个暴行与棍棒法律运动是在从已被打垮的德国法西斯主义那里借来的“反共”口号下展开的。美国反动派在进行反民主的运动时，首先进攻美国共产党，因为它是日益增长的和平民主运动的先锋，而且敦促美国劳动人民起来反对战争和帝国主义反动派。
    共产党反映美国工人阶级和进步力量的真正愿望，现在正在勇敢地揭露对朝鲜和远东其他国家的军事干涉，挺身起来防止国内法西斯主义的统治，争取持久和平和美国人民的民主权利。不顾威胁与恐怖，共产党的领袖们和党员们向人民群众传达真理，警告他们提防美国的统治阶级所正在发动新战争的日益增长的危险。共产党人斥责美国政府的侵略和掠夺计划：杜鲁门主义、马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约。共产党人要求取销塔夫脱——哈特莱法案，杜鲁门的公民“忠诚”调查命令，取消众院的法西斯的“非美”活动委员会。他们提出民主改造美国社会制度，反对法西斯主义和实行对苏合作政策的纲领。
    伊林指出，没有人能够否认，这些要求是符合美国人民切身利益的。不过，和平与民主的敌人害怕美国人民采纳这个和平的纲领，他们正在进一步加紧对美国最进步的政党共产党的镇压。追缉与迫害，侦探与诬陷的法院审判，已经成为镇压共产党的政策中的普通方法了。
    一九四九年，美国的统治者制造了对于十一位共产党领袖的可耻审判。
    这种审判再一度有力地证实了一个无可辩驳的结论：任何恐怖，任何法西斯法律都不能，也不会挫折美国共产党在斗争中的战斗精神和意志。十一位共产党领袖深信共产党的力量，深信美国工人阶级与普通人民的民主精神与传统在他们的判决宣布以后即声明：共产党将继续其工作，将为劳动人民群众的利益，为和平自由与社会进步而加紧斗争。
    这种对于美国共产主义运动之力量的信念，其源泉是什么呢？这一信念的源泉是：他们认识到共产党维护正义。党根据一百多年前马克思与恩格斯创造的而在我们这个时期又为他们的伟大承继者列宁与斯大林加以发展的真正科学，锻炼出自己的觉悟性。
    渴望和平，厌恶战争的人民大众把共产党人看做是保卫他们免受新战争恐怖的救星。另方面，在帝国主义制度中，群众看到无穷无尽的战争、恐慌，失业与贫困的根源。在这一明白的真理面前，美帝国主义的一切法庭与警察机关，他们雇用的文人与律师的一切言辞都显得毫无力量了。
    以福斯特为首的美国共产党维护工人阶级的事业，对这批出卖劳动人民利益的叛徒进行不可调和的斗争。这就是为什么美国进步人民不分宗教信仰与政治信仰一起起来保卫美国共产党的原因。
    这个运动目前表现在进步力量营救但尼斯，要求取消对十一位美共领袖的判决和争取击败法西斯的蒙特法案的斗争中。底特律的福特汽车公司的工人、哈莱姆的黑人劳动者、作家、科学家与艺术家已在抗议监禁但尼斯。
    美国进步分子与全世界劳动人民对共产党的同情与支持，使美国共产党获得更大的力量，并加强了他们对他们所献身的正义事业的信心。他们继续用更大的力量进行保卫人民群众的利益的斗争。
    伊林最后说：不顾对党的领袖施加的迫害及审讯与警察镇压手段，美国共产党英勇地与坚决地挺身保卫和平，反对干涉朝鲜与美国帝国主义的整个强盗政策。美国共产党为这个伟大的和正义的事业进行斗争，因此也是在保卫美国人民的真正利益。
