Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th - Comprehensive dispatch from the Korean Central News Agency: Since the beginning of Korea's Fatherland Liberation War, more than 1.3 million Korean youths have signed up for the army. At the same time, large numbers of Korean women have left cities and villages, schools and homes, and entered various production departments such as factories and mines, taking over the work of those who have joined the army to ensure the completion of rear production tasks. They are exceeding their production quotas every day with high patriotic enthusiasm. Korean women are also actively working to donate "Women's Aircraft" and tanks. The women of Wonsan, which suffered the most damage from American bombing, decided at a meeting of women from all walks of life held on July 25 to denounce the atrocities of the US military to do everything possible to support the front lines and avenge their hatred, and decided to donate a Wonsan "Women's Aircraft" to the front lines by August 13. Female workers, farmers, female staff members, and housewives have all actively responded to this call by contributing their extra labor income, bonuses, crops, part of their salaries, and precious metals. The movement to donate "Women's Aircraft" is rapidly spreading throughout Gangwon Province, North Pyongan Province, and South Hamgyong Province.
