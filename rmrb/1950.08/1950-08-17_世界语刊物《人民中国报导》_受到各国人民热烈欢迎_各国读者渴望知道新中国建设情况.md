[Report from Our Newspaper] The Esperanto international propaganda monthly "People's China Reports," published by the Beijing Foreign Languages Press, has received a positive response from readers in various countries since its inaugural issue in May of this year. Over the past month, the Press has received letters from readers in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, as well as Finland, Sweden, Indonesia, Japan, and the United States, expressing warm sympathy for the new China and a desire to learn more about the economic and cultural construction of the new China, as well as the living conditions of the general population. They have read the contents of the publication in worker and youth groups, introduced the publication in newspapers and periodicals, and translated articles from it.

Based on the feedback already received, the article "May Day in China," which was published in the first issue, has been abridged and translated into Finnish and published in the Finnish democratic newspaper "New Era" on June 21st. The article "Workers Vigorously Build New China" by Comrade Liu Ningyi has been abridged and published in the Slovak newspaper "Labor News" (June 17th) in Czechoslovakia, which also included Gu Yuan's woodcut "Anshan Iron and Steel Works in Recovery" as an illustration. The Finnish "New Era" newspaper also published an article based on this material on June 29th. The Finnish "New Era" newspaper published an abridged translation of the article "The Rebirth of Prostitutes After the Liberation of Beijing" on June 30th. The article "Beggar Becomes District Chief" has been translated and published in the organ of the Japanese Communist Party Mie Prefectural Committee, "New Mie," on June 14th. Zhao Shuli's novel "Widow Tian Watches the Melon" has already been translated in two versions, published in the Slovak "Labor News" (June 10th) and the Japanese Communist Party's "Red Flag Weekly" (July 3rd), respectively. "The New-Style Farmers' Hostel in Shijiazhuang" was translated in full and published in the Bulgarian newspaper "Farmers' Banner" on July 5th.

In addition, readers' letters also suggest that the publication introduce more construction experiences and the general life of the people in the new China. In terms of cultural exchange, readers also hope that this publication can assume more tasks. Chala Pusky, the translator of the Slovak version of "Selected Lu Xun Novels," requested the editors of "People's China Reports" to seek the consent of Lu Xun's widow for the publication of the translated manuscript. Bulgarian writers hope to establish contact with Chinese literary and art workers through this publication. The founder of a Czech "World Workers' Struggle Traveling Exhibition" hopes that the publication will provide some exhibition materials for it.

Recently, the publication also received a joint letter from 229 workers from the United Iron and Steel Works in Pestszentlőrinc, Hungary, paying tribute to the People's Liberation Army on the anniversary of the founding of the army. The Preparatory Committee of the Esperanto Society of the All-Japan Electrical Industry Labor Union also entrusted the publication to forward a letter to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, paying respects.

　　世界语刊物《人民中国报导》
    受到各国人民热烈欢迎
    各国读者渴望知道新中国建设情况
    【本报讯】北京外文出版社出版的世界语的国际宣传月刊《人民中国报导》，自本年五月创刊以来，得到各国读者的良好反响。一个多月来，该社收到来自捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、以至芬兰、瑞典、印尼、日本和美国的许多读者的来信，表示对新中国热烈的同情，并且渴望知道更多的新中国经济与文化建设的情况，以及一般人民的生活状况。他们在工人和青年团体中，宣读该刊的内容，在报纸刊物上介绍了该刊的出版，并译载其中的文章。
    根据现在已经收到的反响，该刊第一期所载《五一在中国》已被节译为芬兰文，刊载于六月二十一日芬兰的民主报纸《新时代》上；刘宁一同志所作《工人大力建设新中国》一文，已在捷克的斯洛伐克文报纸《劳动报》（六月十七日）节译刊登，该报并将古元木刻“鞍山钢铁厂在恢复中”刊入作为插图；芬兰新时代报也于六月二十九日发表了根据这个材料编写的文章。芬兰《新时代》报于六月三十日发表了《北京解放后妓女的新生》一文的节译。《乞丐做了区长》一文已译载于六月十四日日本三重县日共县委会的机关刊物《新三重》上。赵树理的小说《田寡妇看瓜》已经有两种译文，分别发表在斯洛伐克的《劳动报》（六月十日）和日共的《赤旗周报》上（七月三日）。《石家庄的新式农民招待所》已于七月五日全文译载于保加利亚的《农民旗帜》报上。
    此外，读者来信中还建议该刊多多介绍建设经验和新中国人民的一般生活。在文化交流的工作上，读者也希望这个刊物能担负更多的任务。斯洛伐克文《鲁迅小说选》的译者查拉蒲斯基要求《人民中国报导》的编者，代为征求鲁迅夫人对出版该译稿的同意，保加利亚的作家们希望通过这个刊物，能和中国的文节工作者建立联系。捷克一个《世界工人斗争巡回展览会》的创办者，希望该刊供给它一些展览材料。
    最近该刊又接到匈牙利佩斯孙特赛培特地方联合钢铁厂工友二百二十九人联名来信，在我国建军节向人民解放军致敬。全日本电气工业劳动组合世界语学会筹备委员会也委托该刊转信向英勇的中国人民解放军致敬。（张企程）
