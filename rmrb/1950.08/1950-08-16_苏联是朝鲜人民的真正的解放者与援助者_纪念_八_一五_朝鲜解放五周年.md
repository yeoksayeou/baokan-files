The Soviet Union is the True Liberator and Helper of the Korean People
    —Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the "August 15th" Liberation of Korea
    By Kim Song-yong, Director of the China General Branch of the Korean Central News Agency

　　On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union declared a state of war against Japan. Under the heroic advance of the Soviet army, the Kwantung Army, boasted by Japanese imperialism, was annihilated in a short period. Only a week after the declaration of war, on August 15, Japan surrendered unconditionally.

　　Before the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan, Japan was still fantasizing about favorable war results and determined to continue the long-term war, having rejected the demands of the United States, Britain, and China for Japan's unconditional surrender. It was precisely because the Soviet Union participated in the war against Japan and the decisive role it played in the war against Japan that Japanese imperialism was eliminated in the East, and the Eastern nations were able to obtain peace and liberation.

　　Thanks to the great victory of the Soviet army, on August 15, 1945, our motherland was liberated from the brutal rule of Japanese imperialism, which had lasted for half a century.

　　The Soviet army, which upheld the independence and freedom of small and weak nations, provided the Korean people with all possibilities and assistance for independent development and democratic progress from the first day it entered North Korea. In order to make the Korean people the masters of their own country in political, economic, and cultural aspects, the Soviet army transferred all political power to the Korean people and provided conditions for various democratic reforms.

　　However, one month after the Japanese army was decisively defeated and surrendered by the Soviet army, the American army, which landed in South Korea, appeared from the first day as the new ruler of South Korea. They did not transfer political power to the people, but kept it in their own hands, depriving the Korean people of political freedom and rights. They colluded with pro-Japanese national traitors and implemented a colonial policy. Thus, for a long period of five years, the American rulers and their puppet gangs continued their barbarous fascist dark rule in South Korea. The U.S. imperialists sabotaged the work of the Soviet-American Joint Commission, the only international agreement to rebuild Korea into a democratic, unified, and independent state, namely the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference decision, and rejected the most legitimate proposal made by the Soviet Union for the simultaneous withdrawal of troops from both countries. Not only that, but the U.S. imperialists also launched their vassal states in the United Nations to fabricate the so-called "United Nations Korean Commission" and sent it to South Korea to carry out a traitorous separate election that ran counter to the will of the Korean people by means of terror and massacre, creating a puppet government of pro-Japanese elements and reactionary bandits. This was an attempt to fix the division of Korea at the 38th parallel, establish a fascist gendarme rule in South Korea, and permanently make Korea an American base of aggression in the Far East.

　　Under the favorable conditions provided by the Soviet army, North Korea implemented land reform and a series of other democratic reforms. As a result of the land reform, the peasant masses, who accounted for 80 percent of the total population and were groaning under feudal shackles, were liberated. The output of agricultural products increased significantly, and the lives of the peasants improved accordingly, creating conditions for the development of national industry.

　　In order to help the backward rural economy of Korea and popularize advanced agricultural technology, the Soviet Union sent a large number of agricultural technicians and scholars to provide material assistance in agricultural improvement. From 1949, agricultural machinery rental stations were established in important agricultural production areas in North Korea, opening the way for the mechanization of agriculture. In this way, the liberated North Korean peasants became a great force in the construction of the motherland, and North Korea changed from a grain-deficient area to a grain-sufficient area.

　　After the Soviet army entered North Korea, it handed over 1,034 industrial enterprises and other facilities in the hands of the Japanese imperialists to the Korean people, providing conditions for the implementation of important industrial nationalization; and gave full assistance in various ways in order to restore the nineteen power plants and three hundred mines and enterprises that were completely or largely destroyed by the Japanese imperialists when they were defeated. Soviet experts directly educated unskilled Korean technicians, helping us restore and improve enterprises. They guided us in building automobile repair plants, machine plants, and producing coke, steel, rayon, and other industries on the basis of the destroyed military factories.

　　The Soviet Union also provided great assistance in restoring the transportation industry, which had been paralyzed by the destruction of Japanese imperialism. For example, the Soviet army repaired 5,000 unusable vehicles and sent excellent experts to establish a transportation system. The Soviet Union provided us with enormous technical and material assistance in the recovery and development of the people's economy and in national planning. In particular, according to the "Agreement between Korea and the Soviet Union on Economic and Cultural Assistance" concluded in March 1949, our republic's two-year people's economic plan (1949-1950) was guaranteed to be successfully completed. According to this agreement, our republic received a loan of 222 million rubles from the Soviet Union within three years, and received technical and cultural assistance in various aspects such as economic and cultural development and the training of national cadres. The agreement between Korea and the Soviet Union on economic and cultural assistance, signed on the principle of equality and mutual assistance, has great significance for the future prosperity and development of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

　　The trade volume between Korea and the Soviet Union increased by 459.8 percent in 1949 compared to 1946, of which the import of machinery and raw materials necessary for economic recovery and agricultural development accounted for 66.8 percent. This fact is sufficient to show the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to the democratic development of our republic.

　　The Soviet Union has also provided enormous assistance in the cultural development of our republic. Many films, publications, and Soviet art have been introduced to Korea. Cultural and artistic delegations have traveled back and forth frequently. Advanced Soviet culture has played a great role in the development of Korean culture. The Soviet Union helped us establish an education system in the northern half, and sent hundreds of students to the Soviet Union, and sent teacher inspection groups to the Soviet Union to study Soviet educational theory and methods. In this way, the Soviet Union has also provided enormous assistance to the development of Korean education.

　　In order to develop the health care cause in North Korea, the Soviet Union has sent doctors and scholars, and supplied medicines, medical equipment, and sent epidemic prevention teams and installed medical equipment.

　　Thanks to the Soviet Union's enormous assistance in economic, cultural, and social aspects, North Korea has now overfulfilled the two people's economic plans, and the two-year economic plan of 1949-1950 is also being carried out victoriously. Therefore, the industrial production of some sectors in North Korea has exceeded the highest level of the Japanese imperialist era.

　　The fact that the level of industrial production has increased so rapidly shows that the foundation for the unification, independence, and democratization of our motherland is becoming increasingly solid. Thanks to the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, the lives of the people in North Korea have been rapidly improving in the five years since liberation, and national culture is also flourishing brilliantly. A life of freedom, brightness, and happiness has replaced a life of humiliation, darkness, and poverty that lasted for half a century.

　　In contrast, in South Korea, under the rule of U.S. imperialism and its stooges, the national economy has gone bankrupt. For example, if the total number of various enterprises in South Korea in 1943 was 100, it dropped to 52 percent by 1946, 37 percent by 1947, and 36 percent by 1949. For example, machine production in 1949 dropped to 5 percent compared to when Japan surrendered. In terms of agricultural economy, the cultivated land area has been reduced to 55 percent. In short, the so-called American "aid" is economic bankruptcy, and the people's lives are plunged into hunger and unemployment.

　　The Soviet Union has consistently adhered to the legitimate demands that conform to the interests of the Korean people at various international conferences concerning the Korean issue, and has resolutely struggled to promote the unification, democracy, and independence of our Korea.

　　At the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, the two Soviet-American Joint Commissions, the United Nations General Assembly, and everywhere else, the Soviet government has always striven to establish a unified democratic government for our Korea. Due to the conspiracy and obstruction of the U.S. government and the Korean reactionaries, the cause of the Soviet-American Joint Commission was shattered. At that time, the Soviet Union advocated giving the Korean people the possibility to decide the fate of their motherland with their own strength, free from foreign interference, by means of the simultaneous withdrawal of troops from Korea by the Soviet Union and the United States.

　　Based on the request made by the Korean Supreme People's Assembly in September 1948 for the simultaneous withdrawal of troops from both countries, the Soviet government immediately granted this request and completely and unconditionally withdrew its troops from Korea at the end of December 1948.

　　The Soviet Union was the first country to establish diplomatic relations with our newly born republic. Subsequently, various people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe, the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic, and many other peace-loving countries established diplomatic relations with our country. The Korean People's Army is repelling and eliminating the U.S. imperialist bandits, who are attempting to turn our Korea into their colony and military base and therefore launched a war of aggression and invaded the territory of our motherland, for the unification, independence, and thorough liberation of the motherland. The heroic combat of our People's Army, the active support of the entire people, and the existence of the world's peace-loving and powerful forces headed by the great Soviet Union are the great guarantee for our ultimate victory.

　　Now, the Soviet government is exposing the aggressive nature of the United States, which is covered up by the signboard of the United Nations, to the world, and is carrying out a resolute struggle in the Security Council.

　　In 1948, when the Soviet army withdrew, the letter of thanks from more than 16.7 million people in North and South Korea to the great leader of the Korean people and all peace-loving humanity in the world, the savior of the Korean people's liberation - Marshal Stalin, read: "The Korean people will never forget the heroic achievements of the Soviet army for thousands of generations. Many stories of this feat will be passed on to descendants like magical legends. The Korean people will forever be shrouded in infinite love and gratitude for the liberators."

　　Long live the fifth anniversary of the August 15th liberation of Korea from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism thanks to the power of the great Soviet Union!

　　Long live the great Soviet Union, the liberator of the Korean people who has given real assistance to the Korean people in the struggle for the unification, independence, and democratic development of our motherland!

　　苏联是朝鲜人民的真正的解放者与援助者
    ——纪念“八·一五”朝鲜解放五周年
    朝鲜中央通讯社驻华总分社社长  金圣容
    一九四五年八月九日苏联宣布对日处于交战状态，在苏军的英勇进击下，日本帝国主义者所吹嘘的关东军，在短期内被消灭。距宣战仅一星期，八月十五日，日本便无条件投降了。
    苏联参加对日战争前，日本还在妄想战争的有利结果，决心继续长期战争，曾经拒绝了美英中对日本的无条件投降的要求。正是因为苏联参加了对日战争以及苏联在对日作战中所起的决定性作用，在东方，日本帝国主义才被消灭，而东方各民族也得到了和平与解放。
    由于苏军的伟大胜利，一九四五年八月十五日，我祖国从半世纪之久的日本帝国主义残酷统治下，获得解放。
    维护弱小民族独立和自由的苏军，从进驻北朝鲜的第一天起，便给予朝鲜人民自主独立和民主发展的一切可能与帮助。苏军为了使朝鲜人民在政治经济文化各方面成为自己祖国的主人，特将全部政权交与朝鲜人民，给予各种民主改革的条件。
    但是，距日本军队被苏军决定性的击败而投降后一个月，登陆南朝鲜的美军从第一天起，便以南朝鲜的新统治者的姿态出现了，他们不将政权交与人民，而掌握在自己手里，剥夺了朝鲜人民的政治自由和权利，他们勾结亲日派民族叛徒，实行了殖民地化政策。这样，在五年的长时期中，美国统治者及其傀儡匪帮在南朝鲜继续了野蛮的法西斯黑暗统治。美帝国主义者破坏了将朝鲜重建为民主、统一、独立国家的唯一国际协定——莫斯科三外长会议决定与苏美共同委员会的工作，又拒绝了苏联提出的两国军队同时撤兵的最正当提案。不仅如此，美帝国主义者还在联合国中发动它的附庸国家捏造出来所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”，并把它送到南朝鲜，以恐怖、屠杀为手段，实行了与朝鲜人民意志相违背的亡国单独选举，制造出亲日派与反动匪帮的傀儡政府。这是企图把朝鲜以三八线为界的分裂固定化、在南朝鲜建立法西斯宪兵统治、永远使朝鲜作为美国在远东的侵略基地的阴谋表现。
    在苏联军队所给予的有利条件下，北朝鲜实行了土地改革和其他一系列的民主改革。由于土地改革，在封建桎梏下呻吟着的占全体人口百分之八十的农民大众得到了解放。农产品产量显著提高，农民生活随之提高，为国家工业发展创造了条件。
    苏联为帮助落后的朝鲜农村经济、普及先进的农业技术，派来了大批农业技术人员及学者，在农业改良上给以物质的援助。从一九四九年，在北朝鲜的重要农产地带设立了农业机器代耕站，开辟了农业机械化的道路。如此，解放了的北朝鲜农民成为祖国建设的伟大力量，北朝鲜从粮食缺乏的地带变成为粮食充裕的地带。
    苏联军队进驻北朝鲜以后，把日帝手里的一、○三四个工业企业所及其他设施移交朝鲜人民的手里，给予实施重要产业国有化的条件；并且以各种方法为了恢复日本帝国主义者在败亡时全部或大部予以破坏的十九个发电所以及三百个矿山及企业所，给予充分的援助。苏联专家们直接教育着不熟练的朝鲜技术人员，帮助我们恢复并改进企业所。他们在被破坏的军需工厂的基础上，指导我们建设汽车修理厂、机器厂及生产焦炭、钢铁、人造丝等的事业。
    苏联在恢复由于日本帝国主义破坏而陷入麻痹状态的运输事业上，也给与巨大的帮助。例如苏联军队修理了不能使用的五千辆车，为了确立运输体系，派了优秀的专家。苏联在为了人民经济恢复和发展与国家计划事业中在技术上、物质上都给与我们莫大的援助。特别是依据一九四九年三月所缔结的“朝苏两国关于经济文化协助的协定”，我们共和国的两年人民经济计划（一九四九年——一九五○）得到了胜利完成的保证。按照这协定，我共和国在三年之内，从苏联得到二亿两千二百万卢布的贷款，在经济文化发展和培养民族干部等各方面，受着技术上文化上的各项援助。在平等互助原则下签订的朝苏两国关于经济文化协助协定，对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的将来的兴隆与发展上，有着巨大的意义。
    朝苏两国之间的贸易额，一九四九年比一九四六年增加了百分之四百五十九·八，其中，在经济复兴与农业发展上所必要的机器和原料等的进口，占百分之六六·八。这一事实足以表示苏联对我们共和国民主发展上大公无私的帮助。
    苏联在我共和国的文化发展上，也给予巨大的帮助。许多影片、出刊物和苏联艺术已被介绍到朝鲜。文化艺术使节团屡次来往。苏联先进文化对朝鲜文化发展上起了莫大作用。苏联帮助我们在北半部建立教育体系，并派遣数百名留学生到苏联，派遣教员视察团到苏联学习苏联教育理论与方法等。这样苏联对朝鲜教育发展上也给了莫大的帮助。
    苏联为了北朝鲜保健事业的发展，曾派遣医师、学者，并供给医药品、医疗机器，派防疫队，装设医疗设备等。
    由于苏联在经济、文化社会方面巨大的帮助，今天北朝鲜已超额完成了两次人民经济计划，一九四九年——一九五○的两年经济计划也正在胜利的进行着。因此北朝鲜的若干部门工业生产已经超过了日本帝国主义时代的最高水平。
    工业生产水平，这样飞速提高的事实，说明着我们祖国统一、独立、民主化的基础日趋巩固。由于苏联兄弟般的援助，北朝鲜人民在获得解放以后的五年中生活飞跃的提高着，民族的文化也正在灿烂的开花。自由、光明和幸福的生活代替了半世纪的屈辱、黑暗和贫困的生活。
    与此相反，南朝鲜在美帝国主义及其走卒统治下，民族经济破产。如以一九四三年南朝鲜各种企业总数为一百，则到一九四六年，即降至百分之五十二，一九四七年降至百分之三十七，一九四九年已降到百分之三十六。例如：一九四九年的机器生产，比日本投降当时，降到百分之五。在农业经济方面，耕地面积减少到百分之五五。总而言之，所谓美国式的“援助”就是经济破产，人民生活陷于饥饿和失业。
    苏联在历次的有关朝鲜问题的国际会议上，坚持符合朝鲜人民利益的正当主张，为促进我们朝鲜的统一、民主和独立而坚决的斗争着。
    在莫斯科三外长会议上，两次苏美共同委员会上，联合国大会和在任何地方，苏联政府一向为我们朝鲜的统一民主政府建立而努力。由于美国政府和朝鲜反动派的阴谋阻挠，苏美共同委员会的事业遭到破裂，当时苏联主张，以苏美两军同时自朝鲜撤退的方法，给与朝鲜人民不受外国的干涉，用自己的力量来决定祖国命运的可能性。
    依据一九四八年九月朝鲜最高人民会议提出两国军队同时撤退的要求，苏联政府立即允诺这要求，并于一九四八年十二月底，从朝鲜无条件的完全撤军。
    苏联是第一个与我们新生共和国建立外交关系的国家。继之，东欧各人民民主国家与中华人民共和国、德意志民主共和国等很多爱好和平的国家和我国建立了外交关系。朝鲜人民军为祖国统一独立与彻底解放正在击退并消灭着企图把我们朝鲜变成自己的殖民地与军事基地因而发动侵略战争侵入祖国疆土的美帝国主义强盗，我人民军的英勇作战、全体人民的积极支援与伟大的苏联为首的世界爱好和平强大力量的存在，就是我们获得最后胜利的伟大保障。
    现在苏联政府向全世界揭露美国利用联合国招牌所掩盖的侵略本质，在安全理事会进行着坚决的斗争。
    一九四八年苏军撤退时，由南北朝鲜一千六百七十多万人民签名给朝鲜人民与全世界爱好和平人类的伟大领袖、朝鲜人民解放的救星——斯大林大元帅的感谢文上写着：“朝鲜人民千秋万代不会忘记苏维埃军队英勇的伟勋。对这伟勋的很多故事将神奇传说般地传给子子孙孙。朝鲜人民将永远笼罩着对解放者的无限敬爱与感谢。”
    由于伟大苏联的武力从日本帝国主义殖民地统治下解放朝鲜的八·一五五周年纪念万岁！
    在我们祖国的统一独立与民主发展的斗争中，给朝鲜人民以真正援助的朝鲜人民的解放者伟大的苏联万岁！
