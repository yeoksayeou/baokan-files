　　Labor Hero Zhao Guoyou Declares:
    Answer American Aggression with Iron Fists; Not Allowing It to Run Wild Before Us
    [Reported by this newspaper] Labor Hero Zhao Guoyou telegraphed this newspaper from Shenyang, expressing his opinions on the American aircraft's invasion of our country's airspace. The telegram reads as follows:
    The provocative and brutal acts of the American Air Force in invading China's territorial airspace are a serious crime that violates the will of the people of the world and attempts to expand the war and destroy peace; it is something that the people of the world can never tolerate. We, the working class, first of all, support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and demands to Acheson and the Security Council, and resolutely demand that the US government compensate for the losses. Otherwise, our working class will never tolerate it. We will answer the atrocities of American imperialism with unparalleled iron fists! Our working class's iron fists, our incomparably powerful People's Liberation Army, and the 475 million hardworking and brave people of the new China under the leadership of our working class, have eliminated Japanese fascism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the running dogs of American imperialism. These facts should be a powerful lesson for American imperialist aggression. We workers must heighten our vigilance, break with blind peace viewpoints, prepare our strength, and make all crazy aggressors retrace the path to the demise of Japanese fascism. After hearing the news of the American aircraft's invasion of our airspace, we workers, in addition to further recognizing the hideous face of American imperialism, have also greatly increased our production enthusiasm. We will definitely use the practical actions of running model workshops to oppose American imperialism and will never allow it to run wild before us!

　　劳动英雄赵国有表示：
    拿铁拳回答美国的侵略
    不许它在我们面前发狂
    【本报讯】劳动英雄赵国有自沈阳致电本报，为美机侵犯我国领空事发表意见。电文如下：
    美国空军侵入中国领土上空的挑衅和残暴行为，是违背全世界人民意志，并企图扩大战争破坏和平的严重罪行；是全世界人民所决不能容忍的。我们工人阶级，首先拥护周外长向艾奇逊和安理会提出的抗议与要求，坚决让美国政府赔偿损失。否则，我们工人阶级是决不能容忍的。我们将以无比的铁拳来回答美帝国主义的暴行！我们工人阶级的钢铁拳头，我们强大无比的解放军，我们工人阶级领导的四万七千五百万勤劳勇敢的新中国人民，曾经消灭日本法西斯和美帝走狗蒋介石匪帮，这些事实，应该是美帝侵略的有力教训。我们工人一定提高警惕，打破盲目和平观点，准备力量，叫一切疯狂的侵略者重走日本法西斯灭亡的道路。我们工人听了美机侵犯我领空的消息后，除了进一步认清美帝的狰狞面孔外，并激增了我们的生产热情。我们一定用搞好模范车间的实际行动，来反对美帝，决不允许它在我们面前发狂！
