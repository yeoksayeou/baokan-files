	[Our Newspaper] According to Guangming Daily on the 22nd: The democratic parties and democratic figures in South China, in response to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for a rectification movement, held a mobilization meeting for rectification in Guangzhou on August 13th. More than 400 representatives from the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, non-party democratic figures, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, and democratic figures from industrial and commercial circles attended; Rao Zhangfeng, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the South China Branch of the CPC Central Committee, and Li Fanfu, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department, were also invited to participate.
	Li Zhangda pointed out in his opening remarks that the purpose of the meeting was to emulate the spirit of the Chinese Communist Party in adhering to progress and correcting mistakes, so that the democratic parties could also launch such a rectification movement. He emphasized the need to resolutely fight under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to correct mistakes, correct thinking, improve organization, and expand and consolidate the people's democratic united front. Representatives at the meeting spoke one after another, unanimously expressing their willingness to actively participate in the rectification movement. The meeting decided that the rectification of the democratic parties and democratic figures in Guangzhou would be carried out in groups from August 13th to October 30th.
	The Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League recently issued a notice to all branches, sub-branches, and directly affiliated groups in the region, calling on all members to participate in the rectification study. The notice stipulates that cadres at all levels who are members of the League should actively participate in the rectification study under the leadership of the study committees of their respective organizations; during the study process, they should adopt a kind and responsible attitude towards the people, and appropriately raise opinions and questions; and in examining their own thinking and work style, they should earnestly transform themselves and improve themselves. Members without positions should conduct study under the leadership of their respective groups, following certain steps. The notice stipulates that each branch and sub-branch should immediately make arrangements for rectification study after receiving the instructions, and constantly supervise and check the study process.
	According to Guangming Daily news on the 19th and 22nd: The Southern General Branch of the China Democratic League and the Guangdong Provincial Branch held a cadre meeting from the 4th to the 7th of this month. The central topic of the meeting was: "Summarize experience, rectify thinking, improve organization, strengthen unity, expand and consolidate the people's democratic united front, and fight under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to strive for a basic improvement in the national financial and economic situation, realize land reform, oppose American imperialist aggression, and defend world peace!" Around this central topic, representatives from various places extensively exchanged work experience and criticized the non-united front thinking of some comrades' liquidationism and departmentalism. They also grasped the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and carried out a struggle to uphold truth and correct mistakes against individual cadre comrades. Under the chairmanship of Li Zhangda, Director of the Southern General Branch, the meeting successively heard and approved the political report of Zhang Wen, Director of the Provisional Working Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Branch, the report of Li Boqiu, a member of the Southern General Branch, "Fighting under the Leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to Strive for a Basic Improvement in the National Financial and Economic Situation and Realize National Land Reform," and the summary report on League affairs of Guo Qiaoran, Deputy Director of the Provisional Working Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Branch.
