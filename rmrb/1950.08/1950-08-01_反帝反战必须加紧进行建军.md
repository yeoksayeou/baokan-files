　　Anti-Imperialism and Anti-War Must Accelerate Military Building
    Peng Zemin
    Recalling that on this day twenty-three years ago, when we participated in the Nanchang Uprising to punish Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang who betrayed the revolution, the participating troops only numbered over 30,000. However, after a long period of arduous struggle, this force not only developed into the People's Liberation Army of today with more than five million troops, but also basically completed the war task of liberating Chinese territory (except Taiwan and Tibet) and overthrowing the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This revolutionary history proves that in colonial countries and oppressed nations, if they want to achieve liberation and independence, they must rely on the people's armed forces to carry out tenacious military struggles to achieve victory. And this people's armed force must be led by the Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism to smoothly and correctly implement and complete the revolutionary task. The failures of previous revolutions in China have clearly taught us this experience. The saying that there would be no New China without the Communist Party is the most correct historical conclusion.
    "The process of struggle is the process of power development." Revolutionary forces that have grown strong through hard struggles of blood and sweat are bound to be invincible. Chinese history has proven this, and the Vietnamese revolution and the current Korean people's liberation war also prove this. Based on this experience, no matter how much U.S. imperialism clamors for continued mobilization and reinforcements after suffering defeat after defeat in South Korea, the heroic Korean people will surely be able to eliminate it and achieve complete victory. No matter how much U.S. imperialism sends troops to aid Chiang Kai-shek and invade Taiwan, the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army have the greatest determination and the power of sure victory to eliminate it and liberate it.
    It must be seen that, on the one hand, due to the success of the Chinese people's revolution, the victory of the Korean people's liberation war, and the daily expansion of international peace forces, on the other hand, the imperialist camp headed by the United States is also actively deploying and carrying out wars of aggression. As long as imperialism exists, the threat of war cannot be eliminated for a single day, and the more imperialism suffers defeats, the more frantic it will become. Today, although most of China's territory has been liberated, generally speaking, China's war tasks have not yet been eliminated, and in the future, with the end of the internal war, there will be serious national defense tasks. Therefore, in order to quickly liberate Taiwan, to consolidate national defense, to support Korea, and to defend world peace, our current task, in addition to developing production and construction, is to accelerate military building and establish a national defense force including the navy, army, and air force. We must have sufficient armed forces for peace in order to prevent and overcome the imperialist plots and actions of aggressive war.

　　反帝反战必须加紧进行建军
    彭泽民
    回忆在二十三年前的今日，当我们参加南昌起义讨伐背叛革命的蒋介石国民党时，参加起义的部队只有三万多人。但这支部队经过了长期间的坚苦奋斗，不单使本身发展成了今日拥有五百多万部队的人民解放军，而且胜利的基本完成了解放中国领土（除台湾、西藏外）和推翻了帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义的反动统治的战争任务。从这一革命历史证明了：在殖民地国家和被压迫的民族想要求得解放独立，必须依靠人民的武装进行顽强的军事斗争才能获得胜利。而这种人民的武装力量又必须在马列主义武装下的共产党来领导，才能顺利的正确的执行并完成革命的任务。中国过去历次革命的失败，使我们很明显的得出了这条经验。所谓没有共产党就没有新中国，是最正确的历史结论。
    “斗争的过程就是力量发展的过程”，一切从流血流汗的坚强斗争发展壮大起来的革命力量，必然是最勇无敌的。中国的历史证明了这条，越南的革命和今日的朝鲜人民的解放战争也同样证明了这条。根据这条的经验，不管今天美帝国主义在南朝鲜遭受到一败再败之后如何叫嚣要继续动员增援，但是英勇的朝鲜人民一定能够消灭它而获得全部胜利的。也不管美帝国主义如何派兵援助蒋介石、侵略台湾，但是中国人民和人民解放军是有着最大决心和必胜的力量来消灭它解放它的。
    必须看到，一方面是由于中国人民革命的成功，朝鲜人民解放战争的胜利，以及国际和平力量的天天膨大，另一方面，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营也在积极布置并进行侵略战争的。帝国主义存在一天战争的威胁就一日不能解除，而且当帝国主义越是遭受到失败的时候会越发疯狂起来的。今天，中国的领土虽然绝大部分已经解放了，但从总的方面说来，中国的战争任务还是没有解除的，而且今后随着对内战争结束，还有严重的国防任务。因此，为了迅速解放台湾，为了巩固国防，为了声援朝鲜，为了保卫世界和平，我们的当前的任务除了发展生产建设外，必须加紧进行建军，建立一支包括海陆空的国防军。我们必须要有足够的和平武装力量，才可能制阻并克服帝国主义的侵略战争阴谋和行动。
