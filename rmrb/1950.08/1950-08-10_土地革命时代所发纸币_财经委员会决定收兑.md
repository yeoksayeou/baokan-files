Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council has decided to redeem the paper money issued by the democratic governments during the Land Revolution War era. This decision was communicated by the Central Financial and Economic Committee to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central-South Military and Political Committee on July 13th for implementation. The redemption price, as stipulated by the Central Financial and Economic Committee, is to be calculated at a rate of twelve yuan of the old currency to one silver yuan, converted to Renminbi. The Central-South Region has now begun this redemption work.

The paper money issued during the Land Revolution War era had a wide circulation and high credit value in the red areas of provinces such as Jiangxi and Fujian. After the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army withdrew from these areas, the Kuomintang reactionary government strictly prohibited its circulation and forbade the people from keeping it. In Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, peasants were even executed for being found in possession of this currency. However, many local people, regardless of the enemy's prohibition and persecution, preserved these banknotes in various ways. It is estimated that in Jiangxi Province alone, the paper money from the Land Revolution War era still circulating among the people amounts to over one hundred thousand yuan.

　　土地革命时代所发纸币
    财经委员会决定收兑
    【新华社九日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会已决定收兑土地革命战争时代民主政府所发行的纸币。这一决定已由中央财委会于七月十三日通知中南军政委员会财委会执行。收兑价格经中央财委会规定按当时钞票十二元比银元一元折合人民币计算。现中南区已开始进行此项收兑工作。
    按土地革命战争时代发行的纸币，在江西、福建等省红色区域内流通范围甚广，币值信用很高。中国工农红军撤离这些区域后，国民党反动政府严禁流通，不许人民保存，在江西省玉山县即曾因搜获这些钞票枪毙过农民。但当地不少人民仍不顾敌人的禁止和迫害，用各种方式把这些钞票保存下来。据估计仅江西一省现在散存于民间的土地革命战争时代的纸币约有一百数十万元。
