Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Our correspondent on the Korean front reports: The reporter recently visited Incheon, Suwon, Pyeongtaek, Jochiwon, Daejeon and other places. In the newly liberated cities and villages, driving at night, you can see that the full strength of every corner is in motion under the moonlight. Teams of Korean people are transporting ammunition and food to the army. Everyone is contributing all their strength to the unification and independence of the motherland. Thousands upon thousands of newly enlisted young men and women volunteer soldiers, wearing neat military uniforms and carrying backpacks, are marching heroically to their garrison. They demonstrate the lofty patriotic spirit of the people of all strata in South Korea. In Incheon alone, as of the morning of the day we visited (July 26), more than 7,000 workers and students had joined the volunteer army, including more than 1,000 women. In addition, there were more than 4,000 young men and women who signed up to volunteer, but were persuaded by the People's Committee to stay due to work needs or unmet conditions.

In Jochiwon and Daejeon, we saw young workers from the railway repair team. Their work achievements are amazing. Wherever the People's Army fights, they repair. Wherever enemy planes destroy, they repair it on the same day. Sometimes they insist on working for more than 24 hours continuously. Their selfless labor enabled Daejeon to be connected to Pyongyang by train within ten days of its liberation. A young technician named Li Xihuan angrily told the reporter: "The American devils cannot win against the heroic People's Army at the front, so they come to the rear to wantonly bomb peaceful residents." As he spoke, he held up his little thumb.

In a place called Yongjeon Village, five or six kilometers south of Daejeon, the reporter and a nineteen-year-old member of the Democratic Patriotic Youth League's security team used stones to communicate on a small field next to a rice paddy. He understood most common Chinese characters. He was not only familiar with the history of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also knew about current international affairs. When we finished writing, he took my hand and wrote three names on the ground with stones - Kim Il-sung, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and finally added two words - Long live.

### 南朝鲜人民站立起来了  动员一切力量支援解放战争

　　南朝鲜人民站立起来了
    动员一切力量支援解放战争
    【新华社十六日讯】本社朝鲜战地记者报道：记者最近访问了仁川、水原、平泽、鸟致院、大田等地。在新解放的城市和农村中，夜间行车，在月光之下你可以看到任何一个角落的全部力量都在动。成队的朝鲜人民，在给军队运输军火粮食。每个人都为祖国的统一、独立贡献着自己的一切力量。成千成万的新入伍的男女青年义勇军，穿着整齐的军装，背着行囊，雄赳赳地开赴驻地。他们表现着南朝鲜各阶层人民崇高的爱国主义精神。只仁川一地，截至我们往访的那一天（七月二十六日）上午，已有七千余工人、学生参加了义勇军，其中包括妇女一千余人。另外还有报名请缨的四千余男女青年，因工作需要或条件不合而被人民委员会劝阻。
    在鸟致院和大田，我们看到了铁道修复队的青年工人。他们的工作成绩是惊人的。人民军打到那里，他们修到那里。敌机在那里破坏，他们当天就在那里修。有时连续坚持工作达二十四小时以上。他们的忘我劳动，使大田在解放后十天就与平壤通了车。一位名叫李锡焕的青年技工气愤地对记者说：“美国鬼子在前方打不赢英勇的人民军，到后方来滥炸和平居民。”他一边说一边伸出小姆指来。
    在大田以南五、六公里的一个名叫龙田村的地方，记者和一位十九岁的民主爱国青年同盟治安队队员，用石块在稻田旁边的小坪上笔谈起来。一般的汉字他都能了解。他不但熟悉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的历史，而且知道当前的国际时事。当我们结束笔谈的时候，他拉着我的手，用石块在地上写了三个名字——金日成、斯大林、毛泽东，最后加上两个字——万岁。
