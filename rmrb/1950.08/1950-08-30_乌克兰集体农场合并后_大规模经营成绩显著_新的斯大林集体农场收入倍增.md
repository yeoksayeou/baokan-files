　　Xinhua News Agency, Kiev, August 24th: According to TASS, several small collective farms in the Ukrainian Republic of the Soviet Union have achieved significant results after merging into large-scale operations. Currently, approximately four thousand large-scale collective farms have been established, harvesting grain abundantly and undertaking large-scale construction projects.

　　The largest collective farm in Ukraine, the New Stalin Collective Farm in the Kiev region, was formed by merging six small farms. This year, the farm's total income will exceed ten million rubles, approximately twice the total income of the small farms before the merger. More than four thousand collective farmers are cultivating over two thousand hectares of arable land along the Dnieper River on this farm. As a result of the large-scale use of agricultural machinery, an average of two and a half tons of grain can be harvested per hectare of land. The new farm system has been adjusted according to Michurin's scientific methods. In addition to the original eight hundred hectares of forest and protective forest belts, four hundred hectares of woodland are being planted this year, and huge orchards will be established.

　　The "March 8th" Collective Farm in the Kharkov region is also an excellent example. This collective farm, headed by Yaroshenko, a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and a hero of socialist labor, owns four thousand hectares of land, with huge livestock farms containing nine hundred heads of beef and dairy cattle, six hundred and seventy pigs, and nine hundred and fifty sheep. The collective farm is one of the first collective farms in the Kharkov region to complete its grain delivery plan. It is now planting winter crops and using a large sum of the farm's income to begin building a new town for the collective farm with a cultural center, a summer theater, a school, a department store, a medical station, and several service institutions.

　　乌克兰集体农场合并后
    大规模经营成绩显著
    新的斯大林集体农场收入倍增
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社基辅二十四日讯：苏联乌克兰共和国的若干小型集体农场，于合并进行大规模经营后，已获显著成绩。现在约有四千个大规模的集体农场已经建立起来，正在丰收谷物并进行着大规模的建设工程。
    乌克兰最大的一个集体农场——基辅州的新的斯大林集体农场，是由六个小农场合并起来的。今年该农场的总收入将超过一千万卢布，约等于合并前各小农场总收入的两倍。在这个农场的绵亘在德聂伯河畔的二千多公顷的耕地上，有四千多集体农民在耕作着。大规模使用农业机械的结果，使每公顷的土地上平均可以收获两吨半的谷物。新农场制度都已按照米丘林的科学方法加以调整。除原有的八百多公顷的森林和防护林以外，今年正在种植四百公顷的树林，并将开辟巨大的果树园。
    哈尔科夫州的“三八”集体农场也是一个优良的范例。这个以苏联最高苏维埃代表、社会主义劳动英雄雅洛森科为首的集体农场，拥有四千公顷土地，巨大的牲畜饲养场里有九百头食用牛和乳牛，六百七十只猪和九百五十只羊。该集体农场是哈尔科夫州首批完成缴纳公粮计划的集体农场之一。现在正进行种植冬季作物，并以农场收入的巨款来开始建筑一个有文化馆、夏令剧院、学校、百货商店、医药站以及若干服务机构的集体农场的新市镇。
