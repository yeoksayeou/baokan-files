　　Why Take Care of Small Land Lessors?
　　To the Editor:
    Article 5 of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates the care of small land lessors. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi said in the "Report on the Question of Land Reform": "This has some unfavorable effects on rural production, but not major ones"; and taking care of small land lessors "is necessary." We are not quite clear about why we should take care of small land lessors. Please explain.

Lu Xian Comrade:
    The so-called small land lessors refer to revolutionary soldiers, families of martyrs, workers, staff, freelancers, peddlers, and those who lease out small amounts of land due to engaging in other occupations or lacking labor. It is necessary to provide special care for them in accordance with Article 5 of the Land Reform Law. Because taking care of the small amount of land leased out by revolutionary soldiers and the direct relatives of martyrs who died in previous revolutions since the Xinhai Revolution, as well as the direct relatives of martyrs who died in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, is a necessary consideration for those who have contributed to the people's revolutionary cause; this is supported by the broad masses of the people. Secondly, small land lessors such as workers, staff, freelancers, and peddlers are mostly manual or mental laborers themselves, and are essentially different from the landlord class, so they should not be regarded as landlords. Taking care of the small amount of land leased out by these people is not only conducive to the unity of workers and peasants, but also to the unity of all working people in urban and rural areas. Again, those widows, widowers, orphans, and disabled people who lack labor power rely on renting out small amounts of land for a living, which they do out of helplessness; it is also necessary to take care of them. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi has already given a very clear explanation on this point: "Because there is no social insurance for the unemployed and those who have lost their labor power in China, and many of these lands are purchased with the labor of each individual, it is somewhat beneficial to retain this part of the land and let them continue to rent it out or cultivate it themselves."

### 为什么要照顾小土地出租者？

　　为什么要照顾小土地出租者？编辑同志：
    中华人民共和国土地改革法第五条规定了照顾小土地出租者。刘少奇副主席在《关于土地改革问题的报告》中说：“这对于农村生产是有一些不利影响的，但没有大的不利”；而照顾小土地出租者“乃是必要的”。我们对于为什么要照顾小土地出租者还不太明白。请你们解释一下。
        陆鲜陆鲜同志：
    所谓小土地出租者，是指革命军人、烈士家属、工人、职员、自由职业者、小贩以及因从事其他职业或因缺乏劳动力而出租小量土地者。对于他们，依据土地改革法第五条规定加以特殊照顾，是必要的。因为照顾革命军人及自辛亥革命以来历次为革命阵亡和死难烈士的直系亲属及抗日阵亡将士和人民解放战争中阵亡将士的直系亲属等出租的小量土地，是对有功于人民革命事业者的一种必要的照顾；这是广大人民所拥护的。其次，工人、职员、自由职业者、小贩等小土地出租者本人大都是体力劳动者或脑力劳动者，与地主阶级有本质上的区别，自不应把他们当做地主看待。照顾这些人所出租的小量土地，不仅有利于工农团结，也有利于城乡全体劳动人民之间的团结。再次，那些缺乏劳动力的鳏、寡、孤、独以及残废人等，他们依靠出租小量土地为生，则是处于无可奈何的情况下才这样做的；对于他们加以照顾，亦属必要。对于这一点，刘少奇副主席已经有很明白的解释：“因为在中国对于失业及丧失劳动力的人员还没有社会保险，而这些土地很多又是各人劳动所得购置者，故保留这一部分土地，并由其继续出租或自耕，是有一些好处的。
