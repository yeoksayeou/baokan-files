　　Qingdao Municipality Measures for Correcting Tax Evasion
    Self-Examination and Declaration of Omitted Taxes for Supplementary Payment
    Fan Xingke
    Since Qingdao's liberation a year ago, the serious phenomenon of tax evasion in tax work has become one of the main problems in Qingdao's tax work. In order to strictly implement tax policies, eliminate tax evasion, implement reasonable burdens, and encourage and educate industrialists and businessmen to recognize that consciously paying taxes is an obligation; at the same time, according to the current inspection work in Qingdao, we must change the purely administrative order and emphasis on the legal system in tax work, and develop the correct style of the mass line in tax work. Therefore, the Municipal Taxation Bureau announced the "Self-Examination and Declaration of Omitted Taxes for Supplementary Payment" method in mid-June, originally scheduled to be completed from June 15th to 30th, but later extended to July 10th due to changing circumstances.

    First, Three Important Tasks Must Be Done Well

    In order to ensure the vigorous development of this work and achieve the expected results, the following three important tasks were decided:

    1. The Municipal Taxation Bureau and each tax office established tax research classes, convening accountants from various industrial and commercial households in batches to participate, explaining various tax laws (mainly stamp tax, temporary business tax, and goods tax), and publicizing the significance of self-examination and supplementary tax payment. Each session lasts three or four days, two hours per day.

    2. Tax inspectors established a dedicated responsibility system, dividing the work according to streets to promote this movement. Through the publicity and mobilization of self-examination and supplementary tax payment, combined with tax research classes, we will conduct mass self-examination of smuggling and tax evasion in a guided manner, and correct the serious and bad tax evasion practices existing among industrialists and businessmen.

    3. Tax authorities actively contacted relevant departments (mainly the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Shop Employees' Union) to strive for strong cooperation.

    Certain Achievements Have Been Made

    According to the above decisions, the Municipal Taxation Bureau first convened a joint meeting of chairmen of industry associations throughout the city through the Federation of Industry and Commerce to mobilize, and then dispatched a team of inspectors to each tax office to help establish tax research classes. Around June 20th, each tax office established a class affairs committee (with five to nine members each) to specifically lead the learning of the tax research class. Due to the planned implementation of a series of organizational preparation work, although some shortcomings and deviations occurred from the beginning to the end of this work, it was generally smooth and achieved the following results:

    1. The four tax offices held a total of twelve tax research classes, with participants from seventy-seven industries and one thousand two hundred and forty-four industrial and commercial households, one accountant per household. The participants from each industry were mainly large and medium-sized industrial and commercial households, and also some small industrial and commercial households.

    From June 15th to July 10th, a total of four thousand five hundred and sixty-six households paid supplementary taxes, with a total of 753,433,000+ yuan in supplementary goods tax, stamp tax, and temporary business tax. Calculated at 750 yuan per jin of millet, this is equivalent to over 1 million jin of millet.

    The tax recovered along with the fines from inspection in the first half of the year in Qingdao was only equivalent to 400,000+ jin of millet. This tells us that the working method of the mass line in preventing tax evasion and inspection work is far superior to the working method of simply using the old legal concept to check taxes.

    2. Industrialists and businessmen have improved their understanding of the people's government's tax laws. Shunxingyong and Deji Coal Shops in Banqiaofang, Sancang District, initially did not have a sufficient understanding of self-examination and felt that "there was nothing to check." After education, they turned to actively self-examine and promoted other industries. He said: "Self-examination and supplementary tax payment is the people's government helping us solve past mistakes (referring to tax evasion) and making our future operations regular. We must not only thoroughly check ourselves, but also ensure that we promote other businesses to check." In addition to self-examining 4,100,000+ yuan of invoices that had not been stamped, he also promoted Hengshengtai to check 30,000,000+ yuan, Yuanxingmao 30,000,000+ yuan, Wanghe Pot Factory 65,960,000+ yuan, and Liyuan Pot Factory 4,340,000+ yuan of invoices that had not been stamped. Under the promotion of this company, a total of 250,270,000+ yuan of unstamped invoices were paid. The Yidehe team in Bohai Village, Dongzhen District, consisting of three groups with a total of twenty-nine households, took the initiative to convene business meetings and conducted self-examination and mutual examination. The Xinhua Weaving Factory team, consisting of ten households, all made detailed self-examinations and paid 3,470,000+ yuan in supplementary taxes. Generally, industrial and commercial households recognized the benefits of self-examination and supplementary tax payment. For example, the leader of the Qingdao Dyeing and Weaving Factory team said: "The people's government is truly concerned and responsible for the development of industry and commerce, and patiently explains our past illegal activities one by one. I understand this time! I will definitely not commit them again in the future. Today's government is fundamentally different from the reactionary Kuomintang government in the past. In the past, when they (referring to the reactionary Kuomintang government) came to check accounts, they first told the address of the accountant—that's called giving gifts!"

    The above facts clearly illustrate that this mass movement has politically enabled industrialists and businessmen to further and more deeply appreciate that the tax policy of the people's government is fundamentally different from that of the reactionary Kuomintang government.

    3. Improved and strengthened the relationship between the government and the masses. After self-examination and supplementary tax payment, the relationship between taxpayers and tax workers has improved significantly compared to before. In the past, the general industrial and commercial households were affected by the reactionary Kuomintang government and felt that tax workers were scary and dared not approach them. Now, they generally feel that tax workers have a kind attitude and patiently answer questions, reversing the old emotions of businessmen in the past and breaking down barriers. For example, the Chang'an Dyeing and Weaving Factory said when talking about their feelings about the tax research class: "In the past, I was afraid of seeing tax workers and dared not approach them. Now, not only dare I approach them, but I can also study and discuss problems with them and answer our questions. Today's tax workers are really different from those of the reactionary Kuomintang government." At the same time, the number of merchants who actively inquire about problems from the tax authorities and report tax evaders by letter has increased compared to before. Tax inspectors also feel that they have reliance and methods.

    Shortcomings in the Work

    Due to the lack of experience in leading this movement, some shortcomings and deviations occurred in the work:

    1. The organizational preparation work was not specific and thorough enough. The Municipal Taxation Bureau did not establish a specialized organization to lead this work, so the answers to questions were not timely and consistent, especially after the Central Finance and Economics Commission announced the early implementation of the new tax law on "July 1st".

    2. There was a disconnection between the tax research class and the inspection work. Some units only paid attention to publicity and education work, while abandoning or neglecting regular inspection work. Some units did not have a sufficient understanding of the spirit that the implementation of self-examination and supplementary tax payment should focus on publicity and education, so the publicity work was not well developed, the publicity surface was not wide, and the work was passive.

    3. When lecturing in the tax research class, there were too few connections with specific problems, and too much emphasis was placed on the interpretation of clauses, which made the audience feel bored and difficult to accept.

    4. Insufficient efforts were made to actively contact relevant departments and use various organizational forces to vigorously promote this movement. Although the cooperation of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Shop Employees' Union was obtained, the close contact and specific arrangements between the tax offices and the industry associations and shop employee sub-associations were not thoroughly implemented, so the organizational role was not fully utilized to vigorously carry out this work.

    A Few Preliminary Experiences

    In the twenty-five days of work, we have had the following preliminary experiences:

    1. This self-examination and declaration of omitted taxes for supplementary payment work not only educated the masses, but also educated and improved tax workers. Because this work is based on the mass line and the method of mutual research, not only did tax workers publicize, educate, and explain tax policies and regulations to the masses, but the masses also raised many questions to the tax workers, thus forcing tax workers to seize the time to learn in order to solve these problems. In this way, the education of tax workers has played a certain promoting role. This is not only a successful work experience, but also an important method for tax workers to face the masses, learn from the masses, and strengthen the mass concept.

    2. At the beginning of this work, there must be sufficient preparation, more meetings, more research, and discussions. Because this is new work and lacks experience, the situation must be reported once every night. The time should not be too long to solve the problems that occur in the work. This is absolutely necessary at the initial stage; otherwise, the specific leaders will feel at a loss as to what to do. As the work progresses and experience increases, the meetings can be appropriately reduced.

    3. Learning and self-examination of supplementary tax payment work must be well combined. In the early stage, some industrial and commercial households believed that they must complete all the learning before self-examining, so there were very few applicants for supplementary payment during the learning process, and learning could not be linked with actual work. After correction, the number of supplementary tax payers immediately increased. At the same time, more practical problems were raised in the learning process, overcoming the disconnection between learning and self-examination of supplementary tax payment work.

    4. Patiently explain the policies and regulations, and promptly break down their ideological concerns. Some industrial and commercial households do not have a sufficient understanding of the self-examination and declaration of omitted taxes for supplementary payment, cannot directly raise their own questions, and have fears of being punished. Some are afraid of exposing their true situation and becoming the object of anti-smuggling, so they ask relatives and friends to pay supplementary taxes on their behalf. These concerns must be thoroughly explained during the learning process the meaning of self-examination and supplementary tax payment, prevent circling around small issues, and avoid the formalism style of being overhasty. When explaining various policies and tax laws, there must be a systematic connection with specific tax items (such as when talking about stamp tax, the various documents and vouchers for opening a business, signing contracts, establishing accounts, and buying and selling goods, explaining which ones should be stamped). During the discussion, it is necessary to explain in detail the New Democracy's five economic policies of overall planning, taking into account all aspects, division of labor and cooperation, and each getting what they deserve. It is very clear to connect with reality for education and break down their ideological concerns.

    Editor's Note: The "self-examination of tax evasion and declaration of supplementary payment" method adopted by the Qingdao Municipal Taxation Bureau is worth referring to by tax bureaus in various places. The advantage of this method is: implementing the mass line and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, thus increasing national fiscal revenue. This is much better than using simple administrative orders and emphasizing the legal system. However, when adopting this method, all localities must, like Qingdao, first do three important tasks well. Otherwise, the "self-examination and supplementary payment" will fall into self-reliance and fail to achieve the expected results.

　　青岛市纠正偷漏税办法
    自查漏税申报补缴
    范行克
    青市解放一年来在税收工作中偷税漏税的严重现象，成为青市税收工作中主要问题之一。为了严格贯彻税收政策，消灭偷漏，实行合理负担，鼓励教育工商业者认识自觉纳税是应尽的义务；同时根据青市当前检查工作的情况，转变税收工作中单纯行政命令强调法制的观点，开展税收工作中的群众路线的正确作风。因此，市税务局曾于六月中旬公布了“自查漏税申报补缴”办法，原规定自六月十五日至三十日进行完毕，后因情况变化，延至七月十日结束。
    先要作好三项重要工作
    为保证这一工作有力的开展，并收到预期的效果，决定了以下三项重要的工作：
    一、市税局各税务所成立税务研究班，分期召集各工商业户的会计人员参加，讲解各种税法（主要是印花税、临商税、货物税），宣传自查补税的意义。每期三、四天，每天二小时。
    二、税务检查员建立了专责制，按街道分工推动这一运动。通过自查补税的宣传动员，结合税务研究班，有领导的进行群众自己检查走私漏税，纠正工商业者存在着的严重的恶劣的偷漏作风。
    三、税务机关主动的联系各有关部门（主要的是工商联合会、店员工会）争取有力的配合。
    做出了一定的成绩
    根据上述决定，市税务局首先通过工商联召开全市各行业公会主任委员联席会进行动员，又派出一部检查员到各税务所帮助成立税务研究班。六月二十日前后各税务所均成立了班务委员会（委员五至九人不等）具体领导税务研究班的学习。由于有计划的进行了一系列的组织准备工作，使这一工作从开始到结束，虽然也曾发生了一些缺点及偏差，但一般的说是顺利的，而且获得了以下的成绩：
    一、四个税务所共举办十二期税务研究班，参加行业七十七个，一千二百四十四个工商业户的会计参加学习，每户会计一人，每行业参加者主要是大中工商业户，也有一部小工商业户。
    从六月十五日至七月十日二十五天当中共计补税四千五百六十六户，补缴货物税、印花税、临商税共计七亿五千三百四十三万三千余元，按小米每斤七五○元计，折小米一百万余斤。
    而青市上半年检查补税连罚金在内，也不过折小米四十余万斤，这就告诉了我们防止偷漏，检查工作的群众路线的工作方法，远比单纯的以旧的法制观点的工作方法来查税优越。
    二、工商业者对人民政府税法的认识有了提高。四沧区板桥坊顺兴永、德记煤号最初对自查认识不够，感到“没有什么可查”，经教育后，转为积极自查，并推动其他行业。他说：“自查补税，是人民政府帮助我们解决过去的错误（指漏税），使今后的经营走上正规，我们不但要自己彻底查，还要保证推动别的商号查。”除了他自查出四千一百余万元的发货票未贴印花外，还推动恒盛泰查出三千余万元，源兴茂三千余万元，王合锅厂六千五百九十六万余元，立元锅厂四百三十四万余元的发货票均未贴印花。在该号的推动下，共计补缴未贴印花发货票额二亿五千零二十七万元。东镇区波海村义德合大组下设三个小组共二十九户，主动召开业户会议，普遍进行了自查与互查。新华织布厂组十余户均作到详尽的自查，补税三百四十七万余元。一般工商业户都认识到自查补税的好处，如青岛染织厂组长说：“人民政府对发展工商业真关心负责，把我们过去违法之事，都一一耐心的解释，这次明白啦！今后一定不再犯了，今天的政府与过去国民党反动政府是根本不同，过去他们（指国民党反动政府）来查账，先告诉查账人的地址——叫送礼啊！”
    以上的事实很清楚的说明了这一群众性的运动，在政治上使工商业者更深刻的进一步体会到人民政府的税收政策与国民党反动政府根本不同的。
    三、改善与密切了政府与群众的关系。经过自查补税，纳税人与税务工作人员的关系较前有了显著改善，过去一般工商业户，因受国民党反动政府的影响，感到税务工作人员可怕，不敢接近。现在普遍感到税务工作人员态度和蔼，解答问题耐心，扭转了商人过去的旧的情绪，打破了隔阂。如长安染织厂谈到对税务研究班的感觉时说：“过去见到税务工作人员害怕，不敢接近，现在，不但敢接近，并且能在一起研究讨论问题，给我们解答问题。今天的税务工作人员与国民党反动政府时真有天地之别。”同时，商人主动到税收机关询问问题及来信告发逃税者均较前增多。税务检查人员也感到有了依靠，有了办法。
    工作中发生的缺点
    由于领导上对这一运动缺乏经验，因而在工作中发生了一些缺点与偏差：
    一、在组织准备工作上尚欠具体周密。市税局未成立领导这一工作的专门组织，因而对问题的解答不够及时与一致，特别是“七一”中央财经委员会公布提前施行新税法以后。
    二、税务研究班与检查工作存在着脱节现象。有的单位只注意了宣传教育工作，而放弃或忽视了经常性的检查工作。有的单位对贯彻自查补税工作应以宣传教育为主的精神认识不够，因而宣教工作未很好的开展起来，宣传面不广，工作被动。
    三、税务研究班讲课时，联系具体问题太少，偏重于条文的解释，使听众感觉枯燥，不易接受。
    四、主动联系各有关部门，运用各种组织力量，有力的推动这一运动作得不够。虽然取得了工商联合会、店员工会的配合，但对各税务所与各行业公会、店员分会的密切联系和具体布置贯彻得不够，因而未能更广泛的发挥组织作用，有力的开展这一工作。
    有了几点初步体会
    在二十五天的工作中，我们有了以下几点初步的体会：
    一、此次自查漏税申报补缴工作，不仅教育了群众，同时也教育与提高了税务工作人员。由于这一工作是群众路线的，互相研究的方法，不但税务工作人员向群众宣传教育讲解税收政策法令，同时，群众也向税务工作人员提出了许多问题，因而就迫使税务工作人员抓紧学习，以便解决这些问题。这样，对税务工作人员的教育是起了一定的推动作用。这不但是一个成功的工作经验，而且也是税务工作人员面向群众，向群众学习，加强群众观念的重要方法。
    二、这一工作开始时，必须有充分的准备，多开会，多研究，讨论。由于这是一新的工作，缺乏经验，必须每天晚上汇报一次情况，时间不宜过长，解决工作中发生的问题。这样作，在初期是完全必要的，否则，会使具体领导工作人员感觉不知从何作起，随着工作的进展及经验的增多，可以适当的将会议减少。
    三、学习与自查补税工作要很好的结合起来。在初期有些工商业户，认为必须全部学完后再自查，因而在学习过程中申报补缴者很少，不能把学习与实际工作联系起来。经纠正后，补税者立即增加，同时，在学习中提出更多的实际问题，克服了学习与自查补税工作的脱节。
    四、耐心的讲明政策法令，及时的打破其思想顾虑。有些工商业户，对自查漏税申报补缴认识不足，不能直接提出自己的问题，存在着怕处罚的思想，有些怕暴露了自己的真实情况，成为缉私对象，即找亲友代为补税。这些顾虑，必须在学习时彻底说明自查补税的意义，防止在小问题上打圈子，并避免操之过急的形式主义的作风。在讲解各种政策税法时，要有系统的联系具体税目（如讲印花税时，开办订合同、建立账簿、买卖货物的各种单据凭证等，说明那些应贴花）。在讨论时，要详细说明新民主主义的五种经济统筹兼顾，分工合作，各得其所的经济政策，很明确的联系实际进行教育，打破其思想顾虑。
    编者按：青岛市税务局采用的“自查漏税、申报补缴”的办法值得各地税局参考。这个办法的好处是：贯彻群众路线，改善干部与群众的关系，因此增加了国家财政收入。这比用单纯的行政命令、强调法制的办法好得多。但各地采用这个办法时，必须如青岛市一样，首先做好三项重要工作。否则将使“自查补缴”陷于自流，不能收到预期的效果。
