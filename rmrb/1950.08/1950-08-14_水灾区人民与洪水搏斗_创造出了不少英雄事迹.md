Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: Since the beginning of the flood season, many areas in the river basins across the country have suffered from floods due to excessive torrents and levee breaches. The Huai River basin in northern Anhui Province is the most severely affected. However, the people in the disaster areas were not intimidated by the disaster. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, after overcoming pessimistic thoughts, they are fighting against the floods and have created many moving heroic deeds.
　　
During the evening of July 13th, when a storm was raging, and the Sha River's water level suddenly rose, Ma Jixun, the district worker of the Huiliu District in Fuyang County, northern Anhui, immediately led more than ten militiamen to the dangerous section of Lianjiagou in Zhao Ji Township of the district. While calming the panicked emotions of the masses, he ordered the bell to be rung and shots to be fired to sound the alarm. People from several nearby villages, hearing the alarm, rushed over with shovels, baskets, and straw bundles. The embankment immediately became a flurry of activity. However, the waves were high, and the water was rapid, making it difficult to secure the wooden stakes. Ma Jixun immediately led the militiamen to lie down at the breach, forming a human dam. At that time, the wind was strong, the rain was heavy, and the sky was pitch black, but they fearlessly persisted in the water for three hours. The water level finally subsided. Later, they used wheat straw and wooden stakes to block the breach, turning the danger into safety and protecting more than ten villages in the district from flooding.

After the Feng River in the Chengguan District of Lingbi County, northern Anhui, breached its banks from the 10th to the 15th of last month, the responsible comrades of the district immediately organized 48 rescue team members from nearby villages to fight in the water for six days and six nights to urgently repair the breach. After the 48 rescue team members arrived at the dangerous section, they immediately dived into the water one after another to find a foundation for the stakes. Then, in the midst of the storm, they held fifty-pound hammers and stood on the bow of the boat to drive the stakes. After driving the stakes, they competed to carry three-hundred-pound bags of earth to fill the gap. Because of their courageous and tireless struggle against the waves, they finally blocked the breach and greatly encouraged the confidence of the disaster victims.

When the Chaobai and Xin Rivers in Xianghe County, Hebei Province, were in danger on July 19 due to the rapid rise of the water level, Wang Qijiang, a Communist Party member of the Ji (County) Luan (County) River Affairs Bureau, first jumped into the water without regard for his personal safety, using a large pot to block the leak. Zhang Ruiding, a student at the Hebei Provincial Party School, and Gao Jianxin, director of the county supply and marketing cooperative, also successively went into the water to block the opening. Fifty sailors from the Ji Luan River Affairs Bureau jumped into the water together to rescue the situation before the boat had even stopped. Their heroic behavior motivated a large number of workers to take action immediately, driving stakes and planting willows. Finally, the breach was blocked, preventing a disaster.

　　水灾区人民与洪水搏斗  创造出了不少英雄事迹
    【新华社十一日讯】全国各江河流域自入汛期以来，不少地区因洪水过猛，河堤漫决成灾。其中以皖北淮河流域灾情最重。但灾区人民并没有被灾难吓倒。他们在共产党和人民政府领导下，在克服了悲观思想之后，正在与洪水搏斗，并已创造出不少动人的英雄事迹。
    皖北阜阳县洄溜区区工作员马继勋，在七月十三日风暴雨急的傍晚，当沙河水势陡涨时，即刻带领十多个民兵赶到该区赵集乡连家沟出险处。他一面稳定群众的慌乱情绪，一面命令敲钟、打枪发出警报。附近几个庄上的人听到警报后都扛锹担筐，抬着秸捆子赶来。堤岸上人们立时像穿梭似地忙了起来。但是浪高水急，木桩打不稳。马继勋立即带领民兵在决口处睡下，筑成一段肉堤。当时风大雨紧，天黑如漆，但他们却毫无畏惧地在水中坚持了三个钟头。水头终于低下去了。后来又用麦秸木桩堵好缺口，使出险处转危为安，保护了该区十多个村庄免遭水害。
    皖北灵璧县城关区凤河自上月十日至十五日决堤后，该区负责同志为了紧急抢救险口，立即在附近村庄组织了四十八名抢险队员，在水中奋斗了六天六夜，终于堵住险口。四十八个抢险队员到达险口后立即先后沉入水底，寻找桩地。然后又在暴风雨中持着五十斤重的大锤，站在船头打桩。打桩完毕，又比赛扛三百斤重的土袋，进行补口。由于他们这样奋勇不懈地与水浪战斗，终于堵住险口，而且大大地鼓励了灾民的信心。
    河北香河县潮白河、新河在七月十九日因水势猛涨出险时，蓟（县）滦（县）河务局共产党员王其江首先奋不顾身地跳下水去，头顶大锅堵塞漏洞。河北省委党校学员张瑞亭，县供销合作社主任高建新等也相继下水堵塞洞口。从蓟滦河务局赶来五十名水手未等船停就一齐下水合力抢救。他们这种英勇的行为，带动了大批民工立即行动起来，打桩挂柳。终于堵住决口，未使成灾。
