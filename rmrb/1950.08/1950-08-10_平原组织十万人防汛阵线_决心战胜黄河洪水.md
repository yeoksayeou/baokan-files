　　Pingyuan Organizes 100,000-Strong Flood Defense Line
    Determined to Conquer Yellow River Floods
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Pingyuan Province Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters has currently organized a 100,000-strong mass flood defense line, determined to conquer the floods. The province has now made flood prevention one of its current central tasks. According to preliminary statistics, the flood prevention organization already has over a thousand cadres, over a thousand long-term flood prevention workers, over 40,000 emergency rescue teams and temporary flood prevention workers, and a reserve force of 60,000 people. Villages within ten *li* of the riverbanks have all established flood prevention organizations. Long-term flood prevention workers are all on the levees; emergency rescue teams and temporary flood prevention workers have been fully organized, and all young and middle-aged members of the militia have joined the reserve force, forming an 800-kilometer Yellow River flood defense line within Pingyuan Province. Under the leadership of flood prevention headquarters at all levels, the people of the entire province are determined to prevent levee breaches even in the event of a flow rate of 17,000 cubic meters per second or even greater floods.
    The autumn seedlings along the Yellow River this year are the best in ten years. What the masses are most concerned about right now is "the issue of the Yellow River breaching its banks." Leading officials at all levels have also used examples of the heavy disasters suffered in the past when the Yellow River breached its banks to overcome the paralyzing thoughts of some of the masses, so most people are very active in flood prevention work and enthusiastically sign up to join the reserve force. For example, the chairman of Ximenglou Village in the Second District of Shou Zhang said at a village cadre meeting: "I would rather die of exhaustion on the levee than be drowned by the flood."
    In order to strengthen flood prevention projects, the Changyuan Dam in the upper reaches has been rebuilt, and the North Bank Henan Dam (Guantai to Zhengzhou Railway Bridge) and the Jin Dam (Puyang Liutun to Shou Zhang Taochengbu) have been repaired, totaling 350,000 cubic meters of earthwork, most of which was completed by the end of July. At present, various flood prevention materials have been fully prepared, and flood prevention organizations at all levels have established a work responsibility system and sent inspection teams to repeatedly inspect. The more than 700 badger and fox dens discovered in the previous inspection have been required to be completely eliminated in early August. Fengqiu County has mobilized 4,000 people to carry out large-scale badger hole digging and patching work. Also, the Guanmeng Dam of the Changyuan Dam is a sand dam, so if it encounters too much flood, it may not be safe. Therefore, this year it has been determined that the Changyuan Dam is the focus of defense. In terms of rescue preparation work, although more than 500 public and private boats have been organized, it is far from the actual needs, and the specific organization work should be strengthened to fully deploy and ensure that no problems occur in the rescue work when the flood suddenly arrives.

### 平原组织十万人防汛阵线  决心战胜黄河洪水

　　平原组织十万人防汛阵线
    决心战胜黄河洪水
    【本报讯】平原省黄河防汛指挥部目前已组织起十万群众的人防阵线，决心战胜洪水。该省现已将防汛作为当前中心工作之一。据初步统计，防汛组织已有干部千余名、长期防汛员千余名、抢险队与临时防汛员四万余人、后备队六万人。两岸沿河堤十里以内的村庄，均已建立防汛组织。长期防汛员已全部上堤；抢险队与临时防汛员已经编组完备，自卫队的青壮年全部参加了后备队，已在平原省境内形成八百公里的黄河人防阵线。全省人民在各级防汛指挥部的领导下，决心做到在一万七千秒立方公尺流量甚至更大洪水的情况下不发生溃堤。
    黄河两岸今年的秋苗是十年来所未有的好年景。群众目前所最关心的就是“黄河决口问题”。各级领导上又以过去黄河决口时所遭受的惨重灾害的实例，打通了部分群众的麻痹思想，所以一般人对防汛工作都非常积极，踊跃报名参加后备队。如寿张二区西孟楼村主席在村干大会上说：“宁在堤上累死，不能叫洪水淹死。”
    为了加强防汛工程，又加修了上游长垣大堤并补修北岸河南大堤（贯台至郑州铁桥）、金堤（濮阳柳屯至寿张陶城埠），共三十五万土方工程，七月底已大部完工。目前各种防汛物料均已准备齐全，各级防汛组织已建立工作责任制，并派检查组反复检查。前次检查所发现的七百余处獾狐洞穴，限定在八月上旬完全消灭。封邱县已动员四千余人大规模进行挖补獾洞工作。又长垣堤的贯孟堤因系沙堤，如遇过大洪水恐不保险，所以今年确定以长垣堤为防守重点。在救护准备工作上，虽然组织了公私船只五百余只，但离实际需要甚远，应加强具体组织工作，使其全面展开，保证洪水突然到来时，救护工作不发生问题。
