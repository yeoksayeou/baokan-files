　　Beijing Municipal Consultative Committee Holds Symposium
    Discussing Further Expansion of Signature Campaign
    Striving for Participation of Citizens in Remote Urban Areas
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee convened a symposium at 10:00 AM on the 22nd, attended by representatives from municipal-level democratic parties and people's organizations, to discuss the continued unfolding of the peace signature campaign. At the meeting, Secretary-General Yan of the Consultative Committee reported that the number of signatures in the city had reached 1.47 million. It was estimated that, including children over ten years old in the suburbs, there were still more than 400,000 people who had not participated in the signature campaign, requiring continued efforts from various democratic parties and people's organizations to secure their participation. Subsequently, representatives from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Women's Federation, the Student Federation, the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party reported on the progress and shared experiences of the peace signature campaign in their respective units. Finally, it was decided that all units would continue to strive to complete the widespread signature collection from unorganized masses in remote urban areas before the end of August, and widely establish signature tables in public entertainment venues to promote the campaign and collect signatures. The number of signatures would be uniformly calculated by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
