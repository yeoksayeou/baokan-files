Beijing Public Health Bureau Holds Western Medicine Examination

    In order to enable Western medicine practitioners in Beijing who have not yet obtained licenses to obtain legal operating qualifications, the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau held a Western medicine practitioner examination on the 4th of this month. The names of the qualified personnel will be announced in the coming days. According to the person in charge of the bureau, those who participated in the examination but did not pass, except for those with special circumstances, will generally not be banned from operating if they are already practicing. Business learning will be organized in the future to improve their skills, and then the examination will be conducted again; however, those who do not meet the qualifications for a license but want to start a new business will not be allowed.
