　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 4th (TASS dispatch): Moscow newspapers have published numerous articles and letters from the Soviet people. Workers, collective farmers, scientists, and writers unanimously support the Soviet government's Stalinist peaceful foreign policy, denounce the instigators of a new war by Britain and the United States, and declare their unwavering determination to uphold world peace.

  Famous Writer Gladkov
　　Famous Soviet writer Gladkov published an article in *Pravda*, discussing the Soviet people's enthusiasm for peaceful construction labor, stating: We do not want war because we are building a new life, because we want to change the face of the earth and make her a kind mother to working humanity. We want to coexist peacefully with all nations so that our country can rationally contribute to all working people. To wage a tireless struggle against those who demand to rule the world is the most important thing for each of us today. The movement of all peoples striving for peace, headed by the Soviet Union, the standard-bearer of peace, has guaranteed the victory of all peoples in this struggle against the common enemy of mankind.

  Famous Writer Fedin
　　Soviet writer Fedin, in an article titled "The Writer's Task in the Struggle for Peace" in *Pravda*, pointed out: The idea of international peace cannot but dominate the minds of workers in literature and art. Peace is the primary condition for the existence and development of culture. Fedin pointed out that the Soviet Union is the great standard-bearer of peace, and international peace is the slogan revealed on the banner of the October Socialist Revolution. Fedin continued that the Soviet Union's humanitarian slogan has won the approval of the greatest writers in Europe and America. Romain Rolland and Anatole France, George Bernard Shaw and Theodore Dreiser, Henri Barbusse and Martin Andersen Nexø proudly declared that they were friends of the young Soviet society. Fedin said: The speculators in the literary world and the heads of newspaper trusts have praised and will praise the militaristic cannibals. And a person who deserves to be called a writer has praised and will praise peace.

　　Fedin went on to talk about the enormous enthusiasm that the Stockholm Appeal has aroused in every corner of the world. He emphasized that every signature on the declaration is a test, testing the individual's own determination to uphold peace, and this determination comes from his own will to uphold peace, from his own resentment towards the warmongers.

  Scientist Lysenko
　　Outstanding Soviet scientist, Academician Lysenko, said in a letter published in *Pravda*: Just as the British and American imperialists are trying to incite the flames of a new war, Soviet peaceful science is reaching an extraordinary height. Soviet scientists will work tirelessly for the great happiness of peaceful labor, for the great happiness of science that is constantly developing along the path illuminated by the genius of Stalin!

  Labor Hero Angelina
　　Socialist Labor Hero, tractor team leader Angelina, talked in *Pravda* about the great unity of the Soviet working people in the struggle for peace. She said that we, the billions of good men and women who signed the Stockholm Appeal, will never allow the instigators of a new war to disrupt the peaceful life of all the peoples of the world. We believe that peace will surely triumph throughout the world. Whether they are coal miners, steelworkers, tractor and loom manufacturers; or light industry workers who produce textiles, clothing, and shoes for the people - no Soviet citizen needs war. And we will send out a magnificent cry to defend peace, telling the aggressors: Do not interfere in Korea! Tell you warmongers: There are still billions of good men and women in the world. The great Soviet Union stands at the forefront of the powerful camp of fighters for peace.

  Stakhanovite Turner Bykov
　　Soviet Supreme Soviet Deputy, Stakhanovite turner Bykov of the Moscow Machine Tool Factory, wrote in *Izvestia* that we Soviet people regard labor, free creative labor, labor for the benefit of the motherland, as the true meaning of our lives. In every city and village, in every factory and manufacturing plant, in every agency and collective farm – everywhere in our country, there is a flurry of construction work. We are building communism. Our country is an indestructible fortress of world peace. The working people of the world know this deeply. They believe that peace will triumph over war. Peace will triumph because the Soviet Union, the leader of all working people - the great Stalin is guarding it.
