The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, in order to solve the problem of out-of-school children, has recently decided to add 241 classes and establish 16 new primary schools in municipal primary schools located in areas where out-of-school children are relatively concentrated, which can enroll a total of 19,000 out-of-school children.

According to the different conditions in each district, the specific allocation of increased classes and new schools is as follows: 34 classes will be added in District 1; 18 classes in District 2; 29 classes and 3 new primary schools in District 3; 37 classes and 2 new primary schools in District 4; 8 classes and 2 new primary schools in District 5; 15 classes and 2 new primary schools in District 6; 10 classes and 3 new primary schools in District 7; 9 classes and 1 new primary school in District 8; 11 classes and 1 new primary school in District 9; 29 classes in District 10; 3 classes and 1 new primary school in District 11; 6 classes in District 12; 12 classes and 1 new primary school in District 13; 11 classes in District 14; 2 classes in District 15; and 4 classes in District 16.

The increased classes and newly established municipal primary schools have now begun enrollment. Registration is scheduled for the 27th to 30th of this month, and examinations will be held on the 31st (the date of recruitment and level placement examinations for municipal primary schools that are not adding classes is the same as above). In order to take care of the children of workers, peasants, revolutionary martyrs, and military personnel when they enroll in school, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has specifically stipulated that children of workers and peasants who hold certificates from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions or the offices of trade unions and farmers' associations in each district, and children of impoverished revolutionary martyrs and military personnel who hold certificates from the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, will be given appropriately lowered admission standards. General applicants must hold an "Out-of-School Certificate" or "Poverty Certificate" issued by the local police station in each district in order to apply for the examination, so as to prevent students from private primary schools from transferring to municipal primary schools in large numbers, which would affect private schools, and at the same time enable the children of impoverished working people who truly suffer from being out of school to have the opportunity to attend school.

　　京增班增校招收失学儿童
    明天开始报名，三十一日考试工农烈军属子弟均予适当照顾
    京市教育局为解决失学儿童入学问题，顷决定于城内和郊区失学儿童比较集中地区的市立小学内增添二四一班，增设小学十六处，共可招收一万九千名失学儿童入学。
    根据各区不同情况，增班增校的具体分配情形为：一区增三四班；二区增十八班；三区增二九班，另设小学三所；四区增三七班，另设小学二所；五区增八班，另设小学二所；六区增十五班，另设小学二所；七区增十班，另设小学三所；八区增九班，另设小学一所；九区增十一班，另设小学一所；十区增二九班；十一区增三班，另设小学一所，十二区增六班；十三区增十二班，另设小学一所；十四区增十一班；十五区增二班；十六区增四班。
    增班及新设的各市立小学现已开始招生，均定于本月二十七日至三十日报名，三十一日考试（不增班市小之招考编级生日期，与上相同）。为照顾工农及贫寒烈、军属子弟入学起见，市文教局特规定：凡持有市总工会或各区工会办事处及农会证明信的工农子弟和持有市民政局证件的贫寒烈、军属子弟均予适当降低录取标准；一般投考学生，须持有各区派出所开具之“失学证明书”或“贫寒证明书”才能投考，以防止私立小学的学生大批转入市立小学，影响私立学校，同时也使真正饱受失学痛苦的贫寒劳动人民子弟能够得到就学的机会。
