    The history of the Russian workers' press is inextricably linked with the history of the democratic and socialist movements. Therefore, only by understanding the main stages of the liberation movement can one truly understand the preparation and emergence of the workers' press and why it followed this path and not another.

    The Russian liberation movement went through three main stages, corresponding to the three main classes of Russian society that marked the movement. These three main stages are: (1) the aristocratic period (roughly from 1825 to 1861); (2) the raznochintsy or bourgeois-democratic period (roughly from 1861 to 1895); (3) the proletarian period (from 1895 to the present).

    The most outstanding activists of the aristocratic period were the Decembrists and Herzen. During this period, under the system of serfdom, there was no question of the working class separating itself from the "lowly," "black," and disenfranchised masses of serfs. The precursor to the workers' (proletarian-democratic or social-democratic) press at that time was the general democratic uncensored press, led by Herzen's "The Bell"①.

    Just as the Decembrists awakened Herzen, Herzen and his "The Bell" helped awaken the raznochintsy. These raznochintsy were the educated representatives of the liberal-democratic bourgeoisie; they belonged to the ranks of officials, petty bourgeois, merchants, and peasants, rather than to the aristocracy. In our liberation movement, the raznochintsy completely excluded the aristocracy, and their precursor was Belinsky, who was still under the system of serfdom. His famous "Letter to Gogol"②, which summarized his literary activities, is one of the excellent works in the uncensored democratic press. It still maintains great and vivid significance to this day.

    The collapse of serfdom allowed the raznochintsy to emerge as the main mass activists of the general liberation movement, especially as the main activists of the democratic uncensored press. Populism became the dominant journalistic direction suitable for the views of the raznochintsy. As a social current, Populism could never clearly distinguish itself from right-wing liberalism and left-wing anarchism. However, Chernyshevsky, although following Herzen in developing Populism, took a big step forward compared to Herzen. Chernyshevsky was a much more thorough and militant democrat. His works exuded the atmosphere of class struggle. He vigorously implemented the line of exposing the betrayal of liberalism, which the Constitutional Democrats and liquidators still hate to this day. He was an exceptionally profound critic of capitalism, although he held utopian socialist ideas.

    The 1860s and 1870s saw many uncensored journalistic works that had begun to penetrate the "masses," with militant democratic and utopian socialist content.

    And among the activists of that era, the workers Pyotr Alekseev and Stepan Khalturin and others occupied prominent positions. However, the proletarian tributary could not be separated from the overall populist torrent. This division became possible only after the Marxist current in Russia had been ideologically determined ("Emancipation of Labor" group, 1883) and the continuous workers' movement had begun due to social democracy (the St. Petersburg workers' strike of 1895-1896).

    But before turning to the era in which the Russian workers' press truly began, we can cite some materials that clearly express the class differences between the movements of the three historical periods mentioned above. These are some materials on the distribution of those tried for treason (political) crimes by identity and by profession (i.e., by class). Among one hundred such people:
                                         Aristocrats           Petty Bourgeois and Peasants            Peasants       Workers       Intellectuals
　　1827-1846......76                     23                                                               
    1884-1890......30.6                  46.6                                          7.1                   15.1              73.2
    1901-1903......10.7                  80.9                                          9.0                   46.1              36.7
    1905-1906......9.1                   87.7                                          24.2                  47.4              28.4

    In the aristocratic period, the period of serfdom (1827-1846), the aristocrats, who accounted for a very small percentage of the population, accounted for a large proportion (76%) of "political prisoners." In the populist period, the period of the raznochintsy (1884-1890; unfortunately, there are no similar materials for the 1860s and 1870s), the aristocracy retreated to a secondary position but still accounted for a large percentage (30.6%). Intellectuals accounted for the vast majority of participants in the democratic movement (73.2%).

    The period from 1901 to 1903, precisely the period of the first Marxist political newspaper, the old "Iskra," saw workers (46.1%) surpass intellectuals (36.7%) under the complete democratization of the movement (aristocrats accounted for 10.7%, "non-privileged" accounted for 80.9%).

    Let us point out one step ahead: the period of the first mass movement showed that the change only lay in the fact that intellectuals (28.4% vs. 36.7%) were excluded by peasants (24.2% vs. 9.0%).

    The founders of the Russian Social Democratic movement were the "Emancipation of Labor" group, which emerged abroad in 1883. The group's uncensored works printed abroad were the first to systematically present Marxist ideas and all their practical conclusions. The experience of the whole world has shown that only Marxist ideas can correctly express the essence and tasks of the workers' movement. During the twelve years from 1883 to 1895, the publication of the Social Democratic newspaper "Rabochiy" in St. Petersburg in 1885 was almost the only attempt to create a Social Democratic workers' press in Russia. This newspaper was of course uncensored, but it only published two issues. Without a mass workers' movement, the workers' press could not develop widely.

    From 1895-1896, from the period of the famous St. Petersburg strikes, the mass workers' movement began, and the Social Democrats also participated. In a fundamental sense, this period was the time when the Russian workers' press appeared. The main works of the workers' press at that time were uncensored leaflets, mostly not printed on printing presses but on mimeographs, written for "economic" (and also non-economic) agitation, that is, describing the needs and demands of workers in various industrial factories and various industrial sectors. Needless to say, such works could not exist without the most active participation of advanced workers in writing and disseminating them. Among the workers active at that time, Vasily Andreyevich Shelgunov and Ivan Vasilyevich Babushkin can be mentioned. Shelgunov later went blind and could not be as active as before. Babushkin was an enthusiastic "Iskraist" (1900-1903) and "Bolshevik," who was shot for participating in the Siberian uprising in late 1905 or early 1906.

    These leaflets were printed by Social Democratic groups, cells, and organizations, which from the end of 1895 mostly began to be called "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class." In 1898, a congress of representatives of Social Democratic organizations from various regions founded the "Russian Social Democratic Labor Party."

    Following the leaflets came uncensored workers' newspapers - for example, the St. Petersburg "Rabochiy Listok"③ of 1897 and the "Rabochaya Mysl'"④ newspaper in the same place, which soon moved abroad. The Social Democratic newspapers in various regions, from this time until almost the revolution, were uncensored - naturally, they were often destroyed, but they reappeared time and time again throughout Russia.

    The workers' leaflets and Social Democratic newspapers of that time, that is, twenty years ago, are collectively the direct precursors of the current workers' press: the same "exposures" of factories, the same news about "economic" struggles, the same principled explanations of the tasks of the workers' movement from a Marxist and thoroughly democratic standpoint - and finally, the same two main factions in the workers' press, the Marxist faction and the opportunist faction.

    The outstanding fact that has not yet been fully appreciated is that once the Russian mass workers' movement emerged (1895-1896), it immediately had a division between the Marxist and opportunist factions, a division that varied in form, appearance, etc., but whose essence remained the same from 1894 to 1914. It is evident that in the internal struggles of the Social Democrats, it is precisely this division, and not any other, that has deep social and class roots.

    The aforementioned "Rabochaya Mysl'" represented the opportunist faction of that time, the so-called "Economism." In the debates of activists in the workers' movement in various regions, this faction had already formed in 1894-1895. And abroad (the awakening of Russian workers from 1896 onwards caused the prevalence of Social Democratic works), the emergence and unity of the "Economists" ended in a split in the spring of 1900 (that is, this split occurred before the emergence of "Iskra," because the first issue of "Iskra" was published at the end of 1900).

    The history of the workers' press from 1894 to 1914, these twenty years, is the history of the two factions of Russian Marxism and Russian (more correctly: Russian) Social Democracy. To understand the history of the Russian workers' press, one must know not only, but even not necessarily know, the names of various newspapers (these names can tell today's readers nothing and can only confuse their minds), but rather the content, nature, and ideological line of each part of the Social Democratic Party.

    The main organ of the "Economists" was "Rabochaya Mysl'" (1897-1900) and the magazine "Rabocheye Delo"⑤ (1898-1901). The leaders of "Rabocheye Delo" were Krichevsky (who later went over to the syndicalists), Martynov (a famous Menshevik and now a liquidator), and Akimov (now a "non-aligned Social Democrat" who agrees with the liquidators in all important aspects).

    The first to fight against the Economists were only Plekhanov and the entire "Emancipation of Labor" group (the magazine "Rabotnik" and others, etc.), and later "Iskra" (from 1900 to August 1903, before the convocation of the Second Congress of the Social Democratic Labor Party). What was the essence of Economism?

    The "Economists" verbally tried especially hard to defend the mass nature and independence of the workers' movement, insisting that "economic" agitation was of paramount importance, and insisting on a mitigated or gradual transition to political agitation. Readers can see that this is still that beloved set of empty talk that the liquidators boast about. In fact, what the "Economists" were implementing was a liberal workers' policy, the essence of which was briefly expressed by one of the leaders of "Economism" at that time, Prokopovich: "Economics - for the workers, political struggle - for the liberals." The "Economists" made more noise than anyone about the independence of the workers and the mass movement, but in fact they were the opportunist, petty-bourgeois-intellectual wing of the workers' movement.

    Conscious workers accounted for forty-six of the hundred political prisoners in 1901-1903, while intellectuals accounted for thirty-seven; the vast majority of these conscious workers stood on the side of the old "Iskra" against opportunism. The three years of activity of "Iskra" (1901-1903) formulated the program of the Social Democratic Party, its tactical basis, and the forms of combining the economic and political struggles of the workers on a thorough Marxist basis. Around "Iskra" and under its ideological leadership, the workers' press grew on a large scale in the years before the revolution. There were a great many uncensored leaflets and illegal printing presses, and they increased rapidly throughout Russia.

    The complete victory of "Iskra" over "Economism," the complete victory of the proletariat's thorough tactics over the intellectual opportunist tactics in 1903, caused a surge of "fellow travelers" to flow into the ranks of the Social Democratic Party, and opportunism revived in the form of "Menshevism" on the basis of the spirit of "Iskra," as a part of it.

    Menshevism was formed at the Second Congress of the Social Democratic Labor Party (August 1903) by a minority of "Iskraists" (hence the name Menshevism) and all the opportunists who opposed "Iskra." The "Mensheviks" returned to "Economism," of course in a slightly altered form; all the "Economists" who fell behind the movement, led by Martynov, joined the ranks of the "Mensheviks."

    The main organ of "Menshevism" was the new "Iskra," which was published under a new editorial board from November 1903: "There is a chasm between the old 'Iskra' and the new 'Iskra'" - the enthusiastic Menshevik Trotsky bluntly stated at that time. The main organs of the Bolsheviks, who advocated thorough Marxist tactics and were loyal to the old "Iskra," were "Vpered"⑥ and "Proletariy"⑦ (1905).

    From the point of view of truly connecting with the masses and expressing the tactics of the proletarian masses, the revolutionary years of 1905-1907 were a test of the two main factions in the Social Democratic movement and the workers' press, the Menshevik faction and the Bolshevik faction. Open Social Democratic journalism could not have emerged suddenly in the autumn of 1905 if the activities of advanced workers closely connected with the masses had not prepared a base for it. And if the open Social Democratic journalism of 1905, 1906, and 1907 was the journalism of two tendencies and two factions, then this could only be because the petty-bourgeois line and the proletarian line in the workers' movement of that era were clearly distinct.

    Open workers' journalism appeared in three upsurges and relatively "free" periods: the spring of 1905 (the Bolshevik "Novaya Zhizn'"⑧, the Menshevik "Nachalo"⑨ - among many newspapers, we only point out the main ones), the spring of 1906 (the Bolshevik "Volna"⑩, "Ekho"⑾ etc., the Menshevik "Narodnaya Duma"⑿ etc.), and the spring of 1907.

    The essence of the Menshevik tactics of this era was recently expressed by Martov himself in the following words:

    "'Menshevism cannot see that in the current crisis of the proletariat' there is any possibility of effective participation other than helping the bourgeois democrats to realize their plans, squeezing the reactionary part of the propertied classes out of the state power - but this help should be implemented by the proletariat while maintaining its complete political independence." (LubaKin: "In the Book Thicket," Volume II, page 772)

    This tactic of "helping" the liberals is in fact equivalent to the workers' dependence on the liberals, in fact it is a liberal workers' policy. Conversely, the tactics of Bolshevism guaranteed the independence of the working class in the bourgeois crisis by engaging in the struggle to carry the crisis to the end, by exposing the betrayal of liberalism, and by educating and uniting the petty bourgeoisie (especially the rural petty bourgeoisie) to oppose these betrayals.

    Everyone knows - and the Mensheviks themselves, up to the current liquidators Korltsov, Levitsky, etc., have repeatedly admitted - that in these years (1905-1907) the worker masses followed the Bolsheviks. Bolshevism expressed the proletarian essence of the movement, while Menshevism expressed the opportunist, petty-bourgeois-intellectual wing of the movement.

    We cannot explain in detail here the content and significance of the tactics of the two factions in the workers' press. We should limit ourselves to accurately determining the basic facts and determining the main lines of historical development.

    The Russian workers' press has nearly a hundred years of history - first the history of the preparatory stage, that is, not the history of the workers' movement, not the history of the proletarian movement, but the history of the "general democratic," that is, the bourgeois democratic liberation movement - and then twenty years of its own history, the history of the proletariat, proletarian democracy, or social democracy.

    Nowhere did the proletarian movement ever arise "suddenly," appearing in the world with a pure class face completely, like Minerva emerging from Jupiter's⒀ head. Only through the long-term struggle and hard work of the most advanced workers, all conscious workers, can the class movement of the proletariat be separated from and consolidated from all kinds of petty-bourgeois mixtures, restrictions, narrowness, and distortions. The working class lives shoulder-to-shoulder with the petty bourgeoisie, and the petty bourgeoisie sends batches of reserve forces into the ranks of the proletariat in bankruptcy. However, Russia is the most petty-bourgeois, most petty-urban country among capitalist countries, a country that is now only experiencing the era of capitalist revolution, an era that, for example, was the 17th century in England and the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries in France.

    Conscious workers, while struggling for their own flesh-and-blood cause - running the workers' press, establishing, consolidating, and developing the workers' press - will not forget the twenty-year history of Russian Marxism and Social Democratic journalism.

    What harms the workers' movement is those neurasthenic intellectual friends of the workers' movement who obliterate the internal struggles of the Social Democratic Party and fill the air with their cries and appeals for obliterating internal struggles. These are good but useless people, and their cries are also useless.

    Only by studying the history of how Marxism fought against opportunism, only by truly and meticulously understanding how the independent proletarian democrats separated themselves from the petty-bourgeois petty citizens, can advanced workers finally consolidate their consciousness and their workers' press.

    (1) "The Bell" - a political magazine; its inscription was "Calling to the Living!". Edited by Herzen and Ogarev, printed by Herzen's "Russian Free Printing House," from April 1857 to 1865 in London, and from 1865 to 1868 in Geneva. In 1868, the magazine was published in French, with a Russian supplement.
    Lenin gave a characteristic description of "The Bell" in his article "In Memory of Herzen" (see "Complete Works of Lenin," 4th edition, Volume 18, pages 9-15).

    (2) "Letter to Gogol" - written by Belinsky in July 1847: first published by Herzen in the magazine "Polar Star" in 1855. (See Belinsky's Selected Works in Three Volumes, Volume 3, 1948, pages 707-715).

    (3) "Rabochiy Listok" - an illegal newspaper; the organ of the St. Petersburg "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class." Only two issues were published: the first issue was mimeographed in Russia in February 1897 (dated January on the newspaper), with 300-400 copies printed; the second issue was published in Geneva (Switzerland) in September 1897.

    (4) "Rabochaya Mysl'" - a newspaper that openly practiced the opportunist views of the "Economists"; published from October 1897 to December 1902. A total of sixteen issues were published.

    (5) "Rabocheye Delo" - an irregular organ of the Union of Russian Social Democrats ("Economists") abroad. Published in Geneva from 1899 to 1902.

    (6) "Vpered" - an illegal Bolshevik newspaper; published in Geneva from December 22, 1904 (January 4, 1905) to May 5 (18), 1905; a total of eighteen issues were published. The organizer, ideological inspirer and leader of the newspaper was Lenin. Vorovsky, Olminsky, and Lunacharsky also participated in editing the newspaper.
    The Third Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party pointed out in a special resolution the outstanding role played by "Vpered" in restoring the party spirit, handling and explaining the tactical issues raised by the revolutionary movement, and fighting against Menshevism, and expressed gratitude to the editors of the newspaper.

    (7) "Proletariy" - an illegal Bolshevik weekly newspaper, the central organ of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, founded in accordance with the resolution of the Third Congress of the Party. The plenary session of the Party Central Committee on April 27 (May 10), 1905 appointed Lenin as the editor-in-chief of the central organ.
    "Proletariy" was published in Geneva from May 14 (27) to November 12 (25), 1905. A total of twenty-six issues were published. Vorovsky, Lunacharsky, and Olminsky regularly participated in editing the newspaper. "Proletariy" continued the line of Lenin's old "Iskra" and completely inherited the Bolshevik "Vpered." Lenin published more than fifty essays and commentaries in the newspaper. Lenin's articles in "Proletariy" were often reprinted by local Bolshevik newspapers and issued as leaflets. "Proletariy" established close cooperation with the illegal Bolshevik newspaper "Proletariatis Brdzola" - the organ of the South Caucasus League of the Social Democratic Labor Party, edited by Stalin; Tsurulukidze and Shaumyan also participated in the editorial board of "Proletariatis Brdzola." After Lenin returned to Russia in November 1905, "Proletariy" was soon discontinued. The last two issues (the 25th and 26th) were edited and published by Vorovsky.

    (8) "Novaya Zhizn'" - the first legal Bolshevik newspaper; published daily in St. Petersburg from October 29 (November 9) to December 3 (16), 1905. From the time Lenin arrived in St. Petersburg from abroad, in early November, the newspaper was published under his direct leadership. "Novaya Zhizn'" was in fact the central organ of the Social Democratic Labor Party. Lenin's closest comrades were Vorovsky, Olminsky, Lunacharsky, and others. Gorky actively participated in "Novaya Zhizn'" and gave the newspaper great material help.
    The ninth issue of "Novaya Zhizn'" on November 10, 1905 published Lenin's first published article "On the Reorganization of the Party." He later published more than ten articles. The daily circulation of the newspaper reached 80,000. "Novaya Zhizn'" suffered many repressions. Fifteen of the newspaper's twenty-seven issues were confiscated and destroyed. "Novaya Zhizn'" was closed by the government on December 2 (15) after publishing its twenty-seventh issue. The last issue, the twenty-eighth, was published illegally.

    (9) "Nachalo" - a legal Menshevik daily newspaper; published in St. Petersburg from November to December 1905.

    (10) "Volna" - a legal Bolshevik daily newspaper; published in St. Petersburg from April 26 (May 9) to May 24 (June 6), 1906; a total of twenty-five issues were published. From the ninth issue on May 5 (18), 1906 (after the end of the work of the Fourth Congress and Lenin's arrival from Stockholm), the newspaper was in fact edited by Lenin. The newspaper published more than twenty articles by Lenin. Vorovsky and Olminsky also participated in editing the newspaper. "Volna" suffered many repressions from the police; it was later closed by the Tsarist government; replacing "Volna" was the legal Bolshevik newspaper "Vpered."

    (11) "Ekho" - a legal Bolshevik daily newspaper; published in St. Petersburg from June 22 (July 5) to July 7 (20), replacing "Vpered," which had been closed by the government. A total of fourteen issues were published. The editor was in fact Lenin. Every issue contained an article by Lenin. Lenin directly participated in the work of the newspaper's column "In Newspapers and Magazines."
    Almost every issue of "Ekho" was subjected to repression. The newspaper was closed on the eve of the dissolution of the First State Duma.

    (12) "Narodnaya Duma" - a Menshevik daily newspaper; published in St. Petersburg from March to April 1907.

    (13) In Roman mythology, Jupiter (equivalent to the Greek Zeus) is the god of the heavens and the leader of the gods. Minerva (equivalent to the Greek Athena) is the daughter of Jupiter. Jupiter, fearing that his wife Metis would give birth to a son stronger than him, devoured her. Therefore, Minerva jumped out of Jupiter's head, fully grown and fully armed. She remained a virgin all her life, was the god of lightning, and also the god of wisdom.

　　俄国工人报刊的历史
　　列宁
    原文第一次发表于一九一四年四月二十二日《工人报》。现在根据苏联国家政治书籍出版局一九四八年印行的《列宁全集》第四版第二○卷译出。——编者
    俄国工人报刊的历史是与民主运动和社会主义运动的历史不可分割地联系着的。因此，只有理解了解放运动的主要阶段，才能真正作到理解工人报刊的准备和产生为什么经历了这样的而不是那样的道路。
    俄国解放运动经过了三个主要阶段，这是与那给运动刻下自己标记的俄国社会三个主要阶级相适应的，这三个主要阶段就是：（一）贵族时期（大概从一八二五年到一八六一年）；（二）平民知识分子或资产阶级民主主义时期（大约从一八六一年到一八九五年）；（三）无产阶级时期（从一八九五年到现在）。
    贵族时期最出色的活动家是十二月党人和赫尔岑。在这个时期，在农奴制度之下，根本谈不上工人阶级如何从“卑下的”、“黑色的”、毫无权利的一般农奴阶级群众中划分出来。当时工人的（无产阶级民主主义的或社会民主主义的）报刊的前驱者，是以赫尔岑的“钟”①为首的一般民主主义的不受检查的报刊。
    正如十二月党人唤醒了赫尔岑一样，赫尔岑和他的“钟”帮助唤醒了平民知识分子。这些平民知识分子是自由民主资产阶级受过教育的代表，他们是属于官吏、小市民、商人、农民，而非属于贵族。在我们的解放运动中，平民知识分子对贵族实行完全的排斥，其前驱者就是还处在农奴制度之下的别林斯基。他的总结了自己文艺活动的著名的《给果戈里的信》②，是不受检查的民主报刊中的优秀著作之一。直到现在还保持着巨大的生动的意义。
    农奴制度的崩溃使平民知识分子以一般解放运动的主要群众活动家的资格出现，特别是以民主主义的不受检查的报刊的主要活动家的资格出现。民粹主义成为了适合于平民知识分子观点的占统治地位的报刊方向。作为社会流派，民粹主义永远不能与右的自由主义和左的无政府主义分清界线。但是车尔尼雪夫斯基，虽然跟着赫尔岑发展了民粹主义，却比赫尔岑迈进了一大步。车尔尼雪夫斯基是更彻底得多和更富于战斗性得多的民主主义者。他的著作散播着阶级斗争的气息。他强有力地实行了立宪民主党人和取消派分子直到现在所痛恨的这一条揭发自由主义叛卖行为的路线。他是资本主义的异常深刻的批评家，虽然他有着空想的社会主义思想。
    十九世纪六十年代和七十年代有着好多业已开始深入“群众、具有战斗民主主义和空想社会主义内容的不受检查的报刊作品”。
    而在那个时代的活动家中间占着突出地位的是工人彼得尔·亚列克雪也夫、斯切班·哈图林等人。但是无产阶级的支流在总的民粹主义洪流中还不能划分出来。这个划分之成为可能，只有在俄国马克思主义流派在思想上业已确定（“劳动解放”社，一八八三年）以及不断的工人运动由于社会民主主义而开始了（一八九五——一八九六年的彼得堡工人罢工）之后。
    但在转到俄国工人报刊真正从而开始的这个时代以前，我们可以引证一些明显表示上述三个历史时期的运动间的阶级差别的材料。这就是一些关于因叛国（政治）罪被审判的人们之按身份和按职业（即按阶级）的分配的材料。在一百个这样的人们中间：贵族　　                           小市民和农民一八二七——一八四六年……七六     二三一八八四——一八九○年……三○·六 四六·六一九○一——一九○三年……一○·七 八○·九一九○五——一九○六年……九·一   八七·七农民          工人        知识分子？            ？           ？七·一      一五·一      七三·二九·○      四六·一      三六·七二四·二    四七·四      二八·四
    在贵族时期、农奴时期（一八二七——一八四六年）占人数极小部分的贵族，却占了很大部分（七六％）的“政治犯”。在民粹主义时期、平民知识分子时期（一八八四——一八九○年；关于六十和七十年代，可惜没有类似的材料），贵族退到次要地位，但仍然占很大的百分数（三○·六％）。知识分子占了民主运动参加者的绝大多数（七三·二％）。
    一九○一——一九○三年的时期，正是第一个马克思主义政治报、旧《火星》报的时期，在运动完全民主化之下，工人（四六·一％）已经超过知识分子（三六·七％）（贵族占一○·七％，“非特权者”占八○·九％）。
    我们且提前一步指出：第一个群众运动时期表明了变动只在于知识分子（二八·四％对三六·七％）被农民（二四·二％对九·○％）所排斥。
    俄国社会民主运动的创立者是一八八三年产生于国外的“劳动解放”社。该社不经过检查在国外印行的著作，第一次开始有系统地并且以一切实际的结论来叙述马克思主义思想。全世界的经验表明了：唯有马克思主义思想才能正确地表现工人运动的实质及其任务。从一八八三年到一八九五年这十二年期间，彼得堡在一八八五年之出版社会民主主义的《工人》报，差不多是俄国创办社会民主主义工人报刊的唯一的尝试，这个报纸当然是不受检查的，可是仅仅只出了两期。没有群众性的工人运动，工人报刊就不可能广泛地发展起来。
    从一八九五——一八九六年起，从著名的彼得堡罢工时期起，开始了群众性的工人运动，社会民主派也参加在内。从根本意思上来说，这个时期才是俄国工人报刊出现的时期。当时工人报刊的主要著作是不受检查的传单，大部分不是用铅印机印的而是用油印机印的，是为“经济的”（而且也为非经济的）鼓动而写的，这就是说，是叙述各种工业工厂和各种工业部门的工人们的需要和要求。不用说，没有先进工人最积极地参加编写和传播，这种著作就不能存在。从当时活动的工人中可以举出瓦西里·安得列也维奇·谢尔古诺夫和伊凡·瓦西里耶维支·巴布什金两人，谢尔古诺夫后来眼睛瞎了，不能像以前一样积极地活动，巴布什金是热心的“火星派”（一九○○——一九○三年）和“布尔什维克”，因为参加一九○五年末或一九○六年初的西伯利亚起义而被枪毙了。
    这些传单是由社会民主主义团体、小组和组织印发的，从一八九五年末以来，这些团体、小组和组织大部分开始叫作“工人阶级解放斗争协会”。一八九八年，各地社会民主主义组织的代表大会创立了“俄国社会民主工党”。
    随着传单之后开始出现了不受检查的工人报纸，——例如，彼得堡一八九七年的《彼得堡工人报》③以及同一地方的《工人思想》报④，后者不久就迁移到国外去了。各地的社会民主主义报纸，从这个时候起几乎一直到革命为止，都是不受检查的，——自然，它们经常遭受破坏，但一次又一次地在全俄各地重新出现。
    当时的、即二十年前的工人传单和社会民主主义报纸，总括起来就是现在工人报刊直接的前驱：所刊登的同是那些对工厂的“揭发”，同是那些关于“经济”斗争的新闻，同是那些从马克思主义和彻底民主主义立场对工人运动任务的原则性的说明，——最后，同是工人报刊中的主要的两派，马克思主义派和机会主义派。
    直到现在还没有给以充分估计的这个特出的事实便是：俄国群众性的工人运动一旦产生（一八九五——一八九六年），立刻就有马克思主义派和机会主义派之分，这两派之分在形式、外貌等等方面是有变动的，但其实质则从一八九四年到一九一四年还是一样。显而易见，在社会民主党人内部斗争中，正是这两派之分而不是任何其他东西之分，有着深刻的社会的和阶级的根源。
    上述的“工人思想”就是代表当时的机会主义派，即所谓的“经济主义”。在各地工人运动活动家的论战中，这一派在一八九四——一八九五年就已经形成了。而在国外（俄国工人的觉醒从一八九六年起就引起了社会民主主义著作的盛行），“经济主义者”的出现和团结则结束于一九○○年春天的分裂（即是，这个分裂是在《火星报》产生以前，因为《火星报》第一期是在一九○○年末出版的）。
    一八九四——一九一四年这二十年工人报刊的历史，是俄罗斯马克思主义和俄罗斯（更正确些说：俄国）社会民主党的两派的历史。要理解俄国工人报刊的历史，就不仅要知道，而且甚至不一定要知道各种机关报刊的名称（这些名称什么也不能告诉现在的读者，而只能混乱他们的头脑），而是要知道社会民主党各个部分的内容、性质、思想路线。
    “经济主义者”的主要机关报是《工人思想》报（一八九七——一九○○年）和《工人事业》杂志⑤（一八九八——一九○一年）。《工人事业》杂志的领导者是克利切夫斯基（他以后投到工团主义者那边去了）、马尔丁诺夫（有名的孟什维克而现在是取消派分子）和阿基莫夫（现在是在一切重要方面都同意取消派分子的“独立社会民主党人”）。
    最先与经济主义者作斗争的只有普列汉诺夫和整个“劳动解放”社（《工作者》杂志以及其他等等），以后是《火星报》（从一九○○年到一九○三年八月，到召开社会民主工党第二次代表大会以前）。经济主义的实质是在什么地方呢？
    “经济主义者”在口头上特别努力地捍卫工人运动的群众性和工人的独立性，坚持“经济”鼓动有头等意义，坚持要缓和地或渐次地转到政治鼓动。读者可以看到：这还是取消派分子所炫耀的那一套心爱的空话。事实上，“经济主义者”所实行的是自由派的工人政策，这个政策的实质曾被当时的“经济主义”领袖之一，普罗科坡维奇简短地表现了出来：“经济——给工人，政治斗争——给自由派”。“经济主义者”对于工人独立性和群众运动比谁都闹得厉害，可是事实上他们是工人运动中机会主义的、小市民——知识分子的一翼。
    觉悟的工人在一九○一——一九○三年一百个政治犯中占了四十六个，而知识分子则占了三十七个；这些觉悟的工人绝大多数都站在旧《火星》报方面来反对机会主义。《火星报》三年（一九○一——一九○三年）的活动，制定了社会民主党的纲领、它的策略基础以及在彻底的马克思主义基础上把工人的经济斗争和政治斗争结合起来的形式。在《火星报》周围以及在它的思想领导下，工人报刊在革命前的年份中大规模地增长起来。不受检查的传单和不合法的印刷所是非常之多的，而且在俄国各地迅速地增加起来。
    《火星报》对“经济主义”的完全胜利，一九○三年无产阶级彻底的策略对知识分子机会主义的策略的完全胜利，引起了“同路人”汹涌流入社会民主党队伍里来，而机会主义则在《火星报》精神的基础上，作为它的一部分，以“孟什维主义”的形式复活起来。
    孟什维主义是在社会民主工党第二次代表大会（一九○三年八月）上由“火星派”少数分子（由此就有了孟什维主义这个称号）以及反对《火星报》的一切机会主义者所形成的。“孟什维克”返回到“经济主义”，当然是以稍微改变了的形式进行的；所有落在运动后面的“经济主义者”，以马尔丁诺夫为首，都加入了“孟什维克”的队伍。
    “孟什维主义”的主要机关报是新《火星报》，它是从一九○三年十一月起在新编辑部之下出版的：“旧《火星报》和新《火星报》之间横有一条鸿沟”——当时热心的孟什维克托洛茨基就率直地这样声明道。拥护彻底的马克思主义策略、忠实于旧《火星报》的布尔什维克的主要机关报是《前进报》⑥和《无产者报》⑦（一九○五年）。
    从与群众真正联系和表现无产阶级群众策略的这个观点看来，考验社会民主运动中和工人报刊中的主要两派，即孟什维克派和布尔什维克派的，是一九○五—一九○七年这些革命的年份。公开的社会民主主义报刊是不能在一九○五年秋天一下子产生的，如果与群众密切联系的先进工人的活动没有为这种报刊准备了基地的话。而如果一九○五年、一九○六年、一九○七年公开的社会民主主义报刊是两个倾向和两个派别的报刊，那末这只能是由于那个时代的工人运动中的小资产阶级路线和无产阶级路线是判然不同的。
    公开的工人报刊出现于三个高涨和比较“自由”的时期：一九○五年春天（布尔什维克的《新生活报》⑧，孟什维克的《创始报》⑨——在许多报刊中我们只指出主要的），一九○六年春天（布尔什维克的《浪潮报》⑩、《回声报》⑾等等，孟什维克的《人民杜马报》⑿等等），以及一九○七年春天。
    这个时代孟什维克策略的实质，马尔托夫自己最近就用下面的话表现出来了：
    “‘孟什维主义看不见无产阶级在现在的危机中’除了帮助资产阶级自由民主派实现它的打算，把有产阶级的反动部分排挤出国家政权而外，还有别的可能去作有效的参加，——但是这种帮助，无产阶级在保持着自己政治上的完全独立性的时候是应当实行的。”（路巴金：《在书丛中》，第二卷，第七七二页）
    这种“帮助”自由派的策略，事实上正是等于工人之依赖自由派，事实上正是自由派的工人政策。相反地，布尔什维主义的策略保障了工人阶级在资产阶级危机中的独立性，其方法是从事于使危机进行到底的斗争，是揭露自由主义的叛变，是教育和团结小资产阶级（特别是农村小资产阶级）来对抗这些叛变。
    大家知道，——而孟什维克自己直到现在的取消派分子科尔错夫、列维茨基等等也屡次地承认过，——在这些年份（一九○五——一九○七年）工人群众是跟着布尔什维克走的。布尔什维主义表现着运动的无产阶级实质，孟什维主义则表现着运动的机会主义的、小市民——知识分子的一翼。
    我们在这里不能详细地说明工人报刊中两派的策略之内容和意义。我们应当只限于精确地确定基本事实、决定历史发展的主要路线。
    俄国工人报刊差不多有一百年的历史——最先是准备阶段的历史，就是说，并非工人运动的历史，并非无产阶级运动的历史，而是“一般民主的”、即资产阶级民主的解放运动的历史，——然后是自身二十年的历史，是无产阶级、无产阶级民主主义或社会民主主义的历史。
    无论在什么地方，无产阶级运动不曾而且也不能“一下子”产生，带着纯粹的阶级面貌完整地出现于世界上，就像米涅尔瓦从朱彼忒⒀头中出来一样。只有凭着最先进的工人、一切自觉的工人的长期斗争和艰苦工作，无产阶级的阶级运动才能从各种各样的小资产阶级的混杂、限制、狭隘、歪曲中划分出来和巩固起来。工人阶级是与小资产阶级肩靠肩地生活着，而小资产阶级在破产中便把一批又一批的后备军送到无产阶级队伍里来。然而俄国是资本主义国家中最小资产阶级、最小市民的国家，这个国家现在才经历着资本主义革命时代，这种革命时代例如在英国是十七世纪，在法国是十八世纪及十九世纪前半期。
    觉悟的工人，在为自己血肉相关的事业——办理工人报刊，成立、巩固、发展工人报刊——而斗争的时候，是不会忘记俄国马克思主义和社会民主主义报刊二十年的历史的。
    给工人运动帮倒忙的就是工人运动的那些神经衰弱的知识分子朋友们，他们抹煞社会民主党的内部斗争，并且使半空中都充满着他们抹煞内部斗争的叫喊和呼吁。这是一些善良然而无用的人们，他们的叫喊也是无用的。
    只有研究了马克思主义与机会主义如何斗争的历史，只有切实而且详细地认识了独立的无产阶级民主派是怎样从小资产阶级的小市民中划分出来，先进的工人才能最后巩固自己的意识和自己的工人报刊。
