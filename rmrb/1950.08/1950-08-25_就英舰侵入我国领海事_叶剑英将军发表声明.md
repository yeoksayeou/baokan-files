　　General Ye Jianying Issues Statement Regarding British Warship Intrusion into Chinese Territorial Waters
　　The Hong Kong British authorities shall bear full responsibility for the consequences arising from the cross-border provocations by the Hong Kong British naval, land, and air forces.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 24th: General Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government and Commander of the Guangdong Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, today issued a statement regarding the intrusion of a British warship into Chinese territorial waters. The full text is as follows:
    I have received a report from our coastal defense forces stating: "On the morning of August 17th, a British warship, coming from the direction of Jiafeng Island in the Wanshan Islands, intruded into our territorial waters through the strait between our Outer Lingding and Dan'gan Islands. Our People's Liberation Army defense forces on the island immediately issued a warning. However, the British warship fired more than 20 shells at our troops, with shrapnel landing directly in our garrisoned defense area. After sailing back to Hong Kong waters, the ship continued to fire two more shells at our troops." I have received more than one report regarding this type of intrusion into our territorial waters by British warships. This provocative behavior by the British warship is inseparable from its imperialist foreign policy and is coordinated with the provocative behavior of the Hong Kong side's air force and army against our country.
    Prior to this incident, at 8:30 AM on August 2nd, four British aircraft intruded into the airspace over our Garbage Island for reconnaissance, circling once before flying southeast. From August 2nd to 6th, British aircraft continuously intruded into the airspace over our Wanshan Islands for reconnaissance for several consecutive days, with two to four aircraft each time.
    Even earlier, at 10:00 AM on July 6th, a British Air Force Spitfire aircraft intruded into the airspace over Shenzhen for several miles, circling for fifteen minutes before fleeing west. On the morning of July 27th at 10:00 AM, five fully armed British soldiers, carrying four rifles, one light machine gun, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, as well as compass binoculars and military maps of Shatoujiao, etc., were sent to the Shatoujiao border by a police officer from the Hong Kong Police Station. The five British soldiers penetrated two li into our border, as far as the Yuan Dun River bank, where they were discovered by us. After writing a letter of repentance, they were escorted out of the country.
    According to the above-mentioned circumstances, this series of incidents constitutes illegal acts by the Hong Kong British side's warships, aircraft, and British troops in crossing the border and infringing upon the territory, territorial waters, and airspace of our People's Republic of China. The Hong Kong British authorities have repeatedly disguised the truth of the above-mentioned incidents as "accidental" or "purely local incidents," and even distorted the facts and slandered our side.
    However, the facts cannot be denied. All of the above-mentioned incidents, without exception, occurred on the border of Guangdong Province and the territorial waters and airspace of all islands belonging to Guangdong. This alone is sufficient to constitute an intentional act of cross-border infringement by the Hong Kong British side.
    The various facts that have repeatedly occurred above fully prove that this series of cross-border provocations by the Hong Kong British authorities clearly belongs to a planned act of infringing upon our national sovereignty. Therefore, I hereby solemnly declare: the Hong Kong British authorities shall bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from the cross-border provocative actions of the Hong Kong British naval, land, and air forces.

　　就英舰侵入我国领海事
    叶剑英将军发表声明
    香港英方海陆空军的越境挑衅行为所引起的后果，  应由香港英方当局负担完全责任。
    【新华社广州二十四日电】广东省人民政府主席兼中国人民解放军广东军区司令员叶剑英将军本日就英舰侵入我国领海事发表声明，全文如下：
    兹接获我国海防部队报告：“八月十七日晨有英舰一艘，来自万山群岛之佳逢岛方面，经我外伶仃担捍岛间海峡突侵入我之领海范围。我岛上人民解放军防卫部队当即发出警告。讵该英舰竟向我军发炮二十余发，弹片直落入我驻守防地。该舰并于驶返港境后，又连续发炮二发向我军轰击。”本人接获关于英舰此种侵犯我国领海事件之报告，已不止一次。英舰的此种挑衅行为，和它的帝国主义对外政策，是分不开的；和港方的空军与陆军对我国的挑衅行为是互相配合的。
    在此事以前，在八月二日晨八时三十分，曾有英机四架侵入我国垃圾岛上空侦察，盘旋一周，向东南飞去。自八月二日至六日，一连数天英机不断侵入我国万山群岛领空侦察，每次均有二架至四架之多。
    较此更早，在七月六日上午十时，英空军喷火式飞机一架，即曾侵入我国深圳上空数英里，盘旋十五分钟之久，始向西逸去。七月二十七日上午十时，竟有全副武装之英军五名，带来福枪四枝，轻机枪一挺，弹药数百发，并带指南针双筒望远镜，及沙头角军用地图等，由港警署派警察一名，送至沙头角边界。该五名英军，即深入我边界二华里，远至元墩河河边，为我发觉，令写悔过书后，押送出境。
    依上所述情况，这一连串事件均系香港英方的军舰、飞机、及英军越界侵犯我中华人民共和国领土领海领空的非法行为。香港英方当局，并在上述事件发生后，曾屡次将事件之真相掩饰成为“偶然”或“纯地方性事件”，甚至歪曲事实，污蔑我方。
    但是，事实是不容抵赖的。所有上述这些事件，都毫无例外地发生于广东省边界及广东所属一切岛屿的领土领海和领空上。仅此一点，已足构成香港英方有意越境侵犯的行为。
    以上各种一再发生的事实，完全证明了香港英国当局这种一系列的越境挑衅行为，显然属于一种有计划地侵犯我国主权的行为。因此，我现就此事郑重声明：所有上述因香港英方海陆空军的越境挑衅行为所引起的一切后果，应由香港英方当局负担完全责任。
