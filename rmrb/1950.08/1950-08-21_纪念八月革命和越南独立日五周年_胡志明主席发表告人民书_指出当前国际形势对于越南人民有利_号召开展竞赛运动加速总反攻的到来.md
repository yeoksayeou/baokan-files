Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 19th: On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the August Revolution and Vietnam's Independence Day, President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a letter to the Vietnamese people, the full text of which is as follows:

Fellow countrymen and overseas compatriots, soldiers of the People's Army Armed Forces, cadres in government organs and people's organizations, young people and children:

Today we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the August Revolution and our independence.

Our patriotic war has been five years in the making. Let us examine the situation in these five years and set down the work to be done in the future.

Before the August Revolution, we faced two direct enemies—Japanese imperialists and French colonialists—and one indirect enemy—the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries. That is to say, our enemies were very strong at that time.

Before the August Revolution, we had neither political power nor a regular army, and the scale of our underground national united front was still small. That is to say, we were very weak at that time.

But because we took advantage of the international situation, united closely, and mobilized all our resources, we have turned weakness into strength, defeated three enemies, led our revolution to victory, and regained our independence.

But we had just regained our independence when the French aggressors launched a war against us. Their officers were well-supplied, heavily armed, and equipped with the latest weapons, planning to defeat us in a short period of time. Our armed forces were recently formed, and the weapons were very poor.

But subsequent events have proved that our strategy is superior to that of our enemies. Since the war was launched in Vietnam, more than a dozen French governments have collapsed, and French generals have been replaced six times. The French army has been weakened. France's financial situation is becoming increasingly difficult. At the same time, the movement demanding an end to the Vietnam War is booming among the French people. On our side, the prestige of the resistance government is growing day by day both at home and in the world. Our army is growing stronger day by day, and our people are more closely united and more determined to fight to the final victory.

Today, the French colonialists have had to openly admit that they have become too weak and powerless and that if the United States does not help them, they will not be able to continue the war of aggression in Vietnam.

But when the French colonialists begged the American imperialists for assistance, they were worried that the latter would drive them out and place the entire Vietnam under American rule, just as Japan had done years ago.

Since the beginning of the Vietnam War, American imperialism has been fully assisting the French colonialists. They are now going a step further to directly interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs. This means that in addition to our primary enemy—the French colonialists—we now have another enemy—the American interventionists.

The patriotic war of the past five years has brought us an unprecedented great victory in Vietnamese history: the world's two major powers—the Soviet Union, democratic China, and the people's democratic countries—have recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as an equal member of the democratic family. This means that we now stand in the democratic camp, in the anti-imperialist camp of about 800 million people.

These political victories will undoubtedly powerfully promote our people to win more military victories.

The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are growing stronger. The Chinese people have defeated American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Korean people have risen up to fight against the invading forces of the American interventionists and their vassals. These are the great allies of our people in the liberation war and in the struggle against the American interventionists.

The American reactionaries have been defeated by the combined forces and fighting determination of the Chinese people. They will also be defeated by the combined forces and will to fight for independence of the Vietnamese people, the Korean people, and the people of other countries in the world.

It is an undeniable fact that our long struggle will be victorious. However, there can be no victory without a long struggle. Therefore, the following urgent tasks are before our people.

Actively participate in the competition movement to implement the general mobilization order to accelerate the arrival of our general counter-offensive. Special attention must be paid to mobilizing manpower and material resources.

All soldiers of our National Defense Forces, local armies, and guerrillas must launch a competition to eliminate the enemy among themselves.

All our workers and peasants must launch a competition to increase production.

All our young people must take the lead in all activities such as joining the army, production, transporting materials, and carrying out learning movements.

All cadres in government organs and people's organizations must launch a competition to abide by the virtues of diligence, thrift, integrity, and honesty.

All our compatriots in enemy-occupied areas must launch a competition to prepare to attack the enemy and support our soldiers.

Dear compatriots, dear soldiers of the People's Armed Forces!

The August Revolution brought our country independence and unity, bringing us victory. At that time, our strength was still insufficient, although our will to strive for national unity was very strong. Our long-term resistance has enabled us to safeguard our independence and unity. We will certainly be able to win the final victory, because we have now become stronger than before, and because the domestic and international situations are now favorable to us.

However, we must remember that the enemy will become more barbaric, more cruel, and they may try to expand their occupied areas before they are destroyed by our forces. Before we win complete victory, we will suffer greater hardships and poverty than ever before. Therefore, we must remain calm, steadfast in our will, we must not be discouraged by temporary setbacks, nor be overly proud of our victories, and we must neither be complacent nor underestimate our own achievements.

Because our government and people are united as one, because our army and people are of one mind, because all our people are closely united and have an indomitable will, and because we have the support of all the democratic and peace-loving people in the world, our long-term resistance must be victorious.

    【新华社二十日讯】越南通讯社北越十九日讯：越南民主共和国胡志明主席于八月革命和越南独立日五周年纪念日之际，发表告越南人民书，全文如下：
    全国同胞们和海外侨胞们，人民军武装部队战士们，政府机关和人民团体中的干部们，青年儿童们：
    我们今天庆祝八月革命和我们的独立的五周年纪念日。
    我们的爱国战争已有五年的历史了。让我们来考察一下这五年中的情况并订下来日要做的工作吧。
    在八月革命以前，我们面临着两个直接的敌人——日本帝国主义者和法国殖民主义者，和一个间接的敌人——中国国民党反动派。那就是说，当时我们的敌人很强。
    在八月革命以前，我们既没有政权，又没有正规军，而我们的地下民族统一阵线的规模仍然很小。那就是说，当时我们很弱。
    但是由于我们利用国际形势，紧密团结起来，并动员我们所有的资源，我们已经转弱为强，已经打败三个敌人，使我们的革命走向胜利，并重获独立。
    但我们刚刚重获独立，法国侵略者就向我们发动战争。他们军官充分、武装强大并装备有最新式武器，计划在短时期内把我们击败。我们的武装部队是最近组成的，武器很差。
    但以后的事件证明，我们的战略优于我们敌人的战略。自从在越南发动战争后，十多个法国政府垮台了，法国的将领撤换过六次。法国军队业已削弱。法国的财政情况日益困难。同时，要求停止越南战争的运动则在法国人民中间蓬勃展开。在我们方面，抗战政府在国内及世界上的声望与日俱增。我们的军队一天天壮大起来，我们的人民更加密切地团结起来，更加决心战到获得最后胜利为止。
    今天，法国殖民者已不得不公开承认，他们已变得太孱弱无力了，如果美国不援助他们，他们就不能把在越南的侵略战争继续下去。
    但当法国殖民者向美国帝国主义者乞求援助的时候，他们又担心后者把他们赶出去，把整个越南置于美国的统治之下，就像数年前日本所做的那样。
    自越南战争开始后，美国帝国主义一直在全力援助法国殖民者。他们现在更进一步直接干涉越南的内政。这就是说：除了我们的首敌——法国殖民者——外，我们现在又有另一个敌人——美国干涉者。
    过去五年的爱国战争给我们带来越南历史上空前伟大的胜利：世界两大强国——苏联、民主的中国以及人民民主国家，承认了越南民主共和国作为民主国家大家庭中平等的一员。这就是说，我们现在站在民主阵营中，站在约八亿人民的反帝国主义阵营中。
    这些政治胜利无疑将有力地推动我们人民赢取更多的军事胜利。
    苏联和各人民民主国家在日益壮大中。中国人民已打败美帝国主义和国民党反动派。朝鲜人民已经起来与美国干涉者及其附庸国的进犯军作战。这些是我国人民在解放战争中和反对美国干涉者的斗争中的伟大同盟军。
    美国反动派已经被中国人民的联合力量和战斗决心打败。他们同样地也将被越南人民、朝鲜人民、以及世界上其他各国人民的联合力量及为独立而斗争的意志打败。
    我们长期的奋斗一定会获得胜利，这是一件不可否认的事实。但是，没有长期奋斗，也就不可能得到胜利。因此，在我国人民面前就有下列紧急任务。
    积极参加执行总动员令的竞赛运动，以加速我们的总反攻的到来。必须特别注意动员人力和粮物资源。
    我们的国防军、地方军和游击队的全体战士们，必须在他们之间展开消灭敌人的竞赛。
    我们的全体工人和农民们，必须展开增加生产的竞赛。
    我们所有的青年们必须在参军、生产、运输物资、开展学习运动等一切活动中起带头作用。
    政府机关和人民团体中的全体干部们，必须展开遵守勤勉、节俭、忠诚和正直等美德的竞赛。
    敌占区的全体同胞们必须展开准备进攻敌人、支援我们战士的竞赛。
    亲爱的同胞们，亲爱的人民武装部队的战士们！
    八月革命使我们国家重获独立与统一，带给我们胜利。在那时候，我们的力量还不足，虽然我们争取国家统一的意志是很强的。我们的长期抵抗已使我们能够保障我们的独立与团结，我们一定能够赢得最后胜利，因为我们现在已比以前变得更加强大，并且因为国内和国际形势，现在都对我们有利。
    可是，我们必须记住：敌人将会变得更加野蛮，更加残忍，并且在被我们的力量消灭他们之前，他们可能试图扩大他们的占领区。在我们赢得完全胜利之前，我们将会遭受到比以往更大的艰苦与穷困。因此，我们必须保持头脑冷静、意志坚定，我们必须不因一时的挫折而沮丧，不因我们的胜利而过分骄傲，既不要自满，也不要低估我们自己的成绩。
    由于我们的政府与人民团结一致，由于我们的军队与人民万众一心，由于我们全体人民亲密团结并具有不屈不挠的意志，由于我们得到全世界民主与爱好和平的人民的支持，我们的长期抵抗一定要获得胜利。
