The Municipal Consultative Committee, based on the resolution of the Second Session of the Second Municipal People's Representative Conference, drafted the "General Rules for the Organization of District People's Representative Conferences in Beijing," which was approved by the Fifth Session of the Municipal Consultative Committee and the Municipal People's Government Committee and promulgated on May 16 after being submitted to and approved by the Government Administration Council. At present, the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts have successively convened district people's representative conferences, and the results of the trial implementation have been very good. Other districts are also carrying out preparatory work and will convene conferences one after another if the General Assembly agrees.

The Sixth District convened its first District People's Representative Conference on May 31, with 171 representatives; the Seventh District convened its conference on June 6, with 143 representatives; the First District convened its conference on June 28, with 182 representatives; and the Fifth District convened its conference on July 15, with 168 representatives. The conferences lasted from three and a half days to two and a half days. The number of representatives was determined by the preparatory committees in consultation with the Municipal People's Government, based on the distribution of residents in each district.

Before convening the conferences, each district government invited people from all walks of life to form a preparatory committee, which was responsible for the preparatory work related to the convening of the district people's representative conference and the election of representatives. The quality of this preparatory work has a great impact on the work of the district people's representative conference itself.

The district people's representative conferences collected many proposals and opinions. The Sixth District had 1,272 items, the Seventh District had 1,492 items, the First District had 2,746 items, and the Fifth District had 800 items. Some of these proposals and opinions were directly put forward by the representatives, some were collected through symposiums or visits to residents before the conference or during the election process, some were submitted in writing by residents, and some were verbally expressed and recorded by the preparatory committee. In other words, we did not adhere to any mechanically prescribed form but adopted various methods to facilitate the people's expression of opinions. From the perspective of form, this approach may seem irregular, but from the perspective of the content of the proposals and opinions, it truly reflects the urgent demands and real opinions of the people in each district.

The content of the proposals received by the districts mainly concerned residents' welfare issues, especially public health and urban construction, followed by criticisms and opinions on government staff. The vast majority of them were related to the vital interests of the people. Some districts even had more than 2,700 proposals. This ironclad fact proves that it is absolutely necessary to convene district people's representative conferences.

During the conferences, the representatives were very enthusiastic. They listened to the work reports of the district governments, understood that the government had done many things for the people, and also recognized that the current government is indeed the people's own government. They also handled all the proposals and opinions at the conferences, realizing Chairman Mao's instruction that "all opinions can be expressed, and all proposals can be submitted for deliberation." Many representatives had never participated in such political life before. They now participated in such a people's representative conference in the capacity of people's representatives, making them feel that "this is unprecedented." In particular, the criticism and examination of the work style of government staff made the representatives very excited and enthusiastic in their speeches. They raised many criticisms of the government staff and also expressed great concern and care for them.

After the conferences, the representatives generally believed that the conferences were well-conducted, "truly democratic," and able to solve problems. At first, they felt very constrained, and some even said, "I don't know how to stand when I get to the meeting place." After the conferences, some said, "I participated in this conference and realized what a representative conference is all about. From now on, I will no longer wait and see what the government leaders do." Others said, "In the past, I didn't think the district representative conference was so important. I didn't expect this conference to solve so many problems. I didn't want to speak, but I was very happy to see such democracy, so I spoke."

From the results and reactions of this conference, in a large city like Beijing, with 100,000 to 200,000 people in a district, and so many demands and opinions raised by the people at the district representative conference, it is very necessary to hold such a conference. This can not only better concentrate the people's opinions and strengthen the ties between the government and the people, enabling the people to assist the government in its work, making the government's policies and plans easier to implement, but also enabling the government and cadres to be supervised and criticized by the people, thus quickly overcoming many shortcomings in the work and improving work efficiency. This not only strengthens the cadres' view of being responsible to the people and serving the people, giving a great blow to bureaucracy and commandism, but also makes it easier for the people to quickly raise their awareness as masters of the country from the experience of actual democratic life.

Naturally, the district people's representative conference is only beginning to be established in Beijing. Cadres and the masses do not have enough experience with such conferences, so there are still many shortcomings. However, the results of the trial implementation in several districts are enough to prove that district people's representative conferences should be universally promoted throughout the city.

What experience have we gained from the representative conferences in these four districts? Now, for the sake of convenience, we put forward our opinions from a positive perspective.

First, when convening district people's representative conferences, everything, including publicity, elections, and meetings, should be based on the principle of convenience for the masses and avoiding wasting their time. We must fully estimate that the people's time is precious and must minimize the delay in their work and study time. Of course, before the conference, we should explain to the people as much as possible why the district people's representative conference is being convened, how the representatives should be elected, how the conference should be held, and what problems should be solved, so that the people actively participate and submit the problems they want to solve to the representative conference. However, do not attempt to hold one meeting after another, using methods such as "explaining door to door" and "visiting households one by one" to achieve "universal knowledge" before the masses have never held a district representative conference and have no practical experience, causing the masses to be overwhelmed. Some districts have made this mistake this time.

Second, simple methods should be adopted in electing representatives, without extravagance or pursuit of form. From the experience of several districts, under the current circumstances, regarding the election methods of representatives, in addition to the representatives of organizations, institutions, and parties being selected by their respective units, the election of other resident representatives is currently impossible to implement too early on the basis of individual citizens through universal suffrage. Generally, it can only be recommended on the basis of household registration. At present, this is the only way to make it work, and there is nothing wrong with doing so. In fact, there is no great difference in the interests of family members within a household on the issues to be resolved by the district representative conference at present. It is possible to generally represent their opinions by generating representatives on a household basis.

Third, it is a good phenomenon that there are so many proposals in the conference. This not only shows the people's urgent need for the district representative conference, but also shows the people's political enthusiasm. The government must seriously handle these proposals separately. All those that the district has the right to decide and can handle should be seriously handled (the Seventh District can handle about 45 percent of the total number of proposals). All those that the district cannot decide or handle on its own should be reported to the Municipal People's Government for resolution. Those that cannot be handled should be clearly explained to the representatives, stating the reasons why they cannot be handled.

Fourth, problems should be solved with emphasis. In the representative conferences that have already been held in several districts, the masses have been led in a planned and focused manner to concentrate their efforts on solving certain welfare problems and reviewing the work style of cadres. Naturally, there are still many problems that the masses want to solve and should solve, but this can only be gradually solved according to our subjective strength and the urgency and importance of the problems. It is impossible to solve all the problems at one conference.

Fifth, inspecting the work style of cadres is an important task of this district representative conference. By adopting methods of criticism and self-criticism through the district representative conference, mobilizing the masses, inspecting the work style of government staff, as well as the corruption of individual elements, and overcoming the shortcomings and errors in our government, we can greatly improve our work and maintain a more direct and closer consolidated relationship between the people and their own government. Some representatives in some districts said after the meeting: "Now we can manage if government cadres make mistakes." "The government is really our own." Some representatives were deeply moved after listening to the self-criticism of the district head and believed that: "This is something that has never been seen before." This all shows that using democratic methods to carry out criticism and self-criticism is a good method for the people to conduct self-education.

Sixth, it is very necessary to establish a consultative committee of the district people's representative conference and make the consultative committee a standing organization for contacting the people. After the conferences in some districts, the masses went to the consultative committee to discuss matters when they had something to do. This shows that such an organization is very suitable for the people's needs. Therefore, not only should a district consultative committee be established, with fixed personnel responsible for daily work, but also various specialized committees should be established under the consultative committee, such as cleaning and hygiene, repairing houses, etc., so as to constantly contact the masses and carry out various tasks.

This is the report of the Consultative Committee on the progress and experience summary of the district people's representative conferences. Please discuss and make a final decision at the General Assembly.

　　京各界代表会协商委会钱端升副主席
    关于召开区各界人民代表会议的报告
    关于区各界人民代表会议的召开问题，市协商委员会根据第二届第二次各界人民代表会议的决议，拟定了“北京市区各界人民代表会议组织通则”，经本届第五次市协商委员会与市人民政府委员会通过，报请政务院批准后，已于五月十六日公布施行。现在，一、五、六、七等区已经先后召开了区各界人民代表会议，试行结果，成绩很好。其他各区也正在进行筹备工作，如果大会同意的话，即将陆续召开。
    第六区在五月三十一日召开第一次区各界人民代表会议，代表一七一名；第七区在六月六日召开会议，代表一四三名；第一区在六月二十八日召开会议，代表一八二名；第五区在七月十五日召开会议，代表一六八名。会议时间多的是三天半，少的是两天半。代表名额是根据各区居民分布的特点，由筹备委员会协商后，报请市人民政府决定的。
    各区在召开会议前，都由区政府邀集各界人士成立了筹备委员会，负责进行有关区各界人民代表会议的召集和代表选举等项筹备工作。这些筹备工作的好坏，对于区各界人民代表会议本身的工作进行，是有很大影响的。
    这次各区人民代表会议所收集的提案和意见，是很多的，第六区有一、二七二条，第七区有一、四九二条，第一区有二、七四六条，第五区有八○○条。这些提案和意见，有些是由代表直接提出来的，有些是在会议前或在选举过程中经过座谈会或访问居民的形式收集起来的，有的是居民用书面交来的，有的是由他们口头提出由筹委会记录下来的，就是说我们没有拘泥于任何机械规定的形式，而是采取了各种便于人民表达意见的方式集中起来的。从形式上看来，这种作法，好像很不正规，但从提案和意见的内容来看，它却真正地集中了各区人民的切身要求和真实意见。
    这次各区所收到的提案的内容，主要的是关于居民福利问题，特别是公共卫生、市政建设等，其次是对于政府工作人员的批评和意见，绝大多数是与人民的切身利害有关的。有的区提案竟达两千七百余件之多，这一铁的事实证明，召开区各界人民代表会议是十分必要的。
    在会议进行中，代表们的情绪是很热烈的。他们在会议中听取了区政府的工作报告，了解了政府替人民办了许多事情，同时也认识到现在的政府，的确是人民自己的政府。他们又在会议中处理了所有的提案和意见，实现了毛主席所说的“凡有意见都可发表，凡有提案都可付审议”的指示。有许多代表从来没有参加过这样的政治生活，他们现在以人民代表的身份来参加了这样名实相符的人民代表会议，使他们感觉到“这是开天辟地以来所没有的”，特别是对于政府工作人员作风的批评与检查，更使代表们十分兴奋，发言热烈，他们对政府工作人员提了很多批评，同时也对他们表示了很大的关切与爱护。
    会议之后，代表们一般认为会议开得好，“真是民主”，能解决问题。开始他们很感拘束，甚至有人说：“到了会场里不晓得怎么站。”经过会议之后，有人说：“我参加了这个会，才知道代表会议是怎么一回事，往后对政府领导办的事，再也不观望了。”也有人说：“过去我没有把区代表会看得怎么重要，没有想到这次会解决这么多问题，本来我不想说话，但我看到这样民主，很高兴，也就说话了。”
    从这个会议所产生的结果和所得到的反应来看，在北京这样的大城市，一个区有一、二十万人口，人民在区代表会议上提的要求和意见这样多，开这样的会议是很有必要的。这样不仅可以更多地集中人民的意见，更密切政府和人民的联系，使人民来协助政府办事，因而使政府的方针和计划更容易贯彻，并且使政府和干部得到人民的监督与批评，因而迅速克服了很多工作中的缺点，提高了工作的效能。这样不仅加强了干部对人民负责、为人民服务的观点，给官僚主义和命令主义以很大打击。同时，也更易使人民从实际的民主生活体验中迅速提高主人翁的自觉。
    自然，区各界人民代表会议在北京还只是开始建立，干部和群众对这样的会议，还没有足够的经验，因此还有许多缺点。但是在几个区试行的结果，足以证明：区各界人民代表会议是应该在全市普遍推行的。
    从这四个区的代表会议中，我们得到一些什么经验呢？现在为了说明上的简便，从正面提出我们的意见。
    第一、在召开区各界人民代表会议时，无论宣传、选举、开会，一切都应以便利群众和不多浪费群众的时间为原则。必须充分估计到群众的时间是宝贵的，必须尽量少耽误他们的工作和学习时间。自然，在会议前，应根据区代表会议的组织通则和政府准备在代表会议中解决的中心问题，尽可能向人民说明为什么要召开区人民代表会议，代表要怎样选举，会要怎样开，要解决些什么问题，使人民积极参加并向代表会议提出他们要解决的问题，但是切不要企图在群众从未开过区代表会议毫无实际体验之前，左一个会，右一个会，用“沿门解释”、“挨户走访”的方式，做到“家喻户晓”之后，再来选举，再来开会，致使群众不胜其烦，我们这次有个别区就犯了这种毛病。
    第二、在选举代表时要采取简便的办法，不要铺张，不要追求形式。从几个区的经验来看，在目前的情况下，关于代表的选举方法，除团体和机关、党派代表由各单位自行选派外，其他居民代表的选举，目前决不可能过早的按照公民个人为基础，来实行普选，一般的还只能按户口为基础来推选。现在，只有这样才能行得通，同时这样办也并没有坏处。事实上一户之内的家庭成员间在区代表会议目前所要解决的问题上，没有什么很大的不同利害关系，以户为单位来产生代表，是可以大体代表他们的意见的。
    第三、在会议中的提案这样多，是一种很好的现象，这不仅表示了人民对于区代表会议的迫切需要，而且表现了人民的政治的积极性，政府对于这些提案，必须认真的分别加以处理。凡是区有权决定和能够办的应该认真办理（七区能办的约占提案总数百分之四十五）。凡是区自己不能决定不能办理的应该报请市人民政府解决。不能办的，应向代表解释清楚，说明不能办的理由。
    第四、应该有重点地解决问题。在已开的几个区的代表会议，都是有计划、有重点地领导群众集中力量解决若干福利问题及对干部作风进行检讨。自然群众要求解决和应当解决的问题还很多，但这只能按照我们的主观力量和问题的缓急轻重来逐渐解决。决不可能在一次会上把所有问题都解决。
    第五、检查干部作风是这次区代表会议一项重要的任务，通过区代表会议，采取批评和自我批评的方法，发动群众，检查政府工作人员作风，以及个别分子的贪污、腐化，克服我们政府中的缺点和错误，就能大大改进我们的工作，使人民和自己的政府保持更直接、更密切的巩固的联系。有些区的代表在会后说：“现在政府干部有了错，我们可以管了。”“政府真是我们自己的。”有些代表在听取了区长的自我批评以后深受感动，认为：“这是一件从来没有看到过的事情。”这都说明用民主的方法来进行批评与自我批评，是人民内部进行自我教育的良好方法。
    第六、成立区各界人民代表会议的协商委员会，并使协商委员会成为经常联系人民的机构，是很必要的。有些区在开过会以后，群众有了事就找协商委员会来商量。这说明这样的组织是很适合人民的要求的。因此，不仅要设立区协商委员会的机构，有固定的人负担日常工作，并且要在协商委员会之下设立各种专门委员会，如清洁卫生、修缮房屋……等等，以便经常联系群众，进行各种工作。
    这就是协商委员会关于区人民代表会进行情形和经验总结的报告。请大会讨论并作最后决定。
