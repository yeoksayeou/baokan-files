Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 31st: Four old companies of the People's Liberation Army Third Field Army, dating back to the Red Army era, wrote letters to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the eve of the August 1st Army Day to pay their respects. In their letters, they unanimously thanked Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu for their wise leadership over the past twenty years and resolutely expressed their determination to actively train troops and prepare to liberate Taiwan. These four companies are: the "People's Meritorious Service First Company" of a certain army, which was originally a company of the Fujian Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Independent Division in 1928; the First Company of the "Luoyang Battalion" of a certain army, which was originally composed of peasants from the Pingjiang Uprising in Hunan in 1927; the "Red First Company" of a certain army, which was originally the guard company of Commander-in-Chief Zhu during the Jinggangshan era in 1927; and the Fourth Company of a certain howitzer regiment of the Special Forces Column, which was one of the three artillery companies formed by combining all artillery units after the Red Army's Long March.

　　The commanders and fighters of each company excitedly recalled their glorious achievements in their letters and reported on their current situation. The First Company of the "Luoyang Battalion" reported: "Since the Pingjiang Peasant Uprising in 1927, our company has experienced more than 600 battles. Now our entire company has 104 Communist Party members, two combat heroes, fourteen combat models, work models, and 120 people's meritorious service members." The commanders and fighters of each company cherish the glorious history of their company very much. The letter from the "Red First Company" wrote: "Whenever we encounter difficulties or suffer hardships, the comrades think of the army that you personally cultivated and led, and we recall the scenes of the old comrades climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands in those years. Therefore, a boundless force encourages us."

　　The letters unanimously expressed their determination to defeat the aggression of American imperialism and liberate Taiwan. The commanders and fighters of the Fourth Company of a certain howitzer regiment, who armed themselves with American-made 105mm howitzers seized from the Chiang bandits, wrote in their letters with excitement: "We stand in front of the cannons and swear: We will resolutely maintain and carry forward the fine traditions and fighting style of the old Red Army artillery company, not fear any hardship or sacrifice, and wait for your orders at any time, pointing the muzzle directly at Taiwan and bombarding the enemy with even greater precision and force than before. If American imperialism dares to obstruct us, we will defeat it with a hundred times more courage!"

　　The other letters also reported on their hard study and hard training, learning science and technology, preparing to liberate Taiwan and establish a national defense army. The entire body of commanders and fighters of the "Red First Company" reported on their troop training situation, saying: "Mutual aid groups among platoons, squads and individuals throughout our company have enthusiastically launched training challenges and competitions, and plans have been made to inspect them once a week. The original schedule was to get up at 5 o'clock, but the comrades got up at 4 o'clock, and they always went to bed a little later at night. Once, during a land exercise, thirteen of our comrades had their legs cut by barbed wire, but they bandaged their wounds and continued to participate in the exercise until it ended. When practicing swimming at sea, our skin was broken and our faces were scorched by the hot summer sun, but no one complained of pain. Everyone said: This kind of hard training is to improve our skills and prepare to liberate Taiwan."

　　The commanders and fighters of each company assured Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu that they would never be arrogant or complacent, but would study even more humbly to maintain the glorious history and excellent qualities of the old Red Army company, people's heroes, and people's meritorious service members, and resolutely defend the motherland and consolidate national defense. They wrote in their letters: "All glory and achievement are the result of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation and education. All glory belongs to the people, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao. Being a soldier of Mao Zedong and a soldier of the National Defense Army of the People's Republic of China is our greatest glory."

　　三野四个工农红军时代的老连队
    致函毛主席朱总司令祝贺“八一”
    决心积极练兵击退美国侵略解放台湾
    【新华社南京三十一日电】人民解放军第三野战军中四个工农红军时代的老连队，在八一建军节前夕，分别写信给毛主席和朱总司令致敬。信中一致感谢毛主席和朱总司令二十多年来的英明领导，并向他们坚决表示积极练兵、准备解放台湾的决心。这四个连队是：某军的“人民功臣第一连”，它原是一九二八年福建工农红军独立师的一个连；某军的“洛阳营”第一连，原系一九二七年湖南平江起义农民所组成：某军的“红一连”，原系一九二七年朱总司令在井冈山时代的警卫连；特种纵队某榴炮团第四连，系红军长征以后全部炮兵合编而成的三个炮兵连之一。
    各连指战员们在信中兴奋地回忆了他们的光荣战绩，并报告了他们现在的情况。“洛阳营”第一连报告说：“我们连队自一九二七年平江农民起义以来，共经战斗六百余次。现在俺们全连有一百零四名共产党员，两名战斗英雄，十四名战斗模范、工作模范和一百二十名人民功臣。”各连指战员们非常珍惜他们连队的光荣历史。“红一连”的信中写道：“当每次遇到困难或受苦、受累时，同志们就想到我连曾是您们亲自培养率领的军队，就想起老同志们当年爬雪山、过草地的情景。因此，就有一种无比的力量鼓舞着我们。”
    信中一致地表示了他们打败美帝国主义的侵略和解放台湾的决心。用夺自蒋匪的美国制造的一○五公厘榴弹炮武装了自己的某榴炮团第四连的指战员们在信中激昂地写着：“我们站在炮前宣誓：坚决保持和发扬老红军炮兵连的优良传统和战斗作风，不怕一切艰苦、牺牲，随时等待着你们的命令，将炮口直指台湾，比以往还要精确、沉重的轰击敌人。假如美帝国主义敢来阻挡，我们就百倍勇敢地打败它！”
    其他信中也报告了他们苦学、苦练，学习科学技术、准备解放台湾和建立国防军的情形。“红一连”全体指战员报告他们的练兵情况说：“我们全连班排互助组及个人之间，都已热烈地展开了练兵的挑战竞赛，并订出计划，每周检查一次。原规定五点钟起床，同志们在四点钟就起床了，而晚间又总是迟睡一点。有一次，在陆上演习中，我们有十三个同志曾被铁丝网划破了腿，他们把伤口包扎以后，继续参加演习，直到结束。在海上练习游泳时，我们被夏天炎热的太阳晒破了皮，晒焦了脸，而无一叫痛，大家都说：我们这种苦练，是为了提高本领，准备解放台湾。”
    各连指战员都向毛主席、朱总司令保证决不骄傲自满，更要虚心学习，以保持老红军连队、人民英雄、人民功臣的光荣历史和优良品质，坚决捍卫祖国，巩固国防。他们在信中写道：“一切光荣和成就都是共产党和毛主席培养、教育的结果。一切光荣归于人民、共产党和毛主席。作为一个毛泽东的战士、中华人民共和国的国防军战士，就是我们的最大光荣。”
