　　Teachers, Staff and Students of Normal University
    Protest Against the Shameless Atrocities of the United States
    [Report from this newspaper] The American imperialists' frantic and barbaric act of reconnaissance over our airspace and strafing of our people has aroused the anger and hatred of the teachers, staff, and students of Normal University. On the morning of the 28th, when the students of the Second Academy of Normal University were having breakfast, after hearing the news from the loudspeaker that "American imperialist aircraft invaded our airspace and strafed our people," all the students unanimously condemned the American imperialists' atrocities and declared their willingness to support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement with practical actions.
    Professor Sheng Xugong of the Department of Geography angrily expressed his opinion: "This atrocity is not an unintentional mistake by an individual of the American Air Force, but a planned and tentative provocation by American imperialism. The fate of history has determined the death of American imperialism; the only question is the time."
    In addition, the Great Dictionary Compilation Office and the Drama Group of the Literary Committee of Normal University also raised protests. The Normal University Trade Union and the Student Union also jointly issued a statement on the afternoon of the same day, protesting the shameless behavior of American imperialism and resolutely supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.

　　师大教职员工同学
    抗议美国无耻暴行
    【本报讯】美帝疯狂而野蛮地向我领空侦察并扫射我国人民的暴行，引起了师范大学的教职员工及同学们的愤怒与憎恨。二十八日晨师大二院同学们在吃早点时，从播音筒中听到“美帝飞机侵入我国领空，扫射我国人民。”的消息后，全体同学一致斥责美帝暴行，并声明愿以实际行动拥护周外长声明。
    地理系教授盛叙功先生气愤地发表了意见：“这一暴行，不是美空军个人的无意错误，而是美帝有计划的试探性的挑衅。历史的命运已决定美帝的死亡，问题只是时间的早晚。”
    此外，师大的大辞典编纂处、文委会戏剧组等单位，都提出了抗议。师大工会、学生会也于当日下午，联合发表声明，抗议美帝的无耻行为，坚决拥护周外长的声明。（师大通讯组）
