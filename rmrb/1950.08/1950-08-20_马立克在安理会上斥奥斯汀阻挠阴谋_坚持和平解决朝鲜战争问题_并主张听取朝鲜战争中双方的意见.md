Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 18th: TASS, New York, August 18th: The Security Council held a regular meeting on the 17th, presided over by Malik. After announcing the opening of the meeting, Malik declared that the Security Council members had held a closed meeting immediately prior to this public meeting to exchange views on the issues raised at the previous meeting. Malik pointed out that the participants in the closed meeting believed it best to continue the exchange of views.

Malik then invited the first speaker, Cuban representative Álvarez, to speak. Álvarez imitated the arguments previously made by U.S. Representative Austin and British Representative Jebb. He made accusations because representatives of the Syngman Rhee group were not invited to attend the Security Council meetings. His speech was filled with countless slanders against the Soviet Union, and Álvarez concluded his speech by criticizing the Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The next speaker was U.S. Representative Austin. Austin delivered a lengthy speech, explaining what, from the U.S. point of view, would be a "satisfactory" solution to the Korean issue for the imperialists. He admitted that what he was pursuing was essentially the subordination of North and South Korea to the United States.

Austin began his speech by endorsing Álvarez's attack on Malik's chairmanship of the Security Council, insisting that Malik was obstructing the "regular procedures" of the Security Council. Austin hypocritically claimed that the United States only desired peace, saying that the United States was determined to uphold the purposes of the United Nations and had no intention of using Korea as a military base. Austin advocated that the United Nations establish a commission to go to the war zone to assist in establishing order and transforming the war into a "sound peace." Austin made a series of rude slanders attacking the Soviet representative and the Soviet Union, accusing the Soviet Union of lacking the desire to promote the unity of the United Nations. Austin attempted to shift the responsibility for the Korean War onto the Soviet Union. Austin tried to evade the U.S.'s responsibility for aggression against Korea, saying that if the Soviet Union was now willing to exert its influence, the disruption of peace in Korea would end forever.

Following him was Kuomintang representative Chiang Ting-fu, who obsequiously tried to defend the U.S.-British bloc and opposed the Soviet Union's condemnation of imperialist aggression in Asia. Chiang Ting-fu said many vile and hostile things against the Soviet Union in his speech. After he finished, Yugoslav representative Bebler spoke, saying he welcomed India's initiative.

The next speaker, Norwegian representative Sunde, again raised the procedural issue of Syngman Rhee's representative attending the Security Council meeting; he put forward lengthy legalistic arguments to explain the "reasonableness" of the U.S.-British bloc's position, which wanted Syngman Rhee's representative to attend but refused to listen to the opinions of the Korean people's representatives.

Malik then delivered a speech in his capacity as the Soviet representative. He responded to Austin's arguments and reserved the right to reply later if the Soviet delegation deemed it necessary.

Malik pointed out that he had tried his best to find something new in Austin's speech, but found nothing. Although there were some new words in Austin's speech, the substance remained unchanged. Austin avoided discussing the basic fact of American aggression against the Korean people; Austin did not answer the facts and arguments raised by the Soviet delegation. Malik pointed out that Austin was attempting to divert the attention of world public opinion and the Security Council from the actual situation in Korea. Malik said that due to the barbaric bombing by the United States, the Korean people were bleeding, women, children, and the elderly were being massacred, and people's property was being destroyed. Thousands of American soldiers were dying there; the American press reported that thousands upon thousands of people were dying there, not knowing why they were fighting or why they were dying. Malik said that Austin avoided answering these questions and instead spoke vaguely about future prospects.

Malik continued, "The Security Council is facing the issue of a peaceful resolution to the Korean War, and this issue must be resolved. However, the United States does not want to resolve this issue. The U.S. delegation is obstructing the Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. With the support of Marshallized countries (which are under pressure), the United States is obstructing the Soviet Union's proposal. The United States is preventing both sides in the Korean War from being heard. Malik asked: How can there be any talk of a peaceful resolution without listening to the opinions of the two government camps involved in the war on both sides? Any objective and sensible person would definitely come to the conclusion that both sides should be heard. According to common sense and the provisions of the United Nations Charter, this is perfectly clear. But the United States opposes doing so. The United States proposes aggressive proposals to expand the war, threatening to send more troops to Korea and more people to their deaths, simply because the ruling groups in the United States want it that way. In order to cover up its aggressive intentions, the U.S. representative once again talked about the influence of the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union will never exert its influence in the way the United States does, in the way Acheson exerted influence on Syngman Rhee during the May elections."

Malik recounted that the Soviet delegation had announced its willingness to participate in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the Security Council. However, the U.S. government and its delegation are undermining the Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue and obstructing the passage of the Soviet Union's legitimate proposal to hear the opinions of both sides. Therefore, the U.S. delegation is obstructing the Security Council from considering a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. Malik continued, "The Soviet Union is prepared to actively participate in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue through the Security Council. But the United States does not want to do so, because it is gambling on expanding the war rather than on a peaceful resolution."

Malik then spoke of Austin's statement that the Security Council contained great wisdom, saying that the Security Council could and would become such an institution if the American rulers had not attempted to turn the Security Council into a den of power and manipulation, if the American rulers had not attempted to turn the Security Council into a tool of the American ruling group's aggressive policies.

Malik spoke of the United Nations Charter which stipulates that the Security Council is the primary body for maintaining international peace. He called on the Security Council to fulfill its sacred obligation to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. However, Malik reiterated that such a proposal had been met with opposition from the United States and its vassal states.

In response to Sunde's argument that the North Korean authorities did not want to have anything to do with the Security Council, Malik pointed out that this statement was not in accordance with the facts. Malik recounted that it could be seen from the records of the United Nations organization that the U.S.-British bloc had prevented representatives from North Korea from attending when the United Nations General Assembly considered the Korean issue. At present, the U.S.-British bloc is implementing the same steps in the Security Council.

After Malik's speech, the Security Council adjourned and will reconvene on August 22.

### 马立克在安理会上斥奥斯汀阻挠阴谋  坚持和平解决朝鲜战争问题  并主张听取朝鲜战争中双方的意见

　　马立克在安理会上斥奥斯汀阻挠阴谋
    坚持和平解决朝鲜战争问题
    并主张听取朝鲜战争中双方的意见
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：安理会十七日在马立克主持下举行常会。马立克在宣布开会后，宣称：在紧接着这次公开会议以前，安理会各理事国曾举行秘密会议，就前次会议中所产生的问题交换意见。马立克指出：秘密会议的参加者认为最好是继续进行交换意见。
    马立克于是请第一个发言人，古巴代表阿尔渥里兹发言。阿尔渥里兹摹仿着美国代表奥斯汀和英国代表杰伯以前所发表的论调。他提出控诉，因为没有邀请李承晚集团的代表参加安理会的会议。他的演说充斥着无数诽谤苏联的谰言，阿尔渥里兹在结束其演说时责备苏联和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。
    接着发言的是美国代表奥斯汀。奥斯汀发表长篇演说，他说明了：就美国的观点看来，怎样才是他认为替帝国主义者解决朝鲜问题的“满意”办法。他承认他所追求的实质上就是北朝鲜和南朝鲜隶属于美国。
    奥斯汀演说时一开始就赞成阿尔渥里兹对马立克主持安理会的攻击，硬说马立克阻碍安理会的“正规程序”。奥斯汀伪善地声称美国只希望和平，他说：美国已下定决心去支持联合国的宗旨，美国无意利用朝鲜作为军事基地。奥斯汀主张由联合国成立一个委员会，赴战区协助建立秩序，把战争转变为“健全的和平”。奥斯汀说了一连串攻击苏联代表和苏联的粗鲁谰言，指责苏联缺乏促进联合国团结的愿望。奥斯汀企图把朝鲜战争的责任推诿到苏联身上。奥斯汀设法推卸美国侵略朝鲜的责任，他说：如果苏联现在愿意施用它的影响，那末，朝鲜和平的破坏就会永远终止了。
    接着发言的是国民党代表蒋廷黻，他奴颜婢膝地努力为美英集团辩护，反对苏联对帝国主义侵略亚洲的谴责。蒋廷黻在其演说中说了好些卑鄙的、敌视苏联的话。他说完后，南斯拉夫代表贝勃拉接着演说，他说他欢迎印度的倡议。
    下一个发言人挪威代表森德再度提出有关李承晚代表列席安理会会议的程序问题；他提出长篇遵守法律的道理来说明英美集团立场的“合理性”，这个集团希望李承晚代表列席而不肯听取朝鲜人民代表的意见。
    马立克随即以苏联代表的资格发表演说。他答复了奥斯汀的论调，并保留发言权，说如果苏联代表团认为有必要的话，将稍后再作答复。
    马立克指出：他竭力想在奥斯汀的演说中找出些新的东西来，但却一点也找不到。奥斯汀的演说中虽然有些新的字句，但是实质却原封未动。奥斯汀避开美国侵略朝鲜人民这一基本事实不谈；奥斯汀并没有回答苏联代表团所提出的事实及论据。马立克指出：奥斯汀在其演说中企图转移世界公众及安理会对朝鲜实际情况的注意。马立克说：由于美国的野蛮轰炸，朝鲜人民正在流血，妇女、儿童及老人正被屠杀，人民的财产正被破坏。成千美国士兵在那里死去；美国的报界报道：成千成万的人死在那里，他们并不知道他们为什么要打仗，为什么而死。马立克说：奥斯汀避免答复这些问题，却不着边际地谈论着将来前途的问题。
    马立克继续说：安理会面临着和平解决朝鲜战争的问题，这个问题一定要得到解决。但是，美国并不想解决这个问题，美国代表团对苏联提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的提案横加阻挠。在马歇尔化国家（这些国家正受到压力）的支持下，美国阻挠了苏联建议。美国阻止听取朝鲜战争中的双方的意见。马立克问道：不听取战争双方卷入战争的两个政府阵营的意见，怎样谈得上和平解决呢？任何客观的、懂道理的人都一定会下这样的结论：应该听取双方的意见。根据常识和联合国宪章的条款，这一点是明明白白的。但是美国却反对这样作。美国提出扩大战争的侵略建议，扬言要派遣更多的军队去朝鲜，要更多的人去送死，仅仅是因为美国的统治集团要这样。为了要掩盖它的侵略意图，美国代表又一次谈到苏联的影响。但是苏联决不会像美国那样，决不会像艾奇逊在五月选举期间在李承晚身上运用影响那样，运用它的影响。
    马立克追述说：苏联代表团已宣布过它准备在安理会中参加朝鲜问题的和平解决。但是，美国政府及其代表团正在破坏苏联和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，阻挠苏联要求听取双方意见的合法建议之通过。因此，美国代表团就阻挠了安理会考虑和平解决朝鲜问题。马立克继称，苏联是准备通过安理会积极参加对朝鲜问题的和平解决的。但美国不愿意如此，因为它是靠着扩大战争而不是靠着和平解决来赌博的。
    马立克继而讲到奥斯汀曾说安理会蕴藏着很大的智慧，他说，如果美国统治者不曾企图把安理会变成强力与操纵的藏垢纳污之所，如果美国统治者不曾企图把安理会变成美国统治集团侵略政策的工具，那么安理会是能够而且会成为这样的机构的。
    马立克讲到联合国宪章规定以安理会为维持国际和平的主要机关。他要求安理会执行其神圣的义务，使朝鲜问题和平解决。然而，马立克再度指出，由于美国及其附庸国家的反对，这样的建议也碰了壁。
    在答复森德所说的北朝鲜当局不想和安理会发生任何关系这种论点时，马立克指出，这种说法是与事实不符的。马立克追述说，从联合国组织的纪录上可以看出，当联合国大会考虑朝鲜问题时，美英集团曾阻止北朝鲜的代表出席。在目前，美英集团又在安理会实行着同样的步骤。
    马立克发言后安理会遂即休会，俟八月二十二日再行开会。
