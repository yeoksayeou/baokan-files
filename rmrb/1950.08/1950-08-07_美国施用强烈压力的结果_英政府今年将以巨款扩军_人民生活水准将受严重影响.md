　　Xinhua News Agency, London, August 5th: The "Workers' Daily" reports: Government military experts told the cabinet that this year's military expenditure "should" be increased to 1.1 billion pounds, replacing the original estimate of 780 million pounds. Experts believe that Shinwell's statement to the House of Commons last week that rearmament would require an additional 100 million pounds was a gross underestimation of the costs required. Experts believe that the first phase of Britain's rearmament will require at least 300 million pounds this year, and even more funds will be needed in the next year. The "Workers' Daily" reported: The new estimate was drafted in consultation with the Cabinet's Economic Planning Committee and submitted to the Defense Committee meeting chaired by Attlee on July 31. The "Workers' Daily" continued: The cabinet reluctantly agreed to these plans after strong pressure was applied by the United States at the meeting of the Assistant Foreign Ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in London this week. The United States told Britain and other countries that 12 percent of their national income must be used for military expenditure.
　　On August 2nd, British Defense Minister Shinwell arrived in France. He is prepared to discuss with French Defense Minister Moch how much Moch can persuade the French government to contribute. British Foreign Secretary Bevin is conducting similar negotiations with other Brussels Treaty countries in The Hague, and these behind-the-scenes negotiations will continue at the Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg.
　　Referring to the British government's new measures, the political correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" pointed out: "The plans under consideration by the government will have a serious impact on domestic living standards, asset investment plans, and the balance of payments overseas."

　　美国施用强烈压力的结果
    英政府今年将以巨款扩军
    人民生活水准将受严重影响
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社伦敦四日讯：工人日报报道：政府军事专家告内阁称，本年度军费“应”提高至十一亿英镑，以代替原来估计的七亿八千万英镑。专家们相信：辛威尔上周对下院所述重整军备约需额外款项一亿英镑，乃是大大低估了所需的费用。专家们认为，英国重整军备的第一阶段，在今年至少需要三亿镑，而下一年度需款更巨。工人日报报道：新概算系会同内阁经济计划委员会草拟的，而在七月三十一日以艾德礼为主席的国防委员会会议上提出。工人日报继称：在本周举行的伦敦北大西洋战争公约外长助理会上，美国施用强烈压力之后，内阁已勉强同意这些计划。美国对英国及其他国家说：它们国民收入的百分之十二必须用作军费。
    八月二日，英国防部长辛威尔抵法。他准备与法国国防部长莫克商讨莫克可能劝导法国政府拿出多少钱来的问题。英外相贝文在海牙同其他布鲁塞尔公约国家正进行着类似的谈判，这种幕后谈判将在斯特拉斯堡召开的欧洲委员会会议上继续举行。
    在论及英国政府的新措施时，“每日电讯报”的政治记者指出：“政府所考虑的计划，对国内生活水准，资产投资计划和海外的支付平衡有严重的影响。”
