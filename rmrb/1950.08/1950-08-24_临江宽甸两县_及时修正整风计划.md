　　Linjiang and Kuandian Counties
    Promptly Revise Rectification Plans
    [Our Newspaper] After the Linjiang and Kuandian County Committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Liaodong Province clarified what to rectify and how to rectify, they revised the rectification plans. When the Linjiang County Committee began rectification and study in July, it was not clear what the focus of the rectification was and how to rectify it. Therefore, the focus was not on rectifying the county committee's policy and ideology and work style, but on rectifying general departments and cadres. After the Tonghua District County-Level Party Member Cadre Conference pointed this out on July 19, the Linjiang County Committee re-formulated the rectification plan. It clearly put forward that the focus of the rectification was on the county committee's grasp of agricultural production policies, urban taxation, and industrial and commercial policies, as well as the bureaucratic and commandist work style. While rectifying the county committee, some cadres were also sent to rural areas and towns to understand the implementation of the various tasks deployed by the Provincial Party Committee's May meeting; at the same time, reflections from various district committees were solicited. In various agencies and departments, work was inspected through seminars to absorb opinions from below. The Kuandian County inspected the rectification plan based on the opinions put forward at the district-level and above cadre meeting from August 1 to 4, and found some improprieties. For example, the rectification plan stipulated rectification of "affairs." However, some cadres' opinions on the county committee were: "Focusing only on leading central work, neglecting the inspection of general work and departmental work, resulting in problems in the coordination of departmental work with the central work that cannot be solved." They also pointed out that the county committee had complacency and undemocratic phenomena. For example, "To a certain extent, the county committee is satisfied with the percentage of numbers and ignores specific inspections." "The county committee itself lacks the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The party committee system is not sound." After consideration, the county committee believed that although these opinions were not comprehensive enough, they did illustrate that there were shortcomings in the county committee's leadership in these aspects. Therefore, it was finally decided to revise the original plan.

　　临江宽甸两县
    及时修正整风计划
    【本报讯】辽东省临江、宽甸两县中共县委弄清了整什么怎么整后，重新修改了整风计划。临江县委七月开始整风学习时，关于整风的重点是什么，怎么整，是不明确的。因此没有把整顿县委政策思想和工作作风作为重点，而着重整顿一般部门和干部。经七月十九日通化地区县级党员干部会议指出之后，临江县委重新制订了整风计划。明确提出整风重点，是整县委对农业生产政策、对城市的税收、工商业政策的掌握和工作上的官僚主义、命令主义的作风。在整县委的同时，还抽派一部分干部深入农村城镇，了解临江县对省委五月会议所布置的各项工作的贯彻情形；同时征集各区委的反映。各机关部门中，以开座谈会检查工作，吸收下面的意见。宽甸县根据八月一日至四日区级以上干部会议所提的意见，检查了整风计划，发现有不妥善处。例如整风计划上规定整“事务”。一部分干部对县委的意见却是：“光注意领导中心工作，忽视了对一般工作、部门工作的检查，使部门工作在配合中心工作发生的问题，得不到解决”。以及提出县委有自满和不民主现象。如：“在某种程度上，县委满足于数目字的百分比，忽视具体的检查。”“县委本身批评与自我批评的精神不够。党委制不健全。”县委经过考虑后，认为这些意见虽然不够全面，但确实说明了县委领导上是存在这方面的缺点的。所以最后确定修改原来的计划。
