　　Rectification Begins in Central and Southern Regions
    Some Shortcomings Found in Certain Areas
    [News from this newspaper] Rectification has successively begun in various parts of Central and Southern China. The Central China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Instructions on Cadre Rectification." The South China Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee raised the issue of rectifying the ideology and work style of cadres at the South China Regional Propaganda Work Conference and issued rectification instructions. The Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately convened a joint meeting of prefectural committee secretaries on July 13 to summarize the grain requisition and rent reduction work and to review the work based on the spirit of the documents. The conference of party representatives convened by Henan Province for rectification is currently underway. Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan will also convene conferences of party representatives in early August to summarize work and conduct rectification. In the process of rectification in various regions, documents such as Stalin's and Mao Zedong's on criticism and self-criticism are first studied, and work is reviewed based on the spirit of the documents, criticizing and correcting bureaucratic and commandist work styles. Some areas have also launched a study of the Land Reform Law.
    In some areas, the rectification has revealed that due to cadres' poor understanding of policies and the existence of serious commandism, many deviations have occurred in the work. The Huanggang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hubei Province found that in the past rent reduction and other movements, a total of 486 middle peasant households were infringed upon, 11 industrial and commercial households were wrongly struggled against, and a total of 152 people were tied, hung, and beaten in the whole county. At the joint meeting of district committee secretaries of the Ruijin County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Jiangxi Province, it was found that a total of 276 people were arrested arbitrarily in rent reduction and other work. The above deviations have been analyzed and criticized in the rectification in various regions, and resolute corrections are being made.

　　中南各地开始整风
    部分地区已发现若干缺点
    【本报讯】中南各地先后开始整风。中共中央中南局颁发了“关于干部整风指示”，中共中央华南分局在华南区宣传工作会议上提出关于整顿干部思想作风的问题，并颁发了整风指示。中共广西省委即于七月十三日召开地委书记联席会议，总结征粮与减租工作，并根据文件的精神检查工作。河南省为整风而召开的党代表会议目前正在进行。江西、湖北、湖南也将于八月初旬召开党代表会议，总结工作，进行整风。各地进行整风中，先学习斯大林、毛泽东论批评与自我批评等文件，根据文件精神检查工作，批判与纠正官僚主义、命令主义作风。有的地区，并展开了对土地改革法的学习。
    有些地区在整风中，已发现由于干部对政策了解很差，和存在着严重的命令主义作风，致在工作中产生了不少偏向。中共湖北黄冈县委发现过去减租等运动中，全县共侵犯中农四百八十六户，错斗工商业十一户，共捆、吊、打一百五十二人。中共江西瑞金县委区委书记联席会上，发现在减租等工作中，共乱捕了二百七十六人。以上偏向，各地在整风中，均进行了分析批判，并坚决进行纠正。
