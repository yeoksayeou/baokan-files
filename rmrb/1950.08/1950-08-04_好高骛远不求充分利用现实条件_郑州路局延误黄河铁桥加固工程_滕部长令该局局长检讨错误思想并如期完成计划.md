Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Regarding the Jinghan Railway's Yellow River Railway Bridge, which is still usable despite having exceeded two warranty periods, should we proceed from realistic conditions and carry out reinforcement work to extend its lifespan and improve its efficiency, or should we, driven by overreaching ambitions, abandon it and wait for a new bridge to be built? These are two different attitudes towards how to carry out the economic recovery of the motherland under the current situation of national financial difficulty. The responsible personnel of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau adopted the latter attitude. The bureau's leaders passively delayed the Yellow River Railway Bridge reinforcement project, which the Ministry of Railways had designated as the bureau's top priority for this year, and only completed six percent of the entire project by July 13, when Minister Teng Daiyuan personally inspected it. However, the Ministry of Railways originally stipulated that it should be completed by the end of September, and strive to complete the main project before the flood season. The bureau had delayed for a long time in making the reinforcement plan and budget this spring; it was also late in collecting the pneumatic drills (for drilling rivet holes) allocated by the Ministry of Railways, and did not use them after collection, using manual drilling and riveting for two months, resulting in extremely low work efficiency. The bureau also failed to send capable engineers to supervise the construction, and only sent three technical personnel lacking experience and ability. While the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Railways should also bear some responsibility for the delay in the reinforcement project, the main reason is that the leading personnel of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau did not consider the problem based on the current financial situation, did not adhere to the principle of making the best use of everything, and did not improve the work based on realistic conditions, but only waited for the Ministry of Railways to build a new bridge; at the same time, they did not realize that even if a new bridge were built immediately, it would still be absolutely necessary to carry out reinforcement to maintain the operation of the old bridge and improve its efficiency before the new bridge was completed.

During the Kuomintang rule, the bridge had already been abandoned by the railway bureau because it had exceeded its warranty period, resulting in years of disrepair and extremely low traffic efficiency on the bridge. After liberation, local railway workers followed the old habits and did not make improvements. In November last year, after a bridge inspection team from the Ministry of Railways, with the participation of Soviet experts, conducted on-site surveys, carried out precise calculations, and tested the steel quality, it was determined that the bridge could continue to be used. In fact, after accepting the order from the Ministry of Railways to carry out preliminary reinforcement work, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau had already increased the speed of traffic on the bridge from five kilometers per hour to twenty-five kilometers, and the traction force had also doubled. However, this fact did not change the technical conservatism and bureaucratic style of the responsible personnel of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. In addition to severely criticizing the responsible personnel of the bureau, Minister Teng ordered the bureau director to deeply examine past ideological errors, and ordered the bureau to immediately step up its work and ensure that the reinforcement plan is completed as scheduled by the end of September.

Editor's Note: The attitude taken by the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau towards the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Jinghan Railway is not unique to the Zhengzhou Bureau, but also exists to varying degrees among staff in other railway departments and other economic sectors. For example, in some factories and mines, many of the production equipment that should be used have not been fully utilized, and the equipment that could be used has not been effectively used. Some responsible personnel are accustomed to reaching out to higher authorities for money and things, accustomed to fantasizing about building a new set, and are not good at using existing materials to maximize their role under existing conditions. The result is bound to cause great losses in work. This should arouse the vigilance of all economic workers.

　　好高骛远不求充分利用现实条件
    郑州路局延误黄河铁桥加固工程
    滕部长令该局局长检讨错误思想并如期完成计划
    【新华社三十日讯】对于虽然已经超过两个保固期限但是仍然可以使用的京汉路黄河铁桥，究竟是从现实条件出发，进行加固工程以延长其寿命、提高其使用效率呢，还是好高鹜远地弃置不管、坐待另建新桥呢？这是在目前国家财政困难的情况下，对待如何进行祖国经济恢复工作的两种不同的态度。郑州铁路管理局的负责人员采取了后面一种态度。该局负责人对于铁道部列作该局今年首要工作的黄河铁桥加固工程，消极拖延，一直到七月十三日滕代远部长亲往视察时，才仅仅完成全工程的百分之六。而铁道部原来却规定要在九月底完工，并争取在洪水前把主要工程作好。该局在今春作加固计划和加固预算时就曾拖延很久；对铁道部拨给的打风机（钻孔铆钉用）也迟不领取，领取后又不动用，两个月来全用人工钻孔铆钉，因此工作效率极低。该局且未派得力工程师督导施工，而只派了三个缺乏经验和能力的技术人员。固然铁道部工务总局对于加固工程的延误也应负一定责任，但主要地是由于郑州铁路管理局领导人员没有根据目前财政情况来考虑问题，不是本物尽其用的原则以现实条件为基础来改进工作，而一味等待铁道部另建新桥；同时也没有认识即使立刻另建新桥，而在新桥未落成以前，为保持旧桥通车并提高其效率，进行加固仍然是万分必要的。
    该桥还在国民党统治时期，就因超过了保固期限而被路局弃置不管，以致年久失修，桥上行车效率极低。解放后，当地铁路工作人员因循旧习，没有进行改善。到了去年十一月，经有苏联专家参加的铁道部桥梁视察团到现场勘察，进行精密计算并化验钢质，结果判明该桥仍可继续使用。事实上，郑州铁路管理局在接受铁道部命令进行初步加固工程以后，已经使该桥上的行车速度由每小时五公里提高到二十五公里，牵引力也提高了一倍。然而这一事实并没有改变郑州铁路管理局负责人员在技术上的保守主义和工作上的官僚主义。这次滕部长除已对该局负责人员进行严厉批评，令该局局长深刻检讨过去思想错误外，并责成该局立即加紧工作，务必在九月底如期完成加固计划。
    按：郑州铁路管理局对于京汉路黄河铁桥所采取的态度，不仅在郑州局，就是在其他铁路部门以及其他经济部门工作人员中也或多或少地存在着。如在有的工厂矿山中本来应该运用的生产设备却有不少还没有被充分利用，本来可以使用的器材却没有被有效使用。有些负责人员习惯于向上级伸手要钱要东西，习惯于空想从新建设一套，而不善于在现有条件下使现有的物资发挥其高度的作用。其结果必然是造成工作上的莫大损失。这是应该引起一切经济工作人员警惕的。
