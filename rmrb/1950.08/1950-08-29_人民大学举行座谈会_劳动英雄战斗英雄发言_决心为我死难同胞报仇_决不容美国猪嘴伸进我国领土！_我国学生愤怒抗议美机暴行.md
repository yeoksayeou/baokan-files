　　Renmin University Holds Symposium
    Labor Heroes and Combat Heroes Speak
    Determined to Avenge Our Compatriots Who Died
    Absolutely Not Allowing American Pig Snouts to Extend Into Our Territory!
    Chinese Students Angrily Protest American Air Raids
    [Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon (the 28th), Renmin University held a symposium attended by labor heroes, combat heroes, veterans of the Long March, and student representatives. Everyone unanimously expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and the just call to the UN Security Council, demanding retribution for the blood debt of American imperialism's aggression against China, and demanding that the US imperialist atrocities of aggression against Korea be stopped. Furthermore, they expressed that the Chinese people have the strength to crush any shameless provocations by American imperialism, resolutely liberate Taiwan, and absolutely not allow even an inch of American imperialism's pig snout to extend into our sacred territory.
    Women's labor hero Li Fenglian said: "We have arduously exchanged our sacrifices, our blood and sweat for the new China. It is a dream for American imperialism to try to occupy even a bit of new China's land. The American aggression against Taiwan and this aggression against the Northeast are not only not allowed by our students, but also not allowed by the entire Chinese people and the people of the world. We resolutely demand that the American government punish the murderers and compensate us for all our losses." Li Huanchang, a student who came to the university from the People's Liberation Army field army, said: "American imperialism is even more blatantly invading us. It vainly attempts to use strafing to intimidate the Chinese people, but it is wrong. This has precisely aroused the anger of the Chinese people. The blood of our dead compatriots cannot be shed in vain. We must demand that the American imperialists pay this blood debt, and demand that the Security Council stop the American imperialist acts of aggression."
    Labor hero Mao Mengyin, model worker of military industry three times Li Caihai, and veteran of the Long March Su Lin unanimously stated: "The direct acts of aggression by American imperialism have further exposed the barbarity and shamelessness of American imperialism, and unmasked Austin's sophistry in the Security Council. The Chinese people have long recognized the ferocious face of American imperialism. The White Paper is their confession. The Chinese people love peace, but are not afraid of war." Zhu Wenyuan, a fifteen-year-old worker who worked at the Fuxin Coal Mine, was selected as a model Communist Party member for his selfless work in the restoration of the Northeast. Recalling the past, he said angrily: "Last year in Shenyang, the former American consul Wald beat our worker brothers. All the miners protested this atrocity and drove him out of China, because the Chinese working class has stood up today. Today, American imperialism is again infringing upon our sovereignty, and we will never allow it."
    Ren Xianzhi, a veteran of the Long March, said: "American imperialism is militarily invading Korea. The Korean People's Army has given it a head-on blow, and now it is even more frantically invading our territory. Imperialists have the hearts and lungs of wolves and will struggle until the day they die. We should always remember Chairman Mao's words: 'We will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counter-attack.'" He recalled that in the battle on the outskirts of Shenyang, their team, together with factory cadres, annihilated two Kuomintang cavalry brigades, including many Americans. He said, "Those tall Americans, like telephone poles, all raised their hands and surrendered. The American army is nothing to be afraid of."
    The students who participated in the symposium unanimously expressed that they would strengthen their studies and accelerate the completion of their studies.
    Comrade Li Fenglian proposed a suggestion to send condolences to the families of the compatriots who died on the Yalu River in Northeast China, which was unanimously agreed upon. (Su Xing)

　　人民大学举行座谈会
    劳动英雄战斗英雄发言
    决心为我死难同胞报仇
    决不容美国猪嘴伸进我国领土！
    我国学生愤怒抗议美机暴行
    【本报讯】中国人民大学，昨（二十八）日下午举行了由劳动英雄、战斗英雄长征战士和学生会代表参加的座谈会。大家一致表示坚决拥护周外长的抗议，和对联合国安理会的正义的呼声，要求讨还美帝国主义侵略中国的血债，要求制止美帝侵略朝鲜的暴行。并且表示中国人民有力量粉碎美帝国主义的任何无耻的挑衅行为，坚决解放台湾，绝不容许美帝的猪嘴巴伸进我们神圣的国土一分一厘。
    妇女劳动英雄李凤莲说：“我们艰苦地用牺牲、用血汗换来了新中国。美帝国想侵占新中国的一点土地都是作梦。美国侵略台湾和这次侵略东北的罪行，不但我们同学不允许，全中国人民和全世界人民都不允许，我们坚决要求美国政府惩办凶手，赔偿我们的一切损失。”从人民解放军野战部队来校学习的李焕昌同学说：“美帝国主义更加明显的侵略我们了，它妄图用飞机扫射来吓倒中国人民，但是他想错了，这却正激起了中国人民的愤怒。我们死难同胞的血不能白流，我们要向美帝讨还这笔血债，要求安理会制止美帝的侵略行为。”
    劳动英雄毛梦银同志三次军工模范李才海和长征老战士苏林同志一致表示：“美帝的直接侵略行为，更加暴露了美帝的野蛮无耻，揭穿了奥斯汀在安理会上的狡辩。中国人民早已认清了美帝的狞恶面貌，白皮书就是他们的供状。中国人民是爱好和平的，但并不怕战争。”在阜新煤矿作工的十五岁工人朱文远同志，由于他在恢复东北建设中的舍身忘我的工作曾被选为模范共产党员，他回忆起过去的日子他激愤的说：“去年我在沈阳，美国前领事瓦尔德殴打我们工人兄弟，全矿工人都抗议这种暴行，并把他驱出了中国，因为中国工人阶级今天站起来了。今天美帝又来侵犯我们的主权，我们绝不允许。”
    长征老战士任先智说：“美帝国主义武装侵略朝鲜，朝鲜人民军给予他一个迎头的打击，现在更加猖狂的侵略我们的国土了。帝国主义狼心狗肺，一天不死一天就要挣扎，我们应永远记着毛主席的话：‘人不犯我，我不犯人，人如犯我，我必犯人。’”他追溯在沈阳外围的战役中他们一队接受工厂的干部曾消灭了包括有许多美国人的国民党两个骑兵旅，他说：“那些美国人高个子象电线杆子一样的都举手投降了，美国军队没有什么可怕。”
    参加座谈会的同学们，一致表示要加强学习、加速完成学习任务。
    李凤莲同志提出对在东北鸭绿江边死难同胞家属进行慰问的建议全体一致同意。（苏星）
