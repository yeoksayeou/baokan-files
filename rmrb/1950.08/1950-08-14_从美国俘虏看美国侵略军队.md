　　Looking at the American Aggressor Troops Through the Eyes of American Prisoners of War
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Guiliang
　　On July 28th and August 3rd, this reporter visited American prisoner-of-war camps in Bird Rock Courtyard and Seoul. Among the 381 American officers and soldiers we saw, not one expressed that he was fighting to support the American policy of aggression. This is not to say that they all consciously opposed American policy, but rather that the vast majority of them, from the time they enlisted to the time they were captured, simply did not understand and never thought about what American policy was.
　　Among the 192 prisoners of war in the Bird Rock Courtyard American prisoner-of-war camp, apart from eight or nine veterans of more than five years (i.e., those who enlisted before 1945), the rest were recruits with less than two or three years of service. The motives for these recruits to enlist and the circumstances of their capture can be explained by the words of Corporal Kimball of the U.S. Army's 8054th Field Hospital.
　　Kimball said: "In the United States, it is difficult to find a job, so I do whatever I can. I am twenty-three years old this year, and I have worked as a truck driver, boxer, wrestler, and motorcycle rider in a circus. The reason I joined the army was to save some money to prepare for future schooling and supporting my family. I joined the American occupation army stationed in Japan because I wanted to see Japan and live there for a few years. I thought it was peacetime, so there wouldn't be any fighting. No one expected that after the Korean War broke out, we would really go to the battlefield. Before we set off, our superiors told us that we were not going to fight, but to do something similar to police work. But we encountered combat. The Koreans can shoot at you, and you can't even see them. When you are paying attention to the empty mountains, suddenly the mountains are full of soldiers, and they are shooting at you. What can you do? Before they shout 'Stop!' you can't see them at all, and by the time you see them, it's too late. The retreat route has been cut off, and the People's Army is all around, ordering you to raise your hands. That's how I was captured."
　　First Lieutenant Glenberg, the company commander of the First Company, Second Battalion, 27th Regiment, 24th Division of the U.S. Army, told a similar story. He had been drafted into the army once and returned to civilian life in 1947 to study at the University of Hawaii. In 1949, his father (an engineer) retired due to old age, and his life was not guaranteed. He had to drop out of school to support his family, so he re-enlisted. He said: "In the United States, being a soldier is a very good and easy job to find. I received military training in Japan, eating well and drinking well. My parents and fiancée can also get some subsidies, isn't that great?" He landed in Busan with his troops on July 10th and arrived at the Hwanggan Yongdong front on the 14th, and was immediately attacked by the People's Army. He said, "We hurriedly retreated to a valley, thinking of hiding here for the night. But before dawn, we found that we had been surrounded by the People's Army. At this time, we had no other way to survive except to surrender."
　　Major Lantren, the battalion commander of the regiment of the 34th Regiment, 24th Division of the U.S. Army, was still sleeping when he was captured northwest of Daejeon. This veteran, who had been in the American army for six years, shamelessly admitted: "The morale of us American soldiers is really incomparable to that of the Korean People's Army. They continuously fight in the mountains without fatigue. We are too tired to support it anymore."
　　After seeing with their own eyes their own planes frantically and blindly bombing peaceful Korean residents, and the fact that the entire South Korean people have been mobilized to support the People's Army, the attitude of the American prisoners of war has begun to change a little. Major Dunham, who belonged to the same regiment as Lantren, still quibbled when he first saw us in Bird Rock Courtyard. When he saw us for the second time in Seoul, he had to admit: "We Americans are intentionally destroying this place and killing the people here. The South Korean people hate us and the government of the past five years (referring to the Rhee Syngman puppet government). Seeing what we Americans are doing, I feel ashamed." Another Major Bartell of the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion, who was captured in Gongju, was a veteran who had been in the army for nineteen years. He told reporters about his feelings after being captured: "When I was first captured, I decided to turn a deaf ear to anything the Koreans told me. But you don't have to listen, just look. Everything I saw on the way north made me begin to doubt what we Americans were doing. You can see that the South Korean people are willing to follow North Korea. The more the People's Army advances south, the more support they get from the people, and no one supports Rhee Syngman. If we Americans don't interfere, the war will end within ten days after it starts. Because of American intervention, the war has been prolonged, and tens of thousands more lives have been sacrificed. America should be smarter and withdraw from Korea quickly. I don't want to say more about fighting. Because, for a veteran, retreat and surrender are shameful, especially when he knows that the object he is hurting is the common people."
　　Lieutenant Thomson, a fighter pilot on the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet aircraft carrier "Furnace Valley," confessed that American planes were ordered to indiscriminately bomb peaceful towns and people in Korea, saying: "Because the Korean People's Army is advancing too fast, our bombing and strafing missions do not have specific locations or specific targets. The order stipulates: Any target can be bombed and strafed."
　　When they were bombing and strafing the Korean people, even American prisoners of war were sacrificed. That U.S. Army Corporal Kimball suffered personally. He said: "When we came from south to north, six prisoners of war and two People's Army guards walked in a single line on the highway. Suddenly, an F-80 American fighter plane flew over. At this time, we raised our hands to show that we were prisoners of war. The fighter plane dived to a height of 500 feet. The pilot could clearly see that we were prisoners of war, but he killed three of our companions. Among the three of us prisoners of war who did not die, one was so frightened that he could not move. When we were resting in the fields, some farmers were hoeing the ground. This attracted another F-80 bombing and strafing. The pilot used everything he had: two rocket launchers, half-inch and 20 mm caliber machine guns each, and a parachute time bomb. Continuing forward, we saw seven farmers' bodies lying in a paddy field, and three farmers died in another paddy field. The plane came again. I immediately crawled into the paddy field, regardless of whether it was water or mud, as long as I could survive. I cannot agree with my country doing this. After seeing this situation with my own eyes, I decided not to fight anymore. This is a civil war, and we Americans should not be messing around in it."
　　A sergeant named Graf, who was captured near Daejeon, told reporters: "Before we raised our hands to surrender, two people objected and were beaten to death by us. The reason why those two people refused to surrender was because they believed MacArthur's words, thinking that they would definitely be shot by the People's Army after surrendering. In fact, MacArthur said that in order for us to continue fighting."
　　This reporter's visit to the American prisoner-of-war camp has deepened the understanding that on the one hand, the officers and soldiers of the American imperialist aggressor army are profit-driven, crazy and cruel, and on the other hand, they are very afraid of death, cowardly and incompetent. The "superior weapons" boasted by the Americans can only intimidate the neurasthenic.

### 从美国俘虏看美国侵略军队

　　从美国俘虏看美国侵略军队
    新华社记者  刘桂梁
    记者于七月二十八日和八月三日在鸟致院和汉城两度访问了美军战俘营。在我们所见到的三百八十一名美军官兵俘虏中，没有一个人表示他是为支持美国的侵略政策而打仗的。这并不是说，他们都自觉地反对美国的政策，而是说明他们当中的绝大部分人从入伍到被俘，根本就不了解也从来没想过美国的政策是什么。
    在鸟致院美军战俘营的一百九十二名俘虏中，除了八、九名是五年以上的老兵（即一九四五年以前入伍者）外，其余都是入伍不到两三年的新兵。这些新兵入伍的动机和被俘的经过，可以用美军八○五四野战医院的下士金鲍尔的话来说明。
    金鲍尔说：“在美国，很难找到职业，因此我能干什么就干什么。我今年二十三岁，曾做过卡车司机、拳师、摔跤者和马戏团的摩托车手。我所以参加军队，是为了积蓄一点钱，以备将来读书和养家之用。我参加美国驻日占领军，是想到日本看一看，住上他几年。我想，反正是和平时期的军队，又不会打仗。谁也没料到在朝鲜战争发生后，我们真的上了战场。在我们出发前，上级告诉我们不是去打仗，而是去做类似警察的工作。但是我们却遇上了战斗。朝鲜人能开枪打你，而你连看也看不见他们。当你正注意着空山的时候，突然间满山都是兵，并向你射击了。这可有什么办法呢？在他们喊你‘站住！’之前，你根本看不到他们，等你看见的时候，已经太晚了。后路已被切断，四面八方全是人民军，命令你举手。我就是这样被俘的。”
    原美军第二十四师第二十七团第二营第一连少尉连长葛兰勃讲了相似的故事。他曾一度被征入伍，一九四七年复员后入夏威夷大学念书，一九四九年，他父亲（一个工程师）因年老退休，生活没有保障。他不得不辍学供养家庭，于是再度入伍。他说：“在美国，当兵是一种很好而又容易找到的职业。我在日本受军事训练，吃好的，喝好的。我的父母和未婚妻也可以得到一些补助，这不是很好吗？”他随部队于七月十日在釜山登陆，十四日开到黄涧永同前线，随即遭到人民军的进攻，他说：“我们急忙退到一个山谷里，心想先在这里躲藏一夜。但是还没有等到天明，我们就发现已被人民军包围了。这时我们除了投降之外，已没有任何其他活路。”
    原美军第二十四师团第三十四团联队少校营长蓝特伦在大田西北被俘时，还正在睡觉。这个在美国部队里混了六年的老兵毫不怕羞地供认说：“我们美国兵的士气实在无法和朝鲜人民军相比。他们连续在山地作战而不知疲倦。我们可累得再不能支持了。”
    美军战俘们在亲眼看到他们自己的飞机疯狂地盲目轰炸朝鲜和平居民，和南朝鲜全体人民业已动员起来支援人民军的事实之后，态度已开始有了一点转变。一名和蓝特伦属于同一团的少校邓哈姆在鸟致院第一次见到我们时还进行过诡辩。而在汉城第二次见到我们时已不得不承认：“我们美国人正在有意地破坏这个地方，杀这里的人民。南朝鲜人民憎恨我们和过去五年的政府（指李承晚傀儡政府）。我看到我们美国人所做的事情，感觉到羞耻。”另一个在公州被俘的第六十三野炮营的少校巴特尔是一个入伍十九年的老兵。他对记者述说他被俘后的感想说：“我刚刚被俘时，决定充耳不闻朝鲜人告诉我的任何事情。但是，你无需乎听，看看也就够了。在北上途中所看到的一切，使我开始怀疑我们美国人在做什么。你可以看见南朝鲜人民愿意跟着北朝鲜走。人民军愈往南进，他们就得到更多人民的支持，没有一个人支持李承晚。如果我们美国不加干涉，战争在开始后的十天内就会结束。由于美国的干涉，战争拖长了一些，而且多牺牲了几万人的性命。美国应该放聪明些，赶快退出朝鲜。关于打仗的事情，我不愿再多说什么。因为，对于一个老兵来说，退却与投降是可耻的，特别是当他晓得他所伤害的对象是老百姓的时候。”
    原美海军第七舰队航空母舰“熔炉谷”号上的战斗机少尉驾驶员汤姆逊，供认了美国飞机奉命滥炸朝鲜的和平城镇和人民，他说：“由于朝鲜人民军进展得太快，我们轰炸扫射的任务，并没有确定的地点与确定的目标。命令规定：任何目标都可以轰炸扫射。”
    当他们轰炸扫射朝鲜人民的时候，连美军俘虏也作了牺牲者。那个美军下士金鲍尔就曾身受其害。他说：“我们从南往北来的时候，六个俘虏和两个人民军卫兵排成单行在公路上走。突然飞来了一架Ｆ八十型的美国战斗机，我们这时举起手来表示我们是俘虏。那架战斗机俯冲到五百英尺的高度，驾驶员明明可以看清楚我们是俘虏，他却打死了我们中间的三个伙伴。我们三个没有死的俘虏中，有一个人被吓得不能行动。当我们在田地里休息的时候，有些农民正在锄地。又引来了一架Ｆ八十型的炸射。那个驾驶员把他所有的东西全部使出来了：两个火箭筒，半英寸和二十糎口径的机枪各一，还有一颗降落伞定时炸弹。继续前行，看见一块稻田里躺着七个农民的尸体，另一块稻田里死了三个农民。飞机又来了。我立刻爬在稻田里，不管是水是泥，只要能活命。我不能同意我的国家这样做法。我亲眼看到这种情况后，决心不再打仗了。这是一个内战，我们美国人不应该在里边捣乱。”
    一个在大田附近被俘的中士格拉甫对记者说：“我们举手投降之前，曾有两个人反对，被我们打死了。他们两个人所以拒绝投降，是因为他们信了麦克阿瑟的话，以为投降之后一定被人民军枪毙，其实，麦克阿瑟说那话，为的是要我们继续作战。”
    记者访问了美军战俘营，更加深切地认识到：美帝国主义侵略军队的官军们一方面是利欲熏心，疯狂残忍，而一方面又是十分贪生怕死、懦弱无能。美国人所夸耀的“优越武器”只能威吓神经衰弱的人。
