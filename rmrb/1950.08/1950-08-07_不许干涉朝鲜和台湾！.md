　　No Interference in Korea and Taiwan!
    By William Z. Foster, Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States
    The Cold War is becoming more and more outrageous. President Truman announced that the United States had launched a hot war without a declaration of war against all the nations of Asia and the Pacific. The U.S. Navy and Air Force are in Korea. The Seventh Fleet is in the Taiwan Strait. American military forces in the Philippines have been strengthened. Full military assistance is being given to the French imperialists in Indochina, and an American military mission is now directing operations in that region.
    It was only after orders were issued, destroyers dispatched, and bombs dropped that Truman "leisurely" informed the American people and the United Nations that a war without a declaration of war had begun.
    I'm afraid we were forewarned. About a week or so ago, Secretary of State Acheson admitted: "The words 'Cold War' send chills down people's spines." He suggested replacing them with the words "peace through strength."
    Call it what you will, we are faced with a policy of naked armed struggle for imperialist hegemony in the Far East – where hundreds of millions of people are fighting and struggling for some of the rights that we Americans won in 1776.
    Since the end of World War II, world peace has never faced such a grave danger. What is our response to this challenge? Should we now rush to seek avoidance? Must we succumb to the "inevitable" – and await atomic destruction?
    As we Communists and many others have said, I say again – even at this pre-emptive moment, a third world war is not inevitable! Peace can still be saved. We throw Mr. Acheson's words back in his teeth – yes, peace through strength, the strength of all peace-loving people united blocking and destroying the war-mongering beasts in their path.
    This means that we Americans must fulfill our assigned tasks.
    The stories we read in our country's monopoly capitalist-controlled newspapers report very little about the true situation in Asia. Whenever American workers strike, there is also little news coming from our own steel or coal cities. We are all used to seeing nonsensical headlines: "Picketers commit acts of aggression against peaceful police!" We know the real story behind this – the story of speed-up systems and starvation wages, the story of legitimate demands and inflated profits.
    Black people are fully aware of this kind of reporting. Headlines scream – Rape! But the real story concerns lynching and starvation in the Black Belt, rat-infested Harlem slums, and Black people in industry and education. The real story concerns the struggle of Black people to liberate themselves from Wall Street's oppression.
    In Asia, the real story is the collapse of an entire corrupt imperial structure. Hundreds of millions of colored people around the world are tearing down the prison walls of colonial bondage. They have had enough of their foreign masters – Japanese, British, French, or Dutch. They have seen with their own eyes that American-made imperialism is no different from any other brand.
    All that these hundreds of millions of people need, all that they are determined to obtain, is that they are the best fighters against our common enemies, the Japanese imperialists.
    Wall Street's South Korea has an armed force of 100,000. The *New York Times* on Monday morning said that they "are about the most Americanized of all the foreign troops trained by American officers." But by Monday night, the radio was chirping that Korean hearts were beating under American uniforms, and that even those mercenaries were unwilling to kill their Korean brothers with American guns.
    Repeated "Communist extermination campaigns" – following Chiang Kai-shek's lead – have only eliminated any illusions about American imperialism, and filled South Korea with hatred for its puppet Syngman Rhee.
    How much "Communist propaganda" does it take to make a nation unwilling to be loyal to suffering starvation, mass exiles, mass unemployment, and mass arrests? Syngman Rhee's group set up small anti-American activities committees in villages and neighborhoods throughout South Korea. Even the U.S.-controlled United Nations Commission on Korea had to report that under this terror, "Between September 4, 1948, and April 20, 1949, 89,710 people were arrested."
    Just yesterday, word came from Washington that "people always long for protection, afraid of midnight arrests, slave camps, and torture chambers."
    Do you know who said this? None other than Harry S. Truman. This is the man who ordered the bombing of the Korean people because they not only longed for freedom but also fought to obtain it.
    South Korea's industry has stagnated. As for agriculture, even Syngman Rhee's newspapers in Seoul had to report that agriculture was simply a matter of gradually exhausting the land, leading to famine and death. Only prisons offer you a place to settle down – and then the prisons seem insufficient.
    This is not communism. This is big business – American big business. The Korean people have had enough of it. They want to unite their country, govern it in their own way, and benefit all the people of North and South Korea.
    The "disgruntled soldier" Stilwell used to call the Nanjing government "a pile of dung" and Chiang Kai-shek "a peanut." The Seoul government is another pile of dung, and Syngman Rhee is an even more miserable peanut. Syngman Rhee had long wanted to launch a vicious offensive against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north. His last hope was the five-star chapter. He sighed that the word from Washington was: Wait until the time is ripe. All of this was reported by the *New York Herald Tribune* on November 1 last year. The *Times* confirmed it last Monday.
    In Washington's ripened June, when its own regime was on the verge of collapse, would the increasingly reckless Syngman Rhee have acted ahead of schedule? Just when Syngman Rhee's rapid decline was about to open the path to peaceful reunification, would the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – whose parliament included an equal number of representatives from North and South Korea – have had any reason to provoke armed conflict?
    Of course not! Common sense, all the clear facts prove that it was Washington's puppet – not free Korea – that committed the unreasonable act of aggression.
    This aggression was well-prepared. John Foster Dulles first returned from Seoul to Japan. General MacArthur awaited the signal to launch. Today, Korea is being bombed by the U.S. Air Force.
    At this time, it is worth recalling that this same John Foster Dulles had just urged the same provocative war behavior less than two years ago. In fact, this is one reason why the people of New York voted to remove him from public office.
    At this time, it is also worth remembering that MacArthur is an old hand at ruthlessly attacking the poor. The massacre of World War I veterans demanding pensions in the Anacostia neighborhood was under his command.
    These two Wall Street agents are busy laying the foundation for a separate peace with Japan; Japan's surrender terms stipulate the return of Taiwan to China; a separate peace with Japan may include a denial of this agreement.
    This enemy of ours in World War II is preparing to serve as a military base for aggressive war against our allies in World War II – the Soviet Union and China. Another seizure of Manchuria is included in this conspiracy.
    The mass killings currently taking place in Korea are a political act, intended to open the door to direct military action against Taiwan, Indochina, Indonesia, Malaya, and the Philippines. This is an act of aggression – aimed at reconquering free China.
    When the Korean crisis first became clear, all peace-loving people hoped to see the United Nations make a just resolution. I think I am not alone in feeling that this hope has been betrayed. Under the orders of the United States, the Security Council acted with unseemly haste – without even taking the steps to investigate. Who is undermining everyone's confidence in the United Nations, who is slacking off on its work for peace? It is none other than the two-faced Truman government, which is using the United Nations as just another broadcasting station for the "Voice of America."
    Upholding Korea's right to independent and democratic unification, the United Nations is capable of and should fulfill some of the tasks of saving world peace. But if it is to become a true United Nations, it must get rid of the Kuomintang thugs. The People's Republic of China derives its authority from 450 million liberated people.
    As long as the new China is excluded, the United Nations cannot effectively deal with any problem – at least not all the problems of Asia. Therefore, the Soviet Union is now standing outside the Security Council meetings. (Note)
    All peace-loving people, especially we Americans, should now strive to transform the United Nations according to its original purposes and the image of its charter. If we succeed in this cause, then the real United Nations will be able to stop the undeclared war in the Far East, order the withdrawal of all imperialist forces, protect the rights of colonial peoples to independence, and exercise its full potential to prevent the disaster of atomic war.
    There is no such thing as "indirect aggression" in today's Asia. There is only the direct aggression of American imperialists, who are ruthlessly trying to suppress the struggles of peoples who demand that their centuries of grievances be redressed. All of Asia is shaking.
    There is no magical "Asian blood tie" that supposedly makes those nations turn to the Soviet Union as to the rising sun. In the socialist motherland, many countries and nations live together in peace and friendship, free from all oppression and ethnic inequality.
    Why can't the profit-seeking American monopolists win "moral leadership" and break the bonds that connect the Soviet Union with the freedom-craving peoples of the world? The simple reason is this.
    American imperialists learn nothing from failure. They have not yet believed that in the mid-20th century world, there are indeed such people who care about freedom to such an extent that they are unwilling to lie down and be oppressed.
    In China, they conducted a test that sacrificed many Chinese lives and billions of dollars of American workers' blood and sweat. But in the end, these incorrigible interventionists got what they truly deserved – complete and shameful failure.
    They have not yet learned that today, they must reckon with a new people who are fighting through all difficulties because they know what their fight is for. They know how to use the weapons and guns sent to oppose them – American and Japanese guns, besides Russian ones.
    These new people are capable of defeating the instigators of war. There are these kinds of new people in Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam – Asia is full of hundreds of millions of such people. There are these kinds of people in every country – certainly in our country. We understand very well that some will be put in prison. But we also understand that those who remain free will fight more and more fiercely, their numbers only increasing until everyone is free.
    These are the Americans who are now collecting millions of signatures on the Stockholm Peace Appeal... When the jailers of the Cold War put G. Dennis, C. Marzani, G. Marshall, J.H. Lawson, D. Trumbo, E. Baski, H. Fast, and other anti-fascists behind bars, they did not lose their confidence in their own strength.
    I think that now, when the hot war has become a reality, and a new wave of mass arrests and collective trials is threatening us, many Americans will not lose their minds.
    The five million signatures on the Stockholm Peace Declaration will give Mr. Truman a headache! A truly broad outcry, demanding the pardon of those who have become prisoners of the Cold War terror, can promote their release. This has even more significance. For those who have coordinated the new undeclared war and fear the coming bloody terror, this can also have some preventative effect.
    No interference in Korea! Let the Korean people establish a free, unified, and independent country!
    Withdraw the U.S. Navy and Air Force back to their own country! Stop bombing the Korean people!
    Sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal!
    Demand freedom for G. Dennis and others imprisoned for opposing the Cold War!

### 不许干涉朝鲜和台湾！

　　不许干涉朝鲜和台湾！
    美国共产党全国委员会书记  霍尔
    冷战是愈来愈放肆了。杜鲁门总统宣布说：美国已经发动了一种没有宣战的热战来对付亚洲和太平洋的一切民族。美国的海空军是在朝鲜。第七舰队是在台湾海面。在菲律宾的美国军事力量已经加强了。全面的军事援助正在给与印度支那方面的法国帝国主义者，一个美国军事使团现在指挥着那个地区的作战。
    就在命令发出、驱逐舰调去、炸弹投下的时候，就在那时候，杜鲁门方才“悠然地”告知美国人民和联合国，说是没有宣战的战争已经开始了。
    恐怕我们是受到预先警告的罢。一星期左右以前，国务卿艾奇逊承认着：“冷战”这字眼使得人们发寒噤了。他建议着用“通过实力的和平”这些字眼来代替。
    你随意叫它什么罢，总之，我们面对着一种赤裸裸的武装斗争的政策，这为的是帝国主义对远东的霸权——就在远东，成亿的人们为了争取我们美国人在一七七六年所赢得的一些权利正在战斗，正在拚命。
    自从第二次大战结束以来，世界和平没有遭遇过这么严重的危险。什么是我们对于这种挑战的答复呢？我们现在是否应当赶紧设法防避？我们是否必须向这“无可避免”的事情屈服——等候原子的破坏？
    照我们共产党人和其他许多人所说那样，我再说一句——甚至在这预备发动的时刻，第三次世界大战也不是无可避免的。和平还是可以得救。我们把艾奇逊先生的话打回他牙齿里去——对啦，通过实力的和平，通过了联合行动起来的一切爱好和平的人民的实力就在制造战争的野兽们的来路上，挡住它们，消灭它们。
    这就是说，我们美国人必须尽我们所担任的任务。
    在我国独占资本家所控制的报纸上，我们读到的各种故事对于亚洲的真实情况报道得很少。每逢美国工人罢工的时候，从我们自己钢或煤的城市传来的新闻也一样的少。我们大家看惯了狗屁不通的头行标题：“纠察队犯了对和平警察的侵略行为！”我们知道这后面是真实的故事——赶快制度与捱饿工资的故事，正当的要求与膨胀的利润的故事。
    黑种人民对于这类报道是全部清楚的。头行标题惊人地写着——强奸！但真实的故事却关涉着黑人地带的私刑和饥饿，耗子众多的哈立谟贫民窟，以及工业和教育方面的黑人，真实的故事关涉着黑种人民要从华尔街的压迫下解放自己的斗争。
    在亚洲，真实的故事是整个腐败的帝国结构垮下去。全世界成百万的成亿的有色人民正在拆毁殖民地束缚的狱墙。他们受尽了外国主子们的气——日本人、英国人、法国人，或是荷兰人的气。他们亲眼看到：美国制造的帝国主义跟任何别的牌记没有什么差异。
    这成亿的人们所需要的一切，他们坚决非取得不可，因此他们是反对我们的共同敌人，日本帝国主义者们的最好的战士。
    华尔街的南朝鲜有武装部队十万人。星期一早晨的《纽约时报》说：他们“大约是美国军官们所训练的一切外国部队中间最美国化的了”。但是到星期一夜里，无线电却唧咕着：说是在美国制服下面跳着朝鲜人的心，说是甚至那些雇佣兵也不肯用美国枪炮杀他们的朝鲜弟兄们。
    反复的“消灭共产党运动”——仿照着蒋介石的一套——只不过消灭了关于美国帝国主义的一切幻想，使南朝鲜充满了对它的傀儡李承晚的憎恨。
    它拿了好多的“共产主义宣传”使一个民族不肯效忠于熬受饥饿、大量放逐、大量失业、和大量逮捕呵？李承晚集团在南朝鲜的各村庄各里坊设立了小小的非美活动委员会。甚至美国把持的联合国朝鲜委员会也不得不报道：在这种恐怖之下，“一九四八年九月四日到一九四九年四月二十日之间，逮捕了八九、七一○人。”
    刚在昨天，华盛顿传来的话说，“人们总是想望着得到保护，怕夜半抓人、奴隶营、私刑室的。”
    你可知道是谁说了这句话？不是别人，就是哈莱·Ｓ·杜鲁门。这人下令轰炸朝鲜人民，因为他们不但想望着自由，而且为了要得到自由而战斗。
    南朝鲜的工业已经停滞下来。农业呢，汉城的李承晚报纸也只好报道出来，说是农业只不过是逐渐把地力刮尽从而引到饥荒和死亡的问题。只有监狱才给你作安身所——于是监狱显得不够多了。
    这并不是共产主义。这是大企业——美国的大企业。朝鲜人民受尽了它的气了。他们要把自己的国家统一起来，照他们自己的作法来治理，使南北全朝鲜人民都受到利益。
    “失意军人”斯提威尔惯常叫南京政府“大粪堆”，叫蒋介石“花生米”。汉城政府是又一个大粪堆，李承晚是更凄凉的花生米。李承晚是好久以前就要对北部的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国来一次凶恶的攻势的。他的最后希望是五星章。他唉声叹气地说过：从华盛顿传来的话是：且等到时间成熟罢。这一切是去年十一月一日《纽约先锋论坛报》所报道的。上星期一的《时报》加以证实了。
    在华盛顿的时间成熟了的六月里，本身的政权快要崩溃，冒失得越发厉害的李承晚可会不如期行动的么？就在李承晚的急速没落快把和平统一的道路打开的时候，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国——它的议会是包括着南北朝鲜人数相等的代表的——可会有想要挑拨武装冲突的任何理由么？
    当然，不会的！常识，一切已经明白的事实都证明着：是华盛顿的傀儡——不是自由朝鲜，犯了无理的侵略行为。
    这侵略是有好好的准备的。约翰·福斯德·杜勒斯先从汉城回到日本去。麦克阿瑟将军等候着发动的信号。今天，朝鲜正在受着美国空军的轰炸。
    这时候，大可以回忆一下这同一约翰·福斯德·杜勒斯在不到两年以前，恰催促过同样的挑拨战争的行为。事实上，这就是纽约人民所以投票解除他的公共机关职务的一个理由。
    这时候，又可以想一想麦克阿瑟正是杀人不眨眼地攻击穷苦人民的老手。在阿奈索斯底亚的里坊对第一次世界大战军人要求恤金运动者们的屠杀，就是他指挥的。
    这两个华尔街代理人忙着要为对日本的单独媾和打好基础；日本的投降条款规定着台湾归还中国，对日本的单独媾和说不定会包括到对于这项协议的抵赖。
    我们在第二次世界大战的这个敌国正在准备着：要为针对我们在第二次世界大战的盟国——苏联和中国的侵略战争，充当军事根据地。又一次对满洲的强夺是包括在这阴谋荷包里的。
    在朝鲜现在进行着的大批杀人的暴行是一个政治动作，用意就在给针对台湾、印度支那、印度尼西亚、马来亚和菲律宾的直接军事行动打开门户。这是侵略行为——以重新征服自由中国为目的。
    当朝鲜的危机最初搞明白的时候，一切爱好和平的人民抱着希望，看联合国怎样做出公正的解决。我想，在感觉到这个希望被出卖了的时候，我并不是孤独的。在美国的命令之下，安全理事会以不得体的匆促态度行动着——甚至没有进行调查的步骤。谁在破坏大家对联合国的信心，谁在对它争取和平的工作怠工呢？无非是两副面孔的杜鲁门政府，这政府把联合国充当“美国之音”的又一个广播台了。
    拥护着朝鲜走向独立和民主的统一的权利，联合国是能够而应当尽挽救世界和平的一些任务的。但如果它要成为名符其实的联合国，它就必须叫国民党痞棍们滚蛋。中华人民共和国是从四亿五千万被解放的人民得到它的权威的。
    在新中国被撇开的期间，联合国不能有效地处理任何问题——至少可以说，亚洲的一切问题。因此苏联现在是站在安全理事会的历次会议的外边。（注）
    一切爱好和平的人民，首先是我们美国人现在应当努力按照联合国的原初目的和宪章的形象来改造联合国。如果在这项事业上我们成功了，那么真正的联合国就能够制止远东方面没有宣战的战争，命令一切帝国主义的武力撤退，保护各殖民地民族走向独立的权利，并且行使它的全部潜在势力来防免原子战争的灾难了。
    在今日的亚洲没有所谓“间接侵略”。有的只是美国帝国主义者的直接侵略，它残酷无情地一味想把要求平雪自己百年来的冤恨的人民的斗争压制下去。全亚洲震动了。
    在那儿又没有什么神奇的“亚洲血领带”，据说是使那些民族像朝向初升的太阳一样，朝向苏联的。在社会主义祖国，许多的国家和民族和平友爱地生活在一起，摆脱了各种的压迫和种族不平等。
    为什么利润追求狂的美国独占资本家们不能赢得“道德的领导”，不能破坏那些使苏联跟世界渴求自由的人民连结起来的纽带呢？简单的理由就如此。
    美国帝国主义者们从失败中领略不到什么。他们还没有相信：在这世纪中叶的世界，真是有着这么一种人民，他们对于自由，关心到这样的程度，竟至于不肯横倒身子听受压迫了。
    在中国，他们做过了一次考验，这考验是断送了许多中国人的生命，和几十亿美元美国工人的血汗的。但是到头呢，这些无可救药的干涉主义者们却得到了他们真正该受的——完全的而且可耻的失败。
    他们又还没有领略到：在今天，他们必须估量到一种新的人民，他们是对一切艰难战斗的，因为他们知道自己的战斗为着什么。他们知道怎样使用那些为反对他们而送来的武器和枪炮——美国的和日本的枪炮，在俄国的以外。
    这些新的人民是能够战败战争的挑拨者的。在朝鲜、台湾和越南都有这一类新的人民——在亚洲就满是成亿成亿的这样的人民。这一类的人民在每一个国家里都有——在我国当然有。我们很明白：有些会被放进监牢里去的。但是我们也明白：那些保持着自由的人们却战斗得愈来愈猛，人数只是增长着，直到大家都自由了为止。
    这些就是现在征集着斯德哥尔摩和平担保书上成百万人签名的美国人……当冷战的牢吏把Ｇ·但尼斯、Ｃ·马若尼、Ｇ·马谢尔、Ｊ·Ｈ·劳生、Ｄ·杜仑波、Ｅ·白斯基、Ｈ·法斯德及其他反法西斯人士放到监牢铁栅后面的时候，他们没有失掉了对自己的力量的确信。
    我想，现在，当热战变成了现实，大量抓人和集体审判的新浪潮正在威胁我们的时候，许多美国人是不至于丧失理智的。
    斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上的五百万人签名，会叫杜鲁门先生伤伤脑筋！一种真正广泛的呼噪，要求赦放那些已做冷战恐怖的囚犯的人们的呼噪是可以促进开释他们的。这还有更多的意义。对于那些配合了新的没有宣战的战争，怕要到来的血腥恐怖，这也可以起些防止作用的。
    不许干涉朝鲜！让朝鲜人民建立一个自由、统一和独立的国家！
    把美国海军和空军撤回本国来！阻止轰炸朝鲜人民！
    在斯德哥尔摩和平担保书上签名！
    为Ｇ·但尼斯及其他为反对冷战而被囚的人们要求自由！
