　　Accusations Against the Laboring People Should Not Be Met with Delay
    Meng Tieping's Letter Criticizes the Xiuwu County Government and Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office

　　Editor Comrade:
    I am writing to you about an example of government staff treating the complaints of the masses with a bureaucratic attitude.

    In Qiao Xinzhuang, Fourth District, Xiuwu County, there is a man named Qin Shuli. He was originally a worker at the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, with a family of three and no land. During the Kuomintang rule, he was fired for inciting coal miners to demand holiday benefits. After returning home, he was allocated three and a half mu of land in 1946. However, in January of this year, Qiao Zhenzhong, a local tyrant in the county, colluded with individual village cadres to reclaim his land. Qin Shuli became very anxious after this issue arose and immediately appealed to the district. The first time, Deputy District Chief Liu of the district handled it, forbidding the village cadres from changing the land allocation. When the village did not resolve the issue, he found District Chief Chang, who also wrote a letter to the village cadres instructing them not to alter the allocation. But the problem remained unresolved. In March, because land rights in the village were not finalized, the local tyrant Qiao Zhenzhong destroyed the seedlings on his land. Qin Shuli sought help from district staff member Feng Zhouguo to resolve the issue, but Feng shirked responsibility. He went to the district government three times. Secretary Chen of the district government not only failed to inquire about the situation in detail or solve his problem, but also withheld all of Qin Shuli's evidence and letters. Afterwards, Qin went to the district three or four more times to retrieve them, but they were not returned. He then found Cao, the District Party Committee Secretary. Cao replied, "If Secretary Chen does not return your documents, you can sue him." Qin Shuli then sought a resolution from the county government. The county government ordered the district to handle it, but without result. Qin repeatedly went to the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, requesting a solution to his problem. On one occasion, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office ordered County Chief Ren to resolve it. However, the county government told him to go to the Judicial Section, which then told him to go to the Civil Affairs Section. As a result, he was passed around, and the problem remained unresolved. On May 2nd, Qin Shuli found the Civil Affairs Department of the Pingyuan Provincial Government, which wrote him a letter instructing him to return and ask the Prefectural Commissioner's Office to resolve the issue. Still, there was no resolution. Later, he went to the Provincial Court twice and formally filed a lawsuit. However, the court did not accept it, saying it should be resolved by the county and instructed him to await processing.

    From the time this matter occurred until now, Qin Shuli has been to the Prefectural Commissioner's Office seven or eight times, to the county more than ten times, and to the province three times. The last time was on July 20th, when he went to the Provincial Court to request a judgment. The court did not accept it, and he went to the Civil Affairs Department again. His problem is not complex or impossible to solve; the main issue lies in the bureaucratic phenomenon among the government agencies at various levels handling this problem.

    I believe that regardless of whether Qin Shuli's demands are correct or not, the People's Government should handle them. I request that the Xiuwu County People's Government and the Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office, which have adopted a delaying attitude toward this matter, be inspected and publicly criticized in the newspaper in order to improve our work.
                Pingyuan Provincial Civil Affairs Department, Meng Tieping

### 对劳动人民的控诉  不应采取拖延态度  孟铁平来信批评修武县府新乡专署

　　对劳动人民的控诉  不应采取拖延态度
    孟铁平来信批评修武县府新乡专署
　　编辑同志：
    我告诉你一件政府工作人员以官僚主义态度对待群众控诉的例子。
    修武县四区乔新庄有一个秦树立，他原是焦作煤矿的工人，家有三口人，原来无地。在国民党统治时代，他因发动煤矿工人要求过节面而被开除。他回家后，在一九四六年曾分到三亩半地。但至今年一月，该县恶霸乔振忠串通了个别村干，要将他的土地要回。这个问题发生后，秦树立非常焦急，即到区申诉。第一次由该区刘副区长处理，不准村干部变动此项土地。村里没有解决问题，他又找到常区长，区长也写信告诉村干部不准变动。但问题仍未解决。三月间，由于村里地权未定，恶霸乔振忠竟将他地上的春苗毁坏。秦树立找区工作员冯周国解决，冯推诿不管。三次找到区政府。区政府陈秘书，不但未详细询问情况，给他解决问题，反将秦树立的一切证据信件扣留不还。以后秦曾到区要过三、四次仍不给。随又找到该区曹区委书记。曹答复说：如陈秘书不给你的证件可告他。秦树立就找县府解决。县府令区处理，也无结果。秦又数次到新乡专署，要求解决他的问题。其中一次专署曾令县府任县长解决。但县府叫找司法科，司法科又叫他找民政科。结果推来推去，问题仍没解决。五月二日，秦树立找到平原省府民政厅，民政厅给他写了信，叫他回去请专署解决。还是没有结果。后来他又到省法院二次，正式起诉。但法院没有受理，说由县解决，叫他本人听候处理。
    自此事发生到现在，秦树立共到专署七、八次，到县十余次，来省三次。最后一次是七月二十日，他到省法院请求判决，法院未受理，他又到民政厅。他的问题并不是复杂无法解决的，主要在于处理这一问题的各级政府机构中有官僚主义的现象。
    我认为：不管秦树立的要求正确与否，人民政府都应予以处理。我要求对这事采取拖延态度的修武县人民政府及新乡专署进行检查，在报纸上公开发表，以便改进我们的工作。
