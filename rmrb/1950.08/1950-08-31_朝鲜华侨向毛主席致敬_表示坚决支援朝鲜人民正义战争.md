　　Xinhua News Agency, 30th. According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, overseas Chinese in North Korea enthusiastically held commemorative meetings on the "August 15th" anniversary of Korea's liberation, even amidst the brutal devastation caused by American imperialist aircraft. The Pyongyang Overseas Chinese Celebration Conference passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao. The letter stated: "American imperialism is frantically invading Korea and attempting to obstruct our People's Liberation Army from liberating the ancestral territory of Taiwan, further interfering with the independence and liberation of the Asian people. But we believe that this act of aggression will be completely crushed in the face of the awakened people of the East. We firmly respond to your call, vowing to unite with the Korean people and the people of the world, to support the people of the motherland in liberating Taiwan, and to support the Korean people's just war to achieve final victory. Let the American imperialists tremble and weep before the invincible Chinese and Korean people!"
