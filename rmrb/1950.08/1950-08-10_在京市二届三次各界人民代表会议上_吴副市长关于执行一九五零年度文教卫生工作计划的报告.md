Report by Vice Mayor Wu on the Implementation of the 1950 Cultural, Educational, and Health Work Plan at the Second Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference

Fellow Representatives:

　　At the previous Representatives Conference, a work plan with the guiding principle of "serving production and serving the working people" was adopted regarding cultural, educational, and health work. Now, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, I will report to the conference on the implementation of this plan. The report is divided into four parts: The first part is about after-school education and social education. This is part of our implementation of the above-mentioned guiding principle. In the past six months, we have gained some experience and made preliminary summaries. The remaining parts are: the second part on school education, the third part on literary and artistic work, and the fourth part on public health work. These areas are also being implemented according to the above-mentioned guiding principle. The summary of experience of these tasks will be reported later. Now, I will just talk about their work situation.

    First, Regarding After-School Education and Other Social Education Work

　　According to the resolution of the First Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference, the After-School Education Work Committee was established in mid-February. It vigorously prepared for the establishment of formal after-school supplementary schools to accommodate 30,000 people. School construction began in mid-March. The first phase of the school construction plan was originally scheduled to end at the end of April, but many units are still opening schools one after another. There are currently 46 schools that have opened, with a total of 30,156 students enrolled. Among them, 23,388 are industrial workers, accounting for 77.6% of the total number of students; 4,873 are on-the-job cadres, accounting for 16.1% of the total number of students; and 1,895 are service personnel, accounting for 6.3% of the total number of students. If we include the 21,079 students enrolled in the adult supplementary schools and farmer supplementary schools run by the Bureau of Culture and Education, and the 10,197 students enrolled in the worker supplementary schools run by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, then there are currently 61,432 working people in Beijing studying culture. During the period of reactionary rule, most of these working people had no opportunity to learn culture. Now that they have the opportunity they never dreamed of in the past, they are very happy and study very actively. Therefore, since the opening of the after-school schools, not many students have dropped out. Some schools have continued to increase the number of students enrolled after the start of classes. Although there are differences in the degree of absenteeism in various schools, there is generally a pattern. After-school schools run by a single unit have less absenteeism. After-school schools run by various districts have more absenteeism. For example, the People's Bank has only 2% absenteeism, the Qingguan Bureau has 7%, and the rest are all below 20%, while after-school schools jointly run by administrative districts are around 25%. Generally speaking, absenteeism is not very serious. In general after-school schools, it is very common to have 20% or 30% absenteeism due to factory overtime or busy government affairs. It is impossible to completely eliminate or significantly reduce absenteeism, but it is our duty to reduce the absenteeism rate as much as possible.

　　Now, I would like to briefly talk about a few main issues based on the experience of the first phase of school construction:

　　(1) Guiding Principles of After-School School Education

　　According to the resolution of the First Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference and the Implementation Outline for After-School Education, the following main principles have been implemented:

　　(1) First, target industrial workers and government staff.

　　(2) There must be full-time teachers and dedicated teaching materials.

　　(3) Formalization under certain conditions.

　　(4) Focus on learning cultural courses.

　　(5) Study time is outside of production time.

　　The conditional formalization of after-school schools has caused some disagreements among some cadres, especially regarding the principle of focusing on learning cultural courses. Many factory and government cadres have raised objections. They advocated not adopting a formal form, and that political classes should be set up in the courses. After repeated discussions, a consensus was reached: Formal education forms must be adopted as much as possible if conditions permit; where conditions are insufficient or impossible to formalize, literacy classes and cultural classes should be adopted; existing literacy classes, etc., should continue to be maintained; enrollment of students should be based on the principle of voluntariness, and forced orders are absolutely not allowed; and it is planned to take the method of mutual learning and help, cultivate "little teachers" from the students of after-school schools to help workers or cadres who cannot enroll in literacy education. In this way, after-school schools and general literacy classes can be carried out separately, while also being combined with each other to achieve mutual assistance. In after-school schools, Chinese and general knowledge textbooks all contain political content, and each class has three lessons per week. The rest of the time can still be used for political education or other activities, so there is no special political class. As for study time, we strictly implemented the principle of conducting studies outside of production and work time. In order to ensure the implementation of this principle, a roll call and leave system, a teacher make-up class system, and a student mutual assistance system were established.（⑸⑹）

　　(2) Organization and Leadership

　　There are three ways to establish after-school schools: some are established by a single unit (factory or government agency), some are jointly established by several units, and some are established by administrative district.

　　Each school has a school affairs committee, with the负责人负责人 of each factory, government agency, or administrative district concurrently serving as the principal. Under the school affairs committee, there is a dean of teaching affairs who leads the teaching affairs of the entire school. Each class has a class teacher, who is concurrently held by a full-time teacher, who leads the study of the entire class. The students in each class are divided into several study groups according to their work department and residential area, and each group elects a leader to assist the class teacher in student mutual learning. The advantage of this organizational form and leadership form is that it achieves close cooperation and assistance from all relevant parties; the teaching business is mainly the responsibility of the full-time teaching director and teachers, which is the basic condition for consolidating the school; the students who participate in the study are also organized, which also plays a certain role in guaranteeing the adherence to the study system and improving the learning mood. However, the leadership systems of after-school schools, worker supplementary schools, and adult night schools in Beijing are not unified, and in specific work, duplication or dispersion of forces is inevitable. And some formal after-school schools established by administrative district contain as many as forty factories and government units, lacking a leadership center. This shows that it needs to be led by a unified cultural and educational authority, with organizations at all levels from top to bottom, to fundamentally solve these problems.

　　(3) Teachers, Teaching Methods, and Teaching Materials

　　There are currently 479 teachers in after-school schools, of which 202 are full-time teachers, accounting for 42% of the total. They are uniformly registered, reviewed, trained, and assigned by the After-School Education Work Committee. The number of teaching hours they undertake accounts for two-thirds of the total number of hours. They are mainly responsible for the teaching work and play a decisive role. There are 277 part-time teachers, accounting for 58% of the total. They are hired by the schools themselves. Most of them are on-the-job cadres from various factories and government agencies, and a small number are on-the-job teachers from primary and secondary schools and students from universities.

　　In terms of teaching methods, we do not yet have mature and comprehensive experience. Generally speaking, history classes are closely integrated with political thought, so they are all taught by cadres concurrently. Chinese classes focus on the laws of language and knowledge education. Some units teach grammar, punctuation marks, or phonetic alphabets, which are very popular with students. Adult education should pay special attention to the connection between theory and practice. Therefore, Chinese classes should teach more application writing and practice more. Natural science classes should be improved on the basis of adults’ life experience, do more experiments, and add necessary wall charts and instruments. Otherwise, they will simply not come to listen.

　　In terms of teaching materials, according to the prescribed academic system curriculum standards, the editorial committee, assisted by the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Department of Culture and Education of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, compiled 9 volumes of Chinese, 9 volumes of arithmetic, and 6 volumes of general knowledge, a total of 24 volumes, within two months. According to current statistics, more than 420,000 copies of the three textbooks have been distributed. Chinese and arithmetic are divided into nine volumes in order to suit the uneven level of cadres and facilitate class division.

　　(4) Funding and School Buildings

　　According to regulations, the funding for after-school schools is paid by the trade union's cultural and educational expenses, partially subsidized by the factory and government agencies, and the rest is subsidized by the government.

　　According to statistics from 37 schools, the cultural and educational expenses of the trade union and the administrative subsidies of the factory and government agencies total 20,534 catties of millet per month, accounting for 17% of the total expenditure; the government subsidizes a total of 99,034 catties of millet per month, accounting for 83% of the total expenditure. In addition, start-up funds totaling 46,622 catties of millet were subsidized to 22 schools.

　　As of the end of June, the After-School Education Work Committee has subsidized a total of 339,856 catties of millet to various schools (including start-up funds and recurring expenses). The subsidy funds are strictly reviewed by the Beijing Municipal After-School Education Work Committee and individually negotiated, and budgets and final accounts are drawn up, and then spent according to the system. This expenditure is naturally not a small amount given the current financial difficulties of the government, but workers are an important pillar responsible for developing production and building the country. In the city, they are the basic strength of our country. The state can use just a few hundred thousand catties of millet to enable more than 60,000 workers and other laboring people to begin to improve their cultural level, and thus also improve their political and technical business levels, so that the basic team of our country can make up for cultural defects. It should be said that this is very cost-effective and completely necessary.

　　The school buildings of after-school schools, in the schools of administrative districts and government agencies, all borrow the school buildings of general primary and secondary schools in the district. In large factories in the suburbs or far from the city center, some borrow canteens, dormitories, factories and offices.

　　(5) Direction of Future Efforts

　　The main task in the future is to consolidate the established after-school schools and develop steadily. We are preparing to work hard in three aspects:

　　(1) Improve the political and professional level of teachers, which is the central link in consolidating and developing after-school schools. Because the main shortcoming of teachers in after-school schools at present is their low political level. The students they teach, however, are workers and cadres with a high level of political awareness among the people. The Chinese language, history, and geography courses also contain a lot of political content. If teachers cannot meet the requirements of students in this regard, it will be difficult to achieve the teaching effect. Therefore, we have formulated a study plan for the learning problems of teachers and are preparing to organize the political study and professional study of teachers at the same time, with political study as the main focus. This study is now underway.

　　(2) Supervision work will be carried out, taking general supervision and key supervision, to check and improve the work of various after-school schools. At the same time, a small publication will be published to guide work, exchange experience, and conduct criticism and encouragement.

　　(3) Many shortcomings have been found in the textbooks of after-school schools during teaching. We are preparing to collect information one after another and modify them.

　　In addition to vigorously running after-school schools, we also assisted the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government in establishing an experimental worker-peasant rapid middle school in this city to cultivate new-type intellectuals of workers and peasants.

　　In the urban area, for adult supplementary schools, we first selected the original 5th, 6th, and 9th districts with better work as key points, and each established a central adult night school as a demonstration. We have rectified the original adult supplementary schools. As of the end of June, there were 434 adult night school classes with 13,922 students; and two teacher training sessions for adult night schools and worker night schools were held, with a total of 142 participants.

　　In the 280 administrative villages in the suburbs, 253 administrative villages have set up 152 farmer supplementary schools with a total of 244 classes and 7,157 students. In order to improve the teaching effect, some teachers in adult supplementary schools in urban and suburban areas are given appropriate living subsidies to stabilize their working mood.

　　Consolidate and appropriately develop children's literacy classes. As of the end of June, there were 785 children's literacy classes in the urban area with 24,919 students. Some teachers who are active in their work and have difficulties in life are also given appropriate subsidies. It is planned to add 350 more classes in the second half of the year, including 196 classes in the suburbs, 94 classes in the outer city, and 60 classes in the inner city, as much as possible to meet the requirements of the children of the working people to enroll in school.

　　In addition, in addition to allocating book and newspaper fees to general social education agencies, we have also added 3 loudspeakers and 20 radios, and added 6 book and newspaper reading rooms; the cultural center has not been added because it cannot find suitable housing in time and lacks experienced social education work cadres. We will strive to complete the expansion plan in the second half of the year and decide to hold a training class for social education work cadres to meet the needs. The ban on old "picture books" is a matter of general citizen ideological education and must be approached with caution. Investigation and research work is currently underway.

    Second, Regarding School Education Work

　　(1) Improvement and Reform of Primary and Secondary Education, and Early Childhood Education

　　Some improvements and reforms have been made to the original primary and secondary schools and kindergartens. In order to improve the teaching staff, the Beijing Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Study Committee was established in April. The current study policy was determined, with political study as the main focus, combined with business research, to improve the political level of teachers and staff, further establish the idea of serving the people, and improve teaching methods. A secretariat was set up under the Study Committee to be responsible for organizing, promoting, and inspecting the work. Some special reports have been made in accordance with the study plan for the first half of the year, and observation and teaching of history and Chinese have been held.

　　In order to improve administrative leadership, adjustments have been made to the responsible personnel of some schools. Combined with democratic salary assessment, the full-time system for teachers in municipal middle schools has been further implemented, and the unreasonable phenomenon of part-time teaching has been basically eliminated.

　　In order to strengthen the political education of middle school students, the political teaching materials and the teaching progress of the political class have been unified. In order to expand teaching equipment, more than 819,000 catties of millet have been issued to various municipal middle schools for library fees and instrument fees in the first half of the year. Moreover, according to the spirit of establishing a science museum proposed by the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference, more instruments have been allocated to municipal No. 2 Middle School, No. 4 Middle School, No. 8 Middle School, and No. 2 Girls' Middle School, which are located in suitable locations and have better conditions; so that private middle schools with insufficient equipment can also use the equipment of municipal middle schools. It is still planned to make possible additions in the second half of the year to further enrich teaching equipment.

　　For private primary and secondary schools, according to the policy of supporting and improving decided by the last meeting, during the winter vacation, a few private middle schools that were poorly managed and had insufficient funding and equipment, or had too few students, and applied for suspension or merger, were rectified separately. The suspension of Weixin Middle School and Shixi Middle School was approved. Xinqing Girls' Middle School was approved for takeover, and students were assigned to municipal middle schools. Jinzhi Middle School and Minguo Middle School were allowed to merge and renamed Xinzhong Middle School. Qiushi Middle School and Jinde Middle School were merged and renamed Xinzhi Middle School. And helped Fen Dou Middle School move to Suiyuan. Yanshan Middle School was merged into the Hui Nationality Academy. At the same time, 500,000 catties of millet were subsidized to more than 30 schools, including Xinsheng Middle School, which was better managed and had economic difficulties or needed funds for rectification. In view of the economic difficulties of private primary and secondary schools, we have formulated interim measures for subsidizing the funding of private middle schools, which have been promulgated and implemented in June.

　　In addition, we have also called on private primary and secondary schools to implement the full-time system for teachers and the class teacher system under economic conditions to improve the teaching effect. At the same time, we have strengthened the supervision work of private primary and secondary schools, established a regular meeting and reporting system, organized small-scale private school symposiums, and provided help and guidance in a timely manner.

　　In order to improve students' lives and health, in March, middle school students were mobilized to engage in agricultural production during their spare time. 72 schools participated, with more than 27,000 students. The students' production enthusiasm was generally very high. Now, many schools have harvested early-maturing crops, and the food has generally been improved. The Municipal School Health Committee was established on April 1, and hygiene equipment fees of 34,000 catties of millet were issued to municipal middle schools to purchase necessary hygiene equipment to strengthen students' hygiene and health care work.

　　(2) The Problem of Increasing Classes and Schools in Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools

　　In terms of primary schools, it was originally planned to add 15 classes each in urban and suburban areas in the first half of the year, and 25 classes in urban areas in the second half of the year. In the urban area, 16 classes have now been added, which can accommodate 890 students; in the suburban area, 10 schools have been added as of the end of June, with a total of 23 classes, enrolling 1,150 students. In addition, the primary school attached to the railway inspection section in the 13th district has been taken over by the municipal government and changed to a municipal primary school, with 4 classes and 200 students (the funding is an additional suburban class increase budget). In total, 27 classes have been added in the suburbs.

　　In terms of secondary schools, because the autumn semester has started, no classes have been added in the first half of the year. It has now been decided to add 13 classes in vocational schools (technical schools) during the summer vacation, including 9 classes in industrial schools, and add a motor and electrical engineering department. 4 classes in financial and economic schools (formerly municipal high school), and add statistics and business administration departments. 5 or 6 classes will be added to normal schools, including 2 classes of ordinary normal classes, 2 classes of early childhood normal classes (one of which should have been increased in the winter vacation of this year, but was changed to enroll students in the summer vacation of this year in order to unify the academic system), and 1 or 2 classes of primary school teachers and staff training classes. 31 classes will be added to ordinary middle schools, including 9 classes in high school and 22 classes in junior high school. In addition, a worker-peasant rapid middle school and three ordinary middle schools (two in the southern city, one for boys and one for girls; the other in Changxindian) will be added. The number of classes will be determined separately according to the school buildings. Some worker-peasant children are less advanced and cannot enter ordinary classes, so several preparatory classes will be set up as needed.

    Third, Regarding Literary and Artistic Work

　　Under the general policy of cooperating with production tasks and widely carrying out the popularization of literature and art, the following main tasks were carried out:

　　(1) The Literary and Art Department of the Bureau of Culture and Education and the Federation of Trade Unions cooperated to establish the Factory Literary and Art Work Committee, and cooperated with the Student Federation to establish the School Literary and Art Work Committee, and through cultural centers, adult night schools, etc., launched guidance work for mass literary and artistic activities.

　　(2) In order to improve opera, a opera training class was held, with a total of more than 1,500 graduates in two phases, laying a preliminary foundation for the ideological transformation and business improvement of the opera industry. After graduation, the opera department of the amateur art school was organized. In order to further improve the political and professional level of the old artists and jointly promote the opera reform movement.

　　(3) 17 kinds of popular literary and artistic reading materials were edited, with 3,000 copies per edition, and a literary and artistic monthly magazine "Talking and Singing" was published, with a distribution of 28,000 copies. Helped the Literary and Art Creation Research Association to hold 23 weekly literary and art lectures, with a cumulative audience of about 10,000 people, to promote the popularization of literature and art. In addition, excellent dramas and movies that conform to the new democratic education policy are given tax reductions as rewards, and good dramas and movies are promoted by means of criticism or recommendation.

　　At the end of May, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles was helped to convene the Beijing Literary and Art Circles Congress, which will greatly promote the unity of new and old literary and art workers, the establishment of a united front in the Beijing literary and art circles, and the promotion of the people's literary and art movement.

    Fourth, Regarding Public Health Work

　　According to the work plan for 1950, under the policy of prevention first, the following main tasks were carried out:

　　(1) Epidemic Prevention and Hygiene: Preventive injections such as typhoid fever, cholera, and diphtheria, and preventive vaccinations of cowpox and BCG were carried out in a focused manner, which have been effective. For example, compared with the same period last year, the number of smallpox patients has decreased from 190 to 11; the number of deaths has decreased from 90 to 4. And solved the disinfection problem of tap water and drinking wells; carried out the spring and summer epidemic prevention propaganda campaign.

　　(2) Maternal and Child Health: In order to take care of poor women and enjoy scientific midwifery, obstetricians, midwives, and public and private hospitals were organized by district to provide free delivery for poor women, and 10 public and private hospitals were specially appointed for dystocia, and the government subsidized them according to the number of deliveries and hospitalizations. The old midwives were registered and trained, and 107 have been trained. Health checks were carried out for children and childcare workers in nurseries and kindergartens and given guidance. A maternal and child health exhibition in urban and suburban areas was held in conjunction with the March 8th Festival.

　　(3) School, Industrial and Mining Hygiene: In order to improve school hygiene work, as mentioned above, the School Hygiene Committee has been established, with branches in each district and branches in each school, and hygiene teams have been organized, and doctors and nurses have been added. Now, preliminary medical and health work has been carried out for more than 70,000 students in 179 schools. The hygiene conditions of industrial and mining areas are generally bad. In the past few months, 162 public and private factories (mines) with more than 30 people have been investigated in the city, including more than 22,000 employees; at the same time, key inspections have been carried out on the Mentougou mining area and the Danhua Match Factory, and there have been partial improvements. A hygiene hospital is planned to be set up in the Mentougou mining area, with an affiliated hospital. The location has been surveyed in Chengzicun, and drawings and valuations have been made. It is currently in progress. Five worker clinics have been set up in areas where the working people are more concentrated. In addition, in order to facilitate workers' medical treatment, at the Municipal Hospital, those who hold a letter of introduction from the factory or trade union can be diagnosed and treated first, and pay the fees later or pay in installments by the trade union. It should be said that our work on industrial and mining hygiene is still very insufficient and relatively slow, which is what we need to pay attention to in the future.

　　(4) In order to take care of the medical convenience of the working people, 44 free public and private medical units and 10 free hospitalization units have been designated, and it is planned to provide free outpatient services to 976 people per day and 174 free beds per month, and the government will subsidize them. Subsidized 4 medical cooperatives in the suburbs. In addition, a health center was established in Dachoucang and Fengtai, where the working people live, and a maternal and child health center was established outside Chongwenmen; and the health center in Changxindian was reorganized into a health center, so that the unbalanced distribution of hospitals and health agencies in the city has begun to be gradually corrected. The Municipal No. 1 and No. 3 Hospitals and the Mental Illness Prevention and Treatment Hospital have all increased the number of beds and outpatient visits.

　　The above is the report on cultural, educational, and health work in the past six months. Among them, after-school education work was mainly reported, because the establishment of after-school schools is still a new problem, and there are many experiences worth introducing, and it is an important resolution of the First Session of the Second Representatives Conference. The report on public health work is relatively simple.

### 在京市二届三次各界人民代表会议上  吴副市长关于执行一九五零年度文教卫生工作计划的报告

1950-08-10
第5版()
专栏：

　　在京市二届三次各界人民代表会议上
    吴副市长关于执行一九五零年度文教卫生工作计划的报告各位代表：
    前次代表会议关于文教卫生工作，曾通过了以“为生产服务，为劳动人民服务”为方针的工作计划。现在，我代表北京市人民政府向大会报告关于这个计划的执行情况。报告分四部分：第一部分是关于业余教育和社会教育，这是我们执行上述方针的一部分，半年来我们已经得到一些经验，作出初步的总结。其余第二部分是学校教育，第三部分是文艺工作，第四部分是公共卫生工作，这几项也是按照上述方针执行的。这几项工作的经验总结，须等以后再报告，现在，只把它们的工作情况说一说。
    第一、关于业余教育和其他社会教育工作
    根据本市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议的决议，在二月中旬，即成立了业余教育工作委员会，用大力筹办准备容纳三万人的正规业余补习学校，三月中旬开始建校工作。第一期建校计划，原定四月底结束，但至今仍有很多单位陆续开办。现在已经开学的计有四十六校，入学的学员共三万零一百五十六人。其中，产业工人二万三千三百八十八人，占入学总人数的百分之七十七点六；在职干部四千八百七十三人，占入学总人数的百分之十六点一；勤杂人员一千八百九十五人，占入学总人数的百分之六点三。如果把文教局所办的成人补习学校和农民补习学校入学的二万一千零七十九人以及市总工会所办的工人补习学校一万零一百九十七人合计在内，那么，北京市的劳动人民现在有六万一千四百三十二人在学习文化。这些劳动人民在反动统治时期，绝大部分是没有学习文化的机会的，现在得到过去所梦想不到的机会，都很高兴，很积极地学习。因此，业余学校开学以来，学员退学的不多，有些学校在开课之后，入学人数仍继续增加。各校缺课现象，虽有程度上的不同，但大体上有一个规律，一个单位单独办的业余学校缺课的比较少，各区办的业余学校缺课的比较多，如人民银行缺课的只有百分之二，清管局是百分之七，其余都在百分之二十以下，而以行政区为单位联合举办的业余学校都在百分之二十五左右。总起来说，缺课并不十分严重，一般业余学校由于工厂加班或机关业务的繁忙等，缺课十分之二、三是很平常的现象，要求完全消灭或大量减少缺课现象是不可能的，但尽可能地降低缺课率，是我们必须努力的。
    现在，我想根据第一期建校工作的经验，就几个主要问题简要地说一下：
    （一）业余学校教育方针
    根据北京市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议的决议和业余教育实施纲要，执行了以下的几个主要方针：
    （１）首先以产业工人和机关工作人员为对象。
    （２）须有专任的教员和专用的教材。
    （３）有条件地正规化。
    （４）以学习文化课程为主。
    （５）学习时间在生产时间以外。
    对于业余学校有条件地正规化，曾引起一些干部们的异议，特别是对于以学习文化课程为主的方针，有不少的工厂和机关干部提出过异议，他们主张不采取正规的形式，课程中应设有政治课，经过反复商讨，才取得了一致的意见，就是：在条件许可下必须尽可能采取正规的教育形式；在条件不足或不可能正规化的地方，采取识字班、文化班等形式；已有的识字班等仍应继续保持；学员入学根据自愿原则，绝对不许强迫命令；准备采取学习互助的办法，从业余学校的学员中培养“小先生”，去帮助不能入学的工人或干部进行识字教育。这样，使业余学校和一般的识字班分别进行，同时又互相结合，取得互助之效。在业余学校，国文和常识课本中都包含着政治的内容，而且各班每周上课三次，其余的时间仍可进行政治教育或其他活动，所以不专设政治课。至于学习时间，我们严格执行了在生产和业务的时间以外进行学习的方针，为了保证这一方针的贯彻，建立了点名、请假制度和教员补课及学生互助制度。（⑸⑹）
    （二）组织与领导
    业余学校的建立，有三种方式：有的是由一个单位（工厂或机关）单独建立，有的是由几个单位联合建立，也有的是以行政区为单位建立起来的。
    各校都设有校务委员会，由各工厂机关或行政区的负责人兼任校长，在校务委员会之下设教务主任，领导全校的教学业务。各班有班主任，由专任教员兼任，领导全班的学习。各班学员按照工作部门和居住地区分编若干学习小组，各选组长一人，协助班主任进行学员学习互助。这样的组织形式和领导形式，好处是取得各有关方面的密切配合协助；教学业务由专任的教务主任和教员负主要责任，这是巩固学校的基本条件；参加学习的学员也都组织起来了，对坚持学习制度和提高学习情绪，也起了一定的保证作用。但是北京市的业余学校、工人补习学校、成人夜校，领导系统不统一，在具体工作上就不免重复或分散力量，而以行政区为单位所建立的正规业余学校，有的包含多至四十多个的工厂和机关单位，缺乏领导中心。这就说明，需要由一个文教机关统一来领导，有从上到下的各级组织，才能把这些问题根本解决。
    （三）教员、教学方法和教材
    业余学校目前共有教员四百七十九人，其中，专任教员二百零二人，占全数百分之四十二，由业余教育工作委员会统一登记、审查、训练、分配；担任的授课时数占总时数的三分之二，对教学工作负有主要的责任，并起着决定的作用。兼任教员二百七十七人，占全数百分之五十八，由各学校自行聘请。其中，大部分是各工厂机关的在职干部，少数是中小学在职教员和大中学校学生。
    在教学方法方面，我们还没有成熟的全面的经验，一般地说，历史课因与政治思想密切结合，所以都由干部兼任。国文课着重语文规律和知识教育，有些单位教文法，标点符号，或注音字母等，很得学员的欢迎。成人教育应特别注意理论与实践相联系，因此，国文课应多教应用文，多作练习，自然课应从成人的生活经验基础上提高，多作实验，添置必要的挂图、仪器，不然，他们会干脆不来听。
    在教材方面，是根据规定的学制课程标准，由中央人民政府教育部社教司和全国总工会文教部帮助组成的编委会，在两个月内，编成国文九册、算术九册、常识六册，共二十四册。据现在统计，三种课本共已发行四十二万余册。国语、算术都分编九册，是为了适合干部中程度不齐的特点，便于分班。
    （四）经费与校舍
    业余学校的经费按照规定是由工会文教费内支付一部分，工厂机关的行政上补助一部分，其余由政府补助。
    根据三十七个学校的统计，工会文教费和工厂机关的行政补助每月共收二万零五百三十四斤小米，占总开支百分之十七；政府补助每月共九万九千零三十四斤小米，占总开支百分之八十三。此外，并补助了二十二个学校的开办费，共四万六千六百二十二斤小米。
    到六月底为止，业余教育工作委员会对各校经费的补助（包括开办费和经常费）共计三十三万九千八百五十六斤小米。补助费都是经过北京市业余教育工作委员会严格审查和个别协商，订出预算和决算，然后根据制度开支的。这笔开支，在政府目前财政困难的情形下，自然是一个不小的数目，但是工人是担负发展生产建设国家的重要支柱，在城市中，是我们国家的基本力量，国家仅仅用几十万斤小米的开支，就能使六万多工人和其他劳动人民中的积极分子来开始提高文化程度，因而也就会连带提高他们的政治和技术业务水平，使我们国家的基本队伍能够补足文化上的缺陷，应该说，这是十分合算，也是完全必要的。
    业余学校的校舍，在行政区和机关的学校，都借用所在区的一般中小学校校舍，在郊外或离市中心区较远的大工厂，有的借用食堂、宿舍、厂房和办公室。
    （五）今后努力的方向
    今后的主要任务，是巩固已建立的业余学校，稳步发展，我们准备从三方面努力：
    （１）提高教员的政治水平与业务水平，这是巩固和发展业余学校的中心环节。因为目前业余学校的教员主要的缺点是政治水平低。而他们所教的学员，却是人民中政治觉悟较高的工人和干部，课程中的国文、史地也包含了许多政治的内容，教员们如果在这方面不能满足学员的要求，就很难达成教学的效果。因此，我们对教员的学习问题，已经拟定一个学习计划，准备同时组织教员的政治学习与业务学习，而以政治学习为主。这个学习正在开始进行。
    （２）视导工作，采取一般的视导与重点视导，去检查并改进各业余学校的工作。同时，出版一种小型刊物，用来指导工作，交流经验，进行批评与鼓励。
    （３）业余学校的课本，在教学当中，已经发现了许多缺点，我们准备陆续收集资料，加以修改。
    社会教育工作，除以大力举办了业余学校之外，我们并协助中央人民政府教育部，创办了本市实验工农速成中学一所，以培养工农新型知识分子。
    在城区，对成人补习学校，先选择工作较好的原五、六、九区三个区为重点，各建立了一个中心成人夜校，以为示范。对原有的成人补习学校则进行了整顿，截至六月底，计有成人夜校四百三十四班，学员一万三千九百二十二人；并举办过两次成人夜校和工人夜校师资训练，参加的共计一百四十二人。
    在郊区二百八十个行政村中，有二百五十三个行政村已设有农民补习学校共一百五十二所，计二百四十四班，学员七千一百五十七人。为提高教学效果，对城郊成人补习学校部分教员酌予生活补助，以安定其工作情绪。
    整顿并适当发展儿童识字班。截至六月底，城区儿童识字班共有七百八十五班，学生二万四千九百一十九人。对部分工作积极，生活困难的教师也酌量给以补助。准备下半年再增设三百五十班，计郊区一百九十六班，外城区九十四班，内城区六十班，尽可能的满足劳动人民子弟入学的要求。
    此外，对一般社教机关于拨发书报费外，还添置了扩音器三部，收音机二十架，并增设了六个书报阅览室；文化馆因为不能及时觅得适当的房舍，又缺乏有一定经验的社教工作干部，尚未增设，下半年当努力完成增设计划，决定举办社教工作干部讲习班，以应需要。对旧“小人书”的取缔，因为是一般市民思想教育的问题，必须审慎从事，现正进行调查研究工作。
    第二、关于学校教育工作
    （一）中小学、幼稚教育的改进与改革
    对原有的中小学和幼稚园进行了一些改进和改革。为提高师资于四月间成立了本市中小学教职员学习委员会。确定当前学习方针，以政治学习为主，结合研究业务，以提高教职员的政治水平，进一步树立为人民服务的思想，并改进教学方法。在学委会下设干事会，负责组织、推动与检查工作，现已按照上半年的学习计划作过一些专题报告，并举办了历史、国文观摩教学。
    为了改善行政领导，对有些学校的负责人员进行了调整，结合民主评薪，进一步贯彻了市立中学教员专任制，基本上消灭了不合理的兼课现象。
    为加强中等学校学生的政治教育，统一了政治教材和政治课的教学进度。为了扩充教学设备，上半年发给各市立中学图书费和仪器费八十一万九千余斤小米。并且，根据本市各界人民代表会议提议建立科学馆的精神，有重点地分配给地点适中和条件较好的市立二中、四中、八中、女二中等校以较多的仪器；使设备不足的私立中学也能利用市立中学设备，下半年仍计划作可能的补充，以进一步充实教学设备。
    对私立中小学，根据上次会议所决定的扶植改进方针，在寒假期间，对少数办理不善及因经费设备不足，或学生人数过少，申请停办或合并的私立中学，分别予以整顿。计：维新中学、世熙中学准予停办。新青女中准予接管，学生编入市立中学。准许近智中学和民国中学合并，改名新中中学。求实中学和进德中学合并，改名新知中学。并帮助奋斗中学迁往绥远。燕山中学并入回民学院。同时，补助办理较好而经济困难或因整顿需款的新生中学等三十余校小米五十万斤。我们鉴于私立中小学的经济困难，制订了私立中学校经费补助暂行办法，已于六月公布施行。
    此外，并号召私立中小学在经济条件许可下，实行教员专任制和班主任制，以提高教学效果，同时，加强了对私立中小学校的视导工作，建立定期的会议、汇报制度，组织小型私立学校座谈会，及时予以帮助指导。
    为改善学生的生活和健康状况，三月间发动中等学校学生从事课余农业生产，参加生产者七十二校，计有学生二万七千多人，学生的生产情绪普遍很高。现在，许多学校已经收获了早熟作物，伙食一般地得到改善。四月一日成立了本市学校卫生委员会，并对市立中学发给卫生设备费三万四千斤小米，购置必要的卫生器材，以加强学生的卫生保健工作。
    （二）市立中小学的增班、增校问题
    在小学方面，原计划上半年在城、郊区各增设十五班，下半年再在城区增设二十五班。在城区，现已增设了十六班，可容纳学生八百九十人；在郊区，则截至六月底已增十校，计二十三班，招收学生一千一百五十人。另外，十三区铁路检车段附设的小学，已由市府接办，改为市立小学，计有四班，学生二百人（经费系追加郊区增班预算），总计郊区共增设了二十七班。
    在中等学校方面，因为秋季始业，上半年没有增班，现已决定于暑期中，职业学校（技术学校）增设十三班，计工业学校九班，并增设电机科。财经学校（原市立高商）四班，并增设统计、工商管理二科。师范学校增设五、六班，计普通师范班二班，幼稚师范班二班（其中，一班原应于本年寒假递增，为统一学制，改在今年暑期招生）及小学教职员轮训班一、二班。普通中学增设三十一班，计高中九班，初中二十二班。此外，并增设工农速成中学一所和普通中学三所（二所在南城，男、女各一；另一所在长辛店），班次将根据校舍另定。工农子弟有些程度较差，不能入普通班，则视需要另设几个预备班。
    第三、关于文艺工作
    在配合生产任务，广泛地开展文艺普及工作的总方针下，主要进行了以下各种工作：
    （一）由文教局文艺处和总工会配合成立了工厂文艺工作委员会，又和学联配合，成立了学校文艺工作委员会，并通过文化馆，成人夜校等，展开了对群众性的文艺活动的辅导工作。
    （二）为了改进戏曲，举办了戏曲讲习班，两期共毕业学员一千五百余人，初步打下了戏曲界思想改造和业务改进的基础。毕业后，组织了业余艺术学校戏曲部。以便更进一步地提高旧艺人的政治水平和业务水平，共同推进戏曲改革运动。
    （三）编辑通俗文艺读物十七种，每版三千册，文艺月刊“说说唱唱”一种，发行二万八千分。帮助文艺创作研究会举办星期文艺讲座二十三次，听众累计约万余人，以推进文艺的普及工作。另外，对于优秀的符合于新民主主义教育方针的戏剧电影则减免税以资奖励，并以批评或推荐的方法去提倡好戏和好电影。
    五月底，帮助文联召开了北京市文艺界代表大会，对于团结新旧文艺工作者，建立北京文艺界统一战线，推进人民的文艺运动，将有很大的推动作用。
    第四、关于公共卫生工作
    根据一九五○年度的工作计划，在预防为主的方针下，主要进行了以下的工作：
    （一）防疫卫生：有重点地进行了伤寒、霍乱、白喉等预防注射和牛痘、卡介苗的预防接种工作，已著成效，如天花以今年五个月和去年同期相比，患者从一百九十人，减至十一人；死亡者从九十人，减至四人。并解决了自来水与饮水用井的消毒问题；进行了春夏两季的防疫宣传运动。
    （二）妇幼卫生：为照顾贫苦产妇，享受科学助产，按区组织了开业的产科医师、助产士和公私医院，为贫苦的产妇免费接生，为难产者特约了公私医院十处，由政府按接生人数和住院次数予以补助。对旧有的接生婆，进行了登记和训练，已训练者计一百零七人，对托儿所幼稚园的儿童和保育人员进行了健康检查，并给以指导。配合三八节进行了城郊区的妇幼卫生展览。
    （三）学校、工矿卫生：为改善学校卫生工作，如前所述，已成立学校卫生委员会，各区设分会，各校设支会，并组织卫生队，增聘医师、护士，现在对一百七十九校，七万多学生，已经作了初步的医疗卫生工作。工矿的卫生状况，一般是恶劣的，数月来调查了市内三十人以上的公私营工厂（矿）一百六十二家，包括职工二万二千余人；同时，对门头沟矿区和丹华火柴厂进行了重点检查，并已有局部的改善。在门头沟矿区计划设卫生院一处，并附设医院，已在城子村勘定地点，绘图估价，现正在进行中。在劳动人民比较集中的地方，已设置了五个工人诊疗所。此外，为照顾工人诊疗方便，在市立医院，凡持有厂方或工会负责介绍信者，可先行诊治，缓交费用或由工会负责分期交付。应当说，我们关于工矿卫生工作，还作的非常不够，并且比较迟缓，这是我们今后需要注意的。
    （四）为了照顾劳动人民的医疗便利，已指定免费公私医疗单位四十四处，免费住院单位十处，预定每天免费门诊九百七十六人，免费病床每月一百七十四张，由政府予以补助，补助郊区医药合作社四处。此外，在劳动人民聚居的地区大后仓、丰台各设立了卫生所一处；在崇外设立了妇幼保健所一处；并将长辛店的卫生院改组为卫生所，从而已开始将本市医院卫生机关分布的不平衡状况，陆续矫正。而市立第一、第三医院，精神病防治院都增加了病床和门诊数量。
    以上是半年来关于文教卫生工作方面的报告。在这中间着重地报告了业余教育工作，因为业余学校的创办，还是一个新的问题，有许多经验值得介绍，并且是第二届第一次代表会议的一个重要决议。对于公共卫生工作则报告的比较简单。
