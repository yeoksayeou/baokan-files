Heavy Rains in Beijing Cause Widespread Flooding and House Collapses
    Dilapidated Houses Should be Repaired Immediately
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Beijing News Agency: On August 2nd and 3rd, heavy rains in Beijing caused house collapses and other disasters. Throughout the city, 1,019 houses completely collapsed and 2,891 houses partially collapsed; 64 citizens were injured and 6 died. Government departments have carried out emergency rescue operations for the affected households.
    The third district, eighth district, and eastern suburbs were the most severely affected. In the third district, 265 houses completely collapsed and 849 houses partially collapsed; 12 citizens were injured and 1 died. In the An'nanying area near the city wall, the water was more than a foot deep due to the low terrain, and more than 90 nearby households were flooded. In the eighth district, 266 houses completely collapsed and 345 houses partially collapsed; 7 citizens were injured and 1 died. In Neiguang'an Dongli and Guang'an Xili, the water was more than two feet deep and could not be drained due to the lack of sewers, flooding more than 2,000 households. In the eastern suburbs, 126 houses completely collapsed and 662 houses partially collapsed; 2 citizens died, with more houses collapsing in the Chaowai Guanxiang and Dongzhimenwai Guanxiang areas.
    During the disaster, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Bureau of Public Health and Engineering, the Suburban Work Committee, and the district offices all took timely emergency measures to minimize the loss of life and property for citizens. In addition to the Bureau of Public Health and Engineering organizing a "drainage flying squad" with three trucks and necessary equipment and manpower to be dispatched at any time for emergency repairs, the public security sub-bureaus also mobilized the masses to actively dig ditches for drainage. They also worked with the district offices to resettle some citizens who had nowhere to live due to house collapses, and rescued injured citizens and transferred them to hospitals for treatment. In addition, they investigated the households living in dangerous houses that were likely to collapse, and advised them to move out to avoid harm. The district offices and public security sub-bureaus also did their best to solve the relocation problem.
    In the rescue and prevention work, many police officers of the Public Security Bureau demonstrated a high degree of dedication to serving the people. For example, police officers Chen Qiyuan and Chen Baorui from the Tenth Police Station of the Third Sub-bureau braved the rain to rescue Liu Guishi, a pregnant woman who was injured by falling debris, and sent her to the hospital, saving her from danger. Wei Xing, the director of the Ninth Police Station of the Fourth Sub-bureau, braved the rain to lead the masses in building dikes to block the water, and moved more than 30 women, children, and patients who had suffered in the collapsed houses to a safe place, and personally cooked and boiled water for them. This spirit of serving the people has been praised by the local masses. There were also police officers on duty who, in the heavy rain in the middle of the night, saw that the houses of residents were in danger of collapsing, and immediately knocked on the door to advise the residents inside to evacuate quickly, and arranged for them to be resettled in a safe place.
    The main reason for this disaster is that the vast majority of citizens lived in poverty under the rule of the reactionary forces in the past, the construction of houses was not solid, and they had been in disrepair for many years. Secondly, the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits did not dredge the sewers and drainage ditches such as the moat in Beijing for many years, resulting in most of them being silted up and losing their drainage function. After liberation, the Municipal People's Government has vigorously dredged and excavated, and has made considerable achievements, but has not yet been fully resolved due to time and financial constraints. On the other hand, the housing rental relationship is still not normal, which has also affected the timely repair of houses. Therefore, in order to prevent the harm of continuous rain and protect the safety of people's lives and property, on the one hand, the vast majority of citizens should repair the houses they live in or rent in a timely manner; the housing rental problem should be resolved reasonably; and the responsible departments should inspect the houses that are no longer being taken care of to clarify the responsibility for their repair and maintenance.

### 京市霪雨成灾房屋倒塌很多  破旧房屋应赶紧修理

　　京市霪雨成灾房屋倒塌很多
    破旧房屋应赶紧修理
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：八月二、三两日，京市大雨，发生房屋倒塌灾害。全市房屋有一○一九间全塌，二八九一间半塌；市民受伤六十四人，死亡六人。对受灾各户，政府各主管部门曾进行了紧急的抢救。
    此次灾情以第三区、第八区、东郊等地区为重。第三区房屋全塌二六五间，半塌八四九间，市民受伤十二人，死亡一人。临近城根的安南营一带，因地势低，积水一尺多深，附近九十多家住户，均被水侵入。第八区房屋全塌二六六间，半塌三四五间，市民受伤七人，死亡一人。内广安东里、广安西里因没有下水道，积水二尺多深，无法泄出，二千余户被水侵入。东郊地区房屋全塌一二六间，半塌六六二间，市民死亡二人，以朝外关厢和东直门外关厢一带塌房较多。
    此次灾害中，市公安局、卫生工程局、郊区工作委员会和各区公所，都及时进行了紧急措施，使市民减少了生命财产的损失。除由卫生工程局以三辆卡车及必要的器材和人力组织“排水飞班”随时出动抢修外，各公安分局并发动群众积极挖沟排水，协同区公所将一些因房屋倒塌无处居住的市民，设法予以安置，并抢救受伤市民转送医院救治。另外，并调查有塌倒可能之危险房屋住户，劝告迁出，以免受害。关于迁出居住问题，各区公所和公安分局也尽力设法解决。
    在抢救和预防工作中，公安局的许多干警，表现了高度的为人民服务的精神。如三分局第十派出所警士陈起元、陈宝瑞，冒雨抢救被砸伤的孕妇刘桂氏，送往医院，使她得免于难；外四分局第九派出所所长韦行，冒雨领导群众筑堤挡水，并将塌房受难的妇孺、病人三十余名迁到安全地方，还亲自给他们煮饭烧水。这种为人民服务的精神，都受到了当地群众的赞扬。还有值班的警士，在深夜大雨中，见居民房屋有倒塌危险的，即敲门劝告屋里的居民赶紧避出，并将他们安置在安全地点。
    造成此次灾害的主要原因，是广大市民过去在反动派统治下生活贫困，房屋建筑不固，又多年久失修。其次是日寇和国民党匪帮，对京市的下水道及护城河等排水沟道，多年不加疏浚，以致大部淤塞，失掉排水作用。解放后市人民政府虽大力疏浚掏挖，已有了不少成绩，但限于时间和财力，尚未全部解决。另一方面，房屋租赁关系还不正常，也影响了房屋的及时修缮。因此，为防止霪雨为害，保护人民生命财产的安全。一方面是广大市民对所住或出租的房屋，应时加修缮；房租问题应求得合理解决；对已无人保管的房屋，应由主管部门进行检查，明确其修缮保管责任。
