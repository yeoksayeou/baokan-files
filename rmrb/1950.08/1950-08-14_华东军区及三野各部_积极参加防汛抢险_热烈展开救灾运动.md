Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 12th: The commanders and fighters of the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the various units of the Third Field Army are actively participating in flood prevention, rescue, and disaster relief work in various locations. After the Huai River, Wo River, and Sha River in northern Anhui breached their banks in early July, all units of the Anhui North Military Region immediately投入 themselves into rescue and disaster relief work. Units stationed further away also dispatched flood prevention and rescue teams to rush to the disaster areas overnight to rescue disaster victims. Commanders and fighters of a certain unit stationed in Fuyang rescued more than 20,000 disaster victims in the heavy wind and rain for several days in assisting the local government. All personnel of the East China Military Region's Veterans School in northern Anhui also actively participated in rescue and disaster relief work. Many commanders and fighters who were wounded and disabled in the People's Liberation War also formed groups to help each other and persevere in their work, strengthening the confidence of nearby residents in rescue and disaster relief. In addition to actively participating in rescue work, the troops of the Anhui North Military Region also launched a campaign to save one or two liang of rice per person per day for disaster relief. Commanders and fighters have been actively donating allowances, daily necessities, and clothing to help disaster victims.

Troops in other regions are also stepping up their efforts to assist the masses in digging ditches, repairing dikes, and preventing floods. The Anqing Military Subdistrict troops repaired 275 meters of the Yangtze River dike and moved 44,500 cubic meters of earth in nineteen days. The troops of the Northern Jiangsu Military Region have all been mobilized to actively participate in the construction of the Grand Canal and the Hongze Lake dam to prevent the August floods. Troops stationed on both sides of the Yangtze River and in coastal areas have also generally established flood prevention and rescue teams to assist local people in protecting and repairing embankments and sea dikes. In June and July, a certain unit of the Third Field Army stationed in eastern Zhejiang assisted the local people in completing the construction of sea dikes in Zhenhai, Cixi, and Yuyao, with a total length of 110 kilometers.

    【新华社南京十二日电】人民解放军华东军区和第三野战军各部指战员积极参加各地的防汛、抢险、救灾等工作。皖北淮河、涡河、沙河于上月初旬决堤后，皖北军区各部队即全部投入抢险、救灾工作。驻地较远的部队也都派出防汛抢救队连夜赶往灾区抢救灾民。驻阜阳某部指战员连日在大风雨中协助当地政府抢救出灾民两万余人。皖北的华东军区荣誉军人学校全体人员也积极参加抢险、救灾工作。很多在人民解放战争中负伤残废的指战员也都编成小组，互相协助坚持工作，加强了附近居民抢险、救灾的信心。皖北军区部队除积极参加抢险工作外，并开展每人每日节约一两米救灾的运动，指战员们纷纷自动捐出津贴、日用品、衣物救助灾民。
    其他各地区的部队也正在加紧协助群众挖沟、修堤，防止水患。安庆军分区部队十九天内修复江堤二百七十五公尺，挑土四万四千五百方。苏北军区部队已全部动员起来，积极参加修筑运河和洪泽湖大堤的工作，防止八月大汛。驻长江两岸及沿海地区的部队也都普遍成立防汛抢救队，协助当地人民保护和修筑堤岸、海塘。驻浙东的第三野战军某部于六、七月份内协助当地人民完成修筑镇海、慈谿 、余姚一带的海塘共长一百一十公里。
