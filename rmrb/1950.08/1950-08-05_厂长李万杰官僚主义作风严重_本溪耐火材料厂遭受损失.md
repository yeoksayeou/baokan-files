　　Factory Director Li Wanjie's Serious Bureaucratic Work Style Causes Losses to Benxi Refractory Material Factory

　　[Our Newspaper Benxi News] Since April, the Baojia Refractory Material Factory of Benxi Coal and Iron Company has not only failed to complete its production tasks, but most of its product quality has also failed to meet standards. Serious accidents have occurred repeatedly, directly wasting a huge amount of national wealth and causing significant difficulties and losses to major production departments that need refractory materials. This is mainly the result of the serious bureaucratic work style of the factory director, Li Wanjie.

　　Factory Director Li Wanjie's mistakes can be seen from the following three main aspects:

　　1. In terms of production management: Production plans are consistently drafted by a small number of administrative cadres and technicians. They are neither discussed by the Management Committee, nor consulted with Party and union cadres, let alone mobilizing the masses to study them. Because the production plan cannot be grasped by the masses, the monthly production tasks cannot be completed. Some technical regulations are blindly modified without absorbing the production experience and wisdom of the workers. For example, the expansion force of silica bricks has always been specified at 30 percent, but Li Wanjie subjectively modified it to 40 percent, resulting in a loss of more than 1 billion (Northeast currency) in one instance. The adoption of a new kiln loading method caused the collapse of brick blanks, wasting more than 500 man-days.

　　2. In terms of cadre policy, instead of adopting the policy of uniting the progressive and transforming the backward, he approached and promoted cadres based on his own preconceived notions. As a result, the morale of the workers was scattered, affecting unity, and completely losing the leadership's prestige.

　　3. He does not respect the leadership of the Party, and undermines the principle of "unity and consistency between the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League to develop production." Factory Director Li Wanjie mistakenly believes that administration is the highest-ranking, first-class cadre, so he refused to talk to the branch secretary and evaded ideological struggles within the Party.

　　Factory Director Li Wanjie's non-proletarian ideology and serious bureaucratic work style have caused extremely serious consequences. Now, with the help and education of the higher-level Party committee, he has begun to conduct self-criticism, but the phenomenon of not daring to face up to mistakes and fearing punishment still needs to be overcome with continued efforts.

　　厂长李万杰官僚主义作风严重
    本溪耐火材料厂遭受损失
    【本报本溪讯】本溪煤铁公司鲍家耐火材料厂，自四月份以来，不仅生产任务完不成，产品质量也大部不合规格，严重事故一再发生，直接浪费了国家巨额财富，并使需要耐火材料的主要生产部门遭受到重大的困难与损失。这主要是该厂厂长李万杰存在严重的官僚主义作风的结果。
    该厂厂长李万杰的错误，可以从以下三个主要方面来看：
    一、在生产管理方面：生产计划，一贯是由少数行政干部和技术人员拟订。既不经管委会讨论，也不和党、工干部商量，更不发动群众研究。因为生产计划不能为群众所掌握，每月的生产任务也就不能完成。对于有些技术规程盲目修改，不吸收工人的生产经验和智慧。如矽石砖的膨胀力，一贯都用百分之三十的规格，李万杰却主观地修改为百分之四十，一次即损失十余亿（东北币、下同）；采用新装窑法，造成砖坯倒塌事故，浪费人工五百多个。
    二、在干部政策上，不是采取团结进步、改造落后的方针，而是凭着自己的框子，接近和提拔干部。结果闹得职工情绪涣散，影响团结，且使领导威信完全丧失。
    三、不尊重党的领导，破坏了党、政、工、团“团结一致发展生产”的原则。李万杰错误地认为：行政是高过一切的一等干部，因此他拒绝了支部书记的谈话，逃避了党内的思想斗争。
    李万杰厂长的非无产阶级的思想意识和严重的官僚主义作风，造成了极为严重的恶果。现在在上级党委的帮助和教育下，已开始进行检讨，但不敢正视错误和害怕处分的现象尚待继续努力克服。
