Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: To overcome the chaotic phenomena in production and construction, scientific planning work will soon be piloted in national state-owned heavy industrial departments. This decision was made at the planning conference of the Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry held from July 10th to 29th.

The planning conference of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, based on the long-term vision of the national state-owned heavy industry's five-year construction and the general situation of major products and basic construction in 1951 as instructed by the Financial and Economic Commission of the Central People's Government, and combined with the specific conditions of various factories and mines, determined the revised draft of the 1951 production plans for steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, and other industries of national state-owned heavy industry, and drafted the investment amount for basic construction of national state-owned heavy industry in 1951 (Northeast region planned separately). The specific production and basic construction plans for 1951 will be compiled accordingly. The conference requested that all factories and mines quickly improve their planning and statistical work organizations, carefully calculate various work indices, formulate various technical and economic norms, and formulate technical operating procedures; at the same time, it required the heads of each unit to personally take action and organize capable personnel from the entire factory to participate in this work. In order to meet the needs of future construction, the conference decided to cultivate sufficient technical cadres and skilled workers as early as possible according to the construction plan.

When summarizing past planning work, the conference pointed out that the 1950 plan was actually only a cumulative production figure based on the estimated production capacity of various regions. This plan, first of all, failed to take into account the relationship between supply and demand, resulting in oversupply or unmet demand for certain products in the first half of the year, leading to a large backlog of products and inflexible capital turnover; or, due to insufficient contact between supply and demand sides, products that could already be self-made were still being applied for import. Secondly, the formulation of this plan failed to take into account the conditions of technical labor and lacked sufficient preparation, so that even if there was a plan, it could not be implemented, and even if there was investment, it could not be fully utilized. Thirdly, the plan only sought quantity and did not emphasize quality, and failed to consider basic construction from a global perspective, resulting in a waste of manpower and materials.

　　克服生产建设中的混乱现象
    全国国营重工业各部门将试行科学的计划工作
    【新华社三日讯】为克服生产建设中的混乱现象，科学的计划工作即将在全国国营重工业部门开始试行。七月十日至二十九日举行的中央人民政府重工业部计划会议对此已作出决定。
    重工业部的计划会议，根据中央人民政府财经委员会指示的国营重工业五年建设远景及一九五一年主要产品和基本建设的大概情况，结合各厂矿具体情况，确定了一九五一年全国国营重工业的钢铁、有色金属、化工等生产计划的修正案，拟定了一九五一年全国国营重工业（东北区另行计划）基本建设的投资额。一九五一年生产与基本建设的具体计划即将据此编制。会议要求各厂矿迅速健全计划与统计工作机构，详细核算各种工作指数，拟定各种技术经济定额，制订技术操作规程；同时要求各单位首长亲自动手，并组织全厂得力人员参加这一工作。为适应今后建设的需要，会议决定根据建设计划及早培养足够的技术干部与技工。
    会议在总结过去的计划工作时指出：一九五○年的计划，实际上仅系各地区根据生产能力的估计而累计起来的生产数字。这个计划，首先是未能照顾到供求关系，以致上半年某些产品供过于求或供非所求，而致产品大量积压，资金周转不灵；或因供求双方联系不够，致使已能自制的产品仍被申请入口。其次，这一计划的制订，未能照顾到技术劳动的条件，缺乏足够的准备，以致虽有计划而无法实施，虽有投资而不能充分运用。再次，计划中只求数量不重质量，未能从全局来考虑基本建设，以致造成人力和物资的浪费。
